2432
01:07:57,660 --> 01:07:58,220
Hello?

2433
01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:00,320
Hello, hello.

2434
01:08:01,080 --> 01:08:01,580
Oh, hey.

2435
01:08:01,720 --> 01:08:03,760
Is it my Zangief Senpai?

2436
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:04,140
Oh, my god.

2437
01:08:04,240 --> 01:08:06,120
Is this my fellow Gief player?

2438
01:08:06,180 --> 01:08:08,500
Wait, are you actually playing Gief in the fighter?

2439
01:08:09,360 --> 01:08:09,620
Ask Ellen.

2440
01:08:11,080 --> 01:08:16,100
No, I fucking 5-0'd Sykkuno and mindbroken him into Zangief.

2441
01:08:16,580 --> 01:08:20,060
Well, that's a weird way to say showed me the light.

2442
01:08:21,860 --> 01:08:25,020
Yeah, he was a filthy Cammy player.

2443
01:08:27,420 --> 01:08:34,740
Honestly, you saved me from arthritis, you saved me from struggles, weeks of training, and my life is better now.

2444
01:08:34,740 --> 01:08:36,800
Why the fuck did he not do modern Cammy?

2445
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:38,560
Why were you doing classic Cammy?

2446
01:08:39,360 --> 01:08:40,160
He tries to do it in hard mode.

2447
01:08:40,280 --> 01:08:41,600
He tries to do it in hard mode.

2448
01:08:41,680 --> 01:08:42,340
That's the reason why.

2449
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:44,080
Dude, dude, why even?

2450
01:08:44,180 --> 01:08:44,900
I'm just playing Zangief.

2451
01:08:44,900 --> 01:08:45,120
Wait.

2452
01:08:45,300 --> 01:08:46,360
Okay, hold on, hold on.

2453
01:08:46,420 --> 01:08:47,020
I'm gonna lock in.

2454
01:08:47,080 --> 01:08:48,780
I'm against a Cammy right now in ranked.

2455
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:49,740
Oh, shit.

2456
01:08:49,980 --> 01:08:52,520
If I lose this, I go back to Cammy.

2457
01:08:52,520 --> 01:08:54,800
I'm also a goated Gief player.

2458
01:08:54,840 --> 01:08:55,760
Wait, this guy's crazy.

2459
01:08:55,860 --> 01:08:56,140
What the?

2460
01:08:57,400 --> 01:08:59,360
He's playing modern Cammy.

2461
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:03,400
You could have literally played modern Cammy and then it would have been easier.

2462
01:09:04,060 --> 01:09:05,580
He's getting his ass kicked, dude.

2463
01:09:05,760 --> 01:09:07,840
He's literally on modern controls.

2464
01:09:08,840 --> 01:09:10,660
How are you doing moves like that?

2465
01:09:10,700 --> 01:09:12,280
It took me weeks to even do half of that.

2466
01:09:12,740 --> 01:09:14,200
That's what modern is.

2467
01:09:14,780 --> 01:09:17,220
You know how Gief has one button in modern?

2468
01:09:17,540 --> 01:09:17,740
You know how Gief has one button in modern?

2469
01:09:17,740 --> 01:09:19,640
Cammy has one button in modern.

2470
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:22,300
Okay, guys, which is the one button you're pressing?

2471
01:09:22,320 --> 01:09:24,860
Because I'm on modern on a keyboard and I can't find the button.

2472
01:09:25,200 --> 01:09:27,400
Yeah, I'm on leverless.

2473
01:09:27,700 --> 01:09:28,980
My button's a triangle.

2474
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:30,940
What about on a keyboard?

2475
01:09:31,840 --> 01:09:33,080
I don't fucking know what you're on.

2476
01:09:33,820 --> 01:09:34,900
Grab a controller.

2477
01:09:35,360 --> 01:09:36,740
I don't have a controller.

2478
01:09:36,800 --> 01:09:37,220
Grab a fucking PlayStation.

2479
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:38,440
I don't have one.

2480
01:09:38,500 --> 01:09:39,060
It's the triangle.

2481
01:09:40,940 --> 01:09:41,340
Hewn!

2482
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:45,000
You don't have a controller for what?

2483
01:09:45,380 --> 01:09:46,860
Oh, you're talking about Street Fighter.

2484
01:09:47,180 --> 01:09:47,520
Yeah.

2485
01:09:48,300 --> 01:09:50,200
We all play the same character.

2486
01:09:51,680 --> 01:09:52,280
Wait, really?

2487
01:09:52,620 --> 01:09:54,840
Yeah, but Hewn likes fighting games.

2488
01:09:54,920 --> 01:09:55,620
He likes to watch them though.

2489
01:09:55,880 --> 01:09:59,220
But, you know, maybe there's a world we get to try Street Fighter, guys.

2490
01:09:59,280 --> 01:10:02,160
Maybe there's a world at some point.

2491
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:03,840
And hopefully we're living in the world.

2492
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:05,600
Who is Sykkuno playing against tomorrow?

2493
01:10:05,900 --> 01:10:06,840
Who are you playing against tomorrow?

2494
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:09,260
Dude, dude, this guy's fucking me.

2495
01:10:09,260 --> 01:10:09,540
Hold on.

2496
01:10:09,660 --> 01:10:10,160
Dude.

2497
01:10:10,320 --> 01:10:12,280
Dude, he is dialed in.

2498
01:10:12,660 --> 01:10:22,340
By the way, I don't think you should play Gief tomorrow because Seratina and you're playing as Seratina tomorrow and she's actively training against Gief.

2499
01:10:23,180 --> 01:10:24,120
Yeah, dude.

2500
01:10:24,240 --> 01:10:27,300
She's gonna lose to Zangief twice and never play the game again.

2501
01:10:28,720 --> 01:10:31,980
She's literally training just to play against Gief.

2502
01:10:32,100 --> 01:10:35,700
Wait, how do you train specifically against one character?

2503
01:10:36,020 --> 01:10:37,680
Like, how do you... Just keep playing.

2504
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:38,320
against him, really.

2505
01:10:39,220 --> 01:10:46,000
Basically, she got one of our coaches as a modern Zangief player and she got him to coach her.

2506
01:10:46,180 --> 01:10:46,760
Dude, how is this...

2507
01:10:46,760 --> 01:10:50,840
Is that like... Which is the most simple character to play?

2508
01:10:51,040 --> 01:10:52,480
Is it Gief or is it like...

2509
01:10:52,480 --> 01:10:52,480
Zangief.

2510
01:10:54,340 --> 01:10:54,820
Really?

2511
01:10:54,820 --> 01:10:55,740
Okay, okay.

2512
01:10:56,260 --> 01:10:58,600
Well, if you're a beginner, it's the easiest.

2513
01:11:02,220 --> 01:11:05,620
Why don't you just play... What is this character called?

2514
01:11:05,620 --> 01:11:06,320
Blanka?

2515
01:11:06,720 --> 01:11:07,900
Isn't he really...

2516
01:11:07,900 --> 01:11:08,940
Blanka?

2517
01:11:09,900 --> 01:11:11,540
He's like... He's so-so.

2518
01:11:11,660 --> 01:11:12,400
I don't know.

2519
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:15,400
I haven't played him, but I don't see a lot of Blanka in rank.

2520
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:19,600
Oh, I was watching the... Chat, I am so sorry.

2521
01:11:20,240 --> 01:11:22,520
My... Guys, I wouldn't allow it for you, dude.

2522
01:11:22,740 --> 01:11:25,880
My volume in my ears was at max volume.

2523
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:28,920
Like, literally a max volume.

2524
01:11:28,960 --> 01:11:31,240
Yeah, even like right now, the meta is like... Dude.

2525
01:11:31,880 --> 01:11:33,560
Um, I don't like...

2526
01:11:33,560 --> 01:11:34,420
It is.

2527
01:11:34,700 --> 01:11:35,340
Isn't Cammy...

2528
01:11:35,620 --> 01:11:36,680
I need new airdrops.

2529
01:11:37,660 --> 01:11:38,640
For this year?

2530
01:11:39,020 --> 01:11:40,440
Holy shit, dude.

2531
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:43,080
Uh, we can't make it.

2532
01:11:43,520 --> 01:11:48,100
Selvyn might be coming, but I don't think he will be able to.

2533
01:11:49,500 --> 01:11:53,980
Which, hey, still a vibe, because we get through the turns quicker as well.

2534
01:11:55,040 --> 01:11:55,860
So we're doing it.

2535
01:11:55,980 --> 01:11:56,840
We're doing it, guys.

2536
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:03,320
Um... Wait, wait, are we playing like, uh, Tabletop Monopoly, or the game...

2537
01:12:03,320 --> 01:12:04,980
or the Steam Monopoly?

2538
01:12:05,620 --> 01:12:06,580
Uh, Monopoly Plus?

2539
01:12:07,420 --> 01:12:10,480
Okay, because we might need to do Parsec for that, then.

2540
01:12:10,640 --> 01:12:11,340
What does that mean?

2541
01:12:12,640 --> 01:12:16,500
Uh, Monopoly Plus has terrible online features.

2542
01:12:18,180 --> 01:12:19,840
So you have to do like...

2543
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:20,940
Or like Steam Controller.

2544
01:12:22,060 --> 01:12:23,760
Oh, wait, is this one we usually play?

2545
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:24,940
Or Remote Play.

2546
01:12:25,420 --> 01:12:26,080
Wait, really?

2547
01:12:26,300 --> 01:12:26,540
Yeah, Remote Play.

2548
01:12:26,820 --> 01:12:34,880
Yeah, yeah, because like, Monopoly Plus, like, Ubisoft is really bad with online features, and if you use their online multiplayer, you get kicked out.

2549
01:12:35,140 --> 01:12:35,800
Those are the two things.

2550
01:12:36,180 --> 01:12:38,480
Wait, really?

2551
01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:40,880
Me and Psy can play this one loads, and it's always worked fine.

2552
01:12:41,080 --> 01:12:41,640
Wait, really?

2553
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:42,340
Yeah, yeah.

2554
01:12:43,040 --> 01:12:45,220
Okay, maybe they just hate VTubers.

2555
01:12:45,480 --> 01:12:48,240
Because that's what happens every time.

2556
01:12:48,860 --> 01:12:52,880
We can give it a go, and if it goes kind of cooked, then we can just figure it out.

2557
01:12:52,980 --> 01:12:55,460
But yeah, I think whenever we've done it, it's usually okay.

2558
01:12:55,620 --> 01:12:57,100
But, I don't know, we'll just see.

2559
01:12:57,360 --> 01:12:58,040
We'll check it out.

2560
01:12:59,120 --> 01:13:00,420
I can invite you guys whenever.

2561
01:13:00,720 --> 01:13:03,020
Huw, you know I have you on Ubisoft, right?

2562
01:13:03,140 --> 01:13:03,960
Or maybe I don't, actually.

2563
01:13:04,700 --> 01:13:05,020
Ubisoft?

2564
01:13:05,220 --> 01:13:05,600
I don't know.

2565
01:13:05,620 --> 01:13:09,580
I don't think so, but holy frick, this thing has taken like 50 years to load.

2566
01:13:09,700 --> 01:13:15,580
Also, the intro music, when you load in it, is so loud, just it blew off my eardrums, also my chats.

2567
01:13:15,700 --> 01:13:17,580
It was so freaking loud.

2568
01:13:19,300 --> 01:13:19,740
Um...

2569
01:13:19,740 --> 01:13:21,980
Yeah, I always mute every Steam game because it's so loud.

2570
01:13:21,980 --> 01:13:23,420
Yeah, holy Christ.

2571
01:13:23,620 --> 01:13:25,200
It was, uh, that was a whole thing.

2572
01:13:26,040 --> 01:13:28,860
Um, whenever me and Psy play Monopoly, it gets kind of hectic.

2573
01:13:28,920 --> 01:13:30,160
I'm gonna give you the pre-warning.

2574
01:13:32,100 --> 01:13:33,800
We kind of just grief each other repeatedly.

2575
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:35,320
Um...

2576
01:13:35,620 --> 01:13:36,960
That's basically Monopoly, then.

2577
01:13:37,760 --> 01:13:39,080
That's basically Monopoly.

2578
01:13:39,380 --> 01:13:40,960
You don't want the other to win.

2579
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:42,420
Oh, God.

2580
01:13:43,700 --> 01:13:44,400
Don't you get it?

2581
01:13:44,460 --> 01:13:46,260
I can't believe we won in Twitch Rivals, man.

2582
01:13:46,520 --> 01:13:47,560
We got the squad!

2583
01:13:47,920 --> 01:13:49,800
That was so RNG.

2584
01:13:49,980 --> 01:13:50,560
That's so...

2585
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:53,640
You guys all got, like, Alien.

2586
01:13:53,660 --> 01:13:54,240
Alien, dude.

2587
01:13:54,880 --> 01:13:55,960
Oh, God.

2588
01:13:56,380 --> 01:13:58,260
That RNG was fucking crazy.

2589
01:13:58,280 --> 01:14:01,000
The fact that we were lost as well up until then is crazy.

2590
01:14:01,200 --> 01:14:02,920
Like, that's insane, right?

2591
01:14:03,640 --> 01:14:04,160
Yeah.

2592
01:14:04,160 --> 01:14:06,000
Um, let me do this.

2593
01:14:06,840 --> 01:14:07,640
Hard bit.

2594
01:14:07,820 --> 01:14:09,320
Where's my Ubisoft password?

2595
01:14:09,480 --> 01:14:09,940
Holy shit.

2596
01:14:09,980 --> 01:14:10,400
Oh, my God.

2597
01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:11,560
I do the same thing.

2598
01:14:11,720 --> 01:14:13,960
Every time I play this game, I always forget I have to log in.

2599
01:14:14,360 --> 01:14:15,860
Every single time.

2600
01:14:15,980 --> 01:14:19,440
It's stupid that you have to log in via Ubisoft to play a Steam game.

2601
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:19,940
Yeah.

2602
01:14:20,360 --> 01:14:22,280
Dude, that's... I'm a Zangief main.

2603
01:14:22,340 --> 01:14:24,760
I just... I destroyed that guy so badly.

2604
01:14:24,840 --> 01:14:27,240
You destroyed a modern Cammy that's actually...

2605
01:14:27,240 --> 01:14:31,780
These Cammy players think they can play the game and I just push one button.

2606
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:32,460
It's so funny.

2607
01:14:33,440 --> 01:14:35,240
Alright, I'm opening up about Monopoly.

2608
01:14:35,380 --> 01:14:36,660
I forgot my password.

2609
01:14:37,360 --> 01:14:38,400
Yeah, I don't remember.

2610
01:14:39,860 --> 01:14:40,260
Guys!

2611
01:14:40,960 --> 01:14:41,360
Guys!

2612
01:14:43,100 --> 01:14:43,820
Here, fine.

2613
01:14:43,900 --> 01:14:49,380
I'm gonna hit the recover password and I'm gonna enter every single email address that I think I'm gonna be using.

2614
01:14:51,540 --> 01:14:51,940
Um...

2615
01:14:54,440 --> 01:14:56,980
Chat, would you like a good Monopoly song?

2616
01:14:57,960 --> 01:14:59,240
I don't know what a good Monopoly song is.

2617
01:14:59,280 --> 01:15:00,060
You know, we're gonna go with Roller of Music.

2618
01:15:00,660 --> 01:15:02,440
Chat, do we want Monopoly music or do we want... do we want...

2619
01:15:02,460 --> 01:15:02,920
our music?

2620
01:15:04,420 --> 01:15:05,580
I think maybe we go with our music.

2621
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:07,920
I think it's more of a vibe than the Monopoly soundtrack.

2622
01:15:08,680 --> 01:15:09,000
Brazil!

2623
01:15:11,140 --> 01:15:13,940
Chat, if he is able to show up we can obviously write it back or do whatever.

2624
01:15:14,100 --> 01:15:17,840
I don't know whether he's gonna be... if he's able to or not, but, um...

2625
01:15:18,320 --> 01:15:20,280
I also don't wanna, uh, spam him.

2626
01:15:20,340 --> 01:15:22,400
So, we'll... if so, it's available.

2627
01:15:22,600 --> 01:15:22,920
Dope.

2628
01:15:22,920 --> 01:15:23,820
If not, it's also okay.

2629
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:24,280
You know?

2630
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:27,640
As we will rock you, that's gonna be the vibe, dude.

2631
01:15:28,280 --> 01:15:29,280
Oh my god, chat.

2632
01:15:29,320 --> 01:15:31,100
You know what song I've been loving recently, dude?

2633
01:15:32,460 --> 01:15:32,720
Yes, chat.

2634
01:15:35,480 --> 01:15:38,900
Last night, we let the liquor talk.

2635
01:15:43,420 --> 01:15:45,960
We let the liquor talk.

2636
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:48,980
Members in it's in it's...

2637
01:15:50,820 --> 01:15:52,040
Dude, dude, dude.

2638
01:15:53,080 --> 01:15:55,340
Bro, this is a banger, dude.

2639
01:15:56,540 --> 01:15:59,780
Dude, this song goes crazed.

2640
01:16:00,820 --> 01:16:03,480
Dude, this song goes... You mean, ew.

2641
01:16:03,760 --> 01:16:04,740
Are you joking?

2642
01:16:05,640 --> 01:16:07,660
Bro, this song goes crazy, bro.

2643
01:16:08,960 --> 01:16:10,360
It goes crazy.

2644
01:16:11,680 --> 01:16:12,540
Who is that?

2645
01:16:12,640 --> 01:16:13,060
Who is what?

2646
01:16:13,280 --> 01:16:13,320
Alright, I'm ready.

2647
01:16:13,400 --> 01:16:14,260
Send out the invite.

2648
01:16:16,120 --> 01:16:19,140
Let me invite.

2649
01:16:21,120 --> 01:16:21,600
Inviting.

2650
01:16:22,880 --> 01:16:23,840
Come on.

2651
01:16:24,200 --> 01:16:26,280
What happened to your old name?

2652
01:16:26,580 --> 01:16:34,700
Oh, I changed it because I did a sponsor with Tina and I didn't think having big dong Allen was probably a Yeah, you can change your name?

2653
01:16:35,020 --> 01:16:36,140
Yeah, you can change your name.

2654
01:16:36,260 --> 01:16:37,220
That's a very good reason to change it, yeah.

2655
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:40,020
Wait, he's a controversial singer?

2656
01:16:40,220 --> 01:16:40,540
Wait, is he?

2657
01:16:40,780 --> 01:16:41,900
Oh, I didn't know that.

2658
01:16:41,960 --> 01:16:43,380
If he is, in which case...

2659
01:16:44,520 --> 01:16:49,020
Dude, now that you've converted me to Zangief, like, I love the game now.

2660
01:16:49,100 --> 01:16:49,820
It's actually fun.

2661
01:16:50,060 --> 01:16:51,280
Yeah, it's more fun, right?

2662
01:16:51,380 --> 01:16:52,120
Playing as Zangief?

2663
01:16:52,200 --> 01:16:52,600
Yeah.

2664
01:16:52,940 --> 01:16:53,860
I'm enjoying it.

2665
01:16:53,900 --> 01:16:57,920
The funny thing is I just went against another Cammy who had better combos than I had.

2666
01:16:57,920 --> 01:17:00,340
And I just destroyed him with one button.

2667
01:17:00,760 --> 01:17:03,960
I just kept pushing one button and they lost.

2668
01:17:04,720 --> 01:17:06,420
Yeah, because you don't have to try as much.

2669
01:17:07,080 --> 01:17:07,480
Nice.

2670
01:17:08,080 --> 01:17:11,680
It's just... Zangief is literally just reactions.

2671
01:17:12,280 --> 01:17:15,780
You can just play off of reactions and not... But I have terrible reactions.

2672
01:17:16,300 --> 01:17:17,820
He's so satisfying to play.

2673
01:17:18,080 --> 01:17:19,760
You know, when you hit the ground it goes crazy.

2674
01:17:20,440 --> 01:17:22,300
Yeah, when you hit it, it's like insane.

2675
01:17:22,300 --> 01:17:24,460
I just can't believe it took me this long to realize.

2676
01:17:26,360 --> 01:17:27,760
It just took me this long.

2677
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:29,860
No, you should carry on with Cammy.

2678
01:17:30,280 --> 01:17:31,960
No, I want to win.

2679
01:17:32,300 --> 01:17:33,260
I like winning.

2680
01:17:33,460 --> 01:17:34,640
I want to be last.

2681
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:40,180
You know how hard I have to try to wait.

2682
01:17:40,920 --> 01:17:41,600
Wait, Lili.

2683
01:17:42,480 --> 01:17:42,920
Huh?

2684
01:17:43,880 --> 01:17:45,260
Wait, are you fighting in...

2685
01:17:45,800 --> 01:17:49,040
Wait, is this Lili as in Lili Pichu?

2686
01:17:49,180 --> 01:17:49,620
Lili?

2687
01:17:50,520 --> 01:17:51,160
Wait a minute.

2688
01:17:51,300 --> 01:17:51,800
No, no, no.

2689
01:17:51,820 --> 01:17:53,300
It can't be Lili Pichu, can it?

2690
01:17:53,760 --> 01:17:54,380
Is it?

2691
01:17:55,300 --> 01:17:57,140
I mean, I'm pulling it up.

2692
01:17:57,180 --> 01:18:00,020
By the way, if it is Lili... Yeah, yeah, it is her.

2693
01:18:00,120 --> 01:18:01,620
Dude, I think it's actually her.

2694
01:18:01,880 --> 01:18:03,200
You randomly matched?

2695
01:18:03,740 --> 01:18:05,480
Lili is the worst counter match.

2696
01:18:06,160 --> 01:18:08,700
Wait, she knows the tech, bro?

2697
01:18:08,900 --> 01:18:11,380
Lili is the worst counter matchup for Zangief, by the way.

2698
01:18:11,720 --> 01:18:13,380
She's like the hardest to play against.

2699
01:18:13,760 --> 01:18:14,480
Oh, dude.

2700
01:18:14,560 --> 01:18:15,940
Who does Lili play?

2701
01:18:16,120 --> 01:18:17,160
No, my new main.

2702
01:18:18,220 --> 01:18:27,480
Lili is playing Lili and because Justin Wan told us, told me that this character is like the pure counter match of Zangief.

2703
01:18:27,980 --> 01:18:28,760
Wait, really?

2704
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:29,820
Oh, shit.

2705
01:18:31,180 --> 01:18:35,480
Because she can hit you from afar, basically.

2706
01:18:35,680 --> 01:18:37,780
Dude, one more of those grabs, I still win, though.

2707
01:18:38,200 --> 01:18:39,580
Yeah, you still have to hit that grab.

2708
01:18:41,380 --> 01:18:42,400
He's gotta hit it.

2709
01:18:43,240 --> 01:18:45,300
Oh, dude.

2710
01:18:45,640 --> 01:18:47,060
If he's available, yeah.

2711
01:18:47,060 --> 01:18:48,600
If not, it's also completely okay.

2712
01:18:49,580 --> 01:18:52,660
By the way, chat, I know right now...

2713
01:18:53,980 --> 01:19:01,420
Just to let you guys know, Pico part 2 on Thursday, so far confirmed, is me, Selbit, Nicewig, and Sykuno.

2714
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:02,240
I've asked...

2715
01:19:03,560 --> 01:19:08,140
I've asked a bunch of people, so we're gonna see the full squad, but so far, we got half the lobby.

2716
01:19:08,320 --> 01:19:11,440
But Selbit's gonna be playing on Thursday for that as well, so that's gonna be dope as hell.

2717
01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:13,160
It's gonna be awesome, bro.

2718
01:19:13,360 --> 01:19:13,980
It's gonna be awesome.

2719
01:19:14,540 --> 01:19:15,880
Because it's a plus.

2720
01:19:17,440 --> 01:19:19,360
So, you know how she does that twisty thing?

2721
01:19:19,640 --> 01:19:20,960
You have to make sure she does that.

2722
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:21,900
I'm just playing again.

2723
01:19:22,580 --> 01:19:25,520
I keep pushing my counter button instead of my, uh...

2724
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:26,000
Triangle?

2725
01:19:26,500 --> 01:19:29,920
Do you guys have any Ubisoft names?

2726
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:31,120
So I can add you guys?

2727
01:19:31,560 --> 01:19:33,580
Oh, I already have you added, man.

2728
01:19:33,940 --> 01:19:34,660
I don't have...

2729
01:19:34,660 --> 01:19:37,160
One button combo?

2730
01:19:38,200 --> 01:19:39,540
I think it has to be Ubisoft.

2731
01:19:39,820 --> 01:19:40,660
Which is the problem.

2732
01:19:40,780 --> 01:19:42,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2733
01:19:42,720 --> 01:19:44,640
Oh, how do I add you on Ubisoft?

2734
01:19:45,780 --> 01:19:47,740
So basically you press...

2735
01:19:48,320 --> 01:19:49,140
The club?

2736
01:19:49,520 --> 01:19:50,440
Okay, I found it.

2737
01:19:50,460 --> 01:19:51,200
What's your name, Elm?

2738
01:19:51,900 --> 01:19:52,360
Barnacle Bing.

2739
01:19:54,040 --> 01:19:54,700
Barnacle...

2740
01:19:55,480 --> 01:19:57,020
Hey, Ubisoft Club.

2741
01:19:57,260 --> 01:19:57,540
Okay.

2742
01:19:58,400 --> 01:19:59,340
Where's mine?

2743
01:20:00,060 --> 01:20:02,280
Oh, mine's Real Female Doki.

2744
01:20:03,140 --> 01:20:03,800
Real...

2745
01:20:05,060 --> 01:20:05,720
Female...

2746
01:20:06,760 --> 01:20:07,420
Doki.

2747
01:20:07,660 --> 01:20:08,200
Doki.

2748
01:20:08,540 --> 01:20:09,880
Okay, I added you.

2749
01:20:12,060 --> 01:20:13,240
There you go.

2750
01:20:13,650 --> 01:20:16,220
There's one, and then friend request done.

2751
01:20:16,380 --> 01:20:16,760
Oh, I got it.

2752
01:20:17,200 --> 01:20:17,860
Boom!

2753
01:20:18,960 --> 01:20:21,260
And then I'll make a new lobby.

2754
01:20:21,900 --> 01:20:22,900
Cause I'm just gonna time out.

2755
01:20:25,060 --> 01:20:25,520
Um...

2756
01:20:26,660 --> 01:20:28,760
He's getting his ass kicked right now.

2757
01:20:29,040 --> 01:20:29,920
Create a game.

2758
01:20:31,220 --> 01:20:31,680
Uh...

2759
01:20:32,640 --> 01:20:33,100
Private...

2760
01:20:34,580 --> 01:20:36,180
Private, private, private, private, private.

2761
01:20:37,620 --> 01:20:38,080
Uh...

2762
01:20:38,080 --> 01:20:38,920
Living board.

2763
01:20:38,920 --> 01:20:43,600
I think if Sykuna wins his first match, he plays against Lily's team.

2764
01:20:44,380 --> 01:20:45,080
Oh, is it?

2765
01:20:45,100 --> 01:20:45,680
Oh wait, do you guys...

2766
01:20:45,680 --> 01:20:46,520
Do you have like squads?

2767
01:20:46,600 --> 01:20:47,620
Is that how it works?

2768
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:49,320
Yeah, yeah, we have a tournament tomorrow.

2769
01:20:49,320 --> 01:20:51,340
We have like the final tournament date tomorrow.

2770
01:20:51,700 --> 01:20:52,180
Oh...

2771
01:20:52,980 --> 01:20:54,000
That's why he's...

2772
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:55,880
That's why he's fucking practicing.

2773
01:20:56,880 --> 01:20:57,360
Oh...

2774
01:20:57,360 --> 01:21:00,400
Like a week ago, maybe like a week and a half ago.

2775
01:21:00,520 --> 01:21:02,900
First time he played Street Fighter, I was...

2776
01:21:02,900 --> 01:21:04,480
Is it Dao Sim or something like that?

2777
01:21:04,620 --> 01:21:10,920
I beat his ass for an hour, and then I think he got so scarred for it because that's never happened in any game.

2778
01:21:11,100 --> 01:21:14,580
And then he just came back and now just kicks my ass every time.

2779
01:21:15,400 --> 01:21:16,560
It's so annoying.

2780
01:21:16,560 --> 01:21:18,300
Do you play Tekken, Doki?

2781
01:21:19,420 --> 01:21:20,460
Yeah, I play Tekken.

2782
01:21:20,460 --> 01:21:21,760
I did the Tekken tournament.

2783
01:21:22,060 --> 01:21:22,500
Oh shit, nice.

2784
01:21:22,600 --> 01:21:24,080
Yeah, we've been playing Tekken.

2785
01:21:24,200 --> 01:21:25,640
But even like that, I'm like...

2786
01:21:25,640 --> 01:21:30,300
I didn't realize, because I just started playing ranked on that, but I play Jhin.

2787
01:21:30,340 --> 01:21:31,340
Pretty much only play Jhin.

2788
01:21:31,860 --> 01:21:32,260
And...

2789
01:21:33,860 --> 01:21:37,820
When you're like low rank, how you can just spam one move and you just win.

2790
01:21:38,100 --> 01:21:39,400
Oh, that is so true.

2791
01:21:39,740 --> 01:21:40,880
It's just a knowledge check.

2792
01:21:41,160 --> 01:21:43,080
Well, I would low kick and just...

2793
01:21:43,080 --> 01:21:46,480
In the super low ranks, people just don't check low kicks.

2794
01:21:46,580 --> 01:21:51,320
So I would just do up, low, low, up, up, low, low, low, low, up, low, and just do that repeatedly.

2795
01:21:51,740 --> 01:21:52,500
I think that's just fighting games.

2796
01:21:52,640 --> 01:21:53,980
People just don't block lows.

2797
01:21:54,200 --> 01:21:54,660
No, they just don't.

2798
01:21:55,600 --> 01:21:58,400
I think it's because it doesn't look...

2799
01:21:58,400 --> 01:22:00,660
Honestly, I think it's because the move also just doesn't look cool.

2800
01:22:00,800 --> 01:22:02,900
It's just like a boring kick, right?

2801
01:22:03,100 --> 01:22:03,920
But they always like...

2802
01:22:03,920 --> 01:22:05,160
Especially in Tekken, they hit.

2803
01:22:05,900 --> 01:22:08,360
Low kicks actually do damage if you hit them a lot.

2804
01:22:09,240 --> 01:22:10,840
Yeah, yeah, I agree, yeah.

2805
01:22:11,460 --> 01:22:13,060
I abuse a lot of the low kicks.

2806
01:22:13,080 --> 01:22:14,660
Because people just don't block it.

2807
01:22:15,660 --> 01:22:19,280
I think if I learned one other move, I actually will be unbeatable.

2808
01:22:20,440 --> 01:22:25,000
All I do is push the one button grab and the DI, and that's all I've done.

2809
01:22:26,020 --> 01:22:28,420
See, if you hit your DI, just press triangle.

2810
01:22:29,220 --> 01:22:30,340
Yeah, that's all I do.

2811
01:22:30,460 --> 01:22:31,300
Yeah, that's like the best part.

2812
01:22:31,500 --> 01:22:33,920
You should press OD triangle.

2813
01:22:35,140 --> 01:22:36,000
Overdrive triangle.

2814
01:22:36,600 --> 01:22:38,420
Overdrive triangle gives you more damage.

2815
01:22:38,660 --> 01:22:40,240
I mean, I've done that with TOS.

2816
01:22:40,700 --> 01:22:42,180
It works.

2817
01:22:43,540 --> 01:22:44,500
Is Doki...

2818
01:22:45,060 --> 01:22:45,960
Is she Doki?

2819
01:22:46,140 --> 01:22:47,980
Is she good at fighting games?

2820
01:22:48,340 --> 01:22:50,100
From the way she talks, I'm assuming she is.

2821
01:22:51,300 --> 01:22:52,000
She's cracked.

2822
01:22:52,360 --> 01:22:53,960
Dude, I want to watch...

2823
01:22:53,960 --> 01:22:54,760
You know what's crazy?

2824
01:22:55,140 --> 01:23:03,500
The first time I ever met Doki, or even actually become familiar with her, was during the Twitch Rivals.

2825
01:23:03,500 --> 01:23:04,960
was during the Twitch Rivals.

2826
01:23:05,200 --> 01:23:07,700
But I immediately loved her energy.

2827
01:23:07,920 --> 01:23:12,520
By the moment I joined and she just had this crazy, crazy good energy, I was like, I want to play with her.

2828
01:23:14,220 --> 01:23:16,140
I love people with energy.

2829
01:23:16,520 --> 01:23:19,320
The moment she started talking, I was like, I love her.

2830
01:23:19,800 --> 01:23:22,340
She has good fucking energy and she's funny.

2831
01:23:22,700 --> 01:23:24,040
I was like, I want to invite her to shit.

2832
01:23:24,100 --> 01:23:24,420
She's fun.

2833
01:23:25,320 --> 01:23:28,160
I think I'm going to invite her to a bunch of shit.

2834
01:23:28,500 --> 01:23:29,080
She's great.

2835
01:23:29,220 --> 01:23:30,260
I really like her.

2836
01:23:30,400 --> 01:23:31,640
She's really, really cool.

2837
01:23:32,960 --> 01:23:33,320
Check.

2838
01:23:34,620 --> 01:23:36,440
Oh yeah, the back rolling grab.

2839
01:23:36,680 --> 01:23:38,100
Yep, I got that one.

2840
01:23:39,400 --> 01:23:41,000
It's just mostly all grabs.

2841
01:23:41,880 --> 01:23:45,740
And then like, forward circle.

2842
01:23:45,740 --> 01:23:46,240
Dude, she's great.

2843
01:23:46,320 --> 01:23:47,240
Honestly, she's great.

2844
01:23:47,460 --> 01:23:48,400
For real, for real.

2845
01:23:48,660 --> 01:23:49,200
She's awesome.

2846
01:23:49,460 --> 01:23:50,160
She's really, really cool.

2847
01:23:50,700 --> 01:23:52,500
I said before guys, I like...

2848
01:23:52,500 --> 01:23:53,800
I like...

2849
01:23:57,220 --> 01:24:00,360
I like it when people come in with just like fucking energy.

2850
01:24:00,940 --> 01:24:04,800
When we did the Twitch Rivals thing and she just starts roasting me because some of the shit...

2851
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:07,020
Bear in mind, we haven't really even interacted at that point.

2852
01:24:08,100 --> 01:24:09,640
We just go in and I'm just like being an idiot.

2853
01:24:09,740 --> 01:24:10,640
She just roasts me for it.

2854
01:24:10,700 --> 01:24:11,800
I was like, I like that.

2855
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:15,980
Because she's like coming at me with just like insult after insult after insult after insult.

2856
01:24:16,040 --> 01:24:17,020
And I'm like, yeah, I fuck with that.

2857
01:24:17,940 --> 01:24:18,660
That's like...

2858
01:24:19,400 --> 01:24:21,620
I like people I can bounce off.

2859
01:24:21,740 --> 01:24:23,860
That's why I'm definitely going to invite her to more shit.

2860
01:24:23,860 --> 01:24:24,660
She's funny as fuck, dude.

2861
01:24:26,440 --> 01:24:27,440
Oh, we've been here.

2862
01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:28,580
We're waiting for you, motherfucker.

2863
01:24:29,220 --> 01:24:31,140
I told you, motherfucker.

2864
01:24:31,380 --> 01:24:34,580
I literally told you three times.

2865
01:24:34,680 --> 01:24:36,760
I told you three times.

2866
01:24:38,100 --> 01:24:38,480
I'm angry at you.

2867
01:24:39,780 --> 01:24:41,400
I was enjoying the Zangief.

2868
01:24:41,880 --> 01:24:43,480
I was enjoying the Zangief.

2869
01:24:44,180 --> 01:24:45,200
It's just so good.

2870
01:24:45,420 --> 01:24:49,480
I genuinely think if I spend more than 15 seconds...

2871
01:24:49,480 --> 01:24:57,680
So I went into the combo trial, literally spent 15 seconds to learn that pushing triangle does a move and then I just went straight into games after that.

2872
01:24:57,780 --> 01:24:58,520
I've just been winning.

2873
01:24:59,720 --> 01:25:02,280
Dude, I took a round off Lillian, almost beat her.

2874
01:25:02,680 --> 01:25:07,180
She's been laughing against Zangief for like a very long time.

2875
01:25:08,100 --> 01:25:09,880
I had 15 seconds of practice.

2876
01:25:10,100 --> 01:25:14,500
Yeah, and Lillian is like the counter pick to Zangief too, so that's why.

2877
01:25:18,560 --> 01:25:20,140
Did you get the invite, bro?

2878
01:25:23,470 --> 01:25:23,910
Sorry?

2879
01:25:24,530 --> 01:25:26,090
You got like 15 seconds.

2880
01:25:26,910 --> 01:25:27,890
Wait, he's in the game?

2881
01:25:27,970 --> 01:25:28,430
I don't see him.

2882
01:25:28,870 --> 01:25:31,890
No, he's in the lot, like the main menu.

2883
01:25:33,050 --> 01:25:34,630
Let me remake it.

2884
01:25:34,670 --> 01:25:35,790
It was just going to time out.

2885
01:25:35,790 --> 01:25:38,290
Let me make her...

2886
01:25:38,290 --> 01:25:39,690
I'm a Zangief main now.

2887
01:25:39,770 --> 01:25:40,990
He's a Zangief main now.

2888
01:25:41,530 --> 01:25:48,450
And Lillian is the hardest matchup and I almost beat her with only 15 seconds of practice, only knowing one singular button.

2889
01:25:48,810 --> 01:25:49,690
That's crazy.

2890
01:25:49,970 --> 01:25:50,150
That's so fucked.

2891
01:25:51,130 --> 01:25:54,970
She's been laughing against Zangief for like several hours every day.

2892
01:25:55,810 --> 01:26:00,130
Why train for hours when you can push one button after 15 seconds?

2893
01:26:00,830 --> 01:26:04,170
Dude, if I train for 15 more minutes it's a GG.

2894
01:26:04,470 --> 01:26:05,610
Oh god.

2895
01:26:06,710 --> 01:26:07,730
What do I want to be?

2896
01:26:07,810 --> 01:26:08,930
I'm going to be this thing.

2897
01:26:12,060 --> 01:26:13,480
I'm being this thing.

2898
01:26:13,780 --> 01:26:14,580
I'm a dog.

2899
01:26:15,580 --> 01:26:18,440
Doki, we do like fighting game lobbies.

2900
01:26:18,460 --> 01:26:18,920
You should join.

2901
01:26:19,080 --> 01:26:23,420
I didn't know you were like an OG of the Tekken Street Fighter.

2902
01:26:23,560 --> 01:26:23,600
Oh, I am not.

2903
01:26:24,260 --> 01:26:30,000
I literally learned fighting games because of the Seijan slam shit that Tycoon and I are invited to.

2904
01:26:30,020 --> 01:26:30,760
And now you're hooked.

2905
01:26:31,060 --> 01:26:32,360
And now you're hooked.

2906
01:26:33,140 --> 01:26:34,380
I invite you by the way, Huynh.

2907
01:26:34,840 --> 01:26:38,380
I mean, I like it more now that I'm a Zangief main.

2908
01:26:39,880 --> 01:26:41,580
It's a lot more fun now.

2909
01:26:41,620 --> 01:26:44,980
Before I'm pushing like a hundred buttons to do no damage.

2910
01:26:45,260 --> 01:26:47,020
Now, I walk at them.

2911
01:26:47,240 --> 01:26:54,140
Your character is all about being fast and trying to do as many attacks as possible.

2912
01:26:54,800 --> 01:26:58,140
And then I push one button and I equal your attack.

2913
01:26:58,340 --> 01:26:59,360
Your 20 attacks.

2914
01:26:59,440 --> 01:27:05,240
I have to do some crazy combo that I practiced for like a week for to do less damage than one button.

2915
01:27:05,320 --> 01:27:06,560
Yeah, but it looks cool though.

2916
01:27:06,720 --> 01:27:08,720
It looks cool though, man.

2917
01:27:08,840 --> 01:27:10,060
You know, maybe go for the Star Wars.

2918
01:27:10,120 --> 01:27:11,100
Let me be the Zangief.

2919
01:27:11,200 --> 01:27:12,200
Give me the Zangief.

2920
01:27:13,480 --> 01:27:16,700
This is the first time I felt like I've been having fun playing Street Fighter.

2921
01:27:16,840 --> 01:27:17,320
I ain't gonna lie.

2922
01:27:19,040 --> 01:27:20,780
It was a struggle till then.

2923
01:27:20,980 --> 01:27:22,240
And now I'm like, yeah, this is kind of fun.

2924
01:27:22,240 --> 01:27:23,200
There's Dao Sim, bro.

2925
01:27:24,060 --> 01:27:26,080
Dao Sim main with his stretchy legs.

2926
01:27:27,120 --> 01:27:28,400
That guy went crazy, bro.

2927
01:27:28,480 --> 01:27:30,540
Yeah, those were the old days, but now I'm a Zangief-er.

2928
01:27:31,160 --> 01:27:32,340
I'm a Zangief-er, man.

2929
01:27:32,340 --> 01:27:34,600
Okay, here we go, guys.

2930
01:27:34,900 --> 01:27:36,900
Time for some Monopoly.

2931
01:27:38,320 --> 01:27:38,920
Yippee!

2932
01:27:40,120 --> 01:27:40,420
Roll!

2933
01:27:40,420 --> 01:27:41,680
Give me something big.

2934
01:27:41,740 --> 01:27:42,360
Big juicer.

2935
01:27:42,540 --> 01:27:43,520
Okay, okay.

2936
01:27:43,520 --> 01:27:44,500
Nothing too shabby.

2937
01:27:44,540 --> 01:27:45,700
Nothing too shabby there.

2938
01:27:46,340 --> 01:27:47,460
It's your turn.

2939
01:27:48,240 --> 01:27:49,380
Alright, my turn.

2940
01:27:51,560 --> 01:27:52,160
Roll!

2941
01:27:53,980 --> 01:27:55,780
Nothing too shabby.

2942
01:27:55,980 --> 01:27:56,560
Oh!

2943
01:27:56,800 --> 01:27:58,800
At least we know who's gonna be last.

2944
01:27:58,900 --> 01:27:59,500
Dokia!

2945
01:28:02,380 --> 01:28:03,560
You're messed up!

2946
01:28:04,420 --> 01:28:05,360
Is it my turn?

2947
01:28:05,940 --> 01:28:06,380
Eleven?

2948
01:28:07,200 --> 01:28:08,380
Yeah, she got freaking eleven.

2949
01:28:08,600 --> 01:28:10,240
Yeah, you can get ten or twelve.

2950
01:28:11,400 --> 01:28:11,840
Oh!

2951
01:28:11,840 --> 01:28:13,980
Eight, I feel like, isn't even that bad.

2952
01:28:14,160 --> 01:28:14,700
No, it's not.

2953
01:28:14,860 --> 01:28:15,800
Just everyone's been rolling high.

2954
01:28:17,240 --> 01:28:20,040
I'm gonna think I'm rolling a two here.

2955
01:28:20,280 --> 01:28:21,400
Nah, I hear you and I believe in you.

2956
01:28:21,460 --> 01:28:21,900
I believe in you.

2957
01:28:21,980 --> 01:28:23,060
I'm feeling it.

2958
01:28:23,200 --> 01:28:23,900
No way.

2959
01:28:23,920 --> 01:28:24,520
I'm last.

2960
01:28:25,020 --> 01:28:26,200
It's all over for me.

2961
01:28:26,340 --> 01:28:26,900
It's all over.

2962
01:28:27,120 --> 01:28:27,480
What?

2963
01:28:27,560 --> 01:28:28,200
No way!

2964
01:28:28,260 --> 01:28:28,620
Nine?

2965
01:28:29,500 --> 01:28:29,780
I'm last.

2966
01:28:29,780 --> 01:28:30,320
I'm last.

2967
01:28:30,740 --> 01:28:32,500
None of us even rolled low.

2968
01:28:32,660 --> 01:28:33,020
It's crazy.

2969
01:28:33,700 --> 01:28:38,820
Dokia, I've been told that apparently last time you played Monopoly, you just, in capital letters, destroyed everybody.

2970
01:28:39,380 --> 01:28:40,260
Oh, yeah.

2971
01:28:40,300 --> 01:28:40,780
Yeah.

2972
01:28:40,860 --> 01:28:41,220
Oh.

2973
01:28:41,220 --> 01:28:41,560
Oh.

2974
01:28:42,160 --> 01:28:42,920
Oh, shit.

2975
01:28:43,320 --> 01:28:44,120
She's a pro.

2976
01:28:44,320 --> 01:28:45,420
She's a damn pro.

2977
01:28:45,780 --> 01:28:45,940
Yeah.

2978
01:28:48,300 --> 01:28:49,160
Oh, wait.

2979
01:28:49,180 --> 01:28:49,780
She got the rip.

2980
01:28:50,500 --> 01:28:51,440
What do I get?

2981
01:28:51,700 --> 01:28:52,420
What is that?

2982
01:28:52,500 --> 01:28:52,660
Ooh!

2983
01:28:52,980 --> 01:28:53,560
A blue.

2984
01:28:53,800 --> 01:28:55,220
Hell yeah, I'm gonna purchase that.

2985
01:28:55,480 --> 01:28:55,940
Oh, God.

2986
01:28:56,800 --> 01:28:57,440
Okay, okay.

2987
01:28:57,540 --> 01:28:59,720
As long as I get a couple of reds along the way, I'll be fine.

2988
01:29:00,580 --> 01:29:02,140
A couple of reds along the way.

2989
01:29:02,180 --> 01:29:02,840
Hey, I'm an orange.

2990
01:29:04,180 --> 01:29:05,400
Well, wait.

2991
01:29:05,560 --> 01:29:06,420
But what if I get orange?

2992
01:29:06,940 --> 01:29:08,640
You wanna be willing to trade with me, man?

2993
01:29:08,920 --> 01:29:09,240
Okay.

2994
01:29:09,400 --> 01:29:10,260
Yeah, I'll trade for it.

2995
01:29:10,280 --> 01:29:12,940
I don't think me and you have ever done a successful trade before, by the way.

2996
01:29:12,980 --> 01:29:14,940
I think we've just inted each other the whole time.

2997
01:29:15,420 --> 01:29:17,680
Since we're both geef players, we should work together.

2998
01:29:18,580 --> 01:29:18,920
Oh, yeah, for sure.

2999
01:29:18,920 --> 01:29:19,760
And make sure Ellen loses.

3000
01:29:19,880 --> 01:29:21,080
But I'm also a geef player!

3001
01:29:21,880 --> 01:29:22,760
He's a fake geef player.

3002
01:29:23,260 --> 01:29:24,760
No, no, he's a fake geef player.

3003
01:29:24,880 --> 01:29:26,740
He doesn't know the special grab button.

3004
01:29:26,780 --> 01:29:27,160
Yeah, he doesn't understand.

3005
01:29:27,460 --> 01:29:29,200
He doesn't know the triangle button.

3006
01:29:29,720 --> 01:29:33,000
He's a keyboard geef player.

3007
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:36,080
He's pushing buttons instead of triangle.

3008
01:29:36,360 --> 01:29:37,880
I wanna form an alliance with you.

3009
01:29:37,920 --> 01:29:38,520
Me and you.

3010
01:29:39,140 --> 01:29:39,640
An alliance?

3011
01:29:40,160 --> 01:29:42,300
Hey, you wanna work with Sykuna and I?

3012
01:29:42,480 --> 01:29:42,960
Dude!

3013
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:43,980
Yeah, I'm down.

3014
01:29:44,420 --> 01:29:45,080
You're fake.

3015
01:29:45,560 --> 01:29:45,900
You're fake.

3016
01:29:47,180 --> 01:29:48,140
That's crazy.

3017
01:29:49,580 --> 01:29:52,340
Oh, thanks for your Hey, Doki.

3018
01:29:52,340 --> 01:29:54,020
Hey, Doki.

3019
01:29:56,140 --> 01:29:57,860
Do you wanna form an alliance with me and Sykuna?

3020
01:29:58,120 --> 01:29:58,140
No.

3021
01:30:01,580 --> 01:30:02,840
Sykuna, do you want Ellen to lose?

3022
01:30:03,820 --> 01:30:04,540
I mean...

3023
01:30:04,540 --> 01:30:07,040
Yeah, but I want him to think he has a chance to win.

3024
01:30:07,100 --> 01:30:10,960
What the f- It's not fun if they know they're gonna lose.

3025
01:30:10,960 --> 01:30:12,080
That's what he does on Street Fighter.

3026
01:30:12,440 --> 01:30:18,340
What he'll do on Street Fighter is he'll give me a round and then fucking annihilate me for like three games after.

3027
01:30:18,600 --> 01:30:20,160
He does it every time.

3028
01:30:20,860 --> 01:30:22,040
He's gotta play Geese, man.

3029
01:30:22,580 --> 01:30:23,320
Oh, seven.

3030
01:30:23,480 --> 01:30:24,740
That puts me on Community, right?

3031
01:30:25,040 --> 01:30:25,440
Yeah.

3032
01:30:26,040 --> 01:30:27,120
Yeah, I think so.

3033
01:30:27,360 --> 01:30:28,720
Maybe you get to go to Broadway.

3034
01:30:30,740 --> 01:30:32,700
But now you've got no properties, man.

3035
01:30:32,800 --> 01:30:33,100
Zero.

3036
01:30:34,500 --> 01:30:34,900
No!

3037
01:30:35,920 --> 01:30:37,340
I'm going back to saying Geese.

3038
01:30:37,880 --> 01:30:39,680
I'm going back to saying Geese.

3039
01:30:41,140 --> 01:30:41,820
Oh, man.

3040
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:43,680
Give me my shmoney.

3041
01:30:43,880 --> 01:30:45,540
Give me my shmoney, baby.

3042
01:30:45,880 --> 01:30:46,280
Okay.

3043
01:30:46,280 --> 01:30:46,680
Nice.

3044
01:30:48,040 --> 01:30:49,520
Ooh, where do I go here?

3045
01:30:50,520 --> 01:30:51,320
Classic six.

3046
01:30:51,720 --> 01:30:52,900
One of the pinks, maybe?

3047
01:30:53,700 --> 01:30:56,220
Wait, you're just collecting properties, bro.

3048
01:30:56,380 --> 01:30:56,440
Oh, hey!

3049
01:30:56,440 --> 01:30:56,520
I got pink!

3050
01:30:57,160 --> 01:30:58,680
You're just collecting these properties.

3051
01:30:58,740 --> 01:30:59,160
This is BS.

3052
01:30:59,240 --> 01:31:00,680
I'm just gonna collect the properties.

3053
01:31:01,600 --> 01:31:04,160
I hope you guys get six as well.

3054
01:31:04,180 --> 01:31:04,920
Huynh, I hope you get six.

3055
01:31:06,380 --> 01:31:07,760
I thought that was part of your allies.

3056
01:31:07,940 --> 01:31:08,780
Huynh, you see that?

3057
01:31:08,860 --> 01:31:11,760
At the first moment of weakness, she wants to attack you.

3058
01:31:12,780 --> 01:31:13,820
I know mine.

3059
01:31:13,820 --> 01:31:14,680
I know mine.

3060
01:31:14,720 --> 01:31:15,740
This is taxes.

3061
01:31:16,340 --> 01:31:18,640
I'm just encouraging her to pay taxes.

3062
01:31:19,040 --> 01:31:19,860
Oh, wow.

3063
01:31:20,740 --> 01:31:22,040
Did you get $100?

3064
01:31:22,740 --> 01:31:26,740
In the last place, I've been giving my money away.

3065
01:31:27,080 --> 01:31:28,580
I mean, what else could go wrong for me?

3066
01:31:28,820 --> 01:31:30,240
4Corp, you're such a troll.

3067
01:31:31,740 --> 01:31:33,520
Hey, technically, you...

3068
01:31:33,520 --> 01:31:39,160
Technically, I know you have zero property, but at least you're not the most poor.

3069
01:31:39,540 --> 01:31:40,740
Who is the most...

3070
01:31:40,740 --> 01:31:42,160
Oh, hey, thanks for...

3071
01:31:43,920 --> 01:31:47,120
Honestly, I'm here to funnel her.

3072
01:31:47,340 --> 01:31:50,260
Dude, how is Doki winning in every single game?

3073
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:52,000
She's my offshore bank account.

3074
01:31:52,320 --> 01:31:53,260
It's like you're gonna funnel me.

3075
01:31:53,300 --> 01:31:54,420
It's like you're gonna funnel me, brother.

3076
01:31:54,820 --> 01:31:56,180
They're filming an alliance.

3077
01:31:56,580 --> 01:31:58,940
The boys gotta stick together here, brother.

3078
01:31:58,940 --> 01:32:00,700
This doesn't land me on you.

3079
01:32:01,640 --> 01:32:02,220
Does it?

3080
01:32:02,620 --> 01:32:05,500
Is this the railroad or is this I lose money?

3081
01:32:05,800 --> 01:32:06,300
Oh, it's the railroad.

3082
01:32:08,400 --> 01:32:10,160
I think I'll buy this one.

3083
01:32:10,820 --> 01:32:11,300
Okay.

3084
01:32:11,600 --> 01:32:12,220
Do it.

3085
01:32:14,620 --> 01:32:16,180
It's a train station.

3086
01:32:16,300 --> 01:32:17,020
Railroads are not...

3087
01:32:17,020 --> 01:32:18,620
Are they good?

3088
01:32:18,740 --> 01:32:21,240
They're good if you have all of them.

3089
01:32:22,600 --> 01:32:24,980
Because if you have all of them, then it's like...

3090
01:32:24,980 --> 01:32:27,220
Because that's how I won Monopoly.

3091
01:32:28,140 --> 01:32:30,460
Wait, you like played this on the regular?

3092
01:32:30,760 --> 01:32:36,000
No, because the last time I played Monopoly, I got all the railroads just by traveling around.

3093
01:32:36,320 --> 01:32:37,400
She's a damn pro.

3094
01:32:38,320 --> 01:32:40,140
Everybody just kept landing on it.

3095
01:32:41,220 --> 01:32:42,680
She's a damn pro.

3096
01:32:42,680 --> 01:32:44,620
That's how you win in Monopoly.

3097
01:32:44,860 --> 01:32:46,140
It's such a big disadvantage.

3098
01:32:46,460 --> 01:32:47,820
I can't buy any of these things.

3099
01:32:48,200 --> 01:32:52,080
Please, for the love of God, just give me a property.

3100
01:32:52,240 --> 01:32:52,620
I need one.

3101
01:32:53,180 --> 01:32:55,420
If you get the railroad, you're gonna give it to me, right?

3102
01:32:55,880 --> 01:32:56,800
Oh yeah, 100%.

3103
01:32:56,800 --> 01:32:57,000
You?

3104
01:32:57,160 --> 01:32:57,700
My guy?

3105
01:32:57,900 --> 01:32:58,160
Of course.

3106
01:32:58,560 --> 01:32:59,180
Look at that.

3107
01:32:59,600 --> 01:33:01,160
What does Ellen get in return?

3108
01:33:01,820 --> 01:33:03,400
He gets the other thing.

3109
01:33:03,740 --> 01:33:06,260
What's the other thing?

3110
01:33:06,540 --> 01:33:07,860
Yeah, what's the other thing?

3111
01:33:08,020 --> 01:33:09,980
What was it called?

3112
01:33:10,920 --> 01:33:12,160
What color did you like again?

3113
01:33:12,200 --> 01:33:12,420
Blue.

3114
01:33:12,520 --> 01:33:14,080
I like dark blue, actually.

3115
01:33:15,260 --> 01:33:16,820
There's no way I can get a dark blue.

3116
01:33:16,960 --> 01:33:18,160
Why not?

3117
01:33:20,220 --> 01:33:22,560
You give me the dark blue, I'll give you the railway station.

3118
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:23,040
I'll tell you what.

3119
01:33:23,040 --> 01:33:25,180
You give me the railroad now, so I can start making money.

3120
01:33:25,520 --> 01:33:27,240
And I'll give you the dark blue when I get it.

3121
01:33:27,240 --> 01:33:27,940
Dude, you're a liar.

3122
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:29,140
You're not gonna give it to me.

3123
01:33:29,300 --> 01:33:29,960
You won't.

3124
01:33:30,860 --> 01:33:32,000
I'm good on my word.

3125
01:33:32,180 --> 01:33:34,320
You always betray me.

3126
01:33:34,360 --> 01:33:35,340
What do you mean?

3127
01:33:36,140 --> 01:33:38,660
I'll give it to you if I land on it.

3128
01:33:38,700 --> 01:33:39,260
Then I'll give it to you.

3129
01:33:39,980 --> 01:33:40,660
It's gonna be different, Ellen.

3130
01:33:40,780 --> 01:33:42,540
Today's the one day he's gonna work with me.

3131
01:33:43,440 --> 01:33:45,080
I'm gonna make the money back, bro.

3132
01:33:45,140 --> 01:33:46,020
You give me this thing.

3133
01:33:46,460 --> 01:33:47,980
I'm gonna make the money back and pay you back.

3134
01:33:48,160 --> 01:33:54,240
After playing Risk with this guy for about six months straight every day, let me tell you, he doesn't pay it back.

3135
01:33:54,840 --> 01:33:55,020
He wants it now.

3136
01:33:55,020 --> 01:33:56,500
I put that deal up, bro.

3137
01:33:56,700 --> 01:33:58,200
I put that deal up, okay?

3138
01:33:58,900 --> 01:34:00,020
I put up that deal.

3139
01:34:01,580 --> 01:34:02,920
Here, I give you one dollar.

3140
01:34:03,540 --> 01:34:04,240
No, no, no, bitch.

3141
01:34:04,700 --> 01:34:06,260
I want two hundred bucks.

3142
01:34:06,360 --> 01:34:08,440
I want two hundred bucks as a sign of good faith.

3143
01:34:09,980 --> 01:34:10,900
You're not gonna give it to me.

3144
01:34:11,160 --> 01:34:12,780
You won't give it to me.

3145
01:34:13,480 --> 01:34:14,540
Okay, fine.

3146
01:34:14,540 --> 01:34:15,960
I'll give you two hundred to break it even.

3147
01:34:16,360 --> 01:34:18,860
And then when I give you the blue one, you give me the two hundred back.

3148
01:34:18,940 --> 01:34:19,880
Yeah, it's a loan.

3149
01:34:21,740 --> 01:34:22,200
That's fine.

3150
01:34:22,440 --> 01:34:25,540
We call it a loan, and when I get the blue one and give it to you, you pay me back.

3151
01:34:25,780 --> 01:34:27,280
We both win.

3152
01:34:29,580 --> 01:34:32,680
You give me this railroad, I make the money back with the railroad.

3153
01:34:32,860 --> 01:34:33,920
One more condition.

3154
01:34:35,540 --> 01:34:37,680
You say that I'm a better geith than you.

3155
01:34:38,860 --> 01:34:39,180
What?

3156
01:34:39,980 --> 01:34:41,680
I thought you didn't want me to be a liar, man.

3157
01:34:41,840 --> 01:34:41,940
What?

3158
01:34:43,760 --> 01:34:44,480
You dickhead.

3159
01:34:46,500 --> 01:34:48,660
I reject that deal after you said that.

3160
01:34:48,700 --> 01:34:49,780
That's how you know I'm honest, dude.

3161
01:34:49,780 --> 01:34:51,280
That was a test.

3162
01:34:51,420 --> 01:34:53,840
That was a test to see if I was honest, and I passed.

3163
01:34:54,440 --> 01:34:56,940
That was a test to see if I was honest, and I think I passed that.

3164
01:34:57,020 --> 01:34:57,380
Just saying.

3165
01:34:57,620 --> 01:34:59,900
And I'm gonna make the money back with this railroad.

3166
01:34:59,900 --> 01:35:00,700
I'm telling you, man.

3167
01:35:00,700 --> 01:35:05,260
You give me this loan now, I double my money instantly, and then bam.

3168
01:35:05,780 --> 01:35:06,480
Railroad shit.

3169
01:35:06,480 --> 01:35:08,420
That was a huge test.

3170
01:35:08,920 --> 01:35:09,280
Orange.

3171
01:35:09,620 --> 01:35:10,820
No, I want the orange.

3172
01:35:10,920 --> 01:35:11,620
I don't want the blue.

3173
01:35:11,680 --> 01:35:12,020
Give me the orange.

3174
01:35:12,740 --> 01:35:13,280
No, no.

3175
01:35:13,280 --> 01:35:13,700
Give me the orange.

3176
01:35:13,740 --> 01:35:14,300
Give me the orange.

3177
01:35:15,660 --> 01:35:16,020
You.

3178
01:35:17,800 --> 01:35:19,060
You said blue only.

3179
01:35:20,180 --> 01:35:21,340
That is insane.

3180
01:35:21,900 --> 01:35:22,840
Deal's locked in.

3181
01:35:23,580 --> 01:35:25,820
I told you not to accept the deal, LM.

3182
01:35:25,980 --> 01:35:26,780
I told you.

3183
01:35:26,880 --> 01:35:28,420
But you don't even have the dollar blue yet.

3184
01:35:28,480 --> 01:35:29,180
You don't even have it.

3185
01:35:29,900 --> 01:35:32,580
If I did though, you know.

3186
01:35:32,580 --> 01:35:34,300
What is this?

3187
01:35:34,380 --> 01:35:35,380
Oh, another orange.

3188
01:35:35,380 --> 01:35:35,460
Let's go.

3189
01:35:35,460 --> 01:35:37,080
Dude, Doki is just getting everything.

3190
01:35:37,520 --> 01:35:38,960
Doki is getting everything.

3191
01:35:40,340 --> 01:35:42,920
If she gets my railroad, it's gonna be over.

3192
01:35:42,940 --> 01:35:46,060
If she gets my dollar blue, then Sykuno's gonna go, oh, that's a dollar blue, I owe you.

3193
01:35:46,140 --> 01:35:47,340
I know what he's gonna do.

3194
01:35:47,380 --> 01:35:48,560
I know what this guy's gonna do.

3195
01:35:48,880 --> 01:35:51,720
I think I just need to copy Doki in every single game.

3196
01:35:51,900 --> 01:35:52,200
Here we go.

3197
01:35:52,280 --> 01:35:52,520
Please.

3198
01:35:52,700 --> 01:35:53,020
Please.

3199
01:35:54,320 --> 01:35:54,680
Wait.

3200
01:35:54,680 --> 01:35:55,460
There's no way I go to jail.

3201
01:35:55,640 --> 01:35:56,580
There's no way I go to jail.

3202
01:35:56,600 --> 01:35:58,000
I'm moving up Apex after this, man.

3203
01:35:59,180 --> 01:36:00,200
You're going to jail?

3204
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:01,360
Oh.

3205
01:36:01,640 --> 01:36:02,000
Bro.

3206
01:36:02,580 --> 01:36:03,160
That's a bad thing.

3207
01:36:03,220 --> 01:36:06,200
He forgot to bring his cash.

3208
01:36:06,200 --> 01:36:07,400
Isn't that like super bad right now?

3209
01:36:07,400 --> 01:36:09,700
I have nothing.

3210
01:36:10,140 --> 01:36:10,540
Nothing.

3211
01:36:11,460 --> 01:36:12,920
Yeah, but you could have bought stuff.

3212
01:36:12,940 --> 01:36:13,820
Have you been tax evading her?

3213
01:36:14,360 --> 01:36:14,760
Maybe.

3214
01:36:14,760 --> 01:36:16,800
Maybe a little, but you know, it's just a smidge.

3215
01:36:16,800 --> 01:36:17,600
Have you done your taxes?

3216
01:36:17,900 --> 01:36:18,260
No.

3217
01:36:20,020 --> 01:36:21,340
We got live on stream.

3218
01:36:21,560 --> 01:36:21,840
We got live on stream.

3219
01:36:24,600 --> 01:36:26,620
Oh, she got me in squatting.

3220
01:36:28,220 --> 01:36:29,020
Oh, she got me in squatting.

3221
01:36:29,060 --> 01:36:29,460
Waterworks.

3222
01:36:29,640 --> 01:36:31,060
Dude, is this one even worth buying?

3223
01:36:33,360 --> 01:36:35,100
I'm going to just buy it just for fun.

3224
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:36,900
I knew it was worth it.

3225
01:36:36,900 --> 01:36:39,460
Honestly, I feel like, you know, they're kind of cheap as well.

3226
01:36:39,760 --> 01:36:41,140
Better than nothing, I guess.

3227
01:36:41,500 --> 01:36:43,500
Okay, I need to land an orange.

3228
01:36:43,540 --> 01:36:46,040
Wait, if I come back and I steal one, this could still be fine.

3229
01:36:46,920 --> 01:36:47,700
This could still be fine.

3230
01:36:48,460 --> 01:36:49,100
Dude, wait.

3231
01:36:49,280 --> 01:36:50,000
I don't know.

3232
01:36:52,060 --> 01:36:53,280
Is that Railway?

3233
01:36:53,340 --> 01:36:53,840
Is that Railway?

3234
01:36:53,840 --> 01:36:54,320
No shot.

3235
01:36:54,540 --> 01:36:55,580
Is that another Railway?

3236
01:36:55,800 --> 01:36:56,460
Oh, it's yellow.

3237
01:36:56,520 --> 01:36:58,480
Oh, it's not unknown yellow too.

3238
01:36:59,140 --> 01:36:59,540
No way.

3239
01:36:59,540 --> 01:37:02,220
I'm going to sell this yellow for the top, top dollar.

3240
01:37:02,400 --> 01:37:03,120
What do you want to do?

3241
01:37:04,260 --> 01:37:05,100
This is what he does.

3242
01:37:05,100 --> 01:37:07,620
I feel like each of us owns at least one color.

3243
01:37:09,240 --> 01:37:10,600
Well, yeah, that's true.

3244
01:37:10,760 --> 01:37:12,380
Yeah, each of us owns one of the colors.

3245
01:37:12,540 --> 01:37:15,740
I want to point out, by the way, he said well because he's looked at mine and gone, his one's pathetic.

3246
01:37:15,960 --> 01:37:17,080
That's why he went well.

3247
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:19,560
That's the...

3248
01:37:19,560 --> 01:37:21,220
Tell me that isn't true.

3249
01:37:21,280 --> 01:37:22,320
Tell me that isn't true.

3250
01:37:22,560 --> 01:37:23,380
You're just paranoid.

3251
01:37:23,380 --> 01:37:23,620
See?

3252
01:37:23,880 --> 01:37:24,280
See?

3253
01:37:25,140 --> 01:37:25,920
He's paranoid.

3254
01:37:25,920 --> 01:37:27,180
What did he do to you?

3255
01:37:28,440 --> 01:37:28,800
Everything.

3256
01:37:28,800 --> 01:37:29,160
Everything.

3257
01:37:29,720 --> 01:37:30,640
What did he do to you?

3258
01:37:30,840 --> 01:37:31,860
Why are you so paranoid?

3259
01:37:32,740 --> 01:37:33,100
Tell him he's paranoid.

3260
01:37:33,860 --> 01:37:34,860
I know him.

3261
01:37:35,340 --> 01:37:36,120
I know him.

3262
01:37:37,140 --> 01:37:38,180
Tell him how he is.

3263
01:37:38,280 --> 01:37:38,660
Tell him.

3264
01:37:41,180 --> 01:37:41,900
It's like...

3265
01:37:42,420 --> 01:37:43,200
Get me out of here.

3266
01:37:43,320 --> 01:37:46,440
It's like somebody's going to die and then you're like, I bet it's like who knows.

3267
01:37:46,500 --> 01:37:47,580
I bet he's the one that did it.

3268
01:37:48,020 --> 01:37:48,580
Yeah, see?

3269
01:37:49,780 --> 01:37:50,340
It's true.

3270
01:37:50,460 --> 01:37:51,040
It's true.

3271
01:37:51,880 --> 01:37:52,240
Please.

3272
01:37:52,440 --> 01:37:52,800
Please.

3273
01:37:52,940 --> 01:37:53,960
Did you pay $50 to get out?

3274
01:37:54,020 --> 01:37:54,540
Yes, I did.

3275
01:37:54,580 --> 01:37:55,280
I won this orange.

3276
01:37:55,920 --> 01:37:56,540
Why did you pay $50?

3277
01:37:56,760 --> 01:37:57,880
Because I won the orange.

3278
01:37:58,080 --> 01:37:58,340
Look.

3279
01:37:58,500 --> 01:37:59,740
Free orange.

3280
01:38:00,200 --> 01:38:01,480
I'm losing my fucking mind.

3281
01:38:01,560 --> 01:38:02,420
You have to pay the price.

3282
01:38:04,260 --> 01:38:05,300
Helping out a friend.

3283
01:38:05,500 --> 01:38:08,420
I thought you guys were comrades.

3284
01:38:08,940 --> 01:38:10,800
Let's not forget that I gave you $200.

3285
01:38:10,860 --> 01:38:13,560
So technically, you're just giving me back the $200.

3286
01:38:14,440 --> 01:38:15,640
But you're going to give me that dollar.

3287
01:38:15,800 --> 01:38:17,440
You're going to jail.

3288
01:38:17,560 --> 01:38:18,560
Dude, that's prison though, isn't it?

3289
01:38:18,720 --> 01:38:19,400
But you go to jail.

3290
01:38:20,700 --> 01:38:22,480
You still get a roll again.

3291
01:38:23,640 --> 01:38:25,660
I also evaded some taxes.

3292
01:38:25,920 --> 01:38:27,740
Oh, hewn.

3293
01:38:29,140 --> 01:38:30,480
It was a bad argument.

3294
01:38:31,100 --> 01:38:31,820
Oh, I guess not.

3295
01:38:32,340 --> 01:38:34,880
Dude, if I go to jail here, I'm going to mold.

3296
01:38:35,380 --> 01:38:35,900
I'm free.

3297
01:38:36,060 --> 01:38:36,460
I'm free.

3298
01:38:36,560 --> 01:38:37,040
Oh, you're free.

3299
01:38:37,600 --> 01:38:38,040
Wait a minute.

3300
01:38:38,080 --> 01:38:39,920
This is the green one I think you just bought.

3301
01:38:40,120 --> 01:38:40,960
Did I just buy that?

3302
01:38:41,660 --> 01:38:42,360
Oh, my God.

3303
01:38:42,440 --> 01:38:43,060
Oh, hey, thanks.

3304
01:38:43,240 --> 01:38:44,440
Thanks for paying my mortgage.

3305
01:38:45,620 --> 01:38:46,380
Big money.

3306
01:38:46,540 --> 01:38:48,080
Big money.

3307
01:38:49,720 --> 01:38:51,320
Your turn starts now.

3308
01:38:51,740 --> 01:38:52,600
Yeah, you can't.

3309
01:38:52,620 --> 01:38:52,900
You can't.

3310
01:38:53,300 --> 01:38:53,920
Dude, please.

3311
01:38:54,180 --> 01:38:54,560
Yes.

3312
01:38:54,800 --> 01:38:55,140
Wait a minute.

3313
01:38:55,920 --> 01:38:56,200
No, wait.

3314
01:38:56,200 --> 01:38:56,660
No, Dougie.

3315
01:38:56,660 --> 01:38:57,240
No, no, no, wait, wait, wait.

3316
01:38:57,340 --> 01:38:58,760
There is a God in this world.

3317
01:38:58,820 --> 01:38:59,560
Oh, my God.

3318
01:38:59,560 --> 01:39:00,260
Thank Christ.

3319
01:39:00,440 --> 01:39:02,140
Oh, my God.

3320
01:39:02,200 --> 01:39:02,700
Thank Christ.

3321
01:39:02,960 --> 01:39:04,440
I almost got it.

3322
01:39:04,680 --> 01:39:07,920
Dude, I was about to go scorched earth.

3323
01:39:07,940 --> 01:39:08,060
I hope you also get taxed.

3324
01:39:08,080 --> 01:39:09,180
I swear to God.

3325
01:39:09,400 --> 01:39:10,060
Wait, why?

3326
01:39:10,360 --> 01:39:11,000
I'm poor.

3327
01:39:11,280 --> 01:39:12,700
I'm in last place right now.

3328
01:39:13,520 --> 01:39:14,660
Dude, I was about to go scorched earth.

3329
01:39:14,660 --> 01:39:15,700
What happened to Zangiefers?

3330
01:39:15,700 --> 01:39:17,440
Why don't Zangiefers stick together?

3331
01:39:17,740 --> 01:39:19,240
Yeah, we're sticking together.

3332
01:39:19,280 --> 01:39:21,200
We both have to pay our taxes together.

3333
01:39:21,480 --> 01:39:22,980
You already paid enough for the rolls of us.

3334
01:39:23,640 --> 01:39:24,300
Wait, no.

3335
01:39:24,640 --> 01:39:26,580
Did you say you want to follow my footsteps?

3336
01:39:26,900 --> 01:39:28,040
I'm probably... Wait, yes.

3337
01:39:28,040 --> 01:39:29,400
Except for that tax thing.

3338
01:39:29,600 --> 01:39:30,500
Please, please.

3339
01:39:31,300 --> 01:39:32,580
Dude, I'm going to fucking...

3340
01:39:32,580 --> 01:39:33,440
I'm actually going to mold.

3341
01:39:34,080 --> 01:39:34,920
This is perfect.

3342
01:39:34,980 --> 01:39:35,740
What do you mean?

3343
01:39:35,800 --> 01:39:36,820
This is good for you.

3344
01:39:37,280 --> 01:39:38,100
Oh, it's free parking.

3345
01:39:38,180 --> 01:39:39,940
This is so good for you.

3346
01:39:40,540 --> 01:39:44,820
No, no, no.

3347
01:39:44,820 --> 01:39:45,520
I want the orange.

3348
01:39:45,520 --> 01:39:48,040
I want the orange now.

3349
01:39:48,300 --> 01:39:50,680
You give me the orange and I give you the dark blue.

3350
01:39:50,840 --> 01:39:51,820
I changed my mind.

3351
01:39:51,880 --> 01:39:52,220
I changed my mind.

3352
01:39:52,260 --> 01:39:52,600
No, it's okay.

3353
01:39:52,980 --> 01:39:53,760
Let's go back on the deal.

3354
01:39:53,780 --> 01:39:54,900
You can't just change your mind.

3355
01:39:55,060 --> 01:39:56,080
It's a signed contract.

3356
01:39:56,340 --> 01:39:59,200
Do I keep paying money to people?

3357
01:40:01,520 --> 01:40:01,960
Bro.

3358
01:40:02,520 --> 01:40:03,980
Dude, Ellen, we had a deal already.

3359
01:40:04,200 --> 01:40:06,600
Yeah, you can't just back out on the deal.

3360
01:40:07,060 --> 01:40:08,900
I get the oranges, you get the blue.

3361
01:40:08,900 --> 01:40:10,220
No, that wasn't the deal.

3362
01:40:10,280 --> 01:40:11,800
You said you wanted the railway stations.

3363
01:40:12,360 --> 01:40:13,640
Yeah, railways and oranges.

3364
01:40:13,700 --> 01:40:15,640
That isn't what you said.

3365
01:40:16,340 --> 01:40:17,140
No, I agree.

3366
01:40:17,280 --> 01:40:18,560
I'm pretty sure you said that.

3367
01:40:18,660 --> 01:40:19,860
You said orange and railroads.

3368
01:40:19,860 --> 01:40:21,980
I've always said the oranges are my thing.

3369
01:40:22,020 --> 01:40:22,940
They're my thing, man.

3370
01:40:23,340 --> 01:40:24,680
No, he definitely said that.

3371
01:40:24,740 --> 01:40:25,020
I remember.

3372
01:40:26,460 --> 01:40:27,920
Donkey, you're my alliance.

3373
01:40:27,980 --> 01:40:28,400
Remember that?

3374
01:40:28,440 --> 01:40:28,660
Remember?

3375
01:40:28,780 --> 01:40:30,000
Remember we formed that bond?

3376
01:40:30,400 --> 01:40:31,500
I don't remember that.

3377
01:40:31,520 --> 01:40:32,120
I don't remember that.

3378
01:40:32,140 --> 01:40:32,980
You're a keyboard thief.

3379
01:40:33,100 --> 01:40:33,980
I don't know what that is.

3380
01:40:35,240 --> 01:40:36,060
God, dude.

3381
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:38,360
Holy...

3382
01:40:39,240 --> 01:40:40,640
Am I going to buy this one?

3383
01:40:41,440 --> 01:40:42,320
They're being mean to me.

3384
01:40:43,060 --> 01:40:44,240
Dude, I'm auctioning this.

3385
01:40:44,560 --> 01:40:45,480
They're being mean to me.

3386
01:40:45,940 --> 01:40:48,040
What are they being mean to you?

3387
01:40:48,520 --> 01:40:49,240
I don't know.

3388
01:40:49,360 --> 01:40:50,380
I think it's because it's deserved.

3389
01:40:50,600 --> 01:40:51,820
You know it's deserved at this point, I think.

3390
01:40:52,540 --> 01:40:54,640
I think you have like...

3391
01:40:54,640 --> 01:40:59,240
You know how in games you have a hidden trait on birth?

3392
01:40:59,460 --> 01:41:02,580
Yours is like you taunt people and then they...

3393
01:41:04,180 --> 01:41:05,460
They just have to make fun of you.

3394
01:41:05,460 --> 01:41:06,760
Oh, I think you got a bid, June.

3395
01:41:06,940 --> 01:41:07,300
You got a bid.

3396
01:41:08,100 --> 01:41:10,740
Either withdraw or bid for a brown.

3397
01:41:12,620 --> 01:41:13,060
Uh...

3398
01:41:14,520 --> 01:41:16,920
I mean, the price is $22 right now.

3399
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:20,080
Which means you can buy it and mortgage it back for $30.

3400
01:41:20,400 --> 01:41:22,360
You literally can't lose money at this point.

3401
01:41:22,840 --> 01:41:23,720
Yeah, that's true.

3402
01:41:23,780 --> 01:41:25,160
I'm going to bid a dollar over.

3403
01:41:25,320 --> 01:41:25,780
Oh, yeah.

3404
01:41:25,860 --> 01:41:27,560
Oh, I'll bid a dollar.

3405
01:41:29,500 --> 01:41:30,800
Not all just bid a dollar.

3406
01:41:30,800 --> 01:41:34,180
If you bid $100, they won't grab it.

3407
01:41:34,280 --> 01:41:34,860
Why would you?

3408
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:35,360
$100?

3409
01:41:37,540 --> 01:41:39,760
You're going to pay $135 for this garbage?

3410
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:41,260
No, no, I'm out.

3411
01:41:41,340 --> 01:41:42,360
We're in this garbage.

3412
01:41:44,380 --> 01:41:45,340
$135 for...

3413
01:41:45,340 --> 01:41:46,540
That's like a shit.

3414
01:41:46,860 --> 01:41:47,540
No way.

3415
01:41:47,540 --> 01:41:48,980
You bought like a little tent.

3416
01:41:50,180 --> 01:41:51,660
I'm backing out of this.

3417
01:41:51,800 --> 01:41:53,340
Let me tell you that one.

3418
01:41:53,340 --> 01:41:56,940
You never know how many times you guys might land on this thing.

3419
01:41:56,980 --> 01:41:57,860
True, true.

3420
01:41:58,080 --> 01:41:59,260
What if it wins the game?

3421
01:41:59,700 --> 01:42:00,720
You might regret it.

3422
01:42:02,340 --> 01:42:04,560
A hotel only is $250.

3423
01:42:05,240 --> 01:42:06,140
A little hotel.

3424
01:42:06,500 --> 01:42:09,240
That $250 is going to go a long way.

3425
01:42:09,300 --> 01:42:09,780
Oh, my God.

3426
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:11,660
A long way.

3427
01:42:13,060 --> 01:42:14,240
A hotel on it, which is...

3428
01:42:14,240 --> 01:42:15,360
Your time has come.

3429
01:42:16,120 --> 01:42:17,180
I'm usually at $200.

3430
01:42:17,440 --> 01:42:19,920
Do I land on it?

3431
01:42:19,980 --> 01:42:22,080
Wait, you don't land on the other ground.

3432
01:42:22,200 --> 01:42:23,100
There's no shot.

3433
01:42:24,360 --> 01:42:26,820
Dude, that would have been so troll, dude.

3434
01:42:26,900 --> 01:42:27,900
That would have been so troll.

3435
01:42:28,160 --> 01:42:29,680
I can't believe I actually landed.

3436
01:42:30,180 --> 01:42:30,960
Oh, yay!

3437
01:42:31,140 --> 01:42:31,840
I got $10!

3438
01:42:32,520 --> 01:42:33,000
Yeah!

3439
01:42:33,580 --> 01:42:34,140
Let's go!

3440
01:42:34,540 --> 01:42:35,260
Nice, nice.

3441
01:42:35,380 --> 01:42:37,020
That's free money right there.

3442
01:42:37,660 --> 01:42:39,880
Give me something good.

3443
01:42:39,940 --> 01:42:40,380
Give me something good.

3444
01:42:40,920 --> 01:42:42,000
Oh, that's big.

3445
01:42:42,120 --> 01:42:42,620
That's big.

3446
01:42:43,260 --> 01:42:43,620
Please.

3447
01:42:43,640 --> 01:42:43,820
Please.

3448
01:42:43,820 --> 01:42:45,260
Wait, that lands you on...

3449
01:42:45,260 --> 01:42:48,080
Yeah, that's perfect.

3450
01:42:48,240 --> 01:42:48,600
You get a blue.

3451
01:42:48,620 --> 01:42:49,360
Oh, you got the blue!

3452
01:42:49,560 --> 01:42:51,500
I told you you would get a dark blue.

3453
01:42:51,760 --> 01:42:53,780
No, not squares, you dick.

3454
01:42:54,780 --> 01:42:55,720
You got the blue.

3455
01:42:55,860 --> 01:42:58,960
No, you give me the other blue.

3456
01:42:59,160 --> 01:43:00,360
So help me, Syke.

3457
01:43:00,420 --> 01:43:01,700
How am I going to get the other blue?

3458
01:43:01,900 --> 01:43:03,020
You already got one blue.

3459
01:43:04,260 --> 01:43:05,700
I'll tell you what.

3460
01:43:05,720 --> 01:43:07,280
You give me the orange and I promise you...

3461
01:43:07,280 --> 01:43:09,260
No, I don't give you that until you give me the blue.

3462
01:43:09,780 --> 01:43:10,620
What do you mean no?

3463
01:43:10,620 --> 01:43:11,760
We'll do a fair trade.

3464
01:43:11,840 --> 01:43:13,860
If I get the orange now, I can start making money with it.

3465
01:43:14,940 --> 01:43:15,500
Farming me.

3466
01:43:15,880 --> 01:43:17,120
This ain't risk, bro.

3467
01:43:17,260 --> 01:43:18,460
We're not doing that all over again.

3468
01:43:19,560 --> 01:43:20,560
What do you mean?

3469
01:43:20,760 --> 01:43:22,400
You're not farming me for troops.

3470
01:43:22,640 --> 01:43:24,880
You're not farming me for troops again.

3471
01:43:25,920 --> 01:43:27,200
It's as simple as that.

3472
01:43:27,480 --> 01:43:28,520
It's as simple as that.

3473
01:43:28,700 --> 01:43:29,180
Oh, wait.

3474
01:43:29,860 --> 01:43:30,800
You got both of them.

3475
01:43:31,400 --> 01:43:33,020
And you got the waterworks as well, right?

3476
01:43:33,160 --> 01:43:34,260
Dude, that's an auction.

3477
01:43:34,680 --> 01:43:36,580
Dude, I'm auctioning this one, dude.

3478
01:43:37,740 --> 01:43:38,460
Oh, okay.

3479
01:43:38,460 --> 01:43:40,140
I'll do a hundred off the bat.

3480
01:43:40,300 --> 01:43:41,620
Because I know this one's worth a lot.

3481
01:43:42,820 --> 01:43:44,620
Alright, I'll get one dollar in there.

3482
01:43:45,060 --> 01:43:50,520
Huun, by the way, I think with those brands, if you get hotels, they're not actually that expensive to get a fully max...

3483
01:43:50,520 --> 01:43:52,560
I think the houses are super cheap.

3484
01:43:53,020 --> 01:43:55,600
So you can juice them up pretty early if someone lands on them.

3485
01:43:56,400 --> 01:43:57,680
Yeah, well, Suits, you need both.

3486
01:43:58,100 --> 01:43:59,340
Oh, I'm so sorry.

3487
01:43:59,420 --> 01:44:00,920
I did not realize that was me.

3488
01:44:01,200 --> 01:44:01,740
You know what?

3489
01:44:01,820 --> 01:44:02,160
I'm good.

3490
01:44:02,320 --> 01:44:02,820
I'm good.

3491
01:44:03,140 --> 01:44:04,500
Oh, he just backed out immediately.

3492
01:44:04,760 --> 01:44:05,760
Not even a dollar.

3493
01:44:06,580 --> 01:44:07,500
I'm good, you know what I mean?

3494
01:44:07,580 --> 01:44:08,960
I could put a hundred dollars.

3495
01:44:09,140 --> 01:44:10,460
I'll put another ten bucks.

3496
01:44:10,880 --> 01:44:12,220
I'll put one dollar in here.

3497
01:44:12,740 --> 01:44:14,960
If you put a hundred, Sykuna's gonna drop out.

3498
01:44:16,300 --> 01:44:17,340
Dude, he won't.

3499
01:44:18,120 --> 01:44:19,460
I'll drop out for fifty.

3500
01:44:19,660 --> 01:44:22,440
No way, you go 2.32 on that?

3501
01:44:22,600 --> 01:44:23,720
Were you made of money?

3502
01:44:25,240 --> 01:44:25,680
Jesus.

3503
01:44:26,840 --> 01:44:27,660
Huun's in jail.

3504
01:44:27,960 --> 01:44:29,500
Huun's got the trust fund money.

3505
01:44:29,680 --> 01:44:31,240
She's got the trust fund, guys.

3506
01:44:32,420 --> 01:44:32,980
That's all.

3507
01:44:33,180 --> 01:44:36,320
I think she's gonna back down off of this bet.

3508
01:44:36,580 --> 01:44:37,160
You bid?

3509
01:44:37,360 --> 01:44:38,320
She's backing down, bro.

3510
01:44:38,600 --> 01:44:39,440
She's scared.

3511
01:44:39,800 --> 01:44:42,540
Even a hundred dollars, Sykuna will drop out.

3512
01:44:42,640 --> 01:44:43,620
Doki, shut up.

3513
01:44:44,020 --> 01:44:45,120
Actually, I'm going to make...

3514
01:44:45,120 --> 01:44:47,740
Dude, if we let her have this, she's gonna get like the double bonus.

3515
01:44:48,560 --> 01:44:49,000
Right?

3516
01:44:49,220 --> 01:44:50,600
Yeah, she gets ten times.

3517
01:44:50,920 --> 01:44:51,980
It's more than double.

3518
01:44:52,060 --> 01:44:56,580
Well, Sykuna, I'm just letting you know I'm gonna put a hundred in if you don't stop.

3519
01:44:57,500 --> 01:44:58,660
You think I'm afraid?

3520
01:44:59,380 --> 01:45:01,720
Oh, dude, I misclicked.

3521
01:45:01,720 --> 01:45:03,020
He's trying to end you.

3522
01:45:03,020 --> 01:45:05,040
He's trying to end you.

3523
01:45:05,240 --> 01:45:05,920
That's insane.

3524
01:45:06,360 --> 01:45:07,680
No, I was definitely still going.

3525
01:45:07,700 --> 01:45:08,900
That is actually insane.

3526
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:12,420
Oh, wait, you're actually...

3527
01:45:13,040 --> 01:45:14,180
Oh my god.

3528
01:45:14,600 --> 01:45:15,680
Oh my god.

3529
01:45:15,680 --> 01:45:16,860
Dude, that's so troll.

3530
01:45:18,120 --> 01:45:19,300
Dude, Doki, you're insane.

3531
01:45:19,560 --> 01:45:20,680
You're insane for this.

3532
01:45:22,280 --> 01:45:24,000
She has the other one.

3533
01:45:24,080 --> 01:45:25,040
She has the water.

3534
01:45:25,040 --> 01:45:27,660
It is a big benefit.

3535
01:45:29,800 --> 01:45:32,940
Me and Doki are just gonna put one dollar.

3536
01:45:32,940 --> 01:45:33,460
One dollar in.

3537
01:45:36,120 --> 01:45:37,360
What the fuck?

3538
01:45:37,700 --> 01:45:39,360
Someone's gotta back down.

3539
01:45:39,420 --> 01:45:40,560
Dude, what is happening?

3540
01:45:40,820 --> 01:45:42,140
Dude, one of you should just put a hundred.

3541
01:45:42,240 --> 01:45:43,640
What's the cap out?

3542
01:45:43,760 --> 01:45:46,800
I feel like it's not worth it after like three hundred something bucks, right?

3543
01:45:47,120 --> 01:45:48,440
Like, there's no way it's worth it.

3544
01:45:49,100 --> 01:45:49,600
I don't know.

3545
01:45:49,700 --> 01:45:50,560
I think it's worth...

3546
01:45:50,560 --> 01:45:51,780
I think it's worth a lot.

3547
01:45:52,620 --> 01:45:53,980
I'd say like mathematically...

3548
01:45:53,980 --> 01:45:57,180
At least like three hundred or so.

3549
01:45:57,280 --> 01:45:57,940
She'll fall for you.

3550
01:45:59,300 --> 01:46:00,280
She's still going.

3551
01:46:00,760 --> 01:46:02,040
There's actually no way.

3552
01:46:03,680 --> 01:46:05,480
Dude, who's just hitting enter?

3553
01:46:05,560 --> 01:46:07,600
Honestly, I'm just hitting enter.

3554
01:46:07,820 --> 01:46:09,000
She's just hitting enter.

3555
01:46:09,700 --> 01:46:10,920
Doki, hit a hundred.

3556
01:46:11,260 --> 01:46:12,420
Doki, hit a hundred.

3557
01:46:12,960 --> 01:46:13,740
Hit a hundred.

3558
01:46:13,980 --> 01:46:14,880
See if she's spamming enter.

3559
01:46:16,380 --> 01:46:17,540
Hit a hundred, Doki.

3560
01:46:17,560 --> 01:46:18,200
She's button mashing.

3561
01:46:18,340 --> 01:46:20,220
She might be a bit of a street fighter.

3562
01:46:20,280 --> 01:46:20,880
She's mashing.

3563
01:46:20,920 --> 01:46:22,080
You just gotta get her with a...

3564
01:46:22,080 --> 01:46:23,080
Oh, she wasn't mashing.

3565
01:46:23,240 --> 01:46:24,540
She wasn't mashing.

3566
01:46:26,700 --> 01:46:28,040
She's strategic now.

3567
01:46:28,100 --> 01:46:29,580
Dude, this is actually a war.

3568
01:46:29,620 --> 01:46:30,340
That's double.

3569
01:46:33,500 --> 01:46:34,780
306 is crazy.

3570
01:46:35,260 --> 01:46:38,140
I think it's still kind of worth because now she has both.

3571
01:46:39,120 --> 01:46:41,620
Yeah, but then she had to fight for it.

3572
01:46:45,260 --> 01:46:46,660
I'm fine with that.

3573
01:46:51,720 --> 01:46:53,340
God diggity dang, bro.

3574
01:46:53,480 --> 01:46:54,180
God diggity dang.

3575
01:46:55,280 --> 01:46:56,740
I forgot I auctioned that.

3576
01:46:57,180 --> 01:46:58,000
Alright, Elim listen.

3577
01:46:58,560 --> 01:46:59,940
Dude, no, bro.

3578
01:47:00,120 --> 01:47:00,520
No.

3579
01:47:00,700 --> 01:47:01,500
I'll give you the yellow.

3580
01:47:01,580 --> 01:47:02,200
I'll give you the yellow.

3581
01:47:02,200 --> 01:47:02,920
I don't need the yellow!

3582
01:47:03,360 --> 01:47:05,060
But the yellow is worth more money!

3583
01:47:05,380 --> 01:47:08,880
Okay, how about if I get the orange one on the next roll, then we trade for the yellow.

3584
01:47:09,140 --> 01:47:11,780
And if you land on it, and I'll pay you back double.

3585
01:47:12,860 --> 01:47:14,220
Do you really believe him?

3586
01:47:14,240 --> 01:47:16,760
I don't believe a single word this guy says.

3587
01:47:17,400 --> 01:47:20,180
If I lie to you about this, then you never will trust me again.

3588
01:47:20,460 --> 01:47:22,020
And you know I wouldn't do that.

3589
01:47:22,160 --> 01:47:23,960
Do you like your investment over there?

3590
01:47:24,320 --> 01:47:25,820
It's going to be better for both of us.

3591
01:47:26,420 --> 01:47:29,780
No, it's going to be better for you, because then you're going to get...

3592
01:47:29,780 --> 01:47:34,800
Then I'm going to land the railway stations, you're going to have all the orders, then you're going to be like, then you're going to stop following me whenever I get down that lane again.

3593
01:47:35,200 --> 01:47:37,220
No dude, I'll never charge you, I'll never charge you.

3594
01:47:37,220 --> 01:47:38,480
You can't, you don't have an option.

3595
01:47:38,880 --> 01:47:39,680
You're not, what do you mean?

3596
01:47:39,980 --> 01:47:41,540
Just don't pay, just don't pay.

3597
01:47:41,620 --> 01:47:43,640
Just trade me before and I'll pay you back double.

3598
01:47:44,280 --> 01:47:45,420
I'll pay you back double, dude.

3599
01:47:45,620 --> 01:47:46,180
Wait a second.

3600
01:47:46,260 --> 01:47:47,900
I use the money to make some money.

3601
01:47:48,660 --> 01:47:50,320
Do an IOU right now.

3602
01:47:51,200 --> 01:47:52,880
I've been trying to do an I...

3603
01:47:52,880 --> 01:47:55,240
I use the money to make some money, everybody wins.

3604
01:47:55,880 --> 01:47:57,360
I've been trying to do an IOU.

3605
01:47:58,200 --> 01:48:00,300
Even better, Ellum, you don't even have to lift a finger.

3606
01:48:00,840 --> 01:48:01,500
Pay me out.

3607
01:48:01,920 --> 01:48:04,180
Yeah, I'll manage all of it, I'll buy the houses, I'll do everything.

3608
01:48:04,320 --> 01:48:04,940
Pay me out, pay me out.

3609
01:48:05,040 --> 01:48:10,780
All you gotta do is regret not giving me that orange sooner, because I'm going to make us both so much money with it.

3610
01:48:11,400 --> 01:48:15,780
So you're saying you'll give me 50% of your earnings from when you land on that?

3611
01:48:15,780 --> 01:48:17,780
I'll tell you what, I'll tell you what, I'll cut you an even better deal.

3612
01:48:17,880 --> 01:48:24,980
I give you 100% of my earnings until you're paid back, and then 50% in perpetuity in the future.

3613
01:48:25,260 --> 01:48:26,560
Wait, what about the interest rates?

3614
01:48:26,620 --> 01:48:27,540
What's the interest rate?

3615
01:48:27,560 --> 01:48:28,200
What's the interest rate?

3616
01:48:28,280 --> 01:48:28,460
Yeah, yeah.

3617
01:48:29,480 --> 01:48:31,040
50% of future profits?

3618
01:48:31,040 --> 01:48:33,360
Future profit, man, you're getting 50%...

3619
01:48:33,360 --> 01:48:37,000
That's not an interest rate, that's just a... that's a royalty fee.

3620
01:48:37,120 --> 01:48:38,880
Dude, that's better than interest, that's better than interest.

3621
01:48:38,880 --> 01:48:42,200
Yeah, but you have to include interest and royalty in the contract.

3622
01:48:42,420 --> 01:48:44,820
50% is insane already, that's insane!

3623
01:48:46,080 --> 01:48:48,200
You're getting 50% and you don't have to do anything.

3624
01:48:48,200 --> 01:48:53,540
I also want a guarantee, so I need an upfront payment of 400 bucks just in case.

3625
01:48:54,800 --> 01:48:57,220
400, okay, if I get the third one, it's a deal.

3626
01:48:57,260 --> 01:48:58,720
If I get the third one, it's a deal.

3627
01:48:58,760 --> 01:48:59,320
Okay, bye.

3628
01:48:59,320 --> 01:49:01,000
400 is kind of almost all my money.

3629
01:49:01,280 --> 01:49:02,180
400 bucks?

3630
01:49:02,320 --> 01:49:04,100
Yeah, dude, 400 bucks is almost all my money.

3631
01:49:04,100 --> 01:49:07,280
And the 50% and the 50% and the dark blue and we're good.

3632
01:49:08,380 --> 01:49:10,460
And the dark blue if I land on it.

3633
01:49:10,740 --> 01:49:12,420
And the dark blue if I land on it.

3634
01:49:12,540 --> 01:49:20,300
But if someone else lands on it, I want you to try and you need a pitch as to why I should get it.

3635
01:49:20,420 --> 01:49:21,920
I want you to be my lawyer, okay?

3636
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:22,740
You gotta be my lawyer.

3637
01:49:23,320 --> 01:49:26,700
I mean, I'll try, but I can tell you it's probably... they ain't gonna give it to me.

3638
01:49:26,700 --> 01:49:32,040
I mean, you really set the strategy out loud, so, but I'll damn it.

3639
01:49:33,400 --> 01:49:33,920
Wait!

3640
01:49:34,500 --> 01:49:35,020
No!

3641
01:49:36,240 --> 01:49:36,760
You!

3642
01:49:37,180 --> 01:49:39,500
Oh my god, big money, big money.

3643
01:49:39,600 --> 01:49:40,560
Dude, you got the pinks.

3644
01:49:40,560 --> 01:49:42,580
Enjoy that dokey, you big nerd.

3645
01:49:42,880 --> 01:49:44,440
You hand me those oranges, you get the pinks, we take over this town.

3646
01:49:44,640 --> 01:49:46,180
We take over this town.

3647
01:49:47,020 --> 01:49:47,760
It's a win.

3648
01:49:51,440 --> 01:49:52,960
Ooh, okay, okay.

3649
01:49:53,620 --> 01:49:54,160
That's seven.

3650
01:49:54,360 --> 01:49:55,280
Where am I?

3651
01:49:55,280 --> 01:49:56,380
That's it, that's perfect.

3652
01:49:56,600 --> 01:49:58,720
Why do I keep landing on his face?

3653
01:50:00,780 --> 01:50:02,060
Perfect, perfect.

3654
01:50:02,860 --> 01:50:03,960
I needed that money.

3655
01:50:04,380 --> 01:50:06,360
See, LMR, investment's paying off for you.

3656
01:50:06,360 --> 01:50:06,760
No problem.

3657
01:50:06,760 --> 01:50:07,600
Very good.

3658
01:50:07,600 --> 01:50:08,420
That wouldn't have been possible without you.

3659
01:50:08,600 --> 01:50:10,000
Hey, we're business partners now, you know?

3660
01:50:10,080 --> 01:50:10,540
Right?

3661
01:50:10,720 --> 01:50:13,000
Yeah, now give me that orange and we're chillin'.

3662
01:50:14,440 --> 01:50:16,320
Number five on my own railroad.

3663
01:50:16,320 --> 01:50:20,860
I think you're gonna backstab each other the moment they are going to backstab you.

3664
01:50:20,860 --> 01:50:21,720
That's the other thing.

3665
01:50:22,840 --> 01:50:27,380
We have the strongest, I mean, it's just not gonna happen.

3666
01:50:27,540 --> 01:50:32,520
No, we have a strong bond, we have a strong bond, we know, we know now.

3667
01:50:32,780 --> 01:50:34,040
It's not even my own property.

3668
01:50:36,140 --> 01:50:39,040
A classic yellow, a classic yellow, let's go.

3669
01:50:39,180 --> 01:50:41,060
We need somebody to get him a monopoly.

3670
01:50:41,060 --> 01:50:41,600
Nobody has a monopoly.

3671
01:50:41,780 --> 01:50:43,600
Oh, wait, I mean, only Huynh has a monopoly.

3672
01:50:43,620 --> 01:50:44,880
Dude, give me that orange.

3673
01:50:45,100 --> 01:50:45,540
I think all three yellow.

3674
01:50:45,540 --> 01:50:46,200
Give me the other orange.

3675
01:50:46,260 --> 01:50:46,780
Wait a second.

3676
01:50:47,340 --> 01:50:47,740
Wait.

3677
01:50:48,140 --> 01:50:48,880
All three...

3678
01:50:48,880 --> 01:50:49,640
No.

3679
01:50:49,640 --> 01:50:50,660
That's a six, that's communal.

3680
01:50:50,800 --> 01:50:51,240
No.

3681
01:50:51,240 --> 01:50:51,540
There's one more yellow.

3682
01:50:51,660 --> 01:50:51,920
No.

3683
01:50:51,920 --> 01:50:52,620
There's one more yellow.

3684
01:50:53,380 --> 01:50:54,360
There's not even any trade.

3685
01:50:54,360 --> 01:50:55,380
Oh, come on, dude.

3686
01:50:55,680 --> 01:50:56,640
Oh, wow.

3687
01:50:57,060 --> 01:50:57,980
Why, bro?

3688
01:50:58,660 --> 01:50:59,340
That's such...

3689
01:50:59,340 --> 01:50:59,880
We have to pay taxes.

3690
01:51:00,020 --> 01:51:00,460
We have to pay school fees.

3691
01:51:00,460 --> 01:51:01,760
We have to pay school fees.

3692
01:51:01,800 --> 01:51:06,040
You're just losing money from just the community.

3693
01:51:06,300 --> 01:51:06,500
No.

3694
01:51:06,500 --> 01:51:06,860
Wait, this is bad.

3695
01:51:06,960 --> 01:51:07,660
This is bad.

3696
01:51:08,020 --> 01:51:08,720
This is bad.

3697
01:51:08,720 --> 01:51:08,880
Why?

3698
01:51:08,880 --> 01:51:09,340
Where is that?

3699
01:51:09,580 --> 01:51:10,000
This is bad.

3700
01:51:11,240 --> 01:51:11,680
Dude.

3701
01:51:12,340 --> 01:51:12,780
Sykkuno.

3702
01:51:14,880 --> 01:51:15,320
Sykkuno.

3703
01:51:15,600 --> 01:51:15,820
Sykkuno.

3704
01:51:15,960 --> 01:51:16,400
Sykkuno.

3705
01:51:18,240 --> 01:51:18,680
Sykkuno.

3706
01:51:19,640 --> 01:51:19,740
I got yellow.

3707
01:51:19,780 --> 01:51:19,880
You said yellow.

3708
01:51:19,880 --> 01:51:21,360
And you said, I don't need that.

3709
01:51:21,460 --> 01:51:22,360
That's not how it sounds.

3710
01:51:22,520 --> 01:51:23,300
That's not how it sounds.

3711
01:51:24,300 --> 01:51:25,380
I don't need that.

3712
01:51:25,380 --> 01:51:26,440
I tried my best.

3713
01:51:26,440 --> 01:51:27,220
I tried my best to do the sound.

3714
01:51:27,220 --> 01:51:28,140
I don't need that.

3715
01:51:28,160 --> 01:51:28,660
I couldn't...

3716
01:51:28,660 --> 01:51:29,360
I don't need that.

3717
01:51:29,380 --> 01:51:30,560
But he definitely said that.

3718
01:51:30,620 --> 01:51:31,640
I offered you the yellow.

3719
01:51:31,700 --> 01:51:33,040
I was like, I'll give you the yellow.

3720
01:51:33,120 --> 01:51:33,480
Dude.

3721
01:51:33,960 --> 01:51:34,920
I'll have the yellow.

3722
01:51:36,140 --> 01:51:37,020
Nobody wants it.

3723
01:51:37,100 --> 01:51:37,800
I'll take the yellow.

3724
01:51:37,820 --> 01:51:38,500
I'll take the yellow.

3725
01:51:38,620 --> 01:51:39,700
Well, I'll take the yellow.

3726
01:51:39,700 --> 01:51:40,040
I'll take the orange yellow.

3727
01:51:40,180 --> 01:51:40,840
For the orange.

3728
01:51:40,840 --> 01:51:41,800
No, No, but for the blue.

3729
01:51:41,820 --> 01:51:43,060
For the blue, brethren.

3730
01:51:43,260 --> 01:51:43,780
For the blue.

3731
01:51:44,020 --> 01:51:44,580
Of course.

3732
01:51:44,840 --> 01:51:46,900
And the 400 bucks up, guarantor.

3733
01:51:46,900 --> 01:51:49,140
Roll me a 10, roll me a 10 if there's...

3734
01:51:49,140 --> 01:51:50,200
Oh, an 11.

3735
01:51:50,420 --> 01:51:50,760
Wait a minute.

3736
01:51:51,140 --> 01:51:52,620
Wait a second, wait a second.

3737
01:51:52,820 --> 01:51:53,880
Dude, Ellum has this one.

3738
01:51:54,340 --> 01:51:55,620
Oh no, it's the card.

3739
01:51:56,680 --> 01:51:57,080
Yes!

3740
01:51:57,600 --> 01:51:58,000
$50!

3741
01:51:58,360 --> 01:51:58,960
Let's go!

3742
01:51:59,180 --> 01:51:59,580
$50!

3743
01:51:59,580 --> 01:52:03,280
I think that Kuno has been like earning like $200 in this one.

3744
01:52:03,300 --> 01:52:06,920
This feels like when I switched to modern Zangief instead of classic Zangief.

3745
01:52:09,120 --> 01:52:09,720
Where's that?

3746
01:52:11,180 --> 01:52:12,600
Oh, does anyone... what is that?

3747
01:52:12,680 --> 01:52:13,140
Wait, that's free.

3748
01:52:13,240 --> 01:52:13,940
Whatever it is, it's free.

3749
01:52:14,700 --> 01:52:15,480
What is that?

3750
01:52:15,580 --> 01:52:18,820
Oh, it's because it's a chance being a thing.

3751
01:52:19,120 --> 01:52:19,900
Alright, what is that?

3752
01:52:20,620 --> 01:52:21,380
Oh, hey!

3753
01:52:21,380 --> 01:52:22,140
Oh, wow!

3754
01:52:22,580 --> 01:52:23,600
Hey, Doki!

3755
01:52:23,980 --> 01:52:24,500
Doki!

3756
01:52:25,640 --> 01:52:26,160
Wow!

3757
01:52:28,880 --> 01:52:29,920
So, Doki!

3758
01:52:30,320 --> 01:52:31,760
What's the deal here?

3759
01:52:32,020 --> 01:52:35,460
Doki, my good friend Doki, you know...

3760
01:52:35,460 --> 01:52:36,740
What's the deal here?

3761
01:52:36,960 --> 01:52:37,780
Give me your blue.

3762
01:52:37,960 --> 01:52:38,940
Me and you, we go way back.

3763
01:52:39,260 --> 01:52:40,680
Give me your blue!

3764
01:52:41,660 --> 01:52:43,740
Oh, so you're ditching your alliance?

3765
01:52:43,940 --> 01:52:44,980
You're not even loyal.

3766
01:52:45,340 --> 01:52:46,380
You're already ditching your alliance with Sykkuno.

3767
01:52:46,380 --> 01:52:46,920
What do you mean?

3768
01:52:46,980 --> 01:52:47,600
No, no, no.

3769
01:52:47,720 --> 01:52:50,800
Because if you give me the dark blue, then I'll give him the orange.

3770
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:53,580
So really, you're only screwing Sykkuno over if you don't give it to me.

3771
01:52:55,440 --> 01:52:57,660
Oh, so you are screwing him over.

3772
01:52:58,680 --> 01:53:01,400
I mean, I'll take the orange, I mean...

3773
01:53:01,400 --> 01:53:02,700
No, wait a second.

3774
01:53:02,860 --> 01:53:08,600
If I land on Mayfair now, I'm going to go scorch your earth and just...

3775
01:53:09,440 --> 01:53:10,920
How did we all land on Mayfair?

3776
01:53:11,220 --> 01:53:12,200
We're just Trafalgar Square.

3777
01:53:12,200 --> 01:53:13,720
We're not huge, dude.

3778
01:53:13,720 --> 01:53:14,420
You say Illinois?

3779
01:53:14,740 --> 01:53:15,880
I'm in Trafalgar Square.

3780
01:53:15,960 --> 01:53:16,940
Am I seeing a different game team?

3781
01:53:17,160 --> 01:53:17,480
Oh, nobody has that.

3782
01:53:17,740 --> 01:53:23,940
The reds are on the board if anyone wants to make a crazy trade for it.

3783
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:24,720
Here we go, please.

3784
01:53:24,860 --> 01:53:25,480
Give me something good.

3785
01:53:26,200 --> 01:53:26,580
Wait.

3786
01:53:27,700 --> 01:53:28,280
Wait a second.

3787
01:53:28,320 --> 01:53:28,660
Is that jail?

3788
01:53:29,020 --> 01:53:29,620
It's jail.

3789
01:53:29,820 --> 01:53:32,020
Oh, for frick's sake, dude.

3790
01:53:34,840 --> 01:53:37,500
To be honest, at least you passed Go and got $200.

3791
01:53:37,540 --> 01:53:41,280
Honestly, being in jail is safe right now because almost every property is bought now.

3792
01:53:41,320 --> 01:53:42,500
Guys, I'm open for trades.

3793
01:53:42,620 --> 01:53:43,300
I'm open for trades.

3794
01:53:43,380 --> 01:53:44,220
Let me tell you that, okay?

3795
01:53:44,360 --> 01:53:47,780
We got to figure out some kind of trades to go over here.

3796
01:53:48,280 --> 01:53:50,340
Well, actually, the only ones available are like...

3797
01:53:51,340 --> 01:53:52,260
Not yellow.

3798
01:53:52,340 --> 01:53:52,820
Red?

3799
01:53:53,760 --> 01:53:55,740
Red and blue are the only available ones.

3800
01:53:56,840 --> 01:53:58,780
Like, of all owned properties.

3801
01:54:00,600 --> 01:54:02,920
You get $150, dude?

3802
01:54:04,060 --> 01:54:04,540
$150?

3803
01:54:04,880 --> 01:54:05,240
Jesus.

3804
01:54:05,540 --> 01:54:06,280
God damn.

3805
01:54:07,120 --> 01:54:08,240
Give me a nine.

3806
01:54:08,480 --> 01:54:09,600
Looking for a nine here.

3807
01:54:09,640 --> 01:54:10,820
That's not a nine.

3808
01:54:11,180 --> 01:54:11,620
Seven.

3809
01:54:12,400 --> 01:54:13,260
Where's that gonna land you?

3810
01:54:13,360 --> 01:54:14,060
Who owns that?

3811
01:54:14,320 --> 01:54:15,160
Oh, that's nothing.

3812
01:54:15,860 --> 01:54:16,420
No, no.

3813
01:54:16,480 --> 01:54:16,740
It's the...

3814
01:54:16,740 --> 01:54:18,100
Oh, it's the other brown.

3815
01:54:18,340 --> 01:54:19,040
Oh, my God.

3816
01:54:19,060 --> 01:54:20,020
That was Hewn's monopoly.

3817
01:54:20,400 --> 01:54:20,880
That's what it was.

3818
01:54:20,880 --> 01:54:24,300
I buy this and leverage it against Hewn with an auction.

3819
01:54:25,540 --> 01:54:25,980
What?

3820
01:54:26,160 --> 01:54:26,600
$100.

3821
01:54:27,320 --> 01:54:28,200
No way.

3822
01:54:28,400 --> 01:54:28,820
You know what?

3823
01:54:28,940 --> 01:54:29,600
Hewn needs this.

3824
01:54:29,740 --> 01:54:32,140
She'll have the first monopoly in the game if she gets this.

3825
01:54:32,600 --> 01:54:33,040
$10.

3826
01:54:35,020 --> 01:54:38,040
She'll literally be the only person who can upgrade her properties.

3827
01:54:38,060 --> 01:54:41,720
I'm doing this mainly because I just wanna see what Hewn does.

3828
01:54:43,180 --> 01:54:44,720
Is he gonna put in $100?

3829
01:54:45,040 --> 01:54:47,420
I feel like it's gotta be... Oh, dude!

3830
01:54:48,980 --> 01:54:50,540
But guys, it's...

3831
01:54:50,540 --> 01:54:57,680
We have to stop her because if she buys this and we can't make a deal, she's the only person who can upgrade houses.

3832
01:54:58,200 --> 01:55:01,480
Like, it's too powerful to let her have... I'm bidding $1.

3833
01:55:01,840 --> 01:55:02,800
I'm bidding $1.

3834
01:55:03,240 --> 01:55:05,320
If you really wanna stop her, just bid $100.

3835
01:55:05,320 --> 01:55:07,000
Dude, $450 with a hotel?

3836
01:55:07,640 --> 01:55:08,760
She's gonna be cooking us.

3837
01:55:08,800 --> 01:55:10,740
If you really wanna stop her, just bid $100.

3838
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:13,240
Yeah, just bid $100 if you wanna stop me.

3839
01:55:13,520 --> 01:55:15,060
Yeah, so bid $100.

3840
01:55:15,800 --> 01:55:16,720
Someone's gonna...

3841
01:55:16,720 --> 01:55:18,100
You have a lot of money.

3842
01:55:18,760 --> 01:55:19,540
Divide it by 10.

3843
01:55:20,360 --> 01:55:21,560
Yeah, there it is.

3844
01:55:21,840 --> 01:55:22,260
There it is.

3845
01:55:22,620 --> 01:55:23,760
I'm gonna bid $100.

3846
01:55:23,880 --> 01:55:25,260
There it is.

3847
01:55:26,840 --> 01:55:27,800
Hit $100.

3848
01:55:28,180 --> 01:55:29,500
I'm bidding $100 right now.

3849
01:55:29,720 --> 01:55:31,260
There it is.

3850
01:55:33,440 --> 01:55:34,960
Dude, how high is she gonna go?

3851
01:55:35,560 --> 01:55:36,660
Dude, how valuable do you want this?

3852
01:55:36,660 --> 01:55:36,940
Just do it.

3853
01:55:36,960 --> 01:55:37,860
Do $100 here.

3854
01:55:38,800 --> 01:55:40,020
You're not gonna do it.

3855
01:55:40,020 --> 01:55:41,820
How valuable do you want this soon?

3856
01:55:42,420 --> 01:55:49,820
Okay, according to my estimates, I'd say the most value is like $450, cause then someone would only need to land on it once for her to get paid back, right?

3857
01:55:50,340 --> 01:55:51,960
Cause you get $450 with a hotel.

3858
01:55:52,640 --> 01:55:55,300
So there's no way she pays more than $450 for it.

3859
01:55:56,160 --> 01:55:59,660
Unless, like, she thinks that... She's grayed out cause she voted out of the bid, basically.

3860
01:55:59,800 --> 01:56:02,260
I feel like math-matically...

3861
01:56:02,260 --> 01:56:03,320
What do you mean?

3862
01:56:05,860 --> 01:56:06,260
Dude.

3863
01:56:06,500 --> 01:56:07,320
Oh, man.

3864
01:56:07,340 --> 01:56:08,020
Oh, man.

3865
01:56:08,580 --> 01:56:09,480
It's up to you, man.

3866
01:56:09,520 --> 01:56:10,160
You gotta stop her.

3867
01:56:11,420 --> 01:56:12,060
Bid $100.

3868
01:56:12,240 --> 01:56:13,600
Why is it Ellen's job?

3869
01:56:14,380 --> 01:56:15,480
Ellen bid $100.

3870
01:56:16,300 --> 01:56:17,300
Ellen bid $100.

3871
01:56:17,420 --> 01:56:17,980
I'll give you the yellow.

3872
01:56:18,540 --> 01:56:19,620
I'll give you the yellow, bro.

3873
01:56:19,640 --> 01:56:20,800
I'll give you the yellow.

3874
01:56:20,940 --> 01:56:21,880
You'll give me the yellow?

3875
01:56:22,820 --> 01:56:23,880
Yeah, I'll give you the yellow.

3876
01:56:24,340 --> 01:56:25,060
For the orange.

3877
01:56:25,940 --> 01:56:26,340
Wait.

3878
01:56:27,780 --> 01:56:28,580
Oh, man.

3879
01:56:29,040 --> 01:56:30,460
Dude, I don't know if I...

3880
01:56:30,800 --> 01:56:32,460
I'm getting kinda... I'll do $100.

3881
01:56:33,060 --> 01:56:34,000
And see what she does.

3882
01:56:35,900 --> 01:56:36,300
Wow.

3883
01:56:36,900 --> 01:56:38,100
You didn't do another $100.

3884
01:56:38,100 --> 01:56:40,920
Well, I feel like maximum mathematical value is still higher than this.

3885
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:43,120
Because she'll be the only... She'll actually have the monopoly.

3886
01:56:43,500 --> 01:56:44,700
And nobody else will.

3887
01:56:45,080 --> 01:56:45,800
That's crazy.

3888
01:56:46,680 --> 01:56:47,780
Fuck that, dude.

3889
01:56:49,500 --> 01:56:50,960
Dude, she actually... She's crazy.

3890
01:56:51,160 --> 01:56:52,100
She's crazy, man.

3891
01:56:52,120 --> 01:56:53,900
Oh, my God, dude.

3892
01:56:54,940 --> 01:56:56,060
Why are you getting mad at me?

3893
01:56:56,180 --> 01:56:57,440
You're the one who backed out first.

3894
01:56:57,520 --> 01:56:58,300
You made me lose hope.

3895
01:56:59,220 --> 01:57:00,540
Now she has a monopoly.

3896
01:57:00,720 --> 01:57:01,440
We're gonna lose the game.

3897
01:57:01,440 --> 01:57:02,700
That's down to you, bro.

3898
01:57:02,780 --> 01:57:03,520
That's down to you.

3899
01:57:03,760 --> 01:57:04,440
You're an idiot.

3900
01:57:04,540 --> 01:57:05,620
You're a bumbling idiot.

3901
01:57:05,760 --> 01:57:06,280
You're a bumbling idiot.

3902
01:57:06,480 --> 01:57:08,380
Dude, you backed out and made me lose confidence.

3903
01:57:08,380 --> 01:57:10,020
There's actually no way they gave up.

3904
01:57:10,080 --> 01:57:10,840
Why did you give up?

3905
01:57:10,880 --> 01:57:11,640
Why did you give up?

3906
01:57:12,360 --> 01:57:13,760
Because you gave up first.

3907
01:57:14,320 --> 01:57:15,360
Communicate with me, bro.

3908
01:57:17,260 --> 01:57:18,160
Communicate with me.

3909
01:57:18,200 --> 01:57:21,100
You're the worst Keefer I've ever seen.

3910
01:57:21,100 --> 01:57:22,680
...on this bomb and we're done.

3911
01:57:22,880 --> 01:57:23,400
We're done.

3912
01:57:23,480 --> 01:57:24,560
This game's gonna be over quick.

3913
01:57:25,120 --> 01:57:25,880
We're gonna be dead.

3914
01:57:26,040 --> 01:57:27,000
We're just gonna be dead.

3915
01:57:29,980 --> 01:57:32,580
I thought we had an unspoken bond, you idiot.

3916
01:57:33,160 --> 01:57:34,760
Dude, she's got a monopoly.

3917
01:57:35,600 --> 01:57:37,220
It's actually, we're in trouble now.

3918
01:57:37,420 --> 01:57:42,100
And now she's gonna sue all the houses and none of us is gonna be able to monopolize any of our properties because Sykkuno's an idiot.

3919
01:57:43,240 --> 01:57:44,300
Actually, you backed out first.

3920
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:45,740
Yeah, and I wouldn't have...

3921
01:57:47,320 --> 01:57:49,640
What are you, a fucking pirate?

3922
01:57:49,780 --> 01:57:50,580
What the hell does that even mean?

3923
01:57:50,660 --> 01:57:51,280
Oh wait, this is my turn.

3924
01:57:51,560 --> 01:57:57,440
Dude, I keep doing these postions and since Hewn won, I was like, oh, it must be her turn.

3925
01:57:58,480 --> 01:57:59,620
No, no, Sivin.

3926
01:58:00,120 --> 01:58:01,020
Is this the taxi?

3927
01:58:01,020 --> 01:58:02,080
I've known taxis before.

3928
01:58:02,340 --> 01:58:03,400
I don't know.

3929
01:58:04,260 --> 01:58:04,580
Yay!

3930
01:58:05,080 --> 01:58:05,980
Oh, it's tax...

3931
01:58:05,980 --> 01:58:07,680
No, it's my property!

3932
01:58:07,940 --> 01:58:08,420
That's mine!

3933
01:58:09,240 --> 01:58:09,560
Toki!

3934
01:58:10,460 --> 01:58:11,340
Would you like to...

3935
01:58:11,340 --> 01:58:14,940
Oh my god, another one.

3936
01:58:14,940 --> 01:58:16,620
Trade it to her for the blue, maybe.

3937
01:58:16,720 --> 01:58:17,060
I don't know.

3938
01:58:17,140 --> 01:58:19,040
Yeah, Toki, I'll give you the light blue for the dark blue.

3939
01:58:19,660 --> 01:58:20,240
Wait, really?

3940
01:58:20,380 --> 01:58:21,220
For the red?

3941
01:58:21,300 --> 01:58:22,000
No, I want the dark blue.

3942
01:58:22,060 --> 01:58:22,660
I want the dark blue, though.

3943
01:58:23,620 --> 01:58:23,860
No.

3944
01:58:26,320 --> 01:58:30,460
But the red won't help him enough because he would have to get the third red from Hewn.

3945
01:58:30,460 --> 01:58:32,920
It's just gonna be too hard.

3946
01:58:33,240 --> 01:58:34,940
I'll take it for the red.

3947
01:58:35,360 --> 01:58:36,260
Or the pink.

3948
01:58:36,580 --> 01:58:37,640
Red or pink?

3949
01:58:38,520 --> 01:58:39,900
Take it or leave it.

3950
01:58:40,360 --> 01:58:44,520
Hewn will actually just dominate because he's the only one who can even buy houses right now.

3951
01:58:45,060 --> 01:58:45,540
Yay!

3952
01:58:45,540 --> 01:58:48,080
The rest of us are getting 20 bucks a pop from landing on spots.

3953
01:58:48,240 --> 01:58:50,260
You either get the red or pink.

3954
01:58:50,620 --> 01:58:52,020
That's my deal.

3955
01:58:52,900 --> 01:58:53,920
Red or pink.

3956
01:58:54,900 --> 01:58:55,820
I'm colorblind.

3957
01:58:55,940 --> 01:58:56,660
We should go with dark blue.

3958
01:58:58,200 --> 01:59:01,780
I'm also colorblind, but I can't see dark blue.

3959
01:59:02,060 --> 01:59:02,300
Shit!

3960
01:59:02,560 --> 01:59:02,740
Shit!

3961
01:59:05,520 --> 01:59:07,140
She's buying houses right now.

3962
01:59:08,560 --> 01:59:10,080
She's buying houses right now.

3963
01:59:10,100 --> 01:59:10,720
She's buying houses right now.

3964
01:59:10,720 --> 01:59:10,760
She's buying houses right now.

3965
01:59:10,760 --> 01:59:11,320
Red or pink.

3966
01:59:11,400 --> 01:59:13,780
Dude, if you land on Baltic, that's $450.

3967
01:59:16,720 --> 01:59:18,920
$450 Smekis on one ball.

3968
01:59:18,940 --> 01:59:19,420
$450 Smekis on one ball.

3969
01:59:19,420 --> 01:59:19,960
That's bad.

3970
01:59:20,680 --> 01:59:21,900
That's gonna be bad.

3971
01:59:22,600 --> 01:59:23,920
I wish you luck.

3972
01:59:25,520 --> 01:59:25,960
Dude.

3973
01:59:28,320 --> 01:59:29,500
No way, dude.

3974
01:59:29,560 --> 01:59:30,740
Why didn't you trade for this, man?

3975
01:59:30,840 --> 01:59:31,660
What do you mean?

3976
01:59:33,840 --> 01:59:35,940
You've been farming me.

3977
01:59:35,940 --> 01:59:37,520
What are you talking about?

3978
01:59:37,820 --> 01:59:39,580
That was my children's lunch money.

3979
01:59:39,700 --> 01:59:40,460
You just took it from me.

3980
01:59:40,460 --> 01:59:44,420
You know, honestly, screw your children's lunch money because you've been farming me the whole time.

3981
01:59:45,340 --> 01:59:46,940
I'm not backing you up.

3982
01:59:47,240 --> 01:59:48,420
What are you saying, man?

3983
01:59:49,400 --> 01:59:50,460
What are you saying?

3984
01:59:50,600 --> 01:59:51,780
You've been farming me.

3985
01:59:52,640 --> 01:59:54,660
I got $20 from you.

3986
01:59:55,180 --> 01:59:55,620
$20.

3987
01:59:55,760 --> 01:59:57,760
And I offered you the yellow for the record.

3988
01:59:57,860 --> 01:59:58,840
I offered you it.

3989
01:59:58,940 --> 01:59:59,580
I did.

3990
01:59:59,820 --> 02:00:04,500
He said, Kuno, I'll take the yellow and I'll give you the red.

3991
02:00:04,820 --> 02:00:06,720
I'm thinking you're giving me $50 right now.

3992
02:00:10,320 --> 02:00:10,920
That's right.

3993
02:00:11,020 --> 02:00:13,320
That's my train station that Ellen gave me.

3994
02:00:14,140 --> 02:00:16,980
Which means I screwed you over there, Dokia.

3995
02:00:16,980 --> 02:00:19,380
Oh, okay.

3996
02:00:19,380 --> 02:00:21,260
I guess I'll trade with Huun then.

3997
02:00:21,260 --> 02:00:21,980
No, wait, don't.

3998
02:00:22,220 --> 02:00:22,540
Huun.

3999
02:00:22,980 --> 02:00:23,300
Huun.

4000
02:00:23,300 --> 02:00:23,620
Huun.

4001
02:00:23,780 --> 02:00:24,600
Don't give her the dog food.

4002
02:00:24,940 --> 02:00:26,100
Don't give her the dog food, please.

4003
02:00:26,180 --> 02:00:28,100
I'll give you a yellow if you give me the red.

4004
02:00:29,200 --> 02:00:30,100
Sure, why not.

4005
02:00:30,900 --> 02:00:31,640
Sure, why not.

4006
02:00:33,440 --> 02:00:33,760
Guys.

4007
02:00:33,760 --> 02:00:34,080
Guys.

4008
02:00:34,620 --> 02:00:34,940
Huun.

4009
02:00:35,180 --> 02:00:36,780
Wait, that's not a bad trade, I feel like.

4010
02:00:36,820 --> 02:00:38,960
Yellow for red is pretty fair, I guess.

4011
02:00:39,120 --> 02:00:41,000
I mean, at least you guys kind of cooked, though.

4012
02:00:41,460 --> 02:00:42,780
Huun, let me give you a counter offer.

4013
02:00:42,940 --> 02:00:46,700
You give me the red and I give you two of any color you like.

4014
02:00:48,960 --> 02:00:49,360
What?

4015
02:00:49,760 --> 02:00:51,900
Dude, Ellen, why are you trying to mess this deal up so bad?

4016
02:00:52,740 --> 02:00:54,480
Neither of them have monopolies.

4017
02:00:54,540 --> 02:00:55,260
Neither of them.

4018
02:00:55,280 --> 02:01:01,020
After this trade, you have a red and I have a yellow, right?

4019
02:01:01,100 --> 02:01:01,380
True!

4020
02:01:02,240 --> 02:01:07,760
So we hold the key that they need, and as long as neither of us folds, then we're tillin'.

4021
02:01:07,760 --> 02:01:10,320
Which, of course, we won't, right, Saikuu?

4022
02:01:10,420 --> 02:01:11,920
Yeah, neither of us are gonna fold.

4023
02:01:11,920 --> 02:01:13,260
Neither of us would fold, right?

4024
02:01:13,660 --> 02:01:14,680
Who wants the dark blue?

4025
02:01:16,980 --> 02:01:18,120
Me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me.

4026
02:01:18,160 --> 02:01:20,560
Dude, dude, what happened to none of us fold?

4027
02:01:21,180 --> 02:01:22,760
What happened to neither of us fold?

4028
02:01:22,900 --> 02:01:23,560
I'm not gonna fold.

4029
02:01:24,300 --> 02:01:25,280
It's what I would've said.

4030
02:01:25,340 --> 02:01:28,600
It's what I would've said if I was being serious.

4031
02:01:28,700 --> 02:01:30,760
But of course, I'm not being serious, you know?

4032
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:32,840
Yeah, listen, I have one yellow.

4033
02:01:33,020 --> 02:01:33,880
You have one red.

4034
02:01:34,320 --> 02:01:36,100
Neither of us fold, they got no power.

4035
02:01:36,140 --> 02:01:37,400
They just wasted their time with this trade.

4036
02:01:37,520 --> 02:01:38,960
They wasted their time, Ellen.

4037
02:01:39,400 --> 02:01:42,480
You and me, we're rock solid like Malphite from League of Legends.

4038
02:01:43,140 --> 02:01:44,500
Pinky and the Brain, baby, we got this.

4039
02:01:44,500 --> 02:01:44,980
We got it.

4040
02:01:45,040 --> 02:01:45,620
Here we go.

4041
02:01:46,060 --> 02:01:48,340
Neither of us fold and give up the yellow or the red.

4042
02:01:48,540 --> 02:01:50,560
Let me get the hell out of here, man.

4043
02:01:51,260 --> 02:01:51,800
Look at that.

4044
02:01:51,960 --> 02:01:54,160
Tycoon, I'll trade you a dark blue for your yellow.

4045
02:01:55,520 --> 02:01:56,860
Oh, I mean, I don't really need...

4046
02:01:56,860 --> 02:01:58,940
If you got the orange, though, I might think about it.

4047
02:01:59,260 --> 02:02:00,340
If I was willing...

4048
02:02:00,340 --> 02:02:02,500
If I was willing to fold, which I'm not.

4049
02:02:02,580 --> 02:02:04,340
Sorry, what are you saying?

4050
02:02:04,480 --> 02:02:05,740
You would think about it?

4051
02:02:06,140 --> 02:02:08,760
You said you were unfoldable on the first side.

4052
02:02:08,760 --> 02:02:09,340
That's what I said.

4053
02:02:09,440 --> 02:02:11,560
I said if I were willing to fold, which I'm not.

4054
02:02:11,560 --> 02:02:13,540
And then you straight away fold.

4055
02:02:14,160 --> 02:02:14,940
What do you mean?

4056
02:02:15,160 --> 02:02:15,820
I didn't.

4057
02:02:15,820 --> 02:02:16,640
She doesn't have the orange.

4058
02:02:16,640 --> 02:02:17,960
You instantly folded.

4059
02:02:18,760 --> 02:02:22,420
Dude, I said if I was willing to fold, which I'm not.

4060
02:02:22,920 --> 02:02:26,000
That's like saying if I had a million bucks, I'd buy you a Lamborghini.

4061
02:02:26,800 --> 02:02:27,400
What, you would?

4062
02:02:27,520 --> 02:02:29,560
A billion bucks, sorry.

4063
02:02:29,600 --> 02:02:33,720
A billion bucks, sorry.

4064
02:02:33,740 --> 02:02:35,340
Sorry, that was the greatest thing you ever said.

4065
02:02:35,980 --> 02:02:36,920
No, no, no.

4066
02:02:37,020 --> 02:02:38,980
I said a billion.

4067
02:02:39,240 --> 02:02:40,720
A billion, not one million.

4068
02:02:41,560 --> 02:02:42,980
One billion with a B.

4069
02:02:43,100 --> 02:02:44,500
With a B, yeah.

4070
02:02:44,660 --> 02:02:45,460
I just realized.

4071
02:02:45,740 --> 02:02:47,960
I thought about that.

4072
02:02:48,060 --> 02:02:49,540
States Avenue, I got the last pink.

4073
02:02:49,900 --> 02:02:51,840
You can't buy this property.

4074
02:02:53,580 --> 02:02:58,120
I'll give you a dark blue if you give me your red and pink.

4075
02:03:05,400 --> 02:03:07,520
Wait, is he deafened?

4076
02:03:07,900 --> 02:03:08,600
Oh, shit.

4077
02:03:08,600 --> 02:03:09,720
No, wait, no.

4078
02:03:10,420 --> 02:03:10,780
No.

4079
02:03:13,260 --> 02:03:14,440
No, nothing, nothing, nothing.

4080
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:15,360
Yeah?

4081
02:03:16,240 --> 02:03:17,700
You're getting paid out a little bit, $20.

4082
02:03:18,080 --> 02:03:18,660
There it is.

4083
02:03:20,300 --> 02:03:21,800
I'm going into the trade.

4084
02:03:25,260 --> 02:03:26,280
Do you want it?

4085
02:03:26,320 --> 02:03:26,900
What are you doing?

4086
02:03:27,080 --> 02:03:28,720
If you give her the red, she's gonna kill her.

4087
02:03:28,780 --> 02:03:31,000
Let me just see what we're offering.

4088
02:03:32,020 --> 02:03:33,340
What happened to neither of us?

4089
02:03:34,120 --> 02:03:35,440
Yeah, what happened?

4090
02:03:36,440 --> 02:03:38,360
You think she'll give you the blue for the...

4091
02:03:38,360 --> 02:03:40,080
Oh, wait, she's actually giving you the blue.

4092
02:03:40,540 --> 02:03:41,980
Ellum, neither of us fold, remember?

4093
02:03:42,220 --> 02:03:47,060
If you give her the red, if you give her the red here, we're gonna be in a bad, bad spot.

4094
02:03:48,480 --> 02:03:51,140
Like, a lot of, like, really bad spot, man.

4095
02:03:51,320 --> 02:03:52,500
She's gonna have a monopoly.

4096
02:03:53,420 --> 02:03:55,040
She's gonna have a monopoly, Ellum.

4097
02:03:55,200 --> 02:03:55,780
Let me tell you.

4098
02:03:55,880 --> 02:03:56,600
Let me tell you.

4099
02:03:57,000 --> 02:03:58,880
Dude, don't give her the pink, too.

4100
02:03:59,160 --> 02:03:59,880
I'm not doing this.

4101
02:03:59,900 --> 02:04:00,260
This isn't me.

4102
02:04:00,300 --> 02:04:01,280
She's controlling this.

4103
02:04:01,340 --> 02:04:01,700
This isn't me.

4104
02:04:01,800 --> 02:04:02,280
Oh, yeah, I know.

4105
02:04:02,360 --> 02:04:03,340
I mean, I'm just...

4106
02:04:05,440 --> 02:04:06,220
I'm innocent in this whole thing.

4107
02:04:06,280 --> 02:04:09,240
Dude, there's no way you accept this.

4108
02:04:10,500 --> 02:04:11,080
She's crazy.

4109
02:04:11,440 --> 02:04:12,340
Maybe one of them.

4110
02:04:12,420 --> 02:04:12,960
Maybe one of them.

4111
02:04:13,060 --> 02:04:14,060
You don't fold.

4112
02:04:14,240 --> 02:04:14,940
You just don't fold.

4113
02:04:14,980 --> 02:04:17,460
If neither of us fold, the reds and the yellows will be locked down.

4114
02:04:18,400 --> 02:04:20,700
That's $2,000 if you can build a hotel.

4115
02:04:21,220 --> 02:04:24,200
They will be locked down, Ellum.

4116
02:04:25,140 --> 02:04:26,020
Locked down.

4117
02:04:26,420 --> 02:04:31,720
To be fair, you know, like, I'm looking at the value here, and if anything, it's better for me in a way.

4118
02:04:32,380 --> 02:04:35,940
But, you know, I mean, in a way, I'm just not.

4119
02:04:36,580 --> 02:04:37,620
Ellum, don't be a fool.

4120
02:04:37,620 --> 02:04:42,680
If you build a hotel, you get $2,000 for one thing you land on, Ellum.

4121
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:44,260
$2,000.

4122
02:04:44,560 --> 02:04:46,280
Ellum, don't do it, man.

4123
02:04:48,100 --> 02:04:50,280
They're known to win you games.

4124
02:04:50,380 --> 02:04:52,480
The dark blue is what wins you the game.

4125
02:04:52,780 --> 02:04:54,720
I think they're actually the least likely to win you the game.

4126
02:04:54,900 --> 02:04:57,100
No, I won my last game with Broadwalk.

4127
02:04:57,320 --> 02:04:57,940
Did you?

4128
02:04:58,280 --> 02:05:00,920
Yeah, I won my last game with Broadwalk.

4129
02:05:01,040 --> 02:05:03,440
I won my last game with Broadwalk.

4130
02:05:03,440 --> 02:05:05,360
At least ask for some more money or something.

4131
02:05:05,460 --> 02:05:07,400
Put some money in.

4132
02:05:07,440 --> 02:05:08,080
Do you know what I mean?

4133
02:05:09,020 --> 02:05:14,080
Ellum, I'm never gonna trade this ever again if you don't accept the initial offer.

4134
02:05:14,080 --> 02:05:15,600
She's doing salesman tactics.

4135
02:05:16,320 --> 02:05:17,580
She's doing the walk away.

4136
02:05:17,860 --> 02:05:20,540
Don't fall for it.

4137
02:05:21,020 --> 02:05:23,680
This is a classic walk away tactic.

4138
02:05:23,980 --> 02:05:30,020
Ellum, all I'm saying is that this is the one time I'm doing this trade.

4139
02:05:30,680 --> 02:05:33,340
And if you don't take that trade, I'm trading with Sykuno.

4140
02:05:33,940 --> 02:05:34,860
Ellum, it's so easy.

4141
02:05:36,240 --> 02:05:37,700
That means you only have to say no once.

4142
02:05:37,700 --> 02:05:38,220
Offer it again.

4143
02:05:38,340 --> 02:05:38,640
Offer it again.

4144
02:05:38,900 --> 02:05:40,520
You only have to say no once, Ellum.

4145
02:05:40,560 --> 02:05:41,940
You only have to say no once.

4146
02:05:42,040 --> 02:05:42,380
That's all.

4147
02:05:43,560 --> 02:05:44,440
He said no.

4148
02:05:44,460 --> 02:05:44,980
He said no.

4149
02:05:46,820 --> 02:05:48,080
Ellum, don't give in, man.

4150
02:05:48,620 --> 02:05:49,940
He's gonna have all the reds.

4151
02:05:50,200 --> 02:05:51,160
He's gonna have all the reds.

4152
02:05:51,160 --> 02:05:51,760
We're gonna lose the game.

4153
02:05:52,040 --> 02:05:52,560
No, no, no.

4154
02:05:53,640 --> 02:05:54,400
Hit me out.

4155
02:05:54,500 --> 02:05:54,760
Hit me out.

4156
02:05:56,040 --> 02:05:56,360
Okay.

4157
02:05:57,160 --> 02:05:58,460
What if I folded a tad?

4158
02:05:58,600 --> 02:05:59,260
Like a smidge.

4159
02:06:00,020 --> 02:06:00,660
Like a foldable chair.

4160
02:06:00,820 --> 02:06:03,660
I say at worst, do the blue for one red.

4161
02:06:04,200 --> 02:06:05,060
Blue for one red.

4162
02:06:05,120 --> 02:06:05,540
Come on.

4163
02:06:05,580 --> 02:06:06,600
Come on, Doki.

4164
02:06:06,720 --> 02:06:06,960
No, wait.

4165
02:06:07,000 --> 02:06:07,360
No, no, no.

4166
02:06:07,360 --> 02:06:08,140
Dude, we're folding.

4167
02:06:08,260 --> 02:06:09,120
No, don't do anything.

4168
02:06:09,400 --> 02:06:09,920
Just say no.

4169
02:06:11,840 --> 02:06:12,480
It's a classic.

4170
02:06:13,120 --> 02:06:13,520
Okay.

4171
02:06:14,880 --> 02:06:17,820
This is the only time I'm making this deal, Ellum.

4172
02:06:17,820 --> 02:06:19,180
If you don't trade with Sykuno.

4173
02:06:19,700 --> 02:06:22,200
I'm trading with Sykuno if you don't take this deal.

4174
02:06:22,240 --> 02:06:24,380
And you know Sykuno is gonna take the deal.

4175
02:06:24,780 --> 02:06:26,480
Ellum, you know I wouldn't take the deal.

4176
02:06:26,560 --> 02:06:27,100
You would.

4177
02:06:27,240 --> 02:06:28,400
You literally would take the deal.

4178
02:06:28,440 --> 02:06:28,960
The only reason I take the deal is that you took the deal.

4179
02:06:30,020 --> 02:06:34,080
That doesn't make sense because then that means if I would have already made the deal, then you can't take the deal because I would have already taken it.

4180
02:06:34,160 --> 02:06:34,740
I don't want the blue one.

4181
02:06:34,840 --> 02:06:35,880
I would trade her for a different one.

4182
02:06:36,240 --> 02:06:37,900
But if you do it, I'll be forced to.

4183
02:06:38,340 --> 02:06:40,400
Ellum, if you take this deal, I'll be forced to it.

4184
02:06:40,400 --> 02:06:41,240
She's gonna win the game.

4185
02:06:41,280 --> 02:06:41,940
She's gonna win the game.

4186
02:06:43,340 --> 02:06:44,460
Okay, hear me out.

4187
02:06:44,960 --> 02:06:47,500
I have nothing to lose here.

4188
02:06:47,500 --> 02:06:48,880
Sykuno, you've got nothing to worry about.

4189
02:06:49,040 --> 02:06:50,000
I'm gonna reject it.

4190
02:06:50,060 --> 02:06:52,140
Because me, I am unfoldable.

4191
02:06:52,520 --> 02:06:53,880
This means he's accepting it, bro.

4192
02:06:53,880 --> 02:06:54,920
Which means I'm accepting it.

4193
02:06:56,420 --> 02:06:58,940
Bro, this is the worst trade in the history of trade.

4194
02:06:59,680 --> 02:07:00,000
Ellum.

4195
02:07:00,020 --> 02:07:01,100
Look what you've done.

4196
02:07:01,160 --> 02:07:02,280
Look what you've done, you fool.

4197
02:07:02,760 --> 02:07:04,040
We're all going to lose now.

4198
02:07:04,300 --> 02:07:05,120
Oh my god.

4199
02:07:05,300 --> 02:07:06,000
Oh my god.

4200
02:07:11,300 --> 02:07:12,720
Wait, that was a bad deal?

4201
02:07:12,880 --> 02:07:14,040
Dude, she just bought two houses.

4202
02:07:14,300 --> 02:07:14,760
She's crazy.

4203
02:07:15,280 --> 02:07:15,880
She's rich.

4204
02:07:16,160 --> 02:07:17,380
She's rich that I didn't even realize.

4205
02:07:18,140 --> 02:07:18,840
Ellum, we're in trouble.

4206
02:07:19,020 --> 02:07:19,540
We're in trouble.

4207
02:07:20,800 --> 02:07:22,040
Syk, trust in me.

4208
02:07:22,060 --> 02:07:23,720
Wait a second.

4209
02:07:23,820 --> 02:07:24,420
Wait a second.

4210
02:07:24,740 --> 02:07:25,360
Wait a second.

4211
02:07:26,040 --> 02:07:27,620
Wait, does that land you on the house in mind?

4212
02:07:27,640 --> 02:07:28,100
Wait a second.

4213
02:07:28,280 --> 02:07:28,440
Wait, does it?

4214
02:07:32,920 --> 02:07:33,720
Thank you.

4215
02:07:33,900 --> 02:07:34,720
This is bad.

4216
02:07:35,040 --> 02:07:35,720
This is bad.

4217
02:07:36,140 --> 02:07:38,300
We're gonna get a monopoly at this point.

4218
02:07:38,840 --> 02:07:40,460
More money to upgrade my property.

4219
02:07:40,460 --> 02:07:41,000
Ellum, buy houses.

4220
02:07:41,280 --> 02:07:42,080
I'm buying houses.

4221
02:07:42,240 --> 02:07:42,760
I'm buying houses.

4222
02:07:43,360 --> 02:07:43,940
Oh yeah.

4223
02:07:44,140 --> 02:07:44,900
Oh yeah.

4224
02:07:45,200 --> 02:07:46,500
Dude, you psychopath.

4225
02:07:46,880 --> 02:07:47,460
What do you mean?

4226
02:07:47,500 --> 02:07:47,940
This is good.

4227
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:48,760
This is good for us.

4228
02:07:49,200 --> 02:07:51,980
I'm thinking of the long game of our team, bro.

4229
02:07:52,020 --> 02:07:52,400
What do you mean?

4230
02:07:53,600 --> 02:07:54,960
Our team, he says.

4231
02:07:56,200 --> 02:07:58,320
Our team, he says, as he takes the deal.

4232
02:07:58,320 --> 02:07:59,620
As he takes the deal.

4233
02:07:59,620 --> 02:08:02,320
I'm giving you the bingo guarantee that I won't fold again, okay?

4234
02:08:02,440 --> 02:08:03,700
That's the last time I'm folding.

4235
02:08:03,860 --> 02:08:05,400
You have nothing left to fold, bro.

4236
02:08:05,480 --> 02:08:06,660
I got a yellow.

4237
02:08:06,880 --> 02:08:07,460
I got a yellow.

4238
02:08:08,540 --> 02:08:09,720
Wait, you got the last yellow.

4239
02:08:10,700 --> 02:08:11,100
Okay.

4240
02:08:11,100 --> 02:08:11,420
Okay.

4241
02:08:11,440 --> 02:08:11,960
Maybe that's good.

4242
02:08:12,280 --> 02:08:12,680
Yes.

4243
02:08:12,680 --> 02:08:13,920
Yes, I can.

4244
02:08:14,020 --> 02:08:14,640
What do you mean?

4245
02:08:14,680 --> 02:08:15,160
I'm not that...

4246
02:08:15,620 --> 02:08:17,400
Oh, dude, you barely can.

4247
02:08:17,480 --> 02:08:17,960
Yeah, barely.

4248
02:08:18,240 --> 02:08:18,760
I'm doing it.

4249
02:08:18,820 --> 02:08:21,380
Oh, this guy has $8.

4250
02:08:21,700 --> 02:08:22,320
I'm doing it.

4251
02:08:22,980 --> 02:08:25,360
I'm doing it.

4252
02:08:25,860 --> 02:08:26,280
Send me to jail.

4253
02:08:26,280 --> 02:08:29,040
He's going to land on a space and then he's going to go bankrupt.

4254
02:08:29,440 --> 02:08:29,600
That's good.

4255
02:08:29,660 --> 02:08:30,560
That's all good.

4256
02:08:30,660 --> 02:08:30,900
That's all good.

4257
02:08:33,180 --> 02:08:33,620
$200.

4258
02:08:33,980 --> 02:08:35,780
He got your $200 back.

4259
02:08:36,180 --> 02:08:36,760
Oh, yeah.

4260
02:08:36,980 --> 02:08:37,640
Oh, yeah.

4261
02:08:37,880 --> 02:08:38,860
What do I do?

4262
02:08:39,720 --> 02:08:41,960
What happened to my dice on the side?

4263
02:08:42,160 --> 02:08:42,340
Six.

4264
02:08:42,380 --> 02:08:42,700
Wait a minute.

4265
02:08:43,240 --> 02:08:44,720
Hey, my railroad.

4266
02:08:45,680 --> 02:08:46,440
Oh, no.

4267
02:08:46,880 --> 02:08:48,860
Dude, this railroad is paying out for me.

4268
02:08:48,920 --> 02:08:49,500
It really is.

4269
02:08:50,520 --> 02:08:51,340
Railroads are nice.

4270
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:53,180
Oh, boy.

4271
02:08:54,760 --> 02:08:55,200
Okay.

4272
02:08:56,280 --> 02:08:56,420
Um...

4273
02:08:58,220 --> 02:08:59,540
Dude, what do I even need here?

4274
02:08:59,580 --> 02:09:00,180
Like a three?

4275
02:09:01,560 --> 02:09:02,000
Don't fold.

4276
02:09:02,080 --> 02:09:05,320
You have one way to redeem this.

4277
02:09:06,800 --> 02:09:08,820
I said I wouldn't fold again, though, brother.

4278
02:09:08,960 --> 02:09:09,740
I said I wouldn't fold.

4279
02:09:09,760 --> 02:09:11,520
You're literally not folding.

4280
02:09:11,780 --> 02:09:14,400
Okay, I'm going to buy this thing for the good of the nation.

4281
02:09:14,680 --> 02:09:15,660
For the good of the nation.

4282
02:09:15,760 --> 02:09:17,060
And I'm going to give you a great deal.

4283
02:09:18,520 --> 02:09:19,240
Oh, man.

4284
02:09:19,740 --> 02:09:20,280
What's the deal?

4285
02:09:21,800 --> 02:09:22,480
What's the deal, man?

4286
02:09:22,900 --> 02:09:23,860
So, I'll tell you what.

4287
02:09:23,920 --> 02:09:24,580
I need that orange.

4288
02:09:25,800 --> 02:09:27,100
I need that orange real quick.

4289
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:29,680
And then I'll give you...

4290
02:09:30,560 --> 02:09:30,940
Okay?

4291
02:09:31,640 --> 02:09:32,960
You want the yellow or the pink?

4292
02:09:33,180 --> 02:09:34,000
I want the...

4293
02:09:36,400 --> 02:09:39,060
How about the yellow and the pink?

4294
02:09:39,180 --> 02:09:39,800
How about the yellow and the pink?

4295
02:09:39,800 --> 02:09:40,580
Yeah, just get both.

4296
02:09:41,480 --> 02:09:43,300
I'll do you even better.

4297
02:09:43,780 --> 02:09:45,360
I'll prove that I'm a good business partner.

4298
02:09:45,440 --> 02:09:46,200
I'll give you the yellow pink.

4299
02:09:47,100 --> 02:09:50,400
And I'll even throw in a solid $30.

4300
02:09:50,840 --> 02:09:51,240
$30?

4301
02:09:51,720 --> 02:09:52,540
Dude, how's that?

4302
02:09:52,960 --> 02:09:53,360
Exactly.

4303
02:09:55,560 --> 02:09:56,020
And you know what?

4304
02:09:56,340 --> 02:09:59,260
I just did that for show because it's actually going to be $47.

4305
02:09:59,720 --> 02:10:00,980
Ask for the railroad, too.

4306
02:10:01,280 --> 02:10:02,580
Yeah, ask for the railroad.

4307
02:10:02,720 --> 02:10:03,320
Ask for the railroad.

4308
02:10:04,520 --> 02:10:08,140
Because it's been 47 spaces since we started our alliance.

4309
02:10:08,260 --> 02:10:09,960
This is our anniversary gift.

4310
02:10:10,620 --> 02:10:12,100
You can't say no to this deal.

4311
02:10:12,260 --> 02:10:12,700
You just can't.

4312
02:10:13,760 --> 02:10:14,560
$400 value.

4313
02:10:15,800 --> 02:10:16,200
$47.

4314
02:10:16,820 --> 02:10:18,400
Ask for the railroad, too.

4315
02:10:20,620 --> 02:10:22,100
You would give the railroad.

4316
02:10:22,560 --> 02:10:24,340
You're getting double the value here already.

4317
02:10:24,400 --> 02:10:24,940
It's a loan.

4318
02:10:25,960 --> 02:10:27,140
You know what?

4319
02:10:27,320 --> 02:10:28,880
This is my business partner right here.

4320
02:10:30,220 --> 02:10:31,100
Anniversary gift.

4321
02:10:31,220 --> 02:10:32,140
You're getting double the value.

4322
02:10:32,220 --> 02:10:33,280
Anniversary gift?

4323
02:10:33,300 --> 02:10:33,760
He's thoughtful.

4324
02:10:34,220 --> 02:10:34,580
I'll tell you what.

4325
02:10:34,680 --> 02:10:35,880
Doki wants that pink.

4326
02:10:36,300 --> 02:10:36,600
True!

4327
02:10:38,480 --> 02:10:40,340
Anything to piss off Doki.

4328
02:10:40,680 --> 02:10:41,820
Anything to piss off Doki.

4329
02:10:42,520 --> 02:10:44,980
Anything to piss off Doki is what I'm going to do.

4330
02:10:45,200 --> 02:10:45,600
Yeah, dude.

4331
02:10:45,700 --> 02:10:49,420
The funny thing is I actually misclicked and didn't enter the money on accident.

4332
02:10:51,060 --> 02:10:52,960
I just realized I misclicked.

4333
02:10:53,020 --> 02:10:53,820
You didn't even get the money.

4334
02:10:53,840 --> 02:10:55,100
You just got scammed.

4335
02:10:55,540 --> 02:10:58,060
You just got scammed.

4336
02:10:58,680 --> 02:11:00,080
Well, it's actually a misclick.

4337
02:11:00,160 --> 02:11:00,980
The UI is cooked.

4338
02:11:01,060 --> 02:11:02,520
You know the UI is cooked.

4339
02:11:04,600 --> 02:11:05,940
Stop buying houses.

4340
02:11:06,680 --> 02:11:07,620
Houses on houses.

4341
02:11:07,880 --> 02:11:10,840
He laughed, too, so you know you enjoyed that scam.

4342
02:11:11,480 --> 02:11:12,360
Alright, alright.

4343
02:11:12,780 --> 02:11:14,480
There ain't no way, bro.

4344
02:11:14,580 --> 02:11:15,440
There ain't no way.

4345
02:11:15,520 --> 02:11:16,420
You got double the value.

4346
02:11:16,420 --> 02:11:18,960
Yeah, I got double the value because then you scammed my ass.

4347
02:11:19,120 --> 02:11:20,040
What do you mean, bro?

4348
02:11:20,340 --> 02:11:21,260
What do you mean?

4349
02:11:21,640 --> 02:11:22,360
I'll tell you what.

4350
02:11:22,400 --> 02:11:24,560
You land on the properties, I don't charge you a cent, bro.

4351
02:11:24,560 --> 02:11:26,180
If you didn't offer it, then you wouldn't have felt scammed.

4352
02:11:26,180 --> 02:11:28,340
I don't charge you a cent if you land on the properties.

4353
02:11:28,460 --> 02:11:29,060
I'll tell you what.

4354
02:11:29,140 --> 02:11:30,680
You can't make that decision.

4355
02:11:30,840 --> 02:11:31,680
You barely own it.

4356
02:11:32,380 --> 02:11:33,300
You don't lose any.

4357
02:11:34,120 --> 02:11:35,220
It's the last one.

4358
02:11:36,340 --> 02:11:37,400
It's the last one.

4359
02:11:37,880 --> 02:11:40,920
Dang it, I should have kept something saying, trade with Doki for the pink.

4360
02:11:41,560 --> 02:11:42,820
Ellum, trade that pink for the railroad.

4361
02:11:43,760 --> 02:11:45,300
Yeah, I'm winning the auction.

4362
02:11:45,300 --> 02:11:46,580
I'm winning the auction.

4363
02:11:46,960 --> 02:11:47,900
I'm winning the auction.

4364
02:11:49,300 --> 02:11:50,180
Oh, shit.

4365
02:11:50,400 --> 02:11:51,920
Dude, you're auctioning this?

4366
02:11:52,700 --> 02:11:54,100
Ellum, we need to win this, dude.

4367
02:11:54,520 --> 02:11:55,900
Dude, what do you mean, we?

4368
02:11:56,100 --> 02:11:57,520
What do you mean, we?

4369
02:11:57,760 --> 02:12:01,380
What do you mean, we here, brother?

4370
02:12:01,440 --> 02:12:03,340
We need this for the good of the nation, Ellum.

4371
02:12:03,360 --> 02:12:03,840
Then bid.

4372
02:12:03,980 --> 02:12:05,700
You can't bid on this.

4373
02:12:05,940 --> 02:12:06,380
No.

4374
02:12:09,640 --> 02:12:11,920
Why would you instantly go to 100?

4375
02:12:12,020 --> 02:12:12,800
At least make me think.

4376
02:12:12,820 --> 02:12:13,800
I think I have a chance.

4377
02:12:14,040 --> 02:12:16,060
At least give me like a little bit of hope.

4378
02:12:16,120 --> 02:12:19,320
It's perfect because Ellum can't bet on it.

4379
02:12:19,360 --> 02:12:19,620
I can't either.

4380
02:12:19,620 --> 02:12:20,740
I literally can't either, dude.

4381
02:12:20,880 --> 02:12:21,380
Oh my god.

4382
02:12:22,480 --> 02:12:24,940
So, Huynh, what would you trade for that railroad out of Kyrios?

4383
02:12:26,860 --> 02:12:30,260
Wait, Ellum, if you can rip that one yellow from Huynh, that would be...

4384
02:12:30,260 --> 02:12:33,280
Oh, he's gonna have to work really hard to get that from me.

4385
02:12:33,460 --> 02:12:35,080
Come on now, Huynh.

4386
02:12:35,300 --> 02:12:36,200
Huynh, come on.

4387
02:12:36,200 --> 02:12:38,000
Dude, you'll have triple yellow on that Ellum.

4388
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:38,780
Huynh, what do you need from me?

4389
02:12:38,780 --> 02:12:39,420
What do you need?

4390
02:12:39,420 --> 02:12:39,880
What do you need?

4391
02:12:39,900 --> 02:12:42,600
Look, I'm open for suggestions, you know, whatever you need.

4392
02:12:43,920 --> 02:12:46,120
Came out a game as well, you know, you want me to...

4393
02:12:46,120 --> 02:12:49,200
I can play some embarrassing song with me singing, I can do...

4394
02:12:49,200 --> 02:12:50,380
Whatever you need, you know?

4395
02:12:50,840 --> 02:12:51,440
Whatever you need.

4396
02:12:51,640 --> 02:12:53,860
I don't know if she wants to pay money for that.

4397
02:12:53,960 --> 02:12:57,220
I don't know if that increases the value.

4398
02:12:57,720 --> 02:12:58,940
Six bucks to Doki.

4399
02:12:59,020 --> 02:13:00,520
I don't think she wants money.

4400
02:13:00,660 --> 02:13:02,140
I think she wants more than that.

4401
02:13:02,600 --> 02:13:05,000
Somebody lands on this orange and I call it a day.

4402
02:13:05,000 --> 02:13:06,780
Roll a, what, like a 3-4?

4403
02:13:06,880 --> 02:13:07,400
3-4?

4404
02:13:07,480 --> 02:13:08,040
3-4?

4405
02:13:08,060 --> 02:13:08,440
3-4?

4406
02:13:08,460 --> 02:13:08,780
3-4?

4407
02:13:08,820 --> 02:13:08,820
3 -4?

4408
02:13:08,840 --> 02:13:09,180
3-4?

4409
02:13:09,180 --> 02:13:09,380
3-4?

4410
02:13:09,380 --> 02:13:09,380
3-4?

4411
02:13:09,380 --> 02:13:09,380
3-4?

4412
02:13:09,380 --> 02:13:09,380
3-4?

4413
02:13:09,420 --> 02:13:10,220
Come on, 3 or 4?

4414
02:13:10,280 --> 02:13:10,640
3 or 4?

4415
02:13:10,780 --> 02:13:11,560
Dang it, dang it.

4416
02:13:12,420 --> 02:13:15,480
I mean, I don't know where I am, but...

4417
02:13:16,180 --> 02:13:16,620
Oh, hey!

4418
02:13:18,320 --> 02:13:18,960
36 buckaroos!

4419
02:13:19,620 --> 02:13:21,760
Oh, it's because it's doubled because she has all three.

4420
02:13:22,040 --> 02:13:23,020
You have all three.

4421
02:13:23,700 --> 02:13:24,740
Yeah, that's kind of crazy.

4422
02:13:26,420 --> 02:13:27,400
The houses are good.

4423
02:13:27,440 --> 02:13:29,180
I wonder who did that, Sykkuno.

4424
02:13:29,700 --> 02:13:31,300
Who gave me all those reds?

4425
02:13:31,360 --> 02:13:31,420
A two!

4426
02:13:31,640 --> 02:13:31,940
A two!

4427
02:13:32,040 --> 02:13:32,820
Wait, oh, it's him.

4428
02:13:32,920 --> 02:13:33,920
God damn it, man.

4429
02:13:35,320 --> 02:13:36,880
I want to... I got to go to prison.

4430
02:13:37,000 --> 02:13:37,540
I got to go to prison.

4431
02:13:37,880 --> 02:13:38,200
Surely.

4432
02:13:39,460 --> 02:13:40,220
Maybe it's time.

4433
02:13:40,560 --> 02:13:41,820
Yeah, I need to go to jail.

4434
02:13:41,920 --> 02:13:43,880
I don't want to go below 200 bucks here.

4435
02:13:45,100 --> 02:13:45,500
A three?

4436
02:13:46,320 --> 02:13:47,340
Then I lose money.

4437
02:13:47,560 --> 02:13:47,920
That's great.

4438
02:13:48,320 --> 02:13:51,300
Guys, I can't give Doki the other pink because there's nothing else I need, bro.

4439
02:13:51,380 --> 02:13:52,260
That would be absolutely devastating.

4440
02:13:52,260 --> 02:13:52,800
I just need money.

4441
02:13:53,220 --> 02:13:56,400
I would give Doki the other pink if she had a shitload of money she could just give me.

4442
02:13:56,400 --> 02:13:57,500
But I need money, bro.

4443
02:13:57,880 --> 02:13:58,640
I need money.

4444
02:13:59,620 --> 02:14:01,340
Oh, everybody's so poor now.

4445
02:14:01,480 --> 02:14:02,600
I know, it's bad.

4446
02:14:02,920 --> 02:14:04,440
Doki, please, please, please, please.

4447
02:14:05,100 --> 02:14:05,720
Please, cringe.

4448
02:14:06,360 --> 02:14:07,640
Everybody's so poor.

4449
02:14:07,660 --> 02:14:08,420
Wait, she lands on tax.

4450
02:14:08,860 --> 02:14:09,300
Tax.

4451
02:14:09,440 --> 02:14:09,960
Big tax.

4452
02:14:10,140 --> 02:14:11,340
Wait, that's... oh.

4453
02:14:11,900 --> 02:14:12,620
Is that tax?

4454
02:14:12,820 --> 02:14:15,040
Wait, but she gains 200 anyway, so she's... oh.

4455
02:14:15,100 --> 02:14:16,060
That's 200 bucks.

4456
02:14:16,140 --> 02:14:17,120
She loses 200.

4457
02:14:17,420 --> 02:14:17,860
No.

4458
02:14:18,920 --> 02:14:19,460
That's kind of a thing.

4459
02:14:19,460 --> 02:14:22,580
Dude, at least she didn't land on... look at those two houses on Hyun's property right there.

4460
02:14:22,620 --> 02:14:23,520
That would have been devastating.

4461
02:14:24,600 --> 02:14:25,040
Devastating.

4462
02:14:25,360 --> 02:14:26,600
She was one off.

4463
02:14:26,860 --> 02:14:28,100
Holy moly.

4464
02:14:28,300 --> 02:14:28,500
Let's see.

4465
02:14:28,760 --> 02:14:30,600
Wait, nobody has a green yet.

4466
02:14:31,940 --> 02:14:33,200
Yeah, that's kind of crazy.

4467
02:14:33,200 --> 02:14:34,180
Yeah, what the heck?

4468
02:14:34,540 --> 02:14:36,180
Yeah, nobody owns a green.

4469
02:14:36,340 --> 02:14:37,200
Please don't land on this orange.

4470
02:14:37,220 --> 02:14:38,460
I'm actually going to cry if I land on it.

4471
02:14:38,520 --> 02:14:39,620
I will actually have a breakdown.

4472
02:14:40,180 --> 02:14:40,580
No.

4473
02:14:40,740 --> 02:14:41,140
No.

4474
02:14:41,420 --> 02:14:42,480
Why are you celebrating?

4475
02:14:44,340 --> 02:14:45,020
That's an orange.

4476
02:14:45,440 --> 02:14:47,220
Wow, you aren't brown.

4477
02:14:47,260 --> 02:14:49,520
No, he promised me 50% of the...

4478
02:14:49,520 --> 02:14:51,800
Give me 100 bucks plus the 47 bucks you owe me.

4479
02:14:52,740 --> 02:14:54,340
If he doesn't do that...

4480
02:14:54,340 --> 02:14:54,700
What?

4481
02:14:54,700 --> 02:14:55,540
Okay, yeah.

4482
02:14:55,660 --> 02:14:56,340
Trade me.

4483
02:14:56,360 --> 02:14:57,180
Trade me for the...

4484
02:14:57,180 --> 02:14:59,480
You said 147 bucks.

4485
02:15:00,060 --> 02:15:00,460
147.

4486
02:15:00,900 --> 02:15:01,300
147.

4487
02:15:01,380 --> 02:15:02,040
147 bucks.

4488
02:15:02,060 --> 02:15:02,700
147 bucks.

4489
02:15:02,780 --> 02:15:03,180
We'll call it a day.

4490
02:15:03,200 --> 02:15:04,020
Okay, okay.

4491
02:15:04,480 --> 02:15:04,800
50%.

4492
02:15:04,800 --> 02:15:05,820
Remember, business partners.

4493
02:15:06,040 --> 02:15:06,360
Or...

4494
02:15:06,360 --> 02:15:08,520
Or, I've got an idea.

4495
02:15:08,680 --> 02:15:09,220
Better idea.

4496
02:15:09,640 --> 02:15:10,160
Round it up.

4497
02:15:10,320 --> 02:15:11,340
You don't take the money now.

4498
02:15:11,440 --> 02:15:12,320
I buy two more houses.

4499
02:15:12,400 --> 02:15:16,040
And when they land on it, I'll give you double of what I owe you now.

4500
02:15:16,080 --> 02:15:16,500
You'll get 300.

4501
02:15:18,020 --> 02:15:19,440
You let me buy the houses to make more money.

4502
02:15:19,440 --> 02:15:20,480
You take that deal, you're a chump.

4503
02:15:20,740 --> 02:15:22,540
You let me take this money, okay?

4504
02:15:22,800 --> 02:15:25,440
You let me take this money, I buy two more houses, right?

4505
02:15:25,500 --> 02:15:26,900
They land on it, and you get 300.

4506
02:15:26,900 --> 02:15:29,460
But I get that anyway because you said I get 50% regardless.

4507
02:15:30,060 --> 02:15:31,240
Yeah, but I can't buy the houses.

4508
02:15:31,680 --> 02:15:32,000
See?

4509
02:15:32,100 --> 02:15:32,940
I can't buy the houses.

4510
02:15:33,200 --> 02:15:33,840
You take this money now.

4511
02:15:34,120 --> 02:15:36,180
Okay, good point, good point, good point.

4512
02:15:36,480 --> 02:15:38,540
You leave me with this money, I buy those houses.

4513
02:15:38,700 --> 02:15:40,280
Somebody else lands on it.

4514
02:15:40,980 --> 02:15:42,520
$300, you doubled your money.

4515
02:15:42,580 --> 02:15:43,740
How else are you gonna double your money in this game?

4516
02:15:43,740 --> 02:15:45,360
How else am I gonna buy houses on my own properties?

4517
02:15:45,800 --> 02:15:46,820
It makes simply sense.

4518
02:15:48,560 --> 02:15:49,680
Who wouldn't take that deal?

4519
02:15:50,620 --> 02:15:52,800
There's no other way you double your money that quick.

4520
02:15:53,040 --> 02:15:53,880
There's just no other way.

4521
02:15:53,940 --> 02:15:55,180
You can pass go, you only get 200.

4522
02:15:55,420 --> 02:15:56,220
You know what's gonna be funny?

4523
02:15:56,760 --> 02:15:58,580
Is LM gonna go bankrupt first?

4524
02:15:59,520 --> 02:16:01,660
Or you're gonna be able to buy the house?

4525
02:16:03,380 --> 02:16:04,460
I'm gonna be fine.

4526
02:16:04,760 --> 02:16:06,620
Oh, thank god I'm in jail.

4527
02:16:06,840 --> 02:16:07,380
Thank god.

4528
02:16:08,500 --> 02:16:09,640
Yeah, that's good.

4529
02:16:10,680 --> 02:16:12,980
$74 as well, bro, is nuts.

4530
02:16:13,220 --> 02:16:13,400
This is good.

4531
02:16:15,360 --> 02:16:15,840
$74.

4532
02:16:16,440 --> 02:16:18,620
Dude, LM, this is so good for us.

4533
02:16:19,060 --> 02:16:19,800
Let's play.

4534
02:16:20,080 --> 02:16:23,380
This is potentially the best situation we've ever been in.

4535
02:16:23,880 --> 02:16:24,640
LM, I'll...

4536
02:16:25,400 --> 02:16:26,540
I'll give you a green.

4537
02:16:26,920 --> 02:16:29,660
And $100 if you give me the light blue.

4538
02:16:30,160 --> 02:16:31,060
What is this?

4539
02:16:31,060 --> 02:16:32,540
Give me the green plus $100.

4540
02:16:33,240 --> 02:16:33,680
Yeah.

4541
02:16:34,780 --> 02:16:35,220
$22?

4542
02:16:37,040 --> 02:16:38,240
The light blue.

4543
02:16:39,440 --> 02:16:41,300
Okay, but I need a bit more money than that, though.

4544
02:16:41,320 --> 02:16:42,520
I need a bit more doki.

4545
02:16:42,580 --> 02:16:43,280
I rolled doubles?

4546
02:16:43,400 --> 02:16:45,840
Yeah, but that's more than what Sykuno gave you, which was zero.

4547
02:16:46,060 --> 02:16:47,780
Dude, I'm getting juiced out, bro.

4548
02:16:48,960 --> 02:16:50,140
That's money, baby!

4549
02:16:50,440 --> 02:16:51,680
Getting juiced out by money.

4550
02:16:51,800 --> 02:16:52,240
That's money!

4551
02:16:53,140 --> 02:16:54,820
I gave you this property.

4552
02:16:55,780 --> 02:16:56,220
Okay.

4553
02:16:57,840 --> 02:16:59,040
Wait, I only got $36?

4554
02:16:59,440 --> 02:17:00,100
Wait a second.

4555
02:17:00,200 --> 02:17:00,900
I need my money.

4556
02:17:01,520 --> 02:17:02,240
We're all poor.

4557
02:17:03,360 --> 02:17:05,080
Yeah, we don't have money.

4558
02:17:05,380 --> 02:17:05,900
Wait a second.

4559
02:17:05,900 --> 02:17:06,240
Please!

4560
02:17:06,880 --> 02:17:08,040
Did you buy any houses?

4561
02:17:08,040 --> 02:17:09,520
I did, brother.

4562
02:17:09,840 --> 02:17:11,040
You didn't buy any houses, did you?

4563
02:17:12,720 --> 02:17:15,260
Dude, LM, what happened to not charging each other?

4564
02:17:15,560 --> 02:17:15,960
Yes!

4565
02:17:17,180 --> 02:17:18,100
Oh my god!

4566
02:17:19,000 --> 02:17:20,500
Oh my god!

4567
02:17:20,980 --> 02:17:22,360
I don't owe you a cent.

4568
02:17:22,720 --> 02:17:24,600
I don't owe you a cent anymore, man.

4569
02:17:26,220 --> 02:17:27,120
I don't owe you anything now.

4570
02:17:27,160 --> 02:17:28,020
You're paid back.

4571
02:17:28,360 --> 02:17:29,700
You're paid back, man.

4572
02:17:29,780 --> 02:17:32,280
Give me my money, bro.

4573
02:17:32,500 --> 02:17:34,660
You are extremely paid back now.

4574
02:17:34,680 --> 02:17:35,660
I call it even.

4575
02:17:35,760 --> 02:17:37,920
Dude, you are a scammer.

4576
02:17:37,980 --> 02:17:38,800
There's no way.

4577
02:17:39,520 --> 02:17:40,900
There's actually no way.

4578
02:17:41,100 --> 02:17:41,860
You call me a scammer?

4579
02:17:44,720 --> 02:17:46,660
$200 right off the bat right there.

4580
02:17:46,720 --> 02:17:46,900
$200?

4581
02:17:47,180 --> 02:17:50,020
You owe me $147, you dick.

4582
02:17:50,200 --> 02:17:50,780
What do you mean?

4583
02:17:50,860 --> 02:17:53,760
Which means you got an extra $60.

4584
02:17:54,160 --> 02:17:55,520
What a bargain that was.

4585
02:17:57,080 --> 02:17:58,900
I would never scam you, LM.

4586
02:17:59,100 --> 02:17:59,880
Yes, you would.

4587
02:18:00,700 --> 02:18:01,480
I would never.

4588
02:18:01,660 --> 02:18:03,760
I've given you good deals throughout it.

4589
02:18:03,780 --> 02:18:07,380
I want you to know in my entire chat, the moment I agreed to your deal, everyone just started spamming rolled.

4590
02:18:08,360 --> 02:18:08,760
Sorry.

4591
02:18:10,700 --> 02:18:15,240
All I'm saying, my value is $320 for the green.

4592
02:18:15,260 --> 02:18:15,400
All I'm saying, my value is $320 for the green.

4593
02:18:15,400 --> 02:18:16,280
I need money as well, Doki.

4594
02:18:16,280 --> 02:18:17,320
I need money as well.

4595
02:18:18,080 --> 02:18:19,200
You need money?

4596
02:18:19,220 --> 02:18:20,540
I need money as well.

4597
02:18:20,680 --> 02:18:21,720
Alright, I'll give you money too.

4598
02:18:21,720 --> 02:18:25,860
And if you put like $1, I'm insta-rejecting.

4599
02:18:25,860 --> 02:18:28,060
I don't take any offers under $100.

4600
02:18:28,440 --> 02:18:29,520
$100 minimum.

4601
02:18:30,540 --> 02:18:31,540
$100 minimum?

4602
02:18:32,280 --> 02:18:33,080
Plus the property.

4603
02:18:33,160 --> 02:18:34,360
How about like $50?

4604
02:18:34,980 --> 02:18:35,440
No, no, no.

4605
02:18:35,560 --> 02:18:37,200
We're only talking $100 in this house.

4606
02:18:37,600 --> 02:18:38,780
How about $50?

4607
02:18:39,780 --> 02:18:41,040
How about $100?

4608
02:18:41,240 --> 02:18:42,880
What do you even want the green for?

4609
02:18:43,100 --> 02:18:44,680
It's not like it's gonna...

4610
02:18:44,680 --> 02:18:47,600
The green is the potential to get two other...

4611
02:18:47,600 --> 02:18:50,460
The green is the only one that has no prop.

4612
02:18:50,460 --> 02:18:52,360
That has no one else claiming it.

4613
02:18:52,700 --> 02:18:53,180
Yeah.

4614
02:18:54,580 --> 02:18:55,700
It's $1,400.

4615
02:18:56,120 --> 02:18:59,380
I mean, Ellum, you'll have two dark blues.

4616
02:18:59,640 --> 02:19:01,380
That's a very, very lucky already.

4617
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:05,040
What I need right now, Doki, I'm gonna be honest, is just money.

4618
02:19:05,180 --> 02:19:05,740
I just need money.

4619
02:19:06,140 --> 02:19:07,660
I just need some big...

4620
02:19:08,280 --> 02:19:08,920
50 bucks.

4621
02:19:09,680 --> 02:19:10,640
50 bucks.

4622
02:19:10,900 --> 02:19:11,500
Okay, how about this?

4623
02:19:12,080 --> 02:19:13,100
I'll give you the blue.

4624
02:19:13,220 --> 02:19:16,900
If you give me the pinks.

4625
02:19:18,840 --> 02:19:19,800
Both pinks?

4626
02:19:21,220 --> 02:19:22,620
I want both pinks.

4627
02:19:22,620 --> 02:19:23,060
I want both pinks for the blue.

4628
02:19:23,120 --> 02:19:24,420
This is my only deal.

4629
02:19:24,760 --> 02:19:26,260
Ellum, there's no way this makes sense.

4630
02:19:26,420 --> 02:19:27,880
This isn't even a fold at this point.

4631
02:19:27,980 --> 02:19:30,140
This is $370 to $120.

4632
02:19:30,980 --> 02:19:32,560
That's already double the money.

4633
02:19:33,540 --> 02:19:35,740
Doki, I accept your offer.

4634
02:19:36,460 --> 02:19:37,820
Doki, I accept it.

4635
02:19:37,860 --> 02:19:43,760
All I'm saying is that Sykkuno has fucked you over with money, but I actually put money in the deal.

4636
02:19:43,760 --> 02:19:44,600
Doki, Doki, Doki, Doki.

4637
02:19:45,860 --> 02:19:49,360
I actually, I believe and I think this is a good offer.

4638
02:19:50,460 --> 02:19:51,980
This is what I would say if I wasn't an idiot.

4639
02:19:52,280 --> 02:19:52,620
No.

4640
02:19:52,720 --> 02:19:53,860
Get refused.

4641
02:19:55,100 --> 02:19:55,580
No.

4642
02:19:55,760 --> 02:19:56,940
Get rejected.

4643
02:19:56,960 --> 02:20:01,220
Can I trade you my green for your yellow?

4644
02:20:02,100 --> 02:20:03,960
Yeah, you can have my yellow.

4645
02:20:04,200 --> 02:20:04,720
No, no, no.

4646
02:20:06,840 --> 02:20:07,800
Ellum, don't.

4647
02:20:08,020 --> 02:20:08,880
Don't do it.

4648
02:20:09,020 --> 02:20:11,020
Ellum, don't put me in this position.

4649
02:20:11,260 --> 02:20:14,140
Ellum, this is stupid.

4650
02:20:14,420 --> 02:20:15,740
Just say no and walk away.

4651
02:20:16,200 --> 02:20:17,680
This isn't me.

4652
02:20:17,820 --> 02:20:18,900
This isn't me.

4653
02:20:19,020 --> 02:20:19,940
This isn't me, bro.

4654
02:20:20,460 --> 02:20:21,060
Ellum, just say no.

4655
02:20:21,060 --> 02:20:22,500
Wait, Doki, can I get $10?

4656
02:20:22,520 --> 02:20:23,220
Yeah, of course.

4657
02:20:24,740 --> 02:20:26,600
How do I do this?

4658
02:20:27,240 --> 02:20:28,520
Ellum, just say no, bro.

4659
02:20:28,680 --> 02:20:29,780
Just say no.

4660
02:20:29,960 --> 02:20:30,960
That's all you gotta do.

4661
02:20:31,120 --> 02:20:31,900
It ain't that crazy.

4662
02:20:32,140 --> 02:20:33,800
It ain't that crazy, Ellum.

4663
02:20:33,800 --> 02:20:35,320
Just be like, nah, I ain't interested.

4664
02:20:35,840 --> 02:20:38,540
I ain't interested in your snake oil salesman.

4665
02:20:40,300 --> 02:20:41,040
I ain't interested.

4666
02:20:41,060 --> 02:20:41,980
Oh, sorry, I messed that up.

4667
02:20:43,700 --> 02:20:45,480
Wait a second, Hyun, you don't need to accept this.

4668
02:20:45,480 --> 02:20:47,260
Make the deal with me.

4669
02:20:47,420 --> 02:20:49,980
Make the deal with me, Hyun.

4670
02:20:50,720 --> 02:20:51,660
Oh, man.

4671
02:20:51,660 --> 02:20:54,340
Now you have to make the deal with her.

4672
02:20:54,740 --> 02:20:55,880
Wait a second.

4673
02:20:55,900 --> 02:20:56,140
Wait a second now.

4674
02:20:57,000 --> 02:20:59,400
Wait a second now.

4675
02:20:59,940 --> 02:21:01,140
Okay, okay.

4676
02:21:01,600 --> 02:21:05,900
Um, well, uh, Doki, what are you thinking here?

4677
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:06,740
What are you, um...

4678
02:21:08,320 --> 02:21:09,520
What are you, uh...

4679
02:21:09,520 --> 02:21:10,520
What are you thinking right now?

4680
02:21:11,080 --> 02:21:12,700
Yeah, you want the yellow, right?

4681
02:21:13,460 --> 02:21:15,020
I mean, I would love the yellow.

4682
02:21:15,380 --> 02:21:17,020
You love the yellow, right?

4683
02:21:17,060 --> 02:21:18,640
I would really like the yellow, I'm not gonna lie.

4684
02:21:19,200 --> 02:21:20,180
Ellum, what happened to don't fold, bro?

4685
02:21:20,180 --> 02:21:22,580
You have to trade her the blue and the pink.

4686
02:21:22,820 --> 02:21:23,780
Yeah, that's what I'm thinking.

4687
02:21:23,780 --> 02:21:25,400
You think I'm doing both?

4688
02:21:25,500 --> 02:21:26,880
Ellum, you ain't taking this deal, are you?

4689
02:21:27,000 --> 02:21:29,220
You don't take this.

4690
02:21:30,340 --> 02:21:32,660
Oh, and a hundred dollars, don't you?

4691
02:21:32,720 --> 02:21:34,760
Oh, and a hundred dollars?

4692
02:21:34,760 --> 02:21:35,380
And a hundred dollars.

4693
02:21:36,580 --> 02:21:38,700
You give me the yellow, I give you the light blue.

4694
02:21:39,040 --> 02:21:39,360
Right?

4695
02:21:39,480 --> 02:21:40,340
And we take away the money.

4696
02:21:40,460 --> 02:21:41,600
No, I only take two cards.

4697
02:21:42,700 --> 02:21:43,840
I'm holding the yellow.

4698
02:21:44,280 --> 02:21:46,620
Then I guess you're taking no properties.

4699
02:21:46,780 --> 02:21:47,980
Then how about you're taking no then?

4700
02:21:48,080 --> 02:21:48,460
Zero.

4701
02:21:48,980 --> 02:21:49,380
Zilch.

4702
02:21:49,380 --> 02:21:49,740
Nothing.

4703
02:21:50,060 --> 02:21:52,240
She's gonna land on the orange and she's gonna need the money.

4704
02:21:52,320 --> 02:21:53,300
She's gonna need the money.

4705
02:21:54,040 --> 02:21:56,720
She'll be forced to sell it at cheap.

4706
02:21:56,880 --> 02:21:57,340
Thank you.

4707
02:21:57,400 --> 02:21:58,220
And I'll sell it to Hyun.

4708
02:22:01,900 --> 02:22:03,180
But Hyun's got no money.

4709
02:22:04,240 --> 02:22:05,520
You can't sell it to her.

4710
02:22:06,160 --> 02:22:06,840
She's got nothing.

4711
02:22:08,280 --> 02:22:10,540
She's in jail, she will accumulate the wealth.

4712
02:22:11,120 --> 02:22:12,200
Shit, she's got a point.

4713
02:22:12,700 --> 02:22:13,840
I don't know if anyone lands on her stuff.

4714
02:22:13,980 --> 02:22:17,040
And she only, as of right now, Hyun only has brown.

4715
02:22:17,940 --> 02:22:18,380
Right?

4716
02:22:18,500 --> 02:22:19,400
Just think about it.

4717
02:22:19,400 --> 02:22:21,400
I have your last railroad sequel.

4718
02:22:21,720 --> 02:22:23,000
You ain't farming too much.

4719
02:22:23,100 --> 02:22:25,680
I can ask Hyun for the last railroad too.

4720
02:22:27,160 --> 02:22:28,820
Wait, what does Hyun have?

4721
02:22:28,920 --> 02:22:30,740
An additional backpack slot for you?

4722
02:22:30,820 --> 02:22:32,140
What the fuck is this?

4723
02:22:32,660 --> 02:22:34,280
Ellum, there's no way you accept this deal.

4724
02:22:34,340 --> 02:22:36,320
She's gonna have three monopolies with this.

4725
02:22:36,420 --> 02:22:37,220
Now doki doki doki.

4726
02:22:37,780 --> 02:22:40,260
She's gonna have more monopolies than the rest of the entire game.

4727
02:22:40,260 --> 02:22:43,500
Every time you land on my space, I'll give you back the money that you pay me.

4728
02:22:44,120 --> 02:22:46,000
That's, that's, that's, that's false.

4729
02:22:48,540 --> 02:22:51,400
I'll give you back the money that you land on my spot.

4730
02:22:51,400 --> 02:22:51,860
Ellum, you know you can't take this deal.

4731
02:22:51,860 --> 02:22:52,600
You know this.

4732
02:22:56,340 --> 02:22:57,600
Just think about it.

4733
02:22:57,600 --> 02:23:00,100
Every time you land on my space, I'll give you back the money.

4734
02:23:01,580 --> 02:23:03,920
Yeah, and you know why she's gonna have to give you back the money?

4735
02:23:04,120 --> 02:23:06,760
Because she took so much from you giving her all these.

4736
02:23:07,140 --> 02:23:09,140
You don't even need to get your money back.

4737
02:23:09,140 --> 02:23:11,260
I gave you Boardwalk, Ellum.

4738
02:23:11,400 --> 02:23:14,320
Boardwalk has been, like, one of the best spaces ever.

4739
02:23:14,320 --> 02:23:14,360
She scammed you.

4740
02:23:14,360 --> 02:23:16,080
Remember what Chat said when you gave Boardwalk?

4741
02:23:16,160 --> 02:23:17,480
They said Rolled.

4742
02:23:17,480 --> 02:23:18,940
They said I was spamming Rolled.

4743
02:23:18,940 --> 02:23:20,140
And then they said...

4744
02:23:20,760 --> 02:23:23,120
They just kept shouting Rolled at me.

4745
02:23:23,840 --> 02:23:27,020
Yeah, but didn't you earn $200 from Sykuno from Boardwalk?

4746
02:23:27,100 --> 02:23:27,880
I'm rejecting this offer.

4747
02:23:28,920 --> 02:23:30,060
I'm rejecting it.

4748
02:23:31,120 --> 02:23:31,620
It's done.

4749
02:23:32,240 --> 02:23:33,060
It's been refused.

4750
02:23:33,360 --> 02:23:33,980
It's been refused.

4751
02:23:34,180 --> 02:23:35,560
Dude, she would have had three monopolies.

4752
02:23:35,560 --> 02:23:37,100
Three monopolies, doki.

4753
02:23:37,160 --> 02:23:37,920
I can't be dealing with that.

4754
02:23:39,140 --> 02:23:39,780
I can't be dealing with that.

4755
02:23:40,880 --> 02:23:42,420
She's already got the red one, man.

4756
02:23:42,420 --> 02:23:43,520
She's already got the red one.

4757
02:23:43,560 --> 02:23:44,780
It would have been straight GG.

4758
02:23:44,920 --> 02:23:46,340
I don't even have enough money to buy houses.

4759
02:23:46,580 --> 02:23:49,640
Okay, doki, save the deal for a later time.

4760
02:23:49,980 --> 02:23:50,380
You know?

4761
02:23:51,380 --> 02:23:53,120
No, I'm not making that deal again.

4762
02:23:53,240 --> 02:23:54,340
No, no, no, doki, doki, doki.

4763
02:23:54,860 --> 02:23:55,780
Doki, doki, doki.

4764
02:23:59,360 --> 02:24:00,000
Sykuno, Sykuno.

4765
02:24:00,280 --> 02:24:01,100
Wait, oh my god, I'm fine.

4766
02:24:01,180 --> 02:24:01,760
Oh my god, thank god.

4767
02:24:01,980 --> 02:24:04,900
What do you mean by dang it?

4768
02:24:05,840 --> 02:24:07,020
I said dang it.

4769
02:24:07,020 --> 02:24:08,640
You didn't land on the chance space.

4770
02:24:08,640 --> 02:24:09,280
Nothing can happen to you here.

4771
02:24:09,300 --> 02:24:13,240
If you want, I'll take the deal because of what Sykuno just said.

4772
02:24:13,540 --> 02:24:16,240
No, Sykuno owes me 147 bucks still.

4773
02:24:16,420 --> 02:24:16,960
No, Sykuno owes me 147 bucks still.

4774
02:24:16,960 --> 02:24:17,700
I don't have that money.

4775
02:24:17,780 --> 02:24:18,840
You took 200, remember?

4776
02:24:18,860 --> 02:24:19,980
That's not my fault.

4777
02:24:20,020 --> 02:24:21,880
I'm collecting my money right now.

4778
02:24:21,960 --> 02:24:22,440
That's not my fault.

4779
02:24:22,440 --> 02:24:22,820
I'm collecting my money right now.

4780
02:24:22,820 --> 02:24:24,440
I need somebody to land on my orange.

4781
02:24:24,640 --> 02:24:25,760
I'll make no money.

4782
02:24:26,000 --> 02:24:27,660
And now my chat is still saying rolled.

4783
02:24:30,180 --> 02:24:31,620
I got nothing, man.

4784
02:24:31,640 --> 02:24:34,920
If I land on a bad spot here, my keister's cooked.

4785
02:24:34,920 --> 02:24:36,740
What the fuck is a keister?

4786
02:24:37,660 --> 02:24:38,280
I don't know.

4787
02:24:38,340 --> 02:24:39,820
I heard Joey Wheeler say it in Yu-Gi-Oh.

4788
02:24:41,160 --> 02:24:42,600
Where does this land me?

4789
02:24:43,500 --> 02:24:44,440
Okay, 200 bucks.

4790
02:24:44,520 --> 02:24:45,780
200 buckaroos.

4791
02:24:45,780 --> 02:24:48,080
Imagine if you had given her the light blue.

4792
02:24:48,340 --> 02:24:50,500
This would probably be $200.

4793
02:24:51,100 --> 02:24:53,240
Yeah, but it would only be on you, Sykuno.

4794
02:24:53,320 --> 02:24:54,840
It doesn't affect Elem in any way.

4795
02:24:55,200 --> 02:24:55,600
True.

4796
02:24:57,340 --> 02:24:59,080
How am I going to pay you back?

4797
02:24:59,280 --> 02:25:00,120
How am I going to pay you back?

4798
02:25:00,280 --> 02:25:02,880
You could technically pay him back right now.

4799
02:25:03,060 --> 02:25:04,740
You could technically pay him back right now.

4800
02:25:04,920 --> 02:25:05,620
But with what money?

4801
02:25:05,960 --> 02:25:09,280
He just spent his money.

4802
02:25:09,440 --> 02:25:11,780
How am I going to pay you back if I only have $100?

4803
02:25:11,840 --> 02:25:13,440
But why are you spending the money you owe me?

4804
02:25:13,440 --> 02:25:15,780
I'll offer the deal one more time, Elem.

4805
02:25:15,900 --> 02:25:16,980
Wait, where does this land me?

4806
02:25:17,160 --> 02:25:18,220
Where does this land me?

4807
02:25:18,600 --> 02:25:19,720
Wait a minute.

4808
02:25:20,720 --> 02:25:21,740
Dude, no.

4809
02:25:22,200 --> 02:25:24,500
That's not even the one.

4810
02:25:25,540 --> 02:25:27,760
Elem, I'll give you this deal one last time.

4811
02:25:28,080 --> 02:25:28,460
It's not the worst.

4812
02:25:28,460 --> 02:25:28,720
Hit me out.

4813
02:25:29,060 --> 02:25:32,260
You give me the yellow.

4814
02:25:32,740 --> 02:25:34,560
I give you the light blue.

4815
02:25:35,180 --> 02:25:36,180
That's too much.

4816
02:25:36,680 --> 02:25:37,600
Dogi, that's too much.

4817
02:25:38,360 --> 02:25:39,780
Every time you land on my...

4818
02:25:39,780 --> 02:25:41,820
I've been giving you everything.

4819
02:25:42,320 --> 02:25:44,240
I give you boardwalk too.

4820
02:25:44,400 --> 02:25:47,340
And then every time you land on my monopolies, I'll pay you back.

4821
02:25:47,560 --> 02:25:49,680
You don't even have to pay on my property.

4822
02:25:49,980 --> 02:25:51,280
How about the rest of the people?

4823
02:25:51,360 --> 02:25:52,820
Think of the common folk, Elem.

4824
02:25:52,940 --> 02:25:55,700
What happens when I land there, man?

4825
02:25:55,780 --> 02:25:56,360
I'm going to die.

4826
02:25:58,320 --> 02:26:00,620
You're getting Zangief grabbed right now.

4827
02:26:00,660 --> 02:26:02,060
She's pushing one button and it's working.

4828
02:26:02,060 --> 02:26:02,520
You know what's crazy?

4829
02:26:02,700 --> 02:26:03,060
You know what's crazy?

4830
02:26:05,100 --> 02:26:07,820
The moment I land on the other blue, he goes, I owe you nothing.

4831
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:09,500
And then I said, give me the $147.

4832
02:26:09,700 --> 02:26:11,920
And then he goes, and then he starts spending the money.

4833
02:26:12,000 --> 02:26:12,940
I don't have $147.

4834
02:26:13,500 --> 02:26:15,400
You started spending the money, you owe me.

4835
02:26:17,180 --> 02:26:21,860
I'll make sure you'll never have to pay any of the property if you land on it.

4836
02:26:21,860 --> 02:26:21,980
I'll make sure you'll never have to pay any of the property if you land on it.

4837
02:26:21,980 --> 02:26:23,300
That's because you'll be out of the game after that.

4838
02:26:23,360 --> 02:26:25,120
You don't have to pay anymore because you'll be donezo.

4839
02:26:25,140 --> 02:26:26,000
I'll give you $50 as well.

4840
02:26:26,820 --> 02:26:29,260
Elem, you're going to be rolled and smoked again.

4841
02:26:29,680 --> 02:26:30,460
What's chat saying?

4842
02:26:30,480 --> 02:26:31,780
If you listen to me, you'll win the game.

4843
02:26:31,780 --> 02:26:33,780
I bet you your chat is saying rolled right now.

4844
02:26:33,940 --> 02:26:37,700
Your chat will say rolled for every decision you make, Elem.

4845
02:26:37,720 --> 02:26:38,600
They're just saying do it.

4846
02:26:40,000 --> 02:26:41,180
Don't do it, Elem.

4847
02:26:41,780 --> 02:26:44,220
They're going to say do it and then say rolled if you accept.

4848
02:26:44,320 --> 02:26:45,180
That's exactly what they're doing.

4849
02:26:45,180 --> 02:26:45,580
I promise you.

4850
02:26:45,600 --> 02:26:49,180
They're going to call the bingle rolled.

4851
02:26:49,500 --> 02:26:50,800
Your chat will say the same thing.

4852
02:26:50,880 --> 02:26:52,340
You want to be known as the bingle rolled?

4853
02:26:52,440 --> 02:26:53,020
Is that it?

4854
02:26:53,160 --> 02:26:55,000
Dude, they're all just going do it and nope.

4855
02:26:55,020 --> 02:26:56,740
This is like a 50-50 split.

4856
02:26:57,020 --> 02:26:58,380
This isn't helping, chat.

4857
02:26:58,780 --> 02:26:59,740
This isn't helping.

4858
02:27:01,780 --> 02:27:03,360
But I would like two monopolies.

4859
02:27:03,740 --> 02:27:05,200
Elem, think about this for one second.

4860
02:27:05,320 --> 02:27:06,500
You get this monopoly and what?

4861
02:27:06,620 --> 02:27:07,480
You buy houses on it?

4862
02:27:07,920 --> 02:27:09,660
Yeah, and then Sykuna will land on it.

4863
02:27:09,880 --> 02:27:11,660
You don't have house money.

4864
02:27:11,680 --> 02:27:13,040
Sykuna already landed on boardwalk.

4865
02:27:13,040 --> 02:27:13,800
Remember that.

4866
02:27:13,960 --> 02:27:15,400
Give her two monopolies.

4867
02:27:15,460 --> 02:27:16,960
And then not be able to buy houses.

4868
02:27:17,260 --> 02:27:18,140
Give me money as well.

4869
02:27:18,340 --> 02:27:20,620
I'll even make sure to be faithful.

4870
02:27:20,780 --> 02:27:22,540
I forgot to put the money in there.

4871
02:27:22,600 --> 02:27:23,360
Do a counter offer.

4872
02:27:23,480 --> 02:27:24,600
I'll put $50 in.

4873
02:27:25,560 --> 02:27:26,280
50 buckaroos?

4874
02:27:26,840 --> 02:27:29,080
Dude, Elem, ask for 100.

4875
02:27:29,080 --> 02:27:32,200
Sykuna slammed you and didn't even put the money in.

4876
02:27:32,720 --> 02:27:33,260
100 bucks.

4877
02:27:33,440 --> 02:27:34,700
150 so you can buy a house.

4878
02:27:34,800 --> 02:27:36,100
150 bucks, come on.

4879
02:27:36,220 --> 02:27:37,220
So you can buy a house.

4880
02:27:37,780 --> 02:27:39,300
And then we gotta do it.

4881
02:27:39,480 --> 02:27:41,440
Property comes with a house, that's a fair deal.

4882
02:27:41,700 --> 02:27:43,120
That's 165.

4883
02:27:44,900 --> 02:27:46,220
Wait, why is it going down so fast?

4884
02:27:46,280 --> 02:27:46,840
I'm not clicking anything.

4885
02:27:47,080 --> 02:27:47,600
Is that me?

4886
02:27:47,800 --> 02:27:48,540
I'm not clicking anything.

4887
02:27:51,660 --> 02:27:52,460
Wait, doki.

4888
02:27:53,300 --> 02:27:54,560
I didn't do anything.

4889
02:27:54,660 --> 02:27:55,900
You ran out of time.

4890
02:27:55,900 --> 02:27:57,880
You ran out of time.

4891
02:27:57,940 --> 02:27:59,900
Okay, 150 bucks.

4892
02:28:00,280 --> 02:28:02,260
The two, plus, and then I get the yellow.

4893
02:28:02,400 --> 02:28:02,960
You gotta do it.

4894
02:28:03,840 --> 02:28:04,560
Okay, sure.

4895
02:28:05,520 --> 02:28:06,220
That's crazy.

4896
02:28:06,520 --> 02:28:08,300
Plus the T's and C's you said though.

4897
02:28:08,680 --> 02:28:10,680
If I land on you, you'll give me the money back.

4898
02:28:11,340 --> 02:28:11,740
Yeah.

4899
02:28:12,200 --> 02:28:13,240
Why did you say it like that?

4900
02:28:14,940 --> 02:28:15,340
That's just how I talk.

4901
02:28:15,340 --> 02:28:21,180
Elem, if she lands on a property after she gives you 150 bucks, she can't even give you the money to pay her back.

4902
02:28:22,300 --> 02:28:24,300
How about I'll give you $100?

4903
02:28:25,320 --> 02:28:25,720
$100?

4904
02:28:25,900 --> 02:28:26,340
$125.

4905
02:28:28,000 --> 02:28:28,480
$125.

4906
02:28:29,280 --> 02:28:29,760
$105.

4907
02:28:32,720 --> 02:28:33,200
$105.

4908
02:28:33,660 --> 02:28:34,140
$106.

4909
02:28:34,500 --> 02:28:34,980
$110.

4910
02:28:37,000 --> 02:28:37,480
$110?

4911
02:28:38,620 --> 02:28:39,100
$107.

4912
02:28:39,720 --> 02:28:40,200
$109.

4913
02:28:40,980 --> 02:28:42,080
What's your offer?

4914
02:28:42,280 --> 02:28:45,460
I pressed it wrong.

4915
02:28:45,540 --> 02:28:49,760
In which case, because of that mistake, I'm charging you a premium of $125.

4916
02:28:50,960 --> 02:28:51,440
Oh.

4917
02:28:52,300 --> 02:28:53,580
Yeah, that sounds fair.

4918
02:28:53,740 --> 02:28:54,220
$125.

4919
02:28:54,360 --> 02:28:54,540
$125.

4920
02:28:54,720 --> 02:28:55,040
Come on now.

4921
02:28:56,100 --> 02:28:58,060
Dude, this is such a great deal.

4922
02:28:58,160 --> 02:28:58,280
Right?

4923
02:28:58,400 --> 02:28:58,740
Deal.

4924
02:28:59,340 --> 02:29:01,160
Trading is the heart of business.

4925
02:29:01,480 --> 02:29:02,380
It's a good deal for somebody.

4926
02:29:03,020 --> 02:29:04,660
How about $120?

4927
02:29:06,000 --> 02:29:06,620
Okay, $120.

4928
02:29:08,160 --> 02:29:09,240
What's your offer?

4929
02:29:09,640 --> 02:29:10,860
Wait, I don't know the way she said that.

4930
02:29:11,120 --> 02:29:11,520
Oh, wow.

4931
02:29:13,880 --> 02:29:15,160
Flavin, you said okay.

4932
02:29:15,420 --> 02:29:17,000
So, I mean, you just got it.

4933
02:29:17,200 --> 02:29:19,440
My value is higher than yours.

4934
02:29:19,560 --> 02:29:21,980
There's one person I know who wouldn't lie to me and that's Hyun.

4935
02:29:22,020 --> 02:29:23,740
Hyun, I would like to go to my financial advisor.

4936
02:29:24,240 --> 02:29:25,000
Is this a good deal?

4937
02:29:25,040 --> 02:29:25,240
Huh?

4938
02:29:25,900 --> 02:29:27,300
You're now officially my financial advisor.

4939
02:29:27,480 --> 02:29:28,280
What do you mean?

4940
02:29:29,520 --> 02:29:31,620
Hyun wouldn't betray me.

4941
02:29:31,680 --> 02:29:32,560
She wouldn't betray me.

4942
02:29:33,100 --> 02:29:35,020
That's because she's never on your side.

4943
02:29:35,240 --> 02:29:36,300
She can't betray you.

4944
02:29:37,320 --> 02:29:40,200
Well, what do you want more?

4945
02:29:40,320 --> 02:29:41,460
Like, I mean, you're...

4946
02:29:41,460 --> 02:29:43,380
Do you want Sykkuno to lose more?

4947
02:29:43,580 --> 02:29:44,900
Or do you want to lose?

4948
02:29:45,680 --> 02:29:46,340
There you go.

4949
02:29:47,020 --> 02:29:48,520
We can both win, Elem.

4950
02:29:48,700 --> 02:29:51,100
And now we're going to be fine because now I have money, brother.

4951
02:29:51,180 --> 02:29:52,680
I can do this far.

4952
02:29:53,420 --> 02:29:54,940
Sykkuno, you're such a dick.

4953
02:29:55,040 --> 02:29:55,800
Sykkuno, I...

4954
02:29:57,520 --> 02:29:58,860
You're such a dick.

4955
02:29:58,860 --> 02:29:59,900
You're such a dick.

4956
02:29:59,900 --> 02:30:00,260
You're such a dick.

4957
02:30:00,260 --> 02:30:00,600
You're such a dick.

4958
02:30:02,900 --> 02:30:06,940
You're the one who's spamming it in my chat, you asshole.

4959
02:30:07,160 --> 02:30:09,020
Dude, your chat is spamming it right now, dude.

4960
02:30:09,040 --> 02:30:10,380
This is crazy that you've done this.

4961
02:30:10,620 --> 02:30:13,600
It's crazy that you've incited the masses.

4962
02:30:13,600 --> 02:30:14,820
They're spamming rolled again.

4963
02:30:15,140 --> 02:30:16,660
No, because now Doggy can't even buy houses.

4964
02:30:16,760 --> 02:30:17,460
Look, dude, look, look.

4965
02:30:17,460 --> 02:30:18,360
She's so broke.

4966
02:30:18,480 --> 02:30:19,280
Land on Orange.

4967
02:30:19,280 --> 02:30:21,340
If she lands on Orange, there's a justice in this world.

4968
02:30:21,780 --> 02:30:22,220
No!

4969
02:30:22,900 --> 02:30:25,120
Dude, she skipped all the Oranges.

4970
02:30:25,280 --> 02:30:25,880
No shot.

4971
02:30:26,500 --> 02:30:27,500
It's over, Elem.

4972
02:30:27,540 --> 02:30:27,920
It's over.

4973
02:30:28,080 --> 02:30:28,440
Oh, hey, it's my property.

4974
02:30:29,340 --> 02:30:29,780
No!

4975
02:30:31,240 --> 02:30:32,380
Yeah, she has a monopoly.

4976
02:30:32,580 --> 02:30:33,820
She's got three monopolies, Elem.

4977
02:30:34,020 --> 02:30:34,800
Because of you!

4978
02:30:35,040 --> 02:30:38,420
What are you saying because of me?

4979
02:30:38,480 --> 02:30:39,300
Are you insane?

4980
02:30:39,540 --> 02:30:41,840
You're lying to me.

4981
02:30:42,200 --> 02:30:44,980
You just gave her two monopolies.

4982
02:30:45,000 --> 02:30:46,120
I don't even know what you're even talking about.

4983
02:30:46,240 --> 02:30:48,200
You can't just pay because of me.

4984
02:30:50,700 --> 02:30:52,320
I don't even know what to believe anymore.

4985
02:30:52,500 --> 02:30:52,700
I don't even know what to believe anymore, okay?

4986
02:30:52,800 --> 02:30:53,980
I don't even know what to believe anymore.

4987
02:30:54,400 --> 02:30:55,440
All men do is lie.

4988
02:30:56,880 --> 02:30:57,800
Someone's spam rolled.

4989
02:30:57,880 --> 02:31:00,160
If I land on a property right now, I'm going to go scorch it.

4990
02:31:00,280 --> 02:31:00,900
I'm going to break something.

4991
02:31:01,820 --> 02:31:02,580
Oh, thank Christ.

4992
02:31:05,020 --> 02:31:06,100
That's finally paying out.

4993
02:31:06,440 --> 02:31:08,580
Thank you.

4994
02:31:08,840 --> 02:31:09,480
Thank you.

4995
02:31:11,420 --> 02:31:12,440
Give me the money back.

4996
02:31:12,520 --> 02:31:12,900
Come on, please.

4997
02:31:13,880 --> 02:31:14,600
Money back?

4998
02:31:15,800 --> 02:31:18,600
You're my financial advisor.

4999
02:31:19,280 --> 02:31:19,660
You're my money.

5000
02:31:19,780 --> 02:31:22,020
The financial advisor.

5001
02:31:22,020 --> 02:31:22,700
What do you mean?

5002
02:31:22,820 --> 02:31:24,600
I'm in jail.

5003
02:31:24,940 --> 02:31:26,260
I have no money.

5004
02:31:26,380 --> 02:31:27,100
I hope you say that.

5005
02:31:27,560 --> 02:31:28,540
Brought in prison.

5006
02:31:28,660 --> 02:31:31,040
Brought in prison.

5007
02:31:31,400 --> 02:31:32,160
Brought in prison.

5008
02:31:33,880 --> 02:31:36,540
Brought in prison.

5009
02:31:38,640 --> 02:31:39,480
Oh, man.

5010
02:31:39,700 --> 02:31:41,420
Does she have to buy out yet?

5011
02:31:41,460 --> 02:31:43,480
No, she can do it for two more.

5012
02:31:43,540 --> 02:31:44,440
Two more turns.

5013
02:31:44,440 --> 02:31:45,140
Oh.

5014
02:31:45,860 --> 02:31:46,640
No way.

5015
02:31:46,900 --> 02:31:47,840
We love that.

5016
02:31:47,920 --> 02:31:49,540
I like being in my little safe space.

5017
02:31:49,940 --> 02:31:52,040
Yeah, just earning money without having to go.

5018
02:31:52,040 --> 02:31:53,820
Did she just buy more houses?

5019
02:31:55,420 --> 02:31:58,680
Bro, we're so freaking broke right now.

5020
02:32:00,140 --> 02:32:01,380
This is bad, guys.

5021
02:32:01,440 --> 02:32:02,080
This is...

5022
02:32:02,080 --> 02:32:03,980
I'm not getting rolled.

5023
02:32:04,040 --> 02:32:05,140
It's going to be fine.

5024
02:32:05,720 --> 02:32:07,400
I'm not getting...

5025
02:32:07,400 --> 02:32:10,360
He's getting death rolled by a crocodilius right now.

5026
02:32:10,360 --> 02:32:10,380
I'm not.

5027
02:32:10,380 --> 02:32:11,440
I'm going to be fined.

5028
02:32:13,160 --> 02:32:14,200
A crocodilius?

5029
02:32:14,440 --> 02:32:14,880
Got him.

5030
02:32:16,160 --> 02:32:16,560
No.

5031
02:32:17,060 --> 02:32:17,900
Look at this, Ellen.

5032
02:32:18,020 --> 02:32:18,880
This is because of you.

5033
02:32:19,420 --> 02:32:21,520
This blood is on your hands, Ellen.

5034
02:32:21,520 --> 02:32:21,980
What do you mean?

5035
02:32:22,060 --> 02:32:23,400
It's literally on you.

5036
02:32:23,400 --> 02:32:24,380
I don't even know.

5037
02:32:24,500 --> 02:32:25,040
You know what?

5038
02:32:26,000 --> 02:32:27,280
You gave her the pinks.

5039
02:32:27,460 --> 02:32:29,800
I've been blaming you this entire game.

5040
02:32:30,160 --> 02:32:31,660
You really gave her the pinks.

5041
02:32:31,760 --> 02:32:34,560
Dude, you owe me 147 bucks still.

5042
02:32:34,800 --> 02:32:35,820
Give me the money.

5043
02:32:36,520 --> 02:32:37,680
Enjoy your one dollar.

5044
02:32:37,780 --> 02:32:38,840
I'm collecting my money right now.

5045
02:32:38,940 --> 02:32:40,340
Enjoy your one dollar.

5046
02:32:40,440 --> 02:32:43,060
You can give me your orange as well.

5047
02:32:45,260 --> 02:32:46,300
Thank you so much.

5048
02:32:46,300 --> 02:32:47,160
Thank you so much.

5049
02:32:47,180 --> 02:32:47,560
I appreciate it.

5050
02:32:47,760 --> 02:32:48,760
I need someone to land on it so I actually have money.

5051
02:32:49,880 --> 02:32:50,880
Wait, 48 bucks.

5052
02:32:51,020 --> 02:32:52,380
48 buckaroos, man.

5053
02:32:52,500 --> 02:32:52,880
Yeah, yellow.

5054
02:32:55,360 --> 02:32:56,700
Remember what I did?

5055
02:32:56,800 --> 02:32:57,960
I gave you that yellow.

5056
02:32:58,340 --> 02:32:59,400
Please just be fine.

5057
02:33:00,020 --> 02:33:02,160
That's almost 50 bucks with no...

5058
02:33:03,120 --> 02:33:03,560
Yes.

5059
02:33:04,660 --> 02:33:07,000
And then with this, I buy more.

5060
02:33:07,300 --> 02:33:09,020
I buy another house.

5061
02:33:10,260 --> 02:33:11,480
Another house, guys.

5062
02:33:11,480 --> 02:33:12,680
That's a game ender, bro.

5063
02:33:12,980 --> 02:33:14,540
That is a game ender.

5064
02:33:14,560 --> 02:33:17,260
If I land on that, that's a bomba.

5065
02:33:17,680 --> 02:33:19,420
Yeah, I love being in here.

5066
02:33:19,640 --> 02:33:20,840
I love being out here.

5067
02:33:21,180 --> 02:33:21,660
Nice.

5068
02:33:21,840 --> 02:33:23,380
Just chilling in jail.

5069
02:33:24,340 --> 02:33:26,080
Wait, she's out.

5070
02:33:26,820 --> 02:33:28,240
She misses all the oranges.

5071
02:33:28,240 --> 02:33:31,300
You can always decide what's going to happen to you.

5072
02:33:31,300 --> 02:33:32,180
Advance to New York.

5073
02:33:32,520 --> 02:33:34,180
Yeah, you get to go to jail!

5074
02:33:35,120 --> 02:33:36,560
That makes sense.

5075
02:33:37,980 --> 02:33:40,320
Dude, Yoon is having the best luck ever.

5076
02:33:40,400 --> 02:33:40,880
This is insane.

5077
02:33:41,480 --> 02:33:42,620
No way, dude.

5078
02:33:43,040 --> 02:33:43,960
This is a good day.

5079
02:33:45,000 --> 02:33:47,780
Bro, she's just in jail building properties.

5080
02:33:47,840 --> 02:33:49,420
What in the name of fraud is this?

5081
02:33:49,660 --> 02:33:50,720
Is this BS, dude?

5082
02:33:51,040 --> 02:33:52,160
She can't be doing this.

5083
02:33:52,180 --> 02:33:52,800
This is insane.

5084
02:33:53,040 --> 02:33:54,620
Now's a good time to think about your next move.

5085
02:33:55,060 --> 02:33:59,920
Please, for the love of god, I swear, I want her to land on my property so fucking bad, you have no idea.

5086
02:34:00,320 --> 02:34:01,160
I need to go to prison.

5087
02:34:01,320 --> 02:34:02,720
Please land on my property.

5088
02:34:03,060 --> 02:34:03,900
Wait a minute.

5089
02:34:04,180 --> 02:34:05,220
Wait a minute.

5090
02:34:05,420 --> 02:34:08,440
Wait a minute.

5091
02:34:08,580 --> 02:34:08,740
Yes!

5092
02:34:10,240 --> 02:34:10,600
Yes!

5093
02:34:11,480 --> 02:34:11,780
Yes!

5094
02:34:12,040 --> 02:34:12,440
Yes!

5095
02:34:12,620 --> 02:34:12,960
Yes!

5096
02:34:15,280 --> 02:34:18,120
Oh my god, yes!

5097
02:34:18,520 --> 02:34:19,060
Wait, what are you doing?

5098
02:34:19,160 --> 02:34:19,700
What are you doing?

5099
02:34:19,900 --> 02:34:20,400
What are you doing?

5100
02:34:20,500 --> 02:34:21,020
What are you doing?

5101
02:34:21,780 --> 02:34:22,940
No, no, no.

5102
02:34:23,000 --> 02:34:23,220
Doki?

5103
02:34:23,900 --> 02:34:24,300
Doki?

5104
02:34:25,340 --> 02:34:26,280
Doki, what are you...

5105
02:34:26,280 --> 02:34:27,640
Dude, you don't have enough money.

5106
02:34:27,700 --> 02:34:28,860
She's gonna have mortgage stuff.

5107
02:34:29,160 --> 02:34:29,560
Doki?

5108
02:34:29,740 --> 02:34:30,140
That's fine.

5109
02:34:30,620 --> 02:34:34,020
Can I give an IOU of 136 since you're in jail?

5110
02:34:34,220 --> 02:34:36,940
The game has completely turned around with one bad roll.

5111
02:34:37,060 --> 02:34:37,580
That's crazy.

5112
02:34:38,900 --> 02:34:39,300
Doki?

5113
02:34:39,460 --> 02:34:39,880
Oh my god.

5114
02:34:42,440 --> 02:34:42,760
Doki?

5115
02:34:44,240 --> 02:34:45,860
Wait, what's the strat here?

5116
02:34:46,080 --> 02:34:46,540
What's the...

5117
02:34:46,540 --> 02:34:47,540
What are you trying to...

5118
02:34:48,820 --> 02:34:49,960
What are you trying to do right now?

5119
02:34:50,380 --> 02:34:52,740
You could mortgage the properties and still pay it off.

5120
02:34:52,760 --> 02:34:53,360
It would be fine.

5121
02:34:54,540 --> 02:34:54,960
Wait, what is this?

5122
02:34:54,960 --> 02:34:56,300
Yeah, but then I can mortgage less.

5123
02:34:56,560 --> 02:34:57,380
It's an IOU.

5124
02:34:57,520 --> 02:35:00,120
You're trying to take the money from Hyun on an IOU?

5125
02:35:00,120 --> 02:35:01,900
Dude, Ellen, why can't our team make...

5126
02:35:01,900 --> 02:35:03,920
Dude, Ellen, why isn't our team like this, man?

5127
02:35:03,920 --> 02:35:05,460
Dude, no, okay, from this point on, from this point on...

5128
02:35:05,460 --> 02:35:06,360
Dude, look at them covering each other.

5129
02:35:06,440 --> 02:35:06,880
Dude, this is us.

5130
02:35:06,880 --> 02:35:09,380
You can't even spot me 147 bucks in my house.

5131
02:35:09,380 --> 02:35:10,480
I'm homeless on the streets.

5132
02:35:10,520 --> 02:35:11,220
No, I got you, bro.

5133
02:35:11,640 --> 02:35:12,340
Come on in.

5134
02:35:12,420 --> 02:35:13,780
The water's warm, brother.

5135
02:35:13,840 --> 02:35:14,660
I've run you a bath.

5136
02:35:14,780 --> 02:35:15,900
I've got some food ready, okay?

5137
02:35:17,240 --> 02:35:18,480
She's gonna have to mortgage, though.

5138
02:35:18,560 --> 02:35:20,360
Time to mortgage, Doki.

5139
02:35:20,520 --> 02:35:21,200
Time to mortgage.

5140
02:35:22,460 --> 02:35:23,780
I'm gonna have to mortgage a lot.

5141
02:35:24,040 --> 02:35:25,940
I'll tell you what, I'll buy...

5142
02:35:25,940 --> 02:35:27,220
Dude, I have no money either.

5143
02:35:28,360 --> 02:35:29,680
I can't even make a deal.

5144
02:35:29,700 --> 02:35:30,060
I'm broke.

5145
02:35:31,740 --> 02:35:32,720
I can't even...

5146
02:35:32,720 --> 02:35:34,280
I have 100 bucks.

5147
02:35:34,280 --> 02:35:36,780
Bro humbled himself so quickly then, that was Chris.

5148
02:35:37,180 --> 02:35:40,780
I mean, I'd like to try and make a deal, but there's just no deal I can make at this point.

5149
02:35:40,880 --> 02:35:42,980
With 148 bucks, it's not...

5150
02:35:42,980 --> 02:35:44,140
Dude, Ellum might win this one.

5151
02:35:44,140 --> 02:35:46,720
Well, I mean, he's just about to get, like, $500.

5152
02:35:47,340 --> 02:35:48,740
Yeah, he's just about to get $500.

5153
02:35:50,260 --> 02:35:51,140
500 buckaroos, bro!

5154
02:35:53,740 --> 02:35:54,420
500 buckaroos!

5155
02:35:54,500 --> 02:35:56,560
Oh my god, Ellum's about to win the whole damn game.

5156
02:35:56,760 --> 02:35:57,580
Yes, dude!

5157
02:35:57,780 --> 02:36:01,080
You know, I'm okay with Ellum winning, as long as Sykkuno doesn't win.

5158
02:36:01,080 --> 02:36:03,060
But a win for me is a win for Sykkuno, you know?

5159
02:36:03,060 --> 02:36:03,840
Exactly, out of curiosity.

5160
02:36:05,140 --> 02:36:06,760
I feel like I've done nothing.

5161
02:36:06,900 --> 02:36:08,260
I've done nothing but look up to you.

5162
02:36:08,260 --> 02:36:10,220
I've seen how you do your deals.

5163
02:36:10,220 --> 02:36:11,600
I've done nothing but look up to you as a fellow Zangiefa.

5164
02:36:11,600 --> 02:36:15,160
And if you've done all of that just to lose, that's my victory.

5165
02:36:15,560 --> 02:36:17,360
Dude, I only have one property.

5166
02:36:17,760 --> 02:36:19,140
I only got an orange.

5167
02:36:19,480 --> 02:36:20,620
That's barely anything.

5168
02:36:20,980 --> 02:36:22,660
Dude, Ellum's gonna win though, not gonna lie.

5169
02:36:22,840 --> 02:36:24,880
That landing spot is epic.

5170
02:36:25,760 --> 02:36:27,840
Dude, this game hates you.

5171
02:36:28,240 --> 02:36:28,940
That's absurd.

5172
02:36:29,660 --> 02:36:32,560
This game just doesn't want you to win.

5173
02:36:34,940 --> 02:36:35,300
That's fine.

5174
02:36:35,480 --> 02:36:37,780
If I know who's gonna lose, that's fine.

5175
02:36:37,920 --> 02:36:38,920
If I know who's gonna lose, that's fine.

5176
02:36:38,920 --> 02:36:43,380
The fact that you try to scam Ellum so many times.

5177
02:36:43,420 --> 02:36:43,520
The fact that you try to scam Ellum so many times.

5178
02:36:43,520 --> 02:36:45,800
And if he wins that game...

5179
02:36:45,800 --> 02:36:47,620
Whoa, whoa, I didn't scam him.

5180
02:36:48,000 --> 02:36:48,140
Whoa, whoa, I didn't scam him.

5181
02:36:48,200 --> 02:36:50,920
Let me get one of them there real quick.

5182
02:36:51,000 --> 02:36:51,980
Let me get one of them there real quick.

5183
02:36:52,320 --> 02:36:53,040
I could.

5184
02:36:53,220 --> 02:36:54,900
I could do a third one.

5185
02:36:54,900 --> 02:36:56,580
Dude, if anybody, Ellum's actually gonna win.

5186
02:36:56,700 --> 02:36:58,760
If anybody lands on these landmines...

5187
02:36:58,760 --> 02:36:59,660
You know what?

5188
02:37:00,060 --> 02:37:01,260
We're gonna leave it at that right now.

5189
02:37:01,320 --> 02:37:02,140
We're gonna leave it at that right now.

5190
02:37:03,060 --> 02:37:04,100
It's so GG.

5191
02:37:04,220 --> 02:37:06,640
Ellum got this in the bagging tin, as they say.

5192
02:37:06,960 --> 02:37:07,140
It's so GG.

5193
02:37:07,140 --> 02:37:07,140
Ellum got this in the bagging tin, as they say.

5194
02:37:07,140 --> 02:37:07,580
Oh yeah.

5195
02:37:08,120 --> 02:37:10,760
Dude, we need Huynh to roll like an 8.

5196
02:37:10,760 --> 02:37:12,540
What is going on with my 8?

5197
02:37:13,300 --> 02:37:14,400
This is good.

5198
02:37:14,540 --> 02:37:15,200
This is very, very good.

5199
02:37:15,200 --> 02:37:16,640
Oh, she did roll an 8, but not a double.

5200
02:37:16,820 --> 02:37:17,900
Ow, ow, ow, ow.

5201
02:37:18,220 --> 02:37:21,640
Dude, that 8 would have been massive for me.

5202
02:37:21,700 --> 02:37:22,700
It just would have been massive.

5203
02:37:23,600 --> 02:37:27,200
Dude, if I land on that blue, I don't think I can even come back.

5204
02:37:27,740 --> 02:37:28,540
I don't think I can even come back.

5205
02:37:28,540 --> 02:37:28,760
Yes!

5206
02:37:29,380 --> 02:37:29,780
Huge!

5207
02:37:29,780 --> 02:37:31,120
Oh my god.

5208
02:37:32,080 --> 02:37:34,160
He went to jail.

5209
02:37:34,400 --> 02:37:34,800
Let's go!

5210
02:37:35,420 --> 02:37:36,700
Jail time, brothers.

5211
02:37:36,960 --> 02:37:39,000
There's no shot, dude.

5212
02:37:39,860 --> 02:37:43,520
He's gonna go in jail, and then he's gonna get out of jail next turn.

5213
02:37:43,540 --> 02:37:43,920
Oops.

5214
02:37:44,940 --> 02:37:45,920
No, no, that's right.

5215
02:37:45,960 --> 02:37:47,880
You owe me 147 bucks.

5216
02:37:47,980 --> 02:37:49,260
Give me my money.

5217
02:37:49,400 --> 02:37:51,740
Stop spending my money.

5218
02:37:52,000 --> 02:37:54,360
He's not gonna give you your money back.

5219
02:37:54,480 --> 02:37:55,320
He's not gonna give you that money.

5220
02:37:55,780 --> 02:38:01,600
As soon as I take the money back, Dude, what if I land on it?

5221
02:38:01,660 --> 02:38:03,200
What if I land on it, bro?

5222
02:38:03,960 --> 02:38:05,260
I'll send the money back to you.

5223
02:38:06,360 --> 02:38:08,420
I'll have to mortgage my properties, bro.

5224
02:38:08,680 --> 02:38:09,940
What do you mean?

5225
02:38:10,040 --> 02:38:11,660
It's only 300 on the orange.

5226
02:38:11,780 --> 02:38:12,220
It's only 300.

5227
02:38:12,500 --> 02:38:13,680
And I'll send it right back.

5228
02:38:13,880 --> 02:38:14,440
We got a deal.

5229
02:38:14,620 --> 02:38:15,260
Are you sure?

5230
02:38:15,340 --> 02:38:15,960
Will you actually?

5231
02:38:17,000 --> 02:38:17,800
Yeah, 100%.

5232
02:38:17,800 --> 02:38:18,820
Land on it and find out.

5233
02:38:18,900 --> 02:38:19,860
Okay, okay.

5234
02:38:21,060 --> 02:38:22,220
Land on it twice and find out.

5235
02:38:22,220 --> 02:38:23,160
I'll land on it right now.

5236
02:38:23,440 --> 02:38:25,000
Now you said twice.

5237
02:38:27,860 --> 02:38:29,080
Just to double proof it.

5238
02:38:29,080 --> 02:38:30,720
Oh, that's for you.

5239
02:38:31,120 --> 02:38:31,420
Thank you.

5240
02:38:32,240 --> 02:38:34,400
Stop taking my money from me.

5241
02:38:34,440 --> 02:38:35,560
Why do you keep doing this?

5242
02:38:36,460 --> 02:38:37,740
Oh my goodness.

5243
02:38:38,180 --> 02:38:39,580
Well, you know, I'm just a little...

5244
02:38:39,580 --> 02:38:42,040
You should stop landing on your property.

5245
02:38:42,040 --> 02:38:43,520
You might have to mortgage something after this.

5246
02:38:43,540 --> 02:38:44,040
No!

5247
02:38:45,420 --> 02:38:46,100
60 bucks.

5248
02:38:46,760 --> 02:38:48,160
Oh my god.

5249
02:38:48,260 --> 02:38:49,080
Oh my god.

5250
02:38:49,100 --> 02:38:49,980
Finally, it's paid out.

5251
02:38:50,100 --> 02:38:50,580
Finally.

5252
02:38:50,660 --> 02:38:52,080
The years of waiting.

5253
02:38:52,760 --> 02:38:55,820
Finally, St. James is popping, boys.

5254
02:38:56,600 --> 02:38:57,160
$550.

5255
02:38:58,920 --> 02:38:59,800
Yeehaw, cowboy.

5256
02:39:00,340 --> 02:39:01,720
That's the money I needed.

5257
02:39:02,480 --> 02:39:03,400
Oh my gosh.

5258
02:39:04,120 --> 02:39:05,300
I'll give you a deal.

5259
02:39:05,320 --> 02:39:06,520
I don't know how she crawls out.

5260
02:39:06,520 --> 02:39:07,800
I'll give you all the money I have.

5261
02:39:07,840 --> 02:39:09,100
Even if she mortgages everything.

5262
02:39:09,280 --> 02:39:13,240
I'll give you my property, the mortgage.

5263
02:39:14,240 --> 02:39:15,060
Oh my god.

5264
02:39:15,220 --> 02:39:17,340
Can I have my 140 bucks now?

5265
02:39:18,100 --> 02:39:18,920
I'll tell you what.

5266
02:39:18,960 --> 02:39:20,580
I'll give you the double just as promised.

5267
02:39:21,060 --> 02:39:22,360
Oh my god, he did what he did.

5268
02:39:22,520 --> 02:39:23,280
Yes, the guarantee.

5269
02:39:23,680 --> 02:39:24,500
The guarantee.

5270
02:39:24,500 --> 02:39:25,420
You forgot.

5271
02:39:25,500 --> 02:39:26,800
You forgot about the double deal.

5272
02:39:26,800 --> 02:39:27,500
And he reminded me of it.

5273
02:39:28,180 --> 02:39:33,940
Because if there's one thing I ask people to do, it's to judge me on how many times I scam you because it's so few times.

5274
02:39:34,100 --> 02:39:35,040
Yeah, I'll give you my property.

5275
02:39:35,520 --> 02:39:38,800
Isn't that a quote from Wolf of Wall Street?

5276
02:39:39,020 --> 02:39:39,720
Yeah, it is.

5277
02:39:39,720 --> 02:39:40,040
It is.

5278
02:39:40,300 --> 02:39:42,060
The ones that aren't mortgaged yet.

5279
02:39:42,200 --> 02:39:43,720
Because there's so few of them.

5280
02:39:43,740 --> 02:39:44,820
Because there's so few of them.

5281
02:39:45,580 --> 02:39:47,800
Judge me on my losses because there's so few of them.

5282
02:39:47,980 --> 02:39:48,380
Yup.

5283
02:39:48,400 --> 02:39:48,680
Yup.

5284
02:39:48,820 --> 02:39:50,180
And we got some big wins.

5285
02:39:50,280 --> 02:39:52,360
Listen, Ellen, you just won a $500 landing.

5286
02:39:52,360 --> 02:39:54,200
I just got a $500 landing.

5287
02:39:54,320 --> 02:39:55,340
We got the teamwork.

5288
02:39:55,400 --> 02:39:56,320
We're the A team right now.

5289
02:39:56,480 --> 02:39:57,340
We both win.

5290
02:39:57,680 --> 02:39:58,780
We both win this.

5291
02:39:59,500 --> 02:40:00,600
You ever see the boys?

5292
02:40:01,160 --> 02:40:05,480
You're like Homelander right now and I'm like I don't know, man.

5293
02:40:05,640 --> 02:40:06,820
I'm like Who would I be?

5294
02:40:06,840 --> 02:40:08,460
I actually haven't watched the boys.

5295
02:40:08,540 --> 02:40:08,960
I'm not even gonna lie.

5296
02:40:09,640 --> 02:40:10,400
No, no, no.

5297
02:40:12,400 --> 02:40:13,600
How much do you need?

5298
02:40:15,540 --> 02:40:16,920
She needs $550.

5299
02:40:17,100 --> 02:40:17,940
I think $550.

5300
02:40:18,200 --> 02:40:21,500
Dude, look at this perfect synchronization between these right now.

5301
02:40:21,560 --> 02:40:21,940
It's crazy.

5302
02:40:22,360 --> 02:40:28,360
I'm trying to figure out what is the most like I am so good at my chances going police so I'm just like you know.

5303
02:40:28,600 --> 02:40:29,920
Dude, he's not you.

5304
02:40:29,920 --> 02:40:31,440
This is what we call a team.

5305
02:40:31,520 --> 02:40:32,500
An alliance.

5306
02:40:32,980 --> 02:40:33,400
We're winning.

5307
02:40:33,540 --> 02:40:33,920
Okay?

5308
02:40:33,960 --> 02:40:35,300
We're up right now, guys.

5309
02:40:35,420 --> 02:40:35,820
We're up.

5310
02:40:36,080 --> 02:40:37,520
We are up.

5311
02:40:37,540 --> 02:40:37,920
On top.

5312
02:40:37,980 --> 02:40:38,620
This is it.

5313
02:40:39,100 --> 02:40:40,400
Should I just do this?

5314
02:40:40,520 --> 02:40:41,740
I don't know what's the best here.

5315
02:40:41,740 --> 02:40:42,260
I buy more houses.

5316
02:40:43,340 --> 02:40:43,780
Okay.

5317
02:40:47,020 --> 02:40:48,360
That could just...

5318
02:40:48,900 --> 02:40:49,540
What does that mean?

5319
02:40:50,500 --> 02:40:51,300
Is that enough?

5320
02:40:52,360 --> 02:40:52,540
Wait, no.

5321
02:40:52,640 --> 02:40:53,180
Don't say that.

5322
02:40:53,480 --> 02:40:54,840
I need $10.

5323
02:40:55,240 --> 02:40:57,440
I need $9.

5324
02:40:57,440 --> 02:40:58,400
He sleeps with an octopus.

5325
02:40:59,340 --> 02:41:00,800
He sleeps with a what?

5326
02:41:01,040 --> 02:41:01,720
With an octopus.

5327
02:41:04,620 --> 02:41:05,820
He's a guy who...

5328
02:41:05,820 --> 02:41:06,440
I didn't know that.

5329
02:41:08,420 --> 02:41:09,960
Is that even possible?

5330
02:41:10,620 --> 02:41:13,720
He's an aquatic hero, basically.

5331
02:41:14,500 --> 02:41:15,900
Yeah, that's kind of weird.

5332
02:41:16,680 --> 02:41:18,040
He's like the deepest.

5333
02:41:18,140 --> 02:41:18,760
It's crazy.

5334
02:41:19,560 --> 02:41:22,640
Then how do I collect this whole thing?

5335
02:41:23,320 --> 02:41:24,120
Oh, we're winning.

5336
02:41:24,260 --> 02:41:25,020
We're winning, dude.

5337
02:41:26,000 --> 02:41:32,800
Well, the thing about winning is that only one person can win, so which one out of you two are going to be the real winner?

5338
02:41:33,460 --> 02:41:35,560
And a win for Sykuno is a win for me.

5339
02:41:35,600 --> 02:41:36,500
That's what they always say.

5340
02:41:36,540 --> 02:41:37,820
The team work's kicking in.

5341
02:41:37,940 --> 02:41:38,840
The boys.

5342
02:41:40,220 --> 02:41:42,360
They doubted our strength.

5343
02:41:42,400 --> 02:41:43,160
They did.

5344
02:41:43,680 --> 02:41:44,980
They literally did.

5345
02:41:45,120 --> 02:41:45,920
And now look at us.

5346
02:41:45,920 --> 02:41:47,780
But I'll tell you what...

5347
02:41:47,780 --> 02:41:54,640
Hey, Elem, if I trade the rest of my property to you, will you break the alliance with Sykuno?

5348
02:41:55,460 --> 02:41:57,300
And I'll just declare bankruptcy?

5349
02:41:58,280 --> 02:41:58,760
What?

5350
02:41:59,180 --> 02:42:01,160
You think I would do that?

5351
02:42:01,200 --> 02:42:02,140
We could both win.

5352
02:42:02,300 --> 02:42:04,160
They're desperate, Elem.

5353
02:42:04,900 --> 02:42:07,520
There could only be one winner, Elem.

5354
02:42:07,620 --> 02:42:09,060
But does there need to be one winner?

5355
02:42:09,480 --> 02:42:10,660
We both win.

5356
02:42:11,120 --> 02:42:19,020
The only way for this game to end is if all the players except for one lose this game, is if we break up our teamwork.

5357
02:42:19,040 --> 02:42:21,780
Syk, my chat is saying, do it, do it, do it.

5358
02:42:22,100 --> 02:42:26,440
The only way we even have a chance of losing is by breaking up the team right now.

5359
02:42:26,440 --> 02:42:27,160
We're dominant.

5360
02:42:28,460 --> 02:42:29,580
We're A-side right now.

5361
02:42:29,980 --> 02:42:30,660
Do you know what I mean?

5362
02:42:30,800 --> 02:42:32,860
At this point, why fold?

5363
02:42:33,020 --> 02:42:34,300
Why even think about it, man?

5364
02:42:34,360 --> 02:42:34,920
We can't lose.

5365
02:42:35,780 --> 02:42:37,720
Syk, so you give me the hundred...

5366
02:42:37,720 --> 02:42:38,880
Wait, where did my money go?

5367
02:42:39,440 --> 02:42:40,880
Syk, you're gonna give me the money.

5368
02:42:41,720 --> 02:42:42,440
What do you mean?

5369
02:42:42,560 --> 02:42:43,640
I haven't got paid yet.

5370
02:42:43,780 --> 02:42:44,800
They're still mortgaging.

5371
02:42:45,920 --> 02:42:47,180
Oh, I see.

5372
02:42:48,220 --> 02:42:48,680
I see.

5373
02:42:50,440 --> 02:42:56,320
You give me that money, and you don't suddenly just start building properties, then we'll keep the alliance.

5374
02:42:57,140 --> 02:42:58,480
Here's a crazy idea.

5375
02:42:58,960 --> 02:43:01,200
I double it again.

5376
02:43:01,420 --> 02:43:03,280
Shut the fuck up.

5377
02:43:03,760 --> 02:43:05,140
You don't want $600?

5378
02:43:05,720 --> 02:43:06,900
$300 is enough for you.

5379
02:43:07,760 --> 02:43:08,760
That's all you want?

5380
02:43:08,860 --> 02:43:09,800
You just want $300?

5381
02:43:10,020 --> 02:43:12,400
I thought you were a monopoly player.

5382
02:43:12,400 --> 02:43:13,400
You still have more mortgages.

5383
02:43:13,620 --> 02:43:15,020
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5384
02:43:15,640 --> 02:43:19,000
You tell me right now, Ellum, who else can offer you $600 on the board?

5385
02:43:19,040 --> 02:43:19,820
Okay, wait, Ellum.

5386
02:43:19,860 --> 02:43:21,440
What if I gave you...

5387
02:43:21,440 --> 02:43:27,100
my property and my waterworks and the last railroad?

5388
02:43:28,420 --> 02:43:28,860
What?

5389
02:43:31,160 --> 02:43:32,280
I'm just saying, Ellum.

5390
02:43:32,280 --> 02:43:32,960
No, nothing.

5391
02:43:33,060 --> 02:43:34,160
I'm just about to die.

5392
02:43:34,400 --> 02:43:35,240
I mean, I have nothing.

5393
02:43:35,260 --> 02:43:37,340
What if, like, Kuhn and I give you everything?

5394
02:43:37,960 --> 02:43:38,780
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5395
02:43:38,820 --> 02:43:39,800
We can give you everything.

5396
02:43:39,800 --> 02:43:40,620
Yeah, we'll give you everything.

5397
02:43:41,020 --> 02:43:42,180
Just think about that.

5398
02:43:43,280 --> 02:43:44,400
Let's think about this, Ellum.

5399
02:43:44,400 --> 02:43:52,320
You're gonna take the deal of two desperate people with no properties or you're gonna take a deal from me, a successful businessman offering to double your money.

5400
02:43:52,440 --> 02:43:52,540
Look at this.

5401
02:43:53,140 --> 02:43:55,200
No, I bought a house in the countryside.

5402
02:43:55,300 --> 02:43:56,520
I'm ready to retire.

5403
02:43:57,160 --> 02:43:59,460
Look at my crazy offer here.

5404
02:43:59,780 --> 02:44:00,640
Yeah, look at this crazy offer.

5405
02:44:00,640 --> 02:44:03,080
I can't give you this, but here.

5406
02:44:04,080 --> 02:44:06,180
This is everything else that I have.

5407
02:44:06,180 --> 02:44:07,060
That's actually a lot of value.

5408
02:44:07,160 --> 02:44:07,980
That's a lot of value.

5409
02:44:10,280 --> 02:44:10,800
Yeah.

5410
02:44:10,920 --> 02:44:11,440
For what?

5411
02:44:11,540 --> 02:44:12,260
For 300 bucks?

5412
02:44:12,560 --> 02:44:14,500
No, just to win.

5413
02:44:14,880 --> 02:44:16,120
Okay, well sure then.

5414
02:44:17,160 --> 02:44:19,400
Yeah, just so you can win.

5415
02:44:19,560 --> 02:44:20,240
Just so I can win.

5416
02:44:21,020 --> 02:44:25,980
Imagine how much Sykkuno's pride is gonna hurt to lose against Ellum.

5417
02:44:26,380 --> 02:44:29,060
To lose in a 3v1 against Ellum?

5418
02:44:29,260 --> 02:44:30,280
I don't think I'd feel too bad.

5419
02:44:30,340 --> 02:44:30,920
What's your opt?

5420
02:44:31,860 --> 02:44:35,140
After all the hard work he's spent In a 3v1 against me?

5421
02:44:35,300 --> 02:44:36,580
to try and win this game.

5422
02:44:37,680 --> 02:44:39,460
I'll take the properties I get.

5423
02:44:40,420 --> 02:44:41,580
Well, here's the funny thing.

5424
02:44:41,740 --> 02:44:42,100
I'm going bankrupt.

5425
02:44:42,380 --> 02:44:44,500
Dude, you didn't even force Ellum to break the alliance.

5426
02:44:44,600 --> 02:44:45,480
Now we're just even stronger.

5427
02:44:46,880 --> 02:44:49,060
Now we're even stronger than before.

5428
02:44:49,300 --> 02:44:50,620
We're undefeatable now.

5429
02:44:50,880 --> 02:44:51,440
It's over.

5430
02:44:53,260 --> 02:44:54,760
Do you like Deku?

5431
02:44:54,940 --> 02:44:58,860
When you know it's like that possibility You can make him go plus ultra, but then they kind of latch onto it.

5432
02:44:58,940 --> 02:44:59,780
That's me and you right now.

5433
02:44:59,980 --> 02:45:01,120
We're going plus ultra.

5434
02:45:03,320 --> 02:45:04,180
Keep the mortgage.

5435
02:45:04,180 --> 02:45:05,200
Oh god.

5436
02:45:05,540 --> 02:45:06,780
Keep the mortgage.

5437
02:45:07,660 --> 02:45:08,620
Holy shit.

5438
02:45:09,540 --> 02:45:11,320
Wait, I only have 300 bucks?

5439
02:45:12,120 --> 02:45:15,320
Oh, it's because she bankrupted.

5440
02:45:15,760 --> 02:45:16,660
My money.

5441
02:45:17,660 --> 02:45:19,900
It's just like my 147 bucks you were doing.

5442
02:45:19,900 --> 02:45:20,720
No money allowed.

5443
02:45:21,980 --> 02:45:23,180
I'll tell you what, Ellum.

5444
02:45:23,280 --> 02:45:24,780
Let's up it to $600.

5445
02:45:26,240 --> 02:45:26,720
$600?

5446
02:45:27,960 --> 02:45:28,440
$147.

5447
02:45:29,300 --> 02:45:29,960
Ellum, listen.

5448
02:45:30,080 --> 02:45:33,160
You can listen to everyone else, but I'll tell you what, I'm a successful businessman.

5449
02:45:33,280 --> 02:45:34,040
I need to pay $500.

5450
02:45:34,380 --> 02:45:38,800
Who else on this planet right now, in this game, right now, can offer you $600?

5451
02:45:38,980 --> 02:45:40,000
Other than me.

5452
02:45:40,240 --> 02:45:43,040
Who you've seen has made $550 off of that.

5453
02:45:44,000 --> 02:45:46,840
I'm offering you a deal no one else can on this entire planet.

5454
02:45:47,020 --> 02:45:50,380
Wait, you already spent the money before I accepted.

5455
02:45:51,340 --> 02:45:55,000
That's because it's such a good deal that anyone with a brain would have accepted it.

5456
02:45:55,020 --> 02:45:56,960
You, Salah, you're quoting Wolf of Wall Street.

5457
02:45:57,200 --> 02:46:01,040
You, Salah, you're quoting Wolf of Wall Street.

5458
02:46:01,040 --> 02:46:01,340
I was so sure.

5459
02:46:01,580 --> 02:46:04,100
That if you'd accepted, that if you didn't, you'd be hurting.

5460
02:46:04,140 --> 02:46:04,580
Dude!

5461
02:46:05,480 --> 02:46:07,960
Yo, Ellum, this is it, bro!

5462
02:46:08,400 --> 02:46:09,280
This is it!

5463
02:46:10,540 --> 02:46:11,420
Huge comeback.

5464
02:46:12,040 --> 02:46:14,660
I got the highest KDA in this game, I'm just saying.

5465
02:46:15,980 --> 02:46:18,420
Winner, loser, I got the highest KDA is all I'm saying.

5466
02:46:18,640 --> 02:46:19,900
Jesus Christ.

5467
02:46:20,940 --> 02:46:21,380
That's it.

5468
02:46:21,940 --> 02:46:22,800
You see, Ellum?

5469
02:46:22,860 --> 02:46:23,720
You want that $600?

5470
02:46:23,960 --> 02:46:25,040
I just got you $750.

5471
02:46:26,140 --> 02:46:26,580
$750.

5472
02:46:26,580 --> 02:46:27,680
I want it in cash.

5473
02:46:29,320 --> 02:46:31,480
But unfortunately, no one is paying in cash.

5474
02:46:31,580 --> 02:46:33,060
They're paying in alternate methods.

5475
02:46:33,200 --> 02:46:34,240
It's really awkward, actually.

5476
02:46:35,780 --> 02:46:37,480
I mean, they ain't giving me this cash.

5477
02:46:37,500 --> 02:46:38,880
I can't give it to you either.

5478
02:46:38,960 --> 02:46:40,260
I don't really know what to do with that.

5479
02:46:40,320 --> 02:46:40,740
Oh, God.

5480
02:46:43,520 --> 02:46:45,460
Did she even give you the jail card?

5481
02:46:45,640 --> 02:46:46,140
That's crazy.

5482
02:46:47,800 --> 02:46:49,360
She's giving me everything she has.

5483
02:46:50,180 --> 02:46:50,900
Oh, God.

5484
02:46:51,160 --> 02:46:52,380
Dude, where did it go so wrong?

5485
02:46:52,420 --> 02:46:55,600
I feel like we were so down bad, and then suddenly he got switched in one turn.

5486
02:46:56,080 --> 02:47:00,620
I mean, it just was that one landing on your blue, and then they both landed on my orange, and it kind of finished it off.

5487
02:47:00,620 --> 02:47:03,300
It's alright, because Sykuno gets nothing from me.

5488
02:47:03,720 --> 02:47:05,940
Wait, I'm going to pay to remortgage this?

5489
02:47:06,700 --> 02:47:08,600
Wait, I'm going to repay the mor...

5490
02:47:09,320 --> 02:47:13,920
Or you keep the mortgage, but you don't do anything with it.

5491
02:47:14,480 --> 02:47:15,580
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5492
02:47:15,600 --> 02:47:16,820
I would just not repay it.

5493
02:47:16,840 --> 02:47:17,680
It has no houses, anyway.

5494
02:47:17,960 --> 02:47:19,360
Yeah, it has nothing on it.

5495
02:47:19,560 --> 02:47:20,060
Wait a second.

5496
02:47:21,780 --> 02:47:25,940
So now that I go bankrupt, Sykuno gets nothing from me.

5497
02:47:26,920 --> 02:47:28,000
Dude, it's actual...

5498
02:47:28,680 --> 02:47:30,280
Actual everyone's against me.

5499
02:47:30,760 --> 02:47:32,820
But I'll tell you what, I got the highest pay.

5500
02:47:32,820 --> 02:47:33,680
I got one dollar.

5501
02:47:33,880 --> 02:47:37,400
If I land on his one, I land on his fucking one.

5502
02:47:37,640 --> 02:47:39,380
Are you actually joking?

5503
02:47:39,800 --> 02:47:41,440
There is no way that I'm gonna...

5504
02:47:41,440 --> 02:47:42,760
No, no, no.

5505
02:47:43,140 --> 02:47:44,460
Give me the money back.

5506
02:47:44,640 --> 02:47:47,500
No, no, no.

5507
02:47:48,440 --> 02:47:49,500
No, no, no.

5508
02:47:49,520 --> 02:47:52,200
No, you give me the money back.

5509
02:47:52,200 --> 02:47:53,420
Give me the money back.

5510
02:47:53,460 --> 02:47:55,260
You promised me you would give me the money.

5511
02:47:55,940 --> 02:48:00,700
No, I won't send it right back, but you do have to mortgage some stuff, otherwise, like, you know, it might be over.

5512
02:48:00,740 --> 02:48:02,960
Wait, everything's already...

5513
02:48:03,440 --> 02:48:04,200
Oh shit.

5514
02:48:06,540 --> 02:48:07,720
Wait a second.

5515
02:48:08,660 --> 02:48:09,100
Guys.

5516
02:48:11,720 --> 02:48:12,160
Mortgage?

5517
02:48:12,560 --> 02:48:14,100
You chose your alliance.

5518
02:48:14,660 --> 02:48:17,720
You knew exactly how it was gonna go with that alliance.

5519
02:48:18,020 --> 02:48:18,560
Wait, guys.

5520
02:48:20,460 --> 02:48:20,900
Guys.

5521
02:48:22,020 --> 02:48:22,460
Guys.

5522
02:48:23,540 --> 02:48:23,980
Guys.

5523
02:48:26,320 --> 02:48:28,060
You're gonna have to mortgage some houses.

5524
02:48:28,080 --> 02:48:30,760
I'm not gonna lie, but it is for the good of the nation.

5525
02:48:31,060 --> 02:48:32,580
And now you'll give it back to me, right?

5526
02:48:34,080 --> 02:48:39,140
Well, I said I'd give it back to you, but now that you've allied with Dokian Heu...

5527
02:48:39,140 --> 02:48:40,940
I didn't know you'd give me my money.

5528
02:48:41,200 --> 02:48:44,000
Give me my $700,000 back.

5529
02:48:44,160 --> 02:48:45,260
I didn't bring the money.

5530
02:48:45,400 --> 02:48:46,740
Give me my money back.

5531
02:48:47,180 --> 02:48:48,700
You broke the alliance first.

5532
02:48:49,180 --> 02:48:51,760
I'd give my partner the money back.

5533
02:48:51,840 --> 02:48:53,920
You gave me the money back.

5534
02:48:54,940 --> 02:48:56,200
You took their property!

5535
02:48:56,540 --> 02:48:57,520
They gave it to me!

5536
02:48:57,520 --> 02:48:58,200
They forced me!

5537
02:48:58,480 --> 02:49:00,180
They handed me the contract in the post!

5538
02:49:00,460 --> 02:49:02,080
You could have rejected the deal!

5539
02:49:02,200 --> 02:49:04,500
I didn't have the option!

5540
02:49:04,620 --> 02:49:05,460
I didn't have the option!

5541
02:49:06,220 --> 02:49:06,780
There's no way!

5542
02:49:07,080 --> 02:49:07,700
There's literally no way!

5543
02:49:08,740 --> 02:49:10,560
Are you actually joking right now?

5544
02:49:10,600 --> 02:49:11,580
You're spending my money!

5545
02:49:11,800 --> 02:49:12,560
Right in front of me!

5546
02:49:13,260 --> 02:49:14,480
That's my money!

5547
02:49:15,060 --> 02:49:17,700
I'm spending my company's money that you left!

5548
02:49:17,920 --> 02:49:20,780
That I didn't leave when I didn't hand in my notice period!

5549
02:49:21,040 --> 02:49:21,780
Show me the contract!

5550
02:49:22,000 --> 02:49:22,800
You could have said no!

5551
02:49:24,240 --> 02:49:25,280
Everyone is saying rolled!

5552
02:49:25,460 --> 02:49:26,260
I'm not being rolled!

5553
02:49:26,440 --> 02:49:31,600
You accepted the 3v1!

5554
02:49:31,660 --> 02:49:33,560
I would have had an honourable battle at the end!

5555
02:49:34,080 --> 02:49:36,740
But you accepted the 3v1 battle!

5556
02:49:37,360 --> 02:49:38,420
You betrayed first!

5557
02:49:38,420 --> 02:49:40,540
You just said that me and you were getting stronger!

5558
02:49:40,660 --> 02:49:41,600
Because they gave it to me for free!

5559
02:49:41,660 --> 02:49:42,640
Because they didn't even accept the deal!

5560
02:49:43,060 --> 02:49:43,440
You're right!

5561
02:49:43,440 --> 02:49:44,140
We both win!

5562
02:49:45,640 --> 02:49:46,720
So give me my money!

5563
02:49:47,160 --> 02:49:49,540
If I get a 3, so fucking hell with me!

5564
02:49:50,900 --> 02:49:51,520
Oh my god!

5565
02:49:52,800 --> 02:49:53,680
I just missed!

5566
02:49:54,100 --> 02:49:55,160
Oh my god!

5567
02:49:56,700 --> 02:49:58,760
We could just both quit the game now!

5568
02:49:58,800 --> 02:49:59,460
And we both win!

5569
02:49:59,480 --> 02:50:00,700
You first!

5570
02:50:01,500 --> 02:50:03,480
Let's just both quit the game and we both win!

5571
02:50:03,720 --> 02:50:05,000
Why don't you guys do a countdown?

5572
02:50:05,320 --> 02:50:08,720
I'll do a countdown and then you both quit the game at the same time!

5573
02:50:09,020 --> 02:50:09,400
Yeah sure!

5574
02:50:11,080 --> 02:50:12,840
I'll do the countdown guys!

5575
02:50:14,140 --> 02:50:14,580
5...

5576
02:50:15,480 --> 02:50:15,920
4...

5577
02:50:16,760 --> 02:50:17,200
3...

5578
02:50:17,860 --> 02:50:18,300
2...

5579
02:50:20,960 --> 02:50:21,400
1...

5580
02:50:22,960 --> 02:50:23,460
2...

5581
02:50:23,460 --> 02:50:24,460
You guys are still playing!

5582
02:50:24,640 --> 02:50:26,320
You could just quit when you both win...

5583
02:50:26,320 --> 02:50:29,180
Yeah it makes sense but...

5584
02:50:29,180 --> 02:50:31,680
Are you fucking kidding me bro?

5585
02:50:31,780 --> 02:50:34,300
You could literally just quit right now!

5586
02:50:34,520 --> 02:50:35,940
Let me get another countdown!

5587
02:50:36,160 --> 02:50:38,240
Oh guys did you, is it because I lagged?

5588
02:50:38,260 --> 02:50:39,420
I'll do another countdown!

5589
02:50:40,220 --> 02:50:40,720
5...

5590
02:50:41,860 --> 02:50:42,360
4...

5591
02:50:42,360 --> 02:50:42,940
3, 2...

5592
02:50:45,320 --> 02:50:45,820
1...

5593
02:50:45,820 --> 02:50:46,740
Did you mortgage this one?

5594
02:50:46,860 --> 02:50:48,340
Oh, it's the one not mortgaged.

5595
02:50:48,340 --> 02:50:49,720
Give me my 22 bucks.

5596
02:50:49,720 --> 02:50:53,460
If I land on the blue though, I'm actually going to be in trouble, dude.

5597
02:50:53,540 --> 02:50:54,120
This is going to be...

5598
02:50:54,120 --> 02:50:56,380
Please, I pray you get completely screwed.

5599
02:50:56,740 --> 02:50:57,460
I pray.

5600
02:50:57,720 --> 02:50:59,840
I am praying on your downfall.

5601
02:50:59,840 --> 02:51:01,780
Dude, it's a 3v1 at this point.

5602
02:51:01,820 --> 02:51:02,460
I'm the underdog.

5603
02:51:02,480 --> 02:51:04,420
I am praying on your literal downfall right now.

5604
02:51:04,500 --> 02:51:06,320
What happened to the alliance, guys?

5605
02:51:06,560 --> 02:51:07,520
Oh, that shit is bugged.

5606
02:51:08,020 --> 02:51:09,040
That shit has bugged.

5607
02:51:09,300 --> 02:51:10,460
The alliance is just gone.

5608
02:51:10,680 --> 02:51:12,320
I am going for your jugular.

5609
02:51:12,320 --> 02:51:13,720
The alliance is just gone like that?

5610
02:51:13,720 --> 02:51:17,500
For your jugular like a goddamn pitbull right now, bro.

5611
02:51:17,740 --> 02:51:18,960
I bet you guys were voting.

5612
02:51:19,640 --> 02:51:23,400
I'll tell you what, I could buy this property, but I'll auction it to be fair.

5613
02:51:23,840 --> 02:51:24,460
How's that sound?

5614
02:51:24,620 --> 02:51:25,960
You're an asshole, bro.

5615
02:51:26,060 --> 02:51:27,500
I have 99 bucks.

5616
02:51:27,680 --> 02:51:28,440
What do you mean?

5617
02:51:29,720 --> 02:51:31,400
Just withdraw because he paid me.

5618
02:51:31,480 --> 02:51:32,680
Just withdraw from it.

5619
02:51:32,820 --> 02:51:33,760
He's done it because I can't.

5620
02:51:33,900 --> 02:51:35,700
He just outbid me in one...

5621
02:51:36,600 --> 02:51:38,160
Now that's how you do business.

5622
02:51:38,980 --> 02:51:40,020
I gave you a fair shot.

5623
02:51:40,240 --> 02:51:41,140
You mean you gave me a fair shot?

5624
02:51:41,300 --> 02:51:42,360
What do you mean you gave me a fair shot?

5625
02:51:42,560 --> 02:51:42,900
What do you...

5626
02:51:43,940 --> 02:51:45,760
Dude, if I land on that blue one, I swear, I pray.

5627
02:51:45,960 --> 02:51:48,520
He might land on your blue one.

5628
02:51:48,580 --> 02:51:49,140
You never know.

5629
02:51:49,320 --> 02:51:50,180
Oh, he's safe.

5630
02:51:50,920 --> 02:51:51,980
I don't want a double.

5631
02:51:52,100 --> 02:51:53,140
I don't want a double.

5632
02:51:53,200 --> 02:51:55,320
Dude, if I land on that blue though, I'm actually into so much.

5633
02:51:55,340 --> 02:51:56,160
Give me my 200 bucks.

5634
02:51:56,220 --> 02:51:56,680
Give me my 200 bucks.

5635
02:51:57,140 --> 02:51:57,740
Dude, you know what?

5636
02:51:57,780 --> 02:51:58,700
Actually, honestly, hang on.

5637
02:51:58,760 --> 02:51:59,060
I've got an idea.

5638
02:51:59,180 --> 02:51:59,580
I've got an idea.

5639
02:52:00,020 --> 02:52:02,620
Just because I want him to land on this so freaking badly.

5640
02:52:02,780 --> 02:52:03,140
Oh, no.

5641
02:52:05,980 --> 02:52:06,580
No, no, no.

5642
02:52:06,640 --> 02:52:07,540
You can get on mortgage it.

5643
02:52:08,800 --> 02:52:09,320
How do I...

5644
02:52:09,320 --> 02:52:10,360
Why can I not...

5645
02:52:11,420 --> 02:52:12,020
I want to...

5646
02:52:12,020 --> 02:52:13,640
You have to pay for the mortgage.

5647
02:52:14,140 --> 02:52:15,320
I don't want to pay for the mortgage.

5648
02:52:15,440 --> 02:52:15,720
But you have to pay for the mortgage.

5649
02:52:15,780 --> 02:52:16,100
No.

5650
02:52:16,340 --> 02:52:17,020
Then don't.

5651
02:52:17,060 --> 02:52:18,160
I want to manage my properties.

5652
02:52:18,380 --> 02:52:18,940
That's like Kuno's property.

5653
02:52:19,020 --> 02:52:20,140
Wait, I own that one.

5654
02:52:20,220 --> 02:52:20,480
I own that one.

5655
02:52:20,480 --> 02:52:20,740
Oh, yeah.

5656
02:52:20,800 --> 02:52:21,140
No, hey.

5657
02:52:21,200 --> 02:52:22,000
That's like Kuno's property.

5658
02:52:22,040 --> 02:52:23,720
And I wish you luck for when you land on this.

5659
02:52:23,740 --> 02:52:25,060
I wish you luck for when you land on this, okay?

5660
02:52:25,180 --> 02:52:26,000
Holy Jesus, bro.

5661
02:52:26,040 --> 02:52:26,900
Thank you so much.

5662
02:52:27,100 --> 02:52:27,840
Thank you so much.

5663
02:52:27,980 --> 02:52:28,880
1,400?

5664
02:52:29,000 --> 02:52:30,580
I think that actually would end the game.

5665
02:52:31,340 --> 02:52:31,660
Thank you so much.

5666
02:52:31,660 --> 02:52:33,300
I mean, at this point, it comes down to the roll.

5667
02:52:33,300 --> 02:52:34,560
Oh, it comes down to this last roll.

5668
02:52:34,720 --> 02:52:36,760
Oh, the roll is going to be...

5669
02:52:36,760 --> 02:52:37,220
No!

5670
02:52:37,400 --> 02:52:37,720
No!

5671
02:52:38,600 --> 02:52:38,920
No!

5672
02:52:39,000 --> 02:52:39,360
Wait a minute.

5673
02:52:39,480 --> 02:52:39,940
Wait a second.

5674
02:52:40,000 --> 02:52:40,400
He lives.

5675
02:52:40,720 --> 02:52:40,980
Wait.

5676
02:52:41,980 --> 02:52:42,960
Wait, that puts me on...

5677
02:52:42,960 --> 02:52:44,180
One past it!

5678
02:52:44,360 --> 02:52:45,580
He actually lives!

5679
02:52:48,460 --> 02:52:49,100
That's dangerous.

5680
02:52:49,360 --> 02:52:50,820
That's a dangerous one, man.

5681
02:52:51,200 --> 02:52:51,520
Brother!

5682
02:52:52,120 --> 02:52:53,640
I hope you roll a 10 or an 11.

5683
02:52:53,640 --> 02:52:54,060
Oh, my God.

5684
02:52:54,080 --> 02:52:54,540
I'm going to cry.

5685
02:52:54,660 --> 02:52:56,520
It would be so beautiful to land a 10 or 11 here.

5686
02:52:57,240 --> 02:52:57,960
I'm fine, right?

5687
02:52:58,120 --> 02:52:58,760
Fine, right?

5688
02:52:59,560 --> 02:53:00,140
Fine, right?

5689
02:53:00,260 --> 02:53:01,260
What property is that?

5690
02:53:01,780 --> 02:53:02,800
I think it's mine, actually.

5691
02:53:02,920 --> 02:53:03,240
Oh!

5692
02:53:03,680 --> 02:53:04,000
Sometimes...

5693
02:53:04,500 --> 02:53:06,480
Oh, as long as I get past it.

5694
02:53:06,500 --> 02:53:07,360
As long as I get past it, that's fine.

5695
02:53:07,600 --> 02:53:08,840
Just got to get past the danger.

5696
02:53:08,840 --> 02:53:08,960
I mean, you have to...

5697
02:53:08,960 --> 02:53:10,960
Dude, you have to roll so low here.

5698
02:53:11,080 --> 02:53:12,320
You have to be past four.

5699
02:53:15,100 --> 02:53:17,860
The only way Sykkuno can get fucked is if he gets...

5700
02:53:17,860 --> 02:53:18,160
Wait, no.

5701
02:53:18,200 --> 02:53:18,540
This is funny.

5702
02:53:19,000 --> 02:53:22,960
The only way Sykkuno can get fucked is if he gets a card that takes him to boardwalk.

5703
02:53:23,480 --> 02:53:25,000
Yeah, that would be the one way to lose.

5704
02:53:25,120 --> 02:53:25,700
Yeah, that would be...

5705
02:53:25,700 --> 02:53:27,140
That would be a funny one.

5706
02:53:27,300 --> 02:53:27,620
Heartbreaking.

5707
02:53:27,980 --> 02:53:28,560
Dude, come on.

5708
02:53:28,600 --> 02:53:29,500
Give him a 3-4.

5709
02:53:29,540 --> 02:53:29,780
Please.

5710
02:53:29,940 --> 02:53:30,540
3-4.

5711
02:53:30,660 --> 02:53:31,140
3-4.

5712
02:53:31,640 --> 02:53:32,160
3-4.

5713
02:53:32,160 --> 02:53:32,460
3 -4 right here.

5714
02:53:32,460 --> 02:53:34,280
For the love of God, you give me a 3-4, I'm going to lose my...

5715
02:53:34,280 --> 02:53:35,460
I will lose my fucking life.

5716
02:53:35,460 --> 02:53:35,660
3-4.

5717
02:53:35,720 --> 02:53:35,980
3-4.

5718
02:53:36,060 --> 02:53:36,200
Two!

5719
02:53:36,380 --> 02:53:36,800
Oh, my God.

5720
02:53:36,820 --> 02:53:36,980
Yes.

5721
02:53:36,980 --> 02:53:37,320
Dang it.

5722
02:53:37,320 --> 02:53:37,620
Dang it.

5723
02:53:37,660 --> 02:53:38,180
Oh, my God.

5724
02:53:38,260 --> 02:53:39,040
That two looks good.

5725
02:53:39,600 --> 02:53:41,100
That two looks good at first.

5726
02:53:41,320 --> 02:53:41,960
Oh, my God.

5727
02:53:41,960 --> 02:53:42,320
That is mine.

5728
02:53:42,320 --> 02:53:42,720
That is mine.

5729
02:53:42,780 --> 02:53:43,600
Oh, Jesus Christ.

5730
02:53:43,640 --> 02:53:43,860
Yes.

5731
02:53:44,060 --> 02:53:44,380
Yes.

5732
02:53:44,380 --> 02:53:44,660
Yes.

5733
02:53:44,800 --> 02:53:46,660
Dude, it's just whoever lands on the next one.

5734
02:53:46,700 --> 02:53:47,140
It's GG.

5735
02:53:48,160 --> 02:53:48,480
Six.

5736
02:53:49,660 --> 02:53:50,640
Next landing is it.

5737
02:53:51,360 --> 02:53:53,160
Yeah, but you have a long way to go.

5738
02:53:53,900 --> 02:53:54,320
That's me.

5739
02:53:54,360 --> 02:53:54,660
That's me.

5740
02:53:54,800 --> 02:53:55,120
No!

5741
02:53:56,280 --> 02:53:56,980
Oh, it's mortgage.

5742
02:53:57,380 --> 02:53:58,700
It's the battle of the mortgage.

5743
02:53:58,720 --> 02:53:59,300
Send me the Joe.

5744
02:53:59,340 --> 02:53:59,960
Send me the Joe.

5745
02:53:59,980 --> 02:54:02,500
It's just all going to come down to if I land on the blue or for you to land on the blue.

5746
02:54:02,500 --> 02:54:02,820
Oh, wait.

5747
02:54:02,820 --> 02:54:03,040
Shit.

5748
02:54:03,140 --> 02:54:03,640
This is bad.

5749
02:54:03,700 --> 02:54:04,060
This is bad.

5750
02:54:04,080 --> 02:54:04,420
This is bad.

5751
02:54:04,540 --> 02:54:04,900
This is bad.

5752
02:54:04,900 --> 02:54:06,380
It's going to go closer to my property.

5753
02:54:06,880 --> 02:54:08,360
I love what you're doing.

5754
02:54:08,360 --> 02:54:08,800
No, please.

5755
02:54:09,040 --> 02:54:09,620
Send me to jail.

5756
02:54:09,640 --> 02:54:10,240
Send me to jail.

5757
02:54:10,540 --> 02:54:11,260
Don't go to jail.

5758
02:54:11,340 --> 02:54:11,960
Don't go to jail.

5759
02:54:12,080 --> 02:54:12,400
No.

5760
02:54:13,080 --> 02:54:13,780
Another double.

5761
02:54:13,840 --> 02:54:13,980
Yes.

5762
02:54:13,980 --> 02:54:15,360
Dude, there's no way, bro.

5763
02:54:15,480 --> 02:54:16,620
Big, big, big.

5764
02:54:16,860 --> 02:54:17,840
There's actually not.

5765
02:54:17,940 --> 02:54:18,400
Oh, please.

5766
02:54:18,480 --> 02:54:18,760
Please.

5767
02:54:18,760 --> 02:54:18,920
Please.

5768
02:54:18,920 --> 02:54:19,080
You're good.

5769
02:54:20,260 --> 02:54:20,620
No.

5770
02:54:20,840 --> 02:54:21,200
Yes.

5771
02:54:21,200 --> 02:54:21,920
Oh, my God.

5772
02:54:21,920 --> 02:54:22,680
What is this RNG?

5773
02:54:22,940 --> 02:54:23,300
Yes.

5774
02:54:23,320 --> 02:54:24,080
What is this RNG?

5775
02:54:24,380 --> 02:54:24,740
Yes.

5776
02:54:25,160 --> 02:54:25,760
Oh, my God.

5777
02:54:25,880 --> 02:54:26,480
Low roll.

5778
02:54:26,500 --> 02:54:27,020
Low roll, please.

5779
02:54:27,100 --> 02:54:27,560
For the low roll.

5780
02:54:27,680 --> 02:54:28,140
Low roll.

5781
02:54:28,160 --> 02:54:28,360
Low roll.

5782
02:54:28,360 --> 02:54:28,760
Low roll.

5783
02:54:28,760 --> 02:54:33,000
Low roll.

5784
02:54:34,040 --> 02:54:34,400
Not jail.

5785
02:54:34,400 --> 02:54:35,800
Isn't that the middle, like, weird one?

5786
02:54:35,960 --> 02:54:36,420
It is.

5787
02:54:36,480 --> 02:54:37,140
Yeah, that's the weird one.

5788
02:54:37,160 --> 02:54:37,940
I think you lose some money.

5789
02:54:38,100 --> 02:54:38,420
Oh.

5790
02:54:38,620 --> 02:54:38,720
Oh.

5791
02:54:39,140 --> 02:54:39,500
Oh, 100.

5792
02:54:40,600 --> 02:54:42,140
Still, overall, plus 100.

5793
02:54:42,260 --> 02:54:43,960
I mean, you got 200, lost 100.

5794
02:54:44,360 --> 02:54:45,240
It's your turn.

5795
02:54:45,300 --> 02:54:46,260
You almost got to jail.

5796
02:54:46,260 --> 02:54:47,300
As long as I don't land on that blue, I'm chilling.

5797
02:54:48,660 --> 02:54:49,020
Shit.

5798
02:54:49,140 --> 02:54:49,680
It's bad.

5799
02:54:49,720 --> 02:54:50,000
It's bad.

5800
02:54:50,180 --> 02:54:50,760
That's nice.

5801
02:54:50,980 --> 02:54:51,360
No, man.

5802
02:54:51,360 --> 02:54:52,660
You got another 200, though.

5803
02:54:53,040 --> 02:54:53,880
That's not good.

5804
02:54:54,160 --> 02:54:54,980
Free parking.

5805
02:54:55,960 --> 02:54:56,680
Come on.

5806
02:54:56,680 --> 02:54:58,000
We need them to land on an orange.

5807
02:54:58,500 --> 02:54:59,160
This is orange.

5808
02:54:59,160 --> 02:54:59,480
This is orange.

5809
02:55:00,120 --> 02:55:00,480
Orange.

5810
02:55:00,480 --> 02:55:00,560
Orange.

5811
02:55:00,820 --> 02:55:00,900
Orange.

5812
02:55:01,060 --> 02:55:03,520
Dude, why is it always giving me doubles the whole time?

5813
02:55:03,700 --> 02:55:04,340
Like, what is...

5814
02:55:04,340 --> 02:55:04,760
Wait, hang on.

5815
02:55:04,800 --> 02:55:05,660
If that's a tax, I'm going to lose my money.

5816
02:55:05,660 --> 02:55:05,740
That's not a double.

5817
02:55:05,980 --> 02:55:06,420
That's a five.

5818
02:55:06,820 --> 02:55:07,500
That's a five.

5819
02:55:08,580 --> 02:55:08,900
Wait.

5820
02:55:10,560 --> 02:55:11,960
No way I gave you 60 bucks.

5821
02:55:12,200 --> 02:55:12,560
Wait, I have houses there.

5822
02:55:12,860 --> 02:55:14,040
Why does he have houses there?

5823
02:55:14,200 --> 02:55:15,880
That's the hoon's houses.

5824
02:55:16,000 --> 02:55:16,680
You know what, bro?

5825
02:55:16,720 --> 02:55:17,340
Enjoy that.

5826
02:55:17,360 --> 02:55:17,820
Enjoy that.

5827
02:55:17,880 --> 02:55:19,320
Because that grenade's going to go off.

5828
02:55:19,320 --> 02:55:21,020
That grenade's going to go off in your face, bro.

5829
02:55:21,080 --> 02:55:21,340
Okay?

5830
02:55:21,420 --> 02:55:22,080
That grenade's going to go off in your face.

5831
02:55:22,080 --> 02:55:24,080
Whoever lands on the next big one, it's GG.

5832
02:55:24,660 --> 02:55:25,300
Holy Christ.

5833
02:55:25,500 --> 02:55:25,800
Please.

5834
02:55:25,920 --> 02:55:27,660
But the thing is, your time has come.

5835
02:55:27,680 --> 02:55:28,960
Roll them as close to the...

5836
02:55:28,960 --> 02:55:29,500
Roll low, roll low.

5837
02:55:29,500 --> 02:55:30,240
Yeah, the...

5838
02:55:30,240 --> 02:55:30,700
Yeah.

5839
02:55:30,760 --> 02:55:31,240
Not bad.

5840
02:55:31,260 --> 02:55:31,700
Not bad.

5841
02:55:31,700 --> 02:55:33,460
Oh, I think he owns this one, right?

5842
02:55:33,700 --> 02:55:34,500
Don't you own this one?

5843
02:55:34,700 --> 02:55:34,900
Or...

5844
02:55:35,380 --> 02:55:36,120
Is it mortgage?

5845
02:55:36,860 --> 02:55:37,860
No, you own that.

5846
02:55:38,040 --> 02:55:39,240
Oh, you own that one.

5847
02:55:39,520 --> 02:55:40,180
Okay, not bad.

5848
02:55:40,300 --> 02:55:41,240
Low roll, low roll, low roll.

5849
02:55:41,240 --> 02:55:42,640
I just got to keep rolling low and not hit.

5850
02:55:42,960 --> 02:55:44,280
Low roll, brethren.

5851
02:55:44,540 --> 02:55:44,880
Low roll.

5852
02:55:44,920 --> 02:55:45,340
That's not low.

5853
02:55:45,380 --> 02:55:45,780
That's not low.

5854
02:55:45,820 --> 02:55:46,120
That's too big.

5855
02:55:46,300 --> 02:55:46,860
That's too big.

5856
02:55:47,140 --> 02:55:47,760
That's too big.

5857
02:55:47,960 --> 02:55:48,480
That's too big.

5858
02:55:48,520 --> 02:55:49,380
That's so good for you, though.

5859
02:55:49,400 --> 02:55:50,380
You're right before the oranges.

5860
02:55:50,500 --> 02:55:52,100
So you have a high chance of making it through.

5861
02:55:52,140 --> 02:55:52,600
Oh my God.

5862
02:55:52,620 --> 02:55:52,740
Yes.

5863
02:55:52,960 --> 02:55:53,280
Yes.

5864
02:55:53,280 --> 02:55:53,560
Yes.

5865
02:55:53,560 --> 02:55:53,880
And that's good.

5866
02:55:54,140 --> 02:55:54,460
Oh.

5867
02:55:54,460 --> 02:55:54,660
Yes.

5868
02:55:54,700 --> 02:55:55,500
It's your turn.

5869
02:55:55,500 --> 02:55:56,460
Dude, I'm getting...

5870
02:55:56,460 --> 02:55:58,900
I could land on a blue ride.

5871
02:55:59,000 --> 02:55:59,020
Wait.

5872
02:55:59,220 --> 02:55:59,900
Oh, okay.

5873
02:56:00,040 --> 02:56:00,500
It's a double.

5874
02:56:00,640 --> 02:56:01,260
Okay, not bad.

5875
02:56:01,260 --> 02:56:01,600
Not bad.

5876
02:56:01,860 --> 02:56:02,440
That's fine.

5877
02:56:02,620 --> 02:56:03,900
I'm right before the blues.

5878
02:56:04,280 --> 02:56:07,760
I'd have to get such an unlucky roll to land on a blue at this point.

5879
02:56:07,920 --> 02:56:08,420
What number?

5880
02:56:09,040 --> 02:56:11,020
I have to roll for less than four.

5881
02:56:11,500 --> 02:56:12,400
Yeah, like a four.

5882
02:56:12,540 --> 02:56:13,000
Oh, yes.

5883
02:56:15,060 --> 02:56:16,140
Oh my God.

5884
02:56:16,260 --> 02:56:16,820
No way.

5885
02:56:17,420 --> 02:56:17,960
It's over.

5886
02:56:18,260 --> 02:56:18,800
No way.

5887
02:56:18,840 --> 02:56:20,480
That's such an unlucky roll.

5888
02:56:20,520 --> 02:56:21,460
Hold that big L, you.

5889
02:56:21,620 --> 02:56:22,980
That's such an unlucky roll.

5890
02:56:23,100 --> 02:56:24,720
There's got to be something I can do.

5891
02:56:24,980 --> 02:56:25,380
Yes.

5892
02:56:25,880 --> 02:56:26,280
14.

5893
02:56:26,280 --> 02:56:27,160
1,400 bucks.

5894
02:56:27,400 --> 02:56:27,920
Okay, okay.

5895
02:56:27,920 --> 02:56:29,640
1,400 bucks.

5896
02:56:30,560 --> 02:56:32,480
Wow, you are so back in business.

5897
02:56:33,040 --> 02:56:34,620
You're absolutely so back.

5898
02:56:34,880 --> 02:56:35,800
Dude, we're so back.

5899
02:56:35,800 --> 02:56:37,080
Surely there's something I can do.

5900
02:56:37,220 --> 02:56:37,580
Yes.

5901
02:56:37,580 --> 02:56:39,000
You have to un-mortgage L.

5902
02:56:39,020 --> 02:56:39,440
Yes.

5903
02:56:39,560 --> 02:56:41,040
You have to un-mortgage your stuff with this.

5904
02:56:41,100 --> 02:56:42,960
Yes, we are so back.

5905
02:56:42,960 --> 02:56:44,080
And surround Sykuno.

5906
02:56:45,760 --> 02:56:47,500
We are so back.

5907
02:56:48,560 --> 02:56:49,680
1,400.

5908
02:56:50,560 --> 02:56:51,680
1,400?

5909
02:56:51,760 --> 02:56:53,320
1,400, dude.

5910
02:56:53,460 --> 02:56:53,760
Yeah.

5911
02:56:53,760 --> 02:56:55,200
1,400 bucks right there, dude.

5912
02:56:55,200 --> 02:56:55,700
That's even possible.

5913
02:56:55,760 --> 02:56:59,380
I mean, I'll try to play it out, but I feel like I lose.

5914
02:56:59,740 --> 02:57:00,940
No, no, you can do it with the hotels.

5915
02:57:01,180 --> 02:57:02,060
You know, you could get rid of those.

5916
02:57:02,300 --> 02:57:03,400
Yeah, you gotta get rid of the hotels.

5917
02:57:03,400 --> 02:57:06,180
But if I get rid of the hotels, I lose anyway, so it's like...

5918
02:57:06,180 --> 02:57:06,880
Well, not necessarily.

5919
02:57:08,100 --> 02:57:09,200
Yeah, you might have a chance.

5920
02:57:09,420 --> 02:57:10,620
I definitely lose, Syk.

5921
02:57:10,720 --> 02:57:14,260
If I don't have at least a few times, that ain't come back to me.

5922
02:57:14,260 --> 02:57:15,780
Dude, the doki plan worked.

5923
02:57:15,880 --> 02:57:17,700
The doki plan worked.

5924
02:57:18,160 --> 02:57:19,400
Dude, the orange Jesus.

5925
02:57:19,600 --> 02:57:20,340
That's crazy.

5926
02:57:22,500 --> 02:57:23,300
There's a 1PG.

5927
02:57:23,300 --> 02:57:24,940
Give me my money, baby.

5928
02:57:25,960 --> 02:57:27,480
Give me my money.

5929
02:57:28,280 --> 02:57:28,720
Excellent.

5930
02:57:28,980 --> 02:57:29,580
Is it even possible?

5931
02:57:30,460 --> 02:57:30,980
Yeah, yeah.

5932
02:57:30,980 --> 02:57:31,620
I can get rid of it.

5933
02:57:31,780 --> 02:57:32,440
That's so...

5934
02:57:32,440 --> 02:57:34,200
I mean, if you land on that, it's still pretty lethal.

5935
02:57:34,320 --> 02:57:36,500
7,750 is pretty punchy.

5936
02:57:37,420 --> 02:57:37,860
Okay.

5937
02:57:37,880 --> 02:57:40,360
I mean, that's enough, but at this point, it's just...

5938
02:57:40,360 --> 02:57:41,300
Dude, look at that.

5939
02:57:41,540 --> 02:57:42,520
Oh, my God.

5940
02:57:42,800 --> 02:57:43,280
Oh, my God.

5941
02:57:43,880 --> 02:57:47,260
See where he is and un-mortgage all the stuff on that pathway.

5942
02:57:47,580 --> 02:57:48,380
Yeah, actually.

5943
02:57:49,680 --> 02:57:50,120
Jesus.

5944
02:57:50,360 --> 02:57:52,680
Go to your property and un-mortgage everything.

5945
02:57:52,700 --> 02:57:53,560
No way.

5946
02:57:53,560 --> 02:57:54,780
He rolled past it again.

5947
02:57:54,880 --> 02:57:54,920
Yes.

5948
02:57:55,820 --> 02:57:56,420
Oh, my God.

5949
02:57:56,620 --> 02:57:58,880
I mean, it just comes down to pure luck at this point.

5950
02:57:58,980 --> 02:57:59,060
Oh, I can feel it.

5951
02:57:59,120 --> 02:57:59,440
Wait.

5952
02:58:00,140 --> 02:58:00,720
No, it's fine.

5953
02:58:00,960 --> 02:58:01,260
Oh, man.

5954
02:58:01,520 --> 02:58:02,620
Un-mortgage railroad.

5955
02:58:03,580 --> 02:58:03,840
All right.

5956
02:58:03,920 --> 02:58:05,060
Remember to un-mortgage.

5957
02:58:05,140 --> 02:58:06,920
Go to my properties and un-mortgage.

5958
02:58:06,940 --> 02:58:07,480
Yeah, yeah.

5959
02:58:07,500 --> 02:58:07,960
You got to...

5960
02:58:07,960 --> 02:58:08,420
Spare key.

5961
02:58:08,520 --> 02:58:08,820
Yeah.

5962
02:58:08,820 --> 02:58:09,360
What do I do?

5963
02:58:09,540 --> 02:58:10,200
Look at the...

5964
02:58:10,200 --> 02:58:12,200
Dude, how did this actually turn into a 3v1?

5965
02:58:12,220 --> 02:58:14,620
How did this actually turn into a 3v1?

5966
02:58:14,740 --> 02:58:15,900
So, you see where he is?

5967
02:58:15,940 --> 02:58:16,580
He's at the blue.

5968
02:58:16,620 --> 02:58:21,080
So, un-mortgage your light blue and then un-mortgage the pinks.

5969
02:58:23,100 --> 02:58:24,360
Oh, I see.

5970
02:58:24,360 --> 02:58:24,520
I see.

5971
02:58:25,980 --> 02:58:28,480
So, now he's trapped in this area.

5972
02:58:28,540 --> 02:58:29,280
Very good.

5973
02:58:29,420 --> 02:58:30,320
Now he's scared.

5974
02:58:30,840 --> 02:58:31,100
Yeah.

5975
02:58:31,180 --> 02:58:32,280
Now he's very scared.

5976
02:58:32,380 --> 02:58:33,960
And then remember the pinks as well, too.

5977
02:58:34,220 --> 02:58:34,600
Wait.

5978
02:58:34,600 --> 02:58:35,300
Why is that one so locked?

5979
02:58:37,720 --> 02:58:38,880
Because he owns that.

5980
02:58:38,940 --> 02:58:39,320
He owns that.

5981
02:58:39,320 --> 02:58:40,360
Oh, he owns that one.

5982
02:58:40,480 --> 02:58:40,720
Yeah.

5983
02:58:40,980 --> 02:58:41,380
Yeah.

5984
02:58:41,380 --> 02:58:43,140
The only other monopoly you have is like what?

5985
02:58:43,140 --> 02:58:43,500
Like yellow?

5986
02:58:44,420 --> 02:58:44,820
Oh.

5987
02:58:44,820 --> 02:58:45,000
Yeah.

5988
02:58:45,000 --> 02:58:46,620
Then un-mortgage all the pinks.

5989
02:58:46,980 --> 02:58:47,900
I don't have them.

5990
02:58:47,920 --> 02:58:48,480
I don't have them.

5991
02:58:48,500 --> 02:58:48,780
Oh, yeah.

5992
02:58:48,780 --> 02:58:51,100
It's really only worth going for the yellows at this point.

5993
02:58:51,120 --> 02:58:51,640
Not going to lie.

5994
02:58:52,320 --> 02:58:52,920
Is it?

5995
02:58:53,840 --> 02:58:54,340
Oh, wait.

5996
02:58:54,360 --> 02:58:54,880
I guess actually, yeah.

5997
02:58:54,900 --> 02:58:55,800
Honestly, you know what?

5998
02:58:55,860 --> 02:58:56,460
I should just get rid of them all.

5999
02:58:56,880 --> 02:58:59,340
Honestly, at this point, I'm just going to get them all.

6000
02:58:59,520 --> 02:59:00,680
You're just going to give him a death trap.

6001
02:59:00,840 --> 02:59:01,700
The reds are good.

6002
02:59:01,840 --> 02:59:02,460
The reds are good.

6003
02:59:03,980 --> 02:59:04,860
Get the reds.

6004
02:59:04,940 --> 02:59:05,880
Get some of these done.

6005
02:59:06,160 --> 02:59:06,780
Very good.

6006
02:59:08,200 --> 02:59:08,480
Wait.

6007
02:59:08,520 --> 02:59:09,240
Why am I building houses?

6008
02:59:09,760 --> 02:59:10,240
Why am I?

6009
02:59:10,240 --> 02:59:11,420
I'm not going to be building houses.

6010
02:59:12,780 --> 02:59:13,320
What do you mean?

6011
02:59:13,440 --> 02:59:13,780
What do you mean?

6012
02:59:13,940 --> 02:59:14,200
Wait.

6013
02:59:14,240 --> 02:59:14,620
I don't know.

6014
02:59:14,640 --> 02:59:15,860
And then you're safe.

6015
02:59:16,240 --> 02:59:16,640
All right.

6016
02:59:16,860 --> 02:59:17,580
Buy a house.

6017
02:59:17,680 --> 02:59:19,360
Dude, you could hotel on the blues.

6018
02:59:19,560 --> 02:59:20,780
Buy a house.

6019
02:59:22,060 --> 02:59:23,420
Dude, you could hotel the blues.

6020
02:59:23,420 --> 02:59:23,980
That'd be chicken.

6021
02:59:23,980 --> 02:59:24,440
Yes.

6022
02:59:24,440 --> 02:59:26,380
I mean, if I land on another blue, the game...

6023
02:59:26,380 --> 02:59:26,840
Dude, look at that.

6024
02:59:26,900 --> 02:59:27,520
Look at that.

6025
02:59:27,540 --> 02:59:28,680
Look how scary that is, Navi.

6026
02:59:30,220 --> 02:59:30,940
Oh, baby.

6027
02:59:33,020 --> 02:59:33,380
Okay.

6028
02:59:33,500 --> 02:59:34,520
Who does nine go?

6029
02:59:35,060 --> 02:59:35,420
Please.

6030
02:59:36,060 --> 02:59:38,300
Oh, he has to pay.

6031
02:59:38,480 --> 02:59:40,340
Oh, you own the property.

6032
02:59:40,780 --> 02:59:42,800
He was just lucky enough.

6033
02:59:44,340 --> 02:59:45,100
Oh, God.

6034
02:59:46,080 --> 02:59:48,360
Guys, we should spend it all because he's a danger zone.

6035
02:59:48,480 --> 02:59:48,820
Okay, here we go.

6036
02:59:48,880 --> 02:59:49,660
This is so over.

6037
02:59:49,880 --> 02:59:50,560
I wish you luck.

6038
02:59:50,600 --> 02:59:51,860
He's not even close to the oranges.

6039
02:59:51,860 --> 02:59:52,360
He has a death trap.

6040
02:59:53,180 --> 02:59:53,760
I said...

6041
02:59:53,760 --> 02:59:53,860
Wait.

6042
02:59:54,740 --> 02:59:55,440
Oh, I'm one plus.

6043
02:59:55,520 --> 02:59:56,120
I'm literally one plus.

6044
02:59:56,900 --> 02:59:57,220
Okay.

6045
02:59:57,560 --> 02:59:58,060
I think.

6046
02:59:58,320 --> 02:59:58,800
We'll pass.

6047
02:59:58,900 --> 02:59:59,920
You're on like a green or something, right?

6048
02:59:59,960 --> 03:00:00,380
Oh, shit.

6049
03:00:00,560 --> 03:00:01,340
Yeah, but he's mortgaged it.

6050
03:00:01,720 --> 03:00:02,040
Mortgage.

6051
03:00:02,040 --> 03:00:02,320
Okay.

6052
03:00:02,400 --> 03:00:02,620
Okay.

6053
03:00:02,620 --> 03:00:02,960
Very good.

6054
03:00:02,960 --> 03:00:03,220
Very good.

6055
03:00:03,280 --> 03:00:04,180
Like 10 bucks.

6056
03:00:04,380 --> 03:00:05,140
Very good.

6057
03:00:05,160 --> 03:00:05,460
Very good.

6058
03:00:05,480 --> 03:00:05,700
Very good.

6059
03:00:05,700 --> 03:00:05,940
Very good.

6060
03:00:05,940 --> 03:00:07,500
It's all just going to come down the rolls here.

6061
03:00:07,560 --> 03:00:08,440
If I land on another...

6062
03:00:08,440 --> 03:00:08,880
No way.

6063
03:00:08,900 --> 03:00:10,260
It's taking me closer to the blues.

6064
03:00:10,500 --> 03:00:10,820
Yeah.

6065
03:00:11,620 --> 03:00:12,920
Bring him to me.

6066
03:00:13,020 --> 03:00:14,120
More money, baby.

6067
03:00:14,340 --> 03:00:15,180
12 fuckers.

6068
03:00:15,700 --> 03:00:16,840
Like these don't matter.

6069
03:00:16,940 --> 03:00:18,280
It's just orange or blue at this point.

6070
03:00:18,280 --> 03:00:18,520
Oh, yeah.

6071
03:00:19,000 --> 03:00:20,100
It's orange or blue.

6072
03:00:20,300 --> 03:00:21,280
That's the death trap.

6073
03:00:21,420 --> 03:00:21,720
Yeah.

6074
03:00:21,720 --> 03:00:22,980
There's no other game here.

6075
03:00:23,120 --> 03:00:23,960
It's just orange or blue.

6076
03:00:24,380 --> 03:00:25,020
Oh, yeah.

6077
03:00:25,020 --> 03:00:26,480
Whoever landed orange or blue.

6078
03:00:27,180 --> 03:00:28,240
Home sweet home.

6079
03:00:28,240 --> 03:00:28,800
Oh, yeah.

6080
03:00:28,920 --> 03:00:29,500
You thought about it.

6081
03:00:29,740 --> 03:00:30,960
It's just orange or blue.

6082
03:00:30,980 --> 03:00:31,420
This is delightful.

6083
03:00:31,580 --> 03:00:31,720
That's it.

6084
03:00:31,720 --> 03:00:32,680
There's nothing else to it.

6085
03:00:32,920 --> 03:00:33,840
Come on now.

6086
03:00:35,580 --> 03:00:35,940
Wait.

6087
03:00:36,020 --> 03:00:36,400
I think it's...

6088
03:00:36,400 --> 03:00:36,720
Oh, no.

6089
03:00:36,780 --> 03:00:36,900
Wait.

6090
03:00:36,940 --> 03:00:37,760
I think I lose 100 bucks.

6091
03:00:37,940 --> 03:00:38,360
Don't I?

6092
03:00:38,840 --> 03:00:39,720
I don't think so.

6093
03:00:39,800 --> 03:00:40,120
No.

6094
03:00:40,400 --> 03:00:40,880
Oh, wait.

6095
03:00:40,880 --> 03:00:41,120
You do.

6096
03:00:41,460 --> 03:00:41,820
Oh, yeah.

6097
03:00:41,820 --> 03:00:41,840
You do.

6098
03:00:41,880 --> 03:00:42,240
Oh, shit.

6099
03:00:42,240 --> 03:00:42,440
Dude.

6100
03:00:42,460 --> 03:00:42,980
No way.

6101
03:00:42,980 --> 03:00:44,020
You're going to get it back.

6102
03:00:44,760 --> 03:00:47,540
I mean, at this point, it's genuinely just orange or blue.

6103
03:00:47,780 --> 03:00:49,520
It's just up to your guys' luck.

6104
03:00:49,520 --> 03:00:50,940
If it's orange, I have a chance to come back.

6105
03:00:51,040 --> 03:00:52,180
God damn it, man.

6106
03:00:52,520 --> 03:00:52,880
Dude.

6107
03:00:53,140 --> 03:00:54,260
How do I roll a double?

6108
03:00:54,500 --> 03:00:56,120
That little flag trolled me.

6109
03:00:56,420 --> 03:00:57,240
Here we go, brother.

6110
03:00:57,240 --> 03:00:58,460
That little flag trolled me, dude.

6111
03:00:59,660 --> 03:01:02,000
Sometimes $48 of gold broke out your hand.

6112
03:01:02,100 --> 03:01:02,980
Never give up.

6113
03:01:03,880 --> 03:01:04,260
Oh, man.

6114
03:01:04,840 --> 03:01:06,900
Hey, that's only 100 bucks more, man.

6115
03:01:06,920 --> 03:01:07,960
That's the money you owe me anyway.

6116
03:01:08,100 --> 03:01:08,380
You know?

6117
03:01:09,060 --> 03:01:09,460
There you go.

6118
03:01:09,640 --> 03:01:10,960
How do I roll another eight?

6119
03:01:11,040 --> 03:01:11,720
Another one.

6120
03:01:11,820 --> 03:01:12,040
Dude.

6121
03:01:12,180 --> 03:01:13,040
I think that lands me.

6122
03:01:13,040 --> 03:01:13,560
I think it's over.

6123
03:01:14,500 --> 03:01:15,200
Is it over?

6124
03:01:15,200 --> 03:01:15,480
I think it's over.

6125
03:01:15,660 --> 03:01:16,080
It is.

6126
03:01:16,140 --> 03:01:16,580
Oh, yeah.

6127
03:01:16,760 --> 03:01:17,260
Oh, wait.

6128
03:01:17,600 --> 03:01:18,380
It's over.

6129
03:01:18,760 --> 03:01:19,000
Dude.

6130
03:01:19,120 --> 03:01:19,420
I don't know.

6131
03:01:19,460 --> 03:01:19,480
I don't know.

6132
03:01:19,520 --> 03:01:20,140
I landed on it twice.

6133
03:01:20,460 --> 03:01:21,520
It's just bad luck.

6134
03:01:21,580 --> 03:01:23,540
It's just bad luck.

6135
03:01:23,660 --> 03:01:24,080
That's it.

6136
03:01:25,500 --> 03:01:25,900
Dude.

6137
03:01:26,120 --> 03:01:27,700
They didn't even have to 3v1.

6138
03:01:27,920 --> 03:01:28,960
I just landed on it twice.

6139
03:01:30,580 --> 03:01:31,160
Barnacle Bing.

6140
03:01:32,400 --> 03:01:33,120
Barnacle Bing.

6141
03:01:33,360 --> 03:01:33,560
Ellen, I told you.

6142
03:01:33,600 --> 03:01:36,900
The moment you have the dark boardwalk, you win, Ellen.

6143
03:01:37,020 --> 03:01:38,580
Dude, that really did win.

6144
03:01:38,780 --> 03:01:39,180
Jesus.

6145
03:01:39,180 --> 03:01:39,980
I told you.

6146
03:01:40,260 --> 03:01:41,260
Boardwalk wins games.

6147
03:01:41,260 --> 03:01:41,700
It's a W.

6148
03:01:41,960 --> 03:01:42,720
Do you guys want to do it?

6149
03:01:42,760 --> 03:01:43,340
Do you guys want to do one more?

6150
03:01:44,840 --> 03:01:45,560
No, I'm good.

6151
03:01:45,720 --> 03:01:46,200
She just...

6152
03:01:49,520 --> 03:01:49,920
She just said, nope.

6153
03:01:50,060 --> 03:01:51,400
That's my moral victory.

6154
03:01:51,800 --> 03:01:52,660
Oh, God.

6155
03:01:53,660 --> 03:01:54,140
Jesus.

6156
03:01:54,140 --> 03:01:54,840
That was intense.

6157
03:01:55,120 --> 03:01:55,460
That was intense.

6158
03:01:55,460 --> 03:01:57,760
Sykkuno losing to Ellen is my victory.

6159
03:01:58,260 --> 03:01:58,740
Oh.

6160
03:01:58,740 --> 03:02:00,780
I lost to three people, technically.

6161
03:02:00,980 --> 03:02:01,840
That is true.

6162
03:02:01,840 --> 03:02:02,880
What do you mean?

6163
03:02:03,160 --> 03:02:03,940
That is true.

6164
03:02:03,960 --> 03:02:06,740
Technically, I was supposed to get them all, but...

6165
03:02:07,420 --> 03:02:10,240
A win for Ellen is a win for all of us.

6166
03:02:10,300 --> 03:02:10,780
Exactly.

6167
03:02:11,280 --> 03:02:13,120
Do you guys want to play anything else?

6168
03:02:13,200 --> 03:02:15,080
Do you guys want to play any other games at all?

6169
03:02:15,100 --> 03:02:15,800
Play good games, guys.

6170
03:02:16,460 --> 03:02:17,760
I mean, I'm down for games.

6171
03:02:17,860 --> 03:02:18,080
Yeah.

6172
03:02:18,080 --> 03:02:18,940
I'm down for whatever.

6173
03:02:18,940 --> 03:02:22,500
I can play for another one hour, because I have a coaching thing at 5.

6174
03:02:22,500 --> 03:02:23,940
Do you want some Tricky Towers or something?

6175
03:02:24,280 --> 03:02:24,840
Yeah, I was.

6176
03:02:25,280 --> 03:02:25,780
Another hour?

6177
03:02:26,000 --> 03:02:26,840
Tricky Towers?

6178
03:02:27,060 --> 03:02:27,480
Tricky Towers?

6179
03:02:27,500 --> 03:02:28,600
Yeah, what is that?

6180
03:02:29,700 --> 03:02:31,360
Oh, we can do GeoGuessr or anything.

6181
03:02:31,880 --> 03:02:33,160
Honestly, I'm down for whatever.

6182
03:02:33,300 --> 03:02:33,900
Whatever you guys want to play.

6183
03:02:33,980 --> 03:02:35,240
I'm down for anything.

6184
03:02:36,640 --> 03:02:37,000
Same.

6185
03:02:37,540 --> 03:02:37,900
Same.

6186
03:02:38,080 --> 03:02:38,880
So, if you guys have any...

6187
03:02:39,800 --> 03:02:40,280
Deciding games.

6188
03:02:41,380 --> 03:02:42,160
Yeah, me too.

6189
03:02:42,720 --> 03:02:44,060
I'm like, what do you play?

6190
03:02:44,680 --> 03:02:47,320
I mean, literally anything.

6191
03:02:47,580 --> 03:02:48,780
You know, GeoGuessr.

6192
03:02:48,780 --> 03:02:49,980
Tricky Towers.

6193
03:02:50,000 --> 03:02:50,740
Fool Guys.

6194
03:02:51,140 --> 03:02:51,420
We can play Risk.

6195
03:02:51,620 --> 03:02:52,020
Risk.

6196
03:02:52,080 --> 03:02:53,360
We do Risk as Risk.

6197
03:02:53,500 --> 03:02:55,440
Risk is going to go to another strategy game.

6198
03:02:55,440 --> 03:02:57,560
Oh god, the Risk is going to be...

6199
03:02:57,560 --> 03:02:59,260
Wait, do you want to do Risk?

6200
03:02:59,580 --> 03:03:00,440
You actually want to do that?

6201
03:03:02,020 --> 03:03:02,800
I'd be down.

6202
03:03:02,860 --> 03:03:04,080
I actually would be down for Risk.

6203
03:03:04,280 --> 03:03:06,480
I feel like Risk is a really long game.

6204
03:03:06,620 --> 03:03:07,920
Or it can be really long.

6205
03:03:08,040 --> 03:03:09,620
Not the way me and Syke play it.

6206
03:03:09,660 --> 03:03:11,940
Me and Syke just int each other the whole time.

6207
03:03:14,440 --> 03:03:16,820
Um, otherwise, there's...

6208
03:03:16,820 --> 03:03:17,380
Watch out.

6209
03:03:17,440 --> 03:03:18,040
Game of Life.

6210
03:03:18,180 --> 03:03:18,760
Game of Life is going to be...

6211
03:03:18,760 --> 03:03:18,860
It's going to be fun.

6212
03:03:21,800 --> 03:03:25,100
Um, uh, honestly, I'd be down for Risk.

6213
03:03:25,360 --> 03:03:25,960
I'd be down.

6214
03:03:28,440 --> 03:03:28,840
Risk.

6215
03:03:28,840 --> 03:03:31,740
You could do that or Roblox.

6216
03:03:31,820 --> 03:03:32,660
Once again, I'm on more risk.

6217
03:03:34,300 --> 03:03:35,640
Anita, thank you for the raid!

6218
03:03:36,520 --> 03:03:36,720
Yeah!

6219
03:03:37,100 --> 03:03:38,520
Wait, Alan hasn't finished...

6220
03:03:38,520 --> 03:03:39,840
Dude, we could do Doors.

6221
03:03:40,000 --> 03:03:41,220
I'm honestly down for one of them.

6222
03:03:41,480 --> 03:03:42,620
I'll be back in one second though.

6223
03:03:42,800 --> 03:03:44,040
Anita, thank you for the raid!

6224
03:03:44,080 --> 03:03:45,480
Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello!

6225
03:03:46,680 --> 03:03:47,080
Doors.

6226
03:03:47,260 --> 03:03:47,440
Yeah.

6227
03:03:48,120 --> 03:03:50,260
The only thing is that I can't set up the lobby because I don't know how to.

6228
03:03:50,360 --> 03:03:51,460
But I'm definitely down for Doors.

6229
03:03:51,460 --> 03:03:51,760
I'm down.

6230
03:03:51,900 --> 03:03:52,580
I'm definitely down.

6231
03:03:52,760 --> 03:03:53,540
Dude, can we do...

6232
03:03:53,540 --> 03:03:54,860
Can we do Roblox Party as well?

6233
03:03:54,860 --> 03:03:56,400
Can we do Doors and Roblox Party?

6234
03:03:56,460 --> 03:03:56,980
Because I actually loved it.

6235
03:03:57,000 --> 03:03:58,380
We can do Roblox Party.

6236
03:03:58,640 --> 03:03:58,920
Yes!

6237
03:03:58,920 --> 03:03:59,560
Okay, that's actually fine.

6238
03:03:59,620 --> 03:03:59,900
Let's do that.

6239
03:03:59,960 --> 03:04:00,900
Wait, what's Roblox Party?

6240
03:04:01,100 --> 03:04:01,840
Dude, it's so fucking good, dude.

6241
03:04:03,200 --> 03:04:04,300
Um, Anita, thank you for the raid!

6242
03:04:04,340 --> 03:04:04,740
Hello, everybody.

6243
03:04:04,840 --> 03:04:05,240
Welcome in.

6244
03:04:05,240 --> 03:04:06,540
If you guys don't know me, I'm Joshua Elam.

6245
03:04:07,440 --> 03:04:08,900
Um, Anita, I want to play games.

6246
03:04:09,780 --> 03:04:13,260
I feel like also we stream like around the same time now because I'm always on like a PSD schedule.

6247
03:04:13,740 --> 03:04:15,140
I want to play games.

6248
03:04:15,380 --> 03:04:16,080
I miss you.

6249
03:04:16,800 --> 03:04:17,440
I miss you.

6250
03:04:17,820 --> 03:04:20,820
Um, but anyone from my stream, obviously, I'm sure you guys all know exactly who Anita is.

6251
03:04:20,860 --> 03:04:22,120
If you don't, please make sure you guys go and drop a follow.

6252
03:04:22,340 --> 03:04:22,920
She's awesome.

6253
03:04:23,060 --> 03:04:23,660
I love Anita.

6254
03:04:24,280 --> 03:04:26,060
Also, I hope you're going to TwitchCon because I'm going to be there.

6255
03:04:26,160 --> 03:04:26,600
That's going to be awesome.

6256
03:04:27,880 --> 03:04:28,720
Um, how do I know...

6257
03:04:28,720 --> 03:04:29,100
Blah, blah, blah.

6258
03:04:29,300 --> 03:04:29,760
Sorry, chat.

6259
03:04:29,800 --> 03:04:30,360
I'm like...

6260
03:04:30,360 --> 03:04:31,340
So guys, you just arrived.

6261
03:04:31,420 --> 03:04:32,100
We just finished Monopoly.

6262
03:04:32,260 --> 03:04:34,080
We're currently playing with Hewn, Sykkuno, and Doki.

6263
03:04:34,480 --> 03:04:35,080
It's really good.

6264
03:04:35,140 --> 03:04:35,560
It's awesome.

6265
03:04:36,060 --> 03:04:37,200
So, um, yeah, man.

6266
03:04:37,500 --> 03:04:37,960
It's great.

6267
03:04:38,120 --> 03:04:38,780
And now we're gonna...

6268
03:04:38,780 --> 03:04:39,360
I'm down.

6269
03:04:39,380 --> 03:04:39,680
We'll have to chat.

6270
03:04:39,680 --> 03:04:40,560
Yeah, dude, let's do it.

6271
03:04:40,560 --> 03:04:40,980
Let's do it.

6272
03:04:40,980 --> 03:04:41,960
And I'll see you at TwitchCon as well.

6273
03:04:42,100 --> 03:04:42,740
It's going to be awesome.

6274
03:04:42,880 --> 03:04:43,680
It's going to be awesome.

6275
03:04:44,140 --> 03:04:44,700
Not really.

6276
03:04:44,920 --> 03:04:46,400
Currently, I've just been, like, vibing.

6277
03:04:46,800 --> 03:04:48,400
Um, so wait, you said we were doing Roblox, right?

6278
03:04:49,160 --> 03:04:49,640
Yeah, we're doing...

6279
03:04:49,640 --> 03:04:50,040
Yeah, yeah.

6280
03:04:50,460 --> 03:04:50,820
Roblox Party.

6281
03:04:52,460 --> 03:04:53,020
I'm DonkSass5000.

6282
03:04:53,660 --> 03:04:55,440
Wait, are we doing Roblox Party or are we doing Duels first?

6283
03:04:56,400 --> 03:04:58,500
I mean, whatever you guys want to do.

6284
03:04:58,600 --> 03:04:59,040
I don't...

6285
03:04:59,040 --> 03:05:01,420
I never played Roblox Party before, so I don't...

6286
03:05:01,420 --> 03:05:01,860
Dude, it's...

6287
03:05:01,860 --> 03:05:02,280
My idea.

6288
03:05:02,840 --> 03:05:04,160
We're gonna play Roblox.

6289
03:05:04,160 --> 03:05:05,580
Dude, yeah, we're gonna do it, bro.

6290
03:05:05,580 --> 03:05:09,520
Well, you said you only had an hour, so I didn't want to do something too time consuming.

6291
03:05:09,520 --> 03:05:11,200
I have a coaching session for Modern Zangief.

6292
03:05:11,300 --> 03:05:13,660
No, honestly, actually, I'm so down.

6293
03:05:13,740 --> 03:05:14,540
Who are you getting coached...

6294
03:05:14,540 --> 03:05:15,600
Who are you getting coached by?

6295
03:05:16,420 --> 03:05:18,160
I pulled in a ringer.

6296
03:05:18,400 --> 03:05:21,720
Not my usual coach, but I pulled in a ringer for Modern Zangief.

6297
03:05:22,320 --> 03:05:22,680
Justin?

6298
03:05:22,680 --> 03:05:23,180
No, no, no.

6299
03:05:23,260 --> 03:05:23,420
Bro.

6300
03:05:23,480 --> 03:05:24,380
This guy, uh...

6301
03:05:24,380 --> 03:05:25,040
Oh, my God.

6302
03:05:25,200 --> 03:05:26,280
I heard he's an EVO champion.

6303
03:05:26,300 --> 03:05:26,760
Bye, Anita.

6304
03:05:27,140 --> 03:05:27,940
I get things done for the ring.

6305
03:05:27,940 --> 03:05:28,960
I really appreciate it.

6306
03:05:29,140 --> 03:05:29,180
Oh, my God.

6307
03:05:29,860 --> 03:05:31,680
Dude, playing champ on the background, so...

6308
03:05:31,680 --> 03:05:35,180
But, dude, honestly, guys, so I decided to listen to Chaperone when I was in LA.

6309
03:05:35,640 --> 03:05:36,940
I've been in LA for the last, like, six months.

6310
03:05:36,980 --> 03:05:37,420
Six months or so?

6311
03:05:37,760 --> 03:05:39,020
I'm back in the UK now for a little bit.

6312
03:05:39,060 --> 03:05:40,720
I'm going back out for TwitchCon again.

6313
03:05:42,220 --> 03:05:46,800
Dude, so I listened to Chaperone when I was there, and I have been, like, straight up, like, legitimately addicted.

6314
03:05:47,280 --> 03:05:48,960
Like, dude, holy crap.

6315
03:05:49,020 --> 03:05:51,080
They are so freaking talented.

6316
03:05:51,220 --> 03:05:56,720
Like, dude, the whole album or, like, sorry, the whole, like, all of the songs so far, which I've listened to, have been fucking incredible, dude.

6317
03:05:57,220 --> 03:06:01,860
Modern Zangief has given me something so much, but honestly, they've been, like, actually straight up incredible as hell.

6318
03:06:02,640 --> 03:06:03,320
It's been so...

6319
03:06:03,320 --> 03:06:04,740
Dude, Chaperone goes crazy.

6320
03:06:04,820 --> 03:06:05,500
Goes actually crazy.

6321
03:06:05,520 --> 03:06:05,560
You idiot!

6322
03:06:06,360 --> 03:06:08,840
Um, Sebastian, thank you for the three dollars as well, man.

6323
03:06:08,880 --> 03:06:09,360
I appreciate the love, dude.

6324
03:06:09,420 --> 03:06:09,940
Thank you so much.

6325
03:06:10,580 --> 03:06:12,180
Um, yeah, actually fire, bro.

6326
03:06:12,420 --> 03:06:13,300
Actually fire as hell.

6327
03:06:13,400 --> 03:06:13,980
Actually fire as hell.

6328
03:06:14,880 --> 03:06:15,680
Wait, what's your...

6329
03:06:15,680 --> 03:06:17,260
What's your Roblox name?

6330
03:06:17,360 --> 03:06:19,160
Oh, wait, he has it in his title already?

6331
03:06:19,440 --> 03:06:21,280
Well, dude, I was gonna try and surprise people.

6332
03:06:21,420 --> 03:06:21,720
There you go.

6333
03:06:22,280 --> 03:06:22,920
I think...

6334
03:06:22,920 --> 03:06:23,760
I think you guys can join us.

6335
03:06:24,480 --> 03:06:24,800
Roblox!

6336
03:06:25,240 --> 03:06:26,880
Dude, I am so hyped for Roblox party.

6337
03:06:26,940 --> 03:06:29,380
I actually, weirdly, really enjoyed this last time.

6338
03:06:30,620 --> 03:06:31,420
Oh, wait, can I join?

6339
03:06:31,560 --> 03:06:33,240
It's a lot more faster paced.

6340
03:06:33,300 --> 03:06:34,440
How do I join you on this again?

6341
03:06:35,380 --> 03:06:37,600
You just click... click my link and then...

6342
03:06:37,600 --> 03:06:38,100
I'll click the link in general.

6343
03:06:38,180 --> 03:06:41,920
...and then you come over to the quad section and then you'll probably see my model.

6344
03:06:43,080 --> 03:06:44,040
Oh, I press play.

6345
03:06:44,220 --> 03:06:45,280
Oh, I press play and then I go...

6346
03:06:45,280 --> 03:06:45,640
Okay, okay.

6347
03:06:45,760 --> 03:06:46,060
Yeah, yeah.

6348
03:06:47,300 --> 03:06:47,740
Ohhhh.

6349
03:06:48,720 --> 03:06:49,860
Alright, I'm in.

6350
03:06:50,540 --> 03:06:51,740
I got daily awards.

6351
03:06:52,340 --> 03:06:52,820
Let's go.

6352
03:06:53,360 --> 03:06:54,900
Do you see me?

6353
03:06:55,040 --> 03:06:57,260
Are you Thomas the Tank Engine?

6354
03:06:57,280 --> 03:06:58,480
Yeah, I'm Thomas the Tank Engine.

6355
03:06:59,440 --> 03:07:01,840
Dude, why would you...

6356
03:07:01,840 --> 03:07:02,100
Why?

6357
03:07:02,200 --> 03:07:03,380
Is that lore behind this?

6358
03:07:03,400 --> 03:07:04,000
No, why?

6359
03:07:04,000 --> 03:07:04,400
What?

6360
03:07:04,860 --> 03:07:06,160
Dude, I thought Thomas the Tank Engine was...

6361
03:07:06,160 --> 03:07:06,880
Who doesn't want to be a...

6362
03:07:06,880 --> 03:07:07,680
I like trains.

6363
03:07:07,700 --> 03:07:08,540
Dude, I'm being so real.

6364
03:07:08,600 --> 03:07:10,380
I thought Thomas the Tank Engine was a British thing.

6365
03:07:10,480 --> 03:07:11,100
I'm just gonna say it.

6366
03:07:11,180 --> 03:07:12,000
I thought it was a British thing.

6367
03:07:13,580 --> 03:07:13,860
Is it?

6368
03:07:13,860 --> 03:07:14,180
Apparently not though.

6369
03:07:14,940 --> 03:07:15,220
Is it?

6370
03:07:15,220 --> 03:07:15,520
It's not?

6371
03:07:15,740 --> 03:07:17,220
You guys know Thomas the Tank Engine?

6372
03:07:18,260 --> 03:07:19,340
Yeah, is he not British?

6373
03:07:20,240 --> 03:07:21,780
Don't they talk in a British accent?

6374
03:07:23,820 --> 03:07:24,420
Is it not?

6375
03:07:24,500 --> 03:07:25,780
I swear, it's worldwide?

6376
03:07:27,300 --> 03:07:28,500
Dude, am I bugging out?

6377
03:07:28,700 --> 03:07:30,360
I swear, I thought it was like a British show.

6378
03:07:30,440 --> 03:07:31,900
I thought no one in America knew about it.

6379
03:07:32,060 --> 03:07:33,100
Okay, well, hey, there we go.

6380
03:07:33,180 --> 03:07:33,740
Now, now...

6381
03:07:33,740 --> 03:07:35,600
Wait, you thought no one knew about Thomas the Tank Engine?

6382
03:07:35,600 --> 03:07:35,940
No, dude.

6383
03:07:36,000 --> 03:07:36,860
Oh, so that's what you meant?

6384
03:07:37,080 --> 03:07:38,340
Oh, I thought you meant like...

6385
03:07:38,340 --> 03:07:39,600
Wait, you and I are in your game.

6386
03:07:39,740 --> 03:07:40,520
Oh yeah, I see you.

6387
03:07:40,600 --> 03:07:41,220
Yes, yes, yes.

6388
03:07:41,240 --> 03:07:42,300
Yeah, you're here, you're here.

6389
03:07:43,120 --> 03:07:44,320
I see Doki as well.

6390
03:07:44,320 --> 03:07:44,760
I just don't...

6391
03:07:44,760 --> 03:07:45,860
Maybe I should change my skin.

6392
03:07:46,320 --> 03:07:48,040
You guys think I should change my skin?

6393
03:07:48,040 --> 03:07:48,520
It is...

6394
03:07:48,520 --> 03:07:50,280
I like the Iron Mouse skin.

6395
03:07:50,580 --> 03:07:52,980
Do you have the Iron Mouse one, too?

6396
03:07:53,020 --> 03:07:54,920
I got it when we were playing with Mouse.

6397
03:07:54,980 --> 03:07:56,780
It's like kind of like a meme, you know what I mean?

6398
03:07:57,000 --> 03:07:57,360
Yeah.

6399
03:07:57,380 --> 03:07:59,140
Wait, you're Thomas the Tank Engine?

6400
03:07:59,840 --> 03:08:00,880
What is that?

6401
03:08:00,940 --> 03:08:01,520
I like trains.

6402
03:08:02,260 --> 03:08:02,780
Dude, it's crazy.

6403
03:08:02,900 --> 03:08:03,680
Dude, I should be...

6404
03:08:04,200 --> 03:08:09,380
It's crazy when you were saying I chose it as a meme and then Doki said you sat there looking like Thomas the fucking Tank Engine.

6405
03:08:11,500 --> 03:08:15,960
It's because I saw somebody with a car skin and I was like, oh my god, wait, did that exist?

6406
03:08:16,160 --> 03:08:17,400
Yeah, some of the skins are crazy.

6407
03:08:17,620 --> 03:08:19,140
Yeah, so I was like, I'm gonna be Thomas.

6408
03:08:19,580 --> 03:08:20,660
Wait, wait, where are you, Doki?

6409
03:08:20,920 --> 03:08:21,580
Oh, I'm here.

6410
03:08:21,740 --> 03:08:22,020
I'm here.

6411
03:08:22,560 --> 03:08:23,780
I'm literally the train.

6412
03:08:24,820 --> 03:08:25,180
Wait, what?

6413
03:08:25,340 --> 03:08:26,720
I don't see the train, dude.

6414
03:08:26,760 --> 03:08:27,780
Where the fuck is the train?

6415
03:08:29,060 --> 03:08:30,860
We're in the middle, we're in the middle.

6416
03:08:31,000 --> 03:08:31,780
I'm in the middle.

6417
03:08:32,540 --> 03:08:33,500
Wait, are you...

6418
03:08:33,500 --> 03:08:34,600
Did you click my link?

6419
03:08:34,680 --> 03:08:35,160
Are you in here?

6420
03:08:35,160 --> 03:08:36,400
I did, but it didn't put me into anything.

6421
03:08:37,780 --> 03:08:38,060
What?

6422
03:08:38,580 --> 03:08:39,520
It didn't put me into anything.

6423
03:08:40,440 --> 03:08:42,220
Am I friends with you on Roblox?

6424
03:08:42,520 --> 03:08:42,800
Oh.

6425
03:08:45,200 --> 03:08:46,360
We don't need to be friends.

6426
03:08:46,380 --> 03:08:47,460
You can just click the link.

6427
03:08:47,740 --> 03:08:48,700
Oh, wait, I think I'm joining, I think I'm joining.

6428
03:08:48,780 --> 03:08:49,200
I think I'm joining.

6429
03:08:49,240 --> 03:08:49,900
I think I pressed the wrong one.

6430
03:08:50,820 --> 03:08:51,100
Yeah.

6431
03:08:51,120 --> 03:08:51,760
Oh, yeah, there you go.

6432
03:08:52,220 --> 03:08:53,160
Yeah, yeah, that's him.

6433
03:08:53,240 --> 03:08:53,560
That's him.

6434
03:08:54,820 --> 03:08:55,640
Yo, what's good?

6435
03:08:57,800 --> 03:08:58,080
Yo.

6436
03:09:00,160 --> 03:09:01,120
It's time, guys.

6437
03:09:01,360 --> 03:09:01,840
Dude, you're...

6438
03:09:01,840 --> 03:09:02,400
All right.

6439
03:09:02,520 --> 03:09:02,880
Let's go.

6440
03:09:02,880 --> 03:09:05,320
Hugh's hands and feet just made me die, bro.

6441
03:09:05,980 --> 03:09:07,600
Look at the size of those things.

6442
03:09:07,840 --> 03:09:09,420
Let's try a different map than last time, you think?

6443
03:09:09,660 --> 03:09:10,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6444
03:09:10,220 --> 03:09:10,360
Huh?

6445
03:09:11,260 --> 03:09:12,180
Let's do it, let's do it, let's do it.

6446
03:09:12,660 --> 03:09:13,480
Which map, what?

6447
03:09:13,540 --> 03:09:14,020
Which map?

6448
03:09:14,380 --> 03:09:15,680
Never played this one before.

6449
03:09:15,860 --> 03:09:16,480
Just like, I don't...

6450
03:09:16,480 --> 03:09:18,400
Oh, Salzburg looks nice.

6451
03:09:18,400 --> 03:09:19,160
Let's do that, let's do that.

6452
03:09:19,240 --> 03:09:20,420
It's like a little Christmas looking town.

6453
03:09:20,440 --> 03:09:20,720
All right.

6454
03:09:20,800 --> 03:09:21,600
Oh, yeah, it looks good.

6455
03:09:21,600 --> 03:09:21,800
Let's go.

6456
03:09:21,840 --> 03:09:22,600
Let's do it, guys.

6457
03:09:24,540 --> 03:09:27,160
Dude, honestly, guys, Roblox Party actually goes crazy.

6458
03:09:27,400 --> 03:09:28,680
It actually goes crazy, dude.

6459
03:09:29,340 --> 03:09:29,960
It's such a...

6460
03:09:29,960 --> 03:09:32,680
It's such a coked-ass game, but it's so much fun.

6461
03:09:32,680 --> 03:09:33,000
It's fun, bro.

6462
03:09:33,060 --> 03:09:34,060
It's so good.

6463
03:09:34,660 --> 03:09:35,600
Yeah, it's like a really...

6464
03:09:35,600 --> 03:09:37,220
Like, genuinely, I don't know how to describe it.

6465
03:09:37,520 --> 03:09:40,340
But it's actually good, though, in like a weird way, plus...

6466
03:09:40,340 --> 03:09:45,460
I mean, it's good because it's entertaining, but it's not good because it's fair, balanced, or makes any sense, so...

6467
03:09:45,460 --> 03:09:51,440
No, okay, by the way, by the way, also, Doki, if you want to, and I'm going to say this, if you want to choose the mini-games, it's pay to win.

6468
03:09:51,500 --> 03:09:54,240
You can literally choose the levels we do it by paying real money.

6469
03:09:54,340 --> 03:09:56,060
Yeah, if you pay real-life money, you can choose the mini-games.

6470
03:09:56,280 --> 03:09:56,600
Yeah.

6471
03:09:57,120 --> 03:09:58,000
What the fuck?

6472
03:09:58,140 --> 03:09:59,420
I got a 1, dude?

6473
03:09:59,760 --> 03:10:00,960
Wow, this game doesn't want me to win.

6474
03:10:00,960 --> 03:10:02,260
Dude, I spent 20 bucks.

6475
03:10:02,260 --> 03:10:02,800
I did it.

6476
03:10:02,820 --> 03:10:04,640
I did, like, chose every level.

6477
03:10:04,760 --> 03:10:05,240
Oh my god, a 1!

6478
03:10:05,560 --> 03:10:06,440
You got a 1?

6479
03:10:06,440 --> 03:10:07,220
I got a 1?

6480
03:10:07,500 --> 03:10:07,600
You got this first!

6481
03:10:07,720 --> 03:10:08,100
Let's go!

6482
03:10:08,420 --> 03:10:08,980
Dude, wow.

6483
03:10:09,280 --> 03:10:09,720
Nice.

6484
03:10:09,720 --> 03:10:10,580
Very good.

6485
03:10:10,600 --> 03:10:11,480
Let's make it go.

6486
03:10:11,700 --> 03:10:12,700
Very, very good.

6487
03:10:14,020 --> 03:10:15,500
Oh, so you get the crown, right?

6488
03:10:16,100 --> 03:10:16,540
Yeah.

6489
03:10:16,660 --> 03:10:18,780
It's 15 to get the crown.

6490
03:10:19,200 --> 03:10:20,380
What the fuck is this?

6491
03:10:20,460 --> 03:10:21,360
Custom dice.

6492
03:10:21,840 --> 03:10:24,220
Oh my god, this is Mario Party, but like...

6493
03:10:24,220 --> 03:10:24,920
Dude, you're a tank.

6494
03:10:25,020 --> 03:10:27,600
Thomas the Tank Engine is fucking fried, bro.

6495
03:10:28,320 --> 03:10:30,960
This is Mario Party, but poor.

6496
03:10:31,220 --> 03:10:31,640
No, it is.

6497
03:10:31,720 --> 03:10:32,160
Wow.

6498
03:10:32,200 --> 03:10:32,240
Wow.

6499
03:10:32,240 --> 03:10:32,720
It actually is.

6500
03:10:33,540 --> 03:10:33,900
Dude.

6501
03:10:34,060 --> 03:10:34,880
It's a Big Ten.

6502
03:10:35,140 --> 03:10:38,300
Doki, so they basically steal most of the mini-games, either Mario Party or Fool Guys.

6503
03:10:38,420 --> 03:10:39,840
Like, there's literally Hexagon in this game.

6504
03:10:40,040 --> 03:10:41,880
Like, Hexagon is a literal game in this.

6505
03:10:42,040 --> 03:10:43,180
But it's actually good, though.

6506
03:10:43,300 --> 03:10:44,360
It's actually fire.

6507
03:10:44,620 --> 03:10:46,820
Yeah, because you don't have to give Nintendo money.

6508
03:10:47,000 --> 03:10:48,400
You can play it fast.

6509
03:10:49,640 --> 03:10:50,360
Oh, Fawzi!

6510
03:10:51,180 --> 03:10:51,540
Wait.

6511
03:10:52,400 --> 03:10:54,680
The crown's to the right if you go in no directions.

6512
03:10:54,760 --> 03:10:55,480
Go, go.

6513
03:10:55,540 --> 03:10:57,120
Shut the fuck up.

6514
03:10:58,560 --> 03:10:59,500
Oh, free item.

6515
03:10:59,680 --> 03:11:00,260
Come on.

6516
03:11:00,560 --> 03:11:01,080
Crown won!

6517
03:11:01,160 --> 03:11:01,960
Crown won!

6518
03:11:01,960 --> 03:11:02,700
Wow.

6519
03:11:03,380 --> 03:11:03,880
What?

6520
03:11:04,020 --> 03:11:05,140
Let's go, bro.

6521
03:11:05,460 --> 03:11:07,120
He just got a golden crown.

6522
03:11:07,240 --> 03:11:08,420
He just got a golden crown.

6523
03:11:08,880 --> 03:11:11,240
That doesn't make any sense.

6524
03:11:11,500 --> 03:11:14,160
Guys, can you buy crowns with real money?

6525
03:11:14,540 --> 03:11:15,120
Dude, imagine.

6526
03:11:15,200 --> 03:11:15,540
Imagine.

6527
03:11:15,960 --> 03:11:17,440
It's literally pay to win.

6528
03:11:17,540 --> 03:11:19,180
Like, quite literally at that point, pay to win.

6529
03:11:20,480 --> 03:11:22,120
Look at the shop real quick.

6530
03:11:22,220 --> 03:11:24,360
Yeah, let me just have a quick browse real fast.

6531
03:11:25,520 --> 03:11:26,800
Holy crap, dude.

6532
03:11:26,880 --> 03:11:28,260
Mini-games are worth a lot, too.

6533
03:11:29,380 --> 03:11:30,820
Oh, my God, dude.

6534
03:11:31,080 --> 03:11:31,640
All right.

6535
03:11:32,140 --> 03:11:33,480
What are these mini-games?

6536
03:11:33,700 --> 03:11:34,780
As long as it's not Red Light Green Light.

6537
03:11:34,920 --> 03:11:36,020
Dude, Red Light Green Light's good.

6538
03:11:36,360 --> 03:11:38,680
Is this like Squid Game?

6539
03:11:38,880 --> 03:11:40,160
Is it like that Red Light Green Light?

6540
03:11:40,200 --> 03:11:40,880
I assume it is.

6541
03:11:40,940 --> 03:11:42,160
Yeah, I'd have to assume it is.

6542
03:11:42,180 --> 03:11:43,240
Yeah, it has to be, right?

6543
03:11:44,320 --> 03:11:45,080
Wait, what do I do?

6544
03:11:45,400 --> 03:11:46,580
Guys, guys, there's green.

6545
03:11:47,620 --> 03:11:48,380
Is that red?

6546
03:11:48,420 --> 03:11:49,000
Where are you guys going?

6547
03:11:49,200 --> 03:11:49,840
Wait, that was orange.

6548
03:11:50,780 --> 03:11:51,140
Wait.

6549
03:11:51,600 --> 03:11:52,520
Which way am I going?

6550
03:11:53,120 --> 03:11:54,480
What are you doing?

6551
03:11:55,000 --> 03:11:55,560
I'm dead.

6552
03:11:56,500 --> 03:11:57,760
How did you guys die?

6553
03:11:58,180 --> 03:12:00,460
Because I got stopped on the red.

6554
03:12:02,580 --> 03:12:03,060
This door.

6555
03:12:08,440 --> 03:12:09,240
I died.

6556
03:12:10,280 --> 03:12:12,400
Wait, white zones aren't safe, bro?

6557
03:12:12,600 --> 03:12:13,740
Dude, of course they're not safe.

6558
03:12:13,860 --> 03:12:14,880
Dude, I thought white zone meant safe.

6559
03:12:15,020 --> 03:12:15,800
No, you idiot.

6560
03:12:16,040 --> 03:12:16,640
What do you mean?

6561
03:12:17,220 --> 03:12:17,620
No.

6562
03:12:17,660 --> 03:12:18,140
I don't know.

6563
03:12:18,380 --> 03:12:20,440
I'm so fucking stupid, bro.

6564
03:12:20,620 --> 03:12:20,920
What?

6565
03:12:20,920 --> 03:12:21,740
Don't get terrifying.

6566
03:12:22,420 --> 03:12:24,580
Okay, I thought white zone meant safe.

6567
03:12:24,700 --> 03:12:26,660
I barely, I barely made it off the start line.

6568
03:12:26,780 --> 03:12:28,540
I literally barely made off the start line.

6569
03:12:28,620 --> 03:12:29,520
That is so embarrassing.

6570
03:12:29,520 --> 03:12:29,540
Yeah.

6571
03:12:29,640 --> 03:12:31,180
I got free rewards.

6572
03:12:31,640 --> 03:12:33,380
I thought white zone meant safe.

6573
03:12:33,480 --> 03:12:34,720
I don't know why they put those in the game.

6574
03:12:34,760 --> 03:12:35,960
Oh my goodness bro.

6575
03:12:36,040 --> 03:12:36,840
I'll get the gems.

6576
03:12:37,040 --> 03:12:38,180
I don't know what they're for but I'll get the gems.

6577
03:12:38,180 --> 03:12:39,520
That is crazy bro.

6578
03:12:41,860 --> 03:12:43,080
Alright, roll time.

6579
03:12:43,500 --> 03:12:45,780
It doesn't matter because like he has a crown.

6580
03:12:46,080 --> 03:12:48,780
Hey Dokie, could you sing the Thomas the Tank Engine theme song?

6581
03:12:50,260 --> 03:12:51,820
I don't even remember.

6582
03:12:52,080 --> 03:12:52,960
It's been years.

6583
03:12:53,320 --> 03:12:56,200
How do you remember the Thomas the Tank Engine song?

6584
03:12:56,260 --> 03:12:56,820
I don't.

6585
03:12:57,140 --> 03:12:57,580
I don't.

6586
03:12:57,580 --> 03:12:58,320
I don't.

6587
03:12:58,320 --> 03:13:03,000
The only child show I remember is Bananas in Pyjamas.

6588
03:13:03,260 --> 03:13:04,140
Does anyone remember that?

6589
03:13:04,200 --> 03:13:04,740
Bananas in Pyjamas?

6590
03:13:04,960 --> 03:13:07,200
What the fuck is... is that the...

6591
03:13:07,200 --> 03:13:09,200
The Bananas in Pyjamas.

6592
03:13:09,340 --> 03:13:10,680
Is that the one where they're in the blue pyjamas?

6593
03:13:10,800 --> 03:13:11,420
Yes dude.

6594
03:13:11,780 --> 03:13:12,740
Bananas in Pyjamas.

6595
03:13:12,900 --> 03:13:16,280
Yeah, they're like two banana twins and they're in blue pyjamas.

6596
03:13:16,320 --> 03:13:19,680
Yeah, Bananas in Pyjamas are coming down the stairs.

6597
03:13:20,000 --> 03:13:20,660
You guys...

6598
03:13:22,420 --> 03:13:22,980
Um...

6599
03:13:23,600 --> 03:13:24,160
Guys...

6600
03:13:24,920 --> 03:13:25,960
I don't know that one.

6601
03:13:26,140 --> 03:13:26,700
Oh...

6602
03:13:26,700 --> 03:13:28,880
How much money do I need to buy a crown again?

6603
03:13:29,000 --> 03:13:29,420
It's 20, right?

6604
03:13:30,400 --> 03:13:31,660
I think it's 15 actually.

6605
03:13:32,080 --> 03:13:32,660
A two?

6606
03:13:33,040 --> 03:13:33,580
Oh, hey man.

6607
03:13:34,020 --> 03:13:34,620
Oh, nice.

6608
03:13:35,500 --> 03:13:38,360
Like, can you look at how much gold you have?

6609
03:13:38,600 --> 03:13:39,180
Big roll.

6610
03:13:39,560 --> 03:13:39,960
Six.

6611
03:13:40,480 --> 03:13:40,880
Great.

6612
03:13:41,120 --> 03:13:41,520
Great.

6613
03:13:41,800 --> 03:13:42,460
Very good.

6614
03:13:42,560 --> 03:13:42,780
Very good.

6615
03:13:42,780 --> 03:13:44,100
I don't think he has enough, guys.

6616
03:13:44,140 --> 03:13:45,480
So you're calling me a broke boy is what you're saying?

6617
03:13:46,480 --> 03:13:46,880
Yes.

6618
03:13:47,120 --> 03:13:49,420
No, I stole your coins earlier.

6619
03:13:49,840 --> 03:13:50,500
You did?

6620
03:13:51,000 --> 03:13:51,400
Yeah.

6621
03:13:52,960 --> 03:13:54,620
Why would you do that to me?

6622
03:13:55,200 --> 03:13:56,760
Because you have a crown warp.

6623
03:13:57,120 --> 03:13:57,700
What is that?

6624
03:13:58,620 --> 03:13:59,780
It's taller than I tell you.

6625
03:13:59,840 --> 03:14:01,140
The player closest to the crown.

6626
03:14:02,280 --> 03:14:03,020
Minigame time.

6627
03:14:03,880 --> 03:14:06,900
Please give me... give me like a missile mayhem.

6628
03:14:06,940 --> 03:14:07,520
That sounds fun.

6629
03:14:09,460 --> 03:14:11,180
Oh, what's World Wonderland?

6630
03:14:11,420 --> 03:14:11,700
Yes.

6631
03:14:11,820 --> 03:14:12,260
Yes.

6632
03:14:12,380 --> 03:14:12,920
Oh, okay.

6633
03:14:13,140 --> 03:14:15,380
Yo, I ask and I shall receive.

6634
03:14:15,680 --> 03:14:18,360
Dude, he's playing off stream or something.

6635
03:14:18,540 --> 03:14:19,820
How does he know these games?

6636
03:14:20,100 --> 03:14:21,220
What did it say?

6637
03:14:21,480 --> 03:14:22,880
Stream sniping.

6638
03:14:23,040 --> 03:14:24,600
Wait, this is so slow.

6639
03:14:24,600 --> 03:14:26,400
Like, who's going to die to that?

6640
03:14:26,640 --> 03:14:27,280
Okay, how do you know?

6641
03:14:27,560 --> 03:14:28,360
Thank you, Michael.

6642
03:14:28,580 --> 03:14:30,320
How do you know this game?

6643
03:14:30,560 --> 03:14:34,240
Because we said this last time that me and Huynh both died, okay?

6644
03:14:34,340 --> 03:14:34,900
So let's just...

6645
03:14:34,900 --> 03:14:36,660
Okay, well, actually...

6646
03:14:37,640 --> 03:14:40,200
Yeah, I don't know why you jumped on top of my block.

6647
03:14:40,440 --> 03:14:41,920
What do you... you're blaming it on me?

6648
03:14:42,400 --> 03:14:43,960
You're blaming it on me?

6649
03:14:44,080 --> 03:14:44,560
That's crazy.

6650
03:14:45,960 --> 03:14:46,640
No, I didn't...

6651
03:14:46,640 --> 03:14:47,260
Wait, how did I die?

6652
03:14:47,540 --> 03:14:48,740
Wait, why did he die?

6653
03:14:48,740 --> 03:14:49,340
He died.

6654
03:14:49,940 --> 03:14:50,740
You died?

6655
03:14:51,440 --> 03:14:52,380
Oh, my God.

6656
03:14:53,200 --> 03:14:53,860
Wait, dude.

6657
03:14:53,860 --> 03:14:54,320
It's getting kind of...

6658
03:14:54,320 --> 03:14:54,840
Holy, wait.

6659
03:14:54,900 --> 03:14:55,480
It's getting kind of...

6660
03:14:55,480 --> 03:14:55,680
What the fuck?

6661
03:14:56,180 --> 03:14:57,180
It's getting kind of quick.

6662
03:14:57,380 --> 03:14:58,560
What is the hitbox?

6663
03:14:58,620 --> 03:15:01,000
Okay, I now know what the hitbox is like.

6664
03:15:01,080 --> 03:15:01,280
I thought...

6665
03:15:01,280 --> 03:15:02,220
Dude, it's getting kind of fast.

6666
03:15:02,300 --> 03:15:03,520
It's going for Huynh.

6667
03:15:03,540 --> 03:15:04,180
Yeah, get her.

6668
03:15:04,200 --> 03:15:04,520
Get her.

6669
03:15:04,580 --> 03:15:05,060
Yeah, yeah.

6670
03:15:05,180 --> 03:15:05,980
Zone in on her.

6671
03:15:06,060 --> 03:15:07,260
What the fuck is that?

6672
03:15:07,300 --> 03:15:07,760
I don't know.

6673
03:15:07,760 --> 03:15:10,240
My feet might be big, but they're not big enough to get in.

6674
03:15:10,240 --> 03:15:11,700
The hitbox is so crazy.

6675
03:15:11,700 --> 03:15:12,240
Bro, it has...

6676
03:15:12,240 --> 03:15:13,740
Why does it have a splash zone?

6677
03:15:13,780 --> 03:15:16,920
What in the name of box-ass games is this, bro?

6678
03:15:17,020 --> 03:15:17,680
That's how I got this show, dude.

6679
03:15:17,680 --> 03:15:18,560
What the fuck?

6680
03:15:19,380 --> 03:15:19,780
Okay.

6681
03:15:19,920 --> 03:15:20,440
The splash zone.

6682
03:15:20,440 --> 03:15:21,860
Why is there a splash zone?

6683
03:15:25,220 --> 03:15:26,380
Yeah, that's fucked.

6684
03:15:26,600 --> 03:15:26,800
Three.

6685
03:15:27,580 --> 03:15:28,840
All right, here I go.

6686
03:15:30,120 --> 03:15:30,920
Very good.

6687
03:15:31,560 --> 03:15:32,100
Oh, I got a crown warp as well.

6688
03:15:32,100 --> 03:15:33,520
You got a crown warp as well.

6689
03:15:33,820 --> 03:15:35,220
Ain't no way, brothers.

6690
03:15:35,580 --> 03:15:35,820
That's insane.

6691
03:15:36,120 --> 03:15:36,960
Oh my god.

6692
03:15:37,120 --> 03:15:37,960
Wait, where did Huynh go?

6693
03:15:38,040 --> 03:15:38,760
She didn't go for the crown?

6694
03:15:38,800 --> 03:15:40,220
Yeah, you didn't go for the crown, Huynh.

6695
03:15:40,320 --> 03:15:40,440
How?

6696
03:15:40,440 --> 03:15:42,640
Because I rolled on...

6697
03:15:42,640 --> 03:15:46,320
I rolled just enough to get the crown, and then...

6698
03:15:46,320 --> 03:15:47,460
Oh, didn't have the money yet?

6699
03:15:47,500 --> 03:15:48,540
I didn't have the money, yeah.

6700
03:15:49,000 --> 03:15:49,060
Oh.

6701
03:15:49,140 --> 03:15:50,440
Was it 20 or 15?

6702
03:15:51,080 --> 03:15:51,480
It's 15.

6703
03:15:52,080 --> 03:15:52,840
It's 15.

6704
03:15:52,880 --> 03:15:53,140
Please don't...

6705
03:15:53,140 --> 03:15:53,840
And I had, like, 11.

6706
03:15:53,860 --> 03:15:54,760
I don't want to land on it.

6707
03:15:54,760 --> 03:15:55,380
I don't want to land on it.

6708
03:15:55,500 --> 03:15:56,120
Oh, thank god.

6709
03:15:56,620 --> 03:15:57,160
Oh, thank god.

6710
03:15:57,280 --> 03:15:57,420
All right.

6711
03:15:57,460 --> 03:15:57,560
Wait.

6712
03:15:58,460 --> 03:15:59,180
Onwards, onwards, onwards.

6713
03:15:59,560 --> 03:16:00,340
The cyclone could add on it.

6714
03:16:00,440 --> 03:16:00,680
Yeah.

6715
03:16:01,380 --> 03:16:02,060
Give me my coins.

6716
03:16:02,120 --> 03:16:02,480
Give me my coins.

6717
03:16:04,060 --> 03:16:04,460
All right.

6718
03:16:04,500 --> 03:16:05,180
You're the closest.

6719
03:16:05,400 --> 03:16:06,040
Wait, I have an item.

6720
03:16:06,760 --> 03:16:07,520
Dude, I don't need that.

6721
03:16:07,560 --> 03:16:08,240
I'm going to roll a 10.

6722
03:16:08,660 --> 03:16:09,580
Do you think you're going to roll a 10?

6723
03:16:09,740 --> 03:16:10,760
I will bet my...

6724
03:16:12,300 --> 03:16:12,780
Huge roll.

6725
03:16:12,780 --> 03:16:13,320
Wait, what did he get?

6726
03:16:13,360 --> 03:16:13,700
What did he get?

6727
03:16:13,720 --> 03:16:14,160
What did he get?

6728
03:16:14,200 --> 03:16:14,860
Rolled a 10 right there.

6729
03:16:15,460 --> 03:16:16,340
He's one away?

6730
03:16:16,700 --> 03:16:17,340
He's literally just there.

6731
03:16:17,900 --> 03:16:18,140
Yeah.

6732
03:16:18,480 --> 03:16:19,060
Oh, man.

6733
03:16:20,280 --> 03:16:21,740
I'm going to steal this crown from him, by the way.

6734
03:16:21,740 --> 03:16:25,180
This is like Mario Party where you have to land, get the exact number, right?

6735
03:16:25,260 --> 03:16:26,180
Give me a sensor spin.

6736
03:16:26,300 --> 03:16:26,860
A sensor spin.

6737
03:16:27,680 --> 03:16:28,040
Oh.

6738
03:16:28,920 --> 03:16:29,280
Spiral.

6739
03:16:29,980 --> 03:16:30,340
Spiral.

6740
03:16:30,520 --> 03:16:30,880
No.

6741
03:16:30,880 --> 03:16:31,020
Spiral.

6742
03:16:31,200 --> 03:16:31,560
Spiral.

6743
03:16:31,840 --> 03:16:32,700
No, man.

6744
03:16:33,940 --> 03:16:34,300
Christ.

6745
03:16:34,900 --> 03:16:35,880
I don't want to subscribe.

6746
03:16:36,400 --> 03:16:37,060
Dude, what is this one?

6747
03:16:37,140 --> 03:16:37,740
How do you play?

6748
03:16:37,740 --> 03:16:38,120
Wait, how do you...

6749
03:16:38,120 --> 03:16:38,780
Oh, oh.

6750
03:16:38,780 --> 03:16:40,720
I think you're supposed to...

6751
03:16:40,720 --> 03:16:41,820
Let me go in this corner.

6752
03:16:41,940 --> 03:16:42,200
It looks...

6753
03:16:42,200 --> 03:16:42,460
Oh, no.

6754
03:16:42,500 --> 03:16:44,500
You have to keep track of this platform.

6755
03:16:45,680 --> 03:16:48,020
And then you're supposed to run to it after it's done spinning.

6756
03:16:48,140 --> 03:16:49,460
Oh, okay.

6757
03:16:49,660 --> 03:16:50,020
What?

6758
03:16:50,120 --> 03:16:51,180
Dude, I'm going to...

6759
03:16:51,740 --> 03:16:52,180
Oh, my.

6760
03:16:52,520 --> 03:16:52,940
Oh, okay.

6761
03:16:53,200 --> 03:16:54,320
Dude, it's obviously this...

6762
03:16:54,320 --> 03:16:55,040
It's obviously this...

6763
03:16:55,040 --> 03:16:57,180
Dude, I think cycles are going to go there.

6764
03:16:57,320 --> 03:16:57,480
Guys, what the fuck, guys?

6765
03:16:57,480 --> 03:16:58,880
Cycles are going to go there, by the way.

6766
03:16:59,020 --> 03:16:59,740
Guys, what the fuck, guys?

6767
03:17:00,520 --> 03:17:01,460
You guys just followed where I went.

6768
03:17:01,460 --> 03:17:02,680
Does anyone mess this up?

6769
03:17:02,680 --> 03:17:04,460
It doesn't even seem possible to mess up.

6770
03:17:04,460 --> 03:17:05,260
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

6771
03:17:05,400 --> 03:17:05,880
This is silly.

6772
03:17:06,120 --> 03:17:07,120
No, no, no, no.

6773
03:17:07,120 --> 03:17:08,360
This is super simple.

6774
03:17:08,520 --> 03:17:10,920
You literally just walked where I walked, dude.

6775
03:17:10,920 --> 03:17:11,580
Dude, my eyes.

6776
03:17:11,740 --> 03:17:12,120
My eyes.

6777
03:17:12,280 --> 03:17:12,520
What?

6778
03:17:12,540 --> 03:17:14,080
It rubber banded.

6779
03:17:14,140 --> 03:17:15,160
It rubber banded.

6780
03:17:15,900 --> 03:17:16,860
Is it this one?

6781
03:17:17,700 --> 03:17:18,500
Is it this?

6782
03:17:18,580 --> 03:17:20,180
Dude, it literally rubber banded.

6783
03:17:20,820 --> 03:17:21,480
That is crazy.

6784
03:17:21,480 --> 03:17:21,720
That is crazy.

6785
03:17:22,980 --> 03:17:24,840
This game is actually unloosable.

6786
03:17:25,840 --> 03:17:29,680
Dude, someone will have to jab me in the eyeball for me to lose this game.

6787
03:17:29,760 --> 03:17:30,780
Like, it's not even possible.

6788
03:17:31,040 --> 03:17:31,960
Dude, my thing is...

6789
03:17:31,960 --> 03:17:32,960
It's not even that fast.

6790
03:17:33,660 --> 03:17:34,600
Oh, wait a minute.

6791
03:17:35,160 --> 03:17:36,320
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

6792
03:17:36,320 --> 03:17:37,220
Just wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

6793
03:17:37,280 --> 03:17:37,720
This one?

6794
03:17:37,980 --> 03:17:38,600
This is one of his.

6795
03:17:38,760 --> 03:17:39,840
It's not that.

6796
03:17:40,000 --> 03:17:40,380
No, wait.

6797
03:17:40,760 --> 03:17:41,080
What?

6798
03:17:43,200 --> 03:17:45,660
I almost got Sykkuno to die, though.

6799
03:17:45,740 --> 03:17:46,220
Oh, dude.

6800
03:17:46,280 --> 03:17:47,720
Dude, Doki tried to bait me.

6801
03:17:47,800 --> 03:17:49,120
Elem didn't even choose one.

6802
03:17:49,340 --> 03:17:49,660
Bro.

6803
03:17:50,680 --> 03:17:51,700
Dude, Elem didn't even choose one.

6804
03:17:51,700 --> 03:17:51,900
What is it?

6805
03:17:51,900 --> 03:17:53,780
There was literally a countdown.

6806
03:17:54,260 --> 03:17:56,900
Why is it brother, brother?

6807
03:17:57,440 --> 03:17:57,740
That's funny.

6808
03:17:58,120 --> 03:17:59,920
Everyone is one except for Elem.

6809
03:18:00,160 --> 03:18:03,960
I almost baited Sykkuno to die.

6810
03:18:03,960 --> 03:18:04,440
That's crazy, bro!

6811
03:18:04,620 --> 03:18:05,140
That was close.

6812
03:18:05,400 --> 03:18:05,980
That was close.

6813
03:18:06,420 --> 03:18:07,300
That's funny.

6814
03:18:07,300 --> 03:18:08,880
Okay, as long as Doki rolls low here...

6815
03:18:08,880 --> 03:18:09,640
Oh my god.

6816
03:18:09,680 --> 03:18:10,220
Fuck you.

6817
03:18:13,800 --> 03:18:14,920
Holy crap.

6818
03:18:15,580 --> 03:18:16,580
Okay, okay.

6819
03:18:17,260 --> 03:18:20,060
There is no way, bro.

6820
03:18:20,640 --> 03:18:21,680
I get the first card.

6821
03:18:21,700 --> 03:18:22,100
I got the first crown.

6822
03:18:22,120 --> 03:18:23,220
I got the first crown here.

6823
03:18:23,880 --> 03:18:25,400
Wait, is he right in front of it?

6824
03:18:25,420 --> 03:18:25,580
No!

6825
03:18:26,080 --> 03:18:27,280
Yeah, he's literally right in front of it.

6826
03:18:27,360 --> 03:18:29,320
If you roll higher than a seven, you get it.

6827
03:18:29,400 --> 03:18:30,640
Real shame, Psychuno.

6828
03:18:30,880 --> 03:18:32,780
You just rolled a seven, you psychopath.

6829
03:18:33,180 --> 03:18:34,800
Real shame, Psychuno.

6830
03:18:36,320 --> 03:18:38,220
I'm doing this just to piss you off.

6831
03:18:38,240 --> 03:18:38,780
You could've just rolled a seven.

6832
03:18:38,780 --> 03:18:40,400
I'm doing this just to piss you off.

6833
03:18:41,100 --> 03:18:42,040
Give me my coin.

6834
03:18:42,560 --> 03:18:43,380
Give me my crown.

6835
03:18:43,440 --> 03:18:43,820
Yes.

6836
03:18:44,340 --> 03:18:44,740
Yes.

6837
03:18:45,120 --> 03:18:45,520
Yes.

6838
03:18:46,000 --> 03:18:46,620
That's mine.

6839
03:18:47,160 --> 03:18:47,760
That's mine.

6840
03:18:47,900 --> 03:18:48,300
That's insane.

6841
03:18:48,500 --> 03:18:49,060
That's insane.

6842
03:18:49,060 --> 03:18:50,100
Are we facing different?

6843
03:18:50,300 --> 03:18:51,180
We're going head-on.

6844
03:18:51,300 --> 03:18:52,860
Wait, how are we going head-on?

6845
03:18:52,960 --> 03:18:53,760
That makes no sense at all.

6846
03:18:53,860 --> 03:18:54,400
Wait a second.

6847
03:18:54,660 --> 03:18:56,460
Wait, how can you go that direction?

6848
03:18:56,460 --> 03:18:57,020
Where am I going?

6849
03:18:57,420 --> 03:18:58,340
Why have I gone in reverse?

6850
03:18:58,880 --> 03:18:59,240
Wait.

6851
03:18:59,960 --> 03:19:01,140
Dude, you're going in reverse.

6852
03:19:01,300 --> 03:19:02,400
Why am I going in reverse?

6853
03:19:02,980 --> 03:19:04,140
Dude, this game's broken.

6854
03:19:04,820 --> 03:19:07,300
Dude, this game's actually broken.

6855
03:19:07,380 --> 03:19:07,700
What?

6856
03:19:07,920 --> 03:19:09,000
Why am I going in reverse?

6857
03:19:09,780 --> 03:19:11,360
Dude, if he gets another golden coin...

6858
03:19:11,360 --> 03:19:11,840
Yo, value coins!

6859
03:19:12,920 --> 03:19:14,980
Receive a coin for every space you reach.

6860
03:19:15,080 --> 03:19:16,180
That's psychotic.

6861
03:19:16,440 --> 03:19:18,100
Who balanced this game, dude?

6862
03:19:19,060 --> 03:19:19,860
I'm going in reverse as well.

6863
03:19:20,440 --> 03:19:22,820
This is dope as fuck, bro.

6864
03:19:23,260 --> 03:19:25,840
You got warp tips to go in reverse.

6865
03:19:27,200 --> 03:19:27,720
Warped.

6866
03:19:27,720 --> 03:19:28,080
Bop.

6867
03:19:28,460 --> 03:19:31,640
Now, I'm further away from the star.

6868
03:19:31,800 --> 03:19:32,400
Just a little.

6869
03:19:35,400 --> 03:19:36,440
Very good.

6870
03:19:39,160 --> 03:19:40,380
Keep going, brother.

6871
03:19:40,540 --> 03:19:40,900
Keep going.

6872
03:19:41,100 --> 03:19:41,340
Where is it?

6873
03:19:41,540 --> 03:19:42,900
Where is it anyway?

6874
03:19:42,980 --> 03:19:43,560
Don't you do it.

6875
03:19:43,560 --> 03:19:44,340
No, you dick!

6876
03:19:44,640 --> 03:19:45,080
Oh my god.

6877
03:19:45,520 --> 03:19:48,980
There's no way you actually reached that.

6878
03:19:49,060 --> 03:19:50,260
There's actually no way.

6879
03:19:50,420 --> 03:19:50,920
I don't know how that makes any sense.

6880
03:19:51,100 --> 03:19:51,920
It doesn't seem...

6881
03:19:51,920 --> 03:19:54,820
There ain't no way you genuinely reached that, bro.

6882
03:19:54,980 --> 03:19:55,080
It doesn't seem right.

6883
03:19:56,260 --> 03:19:57,200
No, because it's not.

6884
03:19:57,420 --> 03:19:59,900
It's a load of BX, bro.

6885
03:19:59,980 --> 03:20:00,980
That's what I'm saying it is.

6886
03:20:01,020 --> 03:20:02,160
The crown's over there.

6887
03:20:02,260 --> 03:20:03,440
I'm not upset about it.

6888
03:20:03,480 --> 03:20:03,780
I'm just confused.

6889
03:20:03,940 --> 03:20:04,380
I am!

6890
03:20:08,040 --> 03:20:09,400
Someone's a little salty there.

6891
03:20:10,220 --> 03:20:11,880
I don't really know what happened.

6892
03:20:11,960 --> 03:20:13,480
Give me a blow the fuse.

6893
03:20:13,560 --> 03:20:14,460
Blow the fuse is so much fun.

6894
03:20:14,500 --> 03:20:14,940
Blow the fuse.

6895
03:20:15,060 --> 03:20:15,280
Come on.

6896
03:20:15,280 --> 03:20:16,640
Blow the fuse.

6897
03:20:16,960 --> 03:20:19,220
What the fuck is stove survival?

6898
03:20:20,540 --> 03:20:21,600
What the fuck is stove survival?

6899
03:20:21,680 --> 03:20:22,460
What do you do for this one?

6900
03:20:22,600 --> 03:20:25,340
I'm just confused as to how I am going backwards now.

6901
03:20:26,540 --> 03:20:26,980
I'm just confused as to how I am going backwards now.

6902
03:20:27,400 --> 03:20:28,560
Wait, what are we doing?

6903
03:20:29,120 --> 03:20:31,900
Dude, how do you die in this one?

6904
03:20:32,140 --> 03:20:33,800
Surely there's literally no way you die.

6905
03:20:34,300 --> 03:20:37,360
I'm assuming it'll get harder, but as of right now...

6906
03:20:37,360 --> 03:20:38,840
I mean, it's for kids, man.

6907
03:20:39,260 --> 03:20:41,120
Guys, guys, guys.

6908
03:20:42,380 --> 03:20:43,520
We'll be fine, right?

6909
03:20:43,820 --> 03:20:44,560
Surely, right?

6910
03:20:45,280 --> 03:20:46,540
Yeah, we'll be fine.

6911
03:20:46,660 --> 03:20:47,540
Help me.

6912
03:20:48,120 --> 03:20:48,640
What?

6913
03:20:49,220 --> 03:20:49,900
What?

6914
03:20:53,000 --> 03:20:53,600
Dude, dude.

6915
03:20:54,040 --> 03:20:56,400
That was every single one.

6916
03:20:57,240 --> 03:20:59,120
How did Alan win?

6917
03:20:59,880 --> 03:21:01,120
Dude, I jumped.

6918
03:21:01,120 --> 03:21:01,700
Dude, I jumped.

6919
03:21:02,240 --> 03:21:04,980
He jumped at the last second, but still died.

6920
03:21:04,980 --> 03:21:06,740
Every single one turned red.

6921
03:21:06,800 --> 03:21:08,220
That doesn't even make sense.

6922
03:21:08,520 --> 03:21:10,720
That is actually bullshit.

6923
03:21:11,020 --> 03:21:11,900
Oh my god.

6924
03:21:11,900 --> 03:21:13,180
Oh my god.

6925
03:21:13,460 --> 03:21:14,900
Yeah, that was a thing.

6926
03:21:15,580 --> 03:21:19,240
Yeah, that happens.

6927
03:21:19,920 --> 03:21:22,480
That is fucking wild, bro.

6928
03:21:23,840 --> 03:21:25,700
Both sides go to the crown.

6929
03:21:25,840 --> 03:21:26,900
What's that money block?

6930
03:21:28,920 --> 03:21:29,800
I'll go this way.

6931
03:21:29,940 --> 03:21:31,240
Holy shit, that was funny.

6932
03:21:31,440 --> 03:21:33,820
Dude, I can't believe I jumped at the exact right time.

6933
03:21:33,820 --> 03:21:34,420
That's insane.

6934
03:21:35,660 --> 03:21:37,560
Dude, that is insane.

6935
03:21:37,940 --> 03:21:38,780
No, I don't have enough.

6936
03:21:38,780 --> 03:21:39,760
Holy crap.

6937
03:21:39,940 --> 03:21:40,620
Oh, it does.

6938
03:21:40,720 --> 03:21:41,840
You can buy it reverse.

6939
03:21:42,780 --> 03:21:44,040
Wait, you can buy it?

6940
03:21:44,040 --> 03:21:45,760
Oh, so you can pay to go back yourself?

6941
03:21:46,460 --> 03:21:47,660
Yeah, you can pay.

6942
03:21:47,800 --> 03:21:49,880
Oh, so the crown will...

6943
03:21:49,880 --> 03:21:50,360
Oh, okay.

6944
03:21:52,360 --> 03:21:52,900
That's a win.

6945
03:21:55,420 --> 03:21:56,220
Oh, return.

6946
03:21:56,520 --> 03:21:56,900
Oh, there we go.

6947
03:21:58,460 --> 03:22:00,280
Wait, there's a shop in this?

6948
03:22:00,560 --> 03:22:02,640
I don't think anyone's ever reached the shop before.

6949
03:22:03,400 --> 03:22:06,280
Yeah, the biggest thing is spending that much money is crazy.

6950
03:22:06,280 --> 03:22:07,220
What the frick?

6951
03:22:07,320 --> 03:22:08,860
Yeah, because you might as well just buy a crown.

6952
03:22:09,060 --> 03:22:09,260
Yeah.

6953
03:22:12,160 --> 03:22:13,020
Oh, that's huge.

6954
03:22:14,060 --> 03:22:14,740
Where's the other wall?

6955
03:22:14,860 --> 03:22:15,580
I don't know if that's close.

6956
03:22:16,740 --> 03:22:18,240
Oh, she's right next to it.

6957
03:22:18,280 --> 03:22:19,480
Wait, she's right in front of it.

6958
03:22:19,540 --> 03:22:20,100
No way.

6959
03:22:21,660 --> 03:22:22,860
Use my bag of coins.

6960
03:22:24,220 --> 03:22:25,280
For what reason?

6961
03:22:25,720 --> 03:22:27,860
The higher you roll now, the more coins you get.

6962
03:22:27,960 --> 03:22:28,400
I need money.

6963
03:22:29,300 --> 03:22:30,220
Ten coins, baby.

6964
03:22:31,880 --> 03:22:35,060
Wait, if you go to the right, you go on the teleporter.

6965
03:22:36,280 --> 03:22:36,660
You could be close.

6966
03:22:36,780 --> 03:22:38,660
Come on, come on, come on.

6967
03:22:38,760 --> 03:22:39,760
Huge gameplay.

6968
03:22:40,080 --> 03:22:40,760
Now you're right.

6969
03:22:41,040 --> 03:22:42,520
Where are you?

6970
03:22:42,860 --> 03:22:46,280
Never mind, guys.

6971
03:22:46,600 --> 03:22:47,460
That's unfortunate.

6972
03:22:49,540 --> 03:22:50,800
Oh, yeah, random bonus.

6973
03:22:51,400 --> 03:22:53,320
Make a rival lose five coins, please.

6974
03:22:53,840 --> 03:22:54,920
No, no!

6975
03:22:55,300 --> 03:22:58,100
If he chooses me, I'm gonna lose my mind.

6976
03:22:58,260 --> 03:22:59,380
It's doki, it's doki, it's doki.

6977
03:23:01,300 --> 03:23:02,220
It's just random.

6978
03:23:03,700 --> 03:23:05,040
Okay, here we go.

6979
03:23:06,280 --> 03:23:06,620
It was not random.

6980
03:23:07,100 --> 03:23:07,800
It was random.

6981
03:23:08,160 --> 03:23:09,000
It was 100% random.

6982
03:23:09,080 --> 03:23:10,860
Give me a boost to dodge.

6983
03:23:11,020 --> 03:23:12,020
Boost to dodge.

6984
03:23:12,100 --> 03:23:15,940
I like stove survival.

6985
03:23:16,040 --> 03:23:16,400
It was good.

6986
03:23:16,540 --> 03:23:17,100
It was a good time.

6987
03:23:17,300 --> 03:23:18,100
For everyone involved.

6988
03:23:18,600 --> 03:23:20,780
What do we do in this game?

6989
03:23:20,900 --> 03:23:22,240
I'm assuming you don't touch the blue.

6990
03:23:22,620 --> 03:23:23,780
Wait, what does that mean?

6991
03:23:24,080 --> 03:23:25,240
You collect the shells.

6992
03:23:27,620 --> 03:23:29,160
How do we get up?

6993
03:23:29,680 --> 03:23:31,320
I'm assuming you don't touch the blue.

6994
03:23:34,560 --> 03:23:35,000
Okay.

6995
03:23:36,440 --> 03:23:36,880
Wait.

6996
03:23:37,240 --> 03:23:38,660
This is chalks, bro.

6997
03:23:40,060 --> 03:23:41,020
Do you like...

6998
03:23:41,020 --> 03:23:44,240
Do you like lose if you don't...

6999
03:23:45,740 --> 03:23:46,220
Do you like lose if you don't...

7000
03:23:46,220 --> 03:23:47,600
If you die in the water?

7001
03:23:47,800 --> 03:23:48,320
No, no, no.

7002
03:23:48,380 --> 03:23:50,600
You get sent back.

7003
03:23:50,740 --> 03:23:52,960
I think you're just trying to collect as many shells as possible.

7004
03:23:52,960 --> 03:23:54,180
It just resets you, basically.

7005
03:23:54,180 --> 03:23:56,340
So there's no penalty for touching the water?

7006
03:23:56,900 --> 03:23:57,820
There's literally none.

7007
03:23:57,820 --> 03:23:59,380
You just gotta like...

7008
03:23:59,380 --> 03:23:59,900
Dude...

7009
03:24:00,500 --> 03:24:02,520
I have like zero shells, though.

7010
03:24:03,040 --> 03:24:04,560
No, there is a penalty.

7011
03:24:05,920 --> 03:24:07,340
There is a penalty.

7012
03:24:07,460 --> 03:24:07,780
There is?

7013
03:24:08,200 --> 03:24:09,340
Yeah, there is!

7014
03:24:09,400 --> 03:24:12,400
Why do you all have zero?

7015
03:24:12,400 --> 03:24:15,560
I see Sykuna with 13 shells.

7016
03:24:15,560 --> 03:24:16,640
You're like zero there.

7017
03:24:17,360 --> 03:24:19,240
Sykuna never touched the water.

7018
03:24:19,680 --> 03:24:21,480
How many do I have?

7019
03:24:22,080 --> 03:24:23,100
I've got zero.

7020
03:24:23,100 --> 03:24:24,440
I've invaded all of you.

7021
03:24:24,600 --> 03:24:25,700
I've got zero.

7022
03:24:28,620 --> 03:24:32,020
Sykuna invaded all of you guys and himself.

7023
03:24:32,300 --> 03:24:33,100
There's no way.

7024
03:24:33,100 --> 03:24:35,140
You lose all of them when you die, I guess.

7025
03:24:35,460 --> 03:24:37,900
There's actually no way I get zero, though.

7026
03:24:37,940 --> 03:24:40,020
There's actually no way I get zero.

7027
03:24:40,200 --> 03:24:40,920
You actually invaded yourself.

7028
03:24:41,940 --> 03:24:45,120
It's because you kept dying saying, no, there's no penalty for touching the water.

7029
03:24:45,160 --> 03:24:47,080
There is actually no way.

7030
03:24:47,940 --> 03:24:50,240
There is no shot, dude.

7031
03:24:50,400 --> 03:24:52,040
That's actually fucking hilarious.

7032
03:24:52,260 --> 03:24:53,200
Oh my god, bro.

7033
03:24:53,200 --> 03:24:55,440
The fact that he was actually ignorant.

7034
03:24:55,820 --> 03:24:58,760
The worst thing to do is I actually thought, I thought I was cooking that as well.

7035
03:24:58,900 --> 03:25:00,100
I thought I was absolutely cooking.

7036
03:25:00,700 --> 03:25:01,600
That's right in front of me.

7037
03:25:02,280 --> 03:25:04,060
That might be right behind me.

7038
03:25:04,520 --> 03:25:05,400
That's right behind you.

7039
03:25:07,220 --> 03:25:08,920
You gotta get another one.

7040
03:25:09,500 --> 03:25:10,380
Give me something big.

7041
03:25:10,700 --> 03:25:11,440
A four.

7042
03:25:11,700 --> 03:25:14,720
You got three coins, though.

7043
03:25:14,760 --> 03:25:15,900
That does nothing for me.

7044
03:25:16,680 --> 03:25:19,040
Dude, it's right behind me.

7045
03:25:19,080 --> 03:25:20,000
I can't believe it.

7046
03:25:20,400 --> 03:25:21,700
You gotta buy the reverse.

7047
03:25:22,840 --> 03:25:24,260
Would you like to view the shop?

7048
03:25:24,260 --> 03:25:25,300
How much money I got here?

7049
03:25:25,660 --> 03:25:27,220
You have enough to buy the reversal.

7050
03:25:27,560 --> 03:25:28,760
Dude, golden block.

7051
03:25:29,360 --> 03:25:29,880
Wait a minute.

7052
03:25:30,260 --> 03:25:32,340
If I buy the reverse, though.

7053
03:25:33,940 --> 03:25:35,600
No, I'm about to go eight, though.

7054
03:25:35,740 --> 03:25:37,400
I think I just go golden block here.

7055
03:25:37,620 --> 03:25:39,080
I'm about to move eight forward.

7056
03:25:40,660 --> 03:25:41,920
So I'd have to reverse eight.

7057
03:25:42,320 --> 03:25:43,700
Hit him with the reversal, bro.

7058
03:25:43,800 --> 03:25:44,460
You can still do it.

7059
03:25:45,720 --> 03:25:46,840
Yeah, you can still do it.

7060
03:25:46,840 --> 03:25:47,360
You're still there.

7061
03:25:47,580 --> 03:25:48,480
I still believe, you know.

7062
03:25:48,680 --> 03:25:49,440
Why can't I click this?

7063
03:25:50,500 --> 03:25:51,660
Why can't I click this?

7064
03:25:52,760 --> 03:25:53,920
Welcome to Roblox.

7065
03:25:53,980 --> 03:25:55,480
Looks like you're teleporting now, bro.

7066
03:25:55,580 --> 03:25:56,760
Looks like you're teleporting.

7067
03:25:56,980 --> 03:25:59,060
Very good.

7068
03:25:59,480 --> 03:26:00,440
Very, very good.

7069
03:26:01,480 --> 03:26:02,400
Oh, no.

7070
03:26:02,520 --> 03:26:03,420
Mini-game time.

7071
03:26:05,080 --> 03:26:06,160
Okay, could've been worse.

7072
03:26:06,340 --> 03:26:07,700
Dude, that was Taco Tuesday.

7073
03:26:09,360 --> 03:26:10,320
Kinda hope we get it.

7074
03:26:10,320 --> 03:26:11,800
Oh, dang.

7075
03:26:11,920 --> 03:26:12,280
Nice.

7076
03:26:12,320 --> 03:26:13,500
Dude, it looks like Play-Doh.

7077
03:26:14,640 --> 03:26:15,580
Yeah, it kinda does.

7078
03:26:16,060 --> 03:26:18,400
Wait, it is like Play-Doh.

7079
03:26:19,440 --> 03:26:21,100
Why is there, like, no instructions?

7080
03:26:21,980 --> 03:26:22,420
Like...

7081
03:26:23,540 --> 03:26:24,260
Dude, what?

7082
03:26:24,520 --> 03:26:27,120
Oh, you gotta, like, make the tacos.

7083
03:26:29,300 --> 03:26:29,740
Okay.

7084
03:26:31,160 --> 03:26:31,900
Who's on my team?

7085
03:26:31,940 --> 03:26:32,480
Who's on my team right now?

7086
03:26:32,940 --> 03:26:35,240
I don't think this is a team game.

7087
03:26:35,580 --> 03:26:36,120
I don't...

7088
03:26:36,740 --> 03:26:38,580
Dude, this game is garbage.

7089
03:26:38,820 --> 03:26:39,980
This is not a game.

7090
03:26:40,400 --> 03:26:41,760
There's no skill involved.

7091
03:26:42,800 --> 03:26:44,360
Hold one button, dude.

7092
03:26:44,440 --> 03:26:46,260
This is not a game.

7093
03:26:46,260 --> 03:26:49,060
Dude, Hyuna is like a well-woven machine at this, bro.

7094
03:26:49,180 --> 03:26:49,380
This is a real game.

7095
03:26:49,380 --> 03:26:50,900
It's just not a real game.

7096
03:26:51,560 --> 03:26:52,080
Hyuna!

7097
03:26:54,460 --> 03:26:54,980
Hyuna!

7098
03:26:54,980 --> 03:26:55,980
I'm going, I'm going.

7099
03:26:55,980 --> 03:26:57,160
This is not a real game.

7100
03:26:57,560 --> 03:26:59,140
This is not a real game.

7101
03:27:00,880 --> 03:27:02,520
That was a 2v2 game.

7102
03:27:02,820 --> 03:27:04,340
Yeah, it was a team effort.

7103
03:27:05,340 --> 03:27:08,160
Yeah, it was a team effort.

7104
03:27:08,420 --> 03:27:09,320
Oh, my god.

7105
03:27:09,560 --> 03:27:11,780
They say we're playing undercooked.

7106
03:27:11,880 --> 03:27:13,140
Bro, that's crazy.

7107
03:27:16,100 --> 03:27:17,300
Oh, my god.

7108
03:27:17,400 --> 03:27:18,040
Jesus Christ.

7109
03:27:18,420 --> 03:27:19,320
Give me that crown.

7110
03:27:19,360 --> 03:27:19,720
Oh, my god.

7111
03:27:19,720 --> 03:27:21,140
I want to have a crown, too.

7112
03:27:21,700 --> 03:27:22,360
Doki, no.

7113
03:27:22,840 --> 03:27:24,520
All of us had crowns.

7114
03:27:24,520 --> 03:27:26,000
I want to be special, too.

7115
03:27:26,080 --> 03:27:27,120
No, you're not allowed.

7116
03:27:27,180 --> 03:27:27,620
You're forbidden.

7117
03:27:27,960 --> 03:27:28,920
Spawn near me for once in my life.

7118
03:27:30,080 --> 03:27:31,500
For once in my life.

7119
03:27:31,500 --> 03:27:31,880
Yay!

7120
03:27:35,480 --> 03:27:35,880
Nice.

7121
03:27:36,200 --> 03:27:37,140
Spawn next to me.

7122
03:27:37,220 --> 03:27:37,360
No!

7123
03:27:38,040 --> 03:27:39,100
Spawn next to me.

7124
03:27:39,160 --> 03:27:40,080
This is bad.

7125
03:27:40,160 --> 03:27:40,960
This is bad.

7126
03:27:43,800 --> 03:27:45,460
It's kind of near me, I guess.

7127
03:27:45,640 --> 03:27:47,680
Why are they just not going anywhere other than me, bro?

7128
03:27:47,760 --> 03:27:49,800
It's like it's probably avoiding my ass.

7129
03:27:50,120 --> 03:27:50,520
It's not too far away.

7130
03:27:51,580 --> 03:27:52,060
Please.

7131
03:27:52,540 --> 03:27:53,020
Please.

7132
03:27:53,420 --> 03:27:54,220
Alright, a bonus.

7133
03:27:54,340 --> 03:27:54,780
It's winnable.

7134
03:27:57,460 --> 03:27:58,420
Dash block?

7135
03:27:58,720 --> 03:27:59,300
What's that?

7136
03:27:59,660 --> 03:28:00,920
It's like a mushroom.

7137
03:28:01,560 --> 03:28:03,060
Oh, that's kind of good, though.

7138
03:28:04,080 --> 03:28:05,400
Yeah, it's super good.

7139
03:28:05,960 --> 03:28:06,580
Let's go.

7140
03:28:07,080 --> 03:28:08,800
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

7141
03:28:09,120 --> 03:28:10,500
It's Donka's turn.

7142
03:28:11,260 --> 03:28:11,740
Donka's.

7143
03:28:13,460 --> 03:28:14,300
Oh, wait.

7144
03:28:14,360 --> 03:28:15,880
Donka's can do this.

7145
03:28:17,040 --> 03:28:19,420
Oh, Donka's can do this.

7146
03:28:19,420 --> 03:28:20,400
She's warping.

7147
03:28:20,440 --> 03:28:21,800
I bought it from the shop.

7148
03:28:21,960 --> 03:28:23,980
And she's got 16 coins.

7149
03:28:24,060 --> 03:28:26,280
Why does my shop have a crown warp?

7150
03:28:26,420 --> 03:28:27,460
That doesn't seem right.

7151
03:28:28,080 --> 03:28:31,280
Yeah, why does it not have one?

7152
03:28:32,840 --> 03:28:34,040
Your shop's poor.

7153
03:28:34,400 --> 03:28:34,740
Oh, wait.

7154
03:28:34,760 --> 03:28:35,520
You bought that?

7155
03:28:36,500 --> 03:28:38,020
Yeah, now she's first.

7156
03:28:38,180 --> 03:28:39,820
Now I have one coin.

7157
03:28:39,820 --> 03:28:41,480
Yo, she's juiced.

7158
03:28:41,700 --> 03:28:43,840
She needs one more crown and she wins.

7159
03:28:44,000 --> 03:28:45,120
She's juiced, bro.

7160
03:28:45,520 --> 03:28:46,040
Donka's...

7161
03:28:47,040 --> 03:28:48,540
Donka's donking right now.

7162
03:28:48,800 --> 03:28:49,840
Holy Christ.

7163
03:28:50,620 --> 03:28:52,740
Wait, Sykkuno's close to the second one.

7164
03:28:53,740 --> 03:28:54,400
Am I?

7165
03:28:54,620 --> 03:28:56,620
Yeah, it's literally at the bottom left.

7166
03:28:57,240 --> 03:28:58,860
Dude, I'm facing the opposite direction.

7167
03:28:58,860 --> 03:29:00,620
Please, for the love of God, let me in the big room.

7168
03:29:00,780 --> 03:29:03,160
I think I'm going the opposite direction.

7169
03:29:03,560 --> 03:29:04,400
Come on!

7170
03:29:04,840 --> 03:29:05,360
Go!

7171
03:29:06,100 --> 03:29:07,140
Go, Shrek!

7172
03:29:07,140 --> 03:29:07,540
He's almost there!

7173
03:29:07,680 --> 03:29:08,380
He's gonna win!

7174
03:29:08,840 --> 03:29:10,180
Go up that ladder, dude.

7175
03:29:10,320 --> 03:29:11,740
Is the ladder up there better?

7176
03:29:11,960 --> 03:29:13,240
Oh, no.

7177
03:29:13,540 --> 03:29:14,500
I don't know actually.

7178
03:29:14,500 --> 03:29:15,140
You lose a turn.

7179
03:29:15,400 --> 03:29:15,860
No!

7180
03:29:15,860 --> 03:29:17,000
Get to the shop!

7181
03:29:17,200 --> 03:29:17,680
Use!

7182
03:29:18,260 --> 03:29:19,040
No, it's not!

7183
03:29:19,200 --> 03:29:20,280
That's not part of the pathway.

7184
03:29:20,520 --> 03:29:22,040
After the shop, he loses a turn.

7185
03:29:22,040 --> 03:29:22,440
No!

7186
03:29:25,340 --> 03:29:25,820
Sykkuno!

7187
03:29:25,820 --> 03:29:27,380
You screwed me again!

7188
03:29:27,800 --> 03:29:30,140
To be fair, I didn't know that would happen.

7189
03:29:30,140 --> 03:29:30,700
You screwed me again!

7190
03:29:30,700 --> 03:29:31,980
I genuinely didn't know.

7191
03:29:33,640 --> 03:29:35,260
Gold and dice attack!

7192
03:29:35,880 --> 03:29:36,520
Oh, God.

7193
03:29:37,140 --> 03:29:39,120
And then, big roll up.

7194
03:29:39,220 --> 03:29:39,840
Big roll up.

7195
03:29:40,600 --> 03:29:41,920
I thought you were backwards.

7196
03:29:42,660 --> 03:29:43,180
Ten!

7197
03:29:45,200 --> 03:29:47,020
Thirty coins for a crown?

7198
03:29:47,580 --> 03:29:50,700
Dude, since when did it cost thirty coins for a crown?

7199
03:29:51,180 --> 03:29:51,820
Dude, since when did it cost thirty coins for a crown?

7200
03:29:51,820 --> 03:29:52,640
Dude, why is it so expensive?

7201
03:29:52,680 --> 03:29:53,460
Dude, what's happening?

7202
03:29:53,620 --> 03:29:54,040
What am I doing?

7203
03:29:54,300 --> 03:29:55,560
I thought coins were only fifteen.

7204
03:29:55,560 --> 03:29:57,240
You stole my crown, you dick!

7205
03:29:57,640 --> 03:29:59,340
Oh, my God, dude.

7206
03:29:59,500 --> 03:30:02,700
No wonder it's thirty coins for a crown.

7207
03:30:02,920 --> 03:30:04,740
There is no way you jack mine.

7208
03:30:04,740 --> 03:30:05,380
No wonder.

7209
03:30:06,040 --> 03:30:06,920
Oh, my God.

7210
03:30:07,140 --> 03:30:07,940
It makes so much sense.

7211
03:30:08,360 --> 03:30:09,500
I've got nothing.

7212
03:30:09,880 --> 03:30:13,160
I was like, why is it charging me thirty coins for a crown?

7213
03:30:13,160 --> 03:30:14,940
This is like Monopoly all over again.

7214
03:30:15,140 --> 03:30:17,060
This is Monopoly all over again.

7215
03:30:17,920 --> 03:30:18,760
Wait, what do you mean?

7216
03:30:18,800 --> 03:30:19,380
You won Monopoly?

7217
03:30:19,480 --> 03:30:19,940
Barely.

7218
03:30:19,940 --> 03:30:22,500
You're saying you're going to win this one too?

7219
03:30:22,580 --> 03:30:23,320
The reverse sweep.

7220
03:30:25,200 --> 03:30:26,040
He's doubling down.

7221
03:30:27,480 --> 03:30:29,480
Wait, Sykkuno wins this minigame?

7222
03:30:29,520 --> 03:30:29,880
He wins.

7223
03:30:30,500 --> 03:30:31,200
Obstacle dash.

7224
03:30:31,920 --> 03:30:33,800
Dude, and I'm an obstacle dasher.

7225
03:30:33,800 --> 03:30:36,880
I'm an obstacle dash expert, you could say.

7226
03:30:37,000 --> 03:30:37,660
Here we go.

7227
03:30:37,800 --> 03:30:38,620
Here we go.

7228
03:30:38,700 --> 03:30:39,580
Oh, it's parkour time.

7229
03:30:41,480 --> 03:30:43,220
Oh, what the fuck?

7230
03:30:43,320 --> 03:30:44,140
Wait, what the heck?

7231
03:30:45,460 --> 03:30:46,820
I'm dead, bro.

7232
03:30:46,920 --> 03:30:48,060
This is cooked, bro.

7233
03:30:48,160 --> 03:30:48,620
What?

7234
03:30:51,060 --> 03:30:52,800
How do you play this?

7235
03:30:52,860 --> 03:30:53,680
That's what I'm saying.

7236
03:30:53,780 --> 03:30:55,340
Dude, what is this game, dude?

7237
03:30:55,760 --> 03:30:58,260
I think you have to avoid the glowing stuff.

7238
03:31:00,340 --> 03:31:03,380
Why do they have no explanation for any of these games?

7239
03:31:04,060 --> 03:31:08,240
Who invented this and was like, I'm not going to tell you how to play anything and you just die.

7240
03:31:08,260 --> 03:31:08,660
Dude, it just...

7241
03:31:09,120 --> 03:31:09,820
I go...

7242
03:31:10,960 --> 03:31:12,460
The timing of that was so off.

7243
03:31:12,600 --> 03:31:13,320
It was so weird.

7244
03:31:15,340 --> 03:31:17,100
That was so strange, bro.

7245
03:31:17,100 --> 03:31:18,400
They didn't tell us a single dang thing.

7246
03:31:18,400 --> 03:31:19,540
They didn't tell you how to play.

7247
03:31:19,840 --> 03:31:21,440
I literally don't get it.

7248
03:31:21,480 --> 03:31:24,660
Dude, I'm pivoting to modern Shrek after if I lose this to Elem.

7249
03:31:24,920 --> 03:31:26,440
You're pivoting to modern Shrek?

7250
03:31:26,440 --> 03:31:28,520
I'm pivoting to modern Shrek after.

7251
03:31:28,940 --> 03:31:29,920
I need some new fucking ground.

7252
03:31:30,720 --> 03:31:31,660
Holy shit, dude.

7253
03:31:33,380 --> 03:31:33,480
I need to find this.

7254
03:31:35,640 --> 03:31:36,940
What do you mean?

7255
03:31:37,020 --> 03:31:37,720
I can reverse sweep.

7256
03:31:37,980 --> 03:31:39,300
Wait a minute.

7257
03:31:40,200 --> 03:31:40,960
Wait a second.

7258
03:31:42,060 --> 03:31:45,460
Why are you jockeying me with my money?

7259
03:31:45,980 --> 03:31:46,500
Dude.

7260
03:31:47,780 --> 03:31:48,300
Yuna.

7261
03:31:49,480 --> 03:31:50,000
Yuna.

7262
03:31:51,220 --> 03:31:52,520
Nice job, Yuna.

7263
03:31:52,620 --> 03:31:55,260
It only takes like five.

7264
03:31:56,020 --> 03:31:56,860
Five coins.

7265
03:31:57,040 --> 03:31:58,400
Only five shekels.

7266
03:31:58,460 --> 03:31:59,560
And I lose a ton.

7267
03:31:59,760 --> 03:32:00,280
I'm poor.

7268
03:32:00,300 --> 03:32:01,000
I had one.

7269
03:32:03,380 --> 03:32:03,840
I lost the crown.

7270
03:32:04,020 --> 03:32:06,060
I lost my money all in one turn.

7271
03:32:06,240 --> 03:32:07,820
That makes that is crazy.

7272
03:32:08,620 --> 03:32:10,040
That is crazy.

7273
03:32:11,480 --> 03:32:14,520
Saikudo might actually get the crown and win.

7274
03:32:14,580 --> 03:32:15,600
There's no way.

7275
03:32:15,640 --> 03:32:18,680
He gets a double dice?

7276
03:32:19,140 --> 03:32:19,580
Seven.

7277
03:32:20,000 --> 03:32:21,960
He actually wins.

7278
03:32:21,960 --> 03:32:22,740
I don't have enough money.

7279
03:32:23,400 --> 03:32:26,380
I stole the crown from Elem.

7280
03:32:26,420 --> 03:32:28,100
Holy crap, bro.

7281
03:32:28,300 --> 03:32:29,240
Oh my god.

7282
03:32:29,240 --> 03:32:30,140
Oh my god.

7283
03:32:30,200 --> 03:32:32,140
There's actually no way.

7284
03:32:32,260 --> 03:32:34,700
Does anyone else get to play this game?

7285
03:32:34,940 --> 03:32:36,860
Hany avoided the double freeze as well.

7286
03:32:37,040 --> 03:32:37,540
It's crazy.

7287
03:32:38,980 --> 03:32:40,700
You're losing your three coins.

7288
03:32:41,860 --> 03:32:43,840
I just need to win this minigame, right?

7289
03:32:43,900 --> 03:32:45,320
Yeah, you just need to win a minigame.

7290
03:32:45,320 --> 03:32:45,780
And you win.

7291
03:32:46,040 --> 03:32:47,980
Just give us obstacle dash again.

7292
03:32:48,320 --> 03:32:49,960
Run it back.

7293
03:32:50,160 --> 03:32:51,880
We learned how to play borders.

7294
03:32:52,500 --> 03:32:53,440
It's a team game.

7295
03:32:53,740 --> 03:32:55,540
Can we get some instructions for once?

7296
03:32:56,040 --> 03:32:57,320
Saikudo's team just needs to throw.

7297
03:32:57,340 --> 03:32:58,360
Is that too much to ask for?

7298
03:32:58,460 --> 03:32:59,560
What are we doing?

7299
03:33:00,600 --> 03:33:02,020
Wait, do we grab stuff?

7300
03:33:02,740 --> 03:33:03,100
Wait.

7301
03:33:04,620 --> 03:33:07,680
Am I trying to get it red or am I trying to get it blue?

7302
03:33:07,840 --> 03:33:08,400
You're trying to get it blue.

7303
03:33:09,120 --> 03:33:11,240
Dude, I just inted myself.

7304
03:33:11,580 --> 03:33:12,660
You're trying to get it to blue.

7305
03:33:12,900 --> 03:33:13,320
Get in blue.

7306
03:33:16,920 --> 03:33:17,940
The golden ball.

7307
03:33:18,180 --> 03:33:19,080
Get in blue quick.

7308
03:33:19,140 --> 03:33:19,500
To blue.

7309
03:33:21,980 --> 03:33:23,260
I'm supposed to get it to red.

7310
03:33:23,400 --> 03:33:24,080
You guys are idiots.

7311
03:33:24,280 --> 03:33:25,240
You guys are actually idiots.

7312
03:33:25,840 --> 03:33:27,620
Dude, I scored on ourselves.

7313
03:33:28,100 --> 03:33:30,540
I'm saying Saikudo wins in your last place.

7314
03:33:30,700 --> 03:33:31,420
Yeah, honestly.

7315
03:33:31,960 --> 03:33:32,440
Wait a second.

7316
03:33:32,600 --> 03:33:33,140
Int it.

7317
03:33:33,220 --> 03:33:33,560
Int it.

7318
03:33:33,580 --> 03:33:33,980
Turn it on.

7319
03:33:34,060 --> 03:33:34,400
Turn it on.

7320
03:33:34,420 --> 03:33:34,760
Turn it on.

7321
03:33:35,820 --> 03:33:37,460
Dude, Ellen, we've got to win this, man.

7322
03:33:37,740 --> 03:33:39,420
You need the tokens, though, too.

7323
03:33:39,720 --> 03:33:40,080
Int.

7324
03:33:40,140 --> 03:33:40,500
Int.

7325
03:33:41,000 --> 03:33:41,360
Int.

7326
03:33:41,700 --> 03:33:43,400
You have to win this.

7327
03:33:43,860 --> 03:33:45,960
Ellen, we've got to win this, man.

7328
03:33:47,140 --> 03:33:47,500
Int.

7329
03:33:47,500 --> 03:33:47,860
Int.

7330
03:33:48,820 --> 03:33:50,300
Ellen, we've got to win this, dude.

7331
03:33:50,420 --> 03:33:51,580
Dude, you're going to get coins.

7332
03:33:52,360 --> 03:33:53,640
You're going to get coins, bro.

7333
03:33:54,040 --> 03:33:54,900
Guys, get them in.

7334
03:33:55,540 --> 03:33:56,540
Guys, I'm blocking them.

7335
03:33:56,600 --> 03:33:57,460
Guys, you've got to get them in.

7336
03:33:57,560 --> 03:33:58,280
Guys, one more.

7337
03:33:58,400 --> 03:33:59,100
Guys, please.

7338
03:33:59,420 --> 03:33:59,800
Yes.

7339
03:34:02,900 --> 03:34:04,080
He goalied you.

7340
03:34:04,300 --> 03:34:06,400
Dude, he actually inted you, psychopath.

7341
03:34:06,640 --> 03:34:07,080
Why?

7342
03:34:08,460 --> 03:34:09,220
That's so funny.

7343
03:34:09,220 --> 03:34:10,920
Dude, now Huun's going to win.

7344
03:34:10,940 --> 03:34:12,660
You've thrown the game, you fool.

7345
03:34:13,240 --> 03:34:14,560
You've thrown the game.

7346
03:34:16,120 --> 03:34:16,940
Oh, my God.

7347
03:34:17,840 --> 03:34:19,320
Oh, my God.

7348
03:34:19,480 --> 03:34:20,680
Dude, Huun wins now.

7349
03:34:20,740 --> 03:34:22,140
She's right by the crown.

7350
03:34:22,180 --> 03:34:22,440
She's not.

7351
03:34:22,560 --> 03:34:23,200
She's not.

7352
03:34:23,260 --> 03:34:24,320
She's not.

7353
03:34:24,320 --> 03:34:25,180
She's really right by the crown.

7354
03:34:25,200 --> 03:34:26,180
You've handed her the win.

7355
03:34:26,500 --> 03:34:28,280
You've handed her the win, you fool.

7356
03:34:28,880 --> 03:34:30,440
I've been 3v1'd again.

7357
03:34:32,200 --> 03:34:33,680
How is it possible?

7358
03:34:34,040 --> 03:34:35,760
Getting 3v1'd in every game.

7359
03:34:36,000 --> 03:34:37,020
There is no way.

7360
03:34:37,320 --> 03:34:38,760
You're just too powerful.

7361
03:34:38,760 --> 03:34:39,260
Oh, God.

7362
03:34:39,260 --> 03:34:40,680
There's actually no fucking way.

7363
03:34:40,680 --> 03:34:41,780
She literally wins now, Ellen.

7364
03:34:42,480 --> 03:34:43,780
Unless if I roll a 1.

7365
03:34:46,960 --> 03:34:48,280
I can't believe it.

7366
03:34:48,480 --> 03:34:50,860
I've been 3v1'd again.

7367
03:34:50,860 --> 03:34:52,920
I've been 3v1'd again.

7368
03:34:53,160 --> 03:34:54,800
Why didn't you tell me?

7369
03:34:55,600 --> 03:34:56,920
I've been 3v1'd.

7370
03:34:56,960 --> 03:34:59,360
I feel like that's the conscious decision you made, man.

7371
03:34:59,620 --> 03:35:01,560
That's the conscious decision you made.

7372
03:35:01,560 --> 03:35:02,820
That's not even a secret thing.

7373
03:35:02,820 --> 03:35:03,800
Why wouldn't you just tell me?

7374
03:35:03,960 --> 03:35:06,620
Your alliance is just not there.

7375
03:35:06,860 --> 03:35:09,080
Your alliance is just so fragile.

7376
03:35:09,560 --> 03:35:10,080
Pathetic.

7377
03:35:10,080 --> 03:35:10,360
Pathetic.

7378
03:35:11,660 --> 03:35:12,480
Run it back.

7379
03:35:12,600 --> 03:35:13,000
Run it back.

7380
03:35:13,000 --> 03:35:14,600
What happened to this alliance?

7381
03:35:14,780 --> 03:35:15,560
Run it back.

7382
03:35:15,620 --> 03:35:16,280
Run it back.

7383
03:35:16,980 --> 03:35:18,160
Is there no time to?

7384
03:35:18,300 --> 03:35:18,760
I mean...

7385
03:35:20,860 --> 03:35:21,060
Run it back.

7386
03:35:22,100 --> 03:35:23,620
This is a fast game.

7387
03:35:24,040 --> 03:35:24,900
It is a fast game.

7388
03:35:26,620 --> 03:35:27,420
Oh, yeah.

7389
03:35:28,340 --> 03:35:30,300
I can't believe he did that.

7390
03:35:30,840 --> 03:35:32,300
Dude, I can't believe he did that.

7391
03:35:32,880 --> 03:35:33,400
That's it.

7392
03:35:34,320 --> 03:35:35,140
I didn't know.

7393
03:35:35,240 --> 03:35:36,080
You didn't tell me.

7394
03:35:36,120 --> 03:35:38,180
I was trying to make the game go on longer.

7395
03:35:38,280 --> 03:35:39,960
And you, sir, didn't say.

7396
03:35:40,040 --> 03:35:42,940
I didn't tell you that if you inted, someone else would win.

7397
03:35:43,140 --> 03:35:44,440
I didn't think I had to.

7398
03:35:44,440 --> 03:35:46,520
I didn't think that was a thing I had to describe.

7399
03:35:46,520 --> 03:35:48,840
I didn't know if Huun won, she would've won the whole thing.

7400
03:35:48,840 --> 03:35:49,260
I'm going to Atlantis.

7401
03:35:49,260 --> 03:35:50,160
You bumbling fool.

7402
03:35:51,180 --> 03:35:51,960
I'm coming to Atlantis.

7403
03:35:52,080 --> 03:35:53,240
Are you guys still in the lobby?

7404
03:35:53,400 --> 03:35:54,240
You threw the game, man.

7405
03:35:56,880 --> 03:35:57,580
Communicate with me.

7406
03:35:58,380 --> 03:35:59,240
You bumbling fool.

7407
03:36:00,100 --> 03:36:03,820
How do I have to tell you throwing the game would result in you throwing the game?

7408
03:36:04,320 --> 03:36:04,900
That's so obvious.

7409
03:36:06,100 --> 03:36:07,080
On what planet?

7410
03:36:07,200 --> 03:36:08,400
I'm going to Atlantis.

7411
03:36:08,640 --> 03:36:10,360
I've already been in Atlantis.

7412
03:36:10,420 --> 03:36:12,120
I've already been here, so this is my place now.

7413
03:36:12,460 --> 03:36:13,780
Oh, God.

7414
03:36:15,180 --> 03:36:17,460
Okay, as long as I don't last this time, it'll be fine.

7415
03:36:17,460 --> 03:36:19,260
As long as I don't get lost, then yeah.

7416
03:36:19,300 --> 03:36:21,280
I don't want to get fourth again.

7417
03:36:21,480 --> 03:36:21,720
You know what I mean?

7418
03:36:23,300 --> 03:36:24,060
Here we go.

7419
03:36:25,100 --> 03:36:26,460
You didn't get fourth, you got second.

7420
03:36:27,060 --> 03:36:27,600
What do you mean?

7421
03:36:29,140 --> 03:36:30,080
I got fourth.

7422
03:36:30,320 --> 03:36:31,700
I mean, second is the first to lose.

7423
03:36:33,680 --> 03:36:34,480
That's a good house to go, dude.

7424
03:36:35,360 --> 03:36:36,000
Oh, God.

7425
03:36:36,200 --> 03:36:36,640
Okay, here we go.

7426
03:36:37,060 --> 03:36:37,920
Big roll, big roll.

7427
03:36:38,080 --> 03:36:38,520
What'd I get?

7428
03:36:39,160 --> 03:36:39,780
A seven?

7429
03:36:41,060 --> 03:36:41,700
A three?

7430
03:36:41,860 --> 03:36:42,300
I won!

7431
03:36:42,900 --> 03:36:43,840
I won!

7432
03:36:44,160 --> 03:36:47,820
The world does not want me to win.

7433
03:36:48,400 --> 03:36:50,380
It's decided I'm a loser.

7434
03:36:50,540 --> 03:36:52,320
It's decided I'm a loser.

7435
03:36:52,400 --> 03:36:53,920
But you know what?

7436
03:36:54,100 --> 03:36:56,280
I can turn that around by locking in Modern Zangief.

7437
03:36:56,420 --> 03:36:57,340
That'll make me a winner.

7438
03:36:57,900 --> 03:36:58,860
That's the day.

7439
03:36:59,100 --> 03:37:00,780
Tomorrow you're gonna win.

7440
03:37:02,700 --> 03:37:03,740
Holy Christ.

7441
03:37:04,960 --> 03:37:05,840
Alright, this way.

7442
03:37:06,060 --> 03:37:09,520
Oh, hey, I get to go further ahead and lose.

7443
03:37:09,560 --> 03:37:10,460
No, I don't.

7444
03:37:12,780 --> 03:37:13,220
Jesus.

7445
03:37:14,840 --> 03:37:15,280
Okay.

7446
03:37:19,130 --> 03:37:19,990
Lock it in.

7447
03:37:20,110 --> 03:37:20,730
Lock it in.

7448
03:37:21,010 --> 03:37:21,770
No, I'm rolling.

7449
03:37:23,110 --> 03:37:24,730
Bam, bam, ba-ba-bam.

7450
03:37:26,370 --> 03:37:27,450
Chat, we're vibing.

7451
03:37:27,590 --> 03:37:28,870
He's not the protagonist, dude.

7452
03:37:29,290 --> 03:37:29,950
It's crazy.

7453
03:37:30,170 --> 03:37:31,670
I mean, I'm already going to the crown.

7454
03:37:31,750 --> 03:37:32,830
I can't take it anymore.

7455
03:37:35,890 --> 03:37:36,810
Holy shit, dude.

7456
03:37:36,810 --> 03:37:38,110
What an interesting map.

7457
03:37:39,130 --> 03:37:40,690
It's kinda weird.

7458
03:37:42,050 --> 03:37:43,390
What, your binds are in the shop?

7459
03:37:44,850 --> 03:37:46,250
There's no way anyone's got money.

7460
03:37:46,310 --> 03:37:47,510
A bag of coins.

7461
03:37:47,530 --> 03:37:49,550
You can buy a bag of coins?

7462
03:37:49,570 --> 03:37:50,530
That doesn't make any sense.

7463
03:37:50,530 --> 03:37:51,930
How much was a bag of coins?

7464
03:37:52,710 --> 03:37:54,710
I assume five coins is all she had.

7465
03:37:55,290 --> 03:37:57,450
But that means you can just make money back on it.

7466
03:37:58,410 --> 03:37:58,810
Yeah.

7467
03:37:58,930 --> 03:38:00,310
It doesn't make any sense.

7468
03:38:01,350 --> 03:38:02,270
Okay, alright.

7469
03:38:03,590 --> 03:38:05,170
And then you get three as well.

7470
03:38:05,270 --> 03:38:06,490
Wait, that is so broken.

7471
03:38:06,710 --> 03:38:07,850
Big roll me, big roll me.

7472
03:38:08,250 --> 03:38:08,830
A three.

7473
03:38:09,410 --> 03:38:10,950
A classic three.

7474
03:38:11,050 --> 03:38:12,150
Big money, big money.

7475
03:38:12,370 --> 03:38:12,990
Come on now.

7476
03:38:13,650 --> 03:38:16,490
But I get to roll again thanks to my special ability.

7477
03:38:16,750 --> 03:38:17,830
Dimension the dice.

7478
03:38:18,010 --> 03:38:19,770
But you can't buy anything.

7479
03:38:20,030 --> 03:38:20,790
You blundering fool.

7480
03:38:22,690 --> 03:38:24,670
And then, dimension the dice.

7481
03:38:24,730 --> 03:38:25,390
I roll again.

7482
03:38:25,810 --> 03:38:28,230
Wait, how is he still a ten?

7483
03:38:28,450 --> 03:38:29,770
Wait, how did you have so much dice?

7484
03:38:30,990 --> 03:38:32,590
How far away am I from this?

7485
03:38:32,810 --> 03:38:33,890
How is he doing this?

7486
03:38:34,270 --> 03:38:35,950
Wait, how do you have so much dice?

7487
03:38:36,670 --> 03:38:38,630
He was doing dimension the dice.

7488
03:38:38,950 --> 03:38:39,350
Where am I going right now?

7489
03:38:39,350 --> 03:38:40,430
Did you pay for this?

7490
03:38:41,050 --> 03:38:44,910
Yeah, I just want to let you guys know I could have bought it if I had money.

7491
03:38:45,170 --> 03:38:47,370
Did you like buy more dice to play?

7492
03:38:47,610 --> 03:38:48,210
No, he's just gone.

7493
03:38:48,310 --> 03:38:48,710
I'm going down.

7494
03:38:48,970 --> 03:38:50,510
I'm going solid snack mode.

7495
03:38:50,830 --> 03:38:52,190
Why am I climbing back up?

7496
03:38:52,210 --> 03:38:53,130
That doesn't make sense.

7497
03:38:53,410 --> 03:38:53,810
What?

7498
03:38:54,370 --> 03:38:56,810
Dude, what is happening in this game?

7499
03:38:56,810 --> 03:38:58,690
Why are you going up and jumping on buffers, dude?

7500
03:38:59,290 --> 03:39:00,310
What is happening?

7501
03:39:00,590 --> 03:39:01,710
Wait, he can steal coins.

7502
03:39:01,790 --> 03:39:04,250
He's stealing coins.

7503
03:39:06,730 --> 03:39:08,030
Well, I can't steal from him.

7504
03:39:08,110 --> 03:39:09,690
Are you joking me?

7505
03:39:10,090 --> 03:39:12,030
You steal from me again?

7506
03:39:12,310 --> 03:39:13,090
What happened to the alliance?

7507
03:39:13,430 --> 03:39:14,350
What happened to the alliance?

7508
03:39:15,650 --> 03:39:16,570
What are you doing?

7509
03:39:16,590 --> 03:39:17,370
I can't steal from Dote.

7510
03:39:17,510 --> 03:39:19,690
Dude, you threw last game for someone else to win.

7511
03:39:19,770 --> 03:39:21,990
You didn't communicate with me.

7512
03:39:22,170 --> 03:39:24,630
If you communicated, we would have been fine.

7513
03:39:24,810 --> 03:39:26,950
If you throw the game, you're going to throw the game.

7514
03:39:26,990 --> 03:39:27,710
You're an idiot.

7515
03:39:28,130 --> 03:39:29,730
I feel like it was so obvious.

7516
03:39:29,790 --> 03:39:32,710
I didn't think I had to say, if you throw this game, it'll be thrown.

7517
03:39:33,510 --> 03:39:35,110
I just felt like that was an obvious.

7518
03:39:35,950 --> 03:39:36,670
I didn't think that required it.

7519
03:39:36,670 --> 03:39:37,650
You shouldn't assume.

7520
03:39:39,890 --> 03:39:41,130
What is this?

7521
03:39:41,990 --> 03:39:42,970
Tickling time bomb?

7522
03:39:43,110 --> 03:39:43,430
What's that?

7523
03:39:44,910 --> 03:39:46,450
Surely they'll explain something.

7524
03:39:46,670 --> 03:39:48,410
Yeah, surely we'll understand, right?

7525
03:39:48,510 --> 03:39:49,850
Pass the bomb to another player.

7526
03:39:50,030 --> 03:39:50,990
How do I pass it?

7527
03:39:51,010 --> 03:39:52,110
How do I pass it?

7528
03:39:52,770 --> 03:39:53,750
How do I pass it?

7529
03:39:56,710 --> 03:39:57,590
You dick!

7530
03:39:58,130 --> 03:40:00,510
Why did you target me, you asshole?

7531
03:40:01,090 --> 03:40:02,910
You're literally right next to me.

7532
03:40:02,910 --> 03:40:04,230
Wait, I didn't click on him.

7533
03:40:04,230 --> 03:40:05,190
Oh no.

7534
03:40:05,190 --> 03:40:06,050
You have to click?

7535
03:40:06,510 --> 03:40:07,790
You have to click it?

7536
03:40:07,850 --> 03:40:08,670
I guess you do.

7537
03:40:10,710 --> 03:40:11,390
Oh shit.

7538
03:40:11,510 --> 03:40:12,090
Oh my god.

7539
03:40:12,210 --> 03:40:12,750
Oh my god.

7540
03:40:13,530 --> 03:40:14,050
Yes!

7541
03:40:15,670 --> 03:40:16,150
Yes!

7542
03:40:17,490 --> 03:40:18,010
You!

7543
03:40:18,810 --> 03:40:20,650
Nobody can stop Iron Mouse.

7544
03:40:20,730 --> 03:40:22,190
There is no way, bro.

7545
03:40:22,370 --> 03:40:24,130
There is no way, dude.

7546
03:40:24,830 --> 03:40:25,750
Big gameplay.

7547
03:40:27,690 --> 03:40:29,770
The wall isn't even real.

7548
03:40:30,030 --> 03:40:31,470
Yeah, the wall's not real.

7549
03:40:32,390 --> 03:40:34,470
I was like, can I glitch this through the wall?

7550
03:40:34,630 --> 03:40:35,850
Holy shit, dude.

7551
03:40:35,850 --> 03:40:36,450
I was like, what the fuck?

7552
03:40:36,490 --> 03:40:37,690
You passed it to me?

7553
03:40:38,950 --> 03:40:39,750
Where do I go?

7554
03:40:39,770 --> 03:40:40,950
I slipped it around the wall.

7555
03:40:41,050 --> 03:40:41,830
Wait, I gotta play it.

7556
03:40:41,890 --> 03:40:42,050
Wait.

7557
03:40:43,830 --> 03:40:45,110
Oh, I wish I could use it.

7558
03:40:46,030 --> 03:40:47,130
That's what I'm thinking.

7559
03:40:47,130 --> 03:40:49,010
That's what I was thinking, but now I can't do it.

7560
03:40:50,290 --> 03:40:50,650
Onwards.

7561
03:40:51,330 --> 03:40:51,690
Onwards.

7562
03:40:52,610 --> 03:40:54,150
Wait, am I facing the wrong way now?

7563
03:40:54,150 --> 03:40:54,590
Yeah, you are.

7564
03:40:56,350 --> 03:40:56,710
Yes!

7565
03:40:59,110 --> 03:41:00,470
You got your two more!

7566
03:41:01,470 --> 03:41:01,950
I'm not even gonna buy it.

7567
03:41:02,350 --> 03:41:05,090
Dude, this is just ridiculous.

7568
03:41:05,290 --> 03:41:06,830
I don't think anybody can buy it right now.

7569
03:41:06,910 --> 03:41:09,150
No shot, dude.

7570
03:41:10,130 --> 03:41:12,290
There is no a way.

7571
03:41:13,310 --> 03:41:16,170
There ain't no a way.

7572
03:41:16,470 --> 03:41:18,770
Oh my god.

7573
03:41:19,150 --> 03:41:20,710
Except I'm facing the wrong way.

7574
03:41:21,310 --> 03:41:23,190
Yeah, you're facing the wrong way.

7575
03:41:24,070 --> 03:41:24,630
Jesus.

7576
03:41:29,230 --> 03:41:30,230
You going, bro?

7577
03:41:31,470 --> 03:41:33,050
Wait, Hyun might be able to...

7578
03:41:33,050 --> 03:41:36,090
Dude, if she uses her coin pouch, yeah, this is where the money comes out.

7579
03:41:36,090 --> 03:41:36,910
That's kinda juiced.

7580
03:41:37,530 --> 03:41:40,470
If she gets a high roll here, that could be the game changer.

7581
03:41:40,650 --> 03:41:41,190
A nine!

7582
03:41:42,150 --> 03:41:43,390
Wait, she can buy it, maybe.

7583
03:41:43,930 --> 03:41:46,650
Wait, she actually can buy it if she makes it.

7584
03:41:47,170 --> 03:41:48,490
Can you make it?

7585
03:41:48,510 --> 03:41:49,750
Do you make it is the question.

7586
03:41:49,910 --> 03:41:50,910
Do you make it to it?

7587
03:41:50,970 --> 03:41:51,370
Oh, she does.

7588
03:41:51,870 --> 03:41:53,630
Yeah, she does.

7589
03:41:54,650 --> 03:41:56,390
Is this another Hyun win?

7590
03:41:56,990 --> 03:41:58,170
Dude, Hyun's gonna win again.

7591
03:41:58,170 --> 03:41:59,430
Dude, no way, no way, no way.

7592
03:41:59,610 --> 03:42:01,310
Dude, she's too powerful, bro.

7593
03:42:01,410 --> 03:42:03,270
I'm too poor, I'm too poor.

7594
03:42:03,730 --> 03:42:04,470
Wait, you are?

7595
03:42:05,430 --> 03:42:08,130
Oh, you were two coins away.

7596
03:42:09,210 --> 03:42:10,090
God dang.

7597
03:42:11,110 --> 03:42:12,710
I got a lot of money, though.

7598
03:42:12,930 --> 03:42:13,130
You were actually two coins.

7599
03:42:14,190 --> 03:42:14,630
Okay.

7600
03:42:16,250 --> 03:42:17,850
Too bad you're facing the wrong way.

7601
03:42:17,950 --> 03:42:19,270
What item do I even have?

7602
03:42:19,670 --> 03:42:20,710
Oh, I got one of these?

7603
03:42:21,950 --> 03:42:23,070
Big roll, big roll me.

7604
03:42:24,030 --> 03:42:24,890
Okay, okay, okay.

7605
03:42:25,270 --> 03:42:26,770
One, one, one, one.

7606
03:42:28,170 --> 03:42:28,550
Six.

7607
03:42:28,950 --> 03:42:31,110
Six is good, it's a classic.

7608
03:42:32,710 --> 03:42:34,390
Let's go for the spicy option here.

7609
03:42:34,850 --> 03:42:35,370
What's that?

7610
03:42:35,510 --> 03:42:36,530
Oh, he's gonna do the...

7611
03:42:37,530 --> 03:42:38,890
He's gonna do the reverse, though.

7612
03:42:39,110 --> 03:42:40,810
You're doing the reverse round, right?

7613
03:42:41,130 --> 03:42:41,850
Yeah, she did.

7614
03:42:42,650 --> 03:42:43,250
What button?

7615
03:42:44,690 --> 03:42:47,470
Oh, my God.

7616
03:42:47,790 --> 03:42:48,110
Wait, wait, wait.

7617
03:42:48,990 --> 03:42:49,430
Wait.

7618
03:42:51,790 --> 03:42:53,290
I don't even know what I'm doing, bro.

7619
03:42:53,390 --> 03:42:55,150
The coins are switched between you and...

7620
03:42:55,150 --> 03:42:56,330
I can't see.

7621
03:42:58,770 --> 03:42:59,650
Thank you.

7622
03:42:59,850 --> 03:43:01,110
No way.

7623
03:43:01,170 --> 03:43:03,730
Dude, there was no icons on the dice.

7624
03:43:04,170 --> 03:43:04,730
Wow.

7625
03:43:04,770 --> 03:43:06,410
How was I supposed to play the game?

7626
03:43:06,610 --> 03:43:08,790
There's no icons on the dice.

7627
03:43:08,810 --> 03:43:10,630
I didn't even see what happened.

7628
03:43:10,750 --> 03:43:13,330
Because the icons on the dice were flipped around.

7629
03:43:13,790 --> 03:43:16,030
This game is actually garbage.

7630
03:43:16,950 --> 03:43:17,730
Dude, dude.

7631
03:43:17,770 --> 03:43:19,010
Dude, my chat saw...

7632
03:43:19,010 --> 03:43:21,110
Guys, there were no icons on the dice.

7633
03:43:21,290 --> 03:43:23,130
How was I supposed to play that?

7634
03:43:23,190 --> 03:43:24,710
There was no icons.

7635
03:43:24,710 --> 03:43:25,130
There were no icons.

7636
03:43:25,130 --> 03:43:26,430
They were flipped backwards.

7637
03:43:26,670 --> 03:43:28,510
It doesn't even make sense.

7638
03:43:28,870 --> 03:43:31,630
Bro, that's actually insane.

7639
03:43:32,010 --> 03:43:33,750
You should have flipped it back.

7640
03:43:33,870 --> 03:43:35,010
What the frick?

7641
03:43:35,010 --> 03:43:38,490
Dude, the icons were flipped backwards on the dice.

7642
03:43:38,710 --> 03:43:39,250
It's crazy.

7643
03:43:39,270 --> 03:43:40,970
Wait, what the frick is this thing?

7644
03:43:41,030 --> 03:43:44,250
Wait, but how do you tell which one it is?

7645
03:43:44,430 --> 03:43:44,810
Yeah.

7646
03:43:45,530 --> 03:43:46,090
What?

7647
03:43:46,390 --> 03:43:48,270
Oh, it's on the poles.

7648
03:43:48,550 --> 03:43:50,510
Okay, I didn't notice that until later.

7649
03:43:50,510 --> 03:43:52,090
What the frick is this thing?

7650
03:43:52,910 --> 03:43:54,030
That's so dumb.

7651
03:43:54,450 --> 03:43:56,170
Yeah, listen.

7652
03:43:56,310 --> 03:43:59,130
No matter what bad luck happens, the minigame winner wins.

7653
03:43:59,270 --> 03:44:00,730
That's so dumb.

7654
03:44:01,270 --> 03:44:03,170
The minigame winner keeps on winning.

7655
03:44:03,310 --> 03:44:04,530
I couldn't tell how the colors were.

7656
03:44:04,870 --> 03:44:06,350
I thought about telling you.

7657
03:44:06,390 --> 03:44:08,190
Then I realized I needed that win after losing.

7658
03:44:08,530 --> 03:44:09,010
Boom.

7659
03:44:10,870 --> 03:44:12,470
Give me that sweet nine.

7660
03:44:12,470 --> 03:44:15,230
Now watch him climb down and then climb back up.

7661
03:44:15,270 --> 03:44:16,230
Wait, why does he climb back up?

7662
03:44:16,290 --> 03:44:16,870
I don't know.

7663
03:44:16,970 --> 03:44:18,050
Wait a second.

7664
03:44:18,670 --> 03:44:19,970
I can steal stuff.

7665
03:44:20,510 --> 03:44:21,570
Dude, this counts as one space.

7666
03:44:22,610 --> 03:44:23,690
Well, well, well.

7667
03:44:23,850 --> 03:44:25,010
Looks like I'm going to be...

7668
03:44:25,010 --> 03:44:27,430
Elm, if you want the alliance to be back on, hit random.

7669
03:44:27,870 --> 03:44:28,250
What?

7670
03:44:30,090 --> 03:44:32,490
This is your chance to make everything better.

7671
03:44:32,850 --> 03:44:34,350
You costed me last game.

7672
03:44:34,430 --> 03:44:35,090
Wait, I didn't choose it.

7673
03:44:35,210 --> 03:44:37,610
Why did you choose me, you psycho?

7674
03:44:37,650 --> 03:44:39,010
You already threw my last game.

7675
03:44:39,530 --> 03:44:41,270
Don't think I'll remember this one.

7676
03:44:41,330 --> 03:44:41,910
I didn't choose.

7677
03:44:42,110 --> 03:44:44,210
I swear I didn't choose.

7678
03:44:44,390 --> 03:44:45,870
No, I swear I didn't.

7679
03:44:45,870 --> 03:44:47,230
No, I didn't even click anything.

7680
03:44:47,510 --> 03:44:48,350
No, I swear.

7681
03:44:50,510 --> 03:44:51,310
Oh, free agent.

7682
03:44:52,450 --> 03:44:53,310
I swear.

7683
03:44:53,510 --> 03:44:54,530
I didn't even click anything.

7684
03:44:54,670 --> 03:44:55,010
That was great.

7685
03:44:55,010 --> 03:44:55,690
I didn't even click anything.

7686
03:44:55,750 --> 03:44:56,810
It just randomly chose you.

7687
03:44:57,050 --> 03:44:57,190
That was great.

7688
03:44:57,350 --> 03:45:02,230
I don't know about you guys, but this alliance looks mighty.

7689
03:45:02,230 --> 03:45:03,490
Dude, you're Thomas the Tank Engine.

7690
03:45:03,770 --> 03:45:05,630
He looks like he's going through something.

7691
03:45:05,770 --> 03:45:06,290
There ain't no way.

7692
03:45:07,310 --> 03:45:09,310
There ain't no way.

7693
03:45:09,610 --> 03:45:11,390
Dude, that does not look good.

7694
03:45:11,610 --> 03:45:14,530
This alliance is very shaky.

7695
03:45:16,770 --> 03:45:17,810
Holy shit.

7696
03:45:17,810 --> 03:45:19,110
He keeps stealing.

7697
03:45:19,330 --> 03:45:20,890
He threw the game last round.

7698
03:45:21,650 --> 03:45:23,890
He's just making everything go down the middle.

7699
03:45:23,890 --> 03:45:24,070
I don't know, dude.

7700
03:45:24,150 --> 03:45:24,830
It randomly...

7701
03:45:24,830 --> 03:45:25,070
What?

7702
03:45:25,150 --> 03:45:29,990
You already stole my coins because my flipping thing was backwards.

7703
03:45:30,150 --> 03:45:31,590
I didn't steal your coins.

7704
03:45:31,650 --> 03:45:33,070
You lost it yourself.

7705
03:45:33,350 --> 03:45:34,110
What do you mean?

7706
03:45:34,210 --> 03:45:34,870
It was flipped backwards.

7707
03:45:34,870 --> 03:45:36,350
It was actually flipped backwards.

7708
03:45:36,450 --> 03:45:37,250
They were blank.

7709
03:45:37,590 --> 03:45:39,550
Like the dice were blank for me.

7710
03:45:39,650 --> 03:45:41,330
And I just kept hitting space bars.

7711
03:45:43,150 --> 03:45:44,590
Holy shit, dude.

7712
03:45:44,810 --> 03:45:47,450
Holy shit, dude.

7713
03:45:48,210 --> 03:45:49,090
Almost as cook...

7714
03:45:49,090 --> 03:45:51,410
Dude, Hyun's hands and feet keep getting bigger, I swear.

7715
03:45:52,090 --> 03:45:52,930
You think so?

7716
03:45:53,110 --> 03:45:55,290
Dude, she's going to start growing extra fingers next time we see her.

7717
03:45:56,250 --> 03:45:57,090
Holy crap.

7718
03:45:57,370 --> 03:45:58,370
Look at me, man.

7719
03:45:58,670 --> 03:46:01,390
The way those feet move down the rope.

7720
03:46:01,710 --> 03:46:02,550
They're so cut.

7721
03:46:02,550 --> 03:46:05,770
Is there like a cosmetic where it makes your head into a hand or a foot?

7722
03:46:06,810 --> 03:46:07,230
What?

7723
03:46:07,270 --> 03:46:08,570
I feel like there probably would be.

7724
03:46:08,870 --> 03:46:09,830
There's got to be.

7725
03:46:10,670 --> 03:46:11,830
Roblox has like a crazy stuff.

7726
03:46:11,830 --> 03:46:13,550
You will be the lucky one today.

7727
03:46:14,550 --> 03:46:15,830
For fuck's sake.

7728
03:46:17,770 --> 03:46:18,790
Hey, thanks, dude.

7729
03:46:18,790 --> 03:46:19,330
You're a real one.

7730
03:46:19,410 --> 03:46:19,870
You're a real one.

7731
03:46:21,850 --> 03:46:23,870
I mean, she just chose randomly, Elm.

7732
03:46:23,930 --> 03:46:24,610
She chose randomly.

7733
03:46:24,910 --> 03:46:26,210
Yeah, Elm chose randomly.

7734
03:46:26,670 --> 03:46:28,010
Of course, of course, of course.

7735
03:46:28,470 --> 03:46:29,870
She used to be upset over random.

7736
03:46:29,950 --> 03:46:31,530
Yes, I could've.

7737
03:46:31,610 --> 03:46:32,950
I chose random as well.

7738
03:46:33,110 --> 03:46:34,350
Well, Elm targeted me.

7739
03:46:34,490 --> 03:46:36,870
It randomly selected you, bro.

7740
03:46:37,390 --> 03:46:38,630
Mine was random.

7741
03:46:39,530 --> 03:46:40,650
It was random.

7742
03:46:42,190 --> 03:46:43,750
Bop a two, exactly what I wanted.

7743
03:46:43,770 --> 03:46:44,990
A little three-sie, a little three-sie.

7744
03:46:45,030 --> 03:46:45,450
Okay, okay.

7745
03:46:47,450 --> 03:46:49,570
That has still not been taken yet.

7746
03:46:49,570 --> 03:46:50,710
That's actually crazy.

7747
03:46:52,330 --> 03:46:53,230
What do you got there?

7748
03:46:53,330 --> 03:46:55,530
Give us obstacle notes.

7749
03:46:55,890 --> 03:46:56,890
Pizza press, pizza press, pizza press.

7750
03:46:57,310 --> 03:46:59,330
Oh, what the frick is this?

7751
03:46:59,810 --> 03:47:02,370
Will they ever tell us how to play the games?

7752
03:47:02,550 --> 03:47:02,890
No.

7753
03:47:02,890 --> 03:47:03,490
Probably not.

7754
03:47:03,590 --> 03:47:07,070
It says ready, and then you just...

7755
03:47:07,070 --> 03:47:09,050
Avoid the snowballs.

7756
03:47:09,250 --> 03:47:09,510
Dude.

7757
03:47:09,770 --> 03:47:11,910
Where am I?

7758
03:47:12,090 --> 03:47:13,970
I'm sliding away.

7759
03:47:13,970 --> 03:47:15,210
Wait, I gotta take Sykkuno's technique.

7760
03:47:15,470 --> 03:47:16,910
Sykkuno's technique at the bottom.

7761
03:47:17,270 --> 03:47:18,810
I have to stay at the bottom.

7762
03:47:20,330 --> 03:47:23,770
Mathematically proven that if you stand in this corner that...

7763
03:47:23,770 --> 03:47:25,330
Wait, dude, I'm cheating.

7764
03:47:25,470 --> 03:47:26,370
Wait, there's two?

7765
03:47:26,730 --> 03:47:27,670
There's two now.

7766
03:47:27,790 --> 03:47:28,130
There's two.

7767
03:47:28,530 --> 03:47:29,050
No.

7768
03:47:29,970 --> 03:47:31,290
Oh, god.

7769
03:47:33,030 --> 03:47:34,430
Don't push me, bro.

7770
03:47:34,670 --> 03:47:36,430
Don't push me.

7771
03:47:36,430 --> 03:47:38,210
You pushed me.

7772
03:47:40,210 --> 03:47:41,170
No, yes.

7773
03:47:41,170 --> 03:47:41,990
Yes, yes.

7774
03:47:42,890 --> 03:47:43,750
Doki, die.

7775
03:47:44,090 --> 03:47:44,590
Doki.

7776
03:47:44,690 --> 03:47:45,670
Doki, you better win.

7777
03:47:45,790 --> 03:47:46,870
Doki, no.

7778
03:47:47,750 --> 03:47:48,690
Doki, yes.

7779
03:47:49,630 --> 03:47:51,530
Why are we getting all the bottom?

7780
03:47:52,590 --> 03:47:57,650
Because I made up a rumor that it's mathematically proven that going to the bottom is safer.

7781
03:47:58,250 --> 03:48:01,310
And I've won most of the time in the Mario Party version.

7782
03:48:01,490 --> 03:48:02,710
Holy crap, dude.

7783
03:48:03,130 --> 03:48:05,590
Yeah, yeah, but in the Roblox version, it's the opposite.

7784
03:48:05,910 --> 03:48:07,950
It's the other way around.

7785
03:48:08,230 --> 03:48:09,370
Holy Christ.

7786
03:48:11,170 --> 03:48:12,670
Dude, Elm, you're only seven away from the star.

7787
03:48:12,830 --> 03:48:13,570
Thank god for that.

7788
03:48:13,750 --> 03:48:15,970
Yeah, you can roll a seven.

7789
03:48:16,690 --> 03:48:18,550
Yeah, yeah, you have an inventory.

7790
03:48:19,090 --> 03:48:19,410
Boom.

7791
03:48:20,010 --> 03:48:20,330
No.

7792
03:48:21,610 --> 03:48:22,270
That's money, though.

7793
03:48:22,450 --> 03:48:22,890
That's money.

7794
03:48:23,310 --> 03:48:24,090
I mean, that's money.

7795
03:48:24,350 --> 03:48:25,190
Yeah, that's money, yeah.

7796
03:48:25,790 --> 03:48:27,510
You did just need a seven, though.

7797
03:48:30,470 --> 03:48:30,830
What's up?

7798
03:48:31,010 --> 03:48:31,630
What are you trying to do?

7799
03:48:31,630 --> 03:48:33,510
You went the wrong way.

7800
03:48:33,610 --> 03:48:34,510
Why'd you go that way?

7801
03:48:34,610 --> 03:48:35,470
Wait, this is the wrong way.

7802
03:48:35,610 --> 03:48:36,290
Am I being...

7803
03:48:37,110 --> 03:48:37,430
Yes.

7804
03:48:37,650 --> 03:48:37,970
Yes.

7805
03:48:38,290 --> 03:48:39,170
Yes, the crown.

7806
03:48:41,170 --> 03:48:41,690
Thank god for that.

7807
03:48:41,790 --> 03:48:42,810
Thank god for that.

7808
03:48:44,750 --> 03:48:46,770
As long as she doesn't roll an eight, I'm chilling.

7809
03:48:47,530 --> 03:48:49,630
Oh, it looks like the clam come back later.

7810
03:48:49,850 --> 03:48:51,650
Oh, boy.

7811
03:48:53,050 --> 03:48:53,850
Oh, boy.

7812
03:48:55,190 --> 03:48:57,690
As long as I roll high enough, I get this.

7813
03:48:58,250 --> 03:48:59,490
It'll be funny if you get a two.

7814
03:49:00,390 --> 03:49:01,610
What do I need, like a five?

7815
03:49:02,190 --> 03:49:03,790
You need, like, a three.

7816
03:49:04,650 --> 03:49:07,790
Oh, dude, if I get less than a three, I may as well ult that four now.

7817
03:49:09,550 --> 03:49:10,930
Oh, it doesn't matter.

7818
03:49:11,810 --> 03:49:13,370
No way, dude.

7819
03:49:13,370 --> 03:49:13,730
Oh, my god.

7820
03:49:13,730 --> 03:49:14,330
There ain't no way.

7821
03:49:14,810 --> 03:49:16,770
There ain't no shot, dude.

7822
03:49:16,870 --> 03:49:17,990
There ain't no way.

7823
03:49:19,310 --> 03:49:19,870
Beautiful.

7824
03:49:20,730 --> 03:49:22,490
There ain't no way.

7825
03:49:22,890 --> 03:49:26,010
If I wasn't last pick, that would've been the W right there.

7826
03:49:26,490 --> 03:49:27,610
Oh, my god.

7827
03:49:28,190 --> 03:49:30,150
Wait, this is kind of close.

7828
03:49:30,270 --> 03:49:31,190
This is kind of close.

7829
03:49:31,250 --> 03:49:31,630
That's crazy.

7830
03:49:32,710 --> 03:49:35,430
That's actually the unlucky.

7831
03:49:35,430 --> 03:49:38,630
Dude, the bad luck.

7832
03:49:38,750 --> 03:49:39,730
The bad luck.

7833
03:49:39,730 --> 03:49:40,870
The bad luck doesn't...

7834
03:49:40,870 --> 03:49:42,630
At least it's happening today instead of tomorrow.

7835
03:49:43,210 --> 03:49:44,150
The five coins.

7836
03:49:44,150 --> 03:49:46,390
I'm already, like, second to the bottom seed.

7837
03:49:48,150 --> 03:49:49,190
No way.

7838
03:49:49,310 --> 03:49:50,590
I wouldn't have made it anyway.

7839
03:49:51,030 --> 03:49:52,270
This is insanity.

7840
03:49:52,530 --> 03:49:53,090
You always made it.

7841
03:49:53,090 --> 03:49:54,290
Holy shit.

7842
03:49:55,230 --> 03:49:57,350
There ain't no shot, bro.

7843
03:49:57,570 --> 03:49:58,430
There actually ain't no way.

7844
03:49:58,630 --> 03:50:00,170
This is the worst luck ever.

7845
03:50:00,370 --> 03:50:01,150
Hole in the wall.

7846
03:50:01,210 --> 03:50:01,850
Hole in the wall.

7847
03:50:01,910 --> 03:50:02,830
Come on.

7848
03:50:02,830 --> 03:50:03,550
Give us a hole in the wall.

7849
03:50:03,570 --> 03:50:03,990
Please.

7850
03:50:05,430 --> 03:50:06,230
How would I...

7851
03:50:06,230 --> 03:50:08,450
Not Taco Tuesday again.

7852
03:50:09,290 --> 03:50:11,250
Ever since you mentioned it.

7853
03:50:11,410 --> 03:50:12,930
Dude, this one sucks.

7854
03:50:13,750 --> 03:50:14,890
This one sucks.

7855
03:50:15,130 --> 03:50:15,770
This is not a game.

7856
03:50:16,270 --> 03:50:17,430
Where am I?

7857
03:50:17,450 --> 03:50:18,970
This one's literally not a game.

7858
03:50:19,050 --> 03:50:19,790
I couldn't figure out...

7859
03:50:19,790 --> 03:50:20,350
You bopped me.

7860
03:50:20,510 --> 03:50:21,130
You bopped me.

7861
03:50:21,510 --> 03:50:22,250
Lock it in.

7862
03:50:22,310 --> 03:50:22,670
Lock it in.

7863
03:50:23,150 --> 03:50:24,750
Wait, you can bop each other?

7864
03:50:25,230 --> 03:50:26,070
I think so.

7865
03:50:26,390 --> 03:50:28,850
Dude, I'm using my two-hand technique.

7866
03:50:29,750 --> 03:50:31,890
What the fuck does that mean?

7867
03:50:32,890 --> 03:50:33,930
He's making...

7868
03:50:35,430 --> 03:50:36,810
Another hand for E.

7869
03:50:37,010 --> 03:50:37,430
Yeah.

7870
03:50:39,050 --> 03:50:40,470
Bro's min-maxing.

7871
03:50:40,470 --> 03:50:40,990
This is crazy.

7872
03:50:41,010 --> 03:50:42,790
He needs to win.

7873
03:50:43,870 --> 03:50:44,350
Look at my speed, though.

7874
03:50:44,350 --> 03:50:45,130
Look at that speed, though.

7875
03:50:46,250 --> 03:50:49,190
You laugh at the technique, but it's so good, though.

7876
03:50:49,390 --> 03:50:50,490
But we're almost tied.

7877
03:50:52,170 --> 03:50:53,130
We're tied.

7878
03:50:53,630 --> 03:50:54,930
No, that means we all lose.

7879
03:50:56,150 --> 03:50:57,110
Once again.

7880
03:50:57,110 --> 03:50:59,230
You know in Mario Party, when you all tie, everyone wins?

7881
03:50:59,470 --> 03:51:00,890
In this one, everyone loses.

7882
03:51:01,770 --> 03:51:03,110
Does no one...

7883
03:51:03,110 --> 03:51:04,870
Yeah, it just doesn't matter, bro.

7884
03:51:05,010 --> 03:51:07,490
What happened to the two-hand technique?

7885
03:51:08,390 --> 03:51:09,030
I mean, it is...

7886
03:51:09,030 --> 03:51:11,050
Honestly, there's only so much you can do.

7887
03:51:11,330 --> 03:51:13,310
Well, guys, I guess I gotta do this.

7888
03:51:13,810 --> 03:51:15,690
Are we taking my crown now?

7889
03:51:15,770 --> 03:51:16,630
Thank you so much.

7890
03:51:17,830 --> 03:51:18,710
I'm on the way.

7891
03:51:20,070 --> 03:51:20,910
Very good.

7892
03:51:21,090 --> 03:51:22,770
This map is small, actually, now that I look at it.

7893
03:51:22,950 --> 03:51:25,310
Give me my crown, please, for the love of God.

7894
03:51:26,150 --> 03:51:26,570
Roll.

7895
03:51:26,810 --> 03:51:27,870
He might win this game.

7896
03:51:28,010 --> 03:51:28,270
He might.

7897
03:51:28,530 --> 03:51:28,910
Bang.

7898
03:51:29,230 --> 03:51:30,150
A classic four.

7899
03:51:30,150 --> 03:51:32,170
I thought that one crown was zero mini-game wins.

7900
03:51:32,470 --> 03:51:32,650
Yes.

7901
03:51:32,650 --> 03:51:32,990
Yes.

7902
03:51:32,990 --> 03:51:33,610
That is true.

7903
03:51:33,810 --> 03:51:34,590
And we're so back.

7904
03:51:34,590 --> 03:51:35,950
We are so back right now.

7905
03:51:36,490 --> 03:51:37,630
Someone steal his crown.

7906
03:51:37,910 --> 03:51:38,370
No.

7907
03:51:38,510 --> 03:51:39,030
No.

7908
03:51:39,250 --> 03:51:39,670
No.

7909
03:51:41,290 --> 03:51:42,190
You're sick.

7910
03:51:42,350 --> 03:51:43,510
Wait, it's in front of me.

7911
03:51:43,630 --> 03:51:44,790
It's in front of me.

7912
03:51:44,790 --> 03:51:45,350
No way.

7913
03:51:45,410 --> 03:51:47,570
It's right in front of Hewn again.

7914
03:51:47,830 --> 03:51:48,950
Wait, really?

7915
03:51:49,130 --> 03:51:49,550
It's right in front of Hewn again.

7916
03:51:49,710 --> 03:51:52,610
It's in front of all of us.

7917
03:51:52,630 --> 03:51:53,710
Dude, this is crazy.

7918
03:51:54,770 --> 03:51:57,290
Guess who's in fourth place for rolls.

7919
03:51:57,590 --> 03:51:59,090
There's no way I get this.

7920
03:52:00,210 --> 03:52:01,190
Galaxy, I get this.

7921
03:52:01,330 --> 03:52:03,190
Wait, he's gonna use his dash block?

7922
03:52:03,230 --> 03:52:04,430
No, he's not.

7923
03:52:04,570 --> 03:52:05,090
No, I can't.

7924
03:52:05,170 --> 03:52:05,390
I can't.

7925
03:52:05,730 --> 03:52:07,150
Wait, Doki gets this right now.

7926
03:52:07,170 --> 03:52:07,750
Yeah, I get this.

7927
03:52:07,910 --> 03:52:08,150
Yeah.

7928
03:52:08,350 --> 03:52:10,610
No, Doki, why?

7929
03:52:10,930 --> 03:52:12,470
I have the most mini-games win.

7930
03:52:14,110 --> 03:52:14,990
It doesn't matter.

7931
03:52:15,450 --> 03:52:17,790
Well, maybe it'll spawn in front of me.

7932
03:52:17,930 --> 03:52:18,290
Yeah, yeah.

7933
03:52:18,310 --> 03:52:19,470
It could spawn in front of you.

7934
03:52:19,650 --> 03:52:20,410
What are the odds?

7935
03:52:20,770 --> 03:52:23,110
Like, it's gonna spawn in front of me.

7936
03:52:25,730 --> 03:52:26,390
There it is.

7937
03:52:26,470 --> 03:52:27,650
Right in front of nobody.

7938
03:52:28,690 --> 03:52:29,430
No, there it is.

7939
03:52:30,150 --> 03:52:30,410
Oh, that's great.

7940
03:52:30,530 --> 03:52:30,770
No, that's great.

7941
03:52:30,770 --> 03:52:31,570
Oh, it's so far.

7942
03:52:31,930 --> 03:52:32,850
Oh, god.

7943
03:52:32,970 --> 03:52:34,130
I mean, it's... Oh, wait.

7944
03:52:34,290 --> 03:52:35,870
Wait, so do you have a crown?

7945
03:52:37,010 --> 03:52:37,830
You have nothing.

7946
03:52:38,090 --> 03:52:39,230
All I have is the mini...

7947
03:52:39,230 --> 03:52:40,430
Wait, I don't know.

7948
03:52:40,510 --> 03:52:41,110
I'm going back up.

7949
03:52:42,430 --> 03:52:43,310
Wait, how do I...

7950
03:52:43,310 --> 03:52:44,110
You suck on the rope?

7951
03:52:45,030 --> 03:52:45,470
What the...

7952
03:52:47,410 --> 03:52:48,610
What the fuck happened?

7953
03:52:49,350 --> 03:52:50,410
This is cucked.

7954
03:52:50,410 --> 03:52:51,250
This is actually cucked.

7955
03:52:51,890 --> 03:52:53,050
I blinked for a second.

7956
03:52:53,250 --> 03:52:54,490
It's actually cucked, bro.

7957
03:52:54,510 --> 03:52:56,050
Dude, she's hacking.

7958
03:52:56,050 --> 03:52:57,530
And she rolls again.

7959
03:52:57,670 --> 03:52:59,010
Wait, Doki, I swear to god.

7960
03:52:59,430 --> 03:53:01,390
Wait, she can steal a star.

7961
03:53:01,570 --> 03:53:02,910
Dude, she can steal a crown.

7962
03:53:03,350 --> 03:53:04,330
Oh my god, she didn't.

7963
03:53:04,350 --> 03:53:04,770
She didn't.

7964
03:53:05,410 --> 03:53:07,310
Dude, no way she steals a crown though, right?

7965
03:53:07,870 --> 03:53:08,270
Doki!

7966
03:53:10,850 --> 03:53:11,650
Yeah, yeah.

7967
03:53:11,830 --> 03:53:12,570
That's the move.

7968
03:53:13,390 --> 03:53:14,230
That's the move.

7969
03:53:14,230 --> 03:53:15,570
Now Elem has no money.

7970
03:53:15,570 --> 03:53:16,570
No crowns.

7971
03:53:16,570 --> 03:53:16,970
No nothing.

7972
03:53:17,210 --> 03:53:18,430
Wait, you have two crowns?

7973
03:53:18,910 --> 03:53:20,490
How the heck in the heck?

7974
03:53:21,670 --> 03:53:22,810
Dude, Elem, that's so sad.

7975
03:53:23,430 --> 03:53:25,690
Dude, that was my first fucking crown.

7976
03:53:27,690 --> 03:53:28,130
Dude, that was my first fucking crown.

7977
03:53:28,130 --> 03:53:29,830
Okay, as long as I don't get last, I'm chilling.

7978
03:53:30,110 --> 03:53:30,550
Okay, as long as I don't get last, I'm chilling.

7979
03:53:30,550 --> 03:53:31,650
As long as I don't get last, I'm chilling.

7980
03:53:31,830 --> 03:53:32,770
Is that a golden?

7981
03:53:33,210 --> 03:53:34,150
That wasn't a golden.

7982
03:53:34,150 --> 03:53:34,610
No, that's not.

7983
03:53:34,770 --> 03:53:36,290
If it was, I would have used it.

7984
03:53:37,010 --> 03:53:39,230
Dude, if that's a golden teleporter, it's GG.

7985
03:53:39,810 --> 03:53:40,370
Oh, Jesus Christ!

7986
03:53:40,370 --> 03:53:43,030
I got the money though, unless I win the minigame.

7987
03:53:44,230 --> 03:53:44,670
Oh, Jesus Christ!

7988
03:53:44,670 --> 03:53:47,290
Technically, Sekiro could steal the crown as well.

7989
03:53:47,590 --> 03:53:47,630
Technically, Sekiro could steal the crown as well.

7990
03:53:47,970 --> 03:53:50,410
I don't plan on it, I don't plan on it.

7991
03:53:50,550 --> 03:53:51,270
I mean...

7992
03:53:56,750 --> 03:53:58,610
Well, I don't have the money, do I?

7993
03:53:59,030 --> 03:54:00,530
You just need...

7994
03:54:01,150 --> 03:54:02,550
Hewn, you wouldn't, right?

7995
03:54:03,030 --> 03:54:04,210
Hewn, you wouldn't, right?

7996
03:54:04,890 --> 03:54:07,310
Oh, wait, look at what I can do.

7997
03:54:07,610 --> 03:54:08,470
Hewn, you wouldn't, right?

7998
03:54:08,630 --> 03:54:11,610
Wait, if you steal money from Sykkuno, he can't afford to steal a crown.

7999
03:54:14,750 --> 03:54:16,430
I'm pressing random, I'm pressing random.

8000
03:54:16,670 --> 03:54:18,690
No, show your pressing random right there!

8001
03:54:19,710 --> 03:54:20,910
No, I swear!

8002
03:54:20,910 --> 03:54:21,230
I swear!

8003
03:54:21,230 --> 03:54:25,090
I swear on my life, it was random.

8004
03:54:25,290 --> 03:54:26,950
I swear on my life, it was random.

8005
03:54:26,950 --> 03:54:28,470
I swear on my life, it was random.

8006
03:54:28,830 --> 03:54:29,350
Remember that.

8007
03:54:29,350 --> 03:54:30,490
This is how you've been repaid.

8008
03:54:31,650 --> 03:54:33,490
That's actually crazy!

8009
03:54:34,970 --> 03:54:37,910
Dude, and she just lost the coins you just paid for her.

8010
03:54:39,170 --> 03:54:40,470
Oh, thank you.

8011
03:54:40,510 --> 03:54:41,310
It's a net...

8012
03:54:43,190 --> 03:54:44,230
Back of coins!

8013
03:54:45,030 --> 03:54:46,330
Hey, you got your coins!

8014
03:54:46,670 --> 03:54:48,110
You can afford the crown.

8015
03:54:49,810 --> 03:54:50,710
Okay, we got a few coins.

8016
03:54:51,650 --> 03:54:52,590
Dude, I ain't going for a steal.

8017
03:54:52,690 --> 03:54:53,310
I'm going for the crown.

8018
03:54:54,210 --> 03:54:58,030
I think Doki's about to win though, like a crown or a couple minigames.

8019
03:54:58,030 --> 03:55:00,750
No, I need like two, I need like three minigames.

8020
03:55:00,770 --> 03:55:02,310
Yeah, three minigames maybe, yeah.

8021
03:55:02,650 --> 03:55:03,110
Yeah, yeah.

8022
03:55:03,230 --> 03:55:04,150
Maybe two, I don't know.

8023
03:55:04,310 --> 03:55:06,050
Wait, Blackout, wait.

8024
03:55:06,210 --> 03:55:07,570
Are they going to explain how to play this game?

8025
03:55:08,490 --> 03:55:10,630
There's gonna be like text at the very top.

8026
03:55:10,910 --> 03:55:13,690
It's that crab game where you gotta like run, and you gotta like get the cubes.

8027
03:55:14,070 --> 03:55:16,430
So whoever red and blue is, we gotta get them.

8028
03:55:17,270 --> 03:55:18,010
Oh, all of it?

8029
03:55:18,090 --> 03:55:18,750
Oh, okay.

8030
03:55:18,750 --> 03:55:19,030
Okay.

8031
03:55:20,010 --> 03:55:20,970
I see now.

8032
03:55:22,950 --> 03:55:23,830
Okay, okay, okay.

8033
03:55:24,150 --> 03:55:24,730
I'm gonna follow.

8034
03:55:28,170 --> 03:55:30,190
This game is dankest, man.

8035
03:55:30,310 --> 03:55:32,150
This is like that Fall Guys game.

8036
03:55:32,390 --> 03:55:33,790
This game is kind of nice though.

8037
03:55:34,730 --> 03:55:35,350
This is that Fall Guys game.

8038
03:55:35,350 --> 03:55:36,770
Oh, the music's kind of picking up though.

8039
03:55:38,230 --> 03:55:40,690
Don't even lie, the music's kind of picking it up a little bit.

8040
03:55:42,490 --> 03:55:42,890
Dude!

8041
03:55:42,910 --> 03:55:43,710
Nice try, LM.

8042
03:55:43,750 --> 03:55:44,650
I see what you're doing.

8043
03:55:46,310 --> 03:55:48,530
Dude, the music is picking up a little bit.

8044
03:55:48,590 --> 03:55:48,730
Dude, the music is picking up a little bit.

8045
03:55:48,750 --> 03:55:48,810
Stop!

8046
03:55:49,290 --> 03:55:49,730
Stop!

8047
03:55:51,030 --> 03:55:52,650
Give me back my squares.

8048
03:55:53,570 --> 03:55:54,930
Give these back to me.

8049
03:55:54,950 --> 03:55:56,850
I got a strat going on.

8050
03:55:56,850 --> 03:55:57,290
Hold up.

8051
03:55:57,350 --> 03:55:58,610
Wait a second, she's dialed in.

8052
03:55:59,810 --> 03:56:01,850
Oh my god, wait, I don't even know who's on my team.

8053
03:56:01,850 --> 03:56:03,610
Bro, it's unfair to you, she's got large feet.

8054
03:56:03,910 --> 03:56:05,870
She's got more surface area.

8055
03:56:06,210 --> 03:56:07,590
This is ridiculous.

8056
03:56:08,150 --> 03:56:08,610
Her feet!

8057
03:56:08,850 --> 03:56:10,070
Her feet are too cracked.

8058
03:56:11,250 --> 03:56:12,770
It makes no sense.

8059
03:56:14,810 --> 03:56:15,770
Who won?

8060
03:56:15,850 --> 03:56:17,010
We crushed it.

8061
03:56:18,750 --> 03:56:19,670
Dude, who was my partner?

8062
03:56:20,470 --> 03:56:21,130
They got like nothing.

8063
03:56:22,450 --> 03:56:25,190
Dude, I was going, I was going.

8064
03:56:25,390 --> 03:56:25,990
What happened?

8065
03:56:26,130 --> 03:56:28,410
I was going, trust me.

8066
03:56:28,410 --> 03:56:29,290
I had so many.

8067
03:56:29,450 --> 03:56:32,970
I had a lot too, but LM was just following me.

8068
03:56:32,990 --> 03:56:35,790
I was following Doki and then LM started following me.

8069
03:56:35,790 --> 03:56:36,130
I'm sorry, guys.

8070
03:56:36,470 --> 03:56:36,870
I'm sorry.

8071
03:56:39,270 --> 03:56:40,650
Now LM's going to win.

8072
03:56:40,710 --> 03:56:41,730
We gotta gang up on him again.

8073
03:56:43,110 --> 03:56:48,370
No matter how many games LM's gonna win, or will win, he will never win.

8074
03:56:49,290 --> 03:56:51,070
He'll never get a crown.

8075
03:56:51,530 --> 03:56:51,930
I will.

8076
03:56:52,170 --> 03:56:52,930
I'm gonna get a crown.

8077
03:56:53,490 --> 03:56:55,050
Wait, you didn't go for the crown?

8078
03:56:55,310 --> 03:56:56,750
That's actually crazy that you didn't.

8079
03:56:56,910 --> 03:56:58,650
No, I thought I was gonna get a crown warp.

8080
03:56:58,770 --> 03:56:59,950
I thought I was gonna get a crown warp.

8081
03:57:01,190 --> 03:57:04,510
I was praying for that, but it didn't work, bro.

8082
03:57:04,690 --> 03:57:05,510
It didn't work.

8083
03:57:06,290 --> 03:57:07,430
That's so fucked.

8084
03:57:09,270 --> 03:57:09,710
Bro.

8085
03:57:09,910 --> 03:57:13,830
No matter what's gonna happen, he was never gonna get a crown.

8086
03:57:17,850 --> 03:57:18,730
This is so stupid.

8087
03:57:20,450 --> 03:57:24,790
Dude, how is anyone going to beat Doki in this situation?

8088
03:57:24,850 --> 03:57:24,870
Dude, how is anyone going to beat Doki in this situation?

8089
03:57:24,870 --> 03:57:25,910
That's what I'm saying, bro.

8090
03:57:26,490 --> 03:57:27,710
He's too cracked.

8091
03:57:28,150 --> 03:57:29,650
Wait, am I actually right by the crown?

8092
03:57:29,970 --> 03:57:31,370
You're literally right by the crown.

8093
03:57:31,770 --> 03:57:34,150
I think you need to roll like a seven or something.

8094
03:57:34,510 --> 03:57:35,470
He's too cracked.

8095
03:57:36,510 --> 03:57:38,790
Dude, how did we lose so badly last game?

8096
03:57:38,810 --> 03:57:39,670
It was like 59.

8097
03:57:40,270 --> 03:57:41,570
That's what I'm saying.

8098
03:57:41,870 --> 03:57:43,750
What did we do wrong?

8099
03:57:43,750 --> 03:57:47,350
Because you guys forgot that there were squares at the top, too.

8100
03:57:47,450 --> 03:57:47,850
Because you guys forgot that there were squares at the top, too.

8101
03:57:48,730 --> 03:57:50,150
I went for a few of those, bro.

8102
03:57:50,310 --> 03:57:51,090
Yeah, I went for...

8103
03:57:51,090 --> 03:57:53,710
Nobody took the top squares.

8104
03:57:54,330 --> 03:57:55,850
So my top squares were...

8105
03:57:55,850 --> 03:57:57,290
Wait, why aren't you going for the crown?

8106
03:57:58,170 --> 03:57:58,690
Oh, wait.

8107
03:58:01,090 --> 03:58:03,930
You can warp Doki out right now.

8108
03:58:04,130 --> 03:58:04,250
You can warp Doki out right now.

8109
03:58:04,250 --> 03:58:05,650
Wait, is Doki about to...

8110
03:58:06,150 --> 03:58:08,350
Yeah, they're gonna win if you don't.

8111
03:58:09,830 --> 03:58:10,950
Doki, Doki, Doki.

8112
03:58:10,950 --> 03:58:11,730
You're gonna warp me?

8113
03:58:12,130 --> 03:58:14,710
No, you should warp to Sakuro.

8114
03:58:14,830 --> 03:58:16,470
He's even closer than me.

8115
03:58:18,510 --> 03:58:19,950
He's even closer.

8116
03:58:22,070 --> 03:58:22,510
See?

8117
03:58:22,730 --> 03:58:23,170
See?

8118
03:58:23,290 --> 03:58:24,690
He's really close.

8119
03:58:24,830 --> 03:58:26,290
Please tell him you warp me and we lose.

8120
03:58:26,590 --> 03:58:27,910
You warp me and we lose, man.

8121
03:58:28,810 --> 03:58:30,570
You know this to be true.

8122
03:58:30,670 --> 03:58:31,710
What are you gonna do?

8123
03:58:31,750 --> 03:58:32,130
What are you gonna buy?

8124
03:58:32,210 --> 03:58:33,770
You bought a crown warp?

8125
03:58:34,890 --> 03:58:35,610
Yeah, why not?

8126
03:58:36,270 --> 03:58:37,690
That worries me, man.

8127
03:58:37,790 --> 03:58:39,350
It worries me.

8128
03:58:39,450 --> 03:58:44,410
All I'm saying is if you warp him, he'll be forced to use his crown warp.

8129
03:58:44,850 --> 03:58:45,290
Shit.

8130
03:58:46,470 --> 03:58:47,670
I actually timed this perfectly.

8131
03:58:47,950 --> 03:58:49,710
Oh, he gazed it!

8132
03:58:49,950 --> 03:58:55,750
Because I get one coin every time I move, and I was able to buy it and the crown warp.

8133
03:58:55,750 --> 03:58:56,870
He just got it, yeah.

8134
03:58:57,690 --> 03:58:59,330
Dude, that's insane.

8135
03:58:59,510 --> 03:59:02,910
I made it to the crown, plus I got one coin every roll, which means...

8136
03:59:04,050 --> 03:59:04,930
He can...

8137
03:59:04,930 --> 03:59:07,250
Wait, dude, who's that next to?

8138
03:59:08,110 --> 03:59:08,930
Who's that next to?

8139
03:59:10,690 --> 03:59:11,990
Wait, is that Doki?

8140
03:59:12,290 --> 03:59:13,230
It's near Doki.

8141
03:59:14,070 --> 03:59:15,230
Yeah, no, I don't...

8142
03:59:15,230 --> 03:59:15,870
I can't get there.

8143
03:59:15,990 --> 03:59:18,150
I can't get there.

8144
03:59:18,270 --> 03:59:19,470
No way, it's near me.

8145
03:59:19,850 --> 03:59:20,770
Dude, what?

8146
03:59:21,170 --> 03:59:23,550
The crown moves what a...

8147
03:59:24,610 --> 03:59:27,370
Wait, receive one thousand coins.

8148
03:59:27,510 --> 03:59:28,110
You just lost ten coins, dude.

8149
03:59:28,650 --> 03:59:30,290
You're one coin, oh my god.

8150
03:59:32,490 --> 03:59:33,350
You're one coin.

8151
03:59:34,470 --> 03:59:35,730
Give us a new one.

8152
03:59:35,790 --> 03:59:36,250
Give us a new one.

8153
03:59:36,390 --> 03:59:37,350
Give us a juicy one.

8154
03:59:39,270 --> 03:59:40,550
Oh yeah, oh yeah.

8155
03:59:40,550 --> 03:59:42,970
This one, this one's dumb.

8156
03:59:42,970 --> 03:59:44,330
Here we go, guys.

8157
03:59:44,450 --> 03:59:45,670
Give me what I need.

8158
03:59:45,770 --> 03:59:47,070
Give me what I need here.

8159
03:59:48,170 --> 03:59:48,890
Oh yeah.

8160
03:59:49,010 --> 03:59:50,730
Oh god, I almost stepped on the...

8161
03:59:51,510 --> 03:59:52,710
Stop pushing me.

8162
03:59:52,830 --> 03:59:54,490
I think it still kills you like that.

8163
03:59:54,910 --> 03:59:56,290
Sykes, you're pushing me.

8164
03:59:56,710 --> 03:59:59,070
Syke, you killed me.

8165
03:59:59,410 --> 04:00:00,410
I'm not even there.

8166
04:00:01,330 --> 04:00:04,070
What was he yelling out?

8167
04:00:04,130 --> 04:00:04,690
Syke.

8168
04:00:05,050 --> 04:00:08,210
I literally did not...

8169
04:00:08,210 --> 04:00:10,530
Use your large hands and push me.

8170
04:00:10,550 --> 04:00:11,170
Push me under the stove.

8171
04:00:11,210 --> 04:00:11,630
What do you mean?

8172
04:00:11,710 --> 04:00:13,310
I'm sorry, what can I do?

8173
04:00:13,450 --> 04:00:14,850
I was born with these feet.

8174
04:00:16,970 --> 04:00:18,830
She actually killed me.

8175
04:00:18,870 --> 04:00:20,270
I landed on her head.

8176
04:00:20,570 --> 04:00:22,730
And then she pushed me.

8177
04:00:22,810 --> 04:00:23,730
She's gonna win, guys.

8178
04:00:24,390 --> 04:00:26,490
Guys, she's literally about to win.

8179
04:00:26,670 --> 04:00:27,350
I didn't do anything.

8180
04:00:27,770 --> 04:00:30,030
I didn't do anything.

8181
04:00:31,470 --> 04:00:33,230
You jumped on my head.

8182
04:00:33,310 --> 04:00:34,810
What was I supposed to do?

8183
04:00:35,370 --> 04:00:36,730
Bro, where is the crown?

8184
04:00:37,150 --> 04:00:37,690
Oh my god, dude.

8185
04:00:38,770 --> 04:00:39,390
That's crazy.

8186
04:00:40,550 --> 04:00:40,930
What is this thing?

8187
04:00:41,850 --> 04:00:42,850
It's on the other side.

8188
04:00:42,850 --> 04:00:43,910
Is it five away?

8189
04:00:44,990 --> 04:00:45,790
Yeah, you're five away.

8190
04:00:47,690 --> 04:00:49,550
Here we go, here we go.

8191
04:00:49,730 --> 04:00:50,490
Come on, please.

8192
04:00:52,650 --> 04:00:53,850
Five to an eight.

8193
04:00:54,030 --> 04:00:55,510
Oh, thank Christ.

8194
04:00:55,910 --> 04:00:57,130
I think he gets it.

8195
04:00:57,350 --> 04:00:58,450
Oh my god, thank Christ.

8196
04:00:59,990 --> 04:01:00,430
Boom.

8197
04:01:01,350 --> 04:01:02,930
Yes, finally I get a crown.

8198
04:01:03,230 --> 04:01:04,670
Finally I get a crown.

8199
04:01:04,810 --> 04:01:05,950
Oh my god, hallelujah.

8200
04:01:06,670 --> 04:01:07,450
There it is.

8201
04:01:07,450 --> 04:01:08,330
That's what I always needed.

8202
04:01:08,330 --> 04:01:10,470
Just one more crown to add to my collection.

8203
04:01:11,110 --> 04:01:12,890
Oh my lord, yes, yes.

8204
04:01:13,570 --> 04:01:17,870
Okay, well this game could go to anybody if you take Doki out of the picture.

8205
04:01:18,750 --> 04:01:19,650
What did I just do?

8206
04:01:20,490 --> 04:01:21,190
That's true.

8207
04:01:21,410 --> 04:01:23,150
Or well, you're just so far ahead.

8208
04:01:23,250 --> 04:01:24,410
I loop back around again.

8209
04:01:25,130 --> 04:01:26,610
I loop around again.

8210
04:01:27,350 --> 04:01:29,110
I mean, they have no coins.

8211
04:01:30,550 --> 04:01:31,690
Yeah, I'm broke as hell.

8212
04:01:31,710 --> 04:01:32,870
I have three coins right now.

8213
04:01:33,610 --> 04:01:35,690
Wait, Doki's almost to the next crown.

8214
04:01:35,690 --> 04:01:36,650
She's 18 away.

8215
04:01:36,770 --> 04:01:38,690
I literally have three freaking coins right now.

8216
04:01:38,850 --> 04:01:39,350
Let's see.

8217
04:01:40,450 --> 04:01:42,710
Oh, there's no gold crown.

8218
04:01:43,390 --> 04:01:45,870
Oh, is it because I bought it?

8219
04:01:45,970 --> 04:01:47,370
Yeah, you bought it.

8220
04:01:48,090 --> 04:01:50,230
Yeah, only the first person who goes can buy it.

8221
04:01:51,430 --> 04:01:52,090
Not close.

8222
04:01:52,890 --> 04:01:54,050
I'm almost there.

8223
04:01:56,070 --> 04:01:56,810
Keep going.

8224
04:01:56,950 --> 04:01:59,090
Wait, how close is the shop?

8225
04:01:59,670 --> 04:02:00,690
Wait, you could buy a crown.

8226
04:02:00,730 --> 04:02:02,230
Dude, you're so rich.

8227
04:02:02,230 --> 04:02:04,070
There's no crown.

8228
04:02:05,390 --> 04:02:06,850
No, I'll buy this though.

8229
04:02:07,010 --> 04:02:07,950
That's only five dollars.

8230
04:02:08,430 --> 04:02:09,750
Wait, what's a golden block?

8231
04:02:09,930 --> 04:02:11,230
Is that like the dash block?

8232
04:02:11,430 --> 04:02:13,290
Yeah, more numbers.

8233
04:02:13,610 --> 04:02:14,010
Oh.

8234
04:02:15,950 --> 04:02:17,430
Alright, plus three.

8235
04:02:19,490 --> 04:02:20,250
Okay, okay.

8236
04:02:20,330 --> 04:02:22,250
But Sykkuno has the crown warp.

8237
04:02:22,990 --> 04:02:23,890
He does?

8238
04:02:24,610 --> 04:02:26,130
Oh yeah, you have the money.

8239
04:02:26,130 --> 04:02:26,550
Yeah.

8240
04:02:28,550 --> 04:02:29,110
Cute.

8241
04:02:32,230 --> 04:02:32,810
Where's my item though?

8242
04:02:34,610 --> 04:02:35,590
You have the...

8243
04:02:36,310 --> 04:02:37,530
Wait, what did you have?

8244
04:02:37,570 --> 04:02:40,910
No, I just had a custom dash block.

8245
04:02:41,030 --> 04:02:41,450
Oh, okay.

8246
04:02:42,530 --> 04:02:43,830
And you go to the shop as well.

8247
04:02:44,390 --> 04:02:45,150
That's huge.

8248
04:02:45,450 --> 04:02:46,610
Is there a crown there?

8249
04:02:47,690 --> 04:02:48,790
There's a crown warp.

8250
04:02:49,310 --> 04:02:50,330
Oh my god.

8251
04:02:50,510 --> 04:02:52,330
You could buy that and get a crown.

8252
04:02:53,230 --> 04:02:55,470
This one would be more fun.

8253
04:02:55,630 --> 04:02:57,110
There's a player warp as well, man.

8254
04:02:59,770 --> 04:03:00,810
Okay, okay.

8255
04:03:02,230 --> 04:03:03,030
What was that sound?

8256
04:03:03,230 --> 04:03:03,830
Good luck, guys.

8257
04:03:05,870 --> 04:03:06,850
Receive a crown.

8258
04:03:07,530 --> 04:03:08,390
What the?

8259
04:03:09,430 --> 04:03:13,870
How is that a thing in this game?

8260
04:03:14,230 --> 04:03:16,190
That doesn't make any sense.

8261
04:03:17,910 --> 04:03:20,170
Like, how is that a thing in this game?

8262
04:03:20,230 --> 04:03:20,650
Oh my god.

8263
04:03:21,230 --> 04:03:22,410
Where's the skill?

8264
04:03:22,830 --> 04:03:26,770
This is a Roblox Mario Party.

8265
04:03:26,790 --> 04:03:28,230
What do you mean by skill?

8266
04:03:28,230 --> 04:03:30,610
Dude, even Mario parties are full of stuff like that.

8267
04:03:30,610 --> 04:03:31,890
That is absolutely cooked, bro.

8268
04:03:31,890 --> 04:03:33,510
Dude, Mario Party doesn't even pull stuff like that.

8269
04:03:33,590 --> 04:03:34,110
That's crazy.

8270
04:03:35,350 --> 04:03:36,790
Holy crap, bro.

8271
04:03:37,650 --> 04:03:39,150
That's actually insane.

8272
04:03:39,310 --> 04:03:40,210
That is insane.

8273
04:03:42,050 --> 04:03:44,290
Is Yoon gonna get the two free?

8274
04:03:44,590 --> 04:03:46,470
The two wins in a row?

8275
04:03:46,730 --> 04:03:47,870
Surely not, right?

8276
04:03:47,970 --> 04:03:48,650
She's the goat.

8277
04:03:48,730 --> 04:03:49,970
She's the goat of Roblox party.

8278
04:03:50,250 --> 04:03:51,170
The two for two.

8279
04:03:51,290 --> 04:03:52,350
Two for two.

8280
04:03:54,150 --> 04:03:55,690
What the fuck is cheese cheese?

8281
04:03:56,050 --> 04:03:57,030
Give me a hole in the wall.

8282
04:03:59,990 --> 04:04:01,510
I guess we're gonna find out.

8283
04:04:01,910 --> 04:04:03,430
Another game we don't know.

8284
04:04:03,430 --> 04:04:04,250
It looks kinda cute though.

8285
04:04:04,450 --> 04:04:08,670
I'm assuming you gotta go through and not fall through the holes.

8286
04:04:09,290 --> 04:04:09,830
I'm assuming you gotta go through and not fall through the holes.

8287
04:04:09,830 --> 04:04:09,850
I'm assuming you gotta go through and not fall through the holes.

8288
04:04:09,850 --> 04:04:10,410
Yeah, oh.

8289
04:04:10,970 --> 04:04:12,370
Oh yeah, dude, that's easy.

8290
04:04:12,610 --> 04:04:14,130
Oh, you're just running through.

8291
04:04:14,510 --> 04:04:16,030
Dude, how do you die in this?

8292
04:04:16,210 --> 04:04:17,450
You don't.

8293
04:04:17,810 --> 04:04:20,670
Maybe if your feet are too big?

8294
04:04:21,830 --> 04:04:23,370
That's how Ellen loses it.

8295
04:04:23,950 --> 04:04:26,290
Dude ran it down her wrist.

8296
04:04:26,290 --> 04:04:26,670
Dude ran it down her wrist.

8297
04:04:27,030 --> 04:04:27,190
Yeah.

8298
04:04:27,890 --> 04:04:30,070
He had so much time.

8299
04:04:30,650 --> 04:04:32,710
I thought you had to jump up.

8300
04:04:32,850 --> 04:04:34,230
I thought there was a finish line.

8301
04:04:34,590 --> 04:04:37,070
I thought there was a finish line, bro.

8302
04:04:37,190 --> 04:04:37,930
What the frick?

8303
04:04:38,930 --> 04:04:40,730
Why did you go through the hole?

8304
04:04:41,310 --> 04:04:42,470
Wait, we all win.

8305
04:04:42,830 --> 04:04:43,570
Do we all win?

8306
04:04:44,430 --> 04:04:46,590
Wait, doesn't that mean Doki just wins?

8307
04:04:47,910 --> 04:04:49,010
Yeah, Doki wins.

8308
04:04:50,730 --> 04:04:51,770
Doki just wins?

8309
04:04:52,910 --> 04:04:56,030
Dude, how are we gonna stop her in that game?

8310
04:04:56,090 --> 04:04:56,890
I don't know.

8311
04:04:58,390 --> 04:04:59,450
She's too strong.

8312
04:04:59,490 --> 04:05:01,170
She's too strong, bro.

8313
04:05:01,250 --> 04:05:01,730
Let's go.

8314
04:05:02,390 --> 04:05:03,090
Let's go.

8315
04:05:03,310 --> 04:05:07,690
Get ready for my coaching session.

8316
04:05:07,910 --> 04:05:09,690
Alright, good luck with your coaching session.

8317
04:05:10,230 --> 04:05:10,710
See you guys later.

8318
04:05:10,890 --> 04:05:11,770
Peace to the games, guys.

8319
04:05:12,790 --> 04:05:13,430
GG's, everybody.

8320
04:05:13,910 --> 04:05:14,350
Bye.

8321
04:05:17,350 --> 04:05:18,490
Oh my gosh.

8322
04:05:18,530 --> 04:05:19,350
That was fun, dude.

8323
04:05:20,210 --> 04:05:21,570
That was actually really fun.

8324
04:05:22,070 --> 04:05:23,990
Honestly, god, I'm gonna be surreal.

8325
04:05:24,290 --> 04:05:25,710
Roblox is just a good game.

8326
04:05:27,030 --> 04:05:29,070
I don't wanna be the day where I genuinely mean that and actually say it.

8327
04:05:29,150 --> 04:05:29,550
But like...

8328
04:05:29,550 --> 04:05:31,750
I actually really fuck with that game.

8329
04:05:31,890 --> 04:05:32,990
Like, it's really... dude, it's good.

8330
04:05:33,190 --> 04:05:33,790
Like, it just is.

8331
04:05:35,750 --> 04:05:37,230
Like, it's actually just good.

8332
04:05:39,090 --> 04:05:39,890
Like, it's...

8333
04:05:44,210 --> 04:05:44,610
Um...

8334
04:05:48,050 --> 04:05:48,930
Dude, it was...

8335
04:05:48,930 --> 04:05:49,450
It was good.

8336
04:05:50,530 --> 04:05:52,270
Also, bro, I...

8337
04:05:52,270 --> 04:05:53,010
I'm gonna say it.

8338
04:05:53,090 --> 04:05:54,350
I fucking love that lobby.

8339
04:05:55,950 --> 04:05:56,350
Chat.

8340
04:05:56,670 --> 04:05:59,290
I loved that lobby.

8341
04:06:00,270 --> 04:06:01,370
I loved that lobby.

8342
04:06:02,030 --> 04:06:03,310
Like, that was a really...

8343
04:06:03,310 --> 04:06:05,110
That was a really, really fun couple of games.

8344
04:06:05,910 --> 04:06:07,570
I fucked with that hard, bro.

8345
04:06:07,610 --> 04:06:08,470
That was really good.

8346
04:06:09,810 --> 04:06:10,490
Dude, it was.

8347
04:06:10,570 --> 04:06:10,970
It was just...

8348
04:06:10,970 --> 04:06:11,670
It was just good vibes.

8349
04:06:12,630 --> 04:06:13,410
It was good vibes.

8350
04:06:13,810 --> 04:06:16,790
I think we're gonna try and do Dale and Dawson on Monday.

8351
04:06:16,890 --> 04:06:18,130
I think I'm gonna also try and do Mario Party.

8352
04:06:18,550 --> 04:06:21,250
I'm gonna invite Doki to the Dale and Dawson lobby.

8353
04:06:21,410 --> 04:06:24,430
And I think I'll try and run back the exact same squad for Mario Party.

8354
04:06:25,010 --> 04:06:25,530
And I think I'll try and run back the exact same squad for Mario Party.

8355
04:06:25,530 --> 04:06:26,590
So it's after Dale and Dawson.

8356
04:06:27,810 --> 04:06:28,590
Dude, I wanna...

8357
04:06:28,590 --> 04:06:30,850
I definitely... I wanna... I wanna invite Doki to more things, 100%.

8358
04:06:30,850 --> 04:06:32,090
Dude, she's great.

8359
04:06:32,550 --> 04:06:33,350
I love her.

8360
04:06:34,930 --> 04:06:36,690
Like, it's the same thing I said before the chat with, like, Hyun.

8361
04:06:36,750 --> 04:06:38,170
Like, just... I just love...

8362
04:06:38,170 --> 04:06:40,790
Like, people with, like, good energy, I still don't like to invite them and stuff, you know?

8363
04:06:41,630 --> 04:06:42,990
Dude, that was really fun.

8364
04:06:44,750 --> 04:06:45,910
Dude, that was insane.

8365
04:06:46,970 --> 04:06:48,050
Yeah, no, 100%.

8366
04:06:48,050 --> 04:06:49,130
We invite... We invite Doki.

8367
04:06:49,290 --> 04:06:50,510
Dude, I love Doki.

8368
04:06:51,490 --> 04:06:53,450
That was really... Dude, she's got, like, a...

8369
04:06:53,450 --> 04:06:55,070
She's got great fucking energy.

8370
04:06:56,630 --> 04:06:57,790
Great fucking energy, dude.

8371
04:06:57,890 --> 04:07:00,070
Like, high-key fuck with her energy.

8372
04:07:00,870 --> 04:07:02,770
Like, high-key, high-key, high-key fuck with her energy.

8373
04:07:03,870 --> 04:07:04,690
Bruh, that was...

8374
04:07:04,990 --> 04:07:05,290
Great.
