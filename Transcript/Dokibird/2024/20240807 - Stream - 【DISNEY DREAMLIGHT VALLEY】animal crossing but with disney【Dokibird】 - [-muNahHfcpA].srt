1
00:00:01,540 --> 00:00:02,820
Oh,

2
00:01:57,890 --> 00:01:58,430
hello!

3
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:03,570
My audio thing reset itself!

4
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:04,590
Damn!

5
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:08,560
So unlucky!

6
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:11,900
What happened to my overlay?

7
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,940
Oh my god!

8
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:22,880
Why is the chat overlay white?!

9
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,140
I'm so fucking unlucky.

10
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:29,220
Give me a sec, I gotta figure this out.

11
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:31,400
What's going on?!

12
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:34,440
Why is my CSS not working?!

13
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:39,160
Why is it not working?!

14
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,940
I am not...

15
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:44,140
Like, it hates me...

16
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:50,220
Oh my god, I don't even know what the overlay is!

17
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:54,380
What happened?!

18
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:56,790
Is...

19
00:02:56,790 --> 00:03:00,130
Oh, everyone's CSS... Oh my god!

20
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:07,390
Why is life like this?

21
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:08,910
Why?!

22
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:11,610
Okay.

23
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:18,570
Is it for everybody or is it just me?

24
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:20,270
I just... That's all I need to know.

25
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:21,610
Please, tell me.

26
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:26,130
Is it for everybody or is it just me right now?

27
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:29,530
Do any other VTubers have this issue?

28
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:32,030
It's just me?!

29
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:32,830
Oh, everybody.

30
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:33,770
Oh, thank god.

31
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:36,570
As long as everybody else suffers, that's fine with me.

32
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:37,870
I'm okay.

33
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:43,590
As long as everybody else is suffering and having a bad day, then I'm happy.

34
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:52,510
Oh my god.

35
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:54,450
Alireza had it yesterday!

36
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:57,130
Why did it hit me today?!

37
00:03:57,130 --> 00:04:00,190
Like, why did I decide to be like...

38
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:07,810
No, we shouldn't hit her, we shouldn't give her the bad codes, like the broken CSS yesterday.

39
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:11,010
We should do it... we should do it, like, today.

40
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:14,410
That's when she's having the most issues right now.

41
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:21,030
Oh my god, I'm so...

42
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:22,550
Alright, so...

43
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:26,110
Oh my god, the amount of money I've spent today and yesterday...

44
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:28,450
I'm so mad, because I had...

45
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:30,630
Okay, okay, I'll start from the beginning.

46
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:32,510
I'm so sorry, I hate being late.

47
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:34,870
Like, really, really late for streams.

48
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:37,590
Because it's like, so out of my control.

49
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:43,710
And it's like, I'm sorry, because I'm wasting your time.

50
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:46,210
Because you guys are all here waiting for me.

51
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:48,070
And I'm sorry, everybody.

52
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:50,130
I'm so sorry.

53
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:56,270
Oh my god, I'm going through a lot right now.

54
00:04:57,010 --> 00:05:00,850
I just... it's just really frustrating, because it's like, out of my control.

55
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:04,490
And I'm just like, why does it always hit me?

56
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:07,050
Alright, this was my breaking point.

57
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:09,070
Okay, we're gonna play this game soon.

58
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:11,030
But after this game, I'm gonna take...

59
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:13,690
I might have to play God of War.

60
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:16,050
For like, maybe an hour or so.

61
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:18,750
Because I'm gonna take the PC to the shop.

62
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:22,430
Alright, last... okay, I'm gonna start from the very beginning.

63
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:25,010
Alright, story time with Doki.

64
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:27,730
I'm gonna start from... also let me... is Sound Guy here today?

65
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:29,750
I don't know if Sound Guy is here today.

66
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:32,110
Because like, I don't know.

67
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:33,850
I'm worried that I'm starting... I'm gonna start like...

68
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:36,270
My mic's gonna start crackling too at the moment.

69
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:42,110
Because I'm going... I'm going through a lot of stuff.

70
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:45,370
Alright, Sound Guy, let me know if I start crackling or whatever.

71
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:46,130
Alright.

72
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:48,210
We'll start from the beginning.

73
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:49,910
We'll start from the beginning.

74
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:51,190
Tell you how this all went.

75
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:55,130
So, you all know how... how like, you know...

76
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:58,890
We were... we were talking about getting new RAM, right?

77
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:01,050
And I was like, yeah, I'm gonna just take it to the shop.

78
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:02,710
Yeah, because like, you know, I'm afraid.

79
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:04,290
I'm gonna fuck it up.

80
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:04,870
Like, you know.

81
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:07,190
And then, you know, Tenjin...

82
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:09,130
You guys were like, it's just RAM.

83
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:11,050
How could you fuck it up?

84
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:14,130
You just swap the RAM and click it in place.

85
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:16,050
And I was like, oh, I don't know.

86
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:19,070
There's always... I've always had issues with PC problems.

87
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:21,830
And like... and like, I don't know.

88
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:23,470
That's like... that's why I don't... I don't...

89
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:24,550
You should just take it to the PC.

90
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:26,810
Because like, you know, I always have issues.

91
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:31,050
And then Tenjin was like, you can pay me and I'll insert the RAM.

92
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:32,290
Don't take it to the store.

93
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:33,770
Just swap the RAM.

94
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:34,670
It's that easy.

95
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:36,410
It's just RAM.

96
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:38,490
Little did I know.

97
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:41,510
This just RAM issue...

98
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:44,570
Turned out to be a lot more!

99
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:47,330
Than just fucking RAM!

100
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:48,990
Okay, anyway.

101
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:58,130
Thank you, thank you.

102
00:06:58,130 --> 00:07:02,090
Don't you know that we all slept together makes my 101F feel work.

103
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:03,530
Make it less difficult as well.

104
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:04,130
Thank you.

105
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:06,050
So!

106
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:08,470
I have...

107
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:09,030
I have a lot of work to do.

108
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:13,990
So, um... and I played a little Overwatch, but like that's not what that matters right now.

109
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:23,650
So, so at like, um, at like 11pm or midnight, I... okay, so I did a lot of work.

110
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:24,750
I went to the store.

111
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:26,270
Sorry, I got a little ahead of myself.

112
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:30,230
So I did some work first before I went to the PC store.

113
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:38,050
Um, I went to the PC store and, uh, and you know, I was like, hey, I need RAM.

114
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:40,710
I need like, I looked up the RAM I have.

115
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:45,210
I was like, I need 32 gigabytes, uh, a stick, 16 gigabytes of stick.

116
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:49,530
And then so they're like, yeah, we have that, but it comes in black or is that okay?

117
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:54,630
I was like, I didn't really care, you know, I didn't care about like what color the RAM sticks are.

118
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:56,070
Like I don't look at it.

119
00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:57,370
The PC's on the fucking floor.

120
00:07:57,550 --> 00:08:00,210
My desk isn't long enough or big enough to fit.

121
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:02,290
A PC on the side because I have three monitors.

122
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:03,970
So I was like, that's all right.

123
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:05,650
It's not like I'm gonna look at it or anything.

124
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:09,750
Yet everything else in the PC is like, no, there's RGB.

125
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:10,770
It's at the end.

126
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:15,430
Like it's RGB, but the stick itself is not, it's not like fully white.

127
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:16,770
It's just black.

128
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:20,470
Um, so there's RGB at the, you know, at the corner thing.

129
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:26,850
And so like, so like, I was like, I don't care because I was like, oh yeah, that's fine.

130
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:30,190
It's not like I look at my PC anyway, because it's literally on the floor.

131
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:31,130
Like not on the floor.

132
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:32,350
It has a little balcony thing.

133
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:33,970
So it's not sitting on the fucking carpet.

134
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:41,610
It has like a little like, like balcony ledge thing, my desk that purchased it.

135
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:43,410
So like, it's not touching the floor.

136
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:47,150
So like, um, so I was like, by the way, it's touching the floor right now.

137
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:52,470
So like, whatever, like at this point, like if it fucking, I don't care anymore.

138
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:53,110
Like...

139
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:56,270
I don't care anymore.

140
00:08:56,890 --> 00:08:57,250
I...

141
00:08:57,790 --> 00:08:59,350
I'm not at this point...

142
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:00,370
We're in Tokyo.

143
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:02,670
I went through so much.

144
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:03,490
I...

145
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:08,750
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA HAHAHAHAHAHAHA Anyway...

146
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:13,910
So I was like, it's alright if it's just all white except for like the two RAM sticks that's black.

147
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:14,830
I'm fine with that.

148
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:15,490
Like I don't care.

149
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:17,350
So they're like, alright.

150
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:19,930
And then click click click click click click click click.

151
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:22,350
I don't want to type on my keyboard right now.

152
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:23,790
But they're like click click click click click click click.

153
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:27,990
And they're like, oh but we have these RAM sticks.

154
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:29,690
They're not the same brand.

155
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:30,850
But...

156
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:33,490
It is an upgrade.

157
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:35,630
And it's only $20 more.

158
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:37,810
So yeah I'm thinking...

159
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:39,050
Oh upgrade.

160
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:45,170
HAHAHAHAHAHA HAHAHAHAHA And only $20 more?

161
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:46,990
I was just like...

162
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:48,970
But it's the same thing right?

163
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:52,110
And he's like, yeah it's basically the same specs.

164
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:54,610
It's the same specs.

165
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:56,010
And like...

166
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:57,970
And it's just like...

167
00:09:57,990 --> 00:09:58,910
I don't remember what...

168
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:01,010
There was something minor that was like...

169
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:01,970
More of an upgrade.

170
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:03,430
I don't fucking remember the details.

171
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:05,350
I just heard upgrade and it's only $20 more.

172
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:07,350
So I was like, alright that's cool.

173
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:07,810
Yeah.

174
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:09,730
I was like, are you sure it works on my build?

175
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:12,470
Because I have like a profile with them.

176
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:15,990
Because they're the same place I take to fix my PC and stuff.

177
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:17,470
And they were like, yeah.

178
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:19,230
And they were looking up and they were like, yeah yeah.

179
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:21,850
You took this PC for the AMD stuff right?

180
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:22,250
And I was like, yeah.

181
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:23,370
And they were like, yeah yeah.

182
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:24,650
It works with your build.

183
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:27,090
It will even be like an improvement to your build.

184
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:28,630
So I was like, oh sweet.

185
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:28,930
Cool.

186
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:29,470
Alright.

187
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:29,850
Yeah.

188
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:30,470
Fuck it.

189
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:30,710
Let's go.

190
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:32,250
I'll buy it.

191
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:34,110
Like, if you say so.

192
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:35,190
And it's white too.

193
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:36,130
It's fully white.

194
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:37,010
So it'll fit the build.

195
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:39,150
Because like, it's gonna be all white.

196
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:40,510
No, it's DDR5.

197
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:41,550
It's literally the same.

198
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:42,950
Like, I checked it.

199
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:43,830
I was like, are you sure?

200
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:47,510
It's like DDR5 and like 6000's whatever the fuck that was.

201
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:48,410
And they were like, yeah.

202
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:50,950
It's literally the same except for like some fucking upgrade thing.

203
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:51,530
And I don't know.

204
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:52,730
I don't remember what the upgrade was.

205
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:54,570
So.

206
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:56,670
I was just like, alright cool.

207
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:03,560
I was like, are you sure it's gonna work with my build?

208
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,140
And he's like, yeah.

209
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:04,820
It will.

210
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:07,780
Because he looked at my profile!

211
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:11,560
He looked at my fucking PC specs profile!

212
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:15,720
Because they were the same store I went to bring to fix my computer.

213
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:17,680
When it came to like AMD.

214
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:20,060
This AMD CPU motherboard.

215
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,500
So they know what my motherboard is.

216
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:23,640
They...

217
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:32,360
They sold you magic beans a million.

218
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,460
Thank you for the super chat.

219
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:33,920
Thank you.

220
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:34,540
Thank you.

221
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,200
Anyway.

222
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,080
So.

223
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:37,460
I like...

224
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:38,540
So.

225
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:41,180
I brought the RAM back.

226
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,600
By the way, I couldn't...

227
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:46,320
Like the store closed by then when I figured out...

228
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,880
I couldn't like go back and exchange it.

229
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:50,620
And...

230
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,340
And then so.

231
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:53,520
I...

232
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:54,380
You know.

233
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,260
I went home.

234
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:57,720
Did other work stuff.

235
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,960
Because I knew like if I do the RAM stuff it's gonna be like a whole different whole thing.

236
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,060
So I was...

237
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:02,480
Not home.

238
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:02,700
Sorry.

239
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:03,940
The old apartment.

240
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,360
Where my PC still is.

241
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:06,300
And then so.

242
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:07,680
So like I did other stuff.

243
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:09,820
Before like I came back to you know.

244
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:10,620
Um.

245
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:13,700
At 11pm or midnight.

246
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:16,000
I went to install my RAM.

247
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:19,680
Alright.

248
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:20,120
So.

249
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,140
I haven't done...

250
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:22,560
Sorry.

251
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:23,220
I like...

252
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:25,800
I paused because I'm sad.

253
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:31,710
Sorry.

254
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:32,450
The sadness.

255
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:34,190
Like overwhelmed me.

256
00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:35,550
So I had to pause a little bit.

257
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:40,070
Alright.

258
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:43,590
Alright.

259
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:45,190
So.

260
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:46,310
I...

261
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:46,910
You know.

262
00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:49,190
The worst part about doing all this.

263
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:49,650
Is that.

264
00:12:50,090 --> 00:12:50,610
Um.

265
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:52,470
It's very inconvenient.

266
00:12:53,090 --> 00:12:55,310
Plugging and unplugging all the cables again.

267
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:56,050
Um.

268
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:58,150
Because I can't see the...

269
00:12:58,150 --> 00:13:00,510
The ports for the display.

270
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:01,590
For the monitors.

271
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:03,850
So I have to like always feel for it.

272
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:04,350
Um.

273
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:06,190
Because it's like really up against the wall.

274
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:06,850
The desk.

275
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:08,730
So like I had to plug and unplug.

276
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:10,130
So many fucking times.

277
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:12,830
It was so... That was like one of the most frustrating parts.

278
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:13,910
So like at this point.

279
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:14,430
That's why I'm like.

280
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:16,810
I'm not even putting it into the god damn cubby hole anymore.

281
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:18,650
I'm putting it on the fucking floor.

282
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:20,570
Because I cannot be bothered.

283
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:22,130
Because I'm gonna be unplugging it again.

284
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:22,850
Anyway.

285
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:23,870
When I take it to the shop.

286
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:24,470
Okay.

287
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:25,070
So.

288
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:25,910
Um.

289
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:27,410
This is what happened.

290
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:29,390
First attempt.

291
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:32,150
Plugged in the RAM sticks.

292
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:34,330
And then.

293
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:36,330
My monitor wouldn't turn on.

294
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:38,150
And I was like.

295
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:40,110
Why isn't it turning on?

296
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:43,610
I was like.

297
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:44,230
But.

298
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:45,550
The first attempt.

299
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:47,090
The colors weren't on.

300
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:48,130
So I.

301
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:48,730
So like.

302
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:49,170
I was like.

303
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:49,650
Wait.

304
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:51,130
Did I not plug it in correctly?

305
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:52,450
Because the colors weren't on.

306
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:54,630
Because like.

307
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:56,910
It's been like years since I plugged in RAM.

308
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:59,810
Because I had an attempt trying to swap in RAM.

309
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:00,970
And I think.

310
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:03,230
I also failed spectacularly.

311
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:04,570
So that's why I like.

312
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:04,970
Don't.

313
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:06,530
I remember now why I take.

314
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:08,070
I don't even trust myself with RAM.

315
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:10,390
Because this is not the first time I fucked it up.

316
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:11,270
This was in university.

317
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:12,230
Um.

318
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:12,490
Anyway.

319
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:14,410
So I was like.

320
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:14,890
Wait.

321
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:15,850
The colors aren't on.

322
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:17,230
The RGB's not on.

323
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:18,090
So.

324
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:20,750
I tried it on and off.

325
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:21,870
And then I was like.

326
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:24,130
Maybe I need to push it in harder.

327
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:25,550
And so like.

328
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:27,630
I pushed it in harder until I heard the click.

329
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:29,690
On both ends.

330
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:32,550
I heard the click on one of the ends.

331
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:33,450
Um.

332
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:35,170
Oh wait.

333
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:35,290
No.

334
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:35,770
That's the first.

335
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:36,970
The first attempt had no clicks.

336
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:39,670
So I heard a click on one end.

337
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:41,370
One of the ends.

338
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:42,530
And then.

339
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:43,370
So I turned it on.

340
00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:43,850
I was like.

341
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:45,150
The colors on.

342
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:47,030
Yippee.

343
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:47,670
Alright.

344
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:52,190
So I was like.

345
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:52,910
I'm gonna try it on.

346
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:55,730
It worked.

347
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:57,050
I did it.

348
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:58,010
I was so happy.

349
00:14:58,110 --> 00:14:58,310
I was like.

350
00:14:58,550 --> 00:14:59,090
Yeah.

351
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:00,110
I did it.

352
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:02,010
It was that easy.

353
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:03,970
Oh my god.

354
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:04,870
They were right.

355
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:07,890
Plugging in RAM was that easy.

356
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:10,390
Little did I know.

357
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:11,490
Nothing turned on.

358
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:13,070
The monitor didn't turn on.

359
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:14,070
And I was like.

360
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:14,630
Wait.

361
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:17,510
That's not how it's supposed to happen.

362
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:19,470
Why is the colors.

363
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:20,370
I was like.

364
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:22,870
Oh maybe it's cause I need two sticks.

365
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:24,830
Maybe that's why.

366
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:26,030
Like.

367
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:29,610
Maybe I just need both of the sticks in.

368
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:31,710
So then I plugged in the second stick.

369
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:33,330
I plugged in the second stick.

370
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:33,590
I plugged in the second stick.

371
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:35,070
Until I heard one click.

372
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:38,990
And then.

373
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:39,790
I was like.

374
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:40,390
Oh.

375
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:42,490
The monitor didn't turn on.

376
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:43,210
I was like.

377
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:43,850
Oh.

378
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:46,250
Why didn't the monitor turn on?

379
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:47,930
I was very frustrated.

380
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:48,670
I was.

381
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:49,650
By the way.

382
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:50,930
I just need you to know.

383
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:52,810
There's two openings on my PC.

384
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:54,630
I was very fucking frustrated.

385
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:55,570
Because I didn't want.

386
00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:57,070
The first time.

387
00:15:57,330 --> 00:15:59,090
I didn't want to like.

388
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:01,550
Bring my PC out fully out of the cubby hole.

389
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:03,610
Because it's very frustrating and tilting.

390
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:05,170
To put it in the cubby hole.

391
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:06,210
So I was just like.

392
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:06,730
Okay.

393
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:07,610
I'm just gonna like.

394
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:09,690
Halfway push it out of the cubby hole.

395
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:11,910
And then work on one end.

396
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:13,690
Of the.

397
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:15,930
One end of the glass.

398
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:17,510
Because there's like two sides.

399
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:18,410
One is where like.

400
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:18,670
You know.

401
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:20,510
You can access everything.

402
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:22,390
The other is the side panel.

403
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:23,390
So like.

404
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:24,330
Not the back side.

405
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:27,990
But like the tiny square rectangular side.

406
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:31,170
The really tiny rectangular side.

407
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:31,710
The really tiny rectangular side.

408
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:33,710
I used that to plug in the RAM.

409
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:34,930
Because I was like.

410
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:35,370
By the way.

411
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:36,610
I had to have the flashlight on too.

412
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:37,250
Like on my phone.

413
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:38,310
So I was just like.

414
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:38,810
Alright.

415
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:39,870
Because I thought.

416
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:41,210
I thought.

417
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:43,350
It was gonna be so easy.

418
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:44,970
Hahahaha.

419
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:48,030
Hahahaha.

420
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:48,430
Hahahaha.

421
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:50,110
Anyway.

422
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:51,550
I think like.

423
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:53,130
One hour passed.

424
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:55,990
During all of this.

425
00:16:56,830 --> 00:16:58,130
Never plug in RAM.

426
00:16:58,250 --> 00:16:59,350
When the power is on.

427
00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:01,090
Hahahaha.

428
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:04,650
I may or may not have done that.

429
00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:05,550
Like once or twice.

430
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:07,690
Because I was so mad and frustrated.

431
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:10,070
I just need to know that.

432
00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:12,330
I was incredibly frustrated.

433
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:15,510
And have done that at least once or twice.

434
00:17:15,690 --> 00:17:16,970
Today or yesterday.

435
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:18,050
Yesterday.

436
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:19,670
Once.

437
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:21,010
Twice yesterday.

438
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:22,190
And once today.

439
00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:23,530
Hahahaha.

440
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:26,450
Hahahaha.

441
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:27,410
Hahahaha.

442
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:29,390
Hahahaha.

443
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:31,470
Um.

444
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:33,270
Anyway.

445
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:35,910
Hahahaha.

446
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:38,910
Hahahaha.

447
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:40,370
Anyway.

448
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:42,550
Anyway.

449
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:44,190
That's what I was saying.

450
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:46,010
Um.

451
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:47,830
Okay.

452
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:48,330
But like.

453
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:49,770
I did turn the PC on.

454
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:52,430
It was just the power was plugged in.

455
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:53,490
That's all I'll say.

456
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:55,010
I didn't turn the PC on.

457
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:56,870
When I swapped it.

458
00:17:57,050 --> 00:17:57,690
But like.

459
00:17:57,690 --> 00:17:59,030
When I took it out.

460
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:00,030
But like.

461
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:02,110
The plug was plugged in.

462
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:02,750
Hahahaha.

463
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:04,730
I forgot to unplug it.

464
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:05,790
Hahahaha.

465
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:06,970
Not forgot.

466
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:08,130
I was so frustrated.

467
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:09,530
Oh that's fine.

468
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:09,910
Okay.

469
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:11,210
I did not do that.

470
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:11,710
Okay.

471
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:13,190
I did not unplug.

472
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:16,330
I did not take the RAM out while the PC is on.

473
00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:16,970
By the way.

474
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:18,250
I did not do that.

475
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:20,430
I just did that like.

476
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:22,130
Three times.

477
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:23,190
Um.

478
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:24,150
Yesterday and today.

479
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:26,530
While the outlet was on.

480
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:27,770
And then I was like.

481
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:28,290
Oh fuck.

482
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:28,730
Okay.

483
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:29,030
Whatever.

484
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:30,150
Hahahaha.

485
00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:32,470
No.

486
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:33,230
I didn't do that.

487
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:33,510
Okay.

488
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:33,930
Anyway.

489
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:35,750
So that's one hour.

490
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:38,570
And I was very sad.

491
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:39,170
And frustrated.

492
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:40,450
Cause I was like.

493
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:43,010
That was one hour's past.

494
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:43,990
By the way.

495
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:45,190
And so.

496
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:48,510
So.

497
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:50,430
I was very desperate.

498
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:53,990
I like texted one of my.

499
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:55,710
Tech literate friends.

500
00:18:55,890 --> 00:18:57,290
Who works in IT.

501
00:18:57,610 --> 00:18:58,370
And stuff.

502
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:00,150
And I was like.

503
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:01,070
Uh.

504
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:03,790
Hahahaha.

505
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:06,050
I was like.

506
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:08,370
I don't know what to do.

507
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:10,010
Hahahaha.

508
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:12,990
I like took a picture of the RAM.

509
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:13,210
I was like.

510
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:15,410
What am I doing wrong?

511
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:16,710
Hahahaha.

512
00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:18,450
And.

513
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:20,610
They were like.

514
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:23,290
They were like.

515
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:24,430
Um.

516
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:25,210
They were like.

517
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:25,770
Okay.

518
00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:28,250
Did you fully plugged in the RAM?

519
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:28,950
And I was like.

520
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:30,630
I think so.

521
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:32,130
The colors are on.

522
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:33,450
There's.

523
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:35,270
There's colors on it.

524
00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:36,350
It's RGB.

525
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:38,890
And then my friend was like.

526
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:39,590
Yes.

527
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:41,930
But did you fully pushed it in?

528
00:19:42,370 --> 00:19:44,310
The colors can turn on.

529
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:46,430
Even if it's half way in.

530
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:47,570
I was like.

531
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:49,170
I can't do that.

532
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:50,570
But like.

533
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:52,190
The colors are on.

534
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:53,050
Hahahaha.

535
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:54,890
Hahahaha.

536
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:57,950
So I realized.

537
00:19:58,270 --> 00:20:00,470
I only pushed it half way in.

538
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:01,530
So.

539
00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:02,410
Hahahaha.

540
00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:05,030
I didn't hear two clicks.

541
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:06,810
I heard one click.

542
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:10,230
Because apparently only the one half of it.

543
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:11,230
Um.

544
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:13,830
One half of it.

545
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:14,790
Was in.

546
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:16,410
The other half wasn't.

547
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:18,670
Um.

548
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:19,330
So.

549
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:20,390
So.

550
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:22,270
I pushed it all the way in.

551
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:23,730
I pushed it all the way in.

552
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:25,390
For two clicks this time.

553
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:27,250
And I turned it on.

554
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:28,710
But.

555
00:20:29,290 --> 00:20:31,130
The monitor didn't turn on.

556
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:33,150
I was so confused.

557
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:36,450
Why is my monitor not turning on?

558
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:37,750
So.

559
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:39,910
Then we went through all of that.

560
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:40,730
And I was like.

561
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:42,490
Are you sure you put it two.

562
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:43,470
I swear to god.

563
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:44,870
If anybody says.

564
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:46,350
Are you sure you put it two four.

565
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:47,530
Are you sure.

566
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:48,790
I swear to god.

567
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:49,330
If I see.

568
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:50,030
Hahahaha.

569
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:50,910
I am.

570
00:20:51,010 --> 00:20:51,710
I was like.

571
00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:53,230
I literally just put it.

572
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:55,270
Where my old RAM was.

573
00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:57,490
Yes it's at two to four.

574
00:20:57,850 --> 00:20:58,530
Hahahaha.

575
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:02,170
I know I'm stupid.

576
00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:03,630
But yes.

577
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:05,810
It was at two four.

578
00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:07,370
Hahahaha.

579
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:09,470
Hahahaha.

580
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:11,630
Okay.

581
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:12,650
So.

582
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:13,530
Um.

583
00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:14,610
So basically.

584
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:16,930
I was so confused.

585
00:21:16,930 --> 00:21:17,770
I was like.

586
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:19,070
Why is it not.

587
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:21,290
Why is the monitor not turning on.

588
00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:23,090
Like what's going on.

589
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:24,410
So then.

590
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:25,210
They were like.

591
00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:25,750
Oh maybe.

592
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:28,130
Maybe you should try one stick at a time.

593
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:28,790
I was like.

594
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:30,110
Oh okay.

595
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:30,610
I'll.

596
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:31,770
I'll.

597
00:21:31,770 --> 00:21:32,050
I'll.

598
00:21:32,050 --> 00:21:32,210
I'll.

599
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:34,290
Put them one and two.

600
00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:34,770
Thank you.

601
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:40,550
So by the way.

602
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:41,430
They also were.

603
00:21:41,530 --> 00:21:42,610
We got desperate.

604
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:43,830
At one point we put three four.

605
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:49,330
And it was so hard to take out one of the RAM sticks.

606
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:50,050
Because like.

607
00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:51,610
We couldn't figure out.

608
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:54,230
We were fucking troubleshooting for four hours.

609
00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:54,990
I need to know.

610
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:58,070
We were fucking troubleshooting for four fucking hours.

611
00:21:58,610 --> 00:21:59,130
Um.

612
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:01,970
I went home at four in the morning.

613
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:02,910
Hahahaha.

614
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:05,830
Because I thought I was the problem.

615
00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:07,170
Okay.

616
00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:09,030
As I was saying.

617
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:10,790
Um.

618
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:12,090
So.

619
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:13,970
At that point.

620
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:15,590
I took out the entire PC.

621
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:16,810
Out of the cubby hole.

622
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:17,770
And like.

623
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:19,170
Opened the side panel.

624
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:21,270
The full front panel.

625
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:22,930
Because at that point I was like.

626
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:23,390
By the way.

627
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:24,290
It's like night time.

628
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:25,910
I can barely see anything.

629
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:27,970
So even with the flashlight.

630
00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:30,670
It's so hard to see anything.

631
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:31,770
By the way.

632
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:32,030
They were like.

633
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:34,070
Are you sure you put in the right side?

634
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:36,690
So they want me to turn around it?

635
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:37,670
And I turned it around.

636
00:22:37,770 --> 00:22:38,610
And I couldn't click it in.

637
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:41,010
So I knew it was the right side.

638
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:43,730
Because I couldn't turn it around.

639
00:22:44,050 --> 00:22:44,990
And put it on.

640
00:22:45,410 --> 00:22:45,810
Anyway.

641
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:47,990
Hahahaha.

642
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:50,910
So.

643
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:53,470
This is the moment where I fucking finally.

644
00:22:53,630 --> 00:22:55,930
Pulled out the entire fucking PC.

645
00:22:55,970 --> 00:22:56,750
Out of the cubby.

646
00:22:57,310 --> 00:22:57,750
And.

647
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:01,310
Decided to use the front panel.

648
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:02,890
I can't.

649
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:04,270
I can't deal with this anymore.

650
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:05,250
And so.

651
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:08,530
I swapped RAM sticks around.

652
00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:10,750
And put the 4 in the 2.

653
00:23:11,010 --> 00:23:12,250
And the 2 in the 4.

654
00:23:12,410 --> 00:23:13,150
Nothing worked.

655
00:23:13,410 --> 00:23:14,850
And so I did one stick.

656
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:16,450
One stick at 4.

657
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:17,710
And so.

658
00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:19,290
It turned on.

659
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:21,730
It turned on.

660
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:24,230
And I was like.

661
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:25,250
Oh my god.

662
00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:27,410
It's on.

663
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:33,050
And it didn't take me to like.

664
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:33,990
My loading screen.

665
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:36,930
It was stuck in this weird ass screen.

666
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:38,490
Where it was like.

667
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:40,010
It is incompatible or something.

668
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:40,690
I don't know.

669
00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:43,050
It just gave me some weird fucking.

670
00:23:43,770 --> 00:23:44,290
Like.

671
00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:46,290
Tech info.

672
00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:46,810
Where they're like.

673
00:23:46,930 --> 00:23:50,170
We detect like zero hard drive.

674
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:52,130
One mouse.

675
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:53,730
One keyboard.

676
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:56,050
Two SSDs.

677
00:23:56,050 --> 00:23:56,950
Like it gave me that.

678
00:23:57,170 --> 00:23:58,610
So I was so confused.

679
00:23:58,910 --> 00:23:59,670
I was like.

680
00:23:59,970 --> 00:24:01,490
What does that mean?

681
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:03,790
I don't understand.

682
00:24:03,930 --> 00:24:05,990
Why can't I get to anywhere?

683
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:07,130
And then they're like.

684
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:09,070
Go to the BIOS.

685
00:24:09,290 --> 00:24:09,630
And I was like.

686
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:10,050
Okay.

687
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:14,710
Save and quit.

688
00:24:14,890 --> 00:24:16,530
So it'll go straight to the loading screen.

689
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:17,470
So then.

690
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:19,510
Save and quit.

691
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:21,510
And then it went back to that fucking.

692
00:24:21,850 --> 00:24:22,810
Random ass.

693
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:23,890
Menu thing.

694
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:25,330
And I was so confused.

695
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:26,290
I was like.

696
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:27,670
What does that mean?

697
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:28,730
Why can't I.

698
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:30,450
But it's on.

699
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:32,610
The PC is on.

700
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:33,690
The miner is on.

701
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:35,050
So then I was like.

702
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:35,630
Okay.

703
00:24:35,730 --> 00:24:37,130
I am going to.

704
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:42,390
I am going to now try the other RAM stick.

705
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:44,510
Maybe the other RAM stick.

706
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:50,250
And then.

707
00:24:52,410 --> 00:24:53,510
It's the same thing.

708
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:54,150
It works.

709
00:24:54,370 --> 00:24:55,950
It takes me to that screen.

710
00:24:56,530 --> 00:24:57,130
And I was like.

711
00:24:57,510 --> 00:25:01,930
Now I am going to put two RAM sticks in.

712
00:25:02,810 --> 00:25:03,890
And the moment.

713
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:04,950
I put in.

714
00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:06,870
Two RAM sticks.

715
00:25:07,170 --> 00:25:08,670
My monitor doesn't turn on.

716
00:25:09,530 --> 00:25:10,910
So I was confused.

717
00:25:11,530 --> 00:25:12,050
I was like.

718
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:14,210
One works but two doesn't?

719
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:16,390
What?

720
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:18,710
What?

721
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:19,730
What do you mean?

722
00:25:19,890 --> 00:25:22,170
I don't understand.

723
00:25:23,170 --> 00:25:24,850
I don't understand.

724
00:25:26,410 --> 00:25:27,070
So.

725
00:25:29,290 --> 00:25:29,950
So.

726
00:25:30,050 --> 00:25:31,310
So I was like.

727
00:25:31,570 --> 00:25:33,070
What did I do wrong?

728
00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:35,510
Everybody said.

729
00:25:35,610 --> 00:25:36,970
It was so easy.

730
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:39,580
That it's just RAM.

731
00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:42,750
I was like.

732
00:25:42,890 --> 00:25:45,090
What did I do wrong?

733
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:46,130
I

734
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:56,260
was like.

735
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:56,360
What did I do wrong?

736
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:57,020
I was like.

737
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,180
What did I do wrong?

738
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,420
So.

739
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:03,740
I was like.

740
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:04,440
Okay.

741
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:07,880
I am going to.

742
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:09,880
I give up.

743
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:11,600
After the four hour.

744
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:13,820
After the four hour.

745
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:15,480
I gave up.

746
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,500
Because I was so tired.

747
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:20,800
I was so fucking tired.

748
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,200
I was like.

749
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:28,420
I put in my old RAM.

750
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:29,500
It works.

751
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:30,180
Oh.

752
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:32,000
My old RAM works.

753
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:32,680
Wow.

754
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:34,540
So.

755
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:36,800
So.

756
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,240
At the four hour mark.

757
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:39,200
I was like.

758
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:40,920
I give up.

759
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:41,480
I'm just.

760
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:44,540
I'm just going to buy.

761
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,660
I was like.

762
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:47,880
Maybe it's this RAM.

763
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,040
Maybe it's incompatible.

764
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,600
For my PC.

765
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:54,680
Even though the seller said it was compatible.

766
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,640
Maybe it wasn't compatible.

767
00:26:58,700 --> 00:26:59,300
Maybe it wasn't compatible.

768
00:26:59,300 --> 00:26:59,420
And.

769
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:02,660
After they looked at my fucking profile.

770
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:03,440
Okay.

771
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:04,920
I was like.

772
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:05,760
I was like.

773
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:08,220
I'm just going to go back and buy the black RAM.

774
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,280
Because it's the same brand.

775
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:13,520
I'm just going to buy the black RAM.

776
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,320
Since it's the same.

777
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:17,740
Same one.

778
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:18,940
And like.

779
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,460
It's just 64 instead of 32.

780
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:23,480
And then.

781
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,460
And then my friend was like.

782
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,800
Just take your PC to the shop.

783
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:31,940
I was like.

784
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:32,700
No.

785
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,900
Why did I say no.

786
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:37,980
Like.

787
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:38,900
It's not compatible.

788
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:44,460
I don't need to take it to the shop.

789
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:47,900
My dragoons and tangents said it's that easy.

790
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:49,220
Maybe I just.

791
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:49,840
Maybe I just.

792
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:51,360
Maybe the RAM is just.

793
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:53,040
Incompatible.

794
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:55,260
And I'll just get new RAM.

795
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:56,500
And it'll be fine.

796
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:59,380
I know how to swap RAM now.

797
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,880
I know how to swap RAM now.

798
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,240
Like I learned.

799
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:05,220
And my friend was like.

800
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,260
You should really take the PC to the shop.

801
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:09,740
You should really let them handle it.

802
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:18,020
You should.

803
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:20,440
I think they can handle this.

804
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:22,120
I really think you should take it.

805
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:22,320
I was like.

806
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:23,540
But it's so heavy.

807
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:26,600
I was just like.

808
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:29,980
But the PC is so heavy.

809
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:30,720
Though.

810
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,420
It's just easier.

811
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:35,140
To go.

812
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:38,160
I don't want to carry my PC.

813
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:40,620
Early in the morning.

814
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:42,100
I'm tired.

815
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:44,480
I don't want to be able to sleep much.

816
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:46,260
Because we've been doing this.

817
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:50,420
I was like.

818
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:52,180
I don't want to go.

819
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:53,820
So early in the morning.

820
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,860
I have two streams today.

821
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:03,000
So I chose.

822
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:05,900
To just exchange the RAM.

823
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:08,480
To the one I actually wanted.

824
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:09,980
And so.

825
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:10,840
So.

826
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,140
The worst part of all of this.

827
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:13,800
Is that.

828
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,380
Instead of taking public transport.

829
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:16,580
That was so much cheaper.

830
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,200
I had to Uber.

831
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,500
At 4 in the morning.

832
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:25,240
And that shit was expensive.

833
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:27,860
All the money I saved yesterday.

834
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:29,980
By taking public transport.

835
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:32,300
By googling how to pay for bus.

836
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:33,760
Gone.

837
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:35,500
Because I had to Uber.

838
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:36,840
At 4 in the morning.

839
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:44,240
It's so sad.

840
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:48,960
Because the next.

841
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:51,920
The next fucking bus.

842
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:54,520
Was at 5 in the morning.

843
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:55,240
And I was like.

844
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:56,520
I'm not going to wait an hour.

845
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:00,400
I'm not going to wait an hour.

846
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:01,680
To fucking.

847
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,860
I want to be in bed.

848
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,520
Like at that point.

849
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:05,960
I was like.

850
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:07,860
I want to be in bed.

851
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:10,400
I don't want to fucking wait an hour.

852
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:10,860
For the.

853
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:11,780
Just drive.

854
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:13,920
I've not touched a car in 9 years.

855
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,740
If I just drive.

856
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,380
At 4 in the morning.

857
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,680
When it's night time.

858
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:22,200
I barely am surviving during the day.

859
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,180
Let alone night.

860
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:25,180
Like.

861
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:27,060
Like.

862
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:28,520
Like.

863
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:29,360
Like.

864
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:30,240
Like.

865
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,100
Like.

866
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:31,480
Like.

867
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:32,060
But.

868
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:33,140
Anyway.

869
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:37,780
I have a driver's license.

870
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:39,940
I just don't.

871
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:41,540
I just haven't driven.

872
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:42,820
Since getting it.

873
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:43,780
Anyway.

874
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:48,140
Look the roads have to be safe.

875
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:48,940
For people.

876
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:51,160
And putting me behind a car.

877
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:53,420
Is not going to make that happen.

878
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:54,460
Anyway.

879
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:57,120
Fast forward to.

880
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:58,380
Today.

881
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:01,640
Fast forward to today.

882
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:03,480
So I was like.

883
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:04,300
Oh.

884
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:07,820
I'm going to go to the PC store.

885
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:09,320
Um.

886
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:10,960
I'm so tired.

887
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:11,500
I was like.

888
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:14,120
I need to get there.

889
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:17,500
Before my stream.

890
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:18,780
But like.

891
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:19,540
It's okay.

892
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:24,140
The public transport to the PC place.

893
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:25,580
Can't be that bad.

894
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:26,800
One hour.

895
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:28,220
Laughing.

896
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:31,580
Laughing.

897
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:33,880
Laughing.

898
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:35,420
Laughing.

899
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:37,360
Laughing.

900
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:41,120
And it was already like.

901
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:43,020
Laughing.

902
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:43,820
Laughing.

903
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:45,540
Like.

904
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:47,080
11.

905
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:50,280
11 something ish.

906
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:52,460
Because I had to go to a specific place.

907
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:54,500
Because I had to go back to the same store.

908
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:56,300
To return it.

909
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:57,840
And I was just like.

910
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:59,240
And I was nothing.

911
00:31:59,240 --> 00:31:59,460
Look.

912
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:02,880
I had to be back by 12.30.

913
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:05,480
I was not going to risk it.

914
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:06,420
Anyway.

915
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:08,940
Stream did get delayed.

916
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:09,540
Anyway.

917
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:10,960
I didn't think it was going to be.

918
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:11,840
I thought it was going to be on time.

919
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:12,660
Because I thought.

920
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:13,300
Oh.

921
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,580
If I had the right RAM.

922
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:16,120
Everything will be fine.

923
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:17,240
Anyway.

924
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,880
Guess who had to Uber again.

925
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:20,720
Guess.

926
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:23,000
Guess who had to Uber again.

927
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:24,080
Laughing.

928
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:25,800
Laughing.

929
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:28,560
So.

930
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:31,500
I had to pay for another Uber.

931
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:32,540
Laughing.

932
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:35,400
To get to the fucking PC store.

933
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:36,960
Because I was like.

934
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:40,540
I don't think I'm going to make it there in time.

935
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:42,080
If I take public transport.

936
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:44,300
Public transport.

937
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:45,880
It's going to take me an hour.

938
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:47,560
I'm not going to make it in time.

939
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:48,500
And.

940
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:50,380
I had to take public transport.

941
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:52,260
Back to the old apartment.

942
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:53,280
Because I was like.

943
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:54,440
I'm not taking a second.

944
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:56,160
I'm holding RAM.

945
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,720
I'm not taking a second.

946
00:32:58,360 --> 00:32:59,240
Second Uber.

947
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:00,620
Laughing.

948
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:02,980
And so.

949
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:04,580
And so.

950
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:06,040
I went to the store.

951
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:07,820
I went to the store.

952
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:08,380
And I was like.

953
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:08,960
Hi.

954
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,640
I got this RAM.

955
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:13,320
That your staff recommended.

956
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:15,440
But it wouldn't work.

957
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,740
One stick worked.

958
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:20,780
But when I plugged in two sticks.

959
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:22,360
It didn't work.

960
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:24,020
And I think it's incompatible.

961
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:25,080
Or like.

962
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:28,800
Doesn't match with my motherboard.

963
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:29,900
And CPU.

964
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:31,380
And they were like.

965
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:33,660
They were like.

966
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:33,860
Alright.

967
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:34,800
Let's test it out.

968
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:36,700
Are you sure?

969
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:37,900
Are you sure it's incompatible?

970
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:39,320
I don't know.

971
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:41,040
I don't know.

972
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,320
I don't know anymore.

973
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:44,400
Laughing.

974
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:46,480
Laughing.

975
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,900
I was like.

976
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,300
I don't know anymore.

977
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:52,500
Laughing.

978
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:55,120
Laughing.

979
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:56,800
So.

980
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,840
So they were like.

981
00:33:59,100 --> 00:33:59,520
Alright.

982
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,040
We're gonna plug.

983
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:03,300
We're gonna test it out for you.

984
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:04,340
Just to make sure.

985
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:05,580
So they like.

986
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,820
And they like came back.

987
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:11,240
And was like.

988
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,080
Yeah it was faulty.

989
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:12,420
Sorry.

990
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:13,220
And I was like.

991
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:14,260
Laughing.

992
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,360
Laughing.

993
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,140
They were like.

994
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:18,020
Yeah sorry.

995
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:20,380
The RAM sticks were defective.

996
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:20,900
Laughing.

997
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:24,720
Laughing.

998
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:31,950
And the RAM sticks were defective.

999
00:34:32,390 --> 00:34:33,070
Laughing.

1000
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:34,310
They were fucking.

1001
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:37,560
I was so.

1002
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:38,860
Ahhhh.

1003
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:43,640
Laughing.

1004
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:45,100
I bought those sticks.

1005
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,580
For a recommendation.

1006
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:48,900
Because a man said.

1007
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,760
Oh it's just $20 more.

1008
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:51,560
It'll be an upgrade.

1009
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:52,080
And I was like.

1010
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:52,800
An upgrade?

1011
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:54,480
And it was defective.

1012
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:56,080
It was looking defective.

1013
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:01,070
Laughing.

1014
00:35:01,270 --> 00:35:03,250
I paid.

1015
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:04,530
Uber.

1016
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:06,850
I paid for Uber.

1017
00:35:06,970 --> 00:35:08,010
Last day.

1018
00:35:08,130 --> 00:35:09,450
Because of some RAM.

1019
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:12,840
Laughing.

1020
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:12,940
Laughing.

1021
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:13,660
Laughing.

1022
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:16,940
Oh my god.

1023
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:18,320
Anyway.

1024
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,060
I was like.

1025
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:20,620
They were like.

1026
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:22,280
Do you want the same one?

1027
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:23,100
You know.

1028
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:23,880
The same one.

1029
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:24,680
Or do you want like.

1030
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,500
That old.

1031
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:26,060
The other brand.

1032
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,840
Like the same brand that you had before.

1033
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:28,840
I was like.

1034
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:31,860
I would like those black sticks please.

1035
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:32,700
Laughing.

1036
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:35,760
Because I wasn't going to risk it again.

1037
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:36,940
Laughing.

1038
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:40,460
I wasn't going to fucking risk it again.

1039
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:41,640
Laughing.

1040
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,400
It looks just like the old sticks.

1041
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:45,340
But black.

1042
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:46,320
And like.

1043
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,280
32 gigabytes more.

1044
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:50,300
And I'm just like.

1045
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:51,020
Okay.

1046
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,520
That should be fine.

1047
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:53,740
Like.

1048
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:54,900
It's just RAM.

1049
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:56,920
Just like everybody else said.

1050
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:58,620
It's just RAM.

1051
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:00,600
Laughing.

1052
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,040
Laughing.

1053
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:03,340
Laughing.

1054
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:05,660
Laughing.

1055
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:07,820
Laughing.

1056
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,240
I took public transport.

1057
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,440
Back to my old place.

1058
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:15,220
And then I was like.

1059
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:15,620
Alright.

1060
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:16,560
I'm going to.

1061
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,840
Take the fucking PC.

1062
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:19,340
Oh wait.

1063
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:19,460
No.

1064
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:20,660
The PC is not out of the cubby hole.

1065
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,560
I stopped putting it in the cubby hole after that.

1066
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,200
And then I plugged in.

1067
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:25,760
I plugged in.

1068
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:28,280
Both of the new RAM in.

1069
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:30,980
And then I turned it on.

1070
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:34,100
And I saw the monitor turned on.

1071
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:35,740
And my lock screen.

1072
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:37,580
Is on as well.

1073
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:39,040
And I was like.

1074
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:40,080
Oh my god.

1075
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:41,960
It's working.

1076
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:45,520
And I pushed it all into the cubby hole.

1077
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:47,740
And after that.

1078
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:48,020
I was like.

1079
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:48,260
Alright.

1080
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:48,660
It's working.

1081
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:49,640
That's all I need to know.

1082
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:50,980
I turned off my PC.

1083
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:55,040
Plugged everything back into my fucking.

1084
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:57,320
Cubby hole.

1085
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:59,520
Plugged all my wires in.

1086
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:00,520
And everything.

1087
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,560
Turn the PC back on.

1088
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:03,680
And I was like.

1089
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:04,600
Oh my god.

1090
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,320
Everything is working.

1091
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:08,120
Oh my god.

1092
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:10,460
And I looked at my task manager.

1093
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:12,360
Memory.

1094
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:13,720
64.

1095
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:14,780
I was like.

1096
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:15,520
Oh my god.

1097
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:16,600
It's working.

1098
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:18,040
It's 64.

1099
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:21,900
Turn on Chrome.

1100
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:23,360
Blue screen of death.

1101
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:24,880
Blue screen of death.

1102
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:26,560
Something is wrong with your PC.

1103
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:27,560
And I was like.

1104
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:28,280
Huh?

1105
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:30,320
What?

1106
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:31,200
What?

1107
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:34,900
I made it this far.

1108
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:36,200
I made it this far.

1109
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:37,460
I made it this far.

1110
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:41,860
What do you mean blue screen of death?

1111
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:44,160
And then the monitor would not turn back on.

1112
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:45,960
And then the monitor would not turn back on.

1113
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:47,800
We're going to restart your PC for you.

1114
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:50,020
And to figure out what the issue is.

1115
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:52,600
And the monitor never turned back on.

1116
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:56,180
The monitor never turned back on.

1117
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,060
The monitor never turned back on.

1118
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:58,840
I had to.

1119
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:02,160
I pushed it out of the cubby hole.

1120
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:06,630
I pushed it out of the cubby hole.

1121
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:09,230
I pushed it out of the cubby hole.

1122
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:15,540
I pushed it out of the cubby hole.

1123
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:16,340
And I was like.

1124
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:17,160
And I was like.

1125
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:17,240
Okay.

1126
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:20,680
What's the issue now?

1127
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:22,440
What's the issue now?

1128
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,140
Swap the RAM sticks.

1129
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,140
Swap the 4 to the 2.

1130
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:28,300
To the 2 and the 4.

1131
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:29,560
And then.

1132
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:31,780
So it didn't work.

1133
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,000
Nothing worked.

1134
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:35,840
Nothing worked.

1135
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:37,460
You were here.

1136
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:39,240
You were all here.

1137
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:42,040
Nothing worked.

1138
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:46,000
Everything just led me back to the blue screen.

1139
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,040
Laughing.

1140
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:58,400
Everything led me back to the blue screen.

1141
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:00,120
Laughing.

1142
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:05,600
Thank you for the super chat.

1143
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:06,620
Thank you, thank you.

1144
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:09,340
I worked with PC assembly lines in the past.

1145
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:13,720
Defective RAM slots or RAM sticks are an occasional occurrence.

1146
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:16,520
It feels like 1 to 60 sticks are likely to be defective.

1147
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:17,960
You won the lottery!

1148
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:20,000
Thank you for the super chat, Rage.

1149
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:20,760
Thank you, thank you.

1150
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:24,740
How many lotteries am I gonna win related to PCs?

1151
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:26,220
How many?

1152
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,080
How many times?

1153
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:33,040
I've won the Intel lottery twice.

1154
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,600
Back to back.

1155
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:40,480
I won the RAM lottery.

1156
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:42,640
I won the tw...

1157
00:39:49,770 --> 00:39:52,810
Everybody else is okay with their PCs.

1158
00:39:53,270 --> 00:39:56,690
Yeah, I absorbed everyone else's PC problems.

1159
00:39:56,830 --> 00:40:00,690
Every single PC problem that occurs in the world.

1160
00:40:00,890 --> 00:40:02,730
I absorb it all.

1161
00:40:03,270 --> 00:40:06,970
It doesn't matter how much money I throw into the problem.

1162
00:40:07,290 --> 00:40:08,610
It doesn't matter.

1163
00:40:08,750 --> 00:40:11,490
It doesn't matter if I'm an unlucky bitch.

1164
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:12,510
Like...

1165
00:40:14,050 --> 00:40:15,790
Oh my god.

1166
00:40:20,130 --> 00:40:21,770
It doesn't matter.

1167
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:29,940
I can't believe it.

1168
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:31,240
Every inch.

1169
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:38,620
The thing is, this has been a consistent issue in my life ever since I started streaming.

1170
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:41,820
It doesn't matter how much money I throw at the problem.

1171
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:44,840
I'll always have something go wrong.

1172
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:47,500
I'm making more money now.

1173
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:48,980
But it's still the same.

1174
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:51,120
It's still the fucking same.

1175
00:40:57,020 --> 00:40:58,200
It's actually crazy.

1176
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:00,620
It's actually crazy.

1177
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:06,460
It doesn't just affect my PCs.

1178
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:08,300
It affects my laptops too.

1179
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:09,560
Like, I don't understand.

1180
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:10,260
I...

1181
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:10,760
I...

1182
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:16,660
Oh my god...

1183
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:22,300
Santino, thank you for the super chat.

1184
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:22,700
Thank you.

1185
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:23,060
Thank you.

1186
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:25,260
Here's a bid to wish you the next Uber.

1187
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:31,140
Guess who has to take an Uber to bring this PC to the fucking store.

1188
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:33,200
That's right!

1189
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,720
That's another Uber today.

1190
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:39,240
I'm so sad.

1191
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:43,620
I have to take a back to back Uber too by the way.

1192
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:49,780
Because I have to take an Uber to the store and then an Uber back from the store.

1193
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:52,320
I'm gonna fucking... I'm gonna be like...

1194
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:56,440
Please, I don't care if there's 20 PCs ahead of me.

1195
00:41:56,660 --> 00:42:00,400
It's RAB and literally everybody says it's just RAB.

1196
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:03,360
So clearly you know how to do it fast.

1197
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:07,760
I swear to God, if you make me wait two fucking hours.

1198
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:14,400
Or the next day to pick up my PC when everybody has told me it's just RAB.

1199
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:21,040
I swear to fucking God.

1200
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:29,120
Because apparently it's so easy.

1201
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:34,900
Oh my God.

1202
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:42,900
So yeah.

1203
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:45,440
Anyway, after all that shit.

1204
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:46,620
After I plugged it.

1205
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:48,940
By the way, for those who got here late.

1206
00:42:49,180 --> 00:42:52,600
It did not end with me plugging back my old RAM.

1207
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:57,700
Because the moment I fucking...

1208
00:42:57,700 --> 00:43:00,940
I plugged in my old RAM so nothing was...

1209
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:02,980
40 minutes delay, stream delay.

1210
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:06,600
But like no progress at all for my PC.

1211
00:43:06,940 --> 00:43:08,000
It's like...

1212
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:10,260
40 minutes delay, stream delay.

1213
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:11,020
40 minutes.

1214
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:13,900
Like stream got delayed for 40 minutes.

1215
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:15,580
No progress happened.

1216
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:17,140
No upgrades has happened.

1217
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:18,560
My PC is still the same.

1218
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:21,500
So I was like, alright, fuck it.

1219
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:21,980
I'm gonna stream.

1220
00:43:22,140 --> 00:43:22,940
It's Disney.

1221
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:24,340
It's a Disney fucking game.

1222
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:27,460
Like how much intensive is that gonna be?

1223
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:28,600
It's not gonna be Apex intensive.

1224
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:34,200
I'm not gonna get some fucking frame drops or studies from a goddamn Animal Crossing rip off.

1225
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:35,000
Like...

1226
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:40,040
So...

1227
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:42,120
Oh my god.

1228
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:43,320
This is...

1229
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:47,380
So... anyway.

1230
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:50,660
Anyway.

1231
00:43:53,420 --> 00:43:54,800
Yeah, I boot up YouTube.

1232
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:57,600
I boot up YouTube.

1233
00:43:58,440 --> 00:43:59,900
And I boot up...

1234
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:02,880
Yeah, I was like, why couldn't I load YouTube?

1235
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:05,740
Because I'm an indie, I can say it.

1236
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:08,140
I use... I do use adblocker.

1237
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:11,400
And apparently...

1238
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:14,040
Today of all days...

1239
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:16,420
They figured it out.

1240
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:17,300
They figured...

1241
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:18,960
I think they fucking took it down.

1242
00:44:19,180 --> 00:44:23,120
Because the adblocker extension got like...

1243
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:25,740
fucked up for some reason.

1244
00:44:30,580 --> 00:44:31,220
And...

1245
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:32,960
And they're like, it's...

1246
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:34,800
It is not compatible anymore.

1247
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:36,540
But I didn't realize.

1248
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:37,460
Because I...

1249
00:44:37,460 --> 00:44:38,680
They're like, you gotta disable it.

1250
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:39,860
And I was like, alright, I'll disable it.

1251
00:44:39,980 --> 00:44:41,440
Like, I disabled it.

1252
00:44:41,580 --> 00:44:42,660
And it wouldn't work.

1253
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:44,520
And apparently...

1254
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:48,000
Like, why today of all days?

1255
00:44:48,260 --> 00:44:52,160
For like, the government to send fucking people to their offices.

1256
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:54,180
And unplug their servers.

1257
00:44:55,020 --> 00:44:55,920
Why today?

1258
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:57,020
I don't...

1259
00:44:57,020 --> 00:44:58,220
I'm already going through a lot.

1260
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:00,560
Why did it have to be today?

1261
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:02,280
So...

1262
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:06,820
I found out...

1263
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:09,680
I found out that...

1264
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:11,700
I had to delete my cache.

1265
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:13,860
I had to delete...

1266
00:45:13,860 --> 00:45:16,500
I had to delete my cache.

1267
00:45:16,660 --> 00:45:17,700
For like, today.

1268
00:45:18,020 --> 00:45:19,260
Just today though.

1269
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:23,880
Because whatever happened to that particular adblock...

1270
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:25,780
It like...

1271
00:45:25,780 --> 00:45:28,660
Caused something funky with Chrome.

1272
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,660
So I had to delete the cache for today.

1273
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,560
And then boot it back up.

1274
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:33,660
And I could load stuff again.

1275
00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:35,300
And then I was like, okay.

1276
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:36,700
Maybe that was it.

1277
00:45:39,060 --> 00:45:40,200
Because I was like...

1278
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:41,420
I don't fucking want to get ads.

1279
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:42,360
Like...

1280
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:45,900
I thought that...

1281
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:47,740
Oh, maybe it's just a one time thing.

1282
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:54,860
I just turned it back on after fixing it.

1283
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:55,780
And deleted the cache.

1284
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,660
But then the problem came back.

1285
00:45:58,020 --> 00:45:59,940
The problem came back.

1286
00:45:59,940 --> 00:46:01,180
The problem came back.

1287
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:01,900
And I was like...

1288
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:07,040
The adblock doesn't really work today.

1289
00:46:07,420 --> 00:46:07,980
So...

1290
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:09,220
It's off now.

1291
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:14,100
I was like...

1292
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:15,460
Maybe it's a one time thing.

1293
00:46:15,460 --> 00:46:17,660
I was going through so much today.

1294
00:46:17,860 --> 00:46:18,080
Okay.

1295
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:19,500
I thought maybe...

1296
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:22,100
That one thing would be nice to me.

1297
00:46:22,220 --> 00:46:23,880
Would be kinder to me.

1298
00:46:24,020 --> 00:46:25,300
But apparently not.

1299
00:46:28,740 --> 00:46:30,680
Marina, thank you for the aca-soupa.

1300
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:31,020
Thank you.

1301
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:34,420
Have you tried turning it on and off again?

1302
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:36,280
Thank you for the aca-soupa.

1303
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:37,120
Thank you.

1304
00:46:37,140 --> 00:46:37,500
Thank you.

1305
00:46:38,100 --> 00:46:38,840
That was my day.

1306
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:40,640
My last two days.

1307
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:44,160
That was my last two days.

1308
00:46:44,780 --> 00:46:49,800
It was so fucking...

1309
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:51,500
Oh my god.

1310
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:54,480
I've been through a lot.

1311
00:46:54,700 --> 00:46:57,000
I've been through so much.

1312
00:47:02,020 --> 00:47:02,460
Alright.

1313
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:05,900
Last two days of...

1314
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:06,820
Pure suffering.

1315
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:09,200
By the way.

1316
00:47:09,620 --> 00:47:11,500
So I forgot to tell you guys a story.

1317
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:12,920
Um...

1318
00:47:14,860 --> 00:47:15,860
This other story.

1319
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:17,820
I'll tell this other story while we're at it.

1320
00:47:18,340 --> 00:47:19,400
It's been an hour.

1321
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:21,880
We haven't even played the game yet.

1322
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:24,160
But...

1323
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:26,220
But while I was moving.

1324
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:30,320
I fucked up with booking the elevator for the move.

1325
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:32,560
So I had to call for the move in.

1326
00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:34,320
So I had to call the receptionist.

1327
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:35,420
The concierge.

1328
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:36,580
And I was like...

1329
00:47:38,140 --> 00:47:38,700
Um...

1330
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:41,160
I'm sort of like late.

1331
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:44,960
My overbooking is gonna end in like 10 minutes.

1332
00:47:45,180 --> 00:47:45,780
I know.

1333
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:46,700
I'm so sorry.

1334
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:48,360
There was a delay.

1335
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:49,700
There was no delay.

1336
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:51,940
We were just very inefficient over time.

1337
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:53,020
I was like...

1338
00:47:54,220 --> 00:47:57,700
There was a delay with the movers coming in.

1339
00:47:57,980 --> 00:47:59,140
And like...

1340
00:47:59,140 --> 00:48:00,120
But I'm here.

1341
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:01,400
And I was just wondering...

1342
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:02,480
What do I do?

1343
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:04,420
What do I do in this scenario?

1344
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:05,580
Because like...

1345
00:48:05,580 --> 00:48:06,740
And they're like...

1346
00:48:06,740 --> 00:48:07,560
Sorry ma'am.

1347
00:48:07,620 --> 00:48:10,720
Only one person can move in at this time slot.

1348
00:48:10,860 --> 00:48:14,520
Because we don't have a lot of room for the second truck.

1349
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:15,700
You know the rules.

1350
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:16,800
And I was like...

1351
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:18,000
Oh but like...

1352
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,160
I can't go back.

1353
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:20,720
I paid for the movers.

1354
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:21,700
You're not family.

1355
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:24,160
I paid lots of money for the movers.

1356
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:26,060
I don't know what to do.

1357
00:48:26,060 --> 00:48:27,300
I can't just send them back.

1358
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:28,140
Where do I put my...

1359
00:48:40,860 --> 00:48:45,680
And then they're like...

1360
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:48,580
They're like...

1361
00:48:48,580 --> 00:48:49,520
They're like...

1362
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:49,800
They're like...

1363
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:51,700
Ma 'am I'm sorry but like...

1364
00:48:51,700 --> 00:48:51,960
Uh...

1365
00:48:56,380 --> 00:48:57,020
They're like...

1366
00:48:57,020 --> 00:48:58,360
We're sorry but like...

1367
00:48:58,360 --> 00:48:59,520
You know we can't...

1368
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:01,780
We can't really do anything because...

1369
00:49:01,780 --> 00:49:04,040
We have other people trying to move in too.

1370
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:04,960
Not just you.

1371
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:06,620
No!

1372
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:07,880
Where do I put my...

1373
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:12,290
I can't just you know...

1374
00:49:13,130 --> 00:49:15,950
I can't just...

1375
00:49:15,950 --> 00:49:17,450
Turn the car away.

1376
00:49:20,990 --> 00:49:21,590
So...

1377
00:49:22,270 --> 00:49:23,130
They're like...

1378
00:49:23,130 --> 00:49:25,650
How about you go use the parking lot.

1379
00:49:25,810 --> 00:49:26,050
Okay?

1380
00:49:26,430 --> 00:49:28,790
And you can use any of the elevators.

1381
00:49:28,970 --> 00:49:30,230
We know you have...

1382
00:49:30,230 --> 00:49:31,790
I'm like... Oh thank you.

1383
00:49:32,030 --> 00:49:33,190
I'm sorry again.

1384
00:49:33,290 --> 00:49:34,890
I couldn't turn the movers away.

1385
00:49:35,250 --> 00:49:36,810
Because like... I don't...

1386
00:49:38,130 --> 00:49:40,010
I can't have access to my old place anymore.

1387
00:49:40,310 --> 00:49:42,350
Like literally as I'm streaming at my old place.

1388
00:49:42,830 --> 00:49:43,050
I...

1389
00:49:46,550 --> 00:49:47,870
But it worked!

1390
00:49:48,230 --> 00:49:49,990
I just told a little white lie.

1391
00:49:55,410 --> 00:49:56,450
But it worked.

1392
00:49:56,550 --> 00:49:58,570
And I was able to move in some of my stuff.

1393
00:50:00,870 --> 00:50:01,470
But yeah.

1394
00:50:01,990 --> 00:50:03,390
It's just a little white lie.

1395
00:50:03,390 --> 00:50:04,830
Just a little bit.

1396
00:50:04,830 --> 00:50:06,490
Just a little bit.

1397
00:50:08,530 --> 00:50:10,330
Speak to 100.

1398
00:50:10,750 --> 00:50:11,510
Speak to 100.

1399
00:50:11,510 --> 00:50:12,830
Oh my god.

1400
00:50:12,950 --> 00:50:13,230
Anyway.

1401
00:50:15,750 --> 00:50:17,610
My day has been quite...

1402
00:50:18,290 --> 00:50:19,670
My day has been quite...

1403
00:50:19,670 --> 00:50:20,130
But guys.

1404
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:23,170
I went to Korean BBQ by myself.

1405
00:50:24,830 --> 00:50:25,590
Yesterday.

1406
00:50:29,450 --> 00:50:30,210
Yesterday.

1407
00:50:30,470 --> 00:50:30,610
Yesterday.

1408
00:50:30,610 --> 00:50:34,010
I went to Korean BBQ by myself.

1409
00:50:34,330 --> 00:50:37,030
Because I was going through so much.

1410
00:50:37,470 --> 00:50:38,090
And...

1411
00:50:38,430 --> 00:50:39,410
The thing is.

1412
00:50:39,530 --> 00:50:43,690
Korean BBQ is not a one person thing.

1413
00:50:44,090 --> 00:50:44,870
And so...

1414
00:50:45,430 --> 00:50:46,290
Because I...

1415
00:50:46,290 --> 00:50:47,010
I didn't eat...

1416
00:50:47,010 --> 00:50:48,930
Yesterday I didn't eat lunch guys.

1417
00:50:49,190 --> 00:50:50,130
I didn't eat lunch.

1418
00:50:50,590 --> 00:50:54,330
And I was so sad after everything I've been through.

1419
00:50:55,930 --> 00:50:57,430
So this was like...

1420
00:50:57,430 --> 00:50:58,750
This was like before...

1421
00:50:59,150 --> 00:50:59,690
Actually no.

1422
00:50:59,750 --> 00:51:00,590
This was sort of like a...

1423
00:51:00,610 --> 00:51:01,750
Semi victory thing.

1424
00:51:01,930 --> 00:51:03,570
Because I was like... I got the RAM!

1425
00:51:04,790 --> 00:51:05,230
Yeah!

1426
00:51:06,590 --> 00:51:08,070
So I was like...

1427
00:51:08,070 --> 00:51:08,710
You know.

1428
00:51:08,730 --> 00:51:09,390
Little did I know.

1429
00:51:09,670 --> 00:51:11,610
A lot of things were not going to go my way.

1430
00:51:11,810 --> 00:51:14,030
But I was like... Yesterday I was like... I got the RAM.

1431
00:51:14,290 --> 00:51:14,770
And everything.

1432
00:51:14,970 --> 00:51:16,330
I was like... I was just about to...

1433
00:51:16,330 --> 00:51:18,290
Ready to plug that RAM in.

1434
00:51:18,570 --> 00:51:19,430
Because it's just RAM.

1435
00:51:20,110 --> 00:51:21,250
It's just RAM.

1436
00:51:23,290 --> 00:51:24,330
So I was like...

1437
00:51:24,330 --> 00:51:24,830
Alright.

1438
00:51:24,950 --> 00:51:26,610
I am going...

1439
00:51:26,610 --> 00:51:27,470
To...

1440
00:51:28,230 --> 00:51:30,130
Go to this Korean BBQ place.

1441
00:51:30,610 --> 00:51:30,990
And celebrate!

1442
00:51:31,150 --> 00:51:33,150
And I don't care if I'm eating by myself.

1443
00:51:33,510 --> 00:51:36,010
Like... I'm going to treat myself!

1444
00:51:36,930 --> 00:51:40,390
Because I spent so much money on that fucking Korean BBQ.

1445
00:51:40,710 --> 00:51:42,350
The saddest part.

1446
00:51:42,690 --> 00:51:45,130
The fucking saddest part.

1447
00:51:45,450 --> 00:51:46,550
Was that...

1448
00:51:46,550 --> 00:51:48,550
All their combos...

1449
00:51:48,550 --> 00:51:51,070
And individual orders...

1450
00:51:51,070 --> 00:51:52,770
They were like...

1451
00:51:52,770 --> 00:51:53,450
Sorry.

1452
00:51:53,690 --> 00:51:54,270
I was like...

1453
00:51:54,270 --> 00:51:57,570
Oh for two people, for four people, for six people.

1454
00:51:57,890 --> 00:51:58,690
And then like...

1455
00:51:58,690 --> 00:51:59,650
The individual orders.

1456
00:51:59,810 --> 00:52:00,190
They were like...

1457
00:52:00,610 --> 00:52:00,790
Sorry.

1458
00:52:00,810 --> 00:52:02,150
You have to order at least like...

1459
00:52:02,150 --> 00:52:03,230
Two plates.

1460
00:52:03,610 --> 00:52:05,610
To justify sitting in this spot.

1461
00:52:05,850 --> 00:52:07,210
For the Korean BBQ spot.

1462
00:52:08,650 --> 00:52:09,970
So they were like...

1463
00:52:09,970 --> 00:52:10,910
I was like... Yeah that's fine.

1464
00:52:11,170 --> 00:52:14,050
But each individual plate comes with one bowl of rice.

1465
00:52:14,330 --> 00:52:15,430
So I was just like...

1466
00:52:15,430 --> 00:52:16,690
Well I'll just order a combo.

1467
00:52:17,090 --> 00:52:17,990
I'll just order the combo.

1468
00:52:18,410 --> 00:52:22,470
Because I was like... Well it's more expensive if I order two individual plates.

1469
00:52:22,630 --> 00:52:23,550
Because it comes with two rice.

1470
00:52:23,730 --> 00:52:25,690
Why don't I order combo number two?

1471
00:52:26,030 --> 00:52:27,650
So then... For two people.

1472
00:52:27,650 --> 00:52:28,570
So then I was like...

1473
00:52:28,570 --> 00:52:31,430
Is it possible to half the order?

1474
00:52:31,790 --> 00:52:33,810
Because like I'm one person.

1475
00:52:34,270 --> 00:52:35,190
And they were like... No.

1476
00:52:35,990 --> 00:52:37,450
They were like... No!

1477
00:52:37,850 --> 00:52:39,590
You cannot do that.

1478
00:52:39,790 --> 00:52:41,950
It has to... Like we can't make...

1479
00:52:41,950 --> 00:52:43,830
Adjustments and modifications.

1480
00:52:45,990 --> 00:52:47,290
So I was like...

1481
00:52:47,290 --> 00:52:48,030
Okay.

1482
00:52:50,130 --> 00:52:53,970
I'll order the combo for two please.

1483
00:52:54,110 --> 00:52:57,630
But can you pack up the one bowl of rice?

1484
00:52:57,630 --> 00:52:59,610
Because I thought it would be...

1485
00:52:59,610 --> 00:53:01,590
It would be less sad.

1486
00:53:01,830 --> 00:53:02,370
You know?

1487
00:53:02,530 --> 00:53:02,950
Like...

1488
00:53:04,290 --> 00:53:05,490
I was like...

1489
00:53:05,490 --> 00:53:06,810
I was like...

1490
00:53:06,810 --> 00:53:09,070
I thought it would be less sad.

1491
00:53:09,330 --> 00:53:09,670
You know?

1492
00:53:09,710 --> 00:53:12,170
If like they just box up the second bowl of rice.

1493
00:53:12,450 --> 00:53:13,330
So like...

1494
00:53:13,330 --> 00:53:15,970
It wouldn't make me feel like...

1495
00:53:15,970 --> 00:53:17,050
I'm like...

1496
00:53:17,530 --> 00:53:19,590
Alone eating a combo for two.

1497
00:53:20,550 --> 00:53:21,110
So...

1498
00:53:21,630 --> 00:53:22,190
So...

1499
00:53:22,890 --> 00:53:25,790
Because I haven't had Korean BBQ in so long.

1500
00:53:26,250 --> 00:53:26,970
And I was like...

1501
00:53:27,630 --> 00:53:28,270
I need my new RAM!

1502
00:53:28,510 --> 00:53:30,710
My 64GB RAM!

1503
00:53:31,310 --> 00:53:33,210
And I'm going to celebrate!

1504
00:53:36,110 --> 00:53:37,270
Little didn't I know.

1505
00:53:37,450 --> 00:53:39,370
That was not a celebration dinner.

1506
00:53:39,650 --> 00:53:40,790
That was just...

1507
00:53:40,790 --> 00:53:43,370
That was just the one happy thing before...

1508
00:53:43,370 --> 00:53:44,530
Misery comes in.

1509
00:53:47,410 --> 00:53:48,930
Obviously it was a lot.

1510
00:53:49,110 --> 00:53:50,850
It was a lot of fucking...

1511
00:53:51,970 --> 00:53:52,530
BBQ!

1512
00:53:53,130 --> 00:53:54,930
I was trying to like describe it.

1513
00:53:54,970 --> 00:53:57,450
There was a lot of stuff on the table.

1514
00:53:57,630 --> 00:53:59,990
I would show a picture but it would dox me.

1515
00:54:00,130 --> 00:54:03,150
It would dox like where I am.

1516
00:54:03,310 --> 00:54:04,430
So I was like...

1517
00:54:04,430 --> 00:54:06,150
It was so much.

1518
00:54:06,510 --> 00:54:08,110
And like...

1519
00:54:08,110 --> 00:54:11,390
I ate like... I don't know... 20%?

1520
00:54:11,750 --> 00:54:13,790
Because it was like 2% combo.

1521
00:54:15,090 --> 00:54:16,690
There was so much meat.

1522
00:54:17,330 --> 00:54:18,050
And then...

1523
00:54:18,050 --> 00:54:20,290
I had like...

1524
00:54:20,290 --> 00:54:21,050
A

1525
00:54:24,620 --> 00:54:25,760
giant ass steak!

1526
00:54:25,940 --> 00:54:27,040
Like what the fuck!

1527
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:28,280
And then...

1528
00:54:31,020 --> 00:54:32,020
I was like...

1529
00:54:32,020 --> 00:54:33,080
This is a combo for two?

1530
00:54:34,060 --> 00:54:34,460
Anyway...

1531
00:54:34,460 --> 00:54:35,400
And then there was like...

1532
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:37,000
Jajangmyeon...

1533
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,360
What was it?

1534
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:40,720
The other one.

1535
00:54:40,840 --> 00:54:42,160
The other transparent noodles.

1536
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:43,260
Um...

1537
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:44,900
Um... Fuck!

1538
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:45,900
I forgot what it was called.

1539
00:54:46,100 --> 00:54:47,100
The brown noodles.

1540
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:49,360
I forgot what it was called.

1541
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:51,260
There was that and then there was like...

1542
00:54:51,260 --> 00:54:52,600
There was so much!

1543
00:54:52,700 --> 00:54:54,260
And then there was like those appetizer things.

1544
00:54:54,700 --> 00:54:55,440
And then...

1545
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:56,840
And then there was chop che.

1546
00:54:56,940 --> 00:54:57,760
Yeah there was chop che.

1547
00:54:58,280 --> 00:54:58,980
And then...

1548
00:54:58,980 --> 00:55:01,220
Sorry I like jajangmyeon and chop che.

1549
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:03,220
I like both of this.

1550
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:04,840
I always get them mixed up in my head.

1551
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:06,360
And then there was like...

1552
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:07,800
Those little appetizers!

1553
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:10,460
And then there was like two other...

1554
00:55:10,460 --> 00:55:11,500
There was dumplings!

1555
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:13,660
And there was so much in this combo.

1556
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:15,780
I was like what the fuck is... What's going on?

1557
00:55:16,100 --> 00:55:16,460
And then...

1558
00:55:16,460 --> 00:55:17,640
There was so many.

1559
00:55:17,700 --> 00:55:18,940
There was like two other stuff there.

1560
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:20,160
And then...

1561
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:21,500
For two people.

1562
00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:22,960
For me.

1563
00:55:23,860 --> 00:55:24,620
And then...

1564
00:55:24,620 --> 00:55:27,340
So I was like... I was like... Okay.

1565
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:29,980
Maybe I shouldn't have ordered...

1566
00:55:29,980 --> 00:55:31,580
A combo for two.

1567
00:55:32,180 --> 00:55:32,860
Maybe.

1568
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:34,840
And then there was like...

1569
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:38,020
70% of the food left.

1570
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:38,960
And I was done.

1571
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:39,800
I was done.

1572
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:41,360
I was like...

1573
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:43,900
Can you please go back to the kitchen?

1574
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:45,440
Can you take these raw...

1575
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:48,100
I called a server.

1576
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:49,220
And I was like...

1577
00:55:49,220 --> 00:55:50,320
Could you...

1578
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:53,660
Could you like... please...

1579
00:55:53,660 --> 00:55:56,300
Like cook these raw meat...

1580
00:55:56,300 --> 00:55:57,260
Into the kitchen?

1581
00:55:58,120 --> 00:56:00,480
And like pack it up for me?

1582
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:02,260
Cause there was so much.

1583
00:56:02,460 --> 00:56:03,520
And I was tired.

1584
00:56:03,780 --> 00:56:04,600
I wanted to sleep.

1585
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:07,980
And there was 70% of it left.

1586
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:09,420
And they were like... No.

1587
00:56:09,540 --> 00:56:10,400
You have to cook it yourself.

1588
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:11,160
Like...

1589
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:13,380
I was like... I was so sad.

1590
00:56:13,940 --> 00:56:15,720
I was like...

1591
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:16,520
Okay.

1592
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:20,380
So I just spent like 30 minutes...

1593
00:56:21,020 --> 00:56:22,700
On my table.

1594
00:56:23,180 --> 00:56:24,980
Just cooking the remainder.

1595
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:26,280
But...

1596
00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:27,320
The remainder...

1597
00:56:27,320 --> 00:56:28,220
Of meat.

1598
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:30,300
And like putting it on my plate.

1599
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:32,320
And it was just a mountain of meat.

1600
00:56:32,460 --> 00:56:33,540
On my plate.

1601
00:56:33,820 --> 00:56:34,700
Because I...

1602
00:56:34,700 --> 00:56:38,500
It was just a mountain of meat on my plate.

1603
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:40,500
And I was just like...

1604
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:42,880
And I was just autopilot.

1605
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:44,120
Just cheering like...

1606
00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:46,540
And I like pressed it into the grill.

1607
00:56:46,680 --> 00:56:47,720
Just to make it faster.

1608
00:56:47,860 --> 00:56:48,700
Because I couldn't...

1609
00:56:50,180 --> 00:56:52,520
I couldn't do this anymore.

1610
00:56:53,180 --> 00:56:54,560
I was like...

1611
00:56:56,380 --> 00:56:58,040
I was so tired.

1612
00:56:59,240 --> 00:57:00,140
And then...

1613
00:57:00,140 --> 00:57:01,260
I asked in the box.

1614
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:02,560
And they gave me a box.

1615
00:57:02,660 --> 00:57:03,940
And I just put all the meat in the box.

1616
00:57:04,100 --> 00:57:04,700
And then...

1617
00:57:04,700 --> 00:57:05,840
You know the worst part?

1618
00:57:06,060 --> 00:57:08,160
I forgot to bring the rice.

1619
00:57:08,620 --> 00:57:10,840
I was like...

1620
00:57:15,570 --> 00:57:19,290
I brought in a box full of meat with no rice.

1621
00:57:20,950 --> 00:57:21,470
I

1622
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:27,140
was like...

1623
00:57:27,140 --> 00:57:27,780
The rice.

1624
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,540
They really hit the buzz.

1625
00:57:35,700 --> 00:57:36,380
And I was just like...

1626
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:37,640
The rice.

1627
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:42,120
I was like...

1628
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:43,340
Oh my god.

1629
00:57:43,740 --> 00:57:45,100
Oh my...

1630
00:57:45,100 --> 00:57:49,440
So I spent a lot of money eating Korean barbecue by myself.

1631
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:50,700
So I spent a lot of money eating Korean barbecue by myself.

1632
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:53,620
It was not celebratory dinner.

1633
00:57:53,820 --> 00:57:56,740
It was the last good thing that was going to happen to me.

1634
00:57:58,420 --> 00:57:59,560
For the day.

1635
00:57:59,740 --> 00:58:00,500
For the day.

1636
00:58:01,780 --> 00:58:02,560
So yeah.

1637
00:58:03,380 --> 00:58:04,640
That was my life.

1638
00:58:04,900 --> 00:58:06,220
I told you guys.

1639
00:58:06,460 --> 00:58:07,660
I told you.

1640
00:58:08,180 --> 00:58:13,570
I'm an unlucky person when it comes to tech, when it comes to PC stuff.

1641
00:58:13,990 --> 00:58:17,670
I am literally the most unlucky person when it comes to PC problems.

1642
00:58:17,830 --> 00:58:22,670
Everything that can go wrong when it comes to PC stuff will go wrong for me.

1643
00:58:23,110 --> 00:58:28,150
It never changes and I have to pay for the Uber today to go to the PC store.

1644
00:58:28,430 --> 00:58:30,430
And I have to pay for the Uber to come back.

1645
00:58:36,340 --> 00:58:38,160
What does Rice have to do with a PC?

1646
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:39,240
It's the aftermath.

1647
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:41,520
It's like the little twist, you know?

1648
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:50,180
Like, yes, the PC stuff is the stab in the gut, but the Rice was the twist of the knife.

1649
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:55,300
It didn't have to happen, but it also did.

1650
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:01,300
Alright, let's play this game.

1651
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:06,720
By the way, I don't know if you guys know this, but this game...

1652
00:59:08,680 --> 00:59:09,940
This game is...

1653
00:59:10,580 --> 00:59:11,500
This game is...

1654
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:12,760
This is the main portion of the stream.

1655
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:14,040
So, let's...

1656
00:59:15,420 --> 00:59:19,120
Let's play Disney Dreamlike Valley.

1657
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:20,620
Alright.

1658
00:59:21,020 --> 00:59:24,000
So, for those who don't know, Ursula's Trash...

1659
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,600
I bought the Gold Edition because, like, I don't...

1660
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:28,260
If I...

1661
00:59:28,260 --> 00:59:31,860
I shouldn't have already wasted so much money to...

1662
00:59:31,860 --> 00:59:33,040
I... I don't...

1663
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:35,400
I'm going through so...

1664
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:37,260
Why did I buy the Gold Edition?

1665
00:59:37,260 --> 00:59:39,200
It's not like I'll play it more than once.

1666
00:59:39,560 --> 00:59:41,500
Like, what the fuck is wrong with me?

1667
00:59:41,500 --> 00:59:42,840
Like...

1668
00:59:44,300 --> 00:59:45,900
The Gold Edition...

1669
00:59:45,900 --> 00:59:49,180
Guys, the Gold Edition is only $30 more.

1670
00:59:49,540 --> 00:59:51,180
Like, I can't help it.

1671
00:59:52,600 --> 00:59:55,180
It's only $30 more.

1672
00:59:55,480 --> 00:59:57,340
I never learned.

1673
00:59:57,540 --> 00:59:59,380
Apparently, I just never learned.

1674
00:59:59,940 --> 01:00:00,580
Like...

1675
01:00:02,320 --> 01:00:03,560
I just...

1676
01:00:03,560 --> 01:00:05,120
I just never learned.

1677
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:07,360
Alright.

1678
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:10,840
We'll do a very high...

1679
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:11,300
We're not...

1680
01:00:11,500 --> 01:00:12,940
Alright, let's see.

1681
01:00:13,140 --> 01:00:16,000
I don't even know if Sound Guy's still alive after...

1682
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:17,840
After this.

1683
01:00:18,440 --> 01:00:19,500
After this.

1684
01:00:20,360 --> 01:00:21,000
Alright.

1685
01:00:21,140 --> 01:00:22,800
We're gonna turn down...

1686
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:24,520
We're gonna turn this down.

1687
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:25,340
Streamer-friendly.

1688
01:00:25,560 --> 01:00:27,440
No, get the copyright stuff in.

1689
01:00:27,460 --> 01:00:28,720
I don't fucking care anymore.

1690
01:00:29,260 --> 01:00:33,100
Fucking... I don't need the ad revenue on this one.

1691
01:00:33,780 --> 01:00:35,320
Alright, let's see.

1692
01:00:36,540 --> 01:00:37,180
Alright.

1693
01:00:39,380 --> 01:00:40,320
Here we go.

1694
01:00:40,520 --> 01:00:40,940
Here we go.

1695
01:00:41,500 --> 01:00:43,300
Alright, so for those who don't know...

1696
01:00:43,300 --> 01:00:44,360
This is literally...

1697
01:00:45,360 --> 01:00:47,340
Animal Crossing, but Disney.

1698
01:00:48,060 --> 01:00:48,540
And...

1699
01:00:49,160 --> 01:00:51,360
Expensive... Well, no, it's the same price as Animal Crossing.

1700
01:00:51,540 --> 01:00:53,420
So, like, honestly, they're both, like...

1701
01:00:53,420 --> 01:00:55,660
Way too expensive than what it should be.

1702
01:00:55,880 --> 01:00:56,860
But, like...

1703
01:00:56,860 --> 01:00:58,040
Alright, who do I wanna be?

1704
01:00:58,420 --> 01:00:59,620
Import an avatar?

1705
01:01:00,780 --> 01:01:02,540
Guys, make me write...

1706
01:01:05,460 --> 01:01:06,720
No, I'm joking.

1707
01:01:06,940 --> 01:01:07,240
Alright.

1708
01:01:08,060 --> 01:01:08,540
Let's...

1709
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:10,820
Can I customize?

1710
01:01:11,500 --> 01:01:12,060
Alright, edit.

1711
01:01:12,660 --> 01:01:13,560
You know what?

1712
01:01:13,640 --> 01:01:14,620
No, I'm gonna make you guys.

1713
01:01:15,240 --> 01:01:16,540
I'm not gonna make me.

1714
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:17,460
I'm gonna make you guys.

1715
01:01:17,800 --> 01:01:19,540
Alright, what's the closest?

1716
01:01:22,360 --> 01:01:22,960
Umm...

1717
01:01:24,120 --> 01:01:24,720
Umm...

1718
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:26,420
I'll start with, like, a male avatar.

1719
01:01:26,860 --> 01:01:27,440
Alright.

1720
01:01:28,260 --> 01:01:29,800
Let's see...

1721
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:32,840
That's... Yeah, that's about right.

1722
01:01:35,420 --> 01:01:37,220
What the fuck?

1723
01:01:38,540 --> 01:01:40,020
What the fuck?

1724
01:01:41,500 --> 01:01:42,300
There's no shit there!

1725
01:01:42,540 --> 01:01:44,540
What is there?

1726
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:45,940
What is there?

1727
01:01:45,980 --> 01:01:46,840
The fucking...

1728
01:01:47,320 --> 01:01:49,440
What's the name of Sasuke's fucking brother?

1729
01:01:52,200 --> 01:01:52,840
Alright.

1730
01:01:53,080 --> 01:01:54,240
We'll get Disney eyes.

1731
01:01:54,620 --> 01:01:55,340
What's this?

1732
01:01:55,640 --> 01:01:56,280
Oh, colors!

1733
01:01:57,740 --> 01:01:59,360
Kinda... Oh my god!

1734
01:01:59,780 --> 01:02:02,440
Oh my god, you're gonna be...

1735
01:02:03,300 --> 01:02:04,980
Reptile... You're gonna be the...

1736
01:02:04,980 --> 01:02:05,680
Reptile man.

1737
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:07,200
Secret society.

1738
01:02:09,140 --> 01:02:10,980
This guy... What do you mean?

1739
01:02:11,500 --> 01:02:12,580
He's definitely a dragoon.

1740
01:02:13,080 --> 01:02:14,440
Alright, the secret...

1741
01:02:16,900 --> 01:02:18,740
Alright, let's see... Wait, what's this?

1742
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:20,760
What does this change?

1743
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:21,420
Oh, eyeshadow?

1744
01:02:24,260 --> 01:02:25,140
Let's see...

1745
01:02:25,140 --> 01:02:26,060
You're gonna be lizardman.

1746
01:02:27,820 --> 01:02:29,040
Oh, wait, okay.

1747
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:30,100
We're gonna be lizardman.

1748
01:02:30,140 --> 01:02:30,720
The secret society.

1749
01:02:31,480 --> 01:02:32,080
What's this?

1750
01:02:32,080 --> 01:02:32,160
What's this?

1751
01:02:39,380 --> 01:02:40,420
What's this?

1752
01:02:40,420 --> 01:02:41,420
The Luminati.

1753
01:02:41,540 --> 01:02:42,100
I knew it!

1754
01:02:42,180 --> 01:02:44,420
I fucking knew the Luminati was real!

1755
01:02:44,700 --> 01:02:45,580
Oh, these eyebrows?

1756
01:02:46,020 --> 01:02:46,540
Okay.

1757
01:02:49,080 --> 01:02:49,600
Alright.

1758
01:02:49,860 --> 01:02:51,880
I'm gonna make the most lizard possible.

1759
01:02:52,440 --> 01:02:54,080
I guess that's pretty lizard-y.

1760
01:02:55,980 --> 01:02:58,640
Okay, I think the black eyebrows really sell it.

1761
01:02:58,640 --> 01:02:59,260
But...

1762
01:03:01,640 --> 01:03:02,240
Alright.

1763
01:03:04,520 --> 01:03:05,980
Ooh, the sharp nose.

1764
01:03:06,140 --> 01:03:06,480
Yes!

1765
01:03:07,420 --> 01:03:08,020
Yes!

1766
01:03:08,380 --> 01:03:09,160
The lizardman!

1767
01:03:10,180 --> 01:03:10,780
Ha!

1768
01:03:10,940 --> 01:03:11,400
Okay.

1769
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:15,640
Oh, yes!

1770
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:17,480
Yes, okay.

1771
01:03:17,600 --> 01:03:18,140
I like that.

1772
01:03:19,040 --> 01:03:20,740
Uh... What color is this?

1773
01:03:21,380 --> 01:03:21,980
Uh...

1774
01:03:22,420 --> 01:03:22,720
Green?

1775
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:25,700
Where the fuck is the green from?

1776
01:03:26,020 --> 01:03:26,620
Whatever.

1777
01:03:27,120 --> 01:03:27,860
What's this?

1778
01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:28,740
Oh!

1779
01:03:29,040 --> 01:03:29,420
Oh!

1780
01:03:29,500 --> 01:03:30,940
That's what the green's from!

1781
01:03:31,140 --> 01:03:31,400
Oh!

1782
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:32,120
Okay.

1783
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:35,420
Okay, I realize what the green is from.

1784
01:03:36,780 --> 01:03:37,300
Alright.

1785
01:03:39,080 --> 01:03:40,440
Alright, then I guess like...

1786
01:03:40,440 --> 01:03:41,780
I want it to be darker green then.

1787
01:03:42,600 --> 01:03:43,420
There you go.

1788
01:03:47,670 --> 01:03:48,710
Mmm... Maybe...

1789
01:03:48,710 --> 01:03:49,410
Oh, wait.

1790
01:03:49,770 --> 01:03:50,290
Maybe...

1791
01:03:51,850 --> 01:03:52,370
What?

1792
01:03:52,410 --> 01:03:53,850
You're seeing lizardman.

1793
01:03:55,250 --> 01:03:56,130
Secret society!

1794
01:03:56,410 --> 01:03:57,230
Don't you know?

1795
01:03:57,990 --> 01:04:00,270
The country's run by... The world is run by...

1796
01:04:00,290 --> 01:04:02,210
The lizard people!

1797
01:04:02,910 --> 01:04:04,110
Did you know that?

1798
01:04:04,790 --> 01:04:06,410
I fucking knew it!

1799
01:04:06,470 --> 01:04:07,810
I fucking knew it!

1800
01:04:08,190 --> 01:04:09,110
Alright, jaw.

1801
01:04:11,030 --> 01:04:11,670
Okay.

1802
01:04:12,510 --> 01:04:14,230
Uh... I need to like...

1803
01:04:14,230 --> 01:04:15,730
I need to get more lizard-y.

1804
01:04:15,990 --> 01:04:17,230
I guess like that?

1805
01:04:17,510 --> 01:04:17,790
Yeah.

1806
01:04:18,030 --> 01:04:18,830
There we go.

1807
01:04:19,070 --> 01:04:20,370
And then...

1808
01:04:21,150 --> 01:04:21,790
Birthmarks?

1809
01:04:22,650 --> 01:04:23,290
Freckles?

1810
01:04:23,650 --> 01:04:24,110
Or...

1811
01:04:24,110 --> 01:04:25,570
Do lizards have freckles?

1812
01:04:25,970 --> 01:04:26,610
Do!

1813
01:04:27,310 --> 01:04:27,950
Hahaha!

1814
01:04:30,650 --> 01:04:31,530
Do lizards...

1815
01:04:31,530 --> 01:04:32,790
This is a good question.

1816
01:04:32,870 --> 01:04:34,870
Sorry, I haven't seen a lot of lizards in a long time.

1817
01:04:35,110 --> 01:04:37,390
But do lizards have freckles?

1818
01:04:39,630 --> 01:04:40,350
Not really.

1819
01:04:40,990 --> 01:04:41,710
Some do.

1820
01:04:42,110 --> 01:04:42,990
Nah, that's not.

1821
01:04:44,710 --> 01:04:45,290
That's not.

1822
01:04:45,330 --> 01:04:46,370
You guys already run the world.

1823
01:04:46,470 --> 01:04:48,010
You don't need like more...

1824
01:04:48,010 --> 01:04:48,710
Alright.

1825
01:04:48,850 --> 01:04:49,650
What's this hair?

1826
01:04:51,490 --> 01:04:51,930
Uhhh...

1827
01:04:51,930 --> 01:04:52,650
Oh my god.

1828
01:04:52,690 --> 01:04:54,030
This is like some fucking...

1829
01:04:54,030 --> 01:04:55,210
That is a Disney God.

1830
01:04:55,390 --> 01:04:55,810
Hahaha!

1831
01:04:57,590 --> 01:04:58,030
Fucking...

1832
01:04:58,030 --> 01:04:58,590
Oh, bug!

1833
01:04:59,090 --> 01:04:59,530
Oh!

1834
01:05:01,070 --> 01:05:01,630
Okay.

1835
01:05:01,890 --> 01:05:02,710
Let's see.

1836
01:05:05,530 --> 01:05:07,850
I could just make you Jeff Bezos.

1837
01:05:07,930 --> 01:05:08,390
You know what?

1838
01:05:08,450 --> 01:05:09,150
You're Jeff Bezos.

1839
01:05:09,850 --> 01:05:10,410
Hahaha!

1840
01:05:11,610 --> 01:05:11,930
Hahaha!

1841
01:05:12,890 --> 01:05:13,450
Hahaha!

1842
01:05:18,280 --> 01:05:21,200
You're just Jeff Bezos at this point.

1843
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:22,380
Yeah, alright.

1844
01:05:23,820 --> 01:05:24,380
Hahaha!

1845
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:27,200
I've never done anything like that.

1846
01:05:27,240 --> 01:05:28,260
What do you mean?

1847
01:05:29,880 --> 01:05:31,000
Jeffrey Bezos.

1848
01:05:32,140 --> 01:05:32,320
Hahaha!

1849
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:36,460
Become one with the Bezos.

1850
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:37,020
Alright.

1851
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:38,740
I mean, he's like some...

1852
01:05:38,740 --> 01:05:41,420
I mean, he has been working up since he's divorced his wife.

1853
01:05:41,720 --> 01:05:44,980
So, like, he is going through a midlife crisis at the moment.

1854
01:05:45,060 --> 01:05:46,160
So, I'll give him...

1855
01:05:46,160 --> 01:05:47,920
I'll give him, like...

1856
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:48,680
You know what?

1857
01:05:49,660 --> 01:05:51,660
He's starting to get...

1858
01:05:52,280 --> 01:05:52,740
Yeah.

1859
01:05:53,540 --> 01:05:54,260
I don't know.

1860
01:05:54,320 --> 01:05:55,160
Should I be nice to...

1861
01:05:55,160 --> 01:05:56,800
I mean, Jeff Bezos, you're a fucking billionaire.

1862
01:05:56,900 --> 01:05:59,520
You don't need a muscular body.

1863
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:00,920
Alright, face paint.

1864
01:06:00,980 --> 01:06:01,660
What the fuck?

1865
01:06:02,600 --> 01:06:03,840
What are these?

1866
01:06:05,300 --> 01:06:06,120
What are...

1867
01:06:06,760 --> 01:06:08,260
What is this?

1868
01:06:08,620 --> 01:06:09,940
What is this?

1869
01:06:11,180 --> 01:06:11,740
Hahaha!

1870
01:06:12,560 --> 01:06:13,440
He's divorced?

1871
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:14,180
Yes!

1872
01:06:14,520 --> 01:06:14,840
Yes!

1873
01:06:15,600 --> 01:06:18,060
His wife took, like, half of everything!

1874
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:21,560
Alright.

1875
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,940
You could have gotten the easy route and make us look like Zucker...

1876
01:06:24,940 --> 01:06:26,500
Yeah, but there's no Zuckerberg hair.

1877
01:06:26,680 --> 01:06:27,720
It's easier to just make...

1878
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:29,760
a lizard man.

1879
01:06:30,120 --> 01:06:32,760
But, like, nobody ever talks about Bezos, though.

1880
01:06:33,980 --> 01:06:34,440
Ooh.

1881
01:06:35,240 --> 01:06:36,180
Ho ho ho!

1882
01:06:36,360 --> 01:06:37,300
That's not Bezos!

1883
01:06:37,700 --> 01:06:38,740
That's fucking...

1884
01:06:38,740 --> 01:06:39,360
Hahaha!

1885
01:06:40,440 --> 01:06:41,400
That's Mezos!

1886
01:06:42,340 --> 01:06:43,640
Okay, let's see.

1887
01:06:44,360 --> 01:06:44,960
Alright.

1888
01:06:45,140 --> 01:06:46,120
I think that's great.

1889
01:06:46,600 --> 01:06:47,600
Alright, Bezos.

1890
01:06:47,880 --> 01:06:49,520
Welcome to my Disney World.

1891
01:06:49,860 --> 01:06:52,980
This white chat thing is pissing me off.

1892
01:06:53,060 --> 01:06:53,420
I'm gonna...

1893
01:06:53,420 --> 01:06:53,940
Hahaha!

1894
01:06:54,280 --> 01:06:55,180
I'm already going...

1895
01:06:55,180 --> 01:06:56,000
I mean...

1896
01:06:56,000 --> 01:07:01,480
If it doesn't fix itself, if the CS does not fix itself... Okay, it does not.

1897
01:07:01,660 --> 01:07:02,140
Alright!

1898
01:07:02,600 --> 01:07:04,060
I'm gonna do something crazy.

1899
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:09,300
You're only gonna see two of you guys talk.

1900
01:07:09,680 --> 01:07:10,260
Hahaha!

1901
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:14,600
Alright.

1902
01:07:15,020 --> 01:07:16,540
It should be long... Okay.

1903
01:07:17,860 --> 01:07:18,460
Jeffrey...

1904
01:07:20,120 --> 01:07:20,720
Bezos...

1905
01:07:21,620 --> 01:07:22,220
Bezo?

1906
01:07:22,460 --> 01:07:22,980
Okay.

1907
01:07:23,160 --> 01:07:23,580
Haha!

1908
01:07:23,820 --> 01:07:24,880
Jeff... Alright.

1909
01:07:25,020 --> 01:07:26,300
We call him Jeff here.

1910
01:07:26,340 --> 01:07:27,120
Jeff Bezos.

1911
01:07:27,840 --> 01:07:28,700
There we go.

1912
01:07:29,480 --> 01:07:30,820
I'm on the...

1913
01:07:30,820 --> 01:07:32,980
I'm getting sexier.

1914
01:07:33,300 --> 01:07:33,940
Alright.

1915
01:07:34,340 --> 01:07:35,760
Jeff Bezos.

1916
01:07:36,860 --> 01:07:38,420
I think that's how... I mean...

1917
01:07:38,420 --> 01:07:41,700
How... There's no way I could fuck up spelling his name.

1918
01:07:41,980 --> 01:07:42,760
There's no way.

1919
01:07:44,180 --> 01:07:44,820
Jeffy...

1920
01:07:44,820 --> 01:07:46,480
Jeffy... My...

1921
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:48,280
My friend Jeffy...

1922
01:07:48,280 --> 01:07:49,300
Bezos...

1923
01:07:50,940 --> 01:07:51,580
Okay.

1924
01:07:51,660 --> 01:07:52,720
Now I need to spell check.

1925
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:54,660
Now I'm fucking paranoid.

1926
01:07:55,140 --> 01:07:55,540
Alright.

1927
01:07:55,620 --> 01:07:56,400
Jeff Bezos.

1928
01:07:56,520 --> 01:07:56,780
Okay.

1929
01:07:56,840 --> 01:07:57,100
Good.

1930
01:07:57,220 --> 01:07:58,280
I was actually paranoid.

1931
01:07:58,700 --> 01:07:59,400
I guess she spelled it wrong.

1932
01:08:00,260 --> 01:08:02,420
It's like there's no way I could fuck that up.

1933
01:08:02,500 --> 01:08:04,140
I've already fucked up a lot of stuff.

1934
01:08:04,420 --> 01:08:05,920
So... Jeff Bezos.

1935
01:08:06,600 --> 01:08:07,120
Alright.

1936
01:08:07,220 --> 01:08:08,160
Welcome to Disneyland!

1937
01:08:11,460 --> 01:08:12,240
Welcome to...

1938
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:13,760
Disney Crossing.

1939
01:08:22,240 --> 01:08:24,440
After she... After Doki...

1940
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:28,600
was at her breaking point, she fucking finally moved out of the city.

1941
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:35,980
It's time to create the Disney Warehouse.

1942
01:08:43,210 --> 01:08:44,760
Jeffery Bezos has a childhood?

1943
01:08:55,780 --> 01:08:58,740
You can have that in the lizard society?

1944
01:09:06,080 --> 01:09:07,500
Jeff was a child?

1945
01:09:07,500 --> 01:09:11,840
He didn't... He didn't come out of the womb as a fucking 40 year old man?

1946
01:09:14,740 --> 01:09:16,860
He wasn't born at age 40?

1947
01:09:17,240 --> 01:09:17,760
He wasn't born at age 40?

1948
01:09:17,760 --> 01:09:18,620
Holy shit.

1949
01:09:21,360 --> 01:09:21,920
Yeah.

1950
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:23,580
The lizard people don't sleep.

1951
01:09:23,700 --> 01:09:24,460
What is this?

1952
01:09:29,880 --> 01:09:32,420
He spawned in when Amazon came out.

1953
01:09:32,480 --> 01:09:32,980
Oh hey Berlin!

1954
01:09:36,340 --> 01:09:37,800
Oh my voice acted.

1955
01:09:38,040 --> 01:09:38,600
I love that.

1956
01:09:39,440 --> 01:09:40,440
Less reading.

1957
01:09:40,740 --> 01:09:42,560
And then the voice acting is just...

1958
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:42,840
Oh...

1959
01:09:42,840 --> 01:09:43,600
Oh...

1960
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:44,100
Oh...

1961
01:09:44,100 --> 01:09:44,700
Oh...

1962
01:09:56,840 --> 01:09:57,480
Oh...

1963
01:09:57,480 --> 01:09:57,600
Oh...

1964
01:10:04,820 --> 01:10:05,460
Oh...

1965
01:10:05,460 --> 01:10:16,120
Of course I'm...

1966
01:10:16,120 --> 01:10:17,960
On my spectacles and chatter.

1967
01:10:18,060 --> 01:10:19,760
Of course I'm real.

1968
01:10:20,020 --> 01:10:21,080
Jeff Bezos.

1969
01:10:23,620 --> 01:10:26,500
I can never be too sure around here.

1970
01:10:27,940 --> 01:10:29,500
I'm afraid you'll have to excuse me.

1971
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:30,740
I haven't met anyone in ages.

1972
01:10:31,820 --> 01:10:34,640
And welcome to Dreamlight Valley my friend.

1973
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:36,560
Dreamlight Valley?

1974
01:10:36,720 --> 01:10:37,980
This place is...

1975
01:10:38,700 --> 01:10:39,660
Sort of creepy.

1976
01:10:39,860 --> 01:10:40,740
Sort of creepy.

1977
01:10:42,120 --> 01:10:43,440
Lolly thank you for the super chat.

1978
01:10:43,540 --> 01:10:43,740
Thank you.

1979
01:10:45,440 --> 01:10:47,880
Can I get a couple days late happy birthday?

1980
01:10:47,900 --> 01:10:48,140
Of course!

1981
01:10:48,520 --> 01:10:50,200
Happy birthday to you.

1982
01:10:50,440 --> 01:10:52,280
Happy birthday to you.

1983
01:10:52,380 --> 01:10:52,860
Happy birthday to you.

1984
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:54,320
Happy birthday dear Lolly.

1985
01:10:54,600 --> 01:10:56,060
Happy birthday to you.

1986
01:10:56,200 --> 01:10:56,400
Yeah!

1987
01:11:00,280 --> 01:11:03,080
Once upon a time you couldn't find another realm.

1988
01:11:03,160 --> 01:11:05,000
With as much magic and wonder in it.

1989
01:11:05,420 --> 01:11:07,700
Oh but I haven't introduced myself yet.

1990
01:11:07,980 --> 01:11:09,920
You're no doubt wondering who I am.

1991
01:11:11,460 --> 01:11:12,580
You're Merlin.

1992
01:11:13,100 --> 01:11:14,180
You're very old.

1993
01:11:14,440 --> 01:11:16,260
You're a very odd old man.

1994
01:11:17,020 --> 01:11:17,720
That's right.

1995
01:11:17,880 --> 01:11:18,800
Odd old man.

1996
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:19,720
Why I'm...

1997
01:11:19,720 --> 01:11:20,700
I'm Merlin.

1998
01:11:20,980 --> 01:11:21,880
I'll have you know.

1999
01:11:21,880 --> 01:11:23,260
I'm a wizard.

2000
01:11:23,420 --> 01:11:25,100
A very very powerful wizard.

2001
01:11:25,540 --> 01:11:27,220
And that's... if you're so powerful.

2002
01:11:27,340 --> 01:11:28,520
Why are there foreigners everywhere?

2003
01:11:30,040 --> 01:11:31,560
I'm a soothsayer.

2004
01:11:31,780 --> 01:11:33,800
A prognosticator.

2005
01:11:34,020 --> 01:11:36,440
I have the power to see into the future.

2006
01:11:36,860 --> 01:11:39,720
And I'm also quite skilled at alchemy and...

2007
01:11:39,720 --> 01:11:39,880
And I'm also quite skilled at alchemy and...

2008
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:42,160
...precedicular action.

2009
01:11:42,680 --> 01:11:44,000
Now that that's settled.

2010
01:11:44,220 --> 01:11:46,280
There's a small matter of who you are.

2011
01:11:46,480 --> 01:11:47,620
You don't know who I am?

2012
01:11:48,540 --> 01:11:49,860
I'm Jeff Bezos.

2013
01:11:50,280 --> 01:11:51,060
Jeff Bezos.

2014
01:11:51,880 --> 01:11:52,700
Jeff Bezos.

2015
01:11:53,580 --> 01:11:54,920
Jeff Bezos?

2016
01:11:55,260 --> 01:11:58,440
Well the only way to get to Dreamlike Valley...

2017
01:11:58,440 --> 01:12:00,180
...is to pass through dreams.

2018
01:12:00,680 --> 01:12:02,100
So you must also possess...

2019
01:12:02,460 --> 01:12:03,620
...great magic.

2020
01:12:04,440 --> 01:12:05,120
Otherwise...

2021
01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:06,400
...how could you be here?

2022
01:12:06,740 --> 01:12:08,180
Amazon money bro!

2023
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:12,960
Oh yes.

2024
01:12:13,540 --> 01:12:14,700
Great magic.

2025
01:12:14,820 --> 01:12:16,200
Better watch out Merlin.

2026
01:12:16,360 --> 01:12:18,400
I'm pretty good at magic myself.

2027
01:12:19,160 --> 01:12:20,380
You're not the only...

2028
01:12:20,380 --> 01:12:21,240
...soothslayer.

2029
01:12:21,660 --> 01:12:23,100
Whatever that shit is.

2030
01:12:24,500 --> 01:12:25,760
I knew it.

2031
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:26,900
The power of money.

2032
01:12:27,360 --> 01:12:29,460
As you say, could be magic too.

2033
01:12:31,900 --> 01:12:32,940
In fact...

2034
01:12:32,940 --> 01:12:34,320
...I'm quite certain that you're...

2035
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:35,420
...the one we've been waiting for.

2036
01:12:35,500 --> 01:12:37,420
You're gonna save Dreamlike Valley.

2037
01:12:38,480 --> 01:12:39,420
Oh my god.

2038
01:12:39,540 --> 01:12:40,500
What's in it for me?

2039
01:12:40,940 --> 01:12:43,720
Why all the joys of Dreamlike Valley of course.

2040
01:12:45,300 --> 01:12:46,400
If we are to...

2041
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:48,360
...restore the valley to what it was...

2042
01:12:48,360 --> 01:12:50,020
...a place of magic...

2043
01:12:50,020 --> 01:12:51,480
...of wonder, of friendship...

2044
01:12:51,480 --> 01:12:55,000
...we need to stop the forgetting once and for all.

2045
01:12:55,740 --> 01:12:56,720
We must!

2046
01:12:57,240 --> 01:12:58,200
We must!

2047
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:00,320
I'm sorry.

2048
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:02,200
I can't seem to remember what we were talking about.

2049
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:03,460
Oh they're starting to forget!

2050
01:13:04,280 --> 01:13:05,500
Merlin's the forgetting?

2051
01:13:06,620 --> 01:13:07,580
You can't forget.

2052
01:13:07,680 --> 01:13:08,920
I haven't bought Disney yet.

2053
01:13:10,540 --> 01:13:11,520
Ah yes.

2054
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:12,740
The forgetting.

2055
01:13:12,740 --> 01:13:14,720
I haven't bought Disney with my...

2056
01:13:14,720 --> 01:13:15,860
...the boys money!

2057
01:13:16,180 --> 01:13:17,600
And has been hotel money!

2058
01:13:18,500 --> 01:13:20,920
You have to forgive me.

2059
01:13:21,060 --> 01:13:23,140
Now you can see where it gets its name.

2060
01:13:23,520 --> 01:13:24,240
You forgot.

2061
01:13:25,180 --> 01:13:25,820
Alright.

2062
01:13:25,980 --> 01:13:27,140
Listen closely.

2063
01:13:27,420 --> 01:13:30,020
I'll tell you the tale before I forget again.

2064
01:13:30,420 --> 01:13:31,100
He has dementia?

2065
01:13:31,460 --> 01:13:33,680
I mean, he's really fucking old.

2066
01:13:33,980 --> 01:13:34,920
So I won't...

2067
01:13:34,920 --> 01:13:35,260
...

2068
01:13:35,260 --> 01:13:35,340
...

2069
01:13:35,340 --> 01:13:36,380
...

2070
01:13:42,740 --> 01:13:44,660
Thanks to our ruler's magic.

2071
01:13:45,380 --> 01:13:47,740
Until our ruler vanished...

2072
01:13:47,740 --> 01:13:48,880
Wait, who ruled the land?

2073
01:13:49,680 --> 01:13:51,200
Our memories faded.

2074
01:13:51,380 --> 01:13:53,560
The valley became a shadow of itself.

2075
01:13:54,380 --> 01:13:58,140
We tried to save our memories of the life that it be.

2076
01:13:58,360 --> 01:13:59,100
We tried to save our memories of the life that it be.

2077
01:13:59,100 --> 01:13:59,380
We tried to save our memories of the life that it be.

2078
01:13:59,380 --> 01:14:00,540
Oh my god there's so many thorns!

2079
01:14:02,100 --> 01:14:07,520
And as I can see into the future, I knew that someday, someone will come help to restore the valley.

2080
01:14:08,180 --> 01:14:08,740
No!

2081
01:14:09,640 --> 01:14:10,200
Scrooge!

2082
01:14:10,200 --> 01:14:12,680
He found out Bezos was gonna show up!

2083
01:14:12,740 --> 01:14:14,000
And he won't be the richest...

2084
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,520
The richest citizen in this valley!

2085
01:14:18,460 --> 01:14:20,280
I wanna know about the missing ruler.

2086
01:14:21,080 --> 01:14:22,280
It was Sora.

2087
01:14:23,220 --> 01:14:28,500
Well now, all the wonder, magic, and friendship in this valley came from our...

2088
01:14:28,500 --> 01:14:29,280
Friendship?

2089
01:14:29,400 --> 01:14:31,320
You can be friends with other people!

2090
01:14:32,100 --> 01:14:34,840
What do you mean friendship came from our ruler?

2091
01:14:35,100 --> 01:14:38,480
Was he like the one mutual friend that united everybody?

2092
01:14:38,860 --> 01:14:42,980
Like, they watched over the village and kept us safe from dark magic.

2093
01:14:43,100 --> 01:14:44,240
You're literally a magician!

2094
01:14:45,080 --> 01:14:47,080
What's the point of having a magician?

2095
01:14:50,720 --> 01:14:54,140
But one day, they started to act different.

2096
01:14:54,400 --> 01:14:57,440
Though I can scarcely remember it now.

2097
01:14:58,020 --> 01:15:00,140
And then our ruler simply...

2098
01:15:00,740 --> 01:15:01,200
vanished.

2099
01:15:02,500 --> 01:15:04,960
It's been years, I think.

2100
01:15:05,060 --> 01:15:08,440
I lost all track of time because of the forgetting.

2101
01:15:09,360 --> 01:15:11,080
Your ruler just...

2102
01:15:11,080 --> 01:15:12,440
up and left?

2103
01:15:12,740 --> 01:15:15,840
Doesn't sound like a great ruler, not gonna lie.

2104
01:15:16,920 --> 01:15:20,220
A good ruler would take care of the village and its people.

2105
01:15:20,380 --> 01:15:21,640
Not just run away.

2106
01:15:21,960 --> 01:15:23,700
I mean look at my Amazon warehouse!

2107
01:15:25,020 --> 01:15:25,580
Oh.

2108
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:27,240
Our ruler...

2109
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:28,400
was...

2110
01:15:28,400 --> 01:15:30,620
He's still the richest...

2111
01:15:31,440 --> 01:15:32,000
Sorry.

2112
01:15:32,660 --> 01:15:34,880
He's the richest lizard here.

2113
01:15:37,780 --> 01:15:38,340
Alright.

2114
01:15:38,460 --> 01:15:40,380
I'm ready to help restore the valley.

2115
01:15:40,780 --> 01:15:43,940
There's an option that was like, tell me more about the forgetting.

2116
01:15:44,180 --> 01:15:46,800
And I'm like, bro, people are literally forgetting!

2117
01:15:47,280 --> 01:15:49,440
Like, what do I need to know more about it?

2118
01:15:50,700 --> 01:15:56,680
Well, there's only one way to be absolutely certain you're the one destined to save Dreamlike Valley from the forgetting.

2119
01:15:57,200 --> 01:15:59,500
It'll be a small test of your magic!

2120
01:16:00,280 --> 01:16:05,460
You see, ever since the forgetting, I've been puzzled about this house blocked by the night thorns.

2121
01:16:05,940 --> 01:16:06,560
Come along!

2122
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:08,240
We'll investigate it together!

2123
01:16:09,140 --> 01:16:09,700
Alright.

2124
01:16:09,820 --> 01:16:12,320
Left click or E to interact with your surroundings.

2125
01:16:16,590 --> 01:16:17,070
Alright.

2126
01:16:17,830 --> 01:16:21,030
I need a apparently... well, oh god, I need to turn down...

2127
01:16:21,030 --> 01:16:21,270
Whoa!

2128
01:16:21,650 --> 01:16:22,830
Oh, they screwed you, Mickey!

2129
01:16:23,770 --> 01:16:24,510
My god!

2130
01:16:24,590 --> 01:16:27,270
I got to re-meet the richest duck in the world!

2131
01:16:27,690 --> 01:16:30,350
Alright, let me turn down the music.

2132
01:16:30,750 --> 01:16:36,270
And then... I need to turn down the sense, cause the sense- sensitivity is insane.

2133
01:16:36,650 --> 01:16:40,210
And turn up the game a little bit.

2134
01:16:40,390 --> 01:16:40,610
Alright.

2135
01:16:41,430 --> 01:16:42,730
That should be good.

2136
01:16:42,850 --> 01:16:44,610
Let me know, sound guy, if everything's good.

2137
01:16:44,850 --> 01:16:45,690
Well, okay.

2138
01:16:46,170 --> 01:16:47,510
Everything's not good for me.

2139
01:16:47,570 --> 01:16:48,910
The sense is still fucking...

2140
01:16:48,910 --> 01:16:49,190
Whoa!

2141
01:16:49,510 --> 01:16:50,830
How is the sense still...

2142
01:16:51,690 --> 01:16:52,210
insane?

2143
01:16:52,690 --> 01:16:54,510
I don't understand!

2144
01:16:55,630 --> 01:16:56,150
Alright.

2145
01:16:56,610 --> 01:16:57,130
Alright.

2146
01:16:57,190 --> 01:16:58,390
Try to enter the house.

2147
01:16:59,750 --> 01:17:05,850
I've consulted my notes and discovered that night thorns began infesting Dreamlike Valley soon after a ruler disappeared.

2148
01:17:06,230 --> 01:17:09,310
No one, not even I, can remove the blasted things.

2149
01:17:09,910 --> 01:17:13,590
Only someone who can harness the magic of Dreamlike Valley will be able to.

2150
01:17:15,270 --> 01:17:17,090
And I'm sure not someone is...

2151
01:17:18,410 --> 01:17:20,550
Is you, Jeff Bezos!

2152
01:17:21,270 --> 01:17:22,290
I can't.

2153
01:17:22,470 --> 01:17:24,210
It always hits me.

2154
01:17:25,450 --> 01:17:29,130
Now for a test of your magic, time to bring out the wallet.

2155
01:17:29,970 --> 01:17:31,350
I mean wand.

2156
01:17:31,610 --> 01:17:33,110
Peter, thank you for the super chat.

2157
01:17:33,250 --> 01:17:33,590
Thank you.

2158
01:17:33,590 --> 01:17:34,210
Thank you.

2159
01:17:35,810 --> 01:17:36,710
Of course!

2160
01:17:36,810 --> 01:17:38,690
Why else would I be here?

2161
01:17:39,210 --> 01:17:42,270
Well then, don't let me get in your way.

2162
01:17:42,850 --> 01:17:45,830
Now focus your thoughts on the night thorns.

2163
01:17:47,170 --> 01:17:49,270
That sounds too easy.

2164
01:17:49,910 --> 01:17:51,130
Perhaps it is.

2165
01:17:51,330 --> 01:17:53,530
Or perhaps it's the hardest thing you've ever done.

2166
01:17:53,850 --> 01:17:56,010
Only one way to find out.

2167
01:17:57,250 --> 01:18:00,870
Feel the magic within yourself and say the magic word.

2168
01:18:03,210 --> 01:18:03,890
Um...

2169
01:18:03,890 --> 01:18:05,190
Bippity boppity boo!

2170
01:18:06,530 --> 01:18:09,130
The fairy godmother's magical phrase?

2171
01:18:09,470 --> 01:18:10,310
Wise choice.

2172
01:18:11,790 --> 01:18:12,470
Hahaha!

2173
01:18:13,990 --> 01:18:14,590
Yeah!

2174
01:18:24,080 --> 01:18:25,280
Jeff Bezos!

2175
01:18:25,620 --> 01:18:29,880
This brush you can use to hide is the power of dream life magic!

2176
01:18:30,580 --> 01:18:33,340
Well then, there's no time to lose.

2177
01:18:33,660 --> 01:18:36,400
Let's go inside and see what's become of this house.

2178
01:18:36,640 --> 01:18:37,380
Is this my house?

2179
01:18:37,860 --> 01:18:39,380
Are you my Tom Nook?

2180
01:18:41,440 --> 01:18:44,280
This is me when I get my paycheck.

2181
01:18:47,800 --> 01:18:48,400
Warehouse?

2182
01:18:48,440 --> 01:18:51,600
I have a new warehouse for Amazon.

2183
01:18:52,660 --> 01:18:55,920
Don't worry Dream Life Valley.

2184
01:18:56,120 --> 01:18:58,980
You will have your one day shipping here too.

2185
01:18:59,680 --> 01:19:00,520
Oh dear.

2186
01:19:00,740 --> 01:19:03,660
The night thorns have made their way inside the house too.

2187
01:19:04,280 --> 01:19:05,140
That's strange.

2188
01:19:05,480 --> 01:19:07,880
Suddenly, I can't remember why we came in here.

2189
01:19:09,340 --> 01:19:10,880
Must be the night thorns.

2190
01:19:13,100 --> 01:19:13,660
Precisely.

2191
01:19:13,660 --> 01:19:16,440
Being near so many of the clouds, the mine.

2192
01:19:18,500 --> 01:19:21,520
You must remove them before they consume more memories!

2193
01:19:21,860 --> 01:19:24,840
Focus your magic once again, Jeff Bezos!

2194
01:19:25,560 --> 01:19:27,460
You're a wizard, Bezos!

2195
01:19:32,360 --> 01:19:33,880
I'm just standing there.

2196
01:19:34,360 --> 01:19:36,540
The power of money!

2197
01:19:36,840 --> 01:19:37,500
Be gone!

2198
01:19:38,520 --> 01:19:39,520
Be gone!

2199
01:19:39,880 --> 01:19:41,560
I am a billionaire!

2200
01:19:42,560 --> 01:19:44,240
The money bee!

2201
01:19:49,160 --> 01:19:50,260
Alright, nice!

2202
01:19:51,240 --> 01:19:52,380
I got a photo!

2203
01:19:53,500 --> 01:19:57,440
Alright, let's turn down the music a little bit more!

2204
01:19:58,840 --> 01:19:59,840
Be gone!

2205
01:20:00,580 --> 01:20:01,420
Be gone!

2206
01:20:04,300 --> 01:20:06,820
Oh, I can have music playing too.

2207
01:20:07,420 --> 01:20:10,380
Guys, I can turn on and off the fire!

2208
01:20:10,920 --> 01:20:11,540
Truly!

2209
01:20:11,560 --> 01:20:12,140
Truly wonderful!

2210
01:20:12,380 --> 01:20:13,300
Oh, what's this?

2211
01:20:26,620 --> 01:20:27,100
Yeah!

2212
01:20:32,360 --> 01:20:33,480
I did it, Merlin!

2213
01:20:38,980 --> 01:20:41,280
The glowing orb you pulled from the Night Thorn!

2214
01:20:41,700 --> 01:20:42,620
It's a memory!

2215
01:20:44,220 --> 01:20:45,700
It's like a fog has lifted!

2216
01:20:46,040 --> 01:20:48,200
And I can recall something of great importance!

2217
01:20:48,880 --> 01:20:51,100
Mickey Mouse and I were at the Dream Castle!

2218
01:20:52,380 --> 01:20:53,380
Something important!

2219
01:20:55,260 --> 01:20:56,220
What was it?

2220
01:20:56,380 --> 01:20:57,880
I want to see the castle!

2221
01:20:58,400 --> 01:20:59,460
As you should!

2222
01:20:59,620 --> 01:21:01,180
The castle is magnificent!

2223
01:21:01,700 --> 01:21:03,740
Though I'm afraid it's seen better days!

2224
01:21:04,440 --> 01:21:07,740
If only I could remember what we left there!

2225
01:21:08,740 --> 01:21:11,120
Well, we must go solve this mystery!

2226
01:21:12,060 --> 01:21:12,660
Extraordinary!

2227
01:21:12,820 --> 01:21:13,200
But wait!

2228
01:21:13,360 --> 01:21:15,220
There's something else returning to me!

2229
01:21:15,920 --> 01:21:17,120
Oh my God!

2230
01:21:17,460 --> 01:21:18,480
You've got a friend in me!

2231
01:21:18,600 --> 01:21:19,220
Can you guys hear that?

2232
01:21:19,620 --> 01:21:21,880
You've got a friend in me!

2233
01:21:22,940 --> 01:21:23,740
Ba-da!

2234
01:21:23,820 --> 01:21:25,860
You've got a friend in me!

2235
01:21:26,040 --> 01:21:26,740
Ba-da-da!

2236
01:21:27,360 --> 01:21:28,360
Ba-da-da!

2237
01:21:28,460 --> 01:21:30,480
I wanna buy the castle!

2238
01:21:34,100 --> 01:21:36,280
We must find them quickly!

2239
01:21:36,740 --> 01:21:39,180
They're filled with ancient and powerful magic!

2240
01:21:39,520 --> 01:21:41,100
The royal tools and the magic!

2241
01:21:41,100 --> 01:21:43,300
If I could find those, then maybe I could...

2242
01:21:44,220 --> 01:21:46,000
learn more powerful...

2243
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:47,780
learn more powerful magic!

2244
01:21:48,260 --> 01:21:49,720
Perhaps, but remember...

2245
01:21:49,720 --> 01:21:53,360
magic is only as pure as the heart that wields it!

2246
01:21:54,040 --> 01:21:56,620
First we must obtain the pickaxe!

2247
01:21:56,700 --> 01:21:59,820
When the forgetting came, and our rulers left...

2248
01:21:59,820 --> 01:22:03,660
we found the pickaxe driven into a bladed stone in the plaza.

2249
01:22:04,020 --> 01:22:05,520
Come to think of it...

2250
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:08,480
that was around the time the sky went dark...

2251
01:22:08,480 --> 01:22:11,060
and the night thorns overran the plaza.

2252
01:22:12,260 --> 01:22:14,160
It's all a bit of a muddle, I'm afraid.

2253
01:22:14,580 --> 01:22:17,260
No one's been able to lift the pickaxe from the stone...

2254
01:22:17,260 --> 01:22:19,840
but then no one was you, Jeff Bezos!

2255
01:22:20,640 --> 01:22:22,020
And after all...

2256
01:22:22,020 --> 01:22:25,400
it wouldn't be the first time someone pulled something from a stone...

2257
01:22:25,400 --> 01:22:27,240
and became a hero of legend.

2258
01:22:27,540 --> 01:22:29,540
Ah yes, the legend of Jeff Bezos.

2259
01:22:29,940 --> 01:22:31,820
Pull the pickaxe from the stone!

2260
01:22:32,300 --> 01:22:34,840
You must also find three other royal tools.

2261
01:22:35,240 --> 01:22:36,340
The shovel...

2262
01:22:36,340 --> 01:22:37,780
the watering can...

2263
01:22:37,780 --> 01:22:39,280
and the fishing rod.

2264
01:22:39,500 --> 01:22:40,980
You'll need them for what's to come.

2265
01:22:41,160 --> 01:22:41,960
Oh my god!

2266
01:22:42,060 --> 01:22:43,080
I'm gonna fish!

2267
01:22:44,400 --> 01:22:45,300
Of course...

2268
01:22:47,200 --> 01:22:48,220
I'm gonna fish!

2269
01:22:49,240 --> 01:22:52,480
You'll need a safe place in the valley to eat, sleep, and keep your energy up.

2270
01:22:54,040 --> 01:22:56,300
It's got so... it's so small.

2271
01:22:57,560 --> 01:22:59,360
But was it always so?

2272
01:22:59,760 --> 01:23:00,840
In fact...

2273
01:23:01,720 --> 01:23:05,820
I seem to remember that the ruler of Dreamlike Valley had a house like this once.

2274
01:23:05,820 --> 01:23:09,320
Perhaps you'll do as much good for the valley as our ruler did.

2275
01:23:09,540 --> 01:23:12,440
In fact, here's a little something to get you started.

2276
01:23:12,920 --> 01:23:14,910
If you ever feel like you need a boost of energy...

2277
01:23:15,360 --> 01:23:17,980
there's something in there that will fill you right up.

2278
01:23:18,340 --> 01:23:19,600
I need to eat food?

2279
01:23:20,900 --> 01:23:22,060
What the fuck is that?

2280
01:23:23,160 --> 01:23:24,040
Now then...

2281
01:23:24,040 --> 01:23:25,500
I'll be at the Dream Castle.

2282
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:27,540
You'll find me there when you're ready.

2283
01:23:28,280 --> 01:23:29,880
Oh, so it's like the old mayor.

2284
01:23:30,860 --> 01:23:31,640
So like...

2285
01:23:31,640 --> 01:23:33,520
the old mayor ditched this place...

2286
01:23:33,520 --> 01:23:34,740
and then I replaced him.

2287
01:23:35,280 --> 01:23:37,580
Alright, so I have...

2288
01:23:38,540 --> 01:23:39,080
um...

2289
01:23:39,080 --> 01:23:41,280
That is my quest... and...

2290
01:23:41,280 --> 01:23:42,300
Wait...

2291
01:23:42,300 --> 01:23:44,000
What the fuck did I just do?

2292
01:23:44,520 --> 01:23:46,760
What... what did... what am I...

2293
01:23:47,820 --> 01:23:49,260
Hello, my name is Jeff Bezos.

2294
01:23:50,300 --> 01:23:51,820
Oh, I took a picture?

2295
01:23:51,980 --> 01:23:52,420
Alright.

2296
01:23:55,040 --> 01:23:55,880
Alright, open.

2297
01:23:56,440 --> 01:24:00,140
I wish my heart was as pure as yours was, Jeff.

2298
01:24:01,040 --> 01:24:03,500
Darkblade, thank you for the super chat.

2299
01:24:03,520 --> 01:24:04,780
Thank you, thank you.

2300
01:24:05,200 --> 01:24:05,880
What's this?

2301
01:24:08,660 --> 01:24:09,240
What's this?

2302
01:24:09,420 --> 01:24:10,640
Oh my god, get a backpack!

2303
01:24:13,800 --> 01:24:15,400
No, I'm not gonna quiff this.

2304
01:24:15,440 --> 01:24:17,120
Like, I'm off to a school trip.

2305
01:24:20,580 --> 01:24:21,260
What's this?

2306
01:24:21,460 --> 01:24:23,120
Oh my god, that black t-shirt!

2307
01:24:23,800 --> 01:24:26,140
No, the white shirt is the Bezos color.

2308
01:24:26,620 --> 01:24:27,920
Alright, let's put a chair.

2309
01:24:29,560 --> 01:24:30,000
Uh...

2310
01:24:30,380 --> 01:24:30,780
Oh, hey!

2311
01:24:31,820 --> 01:24:32,260
Let's...

2312
01:24:32,260 --> 01:24:34,720
Let's give myself a chair at least.

2313
01:24:34,860 --> 01:24:35,900
And then we'll get...

2314
01:24:35,900 --> 01:24:36,260
Uh...

2315
01:24:36,780 --> 01:24:37,520
Let's like...

2316
01:24:37,520 --> 01:24:40,340
Let's like minimalistic-lize this.

2317
01:24:40,800 --> 01:24:41,400
Alright.

2318
01:24:41,800 --> 01:24:42,780
There we go.

2319
01:24:42,940 --> 01:24:45,080
I gotta make sure it fits the Jeff vibe.

2320
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:46,400
Alright, simple...

2321
01:24:46,800 --> 01:24:48,180
Where's the wooden floor?

2322
01:24:48,260 --> 01:24:49,020
There we go.

2323
01:24:49,780 --> 01:24:51,120
There we go.

2324
01:24:51,520 --> 01:24:53,260
That's what Jeff likes.

2325
01:24:54,520 --> 01:24:55,120
Nice.

2326
01:24:55,260 --> 01:24:56,080
Alright, nice.

2327
01:24:56,340 --> 01:24:57,480
Everything's looking good.

2328
01:24:57,740 --> 01:24:59,180
Put on the backpack.

2329
01:24:59,320 --> 01:25:00,900
It's time for school.

2330
01:25:01,320 --> 01:25:01,920
Hahaha.

2331
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:04,480
Nice.

2332
01:25:04,480 --> 01:25:05,040
What's this?

2333
01:25:05,900 --> 01:25:06,820
I got mail?

2334
01:25:07,220 --> 01:25:08,200
I don't got no mail.

2335
01:25:08,400 --> 01:25:08,620
Oh!

2336
01:25:09,200 --> 01:25:09,900
What's this?

2337
01:25:11,220 --> 01:25:11,700
Claim.

2338
01:25:13,680 --> 01:25:14,160
Alright.

2339
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:16,480
Expires a rift in time.

2340
01:25:16,580 --> 01:25:17,060
Oh shit!

2341
01:25:17,220 --> 01:25:17,620
Claim.

2342
01:25:18,440 --> 01:25:19,300
Claim anyway?

2343
01:25:19,500 --> 01:25:19,660
No.

2344
01:25:19,720 --> 01:25:20,440
Okay, gold edition.

2345
01:25:20,760 --> 01:25:21,160
Oh!

2346
01:25:21,700 --> 01:25:23,240
Oh my god, I got a capybara!

2347
01:25:23,440 --> 01:25:24,120
This is a...

2348
01:25:24,120 --> 01:25:24,800
This is a gold!

2349
01:25:26,380 --> 01:25:26,860
Nice.

2350
01:25:28,560 --> 01:25:29,560
Hey Jeff Bezos!

2351
01:25:29,680 --> 01:25:32,240
I love giving treats to my pals and you're a one-year-old.

2352
01:25:32,260 --> 01:25:35,400
I'm Jeff as friends with Mickey?!

2353
01:25:39,380 --> 01:25:40,000
Alright.

2354
01:25:42,460 --> 01:25:43,080
Nice.

2355
01:25:43,420 --> 01:25:44,920
That's what we like to see.

2356
01:25:47,780 --> 01:25:50,260
Oh my god!

2357
01:25:51,080 --> 01:25:53,160
Guys, I'm friends with Mickey!

2358
01:25:54,200 --> 01:25:56,140
Jeff as friends with Mickey!

2359
01:25:57,720 --> 01:25:58,640
Alright, nice.

2360
01:25:59,120 --> 01:26:00,300
You know what?

2361
01:26:00,840 --> 01:26:02,240
Guys, this is very odd.

2362
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:02,580
This is really important.

2363
01:26:02,700 --> 01:26:05,560
I gotta put my capybara... wait, where's my...

2364
01:26:06,060 --> 01:26:08,300
Where the fuck is the capybara?

2365
01:26:09,020 --> 01:26:11,840
What the fuck?

2366
01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:12,080
Okay.

2367
01:26:12,780 --> 01:26:16,760
What the fuck is this dreamlight arm?

2368
01:26:16,920 --> 01:26:18,000
Oh, there he is!

2369
01:26:23,240 --> 01:26:25,340
Wait, he's just... he's just there!

2370
01:26:28,080 --> 01:26:29,220
You're just there!

2371
01:26:29,420 --> 01:26:30,320
Do you follow me?

2372
01:26:31,220 --> 01:26:32,660
What are you?

2373
01:26:33,980 --> 01:26:35,100
No, he's just there.

2374
01:26:35,220 --> 01:26:35,480
Okay.

2375
01:26:35,640 --> 01:26:36,540
He's just there.

2376
01:26:37,200 --> 01:26:39,860
Alright, this should be worthy... check.

2377
01:26:40,900 --> 01:26:42,360
What the fuck is this?

2378
01:26:43,520 --> 01:26:45,280
Oh, is this where you sell stuff?

2379
01:26:45,540 --> 01:26:47,120
Oh, this is where you sell stuff.

2380
01:26:47,440 --> 01:26:49,000
Oh, he does follow me!

2381
01:26:50,520 --> 01:26:52,280
Fine, Merlin, wait... oh, there he is.

2382
01:26:54,260 --> 01:26:55,640
Alright, little Jeff.

2383
01:26:57,520 --> 01:26:59,540
Jeff's heart is the purest of them all.

2384
01:26:59,580 --> 01:27:01,260
Pure greed, that is.

2385
01:27:01,400 --> 01:27:02,240
How dare you?

2386
01:27:02,280 --> 01:27:02,640
Merlin's the purest of them all.

2387
01:27:02,660 --> 01:27:03,620
You said that I'm special.

2388
01:27:04,680 --> 01:27:06,360
Thank you for the super chat, Delta.

2389
01:27:06,420 --> 01:27:07,300
Thank you, thank you.

2390
01:27:09,400 --> 01:27:12,160
Jeff Bezos, this is the dream castle.

2391
01:27:12,500 --> 01:27:14,580
It holds many secrets.

2392
01:27:15,060 --> 01:27:16,460
Er, answers.

2393
01:27:16,980 --> 01:27:18,980
Er, uh, oh, blast it all.

2394
01:27:19,180 --> 01:27:21,000
I can't seem to remember what's inside.

2395
01:27:21,760 --> 01:27:24,920
I bet that inside the castle, we'll find...

2396
01:27:24,920 --> 01:27:25,700
Riches!

2397
01:27:25,720 --> 01:27:27,180
Riches beyond measures!

2398
01:27:28,400 --> 01:27:30,940
You'd rather sound like a Mr. McDuck, I know.

2399
01:27:30,940 --> 01:27:33,660
Well, you can call me Mr. McGlizzard.

2400
01:27:35,600 --> 01:27:39,420
Well, I'm no doubt the castle contains many wonders.

2401
01:27:40,380 --> 01:27:45,340
Let's hope they include the secret to restoring Dreamlight Valley to its former glory.

2402
01:27:46,780 --> 01:27:47,540
Let's see.

2403
01:27:48,220 --> 01:27:49,940
Those n- Let's go inside!

2404
01:27:50,840 --> 01:27:53,040
Easier said than done, Jeff Bezos.

2405
01:27:53,540 --> 01:27:57,980
The night thorns that encase the dream castle aren't like any you've dealt with before.

2406
01:27:58,260 --> 01:27:59,180
Rather peculiar.

2407
01:27:59,180 --> 01:28:00,460
They're stronger!

2408
01:28:00,900 --> 01:28:03,460
And will take more of your magic to defeat.

2409
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:04,620
Follow me.

2410
01:28:04,720 --> 01:28:06,240
There's so much more to show you.

2411
01:28:06,460 --> 01:28:07,380
Alright, don't worry.

2412
01:28:07,680 --> 01:28:08,720
Oh, I have to follow you?

2413
01:28:08,820 --> 01:28:09,300
Oh my god.

2414
01:28:10,340 --> 01:28:11,060
Don't worry!

2415
01:28:12,060 --> 01:28:12,700
My legs!

2416
01:28:12,860 --> 01:28:13,540
I work out!

2417
01:28:16,140 --> 01:28:19,620
Everything in Dreamlight Valley is well made of Dreamlight!

2418
01:28:20,460 --> 01:28:22,940
The sparkles you see over everything and everyone.

2419
01:28:23,400 --> 01:28:25,440
Even wizards such as myself.

2420
01:28:26,280 --> 01:28:27,320
But Dreamlight...

2421
01:28:27,320 --> 01:28:33,220
Became scarcer and scarcer as the forgetting fell over the valley.

2422
01:28:33,460 --> 01:28:34,080
Wonderful!

2423
01:28:35,100 --> 01:28:38,920
Ever since you arrived though, the magic has started to come back.

2424
01:28:39,120 --> 01:28:40,700
I told you the power of money works.

2425
01:28:41,100 --> 01:28:43,420
The Scrooge got competition.

2426
01:28:43,980 --> 01:28:46,720
I want to make it stronger!

2427
01:28:49,360 --> 01:28:50,000
Alright.

2428
01:28:50,140 --> 01:28:53,740
But it's not through the desire of power that the magic grows.

2429
01:28:54,280 --> 01:28:54,840
Mm-hmm.

2430
01:28:54,840 --> 01:29:00,380
Dreamlight magic grows stronger through acts of friendship, love, and care.

2431
01:29:00,540 --> 01:29:01,360
The fuck is that?

2432
01:29:03,760 --> 01:29:04,440
Care?

2433
01:29:06,760 --> 01:29:12,540
Simple acts like removing night thorns or forging a friendship with me.

2434
01:29:13,220 --> 01:29:19,120
Gaze into the well and discover the different tasks that will create more Dreamlight.

2435
01:29:20,200 --> 01:29:22,640
And payments of $9.99.

2436
01:29:23,160 --> 01:29:24,700
Is there Twitch Prime here?

2437
01:29:25,500 --> 01:29:33,480
But to fully embrace the potential of Dreamlight, you'll need to gather the royal tools that were lost during the forgetting.

2438
01:29:33,900 --> 01:29:38,560
Remember, for some wizard, magic requires magical implants.

2439
01:29:39,620 --> 01:29:43,080
You'll need those tools to save Dreamlight Valley.

2440
01:29:44,180 --> 01:29:46,800
Mickey's been the guardian of the village since the forgetting.

2441
01:29:47,060 --> 01:29:50,820
Perhaps he knows the whereabouts of the watering can and the shovel.

2442
01:29:51,860 --> 01:29:52,660
Let's see.

2443
01:29:52,780 --> 01:29:53,320
Fishing!

2444
01:29:53,500 --> 01:29:53,860
Fishing!

2445
01:29:53,860 --> 01:29:55,060
Ah, yes!

2446
01:29:55,340 --> 01:29:57,480
Goofy is very fond of fishing.

2447
01:29:57,820 --> 01:30:00,680
Be sure to know where you can find the lost fishing rod.

2448
01:30:00,860 --> 01:30:01,880
Where's Donald?

2449
01:30:01,960 --> 01:30:04,300
I don't care about Goofy or Mickey!

2450
01:30:04,880 --> 01:30:06,000
Where's Donald?

2451
01:30:06,480 --> 01:30:06,980
I want...

2452
01:30:06,980 --> 01:30:08,380
Look, there's my capybara.

2453
01:30:09,960 --> 01:30:11,440
There she goes.

2454
01:30:11,780 --> 01:30:12,900
There she goes.

2455
01:30:14,620 --> 01:30:19,140
Till I've ever heard from him since the stones blocked our path to the meadow to the south.

2456
01:30:20,160 --> 01:30:22,640
Well, you must find him so I'd start there.

2457
01:30:23,280 --> 01:30:25,000
Why do I keep taking pictures?

2458
01:30:25,680 --> 01:30:26,180
What?

2459
01:30:26,520 --> 01:30:28,680
Use Dreamlight to restore the valley.

2460
01:30:29,060 --> 01:30:32,640
Remove knife thorns from the castle entrance and other parts of the valley.

2461
01:30:32,780 --> 01:30:33,020
Okay.

2462
01:30:33,520 --> 01:30:34,660
Gaze into this.

2463
01:30:35,020 --> 01:30:37,360
Alright, how many Dreamlights do I have?

2464
01:30:39,900 --> 01:30:41,120
I don't have a lot.

2465
01:30:42,720 --> 01:30:44,040
So I have to...

2466
01:30:44,780 --> 01:30:46,920
I have to go see Mickey.

2467
01:30:47,100 --> 01:30:48,020
Mickey's over there.

2468
01:30:48,300 --> 01:30:50,640
Is there a way to pull up my map faster?

2469
01:30:51,340 --> 01:30:52,260
Alright, I...

2470
01:30:52,640 --> 01:30:53,440
I assume...

2471
01:30:53,440 --> 01:30:54,440
Can I remove this?

2472
01:30:55,060 --> 01:30:55,680
Be gone!

2473
01:30:56,300 --> 01:30:57,020
Be gone!

2474
01:30:59,260 --> 01:31:00,100
Be gone!

2475
01:31:00,980 --> 01:31:01,920
Oh, hey, money.

2476
01:31:02,140 --> 01:31:02,720
Nice.

2477
01:31:03,780 --> 01:31:04,360
Nice.

2478
01:31:04,580 --> 01:31:05,680
As Chef Bezo says.

2479
01:31:06,440 --> 01:31:07,020
Money.

2480
01:31:07,860 --> 01:31:08,440
Alright.

2481
01:31:09,280 --> 01:31:10,120
See ya.

2482
01:31:10,460 --> 01:31:12,780
I'll get rid of as many...

2483
01:31:12,780 --> 01:31:14,520
Oh my god, I got carrots too?

2484
01:31:16,540 --> 01:31:17,480
Stop, stop.

2485
01:31:17,620 --> 01:31:18,820
I keep petting the capybara.

2486
01:31:19,520 --> 01:31:20,560
I keep...

2487
01:31:20,560 --> 01:31:22,620
I keep petting the capybara.

2488
01:31:22,620 --> 01:31:25,180
Instead of fucking removing the thorns.

2489
01:31:25,600 --> 01:31:28,720
Oh, I guess this is like where you garden and stuff, right?

2490
01:31:28,840 --> 01:31:30,080
No, that's just thorns.

2491
01:31:30,080 --> 01:31:31,280
That's just more thorns.

2492
01:31:31,900 --> 01:31:33,460
Oh, I can collect Dreamlight!

2493
01:31:33,740 --> 01:31:34,180
Alright.

2494
01:31:34,380 --> 01:31:35,840
I finished my job.

2495
01:31:36,900 --> 01:31:39,500
I finished my job of removing thorns.

2496
01:31:39,800 --> 01:31:40,900
So now I...

2497
01:31:40,900 --> 01:31:42,620
Now I can collect my Dreamlight.

2498
01:31:43,380 --> 01:31:44,280
Alright, nice.

2499
01:31:44,560 --> 01:31:46,540
I have to remove 230...

2500
01:31:46,540 --> 01:31:50,020
Okay, from like 20 to 230?

2501
01:31:50,020 --> 01:31:52,740
Like, what kind of jump was that?

2502
01:31:53,100 --> 01:31:54,840
Like, what the fuck?

2503
01:31:58,500 --> 01:32:00,180
Oh, hey there's...

2504
01:32:00,180 --> 01:32:01,320
Oh, whoops.

2505
01:32:04,260 --> 01:32:04,880
Okay.

2506
01:32:10,360 --> 01:32:11,160
What's this?

2507
01:32:13,300 --> 01:32:13,920
Rawr.

2508
01:32:20,470 --> 01:32:22,370
Alright, let's see.

2509
01:32:22,430 --> 01:32:22,810
What do we have here?

2510
01:32:22,810 --> 01:32:23,170
What can...

2511
01:32:23,170 --> 01:32:24,010
Oh, hey.

2512
01:32:29,590 --> 01:32:29,910
Okay.

2513
01:32:30,570 --> 01:32:31,410
Let's see.

2514
01:32:31,610 --> 01:32:32,850
Let's see what is there.

2515
01:32:32,970 --> 01:32:34,670
Oh, that's quite dreamy.

2516
01:32:34,670 --> 01:32:35,550
Not gonna lie.

2517
01:32:35,930 --> 01:32:37,830
That is quite dreamy.

2518
01:32:37,930 --> 01:32:38,470
Let's...

2519
01:32:41,470 --> 01:32:42,110
Nice.

2520
01:32:43,750 --> 01:32:44,390
Alright.

2521
01:32:44,950 --> 01:32:45,910
Save only.

2522
01:32:46,730 --> 01:32:47,370
Yes.

2523
01:32:49,390 --> 01:32:51,390
Actually, gotta screenshot this.

2524
01:32:51,850 --> 01:32:52,830
I'll do one too.

2525
01:32:58,130 --> 01:32:58,930
There you go.

2526
01:33:02,710 --> 01:33:03,150
Alright.

2527
01:33:03,370 --> 01:33:04,650
Alright, I took my photo.

2528
01:33:05,170 --> 01:33:05,610
Nice.

2529
01:33:08,030 --> 01:33:08,470
Oh.

2530
01:33:08,990 --> 01:33:09,770
There's a squirrel?

2531
01:33:10,370 --> 01:33:11,450
What the fuck you want?

2532
01:33:14,550 --> 01:33:16,170
The fuck would I give you anything?

2533
01:33:17,870 --> 01:33:19,290
I mean, you want carrot seed?

2534
01:33:19,770 --> 01:33:21,030
You don't want carrot seed?

2535
01:33:21,730 --> 01:33:23,750
Why the fuck I gave you carrot seed?

2536
01:33:26,250 --> 01:33:27,630
You said no.

2537
01:33:28,830 --> 01:33:29,810
That's messed up.

2538
01:33:29,870 --> 01:33:31,870
I actually got more carrot seeds anyway.

2539
01:33:33,010 --> 01:33:33,630
That's right.

2540
01:33:33,710 --> 01:33:35,350
This is why I have my capybara.

2541
01:33:35,930 --> 01:33:38,330
At least my capybara appreciates me.

2542
01:33:39,610 --> 01:33:40,090
Alright.

2543
01:33:40,290 --> 01:33:41,350
Good day to you.

2544
01:33:41,930 --> 01:33:43,350
You gave me quite a start.

2545
01:33:44,230 --> 01:33:47,950
Don't you know never to sneak up to someone while he's contemplating his investments?

2546
01:33:48,690 --> 01:33:50,170
Oh, I'm Jeff Bezos.

2547
01:33:50,170 --> 01:33:53,330
And you're Scrooge McDuck.

2548
01:33:53,390 --> 01:33:54,270
You're my hero.

2549
01:33:55,750 --> 01:33:57,350
Aye, that I am.

2550
01:33:57,610 --> 01:33:59,890
You must keep up with the business news.

2551
01:34:00,450 --> 01:34:04,410
Though my business isn't in a story state these days.

2552
01:34:04,630 --> 01:34:06,170
Just look at my shop.

2553
01:34:07,710 --> 01:34:10,150
The whole village is not so bad.

2554
01:34:11,230 --> 01:34:13,190
Ah, an optimist.

2555
01:34:13,270 --> 01:34:14,250
Good for you.

2556
01:34:14,510 --> 01:34:15,490
We shall see.

2557
01:34:15,630 --> 01:34:17,050
Some see hopelessness.

2558
01:34:17,250 --> 01:34:19,090
Others see opportunity.

2559
01:34:20,150 --> 01:34:24,650
After the sky went dark, most of the villagers skedaddled.

2560
01:34:24,770 --> 01:34:25,690
Where do they go?

2561
01:34:26,010 --> 01:34:27,410
To the fucking wild?

2562
01:34:27,730 --> 01:34:29,210
Like, why would they leave?

2563
01:34:29,750 --> 01:34:33,290
And fewer and fewer clients came in until they stopped altogether.

2564
01:34:33,750 --> 01:34:35,830
But I cannot remember where they all went.

2565
01:34:36,810 --> 01:34:38,890
I know I stayed to take care of my shop.

2566
01:34:39,090 --> 01:34:40,510
And my money, of course.

2567
01:34:40,530 --> 01:34:42,830
I'm gonna buy you up, Mr. McDuck.

2568
01:34:44,510 --> 01:34:45,110
Then...

2569
01:34:45,110 --> 01:34:45,910
Hmm...

2570
01:34:45,910 --> 01:34:46,810
Oh, yes.

2571
01:34:47,050 --> 01:34:48,970
The night thorns blocked me in.

2572
01:34:49,090 --> 01:34:51,070
And I cannot remember much after that.

2573
01:34:51,370 --> 01:34:52,210
But like...

2574
01:34:52,210 --> 01:34:56,010
Like glittering off gold, I'm starting to remember how the village used to be.

2575
01:34:56,170 --> 01:34:58,370
And all its investment opportunities.

2576
01:35:00,790 --> 01:35:02,310
I'd like to get in on this.

2577
01:35:02,510 --> 01:35:04,240
So, one of the replies is...

2578
01:35:04,670 --> 01:35:06,230
Life's more about more...

2579
01:35:06,230 --> 01:35:07,970
Life's about more than money.

2580
01:35:08,510 --> 01:35:09,050
Clearly.

2581
01:35:09,810 --> 01:35:12,490
They don't know who's playing this game right now.

2582
01:35:12,790 --> 01:35:13,750
Jeff Bezos.

2583
01:35:14,750 --> 01:35:15,290
Hmm...

2584
01:35:15,290 --> 01:35:16,590
I could use some help.

2585
01:35:16,750 --> 01:35:17,930
That much is true.

2586
01:35:17,930 --> 01:35:20,130
Perhaps we come to an arrangement.

2587
01:35:21,350 --> 01:35:22,230
Let's hear it.

2588
01:35:23,130 --> 01:35:25,670
I've got a deal for you, Jeff Bezos.

2589
01:35:26,170 --> 01:35:31,250
If you help me make enough star coins to put my shop back in business...

2590
01:35:32,030 --> 01:35:36,190
I'll make sure it's stocked with everything needed to put the valley back together.

2591
01:35:36,490 --> 01:35:37,390
Oh my god!

2592
01:35:37,430 --> 01:35:39,010
I'm opening my first...

2593
01:35:39,010 --> 01:35:42,810
I'm working with Scrooge McDuck to open my first Amazon warehouse!

2594
01:35:45,090 --> 01:35:46,430
Oh my god!

2595
01:35:46,510 --> 01:35:47,910
We're bringing back Prozac!

2596
01:35:47,910 --> 01:35:48,450
Prime!

2597
01:35:49,950 --> 01:35:52,910
Goofy used to have a stall in the meadow to the south.

2598
01:35:53,270 --> 01:35:54,670
I'm sure he apparently...

2599
01:35:54,670 --> 01:35:56,990
He appreciates any help you can give him.

2600
01:35:57,170 --> 01:35:59,470
That lad doesn't have a mind for money.

2601
01:35:59,950 --> 01:36:02,590
You'll need to find a way to bring...

2602
01:36:02,590 --> 01:36:05,930
To break the rocks blocking the road to the meadow when you do.

2603
01:36:07,230 --> 01:36:10,030
Find Goofy and help him get back in business.

2604
01:36:10,190 --> 01:36:11,970
Then you can help me with my grand reopening.

2605
01:36:12,430 --> 01:36:14,010
Oh, and I see you have a map there.

2606
01:36:14,150 --> 01:36:17,210
Don't forget to use it when you find your way around the village.

2607
01:36:17,990 --> 01:36:18,850
Alright, nice.

2608
01:36:19,490 --> 01:36:20,370
I have...

2609
01:36:20,830 --> 01:36:22,690
I have now acquired...

2610
01:36:22,690 --> 01:36:25,430
The button to open my map.

2611
01:36:25,790 --> 01:36:27,250
I've acquired the M.

2612
01:36:28,050 --> 01:36:28,870
Alright, nice!

2613
01:36:29,970 --> 01:36:33,410
Me and Mr. McDuck are gonna work together to...

2614
01:36:34,290 --> 01:36:35,250
Is it this way?

2615
01:36:35,670 --> 01:36:39,430
Me and Mr. McDuck are gonna work together to open the Amazon warehouse.

2616
01:36:40,030 --> 01:36:41,010
It's gonna be great!

2617
01:36:41,830 --> 01:36:42,390
Mickey!

2618
01:36:42,850 --> 01:36:43,410
Mickey!

2619
01:36:45,690 --> 01:36:46,270
I'm gonna get you out of here.

2620
01:36:46,270 --> 01:36:49,090
But what if I want you to forget so I can take over your empire?

2621
01:36:49,770 --> 01:36:53,380
Jeff Be- What?

2622
01:36:55,320 --> 01:36:57,320
Oh, that's Goofy.

2623
01:36:58,660 --> 01:36:59,700
Jeff Bezos!

2624
01:37:02,060 --> 01:37:03,080
Oh boy!

2625
01:37:03,300 --> 01:37:04,600
Am I glad to see you!

2626
01:37:06,940 --> 01:37:07,920
Mickey Mouse!

2627
01:37:09,420 --> 01:37:11,020
I'm a big fan!

2628
01:37:12,820 --> 01:37:14,760
Well, I'm a big fan of Mickey Mouse!

2629
01:37:14,780 --> 01:37:14,880
I'm a big fan of yours!

2630
01:37:15,240 --> 01:37:16,060
In fact...

2631
01:37:16,060 --> 01:37:22,280
I saw you talking to Merlin and came in to get something for ya.

2632
01:37:23,540 --> 01:37:24,180
Oh boy!

2633
01:37:24,600 --> 01:37:26,700
But I can't seem to remember what.

2634
01:37:27,760 --> 01:37:30,280
It must be because of these nightborns.

2635
01:37:30,940 --> 01:37:33,000
I'll help you remember, Mickey.

2636
01:37:37,800 --> 01:37:39,280
Don't worry, Mickey.

2637
01:37:40,020 --> 01:37:43,600
Mr. Bezos will help you remember the important thing.

2638
01:37:46,880 --> 01:37:47,460
I'll help you remember the important thing.

2639
01:37:47,520 --> 01:37:49,240
Sorry, I went goofy again.

2640
01:37:49,360 --> 01:37:49,740
Gosh!

2641
01:37:49,940 --> 01:37:51,760
These nightborns are the worst!

2642
01:37:52,020 --> 01:37:54,360
I tried everything and nothing works!

2643
01:37:54,660 --> 01:37:55,260
Oh, gosh!

2644
01:37:55,340 --> 01:37:55,880
Oh, gosh!

2645
01:37:58,100 --> 01:38:01,920
Alright, time to make sure Mickey remembers!

2646
01:38:02,320 --> 01:38:03,440
Oh, wait, what's this?

2647
01:38:04,080 --> 01:38:05,160
Oh, not that.

2648
01:38:05,540 --> 01:38:07,020
Wait, why am I resting?

2649
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:09,120
Alright, check.

2650
01:38:10,140 --> 01:38:11,500
Ba-da-dum!

2651
01:38:12,100 --> 01:38:13,560
Ba-da-dum!

2652
01:38:13,680 --> 01:38:14,240
Ba-dum!

2653
01:38:14,240 --> 01:38:14,780
Ba-dum!

2654
01:38:14,780 --> 01:38:15,320
Ba-dum!

2655
01:38:15,320 --> 01:38:15,860
Ba-dum!

2656
01:38:15,860 --> 01:38:16,400
Ba-dum!

2657
01:38:16,400 --> 01:38:17,980
What the fuck is this?

2658
01:38:18,420 --> 01:38:21,260
Puts on a good fro- Oh, is this the Mickey language?

2659
01:38:22,040 --> 01:38:24,460
But I can tell he's utterly heartbroken.

2660
01:38:24,700 --> 01:38:26,100
Minnie was his other ham.

2661
01:38:26,160 --> 01:38:27,340
Now that she's- No!

2662
01:38:28,100 --> 01:38:28,660
Mickey!

2663
01:38:33,170 --> 01:38:33,730
Minnie!

2664
01:38:34,910 --> 01:38:36,030
That's Atlantean?

2665
01:38:36,110 --> 01:38:36,950
Wait, is that really?

2666
01:38:37,430 --> 01:38:38,970
I can't believe it!

2667
01:38:39,370 --> 01:38:40,910
Minnie left Mickey!

2668
01:38:41,910 --> 01:38:43,910
I don't know how long it will be.

2669
01:38:44,030 --> 01:38:45,330
She took him!

2670
01:38:45,910 --> 01:38:46,810
It's okay, Mickey.

2671
01:38:46,810 --> 01:38:50,570
I, Jeff Bezos, know what it's like to get the Force.

2672
01:38:50,810 --> 01:38:52,550
That bitch took half of everything.

2673
01:38:53,750 --> 01:38:56,710
I'm gonna steal your stuff in the- Do you have anything in your chest?

2674
01:38:57,270 --> 01:38:59,090
Don't worry, that was my stuff, Mickey.

2675
01:38:59,290 --> 01:39:01,750
I know you forgot, but I kept it there for storage.

2676
01:39:03,530 --> 01:39:04,510
Ba-ba-dum!

2677
01:39:04,550 --> 01:39:05,490
Ba-ba-dum!

2678
01:39:05,510 --> 01:39:06,590
Ba-ba-dum!

2679
01:39:06,590 --> 01:39:07,070
Ba-dum!

2680
01:39:07,110 --> 01:39:08,190
Ba-da-dum!

2681
01:39:08,190 --> 01:39:09,210
Ba-da-dum!

2682
01:39:09,450 --> 01:39:11,050
Oh, my inventory is full?

2683
01:39:11,210 --> 01:39:12,210
What's in my inventory?

2684
01:39:12,650 --> 01:39:16,410
Do you want to buy these twi- I need a- Okay!

2685
01:39:16,410 --> 01:39:18,030
What the fuck?

2686
01:39:18,410 --> 01:39:20,530
Alright, let's open this.

2687
01:39:21,070 --> 01:39:23,990
How the fuck was I supposed to know I have limited storage?

2688
01:39:24,330 --> 01:39:24,910
Oh, my God!

2689
01:39:25,050 --> 01:39:26,570
I have the Mickey backpack!

2690
01:39:27,290 --> 01:39:31,550
The black- The black mi- That's why it was in storage.

2691
01:39:31,930 --> 01:39:34,770
He's trying to do everything he can to forget about her.

2692
01:39:35,630 --> 01:39:36,130
Alright.

2693
01:39:36,310 --> 01:39:36,810
Nice.

2694
01:39:36,850 --> 01:39:37,550
We got a book.

2695
01:39:39,050 --> 01:39:40,710
Ba-ba-dum!

2696
01:39:40,810 --> 01:39:41,730
Ba-ba-dum!

2697
01:39:41,870 --> 01:39:43,390
That's fucked up.

2698
01:39:43,510 --> 01:39:45,410
But why did she keep the Minnie backpack?

2699
01:39:46,450 --> 01:39:48,270
Mickey, that's messed up!

2700
01:39:48,470 --> 01:39:49,710
You have to move on!

2701
01:39:49,790 --> 01:39:50,530
She's gone!

2702
01:39:53,050 --> 01:39:54,570
Oh, there's Remi!

2703
01:39:56,650 --> 01:39:57,770
And there's Eve?

2704
01:39:57,850 --> 01:39:59,450
What the fuck is Eve doing here?

2705
01:40:00,910 --> 01:40:02,510
She's so out of place!

2706
01:40:03,010 --> 01:40:04,210
Oh, there's the golden shovel!

2707
01:40:04,790 --> 01:40:05,770
Wait, the golden shovel's here!

2708
01:40:06,190 --> 01:40:07,710
She's so out of place!

2709
01:40:07,710 --> 01:40:08,970
What's she doing here?

2710
01:40:09,210 --> 01:40:11,110
He's dating another rat!

2711
01:40:11,650 --> 01:40:15,390
Oh, no, he's just so out of place.

2712
01:40:15,390 --> 01:40:16,950
He's supporting local rap businesses!

2713
01:40:17,710 --> 01:40:19,050
This is his restaurant!

2714
01:40:19,370 --> 01:40:21,630
He's supporting local rap businesses, guys!

2715
01:40:22,310 --> 01:40:25,030
Wait, I wanna... okay, I need to open this.

2716
01:40:29,950 --> 01:40:31,910
What do I not need?

2717
01:40:32,190 --> 01:40:32,530
Glass?

2718
01:40:32,970 --> 01:40:33,530
Okay.

2719
01:40:36,630 --> 01:40:38,790
I'm trying to figure out what I don't need.

2720
01:40:39,150 --> 01:40:41,650
Alright, we don't need dandelions, guys.

2721
01:40:41,770 --> 01:40:43,370
We don't need medicine here.

2722
01:40:45,650 --> 01:40:50,490
Guys, we don't need medicine in... in Dreamlight Valley.

2723
01:40:52,570 --> 01:40:53,450
Alright, nice.

2724
01:40:53,610 --> 01:40:53,790
Alright.

2725
01:40:54,570 --> 01:40:56,190
Maybe that's why Minnie left him.

2726
01:40:57,770 --> 01:41:00,530
He's like, I forgot what... why she left me.

2727
01:41:00,690 --> 01:41:01,510
I forgot...

2728
01:41:02,690 --> 01:41:04,150
Okay, that does not fit.

2729
01:41:04,450 --> 01:41:05,610
How do I open the book?

2730
01:41:05,690 --> 01:41:06,970
Somebody's like, open the book!

2731
01:41:07,330 --> 01:41:08,910
Alright, now I'll pick this back up.

2732
01:41:10,230 --> 01:41:11,910
I'll pick up the flowers back.

2733
01:41:12,270 --> 01:41:13,190
Alright, let's see.

2734
01:41:13,450 --> 01:41:15,110
So at least I can open the book.

2735
01:41:15,810 --> 01:41:17,550
Is this characters?

2736
01:41:17,950 --> 01:41:20,370
Oh, is it the characters?

2737
01:41:21,850 --> 01:41:24,030
Oh, I can have them change clothes!

2738
01:41:26,950 --> 01:41:30,030
We don't need that here.

2739
01:41:30,370 --> 01:41:31,790
I don't know what you're talking about.

2740
01:41:31,850 --> 01:41:33,530
We do not need that here.

2741
01:41:36,710 --> 01:41:37,010
What?

2742
01:41:37,110 --> 01:41:38,110
What was the book?

2743
01:41:38,190 --> 01:41:40,010
I don't know what the book was!

2744
01:41:40,230 --> 01:41:41,550
There's a shop?

2745
01:41:41,990 --> 01:41:44,930
Oh my god, what the fuck?

2746
01:41:45,390 --> 01:41:52,690
Why is this... why is there... I already paid $50... $80 and you want more of my money?

2747
01:41:53,830 --> 01:41:55,890
Like... like... what?

2748
01:41:57,210 --> 01:41:59,070
Why would I need skins?

2749
01:41:59,830 --> 01:42:01,450
Why would I need...

2750
01:42:05,450 --> 01:42:10,890
Oh my god... I seriously... Oh my god, I fucking get Carl's house though!

2751
01:42:12,450 --> 01:42:14,990
Astrum, thank you for the magenta soupa!

2752
01:42:14,990 --> 01:42:15,950
Thank you, thank you!

2753
01:42:16,070 --> 01:42:17,870
Hi Toki, it's my birthday today.

2754
01:42:17,950 --> 01:42:19,170
Can I get a birthday greeting?

2755
01:42:19,490 --> 01:42:21,290
Also hope you enjoy God Award later.

2756
01:42:21,390 --> 01:42:22,790
It's one of my favorite games, of course!

2757
01:42:23,070 --> 01:42:29,370
Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday dear Astrum, happy birthday to you!

2758
01:42:29,510 --> 01:42:29,910
Yeah!

2759
01:42:30,430 --> 01:42:32,650
Thank you again for the magenta soupa!

2760
01:42:33,350 --> 01:42:38,010
I... I can't believe... Oh my god, I can't... These look like...

2761
01:42:38,010 --> 01:42:39,790
They look like ghosts!

2762
01:42:39,790 --> 01:42:42,570
They literally look like dead pets!

2763
01:42:43,170 --> 01:42:44,890
I'm like, what the fuck?

2764
01:42:45,190 --> 01:42:47,830
They look like dead fucking pets!

2765
01:42:48,370 --> 01:42:49,630
Holy shit!

2766
01:42:50,070 --> 01:42:50,610
Like...

2767
01:42:50,610 --> 01:42:52,310
What was the book?

2768
01:42:52,470 --> 01:42:54,550
Is the book like... the friendship?

2769
01:42:55,150 --> 01:42:57,190
How can... how many friends can I make?

2770
01:42:57,570 --> 01:42:59,570
Oh, Ricket Ralph...

2771
01:42:59,570 --> 01:43:01,250
Oh, Merlin...

2772
01:43:01,690 --> 01:43:02,690
What's the book?

2773
01:43:03,410 --> 01:43:04,690
What's the book?

2774
01:43:05,550 --> 01:43:06,690
I don't understand!

2775
01:43:06,890 --> 01:43:07,970
Is the book...

2776
01:43:07,970 --> 01:43:09,310
Oh, is it my inventory?

2777
01:43:09,790 --> 01:43:10,830
I did not see it.

2778
01:43:11,570 --> 01:43:12,690
Oh, there it is!

2779
01:43:12,850 --> 01:43:14,090
Guys, I just found the book.

2780
01:43:14,950 --> 01:43:16,670
I'm gonna learn to read right now.

2781
01:43:17,590 --> 01:43:18,210
Wait, what?

2782
01:43:19,650 --> 01:43:20,850
I learned how to cook?

2783
01:43:22,490 --> 01:43:23,670
Is that what the book's for?

2784
01:43:25,050 --> 01:43:26,710
Did I just learn how to make food?

2785
01:43:28,810 --> 01:43:30,170
I... I guess I did.

2786
01:43:32,470 --> 01:43:33,950
Is that what happened?

2787
01:43:36,330 --> 01:43:38,290
I guess I learned how to cook.

2788
01:43:39,790 --> 01:43:40,110
What a dog!

2789
01:43:40,530 --> 01:43:42,150
It's all coming back to me now.

2790
01:43:42,610 --> 01:43:44,910
Dreamlike Valley used to be full of friends.

2791
01:43:45,710 --> 01:43:47,250
Like my pal, Remy.

2792
01:43:47,490 --> 01:43:50,050
My very, very good friend Remy.

2793
01:43:50,790 --> 01:43:52,670
He was always trying out new recipes!

2794
01:43:54,730 --> 01:43:57,450
And I was always HAPPY to taste him!

2795
01:43:57,750 --> 01:43:57,990
Haha!

2796
01:43:58,370 --> 01:43:59,310
Where is Manny?

2797
01:43:59,550 --> 01:44:00,450
And all this...

2798
01:44:00,450 --> 01:44:01,890
Well, we don't talk about her.

2799
01:44:02,150 --> 01:44:03,870
We try to talk about Minnie when I'm there.

2800
01:44:04,230 --> 01:44:04,750
Hahahaha!

2801
01:44:06,410 --> 01:44:07,850
I also remember...

2802
01:44:14,510 --> 01:44:18,310
Oh my god, he also lost Remy?!

2803
01:44:18,310 --> 01:44:19,770
Who's Remy?

2804
01:44:20,690 --> 01:44:22,610
Oh, Remy's a great chef.

2805
01:44:22,730 --> 01:44:24,610
Runs the best restaurant in town.

2806
01:44:25,110 --> 01:44:25,590
Oh gosh.

2807
01:44:26,470 --> 01:44:31,730
Or, he did until the night born started infesting Dream Life Valley.

2808
01:44:32,670 --> 01:44:36,850
I buried his recipes all over the valley to keep him safe.

2809
01:44:36,850 --> 01:44:39,630
Have you ever heard about a safety deposit box, Mickey?

2810
01:44:39,950 --> 01:44:41,290
Like, why would you?

2811
01:44:41,350 --> 01:44:44,430
Have you heard about, like, compiling it into a cookbook?

2812
01:44:47,470 --> 01:44:50,230
It, uh, well, it seemed like the best idea at the time.

2813
01:44:50,290 --> 01:44:50,670
Uh-huh.

2814
01:44:51,610 --> 01:44:53,050
Hey, I got an idea.

2815
01:44:53,750 --> 01:44:58,170
Remy's recipes could help you make meals to keep your energy up while you help save the valley.

2816
01:44:58,830 --> 01:45:01,090
There's one recipe we can get right now.

2817
01:45:01,450 --> 01:45:03,630
He was trying to forget him.

2818
01:45:03,770 --> 01:45:05,690
Yet he kept Minnie's backpack.

2819
01:45:07,010 --> 01:45:11,450
The memory you found should give us a clue as to where we could find the recipe.

2820
01:45:11,750 --> 01:45:12,870
Well, what do you know?

2821
01:45:13,030 --> 01:45:13,510
Alright.

2822
01:45:13,610 --> 01:45:16,730
I can access the collection menu of, oh!

2823
01:45:17,070 --> 01:45:20,190
Select an item to discover more info about it, alright.

2824
01:45:20,570 --> 01:45:26,390
Buh duh dum buh buh dum buh buh dum buh dum buh dum buh dum buh dum buh dum.

2825
01:45:26,410 --> 01:45:26,790
Oh!

2826
01:45:26,950 --> 01:45:27,310
Woah!

2827
01:45:27,510 --> 01:45:28,710
Alright, it's time to cook!

2828
01:45:31,050 --> 01:45:32,090
It's time...

2829
01:45:32,650 --> 01:45:33,670
...to cook?

2830
01:45:34,250 --> 01:45:34,710
Haha!

2831
01:45:35,850 --> 01:45:36,370
Oh!

2832
01:45:36,510 --> 01:45:36,830
Oh!

2833
01:45:37,670 --> 01:45:38,490
Oh, recipes.

2834
01:45:39,130 --> 01:45:41,350
Okay, I need bell pepper.

2835
01:45:41,610 --> 01:45:43,090
I don't have any of that, Mickey.

2836
01:45:44,010 --> 01:45:46,890
Mickey, how am I supposed to cook, Mickey?

2837
01:45:47,770 --> 01:45:50,370
You're supposed to provide me the stuff.

2838
01:45:54,190 --> 01:45:56,770
Mickey, how am I supposed to cook?

2839
01:45:58,070 --> 01:45:59,350
Mickey, stop running away.

2840
01:46:00,730 --> 01:46:02,570
Mickey, man, what should I do?

2841
01:46:02,570 --> 01:46:07,050
Well, now that we know what we're looking for, we have to just figure out where it is.

2842
01:46:07,430 --> 01:46:09,770
The memory should help us.

2843
01:46:10,690 --> 01:46:14,870
Where the fuck's... Oh, the memory with the chef.

2844
01:46:16,870 --> 01:46:19,310
Why do I have to find Mickey's stuff?

2845
01:46:19,410 --> 01:46:20,750
Mickey's the one that wants to eat.

2846
01:46:22,110 --> 01:46:23,050
He's just dancing.

2847
01:46:24,030 --> 01:46:25,350
He's just fucking dancing.

2848
01:46:26,510 --> 01:46:27,230
Mickey, help!

2849
01:46:28,670 --> 01:46:29,550
Where's my house?

2850
01:46:29,630 --> 01:46:30,450
I need to put stuff away.

2851
01:46:30,630 --> 01:46:32,430
I can't believe I have to actually put stuff away.

2852
01:46:33,190 --> 01:46:36,430
Jeff Bezos, how do I not have enough items, Jeff?

2853
01:46:39,730 --> 01:46:41,810
Alright, home sweet home.

2854
01:46:42,110 --> 01:46:45,950
Alright, we gotta, like, put some stuff away.

2855
01:46:46,270 --> 01:46:48,690
I don't have... apparently, I don't have enough money.

2856
01:46:53,290 --> 01:46:55,970
My storage is full?!

2857
01:46:55,970 --> 01:46:57,650
What's... okay.

2858
01:46:58,490 --> 01:47:00,650
This is a mess right now.

2859
01:47:00,730 --> 01:47:02,330
My storage is full!

2860
01:47:04,510 --> 01:47:06,170
Just stuff it all inside!

2861
01:47:08,190 --> 01:47:08,790
Alright.

2862
01:47:09,130 --> 01:47:13,710
We need to go to... where is that area, anyway?

2863
01:47:14,170 --> 01:47:15,030
Is it here?

2864
01:47:15,550 --> 01:47:16,330
Chef Remy!

2865
01:47:16,950 --> 01:47:17,890
There's the shovel!

2866
01:47:18,490 --> 01:47:19,810
The magic shovel!

2867
01:47:22,910 --> 01:47:23,510
Goddamn.

2868
01:47:23,530 --> 01:47:24,910
Every time I see his face.

2869
01:47:25,930 --> 01:47:26,890
Alright, nice.

2870
01:47:27,050 --> 01:47:27,530
Okay, tab.

2871
01:47:27,950 --> 01:47:30,270
And now, dig holes and remove obstacles.

2872
01:47:30,610 --> 01:47:31,630
What do I need to remove?

2873
01:47:31,730 --> 01:47:32,390
Like this?

2874
01:47:32,450 --> 01:47:32,550
What do I need to remove?

2875
01:47:32,550 --> 01:47:32,550
Like this?

2876
01:47:35,450 --> 01:47:38,490
Like, how do I... am I not using it?

2877
01:47:38,670 --> 01:47:39,030
Like...

2878
01:47:41,010 --> 01:47:41,450
Oh!

2879
01:47:42,950 --> 01:47:43,730
Okay, wait.

2880
01:47:44,090 --> 01:47:46,430
I can't... I can't remove it!

2881
01:47:47,770 --> 01:47:48,630
Oh, there it is.

2882
01:47:48,750 --> 01:47:49,570
Oh, there it is!

2883
01:47:50,850 --> 01:47:51,290
Nice.

2884
01:47:52,210 --> 01:47:52,890
What did I get?

2885
01:47:52,930 --> 01:47:53,430
I got rocks.

2886
01:47:54,170 --> 01:47:54,610
Nice.

2887
01:47:55,150 --> 01:47:57,830
Do I need to dig stuff back in, though?

2888
01:47:58,150 --> 01:47:59,210
I got more books!

2889
01:48:00,590 --> 01:48:01,470
Oh, no.

2890
01:48:01,570 --> 01:48:02,530
This village is gonna be...

2891
01:48:02,530 --> 01:48:03,450
We're gonna have some potholes.

2892
01:48:04,050 --> 01:48:07,190
I can't be bothered.

2893
01:48:07,530 --> 01:48:10,290
We're gonna have... we're gonna have potholes here.

2894
01:48:13,250 --> 01:48:14,330
Alright, nice.

2895
01:48:16,710 --> 01:48:17,990
But I'm here!

2896
01:48:19,250 --> 01:48:21,010
This is not where I have to go?

2897
01:48:22,770 --> 01:48:24,810
I need to get cheese and everything!

2898
01:48:26,230 --> 01:48:27,110
Oh, I need to explore.

2899
01:48:28,110 --> 01:48:29,110
Marlin, look!

2900
01:48:29,390 --> 01:48:29,950
I... what?

2901
01:48:30,990 --> 01:48:32,350
Where is it leading me?

2902
01:48:32,430 --> 01:48:33,290
Back to my home?

2903
01:48:33,870 --> 01:48:35,690
Why is it leading me back to my home?

2904
01:48:36,630 --> 01:48:38,050
I have so many questions.

2905
01:48:41,430 --> 01:48:41,870
Alright.

2906
01:48:43,190 --> 01:48:45,230
Why did it lead me back to my house?

2907
01:48:47,790 --> 01:48:48,790
Oh, yeah, the book!

2908
01:48:50,370 --> 01:48:51,850
I keep forgetting to read!

2909
01:48:53,990 --> 01:48:55,210
I can make a fruit salad!

2910
01:48:55,610 --> 01:48:56,750
Oh my god, thank god.

2911
01:48:56,930 --> 01:48:57,150
Okay.

2912
01:48:57,290 --> 01:48:57,910
Alright, Mickey!

2913
01:48:57,910 --> 01:49:00,430
I can now make a fruit salad!

2914
01:49:01,450 --> 01:49:02,770
Oh, boy, we did it!

2915
01:49:02,810 --> 01:49:03,770
We found the shovel!

2916
01:49:04,130 --> 01:49:05,310
And the recipe!

2917
01:49:05,530 --> 01:49:06,350
More, more!

2918
01:49:07,570 --> 01:49:08,530
Fruit salad?

2919
01:49:09,110 --> 01:49:10,230
Oh, hehe.

2920
01:49:11,410 --> 01:49:13,810
All this shovel over fruit salad?

2921
01:49:14,130 --> 01:49:15,510
That's right, Jeff, you tell him.

2922
01:49:16,250 --> 01:49:19,710
Is it like some kind of magic fruit salad or something?

2923
01:49:20,650 --> 01:49:23,610
Well, all of Remy's recipes taste magical.

2924
01:49:24,210 --> 01:49:25,770
Even the simple ones.

2925
01:49:25,770 --> 01:49:28,110
Oh, this is stuff you don't know.

2926
01:49:28,370 --> 01:49:30,370
Is this why Minnie left, Mickey?

2927
01:49:30,570 --> 01:49:31,910
Is that why she left?

2928
01:49:32,810 --> 01:49:37,210
And I bet if you keep looking, you'll find some recipes that are a bit more exciting.

2929
01:49:37,570 --> 01:49:41,030
I know Remy will trust you with his recipes.

2930
01:49:41,270 --> 01:49:43,930
And I'm pretty sure you'll like making him.

2931
01:49:46,650 --> 01:49:52,590
Hmm, if I find more of Remy's recipes, maybe I could start my own restaurant and get rich!

2932
01:49:53,930 --> 01:49:54,410
Haha!

2933
01:49:54,570 --> 01:49:55,050
Haha!

2934
01:49:55,050 --> 01:49:57,650
You sound like Donald's Uncle Scrooge!

2935
01:49:58,790 --> 01:50:04,090
Now, before you start collecting other recipes, we gotta make this one first!

2936
01:50:04,830 --> 01:50:09,090
First, we'll have to gather the ingredients, and I'll go see what I got in my garden!

2937
01:50:09,770 --> 01:50:11,990
Meet me there when you want to make the fruit salad!

2938
01:50:12,430 --> 01:50:15,730
It's been so long since I tasted one of Remy's recipes.

2939
01:50:16,090 --> 01:50:18,970
Has he ever said anything about Minnie this entire time?

2940
01:50:19,150 --> 01:50:20,970
It's been Remy this and Remy that.

2941
01:50:21,130 --> 01:50:24,590
He has not mentioned Minnie once in this entire scenario.

2942
01:50:25,050 --> 01:50:25,550
Oh,

2943
01:50:28,850 --> 01:50:34,350
and here's some overalls for you to wear if you want to look the part for what comes next!

2944
01:50:34,690 --> 01:50:35,210
Gardening!

2945
01:50:36,690 --> 01:50:37,270
Gardening?

2946
01:50:37,270 --> 01:50:38,650
That's what the maids do.

2947
01:50:40,050 --> 01:50:44,190
Select clothes to customize your... I don't need to customize my clothes.

2948
01:50:44,670 --> 01:50:46,730
I'm perfect the way I am.

2949
01:50:49,310 --> 01:50:51,070
Alright, I gardened.

2950
01:50:53,470 --> 01:50:54,810
Gosh, Chef Bezos!

2951
01:50:55,050 --> 01:50:57,010
There isn't much left of my garden!

2952
01:50:57,390 --> 01:50:58,130
Oh gosh!

2953
01:50:59,550 --> 01:51:00,330
It's a mess.

2954
01:51:00,990 --> 01:51:01,970
It sure is.

2955
01:51:02,650 --> 01:51:03,730
Minnie def- Oh!

2956
01:51:04,030 --> 01:51:04,850
Minnie mentioned!

2957
01:51:06,350 --> 01:51:09,110
Minnie definitely wouldn't be happy if she saw it like this.

2958
01:51:09,370 --> 01:51:10,570
She loves gardens.

2959
01:51:11,810 --> 01:51:18,050
Well, the sooner we make this recipe, the sooner we can make Dreamlight Valley a place she'll be proud of again.

2960
01:51:18,990 --> 01:51:19,510
Okay.

2961
01:51:19,950 --> 01:51:22,170
The recipe says to prepare the fruit salad.

2962
01:51:22,430 --> 01:51:24,110
We need fruit, like apples?

2963
01:51:24,110 --> 01:51:26,210
I bet you can find some around the village.

2964
01:51:26,570 --> 01:51:28,970
Oh, you know what would be great with a fruit salad?

2965
01:51:29,850 --> 01:51:30,810
Some crackers?

2966
01:51:32,110 --> 01:51:34,130
Who the fuck puts crack-

2967
01:51:37,690 --> 01:51:40,710
This is why you don't follow the recipes from a fucking rat.

2968
01:51:43,170 --> 01:51:48,390
You want to make crackers and fruit- Oh yeah, you want to make crackers and fruit salad?

2969
01:51:48,710 --> 01:51:50,050
That's so...

2970
01:51:52,170 --> 01:51:53,190
Not doll.

2971
01:51:53,310 --> 01:51:55,770
Not exactly like high-quiz-y.

2972
01:51:56,050 --> 01:51:57,590
Oh gosh.

2973
01:51:57,830 --> 01:52:00,350
Just because it's not fancy doesn't mean it's not good.

2974
01:52:01,690 --> 01:52:08,290
But to tell you the truth, the real reason I want to make crackers is because that's what Minnie used to make.

2975
01:52:10,290 --> 01:52:13,250
It's not the same as your pesos.

2976
01:52:16,710 --> 01:52:18,390
Remy is tiny.

2977
01:52:18,390 --> 01:52:22,010
But Minnie, she's like my size.

2978
01:52:23,590 --> 01:52:26,110
Guess I just wish she was here to make them now.

2979
01:52:27,690 --> 01:52:29,630
Mickey, are you okay?

2980
01:52:30,290 --> 01:52:31,770
Why the fuck?

2981
01:52:31,930 --> 01:52:34,170
Mickey, are you okay?

2982
01:52:35,210 --> 01:52:35,810
Me?

2983
01:52:36,370 --> 01:52:38,070
Oh, I'm fine.

2984
01:52:38,310 --> 01:52:39,590
I miss Minnie.

2985
01:52:39,890 --> 01:52:42,030
But it sure helps that you're here now.

2986
01:52:44,010 --> 01:52:44,610
Okay.

2987
01:52:45,150 --> 01:52:47,690
Minnie's crackers are super easy to bake.

2988
01:52:48,390 --> 01:52:50,050
They only take some wheat.

2989
01:52:50,710 --> 01:52:51,630
Here's the recipe.

2990
01:52:54,590 --> 01:52:56,090
Okay, I thought it said meat.

2991
01:52:56,210 --> 01:52:56,550
Yikes.

2992
01:52:56,890 --> 01:52:57,710
I forgot.

2993
01:52:57,950 --> 01:52:59,890
We'll have to start gardening before we can start cooking.

2994
01:53:00,310 --> 01:53:02,330
To get some wheat, we'll have to plant it.

2995
01:53:03,070 --> 01:53:04,570
Here's some seeds we can use.

2996
01:53:05,470 --> 01:53:05,970
Yay!

2997
01:53:09,030 --> 01:53:10,010
Cabbage, carrot.

2998
01:53:10,810 --> 01:53:14,190
It would be great to replace all those ugly thorns with some nice plants.

2999
01:53:14,910 --> 01:53:15,410
Alright.

3000
01:53:15,470 --> 01:53:16,570
Dig a garden.

3001
01:53:16,630 --> 01:53:17,610
Plant a seed.

3002
01:53:17,610 --> 01:53:18,650
Crops grow.

3003
01:53:18,970 --> 01:53:19,270
Alright.

3004
01:53:20,110 --> 01:53:20,950
Be gone.

3005
01:53:23,270 --> 01:53:24,090
Be gone.

3006
01:53:25,350 --> 01:53:27,510
Just like my ex-fiancee.

3007
01:53:27,510 --> 01:53:29,390
You gotta let her go, Vic.

3008
01:53:29,790 --> 01:53:30,430
Oooh.

3009
01:53:31,150 --> 01:53:34,190
Gee, you don't make crackers.

3010
01:53:34,270 --> 01:53:35,470
What the fuck?

3011
01:53:35,830 --> 01:53:38,470
I mean, I guess if Minnie made them, I guess.

3012
01:53:39,410 --> 01:53:40,270
That's crazy.

3013
01:53:40,370 --> 01:53:41,490
I was like, what?

3014
01:53:43,310 --> 01:53:43,950
Alright.

3015
01:53:45,950 --> 01:53:46,590
Okay.

3016
01:53:46,730 --> 01:53:47,150
Boom.

3017
01:53:47,790 --> 01:53:49,310
And then plant seed.

3018
01:53:50,050 --> 01:53:50,830
There we go.

3019
01:53:52,730 --> 01:53:53,210
Boom.

3020
01:53:54,690 --> 01:53:55,170
Okay.

3021
01:53:55,350 --> 01:53:56,810
How many does he want again?

3022
01:53:58,070 --> 01:53:58,970
Is it all five?

3023
01:54:01,350 --> 01:54:02,930
Oh, so that's what it was for.

3024
01:54:03,370 --> 01:54:03,850
Alright.

3025
01:54:03,930 --> 01:54:05,410
This beautiful garden of wheat.

3026
01:54:07,070 --> 01:54:07,550
Okay.

3027
01:54:09,130 --> 01:54:09,870
There we go.

3028
01:54:10,750 --> 01:54:11,930
That should be five.

3029
01:54:14,390 --> 01:54:15,510
That should be six.

3030
01:54:15,790 --> 01:54:16,770
Sorry, I can't numbers.

3031
01:54:17,210 --> 01:54:18,470
Cappy bird, get away!

3032
01:54:19,650 --> 01:54:20,050
Alright.

3033
01:54:20,150 --> 01:54:22,510
Oh, I can hold the plant mul- Okay, that's too late now.

3034
01:54:22,990 --> 01:54:25,910
Apparently, I could have held to plant multiple, but that's too late.

3035
01:54:26,730 --> 01:54:27,910
Alright, did the thing.

3036
01:54:30,990 --> 01:54:31,690
Oh, sorry.

3037
01:54:31,810 --> 01:54:32,390
I can't talk now.

3038
01:54:32,510 --> 01:54:35,070
I need to find the magic watering can.

3039
01:54:36,370 --> 01:54:38,750
Where the fuck is the magic watering can?

3040
01:54:41,230 --> 01:54:41,630
Merlin!

3041
01:54:45,090 --> 01:54:46,750
Where's the magic watering can?

3042
01:54:46,750 --> 01:54:52,050
Oh, I should grab the- I should grab some apples.

3043
01:54:52,250 --> 01:54:53,850
Harvest my apple now.

3044
01:54:54,590 --> 01:54:56,070
Maybe near the water?

3045
01:54:57,530 --> 01:54:59,190
You would expect so.

3046
01:54:59,370 --> 01:55:00,630
But like, it's not.

3047
01:55:03,470 --> 01:55:05,150
Like, there's the magic well.

3048
01:55:07,110 --> 01:55:07,750
Alright.

3049
01:55:07,810 --> 01:55:08,750
Let's see here.

3050
01:55:09,490 --> 01:55:11,770
Where could the magic watering can be?

3051
01:55:14,030 --> 01:55:19,010
I can't just ask me to do your fucking thing without telling me where the magic watering can is.

3052
01:55:19,830 --> 01:55:21,630
This town isn't even that big!

3053
01:55:25,270 --> 01:55:26,170
Why are you bald?

3054
01:55:26,310 --> 01:55:27,690
Because we're Jeff fucking Bezos.

3055
01:55:32,170 --> 01:55:33,610
He'll never grow hair.

3056
01:55:33,750 --> 01:55:36,990
The more hair he... if he grows hair, he loses his fortune.

3057
01:55:37,470 --> 01:55:40,310
That's the price he pays... to be a billionaire.

3058
01:55:41,770 --> 01:55:43,670
Okay, we can't go through here.

3059
01:55:45,150 --> 01:55:47,150
There's literally nowhere to go.

3060
01:55:47,810 --> 01:55:49,710
Oh, there's the magic pickaxe!

3061
01:55:53,990 --> 01:55:54,670
Yay!

3062
01:56:02,860 --> 01:56:04,220
And thus...

3063
01:56:04,980 --> 01:56:06,320
The sky...

3064
01:56:06,320 --> 01:56:07,720
And then it's morning?

3065
01:56:09,020 --> 01:56:11,780
The magic pickaxe destroyed the moon!

3066
01:56:12,980 --> 01:56:14,000
Like, what?

3067
01:56:17,640 --> 01:56:22,460
With this magic pickaxe, the moon shall be no more!

3068
01:56:26,320 --> 01:56:27,500
What the fuck?

3069
01:56:27,600 --> 01:56:29,760
Like, destroy the moon!

3070
01:56:32,680 --> 01:56:33,980
And then...

3071
01:56:34,500 --> 01:56:35,840
Bezos said...

3072
01:56:35,840 --> 01:56:37,660
Let there be light!

3073
01:56:39,820 --> 01:56:40,660
My word!

3074
01:56:40,800 --> 01:56:43,060
You pulled the pickaxe from the stone!

3075
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:45,380
I mined the moon!

3076
01:56:46,080 --> 01:56:47,040
Oh, and look!

3077
01:56:47,260 --> 01:56:50,980
Now that the enchanted pickaxe is in the hands of someone worthy again...

3078
01:56:50,980 --> 01:56:55,380
The blasted darkness that hung over the valley has finally disappeared!

3079
01:56:57,120 --> 01:56:59,980
Call me the hero of Dreamlight Valley.

3080
01:57:00,440 --> 01:57:00,860
Heheh.

3081
01:57:01,080 --> 01:57:04,380
No, I'm afraid one can't simply decide that they're a hero.

3082
01:57:04,620 --> 01:57:08,080
That's a title which must be bestowed upon you by your peers.

3083
01:57:08,540 --> 01:57:12,180
But I know you'll do many great deeds here and prove yourself worthy.

3084
01:57:12,480 --> 01:57:13,100
Mm-hmm.

3085
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:15,260
Now that the pickaxe...

3086
01:57:15,260 --> 01:57:19,740
Now, the pickaxe is just one of the tools that we all aid you on your journey.

3087
01:57:19,980 --> 01:57:26,760
Not only will it help you find gems, but you can use it to break through rocks and stones to explore the valley!

3088
01:57:27,080 --> 01:57:32,300
I see now that it's your destiny to bring great change to our valley.

3089
01:57:33,040 --> 01:57:34,160
What kind of change?

3090
01:57:34,320 --> 01:57:35,960
I like the village how it is!

3091
01:57:36,200 --> 01:57:36,960
Actually, no, I don't.

3092
01:57:37,020 --> 01:57:37,680
I want more people here.

3093
01:57:38,500 --> 01:57:40,400
Well, that's entirely in your hands.

3094
01:57:40,600 --> 01:57:42,480
You've already started on your journey!

3095
01:57:43,060 --> 01:57:43,540
Why?

3096
01:57:43,580 --> 01:57:43,900
Because...

3097
01:57:43,900 --> 01:57:47,220
Because of you, I'm remembering how dreamlike valley once was!

3098
01:57:47,400 --> 01:57:50,080
And how it came to be in the future.

3099
01:57:50,540 --> 01:57:52,520
We lost so much, you know?

3100
01:57:52,760 --> 01:57:57,020
Not just memories and tools, but magic and friendship too.

3101
01:57:57,960 --> 01:58:01,620
Those of us who stayed when the forgetting began have been scattered.

3102
01:58:01,900 --> 01:58:03,200
Some are even trapped!

3103
01:58:03,820 --> 01:58:05,860
It's up to you to find them!

3104
01:58:06,540 --> 01:58:07,220
Alright, nice.

3105
01:58:07,980 --> 01:58:11,040
With my giant-ass pickaxe...

3106
01:58:11,040 --> 01:58:13,260
I shall save the world!

3107
01:58:13,800 --> 01:58:16,740
But where is the magic watering can?

3108
01:58:19,140 --> 01:58:22,580
I am literally missing the magic watering can, Merlin.

3109
01:58:22,900 --> 01:58:23,800
What the fuck?

3110
01:58:23,840 --> 01:58:27,540
How do I progress in this quest if I can't water?

3111
01:58:28,580 --> 01:58:31,020
Like... what do you want me to do?

3112
01:58:34,660 --> 01:58:36,780
I'm trying to water!

3113
01:58:38,200 --> 01:58:39,280
You know what?

3114
01:58:39,280 --> 01:58:41,060
Okay, I thought I could like...

3115
01:58:41,060 --> 01:58:43,000
I thought I could like... destroy that rock.

3116
01:58:44,320 --> 01:58:45,560
Oh my god!

3117
01:58:46,160 --> 01:58:48,100
I'm literally just...

3118
01:58:48,100 --> 01:58:48,700
You know what?

3119
01:58:48,760 --> 01:58:49,040
Fuck this.

3120
01:58:49,140 --> 01:58:49,620
I'm gonna...

3121
01:58:50,280 --> 01:58:51,140
Fuck this rock!

3122
01:58:53,660 --> 01:58:55,520
Oh my god, I got new crafting materials!

3123
01:58:56,880 --> 01:58:59,840
Maybe there's like... the magic watering can is somewhere here.

3124
01:59:00,340 --> 01:59:01,180
Down here.

3125
01:59:01,960 --> 01:59:02,500
Hello?

3126
01:59:02,680 --> 01:59:03,580
Is there any magic?

3127
01:59:04,500 --> 01:59:05,380
Any magic?

3128
01:59:05,900 --> 01:59:07,180
Oh hey, what's this?

3129
01:59:09,700 --> 01:59:10,220
What's this?

3130
01:59:10,340 --> 01:59:10,980
It's another memory.

3131
01:59:16,240 --> 01:59:17,680
I'm using Rivalry lately.

3132
01:59:18,220 --> 01:59:21,660
Scrooge camped for the life of him to figure out why Goofy's stall is more profitable.

3133
01:59:22,480 --> 01:59:27,400
Goofy started trying to help and that's going about as funnily as Goofy's help always does.

3134
01:59:28,020 --> 01:59:30,400
Oh my god, Goofy was like the secret...

3135
01:59:30,940 --> 01:59:32,300
Uh... wait, you saw the watering can?

3136
01:59:32,740 --> 01:59:33,560
Wait, is that it?

3137
01:59:34,780 --> 01:59:35,740
No, that's not it.

3138
01:59:35,920 --> 01:59:38,080
Where the fuck is the magic watering can?

3139
01:59:38,380 --> 01:59:39,340
Where's the magic...

3140
01:59:39,340 --> 01:59:40,600
Oh, there's the magic fishing rod.

3141
01:59:40,600 --> 01:59:43,540
And thus I can fish now!

3142
01:59:44,260 --> 01:59:45,580
I'm gonna start fishing.

3143
01:59:46,320 --> 01:59:47,340
Jeffrey Bezos.

3144
01:59:48,920 --> 01:59:50,660
Wait, I can't?

3145
01:59:50,660 --> 01:59:53,000
I can't just learn... I can't just fish?

3146
01:59:53,780 --> 01:59:54,800
Oh my god.

3147
01:59:55,280 --> 01:59:58,080
I have to find Goofy to fish?

3148
01:59:58,620 --> 01:59:59,700
That's stupid.

3149
01:59:59,960 --> 02:00:00,340
That's...

3150
02:00:01,940 --> 02:00:03,140
That's fucking stupid.

3151
02:00:03,700 --> 02:00:05,520
I'm Jeffrey Bezos!

3152
02:00:06,860 --> 02:00:09,680
Why are you trying to say that I'm stupid?

3153
02:00:10,600 --> 02:00:12,120
I can't... do fishing myself?

3154
02:00:12,520 --> 02:00:14,500
That I need a dog to teach me how to fish?

3155
02:00:14,980 --> 02:00:18,840
You need the power of magic to learn to fish.

3156
02:00:19,280 --> 02:00:20,480
That's fucking stupid.

3157
02:00:24,360 --> 02:00:24,960
Alright.

3158
02:00:25,420 --> 02:00:26,740
And thus...

3159
02:00:27,480 --> 02:00:28,400
I dig.

3160
02:00:29,900 --> 02:00:30,200
Boom.

3161
02:00:30,920 --> 02:00:33,160
I like how it just takes one hit.

3162
02:00:33,260 --> 02:00:33,920
Oh, I'm tired.

3163
02:00:35,780 --> 02:00:37,880
I'm not used to physical labor.

3164
02:00:40,840 --> 02:00:41,400
Sorry.

3165
02:00:42,320 --> 02:00:42,880
Usually...

3166
02:00:43,740 --> 02:00:46,580
Usually, somebody else does this for me.

3167
02:00:47,180 --> 02:00:47,840
Wait, is the...

3168
02:00:47,840 --> 02:00:48,300
Could the...

3169
02:00:48,300 --> 02:00:50,040
Maybe the magic...

3170
02:00:50,040 --> 02:00:53,080
Maybe the magic watering can is here!

3171
02:00:56,260 --> 02:00:56,820
Okay.

3172
02:00:59,100 --> 02:00:59,900
That's a chest.

3173
02:01:00,800 --> 02:01:02,020
Maybe it's here?

3174
02:01:03,840 --> 02:01:04,500
Maybe it's here.

3175
02:01:04,620 --> 02:01:06,260
Am I gonna pass out if I'm too tired?

3176
02:01:07,480 --> 02:01:08,700
No, it's just a rock.

3177
02:01:10,600 --> 02:01:10,840
What's this?

3178
02:01:11,800 --> 02:01:13,480
It's not a magic watering can.

3179
02:01:13,820 --> 02:01:14,340
Guys!

3180
02:01:14,940 --> 02:01:17,120
Where's the magic water...

3181
02:01:17,120 --> 02:01:20,080
You guys think I don't wanna progress this mission.

3182
02:01:20,300 --> 02:01:22,160
Where the fuck is the magic watering can?

3183
02:01:22,680 --> 02:01:25,120
Where's that one guy that's played this game?

3184
02:01:25,380 --> 02:01:25,600
I...

3185
02:01:28,760 --> 02:01:32,040
There has to be one of you that's played this game.

3186
02:01:35,780 --> 02:01:38,840
The plaza is the heart of Dreamlight Valley.

3187
02:01:38,840 --> 02:01:45,560
It's where all the Valley citizens come together to help each other when needed and celebrate whenever we have an excuse.

3188
02:01:46,060 --> 02:01:47,380
Oh my god, please.

3189
02:01:47,740 --> 02:01:48,960
Please, I just...

3190
02:01:48,960 --> 02:01:50,860
I have all the magical tools.

3191
02:01:51,180 --> 02:01:53,680
Except for the fucking magic watering can!

3192
02:01:55,460 --> 02:01:57,520
Maybe somebody said it could be behind my house.

3193
02:01:57,880 --> 02:01:59,760
There's a behind in my house?

3194
02:02:00,720 --> 02:02:01,640
No, that's a chest.

3195
02:02:02,360 --> 02:02:03,520
Oh, there it is!

3196
02:02:03,540 --> 02:02:04,120
I see it!

3197
02:02:05,020 --> 02:02:06,160
Why is it here?

3198
02:02:07,260 --> 02:02:08,160
What the fuck?

3199
02:02:08,160 --> 02:02:09,820
Who put the magic watering can here?

3200
02:02:13,700 --> 02:02:14,960
Yes, I did it!

3201
02:02:15,020 --> 02:02:16,960
The watering can has been unlocked!

3202
02:02:18,060 --> 02:02:19,540
Thank fucking god.

3203
02:02:20,040 --> 02:02:22,500
I like how it's the pickaxe that like...

3204
02:02:23,500 --> 02:02:25,900
That like brought the day back.

3205
02:02:26,260 --> 02:02:27,620
Everything else doesn't matter.

3206
02:02:28,140 --> 02:02:28,700
Alright.

3207
02:02:28,960 --> 02:02:30,420
The magic watering can.

3208
02:02:31,940 --> 02:02:34,340
Eat some food or go back to your house.

3209
02:02:34,440 --> 02:02:35,340
God damn it!

3210
02:02:37,280 --> 02:02:39,440
What if I like just pass out?

3211
02:02:41,080 --> 02:02:42,080
Oh no, I can't.

3212
02:02:42,140 --> 02:02:43,180
Sorry, I'm EP, Mickey.

3213
02:02:43,520 --> 02:02:44,260
I mean...

3214
02:02:45,060 --> 02:02:45,800
I'm kidding.

3215
02:02:47,920 --> 02:02:49,020
Sorry, Mickey.

3216
02:02:49,140 --> 02:02:50,100
I'm EP now.

3217
02:02:50,240 --> 02:02:51,440
That's all it takes?

3218
02:02:52,080 --> 02:02:53,160
That's literally...

3219
02:02:53,160 --> 02:02:55,580
Now sync to real time.

3220
02:02:57,000 --> 02:02:57,560
What?

3221
02:02:58,740 --> 02:03:00,320
Okay, your time will change.

3222
02:03:00,460 --> 02:03:02,360
The characters will follow their own schedule.

3223
02:03:02,920 --> 02:03:04,400
Make sure to come back...

3224
02:03:04,400 --> 02:03:05,320
Wait, that's pretty funny.

3225
02:03:05,320 --> 02:03:08,640
So they have like their own schedule and everything.

3226
02:03:08,820 --> 02:03:09,680
They have their own AI.

3227
02:03:11,200 --> 02:03:12,600
Oh, that's convenient.

3228
02:03:13,120 --> 02:03:15,080
Oh, now you are alive.

3229
02:03:15,580 --> 02:03:16,860
Alright, did the thing, Mickey.

3230
02:03:19,840 --> 02:03:20,960
What do I do now?

3231
02:03:22,900 --> 02:03:24,380
What do I do now?

3232
02:03:24,480 --> 02:03:25,020
Do I wait?

3233
02:03:25,680 --> 02:03:26,860
Do I fucking wait?

3234
02:03:27,100 --> 02:03:28,700
Like, why did I...

3235
02:03:28,700 --> 02:03:31,740
Use it to learn the crackers recipe?

3236
02:03:32,040 --> 02:03:33,820
Did I not learn the crackers recipe?

3237
02:03:36,020 --> 02:03:37,100
What the fuck?

3238
02:03:38,560 --> 02:03:40,600
Oh my god, keep forgetting to read.

3239
02:03:40,940 --> 02:03:42,800
I keep forgetting to read.

3240
02:03:43,440 --> 02:03:45,900
Alright, I learned the crackers recipe, Mickey.

3241
02:03:46,060 --> 02:03:46,740
I did it.

3242
02:03:47,040 --> 02:03:48,660
I finally learned to read.

3243
02:03:49,440 --> 02:03:51,580
Great, now we need to water them before they dry out.

3244
02:03:51,760 --> 02:03:54,100
Minnie always says to pay attention to the leaves on the plant.

3245
02:03:54,420 --> 02:03:56,400
They'll let you know when it's time to water.

3246
02:03:56,900 --> 02:03:59,400
I'm glad you found the royal watering can.

3247
02:04:00,240 --> 02:04:02,180
That'll be real helpful when you're gardening.

3248
02:04:03,120 --> 02:04:04,720
Give it a try, Jeff Bezos.

3249
02:04:05,660 --> 02:04:06,500
Oh gosh.

3250
02:04:08,720 --> 02:04:10,720
I just... I just watered it.

3251
02:04:11,040 --> 02:04:11,660
Did I...

3252
02:04:11,660 --> 02:04:12,860
What the fuck?

3253
02:04:15,820 --> 02:04:17,160
Oh, okay, I did it.

3254
02:04:17,460 --> 02:04:18,400
Alright, harvest.

3255
02:04:18,820 --> 02:04:21,280
Harvest, harvest, harvest, harvest, harvest.

3256
02:04:24,160 --> 02:04:25,740
Mickey, I got the...

3257
02:04:25,740 --> 02:04:26,780
Goofy!

3258
02:04:30,440 --> 02:04:31,900
Where did he come from?

3259
02:04:32,100 --> 02:04:33,540
How did you get here?

3260
02:04:34,140 --> 02:04:34,700
How did you get here?

3261
02:04:34,700 --> 02:04:35,840
How the fuck did you get here?

3262
02:04:38,500 --> 02:04:39,840
Where did you come from?

3263
02:04:40,660 --> 02:04:41,380
Hi there, pal.

3264
02:04:42,060 --> 02:04:43,820
Gosh, it's somebody new.

3265
02:04:45,320 --> 02:04:48,140
Say, you're not the scary kind of stranger, are you?

3266
02:04:48,400 --> 02:04:49,640
You're just a friend.

3267
02:04:50,100 --> 02:04:51,660
I haven't met yet, right?

3268
02:04:53,140 --> 02:04:54,260
Of course I'm a...

3269
02:04:54,260 --> 02:04:55,760
I guess I can be a little scared.

3270
02:04:56,260 --> 02:04:58,140
Of course I'm your friend, Goofy.

3271
02:05:00,940 --> 02:05:01,900
That's reassuring.

3272
02:05:01,900 --> 02:05:05,680
It's been a real long time since I've seen everybody else.

3273
02:05:05,820 --> 02:05:06,380
Gosh.

3274
02:05:06,600 --> 02:05:07,320
Oh gosh.

3275
02:05:07,980 --> 02:05:13,900
I've been waiting for somebody to come along ever since the sky got dark and the night thorns crept in.

3276
02:05:15,440 --> 02:05:16,940
But now you're here.

3277
02:05:18,400 --> 02:05:18,960
Yuck.

3278
02:05:19,400 --> 02:05:19,960
Yuck.

3279
02:05:20,960 --> 02:05:22,500
We're gonna be good pals.

3280
02:05:22,780 --> 02:05:24,440
I just know it.

3281
02:05:24,900 --> 02:05:26,740
If that ain't too foreign...

3282
02:05:26,740 --> 02:05:27,060
Yuck.

3283
02:05:27,880 --> 02:05:30,000
Gee, there's so much I wanna show ya.

3284
02:05:30,400 --> 02:05:31,520
There's my stall.

3285
02:05:31,640 --> 02:05:31,880
There's my stall.

3286
02:05:31,900 --> 02:05:33,280
We'll have to clean...

3287
02:05:33,280 --> 02:05:33,360
No!

3288
02:05:33,560 --> 02:05:34,420
He's sad!

3289
02:05:35,440 --> 02:05:36,420
But where's Donald?

3290
02:05:37,340 --> 02:05:40,320
Cause I, of course, I had to find my lucky fishing rod.

3291
02:05:40,800 --> 02:05:42,180
Slow down, Goofy.

3292
02:05:42,200 --> 02:05:44,160
I think I already found your fishing rod.

3293
02:05:44,560 --> 02:05:45,620
Only one problem.

3294
02:05:45,760 --> 02:05:47,020
It seems to be broken.

3295
02:05:49,580 --> 02:05:50,260
Minus one.

3296
02:05:51,640 --> 02:05:52,140
Thanks!

3297
02:05:52,920 --> 02:05:53,760
Oh gosh!

3298
02:05:54,180 --> 02:05:55,380
Thanks, Jeff Bezos!

3299
02:05:55,520 --> 02:05:56,320
Let me see.

3300
02:05:58,420 --> 02:06:00,420
Oh, it was just jammed up with seaweed.

3301
02:06:00,720 --> 02:06:01,880
But it's all fixed now.

3302
02:06:01,880 --> 02:06:03,680
Tell ya what.

3303
02:06:03,820 --> 02:06:10,160
Now that I have my lucky fishing rod back, I'll give you this one I found after forgetting so we can fish together.

3304
02:06:10,880 --> 02:06:13,020
I think it belonged to our old ruler.

3305
02:06:13,320 --> 02:06:14,080
Hey, look!

3306
02:06:14,220 --> 02:06:15,240
It seems to like you.

3307
02:06:15,360 --> 02:06:17,820
Wait, am I the old ruler that just happens to forgot?

3308
02:06:18,760 --> 02:06:20,620
Because I'm so magical.

3309
02:06:21,620 --> 02:06:22,900
That must be it.

3310
02:06:23,020 --> 02:06:24,680
You do seem pretty magical.

3311
02:06:25,560 --> 02:06:26,700
Well, here you go.

3312
02:06:26,880 --> 02:06:28,020
It's all yours.

3313
02:06:29,680 --> 02:06:30,180
This.

3314
02:06:30,900 --> 02:06:31,860
I got my magic wand.

3315
02:06:31,860 --> 02:06:33,660
My magic fishing rod.

3316
02:06:34,260 --> 02:06:35,300
King Bezos.

3317
02:06:35,660 --> 02:06:39,940
And here's a goofy hat so you can look like a real angler.

3318
02:06:40,440 --> 02:06:41,900
Oh my god, I got a fishing hat.

3319
02:06:42,580 --> 02:06:43,960
What do you think of that hat?

3320
02:06:44,080 --> 02:06:45,080
Pretty spiffy, huh?

3321
02:06:46,560 --> 02:06:47,660
It's a bit...

3322
02:06:47,660 --> 02:06:48,620
goofy.

3323
02:06:50,080 --> 02:06:50,780
Oh, yeah.

3324
02:06:50,840 --> 02:06:52,500
That's what's so great about it.

3325
02:06:53,300 --> 02:06:56,180
Alrighty, let me show you how to use your new fishing rod.

3326
02:06:56,900 --> 02:06:57,640
Oh, nice.

3327
02:06:57,960 --> 02:07:00,000
My magic fishing rod!

3328
02:07:01,860 --> 02:07:03,580
And thus I learn...

3329
02:07:03,580 --> 02:07:05,820
And thus the world learn how to fish.

3330
02:07:06,260 --> 02:07:07,660
Hold to cast your line.

3331
02:07:07,980 --> 02:07:08,520
Okay.

3332
02:07:08,640 --> 02:07:09,480
That seems easy.

3333
02:07:10,080 --> 02:07:11,680
Alright, I need to learn...

3334
02:07:11,680 --> 02:07:13,180
Sorry Merlin, I'm gonna go fish.

3335
02:07:14,820 --> 02:07:15,680
It's time.

3336
02:07:16,600 --> 02:07:18,100
It's time to fish.

3337
02:07:18,940 --> 02:07:19,940
This is it.

3338
02:07:20,060 --> 02:07:21,380
Watch me fish.

3339
02:07:22,020 --> 02:07:24,060
Alright, hold to cast your line.

3340
02:07:25,140 --> 02:07:29,860
Press left click button quickly every time the circle turns green.

3341
02:07:30,300 --> 02:07:31,360
Okay, that's easy.

3342
02:07:38,220 --> 02:07:38,980
Phew.

3343
02:07:40,100 --> 02:07:40,860
Oh.

3344
02:07:42,660 --> 02:07:43,420
Oh!

3345
02:07:43,720 --> 02:07:44,720
This is easy.

3346
02:07:44,920 --> 02:07:45,380
Oh!

3347
02:07:47,140 --> 02:07:48,680
Okay, this is easy.

3348
02:07:51,240 --> 02:07:52,720
Goofy is watching me fish.

3349
02:07:55,960 --> 02:07:56,340
Oh.

3350
02:07:57,040 --> 02:07:57,760
Oh.

3351
02:07:58,080 --> 02:07:58,600
Yeah!

3352
02:08:01,640 --> 02:08:02,400
Goofy!

3353
02:08:02,860 --> 02:08:04,500
God, I'm a natural.

3354
02:08:05,540 --> 02:08:06,960
Bezos the cat.

3355
02:08:07,340 --> 02:08:08,720
Oh, what do you know?

3356
02:08:08,760 --> 02:08:09,580
You're a natural.

3357
02:08:12,460 --> 02:08:14,880
What do I do with this?

3358
02:08:15,220 --> 02:08:16,900
Gosh, lots of things.

3359
02:08:17,140 --> 02:08:18,560
You can cook it for a meal.

3360
02:08:18,940 --> 02:08:21,120
Or you can sell your fish at my stall.

3361
02:08:21,300 --> 02:08:23,440
As soon as we get it reopened, that is.

3362
02:08:24,440 --> 02:08:24,880
Yay!

3363
02:08:26,120 --> 02:08:27,180
I did it!

3364
02:08:28,640 --> 02:08:30,340
Alright, how do we fix your stall?

3365
02:08:31,280 --> 02:08:33,720
Gosh, I guess it's a little more run down than I thought.

3366
02:08:33,900 --> 02:08:34,660
But that's okay.

3367
02:08:35,200 --> 02:08:38,100
Under Scrooge's construction company can fix it right up.

3368
02:08:38,320 --> 02:08:39,800
Use the sign to call him.

3369
02:08:39,800 --> 02:08:41,100
Oh shit!

3370
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:42,560
Scrooge!

3371
02:08:44,040 --> 02:08:46,680
It's about time Goofy fixed this place up.

3372
02:08:47,080 --> 02:08:49,200
I'm glad he's got you to help.

3373
02:08:49,380 --> 02:08:51,240
Now let's get down to business.

3374
02:08:52,220 --> 02:08:54,780
Goofy can have this stall at no extra cost.

3375
02:08:55,040 --> 02:08:56,600
Since the family needs it.

3376
02:08:56,840 --> 02:08:58,900
But next time, I won't be generous.

3377
02:08:59,240 --> 02:09:00,060
What say ya?

3378
02:09:00,280 --> 02:09:01,240
What say ye?

3379
02:09:02,040 --> 02:09:03,340
Alright, let's fix the stall.

3380
02:09:03,920 --> 02:09:06,200
Goofy's stall is now open for business!

3381
02:09:06,420 --> 02:09:07,480
That was fast.

3382
02:09:07,820 --> 02:09:09,780
If you see another property you're interested in...

3383
02:09:09,800 --> 02:09:11,380
Don't hesitate to let me know!

3384
02:09:11,660 --> 02:09:13,960
Simply go to the sign next to it.

3385
02:09:14,300 --> 02:09:15,200
Oh shit!

3386
02:09:15,360 --> 02:09:16,140
That's fast.

3387
02:09:16,540 --> 02:09:17,560
Who does this?

3388
02:09:17,660 --> 02:09:18,720
Is it just Scrooge?

3389
02:09:20,200 --> 02:09:23,660
Oh, it's... I can buy like cabbages and seeds.

3390
02:09:24,360 --> 02:09:29,180
Be active in the valley, gather... sell what you don't need and receive coins.

3391
02:09:29,660 --> 02:09:30,400
Alright, cool.

3392
02:09:30,740 --> 02:09:31,560
Is that it?

3393
02:09:32,060 --> 02:09:33,640
I can upgrade it?

3394
02:09:34,780 --> 02:09:38,480
Goofy could buy and sell more products so you can make more improvements?

3395
02:09:38,720 --> 02:09:38,980
No.

3396
02:09:39,800 --> 02:09:41,720
But this is a sound investment!

3397
02:09:42,100 --> 02:09:43,620
Well come back here when...

3398
02:09:43,620 --> 02:09:44,520
No, what the fuck?

3399
02:09:44,680 --> 02:09:45,640
Why would I need...

3400
02:09:45,640 --> 02:09:46,740
Wait, I need to talk to you.

3401
02:09:46,740 --> 02:09:47,680
Scrooge, get back here!

3402
02:09:47,740 --> 02:09:48,020
Scrooge!

3403
02:09:48,140 --> 02:09:49,100
Scrooge, get back here!

3404
02:09:49,500 --> 02:09:49,960
I need...

3405
02:09:50,620 --> 02:09:51,800
You have a mission!

3406
02:09:52,060 --> 02:09:53,500
I need to talk to you!

3407
02:09:58,380 --> 02:10:00,440
Well done, Jeff Bezos.

3408
02:10:00,780 --> 02:10:04,400
With Goofy back in business, you can make more money!

3409
02:10:05,200 --> 02:10:08,540
Then, when you're ready to invest in my grand reopening...

3410
02:10:08,540 --> 02:10:09,680
Come find myself!

3411
02:10:11,200 --> 02:10:13,720
I have to invest in your store?

3412
02:10:15,380 --> 02:10:16,580
Are you ready to invest?

3413
02:10:17,000 --> 02:10:19,820
There will be all sorts of furniture and clothing to purchase.

3414
02:10:20,100 --> 02:10:22,040
And trust me or my name...

3415
02:10:22,040 --> 02:10:23,500
A THOUSAND QUART!

3416
02:10:23,640 --> 02:10:24,020
Yeah, no.

3417
02:10:24,600 --> 02:10:26,740
Do I even have a thousand quart?

3418
02:10:26,800 --> 02:10:27,900
I'm gonna talk to fucking Merlin.

3419
02:10:28,100 --> 02:10:28,740
Fuck that shit.

3420
02:10:29,120 --> 02:10:29,220
Hello!

3421
02:10:29,700 --> 02:10:30,260
Bravo!

3422
02:10:30,680 --> 02:10:32,520
Well done, Jeff Bezos!

3423
02:10:33,340 --> 02:10:37,960
Not only have you driven back the darkness that was hanging over the village...

3424
02:10:37,960 --> 02:10:38,620
But...

3425
02:10:38,620 --> 02:10:41,640
You found all the tools that were left by our previous ruler!

3426
02:10:42,020 --> 02:10:46,160
With their enchantments, you're well armed to face what lies ahead.

3427
02:10:47,280 --> 02:10:50,620
The pickaxe can only be wielded by one who is worthy.

3428
02:10:50,820 --> 02:10:52,580
Which you most certainly are.

3429
02:10:53,000 --> 02:10:56,180
In your hands, it will split rocks with just a swing.

3430
02:10:56,500 --> 02:10:59,740
The watering can never needs to be refilled.

3431
02:10:59,880 --> 02:11:02,640
It will speed up the growing process for crops.

3432
02:11:02,880 --> 02:11:05,200
And keep all the blooms here healthy.

3433
02:11:05,620 --> 02:11:07,620
The fishing rod needs no bait.

3434
02:11:07,620 --> 02:11:08,380
And never...

3435
02:11:08,380 --> 02:11:09,000
Oh my god!

3436
02:11:09,080 --> 02:11:10,360
That's why they're all magical!

3437
02:11:11,620 --> 02:11:13,640
As for the shovel...

3438
02:11:13,640 --> 02:11:15,440
Well, it's just a shovel.

3439
02:11:15,720 --> 02:11:16,140
What?

3440
02:11:16,780 --> 02:11:18,660
I literally destroyed the moon!

3441
02:11:19,920 --> 02:11:22,500
It is not just a shovel, Merlin!

3442
02:11:22,820 --> 02:11:24,680
I destroyed the moon!

3443
02:11:26,580 --> 02:11:28,140
But a very good one.

3444
02:11:28,400 --> 02:11:32,240
You'll need it for guarding and finding objects hidden in the ground around the valley.

3445
02:11:32,560 --> 02:11:34,740
Now that you've found all the royal tools...

3446
02:11:34,740 --> 02:11:37,000
The wishing well is sensing your newfound powers.

3447
02:11:37,000 --> 02:11:43,000
Be ready to take on the well's duty and collect the dreamlight needed to remove the nightthorns from the castle door.

3448
02:11:43,900 --> 02:11:46,060
Let's start with how it all works.

3449
02:11:46,220 --> 02:11:49,300
Gaze into the well to see what the valley needs.

3450
02:11:49,820 --> 02:11:53,920
Completing even the simplest tasks will bring great change and help end the forgetting.

3451
02:11:54,480 --> 02:11:58,560
As long as they're done in a spirit of love, care, and friendship.

3452
02:12:01,060 --> 02:12:05,380
Then, once you get enough dreamlight to remove those pesky nightthorns from the castle...

3453
02:12:05,380 --> 02:12:06,440
Come and find me!

3454
02:12:07,740 --> 02:12:08,380
Yay!

3455
02:12:08,380 --> 02:12:09,780
I'm level two!

3456
02:12:12,360 --> 02:12:13,000
Yay!

3457
02:12:15,760 --> 02:12:18,980
Jesus Christ, this is a very grindy game.

3458
02:12:19,440 --> 02:12:20,480
I've noticed.

3459
02:12:23,420 --> 02:12:26,300
Oh my god, this game is actually...

3460
02:12:26,560 --> 02:12:26,900
Oh, stop!

3461
02:12:27,140 --> 02:12:28,740
I don't want to keep petting you, Capybara!

3462
02:12:28,860 --> 02:12:30,900
I'm trying to check the dream!

3463
02:12:31,680 --> 02:12:32,960
Alright, foraging.

3464
02:12:34,160 --> 02:12:35,340
I got this.

3465
02:12:35,680 --> 02:12:36,700
How many fucking...

3466
02:12:37,000 --> 02:12:38,720
Dream things do I need, anyway?

3467
02:12:40,200 --> 02:12:42,360
Who are some of the villagers here?

3468
02:12:43,320 --> 02:12:44,700
Oh, there's Mirabelle.

3469
02:12:44,880 --> 02:12:46,600
I like how there's only Mirabelle.

3470
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:49,940
Wait, what's this game's last update?

3471
02:12:50,480 --> 02:12:51,920
Where's Donald Duck?

3472
02:12:52,180 --> 02:12:53,860
I want Donald in my...

3473
02:12:53,860 --> 02:12:55,300
I don't care about Minnie.

3474
02:12:56,460 --> 02:12:58,080
What the fuck is wrong?

3475
02:12:58,780 --> 02:13:00,700
There's something wrong with Maui's model.

3476
02:13:00,840 --> 02:13:01,560
There's something.

3477
02:13:03,420 --> 02:13:04,440
New 2000?

3478
02:13:04,920 --> 02:13:06,500
That's a lot of dreamlight.

3479
02:13:07,000 --> 02:13:08,700
Why is mother...

3480
02:13:08,700 --> 02:13:10,760
What about Rapunzel?

3481
02:13:11,640 --> 02:13:12,640
What about...

3482
02:13:12,640 --> 02:13:13,960
Why are the lions here?

3483
02:13:14,800 --> 02:13:16,900
I like how the lions are here, too.

3484
02:13:17,580 --> 02:13:20,680
Tim Burton's, Wally, Mike Wachowski.

3485
02:13:20,860 --> 02:13:22,720
Yeah, it was in Wreck-It Ralph.

3486
02:13:22,960 --> 02:13:25,780
I like how it's... Vanellope's there, when the move...

3487
02:13:25,780 --> 02:13:27,560
When Ralph himself is not there.

3488
02:13:27,780 --> 02:13:28,320
Uh...

3489
02:13:31,360 --> 02:13:31,960
Alright.

3490
02:13:33,620 --> 02:13:34,560
Let's see.

3491
02:13:34,560 --> 02:13:37,100
What even are the rest of my missions?

3492
02:13:38,760 --> 02:13:40,120
Use the water...

3493
02:13:40,120 --> 02:13:41,520
I have to do it again?

3494
02:13:42,460 --> 02:13:44,400
Oh no, I glitched it.

3495
02:13:44,660 --> 02:13:45,760
Oh no.

3496
02:13:45,880 --> 02:13:46,900
I... I...

3497
02:13:46,900 --> 02:13:50,660
I watered the plants before they were supposed to be...

3498
02:13:50,660 --> 02:13:51,960
Oh no!

3499
02:13:55,630 --> 02:13:56,910
Mickey's quest.

3500
02:13:57,390 --> 02:14:00,990
I... I sequence broke the Mickey quest.

3501
02:14:01,370 --> 02:14:04,770
I actually sequence broke it.

3502
02:14:15,290 --> 02:14:17,650
I can't believe it!

3503
02:14:17,810 --> 02:14:21,230
I actually sequence broke it!

3504
02:14:21,590 --> 02:14:22,750
Oh no!

3505
02:14:24,710 --> 02:14:25,470
Alright.

3506
02:14:25,670 --> 02:14:27,570
I think this is a good time to call it today.

3507
02:14:30,350 --> 02:14:34,770
The adventures of Jeff Bezos will have to stop here.

3508
02:14:35,110 --> 02:14:36,950
But before we do...

3509
02:14:37,850 --> 02:14:39,130
Let's take a picture.

3510
02:14:40,730 --> 02:14:41,490
Wait.

3511
02:14:41,710 --> 02:14:42,170
No.

3512
02:14:42,290 --> 02:14:42,890
Change.

3513
02:14:43,870 --> 02:14:44,830
Move camera.

3514
02:14:45,010 --> 02:14:45,730
Move camera.

3515
02:14:46,590 --> 02:14:47,070
Hello?

3516
02:14:47,570 --> 02:14:48,050
Hello?

3517
02:14:48,150 --> 02:14:49,050
Jeff Bezos!

3518
02:14:49,230 --> 02:14:49,790
I wanna...

3519
02:14:49,790 --> 02:14:49,970
Okay.

3520
02:14:50,150 --> 02:14:50,590
Wait.

3521
02:14:50,910 --> 02:14:51,590
Alright, Mickey.

3522
02:14:51,730 --> 02:14:54,210
I want to take a picture with you, Mickey.

3523
02:14:54,890 --> 02:14:55,670
This time.

3524
02:14:57,930 --> 02:14:59,410
Mickey, why did you walk away?

3525
02:14:59,890 --> 02:15:00,710
Mickey, why...

3526
02:15:00,710 --> 02:15:01,230
Mickey, stop!

3527
02:15:01,510 --> 02:15:02,170
Stop, Mickey!

3528
02:15:02,410 --> 02:15:02,670
Okay.

3529
02:15:02,710 --> 02:15:03,350
What if like...

3530
02:15:03,350 --> 02:15:03,710
Here.

3531
02:15:03,890 --> 02:15:05,030
I need you to...

3532
02:15:05,030 --> 02:15:05,970
There we go.

3533
02:15:06,070 --> 02:15:06,850
There we go.

3534
02:15:07,930 --> 02:15:08,410
Oh.

3535
02:15:08,530 --> 02:15:09,010
Nope.

3536
02:15:12,050 --> 02:15:12,870
There we go.

3537
02:15:12,890 --> 02:15:13,850
Me and my friend Mickey!

3538
02:15:14,650 --> 02:15:15,270
Let's go!

3539
02:15:15,690 --> 02:15:15,850
Oh!

3540
02:15:16,490 --> 02:15:17,050
Okay.

3541
02:15:17,730 --> 02:15:18,290
Yeah.

3542
02:15:18,970 --> 02:15:19,530
Wait.

3543
02:15:20,230 --> 02:15:20,970
Let's see.

3544
02:15:21,290 --> 02:15:21,850
This.

3545
02:15:22,990 --> 02:15:23,550
Yeah.

3546
02:15:23,610 --> 02:15:24,830
And then...

3547
02:15:25,610 --> 02:15:26,170
What...

3548
02:15:27,090 --> 02:15:28,050
What expression?

3549
02:15:33,810 --> 02:15:34,370
Alright.

3550
02:15:34,550 --> 02:15:35,070
Let's see.

3551
02:15:35,350 --> 02:15:36,590
Oh, I have to like...

3552
02:15:36,590 --> 02:15:36,790
Okay.

3553
02:15:39,370 --> 02:15:41,930
This night Disney at Dreamlight Valley.

3554
02:15:42,090 --> 02:15:42,790
There we go.

3555
02:15:43,210 --> 02:15:43,770
Alright.

3556
02:15:45,410 --> 02:15:45,490
Okay.

3557
02:15:45,490 --> 02:15:45,770
Uh...

3558
02:15:45,770 --> 02:15:46,850
Capture.

3559
02:15:47,910 --> 02:15:48,510
Hide.

3560
02:15:48,750 --> 02:15:49,370
Alright, guys.

3561
02:15:52,050 --> 02:15:52,650
Wait.

3562
02:16:02,560 --> 02:16:05,700
Me and the best...

3563
02:16:08,060 --> 02:16:08,660
Alright.

3564
02:16:14,440 --> 02:16:15,040
Alright.

3565
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:18,420
That seems like a good time to call it today.

3566
02:16:19,280 --> 02:16:20,140
We're gonna go to the next one.

3567
02:16:20,160 --> 02:16:20,780
We're in the Coopee...

3568
02:16:20,780 --> 02:16:21,160
Coopee.

3569
02:16:21,360 --> 02:16:21,840
Coopee!

3570
02:16:22,760 --> 02:16:23,240
Coopee!

3571
02:16:23,240 --> 02:16:24,200
Hey, everybody!

3572
02:16:25,000 --> 02:16:28,040
I was a wild start of the day!

3573
02:16:28,140 --> 02:16:28,720
I'm gonna take my...

3574
02:16:28,720 --> 02:16:29,140
I'm gonna...

3575
02:16:29,140 --> 02:16:29,540
Um...

3576
02:16:29,540 --> 02:16:30,320
I'm gonna push the stream.

3577
02:16:30,460 --> 02:16:31,500
God of War stream back.

3578
02:16:31,960 --> 02:16:32,440
Ma...

3579
02:16:32,440 --> 02:16:35,440
I'll let you guys know if I'm gonna push the God of War stream back.

3580
02:16:35,620 --> 02:16:36,420
Maybe an hour.

3581
02:16:36,640 --> 02:16:38,820
Because I'm gonna head straight to the PC store now.

3582
02:16:39,140 --> 02:16:39,520
But!

3583
02:16:39,520 --> 02:16:41,160
But I had a great time everybody!

3584
02:16:41,760 --> 02:16:49,100
As always everyone, stay hydrated, posture check, get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

3585
02:16:49,380 --> 02:16:51,940
And if you stay up for me, head to bed.

3586
02:16:52,160 --> 02:16:53,560
Because you deserve it!

3587
02:16:53,800 --> 02:16:55,300
I'll see you guys next time everybody!

3588
02:16:55,980 --> 02:16:56,800
Bye guys!

3589
02:16:57,540 --> 02:16:58,060
Bye!
