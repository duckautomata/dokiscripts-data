1
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:49,110
Alright, we're live.

2
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:52,290
We're live now.

3
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:53,910
My YouTube, Doki Bird.

4
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:57,030
Yeah, is... yeah.

5
00:01:57,530 --> 00:01:59,850
Yeah, I think that's how YouTube... I don't know.

6
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:06,450
You look up Doki Bird, that's where I am.

7
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:10,290
Not a kid's channel.

8
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:11,630
Not a kid's channel.

9
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:16,530
I just hope I don't get flagged as a kid's channel.

10
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:18,430
Wait, wait, wait, wait, okay.

11
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:20,670
Don't change my game to Roblox.

12
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:23,050
This is not a kid's channel.

13
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:24,510
Children leave.

14
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:27,530
You're not welcome here, you fucks.

15
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:31,650
My Roblox account got banned.

16
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:34,450
Wait, your Roblox account got... what did you do?

17
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:42,350
My main Roblox account, I tried to log in to add you and it told me that my main Roblox account got banned for a bad username.

18
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:46,250
Wait, when was the last time you used Roblox?

19
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:47,370
I don't even know.

20
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:49,490
It told me March 20th.

21
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:51,270
So like a week ago they banned me.

22
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:51,530
I don't...

23
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:53,290
What did you do a week ago?

24
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:59,910
I don't know how they fucking like sniffed me out, but they told me I couldn't have the name ass.

25
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:06,750
Okay, to be fair, how did you get away with ass?

26
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:11,390
You can't even say like... you can't even say like woman in Roblox without...

27
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:11,690
You can't say women?

28
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:16,310
Wait, okay, can you say woman with an E or woman with an A?

29
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:17,370
Not an E?

30
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:18,130
You can't say either.

31
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:22,770
You can't say... women don't ex... you're right, women don't even exist in video games, you're right.

32
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:23,490
They're so true.

33
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:25,030
So true, Roblox.

34
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:26,590
What?

35
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:27,950
What?

36
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:28,550
What?

37
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:33,830
Guys, you know that women aren't real in video games.

38
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:34,230
Oh my god.

39
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:37,030
Women literally aren't even in video games.

40
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:37,570
Yeah.

41
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:39,870
They're not... they're not real.

42
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:41,510
Women aren't real.

43
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:42,550
I got the censor block.

44
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:46,850
Behind every Vtuber is a man.

45
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:48,730
It's true.

46
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:49,890
With a voice changer.

47
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:51,430
They were right.

48
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:52,690
They were always right.

49
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:54,150
They were always right.

50
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:56,510
Everybody who appears at cons, yeah, those are hired.

51
00:03:57,490 --> 00:03:59,650
Hired women who pretend to know.

52
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:06,310
Hired women who pretend to know about video games and Vtubers.

53
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:11,230
Yeah, you want to catch one and just walk up to them and be like okay, so you're a girl, huh?

54
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:12,070
You're a paid actor.

55
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:12,750
A paid actor.

56
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:13,730
Yeah, paid actor.

57
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:14,910
A paid actor.

58
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:15,530
Yeah, yeah.

59
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:16,350
You...

60
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:16,490
Yeah.

61
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:16,830
You're a character.

62
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:17,310
You're a character.

63
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:17,350
You're a character.

64
00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:23,950
What's your favorite Pokemon game in the Pokemon series?

65
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:27,250
Name three starters from Pokemon Diamond and Pearl.

66
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:33,590
In your opinion, what was the most based Pokemon protagonist?

67
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:39,470
In your opinion, would you smash your past, Guard of War?

68
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:44,150
Only women can answer this question.

69
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:48,770
Only women can really discern the popularity difference between a Lopunny and a Guard of War.

70
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:57,470
What is the... what is... which Pokemon has the egg type to...

71
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:05,070
Which Pokemon is sexually compatible based on egg type?

72
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:11,330
And if they can't even answer that, they're not real women.

73
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:14,630
Your maternal instincts should give you the answer already.

74
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:15,150
Oh!

75
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:17,790
So true.

76
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:23,490
Only a real... real man behind a VTuber can guess.

77
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:25,010
God, we've just started.

78
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:25,750
Ten minutes.

79
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:28,010
We've gone so far.

80
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:35,730
Oh, oh, oh, Doki, did you... did you learn to do the... the... the collab thing where you're like both on the screen together?

81
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:37,090
I don't know, have you done that one?

82
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:38,790
I've done that before, yeah.

83
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:39,370
Mm-hmm.

84
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:39,810
Yeah.

85
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:41,710
I always like to do that, but I don't know...

86
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:42,930
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we can do that.

87
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:45,170
You can set it up, because I'm lazy.

88
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:45,650
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

89
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:48,650
I'm like, okay, I think I just need to add you on Steam if that's okay.

90
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:50,450
Oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, let me grab my code.

91
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:51,550
It's okay, guys.

92
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:52,430
We're...

93
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:52,870
In your digits.

94
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:57,270
Now you guys can listen to us set up this so much more professional...

95
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:00,950
You got... you got Roblox installed already, right?

96
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:04,990
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I got the... wait, we had to install Rob... what?

97
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:10,010
Okay, well, it's like... it's like a browse... it's like a launcher.

98
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:13,930
So basically when you click play, it's just... it'll like boot up a window.

99
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:14,650
Oh!

100
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:18,610
It's not really like a program, but you do kind of have to do like a little bit of a download.

101
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:19,990
Okay, yeah, that's fine.

102
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:20,550
I have fiber.

103
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:21,430
We should be good.

104
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:22,310
I have fiber.

105
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:22,670
Oh, nice.

106
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:24,350
She got those optic cables.

107
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:28,710
Yeah, I was like... I was like, you have to download... I thought it was a browser game.

108
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:29,810
What?

109
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:35,830
I think it used to be, but they have... they definitely have their own little like program now.

110
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:37,330
Okay, let me... let me add y'all.

111
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:44,110
I think like the saddest thing I've ever heard about Roblox was when they got rid of the oof sound, because it got copyrighted.

112
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:46,290
I forgot that that happened.

113
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:47,350
That's so sad.

114
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:50,470
That's when Roblox fell off.

115
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:51,390
That's when...

116
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:55,250
That's when Roblox went downhill.

117
00:06:56,030 --> 00:07:01,710
I live in the constant like realization that like all games these days just mimic Roblox.

118
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:04,550
Like all these games, I'm like, this is just Roblox.

119
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:05,110
Like Fortnite.

120
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:05,790
Wait, really?

121
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:06,330
Like what?

122
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:07,150
That's simply Roblox.

123
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:09,110
Like, like, you know that new one that's come out?

124
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:10,790
Like Content Warning or like...

125
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:11,270
Oh yeah!

126
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:12,110
Content Warning!

127
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:13,450
I wanted to try it out.

128
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:14,070
I haven't played it yet.

129
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:15,230
Oh we should play it sometime.

130
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:16,150
I haven't played it.

131
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:16,650
Yeah, yeah, yeah me too.

132
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:17,270
I really want...

133
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:25,450
My friend linked me to... One of my friends linked me to one of the Content Warning videos where...

134
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:29,790
Where... Oh, no, they deleted the link!

135
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:30,610
Oh no they didn't!

136
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:34,830
Where it was like they were... It was... How do I explain it?

137
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:36,030
Ashley, it's nothing you explain.

138
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:37,010
I'm going to link it to you.

139
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:38,550
What does this look like to you?

140
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:39,490
And...

141
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:41,170
What does this look like?

142
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:46,300
What is that?

143
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,280
Can you explain?

144
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,140
He's the only thing about the class.

145
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:49,320
Oh dear lord!

146
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:52,900
Can you explain to the class what I sent you?

147
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:58,050
Holy matrimony!

148
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,540
This is what I'm about to do to you guys' wives.

149
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:05,360
Oh my god!

150
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:14,060
I disappeared because my Steam was like, we have to restart your Steam.

151
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:15,320
Goodbye everybody!

152
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,400
I'm gone from the screen.

153
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:21,700
Alright guys, look.

154
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:29,720
Thank god I am playing a game that's totally not for children because what I'm gonna link in chat is not appropriate.

155
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:39,780
Just so you guys know, what I'm about to link to the chat is hella inappropriate.

156
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,020
It's simply how the children are made.

157
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:46,820
So I hope there actually is no kids.

158
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,960
Cause I'd get in that.

159
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:54,920
Especially when I'm playing Roblox!

160
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,460
Anyway, this is what I sent Snuffy.

161
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:01,440
Enjoy!

162
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:06,040
I'm gonna be using this one for a while.

163
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:06,620
Woah!

164
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,300
Well yes.

165
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:12,480
Aren't you guys excited for content warning the game?

166
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:16,980
I don't know anything about it so this is just even more like how did we get here?

167
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:22,740
Apparently it's like lethal company but like what if you're doing it all for content?

168
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,340
Like it's...

169
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:25,180
That's what it was!

170
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:25,820
Yeah!

171
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:28,660
It was made to be a streaming game.

172
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:34,240
It's literally lethal company but like you film sh- it's like let's do it for the vine, you know?

173
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:35,040
That type of shit.

174
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:37,980
Yeah, do it for the vine!

175
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:40,380
Yeah, do it for the vine, the video game.

176
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:40,900
Exactly.

177
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,500
Watch your friends jump and be like, yeah!

178
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:43,560
Woohoo!

179
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:45,400
And you can die!

180
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,820
Apparently you can die too because you know.

181
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,640
You're doing it for the vine!

182
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:54,260
Alright, what do I- how do I join you?

183
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,840
Oh yeah, did you add me?

184
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I added you.

185
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,160
Okay...

186
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,040
Am I not popping up on the screen?

187
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:02,700
Oh there I am.

188
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:08,160
Wait a minute, okay, welcome to the- so okay, so blah blah blah, do you use- you use spout capture?

189
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,460
Uh, I used... what?

190
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,280
Spout?

191
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:17,100
Sorry!

192
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:25,040
When you do OBS streaming with VTube Studio, do you use spout capture or do you just use like a game capture?

193
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:26,340
Game capture, yeah.

194
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:27,760
I was like, what the fuck is spout?

195
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,820
Maybe hide your model so you don't like show any information then.

196
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:32,480
Okay, okay.

197
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:37,140
So like if you click your little side button, like the items in the background, does that appear on your stream and stuff?

198
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:37,740
The little buttons?

199
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:38,940
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I hit it.

200
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:41,160
Guys, I'm gonna be gone for a little bit, give me a sec.

201
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:42,600
Give me a sec.

202
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:44,980
You should check that out.

203
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:45,380
Spout capture.

204
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:46,440
Spout capture is fucking amazing.

205
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:50,780
Like literally, it hides all the UI for VTube Studio and it runs way better.

206
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:52,400
I 100% recommend it.

207
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:56,100
Okay, I'm gonna write that- I'm gonna rewatch this bot because I'm not gonna write this down.

208
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:57,000
Okay.

209
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:58,140
Timestampers!

210
00:10:58,220 --> 00:10:58,960
I gotta set a password.

211
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:07,500
Timestampers, if you're gonna post my timestamps in my YouTube comments, remember to write this one down and put it in all caps and bold it if you can.

212
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:11,160
Just so I can remember to watch this part.

213
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:14,280
Okay.

214
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:18,460
Okay, so it should be... wait, what did I make the password?

215
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:23,820
I'm gonna add you to something and then you just have to put in the password and I think that's...

216
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:24,340
Alright, nice.

217
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,280
Password is empty.

218
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:37,820
Also, like, one of my dragoons was like, my favorite description of Content Warning is basically, Lethal Company, but you are Jake Paul.

219
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,100
Oh, gosh.

220
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,780
Oh, gosh.

221
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,860
I heard he's like, boxing some- wait.

222
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:49,320
I forgot the other one.

223
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,260
The other one?

224
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:53,800
Okay, sorry, like- There's two of them, right?

225
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:54,300
Yeah, yeah.

226
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,360
I like how even you're like, wait, was there two of them?

227
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,140
There might be more!

228
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:02,100
How many Pauls are there?

229
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:03,960
Was it two?

230
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:04,200
Jake?

231
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:04,700
John?

232
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:07,320
I'm just naming, like, the Beatles at this point.

233
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:11,660
Paul?

234
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:17,380
Okay, to be fair, they all like, they both lured together for me because they both like, do the same thing now.

235
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:25,040
One- except for one owning- one owns an energy drink and is like, spon- like, is sponsoring a fucking basketball team now.

236
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:25,360
Prime or whatever.

237
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:26,400
Yeah, yeah, Prime.

238
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,160
I got Prime.

239
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,020
Have you ever tried it?

240
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:30,320
No.

241
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:35,820
Have you ever tried any of the, like, content creator- like, did you ever try the pink whatever or the pink juice or something?

242
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:36,180
The pink?

243
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:36,620
Pink sauce?

244
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:37,120
Dude, was that pink?

245
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,240
Oh, the pink sauce!

246
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,120
That wasn't content creator.

247
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,500
That was just some...

248
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:41,140
Oh.

249
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:43,700
Some- some fucking- Like, a famous person or something?

250
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:47,460
No, it was just some TikToker who tried to mail, like, sauce.

251
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,680
Like, you never heard of it?

252
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,080
What do you mean?

253
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:58,360
Like, like, okay, it was just some TikToker who got viral because she made, like, you know, pink sauce.

254
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:04,020
And then she was, like, mailing, like, the sauce in, like, just a fucking envelope to people.

255
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,220
Like, there was no cooling or anything.

256
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:10,480
She just mailed a fucking bottle of sauce to people.

257
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,860
Yeah, she just mailed it to random- to, like, random people.

258
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:18,280
So, like, the sauce was, like, dripping out or exploded and it was like- Wait, no, because I've seen it- I've seen it at, like, Target.

259
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:22,900
Yeah, yeah, and then, like, some fucking sauce company bought- bought the brand.

260
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:25,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

261
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:26,600
Yeah, they're like, wait.

262
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,880
I'm John Sauce and I need this on my shelf.

263
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:29,540
Wait a minute.

264
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:32,340
We- the pink sauce.

265
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,240
That's- that's what we need.

266
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:39,520
The booth says it just needed to be pink.

267
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:43,560
Next, they're gonna make the sauce blue so they can make his and her sauce.

268
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:48,460
So- And then- and then the her sauce is like- Gender reveal sauce.

269
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:53,460
Yeah, yeah, and then the her sauce is, like, five dollars more expensive even- because it's pink.

270
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:55,620
I'm talking about the pink tag.

271
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:56,620
Yeah, yeah.

272
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:59,620
I like the gender- gender reveal, like, barbecue party.

273
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:00,120
Yeah, yeah.

274
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,080
What gender is your kid?

275
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:05,980
Grab your his and her sauce today.

276
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:07,280
Hey.

277
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:12,860
I'm talking about my wedding and- and please make sure that the his and her sauce is there.

278
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:13,320
Yeah, yeah.

279
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:13,920
My dream wedding.

280
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:14,360
Please.

281
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:20,940
I need to be sure that the women use the pink sauce and the men use the blue sauce.

282
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:22,500
What do you mean there's no his and her ketchup anymore?

283
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,080
I use the Shrek ketchup.

284
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,600
She uses the purple ketchup.

285
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:30,740
I don't remember what- What is purple ketchup?

286
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,220
But I forget, like, what- We're quirky.

287
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:32,800
What the media was.

288
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,920
We don't- we don't- we're quirky.

289
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:37,920
We use the Shrek and- the Shrek and purple sauce.

290
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:39,500
What is the purple ketchup?

291
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,320
There was a purple- there was a purple ketchup, right?

292
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:41,740
There was a purple ketchup?

293
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:42,300
Purple ketchup?

294
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:43,660
I know about the green ketchup.

295
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:44,100
I think there was.

296
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,460
It was the easy squirt.

297
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:46,940
Heinz easy squirt.

298
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:47,400
Oh.

299
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:48,620
Wait, I'm gonna send you the picture of it.

300
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:48,840
What a great name.

301
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,520
I feel like it'll hit you like a rock.

302
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,200
Like, look at this.

303
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:52,620
What an amazing name.

304
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:53,720
Oh!

305
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:55,960
That looks disgusting!

306
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:59,120
That actually looks disgusting.

307
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:02,500
They make green and purple but not pink and blue.

308
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:03,960
It's literally right there.

309
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:08,660
Yeah, those are like the more, like, muddied colors of just, like, chaos.

310
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:09,480
Like, I don't know.

311
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:09,940
Like, what?

312
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:14,140
Oh, so guys, I'm gonna disappear again because Snuffy sent me the thingy.

313
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,600
But, like, what?

314
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:21,520
Who thought green and purple was, like, the colors to do when pink and blue was right there?

315
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:26,220
Like, why did they- What, you think pink and blue is more appetizing?

316
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,680
Like, what is the tastiest color?

317
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,140
Okay, and green is- okay, and green is much better.

318
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:34,580
You try to say green is- Green is like vegetables and stuff, you know?

319
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:38,500
No, you don't- Like, you don't want to have green sauce.

320
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,460
Like, what?

321
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:41,620
That's a fair name.

322
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,140
Delicious tomatillo.

323
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:48,140
Oh my god, they let some random TikToker get ahead of them.

324
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:54,080
I literally- how come you guys never invented food coloring before?

325
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:54,780
I know.

326
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:56,060
I need- I need- oh, man.

327
00:15:56,220 --> 00:16:00,000
Would you drink from the, like, the cursed orange dye Garfield cup?

328
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:00,120
The Boolean?

329
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,840
The radioactive Garfield cup?

330
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:03,820
The ra- yes, because it's Garfield.

331
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:08,840
I mean, like, okay, it's just a little- as long as I don't build it up, you know?

332
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:13,460
As long as I don't- Don't- don't do it continuously.

333
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:15,300
It should be fine, right?

334
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,100
Do it contin- Yeah.

335
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:17,680
I don't know.

336
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,580
Like, as- you know, you- you have one.

337
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:26,640
You can, like, expose yourself to radiation, like, once or some- It's- it's like a freebie?

338
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:28,160
Yeah, like a freebie.

339
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,800
Like, a scratch off, like, one free radioactive explosion.

340
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:31,320
Yes, exactly.

341
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:32,320
What?

342
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:32,720
Yes.

343
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:33,420
Yes!

344
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:37,520
As long- okay, it's like a- it's like a- a Bestos, you know?

345
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:40,860
Like- Bestos?

346
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:45,700
Yeah, like, you know, when you're exposed to Bestos, you get- you know, you get cancer?

347
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:46,740
You get lung cancer?

348
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:47,220
But!

349
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:51,740
If you- you- if you don't continuously expose yourself, you'll be fine.

350
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:56,140
You just, you know, go into, like, the house, like, for, like, five seconds, you'll be okay.

351
00:16:58,580 --> 00:16:59,820
Is that how it works?

352
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,600
You're gonna fucking die.

353
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:03,220
Is that how it works?

354
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:04,560
I'm so worried.

355
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:07,600
It's like- it's like, as long as you don't breathe in all of it.

356
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:16,040
If you breathe it in, God himself descends upon you and he's like, that's okay too.

357
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,240
Look, bananas have radiation!

358
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:20,220
It proves my theory!

359
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:21,240
What?

360
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:23,300
Bananas have radiation in them!

361
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:26,040
That's not radiation, that's calcium!

362
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:28,560
No, no, no, you didn't know that?

363
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:30,380
Bananas have a little bit of radiation.

364
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:31,000
No, calcium.

365
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,180
Wait, what?

366
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,800
Okay, now you're coping.

367
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,840
Now you're- Hey, what?

368
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:41,280
There's no, like, I get California notifications saying that everything I eat has lead in it.

369
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:43,700
Why would they not tell me if bananas have fucking radiation?

370
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:47,660
It's just a little bit.

371
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:48,700
That's what I'm saying!

372
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:53,240
As long as it's just a little bit of radiation, it's fine.

373
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:55,680
A little bit of radiation as a treat.

374
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:59,340
Yeah, it's just a little, you know, a little treat.

375
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:00,240
See?

376
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,100
So it's like, it's so tiny.

377
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,760
The drought is so fucking tiny.

378
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:10,320
But if you eat like a hundred thousand bananas, maybe it's not- maybe then it gets a bit worse!

379
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:13,200
Maybe it's a thousand bananas and then you'll die of rain.

380
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:21,140
You know, it's like- Also, how does fucking- I don't cat connect to this fucking- Wait, okay.

381
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:23,420
Let me, let me, let me, let me walk you through it.

382
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:27,800
So you click the bottom button, you click the little group of dudes, the three little men saying the same thing.

383
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:28,580
Yeah, yeah, I joined you.

384
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,980
Yeah, join me.

385
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:33,380
You type in the password and the name so you see, like, I have the password.

386
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:33,740
Yeah.

387
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:36,140
And then there's the person name.

388
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:36,560
Yeah.

389
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:37,320
What does it say?

390
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:39,660
It says- Is it loading or something?

391
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:46,320
It just says like- it just puts me in the connecting forever and I have like- Oh, oh my god, I had to like start it.

392
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:46,780
Oh!

393
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:48,000
Oh my god.

394
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:55,020
I know you wanted to talk about radiated foods, but...

395
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:57,840
My brain is fried.

396
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:03,720
I was gonna say, isn't it funny if you- if with that logic you could like sprinkle a little bit of radiation on each of your foods?

397
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:04,540
It's like a treat.

398
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:08,140
Okay, but like the thing is- It would have helped me 100,000 bananas.

399
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,200
I said you get one.

400
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:11,240
Now you're trying.

401
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:19,520
Well, imagine if you separate it and you make it into a fraction so one banana, you could still have like a fraction of that banana.

402
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,520
Yeah, yeah, for bananas.

403
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:21,240
Yeah.

404
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:25,780
I feel like you'll die by the time you get radiation from bananas.

405
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:27,520
I think- I think it's fine.

406
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,720
Like, you- Oh, I thought you meant you were gonna die from the radiation.

407
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,200
No, no, no.

408
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:36,080
There's no way- You buy before- You buy bananas in your lifetime to get radiation poisoning.

409
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:42,980
That's why- that's why I'm saying if there was a Garfield cup like that's filled with radiation, I get one.

410
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:48,280
As long as I don't- as long as I don't pass the threshold to get radiation, we're fine.

411
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:52,800
It was enough radiation to make sure it was like never sold again though.

412
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,500
Like, I think maybe it was a lot.

413
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:59,660
Okay, but- but that happened like a long time ago.

414
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,740
Did anyone die from the Garfield cup?

415
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:02,600
No.

416
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:03,760
So we're fine.

417
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:08,800
If the people back then didn't die from the Garfield cup, I would be okay.

418
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:14,340
Also, like, did you start the thing?

419
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:17,060
Cause I still can't get- I think it's loading.

420
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:20,020
Oh, it's an invalid password.

421
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:21,040
What?

422
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:24,840
Wait, so I didn't fuck it up.

423
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,540
You fucked it up.

424
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,420
Are you- did you put the password in correctly?

425
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:30,520
No, I did.

426
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:31,900
I- what do you mean?

427
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:35,700
Okay, let me- let me- let me try again.

428
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:38,160
Guys, we're professional streamers.

429
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:42,060
Snuffy has been streaming... maybe even longer than me.

430
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:46,840
My stream anniversary is on 420.

431
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:48,700
I'll be streaming for four years.

432
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:49,480
Oh dear.

433
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:50,480
I'm old.

434
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:55,620
Snuffy has been using this app definitely longer than me.

435
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:57,660
Okay, okay.

436
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,620
Try now.

437
00:20:58,900 --> 00:20:59,840
See if that works.

438
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:01,860
Please, please.

439
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:02,820
Is everything correct?

440
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,140
No, it says I got disconnected.

441
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,760
Wrong password.

442
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,720
Okay, I- am I getting- What?

443
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:11,360
Are you- are you using the right password?

444
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:16,040
I- I think- Wait, there's no password in there.

445
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:17,580
Oh, wait.

446
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,180
I didn't put the password in.

447
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:24,360
You- I didn't put the password in!

448
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:27,400
I'm gonna force you to drink five cups of Garfield cup today.

449
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:31,360
Guys, I didn't- I didn't realize I had to insert a password, guys.

450
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,180
I'm connecting.

451
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:32,820
I'm in.

452
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:35,420
You just put the right password in and you're like, simply I put it in right.

453
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:37,780
And you didn't even know I put in the password!

454
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:42,120
I just put the name, you know, the- the Doki Snuffy.

455
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:43,940
Can't be wrong if I never inserted that password.

456
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:44,880
Yeah, exactly.

457
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,960
Can't be wrong if I never put in that password, guys.

458
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:54,760
Oh my- I'm glad, like, we're on the same wavelength here.

459
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:56,300
It's not my fault.

460
00:21:57,140 --> 00:22:02,200
No, it's- it's just flip-flop between, like, who fucked- Oh my god, Joki jumpscare!

461
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:03,740
Wait, where are you?

462
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,520
Oh shit, there you are!

463
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:06,620
Okay.

464
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:07,660
Okay.

465
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:08,400
Okay, wait, how do I do this?

466
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:12,560
Start- How do I- Ruffjohn, bring your bottle from the- Okay, so if you left click, you'll be in front.

467
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,920
Yeah, right- if you right click, you won't be in front.

468
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:16,260
So I can, like, maybe- Okay.

469
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:17,720
Alright, here we go.

470
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:18,720
We're figuring this out.

471
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:21,300
We're figuring- Okay.

472
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,600
Wait, I should be taller.

473
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:25,380
Oh yeah?

474
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:27,620
How can- canonically, are you tall?

475
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,500
Are you a tall one?

476
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:29,460
I'm, like, eight feet tall.

477
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,380
Wait, wait, wait!

478
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:34,020
Okay.

479
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:35,960
Oh wow, Joki, hi!

480
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:40,900
Alright, alright, yeah, yeah, this is- this is canon hype, by the way, guys.

481
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:41,480
Just-

482
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:45,880
Holy shit!

483
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:50,540
Wait, that means you're, like, seven feet- you're not seven feet, you're smaller.

484
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:54,320
Oh my god, I'm literally- There, there, that feels right.

485
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:54,600
Am I?

486
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:55,260
Yeah.

487
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:57,960
I'm not on my screen anymore.

488
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:05,520
That's right, this is my stream now.

489
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:06,440
Oh god.

490
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:13,080
Okay, here we go.

491
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:14,900
We're doing this.

492
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:22,660
It only took us a while, but we figured- guys, we're only 25 minutes- actually, no, we're only 30 minutes late, guys.

493
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:23,300
It's okay.

494
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:25,840
I think it's been- I think it's been great.

495
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,060
This is a mid-40.

496
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,500
Yeah, it's- this is fine, guys.

497
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:30,480
We're only 30 minutes late.

498
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:32,460
But look at the content.

499
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,880
Now you know about radiation and bananas.

500
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:36,460
Yeah, nice.

501
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,300
Watch your banana intake, guys.

502
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:39,220
Yeah, yeah.

503
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:43,000
And to all you kids out there who's watching me, get the fuck out.

504
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,640
Yeah, and your banana intake as well, kids.

505
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:48,040
Yeah.

506
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:49,200
It's not a joke, it's serious.

507
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:52,380
Yeah, eat as many bananas as you want, you won't get radiation poisoning.

508
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:54,560
If you see Garfield on a cup, just walk away.

509
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,700
No, just take one sip and you'll be fine, you get one.

510
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,540
Take one and drink.

511
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,260
We all get one, you know?

512
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:03,560
We all get to pick our radiation.

513
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:06,220
Would that be like your final?

514
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:09,400
Like if you were on like death row and they're like, you get one last meal.

515
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,140
I want the Garfield.

516
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:12,240
Pour me a fresh cup.

517
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:14,700
Give me that Garfield cup.

518
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:19,140
I want all the food blended into the Garfield.

519
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,040
I wanna know what radiation tastes like.

520
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:27,420
I wanna know the Garfield in red 40.

521
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:27,660
Okay.

522
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,340
You didn't- you know that like-.

523
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:35,900
The reason why Garfield- the Garfield cup was filled with radiation was because of the color orange.

524
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:42,060
Yeah, yeah, cause it was like a- I don't know which combination- poisonous color of orange?

525
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:48,460
It was like orange and green are like- you need like radiation to make- to make orange and green back then.

526
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:51,400
Cause that happened for Star Wars too.

527
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:57,120
Where like they had to recall a bunch of Star Wars cup because it had like orange and green in it.

528
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:03,420
Oh, what- we- Like- oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, C-3PO.

529
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,180
Was it like a C-3PO cup?

530
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,020
I have no idea.

531
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:10,300
I just remember- I just remember they had to recall a bunch of Star Wars cup.

532
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:11,040
Cadmium.

533
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:11,920
They're forbidden colors.

534
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,600
I think it's like cadmium.

535
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:17,080
I'm on- I'm on a- I'm on Know Your Meme.

536
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:23,780
Hey, guys remember that funny meme when people and kids were getting exposed to radiation?

537
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,600
So fucking hilarious.

538
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:30,420
This picture says- 1978 Garfield.

539
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:32,820
It's not a pretty life, but somebody has to live it.

540
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:33,580
McDonald's mug.

541
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:42,560
99,000 ppm lead causes brain damage plus 5,830 ppm cadmium causes cancer.

542
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:44,740
So it actually wasn't even just cancer.

543
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:47,760
You also get brain damage if you drink Garfield cup.

544
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,780
Okay, but like how many- but like how much do you have to drink though?

545
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:51,500
Like what?

546
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:56,220
What's the limit before I get brain damage?

547
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:57,740
It's really close to cancer.

548
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:03,120
Like does one sip give you brain damage or was it like, you know, several cups?

549
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,460
Like we didn't know the numbers here.

550
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:10,260
I feel like we should just- we can- we can just have this like test for ourselves.

551
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:12,560
Like I'm surprised nobody's like- That's who you wanted to drink.

552
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:15,980
People wanted to drink the Garfield cup.

553
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:17,660
It's okay.

554
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:20,980
That sounds like- It's content.

555
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:23,340
Content for- Yeah, it's content.

556
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,680
Monday's in my right.

557
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:30,520
April Fools, happy Monday.

558
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:33,340
I'm gonna drink five glasses of Garfield cadmium.

559
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:43,200
You know like those like YouTube videos where they're like taste- they're like a tier list of which cup has the most radiation.

560
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:46,740
Radioactive glassware tier list.

561
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:47,800
That sounds incredible.

562
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,260
That's actually incredible.

563
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,060
It did.

564
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:55,180
Tier list radioactive glassware.

565
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:57,120
It does the most radiation.

566
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:01,320
Come and find out as we taste each radiated cup.

567
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:06,240
I'm like swirling it around like we're trying wine like, oh yeah, this one really resonates with me.

568
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,640
Yeah, I can taste the lid already.

569
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:12,580
I can feel my brain like fuzzing up.

570
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:20,140
And then like somebody get the- those fucking like radiation testing machines and then like beep beep beep beep.

571
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,060
The Geiger counter.

572
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:22,820
Yeah, the Geiger counter.

573
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:24,840
They're like, alright, gotcha.

574
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:28,760
Let's see how much radiation this cup has.

575
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:30,300
Beep beep beep beep beep beep.

576
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:35,440
Even if it's like Fallout, we gotta have like the Fallout like rad noise of just like .

577
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,820
Even if it's like a wood pipe.

578
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:41,380
Like, oh my god.

579
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:44,560
I can feel the lead already eroding my lungs.

580
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:46,840
I think that's like an S tier right there.

581
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:48,240
What you think, Snuffy?

582
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,800
Do you think the lead tastes like it does?

583
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:53,040
Like, did you ever eat like pencil lead?

584
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:53,800
No, what?

585
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:53,840
What?

586
00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:00,730
Excuse me?

587
00:28:01,610 --> 00:28:03,070
Look, I thought we were acting.

588
00:28:03,170 --> 00:28:04,230
Now I'm not too sure.

589
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,880
Is this- is this acting?

590
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:14,280
Is this- are we still- are we-

591
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:22,360
Could you- could you explain your story?

592
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:25,680
You- you never- you never- No, no.

593
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:27,460
Judging by my reaction, absolutely.

594
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:30,120
Judging by my reaction, what do you think?

595
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:35,880
I- I thought maybe it was a formative experience for many people.

596
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:44,800
You know, when you're said school and you're bored, maybe your pencil broke and you're like, oh, the lead is just- it fell out.

597
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:52,540
You know, it used to just like crack and I don't even remember what possessed me to do it, but I feel like I was like, well, let me just- let me just eat it.

598
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:52,900
Sample.

599
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:56,740
I mean, it's like eating a Tic Tac.

600
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:58,540
It was like really simple.

601
00:28:58,540 --> 00:28:59,300
It was not salty.

602
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:02,960
It was like sour almost, like very chemically.

603
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:04,480
Oh my God.

604
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:08,080
People talk about glue eaters, but you're a fucking lead eater.

605
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:09,320
Sure.

606
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:14,500
Yeah, dude, I used to like lick it too.

607
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:19,300
After like I started eating it, I used to like- every time I used to start writing with a pencil, I would like lick it.

608
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,200
I would like suck.

609
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:25,260
I feel like you're- you would be like one of those students, my mom would be like, you shouldn't hang out with her.

610
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,140
I swear like I saw people in like movies.

611
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:33,940
They always like writers like lick their pen or something.

612
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:37,700
They like dab their pen, I think to like get the ink flowing, but I didn't understand what that meant.

613
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:40,080
So I would just start like doing that with like pencils.

614
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:43,520
So I would just like dab the pencil onto my- What?

615
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:49,920
I mean like, I- I- that's- but like you- you actively consume the graphite.

616
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:51,500
Don't you act- Yeah.

617
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:51,800
Yeah.

618
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:53,640
The wood do.

619
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,900
I just kind of started gnawing on all parts of it.

620
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,740
I think I got a little bit of the paint as well.

621
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:07,160
Chewing on- You know, I think you are the perfect person for the tier list.

622
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:08,940
Yeah, yeah.

623
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:12,620
We should just have like a toxic product tier list.

624
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:15,260
Where do you think we should put the- What was that?

625
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:18,420
The recalled products tier list.

626
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:21,600
The cursed consumer reports.

627
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,880
What's the best tasting recalled food?

628
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:27,240
Should they recall it?

629
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:27,720
I'm so in love.

630
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:36,260
I'm gonna be like- It'll be like- It'll be like- So, it will be like- By our judgment, yes, they definitely should have recalled it.

631
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:41,020
It can be one of them YouTube videos where it's like- No, you have to guess which one is which.

632
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:43,360
And we'll be like okay, this one is definitely the recalled.

633
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,860
I can taste- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

634
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:49,840
What- Five items are on the table.

635
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:51,880
Three have been recalled.

636
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:57,320
It is up to Snuffy and Doki to find out which three were recalled.

637
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:57,700
We'll pick one.

638
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,640
For containing leeeen.

639
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:05,440
You're like, I'm gonna get emails reaching out to me like, you know what, I think you'd be great for factory work.

640
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:07,620
Do you wanna like test some of our product going out?

641
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,140
Like you wanna be taste testing.

642
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:10,580
Like the product testing.

643
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:11,240
Quality insurance.

644
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,760
You get paid for that too!

645
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,940
I know, maybe I get benefits.

646
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:16,720
Thank god.

647
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,920
I like how we have yet to play Roblox.

648
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:27,760
Yeah, maybe there's cadmium tasting Roblox games.

649
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:33,220
Hey guys, you guys like this black screen?

650
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:37,660
Oh my god, we are distracted.

651
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:42,260
It all started with the Garfield Cup.

652
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,880
I don't even know how it started.

653
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:53,000
You know there's like, you can actually buy radiation items in like, like those like, what is it, those donation stores?

654
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:53,800
Like Goodwill?

655
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:54,180
What?

656
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:56,900
Like, is that what they're called in America?

657
00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:57,900
The Goodwill stores?

658
00:31:58,640 --> 00:31:59,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

659
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,940
Yeah, the second hand stores.

660
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,680
Cause like, there was a YouTube short.

661
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:05,880
I get all my information from YouTube shorts nowadays.

662
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:06,960
But like...

663
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:13,540
But like, there's this like, channel that gets like a Geiger County.

664
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:16,940
And they go to like, Goodwill.

665
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:21,880
And they like, find all the items that has like, uranium in there.

666
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,180
Dude, oh my god.

667
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:24,860
I actually...

668
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:27,700
Okay, so I actually probably have something that's good for this.

669
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:28,700
Because...

670
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:29,800
Good for...

671
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,580
Good for poisoning myself.

672
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:34,720
When I became like, independent, I was like, you know what?

673
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:37,800
A big thing about becoming an adult is, is like, owning plates.

674
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:38,260
Yeah.

675
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:40,560
So I went to like, a secondhand store to buy some plates.

676
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:42,900
And I was like, oh man, these ones are so cute.

677
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:44,140
And they're like, vintage.

678
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:44,920
That's so cool.

679
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:46,340
That should have been a warning sign.

680
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:48,260
My plates are from like, 1938.

681
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:49,900
Good.

682
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:52,200
Like, Googled it.

683
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:54,100
I was like, oh yeah, what kind of plates are these?

684
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:57,240
And it told me that like, they're at like, high risk.

685
00:32:57,340 --> 00:33:00,760
Like, anything 1950 or earlier is like, do not consume.

686
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,340
Because it's probably filled with lead.

687
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:04,260
You know.

688
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:06,260
So I've got like, tons of lead.

689
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:07,560
You have tons of...

690
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:08,040
Wait, have you...

691
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:09,940
Wait, you've actually consumed lead?

692
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:11,340
No, no.

693
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:14,980
Well, I mean, other than from the pencil, I'm then too afraid to use them.

694
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:17,040
I feel like I'll just have to serve it to my greatest enemy.

695
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,880
Oh, so they're just there for decoration type deal.

696
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,000
Yeah, yeah.

697
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:22,180
I bought like, a whole set.

698
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:24,520
And now I'm like, too nervous to ever eat from them.

699
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:27,960
But maybe I should like, eat your right in like, a little glass.

700
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:33,680
Okay, how many subs?

701
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:39,900
Oh my god, before the FTA was even fucking invented.

702
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,500
Holy shit, I'm gonna be good, dude.

703
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:43,880
I'm good, I'm great.

704
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:46,060
A British would suspend you if you had to.

705
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:49,860
I mean, I would consider that like, self harm.

706
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:54,360
Like that Twitch ban on a Twitter account.

707
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:56,040
Snuffbee has been banned.

708
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,460
Oh no.

709
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:01,140
That'd be way better than half of the bans though.

710
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:05,800
I'd be so proud if I got banned from drinking from a lead glass rather than like, showing ass.

711
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:10,660
I'd break the norm for VTubers in school.

712
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:16,240
No, I had the first VTuber to get banned for fucking drinking lead.

713
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,180
That's incredible honestly.

714
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:19,860
I'm so sorry.

715
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:21,740
I'm just blowing the track record for VTubers.

716
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:26,160
Oh man, there's a first for everything and I'm here to see it, dude.

717
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:33,760
Guys, just remember, if you think you have a plate that's really, really old, maybe don't use it.

718
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:39,840
Because most likely back then, they used lead or uranium to make the glass wet.

719
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,420
Is uranium the green one?

720
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:43,840
There's another green one, right?

721
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,220
Yeah, uranium's the green one.

722
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,020
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

723
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:46,920
Okay, okay.

724
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,380
Because I was wondering, that's the one where they...

725
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:49,860
Oh yeah, people go to the secondhand store.

726
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:51,180
And they have like the light, right?

727
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:51,940
Have you seen those?

728
00:34:52,140 --> 00:34:53,380
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

729
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:53,720
Yeah, yeah.

730
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,280
They shine the light and see if it...

731
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,940
I did that because they had a couple of them.

732
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:59,300
And I was like, I kind of want that.

733
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,680
I feel like that'd be fun.

734
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:04,240
You never know when Superman might show up and you got to like neutralize him.

735
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:07,500
Yeah, neutralize Superman.

736
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:08,860
Because of the weakness.

737
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:11,160
The green crystal.

738
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,280
The green...

739
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:13,740
The kryptonite?

740
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:15,960
You mean the kryptonite?

741
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:17,860
That's insane.

742
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:19,400
Bro, you're right.

743
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:19,840
That's insane.

744
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:21,140
I didn't do anything to Superman.

745
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:23,000
It's fucking kryptonite.

746
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:27,880
Look, they might both be green, but they're not the same thing.

747
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,880
I thought that was real.

748
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:36,200
His dog is named Krypto.

749
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:38,320
Why would you name your dog like your weakness?

750
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,980
Like, gone.

751
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:42,100
Like, imagine naming your cat like...

752
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:44,480
This is like the most badass thing ever.

753
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:47,560
Because it's like, this is the only thing that can hurt me.

754
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:48,280
Okay.

755
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:52,060
Oh my God.

756
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:53,460
I mean, I would name my dog Gun.

757
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:54,720
I think that's cool.

758
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:55,800
That's cool.

759
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:56,780
Where's my Gun?

760
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:58,020
That's what I was looking for.

761
00:35:58,020 --> 00:35:58,500
Gun, come here.

762
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:03,800
Spit, Gun.

763
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:10,840
Are they like naming also like people who name their pets after like, real people named?

764
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:14,060
Like, if you name your dog like Jerry or something.

765
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,120
That's an awful name for your dog.

766
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:18,260
You're an idiot.

767
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:22,500
Where's Jerry?

768
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:24,460
Where's Jerry?

769
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:27,840
It's something you're talking about like you don't know where your stepdad is.

770
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:30,480
Aw man, where'd Jerry go?

771
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:31,320
I miss that guy.

772
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:37,640
But it's like an eight year old fucking like beagle walking in and being like...

773
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:43,710
He's like, who's a good boy Jerry?

774
00:36:43,930 --> 00:36:46,750
You're my good boy Jerry, that's right.

775
00:36:50,530 --> 00:36:51,670
Oh my god.

776
00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:53,210
Roblox, right?

777
00:36:53,310 --> 00:36:53,970
Oh yeah, Roblox.

778
00:36:54,050 --> 00:36:56,890
Anyway, what's the first Roblox game you're gonna take me?

779
00:36:57,230 --> 00:37:01,910
Guys, I've only managed to play two Roblox games or maybe three.

780
00:37:02,030 --> 00:37:03,590
Oh yeah, I played Hospital RP.

781
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:08,330
Oh yeah, we lost a little... that's my favorite one.

782
00:37:08,370 --> 00:37:08,970
That's your favorite?

783
00:37:09,290 --> 00:37:15,190
I played Hospital RP, Doors, and the Warrior Cats roleplay.

784
00:37:15,510 --> 00:37:16,490
Okay, okay.

785
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:21,310
So like, Snuffy apparently is like a professional when it comes to Roblox.

786
00:37:21,470 --> 00:37:22,870
She has two accounts.

787
00:37:24,370 --> 00:37:31,090
I have my personal account for my formative experiences and then I have my work account for my business expenses.

788
00:37:31,350 --> 00:37:32,270
Business expenses.

789
00:37:32,510 --> 00:37:35,530
You go to your tax guy and you're like...

790
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:39,270
And I spent $50 here for Roblox.

791
00:37:39,270 --> 00:37:42,290
But it's a business expense because it was for stream.

792
00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:45,330
Yeah, that's how I felt about my gacha games.

793
00:37:45,470 --> 00:37:47,950
It's like my accountant would be like, okay, can I see your bank statements?

794
00:37:48,190 --> 00:37:52,750
And I'd just be like, listen, if you see $500 for Cookie Run Kingdom, then like, just close them.

795
00:37:53,110 --> 00:38:00,010
Just so you know, I streamed the content so it was a business expense.

796
00:38:00,670 --> 00:38:01,910
This was for stream.

797
00:38:01,930 --> 00:38:03,990
I was planning this for a sponsor.

798
00:38:04,830 --> 00:38:06,930
It was work related.

799
00:38:11,770 --> 00:38:12,390
I see.

800
00:38:12,470 --> 00:38:15,630
Okay, so most engaging on the list.

801
00:38:16,050 --> 00:38:19,010
So just let me know if you see a game that interests you at all.

802
00:38:19,050 --> 00:38:20,490
Because, you know, Roblox is pretty fun.

803
00:38:20,610 --> 00:38:24,490
I like it a lot for just being able to like hop in, hop out, be like, oh, you know, this was fun to try.

804
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:25,190
Let's try something else.

805
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:25,610
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

806
00:38:25,930 --> 00:38:28,530
If you see something that catches your interest, let me know.

807
00:38:29,450 --> 00:38:30,730
We've got some classics.

808
00:38:31,150 --> 00:38:33,570
Natural Disaster Survival is a great game.

809
00:38:33,650 --> 00:38:34,110
Super fun.

810
00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:36,070
But it's not cursed.

811
00:38:36,310 --> 00:38:36,910
What are you looking for?

812
00:38:36,910 --> 00:38:38,170
What's your interest?

813
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:38,550
Okay, you know what?

814
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:39,550
Surprise me.

815
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:41,070
Like, you're the expert here.

816
00:38:41,150 --> 00:38:43,790
You're supposed to take me to this, like, wild tour.

817
00:38:44,210 --> 00:38:47,470
Like, oh my gosh, you're like my pixie manic girl.

818
00:38:47,650 --> 00:38:49,670
And you're gonna take me to like the...

819
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:54,710
Your pixie manic girlfriend takes you to raise a Peter on Roblox.

820
00:38:54,810 --> 00:38:55,810
There you go.

821
00:38:57,950 --> 00:39:01,590
My life changed when I met my pixie manic girlfriend.

822
00:39:05,170 --> 00:39:05,950
Okay, okay.

823
00:39:05,990 --> 00:39:07,030
Bro, you have the hairstyle.

824
00:39:08,290 --> 00:39:13,150
You're the pixie manic guy from Berserk.

825
00:39:13,210 --> 00:39:14,470
That's what I can't stop hearing.

826
00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:16,410
Everybody's like, oh, nice Griffith hair, bro.

827
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:18,110
What the fuck is a Griffith?

828
00:39:18,170 --> 00:39:19,710
Bro, what the fuck is a Griffith?

829
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:21,310
What is a Griffith?

830
00:39:21,350 --> 00:39:27,010
The only thing I know about Berserk is the... is that scene.

831
00:39:27,950 --> 00:39:29,990
I should laugh about that scene.

832
00:39:30,190 --> 00:39:31,570
What scene?

833
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:33,130
The only thing I know about Berserk is that scene.

834
00:39:33,130 --> 00:39:34,190
Because it's so fucked up.

835
00:39:34,690 --> 00:39:35,990
It's that scene.

836
00:39:36,270 --> 00:39:41,630
Everyone, people who know about Berserk knows exactly what scene I'm talking about.

837
00:39:42,930 --> 00:39:46,370
I don't know anything about Berserk other than there's a guy named Griffith.

838
00:39:46,490 --> 00:39:48,030
And then people say I look like Griffith.

839
00:39:48,110 --> 00:39:51,190
And then somebody said my Final Fantasy 14 character looked like Casca.

840
00:39:51,330 --> 00:39:52,010
That's all I know.

841
00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:53,170
What the fuck are all these people?

842
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:53,450
And then Guts.

843
00:39:53,450 --> 00:39:53,570
Just a guy.

844
00:39:54,070 --> 00:39:54,670
I just...

845
00:39:54,670 --> 00:39:57,170
I just know about the horse.

846
00:39:57,350 --> 00:39:57,610
The horse.

847
00:39:57,610 --> 00:39:59,750
Yeah, everybody in chat is saying the horse.

848
00:39:59,770 --> 00:40:00,190
Yes.

849
00:40:00,430 --> 00:40:02,070
The horse.

850
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:02,930
That's the...

851
00:40:03,130 --> 00:40:06,270
No, no, you would not be laughing when you know what that scene is.

852
00:40:06,370 --> 00:40:07,570
It's so fucked up.

853
00:40:07,810 --> 00:40:10,450
I like horse related content.

854
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:11,650
Would this be good or bad?

855
00:40:12,070 --> 00:40:13,210
Okay, what do you think?

856
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:15,290
If people are like, oh no, a horse.

857
00:40:15,690 --> 00:40:17,990
What there's... where does your mind go to?

858
00:40:20,130 --> 00:40:21,130
My little pony?

859
00:40:23,490 --> 00:40:23,930
Okay.

860
00:40:23,930 --> 00:40:25,150
That's the other spectrum.

861
00:40:25,410 --> 00:40:26,930
What's the other side of that?

862
00:40:27,450 --> 00:40:28,930
And what's the other...

863
00:40:28,930 --> 00:40:30,330
So in the face of this keyboard.

864
00:40:30,330 --> 00:40:31,330
Here you sit.

865
00:40:31,710 --> 00:40:33,190
That's the fucking pony spectrum.

866
00:40:33,530 --> 00:40:36,270
That's one... that's like one end.

867
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:37,570
That's the left side.

868
00:40:37,730 --> 00:40:42,390
Where do you think the right side of that other side is regarding horses?

869
00:40:43,910 --> 00:40:44,790
Actually, I shouldn't.

870
00:40:44,830 --> 00:40:47,190
I don't feel like I should be talking about this.

871
00:40:48,830 --> 00:40:50,950
Just so you know, it's not...

872
00:40:50,950 --> 00:40:52,270
There's a lot of ways that I could be worried right now.

873
00:40:52,710 --> 00:40:56,030
That's... that's not... it's not a good scene.

874
00:40:56,150 --> 00:40:59,670
I'll just say it's definitely not appropriate for Roblox.

875
00:41:00,330 --> 00:41:01,250
That's for sure.

876
00:41:01,730 --> 00:41:04,370
Do not... do not search it up.

877
00:41:05,090 --> 00:41:06,450
Mads, don't put me in Roblox.

878
00:41:06,510 --> 00:41:07,830
Don't put me in the Roblox category.

879
00:41:07,990 --> 00:41:08,910
They're not ready for me.

880
00:41:09,070 --> 00:41:09,630
They're not ready.

881
00:41:09,630 --> 00:41:10,730
Just so you know, we're playing games and demos.

882
00:41:11,350 --> 00:41:12,270
Oh my god!

883
00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:15,050
Okay guys, I know we haven't started the Roblox stream.

884
00:41:15,190 --> 00:41:19,430
You know, like, Twitch contacted me to like headline one of their Twitch rivals.

885
00:41:19,930 --> 00:41:20,550
Oh yeah?

886
00:41:20,610 --> 00:41:21,070
And then like...

887
00:41:23,130 --> 00:41:25,670
What is... what is this stat?

888
00:41:25,710 --> 00:41:29,810
Cause like, they saw my schedule and they were like, yo, Doki.

889
00:41:30,550 --> 00:41:34,990
Do you wanna headline the Roblox Twitch Rivals?

890
00:41:36,930 --> 00:41:39,890
So Roblox Twitch Rivals is like just fucking inviting?

891
00:41:41,990 --> 00:41:44,330
I was like, who are you gonna play?

892
00:41:44,570 --> 00:41:46,110
Are you gonna play the shooting game?

893
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:47,530
Bro, I don't fucking know.

894
00:41:47,710 --> 00:41:51,710
They were like, they were like, do you wanna headline the Roblox Twitch Rivals?

895
00:41:51,970 --> 00:41:56,710
And I was like, bro, I don't play Twitch... I don't play Roblox.

896
00:41:56,850 --> 00:41:58,310
That's so fucking funny.

897
00:42:00,450 --> 00:42:01,550
Oh, you should headline!

898
00:42:01,970 --> 00:42:02,990
That's fucking fantastic!

899
00:42:04,170 --> 00:42:05,190
No, no, you know what?

900
00:42:05,310 --> 00:42:07,550
You might get a lot of children from that.

901
00:42:07,590 --> 00:42:08,490
That's not a good idea.

902
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:10,370
Yeah, that might be wrong audience.

903
00:42:11,110 --> 00:42:12,230
When worlds collide.

904
00:42:12,850 --> 00:42:14,010
I said it was screenshot.

905
00:42:14,150 --> 00:42:17,930
I don't wanna play this game, but it keeps... it's on the front page and I really don't like...

906
00:42:17,930 --> 00:42:19,210
The Twilight Daycare?

907
00:42:19,550 --> 00:42:22,430
Wait, is this where we're like babysitters?

908
00:42:22,590 --> 00:42:23,410
Are we gonna...

909
00:42:23,410 --> 00:42:25,090
There's like 20 babysitter games.

910
00:42:25,450 --> 00:42:26,350
Oh no.

911
00:42:26,910 --> 00:42:28,170
I'll take you to the best one.

912
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:29,190
Okay, okay, okay.

913
00:42:29,230 --> 00:42:29,470
Alright.

914
00:42:29,790 --> 00:42:30,710
Tell me when.

915
00:42:30,830 --> 00:42:31,390
Tell me when.

916
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:33,830
Guys, the Roblox content starts now for real.

917
00:42:35,810 --> 00:42:37,070
I'll take you to the first one.

918
00:42:37,130 --> 00:42:37,910
This one's a classic.

919
00:42:38,050 --> 00:42:40,230
I know a lot of people will probably be wanting this one.

920
00:42:40,350 --> 00:42:41,710
Cause it's just so good.

921
00:42:41,830 --> 00:42:42,710
So this is Raise a Peter.

922
00:42:44,050 --> 00:42:44,710
Raise a Peter.

923
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:46,130
Oh, I heard about this game!

924
00:42:46,370 --> 00:42:47,530
You raised Peter Griffin!

925
00:42:48,370 --> 00:42:48,830
Yeah, yeah!

926
00:42:48,910 --> 00:42:50,690
Oh my god, now you'll finally experience it.

927
00:42:50,970 --> 00:42:53,210
If Peter stars, you lose your save.

928
00:42:53,330 --> 00:42:53,570
What?

929
00:42:56,130 --> 00:42:57,250
Oh right, I gotta like...

930
00:42:57,250 --> 00:42:58,570
Put the game on the screen.

931
00:42:59,170 --> 00:42:59,810
Hold on.

932
00:42:59,970 --> 00:43:01,530
Okay, open Roblox.

933
00:43:01,570 --> 00:43:02,510
How do I find you?

934
00:43:04,350 --> 00:43:06,450
I think it'll prioritize friends.

935
00:43:06,830 --> 00:43:07,190
Oh, okay.

936
00:43:07,190 --> 00:43:10,190
So like if we're friends, it should just put us in the same world, I think.

937
00:43:10,270 --> 00:43:12,910
Alright guys, Roblox content actually starting now.

938
00:43:13,050 --> 00:43:13,630
For real.

939
00:43:14,230 --> 00:43:20,430
Sorry, we had like a 45 minute podcast going in, but for real, we're starting.

940
00:43:25,030 --> 00:43:27,910
Alright, so if I click play, then it'll go straight to you?

941
00:43:28,590 --> 00:43:29,410
I think so.

942
00:43:29,910 --> 00:43:30,610
Oh, I've joined you!

943
00:43:30,690 --> 00:43:31,910
Yeah, you've joined us already!

944
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:35,170
Okay, I'm gonna click play before I show my screen.

945
00:43:36,350 --> 00:43:36,710
Alright.

946
00:43:36,890 --> 00:43:38,030
Oh wait, actually I shouldn't.

947
00:43:38,030 --> 00:43:39,110
Guys, I have to select a lobby.

948
00:43:39,310 --> 00:43:40,930
Wait, how do I find your lobby?

949
00:43:41,630 --> 00:43:43,130
I haven't selected it yet.

950
00:43:43,150 --> 00:43:44,390
I'm trying to figure out how... Oh, here we go.

951
00:43:44,470 --> 00:43:45,310
It has to be a window.

952
00:43:45,390 --> 00:43:46,150
That's what it is.

953
00:43:46,310 --> 00:43:46,670
Okay.

954
00:43:47,810 --> 00:43:48,170
Chat?

955
00:43:48,870 --> 00:43:49,710
Get out of my face.

956
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:50,270
Whoa!

957
00:43:53,010 --> 00:43:54,230
Quit hassling me, bro.

958
00:43:54,750 --> 00:43:56,010
Okay, uh...

959
00:43:56,510 --> 00:43:58,750
Can we move us a little lower?

960
00:43:59,790 --> 00:44:00,730
I'm so confused.

961
00:44:02,030 --> 00:44:04,570
I'm just doing my own little stream thing.

962
00:44:04,610 --> 00:44:06,410
I'm trying to put the game on the stream.

963
00:44:06,530 --> 00:44:07,770
There's invite friends.

964
00:44:07,810 --> 00:44:09,490
Oh, you can invite me, right?

965
00:44:09,790 --> 00:44:10,290
Oh, oh, oh.

966
00:44:13,170 --> 00:44:14,310
Yeah, yeah, okay.

967
00:44:14,570 --> 00:44:15,350
Is this good?

968
00:44:15,430 --> 00:44:15,790
Is this good?

969
00:44:15,870 --> 00:44:18,430
Okay, I think this is kind of centered.

970
00:44:18,430 --> 00:44:18,910
What is this?

971
00:44:19,710 --> 00:44:19,850
Oh, it's centered.

972
00:44:19,850 --> 00:44:21,530
Oh no, it's not centered at all.

973
00:44:21,770 --> 00:44:21,930
Okay.

974
00:44:22,110 --> 00:44:24,290
Ba da da ba ba da ba ba.

975
00:44:24,790 --> 00:44:26,010
Ba da da da.

976
00:44:27,930 --> 00:44:29,250
You okay there?

977
00:44:30,110 --> 00:44:33,150
Classic, classic copywritten free music.

978
00:44:33,310 --> 00:44:34,290
Whatever the heck.

979
00:44:34,390 --> 00:44:34,990
What is this called?

980
00:44:35,170 --> 00:44:36,350
Copyright license free?

981
00:44:36,970 --> 00:44:37,810
Copyright license?

982
00:44:37,830 --> 00:44:38,550
Copyright free?

983
00:44:39,630 --> 00:44:40,330
Copyright free?

984
00:44:42,030 --> 00:44:43,630
Okay, I'm gonna create...

985
00:44:43,630 --> 00:44:44,870
Lobby title?

986
00:44:45,450 --> 00:44:45,970
Doki...

987
00:44:47,250 --> 00:44:47,770
Schnuffy.

988
00:44:48,810 --> 00:44:49,650
Lobby password?

989
00:44:49,870 --> 00:44:50,810
I'll have it be the same.

990
00:44:51,250 --> 00:44:52,030
God damn it.

991
00:44:52,070 --> 00:44:52,850
No wait, this time I'll know the...

992
00:44:52,850 --> 00:44:53,490
It shows on the screen.

993
00:44:53,710 --> 00:44:56,770
This time I'll definitely know how to insert my password.

994
00:44:59,350 --> 00:45:00,490
I'm gonna screenshot it.

995
00:45:00,690 --> 00:45:01,130
Okay.

996
00:45:01,210 --> 00:45:04,010
It shows on the stream just...

997
00:45:04,490 --> 00:45:04,950
Okay, I see it.

998
00:45:04,950 --> 00:45:05,850
Inappropriate lobby name.

999
00:45:05,950 --> 00:45:06,530
Okay, hold on.

1000
00:45:06,550 --> 00:45:06,870
That doesn't work.

1001
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:07,790
Okay, yeah, don't... guys.

1002
00:45:08,230 --> 00:45:10,910
Stuffy, I literally just spent $30 on Robux.

1003
00:45:10,970 --> 00:45:11,630
Don't get me back.

1004
00:45:13,710 --> 00:45:14,150
Oh, royalty free.

1005
00:45:14,150 --> 00:45:14,550
Oh, royalty free.

1006
00:45:16,170 --> 00:45:17,490
Oh, royalty free.

1007
00:45:17,490 --> 00:45:19,110
That's what they say.

1008
00:45:19,490 --> 00:45:21,110
Stuffy, I literally spent $30.

1009
00:45:21,210 --> 00:45:22,530
I need my Robux, man.

1010
00:45:23,530 --> 00:45:25,950
Okay, surely the... wait, it just disappeared.

1011
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:32,510
Look, she's trying her best right now.

1012
00:45:32,810 --> 00:45:34,590
She's trying... she...

1013
00:45:34,590 --> 00:45:36,390
It keeps disappearing every time I...

1014
00:45:36,390 --> 00:45:38,790
She ate graphite as a kid, guys.

1015
00:45:38,990 --> 00:45:39,390
Don't...

1016
00:45:40,710 --> 00:45:41,270
Please.

1017
00:45:41,590 --> 00:45:43,430
Doki, your whole name is appropriate.

1018
00:45:43,630 --> 00:45:44,090
I don't know...

1019
00:45:44,090 --> 00:45:44,830
Please understand.

1020
00:45:45,550 --> 00:45:48,030
Is my name a hate speech?

1021
00:45:52,470 --> 00:45:53,510
There's no way.

1022
00:45:54,590 --> 00:45:56,990
Okay, this one... this'll be good.

1023
00:45:57,070 --> 00:45:57,730
That works.

1024
00:45:58,110 --> 00:45:58,630
Okay.

1025
00:45:59,530 --> 00:46:00,050
Okay.

1026
00:46:01,390 --> 00:46:03,130
I almost read it out loud.

1027
00:46:03,370 --> 00:46:04,870
It's so fucking ridiculous.

1028
00:46:05,410 --> 00:46:06,970
Okay, you got invited me.

1029
00:46:07,070 --> 00:46:07,630
Oh, I see you!

1030
00:46:08,490 --> 00:46:09,010
Yeah!

1031
00:46:09,190 --> 00:46:11,550
Wait, I don't know if that's the right one.

1032
00:46:11,730 --> 00:46:12,390
No, okay.

1033
00:46:12,850 --> 00:46:14,990
It should say Doki Schnuffy.

1034
00:46:15,210 --> 00:46:16,650
Yeah, yeah, I saw that name.

1035
00:46:17,070 --> 00:46:17,590
Okay.

1036
00:46:19,010 --> 00:46:19,530
Uh...

1037
00:46:22,510 --> 00:46:23,070
Yeah.

1038
00:46:23,450 --> 00:46:23,750
Yeah!

1039
00:46:24,050 --> 00:46:24,530
I'm in!

1040
00:46:25,410 --> 00:46:26,450
Alright, alright, guys.

1041
00:46:26,530 --> 00:46:28,510
We can finally show the screen now.

1042
00:46:29,170 --> 00:46:29,730
Yeah!

1043
00:46:30,130 --> 00:46:32,630
It took us... it took us a while.

1044
00:46:34,630 --> 00:46:36,530
I think this is it, right?

1045
00:46:40,870 --> 00:46:44,250
Please use windowed or... wait, what?

1046
00:46:44,690 --> 00:46:45,710
Isn't this window?

1047
00:46:46,350 --> 00:46:47,350
Are you using windowed mode?

1048
00:46:47,570 --> 00:46:48,590
Yeah, I am.

1049
00:46:48,930 --> 00:46:49,610
Okay, but I'm not sure if that's the right one.

1050
00:46:50,370 --> 00:46:51,730
You do slowly... oh, oh yeah.

1051
00:46:51,810 --> 00:46:53,210
Are you able to capture the game?

1052
00:46:53,290 --> 00:46:54,190
Wait, wait, give me a sec.

1053
00:46:54,690 --> 00:46:56,850
It says, please use window... wait.

1054
00:47:00,070 --> 00:47:02,870
Guys, we are going through some technical difficulties.

1055
00:47:04,130 --> 00:47:05,450
Wait, what's the problem?

1056
00:47:05,590 --> 00:47:06,410
What's the problem?

1057
00:47:06,590 --> 00:47:08,790
Am I not in window... oh, wait, yeah, I am!

1058
00:47:08,830 --> 00:47:09,970
I'm in windowed mode!

1059
00:47:11,270 --> 00:47:13,610
Do you have to capture it as a window and not a game?

1060
00:47:13,750 --> 00:47:15,070
It didn't work as a game for me.

1061
00:47:15,410 --> 00:47:15,530
Oh!

1062
00:47:15,530 --> 00:47:15,970
Oh!

1063
00:47:18,290 --> 00:47:19,770
Wait, how the fuck do you do...

1064
00:47:21,530 --> 00:47:23,550
Okay, wait, we have figured it out, guys.

1065
00:47:23,710 --> 00:47:24,690
I figured it out.

1066
00:47:25,750 --> 00:47:26,670
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1067
00:47:26,750 --> 00:47:27,770
Oh, I did it.

1068
00:47:27,810 --> 00:47:28,710
I figured it out.

1069
00:47:28,850 --> 00:47:29,670
There we go.

1070
00:47:29,750 --> 00:47:30,750
Now we got it.

1071
00:47:31,590 --> 00:47:32,530
Okay, here we go.

1072
00:47:33,890 --> 00:47:34,830
Oh, there's our Peter.

1073
00:47:36,090 --> 00:47:36,910
There he is.

1074
00:47:36,990 --> 00:47:37,670
He's running around.

1075
00:47:38,670 --> 00:47:39,510
That's our child.

1076
00:47:39,890 --> 00:47:41,030
I'm so happy.

1077
00:47:41,190 --> 00:47:42,210
I accidentally zoomed in.

1078
00:47:43,890 --> 00:47:44,850
He's so big!

1079
00:47:45,530 --> 00:47:46,510
I'm so... give me a sec.

1080
00:47:46,630 --> 00:47:48,470
Cause like my alt key is...

1081
00:47:49,970 --> 00:47:50,970
Okay, here we go.

1082
00:47:51,210 --> 00:47:51,910
Guys, look!

1083
00:47:51,990 --> 00:47:52,490
It's our Peter!

1084
00:47:52,710 --> 00:47:53,430
It's our child!

1085
00:47:54,470 --> 00:47:55,510
Let me zoom.

1086
00:47:56,530 --> 00:47:57,470
Okay, here we go.

1087
00:47:58,410 --> 00:47:58,870
Alright.

1088
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:03,110
After many technical difficulties, we made it.

1089
00:48:03,350 --> 00:48:06,890
We're finally playing Roblox.

1090
00:48:08,970 --> 00:48:09,430
Hurry!

1091
00:48:10,330 --> 00:48:11,950
We finally made it!

1092
00:48:12,170 --> 00:48:13,290
We made it!

1093
00:48:13,350 --> 00:48:14,430
Yeah, we're playing a game!

1094
00:48:14,430 --> 00:48:14,850
Okay.

1095
00:48:15,090 --> 00:48:17,410
Peter slowly loses hunger over time.

1096
00:48:17,550 --> 00:48:19,050
Buy burgers to keep him alive.

1097
00:48:19,390 --> 00:48:22,150
You can buy burgers at the gas station across the road.

1098
00:48:22,710 --> 00:48:23,150
Wait.

1099
00:48:23,210 --> 00:48:23,690
Oh, there's me!

1100
00:48:23,890 --> 00:48:24,710
Guys, am I beautiful?

1101
00:48:25,270 --> 00:48:26,990
Mmm, head burger, head burger.

1102
00:48:29,590 --> 00:48:30,690
You look great!

1103
00:48:30,710 --> 00:48:31,910
Guys, am I beautiful?

1104
00:48:32,730 --> 00:48:36,790
You look like you'd be the most thirsted character on a horror video or something.

1105
00:48:37,030 --> 00:48:37,190
Oh my gosh.

1106
00:48:37,590 --> 00:48:38,250
That's great.

1107
00:48:38,570 --> 00:48:39,510
Oh wait, he's dying.

1108
00:48:39,690 --> 00:48:40,470
Our Peter's dying.

1109
00:48:40,810 --> 00:48:41,150
He's the...

1110
00:48:41,150 --> 00:48:42,090
He is!

1111
00:48:42,270 --> 00:48:43,990
No, he's only ten... Oh, he's slowly losing... Oh, wait, wait.

1112
00:48:43,990 --> 00:48:44,870
He's slowly losing health.

1113
00:48:44,970 --> 00:48:45,390
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1114
00:48:45,450 --> 00:48:46,130
What do we do?

1115
00:48:46,970 --> 00:48:48,050
How do we save him?

1116
00:48:48,090 --> 00:48:49,470
Oh, watch how we're crossing the road.

1117
00:48:49,570 --> 00:48:50,250
The cars won't stop.

1118
00:48:50,310 --> 00:48:50,750
Will we die?

1119
00:48:53,050 --> 00:48:53,690
Oh, I did it.

1120
00:48:53,810 --> 00:48:53,870
Oh, nice.

1121
00:48:57,050 --> 00:48:57,430
What?

1122
00:48:57,530 --> 00:48:58,190
I died!

1123
00:48:59,190 --> 00:48:59,570
What?

1124
00:48:59,990 --> 00:49:00,910
What the fuck?

1125
00:49:00,950 --> 00:49:01,830
You killed me!

1126
00:49:03,290 --> 00:49:04,410
What the fuck?

1127
00:49:04,450 --> 00:49:05,130
I did it again.

1128
00:49:10,110 --> 00:49:10,490
Bro!

1129
00:49:10,490 --> 00:49:10,870
Okay.

1130
00:49:10,870 --> 00:49:13,610
Okay, maybe I should cross the road.

1131
00:49:15,070 --> 00:49:17,450
I took a single stab.

1132
00:49:19,370 --> 00:49:21,530
How the fuck did you die?

1133
00:49:23,190 --> 00:49:24,910
Okay, I bought two burgers.

1134
00:49:25,670 --> 00:49:26,310
Okay.

1135
00:49:27,010 --> 00:49:27,650
What?

1136
00:49:27,930 --> 00:49:28,270
Poor gear.

1137
00:49:28,890 --> 00:49:30,430
Let's purchase poor gear.

1138
00:49:30,670 --> 00:49:31,450
How do I purchase?

1139
00:49:31,790 --> 00:49:32,850
I'm trying to purchase.

1140
00:49:34,950 --> 00:49:35,910
Stealing is illegal.

1141
00:49:37,190 --> 00:49:37,830
I got one.

1142
00:49:40,870 --> 00:49:41,410
I'm sorry.

1143
00:49:46,330 --> 00:49:47,810
I didn't know.

1144
00:49:47,930 --> 00:49:49,990
I thought I bought it.

1145
00:49:50,050 --> 00:49:51,210
I'm gonna die.

1146
00:49:52,210 --> 00:49:54,530
Today is my last day alive.

1147
00:49:55,710 --> 00:49:58,050
I'm going to die from cardiac arrest.

1148
00:49:58,510 --> 00:49:59,150
How do I?

1149
00:49:59,210 --> 00:50:00,230
How do we buy burger?

1150
00:50:00,730 --> 00:50:04,270
I gotta like... I gotta like mute and like cough horrendously.

1151
00:50:06,910 --> 00:50:07,510
What?

1152
00:50:07,830 --> 00:50:08,750
Okay, wait, wait.

1153
00:50:08,750 --> 00:50:09,310
I got this.

1154
00:50:09,390 --> 00:50:10,030
I buy burger.

1155
00:50:10,710 --> 00:50:11,190
Burger.

1156
00:50:11,190 --> 00:50:11,590
Burger?

1157
00:50:12,010 --> 00:50:13,130
Oh, there you go.

1158
00:50:13,910 --> 00:50:17,030
Alright, we lost a lot of money but I bought the burger, guys.

1159
00:50:17,930 --> 00:50:20,490
Hey, would it be so wrong to like...

1160
00:50:20,490 --> 00:50:22,730
I gotta like, tinkle really quick.

1161
00:50:24,890 --> 00:50:27,330
Before I laugh so hard, it's not gonna be...

1162
00:50:27,330 --> 00:50:27,710
It's okay!

1163
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:29,690
I'm gonna feed our Peter!

1164
00:50:30,330 --> 00:50:31,110
Oh my god.

1165
00:50:31,110 --> 00:50:31,630
Feed Peter.

1166
00:50:31,630 --> 00:50:32,950
Don't worry, I got it.

1167
00:50:33,010 --> 00:50:34,390
I bought... I got the food.

1168
00:50:35,210 --> 00:50:36,390
I'm filling it up!

1169
00:50:36,630 --> 00:50:39,370
Burger refills 25 of Peter hunger.

1170
00:50:40,030 --> 00:50:43,970
In addition to buying burgers, you can buy items from the PeterNet.

1171
00:50:44,170 --> 00:50:45,670
What do I do with the PeterNet?

1172
00:50:46,230 --> 00:50:46,710
Okay.

1173
00:50:47,610 --> 00:50:48,210
Let's see.

1174
00:50:48,350 --> 00:50:49,070
Open door.

1175
00:50:49,610 --> 00:50:50,670
Guys, I'm exploring.

1176
00:50:50,870 --> 00:50:51,530
Oh my god!

1177
00:50:51,650 --> 00:50:52,850
I can buy a phone!

1178
00:50:54,170 --> 00:50:57,670
Guys, I'm gonna spend my money because Snuffy is not here to stop me.

1179
00:50:58,750 --> 00:51:01,610
There are basics of Peter... Rays of Peter.

1180
00:51:01,790 --> 00:51:03,890
There's a lot more to explore so have fun!

1181
00:51:04,390 --> 00:51:04,870
Okay.

1182
00:51:05,530 --> 00:51:06,930
I got a phone for my Peter.

1183
00:51:07,170 --> 00:51:07,910
What does that do?

1184
00:51:08,850 --> 00:51:09,930
Peter, you have friends.

1185
00:51:09,930 --> 00:51:11,430
What are you gonna do?

1186
00:51:11,490 --> 00:51:12,170
Call your friends?

1187
00:51:13,210 --> 00:51:13,730
Peter...

1188
00:51:14,950 --> 00:51:15,470
Peter...

1189
00:51:15,470 --> 00:51:16,170
Peter.

1190
00:51:16,770 --> 00:51:16,990
Peter.

1191
00:51:19,870 --> 00:51:20,390
Peter.

1192
00:51:20,790 --> 00:51:21,070
Peter.

1193
00:51:21,070 --> 00:51:22,310
What does he do with the phone?

1194
00:51:22,330 --> 00:51:22,690
What does he do with the phone?

1195
00:51:23,730 --> 00:51:24,630
Instructions unclear!

1196
00:51:27,950 --> 00:51:29,070
Freaking sweet Liz!

1197
00:51:30,890 --> 00:51:31,770
Alright, guys.

1198
00:51:32,050 --> 00:51:32,870
I can't...

1199
00:51:32,870 --> 00:51:33,130
Oh!

1200
00:51:33,330 --> 00:51:34,290
I got to unbox!

1201
00:51:35,050 --> 00:51:35,570
Alright.

1202
00:51:37,010 --> 00:51:37,870
No, wait.

1203
00:51:37,970 --> 00:51:38,410
No, no.

1204
00:51:38,410 --> 00:51:39,810
Did I actually donate it?

1205
00:51:39,910 --> 00:51:40,870
Oh no!

1206
00:51:41,490 --> 00:51:42,090
Did I?

1207
00:51:43,190 --> 00:51:44,290
Okay, no I didn't.

1208
00:51:44,330 --> 00:51:44,890
Thank god.

1209
00:51:45,030 --> 00:51:46,490
I don't want to donate money.

1210
00:51:47,530 --> 00:51:48,670
Oh, is this the phone?

1211
00:51:49,470 --> 00:51:50,250
Call somebody.

1212
00:51:50,590 --> 00:51:51,210
I need to...

1213
00:51:51,210 --> 00:51:52,510
Gives you his money.

1214
00:51:52,610 --> 00:51:53,170
Oh, I can call.

1215
00:51:53,370 --> 00:51:54,670
I called Joe Swanson.

1216
00:51:55,550 --> 00:51:55,990
Yo!

1217
00:51:56,430 --> 00:51:57,670
Snuffy, I spent all our money.

1218
00:51:58,650 --> 00:51:59,870
We didn't even do anything.

1219
00:51:59,870 --> 00:52:01,450
I spent all our money on a phone.

1220
00:52:02,350 --> 00:52:04,450
Peter is hungry but the fridge is empty!

1221
00:52:04,750 --> 00:52:05,750
Peter is starving!

1222
00:52:05,970 --> 00:52:06,450
Don't keep him!

1223
00:52:06,910 --> 00:52:08,350
But I got us a phone!

1224
00:52:10,830 --> 00:52:11,230
Look!

1225
00:52:11,290 --> 00:52:12,030
I got Joe!

1226
00:52:13,290 --> 00:52:14,470
What is he going for?

1227
00:52:14,570 --> 00:52:14,830
I got Joe!

1228
00:52:14,950 --> 00:52:16,310
He's going to give us money!

1229
00:52:17,250 --> 00:52:17,930
Rob him!

1230
00:52:18,770 --> 00:52:19,330
How do I?

1231
00:52:19,630 --> 00:52:21,450
Okay, I'm going to make...

1232
00:52:21,450 --> 00:52:22,710
Hey, Peter.

1233
00:52:23,470 --> 00:52:24,270
Hey, Peter.

1234
00:52:24,370 --> 00:52:25,570
Give me all your money.

1235
00:52:25,670 --> 00:52:27,070
You should raise your... how much?

1236
00:52:27,130 --> 00:52:27,330
Okay.

1237
00:52:27,410 --> 00:52:28,310
Give me all your money.

1238
00:52:28,430 --> 00:52:28,810
Look!

1239
00:52:28,890 --> 00:52:29,110
See?

1240
00:52:29,770 --> 00:52:30,810
Give me all your money.

1241
00:52:33,990 --> 00:52:35,430
He now makes $120!

1242
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:37,310
Oh my god!

1243
00:52:37,350 --> 00:52:38,790
I can buy so many burgers now!

1244
00:52:38,870 --> 00:52:39,490
Go buy burger!

1245
00:52:39,650 --> 00:52:39,890
Are you going to buy burger?

1246
00:52:39,910 --> 00:52:40,090
Oh my god!

1247
00:52:40,090 --> 00:52:40,470
Peter is dying!

1248
00:52:40,550 --> 00:52:41,430
He has 24 health!

1249
00:52:42,010 --> 00:52:42,610
Oh my god!

1250
00:52:42,630 --> 00:52:43,470
Okay, I'm bringing it!

1251
00:52:43,510 --> 00:52:43,810
I'm bringing it!

1252
00:52:44,230 --> 00:52:45,510
Don't fucking die from the car!

1253
00:52:45,550 --> 00:52:46,690
We only have a dollar left!

1254
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:48,110
There's no car this late at night!

1255
00:52:48,110 --> 00:52:48,270
Okay, okay, okay.

1256
00:52:48,730 --> 00:52:49,410
I got...

1257
00:52:50,410 --> 00:52:51,870
Don't worry, I got like...

1258
00:52:52,530 --> 00:52:54,270
Don't worry, I'm going to go buy more burgers too.

1259
00:52:54,470 --> 00:52:54,850
Oh my god!

1260
00:52:54,870 --> 00:52:56,030
He's so close to dying!

1261
00:52:56,050 --> 00:52:57,230
Yeah, he's so close to dying!

1262
00:52:58,030 --> 00:52:58,970
Don't worry, I'm picking it up.

1263
00:52:59,550 --> 00:52:59,870
Okay.

1264
00:53:01,590 --> 00:53:02,110
Here you go.

1265
00:53:03,090 --> 00:53:04,870
I need another $25!

1266
00:53:06,090 --> 00:53:07,330
I don't know how to drop items!

1267
00:53:07,330 --> 00:53:09,350
I actually picked up a lot of items.

1268
00:53:11,230 --> 00:53:13,650
You robbed the store and got all of those items?

1269
00:53:14,150 --> 00:53:15,110
You robbed the store and got all of those items?

1270
00:53:15,170 --> 00:53:16,690
Stuffy, I need $25!

1271
00:53:17,330 --> 00:53:19,950
Stuffy, I don't know how to drop my items!

1272
00:53:20,890 --> 00:53:21,230
Stuffy, I need $25!

1273
00:53:21,230 --> 00:53:22,150
Oh, okay, okay, wait, wait, wait.

1274
00:53:22,230 --> 00:53:23,890
Peter will bless us.

1275
00:53:24,310 --> 00:53:25,310
Peter will bless us.

1276
00:53:25,310 --> 00:53:25,950
What do I do?

1277
00:53:26,610 --> 00:53:27,150
There we go.

1278
00:53:27,190 --> 00:53:28,330
I clicked him and he gave me money.

1279
00:53:28,390 --> 00:53:29,690
Oh my god, if you click him, he gives you money!

1280
00:53:29,750 --> 00:53:30,530
It's like cookie clicker!

1281
00:53:30,870 --> 00:53:31,630
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

1282
00:53:33,010 --> 00:53:33,690
You wanna...

1283
00:53:35,770 --> 00:53:36,330
Doki?

1284
00:53:36,650 --> 00:53:37,750
Doki, I heard a gun!

1285
00:53:38,410 --> 00:53:39,270
Everything's okay.

1286
00:53:44,050 --> 00:53:44,850
Everything's okay.

1287
00:53:44,970 --> 00:53:45,590
We got it.

1288
00:53:47,310 --> 00:53:49,430
I'm gonna go buy more burgers!

1289
00:53:49,890 --> 00:53:50,770
I'm gonna go buy more burgers!

1290
00:53:50,870 --> 00:53:52,930
I'm gonna go buy more burgers!

1291
00:53:52,930 --> 00:53:55,470
Don't worry, I got us another burger!

1292
00:53:55,930 --> 00:53:57,430
I got us two burgers!

1293
00:53:57,670 --> 00:53:58,970
Don't worry, I'm doing it!

1294
00:53:59,730 --> 00:54:02,650
I'll make sure Peter grows up big and strong!

1295
00:54:03,690 --> 00:54:04,950
You gotta click him for money!

1296
00:54:05,090 --> 00:54:06,790
I can have endless money now!

1297
00:54:07,030 --> 00:54:08,070
Oh, it's like cookie click!

1298
00:54:08,150 --> 00:54:09,870
It's like those AFK arenas!

1299
00:54:11,210 --> 00:54:14,490
Alright, don't worry.

1300
00:54:16,110 --> 00:54:17,630
Oh, you can call people!

1301
00:54:17,830 --> 00:54:19,330
Yeah, wow, Stuffy's so expensive!

1302
00:54:19,350 --> 00:54:20,170
Okay, I'm filling it up.

1303
00:54:21,330 --> 00:54:22,230
Okay, I got another.

1304
00:54:22,430 --> 00:54:23,570
Give me all your money!

1305
00:54:23,830 --> 00:54:25,210
Ray, you should raise your income!

1306
00:54:25,370 --> 00:54:26,170
Okay, $250.

1307
00:54:26,470 --> 00:54:27,250
We need $250.

1308
00:54:27,690 --> 00:54:28,630
Wait, do I click him?

1309
00:54:30,890 --> 00:54:32,870
Yeah, just click him and he'll start shedding.

1310
00:54:33,110 --> 00:54:33,670
Okay, okay, okay.

1311
00:54:33,690 --> 00:54:35,590
We should both click him at the same time.

1312
00:54:35,850 --> 00:54:36,990
Oh yeah, look at all this!

1313
00:54:37,190 --> 00:54:39,650
The double fingers?

1314
00:54:40,810 --> 00:54:42,170
Oh, we should get an auto clicker!

1315
00:54:45,150 --> 00:54:46,830
I'm getting a macro right now.

1316
00:54:46,850 --> 00:54:47,910
Get a macro right now?

1317
00:54:47,970 --> 00:54:48,430
Get the macro?

1318
00:54:49,590 --> 00:54:50,810
I'm programming my mouse!

1319
00:54:50,810 --> 00:54:52,570
Roblox doesn't say anything about no macro!

1320
00:54:54,770 --> 00:54:55,710
Oh my god!

1321
00:54:57,570 --> 00:54:58,970
Don't worry, I'm clicking, I'm clicking!

1322
00:54:59,610 --> 00:55:01,070
Okay, we have more burgers!

1323
00:55:01,290 --> 00:55:02,390
Okay, so like...

1324
00:55:02,390 --> 00:55:03,310
So, I'm gonna click on the burger.

1325
00:55:03,310 --> 00:55:03,430
Okay, so like...

1326
00:55:03,690 --> 00:55:05,450
We almost have $100!

1327
00:55:05,650 --> 00:55:07,290
What can we get with this money?

1328
00:55:07,590 --> 00:55:09,890
Don't worry guys, I'm a professional when it comes to...

1329
00:55:11,410 --> 00:55:12,110
I'm okay.

1330
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:18,900
Don't go outside!

1331
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:20,400
Okay, look at you!

1332
00:55:20,420 --> 00:55:20,900
You're thriving!

1333
00:55:21,420 --> 00:55:22,700
Don't go outside!

1334
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:32,660
I just see like, blowing up explosion sound effects and particles bursting into the windows.

1335
00:55:32,660 --> 00:55:32,900
Shut up!

1336
00:55:33,660 --> 00:55:35,680
Are you in like a coma?

1337
00:55:35,900 --> 00:55:37,520
I'm afraid to cross the road.

1338
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:38,200
Pick me!

1339
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:38,920
Rest me!

1340
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:39,920
Rest me!

1341
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:40,540
Step me!

1342
00:55:41,020 --> 00:55:41,780
Real quick!

1343
00:55:42,780 --> 00:55:43,820
Oh my god!

1344
00:55:44,100 --> 00:55:46,420
You just feaced out of the dirt!

1345
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:47,480
I can't!

1346
00:55:47,740 --> 00:55:48,840
Pick me up!

1347
00:55:50,540 --> 00:55:52,440
No, there's a solution!

1348
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:53,420
I can't!

1349
00:55:53,780 --> 00:55:55,420
Let me see if I can...

1350
00:55:55,420 --> 00:55:57,920
Maybe I can buy like a defib or something from the store.

1351
00:55:57,920 --> 00:55:58,640
I don't think I can!

1352
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:00,400
Oh, I just need to jump!

1353
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:01,240
Okay, I'm good.

1354
00:56:02,660 --> 00:56:02,900
I'm a queen!

1355
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:04,880
You wanna...

1356
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:07,080
We can have a drink together!

1357
00:56:07,420 --> 00:56:08,240
Wait, what is it for?

1358
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:10,440
What are the matches and the gasoline for?

1359
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:14,280
Wait, there's like ammo?

1360
00:56:15,380 --> 00:56:16,840
Wait, you played this game before!

1361
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:17,780
Why is there ammo?

1362
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:19,480
I don't know!

1363
00:56:19,740 --> 00:56:20,140
I didn't...

1364
00:56:20,140 --> 00:56:20,620
I don't know!

1365
00:56:20,740 --> 00:56:22,460
I've only like glued the game up!

1366
00:56:22,660 --> 00:56:23,560
Peter is hungry!

1367
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:24,820
Oh god dammit!

1368
00:56:24,860 --> 00:56:26,800
Oh, wait.

1369
00:56:30,180 --> 00:56:31,140
Okay, um...

1370
00:56:32,660 --> 00:56:34,500
I need to buy the burger for Peter.

1371
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:36,420
Are you... you're on a wanted list?

1372
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:37,280
Oh my god.

1373
00:56:37,380 --> 00:56:39,020
I can't drop my matches.

1374
00:56:39,260 --> 00:56:41,240
I can't drop my matches!

1375
00:56:41,340 --> 00:56:42,640
How much are the matches?

1376
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:43,740
Okay, okay.

1377
00:56:43,860 --> 00:56:46,580
You said backspace, but it's not dropping!

1378
00:56:47,340 --> 00:56:48,500
How do I drop?

1379
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:52,220
I actually do not know if you can drop items in Roblox.

1380
00:56:52,300 --> 00:56:53,700
I've never... I never knew that.

1381
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:55,040
I'm pressing backspace!

1382
00:56:55,500 --> 00:56:56,620
You liars!

1383
00:56:57,980 --> 00:56:59,460
It's not backspace!

1384
00:56:59,460 --> 00:57:00,800
I just... oh my god!

1385
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:01,800
I'd win.

1386
00:57:02,040 --> 00:57:03,180
I'd win against the car!

1387
00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:04,200
Let's just... let's just say...

1388
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:05,580
I'd fucking win.

1389
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:08,300
Oh my trash can!

1390
00:57:08,940 --> 00:57:09,860
I can throw in trash!

1391
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:12,200
Okay, I did it.

1392
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:13,980
Is Peter okay?

1393
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:15,560
He's okay.

1394
00:57:16,100 --> 00:57:17,680
Don't worry, I'm gonna buy more burgers then.

1395
00:57:18,540 --> 00:57:19,340
Yeah, he's good.

1396
00:57:19,380 --> 00:57:19,780
He's eating.

1397
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:21,100
He's healthy.

1398
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:23,660
Okay, I just realized we don't have a lot of money.

1399
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:25,540
So let me throw this...

1400
00:57:25,540 --> 00:57:26,580
We have a lot of money now.

1401
00:57:26,580 --> 00:57:27,960
Look at that, 30 bucks.

1402
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:29,840
Okay, but which one is the one I bought?

1403
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:31,260
Gotta milk him really quick.

1404
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:32,940
You're gonna milk your Peter?

1405
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:36,080
Remember to milk your Peters, guys!

1406
00:57:38,340 --> 00:57:39,020
Wait, did I?

1407
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:39,860
Oh, I already bought this.

1408
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:41,400
Don't worry, I'm going through.

1409
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:42,360
I'm crossing the road.

1410
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:44,460
Hey, look, I made it.

1411
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:46,880
Yeah!

1412
00:57:47,620 --> 00:57:50,820
It's just like how I know when you're coming home because I just see your explosions!

1413
00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:52,980
It's okay.

1414
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:54,240
It's okay, Peter!

1415
00:57:54,980 --> 00:57:56,360
I got you with the food!

1416
00:57:57,520 --> 00:57:58,880
Can I call somebody else?

1417
00:57:58,940 --> 00:58:00,000
Wait, we should call his wife.

1418
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:02,700
How much does his wife cost?

1419
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:03,540
Like, his...

1420
00:58:03,540 --> 00:58:06,580
His wife is only $250.

1421
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:10,520
We're gonna make that in no time.

1422
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:11,600
Oh my gosh.

1423
00:58:12,040 --> 00:58:14,520
Oh, our Joe makes $258!

1424
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:17,200
Okay, Peter, we're gonna call your wife.

1425
00:58:17,620 --> 00:58:18,920
We're gonna buy your wife.

1426
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:20,380
Buy her?

1427
00:58:21,020 --> 00:58:22,380
You know those mail order brides?

1428
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:23,060
Did you buy her?

1429
00:58:23,460 --> 00:58:24,180
No, not yet.

1430
00:58:24,220 --> 00:58:25,320
We need... Oh, we can buy it.

1431
00:58:25,320 --> 00:58:26,460
We can... Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1432
00:58:26,580 --> 00:58:27,400
That mail order bride.

1433
00:58:28,060 --> 00:58:30,560
Two times money and buys burgers for us.

1434
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:31,020
Oh, nice!

1435
00:58:31,240 --> 00:58:33,060
Oh, we don't have to do it anymore!

1436
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:37,420
Oh, now we're getting $2 per Peter click.

1437
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:37,940
Oh my god!

1438
00:58:37,980 --> 00:58:39,320
Wait, how did you promote your Peter?

1439
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:41,500
It's because of Lois.

1440
00:58:41,580 --> 00:58:42,520
It's the Lois buff.

1441
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:43,580
Oh, the Lois buff?

1442
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:44,460
Look at that, guys.

1443
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:47,440
When you get a wife, you can make $2 per second.

1444
00:58:48,540 --> 00:58:49,760
$2 per second?

1445
00:58:52,060 --> 00:58:54,580
Minus 10 sanity, but $2 per second.

1446
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:55,320
Minus 10 sanity, but $2 per second.

1447
00:58:55,320 --> 00:58:55,720
Minus 10 sanity, but $2 per second.

1448
00:58:57,160 --> 00:58:57,940
I hear you.

1449
00:58:58,580 --> 00:59:00,120
I wanna just click on her, dude.

1450
00:59:02,340 --> 00:59:03,020
Fuck Peter.

1451
00:59:03,020 --> 00:59:03,220
Oh my god!

1452
00:59:03,220 --> 00:59:03,800
Lois is here!

1453
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:04,720
Wait, she's leaving!

1454
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:05,920
Why is she leaving?

1455
00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:06,620
Wait, does she just...

1456
00:59:06,620 --> 00:59:07,580
She's gonna go buy burgers!

1457
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:09,080
She's gonna buy burgers for us?

1458
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:10,580
Oh my god, we don't have to do this anymore.

1459
00:59:11,640 --> 00:59:13,380
We've been promoted to just clicking Peter.

1460
00:59:13,560 --> 00:59:14,260
Don't worry, Lois.

1461
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:15,320
We'll milk Peter for you.

1462
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:18,180
Oh, hello?

1463
00:59:18,660 --> 00:59:19,060
Hello?

1464
00:59:19,360 --> 00:59:20,080
The doorbell?

1465
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:20,460
Hello?

1466
00:59:20,700 --> 00:59:21,780
Who called us?

1467
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:22,720
Hello?

1468
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:23,560
Who's that?

1469
00:59:23,720 --> 00:59:24,700
Who's walking down the street?

1470
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:25,260
Wait, what is that?

1471
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:25,880
What is that?

1472
00:59:26,100 --> 00:59:27,480
Wait, that's a prank caller!

1473
00:59:28,360 --> 00:59:30,780
We just got fucking... What do they call that?

1474
00:59:30,840 --> 00:59:31,260
Door dash?

1475
00:59:31,460 --> 00:59:32,300
Yeah, we got like...

1476
00:59:32,300 --> 00:59:33,080
Ding dong dash.

1477
00:59:33,660 --> 00:59:36,940
Door dash is the fucking Uber Eats.

1478
00:59:40,840 --> 00:59:41,720
Oh god.

1479
00:59:42,300 --> 00:59:43,920
We got door dash.

1480
00:59:48,860 --> 00:59:49,300
Peter.

1481
00:59:50,140 --> 00:59:50,740
Hey, Peter.

1482
00:59:51,340 --> 00:59:51,780
Hey.

1483
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:53,740
My favorite Family Guy character.

1484
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,660
My favorite Family Guy character?

1485
00:59:56,120 --> 00:59:58,720
I think my favorite Family Guy character...

1486
00:59:59,640 --> 01:00:00,840
Oh my gosh.

1487
01:00:00,860 --> 01:00:01,560
That's so difficult.

1488
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:02,400
There's so many.

1489
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:04,820
You remember that one...

1490
01:00:04,820 --> 01:00:06,340
One dog that was there?

1491
01:00:06,460 --> 01:00:08,120
Because they baited us when...

1492
01:00:08,630 --> 01:00:09,380
Brian died?

1493
01:00:09,880 --> 01:00:11,220
The Italian dog?

1494
01:00:13,640 --> 01:00:16,020
Did you see that...

1495
01:00:16,020 --> 01:00:16,780
Did you see that...

1496
01:00:16,780 --> 01:00:20,780
Did you see that post where like some guy got a fucking tattoo of Brian to like...

1497
01:00:20,780 --> 01:00:22,700
Did you see that...

1498
01:00:22,700 --> 01:00:25,580
Unmemoriam for him and then the day...

1499
01:00:25,580 --> 01:00:28,500
and then the day after like...

1500
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:30,160
Brian was like, not dead.

1501
01:00:32,780 --> 01:00:34,760
What do you think he tells people now?

1502
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:37,540
Like, about his tattoo of Unmemoriam Brian Crimmel?

1503
01:00:37,540 --> 01:00:41,840
Like what was that, like 2016 or something?

1504
01:00:43,660 --> 01:00:45,660
Oh my god That's like .

1505
01:00:45,660 --> 01:00:47,480
That's so smart though because like he...

1506
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:50,560
Seth MacFarlane was like, we need more ratings.

1507
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:54,900
Let's do a fake I'm like pretending to kill off Brian.

1508
01:00:56,620 --> 01:00:59,000
I feel like I felt the impact back then.

1509
01:00:59,060 --> 01:00:59,780
I don't know what it was.

1510
01:00:59,940 --> 01:01:01,420
I know, you're like, you didn't expect it.

1511
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:04,780
But when I was a kid, I think I had a crush on him.

1512
01:01:04,840 --> 01:01:05,340
I don't know why.

1513
01:01:05,380 --> 01:01:06,420
You had a crush on a dog?

1514
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:09,440
Well, I don't think that was part of it.

1515
01:01:10,900 --> 01:01:14,120
I think I liked that he was like a free thinker.

1516
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:16,000
I was like, yeah, you know, I'm an atheist.

1517
01:01:16,140 --> 01:01:17,040
I'm in middle school.

1518
01:01:17,100 --> 01:01:17,760
That's cool.

1519
01:01:18,140 --> 01:01:18,700
He's a dog.

1520
01:01:18,740 --> 01:01:19,860
I thought he was cool.

1521
01:01:19,940 --> 01:01:20,260
Yeah.

1522
01:01:20,260 --> 01:01:22,240
No, no, don't say that.

1523
01:01:22,300 --> 01:01:23,960
No, no, no, that's not what it was.

1524
01:01:23,960 --> 01:01:24,980
And he's a dog.

1525
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:26,380
No, no, no.

1526
01:01:26,820 --> 01:01:31,660
I want to give him a swirly in the toilet.

1527
01:01:32,460 --> 01:01:35,320
No, now you're just making stuff up.

1528
01:01:36,340 --> 01:01:37,420
Oh no.

1529
01:01:37,720 --> 01:01:40,280
You got caught.

1530
01:01:40,980 --> 01:01:44,200
I'm being honest with my life and you say I'm making it up.

1531
01:01:45,560 --> 01:01:49,880
I don't know if I should be like honored that like my stories are that like...

1532
01:01:51,220 --> 01:01:52,480
I'm like fables.

1533
01:01:53,140 --> 01:02:00,800
Well, it's not just not that is the fact that like him being a dog was not like the main one of the reasons why you had a crush.

1534
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:08,020
It's like people who are like, you know, people who have like crushes on like what's his name?

1535
01:02:08,060 --> 01:02:09,500
Kobu from the Lion King.

1536
01:02:09,740 --> 01:02:13,660
I bet you were one of those kids that had a crush on Kobu, weren't you?

1537
01:02:14,420 --> 01:02:16,580
No, it's like you are projecting.

1538
01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:18,100
That sounds like you know from experience.

1539
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:19,080
No, no, no.

1540
01:02:20,300 --> 01:02:22,600
Snuffy, did you had a crush on Kobu?

1541
01:02:23,220 --> 01:02:24,500
No, no, no.

1542
01:02:24,620 --> 01:02:26,460
But the girl lion could get it though.

1543
01:02:26,460 --> 01:02:26,760
Oh, nah.

1544
01:02:27,840 --> 01:02:29,060
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1545
01:02:31,060 --> 01:02:33,140
What's your Disney crush, Snuffy?

1546
01:02:33,360 --> 01:02:34,360
What's my greatest?

1547
01:02:35,300 --> 01:02:35,820
Okay.

1548
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,360
My real true like Disney crush?

1549
01:02:38,520 --> 01:02:41,580
I like Esmeralda or Megara from Hercules.

1550
01:02:41,860 --> 01:02:42,100
Oh.

1551
01:02:42,540 --> 01:02:44,280
Those are my Disney crushes.

1552
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:44,380
Humans.

1553
01:02:44,380 --> 01:02:45,020
Those are my girls.

1554
01:02:45,100 --> 01:02:45,460
Yeah.

1555
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:48,280
Beautiful women.

1556
01:02:48,700 --> 01:02:49,220
Women.

1557
01:02:50,260 --> 01:02:51,300
What about the males?

1558
01:02:51,320 --> 01:02:53,460
Who are the male crushes?

1559
01:02:53,480 --> 01:02:54,060
Disney men?

1560
01:02:55,080 --> 01:02:57,500
Now tell me there's a Disney man for you.

1561
01:02:57,740 --> 01:03:01,560
Any male characters in Disney.

1562
01:03:02,040 --> 01:03:04,100
Is there even like a memorable one?

1563
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:05,000
There has to be.

1564
01:03:11,100 --> 01:03:13,500
Why is Lois not doing her fucking job?

1565
01:03:14,540 --> 01:03:15,760
Gaston is pretty dope.

1566
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:17,400
Oh, Gaston is pretty nice.

1567
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:17,740
Yeah.

1568
01:03:20,820 --> 01:03:21,620
Get yourself...

1569
01:03:22,120 --> 01:03:23,400
We have a thousand dollars.

1570
01:03:23,580 --> 01:03:24,580
What are we gonna do with this?

1571
01:03:24,760 --> 01:03:25,480
Call his friends.

1572
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:27,820
Wait, we can buy stuff on the PeterNet.

1573
01:03:28,740 --> 01:03:29,540
The PeterNet.

1574
01:03:29,840 --> 01:03:31,320
We can give him a couch.

1575
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:33,860
I'm buying him a chair.

1576
01:03:34,460 --> 01:03:36,420
And then I'm buying him...

1577
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:38,160
Wait.

1578
01:03:39,940 --> 01:03:40,900
There's like a couch.

1579
01:03:41,080 --> 01:03:42,120
Oh, I'm buying him a chair.

1580
01:03:42,180 --> 01:03:43,160
I'm buying him two couches.

1581
01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:45,460
Okay, there's somebody like...

1582
01:03:46,060 --> 01:03:47,020

Wait, okay, now we're broke.

1585
01:03:52,020 --> 01:03:52,940
Now we're broke.

1586
01:03:53,260 --> 01:03:54,720
Wait, I can call more people.

1587
01:03:55,220 --> 01:03:57,540
There's somebody taped on her ce...

1588
01:03:57,540 --> 01:03:59,400
There's somebody taped on her ceiling?

1589
01:04:00,320 --> 01:04:01,020
Where is that?

1590
01:04:01,080 --> 01:04:02,620
Oh shit, what the fuck is that?

1591
01:04:04,020 --> 01:04:06,040
Oh, it's our stuff I ordered.

1592
01:04:06,100 --> 01:04:07,160
I ordered a couch.

1593
01:04:08,520 --> 01:04:09,880
Here she comes.

1594
01:04:10,260 --> 01:04:11,240
Here's my couch.

1595
01:04:11,560 --> 01:04:12,820
Wait, I ordered two couches.

1596
01:04:12,900 --> 01:04:13,740
Where are my two couches?

1597
01:04:15,040 --> 01:04:15,520
There.

1598
01:04:15,620 --> 01:04:16,140
One of the...

1599
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:18,920
He's gonna give us like three dollars now.

1600
01:04:19,880 --> 01:04:20,640
Oh, nice!

1601
01:04:21,140 --> 01:04:23,660
Yeah, now four dollars, cause I ordered two couches.

1602
01:04:23,840 --> 01:04:24,840
Oh, two couches.

1603
01:04:24,860 --> 01:04:26,080
It's turning into the family.

1604
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:26,360
Yeah.

1605
01:04:26,360 --> 01:04:27,500
Alright, keep clicking.

1606
01:04:27,580 --> 01:04:29,040
I'm gonna talk to Joe to give me money.

1607
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:29,520
Six dollars.

1608
01:04:30,320 --> 01:04:31,480
Oh my god, holy crap.

1609
01:04:31,780 --> 01:04:34,200
Oh my god, Joe makes five hundred dollars now.

1610
01:04:34,820 --> 01:04:36,220
Oh my god, Joe makes five hundred dollars now.

1611
01:04:36,220 --> 01:04:36,800
This is it.

1612
01:04:37,020 --> 01:04:37,620
This is it.

1613
01:04:37,640 --> 01:04:38,440
Give us your money, Peter.

1614
01:04:39,340 --> 01:04:40,180
This is it.

1615
01:04:40,900 --> 01:04:42,540
Give us your fucking money.

1616
01:04:43,060 --> 01:04:44,820
We can call his child soon.

1617
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:47,140
I'm gonna...

1618
01:04:47,140 --> 01:04:48,260
Give us your money, Peter.

1619
01:04:49,160 --> 01:04:50,420
Alright, I'm gonna go call.

1620
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:53,400
Have you seen like Seth MacFarlane's newest show, Ted?

1621
01:04:53,680 --> 01:04:54,700
The TV show?

1622
01:04:54,920 --> 01:04:55,300
Yes, yes.

1623
01:04:55,580 --> 01:04:57,100
I've seen it three times.

1624
01:04:57,280 --> 01:04:58,800
Wait, like, no, not the movie.

1625
01:04:58,840 --> 01:04:59,480
The TV show.

1626
01:04:59,840 --> 01:05:00,380
Yeah, yeah.

1627
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:01,160
Yeah, I love it.

1628
01:05:01,160 --> 01:05:03,140
Wait, you saw the TV show three times?

1629
01:05:04,520 --> 01:05:05,640
What do you think I do?

1630
01:05:05,900 --> 01:05:07,080
All I do is like...

1631
01:05:07,800 --> 01:05:10,940
I itch crotch and watch a Seth MacFarlane TV show.

1632
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:12,800
That's what I do for like eight hours a day.

1633
01:05:13,780 --> 01:05:14,920
I think you're like...

1634
01:05:14,920 --> 01:05:19,140
Your entire personality is based off of Seth MacFarlane's show.

1635
01:05:19,820 --> 01:05:20,300
Your entire personality is based off of Seth MacFarlane's show.

1636
01:05:20,300 --> 01:05:20,540
Do your...

1637
01:05:20,540 --> 01:05:22,780
Can you do a family guy impression?

1638
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:24,940
Like what character do you think you can do the best impression of?

1639
01:05:24,940 --> 01:05:26,140
Okay, definitely Joe.

1640
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:28,160
That's the only one I can do.

1641
01:05:29,460 --> 01:05:30,600
That's a good one.

1642
01:05:30,940 --> 01:05:32,160
Hey, Peter.

1643
01:05:33,300 --> 01:05:35,360
I called Brian, by the way.

1644
01:05:35,420 --> 01:05:36,280
I do it always.

1645
01:05:36,740 --> 01:05:38,800
But I don't... I haven't practiced in a while.

1646
01:05:39,080 --> 01:05:39,760
Oh, show me.

1647
01:05:40,080 --> 01:05:41,300
Show me your impression.

1648
01:05:41,840 --> 01:05:41,920
Oh, show me.

1649
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:41,920
Show me your impression.

1650
01:05:42,900 --> 01:05:44,280
Shit, how do I even do that?

1651
01:05:45,220 --> 01:05:46,280
Okay, hold on.

1652
01:05:46,320 --> 01:05:47,920
Let me mute and practice really quick.

1653
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:49,180
You're not muting.

1654
01:05:49,660 --> 01:05:50,100
Practice.

1655
01:05:50,620 --> 01:05:52,520
I did it, Peter.

1656
01:05:52,620 --> 01:05:54,180
Right off the bat.

1657
01:05:54,820 --> 01:05:56,240
You need to say practice.

1658
01:05:56,340 --> 01:05:57,220
That's great though.

1659
01:05:57,420 --> 01:05:58,580
I'm trying to try hard.

1660
01:05:58,680 --> 01:05:59,800
I'm like auditioning.

1661
01:05:59,800 --> 01:06:02,780
Are you trying to say my Joe Swanson was not good enough?

1662
01:06:03,480 --> 01:06:04,540
It was great.

1663
01:06:04,700 --> 01:06:07,380
It was great, but that's like a liberating thing to say.

1664
01:06:07,480 --> 01:06:09,900
Like who wants to show off as Lois?

1665
01:06:09,900 --> 01:06:12,240
Who wants to be like, oh man, I love Lois Brecken.

1666
01:06:12,320 --> 01:06:12,480
I love Lois Brecken.

1667
01:06:12,800 --> 01:06:13,280
Peter.

1668
01:06:15,380 --> 01:06:16,260
Wait, wait.

1669
01:06:16,340 --> 01:06:16,700
Peter.

1670
01:06:16,820 --> 01:06:18,140
The horse is here.

1671
01:06:18,340 --> 01:06:18,540
Peter.

1672
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:24,460
Peter.

1673
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:28,760
I'm so bad at it.

1674
01:06:28,840 --> 01:06:29,920
I don't know how to be forced.

1675
01:06:30,280 --> 01:06:30,760
Brecken!

1676
01:06:31,760 --> 01:06:33,780
Oh my god, he just shit on the floor.

1677
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:36,160
No, we gotta get Stewie.

1678
01:06:36,340 --> 01:06:39,320
I'm gonna call Stewie so Stewie can eat the shit.

1679
01:06:39,980 --> 01:06:41,880
Is that what happens in the movie?

1680
01:06:41,880 --> 01:06:42,180
Yeah.

1681
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:46,600
You don't know your fucking...

1682
01:06:46,600 --> 01:06:47,520
You don't know...

1683
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:48,420
Oh, what?

1684
01:06:49,480 --> 01:06:50,000
Oh.

1685
01:06:50,340 --> 01:06:52,300
You don't know your fucking family.

1686
01:06:52,320 --> 01:06:55,300
And you call yourself a Seth MacFarlane fan.

1687
01:06:56,680 --> 01:06:57,520
Where's Stewie?

1688
01:06:58,060 --> 01:06:58,860
Stewie's here.

1689
01:06:59,040 --> 01:06:59,860
He's gonna eat the shit now.

1690
01:07:06,920 --> 01:07:08,200
There's so much shit.

1691
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:10,360
Stewie, get on the fucking floor.

1692
01:07:10,360 --> 01:07:12,320
Stewie, do your job, Stewie.

1693
01:07:13,060 --> 01:07:15,500
Oh my god, he ate shit for $400.

1694
01:07:15,980 --> 01:07:16,300
Oh my god, he ate shit for $400.

1695
01:07:16,300 --> 01:07:17,440
Okay, we're fucking rich.

1696
01:07:17,560 --> 01:07:18,440
And now it's all over his face.

1697
01:07:18,620 --> 01:07:20,300
We're fucking rich now.

1698
01:07:20,620 --> 01:07:21,500
This is it.

1699
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:23,760
We're making money.

1700
01:07:24,460 --> 01:07:26,000
We're raising Peter.

1701
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:27,200
Okay, let's see.

1702
01:07:27,820 --> 01:07:30,300
Okay, we need a TV for our Peter.

1703
01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:31,580
Oh, I got TV!

1704
01:07:32,680 --> 01:07:34,240
He's only age two.

1705
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:35,620
That doesn't seem very old.

1706
01:07:35,880 --> 01:07:37,120
Okay, we got TV.

1707
01:07:37,120 --> 01:07:38,540
And then...

1708
01:07:39,120 --> 01:07:40,820
And then we got a...

1709
01:07:40,820 --> 01:07:41,880
We got another fridge.

1710
01:07:42,900 --> 01:07:43,340
Nice!

1711
01:07:43,340 --> 01:07:44,440
Wait, two fridges?

1712
01:07:44,500 --> 01:07:45,340
Double the burgs?

1713
01:07:45,360 --> 01:07:46,600
Yeah, double the burgs.

1714
01:07:47,120 --> 01:07:49,360
Okay, let me talk to Joe and threaten him for money.

1715
01:07:50,360 --> 01:07:52,600
Okay, he doesn't want to give us money yet.

1716
01:07:53,160 --> 01:07:54,260
Okay, the TV's here.

1717
01:07:54,300 --> 01:07:54,620
The TV.

1718
01:07:54,700 --> 01:07:55,420
We're getting the TV.

1719
01:07:55,520 --> 01:07:56,120
The TV's here?

1720
01:07:56,240 --> 01:07:56,540
Nice.

1721
01:07:56,840 --> 01:07:57,460
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1722
01:07:59,380 --> 01:08:00,080
Here we go.

1723
01:08:00,200 --> 01:08:01,100
I'm packing it.

1724
01:08:02,840 --> 01:08:03,540
It's beautiful.

1725
01:08:03,640 --> 01:08:04,340
Look at that!

1726
01:08:05,240 --> 01:08:07,100
Our Peter's gonna grow up big!

1727
01:08:07,120 --> 01:08:07,680
Big and strong!

1728
01:08:08,540 --> 01:08:09,660
What's this other box?

1729
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:11,440
Oh, the fridge!

1730
01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:11,780
The fridge!

1731
01:08:11,960 --> 01:08:12,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1732
01:08:13,740 --> 01:08:14,180
Guys.

1733
01:08:15,080 --> 01:08:17,360
Guys, you think we're doing a good job raising our boy?

1734
01:08:19,060 --> 01:08:19,940
He's happy!

1735
01:08:20,160 --> 01:08:20,680
He's happy!

1736
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:21,440
He's so happy!

1737
01:08:21,540 --> 01:08:22,440
We're giving him a family!

1738
01:08:22,480 --> 01:08:23,740
We're buying him a family!

1739
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,360
If Lois worked harder, he would be even happier.

1740
01:08:26,580 --> 01:08:29,120
Yeah, I like how Lois was cheaper than his child.

1741
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:33,140
He's at the truth, B!

1742
01:08:37,440 --> 01:08:40,920
Guys, every family needs a strong Peter foundation.

1743
01:08:42,500 --> 01:08:43,380
Strong Peter!

1744
01:08:44,240 --> 01:08:45,120
Hey, Peter!

1745
01:08:45,760 --> 01:08:46,640
Hey, Peter!

1746
01:08:46,660 --> 01:08:47,640
Come on, check the internet.

1747
01:08:47,860 --> 01:08:48,520
The Peter-net.

1748
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:49,180
The Petronet?

1749
01:08:49,380 --> 01:08:50,640
What are you gonna get from the Peter-net?

1750
01:08:51,220 --> 01:08:53,660
It's only $50 for a nice rug.

1751
01:08:53,760 --> 01:08:54,200
Why not?

1752
01:08:54,420 --> 01:08:55,960
Like, let us stay warm and cozy.

1753
01:08:56,420 --> 01:08:57,340
Yeah, but there's a- Oh!

1754
01:08:57,540 --> 01:08:58,120
There's a bird!

1755
01:09:00,640 --> 01:09:01,540
What do we do?

1756
01:09:01,720 --> 01:09:02,940
He's taking our stuff!

1757
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:04,360
We're large!

1758
01:09:04,580 --> 01:09:06,660
How the fuck- Oh, he took our chair!

1759
01:09:06,660 --> 01:09:08,780
He took the chair!

1760
01:09:09,440 --> 01:09:10,560
I don't know what to do!

1761
01:09:11,340 --> 01:09:13,320
You're a fucking- You're a fucking policeman!

1762
01:09:14,220 --> 01:09:15,000
This is what I need a gun for!

1763
01:09:15,200 --> 01:09:15,820
There's so many!

1764
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:17,200
There's two of them!

1765
01:09:17,280 --> 01:09:17,960
They're taking everything!

1766
01:09:18,760 --> 01:09:19,840
How do we buy a gun?

1767
01:09:19,940 --> 01:09:20,540
How do we buy a gun?

1768
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:21,340
How do we get a gun?

1769
01:09:21,360 --> 01:09:23,900
We need to protect ourselves!

1770
01:09:24,400 --> 01:09:25,960
Our first- Is it the First Amendment?

1771
01:09:26,220 --> 01:09:26,540
I don't know.

1772
01:09:26,540 --> 01:09:31,980
I thought that was like a freedom of speech or something.

1773
01:09:32,400 --> 01:09:37,600
What the- That's the- You're American!

1774
01:09:37,940 --> 01:09:39,140
Oh, it's our Second Amendment!

1775
01:09:40,260 --> 01:09:44,000
I forgot what- It's our Second Amendment!

1776
01:09:44,300 --> 01:09:45,660
We need to get a gun!

1777
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:51,880
How was I supposed to know which amendments- How many amendments do you guys even have?

1778
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:53,620
Wait, twelve?

1779
01:09:54,220 --> 01:09:55,980
That was like a religious thing.

1780
01:09:56,380 --> 01:09:56,940
What?

1781
01:09:58,460 --> 01:10:01,380
No, like the Twelve Commandments or something?

1782
01:10:03,960 --> 01:10:05,580
I'm getting the dynamite.

1783
01:10:05,620 --> 01:10:06,520
I'm gonna go buy dynamite.

1784
01:10:06,660 --> 01:10:07,260
They're backward!

1785
01:10:07,400 --> 01:10:09,200
It's the whole house or nothing.

1786
01:10:09,400 --> 01:10:11,360
I got the Fortnite Battle Pass.

1787
01:10:12,480 --> 01:10:14,460
I'm getting matches and dynamite.

1788
01:10:14,840 --> 01:10:17,080
What does the Fortnite Battle Pass gonna do for us?

1789
01:10:17,360 --> 01:10:18,160
I don't know.

1790
01:10:18,620 --> 01:10:23,620
They stole our table and our TV!

1791
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:25,320
Wait, what the fuck did they steal?

1792
01:10:25,320 --> 01:10:25,880
I paid for it!

1793
01:10:26,740 --> 01:10:30,000
You- $500?!

1794
01:10:31,540 --> 01:10:33,380
I paid for it!

1795
01:10:33,380 --> 01:10:34,220
He kicked me!

1796
01:10:34,820 --> 01:10:36,280
I paid for it!

1797
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:38,340
I'm getting robbed on both ends!

1798
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:40,400
Wait, where's the gun?

1799
01:10:40,940 --> 01:10:41,720
Where is it?

1800
01:10:43,260 --> 01:10:44,720
Where's our Second Amendment?

1801
01:10:46,860 --> 01:10:47,980
Okay, okay.

1802
01:10:48,100 --> 01:10:49,400
I'm leaving with the dynamite.

1803
01:10:49,420 --> 01:10:51,460
I'm getting another chair.

1804
01:10:52,760 --> 01:10:53,700
I'm getting chairs.

1805
01:10:54,380 --> 01:10:56,280
We can get robbed?!

1806
01:10:56,280 --> 01:10:57,680
At any moment, I'm ready.

1807
01:11:02,200 --> 01:11:04,780
Oh my god, I can't believe it!

1808
01:11:05,020 --> 01:11:05,100
Just let me know.

1809
01:11:05,100 --> 01:11:05,520
Just let me know.

1810
01:11:06,060 --> 01:11:06,440
We're going out.

1811
01:11:06,500 --> 01:11:07,040
We're going out.

1812
01:11:07,100 --> 01:11:07,760
Just let me know.

1813
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:08,860
I like this whole bullshit.

1814
01:11:09,860 --> 01:11:11,120
That's just our chairs again.

1815
01:11:11,280 --> 01:11:12,200
I got us chairs again.

1816
01:11:12,920 --> 01:11:15,580
Oh my god, this room is so scary sounding.

1817
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:16,860
I got us chairs.

1818
01:11:16,860 --> 01:11:17,200
I got us more chairs.

1819
01:11:19,260 --> 01:11:20,120
Oh yeah, Mag!

1820
01:11:20,280 --> 01:11:22,100
Wait, they took our phone!

1821
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:22,600
What?

1822
01:11:22,780 --> 01:11:25,900
We took the fucking phone!

1823
01:11:26,340 --> 01:11:29,380
Okay, apparently if you close the door, you can't get robbed.

1824
01:11:29,560 --> 01:11:30,820
You know, that's actually a good idea.

1825
01:11:31,940 --> 01:11:34,060
You can just leave our door open!

1826
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:35,240
You're so irresponsible!

1827
01:11:36,520 --> 01:11:37,720
We're irresponsible?

1828
01:11:38,280 --> 01:11:40,380
This is a group effort here!

1829
01:11:41,240 --> 01:11:42,480
We can't have...

1830
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:45,200
We are both responsible for our Peters.

1831
01:11:45,360 --> 01:11:46,740
He's begging for his fur, Peter.

1832
01:11:46,820 --> 01:11:47,840
He might wander outside.

1833
01:11:47,860 --> 01:11:50,860
He might walk outside and get hit by a car.

1834
01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:52,360
He's not...

1835
01:11:52,360 --> 01:11:52,360
he's not my kitchen!

1836
01:11:54,100 --> 01:11:56,780
How could you do this to our son?

1837
01:11:58,080 --> 01:11:59,120
Okay, wait, let's see.

1838
01:11:59,140 --> 01:12:00,200
Why did we buy a new phone?

1839
01:12:00,940 --> 01:12:02,540
Oh, I got Pierre.

1840
01:12:02,540 --> 01:12:04,080
We can fish Pierre...

1841
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:04,840
We can fish now.

1842
01:12:05,220 --> 01:12:06,600
Somebody said in the...

1843
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:09,120
In the Raise Your Peter meta...

1844
01:12:09,120 --> 01:12:12,540
Did you know there is a Raise Your Peter meta?

1845
01:12:12,700 --> 01:12:15,160
And they said that we should grab a fishing Peter.

1846
01:12:15,960 --> 01:12:17,340
A fishing Peter?

1847
01:12:17,780 --> 01:12:24,060
If we want to be very efficient in raising our Peter, we need to get a Pierre.

1848
01:12:25,740 --> 01:12:27,840
Just remember to close the door.

1849
01:12:28,040 --> 01:12:29,160
Just remember to close the door.

1850
01:12:29,480 --> 01:12:30,500
Don't worry, guys.

1851
01:12:30,640 --> 01:12:31,500
I'm gonna close the door.

1852
01:12:31,700 --> 01:12:32,100
Guys!

1853
01:12:32,540 --> 01:12:33,000
Do not worry!

1854
01:12:33,420 --> 01:12:35,480
It's not just about raising Peters.

1855
01:12:40,020 --> 01:12:41,680
It's not like you walked away.

1856
01:12:41,800 --> 01:12:43,240
Did you close like a real door?

1857
01:12:46,880 --> 01:12:48,480
I got the fishing Pierre.

1858
01:12:48,580 --> 01:12:49,740
Where the fuck is the Pierre?

1859
01:12:50,680 --> 01:12:52,420
Oh, the fishing Pierre!

1860
01:12:52,720 --> 01:12:54,100
I thought you said the fishing Peter.

1861
01:12:54,280 --> 01:12:55,620
I was like, we can double the Peters?

1862
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:57,280
Wait, where the fuck is it?

1863
01:12:57,420 --> 01:12:58,620
I don't see like a fishing thing.

1864
01:12:58,900 --> 01:13:00,340
I'm gonna try crossing the road.

1865
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,940
I saw it like show up on my street.

1866
01:13:05,940 --> 01:13:06,220
It's over here.

1867
01:13:06,340 --> 01:13:07,360
It's across the street.

1868
01:13:08,300 --> 01:13:10,400
Why is there a thing across the street?

1869
01:13:10,640 --> 01:13:10,820
Why is there a thing across the street?

1870
01:13:10,820 --> 01:13:10,860
Oh!

1871
01:13:12,560 --> 01:13:13,420
Oh no.

1872
01:13:14,500 --> 01:13:15,420
Fishing rod.

1873
01:13:15,860 --> 01:13:17,560
You got a fishing rod.

1874
01:13:19,140 --> 01:13:20,800
How do I get one?

1875
01:13:22,080 --> 01:13:23,240
Don't go outside.

1876
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:24,580
Don't go outside.

1877
01:13:24,660 --> 01:13:25,640
I'm fishing.

1878
01:13:26,500 --> 01:13:27,060
Okay.

1879
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:28,720
I don't know.

1880
01:13:28,720 --> 01:13:29,280
I don't know.

1881
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:30,700
I said purchase.

1882
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:32,720
Is it coming to the house?

1883
01:13:32,780 --> 01:13:33,580
Oh, it's getting delivered.

1884
01:13:34,520 --> 01:13:35,400
Oh, it's getting delivered?

1885
01:13:35,740 --> 01:13:36,120
Okay.

1886
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:37,960
Well, I'm gonna close the door soon.

1887
01:13:38,340 --> 01:13:39,620
I don't want to get robbed again.

1888
01:13:40,280 --> 01:13:41,660
We don't have a gun yet.

1889
01:13:41,700 --> 01:13:43,760
We haven't practiced our second amendment yet.

1890
01:13:45,680 --> 01:13:46,580
Wait, what did you...

1891
01:13:46,580 --> 01:13:47,320
I got something.

1892
01:13:48,320 --> 01:13:49,360
Is it a fishing rod?

1893
01:13:49,380 --> 01:13:56,720
Did you get the fishing rod?

1894
01:13:57,920 --> 01:13:59,360
And I can get Quagmire!

1895
01:13:59,720 --> 01:14:00,580
And I can get Meg!

1896
01:14:01,540 --> 01:14:03,380
Why is Chris the most expensive?

1897
01:14:06,280 --> 01:14:07,040
Why is...

1898
01:14:07,040 --> 01:14:11,240
Why the fuck is Chris Griffin so fucking expensive compared to everybody?

1899
01:14:11,800 --> 01:14:12,840
Is it because...

1900
01:14:12,840 --> 01:14:15,040
Is it because Seth Green does NFTs?

1901
01:14:16,280 --> 01:14:17,520
I'm a little confused.

1902
01:14:17,580 --> 01:14:19,560
It says that you can buy a pier so...

1903
01:14:19,560 --> 01:14:20,760
So, like a cover.

1904
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:22,600
So rain and thunder won't kill you.

1905
01:14:22,820 --> 01:14:23,620
Oh, yeah.

1906
01:14:23,960 --> 01:14:25,780
Yeah, that's what happened to me.

1907
01:14:26,720 --> 01:14:29,040
I like how someone's like, Chris is endgame.

1908
01:14:31,340 --> 01:14:32,680
Oh yeah, Chris Griffin?

1909
01:14:32,820 --> 01:14:33,680
Yeah, that's kinda endgame.

1910
01:14:33,860 --> 01:14:35,280
Yeah, that's endgink.

1911
01:14:37,820 --> 01:14:38,300
Oh!

1912
01:14:38,540 --> 01:14:40,740
Meg drives off Burglar because she's ugly!

1913
01:14:41,840 --> 01:14:42,980
Is this Quagmire?

1914
01:14:43,120 --> 01:14:43,820
Why is he a toilet?

1915
01:14:44,140 --> 01:14:44,800
Is he a toilet?

1916
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:45,600
Oh no.

1917
01:14:46,120 --> 01:14:47,000
Oh, the chicken!

1918
01:14:47,340 --> 01:14:49,160
Oh my god, we're making so much money!

1919
01:14:50,420 --> 01:14:50,900
Okay.

1920
01:14:50,900 --> 01:14:51,600
Okay.

1921
01:14:51,880 --> 01:14:54,320
He occasionally turns into a toilet.

1922
01:14:54,420 --> 01:14:56,320
Gives two times money while toilet.

1923
01:14:56,560 --> 01:14:57,580
Oh, he gives more money!

1924
01:14:58,100 --> 01:15:01,320
Wait, does that mean if I click him, he gives me money?

1925
01:15:01,580 --> 01:15:02,880
No, it's like automatic.

1926
01:15:03,100 --> 01:15:04,000
No, it's for Peter.

1927
01:15:04,020 --> 01:15:05,220
Yeah, it's like a Peter buff.

1928
01:15:05,540 --> 01:15:06,720
I mean a Peter buff.

1929
01:15:06,980 --> 01:15:10,840
So like, if Peter sits on the Quagmire toilet, we get money.

1930
01:15:11,180 --> 01:15:12,580
Yeah, he gets extra milk.

1931
01:15:12,580 --> 01:15:13,440
Okay, we need to get endgame.

1932
01:15:13,500 --> 01:15:14,280
We need 5k.

1933
01:15:14,940 --> 01:15:15,820
Or 7k.

1934
01:15:15,980 --> 01:15:16,680
5k for endgame?

1935
01:15:16,740 --> 01:15:17,880
We gotta all click on Peter.

1936
01:15:18,120 --> 01:15:20,640
I bought a fishing rod, but I can't use it.

1937
01:15:20,640 --> 01:15:21,560
You haven't?

1938
01:15:21,580 --> 01:15:23,320
No, I have nothing in my...

1939
01:15:23,320 --> 01:15:24,320
Do you know where the pier is?

1940
01:15:24,540 --> 01:15:26,140
Maybe it automatically...

1941
01:15:26,140 --> 01:15:26,880
Oh, maybe.

1942
01:15:27,180 --> 01:15:29,320
Yeah, maybe I gotta look for more interactions or something.

1943
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:33,620
You go over to the... You go over and fish.

1944
01:15:33,740 --> 01:15:34,460
I'm gonna try it.

1945
01:15:35,900 --> 01:15:36,380
Snuffy?

1946
01:15:37,880 --> 01:15:38,600
Did you?

1947
01:15:48,040 --> 01:15:49,840
You saw him, didn't you?

1948
01:15:51,380 --> 01:15:52,900
I saw him.

1949
01:15:52,960 --> 01:15:53,780
I saw him.

1950
01:15:56,080 --> 01:15:59,280
I'm trying to feed outside and I saw him.

1951
01:16:04,420 --> 01:16:06,980
I'm not sure if it was real or not.

1952
01:16:07,720 --> 01:16:08,280
Alright.

1953
01:16:08,500 --> 01:16:10,240
I'm trying to get...

1954
01:16:10,240 --> 01:16:12,940
drinks, coffee for a short speed boost.

1955
01:16:13,060 --> 01:16:14,560
What do you need speed boost for?

1956
01:16:14,620 --> 01:16:16,640
Can boost your money up to four times?

1957
01:16:16,780 --> 01:16:17,780

01:16:18,040 --> 01:16:20,260

1962
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:24,400

1966
01:16:29,020 --> 01:16:30,340

01:16:30,760 --> 01:16:31,920
Give me all your money.

1968
01:16:32,020 --> 01:16:32,420
I don't know if there's an end game.

1969
01:16:32,560 --> 01:16:34,660
I think it's like a forever type of thing.

1970
01:16:34,740 --> 01:16:35,500
There's no way!

1971
01:16:35,820 --> 01:16:36,100

1974
01:16:40,100 --> 01:16:41,700
You know that Kim Kardashian game?

1975
01:16:42,160 --> 01:16:43,520

1976
01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:45,820

1977
01:16:45,820 --> 01:16:48,360

1979
01:16:49,500 --> 01:16:52,280

1981
01:16:53,980 --> 01:16:56,840

1982
01:16:57,100 --> 01:16:58,780
You're getting assaulted by a ghost?

1983
01:16:58,780 --> 01:17:00,800

1986
01:17:07,240 --> 01:17:07,960
I can't go outside or the thunder is gonna get me!

1987
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:10,880
It's only attacking me during the...

1988
01:17:10,880 --> 01:17:13,280
If I'm close to the fish pool...

1989
01:17:13,280 --> 01:17:14,060
It says like...

1990
01:17:14,060 --> 01:17:15,800

I start getting like attacked.

1995
01:17:25,700 --> 01:17:27,740
He's immune to ghosts.

1996
01:17:28,020 --> 01:17:28,680
It says like...

1997
01:17:28,680 --> 01:17:29,260

2071

2072
01:20:02,140 --> 01:20:04,040

Mine was $90 robux.

2074
01:20:06,460 --> 01:20:09,460
Actually I got this from the live Lil Nas Roblox.

2075
01:20:09,660 --> 01:20:11,480
Actually I got this from the live Lil Nas Roblox.

2076
01:20:11,480 --> 01:20:13,120
I got this from the live Lil Nas Roblox concert.

2077
01:20:13,980 --> 01:20:17,900
I don't know if it was like 21 pilots of like...

2078
01:20:17,900 --> 01:20:18,640
I don't know if it was like 21 pilots of like...

2079
01:20:18,640 --> 01:20:19,600
Nojacat or something.

2080
01:20:19,720 --> 01:20:21,760
I think it was Nicki Minaj.

2081
01:20:21,900 --> 01:20:24,000
Nicki Minaj has like Pussy World.

2082
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,300
Nicki Minaj has like Pussy World.

2083
01:20:28,820 --> 01:20:29,400
Okay.

2084
01:20:29,700 --> 01:20:31,780
It's like the Nicki Minaj Pussy World.

2085
01:20:31,940 --> 01:20:32,620
They actually...

2086
01:20:32,620 --> 01:20:36,940
Okay doggie this might be a little on the point here.

2087
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:37,180
Okay doggie this might be a little on the point here.

2088
01:20:37,340 --> 01:20:41,060
There was a world that was actually an official roblox sponsor.

2089
01:20:41,060 --> 01:20:45,520
But it was removed because it was still a little bit adult to them.

2090
01:20:45,620 --> 01:20:46,660
But it was removed because it was still a little bit adult to them.

2091
01:20:46,660 --> 01:20:48,200
But it was basically like a woman's...

2092
01:20:48,200 --> 01:20:49,460
What to call this?

2093
01:20:49,560 --> 01:20:51,440
A woman's menstrual...

2094
01:20:52,820 --> 01:20:53,780
Informational world.

2095
01:20:53,860 --> 01:20:54,100
What?

2096
01:20:54,920 --> 01:20:58,360
You can change your character model to like a woman's tampon.

2097
01:20:58,360 --> 01:20:58,520
You can change your character model to like a woman's tampon.

2098
01:20:58,520 --> 01:21:00,980
And like go down the tubes.

2099
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:03,560
And all those pieces parts.

2100
01:21:03,900 --> 01:21:04,300
What?

2101
01:21:04,340 --> 01:21:07,160
And get a whole like informational...

2102
01:21:07,160 --> 01:21:09,040
Practically think of it as like a...

2103
01:21:09,040 --> 01:21:10,580
Magic school bus.

2104
01:21:11,060 --> 01:21:13,200
Where like you shrink down and get to experience like...

2105
01:21:13,200 --> 01:21:14,780
The parts of a woman.

2106
01:21:14,960 --> 01:21:16,000
In roblox.

2107
01:21:16,260 --> 01:21:19,400
How did you know about this?

2108
01:21:19,520 --> 01:21:21,020
Did you go there?

2109
01:21:21,340 --> 01:21:23,140
Did you visit this world?

2110
01:21:23,320 --> 01:21:24,060
I just didn't.

2111
01:21:24,060 --> 01:21:26,760
But it got fucking removed for being too mature.

2112
01:21:26,760 --> 01:21:30,600
Was this your like daily world you visit every day?

2113
01:21:31,080 --> 01:21:31,660
Was this your like daily world you visit every day?

2114
01:21:31,660 --> 01:21:36,140
Today let's time to visit the menstrual world on roblox.

2115
01:21:36,340 --> 01:21:39,300
I just really like to be a tampon one day.

2116
01:21:39,780 --> 01:21:41,040
I just really like to be a tampon one day.

2117
01:21:41,060 --> 01:21:41,260
Oh my god.

2118
01:21:43,500 --> 01:21:46,140
I wish it still lived to this day.

2119
01:21:46,220 --> 01:21:50,980
But I definitely think there might be like a youtube video that goes in depth on like how cursed it is.

2120
01:21:52,140 --> 01:21:54,560
You can like roleplay being like...

2121
01:21:54,560 --> 01:21:55,120
Let me see.

2122
01:21:55,160 --> 01:21:55,460
Hold on.

2123
01:21:55,540 --> 01:21:58,020
Let me see if I can send you something in google that shows it.

2124
01:21:58,240 --> 01:22:00,600
The sex update went through on roblox?

2125
01:22:01,840 --> 01:22:02,900
Is that true?

2126
01:22:04,520 --> 01:22:06,840
Is that... Is that true?

2127
01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:09,700
No no.

2128
01:22:09,700 --> 01:22:12,540
Are there 18 plus servers now on roblox?

2129
01:22:12,540 --> 01:22:12,880
Oh my god.

2130
01:22:12,980 --> 01:22:14,500
It was called the V land.

2131
01:22:14,880 --> 01:22:16,040
The V land?

2132
01:22:22,510 --> 01:22:23,650
I don't even know.

2133
01:22:23,650 --> 01:22:27,810
I don't know if it's the real one but this is what it looked like.

2134
01:22:28,010 --> 01:22:28,630
V land.

2135
01:22:28,870 --> 01:22:31,010
Where you get to dress up as like a tampon.

2136
01:22:32,310 --> 01:22:33,690
I go to the menstrual...

2137
01:22:36,130 --> 01:22:37,010
Hold on.

2138
01:22:37,390 --> 01:22:40,310
I'm gonna save this and put it on stream so you can see.

2139
01:22:40,390 --> 01:22:40,570
You're gonna save?

2140
01:22:41,550 --> 01:22:43,290
Oh my god.

2141
01:22:45,670 --> 01:22:48,090
What am I looking at?

2142
01:22:49,310 --> 01:22:49,470
What am I looking at?

2143
01:22:49,470 --> 01:22:50,010
What am I looking at?

2144
01:22:50,250 --> 01:22:50,370
What?

2145
01:22:52,350 --> 01:22:54,310
Oh my god.

2146
01:22:54,570 --> 01:22:55,490
This is...

2147
01:22:55,490 --> 01:22:56,690
Oh my...

2148
01:22:57,330 --> 01:22:59,330
Now I know why they shut it down.

2149
01:23:00,550 --> 01:23:02,530
Now I know why they shut it down.

2150
01:23:02,610 --> 01:23:04,770
I love women.

2151
01:23:04,870 --> 01:23:05,190
I love women.

2152
01:23:05,570 --> 01:23:07,050
Now I know.

2153
01:23:07,070 --> 01:23:09,430
I like these like thumbnails from youtube.

2154
01:23:09,530 --> 01:23:11,410
That if you search like roblox v land.

2155
01:23:11,550 --> 01:23:14,370
You just get these relics of like what could this possibly be?

2156
01:23:14,370 --> 01:23:14,790
You guys.

2157
01:23:14,910 --> 01:23:15,670
If my mod.

2158
01:23:16,110 --> 01:23:17,490
Don't link it in chat.

2159
01:23:18,110 --> 01:23:19,390
Don't link it.

2160
01:23:19,590 --> 01:23:22,010
If you don't link it in chat.

2161
01:23:22,110 --> 01:23:24,730
Let the chat discover it themselves.

2162
01:23:25,710 --> 01:23:28,350
Let them discover it themselves.

2163
01:23:28,350 --> 01:23:28,810
Oh my god.

2164
01:23:28,810 --> 01:23:30,070
Wolf this is so good.

2165
01:23:30,170 --> 01:23:32,150
I gotta save this picture.

2166
01:23:32,190 --> 01:23:33,030
This is so good.

2167
01:23:33,130 --> 01:23:36,570
I wanna make this like my fucking collab just chatting picture.

2168
01:23:36,830 --> 01:23:37,130
Yeah.

2169
01:23:37,130 --> 01:23:37,790
Oh my god.

2170
01:23:42,820 --> 01:23:44,660
It's so fucking big.

2171
01:23:44,980 --> 01:23:45,980
Wolf is not a real thing.

2172
01:23:46,280 --> 01:23:46,920
What?

2173
01:23:47,200 --> 01:23:47,720
It is.

2174
01:23:47,720 --> 01:23:49,340
That was 100% a real thing.

2175
01:23:49,420 --> 01:23:50,360
That was very real.

2176
01:23:50,540 --> 01:23:55,000
It's just another roblox classic moment.

2177
01:23:55,980 --> 01:23:56,620
Like...

2178
01:23:57,840 --> 01:23:58,780
I will...

2179
01:24:00,780 --> 01:24:03,260
I don't even have any words.

2180
01:24:04,180 --> 01:24:06,320
To describe how I feel.

2181
01:24:06,460 --> 01:24:07,840
Learning about this.

2182
01:24:08,540 --> 01:24:09,060
To describe how I feel learning about this.

2183
01:24:10,380 --> 01:24:14,280
Oh my god, there's like... I can't... I can't commentate.

2184
01:24:14,580 --> 01:24:19,580
I can't even commentate on this.

2185
01:24:19,720 --> 01:24:20,120
Like what?

2186
01:24:20,680 --> 01:24:24,540
Like this is like beyond my pay grade.

2187
01:24:27,620 --> 01:24:30,240
The game is still up?

2188
01:24:32,360 --> 01:24:35,040
The game still exists?

2189
01:24:35,140 --> 01:24:37,260
I thought it got taken down!

2190
01:24:38,500 --> 01:24:41,280
What do you mean it's still around?

2191
01:24:41,820 --> 01:24:45,080
I've been raising my Peter this entire time!

2192
01:24:45,380 --> 01:24:46,820
I'm gonna end this game.

2193
01:24:46,980 --> 01:24:51,720
I'm gonna end this game.

2194
01:24:55,880 --> 01:24:58,160
It has gone too far.

2195
01:25:00,080 --> 01:25:01,020
I am ready.

2196
01:25:02,460 --> 01:25:05,640
I'm ready to buy this mysterious burger.

2197
01:25:07,580 --> 01:25:08,620
I'm gonna pay for it.

2198
01:25:08,700 --> 01:25:09,080
Hello?

2199
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:10,520
Oh there you go.

2200
01:25:10,780 --> 01:25:11,660
Five thousand!

2201
01:25:11,860 --> 01:25:13,640
Oh wait, I can... five thousand dollars is not bad.

2202
01:25:13,980 --> 01:25:15,200
Okay, I gotta throw this away.

2203
01:25:16,440 --> 01:25:19,100
We're not playing V-Land!

2204
01:25:20,860 --> 01:25:23,300
We're not playing V-Land, guys!

2205
01:25:26,280 --> 01:25:27,240
We're not!

2206
01:25:27,480 --> 01:25:32,240
There's no... there's no world where I'm gonna fucking play V-Land!

2207
01:25:34,120 --> 01:25:35,900
Oh my god, we need to fucking...

2208
01:25:35,900 --> 01:25:38,120
Grab 5k so I can end this.

2209
01:25:38,520 --> 01:25:39,120
Wait...

2210
01:25:40,900 --> 01:25:43,340
Peter... Peter, give me 5k!

2211
01:25:43,880 --> 01:25:48,160
I can't keep going on after learning about V-Land.

2212
01:25:49,920 --> 01:25:51,060
We're so close.

2213
01:25:51,920 --> 01:25:53,780
We're so close to 5k.

2214
01:25:55,160 --> 01:25:56,460
We're almost there.

2215
01:25:57,380 --> 01:26:03,320
Wait, I don't need to learn more about women because women aren't real!

2216
01:26:03,320 --> 01:26:06,040
We had this conversation chat!

2217
01:26:06,480 --> 01:26:08,080
Women were never real!

2218
01:26:08,520 --> 01:26:09,920
Not on the internet!

2219
01:26:11,240 --> 01:26:12,820
Alright, it's time.

2220
01:26:13,440 --> 01:26:15,460
It's time to end this.

2221
01:26:19,560 --> 01:26:21,960
Alright, I got the mysterious burger.

2222
01:26:22,640 --> 01:26:23,980
I have the money.

2223
01:26:25,660 --> 01:26:26,800
This is it.

2224
01:26:27,520 --> 01:26:28,900
We're gonna kill Peter.

2225
01:26:32,230 --> 01:26:33,750
Peter, I'm coming over.

2226
01:26:35,190 --> 01:26:36,670
This is gonna end now.

2227
01:26:38,850 --> 01:26:39,690
Where is he?

2228
01:26:39,750 --> 01:26:40,690
How do I feed him this?

2229
01:26:41,630 --> 01:26:42,850
Peter, eat this burger.

2230
01:26:43,770 --> 01:26:44,390
Wait, do I?

2231
01:26:45,170 --> 01:26:45,650
Open.

2232
01:26:47,610 --> 01:26:49,910
Oh, he'll eat it when he gets there!

2233
01:26:50,250 --> 01:26:50,730
Alright.

2234
01:26:54,390 --> 01:26:55,270
Okay, we're good.

2235
01:26:55,430 --> 01:26:56,690
It's just a waiting game.

2236
01:26:57,310 --> 01:26:59,050
And then we'll kill Peter.

2237
01:26:59,230 --> 01:26:59,610
Okay, okay.

2238
01:26:59,870 --> 01:27:00,550
I'm back.

2239
01:27:00,850 --> 01:27:02,170
Welcome back, Snuffy.

2240
01:27:02,530 --> 01:27:04,810
Snuffy, I have end game ready.

2241
01:27:05,330 --> 01:27:06,090
Oh shit!

2242
01:27:06,250 --> 01:27:08,810
We got Griffin's son, number two.

2243
01:27:08,950 --> 01:27:10,070
Number one, I guess.

2244
01:27:11,010 --> 01:27:14,330
Chris has been here for like ten minutes now, Snuffy.

2245
01:27:15,370 --> 01:27:16,590
What is he for?

2246
01:27:17,890 --> 01:27:19,270
Chris has been here for...

2247
01:27:19,270 --> 01:27:22,050
He's the one that's been turning on the speaker on and off!

2248
01:27:24,090 --> 01:27:25,410
I thought that was you!

2249
01:27:25,610 --> 01:27:26,150
I thought you were...

2250
01:27:26,150 --> 01:27:26,750
Dude, pizza?

2251
01:27:26,910 --> 01:27:27,730
Is this end game?

2252
01:27:28,090 --> 01:27:29,030
No, no, no, no.

2253
01:27:29,110 --> 01:27:29,750
Look, look, look.

2254
01:27:29,870 --> 01:27:32,630
I got the mysterious green burger.

2255
01:27:33,950 --> 01:27:34,510
This is it.

2256
01:27:34,510 --> 01:27:36,030
Oh, the mysterious green burger?

2257
01:27:36,150 --> 01:27:37,330
The nasty patty?

2258
01:27:37,410 --> 01:27:38,150
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2259
01:27:38,170 --> 01:27:39,190
The nasty patty.

2260
01:27:39,250 --> 01:27:41,410
Have you seen like modern SpongeBob now?

2261
01:27:43,030 --> 01:27:43,990
Modern Spon...

2262
01:27:44,550 --> 01:27:47,690
SpongeBob is still going on.

2263
01:27:49,490 --> 01:27:50,510
It's so fucking...

2264
01:27:50,510 --> 01:27:50,970
Yeah.

2265
01:27:52,750 --> 01:27:53,710
I'm like scared.

2266
01:27:53,790 --> 01:27:56,470
I would rather watch like one of those like horrendous...

2267
01:27:56,470 --> 01:27:59,250
Have you ever seen like that one adult swim show like Mr. Pickles?

2268
01:27:59,730 --> 01:28:02,470
I would rather watch that than like modern SpongeBob.

2269
01:28:02,470 --> 01:28:06,730
I was like, what the fuck is this shit?

2270
01:28:07,110 --> 01:28:12,690
It was like the only thing like on at 3 in the morning and I used to like click on it and I would be like...

2271
01:28:12,690 --> 01:28:13,290
You watch Mr. Pickles.

2272
01:28:13,290 --> 01:28:15,570
You unironically watch Mr. Pickles.

2273
01:28:16,030 --> 01:28:18,870
And I would start playing and then I would just be like jaw agape the whole time.

2274
01:28:18,990 --> 01:28:21,410
I would be like 13 and just being like, what?

2275
01:28:22,490 --> 01:28:23,610
It's so fucked up.

2276
01:28:23,690 --> 01:28:24,350
It's so gross.

2277
01:28:24,970 --> 01:28:26,790
There's so much money in our house.

2278
01:28:26,850 --> 01:28:27,010
Wow.

2279
01:28:27,070 --> 01:28:28,590
Wait, Peter ate the green burger.

2280
01:28:28,830 --> 01:28:29,770
But he's still like...

2281
01:28:29,770 --> 01:28:30,190
Wait, what happened?

2282
01:28:30,650 --> 01:28:31,610
He ate it.

2283
01:28:31,730 --> 01:28:32,010
Oh, I'm so sorry.

2284
01:28:32,070 --> 01:28:32,870
What happened?

2285
01:28:32,910 --> 01:28:33,710
Oh, wait, what?

2286
01:28:33,810 --> 01:28:34,550
Wait, did he glow?

2287
01:28:34,910 --> 01:28:35,310
Okay.

2288
01:28:35,730 --> 01:28:36,130
No.

2289
01:28:36,190 --> 01:28:37,790
No, he just like pooped out of cash.

2290
01:28:37,910 --> 01:28:38,390
That's it.

2291
01:28:38,730 --> 01:28:39,130
What?

2292
01:28:39,310 --> 01:28:40,510
It said ending.

2293
01:28:41,190 --> 01:28:42,890
It said ending.

2294
01:28:43,830 --> 01:28:44,950
Where's the ending?

2295
01:28:46,050 --> 01:28:47,090
I got scammed.

2296
01:28:47,150 --> 01:28:49,350
I paid $5,000 for this.

2297
01:28:50,170 --> 01:28:51,470
$5,000?

2298
01:28:51,630 --> 01:28:52,170
Wait, what?

2299
01:28:52,230 --> 01:28:53,690
We have 66 feathers.

2300
01:28:53,870 --> 01:28:54,810
What does that even mean?

2301
01:28:54,930 --> 01:28:55,690
Oh, I bought a store.

2302
01:28:55,950 --> 01:28:59,910
Apparently, there's like a chicken coop and then you like buy stuff at the chicken coop.

2303
01:29:01,090 --> 01:29:01,430
Aww.

2304
01:29:01,430 --> 01:29:02,150
Why is he still alive?

2305
01:29:03,010 --> 01:29:05,290
Oh, is this right next to our house?

2306
01:29:05,430 --> 01:29:06,090
Wait, there's some...

2307
01:29:06,090 --> 01:29:06,210
Cave.

2308
01:29:06,410 --> 01:29:07,470
No, that's a cave.

2309
01:29:07,590 --> 01:29:08,370
Chicken coop upgrade.

2310
01:29:08,630 --> 01:29:09,470
Where's the chicken coop?

2311
01:29:09,470 --> 01:29:09,750
Scares.

2312
01:29:10,210 --> 01:29:11,170
Wait, where is it?

2313
01:29:11,370 --> 01:29:12,470
Oh, there it is.

2314
01:29:13,690 --> 01:29:15,190
There is no ending?

2315
01:29:16,370 --> 01:29:16,850
Okay.

2316
01:29:17,250 --> 01:29:20,650
It's a forever... Peter is like a... it's a commitment.

2317
01:29:20,850 --> 01:29:20,870
Scares.

2318
01:29:20,870 --> 01:29:23,930
Make Ernie punch 0.2 times faster.

2319
01:29:23,970 --> 01:29:28,470
Make Ernie punch... make Ernie punch... everything just makes him punch faster.

2320
01:29:28,870 --> 01:29:29,350
Like...

2321
01:29:31,430 --> 01:29:32,790
It just says make him punch.

2322
01:29:32,870 --> 01:29:33,230
I'm stuck.

2323
01:29:33,990 --> 01:29:35,310
There's a cave over here.

2324
01:29:36,250 --> 01:29:37,610
I see I found the cave.

2325
01:29:37,630 --> 01:29:38,310
I see I found the cave.

2326
01:29:38,450 --> 01:29:39,190
What's inside?

2327
01:29:39,310 --> 01:29:39,890
Too bad it's blocked.

2328
01:29:40,010 --> 01:29:42,170
Get rid of the vines and you need to fill up the gasoline meter.

2329
01:29:42,430 --> 01:29:44,970
To fill up the meter, you have to purchase gasoline tanks.

2330
01:29:45,330 --> 01:29:48,170
Once you fill up the meter, you use a match to light up the vines.

2331
01:29:48,330 --> 01:29:49,390
Now just sit back.

2332
01:29:49,550 --> 01:29:51,870
Once the cave is open, grab... Oh my god.

2333
01:29:51,950 --> 01:29:53,030
What is this game?

2334
01:29:53,790 --> 01:29:55,010
What did you get?

2335
01:29:55,610 --> 01:29:56,330
I'm stuck.

2336
01:29:57,430 --> 01:29:59,390
I can't stop the game.

2337
01:29:59,390 --> 01:29:59,990
I can't even...

2338
01:30:00,930 --> 01:30:02,830
Snuffy, I can't even get out.

2339
01:30:03,050 --> 01:30:03,610
Wait, what?

2340
01:30:03,870 --> 01:30:04,750
Wait, what's happening?

2341
01:30:04,890 --> 01:30:05,410
Is this the ending?

2342
01:30:05,550 --> 01:30:07,210
Did we... did we beat the game?

2343
01:30:07,490 --> 01:30:08,690
Oh my god.

2344
01:30:09,310 --> 01:30:11,350
Wait, what's going... what the fuck?

2345
01:30:11,610 --> 01:30:12,710
What the...

2346
01:30:12,710 --> 01:30:14,810
He dragged from the Garfield Cup!

2347
01:30:18,560 --> 01:30:19,500
Oh, he's dead.

2348
01:30:22,720 --> 01:30:24,440
I think I forgot to take...

2349
01:30:24,440 --> 01:30:25,180
He got the theory!

2350
01:30:25,460 --> 01:30:27,140
It's the Garfield Cup!

2351
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:28,480
Oh!

2352
01:30:36,350 --> 01:30:37,630
Oh my god!

2353
01:30:38,870 --> 01:30:42,390
It's the fucking Gar... I was kicked from the experience!

2354
01:30:45,190 --> 01:30:46,330
Oh my god!

2355
01:30:46,610 --> 01:30:48,230
It was the Gar...

2356
01:30:51,040 --> 01:30:53,260
He gave him the Garfield Cup!

2357
01:30:53,520 --> 01:30:56,100
Here comes full circle chat.

2358
01:30:59,160 --> 01:31:00,140
Oh my god.

2359
01:31:00,160 --> 01:31:01,340
I can't believe it.

2360
01:31:01,460 --> 01:31:01,900
You wanna... okay.

2361
01:31:02,220 --> 01:31:03,580
You wanna try a different one?

2362
01:31:03,620 --> 01:31:04,440
Let's try a different one.

2363
01:31:04,600 --> 01:31:05,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2364
01:31:05,840 --> 01:31:06,560
We're good.

2365
01:31:06,760 --> 01:31:08,960
Let's try another Roblox game.

2366
01:31:09,500 --> 01:31:10,660
Oh my goodness.

2367
01:31:10,880 --> 01:31:11,140
Okay.

2368
01:31:11,180 --> 01:31:11,940
I can't believe it.

2369
01:31:12,300 --> 01:31:14,200
Classic Garfield Cup was real.

2370
01:31:14,360 --> 01:31:16,520
It was actually real.

2371
01:31:19,680 --> 01:31:20,480
Okay, okay.

2372
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:21,700
Let's see.

2373
01:31:21,840 --> 01:31:23,900
What... what kind of game are you feeling now?

2374
01:31:24,020 --> 01:31:25,180
That was a good, like...

2375
01:31:25,180 --> 01:31:28,380
Get the... get the blood pumping, right?

2376
01:31:29,040 --> 01:31:30,080
Yeah, that was a great one.

2377
01:31:30,320 --> 01:31:32,040
I can't believe we killed Peter.

2378
01:31:32,540 --> 01:31:36,460
There's... you can have a hundred players in a fucking Peter lobby?

2379
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:38,220
Oh my god.

2380
01:31:38,300 --> 01:31:42,600
How do you stop, like, a hundred people from not feeding him the uranium burger?

2381
01:31:43,040 --> 01:31:44,580
Like, how do you stop?

2382
01:31:47,240 --> 01:31:52,560
I feel like I'll just go straight to wanting to, like, ruin people's games with the uranium burger.

2383
01:31:52,580 --> 01:31:56,060
You just go into, like, public lobbies and buy the uranium burger.

2384
01:32:00,320 --> 01:32:02,080
I'll fuck Bob, but...

2385
01:32:03,940 --> 01:32:06,740
So you said you've already been to, like, the hospital room?

2386
01:32:06,740 --> 01:32:12,320
I've done the hospital RP, I've done Dora's, and I've done Warrior Cat's roleplay.

2387
01:32:12,440 --> 01:32:15,520
But I'm down to go back to the Warrior Cat's roleplay.

2388
01:32:15,520 --> 01:32:17,340
You want to go back to the Warrior Cat?

2389
01:32:18,460 --> 01:32:24,660
Have you ever... have you ever turned... like, what I like to do is I like to ask my friends to turn their VTuber self into a Warrior Cat.

2390
01:32:24,860 --> 01:32:25,980
Into a Warrior Cat?

2391
01:32:26,080 --> 01:32:32,160
Oh, not like... not my... not my VTuber self, but I've done it as a kid multiple times.

2392
01:32:32,660 --> 01:32:33,360
Oh, you got it.

2393
01:32:33,460 --> 01:32:34,540
Okay, this one's a good one.

2394
01:32:34,600 --> 01:32:35,260
Did you do this one?

2395
01:32:35,360 --> 01:32:36,400
This one's my favorite one.

2396
01:32:36,400 --> 01:32:36,820
Which one?

2397
01:32:36,820 --> 01:32:37,300
Is it official?

2398
01:32:37,540 --> 01:32:38,700
Because they have official ones now.

2399
01:32:38,920 --> 01:32:39,980
They have an official one?

2400
01:32:40,080 --> 01:32:40,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2401
01:32:40,520 --> 01:32:41,360
I don't know if this is official.

2402
01:32:41,360 --> 01:32:41,720
It is!

2403
01:32:41,720 --> 01:32:42,860
My Warrior Cat's RP!

2404
01:32:43,600 --> 01:32:47,360
Create your own in the official game based on Warriors.

2405
01:32:47,580 --> 01:32:48,160
Yeah, this is!

2406
01:32:48,360 --> 01:32:48,940
This is official!

2407
01:32:49,560 --> 01:32:50,360
This is the one?

2408
01:32:50,580 --> 01:32:51,620
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2409
01:32:51,640 --> 01:32:52,320
Oh, nice, nice, nice.

2410
01:32:52,500 --> 01:32:53,160
It's really good.

2411
01:32:54,340 --> 01:32:54,700
Alright.

2412
01:32:55,340 --> 01:32:56,580
This is when we boot it up.

2413
01:32:56,740 --> 01:32:59,280
Wait, how many times have you played the official?

2414
01:32:59,380 --> 01:33:00,260
I've only played it once.

2415
01:33:00,740 --> 01:33:01,900
I've only done it one time.

2416
01:33:02,040 --> 01:33:02,400
How many times have you played?

2417
01:33:02,400 --> 01:33:03,480
Yeah, I've done this one time.

2418
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,300
I don't know, it seems like you were pretty experienced just now.

2419
01:33:06,300 --> 01:33:08,300
There's bunches of them, that's why.

2420
01:33:08,460 --> 01:33:11,840
I played a couple of them, but this one I've only played one time.

2421
01:33:12,260 --> 01:33:12,360
Oh.

2422
01:33:12,900 --> 01:33:15,100
How do you know it's good if you only played it once?

2423
01:33:16,040 --> 01:33:17,500
Because that was just that phenomenon.

2424
01:33:20,620 --> 01:33:21,060
Alright.

2425
01:33:21,420 --> 01:33:25,580
Apparently I actually have to install Roblox for the- this is how elaborate it is.

2426
01:33:25,680 --> 01:33:28,020
You didn't even have them for the other- No, I didn't!

2427
01:33:28,020 --> 01:33:29,000
I didn't have to!

2428
01:33:29,180 --> 01:33:33,800
I actually have to install Roblox for the Warrior Cat's Roleplay.

2429
01:33:34,840 --> 01:33:35,280
Alright.

2430
01:33:35,420 --> 01:33:36,160
Warrior Cat.

2431
01:33:36,300 --> 01:33:37,840
Okay, let's see.

2432
01:33:38,480 --> 01:33:39,900
Uh, join friends.

2433
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:41,500
Alright.

2434
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:43,400
Wait, what server are you in?

2435
01:33:43,620 --> 01:33:43,960
Oh.

2436
01:33:44,460 --> 01:33:46,160
That's you, I see you, you're the cat!

2437
01:33:46,460 --> 01:33:46,560
Yeah!

2438
01:33:46,740 --> 01:33:47,480
I'm a cat!

2439
01:33:47,960 --> 01:33:49,380
You're made for this!

2440
01:33:50,660 --> 01:33:53,600
Oh my god, the icon is like, two cats in love.

2441
01:33:54,860 --> 01:33:56,400
Two cats in love.

2442
01:33:56,700 --> 01:33:57,660
Alright, settings.

2443
01:33:58,120 --> 01:33:59,320
What the fuck is this?

2444
01:33:59,560 --> 01:34:01,760
Show display name next to roleplay name.

2445
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,980
Show- use roleplay name in chatbox if chat has roleplay.

2446
01:34:05,280 --> 01:34:05,440
Oh.

2447
01:34:05,440 --> 01:34:06,280
This will be a great play.

2448
01:34:06,300 --> 01:34:08,240
This is a great place for you to spend some Robux, I'm sure.

2449
01:34:08,280 --> 01:34:08,660
Okay.

2450
01:34:08,660 --> 01:34:08,960
Let's see.

2451
01:34:09,040 --> 01:34:10,420
Character editor, editing.

2452
01:34:10,760 --> 01:34:12,040
Oh my god, there's so many.

2453
01:34:12,160 --> 01:34:16,040
There's so many, like, what the fuck is this?

2454
01:34:16,400 --> 01:34:18,260
There's so many settings!

2455
01:34:18,720 --> 01:34:25,860
There's a warm filter, cool blue lights, dropped item, head turning, warning.

2456
01:34:26,160 --> 01:34:28,460
These settings will cause lag.

2457
01:34:28,900 --> 01:34:31,120
Wind line- okay, I'm gonna show this, guys.

2458
01:34:31,200 --> 01:34:32,260
This is actually crazy.

2459
01:34:33,300 --> 01:34:35,640
Look at the effective settings.

2460
01:34:35,640 --> 01:34:38,800
Wind line shake effects on mobile!

2461
01:34:39,160 --> 01:34:41,100
Who the fuck is roleplaying on mobile?

2462
01:34:41,560 --> 01:34:43,160
This is a full PC game.

2463
01:34:44,740 --> 01:34:48,240
Look at all these fucking settings for my Roblox RP.

2464
01:34:48,920 --> 01:34:52,040
Okay, now I'm gonna hide it because I don't know what it's gonna show.

2465
01:34:53,180 --> 01:34:53,740
Play.

2466
01:34:54,200 --> 01:34:55,740
It's pretty safe so far.

2467
01:34:56,220 --> 01:34:59,880
I think the main thing is that your username might show every so often.

2468
01:35:00,200 --> 01:35:00,240
Okay.

2469
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:02,840
Oh my god, it's character creation time.

2470
01:35:03,180 --> 01:35:05,420
Alright, welcome to the character creation.

2471
01:35:05,420 --> 01:35:08,260
This is where you can customize your cats with colors and accessories.

2472
01:35:08,660 --> 01:35:11,260
You can change your cat's color using the left panel.

2473
01:35:11,420 --> 01:35:13,940
You can use the paintbrush to color individuals?

2474
01:35:15,460 --> 01:35:17,580
You can use the slider to change the age.

2475
01:35:18,040 --> 01:35:18,980
I'm gonna be a kitten.

2476
01:35:19,280 --> 01:35:20,400
I'm gonna be a...

2477
01:35:20,400 --> 01:35:21,920
You mean a kit?

2478
01:35:21,980 --> 01:35:22,840
I'm gonna be a kit.

2479
01:35:23,060 --> 01:35:23,920
Yeah, a little kit.

2480
01:35:24,560 --> 01:35:26,160
I'm gonna be a doki kit.

2481
01:35:26,940 --> 01:35:29,840
Have you ever read Royale Cats?

2482
01:35:29,940 --> 01:35:30,860
Oh, 100%.

2483
01:35:30,860 --> 01:35:33,320
Until, like, it got way too convoluted.

2484
01:35:33,320 --> 01:35:39,620
I stopped when, like, you know, the three kits that had powers and stuff?

2485
01:35:39,780 --> 01:35:40,280
Chosen three?

2486
01:35:40,440 --> 01:35:41,160
Yeah, the chosen three.

2487
01:35:41,220 --> 01:35:42,720
And then one of them was a fake one.

2488
01:35:43,240 --> 01:35:45,040
And then they found out she's fake.

2489
01:35:45,100 --> 01:35:48,460
And then she ran into the cave because she got so fucking emo about it.

2490
01:35:48,640 --> 01:35:50,760
And then she fake died.

2491
01:35:52,180 --> 01:35:52,980
Oh my god.

2492
01:35:53,800 --> 01:35:55,120
You've just done most of it then.

2493
01:35:55,180 --> 01:35:56,340
At least most of the good stuff.

2494
01:35:56,420 --> 01:36:00,160
And then I stopped because I was like, what the fuck is going on?

2495
01:36:01,320 --> 01:36:02,780
So fucked up after that.

2496
01:36:03,320 --> 01:36:09,240
And then, like, I was so tired because Crowfeather was fucking every fucking cat that showed up.

2497
01:36:09,380 --> 01:36:09,900
So...

2498
01:36:11,480 --> 01:36:14,300
It started getting so wacky.

2499
01:36:14,300 --> 01:36:17,840
Yeah, and then, like, cats started, like, fucking every other cat.

2500
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,760
And then I lost track of which cat was fucking which cat.

2501
01:36:21,060 --> 01:36:22,620
And then I...

2502
01:36:23,320 --> 01:36:26,380
So I was so fucking confused at that point.

2503
01:36:26,440 --> 01:36:28,540
And then I stopped.

2504
01:36:34,500 --> 01:36:37,940
I just thought, you know, it just got too weird.

2505
01:36:38,120 --> 01:36:38,980
It just got too weird.

2506
01:36:39,060 --> 01:36:41,660
Crowfeather, like, banged, like, four different cats.

2507
01:36:41,880 --> 01:36:45,040
And I was just like, bro, what the fuck is going on?

2508
01:36:46,400 --> 01:36:48,180
Crowfeather is so fucked up.

2509
01:36:49,260 --> 01:36:53,100
Bro, he's like any cat that looks into his way and he's like, I'm in love.

2510
01:36:53,240 --> 01:36:54,260
I'm in love now.

2511
01:36:54,480 --> 01:36:55,880
And I'm just like, bro, fuck off.

2512
01:36:56,860 --> 01:36:57,940
I'm so starved.

2513
01:36:58,260 --> 01:37:02,580
And then, like, I'm like, what does this cat have that's, like, special?

2514
01:37:02,680 --> 01:37:03,300
And then, like, I'm like, what does this cat have that's, like, special?

2515
01:37:03,320 --> 01:37:04,300
He's like a little brat.

2516
01:37:04,540 --> 01:37:05,660
He's like a little bitch.

2517
01:37:09,020 --> 01:37:12,020
There's so many cats in this world.

2518
01:37:12,200 --> 01:37:16,800
What the fuck does Crowfetter has that like two medicine cats were like I'm in love.

2519
01:37:17,220 --> 01:37:18,480
I didn't see two medicine cats.

2520
01:37:18,600 --> 01:37:22,260
That's like pulling in like the hottest girls at school like the medicine cats there.

2521
01:37:22,280 --> 01:37:36,720
Yeah, because like the medicine cats are like it's like forbidden love because in war- okay for those who don't know It's like a clan thing so like there's like a cat that's like the doctor and like they're like super religious because the doctor- like they don't- they don't fuck.

2522
01:37:38,940 --> 01:37:42,180
It's like super forbidden for the medicine cat.

2523
01:37:42,260 --> 01:37:44,800
Yeah, they're like the- what are those girlies called?

2524
01:37:44,920 --> 01:37:45,180
A nun?

2525
01:37:45,380 --> 01:37:46,420
They're like cat nuns.

2526
01:37:46,420 --> 01:37:47,620
They're like cat nuns.

2527
01:37:47,620 --> 01:37:51,880
So like they're- like even the the guys who the cat priest too.

2528
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:58,100
They're not allowed to- they're not allowed to like have children or have like like mates or whatever.

2529
01:37:58,460 --> 01:38:19,060
So like the thing is there's this one cat that managed to get two different medicine cats to like fall in love with him and bang and I'm like what does he have and then after that He got two new cats to fall in love with him So it's like what the fuck does he just have a big dick like what's going on?

2530
01:38:19,780 --> 01:38:23,280
Is his scent like super like attractive?

2531
01:38:23,680 --> 01:38:30,240
I don't understand I don't understand Like does he have game?

2532
01:38:30,840 --> 01:38:31,440
Like...

2533
01:38:33,140 --> 01:38:36,740
How much thought you've put into like how attractive this cat is?

2534
01:38:36,900 --> 01:38:38,620
Like I'm like I don't understand!

2535
01:38:39,220 --> 01:38:42,140
Like why does this cat keep banging other cats?

2536
01:38:42,240 --> 01:38:43,080
So many cats!

2537
01:38:43,660 --> 01:38:51,980
And then like I stopped reading it because I was just like this is like I don't- I just really hate Crowfeather.

2538
01:38:52,180 --> 01:38:55,240
I really- I read Crowfeather so gross!

2539
01:38:55,680 --> 01:38:58,240
Crowfeather, I want to push him down the stairs.

2540
01:38:59,160 --> 01:39:00,020
My cat!

2541
01:39:00,040 --> 01:39:00,600
My cat!

2542
01:39:00,720 --> 01:39:03,040
I always wonder about warrior cats then I look at my cat.

2543
01:39:03,140 --> 01:39:07,680
And like I was going to the bathroom and she came into the bathroom with me and then she just started gnawing on the door stoppers.

2544
01:39:07,680 --> 01:39:09,900
He's like, I heard warrior cats.

2545
01:39:10,820 --> 01:39:11,620
I enjoy.

2546
01:39:13,060 --> 01:39:14,120

2550
01:39:19,620 --> 01:39:21,120

Okay, what are the paid ones?

01:43:11,380 --> 01:43:12,700
For that much money.

2663
01:43:12,780 --> 01:43:15,040
So like, you pay 300 to get like all of those items.

2664
01:43:15,320 --> 01:43:16,860
Alright, that's a lot better.

2665
01:43:17,080 --> 01:43:18,000
Yeah, that's pretty good.

2666
01:43:18,540 --> 01:43:18,940
Alright.

2667
01:43:19,140 --> 01:43:23,360
I'm just like, Wait, there's something for a 599 Robux.

2668
01:43:23,460 --> 01:43:24,060
I'm buying this.

2669
01:43:24,260 --> 01:43:24,600
Guys.

2670
01:43:25,440 --> 01:43:26,260
Give me a second.

2671
01:43:27,280 --> 01:43:27,800
Oh my god.

2672
01:43:28,580 --> 01:43:31,120
It's a fucking restock of Robux.

2673
01:43:31,260 --> 01:43:32,580
I should have never booted this.

2674
01:43:32,600 --> 01:43:33,400
It's limited balance bundle.

2675
01:43:34,120 --> 01:43:35,640
You don't understand.

2676
01:43:37,760 --> 01:43:39,000
Oh my god.

2677
01:43:39,160 --> 01:43:39,600
Oh my god.

2678
01:43:39,600 --> 01:43:40,100
Okay, guys.

2679
01:43:40,380 --> 01:43:41,100
Guys, look.

2680
01:43:41,620 --> 01:43:42,480
Look at this.

2681
01:43:42,800 --> 01:43:45,100
This was 599 Robux.

2682
01:43:49,220 --> 01:43:50,260
Oh no.

2683
01:43:51,220 --> 01:43:52,200
Oh my god.

2684
01:43:52,620 --> 01:43:53,860
I'm not...

2685
01:43:55,980 --> 01:43:56,340
Guys.

2686
01:43:56,540 --> 01:43:56,900
Guys.

2687
01:43:57,460 --> 01:43:59,740
Guys, it's worth it.

2688
01:43:59,800 --> 01:44:00,120
I don't know.

2689
01:44:00,120 --> 01:44:00,400
Oh my god.

2690
01:44:00,400 --> 01:44:01,040
Wait, did we get raided?

2691
01:44:01,160 --> 01:44:01,480
Oh my god.

2692
01:44:01,480 --> 01:44:02,680
I literally just brought my chat back.

2693
01:44:02,800 --> 01:44:03,840
I was like going crazy.

2694
01:44:03,900 --> 01:44:04,740
I was like, wait, where's my chat?

2695
01:44:04,780 --> 01:44:05,760
I thought I deleted it.

2696
01:44:06,280 --> 01:44:08,000
Dude, I'm so much for raid.

2697
01:44:08,040 --> 01:44:09,580
I'm gonna get the chin tough.

2698
01:44:09,760 --> 01:44:11,820
I'm gonna be like, um...

2699
01:44:12,760 --> 01:44:13,900
Oh my god.

2700
01:44:14,460 --> 01:44:14,820
Bro.

2701
01:44:16,820 --> 01:44:19,720
Bro, I'm gonna get all the ladies when I outgrow my kit phase.

2702
01:44:21,400 --> 01:44:22,120
When I...

2703
01:44:22,120 --> 01:44:24,660
When I pass my kit phase, guys.

2704
01:44:24,960 --> 01:44:26,540
I'm gonna get all the ladies.

2705
01:44:26,740 --> 01:44:27,700
Just you wait.

2706
01:44:28,560 --> 01:44:29,720
Just you wait.

2707
01:44:33,260 --> 01:44:33,820
Okay.

2708
01:44:34,200 --> 01:44:34,960
Let's see.

2709
01:44:35,640 --> 01:44:36,500
Oh, wait.

2710
01:44:36,660 --> 01:44:37,060
What's this?

2711
01:44:37,100 --> 01:44:37,620
Tail streak?

2712
01:44:38,120 --> 01:44:39,060
The tail.

2713
01:44:39,160 --> 01:44:39,960
The normal tail.

2714
01:44:40,340 --> 01:44:42,660
Oh, I wanna have like a plum...

2715
01:44:42,660 --> 01:44:43,800
A plum tail.

2716
01:44:44,560 --> 01:44:45,680
And then...

2717
01:44:47,100 --> 01:44:47,700
What's this?

2718
01:44:47,760 --> 01:44:48,100
Cuff.

2719
01:44:48,760 --> 01:44:49,460
Right cuff.

2720
01:44:49,460 --> 01:44:49,820
Okay, okay.

2721
01:44:50,060 --> 01:44:50,620
Sores.

2722
01:44:52,360 --> 01:44:53,720
There's vine wraps.

2723
01:44:53,800 --> 01:44:55,140
There's so many accessories!

2724
01:44:56,180 --> 01:44:57,900
Why is... I'm just buying them all.

2725
01:44:58,380 --> 01:44:59,560
There's so many!

2726
01:45:00,320 --> 01:45:01,500
This is how they get you.

2727
01:45:01,740 --> 01:45:02,920
This is how they get you.

2728
01:45:02,920 --> 01:45:03,360
It's how they get you.

2729
01:45:03,460 --> 01:45:04,660
It's totally...

2730
01:45:04,660 --> 01:45:07,600
You can make the decision yourself.

2731
01:45:07,780 --> 01:45:08,480
You're strong.

2732
01:45:08,600 --> 01:45:09,040
You're strong.

2733
01:45:09,060 --> 01:45:09,800
No, I'm not.

2734
01:45:09,920 --> 01:45:11,300
I wanna be like...

2735
01:45:11,300 --> 01:45:12,840
I wanna be Crowfeather.

2736
01:45:13,200 --> 01:45:14,460
Oh no!

2737
01:45:15,320 --> 01:45:16,280
Okay, I got it.

2738
01:45:16,400 --> 01:45:17,040
Most fuckable cat.

2739
01:45:19,740 --> 01:45:20,420
I'm done.

2740
01:45:20,740 --> 01:45:21,260
Alright.

2741
01:45:22,120 --> 01:45:23,060
Let's build a thunderclan.

2742
01:45:23,140 --> 01:45:24,420
We'll populate this clan.

2743
01:45:24,580 --> 01:45:27,420
We'll populate this clan!

2744
01:45:28,060 --> 01:45:28,620
We'll populate this clan!

2745
01:45:28,620 --> 01:45:29,120
Okay, wait, wait.

2746
01:45:29,320 --> 01:45:32,200
Are you the only one in thunderclan?

2747
01:45:32,500 --> 01:45:33,640
Is that you?

2748
01:45:34,640 --> 01:45:35,440
The HUD.

2749
01:45:35,560 --> 01:45:38,800
The bottom HUD buttons can be used to change clans.

2750
01:45:38,880 --> 01:45:40,160
The bottom HUD buttons can be used to change clans.

2751
01:45:40,160 --> 01:45:43,940
This menu lets you edit information about your character such as name and description.

2752
01:45:44,500 --> 01:45:44,740
This menu lets you edit information about your character such as name and description.

2753
01:45:44,740 --> 01:45:44,920
Okay.

2754
01:45:45,220 --> 01:45:47,360
You can check out the animation sitting.

2755
01:45:48,240 --> 01:45:49,720
Change your clan allegiance.

2756
01:45:49,720 --> 01:45:51,840
Go to the other location or see a map.

2757
01:45:52,960 --> 01:45:53,480
Alright.

2758
01:45:54,420 --> 01:45:55,520
Oh my god, look at me.

2759
01:45:55,540 --> 01:45:55,880
I'm baby.

2760
01:45:57,200 --> 01:45:58,160
I'm baby.

2761
01:45:58,480 --> 01:46:00,080
Wait, I wanna change my cat info.

2762
01:46:01,420 --> 01:46:02,120
I'm baby.

2763
01:46:02,120 --> 01:46:02,120
Wait, I wanna change my cat info.

2764
01:46:02,120 --> 01:46:03,100
Doki and Kit.

2765
01:46:06,550 --> 01:46:10,350
This Kit is going to grow up and be...

2766
01:46:10,350 --> 01:46:10,550
This Kit is going to grow up and be...

2767
01:46:11,090 --> 01:46:11,610
This Kit is going to grow up and be...

2768
01:46:11,610 --> 01:46:11,850
a...

2769
01:46:11,850 --> 01:46:14,370
a fuckboy.

2770
01:46:17,930 --> 01:46:18,730
There we go.

2771
01:46:18,870 --> 01:46:19,550
Did I save it?

2772
01:46:19,550 --> 01:46:20,550
Oh, I forgot.

2773
01:46:20,570 --> 01:46:20,810
Okay.

2774
01:46:20,850 --> 01:46:25,470
This Kit is going to grow up and be a...

2775
01:46:26,970 --> 01:46:27,610
bad...

2776
01:46:27,610 --> 01:46:29,410
a bad boy.

2777
01:46:30,610 --> 01:46:32,110
A bad boy.

2778
01:46:32,490 --> 01:46:34,250
A bad boy.

2779
01:46:34,690 --> 01:46:36,350
This is me.

2780
01:46:37,250 --> 01:46:39,030
I'm the tiniest Kit out there.

2781
01:46:39,650 --> 01:46:42,810
I can't believe no one wants to join thunderclan.

2782
01:46:43,110 --> 01:46:43,470
I can't believe no one wants to join thunderclan.

2783
01:46:43,470 --> 01:46:44,190
Are you Breedpelt?

2784
01:46:44,350 --> 01:46:44,830
That's you.

2785
01:46:44,870 --> 01:46:45,310
Oh my god.

2786
01:46:45,330 --> 01:46:46,010
You're Breedpelt.

2787
01:46:46,130 --> 01:46:48,390
You're Breedpelt.

2788
01:46:50,430 --> 01:46:51,870
Oh fuck, of course you are.

2789
01:46:52,110 --> 01:46:53,110
Hey, hey, hey.

2790
01:46:54,550 --> 01:46:56,130
Dude, there's somebody else here.

2791
01:46:56,150 --> 01:46:57,530
Dude, look at our thunderclan.

2792
01:46:57,550 --> 01:46:58,530
It's already so populated.

2793
01:46:58,530 --> 01:46:59,510
We already fucking...

2794
01:46:59,510 --> 01:47:01,230
We fucking populated thunderclan.

2795
01:47:01,810 --> 01:47:04,050
There's so many fucking... Oh my god.

2796
01:47:04,210 --> 01:47:04,590
...crow pelts.

2797
01:47:04,590 --> 01:47:04,990
Breedpelt.

2798
01:47:05,030 --> 01:47:06,290
There's like five crow pelts here.

2799
01:47:08,010 --> 01:47:09,190
Breedpelt, you did it.

2800
01:47:09,230 --> 01:47:10,290
You repopulated.

2801
01:47:11,270 --> 01:47:12,350
When you were a kid too.

2802
01:47:12,690 --> 01:47:13,090
Nevermind.

2803
01:47:14,150 --> 01:47:14,550
Nevermind.

2804
01:47:14,590 --> 01:47:15,610
You're also a kid.

2805
01:47:15,610 --> 01:47:15,990
Wait, wait.

2806
01:47:16,110 --> 01:47:16,570
Sides up.

2807
01:47:16,630 --> 01:47:16,990
Sides up.

2808
01:47:17,010 --> 01:47:17,450
Sides up.

2809
01:47:18,030 --> 01:47:18,550
Sides up.

2810
01:47:18,590 --> 01:47:18,770
Sides up.

2811
01:47:18,770 --> 01:47:18,930
Sides up.

2812
01:47:19,550 --> 01:47:20,470
It still says a kid.

2813
01:47:20,930 --> 01:47:22,270
It still says kid.

2814
01:47:22,630 --> 01:47:25,010
It says I should be an apprentice.

2815
01:47:25,390 --> 01:47:26,050
Change rule.

2816
01:47:26,130 --> 01:47:26,670
Oh, change rule.

2817
01:47:26,990 --> 01:47:27,930
Oh, nice.

2818
01:47:28,030 --> 01:47:30,190
So you can size down, but you can change your rule too.

2819
01:47:30,290 --> 01:47:30,950
Oh my god.

2820
01:47:30,950 --> 01:47:31,350
Wait, wait.

2821
01:47:31,770 --> 01:47:33,070
How do I size up?

2822
01:47:33,650 --> 01:47:34,470
How do you do it?

2823
01:47:35,210 --> 01:47:37,550
Just click on the bottom.

2824
01:47:37,550 --> 01:47:38,670
There's your cat info.

2825
01:47:38,810 --> 01:47:41,130
And you can add your canonical cat name.

2826
01:47:41,330 --> 01:47:44,090
And then you can add a description like Super edgy.

2827
01:47:44,230 --> 01:47:45,010
Oh my god.

2828
01:47:45,010 --> 01:47:45,990
I'm a big cat.

2829
01:47:46,110 --> 01:47:46,910
I'm a big kid.

2830
01:47:51,450 --> 01:47:55,750
Just so you know, there was something in my mama's milk that made me like this.

2831
01:47:55,970 --> 01:47:57,710
Something in your mama's milk?

2832
01:47:59,230 --> 01:48:00,570
In the cadmium?

2833
01:48:01,250 --> 01:48:02,570
She's got the asbestos.

2834
01:48:03,310 --> 01:48:04,730
She lived in the barn.

2835
01:48:04,770 --> 01:48:05,210
In the attic.

2836
01:48:05,690 --> 01:48:07,130
My cat mom.

2837
01:48:07,410 --> 01:48:12,210
My cat mom was definitely taking something.

2838
01:48:16,970 --> 01:48:18,990
That's why I grew up big and strong.

2839
01:48:19,770 --> 01:48:20,250
That's why I grew up big and strong.

2840
01:48:21,370 --> 01:48:22,210
That's why I grew up big and strong.

2841
01:48:22,570 --> 01:48:25,990
This kid is going to grow up and be a bad boy.

2842
01:48:28,530 --> 01:48:29,270
That's me.

2843
01:48:30,170 --> 01:48:30,610
That's me.

2844
01:48:30,610 --> 01:48:31,290
Wait, what did you say?

2845
01:48:34,270 --> 01:48:35,370
I'm a bad boy.

2846
01:48:35,950 --> 01:48:37,250
We should visit the other clans.

2847
01:48:37,390 --> 01:48:40,350
We can wage war on them.

2848
01:48:40,470 --> 01:48:42,090
I love how we're all just black cats.

2849
01:48:42,210 --> 01:48:44,030
We've literally created the crow-pelt.

2850
01:48:45,430 --> 01:48:49,570
WinClan was the one that had a lot of people.

2851
01:48:49,670 --> 01:48:50,290
Too many people.

2852
01:48:50,430 --> 01:48:51,270
They had it too good.

2853
01:48:51,870 --> 01:48:53,530
I'm going to go in there.

2854
01:48:54,030 --> 01:48:55,870
Are they roleplaying right now?

2855
01:48:56,770 --> 01:48:57,690
Oh my god.

2856
01:48:58,070 --> 01:49:00,290
Very nice cat and very friendly.

2857
01:49:00,390 --> 01:49:00,890
I'm so sorry.

2858
01:49:01,190 --> 01:49:03,050
A loyal and intelligent feline.

2859
01:49:03,590 --> 01:49:04,990
That's their medicine cat!

2860
01:49:06,350 --> 01:49:08,470
Wait, how do I talk to these people?

2861
01:49:08,770 --> 01:49:09,930
You want to go flirt with their medicine cat?

2862
01:49:10,370 --> 01:49:10,890
Hello.

2863
01:49:11,230 --> 01:49:12,090
I'm a joke.

2864
01:49:13,970 --> 01:49:14,950
I'm the leader.

2865
01:49:15,830 --> 01:49:18,110
From thunderclan.

2866
01:49:18,870 --> 01:49:20,110
I'm lost.

2867
01:49:20,450 --> 01:49:21,710
The leader?

2868
01:49:21,890 --> 01:49:22,350
Up front?

2869
01:49:22,990 --> 01:49:24,150
I'm lost.

2870
01:49:24,530 --> 01:49:27,890
Trying to find my mommy.

2871
01:49:29,770 --> 01:49:32,010
Look so random.

2872
01:49:32,950 --> 01:49:33,790
Wait.

2873
01:49:36,370 --> 01:49:42,150
Now that I'm the leader of thunderclan I gotta change my name canonically From breed pelt to breed...

2874
01:49:42,690 --> 01:49:44,030
You're the leader?

2875
01:49:44,990 --> 01:49:46,760
I'm having a conversation with...

2876
01:49:47,650 --> 01:49:48,150
with...

2877
01:49:48,150 --> 01:49:50,090
with Fury Oak.

2878
01:49:50,450 --> 01:49:51,490
Wait, what is this?

2879
01:49:51,550 --> 01:49:53,810
With the medicine... Oh no.

2880
01:49:53,910 --> 01:49:55,750
Am I ruining this...

2881
01:49:55,750 --> 01:49:58,930
this poor child's time trying to roleplay?

2882
01:50:00,690 --> 01:50:01,610
You gotta be cool.

2883
01:50:01,690 --> 01:50:02,650
You can be the deputy.

2884
01:50:02,870 --> 01:50:03,490
Or a queen.

2885
01:50:03,690 --> 01:50:05,610
Do you want to be the wetest kid?

2886
01:50:06,210 --> 01:50:08,970
Bro, the medicine guy is like, I don't know how to help you.

2887
01:50:08,970 --> 01:50:10,710
Do you know what they look like?

2888
01:50:12,230 --> 01:50:15,310
Wait, I should age size myself down.

2889
01:50:15,690 --> 01:50:17,370
I'm so sorry, child.

2890
01:50:26,690 --> 01:50:30,830
Stay far away from disgusting, evil cats.

2891
01:50:31,250 --> 01:50:32,650
Oh my god.

2892
01:50:33,070 --> 01:50:36,290
We have suffered through many losses today.

2893
01:50:36,350 --> 01:50:38,610
We mourn the loss of our past leader.

2894
01:50:38,650 --> 01:50:38,950
We mourn the loss of our past leader.

2895
01:50:38,970 --> 01:50:40,970
But tomorrow...

2896
01:50:40,970 --> 01:50:44,710
What the... this is an actual story going on!

2897
01:50:45,210 --> 01:50:46,130
This is an actual story going on!

2898
01:50:46,130 --> 01:50:46,410
Stuffy!

2899
01:50:46,430 --> 01:50:47,730
The roleplaying is!

2900
01:50:47,730 --> 01:50:49,170
The roleplaying is all about...

2901
01:50:49,170 --> 01:50:50,790
It's like writing a book.

2902
01:50:51,490 --> 01:50:56,850
Oh my god, there's so much immersion!

2903
01:50:57,570 --> 01:50:58,930
We gotta be in character.

2904
01:50:59,230 --> 01:51:00,930
Wait, this is High Rock, right?

2905
01:51:01,030 --> 01:51:01,970
So you gotta be like...

2906
01:51:01,970 --> 01:51:03,890
Let me get into my roleplay.

2907
01:51:03,970 --> 01:51:05,810
I'm looking at the clan leader.

2908
01:51:06,230 --> 01:51:08,690
If you go to innovations, you can do stuff too.

2909
01:51:08,730 --> 01:51:08,950
You can do stuff.

2910
01:51:08,950 --> 01:51:08,950
Yeah.

2911
01:51:09,710 --> 01:51:12,630
You can be like, Let me break into my role.

2912
01:51:12,830 --> 01:51:16,130
You know, I actually used to do warrior cat's roleplay on Neopets.

2913
01:51:16,130 --> 01:51:25,450
I actually used to do warrior cat's roleplay on Neopets, And my character was Wild Pelt.

2914
01:51:27,350 --> 01:51:32,230
I would do OOC, you know?

2915
01:51:32,290 --> 01:51:38,110
And then I had pre-built character sheets built out for my cat roleplay.

2916
01:51:38,970 --> 01:51:39,650
Oh my god!

2917
01:51:40,050 --> 01:51:41,850
No fucking- See, I did the same thing.

2918
01:51:41,930 --> 01:51:47,870
I don't know if- I didn't do Warrior Cats roleplay, but I think for a while I did like Bleach, like the anime Bleach.

2919
01:51:47,910 --> 01:51:48,890
Wait, on Neopets?

2920
01:51:49,270 --> 01:51:51,830
I- Okay, I did it on Gaia Online.

2921
01:51:56,920 --> 01:51:58,440
Tomorrow- No, I've never.

2922
01:51:58,560 --> 01:51:59,820
I was a Neopets girl.

2923
01:51:59,940 --> 01:52:06,980
Anyway, the fucking leader of WinClan was like, tomorrow we shall- I shall get my- Oh, they were- He was doing a clan meeting!

2924
01:52:07,320 --> 01:52:09,500
A Crash WinClan's clan meeting!

2925
01:52:10,920 --> 01:52:12,000
Fucking WinClan!

2926
01:52:12,080 --> 01:52:16,940
How did you even get there?

2927
01:52:17,260 --> 01:52:18,800
I visited WinClan!

2928
01:52:19,280 --> 01:52:21,380
I don't even know how to leave this one!

2929
01:52:25,090 --> 01:52:27,480
How do I leave the Purr for tomorrow?

2930
01:52:28,080 --> 01:52:31,860
You go to like the clan and map, and then you click join.

2931
01:52:32,200 --> 01:52:32,840
The map?

2932
01:52:32,940 --> 01:52:34,020
Wait, you just joined it?

2933
01:52:34,160 --> 01:52:37,280
No, I didn't join the clan, I just wanted- I visited their camp.

2934
01:52:37,580 --> 01:52:38,580
Go to camp.

2935
01:52:38,580 --> 01:52:40,980
Oh, I'm in RiverClan, that's the wrong place.

2936
01:52:41,160 --> 01:52:46,460
Don't worry, there's nothing fun happening now because- Oh my god, please start- Because I fucking crashed their clan.

2937
01:52:46,800 --> 01:52:48,880
I crashed their clan meeting.

2938
01:52:49,360 --> 01:52:50,940
Wait, what about ShadowClan?

2939
01:52:51,080 --> 01:52:52,000
What's ShadowClan doing?

2940
01:52:53,060 --> 01:52:54,560
Oh, you can drink water.

2941
01:52:55,360 --> 01:52:57,540
Is- Is ShadowClan still around?

2942
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:01,340
ShadowClan- Yeah, we've done away with those guys.

2943
01:53:01,480 --> 01:53:04,140
Yeah, everybody in ShadowClan's dead.

2944
01:53:04,280 --> 01:53:05,100
There's nobody here.

2945
01:53:05,380 --> 01:53:07,720
There's nobody in ShadowClan!

2946
01:53:07,960 --> 01:53:08,560
This just looks like the end of the world.

2947
01:53:08,560 --> 01:53:10,480
This is like ThunderClan reskin.

2948
01:53:10,860 --> 01:53:13,020
Bro, everybody in ShadowClan is dead.

2949
01:53:13,440 --> 01:53:15,900
A fresh kill pile, we gotta go kill somebody.

2950
01:53:16,120 --> 01:53:16,920
You wanna kill somebody?

2951
01:53:16,920 --> 01:53:17,500
You wanna kill somebody?

2952
01:53:17,660 --> 01:53:19,080
I gotta go feed the clan.

2953
01:53:19,360 --> 01:53:21,240
I remember when I first- Oh my god, there's the leader stand.

2954
01:53:21,340 --> 01:53:32,200
When I first joined up the WarriorCats RP server, and then I got some- Some like- What was it?

2955
01:53:32,260 --> 01:53:32,420
Queen?

2956
01:53:32,620 --> 01:53:35,360
Some queen to feed me, because I was like, wah.

2957
01:53:36,280 --> 01:53:43,900
Oh my- Okay, so can we reload and- Oh, I'm gonna go into a different server and just like- Can I get a mother in roleplay?

2958
01:53:43,980 --> 01:53:44,660
I need that.

2959
01:53:44,700 --> 01:53:45,760
I need a mother figure.

2960
01:53:45,960 --> 01:54:00,020
They like picked me up and was like- They picked me up and was like fucking feeding me and also trying to take care of me.

2961
01:54:00,340 --> 01:54:01,640
Sold, sold, sold, sold.

2962
01:54:01,840 --> 01:54:03,060
Let's go join WinClay.

2963
01:54:03,780 --> 01:54:10,120
We need to fucking find a- We need to find a- They camped where the queen is.

2964
01:54:11,020 --> 01:54:12,120
Where are the queens?

2965
01:54:12,120 --> 01:54:14,340
WinClay definitely has to have like a queen.

2966
01:54:14,840 --> 01:54:16,920
I feel- I gotta change breed star then.

2967
01:54:17,080 --> 01:54:18,060
That's too much.

2968
01:54:18,240 --> 01:54:18,960
What is it?

2969
01:54:18,980 --> 01:54:20,300
There's a loner here.

2970
01:54:20,960 --> 01:54:22,480
Where are all the other cats?

2971
01:54:26,340 --> 01:54:28,200
Where the fuck are the other cats?

2972
01:54:28,620 --> 01:54:33,320
Who are all- Only WinClan is alive apparently.

2973
01:54:34,860 --> 01:54:35,720
I don't know.

2974
01:54:35,800 --> 01:54:36,600
I don't know.

2975
01:54:36,640 --> 01:54:38,740
Who even wants WinClan?

2976
01:54:38,900 --> 01:54:39,920
Like what the hell even is WinClan?

2977
01:54:39,940 --> 01:54:40,020
Like who the fuck is that?

2978
01:54:40,140 --> 01:54:42,260
They weren't even relevant in the story at any point.

2979
01:54:42,300 --> 01:54:42,640
I know.

2980
01:54:43,220 --> 01:54:45,540
All the clans- Wait, what about the kitty pets?

2981
01:54:45,760 --> 01:54:47,400
I'm gonna check if the kitty pets are still around.

2982
01:54:47,480 --> 01:54:48,240
The kitty pets.

2983
01:54:48,620 --> 01:54:48,960
Yeah.

2984
01:54:51,940 --> 01:54:55,440
I got ignored by the kitty pets when during my first time.

2985
01:54:55,640 --> 01:54:57,000
I'm going to WinClan.

2986
01:54:57,080 --> 01:54:58,040
I'm gonna go find a mom.

2987
01:54:58,280 --> 01:55:00,580
You're gonna find a mom?!

2988
01:55:05,360 --> 01:55:07,360
There's fuck- Wait, how do I go inside?

2989
01:55:10,600 --> 01:55:11,280
I don't know.

2990
01:55:11,280 --> 01:55:12,200
Where's the door?

2991
01:55:13,020 --> 01:55:14,240
Oh, there's the door.

2992
01:55:15,040 --> 01:55:16,660
I don't know where, like...

2993
01:55:16,660 --> 01:55:17,660
How do I open doors?

2994
01:55:18,640 --> 01:55:21,620
How the fuck do anybody do anything as a kittypet?

2995
01:55:21,820 --> 01:55:22,520
This is so peaceful.

2996
01:55:23,700 --> 01:55:25,180
Something about this feels wrong.

2997
01:55:25,320 --> 01:55:26,780
Like, these people are at such peace.

2998
01:55:26,900 --> 01:55:28,440
Little cats sleeping away.

2999
01:55:28,560 --> 01:55:30,740
And I'm loading and being like, ma'amie.

3000
01:55:31,020 --> 01:55:31,760
Ma'amie.

3001
01:55:37,600 --> 01:55:38,060
Charm.

3002
01:55:38,520 --> 01:55:38,660
Charm.

3003
01:55:38,780 --> 01:55:39,140
Oh wait.

3004
01:55:39,520 --> 01:55:40,740
Me when I...

3005
01:55:40,740 --> 01:55:42,040
When I... When I...

3006
01:55:42,040 --> 01:55:44,120
Oh my god, there's a kittypet right here.

3007
01:55:44,820 --> 01:55:46,080
Oh, you found the kittypet?

3008
01:55:46,100 --> 01:55:47,340
I found some kittypets, yes.

3009
01:55:48,200 --> 01:55:48,680
Hello.

3010
01:55:49,720 --> 01:55:50,200
Hello.

3011
01:55:50,640 --> 01:55:51,540
I'm lost.

3012
01:55:53,160 --> 01:55:55,240
I'm trying to find my mommy.

3013
01:55:55,760 --> 01:55:57,920
Oh my gosh, I loaded right... wait.

3014
01:55:58,060 --> 01:55:59,880
I loaded like right in a bunch of them.

3015
01:55:59,960 --> 01:56:00,340
No, wait.

3016
01:56:00,380 --> 01:56:00,860
A child.

3017
01:56:05,300 --> 01:56:06,340
Is that you?

3018
01:56:06,500 --> 01:56:07,060
Is this you?

3019
01:56:07,140 --> 01:56:07,700
No way.

3020
01:56:07,700 --> 01:56:08,560
A child.

3021
01:56:08,760 --> 01:56:09,240
Wow.

3022
01:56:09,520 --> 01:56:10,520
No way.

3023
01:56:10,740 --> 01:56:12,660
You gotta be like EBC for mom.

3024
01:56:12,760 --> 01:56:16,780
This person's just saying censored things in fish emojis.

3025
01:56:17,420 --> 01:56:18,140
Really?

3026
01:56:19,440 --> 01:56:20,160
Hello.

3027
01:56:20,900 --> 01:56:23,020
Are you hungry for real?

3028
01:56:23,040 --> 01:56:23,500
For real?

3029
01:56:23,600 --> 01:56:24,320
No way.

3030
01:56:25,020 --> 01:56:25,880
I'm not.

3031
01:56:25,960 --> 01:56:26,820
I'm hungry.

3032
01:56:27,620 --> 01:56:28,520
I'm hungry.

3033
01:56:32,300 --> 01:56:36,220
I'm getting choked.

3034
01:56:36,740 --> 01:56:38,600
Oh my god, they're like, no way.

3035
01:56:39,120 --> 01:56:39,560
Stop.

3036
01:56:40,740 --> 01:56:43,040
Bro, this kittypet is so mean.

3037
01:56:44,060 --> 01:56:45,440
What is he doing?

3038
01:56:45,620 --> 01:56:47,580
He told me to starve.

3039
01:56:49,420 --> 01:56:51,080
I can't even tell what they're saying.

3040
01:56:51,220 --> 01:56:52,040
Horrendous thing.

3041
01:56:52,780 --> 01:56:55,000
They told me to starve.

3042
01:56:56,520 --> 01:56:59,280
What are the settings?

3043
01:56:59,460 --> 01:56:59,840
I don't know.

3044
01:57:00,200 --> 01:57:00,780
Animations.

3045
01:57:00,920 --> 01:57:01,460
Wait, animations.

3046
01:57:02,020 --> 01:57:03,540
I can't believe it.

3047
01:57:03,860 --> 01:57:05,520
I can't believe it.

3048
01:57:05,520 --> 01:57:06,880
This kittypet pooped.

3049
01:57:06,980 --> 01:57:09,460
I'm just trying to find a mama.

3050
01:57:09,720 --> 01:57:10,720
I'm a baby.

3051
01:57:10,740 --> 01:57:11,160
Baby.

3052
01:57:14,800 --> 01:57:16,340
I'm just a baby.

3053
01:57:17,660 --> 01:57:18,380
I'm just a baby.

3054
01:57:21,640 --> 01:57:22,880
They're so mean.

3055
01:57:22,920 --> 01:57:23,200
They're so mean.

3056
01:57:23,200 --> 01:57:24,320
I'm just a little kid.

3057
01:57:24,760 --> 01:57:26,020
I haven't grown up.

3058
01:57:26,320 --> 01:57:28,480
This is why I'm gonna be a bad boy.

3059
01:57:28,580 --> 01:57:30,220
It's because of my environment, Snuffy.

3060
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:34,580
I feel like we're like unloved kids at an adoption center.

3061
01:57:34,820 --> 01:57:35,000
Yeah.

3062
01:57:36,120 --> 01:57:38,880
This is why I become a bad boy.

3063
01:57:39,200 --> 01:57:39,680
Nobody.

3064
01:57:40,740 --> 01:57:42,280
Nobody loves me.

3065
01:57:42,780 --> 01:57:43,340
Yeah.

3066
01:57:44,120 --> 01:57:44,680
Yeah.

3067
01:57:45,940 --> 01:57:48,100
Oh my god, what the fuck are you doing?

3068
01:57:49,360 --> 01:57:49,920
Yeah.

3069
01:57:51,120 --> 01:57:52,980
What the fuck are you doing?

3070
01:57:53,660 --> 01:57:54,660
Oh, you know.

3071
01:57:54,740 --> 01:57:56,240
What happened to my name?

3072
01:57:56,560 --> 01:57:57,700
Wait, what happened to my name?

3073
01:57:57,780 --> 01:57:58,860
My name was good.

3074
01:57:59,160 --> 01:58:00,240
Oh, you got reported.

3075
01:58:00,640 --> 01:58:01,800
You got reported.

3076
01:58:02,860 --> 01:58:03,940
You got reported.

3077
01:58:05,800 --> 01:58:08,220
This is worse than Green Star.

3078
01:58:08,700 --> 01:58:10,420
I can't believe it.

3079
01:58:10,740 --> 01:58:11,840
You got reported.

3080
01:58:13,960 --> 01:58:15,300
Oh my god.

3081
01:58:15,380 --> 01:58:18,160
You're ruining this for children.

3082
01:58:18,440 --> 01:58:18,620
You're ruining this for children.

3083
01:58:18,620 --> 01:58:20,240
Wait, this is a kid's...

3084
01:58:21,120 --> 01:58:23,000
I'm not associating myself with you.

3085
01:58:23,320 --> 01:58:25,280
I'm not associating myself with you.

3086
01:58:26,860 --> 01:58:28,360
I'm not associating myself with you.

3087
01:58:28,360 --> 01:58:29,120
I don't know her.

3088
01:58:29,380 --> 01:58:30,440
I don't know her.

3089
01:58:30,540 --> 01:58:31,480
I'm running away.

3090
01:58:34,100 --> 01:58:35,120
Guys, we just...

3091
01:58:35,120 --> 01:58:37,900
You loaded up the game being like, man, I wanna be just like Crow Pelt.

3092
01:58:37,900 --> 01:58:39,260
He got so many bitches.

3093
01:58:39,720 --> 01:58:43,200
Yeah, but like, I didn't write that down.

3094
01:58:43,640 --> 01:58:45,320
I just wrote I'm gonna be a bad boy.

3095
01:58:45,780 --> 01:58:47,220
I didn't say anything.

3096
01:58:47,460 --> 01:58:51,080
I just said I was thirsty cause I wanted some mom to love me.

3097
01:58:51,200 --> 01:58:52,760
I was thirsty for love.

3098
01:58:53,040 --> 01:58:53,240
I was thirsty for love.

3099
01:58:54,820 --> 01:58:57,300
I think you're gonna get your account banned again.

3100
01:58:57,460 --> 01:58:59,040
I think you're gonna get your account banned again.

3101
01:58:59,040 --> 01:59:01,360
I think your account's gonna get banned.

3102
01:59:02,380 --> 01:59:02,460
I think your account's gonna get banned.

3103
01:59:02,460 --> 01:59:04,340
Oh, I didn't do anything wrong.

3104
01:59:04,680 --> 01:59:06,100
Why is this guy red?

3105
01:59:06,420 --> 01:59:07,440
Why is this guy red?

3106
01:59:07,460 --> 01:59:07,600
I'm red.

3107
01:59:07,900 --> 01:59:08,820
I didn't read the description.

3108
01:59:09,320 --> 01:59:10,300
I read it.

3109
01:59:10,840 --> 01:59:12,140
What do you mean?

3110
01:59:13,960 --> 01:59:15,080
I literally...

3111
01:59:15,680 --> 01:59:17,960
Oh my god, there's like a bunch of loners.

3112
01:59:18,160 --> 01:59:19,880
You felt cold for a second.

3113
01:59:19,940 --> 01:59:20,880
Warm for another.

3114
01:59:21,440 --> 01:59:22,640
Then cold again.

3115
01:59:22,760 --> 01:59:24,700
You needed something to keep you anchor.

3116
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:26,760
What you snarred.

3117
01:59:27,600 --> 01:59:28,160
Everyone...

3118
01:59:28,160 --> 01:59:30,980
Happy Christmas.

3119
01:59:32,700 --> 01:59:33,260
Starve.

3120
01:59:33,400 --> 01:59:34,160
Oh my god.

3121
01:59:34,520 --> 01:59:36,220
We keep getting told to starve.

3122
01:59:38,140 --> 01:59:39,440
This is my house.

3123
01:59:39,580 --> 01:59:41,280
Her stomach growled.

3124
01:59:41,460 --> 01:59:42,600
Wait, I gotta type this.

3125
01:59:43,600 --> 01:59:44,620
Wait, oh wait.

3126
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:45,840
Okay, wait.

3127
01:59:45,940 --> 01:59:47,240
How do I fucking...

3128
01:59:47,240 --> 01:59:48,700
Dude, I picked up a toy.

3129
01:59:49,160 --> 01:59:50,420
I need to talk to everybody.

3130
01:59:52,920 --> 01:59:55,860
Doki Pelt looked around the barn.

3131
01:59:56,800 --> 01:59:59,480
She was still lost in...

3132
02:00:00,360 --> 02:00:03,700
Trying to find her way.

3133
02:00:04,220 --> 02:00:06,780
She saw several cats in the barn.

3134
02:00:06,780 --> 02:00:07,240
She was still lost in Mannagham.

3135
02:00:07,240 --> 02:00:08,360
She saw several cats in front of her.

3136
02:00:08,840 --> 02:00:10,400
Her stomach growled.

3137
02:00:13,540 --> 02:00:14,580
Has anyone...

3138
02:00:14,580 --> 02:00:16,240
seen my mom?

3139
02:00:20,060 --> 02:00:21,360
Wait, not Doki Pelt.

3140
02:00:21,420 --> 02:00:21,660
Sorry.

3141
02:00:21,900 --> 02:00:22,820
Doki Kit.

3142
02:00:24,720 --> 02:00:26,480
You're aging yourself up so early.

3143
02:00:26,500 --> 02:00:26,940
To verily, Kit.

3144
02:00:28,600 --> 02:00:30,460
Why didn't we all make it...

3145
02:00:30,460 --> 02:00:33,080
Why didn't everybody chose their cat to be Cropelt, like...

3146
02:00:33,080 --> 02:00:34,720
They're all black cats with blue eyes.

3147
02:00:35,580 --> 02:00:37,120
Because... it said, I'm sorry.

3148
02:00:37,240 --> 02:00:39,300
Because you guys all wanna be special.

3149
02:00:39,440 --> 02:00:40,780
I wanna be realistic.

3150
02:00:41,420 --> 02:00:42,880
I don't wanna be...

3151
02:00:42,880 --> 02:00:44,720
There's so many cats in this house.

3152
02:00:44,780 --> 02:00:46,360
We belong to some crazy cat lady.

3153
02:00:47,240 --> 02:00:54,380
Bro, this entire story is about being in a c- It's written by four cat ladies.

3154
02:00:54,740 --> 02:00:58,220
I mean, literally this is a cat lady literature genre.

3155
02:00:59,120 --> 02:00:59,640
Like...

3156
02:01:01,320 --> 02:01:02,860
Did anyone talk to me?

3157
02:01:03,320 --> 02:01:06,760
No, no, everybody's ignoring me because I'm a cat lady.

3158
02:01:06,760 --> 02:01:07,240
I'm a child!

3159
02:01:09,490 --> 02:01:11,460
Everyone watches TV in the house.

3160
02:01:12,490 --> 02:01:16,100
I hope they have Garfield on TV right now.

3161
02:01:16,640 --> 02:01:19,280
Minus one RP, Snuffy!

3162
02:01:21,520 --> 02:01:23,520
You're not immersive!

3163
02:01:24,660 --> 02:01:33,180
Retta's on the couch as she flips through the channel's haphazard room.

3164
02:01:38,240 --> 02:01:40,340
I'm on the couch as she flips through the channel's haphazard room.

3165
02:01:40,440 --> 02:01:40,880
We're

3166
02:01:47,330 --> 02:01:48,210
in the house!

3167
02:01:48,210 --> 02:01:48,890
We're in the house!

3168
02:01:48,890 --> 02:01:49,870
There's a TV and everything!

3169
02:01:50,110 --> 02:01:51,030
It's not bad RP!

3170
02:01:51,190 --> 02:01:52,770
This is- We're literally indoor cats.

3171
02:01:53,050 --> 02:01:54,050
I'm indoor cat RP!

3172
02:01:55,890 --> 02:01:57,190
There's like a cat tower and everything!

3173
02:01:57,190 --> 02:01:58,470
Oh my god, they're gonna pick me up!

3174
02:01:59,290 --> 02:02:01,030
Oh my god, they picked me up!

3175
02:02:01,030 --> 02:02:01,770
How did they get picked up?

3176
02:02:01,790 --> 02:02:03,370
They asked my permission.

3177
02:02:04,610 --> 02:02:05,050
Okay.

3178
02:02:05,190 --> 02:02:07,070
They asked my permission and I got picked up.

3179
02:02:07,230 --> 02:02:08,450
Oh my god, where am I going?

3180
02:02:09,270 --> 02:02:10,550
Is he gonna feed me?

3181
02:02:11,030 --> 02:02:12,330
Is this my new mom?

3182
02:02:12,330 --> 02:02:12,850
Am I too big?

3183
02:02:12,930 --> 02:02:14,270
Do I need to be extra small?

3184
02:02:14,450 --> 02:02:14,910
I don't...

3185
02:02:14,910 --> 02:02:15,530
I'm down five.

3186
02:02:17,310 --> 02:02:18,390
They put me down.

3187
02:02:19,810 --> 02:02:20,910
I can't move.

3188
02:02:21,070 --> 02:02:22,390
I did something to my game.

3189
02:02:22,430 --> 02:02:23,390
I wish you held and cradled.

3190
02:02:25,390 --> 02:02:25,830
Okay.

3191
02:02:25,950 --> 02:02:26,810
How do I move?

3192
02:02:27,570 --> 02:02:28,170
Feed me.

3193
02:02:30,070 --> 02:02:30,510
Oh.

3194
02:02:30,510 --> 02:02:30,950
Yeah!

3195
02:02:31,570 --> 02:02:32,610
Did you get picked up?

3196
02:02:33,110 --> 02:02:34,090
Yeah, I got picked up.

3197
02:02:34,110 --> 02:02:35,010
You gotta be extra tiny.

3198
02:02:35,310 --> 02:02:36,430
Oh my gosh, that's great.

3199
02:02:36,510 --> 02:02:37,730
I'm extra tiny right now.

3200
02:02:37,890 --> 02:02:40,070
I love how you're like curled up so much.

3201
02:02:42,330 --> 02:02:43,650
A little Pete's.

3202
02:02:44,390 --> 02:02:45,110
Hurt.

3203
02:02:45,110 --> 02:02:46,410
I know, I'm so tiny.

3204
02:02:47,290 --> 02:02:48,010
Hurt.

3205
02:02:48,130 --> 02:02:49,770
Are you ready for it?

3206
02:02:54,130 --> 02:02:55,850
Wait, sheave claws?

3207
02:02:56,450 --> 02:02:57,550
Oh my god.

3208
02:02:58,090 --> 02:02:59,350
Can I do animations?

3209
02:02:59,530 --> 02:03:00,610
Can I like sleep?

3210
02:03:00,850 --> 02:03:01,890
No, you can't do anything.

3211
02:03:04,070 --> 02:03:06,510
Doki continues to...

3212
02:03:06,510 --> 02:03:09,970
Doki continues to starve.

3213
02:03:10,450 --> 02:03:12,310
Waiting for something.

3214
02:03:12,330 --> 02:03:14,210
Some cat...

3215
02:03:14,210 --> 02:03:16,350
to give her food.

3216
02:03:20,560 --> 02:03:21,740
Doki continues to starve.

3217
02:03:22,260 --> 02:03:22,760
Doki continues to starve.

3218
02:03:22,760 --> 02:03:23,520
I'm like...

3219
02:03:23,520 --> 02:03:26,420
I need food guys.

3220
02:03:26,860 --> 02:03:27,560
Where am I?

3221
02:03:27,720 --> 02:03:29,160
Oh my god, these guys pick me up.

3222
02:03:31,140 --> 02:03:33,680
They're gonna pick me up and give me food, I think.

3223
02:03:34,160 --> 02:03:34,480
They're gonna pick me up and give me food, I think.

3224
02:03:34,480 --> 02:03:35,580
Wait, where are you?

3225
02:03:35,940 --> 02:03:37,020
Are you not in my house?

3226
02:03:37,020 --> 02:03:37,420
I'm in the barn.

3227
02:03:37,740 --> 02:03:39,060
No, I'm in the loner stuff.

3228
02:03:39,620 --> 02:03:40,620
The loner?

3229
02:03:40,780 --> 02:03:42,980
Where's the kitty belt stuff?

3230
02:03:44,260 --> 02:03:44,760
The kitty belt stuff?

3231
02:03:44,760 --> 02:03:45,220
Where's the cat belt stuff?

3232
02:03:45,240 --> 02:03:45,880
The loner!

3233
02:03:48,240 --> 02:03:49,780
What do you eat?

3234
02:03:52,440 --> 02:04:00,320
Doki Kit looks up to the cat, to the strange loner that picked her up.

3235
02:04:01,400 --> 02:04:01,980
Anything.

3236
02:04:03,520 --> 02:04:04,960
I'm so hungry.

3237
02:04:08,940 --> 02:04:13,740
See, I'm just trying to find a parental figure who will love me, but I think I'm getting kidnapped.

3238
02:04:13,740 --> 02:04:15,520
I'm getting abducted right now!

3239
02:04:15,640 --> 02:04:17,340
You're dragging me into the street!

3240
02:04:20,240 --> 02:04:21,680
Plus one IV.

3241
02:04:22,140 --> 02:04:23,640
I'm so immersive.

3242
02:04:24,380 --> 02:04:25,260
I'm hungry.

3243
02:04:27,280 --> 02:04:32,240
I'm pulling up my Neopets roleplay right now.

3244
02:04:32,680 --> 02:04:33,920
That's medicine!

3245
02:04:35,980 --> 02:04:38,440
Do you even flip and turn?

3246
02:04:39,040 --> 02:04:40,980
Okay, I'm gonna eat my heart.

3247
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:42,680
How do I go to the...

3248
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:44,560
loners?

3249
02:04:44,780 --> 02:04:47,360
I'm eating grass right now, Snuffy.

3250
02:04:47,640 --> 02:04:48,080
You eat grass?

3251
02:04:48,280 --> 02:04:49,560
I ate my grass.

3252
02:04:50,300 --> 02:04:51,300
I did it.

3253
02:04:51,440 --> 02:04:52,020
I ate it.

3254
02:04:52,320 --> 02:04:53,320
It's good.

3255
02:04:53,920 --> 02:04:55,580
They made me eat grass.

3256
02:04:55,980 --> 02:04:56,040
Do you eat like, hay?

3257
02:04:56,300 --> 02:04:57,040
Like a horsey?

3258
02:04:57,160 --> 02:04:58,420
There's like cat mint.

3259
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:00,860
Oh my god, there's so many loners here.

3260
02:05:01,060 --> 02:05:06,520
Look, I spent more than one year roleplaying warrior cats on Neopets.

3261
02:05:06,680 --> 02:05:09,080
More than one year roleplaying?

3262
02:05:09,480 --> 02:05:10,780
Okay, I would do like...

3263
02:05:10,780 --> 02:05:11,420
That's all I need to be here.

3264
02:05:11,660 --> 02:05:12,240
I would do like...

3265
02:05:12,240 --> 02:05:19,920
High school roleplay, Neopets roleplay, magical fantasy roleplay.

3266
02:05:20,060 --> 02:05:25,360
And then I would have like character sheets of like templates of all these Neopets roleplay.

3267
02:05:25,440 --> 02:05:27,960
There's like a roleplay board in Neopets.

3268
02:05:30,060 --> 02:05:31,720
That's what I did on Gaia Online.

3269
02:05:31,880 --> 02:05:34,940
They would have like roleplay guilds and forums that you could join.

3270
02:05:34,960 --> 02:05:39,040
Yeah, and then there's like one where it was like superheroes school roleplay.

3271
02:05:39,160 --> 02:05:39,860
I had so many.

3272
02:05:40,140 --> 02:05:40,700
Superheroes school.

3273
02:05:40,700 --> 02:05:48,560
Yeah, and then I remember one of them, one of my templates was like a guy that knew like telepathy or some shit.

3274
02:05:48,720 --> 02:05:50,380
I was like telekinesis.

3275
02:05:50,480 --> 02:05:51,740
Oh yeah, telekinesis.

3276
02:05:52,540 --> 02:05:53,520
Oh my god.

3277
02:05:54,960 --> 02:05:57,420
I was on the roleplay leaderboard.

3278
02:05:58,120 --> 02:05:59,700
There's some good stuff then.

3279
02:05:59,760 --> 02:06:02,640
If you're into that, then I have many a world to take you.

3280
02:06:02,660 --> 02:06:04,700
Do you want to try a different Roblox world?

3281
02:06:04,820 --> 02:06:05,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3282
02:06:05,920 --> 02:06:06,180
Yeah, yeah.

3283
02:06:06,280 --> 02:06:06,540
Okay.

3284
02:06:07,180 --> 02:06:08,720
Doki Kid signing out.

3285
02:06:10,680 --> 02:06:11,680
Doki Kid leaving.

3286
02:06:11,680 --> 02:06:13,380
At least I got fed after all this time.

3287
02:06:13,640 --> 02:06:17,440
I got fed and I'm okay now.

3288
02:06:22,580 --> 02:06:24,600
Get fed, leaves.

3289
02:06:24,620 --> 02:06:26,020
Actual wildcat RP.

3290
02:06:26,280 --> 02:06:27,620
That really works.

3291
02:06:31,240 --> 02:06:33,780
I got fed, I leave now.

3292
02:06:33,940 --> 02:06:34,420
Goodbye.

3293
02:06:36,020 --> 02:06:36,700
That's it.

3294
02:06:37,860 --> 02:06:38,540
I'm leaving.

3295
02:06:38,540 --> 02:06:39,620
That's all that matters.

3296
02:06:43,140 --> 02:06:44,280
Let's see, let's see.

3297
02:06:44,320 --> 02:06:46,340
What's another good roleplay one?

3298
02:06:48,020 --> 02:06:48,460
Um...

3299
02:06:49,500 --> 02:06:50,340
Oh my god.

3300
02:06:50,480 --> 02:06:50,940
Where do I go?

3301
02:06:51,120 --> 02:06:56,560
There's one that like it's not as funny and I genuinely, but I genuinely have like a super good time with it.

3302
02:06:56,740 --> 02:06:59,440
Um, I don't know if I can find it.

3303
02:07:00,440 --> 02:07:00,880
Uh...

3304
02:07:01,500 --> 02:07:02,240
What is it called?

3305
02:07:03,620 --> 02:07:05,760
It's something, it's something fantasy themed.

3306
02:07:05,880 --> 02:07:06,580
It's really fun.

3307
02:07:06,640 --> 02:07:08,320
It's like those games where you...

3308
02:07:08,320 --> 02:07:09,880
like have to survive.

3309
02:07:10,100 --> 02:07:11,220
Like as a character.

3310
02:07:11,320 --> 02:07:14,160
Like an animal and like other animals can eat you and shit.

3311
02:07:14,220 --> 02:07:16,520
It's basically the roleplay but like for serious though.

3312
02:07:16,640 --> 02:07:17,280
Like that's the mechanic.

3313
02:07:17,580 --> 02:07:17,920
Wait, what is it?

3314
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:18,480
What is it called?

3315
02:07:19,040 --> 02:07:19,560
You don't know?

3316
02:07:19,580 --> 02:07:19,900
Oh man.

3317
02:07:20,840 --> 02:07:22,300
Something with an E maybe.

3318
02:07:22,400 --> 02:07:23,460
Let me see if I can find it.

3319
02:07:23,680 --> 02:07:26,460
The one that says the weather survival game is like really good.

3320
02:07:27,500 --> 02:07:28,740
Oh, natural disaster?

3321
02:07:29,240 --> 02:07:30,160
That's super fun.

3322
02:07:30,360 --> 02:07:31,320
That one's just a fun one.

3323
02:07:31,380 --> 02:07:32,620
Weather, weather, that weather...

3324
02:07:32,620 --> 02:07:34,040
Oh, it's natural survivor?

3325
02:07:35,080 --> 02:07:35,800
What's it about?

3326
02:07:36,740 --> 02:07:37,740
Um, it's like...

3327
02:07:37,740 --> 02:07:38,300
We can play that one.

3328
02:07:38,320 --> 02:07:40,120
It's super, it's super fast and easy.

3329
02:07:40,260 --> 02:07:41,380
It's like, oh my god.

3330
02:07:41,420 --> 02:07:44,520
Probably one of the oldest classic Roblox games right there.

3331
02:07:45,380 --> 02:07:46,820
Natural disaster survival.

3332
02:07:47,040 --> 02:07:48,460
I can link you to if you don't see it.

3333
02:07:48,460 --> 02:07:48,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3334
02:07:49,260 --> 02:07:50,640
I'll just click on your link.

3335
02:07:51,420 --> 02:07:52,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3336
02:07:52,220 --> 02:07:53,920
This one is super fun.

3337
02:07:54,060 --> 02:07:55,940
So instead of a curse game, this is a classic.

3338
02:07:57,480 --> 02:07:57,880
Survival.

3339
02:07:58,940 --> 02:07:59,340
Okay.

3340
02:08:00,700 --> 02:08:03,260
I'm waiting for this to pop up so I can join you.

3341
02:08:04,020 --> 02:08:04,420
Open.

3342
02:08:05,740 --> 02:08:07,640
Open my Roblox game client.

3343
02:08:11,330 --> 02:08:12,870
I hope the kids are okay.

3344
02:08:13,310 --> 02:08:15,550
I don't think kids...

3345
02:08:16,030 --> 02:08:18,870
This is all about how much the kids are okay.

3346
02:08:18,990 --> 02:08:22,810
This is like Chester Kids on where if they know where to go during a natural...

3347
02:08:22,810 --> 02:08:23,510
What the hell?

3348
02:08:23,970 --> 02:08:26,370
Now we're back into regular Roblox territory and it's gone.

3349
02:08:26,370 --> 02:08:28,030
You're best to survive the natural disaster.

3350
02:08:28,230 --> 02:08:29,570
If you die, you can spectate others.

3351
02:08:32,230 --> 02:08:33,170
Are you in here?

3352
02:08:33,690 --> 02:08:34,990
Yeah, I think I'm in here.

3353
02:08:35,070 --> 02:08:35,150
Wait.

3354
02:08:35,930 --> 02:08:37,090
Was it you?

3355
02:08:37,090 --> 02:08:38,130
Maybe my room...

3356
02:08:38,130 --> 02:08:38,850
Oh, no, no, no, no.

3357
02:08:38,850 --> 02:08:39,970
I think my room got full.

3358
02:08:40,090 --> 02:08:41,950
I'll just join again and see if I got into yours.

3359
02:08:42,310 --> 02:08:43,550
I don't know where I am.

3360
02:08:45,710 --> 02:08:46,570
There's this cool guy.

3361
02:08:46,810 --> 02:08:47,490
Oh my God.

3362
02:08:47,550 --> 02:08:48,190
Look at him.

3363
02:08:48,390 --> 02:08:48,850
Damn it.

3364
02:08:48,910 --> 02:08:49,290
Okay, wait.

3365
02:08:49,330 --> 02:08:49,870
Close the game.

3366
02:08:50,690 --> 02:08:52,710
I think we'll have to load up together somehow.

3367
02:08:53,190 --> 02:08:55,850
There's a giant fucking chick called BP is cool.

3368
02:08:58,410 --> 02:08:58,730
Okay.

3369
02:08:58,830 --> 02:08:59,110
Okay.

3370
02:08:59,330 --> 02:08:59,650
Okay.

3371
02:08:59,750 --> 02:09:01,150
I'm going to load into it.

3372
02:09:01,370 --> 02:09:02,070
Are you in my room?

3373
02:09:02,730 --> 02:09:04,190
No, I think yours is full.

3374
02:09:04,310 --> 02:09:05,210
This game is really popular.

3375
02:09:05,350 --> 02:09:05,630
Oh, really?

3376
02:09:05,750 --> 02:09:06,070
Okay.

3377
02:09:06,070 --> 02:09:06,210
Okay.

3378
02:09:06,210 --> 02:09:06,470
Wait.

3379
02:09:06,630 --> 02:09:08,110
How can I join with you, though?

3380
02:09:08,730 --> 02:09:09,430
I don't...

3381
02:09:09,430 --> 02:09:11,850
See, this is the fun part of Roblox.

3382
02:09:11,910 --> 02:09:12,810
I don't really...

3383
02:09:13,170 --> 02:09:13,530
Okay.

3384
02:09:14,870 --> 02:09:15,230
Wait.

3385
02:09:15,350 --> 02:09:15,630
I'm going to...

3386
02:09:16,190 --> 02:09:16,550
Okay.

3387
02:09:16,650 --> 02:09:19,010
On the count of three, let's like, put it up together.

3388
02:09:19,270 --> 02:09:21,310
Like, one, two...

3389
02:09:21,930 --> 02:09:22,290
Wait, wait, wait.

3390
02:09:22,290 --> 02:09:22,430
Oh, okay.

3391
02:09:22,490 --> 02:09:22,670
Okay.

3392
02:09:22,710 --> 02:09:22,810
Okay.

3393
02:09:22,850 --> 02:09:23,370
I'm ready.

3394
02:09:23,910 --> 02:09:24,270
Okay.

3395
02:09:24,410 --> 02:09:27,770
One, two, three.

3396
02:09:27,890 --> 02:09:28,170
Okay.

3397
02:09:28,250 --> 02:09:28,470
Boom.

3398
02:09:28,830 --> 02:09:29,290
Let's see.

3399
02:09:29,350 --> 02:09:29,510
Yeah.

3400
02:09:29,550 --> 02:09:30,330
Let's see if we can load it together.

3401
02:09:30,330 --> 02:09:30,510
Okay.

3402
02:09:30,510 --> 02:09:30,610
Okay.

3403
02:09:30,630 --> 02:09:30,930
Yeah.

3404
02:09:31,030 --> 02:09:31,250
Yeah.

3405
02:09:31,290 --> 02:09:31,470
Yeah.

3406
02:09:31,470 --> 02:09:34,230
Maybe like, we should mute ourselves and then...

3407
02:09:34,230 --> 02:09:35,410
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3408
02:09:35,630 --> 02:09:37,410
Maybe that's easier.

3409
02:09:40,530 --> 02:09:41,050
All right.

3410
02:09:41,230 --> 02:09:41,890
Did you load it?

3411
02:09:41,990 --> 02:09:42,550
I'm loading it.

3412
02:09:42,630 --> 02:09:42,770
Yeah.

3413
02:09:42,850 --> 02:09:43,210
I'm ready.

3414
02:09:43,990 --> 02:09:44,350
Okay.

3415
02:09:44,390 --> 02:09:44,630
I don't...

3416
02:09:44,630 --> 02:09:45,450
I don't see you.

3417
02:09:45,510 --> 02:09:45,870
Dang it.

3418
02:09:45,870 --> 02:09:46,050
Okay.

3419
02:09:46,130 --> 02:09:46,310
Okay.

3420
02:09:47,210 --> 02:09:48,510
I see San Francisco.

3421
02:09:49,850 --> 02:09:50,830
There were no survivors.

3422
02:09:51,570 --> 02:09:51,930
Okay.

3423
02:09:51,930 --> 02:09:52,130
Okay.

3424
02:09:53,150 --> 02:09:55,830
I'm going to mute my stream audio so nobody can hear us.

3425
02:09:55,910 --> 02:09:56,090
Okay.

3426
02:09:56,090 --> 02:09:56,610
I'm going to...

3427
02:09:58,270 --> 02:09:58,910
I'm going to...

3428
02:09:58,910 --> 02:10:00,170
I'm going to mute mine, too.

3429
02:10:00,250 --> 02:10:01,450
I was going to say, I'm not going to mute mine.

3430
02:10:01,450 --> 02:10:01,850
I'm going to mute mine.

3431
02:10:02,390 --> 02:10:02,850
I'm going to mute mine.

3432
02:10:02,850 --> 02:10:02,990
I'm going to mute mine.

3433
02:10:02,990 --> 02:10:03,030
I'm going to mute mine.

3434
02:10:03,030 --> 02:10:03,730
There's Woody.

3435
02:10:03,990 --> 02:10:05,290
Oh, you guys are missing out.

3436
02:10:05,570 --> 02:10:06,530
You don't see Woody.

3437
02:10:09,090 --> 02:10:09,450
Okay.

3438
02:10:09,550 --> 02:10:09,870
I'm...

3439
02:10:09,870 --> 02:10:10,470
I'm opening it.

3440
02:10:10,570 --> 02:10:10,650
Oh, my god.

3441
02:10:10,650 --> 02:10:10,710
Wait.

3442
02:10:11,090 --> 02:10:11,450
Wait.

3443
02:10:11,490 --> 02:10:12,450
I need to show my chat Woody.

3444
02:10:12,590 --> 02:10:12,870
Look it.

3445
02:10:12,870 --> 02:10:13,290
There's Woody.

3446
02:10:14,370 --> 02:10:16,090
There's Woody in Roblox.

3447
02:10:16,810 --> 02:10:17,390
I don't...

3448
02:10:17,390 --> 02:10:18,150
How do you get Woody?

3449
02:10:18,270 --> 02:10:18,550
Is this...

3450
02:10:18,550 --> 02:10:19,530
There's a fucking spider.

3451
02:10:19,770 --> 02:10:22,130
There's a Woody in my Roblox game.

3452
02:10:22,690 --> 02:10:23,450
Oh, my god.

3453
02:10:23,490 --> 02:10:24,730
This person is a fucking spider.

3454
02:10:24,850 --> 02:10:25,430
I've got like...

3455
02:10:25,430 --> 02:10:26,850
I've got a spider woman.

3456
02:10:27,010 --> 02:10:28,490
I've got a spider demon woman.

3457
02:10:28,850 --> 02:10:30,450
You've got a spider demon woman?

3458
02:10:30,450 --> 02:10:31,170
What in my room?

3459
02:10:32,450 --> 02:10:35,450
What the f- There's an anime boy!

3460
02:10:36,990 --> 02:10:39,710
Okay, wait, let me- I'm gonna mute my- I'm gonna mute myself.

3461
02:10:39,990 --> 02:10:43,310
So we can actually- Get in the game together!

3462
02:10:43,910 --> 02:10:44,270
Alright.

3463
02:10:45,330 --> 02:10:47,190
Okay, okay, okay, guys.

3464
02:10:48,130 --> 02:10:49,250
I'm gonna mute myself, guys.

3465
02:10:49,310 --> 02:10:50,730
We gotta make sure we get in the room together.

3466
02:10:50,790 --> 02:10:52,010
Give us a sec, chat.

3467
02:12:55,090 --> 02:12:57,490
We did it!

3468
02:12:57,530 --> 02:12:57,910
We did it!

3469
02:12:57,970 --> 02:12:58,450
We did it!

3470
02:12:58,590 --> 02:12:59,010
Guys!

3471
02:12:59,230 --> 02:13:01,210
It took us so many tries!

3472
02:13:01,470 --> 02:13:04,950
But there's f- Lightning McQueen!

3473
02:13:08,570 --> 02:13:10,010
This was worth it.

3474
02:13:10,370 --> 02:13:11,890
Guys, this was worth it.

3475
02:13:11,930 --> 02:13:13,830
We have Lightning McQueen, chat.

3476
02:13:14,250 --> 02:13:17,510
We have Lightning McQueen in our lobby.

3477
02:13:20,810 --> 02:13:21,570
Ka-chow!

3478
02:13:22,750 --> 02:13:23,930
Oh my god!

There he is!

3480
02:13:26,510 --> 02:13:27,990
There he is!

3481
02:13:28,070 --> 02:13:29,230
Oh my god!

3482
02:13:29,430 --> 02:13:31,090
I'm your biggest fan!

3483
02:13:31,370 --> 02:13:32,390
Mr. McQueen!

3484
02:13:35,030 --> 02:13:36,630
Are they on a roadblock state?

3485
02:13:37,330 --> 02:13:43,490
Okay, okay, so here's what- Here's- Here's- Here's natural disasters- Oh, we're in the- We're in the Spanish We're in the Spanish lobby.

3486
02:13:44,090 --> 02:13:45,870
It's acid- It's acid rain.

3487
02:13:45,970 --> 02:13:46,570
It's acid rain.

3488
02:13:46,690 --> 02:13:46,990
Oh no!

3489
02:13:47,130 --> 02:13:48,250

02:13:49,930 --> 02:13:50,310
Take shelter.

3492
02:13:50,810 --> 02:13:50,810
Lightning McQueen!

3493

Oh my god.

A natural disaster.

3496
02:13:55,890 --> 02:13:56,730
Lightning McQueen!

3497
02:13:56,790 --> 02:13:58,330
He's gotta- He's gotta get in the garage!

3498
02:13:58,730 --> 02:14:00,170
He knows how to play this game.

3499
02:14:00,370 --> 02:14:01,450
He's in the garage.

3500
02:14:01,610 --> 02:14:05,030
He has the exp- Bro, we're in the Spanish servers.

3501
02:14:05,530 --> 02:14:06,750
We're- Spanish?

3502
02:14:08,350 --> 02:14:11,690
Yeah, people are speaking- Everyone's speaking Spanish.

3503
02:14:12,230 --> 02:14:13,510
Hello, Mr. McQueen.

3504
02:14:13,570 --> 02:14:14,470
I'm your biggest fan.

3505
02:14:15,530 --> 02:14:18,830
I'm your biggest fan, McQueen.

3506
02:14:20,310 --> 02:14:20,750
McQueen.

3507
02:14:20,810 --> 02:14:22,270
It's really- It actually is.

3508
02:14:22,390 --> 02:14:22,770
Like, what?

3509
02:14:23,950 --> 02:14:32,770
I've bypassed the servers so far that I can't hold my That is Oh, yes.

3510
02:14:36,500 --> 02:14:38,810
Is that the other house next door?

3511
02:14:38,970 --> 02:14:41,070
He said kuchao.

3512
02:14:42,370 --> 02:14:43,770
What's kuchao?

3513
02:14:44,610 --> 02:14:47,810
Kuchao with a man screaming fire emoji.

3514
02:14:50,170 --> 02:14:51,030
That's him!

3515
02:14:51,130 --> 02:14:52,230
That's Lightning McQueen!

3516
02:14:52,870 --> 02:14:55,350
Is that actually the Spanish way to say it?

3517
02:14:55,650 --> 02:14:55,790
Kuchao!

3518
02:14:55,790 --> 02:14:57,390
Is that kuchao in Spanish?

3519
02:14:58,670 --> 02:14:58,930
...

3520
02:15:00,810 --> 02:15:02,110
Wait, it is?

3521
02:15:02,450 --> 02:15:03,850
Oh my god.

3522
02:15:04,130 --> 02:15:05,430
It is Spanish.

3523
02:15:08,170 --> 02:15:11,210
Somebody else repeated it and they were like kuchao?

3524
02:15:11,710 --> 02:15:17,710
Oh my god, did we get here?

3525
02:15:18,390 --> 02:15:19,550
Did you live?

3526
02:15:19,690 --> 02:15:20,570
Did you live?

3527
02:15:20,910 --> 02:15:21,290
Yeah, I did.

3528
02:15:22,030 --> 02:15:22,750
Here's a hack.

3529
02:15:22,910 --> 02:15:28,930
If your health is still injured before the next game starts, you gotta do a hard reset or else you're at an unfair disadvantage and you're missing HP.

3530
02:15:29,510 --> 02:15:29,990
Okay.

3531
02:15:31,410 --> 02:15:32,970
Blasting Roblox tech right here.

3532
02:15:33,230 --> 02:15:34,170
Oh my god.

3533
02:15:34,310 --> 02:15:35,270
I can't believe.

3534
02:15:35,570 --> 02:15:36,470
I can't believe.

3535
02:15:38,510 --> 02:15:43,870
I gotta figure out how to get this Lightning McQueen skin.

3536
02:15:43,990 --> 02:15:44,890
This is fucking fantastic.

3537
02:15:44,890 --> 02:15:46,330
Bro, this is a great skin.

3538
02:15:48,230 --> 02:15:48,670
Kuchao!

3539
02:15:49,250 --> 02:15:49,850
This is fucking Kuro.

3540
02:15:50,070 --> 02:15:52,010
This is a fucking Kuro cosplayer.

3541
02:15:52,170 --> 02:15:52,810
What the hell?

3542
02:15:53,410 --> 02:15:55,490
We got fucking VTubers in my instance.

3543
02:15:55,770 --> 02:15:57,590
I'm following Kuchao.

3544
02:15:58,630 --> 02:15:59,770
I trust him.

3545
02:15:59,830 --> 02:16:00,430
I trust him.

3546
02:16:00,530 --> 02:16:02,410
I trust Spanish Lightning McQueen.

3547
02:16:03,250 --> 02:16:05,790
This man fucking spent money on this.

3548
02:16:06,210 --> 02:16:09,270
Okay, there's a bit of a cloud front coming in.

3549
02:16:09,390 --> 02:16:11,270
I don't know what the disaster could be.

3550
02:16:11,390 --> 02:16:11,530
Is it fog?

3551
02:16:11,530 --> 02:16:13,250
Yeah, it looks like dense fog.

3552
02:16:13,890 --> 02:16:17,690
I'm on top of the ceiling to get a good purveying view of the game.

3553
02:16:17,710 --> 02:16:19,010
The situation here.

3554
02:16:19,810 --> 02:16:21,010
Back to you Dokie.

3555
02:16:21,930 --> 02:16:24,350
I'm with Spanish Lightning McQueen for an interview.

3556
02:16:24,490 --> 02:16:25,830
Oh, it's a fucking blizzard.

3557
02:16:26,150 --> 02:16:27,010
I'm an ish.

3558
02:16:27,190 --> 02:16:27,990
Oh no.

3559
02:16:28,430 --> 02:16:30,730
What do we do Mr McQueen?

3560
02:16:31,630 --> 02:16:33,330
You gotta run his engine.

3561
02:16:33,830 --> 02:16:35,150
Okay, I got it.

3562
02:16:35,230 --> 02:16:35,610
Stay warm.

3563
02:16:35,910 --> 02:16:36,410
We warm.

3564
02:16:36,650 --> 02:16:37,410
Huddle together guys.

3565
02:16:37,610 --> 02:16:38,750
Body heat, body heat.

3566
02:16:38,830 --> 02:16:39,810
Yeah, body heat, body heat.

3567
02:16:39,830 --> 02:16:43,310
Take off all your clothes and huddle up together.

3568
02:16:43,970 --> 02:16:45,010
Oh no...

3569
02:16:47,750 --> 02:16:50,630
Get inside McQueen for the heat!

3570
02:16:53,230 --> 02:16:55,490
We need the radiator!

3571
02:16:55,890 --> 02:16:56,910
What do you mean?

3572
02:17:02,750 --> 02:17:06,190
You think we're okay, Mr. McQueen?

3573
02:17:06,470 --> 02:17:07,110
Ka-chow!

3574
02:17:15,230 --> 02:17:17,130
Oh my god, ka-chow!

3575
02:17:19,990 --> 02:17:23,190
Oh my god, do you think we'll be okay, guys?

3576
02:17:23,370 --> 02:17:24,630
I can't even see my HP.

3577
02:17:25,090 --> 02:17:26,310
I can see McQueen's HP.

3578
02:17:26,310 --> 02:17:28,590
My HP is so low!

3579
02:17:28,710 --> 02:17:30,050
You're half HP!

3580
02:17:30,310 --> 02:17:32,650
Oh no, the walls are turning into snow!

3581
02:17:33,150 --> 02:17:34,750
Oh no, don't touch the snow!

3582
02:17:35,710 --> 02:17:36,250
Oh no!

3583
02:17:37,110 --> 02:17:37,710
Oh god!

3584
02:17:37,930 --> 02:17:39,670
Look at Smirk's face!

3585
02:17:39,850 --> 02:17:40,970
Ka-chow!

3586
02:17:41,230 --> 02:17:42,450
Ka-chow!

3587
02:17:42,810 --> 02:17:45,170
He's spelling it differently every time!

3588
02:17:46,090 --> 02:17:48,050
Oh, ka-chow!

3589
02:17:48,250 --> 02:17:49,290
Ka-chow!

3590
02:17:51,070 --> 02:17:54,490
I feel like we're a bunch of Pokemon!

3591
02:17:54,910 --> 02:17:55,730
I know!

3592
02:17:57,690 --> 02:18:00,350
Oh my god, he's a gamer.

3593
02:18:00,550 --> 02:18:02,750
Look at his HP, he's so high!

3594
02:18:02,830 --> 02:18:04,130
His HP is so high!

3595
02:18:04,590 --> 02:18:05,430
Oh god!

3596
02:18:05,550 --> 02:18:06,610
Okay, right, I gotta wipe.

3597
02:18:09,310 --> 02:18:11,150
How do you win this game?

3598
02:18:11,590 --> 02:18:13,010
You just have to survive!

3599
02:18:13,330 --> 02:18:16,830
You just get the highest points and survive as long as you can.

3600
02:18:19,410 --> 02:18:20,650
That's how you do it.

3601
02:18:21,670 --> 02:18:22,470
Surf Central.

3602
02:18:23,230 --> 02:18:25,870
Alright, I'm pretty sure I'm gonna die first before you.

3603
02:18:27,330 --> 02:18:29,290
Why didn't we get put into the world?

3604
02:18:29,490 --> 02:18:30,090
What the hell?

3605
02:18:31,210 --> 02:18:32,710
Even Ka-chow didn't go!

3606
02:18:32,950 --> 02:18:33,970
Oh my god, we didn't!

3607
02:18:34,010 --> 02:18:34,810
We're just too good.

3608
02:18:35,010 --> 02:18:36,330
You know, we're just too good.

3609
02:18:36,330 --> 02:18:37,250
We're on a win streak.

3610
02:18:37,510 --> 02:18:38,090
Yeah.

3611
02:18:39,230 --> 02:18:40,690
He's not happy!

3612
02:18:41,770 --> 02:18:45,230
Spanish Lady McQueen is not happy about this, look at him.

3613
02:18:46,010 --> 02:18:47,030
Oh god!

3614
02:18:47,570 --> 02:18:50,390
He's like, where was my game?

3615
02:18:50,630 --> 02:18:52,510
Where was my game?

3616
02:18:53,250 --> 02:18:56,230
Oh, there's a weather machine to power up?

3617
02:18:56,630 --> 02:18:57,730
Need a lift?

3618
02:18:57,910 --> 02:19:01,690
Just 30 robux to get a green balloon?

3619
02:19:03,010 --> 02:19:04,870
What the fuck is the green balloon?

3620
02:19:04,870 --> 02:19:06,810
Oh my god, I saw Woody with a green balloon.

3621
02:19:07,170 --> 02:19:07,330
Oh, that's cheating!

3622
02:19:07,510 --> 02:19:08,110
That's cheating!

3623
02:19:08,410 --> 02:19:09,430
It's like pay to win.

3624
02:19:09,710 --> 02:19:10,950
That's totally pay to win.

3625
02:19:11,190 --> 02:19:12,090
That's what I love to hear.

3626
02:19:12,210 --> 02:19:12,650
Classic.

3627
02:19:13,030 --> 02:19:14,110
No, no, no!

3628
02:19:14,430 --> 02:19:16,030
Avoid black crowds?

3629
02:19:16,090 --> 02:19:17,490
Wait, does that affect us?

3630
02:19:18,750 --> 02:19:23,030
No, no, no, because we're not part of the experiment down there.

3631
02:19:23,250 --> 02:19:23,750
Oh my god!

3632
02:19:23,750 --> 02:19:26,370
We can watch them like little ants scramble around.

3633
02:19:26,550 --> 02:19:27,230
Oh my god!

3634
02:19:27,590 --> 02:19:29,290
McQueen is getting squished!

3635
02:19:31,050 --> 02:19:32,250
He's so popular.

3636
02:19:32,270 --> 02:19:33,470
He's getting squished!

3637
02:19:33,470 --> 02:19:34,650
Koochow!

3638
02:19:34,850 --> 02:19:35,390
Koochow!

3639
02:19:37,510 --> 02:19:38,870
What happened to him?

3640
02:19:39,090 --> 02:19:39,750
Oh my god!

3641
02:19:39,970 --> 02:19:40,350
He's...

3642
02:19:40,350 --> 02:19:42,530
Wait, do your emote!

3643
02:19:42,570 --> 02:19:43,510
How do you do your emote?

3644
02:19:43,530 --> 02:19:43,830
Period?

3645
02:19:43,970 --> 02:19:44,650
Oh, period, yes.

3646
02:19:44,730 --> 02:19:45,050
Period.

3647
02:19:45,050 --> 02:19:46,450
And then... here.

3648
02:19:46,650 --> 02:19:47,870
That's my emote.

3649
02:19:55,990 --> 02:19:56,590
Koochow!

3650
02:20:00,290 --> 02:20:02,790
He's both shivering and warm.

3651
02:20:02,790 --> 02:20:05,170
I don't know what emotion this conveys.

3652
02:20:07,030 --> 02:20:08,650
Does someone just call him dad?

3653
02:20:08,650 --> 02:20:10,030
He really likes this girl.

3654
02:20:10,130 --> 02:20:11,790
He's like driving onto her.

3655
02:20:12,230 --> 02:20:12,970
Oh no!

3656
02:20:16,470 --> 02:20:17,110
McQueen!

3657
02:20:17,190 --> 02:20:17,830
Stop!

3658
02:20:18,130 --> 02:20:20,170
Your career, McQueen!

3659
02:20:20,770 --> 02:20:22,850
McQueen, you can't be seen like this!

3660
02:20:22,890 --> 02:20:23,630
You have a wife!

3661
02:20:23,630 --> 02:20:26,590
You have a wife and your best friend!

3662
02:20:27,470 --> 02:20:28,010
This is a Porsche!

3663
02:20:30,490 --> 02:20:31,710
Oh my god.

3664
02:20:31,710 --> 02:20:31,930
Why?

3665
02:20:31,930 --> 02:20:34,530
How could you do this in front of all of us?

3666
02:20:35,010 --> 02:20:36,490
Literally, you're our hero!

3667
02:20:37,970 --> 02:20:41,090
I think Spanish McQueen has like different standards.

3668
02:20:41,690 --> 02:20:43,670
Dude, we still won.

3669
02:20:43,970 --> 02:20:45,410
That counted as a win for us.

3670
02:20:45,410 --> 02:20:46,390
Yeah, we're just gamers.

3671
02:20:48,510 --> 02:20:51,810
Did he just post an emote of an amoeba?

3672
02:20:52,030 --> 02:20:53,630
What the fuck is that emote?

3673
02:20:53,770 --> 02:20:57,090
What is that emote?

3674
02:21:00,890 --> 02:21:02,310
Level 4 weather?

3675
02:21:02,530 --> 02:21:03,250
Level 4?

3676
02:21:03,250 --> 02:21:03,490
Level 4?

3677
02:21:03,850 --> 02:21:05,670
There's like one person down there.

3678
02:21:06,110 --> 02:21:07,530
What the fuck is that word?

3679
02:21:08,570 --> 02:21:08,790
Classic.

3680
02:21:09,170 --> 02:21:10,150
Are you gonna get on the rocket?

3681
02:21:10,450 --> 02:21:11,050
There's a rocket?

3682
02:21:12,250 --> 02:21:14,450
Wait, is this the only person playing the game?

3683
02:21:14,590 --> 02:21:16,190
We did it.

3684
02:21:16,850 --> 02:21:17,810
Powered by...

3685
02:21:19,410 --> 02:21:20,910
There's four natural disasters.

3686
02:21:21,470 --> 02:21:22,890
FIVE natural disasters?

3687
02:21:25,110 --> 02:21:25,830
Good job.

3688
02:21:26,770 --> 02:21:28,570
Wait, wait, wait...

3689
02:21:30,530 --> 02:21:32,450
I think we have to go up.

3690
02:21:33,270 --> 02:21:34,890
We need to leave the planet.

3691
02:21:34,930 --> 02:21:35,790
I think that's the result.

3692
02:21:36,550 --> 02:21:40,970
I've never seen somebody pay that much to have five natural disasters.

3693
02:21:41,210 --> 02:21:42,770
That's like... we're gonna die!

3694
02:21:43,310 --> 02:21:45,130
How did you get in the rocket?

3695
02:21:45,610 --> 02:21:46,830
Oh no!

3696
02:21:47,050 --> 02:21:50,490
Did they knock down the platform to cross into it?

3697
02:21:50,610 --> 02:21:51,490
You gotta climb the...

3698
02:21:51,490 --> 02:21:54,470
No, they knocked down the platform to get into the thing.

3699
02:21:54,710 --> 02:21:55,170
They did?

3700
02:21:55,550 --> 02:21:56,630
Those monsters!

3701
02:21:57,530 --> 02:21:57,890
Kill them.

3702
02:21:58,650 --> 02:21:59,590
Are we dead?

3703
02:21:59,690 --> 02:22:01,390
Enable the rocket.

3704
02:22:02,330 --> 02:22:03,190
Volcanic eruption.

3705
02:22:03,230 --> 02:22:03,730
Fire.

3706
02:22:03,930 --> 02:22:04,430
Thunderstorm.

3707
02:22:04,630 --> 02:22:04,650
Oh my god!

3708
02:22:04,870 --> 02:22:05,510
Thunderstorm!

3709
02:22:07,190 --> 02:22:07,830
Guys!

3710
02:22:08,170 --> 02:22:08,930
Put her down!

3711
02:22:10,950 --> 02:22:12,110
Oh my god!

3712
02:22:12,130 --> 02:22:12,470
Is that okay?

3713
02:22:13,530 --> 02:22:14,810
I can't tell.

3714
02:22:14,930 --> 02:22:15,790
Oh, I'm so scared.

3715
02:22:16,210 --> 02:22:17,610
Oh, I'm so scared.

3716
02:22:18,730 --> 02:22:19,610
There's fire!

3717
02:22:21,630 --> 02:22:22,970
Are you in the rocket?

3718
02:22:24,450 --> 02:22:25,370
It's a tower!

3719
02:22:25,670 --> 02:22:26,890
It's a flash flood!

3720
02:22:26,930 --> 02:22:30,390
That tower is getting destroyed by lava!

3721
02:22:31,750 --> 02:22:32,310
Flood!

3722
02:22:32,350 --> 02:22:32,910
Oh!

3723
02:22:34,690 --> 02:22:36,330
I'm on the rocket!

3724
02:22:38,950 --> 02:22:39,730
I'm dead.

3725
02:22:40,990 --> 02:22:42,790
Bro, no one's surviving that.

3726
02:22:43,370 --> 02:22:45,190
I was so fucked up.

3727
02:22:45,290 --> 02:22:48,110
Bro, no one's fucking surviving that.

3728
02:22:48,190 --> 02:22:49,330
Holy shit.

3729
02:22:50,190 --> 02:22:53,530
I like that you can just pay money to instantly kill people.

3730
02:22:53,690 --> 02:22:53,950
Yeah!

3731
02:22:54,090 --> 02:22:56,250
Just put them through the worst experience of their life.

3732
02:22:56,510 --> 02:22:56,710
So level five.

3733
02:22:57,790 --> 02:22:58,910
Nobody lived.

3734
02:22:59,770 --> 02:23:01,250
Nobody fucking lived.

3735
02:23:02,390 --> 02:23:03,250
Thank you.

3736
02:23:03,250 --> 02:23:07,910
Thank you, cool2x, for like, literally ending our lives.

3737
02:23:08,050 --> 02:23:09,250
For like, pay to end.

3738
02:23:09,590 --> 02:23:10,630
Pay to end.

3739
02:23:12,370 --> 02:23:13,430
Forget pay to win.

3740
02:23:13,490 --> 02:23:13,910
Pay to end.

3741
02:23:14,010 --> 02:23:14,610
That was a fun game, though.

3742
02:23:14,750 --> 02:23:15,930
Pay to end them all, yeah.

3743
02:23:16,770 --> 02:23:18,130
This game is really addicting.

3744
02:23:18,230 --> 02:23:18,990
It's good fun.

3745
02:23:19,090 --> 02:23:19,590
It's just art.

3746
02:23:19,630 --> 02:23:22,310
And it's just funny map and, you know, just silly survival.

3747
02:23:23,090 --> 02:23:25,130
Oh no, I think Lightning McQueen left.

3748
02:23:25,350 --> 02:23:27,950
No, no, he's at the bottom floor, contemplating life.

3749
02:23:27,950 --> 02:23:29,510
He's fighting with a dog.

3750
02:23:29,690 --> 02:23:31,910
Yeah, he's fighting with a dog right here.

3751
02:23:31,990 --> 02:23:33,790
With mentally unwell.

3752
02:23:34,190 --> 02:23:35,470
Mentally unwell?

3753
02:23:35,790 --> 02:23:38,010
Oh, okay, but having an ass in my name is a bad moment.

3754
02:23:39,210 --> 02:23:41,490
Lightning is running away from the dog.

3755
02:23:41,730 --> 02:23:42,210
Ciao.

3756
02:23:42,210 --> 02:23:45,430
He's running away from his problems.

3757
02:23:45,650 --> 02:23:46,950
He's running away.

3758
02:23:47,290 --> 02:23:49,130
Just like the first movie, guys.

3759
02:23:49,950 --> 02:23:51,590
There were no survivors.

3760
02:23:56,430 --> 02:23:57,270
Damn, really?

3761
02:23:57,450 --> 02:23:57,930
No survivors?

3762
02:23:57,930 --> 02:24:00,250
I wonder why.

3763
02:24:00,870 --> 02:24:01,690
I'm fucked up.

3764
02:24:01,750 --> 02:24:03,850
I like the volcano right next to the planet, too.

3765
02:24:04,590 --> 02:24:05,310
Alright, Snuffy.

3766
02:24:05,530 --> 02:24:06,750
Give us another server.

3767
02:24:07,510 --> 02:24:08,210
Another server?

3768
02:24:08,450 --> 02:24:09,090
Alright, alright, alright.

3769
02:24:09,270 --> 02:24:10,410
Let's find a new game.

3770
02:24:10,550 --> 02:24:11,330
That one's a good one.

3771
02:24:11,370 --> 02:24:12,130
A classic one.

3772
02:24:12,370 --> 02:24:12,550
That one was good, yeah.

3773
02:24:13,730 --> 02:24:16,150
It's one of the oldest games, like, on Roblox.

3774
02:24:16,210 --> 02:24:18,470
Like, I think that thing is probably more than 10 years old.

3775
02:24:18,530 --> 02:24:18,630
Wait, really?

3776
02:24:18,630 --> 02:24:22,310
I don't know if there's a way to, like, look when it got posted or something, but yeah, that thing is...

3777
02:24:22,810 --> 02:24:23,870
That is a relic.

3778
02:24:24,730 --> 02:24:27,390
Created March 28th, 2000.

3779
02:24:27,550 --> 02:24:27,910
That's crazy.

3780
02:24:27,930 --> 02:24:28,610
2008.

3781
02:24:29,050 --> 02:24:34,210
Holy... the person... this stick master, Luke, has made so much money.

3782
02:24:34,350 --> 02:24:35,070
Oh, yeah.

3783
02:24:35,830 --> 02:24:37,850
That is... that was a big one.

3784
02:24:38,010 --> 02:24:39,850
You know, the biggest brain?

3785
02:24:40,050 --> 02:24:40,870
Oh my god.

3786
02:24:41,410 --> 02:24:44,930
You make your own Roblox world, and then make your...

3787
02:24:45,950 --> 02:24:48,350
Make your own Roblox world.

3788
02:24:48,830 --> 02:24:49,270
Make your own Roblox world.

3789
02:24:49,270 --> 02:24:49,790
And then...

3790
02:24:49,790 --> 02:24:51,490
And ironically, have that idea.

3791
02:24:51,590 --> 02:24:54,150
Put cosmetics in there so people will have to spend Robux.

3792
02:24:54,710 --> 02:25:01,770
You could hire somebody, like, like a game dev in Roblox to make a game for you, and then you can just, like, get rich from microtransactions.

3793
02:25:01,990 --> 02:25:02,550
Oh, yeah.

3794
02:25:02,550 --> 02:25:03,570
We're gonna farm children.

3795
02:25:03,830 --> 02:25:04,930
That's so ethically right.

3796
02:25:04,970 --> 02:25:10,410
The target section, the target children's toy section is just riddled with, like, off-brand Roblox games.

3797
02:25:10,470 --> 02:25:19,470
That, like, Roblox creators got, like, money from their game, and then they just want to make that same game as, like, a standalone and just keep getting money from it.

3798
02:25:19,550 --> 02:25:22,930
Like, the big one is called, like, Pet Simulator or something right now.

3799
02:25:22,930 --> 02:25:24,750
Pet Sim... oh, wait, I've seen that before!

3800
02:25:24,950 --> 02:25:25,150
Yeah!

3801
02:25:25,150 --> 02:25:25,790
Yep.

3802
02:25:25,790 --> 02:25:26,270
Yep.

3803
02:25:26,870 --> 02:25:28,010
It's fucking crazy.

3804
02:25:28,190 --> 02:25:29,850
There's so much drama regarding it, too.

3805
02:25:29,890 --> 02:25:30,290
It's insane.

3806
02:25:30,590 --> 02:25:33,570
Um, okay, so I think another good one...

3807
02:25:33,570 --> 02:25:35,130
Hmm... what are you feeling?

3808
02:25:35,170 --> 02:25:36,330
We can do another roleplay.

3809
02:25:36,390 --> 02:25:38,690
We can do kind of a never-before-seen experience.

3810
02:25:39,190 --> 02:25:41,170
Let's try the never-before-seen experience.

3811
02:25:41,610 --> 02:25:43,930
Let's, like, try all different experiences here.

3812
02:25:44,470 --> 02:25:45,150
Yeah, yeah.

3813
02:25:45,170 --> 02:25:46,450
Get the full Roblox...

3814
02:25:47,210 --> 02:25:47,930
Roblox style.

3815
02:25:48,850 --> 02:25:49,330
Okay.

3816
02:25:51,190 --> 02:25:54,510
Let me, let me, let me peruse what I've got saved here so far.

3817
02:25:55,750 --> 02:25:57,130
I'm gonna change my face.

3818
02:25:58,510 --> 02:25:59,130
Oh my god.

3819
02:25:59,370 --> 02:26:00,810
This might be an interesting one.

3820
02:26:00,870 --> 02:26:04,970
I've never been to this one, but it is a it is a official sponsor one.

3821
02:26:05,230 --> 02:26:05,530
Oh!

3822
02:26:06,290 --> 02:26:06,910
What's it called?

3823
02:26:07,190 --> 02:26:09,650
Oh, wait, we shouldn't say it, so then we could actually... I linked you, yeah.

3824
02:26:09,750 --> 02:26:11,070
Yeah, I was gonna say we shouldn't say it.

3825
02:26:11,070 --> 02:26:14,390
You can let me know if this is, like, something you'd wanna, you'd wanna, like, do that.

3826
02:26:14,490 --> 02:26:14,950
Oh, wait!

3827
02:26:15,110 --> 02:26:15,470
Yes!

3828
02:26:16,090 --> 02:26:16,450
Yes!

3829
02:26:16,550 --> 02:26:16,910
Yeah?

3830
02:26:16,930 --> 02:26:17,170
Yeah?

3831
02:26:18,170 --> 02:26:18,810
Okay, okay.

3832
02:26:21,050 --> 02:26:22,670
I'm opening, I'm opening it.

3833
02:26:26,170 --> 02:26:26,890
Oh my gosh.

3834
02:26:26,990 --> 02:26:27,310
Yes.

3835
02:26:27,750 --> 02:26:28,730
I've never done this one.

3836
02:26:28,750 --> 02:26:30,490
So I'll be new to it as well.

3837
02:26:30,570 --> 02:26:31,050
Oh my god.

3838
02:26:31,070 --> 02:26:32,350
It's a fucking tycoon.

3839
02:26:32,550 --> 02:26:34,010
It's one of those games.

3840
02:26:34,010 --> 02:26:34,710
Tycoon games?

3841
02:26:34,830 --> 02:26:35,650
Oh my god.

3842
02:26:35,710 --> 02:26:36,170
It's a tycoon game.

3843
02:26:37,930 --> 02:26:39,170
Oh my god.

3844
02:26:39,190 --> 02:26:40,210
It's so cute!

3845
02:26:42,270 --> 02:26:44,290
Would you like a quick walkthrough?

3846
02:26:45,150 --> 02:26:45,590
Sure.

3847
02:26:48,860 --> 02:26:49,760
Oh my god.

3848
02:26:49,880 --> 02:26:51,240
Wait, I'm gonna join you first.

3849
02:26:51,940 --> 02:26:53,260
Let me know when you're in the server.

3850
02:26:53,900 --> 02:26:54,680
I'm in, I'm in.

3851
02:26:55,100 --> 02:26:55,820
Okay, I'm gonna...

3852
02:26:55,820 --> 02:26:57,060
Are you sure you wanna leave the experience?

3853
02:26:57,400 --> 02:26:58,060
Yes, sadly.

3854
02:26:59,140 --> 02:27:00,560
Sadly, I have to.

3855
02:27:01,140 --> 02:27:01,480
Sadly, I have to.

3856
02:27:01,480 --> 02:27:05,720
One of my other favorite, like, official sponsors is in, like, one of the Roleplay Town worlds.

3857
02:27:05,760 --> 02:27:06,100
One of my other favorite, like, official sponsors is in, like, one of the Roleplay Town worlds.

3858
02:27:06,100 --> 02:27:07,860
Is, like, a canonical, like, Home Depot.

3859
02:27:08,040 --> 02:27:09,700
Like, a real sponsor for Home Depot.

3860
02:27:09,720 --> 02:27:09,720
What?

3861
02:27:09,720 --> 02:27:12,400
Home Depot has a fucking Roblox server?

3862
02:27:13,380 --> 02:27:20,300
Yeah, they have, like, in one of the Roleplay Towns, Yeah, they have, like, in one of the Roleplay Towns, they have, like, an official, like, building where you can load in and, like, have, like, sponsored...

3863
02:27:20,300 --> 02:27:21,540
Home Depot content!

3864
02:27:21,800 --> 02:27:22,160
Oh my god!

3865
02:27:22,280 --> 02:27:24,340
Also, you have to rejoin the server, cause I think they...

3866
02:27:24,880 --> 02:27:26,380
You got sniped.

3867
02:27:26,380 --> 02:27:28,240
I don't know, this one might...

3868
02:27:28,240 --> 02:27:29,920
be a single player game.

3869
02:27:29,980 --> 02:27:31,040
It's a single player?

3870
02:27:31,520 --> 02:27:31,800
No!

3871
02:27:31,800 --> 02:27:32,800
It could be, it could be.

3872
02:27:32,840 --> 02:27:34,200
Some of them are, some of them are.

3873
02:27:34,360 --> 02:27:34,940
I don't know.

3874
02:27:35,380 --> 02:27:35,380
Nooo!

3875
02:27:36,220 --> 02:27:37,200
How can... How else will you join?

3876
02:27:37,200 --> 02:27:38,820
Okay, I loaded into another one.

3877
02:27:39,000 --> 02:27:40,980
How else will you join my tycoon?

3878
02:27:42,140 --> 02:27:43,300
Oh, I think it is.

3879
02:27:43,440 --> 02:27:44,240
This server does not...

3880
02:27:44,240 --> 02:27:46,440
This experience does not support private servers.

3881
02:27:46,700 --> 02:27:46,980
Oh, yeah.

3882
02:27:46,980 --> 02:27:48,500
Alright, guys, I'll show you what it looks like.

3883
02:27:48,600 --> 02:27:50,140
And then we're gonna find another server.

3884
02:27:50,900 --> 02:27:51,260
Chat.

3885
02:27:51,420 --> 02:27:52,560
I'll show you what we joined.

3886
02:27:52,700 --> 02:27:54,560
I'm pretty sure you saw it from Snuffy's side.

3887
02:27:54,800 --> 02:27:56,320
But, like... No, I didn't saw it.

3888
02:27:56,360 --> 02:27:56,360
But, like...

3889
02:27:56,360 --> 02:27:56,360
No, I didn't saw it.

3890
02:27:56,380 --> 02:27:57,040
I didn't saw it.

3891
02:27:57,120 --> 02:27:57,120
Oh, okay.

3892
02:27:57,340 --> 02:27:58,180
Guys, look.

3893
02:27:58,320 --> 02:28:01,380
Look, it's the Hello Kitty experience.

3894
02:28:02,560 --> 02:28:03,140
Look.

3895
02:28:03,140 --> 02:28:03,920
Look, it's the Hello Kitty experience.

3896
02:28:04,080 --> 02:28:05,040
There's Tsunomoro!

3897
02:28:06,420 --> 02:28:07,860
Hi, it's a pleasure.

3898
02:28:08,060 --> 02:28:09,240
Welcome, Hello Kitty!

3899
02:28:11,400 --> 02:28:12,680
Oh my god!

3900
02:28:13,300 --> 02:28:13,320
Oh my god!

3901
02:28:15,940 --> 02:28:16,900
Look at this!

3902
02:28:17,880 --> 02:28:20,060
There's gotcha... Of course, there's fucking gotcha.

3903
02:28:21,120 --> 02:28:22,280
There's gotcha.

3904
02:28:23,280 --> 02:28:23,860
Tsunomoro!

3905
02:28:25,240 --> 02:28:26,260
Where's Tsunomoro?

3906
02:28:27,740 --> 02:28:28,900
I don't wanna do all of this.

3907
02:28:28,940 --> 02:28:30,320
I just wanna talk to Tsunomoro.

3908
02:28:31,720 --> 02:28:32,600
I don't wanna do all of this.

3909
02:28:32,600 --> 02:28:32,600
I just wanna talk to Tsunomoro.

3910
02:28:32,600 --> 02:28:33,120
Alright, I'm done.

3911
02:28:33,440 --> 02:28:34,580
I've had my experience.

3912
02:28:34,940 --> 02:28:36,060
It's like that Hello Kitty...

3913
02:28:36,060 --> 02:28:38,000
What's that Hello Kitty game that South Park advertised?

3914
02:28:38,680 --> 02:28:40,180
Hello Kitty Adventures?

3915
02:28:41,840 --> 02:28:42,680
Is that it?

3916
02:28:42,980 --> 02:28:43,680
Oh, oh!

3917
02:28:43,700 --> 02:28:44,880
Hello Kitty Island Adventures?

3918
02:28:45,120 --> 02:28:45,440
Yes!

3919
02:28:45,720 --> 02:28:49,160
It's basically like the free version of Hello Kitty Island Adventures.

3920
02:28:49,520 --> 02:28:50,160
It is!

3921
02:28:50,480 --> 02:28:51,880
It's actually... It's still a free game.

3922
02:28:51,980 --> 02:28:52,880
I have it on my iPhone.

3923
02:28:53,040 --> 02:28:57,340
If you have like a iPod... Apple device, it's free on the Apple Arcade.

3924
02:28:57,460 --> 02:28:58,520
Oh, whoa!

3925
02:29:00,080 --> 02:29:04,500
Not sponsored, by the way, but if Hello Kitty Island Adventure would like to sponsor me...

3926
02:29:05,340 --> 02:29:06,520
I'm right here!

3927
02:29:07,260 --> 02:29:07,700
Absolutely!

3928
02:29:08,280 --> 02:29:09,260
It's very neat.

3929
02:29:09,440 --> 02:29:10,280
I'm right here!

3930
02:29:11,100 --> 02:29:12,700
I've never played this one.

3931
02:29:12,800 --> 02:29:13,880
I linked you a new one.

3932
02:29:13,980 --> 02:29:16,040
I've never played it, but it looks appetizing.

3933
02:29:16,120 --> 02:29:16,800
It looks very entertaining.

3934
02:29:16,800 --> 02:29:17,840
I'm gonna join off of you.

3935
02:29:17,900 --> 02:29:18,400
Give me a sec.

3936
02:29:18,540 --> 02:29:18,980
I'm gonna leave.

3937
02:29:22,320 --> 02:29:26,280
I can't believe Hello Kitty Island Adventure didn't win Game of the Year.

3938
02:29:26,500 --> 02:29:26,920
There you go.

3939
02:29:27,020 --> 02:29:28,040
It's so fucking robbed.

3940
02:29:28,660 --> 02:29:29,520
I know!

3941
02:29:29,680 --> 02:29:30,060
I know!

3942
02:29:30,100 --> 02:29:30,980
I was so sad.

3943
02:29:33,100 --> 02:29:35,620
That should have been best mobile game!

3944
02:29:36,480 --> 02:29:37,960
What the fuck is this?

3945
02:29:38,100 --> 02:29:40,460
Let's try to find foods hiding in the house.

3946
02:29:41,740 --> 02:29:42,600
This is us.

3947
02:29:44,260 --> 02:29:45,680
I'm not even in your server.

3948
02:29:46,500 --> 02:29:47,460
What the fuck?

3949
02:29:47,480 --> 02:29:48,000
Where are we?

3950
02:29:49,520 --> 02:29:51,960
What the fuck is this?

3951
02:29:55,060 --> 02:29:55,600
Okay.

3952
02:29:57,140 --> 02:29:58,260
What are we trying to do?

3953
02:29:58,800 --> 02:30:01,420
I think it said you have to hide or something.

3954
02:30:01,780 --> 02:30:03,000
Or find food.

3955
02:30:03,220 --> 02:30:03,880
I don't...

3956
02:30:05,120 --> 02:30:05,640
Wooo!

3957
02:30:06,120 --> 02:30:06,640
Wooo!

3958
02:30:09,800 --> 02:30:12,220
I don't see like an enemy anywhere.

3959
02:30:13,240 --> 02:30:13,760
Speedfest.

3960
02:30:14,080 --> 02:30:15,140
Yeah, who's the enemy?

3961
02:30:16,260 --> 02:30:16,780
Wooo!

3962
02:30:17,640 --> 02:30:18,160
Wooo!

3963
02:30:18,160 --> 02:30:19,200
Oh my god, they're so tiny!

3964
02:30:21,060 --> 02:30:22,340
How are they so tiny?

3965
02:30:24,340 --> 02:30:24,860
Wooo!

3966
02:30:24,860 --> 02:30:25,420
I fell down.

3967
02:30:25,420 --> 02:30:25,920
Wooo!

3968
02:30:29,980 --> 02:30:30,860
There's a chef?

3969
02:30:30,980 --> 02:30:31,760
But where's the chef?

3970
02:30:32,320 --> 02:30:33,140
A chef?

3971
02:30:33,440 --> 02:30:35,200
Yeah, apparently there's a chef somewhere.

3972
02:30:37,360 --> 02:30:38,400
I can't get out.

3973
02:30:38,580 --> 02:30:39,680
I can't get out.

3974
02:30:39,840 --> 02:30:40,140
I'm scared.

3975
02:30:40,140 --> 02:30:40,680
I'm stuck.

3976
02:30:41,460 --> 02:30:47,000
I'm gonna like hide under... I'm gonna be like a food that you dropped and that you haven't like seen under the fridge for 10 years.

3977
02:30:47,180 --> 02:30:47,200
Oh, that's true.

3978
02:30:47,200 --> 02:30:47,500
Me too.

3979
02:30:47,600 --> 02:30:48,880
I'm under the chair.

3980
02:30:49,660 --> 02:30:50,940
There's no way they'll find me.

3981
02:30:51,380 --> 02:30:52,620
I'm going to the fridge.

3982
02:30:52,880 --> 02:30:54,840
Oh, apparently he's gonna spawn or something.

3983
02:30:55,260 --> 02:30:57,520
Oh yeah, so it's like prop hunt.

3984
02:30:57,660 --> 02:30:59,460
Oh, I'm not big enough to go under the fridge.

3985
02:30:59,620 --> 02:30:59,920
Wait, I can be a pizza!

3986
02:31:02,060 --> 02:31:03,900
Wait, how do you change?

3987
02:31:03,960 --> 02:31:04,400
How do you change?

3988
02:31:04,720 --> 02:31:05,560
I don't know, but...

3989
02:31:06,140 --> 02:31:07,320
Wait, I can be pizza!

3990
02:31:07,380 --> 02:31:08,640
I found a pizza!

3991
02:31:09,620 --> 02:31:10,600
I'm here now.

3992
02:31:10,920 --> 02:31:11,560
I'm pizza.

3993
02:31:11,840 --> 02:31:12,120
Wait.

3994
02:31:12,220 --> 02:31:12,960
You're pizza?

3995
02:31:13,260 --> 02:31:13,620
I'm pizza.

3996
02:31:14,800 --> 02:31:16,320
I found a pizza.

3997
02:31:18,760 --> 02:31:19,460
Oh, bread?

3998
02:31:19,500 --> 02:31:23,460
These are really good graphics for fucking Roblox, not gonna lie.

3999
02:31:23,640 --> 02:31:24,560
There's a strawberry!

4000
02:31:25,780 --> 02:31:26,860
Oh my god, I'm bread.

4001
02:31:27,720 --> 02:31:29,420
Oh my god, bread is so cute.

4002
02:31:29,480 --> 02:31:29,940
Get over here.

4003
02:31:31,600 --> 02:31:34,200
I'm gonna be under... there's no way people are gonna find me.

4004
02:31:34,320 --> 02:31:40,060
Guys, if we're all in the fucking same place, the chef's gonna know we're not...

4005
02:31:40,060 --> 02:31:42,340
I belong here.

4006
02:31:42,480 --> 02:31:43,860
I belong here too.

4007
02:31:45,760 --> 02:31:46,960
I belong here too.

4008
02:31:47,580 --> 02:31:48,180
Wait, wait.

4009
02:31:48,220 --> 02:31:49,100
Let me get on top.

4010
02:31:49,220 --> 02:31:51,560
Let me stack up.

4011
02:31:52,060 --> 02:31:53,500
This is a cursed sandwich.

4012
02:31:53,700 --> 02:31:54,020
Okay, wait.

4013
02:31:54,080 --> 02:31:54,800
Lie down.

4014
02:31:54,800 --> 02:31:55,460
Okay.

4015
02:31:56,700 --> 02:31:57,440
Okay, wait.

4016
02:31:57,480 --> 02:31:58,440
Let me move up.

4017
02:31:58,600 --> 02:32:00,220
There's no way they'll know.

4018
02:32:02,640 --> 02:32:03,560
We're pizza.

4019
02:32:03,700 --> 02:32:06,080
Wait, what is that guy named Urinary Trash?

4020
02:32:08,180 --> 02:32:09,220
There we go.

4021
02:32:09,700 --> 02:32:10,580
It's perfect!

4022
02:32:10,980 --> 02:32:12,000
They'll never know!

4023
02:32:12,620 --> 02:32:16,500
Guys, if there's 20 apples under here, it's gonna look weird.

4024
02:32:16,540 --> 02:32:19,220
If there's 20 apples down here.

4025
02:32:19,240 --> 02:32:20,760
Maybe it'll buy us time.

4026
02:32:20,840 --> 02:32:24,120
We'll reach for all the apples and we're in the very far back.

4027
02:32:24,360 --> 02:32:25,140
We're hiding.

4028
02:32:25,360 --> 02:32:26,280
Oh my god, there's a croissant.

4029
02:32:26,400 --> 02:32:27,520
Where the fuck's the chef?

4030
02:32:28,600 --> 02:32:29,840
Like, what is...

4031
02:32:29,840 --> 02:32:31,100
Why is there not a chef?

4032
02:32:31,160 --> 02:32:31,600
What am I...

4033
02:32:31,600 --> 02:32:33,560
What's the game plan here?

4034
02:32:33,600 --> 02:32:33,980
Are we just food?

4035
02:32:33,980 --> 02:32:34,320
Did he die?

4036
02:32:34,600 --> 02:32:35,320
Is this it?

4037
02:32:36,140 --> 02:32:37,080
Hide and seek.

4038
02:32:37,140 --> 02:32:38,120
He is too sm...

4039
02:32:38,120 --> 02:32:39,420
What does that mean?

4040
02:32:39,500 --> 02:32:40,440
He is too sm...

4041
02:32:40,960 --> 02:32:42,040
Where's the chef?

4042
02:32:44,420 --> 02:32:47,340
How are we supposed to get found if there's nothing to find?

4043
02:32:49,360 --> 02:32:50,920
Maybe it's just a round.

4044
02:32:51,060 --> 02:32:52,260
Is there like a timer?

4045
02:32:52,480 --> 02:32:52,840
Somewhere?

4046
02:32:53,780 --> 02:32:56,380
I feel like we've been walking around for a while.

4047
02:32:56,560 --> 02:32:57,280
We need to go fast.

4048
02:32:58,140 --> 02:33:00,380
Give me over... Oh my gosh, I'm so fucking slow.

4049
02:33:00,500 --> 02:33:03,280
My legs can't fucking handle this dumpy.

4050
02:33:05,860 --> 02:33:06,340
Weeeew.

4051
02:33:06,340 --> 02:33:06,820
Weeeew.

4052
02:33:06,920 --> 02:33:07,200
Weeeew.

4053
02:33:09,460 --> 02:33:09,940
Weeeew.

4054
02:33:09,960 --> 02:33:12,620
Oh, I found the pizza under the couch.

4055
02:33:12,740 --> 02:33:13,420
Yeah, yeah, that was me.

4056
02:33:14,400 --> 02:33:15,940
I am so fucking slow.

4057
02:33:17,660 --> 02:33:18,680
Where's the chef?

4058
02:33:18,860 --> 02:33:20,200
Who are we hiding from?

4059
02:33:20,680 --> 02:33:21,420
I'm just gonna...

4060
02:33:23,560 --> 02:33:24,760
There's like so...

4061
02:33:24,760 --> 02:33:26,420
so many things here.

4062
02:33:26,620 --> 02:33:27,800
It's just... there's a me.

4063
02:33:28,540 --> 02:33:30,120
Oh, there's a whole other room.

4064
02:33:30,200 --> 02:33:31,280
Maybe he's in another room.

4065
02:33:31,620 --> 02:33:33,860
Are we trying to find the fucking chef?

4066
02:33:33,960 --> 02:33:35,120
Is that what's happening?

4067
02:33:35,480 --> 02:33:37,840
I'm gonna find him myself and get cooked for you at the least.

4068
02:33:37,840 --> 02:33:39,280
Yeah, at this point I'll find the chef.

4069
02:33:39,780 --> 02:33:41,060
Who's Crumpet?

4070
02:33:41,060 --> 02:33:42,180
Where's your face?

4071
02:33:42,800 --> 02:33:43,340
Crumpet?

4072
02:33:44,230 --> 02:33:44,880
Oh my god.

4073
02:33:46,560 --> 02:33:47,820
There's a baguette?

4074
02:33:49,320 --> 02:33:50,280
What is this?

4075
02:33:50,680 --> 02:33:51,740
I'm in the bathtub.

4076
02:33:51,740 --> 02:33:52,160
Coming soon.

4077
02:33:53,840 --> 02:33:55,460
How'd you guys get up there in the bathtub?

4078
02:33:55,460 --> 02:33:56,240
Oh, wait.

4079
02:33:56,360 --> 02:33:58,820
Is it just us finding other hidden items?

4080
02:33:59,020 --> 02:34:00,200
Is this the game?

4081
02:34:00,940 --> 02:34:01,840
That's the game.

4082
02:34:01,900 --> 02:34:03,080
It's just finding the food.

4083
02:34:03,120 --> 02:34:05,020
That's just finding the food.

4084
02:34:06,420 --> 02:34:07,380
But it's adorable.

4085
02:34:08,000 --> 02:34:08,840
I kinda love it.

4086
02:34:09,220 --> 02:34:09,500
Mmmmm.

4087
02:34:14,460 --> 02:34:14,980
No,

4088
02:34:18,280 --> 02:34:19,000
we clicked it.

4089
02:34:19,060 --> 02:34:20,520
It just says I'm too small.

4090
02:34:21,260 --> 02:34:22,540
I'm too small.

4091
02:34:22,540 --> 02:34:23,360
I'm too small.

4092
02:34:25,420 --> 02:34:27,160
How did you even get up there?

4093
02:34:27,580 --> 02:34:28,440
Wait, what's this?

4094
02:34:28,640 --> 02:34:30,520
There's a fucking croissant!

4095
02:34:30,760 --> 02:34:31,520
I'm gonna be a croissant.

4096
02:34:31,600 --> 02:34:32,320
What is this guy?

4097
02:34:32,400 --> 02:34:33,600
He's literally like an ant.

4098
02:34:33,880 --> 02:34:36,460
I'm croissant man now.

4099
02:34:37,180 --> 02:34:39,400
There's like a tiny pea somewhere too.

4100
02:34:39,780 --> 02:34:41,160
I think that is the game.

4101
02:34:41,300 --> 02:34:42,300
You just fucking...

4102
02:34:42,300 --> 02:34:45,360
You're just finding all the items.

4103
02:34:46,680 --> 02:34:47,160
You're just finding all the items.

4104
02:34:47,160 --> 02:34:47,860
What croissant?

4105
02:34:50,160 --> 02:34:52,300
This guy's like a singular blueberry.

4106
02:34:52,360 --> 02:34:52,520
This guy's like a singular blueberry.

4107
02:34:52,540 --> 02:34:54,220
And he's so fucking tiny.

4108
02:34:54,860 --> 02:34:56,480
Oh my god, yeah, Crumpet.

4109
02:34:56,520 --> 02:34:57,420
Is it the Crumpet guy?

4110
02:34:58,080 --> 02:34:59,760
Yeah, he's so fucking tiny.

4111
02:34:59,760 --> 02:35:01,040
It was just a name.

4112
02:35:01,600 --> 02:35:04,260
Oh my god, there's a giant melon up here.

4113
02:35:05,180 --> 02:35:07,300
Oh wait, I'm like weighing this down.

4114
02:35:07,380 --> 02:35:08,720
It's like an elevator system.

4115
02:35:10,060 --> 02:35:12,180
This is worse Waldo, but food.

4116
02:35:12,980 --> 02:35:13,540
Guys.

4117
02:35:13,900 --> 02:35:15,580
Guys, I need... There's a tomato?

4118
02:35:16,800 --> 02:35:20,580
Oh my god, there's several tomatoes, but I wanna be the giant melon.

4119
02:35:21,680 --> 02:35:22,520
Oh my god, there's several tomatoes, but I wanna be the giant melon.

4120
02:35:23,880 --> 02:35:25,840
Guys, I need a giant melon.

4121
02:35:27,660 --> 02:35:28,860
I'm addicted to this.

4122
02:35:29,500 --> 02:35:30,040
I'm addicted to this.

4123
02:35:30,100 --> 02:35:31,080
I'm enchanting.

4124
02:35:32,280 --> 02:35:33,120
I can do this.

4125
02:35:33,120 --> 02:35:33,740
I'm helping this book.

4126
02:35:35,000 --> 02:35:37,760
I... No, I'm trying to that me and my...

4127
02:35:37,760 --> 02:35:42,300
me and this tomato gang are trying to walk up the fucking vacuum.

4128
02:35:43,260 --> 02:35:43,700
Guys!

4129
02:35:44,020 --> 02:35:50,220
I tried to lift him up on this elevator and I thought he was gonna climb to new heights, but all he did was just like jump off.

4130
02:35:50,740 --> 02:35:53,100
Oh my god, how did this tomato do it?

4131
02:35:54,660 --> 02:35:55,860
Let me climb.

4132
02:35:57,520 --> 02:35:57,920
Alright.

4133
02:35:58,860 --> 02:35:59,520
Wait, no!

4134
02:36:00,580 --> 02:36:02,020
I'm too fucking long!

4135
02:36:03,180 --> 02:36:05,080
I can't do this as a croissant!

4136
02:36:05,820 --> 02:36:06,940
I'm gonna do it as an orange.

4137
02:36:10,380 --> 02:36:12,520
Guys, I need to be the giant watermelon.

4138
02:36:13,280 --> 02:36:13,680
Guys, I need to be the giant watermelon.

4139
02:36:13,680 --> 02:36:14,960
We're all trying to fucking...

4140
02:36:15,760 --> 02:36:18,220
food, like, and they're just sitting on each other.

4141
02:36:18,420 --> 02:36:20,260
And I'm like, is this the equivalent of roleplay?

4142
02:36:20,260 --> 02:36:22,140
Like, food roleplay?

4143
02:36:22,260 --> 02:36:24,080
Is this food roleplay?

4144
02:36:25,880 --> 02:36:28,040
Carol, your dough is so fuzziness!

4145
02:36:28,400 --> 02:36:29,120
Oh, I hear ya.

4146
02:36:29,260 --> 02:36:31,380
How did that other tomato do it?

4147
02:36:31,460 --> 02:36:32,520
Oh, there's a banana!

4148
02:36:32,860 --> 02:36:34,160
I see a banana up here.

4149
02:36:34,520 --> 02:36:36,920
I'm playing getting over it, but as fruits.

4150
02:36:37,860 --> 02:36:39,420
This is a hockey arena!

4151
02:36:40,100 --> 02:36:41,440
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

4152
02:36:42,040 --> 02:36:44,240
Guys, how... I can't stop spinning.

4153
02:36:44,240 --> 02:36:45,660
Guys, how do we get up here, guys?

4154
02:36:46,400 --> 02:36:46,880
Guys.

4155
02:36:47,780 --> 02:36:48,260
Nooooo!

4156
02:36:48,700 --> 02:36:49,020
No!

4157
02:36:49,360 --> 02:36:49,760
Oh!

4158
02:36:49,780 --> 02:36:51,020
I knocked somebody off.

4159
02:36:52,020 --> 02:36:53,380
Get out, get out, get out.

4160
02:36:53,740 --> 02:36:55,860
I need to get up there and be a melon.

4161
02:36:58,100 --> 02:36:58,800
Come on.

4162
02:37:00,360 --> 02:37:01,220
This is it.

4163
02:37:01,320 --> 02:37:03,600
It looks so much better to be a circular fruit.

4164
02:37:03,900 --> 02:37:04,260
AHHHH!

4165
02:37:04,580 --> 02:37:05,460
I give up.

4166
02:37:05,700 --> 02:37:06,480
I can't...

4167
02:37:06,480 --> 02:37:08,120
I can't turn into a melon.

4168
02:37:08,920 --> 02:37:10,320
I've given up, Snuffy.

4169
02:37:10,580 --> 02:37:12,020
How do you find the melons?

4170
02:37:12,040 --> 02:37:13,800
It's like, literally up there.

4171
02:37:14,740 --> 02:37:15,760
It's up top there.

4172
02:37:15,760 --> 02:37:16,460
Oh my god!

4173
02:37:16,880 --> 02:37:18,080
All the way up here?

4174
02:37:18,340 --> 02:37:19,920
It's all the way up there.

4175
02:37:20,040 --> 02:37:21,960
Oh, you gotta get up through the Dyson vacuum.

4176
02:37:22,640 --> 02:37:24,200
I couldn't get up there.

4177
02:37:24,320 --> 02:37:25,420
I did, but then...

4178
02:37:25,420 --> 02:37:25,960
I got this.

4179
02:37:25,960 --> 02:37:29,060
We have to build a fucking ladder together to get up there.

4180
02:37:29,600 --> 02:37:30,920
I'm a piece of pizza.

4181
02:37:31,040 --> 02:37:33,280
I'm gonna be a vital... I'll be a vital...

4182
02:37:33,280 --> 02:37:34,520
We need a ramp.

4183
02:37:34,820 --> 02:37:36,980
We need a make a ramp, dragons!

4184
02:37:38,700 --> 02:37:39,700
Make a ramp!

4185
02:37:41,140 --> 02:37:42,960
Why the fuck did you jump?

4186
02:37:43,160 --> 02:37:43,460
Why?

4187
02:37:44,340 --> 02:37:45,280
Did you die?

4188
02:37:46,880 --> 02:37:48,220
I got shot and died!

4189
02:37:50,300 --> 02:37:52,140
Build a ladder!

4190
02:37:53,980 --> 02:37:54,660
Build a ladder!

4191
02:37:54,660 --> 02:37:55,440
I need that melon!

4192
02:37:56,000 --> 02:37:56,040
Excuse me.

4193
02:37:57,420 --> 02:37:59,500
Build a ladder, so...

4194
02:37:59,500 --> 02:38:00,980
That's the end game!

4195
02:38:01,160 --> 02:38:02,420
To be a melon!

4196
02:38:04,960 --> 02:38:06,340
We need something...

4197
02:38:06,340 --> 02:38:06,740
I was congested!

4198
02:38:06,840 --> 02:38:08,380
Somebody lie down!

4199
02:38:08,580 --> 02:38:09,260
Oh shit!

4200
02:38:11,280 --> 02:38:12,400
It's just a...

4201
02:38:12,400 --> 02:38:13,480
It's just a...

4202
02:38:13,480 --> 02:38:14,120
There's an egg.

4203
02:38:14,680 --> 02:38:15,940
We're all trying to fucking...

4204
02:38:15,940 --> 02:38:16,720
Do you see the tomato?

4205
02:38:17,560 --> 02:38:20,640
We're all trying to fucking climb with single file, guys!

4206
02:38:21,120 --> 02:38:22,120
Single file!

4207
02:38:25,800 --> 02:38:28,260
What a fucking long ass line!

4208
02:38:29,800 --> 02:38:32,780
Are we in the fucking UK in the queue right now?

4209
02:38:33,640 --> 02:38:34,560
We're at Disneyland.

4210
02:38:35,400 --> 02:38:36,860
There's no fast pass here.

4211
02:38:37,100 --> 02:38:38,500
We gotta get a fast pass.

4212
02:38:38,560 --> 02:38:39,460
I gotta get my app out.

4213
02:38:39,720 --> 02:38:42,500
I feel like we're in...

4214
02:38:42,500 --> 02:38:43,580
There's no fast pass.

4215
02:38:43,640 --> 02:38:43,920
Look at it.

4216
02:38:44,120 --> 02:38:46,560
Oh my god, there's a traffic jam.

4217
02:38:46,820 --> 02:38:47,780
Of all these fruits.

4218
02:38:49,000 --> 02:38:49,560
Guys!

4219
02:38:49,940 --> 02:38:50,660
Get up!

4220
02:38:51,740 --> 02:38:53,220
I need my melon!

4221
02:38:54,440 --> 02:38:56,380
The fucking tomato is too...

4222
02:38:56,380 --> 02:38:56,660
Get up!

4223
02:38:56,700 --> 02:38:57,760
I don't understand.

4224
02:38:58,260 --> 02:38:59,340
I can't fit.

4225
02:38:59,620 --> 02:39:00,300
Alright, here you go.

4226
02:39:01,100 --> 02:39:02,220
A cookie!

4227
02:39:02,460 --> 02:39:03,300
Oh my god, a cookie?

4228
02:39:03,600 --> 02:39:05,380
Guys, I don't think the tomatoes...

4229
02:39:05,380 --> 02:39:09,640
We need something flat and then you lie down and then you stack up amongst each other.

4230
02:39:09,980 --> 02:39:11,060
Become a pizza.

4231
02:39:11,420 --> 02:39:12,860
Yeah, yeah, all pizzas!

4232
02:39:14,120 --> 02:39:14,320
All pizzas and breads!

4233
02:39:14,800 --> 02:39:16,400
All pizzas and breads!

4234
02:39:17,760 --> 02:39:19,860
Yeah, yeah, all pizza and bread!

4235
02:39:20,060 --> 02:39:20,900
Change now!

4236
02:39:21,820 --> 02:39:23,260
Oh, I found a mango.

4237
02:39:23,840 --> 02:39:26,340
I got knocked into a fucking mango.

4238
02:39:29,060 --> 02:39:30,120
Oh my god, look!

4239
02:39:30,180 --> 02:39:30,640
Look at them!

4240
02:39:30,840 --> 02:39:31,900
They stacked up!

4241
02:39:32,740 --> 02:39:34,680
We've actually coordinated it.

4242
02:39:34,740 --> 02:39:37,000
Yeah, but I think one guy killed the other.

4243
02:39:37,220 --> 02:39:38,740
This guy is like a calzone.

4244
02:39:38,800 --> 02:39:39,780
He's a whole pie.

4245
02:39:40,280 --> 02:39:41,740
Oh my god, this is it!

4246
02:39:42,260 --> 02:39:42,780
Oh!

4247
02:39:44,340 --> 02:39:44,860
What?

4248
02:39:45,000 --> 02:39:45,320
Wait!

4249
02:39:45,440 --> 02:39:46,400
Wait, this is it!

4250
02:39:46,520 --> 02:39:48,900
Guys, collide into each other and then push me up!

4251
02:39:49,060 --> 02:39:52,740
Guys, we collide into each other and then we ragdoll into it.

4252
02:39:53,080 --> 02:39:54,820
Pump, pump, collide right now!

4253
02:39:55,360 --> 02:39:56,380
This is the strat!

4254
02:40:00,500 --> 02:40:03,380
Force myself to ragdoll up there!

4255
02:40:09,200 --> 02:40:11,720
Force myself to ragdoll up there!

4256
02:40:12,860 --> 02:40:16,540
Look at the people trying to make a ladder up top, Snuffy.

4257
02:40:16,600 --> 02:40:17,200
Do you see that?

4258
02:40:17,460 --> 02:40:19,100
It's actually so useful though.

4259
02:40:19,240 --> 02:40:20,860
Their brain is huge.

4260
02:40:20,940 --> 02:40:21,400
Here I come.

4261
02:40:21,440 --> 02:40:22,600
I'm gonna go test it out for myself.

4262
02:40:24,260 --> 02:40:25,520
Just taking a nice walk.

4263
02:40:25,600 --> 02:40:26,720
You can't get collided up there.

4264
02:40:26,720 --> 02:40:28,100
Oh my god, they've made like a whole...

4265
02:40:28,100 --> 02:40:29,420
Okay, don't walk up there.

4266
02:40:29,440 --> 02:40:29,840
Don't jump.

4267
02:40:29,860 --> 02:40:30,480
Don't jump at all.

4268
02:40:32,300 --> 02:40:32,700
Okay.

4269
02:40:32,700 --> 02:40:33,100
Nevermind.

4270
02:40:33,160 --> 02:40:34,740
Ignore my strat of the colliding.

4271
02:40:34,780 --> 02:40:35,720
It doesn't work anymore.

4272
02:40:36,480 --> 02:40:36,880
No!

4273
02:40:38,980 --> 02:40:41,700
We just need one person to be the member!

4274
02:40:41,720 --> 02:40:42,260
And then...

4275
02:40:42,820 --> 02:40:48,300
This is like that one meme from the Jimmy Neutron where it's like, the pizza is aggressive.

4276
02:40:49,880 --> 02:40:51,360
Just flying everywhere.

4277
02:40:51,620 --> 02:40:52,880
Oh my god, I just saw a pizza fall.

4278
02:40:52,980 --> 02:40:55,760
Oh my god, did you see that fucking apple stacking up against each other?

4279
02:40:56,020 --> 02:40:56,460
Hello?

4280
02:40:56,700 --> 02:40:57,920
I'm sorry, I didn't...

4281
02:40:57,920 --> 02:41:00,360
Look at the stack.

4282
02:41:01,420 --> 02:41:02,560
Look at this.

4283
02:41:03,680 --> 02:41:04,660
I can't move.

4284
02:41:04,920 --> 02:41:05,660
Are you stuck?

4285
02:41:05,680 --> 02:41:05,920
I can't move.

4286
02:41:05,980 --> 02:41:06,600
Wait, you're stuck.

4287
02:41:07,980 --> 02:41:09,020
Please help.

4288
02:41:09,220 --> 02:41:09,980
Mr. Tomato.

4289
02:41:11,720 --> 02:41:12,300
Swap characters.

4290
02:41:13,540 --> 02:41:14,020
No.

4291
02:41:15,140 --> 02:41:16,000
No, please.

4292
02:41:16,940 --> 02:41:17,860
Guys, please.

4293
02:41:17,960 --> 02:41:20,180
Let me fucking be a melon!

4294
02:41:21,640 --> 02:41:22,120
Please!

4295
02:41:23,420 --> 02:41:24,420
I'm going back up.

4296
02:41:24,480 --> 02:41:25,220
I'm back down.

4297
02:41:26,620 --> 02:41:28,040
Okay, I got stuck, but I'm good.

4298
02:41:28,100 --> 02:41:28,540
I'm coming back.

4299
02:41:29,500 --> 02:41:29,980
Alright.

4300
02:41:30,840 --> 02:41:31,860
We're single file.

4301
02:41:31,980 --> 02:41:32,760
Guys, stop!

4302
02:41:33,100 --> 02:41:34,440
Guys, let me get up!

4303
02:41:36,280 --> 02:41:37,840
What do they call these things?

4304
02:41:37,920 --> 02:41:39,360
Like immovable force?

4305
02:41:39,840 --> 02:41:40,320
Stop!

4306
02:41:41,720 --> 02:41:43,540
Bro, we can't progress!

4307
02:41:44,020 --> 02:41:45,080
I wanna join!

4308
02:41:45,260 --> 02:41:46,880
I wanna join them!

4309
02:41:46,960 --> 02:41:48,060
Look at them!

4310
02:41:48,120 --> 02:41:49,960
Wait, some of them fucking fell.

4311
02:41:50,120 --> 02:41:50,780
What happened?

4312
02:41:51,620 --> 02:41:52,160
Oh!

4313
02:41:53,440 --> 02:41:54,960
Oh, wrong direction!

4314
02:41:55,000 --> 02:41:56,260
Where did I go?

4315
02:41:57,320 --> 02:41:58,540
What the fuck?

4316
02:41:59,000 --> 02:42:00,780
Where the fuck did I go?

4317
02:42:01,260 --> 02:42:02,880
You need to be bigger and better.

4318
02:42:03,560 --> 02:42:05,560
Assert my dominance over the ladder.

4319
02:42:05,880 --> 02:42:06,700
I hear you.

4320
02:42:06,960 --> 02:42:08,140
I'm just getting pushed around like a nobody.

4321
02:42:08,140 --> 02:42:09,200
I got like pushed out of bounds.

4322
02:42:09,200 --> 02:42:10,000
Oh my god, there's a tree.

4323
02:42:12,720 --> 02:42:13,400
I'm here.

4324
02:42:13,880 --> 02:42:14,600
I'm here.

4325
02:42:14,840 --> 02:42:16,760
Maybe this is... it'll launch me.

4326
02:42:17,020 --> 02:42:18,860
Guys, I think I'm gonna give up, guys.

4327
02:42:19,180 --> 02:42:23,420
I don't think we're getting to the melon.

4328
02:42:24,040 --> 02:42:24,920
I don't think we're getting to the melon.

4329
02:42:25,560 --> 02:42:27,860
I don't think we're getting to the melon.

4330
02:42:30,420 --> 02:42:31,340
Let me through.

4331
02:42:31,500 --> 02:42:32,740
Let me through, I'm important.

4332
02:42:33,080 --> 02:42:34,000
I'm an orange.

4333
02:42:34,740 --> 02:42:37,040
Oh my god, there's an onigiri on the table.

4334
02:42:37,160 --> 02:42:37,580
How cute!

4335
02:42:38,700 --> 02:42:39,100
Guys...

4336
02:42:39,100 --> 02:42:40,400
I haven't seen anybody with that one.

4337
02:42:40,600 --> 02:42:42,200
I haven't been up here in so long.

4338
02:42:43,140 --> 02:42:45,220
I'm a tissue next to the onigiri.

4339
02:42:46,740 --> 02:42:47,900
Oh my god, we made it.

4340
02:42:48,200 --> 02:42:49,220
We made it, Yozo!

4341
02:42:49,600 --> 02:42:50,440
You and I!

4342
02:42:51,780 --> 02:42:52,700
We did it!

4343
02:42:53,820 --> 02:42:55,060
Did you get up there?

4344
02:42:55,080 --> 02:42:55,520
You're a melon?

4345
02:42:55,920 --> 02:42:56,880
No, not really.

4346
02:42:57,520 --> 02:42:59,400
We're trying to figure out how to get up top.

4347
02:42:59,660 --> 02:43:00,880
I'm gonna try and push.

4348
02:43:01,100 --> 02:43:01,880
Oh my god!

4349
02:43:02,020 --> 02:43:03,080
Oh my god, the lemon!

4350
02:43:06,240 --> 02:43:09,400
Oh, he kicked out the other apple!

4351
02:43:10,080 --> 02:43:15,420
The other apple got kicked out.

4352
02:43:16,480 --> 02:43:17,300
I'm ragged.

4353
02:43:17,320 --> 02:43:18,360
Okay, I shouldn't have ragged off.

4354
02:43:18,520 --> 02:43:19,980
Wait, someone got to the melon!

4355
02:43:20,500 --> 02:43:22,240
Oh my god, they did it!

4356
02:43:22,660 --> 02:43:23,980
Oh my god, they did it!

4357
02:43:24,180 --> 02:43:25,400
They did it, they're a melon!

4358
02:43:31,730 --> 02:43:32,530
Click it!

4359
02:43:34,910 --> 02:43:37,390
He's literally standing there, just haunting you.

4360
02:43:37,410 --> 02:43:38,210
Click the melon!

4361
02:43:38,770 --> 02:43:40,750
I wanna see what it looks like!

4362
02:43:41,110 --> 02:43:42,450
Click the melon!

4363
02:43:42,910 --> 02:43:43,470
Did he click it?

4364
02:43:43,530 --> 02:43:44,930
I got fucking squashed.

4365
02:43:46,150 --> 02:43:47,810
That's not a melon, that's a pumpkin.

4366
02:43:48,090 --> 02:43:49,410
Where the fuck is the melon?

4367
02:43:50,570 --> 02:43:52,590
Did he not even click it?

4368
02:43:53,490 --> 02:43:54,530
Did he not even click it?

4369
02:43:54,530 --> 02:43:56,130
Where the fuck is the melon?

4370
02:43:56,490 --> 02:44:00,430
He wants you to have the satisfaction yourself of being the first melon on the map.

4371
02:44:00,650 --> 02:44:00,690
No!

4372
02:44:00,690 --> 02:44:01,610
Get me out of this game!

4373
02:44:01,650 --> 02:44:02,870
Just click the melon!

4374
02:44:05,270 --> 02:44:07,250
Just click the melon!

4375
02:44:10,350 --> 02:44:11,890
Just click it!

4376
02:44:12,010 --> 02:44:12,890
I just wanna know what it is.

4377
02:44:12,890 --> 02:44:14,070
I just wanna know what it looks like!

4378
02:44:14,450 --> 02:44:15,590
I'm so distressed!

4379
02:44:15,870 --> 02:44:16,190
He clicked!

4380
02:44:16,190 --> 02:44:16,850
Look at him!

4381
02:44:17,010 --> 02:44:17,950
He's so big!

4382
02:44:18,510 --> 02:44:19,190
He did it!

4383
02:44:19,210 --> 02:44:19,870
Look at him!

4384
02:44:21,710 --> 02:44:22,910
It was worth it.

4385
02:44:22,970 --> 02:44:24,450
Look at this giant melon.

4386
02:44:25,190 --> 02:44:30,230
Worth is giving me like a sense of disassociation as I get shoved to the floor.

4387
02:44:30,230 --> 02:44:33,130
And I'm just like, who am I?

4388
02:44:34,790 --> 02:44:36,050
Let's like, kick the melon.

4389
02:44:36,570 --> 02:44:37,650
Kill the melon.

4390
02:44:40,950 --> 02:44:42,250
We're all just like...

4391
02:44:42,250 --> 02:44:43,230
He's a pumpkin!

4392
02:44:43,650 --> 02:44:44,870
Huge melons!

4393
02:44:44,950 --> 02:44:45,530
Oh my god!

4394
02:44:45,530 --> 02:44:47,110
We killed the melon!

4395
02:44:47,410 --> 02:44:49,150
We actually killed the melon!

4396
02:44:49,770 --> 02:44:50,930
Good job guys!

4397
02:44:51,150 --> 02:44:51,790
Good job!

4398
02:44:52,450 --> 02:44:53,370
We did it!

4399
02:44:53,450 --> 02:44:54,750
Let's find another game, Snuffy.

4400
02:44:55,430 --> 02:44:59,390
Alright, Snuffy, find me your best game ever.

4401
02:44:59,650 --> 02:45:00,590
This is LG.

4402
02:45:00,590 --> 02:45:01,670
The best game ever?

4403
02:45:01,970 --> 02:45:02,850
Oh my goodness.

4404
02:45:02,870 --> 02:45:05,430
The best server.

4405
02:45:05,970 --> 02:45:07,170
Okay, okay, okay.

4406
02:45:09,470 --> 02:45:10,430
No pressure.

4407
02:45:10,590 --> 02:45:11,050
No pressure.

4408
02:45:11,470 --> 02:45:12,570
That's a lot of pressure.

4409
02:45:12,610 --> 02:45:14,010
No pressure or anything.

4410
02:45:14,230 --> 02:45:15,870
No pressure or anything, Snuffy.

4411
02:45:17,190 --> 02:45:18,230
Oh goodness.

4412
02:45:18,630 --> 02:45:19,630
Oh goodness, goodness.

4413
02:45:19,990 --> 02:45:20,790
Okay, okay.

4414
02:45:22,670 --> 02:45:24,370
Okay, okay, hold on.

4415
02:45:24,410 --> 02:45:25,790
I need to cook for a second.

4416
02:45:26,070 --> 02:45:27,050
You need to cook?

4417
02:45:28,530 --> 02:45:29,050
Wait.

4418
02:45:30,270 --> 02:45:32,050
Did I start the game for real?

4419
02:45:33,630 --> 02:45:35,010
Did I start the game?

4420
02:45:35,250 --> 02:45:36,370
Oh my god!

4421
02:45:37,650 --> 02:45:38,270
Wait, what?

4422
02:45:38,470 --> 02:45:39,490
Found hiders?

4423
02:45:39,630 --> 02:45:41,050
Oh, I finished the game.

4424
02:45:42,070 --> 02:45:43,030
Wait, what?

4425
02:45:43,470 --> 02:45:45,650
There was really a game the whole time?

4426
02:45:45,730 --> 02:45:47,910
It was trying to find the food.

4427
02:45:48,030 --> 02:45:48,610
That's it.

4428
02:45:48,870 --> 02:45:50,970
I literally restarted the server.

4429
02:45:51,810 --> 02:45:53,830
You were like the server owner?

4430
02:45:54,050 --> 02:45:54,390
What?

4431
02:45:55,190 --> 02:45:57,950
I'm in a different server now, I think.

4432
02:45:58,570 --> 02:46:00,810
I think I'm in a different server.

4433
02:46:01,050 --> 02:46:01,250
I think I'm in a different server.

4434
02:46:01,250 --> 02:46:01,370
Yeah.

4435
02:46:04,270 --> 02:46:05,610
This was the game.

4436
02:46:05,610 --> 02:46:08,350
You gotta find all the food.

4437
02:46:09,050 --> 02:46:09,850
You gotta find all the food.

4438
02:46:10,270 --> 02:46:11,530
That was it.

4439
02:46:12,530 --> 02:46:13,130
Whee!

4440
02:46:13,310 --> 02:46:15,690
I found the melon and I won the game.

4441
02:46:19,250 --> 02:46:19,850
Dang.

4442
02:46:20,070 --> 02:46:22,670
I thought that was just all about teamwork.

4443
02:46:23,310 --> 02:46:28,530
It was literally finding all the food and then that's it.

4444
02:46:28,770 --> 02:46:30,010
And then you could end the game.

4445
02:46:30,390 --> 02:46:33,030
I found four and then the game was good enough.

4446
02:46:34,010 --> 02:46:36,790
I found four and then the game was good enough.

4447
02:46:37,410 --> 02:46:40,330
I found one that's like Roblox Omegle.

4448
02:46:40,910 --> 02:46:42,310
Is that what it was called?

4449
02:46:43,370 --> 02:46:43,870
Omegle?

4450
02:46:44,210 --> 02:46:45,250
Oh, I found...

4451
02:46:46,010 --> 02:46:47,170
Is this a tomato?

4452
02:46:47,490 --> 02:46:48,590
Oh my god.

4453
02:46:50,850 --> 02:46:51,830
Or is it?

4454
02:46:53,770 --> 02:46:54,810
I'm me now.

4455
02:46:56,670 --> 02:47:00,190
Okay, we should not play Roblox Omega just for the sake of our safety.

4456
02:47:00,330 --> 02:47:01,390
We should not play it.

4457
02:47:01,390 --> 02:47:03,470
Yeah, it's got like a heart in the game.

4458
02:47:03,590 --> 02:47:04,070
That's dangerous.

4459
02:47:06,790 --> 02:47:07,850
Roblox Omega.

4460
02:47:09,750 --> 02:47:12,890
I don't think I feel safe playing Roblox Omega.

4461
02:47:13,030 --> 02:47:13,610
Just saying.

4462
02:47:16,350 --> 02:47:19,610
My only favorite is Nicki Minaj's Gag City.

4463
02:47:19,830 --> 02:47:20,850
That's not a very good one.

4464
02:47:20,850 --> 02:47:21,230
What?

4465
02:47:21,230 --> 02:47:22,530
What even is that?

4466
02:47:22,950 --> 02:47:25,010
It's Nicki Minaj's Gag City.

4467
02:47:25,150 --> 02:47:26,130
That doesn't...

4468
02:47:30,550 --> 02:47:31,950
Oh my god.

4469
02:47:32,930 --> 02:47:33,970
Okay, okay, okay.

4470
02:47:34,210 --> 02:47:36,530
The ultimate... This is a tough one.

4471
02:47:36,790 --> 02:47:38,210
There's a lot of different options here.

4472
02:47:39,570 --> 02:47:43,770
What does Chat think is their most favorite Roblox game?

4473
02:47:44,510 --> 02:47:44,690
What does Chat think is their most favorite Roblox game?

4474
02:47:44,690 --> 02:47:45,090
Yeah, yeah, Chat.

4475
02:47:45,230 --> 02:47:46,510
What is like the ultimate game?

4476
02:47:46,730 --> 02:47:47,970
I've got a lot of niche games.

4477
02:47:48,270 --> 02:47:51,390
They're all good, but I would never say any of those are the best.

4478
02:47:51,530 --> 02:47:52,430
The best Roblox games.

4479
02:47:52,430 --> 02:47:53,750
Someone says Starscape.

4480
02:47:53,850 --> 02:47:54,550
What's Starscape?

4481
02:47:54,930 --> 02:47:56,610
I have not heard of that one.

4482
02:47:56,730 --> 02:47:57,950
So clearly that's a lie.

4483
02:47:59,450 --> 02:48:01,110
There's a lot of Starscape.

4484
02:48:01,870 --> 02:48:02,310
There's a lot of Starscape.

4485
02:48:03,050 --> 02:48:03,490
Starscape?

4486
02:48:04,230 --> 02:48:04,870
Yeah.

4487
02:48:05,030 --> 02:48:07,250
Star and Escape.

4488
02:48:11,920 --> 02:48:13,160
Never heard of this.

4489
02:48:13,400 --> 02:48:14,340
The Mimic?

4490
02:48:14,360 --> 02:48:15,380
Isn't that the...

4491
02:48:16,120 --> 02:48:18,420
Isn't that like...

4492
02:48:18,420 --> 02:48:19,700
Wait, isn't that...

4493
02:48:19,700 --> 02:48:21,160
That's famous, right?

4494
02:48:21,220 --> 02:48:22,620
Isn't that famous Roblox game?

4495
02:48:22,820 --> 02:48:23,440
The Mimic?

4496
02:48:25,160 --> 02:48:26,920
I don't know.

4497
02:48:27,680 --> 02:48:28,740
Sounds familiar.

4498
02:48:29,460 --> 02:48:31,040
It does sound familiar.

4499
02:48:32,920 --> 02:48:34,760
Good girl sorority.

4500
02:48:36,120 --> 02:48:36,760
People say...

4501
02:48:36,780 --> 02:48:37,380
What is the Mimic?

4502
02:48:37,380 --> 02:48:38,180
Wild Horse Island.

4503
02:48:39,580 --> 02:48:41,040
Wait, someone says Mimic.

4504
02:48:41,060 --> 02:48:41,900
Try the Mimic.

4505
02:48:42,040 --> 02:48:42,480
Alright.

4506
02:48:43,000 --> 02:48:43,860
Should we do it?

4507
02:48:45,260 --> 02:48:46,220
I can...

4508
02:48:46,220 --> 02:48:47,960
Let's see it.

4509
02:48:48,180 --> 02:48:49,720
Let me take a look.

4510
02:48:49,880 --> 02:48:51,440
It is highly rated.

4511
02:48:51,500 --> 02:48:52,340
It seems very popular.

4512
02:48:52,740 --> 02:48:53,640
Alright, let's try it.

4513
02:48:53,660 --> 02:48:54,480
I think it's a horror game.

4514
02:48:54,900 --> 02:48:57,400
How scary can Roblox be?

4515
02:48:58,820 --> 02:49:01,000
Of course, this is a pretty spooky game.

4516
02:49:01,120 --> 02:49:04,000
How scary can Roblox horror be?

4517
02:49:04,540 --> 02:49:05,020
Snuffy.

4518
02:49:05,400 --> 02:49:06,140
Come on.

4519
02:49:07,340 --> 02:49:08,580
Come on.

4520
02:49:09,680 --> 02:49:10,320
Okay.

4521
02:49:10,780 --> 02:49:11,420
Right.

4522
02:49:11,960 --> 02:49:13,480
This looks pretty high def.

4523
02:49:14,080 --> 02:49:14,720
No.

4524
02:49:15,780 --> 02:49:16,420
Whoa.

4525
02:49:16,820 --> 02:49:17,460
No.

4526
02:49:20,560 --> 02:49:20,880
No.

4527
02:49:21,000 --> 02:49:22,820
How scary can this be?

4528
02:49:25,580 --> 02:49:26,220
Whoa.

4529
02:49:26,680 --> 02:49:28,040
Am I in the...

4530
02:49:28,780 --> 02:49:29,760
Where are you?

4531
02:49:30,920 --> 02:49:32,720
I'm in the lobby.

4532
02:49:32,760 --> 02:49:33,740
I think I see you.

4533
02:49:34,320 --> 02:49:35,080
See me?

4534
02:49:36,780 --> 02:49:37,060
I'm just going to take my skin away.

4535
02:49:37,400 --> 02:49:38,360
You did too.

4536
02:49:39,300 --> 02:49:41,660
You look like a regular woman now.

4537
02:49:45,980 --> 02:49:46,500
Guys!

4538
02:49:46,760 --> 02:49:47,800
Guys look at Snuffy.

4539
02:49:52,930 --> 02:49:54,910
Look at how you don't even have a shirt.

4540
02:49:55,050 --> 02:49:55,250
Look at how you don't even have a shirt.

4541
02:49:55,250 --> 02:49:55,970
You're fucking naked.

4542
02:49:56,290 --> 02:49:56,930
What the fuck?

4543
02:49:57,230 --> 02:49:58,470
You have pants on.

4544
02:49:59,630 --> 02:50:02,030
I can't even tell.

4545
02:50:04,490 --> 02:50:06,510
You got like a Garfield.

4546
02:50:06,510 --> 02:50:06,710
Garfield!

4547
02:50:06,750 --> 02:50:07,910
I was gonna say Darfield!

4548
02:50:08,110 --> 02:50:08,790
Doki Garfield!

4549
02:50:08,930 --> 02:50:11,590
Oh yeah, my Garfield face!

4550
02:50:11,970 --> 02:50:12,930
There's saves!

4551
02:50:13,110 --> 02:50:14,950
So over here there's invite friends?

4552
02:50:16,210 --> 02:50:18,310
Isn't it this one?

4553
02:50:18,430 --> 02:50:20,150
Oh that's like invite real friends.

4554
02:50:21,050 --> 02:50:22,050
Gamer lobbies!

4555
02:50:23,450 --> 02:50:24,210
Oh yeah?

4556
02:50:26,870 --> 02:50:28,990
Might put us into another different instance.

4557
02:50:29,730 --> 02:50:31,010
No, wait, what?

4558
02:50:31,650 --> 02:50:33,110
Okay, I can invite you.

4559
02:50:33,290 --> 02:50:34,870
Let me hide the game.

4560
02:50:34,870 --> 02:50:35,610
Yeah, me too.

4561
02:50:35,690 --> 02:50:36,450
Let me hide the game.

4562
02:50:38,610 --> 02:50:40,350
I don't know what happened, but I did...

4563
02:50:40,350 --> 02:50:41,410
Oh, it says I joined you.

4564
02:50:41,690 --> 02:50:42,670
Did you get my invite?

4565
02:50:44,030 --> 02:50:44,630
Did I?

4566
02:50:46,410 --> 02:50:49,710
Look at your actual Roblox notifications or something.

4567
02:50:49,730 --> 02:50:50,930
Wait, I have a Roblox notification?

4568
02:50:54,430 --> 02:50:55,390
On the website.

4569
02:50:55,490 --> 02:50:56,170
On the website maybe?

4570
02:50:57,090 --> 02:50:58,310
Oh, I see it!

4571
02:50:58,930 --> 02:51:00,190
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4572
02:51:01,350 --> 02:51:02,070
Yeah, join.

4573
02:51:02,850 --> 02:51:03,250
Open.

4574
02:51:04,870 --> 02:51:06,330
I can't notification.

4575
02:51:07,030 --> 02:51:08,650
What are you talking about?

4576
02:51:08,950 --> 02:51:09,430
Okay.

4577
02:51:10,130 --> 02:51:10,610
Play.

4578
02:51:12,050 --> 02:51:12,710
Am I in?

4579
02:51:14,030 --> 02:51:14,730
I don't know.

4580
02:51:15,090 --> 02:51:15,630
I think I'm back in the lobby.

4581
02:51:16,570 --> 02:51:17,670
Oh, me too, me too.

4582
02:51:17,930 --> 02:51:19,270
Wait, how the fuck do we start?

4583
02:51:20,250 --> 02:51:22,130
Guys, how do we start this game?

4584
02:51:22,470 --> 02:51:23,730
How do we start?

4585
02:51:23,730 --> 02:51:24,790
We're back in the lobby!

4586
02:51:26,850 --> 02:51:27,490
Let's see.

4587
02:51:27,570 --> 02:51:28,150
Where do you start?

4588
02:51:28,430 --> 02:51:28,910
Play?

4589
02:51:29,110 --> 02:51:29,630
Just play?

4590
02:51:29,870 --> 02:51:31,490
Oh, there's lobbies if you play.

4591
02:51:32,310 --> 02:51:32,790
Oh, just play.

4592
02:51:32,790 --> 02:51:33,390
I'm so stupid.

Chelsea, wait.

4596
02:51:36,390 --> 02:51:36,690
Create lobby.

4597
02:51:36,930 --> 02:51:39,210
There's like four fucking books.

4598
02:51:39,270 --> 02:51:39,810
Is this Japan?

4599
02:51:41,070 --> 02:51:41,930
Oh my god.

4600
02:51:43,350 --> 02:51:44,310
Normal multiplayer?

4601
02:51:47,410 --> 02:51:48,590
Oh, there you go.

4602
02:51:48,590 --> 02:51:49,070

4603
02:51:49,790 --> 02:51:50,470
That's me.

4604
02:51:50,590 --> 02:51:51,950
Hey, I just started before you started.

4605
02:51:52,930 --> 02:51:54,790
There was no like private lobby.

4606
02:51:57,870 --> 02:51:58,350
Okay.

4607
02:51:58,450 --> 02:51:59,210
A butterfly.

4608
02:51:59,370 --> 02:52:00,290
A beautiful butterfly.

4609
02:52:03,510 --> 02:52:05,510
How scary can a Roblox lobby be?

4610
02:52:06,930 --> 02:52:08,490
Whoa, I joined Fart.

4611
02:52:09,430 --> 02:52:10,810
Flashing lights and jump scares.

4612
02:52:11,050 --> 02:52:11,350
Uh oh.

4613
02:52:11,430 --> 02:52:11,690
Guys, get...

4614
02:52:11,690 --> 02:52:12,550
Oh my god, it's dark.

4615
02:52:12,870 --> 02:52:13,970
There's jump scares, guys.

4616
02:52:20,320 --> 02:52:20,760
La...

4617
02:52:20,760 --> 02:52:21,380
Hello.

4618
02:52:21,460 --> 02:52:22,400
Quinta Aztecs?

4619
02:52:22,520 --> 02:52:22,840
Quinta?

4620
02:52:23,240 --> 02:52:23,680
Quinta?

4621
02:52:23,800 --> 02:52:25,040
La Quinta Aztecs?

4622
02:52:25,140 --> 02:52:25,820
Do we just go inside?

4623
02:52:26,700 --> 02:52:27,600
Are we at a school?

4624
02:52:29,040 --> 02:52:29,960
Whoa, this is first person.

4625
02:52:29,960 --> 02:52:30,200
I feel like I'm drunk.

4626
02:52:30,280 --> 02:52:31,760
I've got like a wobbly camera.

4627
02:52:31,900 --> 02:52:32,340
Whoa.

4628
02:52:32,820 --> 02:52:33,600
How do we...

4629
02:52:37,120 --> 02:52:37,980
Where are you?

4630
02:52:38,280 --> 02:52:39,500
I'm right behind you.

4631
02:52:39,960 --> 02:52:40,720
You see me?

4632
02:52:40,780 --> 02:52:41,480
Yeah, I see you.

4633
02:52:41,540 --> 02:52:42,340
But like, where do we go?

4634
02:52:42,800 --> 02:52:43,860
We are drunk.

4635
02:52:43,940 --> 02:52:44,940
What the fuck is this?

4636
02:52:45,480 --> 02:52:47,240
I'm like wobbly like...

4637
02:52:47,240 --> 02:52:49,580
That was a crazy fucking party, man.

4638
02:52:49,580 --> 02:52:51,220
Oh my god, that was fucking crazy.

4639
02:52:51,220 --> 02:52:52,160
Let's go back to school.

4640
02:52:52,800 --> 02:52:53,720
Let's go back to...

4641
02:52:53,720 --> 02:52:55,860
Let's go on school property.

4642
02:52:56,180 --> 02:52:57,760
Oh my god, we're gonna break in.

4643
02:52:57,820 --> 02:52:59,040
Let's break in a school.

4644
02:52:59,440 --> 02:53:02,320
Mr. Henderson's never gonna expect this.

4645
02:53:03,940 --> 02:53:05,900
He took his beer out of his car.

4646
02:53:06,080 --> 02:53:06,880
Oh my god.

4647
02:53:07,020 --> 02:53:08,580
Bro, bro, we gotta go.

4648
02:53:08,620 --> 02:53:09,480
Mr. Henderson's never gonna expect this.

4649
02:53:09,500 --> 02:53:09,920
He's gonna go to his class.

4650
02:53:10,000 --> 02:53:12,280
And yet, bro, still, still...

4651
02:53:12,280 --> 02:53:13,500
Oh man, he's gonna love this.

4652
02:53:13,620 --> 02:53:16,960
Bro, he's gonna freak out if we rearrange all the chairs, bro.

4653
02:53:18,680 --> 02:53:19,680
Rearrange the chairs?

4654
02:53:20,020 --> 02:53:20,960
What are they gonna look like?

4655
02:53:20,980 --> 02:53:21,480
Just like...

4656
02:53:21,480 --> 02:53:23,220
They're gonna look so disorderly.

4657
02:53:23,260 --> 02:53:23,660
Yeah, yeah.

4658
02:53:23,660 --> 02:53:26,300
We're gonna be like, this isn't my chair.

4659
02:53:26,380 --> 02:53:32,060
Oh my god, bro, we gotta like move the desk like just one centimeter like up or something.

4660
02:53:32,120 --> 02:53:34,140
And then people are gonna be like, whoa, that's weird.

4661
02:53:34,340 --> 02:53:35,200
This doesn't feel right.

4662
02:53:35,200 --> 02:53:36,060
Oh my god, there's stamina.

4663
02:53:36,340 --> 02:53:36,800
There's stamina.

4664
02:53:36,820 --> 02:53:38,200
The door seems not to...

4665
02:53:40,180 --> 02:53:42,880
Can't prank our senior prank, man.

4666
02:53:43,540 --> 02:53:44,580
Senior prank?

4667
02:53:44,800 --> 02:53:47,200
We're doing our fucking senior prank right now, bro.

4668
02:53:47,320 --> 02:53:48,560
Oh, this is an invisible wall.

4669
02:53:49,020 --> 02:53:50,480
Where the fuck's the key, man?

4670
02:53:51,940 --> 02:53:55,320
I think this is the door over... over here.

4671
02:53:55,680 --> 02:53:57,000
Is that the door, bro?

4672
02:53:57,060 --> 02:53:57,500
Oh yeah.

4673
02:53:57,680 --> 02:53:58,700
Bro, bro, is this it?

4674
02:53:59,200 --> 02:54:00,020
Oh, bro!

4675
02:54:00,660 --> 02:54:03,400
We're gonna... he's not gonna expect this!

4676
02:54:04,280 --> 02:54:06,800
Principal Wally's gonna get so mad, bro.

4677
02:54:06,920 --> 02:54:07,020
Oh my god.

4678
02:54:07,020 --> 02:54:09,340
This kid doesn't have a backpack he needs?

4679
02:54:09,620 --> 02:54:10,140
Oh my god.

4680
02:54:10,360 --> 02:54:12,640
Oh my god, bro, Principal Wally's not gonna expect this.

4681
02:54:12,640 --> 02:54:15,260
Why are the toilets just like out of the open?

4682
02:54:16,040 --> 02:54:17,400
No way, bro.

4683
02:54:19,100 --> 02:54:20,820
Is this how boys live their life?

4684
02:54:20,900 --> 02:54:22,860
Is there just like toilets with no doors?

4685
02:54:22,980 --> 02:54:26,920
Yeah, I mean, when they pee with the urinals, you don't need doors.

4686
02:54:28,380 --> 02:54:29,960
That doesn't even look like a urinal.

4687
02:54:29,980 --> 02:54:31,400
That's like a straight up toy toy.

4688
02:54:32,000 --> 02:54:33,900
Look, it's... look, there's budget cuts.

4689
02:54:33,960 --> 02:54:35,860
This is not a very good school.

4690
02:54:37,060 --> 02:54:39,120
Bro, this is a big boys' locker.

4691
02:54:39,160 --> 02:54:40,920
Oh my god, you look like the monster.

4692
02:54:41,240 --> 02:54:41,560
I think it's me as best as particles.

4693
02:54:42,320 --> 02:54:45,880
Your fucking head looks like the fucking monster.

4694
02:54:47,380 --> 02:54:48,440
Bro, bro, bro!

4695
02:54:49,360 --> 02:54:49,760
Bro!

4696
02:54:49,860 --> 02:54:50,900
Bro, I got to the gym, bro!

4697
02:54:51,560 --> 02:54:55,280
Oh my god, we're gonna spray paint this place.

4698
02:54:55,980 --> 02:54:57,360
I need to get to the other side.

4699
02:54:57,440 --> 02:54:58,580
Wait, why is there grass in the gym?

4700
02:54:58,580 --> 02:55:00,220
Yeah, why is there... what the fuck?

4701
02:55:00,680 --> 02:55:01,860
What's wrong with this gym?

4702
02:55:02,200 --> 02:55:03,000
Also, why...

4703
02:55:03,000 --> 02:55:05,880
Did I forgot to bring my glasses or something?

4704
02:55:06,080 --> 02:55:06,940
Like, why...

4705
02:55:06,940 --> 02:55:07,000
He adds 10 m higher.

4706
02:55:07,000 --> 02:55:09,120
Why is it blurry in front of me?

4707
02:55:10,220 --> 02:55:12,900
I got that depth of field eye around me.

4708
02:55:12,900 --> 02:55:15,640
Yeah, bro, I forgot to bring my glasses, man.

4709
02:55:15,900 --> 02:55:16,880
This is embarrassing.

4710
02:55:17,580 --> 02:55:18,780
A key is needed.

4711
02:55:19,680 --> 02:55:21,140
Yeah, find the key, bro.

4712
02:55:23,100 --> 02:55:25,580
Bro, I don't like the sound of my footsteps here.

4713
02:55:25,860 --> 02:55:28,820
Mine are not as hell, dude, I got pink boots.

4714
02:55:30,320 --> 02:55:32,320
Bro, I think there's mold.

4715
02:55:32,560 --> 02:55:34,420
I think budget cuts hit hard, man.

4716
02:55:35,180 --> 02:55:39,360
Yeah, this is looking... I mean, I kind of like this nature look to it, maybe.

4717
02:55:39,480 --> 02:55:39,700
You know?

4718
02:55:39,940 --> 02:55:40,860
That's kind of...

4719
02:55:40,860 --> 02:55:41,700
No, I found the pool!

4720
02:55:42,240 --> 02:55:43,600
Oh, you get the key?

4721
02:55:44,520 --> 02:55:46,300
No, but I found the pool, man!

4722
02:55:47,140 --> 02:55:47,980
That's ominous.

4723
02:55:48,060 --> 02:55:49,000
Don't fucking drown.

4724
02:55:49,200 --> 02:55:49,820
Do you know how to swim?

4725
02:55:50,240 --> 02:55:50,860
Oh, I do.

4726
02:55:51,040 --> 02:55:52,080
But I failed swimming class.

4727
02:55:52,180 --> 02:55:54,940
I failed my swimming lessons like three times in a row.

4728
02:55:55,220 --> 02:55:57,080
Because I couldn't do the frog.

4729
02:55:58,260 --> 02:55:59,100
The frog?!

4730
02:55:59,100 --> 02:56:00,800
Was it the frog and the butterfly?

4731
02:56:00,840 --> 02:56:01,500
I don't know.

4732
02:56:01,600 --> 02:56:03,740
Is the frog and the butterfly the same thing?

4733
02:56:04,420 --> 02:56:06,340
But I failed it like three times in a row.

4734
02:56:06,540 --> 02:56:08,140
And then my parents gave up.

4735
02:56:09,340 --> 02:56:10,920
Oh, you're swimming there?

4736
02:56:10,960 --> 02:56:12,380
Like, okay, I guess you'll drown.

4737
02:56:12,600 --> 02:56:17,420
They didn't want to... They didn't want to keep like, Oh my god, this kid plays Valorant!

4738
02:56:17,560 --> 02:56:17,940
Bro.

4739
02:56:20,200 --> 02:56:20,640
Bro.

4740
02:56:22,200 --> 02:56:23,300
I like this cat.

4741
02:56:24,280 --> 02:56:25,620
Oh my god, that's Crowfeather!

4742
02:56:29,460 --> 02:56:30,340
That's Crowfeather.

4743
02:56:30,440 --> 02:56:30,980
What does it say?

4744
02:56:31,420 --> 02:56:36,360
Cherry blossoms bloom upon the arrival of the something new...

4745
02:56:36,920 --> 02:56:38,040
I know that character.

4746
02:56:38,160 --> 02:56:38,720
That's woman.

4747
02:56:39,920 --> 02:56:41,860
The arrival of the woman time.

4748
02:56:42,320 --> 02:56:43,240
Something women.

4749
02:56:43,360 --> 02:56:43,940
Cherry blossoms bloom.

4750
02:56:44,960 --> 02:56:46,940
Average high school ex- It smells in here.

4751
02:56:47,140 --> 02:56:48,540
No wonder this is a horror game.

4752
02:56:49,340 --> 02:56:50,640
There's a Sova player.

4753
02:56:50,920 --> 02:56:52,360
Oh my god, there's like trash bags.

4754
02:56:54,500 --> 02:56:56,140
Alright, we gotta go back.

4755
02:56:56,620 --> 02:56:59,140
Why do they have a computer room right next to the pool?

4756
02:56:59,480 --> 02:57:01,080
Bro, this guy's a freak, man.

4757
02:57:02,420 --> 02:57:03,760
Where the fuck is the key?

4758
02:57:04,520 --> 02:57:06,360
There's another door over here.

4759
02:57:08,460 --> 02:57:09,400
In this shed?

4760
02:57:09,880 --> 02:57:11,280
Oh, is there anything in the shed?

4761
02:57:11,640 --> 02:57:12,840
Surely nothing bad would happen in a shed.

4762
02:57:13,360 --> 02:57:13,760
Oh.

4763
02:57:14,400 --> 02:57:15,320
Oh, there's the key.

4764
02:57:16,500 --> 02:57:18,900
From the key now I can open the gym door.

4765
02:57:19,040 --> 02:57:27,000
Does it not go in my- Oh, it just stays there for- Jesus, every time I look at your face it's- Same about you!

4766
02:57:27,340 --> 02:57:29,220
You look so fucking smug!

4767
02:57:29,480 --> 02:57:34,740
Like, every time I look at your face, it's like, there's this giant fucking cat person beside me.

4768
02:57:37,500 --> 02:57:37,940
Oh.

4769
02:57:38,380 --> 02:57:40,620
Apparently we have to find the cherry blossom key.

4770
02:57:42,000 --> 02:57:43,320
This is not the right one?

4771
02:57:43,580 --> 02:57:44,120
Oh, the tree?

4772
02:57:44,680 --> 02:57:46,300
This is a gym, so it should be.

4773
02:57:48,000 --> 02:57:48,900
Alright, here we go.

4774
02:57:48,940 --> 02:57:50,060
We gotta go to the gym now.

4775
02:57:50,400 --> 02:57:51,780
Can we die in this game?

4776
02:57:51,880 --> 02:57:52,720
I assume we can.

4777
02:57:53,560 --> 02:57:56,140
I- I think we can?

4778
02:57:56,580 --> 02:57:57,020
Probably?

4779
02:57:57,340 --> 02:57:59,720
This looks like we would be at risk of like, death, yeah?

4780
02:57:59,720 --> 02:58:00,100
Yeah.

4781
02:58:00,280 --> 02:58:02,060
I think- Should be how.

4782
02:58:02,220 --> 02:58:03,140
This is how we die.

4783
02:58:03,380 --> 02:58:03,440
Oh god.

4784
02:58:03,660 --> 02:58:04,880
My feet scared me.

4785
02:58:05,180 --> 02:58:07,800
On the other side.

4786
02:58:10,820 --> 02:58:11,380
Don't worry.

4787
02:58:12,600 --> 02:58:14,400
The witch can't show up now!

4788
02:58:14,720 --> 02:58:15,820
We're still in the beginning.

4789
02:58:18,100 --> 02:58:20,200
Oh, we have infinite lives, so it doesn't matter.

4790
02:58:21,560 --> 02:58:22,140
It's here.

4791
02:58:22,220 --> 02:58:22,580
How do you know?

4792
02:58:22,860 --> 02:58:25,360
Cause I- Oh, there's the cherry blossom key!

4793
02:58:25,700 --> 02:58:26,360
A tree.

4794
02:58:26,540 --> 02:58:27,060
Oh, it's so pretty.

4795
02:58:27,060 --> 02:58:29,560
Oh, maybe we start the monster at the cherry blossom.

4796
02:58:30,160 --> 02:58:32,080
It started cold drinks.

4797
02:58:32,920 --> 02:58:34,040
Alright, let's go.

4798
02:58:34,240 --> 02:58:34,360
I'll offer her.

4799
02:58:35,680 --> 02:58:36,500
Oh, that's her!

4800
02:58:36,760 --> 02:58:39,180
How does Sakura tree grow in the middle of nowhere?

4801
02:58:41,500 --> 02:58:42,520
That's freaky.

4802
02:58:42,620 --> 02:58:45,260
How did it- Now this is me at 3am.

4803
02:58:45,540 --> 02:58:47,460
This is you at 3am.

4804
02:58:48,000 --> 02:58:49,200
What the fuck are you doing?

4805
02:58:49,200 --> 02:58:50,020
Get that string cheese from me!

4806
02:58:50,120 --> 02:58:51,000
From the fridge!

4807
02:58:51,520 --> 02:58:54,860
What the fuck are you doing?

4808
02:58:54,860 --> 02:58:55,880
Alright, open the door.

4809
02:58:57,060 --> 02:58:57,160
Okay.

4810
02:58:58,400 --> 02:59:00,060
She likes to mimic them.

4811
02:59:00,240 --> 02:59:00,800
Be cautious.

4812
02:59:01,040 --> 02:59:02,100
Don't let yourself be deceived.

4813
02:59:02,220 --> 02:59:03,980
Turn back now before it's too late.

4814
02:59:04,100 --> 02:59:04,460
Leon?

4815
02:59:04,660 --> 02:59:05,780
Who the fuck is Leon?

4816
02:59:06,820 --> 02:59:07,300
Leon?

4817
02:59:07,300 --> 02:59:07,720
Leon, help!

4818
02:59:08,080 --> 02:59:08,660
What are you doing?

4819
02:59:08,740 --> 02:59:09,900
This isn't Resident Evil 4.

4820
02:59:12,360 --> 02:59:14,280
Wait, what is- she likes to mimic them?

4821
02:59:15,000 --> 02:59:17,420
Do not let yourself be- I hate this.

4822
02:59:17,420 --> 02:59:21,280
I hate hearing people that's- Oh my god, what the fuck?

4823
02:59:21,280 --> 02:59:22,060
That was a blow dryer.

4824
02:59:22,260 --> 02:59:24,340
That scared the shit out of me.

4825
02:59:25,020 --> 02:59:29,980
Okay, we- Maybe we should have like a code to like reassure if this is like you and me.

4826
02:59:30,480 --> 02:59:30,880
Bro!

4827
02:59:30,980 --> 02:59:31,960
Bro, they have Gucci bags!

4828
02:59:32,540 --> 02:59:34,040
Oh, is this what Gucci is?

4829
02:59:34,260 --> 02:59:34,860
Yeah, that's Gucci!

4830
02:59:35,320 --> 02:59:35,760
Oh my god.

4831
02:59:35,820 --> 02:59:36,100
In Sanrio?

4832
02:59:36,240 --> 02:59:37,520
They have Gucci in Sanrio.

4833
02:59:38,700 --> 02:59:40,760
Is this what Gucci is?

4834
02:59:42,600 --> 02:59:44,040
I'm getting everything- Woah!

4835
02:59:44,400 --> 02:59:44,800
Woah!

4836
02:59:47,200 --> 02:59:48,060
Did you see that?

4837
02:59:49,260 --> 02:59:51,420
Oh, I just like static in my ears.

4838
02:59:51,460 --> 02:59:53,960
I thought my like- my hearing aid just malfunctioned.

4839
02:59:54,560 --> 02:59:55,040
That was terrible.

4840
02:59:55,040 --> 02:59:56,100
What the fuck?

4841
02:59:56,360 --> 02:59:57,440
What did you see?

4842
02:59:57,440 --> 02:59:58,320
Did you see something?

4843
02:59:58,580 --> 02:59:59,820
Yeah, I saw something.

4844
02:59:59,980 --> 03:00:02,800
I think I made fun of this man's Gucci bag and he got mad.

4845
03:00:03,860 --> 03:00:04,560
That's real.

4846
03:00:05,200 --> 03:00:07,060
That's a real- real school experience.

4847
03:00:08,080 --> 03:00:09,300
I don't like that.

4848
03:00:09,440 --> 03:00:10,520
Oh, Doki behind us!

4849
03:00:10,800 --> 03:00:13,520
Oh, she mad.

4850
03:00:13,700 --> 03:00:14,300
She angry.

4851
03:00:15,480 --> 03:00:16,260
Nobody's perfect.

4852
03:00:16,340 --> 03:00:17,860
That's why pencils have erasers.

4853
03:00:17,960 --> 03:00:18,400
Oh my god.

4854
03:00:20,760 --> 03:00:21,540
She's gone.

4855
03:00:21,820 --> 03:00:23,900
You showed her your key and she left.

4856
03:00:24,180 --> 03:00:25,020
Oh, she's gone.

4857
03:00:25,960 --> 03:00:27,340
I showed you my key.

4858
03:00:27,440 --> 03:00:28,120
Please respond.

4859
03:00:29,340 --> 03:00:31,180
I'm gonna insert this somewhere.

4860
03:00:33,920 --> 03:00:35,340
Where was a locked door?

4861
03:00:35,400 --> 03:00:35,960
This one?

4862
03:00:36,520 --> 03:00:38,660
Wait, so do you actually have hearing aids?

4863
03:00:39,460 --> 03:00:39,900
No.

4864
03:00:41,620 --> 03:00:42,480
No, I'm good.

4865
03:00:42,500 --> 03:00:43,780
I've got good hearing.

4866
03:00:43,980 --> 03:00:44,480
I'm good hearing.

4867
03:00:44,600 --> 03:00:46,120
Okay, I'm gonna say, what the fuck did you do?

4868
03:00:46,740 --> 03:00:48,600
No, it just sounded like static.

4869
03:00:48,780 --> 03:00:49,720
Oh, there's a hole in me.

4870
03:00:50,000 --> 03:00:50,380
What's this?

4871
03:00:50,460 --> 03:00:53,480
Hey, if you're reading this, I don't know much.

4872
03:00:56,020 --> 03:00:56,420
Alright,

4873
03:01:11,400 --> 03:01:11,960
let's go in there.

4874
03:01:12,320 --> 03:01:13,720
I picked up a couple keys.

4875
03:01:13,960 --> 03:01:16,260
They gotta be a little bit more like... descriptive.

4876
03:01:17,240 --> 03:01:18,640
I picked up key number two.

4877
03:01:18,820 --> 03:01:19,220
Oh...

4878
03:01:19,220 --> 03:01:20,920
How the fuck did we get here?

4879
03:01:21,880 --> 03:01:23,020
Loading chain... Whoa!

4880
03:01:23,600 --> 03:01:25,260
Okay, I can really use these glasses.

4881
03:01:25,720 --> 03:01:27,480
I need these glasses, man.

4882
03:01:29,440 --> 03:01:33,000
Why is there a fucking pool with trees under here?

4883
03:01:35,220 --> 03:01:36,960
Oh, yeah, well... I feel like...

4884
03:01:37,540 --> 03:01:40,060
I feel like I'm gonna get... Wait, what the fuck is that?

4885
03:01:40,340 --> 03:01:41,480
Oh god, I got goosebumps.

4886
03:01:41,800 --> 03:01:42,540
What the fuck is that?

4887
03:01:42,600 --> 03:01:43,020
Do you see that?

4888
03:01:44,500 --> 03:01:44,940
I...

4889
03:01:45,440 --> 03:01:46,300
Do you see that?

4890
03:01:47,660 --> 03:01:49,280
I... It's a... It's the woman!

4891
03:01:49,600 --> 03:01:50,440
Is that the woman?

4892
03:01:51,080 --> 03:01:52,060
It's the woman.

4893
03:01:52,100 --> 03:01:53,340
What are you doing here?

4894
03:01:53,620 --> 03:01:55,120
It's not real, it's not real!

4895
03:01:55,220 --> 03:01:56,080
Women are REAL!

4896
03:01:58,680 --> 03:01:59,920
What are you doing here?!

4897
03:02:00,520 --> 03:02:08,260
Name three non-protect- What happened?

4898
03:02:11,820 --> 03:02:12,960
Are you okay?

4899
03:02:13,960 --> 03:02:15,980
I don't think she liked that, dude.

4900
03:02:16,040 --> 03:02:18,100
I called her out on her fucking gamer blog.

4901
03:02:23,980 --> 03:02:25,740
Alright, opening that door!

4902
03:02:26,600 --> 03:02:28,420
Thank god we got this permakini.

4903
03:02:28,740 --> 03:02:29,980
Are we in Japan now?

4904
03:02:30,020 --> 03:02:33,120
No, we're in... no, this is not Japan.

4905
03:02:33,500 --> 03:02:34,580
This is...

4906
03:02:34,580 --> 03:02:36,900
This looks like one of those silly games.

4907
03:02:37,220 --> 03:02:38,220
This is not Japan!

4908
03:02:38,740 --> 03:02:42,840
These are not Japanese characters, unless they're kanji.

4909
03:02:48,660 --> 03:02:49,920
Oh no, we're in Japan!

4910
03:02:50,060 --> 03:02:51,000
That's not kanji.

4911
03:02:51,000 --> 03:02:51,620
Okay, yeah.

4912
03:02:51,720 --> 03:02:53,560
Oh my god, they took us to Japan!

4913
03:02:56,800 --> 03:02:58,820
There's two bookstores next to each other?

4914
03:02:58,840 --> 03:02:59,660
I don't know if my mom was okay with this, dude.

4915
03:02:59,720 --> 03:03:01,460
I didn't sign a release.

4916
03:03:01,460 --> 03:03:04,340
Oh my god, did you sign the permission form from your mom?

4917
03:03:05,100 --> 03:03:06,360
I forged it.

4918
03:03:06,480 --> 03:03:07,080
I forged it.

4919
03:03:07,300 --> 03:03:08,380
You forged your signature?

4920
03:03:09,080 --> 03:03:09,520
Bro!

4921
03:03:11,580 --> 03:03:12,400
That's not cool.

4922
03:03:12,480 --> 03:03:14,160
There's three bookstores back to back.

4923
03:03:14,280 --> 03:03:16,860
This is not a very smart business decision.

4924
03:03:17,200 --> 03:03:18,800
It is a school trip.

4925
03:03:18,880 --> 03:03:20,460
Maybe we're in a library section.

4926
03:03:21,000 --> 03:03:22,120
Oh hey, there's another...

4927
03:03:30,200 --> 03:03:32,300
Okay, that was so cheap.

4928
03:03:32,320 --> 03:03:34,160
That was such a cheap jump.

4929
03:03:34,260 --> 03:03:40,280
That was fucking... That was like a 2009... Like I just opened a YouTube video and... Bro, we got like FNAF, man.

4930
03:03:40,280 --> 03:03:42,360
There was a car driving down the street.

4931
03:03:44,240 --> 03:03:47,650
The fuck?

4932
03:03:47,650 --> 03:03:48,450
Oh my god.

4933
03:03:48,490 --> 03:03:50,410
That was so cheap, man.

4934
03:03:50,830 --> 03:03:53,330
Oh yeah, that's not... Yeah, fuck you.

4935
03:03:53,350 --> 03:03:54,270
Fuck you, man.

4936
03:03:54,270 --> 03:03:56,230
This is not FNAF, man.

4937
03:03:58,210 --> 03:03:59,150
Oh my god.

4938
03:03:59,210 --> 03:04:00,010
Alright, next door.

4939
03:04:00,090 --> 03:04:00,570
Next door.

4940
03:04:01,450 --> 03:04:03,310
Apparently we die in this next part.

4941
03:04:04,250 --> 03:04:04,890
Oh yeah?

4942
03:04:05,090 --> 03:04:06,570
I have the key to the hidden door.

4943
03:04:06,890 --> 03:04:08,830
Is this like run for your life kind of moment?

4944
03:04:08,930 --> 03:04:09,970
Am I finally gonna use my stamina?

4945
03:04:11,330 --> 03:04:12,190
Wait, I hear people.

4946
03:04:13,170 --> 03:04:15,010
I think we're gonna die, Snuffy.

4947
03:04:16,030 --> 03:04:19,370
I think... I think we're gonna die, Snuffy.

4948
03:04:20,210 --> 03:04:21,350
Just stay to the right.

4949
03:04:21,410 --> 03:04:22,130
Just stay to the right.

4950
03:04:22,190 --> 03:04:22,670
You don't leave.

4951
03:04:22,730 --> 03:04:23,530
That's the maze trap, right?

4952
03:04:23,590 --> 03:04:24,290
Stay to the right.

4953
03:04:24,370 --> 03:04:24,890
Yeah, maze trap.

4954
03:04:25,170 --> 03:04:26,030
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4955
03:04:28,090 --> 03:04:28,610
Okay.

4956
03:04:29,010 --> 03:04:30,110
I don't like this.

4957
03:04:30,110 --> 03:04:30,630
I don't hear her anymore yet.

4958
03:04:31,030 --> 03:04:32,650
I don't like this, Snuffy.

4959
03:04:32,810 --> 03:04:34,530
I don't feel so good.

4960
03:04:34,830 --> 03:04:37,310
I think she's around the corner.

4961
03:04:37,490 --> 03:04:38,890
I don't feel so good.

4962
03:04:41,630 --> 03:04:42,930
It's a big maze.

4963
03:04:43,070 --> 03:04:43,570
What the...

4964
03:04:44,150 --> 03:04:46,970
Snuffy, maybe Roblox games can be scary.

4965
03:04:47,570 --> 03:04:48,190
Oh yeah?

4966
03:04:48,270 --> 03:04:49,690
Yeah, you're feeling the stress?

4967
03:04:50,070 --> 03:04:50,350
Uh oh.

4968
03:04:50,450 --> 03:04:51,050
Uh oh.

4969
03:04:51,070 --> 03:04:51,650
Uh oh.

4970
03:04:51,650 --> 03:04:52,150
Uh oh.

4971
03:04:52,230 --> 03:04:52,650
Uh oh.

4972
03:04:55,530 --> 03:04:56,570
I just...

4973
03:04:58,570 --> 03:04:59,930
Oh my god.

4974
03:04:59,990 --> 03:05:03,290
I just... I just see you fucking just fall.

4975
03:05:04,130 --> 03:05:06,730
You just... You just... You just...

4976
03:05:09,130 --> 03:05:13,430
She just fucking touches you and then you fucking just fell.

4977
03:05:14,990 --> 03:05:18,550
It was literally like a tall woman standing emoji.

4978
03:05:18,610 --> 03:05:20,610
Just like she just stood there and...

4979
03:05:21,290 --> 03:05:24,150
I saw a woman and died.

4980
03:05:25,210 --> 03:05:26,510
Oh my god.

4981
03:05:27,190 --> 03:05:27,510
You...

4982
03:05:28,570 --> 03:05:31,370
Okay, one more time.

4983
03:05:31,450 --> 03:05:31,910
One more time.

4984
03:05:31,950 --> 03:05:33,110
Let me see if I can get through this.

4985
03:05:33,130 --> 03:05:33,550
Let's see.

4986
03:05:33,610 --> 03:05:34,110
Okay, let's do this.

4987
03:05:34,110 --> 03:05:35,110
I don't think that was right.

4988
03:05:35,150 --> 03:05:35,990
I think that was a dead end.

4989
03:05:36,090 --> 03:05:36,930
I think so too.

4990
03:05:37,370 --> 03:05:37,690
Alright.

4991
03:05:38,650 --> 03:05:40,990
We can do this together as a team.

4992
03:05:41,030 --> 03:05:41,810
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4993
03:05:41,950 --> 03:05:42,750
Wait, what do you think?

4994
03:05:42,810 --> 03:05:43,310
What do you... Oh, wait.

4995
03:05:43,370 --> 03:05:43,650
What's this?

4996
03:05:43,950 --> 03:05:43,970
Here.

4997
03:05:43,970 --> 03:05:44,530
It has to be here.

4998
03:05:44,650 --> 03:05:45,710
There's like stuff here.

4999
03:05:46,490 --> 03:05:47,190
It's a dead man.

5000
03:05:47,250 --> 03:05:47,390
There's a key.

5001
03:05:47,390 --> 03:05:47,550
There's a key.

5002
03:05:47,710 --> 03:05:48,450
Yeah, I got the key.

5003
03:05:49,070 --> 03:05:49,670
Key two.

5004
03:05:49,810 --> 03:05:50,490
Okay, key two.

5005
03:05:50,650 --> 03:05:51,410
I got key three.

5006
03:05:51,510 --> 03:05:52,970
No, it's called... What is key three?

5007
03:05:52,970 --> 03:05:54,050
Oh, key three.

5008
03:05:54,210 --> 03:05:54,690
Yeah, yeah.

5009
03:05:54,770 --> 03:05:55,750
Okay, but where's the door?

5010
03:05:56,350 --> 03:05:57,570
I didn't see a door.

5011
03:05:58,370 --> 03:05:59,370
I didn't see...

5012
03:06:00,210 --> 03:06:01,610
Wait, how do we hide from her?

5013
03:06:01,770 --> 03:06:02,450
Like, what's the mechanism?

5014
03:06:02,670 --> 03:06:03,250
I don't know.

5015
03:06:03,370 --> 03:06:07,710
Well, okay, she has to go to one of us and then whoever lives...

5016
03:06:08,630 --> 03:06:09,890
Run past her.

5017
03:06:12,690 --> 03:06:13,690
This is a trap.

5018
03:06:14,270 --> 03:06:16,170
Oh my god, I'm so scared.

5019
03:06:17,830 --> 03:06:18,870
Oh, here we go.

5020
03:06:21,190 --> 03:06:22,850
We have to look for the doors.

5021
03:06:22,990 --> 03:06:23,730
Okay, let's go.

5022
03:06:24,250 --> 03:06:24,790
Okay, okay.

5023
03:06:25,130 --> 03:06:25,490
Alright.

5024
03:06:26,970 --> 03:06:27,330
Door.

5025
03:06:27,330 --> 03:06:28,530
Where the door at?

5026
03:06:29,510 --> 03:06:32,210
I wonder if it's the same area always.

5027
03:06:32,590 --> 03:06:33,530
Oh, the last one.

5028
03:06:33,550 --> 03:06:34,210
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

5029
03:06:37,090 --> 03:06:39,750
So it's like, I know this game like the back of my hand.

5030
03:06:39,850 --> 03:06:40,010
Oh.

5031
03:06:40,790 --> 03:06:41,830
Bro, what the fuck?

5032
03:06:41,850 --> 03:06:42,790
There's so many games.

5033
03:06:42,930 --> 03:06:43,130
Why...

5034
03:06:43,130 --> 03:06:44,050
Wait, where did you go?

5035
03:06:44,150 --> 03:06:45,090
Where did you go?

5036
03:06:46,570 --> 03:06:47,570
I got scared.

5037
03:06:48,870 --> 03:06:49,390
I'm scared too.

5038
03:06:49,730 --> 03:06:50,210
I'm dead.

5039
03:06:50,270 --> 03:06:50,550
I'm dead.

5040
03:06:50,610 --> 03:06:50,910
I'm dead.

5041
03:06:50,950 --> 03:06:51,230
I'm dead.

5042
03:06:51,250 --> 03:06:51,590
I'm dead.

5043
03:06:51,590 --> 03:06:51,950
I'm dead.

5044
03:06:51,950 --> 03:06:52,630
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

5045
03:06:52,650 --> 03:06:52,770
I'm dead.

5046
03:06:53,170 --> 03:06:53,510
I'm dead.

5047
03:06:53,570 --> 03:06:53,870
I'm dead.

5048
03:06:53,950 --> 03:06:54,310
I'm dead.

5049
03:06:54,350 --> 03:06:55,010
I don't know...

5050
03:06:55,370 --> 03:06:56,590
I don't know where you are.

5051
03:06:56,630 --> 03:06:57,010
I'm dead.

5052
03:06:57,050 --> 03:06:57,390
I'm dead.

5053
03:06:57,410 --> 03:06:57,750
I'm dead.

5054
03:06:57,770 --> 03:06:58,030
I'm coming.

5055
03:06:58,130 --> 03:06:58,390
I'm coming.

5056
03:06:58,410 --> 03:06:58,710
I'm coming.

5057
03:06:58,730 --> 03:06:59,650
Where are you?

5058
03:06:59,830 --> 03:07:00,910
Where are you, Snuffy?

5059
03:07:01,010 --> 03:07:01,490
I'm dead.

5060
03:07:02,210 --> 03:07:02,690
Uh-oh.

5061
03:07:04,530 --> 03:07:05,150
Oh, no.

5062
03:07:05,210 --> 03:07:05,990
Where am I?

5063
03:07:06,070 --> 03:07:07,570
I'm in several dead ends.

5064
03:07:07,590 --> 03:07:08,310
We split up.

5065
03:07:08,770 --> 03:07:10,050
What happened to teamwork?

5066
03:07:11,250 --> 03:07:11,750
I'm coming.

5067
03:07:11,830 --> 03:07:12,010
I'm coming.

5068
03:07:12,870 --> 03:07:13,530
I'm not coming.

5069
03:07:13,570 --> 03:07:14,290
I'm not coming anymore.

5070
03:07:14,430 --> 03:07:14,790
I'm not coming.

5071
03:07:19,350 --> 03:07:23,330
Oh my god oh my god oh my god ok you can run you can't run from her you can you can you can you can!

5072
03:07:26,990 --> 03:07:29,390
I'm back in the beginning!

5073
03:07:29,630 --> 03:07:31,290
I'm back in the beginning I'm back in the beginning!

5074
03:07:32,650 --> 03:07:33,650
No no no.

5075
03:07:35,050 --> 03:07:36,170
Ran right out!

5076
03:07:36,430 --> 03:07:37,730
I just ran out.

5077
03:07:39,390 --> 03:07:40,510
You found it though!

5078
03:07:40,610 --> 03:07:41,170
You found it?!

5079
03:07:41,170 --> 03:07:42,150
Yeah yeah yeah yeah.

5080
03:07:42,230 --> 03:07:43,730
Where is it?!

5081
03:07:43,730 --> 03:07:47,070
If you go over can I just die a comb to you?!

5082
03:07:47,450 --> 03:07:48,170
I think so.

5083
03:07:48,170 --> 03:07:50,250
So... Is it to the right or to the left?

5084
03:07:50,690 --> 03:07:51,990
It was to the left.

5085
03:07:52,510 --> 03:07:53,650
It's to the... Oh!

5086
03:07:54,570 --> 03:07:55,370
You did it!

5087
03:07:55,810 --> 03:07:56,410
Oh, nice!

5088
03:07:57,330 --> 03:07:59,770
Just one of us has to find it.

5089
03:08:01,290 --> 03:08:02,710
We did it!

5090
03:08:02,710 --> 03:08:03,050
Yay!

5091
03:08:04,310 --> 03:08:05,310
I contributed.

5092
03:08:06,710 --> 03:08:09,630
Look, I found the key, you found the door.

5093
03:08:10,290 --> 03:08:10,850
Yeah, yeah.

5094
03:08:11,490 --> 03:08:12,610
She chased me.

5095
03:08:12,670 --> 03:08:13,650
That was fucking scary.

5096
03:08:13,830 --> 03:08:15,970
She literally... The funniest thing is like, she doesn't do anything.

5097
03:08:15,970 --> 03:08:17,970
She just like stands, like standing like...

5098
03:08:17,970 --> 03:08:20,910
You have like a Discord, like a...

5099
03:08:20,910 --> 03:08:22,390
stabilizer thing or something.

5100
03:08:22,630 --> 03:08:26,510
So when you start screaming, it was just static because it was so loud.

5101
03:08:27,950 --> 03:08:29,830
Let me check my Discord settings.

5102
03:08:29,990 --> 03:08:30,530
Oh my God.

5103
03:08:30,810 --> 03:08:32,090
It was just like...

5104
03:08:32,610 --> 03:08:34,830
It was just like, what the fuck?

5105
03:08:34,970 --> 03:08:35,330
Sorry!

5106
03:08:35,830 --> 03:08:36,550
Oh my God.

5107
03:08:36,550 --> 03:08:37,390
Oh my God, wait.

5108
03:08:38,210 --> 03:08:39,450
You start playing music.

5109
03:08:40,950 --> 03:08:42,650
Oh, I have echo cancellation.

5110
03:08:42,930 --> 03:08:43,970
Oh yeah, noise suppression.

5111
03:08:44,370 --> 03:08:45,550
Automatic game control.

5112
03:08:45,970 --> 03:08:46,910
All this shit.

5113
03:08:46,970 --> 03:08:47,830
Oh my God, no.

5114
03:08:48,130 --> 03:08:49,550
It is so funny.

5115
03:08:50,050 --> 03:08:51,630
I'm so fucking sorry.

5116
03:08:51,770 --> 03:08:52,110
Oh my God.

5117
03:08:52,110 --> 03:08:54,070
My Discord audio is probably so terrible.

5118
03:08:54,390 --> 03:08:56,310
Discord shakes fresh and early.

5119
03:08:57,130 --> 03:08:57,730
Dang it.

5120
03:08:57,770 --> 03:08:57,950
Okay.

5121
03:08:58,510 --> 03:08:59,570
There she is.

5122
03:09:00,210 --> 03:09:01,670
You first, m'lady.

5123
03:09:02,010 --> 03:09:02,450
What?

5124
03:09:02,610 --> 03:09:03,930
I just... I did the last one.

5125
03:09:03,930 --> 03:09:04,350
You go ahead.

5126
03:09:04,450 --> 03:09:05,430
Okay, fine, fine.

5127
03:09:05,530 --> 03:09:06,750
I'm gonna go to the left.

5128
03:09:06,770 --> 03:09:07,350
There's no way.

5129
03:09:08,250 --> 03:09:09,530
Oh my God.

5130
03:09:09,610 --> 03:09:10,010
Okay.

5131
03:09:13,570 --> 03:09:15,650
I didn't give her eye contact.

5132
03:09:15,970 --> 03:09:16,290
See?

5133
03:09:16,290 --> 03:09:18,290
She didn't hurt me because I didn't look.

5134
03:09:19,170 --> 03:09:21,030
It was just text jump scare.

5135
03:09:21,130 --> 03:09:22,290
Yeah, it was just text.

5136
03:09:23,110 --> 03:09:24,230
Okay, where do we go?

5137
03:09:24,390 --> 03:09:25,510
Talk to the farmer.

5138
03:09:25,830 --> 03:09:26,150
Talk to the farmer.

5139
03:09:26,630 --> 03:09:27,690
Where would the farmer be?

5140
03:09:28,370 --> 03:09:29,650
Where's the farmer's daughter?

5141
03:09:30,310 --> 03:09:30,750
Whoa.

5142
03:09:31,610 --> 03:09:33,310
Oh, we're gonna walk and dead this?

5143
03:09:33,310 --> 03:09:33,390
I have a bag.

5144
03:09:33,390 --> 03:09:36,090
I have an inventory, but there ain't no inventory.

5145
03:09:36,210 --> 03:09:37,830
Well, I haven't picked up anything but keys, dude.

5146
03:09:37,990 --> 03:09:40,030
We're gonna walk and dead this farmer.

5147
03:09:40,470 --> 03:09:41,930
Walk and dead this farmer?

5148
03:09:41,950 --> 03:09:43,050
Yeah, let's eat his legs.

5149
03:09:44,790 --> 03:09:45,730
Oh, I found it.

5150
03:09:45,730 --> 03:09:45,950
Oh, I found it.

5151
03:09:45,950 --> 03:09:47,850
We're gonna... Wait, where are you?

5152
03:09:48,070 --> 03:09:49,410
I haven't seen you around before.

5153
03:09:49,550 --> 03:09:50,190
Oh, there's the farmer.

5154
03:09:51,470 --> 03:09:51,910
Hello.

5155
03:09:51,910 --> 03:09:52,930
We're not from here.

5156
03:09:54,050 --> 03:09:55,490
It says click to continue.

5157
03:09:55,650 --> 03:09:57,350
Oh, well, please be careful around here.

5158
03:09:57,410 --> 03:10:00,050
My brother recently went into the city and he hasn't been back since.

5159
03:10:00,090 --> 03:10:02,150
I don't know how much longer I'll be able to stay here.

5160
03:10:02,230 --> 03:10:04,690
She's probably already watching us as I speak.

5161
03:10:04,730 --> 03:10:07,950
If you've seen a lady playing the Biwa, it's already too late.

5162
03:10:08,710 --> 03:10:09,530
We did!

5163
03:10:10,370 --> 03:10:11,650
I did see that lady.

5164
03:10:11,650 --> 03:10:12,850
We saw that lady together.

5165
03:10:13,430 --> 03:10:13,650
Can I...

5166
03:10:13,650 --> 03:10:14,110
Yeah.

5167
03:10:14,490 --> 03:10:15,630
How about I live here?

5168
03:10:15,630 --> 03:10:16,770
And bring her here with you?

5169
03:10:16,870 --> 03:10:18,130
I guess we go straight, right?

5170
03:10:19,110 --> 03:10:20,010
I guess so.

5171
03:10:20,170 --> 03:10:21,090
Why are we being haunted?

5172
03:10:21,210 --> 03:10:22,130
Because we picked up a key?

5173
03:10:22,650 --> 03:10:24,790
Explore the cave, search for the door.

5174
03:10:25,450 --> 03:10:25,770
Again?

5175
03:10:26,450 --> 03:10:27,490
That's because like...

5176
03:10:27,490 --> 03:10:30,050
Bro, I just wanted to do my senior prank, man.

5177
03:10:30,810 --> 03:10:31,690
Senior prank?

5178
03:10:31,990 --> 03:10:33,330
This is a different type of senior prank.

5179
03:10:33,330 --> 03:10:34,610
Now we travel to Japan.

5180
03:10:36,330 --> 03:10:39,730
Accidentally showed up into the cursed lands of the Japanese farmhouses.

5181
03:10:39,930 --> 03:10:44,990
Oh, I don't like this.

5182
03:10:45,830 --> 03:10:47,610
I think these are the weeping angels.

5183
03:10:48,830 --> 03:10:50,810
Is that like a Doctor Who thing?

5184
03:10:50,990 --> 03:10:52,030
Yeah, I think that's the...

5185
03:10:52,030 --> 03:10:56,170
Like you have to have eye contact with them or they're gonna start fucking coming over to us.

5186
03:10:56,290 --> 03:10:57,230
I don't know.

5187
03:10:57,530 --> 03:10:59,090
Are you a Doctor Who fan?

5188
03:10:59,610 --> 03:11:00,890
I watched Doc...

5189
03:11:00,890 --> 03:11:01,570
Oh, they are!

5190
03:11:01,910 --> 03:11:02,630
They are!

5191
03:11:02,630 --> 03:11:04,210
They are the weeping angels!

5192
03:11:04,410 --> 03:11:05,650
I'm fucking doing it!

5193
03:11:05,650 --> 03:11:06,950
I'm fucking doing it!

5194
03:11:10,810 --> 03:11:11,870
What was that?

5195
03:11:12,050 --> 03:11:13,050
Oh my god, another dead person.

5196
03:11:13,190 --> 03:11:13,750
Is this the brother?

5197
03:11:14,350 --> 03:11:15,130
No, it's a woman.

5198
03:11:15,930 --> 03:11:16,670
Another dead woman.

5199
03:11:16,670 --> 03:11:18,070
I knew it was weeping angel.

5200
03:11:18,570 --> 03:11:21,090
There was no other explanation why they were stones.

5201
03:11:22,730 --> 03:11:23,930
Oh, there's more of them.

5202
03:11:23,970 --> 03:11:24,650
Oh my god, there's more of them.

5203
03:11:25,370 --> 03:11:26,030
Oh, oh.

5204
03:11:26,130 --> 03:11:26,990
Look at them!

5205
03:11:29,550 --> 03:11:30,690
I don't think they...

5206
03:11:30,690 --> 03:11:32,710
I don't think they stop moving if you look at them though.

5207
03:11:33,710 --> 03:11:34,510
Oh, oh.

5208
03:11:35,290 --> 03:11:35,690
Oh.

5209
03:11:38,270 --> 03:11:38,670
Oh.

5210
03:11:39,230 --> 03:11:39,630
Oh.

5211
03:11:40,070 --> 03:11:40,470
Oh.

5212
03:11:40,930 --> 03:11:41,330
Oh.

5213
03:11:42,090 --> 03:11:42,490
Oh.

5214
03:11:42,490 --> 03:11:42,510
Oh.

5215
03:11:42,510 --> 03:11:42,810
Oh.

5216
03:11:43,690 --> 03:11:43,710
Oh.

5217
03:11:43,710 --> 03:11:43,790
They're everywhere.

5218
03:11:43,790 --> 03:11:43,890
Oh, they're everywhere.

5219
03:11:43,890 --> 03:11:44,150
In your...

5220
03:11:44,150 --> 03:11:44,770
In your mic!

5221
03:11:46,590 --> 03:11:47,210
Oh, are you?

5222
03:11:47,290 --> 03:11:48,090
Oh my god, I'm sorry...

5223
03:11:48,090 --> 03:11:48,270
I think so.

5224
03:11:48,270 --> 03:11:48,410
Oh.

5225
03:11:49,310 --> 03:11:49,670
I'm so...

5226
03:11:49,670 --> 03:11:50,070
Yes, let's...

5227
03:11:50,070 --> 03:11:51,290
Yes, you just stand there.

5228
03:11:52,510 --> 03:11:53,410
Oh, no, no, no, no!

5229
03:11:53,750 --> 03:11:54,110
Truth!

5230
03:11:54,270 --> 03:11:54,570
Truth!

5231
03:11:57,710 --> 03:11:58,430
Oh god.

5232
03:11:59,170 --> 03:12:00,530
Oh god, my stamina.

5233
03:12:00,530 --> 03:12:01,150
Wait, am I going backwards?

5234
03:12:01,250 --> 03:12:01,590
Oh god.

5235
03:12:01,750 --> 03:12:03,290
I don't know, I'm going forwards.

5236
03:12:04,370 --> 03:12:08,190
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah.

5237
03:12:12,970 --> 03:12:13,690
We're trying to...

5238
03:12:13,690 --> 03:12:14,570
I don't know where I am.

5239
03:12:14,990 --> 03:12:16,510
I don't remember which way I was going.

5240
03:12:17,150 --> 03:12:17,950
Oh, don't worry.

5241
03:12:18,050 --> 03:12:19,610
One of us has to make it.

5242
03:12:19,670 --> 03:12:21,430
If I die, you're gonna have to figure it out though.

5243
03:12:22,910 --> 03:12:23,590
Did I do it?

5244
03:12:28,610 --> 03:12:29,730
I think it was this way.

5245
03:12:29,730 --> 03:12:30,430
I think I'm going the wrong way.

5246
03:12:30,490 --> 03:12:31,050
I think it was this way.

5247
03:12:31,050 --> 03:12:31,710
I think it was this way.

5248
03:12:31,730 --> 03:12:32,330
I'm gonna go this way.

5249
03:12:35,250 --> 03:12:36,550
Oh, there's the crazy lady!

5250
03:12:36,770 --> 03:12:38,750
Oh, every time I look at her, I get goosebumps!

5251
03:12:41,010 --> 03:12:42,250
I'm in the house, Nuffy!

5252
03:12:43,690 --> 03:12:45,130
The original one or the new one?

5253
03:12:45,210 --> 03:12:45,590
I don't know!

5254
03:12:45,850 --> 03:12:46,170
New house?

5255
03:12:46,350 --> 03:12:46,890
New house!

5256
03:12:47,070 --> 03:12:48,570
I don't even... I'm in... I'm in the...

5257
03:12:49,510 --> 03:12:50,310
The crumbly...

5258
03:12:50,310 --> 03:12:50,850
New house!

5259
03:12:52,830 --> 03:12:55,110
Looks like that is the only place to go.

5260
03:12:55,270 --> 03:12:56,430
I can go left.

5261
03:12:58,710 --> 03:12:59,570
Don't worry, Nuffy.

5262
03:12:59,670 --> 03:13:00,990
I'm gonna beat this game for us.

5263
03:13:01,470 --> 03:13:02,250
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

5264
03:13:02,290 --> 03:13:03,610
I didn't!

5265
03:13:03,690 --> 03:13:04,410
Oh, I thought I died.

5266
03:13:04,470 --> 03:13:04,930
Oh, thank god!

5267
03:13:06,050 --> 03:13:07,670
We're in the hotel?!

5268
03:13:08,230 --> 03:13:10,270
From Japan to a hotel?!

5269
03:13:11,310 --> 03:13:16,270
We're getting a tour of the city, a beautiful garden, and now we get a full expense paid trip to a hotel.

5270
03:13:16,270 --> 03:13:16,690
Oh my god!

5271
03:13:18,890 --> 03:13:19,870
I hate this game.

5272
03:13:24,430 --> 03:13:25,510
Wait, what's this?

5273
03:13:25,790 --> 03:13:26,650
What's... who's...

5274
03:13:27,290 --> 03:13:28,130
Chat with...

5275
03:13:28,690 --> 03:13:30,410
Chat with hamburger...

5276
03:13:30,410 --> 03:13:33,150
Who the fuck is hamburger?!

5277
03:13:33,150 --> 03:13:33,350
Sheesh!

5278
03:13:35,290 --> 03:13:37,310
Bro, she has a Club Penguin shirt.

5279
03:13:37,450 --> 03:13:38,830
This is all her doing, man.

5280
03:13:39,250 --> 03:13:40,250
Who is she?

5281
03:13:41,070 --> 03:13:41,830
Oh, you go.

5282
03:13:41,830 --> 03:13:42,290
I don't know!

5283
03:13:44,390 --> 03:13:45,410
What is she doing?

5284
03:13:46,010 --> 03:13:47,190
Japanese myth I have heard about.

5285
03:13:47,250 --> 03:13:50,190
I don't recall much about it, but I do know she can bring you anywhere she pleases.

5286
03:13:50,210 --> 03:13:52,210
Eventually, those targeted by her fall into madness.

5287
03:13:52,510 --> 03:13:53,350
Are you into madness?

5288
03:13:53,450 --> 03:13:54,310
You're like a penguin.

5289
03:13:54,710 --> 03:13:55,530
Clapping on the floor.

5290
03:13:55,670 --> 03:13:56,970
She's like a Club Penguin fan.

5291
03:13:57,430 --> 03:13:58,070
Hamburger cheese.

5292
03:13:59,210 --> 03:14:00,990
Is this like a real person or is this just like...

5293
03:14:00,990 --> 03:14:01,610
I feel so.

5294
03:14:01,630 --> 03:14:03,070
Maybe it's like a Make-A-Wish.

5295
03:14:04,530 --> 03:14:06,350
Her Make-A-Wish is to... I mean...

5296
03:14:06,350 --> 03:14:07,490
Okay, is it fucked up?

5297
03:14:07,530 --> 03:14:11,890
Because like she's in a wheelchair and I was like, maybe her Make-A-Wish is to be in a Roblox game.

5298
03:14:12,590 --> 03:14:15,510
Like, is that... is that fucked up for me to say?

5299
03:14:15,870 --> 03:14:16,290
Like...

5300
03:14:17,550 --> 03:14:18,390
I... I...

5301
03:14:18,390 --> 03:14:19,730
It's... I don't know!

5302
03:14:19,750 --> 03:14:20,850
I'm just wondering!

5303
03:14:21,950 --> 03:14:24,410
Like, why is there like hamburger...

5304
03:14:24,410 --> 03:14:26,350
Why is there a freaking hamburger cheese?

5305
03:14:26,730 --> 03:14:29,550
I mean, I think that like maybe it's somebody in the lobby or something.

5306
03:14:29,630 --> 03:14:32,210
It just like picks a player that was like in the same lobby.

5307
03:14:32,210 --> 03:14:32,630
But she's in the wheelchair!

5308
03:14:33,510 --> 03:14:34,070
Where are you?

5309
03:14:34,070 --> 03:14:34,770
Oh my god, Doki, wait.

5310
03:14:35,350 --> 03:14:37,010
I... I can't stay here.

5311
03:14:37,470 --> 03:14:38,570
My presence is...

5312
03:14:38,570 --> 03:14:39,890
My presence is being hunted.

5313
03:14:40,390 --> 03:14:41,030
Wait, what?

5314
03:14:41,110 --> 03:14:41,870
Is that you over there?

5315
03:14:45,320 --> 03:14:46,180
Is that you over there?

5316
03:14:46,920 --> 03:14:47,460
Ohhhh!

5317
03:14:47,840 --> 03:14:48,560
She's on me!

5318
03:14:49,420 --> 03:14:50,720
She's on me now!

5319
03:14:53,010 --> 03:14:53,860
Did you die?

5320
03:14:55,020 --> 03:14:57,620
No, no, she just kinda stopped coming for me.

5321
03:14:58,000 --> 03:14:59,140
Oh my god, dude.

5322
03:14:59,140 --> 03:14:59,880
I hear her.

5323
03:14:59,940 --> 03:15:01,360
Bro she's, she's fucking...

5324
03:15:01,360 --> 03:15:04,280
Fucking playing that fucking guitar right now behind me.

5325
03:15:04,480 --> 03:15:05,860
She's literally strumming!

5326
03:15:05,860 --> 03:15:07,540
She's strumming on that guitar!

5327
03:15:09,080 --> 03:15:09,620
Menacingly.

5328
03:15:09,660 --> 03:15:11,500
No, no, nooooooo!

5329
03:15:11,500 --> 03:15:12,300
AHHHHHHHHHH!!!!

5330
03:15:13,600 --> 03:15:15,920
Thank you for the elevator music.

5331
03:15:17,520 --> 03:15:18,560
Where are you?

5332
03:15:21,800 --> 03:15:23,080
Where did you go?

5333
03:15:23,300 --> 03:15:25,200
I don't know what to do.

5334
03:15:25,340 --> 03:15:27,240
She's like impossible to avoid.

5335
03:15:30,400 --> 03:15:36,540
Oh She's actually only capable of moving in a singular direction.

5336
03:15:36,820 --> 03:15:38,880
Bro, where the fuck are you?

5337
03:15:40,100 --> 03:15:41,700
I'm about to win us a game.

5338
03:15:43,120 --> 03:15:46,200
I hate this bro.

5339
03:15:46,340 --> 03:15:48,220
Whoever suggested this fucking game.

5340
03:15:48,300 --> 03:15:49,280
Fuck you man.

5341
03:15:50,420 --> 03:15:52,480
You didn't come with me to the next floor.

5342
03:15:52,820 --> 03:15:53,340
I did.

5343
03:15:53,360 --> 03:15:54,880
I was already in the next floor.

5344
03:15:54,960 --> 03:15:57,420
I got I got there before you got there.

5345
03:15:57,700 --> 03:15:58,800
Oh, I thought you died.

5346
03:15:58,960 --> 03:16:00,000
I thought that's why you screamed.

5347
03:16:00,380 --> 03:16:02,160
What are there's a look at this maze.

5348
03:16:02,300 --> 03:16:03,000
Did you see this map?

5349
03:16:03,100 --> 03:16:04,580
Oh my god, there's a map?

5350
03:16:05,440 --> 03:16:06,200
Take a look.

5351
03:16:07,580 --> 03:16:08,760
I hate this game.

5352
03:16:08,880 --> 03:16:10,460

5353
03:16:11,520 --> 03:16:18,480
Okay, so simply okay so Bro, I fucking hate this these cheap jump scares.

Take a left.

5356
03:16:20,620 --> 03:16:21,200
Take a right.

5357
03:16:21,300 --> 03:16:21,800
Take a left.

5358
03:16:21,940 --> 03:16:22,860
Take a take a straight.

5359
03:16:22,960 --> 03:16:24,300
How do you know where to go?

5360
03:16:24,680 --> 03:16:25,820
Okay, okay.

5361
03:16:25,960 --> 03:16:27,420
I look there's a map right here.

5362
03:16:27,480 --> 03:16:28,500
You just gotta memorize it.

5363
03:16:28,540 --> 03:16:29,440
Okay, there's a map.

5364
03:16:32,020 --> 03:16:36,000

03:16:39,480 --> 03:16:40,760
Take another left.

5367
03:16:40,920 --> 03:16:41,800
Take a right.

5368
03:16:43,640 --> 03:16:45,300
All right, I'm at it.

5369
03:16:45,420 --> 03:16:46,580

5371
03:16:57,660 --> 03:17:00,340
So we gotta fucking figure out how to do this together.

It's so over.

5403
03:20:13,870 --> 03:20:16,270
I literally hear you running from her.

5404
03:20:19,290 --> 03:20:20,470
It's so over.

5405
03:20:20,550 --> 03:20:21,290

Oh my god, we did it!

5409
03:20:32,650 --> 03:20:34,650
I knew splitting up was the right idea.

5410
03:20:36,890 --> 03:20:38,350
We distracted them.

5411
03:20:38,370 --> 03:20:39,450
We divided their attention.

5412
03:20:39,510 --> 03:20:40,790
We're in my now.

5413
03:20:40,930 --> 03:20:42,630
Divide and conquer.

5414
03:20:42,790 --> 03:20:47,490
Just like my favorite war politician said.

5415
03:20:49,250 --> 03:20:50,790
End of chapter one.

5416
03:20:50,830 --> 03:20:51,330
We did it.

5417
03:20:51,590 --> 03:20:55,150
I think this is a good time to call it.

5418
03:20:55,770 --> 03:20:58,390
We beat the game, guys!

5419
03:20:59,250 --> 03:21:01,050
Guys, we beat the game!

5420
03:21:01,830 --> 03:21:03,230
Oh my god!

5421
03:21:03,350 --> 03:21:04,370
We're gamers!

5422
03:21:05,290 --> 03:21:06,310
Where's the key?

5423
03:21:06,430 --> 03:21:07,170
Where's the key?

5424
03:21:07,890 --> 03:21:09,070
Back to the lobby.

5425
03:21:09,170 --> 03:21:09,550
Let's go.

5426
03:21:10,730 --> 03:21:12,330
Get me out of here.

5427
03:21:12,790 --> 03:21:14,130
Roblox core games, man.

5428
03:21:14,150 --> 03:21:15,070
They need something else.

5429
03:21:15,110 --> 03:21:15,590
Oh my god.

5430
03:21:15,990 --> 03:21:17,010
We beat the game!

5431
03:21:17,030 --> 03:21:19,270
I never trust the recommendations on these.

5432
03:21:19,410 --> 03:21:20,410
Maybe Jump Scare City.

5433
03:21:20,770 --> 03:21:21,970
Oh my god.

5434
03:21:23,070 --> 03:21:24,230
Beat the game.

5435
03:21:24,250 --> 03:21:24,750
The Mimic.

5436
03:21:25,290 --> 03:21:26,650
Another easy win.

5437
03:21:27,430 --> 03:21:28,830
Oh my god.

5438
03:21:29,550 --> 03:21:30,070
GG's.

5439
03:21:30,230 --> 03:21:33,110
Next time I'm taking us to fucking Kitten Simulator.

5440
03:21:40,000 --> 03:21:41,980
Fuck this game, man.

5441
03:21:43,640 --> 03:21:46,120
I was like, it's a Roblox game.

5442
03:21:46,240 --> 03:21:47,080
They're not scary.

5443
03:21:50,880 --> 03:21:52,560
Bro, what did I play?

5444
03:21:53,980 --> 03:21:57,180
It's good to play a game because I just moved into a house for the first time.

5445
03:21:57,220 --> 03:21:58,480
So I'm glad I can scream.

5446
03:21:58,820 --> 03:21:59,140
Yeah.

5447
03:22:00,840 --> 03:22:02,180
Sorry about the echo.

5448
03:22:02,380 --> 03:22:05,360
I'm proud that this room is probably really bad for echo.

5449
03:22:05,360 --> 03:22:05,600
Oh yeah.

5450
03:22:05,700 --> 03:22:05,860
Yeah.

5451
03:22:06,080 --> 03:22:08,880
This is like your first day streaming back to from Apple TV.

5452
03:22:08,880 --> 03:22:09,460
After your move.

5453
03:22:09,860 --> 03:22:10,220
Yeah.

5454
03:22:10,420 --> 03:22:10,760
Yeah.

5455
03:22:11,100 --> 03:22:12,700
And we played Roblox.

5456
03:22:13,480 --> 03:22:13,840
I'm so excited.

5457
03:22:13,840 --> 03:22:14,720
Big Roblox stream.

5458
03:22:14,820 --> 03:22:14,960
Yeah.

5459
03:22:15,120 --> 03:22:16,940
The Roblox stream.

5460
03:22:17,920 --> 03:22:20,360
Christening the new house with a big Roblox stream.

5461
03:22:21,400 --> 03:22:22,940
That was so fun though.

5462
03:22:23,020 --> 03:22:23,920
I had a great time.

5463
03:22:24,680 --> 03:22:25,100
Oh yeah.

5464
03:22:25,160 --> 03:22:25,520
Me too.

5465
03:22:25,620 --> 03:22:27,400
If you ever want to play again, please let me know.

5466
03:22:27,400 --> 03:22:27,640
I have a million of games.

5467
03:22:27,640 --> 03:22:27,880
Oh my god.

5468
03:22:27,920 --> 03:22:28,120
No.

5469
03:22:28,180 --> 03:22:30,380
We should totally play Content Warning.

5470
03:22:31,100 --> 03:22:31,700
Oh yeah.

5471
03:22:31,740 --> 03:22:32,040
Yeah.

5472
03:22:32,260 --> 03:22:32,360
That's...

5473
03:22:32,360 --> 03:22:33,180
I'm so excited.

5474
03:22:33,280 --> 03:22:33,580
Yeah.

5475
03:22:33,600 --> 03:22:34,280
Oh my god.

5476
03:22:34,320 --> 03:22:35,540
We should totally do it.

5477
03:22:35,540 --> 03:22:36,320
That would be so fun.

5478
03:22:36,380 --> 03:22:36,980
You want next week?

5479
03:22:37,640 --> 03:22:37,860
Yeah.

5480
03:22:37,860 --> 03:22:38,020
Yeah.

5481
03:22:38,020 --> 03:22:38,860
Next week we got 4K.

5482
03:22:38,860 --> 03:22:39,100
Yeah.

5483
03:22:39,100 --> 03:22:40,260
We should totally farm it before the game dies.

5484
03:22:40,440 --> 03:22:40,780
Yeah.

5485
03:22:40,960 --> 03:22:41,700
Oh my god.

5486
03:22:41,720 --> 03:22:42,960
I'm totally blind to it.

5487
03:22:43,000 --> 03:22:43,660
So I'll save.

5488
03:22:43,720 --> 03:22:45,340
I'll save my innocence for...

5489
03:22:45,340 --> 03:22:45,780
Yeah.

5490
03:22:45,780 --> 03:22:46,000
Yeah.

5491
03:22:46,000 --> 03:22:46,140
Yeah.

5492
03:22:46,140 --> 03:22:46,520
Me too.

5493
03:22:46,600 --> 03:22:46,860
Me too.

5494
03:22:46,980 --> 03:22:49,460
The only thing I know is that clip I sent.

5495
03:22:52,560 --> 03:22:55,760
I'm sure we will discover more cursed objects.

5496
03:22:55,980 --> 03:22:57,060
That was fantastic.

5497
03:22:57,720 --> 03:22:58,700
Thank you so much.

5498
03:22:58,760 --> 03:22:59,980
This was so much fun.

5499
03:23:00,080 --> 03:23:00,420
It was.

5500
03:23:00,520 --> 03:23:01,460
That was really fun.

5501
03:23:01,500 --> 03:23:03,720
Thanks for giving me the Roblox tour.

5502
03:23:04,260 --> 03:23:05,420
Oh, I'm so excited.

5503
03:23:05,420 --> 03:23:11,040
I was afraid to bring you to some of the darker ones because I was just like, how deep is this like hole going to go?

5504
03:23:11,100 --> 03:23:13,740
Like, how should I introduce somebody who's not seen a lot of games?

5505
03:23:13,940 --> 03:23:15,300
I think you're ready.

5506
03:23:15,380 --> 03:23:18,200
I think you're ready to see how far this Roblox goes.

5507
03:23:18,200 --> 03:23:18,460
Oh yeah.

5508
03:23:18,700 --> 03:23:19,120
Yeah.

5509
03:23:19,340 --> 03:23:19,780
VLAN?

5510
03:23:19,920 --> 03:23:20,360
Yeah.

5511
03:23:22,480 --> 03:23:23,320
I'll figure out.

5512
03:23:23,400 --> 03:23:28,100
I'll get like the, the like a secret internet, like save of VLANs.

5513
03:23:28,100 --> 03:23:28,420
Yeah.

5514
03:23:28,740 --> 03:23:29,180
No!

5515
03:23:30,560 --> 03:23:31,000
No!

5516
03:23:33,260 --> 03:23:35,100
Thank you again, Snuffy.

5517
03:23:35,100 --> 03:23:36,180

Oh my God.

03:23:53,300 --> 03:23:54,040
That was really fun.

5532
03:23:54,400 --> 03:23:55,480
That was actually...

5533
03:23:56,700 --> 03:23:57,660
That was really fun.

5534
03:23:57,800 --> 03:24:01,300
I had a great... this was my first time actually like collabing with Snuffy.

5535
03:24:01,640 --> 03:24:04,660
We've been wanting to do a collab for like a while now.

5536
03:24:05,500 --> 03:24:08,400
Like I said before, at first we wanted to do the Warrior Cats RPG.

5537
03:24:08,480 --> 03:24:08,560
Yeah.

5538
03:24:08,560 --> 03:24:10,900
And then we have like, oh my God, she gone.

5539
03:24:12,180 --> 03:24:13,100
She gone.

5540
03:24:15,360 --> 03:24:18,000
But I'm really happy to be able to talk to her.

5541
03:24:18,080 --> 03:24:21,700
Like the first hour was like, literally like podcast time.

5542
03:24:21,920 --> 03:24:22,340
Oh my gosh.

5543
03:24:22,440 --> 03:24:26,020

Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

And if you stay up for me, head to bed.

5578
