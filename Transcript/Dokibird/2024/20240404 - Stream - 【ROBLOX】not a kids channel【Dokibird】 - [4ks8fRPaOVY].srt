13
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:20,210
You can't say women don't exist.

14
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:20,550
You're right.

15
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:22,490
Women don't even exist in video games.

16
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:22,870
You're right.

17
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:23,710
They're so true.

18
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:25,170
So true, Robo.

19
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:34,110
Guys should know that women aren't real in video games.

20
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:37,230
Women literally aren't even in video games.

21
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:40,090
They're not real.

22
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:41,690
Women aren't real.

23
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:42,710
I got the sensor block.

24
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:54,350
behind every vtuber is a man with a voice changer they were
right they were always right they were always right

25
00:03:54,350 --> 00:04:05,010
everybody who appears at cons yeah those are hired hired
women who pretend to know who pretend to know about video

26
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:11,950
games and vtubers yeah you want to catch one and just walk
up to them and be like okay so you're a girl huh you're paid

27
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:23,590
after video games reading video yeah you like your character
yeah what what's your favorite pokemon game in the pokemon

28
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:33,190
series name three star days from pokemon diamond and para
what what in your opinion what was the most based pokemon

29
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:44,590
protagonist um in your opinion would you smash your pass a
guard of war only women cannot answer this question.

30
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:49,230
Women can really discern the popularity difference between a
low punny and a guard of one.

31
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:57,450
What is the, what is, which Pokemon has the egg type to,

32
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:05,310
Pokemon is sexually compatible based on egg type.

33
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:11,630
And if they can't even answer that, they're not real women.

34
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:14,770
Your maternal instincts should give you the answer already.

35
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:15,790
What?

36
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:23,210
So true, only a real, real man behind me too freaking.

37
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:25,870
God, we've just started 10 minutes.

38
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:28,310
We've gone so far.

39
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:35,530
Oh, oh, oh, Toggy, did you, did you learn to do the, the,
the collab thing where you're like both on the screen

40
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:35,970
together?

41
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:37,170
I don't know, have you done that one?

42
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:38,570
I've done that before.

43
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:39,090
Yeah.

44
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:39,830
Yeah.

45
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:41,730
I always like to do that, but I don't know.

46
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:42,250
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

47
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:43,130
We could do that.

48
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:45,310
You can set it up cause I'm lazy.

49
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:52,690
okay i think i just need to add you on steam if that's oh
yeah yeah yeah let me grab my code it's okay guys we're your

50
00:05:52,690 --> 00:06:00,850
digits now you guys can listen to us set up this so much
more professional you got you got roblox installed already

51
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:10,190
right yeah yeah i got the wait we had to install rob what
okay well it's like it's like a browse it's like a launcher

52
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:16,650
so basically when you click play it's just it'll like boot
up a window it's not really like a program but you do kind

53
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:23,290
of have to do like a little bit of a download okay yeah
that's fine i have fiber we should be good i have five she

54
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:31,970
got those optic cables yeah i was like i was like you have
to doubt i thought it was a browser game what i think i

55
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:39,010
think it used to be but they have they definitely have their
own little like program now okay let me i'm i think like the

56
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:45,610
saddest thing i've ever heard about roblox was when they got
rid of the oof sound because it got copyrighted I thought

57
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:46,490
that that happened.

58
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:47,750
That's so sad.

59
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:50,050
I just feel like you just opened the room.

60
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:55,510
That's when Roblox went downhill.

61
00:06:56,650 --> 00:07:01,890
I live in the constant realization that all games these days
just mimic Roblox.

62
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:04,630
Like all these games, I'm like, this is just Roblox.

63
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:05,330
Like Fortnite.

64
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:06,050
Really?

65
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:06,470
Like what?

66
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:09,190
Like, you know that new one that's come out?

67
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:12,450
Like content warning or like- Oh yeah, content warning.

68
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:13,450
I wanted to try it out.

69
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:14,170
I haven't played it yet.

70
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:15,370
Oh, we should play it sometimes.

71
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:16,770
Yeah, yeah, yeah, me too.

72
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:17,710

warning videos where...

75
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:28,570

82
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:36,190

Studio and it runs way better.

113
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,560
I 100% recommend it.

114
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:53,660
Okay, I'm going to write that.

115
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,320
I'm going to re-watch this bot because I'm not going to
write this down.

116
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:58,220
Time stampers!

117
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,160
I got a set of password.

118
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:05,840
Time stampers, if you're going to post my timestamps in my
YouTube comments, remember to write this one down and put it

119
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,720
in all caps and bold it if you can.

120
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:11,420
Just so I can remember to watch this part.

121
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:18,440
Okay, so it should be wait, what did I make the password?

122
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,640
So I'm going to like, I'm going to invite you to something
and then you just have to put in the password and I think

123
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,660
that's nice.

124
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:27,500
Password is empty.

125
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:35,920
Also, like, one of my one of my dragoons was like, my
favorite description of content warning is is basically

126
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,380
lethal company, but you are Jake Paul.

127
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:41,260

Like, there was no cooling or anything.

00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:12,040
She just mailed a fucking bottle of sauce to random people.

143
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:15,100
So like the sauce was like dripping out or exploding.

before i need i need oh man would you drink from the like

172
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:06,520
the cursed orange dye garfield cup radioactive garfield cup
the radio yes because it's garfield i mean like okay it's

173
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:13,760
just a little as long as i don't build it up you know Don't
don't do it continuously.

174
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:15,660
It should be fine, right?

175
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:16,800
Do it continuously.

176
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:26,240
Yeah, you know, you you have one you can like expose
yourself to radiation like once or some You get like a

177
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:26,920
freebie?

178
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:31,660
Yeah, like a scratch off like one free radioactive Yes,
exactly.

179
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:38,180
Yes, yes as long okay, it's like it's like a bestos, you
know, like

180
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:47,000
Like, you know, when you are exposed to bestows, you get,
you know, you get cancer, you get lung cancer.

181
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:51,920
But if you, you, if you don't continuously expose yourself,
you'll be fine.

182
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:56,440
You just, you know, go into, like, the house, like, for,
like, five seconds, you'll be okay.

183
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,060
Is that how it works?

184
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:01,940
You're just fucking dying.

185
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,480
Is that how it works?

186
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:07,800
It's like, it's like, as soon as you don't breathe in all of
it.

187
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:19,920
if you breathe it in god himself descends upon you and he's
like okay look when bananas have radiation it proves my

188
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:29,520
theory bananas have radiation in them that's not radiation
that's calcium no no no you didn't know that bananas have a

189
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:39,500
little bit of radiation potassium what what okay now you're
coping there's no like i i get california notifications

190
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:44,160
saying that everything i eat has Why would they not tell me
if bananas have fucking radiation?

191
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,800
It's just a little bit.

192
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,160
That's what I'm saying.

193
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:53,680
As long as it's just a little bit of radiation, it's fine.

194
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:55,840
A little bit of radiation as a treat.

195
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:59,620
Yeah, it's just a little, you know, a little treat.

196
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:02,280
See, so it's like, it's so tiny.

197
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,960
The drought is so fucking tiny.

198
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:10,540
But if you eat like 100,000 bananas, maybe it's not, maybe
then it gets a bit worse.

199
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:22,480
and bananas and then you'll die of raining You can I don't
can't connect to this fucking Okay Let me let me let me let

200
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:27,460
me let me walk you through So you click the bottom button
You click the little group of dudes The three little men

201
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:34,800
Yeah, I joined you Join me You type in the password in the
name So you see like I have the password And then I there's

202
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:37,500
the Person name Yeah What does it say?

203
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:45,580
It says Loading or something it just says like it just puts
me in the connecting forever and i had like oh my god i had

204
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:58,700
to like start it oh oh my god i know you wanted to talk
about radiated foods but my brain is fried i was gonna say

205
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:04,100
isn't it funny if you if with that logic you could like
sprinkle a little bit of radiation on each of your foods as

206
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:14,480
like a treat okay but like the thing is 100 acid bananas i
said you it one now you're trying it well imagine if you

207
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:20,040
separate it and you make it into a fraction so one banana
you could still have like a fraction of that banana yeah

208
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:28,160
yeah for bananas yeah i feel like you'll die by the time you
get radiation from bananas i think i think it's fine like

209
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:34,700
you there's no way you're gonna die from the radiation no no
there's no way you you eat enough bananas in your lifetime

210
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:41,540
to get radiation poisoning that's why that's why i'm saying
if there was a Garfield Cup like that's filled with

211
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:49,960
radiation I get one as long as I don't as long as I don't
pass the threshold to get radiation we're fine it was enough

212
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:58,360
radiation to make sure it was like never sold again though
like but I think maybe it was a lot okay but that happened

213
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:06,580
like a long time ago did anyone die from the Garfield Cup no
so we're fine if the people back then didn't die from the

214
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:19,680
also like did you start the thing because i still can't get
i think it's loading oh invited user it's an invalid

215
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:31,680
password what so i didn't fuck it up you fucked it up are
you did you put the password in correctly no i did i what do

216
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:41,000
you mean okay let me let me let me let me try again guys

243
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:37,400

244
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:46,920
banana intake guys yeah yeah and to all you kids out there
who's watching me get the fuck out yeah and your banana

245
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:52,640
intake as well kids yeah it's not a joke it's serious yeah
as many bananas you want you won't get radiation poisoning

246
00:23:52,640 --> 00:24:02,180
if you see Garfield on a cup just walk away no just take one
sip and you'll be fine you get one drink we all get one you

247
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:08,200
know we all get to pick our radiation would that be like
your final like if you were on like death row and they're

248
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:21,560
like you get one last meal give me a fresh cup give me that
garfield cup i want all the food blended into the garfield i

249
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:27,620
want to know what radiation it tastes like i want to
remember garfield and red 40.

250
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:35,320
you didn't you know that like the reason why garfield the
garfield cup was filled with radiation was because of the

251
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:43,100
color orange yeah yeah because it was like oh i don't know
which combination poisonous color it was like orange and

252
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:50,900
green are like you need like radiation to make to make
orange and green back then because that happened for star

253
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:59,360
wars too where like they had to recall a bunch of star wars
cup because it had like orange and green in it oh what wait

254
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:09,580
like oh oh oh c3PO was it like a c3PO cup i have no idea i
just remember i just remember they have to recall a bunch of

255
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:21,600
star wars they're forbidden colors cadmium i'm on i'm on a
i'm on no year meme no year hey guys remember the funny meme

256
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:31,200
when people and kids were getting exposed to radiation so
fucking hilarious this picture says 1978 garfield it's not a

257
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:41,720
pretty life but somebody has to live at mcdonald's mug 99
000 ppm lead causes brain damage plus 5 830 m ppm cadmium

258
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:49,460
causes cancer so it actually wasn't even just cancer you
also get brain damage if you drink garfield how many but

259
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:58,300
like how much you have to drink though like what what what's
the limit before i get right that's really close to like

260
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:06,880
does one sip give me brain damage or was it like you know
several cups like we didn't know the numbers here i feel

261
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:12,200
like we should just we can't we can just have this like test
for ourselves like i'm surprised nobody's who you want to

262
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,820
drink like

263
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:32,520
it's content content yeah it's the cut mondays in my right
april fools happy monday i'm gonna drink five classes of

264
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:41,920
carfield cadmium you know like those like youtube videos
we're over there like uh taste like a tier list of which cup

265
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:56,260
has the most radiation radioactive glassware tier list
actually incredible tearless radioactive glassware which has

266
00:26:56,260 --> 00:27:03,960
the most radiation come and find out as we taste as each
radiated cup i'm like swirling it around like we're trying

267
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:14,200
wine like oh yeah this one really resonates yeah i can taste
a little ready i can feel my brain like fuzzing up and then

268
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:23,120
like somebody get the those fucking like radiation testing
and then like the Geiger counter they had a Geiger counter

269
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:34,340
they're like all right chat let's see how much radiation
this cup has we gotta have like the fallout like rad noise

270
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:34,820
of just like

271
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:50,020
I can feel the lead already eroding my lungs I think that's
like an S tier right there what you think Did you eat lead

272
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:50,920
taste like it did?

273
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:53,200
Like, did you ever eat, like, pencil lead?

274
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:54,000
What?

275
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:01,030
Excuse me?

276
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:03,270
Look, I thought we were acting.

277
00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:04,510
Now I'm not too sure.

278
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:12,040
Is this acting?

279
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:12,840
Is this?

280
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:14,220
Are we still...

281
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:15,040
Are we still...

282
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:20,540
Could you...

283
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:22,460
Could you explain your story?

284
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:24,200
Are you never sure?

285
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:25,820
No, no.

286
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,620
Judging by my reaction, absolutely.

287
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:30,460
What you, judging by reaction, what do you think?

288
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:36,340
I, I thought maybe it was a formative experience for many
people.

289
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:44,600
You know, when you're said school and you're bored, maybe
your pencil broke and you're like, oh, the letters just fell

290
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:44,840
out.

291
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:49,800
You know, it used to just like crack and I don't even
remember what possessed me to do it, but I feel like I was

292
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:52,600
like, well, let me just, let me just eat it.

293
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:55,600
I mean, it's crunchy.

294
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:56,980
It's like eating a tic-tac.

295
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,940
It was like really salty.

296
00:28:59,160 --> 00:28:59,660
That's salty.

297
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,100
It was like sour almost like very chemically.

298
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:04,700
Oh my God.

299
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:07,900
People talk about glue eaters, but you're a fucking lid.

300
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:09,680
You're a smoker.

301
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:14,600
Yeah, dude, I used to like lick it too.

302
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:19,400
After like I started eating it, I used to like, every time I
used to start writing with a pencil, I would like lick it.

303
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:20,380
I would like suck.

304
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:23,280
I feel like you would be like one of the students.

305
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:25,560
my mom would be like, you shouldn't hang out with her.

306
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:34,020
Sorry, like, I saw people in like movies, they always like
writers like lick their pen or something.

307
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:37,840
They like dab their pen, I think, to like get the ink
flowing, but I didn't understand what that meant.

308
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,260
So I would just start like doing that with like pencils.

309
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:43,240
So I would just like dab the pencil onto my tongue.

310
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:50,800
I mean, like, dads are, but like you actively consume the
graphite, don't you?

311
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:58,060
do i just kind of started gnawing on all parts of it i think
i got a little bit of the paint as well

312
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:10,700
i'm chewing on eat it you know i think you are the perfect
person for the tier list yeah yeah we should just have like

313
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:20,240
a toxic product tier list where do you think we should put
the recalled the recalled products tier list oh god the

314
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:24,620
cursed consumer reports what's the best food, dude.

315
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:27,900
Should they recall it?

316
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:36,700
It would be like, so by our judgment, yes, they definitely
should have recalled it.

317
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:41,740
It could be one of them YouTube videos where it's like, now
you have to guess which one is which, and we'll be like,

318
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,460
okay, this one is definitely the recalled.

319
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:44,320
I can taste.

320
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:44,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

321
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:46,640
What?

322
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:50,080
Five items are on the table.

323
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:52,200
Three have been recalled.

324
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:59,780
It is up to Snuffy and Doki to find out which three were
recalled for containing lead.

325
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:03,740
You're like, I'm going to get emails reaching out to me
like, you know what?

326
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,500
I think you'd be great for factory work.

327
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:07,840
Do you want to like test some of our product going on?

328
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:09,340
Like, you want to be a taste testing.

329
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:10,640
Like the product testing.

330
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,580
Quality insurance.

331
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:14,060
You can pay for that too.

332
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,180
I know, maybe I get benefits.

333
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:17,000
Thank God.

334
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:18,440
Yeah.

335
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:24,140
I like how we have yet to play Roblox.

336
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:27,900
Yeah, maybe there's, maybe there's cadmium tasting Roblox
game.

337
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:33,600
Hey guys, you guys like this, this black screen.

338
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:42,580
So we got, we got distracted by, it started, it all started
with the rate, the Garfield Cup.

339
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:45,060
I don't even know how it started.

340
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:50,860
I think we were trying to, you know, there's like, there's
like, you can actually buy radiation items in like, like

341
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:53,240
those like, what was it, those donation stores.

342
00:31:53,460 --> 00:32:00,620
goodwill what like is that is that what they're called in
america the goodwill stores yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

343
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:06,280
the second hand stores because like i there was a youtube
short i get all my information from youtube shorts nowadays

344
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:17,720
but like but like there's there's this like channel that
gets like a gaiga county and they go to like goodwill and

345
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:20,080
they like find all the items

346
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:29,900
Dude, oh my God, I actually, okay, so I actually probably
have something that's good for this, because it's good for,

347
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,880
good for poisoning myself.

348
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:38,100
When I became like independent, I was like, you know what a
big thing about becoming an adult is, is like owning plates.

349
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:40,700
So I went to like a secondhand store to buy some plates.

350
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:43,140
And I was like, oh man, these ones are so cute.

351
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,280
And they're like vintage.

352
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,140
That's so cool.

353
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:46,660
That should have been a warning sign.

354
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:48,480
My plates are from like 1938.

355
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:51,400
Good.

356
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,280
Like Googled it.

357
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:58,900
I was like, oh yeah, what, how plants are these and it told
me that like they're at like high risk like anything 1950 or

358
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:07,040
earlier is like do not consume because it's probably filled
with lead you know so i've i've got like tons of lead yeah

359
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:14,160
tons of wait have you wait you've actually consumed lead no
no well i mean other than from the pencil i'm then too

360
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:19,280
afraid to use them i feel like i'll just have to serve it to
my greatest enemy oh so they're just there for decoration

361
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:27,600
type deal yeah yeah i bought like a to ever eat from them
but maybe i should like okay how many subs in like a little

362
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:44,940
class oh my god before the fta was even funny invented holy
i'm gonna be good dude i'm good i'm great which would

363
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:50,260
suspend you have you had to i mean like listen to that like
self-harm

364
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:56,380
on a Twitter account, SnuffBee has been bad.

365
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:57,800
Oh, no.

366
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:01,260
That'd be way better than half of the bams, though.

367
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:06,360
I'd be so proud if I got banned from drinking from a lead
glass rather than like showing us.

368
00:34:08,140 --> 00:34:16,640
I'd break the norm for VTubers at the first VTuber to get
bad for fucking drinking lead.

369
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:19,560
That's incredible, honestly.

370
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:21,760
Knowing the track record for VTubers.

371
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:29,960
Oh, man there's a first for everything and i'm here to see
it dude guys just remember if you think you have a plate

372
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:37,980
that's really really old make sure maybe don't use it
because most likely back then they use lead or uranium to

373
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:46,980
make the glass away is uranium the green one there's another
green one yeah uranium is a green one yeah yeah okay okay

374
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:50,740
because i was wondering that's the one where they oh yeah
people go to the secondhand stores and they have like the

375
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:58,880
light right yeah they shine the light and see if it i did
that because they had a couple of them and i was like i kind

376
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:04,520
of want that i feel like that'd be fun you never know when
superman might show up and you got to like neutralize them

377
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:19,860
yeah weakness the green crystal the green the kryptonite you
mean the kryptonite i'm just like bro you're right it

378
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:28,060
doesn't do anything to superman it's Look, they might be
both be green, but they're not the same thing.

379
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,300
I thought that was real.

380
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:36,280
This dog is named Crypto.

381
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:40,180
Why would you name your dog, like your weakness, like a gun?

382
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:42,460
Like, imagine naming your cat, like...

383
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:44,700
This is like the most badass thing ever.

384
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:47,860
Because it's like, this is the only thing that can hurt me.

385
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:52,200
Oh, my God.

386
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:53,440
I mean, I would name a dog gun.

387
00:35:53,460 --> 00:36:11,460
I think that's cool They like naming also like people who
named their pets after like like real people named like if

388
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:15,380
you name your dog like Jerry or something hey

389
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:24,540
Where's Jerry Where's Jerry?

390
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:28,000
It's something you're talking about, like, you don't know
where your stepdad was.

391
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,620
Oh, man, where'd Jerry go?

392
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:31,520
I'd miss that guy.

393
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:37,860
But it's like an eight-year-old fucking, like, beagle
walking in and being like, Oh, yeah.

394
00:36:41,690 --> 00:36:43,990
He's like, who's a good boy, Jerry?

395
00:36:44,110 --> 00:36:46,090
You're my good boy, Jerry.

396
00:36:46,350 --> 00:36:47,250
That's right.

397
00:36:50,770 --> 00:36:51,850

427
00:40:11,530 --> 00:40:21,270
or bad okay what do you think if people are like oh no a
horse what there's where does your mind go to my little pony

428
00:40:21,270 --> 00:40:25,530
okay That's the other spectrum.

429
00:40:25,770 --> 00:40:27,350
What's the other side of that?

430
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:28,990
What's the other...

431
00:40:28,990 --> 00:40:30,490
So in the face of this keyboard.

432
00:40:30,830 --> 00:40:33,510
Here you sit on this fucking pony spectrum.

433
00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:34,730
That's one...

434
00:40:34,730 --> 00:40:36,530
That's like one end.

435
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:37,710
That's the left side.

436
00:40:37,830 --> 00:40:40,790
Where do you think the right side of that other side is?

437
00:40:41,210 --> 00:40:42,870
For guiding horses.

438
00:40:44,270 --> 00:40:44,830
Actually, I shouldn't.

439
00:40:44,870 --> 00:40:47,510
I don't feel like I should be talking about this.

440
00:40:49,230 --> 00:40:50,150
Just so you know.

441
00:40:50,470 --> 00:40:52,370
There's a lot of ways that I can be worried right now.

442
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:53,430
That's...

443
00:40:53,570 --> 00:40:56,290
That's not it's it's not a good scene.

444
00:40:56,370 --> 00:41:06,190
I'll just say it's definitely not appropriate for Roblox I'm
pretty sure do not do not search it up Mads don't put me in

445
00:41:06,190 --> 00:41:07,990
Roblox don't put me in the Roblox category.

446
00:41:08,190 --> 00:41:11,130
They're not ready for me Just they were playing games and
demos.

447
00:41:11,810 --> 00:41:12,530
Oh my god.

448
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:15,190
Okay guys, I know we haven't started the Roblox Street.

449
00:41:15,510 --> 00:41:19,730
You know like Twitch contacted me to like headline more of
their Twitch rivals

450
00:41:24,330 --> 00:41:25,490
What is this?

451
00:41:25,830 --> 00:41:35,310
Because like they saw my schedule and they were like, yo,
Doki, do you want to headline the Roblox Twitch Rifle?

452
00:41:37,390 --> 00:41:40,530
So Roblox Twitch Rifle is like just fucking invite me?

456
00:41:46,190 --> 00:41:47,690

think.

Please.

520
00:45:42,010 --> 00:45:43,670
Your whole name is appropriate.

00:45:43,850 --> 00:45:44,310
I don't know...

522
00:45:44,310 --> 00:45:44,990
Please understand.

523
00:45:46,030 --> 00:45:47,310
It's my name.

524
00:45:47,530 --> 00:45:48,450
I hate speech.

525
00:45:49,950 --> 00:45:51,190
I hate speech.

526
00:45:52,830 --> 00:45:53,870
There's no way!

527
00:45:54,690 --> 00:45:56,290
Okay, this one...

528
00:45:56,290 --> 00:45:57,090
This will be good.

529
00:45:57,310 --> 00:45:58,030
That works.

530
00:45:58,530 --> 00:45:58,790
Okay.

531
00:45:59,930 --> 00:46:00,290
Okay.

532
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:03,430
I almost read it out loud.

533
00:46:03,550 --> 00:46:05,190
It's so fucking ridiculous.

534
00:46:05,830 --> 00:46:07,110
Okay, you got invited me.

535
00:46:07,150 --> 00:46:08,070
Oh, I see you!

00:46:08,870 --> 00:46:09,210
Yeah!

537
00:46:09,570 --> 00:46:11,730
Wait, I don't know if that's the right one.

538
00:46:12,010 --> 00:46:12,590
No, okay.

539
00:46:13,250 --> 00:46:15,110
It should say dokey snuffy.

540
00:46:15,570 --> 00:46:16,950
Yeah, yeah, I saw that name.

541
00:46:17,470 --> 00:46:17,790
Okay.

542
00:46:19,630 --> 00:46:20,190
Uh...

543
00:46:22,950 --> 00:46:25,090
Yeah, yeah, I'm in!

544
00:46:25,810 --> 00:46:26,010
Yeah!

545
00:46:26,090 --> 00:46:29,230
Alright, alright guys, we can finally show the screen now.

546
00:46:29,470 --> 00:46:29,810
Yeah!

547
00:46:30,410 --> 00:46:32,990
It took us, it took us a while!

548
00:46:34,790 --> 00:46:36,710
I think this is it, right?

549
00:46:41,310 --> 00:46:44,550
Please use windowed or deck- Wait, what?

550
00:46:45,090 --> 00:46:45,730
Is it this window?

551
00:46:46,570 --> 00:46:47,510
Are you using windowed mode?

552
00:46:47,870 --> 00:46:48,750
Yeah, I am.

553
00:46:49,350 --> 00:46:49,590
Okay.

554
00:46:50,470 --> 00:46:53,310
You do slowly- Oh, oh yeah, are you- capture the game?

555
00:46:53,510 --> 00:46:54,430
Wait, wait, give me a sec.

556
00:46:55,050 --> 00:46:57,170
It says, please use window...

557
00:46:59,910 --> 00:47:02,950
Guys, we are going through some technical difficulty.

558
00:47:03,630 --> 00:47:05,550
Wait, what's the problem?

559
00:47:05,850 --> 00:47:06,530
What's the problem?

560
00:47:06,650 --> 00:47:07,550
Am I not in window?

561
00:47:07,630 --> 00:47:07,950
Oh, wait.

562
00:47:08,070 --> 00:47:08,830
Yeah, I am.

563
00:47:09,070 --> 00:47:10,330
I'm in windowed mode.

564
00:47:11,530 --> 00:47:13,750
Do you have to capture it as a window and not a game?

565
00:47:14,010 --> 00:47:15,470
It didn't work as a game for me.

566
00:47:16,030 --> 00:47:16,250
Oh.

567
00:47:18,410 --> 00:47:19,770
Wait, how the fuck do you do?

568
00:47:21,750 --> 00:47:22,330
Okay, wait.

569
00:47:22,810 --> 00:47:23,770
I figured it out, guys.

570
00:47:24,030 --> 00:47:24,890
I figured it out.

571
00:47:26,230 --> 00:47:26,770
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

572
00:47:26,890 --> 00:47:27,850
Oh, I did it.

573
00:47:27,910 --> 00:47:28,850
I figured it out.

574
00:47:29,050 --> 00:47:29,870
There we go.

575
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:30,950
Now we got it.

576
00:47:31,870 --> 00:47:32,770
Okay, here you go.

577
00:47:34,230 --> 00:47:34,970
Oh, there's our Peter.

578
00:47:36,370 --> 00:47:37,030
There he is.

579
00:47:37,090 --> 00:47:38,010
He's running around.

580
00:47:38,950 --> 00:47:39,750
That's our child.

581
00:47:39,990 --> 00:47:41,150
I'm so happy.

582
00:47:41,390 --> 00:47:42,590
I accidentally zoomed in.

583
00:47:43,970 --> 00:47:45,070
He's so big.

584
00:47:45,290 --> 00:47:46,630
I'm so, give me a sec.

585
00:47:46,970 --> 00:47:48,430
Because, like, my up key is.

586
00:47:50,130 --> 00:47:51,190
Okay, here you go.

587
00:47:51,450 --> 00:47:52,030
Guys, look.

588
00:47:52,110 --> 00:47:52,630
It's our Peter.

589
00:47:52,810 --> 00:47:53,710
It's our child.

590
00:47:54,730 --> 00:47:55,750
Let me zoom.

591
00:47:56,770 --> 00:47:57,710
Okay, here we go.

592
00:47:58,810 --> 00:47:59,130
All right.

593
00:48:00,190 --> 00:48:03,390
After many technical difficulties, we made it.

594
00:48:03,650 --> 00:48:07,270
We finally played robots.

595
00:48:09,110 --> 00:48:09,790
Hurry.

596
00:48:10,550 --> 00:48:12,250
We finally made it.

597
00:48:12,490 --> 00:48:13,390
We made it.

598
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:14,510
Yeah, we're playing a game.

599
00:48:14,790 --> 00:48:14,970
Okay.

600
00:48:15,450 --> 00:48:17,650
Peter slowly loses hunger over time.

601
00:48:17,810 --> 00:48:19,370
Buy burgers to keep him alive.

602
00:48:19,710 --> 00:48:22,330
You can buy burgers at the gas station across the road.

603
00:48:22,830 --> 00:48:23,230
Wait.

604
00:48:23,470 --> 00:48:23,990
Oh, there's me.

605
00:48:24,170 --> 00:48:25,010
Guys, am I beautiful?

606
00:48:29,630 --> 00:48:30,930
You look great.

607
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:32,190
Guys, am I beautiful?

608
00:48:33,070 --> 00:48:36,930
You look like you'd be the most thirsty character on a
horror video or something.

609
00:48:37,310 --> 00:48:37,490
Oh my gosh.

610
00:48:37,910 --> 00:48:38,430
That's great.

611
00:48:38,870 --> 00:48:39,670
Oh, wait, he's dying.

612
00:48:39,870 --> 00:48:40,690
Or Peter's dying.

613
00:48:42,170 --> 00:48:43,290
No, he's only 10.

614
00:48:43,310 --> 00:48:45,010
Oh, he's slowly losing health.

615
00:48:45,310 --> 00:48:45,630
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

616
00:48:45,890 --> 00:48:46,350
What do we do?

617
00:48:47,030 --> 00:48:48,150
How do we save it?

618
00:48:48,150 --> 00:48:49,530
Oh, watch how we're crossing the road.

619
00:48:49,650 --> 00:48:50,350
The cars won't stop.

620
00:48:50,390 --> 00:48:50,970
Will we die?

621
00:48:52,810 --> 00:48:53,870
Oh, I did it.

622
00:48:54,590 --> 00:48:56,710
Oh, nice.

623
00:48:57,210 --> 00:48:58,590
What a giant!

624
00:48:59,430 --> 00:49:02,330
What the fuck, you killed me!

625
00:49:03,610 --> 00:49:04,510
What the fuck?

626
00:49:04,630 --> 00:49:05,590
I did it again.

627
00:49:10,290 --> 00:49:11,770
Bro, okay.

628
00:49:12,210 --> 00:49:14,150
Maybe I should cross the road, too.

629
00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:17,910
I shouldn't have single step.

630
00:49:18,590 --> 00:49:19,100
I should have...

631
00:49:19,750 --> 00:49:21,750
How the fuck did you die?

632
00:49:23,170 --> 00:49:25,350
Okay, I bought two burgers.

633
00:49:26,190 --> 00:49:26,470
Okay.

634
00:49:27,990 --> 00:49:28,590
Boy gear.

635
00:49:29,270 --> 00:49:30,670

01:07:34,520 --> 01:07:35,820

01:07:35,960 --> 01:07:41,960
Okay, we got TV and then we got a, we got another friend.

01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:45,340
Double the birds?

983
01:07:45,480 --> 01:07:46,640
Yeah, double the birds.

984
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:49,560
Okay, let me talk to Joe and threaten him for money.

985
01:07:50,900 --> 01:07:52,820
Okay, he doesn't want to give us money yet.

986
01:07:53,600 --> 01:07:54,340
Okay, the TV's here.

987
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:54,720
The TV.

988
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:55,520
We're getting the TV.

989
01:07:55,640 --> 01:07:56,260
The TV is here?

990
01:07:56,400 --> 01:07:56,700

I'm packing it.

995
01:08:03,140 --> 01:08:03,860
It's beautiful.

996
01:08:04,040 --> 01:08:04,700
Look at that!

997
01:08:05,500 --> 01:08:08,120
Are Peter's gonna grow up big and strong?

998
01:08:08,540 --> 01:08:09,860
Hey, what's this other box?

999
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:10,360
I don't know.

1000
01:08:10,620 --> 01:08:11,020
What did I...

1001
01:08:11,020 --> 01:08:11,520

1002
01:08:11,700 --> 01:08:11,880
The fridge!

1003
01:08:11,980 --> 01:08:12,940
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1004
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:17,640
Guys, guys, you think we're doing a good job raising our
boy?

1005
01:08:19,180 --> 01:08:20,100
He's happy.

1006
01:08:20,280 --> 01:08:20,780
He's happy.

1007
01:08:21,100 --> 01:08:21,580
He's so happy.

1008
01:08:21,700 --> 01:08:22,660
We're giving him a family.

1009
01:08:22,780 --> 01:08:23,960
We're buying him a family.

1010
01:08:24,980 --> 01:08:26,480
If Lois worked harder, he would be even happier.

1011
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:29,300
I like how Lois was cheaper than his child.

1012
01:08:31,740 --> 01:08:33,400
He's not the truth, dude.

1013
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:38,040

01:08:38,040 --> 01:08:41,280

We can get robbed?

1051
01:10:56,660 --> 01:10:57,800
At any moment, I'm ready.

1052
01:10:58,380 --> 01:10:58,780
We're robbed.

1053
01:11:02,480 --> 01:11:03,500
Oh my god.

1054
01:11:03,680 --> 01:11:05,080
I can't believe it.

1055
01:11:05,100 --> 01:11:05,560
Let me know.

1056
01:11:05,740 --> 01:11:06,540
And we're going out.

1057
01:11:06,680 --> 01:11:07,140
We're going out.

1058
01:11:07,240 --> 01:11:07,820
Just let me know.

1059
01:11:07,960 --> 01:11:08,860
I'll let this whole thing.

1060
01:11:09,260 --> 01:11:09,820
Oh, okay.

1061
01:11:09,860 --> 01:11:10,080
No, no.

1062
01:11:10,160 --> 01:11:11,280
That's just our chairs again.

1063
01:11:11,340 --> 01:11:12,420
I got us chairs again.

1064
01:11:13,280 --> 01:11:13,820
Oh my god.

1065
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:15,820
The storm is so scary sounding.

1066
01:11:16,060 --> 01:11:17,560
I got us more chairs.

1067
01:11:19,200 --> 01:11:20,980
Oh, yeah, maybe...

1068
01:11:20,980 --> 01:11:22,300
Wait, they took our phone.

1069
01:11:22,580 --> 01:11:22,740
What?

1070
01:11:23,060 --> 01:11:24,040
Wait, they took our phone?

1071
01:11:24,040 --> 01:11:24,620
We can't call anybody.

1072
01:11:24,940 --> 01:11:26,120
We took the fucking phone.

1073
01:11:26,600 --> 01:11:29,540
Okay, apparently, if you close the door, you can't get
robbed.

1074
01:11:29,640 --> 01:11:31,120
You know, that's actually a good idea.

1075
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:34,280
You can just leave our door open.

1076
01:11:34,620 --> 01:11:35,660
You're so irresponsible.

1077
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:38,120
We're irresponsible.

1078
01:11:38,620 --> 01:11:40,760
This is a group effort here.

1079
01:11:41,360 --> 01:11:42,620
We can't have...

1080
01:11:42,620 --> 01:11:45,380
We are both responsible for our peters.

1081
01:11:46,060 --> 01:11:46,840
for Peter.

1082
01:11:47,020 --> 01:11:48,120
He might wander outside.

1083
01:11:48,440 --> 01:11:51,160
He might walk outside and get hit by a car.

1084
01:11:54,840 --> 01:11:57,200
How could you do this to our son?

1085
01:11:58,520 --> 01:11:59,460
Okay, wait, let's see.

1086
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:00,460
Why do we buy a new phone?

1087
01:12:01,180 --> 01:12:02,780
Oh, I got pier.

1088
01:12:03,040 --> 01:12:04,940
We can fish now.

1089
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:14,660
Somebody said in the Razor Peter meta, did you know there is
a Razor Peter meta, and they said that we should grab a

1090
01:12:14,660 --> 01:12:15,340
fishing pier?

1091
01:12:17,280 --> 01:12:24,440
If we want to be very efficient in raising our Peter, we
need to get a peer.

1092
01:12:26,340 --> 01:12:28,140
Just remember to close the door.

1093
01:12:29,560 --> 01:12:30,660
Don't worry, guys.

1094
01:12:30,860 --> 01:12:31,680
I'm going to close the door.

1095
01:12:32,180 --> 01:12:33,180
Guys, do not worry.

1096
01:12:33,780 --> 01:12:35,640
It's not just about raising Peters.

1097
01:12:35,880 --> 01:12:36,580
We're just...

1098
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:40,440
No, wait, wait, wait.

1099
01:12:40,620 --> 01:12:41,800
It's kind of like you walked away.

1100
01:12:41,880 --> 01:12:43,380
Did you close like a real door?

1101
01:12:43,680 --> 01:12:43,820
Yeah.

1102
01:12:46,840 --> 01:12:48,600
But I got the fishing pier.

1103
01:12:48,720 --> 01:12:50,060
Where the fuck is the pier?

1104
01:12:51,040 --> 01:12:52,700
Oh, oh, the fishing pier.

1105
01:12:52,920 --> 01:12:54,260
I thought you said the fishing Peter.

1106
01:12:54,420 --> 01:12:55,800
I was like, we get double the Peters.

1107
01:12:56,300 --> 01:12:57,380
Wait, where the fuck is it?

1108
01:12:57,560 --> 01:12:58,820
Like a fishing thing.

1109
01:12:59,180 --> 01:13:00,380
Yeah, I'll try crossing the road.

1110
01:13:00,640 --> 01:13:01,720
Where's our fishing thing?

1111
01:13:03,140 --> 01:13:05,980
I saw it like show up on my street.

1112
01:13:06,440 --> 01:13:07,580
It's across the street.

1113
01:13:08,740 --> 01:13:10,560
Why is our thing across the street?

1114
01:13:10,900 --> 01:13:11,260
Oh!

1115
01:13:12,840 --> 01:13:13,680
Oh no.

1116
01:13:14,760 --> 01:13:15,640
Fishing rod.

1117
01:13:16,220 --> 01:13:17,880
You got a fishing rod.

1118
01:13:19,780 --> 01:13:20,920
How do I get one?

1119
01:13:22,280 --> 01:13:23,660
Don't go outside.

1120
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:25,240
Can I aim?

1121
01:13:25,360 --> 01:13:25,940
I'm fishing.

1122
01:13:26,180 --> 01:13:26,600
I'm going to fish.

1123
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:27,440
Okay.

1124
01:13:28,140 --> 01:13:28,760
We must.

1125
01:13:30,240 --> 01:13:31,320
Just be careful.

1126
01:13:31,900 --> 01:13:32,840
Is it coming to the house?

1127
01:13:32,980 --> 01:13:33,820
Oh, it's getting delivered.

1128
01:13:34,760 --> 01:13:35,640
Oh, it's getting delivered?

1129
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:36,280
Okay.

1130
01:13:36,860 --> 01:13:38,140
Well, I'm going to close the door soon.

1131
01:13:38,680 --> 01:13:39,800
I don't want to get robbed again.

1132
01:13:39,960 --> 01:13:40,600
I have...

1133
01:13:40,600 --> 01:13:41,740
We don't have a gun yet.

1134
01:13:41,820 --> 01:13:43,920

1223
01:20:31,980 --> 01:20:39,140
They actually okay This might be a little on the on the on
the on the on the point here There was a world that was

1224
01:20:39,140 --> 01:20:46,820
actually in a Roblox sponsor, but it was removed because it
was still a little bit adult for them, but it was basically

1225
01:20:46,820 --> 01:20:48,380
like a woman's...

1226
01:20:48,380 --> 01:20:49,560
What to call this?

1227
01:20:49,840 --> 01:20:58,400
A woman's menstrual and like informational world where you
could change your character model to like a woman's tampon

1228
01:20:58,400 --> 01:21:08,040
and like go down the tubes and all those pieces, parts and
like get a whole like informational like it was practically

1229
01:21:08,040 --> 01:21:15,700
think of it as like a magic school bus like you shrink down
and get to experience like the the the parts of a woman in

I need to talk to everybody.

1710
01:59:53,180 --> 01:59:56,080
Doki Pelt looked around the barn.

1711
01:59:57,040 --> 01:59:59,760
She was still lost in it.

1712
02:00:00,700 --> 02:00:02,640
Trying to pick up a pack of cigarettes.

1713
02:00:02,880 --> 02:00:04,060
Trying to find her way.

1714
02:00:04,360 --> 02:00:10,720
She saw several cats in the, several cats in front of her,
her stomach growled.

1715
02:00:13,660 --> 02:00:16,560
Has anyone seen my mom?

1716
02:00:20,080 --> 02:00:21,820

Why did we all make, why didn't everybody choose their cat
to be Crow Pelt?

1722
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:34,260
Like literally, they're all black cats.

1723
02:00:34,360 --> 02:00:43,960

1731
02:01:24,940 --> 02:01:29,560
Retta's on the couch as she flips.

1768
02:05:07,250 --> 02:05:09,350
More than one year role playing?

1769
02:05:09,930 --> 02:05:20,070
Okay, I would do like high school role play, Neopets role
play, magical fantasy role play.

1770
02:05:20,230 --> 02:05:25,450
And then I would have like character sheets of like
templates of all these Neopets role play.

1771
02:05:25,610 --> 02:05:28,010
There's like a role play board in Neopets.

1772
02:05:30,110 --> 02:05:31,950
That's what I did on Gaia Online.

1773
02:05:32,350 --> 02:05:35,050
They would have like role play guilds and forums that you
could join.

1774
02:05:35,170 --> 02:05:39,170
And then there's like, there's like one where it was like
superheroes, cool roleplay.

1775
02:05:39,310 --> 02:05:40,250
I had so many.

1776
02:05:40,570 --> 02:05:40,750
Superheroes.

1777
02:05:40,970 --> 02:05:40,990
Yeah.

1778
02:05:41,170 --> 02:05:47,890
And then I remember one of them, one of my templates was
like a kid, like what a guy, a guy that knew like telepathy

1779
02:05:47,890 --> 02:05:48,690
or some shit.

1780
02:05:48,890 --> 02:05:50,570
I like telekinesis.

1781
02:05:50,790 --> 02:05:50,870
Oh yeah.

1782
02:05:51,910 --> 02:05:52,310
Telekinesis.

1783
02:05:52,890 --> 02:05:53,770
Oh my god.

1784
02:05:55,250 --> 02:05:57,670
I was on the roleplay leaderboard.

1785
02:05:58,410 --> 02:05:59,810
There's some good stuff then.

1786
02:05:59,950 --> 02:06:02,710
If you, if you're into that, then I have mini a world to
take you.

1787
02:06:02,770 --> 02:06:03,850
Do you want to try different?

1788
02:06:03,950 --> 02:06:04,790
Oh, Roblox world.

1789
02:06:04,810 --> 02:06:05,010
Yeah.

1790
02:06:05,170 --> 02:06:06,370
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1791
02:06:06,610 --> 02:06:06,870
All right.

1792
02:06:07,630 --> 02:06:09,010
Doki Kid signing out.

1793
02:06:11,150 --> 02:06:12,450
Doki Kid leaving.

1794
02:06:12,970 --> 02:06:13,870
That's all this time, right?

1795
02:06:14,690 --> 02:06:17,770
I got fed and I'm okay now.

1796
02:06:23,130 --> 02:06:24,650
Get fed, leaves.

1797
02:06:25,130 --> 02:06:26,210
Actual wild cat RP.

1798
02:06:26,710 --> 02:06:27,910
That really works.

1799
02:06:31,270 --> 02:06:34,070
I got fed, I leave now.

1800
02:06:34,250 --> 02:06:34,650
Goodbye.

1801
02:06:38,270 --> 02:06:39,890
that's all that matters

1802

1804
02:07:02,090 --> 02:07:09,570
called i forget it's something it's something fantasy themed
it's really fun it's like those games where you like have to

1805
02:07:09,570 --> 02:07:15,610
survive like as a character like a animal and like other
animals can eat you and it's basically the role play but

It's like, oh my god.

1815
02:07:41,650 --> 02:07:45,090
Probably one of the oldest classic Roblox games right there.

1816
02:07:45,530 --> 02:07:47,070
A natural disaster survival.

1817
02:07:47,250 --> 02:07:48,670

This one is super fun.

1822
02:07:54,270 --> 02:07:56,110
So instead of a curse game, this is a classic.

1823
02:07:57,630 --> 02:07:57,990
Survival.

1824
02:07:59,110 --> 02:07:59,450

I hope the kids.

1829
02:08:16,300 --> 02:08:19,020
This is all about how much the kids aren't okay.

1830
02:08:19,320 --> 02:08:22,820
This is like, trust your kids on where, if they know where

Take shelter, take shelter.

02:13:50,580 --> 02:13:54,320
This is a real simulation of a pandemic happening right now.

1875
02:13:54,580 --> 02:13:54,840
Oh my god.

1876
02:13:54,840 --> 02:13:55,860
A natural disaster.

1877
02:13:56,260 --> 02:13:58,520
Lady McQueen, he's got to get in the garage.

1878
02:13:58,960 --> 02:14:00,360
He knows how to play this game.

1879
02:14:00,860 --> 02:14:01,660
He's in the garage.

1880
02:14:01,840 --> 02:14:02,560
He has the experience.

1881
02:14:02,920 --> 02:14:05,380
Bro, we're in the Spanish servers.

1882
02:14:06,140 --> 02:14:07,460
We're in the Spanish servers.

1883
02:14:08,280 --> 02:14:08,460
Spanish?

1884
02:14:08,760 --> 02:14:11,760
Yeah, people are speaking Spanish.

1885
02:14:12,520 --> 02:14:13,560
Hello, Mr. McQueen.

I mean, it's really, it actually is.

1889
02:14:22,520 --> 02:14:22,920
Wait, what?

1890
02:14:23,400 --> 02:14:24,240
Oh, my God.

1891
02:14:24,840 --> 02:14:29,680
past the servers so far that he's a Spanish server.

1892
02:14:30,420 --> 02:14:33,000
Oh, yeah.

1893
02:14:36,640 --> 02:14:36,980
Kuchow.

1894
02:14:36,980 --> 02:14:38,880
Is that the other house next door?

1895
02:14:40,240 --> 02:14:41,400
He said Kuchow.

1896
02:14:42,600 --> 02:14:44,040
It's Kuchow.

1897
02:14:44,880 --> 02:14:49,540
Kuchow with a man screaming fire emoji that's him.

1898
02:14:51,280 --> 02:14:52,360
That's Lady McQueen.

1899
02:14:53,420 --> 02:14:57,700
Is that actually the Spanish Wait, it's like a Chao in
Spanish?

1900
02:15:00,980 --> 02:15:02,440
Wait, it is?

1901
02:15:02,900 --> 02:15:04,180
Oh, my God.

1902
02:15:04,400 --> 02:15:05,540
It is Spanish.

1903
02:15:08,400 --> 02:15:10,000
Somebody else repeated him.

1904
02:15:10,140 --> 02:15:11,500
They were like, Chao.

1905
02:15:15,840 --> 02:15:17,060
Oh, my God.

1906
02:15:17,140 --> 02:15:18,180
Did we get here?

1907
02:15:18,680 --> 02:15:19,700
Did you live?

1908
02:15:20,140 --> 02:15:20,760
Did you live?

1909
02:15:21,080 --> 02:15:21,480
Yeah, okay.

1910
02:15:21,700 --> 02:15:22,880
So here's a hack.

1911
02:15:22,980 --> 02:15:26,160
If your health is still injured before the next game starts,
you got to do a hard read.

1912
02:15:26,180 --> 02:15:34,660
set or else you're at an unfair disadvantage and you're

Okay, there's a bit of a cloud front coming in.

1921
02:16:09,600 --> 02:16:11,400
I don't know what the disaster could be.

1922
02:16:11,700 --> 02:16:13,580
Yeah, it looks like dense fog.

1923
02:16:14,240 --> 02:16:19,120
I'm on top of the ceiling to get a good purveying view of
the situation here.

1924
02:16:20,180 --> 02:16:21,020
Back to you, Doki.

02:16:27,680 --> 02:16:28,180
Oh, no.

1929
02:16:28,880 --> 02:16:30,880
What do we do, Mr. McQueen?

1930
02:16:31,920 --> 02:16:33,580
You gotta run his engine.

1931
02:16:33,920 --> 02:16:34,320
Run his engine.

1932

It's like that Hello Kitty.

2107
02:28:36,080 --> 02:28:38,400
What's that Hello Kitty game that self-park advertised?

2108
02:28:39,040 --> 02:28:40,560
Hello Kitty Adventures?

2109
02:28:42,200 --> 02:28:42,900
Is that it?

2110
02:28:43,140 --> 02:28:45,140
Oh, Hello Kitty Island Adventures?

2111
02:28:45,200 --> 02:28:45,660
Yes!

2112
02:28:45,960 --> 02:28:49,540
It's basically like the free version of Hello Kitty Island
Adventures.

2113
02:28:50,380 --> 02:28:52,020
It's actually, it's still a free game.

2114
02:28:52,140 --> 02:28:53,040
I have it on my iPhone.

2115
02:28:53,320 --> 02:28:57,500
If you have, like, an iPod, Apple device, it's free on the
Apple Arcade.

2116
02:28:57,720 --> 02:28:58,940
Oh, whoa.

2117
02:28:59,980 --> 02:29:01,600
I'm not sponsored, by the way.

2118
02:29:01,700 --> 02:29:06,820
But if Hello Kitty Island Adventure would like to sponsor
me, I'm right here.

2119
02:29:07,520 --> 02:29:07,920
Absolutely.

2120
02:29:08,620 --> 02:29:09,420
It's very cute.

2121
02:29:09,580 --> 02:29:10,780
Right here.

2122
02:29:11,460 --> 02:29:12,840
I've never played this one.

2123
02:29:12,980 --> 02:29:13,960
I linked you a new one.

2124
02:29:14,020 --> 02:29:16,160
I never played it, but it looks appetizing.

2125
02:29:16,280 --> 02:29:16,900
It looks very entertaining.

2126
02:29:16,920 --> 02:29:17,920
I'm going to join off of you.

2127
02:29:18,040 --> 02:29:18,560
Give me a sec.

2128
02:29:18,720 --> 02:29:19,420
I'm going to leave.

2129
02:29:22,420 --> 02:29:26,480
I can't believe Hello Kitty Island Adventure didn't win one
game of the year.

2130
02:29:26,740 --> 02:29:28,280
They got so fucking robbed.

2131
02:29:29,200 --> 02:29:29,680
I know.

2132
02:29:29,880 --> 02:29:30,260
I know.

2133
02:29:30,480 --> 02:29:31,260
I was so sad.

2134
02:29:33,520 --> 02:29:36,040
That should have been best mobile game.

2135
02:29:37,040 --> 02:29:38,200
What the fuck is this?

2136
02:29:38,460 --> 02:29:40,680
Let's try to find foods hiding in the house.

2137
02:29:42,220 --> 02:29:42,940
This is us.

2138
02:29:44,660 --> 02:29:46,860
I'm not even in your server.

2139
02:29:47,060 --> 02:29:47,540
What the fuck?

2140
02:29:47,640 --> 02:29:48,100

2141
02:29:48,720 --> 02:29:49,040

Okay.

2144
02:29:57,260 --> 02:29:58,580
What are we trying to do?

2145
02:29:59,420 --> 02:30:01,640
I think it said you have to hide or something.

2146
02:30:02,500 --> 02:30:03,280
Or find food?

2147
02:30:03,700 --> 02:30:04,820

Look at this giant melon.

2349
02:44:25,220 --> 02:44:25,560
Look at him.

2350
02:44:25,620 --> 02:44:28,340
Worth is giving me like a sense of disassociation.

2351
02:44:28,360 --> 02:44:31,600
as I get, like, shoved to the floor and, like, it's hurt.

2352
02:44:31,800 --> 02:44:33,500
And I'm just like, who am I?

02:45:46,020 --> 02:45:48,100
It was, it was trying to find the food.

2377
02:45:48,260 --> 02:45:48,960
That's it.

2378
02:45:49,060 --> 02:45:51,260
I literally restarted the server.

02:45:52,120 --> 02:45:53,980
You were like the server owner?

I think I'm in a different server.

2383
02:46:01,420 --> 02:46:01,720

I thought that was just all about, like, teamwork.

2390
02:46:23,700 --> 02:46:28,760
It was literally finding all the food and then that's it.

2391
02:46:28,940 --> 02:46:29,900
And then you could end the game.

2392
02:46:30,540 --> 02:46:39,100
I found four and then the game was like good enough It was
like you found four good for you I found one that's like

Be careful out there.

2606
03:00:58,810 --> 03:01:00,750
And whatever you do, don't go into the basement.

2607
03:01:01,210 --> 03:01:03,110
The keys are in the room across this one.

2608
03:01:03,170 --> 03:01:04,190
Please just throw it out.

2609
03:01:04,290 --> 03:01:05,450
I couldn't do it myself.

2610
03:01:05,850 --> 03:01:06,950
The key wasn't normal.

2611
03:01:07,110 --> 03:01:07,630
It's cursed.

2612
03:01:07,750 --> 03:01:11,150
If you choose to go in there, no promises, you'll be making
it back.

2613
03:01:11,310 --> 03:01:12,130
All right, let's go in there.

2614
03:01:12,690 --> 03:01:13,990
I picked up a couple keys.

2615
03:01:14,150 --> 03:01:16,490
They gotta be a little bit more like descriptive.

2616
03:01:17,530 --> 03:01:18,770
I picked up key number two.

2617
03:01:18,790 --> 03:01:21,310
Oh, how the fuck did we get here?

2618
03:01:22,930 --> 03:01:23,330
Whoa.

2619
03:01:24,010 --> 03:01:25,730
Okay, I can really use those glasses.

2620
03:01:26,130 --> 03:01:27,810
I need these glasses, man.

2621
03:01:29,850 --> 03:01:33,270
Why is there a fucking pool with trees under here?

2622
03:01:35,530 --> 03:01:36,010
Oh, yeah.

2623
03:01:36,190 --> 03:01:40,250
I feel like I feel like I'm gonna get... Wait, what the fuck
is that?

2624
03:01:40,690 --> 03:01:41,690
Oh, God, I got goosebumps.

2625
03:01:42,010 --> 03:01:42,630
What the fuck is that?

2626
03:01:42,670 --> 03:01:43,350
Do you see that?

2627
03:01:44,810 --> 03:01:46,450
I... Do you see that?

2628
03:01:47,510 --> 03:01:49,470
I... It's a... It's the woman!

2629
03:01:49,970 --> 03:01:50,630
Is that the woman?

2630
03:01:51,490 --> 03:01:52,170
It's the woman.

2631
03:01:52,530 --> 03:01:53,670
What are you doing here?

2632
03:01:53,690 --> 03:01:54,670
It's not real, isn't it?

2633
03:01:55,170 --> 03:01:56,110
Especially not in the game.

2634
03:01:56,390 --> 03:01:56,610
Women are real?

2635
03:01:58,970 --> 03:02:00,390
What are you doing here?

2636
03:02:00,990 --> 03:02:01,430
Nonprotection.

2637
03:02:07,530 --> 03:02:08,410
What happened?

2638
03:02:11,590 --> 03:02:12,470
What happened?

2639
03:02:12,470 --> 03:02:13,190
Are you okay?

2640
03:02:14,050 --> 03:02:16,070
I don't think she liked that, dude.

2641
03:02:16,190 --> 03:02:18,330
I called her out on her fucking gamer blog.

2642

2645
03:02:56,880 --> 03:02:59,040
There's two bookstores next to each other.

2646
03:02:59,240 --> 03:02:59,780
My mom was okay with this, dude.

2647
03:02:59,840 --> 03:03:00,520

2648
03:03:00,520 --> 03:03:01,640

2649
03:03:01,640 --> 03:03:04,540
Oh my god, did you sign, like, the permission form from your
mom?

2650
03:03:05,460 --> 03:03:05,700

2651
03:03:05,700 --> 03:03:06,500
I forged it.

2652
03:03:06,700 --> 03:03:07,240
I forged it.

2653
03:03:07,400 --> 03:03:08,740
You forged your signature?

2654
03:03:09,480 --> 03:03:09,920

2655
03:03:11,700 --> 03:03:12,520
That's not cool.

2656
03:03:12,680 --> 03:03:14,340
There's three bookstores back to back.

2657
03:03:14,440 --> 03:03:17,080
This is not a very, like, smart business decision.

2658
03:03:17,280 --> 03:03:18,940
It is a school trip.

2659
03:03:19,000 --> 03:03:20,800
Maybe you were in, like, a library section.

2660
03:03:21,340 --> 03:03:22,180

I don't like this, Snuffy.

2669
03:04:33,040 --> 03:04:34,780
I don't feel so good.

2670
03:04:35,280 --> 03:04:37,440
I don't... I think she's around the corner.

2671
03:04:37,680 --> 03:04:39,240
I don't feel so good.

2672
03:04:41,720 --> 03:04:43,080
What's a big maze?

2673
03:04:43,360 --> 03:04:44,080
What the...

2674
03:04:44,080 --> 03:04:47,200
Snuffy, maybe Roblox games can be scary.

2675
03:04:47,900 --> 03:04:50,040
Oh yeah, yeah, you're feeling the stress?

2676
03:04:50,240 --> 03:04:50,560

03:05:33,280 --> 03:05:33,620
Let's see.

2687
03:05:34,300 --> 03:05:35,200
I don't think that was right.

2688
03:05:35,400 --> 03:05:36,080
I think that was a dead end.

2689
03:05:36,300 --> 03:05:37,300
I think so, too.

2690
03:05:37,620 --> 03:05:37,920
All right.

2691
03:05:38,760 --> 03:05:41,080
We can do this together as a team.

2692
03:05:41,840 --> 03:05:42,300
Here, here, here, here, here.

2693

There's, like, stuff here.

2697
03:05:46,560 --> 03:05:47,240
It's a dead man.

2698
03:05:47,340 --> 03:05:47,720
There's a key.

2699
03:05:47,840 --> 03:05:48,700

She chased me.

2729
03:08:12,820 --> 03:08:13,780
That was fucking scary.

2730
03:08:14,000 --> 03:08:16,100
She literally, the funniest thing is, like, she doesn't do
anything.

2731
03:08:16,220 --> 03:08:17,620
She just, like, stands, like, standing.

2732
03:08:17,620 --> 03:08:18,760
You have, like, your Discord.

2733
03:08:18,980 --> 03:08:22,600
You have, like, a Discord, like, a stabilizer thing or
something.

2734
03:08:22,900 --> 03:08:26,840
So when you start screaming, it was just static because it
was so loud.

2735
03:08:27,680 --> 03:08:29,980
Let me check my Discord settings.

2736
03:08:30,280 --> 03:08:30,900

It's over.

2929
03:20:07,440 --> 03:20:08,700
It's so over.

2930
03:20:11,180 --> 03:20:12,840
It's so over.

2931
03:20:13,040 --> 03:20:16,460
I literally hear you running from her.

2932
03:20:19,220 --> 03:20:20,580
It's so over.

2933
03:20:20,800 --> 03:20:21,620
I'm so lost.

2934
03:20:22,400 --> 03:20:23,880
I'm so lost, guys.

2935
03:20:25,040 --> 03:20:25,480
Whoa!

2936
03:20:25,760 --> 03:20:26,720
Wait, you did it!

2937
03:20:26,860 --> 03:20:32,780
Oh my god, we did it!

2938
03:20:32,940 --> 03:20:35,280
I knew splitting up was the right idea.

2939
03:20:35,440 --> 03:20:37,000
Yeah, I'm so...

2940
03:20:37,000 --> 03:20:38,460
We distracted them.

2941
03:20:38,740 --> 03:20:39,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2942
03:20:39,900 --> 03:20:41,000
We're in my now.

2943
03:20:41,300 --> 03:20:41,800
Divide and conquer.

2944
03:20:42,000 --> 03:20:42,760
Divide and conquer.

2945
03:20:42,960 --> 03:20:47,700
Just like my favorite war politician said.

2946
03:20:48,900 --> 03:20:49,040
Whoa.

2947
03:20:50,000 --> 03:20:50,900
End of chapter one.

03:20:51,000 --> 03:20:51,580
We did it.

2949
03:20:52,060 --> 03:20:53,680
I think this is...

2950
03:20:53,680 --> 03:20:55,860
I think it's a good time to call it because I...

2951
03:20:55,860 --> 03:20:56,340
Yeah, yeah.

2952
03:20:56,480 --> 03:20:57,220

2958
03:21:08,000 --> 03:21:09,720

Yeah, get me out of here.

2960
03:21:12,940 --> 03:21:14,260
Roblox core games, man.
