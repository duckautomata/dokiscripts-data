1
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:46,170
Hello everybody!

2
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:47,510
Hello, hello!

3
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:51,410
Sorry, uh, for being a little bit late, but it's okay.

4
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:52,950
I'm not the- whoa.

5
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:54,830
What the fuck?

6
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:56,330
What the fuck?

7
00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:59,810
There's an in- There's in-game music?

8
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:01,250
Oh, that was the game.

9
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:03,110
Okay, that like freaked me out.

10
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:04,810
I was like, what the fuck is that?

11
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:06,550
That- that's the in-game music.

12
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:06,930
Okay.

13
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:08,930
Oh my god, that- that actually freaked me out.

14
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:14,650
Uh- Anyway, I know I'm not late because there's one, two, three, four people missing.

15
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:16,780
And one of them is on my team, so...

16
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:24,870
So, um, I know I'm not late, so- Oh, there's a practice arena?

17
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:28,750
What the fuck do you mean there's a practice-

18
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:33,210
Okay.

19
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:36,890
All right, that's cool.

20
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:45,250
Oh, that's- I- If I knew there was a practice arena, I would have practiced!

21
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:50,410
Okay, anyway.

22
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:53,810
Because there wasn't in the last block wars.

23
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:58,190
There was no practice arena in the last block wars.

24
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:04,570
So how the fuck was I supposed to know there was one in this one?

25
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:08,270
Because I'm just saying, guys.

26
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:13,510
I remembered I was like asked like during the very first block wars.

27
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:17,650
I was like, hey, how do I practice for block wars?

28
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:19,610
And they're like, oh, there's no practice arena.

29
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:25,610
And then I was like, okay, and now you're telling me there was a practice arena?

30
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:31,730
Okay, that's cool.

31
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:37,130
I'm not mad, I'm just disappointed.

32
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:45,690
I didn't ask for this one because I assumed- I assumed they were all the same!

33
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:52,770
It's a deep end.

34
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:55,850
Thank you for the magenta soup, but thank you, thank you.

35
00:03:56,390 --> 00:04:01,150
Um, if I have to choose between watching doki or breki for- You chose correctly.

36
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:02,390
The deep end.

37
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:05,110
Thank you for the magenta soup, but thank you, thank you.

38
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:06,190
I don't know.

39
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:08,910
I just assumed that they're all the same.

40
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:13,270
How was I supposed to know that this time it'd be different?

41
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:18,830
Like, what do you mean there's a hub navigation now?

42
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:22,410
Anyway, um, I'm not lazy.

43
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:26,090
We're missing literally like number seven is missing two players.

44
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:34,450
I'm not late, I'm actually not late.

45
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:42,170
They're not even- I can see who's logged in!

46
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,030
Okay, yeah, there is.

47
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:53,510
I'm pretty sure music and sound turn this off whether- That's not it.

48
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:57,550
I did it.

49
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:00,330
Oh, okay.

50
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:02,930
This has to be the music.

51
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:06,330
Oh, sorry, was that really loud?

52
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:12,830
Did you all- Did you all fucking- Were you all like trying- trying so hard to figure out what the fuck I was saying?

53
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:13,350
I'm sorry.

54
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:17,210
I didn't realize how loud it was.

55
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:20,410
Um, but I'll join the VC later.

56
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:21,350
I just want to talk.

57
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:24,050
Um, but, uh, yeah.

58
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:27,430
Anyway, um, silence.

59
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:32,050
Anyway, uh, what was I gonna say?

60
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:37,290
Uh, yeah, dad is officially, uh, um, at the sitter.

61
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:46,450
Doki Amber Doge is officially at the sitter because, you know, I have to go away, uh, out of Canada to practice for the concert.

62
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:51,130
Um, so what the fuck is that?

63
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:53,290
Okay, what?

64
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:56,870
Oh, sorry, I had to like comprehend what that skin was for a second.

65
00:05:57,070 --> 00:06:03,990
I- Anyway, so I like how this is like an entirely new map for this one.

66
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:06,910
I wonder if it's like- Oh, I guess because this is not Halloween.

67
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:10,070
It's like the- I wonder if that's like the normal block wars map.

68
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:14,550
Anyway, uh, so, um, it was very expensive.

69
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:17,290
I forgot how expensive.

70
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:22,750
Because like usually I would put the dog- put him at a dog sitter for like, you know, two to three days.

71
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:28,970
But this time I'll be gone for a little while, uh, like till like almost like the end of the week.

72
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:33,650
So I was like- Okay, so I was- when I saw the bill I was like-

73
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:48,050
Anyway, um, today's gonna be a, uh, really packed day because today, uh, today I have- Oh my gosh, I'm gonna be late for my dance lessons.

74
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:48,710
That's for sure.

75
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:52,150
Uh, today is, uh, this.

76
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:55,670
This block war stream which could last two to three hours.

77
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:59,410
I don't know if I'll be watching till the very end of the fucking block wars.

78
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:00,770
Like if we don't make it to the finals.

79
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:01,890
I don't know.

80
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:02,530
We'll see.

81
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:03,630
We'll see how I feel.

82
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:10,410
Well, because, um, because like I have dance lessons right after.

83
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:13,990
So, uh, I don't think we're gonna make it to the finals.

84
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:14,730
You wanna know why?

85
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:19,010
Because remember that guy, that Feinberg guy that literally single-handedly carried this entire team?

86
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:20,790
Yeah, he's- he's in here.

87
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:25,390
Um, I was told this was a rookies- I guess like rookies division.

88
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:32,390
So, uh, you know the guy that basically had like 80% of the points for our- for our team?

89
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:33,690
He's on an enemy team.

90
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:38,090
So, and then we have the project leader who was lagging last time.

91
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:41,490
I mean, he was a- he was a good player.

92
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:47,710
But we can't deny the fact that he was lagging at the last tournament.

93
00:07:53,470 --> 00:08:00,090
And, um, um, anyway, so he's- I think each team has like one Minecraft pro.

94
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:06,610
And then, um, uh, and then, you know, they- they basically- each team has one Minecraft pro.

95
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:14,510
And then they, um, uh, and then they all like divide it up onto each team and stuff.

96
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:16,150
So, like, I don't know.

97
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:22,790
I feel like if Feinberg is gonna be in this tournament, like, they should just remove a player.

98
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:25,510
I mean, technically he doesn't have the last player.

99
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:32,450
But like, in my opinion, I think if you remove a player on his team, it'd still be very fair.

100
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:41,710
It's so- it's so- after what I saw he did last tournament, I feel like it'd be so fair.

101
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:47,250
That's a compliment.

102
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:49,710
I'm saying he's literally really good.

103
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:56,290
Because the last tournament, he basically got us 80% of our points to help us win.

104
00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:58,410
But of course, I clutched the finals though.

105
00:08:58,490 --> 00:08:59,550
Don't forget that.

106
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:04,190
I- I clutched the finals though.

107
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:06,130
I- I did that.

108
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:12,410
No, it's just a for fun thing.

109
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:15,790
Um, so yeah, I'm- I'm Luigi.

110
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:17,790
We're all Luigi because we're green.

111
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:21,890
Uh, but we're just- we're just waiting on people.

112
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:24,110
I'll join the VC later.

113
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:27,030
I just wanted to chill and hang out with you guys before.

114
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:28,390
Also, like, I'm tired.

115
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:35,750
So like, I need to like, you know, like a slow engine rev to be like, um, to be like social.

116
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:41,130
To be like an actual- to protect- to fake it.

117
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:43,150
Fake being an extrovert- extrovert.

118
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:44,290
Because it's really crazy.

119
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:49,330
A lot of people think I'm an extrovert, but I'm like so fucking, um, introvert.

120
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:50,850
No, I'm very tired right now.

121
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:52,730
I'm waiting for the gamer subs to kick in.

122
00:09:52,730 --> 00:10:01,650
Um, so I'm like revving up, uh, to like pretend to be an extrovert because I'm actually an introvert.

123
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:06,710
And like, uh, social interaction is very scary.

124
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:17,570
Um, and today I'm like extra tired, uh, because yesterday was a very long day.

125
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:20,070
The day before that was a very long day.

126
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:24,450
And the day before that was also a very long day.

127
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:40,330
So today is- today is going to be a very long day because today I have this, then dance classes, then member stream, then- then the- then Kamifuro convention with a panel and a meet and greet.

128
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:45,290
So- and then- and then the day after that, I have a three hour dance lesson.

129
00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:49,470
I think it's like three or four hour dance lessons the day after that.

130
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:54,150
And I might do a gorilla rush stream because I feel bad because I have a drop.

131
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:57,490
And then like, obviously, it's very hard to do.

132
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:00,790
Um, so I keep pressing R.

133
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:02,310
I keep pressing R.

134
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:14,250
And then so like, uh, and I have to- and I have to make sure I stream enough of the rush drops before I, uh, before I go leave Canada.

135
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:20,770
But- and then- and then I'll be in America.

136
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:24,350
And then I'll be in America practicing for the concert.

137
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:28,110
And I'll be back at the end of the- at the end of next week.

138
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:36,530
I have slept just not as much as I would like because, um, okay, is everybody- no, and not everybody's still not here.

139
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:40,310
All right, we're still missing two more- wait, I'm looking at the VC.

140
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:44,170
Yeah, we're still missing, uh, two more.

141
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:58,570
And I'm okay to be- it's okay this week for me to be really busy because- Also, I'm definitely gonna be late for dance classes because like, I went in assuming that like, we're starting at, uh, 11 a.m.

142
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:01,170
Silly me, we don't- of course we don't start at 11 a.m.

143
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:03,170
There's like, so many VTubers.

144
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:13,810
It's like- it's like the VTuber curse you never- It's like the- sorry, VTuber curse you never start on time.

145
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:16,690
So like, ah, silly me for thinking we're gonna start on time.

146
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:22,870
If we add up all the VTubers together, we're definitely not starting on time.

147
00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:28,290
Anyway.

148
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:37,430
I keep pressing R accidentally because I- I'm like, reloading.

149
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:42,070
You know, I just wanna be like, real- reloading.

150
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:46,330
What was I gonna say?

151
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:49,330
Okay, I'm gonna be playing this without the shaders.

152
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:49,830
Why?

153
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:53,990
Because I have a feeling- Actually, no, I should like the shaders.

154
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:55,770
No, I'm gonna do it.

155
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:58,130
Fuck it, I'm gonna play with the shaders because it looks prettier.

156
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:02,390
But if I played it without my shaders, this is what it's gonna look like.

157
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:04,990
I don't know if you guys remember what Minecraft looks like without shaders.

158
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:14,870
Oh my god, it's so fucking ugly.

159
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:26,190
No, I decided that like, fuck optimal- optimizing.

160
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:32,810
If we like, get to the finals, it will be a very pleasant surprise.

161
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:40,750
It'll be an incredibly pleasant surprise.

162
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:47,510
Oh my god,

163
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:53,790
I'm reloading again!

164
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:54,750
Fuck, okay, I'm sorry.

165
00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:58,290
I'm sorry, I keep- I don't know why, I keep wanna reload.

166
00:13:58,650 --> 00:14:01,450
I keep- I need to like, unbind.

167
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:02,830
I'm gonna unbind the R.

168
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:04,610
I keep wanting to be like, reload.

169
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:08,710
Uh, keep binds where the fuck is R.

170
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:11,410
Um, all right, uh...

171
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:14,410
No.

172
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,900
No, um, how do I delete it?

173
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:24,200
How do I delete it?

174
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,340
Wait, how do I delete this?

175
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:27,420
Is it escape?

176
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,340
All right, good, okay.

177
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:34,620
All right, that should be good.

178
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,320
Okay, nice, all right.

179
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,140
Okay, are we all here?

180
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:41,300
No.

181
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:45,260
No, we're missing one person on our team.

182
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:49,140
No more reloading.

183
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:55,620
Okay, okay, let's see, I'm- Oh wait, no, everybody is technically in the VC.

184
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:59,720
All right, guys, we're gonna pretend we're- we're a real person today.

185
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:04,960
We're gonna pretend we're- we're real.

186
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:08,740
We can- we can function in society.

187
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:11,900
All right, it's skinwalking time.

188
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:19,880
All right, okay, it's also like more unnerving because there's people I actually don't know.

189
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:22,620
Like a lot of people I don't know this time around.

190
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:25,160
So like, like Gumi's not here too.

191
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:33,780
So it's like, um, it's more unnerving because you can be like, Oh, but Hakko was in your Wrestle- Yeah, but we never really interacted outside of that.

192
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:36,800
So it's more like everybody is like super new.

193
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,580
Like, I just don't know anybody.

194
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:42,020
And you're like, oh, but you had that Wolfiez guy.

195
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:45,360
Yeah, that was the last- that was the only time we've interacted.

196
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:50,340
The only time we've interacted.

197
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:54,160
So it's like this entire team is just new.

198
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:57,140
And I'm like, oh, new!

199
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:03,980
My entire team is all new people.

200
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:09,560
And oh, and anxiety goes up.

201
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:16,460
All right, oh, everybody's here except for- Oh my god, remember when I said they should just remove a player on his team?

202
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:19,280
I didn't actually mean that, but like, it's a nice surprise.

203
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:24,140
Just for the fact that like, he's just not there.

204
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:27,460
Like, it's just a pleasant surprise.

205
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:31,100
Oh, no, no, he's in the VC.

206
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:33,360
He's in the VC, so he's gonna come in.

207
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:35,380
All right, guys, I'm gonna pretend I'm a person now.

208
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:38,620
Hello?

209
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,160
True, true, true.

210
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:40,640
It's okay.

211
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:44,940
I am also- I am fortunately, unfortunately a fanboy too.

212
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:46,100
So it could be like that.

213
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,020
That's the life I chose.

214
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,460
Wait, is everybody a fanboy here?

215
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:48,880
What?

216
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,740
Yeah, especially Donkey, dude.

217
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:52,720
What did I do?

218
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:52,740
What?

219
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:53,680
What was my favorite fanboy?

220
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,200
I was like, hyping myself.

221
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:57,420
I was like, it's time to be social right now.

222
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:00,280
And then the first thing I heard is everybody's a fanboy.

223
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:02,520
What the fuck happened in this Discord?

224
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,800
We're just bonding, bro.

225
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,380
You fucking missed out.

226
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,680
Oh my god, thank god I missed out.

227
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:11,780
Thank god.

228
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,020
You should leave.

229
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:14,940
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

230
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:17,100
I'm about to open a window of HuniePop right now on YouTube.

231
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:18,600
But we're gonna like, simulplay it, bro.

232
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:19,340
It's gonna be crazy.

233
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:21,820
I'm so lost.

234
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:22,780
I'm gonna be so for real.

235
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,400
It's okay, dude.

236
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,460
Don't worry about it.

237
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,040
Oh god.

238
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,300
Yeah, whatever.

239
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,340
Yeah, no, that's... yep.

240
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:32,080
Yep.

241
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:33,560
I forgot.

242
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,360
That's what you get for fucking inviting YouTubers to your event, bro.

243
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:37,740
It's on you.

244
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,300
Benzoin, I have a question.

245
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,260
Call me Haka, don't call me Banzai.

246
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:41,940
I can't.

247
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:43,620
I need advice.

248
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:45,180
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

249
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:46,640
I've already disassociated.

250
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:49,840
Maybe.

251
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:54,300
I've already like, disassociated from this conversation.

252
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:57,040
I used to when I was a very angsty teenager.

253
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:58,120
But not anymore, though.

254
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,240
Because I kind of got too tired of like, having shit in my mouth, if that makes sense.

255
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,860
What the fuck am I hearing?

256
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:03,860
What's a snake bite?

257
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,280
It's like the... it's the piercings.

258
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,320
Like, little two dots in your... yeah, yeah, yeah.

259
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:10,460
I need to fix this.

260
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:12,420
I had them when I was a really angsty teenager.

261
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,040
But then I just became Adam Sandler.

262
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:17,020
My mouth...

263
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:18,480
What the hell is that?

264
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,380
Oh my god.

265
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:22,300
You're so done already.

266
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:22,960
What, you good?

267
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:24,520
Okay, I'm fixing my Discord over there.

268
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,820
Bro, it's just snake bites.

269
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,040
What does that tell you?

270
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:28,200
Like, where else would it be?

271
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,060
Yeah, I said it, Demi.

272
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:29,960
More like, dummy.

273
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:31,300
Shut the fuck up, man.

274
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,540
Shut the fuck up, shut the fuck up.

275
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,640
You fuck this guy.

276
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:36,280
Fuck this guy.

277
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,260
Yeah, fuck that guy, bro.

278
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:39,260
All right, hold on.

279
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:40,920
We gotta... we gotta wait for Spleef, all right?

280
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:41,700
Get his ass.

281
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:45,100
We have multiple oppositions in this event.

282
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:46,080
Number one, Booster.

283
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:46,520
Oh god.

284
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:47,920
Oh, Demi's gone.

285
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,540
Dude, now you see the names.

286
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:49,940
Now you see the names.

287
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:51,060
I have my number one op here.

288
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:52,020
Fucking Giga, dude.

289
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,320
It's so over the moment.

290
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,400
Giga gets my ass.

291
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:55,700
I don't know what to do, man.

292
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:56,500
The Discord is loud?

293
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,660
Okay, I'll turn it down.

294
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:58,300
Give me my number one op, Haka.

295
00:18:59,020 --> 00:18:59,900
Oh my god.

296
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,900
Maybe I need more gamersubs.

297
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,940
My energy is not to this point yet.

298
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,640
I'm a freak, man.

299
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:11,940
You can't do that shit to me, bro.

300
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,580
My energy is not to that...

301
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:15,000
I'm fucking pretty pushed to talk.

302
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,660
My energy is not at that level.

303
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,540
You've been locked into this, dude.

304
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,640
We have a conflict of interest on this, you all right?

305
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,760
Because Giga was our teammates for me and Doki last time and we won.

306
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:32,040
Pushed to talk needs permission?

307
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:33,700
Yeah, we won.

308
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:34,960
It's okay, though.

309
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:35,460
It's okay.

310
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:36,220
Okay, guys.

311
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,300
Pushed to talk needs fucking permission.

312
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:39,240
We got fucking, like, luck-worst winner here.

313
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:40,080
Like, lying, bro.

314
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:40,980
We're so fucking ready.

315
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:41,760
Like, yeah.

316
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:43,720
We're fucking worrying about it.

317
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:44,680
You need permission?

318
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,220
Did you push to talk in this server?

319
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:50,540
We're so fucking ready, bro.

320
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:51,940
Okay.

321
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,080
And they got me the special fucking hire?

322
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,180
Like, that's fucking crazy, dude.

323
00:19:56,580 --> 00:20:01,960
It's like fucking, like, you know, Cristiano Ronaldo just fucking, like, they just got, like, fucking messy up, like, Minecraft here.

324
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:02,960
That's just...

325
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:03,140
Okay.

326
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:04,560
Where's the mute?

327
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,840
I need to mute myself.

328
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:07,760
Toggle mute.

329
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:08,200
Okay.

330
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:08,860
Don't worry.

331
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:09,980
Should I speak more Spanish?

332
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:11,460
Control shift M...

333
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:12,000
How do I...

334
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,320
I don't know why you're buying this.

335
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,000
I do not know your Spanish.

336
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,640
Save a bind.

337
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:18,080
Keep it...

338
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:18,720
I don't know how to say this.

339
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,620
Add a key bind.

340
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,140
It's okay.

341
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:21,940
Action.

342
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:22,700
Don't worry, boss.

343
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:24,260
Toggle mute.

344
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:25,040
I don't think...

345
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:25,320
Okay.

346
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,160
Son of a bitch.

347
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:28,280
Record.

348
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:30,180
Okay, there we go.

349
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,020
Yeah, I like this guy.

350
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:32,260
I think they're like a very...

351
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:32,880
I did it.

352
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:33,900
I fucking...

353
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:34,860
Yeah, we're so fucking ready, bro.

354
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:35,520
I did it.

355
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:36,960
I figured it out.

356
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:39,060
I'm gonna mess up.

357
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,060
I'm gonna...

358
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:42,200
I'm gonna mess up the toggle mute.

359
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:42,840
I know.

360
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:46,640
I think that was pretty good.

361
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,360
Okay, bring down a Haka.

362
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:50,400
Okay.

363
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,120
I brought...

364
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,140
You'll be mesmerized by my gamer skills.

365
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:56,440
I brought him down and then I'll raise up.

366
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:57,820
All right.

367
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:01,000
I mean, there's even Shadow the Hedgehog.

368
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,020
We're so fucking ready.

369
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:03,420
What the fuck?

370
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,780
Nah, he sucks ass.

371
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:05,740
We'll be in.

372
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:06,180
Okay.

373
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:06,480
It's easy.

374
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:07,340
Everything sucks ass.

375
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:08,320
Okay, I get it.

376
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:10,280
Okay, I was gonna be like, what the fuck?

377
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,680
That's not what he looks like.

378
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:12,720
You play CS, right?

379
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:14,300
They're still quite...

380
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:15,560
That's like condescending nowadays.

381
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:19,060
Wait, oh no, do not...

382
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:20,860
Wait.

383
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:21,580
Nah, you're right.

384
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:22,360
Thank you.

385
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:22,540
No.

386
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:27,220
No, I hope I don't make it to the finals.

387
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,420
I can't do this again.

388
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:31,620
They're like, oh, you guys play CS?

389
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,320
And I'm like, wait a minute.

390
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,320
Wow, you're the one good.

391
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:36,500
Oh, I can't.

392
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,380
I can't do this again.

393
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,200
I can't do this.

394
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:41,840
I can't do this.

395
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,520
This is basically what we played.

396
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:45,080
I'm like, so not good.

397
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:45,880
I can't, I don't...

398
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:46,700
Not again.

399
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:47,720
Not again.

400
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:50,340
I might have like a plaid leg or like...

401
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,000
Wait, it's really the same.

402
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,460
It's the same games.

403
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:55,860
Wait.

404
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:01,460
I won't fuck up this one this time, guys.

405
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:04,020
Yeah, I think I would rather keep my sanity.

406
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:08,040
I'm gonna stick to more, you know, like competitive games like fucking Minecraft.

407
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:11,860
Yeah, I won't fuck it up this time.

408
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:14,000
Yeah, become a Minecraft streamer like Wolfy, bro.

409
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:14,660
It's gonna be crazy.

410
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,360
I thought it'd be different.

411
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,340
Kumi told me it was different last time when she played.

412
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:21,720
This was...

413
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:22,500
This was a different last time.

414
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,180
See, that's how much I haven't done shit.

415
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,000
CSGO is just a better name.

416
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:30,740
She told me the last time she was in Blog Wars, it was different.

417
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:31,780
Yeah, it was cool.

418
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,580
Fuck me for saying every game is gonna be different.

419
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:37,460
It's literally the same.

420
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:41,340
Do I get to catch out of the skin and keep the money?

421
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:44,900
Because it's the same game, I should have experience, right?

422
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,660
I should be able to do this.

423
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:48,860
I already got a crippling addiction.

424
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:51,100
It's called fucking Pokemon TCG pocket, man.

425
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:52,520
It's fucking crazy.

426
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:55,840
I am actively resisting the urge to play that game.

427
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,900
No, you should play it, dude.

428
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:58,800
No, no.

429
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,060
No, no.

430
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:00,400
No, no.

431
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:01,100
Okay.

432
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,600
It got so good to your soul.

433
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:04,240
I was up at 3 fucking a.m.

434
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,520
pulling like a motherfucker.

435
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,560
Literally doing all the missions and shit.

436
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:12,400
I got 120 hourglasses and I did my first 10x pack opening.

437
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:13,880
It was crazy, bro.

438
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:16,620
I'm telling you, the pulls I'm getting are fucking insane.

439
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,540
I can't wait for this shit to actually get monetized.

440
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:19,640
I can sell that shit online.

441
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:21,160
I'd go crazy.

442
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:24,460
You know, like, how I feel in this...

443
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:25,740
It's crazy, man.

444
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:26,280
It's so good.

445
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:29,040
You know how I feel in this desperate at the moment?

446
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,980
Yeah, you gotta look at it that way.

447
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:35,200
Okay, the big dogs are like tired of life at that point.

448
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,740
Because they're like everything...

449
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:39,480
They're just like life.

450
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:41,060
It's really fun, though.

451
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:41,840
It's really, really fun.

452
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:47,400
Like genuinely, I've never been familiar with trading card games like rules and shit.

453
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:49,020
I just collected them for the art.

454
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:51,820
But now I know how the game actually fucking works.

455
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:54,120
And that is like actually really fucking cool.

456
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:57,520
Because I never thought I was like going to like familiarize myself with the rules and shit.

457
00:23:58,060 --> 00:23:58,820
That's pretty cool.

458
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:00,860
No, we're gonna socialize.

459
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:01,500
I'm just...

460
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:02,160
I need to...

461
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,200
100 % card games.

462
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,460
I just need to like get revved up at the moment.

463
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:07,460
Hey, me either, though.

464
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:08,820
But this shit literally gets you in.

465
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:09,620
It's good.

466
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:10,840
Like I'm not even kidding you.

467
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:11,680
I need a guide.

468
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:15,940
Never in my fucking life I thought I was going to be like studying meta fucking like decks for like Pokemon.

469
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:16,460
There you go.

470
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,680
I put them back all the way to 100.

471
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:19,340
I'm telling you, like it's crazy.

472
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:20,420
Sorry, guys.

473
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:21,100
I still...

474
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:21,940
Oh my god.

475
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:22,440
Oh my god.

476
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:22,900
We're all here.

477
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:24,140
We're actually all here.

478
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:26,860
I knew...

479
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:28,200
I knew I wouldn't be the last.

480
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:28,960
I was like...

481
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:32,180
Oh, I'm gonna be like, you know, five minutes late to the server.

482
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:34,020
But then I'm like, no, that's early.

483
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:35,860
Yes, FW is even earlier.

484
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:36,860
Oh, yeah.

485
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:39,160
That's early, technically.

486
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:40,800
Oh my god.

487
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:41,080
Yes!

488
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:43,000
Oh my god.

489
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,100
I was like, I'm gonna go.

490
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,680
Oh my god.

491
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:46,480
Oh my god.

492
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:48,100
We're actually starting.

493
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:49,220
Thank god.

494
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:50,200
We're starting.

495
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:50,560
No!

496
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:52,300
Oh my god.

497
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:53,520
I was practicing in my literature.

498
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,340
Only half an hour late.

499
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:57,400
Hey, at least you didn't blame the event.

500
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:57,980
Right, guys?

501
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:58,720
It's totally...

502
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,840
Aren't you the project leader?

503
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,840
I'm gonna fucking write a complaint right now.

504
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:02,980
I'm just saying, man.

505
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,540
You're literally the project leader.

506
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:09,020
People went, oh, actually, I can't play five minutes.

507
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:10,280
You should be like...

508
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:12,040
If you're late, you get a warning.

509
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:15,520
And if you get three warnings, you're kicked out of FW never again.

510
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:17,000
I've been sitting...

511
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,460
Hey, not me, not me, not me anymore.

512
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:21,900
Heavenly father.

513
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:22,960
Let's go.

514
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:23,360
All right.

515
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,300
I've been sitting here for a fucking hour.

516
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:29,640
You guys literally came here like 10 minutes before the stream actually happened.

517
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:32,140
But you guys were too busy talking to your chat and shit.

518
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:35,300
Hey, Wolf, can you not make that rule?

519
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:38,540
Oh, so you don't like your chat because you don't want to talk to your chat.

520
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:39,680
That's fucked.

521
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:40,480
You don't like...

522
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,080
Oh, my God.

523
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:42,100
You don't like your chat.

524
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:43,140
You don't want to talk to them.

525
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:45,200
You're trying to find excuses to not talk to them.

526
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:45,800
I love these motherfuckers.

527
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:47,240
I would fucking die for them.

528
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:48,140
But what happens?

529
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:48,860
I'm not like...

530
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:49,660
Oh, but you're like...

531
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:52,700
Oh, but you're too busy talking to your chat.

532
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:55,060
Bro, I'm too busy being a fucking idol.

533
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:55,740
What do you mean?

534
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:04,080
Like, man, I cannot sit down and just fucking open TikTok like you motherfuckers.

535
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:05,800
Like, if I could do that, I could be like the whole fucking day.

536
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:05,980
What the fuck?

537
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,280
I'm streaming on YouTube too.

538
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:08,480
What the fuck are you talking about?

539
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,400
I follow the same rules as you.

540
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:11,380
What do you mean?

541
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:12,520
I went through the same thing.

542
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:14,600
What do you mean?

543
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:16,520
I gotta get open and all this shit on stream.

544
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:17,460
Why would you know that?

545
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:17,820
I'm on YouTube.

546
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:19,480
I can get demonetized too.

547
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:22,460
Just log in, bro.

548
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:23,100
Just log in.

549
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:26,700
I'm not even on Twitch.

550
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:28,060
What the fuck are you talking about?

551
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:28,760
Just log in.

552
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:29,920
Log in and you'll be fine.

553
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:33,480
That's like you, bro.

554
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,220
I'm just like, what the fuck is he talking about?

555
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,060
I can't just open TikTok.

556
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,060
What do you mean?

557
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:42,400
Bro, I'm so dizzy already.

558
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:43,120
What the fuck's happening?

559
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:43,880
Who's moving me?

560
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:44,660
Okay.

561
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:45,340
Camera on that.

562
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:46,200
Okay.

563
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:47,980
What the fuck?

564
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:50,200
What did he call you?

565
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,380
Oh, you opened TikTok.

566
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,120
What the fuck do you mean?

567
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:56,240
Who watched the video?

568
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:57,000
Okay.

569
00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:58,760
I voiced it.

570
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,660
Oh, for real?

571
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:01,460
Yeah.

572
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:03,120
Oh, you did.

573
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:03,780
All right.

574
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:04,520
Oh, it seems.

575
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:04,940
Okay.

576
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:08,080
I need to bring down Wolf and bring up.

577
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:08,440
Okay.

578
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:10,000
Bring down Wolf.

579
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:14,440
Can I be your official Spanish dub?

580
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:15,540
And then them.

581
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:16,300
Okay.

582
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,640
I brought them up.

583
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:18,980
They look crazy.

584
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:19,920
Oh, insane, bro.

585
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,000
I don't even have to look at this.

586
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:22,280
They're the same thing.

587
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,540
Wow, they're coming.

588
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:25,740
Boom.

589
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:28,060
Azaka's still alive.

590
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:29,660
Holy shit.

591
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:31,420
Okay.

592
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,140
I brought him to fucking a hundred.

593
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:37,800
He's going to be lower than a hundred if this keeps up.

594
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:38,660
Get away from here.

595
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:40,180
Oh, ew.

596
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:40,860
I have to die.

597
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:42,300
That's nasty.

598
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:43,720
All right.

599
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,120
I brought him down.

600
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:51,300
Azaka's literally so fucking low right now.

601
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:57,620
Someone in my chat just said, Lenchu, why are you hock toying?

602
00:27:57,820 --> 00:27:58,160
Okay, I'm back.

603
00:27:58,260 --> 00:27:58,840
Oh, God.

604
00:27:59,060 --> 00:27:59,280
No.

605
00:27:59,640 --> 00:27:59,860
No.

606
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:01,440
Oh, my God.

607
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:02,340
Mikey, you're banned.

608
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:02,740
I'm sorry.

609
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:05,160
Oh, what is the average age?

610
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:06,940
Game intro time.

611
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:09,520
Guys, this is going to be us in approximately three teams.

612
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:11,100
Oh, God.

613
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:12,060
How do you know this?

614
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:12,820
Are you counting?

615
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:14,560
Oh, it's an order.

616
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:16,200
Yeah, that's why.

617
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,180
He's literally the leader.

618
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:21,580
Sorry, guys.

619
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:22,160
My bad.

620
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:23,040
Can you tell us the secrets?

621
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:24,740
Like, what's the best thing?

622
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:25,840
Um...

623
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:28,120
Alt-F4 to win.

624
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:29,820
All right.

625
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:30,400
I'll do it.

626
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:31,360
I'm going to do it.

627
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:31,860
Yeah!

628
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:33,560
Oh, my God.

629
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:36,200
It's us.

630
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:37,260
Let's go.

631
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:39,100
Oh, ew.

632
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:39,420
Booster.

633
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:41,040
Oh.

634
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,720
Yeah, this one is more...

635
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:46,340
Target Booster.

636
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:49,800
This is like a...

637
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:50,980
Um...

638
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:53,180
This is like the rookie division.

639
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:54,280
But I call bullshit.

640
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:55,200
It's funny.

641
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,780
He's also going to have to deal with...

642
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:01,360
I think we should target him during the split.

643
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,440
All I'm saying is...

644
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:04,780
I won the last one.

645
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:06,800
So why am I in the rookie division?

646
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:09,220
But they asked me to play again.

647
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:10,900
And I was like, all right, sure.

648
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:13,380
Not knowing my schedule for this week.

649
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,120
And I felt bad.

650
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:16,780
I was like, I don't want to drop out.

651
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:19,300
Because I said yes like two weeks ago.

652
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:22,300
Before I knew what my schedule was going to be like.

653
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,500
For this week.

654
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:24,800
So I was just like...

655
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:27,140
Wait, when was the last...

656
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:29,160
Whenever the last...

657
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:31,160
Block Wars was...

658
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,800
Whenever the last Block Wars was...

659
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:35,640
Um...

660
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:38,500
It was literally right after the last Block Wars.

661
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:39,540
They asked me if I wanted to do it.

662
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:41,500
I gave them a day to think about it.

663
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:43,480
And I was just like, all right, cool, yeah, sure.

664
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:45,460
And then...

665
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:47,960
I found out what my schedule was going to be for this week.

666
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:48,880
And I was like, what?

667
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:55,860
I'm getting drowned out by everyone else.

668
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:59,520
Okay, sound guy, what do I need to do?

669
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:02,960
Next time, I'm winning, right?

670
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:03,600
I'm so fucking ready.

671
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:07,980
Wait, people are killing people?

672
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:09,160
Holy shit, you can kill people?

673
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:11,840
I can leash someone.

674
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:14,120
That's fucking right, get off.

675
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:15,440
Get off of here.

676
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:18,960
Holy shit, the music is so fucking loud.

677
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:19,480
Damn.

678
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:22,240
Dude, I don't hear music.

679
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:25,040
I literally play my own fucking BGM because I can't hear shit.

680
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:26,960
Oh, it's in the...

681
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:29,440
You have to turn it off, I think.

682
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:30,600
All right.

683
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:33,060
Okay, everyone is just naturally noisy.

684
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,740
Wait, where are we playing?

685
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:35,640
What is this?

686
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,020
Is the order up again?

687
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,860
I think I might actually...

688
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:41,400
What is this?

689
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,020
Oh, it's the dark and dark.

690
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:44,960
Wait, is this dark and darker?

691
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:47,720
No, this is order up.

692
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:49,680
Oh, order up, okay.

693
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:52,240
Yeah, yeah, okay.

694
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,920
So I'll just gather stuff again.

695
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:56,400
This is the one that requires...

696
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,100
Wait, no, what?

697
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,920
Is this dark and darker?

698
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:02,260
Yeah, it's like Tomb Titan.

699
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,420
I'm pretty sure that's not order up.

700
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:05,580
I didn't look at the screen.

701
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:06,500
What the fuck is dark and darker?

702
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:09,740
I want the cool BGM.

703
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:11,460
I want to hear the cool BGM.

704
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:17,640
In options, music and sounds, there should be sliders there called hot music and game music.

705
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:20,760
It's at 100, I don't hear shit.

706
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:23,700
Oh, I don't think he downloaded the resource pack when he logged in.

707
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:24,540
I did not!

708
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:31,620
I don't think he sees anything then.

709
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:34,160
Like, he can't see anything at all.

710
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:36,840
I didn't get pinged in the resource pack.

711
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:40,160
No, when you log in, it tells you to install it.

712
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:42,340
Maybe just re-log in, you know?

713
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:43,480
Really?

714
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:44,360
I didn't get anything.

715
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:46,880
We'll take care of it.

716
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:49,120
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

717
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:51,120
No, you will not see anything.

718
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,920
You're going to accidentally run into a fucking mob.

719
00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:00,580
Everything is super customized and everything.

720
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:02,240
Is Feinberg in this game?

721
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:02,940
Yes.

722
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:05,640
Stop the event for me.

723
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:07,400
I'm going to re-log in.

724
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:15,960
All I'm saying is that you should have just removed the player in Feinberg's team after what he did last Black Wars.

725
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:18,840
You should have just removed yourself.

726
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:21,000
Who's bad Feinberg?

727
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,000
Or just remove all the Minecraft players.

728
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:24,360
Like the actual Minecraft players.

729
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,520
Just went straight up all rookies.

730
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:28,620
No Minecraft pros at all.

731
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:29,380
None of them.

732
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,620
We all try to figure this out ourselves.

733
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:34,060
I think Feinberg is way too good.

734
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:41,760
Log off the server, then when you have the server, edit and then enable resource pack.

735
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:45,000
Wait, do they know?

736
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,700
Do they know to pause?

737
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:49,120
You guys are waiting for me?

738
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:49,780
Yes, yes.

739
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:52,000
Leave the server right now.

740
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:54,240
I have to fucking hide it.

741
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:59,360
I thought the server is whitelisted.

742
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,820
Did you edit it?

743
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,120
Yeah, it's downloading.

744
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,880
Sweet, what the fuck?

745
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:08,140
Yo, nice mustache.

746
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:09,040
Appreciate that dog.

747
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:14,180
I was going to give everybody this nose.

748
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:17,500
I did Demi's first and it looked really weird, so I was like, nevermind.

749
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:20,660
Oh, but you look so good!

750
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:22,360
Oh my god!

751
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:23,960
This would have been so good!

752
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,360
Now we just look like fucking cosplayers instead of actually Luigi.

753
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:33,040
We look like spirit Halloween costumes.

754
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:39,040
I do not want to pause the event to give you all a nose and a mustache.

755
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:41,020
Pause the event!

756
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:41,840
Pause it!

757
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:43,520
Let's go.

758
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:48,260
Okay, so what we did last time is we went in squads.

759
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:52,580
Wait, but like Feinberg was by himself though.

760
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:53,980
Yeah, yeah.

761
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:59,900
So yeah, what we do is if you have experience you can do like a little...

762
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:00,380
Are you lagging?

763
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,280
Not anymore?

764
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:04,180
Okay, that's good.

765
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:08,920
I live in the Philippines so like this fucking server is from the US, right?

766
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,780
Yeah, it might be a little bit.

767
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,040
Wait, is there friendly fire?

768
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:14,520
Like, can I actually kill someone?

769
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:18,080
No, no, no, you can just keep fucking swinging.

770
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:19,660
Just keep swinging.

771
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,240
Fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up!

772
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:25,660
I'm just grabbing stuff.

773
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,180
Wait, you're actually like...

774
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:32,520
Oh shit, you can actually like loot stuff.

775
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:34,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah, the whole point is dark and dark.

776
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:35,800
It's literally dark and dark.

777
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:36,840
Loot as much as you can.

778
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:38,960
Green candles is a puzzle.

779
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:40,600
I'm in a puzzle room right now.

780
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:42,800
Wait, do you actually want a quick explanation?

781
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:43,860
Haka.

782
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:45,620
Whoa, what the fuck?

783
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:46,700
Do you want a quick explanation?

784
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:50,720
Have you ever played dark and dark, Haka?

785
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:52,760
It's literally sad in Minecraft form.

786
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:59,120
Has Haka played dark and dark before?

787
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:00,440
Yes, I have!

788
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:03,180
Okay, so yeah, it's just that.

789
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:04,740
Okay, okay, okay.

790
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:06,500
Spiders, spiders, spiders.

791
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,840
Oh, you said explanation, not inflation.

792
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:10,500
Okay, my bad, my bad.

793
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:11,640
Bro, sorry!

794
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:15,160
I think if I press this button, we die.

795
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:16,840
Press the button.

796
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,160
No, you press it.

797
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:20,220
Okay, fine, I'll press it.

798
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:21,240
Oh, okay.

799
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:26,320
Because last time we pressed the button we both fell through a fucking hole!

800
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:27,620
We did, we actually did.

801
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:29,760
Wait, should we kill him?

802
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,320
Hey dad, don't die, don't die.

803
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,560
Eat food, drink.

804
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:35,260
Where's the...

805
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:37,020
Okay, I did a puzzle.

806
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:40,560
Okay, I'm lost.

807
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:41,500
I can't see my map.

808
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:42,820
Oh, is it my resource pack?

809
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:46,320
I'm turning off my shader pack.

810
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,520
Are you using your shaders?

811
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:49,500
Oh, okay.

812
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:50,880
You know what, fuck it.

813
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:54,140
Yeah, we're gonna figure it out.

814
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:55,040
You said poison!

815
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:57,640
Oh, there's coins here.

816
00:35:58,580 --> 00:35:59,620
Yeah, it's my shader pack.

817
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:00,700
How is this...

818
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:03,220
How is this darker than before?

819
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:06,200
This is actually darker.

820
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,620
Wait, guys, is that...

821
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:13,220
Do you have your brightness up or do you want to turn that up?

822
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,400
How do we turn it up?

823
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:20,440
I think if you put your torches in your op hand and you just carry the map it should be better.

824
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:23,760
I can't believe it, it's actually...

825
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:24,840
They made it darker!

826
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:28,400
I can't believe they made it actually darker and darker.

827
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:33,100
It was lighter before when I first played it.

828
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:35,560
It's very bright for me.

829
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:37,460
I can see.

830
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:39,440
We just said that.

831
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:43,320
I think the music is piling up for me.

832
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:45,560
I'm hearing two different songs going on.

833
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:46,460
No, I do too.

834
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:50,280
The hub music is going on on top of the darker and darker music.

835
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:55,080
There's a slider in the sound setting that says turn this off.

836
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:56,280
You should probably turn that off.

837
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:59,400
Oh, there we go.

838
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:00,460
Thank you.

839
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:02,720
We don't need hub music.

840
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,420
It says turn off.

841
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:08,640
I was like, what the fuck is this time signature?

842
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:10,640
Wait, is there fall damage?

843
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,800
We're gonna try to find out.

844
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:14,020
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

845
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:15,380
You're all together.

846
00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:16,560
I'm so far behind.

847
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:17,000
Hold on.

848
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:18,620
Let me get there real quick.

849
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:19,660
Fuck him up, fuck him up.

850
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:20,360
I'm okay.

851
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:22,400
Nice, nice, nice, nice.

852
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,460
Fuck yeah.

853
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:26,280
I have gold boost for you.

854
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:27,780
Like, are gold boosts stronger?

855
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:30,620
Yeah, than like leather?

856
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:31,620
Yeah, than leather.

857
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:33,780
How about chainmail?

858
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,840
Which is stronger, chainmail or the gold?

859
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:39,160
We got a professional Minecraft streamer here.

860
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:40,200
We forget that shit.

861
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:44,200
Do you guys actually change to the armor that you want?

862
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:44,840
I leave.

863
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:46,320
Goodbye, everybody.

864
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:47,940
I shall leave now.

865
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:49,780
Wait, the whole dungeon?

866
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:50,280
Fuck, okay.

867
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:53,180
What is this?

868
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:57,480
Yeah, this is a...

869
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:58,560
This dungeon is shared with everybody.

870
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:01,560
But you don't fight any...

871
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:07,080
You can't fight anybody until you go to like a specific area.

872
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:11,760
Yeah, but you don't... You can't kill anybody until you go to a specific area.

873
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:13,300
Fuck this guy up.

874
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:13,880
Here, here.

875
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:16,120
I haven't found a single porter.

876
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:18,620
This is a good legger.

877
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:20,020
Someone's been here.

878
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:24,940
What is the point of blocking if it's not even actually blocking?

879
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:26,100
Okay.

880
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:30,740
You're blocking because you're playing block wars, you know?

881
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:33,000
I'm gonna fucking kill you.

882
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:33,420
Damn.

883
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:38,560
You know, in my country we kill people for saying shit like that.

884
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:39,300
I'm gonna die.

885
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:43,400
Hold on, let me...

886
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:45,020
I'm so lost, I'm gonna be so for real.

887
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:47,020
Oh, hello.

888
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:47,600
I'm gaming.

889
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:49,520
We're so fucked, dammit.

890
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:52,040
Oh god, oh god.

891
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:54,140
Pile up, pile up, pile up.

892
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:56,160
Wait, are you guys dying?

893
00:38:57,360 --> 00:39:00,480
We're literally getting like destroyed by like five people at the same time.

894
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:01,880
Wait, do you guys need help?

895
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:03,160
No, we're winning.

896
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:05,940
Oh, we're so back, dammit.

897
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:06,700
Holy shit.

898
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:07,620
Goddamn.

899
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:10,340
Wait, wait, dammit.

900
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:11,140
Where am I?

901
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:13,880
Oh shit.

902
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:14,960
Oh shit.

903
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,040
Loot, loot, loot.

904
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:18,620
Okay.

905
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:22,360
We're so back, dude.

906
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:23,520
Holy shit.

907
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:24,960
I think I got it already.

908
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:28,460
There's no team damage, you stupid.

909
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:31,940
I need more high value loot.

910
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:34,560
I bumped into a different team.

911
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,020
Wait, someone died already?

912
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:37,480
Oh shit.

913
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:39,480
Multiple people died already.

914
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:43,480
Have you guys found like a place to...

915
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,100
Oh, like the portals?

916
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:48,260
No, we haven't.

917
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,340
Kill, kill, kill.

918
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:51,540
Oh no, we can't kill.

919
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:52,000
Fuck.

920
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:57,440
I was so excited, man.

921
00:39:57,580 --> 00:39:58,440
I was so excited.

922
00:39:58,540 --> 00:40:01,580
I don't even know if I have enough stuff.

923
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:02,640
That's fucked up.

924
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:04,420
Do you need like help?

925
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:05,560
Can you talk to someone?

926
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:08,600
Nah, man, I just need to like cope some way or another, you know?

927
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:09,240
I got it.

928
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:10,600
Guys, how the fuck?

929
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:14,020
Oh, so many chicken!

930
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:17,540
Oh, chain mail, nice.

931
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:17,980
Okay.

932
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:19,820
Oh, people are dying.

933
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:22,440
Guys, there's so many power.

934
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:23,280
They're all dying.

935
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:24,600
Help me, I don't know how to get this.

936
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:28,660
Wait, how much?

937
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:29,720
Five minutes, okay.

938
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:33,160
Yeah, guys, if nobody dies, we're fucking good already.

939
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:35,920
You can revive people, that's the thing.

940
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:36,560
You can revive.

941
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,180
But don't they lose all their shit?

942
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:39,780
No, they don't, unless you revive.

943
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:41,940
Oh, you just revive?

944
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:42,240
Okay.

945
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:44,160
You can steal their stuff.

946
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:48,520
If you see somebody dead, you can steal their stuff.

947
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:51,160
Because that's what Wolfie and I did last time.

948
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:54,360
We're in a really bad area where it's like...

949
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:55,540
Is it collapsing, actually?

950
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:57,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you guys gotta get out.

951
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:58,080
Oh, fuck.

952
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:00,220
I'm trying to figure out how to get out.

953
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:01,360
Yeah, fuck that, let's go, let's go, let's go.

954
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:05,040
Wolfie, I'm gonna follow you.

955
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:06,120
There's no fall damage, right?

956
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:06,920
If I fall down?

957
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:08,580
Yeah, you can fall down.

958
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:09,660
Will I live?

959
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:14,320
Okay, I'm following you because you know where the exit is.

960
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:15,480
Holy shit!

961
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,200
Fun fact, I don't, but we'll be fine.

962
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:18,680
Oh, zombie, zombie, careful!

963
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:21,700
Oh, is the whole team here?

964
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:22,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

965
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:25,000
It's over here, follow the leader!

966
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:26,420
Hello, gamers.

967
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:27,300
I'm...

968
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:30,980
I have a lot of stuff, I need to get rid of stuff.

969
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:32,820
Hello, my fellow younglings.

970
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:34,340
If I get rid of my leather...

971
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:35,720
Oh, I killed him, killed him!

972
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:39,360
If I get rid of my leather, is that okay?

973
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:40,420
I'm so good, I'm gonna kill people!

974
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:41,740
Yeah, you can drop the leather, yeah.

975
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:42,980
Doki, doki, doki, doki, here, here.

976
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:46,940
Oh, I have, okay, okay, wait, I'm getting rid of my leather.

977
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:47,240
Oh, you have pants already?

978
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:48,140
Yeah, yeah, I have pants.

979
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:49,620
Wait, I have chain mail.

980
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:52,180
Oh, there's a whole team down here.

981
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:53,700
Hold on.

982
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:54,040
Okay.

983
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:57,780
We need to be careful, because I don't think this is like...

984
00:41:57,780 --> 00:41:58,960
This might be a little scary.

985
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:00,260
Can we kill people now?

986
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:02,240
I'm gonna die.

987
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:06,120
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

988
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:07,520
Wait, wait, are you down there?

989
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:09,160
Should we go down there with you?

990
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:12,020
I also have thoughts like that, don't worry, I understand.

991
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:13,400
I'm gonna come back up.

992
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:14,300
Okay.

993
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:17,600
Red team's already been down here, but I'm just grabbing a couple things they missed.

994
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:18,940
Wait, Michi's dead again?

995
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:21,260
Dead team, am I right, guys?

996
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:22,380
So true.

997
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:24,760
Yeah, yeah, you tell him, bro.

998
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:25,800
You fucking tell him, bro.

999
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:26,360
Yeah!

1000
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:29,140
Let's continue forward, gang.

1001
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,140
We got it.

1002
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:33,240
Oh, shit.

1003
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:35,960
Oh, god, oh, god, oh, god.

1004
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:38,340
Why is everything crumbling?

1005
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:40,040
There's chain mail stuff here.

1006
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:41,540
Pull and weave, pull and weave, pull and weave.

1007
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:42,800
Nice!

1008
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:48,400
Oh, we have to get out of here, because our entire area is collapsing.

1009
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:49,040
Oh, god.

1010
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:50,860
Oh, god.

1011
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:52,480
Die, die, die.

1012
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:52,980
Nice.

1013
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:54,220
Nice, nice, nice.

1014
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:55,200
Heck yeah.

1015
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:57,700
Oh, unlooted area, nice.

1016
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:01,260
Bro, this is such a cool game mode.

1017
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:02,220
I like this a lot.

1018
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:03,040
What the fuck?

1019
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:06,000
Go away wither skeleton, man.

1020
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:07,560
Looting.

1021
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:10,420
This is like itching my loot goblin, you know, like mine.

1022
00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:11,400
Do you have iron sword?

1023
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:12,780
Oh, I do.

1024
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:14,480
Oh, god.

1025
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:16,120
We're good.

1026
00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:16,880
Wait, I see a button.

1027
00:43:18,580 --> 00:43:19,300
Oh, hello.

1028
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:20,360
Jesus Christ.

1029
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:21,960
People are just escaping.

1030
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:25,240
Sorry, we can kill people yet.

1031
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:26,920
We're leaving early.

1032
00:43:28,580 --> 00:43:31,120
People are leaving already, but there's so much shit to loot.

1033
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:32,200
There's two minutes left.

1034
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:33,120
We have to find a portal.

1035
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:35,440
Wait, I'm in a PvP trunk, I think.

1036
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:37,860
Does it tell you that you can PvP?

1037
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:39,860
Yeah, yeah, get out of there.

1038
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:41,780
You're probably in a PvP trunk, yes.

1039
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:43,720
There's a boss, there's a boss.

1040
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:44,780
Oh, god.

1041
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:47,780
There's a boss in the...

1042
00:43:47,780 --> 00:43:50,220
Follow me, follow me.

1043
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:51,540
I have dodgers here.

1044
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,060
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1045
00:43:58,060 --> 00:43:58,480
My bad.

1046
00:43:59,740 --> 00:44:00,640
Over here, over here, over here.

1047
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:02,000
How long until it collapses?

1048
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:04,640
I don't know, but just...

1049
00:44:06,140 --> 00:44:06,940
It's orangey?

1050
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:09,780
Yeah, but Feinberg...

1051
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:11,900
Feinberg fucking always fights the boss.

1052
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:12,360
Yeah.

1053
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:13,520
True.

1054
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:20,660
We're better off, like, sporting solid points than going for, like, super risky things.

1055
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,440
We have a minute left.

1056
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:27,340
We have to find one now, or we don't bank anything.

1057
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:29,300
Oh, shit, the game's only one...

1058
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:30,320
One minute left!

1059
00:44:30,620 --> 00:44:31,180
Stop looting!

1060
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:32,200
We gotta find the portal!

1061
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:36,200
Yeah, there's a portal in this trunk.

1062
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:37,680
We need to find purple candles.

1063
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:39,760
Guys, look for purple candles!

1064
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:41,160
Don't go that way.

1065
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:41,960
Go back, go back.

1066
00:44:42,260 --> 00:44:43,320
Wait, wait!

1067
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:44,220
Oh my god, I couldn't...

1068
00:44:44,220 --> 00:44:45,700
Wait, I can't... Oh my god, okay.

1069
00:44:45,940 --> 00:44:47,400
Let's find the portal.

1070
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:49,180
Yeah, we have 55 seconds.

1071
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:51,920
Stop looting!

1072
00:44:52,060 --> 00:44:53,060
We gotta find portal!

1073
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:55,060
Olive?

1074
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:57,680
Oh boy.

1075
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:58,980
Fuck, fuck, fuck, I'm freaking out.

1076
00:44:59,080 --> 00:44:59,740
I'm actually freaking out.

1077
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:01,340
Where the hell is the portal?

1078
00:45:01,620 --> 00:45:02,080
Hold on.

1079
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:04,040
Why didn't we find portal earlier?

1080
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:07,700
Is it not shown in the map?

1081
00:45:08,060 --> 00:45:09,020
No, we have to follow candles.

1082
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:11,080
We're in a portal chunk.

1083
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:12,080
We just need to find it.

1084
00:45:12,140 --> 00:45:13,460
I'm gonna go up here.

1085
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:15,460
I'm expecting it to be up somewhere.

1086
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:17,200
Oh, all the fucking sides are like crumbling.

1087
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:18,800
30 seconds.

1088
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:21,560
Come on, Wolfie!

1089
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:22,900
You're the leader!

1090
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:27,040
It's okay, we don't need points anyway.

1091
00:45:27,620 --> 00:45:29,920
We don't need points.

1092
00:45:30,140 --> 00:45:31,480
Why is purple candle spotted?

1093
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:32,040
Goodbye.

1094
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:34,480
Goodbye, cruel world.

1095
00:45:36,340 --> 00:45:41,260
Goodbye, cruel world.

1096
00:45:41,460 --> 00:45:43,640
We didn't need points.

1097
00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:46,340
You know what?

1098
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,100
I blame Wolfie.

1099
00:45:48,460 --> 00:45:50,980
I blame Wolfie for that.

1100
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:52,440
Wow.

1101
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:55,580
Dude, it was literally behind us.

1102
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:57,100
That's crazy.

1103
00:45:57,640 --> 00:45:58,860
That's insane.

1104
00:45:59,580 --> 00:46:00,320
Wait, where?

1105
00:46:00,620 --> 00:46:02,240
I didn't think about that.

1106
00:46:02,340 --> 00:46:05,300
I think they might have reduced the game time.

1107
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:08,000
Oh, there's a portal.

1108
00:46:08,660 --> 00:46:10,120
Wait, what do you mean you think?

1109
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:12,860
You're part of the portal team!

1110
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:14,700
What do you mean you think?

1111
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:16,920
I don't make everything, I promise.

1112
00:46:17,180 --> 00:46:18,040
I don't make everything.

1113
00:46:19,220 --> 00:46:19,700
Zero...

1114
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:21,800
How do we get 23 points?

1115
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:24,580
I went to a merchant.

1116
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:26,580
And I sold two stone swords.

1117
00:46:26,580 --> 00:46:27,180
Oh...

1118
00:46:27,180 --> 00:46:28,600
Of course, fine.

1119
00:46:30,220 --> 00:46:31,400
Don't worry, guys.

1120
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:32,480
Hey, guys.

1121
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:34,980
Oh my god, guys.

1122
00:46:35,140 --> 00:46:37,900
I might need a substitute after that first game, guys.

1123
00:46:38,260 --> 00:46:39,760
I don't think...

1124
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:45,900
I'm going to erase my existence from this team.

1125
00:46:49,620 --> 00:46:50,880
Winner POV, okay?

1126
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:52,740
Yeah, winner POV, dude.

1127
00:46:52,740 --> 00:46:56,560
Look at all these fucking streamers, man.

1128
00:46:56,900 --> 00:46:59,180
Guys, guys, please.

1129
00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:01,540
Guys, I want to fight.

1130
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:03,580
I want to fight a portal.

1131
00:47:03,740 --> 00:47:04,520
Guys, please.

1132
00:47:04,820 --> 00:47:06,280
I want to fight a portal.

1133
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:08,380
And everybody's like...

1134
00:47:08,380 --> 00:47:09,460
Simple, fumble.

1135
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:12,100
We will come back another game.

1136
00:47:12,780 --> 00:47:17,040
That kind of sucks because that is literally the game we could have won with our current skill set.

1137
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:20,040
You're so inspirational.

1138
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:21,700
That was an inspirational speech, thank you.

1139
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:23,280
Thank you, appreciate it.

1140
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:25,060
I thought I was a loose goblin.

1141
00:47:25,660 --> 00:47:28,700
Bring up Mimi and bring up Nine.

1142
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:35,780
If I leave now, I keep my 100% win rate.

1143
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:38,500
No, no, no.

1144
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:41,740
We are bottom 10, but that's okay.

1145
00:47:42,780 --> 00:47:45,560
Wait, what are you guys' score individually?

1146
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:46,140
Check, check.

1147
00:47:46,140 --> 00:47:48,760
Where do I see that?

1148
00:47:52,940 --> 00:47:53,740
35, fuck!

1149
00:47:55,020 --> 00:47:55,360
Wait, what?

1150
00:47:55,460 --> 00:47:56,560
I'm 31st.

1151
00:47:57,240 --> 00:47:57,640
23.

1152
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:00,140
Look at me, look at me.

1153
00:48:00,740 --> 00:48:02,220
You know what I'm surprised?

1154
00:48:03,180 --> 00:48:04,480
That phantom's not boost.

1155
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:06,740
What's the next one?

1156
00:48:06,740 --> 00:48:07,880
This is the first game, guys.

1157
00:48:08,660 --> 00:48:11,060
I didn't see a portal the entire game.

1158
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:14,300
The portal shows up at the last two minutes.

1159
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:14,940
33.

1160
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:17,700
The last two minutes, that's when the portal showed up.

1161
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:20,880
Because it says on the screen, like, oh, portals are opening now.

1162
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:22,840
And it was like two minutes left.

1163
00:48:23,140 --> 00:48:24,200
I'm going to be so honest.

1164
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:25,480
I kind of forgot.

1165
00:48:25,980 --> 00:48:26,800
Oh shit, let's go.

1166
00:48:27,060 --> 00:48:28,240
I will take the blame.

1167
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:29,900
This was my responsibility.

1168
00:48:30,260 --> 00:48:31,760
I forgot, I was a big attention.

1169
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:33,580
It's okay, boss, don't worry about it.

1170
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:36,260
What do you mean?

1171
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:38,200
Okay, okay.

1172
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:40,880
I like that one.

1173
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:45,260
The moment in the team when you have to be the responsible one.

1174
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:46,820
And I was like, team, guys, team.

1175
00:48:46,980 --> 00:48:48,060
We got five portals, guys.

1176
00:48:48,180 --> 00:48:50,520
I'm sorry, I wasn't paying attention.

1177
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:55,880
That's really good.

1178
00:48:56,080 --> 00:49:00,520
That moment, you know, what I have to do to see it.

1179
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:02,080
I have to be the straight man.

1180
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:05,040
Bro, the knockback, holy shit.

1181
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,780
You know, some things were wrong.

1182
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:08,960
Can we order off?

1183
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:10,120
Yeah, we're coming.

1184
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:13,800
Dude,

1185
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:17,560
this is so much fun.

1186
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:20,500
Wait, wait, wait, who's going to be cooking?

1187
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:23,000
Probably me.

1188
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:23,400
Wolfie.

1189
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:26,040
Yeah, Wolfie.

1190
00:49:26,780 --> 00:49:28,400
Don't we need two people cooking?

1191
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:29,200
We need two.

1192
00:49:30,540 --> 00:49:31,320
We're going to hit them.

1193
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:33,880
Who wants to be the delivery person?

1194
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:37,080
Yeah, that was me last turn.

1195
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:39,760
I think we should all gather in the start, no?

1196
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:40,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1197
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:41,520
Ohio!

1198
00:49:42,620 --> 00:49:44,540
I can get the fish in the...

1199
00:49:44,540 --> 00:49:45,720
I'll get the fish and meat.

1200
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:48,860
I can do whatever the fuck you want me to do.

1201
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:49,920
I don't know what the hell this is.

1202
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:51,660
I'll go meat first.

1203
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:54,520
I feel like you'd look good in a chef's outfit.

1204
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:56,900
I'll go meat first and then somebody else go fish.

1205
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:57,900
Yeah, I'll be chef.

1206
00:49:58,340 --> 00:50:00,160
Okay, so...

1207
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:01,800
Demi, Doki, gather shit.

1208
00:50:02,340 --> 00:50:03,580
Wolfie, Hakka, cook.

1209
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:04,200
I deliver.

1210
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:05,220
Okay.

1211
00:50:05,420 --> 00:50:06,320
Alright, yeah.

1212
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:08,460
Are we in Ohio?

1213
00:50:08,860 --> 00:50:10,460
I feel like Hakka should deliver, no?

1214
00:50:11,260 --> 00:50:12,540
We're in Ohio?

1215
00:50:13,020 --> 00:50:14,260
I've never been to Ohio.

1216
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:17,080
Okay, Americans, tell me...

1217
00:50:18,020 --> 00:50:21,560
If you can, tell me positive things about Ohio.

1218
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:22,220
Or not.

1219
00:50:24,380 --> 00:50:27,080
Whoever wants to be the second chef...

1220
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:27,880
with me...

1221
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:29,800
will be the delivery person as well.

1222
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:31,660
There's an Elytra thing...

1223
00:50:31,660 --> 00:50:35,020
that could be very useful for delivery.

1224
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:37,760
Because the delivery area is like...

1225
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:39,620
a raised platform...

1226
00:50:39,620 --> 00:50:42,680
and you can fly down to the delivery thingy.

1227
00:50:42,740 --> 00:50:43,100
You know what?

1228
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:44,180
I can be second chef.

1229
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:45,020
I've done this before.

1230
00:50:45,180 --> 00:50:46,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1231
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:47,680
I think Lion should be second chef.

1232
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:50,060
You're stuck to gathering wheat.

1233
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:51,640
You fucking peasant!

1234
00:50:51,940 --> 00:50:54,060
Okay, so Lion, you select the Elytra...

1235
00:50:54,060 --> 00:50:55,840
by clicking the second inventory slot.

1236
00:50:56,260 --> 00:50:56,900
Not again!

1237
00:50:57,380 --> 00:50:59,900
Then for gathering...

1238
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:01,100
Why is there a goal on the floor?

1239
00:51:02,740 --> 00:51:04,980
There's no mushroom on the floor too.

1240
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:07,600
So I don't think that was supposed to...

1241
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:08,460
I'll go right side.

1242
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:10,000
Somebody go left side and somebody go front.

1243
00:51:10,220 --> 00:51:12,120
Yeah, I'll get the wheat and the fish.

1244
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:13,680
I'll get the wheat.

1245
00:51:14,860 --> 00:51:15,960
Wheat is in the back.

1246
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:18,300
I'll go in the back too.

1247
00:51:18,740 --> 00:51:20,440
Just gather stuff.

1248
00:51:21,420 --> 00:51:22,920
Gather stuff first...

1249
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:25,300
and then we'll figure it out.

1250
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:27,360
I have no clue.

1251
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:30,380
Oh, we're so ready.

1252
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:32,380
Maybe it's now collecting gold from the floor.

1253
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:34,280
So the wheat is over there.

1254
00:51:34,660 --> 00:51:36,540
Below the big wheat is the wheat.

1255
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:37,040
Oh, there we go.

1256
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:43,020
I'm locked in.

1257
00:51:43,860 --> 00:51:45,100
I'm locked in.

1258
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:47,140
I'm doing all the Minecraft pro stuff.

1259
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:49,400
I jump and swing.

1260
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:51,520
I jump and swing.

1261
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:53,780
I jump and swing.

1262
00:51:53,780 --> 00:51:55,640
We're in one of the...

1263
00:51:56,100 --> 00:51:57,480
I'm locked in.

1264
00:51:57,880 --> 00:51:58,920
I'm getting fish now.

1265
00:52:00,340 --> 00:52:02,260
I'm gonna get a couple of apples.

1266
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:03,600
Oh yeah, we got lemons.

1267
00:52:04,060 --> 00:52:05,200
When life gives you lemons.

1268
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:08,480
Alright, fish time.

1269
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:09,840
I'm gonna put some stuff in the chest now.

1270
00:52:10,100 --> 00:52:11,380
Wait, people are already fishing.

1271
00:52:11,580 --> 00:52:12,480
I guess I'll do more meat.

1272
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:17,140
Dude, this music is banger.

1273
00:52:17,340 --> 00:52:18,260
Who did this?

1274
00:52:18,860 --> 00:52:19,700
I'm doing meta.

1275
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:20,300
I learned.

1276
00:52:20,780 --> 00:52:23,140
I learned from the first tournament.

1277
00:52:23,660 --> 00:52:24,880
It only takes me one game.

1278
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:29,260
It only takes me one game to figure this out.

1279
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:36,640
Does anyone have pumpkins?

1280
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:39,180
I can go get pumpkins.

1281
00:52:39,620 --> 00:52:46,420
We have a carrot.

1282
00:52:46,420 --> 00:52:48,320
There's carrots right in there.

1283
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:52,280
I got all the vegetables.

1284
00:52:52,540 --> 00:52:54,480
Potato, wheat, and carrots.

1285
00:52:57,460 --> 00:52:59,080
I'm grabbing apples now.

1286
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:00,630
I'm grabbing pumpkins.

1287
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:04,860
Yeah, I'm currently not in the kitchen.

1288
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:06,020
I'm grabbing pumpkins right now.

1289
00:53:06,420 --> 00:53:07,940
We need to...

1290
00:53:07,940 --> 00:53:09,720
Rush order will expire soon.

1291
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:12,420
Yeah, we need to rush order stuff.

1292
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:14,800
I'm getting the pumpkin related stuff.

1293
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:15,320
Eggs?

1294
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:16,340
Oh, fuck.

1295
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:17,980
There's eggs already in the chest.

1296
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:19,640
There's already eggs in the chest.

1297
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:21,500
I'm on my way.

1298
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:24,740
I have lemons.

1299
00:53:29,020 --> 00:53:30,880
I'm giving you apples, oranges, and lemons.

1300
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:32,300
Is there anything we need right now?

1301
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:33,200
I can get them.

1302
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:33,920
Eggs.

1303
00:53:35,220 --> 00:53:35,960
Okay, eggs.

1304
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:39,020
Once you order ready, you can deliver it.

1305
00:53:39,380 --> 00:53:41,360
Rush order will expire in 15 seconds.

1306
00:53:42,020 --> 00:53:43,420
I'm gonna take this stuff out.

1307
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:44,960
I don't think we're gonna finish it in time.

1308
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:45,800
Where do I drop shit?

1309
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:46,020
Here?

1310
00:53:46,540 --> 00:53:47,120
In the chest.

1311
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:52,580
Where the fuck is my customer?

1312
00:53:53,820 --> 00:53:55,540
There should be a compass in the middle of your food.

1313
00:53:55,540 --> 00:53:56,360
Hurry up, deliver boy!

1314
00:53:57,960 --> 00:54:01,480
Yeah, it's like saying 56 meters away from customer.

1315
00:54:02,220 --> 00:54:02,780
Do we kill the cows?

1316
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:04,540
It should have an arrow and everything.

1317
00:54:05,380 --> 00:54:06,760
Wait, maybe we should swap.

1318
00:54:07,420 --> 00:54:08,460
I'm still gonna farm.

1319
00:54:09,460 --> 00:54:10,780
Is there anything specific we need?

1320
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:13,000
We need pumpkin.

1321
00:54:13,860 --> 00:54:14,580
I got pumpkin.

1322
00:54:14,900 --> 00:54:16,100
Where do we get chocolate?

1323
00:54:17,060 --> 00:54:18,720
It's in one of the chests.

1324
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:20,520
Hold up, I'll figure it out.

1325
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:21,240
Do I get more wheat?

1326
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:25,440
We don't have enough space for wheat anyway.

1327
00:54:25,700 --> 00:54:27,500
I'm gonna put the egg in the floor.

1328
00:54:27,980 --> 00:54:28,760
The chest is full.

1329
00:54:33,140 --> 00:54:34,600
I'm gonna upgrade the chest.

1330
00:54:35,060 --> 00:54:37,460
And then I will upgrade our looting.

1331
00:54:37,460 --> 00:54:41,220
What the fuck do you mean I'm a natural environment, you motherfuckers?

1332
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:48,520
We need pumpkin pie and golden carrot.

1333
00:54:49,140 --> 00:54:53,120
We have a lot of ingredients for pumpkin and carrots already.

1334
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:57,000
Somebody can get a hoe.

1335
00:54:57,460 --> 00:54:58,280
Thank you.

1336
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:00,320
Get a hoe upgrade.

1337
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:03,960
If you're dedicated to getting ingredients.

1338
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:07,000
Right click this thing and click the hoe.

1339
00:55:09,220 --> 00:55:12,860
Put it in.

1340
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:15,340
My inventory is full now.

1341
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:17,960
Potato, potato, carrot.

1342
00:55:18,220 --> 00:55:18,260
Delivery.

1343
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:20,040
I'll just deliver it.

1344
00:55:20,620 --> 00:55:23,320
I'll do a mushroom stew.

1345
00:55:24,260 --> 00:55:25,680
I'll get more meat.

1346
00:55:27,820 --> 00:55:28,920
Guys, I'm stupid.

1347
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:30,980
Do you have a delivery?

1348
00:55:31,580 --> 00:55:32,740
I'm working on one.

1349
00:55:32,860 --> 00:55:33,820
There's one ready.

1350
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:34,900
I'll just keep cooking.

1351
00:55:35,460 --> 00:55:36,560
I got the other one.

1352
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:39,300
Damn, I'm locked the fuck in.

1353
00:55:39,380 --> 00:55:40,060
You guys are right.

1354
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:42,460
Fucking natural habitat.

1355
00:55:43,100 --> 00:55:43,960
There's only six teams?

1356
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:48,240
It's not the number of orders.

1357
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:48,820
It's how

1358
00:55:51,860 --> 00:55:53,480
the points of the orders.

1359
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:56,340
I'll take care of most of the crafting.

1360
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:56,920
Thank you.

1361
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:57,100
Thank you.

1362
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:00,800
Gathering.

1363
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:02,560
I think we need more stoves.

1364
00:56:04,140 --> 00:56:06,000
We need to buy more upgrades.

1365
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:08,160
The thing is not open.

1366
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:10,380
There's no bosses in this anymore.

1367
00:56:13,140 --> 00:56:14,320
Feels like home.

1368
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:18,160
We need somebody to cook chicken.

1369
00:56:18,940 --> 00:56:19,940
You guys need more meat?

1370
00:56:20,860 --> 00:56:22,940
We need mushroom stew.

1371
00:56:23,580 --> 00:56:24,760
We do not have a lot of mushrooms.

1372
00:56:25,540 --> 00:56:26,780
More wheat and stuff?

1373
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:28,280
How many do you need?

1374
00:56:28,340 --> 00:56:28,560
One?

1375
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:29,180
What do I get?

1376
00:56:33,340 --> 00:56:34,940
Ready for delivery, I think.

1377
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:36,620
I'll make a couple more.

1378
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:38,600
I'm just going to keep providing.

1379
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:42,060
I'm just going to help with cooking and stuff.

1380
00:56:44,740 --> 00:56:48,400
I am literally getting carrots, potatoes, and wheat.

1381
00:56:48,660 --> 00:56:52,740
Order ready.

1382
00:56:52,740 --> 00:56:53,800
Ready for delivery.

1383
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:56,020
I'm working on one right now.

1384
00:56:56,180 --> 00:56:57,980
We need cooked mutton.

1385
00:56:58,180 --> 00:56:58,860
Is there cooked mutton?

1386
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:01,980
Let's get some more.

1387
00:57:03,100 --> 00:57:03,880
Guys, we need mutton.

1388
00:57:04,460 --> 00:57:06,360
Dude, I love this freaking BGM.

1389
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:08,520
I have more fish and meat.

1390
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:13,680
Pumpkin pie.

1391
00:57:14,900 --> 00:57:15,500
Lemons.

1392
00:57:15,820 --> 00:57:16,980
Another order ready.

1393
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:20,460
Grab more resources.

1394
00:57:20,460 --> 00:57:23,280
Yeah, my natural habits as a farmer.

1395
00:57:24,100 --> 00:57:25,340
Do you guys need sugar?

1396
00:57:26,740 --> 00:57:27,220
Sure.

1397
00:57:27,740 --> 00:57:28,680
Okay, I'll grab sugar.

1398
00:57:30,340 --> 00:57:33,980
If you have an abundance of one resource, wheat, just decompose it.

1399
00:57:34,540 --> 00:57:36,240
Okay, order ready.

1400
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:37,960
Order ready.

1401
00:57:38,700 --> 00:57:39,220
I'll take the rush.

1402
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:40,840
Okay, I got vegetables.

1403
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:43,840
I have sugar.

1404
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:47,700
I'll grab more mushrooms.

1405
00:57:48,740 --> 00:57:50,720
Wait, what's the gold nuggets for?

1406
00:57:51,140 --> 00:57:53,660
You can just drop it on the floor.

1407
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:54,740
We have infinite of that.

1408
00:57:55,020 --> 00:57:57,620
Alright, I'm getting more vegetables.

1409
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:01,120
I'll focus on the meat and fish.

1410
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:03,200
You can just focus on veggies, Hakka.

1411
00:58:04,380 --> 00:58:05,740
Ready to deliver.

1412
00:58:07,260 --> 00:58:10,080
I think we're good on sugar.

1413
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:13,120
We need more meat probably, just in general.

1414
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:14,040
Fish.

1415
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:15,580
Should I help Doki?

1416
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:18,320
Order ready.

1417
00:58:18,660 --> 00:58:20,040
Alright, let me just drop this and I'll help you, Doki.

1418
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:21,420
Guys, order up.

1419
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:23,400
Do we need fruit?

1420
00:58:23,780 --> 00:58:24,940
We need cookies.

1421
00:58:25,260 --> 00:58:25,840
Get fruit.

1422
00:58:26,980 --> 00:58:28,080
Go back to the trees.

1423
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:31,000
It's the trees and the sugar canes.

1424
00:58:31,940 --> 00:58:33,080
I'll get fruit and you get the meat.

1425
00:58:33,100 --> 00:58:33,700
Are you making cookies?

1426
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:37,240
Delivery ready.

1427
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:39,500
We're working on one right now.

1428
00:58:39,540 --> 00:58:40,120
Is there a new one ready?

1429
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,260
Oh, this one's just oranges and apples.

1430
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:45,040
I've got the lemons.

1431
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:45,660
Can you get the oranges?

1432
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:46,760
Yeah, yeah.

1433
00:58:47,560 --> 00:58:48,900
Wait, you want to get lemons?

1434
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:51,480
We can have someone else maybe...

1435
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:53,320
Sorry, what did you say?

1436
00:58:53,820 --> 00:58:54,400
You want lemons?

1437
00:58:54,920 --> 00:58:56,220
No, we're good.

1438
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:58,460
Just getting a couple.

1439
00:58:59,620 --> 00:59:00,980
I'll grab more meat.

1440
00:59:02,560 --> 00:59:06,280
This is a very fast-paced game, so I'm just spamming.

1441
00:59:07,780 --> 00:59:08,420
Let's go.

1442
00:59:08,900 --> 00:59:09,860
I'm delivering this thing.

1443
00:59:09,860 --> 00:59:10,960
Oh, it's right there.

1444
00:59:11,120 --> 00:59:12,420
Just deliver!

1445
00:59:14,120 --> 00:59:15,640
Just keep delivering!

1446
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:17,800
You got potatoes?

1447
00:59:18,820 --> 00:59:19,720
This shit's raw!

1448
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:21,340
Eat it!

1449
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:22,160
Eat it up!

1450
00:59:22,620 --> 00:59:27,160
Oh, that's in the chest.

1451
00:59:27,720 --> 00:59:28,820
Right order is ready now.

1452
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,240
Two minutes left.

1453
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:33,440
I put meat in there.

1454
00:59:34,820 --> 00:59:35,340
What else do we need?

1455
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:36,240
Cooked salmon.

1456
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:37,480
We need cooked salmon.

1457
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:39,100
Oh wait, I need to put on my sugar.

1458
00:59:39,540 --> 00:59:41,120
How the fuck do I get fish?

1459
00:59:42,020 --> 00:59:44,020
We have salmon in there, didn't we?

1460
00:59:44,220 --> 00:59:44,820
Or do we need more?

1461
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:47,840
We have rolling carrots now.

1462
00:59:48,120 --> 00:59:49,420
Yeah, we have a lot of salmon.

1463
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:01,560
We're doing pretty good, guys.

1464
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:02,200
Let's go.

1465
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:02,660
Nice!

1466
01:00:04,540 --> 01:00:06,780
Okay, I got rush order pretty much done.

1467
01:00:07,100 --> 01:00:08,140
Just a little bit more.

1468
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:09,620
I think there's one order that's not being delivered.

1469
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:11,420
And if another one is done soon, then I'm going to...

1470
01:00:12,380 --> 01:00:14,200
We have one minute left, so...

1471
01:00:16,040 --> 01:00:18,780
We have one minute left, so she gets some deliveries in.

1472
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:21,020
Rush order is ready for delivery.

1473
01:00:21,860 --> 01:00:22,300
Give me a second.

1474
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:23,440
I'm done with this one now.

1475
01:00:24,060 --> 01:00:24,440
Okay, okay.

1476
01:00:25,240 --> 01:00:26,040
Rush order.

1477
01:00:27,100 --> 01:00:28,520
I'll go get sugar.

1478
01:00:29,160 --> 01:00:30,020
Okay, okay, okay.

1479
01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:32,680
We need pumpkins, Haku.

1480
01:00:32,940 --> 01:00:33,880
If you're still getting some.

1481
01:00:34,940 --> 01:00:36,840
I can get it, I can get it, I can get it.

1482
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:37,700
Okay.

1483
01:00:38,260 --> 01:00:39,260
I fell in the water!

1484
01:00:40,900 --> 01:00:41,600
40 seconds.

1485
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:43,320
How many pumpkins?

1486
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:46,200
I'm going to get five for now so you guys can make stuff from it.

1487
01:00:46,740 --> 01:00:48,640
I put more vegetables and shit there.

1488
01:00:49,560 --> 01:00:50,160
Meat, right?

1489
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:52,600
30 seconds.

1490
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:55,320
We need help just crafting things right now.

1491
01:00:55,320 --> 01:00:55,860
Alright.

1492
01:00:56,840 --> 01:00:57,960
Cod, cod, cod.

1493
01:00:58,680 --> 01:01:01,520
I don't have space for it.

1494
01:01:01,720 --> 01:01:02,960
Found him, found him, found him.

1495
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:04,520
There's pumpkins in there.

1496
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:08,460
Cod in here.

1497
01:01:08,660 --> 01:01:09,380
Order two is ready.

1498
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:11,860
Order two, 10.

1499
01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:13,520
Pumpkin pie?

1500
01:01:15,340 --> 01:01:16,400
Just focus on the right.

1501
01:01:16,540 --> 01:01:17,300
Do we have a baked potato?

1502
01:01:18,700 --> 01:01:19,440
Yeah, yeah, we do.

1503
01:01:19,860 --> 01:01:21,580
Put it in the right thing.

1504
01:01:21,940 --> 01:01:22,320
The right order.

1505
01:01:22,320 --> 01:01:24,480
We did good, we did good.

1506
01:01:24,980 --> 01:01:25,820
Pretty solid.

1507
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:27,100
Jesus!

1508
01:01:27,940 --> 01:01:29,580
Now that's very stressful, I know.

1509
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:31,720
That's a lot going on.

1510
01:01:32,560 --> 01:01:33,360
Wait, can we still deliver?

1511
01:01:33,740 --> 01:01:34,820
Yeah, you can, you can.

1512
01:01:35,500 --> 01:01:37,740
Do we still have any delivery stuff?

1513
01:01:38,620 --> 01:01:38,900
No.

1514
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:40,840
Okay, we're good.

1515
01:01:41,120 --> 01:01:42,300
The other got 21.

1516
01:01:43,240 --> 01:01:45,600
It also depends on the order itself.

1517
01:01:46,500 --> 01:01:48,320
We got four.

1518
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:50,400
We'll take that.

1519
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:51,120
That's very good.

1520
01:01:51,900 --> 01:01:52,580
Very nice.

1521
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:56,440
50%.

1522
01:01:58,400 --> 01:01:59,920
We locked the fuck in.

1523
01:02:00,100 --> 01:02:02,200
Feinberg team still got first, that's crazy.

1524
01:02:04,260 --> 01:02:05,880
Fourth place, let's go!

1525
01:02:06,100 --> 01:02:06,940
How is it crazy?

1526
01:02:07,240 --> 01:02:08,240
It's Feinberg.

1527
01:02:08,860 --> 01:02:09,820
Let's go!

1528
01:02:10,360 --> 01:02:11,760
It is Feinberg, that's true.

1529
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:12,400
That's crazy.

1530
01:02:12,900 --> 01:02:16,440
If you have Feinberg on your team, you remove one player.

1531
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:17,320
That's all I'm saying.

1532
01:02:18,540 --> 01:02:20,260
He's literally two players.

1533
01:02:20,340 --> 01:02:21,360
Kind of unfair.

1534
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:26,980
Or he plays with one arm.

1535
01:02:27,820 --> 01:02:28,280
That's all good.

1536
01:02:28,780 --> 01:02:33,240
Things are very close right now because of the first game having zero points for half the lobby.

1537
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:34,980
That's all good.

1538
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:41,120
Did they nerf the spawn rate of the portal or something?

1539
01:02:41,940 --> 01:02:45,540
No, I think we just generally moved a little slower.

1540
01:02:45,540 --> 01:02:47,340
Which is obviously not good.

1541
01:02:47,560 --> 01:02:48,080
Really?

1542
01:02:48,260 --> 01:02:49,540
That shit feels fast, dude.

1543
01:02:50,280 --> 01:02:53,800
We were all grouped up together too because we didn't want to get lost.

1544
01:02:55,780 --> 01:02:59,900
Because last time we were split up trying to find portals.

1545
01:03:00,540 --> 01:03:00,800
Exactly.

1546
01:03:01,220 --> 01:03:04,060
I was in two of them.

1547
01:03:04,420 --> 01:03:05,640
How are we last place?

1548
01:03:05,780 --> 01:03:06,720
We should stick together.

1549
01:03:07,060 --> 01:03:08,900
We didn't get points for the...

1550
01:03:08,900 --> 01:03:10,980
Red team beat us by like...

1551
01:03:10,980 --> 01:03:12,980
Demi, lock in bro, what are you doing?

1552
01:03:12,980 --> 01:03:14,000
Shut the fuck up, Heavenly!

1553
01:03:15,900 --> 01:03:18,000
Shut the fuck up!

1554
01:03:27,480 --> 01:03:33,100
We have a lot of room to work with though for points.

1555
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:34,100
Which is good.

1556
01:03:34,840 --> 01:03:36,780
I am on... Oh, 17!

1557
01:03:37,140 --> 01:03:39,080
Holy shit, that's my placing.

1558
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:41,240
Damn.

1559
01:03:42,660 --> 01:03:44,900
Look at Lynex, she's looking so beautiful and juicy.

1560
01:03:45,040 --> 01:03:45,820
What the fuck?

1561
01:03:46,080 --> 01:03:46,940
Oh my god.

1562
01:03:49,340 --> 01:03:51,780
I love your white stuff.

1563
01:03:53,020 --> 01:03:54,700
That's my hair, dumbass.

1564
01:03:55,620 --> 01:03:56,660
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

1565
01:03:57,380 --> 01:03:57,760
Blue.

1566
01:03:58,780 --> 01:04:00,660
I'm so intubated today.

1567
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:04,920
I'm kind of sad that we don't have fucking like...

1568
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:05,700
Luigi nose, man.

1569
01:04:05,700 --> 01:04:08,040
I'm so intubated.

1570
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:14,100
When I don't know a majority of people, I'm just so...

1571
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:15,440
Interaction is hard.

1572
01:04:19,340 --> 01:04:20,940
Interaction is hard.

1573
01:04:23,120 --> 01:04:24,800
Why are you spitting the cookie?

1574
01:04:24,920 --> 01:04:26,740
It's situational.

1575
01:04:27,060 --> 01:04:29,200
Wait, why are you spitting the cookie?

1576
01:04:29,560 --> 01:04:30,800
I'm really nervous.

1577
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:32,600
This has to be some form of autism.

1578
01:04:32,920 --> 01:04:33,400
Hello?

1579
01:04:34,280 --> 01:04:35,720
No, you're right.

1580
01:04:36,820 --> 01:04:44,000
Because when I form collabs myself, like when I invite people to collabs and stuff, I know most of the people.

1581
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:47,420
So like, I make sure I have people I know.

1582
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:56,500
And so like, when I organize the collabs, the introversion doesn't hit as high.

1583
01:04:57,040 --> 01:05:00,900
But like, it hits really hard for me when I don't know the people.

1584
01:05:01,300 --> 01:05:03,030
I'm just like, I don't know.

1585
01:05:04,640 --> 01:05:05,060
I don't know.

1586
01:05:05,060 --> 01:05:09,480
I don't know how the personalities are like.

1587
01:05:11,040 --> 01:05:11,880
Alright, fuck it, bro.

1588
01:05:12,060 --> 01:05:13,580
Where are we going?

1589
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:16,280
It seems to be that people are...

1590
01:05:16,280 --> 01:05:16,880
Oh, nevermind.

1591
01:05:17,100 --> 01:05:20,160
I'm so scared.

1592
01:05:20,520 --> 01:05:21,400
Okay, let's go for a tracking.

1593
01:05:23,220 --> 01:05:26,620
Yeah, everyone seems to know each other already and I'm just like...

1594
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:32,140
I'll get you.

1595
01:05:32,200 --> 01:05:34,940
I'm so sorry, I may or may not have been the one to like, do this.

1596
01:05:35,380 --> 01:05:39,100
Some people don't respect the sacred art of shifting here in fucking like...

1597
01:05:39,740 --> 01:05:41,780
I'm shifting in front of them, they don't shit a shit.

1598
01:05:41,820 --> 01:05:42,360
What is this?

1599
01:05:42,740 --> 01:05:44,960
We played this last time.

1600
01:05:45,300 --> 01:05:46,900
Oh, this is party games, okay.

1601
01:05:47,740 --> 01:05:49,160
Are these exact...

1602
01:05:49,740 --> 01:05:54,060
Yes, this is Deathmatch, then there's Splatoon.

1603
01:05:55,480 --> 01:05:56,280
It's a camera.

1604
01:05:58,500 --> 01:05:59,640
This is Splatoon.

1605
01:05:59,640 --> 01:06:02,820
So it's the exact same as the last Block Wars.

1606
01:06:03,320 --> 01:06:04,700
Oh, okay, so I don't have to learn.

1607
01:06:04,760 --> 01:06:06,080
Guys, I've never watched the Block Wars.

1608
01:06:07,260 --> 01:06:07,720
Whoa!

1609
01:06:09,860 --> 01:06:10,320
Whoa!

1610
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:12,620
I'm sorry, I stuttered.

1611
01:06:12,940 --> 01:06:15,900
Dude, I'm so serious, but I don't understand the game, though.

1612
01:06:16,060 --> 01:06:18,820
Not a single competitive bone in that fucking show.

1613
01:06:19,160 --> 01:06:20,980
I haven't watched the last Block Wars.

1614
01:06:21,300 --> 01:06:22,940
I will explain, don't worry.

1615
01:06:23,040 --> 01:06:24,300
This is like Fall Guys.

1616
01:06:24,300 --> 01:06:26,680
The name Go Down is how you play the game.

1617
01:06:26,780 --> 01:06:29,920
So you can sabotage other people, too, by knocking them off.

1618
01:06:30,280 --> 01:06:31,520
Can you get fall damage?

1619
01:06:32,020 --> 01:06:34,500
Yes, you have to get all the way to the end.

1620
01:06:34,500 --> 01:06:35,680
You can get punched, by the way, so careful of that.

1621
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:38,100
And you don't get points unless you make it to the end.

1622
01:06:38,420 --> 01:06:39,560
So you have to get points.

1623
01:06:39,580 --> 01:06:39,600
Really?

1624
01:06:43,140 --> 01:06:45,620
People can sabotage you, so you have to stay away.

1625
01:06:46,980 --> 01:06:47,680
Oh, sorry.

1626
01:06:48,220 --> 01:06:52,340
What you do is you fall down, you get points for going all the way to the bottom.

1627
01:06:52,340 --> 01:06:53,580
You don't want to die.

1628
01:06:53,580 --> 01:06:55,280
You don't get points if you die early.

1629
01:06:55,680 --> 01:06:57,720
Even though you went really far.

1630
01:06:57,880 --> 01:06:58,980
Yep, yep, yep.

1631
01:06:59,020 --> 01:07:00,860
Oh my god, I'm going to die.

1632
01:07:01,800 --> 01:07:02,060
Careful.

1633
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:08,520
Also, when you hit somebody off...

1634
01:07:09,040 --> 01:07:11,980
The fireworks are people actually dying right now.

1635
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:12,700
Son of a bitch, I died!

1636
01:07:14,900 --> 01:07:18,100
Also, if you knock somebody off, you can get points from it.

1637
01:07:18,500 --> 01:07:20,400
Boosper fucking killed me!

1638
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:22,400
I was literally so locked in!

1639
01:07:23,860 --> 01:07:24,580
Target that guy.

1640
01:07:24,800 --> 01:07:25,560
Yeah, target that guy.

1641
01:07:25,780 --> 01:07:26,740
Target that fucker, man.

1642
01:07:26,800 --> 01:07:27,140
What the fuck?

1643
01:07:27,640 --> 01:07:28,520
Highkey, get his ass.

1644
01:07:30,300 --> 01:07:31,640
He's Norwegian, I don't like those people.

1645
01:07:32,080 --> 01:07:32,880
Ooh, what do you do?

1646
01:07:33,940 --> 01:07:34,600
Wait, they're real?

1647
01:07:34,740 --> 01:07:34,860
Huh?

1648
01:07:35,420 --> 01:07:35,860
I'm Norwegian.

1649
01:07:36,740 --> 01:07:37,060
Damn.

1650
01:07:40,200 --> 01:07:40,940
He's my people!

1651
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:43,660
And there can only be one of us.

1652
01:07:44,240 --> 01:07:45,380
Now when I say that, I get in trouble.

1653
01:07:47,120 --> 01:07:47,940
Oh my god, bro!

1654
01:07:47,940 --> 01:07:48,720
Oh, it's glass.

1655
01:07:48,900 --> 01:07:51,340
I just stabbed myself a little bit there.

1656
01:07:52,580 --> 01:07:54,440
Now when I say that, it's a problem, huh?

1657
01:07:55,560 --> 01:07:55,740
Yeah.

1658
01:08:01,320 --> 01:08:05,700
When people are tryharding, I'm literally just chasing them and fighting them.

1659
01:08:06,840 --> 01:08:11,000
Bro, every time I fall, I literally lean into the screen.

1660
01:08:11,380 --> 01:08:12,540
It's so fucking funny!

1661
01:08:13,140 --> 01:08:13,680
No, I died!

1662
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:15,960
I thought I had enough HP.

1663
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:18,840
I'm like fucking sword out of line and shit.

1664
01:08:19,120 --> 01:08:21,360
You get points from knocking people off, too.

1665
01:08:21,380 --> 01:08:22,380
I die from being stupid.

1666
01:08:23,620 --> 01:08:24,100
Unfortunate.

1667
01:08:25,400 --> 01:08:27,100
This pig will carry me!

1668
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:30,620
Oh, yeah, the pig takes a damage from...

1669
01:08:30,620 --> 01:08:33,920
Oh, it just fucking died from that.

1670
01:08:33,980 --> 01:08:35,140
I thought that was gonna save my ass.

1671
01:08:35,760 --> 01:08:37,220
Michi, get the fuck away!

1672
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:38,380
No, bitch!

1673
01:08:38,720 --> 01:08:38,940
No!

1674
01:08:38,940 --> 01:08:40,940
Oh, fuck!

1675
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:43,740
Oh, fuck!

1676
01:08:45,740 --> 01:08:46,240
I'm dying!

1677
01:08:46,240 --> 01:08:46,800
Where am I?

1678
01:08:47,680 --> 01:08:48,980
I heal, I heal, I heal.

1679
01:08:50,940 --> 01:08:51,940
I see where I am.

1680
01:08:51,940 --> 01:08:54,160
The game is about to end in 30 seconds, guys.

1681
01:08:54,740 --> 01:08:55,040
No!

1682
01:08:55,240 --> 01:08:57,460
Do you only get points if you make it to the end?

1683
01:08:57,800 --> 01:08:59,400
Yeah, and also you kill people, too.

1684
01:09:00,100 --> 01:09:02,500
Wait, why are the checkpoints like that?

1685
01:09:02,580 --> 01:09:04,060
The glass.

1686
01:09:05,760 --> 01:09:07,060
We made it that far, Hucka?

1687
01:09:07,500 --> 01:09:09,360
Bro, whoever fucking punched me, their mom's a hoe.

1688
01:09:09,360 --> 01:09:10,060
Why are you like a noob?

1689
01:09:10,740 --> 01:09:11,620
I'm a noob, bro.

1690
01:09:11,700 --> 01:09:12,080
I'm sorry.

1691
01:09:12,160 --> 01:09:13,660
I'm almost at the end, guys!

1692
01:09:13,700 --> 01:09:14,760
Please, extend the timer!

1693
01:09:15,160 --> 01:09:17,060
Bro, who is punching Boosfer?

1694
01:09:18,360 --> 01:09:18,720
Man!

1695
01:09:19,420 --> 01:09:20,080
This guy's a hater.

1696
01:09:20,680 --> 01:09:21,720
Yeah, we're gonna kill Boosfer, man.

1697
01:09:21,740 --> 01:09:23,840
His teammates might be talking shit.

1698
01:09:23,940 --> 01:09:24,500
You never know, man.

1699
01:09:24,660 --> 01:09:26,160
Yeah, bro, what the fuck, man?

1700
01:09:27,320 --> 01:09:28,160
Alright, I did small.

1701
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:29,120
That was that.

1702
01:09:29,980 --> 01:09:32,640
Hey, we got third in this round.

1703
01:09:33,180 --> 01:09:33,780
Oh, hell yeah.

1704
01:09:33,820 --> 01:09:34,860
I killed so many people.

1705
01:09:34,860 --> 01:09:36,640
I'm focused, bro.

1706
01:09:37,360 --> 01:09:39,420
You might be number one in kills.

1707
01:09:39,860 --> 01:09:41,480
Kills are worth, like, one point.

1708
01:09:41,740 --> 01:09:42,180
Oh, shit.

1709
01:09:42,700 --> 01:09:44,960
Wait, kills are worth one point?

1710
01:09:45,140 --> 01:09:46,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1711
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:49,100
I was trying to say you out, but I was muted.

1712
01:09:49,660 --> 01:09:50,940
I was also muted.

1713
01:09:51,040 --> 01:09:51,600
I fucked up.

1714
01:09:51,700 --> 01:09:53,420
Yeah, yeah, I was killing people, too.

1715
01:09:53,560 --> 01:09:54,500
I was chasing people.

1716
01:09:55,640 --> 01:09:57,560
The kills are worth, like, one point.

1717
01:09:57,780 --> 01:09:58,860
So, it's not a big deal.

1718
01:09:59,840 --> 01:10:00,280
Goddamn.

1719
01:10:00,440 --> 01:10:02,380
You guys know Payday?

1720
01:10:02,380 --> 01:10:03,660
Uh-huh.

1721
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:05,660
Yeah, Payday.

1722
01:10:05,700 --> 01:10:06,480
This is Payday.

1723
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:07,600
We are robbing a bank.

1724
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:08,720
There are gonna be wars.

1725
01:10:09,980 --> 01:10:11,340
Wolfie, can I rob your heart?

1726
01:10:11,900 --> 01:10:13,300
I can't stop muting myself.

1727
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:15,660
I'm so locked in.

1728
01:10:16,040 --> 01:10:17,500
I'm so locked in.

1729
01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:21,120
It's cause, like, when a lot of people are talking, I feel bad talking.

1730
01:10:21,980 --> 01:10:23,560
Cause then it's like...

1731
01:10:23,560 --> 01:10:24,720
I feel like I'm...

1732
01:10:24,720 --> 01:10:28,460
I'm, like, adding more noise.

1733
01:10:29,700 --> 01:10:32,320
So I'm just trying to, like, interject when I can.

1734
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:36,120
The higher you go in the map, the more, like, high-value loot there is.

1735
01:10:36,220 --> 01:10:38,280
And the more loot you're carrying, the slower you become.

1736
01:10:39,020 --> 01:10:39,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1737
01:10:40,040 --> 01:10:43,220
If you die, you lose half of your loot.

1738
01:10:47,780 --> 01:10:50,500
Dude, I'm, like, jamming to this fucking music.

1739
01:10:50,680 --> 01:10:51,740
This shit's so good.

1740
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:54,880
It's so good.

1741
01:10:55,520 --> 01:10:56,500
Just calm with this shit.

1742
01:10:56,700 --> 01:10:57,620
Oh, fuck.

1743
01:10:58,480 --> 01:10:59,840
I can't fucking jump.

1744
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:00,640
Fuck this shit.

1745
01:11:01,960 --> 01:11:03,260
Oh, no swearing, please.

1746
01:11:03,640 --> 01:11:04,500
Yeah, what the fuck?

1747
01:11:05,260 --> 01:11:06,260
Uh, yeah, what the...

1748
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:07,140
What the freak?

1749
01:11:09,280 --> 01:11:10,080
Yeah, yeah.

1750
01:11:10,720 --> 01:11:11,780
I've got lots of loot.

1751
01:11:11,880 --> 01:11:13,080
I'm gonna bank it now.

1752
01:11:13,860 --> 01:11:14,100
Oh, yeah.

1753
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:16,320
Don't really play too risky, by the way.

1754
01:11:16,340 --> 01:11:17,420
Cause that's what I did last time.

1755
01:11:17,580 --> 01:11:19,400
Yeah, and then he lost half of his loot.

1756
01:11:20,280 --> 01:11:22,640
There's, like, exits on the walls.

1757
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:23,780
Like, exit signs.

1758
01:11:25,280 --> 01:11:26,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1759
01:11:26,080 --> 01:11:27,140
Just follow the exit sign.

1760
01:11:30,080 --> 01:11:30,800
Locked in.

1761
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:32,540
I got a lot of gold.

1762
01:11:33,740 --> 01:11:36,160
And you just go to the truck to deposit.

1763
01:11:38,100 --> 01:11:38,340
Thank you.

1764
01:11:39,200 --> 01:11:40,700
Just follow the exit signs.

1765
01:11:40,820 --> 01:11:41,760
Just follow the exit signs.

1766
01:11:42,280 --> 01:11:43,200
I can't read!

1767
01:11:44,680 --> 01:11:45,820
There's no text.

1768
01:11:46,280 --> 01:11:47,000
It's just the guy.

1769
01:11:47,200 --> 01:11:47,800
It's just symbols.

1770
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:49,800
Wait, do you just touch the truck?

1771
01:11:49,900 --> 01:11:50,360
How do you do this?

1772
01:11:50,780 --> 01:11:51,540
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1773
01:11:51,540 --> 01:11:52,440
You gotta go inside it.

1774
01:11:52,520 --> 01:11:54,180
Oh, I think... Wait, do we just go inside it?

1775
01:11:54,240 --> 01:11:54,720
Okay, shit, nice.

1776
01:11:54,720 --> 01:11:57,180
Just go inside, and then it'll auto-deposit.

1777
01:11:59,420 --> 01:12:00,100
Holy shit!

1778
01:12:00,180 --> 01:12:03,040
There's one guy, and I got 20 fucking minions!

1779
01:12:03,340 --> 01:12:03,760
What's happening?

1780
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:06,460
You're just gonna block...

1781
01:12:06,460 --> 01:12:09,260
My iPhone is, like, blocking my screen.

1782
01:12:10,140 --> 01:12:11,440
Oh, okay.

1783
01:12:11,920 --> 01:12:13,520
Why do you have your iPhone so, like, high up?

1784
01:12:14,260 --> 01:12:15,300
VTuber struggle, bro.

1785
01:12:15,620 --> 01:12:15,900
Yeah.

1786
01:12:18,300 --> 01:12:18,940
Thank God.

1787
01:12:19,100 --> 01:12:22,560
I'm, like, next to a guy, and he's aggroing everybody, so they're all hitting him instead of me.

1788
01:12:24,040 --> 01:12:25,300
Oh, I see that right now.

1789
01:12:26,120 --> 01:12:26,760
Uh-oh.

1790
01:12:28,220 --> 01:12:28,860
Son of a bitch.

1791
01:12:29,080 --> 01:12:29,360
I can't.

1792
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:33,020
This FOV is so, like, hard to, like, tell, like, how far you guys are.

1793
01:12:33,540 --> 01:12:33,540
Yeah.

1794
01:12:34,180 --> 01:12:35,800
Coming back with points.

1795
01:12:36,360 --> 01:12:37,000
I have points, too.

1796
01:12:38,340 --> 01:12:39,180
That's good, that's good.

1797
01:12:39,280 --> 01:12:40,060
That's a lot.

1798
01:12:41,160 --> 01:12:42,500
Hey, hey, stay away, scarecrow!

1799
01:12:43,800 --> 01:12:45,040
I got 100.

1800
01:12:45,220 --> 01:12:46,040
I'm on my way.

1801
01:12:46,180 --> 01:12:47,440
I'm heading back now.

1802
01:12:47,440 --> 01:12:48,500
I'm on my way, guys.

1803
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:49,540
I'm following the exit.

1804
01:12:52,480 --> 01:12:53,400
Okay, cool.

1805
01:12:53,620 --> 01:12:54,400
How much time we got?

1806
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:55,960
Uh, 40 seconds.

1807
01:12:56,020 --> 01:12:58,140
30 seconds, so you should head to the exit if you can.

1808
01:12:58,200 --> 01:13:00,460
If you're deep in the area, head to the exit.

1809
01:13:01,240 --> 01:13:01,540
Yeah.

1810
01:13:01,880 --> 01:13:03,300
Oh, fuck.

1811
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:04,700
30 seconds.

1812
01:13:06,900 --> 01:13:07,880
I placed more.

1813
01:13:09,080 --> 01:13:09,960
Stay away, stay away, stay away.

1814
01:13:09,960 --> 01:13:11,460
I'm coming, I'm coming back.

1815
01:13:11,980 --> 01:13:18,400
Yeah, you only have, like, 20 seconds to gather stuff, and then you have an extra, like, 15 or 30 to, like, go back.

1816
01:13:19,940 --> 01:13:21,280
Oh, fuck, oh, fuck, oh, fuck.

1817
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:24,040
I'm getting so heavy.

1818
01:13:24,320 --> 01:13:25,420
The exit's outside.

1819
01:13:25,900 --> 01:13:26,480
Thanks, Wolfie.

1820
01:13:27,400 --> 01:13:28,340
I'm heading over now.

1821
01:13:29,340 --> 01:13:32,100
How many seconds to, uh...

1822
01:13:32,100 --> 01:13:32,900
You have to go back now.

1823
01:13:35,020 --> 01:13:38,780
Okay, I'm gonna follow the green across the map to go out.

1824
01:13:39,320 --> 01:13:40,620
The green, like, path.

1825
01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:43,200
There's green, like, signs.

1826
01:13:43,200 --> 01:13:44,940
Dude, there's someone with, like, 40 mobs on them.

1827
01:13:45,020 --> 01:13:45,620
That's crazy.

1828
01:13:46,520 --> 01:13:47,820
Oh, god.

1829
01:13:48,040 --> 01:13:48,740
There's so many.

1830
01:13:49,080 --> 01:13:49,920
Holy shit.

1831
01:13:50,220 --> 01:13:51,500
I'm not gonna make it.

1832
01:13:51,860 --> 01:13:52,280
That's it.

1833
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:54,780
10 seconds, 10 seconds!

1834
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:56,120
Run!

1835
01:13:56,600 --> 01:13:58,280
Bro, I literally couldn't pick shit up.

1836
01:13:58,460 --> 01:13:59,240
It's so crowded.

1837
01:13:59,240 --> 01:14:00,500
I have 80 points.

1838
01:14:01,820 --> 01:14:02,340
Run!

1839
01:14:03,900 --> 01:14:04,680
That's crazy.

1840
01:14:04,680 --> 01:14:06,180
We're still doing good, guys.

1841
01:14:07,440 --> 01:14:08,500
We're still doing good.

1842
01:14:08,560 --> 01:14:09,100
We're still doing good.

1843
01:14:10,260 --> 01:14:12,280
Nothing to worry about.

1844
01:14:12,500 --> 01:14:14,440
Damn, look at Dunkey!

1845
01:14:15,100 --> 01:14:15,560
Holy shit.

1846
01:14:16,400 --> 01:14:17,180
I was farming.

1847
01:14:19,060 --> 01:14:20,080
I'm a bit of a thief.

1848
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:21,360
Crazy.

1849
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:23,300
Damn.

1850
01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:24,320
Yeah,

1851
01:14:28,420 --> 01:14:29,260
I shoplift lately.

1852
01:14:30,420 --> 01:14:31,140
Yeah, I shoplift lately.

1853
01:14:31,140 --> 01:14:33,020
I got sponsored by Payday, like, this week.

1854
01:14:33,020 --> 01:14:33,380
Oh.

1855
01:14:34,540 --> 01:14:36,040
Oh, my god.

1856
01:14:36,680 --> 01:14:37,960
Okay, Splatoon time.

1857
01:14:39,040 --> 01:14:41,600
If you kill people, you get points.

1858
01:14:43,020 --> 01:14:44,240
There's kill points.

1859
01:14:44,540 --> 01:14:46,880
You want to cover the map to reload.

1860
01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:47,260
How do you kill somebody?

1861
01:14:47,920 --> 01:14:48,780
You just shoot them.

1862
01:14:49,020 --> 01:14:49,860
It's like Splatoon.

1863
01:14:50,940 --> 01:14:54,360
To reload your gun, you have to shift on top of your color.

1864
01:14:54,540 --> 01:14:55,420
So that would be lime.

1865
01:14:55,760 --> 01:14:57,160
And then you become a part of it.

1866
01:14:57,260 --> 01:14:58,380
You become a part of the color.

1867
01:14:58,600 --> 01:15:00,020
You and the color become one.

1868
01:15:00,420 --> 01:15:02,700
Oh, you can actually see the leaderboards now.

1869
01:15:02,780 --> 01:15:04,540
Because last time you guys fucking hit that shit.

1870
01:15:05,020 --> 01:15:06,260
It's because it was the last game.

1871
01:15:06,680 --> 01:15:08,600
Oh, the last game you hide it?

1872
01:15:09,060 --> 01:15:09,560
Mm-hmm.

1873
01:15:09,680 --> 01:15:11,320
Oh, I thought it was just for...

1874
01:15:12,380 --> 01:15:13,620
specifically just that.

1875
01:15:13,900 --> 01:15:16,080
Just because we didn't want to show you the points.

1876
01:15:16,220 --> 01:15:16,320
Yep.

1877
01:15:20,080 --> 01:15:21,180
That's where I killed Vinny.

1878
01:15:22,780 --> 01:15:23,560
Oh, hold up.

1879
01:15:23,700 --> 01:15:24,140
Boost for alert.

1880
01:15:27,160 --> 01:15:28,540
Oh, I'm going to die.

1881
01:15:28,560 --> 01:15:30,340
Oh, this guy is an actual Minecraft player.

1882
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:31,180
Noob.

1883
01:15:31,540 --> 01:15:32,320
What the fuck?

1884
01:15:33,040 --> 01:15:33,660
Noob.

1885
01:15:34,060 --> 01:15:36,320
No, he's an actual Minecraft player.

1886
01:15:37,980 --> 01:15:40,640
I was trying to bully non-Minecraft players.

1887
01:15:41,780 --> 01:15:42,320
No!

1888
01:15:44,020 --> 01:15:45,820
Oh, I killed someone.

1889
01:15:49,020 --> 01:15:49,500
Who it is?

1890
01:15:50,120 --> 01:15:50,740
RabScarecrow?

1891
01:15:50,920 --> 01:15:51,820
More like...

1892
01:15:51,820 --> 01:15:52,200
Goodbye.

1893
01:15:55,760 --> 01:15:56,340
So, wait.

1894
01:15:56,380 --> 01:15:57,760
Do we get points for like territory card?

1895
01:15:58,140 --> 01:15:58,780
Yeah, we do.

1896
01:15:59,280 --> 01:15:59,540
Oh, shit.

1897
01:15:59,600 --> 01:15:59,780
Nice.

1898
01:15:59,860 --> 01:15:59,940
Okay.

1899
01:16:00,320 --> 01:16:04,360
It counts like every like minute or so.

1900
01:16:04,580 --> 01:16:05,020
I got killed.

1901
01:16:05,200 --> 01:16:05,420
Fuck.

1902
01:16:06,200 --> 01:16:06,920
All good.

1903
01:16:07,560 --> 01:16:08,480
I keep dying.

1904
01:16:08,580 --> 01:16:09,240
I'm so sorry.

1905
01:16:09,480 --> 01:16:09,980
It's okay.

1906
01:16:10,740 --> 01:16:11,280
It's fun.

1907
01:16:11,920 --> 01:16:12,640
Oh, no.

1908
01:16:12,940 --> 01:16:13,460
I couldn't.

1909
01:16:13,560 --> 01:16:14,540
I got points spawned.

1910
01:16:14,560 --> 01:16:15,160
Got covered up.

1911
01:16:15,880 --> 01:16:16,440
This is fucked up.

1912
01:16:16,460 --> 01:16:18,840
This is so fucked up.

1913
01:16:18,840 --> 01:16:19,560
This is crazy.

1914
01:16:21,380 --> 01:16:21,780
No!

1915
01:16:22,840 --> 01:16:23,680
Trying to cover.

1916
01:16:24,520 --> 01:16:27,380
I should actually like target people and not just fucking pains.

1917
01:16:27,520 --> 01:16:29,180
I should do both at the same time.

1918
01:16:31,400 --> 01:16:31,560
Right.

1919
01:16:31,660 --> 01:16:33,120
Die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die.

1920
01:16:34,120 --> 01:16:35,100
Oh, get fucked.

1921
01:16:35,280 --> 01:16:35,620
Oh, fuck.

1922
01:16:35,720 --> 01:16:36,080
I died.

1923
01:16:36,940 --> 01:16:37,540
Oh, shit.

1924
01:16:37,700 --> 01:16:38,400
Someone spawned behind...

1925
01:16:38,400 --> 01:16:38,900
JoeBart.

1926
01:16:39,080 --> 01:16:39,640
Fuck you, man.

1927
01:16:42,160 --> 01:16:45,220
We are the non-Minecraft players.

1928
01:16:45,380 --> 01:16:46,240
Oh, fuck you, Joe.

1929
01:16:46,240 --> 01:16:46,920
Oh, fuck you, Joe!

1930
01:16:48,620 --> 01:16:49,960
Guys, spill it, spill it!

1931
01:16:52,560 --> 01:16:54,740
No, you're a natural Minecraft player!

1932
01:16:58,280 --> 01:17:00,000
We have 43 seconds left.

1933
01:17:01,060 --> 01:17:02,360
Oh, I killed Shirahiko, okay.

1934
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:04,560
I died again, fuck.

1935
01:17:05,020 --> 01:17:05,540
Fuck, okay.

1936
01:17:08,140 --> 01:17:08,620
No!

1937
01:17:09,140 --> 01:17:10,680
I'm, like, being followed.

1938
01:17:12,660 --> 01:17:13,620
Ah, fuck.

1939
01:17:14,600 --> 01:17:15,040
Huge.

1940
01:17:17,680 --> 01:17:18,680
I'm just trickshotting people.

1941
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:19,240
I think we should cover more.

1942
01:17:20,600 --> 01:17:23,560
Yeah, we should focus on covering right now.

1943
01:17:26,500 --> 01:17:27,620
Whoever shot me, your mom's a hoe!

1944
01:17:28,260 --> 01:17:28,800
Oh, what?

1945
01:17:28,920 --> 01:17:30,160
Oh, there's guys behind me!

1946
01:17:31,860 --> 01:17:32,300
Fuck.

1947
01:17:32,360 --> 01:17:33,620
He got...

1948
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:35,080
Pranked!

1949
01:17:35,480 --> 01:17:36,320
Oh, my God.

1950
01:17:36,840 --> 01:17:37,200
No!

1951
01:17:38,900 --> 01:17:40,440
This is literally Splatoon, yeah.

1952
01:17:42,060 --> 01:17:43,440
Alright, we did alright.

1953
01:17:44,540 --> 01:17:45,660
I killed five people.

1954
01:17:46,740 --> 01:17:47,180
Yay!

1955
01:17:48,820 --> 01:17:50,680
Oh, the points are, like, super close.

1956
01:17:50,760 --> 01:17:50,940
Okay.

1957
01:17:51,440 --> 01:17:52,840
Now it's deathmatch time.

1958
01:17:53,060 --> 01:17:56,040
Oh, we have so low points...

1959
01:17:56,040 --> 01:17:59,360
Is it because of, like, the first game?

1960
01:18:00,240 --> 01:18:04,040
No, no, no, that's just because we probably didn't shoot too much area, which is alright.

1961
01:18:04,380 --> 01:18:07,640
It could also be because people, like, cover our area, which is, like, unlucky.

1962
01:18:08,940 --> 01:18:09,800
Hold on.

1963
01:18:10,240 --> 01:18:10,800
Alright.

1964
01:18:11,140 --> 01:18:13,300
This is deathmatch.

1965
01:18:13,920 --> 01:18:15,580
Like, Valorant deathmatch.

1966
01:18:15,940 --> 01:18:16,920
Or CS, or whatever.

1967
01:18:17,640 --> 01:18:19,240
I don't remember this.

1968
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:21,120
Oh, this is...

1969
01:18:21,400 --> 01:18:21,920
One shot.

1970
01:18:23,960 --> 01:18:24,760
Oh, God.

1971
01:18:25,360 --> 01:18:26,720
Oh, I love this one.

1972
01:18:27,260 --> 01:18:28,780
Oh, so the spawn's fucking stupid.

1973
01:18:28,960 --> 01:18:30,040
You literally spawn camp.

1974
01:18:30,120 --> 01:18:32,220
If you spawn that area, they're all gonna spawn that area, too.

1975
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:33,200
Oh!

1976
01:18:33,760 --> 01:18:34,500
I found that out.

1977
01:18:34,500 --> 01:18:35,700
You right-click, right?

1978
01:18:37,140 --> 01:18:37,600
Yeah.

1979
01:18:38,180 --> 01:18:39,880
It auto-recharges for you, as well.

1980
01:18:40,280 --> 01:18:41,100
Oh, really?

1981
01:18:42,980 --> 01:18:44,860
Why don't you, I think, crash?

1982
01:18:45,340 --> 01:18:45,960
So, we're waiting.

1983
01:18:46,360 --> 01:18:46,780
Oh, okay.

1984
01:18:48,280 --> 01:18:49,100
Now, good.

1985
01:18:49,460 --> 01:18:52,100
That's a drinking water moment.

1986
01:18:53,260 --> 01:18:54,340
It's right-click, right?

1987
01:18:54,700 --> 01:18:55,480
Is it right-click?

1988
01:18:55,580 --> 01:18:57,780
Oh, guys, we're above, like, red team.

1989
01:18:57,920 --> 01:18:59,700
Like, so far ahead from red team.

1990
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:01,540
That's good.

1991
01:19:02,580 --> 01:19:03,540
That's the opposition.

1992
01:19:05,280 --> 01:19:05,720
Okay.

1993
01:19:05,940 --> 01:19:07,660
All we have to do is...

1994
01:19:08,720 --> 01:19:09,660
You just spawn camp.

1995
01:19:09,900 --> 01:19:11,700
That's the strat.

1996
01:19:12,300 --> 01:19:12,620
Yeah.

1997
01:19:13,700 --> 01:19:14,820
They all spawn in it.

1998
01:19:15,020 --> 01:19:17,580
It's, like, designated spawns every time.

1999
01:19:17,660 --> 01:19:18,160
It's not randomized.

2000
01:19:19,580 --> 01:19:22,040
Which is what I found out in the last, like, minute.

2001
01:19:23,380 --> 01:19:23,640
Okay.

2002
01:19:23,740 --> 01:19:24,500
I'm so bad, guys.

2003
01:19:25,120 --> 01:19:25,420
Let's go.

2004
01:19:26,940 --> 01:19:29,080
My PC blew the screen.

2005
01:19:29,080 --> 01:19:29,400
Oh!

2006
01:19:30,180 --> 01:19:31,960
You're, like, lagging a little, too.

2007
01:19:32,620 --> 01:19:32,920
Yeah.

2008
01:19:35,860 --> 01:19:36,340
Uh...

2009
01:19:36,340 --> 01:19:38,640
If this happens again, I might...

2010
01:19:38,640 --> 01:19:40,000
Might be my 13th reason.

2011
01:19:40,820 --> 01:19:41,260
Oh, hell no.

2012
01:19:42,420 --> 01:19:43,980
What were the other 12?

2013
01:19:44,240 --> 01:19:44,680
I'm kidding!

2014
01:19:44,960 --> 01:19:45,820
What were the other 12?

2015
01:19:45,980 --> 01:19:46,900
Like, who was it?

2016
01:19:47,560 --> 01:19:48,040
Axis.

2017
01:19:49,760 --> 01:19:51,060
Call them out.

2018
01:19:52,940 --> 01:19:54,560
Alright, guys.

2019
01:19:54,640 --> 01:19:55,320
Start fragging out.

2020
01:19:55,320 --> 01:19:57,160
Oh my god, where are they spawning?

2021
01:19:57,280 --> 01:19:58,000
It's time to lock in.

2022
01:19:59,260 --> 01:19:59,580
Yeah.

2023
01:20:01,540 --> 01:20:02,860
There's, like, nobody here.

2024
01:20:03,400 --> 01:20:03,540
Where?

2025
01:20:05,620 --> 01:20:05,940
Where?

2026
01:20:07,560 --> 01:20:08,300
Boost for alert.

2027
01:20:09,640 --> 01:20:10,540
I'm gonna get shot in the back.

2028
01:20:10,620 --> 01:20:11,420
I can feel it.

2029
01:20:11,780 --> 01:20:12,760
Oh, come on, man.

2030
01:20:12,900 --> 01:20:14,100
As you said that, I got shot in the back.

2031
01:20:16,860 --> 01:20:17,180
No!

2032
01:20:21,240 --> 01:20:22,260
This is Demi's game.

2033
01:20:22,360 --> 01:20:22,660
Lock in.

2034
01:20:26,060 --> 01:20:29,980
Bro, there's no reason for you to fucking dodge.

2035
01:20:30,760 --> 01:20:32,300
It's all about time.

2036
01:20:36,980 --> 01:20:38,060
That's what I'm saying.

2037
01:20:38,200 --> 01:20:39,340
You know where the spawns are?

2038
01:20:39,480 --> 01:20:40,740
Just fucking stay there.

2039
01:20:41,440 --> 01:20:42,380
Holy shit, okay.

2040
01:20:44,140 --> 01:20:45,400
But I feel like...

2041
01:20:45,400 --> 01:20:46,420
The spawn...

2042
01:20:46,420 --> 01:20:48,640
The spawn rate lowered.

2043
01:20:49,420 --> 01:20:51,320
It's not as bad as last time.

2044
01:20:55,700 --> 01:20:56,460
Oh, it's Demi.

2045
01:20:56,500 --> 01:20:59,220
I wanna go back to farming, bro.

2046
01:21:00,060 --> 01:21:00,940
Where did you get shot?

2047
01:21:02,140 --> 01:21:02,580
No!

2048
01:21:03,900 --> 01:21:05,660
Oh my god, where was that?

2049
01:21:06,160 --> 01:21:07,820
Dude, Hakka, when you retire, you should open a farm.

2050
01:21:08,280 --> 01:21:09,500
Yeah, that's a dream.

2051
01:21:09,920 --> 01:21:12,000
No, behind me, of course.

2052
01:21:15,440 --> 01:21:16,920
They both start with an F.

2053
01:21:17,940 --> 01:21:18,680
True, actually.

2054
01:21:18,920 --> 01:21:19,800
Oh, I killed Grimmy.

2055
01:21:21,680 --> 01:21:22,380
Oh my god.

2056
01:21:22,380 --> 01:21:24,600
I didn't even get shot first.

2057
01:21:26,400 --> 01:21:27,660
Fuck you, Heavenly!

2058
01:21:32,280 --> 01:21:33,620
I avenged you, Demi.

2059
01:21:33,720 --> 01:21:34,540
I did this for you.

2060
01:21:34,840 --> 01:21:36,340
Thank you, I appreciate that.

2061
01:21:38,480 --> 01:21:40,760
I did this for all the pregnant men in the world.

2062
01:21:41,320 --> 01:21:41,600
Okay.

2063
01:21:42,460 --> 01:21:42,940
Amen.

2064
01:21:43,900 --> 01:21:44,960
There's gotta be a lot of those.

2065
01:21:45,520 --> 01:21:47,100
How did I die?

2066
01:21:47,100 --> 01:21:49,020
That fucking Elmo guy is crazy.

2067
01:21:49,620 --> 01:21:50,100
Hello, guys.

2068
01:21:50,860 --> 01:21:52,200
Oh, Heavenly got me again.

2069
01:21:53,660 --> 01:21:54,120
Oh god.

2070
01:21:55,300 --> 01:21:56,500
So many people here play Valorant.

2071
01:21:56,600 --> 01:21:57,740
I'm missing everything, guys!

2072
01:21:58,660 --> 01:22:00,500
What the fuck is happening?

2073
01:22:02,900 --> 01:22:04,040
Bro, people are sweating.

2074
01:22:04,340 --> 01:22:05,860
People are fucking sweating on Minecraft.

2075
01:22:06,100 --> 01:22:07,000
This is ridiculous.

2076
01:22:07,940 --> 01:22:08,340
Yeah, man.

2077
01:22:09,300 --> 01:22:09,820
Okay.

2078
01:22:10,060 --> 01:22:12,500
This game mode is super sweaty.

2079
01:22:13,860 --> 01:22:16,000
Oh, I saw her too late.

2080
01:22:16,480 --> 01:22:18,200
This is like bullying a baby, man.

2081
01:22:18,260 --> 01:22:19,380
Oh, he's low, he's low.

2082
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:21,240
Are you the baby?

2083
01:22:21,640 --> 01:22:22,540
I was gonna say, he's low.

2084
01:22:25,460 --> 01:22:26,100
He's low.

2085
01:22:26,520 --> 01:22:28,460
I mean, he's next to me.

2086
01:22:30,360 --> 01:22:31,460
Not the Among Us!

2087
01:22:33,040 --> 01:22:34,120
I got fucked by the Among Us.

2088
01:22:34,720 --> 01:22:35,460
Guys, he's 1 HP.

2089
01:22:36,720 --> 01:22:37,720
That's fine, anybody.

2090
01:22:37,960 --> 01:22:38,500
Oh, there he is.

2091
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:41,580
This guy is gonna get botted, bro.

2092
01:22:43,180 --> 01:22:44,140
No way!

2093
01:22:44,560 --> 01:22:45,260
I'm killing myself.

2094
01:22:45,660 --> 01:22:46,140
No!

2095
01:22:47,280 --> 01:22:49,080
The fucking 360!

2096
01:22:50,220 --> 01:22:52,200
Now it's just Minecraft that crashed.

2097
01:22:52,520 --> 01:22:53,760
I don't want a 1v1 fight.

2098
01:22:54,180 --> 01:22:54,860
Did you crash?

2099
01:22:56,260 --> 01:22:57,520
Yeah, my Minecraft crashed though.

2100
01:22:58,020 --> 01:22:58,800
Oh, you did it?

2101
01:22:58,960 --> 01:22:59,440
No!

2102
01:22:59,940 --> 01:23:00,540
That's unlucky.

2103
01:23:01,980 --> 01:23:03,260
Wait, your Minecraft crashed again?

2104
01:23:03,960 --> 01:23:05,760
Yeah, now it's just Minecraft, not my PC.

2105
01:23:05,760 --> 01:23:06,880
Damn.

2106
01:23:07,320 --> 01:23:12,060
Is your CPU getting overloaded or something?

2107
01:23:12,720 --> 01:23:13,820
I don't think so.

2108
01:23:13,980 --> 01:23:15,040
Jesus Christ, 29.

2109
01:23:17,080 --> 01:23:17,700
29?!

2110
01:23:17,700 --> 01:23:21,500
I was barely firing people for mine.

2111
01:23:22,260 --> 01:23:23,260
I killed 6 people.

2112
01:23:24,040 --> 01:23:25,060
I did not do good.

2113
01:23:25,720 --> 01:23:26,700
I got 12.

2114
01:23:27,040 --> 01:23:28,000
12 kills.

2115
01:23:29,420 --> 01:23:31,300
People were not spawning.

2116
01:23:32,240 --> 01:23:35,400
Yeah, there were so many times where I'm just alone.

2117
01:23:36,340 --> 01:23:36,700
Yeah.

2118
01:23:38,280 --> 01:23:38,680
Yeah.

2119
01:23:39,060 --> 01:23:41,120
I was looking for people and I just got killed in the back.

2120
01:23:41,980 --> 01:23:43,120
Why is this meat over here?

2121
01:23:44,400 --> 01:23:47,280
It tells you at the bottom left when you are...

2122
01:23:47,280 --> 01:23:48,740
Oh, we are in the right side too.

2123
01:23:50,060 --> 01:23:52,040
Wait, did your kills not count because you crashed?

2124
01:23:52,100 --> 01:23:53,340
No, I think they should.

2125
01:23:54,100 --> 01:23:55,680
I'm still in the game.

2126
01:23:56,880 --> 01:23:57,080
Yeah.

2127
01:23:58,160 --> 01:23:59,180
There we go.

2128
01:23:59,740 --> 01:23:59,900
Boom.

2129
01:24:01,480 --> 01:24:02,560
So scuffed, man.

2130
01:24:02,580 --> 01:24:03,040
Holy shit.

2131
01:24:04,360 --> 01:24:04,840
Unfortunate.

2132
01:24:05,060 --> 01:24:05,460
Unlucky.

2133
01:24:06,680 --> 01:24:07,160
Unlucky.

2134
01:24:07,520 --> 01:24:08,820
Maybe Boosfer is DDoSing you.

2135
01:24:10,520 --> 01:24:12,300
They are DDoSing you, bro.

2136
01:24:13,320 --> 01:24:14,060
Not last.

2137
01:24:14,160 --> 01:24:14,500
Let's go.

2138
01:24:14,820 --> 01:24:15,640
Dude, my enemies.

2139
01:24:15,880 --> 01:24:16,520
They fear me.

2140
01:24:18,260 --> 01:24:18,960
Guys, we are 8.

2141
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:19,480
Holy shit.

2142
01:24:20,680 --> 01:24:21,100
Are we?

2143
01:24:21,680 --> 01:24:22,580
We are 8, yeah.

2144
01:24:22,980 --> 01:24:23,700
Hold on.

2145
01:24:24,700 --> 01:24:25,540
The last one.

2146
01:24:25,600 --> 01:24:26,160
Yeah, let's go.

2147
01:24:26,160 --> 01:24:27,420
Oh, shit.

2148
01:24:27,500 --> 01:24:28,580
I'm 26.

2149
01:24:29,240 --> 01:24:30,280
I'm 26.

2150
01:24:31,220 --> 01:24:31,740
Individually.

2151
01:24:31,760 --> 01:24:33,420
We did pretty solid last game, though.

2152
01:24:34,080 --> 01:24:35,160
Demi got 18.

2153
01:24:35,440 --> 01:24:39,120
At least I'm not...

2154
01:24:39,120 --> 01:24:40,660
At least I know it's not me.

2155
01:24:40,800 --> 01:24:41,880
Hey, last game.

2156
01:24:41,980 --> 01:24:43,120
I'm looking at it right now.

2157
01:24:43,240 --> 01:24:45,540
18, Demi, 19, Reinho.

2158
01:24:46,060 --> 01:24:46,460
Noob alert.

2159
01:24:48,600 --> 01:24:49,640
Did you say Noob alert?

2160
01:24:50,100 --> 01:24:51,860
Yeah, Noob alert on Reinho.

2161
01:24:51,860 --> 01:24:53,180
Life is not Roblox.

2162
01:24:54,180 --> 01:24:55,180
Okay, so...

2163
01:24:55,180 --> 01:24:57,000
All we have to do is...

2164
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,260
You see the bottom 5 players?

2165
01:24:59,620 --> 01:25:00,140
Individually?

2166
01:25:00,740 --> 01:25:01,660
We just gotta...

2167
01:25:01,660 --> 01:25:04,700
We just gotta bully the...

2168
01:25:04,700 --> 01:25:07,760
The last 5 players here.

2169
01:25:07,880 --> 01:25:09,360
Yeah, we just gotta...

2170
01:25:09,360 --> 01:25:11,040
Except for Hakka, because he's on our team.

2171
01:25:11,420 --> 01:25:12,300
That's crazy.

2172
01:25:12,540 --> 01:25:13,880
Feinberg is like...

2173
01:25:13,880 --> 01:25:19,140
Two of the players are in the bottom 5, but Feinberg is actually single-handedly carrying this entire team.

2174
01:25:19,280 --> 01:25:20,240
For first place.

2175
01:25:20,240 --> 01:25:21,280
This guy is insane.

2176
01:25:21,420 --> 01:25:26,640
I think if we split the team properly...

2177
01:25:26,640 --> 01:25:27,540
No, I'm talking to you guys.

2178
01:25:27,980 --> 01:25:31,700
That's the Valorant CS 5v5 thingy.

2179
01:25:31,800 --> 01:25:32,680
Oh god.

2180
01:25:33,520 --> 01:25:34,720
That's crazy though.

2181
01:25:34,780 --> 01:25:34,920
It's pretty rough.

2182
01:25:35,020 --> 01:25:37,740
I feel like the moment the bomb goes down...

2183
01:25:37,740 --> 01:25:39,140
It's not even about the bomb.

2184
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:40,780
No, that's finals.

2185
01:25:42,020 --> 01:25:44,000
It's okay, we don't have to think about the finals.

2186
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:48,420
We don't have to think about the finals.

2187
01:25:48,420 --> 01:25:50,660
Let's just think about surviving first.

2188
01:25:50,680 --> 01:25:52,660
The last time we went to the last place...

2189
01:25:52,660 --> 01:25:53,380
And stuff...

2190
01:25:53,380 --> 01:25:56,340
There was a huge issue where...

2191
01:25:56,340 --> 01:25:57,980
It just never felt like...

2192
01:25:57,980 --> 01:25:59,800
It was about the bomb anymore.

2193
01:25:59,960 --> 01:26:00,820
It was just about the shooting.

2194
01:26:01,220 --> 01:26:02,800
It was because it was very laggy.

2195
01:26:03,660 --> 01:26:05,560
Yeah, it was so laggy.

2196
01:26:05,740 --> 01:26:06,460
Should we race?

2197
01:26:06,560 --> 01:26:09,700
We can try a race.

2198
01:26:10,320 --> 01:26:11,500
We can do...

2199
01:26:11,500 --> 01:26:13,480
I think race or trailblazers.

2200
01:26:13,640 --> 01:26:14,600
What the fuck is this guy?

2201
01:26:15,920 --> 01:26:17,780
Trailblazers is like parkour and stuff.

2202
01:26:17,800 --> 01:26:18,980
No matter what I pick...

2203
01:26:19,880 --> 01:26:21,600
No matter what I pick...

2204
01:26:22,060 --> 01:26:23,140
What I want...

2205
01:26:23,140 --> 01:26:25,260
Nobody would get what I want.

2206
01:26:26,480 --> 01:26:27,920
Take me out of my misery.

2207
01:26:28,140 --> 01:26:29,300
Take me out of my misery.

2208
01:26:29,780 --> 01:26:31,600
TAKE ME OUT OF THIS MISERY!

2209
01:26:34,060 --> 01:26:34,540
Yeeeees.

2210
01:26:36,580 --> 01:26:37,860
And now I leave.

2211
01:26:37,860 --> 01:26:39,420
Look at this target simulator.

2212
01:26:40,280 --> 01:26:42,180
Wait, there's a fucking hot air balloon.

2213
01:26:42,560 --> 01:26:43,920
Okay, spleef, target...

2214
01:26:44,420 --> 01:26:44,920
Boosfer.

2215
01:26:45,400 --> 01:26:46,300
That's all that matters.

2216
01:26:48,380 --> 01:26:49,740
What is this?

2217
01:26:50,740 --> 01:26:51,580
What do we get?

2218
01:26:51,660 --> 01:26:54,080
You break the blocks below people's feet.

2219
01:26:54,680 --> 01:26:55,260
I escape.

2220
01:26:56,760 --> 01:26:59,160
You get 10 extra points if you kill Boosfer.

2221
01:26:59,980 --> 01:27:01,320
Wait, what is this?

2222
01:27:02,140 --> 01:27:03,740
Spleef, you break the blocks below people's feet.

2223
01:27:03,740 --> 01:27:04,660
Oh, the survive.

2224
01:27:04,660 --> 01:27:06,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2225
01:27:09,620 --> 01:27:11,040
Alright, good luck everyone.

2226
01:27:13,500 --> 01:27:16,320
There's two rounds of this and there's a TNT round.

2227
01:27:17,680 --> 01:27:19,920
This one is pretty chill.

2228
01:27:20,120 --> 01:27:22,200
You just break blocks, you throw snowballs.

2229
01:27:22,300 --> 01:27:22,880
Make friends.

2230
01:27:23,220 --> 01:27:24,880
They'll fuck you over.

2231
01:27:25,460 --> 01:27:26,360
Social game.

2232
01:27:29,020 --> 01:27:30,220
And pray.

2233
01:27:32,220 --> 01:27:34,960
Just present your behind and they'll be okay.

2234
01:27:36,380 --> 01:27:36,860
Yo.

2235
01:27:37,480 --> 01:27:40,660
I mean, you femboys know what to do.

2236
01:27:41,100 --> 01:27:42,940
Yeah, my nape is exposed right there, bro.

2237
01:27:45,660 --> 01:27:48,040
Anyways, guys.

2238
01:27:48,620 --> 01:27:50,020
In this economy, that's what you have to do.

2239
01:27:52,820 --> 01:27:54,240
I didn't want to ask.

2240
01:27:54,480 --> 01:27:55,900
Have you ever seen Attack on Titan?

2241
01:27:56,640 --> 01:27:57,960
It's by far your neck.

2242
01:27:58,620 --> 01:28:00,860
Yeah, that's where the Titan shifters hide, bro.

2243
01:28:00,860 --> 01:28:01,200
What's up?

2244
01:28:02,700 --> 01:28:03,260
Bye.

2245
01:28:04,380 --> 01:28:07,240
You're gonna get a shovel, pickaxe, one of the two.

2246
01:28:07,480 --> 01:28:08,180
Break blocks.

2247
01:28:08,460 --> 01:28:10,060
Careful of people.

2248
01:28:12,440 --> 01:28:14,980
No, they don't want to be friends!

2249
01:28:15,780 --> 01:28:16,720
Second, you bitch!

2250
01:28:17,140 --> 01:28:18,100
Oh, motherfucker!

2251
01:28:20,020 --> 01:28:21,380
Oh, God.

2252
01:28:22,280 --> 01:28:23,940
I'm just gonna...

2253
01:28:23,940 --> 01:28:24,880
I'm just gonna run.

2254
01:28:25,180 --> 01:28:25,760
Fuck this.

2255
01:28:25,980 --> 01:28:26,620
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2256
01:28:27,400 --> 01:28:28,280
Running is lucky.

2257
01:28:28,560 --> 01:28:30,120
Oh, you bitch-ass bitch.

2258
01:28:31,180 --> 01:28:34,440
I don't have the brain capacity to do two things at once.

2259
01:28:34,920 --> 01:28:35,600
No, people are not...

2260
01:28:35,600 --> 01:28:36,660
Oh, I think it's because it's rookie.

2261
01:28:36,780 --> 01:28:39,400
People aren't doing friendship because they don't know.

2262
01:28:40,080 --> 01:28:42,120
Yeah, they're just super angry.

2263
01:28:42,420 --> 01:28:43,900
They're so angry and aggressive.

2264
01:28:44,440 --> 01:28:45,880
All they do is...

2265
01:28:46,380 --> 01:28:48,180
All they do is mind the boss.

2266
01:28:48,200 --> 01:28:48,740
Oh, my God, bro!

2267
01:28:49,600 --> 01:28:50,760
Okay, I may have access...

2268
01:28:51,780 --> 01:28:52,740
I saw that!

2269
01:28:56,780 --> 01:28:57,920
Last layer unlocked.

2270
01:28:57,920 --> 01:28:58,660
Oopsies, guys.

2271
01:29:00,120 --> 01:29:00,960
Fuck you, Shadow.

2272
01:29:01,880 --> 01:29:03,980
Why would you do this?

2273
01:29:04,660 --> 01:29:05,140
Oh, shit.

2274
01:29:06,260 --> 01:29:07,700
Is this the last layer?

2275
01:29:07,880 --> 01:29:08,360
Am I fucked?

2276
01:29:08,460 --> 01:29:09,440
Oh, I'm so fucked.

2277
01:29:11,240 --> 01:29:12,040
Hey, second.

2278
01:29:12,460 --> 01:29:13,200
Fuck out of here, bro.

2279
01:29:15,180 --> 01:29:16,580
Alright, Pyre Software.

2280
01:29:16,780 --> 01:29:18,380
We are gonna be friends!

2281
01:29:19,720 --> 01:29:20,560
Bro, fuck me.

2282
01:29:20,700 --> 01:29:21,160
Oh, God.

2283
01:29:21,880 --> 01:29:23,220
Oh, fucking rain!

2284
01:29:26,740 --> 01:29:27,900
Hello, Demi.

2285
01:29:28,040 --> 01:29:28,600
Hi!

2286
01:29:31,020 --> 01:29:34,500
Dude, I'm actually getting targeted right now.

2287
01:29:34,780 --> 01:29:36,280
Yeah, I have a friend!

2288
01:29:36,400 --> 01:29:37,120
I have a friend!

2289
01:29:40,390 --> 01:29:41,560
Yeah, I have friends!

2290
01:29:43,300 --> 01:29:44,660
No, my friend!

2291
01:29:46,040 --> 01:29:47,280
Can I kill your friend?

2292
01:29:47,780 --> 01:29:50,120
No, I'm at the top layer.

2293
01:29:51,480 --> 01:29:51,840
Friend?

2294
01:29:53,080 --> 01:29:53,380
Friend?

2295
01:29:53,380 --> 01:29:55,820
This top layer is looking very interesting.

2296
01:29:55,820 --> 01:29:57,000
No, Giga, you son of a bitch!

2297
01:29:59,080 --> 01:30:00,060
My friend!

2298
01:30:03,720 --> 01:30:04,840
Who's friending?

2299
01:30:05,860 --> 01:30:06,980
This fucker!

2300
01:30:11,270 --> 01:30:11,950
Nice, Demi.

2301
01:30:13,010 --> 01:30:14,470
I'm on the top layer by myself.

2302
01:30:14,850 --> 01:30:15,410
Shit!

2303
01:30:16,170 --> 01:30:16,450
Fuck!

2304
01:30:17,190 --> 01:30:19,790
I'm so fucked.

2305
01:30:21,110 --> 01:30:21,830
It's fine, bro.

2306
01:30:21,970 --> 01:30:23,150
It's over.

2307
01:30:23,150 --> 01:30:23,670
It's over.

2308
01:30:24,210 --> 01:30:25,150
I'm dead as fuck.

2309
01:30:25,430 --> 01:30:26,570
We're good here.

2310
01:30:28,250 --> 01:30:32,370
I made friends with people, so people were super nice to me.

2311
01:30:32,750 --> 01:30:34,290
Oh, there's a guy below me.

2312
01:30:34,370 --> 01:30:35,330
He doesn't like me.

2313
01:30:36,550 --> 01:30:37,650
It might be Zacian.

2314
01:30:37,770 --> 01:30:39,130
I might have made him a little bit angry.

2315
01:30:39,530 --> 01:30:39,810
Sorry.

2316
01:30:40,190 --> 01:30:41,030
I don't trust Feinberg.

2317
01:30:42,290 --> 01:30:44,550
Feinberg is not attacking, but he's scaring me to shit.

2318
01:30:44,550 --> 01:30:46,130
He really is bleeping, man.

2319
01:30:46,270 --> 01:30:48,730
Dude, Feinberg's just pure aura scares me, man.

2320
01:30:49,150 --> 01:30:50,230
Yeah, I know, right?

2321
01:30:51,770 --> 01:30:52,850
Who did that?

2322
01:30:53,710 --> 01:30:55,590
You got killed by a sandwich lord.

2323
01:30:56,870 --> 01:30:57,230
No!

2324
01:30:57,710 --> 01:31:01,350
I've been for so long at the top, dude!

2325
01:31:01,850 --> 01:31:06,590
And I fell all the way to the bottom after living at the top.

2326
01:31:06,670 --> 01:31:07,450
How are you kidding me?

2327
01:31:08,810 --> 01:31:10,210
I literally fell...

2328
01:31:10,210 --> 01:31:10,710
No!

2329
01:31:12,510 --> 01:31:14,010
I fell at like...

2330
01:31:14,010 --> 01:31:14,850
Oh my god.

2331
01:31:15,310 --> 01:31:15,570
Come on, Demi.

2332
01:31:15,610 --> 01:31:16,370
No, Demi, no!

2333
01:31:17,770 --> 01:31:18,810
You did well, Demi.

2334
01:31:18,810 --> 01:31:19,910
I killed him.

2335
01:31:20,410 --> 01:31:22,990
You went crazy, dude.

2336
01:31:24,230 --> 01:31:25,630
You got third.

2337
01:31:26,070 --> 01:31:28,330
I did not get to kill him, but that's all good.

2338
01:31:30,270 --> 01:31:33,090
Guys, just do that again.

2339
01:31:33,170 --> 01:31:33,590
That was good.

2340
01:31:34,250 --> 01:31:35,730
Just make friends.

2341
01:31:36,390 --> 01:31:37,610
Make friends, but trade them.

2342
01:31:39,290 --> 01:31:42,090
Red team is not our friend, I think.

2343
01:31:42,870 --> 01:31:43,550
No, no, no.

2344
01:31:44,070 --> 01:31:46,350
Pirate software was super nice.

2345
01:31:46,350 --> 01:31:47,830
Wait, but he's not red.

2346
01:31:47,910 --> 01:31:48,490
He's not pink.

2347
01:31:51,730 --> 01:31:54,150
He was very nice to me.

2348
01:31:54,870 --> 01:31:55,950
Oh my god, they started!

2349
01:31:57,390 --> 01:31:58,610
I was not ready for this.

2350
01:31:59,310 --> 01:31:59,830
These fuckers.

2351
01:32:00,690 --> 01:32:01,450
Oh, that's one down.

2352
01:32:01,790 --> 01:32:03,210
Oh god!

2353
01:32:06,650 --> 01:32:08,530
Please don't do this to me.

2354
01:32:09,310 --> 01:32:11,210
I love the sound effect of breaking the blocks.

2355
01:32:11,450 --> 01:32:12,250
Oh, nice, nice, nice.

2356
01:32:15,370 --> 01:32:16,490
I'm so sorry.

2357
01:32:20,770 --> 01:32:21,890
Oh god.

2358
01:32:22,490 --> 01:32:26,110
Dude, these fuckers are so fast with fucking sleeping, man.

2359
01:32:26,330 --> 01:32:27,270
It's crazy.

2360
01:32:28,010 --> 01:32:29,770
These motherfuckers need to stop.

2361
01:32:31,030 --> 01:32:31,790
Oh, he's after me!

2362
01:32:34,330 --> 01:32:37,170
I'm on the third layer, so I'm going to play very carefully.

2363
01:32:37,170 --> 01:32:37,630
Yeah, me too.

2364
01:32:39,790 --> 01:32:41,030
Oh, you fucking bitch.

2365
01:32:41,470 --> 01:32:41,870
Stop!

2366
01:32:42,950 --> 01:32:44,390
Whoever did that, fuck you.

2367
01:32:44,450 --> 01:32:45,090
Holy shit.

2368
01:32:45,190 --> 01:32:46,010
That was insane.

2369
01:32:46,850 --> 01:32:48,450
It's the fucking Among Us skin!

2370
01:32:49,410 --> 01:32:50,010
Amogus, guys.

2371
01:32:50,630 --> 01:32:51,030
Amogus!

2372
01:32:52,590 --> 01:32:53,470
Alright, I'm targeting Amici.

2373
01:32:54,370 --> 01:32:55,130
This is terrifying.

2374
01:32:58,090 --> 01:33:00,410
This is so terrifying when you're at the top.

2375
01:33:00,510 --> 01:33:06,130
Because it's like, when you're at the top, it's like everybody wants to kill you, and then you don't know where to go.

2376
01:33:06,330 --> 01:33:12,250
You can fall to the very bottom accidentally, and it's terrifying.

2377
01:33:13,070 --> 01:33:14,970
Oh, I killed Grimmy!

2378
01:33:15,390 --> 01:33:16,330
Oh my god!

2379
01:33:17,070 --> 01:33:18,490
Line, we should really stay in this level.

2380
01:33:18,490 --> 01:33:19,750
I killed someone else!

2381
01:33:19,750 --> 01:33:22,610
You guys got that.

2382
01:33:23,250 --> 01:33:23,730
Shiraz!

2383
01:33:24,190 --> 01:33:24,790
No!

2384
01:33:26,530 --> 01:33:28,510
I fall to the bottom.

2385
01:33:29,370 --> 01:33:31,470
I'm like, wait, Sleepy's actually targeting me.

2386
01:33:31,570 --> 01:33:32,250
This is crazy, man.

2387
01:33:32,550 --> 01:33:33,650
Please leave me alone.

2388
01:33:34,450 --> 01:33:35,590
I miss having friends.

2389
01:33:35,590 --> 01:33:36,850
I miss having friends.

2390
01:33:36,950 --> 01:33:37,750
Nice one, Obi!

2391
01:33:37,930 --> 01:33:38,670
Nice one, nice one!

2392
01:33:40,150 --> 01:33:41,370
Oh god, one second.

2393
01:33:41,650 --> 01:33:42,550
We've made the mad...

2394
01:33:42,550 --> 01:33:45,130
It's like punching a wasp's nest.

2395
01:33:45,410 --> 01:33:48,050
The whole team is gravitating...

2396
01:33:48,050 --> 01:33:48,910
Having friends was so fun.

2397
01:33:49,770 --> 01:33:50,890
I miss it.

2398
01:33:52,310 --> 01:33:52,530
No!

2399
01:33:53,730 --> 01:33:54,250
Dude!

2400
01:33:54,350 --> 01:33:56,150
Fucking Michi, man.

2401
01:33:57,190 --> 01:33:58,090
I got three kills, though.

2402
01:33:58,110 --> 01:33:58,590
That was pretty good.

2403
01:33:59,790 --> 01:34:01,170
We're good, we're good.

2404
01:34:01,330 --> 01:34:02,030
Just chill.

2405
01:34:02,030 --> 01:34:04,170
Yeah, I'm evading the sensor.

2406
01:34:07,850 --> 01:34:09,650
I'm the last level.

2407
01:34:12,630 --> 01:34:13,730
That's fine, dude.

2408
01:34:17,270 --> 01:34:20,190
Look, you're so getting targeted, dude.

2409
01:34:20,270 --> 01:34:20,630
Holy shit.

2410
01:34:20,690 --> 01:34:23,430
I miss having friends.

2411
01:34:23,950 --> 01:34:25,190
Holy shit, holy shit.

2412
01:34:25,230 --> 01:34:26,810
Oh, nice, though!

2413
01:34:26,930 --> 01:34:27,870
Holy fuck!

2414
01:34:28,030 --> 01:34:29,270
No, I died first!

2415
01:34:30,530 --> 01:34:31,850
I got points, though.

2416
01:34:31,910 --> 01:34:32,750
I got points for it.

2417
01:34:33,250 --> 01:34:34,070
That's good, that's good.

2418
01:34:34,470 --> 01:34:35,870
I got two points from kills.

2419
01:34:37,070 --> 01:34:37,550
Useless.

2420
01:34:38,270 --> 01:34:42,030
I miss the two friends I made in the first game.

2421
01:34:42,270 --> 01:34:43,390
Wow, Ashlea is still on top.

2422
01:34:43,770 --> 01:34:44,250
Jesus.

2423
01:34:45,830 --> 01:34:49,510
Yeah, but he can get very unlucky if he fell straight down.

2424
01:34:49,690 --> 01:34:50,310
Oh, true.

2425
01:34:50,550 --> 01:34:52,070
Oh, look at Wolfie.

2426
01:34:52,450 --> 01:34:54,030
Oh my god!

2427
01:34:54,190 --> 01:34:57,550
Can you left click and hit somebody or does it have to be snowball?

2428
01:34:57,550 --> 01:34:58,370
Go, Wolfie!

2429
01:34:58,410 --> 01:35:00,370
Oh, Wolfie's dead.

2430
01:35:00,850 --> 01:35:02,350
You can punch somebody, right?

2431
01:35:02,450 --> 01:35:03,250
You can punch, right?

2432
01:35:03,330 --> 01:35:05,910
You can punch?

2433
01:35:06,170 --> 01:35:06,270
Okay.

2434
01:35:07,590 --> 01:35:11,470
Wait, you can or you can't?

2435
01:35:12,010 --> 01:35:12,770
You cannot.

2436
01:35:13,050 --> 01:35:14,130
Wait a second, guys.

2437
01:35:14,250 --> 01:35:14,610
We're doing good.

2438
01:35:15,130 --> 01:35:17,790
Okay, this one, you get a bow and arrow.

2439
01:35:18,790 --> 01:35:20,890
When you shoot, it's like a 3x3 area.

2440
01:35:21,010 --> 01:35:23,290
You also get a crossbow that's automatically charged.

2441
01:35:23,390 --> 01:35:25,270
You can, like, jump up with it.

2442
01:35:26,430 --> 01:35:27,630
Yeah, you can launch yourself.

2443
01:35:27,630 --> 01:35:27,630
You can what?

2444
01:35:27,770 --> 01:35:28,610
Jump up and what?

2445
01:35:28,930 --> 01:35:30,530
You can launch yourself up.

2446
01:35:30,610 --> 01:35:31,930
You can, like, test it at the start.

2447
01:35:33,550 --> 01:35:34,350
Yeah, yeah, rocket jump.

2448
01:35:34,390 --> 01:35:35,050
We can rocket jump.

2449
01:35:35,170 --> 01:35:36,310
I forgot about rocket jumping.

2450
01:35:37,030 --> 01:35:39,090
I don't trust myself rocket jumping.

2451
01:35:39,110 --> 01:35:39,970
I don't know for, like, just fighting people.

2452
01:35:40,130 --> 01:35:41,890
I don't trust myself at all.

2453
01:35:43,290 --> 01:35:45,830
Oh, Wolfie!

2454
01:35:45,870 --> 01:35:46,130
Sorry!

2455
01:35:46,770 --> 01:35:47,890
I thought it was you!

2456
01:35:50,670 --> 01:35:51,950
I almost fell all the way down.

2457
01:35:51,950 --> 01:35:54,450
Oh, my goodness.

2458
01:35:54,630 --> 01:35:55,410
Jesus Christ.

2459
01:35:55,630 --> 01:35:55,970
We're good.

2460
01:35:57,150 --> 01:35:58,490
Oh, my God.

2461
01:35:59,990 --> 01:36:01,310
The whole lobby.

2462
01:36:01,490 --> 01:36:02,390
The whole lobby.

2463
01:36:03,190 --> 01:36:03,930
Be angry.

2464
01:36:06,550 --> 01:36:08,090
That's crazy, but...

2465
01:36:08,090 --> 01:36:09,110
I'll figure it out, though.

2466
01:36:09,230 --> 01:36:09,610
It's true.

2467
01:36:11,790 --> 01:36:12,350
Oh, yeah.

2468
01:36:12,730 --> 01:36:13,890
That's definitely the reason.

2469
01:36:14,110 --> 01:36:14,490
Oh, sorry.

2470
01:36:14,590 --> 01:36:15,570
I shot you away.

2471
01:36:16,550 --> 01:36:17,110
Oh, my God.

2472
01:36:17,350 --> 01:36:17,370
Oh, yeah.

2473
01:36:17,370 --> 01:36:18,130
Fuck you, Archibald.

2474
01:36:22,050 --> 01:36:22,570
Fuck you!

2475
01:36:23,350 --> 01:36:24,450
Oh, shit.

2476
01:36:24,730 --> 01:36:25,070
Oh, God.

2477
01:36:25,150 --> 01:36:25,550
Oh, God.

2478
01:36:25,850 --> 01:36:26,810
I hate these VTubers.

2479
01:36:27,950 --> 01:36:28,650
Yo, same.

2480
01:36:30,190 --> 01:36:31,890
Yeah, fuck them VTubers, dude.

2481
01:36:32,010 --> 01:36:32,170
No.

2482
01:36:33,070 --> 01:36:35,070
You can use your arrows to shoot people, too.

2483
01:36:35,090 --> 01:36:36,090
I can't do it.

2484
01:36:36,110 --> 01:36:36,710
It's so hard.

2485
01:36:37,370 --> 01:36:39,350
It might be a pain thing.

2486
01:36:39,610 --> 01:36:41,970
It might be, like, really difficult with pain.

2487
01:36:43,070 --> 01:36:44,370
Fuck, it's so hard.

2488
01:36:44,450 --> 01:36:44,950
I can't.

2489
01:36:45,130 --> 01:36:47,550
You can, like, shoot people with the bow.

2490
01:36:48,230 --> 01:36:49,190
Yeah, like, directly.

2491
01:36:52,730 --> 01:36:53,170
Oh.

2492
01:36:54,390 --> 01:36:55,410
I'm coming for revenge.

2493
01:36:55,530 --> 01:36:55,910
Never mind.

2494
01:36:58,470 --> 01:36:59,210
Oh, shit.

2495
01:36:59,430 --> 01:36:59,770
Oh, God.

2496
01:37:01,490 --> 01:37:01,890
Okay.

2497
01:37:02,010 --> 01:37:02,890
I didn't even land.

2498
01:37:03,890 --> 01:37:04,270
Oh, God.

2499
01:37:05,970 --> 01:37:06,910
Fuck you, Among Us.

2500
01:37:07,690 --> 01:37:08,930
I got the Among Us.

2501
01:37:09,190 --> 01:37:09,910
Oh, God, no!

2502
01:37:10,110 --> 01:37:10,430
I'm dead.

2503
01:37:10,590 --> 01:37:10,730
Fuck.

2504
01:37:12,190 --> 01:37:13,110
I got three kills, though.

2505
01:37:13,830 --> 01:37:14,230
Nice.

2506
01:37:15,010 --> 01:37:15,890
Jesus Christ.

2507
01:37:16,710 --> 01:37:17,470
Where am I going?

2508
01:37:17,470 --> 01:37:17,490
Where am I going?

2509
01:37:24,620 --> 01:37:26,800
I don't trust myself rocket jumping.

2510
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:29,180
Last time I tried rocket jumping, I actually died.

2511
01:37:30,580 --> 01:37:30,900
Yeah.

2512
01:37:31,120 --> 01:37:31,780
I believe in you.

2513
01:37:32,080 --> 01:37:32,920
Oh, my God, what the hell?

2514
01:37:34,420 --> 01:37:35,380
People keep shooting me.

2515
01:37:35,760 --> 01:37:36,220
Okay.

2516
01:37:37,660 --> 01:37:39,460
Maybe this is my...

2517
01:37:39,460 --> 01:37:40,700
Oh, you did it!

2518
01:37:41,660 --> 01:37:44,120
I got pre-fired by fucking infected men.

2519
01:37:44,360 --> 01:37:45,160
Holy shit.

2520
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:48,720
Damn, Doki.

2521
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:49,700
You look like a porcupine.

2522
01:37:49,800 --> 01:37:50,300
Holy shit.

2523
01:37:50,300 --> 01:37:52,800
Dude, I got a cook at the...

2524
01:37:52,800 --> 01:37:53,580
No, no!

2525
01:37:56,040 --> 01:37:57,060
Oh, no.

2526
01:37:59,020 --> 01:38:00,120
I think I got one.

2527
01:38:00,360 --> 01:38:00,780
No!

2528
01:38:03,180 --> 01:38:05,040
I was doing so well, too.

2529
01:38:05,480 --> 01:38:06,400
Oh, damn.

2530
01:38:06,740 --> 01:38:07,260
Fuck.

2531
01:38:07,520 --> 01:38:10,240
I actually figured out how to rocket jump.

2532
01:38:11,600 --> 01:38:12,280
We're good.

2533
01:38:13,980 --> 01:38:15,440
Don't let Sleepy live.

2534
01:38:15,520 --> 01:38:16,280
Don't let him live.

2535
01:38:17,280 --> 01:38:17,700
It's you.

2536
01:38:17,840 --> 01:38:18,500
It's 1v...

2537
01:38:18,500 --> 01:38:19,500
Oh, it's 1v1.

2538
01:38:19,720 --> 01:38:20,320
Oh, 1v2.

2539
01:38:20,860 --> 01:38:21,980
Oh, Wolfie, watch out.

2540
01:38:22,120 --> 01:38:22,300
Yo!

2541
01:38:22,640 --> 01:38:23,080
Yo!

2542
01:38:23,720 --> 01:38:24,480
No way!

2543
01:38:24,840 --> 01:38:26,600
Oh, my God, he's actually gaming.

2544
01:38:26,900 --> 01:38:27,100
No!

2545
01:38:28,440 --> 01:38:31,020
He jumped on the only other yellow.

2546
01:38:31,420 --> 01:38:32,840
That's actually crazy.

2547
01:38:34,340 --> 01:38:35,640
That is insane.

2548
01:38:36,520 --> 01:38:37,560
Holy shit.

2549
01:38:38,200 --> 01:38:40,300
He jumped on the only other one.

2550
01:38:40,600 --> 01:38:41,740
Wait, how many games is it?

2551
01:38:42,980 --> 01:38:44,160
We might not get it, guys.

2552
01:38:44,760 --> 01:38:45,260
Oh, my God.

2553
01:38:45,260 --> 01:38:45,280
Let's go!

2554
01:38:46,940 --> 01:38:47,920
The bare minimum!

2555
01:38:48,220 --> 01:38:48,760
Let's go!

2556
01:38:49,040 --> 01:38:49,700
Let's go!

2557
01:38:51,160 --> 01:38:52,360
Eight people.

2558
01:38:53,700 --> 01:38:55,540
Yeah, he just went for Vtubers.

2559
01:38:56,040 --> 01:38:56,760
Let's go!

2560
01:38:58,920 --> 01:39:00,620
Ban all Minecraft players.

2561
01:39:02,300 --> 01:39:05,060
Hey, not last.

2562
01:39:05,720 --> 01:39:07,100
The bare minimum!

2563
01:39:07,340 --> 01:39:07,940
Let's go!

2564
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:11,100
Wait, how is the comments doing so much better now?

2565
01:39:11,460 --> 01:39:14,280
Because they got 300 more points than us in this game.

2566
01:39:15,140 --> 01:39:16,020
Oh, wow.

2567
01:39:16,080 --> 01:39:18,360
The point gap is pretty close across the board.

2568
01:39:18,920 --> 01:39:20,300
It's the red debuff, bro.

2569
01:39:20,680 --> 01:39:21,600
Just ignore blue team.

2570
01:39:22,280 --> 01:39:24,440
How many more games do we have left?

2571
01:39:24,560 --> 01:39:24,980
I forgot.

2572
01:39:26,460 --> 01:39:27,300
We're halfway?

2573
01:39:28,660 --> 01:39:29,740
Yeah, we're halfway through.

2574
01:39:30,720 --> 01:39:33,020
We've played like one of the lot...

2575
01:39:33,020 --> 01:39:33,940
We've played two of the lot.

2576
01:39:34,160 --> 01:39:35,460
I'm almost top 10!

2577
01:39:35,580 --> 01:39:35,840
Let's go!

2578
01:39:36,060 --> 01:39:37,300
I'm 23rd!

2579
01:39:37,840 --> 01:39:39,000
I'm almost top 10!

2580
01:39:39,120 --> 01:39:39,580
Let's go!

2581
01:39:40,720 --> 01:39:41,760
I'm 14th!

2582
01:39:41,820 --> 01:39:42,580
Let's go!

2583
01:39:42,940 --> 01:39:45,160
I don't know what I did, but let's fucking go!

2584
01:39:47,100 --> 01:39:48,140
I'm 40th!

2585
01:39:48,320 --> 01:39:49,520
Let's fucking go!

2586
01:39:50,020 --> 01:39:51,240
I'm 40th!

2587
01:39:52,040 --> 01:39:54,280
It's your first tournament.

2588
01:39:54,540 --> 01:39:55,520
It's your first one.

2589
01:39:57,420 --> 01:39:59,280
This is my second one, but it's okay.

2590
01:39:59,500 --> 01:40:00,960
Is it actually last place?

2591
01:40:01,300 --> 01:40:02,660
Yeah, 40th is dead last.

2592
01:40:02,680 --> 01:40:04,020
No, there's a 41st player.

2593
01:40:04,840 --> 01:40:05,860
Don't listen to them.

2594
01:40:05,900 --> 01:40:06,980
There's a 41st player.

2595
01:40:07,820 --> 01:40:09,280
You're like second last.

2596
01:40:09,420 --> 01:40:09,920
Which is better!

2597
01:40:11,040 --> 01:40:12,780
It's better because we're second last too.

2598
01:40:15,900 --> 01:40:19,240
Yeah, there's a 41st player.

2599
01:40:19,400 --> 01:40:21,260
You just can't scroll down to see it.

2600
01:40:21,420 --> 01:40:25,020
I know, I know.

2601
01:40:25,540 --> 01:40:26,580
Life is good, isn't it?

2602
01:40:26,580 --> 01:40:28,780
Slight difference, but that's what we're here for.

2603
01:40:29,440 --> 01:40:32,020
I'm like a couple of points behind.

2604
01:40:32,680 --> 01:40:34,760
Dude, I'm getting diffed by fucking Zacid.

2605
01:40:34,760 --> 01:40:35,800
He hasn't even played before.

2606
01:40:35,960 --> 01:40:37,120
That's actually insane.

2607
01:40:38,120 --> 01:40:38,580
Wow.

2608
01:40:42,220 --> 01:40:43,360
Oh my god.

2609
01:40:43,360 --> 01:40:45,720
Is SandwichLord a veteran in the Minecraft?

2610
01:40:45,980 --> 01:40:47,320
Yeah, of course, from behind.

2611
01:40:48,200 --> 01:40:50,840
SandwichLord is like a very good event player.

2612
01:40:51,960 --> 01:40:53,480
Dude, Misty is 7th.

2613
01:40:53,480 --> 01:40:54,100
I'm kind of disappointed.

2614
01:40:54,280 --> 01:40:55,000
Misty, pick it up, man.

2615
01:40:56,600 --> 01:40:59,960
Is he considered the rookie or the pro in this team?

2616
01:41:00,040 --> 01:41:00,620
I love Misty.

2617
01:41:01,200 --> 01:41:01,680
Sleepy?

2618
01:41:02,080 --> 01:41:03,600
No, Misty.

2619
01:41:03,900 --> 01:41:04,360
Mistycat.

2620
01:41:04,380 --> 01:41:05,860
Misty is the pro.

2621
01:41:09,440 --> 01:41:11,080
Misty is kind of goated.

2622
01:41:11,540 --> 01:41:13,080
Misty made a circle in Minecraft.

2623
01:41:13,640 --> 01:41:14,320
Yeah, yeah.

2624
01:41:14,340 --> 01:41:17,180
Because I remember you were saying Misty was a rookie in the last one.

2625
01:41:17,340 --> 01:41:22,180
So I was like confused how Misty could be a rookie in the last rookie tournament.

2626
01:41:23,160 --> 01:41:23,500
True.

2627
01:41:23,800 --> 01:41:26,080
This game is silly.

2628
01:41:27,160 --> 01:41:27,680
Yo.

2629
01:41:28,240 --> 01:41:30,180
Wow, look at Wolfy be number 6, bro.

2630
01:41:30,180 --> 01:41:31,360
Let's fucking go.

2631
01:41:31,360 --> 01:41:33,620
Yeah, you know Lightwork.

2632
01:41:33,860 --> 01:41:35,080
That's a rep, you know.

2633
01:41:36,180 --> 01:41:38,220
It's almost like they organized the event.

2634
01:41:38,480 --> 01:41:39,640
They did in fact check me, guys.

2635
01:41:39,940 --> 01:41:43,340
So like, let's protect guys because they think I'm 15.

2636
01:41:43,660 --> 01:41:45,860
Okay, I've successfully gaslighted them.

2637
01:41:46,460 --> 01:41:51,340
I actually don't know.

2638
01:41:51,620 --> 01:41:54,160
I've successfully gaslighted them.

2639
01:41:58,880 --> 01:42:00,240
That matters.

2640
01:42:00,580 --> 01:42:02,460
That's all that matters.

2641
01:42:03,040 --> 01:42:04,720
If he's higher than me, I might cry.

2642
01:42:06,500 --> 01:42:07,220
I might leave.

2643
01:42:09,040 --> 01:42:09,720
12th?

2644
01:42:12,400 --> 01:42:13,080
Alright.

2645
01:42:13,780 --> 01:42:15,040
Where's the overall?

2646
01:42:15,620 --> 01:42:16,920
Hey, Among Uskin.

2647
01:42:17,980 --> 01:42:19,340
Among Uskin.

2648
01:42:19,720 --> 01:42:20,300
I mean, it's pretty.

2649
01:42:21,600 --> 01:42:23,940
That's such a funny just a sentence.

2650
01:42:24,660 --> 01:42:25,340
Among Uskin.

2651
01:42:27,480 --> 01:42:28,800
Who's Peter Griffin?

2652
01:42:29,480 --> 01:42:30,760
I'm pretty sure that's Tom.

2653
01:42:30,800 --> 01:42:31,660
I'm pretty sure that's Tom.

2654
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:33,020
Yeah, Tom.

2655
01:42:33,220 --> 01:42:33,420
Peter?

2656
01:42:39,400 --> 01:42:40,280
Hey, Peter.

2657
01:42:41,060 --> 01:42:42,120
Why do you spell it like that?

2658
01:42:42,480 --> 01:42:44,560
My God, I've got more than...

2659
01:42:47,860 --> 01:42:53,060
In the last game, all I'm saying...

2660
01:42:53,060 --> 01:42:53,740
I don't like the bread.

2661
01:42:54,280 --> 01:42:55,160
It's pretty good.

2662
01:42:56,780 --> 01:42:59,260
All I'm saying, this is where I'm at.

2663
01:42:59,260 --> 01:43:00,940
We went crazy last game.

2664
01:43:04,420 --> 01:43:10,120
This is where some of the Minecraft pros are at.

2665
01:43:10,200 --> 01:43:11,640
That's not me.

2666
01:43:13,100 --> 01:43:13,640
My bad, guys.

2667
01:43:14,960 --> 01:43:16,700
That's all that matters.

2668
01:43:16,700 --> 01:43:16,840
That's all that matters.

2669
01:43:23,070 --> 01:43:24,350
My bad, guys.

2670
01:43:25,050 --> 01:43:27,410
Imagine a grandpa in thigh-highs and skirt.

2671
01:43:27,690 --> 01:43:30,870
I was surprised how well I did during Spleef.

2672
01:43:32,290 --> 01:43:34,710
I thought Spleef is more about parkour.

2673
01:43:35,350 --> 01:43:39,590
I was very surprised while I was doing it.

2674
01:43:39,970 --> 01:43:41,150
I was actually...

2675
01:43:41,150 --> 01:43:43,110
Are you guys proud of me?

2676
01:43:43,370 --> 01:43:44,890
I was rocket jumping.

2677
01:43:44,890 --> 01:43:47,390
If I didn't fuck up with...

2678
01:43:48,050 --> 01:43:50,450
If I didn't fuck up with...

2679
01:43:53,630 --> 01:43:58,270
The first Spleef round, I fucking fell straight down.

2680
01:43:59,470 --> 01:44:02,050
That's because I fell straight down.

2681
01:44:02,350 --> 01:44:04,850
I could have lived for so long.

2682
01:44:05,910 --> 01:44:07,670
I could have lived for so long.

2683
01:44:10,630 --> 01:44:11,790
I'm going to get some water.

2684
01:44:13,470 --> 01:44:14,730
Yeah, me too, actually.

2685
01:44:15,170 --> 01:44:16,430
I'm doing it, guys.

2686
01:44:16,670 --> 01:44:17,470
I'm getting better.

2687
01:44:18,070 --> 01:44:20,130
Hardcore Minecraft trained me for this.

2688
01:44:20,210 --> 01:44:20,890
It did.

2689
01:44:21,550 --> 01:44:23,410
It trained me so well.

2690
01:44:24,470 --> 01:44:27,330
I think it's because I understand the game now, too.

2691
01:44:27,590 --> 01:44:32,610
Because when I first loaded in to the block wars, I didn't know what the fuck I was doing.

2692
01:44:36,070 --> 01:44:40,330
I didn't know what the games are, but now I know.

2693
01:44:43,090 --> 01:44:45,650
Shooting all those gas prepared me for this.

2694
01:44:46,950 --> 01:44:54,230
I could actually aim because of all the fucking gas I had to fight during that 14-hour run.

2695
01:44:57,110 --> 01:44:58,910
14-hour run.

2696
01:44:59,510 --> 01:45:01,550
I figured out how to shoot.

2697
01:45:01,690 --> 01:45:04,450
I think that also helped me a lot with shooting the bow.

2698
01:45:06,990 --> 01:45:10,270
The amount of gas I had to fucking kill.

2699
01:45:11,490 --> 01:45:18,830
I tried to convince Min to play block wars, but she was really anxious about a tournament setting.

2700
01:45:20,370 --> 01:45:22,130
She was like, oh my gosh, it's a tournament.

2701
01:45:22,290 --> 01:45:22,850
I don't know.

2702
01:45:23,910 --> 01:45:24,710
Maybe next time.

2703
01:45:25,070 --> 01:45:26,550
No, I don't want peer pressure here.

2704
01:45:28,470 --> 01:45:29,830
Because I was like, oh, it's rookies.

2705
01:45:29,910 --> 01:45:30,690
It's a beginner place.

2706
01:45:30,690 --> 01:45:31,790
I am moisturized.

2707
01:45:33,390 --> 01:45:34,150
Hydrated even.

2708
01:45:34,610 --> 01:45:41,490
Yeah, I was trying to convince her to be on my team for this block wars.

2709
01:45:41,670 --> 01:45:43,310
Because they were telling me it was all beginners.

2710
01:45:43,610 --> 01:45:45,090
I was like, oh my god, that's good.

2711
01:45:45,710 --> 01:45:47,910
She was really anxious about a tournament setting.

2712
01:45:50,070 --> 01:45:51,230
It's still competitive.

2713
01:45:51,870 --> 01:45:53,170
Even if it's laid back.

2714
01:45:53,290 --> 01:45:58,030
I was getting super competitive in the first game because I was just like, guys!

2715
01:45:58,030 --> 01:45:58,530
Guys!

2716
01:45:59,090 --> 01:45:59,610
Portal!

2717
01:45:59,890 --> 01:46:00,890
Portal, guys!

2718
01:46:01,190 --> 01:46:01,490
Portal!

2719
01:46:02,590 --> 01:46:07,970
After the first game, I swapped my mindset because it's more casual and stuff.

2720
01:46:08,410 --> 01:46:11,530
I'm just playing the game.

2721
01:46:13,110 --> 01:46:14,710
It's definitely very...

2722
01:46:14,710 --> 01:46:20,790
Even if it's more laid back, it's still competitive.

2723
01:46:22,210 --> 01:46:23,450
I was just like, what the fuck?

2724
01:46:23,510 --> 01:46:24,530
She was like, oh.

2725
01:46:24,530 --> 01:46:29,550
This guy was like, I'm going to put a honey pot in my fruit punch.

2726
01:46:29,630 --> 01:46:32,490
I'm locked in today.

2727
01:46:32,930 --> 01:46:33,550
Are you drugging people?

2728
01:46:33,690 --> 01:46:34,010
What's happening?

2729
01:46:34,370 --> 01:46:35,830
What the fuck is happening, bro?

2730
01:46:36,010 --> 01:46:38,130
Guys are going to be bricked up walking in the mall.

2731
01:46:38,510 --> 01:46:39,610
Yeah, yeah.

2732
01:46:40,310 --> 01:46:48,050
Lowkey though, I feel like spiking your friends because the first tournament, I was so locked in.

2733
01:46:48,330 --> 01:46:53,670
Not locked in, but people were so fucking competitive in the first Black Wars I did.

2734
01:46:54,390 --> 01:46:57,890
My heart was beating hard, but this one, I'm more relaxed.

2735
01:46:58,730 --> 01:47:03,130
I think that's why I perform better when I'm super relaxed as well.

2736
01:47:03,610 --> 01:47:04,670
What is this conversation?

2737
01:47:05,270 --> 01:47:05,490
Yeah.

2738
01:47:16,130 --> 01:47:17,690
You're second to the last.

2739
01:47:17,730 --> 01:47:18,270
What's going on?

2740
01:47:19,250 --> 01:47:22,030
That is why he's second to last.

2741
01:47:22,350 --> 01:47:23,930
That's the reason why.

2742
01:47:24,690 --> 01:47:26,210
What the fuck, man?

2743
01:47:26,570 --> 01:47:29,090
It's November, guys.

2744
01:47:30,050 --> 01:47:30,710
It's NNN.

2745
01:47:32,130 --> 01:47:33,330
It's NNN.

2746
01:47:34,430 --> 01:47:37,530
God, I'm here for a fun time, not a long time.

2747
01:47:37,650 --> 01:47:38,130
Goddamn.

2748
01:47:38,230 --> 01:47:38,850
No, no, no.

2749
01:47:39,090 --> 01:47:39,850
It's just November.

2750
01:47:40,030 --> 01:47:41,750
You shouldn't be having fun right now.

2751
01:47:43,110 --> 01:47:47,090
Listen, it's fucking lying talking about the fucking honey pack and shit, bro.

2752
01:47:48,510 --> 01:47:51,030
Feeding by Yagra takes fucking friends and shit, too.

2753
01:47:51,770 --> 01:47:53,050
Norwegians go hard.

2754
01:47:54,570 --> 01:47:55,510
Imagine, though.

2755
01:47:55,590 --> 01:47:57,790
You have the local fruit punch in the sink.

2756
01:47:57,870 --> 01:47:58,870
You know, the big-ass fruit punch.

2757
01:48:01,030 --> 01:48:02,970
Everyone just gets very confused.

2758
01:48:03,670 --> 01:48:04,190
That's very funny.

2759
01:48:05,710 --> 01:48:07,210
Everyone gets confused.

2760
01:48:08,530 --> 01:48:10,590
Everyone's like, I didn't check in on time.

2761
01:48:11,090 --> 01:48:13,550
I'm a worker, bro.

2762
01:48:13,550 --> 01:48:18,570
As long as we're not I'm happy.

2763
01:48:18,710 --> 01:48:20,610
I can go to dance lessons happy.

2764
01:48:23,330 --> 01:48:28,310
And then also be a bit sad because I'm going to dance lessons.

2765
01:48:33,330 --> 01:48:34,470
It's the goal.

2766
01:48:35,730 --> 01:48:35,990
Crazy.

2767
01:48:37,390 --> 01:48:40,110
It's not fun to be undefeated.

2768
01:48:40,110 --> 01:48:43,470
It sucks that we were straight away defeated.

2769
01:48:44,590 --> 01:48:46,050
I mean, that sucks.

2770
01:48:46,630 --> 01:48:55,110
I mean, it's unfortunate that it's like right away we lose 100%.

2771
01:48:56,310 --> 01:48:57,890
Who's taking a shit, bro?

2772
01:49:00,410 --> 01:49:00,950
What?

2773
01:49:01,410 --> 01:49:04,570
Pirate Software forgot to ready up last one.

2774
01:49:04,570 --> 01:49:06,090
Mm-hmm.

2775
01:49:07,610 --> 01:49:10,050
The people of Toronto want to shop.

2776
01:49:10,410 --> 01:49:10,970
Yeah.

2777
01:49:11,530 --> 01:49:16,290
Some people in this lobby has not even won a single one yet.

2778
01:49:16,690 --> 01:49:17,550
So like...

2779
01:49:17,550 --> 01:49:23,990
I always wonder, people that go into game tournaments what do you think when you fucking have to pee and you're in the middle of...

2780
01:49:23,990 --> 01:49:28,430
Well, you go to the bathroom before it happens.

2781
01:49:29,130 --> 01:49:31,670
Yes, but it still can happen.

2782
01:49:32,170 --> 01:49:35,290
Well, if you're dead, then you have a break.

2783
01:49:35,990 --> 01:49:39,910
And usually in competitive games, you can call for timeouts and stuff.

2784
01:49:40,450 --> 01:49:40,610
Oh.

2785
01:49:41,050 --> 01:49:42,290
But there's a limit.

2786
01:49:42,610 --> 01:49:45,290
Each team has one to two timeouts that they can call.

2787
01:49:45,610 --> 01:49:45,610
Okay.

2788
01:49:46,410 --> 01:49:48,890
I can just imagine Faker being like, fuck, I gotta piss.

2789
01:49:49,170 --> 01:49:49,470
You know?

2790
01:49:51,130 --> 01:49:52,670
I can just imagine that shit.

2791
01:49:53,950 --> 01:49:54,850
Everything is balanced.

2792
01:49:54,850 --> 01:49:56,790
It's like high-stake competitive gaming, bro.

2793
01:49:56,910 --> 01:49:58,110
Who are you?

2794
01:49:58,190 --> 01:49:59,110
I thought we were raiding.

2795
01:49:59,110 --> 01:50:01,050
We already readied up.

2796
01:50:01,370 --> 01:50:02,790
Somebody not readied?

2797
01:50:03,150 --> 01:50:04,950
Red and pink.

2798
01:50:05,270 --> 01:50:05,990
Or Thor, I think.

2799
01:50:06,550 --> 01:50:09,590
I think we should ban every person that looks like that.

2800
01:50:10,510 --> 01:50:11,070
Sleepy.

2801
01:50:11,850 --> 01:50:12,410
Classic.

2802
01:50:14,470 --> 01:50:16,850
Remove them from the lobby!

2803
01:50:18,330 --> 01:50:19,050
And then what?

2804
01:50:19,730 --> 01:50:21,270
And then we just keep going!

2805
01:50:21,330 --> 01:50:22,010
Then we win!

2806
01:50:22,630 --> 01:50:26,430
If we're too soft on them, they will keep...

2807
01:50:26,430 --> 01:50:29,630
They will think there's no punishment.

2808
01:50:30,430 --> 01:50:32,490
That's two players left.

2809
01:50:32,590 --> 01:50:34,490
That will make me on 38th place.

2810
01:50:34,590 --> 01:50:35,590
That's fucking epic, bro.

2811
01:50:35,730 --> 01:50:36,970
Where are you from?

2812
01:50:38,230 --> 01:50:39,310
Sina Kuni.

2813
01:50:39,750 --> 01:50:40,950
Dox yourself now.

2814
01:50:46,490 --> 01:50:49,250
Dox yourself now in front of everybody.

2815
01:50:50,130 --> 01:50:52,310
Might as well just write it in chat.

2816
01:50:52,310 --> 01:50:55,510
Wait, is that actually not allowed?

2817
01:50:56,030 --> 01:50:56,790
I don't think so, no.

2818
01:50:57,090 --> 01:50:58,670
No, no, it's not.

2819
01:50:59,350 --> 01:51:00,310
I don't know.

2820
01:51:00,550 --> 01:51:01,230
I'm sorry.

2821
01:51:01,530 --> 01:51:02,890
I didn't know about that.

2822
01:51:02,950 --> 01:51:03,630
It's okay.

2823
01:51:05,890 --> 01:51:07,350
It's just rules.

2824
01:51:07,770 --> 01:51:09,690
I have a wonder to side-see.

2825
01:51:09,810 --> 01:51:11,350
I'm so fucking sorry.

2826
01:51:13,330 --> 01:51:15,870
I don't really know about that area.

2827
01:51:16,010 --> 01:51:17,730
I speak Spanish.

2828
01:51:17,910 --> 01:51:18,630
That's all I can say.

2829
01:51:19,930 --> 01:51:23,570
It's the difference between YouTube VTubers and Twitch VTubers.

2830
01:51:23,570 --> 01:51:24,670
I'm so sorry.

2831
01:51:25,630 --> 01:51:27,690
You were just curious.

2832
01:51:28,250 --> 01:51:31,370
We have the same accent exactly with my friends.

2833
01:51:31,730 --> 01:51:34,070
I'm so sorry to hear that.

2834
01:51:34,090 --> 01:51:35,490
Why'd you say it like that?

2835
01:51:39,030 --> 01:51:40,930
I'm so sorry to hear that, man.

2836
01:51:41,430 --> 01:51:44,290
Whoever your friend is, I wish them luck.

2837
01:51:45,410 --> 01:51:47,230
Haka is from Orange County Jail.

2838
01:51:47,230 --> 01:51:49,170
Yeah, bro.

2839
01:51:49,190 --> 01:51:50,390
I'm Californian.

2840
01:51:50,530 --> 01:51:51,230
Can't you just tell?

2841
01:51:52,450 --> 01:51:55,090
Well, there's Californians in...

2842
01:51:55,090 --> 01:51:55,290
Wait.

2843
01:51:56,530 --> 01:51:58,490
That's not part of your lore.

2844
01:51:59,990 --> 01:52:02,570
You're ruining the immersion, Haka.

2845
01:52:03,050 --> 01:52:04,670
You're ruining it.

2846
01:52:05,250 --> 01:52:07,270
Holy shit.

2847
01:52:09,190 --> 01:52:11,970
I never knew that you guys are not allowed to say that.

2848
01:52:12,030 --> 01:52:12,510
My bad.

2849
01:52:12,790 --> 01:52:13,790
It's okay.

2850
01:52:13,890 --> 01:52:14,450
Don't worry.

2851
01:52:14,450 --> 01:52:14,450
It's okay.

2852
01:52:14,450 --> 01:52:15,090
Don't worry.

2853
01:52:15,590 --> 01:52:16,490
Alright, guys.

2854
01:52:17,330 --> 01:52:18,490
This is race.

2855
01:52:19,130 --> 01:52:22,190
I love race.

2856
01:52:22,490 --> 01:52:23,430
Wait, is this the same one?

2857
01:52:23,550 --> 01:52:25,250
This is a different map?

2858
01:52:26,910 --> 01:52:29,630
I love this map.

2859
01:52:29,730 --> 01:52:30,990
This is the only map I did this late at.

2860
01:52:32,090 --> 01:52:36,090
Why does this look harder than the fucking first map we did?

2861
01:52:36,530 --> 01:52:37,690
What the fuck is this?

2862
01:52:38,830 --> 01:52:43,890
All I'm saying is that this is definitely not rookie friendly with all this parkour.

2863
01:52:44,090 --> 01:52:44,810
Oh, no, it is.

2864
01:52:44,970 --> 01:52:46,930
Yeah, no, it is.

2865
01:52:47,850 --> 01:52:50,270
I felt like that first one I did seemed more friendly.

2866
01:52:51,670 --> 01:52:57,430
No, the first one we did last time has, like, things where you have to use, like, tridents and stuff.

2867
01:52:57,470 --> 01:52:58,250
And that's kind of hard.

2868
01:52:58,670 --> 01:53:00,170
No, that was cool.

2869
01:53:00,830 --> 01:53:02,130
I like tridents, bro.

2870
01:53:02,150 --> 01:53:02,690
It is cool.

2871
01:53:02,830 --> 01:53:03,190
It's optional.

2872
01:53:03,210 --> 01:53:05,030
I just see so many parkour.

2873
01:53:05,110 --> 01:53:06,190
Just go to the hard path.

2874
01:53:07,110 --> 01:53:07,550
It's fine.

2875
01:53:07,550 --> 01:53:08,370
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2876
01:53:10,390 --> 01:53:11,290
Oh my god.

2877
01:53:11,390 --> 01:53:12,070
Are you okay?

2878
01:53:12,630 --> 01:53:14,850
Wait, where's the starting line?

2879
01:53:16,710 --> 01:53:17,550
It's like a...

2880
01:53:18,110 --> 01:53:19,150
No, I'm going to go hard.

2881
01:53:20,450 --> 01:53:21,410
I'm going to go hard.

2882
01:53:21,730 --> 01:53:23,730
Let's go.

2883
01:53:23,790 --> 01:53:25,050
What's the worst that could happen?

2884
01:53:26,170 --> 01:53:28,250
I mean, if you just miss a jump, you just go down.

2885
01:53:28,390 --> 01:53:29,310
Yeah, exactly.

2886
01:53:29,430 --> 01:53:32,590
Just go down and join the Weenie Hut juniors.

2887
01:53:33,070 --> 01:53:33,910
I was ninth.

2888
01:53:33,910 --> 01:53:34,990
Highlight of my career.

2889
01:53:35,090 --> 01:53:35,510
I was ninth.

2890
01:53:35,690 --> 01:53:36,650
For one second, I was ninth.

2891
01:53:37,370 --> 01:53:38,070
Holy highlight.

2892
01:53:38,470 --> 01:53:39,270
Oh, thank god.

2893
01:53:39,770 --> 01:53:41,390
Oh, shit.

2894
01:53:43,370 --> 01:53:44,210
Guys, lock in.

2895
01:53:44,550 --> 01:53:46,730
Wait, what?

2896
01:53:46,990 --> 01:53:48,830
Oh, you have to jump on those pads.

2897
01:53:48,970 --> 01:53:49,490
I didn't realize.

2898
01:53:51,130 --> 01:53:52,650
Easy path it is.

2899
01:53:53,550 --> 01:53:54,070
Oh my god.

2900
01:53:54,330 --> 01:53:55,570
I got confused.

2901
01:53:56,930 --> 01:53:58,010
He jumped so far.

2902
01:54:00,870 --> 01:54:02,310
No, the boat is where...

2903
01:54:02,310 --> 01:54:03,130
I'm locked in.

2904
01:54:05,250 --> 01:54:06,530
I'm so fucked, guys.

2905
01:54:06,690 --> 01:54:07,470
I'm so fucked.

2906
01:54:07,650 --> 01:54:09,670
Just go forward.

2907
01:54:10,430 --> 01:54:11,030
Just keep going.

2908
01:54:12,330 --> 01:54:12,790
Let's go.

2909
01:54:12,910 --> 01:54:13,070
Let's go.

2910
01:54:13,210 --> 01:54:13,330
Let's go.

2911
01:54:13,470 --> 01:54:14,750
Fuck this shit, bro.

2912
01:54:16,690 --> 01:54:17,030
Oh, boat.

2913
01:54:17,170 --> 01:54:17,550
Okay, fuck.

2914
01:54:18,870 --> 01:54:20,350
You're only going to the boat now?

2915
01:54:20,990 --> 01:54:21,650
Let's go.

2916
01:54:21,790 --> 01:54:22,690
40th place, baby.

2917
01:54:23,010 --> 01:54:23,610
I'm swerving.

2918
01:54:23,850 --> 01:54:24,250
I'm swerving.

2919
01:54:25,050 --> 01:54:26,470
Guys, I'm so fucked.

2920
01:54:26,930 --> 01:54:28,770
Guys, hook up on the sprint button.

2921
01:54:29,310 --> 01:54:30,030
Let's go.

2922
01:54:31,370 --> 01:54:32,410
I'm swerving.

2923
01:54:32,530 --> 01:54:33,010
I'm swerving.

2924
01:54:33,790 --> 01:54:35,330
Dude, I just did a...

2925
01:54:35,330 --> 01:54:37,270
Fucking... I just did a...

2926
01:54:37,270 --> 01:54:38,330
Generational fuck up.

2927
01:54:39,290 --> 01:54:41,330
I got confused.

2928
01:54:42,230 --> 01:54:42,890
I hit my head.

2929
01:54:43,310 --> 01:54:43,990
Oh, god.

2930
01:54:47,370 --> 01:54:49,070
I don't even know what you're laughing at.

2931
01:54:49,130 --> 01:54:49,970
Wait, what?

2932
01:54:50,250 --> 01:54:50,950
You can...

2933
01:54:50,950 --> 01:54:52,190
I'm so fucked.

2934
01:54:52,290 --> 01:54:53,050
I didn't realize.

2935
01:54:54,070 --> 01:54:54,470
Yay!

2936
01:54:55,410 --> 01:54:58,970
If anyone has anything that's not clear, I will try my best.

2937
01:54:59,270 --> 01:55:00,130
Oh, I see sandwich.

2938
01:55:00,230 --> 01:55:02,310
Can you make it clear for me?

2939
01:55:03,470 --> 01:55:04,590
Let me be clear.

2940
01:55:04,810 --> 01:55:05,570
Let me be clear.

2941
01:55:06,050 --> 01:55:07,070
Let me be clear.

2942
01:55:07,490 --> 01:55:09,930
I'm so glad you understood that.

2943
01:55:10,010 --> 01:55:11,870
Because so many people wouldn't.

2944
01:55:13,170 --> 01:55:14,350
That's because of the hard map, bro.

2945
01:55:14,450 --> 01:55:15,070
Fuck this shit.

2946
01:55:15,630 --> 01:55:16,650
We're going hard.

2947
01:55:16,810 --> 01:55:18,210
Oh, my god.

2948
01:55:18,270 --> 01:55:19,610
That was a fucking block.

2949
01:55:20,530 --> 01:55:22,850
I feel like a bird sometimes looking at this.

2950
01:55:24,690 --> 01:55:25,090
Shit.

2951
01:55:28,670 --> 01:55:30,090
Oh, I see a hard path.

2952
01:55:30,990 --> 01:55:31,570
Oh, my god.

2953
01:55:31,710 --> 01:55:32,450
I'm fucking...

2954
01:55:32,450 --> 01:55:34,390
I have like...

2955
01:55:35,010 --> 01:55:36,430
Three brain cells left in my head.

2956
01:55:36,690 --> 01:55:37,670
Oh, I see a thing up here.

2957
01:55:38,130 --> 01:55:39,370
Oh, that's so unlucky.

2958
01:55:39,550 --> 01:55:41,150
That's actually so fucking unlucky.

2959
01:55:41,710 --> 01:55:43,450
Dude, some people are walking back...

2960
01:55:43,450 --> 01:55:45,170
and it makes me feel like I'm literally going the wrong way.

2961
01:55:45,210 --> 01:55:45,890
I feel so stupid.

2962
01:55:47,130 --> 01:55:49,410
I did first place finish.

2963
01:55:50,230 --> 01:55:51,890
Oh, that's huge.

2964
01:55:52,610 --> 01:55:54,310
Wait, how many laps is this?

2965
01:55:59,110 --> 01:56:01,710
This will tell me if I'm going the wrong way, right?

2966
01:56:03,850 --> 01:56:05,950
It won't tell you if you're going the wrong way.

2967
01:56:06,430 --> 01:56:07,590
But you can tell, right?

2968
01:56:07,730 --> 01:56:10,790
There's arrows around the map that'll tell you what to do.

2969
01:56:11,750 --> 01:56:13,230
I'm Weenie Hut Jr-ing.

2970
01:56:14,910 --> 01:56:16,490
Yeah, you feel it, right?

2971
01:56:16,670 --> 01:56:17,290
Fuck that.

2972
01:56:17,770 --> 01:56:19,670
I was like, I messed up one of them...

2973
01:56:19,670 --> 01:56:21,390
and it respawns you to the other end.

2974
01:56:21,410 --> 01:56:22,890
And I'm like, it's Weenie Hut time.

2975
01:56:28,450 --> 01:56:29,550
There we go, there we go.

2976
01:56:30,090 --> 01:56:31,990
Okay, now I'm locked in.

2977
01:56:32,730 --> 01:56:34,770
I'm so confused sometimes.

2978
01:56:36,990 --> 01:56:37,770
Oh, shit.

2979
01:56:37,870 --> 01:56:38,550
I thought that was the path.

2980
01:56:38,690 --> 01:56:39,050
Goddamn.

2981
01:56:44,730 --> 01:56:46,070
Why did it jump me?

2982
01:56:46,090 --> 01:56:46,330
What?

2983
01:56:50,080 --> 01:56:50,800
Oh, God.

2984
01:56:50,920 --> 01:56:51,760
I'm hitting my head.

2985
01:56:59,240 --> 01:57:00,200
Easy path, bro.

2986
01:57:00,320 --> 01:57:00,980
Fuck this shit.

2987
01:57:02,700 --> 01:57:04,580
Nah, some of them are actually so hard.

2988
01:57:05,540 --> 01:57:06,440
Nevermind, no, you're right.

2989
01:57:06,500 --> 01:57:08,400
This is easier than the last map we did.

2990
01:57:09,380 --> 01:57:09,980
Yeah.

2991
01:57:15,940 --> 01:57:18,940
First place might be gone, but that's okay.

2992
01:57:21,760 --> 01:57:24,080
I'm at number three with the kids.

2993
01:57:24,360 --> 01:57:25,280
It's all good.

2994
01:57:27,380 --> 01:57:29,300
Sandwich Lord and Feinberg.

2995
01:57:29,460 --> 01:57:31,040
Of course, man!

2996
01:57:32,120 --> 01:57:33,440
What else would it be?

2997
01:57:35,120 --> 01:57:36,560
Do it, do it!

2998
01:57:36,560 --> 01:57:38,940
Wait, Wolfie, were you in San Diego?

2999
01:57:39,800 --> 01:57:40,080
No.

3000
01:57:41,200 --> 01:57:43,620
I'm EU, it's pretty far away, man.

3001
01:57:44,280 --> 01:57:45,260
I know, I was there, though.

3002
01:57:45,840 --> 01:57:46,440
Oh, oops.

3003
01:57:49,260 --> 01:57:51,320
Yeah, lap one finished, baby, let's go!

3004
01:57:53,200 --> 01:57:54,080
Lap two!

3005
01:57:57,140 --> 01:58:02,720
Hakka, just saying, you need to complete it, because they can actually kick you out if you don't complete it.

3006
01:58:02,720 --> 01:58:06,300
Oh no, you're going to complete it, it's fine.

3007
01:58:06,800 --> 01:58:07,960
I'm doing so well, bro.

3008
01:58:09,460 --> 01:58:10,760
Crazy, crazy, crazy.

3009
01:58:11,100 --> 01:58:12,040
I believe, Hakka, I believe.

3010
01:58:12,680 --> 01:58:15,140
I'm so good, I'm so good, insane.

3011
01:58:15,220 --> 01:58:15,940
I'm so glad you're here.

3012
01:58:16,660 --> 01:58:18,080
Bro, thank you, I appreciate that.

3013
01:58:18,280 --> 01:58:19,100
You made me feel so much better about myself.

3014
01:58:19,560 --> 01:58:22,500
Yeah, yeah, I'm happy to hear that.

3015
01:58:23,660 --> 01:58:24,680
That's actually crazy.

3016
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:25,580
That's mental.

3017
01:58:25,580 --> 01:58:26,180
Crazy.

3018
01:58:27,160 --> 01:58:31,600
I mean, when they really said Neo in the fucking promo image, they really meant it, you know?

3019
01:58:31,740 --> 01:58:33,240
Like, just saying, like...

3020
01:58:33,240 --> 01:58:36,740
Not just new to Block, or just new to Minecraft, honestly.

3021
01:58:36,980 --> 01:58:39,080
Yeah, bro, just new to fucking life in general.

3022
01:58:39,980 --> 01:58:40,700
Let's go!

3023
01:58:41,260 --> 01:58:42,520
I'm a weenie hut junior!

3024
01:58:46,540 --> 01:58:47,660
Fucking weenie hutting!

3025
01:58:48,560 --> 01:58:51,280
It's okay, bro, see, this is why I'm a Variety streamer, exactly.

3026
01:58:51,280 --> 01:58:51,700
Yeah.

3027
01:58:53,460 --> 01:58:54,940
Fuck them gaming shit, bro.

3028
01:58:55,180 --> 01:58:56,760
We can suck together.

3029
01:58:57,360 --> 01:58:57,920
Yeah, exactly.

3030
01:58:58,980 --> 01:58:59,240
Whoa.

3031
01:59:01,400 --> 01:59:01,920
Noor!

3032
01:59:03,080 --> 01:59:06,180
How do you activate the pink, by the way?

3033
01:59:06,640 --> 01:59:07,760
How do you activate...

3034
01:59:07,760 --> 01:59:09,420
How do you activate the pink stuff?

3035
01:59:10,040 --> 01:59:11,000
You just walk over it.

3036
01:59:11,160 --> 01:59:11,720
Oh, that's it?

3037
01:59:11,820 --> 01:59:12,040
Okay.

3038
01:59:12,940 --> 01:59:14,740
It's like the Sonic dash thingy.

3039
01:59:15,540 --> 01:59:18,240
Oh my fuck, that scared the shit out of me.

3040
01:59:18,640 --> 01:59:19,240
Bumble alert.

3041
01:59:19,860 --> 01:59:22,180
This one I won't cumble so hard again.

3042
01:59:23,120 --> 01:59:24,100
I've had like multiple generations.

3043
01:59:25,420 --> 01:59:27,080
Wait, what?

3044
01:59:27,120 --> 01:59:28,020
Why did it jump?

3045
01:59:28,140 --> 01:59:28,780
What the fuck?

3046
01:59:31,400 --> 01:59:35,300
I need Feinberg to fail a jump right now, preying on his downfall.

3047
01:59:35,320 --> 01:59:37,100
I need Feinberg to crash, please.

3048
01:59:37,620 --> 01:59:38,240
Oh my god.

3049
01:59:40,700 --> 01:59:41,660
Just kill them.

3050
01:59:42,340 --> 01:59:43,220
He failed a jump!

3051
01:59:43,480 --> 01:59:44,640
Wait, there's hope!

3052
01:59:45,340 --> 01:59:45,860
Huge!

3053
01:59:45,860 --> 01:59:46,740
Please!

3054
01:59:48,380 --> 01:59:49,400
Get first, Wolfie!

3055
01:59:49,880 --> 01:59:51,760
It's gonna be third, but...

3056
01:59:51,760 --> 01:59:53,280
Oh, that's still good.

3057
01:59:54,340 --> 01:59:55,780
That's almost like first.

3058
01:59:56,260 --> 01:59:57,180
That's still really good.

3059
01:59:58,080 --> 01:59:59,120
Oh, fuck!

3060
02:00:01,120 --> 02:00:01,920
Let's go!

3061
02:00:02,540 --> 02:00:03,880
Okay, I'll help you guys.

3062
02:00:05,400 --> 02:00:06,160
Okay, go to Haka.

3063
02:00:06,400 --> 02:00:06,960
Oh, shit.

3064
02:00:08,300 --> 02:00:09,380
Why did you make me go to Haka?

3065
02:00:09,460 --> 02:00:10,600
I was doing my fucking best!

3066
02:00:11,080 --> 02:00:12,500
He's here to help you!

3067
02:00:12,740 --> 02:00:14,000
That's what you meant!

3068
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:16,320
Do you not want to help?

3069
02:00:17,120 --> 02:00:17,600
No!

3070
02:00:17,960 --> 02:00:18,700
Where's Haka?

3071
02:00:18,980 --> 02:00:22,300
Okay, Haka, you got it.

3072
02:00:23,020 --> 02:00:24,160
Go onto the stone.

3073
02:00:24,320 --> 02:00:24,920
Yep, perfect.

3074
02:00:28,120 --> 02:00:30,280
And then just go for the green path.

3075
02:00:32,340 --> 02:00:34,620
Then you jump over and go right again.

3076
02:00:35,000 --> 02:00:35,440
Fine!

3077
02:00:35,820 --> 02:00:36,380
Yeah, just go right.

3078
02:00:37,960 --> 02:00:40,060
And then just go for the green again.

3079
02:00:40,300 --> 02:00:40,780
Yep, perfect.

3080
02:00:42,120 --> 02:00:42,920
Thanks, Wolfie.

3081
02:00:43,060 --> 02:00:43,420
You're welcome.

3082
02:00:45,040 --> 02:00:46,920
He didn't want that help earlier!

3083
02:00:47,160 --> 02:00:48,540
Was that not a good idea?

3084
02:00:49,900 --> 02:00:51,360
I don't need the fucking help!

3085
02:00:51,540 --> 02:00:52,240
I've done this!

3086
02:00:52,260 --> 02:00:53,180
This is my second lap!

3087
02:00:53,480 --> 02:00:55,240
Okay, now you're going to do it better.

3088
02:00:55,460 --> 02:00:56,200
It's an optimization.

3089
02:00:56,660 --> 02:00:57,520
True, true, true.

3090
02:00:57,660 --> 02:00:58,580
You're optimizing it.

3091
02:00:58,880 --> 02:01:00,400
Who else is close?

3092
02:01:00,440 --> 02:01:00,780
Let me see.

3093
02:01:00,960 --> 02:01:01,540
True, true, true.

3094
02:01:02,340 --> 02:01:03,160
I see Lionchu.

3095
02:01:03,620 --> 02:01:04,640
I see Doki.

3096
02:01:04,640 --> 02:01:05,480
I see Tom.

3097
02:01:05,800 --> 02:01:10,080
Weenie Hut Jr. I see Demma as well.

3098
02:01:10,400 --> 02:01:13,660
Weenie Hut Jr. Let's go, squad!

3099
02:01:15,020 --> 02:01:16,120
We're so ready, bro.

3100
02:01:16,260 --> 02:01:17,160
36, man.

3101
02:01:17,200 --> 02:01:17,900
At least not 48.

3102
02:01:17,980 --> 02:01:18,860
That's insane to me.

3103
02:01:19,580 --> 02:01:22,420
Okay, Weenie Hut Jr. time.

3104
02:01:22,900 --> 02:01:27,060
Weenie Hut Jr. I mean, fuck you all!

3105
02:01:27,680 --> 02:01:28,920
Fuck this boat, man.

3106
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:29,600
Fuck this boat.

3107
02:01:29,800 --> 02:01:30,580
What is happening?

3108
02:01:30,580 --> 02:01:30,760
That's insane.

3109
02:01:32,640 --> 02:01:35,440
I finished one fucking spot in front of me.

3110
02:01:35,440 --> 02:01:36,220
I went to Weenie Hut.

3111
02:01:36,260 --> 02:01:37,900
I got Weenie Hut Jr'd hard.

3112
02:01:39,100 --> 02:01:39,920
No, you're good.

3113
02:01:41,220 --> 02:01:42,300
Solid 21st.

3114
02:01:42,340 --> 02:01:42,580
That's good.

3115
02:01:44,160 --> 02:01:44,700
Yay!

3116
02:01:44,760 --> 02:01:47,600
I'm just scared to go the hard path with parkour.

3117
02:01:47,980 --> 02:01:48,760
You're good, Demma.

3118
02:01:48,860 --> 02:01:50,440
You're going to get like 25th.

3119
02:01:50,440 --> 02:01:50,980
That's perfect.

3120
02:01:52,800 --> 02:01:54,260
Love to see it.

3121
02:01:54,820 --> 02:01:59,080
I got fucked over at the very end and lost my 20th place.

3122
02:02:00,160 --> 02:02:02,440
We need these consistent placements.

3123
02:02:02,560 --> 02:02:03,500
We're doing good at this game.

3124
02:02:03,620 --> 02:02:04,200
We take this.

3125
02:02:04,240 --> 02:02:06,120
I think it's actually the best I've ever done in a race.

3126
02:02:07,180 --> 02:02:07,540
Yay!

3127
02:02:08,560 --> 02:02:09,120
Good job.

3128
02:02:09,340 --> 02:02:09,700
Fuck!

3129
02:02:11,040 --> 02:02:11,220
Yay!

3130
02:02:14,980 --> 02:02:15,340
Fuck!

3131
02:02:15,340 --> 02:02:17,300
You got this!

3132
02:02:17,960 --> 02:02:20,800
Wait, is she like ahead?

3133
02:02:21,400 --> 02:02:22,120
Or like a lap?

3134
02:02:23,600 --> 02:02:24,260
Who, Mega?

3135
02:02:24,500 --> 02:02:25,540
Yeah, or is she saved?

3136
02:02:25,540 --> 02:02:26,660
No, this is the same lap.

3137
02:02:26,800 --> 02:02:28,320
Okay, Haka, you got this.

3138
02:02:29,700 --> 02:02:31,160
Come on, go Haka!

3139
02:02:31,420 --> 02:02:32,240
We're watching you.

3140
02:02:32,680 --> 02:02:33,580
No pressure.

3141
02:02:35,060 --> 02:02:37,000
No pressure, we're watching you.

3142
02:02:37,180 --> 02:02:39,140
I'm watching you.

3143
02:02:39,400 --> 02:02:41,200
Yeah, we're all watching you.

3144
02:02:41,240 --> 02:02:44,740
All four of us are locked into you right now.

3145
02:02:44,920 --> 02:02:46,140
Yeah, you're going to go in front of her!

3146
02:02:47,360 --> 02:02:48,420
You got it.

3147
02:02:49,160 --> 02:02:49,640
Yes!

3148
02:02:50,700 --> 02:02:52,260
Yes, you can do this.

3149
02:02:54,280 --> 02:02:55,240
Just remember...

3150
02:02:55,240 --> 02:02:56,780
If you're ahead of her...

3151
02:02:56,780 --> 02:02:57,360
Keep sprint jumping.

3152
02:02:58,020 --> 02:02:59,760
Never stop, never stop.

3153
02:03:00,120 --> 02:03:01,400
You're going, you're going.

3154
02:03:01,460 --> 02:03:04,860
You're so ahead of her, but don't look back.

3155
02:03:05,060 --> 02:03:05,880
Don't look behind you.

3156
02:03:07,680 --> 02:03:08,860
You got this.

3157
02:03:09,040 --> 02:03:10,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

3158
02:03:10,860 --> 02:03:12,140
Go, go, go!

3159
02:03:12,280 --> 02:03:12,500
Beautiful.

3160
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:14,300
Go!

3161
02:03:16,760 --> 02:03:17,960
Do all of that.

3162
02:03:18,020 --> 02:03:18,940
She's a weenie hut junior.

3163
02:03:20,760 --> 02:03:21,240
Beautiful.

3164
02:03:21,920 --> 02:03:22,400
Nice!

3165
02:03:22,820 --> 02:03:23,080
To the right!

3166
02:03:24,400 --> 02:03:25,820
To the right!

3167
02:03:26,820 --> 02:03:28,560
Okay, same thing.

3168
02:03:28,680 --> 02:03:30,440
When you jump over, go to the right.

3169
02:03:31,400 --> 02:03:32,600
Yup, yup, yup.

3170
02:03:33,380 --> 02:03:34,660
Jump, jump, jump!

3171
02:03:34,660 --> 02:03:35,120
Jump running!

3172
02:03:36,960 --> 02:03:37,920
Someone fell.

3173
02:03:38,620 --> 02:03:39,420
Ignore them!

3174
02:03:39,660 --> 02:03:40,240
Who cares?

3175
02:03:40,380 --> 02:03:40,920
Oh my god, Peter!

3176
02:03:42,120 --> 02:03:42,880
Peter Griffin!

3177
02:03:44,300 --> 02:03:46,400
Okay, you got room to catch up maybe.

3178
02:03:47,940 --> 02:03:49,400
You gotta hook it, just jump!

3179
02:03:50,700 --> 02:03:51,900
You're ahead of two people!

3180
02:03:52,100 --> 02:03:52,940
You're ahead of two people!

3181
02:03:54,020 --> 02:03:56,580
Go at the bottom, go at the bottom!

3182
02:03:56,700 --> 02:03:57,260
Just keep going!

3183
02:03:58,120 --> 02:03:59,100
My stamina!

3184
02:03:59,720 --> 02:04:00,160
Nice!

3185
02:04:01,160 --> 02:04:01,760
Yay!

3186
02:04:03,660 --> 02:04:05,640
You're not last, you're not last!

3187
02:04:06,140 --> 02:04:07,040
I'm not last!

3188
02:04:07,520 --> 02:04:08,840
You did it!

3189
02:04:10,200 --> 02:04:10,880
Let's go!

3190
02:04:11,820 --> 02:04:12,820
Look at that!

3191
02:04:12,820 --> 02:04:14,880
What a fucking turnaround!

3192
02:04:16,460 --> 02:04:18,640
We gained a bunch of points here over Purple Team.

3193
02:04:18,720 --> 02:04:19,180
This is big.

3194
02:04:20,580 --> 02:04:21,900
That's fucking good!

3195
02:04:22,340 --> 02:04:23,740
Thanks, I appreciate it.

3196
02:04:23,780 --> 02:04:24,460
That makes me happy.

3197
02:04:24,900 --> 02:04:27,080
We did it guys, we did it.

3198
02:04:27,580 --> 02:04:29,480
We're so good, we're so good.

3199
02:04:29,720 --> 02:04:31,640
I beat Peter Griffin and to me that's a fucking win.

3200
02:04:31,640 --> 02:04:32,540
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3201
02:04:32,660 --> 02:04:33,060
That's a win.

3202
02:04:34,640 --> 02:04:36,400
You're gonna be the new Peter now.

3203
02:04:37,060 --> 02:04:39,380
Oh god, what am I watching?

3204
02:04:39,720 --> 02:04:40,280
Oh god.

3205
02:04:40,280 --> 02:04:41,760
Wait, is there more people?

3206
02:04:42,320 --> 02:04:43,420
Yeah, there's two more.

3207
02:04:44,200 --> 02:04:44,960
Wait, what?

3208
02:04:45,560 --> 02:04:47,660
Oh wait, you were on the previous lap?

3209
02:04:47,940 --> 02:04:49,620
Yeah, actually there's four left.

3210
02:04:50,260 --> 02:04:50,900
There's four left.

3211
02:04:52,380 --> 02:04:53,420
You're amazing.

3212
02:04:54,020 --> 02:04:55,740
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

3213
02:04:55,820 --> 02:04:57,520
This is interesting gameplay.

3214
02:04:57,820 --> 02:05:00,620
Wait, so Peter was like a map behind you?

3215
02:05:00,700 --> 02:05:02,160
Yeah, he was a map behind me.

3216
02:05:02,180 --> 02:05:03,220
Holy shit.

3217
02:05:04,400 --> 02:05:05,400
Okay, hold on.

3218
02:05:06,120 --> 02:05:07,940
What place is Groovy, huh?

3219
02:05:09,660 --> 02:05:10,180
Uh...

3220
02:05:10,180 --> 02:05:11,200
Um...

3221
02:05:11,200 --> 02:05:12,820
No, Groovy!

3222
02:05:16,140 --> 02:05:16,660
Um...

3223
02:05:16,660 --> 02:05:18,220
Oh, Parky just finished?

3224
02:05:18,520 --> 02:05:18,820
Huge.

3225
02:05:20,020 --> 02:05:21,880
Okay, have we got GrubChad?

3226
02:05:22,040 --> 02:05:22,500
I don't know.

3227
02:05:23,140 --> 02:05:24,720
I think GrubChad just subbed in.

3228
02:05:24,840 --> 02:05:25,340
Okay, perfect.

3229
02:05:25,600 --> 02:05:26,340
They're doing great.

3230
02:05:27,380 --> 02:05:29,400
Oh, that's the easy path.

3231
02:05:29,740 --> 02:05:30,440
Come on, Peter.

3232
02:05:30,580 --> 02:05:31,120
Come on, Peter.

3233
02:05:31,880 --> 02:05:33,060
All cheering for Peter Griffin.

3234
02:05:34,020 --> 02:05:34,340
Peter.

3235
02:05:35,080 --> 02:05:35,880
Hey, lowers.

3236
02:05:36,560 --> 02:05:37,000
Hey, lowers.

3237
02:05:39,840 --> 02:05:40,740
Let's go, top.

3238
02:05:41,720 --> 02:05:43,760
I don't know how they did that, but perfect.

3239
02:05:44,760 --> 02:05:45,440
They're doing great.

3240
02:05:45,800 --> 02:05:47,760
Wait, Peter's last?

3241
02:05:48,780 --> 02:05:50,080
Peter's last now.

3242
02:05:50,520 --> 02:05:52,000
Wait, is Peter last or is Groovy last?

3243
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:52,760
No, Groovy's last.

3244
02:05:52,900 --> 02:05:54,660
No, Groovy's ahead.

3245
02:05:54,720 --> 02:05:55,120
Groovy's ahead.

3246
02:05:55,220 --> 02:05:55,440
Never mind.

3247
02:05:55,520 --> 02:05:56,400
No, Groovy's ahead.

3248
02:05:56,520 --> 02:05:57,340
That's what I'm saying.

3249
02:05:57,560 --> 02:05:59,040
I was looking at Groovy being ahead.

3250
02:06:00,140 --> 02:06:01,020
Holy shit.

3251
02:06:01,020 --> 02:06:02,260
Hold on, let's go.

3252
02:06:02,940 --> 02:06:03,380
Perfect.

3253
02:06:04,780 --> 02:06:05,660
God damn.

3254
02:06:05,720 --> 02:06:07,040
What did Peter do?

3255
02:06:07,640 --> 02:06:09,280
What was he doing?

3256
02:06:11,780 --> 02:06:12,680
Let's go, Groovy.

3257
02:06:13,960 --> 02:06:15,440
Peter's about to exit the water.

3258
02:06:15,660 --> 02:06:16,060
Come on, Groovy.

3259
02:06:16,900 --> 02:06:18,560
Let them finish the race.

3260
02:06:18,720 --> 02:06:20,360
Let them finish the race.

3261
02:06:20,480 --> 02:06:21,300
I'm doing it with you, Groovy.

3262
02:06:21,420 --> 02:06:22,320
Come on, Groovy.

3263
02:06:24,320 --> 02:06:26,300
How did I do this last time?

3264
02:06:26,820 --> 02:06:27,200
Insane.

3265
02:06:27,960 --> 02:06:29,360
Come on, Groovy.

3266
02:06:29,780 --> 02:06:30,760
Jump, Groovy.

3267
02:06:31,160 --> 02:06:32,220
No, Groovy.

3268
02:06:33,160 --> 02:06:34,420
Fuck yeah.

3269
02:06:34,540 --> 02:06:35,140
Huge.

3270
02:06:35,780 --> 02:06:37,120
Wait, where's Peter?

3271
02:06:37,180 --> 02:06:38,640
Peter's right behind her.

3272
02:06:39,200 --> 02:06:40,900
Peter fucked up the slide.

3273
02:06:41,520 --> 02:06:43,120
I knew doing parkour challenged.

3274
02:06:44,160 --> 02:06:46,000
I got 25th place.

3275
02:06:46,860 --> 02:06:50,800
I think we had 19th, 21st, and 25th.

3276
02:06:52,080 --> 02:06:53,500
I got 17th.

3277
02:06:53,500 --> 02:06:54,600
Oh, I got 24th.

3278
02:06:54,600 --> 02:06:55,640
That's the highest I've ever gotten.

3279
02:06:58,340 --> 02:07:00,460
I don't understand this time.

3280
02:07:01,640 --> 02:07:03,000
How do you do this one?

3281
02:07:03,640 --> 02:07:04,900
Bob, just move closer.

3282
02:07:05,640 --> 02:07:07,540
Just move closer, please.

3283
02:07:07,880 --> 02:07:08,940
Oh, it's like that.

3284
02:07:09,460 --> 02:07:10,580
Nice, nice.

3285
02:07:12,420 --> 02:07:13,300
Come on, Peter.

3286
02:07:13,540 --> 02:07:15,220
Just do weenie hut.

3287
02:07:15,680 --> 02:07:19,880
Somehow, this makes me feel better about myself.

3288
02:07:20,820 --> 02:07:24,080
I don't understand how to do the hard part of this one.

3289
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:29,280
It's like harder jumps and then the launch pad goes to the extended...

3290
02:07:29,280 --> 02:07:29,880
Come on, Groovy.

3291
02:07:30,620 --> 02:07:31,520
Go, Groovy.

3292
02:07:31,700 --> 02:07:33,040
I believe in you, Groovy.

3293
02:07:33,760 --> 02:07:34,940
10 seconds, Groovy.

3294
02:07:36,100 --> 02:07:37,380
10 seconds, Groovy.

3295
02:07:37,540 --> 02:07:38,200
No, Groovy.

3296
02:07:38,480 --> 02:07:39,400
They're just hard jumps.

3297
02:07:41,100 --> 02:07:42,580
Is Bob gonna finish?

3298
02:07:43,620 --> 02:07:44,220
So close.

3299
02:07:44,320 --> 02:07:46,640
Do you get points if you finish?

3300
02:07:46,740 --> 02:07:47,500
Or if you don't finish?

3301
02:07:47,800 --> 02:07:51,280
You still get points for the laps, so Groovy will get some points.

3302
02:07:51,960 --> 02:07:52,760
Peter did it.

3303
02:07:54,880 --> 02:07:56,520
I can't believe I got 17th.

3304
02:07:56,540 --> 02:07:57,260
I've never gotten that high.

3305
02:07:57,880 --> 02:07:59,380
Okay, let's go.

3306
02:07:59,420 --> 02:07:59,940
Breakdown time.

3307
02:08:01,220 --> 02:08:01,800
My goat.

3308
02:08:02,360 --> 02:08:02,940
This will be big.

3309
02:08:03,800 --> 02:08:05,140
Peter Griffin and my goat.

3310
02:08:05,980 --> 02:08:06,900
Let's go.

3311
02:08:07,640 --> 02:08:09,000
36 plays, baby.

3312
02:08:09,240 --> 02:08:10,200
Let's go, baby.

3313
02:08:11,960 --> 02:08:12,480
Huge.

3314
02:08:13,420 --> 02:08:13,940
Huge.

3315
02:08:15,860 --> 02:08:16,780
Feinberg noob.

3316
02:08:16,780 --> 02:08:18,880
Beaten by not even half a second.

3317
02:08:19,320 --> 02:08:20,580
Fastest lap.

3318
02:08:22,720 --> 02:08:23,800
Oh my god, sleepy.

3319
02:08:24,340 --> 02:08:26,140
Yeah, I saw that.

3320
02:08:26,900 --> 02:08:28,320
Is this the biggest lap improvement?

3321
02:08:29,560 --> 02:08:30,740
Sixth placement.

3322
02:08:33,120 --> 02:08:33,720
Huge.

3323
02:08:34,980 --> 02:08:36,440
A light second.

3324
02:08:36,700 --> 02:08:37,260
We take it.

3325
02:08:38,320 --> 02:08:39,500
We take it.

3326
02:08:40,840 --> 02:08:41,640
Oh, he went up as well.

3327
02:08:42,900 --> 02:08:44,100
Sixth place.

3328
02:08:44,100 --> 02:08:45,700
Let's go.

3329
02:08:45,900 --> 02:08:49,100
Now there's multipliers.

3330
02:08:49,960 --> 02:08:51,980
How many games left now?

3331
02:08:52,080 --> 02:08:52,660
We can get third.

3332
02:08:55,780 --> 02:08:57,040
Really hard.

3333
02:08:57,520 --> 02:08:58,660
We can get third place.

3334
02:09:00,800 --> 02:09:02,580
Not even the finals.

3335
02:09:03,500 --> 02:09:04,400
Third place.

3336
02:09:04,840 --> 02:09:06,680
You still have to watch.

3337
02:09:08,940 --> 02:09:11,360
Nobody remembers third.

3338
02:09:11,360 --> 02:09:12,800
It was me.

3339
02:09:14,540 --> 02:09:16,660
I'm so close.

3340
02:09:16,800 --> 02:09:19,760
My first proper block course, I got 40th.

3341
02:09:21,180 --> 02:09:23,420
It's just off from here.

3342
02:09:23,480 --> 02:09:24,220
It's going to go crazy.

3343
02:09:25,020 --> 02:09:26,940
You literally can't do worse.

3344
02:09:27,020 --> 02:09:27,900
You're good.

3345
02:09:31,820 --> 02:09:34,640
You can catch up technically.

3346
02:09:35,060 --> 02:09:35,740
You can.

3347
02:09:36,700 --> 02:09:37,220
Yeah?

3348
02:09:38,560 --> 02:09:40,620
I think you can catch up.

3349
02:09:40,940 --> 02:09:41,660
It's possible.

3350
02:09:45,020 --> 02:09:46,020
It's possible.

3351
02:09:47,320 --> 02:09:49,100
I believe so hard.

3352
02:09:49,220 --> 02:09:49,560
Thank you.

3353
02:09:50,580 --> 02:09:52,280
You guys honor me.

3354
02:09:52,360 --> 02:09:53,380
You guys make me feel better.

3355
02:09:54,940 --> 02:09:57,500
If you win, I'll give you...

3356
02:09:57,500 --> 02:09:59,160
One of them believes in me.

3357
02:09:59,260 --> 02:10:00,540
One of them almost made me dox myself.

3358
02:10:00,560 --> 02:10:02,860
If you get 35th place, I'll give you 10 subs.

3359
02:10:02,860 --> 02:10:04,520
I'll give you one sub.

3360
02:10:04,680 --> 02:10:05,400
This is a dream.

3361
02:10:06,180 --> 02:10:10,060
If you get above 40th, I'll give you one sub.

3362
02:10:10,440 --> 02:10:12,100
We'll all give you one sub.

3363
02:10:12,900 --> 02:10:14,900
All is in those two.

3364
02:10:15,980 --> 02:10:17,660
I'll give you a sub for each.

3365
02:10:17,660 --> 02:10:18,880
Don't use the cheaper deck.

3366
02:10:20,960 --> 02:10:21,520
Because...

3367
02:10:21,520 --> 02:10:22,560
I was going to say...

3368
02:10:22,560 --> 02:10:25,620
A sub is like subscribing to a channel.

3369
02:10:25,840 --> 02:10:26,460
In YouTube.

3370
02:10:27,320 --> 02:10:29,120
You did catch that.

3371
02:10:29,440 --> 02:10:30,380
I was like...

3372
02:10:32,780 --> 02:10:33,500
My bad.

3373
02:10:34,540 --> 02:10:36,280
Once you move up, I'll give you a sub.

3374
02:10:36,360 --> 02:10:37,860
I'll make a new account and subscribe to you.

3375
02:10:38,860 --> 02:10:40,440
He's just going to subscribe to you.

3376
02:10:41,120 --> 02:10:41,700
I'll give you a sub.

3377
02:10:41,860 --> 02:10:42,440
I'll give you a subscriber.

3378
02:10:43,900 --> 02:10:45,580
I'll give you a membership.

3379
02:10:46,040 --> 02:10:46,460
Thank you.

3380
02:10:48,060 --> 02:10:49,620
Don't keep her subscribed to my channel.

3381
02:10:49,900 --> 02:10:50,260
Insane.

3382
02:10:52,620 --> 02:10:53,340
Don't worry.

3383
02:10:53,480 --> 02:10:54,420
I didn't.

3384
02:10:55,580 --> 02:11:02,000
LOL But if you're not last place...

3385
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:03,740
I will subscribe to your channel.

3386
02:11:04,180 --> 02:11:06,640
If you get out of 40th place...

3387
02:11:06,640 --> 02:11:07,760
I'll subscribe to your channel.

3388
02:11:08,540 --> 02:11:08,760
Wow.

3389
02:11:09,240 --> 02:11:10,340
Trailblazers is what we vote for.

3390
02:11:10,480 --> 02:11:12,940
Why is my cat sliding his butt across the floor?

3391
02:11:13,280 --> 02:11:13,560
Dude.

3392
02:11:14,420 --> 02:11:14,940
Stop.

3393
02:11:16,100 --> 02:11:16,620
Wait.

3394
02:11:16,680 --> 02:11:17,140
What's this?

3395
02:11:17,360 --> 02:11:17,880
Trailblazers?

3396
02:11:18,080 --> 02:11:19,160
Which one is Trailblazers?

3397
02:11:20,620 --> 02:11:22,620
We didn't play this last time.

3398
02:11:22,620 --> 02:11:24,940
This is parkour and stuff.

3399
02:11:25,040 --> 02:11:25,520
Wait.

3400
02:11:25,620 --> 02:11:26,460
Another parkour?

3401
02:11:26,700 --> 02:11:27,520
I just got bombed.

3402
02:11:27,900 --> 02:11:31,220
This one has different movement types.

3403
02:11:31,340 --> 02:11:34,520
It's like parkour, dropper, and elytra.

3404
02:11:35,220 --> 02:11:35,800
Oh god.

3405
02:11:35,900 --> 02:11:36,460
We're so fucked.

3406
02:11:36,560 --> 02:11:37,500
There's a bunch of different ones.

3407
02:11:37,560 --> 02:11:38,120
It's all optional.

3408
02:11:38,480 --> 02:11:39,000
Oh, okay.

3409
02:11:39,300 --> 02:11:40,620
So there's hard mode...

3410
02:11:40,620 --> 02:11:41,980
and easy mode type deal.

3411
02:11:42,620 --> 02:11:43,960
There's one, two, three...

3412
02:11:43,960 --> 02:11:44,820
There's three games left.

3413
02:11:46,200 --> 02:11:47,700
This is when the multipliers start.

3414
02:11:47,840 --> 02:11:50,300
So this is when comeback potential is peak.

3415
02:11:50,300 --> 02:11:52,600
Guys, we are comebacking so hard.

3416
02:11:52,880 --> 02:11:53,660
It's so real.

3417
02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:54,520
Okay.

3418
02:11:56,780 --> 02:11:58,320
Lock the fuck in.

3419
02:11:58,680 --> 02:11:59,840
We are coming back huge.

3420
02:12:01,720 --> 02:12:02,760
Okay, so...

3421
02:12:02,760 --> 02:12:03,580
It'll explain it.

3422
02:12:04,040 --> 02:12:06,480
There's two types of movement.

3423
02:12:06,840 --> 02:12:10,140
There's one where your goal is to just complete it no matter what.

3424
02:12:10,360 --> 02:12:11,520
Oh, I love the full one!

3425
02:12:12,020 --> 02:12:12,800
Yeah, dropper.

3426
02:12:13,580 --> 02:12:17,260
There's also one where the goal is to do it as fast as possible.

3427
02:12:17,880 --> 02:12:21,400
I don't know what the comp is going to be like for this.

3428
02:12:21,540 --> 02:12:24,180
I have no clue who's good at parkour, who's not good at parkour.

3429
02:12:24,540 --> 02:12:25,560
So just do whatever you want.

3430
02:12:26,360 --> 02:12:26,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3431
02:12:27,080 --> 02:12:29,340
Dropper is the easiest probably if you do like the...

3432
02:12:30,240 --> 02:12:32,960
I think you guys could probably do like the middle courses.

3433
02:12:33,100 --> 02:12:34,040
I feel like Electro would also be like...

3434
02:12:34,040 --> 02:12:35,440
I don't know which one it is.

3435
02:12:35,440 --> 02:12:36,160
I'm confused.

3436
02:12:36,280 --> 02:12:38,220
So we have to finish each of them ourselves?

3437
02:12:38,620 --> 02:12:39,300
Or just one?

3438
02:12:39,600 --> 02:12:40,040
Just try.

3439
02:12:40,140 --> 02:12:42,780
Just try to finish the best you can and stuff.

3440
02:12:42,920 --> 02:12:44,060
Oh, we have to finish them all.

3441
02:12:44,480 --> 02:12:45,540
You don't have to finish...

3442
02:12:45,540 --> 02:12:48,060
Finish them as much as you can pretty much.

3443
02:12:48,140 --> 02:12:49,520
As much as you would like.

3444
02:12:49,900 --> 02:12:52,000
So start with what you're comfortable with.

3445
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:55,920
So like if you did dropper and I did dropper, it'll just get whoever has the best time?

3446
02:12:56,020 --> 02:12:56,260
It's fine.

3447
02:12:56,620 --> 02:12:58,640
Both of us will get it.

3448
02:12:58,760 --> 02:13:01,620
So just get whatever you're super comfortable with.

3449
02:13:02,360 --> 02:13:05,160
I'm going to do the time trials because there's bonuses for that.

3450
02:13:05,780 --> 02:13:07,360
You guys, I would do like droppers.

3451
02:13:07,540 --> 02:13:09,220
The skill level has been brought down.

3452
02:13:09,220 --> 02:13:11,740
So you can try like intermediates I think should be fine.

3453
02:13:11,880 --> 02:13:13,160
You can try like Electro as well.

3454
02:13:13,160 --> 02:13:14,940
Can we do intermediate and then go like...

3455
02:13:14,940 --> 02:13:17,980
Like do we get points if we do intermediate and advanced?

3456
02:13:18,080 --> 02:13:18,820
Or just one of them?

3457
02:13:19,220 --> 02:13:20,180
Yeah, you can just do...

3458
02:13:20,180 --> 02:13:21,760
There's multiple levels per hold.

3459
02:13:21,940 --> 02:13:23,500
All of them and get points for all of them?

3460
02:13:23,860 --> 02:13:25,520
Yeah, there's multiple levels per hold.

3461
02:13:27,380 --> 02:13:28,140
Try this.

3462
02:13:28,480 --> 02:13:29,860
Come on, intermediate dropper, baby!

3463
02:13:30,060 --> 02:13:33,140
If there's any questions, just shout and I will try it.

3464
02:13:33,640 --> 02:13:35,260
What the fuck is this?

3465
02:13:35,460 --> 02:13:36,540
I'm so confused.

3466
02:13:37,100 --> 02:13:39,240
Wait, where do we drop on?

3467
02:13:40,320 --> 02:13:41,800
You have to land in water.

3468
02:13:42,580 --> 02:13:43,420
Land in water, yeah.

3469
02:13:44,780 --> 02:13:45,220
Oh!

3470
02:13:45,320 --> 02:13:46,420
Okay, yeah, that's...

3471
02:13:46,420 --> 02:13:48,160
I needed that explanation.

3472
02:13:48,880 --> 02:13:50,180
Oh, okay.

3473
02:13:50,460 --> 02:13:53,020
Because I was like, where are we supposed to drop?

3474
02:13:54,040 --> 02:13:56,220
Okay, dropping dropper is hard.

3475
02:13:56,840 --> 02:13:57,820
Alright, who should drop TipTip?

3476
02:13:58,700 --> 02:13:59,760
Oh shit, okay.

3477
02:14:00,480 --> 02:14:01,560
Yeah, I'm down.

3478
02:14:02,320 --> 02:14:03,340
I keep hitting things!

3479
02:14:03,440 --> 02:14:04,400
I'm going to scream.

3480
02:14:04,600 --> 02:14:05,180
How do we leave?

3481
02:14:05,220 --> 02:14:06,220
I don't want to do this one.

3482
02:14:06,780 --> 02:14:09,540
There should be a button in your inventory where you can leave.

3483
02:14:09,640 --> 02:14:11,220
It should be like the red door thing.

3484
02:14:11,220 --> 02:14:12,700
Oh shit, wait, no.

3485
02:14:12,820 --> 02:14:13,140
I'm so tired.

3486
02:14:14,360 --> 02:14:15,400
Where am I?

3487
02:14:16,100 --> 02:14:16,980
I get it now.

3488
02:14:17,240 --> 02:14:20,320
Why does it keep on making me go through the fucking parkour one?

3489
02:14:21,180 --> 02:14:22,540
Are you jumping in the parkour?

3490
02:14:23,280 --> 02:14:25,220
Accidentally, it keeps on like, putting me back.

3491
02:14:25,760 --> 02:14:26,100
Ah, I see.

3492
02:14:26,500 --> 02:14:27,520
Ah shit, okay.

3493
02:14:28,940 --> 02:14:29,560
This is difficult.

3494
02:14:30,800 --> 02:14:31,240
What?

3495
02:14:32,300 --> 02:14:34,420
So, how's your guys' day going?

3496
02:14:35,220 --> 02:14:35,980
Pretty good, yeah.

3497
02:14:36,800 --> 02:14:39,420
It's pretty cold, I'm literally boating on top of ice right now.

3498
02:14:39,420 --> 02:14:41,120
But, you know, for the rest it's been great.

3499
02:14:41,860 --> 02:14:43,420
I'm fucking good at ice boating!

3500
02:14:43,860 --> 02:14:46,140
Why is the gold fucking course like even...

3501
02:14:46,140 --> 02:14:46,760
Bro, what the fuck?

3502
02:14:46,840 --> 02:14:48,140
Yeah, fuck this dropper thing.

3503
02:14:48,220 --> 02:14:50,200
Yeah, no, the dropper was hard.

3504
02:14:51,040 --> 02:14:51,780
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3505
02:14:52,680 --> 02:14:54,320
Let's go to Lichen, that shit, man.

3506
02:14:55,740 --> 02:14:57,040
Let me try an easier dropper.

3507
02:14:57,140 --> 02:14:57,780
Let's see, let's see.

3508
02:14:57,960 --> 02:14:58,640
No, too easy.

3509
02:14:58,760 --> 02:15:00,420
Easy is very easy.

3510
02:15:01,480 --> 02:15:02,640
Is it too easy?

3511
02:15:02,780 --> 02:15:03,260
Oh shit.

3512
02:15:04,600 --> 02:15:06,060
How come there's three check marks?

3513
02:15:06,200 --> 02:15:07,060
Can you do it again and again?

3514
02:15:09,200 --> 02:15:09,600
Uh...

3515
02:15:09,600 --> 02:15:10,860
Oh, it really isn't that easy, huh?

3516
02:15:11,240 --> 02:15:12,440
There's multiple levels, sorry.

3517
02:15:13,400 --> 02:15:14,580
Wait, what?

3518
02:15:14,620 --> 02:15:15,660
Actually, fucking Triton.

3519
02:15:15,740 --> 02:15:16,420
I like Triton.

3520
02:15:17,160 --> 02:15:18,100
Can you do it in parkour?

3521
02:15:18,980 --> 02:15:19,480
Hell yeah.

3522
02:15:21,280 --> 02:15:22,800
Oh my god, this is crazy.

3523
02:15:22,800 --> 02:15:25,540
Course 3, yeah, we fucking ball, bro.

3524
02:15:25,580 --> 02:15:26,040
Oh my gosh.

3525
02:15:27,240 --> 02:15:28,520
These are, like, really hard.

3526
02:15:28,520 --> 02:15:29,220
What the fuck?

3527
02:15:29,380 --> 02:15:31,000
I thought it was a pole-ass pole!

3528
02:15:31,240 --> 02:15:32,660
Not just a fucking thing.

3529
02:15:32,660 --> 02:15:32,700
Okay.

3530
02:15:35,680 --> 02:15:36,520
Okay, there we go.

3531
02:15:37,100 --> 02:15:38,560
Oh, that is hard.

3532
02:15:40,680 --> 02:15:41,560
Oh shit.

3533
02:15:42,180 --> 02:15:44,020
The parkour is hard, too.

3534
02:15:45,220 --> 02:15:45,840
The intermediate one.

3535
02:15:45,840 --> 02:15:47,500
Yeah, I don't like doing the parkour, that shit is hard.

3536
02:15:49,240 --> 02:15:51,200
I think I need one more.

3537
02:15:51,740 --> 02:15:51,740
Fuck!

3538
02:15:52,020 --> 02:15:52,600
God damn.

3539
02:15:56,840 --> 02:15:59,400
I can't do the last jump for this one.

3540
02:16:02,200 --> 02:16:03,920
Which difficulty are you guys going for right now?

3541
02:16:03,940 --> 02:16:05,060
Intermediate parkour.

3542
02:16:06,220 --> 02:16:07,620
I'm doing the dropper.

3543
02:16:09,160 --> 02:16:10,120
I think...

3544
02:16:10,120 --> 02:16:12,800
Yeah, if it's too hard, you can just leave and you can try one lower.

3545
02:16:13,100 --> 02:16:14,240
I did the expert for droppers.

3546
02:16:14,840 --> 02:16:15,180
Perfect.

3547
02:16:15,460 --> 02:16:16,860
I'll do one more and then...

3548
02:16:16,860 --> 02:16:18,140
Ah, fuck!

3549
02:16:18,960 --> 02:16:22,160
I don't know exactly, like, how hard everything is.

3550
02:16:22,220 --> 02:16:22,940
I'm just trying to...

3551
02:16:22,940 --> 02:16:24,260
Yeah, this one.

3552
02:16:24,640 --> 02:16:26,040
Some of these are really hard.

3553
02:16:26,280 --> 02:16:27,200
God damn, yeah.

3554
02:16:27,900 --> 02:16:28,820
That makes sense.

3555
02:16:29,400 --> 02:16:33,540
Even, like, intermediate is super hard for a beginner.

3556
02:16:36,060 --> 02:16:37,420
Or, like, for a rookie player.

3557
02:16:37,720 --> 02:16:39,220
And, like, I do a lot of parkour, too.

3558
02:16:39,360 --> 02:16:41,200
So, it's like...

3559
02:16:42,940 --> 02:16:44,600
Yeah, don't get, like, a parkour citizen, bro.

3560
02:16:44,640 --> 02:16:45,240
It's kind of crazy.

3561
02:16:46,780 --> 02:16:48,120
I don't think I can do this.

3562
02:16:49,040 --> 02:16:50,020
This one's fucking hard.

3563
02:16:50,160 --> 02:16:50,640
Holy shit.

3564
02:16:53,140 --> 02:16:54,300
Let me go...

3565
02:16:55,240 --> 02:16:55,680
Uh...

3566
02:16:55,680 --> 02:16:57,760
Try it again, but probably the first...

3567
02:16:57,760 --> 02:16:58,580
Course 2?

3568
02:16:59,220 --> 02:16:59,960
No way.

3569
02:17:02,020 --> 02:17:04,300
I don't think I can do the fucking Electra.

3570
02:17:05,460 --> 02:17:07,020
I'm just doing the beginner one.

3571
02:17:10,300 --> 02:17:10,940
Oh, shit.

3572
02:17:11,060 --> 02:17:11,260
Okay.

3573
02:17:11,460 --> 02:17:11,700
Hold on.

3574
02:17:12,260 --> 02:17:13,380
Oh, I'm just fucking up entirely.

3575
02:17:13,520 --> 02:17:15,840
I'm just gonna do all the beginner ones just for the points.

3576
02:17:18,060 --> 02:17:20,600
I just realized I should've just done that instead.

3577
02:17:21,020 --> 02:17:22,740
What the fuck I was doing earlier.

3578
02:17:29,180 --> 02:17:33,120
Yeah, this one is just kind of going for whatever you're most comfortable with.

3579
02:17:34,260 --> 02:17:36,000
Goddamn, I'm jumping too hard.

3580
02:17:36,420 --> 02:17:37,580
Kind of just explore.

3581
02:17:38,400 --> 02:17:38,880
Whoops.

3582
02:17:41,540 --> 02:17:43,640
This is for you to realize what you're good at, basically.

3583
02:17:45,440 --> 02:17:46,920
Oh my god.

3584
02:17:52,330 --> 02:17:53,610
Guys, I'm so sorry.

3585
02:17:53,610 --> 02:17:54,330
I can actually aim for this one.

3586
02:17:54,430 --> 02:17:59,190
But doing the dropper makes me, like, do movements in real life.

3587
02:17:59,190 --> 02:18:02,010
No, same, same, same.

3588
02:18:02,190 --> 02:18:03,110
I literally jumped too.

3589
02:18:05,090 --> 02:18:06,230
I completed 10 already.

3590
02:18:06,870 --> 02:18:07,450
Nice.

3591
02:18:09,150 --> 02:18:11,170
I'm just farming Electra right now.

3592
02:18:11,510 --> 02:18:14,950
I think intermediate is pretty doable.

3593
02:18:17,270 --> 02:18:18,370
For, like, everybody.

3594
02:18:18,570 --> 02:18:18,870
Goddamn.

3595
02:18:19,530 --> 02:18:21,070
What the fuck just happened?

3596
02:18:21,670 --> 02:18:22,970
Oh my god.

3597
02:18:23,070 --> 02:18:23,650
Beginner?

3598
02:18:23,770 --> 02:18:24,470
Electra?

3599
02:18:24,910 --> 02:18:27,550
This is crazy.

3600
02:18:27,550 --> 02:18:28,950
Okay, no, this is not it.

3601
02:18:29,030 --> 02:18:29,490
This is not it.

3602
02:18:30,030 --> 02:18:30,990
No way, no way.

3603
02:18:31,690 --> 02:18:35,130
I think this is my first time hitting this, too.

3604
02:18:36,990 --> 02:18:37,410
Oh,

3605
02:18:41,530 --> 02:18:43,530
wow, we still have, like, 7 minutes left.

3606
02:18:43,630 --> 02:18:44,310
What the fuck?

3607
02:18:44,610 --> 02:18:45,770
Yeah, it's pretty generous, huh?

3608
02:18:46,050 --> 02:18:48,250
There's a lot of room to play.

3609
02:18:49,090 --> 02:18:49,570
Oh, okay.

3610
02:18:50,030 --> 02:18:52,230
Guys, I've never done Trident before.

3611
02:18:53,510 --> 02:18:54,990
Trident's fun, it's just hard.

3612
02:18:54,990 --> 02:18:59,590
Yeah, I normally don't even use Trident for regular Minecraft.

3613
02:19:01,030 --> 02:19:02,030
What's obstacles?

3614
02:19:02,670 --> 02:19:03,710
That's, like, block placing.

3615
02:19:04,630 --> 02:19:05,610
Block placing?

3616
02:19:05,770 --> 02:19:06,230
Aim high?

3617
02:19:06,530 --> 02:19:09,530
Place blocks to go across, like, a course.

3618
02:19:10,910 --> 02:19:13,110
I think that one might be a little tricky.

3619
02:19:13,510 --> 02:19:13,510
What?

3620
02:19:13,790 --> 02:19:14,190
Okay.

3621
02:19:14,190 --> 02:19:16,290
I'll do, like, one more of this.

3622
02:19:17,610 --> 02:19:20,130
I would recommend doing the easier parkours.

3623
02:19:20,230 --> 02:19:22,530
Maybe, like, the intermediates I think could be good.

3624
02:19:22,530 --> 02:19:23,070
Oh, fuck.

3625
02:19:25,670 --> 02:19:26,950
Okay, a lot of intermediates.

3626
02:19:27,030 --> 02:19:27,750
I think I can do advanced.

3627
02:19:29,010 --> 02:19:29,250
Alright.

3628
02:19:29,950 --> 02:19:30,970
How's there more?

3629
02:19:33,350 --> 02:19:34,310
Wait, what?

3630
02:19:34,470 --> 02:19:35,430
Oh, it's over here.

3631
02:19:35,790 --> 02:19:37,430
The music's banger, though.

3632
02:19:37,910 --> 02:19:40,090
I'm, like, in love with the fucking soundtrack.

3633
02:19:40,170 --> 02:19:40,790
It's really good.

3634
02:19:41,390 --> 02:19:42,950
A lot of work put into it.

3635
02:19:44,070 --> 02:19:46,030
Oh, that was... okay.

3636
02:19:46,350 --> 02:19:46,910
I did advanced.

3637
02:19:48,490 --> 02:19:53,690
I just... I can't really, like, gauge easily how hard something is.

3638
02:19:54,410 --> 02:19:55,250
I think...

3639
02:19:55,250 --> 02:19:57,370
I'm just simply too good.

3640
02:19:58,090 --> 02:19:59,270
Okay, that's not what I meant.

3641
02:20:00,710 --> 02:20:02,590
Yeah, I think, like...

3642
02:20:02,590 --> 02:20:10,490
I think if I played this again, I'd definitely be better, but, like, as a person who hasn't played it before, it's definitely, like...

3643
02:20:10,490 --> 02:20:11,290
Okay, advanced on.

3644
02:20:11,610 --> 02:20:14,630
The non-beginner ones are really difficult.

3645
02:20:14,810 --> 02:20:15,410
This is hard.

3646
02:20:16,410 --> 02:20:19,150
All the non-beginner ones are really difficult.

3647
02:20:20,430 --> 02:20:21,590
You can farm the EZs.

3648
02:20:21,650 --> 02:20:21,930
I think...

3649
02:20:21,930 --> 02:20:26,230
I think that's just me not knowing the rules of it, too.

3650
02:20:26,330 --> 02:20:26,910
What's obstacle?

3651
02:20:28,030 --> 02:20:28,590
Block placing.

3652
02:20:29,090 --> 02:20:30,610
Yeah, I really want to participate again.

3653
02:20:30,670 --> 02:20:31,170
This shit's fun.

3654
02:20:31,790 --> 02:20:33,550
Oh my god, fuck me.

3655
02:20:34,010 --> 02:20:34,530
Sorry, sorry.

3656
02:20:37,070 --> 02:20:38,330
Oh my gosh.

3657
02:20:38,570 --> 02:20:40,210
Demi doesn't want Haka to play again.

3658
02:20:40,290 --> 02:20:41,630
Demi's like, no, please!

3659
02:20:42,370 --> 02:20:43,350
Fuck, not again!

3660
02:20:43,430 --> 02:20:44,190
Not this guy again!

3661
02:20:44,530 --> 02:20:46,050
Oh my god, I keep fucking up!

3662
02:20:46,050 --> 02:20:46,850
I'm actually gonna lose.

3663
02:20:46,890 --> 02:20:48,110
Oh, we're fourth place, EP?

3664
02:20:50,810 --> 02:20:52,030
Me going through it.

3665
02:20:53,970 --> 02:20:56,430
Oh, block placement is...

3666
02:20:56,430 --> 02:20:57,070
What?

3667
02:20:58,930 --> 02:21:00,570
Yeah, you have to place the block.

3668
02:21:01,690 --> 02:21:03,210
I hear a yay, that's good.

3669
02:21:04,450 --> 02:21:05,910
Okay, we're going up a lot.

3670
02:21:06,530 --> 02:21:08,570
I'm farming parkour right now.

3671
02:21:10,690 --> 02:21:11,590
He's doing everything.

3672
02:21:13,490 --> 02:21:13,970
Wow!

3673
02:21:13,970 --> 02:21:16,030
And you're so humble.

3674
02:21:17,210 --> 02:21:18,390
Sorry, my bad.

3675
02:21:18,730 --> 02:21:19,670
Nah, it's okay.

3676
02:21:20,190 --> 02:21:21,890
Jesus Christ.

3677
02:21:22,030 --> 02:21:23,690
I'm just that good.

3678
02:21:24,250 --> 02:21:24,850
Team effort.

3679
02:21:25,490 --> 02:21:27,510
I'm just doing a lot of effort.

3680
02:21:27,510 --> 02:21:28,210
Let's go, baby!

3681
02:21:29,530 --> 02:21:31,090
17 completed, let's go.

3682
02:21:31,490 --> 02:21:33,630
Bro, I'm so getting that doki sub, bro, it's insane.

3683
02:21:35,790 --> 02:21:37,070
This fucking guy.

3684
02:21:37,510 --> 02:21:39,150
I'm so getting that doki sub, bro.

3685
02:21:39,390 --> 02:21:40,250
I'm so ready.

3686
02:21:40,250 --> 02:21:41,050
Ah!

3687
02:21:42,250 --> 02:21:44,150
I've never done these block placements before.

3688
02:21:44,330 --> 02:21:46,470
It's such a weird mechanic.

3689
02:21:47,690 --> 02:21:48,030
Yeah.

3690
02:21:48,250 --> 02:21:51,450
They're pretty niche to just event stuff.

3691
02:21:51,830 --> 02:21:52,570
I did all the parkour.

3692
02:21:53,550 --> 02:21:57,650
There's some gold courses as well, which spawn in the middle of the map.

3693
02:21:57,650 --> 02:21:59,150
I guess I'm just going to go for...

3694
02:21:59,830 --> 02:22:03,810
Yeah, I think you could probably do that, because I think it's like intermediate.

3695
02:22:04,930 --> 02:22:05,650
So it should be easy.

3696
02:22:05,650 --> 02:22:06,970
You know what, I'm going to try the dropper again.

3697
02:22:08,110 --> 02:22:09,350
Dropper is really easy.

3698
02:22:10,010 --> 02:22:11,650
Just move your thingy to like...

3699
02:22:14,330 --> 02:22:17,870
Just make your FOV 30 and you should be fine.

3700
02:22:18,630 --> 02:22:18,890
Okay.

3701
02:22:19,350 --> 02:22:19,870
Hacks?

3702
02:22:21,170 --> 02:22:22,450
No, this is strats.

3703
02:22:24,530 --> 02:22:25,870
Oh my god.

3704
02:22:26,030 --> 02:22:28,090
Why is red team cooking so hard again?

3705
02:22:28,150 --> 02:22:28,690
What the fuck?

3706
02:22:30,650 --> 02:22:31,550
I'm sad.

3707
02:22:31,750 --> 02:22:32,910
I made it so far.

3708
02:22:32,910 --> 02:22:35,350
Okay, I did all the hard droppers as well.

3709
02:22:36,870 --> 02:22:38,730
I can try obstacles as well.

3710
02:22:38,850 --> 02:22:40,070
Me at college, a hard dropper.

3711
02:22:41,570 --> 02:22:42,370
Hello guys.

3712
02:22:44,710 --> 02:22:45,830
You're so quiet.

3713
02:22:45,930 --> 02:22:46,590
How are you?

3714
02:22:47,130 --> 02:22:47,410
Hello!

3715
02:22:48,490 --> 02:22:49,150
What happened?

3716
02:22:49,270 --> 02:22:49,730
Fuck this.

3717
02:22:49,890 --> 02:22:50,010
I'm out.

3718
02:22:50,190 --> 02:22:51,130
I was muted for a while.

3719
02:22:51,230 --> 02:22:51,810
I was tryharding.

3720
02:22:52,090 --> 02:22:52,950
Okay, let me do the trident.

3721
02:22:54,110 --> 02:22:55,790
Honestly, do easy droppers.

3722
02:22:55,910 --> 02:22:56,550
They're free points.

3723
02:22:57,050 --> 02:22:57,930
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3724
02:22:57,930 --> 02:22:59,050
I just did them.

3725
02:23:00,350 --> 02:23:00,870
Puta!

3726
02:23:02,090 --> 02:23:03,090
Puta madre.

3727
02:23:03,850 --> 02:23:05,690
Wait, I'm not even done yet?

3728
02:23:05,710 --> 02:23:06,710
Are you serious?

3729
02:23:07,090 --> 02:23:07,410
Okay.

3730
02:23:08,130 --> 02:23:09,190
Oh my days.

3731
02:23:09,370 --> 02:23:10,770
Oh my fucking god.

3732
02:23:11,250 --> 02:23:11,770
I'm sorry.

3733
02:23:12,350 --> 02:23:13,590
Yep, you just turned British.

3734
02:23:14,150 --> 02:23:15,730
What the hell then?

3735
02:23:15,790 --> 02:23:17,350
Oh my fucking god.

3736
02:23:18,330 --> 02:23:20,670
Oh my fucking god, brother.

3737
02:23:22,390 --> 02:23:22,810
Oh, there we go.

3738
02:23:22,850 --> 02:23:23,250
Perfect.

3739
02:23:24,650 --> 02:23:26,330
How do I get to this side?

3740
02:23:28,010 --> 02:23:28,370
Oh.

3741
02:23:28,370 --> 02:23:29,170
So, have you guys missed me?

3742
02:23:29,490 --> 02:23:29,930
Please say yes.

3743
02:23:29,990 --> 02:23:30,710
Oh yeah, I did.

3744
02:23:31,230 --> 02:23:34,990
No, I was muted and tryharding for a while.

3745
02:23:35,170 --> 02:23:35,310
Oh.

3746
02:23:37,130 --> 02:23:38,450
I don't know how I made it without you.

3747
02:23:38,650 --> 02:23:40,390
Wait, you can build a... Oh my god, you can build a bridge.

3748
02:23:40,390 --> 02:23:40,970
I didn't know that.

3749
02:23:43,650 --> 02:23:44,370
Ice boat.

3750
02:23:45,290 --> 02:23:45,650
I'm...

3751
02:23:46,730 --> 02:23:47,770
Which one's easier?

3752
02:23:47,890 --> 02:23:49,890
Course 1 or course 2?

3753
02:23:51,270 --> 02:23:51,630
Uh...

3754
02:23:52,090 --> 02:23:53,110
I have no clue.

3755
02:23:53,490 --> 02:23:54,170
I just did it.

3756
02:23:54,170 --> 02:23:55,130
Oh, okay.

3757
02:23:55,870 --> 02:23:56,270
Sorry.

3758
02:23:58,050 --> 02:23:59,830
There's no difficulties in this.

3759
02:24:00,210 --> 02:24:03,570
Is it better getting the gold speed and stuff?

3760
02:24:03,630 --> 02:24:04,410
Does that give you more points?

3761
02:24:04,910 --> 02:24:05,710
Yes, yes, yes.

3762
02:24:06,150 --> 02:24:08,470
Yo, Lyne, someone called you British on my stream.

3763
02:24:09,050 --> 02:24:09,970
Oi, bruv, innit?

3764
02:24:10,090 --> 02:24:11,050
You wanna fall in gold?

3765
02:24:11,610 --> 02:24:12,790
You wanna fall in fight, man.

3766
02:24:13,230 --> 02:24:14,110
Can I do this already?

3767
02:24:14,230 --> 02:24:14,770
I don't remember.

3768
02:24:15,050 --> 02:24:17,770
When the course is open for the thingy, can you just do it again?

3769
02:24:18,310 --> 02:24:19,910
Oh, that was so sick.

3770
02:24:20,910 --> 02:24:22,310
Oh, I just fumbled so bad.

3771
02:24:22,310 --> 02:24:24,030
Uh, if the course is...

3772
02:24:24,030 --> 02:24:25,090
You want me?

3773
02:24:26,610 --> 02:24:33,250
You need to look at the little circles for the levels and see what color they're at.

3774
02:24:33,250 --> 02:24:35,070
Oh my god, I'm such a gamer.

3775
02:24:36,130 --> 02:24:37,270
You're about to cry.

3776
02:24:38,430 --> 02:24:39,610
I'm such a gamer.

3777
02:24:40,630 --> 02:24:42,070
This shit is so ass.

3778
02:24:43,250 --> 02:24:43,690
I'm actually such a gamer.

3779
02:24:43,690 --> 02:24:45,810
If you're fast...

3780
02:24:45,810 --> 02:24:48,910
Ice boat is all about speed, so if you do it fast, you get more points, yeah.

3781
02:24:49,850 --> 02:24:52,190
I just want us to get, like, on the podium.

3782
02:24:53,150 --> 02:24:54,750
I just wanna be 40th, man.

3783
02:24:55,230 --> 02:24:56,950
Okay, let me try hard a bit more in Ice Boat.

3784
02:24:58,490 --> 02:25:00,350
Dude, I've lost all my podium spots.

3785
02:25:02,310 --> 02:25:04,670
I've got stuff for us.

3786
02:25:05,430 --> 02:25:07,050
Okay, there's 20 seconds left, guys.

3787
02:25:07,190 --> 02:25:07,950
Lock in.

3788
02:25:08,270 --> 02:25:09,070
I'm trying.

3789
02:25:11,510 --> 02:25:12,310
Goddamn, goddamn.

3790
02:25:13,530 --> 02:25:13,950
I lost.

3791
02:25:14,430 --> 02:25:15,930
Oh no, I don't know where to go.

3792
02:25:15,930 --> 02:25:16,670
I don't know where to go.

3793
02:25:17,090 --> 02:25:18,270
Okay, let me just do here.

3794
02:25:19,710 --> 02:25:20,330
I have three medals.

3795
02:25:21,390 --> 02:25:23,510
Wait, I could've just made a bridge.

3796
02:25:23,730 --> 02:25:24,650
What the fuck?

3797
02:25:24,870 --> 02:25:26,530
I could've just made a bridge?

3798
02:25:27,250 --> 02:25:29,410
Okay, third place is good.

3799
02:25:30,010 --> 02:25:30,430
That's good.

3800
02:25:31,510 --> 02:25:33,410
I could've just made a...

3801
02:25:33,410 --> 02:25:34,150
Oh, I got a medal!

3802
02:25:34,850 --> 02:25:37,050
Yeah, last minute, I fucking did it.

3803
02:25:37,210 --> 02:25:41,930
I spent so much time in the fucking block placement, never knowing I could've just made a bridge.

3804
02:25:41,930 --> 02:25:45,450
I could've made a bridge.

3805
02:25:45,470 --> 02:25:46,390
Oh my god.

3806
02:25:46,410 --> 02:25:47,730
Oh my god!

3807
02:25:50,730 --> 02:25:51,950
We have a fucking gamer!

3808
02:25:56,610 --> 02:25:57,570
Locking in.

3809
02:25:59,690 --> 02:26:00,170
Nice.

3810
02:26:00,530 --> 02:26:00,690
Nice.

3811
02:26:01,910 --> 02:26:02,390
Beautiful.

3812
02:26:04,830 --> 02:26:06,630
She really wants that third place.

3813
02:26:06,750 --> 02:26:07,250
We went up!

3814
02:26:07,910 --> 02:26:09,130
Oh my god, it's heading there.

3815
02:26:09,130 --> 02:26:11,350
We're slowly getting to the third place!

3816
02:26:12,610 --> 02:26:15,110
The thing is, right?

3817
02:26:15,650 --> 02:26:25,230
Like, we are actually playing for third, because one of the games left is Extraction, which is like FPS, and the fucking red team has Zekken.

3818
02:26:26,310 --> 02:26:27,190
Which is insane.

3819
02:26:27,330 --> 02:26:29,510
He's literally on Sentinel for that one.

3820
02:26:30,370 --> 02:26:33,150
So, hey guys, we can try our best.

3821
02:26:33,330 --> 02:26:35,630
I mean, I'm pretty sure Matsuyoshi is also pretty good at shooters.

3822
02:26:35,750 --> 02:26:37,150
Yeah, I mean...

3823
02:26:37,150 --> 02:26:40,630
Sneaky is literally an Overwatch pro, so...

3824
02:26:40,630 --> 02:26:42,850
Yeah, but Overwatch doesn't require aim, so it's chill.

3825
02:26:43,130 --> 02:26:43,770
Damn!

3826
02:26:45,590 --> 02:26:46,450
31st place!

3827
02:26:46,470 --> 02:26:49,110
It was the Zenyatta player, bro!

3828
02:26:49,530 --> 02:26:55,230
It was literally the Zen player, other than the Korean Zens, though, so...

3829
02:26:55,230 --> 02:26:56,810
Bro, 31st place!

3830
02:26:57,350 --> 02:26:58,310
Holy shit!

3831
02:26:58,950 --> 02:27:00,410
Oh, he's doing his climbing!

3832
02:27:01,770 --> 02:27:02,530
That's nine!

3833
02:27:03,130 --> 02:27:06,170
Where the fuck are my memberships at, huh?

3834
02:27:06,170 --> 02:27:07,430
We haven't won yet!

3835
02:27:08,970 --> 02:27:09,730
39th place!

3836
02:27:10,330 --> 02:27:12,250
Where the fuck are my memberships at, bro?

3837
02:27:13,690 --> 02:27:15,250
That's like 10 bucks for me!

3838
02:27:15,590 --> 02:27:16,270
We're going crazy.

3839
02:27:17,150 --> 02:27:18,850
By the way, it's not over yet!

3840
02:27:18,910 --> 02:27:20,090
It's not over yet!

3841
02:27:20,530 --> 02:27:23,090
We're missing, we're missing.

3842
02:27:23,550 --> 02:27:26,610
Oh my god, I got 39th place on the fucking... that last one.

3843
02:27:26,610 --> 02:27:28,350
That last one was so confusing for me.

3844
02:27:28,690 --> 02:27:30,250
I was so confused.

3845
02:27:31,650 --> 02:27:34,110
Yeah, it's a little difficult sometimes.

3846
02:27:34,710 --> 02:27:41,570
And you know, it's because there's so many tech stuff that I've never done before, so I was really confused.

3847
02:27:41,590 --> 02:27:42,190
This is fun, I like this.

3848
02:27:43,270 --> 02:27:44,750
Wait, my favorite part is Cookie.

3849
02:27:44,990 --> 02:27:46,350
This is kind of fun.

3850
02:27:46,930 --> 02:27:50,190
Is Blockworks like an open server to just practice?

3851
02:27:50,530 --> 02:27:50,730
Did you do the Electra one?

3852
02:27:50,870 --> 02:27:52,530
No, that's not an open server.

3853
02:27:52,530 --> 02:27:53,130
Oh, the Electra one was fun.

3854
02:27:53,930 --> 02:27:55,230
I did do Electra.

3855
02:27:55,390 --> 02:27:56,010
Electra was great.

3856
02:27:56,350 --> 02:27:57,430
Electra was fun, yeah.

3857
02:27:57,670 --> 02:27:57,990
Electra.

3858
02:27:58,450 --> 02:27:59,170
Electra, fuck.

3859
02:28:00,150 --> 02:28:00,510
Electra.

3860
02:28:01,310 --> 02:28:04,090
Dude, this Cookie is like...

3861
02:28:05,110 --> 02:28:06,410
I kind of want to start a cult around that.

3862
02:28:06,690 --> 02:28:07,770
It's like talking to me.

3863
02:28:08,630 --> 02:28:09,550
It's talking to you?

3864
02:28:09,910 --> 02:28:10,270
Yeah.

3865
02:28:10,870 --> 02:28:12,530
It's telling you to kill your parents, kill your parents, kill your parents.

3866
02:28:12,990 --> 02:28:15,450
Guys, it's not last place yet, because I'm not last.

3867
02:28:16,170 --> 02:28:17,190
I was second last.

3868
02:28:17,770 --> 02:28:18,910
Yeah, to me this is a one.

3869
02:28:19,330 --> 02:28:20,790
We fucking won this shit, bro.

3870
02:28:21,010 --> 02:28:23,490
We got two ones, let's fucking go.

3871
02:28:23,850 --> 02:28:26,090
It's saving a win, it's a one, because we already won this shit.

3872
02:28:26,590 --> 02:28:29,090
Okay, is that Extraction or Blitz?

3873
02:28:29,150 --> 02:28:29,870
What's Blitz again?

3874
02:28:30,250 --> 02:28:31,570
It's a Hide and Seek.

3875
02:28:32,190 --> 02:28:33,370
Oh, it's a Hide and Seek.

3876
02:28:34,350 --> 02:28:35,250
Yeah, yeah, I bet.

3877
02:28:36,050 --> 02:28:36,910
Oh wait, I need to kill somebody.

3878
02:28:37,430 --> 02:28:38,650
What's Extraction again?

3879
02:28:38,830 --> 02:28:39,790
It's the FPS.

3880
02:28:40,430 --> 02:28:41,590
It's Rainbow Six Siege.

3881
02:28:42,090 --> 02:28:44,090
We're so cooked, we're so fucked.

3882
02:28:44,930 --> 02:28:46,890
Let me go, please.

3883
02:28:47,030 --> 02:28:47,630
Put me down.

3884
02:28:48,250 --> 02:28:50,270
We're all gamers, we should do Extraction last, though.

3885
02:28:50,650 --> 02:28:50,890
Yeah.

3886
02:28:51,650 --> 02:28:56,850
We've done Extraction last, then Red Team will have the bonus multiplier.

3887
02:28:58,010 --> 02:28:59,690
I'll keep it at $1.50.

3888
02:28:59,810 --> 02:29:07,070
Yeah, if we do Extraction first, then it's more of luck for the last multiplier.

3889
02:29:07,670 --> 02:29:08,370
But I think it's too late.

3890
02:29:08,470 --> 02:29:10,250
I think people already chose Blitz.

3891
02:29:10,510 --> 02:29:14,810
It is what it is.

3892
02:29:15,130 --> 02:29:16,330
I love Blitz Hunt.

3893
02:29:18,190 --> 02:29:20,690
Yeah, I don't think we would have changed the title.

3894
02:29:20,690 --> 02:29:20,870
Put me down.

3895
02:29:25,450 --> 02:29:26,890
Hide and seek time.

3896
02:29:27,210 --> 02:29:27,930
I'm so cooked.

3897
02:29:28,870 --> 02:29:30,350
Oh, they're just gonna find the toilet.

3898
02:29:30,870 --> 02:29:31,590
This game is actually peak content.

3899
02:29:31,790 --> 02:29:36,810
This is so hard because of lag, honestly.

3900
02:29:36,970 --> 02:29:38,250
It's peak content, though.

3901
02:29:38,250 --> 02:29:44,770
I mean, if you find a good corner, you can see where they are, but they can also scout you out, too, with abilities.

3902
02:29:45,350 --> 02:29:47,450
I'm so bad at this one, if I'm being quite honest.

3903
02:29:47,450 --> 02:29:48,390
Oh, good?

3904
02:29:48,530 --> 02:29:49,430
Nah, just lock in.

3905
02:29:49,690 --> 02:29:49,950
It's simple.

3906
02:29:50,430 --> 02:29:53,910
If you lock in, it's so simple.

3907
02:29:54,630 --> 02:29:55,430
Nah, I'm kidding.

3908
02:29:55,570 --> 02:29:58,210
It's just like, you gotta get partially lucky.

3909
02:29:58,910 --> 02:30:03,010
When you're hunting, you can right-click it, and it'll tell you how many people are near you.

3910
02:30:03,530 --> 02:30:05,330
Oh, that's new, is it?

3911
02:30:05,630 --> 02:30:07,030
Oh, wait, no, that's in our inventory.

3912
02:30:07,410 --> 02:30:07,610
Never mind.

3913
02:30:07,990 --> 02:30:13,130
I thought you meant we could find more of them, because it was out in the open.

3914
02:30:13,890 --> 02:30:15,130
Nah, it's a very quick way.

3915
02:30:15,130 --> 02:30:19,550
If you're running into a room, it's a very quick way to know if you need to look around.

3916
02:30:19,550 --> 02:30:20,910
But the cooldown's insane.

3917
02:30:21,870 --> 02:30:21,990
Mhm.

3918
02:30:23,110 --> 02:30:27,470
By the way, Wolfie, you know the other block wars, are they just normal block wars?

3919
02:30:27,530 --> 02:30:28,390
So this is the rookies, right?

3920
02:30:28,850 --> 02:30:29,110
Yeah.

3921
02:30:30,470 --> 02:30:31,090
This is rookies.

3922
02:30:31,430 --> 02:30:32,290
I don't remember the difference.

3923
02:30:33,690 --> 02:30:36,130
The player roster is very different.

3924
02:30:36,570 --> 02:30:39,130
There's, like, five minecrafters here.

3925
02:30:39,310 --> 02:30:40,090
Yeah, there's a lot of new people here.

3926
02:30:40,790 --> 02:30:44,190
It's mostly, like, non-minecraft players.

3927
02:30:44,350 --> 02:30:46,090
And then each team has one pro.

3928
02:30:47,110 --> 02:30:54,510
Okay, so what we do here is we run outwards, Hawkeye, and you find a spot to hide.

3929
02:30:56,570 --> 02:30:58,690
You'll see the hunters will be glowing.

3930
02:30:58,870 --> 02:31:00,570
You'll see us as teammates glowing as well.

3931
02:31:00,850 --> 02:31:02,410
We have 70 seconds to hide, too.

3932
02:31:03,390 --> 02:31:05,190
Dude, we can, like, jump a little higher now.

3933
02:31:06,490 --> 02:31:06,810
Mhm.

3934
02:31:08,010 --> 02:31:09,070
Shit, how do I hide?

3935
02:31:09,210 --> 02:31:10,150
Do I just, like...

3936
02:31:10,150 --> 02:31:11,990
Like, do I transform into anything?

3937
02:31:12,470 --> 02:31:13,950
No, no, no, no, there's no transforming.

3938
02:31:15,130 --> 02:31:15,590
Yeah, yeah.

3939
02:31:16,010 --> 02:31:17,390
Wait, it's the back of my head green.

3940
02:31:17,750 --> 02:31:18,570
Oh, we're all together?

3941
02:31:18,830 --> 02:31:19,110
Oh, god.

3942
02:31:19,110 --> 02:31:19,470
Oh, god.

3943
02:31:19,530 --> 02:31:20,610
I didn't even realize we're all together.

3944
02:31:20,910 --> 02:31:21,430
That's bad.

3945
02:31:23,890 --> 02:31:26,450
I didn't realize you guys were following me.

3946
02:31:28,170 --> 02:31:29,130
I was just walking.

3947
02:31:31,350 --> 02:31:33,090
I'm doing this stupid fucking game.

3948
02:31:36,940 --> 02:31:38,140
I see a peeker.

3949
02:31:39,240 --> 02:31:40,560
Jiggle peek around everywhere.

3950
02:31:42,860 --> 02:31:43,520
Oh, god.

3951
02:31:45,220 --> 02:31:46,220
They don't see me.

3952
02:31:46,480 --> 02:31:46,960
This is terrifying.

3953
02:31:46,960 --> 02:31:48,140
Why are they still here?

3954
02:31:50,620 --> 02:31:51,800
This is so terrifying.

3955
02:31:52,680 --> 02:31:53,820
Oh, god, they didn't see me.

3956
02:31:54,400 --> 02:31:55,000
Where's the other one at?

3957
02:31:55,300 --> 02:31:57,480
They're all gone, but I don't know why they're still here.

3958
02:31:58,680 --> 02:31:58,960
We're good.

3959
02:32:02,100 --> 02:32:03,380
I wanna move away.

3960
02:32:03,500 --> 02:32:04,680
I'm gonna try and get out of here.

3961
02:32:04,680 --> 02:32:07,420
I think we should stay here because they've already checked us, right?

3962
02:32:07,460 --> 02:32:08,340
So they're gonna be, like, looking.

3963
02:32:08,340 --> 02:32:09,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3964
02:32:09,960 --> 02:32:16,760
Just try to, like, keep a corner and, like, move around a little bit if they're close, just to, like, make it so they can't, like, see you in their peripheral vision.

3965
02:32:16,840 --> 02:32:17,320
I might die.

3966
02:32:17,400 --> 02:32:18,700
I think he's gonna look for me.

3967
02:32:18,880 --> 02:32:19,600
I've been detected.

3968
02:32:24,520 --> 02:32:26,400
Wait, does it tell you when you're a detective?

3969
02:32:27,400 --> 02:32:27,720
Yeah.

3970
02:32:30,200 --> 02:32:31,880
I thought you said when you are a detective.

3971
02:32:33,520 --> 02:32:35,420
It'll tell you, like, when you're detected, yeah.

3972
02:32:35,980 --> 02:32:36,380
Goddamn.

3973
02:32:37,980 --> 02:32:38,380
Goddamn!

3974
02:32:41,040 --> 02:32:41,840
We're good?

3975
02:32:42,880 --> 02:32:43,780
I think I'm good.

3976
02:32:43,960 --> 02:32:45,240
I'm good, I'm good, I'm good too.

3977
02:32:45,320 --> 02:32:46,400
I'm, like, with two other people.

3978
02:32:46,480 --> 02:32:46,780
I'm good.

3979
02:32:47,880 --> 02:32:48,460
I live.

3980
02:32:49,700 --> 02:32:50,040
Okay.

3981
02:32:51,420 --> 02:32:53,120
We should, uh... Oh, we're hunting.

3982
02:32:53,420 --> 02:32:54,360
This is good, this is good.

3983
02:32:54,960 --> 02:32:57,400
I'm going north, I'm going north, I'm going north.

3984
02:32:57,940 --> 02:32:58,200
Yeah.

3985
02:32:59,100 --> 02:32:59,900
Okay, okay.

3986
02:32:59,900 --> 02:33:01,140
I'll go west.

3987
02:33:02,260 --> 02:33:02,660
Uh...

3988
02:33:02,660 --> 02:33:04,880
You go together with... You can come with me.

3989
02:33:05,400 --> 02:33:05,520
Okay.

3990
02:33:06,140 --> 02:33:09,640
I'm gonna look inside this room because I see people hiding in the room.

3991
02:33:11,160 --> 02:33:13,520
So, this will be very good.

3992
02:33:15,040 --> 02:33:16,160
In the room, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3993
02:33:16,340 --> 02:33:18,920
I saw somebody hide in the spawn.

3994
02:33:20,160 --> 02:33:21,240
That's, uh, simple.

3995
02:33:21,780 --> 02:33:22,640
He's just not moving.

3996
02:33:22,740 --> 02:33:23,320
You can just get him.

3997
02:33:23,460 --> 02:33:23,980
That's a free kill.

3998
02:33:24,200 --> 02:33:25,980
No, I think he's gonna run to the last three.

3999
02:33:26,500 --> 02:33:27,600
No, no, no, he's not.

4000
02:33:27,960 --> 02:33:28,560
He's just baiting.

4001
02:33:29,540 --> 02:33:30,360
Yeah, he was baiting.

4002
02:33:31,780 --> 02:33:32,180
Okay.

4003
02:33:32,920 --> 02:33:38,460
Uh, yeah, so this will be good info for us to, um, kinda know... I saw Giga, I saw Giga here.

4004
02:33:39,200 --> 02:33:39,620
Like, hide.

4005
02:33:40,020 --> 02:33:40,120
Oh.

4006
02:33:41,840 --> 02:33:47,240
You can, like, run around and, and, like, spot people and just, like, punch them with your sword.

4007
02:33:47,880 --> 02:33:48,860
Okay, with the sonar, right?

4008
02:33:49,680 --> 02:33:50,860
No, with your sword.

4009
02:33:50,960 --> 02:33:51,780
You can use the sonar as well.

4010
02:33:52,520 --> 02:33:52,920
Okay.

4011
02:33:54,040 --> 02:33:55,720
You just need to punch them with your sword.

4012
02:33:56,760 --> 02:33:57,880
It's a one-shot.

4013
02:33:58,560 --> 02:33:59,120
Um...

4014
02:33:59,120 --> 02:34:00,800
There is one player nearby me.

4015
02:34:01,120 --> 02:34:02,340
He died in the lava here?

4016
02:34:03,240 --> 02:34:04,700
Remember to use your ability, guys.

4017
02:34:05,100 --> 02:34:06,100
I see somebody here.

4018
02:34:06,660 --> 02:34:07,480
It's only one.

4019
02:34:09,240 --> 02:34:10,820
Where are these bitches?

4020
02:34:10,900 --> 02:34:11,380
I got one.

4021
02:34:12,900 --> 02:34:13,460
Hmm.

4022
02:34:14,560 --> 02:34:15,940
There is one player nearby.

4023
02:34:17,440 --> 02:34:19,340
Oh, skibbity toilet room, hold on!

4024
02:34:19,900 --> 02:34:20,280
What?

4025
02:34:21,000 --> 02:34:21,980
Skibbity toilet room?

4026
02:34:23,120 --> 02:34:24,580
Oh my god, you're kidding me!

4027
02:34:24,580 --> 02:34:24,980
Oh my god.

4028
02:34:25,480 --> 02:34:26,940
I got another.

4029
02:34:28,300 --> 02:34:28,840
Maybe you're right.

4030
02:34:30,080 --> 02:34:30,860
That's actually so funny.

4031
02:34:31,700 --> 02:34:33,460
Why am I even trying to chase this guy?

4032
02:34:33,640 --> 02:34:34,580
He's way too good at movement.

4033
02:34:35,460 --> 02:34:36,800
Skibbity toilet room is okay, though.

4034
02:34:37,200 --> 02:34:38,040
There's so many good hiding spots.

4035
02:34:40,220 --> 02:34:41,060
There's zero players.

4036
02:34:41,820 --> 02:34:42,880
There's zero players, okay.

4037
02:34:43,320 --> 02:34:44,760
No people in skibbity toilet room.

4038
02:34:44,840 --> 02:34:45,840
Skibbity toilet room is clear.

4039
02:34:46,740 --> 02:34:47,180
Are we sure?

4040
02:34:48,300 --> 02:34:49,620
Yeah, skibbity toilet room.

4041
02:34:49,800 --> 02:34:50,660
Use the sonar.

4042
02:34:50,660 --> 02:34:51,040
Oh my god.

4043
02:34:51,880 --> 02:34:53,420
He really is skibbity toilet room.

4044
02:34:53,420 --> 02:34:55,400
I got 14 kills, that might be a record.

4045
02:34:55,980 --> 02:34:57,640
Holy shit, you're insane.

4046
02:34:58,080 --> 02:34:58,520
Jesus.

4047
02:34:59,300 --> 02:35:00,080
He might be him, man.

4048
02:35:01,980 --> 02:35:03,520
I only killed four.

4049
02:35:03,760 --> 02:35:04,480
I got three.

4050
02:35:05,920 --> 02:35:08,640
Someone hid in spawn, you fucking idiot.

4051
02:35:08,840 --> 02:35:09,560
Holy shit.

4052
02:35:09,880 --> 02:35:10,720
Who got 14?

4053
02:35:11,000 --> 02:35:12,020
You know Simple?

4054
02:35:13,040 --> 02:35:15,740
He was in the beginning, he just hid in spawn.

4055
02:35:17,780 --> 02:35:19,400
He was waiting for everyone to leave.

4056
02:35:19,420 --> 02:35:22,180
I think he went out and then ran back in.

4057
02:35:22,340 --> 02:35:22,700
I think.

4058
02:35:23,320 --> 02:35:24,820
He ran out.

4059
02:35:25,900 --> 02:35:27,380
You can technically hide here, yeah.

4060
02:35:28,280 --> 02:35:29,220
Oh, I don't see you.

4061
02:35:29,980 --> 02:35:30,960
Run, run, run.

4062
02:35:32,080 --> 02:35:34,060
This room is so ass.

4063
02:35:34,920 --> 02:35:36,060
Oh, this room is ass.

4064
02:35:37,420 --> 02:35:38,540
Go to the skibbity toilet room.

4065
02:35:38,540 --> 02:35:40,440
Oh, I'm not going there right now.

4066
02:35:40,560 --> 02:35:41,860
Let's find out if it's actually us.

4067
02:35:42,140 --> 02:35:43,020
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

4068
02:35:44,040 --> 02:35:45,300
I can go up here.

4069
02:35:45,300 --> 02:35:47,120
Don't go to skibbity toilet room.

4070
02:35:47,200 --> 02:35:48,900
I feel like people are gonna...

4071
02:35:48,900 --> 02:35:49,720
I might get caught.

4072
02:35:49,940 --> 02:35:51,340
This is a bad hiding spot.

4073
02:35:54,560 --> 02:35:55,120
This is L.

4074
02:35:56,160 --> 02:35:57,100
Gamers, don't look up.

4075
02:35:57,380 --> 02:35:57,620
Surely?

4076
02:35:59,400 --> 02:36:01,020
Wouldn't it be bold of me to...

4077
02:36:01,020 --> 02:36:02,140
while I'm hiding, just go pee?

4078
02:36:03,080 --> 02:36:03,480
Yeah.

4079
02:36:04,920 --> 02:36:07,040
But if you're confident enough, Loki...

4080
02:36:07,040 --> 02:36:07,600
Oh, who's running?

4081
02:36:07,820 --> 02:36:08,580
I see someone running.

4082
02:36:08,840 --> 02:36:09,760
They're right behind you.

4083
02:36:11,740 --> 02:36:13,320
They're right behind you.

4084
02:36:13,320 --> 02:36:14,060
There's two people.

4085
02:36:14,960 --> 02:36:16,380
Lead them to another person.

4086
02:36:16,660 --> 02:36:17,640
Oh, unlucky.

4087
02:36:18,200 --> 02:36:21,280
Find another person on an enemy team and lead them to it.

4088
02:36:21,640 --> 02:36:23,080
Who's in the basketball room?

4089
02:36:23,980 --> 02:36:25,680
Damn, I think we found a really good hiding spot.

4090
02:36:25,800 --> 02:36:27,220
Cause we're like, hiding in the obvious.

4091
02:36:27,440 --> 02:36:28,700
And no one's like, looking at us.

4092
02:36:30,680 --> 02:36:31,900
Oh, fuck, they're mine.

4093
02:36:32,480 --> 02:36:34,200
Okay, so what?

4094
02:36:34,280 --> 02:36:34,560
Who's that?

4095
02:36:35,360 --> 02:36:36,640
Is that Doki or Alain?

4096
02:36:36,660 --> 02:36:37,700
I didn't look back.

4097
02:36:37,880 --> 02:36:39,280
Oh, that's Doki.

4098
02:36:39,700 --> 02:36:41,020
You're in the basketball room.

4099
02:36:41,660 --> 02:36:42,060
Yeah.

4100
02:36:42,940 --> 02:36:44,940
Why did I do that, dude?

4101
02:36:44,940 --> 02:36:47,120
Why am I actually so fucking dumb?

4102
02:36:47,560 --> 02:36:48,460
Nah, nah, you're good.

4103
02:36:48,600 --> 02:36:49,180
It was funny.

4104
02:36:49,280 --> 02:36:53,000
No, dude, the other person that was like, like, with me is still alive.

4105
02:36:53,160 --> 02:36:54,180
Oh, my days.

4106
02:36:55,300 --> 02:36:55,700
Wait.

4107
02:36:56,700 --> 02:36:57,120
Oh, god.

4108
02:36:57,240 --> 02:36:58,120
Oh, no, they found Alain.

4109
02:36:58,140 --> 02:36:58,880
There's ten seconds left.

4110
02:36:58,960 --> 02:36:59,260
Ten seconds.

4111
02:37:00,820 --> 02:37:01,500
Hold on.

4112
02:37:02,380 --> 02:37:03,660
Fourteen, fourteen, fourteen.

4113
02:37:04,080 --> 02:37:06,120
Bro, is he blind?

4114
02:37:07,520 --> 02:37:08,880
Guys, I'm really shit at this game.

4115
02:37:10,160 --> 02:37:11,120
Holy shit.

4116
02:37:11,120 --> 02:37:12,180
I saved that guy.

4117
02:37:12,820 --> 02:37:13,920
Oh, never mind, never mind.

4118
02:37:14,500 --> 02:37:14,980
Bro!

4119
02:37:16,480 --> 02:37:19,620
Bro, how did line do it?

4120
02:37:20,160 --> 02:37:20,620
That's huge.

4121
02:37:21,600 --> 02:37:21,920
That's crazy.

4122
02:37:22,940 --> 02:37:22,960
Okay.

4123
02:37:25,820 --> 02:37:26,580
I win.

4124
02:37:26,680 --> 02:37:27,460
I just came back.

4125
02:37:27,820 --> 02:37:28,580
Bro, you did.

4126
02:37:28,620 --> 02:37:29,040
You did.

4127
02:37:29,880 --> 02:37:32,260
Two fuckers literally walked in front of you.

4128
02:37:32,360 --> 02:37:32,900
That's insane.

4129
02:37:33,940 --> 02:37:36,360
I have to go to the bathroom, man.

4130
02:37:37,200 --> 02:37:40,620
South is one where you can run through pretty easily.

4131
02:37:40,860 --> 02:37:42,260
So that might be a good one.

4132
02:37:43,120 --> 02:37:44,760
Who's gonna go just to the side?

4133
02:37:45,740 --> 02:37:47,200
Oh, I don't like that one.

4134
02:37:48,280 --> 02:37:48,940
What's over here?

4135
02:37:49,620 --> 02:37:50,160
Oh, this one.

4136
02:37:50,240 --> 02:37:51,120
Wait, roof gang, hold up.

4137
02:37:51,200 --> 02:37:52,660
There might be a roof here that we can sit on.

4138
02:37:53,180 --> 02:37:53,900
There is a roof.

4139
02:37:54,660 --> 02:37:55,440
This is so huge.

4140
02:37:58,280 --> 02:37:59,420
Oh, let's get the team.

4141
02:37:59,520 --> 02:37:59,880
Hold on.

4142
02:38:00,080 --> 02:38:01,120
Yeah, hold strong, hold strong.

4143
02:38:02,000 --> 02:38:03,720
I might die to this one.

4144
02:38:03,720 --> 02:38:05,260
This one I fucked up.

4145
02:38:05,920 --> 02:38:07,460
This might be the strat, actually.

4146
02:38:07,960 --> 02:38:08,680
They won't see you.

4147
02:38:08,940 --> 02:38:11,020
This is a bad one.

4148
02:38:11,100 --> 02:38:12,300
I went to a bad room.

4149
02:38:12,980 --> 02:38:13,720
Gamers, just don't look up.

4150
02:38:14,860 --> 02:38:15,580
No, we're good, Demis.

4151
02:38:16,340 --> 02:38:16,860
We're good.

4152
02:38:18,600 --> 02:38:19,640
Gamers, don't look up.

4153
02:38:20,120 --> 02:38:20,860
Yeah, they don't look up.

4154
02:38:21,380 --> 02:38:23,660
There's so many people here that...

4155
02:38:23,660 --> 02:38:25,800
Bro, bro, bro, bro.

4156
02:38:26,720 --> 02:38:27,880
He's F5, Demi.

4157
02:38:28,440 --> 02:38:30,000
He's not looking up.

4158
02:38:30,040 --> 02:38:30,500
He didn't look up.

4159
02:38:30,500 --> 02:38:31,820
He didn't look up, and he hasn't seen it.

4160
02:38:31,940 --> 02:38:33,620
He hasn't seen us, and he's gone.

4161
02:38:33,820 --> 02:38:35,020
And he's alive.

4162
02:38:38,280 --> 02:38:38,980
That's it, bro.

4163
02:38:39,820 --> 02:38:40,620
No way.

4164
02:38:41,940 --> 02:38:42,740
No way.

4165
02:38:43,660 --> 02:38:44,100
Oh, god.

4166
02:38:44,420 --> 02:38:48,740
This guy's gonna manifest pissing himself right now.

4167
02:38:48,980 --> 02:38:50,000
I'm not gonna lie.

4168
02:38:50,820 --> 02:38:51,040
Yeah.

4169
02:38:52,420 --> 02:38:54,620
I feel like I'm the anchor in this game.

4170
02:38:55,000 --> 02:38:55,460
Nah, you're good.

4171
02:38:56,900 --> 02:38:58,760
Nah, bro, no one's heavier to me.

4172
02:39:00,320 --> 02:39:02,700
Oh, they killed three yellows.

4173
02:39:02,860 --> 02:39:03,920
They killed three yellows.

4174
02:39:04,360 --> 02:39:05,880
You can't anchor in hide-and-seek.

4175
02:39:06,040 --> 02:39:06,640
It's a team effort.

4176
02:39:06,880 --> 02:39:07,680
Hey, we're having fun.

4177
02:39:07,680 --> 02:39:08,100
Oh, really?

4178
02:39:08,320 --> 02:39:10,540
Is it like individual score or something?

4179
02:39:10,620 --> 02:39:11,180
Sorry, yeah.

4180
02:39:11,220 --> 02:39:12,820
It is full individual, but like...

4181
02:39:14,960 --> 02:39:15,580
It's chill.

4182
02:39:15,660 --> 02:39:15,980
It's chill.

4183
02:39:16,060 --> 02:39:16,560
Don't worry about it.

4184
02:39:16,600 --> 02:39:17,960
Okay, Hunter coming in.

4185
02:39:18,040 --> 02:39:18,700
Will they see it?

4186
02:39:20,780 --> 02:39:21,380
He knows.

4187
02:39:22,400 --> 02:39:23,600
He's not going up here, though.

4188
02:39:23,700 --> 02:39:24,220
He doesn't know.

4189
02:39:24,220 --> 02:39:25,760
He doesn't know.

4190
02:39:26,340 --> 02:39:27,000
We're so good.

4191
02:39:28,080 --> 02:39:28,480
Bro!

4192
02:39:30,540 --> 02:39:30,940
Yo!

4193
02:39:32,740 --> 02:39:33,140
Yay!

4194
02:39:34,920 --> 02:39:36,360
Our full team survived?

4195
02:39:36,560 --> 02:39:38,160
Yeah, blue also survived, too.

4196
02:39:38,300 --> 02:39:38,880
Blue survived.

4197
02:39:40,220 --> 02:39:40,620
Crazy!

4198
02:39:42,300 --> 02:39:44,060
Um, I think...

4199
02:39:44,060 --> 02:39:45,080
Am I gonna do it again?

4200
02:39:45,240 --> 02:39:46,280
Yes, but in the other side.

4201
02:39:46,280 --> 02:39:46,280
East.

4202
02:39:46,320 --> 02:39:46,800
I'm going east.

4203
02:39:48,540 --> 02:39:50,240
Maybe south and then to the left.

4204
02:39:50,240 --> 02:39:50,660
I'm fine with lion shoe.

4205
02:39:50,740 --> 02:39:52,060
Lion shoe's insane in this game.

4206
02:39:52,060 --> 02:39:56,060
I have a crazy hiding spot in this room specifically, but it works like only half the time.

4207
02:39:57,680 --> 02:39:58,640
I'm coming for you.

4208
02:39:59,840 --> 02:40:01,380
What the fuck is this?

4209
02:40:01,380 --> 02:40:02,160
Not this one.

4210
02:40:03,800 --> 02:40:04,440
Oh, wait.

4211
02:40:04,520 --> 02:40:05,160
I might know this room.

4212
02:40:06,300 --> 02:40:07,840
I'm gonna gamble it.

4213
02:40:07,880 --> 02:40:08,680
I'm still gonna gamble it.

4214
02:40:08,740 --> 02:40:10,100
I'm gonna gamble it.

4215
02:40:10,360 --> 02:40:11,760
I fucked up.

4216
02:40:12,580 --> 02:40:13,400
I'm gonna gamble it.

4217
02:40:14,000 --> 02:40:16,580
There's too many people here.

4218
02:40:17,140 --> 02:40:18,280
There's no way.

4219
02:40:18,280 --> 02:40:18,780
There's no way.

4220
02:40:18,840 --> 02:40:19,440
I'm gonna gamble it.

4221
02:40:19,440 --> 02:40:20,360
No, this is a GG spot, guys.

4222
02:40:20,660 --> 02:40:22,760
I fucked up my hiding spot.

4223
02:40:22,920 --> 02:40:25,100
I've been detected, but I have not been killed, though.

4224
02:40:25,960 --> 02:40:27,200
The map changed and I didn't know.

4225
02:40:27,980 --> 02:40:28,760
Oh, they found me.

4226
02:40:30,140 --> 02:40:30,540
Shit.

4227
02:40:31,440 --> 02:40:32,340
God damn it.

4228
02:40:33,720 --> 02:40:35,060
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4229
02:40:35,160 --> 02:40:35,560
Damn.

4230
02:40:35,900 --> 02:40:37,580
Micro movements.

4231
02:40:40,820 --> 02:40:43,160
Feinberg on the teal.

4232
02:40:45,200 --> 02:40:46,000
Holy shit.

4233
02:40:46,000 --> 02:40:47,200
I died.

4234
02:40:49,100 --> 02:40:49,980
I panicked.

4235
02:40:50,000 --> 02:40:51,120
Micro fucking movements.

4236
02:40:51,980 --> 02:40:52,880
They won't see it.

4237
02:40:53,840 --> 02:40:54,320
Please.

4238
02:40:55,260 --> 02:40:59,660
To be fair, it's really hard to not see it.

4239
02:41:00,240 --> 02:41:01,480
This one's very hard.

4240
02:41:01,600 --> 02:41:04,980
I just imagine people jumping and being like, oh shit, I don't see anything.

4241
02:41:05,100 --> 02:41:06,200
They can easily miss it.

4242
02:41:06,540 --> 02:41:07,400
Are you kidding me?

4243
02:41:08,860 --> 02:41:10,400
This is a really good spot.

4244
02:41:11,420 --> 02:41:12,240
I'm gonna scout.

4245
02:41:14,100 --> 02:41:15,060
Dude, I'm...

4246
02:41:15,800 --> 02:41:17,760
I'm behind a one-by-one block.

4247
02:41:18,560 --> 02:41:20,540
You guys are so fucking good at hiding.

4248
02:41:21,400 --> 02:41:21,700
Yeah.

4249
02:41:22,180 --> 02:41:23,180
I don't know why.

4250
02:41:23,580 --> 02:41:25,140
Yeah, the IRS will never get me, bro.

4251
02:41:25,900 --> 02:41:27,540
What happened to the other guy that was with me?

4252
02:41:28,260 --> 02:41:29,140
I already died, man.

4253
02:41:29,580 --> 02:41:31,720
Oh no, they got found.

4254
02:41:31,780 --> 02:41:33,540
They know about the spots, probably.

4255
02:41:33,840 --> 02:41:34,820
In seconds.

4256
02:41:35,820 --> 02:41:36,620
Yeah, it's crazy.

4257
02:41:36,900 --> 02:41:40,760
All I had to do was micro tap around this block when they saw me almost.

4258
02:41:40,760 --> 02:41:41,440
Oh, hello.

4259
02:41:42,280 --> 02:41:43,920
Oh god, the whole squad's running up.

4260
02:41:43,980 --> 02:41:46,280
I've just been rotating left and right.

4261
02:41:46,560 --> 02:41:47,000
Yay!

4262
02:41:48,420 --> 02:41:49,100
We're so good.

4263
02:41:50,020 --> 02:41:52,340
Oh, the guy with me died?

4264
02:41:52,480 --> 02:41:53,080
That's funny.

4265
02:41:53,940 --> 02:41:55,820
I'm on track for point record right now.

4266
02:41:55,860 --> 02:41:56,200
Hold on.

4267
02:41:57,480 --> 02:41:58,240
Oh, go south.

4268
02:41:58,660 --> 02:41:59,540
I have a crazy spot.

4269
02:41:59,680 --> 02:41:59,820
Trust.

4270
02:42:00,280 --> 02:42:00,580
South?

4271
02:42:00,700 --> 02:42:01,120
Okay.

4272
02:42:01,740 --> 02:42:02,980
Oh wait, no, he knows.

4273
02:42:04,280 --> 02:42:05,880
Whatever, man.

4274
02:42:06,000 --> 02:42:06,200
Fuck it.

4275
02:42:07,080 --> 02:42:07,360
South?

4276
02:42:08,200 --> 02:42:09,520
He just doesn't go this way.

4277
02:42:09,740 --> 02:42:09,760
Surely.

4278
02:42:11,560 --> 02:42:12,440
Follow me.

4279
02:42:12,760 --> 02:42:13,180
Over here.

4280
02:42:13,640 --> 02:42:14,040
Ladder.

4281
02:42:16,220 --> 02:42:18,300
No, Feinberg literally made this, dude.

4282
02:42:18,460 --> 02:42:20,140
This is mine.

4283
02:42:20,320 --> 02:42:20,980
Don't worry.

4284
02:42:21,880 --> 02:42:22,700
He was just on my team last time.

4285
02:42:22,980 --> 02:42:23,420
Where?

4286
02:42:25,400 --> 02:42:26,320
There's a trapdoor.

4287
02:42:26,980 --> 02:42:28,080
Shift on the trapdoor.

4288
02:42:29,260 --> 02:42:29,700
Here?

4289
02:42:29,920 --> 02:42:30,120
Like this?

4290
02:42:30,360 --> 02:42:33,400
To the back of the wall and then shift on top again.

4291
02:42:34,380 --> 02:42:35,140
I'm worried that Feinberg's up here.

4292
02:42:35,140 --> 02:42:36,280
Oh, fuck, I fell down.

4293
02:42:38,080 --> 02:42:39,720
Just, just, just, just hold.

4294
02:42:41,600 --> 02:42:42,380
Is that Feinberg?

4295
02:42:42,880 --> 02:42:43,620
That might be Feinberg.

4296
02:42:44,340 --> 02:42:45,060
He's coming.

4297
02:42:45,840 --> 02:42:46,380
He's on his way up.

4298
02:42:49,080 --> 02:42:49,680
I'm in mid.

4299
02:42:51,520 --> 02:42:52,180
I'm in the middle.

4300
02:42:52,600 --> 02:42:54,880
And run for your dear life.

4301
02:42:59,320 --> 02:43:00,020
I got locked in.

4302
02:43:00,060 --> 02:43:00,600
I'm doing so badly.

4303
02:43:02,960 --> 02:43:03,860
I'm gonna stay here.

4304
02:43:07,640 --> 02:43:08,700
I'm so scared.

4305
02:43:08,940 --> 02:43:10,600
There's no way they're gonna find me here.

4306
02:43:12,420 --> 02:43:13,220
There's the piss trap.

4307
02:43:13,340 --> 02:43:13,860
Come on, line.

4308
02:43:14,580 --> 02:43:15,180
Give me your blessing.

4309
02:43:15,340 --> 02:43:16,220
Piss on me.

4310
02:43:18,120 --> 02:43:19,180
I knew it.

4311
02:43:19,220 --> 02:43:20,020
This one.

4312
02:43:21,460 --> 02:43:23,160
The Mr. Krabs one.

4313
02:43:23,460 --> 02:43:24,600
They love this one.

4314
02:43:25,000 --> 02:43:26,240
We have to, like, jump here.

4315
02:43:26,900 --> 02:43:28,860
There's so many new rooms.

4316
02:43:29,760 --> 02:43:31,600
Yeah, if I can see them, they can't see me.

4317
02:43:31,800 --> 02:43:32,620
I should've done it.

4318
02:43:33,200 --> 02:43:36,640
I feel like, I feel like He wouldn't expect, like, somebody to know it.

4319
02:43:37,940 --> 02:43:39,260
Do you know what I'm talking about, Wolfie?

4320
02:43:39,440 --> 02:43:40,720
In the McDonald's thingy?

4321
02:43:41,220 --> 02:43:43,680
I just did a gamer move.

4322
02:43:44,780 --> 02:43:45,500
I'll be honest.

4323
02:43:46,260 --> 02:43:47,900
Dude, I just...

4324
02:43:47,900 --> 02:43:49,320
No way, no way, no way.

4325
02:43:49,700 --> 02:43:51,580
Shit, shit, shit.

4326
02:43:52,360 --> 02:43:54,400
Point record is possibly lost.

4327
02:43:54,660 --> 02:44:01,640
9, 8, 6, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, I made it!

4328
02:44:01,640 --> 02:44:04,680
I did an actual insane gamer move.

4329
02:44:04,700 --> 02:44:07,100
I dodged two people.

4330
02:44:07,280 --> 02:44:08,260
They're on my corner.

4331
02:44:09,220 --> 02:44:11,700
Bro, they went behind me twice.

4332
02:44:13,000 --> 02:44:15,000
I'm gonna go north.

4333
02:44:16,320 --> 02:44:18,120
That was crazy.

4334
02:44:18,240 --> 02:44:19,940
Wait, red team isn't lost right now.

4335
02:44:20,160 --> 02:44:21,700
Surely, surely we close.

4336
02:44:23,180 --> 02:44:24,740
Just don't let them kill you.

4337
02:44:25,280 --> 02:44:25,740
South again?

4338
02:44:26,040 --> 02:44:26,960
I kinda wanna go south again.

4339
02:44:29,200 --> 02:44:29,920
Fuck, fuck.

4340
02:44:30,440 --> 02:44:31,940
Oh, this might be roof gang again.

4341
02:44:32,020 --> 02:44:32,780
It's roof gang.

4342
02:44:32,920 --> 02:44:33,680
Okay, roof gang time.

4343
02:44:35,440 --> 02:44:36,660
Sit on the roof, believe.

4344
02:44:37,020 --> 02:44:39,380
I think I fucked up this one for sure.

4345
02:44:39,820 --> 02:44:40,560
I found Jobart.

4346
02:44:40,720 --> 02:44:42,460
I feel like this is so obvious.

4347
02:44:43,140 --> 02:44:44,220
Like, this one, this one.

4348
02:44:45,140 --> 02:44:46,520
Wait, you guys have some height too.

4349
02:44:46,560 --> 02:44:47,340
I don't know what room that is.

4350
02:44:47,560 --> 02:44:49,060
I'm gonna go this one.

4351
02:44:49,560 --> 02:44:51,040
I don't like when people are with me.

4352
02:44:51,900 --> 02:44:52,260
Peeta.

4353
02:44:54,980 --> 02:44:55,420
Peeta.

4354
02:44:58,540 --> 02:45:00,200
I think they're gonna find me.

4355
02:45:01,260 --> 02:45:02,100
Nah, we're good.

4356
02:45:02,460 --> 02:45:03,760
I see two people.

4357
02:45:03,940 --> 02:45:05,240
Oh, okay, I see the rest of you now.

4358
02:45:05,720 --> 02:45:07,740
They're like all at the same side of the map.

4359
02:45:07,880 --> 02:45:10,300
This spot might actually be kinda goated.

4360
02:45:10,540 --> 02:45:11,740
People are going away from me.

4361
02:45:13,420 --> 02:45:14,560
It must be my aura.

4362
02:45:14,700 --> 02:45:15,340
My gamer aura.

4363
02:45:15,920 --> 02:45:16,960
Your piss aura.

4364
02:45:17,720 --> 02:45:19,100
Oh, somebody's swinging.

4365
02:45:19,100 --> 02:45:20,080
Okay, we're good.

4366
02:45:21,280 --> 02:45:21,980
They've entered.

4367
02:45:22,120 --> 02:45:23,000
No, they have not entered.

4368
02:45:23,200 --> 02:45:23,860
Are they entering?

4369
02:45:23,960 --> 02:45:24,640
They're entering now.

4370
02:45:25,380 --> 02:45:26,080
It's rain.

4371
02:45:27,140 --> 02:45:27,940
Oh, fuck.

4372
02:45:28,320 --> 02:45:29,760
I didn't know there was a ladder there.

4373
02:45:29,820 --> 02:45:30,060
Hello?

4374
02:45:30,580 --> 02:45:32,540
I didn't realize you were above me.

4375
02:45:34,000 --> 02:45:36,820
I've been detected, but no one's kinda close to me.

4376
02:45:37,400 --> 02:45:38,300
Oh, it's over here.

4377
02:45:38,440 --> 02:45:38,660
I see.

4378
02:45:39,640 --> 02:45:40,760
I didn't know there was a ladder there.

4379
02:45:40,780 --> 02:45:41,300
That's crazy.

4380
02:45:43,500 --> 02:45:44,700
Actually, it kinda goes far.

4381
02:45:46,180 --> 02:45:48,060
Why is all of them in this fucking room?

4382
02:45:48,060 --> 02:45:49,400
Get out of here.

4383
02:45:49,400 --> 02:45:49,940
Fuck off.

4384
02:45:50,120 --> 02:45:50,700
Thank you.

4385
02:45:53,680 --> 02:45:54,840
Noki's clutching up.

4386
02:45:55,140 --> 02:45:55,180
Huge.

4387
02:45:55,460 --> 02:45:56,920
Bro, bro, bro, bro.

4388
02:45:57,120 --> 02:45:58,060
Who's over here in the back?

4389
02:45:59,560 --> 02:46:00,040
Is that Haka?

4390
02:46:00,700 --> 02:46:01,180
Yes.

4391
02:46:02,220 --> 02:46:04,940
Oh, this spot's crazy.

4392
02:46:05,220 --> 02:46:05,600
Wait a minute.

4393
02:46:06,300 --> 02:46:06,540
No!

4394
02:46:07,240 --> 02:46:09,660
I got fucking bombed by the other guy.

4395
02:46:10,060 --> 02:46:10,800
Fucking cheats.

4396
02:46:12,580 --> 02:46:13,960
We're still doing great.

4397
02:46:14,360 --> 02:46:16,580
No, the one round I got caught.

4398
02:46:16,580 --> 02:46:20,580
This is the only round I got caught because I had that person with me.

4399
02:46:21,160 --> 02:46:24,760
Bro, that spot is insane.

4400
02:46:24,800 --> 02:46:25,300
One more round.

4401
02:46:26,860 --> 02:46:29,080
That spot is crazy.

4402
02:46:30,640 --> 02:46:32,260
The other guy got me caught.

4403
02:46:32,600 --> 02:46:33,440
Oh, I'm mad.

4404
02:46:34,460 --> 02:46:35,340
Oh, I know where I'm going.

4405
02:46:35,580 --> 02:46:38,560
There's one spot east.

4406
02:46:39,100 --> 02:46:40,320
It's a bit of a nasty one.

4407
02:46:43,040 --> 02:46:43,980
I'll go with you.

4408
02:46:43,980 --> 02:46:44,900
Yeah, yeah.

4409
02:46:44,920 --> 02:46:45,340
So in here.

4410
02:46:45,520 --> 02:46:45,760
In here.

4411
02:46:47,220 --> 02:46:49,300
Take the ladder over here.

4412
02:46:49,980 --> 02:46:50,860
Then up.

4413
02:46:51,900 --> 02:46:54,200
Small jump here and then on this pillar.

4414
02:46:55,020 --> 02:46:55,640
Right here.

4415
02:46:57,300 --> 02:46:59,160
I think I'm...

4416
02:46:59,160 --> 02:47:01,060
Oh, this is a bad spot.

4417
02:47:02,040 --> 02:47:02,960
Fingers crossed.

4418
02:47:03,340 --> 02:47:04,240
That's disgusting.

4419
02:47:04,600 --> 02:47:05,720
I might be the first one caught.

4420
02:47:05,740 --> 02:47:06,580
Fingers crossed.

4421
02:47:07,380 --> 02:47:08,440
Oh god, I can't see shit.

4422
02:47:08,520 --> 02:47:09,020
I can't see shit.

4423
02:47:09,100 --> 02:47:09,620
I'm shifting.

4424
02:47:11,340 --> 02:47:12,300
First F5.

4425
02:47:13,120 --> 02:47:14,620
Oh yeah, you're right.

4426
02:47:14,840 --> 02:47:16,480
Who's that on the right in the corner?

4427
02:47:16,700 --> 02:47:17,760
I have no idea.

4428
02:47:18,080 --> 02:47:18,320
Oh, Anthos.

4429
02:47:18,880 --> 02:47:21,020
Wait, how does he...

4430
02:47:21,020 --> 02:47:22,420
Oh, is he playing on F5?

4431
02:47:22,600 --> 02:47:23,360
How did he know?

4432
02:47:24,020 --> 02:47:25,620
Oh, that's a fucking Minecraft...

4433
02:47:26,180 --> 02:47:26,720
Yeah, okay.

4434
02:47:27,460 --> 02:47:28,580
Yeah, I was gonna say.

4435
02:47:29,220 --> 02:47:31,640
The other hunters don't play on F5.

4436
02:47:33,600 --> 02:47:34,800
That makes sense.

4437
02:47:34,960 --> 02:47:36,480
Who's that Widow?

4438
02:47:37,560 --> 02:47:38,240
Who's that Widow?

4439
02:47:40,360 --> 02:47:40,840
Minecrafters.

4440
02:47:40,840 --> 02:47:41,440
I think so.

4441
02:47:42,840 --> 02:47:43,960
Oh man, finally.

4442
02:47:45,040 --> 02:47:46,360
Guys, it's W-Rate.

4443
02:47:46,640 --> 02:47:46,760
Yay!

4444
02:47:47,620 --> 02:47:49,320
Wait, somebody left a call.

4445
02:47:49,420 --> 02:47:51,020
Yeah, Lineshoe's not in the VC though.

4446
02:47:51,800 --> 02:47:53,480
Okay, just ignore the heartbeat.

4447
02:47:53,600 --> 02:47:54,380
They won't find us.

4448
02:47:57,060 --> 02:47:58,540
Yup, they won't see us.

4449
02:47:58,740 --> 02:48:00,000
Yup, they won't look.

4450
02:48:00,300 --> 02:48:02,420
Oh my god, oh my god.

4451
02:48:03,520 --> 02:48:04,440
That's so scary.

4452
02:48:04,460 --> 02:48:06,440
Why are all of you guys in here?

4453
02:48:08,020 --> 02:48:09,160
It's a great spot.

4454
02:48:09,820 --> 02:48:11,640
Dude, it's such a good spot.

4455
02:48:12,060 --> 02:48:13,940
You put everything onto that.

4456
02:48:13,960 --> 02:48:15,160
It's fine, it's fine.

4457
02:48:15,440 --> 02:48:17,180
They won't look up, they just won't look up.

4458
02:48:17,380 --> 02:48:17,940
Oh, Lines did.

4459
02:48:18,340 --> 02:48:19,940
They really just won't look up.

4460
02:48:20,380 --> 02:48:21,640
And they're like, oh, where are they?

4461
02:48:22,020 --> 02:48:24,880
Oh, wow, I can't find them.

4462
02:48:25,300 --> 02:48:25,880
Oh no.

4463
02:48:26,580 --> 02:48:27,440
Oh my god.

4464
02:48:27,960 --> 02:48:28,900
Oh, he can't find us.

4465
02:48:29,280 --> 02:48:29,660
What?

4466
02:48:33,160 --> 02:48:35,220
He actually did it.

4467
02:48:35,220 --> 02:48:36,760
Oh my god.

4468
02:48:37,080 --> 02:48:37,500
That is crazy.

4469
02:48:38,320 --> 02:48:39,420
Dude, what?

4470
02:48:40,060 --> 02:48:40,700
Bro.

4471
02:48:42,940 --> 02:48:43,840
No way.

4472
02:48:45,040 --> 02:48:46,060
That was insane.

4473
02:48:46,560 --> 02:48:47,580
That's insane?

4474
02:48:48,020 --> 02:48:50,880
The fact that he didn't look up, that's... yeah.

4475
02:48:51,280 --> 02:48:52,880
No way, what the fuck?

4476
02:48:53,060 --> 02:48:53,660
How did he know?

4477
02:48:53,740 --> 02:48:56,760
He didn't have F5.

4478
02:48:56,820 --> 02:48:57,940
He didn't have F5.

4479
02:48:58,080 --> 02:49:00,680
I bumped into the one hunter that had F5 on.

4480
02:49:01,700 --> 02:49:01,760
Whoa.

4481
02:49:01,760 --> 02:49:03,380
That's so unlucky.

4482
02:49:05,300 --> 02:49:05,980
Crazy.

4483
02:49:06,540 --> 02:49:07,640
Holy fuck.

4484
02:49:08,240 --> 02:49:09,360
First place!

4485
02:49:09,560 --> 02:49:10,180
Yeah!

4486
02:49:12,800 --> 02:49:16,260
Oh my god, we have one more game to be third.

4487
02:49:17,220 --> 02:49:18,120
There's hope.

4488
02:49:18,480 --> 02:49:19,160
There's hope.

4489
02:49:20,680 --> 02:49:21,680
There's hope.

4490
02:49:22,560 --> 02:49:23,520
Oh my god, oh my god.

4491
02:49:23,640 --> 02:49:24,420
I'm getting my strepsils.

4492
02:49:25,400 --> 02:49:27,260
We gotta be able to FPS.

4493
02:49:28,480 --> 02:49:29,840
Oh my god.

4494
02:49:30,620 --> 02:49:32,000
That's where you lose me, bro.

4495
02:49:32,980 --> 02:49:33,640
There's hope.

4496
02:49:34,560 --> 02:49:35,460
We don't flank.

4497
02:49:35,920 --> 02:49:37,880
Okay, I think we should stick together.

4498
02:49:38,000 --> 02:49:42,120
Because I remember the last time we tried one person flank and the other stick together.

4499
02:49:42,240 --> 02:49:42,700
Where's Lion?

4500
02:49:42,780 --> 02:49:43,800
Is Lion pissing again?

4501
02:49:44,580 --> 02:49:45,480
I don't know where Lion is.

4502
02:49:45,500 --> 02:49:47,320
I saw him moving.

4503
02:49:48,380 --> 02:49:49,640
He's moving right now.

4504
02:49:54,120 --> 02:49:56,800
Oh my god, I was top 10 on the last one.

4505
02:49:56,960 --> 02:49:57,320
Nice.

4506
02:49:57,320 --> 02:49:58,200
Unlucky.

4507
02:49:59,220 --> 02:50:01,420
Alright, alright, alright.

4508
02:50:01,800 --> 02:50:02,600
What's the spot?

4509
02:50:05,020 --> 02:50:05,760
21st, baby!

4510
02:50:06,700 --> 02:50:07,200
21st!

4511
02:50:07,420 --> 02:50:09,420
Comeback of the fucking century!

4512
02:50:09,920 --> 02:50:11,520
Holy shit, bro.

4513
02:50:11,520 --> 02:50:13,480
That's the last game, Haka.

4514
02:50:13,600 --> 02:50:14,740
You gotta go to the other side.

4515
02:50:21,300 --> 02:50:23,040
You're in the last game.

4516
02:50:23,040 --> 02:50:23,380
9th, okay.

4517
02:50:25,660 --> 02:50:27,360
We did really good, Doki.

4518
02:50:27,420 --> 02:50:28,120
You got 9th.

4519
02:50:28,200 --> 02:50:30,720
Yeah, I just fucked up the last two.

4520
02:50:31,200 --> 02:50:32,120
The last one.

4521
02:50:32,660 --> 02:50:34,080
Because I bumped into Cam.

4522
02:50:38,610 --> 02:50:39,250
Damn.

4523
02:50:48,970 --> 02:50:49,970
Constellation tree.

4524
02:50:53,010 --> 02:50:56,410
Our hope here is that we...

4525
02:50:56,410 --> 02:50:58,330
So, slight problem.

4526
02:50:58,630 --> 02:51:00,670
The last game is an FPS game.

4527
02:51:01,310 --> 02:51:03,170
And red team is an FPS team.

4528
02:51:03,370 --> 02:51:05,650
And yellow team has FPS players.

4529
02:51:06,050 --> 02:51:07,670
So we have to clutch up.

4530
02:51:07,750 --> 02:51:08,210
It's fine.

4531
02:51:08,870 --> 02:51:09,470
We're so fucked.

4532
02:51:10,230 --> 02:51:11,170
We're so fucked, bro.

4533
02:51:11,590 --> 02:51:14,170
We need to outsmart them somehow.

4534
02:51:14,250 --> 02:51:14,790
Come on.

4535
02:51:15,350 --> 02:51:16,090
Top 3, baby.

4536
02:51:16,230 --> 02:51:16,750
Top 3.

4537
02:51:16,970 --> 02:51:17,690
I believe in us.

4538
02:51:18,050 --> 02:51:21,550
I don't know how we're gonna outsmart them when one of our teammates can't hear our comms.

4539
02:51:21,610 --> 02:51:22,590
But we'll figure it out.

4540
02:51:23,550 --> 02:51:26,770
My dance lesson teacher was like, Where are you?

4541
02:51:26,970 --> 02:51:29,010
And I didn't realize what time it is.

4542
02:51:29,030 --> 02:51:30,830
I didn't realize.

4543
02:51:34,470 --> 02:51:37,190
She cancelled the lesson on me.

4544
02:51:42,610 --> 02:51:46,790
I don't think even if we started on time, I would have made it.

4545
02:51:47,730 --> 02:51:49,270
I would have made it.

4546
02:51:49,270 --> 02:51:50,430
Fuck extraction.

4547
02:51:50,690 --> 02:51:56,390
It is crazy that we're in range to potentially make finals after the first game.

4548
02:52:00,950 --> 02:52:03,610
I didn't know what time it was.

4549
02:52:04,010 --> 02:52:06,030
I was looking at the clock.

4550
02:52:07,010 --> 02:52:08,590
I thought it was over.

4551
02:52:08,710 --> 02:52:09,610
I was so confused why it ended.

4552
02:52:11,710 --> 02:52:13,910
I just texted back.

4553
02:52:14,010 --> 02:52:14,950
I was like, I'm sorry.

4554
02:52:14,950 --> 02:52:16,670
A couple hundred points range from second.

4555
02:52:17,070 --> 02:52:19,330
Oh, this is a different map.

4556
02:52:20,850 --> 02:52:23,430
Do we split up or play together?

4557
02:52:23,590 --> 02:52:25,950
Because I remember it depends on the map itself.

4558
02:52:26,810 --> 02:52:29,150
I think the best idea is to go teams.

4559
02:52:29,290 --> 02:52:31,850
Three go right and the rest go to the flank.

4560
02:52:32,570 --> 02:52:33,870
Because the best way is to sandwich them.

4561
02:52:34,410 --> 02:52:36,610
But it's also map dependent.

4562
02:52:36,630 --> 02:52:37,930
It depends on what this map is.

4563
02:52:38,190 --> 02:52:42,770
Last time we tried sticking together and it didn't work.

4564
02:52:42,770 --> 02:52:46,670
We had to add two flanking and the others...

4565
02:52:46,670 --> 02:52:49,650
The main thing is we have to pick them off before they pick us off.

4566
02:52:50,530 --> 02:52:54,210
I think the weaker players might have to stick together.

4567
02:52:55,130 --> 02:52:55,270
Yeah.

4568
02:52:56,350 --> 02:52:58,410
The gamers are the ones who go for flank.

4569
02:52:59,890 --> 02:53:02,270
Who thinks they're a second frag for this?

4570
02:53:03,590 --> 02:53:03,950
They're what?

4571
02:53:04,790 --> 02:53:05,590
Second frag.

4572
02:53:06,070 --> 02:53:07,950
I don't know.

4573
02:53:08,550 --> 02:53:09,650
Is it right click?

4574
02:53:10,410 --> 02:53:10,890
Yeah.

4575
02:53:11,610 --> 02:53:13,390
This is the same as photon.

4576
02:53:14,570 --> 02:53:18,310
We can check in the first round and see who's the best.

4577
02:53:18,610 --> 02:53:19,290
The second best.

4578
02:53:20,250 --> 02:53:21,550
I'll try to play...

4579
02:53:21,550 --> 02:53:23,730
I'm trying to think how I approach this.

4580
02:53:23,890 --> 02:53:25,430
Because I think if you...

4581
02:53:25,430 --> 02:53:27,630
This map is so colorful.

4582
02:53:27,870 --> 02:53:30,310
It's really big for an extraction map.

4583
02:53:31,950 --> 02:53:33,030
There's a lot of angles.

4584
02:53:33,250 --> 02:53:34,290
You gotta be very careful.

4585
02:53:35,590 --> 02:53:36,650
There's so many angles.

4586
02:53:36,650 --> 02:53:38,470
Wait, what the fuck?

4587
02:53:39,090 --> 02:53:41,130
This might just be deathmatch.

4588
02:53:41,510 --> 02:53:42,770
This might be gun game.

4589
02:53:44,750 --> 02:53:50,550
What you have to look out for is just from spawn, look at the places.

4590
02:53:51,390 --> 02:53:51,970
What's swap all pen?

4591
02:53:52,670 --> 02:53:54,090
You can see the pings maybe?

4592
02:53:54,810 --> 02:53:55,590
How do you ping?

4593
02:53:57,210 --> 02:53:58,670
Which is F by default.

4594
02:53:58,690 --> 02:53:59,290
I don't see it.

4595
02:53:59,730 --> 02:54:00,010
F?

4596
02:54:00,110 --> 02:54:00,390
Okay.

4597
02:54:00,690 --> 02:54:02,030
Maybe the game needs to start to do it.

4598
02:54:02,970 --> 02:54:03,890
It's right click.

4599
02:54:03,990 --> 02:54:04,670
Do you mean you reload?

4600
02:54:04,670 --> 02:54:05,570
I forgot to reload.

4601
02:54:05,670 --> 02:54:06,450
No, no, no reload.

4602
02:54:06,570 --> 02:54:08,150
It doesn't automatically.

4603
02:54:08,510 --> 02:54:09,170
Where do I go?

4604
02:54:10,110 --> 02:54:14,630
Loki, me, Rekka go right, Rez go left.

4605
02:54:15,130 --> 02:54:16,250
Nami and Wolfie go left.

4606
02:54:16,670 --> 02:54:18,270
I'll grab the smoke bomb and mid.

4607
02:54:18,890 --> 02:54:19,670
Or you can grab it too.

4608
02:54:20,010 --> 02:54:21,450
Us three gotta be careful.

4609
02:54:21,450 --> 02:54:24,710
I don't think it's a good idea.

4610
02:54:24,750 --> 02:54:25,590
Who are we playing against?

4611
02:54:26,150 --> 02:54:27,250
Who are we playing against?

4612
02:54:27,910 --> 02:54:28,790
Who am I going with?

4613
02:54:31,250 --> 02:54:32,550
You went right I guess.

4614
02:54:32,550 --> 02:54:34,430
I forgot about the auto charge.

4615
02:54:35,610 --> 02:54:36,990
There's a yellow guy in mid.

4616
02:54:37,070 --> 02:54:37,790
We need to be careful.

4617
02:54:38,530 --> 02:54:40,210
Right side is clear I think?

4618
02:54:40,510 --> 02:54:41,990
Right side, I don't see it.

4619
02:54:42,490 --> 02:54:43,230
They're left side.

4620
02:54:43,430 --> 02:54:44,390
I hit one.

4621
02:54:48,730 --> 02:54:50,770
I'm trying to take long angles.

4622
02:54:51,030 --> 02:54:51,870
See if that'll help.

4623
02:54:52,630 --> 02:54:53,350
I'm gonna try and flank.

4624
02:54:54,510 --> 02:54:55,470
They're on top.

4625
02:54:55,650 --> 02:54:56,710
They're coming from the left.

4626
02:54:57,630 --> 02:54:58,210
I'm going flank.

4627
02:54:58,210 --> 02:54:58,650
I'm going flank.

4628
02:55:00,990 --> 02:55:01,890
They're all here.

4629
02:55:03,290 --> 02:55:04,070
I'm dead.

4630
02:55:05,170 --> 02:55:05,930
I'm good.

4631
02:55:06,210 --> 02:55:07,150
I'm running back.

4632
02:55:07,530 --> 02:55:08,990
They're all behind me.

4633
02:55:10,850 --> 02:55:11,710
I'm okay.

4634
02:55:12,870 --> 02:55:13,970
There's one on top.

4635
02:55:15,210 --> 02:55:15,410
What?

4636
02:55:17,410 --> 02:55:18,230
Okay, got one.

4637
02:55:19,050 --> 02:55:20,510
They're all on top.

4638
02:55:22,530 --> 02:55:24,010
Anthos here is low.

4639
02:55:24,650 --> 02:55:25,150
I'm one hit.

4640
02:55:25,150 --> 02:55:27,390
One on you.

4641
02:55:28,390 --> 02:55:29,670
I got one.

4642
02:55:30,430 --> 02:55:31,670
This is a Valorant team.

4643
02:55:33,270 --> 02:55:34,230
It's 1v2.

4644
02:55:34,710 --> 02:55:35,330
You see them.

4645
02:55:35,370 --> 02:55:35,730
They're glowing.

4646
02:55:35,930 --> 02:55:38,070
I think one of them has to be at least 2 HP.

4647
02:55:39,910 --> 02:55:40,350
Oh shit.

4648
02:55:41,110 --> 02:55:42,590
I didn't know where the...

4649
02:55:42,950 --> 02:55:44,910
That was just me?

4650
02:55:45,110 --> 02:55:46,610
I thought it meant...

4651
02:55:47,150 --> 02:55:48,710
I didn't realize it was just me.

4652
02:55:48,870 --> 02:55:49,990
I thought it meant...

4653
02:55:50,730 --> 02:55:53,610
You were saying we're 2v1.

4654
02:55:53,610 --> 02:55:54,250
Oh, that's good.

4655
02:55:55,190 --> 02:55:56,910
Red team swept though.

4656
02:55:58,030 --> 02:55:59,070
That's fine.

4657
02:56:00,010 --> 02:56:01,050
Learning experience.

4658
02:56:01,810 --> 02:56:03,090
I didn't realize it was just me left.

4659
02:56:03,170 --> 02:56:05,190
I think I can be second frag.

4660
02:56:05,570 --> 02:56:06,750
Because I got...

4661
02:56:07,470 --> 02:56:09,870
Play with at least one teammate.

4662
02:56:10,190 --> 02:56:12,330
And then I will scout a little bit.

4663
02:56:13,970 --> 02:56:14,610
Needing the health up?

4664
02:56:15,290 --> 02:56:16,170
They like going above.

4665
02:56:17,270 --> 02:56:18,550
Should we go above too?

4666
02:56:19,250 --> 02:56:20,770
This is a different team.

4667
02:56:21,590 --> 02:56:22,790
They're all right side.

4668
02:56:22,910 --> 02:56:23,630
They're all right side.

4669
02:56:24,030 --> 02:56:25,310
I got one.

4670
02:56:26,430 --> 02:56:28,690
They're on top.

4671
02:56:28,830 --> 02:56:29,070
They're on top.

4672
02:56:30,890 --> 02:56:31,330
Fuck.

4673
02:56:32,550 --> 02:56:32,730
Got me.

4674
02:56:34,770 --> 02:56:35,570
I'm boosting.

4675
02:56:37,050 --> 02:56:37,690
No.

4676
02:56:38,870 --> 02:56:39,510
I...

4677
02:56:40,410 --> 02:56:41,350
There's one.

4678
02:56:41,530 --> 02:56:42,470
I got booster.

4679
02:56:44,690 --> 02:56:46,130
I'm at 2 HP left.

4680
02:56:46,350 --> 02:56:46,990
Where's spawn?

4681
02:56:46,990 --> 02:56:48,990
There's spawn.

4682
02:56:49,130 --> 02:56:49,390
There's spawn.

4683
02:56:50,150 --> 02:56:51,410
I got one.

4684
02:56:52,090 --> 02:56:53,610
Both of them are spawn.

4685
02:56:54,850 --> 02:56:55,670
I'll spawn.

4686
02:56:56,050 --> 02:56:57,110
Don't die.

4687
02:56:57,990 --> 02:57:02,250
I got one.

4688
02:57:02,830 --> 02:57:03,990
One left.

4689
02:57:04,650 --> 02:57:05,690
In mid.

4690
02:57:06,530 --> 02:57:07,850
Going to spawn.

4691
02:57:08,470 --> 02:57:09,050
On top.

4692
02:57:10,010 --> 02:57:10,710
Be careful.

4693
02:57:12,770 --> 02:57:13,770
I'm down.

4694
02:57:14,630 --> 02:57:16,310
I got her.

4695
02:57:17,450 --> 02:57:18,310
Shift in mid.

4696
02:57:18,450 --> 02:57:20,490
Hold shift in mid.

4697
02:57:21,310 --> 02:57:21,850
Extracting.

4698
02:57:22,910 --> 02:57:23,630
Beautiful.

4699
02:57:25,030 --> 02:57:27,070
We got points though.

4700
02:57:32,030 --> 02:57:33,110
Comets.

4701
02:57:33,130 --> 02:57:34,570
That's the FPS team.

4702
02:57:37,670 --> 02:57:40,510
We gotta get high ground.

4703
02:57:41,090 --> 02:57:42,910
I'm going right side to get the health up.

4704
02:57:43,050 --> 02:57:43,770
I'll follow you, Wolfie.

4705
02:57:44,550 --> 02:57:44,830
Okay.

4706
02:57:45,870 --> 02:57:47,490
I'm gonna go mid.

4707
02:57:48,290 --> 02:57:49,570
And just peek around.

4708
02:57:49,830 --> 02:57:50,510
See where they are.

4709
02:57:51,990 --> 02:57:52,490
It's fine.

4710
02:57:52,610 --> 02:57:53,050
I hit two.

4711
02:57:53,270 --> 02:57:53,770
I hit three.

4712
02:57:53,990 --> 02:57:54,750
One guy is 1 HP.

4713
02:57:57,250 --> 02:57:58,250
Two right side.

4714
02:57:58,910 --> 02:57:59,690
They're in the middle.

4715
02:58:00,390 --> 02:58:01,210
There's one person in the middle.

4716
02:58:01,430 --> 02:58:01,850
I'm flanking.

4717
02:58:03,570 --> 02:58:06,130
Dude, sleeping caught me.

4718
02:58:06,270 --> 02:58:06,670
Holy shit.

4719
02:58:06,670 --> 02:58:08,690
Yeah, she has one.

4720
02:58:12,550 --> 02:58:14,890
I can't beat fucking Senzeken.

4721
02:58:16,830 --> 02:58:18,170
Reign is one.

4722
02:58:18,950 --> 02:58:20,670
Okay, one's...

4723
02:58:21,310 --> 02:58:21,570
Oh, there they are.

4724
02:58:22,690 --> 02:58:23,930
I got one HP.

4725
02:58:24,950 --> 02:58:26,270
One low mid, one top mid.

4726
02:58:26,390 --> 02:58:27,650
Turn around.

4727
02:58:28,350 --> 02:58:30,270
Oh, fuck.

4728
02:58:31,490 --> 02:58:32,310
Nice one, Shu.

4729
02:58:33,110 --> 02:58:34,110
Good damage or kills.

4730
02:58:34,370 --> 02:58:34,850
Just try.

4731
02:58:34,850 --> 02:58:35,270
Oh my god.

4732
02:58:35,770 --> 02:58:38,070
Is it points or extraction?

4733
02:58:39,270 --> 02:58:39,770
Both.

4734
02:58:41,130 --> 02:58:42,410
There's kill points.

4735
02:58:42,550 --> 02:58:43,170
There's damage points.

4736
02:58:43,290 --> 02:58:44,190
There's extracting points.

4737
02:58:44,290 --> 02:58:45,230
And there's round win points.

4738
02:58:47,090 --> 02:58:48,950
All good that we play for third here.

4739
02:58:49,890 --> 02:58:50,610
That's the goal.

4740
02:58:51,150 --> 02:58:52,030
Let's go.

4741
02:58:53,350 --> 02:58:54,710
We just got...

4742
02:58:54,710 --> 02:59:00,290
The teams that I thought were gonna do better have done better.

4743
02:59:00,450 --> 02:59:01,790
Which is fine.

4744
02:59:03,870 --> 02:59:07,810
That doesn't sound encouraging when you say it like that.

4745
02:59:08,190 --> 02:59:11,930
I'm gonna say it like I didn't go in expecting to win.

4746
02:59:12,090 --> 02:59:13,370
I'm going left for heals.

4747
02:59:14,430 --> 02:59:16,350
Okay, I'll go middle again.

4748
02:59:18,410 --> 02:59:18,710
Okay.

4749
02:59:19,210 --> 02:59:21,250
It's been nice to scout everything out a little bit.

4750
02:59:21,470 --> 02:59:22,750
Oh, YOLO lost last round.

4751
02:59:23,490 --> 02:59:26,710
I think scouting is the best thing so we know where they are.

4752
02:59:27,590 --> 02:59:28,770
Oh, you're going with me again?

4753
02:59:28,830 --> 02:59:29,150
Oh god.

4754
02:59:29,150 --> 02:59:29,410
Okay.

4755
02:59:30,650 --> 02:59:31,890
What do you mean oh god?

4756
02:59:31,970 --> 02:59:32,970
What do you say like that?

4757
02:59:33,950 --> 02:59:35,090
Wait, they went extraction.

4758
02:59:35,270 --> 02:59:36,570
They're literally going extraction.

4759
02:59:37,490 --> 02:59:38,530
One guy went extracted.

4760
02:59:39,090 --> 02:59:40,350
Oh, they're all...

4761
02:59:40,350 --> 02:59:42,810
Early, early, early left side.

4762
02:59:43,110 --> 02:59:44,230
Wait, what if I do that too?

4763
02:59:44,910 --> 02:59:46,490
Kill their ass, kill their ass, kill their ass.

4764
02:59:46,570 --> 02:59:48,990
Oh shit, I should have done that.

4765
02:59:49,310 --> 02:59:50,430
Okay, Feinberg's left I think.

4766
02:59:50,830 --> 02:59:52,410
Wait, that guy is one, yeah.

4767
02:59:53,610 --> 02:59:54,150
Okay, thanks.

4768
02:59:54,810 --> 02:59:55,450
It's just Feinberg.

4769
02:59:55,550 --> 02:59:56,210
I don't know where he's at.

4770
02:59:56,210 --> 02:59:57,530
Oh, middle, middle, middle.

4771
02:59:57,630 --> 02:59:57,850
Nice.

4772
02:59:58,270 --> 03:00:02,470
I saw one of them extract.

4773
03:00:02,670 --> 03:00:03,890
I was like, I'm gonna do that too.

4774
03:00:06,250 --> 03:00:07,530
That is insane.

4775
03:00:07,790 --> 03:00:08,990
They got one extraction.

4776
03:00:09,410 --> 03:00:11,590
Like go in the middle and just like straight up extract.

4777
03:00:11,710 --> 03:00:12,770
I killed somebody.

4778
03:00:16,190 --> 03:00:16,590
Problem.

4779
03:00:17,530 --> 03:00:19,870
We're just preying on yellow team's downfall.

4780
03:00:20,010 --> 03:00:20,290
And blue.

4781
03:00:20,950 --> 03:00:23,670
I think yellow team is not doing as good as you thought they would.

4782
03:00:24,430 --> 03:00:25,750
Oh, they're third right now.

4783
03:00:26,870 --> 03:00:27,290
Yeah.

4784
03:00:27,670 --> 03:00:28,270
They're still third.

4785
03:00:28,670 --> 03:00:30,950
There's no points on the tab list.

4786
03:00:31,890 --> 03:00:33,690
Yeah, it's like yellow is doing the best.

4787
03:00:33,750 --> 03:00:34,910
Yellow is doing the best.

4788
03:00:35,250 --> 03:00:36,250
They have 5-0'd.

4789
03:00:37,550 --> 03:00:38,390
Holy shit.

4790
03:00:39,950 --> 03:00:40,410
It's all good.

4791
03:00:40,490 --> 03:00:41,670
Okay, I'm gonna go...

4792
03:00:42,390 --> 03:00:42,770
Left side.

4793
03:00:43,050 --> 03:00:43,910
Oh, I'm mid.

4794
03:00:44,030 --> 03:00:45,030
Someone get the extra HP.

4795
03:00:45,950 --> 03:00:46,810
Left or right?

4796
03:00:48,630 --> 03:00:49,970
Yeah, I'll go right.

4797
03:00:50,210 --> 03:00:50,970
Whoever's going right.

4798
03:00:52,090 --> 03:00:52,810
Okay, left.

4799
03:00:53,050 --> 03:00:53,770
People are left.

4800
03:00:55,130 --> 03:00:55,850
Go back.

4801
03:00:56,570 --> 03:00:57,670
I'm just pushing their spawn.

4802
03:00:58,730 --> 03:00:59,950
They're on top.

4803
03:01:00,850 --> 03:01:01,710
They're on top and mid.

4804
03:01:03,310 --> 03:01:03,810
Shot one.

4805
03:01:04,190 --> 03:01:05,650
Wait, do you not charge your phone while you're using it?

4806
03:01:06,550 --> 03:01:07,670
I forgot to plug it in.

4807
03:01:09,890 --> 03:01:10,590
There's the other one.

4808
03:01:10,770 --> 03:01:11,330
I died.

4809
03:01:11,490 --> 03:01:12,070
They're on top.

4810
03:01:13,370 --> 03:01:14,050
They're right there.

4811
03:01:14,210 --> 03:01:16,150
No, he got me.

4812
03:01:17,170 --> 03:01:17,530
Shit.

4813
03:01:17,530 --> 03:01:19,010
I'm dead.

4814
03:01:19,510 --> 03:01:21,050
It's just you.

4815
03:01:21,650 --> 03:01:22,750
It's just you.

4816
03:01:23,710 --> 03:01:24,490
Okay.

4817
03:01:27,610 --> 03:01:28,390
Unlucky.

4818
03:01:29,290 --> 03:01:30,250
Unlucky, yeah.

4819
03:01:31,410 --> 03:01:31,670
Alright.

4820
03:01:32,290 --> 03:01:33,210
Oh, dude.

4821
03:01:34,330 --> 03:01:35,050
Oh, dude.

4822
03:01:35,730 --> 03:01:42,510
Whoever I was fighting was really good.

4823
03:01:43,550 --> 03:01:44,910
Who killed you?

4824
03:01:44,970 --> 03:01:45,530
I don't know.

4825
03:01:46,290 --> 03:01:46,850
Sandwichlord.

4826
03:01:46,970 --> 03:01:49,730
Yeah, he fucked me up there.

4827
03:01:49,870 --> 03:01:51,430
He's crazy.

4828
03:01:51,570 --> 03:01:52,130
Alright.

4829
03:01:53,730 --> 03:01:55,470
Why am I spawning mid?

4830
03:01:55,770 --> 03:01:57,410
I need my health up.

4831
03:01:57,450 --> 03:01:58,490
I was so used to it.

4832
03:01:59,630 --> 03:02:01,430
Okay, we can beat the knights.

4833
03:02:01,690 --> 03:02:01,990
I believe.

4834
03:02:03,370 --> 03:02:03,850
I believe.

4835
03:02:06,890 --> 03:02:08,590
I'll grab the smoke.

4836
03:02:08,910 --> 03:02:10,450
Get the thingy, Wolf.

4837
03:02:12,110 --> 03:02:13,010
I got it.

4838
03:02:13,010 --> 03:02:14,350
I don't think there's anyone left side.

4839
03:02:14,370 --> 03:02:15,110
I'm gonna go all the way around.

4840
03:02:17,210 --> 03:02:18,230
Oh, they're on top.

4841
03:02:18,810 --> 03:02:20,170
They're right behind me.

4842
03:02:20,330 --> 03:02:21,330
They're in spawn.

4843
03:02:23,530 --> 03:02:24,830
They went all the way back.

4844
03:02:25,130 --> 03:02:25,910
They're all together.

4845
03:02:26,470 --> 03:02:27,270
I shot Point Crow.

4846
03:02:29,470 --> 03:02:30,710
Shit, it's on the roof.

4847
03:02:31,690 --> 03:02:32,650
How the fuck did they go over here?

4848
03:02:33,390 --> 03:02:34,370
They all went together.

4849
03:02:35,490 --> 03:02:35,850
Misty.

4850
03:02:38,270 --> 03:02:38,630
Misty.

4851
03:02:38,810 --> 03:02:40,390
Oh my god, the whole squad there.

4852
03:02:40,390 --> 03:02:41,730
I got Vinny.

4853
03:02:41,890 --> 03:02:42,730
I hit two on Vinny.

4854
03:02:43,210 --> 03:02:45,490
That was a crazy snipe.

4855
03:02:49,630 --> 03:02:50,230
Extracting!

4856
03:02:50,430 --> 03:02:51,550
Point Crow on me.

4857
03:02:52,350 --> 03:02:52,930
Let's go.

4858
03:02:53,510 --> 03:02:54,410
I got him.

4859
03:02:55,030 --> 03:02:56,550
No, I died.

4860
03:02:57,010 --> 03:02:58,130
You extracted?

4861
03:02:58,930 --> 03:03:00,450
I got one.

4862
03:03:00,710 --> 03:03:01,530
Last one.

4863
03:03:01,650 --> 03:03:01,950
Nice.

4864
03:03:03,770 --> 03:03:04,350
Extract.

4865
03:03:05,890 --> 03:03:06,410
Believe.

4866
03:03:06,410 --> 03:03:06,610
Believe.

4867
03:03:07,790 --> 03:03:08,350
Huge.

4868
03:03:10,990 --> 03:03:11,830
Let's go.

4869
03:03:13,750 --> 03:03:15,010
I also have my smoke still.

4870
03:03:20,110 --> 03:03:21,590
We're fourth now.

4871
03:03:22,590 --> 03:03:23,690
Or have we always been fourth?

4872
03:03:23,850 --> 03:03:24,530
I don't remember.

4873
03:03:24,810 --> 03:03:26,170
The points are hidden.

4874
03:03:26,790 --> 03:03:26,850
Oh.

4875
03:03:29,210 --> 03:03:30,270
It's the last round.

4876
03:03:30,470 --> 03:03:31,830
I'm going to get HP.

4877
03:03:33,430 --> 03:03:33,510
Believe.

4878
03:03:34,050 --> 03:03:34,450
Believe.

4879
03:03:38,230 --> 03:03:39,470
I might be gay.

4880
03:03:40,090 --> 03:03:40,430
HP?

4881
03:03:41,530 --> 03:03:42,550
Right behind you.

4882
03:03:43,590 --> 03:03:44,090
Watch out.

4883
03:03:45,330 --> 03:03:46,930
I'm backing a little bit.

4884
03:03:47,190 --> 03:03:48,690
It's the Among Us skin, bro.

4885
03:03:49,510 --> 03:03:50,510
I'm backing up a little bit.

4886
03:03:50,530 --> 03:03:50,710
Careful.

4887
03:03:51,430 --> 03:03:51,910
Oh, unlucky.

4888
03:03:52,630 --> 03:03:53,250
I smoked too hard there.

4889
03:03:53,670 --> 03:03:54,150
Where the hell?

4890
03:03:54,310 --> 03:03:54,530
Oh, there.

4891
03:03:55,330 --> 03:03:55,870
Oh, I'm dead.

4892
03:03:59,630 --> 03:04:00,450
I'm fucking dead.

4893
03:04:00,450 --> 03:04:01,630
I was going to throw a smoke.

4894
03:04:01,950 --> 03:04:02,650
Come on.

4895
03:04:02,890 --> 03:04:03,310
Huge.

4896
03:04:04,030 --> 03:04:05,590
Oh, no.

4897
03:04:05,950 --> 03:04:06,490
You guys.

4898
03:04:07,130 --> 03:04:07,750
You got this.

4899
03:04:08,010 --> 03:04:08,410
You got this.

4900
03:04:09,430 --> 03:04:10,410
I got one of them.

4901
03:04:11,910 --> 03:04:13,190
Peter Griffin's coming.

4902
03:04:13,710 --> 03:04:15,790
Gigas on the top of the extraction point.

4903
03:04:17,270 --> 03:04:18,230
Yes, I got him.

4904
03:04:18,570 --> 03:04:19,810
I got two kills.

4905
03:04:21,890 --> 03:04:23,650
I got two points for us there.

4906
03:04:24,330 --> 03:04:25,030
Gigas extraction.

4907
03:04:26,910 --> 03:04:27,370
All right.

4908
03:04:27,370 --> 03:04:28,710
We did all right.

4909
03:04:30,950 --> 03:04:33,210
Pretty solid performance.

4910
03:04:33,970 --> 03:04:35,250
I got nine kills.

4911
03:04:35,290 --> 03:04:37,790
How many damage?

4912
03:04:38,990 --> 03:04:40,250
I have nine kills.

4913
03:04:40,430 --> 03:04:41,770
36 damage.

4914
03:04:42,250 --> 03:04:44,610
Nine kills, 32 hits.

4915
03:04:45,390 --> 03:04:45,790
Large?

4916
03:04:47,370 --> 03:04:47,590
Yeah.

4917
03:04:48,090 --> 03:04:48,910
Three hits.

4918
03:04:51,290 --> 03:04:51,730
Beautiful.

4919
03:04:51,730 --> 03:04:51,930
Beautiful.

4920
03:04:55,770 --> 03:04:57,950
We clucked two on top.

4921
03:04:58,170 --> 03:04:59,150
Oh, hell no, bro.

4922
03:04:59,450 --> 03:05:00,950
Score break not done.

4923
03:05:01,990 --> 03:05:03,930
Third place or fourth?

4924
03:05:04,130 --> 03:05:05,290
Third or fourth?

4925
03:05:05,470 --> 03:05:07,010
Let's go third or fourth.

4926
03:05:11,250 --> 03:05:12,290
Oh, man.

4927
03:05:12,410 --> 03:05:14,570
I'm so glad we don't have to reload.

4928
03:05:15,110 --> 03:05:17,730
Because the last time we were reloading was so fucking...

4929
03:05:17,730 --> 03:05:18,370
Dang it.

4930
03:05:21,310 --> 03:05:22,190
Lovely Patreons.

4931
03:05:23,430 --> 03:05:23,870
Yeah.

4932
03:05:24,810 --> 03:05:27,410
Oh, shout out to all those Patreons.

4933
03:05:27,650 --> 03:05:28,730
Yeah, shout out to them.

4934
03:05:28,990 --> 03:05:30,710
Oh my God, Feinberg's a Patreon?

4935
03:05:30,890 --> 03:05:32,130
Shout out to my boy, Doofs.

4936
03:05:34,270 --> 03:05:36,050
That's how he gets in every time.

4937
03:05:37,630 --> 03:05:37,950
Totally.

4938
03:05:42,220 --> 03:05:43,200
Guys, we did it.

4939
03:05:43,360 --> 03:05:44,080
We're not last.

4940
03:05:44,340 --> 03:05:45,560
Dude, Astro's fifth time.

4941
03:05:45,560 --> 03:05:47,900
Wait, no, these are individuals.

4942
03:05:47,960 --> 03:05:48,860
This is top ten points.

4943
03:05:48,860 --> 03:05:49,880
Oh, I was gonna say.

4944
03:05:50,660 --> 03:05:52,620
The team is called Astro?

4945
03:05:53,420 --> 03:05:55,240
Whoa, Sleepy got seventh.

4946
03:05:56,440 --> 03:05:57,100
Holy moly.

4947
03:05:58,240 --> 03:05:59,620
Come on, our boy Wolfie.

4948
03:06:00,260 --> 03:06:02,040
Yeah, this is mine.

4949
03:06:02,620 --> 03:06:02,620
Is it fourth?

4950
03:06:02,640 --> 03:06:03,080
Are you fourth?

4951
03:06:03,580 --> 03:06:04,060
Yeah.

4952
03:06:05,500 --> 03:06:06,340
Let's go.

4953
03:06:07,360 --> 03:06:08,380
Let's go.

4954
03:06:09,160 --> 03:06:10,720
Oh, Feinberg's third.

4955
03:06:10,880 --> 03:06:11,340
Crazy.

4956
03:06:11,780 --> 03:06:12,360
Who's second or first?

4957
03:06:12,360 --> 03:06:13,860
I've never seen Feinberg play before.

4958
03:06:15,220 --> 03:06:18,180
Oh, I killed him in the last round.

4959
03:06:19,740 --> 03:06:22,800
Yeah, he might be first, but I killed him in the extraction.

4960
03:06:24,920 --> 03:06:26,400
Yo, 39th, baby.

4961
03:06:26,600 --> 03:06:27,180
Let's go.

4962
03:06:28,560 --> 03:06:29,460
Wait, really?

4963
03:06:31,880 --> 03:06:32,440
39th.

4964
03:06:32,440 --> 03:06:33,220
Yay, 20th.

4965
03:06:35,320 --> 03:06:41,960
For us not being able to do the first game, that's pretty good.

4966
03:06:42,360 --> 03:06:44,480
We lost the entire first game.

4967
03:06:44,820 --> 03:06:45,920
Sixth place, okay, okay.

4968
03:06:50,100 --> 03:06:51,240
Hey, pretty good, though.

4969
03:06:51,280 --> 03:06:52,800
Eighth, fifth, though, yeah.

4970
03:06:53,100 --> 03:06:57,860
I think if we had the first game, we would've been fourth.

4971
03:06:58,180 --> 03:06:59,340
Yeah, no, 100%.

4972
03:06:59,340 --> 03:07:00,100
Yeah.

4973
03:07:01,080 --> 03:07:03,660
So this is blue, probably, I think.

4974
03:07:04,740 --> 03:07:05,340
Versus...

4975
03:07:05,340 --> 03:07:06,360
Who's left?

4976
03:07:07,440 --> 03:07:10,360
It's either red or...

4977
03:07:10,360 --> 03:07:12,360
Oh, it's Comets versus...

4978
03:07:13,100 --> 03:07:14,140
It's either blue or orange.

4979
03:07:16,000 --> 03:07:17,280
Hold on.

4980
03:07:17,640 --> 03:07:19,600
With 12,902 points.

4981
03:07:19,620 --> 03:07:21,940
Oh, okay, okay.

4982
03:07:22,860 --> 03:07:24,420
This is, uh...

4983
03:07:24,420 --> 03:07:25,300
Sandwich Lord.

4984
03:07:26,940 --> 03:07:27,100
Oh.

4985
03:07:28,100 --> 03:07:30,220
That's Blanche's choice out of five.

4986
03:07:30,920 --> 03:07:32,440
Okay, so this is the...

4987
03:07:32,440 --> 03:07:34,080
Sleepy and Rain team...

4988
03:07:34,080 --> 03:07:36,080
versus the, like...

4989
03:07:36,080 --> 03:07:38,160
Nintendo speedrunner team, I think.

4990
03:07:38,160 --> 03:07:40,440
Nintendo speedrunner?

4991
03:07:41,680 --> 03:07:43,860
That team is fucking stacked!

4992
03:07:43,980 --> 03:07:44,740
What the fuck?

4993
03:07:45,580 --> 03:07:47,620
The Nintendo speedrunners are crazy!

4994
03:07:48,700 --> 03:07:50,180
They're all rounders!

4995
03:07:50,560 --> 03:07:50,880
Yeah, me.

4996
03:07:54,300 --> 03:07:55,160
What's up, Heavenly?

4997
03:07:55,360 --> 03:07:55,740
What's up?

4998
03:07:56,980 --> 03:07:58,220
That's crazy you lost like that.

4999
03:07:58,680 --> 03:08:00,220
Shut the fuck up, man!

5000
03:08:01,680 --> 03:08:04,160
Why is there Hoogie, like, a fucking Doombot?

5001
03:08:04,280 --> 03:08:05,940
No, the fucking bomb monster from Doom.

5002
03:08:06,460 --> 03:08:08,420
There's no way he did that.

5003
03:08:09,660 --> 03:08:10,060
Damn.

5004
03:08:10,520 --> 03:08:11,140
Disrespectful, dude.

5005
03:08:11,720 --> 03:08:13,340
The disrespect is insane?

5006
03:08:14,360 --> 03:08:15,740
Oh my god, he left the whole server.

5007
03:08:16,120 --> 03:08:17,940
This is gonna be an interesting, uh...

5008
03:08:18,620 --> 03:08:18,940
thingy.

5009
03:08:19,040 --> 03:08:19,360
Interesting.

5010
03:08:19,680 --> 03:08:21,760
There's no way, because... Oh, wait, I just remembered.

5011
03:08:21,880 --> 03:08:23,600
This is a Valorant game, so...

5012
03:08:23,600 --> 03:08:24,500
GG's to red.

5013
03:08:24,620 --> 03:08:24,900
I guess.

5014
03:08:25,680 --> 03:08:27,380
I mean, we'll see.

5015
03:08:27,620 --> 03:08:29,340
Like, blue team's been cooking the entire event.

5016
03:08:29,540 --> 03:08:30,220
So this might be close.

5017
03:08:30,720 --> 03:08:34,040
No, they all play, like, all FPS, so...

5018
03:08:34,040 --> 03:08:34,720
Red is, like...

5019
03:08:34,720 --> 03:08:37,520
Red is, like, majority FPS, though.

5020
03:08:38,500 --> 03:08:39,880
I hope they take it.

5021
03:08:40,100 --> 03:08:41,260
Because, uh...

5022
03:08:41,760 --> 03:08:43,340
Sleepy and Red have been dealt dirty.

5023
03:08:43,680 --> 03:08:45,880
They have been, like, wanting to win so bad.

5024
03:08:46,160 --> 03:08:47,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

5025
03:08:50,490 --> 03:08:51,170
Let's see.

5026
03:08:56,600 --> 03:08:58,000
Okay, we're good.

5027
03:08:59,420 --> 03:08:59,840
So...

5028
03:08:59,840 --> 03:09:03,800
First place team gets to pick, like, what site they want to be on.

5029
03:09:03,840 --> 03:09:05,680
If they want to, like, start attack or start defense.

5030
03:09:05,680 --> 03:09:07,280
I want Red team to win.

5031
03:09:07,360 --> 03:09:08,220
I want Red team to win.

5032
03:09:11,300 --> 03:09:13,580
I feel like attacking is so much easier.

5033
03:09:14,560 --> 03:09:17,560
Uh, I mean, the map's been slightly weak the last time we played.

5034
03:09:17,760 --> 03:09:18,760
So then, I think it is.

5035
03:09:19,480 --> 03:09:21,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5036
03:09:22,920 --> 03:09:26,840
I don't actually remember what the lag issue was last time, but it has been fixed.

5037
03:09:27,900 --> 03:09:36,520
The guy who was 1v1ing was not an FPS player, because he fucking pushed me in a Valorant game, which is, like, the most stupid thing you could ever do.

5038
03:09:41,640 --> 03:09:45,680
The first rule of Valorant is that if you have the advantage, you don't push.

5039
03:09:45,820 --> 03:09:46,980
You just stay.

5040
03:09:47,720 --> 03:09:50,260
Until they push you, because then you have the free file.

5041
03:09:54,020 --> 03:09:55,100
Thank you for playing.

5042
03:09:55,200 --> 03:09:55,720
It was a lot of fun.

5043
03:09:55,820 --> 03:09:56,680
No worries, dude.

5044
03:09:56,980 --> 03:09:58,600
Thank you so much for joining.

5045
03:09:58,780 --> 03:10:00,060
Yeah, it was nice meeting you.

5046
03:10:00,420 --> 03:10:01,860
Fuck, I'm so angry.

5047
03:10:02,620 --> 03:10:03,680
Okay, thank you for playing.

5048
03:10:03,960 --> 03:10:04,420
See you guys later.

5049
03:10:04,740 --> 03:10:05,160
Bye!

5050
03:10:05,420 --> 03:10:05,880
Bye-bye!

5051
03:10:07,160 --> 03:10:10,200
Oh, hold on.

5052
03:10:10,360 --> 03:10:10,580
Oh, wait.

5053
03:10:10,760 --> 03:10:11,180
Wait a minute.

5054
03:10:11,340 --> 03:10:11,900
They're getting fucked.

5055
03:10:13,000 --> 03:10:14,700
They're actually getting fucked over.

5056
03:10:15,160 --> 03:10:18,020
I'm not gonna lie, blue team is, like, peeking out in the open.

5057
03:10:18,160 --> 03:10:19,140
Wait, actually, no.

5058
03:10:19,400 --> 03:10:20,100
No, they're fine.

5059
03:10:20,180 --> 03:10:20,620
They're fine.

5060
03:10:20,760 --> 03:10:25,220
Yeah, like, the Valorant players are playing Valorant.

5061
03:10:25,900 --> 03:10:31,900
Yeah, the thing is that the thing is that they didn't kill the Valorant players there.

5062
03:10:33,460 --> 03:10:36,660
The Valorant players literally just waited and then revived.

5063
03:10:37,360 --> 03:10:39,120
No, this is Valorant.

5064
03:10:39,920 --> 03:10:43,780
You can see the Valorant players literally just peeking.

5065
03:10:44,640 --> 03:10:47,060
Dude, that was crazy.

5066
03:10:48,620 --> 03:10:56,760
Yeah, that's why when he was, like, telling me to push, I didn't push because I knew I had the advantage because, like, I literally just had to wait until the bomb goes off.

5067
03:10:58,400 --> 03:11:02,400
So I was, like, when I was hearing push, I was just like, no, the bomb's gonna take down.

5068
03:11:02,840 --> 03:11:03,460
It doesn't matter.

5069
03:11:03,660 --> 03:11:04,660
They have no time to defuse.

5070
03:11:04,840 --> 03:11:06,060
I don't disagree with you.

5071
03:11:07,240 --> 03:11:09,100
They literally, they have...

5072
03:11:09,100 --> 03:11:09,660
Let's see.

5073
03:11:09,820 --> 03:11:11,220
They know what to do.

5074
03:11:13,120 --> 03:11:14,140
They just play slow.

5075
03:11:14,280 --> 03:11:16,020
That's why I fucking hate Valorant.

5076
03:11:16,100 --> 03:11:17,300
You just play slow and you win.

5077
03:11:18,840 --> 03:11:20,440
I have no patience for that.

5078
03:11:21,640 --> 03:11:21,940
Really?

5079
03:11:23,180 --> 03:11:24,680
Okay, who's the Valorant player?

5080
03:11:24,680 --> 03:11:25,380
I don't know.

5081
03:11:25,720 --> 03:11:28,180
Who's, like, the main Valorant player?

5082
03:11:28,760 --> 03:11:30,680
Like, she peeked in the open, so...

5083
03:11:31,380 --> 03:11:31,780
That's why.

5084
03:11:33,120 --> 03:11:35,560
Look, they already planted the bomb so they don't have to worry.

5085
03:11:35,920 --> 03:11:37,100
They just need to guard the bomb.

5086
03:11:38,580 --> 03:11:40,620
Oh, never mind.

5087
03:11:40,800 --> 03:11:40,980
Oh!

5088
03:11:42,100 --> 03:11:43,300
Wait a minute.

5089
03:11:43,640 --> 03:11:44,860
I did not expect...

5090
03:11:44,860 --> 03:11:46,520
I did not expect that to happen.

5091
03:11:47,500 --> 03:11:48,160
Blue takes his round.

5092
03:11:48,780 --> 03:11:49,220
Yeah.

5093
03:11:50,980 --> 03:11:51,420
Nuke?

5094
03:11:51,440 --> 03:11:52,060
Is it nuke?

5095
03:11:52,060 --> 03:11:53,760
Uh, no.

5096
03:11:53,760 --> 03:11:54,980
Oh, I had to turn around.

5097
03:11:55,300 --> 03:11:55,940
I don't remember.

5098
03:11:57,080 --> 03:11:58,460
This does not look like nuke.

5099
03:11:59,020 --> 03:12:00,860
B site's inferno, I think.

5100
03:12:00,860 --> 03:12:02,060
This does not look like...

5101
03:12:02,060 --> 03:12:04,160
B site's inferno.

5102
03:12:04,280 --> 03:12:05,380
I don't remember what...

5103
03:12:05,380 --> 03:12:07,640
A site might be cash, but I could be wrong.

5104
03:12:07,660 --> 03:12:08,100
I'm sad.

5105
03:12:08,240 --> 03:12:10,180
I missed my dance lessons today.

5106
03:12:11,460 --> 03:12:12,880
I feel bad.

5107
03:12:13,040 --> 03:12:15,700
My teacher was like, where are you?

5108
03:12:15,880 --> 03:12:17,620
And I was like, I'm sorry.

5109
03:12:17,700 --> 03:12:19,800
I told her I'd be late too.

5110
03:12:19,800 --> 03:12:22,540
But I didn't realize how late I was gonna be.

5111
03:12:22,800 --> 03:12:23,220
I've been up.

5112
03:12:23,400 --> 03:12:23,740
I'm up.

5113
03:12:23,980 --> 03:12:26,000
I was even, like, timing the set schedule.

5114
03:12:26,300 --> 03:12:26,700
Like, session.

5115
03:12:28,420 --> 03:12:29,260
Surprisingly enough.

5116
03:12:30,300 --> 03:12:30,900
Hold on.

5117
03:12:32,380 --> 03:12:33,900
Oh, Sandwich is down now.

5118
03:12:35,460 --> 03:12:37,100
The blue team carry is down.

5119
03:12:37,220 --> 03:12:38,520
Oh, Shira's, like, reviving.

5120
03:12:38,620 --> 03:12:39,340
I was like, I'm sorry.

5121
03:12:39,820 --> 03:12:40,300
Wait.

5122
03:12:43,040 --> 03:12:46,120
Guys, I'm not lying.

5123
03:12:46,420 --> 03:12:46,980
I'm up.

5124
03:12:46,980 --> 03:12:49,220
Oh, they're just fucking running.

5125
03:12:49,360 --> 03:12:49,940
They don't care.

5126
03:12:51,540 --> 03:12:53,080
They're just swarming.

5127
03:12:53,920 --> 03:12:54,560
This is crazy.

5128
03:12:54,840 --> 03:12:55,340
Hold on.

5129
03:12:56,300 --> 03:12:58,900
No, I didn't dox myself too.

5130
03:12:59,000 --> 03:13:01,840
This was a dance teacher that I didn't dox myself to.

5131
03:13:03,220 --> 03:13:05,020
So she doesn't know who I am.

5132
03:13:05,980 --> 03:13:10,380
I'm just kind of watching red, like, move across the map.

5133
03:13:11,660 --> 03:13:12,900
Oh, they're splitting.

5134
03:13:13,440 --> 03:13:13,720
Okay.

5135
03:13:13,720 --> 03:13:13,860
Alright.

5136
03:13:16,140 --> 03:13:16,340
Alright.

5137
03:13:16,740 --> 03:13:17,700
Where's Zek?

5138
03:13:18,860 --> 03:13:20,500
Was his name Zekko?

5139
03:13:21,040 --> 03:13:22,580
I can tell you that.

5140
03:13:23,520 --> 03:13:23,760
No.

5141
03:13:25,860 --> 03:13:26,460
They're playing.

5142
03:13:26,660 --> 03:13:27,420
Oh, they're defending.

5143
03:13:28,120 --> 03:13:29,160
Oh, what a shot.

5144
03:13:29,920 --> 03:13:30,300
Beautiful.

5145
03:13:32,060 --> 03:13:33,480
It's a final right now.

5146
03:13:33,620 --> 03:13:34,320
They're all fighting.

5147
03:13:34,880 --> 03:13:36,260
Like, blasted teams.

5148
03:13:38,220 --> 03:13:39,480
Who's the other guy?

5149
03:13:39,600 --> 03:13:40,220
Oh, there he is.

5150
03:13:40,680 --> 03:13:43,220
Blue needs to, like, push here, because they need to plant, I think.

5151
03:13:43,320 --> 03:13:45,360
Wait, who's attacking?

5152
03:13:47,460 --> 03:13:49,640
Blue needs to, like, plant there, like, bomb.

5153
03:13:50,940 --> 03:13:52,800
How are they playing this?

5154
03:13:53,080 --> 03:13:53,880
Red's got it on lock.

5155
03:13:56,600 --> 03:14:02,520
I know Sleepy is, like, what's the second highest rank in Valorant?

5156
03:14:02,620 --> 03:14:04,000
Because I know he's that rank.

5157
03:14:04,340 --> 03:14:05,660
I guess this is a red team set game, no?

5158
03:14:06,500 --> 03:14:07,780
That was so cocky.

5159
03:14:07,780 --> 03:14:08,960
Literally, they could just push him.

5160
03:14:11,500 --> 03:14:15,400
He told me he was, like, immortal.

5161
03:14:15,700 --> 03:14:17,220
Yeah, I know Sleepy is immortal.

5162
03:14:17,620 --> 03:14:18,320
Is he immortal?

5163
03:14:18,860 --> 03:14:19,980
Is the second highest immortal?

5164
03:14:20,740 --> 03:14:22,180
Is the one below top 500?

5165
03:14:24,420 --> 03:14:24,580
Okay.

5166
03:14:25,800 --> 03:14:28,100
Because I know he's that rank.

5167
03:14:28,420 --> 03:14:30,320
Sleepy is, like, immortal in Valorant.

5168
03:14:31,140 --> 03:14:34,360
Because I remember last time I talked to him, he was immortal.

5169
03:14:34,360 --> 03:14:35,820
Red's on the attack.

5170
03:14:36,700 --> 03:14:40,680
Yes, they have the world champion and also an immortal Valor player.

5171
03:14:45,460 --> 03:14:49,100
Wait, hold on.

5172
03:14:49,300 --> 03:14:51,320
Who's... Oh, Zekken's, like, full-pushing mid.

5173
03:14:51,360 --> 03:14:51,960
What the fuck?

5174
03:14:52,440 --> 03:14:53,560
He's that confident.

5175
03:14:54,580 --> 03:14:55,920
He's got that dog in him.

5176
03:14:56,160 --> 03:14:59,600
He knows he's got that world championship under his belt.

5177
03:15:00,480 --> 03:15:01,380
They're all on B.

5178
03:15:01,460 --> 03:15:02,360
Do they know how to...

5179
03:15:02,360 --> 03:15:03,280
Do they know they need to play?

5180
03:15:03,380 --> 03:15:04,340
Oh, Sean's got it.

5181
03:15:04,600 --> 03:15:04,900
Huge.

5182
03:15:05,320 --> 03:15:06,640
Oh, the flank.

5183
03:15:07,260 --> 03:15:08,900
Oh, the flank's been shut down.

5184
03:15:09,060 --> 03:15:09,700
I think Red takes it.

5185
03:15:09,720 --> 03:15:11,700
That's overconfidence there.

5186
03:15:11,960 --> 03:15:12,860
Nevermind, nevermind, nevermind.

5187
03:15:13,000 --> 03:15:13,820
Oh, he still got it.

5188
03:15:14,000 --> 03:15:14,400
Yay!

5189
03:15:15,460 --> 03:15:15,840
GG.

5190
03:15:16,560 --> 03:15:18,200
That was a fast one.

5191
03:15:19,080 --> 03:15:19,620
That was a fast one.

5192
03:15:19,620 --> 03:15:20,660
That was super fast.

5193
03:15:20,860 --> 03:15:21,700
I mean... Holy shit.

5194
03:15:23,020 --> 03:15:24,320
Sense it up.

5195
03:15:25,660 --> 03:15:31,000
Not only did they win the Valor championships, they also won Rookies 3.

5196
03:15:31,780 --> 03:15:34,120
Put that in their Liquipedia right now.

5197
03:15:34,740 --> 03:15:36,360
Is there Liquipedia for Minecraft?

5198
03:15:37,880 --> 03:15:38,740
Bye, guys.

5199
03:15:39,460 --> 03:15:40,060
GG's.

5200
03:15:40,060 --> 03:15:41,800
That was fun, yeah.

5201
03:15:41,900 --> 03:15:43,040
GG's, everybody.

5202
03:15:43,800 --> 03:15:44,400
GG's.

5203
03:15:44,400 --> 03:15:45,440
It was nice meeting you.

5204
03:15:45,640 --> 03:15:46,020
Yeah.

5205
03:15:46,340 --> 03:15:47,160
GG's, guys.

5206
03:15:47,640 --> 03:15:49,100
It was nice talking to you again, Doki.

5207
03:15:49,540 --> 03:15:49,940
Yeah.

5208
03:15:51,680 --> 03:15:53,180
You're 39th place?

5209
03:15:54,700 --> 03:15:55,540
39th place?

5210
03:15:55,640 --> 03:15:56,440
Yeah, what the fuck, bro?

5211
03:15:56,480 --> 03:15:57,100
What's my subscription?

5212
03:15:57,100 --> 03:15:59,440
Alright, I'll subscribe to you.

5213
03:15:59,480 --> 03:16:00,600
Wait, are you gonna subscribe to me?

5214
03:16:00,740 --> 03:16:01,540
I can literally check.

5215
03:16:01,560 --> 03:16:02,000
I am!

5216
03:16:02,280 --> 03:16:05,340
I literally get your fucking shorts all the fucking time.

5217
03:16:06,880 --> 03:16:09,540
I even get notifications for your fucking shorts.

5218
03:16:09,820 --> 03:16:10,460
Oh, thanks, man.

5219
03:16:11,420 --> 03:16:13,780
Yeah, but I don't see a comment on it.

5220
03:16:13,840 --> 03:16:15,220
How was I supposed to know?

5221
03:16:15,240 --> 03:16:17,600
Bro, what the fuck am I gonna be commenting them on, man?

5222
03:16:17,720 --> 03:16:18,360
I like that.

5223
03:16:18,760 --> 03:16:21,660
Give me one comment so I'll know if you're actually subscribed.

5224
03:16:21,960 --> 03:16:22,400
Give me one.

5225
03:16:26,560 --> 03:16:27,480
GG's, guys.

5226
03:16:28,320 --> 03:16:28,940
GG's, guys.

5227
03:16:28,940 --> 03:16:30,400
GG's, I'll subscribe to you after this.

5228
03:16:30,600 --> 03:16:31,160
GG's.

5229
03:16:32,400 --> 03:16:33,280
Alright, everyone.

5230
03:16:34,040 --> 03:16:34,960
Thank you for having me.

5231
03:16:35,080 --> 03:16:36,400
I would love to participate again.

5232
03:16:36,480 --> 03:16:37,120
This was really fun.

5233
03:16:38,500 --> 03:16:39,820
Yeah, thank you.

5234
03:16:40,100 --> 03:16:40,620
Bye-bye.

5235
03:16:41,160 --> 03:16:43,560
Bye-bye.

5236
03:16:44,020 --> 03:16:44,660
Bye-bye.

5237
03:16:45,140 --> 03:16:46,140
That was fun.

5238
03:16:46,820 --> 03:16:47,220
Membership.

5239
03:16:50,360 --> 03:16:51,800
Yeah, that was fun.

5240
03:16:52,020 --> 03:16:58,880
I had to change my mindset of how it was gonna go after the first game, because I was like, oh, wait, this is not as competitive.

5241
03:17:00,660 --> 03:17:06,380
The first one was super competitive, so I was like, okay, how are we feeling here?

5242
03:17:06,720 --> 03:17:10,920
I think it didn't help that I was also very introverted there, too.

5243
03:17:13,020 --> 03:17:18,200
I think I got more comfortable as the games go on.

5244
03:17:18,640 --> 03:17:20,200
Wait, let me...

5245
03:17:20,200 --> 03:17:24,420
I don't know if I'm supposed to still go to dance class.

5246
03:17:27,660 --> 03:17:33,140
Are you still free today for a lesson?

5247
03:17:34,160 --> 03:17:37,660
I just finished work.

5248
03:17:37,660 --> 03:17:43,140
It went overtime because people were late.

5249
03:17:43,680 --> 03:17:51,400
40 minutes late to start the session.

5250
03:17:55,660 --> 03:17:57,600
People were late.

5251
03:17:59,600 --> 03:18:01,340
I really want...

5252
03:18:01,340 --> 03:18:04,780
I really want to go to dance lessons.

5253
03:18:08,400 --> 03:18:09,040
Please.

5254
03:18:11,360 --> 03:18:13,740
She's still charging me for money for it.

5255
03:18:17,460 --> 03:18:18,400
We'll see.

5256
03:18:18,640 --> 03:18:20,380
We'll see how it goes.

5257
03:18:20,520 --> 03:18:21,480
We'll see how it goes.

5258
03:18:21,560 --> 03:18:26,240
I definitely timed things wrong there.

5259
03:18:28,560 --> 03:18:30,600
I don't want to be like...

5260
03:18:31,940 --> 03:18:33,980
Sorry, teacher.

5261
03:18:34,220 --> 03:18:36,000
I was playing Minecraft.

5262
03:18:37,660 --> 03:18:38,060
Sorry.

5263
03:18:39,580 --> 03:18:41,260
I don't want to say that.

5264
03:18:41,420 --> 03:18:42,700
That's sad.

5265
03:18:43,120 --> 03:18:44,940
She knows I stream.

5266
03:18:45,080 --> 03:18:46,840
She was asking me...

5267
03:18:46,840 --> 03:18:50,400
She was like, I don't want to pry too much because...

5268
03:18:51,060 --> 03:18:55,780
I don't want to pry too much because I don't know if you want to be private about what you do.

5269
03:18:56,340 --> 03:18:58,100
I was like, do you watch streamers?

5270
03:18:58,220 --> 03:18:59,020
She was like, yeah.

5271
03:18:59,140 --> 03:19:00,380
I love SlimeSicle.

5272
03:19:00,540 --> 03:19:02,460
I think she's a Minecrafter.

5273
03:19:02,460 --> 03:19:06,460
That is exactly why I don't say who I am because I think she might know.

5274
03:19:10,440 --> 03:19:14,860
She was like, yeah, my favorite streamers are SlimeSicle and Jslatt.

5275
03:19:15,160 --> 03:19:19,640
Which, to be fair, Jslatt started off as a Minecrafter, but now he's like super variety.

5276
03:19:20,060 --> 03:19:21,000
But I'm pretty sure...

5277
03:19:21,000 --> 03:19:24,280
I think SlimeSicle is like full of Minecrafter, right?

5278
03:19:26,800 --> 03:19:28,580
Is that... No, she doesn't know.

5279
03:19:28,840 --> 03:19:29,700
She doesn't know.

5280
03:19:29,780 --> 03:19:31,960
SlimeSicle and Jslatt is not here!

5281
03:19:32,840 --> 03:19:35,640
They're not even in this fucking lobby!

5282
03:19:37,200 --> 03:19:38,320
She doesn't know.

5283
03:19:38,440 --> 03:19:39,280
She doesn't fucking know.

5284
03:19:39,360 --> 03:19:39,940
I never told her.

5285
03:19:40,220 --> 03:19:45,740
Like, even the songs we use to do the dance lessons, it's like the original songs.

5286
03:19:46,240 --> 03:19:49,000
So like, Mint and I haven't recorded the songs yet.

5287
03:19:49,320 --> 03:19:51,600
So we're just dancing to the original.

5288
03:19:52,140 --> 03:19:56,360
So like, I'm just hoping that like, I don't think I'm going to tell her who I am.

5289
03:19:56,400 --> 03:19:58,920
She just knows that I'm a...

5290
03:19:58,920 --> 03:20:02,120
She knows that I may or may not be a big streamer.

5291
03:20:02,240 --> 03:20:03,020
That's really it.

5292
03:20:03,080 --> 03:20:03,680
Or not big!

5293
03:20:03,820 --> 03:20:04,700
Just like a...

5294
03:20:04,700 --> 03:20:06,060
Just a streamer.

5295
03:20:06,320 --> 03:20:08,820
I just told her that I have... I do a lot.

5296
03:20:08,960 --> 03:20:11,420
I work with... I have a lot of work stuff.

5297
03:20:11,900 --> 03:20:13,420
And that like...

5298
03:20:17,040 --> 03:20:18,900
I'm not gonna tell her!

5299
03:20:19,040 --> 03:20:23,440
I'm not... Okay, the other dance teacher I accidentally doxed myself.

5300
03:20:23,820 --> 03:20:24,960
So she like...

5301
03:20:24,960 --> 03:20:30,080
She like subscribed to my YouTube channel, and now her children knows what I do.

5302
03:20:30,440 --> 03:20:32,840
So like, that was a little oopsie.

5303
03:20:32,940 --> 03:20:35,020
Cause her children were like, oh my god!

5304
03:20:35,120 --> 03:20:36,660
Doki Bridge, she's famous!

5305
03:20:37,260 --> 03:20:38,700
And she was telling me about it.

5306
03:20:38,720 --> 03:20:40,340
And I was like, oh fuck, okay.

5307
03:20:41,040 --> 03:20:41,520
That's...

5308
03:20:42,780 --> 03:20:45,580
So luckily, her kids don't know what I look like.

5309
03:20:46,680 --> 03:20:47,640
Like outside.

5310
03:20:47,900 --> 03:20:50,680
They don't know that I'm truly a tomato on the inside.

5311
03:20:50,960 --> 03:20:52,880
They just know that I look like this.

5312
03:20:53,120 --> 03:20:55,180
So luckily, her kids don't.

5313
03:20:55,320 --> 03:20:56,920
Cause apparently her daughter...

5314
03:20:56,920 --> 03:20:57,440
You know what?

5315
03:20:57,600 --> 03:20:59,120
I'm low-key like...

5316
03:21:00,100 --> 03:21:00,660
Hey!

5317
03:21:01,820 --> 03:21:06,540
The daughter of the dance teacher, if you're watching this right now, I know you're a gay.

5318
03:21:06,620 --> 03:21:10,940
Apparently her... the dance teacher was like, oh...

5319
03:21:12,160 --> 03:21:17,260
So if you're watching this, the child of my dance teacher is watching this right now.

5320
03:21:20,820 --> 03:21:22,340
She was like...

5321
03:21:22,340 --> 03:21:28,060
She was like really wanted to show her kid me.

5322
03:21:28,480 --> 03:21:33,420
Because she was like, oh, my daughter, she's a gamer too.

5323
03:21:33,660 --> 03:21:34,400
Like, oh my god.

5324
03:21:34,500 --> 03:21:37,460
She loves playing like video games and stuff.

5325
03:21:37,740 --> 03:21:39,000
And she's like, should I get her?

5326
03:21:39,120 --> 03:21:42,000
Like, oh yeah, what's the difference between a Mac and a PC?

5327
03:21:42,520 --> 03:21:44,760
Why do gamers like using PCs?

5328
03:21:44,980 --> 03:21:48,480
And I'm like, because graphically, it's better.

5329
03:21:48,700 --> 03:21:50,240
And there's more games on PC.

5330
03:21:50,240 --> 03:21:55,340
And she's like, yeah, my daughter, she's been asking me to get her a PC.

5331
03:21:55,460 --> 03:21:58,500
And I was so surprised because I was like, but Mac's more expensive.

5332
03:21:58,640 --> 03:21:59,720
Why would you want a PC?

5333
03:22:00,360 --> 03:22:03,120
And then, I was just like, well, there's games on PC.

5334
03:22:03,300 --> 03:22:06,360
And like, graphically wise, it's just better.

5335
03:22:06,520 --> 03:22:10,260
Like, you usually use Mac for like, editing or like, music and stuff.

5336
03:22:10,580 --> 03:22:14,020
So like, anyway, so her daughter knows who I am now.

5337
03:22:14,160 --> 03:22:17,000
So, if you're watching this, you're...

5338
03:22:20,240 --> 03:22:24,000
If you're watching this, don't tell anyone, buddy, like...

5339
03:22:26,580 --> 03:22:31,400
Don't tell people what province and city we are in.

5340
03:22:35,930 --> 03:22:39,330
Like a child, I swear to God, child, if you...

5341
03:22:39,330 --> 03:22:40,730
Oh, I know where you live.

5342
03:22:43,150 --> 03:22:46,490
Just remember, child, I know where you live.

5343
03:22:52,530 --> 03:22:55,110
Don't keep chill.

5344
03:22:57,830 --> 03:23:00,670
The river stops.

5345
03:23:01,190 --> 03:23:02,650
Not absurd by the way.

5346
03:23:03,570 --> 03:23:06,850
It's jokey threatening a child.

5347
03:23:09,710 --> 03:23:12,230
Mutually assured destruction.

5348
03:23:14,870 --> 03:23:18,830
Anyway, so my other dance teacher, the one I missed a session today,

5349
03:23:22,630 --> 03:23:23,050
um...

5350
03:23:25,810 --> 03:23:26,650
I am...

5351
03:23:26,650 --> 03:23:33,870
Actually, no, I'm not planning on telling her, because like she was like, oh my God, you like League?

5352
03:23:33,950 --> 03:23:35,650
She's like, a semi-gamer.

5353
03:23:35,890 --> 03:23:37,710
She's like, oh yeah, I love playing...

5354
03:23:37,710 --> 03:23:39,270
I know, that's a...

5355
03:23:39,950 --> 03:23:52,550
There's no saving her, but she likes playing League and was talking about Arcane and stuff to me, and I was like, oh fuck, because I'm friends with people who are like League streamers, or like, well known in the League streaming community, so I was just like,

5356
03:23:52,690 --> 03:23:53,130
uh-huh?

5357
03:23:54,810 --> 03:23:58,850
Like, like like Lili Pichu and like Sykkuno, and I'm like, mhm.

5358
03:23:59,250 --> 03:24:01,290
And then...

5359
03:24:02,650 --> 03:24:14,550
So I'm just like, because she's like, younger, she doesn't, like, she's like the dance teacher is a lot younger, and because she's a lot younger, she doesn't know, like, like she obviously is more, she knows Twitch, and so she's like, do you stream on Twitch?

5360
03:24:14,610 --> 03:24:17,110
I was like, no, I don't stream on Twitch, I'm a YouTuber.

5361
03:24:17,110 --> 03:24:21,690
And then that was like the most I gave her, like...

5362
03:24:21,690 --> 03:24:27,190
Oh my god.

5363
03:24:27,850 --> 03:24:40,030
Anyway, so yeah, um, I hope I can get my dance lessons today, because like, it's today and tomorrow, and then like, it's trying to hope to God everything goes okay.

5364
03:24:40,030 --> 03:24:40,170
Okay.

5365
03:24:45,590 --> 03:24:55,230
Sadly, I don't know where the other dance teacher lives, because like, I know where the one that accidentally doxxed myself lived, because I was doing dance lessons at her place.

5366
03:24:55,590 --> 03:25:01,530
So the daughter of the dance teacher, just remember, we gotta keep each other safe.

5367
03:25:07,590 --> 03:25:10,650
We gotta keep each other safe.

5368
03:25:12,690 --> 03:25:14,870
We gotta keep each other safe.

5369
03:25:15,190 --> 03:25:18,470
We have a little agreement here.

5370
03:25:20,270 --> 03:25:21,750
Doxxing is a no-no.

5371
03:25:22,030 --> 03:25:22,950
You gotta learn.

5372
03:25:23,170 --> 03:25:24,710
No doxxing.

5373
03:25:33,630 --> 03:25:35,450
Anyway, um, it was fun.

5374
03:25:35,610 --> 03:25:43,430
Um, I think like, definitely, I think I might message Wolfie this, but like, for rookies, like, oh my god.

5375
03:25:43,570 --> 03:25:51,110
Like, the only, I think like, I did really well this time around, because um, like, I just need to play it once, and then I figure it out.

5376
03:25:51,390 --> 03:25:55,270
Like, I need to play the games like, once, and then everything just clicks for me.

5377
03:25:55,430 --> 03:26:01,850
Because I remember like, I was so bad at aiming, and I was so bad at like, the parkour and the races and everything.

5378
03:26:03,350 --> 03:26:08,750
And then, and the first time I played it, and then here, I actually figured it out so fast.

5379
03:26:08,790 --> 03:26:14,570
I was just like, oh okay, like, I've done this before, so I was just like, like, in my head, I was just like, bam.

5380
03:26:15,210 --> 03:26:16,370
Um, it was easier.

5381
03:26:16,890 --> 03:26:23,750
And, uh, but then like, oh my god, that course, the, that, the fucking, what was it?

5382
03:26:23,830 --> 03:26:34,090
The different parkours, um, the different parkour, and the trident, like, that shit like, not pissed me off, but like, it was so difficult.

5383
03:26:34,490 --> 03:26:39,090
Because like, I don't know the mechanics of it, especially for like, beginners.

5384
03:26:39,290 --> 03:26:42,830
And then the inter, the intermediates were so difficult.

5385
03:26:43,430 --> 03:26:50,210
Cause like, like, Wolfie was like, oh yeah, we lowered the, the difficulty level for, yeah, it was very frustrating.

5386
03:26:54,460 --> 03:26:55,500
Very frustrating.

5387
03:26:55,680 --> 03:27:04,500
And I felt like, um, I felt like, um, a lot of the mechanics were like, it was, like, the intermediate was so hard.

5388
03:27:05,200 --> 03:27:08,280
Like, when Wolfie was like, yeah, we lowered the difficulty for it.

5389
03:27:08,340 --> 03:27:09,940
And I was like, what?

5390
03:27:11,700 --> 03:27:12,760
I did the intermediate?

5391
03:27:13,200 --> 03:27:14,420
No, you should be able to do intermediate.

5392
03:27:14,600 --> 03:27:17,410
And I was trying to do it, I was like, what the fuck?

5393
03:27:17,940 --> 03:27:21,200
This is, this was a lower difficulty?

5394
03:27:22,760 --> 03:27:29,940
Like, like, it was like, beginner, and then the fucking difficulty scaled to like an 8.

5395
03:27:33,740 --> 03:27:43,000
I was just like, and I just felt like, I felt like I might, like, I feel like for rookies that was so difficult to play in general for rookies.

5396
03:27:43,180 --> 03:27:51,960
I think there was some, I think, also cause like, you know, like I said, I played it before, so like, it was very easy for me to like, have things click in place.

5397
03:27:52,500 --> 03:27:54,620
Um, yeah.

5398
03:27:55,760 --> 03:28:09,260
Um, and like, I never, I don't do Trident stuff, like I never used a Trident in actual normal Minecraft, so um, so it was all about like, things you have to, you have to have knowledge before to be able to do correctly.

5399
03:28:09,900 --> 03:28:23,760
Um, yeah, yeah, it was like, I was just like so confused and everything, but I think that definitely for rookies needs to have a lower difficulty or like, a place for people to practice or something, or just like, a video.

5400
03:28:24,400 --> 03:28:32,920
Like, just something that tells you what to do for each section cause like, I was so, I was so confused for each section.

5401
03:28:34,240 --> 03:28:34,760
Yeah.

5402
03:28:35,180 --> 03:28:37,060
Yeah, so I'm happy I did pretty well.

5403
03:28:37,480 --> 03:28:45,300
I think like, if I had points, I think if like, we had points from the first game, we would have definitely been like, top 15.

5404
03:28:46,000 --> 03:28:51,800
Like, we had no points from the first game, so um, um, and like, I had so much loot on me.

5405
03:28:52,040 --> 03:29:02,320
I had so much loot on me, and I think if I had, like, if I like, deposited all my loot, I would have been 15th place at least, at most, for the, from the first game.

5406
03:29:02,700 --> 03:29:06,620
And we did pretty well, 5th place for not having the first game points.

5407
03:29:07,400 --> 03:29:12,460
Uh, and I was fucking gaming today.

5408
03:29:13,040 --> 03:29:22,120
I was gaming, and I I locked in, and I was trying very hard to make friends, and I tried my best.

5409
03:29:22,380 --> 03:29:23,680
I tried.

5410
03:29:24,700 --> 03:29:29,580
Social anxiety didn't win today.

5411
03:29:34,720 --> 03:29:40,140
Yes, I I out anxiety'd social anxiety.

5412
03:29:40,140 --> 03:29:40,440
I out anxiety'd social anxiety.

5413
03:29:44,340 --> 03:29:46,200
We did it, guys.

5414
03:29:47,020 --> 03:29:52,420
I Um, also cause there was a lot of people.

5415
03:29:52,640 --> 03:29:54,820
I break down when there's too many people.

5416
03:29:55,040 --> 03:30:05,180
Like, if it's three of us, like, I don't know if some of you guys are like, oh, but like, you're able to make new friends if it's like, like, a smaller Yeah, I could do okay in a smaller group.

5417
03:30:05,320 --> 03:30:17,560
Cause then, like, we're all new and then we're like, like, we're all slowly getting to know each other, but there was like, five of us, and I was just like, that's a lot of people.

5418
03:30:18,040 --> 03:30:23,900
That's a lot of, there's a lot of people to, to, to, to talk to.

5419
03:30:25,600 --> 03:30:26,680
What makes you nervous?

5420
03:30:26,820 --> 03:30:32,020
It's not who, it's more so, it's like, I don't know any of them very well.

5421
03:30:32,980 --> 03:30:37,800
Like, I think like, Demi and Line, very first time I talked to them.

5422
03:30:38,320 --> 03:30:44,300
Hakka, I've only talked to him during the WrestleTubers stuff, was the only time I've ever talked to him.

5423
03:30:46,000 --> 03:30:56,900
And even then, like, it was like, I was a caster, so, there wasn't really much, like, actual talking to, and I never really got a chance to actually know him.

5424
03:30:57,020 --> 03:31:04,160
And then, like, Wolfie, only during that Block Wars session, like, last Block Wars session that I've talked to him.

5425
03:31:05,380 --> 03:31:27,820
So, it was like, it was like, like, because there was so much, like, uncertainty and stuff, so it was like, harder for me, personally, to, to, like, not, I don't want to say open up, but it's more so, like, just, like, be more of, you know, faking the extroversion.

5426
03:31:35,840 --> 03:31:39,420
Like, being, like, an extrovert at that time.

5427
03:31:41,720 --> 03:31:42,440
You know?

5428
03:31:43,360 --> 03:31:47,540
I'm just so used to, yeah, I fake it till you make it.

5429
03:31:47,580 --> 03:31:48,560
That's basically me.

5430
03:31:48,580 --> 03:31:51,060
I'm a full-on, I'm a full-on introvert.

5431
03:31:51,600 --> 03:31:56,440
And that's why I was like, you guys are, like, you're, like, emotional support animal.

5432
03:31:56,940 --> 03:32:06,300
You guys are, like, my emotional support animal, and that's why I was, like, muting to talk to you guys, just so I get, like, less anxious about, uh, talking to people.

5433
03:32:06,680 --> 03:32:19,540
Because, like, I'm talking to you guys and it's, like, there's, like, it's not, like, a void, but, like, um, you guys are just absorbing what I say and, like, uh, I can choose not to, I choose not to accept what you say.

5434
03:32:22,140 --> 03:32:23,640
No, I'm joking.

5435
03:32:24,020 --> 03:32:28,520
I could just look away.

5436
03:32:32,920 --> 03:32:39,320
You guys are my emotional support dragoons, and, like, I could just look away.

5437
03:32:40,660 --> 03:32:45,920
No, emotional support dragoons!

5438
03:32:46,720 --> 03:32:52,000
So it's easier to just when the void talks back.

5439
03:32:55,620 --> 03:32:59,460
When you give me feedback that I don't like, I could be, like...

5440
03:33:00,960 --> 03:33:03,320
I close my eyes.

5441
03:33:08,020 --> 03:33:14,600
When you tell me things that I know is right but I refuse to accept it, I just go...

5442
03:33:20,920 --> 03:33:29,280
Um, but, like I said, it's, like, easier to talk to you guys, because, like, it's just easier versus, like, some people that, like, one-on-one interactions.

5443
03:33:31,820 --> 03:33:35,540
And, like, I definitely feel much more comfortable.

5444
03:33:35,880 --> 03:33:36,900
Also, I can talk.

5445
03:33:37,240 --> 03:33:39,780
Also, by the way, you guys were wondering, like, Doki, why are you still here?

5446
03:33:40,120 --> 03:33:41,620
Like, I'll just stop moving.

5447
03:33:41,740 --> 03:33:42,100
I'm sorry.

5448
03:33:42,200 --> 03:33:43,960
I'm, like, I like to move.

5449
03:33:44,160 --> 03:33:44,940
I should be here.

5450
03:33:46,880 --> 03:33:49,540
I'm just so...

5451
03:33:49,540 --> 03:33:52,880
I'm just really, really...

5452
03:33:52,880 --> 03:33:55,960
Oh my gosh, I'm just more used to talking to people in a smaller group.

5453
03:33:57,340 --> 03:34:00,520
Alright, let me double-check my text messages.

5454
03:34:03,060 --> 03:34:03,700
Oh...

5455
03:34:03,700 --> 03:34:04,920
Oh, no!

5456
03:34:06,140 --> 03:34:08,600
Dance teacher is super busy today.

5457
03:34:08,980 --> 03:34:10,280
She's super busy.

5458
03:34:11,200 --> 03:34:14,060
So, I have dance lessons tomorrow.

5459
03:34:14,060 --> 03:34:14,920
Tomorrow...

5460
03:34:15,800 --> 03:34:20,740
It's gonna be a three-plus hour or four-plus hour session.

5461
03:34:21,020 --> 03:34:23,060
So, I have time with you guys before my next stream.

5462
03:34:25,900 --> 03:34:26,460
Yeah...

5463
03:34:26,460 --> 03:34:27,760
It was my fault, though.

5464
03:34:27,940 --> 03:34:29,600
I overbooked myself.

5465
03:34:30,920 --> 03:34:34,440
I overbooked myself and, like, I didn't time it correctly.

5466
03:34:34,980 --> 03:34:38,100
I didn't time the stuff correctly.

5467
03:34:38,600 --> 03:34:40,380
So, it is what it is.

5468
03:34:40,400 --> 03:34:41,020
It's a lesson.

5469
03:34:41,120 --> 03:34:44,060
I shouldn't have overbooked myself today or...

5470
03:34:44,060 --> 03:34:47,080
Cause, like, that was the only time slot for her.

5471
03:34:47,500 --> 03:34:50,060
And I was like, oh, I can make it, but I didn't time it correctly.

5472
03:34:50,200 --> 03:34:51,280
So, it's just like...

5473
03:34:51,280 --> 03:34:52,500
It's a lesson to me.

5474
03:34:55,080 --> 03:34:55,440
Um...

5475
03:34:55,440 --> 03:34:56,760
Gabby, thank you for the super chat.

5476
03:34:56,840 --> 03:34:57,700
Thank you, thank you.

5477
03:34:57,820 --> 03:34:59,460
Makimo over here, thank you for the super chat.

5478
03:34:59,540 --> 03:35:00,520
Thank you, thank you.

5479
03:35:02,400 --> 03:35:03,120
What else?

5480
03:35:03,220 --> 03:35:03,680
What else?

5481
03:35:03,860 --> 03:35:06,120
I can actually read super chats now.

5482
03:35:06,140 --> 03:35:06,800
Oh my god.

5483
03:35:07,900 --> 03:35:10,820
Okay, uh... Chester, thank you for favorite super chat.

5484
03:35:10,940 --> 03:35:11,540
Thank you.

5485
03:35:11,540 --> 03:35:13,300
Thank you, thank you.

5486
03:35:13,940 --> 03:35:15,260
Mark, thank you for the super chat.

5487
03:35:15,340 --> 03:35:16,120
Thank you, thank you.

5488
03:35:17,260 --> 03:35:18,500
Rest in peace, Doki.

5489
03:35:18,960 --> 03:35:22,380
Died when her social battery fell to zero after two plus weeks of doing stuff.

5490
03:35:22,440 --> 03:35:23,140
Thank you for the super chat.

5491
03:35:23,220 --> 03:35:24,140
Thank you, thank you.

5492
03:35:24,360 --> 03:35:26,700
I have a lot of energy in general.

5493
03:35:27,760 --> 03:35:29,860
Um... It's just like...

5494
03:35:29,860 --> 03:35:37,520
Like, it's always funny that people don't know that I have a lot of introvertism.

5495
03:35:38,600 --> 03:35:41,340
Every time I tell people, like, yeah, I'm an introvert.

5496
03:35:41,640 --> 03:35:43,860
Like, people are like, what?

5497
03:35:48,340 --> 03:35:48,860
People...

5498
03:35:49,500 --> 03:35:54,160
don't know that I'm actually a huge introvert.

5499
03:35:54,400 --> 03:35:56,180
Also, didn't we get fifth place?

5500
03:35:56,980 --> 03:35:58,720
I thought we got fifth overall.

5501
03:36:00,420 --> 03:36:04,080
Haka, like, fucking added us and was like, we got fourth.

5502
03:36:04,320 --> 03:36:05,620
I'm pretty sure we were fifth.

5503
03:36:06,020 --> 03:36:07,500
Oh, I won't tell him that.

5504
03:36:07,640 --> 03:36:09,700
I don't want...

5505
03:36:10,720 --> 03:36:13,200
He thinks we got fourth place, guys.

5506
03:36:13,320 --> 03:36:14,860
Don't break his spirit.

5507
03:36:17,340 --> 03:36:19,380
Don't let him believe it.

5508
03:36:24,340 --> 03:36:26,300
Don't ruin his dreams, guys.

5509
03:36:27,200 --> 03:36:27,820
Oh, that's neat.

5510
03:36:27,900 --> 03:36:28,880
Thank you for the super chat.

5511
03:36:28,980 --> 03:36:30,120
Thank you, thank you.

5512
03:36:30,400 --> 03:36:31,000
Hi, Doki.

5513
03:36:31,040 --> 03:36:33,400
For a while, I was convinced I couldn't make it to the Phantom Thief concert.

5514
03:36:33,400 --> 03:36:34,720
But I was able to shift things around.

5515
03:36:34,840 --> 03:36:35,300
Now I'm going.

5516
03:36:35,420 --> 03:36:37,100
I'm so excited to support you and me and the other guests.

5517
03:36:37,220 --> 03:36:37,820
Thank you for the super chat.

5518
03:36:37,900 --> 03:36:38,440
Thank you, thank you.

5519
03:36:38,440 --> 03:36:39,680
Yeah, I'm super excited.

5520
03:36:40,320 --> 03:36:43,420
I'm so nervous for the concert.

5521
03:36:43,500 --> 03:36:44,840
It's gonna be my first concert.

5522
03:36:45,540 --> 03:36:48,000
Not my first recording, but my first concert.

5523
03:36:48,320 --> 03:36:57,500
I'm always really nervous about the dance because I've had less prep time regarding dance lessons for this one.

5524
03:36:57,740 --> 03:36:59,560
But I have more songs.

5525
03:37:00,220 --> 03:37:00,620
So...

5526
03:37:00,620 --> 03:37:00,840
Whoa!

5527
03:37:02,240 --> 03:37:04,480
So I'm super nervous.

5528
03:37:04,700 --> 03:37:08,000
That's why I've been grinding really hard on the lessons.

5529
03:37:08,700 --> 03:37:13,500
Because I really want you guys to have a really good time watching.

5530
03:37:15,120 --> 03:37:17,420
So I've been grinding really hard on the lessons.

5531
03:37:17,780 --> 03:37:22,340
I know I shouldn't overdo it, but I want you guys to have...

5532
03:37:22,340 --> 03:37:24,680
Because you're paying so much to...

5533
03:37:24,680 --> 03:37:32,860
You guys are paying so much to to come to the concert, especially because there's no streaming tickets too.

5534
03:37:33,400 --> 03:37:37,020
So I want those who are able to make it to have a really good time.

5535
03:37:37,520 --> 03:37:46,180
But we are gonna upload the individual performances as well to the individual performances on YouTube.

5536
03:37:46,340 --> 03:37:49,200
Not all of them, but two of them.

5537
03:37:49,280 --> 03:37:52,780
We'll have two of them that we'll upload on our end.

5538
03:37:53,720 --> 03:38:00,120
So people who weren't able to make it will at least see two of the individual performances that Mint and I are gonna upload.

5539
03:38:00,240 --> 03:38:03,160
So she'll have one on her channel and I'll have one on my channel.

5540
03:38:03,680 --> 03:38:05,160
So there's that.

5541
03:38:06,560 --> 03:38:08,040
Oh my gosh, it's so stressful.

5542
03:38:08,500 --> 03:38:19,460
Dance lessons is so stressful because it's like... I don't dance, but I want to improve if I get... I don't know.

5543
03:38:19,540 --> 03:38:22,200
I also don't know if I'll ever get another chance to do concerts too.

5544
03:38:24,260 --> 03:38:26,260
It's like, you know, I'm not...

5545
03:38:27,020 --> 03:38:28,540
My dance teacher keeps...

5546
03:38:28,540 --> 03:38:34,740
Okay, so like the one I doxed myself to, she was like, I was listening to you singing and you sing so well.

5547
03:38:34,860 --> 03:38:36,240
And I was like, that's not true.

5548
03:38:37,660 --> 03:38:38,580
That's not true.

5549
03:38:38,740 --> 03:38:41,700
I've seen people on the internet call my singing...

5550
03:38:45,060 --> 03:38:50,340
I'm just like thinking no, even if they're not... I've seen people on the internet

5551
03:38:55,920 --> 03:38:57,500
call my singing and I was like, you know what, I'm not singing.

5552
03:38:59,420 --> 03:39:00,060
I'm just...

5553
03:39:04,400 --> 03:39:06,220
I'm just like, no, don't say that.

5554
03:39:06,500 --> 03:39:07,780
Don't say that.

5555
03:39:12,320 --> 03:39:13,540
Nali, thank you for the superchat.

5556
03:39:13,660 --> 03:39:14,700
Thank you.

5557
03:39:15,260 --> 03:39:16,460
We're not real, we're just voices.

5558
03:39:16,460 --> 03:39:20,620
You have to take them before the men in white come back.

5559
03:39:20,920 --> 03:39:21,620
Thank you for the super chat.

5560
03:39:21,700 --> 03:39:22,460
Thank you, thank you.

5561
03:39:22,580 --> 03:39:24,460
Mr. Brokenbon, thank you for the super chat.

5562
03:39:24,540 --> 03:39:25,420
Thank you, thank you.

5563
03:39:25,560 --> 03:39:27,360
Thank you for all your hard work done, Doki.

5564
03:39:27,520 --> 03:39:28,000
Thank you!

5565
03:39:28,080 --> 03:39:28,740
Thank you for the super chat.

5566
03:39:28,820 --> 03:39:29,620
Thank you, thank you.

5567
03:39:31,100 --> 03:39:31,380
Um...

5568
03:39:32,180 --> 03:39:33,200
TastyDiaz, thank you for the super chat.

5569
03:39:33,260 --> 03:39:33,960
Thank you, thank you.

5570
03:39:34,040 --> 03:39:38,800
Hey Doki, big ass boy, will you release your keycaps set in an alternative dark mode?

5571
03:39:38,900 --> 03:39:39,500
Thank you for the super chat.

5572
03:39:39,600 --> 03:39:40,060
Thank you, thank you.

5573
03:39:40,120 --> 03:39:42,400
If you buy all the stock, we can consider it.

5574
03:39:42,420 --> 03:39:44,700
It depends on, like, if there's...

5575
03:39:44,700 --> 03:39:46,140
Okay, not you individually.

5576
03:39:46,240 --> 03:39:49,720
I'm not asking you to spend all your money to buy the entire remaining stock of the merch.

5577
03:39:49,800 --> 03:39:51,700
By the way, they're talking about, um...

5578
03:39:51,700 --> 03:39:54,560
The Hyatt stuff is now in stock.

5579
03:39:54,620 --> 03:39:56,580
So those who haven't pre-ordered...

5580
03:39:56,580 --> 03:39:58,700
And were thinking about buying it, you can now...

5581
03:39:59,720 --> 03:40:00,160
Um...

5582
03:40:00,160 --> 03:40:01,520
Grab the collection.

5583
03:40:02,260 --> 03:40:02,700
Um...

5584
03:40:02,700 --> 03:40:05,820
But, like, really, it depends on if we'll have, like, more...

5585
03:40:06,520 --> 03:40:06,960
More...

5586
03:40:06,960 --> 03:40:08,860
If Hyatt and I work together more, it's mostly...

5587
03:40:09,580 --> 03:40:09,940
Um...

5588
03:40:09,940 --> 03:40:10,400
Okay, wait.

5589
03:40:11,880 --> 03:40:12,320
Um...

5590
03:40:12,320 --> 03:40:14,080
In stock now.

5591
03:40:14,700 --> 03:40:15,140
Uh...

5592
03:40:15,140 --> 03:40:19,700
For custom PC cases, keycaps, etc.

5593
03:40:21,680 --> 03:40:22,120
Um...

5594
03:40:22,120 --> 03:40:23,400
Maybe I'll put it up here, too.

5595
03:40:23,520 --> 03:40:23,980
Might as well.

5596
03:40:24,060 --> 03:40:24,880
It's shilling time.

5597
03:40:25,260 --> 03:40:27,440
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

5598
03:40:27,980 --> 03:40:28,320
Here.

5599
03:40:28,620 --> 03:40:29,140
Ha ha ha!

5600
03:40:29,720 --> 03:40:31,220
It's shilling time!

5601
03:40:33,420 --> 03:40:33,860
Um...

5602
03:40:33,860 --> 03:40:34,440
Uh...

5603
03:40:34,440 --> 03:40:36,340
Also, I miss just talking to you guys, you know?

5604
03:40:36,380 --> 03:40:38,460
I miss just being able to hang out and talk to you guys.

5605
03:40:38,780 --> 03:40:39,840
Thank you for the super chat!

5606
03:40:39,920 --> 03:40:40,760
Thank you, thank you!

5607
03:40:41,700 --> 03:40:42,140
Uh...

5608
03:40:42,140 --> 03:40:43,100
And, like...

5609
03:40:43,100 --> 03:40:45,040
We'd be able to make more...

5610
03:40:45,040 --> 03:40:48,080
Oh my gosh, maybe not there, because now you guys can't use the QR code.

5611
03:40:48,520 --> 03:40:48,820
Uh...

5612
03:40:48,820 --> 03:40:49,420
Make more...

5613
03:40:49,420 --> 03:40:51,960
Obviously, work together more if, uh, you know...

5614
03:40:51,960 --> 03:40:54,960
All the stock is sold out and, like, there's a demand for it.

5615
03:40:55,140 --> 03:40:55,940
So it's more of...

5616
03:40:55,940 --> 03:40:56,240
More...

5617
03:40:56,240 --> 03:40:57,420
But, like...

5618
03:40:57,420 --> 03:41:02,640
If there's a demand for it, then, obviously, we would work together more on stock.

5619
03:41:02,700 --> 03:41:03,380
Ha ha ha ha!

5620
03:41:04,600 --> 03:41:05,000
Um...

5621
03:41:05,000 --> 03:41:06,040
Alan, thank you for the super chat!

5622
03:41:06,120 --> 03:41:06,820
Thank you, thank you!

5623
03:41:07,060 --> 03:41:11,280
I'll be able to make another amazing concert in the future, as much as I want to go.

5624
03:41:11,280 --> 03:41:13,060
It's literally impossible for me to go this year.

5625
03:41:13,200 --> 03:41:15,200
I can't even throw money at this problem!

5626
03:41:15,540 --> 03:41:15,980
Good luck though!

5627
03:41:16,080 --> 03:41:16,720
Thank you for the super chat!

5628
03:41:16,820 --> 03:41:17,540
Thank you, thank you!

5629
03:41:17,760 --> 03:41:18,700
Yeah, I hope...

5630
03:41:18,700 --> 03:41:19,940
I hope so.

5631
03:41:20,100 --> 03:41:22,380
I hope I get another opportunity in the future.

5632
03:41:22,780 --> 03:41:25,860
I'm trying not to take things for granted right now.

5633
03:41:26,000 --> 03:41:26,800
And, like...

5634
03:41:26,800 --> 03:41:30,840
It's why I'm going, like, fast, fast, fast on all things.

5635
03:41:31,140 --> 03:41:32,680
I think, like...

5636
03:41:32,680 --> 03:41:36,440
I know I'm really lucky to be fortunate to be in the position I am in.

5637
03:41:36,740 --> 03:41:38,580
Like, I'll let you guys know this.

5638
03:41:38,580 --> 03:41:41,540
The amount of money I've made since coming back...

5639
03:41:41,540 --> 03:41:43,080
Has been...

5640
03:41:43,080 --> 03:41:46,140
More than what I've ever made before.

5641
03:41:48,640 --> 03:41:50,280
And much more.

5642
03:41:52,380 --> 03:41:53,420
So it's like...

5643
03:41:53,420 --> 03:41:54,400
And I don't even have merch.

5644
03:41:54,560 --> 03:41:55,160
That's the thing.

5645
03:41:55,220 --> 03:41:57,000
That's the craziest thing to me.

5646
03:41:57,300 --> 03:42:01,540
I don't even have, like, actual merch sales right now.

5647
03:42:01,700 --> 03:42:04,380
Because I'm, like, fixing all the stuff that's going on.

5648
03:42:08,780 --> 03:42:09,740
I, like...

5649
03:42:09,740 --> 03:42:12,700
I don't even have merch sales going on anymore.

5650
03:42:12,960 --> 03:42:14,600
Because, like, I'm trying to fix everything.

5651
03:42:20,640 --> 03:42:21,040
Well...

5652
03:42:21,040 --> 03:42:22,680
I'm not saying profit-wise.

5653
03:42:22,720 --> 03:42:23,740
Because I spent a lot, too.

5654
03:42:23,840 --> 03:42:25,040
I also spent a lot.

5655
03:42:25,240 --> 03:42:26,720
Because I'm making more.

5656
03:42:27,140 --> 03:42:29,420
I also spent a lot more.

5657
03:42:29,580 --> 03:42:30,740
And also, I moved and everything.

5658
03:42:31,080 --> 03:42:32,500
And also, I'm doing, like, dance lessons.

5659
03:42:32,580 --> 03:42:33,480
And also, that and that.

5660
03:42:33,620 --> 03:42:35,400
And there's, like, a lot of things going on as well.

5661
03:42:35,460 --> 03:42:36,160
So, like...

5662
03:42:36,160 --> 03:42:37,960
I don't know, like, profit-wise.

5663
03:42:37,960 --> 03:42:39,020
What it is.

5664
03:42:39,200 --> 03:42:40,420
Like, at the moment.

5665
03:42:41,080 --> 03:42:43,580
I don't know what the profit is at the moment.

5666
03:42:43,700 --> 03:42:45,640
Because, like, I haven't calculated anything.

5667
03:42:46,400 --> 03:42:46,840
Um...

5668
03:42:46,840 --> 03:42:47,900
So, like...

5669
03:42:47,900 --> 03:42:48,480
It's, like...

5670
03:42:48,480 --> 03:42:50,420
I'm trying not to take things for granted.

5671
03:42:50,620 --> 03:42:51,700
So, I'm trying to, like...

5672
03:42:51,700 --> 03:42:55,600
I know everything is happening super fast right now.

5673
03:42:55,840 --> 03:42:58,240
But, like, I don't know if I'll have another...

5674
03:42:58,240 --> 03:42:58,860
Like...

5675
03:42:58,860 --> 03:43:00,280
If this year...

5676
03:43:00,280 --> 03:43:02,260
After this year...

5677
03:43:03,620 --> 03:43:04,060
Um...

5678
03:43:04,060 --> 03:43:04,960
It's gonna be...

5679
03:43:05,560 --> 03:43:07,240
Like, it would be the same.

5680
03:43:08,220 --> 03:43:08,600
Like...

5681
03:43:11,460 --> 03:43:14,900
So, that's also why I'm, like...

5682
03:43:14,900 --> 03:43:17,380
Saying yes to a lot of opportunities.

5683
03:43:18,940 --> 03:43:19,320
And...

5684
03:43:19,780 --> 03:43:20,160
Um...

5685
03:43:20,160 --> 03:43:21,440
Yeah, I'm also, like...

5686
03:43:21,440 --> 03:43:22,820
I have to think about taxes, too.

5687
03:43:23,180 --> 03:43:25,280
But I'm also saying yes to a lot of opportunities.

5688
03:43:25,560 --> 03:43:27,200
Saying yes to a lot of, like...

5689
03:43:27,200 --> 03:43:28,800
Things that are being offered to me.

5690
03:43:28,900 --> 03:43:30,180
Like, this Minecraft thing.

5691
03:43:30,500 --> 03:43:32,480
I thought, like, it'd be nice to meet new people.

5692
03:43:32,540 --> 03:43:34,480
Even though I'm, like, super anxious and everything.

5693
03:43:36,280 --> 03:43:36,660
Um...

5694
03:43:36,660 --> 03:43:38,020
And, like...

5695
03:43:38,020 --> 03:43:38,360
Uh...

5696
03:43:38,360 --> 03:43:40,400
Try my best to...

5697
03:43:40,400 --> 03:43:42,940
Talk to people, which is very hard.

5698
03:43:45,760 --> 03:43:46,320
And...

5699
03:43:46,320 --> 03:43:47,220
Uh...

5700
03:43:47,220 --> 03:43:50,000
And just, like, try my best to be...

5701
03:43:50,000 --> 03:43:51,100
To, like...

5702
03:43:51,660 --> 03:43:52,160
Uh...

5703
03:43:52,160 --> 03:43:53,560
You know...

5704
03:43:53,560 --> 03:43:55,640
Meet new people and stuff.

5705
03:43:55,920 --> 03:43:57,680
And do new opportunities.

5706
03:43:57,900 --> 03:43:59,540
Do things I haven't done before.

5707
03:44:00,420 --> 03:44:00,980
Um...

5708
03:44:00,980 --> 03:44:02,120
And do a lot of conventions.

5709
03:44:02,260 --> 03:44:04,800
Because I never had a chance to do a lot of conventions, too.

5710
03:44:05,980 --> 03:44:06,500
So...

5711
03:44:06,500 --> 03:44:06,940
Um...

5712
03:44:06,940 --> 03:44:07,800
It's, like...

5713
03:44:08,380 --> 03:44:09,060
It's, like...

5714
03:44:09,060 --> 03:44:10,560
I- That's why I'm going...

5715
03:44:10,560 --> 03:44:12,740
I feel like you guys are, like...

5716
03:44:12,740 --> 03:44:14,220
When will she stop...

5717
03:44:14,220 --> 03:44:16,700
When will she stop getting these Ws?

5718
03:44:16,740 --> 03:44:18,140
And then I'm just, like...

5719
03:44:18,140 --> 03:44:19,220
I'm just, like...

5720
03:44:19,220 --> 03:44:21,320
There's a lot of stuff coming in.

5721
03:44:25,580 --> 03:44:26,820
I'm just, like...

5722
03:44:26,820 --> 03:44:27,420
I know...

5723
03:44:27,420 --> 03:44:29,100
Dragoons are not used to this.

5724
03:44:29,480 --> 03:44:30,680
Dragoons are, like...

5725
03:44:30,680 --> 03:44:32,980
Not used to having so many, like...

5726
03:44:34,140 --> 03:44:34,660
Announcements.

5727
03:44:34,660 --> 03:44:38,260
Back to back to back to back.

5728
03:44:38,620 --> 03:44:39,020
And...

5729
03:44:41,700 --> 03:44:42,980
It's, like...

5730
03:44:42,980 --> 03:44:43,860
It's, like...

5731
03:44:43,860 --> 03:44:45,800
It feels like every week...

5732
03:44:46,240 --> 03:44:48,060
Like, there's something...

5733
03:44:49,060 --> 03:44:50,900
Every week, there's, like...

5734
03:44:50,900 --> 03:44:52,560
Something new happening.

5735
03:44:54,520 --> 03:44:56,420
And I hope you guys...

5736
03:44:56,420 --> 03:44:58,040
I really hope you guys...

5737
03:44:59,060 --> 03:45:01,340
Aren't overdosing on it.

5738
03:45:05,720 --> 03:45:06,940
I like the way you laugh.

5739
03:45:07,040 --> 03:45:07,660
Thank you!

5740
03:45:08,240 --> 03:45:09,120
I'm glad.

5741
03:45:11,660 --> 03:45:12,680
But yeah.

5742
03:45:13,420 --> 03:45:17,460
I just want you guys to be able to enjoy the moment.

5743
03:45:17,780 --> 03:45:18,700
Especially, like...

5744
03:45:21,760 --> 03:45:24,560
You know, everything you guys have all been through.

5745
03:45:25,180 --> 03:45:26,780
And you guys have...

5746
03:45:26,780 --> 03:45:28,540
Still here after everything.

5747
03:45:28,780 --> 03:45:29,920
Which is...

5748
03:45:30,560 --> 03:45:32,300
Which really means a lot.

5749
03:45:32,400 --> 03:45:33,420
It was, like, my biggest worry.

5750
03:45:33,420 --> 03:45:34,400
I was just, like...

5751
03:45:34,400 --> 03:45:37,400
After coming back as Indie, I was just, like...

5752
03:45:37,400 --> 03:45:38,900
Oh my god, like...

5753
03:45:38,900 --> 03:45:39,920
It was just, like...

5754
03:45:39,920 --> 03:45:40,740
What do I do?

5755
03:45:41,980 --> 03:45:42,380
Like...

5756
03:45:42,380 --> 03:45:44,060
Can I still do this?

5757
03:45:45,880 --> 03:45:46,680
I'm just, like...

5758
03:45:46,680 --> 03:45:47,560
Oh my god.

5759
03:45:47,600 --> 03:45:48,660
Can I still do this?

5760
03:45:48,780 --> 03:45:50,520
Like, what's gonna be...

5761
03:45:50,520 --> 03:45:52,200
Will I even be able to, like...

5762
03:45:52,200 --> 03:45:53,260
Do anything?

5763
03:45:53,340 --> 03:45:54,540
Am I, like, blacklisted?

5764
03:46:05,950 --> 03:46:06,470
So...

5765
03:46:06,470 --> 03:46:08,090
I really do...

5766
03:46:08,090 --> 03:46:09,470
Appreciate it, guys.

5767
03:46:10,950 --> 03:46:15,050
Also, speaking of, like...

5768
03:46:15,050 --> 03:46:15,990
VTuber stuff.

5769
03:46:16,490 --> 03:46:20,010
I heard the VTuber award nominations are out now.

5770
03:46:20,410 --> 03:46:20,790
I really...

5771
03:46:21,850 --> 03:46:22,810
Like, appreciate...

5772
03:46:22,810 --> 03:46:25,050
I think this is, like, the one thing I would really like.

5773
03:46:25,270 --> 03:46:25,670
I think I...

5774
03:46:25,670 --> 03:46:27,030
Did I write that in my goals list?

5775
03:46:28,630 --> 03:46:29,150
But...

5776
03:46:29,750 --> 03:46:30,910
Chilling Time Part 2.

5777
03:46:30,910 --> 03:46:31,170
So...

5778
03:46:34,570 --> 03:46:36,730
Nominations are now up.

5779
03:46:37,210 --> 03:46:39,910
I would love to be nominated...

5780
03:46:40,430 --> 03:46:43,770
For FPS and Gamer of the Year.

5781
03:46:44,070 --> 03:46:47,510
Alright, so the VTuber awards are back.

5782
03:46:48,150 --> 03:46:49,090
And, like...

5783
03:46:49,090 --> 03:46:50,330
Honestly...

5784
03:46:50,550 --> 03:46:52,110
I don't really...

5785
03:46:52,110 --> 03:46:52,650
Ask...

5786
03:46:52,650 --> 03:46:54,030
I don't feel like I ask for things.

5787
03:46:58,010 --> 03:46:59,150
But, like...

5788
03:46:59,530 --> 03:47:00,510
Low-key...

5789
03:47:00,510 --> 03:47:03,470
I would really like to be nominated...

5790
03:47:03,470 --> 03:47:06,610
As FPS and Gamer of the Year.

5791
03:47:07,450 --> 03:47:08,510
Just cause, like...

5792
03:47:09,750 --> 03:47:10,610
It's sort of, like...

5793
03:47:11,810 --> 03:47:13,510
I just want my...

5794
03:47:13,510 --> 03:47:14,550
Me on there.

5795
03:47:16,690 --> 03:47:18,670
I'm trying to, like, word this...

5796
03:47:18,670 --> 03:47:19,750
Properly, you know?

5797
03:47:19,850 --> 03:47:21,670
Cause if you look at 2023...

5798
03:47:21,670 --> 03:47:22,510
I'm, like...

5799
03:47:24,970 --> 03:47:25,410
But...

5800
03:47:26,490 --> 03:47:28,070
So, I'm just, like...

5801
03:47:28,070 --> 03:47:29,890
I just want, like...

5802
03:47:29,890 --> 03:47:31,230
2024, like...

5803
03:47:31,890 --> 03:47:32,390
Joke-keeper.

5804
03:47:35,810 --> 03:47:37,010
It's really...

5805
03:47:37,010 --> 03:47:39,070
I just want that to...

5806
03:47:40,030 --> 03:47:41,510
Not your replace.

5807
03:47:41,850 --> 03:47:43,330
That's a better...

5808
03:47:44,030 --> 03:47:45,250
That's a better word.

5809
03:47:45,570 --> 03:47:47,470
I want that to replace.

5810
03:47:48,810 --> 03:47:49,810
So, it's like...

5811
03:47:49,810 --> 03:47:51,270
It's sort of, like, the last...

5812
03:47:51,850 --> 03:47:53,010
I guess, like...

5813
03:47:53,730 --> 03:47:54,330
Part...

5814
03:47:54,970 --> 03:47:55,570
Of...

5815
03:47:55,570 --> 03:47:57,530
History that I want, like, a good...

5816
03:47:58,070 --> 03:47:59,710
A good memory of.

5817
03:48:00,130 --> 03:48:01,530
I mean, it's still a good memory.

5818
03:48:02,110 --> 03:48:04,430
It just sucks when I look at 2023 winners.

5819
03:48:08,930 --> 03:48:09,810
It's just...

5820
03:48:09,810 --> 03:48:11,190
Like, okay, to be true...

5821
03:48:11,190 --> 03:48:11,730
It still...

5822
03:48:11,730 --> 03:48:12,550
It does suck.

5823
03:48:12,750 --> 03:48:15,370
Like, when I see 2023 winners...

5824
03:48:15,370 --> 03:48:15,790
And I see...

5825
03:48:15,790 --> 03:48:16,150
I was, like...

5826
03:48:16,150 --> 03:48:19,450
I just want, like, in 2024...

5827
03:48:19,450 --> 03:48:20,570
Just, like, you know...

5828
03:48:20,570 --> 03:48:23,070
My joke-keeper on there instead.

5829
03:48:23,990 --> 03:48:24,350
Like...

5830
03:48:26,830 --> 03:48:29,390
Especially my fucking acceptance speech.

5831
03:48:29,510 --> 03:48:29,790
I...

5832
03:48:29,790 --> 03:48:31,070
I take it back.

5833
03:48:42,780 --> 03:48:43,780
Let's see.

5834
03:48:44,720 --> 03:48:46,700
Riz, thank you for the super chat.

5835
03:48:46,780 --> 03:48:47,900
Thank you, thank you.

5836
03:48:49,580 --> 03:48:51,820
I don't care what these people say.

5837
03:48:53,720 --> 03:48:55,780
Yusan, Doxan, Sanastro, I can say you sing.

5838
03:48:55,780 --> 03:48:56,640
You can sing!

5839
03:48:56,820 --> 03:48:58,660
Toki, thank you for the super chat.

5840
03:48:59,600 --> 03:49:00,980
Thank you, thank you.

5841
03:49:03,680 --> 03:49:04,580
That's why I was, like...

5842
03:49:04,580 --> 03:49:05,600
I really want to be nominated.

5843
03:49:05,880 --> 03:49:06,680
Because I want, like...

5844
03:49:06,680 --> 03:49:07,960
Happier memories.

5845
03:49:08,400 --> 03:49:10,900
I want happier memories of it.

5846
03:49:11,140 --> 03:49:12,900
To overwrite it.

5847
03:49:14,220 --> 03:49:16,140
That's why I really want to be nominated.

5848
03:49:18,140 --> 03:49:19,400
No, I do ask for a lot.

5849
03:49:20,040 --> 03:49:21,720
I'll be like, subscribe to me!

5850
03:49:21,940 --> 03:49:22,740
Buy my...

5851
03:49:22,740 --> 03:49:24,160
JK, I do ask for a lot.

5852
03:49:24,440 --> 03:49:26,200
But I'll ask for a little bit more.

5853
03:49:29,840 --> 03:49:31,060
Nexi, thank you for the super chat.

5854
03:49:31,140 --> 03:49:31,860
Thank you, thank you.

5855
03:49:32,080 --> 03:49:34,020
I hope you never stop getting those Ws.

5856
03:49:34,040 --> 03:49:34,840
It's so exciting.

5857
03:49:34,960 --> 03:49:35,620
Thank you for the super chat.

5858
03:49:35,680 --> 03:49:36,100
Thank you, thank you.

5859
03:49:36,300 --> 03:49:38,400
Oh, did I show you guys the snapshot for the...

5860
03:49:40,600 --> 03:49:43,680
I did, but I'll show you guys the final design we went with.

5861
03:49:43,860 --> 03:49:45,880
For the Lunar New Year snapshots.

5862
03:49:46,900 --> 03:49:49,380
I'm so excited for next year.

5863
03:49:49,380 --> 03:49:51,200
When we can actually do merch.

5864
03:49:51,360 --> 03:49:53,780
Because merch design is something...

5865
03:49:53,780 --> 03:49:58,920
I have an entire folder of stuff I want to do for merch.

5866
03:49:59,100 --> 03:49:59,710
And it's like...

5867
03:50:00,180 --> 03:50:01,460
I just want to...

5868
03:50:01,460 --> 03:50:02,200
I just...

5869
03:50:02,200 --> 03:50:06,660
I just cannot wait until all of that fucking shit is fixed.

5870
03:50:09,580 --> 03:50:10,840
It's like...

5871
03:50:10,840 --> 03:50:12,320
We're so close.

5872
03:50:12,820 --> 03:50:15,020
It's practically fixed now.

5873
03:50:15,180 --> 03:50:18,720
But we're doing a trial run with our new distributor.

5874
03:50:19,460 --> 03:50:22,720
And it should be shipped by...

5875
03:50:24,400 --> 03:50:25,980
The stuff that...

5876
03:50:25,980 --> 03:50:30,320
Well, the old distributor is shipping the remaining products from the old merch.

5877
03:50:30,740 --> 03:50:31,920
But the new merch that...

5878
03:50:32,280 --> 03:50:33,680
Like the acrylic stand.

5879
03:50:33,880 --> 03:50:36,740
The Bounty Hunter acrylic stand is being done by our new distributor.

5880
03:50:37,280 --> 03:50:38,760
That's gonna be finished.

5881
03:50:39,040 --> 03:50:40,820
That should be shipped by December.

5882
03:50:41,540 --> 03:50:43,580
For the new Bounty Hunter acrylic stand.

5883
03:50:43,700 --> 03:50:45,620
By the way, we upgraded the acrylic stand.

5884
03:50:45,920 --> 03:50:47,020
Because you guys waited so much.

5885
03:50:47,060 --> 03:50:47,520
So long.

5886
03:50:47,520 --> 03:50:49,940
So I asked them to upgrade the whole entire thing.

5887
03:50:50,020 --> 03:50:53,720
So it's gonna be like a diorama acrylic stand now.

5888
03:50:54,060 --> 03:50:55,440
So just so you guys know.

5889
03:50:55,640 --> 03:50:57,900
So it's like super upgraded and stuff.

5890
03:50:58,560 --> 03:51:00,840
Just because you guys waited so long for it.

5891
03:51:00,880 --> 03:51:03,940
And I asked for like an upgrade to make it like...

5892
03:51:04,500 --> 03:51:04,900
Better.

5893
03:51:05,460 --> 03:51:07,500
Just for those who waited for so long.

5894
03:51:07,780 --> 03:51:08,020
Anyway.

5895
03:51:09,720 --> 03:51:10,680
Anyway, here is...

5896
03:51:11,080 --> 03:51:12,420
Also, it's so nice to just talk to you guys.

5897
03:51:12,440 --> 03:51:13,540
I haven't done that in a long time.

5898
03:51:13,920 --> 03:51:15,680
But I don't have to fucking go to dance lessons.

5899
03:51:15,760 --> 03:51:17,060
It sucks that I can't go to dance lessons.

5900
03:51:17,060 --> 03:51:18,120
But like...

5901
03:51:18,120 --> 03:51:19,320
At least I can actually...

5902
03:51:19,320 --> 03:51:20,020
Zazz it on.

5903
03:51:22,340 --> 03:51:22,820
Anyway.

5904
03:51:23,360 --> 03:51:25,500
So this is the front of it.

5905
03:51:25,600 --> 03:51:26,900
By the way, please don't...

5906
03:51:26,900 --> 03:51:28,300
Please don't illegally download this.

5907
03:51:30,460 --> 03:51:30,940
Like...

5908
03:51:32,440 --> 03:51:33,860
Don't illegally download...

5909
03:51:33,860 --> 03:51:36,080
You won't illegally download this, right?

5910
03:51:37,680 --> 03:51:38,160
Anyway.

5911
03:51:38,320 --> 03:51:39,980
And then this is the...

5912
03:51:39,980 --> 03:51:40,520
Oh shit.

5913
03:51:40,640 --> 03:51:40,860
Okay.

5914
03:51:41,380 --> 03:51:43,880
This is the back side of the snapshot.

5915
03:51:44,060 --> 03:51:45,480
So this is a regular bundle.

5916
03:51:46,460 --> 03:51:48,980
So this is the snapshot of...

5917
03:51:48,980 --> 03:51:49,540
You know, like...

5918
03:51:49,540 --> 03:51:51,500
You put it in like a snapshot sleeve.

5919
03:51:51,720 --> 03:51:52,900
And then this is what...

5920
03:51:52,900 --> 03:51:54,060
This is what it looks like.

5921
03:51:54,120 --> 03:51:55,360
I thought it was really cute.

5922
03:51:55,440 --> 03:51:56,300
How it...

5923
03:51:56,300 --> 03:51:58,060
How it's design and everything.

5924
03:51:58,360 --> 03:51:59,080
I think it's...

5925
03:51:59,080 --> 03:51:59,340
Alright.

5926
03:51:59,440 --> 03:52:00,980
Now you guys are making me paranoid.

5927
03:52:01,060 --> 03:52:01,840
I'm making it smaller.

5928
03:52:02,280 --> 03:52:09,140
I'm making it smaller now.

5929
03:52:09,240 --> 03:52:10,980
Now you're making me paranoid.

5930
03:52:15,880 --> 03:52:17,500
This is the...

5931
03:52:17,500 --> 03:52:19,060
I'm making it even smaller now.

5932
03:52:19,400 --> 03:52:21,980
The back side and the front side of the...

5933
03:52:21,980 --> 03:52:23,100
The photo.

5934
03:52:23,220 --> 03:52:25,020
I guess you can call it the photo card.

5935
03:52:26,080 --> 03:52:26,660
Okay.

5936
03:52:26,840 --> 03:52:27,640
The fucking quality.

5937
03:52:27,760 --> 03:52:28,520
Okay, now...

5938
03:52:28,520 --> 03:52:30,520
We can't have nice things anymore.

5939
03:52:34,180 --> 03:52:35,160
But it's...

5940
03:52:35,160 --> 03:52:35,980
It's too late.

5941
03:52:36,240 --> 03:52:36,580
Please.

5942
03:52:37,040 --> 03:52:37,860
Please don't...

5943
03:52:37,860 --> 03:52:38,920
Don't steal it.

5944
03:52:39,020 --> 03:52:39,400
Please.

5945
03:52:44,020 --> 03:52:44,560
But...

5946
03:52:44,560 --> 03:52:45,820
But it's really cute.

5947
03:52:45,940 --> 03:52:47,560
And I'm super happy about it.

5948
03:52:47,660 --> 03:52:48,520
I'm just like...

5949
03:52:48,520 --> 03:52:50,240
There's so many things going on.

5950
03:52:50,280 --> 03:52:51,040
I'm so happy.

5951
03:52:54,280 --> 03:52:55,160
But yeah.

5952
03:52:55,580 --> 03:52:56,120
There's...

5953
03:52:56,120 --> 03:52:57,060
For those who don't know.

5954
03:52:57,200 --> 03:52:58,380
Also like...

5955
03:52:58,380 --> 03:52:59,120
Doobie is going...

5956
03:52:59,120 --> 03:53:00,100
Coming to my...

5957
03:53:00,100 --> 03:53:02,440
Coming to our 3D concert.

5958
03:53:02,900 --> 03:53:03,400
Doobie.

5959
03:53:04,140 --> 03:53:06,080
Doobie is such a fucking funny name.

5960
03:53:06,520 --> 03:53:07,540
Like I'm gonna doob.

5961
03:53:08,500 --> 03:53:09,380
I'm doobing.

5962
03:53:09,380 --> 03:53:10,160
I'm doobing.

5963
03:53:17,140 --> 03:53:18,800
Tomorrow is my birthday.

5964
03:53:18,920 --> 03:53:19,620
So here's $20.

5965
03:53:20,100 --> 03:53:21,360
Oli, thank you for the super chat.

5966
03:53:21,420 --> 03:53:21,680
Thank you.

5967
03:53:21,700 --> 03:53:22,200
Thank you.

5968
03:53:22,280 --> 03:53:23,880
Happy birthday to you.

5969
03:53:24,040 --> 03:53:25,780
Happy birthday to you.

5970
03:53:26,080 --> 03:53:27,860
Happy birthday, dear Oli.

5971
03:53:28,260 --> 03:53:30,020
Happy birthday to you.

5972
03:53:30,140 --> 03:53:30,560
Yeah.

5973
03:53:32,300 --> 03:53:33,220
Thank you.

5974
03:53:33,660 --> 03:53:34,380
Thank you.

5975
03:53:34,560 --> 03:53:35,100
I really...

5976
03:53:35,100 --> 03:53:36,720
I really appreciate it.

5977
03:53:37,060 --> 03:53:38,180
It's your birthday.

5978
03:53:38,180 --> 03:53:40,060
And you're paying me money.

5979
03:53:42,080 --> 03:53:42,720
Let's see.

5980
03:53:42,900 --> 03:53:44,240
John Lacone, thank you for the super chat.

5981
03:53:44,420 --> 03:53:44,460
Thank you.

5982
03:53:44,600 --> 03:53:46,640
You better believe we'd be in it for the long haul.

5983
03:53:46,740 --> 03:53:47,260
Trust in us.

5984
03:53:47,280 --> 03:53:47,920
We trust in you.

5985
03:53:47,980 --> 03:53:48,840
Thank you for the super chat.

5986
03:53:48,900 --> 03:53:49,140
Thank you.

5987
03:53:49,200 --> 03:53:49,600
Thank you.

5988
03:53:49,660 --> 03:53:51,380
Gio, so glad you have a lot of opportunities now.

5989
03:53:51,440 --> 03:53:52,340
And you're having fun too.

5990
03:53:52,480 --> 03:53:53,460
We're going up and out.

5991
03:53:53,580 --> 03:53:54,200
Thank you for the super chat.

5992
03:53:54,300 --> 03:53:54,540
Thank you.

5993
03:53:54,620 --> 03:53:55,100
Thank you.

5994
03:53:55,480 --> 03:53:55,800
AK.

5995
03:53:56,620 --> 03:53:57,780
Dragoons are ride or die.

5996
03:53:57,900 --> 03:53:58,560
Doki Bird 2.

5997
03:53:58,720 --> 03:53:59,640
Moon and beyond.

5998
03:53:59,940 --> 03:54:00,720
Thank you for the super chat.

5999
03:54:00,820 --> 03:54:01,020
Thank you.

6000
03:54:01,100 --> 03:54:01,320
Thank you.

6001
03:54:01,340 --> 03:54:03,480
Oh, did I show you one of the merch I'm making?

6002
03:54:04,620 --> 03:54:05,820
I'm gonna spoil it.

6003
03:54:06,300 --> 03:54:07,520
I have like a lot of...

6004
03:54:07,520 --> 03:54:07,920
Oh, shit.

6005
03:54:07,980 --> 03:54:08,880
This is not the person.

6006
03:54:09,120 --> 03:54:09,540
Oh, my God.

6007
03:54:09,620 --> 03:54:10,680
I typed in a different...

6008
03:54:10,680 --> 03:54:12,660
That was not the person I wanted to...

6009
03:54:12,660 --> 03:54:14,120
Wait, what's this person's name?

6010
03:54:15,860 --> 03:54:16,300
Uh...

6011
03:54:16,300 --> 03:54:17,180
Oh, fuck.

6012
03:54:17,260 --> 03:54:18,560
What is this person's name?

6013
03:54:19,140 --> 03:54:20,980
I want to show you guys.

6014
03:54:21,340 --> 03:54:23,340
Did I show you guys the coin I'm making?

6015
03:54:23,840 --> 03:54:24,660
I did, right?

6016
03:54:24,700 --> 03:54:25,780
No, I did.

6017
03:54:25,960 --> 03:54:27,000
I showed you guys.

6018
03:54:27,100 --> 03:54:28,200
It's not even a spoiler.

6019
03:54:28,900 --> 03:54:31,240
I already showed you guys the coin.

6020
03:54:32,760 --> 03:54:33,960
I remember now.

6021
03:54:34,020 --> 03:54:35,840
I showed you guys what it looks like.

6022
03:54:37,060 --> 03:54:37,500
Yeah.

6023
03:54:37,500 --> 03:54:39,340
Yeah, the Doki coin.

6024
03:54:39,620 --> 03:54:40,800
Didn't I show you guys?

6025
03:54:42,020 --> 03:54:43,580
Did I show you guys what it's gonna look like?

6026
03:54:45,760 --> 03:54:48,020
Did I show you guys what it's gonna look like, though?

6027
03:54:48,380 --> 03:54:49,440
I don't remember.

6028
03:54:50,960 --> 03:54:51,680
I did?

6029
03:54:51,920 --> 03:54:53,180
Okay, I'll show you guys another...

6030
03:54:53,180 --> 03:54:55,760
I'll show you guys a more refined version.

6031
03:54:56,400 --> 03:54:59,340
You guys can't steal this one because like, uh...

6032
03:54:59,840 --> 03:55:00,700
It's unstealable.

6033
03:55:01,600 --> 03:55:03,240
Okay, so it's this.

6034
03:55:04,640 --> 03:55:06,220
Uh, no, it's not fucking crypto.

6035
03:55:09,780 --> 03:55:11,660
This is the front of the coin.

6036
03:55:13,320 --> 03:55:15,800
I think crypto's dead now, isn't it?

6037
03:55:17,000 --> 03:55:19,740
And this is the... this is the back of it.

6038
03:55:19,820 --> 03:55:21,840
I won't be surprised if someone makes a V2 rare crypto coin.

6039
03:55:21,980 --> 03:55:23,180
I would not be surprised.

6040
03:55:23,660 --> 03:55:24,440
Uh, but yeah!

6041
03:55:25,200 --> 03:55:30,100
Uh, this is the... this is the Doki coin that I'm working on, too.

6042
03:55:30,980 --> 03:55:34,760
Um, obviously we're fixing our merch issue before we fucking do all of this.

6043
03:55:36,720 --> 03:55:37,200
Hahahahaha!

6044
03:55:40,620 --> 03:55:41,980
Um, but yeah!

6045
03:55:42,080 --> 03:55:45,260
This is the Doki coin that I'm, uh...

6046
03:55:45,820 --> 03:55:48,040
Um, it's like those, like, actual coins.

6047
03:55:48,200 --> 03:55:49,880
Like, those, like, um...

6048
03:55:49,880 --> 03:55:51,580
With, like, the textures and stuff.

6049
03:55:52,040 --> 03:55:54,900
So, I'm, like, I don't know how to explain it.

6050
03:55:54,920 --> 03:55:56,280
Like, those medallion coins.

6051
03:55:57,300 --> 03:56:01,160
Uh, like, you see sometimes the little indent texture.

6052
03:56:01,160 --> 03:56:04,960
Like, the dark gold is, like, a special texture and stuff.

6053
03:56:05,160 --> 03:56:05,920
Yeah, yeah.

6054
03:56:06,080 --> 03:56:07,820
So, that's basically...

6055
03:56:07,820 --> 03:56:13,360
I think I asked for corrections on this a little bit, but I don't remember.

6056
03:56:14,160 --> 03:56:15,120
I don't remember.

6057
03:56:15,240 --> 03:56:16,710
I'll figure it out later, but...

6058
03:56:17,620 --> 03:56:18,080
Hahahahaha!

6059
03:56:18,700 --> 03:56:20,200
Um, but yeah, I'm super excited.

6060
03:56:20,420 --> 03:56:22,560
There's, like, so many plans for things.

6061
03:56:22,640 --> 03:56:24,320
And I'm, like, yay!

6062
03:56:25,280 --> 03:56:28,640
I just hope everything goes okay.

6063
03:56:28,640 --> 03:56:32,740
And, like, I hope, like, next year will...

6064
03:56:32,740 --> 03:56:35,180
Might not be, like, as...

6065
03:56:35,180 --> 03:56:37,720
It might not have, like, as many opportunities as this year.

6066
03:56:37,840 --> 03:56:40,760
But, like, I hope that next year will be okay.

6067
03:56:41,480 --> 03:56:44,680
I hope next year Doki will...

6068
03:56:44,680 --> 03:56:47,620
Will, like, still be okay.

6069
03:56:47,760 --> 03:56:50,000
And can still do the things she wants to do.

6070
03:56:51,160 --> 03:56:51,680
Hahahahaha!

6071
03:56:53,060 --> 03:56:53,500
Hahahahaha!

6072
03:56:54,740 --> 03:56:57,360
Oh yeah, I'm releasing new anima...

6073
03:56:57,360 --> 03:56:59,760
I'm releasing free animated stickers today.

6074
03:57:00,020 --> 03:57:04,180
So, I'll post that on Twitter, on the YouTube community post about that.

6075
03:57:04,580 --> 03:57:06,980
Uh, so, uh, for those who were...

6076
03:57:06,980 --> 03:57:08,420
Wanted to...

6077
03:57:08,420 --> 03:57:11,400
Uh, for those who aren't able to afford the line stickers.

6078
03:57:11,560 --> 03:57:14,120
Also, I was so surprised at the amount of people that bought it.

6079
03:57:14,380 --> 03:57:15,700
Like, I know, I...

6080
03:57:15,700 --> 03:57:17,720
I thought, I was not...

6081
03:57:17,720 --> 03:57:21,640
I made it not thinking that I was not going to make a profit off of it.

6082
03:57:21,700 --> 03:57:23,640
I just thought it would be really cute for you guys.

6083
03:57:23,820 --> 03:57:24,780
For you guys to use.

6084
03:57:25,140 --> 03:57:26,380
That's a lot of my ideas.

6085
03:57:26,660 --> 03:57:28,440
It's more so of, like...

6086
03:57:28,440 --> 03:57:29,900
I just think the idea...

6087
03:57:29,900 --> 03:57:31,220
Like, I just like doing them.

6088
03:57:31,260 --> 03:57:32,920
Just because I think it will be...

6089
03:57:32,920 --> 03:57:34,420
You guys will enjoy it.

6090
03:57:34,500 --> 03:57:35,900
And I don't go in for profit.

6091
03:57:36,080 --> 03:57:38,500
I just think, like, oh, you guys are going to enjoy it.

6092
03:57:38,540 --> 03:57:40,240
So, like, uh, like...

6093
03:57:40,240 --> 03:57:43,700
Um, I don't really think about, like, profit wise when I do these types of things.

6094
03:57:43,920 --> 03:57:47,180
So, I was really surprised that we're almost...

6095
03:57:47,180 --> 03:57:48,940
Because, like, it's an animated sticker.

6096
03:57:49,180 --> 03:57:50,320
So, it was, like, really expensive.

6097
03:57:50,640 --> 03:57:52,280
Just because, like, there's, like, 16 of it.

6098
03:57:52,700 --> 03:57:53,900
There's 16 of it.

6099
03:57:53,980 --> 03:57:55,940
And it was, like, you know, um...

6100
03:57:55,940 --> 03:57:57,500
Hubion is, like, an amazing artist.

6101
03:57:57,860 --> 03:58:01,320
And, um, they worked really hard on, like, creating all of it.

6102
03:58:01,540 --> 03:58:05,620
So, like, honestly, I went in thinking it would be, like, in the red when it comes to, like...

6103
03:58:05,620 --> 03:58:07,100
Will I make back the money?

6104
03:58:08,700 --> 03:58:09,140
Um...

6105
03:58:09,600 --> 03:58:12,340
And we actually almost broke even.

6106
03:58:12,780 --> 03:58:15,780
Which I was very surprised about.

6107
03:58:15,780 --> 03:58:21,640
I was not expecting us to, like, almost break even on it.

6108
03:58:23,320 --> 03:58:24,000
So...

6109
03:58:25,900 --> 03:58:27,940
That's a nice surprise.

6110
03:58:28,420 --> 03:58:29,280
That's a...

6111
03:58:29,280 --> 03:58:32,780
It's just, you know, it's nice when things work out.

6112
03:58:37,220 --> 03:58:38,700
Marco, thank you for the superchat.

6113
03:58:38,780 --> 03:58:39,380
Thank you, thank you.

6114
03:58:39,380 --> 03:58:44,520
I only started watching you and other VTubers in general around February, but I'm proud to call you my Kamiyoshi now.

6115
03:58:44,540 --> 03:58:45,540
Oh, thank you, Marco!

6116
03:58:46,480 --> 03:58:47,600
Keep on being you, Doki.

6117
03:58:47,700 --> 03:58:48,220
Thank you.

6118
03:58:48,260 --> 03:58:49,220
Thank you for the superchat.

6119
03:58:49,320 --> 03:58:50,460
Thank you, thank you.

6120
03:58:51,280 --> 03:58:52,580
Solid, thank you for the superchat.

6121
03:58:52,680 --> 03:58:53,420
Thank you, thank you.

6122
03:58:53,500 --> 03:58:55,440
One day I'll be able to get some of that cute Doki merch.

6123
03:58:55,520 --> 03:58:58,140
Marco Edwards, until then, damn you, Latin America curse.

6124
03:58:58,240 --> 03:58:59,000
Keep being awesome.

6125
03:58:59,360 --> 03:59:00,000
Thank you for the superchat.

6126
03:59:00,120 --> 03:59:00,920
Thank you, thank you.

6127
03:59:01,160 --> 03:59:04,320
My financially responsible Oshii is in the black!

6128
03:59:04,760 --> 03:59:05,100
Yippee!

6129
03:59:06,420 --> 03:59:08,120
Thank you for the superchat, Johnny.

6130
03:59:08,180 --> 03:59:08,900
Thank you, thank you.

6131
03:59:08,900 --> 03:59:10,320
Anyway, I'm gonna call it here.

6132
03:59:10,540 --> 03:59:12,460
I have a member stream in two hours.

6133
03:59:13,340 --> 03:59:14,500
I don't remember what time I set up.

6134
03:59:14,840 --> 03:59:17,180
I have a member stream and then I have Kami Furou today.

6135
03:59:17,580 --> 03:59:19,300
So, uh...

6136
03:59:19,300 --> 03:59:21,720
I was supposed to rest my voice, but I ended up fucking...

6137
03:59:21,720 --> 03:59:24,960
I don't know, I haven't had a chance to talk to you guys in a long time, so I was just like...

6138
03:59:24,960 --> 03:59:25,860
I just kept yapping.

6139
03:59:27,840 --> 03:59:30,120
I had so much energy because I drank GamerSup today.

6140
03:59:30,360 --> 03:59:32,020
Anyway, you guys didn't know, I have a GamerSup code.

6141
03:59:32,120 --> 03:59:34,040
It's DokiBird and you can get 10% off.

6142
03:59:35,020 --> 03:59:38,140
I don't know when the GamerSup stuff is gonna be out.

6143
03:59:38,140 --> 03:59:39,900
We were talking about...

6144
03:59:39,900 --> 03:59:43,820
I was talking to GamerSup about when to release the items.

6145
03:59:46,600 --> 03:59:48,860
I don't know if it's gonna be this month.

6146
03:59:48,900 --> 03:59:50,400
I think it might be this month.

6147
03:59:50,780 --> 03:59:53,400
So, I'll talk to them again about it.

6148
03:59:54,280 --> 03:59:57,900
I think pre-orders are gonna be this month.

6149
03:59:58,340 --> 04:00:02,020
Because they were thinking about pushing it to another month.

6150
04:00:02,160 --> 04:00:06,100
And I was like, oh, I think it would be better if pre-orders were up earlier.

6151
04:00:06,100 --> 04:00:07,160
Just because...

6152
04:00:09,880 --> 04:00:13,960
Because a lot of GamerSup stuff is being released around the same time.

6153
04:00:14,160 --> 04:00:15,300
For this month.

6154
04:00:15,560 --> 04:00:19,820
So they were worried that they might overlap and stuff.

6155
04:00:19,920 --> 04:00:23,500
And I was like, don't worry, my Dragoons will buy my stuff.

6156
04:00:26,520 --> 04:00:30,140
Because it's only gonna be out for pre-orders for two weeks, by the way.

6157
04:00:30,420 --> 04:00:34,760
It's only gonna be out for two weeks for the GamerSup stuff, when my stuff comes out.

6158
04:00:34,760 --> 04:00:37,320
And I'll let you guys know now.

6159
04:00:37,560 --> 04:00:42,160
The amount of pre-orders that the GamerSup is gonna get...

6160
04:00:42,160 --> 04:00:43,840
Will determine if I'm gonna get a flavor.

6161
04:00:46,260 --> 04:00:47,540
Nudge nudge.

6162
04:00:59,880 --> 04:01:02,000
I wonder what that means.

6163
04:01:07,460 --> 04:01:07,880
Um...

6164
04:01:07,880 --> 04:01:09,220
Very subtle, Doki.

6165
04:01:13,320 --> 04:01:14,160
It's just...

6166
04:01:14,880 --> 04:01:15,980
It's just business.

6167
04:01:17,880 --> 04:01:19,480
She does ask for a lot.

6168
04:01:19,660 --> 04:01:20,700
I mean, like...

6169
04:01:20,700 --> 04:01:22,240
It really depends on you guys.

6170
04:01:22,300 --> 04:01:24,140
If you guys don't want a flavor, that's fine by me.

6171
04:01:27,400 --> 04:01:29,200
If you guys don't...

6172
04:01:29,200 --> 04:01:31,920
It's like, oh, you guys want a flavor, then you know what to do.

6173
04:01:32,040 --> 04:01:32,400
I don't...

6174
04:01:32,840 --> 04:01:34,700
If you guys don't want it, then don't buy it.

6175
04:01:42,280 --> 04:01:44,080
We do want it.

6176
04:01:44,460 --> 04:01:46,540
Yeah, so now it's our fault.

6177
04:01:48,180 --> 04:01:49,020
I'm sorry.

6178
04:01:50,320 --> 04:01:51,540
Okay, how about this?

6179
04:01:51,620 --> 04:01:53,440
I'll also buy, like, 30.

6180
04:01:53,740 --> 04:01:54,220
How about that?

6181
04:01:55,580 --> 04:01:58,200
I'll buy, like, 30 of my cups.

6182
04:01:58,360 --> 04:01:59,920
Is that what you want me to say?

6183
04:02:06,100 --> 04:02:06,380
Yeah.

6184
04:02:06,480 --> 04:02:08,340
Guys, finally, physical Doki.

6185
04:02:08,480 --> 04:02:09,280
Thank you.

6186
04:02:11,160 --> 04:02:12,580
I'll just, like, invest.

6187
04:02:12,720 --> 04:02:13,820
Isn't that, like, illegal?

6188
04:02:14,180 --> 04:02:15,960
Like, not buying your...

6189
04:02:15,960 --> 04:02:16,880
Wait, okay.

6190
04:02:17,220 --> 04:02:18,280
Thank you for the super chat.

6191
04:02:18,360 --> 04:02:18,860
Thank you, thank you.

6192
04:02:18,920 --> 04:02:19,560
Any flavor ideas?

6193
04:02:19,660 --> 04:02:20,260
I have no idea.

6194
04:02:20,320 --> 04:02:21,400
I don't even know if I'm going to get it.

6195
04:02:22,420 --> 04:02:24,100
I don't even know if I'm going to get it.

6196
04:02:24,100 --> 04:02:26,920
But, like, I know, like, people do that.

6197
04:02:27,760 --> 04:02:28,320
So...

6198
04:02:28,320 --> 04:02:29,880
On Amazon Books...

6199
04:02:29,880 --> 04:02:32,260
For Amazon Books, they would...

6200
04:02:32,260 --> 04:02:34,840
People would buy their own books.

6201
04:02:35,020 --> 04:02:35,860
For Amazon.

6202
04:02:36,360 --> 04:02:39,320
So they can pump up their own rankings.

6203
04:02:39,860 --> 04:02:43,560
So they'll show up as, like, a number one bestseller on Amazon.

6204
04:02:43,960 --> 04:02:47,080
If they buy, like, a lot of their own books.

6205
04:02:47,300 --> 04:02:48,840
Like, people actually do that.

6206
04:02:48,860 --> 04:02:50,560
Which is crazy to think about.

6207
04:02:52,120 --> 04:02:52,680
Anyway...

6208
04:02:55,080 --> 04:02:55,960
I'm not...

6209
04:02:55,960 --> 04:02:57,460
I'm not going to say if I'm going to do it or not.

6210
04:03:04,320 --> 04:03:07,040
But I'll put the idea in your head.

6211
04:03:07,280 --> 04:03:08,100
I'll put the idea...

6212
04:03:08,720 --> 04:03:09,600
I'll put the...

6213
04:03:09,600 --> 04:03:12,000
I'll put the idea in your head.

6214
04:03:13,380 --> 04:03:13,740
Ehhhhhh...

6215
04:03:21,740 --> 04:03:22,100
Um...

6216
04:03:23,740 --> 04:03:25,800
Gamersubs bestseller chart topic.

6217
04:03:27,680 --> 04:03:28,040
Anyway.

6218
04:03:29,720 --> 04:03:30,400
