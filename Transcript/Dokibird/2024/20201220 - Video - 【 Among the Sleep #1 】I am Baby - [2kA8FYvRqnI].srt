00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:05,320
Why doesn't it let me peek around corners?

225
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:11,520

And she's seen me so distant.

464
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:31,060

There is no fucking way I am playing- Layers of fear.

528
00:38:24,870 --> 00:38:26,690
It might bring us to her.

529
00:38:28,030 --> 00:38:29,710
It looks like we need three more.

530
00:38:30,110 --> 00:38:34,230
No, I streamed yesterday, so it's just because I was for the
sub goal.

531
00:38:34,950 --> 00:38:39,890
But holy- I am not streaming layers of fear unless- Unless
it's a sub goal.

532
00:38:40,090 --> 00:38:43,270
There is, there's no fucking way in fucking play.

533
00:38:45,450 --> 00:38:47,410
There's no way in fucking play.

534
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:49,230
Look at some fear after that.
