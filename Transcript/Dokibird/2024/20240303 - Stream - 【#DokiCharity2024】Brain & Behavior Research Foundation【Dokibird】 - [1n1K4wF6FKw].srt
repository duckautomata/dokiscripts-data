22
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:07,180
assistant um helping me they've like they actually contacted
the foundation because at first tiltify um the auction thing

23
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:15,220
was actually a closed beta option and i didn't find out
about it until tuesday

24
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:25,540
i didn't realize it was because i thought that it was open
to everybody so on tuesday i getting ready to set up the

25
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:32,020
auction and then i looked at it and i was like wait a minute
it's closed beta and i was like freaking out i was like oh

26
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:41,120
my god guys i was like guys it's closed beta can you guys
like contact tiltafi and like tell them to grant me special

27
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:50,900
permission because i really wanted to access the auction and
um so little men um they helped they were in contacts with

28
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:59,580
tiltify staff and actually gave me the beta like the option
because like the auction is like reserved for like really

29
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:07,020
big streamers and stuff like that so like obviously like um
uh kitty cunerella for twitch uh did like a auction stream

30
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:13,940
as well as a lot of big streamers use the auction auction
feature on tiltify i didn't realize that it was reserved for

31
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:17,160
like really big streamers and events so i was just like fuck

32
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:25,160
I was just like, oh shit, okay, that, okay, I fucked up
there.

33
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,840
I didn't realize that was a thing.

34
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:40,560
So, um, so, um, like I said, a huge shout out to, uh, Little
Men for helping me get in touch with Tiltify, like Tiltify

35
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:44,580
people to give me the power to be able to host an auction.

36
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:56,240
but not only holy shit 16 000 oh my god okay to be fair okay
at first i didn't want to include the auction like the

37
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:02,400
auction fits into like the stretch goals but i decide that's
not really fucking fair and it's all for charity so like i'm

38
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,820
like you know what dokey be nice

39
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:18,440
give the dragoons give the dragoons a bone it's all for
charity I was like, okay, it's all for charity.

40
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:23,160
I will add the auction to the stretch goals as well.

41
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:37,500
Anyway, anyway, as I was saying, as I was saying, because of
that, then I realized the Brain and Behavior Research

42
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:40,360
Foundation was not on the list for auctions.

43
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:41,820
I was like, fuck.

44
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:51,540
because like when we got access to the auction i was like
okay uh little man was like all right you can do it you can

45
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:57,480
you can host auctions now and i was like yay and i was like
trying to do it and i was like wait where's brain and

46
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:06,700
behavior research foundation they're on tiltify but why
aren't they on the auction and then so then little man had

47
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:14,880
to like um get in touch with the brain and Behavior Research
Foundation organization and, you know, they actually had

48
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:23,380
like a context within the organization and they managed to,
the organization, the foundation managed to connect their

49
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:27,980
account to Tiltify to receive auction donations and
everything.

50
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:31,980
And that way, we were able to do that yesterday morning.

51
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:40,020
They actually, we have had everything set up at like five in
the morning on Friday, five in the morning on Friday.

52
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:50,180
And then on Friday, they worked on putting everything, all
the items and everything onto the auction list.

53
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:59,520
And they were the ones, Little Man was the ones that were in
contact with all the creators and all the creators and like

54
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:08,300
uh all the artists and all the wonderful creative people
around the world in coordinating all the items that are

55
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:15,700
going to be made uh for that was going to be made for this
auction so like i said a huge shout out to little man for

56
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:23,600
doing all of this it's really amazing i didn't have to i had
to do all this myself i had incredible help from little man

57
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:30,820
especially with contacting all the official people helping
me write all the business emails so I don't have to write

58
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:40,380
the I think that's like the best part I don't have to write
the business emails anymore like I think that's the part

59
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:50,180
that makes me the happiest because like you know writing
emails fucking suck I hate I hate I hate writing business

60
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:58,120
emails I hate writing like professional emails so like huge
shout out to Little Man for helping me write the

61
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:12,000
professional emails especially contacting like Tiltify and
contacting Tiltify and Brain and Behavior Research

62
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:12,760
Foundation.

63
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:19,440
Also I want to say thank you to everybody that applied to be
part of the auction.

64
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:27,700
It was incredibly difficult picking the creators because I
didn't want to have like Like, you know, like, fool, like

65
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:30,960
overwhelm everybody with a lot of items and everything.

66
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:40,440
So it was very difficult for me to pick, like, the items
that I want for the auction themselves.

67
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:48,460
So we actually got more than 200 applicants to be part of
the auction.

68
00:12:49,260 --> 00:13:01,620
It was very, very difficult deciding, like, narrowing down
200 people um um little man actually helped out in helping

69
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:10,080
me narrow down the first round and in the second round i had
a hundred and like i think it was like 300 applicants i

70
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:19,440
believe it was around like 300 plus applicants and little
man narrowed it down to 180 for me and then from that 180 i

71
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:27,860
had to pick around 30 people um i don't actually know the
exact number i've picked but like from a hundred and eighty

72
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:40,780
I had to narrow it down even further to what we have now um
like I said it was incredibly difficult picking like uh the

73
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:51,340
people to uh to be part of this auction um and I want to say
thank you again to all everybody who are donating um the the

74
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:57,900
items um I told everybody that i was willing to uh chip in
and fund because i didn't i was there was like a paid

75
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:06,740
opportunity um but like also like a huge uh thank you to
those who uh wish to donate those profits to uh to charity

80
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,240
train of thought.

81
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,380
What was I saying?

82
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:56,060
What was I already lost my train of thought right now?

83
00:14:58,220 --> 00:14:58,920
Holy shit.

84
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:06,040
Okay, um, anyway, anyway, like I was saying, it was
incredible.

85
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:15,600
It is just crazy because, like, I'm so happy to be able to
do something like this, to be able to do an auction for you

86
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:20,260
guys because like it allows me to work with so many talented
people.

87
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:24,500
All the items in the auction is one of a kind.

88
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:25,480
Two of kind.

89
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:26,100
I mean

90
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,480
mostly one of a kind.

91
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:38,640
Because I might have one too but like this doesn't matter.

92
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,580
Exclusive, one-of-a-kind.

93
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:56,820
Okay, okay, look, I will also own it one too, okay, but that
doesn't count.

94
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:01,200
I will also own, yes, I will have the piece of paper.

95
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,480
It's literally paper that I own.

96
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:12,280
Okay, but it will be one-of-a-kind for the dragoons.

97
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:21,360
me okay i will also own one as well so then we're matching
look i've had this argument already with my members okay

98
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:35,680
guys it means we will be matching is and that raises the
value okay guys us having matching items raises the value of

99
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:39,840
the item itself because we will be matching

100
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:46,340
It is limited edition paper!

101
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:48,260
It's my paper!

102
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:51,920
Who else would have touched the paper other than me?

103
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,440
Just think about it!

104
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:01,480
It literally has my fingerprints on...

105
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,140
Okay, wait, actually, I'm going to touch it with gloves.

106
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:03,880
I'm...

107
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:07,460
No, that's actually pretty bad if it has my fingerprints on
it.

108
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:12,720
I would be touching the paper with a...

109
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:25,840
glove so it would sadly not have my fingerprints on it it
will not have my fingerprints on the paper because i

110
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:30,440
realized that's a bit scary to give away

111
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:47,360
also um i am providing the money for shipping for all of
these items so do not worry if you're wherever you live

112
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:54,780
you're like oh my god would they be able to ship it there I
will be providing the money for the shipping to the creators

113
00:17:54,780 --> 00:18:03,400
who will be shipping these products to you if you win the
auction um and also um even if like some of the items are

114
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:13,420
not made by me it's not coming from me I will be sending an
exclusive postcard to the each winner of the auction Each

115
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:24,940
winner of the auction will have will be able to receive a an
exclusive postcard made Just for this event How are we

116
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:26,780
already I it's crazy.

117
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:38,680
It's actually guys the the insane The insane amount of
support from from everybody like we were just starting I'm

118
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:48,540
just explaining the event right now and like I'm like
refreshing the like auction page and seeing everything's

119
00:18:48,540 --> 00:19:03,860
been bid it's insane everything has been like already bid on
and uh and like oh my god there's so much money like i said

120
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:13,540
all the money goes directly towards um it goes directly
towards the foundation it doesn't go to me it goes directly

121
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:23,520
straight to the foundation like um the everything's already
connected to like their accounts so um they uh 100 receive

122
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:28,620
the money i don't receive anything for those who are like oh
my god don't care you're gonna receive any no i will not be

123
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:43,940
receiving any of the money it goes directly to them via
tiltify so um for those who want to know um what is the uh

124
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:53,260
the brain and behavior research foundation um they um they
are a charity that looks at providing funding into research

125
00:19:53,260 --> 00:20:02,300
for cures and better treatment for uh mental illness so um
so like this is like a global thing it's not like uh it's

126
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:11,680
not like within one particular country it looks into uh
treatments and cures for um global treatment like basically

127
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:20,140
global research for mental illness and mental disorders so
um they provide majority of funding to because i know

128
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:27,500
there's a lot of charities that are going into like um like
salaries and programs and stuff like that and like all about

129
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:36,340
the the like the offices and stuff, but this, the reason why
I chose the Brain and Behavior Research Foundation is that

130
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:44,420
majority of the funding, like majority of the money that is
raised for this charity organization, for this foundation

131
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:50,420
goes directly to the research, um, and funding the research
and stuff.

132
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:58,100
And because I chose it because of also the global appeal,
because, you know, finding cures and finding treatments.

133
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:03,180
It's not like, it's not like, you know, centered around one
country.

134
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:11,800
If they find a cure or a better way to treat something for
mental illness, like people around the world will be able to

135
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:14,560
go for the medicine for it as well.

136
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:17,760
So it's not like, oh, you have to go to this country to be
able to receive it.

137
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:18,960
It is a cure.

138
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:27,620
It is a better treatment for people around the world and
that is why I chose this as um that's why I chose the brain

139
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:35,280
behavior research foundation for this particular event for
the one for the charity and also because people around the

140
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:44,640
world can also donate to this as well um and because I've
set up the YouTube thing the YouTube fundraising thing um

141
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:54,720
which is more about weight raising awareness raising
programs like a better support system for people with mental

142
00:21:54,720 --> 00:22:03,440
illness with mental disorders on the YouTube one because it
was something I could do like quick and instantly and

143
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:10,200
something I wanted to do on YouTube for to because like you
know a lot of people eyes were on me and it was like the

144
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:18,000
thing I can do right away to help out and the mental health
America helps with that so mental health America is more so

145
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,800
about raising awareness and providing support structures and
programs.

146
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:28,520
Well, the Brain and Behavior Research Foundation is more
about trying to find the cure and finding better treatment.

147
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:36,900
And so that's why I felt like, you know, do have two of
these at around the same time is the best, like, way

148
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:37,580
regarding this.

149
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:44,600
So one, if you want to donate to the research, you can go
with the Brain and Behavior Research Foundation for the one

150
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,280
regarding mental health awareness.

151
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:55,640
the mental health america that you can donate via uh the
waiting room the one the mental of america is sadly only has

152
00:22:55,640 --> 00:23:02,860
like specific countries can be able to donate via them uh
via the waiting room and that's why i made the tiltify for

153
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:10,380
like global donations so you don't have to worry about like
oh uh will will they be able to accept my donation because i

154
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:16,200
saw there's a lot of issue regarding it on the waiting room
was that a lot of countries were not able to donate to the

155
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:22,880
waiting room and That is why I decided to do this particular
stream and this auction to raise money for a second charity

156
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:33,220
as well Another 5k guys, I was doing a fucking TED talk Holy

00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:01,360

that cookie cutter don't stream snip that troll boy but now

193
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:20,360
I want a keyboard because the paper is too damn expensive

194
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:26,800
Okay, who's getting him?

195
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,000
Okay, that one is good.

196
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:29,320
That one's actually really good.

197
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,460
I actually like that.

198
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:31,240
Here you go.

199
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:40,740
You get to be on the stream until somebody snipes you, and
then you're off the screen.

200
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:41,600
And then you're off the screen again.

201
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,660
You're on the screen again.

202
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:45,140
Jesus Christ.

203
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:55,540
Also, for those who are worried, like, if the winning bid is
unable to pay for the item, it will go automatically go

204
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:57,260
towards the second winner.

205
00:26:57,460 --> 00:27:03,140
You will have, like, around, I think, like, one to two days
to pay for the item.

206
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:08,700
If you're unable to, it will go towards the second winning,
like, the second winner.

207
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:16,340
So, just to be, like, there is, like, a backup, like, a plan
B, if that happens, type deal.

208
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,760
Why bid when you can't pay?

209
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:22,240
Because, like, they thought they had the...

210
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,660
I would assume they thought they had the money.

211
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:32,600
and then suddenly they're like wow the paper went to four
thousand dollars let's see what's on my bank account oh hey

212
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:37,480
four thousand like three thousand nine hundred dollars

213
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:50,100
like i feel like i feel like you know nobody would expect
that you know nobody would expect that to

214
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:59,300
Anyway, yeah, and also, emergencies can happen, obviously.

215
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:03,920
Oh, my God.

216
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:04,320
All right.

217
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:06,760
So, so, okay.

218
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:15,400
Let me go through each of the items, as well as the creator
who go into detail of each of the...

219
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,420
It's like, what are those, like, infomercial?

220
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:20,920

All right.

257
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:10,010

00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:18,790
It's apparently 2 million SHU.

259
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:24,810
I will show it later.

260
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:27,270
We will do this after I talk about it.

261
00:30:27,290 --> 00:30:37,790
After I talk about the charity, about the auction items,
guys, there's other stuff I want to talk about before we get

262
00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:39,990
to the hot sauce.

263
00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:46,750
There's so many things I haven't done on the stretch clothes
yet.

264
00:30:46,990 --> 00:30:49,750
I haven't even, like, talked about the stretch.

265
00:30:49,930 --> 00:30:54,570
We haven't gone to any of the actual content of the charity
event.

266
00:30:54,570 --> 00:31:05,590
What I've been talking about is just like monitoring what
the fuck is going on Oh my god, wait, I love this I love

267
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:17,570
like how they're like fighting so hard right now Over the
piece of paper Over the piece of keyboard Okay, I like this

268
00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:32,140
Um So it's between these two people right now um these two
people are are fighting it out for the keyboard this is not

269
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:39,520
the paper this is for the keyboard now i honestly will not
be surprised if troll boy is gonna like bounce in between

270
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:53,740
like different auction items just to win something i will
not be surprised anyway um anyway does any as i was saying

271
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:59,020
does anyone know how far we've raised Currently for the
auction itself chat.

272
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:00,200
I'm actually curious.

273
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:10,480
How far have we currently Raised from just like overall a
52,000?

274
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:15,520
Oh my god What?

275
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:28,680
We made 52,000 from the auction alone By the way, the
auction itself will be 24 hours um so it's going to close

276
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:40,100
tomorrow at uh it's gonna close tomorrow at um i believe 12
p.m psc so it'll give time for those around the world to be

277
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:46,780
able to bid because i know it's like super fucking early
right now in asia like it's like five or six a.m over there

278
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:54,580
so because of that we are making sure the auction um gives
enough time for a bunch of uh dragoons from around the world

279
00:32:54,580 --> 00:33:01,620
to on it so you know they don't have to wake up super early
and to stay up for the rest of the day to like snipe each

280
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:15,860
other anyway i can finally introduce the items okay all
right i will finally be able to introduce the items of which

281
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:24,360
that is going to be part of the auction let me find the
folder um i was more prepared earlier but now i'm like whoa

282
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:32,900
Anyway, the first item that I'll be talking about, okay, I'm
going to refresh.

283
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:38,440
I'm just going to go by order from the, I'm going to go by
order from the site itself.

284
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:56,780
So, the first item is the, we have like several amazing
sculptures and figure makers, like I said, this is all like

285
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:58,080
one of a kind.

286
00:33:58,840 --> 00:33:59,940
to the dragons.

287
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:03,920
Some might say it's two of a kind because I will also own
one.

288
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:08,840
But let's all just agree that it is one of a kind.

289
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:13,140
It will never be released.

290
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:13,820
Re-released.

291
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:15,440
You will own.

292
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:18,080
It's one plus one equals one.

293
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:26,340
One plus one equals one.

294
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:27,500
By the way, guys.

295
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:42,540
so um quick maths right there anyway anyway as i was saying
only one in public circulation yes i like that only one in

296
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:57,600
public circulation so as i was saying um the first item on
the list is um um is a custom doki sculpture uh by exeon

297
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:05,840
figures i don't know I'm so sorry if like I am
mispronouncing uh your name because I'm very bad at that so

298
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:15,440
this is the um this is not the actual figure itself um this
is an example of of what they can do so you will have input

299
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:27,080
on the sculpture itself um in the design but uh this is an
example of the type of sculptures and sculpting they can do

300
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:36,420
um they can give you two options for this obviously one is
the file to print your own sculpture like 3d print your own

301
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:43,900
sculpture if you do have a 3d printer and painted it
yourself or the creator of the sculpture a custom doki

00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:51,920
sculpture yes yes yes it's bay but like it's the example
they have because you By winning this auction, you can have

You can have your input on how it would look like.

305
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:11,000
And basically, the second option is that they can make an
unpainted resin version of...

306
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:17,800

So it's not just a case, by the way.

322
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:51,960
I know some people were wondering if it's like just a PC
case or not, but it will also be a Fully customized PC that

323
00:37:51,960 --> 00:38:02,320

00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:34,660
This is actually from a user named Celeste Fleur, who is
using a Hyatt case, just so you guys know.

328
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:38,640
I just wanted to clarify for those who are confused.

329
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:42,260
This is actually just using a Hyatt case.

330
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:47,220
So it will be, so it's valued at 3,500.

331
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:57,560
um including the parts itself and like the decorations and
everything um and yeah so it's not just a case i know a lot

cookie cutters.

339

Rimon wanted to the charity auction because I actually very

404
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:58,240
heavily admire Riri stuff ever since like I saw them at
artist alley they won't know who I am it's been years I

405
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:07,920
actually own multiple items from Riri like for years because
like they are like they've been like doing artist alley for

406
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:13,640
like a really really long time so like actually i've like
seen them at convention and i've actually they will never

407
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:25,460
know they'll never know who it was so i've actually heavily
admiring me because i've actually owned several um of their

408
00:46:25,460 --> 00:46:34,680
i like uh merch that they've made um in artist alleys and uh
so yeah i'm really really happy that they're part of the

409
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:35,640
charity auction

410
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:40,740
Bro, it wasn't even four years ago.

411
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:43,020
It might be like eight years ago.

412
00:46:44,380 --> 00:46:49,860
They've been like, they've been doing artist alley and like
selling stuff online for so long.

413
00:46:49,980 --> 00:46:53,520
Like it wouldn't even be four years, maybe like eight.

414
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:56,820
Maybe like eight years ago.

415
00:46:57,200 --> 00:47:00,960
Like they are like a veteran to artist alley and
conventions.

416
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:01,720
Okay.

417
00:47:01,780 --> 00:47:05,960
And then I like, I will not be surprised if Ryo was like, I
have not been selling for eight years.

418
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:06,500
Like,

419
00:47:10,340 --> 00:47:12,560
And before they come in, it caught me.

420
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:16,340
I was like, Doki, I have not been selling for eight years.

421
00:47:16,660 --> 00:47:18,240
That is not true.

422
00:47:23,180 --> 00:47:23,820
Okay.

423
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:27,700
Well, it felt like eight years, okay?

424
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:30,120
It felt like eight years.

425
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:35,960
Anyway, it is a sticker book with exclusive stickers.

426
00:47:36,460 --> 00:47:38,680
Obviously, I believe the stickers will be based around me.

427
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:48,260
Unless they're random stickers, but I think it's healthy to
assume it's gonna be about me You're right.

428
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:55,900
I'm a veteran a hard and I do it I do it I was like eight
years does feel a really long time though So like maybe it

429
00:47:55,900 --> 00:48:04,100
wasn't eight years, but I knew I just know that I was I
bought something from her Maybe eight years ago

that are um that is that everybody chose a different outfit.

460
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:13,540
A lot of people chose different outfits.

461
00:51:13,740 --> 00:51:14,700
It's not just one outfit.

462
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:16,880
Obviously, I had many, many outfits.

463
00:51:18,940 --> 00:51:28,140
So it's really nice because it's like all different outfits
are represented in the auction.

464
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:31,700
So there's like a particular dokey fashion that you like.

465
00:51:32,140 --> 00:51:33,940
Maybe you'll find it in one of the auctions.

466
00:51:35,020 --> 00:51:38,560
Anyway, so this is by Rimi Plushy.

489
00:53:16,050 --> 00:53:25,390
what is it what's it i was so confused i was actually
incredibly confused and then i had to like google google it

there.

492
00:53:37,670 --> 00:53:44,950
Anyway, it will be a one of a kind in public circulation.

493
00:53:46,230 --> 00:53:47,470
Doki Bird.

494
00:53:48,790 --> 00:53:51,630
I-E-M from Kutari Audio.

495
00:53:52,650 --> 00:53:54,490
So it's like fancy earphones.

496
00:53:55,250 --> 00:53:58,770
So I love to show you guys the designs they sent me.

497
00:53:59,170 --> 00:54:02,790
Because I have to look at pictures to actually realize like
what is that?

498
00:54:04,110 --> 00:54:14,010
I'm sorry I'm not good with like technical stuff guys I'm
not good with like technology okay to an extent I am okay

499
00:54:14,010 --> 00:54:27,510
with technology to an extent but like I was so confused
because I didn't know what the fuck IEM was so this would be

500
00:54:27,510 --> 00:54:37,450
like the concept that they've like given us um so you can
Oshimark and my colors and everything.

501
00:54:38,590 --> 00:54:43,490
So you can have like, you know, like I said, one of a kind
in public circulation.

502
00:54:44,430 --> 00:54:44,990
Typical V2.

503
00:54:45,030 --> 00:54:47,850
Yes, I get all my knowledge from other people.

504
00:54:52,530 --> 00:54:59,410
So this is like the concept, the concept render of what it
will look like.

505
00:54:59,810 --> 00:55:05,070
And then they also sent like a box of like the packaging and
everything.

506
00:55:05,690 --> 00:55:12,210
So there's actually, it will also come with like a sticker,
an exclusive sticker made for it as well.

507
00:55:12,530 --> 00:55:15,950
As well as there's like a lot of things going on with it.

508
00:55:16,470 --> 00:55:19,710
So there's also gonna be like exclusive box art and stuff.

509
00:55:20,650 --> 00:55:22,390

The paper.

513
00:55:30,950 --> 00:55:32,390
There it is.

00:55:33,350 --> 00:55:45,350

I believe it also includes a chain for it as well.

00:57:09,670 --> 00:57:15,270
So you got to have your chunky goon with you on your neck at
all times.

Yes, it is life size.

543
01:00:04,810 --> 01:00:11,290
It is very accurate to how I actually am proportional.

544
01:00:16,370 --> 01:00:18,690
It's all ways.

545
01:00:22,710 --> 01:00:23,790

546
01:00:24,230 --> 01:00:25,170

Alright, anyway.

548
01:00:27,690 --> 01:00:28,230
Anyway.

549
01:00:28,930 --> 01:00:31,870
Yeah, it's automatically accurate.

550
01:00:32,550 --> 01:00:34,050
The anatomy is very accurate.

551
01:00:34,470 --> 01:00:35,030
All right, anyway.

552
01:00:36,230 --> 01:00:40,250
Anyway, that is this item in the auction.

553
01:00:40,830 --> 01:00:42,050
All right, next up.

554
01:00:42,430 --> 01:00:43,210
Next up.

555
01:00:43,610 --> 01:00:45,910
This is not a physical item.

556
01:00:46,230 --> 01:00:47,550
So there is no picture.

557
01:00:47,790 --> 01:00:49,270
There is no picture.

558
01:00:49,730 --> 01:00:51,970
This is not a physical item.

559
01:00:52,550 --> 01:00:58,910
This is basically, I will collab with an indie or streamer
of your choice.

560
01:00:59,490 --> 01:01:10,150
So I'm just going to read out the description, but
basically, if you win this auction, you can pick an indie

561
01:01:10,150 --> 01:01:17,170
VTuber or like a streamer of your choice, who is your
favorite streamer, and you want to give them like a big

562
01:01:17,170 --> 01:01:23,630
break, you want to have more eyes on them, and I will try to
reach out to them for a collab.

563
01:01:24,550 --> 01:01:28,430
Obviously, it is up to their choice if they wish to collab
with me.

564
01:01:29,850 --> 01:01:37,250
And if they do decline, obviously you'll have to give me a
plan B on who to reach out after.

565
01:01:39,970 --> 01:01:47,690
So I decided to do this to maybe, like, if you want to give,
like, a chance to one of your favorite streamers who might

566
01:01:47,690 --> 01:01:53,510
not be big in the streaming community and have a chance to
have a lot of eyes on them.

567
01:01:55,170 --> 01:01:58,910
And be able to maybe have this, like, a big break for them
as well.

568
01:01:58,930 --> 01:02:04,070
So that is one of the, this is the one, the non-physical
items.

569
01:02:05,910 --> 01:02:09,010
Non-physical items that I'm giving.

570
01:02:10,910 --> 01:02:17,110
But yeah, anyway, next item on the list is also a
non-physical item.

571
01:02:19,030 --> 01:02:21,310
Pick a game for me to stream.

572
01:02:21,890 --> 01:02:28,870
So if there is a game that you've always wanted me to
stream, but I chose to ignore you.

573
01:02:33,550 --> 01:02:51,970
I will not be able to ignore you anymore by winning this
auction except for Visage because that is a stretch goal so

574
01:02:51,970 --> 01:03:04,790
by winning this auction for pick a game for me to stream you
can forced me to stream your favorite game to completion on

575
01:03:04,790 --> 01:03:05,230
stream.

576
01:03:05,890 --> 01:03:08,270
So, it will not be to 100%.

577
01:03:08,270 --> 01:03:11,530
It will be to, like, the end of the story.

578
01:03:11,970 --> 01:03:14,310
And that is within TOS, obviously.

579
01:03:14,730 --> 01:03:16,190
Like, so I can stream it.

580
01:03:17,490 --> 01:03:20,490
And, like, there is no MMOs.

581
01:03:20,750 --> 01:03:22,330
MMOs are not allowed.

582
01:03:23,050 --> 01:03:24,910
Just so you guys are wondering.

583
01:03:25,670 --> 01:03:31,790
MMOs are not allowed by winning this because There's no way
to fucking complete MMOs

584
01:03:34,830 --> 01:03:43,170
But I will stream it to completion Obviously if you try to
be like super cheeky And be like Oh my god What about

585
01:03:43,170 --> 01:03:53,270
Destiny 2 Because there's no end to Destiny 2 Because they
will keep releasing missions And like stories and DLCs That

586
01:03:53,270 --> 01:04:02,770
is not allowed I can like Alright you can't be cheeky on
this You can't I'm giving you a chance to be like play an

587
01:04:02,770 --> 01:04:14,450
RPG game like a JRPG game because I choose not to play JRPG
games because I know I know that like for me like JRPGs and

588
01:04:14,450 --> 01:04:25,450
me just do not mix very well I haven't found one that I
actually enjoyed so this is your chance to force me if you

589
01:04:25,450 --> 01:04:32,850
win the bid to force me to stream a JRPG Especially when
JRPGs are like fucking 100 plus hour fucking streams, even

590
01:04:32,850 --> 01:04:34,370
if you're speed running to the end.

591
01:04:36,630 --> 01:04:38,990
But yeah, if you win the auction, obviously.

592
01:04:40,250 --> 01:04:42,230
Anyway, next item on the list.

593
01:04:50,900 --> 01:04:52,100
It is.

594
01:04:54,940 --> 01:04:56,520
The piece of paper.

595
01:05:04,020 --> 01:05:09,340
This is the next item on the list.

596
01:05:09,840 --> 01:05:14,700
It is your fucking A4 paper where I will sign.

597
01:05:14,980 --> 01:05:17,840
I will cover it up with my sign.

598
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:19,400
How did that go in up?

599
01:05:20,060 --> 01:05:21,400
Three minutes ago?

600
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:25,980
You haven't been bidding for like one hour that you came
back?

601
01:05:29,080 --> 01:05:32,760
This person hasn't bid for an hour?

602
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:36,020
And then, like, they're like, this is it.

603
01:05:36,180 --> 01:05:37,540
This is my time to shine now.

604
01:05:37,980 --> 01:05:38,240
No.

605
01:05:42,460 --> 01:05:45,200
And then, I'm waiting for...

606
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:47,620
Anyway, they just, like, showed up.

607
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:50,420
They literally stopped bidding when it was at $3,000.

608
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:53,500
They stopped at $3,000.

609
01:05:54,120 --> 01:05:55,800
And then they had to go to the pick.

610
01:05:56,080 --> 01:05:59,340
Sorry, they had to make, like, a quick deposit real quick,
you know?

611
01:05:59,420 --> 01:06:01,540
They had to do some quick, like...

612
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:15,400
a quick loan real quick to be able to keep going anyway
anyway so this piece yes it's not just a piece of paper I

613
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:21,640
literally wrote that's gonna be a piece of paper covered
with my signature so I'll be like writing my signature on it

614
01:06:21,640 --> 01:06:33,040
um anyway anyway so it's not just a pure white paper I will

I'm sorry, Australians, New Zealanders.

654
01:10:11,090 --> 01:10:13,170

660
01:10:38,710 --> 01:10:48,170
a video on like wobble kid or whatever like like some arts
and crafts youtuber that um that was like introducing the

661
01:10:48,170 --> 01:10:55,810
wobbles and it's some like Royal crochet kit and they were
like I have never done crochet before so we're gonna see if

662
01:10:55,810 --> 01:11:02,630
it is beginner friendly and I was like what the fuck let's
just like watch it like this is beginner friendly I was just

663
01:11:02,630 --> 01:11:10,210
like holy fuck like oh my god I cannot do arts and crafts
arts and crafts is like I can't I don't have like first off

664
01:11:10,210 --> 01:11:17,130
I don't think I have the page the last time I had the
patience for arts and crafts stuff is when I think this is

665
01:11:17,130 --> 01:11:26,030
like I don't know this is like a this is an Asian thing like
when you're a kid but there's these like arts and crafts

666
01:11:26,030 --> 01:11:38,780
where you can fold the paper into these like triangle pieces
um but you draw that's art drawing is just art there's no

667
01:11:38,780 --> 01:11:49,600
crafting in there's no there's no crafting is just art
anyway anyway it's not I mean it's Not really origami.

668
01:11:49,720 --> 01:11:50,820
I'm not talking about origami.

669
01:11:51,060 --> 01:11:53,820
But, like, it's like using origami to make something.

670
01:11:54,360 --> 01:11:57,020
But, like, it's basically you make these little triangle
things.

671
01:11:57,200 --> 01:12:01,640
And then you piece these triangle things together into a
structure.

672
01:12:02,260 --> 01:12:06,780
Um, and I used to do that, um, as a kid.

673
01:12:07,100 --> 01:12:09,540
Like, I would follow a lot of these, like, triangles.

674
01:12:10,060 --> 01:12:12,360
And then it would be like, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop,
boop, boop.

675
01:12:12,540 --> 01:12:13,500
And then there's Doraimo.

676
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:15,680
I have one.

677
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:18,200
Because they always sell them at Daiso.

678
01:12:18,220 --> 01:12:28,140
I remember as a kid They always had these kids at Daiso And
then I would buy like the hamster I have the hamster one And

679
01:12:28,140 --> 01:12:36,740
then I had like Doraemon And then I did that I did that as a
kid Is that what it's called?

680
01:12:37,140 --> 01:12:47,040
The Tandgram But yeah that was like the extent of my
crafting I also did like plushie making For school But like

681
01:12:47,040 --> 01:12:49,620
it was It was a bit of a mess.

682
01:12:51,620 --> 01:12:54,020
It was a bit of a mess.

683
01:12:55,580 --> 01:12:56,060
Holy shit.

684
01:12:56,500 --> 01:12:58,200
We're $48,000?

685
01:12:59,400 --> 01:12:59,900
Oh my.

686
01:13:00,020 --> 01:13:00,320
Don't worry.

687
01:13:00,380 --> 01:13:03,100
I have a list of stretch goals just in case this happened.

688
01:13:03,500 --> 01:13:05,320
I was like a little bit.

689
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:06,600
I was like, okay.

690
01:13:06,980 --> 01:13:10,840
Thinking up stretch goals is like one of the hardest,
honestly, one of the hardest things ever.

691
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:12,600
Because I'm like, what the fuck do people want?

692
01:13:12,840 --> 01:13:18,200
Like I was just like, what the fuck do people want?

693
01:13:18,220 --> 01:13:27,160
what do you want so I had like an huge list of things anyway
after I introduce all the auction items I'll talk about the

694
01:13:27,160 --> 01:13:38,900
stretch goals with which we've practically mostly hit
already like we're ready mostly there on the ones that are

695
01:13:38,900 --> 01:13:53,660
officially on the stretch goals anyway the next item it is
not a physical pick the next official doki outfit so what

696
01:13:53,660 --> 01:14:04,320
that means is that you get to you get to help pick decide
the theme and help design like and give your input give your

697
01:14:04,320 --> 01:14:15,680
input on on on what my next official outfit is going to be
the one after you know not this not after this but like

698
01:14:15,680 --> 01:14:29,500
after the other way so um so obviously it has to be within
tos youtube twitch friendly for streaming so i can actually

699
01:14:29,500 --> 01:14:39,920
wear it on stream so so by winning this auction you can be
part of the process and part of like deciding like you know

700
01:14:39,920 --> 01:14:46,900
we'll be sending you like artwork concept art and get to
decide like pick between the concept art and give input on

701
01:14:46,900 --> 01:14:54,820
what you want included in the concept art obviously you're
not going to be paying for the the fucking outfit i will be

702
01:14:54,820 --> 01:15:00,180
paying for the outfit so you don't have to worry about like
paying for charity and also the outfit itself like the

703
01:15:00,180 --> 01:15:07,200
illustration for the outfit do not worry i will be paying
for the skin suit being made like with the the rigging and

704
01:15:07,200 --> 01:15:16,600
everything do not worry i will be paying for the laundry of
the skin suit and the crafting of the skin suit.

705
01:15:16,740 --> 01:15:18,940
So you don't have to worry about that.

706
01:15:19,540 --> 01:15:21,540
You get to be part of the process.

707
01:15:22,620 --> 01:15:23,800
So that is okay.

708
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:27,840
So that's all you have to pay after the auction.

709
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:34,420
Next item on the list is a...

710
01:15:34,420 --> 01:15:37,500
Okay, let me put it up on the screen.

711
01:15:37,780 --> 01:15:40,580
Let me see if I find the right picture.

712
01:15:41,280 --> 01:15:43,260
So the next item...

713
01:15:43,420 --> 01:15:44,900
It's not this piece of paper.

714
01:15:45,060 --> 01:15:45,780
It's a concept art.

715
01:15:48,640 --> 01:15:53,680
The next item is a dragon wood carving.

716
01:15:54,040 --> 01:15:58,900
This is the concept art of the wood carving itself.

717
01:16:00,140 --> 01:16:07,120
So they have, they've actually sent in multiple like stuff
they've done in the past.

718
01:16:07,840 --> 01:16:13,060
So here is like something they've, oh my god, this fucking
picture is ginormous.

719
01:16:13,420 --> 01:16:17,220
So this is like a proof of something they've actually done
before.

720
01:16:18,100 --> 01:16:19,480
And it's made of trees.

721
01:16:19,700 --> 01:16:20,800
So it's almost like paper.

722
01:16:20,920 --> 01:16:21,760
It's the same material.

723
01:16:22,260 --> 01:16:23,900
It's the same fucking material.

724
01:16:26,460 --> 01:16:28,740
So this is like one of the things they've done in the past.

725
01:16:28,900 --> 01:16:32,360
So it's a full wood carving that they've carved themselves.

726
01:16:33,140 --> 01:16:36,260
But instead of that, you would get a dragon.

727
01:16:36,860 --> 01:16:37,620
You would get dragon.

728
01:16:37,800 --> 01:16:40,280
And you can choose between different dragon types.

729
01:16:40,920 --> 01:16:43,180
Like, you know, someone you can add an egg at the bottom
too.

730
01:16:43,420 --> 01:16:58,380
Like, you know, like I said, concept art is subjected to
change, and, um, it is by, uh, Chin, I'm sorry, I, Chin-09

731
01:16:58,380 --> 01:16:59,700
is the artist.

732
01:16:59,780 --> 01:17:04,960
I have to, like, look at it for a second and be like, how do
I pronounce it?

733
01:17:05,300 --> 01:17:05,740
Chin?

734
01:17:06,040 --> 01:17:07,680
I guess there's a one?

735
01:17:07,680 --> 01:17:25,760

931
01:35:15,240 --> 01:35:21,240

01:35:22,080 --> 01:35:35,600
the past so oh my gosh this photo is huge okay all right
this is a custom uh ball jointed doll is 16 inches and it

933
01:35:35,600 --> 01:35:40,800

me that's not me by the way i don't know if you notice i

934
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:51,160
think i know it's hard to tell i know it's almost the same
but this is by doll's jewel or like moonlight jewel um i am

935
01:35:51,160 --> 01:36:03,080
a huge fan of custom doll making um and it would be a joki
version a joki bird version um i am incredible i i love

936
01:36:03,080 --> 01:36:10,980
custom ball jointed dolls in general i love like watching
like doll customization like i i like watched a lot of like

937
01:36:10,980 --> 01:36:17,940
doll lifeo in the past um she's like one of my guilty
pleasure youtubers uh i love that when they do like they

938
01:36:17,940 --> 01:36:24,380
customize like monster high dolls and stuff like that it's
so interesting to watch i've actually like before um like

939
01:36:24,380 --> 01:36:33,760
five years ago i was like actually looking to commission a
dokey ball jointed doll for myself like five years ago i

940
01:36:33,760 --> 01:36:40,640
remember just looking up doll customizers those who like
customize monster and high dolls and everything and um and i

941
01:36:40,640 --> 01:36:46,260
recently started watching moonlight jewel because they've
done a lot of like a lot of customization similar doll

942
01:36:46,260 --> 01:36:56,460
customization and it's honestly really interesting to watch
because it's like very creative what they do and it's like

943
01:36:56,460 --> 01:37:02,200
um i feel like doll customization is very like you know it's
like very difficult to do because you gotta know how to make

944
01:37:02,200 --> 01:37:07,560
clothes you gotta know how to customize like dolls in
general like and then know how to like draw on the eyes

945
01:37:07,560 --> 01:37:17,460
sometimes or like do like custom like painting on the faces
and makeup and stuff like that it's actually crazy uh so um

946
01:37:17,460 --> 01:37:30,580
um so like honestly it is a huge work of art uh and i was
very honored that uh moon jewel a moonlight jewel wanted to

947
01:37:30,580 --> 01:37:39,040
join the auction so uh very beautiful it's honestly um one
of these types of arts and crafts that i really admire and

948
01:37:39,040 --> 01:37:50,480
uh i love watching doll customization in general uh so yeah
uh huge shout out to moonlight jewel uh all right next item

949
01:37:50,480 --> 01:38:00,980
it's another plushie yeah having to paint the eyes is hard
and you also have to deal with like my joki joki joki amber

950
01:38:00,980 --> 01:38:07,840
doge what are you doing you know i have chicken don't you
you know okay the best part is that i don't accidentally say

952
01:38:12,760 --> 01:38:16,340

1014
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:28,700
I bought the entire...

1015
01:43:28,700 --> 01:43:30,080

1016
01:43:30,260 --> 01:43:31,640
Like, they had a lot of stuff.

1017
01:43:31,740 --> 01:43:32,760
They had, like, necklaces.

1018
01:43:33,380 --> 01:43:34,220
They had rings.

1019
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:35,580
I also...

1020
01:43:35,580 --> 01:43:36,500
And then I...

1021
01:43:36,500 --> 01:43:37,240
They also...

1022
01:43:37,240 --> 01:43:38,080
Not in the auction!

1023
01:43:38,400 --> 01:43:40,480
This is just part of my tangents.

1024
01:43:40,700 --> 01:43:42,320
Just so you guys know.

1025
01:43:42,820 --> 01:43:44,360
This is not in the auction.

1026
01:43:45,780 --> 01:43:49,960
So, I bought, like, their entire line of Madoka.

1027
01:43:50,160 --> 01:43:58,020
even this even even this even though I don't have my ears
pierced I also bought this because it's just so beautiful

1028
01:43:58,020 --> 01:44:08,340
and like that is like the extent of my love for Madoka like
only the Madoka series I don't give a fuck about like the

1029
01:44:08,340 --> 01:44:14,060
spin-offs like the one I don't remember rebellion no not
rebellion the one where they're in another city and then

1030
01:44:14,060 --> 01:44:29,240
there's like rip off Madoka with a hood the the gotcha
madoka i don't know record not the same i'm sorry for people

1031
01:44:29,240 --> 01:44:39,880
who actually like the gotcha other like ripoff version of
madoka not the same and apologize to all the people that

1032
01:44:39,880 --> 01:44:45,960
spent thousands of dollars on that gotcha game only for them
to shut it down this is why you spend

1033
01:44:52,980 --> 01:45:03,220
not my medoka anyway um anyway but like i said yeah like
like i don't care about the spin-offs i just care about the

1034
01:45:03,220 --> 01:45:12,340
original all right next item next item where are we next
item oh this one's a fan favorite i believe i believe this

1035
01:45:12,340 --> 01:45:19,560
one is a a fan favorite it was so funny because we were um
someone said during the member stream when i was showing

1036
01:45:19,560 --> 01:45:25,540
like previews of the auction so people I've actually seen
some of these products already So now they're just getting a

1037
01:45:25,540 --> 01:45:33,340
two hour They like paid for no For no ads for like In the
member stream and now they're getting Like an unskippable

1038
01:45:33,340 --> 01:45:42,200
two hour ad Because they're like we were We've already heard
about This in the member stream and Now to hear this again

1039
01:45:45,480 --> 01:46:03,880
Okay Anyway Anyway As I was As I was saying, we have the
next product on here is The Tomato Dragoon plushie We got

1040
01:46:03,880 --> 01:46:06,500
the same as twice

1041
01:46:10,060 --> 01:46:19,180
Alright, do you have a tomato chonkoon Plushie?

1042
01:46:19,320 --> 01:46:23,400
And this is obviously completed She's 15.

1043
01:46:24,100 --> 01:46:29,820
Um, and look at this fucking monster of a tomato goon.

1044
01:46:30,400 --> 01:46:31,420
Look at it.

1045
01:46:34,540 --> 01:46:36,620
He's like, he's like a shiny.

1046
01:46:36,920 --> 01:46:40,020
But instead of a shiny variant, you're a tomato.

1047
01:46:40,500 --> 01:46:46,760
So like, the shiny variant of dragoons is basically their
shape like tomatoes.

1048
01:46:47,100 --> 01:46:56,180
And they're very rare because majority of the time when a
tomato goon is born, they usually don't live past um past uh

1049
01:46:56,180 --> 01:47:03,640
baby because like usually all the dragoons just eat it
because it's a tomato uh or i eat it because it's a tomato

1050
01:47:03,640 --> 01:47:16,100
so like if if a tomato goon lives past baby mode um baby
mode they are like they are very rare it's very very rare

1051
01:47:16,100 --> 01:47:18,720
because they're Like, they're so harvestable.

1052
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:24,860
God, look how harvestable you are.

1053
01:47:28,700 --> 01:47:39,520
So, so it's very lucky that they are able to live past baby
mode and enjoy a very scary life of adulthood.

1054
01:47:40,220 --> 01:47:42,160
Anyway, but yeah, this is tomato.

1055
01:47:43,080 --> 01:47:44,820
They're like dodo's.

1056
01:47:45,020 --> 01:47:46,660
They're the dodo's of the goo.

1057
01:47:46,680 --> 01:48:02,900
basically they're the dodo's of the goons all right next up

So, plushie number 4 by Luna Noctu Arts.

1076
01:49:44,860 --> 01:49:48,880
Um, well-known plushie artists within the VTuber community.

1077
01:49:49,960 --> 01:49:54,120
Uh, this is around 30 to 35 cm tall.

1078
01:49:55,040 --> 01:49:56,900
Uh, this one's not done yet, obviously.

1079
01:49:57,360 --> 01:50:00,960
Um, but, uh, another plushie to look forward to.

1080
01:50:01,380 --> 01:50:03,740
Uh, it's really, I think that's 30 to 35 cm.

1081
01:50:03,920 --> 01:50:05,000
So that's just pretty tall, actually.

1082
01:50:07,740 --> 01:50:11,600
But they have made a lot of plushies within the VTuber
community.

1083
01:50:11,700 --> 01:50:13,960
So you might recognize the work they have done.

1084
01:50:15,060 --> 01:50:18,920
And yeah, it's another, I believe the hat is removed.

1085
01:50:19,040 --> 01:50:20,340
Okay, actually I shouldn't say it.

1086
01:50:20,480 --> 01:50:25,260
I'll be like, if I say the hat is removable, and then the
plushie artist was like, it was not.

1087
01:50:26,340 --> 01:50:29,320
I was just like, but it was never removable.

1088
01:50:29,860 --> 01:50:30,840
What do you mean?

1089
01:50:34,260 --> 01:50:36,580
I don't know if the hat is removable.

1090
01:50:36,900 --> 01:50:39,480
Okay, I don't know if the hat is removable.

1091
01:50:39,720 --> 01:50:40,480
It could be.

1092
01:50:40,980 --> 01:50:41,700
It could be.

1093
01:50:42,020 --> 01:50:44,380
But if it isn't, I won't force them.

1094
01:50:44,540 --> 01:50:56,360
make it removable so it's like trollinger's hat can it or
can it not be removable uh it is to be decided i just add

1095
01:50:56,360 --> 01:51:09,880
dlc like oh i have to redo the pattern now you gotta buy it
to find out exactly exactly if you really want to know i

1096
01:51:09,880 --> 01:51:11,380
guess you just have to buy

1097
01:51:14,540 --> 01:51:22,720
I mean, I guess if that's what it takes, you just have to
buy the hat to find out.

1098
01:51:23,100 --> 01:51:23,480
All right.

1099
01:51:23,920 --> 01:51:27,840
Sorry, I had to take a sip of my drink real fast.

1100
01:51:28,160 --> 01:51:28,380

They put the, instead, instead, they buy these, like, giant
CD holder things.

1142

They buy these giant CD holder, like, contain, not
containers, but, like, those flippy things.

1143
01:56:21,180 --> 01:56:23,320
The TF2 had updates insane.

Anyway.

1162

1169
01:58:34,970 --> 01:58:35,690
Anyway.

1170
01:58:36,270 --> 01:58:36,450
Alright.

Next item on the list.

1173
01:58:39,890 --> 01:58:42,050
Sorry for this random ad there.

01:58:42,370 --> 01:58:43,790
For all you guys.

1175
01:58:44,330 --> 01:58:45,450
The next item.

1176
01:58:45,950 --> 01:58:46,770
It is.

1177
01:58:51,670 --> 01:58:54,230
A dokey themed necklace.

1178
01:58:55,130 --> 01:58:55,470
Alright.

1179
01:58:56,850 --> 01:58:58,010
This is a concept bar.

1180
01:58:58,290 --> 01:59:11,030
but it is also made of sterling silver um this is a joki
themed necklace that has obviously it's like in my colors

1181
01:59:11,030 --> 01:59:16,950
with the gems and everything as well as like the design as
well i remember i picked the con they gave me several

1182
01:59:16,950 --> 01:59:25,450
designs um and i feel like this was the one that best
represented um me and it is by elizabeth uh so really

1183
01:59:25,450 --> 01:59:30,990
beautiful necklace i really loved Like, I really love, like,
the design concept in general.

1184
01:59:31,150 --> 01:59:34,830
They're amazing, and jewelry designer, and it's really
pretty.

1185
01:59:35,030 --> 01:59:36,910
It's gorgeous, honestly.

1186
01:59:37,250 --> 01:59:41,730
Like, honestly, there's not a lot for me to say because it's
just a really beautiful piece.

1187
01:59:42,130 --> 01:59:46,130
And, like I said, it is one-of-a-kind in public circulation.

1188
01:59:47,410 --> 01:59:53,930
I hate that I can't say one-of-a-kind anymore because you
guys are so anal about that.

1189
01:59:58,130 --> 02:00:00,810
Not allowed to say one of a kind.

1190
02:00:02,670 --> 02:00:03,270
Anyway.

1191
02:00:04,750 --> 02:00:05,430
Anyway.

1192
02:00:06,410 --> 02:00:08,030
What is next?

1193
02:00:08,250 --> 02:00:10,130
Ooh, we are three more to go.

1194
02:00:10,910 --> 02:00:12,890
Three more to go.

1195
02:00:15,370 --> 02:00:17,330
Where is this one?

1196
02:00:17,730 --> 02:00:19,990
Where the fuck did I put the concept for this?

1197
02:00:21,230 --> 02:00:23,590
Okay, here we go.

1198
02:00:23,750 --> 02:00:24,650
I think it is.

1199
02:00:25,370 --> 02:00:25,850
This.

1200
02:00:26,430 --> 02:00:26,790
Alright.

1201
02:00:28,370 --> 02:00:33,890
This is a Doki-themed pyrography linking wood.

1202
02:00:34,270 --> 02:00:37,030
So for those who don't, this is by Wormwood Pyro.

1203
02:00:37,610 --> 02:00:48,410
So for those who don't know what pyrography is, it's
basically like flame torched art, which is crazy to think

1204
02:00:48,410 --> 02:00:48,730
about.

1205
02:00:49,230 --> 02:00:57,330
So if you look at their portfolio, I believe my mod, yeah,
my mod has linked their portfolio.

1206
02:00:57,830 --> 02:01:00,490
And you see, like, what they've done in the past and
everything.

1207
02:01:00,930 --> 02:01:04,150
So they're using fire to create art.

1208
02:01:04,530 --> 02:01:07,810
So, like, they draw it on the wood with fire.

1209
02:01:08,710 --> 02:01:11,170
And it's actually, their portfolio is insane.

1210
02:01:11,310 --> 02:01:14,210
It's actually very, very interesting to look at.

1211
02:01:15,310 --> 02:01:17,370
But very gorgeous artwork.

1212
02:01:18,170 --> 02:01:19,970
Indeed, obviously, this concept art.

1213
02:01:20,390 --> 02:01:22,310
But I'm pretty sure it's going to turn out amazing.

1214
02:01:22,510 --> 02:01:24,790
But, yes, it is, like, wood burning type deal.

1215
02:01:27,830 --> 02:01:29,410
Okay, last two guys.

1216
02:01:29,910 --> 02:01:31,170
We're in the final stretch.

1217
02:01:31,790 --> 02:01:33,710

amazing creators that are part of this auction.

1268
02:06:44,770 --> 02:06:47,810

02:06:49,950 --> 02:06:58,550
I'm really sorry if you didn't make it if you weren't able
to be a part of the final round that we chose for it.

1271
02:06:58,950 --> 02:07:04,470
Maybe in the future, because definitely, obviously I won't
do these types of auctions very frequently.

1272
02:07:04,810 --> 02:07:08,250
Like, you know, it's going to lose their spark and their
appeal for charity.

1273
02:07:09,070 --> 02:07:13,310
But maybe it will be something I'll do again maybe next
year.

1274
02:07:14,190 --> 02:07:26,450
Because it was a great pleasure to work with lots of amazing
creators to create these of a kind uh dokeybird items um so

1275
02:07:26,450 --> 02:07:37,250

02:31:14,550 --> 02:31:18,490
If you're not awake and watching, Little Man, I will message
you.

1550
02:31:18,670 --> 02:31:24,170
I don't know who I'm telling this to if you're not watching,
but, like, Like, I need to figure out how to do the merch

1551
02:31:24,170 --> 02:31:26,130
giveaway on stream.

1552
02:31:28,490 --> 02:31:29,370
But I'm...

1553
02:31:29,790 --> 02:31:30,870
Little Man's watching!

1554
02:31:31,170 --> 02:31:34,550
Okay, Little Man, can you help me figure out how to do a
merch giveaway?

1555
02:31:35,070 --> 02:31:35,870
Do we do it on Twitter?

1556
02:31:35,950 --> 02:31:36,790
We could do it on Twitter.

1557
02:31:37,170 --> 02:31:37,810
Okay, wait.

1558
02:31:38,030 --> 02:31:38,370
I...

1559
02:31:38,890 --> 02:31:40,630
We can do the classic!

1560
02:31:41,330 --> 02:31:43,210
Like him or just comment.

1561
02:31:43,870 --> 02:31:45,670
Honestly, you don't have to like him retweet.

1562
02:31:45,750 --> 02:31:46,290
Just comment.

1563
02:31:46,690 --> 02:31:46,970
All right.

1564
02:31:48,250 --> 02:31:53,950
Actually, you should retweet because apparently when doing
Twitter giveaways, It's so fucking hard to...

1565
02:31:53,950 --> 02:31:59,730
It's actually so difficult to, like, to, like, to, like,
grab random...

1566
02:31:59,730 --> 02:32:05,990
Like, usually they look at retweets, like, those, like, bots
that does, like, Twitter giveaway pickers, like, where they

1567
02:32:05,990 --> 02:32:06,750
pick the people.

1568
02:32:07,350 --> 02:32:07,950
Please.

1569
02:32:09,770 --> 02:32:12,210
I will kick you out of my room.

1570
02:32:16,650 --> 02:32:17,750
But then, oh, man.

1571
02:32:18,290 --> 02:32:20,190
Help me figure out what's the best way.

1572
02:32:20,430 --> 02:32:21,610

Justice for dad.

1607
02:34:25,900 --> 02:34:30,920
Bro, the moment I, like, picked him up, he, like, tried to,
like, go for the chicken.

1608
02:34:31,060 --> 02:34:33,860
He's like, oh, my God, I'm taller now.

I believe it will be done around maybe mid-March or end of
March.

1762
02:49:11,320 --> 02:49:13,760
It really depends on the animator.

1763
02:49:14,040 --> 02:49:16,280
Um, I love working with this animator.

1764
02:49:16,580 --> 02:49:20,700
Um, I've been working with them since for like three, four
years, I think.

1765
02:49:20,980 --> 02:49:22,460
I've always loved their work.

1766
02:49:23,800 --> 02:49:33,720
to be able to keep working with them and to make a new intro
honestly my favorite part is like the dancing the dancing

in the future it's definitely gonna get updated whenever i

1775
02:50:51,080 --> 02:51:02,380
do getting new has like blocked off a day a month a general
month to like rework on it later on in the future to update

1776
02:51:02,380 --> 02:51:09,660
it to update it if needed so it might not be the one version
of the intro there's going to be more versions of this intro

1777
02:51:09,660 --> 02:51:17,660
in the future so something else to look forward to so it
might not be like I whenever I do get the updated skin suit

1778
02:51:17,660 --> 02:51:27,120
it the intro is going to look different um but for now it's
based off my current skin suit yeah like i'll still be using

1779
02:51:27,120 --> 02:51:34,160
oh it will be basing it off of my current skin suit for now
and then she she's gonna edit it to update it in the future

1780
02:51:34,160 --> 02:51:44,800
so yes that is i don't know let me see if there's anything
else i can legally show you

1781
02:51:49,880 --> 02:52:01,440
Let me double check if there's anything else that I can, um,
I mean, I've talked about this before, but the next big

1782
02:52:01,440 --> 02:52:10,320
event slash project that I'll be working on after, I think I
talked about in general, but like I never said it

1783
02:52:10,320 --> 02:52:19,140
officially, but the next official project that I'll be
working on, um, that I've been in talks with Mr. Man.

1784
02:52:19,180 --> 02:52:26,980
about this um is going to be like this the next event i'm
planning on because this is like more so of a small scale

1785
02:52:26,980 --> 02:52:35,160
you know like the the hardest part of doing all this was the
auction in general but the next event that i'll be hosting

1786
02:52:35,160 --> 02:52:53,240
um after this will be the uh vtuber w w uh sorry not w no

So it's all still being planned and everything.

1789
02:53:01,020 --> 02:53:06,200
Like it's being like brainstormed at the moment on the
logistics of everything that's going to be going on.

1790
02:53:06,860 --> 02:53:13,960
But the next big event I'm planning on will be VTuber slash
wrestling event.

wondering what it's gonna be like so it's sort of like

wwe-esque so like it's like wrestlemania type deal uh uh so
it's gonna be like similar to that but for vtubers uh and

03:00:37,470 --> 03:00:38,570
It's like, okay.

1864
03:00:38,890 --> 03:00:46,110
There's like this famous Animal Crossing boobab mouse pad,
but instead of tomato, it's like the Animal Crossing fruits,

1865
03:00:46,190 --> 03:00:48,490
and that's like what I'm thinking of right now.

1866
03:00:48,770 --> 03:00:51,030
That's actually what I'm thinking of.

1867
03:00:51,590 --> 03:00:51,870
Okay.

1868
03:00:53,090 --> 03:00:54,150
Alright, let's see.

1869
03:00:54,610 --> 03:00:57,270
The requested item in the tomato theme.

1870
03:00:57,370 --> 03:00:58,070
Alright, let me see.

1871
03:00:58,390 --> 03:00:59,810
I'm gonna see if I can pull it up.

1872
03:00:59,950 --> 03:01:01,570
Animal Crossing.

1873
03:01:03,550 --> 03:01:05,830
Oh my god, this is so... It's gonna be so cursed.

1874
03:01:06,210 --> 03:01:09,590
This is gonna be so bad if it doesn't show up the one that I
expected.

1875
03:01:09,990 --> 03:01:10,210
Oh yeah.

1876
03:01:12,290 --> 03:01:13,270
It's so bad.

1877
03:01:13,450 --> 03:01:14,270
Oh, it's this one.

1878
03:01:14,670 --> 03:01:18,110
I think I actually, I think I almost bought this one.

1879
03:01:18,430 --> 03:01:22,130
I'm pretty sure I almost bought it because I was like, oh my
god, this is so cute.

1880
03:01:24,130 --> 03:01:25,050
But it's this.

1881
03:01:25,150 --> 03:01:25,950
Let me show you guys.

1882
03:01:26,330 --> 03:01:26,910
It's this.

1883
03:01:27,210 --> 03:01:29,810
So it'll be like this, but tomatoes instead.

1884
03:01:31,370 --> 03:01:33,810
Like, it's like, it's so cute though.

1885
03:01:33,970 --> 03:01:35,170
It's so cute.

1886
03:01:39,150 --> 03:01:41,990
I actually, I almost ordered.

1887
03:01:42,010 --> 03:01:45,930
this because I was so... The thing is, I would never use it.

1888
03:01:46,030 --> 03:01:48,610
I would never use it because I have a gamer mouse pad.

1889
03:01:48,990 --> 03:01:50,250
But like, it's so cute.

1890
03:01:50,410 --> 03:01:53,410
But instead of the fruits, it's the tomatoes.

1891
03:01:54,010 --> 03:01:55,410
But only if it wins, of course.

1892
03:01:55,930 --> 03:01:57,830
It's only if it wins, guys.

1893
03:01:58,110 --> 03:02:01,130
If you're like, guys, please, we could have tomatoes!

1894
03:02:01,670 --> 03:02:02,150
Please!

1895
03:02:05,890 --> 03:02:09,510
It's hard to vote for it because there's so many choices.

1896
03:02:10,210 --> 03:02:17,890
There's so many choices, but only one can win chat only only
one can win and then the rest would be like only there can

1897
03:02:17,890 --> 03:02:23,930
only be one super high production item because like i can't
afford to make several super high production

1980
03:09:29,160 --> 03:09:30,600
Like, this is a cherry stream.

1981
03:09:30,740 --> 03:09:31,640
What if they claim it?

1982
03:09:32,160 --> 03:09:34,040
I just realized, wait, this is a charity stream.

1983
03:09:34,160 --> 03:09:36,220
I don't give a fuck if they claim this.

1984
03:09:40,480 --> 03:09:41,640
I almost forgot.

1985
03:09:42,060 --> 03:09:43,580
I was doing this for charity.

1986
03:09:43,960 --> 03:09:45,660
I was thinking about content.

1987
03:09:45,780 --> 03:09:47,540
I was thinking about...

1988
03:09:47,540 --> 03:09:47,940

03:09:52,940 --> 03:09:54,280
As long as it's not blocked.

1993
03:09:55,000 --> 03:09:55,840
Is this song good?

1994
03:09:56,800 --> 03:09:58,800

1995
03:10:00,060 --> 03:10:00,700

I can smell the pepper!

2033
03:13:38,510 --> 03:13:39,090
It's like...

2034
03:13:39,090 --> 03:13:41,570
It's like 30 centimeters away from you.

2035
03:13:41,610 --> 03:13:42,570
I still smell the pepper.

2036
03:13:43,110 --> 03:13:43,550
Okay, maybe.

2037
03:13:43,570 --> 03:13:46,210
30, 20, 27 years away from me, and I still smell it.

2038
03:13:46,890 --> 03:13:46,890
Okay.

2039
03:13:48,670 --> 03:13:52,350

Oh, oh, okay.

2060
03:16:07,920 --> 03:16:10,000
It actually tasted nice, though.

2061
03:16:19,340 --> 03:16:25,800
Other than it being extremely spicy, oh my god, it's still
burning.

2062
03:16:26,560 --> 03:16:27,340
It's still burning.

2063
03:16:29,720 --> 03:16:31,360
Oh, I was saying.

2064
03:16:31,500 --> 03:16:56,580
It's very spicy It's like I still feel the spice On my
tongue I still feel it But there's flavor Fuck okay Oh It's

2065
03:16:56,580 --> 03:17:04,240
better than the bomb It's actually It's It, like, it has

03:17:07,340 --> 03:17:07,380
Oh.

03:17:09,060 --> 03:17:10,460
But it's, oh my gosh.

2069
03:17:10,820 --> 03:17:12,560

03:17:16,600 --> 03:17:17,160
Oh my gosh.

2072
03:17:17,820 --> 03:17:18,840
It's very, oh my gosh.

2073
03:17:18,900 --> 03:17:19,860
I can feel it in my cheeks.

2074
03:17:19,960 --> 03:17:20,580
What the fuck?

2075
03:17:20,900 --> 03:17:22,240
What's wrong with this pepper sauce?

2076
03:17:24,460 --> 03:17:24,800
Okay.

2077
03:17:27,940 --> 03:17:29,420
It's very spicy.

2078
03:17:30,860 --> 03:17:46,180
but it actually has a nice taste will I do it again honestly
honestly if I have I don't have enough milk I literally only

2079
03:17:46,180 --> 03:17:55,080
have like two I like my milk is like barely done I only have
like one more sip of milk left

2080
03:17:59,780 --> 03:18:04,440
oh but oh my Oh my god, it's like pinching my cheeks.

2081
03:18:05,400 --> 03:18:08,640
I like feel like the pinch on my cheeks.

2082
03:18:09,360 --> 03:18:10,100
Oh my god.

2083
03:18:11,720 --> 03:18:12,880
It's like...

2084
03:18:12,880 --> 03:18:13,380
I don't know.

2085
03:18:13,540 --> 03:18:16,460
Okay, it's like those spice that builds up.

2086
03:18:16,800 --> 03:18:17,860
It builds up.

2087
03:18:17,980 --> 03:18:19,420
And it's like pinching.

2088
03:18:19,960 --> 03:18:21,260
It's like pinching.

2089
03:18:21,540 --> 03:18:28,260
I feel like if you don't have the spice tolerance like me,
you're so fucked.

2090
03:18:28,420 --> 03:18:29,000
Yeah.

2091
03:18:32,000 --> 03:18:36,120
Like I wouldn't say like, oh my god, I'm gonna fucking die.

2092
03:18:36,200 --> 03:18:37,600
That's so fucking spicy.

2093
03:18:37,840 --> 03:18:51,140
I wouldn't say that I would say that I think it's very spicy
But it's not like I'm gonna fucking die So if you don't have

2094
03:18:51,140 --> 03:18:59,320
my spice tolerance You're so fucked like because even I was
like damn that like I could feel like the pinching on my

2095
03:18:59,320 --> 03:19:08,700
cheeks um it's definitely not going to be doing very well in
my stomach like at least i'm not like mixing all of it like

2096
03:19:08,700 --> 03:19:19,980
last time that one was bad that was very bad but i would
definitely say um i grew up with spicy things so i live but

2097
03:19:19,980 --> 03:19:26,360
like if you don't grow up with spice i i don't know what to
say i think you'd be pretty fucked anyway i'm gonna eat my

2098
03:19:26,360 --> 03:19:27,500
chicken we'll know i'm gonna eat

2099
03:19:38,950 --> 03:19:40,290
I deserve this.

2100
03:19:40,770 --> 03:19:42,530
I deserve my chicken.

2101
03:19:43,470 --> 03:19:43,730
Alright.

2102
03:19:46,690 --> 03:19:47,330
Now, of course.

2103
03:19:48,190 --> 03:19:50,430
It's a non-sauce chicken.

2104
03:19:51,770 --> 03:19:53,470
I deserve more chicken.

2105
03:19:54,170 --> 03:19:55,770
But, like, not the spicy one.

2106
03:19:57,070 --> 03:19:57,830
Oh, my God.

2107
03:19:57,910 --> 03:19:59,090
My eyes are watering, though.

2108
03:19:59,730 --> 03:20:00,270
Holy shit.

2109
03:20:00,990 --> 03:20:05,110
I feel like it's not as fun when I have, like, the Asian
face tolerance, though.

2110
03:20:11,910 --> 03:20:19,910
I have the Asian spice tolerance So like Oh shit Give me a
sec guys I need to wash my hands I need to make sure Don't

2111
03:20:19,910 --> 03:20:21,370
touch my eyes Give me a sec

2112
03:21:02,180 --> 03:21:12,900
Alright I'm back Alright Alright like I said Fuck the bomb
ha sauce That shit tasted like metal Like I don't understand

2113
03:21:12,900 --> 03:21:23,380
They can make perfectly reasonable sauce, hot sauce, that
actually tastes like something, like, tastes like something

2114
03:21:23,380 --> 03:21:23,820
good.

2115
03:21:24,300 --> 03:21:27,200
But then they made the bomb, which is just metal.

2116
03:21:27,720 --> 03:21:30,000
It just actually tastes metal.

2117
03:21:30,700 --> 03:21:33,040
Like, the bomb was so fucking bad.

2118
03:21:33,280 --> 03:21:33,740
Holy shit.

2119
03:21:34,000 --> 03:21:39,620
But this one's, like, actually, it's, if it wasn't so
fucking hot, I would try it again.

2120
03:21:39,740 --> 03:21:41,520
I would try, what is it called?

2121
03:21:42,340 --> 03:21:53,160
I would try the last stab experience if it didn't if it
wasn't like i mean okay to be fair if i had another if i had

2122
03:21:53,160 --> 03:22:04,520
more milk if i had more milk i will actually do another bite
i'll do another chicken for it but like i barely have enough

2123
03:22:04,520 --> 03:22:08,720
milk for this so it's not worth it it's not it's not worth
it

2124
03:22:12,010 --> 03:22:19,490
so like i wouldn't i wouldn't fucking i wouldn't i would not
like push that boundary all right what's the next stretch

2125
03:22:19,490 --> 03:22:31,490
goal what is it um like i i haven't played a single game
i've just been i hope you guys have been entertained despite

2126
03:22:31,490 --> 03:22:36,570
the many non-skippable ads i i hope you guys have been

2127
03:22:42,030 --> 03:22:51,890
Okay, okay, let's see, what's the next one that is, okay,
um, do I cover with you son?

2128
03:22:52,710 --> 03:22:57,310
So, um, you son is totally down to do it.

2129
03:22:57,750 --> 03:23:03,030
Um, they were actually at first down to do it without the
charity, and then I was like, no, let's do it for charity,

2130
03:23:03,170 --> 03:23:05,650
because like, you know, it's a, it's a good cause.

2131
03:23:05,990 --> 03:23:17,830
Um, let me read, um, okay, so basically, um, the duet cover
with yusun you guys get to decide what song um we can do

2132
03:23:17,830 --> 03:23:27,630
together um and uh yusun will be in charge with uh getting
the mixers and the instrumentals and then i will be in

2133
03:23:27,630 --> 03:23:37,250
charge of finding the artist and the mv editor i will be
funding i will be funding the entire video uh but uh but

2134
03:23:37,250 --> 03:23:44,810
we're like splitting the job so like i would still be paying
for instrumentals and mixers um but um but like islam will

2135
03:23:44,810 --> 03:23:50,110
be in charge of finding them because like you know they are
a singer and they're much more experienced with that type of

2136
03:23:50,110 --> 03:24:04,370
thing um so we will decide on um where you guys get to pick
uh what duet cover we will do together um i will say if you

2137
03:24:04,370 --> 03:24:08,910
know um i guys okay this is very off topic but one of my
favorite

2138
03:24:14,110 --> 03:24:24,570
This is super off topic, but I don't know if you guys know
this, but one of my favorite songs is, Deaf Should Not Have

2139
03:24:24,570 --> 03:24:26,090

2140
03:24:28,250 --> 03:24:28,950
Fun...

2141
03:24:33,790 --> 03:24:36,110
It's just so off topic, guys.

2142
03:24:36,570 --> 03:24:40,070
It's so off topic, but I like to say...

2143
03:24:40,090 --> 03:24:57,630
that um death should not have taken thee is honestly one of
my favorite um uh duet songs out there but obviously this

2144
03:24:57,630 --> 03:25:06,450
has nothing to do with like the cover with with yusam but i
love you know wonderful opportunity is like one of my

2145
03:25:06,450 --> 03:25:22,350
favorite like jp uh uh Vocaloid artists and oh my god
hearing like uh all I'm saying is that oh my god like you

2146
03:25:22,350 --> 03:25:27,150

2147
03:25:31,110 --> 03:25:38,050
and like oh it's just such a good song though right

2148
03:25:41,650 --> 03:25:45,290
Got someone be like, that would be great for a second cover,
you know?

2149
03:25:45,370 --> 03:25:47,210
That would be great.

2150
03:25:50,410 --> 03:25:53,650
So I was like, oh yeah, like for your second cover, right?

2151
03:25:53,790 --> 03:25:55,090
Like, wow, yeah.

2152
03:25:59,510 --> 03:26:02,090
I just, I'm just saying, I'm just saying.

2153
03:26:02,770 --> 03:26:04,190
It's so off topic, anyway.

2154
03:26:04,610 --> 03:26:08,570
Anyway, as I, anyway, it's super off topic, though.

2155
03:26:09,170 --> 03:26:15,790
But like, what, what, what are your, what are your, What
song do you guys want what you son and I to what song do you

yes, yeah.

2159
03:26:27,690 --> 03:26:30,130
What suggestions do you guys have?

2160
03:26:30,590 --> 03:26:35,470
Okay, we cannot do free bird because they already
demonetized me the first time.

2161
03:26:35,970 --> 03:26:38,130
So I refuse to do free bird.

2162
03:26:41,650 --> 03:26:52,410
bird has generated enough revenue off of my first stream
back like they have i will veto free bird just because

2163
03:26:52,410 --> 03:26:56,370
they've already generated enough income from that stream

2164
03:26:59,850 --> 03:27:10,210
so i i will veto free bird because of it um i heard rokey
rokey's a nice song i think rokey's a great song too for uh

2165
03:27:10,210 --> 03:27:18,870
uh for a cover um all right rokey what are what other
suggestions do you guys have we will have a poll with four

2166
03:27:18,870 --> 03:27:32,090
choices just like last time and then you guys can vote uh
for the one you guys want to hear the most um oh my god why

2167
03:27:32,090 --> 03:27:35,350
are you guys suggesting like the fucking hardest song is
that I would never be able to sing.

2168
03:27:36,850 --> 03:27:40,190
Like, guys, you saw what sound amazing.

2169
03:27:41,550 --> 03:27:45,730
But you guys have to remember, I am also singing it.

Like, I am also singing it.

2171
03:27:50,210 --> 03:27:52,490
Like, the, what was it?

2239
03:33:51,620 --> 03:33:53,400
Son, it would be...

2240
03:33:53,400 --> 03:33:54,880

2241
03:33:55,080 --> 03:33:55,360
Okay.

2242
03:33:59,860 --> 03:34:02,260

Yeah, remember my password real quick, guys.

2517
03:56:37,050 --> 03:56:37,410
Alright.

2518
03:56:37,670 --> 03:56:38,050
It's okay.

2519
03:56:38,150 --> 03:56:38,590
Thank God.

2520
03:56:38,610 --> 03:56:40,670
for a password manager.

2521
03:56:41,710 --> 03:56:41,910
Thank God.

2522
03:56:44,550 --> 03:56:45,010
Alright.

2523
03:56:45,750 --> 03:56:46,710
Oh my god.

2524
03:56:47,870 --> 03:56:50,790
That would be very unfortunate if you guys had a password
for that.

2525
03:56:50,890 --> 03:56:52,950
That would be so unfortunate.

2526
03:56:53,990 --> 03:56:54,310
Alright.

2527
03:56:56,030 --> 03:57:00,330
I'm gonna be the best forklift operator out there.

2528
03:57:01,510 --> 03:57:02,490
And then...

2529
03:57:02,490 --> 03:57:04,770
And then I'll take an actual test.

2530
03:57:05,250 --> 03:57:07,970
I need to know for sure if I'm good at this.

2531
03:57:08,610 --> 03:57:13,330
Okay, guys, like, I need to know for sure that this is, that
I would pass.

2532
03:57:13,490 --> 03:57:21,010
If I do it now, if I do it now, I'll be, like, prepared for
the actual written test.

2533
03:57:22,530 --> 03:57:23,230
Okay, let me down.

2534
03:57:23,490 --> 03:57:24,550
I need to down.

2535
03:57:24,650 --> 03:57:25,790
Did I not buy it?

2536
03:57:26,830 --> 03:57:27,590
Oh, my God.

2537
03:57:27,690 --> 03:57:28,210
Did I forget?

2538
03:57:28,410 --> 03:57:28,930
Oh, my God.

2539
03:57:28,990 --> 03:57:30,190
I fucking forgot to buy.

2540
03:57:30,490 --> 03:57:32,070
Are you fucking kidding me?

2541
03:57:32,590 --> 03:57:33,210
Oh, yeah, okay.

2542
03:57:33,290 --> 03:57:34,350
Agree and pay.

2543
03:57:35,330 --> 03:57:36,510
We're doing it live.

2544
03:57:36,630 --> 03:57:38,590
I forgot to agree to the terms of service.

2545
03:57:38,610 --> 03:57:40,570
So I never bought it.

2546
03:57:40,630 --> 03:57:45,190
I never bought it because I forgot to create the terms of
service.

2547
03:57:45,750 --> 03:57:45,990
All right.

2548
03:57:46,590 --> 03:57:47,270
Install content.

2549
03:57:47,990 --> 03:57:48,270
Nice.

2550
03:57:48,650 --> 03:57:50,030
It's a gigabyte.

2551
03:57:50,130 --> 03:57:50,830
Holy fuck.

2552
03:57:51,070 --> 03:57:53,590
Why the fuck is the forklift operator?

2553
03:57:54,230 --> 03:57:55,330
Eight gigabytes.

2554
03:57:57,130 --> 03:57:58,910
What is in there?

2555
03:57:59,390 --> 03:58:00,750
Are they Bitcoin mining?

2556
03:58:01,690 --> 03:58:01,970
All right.

2557
03:58:02,070 --> 03:58:03,770
Let me go to solo gaming real fast.

2558
03:58:04,270 --> 03:58:05,050
Solo gaming.

2559
03:58:06,870 --> 03:58:07,230
Boop.

2560
03:58:07,390 --> 03:58:07,750
All right.

2561
03:58:08,610 --> 03:58:09,610
There we go.

2562
03:58:10,650 --> 03:58:11,450
I can't believe.

2563
03:58:13,470 --> 03:58:13,970
Forklift simulator.

2564
03:58:14,150 --> 03:58:18,810
Okay, but forklift simulator 2023 has terrible reviews.

2565
03:58:19,130 --> 03:58:21,530
We need to be properly trained.

2566
03:58:22,010 --> 03:58:23,690
We can't cheese the system.

2567
03:58:24,150 --> 03:58:30,090
Because when I said, why can't I just pay to have, why can't
I just pay to get the degree?

2568
03:58:30,250 --> 03:58:31,250
People were like, no.

2569
03:58:31,810 --> 03:58:34,690
Forklifting is serious business, guys.

2570
03:58:34,990 --> 03:58:38,590
So of course, because it's serious business, of course I
wouldn't try.

2571
03:58:38,610 --> 03:58:51,190
and do i will pay for the most expensive one is this not
what you wanted you guys were like whoa you can't cheap out

2572
03:58:51,190 --> 03:58:58,190

2573
03:59:02,930 --> 03:59:11,810
all right here we go You're gonna watch me be the best
forklift operator out there for charity.

2574
03:59:12,190 --> 03:59:14,350
This is my content now.

2575
03:59:16,570 --> 03:59:16,610
Gaming.

2576
03:59:16,850 --> 03:59:18,030
It's not WillQuest.

2577
03:59:18,670 --> 03:59:20,530
It's forklift operator.

2578
03:59:21,790 --> 03:59:23,030
There's a leaderboard?

2579
03:59:24,010 --> 03:59:29,850
Why is there a leaderboard for this?

2580
03:59:30,650 --> 03:59:31,630
Who's gonna...

2581
03:59:31,630 --> 03:59:33,990
There's gonna be someone better than me?

2582
03:59:37,430 --> 03:59:39,010
Do you want to play it?

2583
03:59:39,950 --> 03:59:39,950
Sure.

2584
03:59:42,150 --> 03:59:44,170
Welcome to the tutorial mode.

2585
03:59:44,810 --> 03:59:49,470
Before you become the best forklift operator, you have to
know how to steer a forklift.

2586
03:59:50,330 --> 03:59:51,970
Let's learn the basis of forklifted.

2587
03:59:52,050 --> 03:59:53,010
Driving in...

2588
03:59:53,010 --> 03:59:53,290
Alright.

2589
03:59:55,930 --> 03:59:56,930
What is this?

2590
03:59:57,150 --> 03:59:57,810
What is square?

2591
03:59:58,630 --> 03:59:59,590
What is...

2592
03:59:59,590 --> 04:00:00,790
This is mouse and keyboard.

2593
04:00:01,310 --> 04:00:02,450
Why is this?

2594
04:00:03,170 --> 04:00:03,710
No.

2595
04:00:03,990 --> 04:00:04,350
Please.

2596
04:00:04,650 --> 04:00:05,570
Why is this not?

2597
04:00:05,730 --> 04:00:07,410
Why is this not mouse and keyboard?

2598
04:00:08,250 --> 04:00:08,970
What is square?

2599
04:00:09,890 --> 04:00:10,290
Oh, okay.

2600
04:00:10,470 --> 04:00:12,350
Be careful and control your current progress.

2601
04:00:13,990 --> 04:00:16,930
Next to press it, can you add number of crashes?

2602
04:00:17,290 --> 04:00:22,090
In carrier mode, on the right, you can find information
about earned money.

2603
04:00:22,270 --> 04:00:23,850
If you need a break, just pause the game.

2604
04:00:23,970 --> 04:00:25,410
What is lines?

2605
04:00:26,790 --> 04:00:27,710
What's a line?

2606
04:00:29,330 --> 04:00:32,370
Go straight ahead using if you need to stop, press X.

2607
04:00:32,530 --> 04:00:33,030
What is X?

2608
04:00:33,490 --> 04:00:33,650
What?

2609
04:00:34,190 --> 04:00:35,470
What is that?

2610
04:00:36,690 --> 04:00:38,090
We're forklifting, guys.

2611
04:00:38,250 --> 04:00:39,030
This is serious.

2612
04:00:39,790 --> 04:00:41,650
Okay, I'm gonna...

2613
04:00:41,650 --> 04:00:42,230
Ow, okay.

2614
04:00:42,590 --> 04:00:42,950
It's okay.

2615
04:00:43,010 --> 04:00:44,270
I didn't hurt too much.

2616
04:00:45,870 --> 04:00:46,250
Alright, wait.

2617
04:00:46,290 --> 04:00:47,990
Do I need to drive in the straight line?

2618
04:00:48,050 --> 04:00:49,430
Can I just...

2619
04:00:49,430 --> 04:00:50,210
Oh, it doesn't matter.

2620
04:00:50,310 --> 04:00:51,030
I don't get penalties.

2621
04:00:51,210 --> 04:00:51,410
Okay.

2622
04:00:52,150 --> 04:00:52,490
Alright.

2623
04:00:53,610 --> 04:00:55,130
Alright, I'm gonna lower...

2624
04:00:55,130 --> 04:00:56,370
I'm gonna lower this.

2625
04:00:56,910 --> 04:00:57,770
How do I reverse?

2626
04:00:58,550 --> 04:00:59,550
I can't reverse.

2627
04:01:01,130 --> 04:01:02,050
Okay, don't...

2628
04:01:02,050 --> 04:01:03,970
My PlayStation isn't plugged in!

2629
04:01:03,990 --> 04:01:05,630
How do I reverse?

2630
04:01:06,290 --> 04:01:07,230
How do I reverse?

2631
04:01:11,830 --> 04:01:13,510
I can't lower it.

2632
04:01:13,710 --> 04:01:14,310
This is as low.

2633
04:01:14,610 --> 04:01:14,930
Guys.

2634
04:01:15,490 --> 04:01:15,710
Guys.

2635
04:01:16,010 --> 04:01:16,330
I don't know.

2636
04:01:16,410 --> 04:01:19,810
I don't think I'm going to be the best forklift operator out
there.

2637
04:01:20,010 --> 04:01:21,890
I have a feeling.

2638

I have.

2639
04:01:26,790 --> 04:01:28,090

I figured it out!

2665
04:03:56,670 --> 04:03:57,170
It's okay.

2666
04:03:58,170 --> 04:04:00,170
We don't need to follow this anymore.

2667
04:04:02,610 --> 04:04:03,090
Use...

2668
04:04:03,090 --> 04:04:04,930
Okay, we need to do that.

2669
04:04:05,110 --> 04:04:05,810
And then...

2670
04:04:06,810 --> 04:04:07,490
No.

2671
04:04:08,370 --> 04:04:08,870
No.

2672
04:04:10,410 --> 04:04:11,090
No.

2673
04:04:12,470 --> 04:04:13,450
Come on, Doki.

2674
04:04:14,130 --> 04:04:16,150
You gotta pass that test, Doki.

2675
04:04:16,850 --> 04:04:17,590

04:04:18,390 --> 04:04:19,810

2682
04:04:30,210 --> 04:04:31,610
Oh my god!

2683
04:04:36,940 --> 04:04:38,340
Oh my god!

2684
04:04:39,120 --> 04:04:41,040
Worklift certification is so easy.

2685
04:04:41,880 --> 04:04:42,800
Oh my god.

2686
04:04:42,940 --> 04:04:45,400
Why do you need a license for this?

2687
04:04:45,780 --> 04:04:47,720
A child can do it.

2688
04:04:48,200 --> 04:04:48,420
Ow.

2689
04:04:48,660 --> 04:04:48,880
Okay.

2690
04:04:49,460 --> 04:04:49,960
It's okay.

2691
04:04:50,060 --> 04:04:50,680
It doesn't matter.

2692
04:04:50,940 --> 04:04:52,500
They're not that expensive anyway.

2693
04:04:53,500 --> 04:04:53,560
Okay.

2694
04:04:53,880 --> 04:04:55,940
To better support the pallets.

2695
04:04:56,180 --> 04:04:57,080
So supported already.

Okay.

2697
04:04:57,800 --> 04:04:59,420

Okay.

2699
04:05:00,300 --> 04:05:01,480

04:05:02,720 --> 04:05:03,080
Alright.

2701
04:05:03,300 --> 04:05:04,800
And then we go forward.

Okay.

2704
04:05:08,580 --> 04:05:09,100

Leave!

2709
04:05:52,960 --> 04:05:54,400
Why is it gravity?

2710
04:05:54,600 --> 04:05:55,960
Why is it gravity working?

2711
04:05:58,880 --> 04:05:59,520

04:06:59,400 --> 04:07:01,600
I think the tutorial has taught me enough.

2725
04:07:02,440 --> 04:07:02,660
Honestly.

2726
04:07:02,820 --> 04:07:04,360

ready for grudge if i successfully get 500 um with only five

2728
04:07:21,840 --> 04:07:29,520
within eight minutes then i'm forklift certified i will
actually take a test for forklift certification though i

2729
04:07:29,520 --> 04:07:37,780
would actually do it but like But, like, I have to play this
game first to see my potential.

2730
04:07:39,140 --> 04:07:39,340
Okay.

2731
04:07:40,680 --> 04:07:41,520

Come on.

2734
04:07:45,220 --> 04:07:46,520
Okay, we'll reverse.

2735
04:07:47,340 --> 04:07:48,060
And then...

2736
04:07:48,820 --> 04:07:50,400
We'll put it all the way down.

2737
04:07:51,520 --> 04:07:53,020
And then stick it in the hole.

2738
04:07:53,660 --> 04:07:54,380
Stick it in the hole.

2739
04:07:54,600 --> 04:07:55,560
Why aren't you...

Is it here?

2758
04:08:32,160 --> 04:08:33,600
Do I take it outside?

2759
04:08:35,060 --> 04:08:37,240
Oh, this wasn't the thing I was supposed to do.

2760
04:08:38,180 --> 04:08:39,660

That's okay.

2770
04:08:50,360 --> 04:08:52,100
This wasn't the original item.

04:08:52,540 --> 04:08:53,500
The item's outside.

2787
04:10:19,610 --> 04:10:20,530

Why?

2803
04:10:49,110 --> 04:10:49,950
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

2804
04:10:50,430 --> 04:10:50,690
All right.

04:10:52,970 --> 04:10:53,590
There we go.

2806
04:10:53,990 --> 04:10:54,330
No.

2807
04:10:54,890 --> 04:10:55,410
No.

2808
04:10:55,690 --> 04:10:56,890
It's underneath!

2809
04:10:57,290 --> 04:10:58,950
What else do you want from me?

2810
04:10:59,430 --> 04:11:00,070
Okay.

2811
04:11:00,670 --> 04:11:02,870
Okay, I'm slowly dragging it.

2812
04:11:03,530 --> 04:11:03,910
All right.

2813
04:11:04,250 --> 04:11:05,550
And we go forward.

2814
04:11:06,650 --> 04:11:07,310
Oh, wait, wait.

2815
04:11:07,450 --> 04:11:07,790
It's up.

2816
04:11:07,990 --> 04:11:08,470
It's up.

2817
04:11:11,430 --> 04:11:11,790
Oh, my God.

2818
04:11:11,890 --> 04:11:12,690
I'm holding it.

2819
04:11:13,290 --> 04:11:13,630
Oh, fuck.

2820
04:11:13,950 --> 04:11:13,950
Okay.

2821
04:11:14,930 --> 04:11:16,310
I'm trying to...

2822
04:11:16,310 --> 04:11:18,530
I'm looking at my real...

2823
04:11:19,630 --> 04:11:20,630
Rear view mirror!

2824
04:11:21,610 --> 04:11:22,070
Okay.

2825
04:11:22,930 --> 04:11:24,210
My rear view mirror.

2826
04:11:24,450 --> 04:11:25,310
Why am I not there?

2827
04:11:26,170 --> 04:11:27,190
Why am I not there?

2828
04:11:27,330 --> 04:11:27,510
Okay.

2829
04:11:28,410 --> 04:11:28,830
All right.

2830
04:11:30,730 --> 04:11:31,570
Here we go.

2831
04:11:32,670 --> 04:11:33,830
Oh, no.

2832
04:11:34,330 --> 04:11:34,970
It's okay.

2833
04:11:35,090 --> 04:11:36,710
We haven't had any collision.

2834
04:11:38,710 --> 04:11:41,870
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

2835
04:11:42,410 --> 04:11:43,150
All right, that's okay.

2836
04:11:43,330 --> 04:11:43,870
One is fine.

2837
04:11:44,030 --> 04:11:44,890
One collision is fine.

2838
04:11:44,950 --> 04:11:45,710
We're not perfect.

2839
04:11:46,370 --> 04:11:47,190
All right, here we go.

2840
04:11:48,270 --> 04:11:51,430
And then we put it over there.

2841
04:11:52,550 --> 04:11:56,090
Why is there this one box blocking my way?

2842
04:11:57,330 --> 04:11:58,490
Get out.

2843
04:12:00,680 --> 04:12:03,270

I was at this, um, uh

2849
04:13:31,880 --> 04:13:47,260
Guys, I think like after seeing how good I was at, at, you
know, online, I feel like online with the ability of we're

2850
04:13:47,260 --> 04:13:58,360
so we're so locked in honestly like judging by like my
hand-eye coordination online with forklifts like I feel like

2851
04:13:58,360 --> 04:14:09,660
I honestly feel like if I took the test right now I could I
I could easily get forklift certified

2852
04:14:15,500 --> 04:14:29,880
I am I am like 100% so fucking confident that like judging
from like the simulation there is no way I could fail the

2853
04:14:29,880 --> 04:14:34,440
test like I feel like I felt like I was a fucking prodigy

2854
04:14:38,220 --> 04:14:44,420
I don't know about you But I felt like a fucking prodigy.

2855
04:14:57,160 --> 04:14:58,760
Sorry, I did not eat some chicken.

2856
04:14:59,500 --> 04:15:00,740
I had to...

2857
04:15:00,740 --> 04:15:02,360
Not because of the forklift.

2858
04:15:03,400 --> 04:15:04,740
That stress ate, guys.

2859
04:15:05,300 --> 04:15:05,640
Guys.

2860
04:15:06,560 --> 04:15:08,040
Just want you guys to know.

2861
04:15:09,440 --> 04:15:13,920
I was not stress eating because of the forklift.

2862
04:15:15,940 --> 04:15:16,880
I was just...

2863
04:15:16,880 --> 04:15:19,140
I was just very hungry.

2864
04:15:19,540 --> 04:15:20,760
Okay, it has no...

2865
04:15:20,780 --> 04:15:21,680
Correlation.

2866
04:15:22,220 --> 04:15:27,040
Guys, there was no correlation between me eating the chicken

2867
04:15:30,420 --> 04:15:32,740
and operating the fork lip.

2868
04:15:33,740 --> 04:15:34,940
No correlation at all.

2869
04:15:45,680 --> 04:15:46,900
I feel like...

2870
04:15:49,270 --> 04:15:51,630
I feel like I can do it.

2871
04:15:51,870 --> 04:15:56,790
I feel like after seeing my progress and operating that,
it's not that difficult.

2872
04:15:56,870 --> 04:16:00,990
It's like driving a car, which I haven't drove in like 10
years, but it's like driving a car.

2873
04:16:03,270 --> 04:16:10,670
I haven't touched a car in 10 years like you know behind the
driver's seat but I'm pretty sure it's like riding a bicycle

2874
04:16:10,670 --> 04:16:16,670
which I also haven't ridden in 20 years but it's like
walking

2875
04:16:25,850 --> 04:16:37,710
so handling a forklift it's almost as an equivalent to
walking i can feel it honestly it's gonna be so easy it's

2876
04:16:37,710 --> 04:16:49,750
gonna be so easy there's nothing to worry about there's
absolutely nothing to worry about i don't know why you guys

2877
04:16:49,750 --> 04:17:07,470
are are freaking out right now it's so simple let's check on
the auction real quick guys please don't judge me here this

2878
04:17:07,470 --> 04:17:19,350
is a judge-free zone this is absolutely a judge-free zone
right now so it's pretty fucked up if you're judging

2879
04:17:25,770 --> 04:17:40,630
please please stop judging oh my gosh all right where was i
okay Okay, okay, I actually Um Um Actually was planning on

2880
04:17:40,630 --> 04:17:51,230
doing the stream For another hour So Um, I will let you guys
Pick what you want to do For the last hour

2881
04:17:54,490 --> 04:18:00,410
Because my My stream stamina Is going down now Okay

2882
04:18:04,130 --> 04:18:09,030
So, this time, I'm not doing the forklift thing again,
because I know I'm a prodigy.

2883
04:18:09,390 --> 04:18:11,090
I know I'm a prodigy right now.

2884
04:18:11,310 --> 04:18:15,450
I could do a custom server for you guys in Apex, if that's
what you guys really want.

2885
04:18:15,630 --> 04:18:16,450
Is that what you guys want?

2886
04:18:16,950 --> 04:18:18,250
You guys want a custom server?

2887
04:18:18,370 --> 04:18:27,490
We'll do one regular game, and one regular game, and one fun
game.

2888
04:18:28,030 --> 04:18:29,870
I think, I don't know what a fun game would be.

2889
04:18:32,370 --> 04:18:33,190
always been so fun.

2890
04:18:33,250 --> 04:18:34,750

2891
04:18:37,190 --> 04:18:38,210

04:18:57,750 --> 04:18:59,390
I haven't played Apex in a while.

2902
04:19:00,370 --> 04:19:03,470
I should have told her about my When did I last touch Apex?

2903
04:19:07,430 --> 04:19:10,110
Alright, but um...

2904
04:19:10,110 --> 04:19:12,610
Okay, we gotta turn down the volume, though.

2905
04:19:14,090 --> 04:19:14,490
Alright.

2906
04:19:14,870 --> 04:19:15,470

2915
04:19:41,580 --> 04:19:50,540

2916
04:19:50,760 --> 04:19:52,120

2963
04:23:42,920 --> 04:23:45,180

If you see, like, a crow near you, um, it means there's no
one near you.

2992
04:25:37,440 --> 04:25:44,280
Uh, crows usually are meant for, like, far far away but they

Guys, guys, you have to remember.

3030
04:28:22,080 --> 04:28:23,760

We're center zone.

3130
04:34:11,350 --> 04:34:12,570
There's nothing that could go wrong.

3131
04:34:13,090 --> 04:34:16,950
Except for these guys who might get, like, Krabber or some
shit.

I'm actually a little scared.

3134
04:34:18,930 --> 04:34:19,750
We might get Krabbered.

3135
04:34:21,290 --> 04:34:21,550
Alright.

3136
04:34:21,970 --> 04:34:22,570
It's okay.

04:34:24,670 --> 04:34:26,570
That's so good for us.

04:34:29,410 --> 04:34:30,290

3142
04:34:37,780 --> 04:34:38,360
Wait a minute.

3143
04:34:38,480 --> 04:34:39,120
I gotta make sure.

3144
04:34:39,800 --> 04:34:42,300
I gotta make sure there's nobody behind me.

3145
04:34:42,840 --> 04:34:43,160
Please.

3146
04:34:43,740 --> 04:34:44,220
Oh, they're fighting.

3147
04:34:44,280 --> 04:34:45,040
They're fighting over here.

3148
04:34:45,140 --> 04:34:46,180
Does anyone have a sniper?

3149
04:34:49,580 --> 04:34:51,740
I can barely see what's going on.

3150
04:34:53,520 --> 04:34:53,960
Alright.

3151
04:34:54,120 --> 04:34:54,560
It's fine.

3152
04:34:57,440 --> 04:34:59,520
I want to thirst this guy, but he's so fucking far.

3153
04:35:00,960 --> 04:35:01,840
God damn it.

3154
04:35:01,960 --> 04:35:03,440
I'm so close to thirsting him.

3155
04:35:04,780 --> 04:35:05,580
No, he's so close.

3156
04:35:05,780 --> 04:35:06,420
I can't hit your shot.

3157
04:35:08,980 --> 04:35:09,920
You know what?

3158
04:35:09,920 --> 04:35:10,540
Good for you.

3159
04:35:12,000 --> 04:35:13,460
I'm glad you hit your shot.

3160
04:35:14,980 --> 04:35:16,080
I'm happy for you.

3161
04:35:18,680 --> 04:35:19,180
All right.

3162
04:35:22,160 --> 04:35:23,020
All right, we're good.

3163
04:35:24,600 --> 04:35:25,240
Okay, we're in zone.

3164
04:35:25,360 --> 04:35:25,620
We're in zone.

3165
04:35:25,780 --> 04:35:26,420
Nothing to worry about.

3166
04:35:26,520 --> 04:35:26,960
We're in zone.

3167
04:35:29,100 --> 04:35:30,400
Okay, I gotta grab that.

3168
04:35:30,460 --> 04:35:32,200
I'm going to make sure there's nobody behind us, too.

3169
04:35:32,800 --> 04:35:33,960
That's what I'm worried about.

3170
04:35:34,140 --> 04:35:38,640
I need to make sure my backs are free from anybody that
wants to third us.

3171
04:35:40,160 --> 04:35:41,040
I'll take the redeploy.

3172
04:35:41,480 --> 04:35:42,160
Where's the redeploy?

3173
04:35:45,560 --> 04:35:47,140
There's people to my right.

3174
04:35:51,640 --> 04:35:53,040
Oh my god, he was flesh!

3175
04:35:54,980 --> 04:35:56,500
That guy was fucking flesh!

3176
04:35:57,840 --> 04:35:58,740
We're in zone, we're in zone.

3177
04:35:58,920 --> 04:35:59,180
We're in zone.

3178
04:35:59,360 --> 04:35:59,940
We don't have to worry.

3179
04:36:01,520 --> 04:36:01,960
Wait, what?

3180
04:36:03,520 --> 04:36:04,260
Wait, what?

3181
04:36:05,460 --> 04:36:07,960
I don't need that real fast.

3182
04:36:09,500 --> 04:36:09,960
No, it's fine.

3183
04:36:10,100 --> 04:36:10,400
It's okay.

3184
04:36:10,500 --> 04:36:11,200
We're so healthy.

3185
04:36:12,500 --> 04:36:14,200
We're so healthy right now.

3186
04:36:14,640 --> 04:36:15,140
It's fine.

3187
04:36:16,020 --> 04:36:17,320
Nothing to worry about.

3188
04:36:18,620 --> 04:36:19,200
I need energy.

3189
04:36:19,400 --> 04:36:20,220
Do you guys have energy?

3190
04:36:22,480 --> 04:36:23,460
Do you guys have energy?

3191
04:36:27,480 --> 04:36:29,320
Oh my god, we're all running energy.

3192
04:36:29,540 --> 04:36:30,880
Why are we all running energy?

3193
04:36:31,460 --> 04:36:32,760
Why are we all?

3194
04:36:35,180 --> 04:36:36,560
Guys, that was not very smart.

3195
04:36:36,580 --> 04:36:36,880
of us.

3196
04:36:37,080 --> 04:36:37,400
Wait, what?

3197
04:36:37,880 --> 04:36:38,120
Where?

3198
04:36:40,460 --> 04:36:40,980
Too hostile.

3199
04:36:41,160 --> 04:36:41,620
Above us!

3200
04:36:41,660 --> 04:36:42,600
Above us!

3201
04:36:42,600 --> 04:36:42,600
Above us!

3202
04:36:43,080 --> 04:36:43,920
Above us!

3203
04:36:49,180 --> 04:36:50,680
We got a wall.

3204
04:36:52,500 --> 04:36:54,300
Okay, they're right above us.

3205
04:36:55,620 --> 04:36:56,180
Put walls!

3206
04:36:56,680 --> 04:36:57,020
Cameron!

3207
04:36:57,560 --> 04:36:59,760
Use your master skills and put up walls!

3208
04:37:08,340 --> 04:37:09,180
Wait, what?

3209
04:37:12,860 --> 04:37:13,300
What?

3210
04:37:15,320 --> 04:37:17,460
Wait, did they put up the redeploy?

3211
04:37:17,800 --> 04:37:18,600
Oh, we're not there.

3212
04:37:19,380 --> 04:37:20,680
Guys, we can steal their redeploy.

3213
04:37:22,520 --> 04:37:24,360
Guys, we steal their redeploy.

3214
04:37:25,320 --> 04:37:25,640
Guys.

3215

04:49:35,210 --> 04:49:36,090
Grab this.

3463
04:49:38,550 --> 04:49:38,990

3476
04:49:57,290 --> 04:49:58,010
There's still that car.

3477
04:49:58,490 --> 04:49:59,410
The car is still there.

3478
04:49:59,550 --> 04:50:00,870
You can't get that car!

3479
04:50:00,950 --> 04:50:01,730
We get that car!

3480
04:50:01,830 --> 04:50:02,230

3481
04:50:02,970 --> 04:50:03,930
Wait, where is it?

3482
04:50:07,090 --> 04:50:08,370
It's still there.

3483
04:50:08,750 --> 04:50:08,950
All right.

3484
04:50:10,390 --> 04:50:12,670
Who's going to get... Who's going to have... Who has a
driver's license?

3485
04:50:13,370 --> 04:50:15,270
Guys, who has a driver's license?

3486
04:50:16,730 --> 04:50:17,050
Nice.

3487
04:50:17,210 --> 04:50:17,470
All right.

3488
04:50:18,330 --> 04:50:18,850
Nice.

3489
04:50:19,090 --> 04:50:19,310
All right.

3490
04:50:19,510 --> 04:50:21,810
Now we grab the yellow things.

3491
04:50:22,510 --> 04:50:23,610
There has to be another yellow.

3492
04:50:25,110 --> 04:50:25,590
All right.

3493
04:50:26,110 --> 04:50:26,970
We grab this.

3494
04:50:27,930 --> 04:50:27,930
This.

3495
04:50:29,570 --> 04:50:30,190
Step three.

3496
04:50:35,170 --> 04:50:36,890
Okay, I'll grab it, I'll grab it.

3497
04:50:39,210 --> 04:50:40,870
Okay, step three, we split up.

3498
04:50:41,390 --> 04:50:45,970
We split up and grab the yellow boxes until we're red armor.

3499
04:50:46,110 --> 04:50:46,910
I go for this.

3500
04:50:48,070 --> 04:50:51,010
Oh my god, this is like the most ingenious plan.

3501
04:50:51,070 --> 04:50:51,990
We're totally gonna...

3502
04:50:51,990 --> 04:50:52,950
Guys, we split up.

3503
04:50:53,070 --> 04:50:54,350
Guys, you don't have to follow me anymore.

3504
04:50:54,770 --> 04:50:57,090
We split up and grab until we're red armor.

3505
04:50:58,030 --> 04:51:00,250
Guys, this is our ingenious plan.

3506
04:51:01,310 --> 04:51:01,810
What the fuck?

3507
04:51:01,830 --> 04:51:02,830
How did... What?

3508
04:51:03,450 --> 04:51:05,190
Was there a jump pad there?

3509
04:51:06,710 --> 04:51:08,070
Wait, how do we get that?

3510
04:51:08,970 --> 04:51:10,790
Where the fuck is the yellow box here?

3511
04:51:11,450 --> 04:51:12,150
Is it underneath?

3512
04:51:13,030 --> 04:51:14,990
Oh, no, there's a melee guy here.

3513
04:51:16,950 --> 04:51:18,470
Okay, I can't be here, guys.

3514
04:51:19,430 --> 04:51:20,310
Step three failed.

3515
04:51:20,830 --> 04:51:22,130
I need to find another yellow box.

3516
04:51:22,230 --> 04:51:22,530
Oh, here.

3517
04:51:23,630 --> 04:51:24,190
It's okay.

3518
04:51:24,470 --> 04:51:26,090
It didn't work.

3519
04:51:27,110 --> 04:51:30,830
Look, I didn't account for them not allowing cars, okay?

3520
04:51:31,830 --> 04:51:40,870
for that instructions were a little bit unclear there that
there was like you know another car like another team and it

That would be so fucked up.

3526
04:52:08,950 --> 04:52:09,870
I'll go grab this one.

3527
04:52:10,170 --> 04:52:11,010
Don't worry, I got this.

3528
04:52:12,190 --> 04:52:13,630
Step five, ditch car.

3529
04:52:13,710 --> 04:52:14,430
No, no, no, no, no.

3530
04:52:16,230 --> 04:52:17,270
Cars are forever.

3531
04:52:20,150 --> 04:52:21,370
Wait, I can scan this.

3532
04:52:22,590 --> 04:52:23,270
God has a book.

3533
04:52:23,330 --> 04:52:24,290
Okay, we can't use that.

3534
04:52:25,430 --> 04:52:26,030

3535
04:52:26,110 --> 04:52:26,810

Alright, we have all the yellow stuff.

3546
04:53:01,170 --> 04:53:01,570

04:53:03,790 --> 04:53:05,470

Oh my god, look at them.

3554
04:53:18,350 --> 04:53:19,990

3555
04:53:20,550 --> 04:53:21,070
Okay.

3556
04:53:21,530 --> 04:53:24,130

Hey guys, are you also trying to get that?

3562
04:53:35,470 --> 04:53:36,410
Don't worry.

3563
04:53:39,330 --> 04:53:39,990

Why do you need to scan?

3659
04:58:19,710 --> 04:58:21,410
We're in melee only.

Don't worry.

3661
04:58:23,810 --> 04:58:24,490
We're red armor.

3662
04:58:24,610 --> 04:58:26,350
None of them have red armor like us.

3663
04:58:26,970 --> 04:58:28,830
None of them are as good as us, guys.

3664

Stay there.

3796
05:03:46,380 --> 05:03:46,820

05:04:10,280 --> 05:04:12,080
We almost had it there.

3808
05:04:13,840 --> 05:04:14,900
We almost got it.

3809
05:04:15,780 --> 05:04:16,620
What could have been?

3810
05:04:17,420 --> 05:04:18,660
What could have been?

3811
05:04:19,200 --> 05:04:20,000
Just stay in the car.

3812
05:04:20,380 --> 05:04:21,820
Stay in the car and keep bouncing.

3813
05:04:23,580 --> 05:04:24,420

But it has been crazy, though.

I think we raised in total almost $200,000, though.

3904
05:10:55,300 --> 05:10:56,680
We include the...

3905

3912
05:11:46,010 --> 05:11:49,010
Reminding that we originally said 200k for Visage.

If...

3922
05:12:06,550 --> 05:12:09,330
If we hit...

3923
05:12:09,330 --> 05:12:10,030
On the Tiltify.

3924
05:12:10,830 --> 05:12:11,910
If we hit...

3925
05:12:15,830 --> 05:12:16,870
78,000...

3926
05:12:16,870 --> 05:12:19,810

We don't want you, Doki.

3941

05:27:30,210 --> 05:27:31,650
The auction isn't even over.

4090
05:27:32,270 --> 05:27:47,370
have like guys 24 minus okay guys okay 23 22 21 20 19 18 we
just have 18 hours left out of out of the auction and the

4091
05:27:47,370 --> 05:27:58,370
fact that we were able to we were able to um raise so much
normally a lot of charity streams they're like 24 hours or

4092
05:27:58,370 --> 05:28:06,030
like multiple days but the fact that like you know the I
know like the stream itself not much was really like it was

4093
05:28:06,030 --> 05:28:12,570
mostly mostly focused on the auction and everything and it
was just like hanging out with you guys and just talking

4094
05:28:12,570 --> 05:28:19,130
about um the foundation and the items and just having like a
little hangout session with all you guys getting my forklift

4095
05:28:19,130 --> 05:28:26,670
simulator on before my actual forklift certification and
everything and the fact that we are able to how are you bad

4096
05:28:26,670 --> 05:28:33,850
at map because I'm fucking stupid I'm a streamer you think
this brain is used on numbers?

4097
05:28:34,370 --> 05:28:37,270
Why do you think I fucking do dumb shit for entertainment?

4098
05:28:40,390 --> 05:28:41,350
That's what you know.

4099
05:28:41,450 --> 05:28:42,930
I have no prospects in math.

4100
05:28:43,610 --> 05:28:47,330
Anyway, as I was saying, back to being like, fucking humble
and everything.

4101
05:28:48,270 --> 05:28:48,790
Back

4102
05:28:52,750 --> 05:28:55,990
to being, like, super humbled and generous.

4103
05:28:57,290 --> 05:28:57,650
Um.

4104
05:28:58,210 --> 05:28:58,750
Um.

4105
05:29:03,770 --> 05:29:05,630
as I was saying

4106
05:29:12,150 --> 05:29:18,650
other than the stream itself there wasn't really a lot
planned for the stream itself I just really wanted to use it

4107
05:29:18,650 --> 05:29:24,890
to like introduce the auction items I never really planned
on doing a very long charity stream because the full focus

4108
05:29:24,890 --> 05:29:37,110
was on the auction itself it was really is like an amazing
like just to see dragoons um just like you know working

4109
05:29:37,110 --> 05:29:48,410
together to raise so much money for such a good cause and um
being able to like and it's still going oh my god they're

4110
05:29:48,410 --> 05:29:56,710
fighting over the keyboard again bro and like stop but now
they're still fighting

4111
05:30:02,270 --> 05:30:05,050
It is trying so fucking hard for that keyboard.

4112
05:30:09,570 --> 05:30:10,290

4118
05:30:28,390 --> 05:30:32,190
For those who are new here, I'm wondering what, what is
everyone fighting about?

4288
05:40:25,400 --> 05:40:28,520
Alright, we're gonna delete this...

4289
05:40:28,520 --> 05:40:31,220
Because we're definitely not gonna hit 400k.

4290
05:40:31,420 --> 05:40:32,720
We're gonna...

4291
05:40:34,440 --> 05:40:36,980
There's no way we're hitting that.

4292
05:40:37,420 --> 05:40:38,240
That's for sure.

4293
05:40:38,560 --> 05:40:39,840
All right, we're going to delete this.

4294
05:40:40,000 --> 05:40:41,760
And then we're going to put this up here.

4295
05:40:42,160 --> 05:40:44,840

4296
05:40:45,900 --> 05:40:48,520

4297
05:40:49,620 --> 05:40:50,120
Yay!

4298
05:40:50,740 --> 05:40:51,560

4299
05:40:51,680 --> 05:40:51,920

4302
05:40:54,960 --> 05:40:56,040

4303
05:40:56,320 --> 05:40:57,040
Okay, 200.

4304
05:40:58,640 --> 05:41:00,300

4305
05:41:00,300 --> 05:41:01,500

Our calendar real quick.

4307
05:41:03,800 --> 05:41:06,760
because I can finally get rid of the 400k goal.

4308
05:41:09,840 --> 05:41:11,340
Toki, cheater.

4309
05:41:12,500 --> 05:41:14,920
There's no way you're going to hit Elden Ring.

4310
05:41:15,680 --> 05:41:17,780
Guys, there's no negotiating with that.

4311
05:41:19,340 --> 05:41:21,440
There's no more negotiating.

4312
05:41:22,520 --> 05:41:23,060
You're...

4313
05:41:23,060 --> 05:41:23,720
Wait, what?

4314
05:41:23,860 --> 05:41:25,360
You're not 1.3k away.

4315
05:41:25,480 --> 05:41:26,460
It's 7.7.

4316
05:41:26,620 --> 05:41:27,300
We've agreed.

4317
05:41:27,620 --> 05:41:29,980
We've established that you have...

4318
05:41:29,980 --> 05:41:33,060
You are going to hit 9k and that...

4319
05:41:33,060 --> 05:41:34,420
And that we have...

4320
05:41:34,420 --> 05:41:36,000
Okay, how much time do we have left?

4321
05:41:36,440 --> 05:41:38,120
46 minus 60.

4322
05:41:38,480 --> 05:41:40,480
There is 14 minutes left.

4323
05:41:41,120 --> 05:41:44,240
Okay, if you guys need 14 minutes left.

4324
05:41:46,920 --> 05:41:47,860
There we go.

4325
05:41:48,200 --> 05:41:48,520

05:41:55,660 --> 05:42:00,040
You have 14 minutes left to hit 90k.

4330
05:42:00,740 --> 05:42:02,060

05:52:37,730 --> 05:52:39,550
Just on Tiltify alone.

4468
05:52:40,150 --> 05:52:40,570
In total.

4469
05:52:42,810 --> 05:52:45,130
If the auction is still going on.

4470
05:52:45,790 --> 05:52:53,310
So currently we've raised, including the waiting room
charity.

4471
05:52:53,810 --> 05:52:56,850
We raised in total around, I believe.

4472
05:52:56,950 --> 05:53:10,130
almost 200k and i think like that's something we should all
be incredibly proud of to be able to raise um 200 000 us

4473
05:53:10,130 --> 05:53:21,070
dollars for um uh cause for two caught charity causes
regarding um mental health and both awareness and research

4474
05:53:21,070 --> 05:53:30,090
uh thank you everybody thank you again it is amazing um even
you know this is only like a six hour stream we managed to

4475
05:53:30,090 --> 05:53:38,150
raise so much money within just six hours and the auction is
still going on so maybe we'll be raising even more money in

4476
05:53:38,150 --> 05:53:44,370
the end within when the other side of the world wakes up for
those if they're still they want to bid on anything as well
