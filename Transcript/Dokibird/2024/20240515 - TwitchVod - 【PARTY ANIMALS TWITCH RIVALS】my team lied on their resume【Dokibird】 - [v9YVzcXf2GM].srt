00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:27,800

00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:25,870

120
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:56,190

121
00:09:56,890 --> 00:09:57,330

122
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:58,510

00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:35,950
fucking scrimming you they were scrimming party animals not
for like two weeks two to three weeks why didn't you set up

176
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:44,350
scrims like why did i not set up would you join would you
actually join scrims if i set it up would you though sure

177
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:53,590
for yeah i'll take that as a no i'm always down for scrim

178
00:11:57,610 --> 00:12:00,650
Yeah, I don't think you would fucking scrim party animals.

179
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:10,230
But yeah, I was watching fucking a drop with the full-on
Apex roster screaming at party animals and hard-comming.

180
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:11,850
It was actually crazy.

181
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:14,250
Apex players are sweats.

182
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:17,190
Wait, what's the comparison between...

183
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:18,730
What about Apex versus Overwatch?

184
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:19,470
Who's sweatier?

185
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:21,730
Apex?

186
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:26,830
I think Overwatch tries to be sweatier, but it just comes
across more depressing.

187
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:37,070
shit is that true as an overwatch player yeah we've gone
through enough one tricks that never swapped that we just

188
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:46,470
we've become complacent with everything that's so true
that's so i was the one trick so you know you were the

189
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:55,370
problem i was in mercy main oh you were part of the problem
you were 100 i would avoid it you i avoided you and avoided

190
00:12:55,370 --> 00:13:02,110
you No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

191
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:04,730
Do you know what the game mode is?

192
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:06,950
It's Lollipop Factory.

193
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:09,130
Lollipop, yeah.

194
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:10,710
Yeah, so I'm wearing you.

195
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:12,230
You collect the sheet.

196
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:17,070
Yeah, and then you have to move it to, like, a little tray,
and then you have to pull the lever to put the tray in.

197
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:19,850
And then there's, like, a big gummy bear that's worth, like,
way more.

198
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:22,610
Yeah, I'm just going to be beating the shit out of that.

199
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:25,210
Okay, okay, so, like, what's the strat for this?

200
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:27,590
I remember when I tried to play this, and I got...

201
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:28,670
Absolutely destroyed.

202
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:34,530
You have people trying to stop them from putting in candy
and then you have people on your team putting the candy and

203
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:36,030
I'm gonna be interference.

204
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:36,790
Okay.

205
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:38,130
I'm just gonna be beating the shit.

206
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:41,410
Okay, I'll help bring candy over.

207
00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:43,010
You gotta protect me.

208
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:44,790
They don't and I will bring candy over.

209
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:45,950
I don't know what Bree's gonna do.

210
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:49,630
Oh, I will beat people up.

211
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:50,270
Okay.

212
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:51,930
Are you good at beating people up?

213
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:53,590
Yes.

214
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:54,650
Okay, okay.

215
00:13:55,090 --> 00:13:57,570
And you're not lying to me like how you lied earlier.

216
00:13:57,590 --> 00:13:58,510
I would never.

217
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:01,650
I will protect you.

218
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:05,190
I'm indiscriminate in my beating.

219
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:06,030
All right.

220
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:08,270
Wait, no, you're not supposed to beat us up.

221
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:09,370
You're part of the team.

222
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:10,310
Yeah, wait.

223
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:13,570
If I have an AoE weapon, you guys are caught in the
crossfire.

224
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:14,530
There's nothing I can do about it.

225
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:15,070
Then we lose.

226
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:15,330
You know what?

227
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:15,730
That's fair.

228
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:16,890
I thought you want to win.

229
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:18,630
Hey, listen.

230
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:21,450
If I have the lollipop sick...

231
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:22,070
This is just party animals.

232
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:22,810

233
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:23,610
You just...

234
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:24,190
There's AoE.

235
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:24,830
You just gotta take it serious.

236
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:26,330
I'm serious.

237
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:26,590

00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:42,110
Oh!

350
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:44,170
I'm going...

351
00:19:44,170 --> 00:19:45,690
I'm dragging it!

352
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:45,950
No!

353
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:47,710
I'm going for the little ones.

354
00:19:47,810 --> 00:19:48,230
Fuck this.

355
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:49,710
You guys can deal with that.

356
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:50,690
I know my place.

357
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:52,990
You got to punch him.

358
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:53,390
Nice.

359
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:54,130
You got him.

360
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:54,710
We won the game.

361
00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:55,710
We won the game.

362
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:56,470
Yay!

363
00:19:57,050 --> 00:19:57,450
Yay!

364
00:19:57,450 --> 00:19:57,550
Yay!

365
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:06,290
Okay, I'm pretty sure Buzzball is the one where there's a
ball and you have to throw it in the goal and if you hold it

366
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:07,230
too long, it explodes.

367
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:08,370
Oh, okay.

368
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:09,450
Oh, okay.

369
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:10,570
Oh, yeah.

370
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:11,370
It's like soccer.

371
00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:14,350
Okay, I get it.

372
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:14,990
Yay!

373
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:16,150
I got a cow!

374
00:20:17,810 --> 00:20:19,430
I got the avatar.

375
00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:25,630
I'm glad we're unlocking characters that we can get for
playing the game once.

376
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:28,170
It's okay.

377
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:29,470
I believe in...

378
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:29,970
You know what?

379
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:31,870
After that first game, you know what?

380
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:32,770
I believe in us.

381
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:37,370
I didn't believe in us before we started, but now I believe
in us.

382
00:20:38,930 --> 00:20:39,370
It's hot.

383
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:40,510
Oh, I love this one.

384
00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:46,830
If you get into that little thing at the end and you just
press right click, it usually gets thrown in.

385
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:47,270
Okay.

386
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:48,770
Boom.

387
00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:50,510
I'm using controllers.

388
00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:52,530
So what's right click on the controller?

389
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:54,390
I don't know.

390
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:56,150
I use keyboard and mouse so good luck.

391
00:20:57,310 --> 00:21:05,610
Whatever you throw is, if two people if two people hold on
to the ball it explodes oh okay so we shouldn't hold okay

392
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:14,070
well you can sometimes it's clutch oh wait you got it you
got it you got it right click it yeah easy to go over your

393
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:26,190
fucking life you just locked up and just fucking what what
the hell just happened i did it so that's the throw button

394
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:30,050
That's easy, guys.

395
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:31,190
Okay, I'll keep them.

396
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:31,750
No!

397
00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:33,390
Oh, guys!

398
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:34,310
Enough one.

399
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:34,670
Okay.

400
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:36,750
All right, go, go, go!

401
00:21:37,410 --> 00:21:38,310
Okay, I know too!

402
00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:38,990
You got it!

403
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:39,590
You're going!

404
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:40,390
Go, go, go!

405
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:41,230
Oh!

406
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:42,130
We got big!

407
00:21:42,770 --> 00:21:43,030
No!

408
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:44,050
Someone punched me out.

409
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:45,810
It wasn't me, I swear.

410
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:47,650
I know.

411
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:49,070
It was an enemy.

412
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:49,710
Oh!

413
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:50,610
The bats got it!

414
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:51,330
The bats got it!

415
00:21:52,370 --> 00:21:52,850
No!

416
00:21:53,170 --> 00:21:53,390
Oh!

417
00:21:56,170 --> 00:21:56,530
Oh!

418
00:21:56,710 --> 00:21:57,810
I got my rocked out.

419
00:21:57,970 --> 00:21:58,230
No!

420
00:21:59,190 --> 00:21:59,710
Punch it, boom!

421
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:00,130
Get it out!

422
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:02,090
Just hold on to it.

423
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:02,810
It's going to go up.

424
00:22:02,910 --> 00:22:03,510
Oh, no!

425
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:04,230
Okay, that's fine.

426
00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:04,590
That's fine.

427
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:06,170
That's fine.

428
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:06,910
That's fine.

429
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:07,650
Oh, no, it's not fine!

430
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:10,150
It's not fine!

431
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:13,150
It was in the end.

432
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:14,070
Not fine.

433
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:16,590
We got the bad RNG.

434
00:22:16,810 --> 00:22:18,430
I was hoping it would go to their side.

435
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:23,110
Here we go.

436
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:24,870
This time we got it.

437
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:26,290
I believe in us, team.

438
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:28,150
Oh, no.

439
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:28,950
Oh, my God.

440
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:29,450
Oh, my God.

441
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:29,930
That's not...

442
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:33,030
Nice throw.

443

Let's go!

478
00:25:21,910 --> 00:25:23,130
I don't mean practice.

479
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:23,750
Look at us!

480
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:24,210
Just run it!

481
00:25:24,210 --> 00:25:25,430
Just do that every single time.

482
00:25:26,990 --> 00:25:28,890
Just run it down mid every single time.

483
00:25:28,890 --> 00:25:29,810
Just run it down!

484
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:32,510
I knew Tyler Wanderer was right in some ways.

485
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:37,350
My philosophy, run it down.

486
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:38,430
Okay, never mind, I'm out.

487
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:40,850
Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

He fucked up.

It's fine, it's fine, it's fine.

491

494
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:47,650
He didn't fuck up!

495
00:25:47,810 --> 00:25:48,390
You liar!

496
00:25:48,770 --> 00:25:49,050
It's okay.

497
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:50,310
This will make the comeback better.

498
00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:50,750
It's fine.

499
00:25:51,330 --> 00:25:54,030
Instead of punching him, I just need to grab him.

500
00:25:54,290 --> 00:25:56,250
Because the punch was missing.

501
00:25:57,050 --> 00:25:58,190
Yeah, that's not good.

502
00:25:58,350 --> 00:26:00,570
I just, I grabbed someone and I dragged him away.

503

All right, this is the last one.

508
00:26:52,330 --> 00:26:53,490

Oh, God.

I'm not there.

Do you need help?

519
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:07,070
Do you need help?

520
00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:08,710
Oh, I got it.

521
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:09,870

Oh, they're fucking they're harassing me.

We won.

526
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:25,500
Oh, my God, three people can't stop me.

527
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:27,280
That was four people.

528
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:28,120
Oh, shit.

529
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:35,000

534
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:17,480
chaos is the same thing as the candy one only have to put
the luggage on conveyor belts and then they slowly go into a

535
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:23,680
separate area that luggage like you can't drag the luggage
into that area you have to like parkour into it and then you

536
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:28,540
grab the luggage off the conveyor belts okay and then you
put it in like the candy and you just dump it down with the

537
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:34,700
lever oh okay so it's just the lever stuff again okay so
yeah it's just like slightly confusing like you can't just

538
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:40,080
walk it to the the dumping place you have to on the conveyor
belt and then it goes through like a little machine and then

539
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:48,860
you grab it after i see i see okay so like so you it's the
same thing you two are the punching people then did it and i

And I know what I was doing.

544
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:21,640
I still don't know what I'm doing, but, like, we're winning,
so that's all that matters.

545
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,640
Constantly say that you do, it's fine.

546
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:31,440
Is this Connor, as in Connor?

547
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:33,020

00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:57,940
What is this conversation that you're having?

558
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:58,540
What?

559
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:00,860
They were asking about their favorite swear words.

560
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:03,020
Chib asked me about my favorite swear word.

561
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:03,360
Oh, okay.

562
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:05,380
Oh, whoa.

00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:06,580
What was it, bitch?

564
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:07,760
I saw it was bitch, right?

565
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,380
Your name is inappropriate.

566
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,740
I slayed cats.

567
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:23,380
Yeah, it's a game about slaying animals.

568
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:24,700
It's just our team.

569
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:25,480
You're larping.

570
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:29,720

571
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,300
Oh my god, he loves a lorp, too.

572
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:35,560
I play Destiny 2.

573
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:37,960
How do you chat?

574
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:39,240
Oh, you enter.

575
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:39,840
Just press enter.

576
00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:50,890
I mean, no, I don't.

577
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:52,110
I played Destiny 2.

578
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:53,990
I don't.

579
00:30:54,290 --> 00:30:58,290
If the streams are deleted, doesn't mean it never existed.

580
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:02,550
Like...

581
00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:05,030
Did you stream it on Tuesdays?

582
00:31:05,050 --> 00:31:06,170
I'm pretty sure that's a special day.

583
00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:07,650
Oh, yeah, that's a special Tuesday.

584
00:31:08,690 --> 00:31:09,330
Every Tuesday.

585
00:31:11,910 --> 00:31:13,650
Sunday is the only sacred day.

586
00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:15,710
Why is Sunday a sacred day?

587
00:31:16,930 --> 00:31:18,250
Because I don't play Overwatch.

588
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:23,070
That's Variety Day.

589
00:31:23,290 --> 00:31:25,790
When you're... when you're... Wait, I thought Tuesday's a
Variety Day.

590
00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:26,970
And what the fuck is Tuesday?

591
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:28,010
No, that's Wednesday.

592
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:29,310
Wednesday and Sunday.

593
00:31:29,810 --> 00:31:30,410
Wednesday is Sunday.

594
00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:31,350
Wait, then what's Tuesday?

595
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:35,570
We don't talk about it.

596
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:36,350
What's Tuesday?

597
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:38,650
If Tuesday... if... If... Then is it Overwatch?

598
00:31:39,090 --> 00:31:41,290
So you stream Overwatch with your V-Tuber?

599
00:31:42,770 --> 00:31:43,090
No.

600
00:31:43,670 --> 00:31:44,770
Then what the fuck is Tuesday?

601
00:31:47,290 --> 00:31:49,110
Do you say whatever I wanted to be?

602
00:31:49,170 --> 00:31:51,950
It's whatever I wanted to be.

603
00:31:52,630 --> 00:31:52,890
Yeah.

604
00:31:54,630 --> 00:31:55,750
Valid, valid, valid.

605
00:31:57,150 --> 00:31:57,710
I'm valid.

606
00:31:58,530 --> 00:31:58,950
You're valid.

607
00:31:59,350 --> 00:31:59,670
That's right.

608
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:00,290
You are.

609
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:05,930
Okay, apparently we finished it so fast that we have to wait
for the other games to be done.

610
00:32:06,170 --> 00:32:06,970
We're just that good.

611
00:32:07,090 --> 00:32:07,830
We're that bad.

612
00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:09,690
Okay, until we face- We're so good at this game.

613
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:12,710
Until we face the Apex team that's in this.

614
00:32:13,370 --> 00:32:13,850
The Apex.

615
00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:14,970
Wait, which team is that?

616
00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:15,750
I don't know.

617
00:32:15,870 --> 00:32:16,870
That is team.

618
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:18,530
It's drops.

619
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:19,110
It's team.

620
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:21,310
It's rogue's team team six.

621
00:32:22,170 --> 00:32:27,750
That's the apex team because no, I think we could go against
them I mean, these are basically like training rounds, you

622
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:28,230
know?

623
00:32:28,810 --> 00:32:32,170
Yeah, but it's gonna just determine our seeding.

624
00:32:33,010 --> 00:32:37,090

You don't count it.

640
00:33:52,370 --> 00:33:55,510
It doesn't matter how much you spend the money on this game.

641
00:33:55,630 --> 00:33:56,950
It doesn't matter!

642
00:33:57,710 --> 00:33:58,170
Yeah.

643
00:33:58,650 --> 00:34:02,030
If it doesn't matter, then you would tell me how much you
spend, right?

644
00:34:02,570 --> 00:34:05,210
It does matter if you have fun or not.

645

Yeah, so...

646
00:34:06,790 --> 00:34:11,630
So if it doesn't matter how much you spend, then you should
be open to telling me how much you spend.

00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:51,280
How do you think about Genshin?

669
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:53,760
Did you like it or did you stop because it was boring?

Listen, gotcha games.

00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:09,240
I only play gotcha games for PvP because like the whole
point of gotcha games is supposed to be like buying Gucci

674
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:10,840
wallets but for like weebs.

675
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:14,760
They're supposed to be flexing other PvP roster.

676
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:21,440
I'm surprised you haven't tried out Nikkei.

677
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:24,660
Why the fuck would I play Nikkei?

678
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:29,220
If I wanted to look at anime girl ass, I would look at
something else.

679
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:30,780
Like what?

680
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:32,780

682
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:36,720
Yeah.

683
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,240
What do you say?

684
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,120
I think that's self-explanatory.

685
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:40,400
Wait, what do you say?

686
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:40,860
You know what that is?

687
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:42,060
What do you say?

688
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:42,720
It's a pentai.

689
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:53,140
I can't play no gotcha game for that.

690
00:36:57,650 --> 00:36:58,950
That's not cool.

691
00:36:59,570 --> 00:37:00,090
All right, chat.

692
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:01,110
Rate his taste.

693
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:02,010
Is it...

694
00:37:05,650 --> 00:37:07,770
Wait, this is a few of a chat.

695
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:10,070
Like, do you have any recommendations?

696
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:14,710
Now, there's some good ones, but I'm not going to say them
out loud.

697
00:37:15,470 --> 00:37:16,250
That's TOS.

698
00:37:17,850 --> 00:37:20,530
You actually getting bad, saying it?

699
00:37:21,210 --> 00:37:22,810
Pushing Slayer isn't TOS.

700
00:37:23,010 --> 00:37:29,190
Yeah, but you say it out loud on Twitch instead of writing

That's similar.

703
00:37:34,990 --> 00:37:37,750

We watched you walk into their goal in the first five.

737
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:13,210
I don't think we can be faster.

00:40:16,610 --> 00:40:18,550

Oh, I like the fact that we have Pussy Slayer on the team so
that...

741
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:32,270
As we do better and better, we just have to constantly pay
attention to the first Pussy Slayer as they talk about it.

742
00:40:32,590 --> 00:40:33,890
That, I thrive on that.

743

873
00:48:07,190 --> 00:48:09,130
They're harassing me right now.

This is probably...

918
00:49:46,490 --> 00:49:47,410
I don't think this is our map.

919
00:49:47,570 --> 00:49:49,270
This is definitely not our game.

920
00:49:52,150 --> 00:49:53,430

921
00:49:55,470 --> 00:49:55,870

00:49:59,490 --> 00:49:59,990
It's okay.

924
00:50:00,090 --> 00:50:01,930
The next one is the soccer game.

925
00:50:02,130 --> 00:50:02,370
Oh, shit.

926
00:50:02,370 --> 00:50:02,930
We can do that.

927
00:50:02,990 --> 00:50:03,710
We can do that.

00:50:05,070 --> 00:50:05,990

what they're doing they have plans yeah maybe they were

935

941
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:36,890
We can lose like one round one one matchup.

942
00:51:36,950 --> 00:51:41,010
It's no we can't lose Otherwise, it'll seem like we're
cheating.

I'm beating up the goalie and I are distracted for our team
distracting the goalie.

953
00:52:04,330 --> 00:52:05,570
We can't hit each other.

Maybe we need another one.

996
00:54:24,830 --> 00:54:25,850
Maybe we need another player.

997
00:54:33,250 --> 00:54:34,430
There you go.

00:54:36,510 --> 00:54:41,430
So he spent the entire game just fighting someone in the
quarter and then instantly won.

1000
00:54:43,310 --> 00:54:44,850
It's just that easy.

1001
00:54:45,110 --> 00:54:46,090
What can I say?

1002
00:54:46,610 --> 00:54:48,930

You thought it was done with you?

1006
00:54:57,670 --> 00:54:59,490
The goalie's distracted again!

00:54:59,770 --> 00:55:01,110

00:55:13,770 --> 00:55:14,670
The little bear guy here or the corgi.

1018
00:55:14,830 --> 00:55:16,130
He's the one that sets up the combo.

1019
00:55:17,550 --> 00:55:17,710
Oh shit.

1020
00:55:17,710 --> 00:55:17,870

You thought you could get away from me.

1046
00:56:17,270 --> 00:56:18,570
You thought you could get away from me.

1047
00:56:18,950 --> 00:56:20,650
Okay, she did got away from me.

1048
00:56:22,470 --> 00:56:23,210
Swicking right.

1049
00:56:23,350 --> 00:56:23,710
Oh!

1050
00:56:23,930 --> 00:56:24,610
The goalie's gone.

1051
00:56:24,790 --> 00:56:25,370
The goalie's gone!

1052
00:56:25,550 --> 00:56:26,170
The goalie's gone!

1053
00:56:26,890 --> 00:56:27,090
Quick!

1054
00:56:27,310 --> 00:56:27,530
Okay.

1055
00:56:27,550 --> 00:56:29,270
Yeah, well, we need to get the bro over there.

1056
00:56:34,610 --> 00:56:37,330

00:56:37,370 --> 00:56:38,750
Nice, nice, nice.

1058
00:56:39,050 --> 00:56:40,530
I feel like I have to play defense.

1059
00:56:40,730 --> 00:56:41,030
I'm scared.

1060
00:56:43,530 --> 00:56:47,490
I didn't want you guys to go there while I distract the
goalie.

1061
00:56:48,250 --> 00:56:49,970
The problem is I need to play defense.

1062
00:56:50,150 --> 00:56:52,150
I can't play Dws恩 offense at the same time.

1063
00:56:52,170 --> 00:56:53,570
That's what midfield is.

1064
00:56:54,290 --> 00:56:57,190
That's what midfield is D in offense.

1065
00:56:58,070 --> 00:56:59,350
That's the name for midfield.

1066
00:57:01,030 --> 00:57:11,690
go full offense then oh wait all right i'm going on the
offense all right okay okay all right what the it's back oh

1069
00:57:33,740 --> 00:57:35,940
Wait, I thought you were fucking offense.

1070
00:57:36,080 --> 00:57:36,560
What happened?

1071
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:41,060
I'm just trying to do what I think will be the best right
now.

1072
00:57:44,380 --> 00:57:45,620
Look at that.

1073
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:46,720
Look at that edge.

1074
00:57:46,740 --> 00:57:48,000
Yeah, but there's no offense.

1075
00:57:48,300 --> 00:57:49,240
There's no offense.

1076
00:57:52,380 --> 00:57:53,320
I'm scared.

1077
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:56,200
If I'm not over there, the ball's going to go into the goal.

1078
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:00,540
Oh, big pass.

1079
00:58:00,860 --> 00:58:01,480
There you go.

1080
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:01,700
Go pass.

1081
00:58:01,980 --> 00:58:02,240
There you go.

1082
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:02,660
Go offense.

1083
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:05,740
This is your job.

1084
00:58:07,260 --> 00:58:10,720
Yeah, well, unfortunately, I pass it mid.

1085
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:11,160
Oh my god.

1086
00:58:11,480 --> 00:58:12,460
You're passing, okay.

1087
00:58:13,580 --> 00:58:14,420
I'm going it, I'm going up.

1088
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:16,900
You know how soccer works and it's not passing.

1089
00:58:17,780 --> 00:58:19,340
I thought you were offense.

1090
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:20,800
Fucking offense.

1091
00:58:20,860 --> 00:58:22,860
I can't solo Ronaldo this.

1092
00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:25,500
I thought you were messy.

1093
00:58:25,720 --> 00:58:26,520
What happened?

1094
00:58:27,860 --> 00:58:28,300
I saw.

1095
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:29,400
Let's go.

1096
00:58:29,420 --> 00:58:30,100
Watch our fire.

1097
00:58:30,220 --> 00:58:31,000
What is this?

1098
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:33,480
I have three on me.

1099
00:58:33,740 --> 00:58:44,940
we have a minute i'm trying i got it i got it

1100
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:53,940
all i'm saying is i would have scored nice block bullshit

1101
00:58:57,320 --> 00:59:10,140
we definitely lost i did score though i gave us our one
point score i set up that score i jumped kicked i jumped

1102
00:59:10,140 --> 00:59:11,220
kicked into it at the start

1103
00:59:16,020 --> 00:59:25,120
it's just so sad it just wasn't for us this was not around
we were against minecraft if this was banjo ball if this was

1104
00:59:25,120 --> 00:59:35,700
banjo ball they would have been on what the what the is
banjo ball it's a warcraft 3 custom game you should say up a

1105
00:59:35,700 --> 00:59:42,220
warcraft three twitch rivals and then invite them back i've
been saying that i've been saying that wait why can't you do

1106
00:59:42,220 --> 00:59:52,100
it i'm not a set up guy you're not a set up guy no you
basically i'm like a side character main character oh okay

1107
00:59:52,100 --> 00:59:59,700
wait but like twitch rivals is like it's like really easy
though to set up because like twitch does most of the work

1108
01:00:00,920 --> 01:00:10,040
nah then i would have to like message someone that's out of
my pay grade they come to you i'd rather play runescape

1109
01:00:14,500 --> 01:00:22,700
has there ever been a runescape choice which rivals uh
they've had like dead man modes and what's dead man mode i

1110
01:00:22,700 --> 01:00:31,240
don't it's like basically where you play runescape normally
but you have insane xp rates and if you die once you're out

1111
01:00:31,240 --> 01:00:36,900
of the tournament oh like a giant battle royale Roomscape
map.

1112
01:00:36,900 --> 01:00:38,400
Wait, were you part of it or...

1113
01:00:39,180 --> 01:00:39,960
Hell no.

1114
01:00:40,380 --> 01:00:41,220
I know, it seems...

1115
01:00:41,220 --> 01:00:42,740
Why do I thought you love Roomscape?

1116
01:00:43,500 --> 01:00:45,120
I'm not that autistic.

1117
01:00:57,220 --> 01:01:01,320
But you are on the spectrum though, because I remember you
took the test.

1118
01:01:03,120 --> 01:01:03,620
You took...

1119
01:01:03,620 --> 01:01:03,880
Hell no.

1120
01:01:03,980 --> 01:01:04,600
Yes, you did.

1121
01:01:04,680 --> 01:01:05,560
You took the test!

1122
01:01:05,860 --> 01:01:09,240
Listen, every time I've gone to a psychologist, they've said
I'm normal.

1123
01:01:09,620 --> 01:01:10,560
I don't want to tell you.

1124
01:01:10,820 --> 01:01:12,520
But you took the test!

1125
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:14,540
It's okay.

1126
01:01:14,680 --> 01:01:17,840
Are you saying that an internet test is better?

1127
01:01:18,100 --> 01:01:20,620
It was a really good internet test though.

1128
01:01:20,680 --> 01:01:23,940
It was like a couple of pages like.

1129
01:01:24,180 --> 01:01:27,160
It was like a couple of pages like.

1130
01:01:28,060 --> 01:01:32,300
They were trying to make me take the test and I was like,
I'm scared of knowing what I am.

1131
01:01:32,500 --> 01:01:34,180
It said I might be.

1132
01:01:34,380 --> 01:01:35,740
It said I might be.

1133
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:37,120
Oh.

1134
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:39,580
Wait, do you remember the number?

1135
01:01:40,840 --> 01:01:47,080
Uh, there's a different, in one Discord I'm in, we make sure
everyone takes the test and then we put the number beside

1136
01:01:47,080 --> 01:01:48,180
their name of the test.

1137
01:01:48,340 --> 01:01:49,300
That's really funny.

1138
01:01:49,960 --> 01:01:50,680
What's the number?

1139
01:01:51,420 --> 01:01:55,860
I was a 28, but if I answer the question, like I'm able to
imagine things, I was a six.

1140
01:01:57,300 --> 01:01:58,220
Who does that mean?

1141
01:01:59,260 --> 01:02:00,240
I can't imagine things.

1142
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:02,360
I was a, oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

1143
01:02:02,560 --> 01:02:03,880
Yeah, empathy, yes, yeah.

1144
01:02:04,580 --> 01:02:04,720
Yeah.

1145
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:04,960
Yeah.

1146
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:07,740
I was a 169.

1147
01:02:08,620 --> 01:02:09,860
I think different tests.

1148
01:02:09,940 --> 01:02:10,980
I'm thinking went that high.

1149
01:02:11,040 --> 01:02:11,560
Oh, okay.

1150
01:02:13,300 --> 01:02:31,500

1151
01:02:31,500 --> 01:02:44,500

apparently there's one more game they have to wait to

1152
01:02:44,500 --> 01:02:45,060
finish.

1153
01:02:45,820 --> 01:02:46,880
And then...

1154
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:48,620
That we weren't the slowest.

1155
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:50,620
That was like the world's longest match.

1156
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:52,840
That was the longest soccer match ever though.

1157
01:02:52,940 --> 01:02:53,580
That wasn't that long.

1158
01:02:53,960 --> 01:02:58,020
Actually, to be fair, we did lose really quickly and then
the last one was just long.

1159
01:02:58,520 --> 01:03:00,180
Okay, the luggage one was, yeah.

1160
01:03:01,380 --> 01:03:02,640
That was a disaster.

1161
01:03:02,840 --> 01:03:07,980
The luggage one was, yeah, that was a, I accidentally like
took some of our briefcases to the end.

1162
01:03:08,040 --> 01:03:08,420
Oh my god.

1163
01:03:09,060 --> 01:03:10,320
I was confused.

1164
01:03:16,580 --> 01:03:28,220
I was The instructions were so unclear You'll get it next
time That's okay If they put that in that If they put

we do We have a system We'll be We're gonna be so ready for

1166
01:03:37,960 --> 01:03:48,140
the next round I'm always ready What is the third Third game
The third round is team score into the game.

1167
01:03:48,320 --> 01:03:49,220
What's into the game?

1168
01:03:49,640 --> 01:03:50,580
Oh, is that the arcade?

1169
01:03:53,480 --> 01:03:56,120
No, we're doing winter is coming.

1170
01:03:56,760 --> 01:03:57,880
No, that's the, that's game.

1171
01:03:57,940 --> 01:03:58,560
That's round two.

1172
01:03:59,700 --> 01:04:00,000
Oh.

1173
01:04:00,560 --> 01:04:01,640
Are we still on round?

1174
01:04:01,820 --> 01:04:02,440
Oh, wait, no.

1175
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:03,120
We're on round three.

1176
01:04:03,220 --> 01:04:03,760
Yeah, yeah.

1177
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:04,300
We lost two.

1178
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:05,240
All right.

1179
01:04:05,240 --> 01:04:05,980
Into the game.

1180
01:04:06,580 --> 01:04:06,980
Yeah, so.

1181
01:04:07,240 --> 01:04:07,940
Am I out of Google it?

1182
01:04:08,040 --> 01:04:08,780
Can I Google that?

1183
01:04:08,780 --> 01:04:10,280
That's the, that's the arcade one.

1184
01:04:10,560 --> 01:04:11,260
Yeah, the arcade.

1185
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:13,680
Ooh.

1186
01:04:14,660 --> 01:04:15,060
Um.

1187
01:04:15,140 --> 01:04:16,420
Oh my god.

1188
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:20,060
So we need someone that we need someone that's dedicated and
going into the game.

1189
01:04:20,180 --> 01:04:20,740
I can do that.

1190
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:21,600
I can do that.

1191
01:04:21,980 --> 01:04:28,020
We can also like I found out that if you like take their
arcade machine, you can take you can like go to the bombs

1192
01:04:28,020 --> 01:04:30,180
yourself and make them lose score.

1193
01:04:30,860 --> 01:04:34,420
Oh yeah, but I feel like that's a waste because then you're
just gonna get punched out.

1194
01:04:35,140 --> 01:04:35,640
That's true.

1195
01:04:36,100 --> 01:04:37,900
Or do you still get the shield when you go into there?

1196
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:39,040
Yeah, you get the shield though.

1197
01:04:39,980 --> 01:04:42,560
So like it's worth the risk to make them lose points.

1198
01:04:42,900 --> 01:04:43,700
And you're wasting time.

1199
01:04:44,120 --> 01:04:44,420
Yeah.

1200
01:04:45,140 --> 01:04:51,620
i feel like if you knock them out you go to oh team joki
feel free to leave the lobby they want us to leave okay why

1201
01:04:51,620 --> 01:05:02,940
do we have to leave okay i guess we lost this is they're the
losers we have every winner there is a loser i thought we

1202
01:05:02,940 --> 01:05:04,720
were gonna win um

1203
01:05:08,340 --> 01:05:15,180
oh my gosh you know like when they did the year of luigi
like nintendo ended up losing so much money for that so they

1204
01:05:15,180 --> 01:05:23,300

their worst financial year ever because that's the damn

1205
01:05:23,300 --> 01:05:30,720

Okay.

1403
01:15:22,490 --> 01:15:24,490
I'm trying to knock them out.

1404
01:15:25,930 --> 01:15:27,430
Tripp, are you knocking them out?

1405
01:15:28,250 --> 01:15:29,330
Of course I am.

1406
01:15:30,810 --> 01:15:32,010
I got the bomb.

1407
01:15:32,070 --> 01:15:33,290
I splashed it with the bomb.

1408
01:15:33,310 --> 01:15:33,870
My point.

1426
01:16:05,040 --> 01:16:05,980
That's all I'm gonna do.

1427
01:16:11,440 --> 01:16:13,900

1428
01:16:15,660 --> 01:16:16,420

enemy team.

01:17:51,990 --> 01:17:53,390
Who's our goalie?

1464
01:17:54,570 --> 01:17:55,570

Oh, my offense, oh, my goalie!

There's no one there!

1472
01:18:10,290 --> 01:18:15,510
The enemy team picked up our shield that they're supposed to
use!

1473
01:18:17,450 --> 01:18:19,760

1489
01:18:44,650 --> 01:18:49,790
See, you say I'm offense, but we got two on the offensive
side, so I have to play defense.

1490
01:18:50,650 --> 01:18:52,790
Wait, we can have two off offense.

1491
01:18:53,730 --> 01:18:55,030
But then we have no defense.

1492
01:18:55,670 --> 01:18:57,030
Oh, wait, what about the other girls?

1493
01:18:57,150 --> 01:18:58,710

Guys, I got some bad news.

1577
01:22:42,850 --> 01:22:43,930
They only need one more.

Oh, guys, guys.

1579
01:22:45,810 --> 01:22:47,550
Surely, surely we can come back.

01:22:47,690 --> 01:22:48,950
It's a comeback right here, right?

1581
01:22:49,370 --> 01:22:49,490
Surely.

1582
01:22:49,990 --> 01:22:50,290
Okay.

1583
01:22:50,550 --> 01:22:51,930
They're just getting hard bullied, though.

1584
01:22:52,670 --> 01:22:53,250
It's a comeback.

1585
01:22:53,330 --> 01:22:53,770
It's a comeback.

1586
01:22:54,830 --> 01:22:55,970
It's so winnable.

1587
01:22:56,350 --> 01:22:57,210
It's so winnable.

1588
01:22:57,690 --> 01:22:58,990
It's the comeback of the century.

1589
01:23:00,330 --> 01:23:00,930
This is it.

1590
01:23:01,550 --> 01:23:03,770
Oh, shit.

1591
01:23:04,050 --> 01:23:04,710
Our goalie's down.

1592
01:23:04,990 --> 01:23:05,970
Our goalie's down.

1593
01:23:07,910 --> 01:23:08,190
Okay.

1594
01:23:08,930 --> 01:23:10,070
Oh, I'm down.

1595
01:23:10,390 --> 01:23:10,570
Ow.

1596
01:23:10,930 --> 01:23:11,170
Oh,

1597
01:23:20,470 --> 01:23:22,570
this is just a round robin.

1598
01:23:22,710 --> 01:23:24,630
We're not last because we won our one game.

1599
01:23:25,010 --> 01:23:25,590
That's automatic.

1600
01:23:26,350 --> 01:23:26,570
That's true.

1601
01:23:26,710 --> 01:23:27,450
We're not last.

1602
01:23:27,750 --> 01:23:28,690
We're not last.

1603
01:23:29,450 --> 01:23:31,570
Does that mean we progress or are we out?

1604
01:23:33,270 --> 01:23:35,010
So then we have seated after this.

1605
01:23:36,170 --> 01:23:38,310
Then it's like single elimination.

1606
01:23:39,170 --> 01:23:39,570
I think.

1607
01:23:40,710 --> 01:23:42,610
It's single elimination after this.

1608
01:23:43,350 --> 01:23:43,730
Which is good.

1609
01:23:44,370 --> 01:23:47,030
We purposely lost so we can get easier games.

1610
01:23:47,370 --> 01:23:48,470
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1611
01:23:49,370 --> 01:23:50,970
Adoki, I have some bad news for you.

1612
01:23:51,030 --> 01:23:52,190
That's not how cheating works.

1613
01:23:53,950 --> 01:23:59,410
If you're lashed, that means you go against, that means you
go against top seed, which means you go against the hardest.

1614
01:23:59,610 --> 01:24:02,130
No, that's not how that works.

1615
01:24:03,270 --> 01:24:03,850
No way.

1616
01:24:04,050 --> 01:24:05,470
That's how that works, actually.

1617
01:24:05,850 --> 01:24:06,290
No, no.

1618
01:24:06,530 --> 01:24:07,990
Where did you get those rules?

1619
01:24:08,170 --> 01:24:09,210
Who told you that?

1620
01:24:09,590 --> 01:24:10,730
I was your pro player.

1621
01:24:10,870 --> 01:24:15,750
Who told you, you were a pro player but it's- you were a pro
player.

1622
01:24:15,990 --> 01:24:17,790
But thing, times have changed.

1623
01:24:18,610 --> 01:24:19,590
Times have not changed.

1624
01:24:19,890 --> 01:24:21,110
Maybe in the V2 video world.

1625
01:24:21,270 --> 01:24:22,630
But this is the Twitch rivals.

1626
01:24:24,430 --> 01:24:25,530
This is the Twitch rivals.

1627
01:24:26,090 --> 01:24:27,230
It's not V2 exclusive.

1628
01:24:28,190 --> 01:24:33,070
Okay, but like why would they put us in the, why would they
put us in a harder queues?

1629
01:24:33,070 --> 01:24:41,630
wake up to reality nothing goes right in this accursed world
no but things are supposed to go right things supposed to be

1630
01:24:41,630 --> 01:24:53,990
our world crying emoji okay all right how is the seating
where okay second stage single elimination best of three

1631
01:24:53,990 --> 01:25:04,890
games first to three points oh it's first to three points oh
okay uh wait but it doesn't even even tell oh i think it's

1632
01:25:04,890 --> 01:25:13,230

Yeah, they like recently...

1649
01:26:26,610 --> 01:26:32,470
They recently sold Neopets to some tech guy who is like a
Neopets fan.

1650
01:26:33,310 --> 01:26:35,650
Yeah, like, it's actually like doing stuff.

1651
01:26:35,870 --> 01:26:39,650
Yeah, they're rebuilding the, uh, they're rebuilding the...

1652
01:26:39,650 --> 01:26:41,570
Does it still look like it was made in 2001?

1653
01:26:42,130 --> 01:26:43,070
No, it's...

1654
01:26:43,070 --> 01:26:43,350
Yes.

1655
01:26:43,790 --> 01:26:44,510
Well, okay.

1656
01:26:45,210 --> 01:26:47,530
It looks like it was made in, like, 2012.

1657
01:26:48,550 --> 01:26:49,010
Huh.

1658
01:26:49,350 --> 01:26:51,090
They upgraded it a little bit.

1659
01:26:51,430 --> 01:26:51,910
Huh.

1660
01:26:55,030 --> 01:26:55,510
Right.

1661
01:26:55,710 --> 01:26:59,390
I know, like, I know they're trying to do, like,
something...

1662
01:27:00,330 --> 01:27:00,810
Uh...

1663
01:27:00,810 --> 01:27:02,870
I know they're trying to do, like...

1664
01:27:03,070 --> 01:27:06,130
some updates to it and adding new game modes.

1665
01:27:06,150 --> 01:27:06,990
Yeah, now they're doing a lot.

1666
01:27:07,070 --> 01:27:09,070
And like, they're doing events and stuff finally.

1667
01:27:09,910 --> 01:27:13,330
And they brought back unconverted pets, which is amazing.

1668
01:27:13,570 --> 01:27:14,850
Oh, yeah, I remember that.

1669
01:27:16,470 --> 01:27:17,250
I remember that.

1670
01:27:17,310 --> 01:27:20,510
Because they send like a fucking newsletter out to everybody
about it.

1671
01:27:20,530 --> 01:27:20,870
Yeah.

1672
01:27:21,650 --> 01:27:25,830
I'm autistic enough that I cried when they brought back a
unconverted pet.

1673
01:27:25,830 --> 01:27:30,170
Yeah, because then you can like, you people were like
selling it for like crazy amount of real money.

1674
01:27:30,190 --> 01:27:31,850
It was like hundreds of dollars.

1675
01:27:32,010 --> 01:27:35,510
If you could get a Pokemon, or Pokemon and a Neopet with
like a good name.

1676
01:27:35,630 --> 01:27:37,390
It was genuinely hundreds of dollars.

1677
01:27:40,570 --> 01:27:41,170
It was like, yeah.

1678
01:27:41,230 --> 01:27:47,150
And I remember like you can actually buy like real Neopoints
and like real paintbrushes like and stuff with real fucking

1679
01:27:47,150 --> 01:27:47,710
money.

1680
01:27:49,970 --> 01:27:51,390
Wait, do you actually cry?

1681
01:27:52,350 --> 01:27:53,990
Yeah, no, because I'm autistic.

1682
01:27:56,970 --> 01:27:58,030
That wasn't a joke.

1683
01:27:58,290 --> 01:28:01,610
I was just, you know, you know, I got us fairy sweet hug.

1684
01:28:03,330 --> 01:28:16,270
was really happy okay I was living a really good life yeah I
miss Neopets I used to like grind that game as if it was a

1685
01:28:16,270 --> 01:28:23,110

like that was my life and all oh yeah when I was young I had

1686
01:28:23,110 --> 01:28:31,930
like yeah my did I did Neopet dailies just like how people
today do get do Genshin dailies and Han Kai yeah yeah no I

1687
01:28:31,930 --> 01:28:33,890
did that when I was a When I was a child.

1688
01:28:33,990 --> 01:28:35,630
Yeah, I stopped when I became an adult.

1689
01:28:35,810 --> 01:28:37,050
Sunny Neo or something.

1690
01:28:37,750 --> 01:28:38,030
Sunny Neo!

1691
01:28:38,030 --> 01:28:42,010
And then they would have like a checklist of like, here's
some stuff you have to do every day.

1692
01:28:42,070 --> 01:28:46,790
And then I would click every link every day to make sure I
get my dailies done.

1693
01:28:47,830 --> 01:28:48,870
Yeah, Pets was my gotcha.

1694
01:28:49,110 --> 01:28:50,090
Yes, but it was free.

1695
01:28:51,250 --> 01:28:52,890
The only time I was spending was...

1696
01:28:52,890 --> 01:28:54,670
The only thing I was spending was my time.

1697
01:28:57,290 --> 01:28:58,090
Time is...

1698
01:28:58,090 --> 01:28:59,410
Time is money.

1699
01:28:59,670 --> 01:29:01,930
I was not spending actual money.

1700
01:29:03,970 --> 01:29:13,150
I didn't get scammed into doing the whole what was it in the
the neopets exclusive shit Doki is just hurting my feelings

01:30:50,310 --> 01:30:50,770

1735
01:30:50,950 --> 01:30:51,750
The quarterfinals.

1736
01:30:52,370 --> 01:30:53,890
Who played against these people?

1737
01:30:54,250 --> 01:30:55,150
Zuri Sparks.

1738
01:30:55,490 --> 01:30:56,550
No, they're all new people.

1739
01:30:56,770 --> 01:30:56,910
Nice.

1740
01:30:57,010 --> 01:30:58,390
Alright, if we lose this, we're out.

1741
01:30:58,750 --> 01:30:59,770
Just so you guys know.

1742
01:31:01,950 --> 01:31:03,050
It is lovely.

1743
01:31:03,070 --> 01:31:04,730
Life or death, for real.

1744
01:31:05,830 --> 01:31:07,950
It won't feel so good, Mr. Crows.

1745
01:31:07,970 --> 01:31:08,970
It's life or death.

1746
01:31:10,810 --> 01:31:11,690
Right here.

1747
01:31:12,230 --> 01:31:13,370
Wait, it is not showing up.

1748
01:31:13,650 --> 01:31:13,970
You're right.

1749
01:31:14,210 --> 01:31:14,790
Yeah, it's not.

1750
01:31:14,930 --> 01:31:15,730
I thought you were lying.

1751
01:31:15,990 --> 01:31:16,390
Right now.

1752
01:31:17,170 --> 01:31:18,750
Why would I be lying?

1753
01:31:18,870 --> 01:31:20,230
I thought you were lying about this.

1754
01:31:20,470 --> 01:31:21,430
Compulsive liar.

1755
01:31:21,730 --> 01:31:25,110
I know, because you're about your resume, so...

1756
01:31:25,810 --> 01:31:26,590
I'm sorry.

1757
01:31:26,730 --> 01:31:29,930
You saw that first round, I carried at least two things to
that.

1758
01:31:29,930 --> 01:31:31,890
Did we see that second and third round?

1759
01:31:33,070 --> 01:31:37,870
I think that was, you know, I'm just being held back, you
know, I'm not...

1760
01:31:39,210 --> 01:31:40,970
Name names right now!

1761
01:31:41,070 --> 01:31:41,750
Who is it?

1762
01:31:42,070 --> 01:31:47,870
Uh, you know, I don't really want to, but, you know, not to
cause any drama, but, you know, I'm just saying that I'm not

1763
01:31:47,870 --> 01:31:53,310
being, like, let, like, you know, show my true, you know,
skill in this game.

1764
01:31:57,670 --> 01:31:58,630
All right.

1765
01:31:58,950 --> 01:32:00,970
Why is it not showing up?

1766
01:32:01,050 --> 01:32:02,170
I want to join.

1767
01:32:03,890 --> 01:32:15,230
I want to be part still not created yet oh we okay team
squeaks and team Joe are against each other so if we win

1768
01:32:15,230 --> 01:32:25,070
this we might have to go against Joe again Joe mama okay
that's weird I haven't seen it yet all right somebody sent

1769
01:32:25,070 --> 01:32:35,790
this guy a friend or friend ID and I will invite you and
then breathe you you give your ID there and then invite us.

1770
01:32:35,790 --> 01:32:35,790
Okay.

1771
01:32:37,550 --> 01:32:37,710
Copy.

1772
01:32:38,170 --> 01:32:38,910
What's going on?

1773
01:32:38,990 --> 01:32:45,370
Oh, apparently the room is not showable, so like they have
to invite us individually with the friend ID.

1774
01:32:47,070 --> 01:32:47,330
What the?

1775
01:32:50,770 --> 01:32:52,110
So we're just gotta wait.

1776
01:32:53,630 --> 01:32:54,630
Just gotta wait.

1777
01:32:56,810 --> 01:32:58,430
The first one to die is dead weight.

1778
01:33:01,610 --> 01:33:03,570
Alright, everyone make sure Doki Doki.

1779
01:33:03,850 --> 01:33:03,970
What?

1780
01:33:05,650 --> 01:33:06,810
I'm the captain.

1781
01:33:07,110 --> 01:33:08,350
I can't beat Deadweight.

1782
01:33:08,970 --> 01:33:09,910
I literally...

1783
01:33:09,910 --> 01:33:11,510
Captains are usually the Deadweight.

1784
01:33:11,550 --> 01:33:12,750
I literally scored.

1785
01:33:13,190 --> 01:33:19,490
Captains are usually supposed to just be the charismatic
person to bring people together, not to actually do

1786
01:33:19,490 --> 01:33:19,890
anything.

1787
01:33:20,110 --> 01:33:21,350
It's like a CEO.

1788
01:33:22,850 --> 01:33:23,150
Okay.

1789
01:33:23,450 --> 01:33:23,710
Okay.

1790
01:33:23,850 --> 01:33:25,450
But I actually did stuff.

1791
01:33:27,450 --> 01:33:28,830
Keep telling yourself that.

1792
01:33:28,930 --> 01:33:29,150
Oh, yeah.

1793
01:33:29,150 --> 01:33:29,810
The first game.

1794
01:33:29,870 --> 01:33:30,470
The first game.

1795
01:33:30,530 --> 01:33:32,730
I scored almost all the goals in the first game.

1796
01:33:32,750 --> 01:33:41,690
game the second game i scored the second game i scored the
only goal in the second game that was luck i also kicked it

1797
01:33:41,690 --> 01:33:49,450
forward i knocked two people out i knocked two people oh
yeah game three i set up the goal for you i knocked two

1798
01:33:49,450 --> 01:33:55,450
people out before you set it up see this is the
self-centered thinking we're talking about here this is team

1799
01:33:55,450 --> 01:33:59,730
games but you're only thinking about what yeah but you're
self-centered as well because you were telling people that

1800
01:33:59,730 --> 01:34:06,670
you did all that stuff as well 80% of the team blasts which
rivals my story matters

1801
01:34:14,310 --> 01:34:26,470
What what is a friend ID um is in your fucking profile in
party hours Are they just waiting for us?

1802

1803
01:34:28,730 --> 01:34:30,130

fuck I don't know oh it's because you didn't put the space

1826
01:36:08,260 --> 01:36:12,160
dash oh That makes sense.

1827
01:36:12,160 --> 01:36:13,780
I just flipped the jar and I couldn't find it.

So that's on there.

1830
01:36:16,460 --> 01:36:18,700

All right.

1839
01:36:32,060 --> 01:36:33,640
Whoever dies first is a dead weight.

Hey, guys.

1951
01:41:28,100 --> 01:41:30,480
I think, look, I got my one.

1952
01:41:30,620 --> 01:41:32,780
I got my, guys, I got my one.

1953
01:41:32,860 --> 01:41:41,560
what were you guys doing who got their ones uh i got my five
i got you did not get five only two people fucking died in

1954
01:41:41,560 --> 01:41:53,760
that tired time you missed my clutch guardian angel save no
that was amazing i did yeah but you guys died regardless of

1955
01:41:53,760 --> 01:41:59,920
what does it matter listen what's more important in life
saving someone or killing someone that's what i thought well

1956
01:41:59,920 --> 01:42:08,820
if that person you're uh like going to jail anyway for
committing murder then like killing them is a better deal

1957
01:42:08,820 --> 01:42:14,660
you heard it here doki thinks murder is justifiable yeah if
you're murdering another murderer

1958
01:42:21,190 --> 01:42:27,050
if that person is if that person is about to commit multiple
murders and you murdered them before they commit multiple

1959
01:42:27,050 --> 01:42:34,070
murders then it's justifiable it's okay what if that person
was about what if that person was about to murder someone

1960
01:42:34,070 --> 01:42:45,350
who their child well what if that child grows up to commit
more murders and he was like a time traveler yeah i think

1961
01:42:45,350 --> 01:42:51,130
that's sound logic yeah that makes sense it should make
sense you heard it here doki said it's fine to murder

1962
01:42:51,130 --> 01:43:00,710
children so they don't no no no no no no no no no no no no
no no no i'm saying that child and we should kill all the

1963
01:43:00,710 --> 01:43:08,150
children before they do anything therefore There will be no
problems The murderer was a time traveler Who knows the

1964
01:43:08,150 --> 01:43:13,110
future What that child is going to do It's like if you have
the power of time travel We travel You know how your logic

1965
01:43:13,110 --> 01:43:18,330
is flawed You know how your logic is flawed Because if
there's time travel It would already happen by now Yeah

1966
01:43:18,330 --> 01:43:24,150
because it's a paradox What if they created a multiverse So
that it drifts off to a separate multiverse?

1967
01:43:24,230 --> 01:43:32,810
Multiverse I love marble Yeah Someone pull the trigger I'm
going in deep Go go in the bomb Oh no I'm stuck I'll just

01:43:32,810 --> 01:43:35,090

I had a fun time with everyone.

2084
01:49:37,830 --> 01:49:42,810
It was honestly a huge blast playing with this team.

2085
01:49:43,050 --> 01:49:45,070
And oh yeah, I just had a fun time with this team as well.

There's been some...

2087
01:49:47,290 --> 01:49:50,790
I feel like on Twitch, things just get much more cursed in
general.

2088
01:49:53,010 --> 01:49:55,250
It's just the Twitch life.

2089
01:49:59,250 --> 01:50:00,210
Anyway, guys.

2090
01:50:00,410 --> 01:50:01,630
Um, it's okay.

2091
01:50:01,790 --> 01:50:03,150
We won our first game.

2092
01:50:03,410 --> 01:50:04,490
That's all that matters.

2093
01:50:04,790 --> 01:50:10,090
Guys, it's all about the adventures and the fun we had along
the whole way.

2094
01:50:13,510 --> 01:50:14,490
Hey, guys.

2095
01:50:14,690 --> 01:50:17,390
Uh, we do have another stream tonight, everybody.

2096
01:50:18,330 --> 01:50:22,050
Um, look, I was not the dead weight.

2097
01:50:22,310 --> 01:50:24,990
I, I did some clutch shit.

2098
01:50:25,490 --> 01:50:26,590
That's all I'm saying.

2099
01:50:30,530 --> 01:50:33,190
I pulled off my ones.

2100
01:50:33,630 --> 01:50:35,430
I did my ones, okay?

2101
01:50:35,810 --> 01:50:39,890
I defended so well during the trebuchet moment.

2102
01:50:41,210 --> 01:50:48,190
I fucking defended it so hard during the trebuchet and,
like, sent bombs over and everything.

2103
01:50:48,870 --> 01:50:50,210
Like, bro, come on.

2104
01:50:51,950 --> 01:50:53,290
I went full.

2105
01:50:53,490 --> 01:50:55,390
I fucking beat up the goalie.

2106
01:50:55,810 --> 01:50:59,030
And I scored, like, four goals.

2107
01:50:59,570 --> 01:51:00,290
Like...

2108
01:51:00,410 --> 01:51:17,690
all you did is punch the gold and that and i did my one i
did my one okay um and i sent the bombs over what they did

2109
01:51:17,690 --> 01:51:26,210
with the bombs was their job like i sent the bombs over they
had to finish the job

2110
01:51:30,410 --> 01:51:34,310
I did my 50% of the work.

2111
01:51:38,530 --> 01:51:41,510
I was sending bombs out.

2112
01:51:42,330 --> 01:51:49,170
I did, okay, that is not true, sure for at best, I was the
80% at that point.

2113
01:51:54,490 --> 01:51:59,350
Look, all I'm saying was that, no, no, no, no, no.

2114
01:52:00,410 --> 01:52:02,410
90% in that one game we won?

2115
01:52:03,410 --> 01:52:04,170
Huh, sure, poor?

2116
01:52:04,490 --> 01:52:07,970
Were you the 90% on that one game we won?

2117
01:52:09,150 --> 01:52:10,010
Where was the defending?

2118
01:52:10,130 --> 01:52:11,390
That was Bree's job!

2119
01:52:12,050 --> 01:52:13,090
Bree was the defender!

2120
01:52:13,890 --> 01:52:16,330
I was fucking sending bombs over!

2121
01:52:16,910 --> 01:52:26,050
I was carrying the bombs over and then I sent it over and
then I and then Bree had to do the defense for the other

2122
01:52:26,050 --> 01:52:26,590
bombs.

2123
01:52:27,130 --> 01:52:30,210
Mr. Lane Robbins was the carry.

2124
01:52:30,410 --> 01:52:31,430
What is this?

2125
01:52:31,470 --> 01:52:33,230
