1
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:37,930
Hello, everybody!

2
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:39,850
Hello, hello, hello, hello!

3
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:50,090
I apologize that this is a very, uh, um, a very early stream
for Resident Evil, for Resident Evil 4.

4
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:57,470
Uh, I just want, I wanted to start early today because I was
like, okay, um, if we're doing a long stream, I don't want

5
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:59,570
to get to the scary part when it's nighttime.

6
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:06,270
I want to get to the scary part.

7
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:09,130
When the sun is just going down.

8
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:14,810
So, so that is why.

9
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:17,390
I know it's a different time slot.

10
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:21,410
Compared to, like, the part one of Resident Evil 4.

11
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:25,590
But, like, guys, it is for the sake of my sanity.

12
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:27,670
That we play the game.

13
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:30,050
When it's not that dark.

14
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:34,470
It's not cheating.

15
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:36,330
It's the sun.

16
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:49,030
sky so so that is why we are playing it at an earlier time
slot because like i said i don't want to you know i don't i

17
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:57,190
don't want to get to this like if we're doing long stream
most likely some of the scarier parts happen at a later time

18
00:03:57,190 --> 00:04:05,410
so like you know maybe if i play for like five or six hours
um and it's scary i can look outside and be like oh the sun

19
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:07,810
is still out So, like, this is not real.

20
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:16,670
When it gets dark, I can be like, I'll be like, there's a
possibility this can happen.

21
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:22,230
But when I see that the sun is still out, I'd be like, it's
not real because the sun is still out.

22
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:28,690
H, thank you for the super chat.

23

1230pm slot Because there's no fucking way I'm playing

Have lots of fun, Doki.

42
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:03,280

the VOD or chapter 5 that I make it on time later.

43
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,080
Thank you for the super chat.

44
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:04,800

00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:07,920
Thank you, thank you.

47
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:09,360
All right, here we go.

48
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,220
to melee.

49
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:13,520
I'll figure this out.

50
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:17,560
Condor 1 to roost.

51
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:18,840
Do you read me?

52
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:19,420
Condor 1?

53
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,060
You've been radio silent for three hours.

54
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,360
Are you alright?

55
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,840
Ma'am, I got injected by Coca-Cola bear.

56
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:28,960
Or by Adam Sadler.

57
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,060
I don't know which is worse.

58
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:33,820
Oh, F.

59
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:35,480
I figured it out.

60
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,320
F is melee.

61
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,940
I figured it out, guys.

62
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:50,240
Okay, the only other way I hate playing when the sun is out
is that it makes me realize just how dirty my monitor is

63
00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:01,440
Because when the sign shines just right on your monitor

64
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:17,480
It's too real That's the only thing I hate about When the
sun is out When it's sunshines Just right You can see

65
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:25,000
everything on your I'm gonna fucking give me a sec guys I
need to close my blinds I can't I can't feel like I don't

66
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:34,000
want to see I don't want to see I'll fuck up my monitor in
Alright It's okay, the sun is still shining through my

67
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:34,740
blinds.

68
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:35,680
Because then...

69
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:39,240
There we go.

70
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,680
I feel less guilty now.

71
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,540
Ah, shit, I forgot there was...

72
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:45,320
This was the reason why I stopped playing.

73
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,280
I forgot that this was the reason...

74
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,680
Where the fuck is my map?

75
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:52,620
Okay.

76
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,800
Where do I go?

77
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,860
Okay, I'm gonna go to the dead end?

78
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:58,960
Is this dead end?

79
00:07:58,980 --> 00:07:59,660
This is dead end.

80
00:07:59,740 --> 00:07:59,980
Okay.

81
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,720
There must be, like, loot, right?

82
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:03,520
Oh, wait.

83
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:04,460
What?

84
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:06,340
Oh, no.

85
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:06,920
I'm turning.

86
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:08,060
I'm hearing the voices.

87
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:09,220
Oh, no.

88
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:10,840
I didn't take my meds.

89
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:12,960
Oh, oh.

90
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:16,760
I don't like this.

91
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,880
Come out the bush!

92
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,280
Oh, loot.

93
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:28,080
Oh, this is why I play in the morning!

94
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:29,780
Okay.

95
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:31,060
Oh, I'm lost.

96
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:34,800
Oh, I'm freaking out that I don't even know where to go.

97
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:37,760
I hate this.

98
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:38,440
I hate this.

99
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:40,260
I hate this.

100
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:41,980
I hate this so much.

101
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:43,100
Stop!

102
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,380
I'll never take my...

103
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:46,180
Oh, hey, Barrow.

104
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:48,880
Okay, I need to take the Barrow first.

105
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:50,040
Barrow time.

106
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:51,200
Oh.

107
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:53,020
Oh.

108
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:53,860
Hello?

109
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,660
Oh, the voices are only in that area.

110
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,960
If I close my eyes.

111
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:02,380
Okay, money.

112
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:05,860
Oh, oh, oh, oh, hello?

113
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:07,640
Hello?

114
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,620
Who's there?

115
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:10,800
Whoa, whoa, who's there?

116
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:12,320
Who's there?

117
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:18,240
Oh, I don't like this.

118
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,420
I don't like this at all.

119
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,040
Oh, the voices are back.

120
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,660
The voices are back.

121
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:30,530
Get out of the bush!

122
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:34,070
Oh, no.

123
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:35,730
Oh, no.

124
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:36,970
What are they even saying?

125
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:38,430
Oh, there's the bones.

126
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:40,770
There's the bones.

127
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:43,730
Oh, there they are.

128
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:46,490
Oh.

129
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:53,080
What's going on?

130
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:54,360
What?

131
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:54,820
Oh!

132
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,140
Oh, that's a sniper!

133
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,800
Oh, shit!

134
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,080
Where do I...

135
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:03,540
Dude!

136
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:04,820
The head?

137
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,560
Where do I shoot?

138
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,600
He has no head!

139
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:19,620
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, you have a head though.

140
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:22,860
Oh, god.

141
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:24,760
There you go.

142
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,560
I think that's your head.

143
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:28,500
Oh, what?

144
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,960
Okay, if I shoot the leg.

145
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,520
If I shoot the leg!

146
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:34,140
You can't walk, right?

147
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:55,400

150
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:08,580
That's great.

151
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:11,780
I should have not shot the knees when that thing came out.

152
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:12,920
Alright.

153
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,640
Well, I assume that headshots don't work right now.

154
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:22,420
I assume that headshots do not work on these guys.

155
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:23,820
Craft.

156
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,480
Oh, I don't have enough shotgun.

157
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,600
Wait, do I not have enough?

158
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:28,040
I should have enough.

159
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:28,420
Yeah.

160
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,100
Okay, we're gonna make shotgun shells.

161
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:31,440
We're gonna need it.

162
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:32,160
Alright.

163
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:33,220
They do?

164
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:34,820
Oh, they do work?

165
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:35,460
Oh, okay.

166
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:36,780
So I just keep aiming the head.

167
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:39,560
Alright.

168
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:40,180
Okay.

169
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:41,680
They still have brains in there.

170
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:41,940
Okay.

171
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:42,440
That's good.

172
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,440
I couldn't tell.

173
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:45,620
There were like so many things coming out of the head.

174
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:46,520
I don't know.

175
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:49,360
Maybe there were like mini brains in like various areas.

176
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:51,060
Like what's...

177
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:52,660
I don't know the logic of parasites.

178
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:56,840
Like I don't know the logic of Resident Evil 4 parasites.

179
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:58,460
How would I know?

180
00:11:58,540 --> 00:11:59,860
Because I already killed the brain.

181
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,700
Where are the other brains?

182
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,100
Like where?

183
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,020
Oh.

184
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:06,640
Brains.

185
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,980
Aim for the head tentacles.

186
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:12,440
I don't know that.

187
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:15,060
Are there mini brains in the tentacles?

188
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,900
I don't know.

189
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,760
Am I supposed to assume that?

190
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:25,280
They are weak to...

191
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:25,660
Yeah.

192
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,480
Yeah, but will they die from light?

193
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:34,980
They might be weak to light, but will they won't die from
it?

194
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:35,600
That's the thing.

195
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:37,540
I need Tetris this.

196
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,660
This is like so fucking messy.

197
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,560
Wait, is that a chocolate bar?

198
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,400
What is this?

199
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:44,160
Oh, it's a rifle.

200
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,400
I was like, why do I have a chocolate bar?

201
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:49,860
Okay.

202
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:53,240
Alright, here we go.

203
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,040
Where do I go?

204
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,260
I'm already lost.

205
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,740
Oh, I go...

206
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:00,720
Oh, wait, what?

207
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,140
There was a way over here?

208
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:05,420
Oh.

209
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:14,560
I can barely see it's like the thing I hate is that Leon
doesn't turn on his fucking flashlight like when it's

210
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:27,400

214
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:10,800
Oh yeah, what is this place?

215
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:14,840
Leon eats his carrots.

216
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,200
Fuck carrots.

217
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:18,240
What's carrots done for me?

218
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,880
The shrine of hands.

219
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,280
Girmly grasp it.

220
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:28,680
Is this the hand guy?

221
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:35,610
What the fuck do I put in there?

222
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:37,430
Alright, it's time to figure it out.

223
00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:40,830
Oh god, okay.

224
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:41,650
There's a boat.

225
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:45,250
I don't like this.

226
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:47,770
God, I hate this level so fucking much.

227
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:48,730
Do I put the head?

228
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:51,190
Oh, there's the monster I killed.

229
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:53,310
Oh.

230
00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:54,870
What's in here?

231
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:56,790
Wait, there's treasures?

232
00:14:58,310 --> 00:14:59,850
Oh, there's a lot of treasures.

233
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:02,230
Okay, we're gonna have to go there.

234
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:05,530
And then we have to go there to grab stuff.

235
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:07,990
Oh my god.

236
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:10,930
Why is there a maze-like thing here?

237
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:12,030
I don't like that.

238
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:13,870
Alright, and then...

239
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:15,050
So we go there.

240
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:15,970
And then...

241
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:18,710
Oh, wait, but there's, like, loot in the middle of the lake.

242
00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:20,110
How do I get to the middle?

243
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:22,530
I can't fucking swim, apparently.

244
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:24,390
Wait, is that the right game?

245
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:26,590
Oh, no, all the games are blurring together.

246
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:28,690
No, I can't swim.

247
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:30,090
No, Leon can swim.

248
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:30,710
Never mind.

249
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:35,490
Sorry.

250
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:40,810
All the games are blurring together, because usually I can't
swim.

251
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:47,930
We have to manually drive the boat myself?

252
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:51,110
That's fucked up.

253
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:54,190
Why do I have to drive the boat myself?

254
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:55,690
That's what the game is for.

255
00:15:55,810 --> 00:15:57,090
That's what cutscenes are for.

256
00:15:57,950 --> 00:16:00,550
Are you telling me I don't get the privilege of cutscenes?

257
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:04,690
Okay, someone fetched me a rare golden chicken egg.

258
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:06,170
Oh, shit.

259
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:09,950
Okay, well, time to see if the chickens will lay me an egg.

260
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:12,730
Uh, what's in here?

261
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:14,450
What are you?

262
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:16,510
The old way shrine.

263
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:18,010
What door does this open?

264
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:19,830
All the locations are in.

265
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:23,390
I can't remember, man.

266
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:30,090
Wait, I do have to drive the boat!

267
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:30,830
What?

268
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:34,110
Where's my cutscene privileges?

269
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:39,570
Oh no, I have to throw the fucking spear too?

270
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:42,230
God damn!

271
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:44,410
I'm so sad!

272
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:46,550
There's no cutscene privileges!

273
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:50,030
I have to do this all by hand!

274
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:51,710
Boop!

275
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:53,870
I guess I'll grab that $100.

276
00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:56,130
Oh, it's $100 now.

277
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:58,450
I remember when barrels were a thousand.

278
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:00,470
Inflation happened.

279
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:04,870
Do you remember?

280
00:17:05,830 --> 00:17:07,230
Okay, isn't that the boat?

281
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:08,930
Oh, this was the boat.

282
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:10,050
Oh, okay.

283
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:12,210
How do we get into this boat?

284
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:15,470
How the hell do I get on this boat?

285
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:16,790
Hello?

286
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:18,030
Oh, here.

287
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:20,950

No, that is Alexandrite.

292
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:29,910
Gun?

293
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:34,070

294
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:38,610

00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:40,070

Wait, why the fuck is...

309
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,000

Time to lay some egg.

00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:04,900
Time to lay some golden eggs.

337
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:07,160

Sorry, that's actually a waste of bullets.

00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,660
You're not worth my time.

00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,540
You can't say that.

360
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:19,860
Okay.

361
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:21,080
Oh, wait, wait.

363
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,220
Why do I even need to use my fucking thing?

364
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:26,900
I can just ram into it.

365
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:30,080
You can't say that unless you're vegan or vegetarian.

366
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:30,900
Okay.

367
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:41,640
If you're neither of these you can't say that Because you
you've eaten KFC before

368
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:59,060
Don't think I don't know There you Not that Where do you
think fucking fried chicken comes from Chicken

369
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:06,940

Alright, here you go.

shink somebody.

384
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:05,740
That was, that was an oopsie there.

385
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:13,460

quick time prompt and i chose to ignore it because i thought

time prompt uh light there you go i legitimately thought i

416
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:22,880
worth it that's money three years ago my beloved daughter
passed away shortly after giving birth to a son since then

417
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:31,000
the boy has grown considerably he's a very curious child and
has a true thirst for knowledge he even tries to um follow

418
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:35,220
after me when i go out hunting I can't take my eyes off him
for a second.

419
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:39,260
Whenever we walk in the forest, he always asks me to tell
stories.

420
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:41,000
He's very fond of Don.

421
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:45,860
Although he's small, the boy is smart and observant beyond
his years.

422
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:49,000
If he weren't stuck here, he might become a scholar.

423
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:51,140
I was a careless fool.

424
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:56,080
I could have sworn I shot clean through the wolf's head, and
yet it lunged at me.

425
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,540
I was able to make it back to the cabin.

426
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:01,240
But my wound is swollen and discolored.

427
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:04,600
Seeing the boy's worried eyes.

428
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,700
My body moves on its own.

429
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:10,580
Oh no, he got infected by the bad woes.

430
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:11,900
Oh no!

431
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:15,620
My boy moves on its own.

432
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,200
My body, am I going mad?

433
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:19,300
I can't die now and leave the boy behind.

434
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:22,240
Dear God, please protect him.

435
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:23,300

00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,600

Oh, my God.

I feel so much paranoia right now.

485
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:26,170
I don't feel safe.

486
00:32:27,490 --> 00:32:27,790
Wait.

487
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:29,090

00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:33,190
Wait, where is that?

492
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:44,890

I'm so paranoid.

504
00:33:09,190 --> 00:33:11,590
There's so much paranoia here.

505
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:14,310
I shouldn't feel this safe.

506
00:33:14,770 --> 00:33:16,930
I don't feel safe at all.

507
00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:18,490

00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,120
Okay, I did not like Super Wolf.

535
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:05,880
I did not like Super Wolf at all.

536
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:12,380
Super Wolf did not make me comfortable.

537
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:15,920
All right, let's craft some more shotgun shells here.

538
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:17,080
All right, nice.

539
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:20,040
We'll just eat an egg.

540
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,480
We have so many eggs.

541
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:23,280

00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:29,460
Can't decide if I want to protect you or bully you.

546
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:31,980

561
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,260

This does not feel like the safe cave.

00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:24,500
It feels like the bait cave.

00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:42,720
Every time there's a little hole, there's loot.

791
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:44,540
Nice money.

792
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:48,160
I'll never be as rich as I was before.

793
00:50:48,980 --> 00:50:50,480
I felt so strong.

794
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:52,360

00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:00,940

I'll be fast enough.

804
00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:11,900
I'll be fast enough.

805
00:51:12,020 --> 00:51:13,060
Okay, I'm fast enough this time.

806
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:18,080

00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:28,340
Not nice.

812
00:51:28,580 --> 00:51:30,240
That is a fucking bomb.

813
00:51:31,260 --> 00:51:32,880
I didn't have time to shoot it.

814
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:34,420
It's okay.

815
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:35,600

832
00:52:44,980 --> 00:52:47,180
Oh, wait.

833
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:47,780
Is that it?

834
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:49,400
No.

835
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:49,960
Oh, my God.

836
00:52:50,060 --> 00:52:51,240
I don't need rifle ammo!

837
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:53,960
Hello?

838
00:52:55,540 --> 00:52:56,000
Right away.

839
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:56,940
Thank you for the super chat.

840
00:52:57,080 --> 00:52:57,460
Thank you.

841
00:52:57,720 --> 00:52:58,020
Thank you.

842
00:52:59,060 --> 00:52:59,320
Hello?

843
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:02,240
Okay, what do I need to do?

844
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:05,920
All right, there's treasure here, and then there's a shrine
here.

845
00:53:06,740 --> 00:53:07,180
Okay.

846
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:08,860
Where do I go?

847
00:53:09,580 --> 00:53:10,440
Is this a rifle?

848
00:53:10,660 --> 00:53:11,960
No, this is a waste.

849
00:53:12,100 --> 00:53:13,720
Rifle is for bosses only.

850
00:53:14,460 --> 00:53:16,040
These guys are too small.

851
00:53:17,180 --> 00:53:17,220
Okay.

852
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:19,060
These guys are not worth it.

853
00:53:19,580 --> 00:53:19,880
Are you...

854
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:20,640
Are they a boss?

855
00:53:20,740 --> 00:53:21,060
No.

856
00:53:21,620 --> 00:53:24,120
I am trying to set a presidency here.

857
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:24,560
Okay?

858
00:53:24,940 --> 00:53:26,300
They need to know their worth.

859
00:53:26,980 --> 00:53:28,260
And they are not worth rifles.

860
00:53:34,040 --> 00:53:34,840
They are not...

861
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:35,360
They are...

862
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:38,440
Dude, they are not worth rifle privileges.

863
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:44,640
Not everybody deserves to be a rifle.

864
00:53:45,700 --> 00:53:46,480
What the fuck?

865
00:53:49,020 --> 00:53:49,500
What?

866
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:49,620
What?

867
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:52,200
Oh, shit, there he is.

868
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:53,460
I was like, what?

869
00:53:58,010 --> 00:53:58,770
I'm so...

870
00:53:58,770 --> 00:54:00,150
Oh, what the fuck?

871
00:54:00,250 --> 00:54:01,390
Where did you get here?

872
00:54:04,330 --> 00:54:05,010
Oh, God.

873
00:54:05,110 --> 00:54:05,970
I don't like this.

874
00:54:06,170 --> 00:54:06,430
Whoa!

875
00:54:10,050 --> 00:54:11,410
I don't like this.

876
00:54:12,870 --> 00:54:14,030
I don't like this.

877
00:54:16,870 --> 00:54:17,750
Mr. Gremlin!

878
00:54:18,690 --> 00:54:19,010
Oh, wait.

879
00:54:19,050 --> 00:54:19,690
I can't reload.

880
00:54:26,820 --> 00:54:27,660
No, no.

01:17:35,850 --> 01:17:38,350
Wait, how big are these fishes supposed to be?

1242

How big are these fishes supposed to be?

1243

I can't believe it.

1253
01:18:33,630 --> 01:18:36,770
An hour and 20 minutes, and now we're progressing the story.

1254
01:18:42,830 --> 01:18:45,150
Now, now we're progressing.

01:18:48,150 --> 01:18:49,710

01:19:22,610 --> 01:19:23,850
It makes no difference.

1261
01:19:24,230 --> 01:19:24,810
The price.

1262
01:19:24,850 --> 01:19:26,030
Okay, here we go.

1263
01:19:26,410 --> 01:19:27,490
That's our choice.

You've proven yourself.

You're an explosive friend.

1269
01:19:37,170 --> 01:19:39,030
Look, he made that comment.

1270
01:19:39,470 --> 01:19:41,330
I'm just curious what he meant.

1271
01:19:42,910 --> 01:19:47,430
I want to take care of any leftover errands before going
this way.

1272
01:19:47,950 --> 01:19:50,410
Be ashamed to live the rest of your life.

1273
01:19:53,270 --> 01:19:54,590
I already did everything.

1274
01:19:54,670 --> 01:19:56,310
Oh, it's like a hint to be like this is.

1275
01:19:56,390 --> 01:19:57,450
You won't come back here.

1325
01:22:43,200 --> 01:22:44,280
Guys, this is it, guys.

1326
01:22:45,320 --> 01:22:47,640
This is what the rifle was for!

1327
01:22:50,720 --> 01:22:51,720
This is it!

1328
01:22:51,920 --> 01:22:52,720

01:24:33,240 --> 01:24:35,660
Rifle is for bosses only.

1359
01:24:38,360 --> 01:24:39,680
That's almost a pancake.

1360
01:24:40,280 --> 01:24:43,080
This is why I didn't use my rifle.

1361
01:24:43,660 --> 01:24:44,380
Let's get to that church.

1362
01:24:45,500 --> 01:24:47,840
Rifle is for bosses only.

01:24:47,940 --> 01:24:48,220

We need more rifle ammo though.

1374
01:25:06,480 --> 01:25:09,840
We are actually lacking now in the rifle department.

1375
01:25:10,380 --> 01:25:11,060

Oh, yeah, his little home.

1384
01:25:57,120 --> 01:25:58,560
There must be stuff in here, right?

1385
01:25:59,480 --> 01:26:00,940
Wait, is this like...

1386
01:26:01,760 --> 01:26:03,060
Wait, did I come from here?

1387
01:26:03,120 --> 01:26:04,100
No, I came from here.

1388
01:26:04,180 --> 01:26:05,120
Where is your house?

1389
01:26:05,820 --> 01:26:06,420
Is it here?

1390
01:26:07,740 --> 01:26:09,380
Yeah, this is where you live, right?

1391
01:26:11,600 --> 01:26:12,460
Six months.

1392
01:26:13,140 --> 01:26:17,920
Its teeth have only just come through, but it shows
everything within it.

1393
01:26:17,940 --> 01:26:19,140
reached into his mouth.

1394
01:26:19,720 --> 01:26:22,780
It can't walk yet, but it swallowed a dog hole.

1395
01:26:23,300 --> 01:26:27,800
Nine months, it already towers over me, but it keeps
growing.

1396
01:26:28,900 --> 01:26:31,280
The town hall can no longer contain it.

1397
01:26:31,780 --> 01:26:33,880
Ten months, it keeps growing.

1398
01:26:34,400 --> 01:26:40,240
Even after moving to the quarry, it can devour a whole cow
in only three days.

1399
01:26:40,640 --> 01:26:44,280
It can swing our largest pig ass as if it were a twig.

1400
01:26:44,940 --> 01:26:54,440
One of the men of the village was almost eaten today, it's
not getting enough food 17 months there are only a few cows

Here we go.

1448
01:30:03,160 --> 01:30:04,020

01:30:12,230 --> 01:30:12,690
Nice.

1451
01:30:13,830 --> 01:30:15,370
This is a well-designed church.

1452
01:30:16,030 --> 01:30:17,950
This is where all the villagers' money went into.

1453
01:30:19,350 --> 01:30:20,070
Hello!

1454
01:30:21,110 --> 01:30:21,810

01:30:21,810 --> 01:30:23,410
It's this puzzle!

1456
01:30:25,330 --> 01:30:26,590
I know this puzzle.

1457
01:30:27,930 --> 01:30:29,530
We have to align this thing.

1458
01:30:30,590 --> 01:30:32,490
Look for Ashley in the church.

1459
01:30:34,230 --> 01:30:34,950
Uh...

1460
01:30:35,830 --> 01:30:36,910

1461
01:30:39,730 --> 01:30:40,930
Wait, I can unlock the door.

1462
01:30:41,650 --> 01:30:41,830
Okay.

1463
01:30:42,830 --> 01:30:43,190

1464
01:30:49,260 --> 01:30:50,120
Puzzle time.

1465
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:54,360
Okay.

1466
01:30:55,140 --> 01:30:56,620
Wait, but what about the other button?

1467
01:30:58,000 --> 01:30:58,700
Is there another button?

1468
01:31:00,160 --> 01:31:02,260
Oh, maybe the... Oh, wait.

1469
01:31:03,240 --> 01:31:03,600
Vaults.

1470
01:31:03,700 --> 01:31:04,100
What the fuck?

1471
01:31:04,180 --> 01:31:04,840
I don't have an arrow.

1472
01:31:04,940 --> 01:31:06,040
I don't have a thing there.

1473
01:31:09,900 --> 01:31:11,320
Do I need to...

1474
01:31:12,080 --> 01:31:13,580
Do I need to find the other button?

1475
01:31:13,680 --> 01:31:14,320
I don't remember.

1476
01:31:15,660 --> 01:31:16,240
Oh, hey.

1477
01:31:16,480 --> 01:31:17,160
Why are these...

1478
01:31:17,580 --> 01:31:19,920
I like how they're all the ammo I don't need.

1479
01:31:22,540 --> 01:31:24,840
I don't have any of those guns!

1480
01:31:25,040 --> 01:31:26,380
Where are you trying to say?

1481
01:31:27,480 --> 01:31:28,440
Oh, there you go.

1482
01:31:28,520 --> 01:31:29,280
There's the blue dial.

Nice.

1484
01:31:30,260 --> 01:31:31,080

Okay, we're gonna figure this out.

1491
01:31:48,720 --> 01:31:50,800

Does this man know I'm here?

1765
01:52:00,230 --> 01:52:00,870

We can kill him all the way here.

1772
01:52:10,750 --> 01:52:12,630
He still doesn't know he's walking back.

1773
01:52:13,270 --> 01:52:14,130
He's walking back.

1774
01:52:15,470 --> 01:52:16,810
Guys, I don't think he knows.

1775
01:52:16,910 --> 01:52:17,870
He's walking backwards.

1777
01:52:22,670 --> 01:52:23,850

01:52:26,150 --> 01:52:27,210

01:52:28,770 --> 01:52:30,230

From 80 bullets to 20... 20 bullets.

1835
01:55:21,110 --> 01:55:22,030
It was worth it.

01:57:29,170 --> 01:57:32,770
Like, this Ashley is terrible.

1851
01:57:33,330 --> 01:57:36,870
At least OG Ashley, if I tell her to stay, she stays.

1852
01:57:37,610 --> 01:57:38,970
This Ashley does not stay.

1853
01:57:40,570 --> 01:57:43,770
This Ashley does not know the concept of please stand back.

1854
01:57:43,890 --> 01:57:45,010
I have a gun.

1855
01:57:50,390 --> 01:57:50,830
Okay.

1856
01:57:51,070 --> 01:57:52,110
It should be this way.

01:57:54,950 --> 01:57:56,070
Back we go.

1858
01:57:56,590 --> 01:57:56,850

01:57:56,970 --> 01:57:59,430

1860
01:58:02,550 --> 01:58:03,410
Oh my god.

1861
01:58:03,570 --> 01:58:06,650
Oh, can I bring my shotgun just in case we see the super
dog?

1862
01:58:08,470 --> 01:58:11,210
Just in case super dog decides to show up.

1863
01:58:12,010 --> 01:58:12,370
Super dog?

1864
01:58:15,070 --> 01:58:15,990
Super dog.

1865
01:58:17,010 --> 01:58:19,630
We all want to go home, Ashley, but here we are.

1866
01:58:24,900 --> 01:58:25,780
Super dog.

1867
01:58:26,020 --> 01:58:26,720
Where are you?

01:58:30,290 --> 01:58:31,470
We're super dog.

01:58:32,270 --> 01:58:33,590
I don't like that.

1870
01:58:33,910 --> 01:58:36,050
It started making the ambience noise.

1871
01:58:40,150 --> 01:58:40,490
Super dog?

1872
01:58:42,410 --> 01:58:43,810
Is Super dog here?

1873
01:58:45,390 --> 01:58:46,150
Super dog.

1874
01:58:46,690 --> 01:58:48,670
Why is there creepy ambience?

1875
01:58:50,830 --> 01:58:52,090
Where's that treasure?

1876
01:58:52,210 --> 01:58:54,150
Is that... Oh, the savage mud.

1877
01:58:54,310 --> 01:58:55,730
Okay, Super dog is here.

1878
01:58:56,250 --> 01:58:57,310
Alright, Super dog.

1879
01:59:01,680 --> 01:59:04,740
Super dog is apparently here now.

1880
01:59:05,800 --> 01:59:07,880
super dog in the room with us?

1881
01:59:14,710 --> 01:59:15,090
Super dog?

1882
01:59:16,410 --> 01:59:18,170
Where are you?

1883
01:59:21,550 --> 01:59:24,550
Is the treasure, like, upstairs?

1884
01:59:25,870 --> 01:59:27,790
Because I don't remember.

1885
01:59:32,480 --> 01:59:33,340
Super dog?

1886
01:59:34,480 --> 01:59:36,180
Alright, time to save.

1887
01:59:41,340 --> 01:59:41,920
Okay.

1888
01:59:42,760 --> 01:59:44,880
Super dog, I have a shotgun.

1889
01:59:45,280 --> 01:59:47,100
I have a treat for you!

1890
01:59:52,220 --> 01:59:53,380
Where's Superdog?

1891
01:59:55,200 --> 01:59:57,280
I forgot where the treasure is.

1892
01:59:59,760 --> 02:00:02,380
Oh, it's a collapsible ladder!

1893
02:00:02,720 --> 02:00:04,500
This is where Superdog is!

1894
02:00:05,640 --> 02:00:06,420
Got it.

1895
02:00:09,350 --> 02:00:10,650
Alright, here you go.

1896
02:00:17,650 --> 02:00:18,470
Alright, nice.

1897
02:00:19,090 --> 02:00:19,670
Lime up.

1898
02:00:20,910 --> 02:00:22,270
It's called treasure.

1899
02:00:25,390 --> 02:00:36,010
okay all the men cheered and then everyone clapped all the
men cheered when they heard the boat as it raced across the

1900
02:00:36,010 --> 02:00:43,470
surface of the water that magnificent oil will surely help
us catch fish easier than ever before the ironworks was only

1901
02:00:43,470 --> 02:00:50,250
built a year ago but this has already merged well with the
village our sickles and knives shine like never before the

1902
02:00:50,250 --> 02:00:54,530
two fish we got from the deal will eat almost anything and
are breeding well.

1903
02:00:54,930 --> 02:00:58,550
The fish farm in the swamp is also making excellent
progress.

1904
02:00:59,050 --> 02:01:02,370
During the day, I teach literacy and mathematics to the
children.

1905
02:01:02,970 --> 02:01:07,830
Every evening, I dine with a single family to hear their
grievances and recent gossip.

1906
02:01:08,390 --> 02:01:11,650
All under the roof of this home we built.

1907
02:01:12,290 --> 02:01:17,370
Since I opened up the village to the outside, we have
prospered and the people are happier.

1908
02:01:17,950 --> 02:01:20,170
Smiles have even started to appear on their faces.

1909
02:01:21,750 --> 02:01:27,890
group of black-robed people descended upon the village
within the castle and raised an ominous flag with

1910
02:01:27,890 --> 02:01:33,830
spider-like insignia upon him after preaching about
salvation and forgiveness they injected us with something

1911
02:01:33,830 --> 02:01:42,150
they claim will cure us with madness can they be trusted i
don't know if a fucking guy came from a castle and injected

1912
02:01:42,150 --> 02:01:51,870
you with something i don't know do you trust that and that
really be trusted oh that's him is that a priest Oh,

1913
02:01:52,050 --> 02:01:52,910
that's...

1914
02:01:52,910 --> 02:01:53,470
What is that?

1915
02:01:53,770 --> 02:01:57,730
Watch over the village in my stead, and my smiles always
find you in photographs.

1916
02:01:58,490 --> 02:01:59,430
That little bit.

1917
02:01:59,930 --> 02:02:00,050
Oh.

1918
02:02:01,330 --> 02:02:02,530
Yes, he shouldn't.

1919
02:02:02,610 --> 02:02:03,750
Oh, hey, there's a...

1920
02:02:05,150 --> 02:02:05,390
Oh.

1921
02:02:05,830 --> 02:02:06,290
Nice.

1922
02:02:06,810 --> 02:02:07,290
Alright.

1923
02:02:07,590 --> 02:02:08,130
Reload.

1924
02:02:10,170 --> 02:02:11,510
Okay, what's this photo?

1925
02:02:11,850 --> 02:02:12,330
Is this lore?

1926
02:02:13,690 --> 02:02:15,950
The long-awaited iron works.

1927
02:02:16,030 --> 02:02:16,810
Oh, this is lore.

1928
02:02:18,390 --> 02:02:18,990
Boop.

1929
02:02:19,750 --> 02:02:20,350
Money.

1930
02:02:22,510 --> 02:02:23,790
Did I miss anything?

1931
02:02:27,250 --> 02:02:27,930
Oh, there's more, Lord.

1932
02:02:28,670 --> 02:02:30,630
The elder entrusted the village to me today.

1933
02:02:30,990 --> 02:02:33,290
He told me I can learn my duties as I go.

1934
02:02:33,790 --> 02:02:35,690
I'll start by keeping a record of the village.

1935
02:02:36,050 --> 02:02:37,850
There's so many words I cannot write.

1936
02:02:38,510 --> 02:02:40,950
But the elder encouraged me.

1937
02:02:41,050 --> 02:02:42,110
I will do my best.

1938
02:02:42,810 --> 02:02:46,010
There is a young boy who lives in a cabin by the lake with
his grandfather.

1939
02:02:46,690 --> 02:02:49,370
It seems that his mother was called to heaven upon his
birth.

1940
02:02:49,850 --> 02:02:53,630
His grandfather doesn't talk much, The lad is very bright
and spirited.

1941
02:02:54,330 --> 02:02:57,830
He told me a story about a knight who rides a donkey again
today.

1942
02:02:58,590 --> 02:03:00,450
The boy's grandfather has fallen ill.

1943
02:03:00,870 --> 02:03:02,570
His condition worsens every day.

1944
02:03:03,090 --> 02:03:07,350
The boy worries terribly about him, and there are murmurs of
a madness among the villagers.

1945
02:03:07,990 --> 02:03:14,170
As I took my leave, the old man pulled me aside and said, If
anything happens, you know what to do.

1946
02:03:15,030 --> 02:03:17,230
I can only nod in response.

1947
02:03:18,850 --> 02:03:20,410
It was a terrible night.

1948
02:03:21,750 --> 02:03:24,590
around the cabin and watched as it burned to the ground.

1949
02:03:25,150 --> 02:03:27,450
The boy looked on without saying a word.

1950
02:03:27,850 --> 02:03:30,570
Even as dawn broke, he didn't move a muscle.

1951
02:03:30,930 --> 02:03:32,770
The next day, he was gone.

1952
02:03:33,310 --> 02:03:34,510
And then everyone clapped.

1953
02:03:37,010 --> 02:03:39,090
I missed a box over there?

1954
02:03:39,250 --> 02:03:40,750
Okay, let me check where it is.

1955
02:03:41,250 --> 02:03:42,010
Oh, there it is.

1956
02:03:45,430 --> 02:03:45,850
Nice.

1957
02:03:49,780 --> 02:03:50,820
Got an empty camera.

1958
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:52,260
What the fuck do I do with that?

1959
02:03:54,140 --> 02:03:56,880
Oh, this is the boy in his family.

1960
02:03:57,400 --> 02:03:57,940
That's him.

1961
02:03:58,560 --> 02:04:02,240
Wait, is that going to be the short guy in the later on?

1962
02:04:02,440 --> 02:04:03,380
Did he grow up to be evil?

1963
02:04:04,740 --> 02:04:07,800
Did you grow up to be evil, little boy?

1964
02:04:14,740 --> 02:04:15,160
Alright.

1965
02:04:16,740 --> 02:04:20,560
Apparently you have to be spread out right now because of
the wolf.

1966
02:04:22,320 --> 02:04:23,460
Alright, what do you got here?

1967
02:04:28,350 --> 02:04:29,610
Where's the evil wolf?

1968
02:04:30,650 --> 02:04:31,470
I'm gonna say that.

1969
02:04:31,570 --> 02:04:35,350
I know the evil wolf is gonna fucking come out and, like,
bite me or some shit.

1970
02:04:38,490 --> 02:04:38,970
Zonderman.

1971
02:04:39,410 --> 02:04:41,510
You 1% seem the type to skip the lore.

1972
02:04:41,630 --> 02:04:42,770
What the heck is happening?

1973
02:04:42,830 --> 02:04:43,430
What do you mean?

1974
02:04:43,450 --> 02:04:45,010
I always read the lore.

1975
02:04:46,450 --> 02:04:47,390
It's the lore.

1976
02:04:47,650 --> 02:04:49,430
It's the lore pause.

1977
02:04:51,770 --> 02:04:54,370
The lore always gives us the fucking pauses.

1978
02:04:56,890 --> 02:04:58,210
It's the safe space.

1979
02:05:02,870 --> 02:05:14,410
okay guys where's the evil dog we're super dog like this is
very important where the fuck is super dog the lord breaks

Super dog, are you here?

1983
02:05:46,570 --> 02:05:47,670
Super dog!

1984
02:05:51,560 --> 02:05:52,640
Super dog!

1985
02:05:53,400 --> 02:05:56,320
Oh, I hear him.

1986

I hear super dog.

He's on the other side!

1988
02:06:12,480 --> 02:06:14,140
What the fuck he's on the other side?

1989
02:06:14,920 --> 02:06:16,280
Super dog's on the other side.

1990
02:06:17,060 --> 02:06:17,900
Where did he get there?

1991
02:06:20,840 --> 02:06:22,400
I heard him, he barked.

1992
02:06:23,200 --> 02:06:24,620
Super dog barked.

1993
02:06:25,040 --> 02:06:26,620
But it wasn't like the scary bark.

1994
02:06:26,780 --> 02:06:30,240
He just went, Wait, I missed the treasure.

1995
02:06:30,480 --> 02:06:31,880
Okay, guys, where's the treasure again?

1996
02:06:32,320 --> 02:06:33,020
I already forgot.

1997
02:06:33,980 --> 02:06:34,520
I forgot.

1998
02:06:37,800 --> 02:06:40,160
Is that on the first floor or the second floor?

1999
02:06:41,540 --> 02:06:42,460
Oh, there it is.

2000
02:06:43,560 --> 02:06:44,400
Alright, I got it.

2001
02:06:44,680 --> 02:06:45,820
I know I missed something here.

Okay.

2003
02:06:49,160 --> 02:06:51,300
Super dog, where are you?

2004
02:06:51,420 --> 02:06:52,500
There you are!

2005
02:06:53,900 --> 02:06:55,400
Get over here!

2006
02:06:56,340 --> 02:06:57,520
Open the door!

2007
02:06:57,980 --> 02:06:59,240
Wait, can I just shoot you from here?

2008
02:07:00,380 --> 02:07:01,900
Super dog, come back!

2009
02:07:03,640 --> 02:07:05,400
Super dog, come back!

02:07:05,780 --> 02:07:06,460

Where did he go?

2013
02:07:14,200 --> 02:07:15,980
Where the fuck did he go?

2014
02:07:23,830 --> 02:07:25,210
Where are you?

2015
02:07:27,250 --> 02:07:27,810
Super dog?

2016
02:07:32,910 --> 02:07:33,370

2021
02:07:55,670 --> 02:07:56,030

He really was the super dog.

2028
02:08:49,110 --> 02:08:50,150
Jesus Christ.

2029
02:08:50,450 --> 02:08:51,850

There's no super dog.

02:13:19,200 --> 02:13:21,320
The stab didn't show up!

2094
02:13:24,980 --> 02:13:25,440
Okay.

2095
02:13:27,420 --> 02:13:29,340
What the fuck happened?

2096
02:13:31,320 --> 02:13:33,460
My shotgun, Emu!

2097
02:13:34,880 --> 02:13:36,700
Oh, my shotgun, Emu!

2098
02:13:37,540 --> 02:13:37,940
No!

2099
02:13:40,660 --> 02:13:41,200
No!

2100
02:13:49,630 --> 02:13:52,430
A beautiful shotgun ammo.

2101
02:13:52,630 --> 02:13:53,870
What the fuck is that?

2102
02:13:54,010 --> 02:13:54,830
Is that the cow?

2103
02:13:59,360 --> 02:14:00,560
That's the strongman!

2104
02:14:02,360 --> 02:14:04,160
This is what the rifle is for.

2105
02:14:06,180 --> 02:14:07,100
Nice, he's dead.

2106
02:14:09,100 --> 02:14:09,340
Alright.

2107
02:14:10,300 --> 02:14:10,840
There we go.

2108
02:14:11,360 --> 02:14:13,000
I mean, the cows are still alive.

2109
02:14:13,120 --> 02:14:13,780
Good for them.

2110
02:14:15,680 --> 02:14:16,720
Good for them.

2111
02:14:16,860 --> 02:14:19,210
The cows are still fucking tanking it.

2112
02:14:21,620 --> 02:14:23,360
Okay, we're gonna be living in poverty soon.

2113
02:14:23,940 --> 02:14:25,680
Remember when we had like 80 at...

2114
02:14:25,680 --> 02:14:26,160

2115
02:14:26,700 --> 02:14:27,040

2116
02:14:27,580 --> 02:14:27,880

2117
02:14:29,480 --> 02:14:32,580

2118
02:14:33,340 --> 02:14:33,460
How?

2119
02:14:34,120 --> 02:14:35,360
That was point blank.

2120
02:14:36,500 --> 02:14:38,480
Guys, remember when we had 80 bullets?

2121
02:14:39,360 --> 02:14:40,060
I remember.

2122
02:14:42,260 --> 02:14:42,920
How?

2123
02:14:43,420 --> 02:14:43,800
How?

2124
02:14:44,240 --> 02:14:45,120
There's no way.

2125
02:14:45,360 --> 02:14:46,640
There's no fucking way.

2126
02:14:47,160 --> 02:14:48,520
There's no fucking way.

2127
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:50,360
Please.

2128
02:14:51,100 --> 02:14:52,400
Please give me a chance to melee.

2129
02:14:56,260 --> 02:14:57,220
Okay, there you go.

2131
02:14:58,720 --> 02:14:59,200

Okay.

2133
02:15:01,100 --> 02:15:01,300
Thank God.

2134
02:15:01,660 --> 02:15:01,660
Okay.

2135
02:15:02,240 --> 02:15:03,440
Everything is fine.

2136
02:15:04,840 --> 02:15:06,300
Everything is fine.

2137
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:09,320

No, okay, we are so fucking poor.

2146
02:15:33,160 --> 02:15:34,300
I need to stop shooting.

2147
02:15:34,640 --> 02:15:36,800
I need to stop shooting.

2148
02:15:38,580 --> 02:15:40,120
We're so poor.

2149
02:15:40,500 --> 02:15:43,900

the president.

You want to put it on online to sell because the pawn shop
will always rip you off If I ever get a medal of honor, make

2190
02:19:34,040 --> 02:19:37,400

The fuck, holy shit.

2271
02:25:22,610 --> 02:25:25,230
Gosh, it was good timing.

2272
02:25:25,610 --> 02:25:26,330
Good timing.

2273
02:25:27,910 --> 02:25:28,810
The clutch.

2274
02:25:32,530 --> 02:25:33,450
Finally, Ashley.

2275
02:25:33,470 --> 02:25:45,990
did something useful bro where you oh because they injected
her with stuff saved by the plot the moment i saw the axe i

2276
02:25:45,990 --> 02:26:01,810
knew is caused by something called the plaga the plaga okay
you saw those people right but you have the same thing

2277
02:26:01,810 --> 02:26:05,550
inside you The same thing that made them like that.

2278
02:26:05,830 --> 02:26:07,030
Wait, we're gonna turn like them?

2279
02:26:07,090 --> 02:26:09,190
Yes, we're just experiencing these symptoms.

2280
02:26:10,550 --> 02:26:11,410
They're only the beginning.

2281
02:26:12,550 --> 02:26:13,750
I don't want to become like them.

2282
02:26:14,890 --> 02:26:16,790
You are, well, lucky.

2283
02:26:17,170 --> 02:26:17,970
Wait, how so?

2284
02:26:18,090 --> 02:26:20,550
You see, at this early stage, the parasite, the plaga.

2285
02:26:21,710 --> 02:26:25,510
It is possible to remove it with the surgical procedure.

2286
02:26:26,670 --> 02:26:27,990
And all you need is some know-how.

2287
02:26:28,670 --> 02:26:30,710
And oh, yeah, the right equipment.

2288
02:26:31,390 --> 02:26:32,670
Wait, do you know how?

2289
02:26:34,610 --> 02:26:35,490
No worries.

2290
02:26:35,970 --> 02:26:38,270
See, I have a kitchen knife.

2291
02:26:39,410 --> 02:26:40,670
But you're going to have to trust me.

2292
02:26:44,110 --> 02:26:45,270
I have a kitchen knife.

2293
02:26:45,350 --> 02:26:46,030

2294
02:26:46,970 --> 02:26:46,970

Now where's the Amber?

2311
02:27:40,230 --> 02:27:42,230
Unfortunately, it's not on me at the moment.

2312
02:27:43,490 --> 02:27:47,750
And you really should be telling me what a good job I did.

2313
02:27:48,830 --> 02:27:52,190
Busted my ass and managed to hide it right before I got
caught.

2314
02:27:54,310 --> 02:27:56,510
Which is why I'm still alive.

2315
02:27:57,730 --> 02:27:59,810
Yeah, I think she's just making him climb that.

2316
02:28:00,670 --> 02:28:02,870

2317
02:28:03,510 --> 02:28:05,890
No amber, no protection, Louise.

2318
02:28:08,390 --> 02:28:10,190
Such a stickler for details, huh, Ada?

2319

How about that?

2322
02:28:27,740 --> 02:28:30,400
And I do have something else I need to get, too.

2323
02:28:32,800 --> 02:28:33,300

2324
02:28:33,620 --> 02:28:34,540

2327
02:28:38,780 --> 02:28:40,850

2331
02:28:58,660 --> 02:29:00,140
We could take the boat.

2332
02:29:00,260 --> 02:29:00,640
Let's go.

2333
02:29:02,120 --> 02:29:03,860
We take that boat.

2334
02:29:04,560 --> 02:29:06,080

02:29:17,760 --> 02:29:21,940
He's so fucked up.

2339
02:29:23,040 --> 02:29:25,480
What's gonna happen to me?

2340
02:29:26,180 --> 02:29:26,640
Right now.

2341
02:29:26,780 --> 02:29:27,820
Gone forever.

2342
02:29:33,810 --> 02:29:35,290
Goodbye loot.

2343
02:29:36,290 --> 02:29:36,710
Goodbye.

2344
02:29:37,250 --> 02:29:37,990
Oh my god.

2345
02:29:38,850 --> 02:29:41,030
But I do have all these kitchen knives.

2346
02:29:41,670 --> 02:29:43,870
Okay, I'm gonna make, I'm gonna save this.

02:29:47,890 --> 02:29:48,410
Alright.

2350
02:29:48,630 --> 02:29:49,250

Guys.

2357
02:29:57,790 --> 02:29:58,930

02:37:35,920 --> 02:37:36,060
What?

2442
02:37:36,460 --> 02:37:40,800
You're going to be responsible if she just dies and I have
to do all of that again.

2443
02:37:40,880 --> 02:37:41,840
Oh, I forgot to repair the knife.

2444
02:37:42,040 --> 02:37:43,040
Sorry, we're going back.

2445
02:37:44,740 --> 02:37:45,240
Sorry, Ashley.

2446
02:37:45,400 --> 02:37:45,940
We're going back.

2447
02:37:47,860 --> 02:37:48,560
What if she doesn't?

2448
02:37:48,660 --> 02:37:50,680
Well, that's not the risk I'm going to take.

2449
02:37:51,060 --> 02:37:52,580
It's not even 50-50.

2450
02:37:53,240 --> 02:37:56,200
There's more of a chance that she's just going to fucking
die.

2451
02:37:57,500 --> 02:37:57,900
Okay.

2452
02:37:59,000 --> 02:37:59,800
All right.

2453
02:38:00,120 --> 02:38:00,500
Nice.

2454
02:38:02,200 --> 02:38:02,980
The weak.

2455
02:38:03,140 --> 02:38:04,540
It's the president's daughter.

2456
02:38:05,300 --> 02:38:06,800
It doesn't matter how weak she is.

2457
02:38:07,580 --> 02:38:08,940
She's the president's daughter.

2458
02:38:12,040 --> 02:38:12,580
But...

2459
02:38:12,580 --> 02:38:14,200
Okay, I cannot protect stupid.

2460
02:38:16,380 --> 02:38:17,620
I can delay it.

2461
02:38:17,800 --> 02:38:19,000
But I can't protect it.

2462
02:38:25,550 --> 02:38:26,810
What the fuck?

2463
02:38:26,890 --> 02:38:27,750
Does Ashley burn?

2464
02:38:27,950 --> 02:38:28,610
She doesn't burn.

2465
02:38:28,710 --> 02:38:29,330
Oh, thank God.

2466
02:38:29,470 --> 02:38:29,710
Okay.

2467
02:38:30,610 --> 02:38:31,650
She doesn't burn.

2468
02:38:31,830 --> 02:38:32,450
That's like...

2469
02:38:32,450 --> 02:38:33,470
That's fine.

2470
02:38:37,030 --> 02:38:37,890
Alright, nice.

2471
02:38:38,630 --> 02:38:39,550
Does she turn?

2472
02:38:39,830 --> 02:38:43,110
Well, if she turns, she can't fucking like do the thing.

2473
02:38:43,990 --> 02:38:44,830
Oh, she is turning.

2474
02:38:45,290 --> 02:38:46,330
Are you serious?

2475
02:38:48,650 --> 02:38:49,450
I did.

2476
02:38:50,570 --> 02:38:52,230
What, like, what is she gonna do?

2477
02:38:52,570 --> 02:38:53,810
Is she gonna drop down?

2478
02:38:54,830 --> 02:38:56,390
Yeah, she can't do anything.

2479
02:38:57,390 --> 02:38:59,910
Okay, but she's annoying me, so I'm just gonna kill it.

2480
02:39:00,250 --> 02:39:04,770
She is annoying, though.

2481
02:39:05,830 --> 02:39:06,310
There you go.

2482
02:39:09,710 --> 02:39:10,190
Nice.

2483
02:39:10,630 --> 02:39:11,970
God, more money that I don't need.

2484
02:39:12,650 --> 02:39:14,750
I need fucking loot, not money.

2485
02:39:16,130 --> 02:39:16,710
Thank you.

2486
02:39:17,190 --> 02:39:18,010
That's what I need.

2487
02:39:19,630 --> 02:39:23,950
Alright, I thought you guys said like, it's better if it's
like stealth.

2488
02:39:24,890 --> 02:39:27,210
That was like not even that many people.

2489
02:39:30,970 --> 02:39:33,610
I think maybe this is where I should stealth.

2490
02:39:37,100 --> 02:39:38,220
If there's people here.

2491
02:39:39,020 --> 02:39:40,620
Actually, no, I don't need to stealth this.

2492
02:39:40,840 --> 02:39:43,020
Wait, am I missing loot behind me?

2493
02:39:43,100 --> 02:39:43,700
Oh, I'm not.

2494
02:39:44,180 --> 02:39:44,920
Oh, wait, I am.

2495
02:39:47,040 --> 02:39:48,280
Wait a minute.

2496
02:39:51,940 --> 02:39:52,760
Wait a minute.

2497
02:39:54,260 --> 02:39:55,580
I am missing loot.

2498
02:39:56,280 --> 02:39:56,960
Sorry, Ashley.

2499
02:39:57,160 --> 02:39:58,040
This is important.

2500
02:39:58,700 --> 02:40:02,460
Why did

2501
02:40:06,420 --> 02:40:07,540
I come back here?

2502
02:40:07,880 --> 02:40:10,100
Why did I come back here?

2503
02:40:10,840 --> 02:40:12,880
Why the fuck did I come back?

2504
02:40:17,440 --> 02:40:18,200
Nice.

2505
02:40:18,560 --> 02:40:19,580
We needed that.

2506
02:40:19,880 --> 02:40:21,680
We needed a circular thing.

2507
02:40:23,620 --> 02:40:24,780
Up we go.

2508
02:40:26,420 --> 02:40:26,580
Boop.

2509
02:40:27,800 --> 02:40:28,020
Nice.

2510
02:40:28,460 --> 02:40:29,280
Rifle ammo.

2511
02:40:30,680 --> 02:40:31,620
I'm fucking...

2512
02:40:31,620 --> 02:40:32,340
Are you fucking?

2513
02:40:35,960 --> 02:40:36,720
Okay.

2514
02:40:39,040 --> 02:40:40,180
That's fine.

2515
02:40:40,780 --> 02:40:41,400
That's fine.

2516
02:40:42,260 --> 02:40:44,140
Where are all these bear traps coming from?

2517
02:40:44,800 --> 02:40:47,060
Where are they all coming from?

2518
02:40:47,940 --> 02:40:49,240
Okay, we're okay.

2519
02:40:49,660 --> 02:40:50,000
We're okay.

2520
02:40:50,380 --> 02:40:51,440
We're okay.

2521
02:40:52,440 --> 02:40:53,560
It just keeps happening.

2522
02:40:58,880 --> 02:40:59,360
Here we go.

2523
02:40:59,940 --> 02:41:00,400
We're fine.

2524
02:41:03,740 --> 02:41:04,600
We're fine.

2525
02:41:05,900 --> 02:41:06,800
Everything is fine.

2526
02:41:07,160 --> 02:41:09,200
Okay, there is loot here.

2527
02:41:11,580 --> 02:41:12,480
Okay, how do I get up here?

2528
02:41:12,520 --> 02:41:13,200
Oh, there it is.

2529
02:41:14,980 --> 02:41:16,420
What the fuck?

2530
02:41:18,060 --> 02:41:20,340
Bro, okay, don't announce your...

2531
02:41:21,040 --> 02:41:21,640
Oh!

2532
02:41:24,920 --> 02:41:26,120
Oh, shit!

2533
02:41:28,560 --> 02:41:29,540
There we go.

2534
02:41:30,060 --> 02:41:30,860
Alright, that's fine.

2535
02:41:32,380 --> 02:41:33,020
That is fine.

2536
02:41:33,160 --> 02:41:34,120
Do I have another egg?

2537
02:41:34,200 --> 02:41:35,700
I do not have another egg.

2538
02:41:36,060 --> 02:41:38,020
Okay, we need a yellow herb.

2539
02:41:38,360 --> 02:41:39,200
We are...

2540
02:41:39,200 --> 02:41:40,720
Okay, I can take this.

2541
02:41:41,340 --> 02:41:42,320
It'll be fine.

2542
02:41:42,660 --> 02:41:43,920
I can take this.

2543
02:41:44,100 --> 02:41:44,460
We don't...

2544
02:41:44,460 --> 02:41:45,720
We don't need a worry.

2545
02:41:46,220 --> 02:41:47,180
We'll find...

2546
02:41:47,180 --> 02:41:48,960
We'll find a yellow herb.

2547
02:41:48,980 --> 02:41:50,540
sooner or later.

2548
02:41:50,900 --> 02:41:51,840
That's the risk I'm willing.

2549
02:41:52,020 --> 02:41:53,060
Okay, maybe not.

2550
02:41:53,140 --> 02:41:56,800
The way you're looking at me, Ashley, I don't know if that
is the risk I'm willing to take.

2551
02:41:58,200 --> 02:42:00,740
I have so many sprays.

2552
02:42:02,220 --> 02:42:04,120
I have so many sprays.

2553
02:42:04,320 --> 02:42:04,780
That's fine.

2554
02:42:05,380 --> 02:42:06,480
This is fine.

2555
02:42:07,820 --> 02:42:11,200
I realize that should not be a risk I should take.

2556
02:42:12,480 --> 02:42:13,800
Like thinking about it.

2557
02:42:13,820 --> 02:42:15,200
That's not a great idea.

2558
02:42:17,100 --> 02:42:18,960
Bro, I haven't even fought like Adam.

2559
02:42:18,980 --> 02:42:20,340
Sandler yet.

2560
02:42:22,020 --> 02:42:23,060
Where'd I go?

2561
02:42:23,960 --> 02:42:24,840
Oh, it's this way.

2562
02:42:29,810 --> 02:42:34,670
Like, I haven't fought Adam Sandler, and I don't know if
I'll have the resources for this now.

2563
02:42:36,330 --> 02:42:38,010
Because I'm fighting everybody.

2564
02:42:38,650 --> 02:42:39,390
Sure is quiet.

2565
02:42:39,710 --> 02:42:40,650
Yeah, I don't like that.

2566
02:42:41,130 --> 02:42:41,850
It sure is.

2567
02:42:42,310 --> 02:42:43,810
Why did you have to say that, Leon?

2568
02:42:44,930 --> 02:42:45,450
Why?

2569
02:42:45,970 --> 02:42:47,370
Never say it's quiet.

2570
02:42:48,350 --> 02:42:49,810
It's never a good sign.

2571
02:42:55,590 --> 02:42:57,550
Okay, we gotta go this way.

2572
02:42:59,810 --> 02:43:01,070
Welcome, welcome to the tomato farm!

2573
02:43:01,410 --> 02:43:01,930
Welcome, welcome!

2574
02:43:05,790 --> 02:43:08,330
Okay, we can stealth this.

2575
02:43:09,990 --> 02:43:10,310
Right?

2576
02:43:11,310 --> 02:43:13,970
Maybe I'll like stab one correctly.

2577
02:43:14,950 --> 02:43:18,330
Does he see me?

2578
02:43:20,750 --> 02:43:22,170
Does he see me?

2579
02:43:27,890 --> 02:43:30,190
Guys, I thought he didn't see me.

2580
02:43:30,530 --> 02:43:32,210
How was I supposed to know?

2581
02:43:36,090 --> 02:43:37,130
I don't know.

2582
02:43:38,670 --> 02:43:40,070
There was a...

2583
02:43:40,070 --> 02:43:41,950
He could have not seen me.

2584
02:43:42,230 --> 02:43:43,750
There could have been a possibility.

2585
02:43:44,470 --> 02:43:46,330
Wait, wait, wait.

2586
02:43:50,430 --> 02:43:52,010
It could have been possible.

2587
02:43:52,810 --> 02:43:53,930
I just wanted to...

2588
02:43:53,930 --> 02:43:54,170
No.

2589
02:43:55,450 --> 02:43:57,090
Just wanted to test out my theory.

02:49:50,940 --> 02:49:52,800
I can't believe it.

2645
02:49:52,920 --> 02:49:55,160
There was a door here this entire time.

2646
02:49:56,120 --> 02:49:57,420
Wait, there's a first aid spray.

2647
02:49:57,540 --> 02:49:59,640

02:50:00,800 --> 02:50:02,640

02:50:03,680 --> 02:50:04,300

2655
02:50:17,400 --> 02:50:19,120
Two chainsaw women!

2656
02:50:19,680 --> 02:50:20,080
What?

2657
02:50:20,100 --> 02:50:22,220
Why did mom let you have two?

2658
02:50:23,120 --> 02:50:24,880
Sorry, I didn't realize it was yours.

2659
02:50:25,640 --> 02:50:26,440
I didn't realize it was yours.

2660
02:50:26,440 --> 02:50:27,400
I am flattered.

2661
02:50:27,980 --> 02:50:29,600
What the fuck?

2662
02:50:32,140 --> 02:50:34,260
Why did mom let you have two?

2663
02:50:35,260 --> 02:50:35,740
Oh god.

2664
02:50:36,720 --> 02:50:37,280
Oh god.

2665
02:50:39,520 --> 02:50:42,220
What the fuck?

2666
02:50:42,600 --> 02:50:43,440
Oh god.

2667
02:50:44,680 --> 02:50:44,860
Oh god.

2668
02:50:44,860 --> 02:50:45,080
Oh god.

2669
02:50:45,380 --> 02:50:46,840
Oh what the fuck I do?

2670
02:50:46,920 --> 02:50:48,840
Oh thank you for opening that door.

2671
02:50:49,240 --> 02:50:51,280
Now I know why Ashley is gone.

2672
02:50:55,880 --> 02:50:57,600
Jesus Christ, okay.

2673
02:51:02,120 --> 02:51:03,640
Wait, I hear people behind me.

2674
02:51:04,180 --> 02:51:04,840
That's not good.

2675
02:51:05,300 --> 02:51:07,900
I don't like it when I hear people behind me.

2676
02:51:09,960 --> 02:51:10,720
Oh, God.

2677
02:51:11,200 --> 02:51:12,000
Oh, God.

2678
02:51:12,440 --> 02:51:15,500
Oh, I don't like it when there's two chainsaw women!

2679
02:51:16,960 --> 02:51:18,220
It's not hot!

2680
02:51:25,330 --> 02:51:26,970
Sometimes, two is two.

2681
02:51:26,990 --> 02:51:27,530
many.

2682
02:51:28,090 --> 02:51:29,670
It's just, what do you do?

2683
02:51:34,670 --> 02:51:37,430
There's too much going on.

2684
02:51:41,610 --> 02:51:43,870
There's just too much going on.

2685
02:51:45,170 --> 02:51:46,650
It's just too overwhelming.

2686
02:51:49,070 --> 02:51:49,910
Wait, where are they?

2687
02:51:51,250 --> 02:51:53,110
Where did chainsaw women go?

2688
02:51:53,470 --> 02:51:54,770
Bro, what the fuck, Matt?

2689
02:51:55,510 --> 02:51:56,270
What the fuck?

2690
02:51:56,330 --> 02:51:57,930
I can just keep going backwards.

2691
02:52:00,150 --> 02:52:00,770
Like...

2692
02:52:02,150 --> 02:52:03,990
Alright, we're just gonna...

2693
02:52:05,010 --> 02:52:07,050
Let me feed...

2694
02:52:07,050 --> 02:52:08,590
I know my back is clear.

2695
02:52:09,170 --> 02:52:09,890
That's the answer.

2696
02:52:10,730 --> 02:52:12,290
That's what I...

2697
02:52:12,290 --> 02:52:13,670
Do I have nades?

2698
02:52:13,950 --> 02:52:14,590
Oh, I did.

2699
02:52:14,890 --> 02:52:17,150
Bro, I didn't even know I had nades!

2700
02:52:17,890 --> 02:52:18,710
Wait, what?

2701
02:52:19,010 --> 02:52:21,030
Are they... Can they just walk away?

2702
02:52:23,690 --> 02:52:24,770
Where are they?

2703
02:52:25,690 --> 02:52:26,910
They just walked away.

2704
02:52:26,990 --> 02:52:28,190
It is

2705
02:52:33,030 --> 02:52:33,430
Hello?

2706
02:52:39,280 --> 02:52:39,940
Where did they go?

2707
02:52:42,440 --> 02:52:42,840
What?

2708
02:52:43,020 --> 02:52:44,020
They gave up?

2709
02:52:44,780 --> 02:52:45,880
Oh, thank God.

2710
02:52:49,260 --> 02:52:50,420
Like, where did they go?

2711
02:52:51,160 --> 02:52:53,000
Like, they all just disappeared.

2712
02:52:58,520 --> 02:52:59,960
Alright, let's just get rid of him.

2713
02:53:00,100 --> 02:53:00,940
Do they drop anything?

2714
02:53:01,340 --> 02:53:02,860
Oh, Thank God they do.

2715
02:53:03,340 --> 02:53:04,520
Okay, it's worth killing them.

2716
02:53:06,040 --> 02:53:07,280
Okay, it's worth killing them.

2717
02:53:07,360 --> 02:53:08,900
I just need to know where chainsaw women.

2718
02:53:09,600 --> 02:53:11,040
Where the chainsaw women go.

2719
02:53:11,500 --> 02:53:12,340
Where are they?

2720
02:53:12,640 --> 02:53:12,860
Oh!

2721
02:53:13,520 --> 02:53:14,860
Knock right now!

2722
02:53:21,500 --> 02:53:22,540
Holy shit!

2723
02:53:23,760 --> 02:53:25,720
Ask and ye shall receive.

2724
02:53:28,600 --> 02:53:29,500
Alright, there we go.

2725
02:53:29,860 --> 02:53:30,460
Whoa, shit.

2726
02:53:30,680 --> 02:53:30,920
Okay.

2727
02:53:34,020 --> 02:53:35,080
Okay, nice.

2728
02:53:36,340 --> 02:53:37,080
Melee, melee, melee!

2729
02:53:39,360 --> 02:53:41,260
Oh my god, he's still alive.

2730
02:53:41,840 --> 02:53:42,400
There you go.

2731
02:53:43,520 --> 02:53:45,480
Yeah, but I got chainsaw women!

2732
02:53:48,100 --> 02:53:49,780
Do they actually keep coming?

2733
02:53:51,480 --> 02:53:53,100
Wait, do they actually?

2734
02:53:53,660 --> 02:53:54,180
Do they...

2735
02:53:54,180 --> 02:53:55,400
Is this infinite?

2736
02:53:55,700 --> 02:53:56,260
Is this infinite?

2737
02:53:56,500 --> 02:53:56,760
Is this infinite?

2738
02:53:56,760 --> 02:53:57,160
Is this infinite?

2739
02:53:59,000 --> 02:54:01,140
The most important question!

2740

That's fine.

2744
02:54:42,900 --> 02:54:43,660
Where's the gun at?

2745
02:54:43,760 --> 02:54:45,120
It's okay, there's ammo right there.

2746
02:54:46,400 --> 02:54:47,040
That's fine.

2747
02:54:48,720 --> 02:54:50,340
Thank God there's always an end.

2748
02:54:51,260 --> 02:54:52,220
Thank fucking God.

2749
02:54:54,320 --> 02:54:54,840
Ashley?

2750
02:54:56,060 --> 02:54:57,680
Who told you to get out of the locker?

2751
02:54:58,640 --> 02:54:59,700
Who told you?

2752
02:54:59,820 --> 02:55:00,980
Because it's not me.

2753
02:55:02,380 --> 02:55:03,620
I know for sure.

2754
02:55:03,680 --> 02:55:05,100
was not me.

2755
02:55:07,500 --> 02:55:09,140
Ashley, get back in that locker, Ashley.

2756
02:55:09,840 --> 02:55:10,520
Get back.

2757
02:55:13,300 --> 02:55:15,480
Go back into that locker.

2758
02:55:16,820 --> 02:55:18,840
Leon did not say get out.

2759
02:55:21,760 --> 02:55:23,020
Go back in here.

2760
02:55:23,100 --> 02:55:24,460
I know there was a locker here.

2761
02:55:24,980 --> 02:55:25,600
Ashley, get...

2762
02:55:25,600 --> 02:55:26,220
Oh my god.

2763
02:55:26,320 --> 02:55:26,700
No!

2764
02:55:26,920 --> 02:55:28,620
I can't keep you here forever?

2765
02:55:29,960 --> 02:55:30,560
No!

2766
02:55:32,840 --> 02:55:35,080
Ashley, Why do you do this?

2767
02:55:35,260 --> 02:55:36,360
Do you hate me, Ashley?

2768
02:55:39,460 --> 02:55:47,100
Ashley, I only had one simple request and it's for you to
live in that locker until I was done.

2769
02:55:48,760 --> 02:55:50,380
Do you hate me, Ashley?

2770
02:55:51,560 --> 02:55:52,980
Ashley, I'm not gaslighting you.

2771
02:55:53,200 --> 02:55:54,500
Do you just hate me?

2772
02:56:00,980 --> 02:56:02,480
Alright, here we go.

2773
02:56:04,340 --> 02:56:06,780
The locker is your home now, Ashley.

2774
02:56:07,480 --> 02:56:08,140
Never leave.

2775
02:56:11,980 --> 02:56:12,640
Bro, what?

2776
02:56:13,680 --> 02:56:15,520
Bro, Leon!

2777
02:56:16,280 --> 02:56:16,600
Bro!

2778
02:56:19,220 --> 02:56:21,440
Bro, what the fuck, Leon?

2779
02:56:22,020 --> 02:56:23,420
That is inappropriate.

2780
02:56:25,760 --> 02:56:27,380
I wonder if I can craft more rifle.

2781
02:56:27,580 --> 02:56:28,360
Okay, I need two more.

2782
02:56:28,440 --> 02:56:30,300
I feel like I definitely need more rifle.

2783
02:56:31,640 --> 02:56:33,660
Okay, let me put some of this.

2784
02:56:33,680 --> 02:56:43,420

02:57:12,650 --> 02:57:14,070
There's loot in here.

2790
02:57:14,650 --> 02:57:15,870
How do I get that loot?

2791
02:57:18,630 --> 02:57:20,450
God, I don't need more money.

2792
02:57:21,050 --> 02:57:22,330
I can't buy anything.

2793

I can't even buy anything.

2796
02:57:29,650 --> 02:57:30,550
So there's no point.

2797
02:57:33,290 --> 02:57:33,590

03:08:27,640 --> 03:08:28,100
An eye.

2976
03:08:28,680 --> 03:08:29,860
Just like Mario.

2977
03:08:31,580 --> 03:08:32,060
Mario.

2978
03:08:39,690 --> 03:08:41,590
Oh, there we go.

2979
03:08:42,330 --> 03:08:43,010
I knew it.

2980
03:08:43,210 --> 03:08:44,950
Hoarding was always the right answer.

2981
03:08:49,110 --> 03:08:49,890
All right, here we go.

2982
03:08:51,150 --> 03:08:52,290
Thank you for the eye.

2983
03:08:53,290 --> 03:08:54,910
Give my regards to your God.

2984
03:08:55,970 --> 03:08:56,770
Is there any loot?

2985
03:08:57,050 --> 03:08:58,010
Okay, nice.

2986
03:08:58,250 --> 03:08:58,830
Oh, my God.

2987
03:08:58,910 --> 03:08:59,970
There was a lot of loot.

2988
03:09:00,370 --> 03:09:01,550
Give me a sec, Ashley!

2989
03:09:01,950 --> 03:09:03,450
I need the loot!

2990
03:09:04,450 --> 03:09:08,210
Guys, I might be inhaling a lot of smoke, Ashley, but this
is important.

2991
03:09:09,350 --> 03:09:11,290
This is very important to Leon.

2992
03:09:12,250 --> 03:09:13,170
Give me a sec.

2993
03:09:13,710 --> 03:09:14,830
Okay, let's see.

2994
03:09:15,950 --> 03:09:20,450
Look, I know I'm inhaling a lot of smoke right now, Ashley,
but you don't understand.

2995
03:09:22,270 --> 03:09:23,010
All right.

2996
03:09:24,630 --> 03:09:25,810
Where there's a ladder?

2997
03:09:26,010 --> 03:09:26,870
Oh, there is.

2998
03:09:27,050 --> 03:09:27,850
Okay, here you go.

2999
03:09:28,370 --> 03:09:28,910
Don't worry.

3000
03:09:29,190 --> 03:09:31,930
This fire is really fucking hot, but don't worry.

3001
03:09:35,130 --> 03:09:47,810
it's dangerous actually you don't understand my love for
loot transcends danger she will never understand okay oh

right i'm gonna definitely upgrade reload speed i realized

3004
03:10:08,190 --> 03:10:17,770

realized that might have been a mistake did i just okay guys

3005
03:10:17,770 --> 03:10:25,190
we didn't see that wait i missed them no

3006
03:10:34,710 --> 03:10:35,950
actually no

3007
03:10:43,790 --> 03:10:44,310
No!

3008
03:10:45,990 --> 03:10:46,170
No!

3009
03:10:46,170 --> 03:10:47,470
This fire's bound to catch their attention.

3010
03:10:50,330 --> 03:10:50,850
No!

3011
03:10:50,850 --> 03:10:53,290
I'm not gonna turn into one of them, right?

3012
03:10:53,690 --> 03:10:54,210
No!

3013
03:10:55,410 --> 03:10:56,450
I don't know.

3014
03:10:57,470 --> 03:10:59,430
Maybe their god is, like, worth it.

3015
03:10:59,750 --> 03:11:01,310
Like, they get special powers.

3016
03:11:02,290 --> 03:11:03,990
I grabbed the eyeball, though.

3017
03:11:04,250 --> 03:11:05,290
I got the eyeball.

3018
03:11:05,590 --> 03:11:07,290
At least I have the cool eye.

3019
03:11:08,410 --> 03:11:10,410
I can't believe it.

3020
03:11:10,950 --> 03:11:12,610
I can't believe it.

3021
03:11:12,650 --> 03:11:13,150
That loot.

3022
03:11:13,510 --> 03:11:14,770
What do you mean always see that map?

3023
03:11:14,930 --> 03:11:16,130
There's literally nothing!

3024
03:11:21,210 --> 03:11:22,930
Oh, that loot.

3025
03:11:24,210 --> 03:11:25,910
It wasn't treasure, right?

3026
03:11:28,390 --> 03:11:33,190
If Ashley turns into a monster and Leon kills her, does she
drop loot?

3027
03:11:33,430 --> 03:11:34,550
Very good question.

3028
03:11:36,590 --> 03:11:37,870
Very good question.

3029
03:11:41,330 --> 03:11:48,410
okay there we are all right let's see wait there's a
treasure behind me actually there's a treasure behind us

3030
03:11:48,410 --> 03:12:03,290
where is it moors looking up there it is thank god i didn't
see i saw that thank god this time i looked at the map do

3031
03:12:03,290 --> 03:12:10,810
you think leon used conditioner or just champ dude look at
him yeah unless he's a fucking greasy ass dude i'm pretty

3032
03:12:10,810 --> 03:12:20,010
sure he uses no there's no way leon definitely is not like
he's not a neat so like i'm pretty sure he uses conditioner

3033
03:12:20,010 --> 03:12:22,830
he wants to continue the bloodline

3034
03:12:26,270 --> 03:12:37,320
well at least you don't have to worry about being followed
come on yeah his hair is way too shiny for no conditioner i

3035
03:12:37,320 --> 03:12:44,980
actually I don't use conditioner because like, um, I used to
swim a lot, uh, as a, as a kid.

3036
03:12:45,320 --> 03:12:47,440
And because of that, I fucked up my hair.

3037
03:12:47,640 --> 03:12:52,760
Uh, because I, like, as Asian parents do, they, they make
your kid do lots of swimming lessons.

3038
03:12:53,240 --> 03:12:55,160
They make your kid do a lot of different lessons.

3039
03:12:55,260 --> 03:12:58,620
So then I like did a lot of like swimming lessons and stuff.

3040
03:12:59,000 --> 03:13:04,300
Um, I never got past a single level because I couldn't do
the butterfly stroke or like the, the frog.

3041
03:13:04,460 --> 03:13:06,260
I call it the frog because they called it a frog.

3042
03:13:06,600 --> 03:13:07,700
And I like failed three classes.

3043
03:13:07,720 --> 03:13:18,140
um i failed the class three fucking times because i could
never do the frog i retook the class three fucking times and

3044
03:13:18,140 --> 03:13:25,080
it's not like the every time you take the class you do the
frog you have to learn all the things in that class the same

3045
03:13:25,080 --> 03:13:32,500
time like all we have to like always learn that same thing
over like all the other steps not just the froggy thing um

3046
03:13:32,500 --> 03:13:38,500
So, like, you know, I had to keep retaking it three fucking
times, and I could never get the frog right.

3047
03:13:38,720 --> 03:13:40,760
So I failed three fucking times.

3048
03:13:41,100 --> 03:13:48,500
And every time I had to learn the basics, front stroke,
backstroke, all that over and over again.

3049
03:13:48,760 --> 03:13:50,220
But it's always the frog.

3050
03:13:50,400 --> 03:13:51,980
I could never do the frog.

3051
03:13:52,480 --> 03:13:59,600
Anyway, the moral of that story, I don't use conditioner
because, like, my hair, like, gets, like, natural, like,

3052
03:13:59,600 --> 03:14:08,000
it's, like, gets, like, greasy, really really quick so like
i always have to take like uh because of like the swimming

3053
03:14:08,000 --> 03:14:15,080
ruined my hair so like i couldn't do conditioner anymore
because like my scalp is like super fucked up because

3054
03:14:22,620 --> 03:14:31,320
so so like i used to use conditioner but like i had to stop
because like my hair got super fucked up that I could never,

3055
03:14:31,460 --> 03:14:33,220
I can't use conditioner anymore.

3056
03:14:39,880 --> 03:14:40,800
Let's see.

3057
03:14:43,160 --> 03:14:45,540
That's the moral of the story.

3058
03:14:48,480 --> 03:14:48,820
Alright.

3059
03:14:50,700 --> 03:14:51,120

3060
03:14:55,020 --> 03:14:55,680

03:15:12,320 --> 03:15:12,720
Where do we go?

3067
03:15:13,640 --> 03:15:14,080

3068
03:15:15,200 --> 03:15:16,780
Come to the courtyard inside of the castle.

3069
03:15:17,560 --> 03:15:18,440

The dragon, thank you, thank you, thank you.

3157

Singering is for DPS, which is which one you like more is I
like power.

This is bullshit.

3203
03:25:04,790 --> 03:25:06,610
The way they're hiding, I hate that.

Woo!

3209
03:25:47,330 --> 03:25:48,870
Okay, that's not cool.

3211
03:25:52,790 --> 03:25:54,490
That is not cool.

3212
03:25:54,770 --> 03:25:55,750

3215
03:26:04,690 --> 03:26:06,610

03:26:50,770 --> 03:26:52,710
Where the fuck is the other catapult?

3221
03:26:55,390 --> 03:26:57,290

There's the next catapult.

3233
03:27:23,330 --> 03:27:26,430
I don't know where the next catapult is, and that's the
scary part.

3234
03:27:29,410 --> 03:27:30,470

03:27:41,330 --> 03:27:42,610
There's no barrel!

3239
03:27:45,860 --> 03:27:48,400
How am I supposed to get it when there's no barrel?

3240
03:27:50,220 --> 03:27:50,940
Oh, God.

3241
03:27:51,700 --> 03:27:52,380

There's no barrel.

3245
03:27:57,300 --> 03:27:59,260

3246
03:28:00,820 --> 03:28:01,420

03:28:07,160 --> 03:28:08,260
You can one shot apparently.

3252
03:28:12,460 --> 03:28:14,960
Okay, I'm going to see if I can see the barrel from here.

03:28:56,960 --> 03:28:58,320
Okay, I don't know where to go.

3260
03:28:58,500 --> 03:28:59,580
I'm just going to stay back here.

3261
03:28:59,880 --> 03:29:00,680
This is the beginning.

3262
03:29:01,260 --> 03:29:01,960
This is the...

3263
03:29:03,880 --> 03:29:05,580
I went the wrong way, Ashley.

3264
03:29:06,020 --> 03:29:06,440
We got...

3265
03:29:06,440 --> 03:29:07,640
I went the wrong way.

3266
03:29:07,880 --> 03:29:09,080
I went backwards.

3267
03:29:09,600 --> 03:29:11,220
Ashley, I'm sorry.

3268
03:29:11,420 --> 03:29:12,100
I went backwards.

3269
03:29:12,360 --> 03:29:13,200
I'm so lost.

3270
03:29:13,840 --> 03:29:16,000
Ashley, I don't know where his left and right.

3271
03:29:16,480 --> 03:29:16,820
Ashley.

3272
03:29:17,620 --> 03:29:18,860
Wait, I could craft, though.

3273
03:29:19,260 --> 03:29:20,520
What do I need, though?

3274
03:29:20,720 --> 03:29:21,360
Do I need a rifle?

3275
03:29:22,200 --> 03:29:23,160
Actually, give me a sec.

3276
03:29:23,520 --> 03:29:26,020
Uncle Leon is trying to figure out ammo management.

3277
03:29:30,340 --> 03:29:33,880
Uncle Leon needs to work on his ammo situation.

3278
03:29:34,700 --> 03:29:35,380
Is it here?

3279
03:29:37,020 --> 03:29:37,540
No!

3280
03:29:38,560 --> 03:29:39,240
It's locked!

3281
03:29:39,240 --> 03:29:39,440
It's locked!

3282
03:29:39,460 --> 03:29:39,800
It's locked!

3283
03:29:39,900 --> 03:29:40,520
To get creative.

3284
03:29:42,960 --> 03:29:43,900
Oh my god, actually.

3285
03:29:44,760 --> 03:29:46,020
There's a barrel without loot!

3286
03:29:47,600 --> 03:29:48,080
Nice.

3287
03:29:48,760 --> 03:29:48,940

Okay.

3290

3291
03:29:54,620 --> 03:29:54,620
Okay.

3292
03:29:54,880 --> 03:29:56,500
Uncle Leon doesn't know what to do.

3293
03:29:56,840 --> 03:29:58,960
Uncle Leon is so fucked up right now.

3294
03:30:02,900 --> 03:30:02,940
Oh.

3295
03:30:03,160 --> 03:30:04,000

We gotta do the side quest.

3331
03:33:31,950 --> 03:33:34,590
This side quest is more important.

3332
03:33:37,770 --> 03:33:39,130

03:34:14,810 --> 03:34:16,590

There we go.

3377
03:36:45,620 --> 03:36:48,260

03:37:35,100 --> 03:37:35,620
No, I don't.

3400
03:37:35,720 --> 03:37:37,920

3406
03:37:55,160 --> 03:37:55,580

3412
03:38:08,900 --> 03:38:09,940
Mr. Kennedy.

03:42:56,160 --> 03:42:57,320
Something I can sell.

3489
03:42:59,220 --> 03:42:59,500
Okay.

3490
03:43:01,240 --> 03:43:02,180
Let's see.

3491
03:43:03,740 --> 03:43:05,720
That is the door where I can't open.

3492
03:43:05,900 --> 03:43:06,380
Knock, knock.

3493
03:43:07,660 --> 03:43:08,180
Knock, knock.

3494
03:43:08,360 --> 03:43:08,940
I'm alive.

3495
03:43:10,480 --> 03:43:10,920
Okay.

3496
03:43:11,220 --> 03:43:17,780
We're going to save again because, um, because, like, you
know, every time you make a little bit of progress you gotta

3497
03:43:17,780 --> 03:43:24,740
save so you don't want it this is efficiency because what
happens if i fucking just die because i don't want to do

3498
03:43:24,740 --> 03:43:35,700
this again every time you make a little bit of progress you
have to save so you don't have to that's why i have 51 saves

3499
03:43:40,200 --> 03:43:59,460
this is exactly why we have 51 saves guys it's just see
because what if i just die spread out with me with me okay i

3500
03:44:01,210 --> 03:44:11,510
just okay nice okay it's made of wood so i can i like how

3502
03:44:26,620 --> 03:44:27,820
I knew I heard something.

3503
03:44:31,400 --> 03:44:32,640
Uh, wait, what's that treasure?

3504
03:44:32,780 --> 03:44:33,320
Is it not?

3505
03:44:33,520 --> 03:44:34,380
It must be above.

3506
03:44:35,140 --> 03:44:36,700
Must be above, because I can't get it.

3507
03:44:36,700 --> 03:44:38,020
Looks like we can continue on this way.

3508
03:44:38,500 --> 03:44:39,380
Oh my god.

3509
03:44:40,580 --> 03:44:42,060
God damn it, it's dark.

3510
03:44:43,100 --> 03:44:43,840
I hate it.

3511
03:44:43,980 --> 03:44:44,600
I hate it.

3512
03:44:45,140 --> 03:44:46,200
I hate this.

3513
03:44:46,900 --> 03:44:48,160
I fucking hate this.

3514
03:44:48,860 --> 03:44:50,060
Okay, he's definitely dead.

3515
03:44:51,240 --> 03:44:53,200
Oh no, this is a torture room.

3516
03:44:53,800 --> 03:44:55,100
Is there any yet?

3517
03:44:55,220 --> 03:44:56,280
Oh my gosh, no.

3518
03:44:56,960 --> 03:44:58,440
I hate this.

3519
03:44:58,880 --> 03:45:00,520
I hate this so much.

3520
03:45:01,200 --> 03:45:01,920
I hate this.

3521
03:45:02,260 --> 03:45:03,040
I hate this.

3522
03:45:04,380 --> 03:45:05,220
Can you move?

3523
03:45:05,580 --> 03:45:06,380
Poor bastard.

3524
03:45:07,180 --> 03:45:07,920
That's no way to go.

3525
03:45:08,000 --> 03:45:10,780
Can I not just like untie him and like fucking move?

3526
03:45:11,800 --> 03:45:15,400
I was awoken in the middle of the night once again.

3527
03:45:16,500 --> 03:45:19,940
It's those awful noises coming from the basement.

3528
03:45:20,660 --> 03:45:23,520
The sounds of nails clawing at the stone walls.

3529
03:45:23,800 --> 03:45:33,680
and the writhing moan of curses that man harbors enough hate
to ruin this world he once served the lord of the castle as

3530
03:45:33,680 --> 03:45:42,680
the torturer like his father and grandfather before him it's
one of the most unsightly legacies left by the salazar

3531
03:45:42,680 --> 03:45:52,100
family even among his family he was special he enjoyed his
work wholeheartedly and had a talent for it he was gifted at

3532
03:45:52,100 --> 03:45:59,940
tormenting others His ability soon attracted the master's
interest, and when he took him to the dungeon, No, I can't

3533
03:45:59,940 --> 03:46:00,680
write anymore.

3534
03:46:01,420 --> 03:46:02,060
I won't.

3535
03:46:03,440 --> 03:46:06,320
I don't want to recall what happened down there.

3536
03:46:08,140 --> 03:46:09,660
My mind can't take it.

3537
03:46:10,040 --> 03:46:11,220
It will break me.

3538
03:46:11,780 --> 03:46:18,680
I was ordered to attend him, to feed him, dispose of the
fifth, all while listening to that wretched voice every

3539
03:46:18,680 --> 03:46:19,060
night.

3540
03:46:19,780 --> 03:46:21,240
I can't take it anymore.

3541
03:46:21,480 --> 03:46:22,640
I've had enough.

3542
03:46:23,320 --> 03:46:25,820
not tolerate one more night in this castle.

3543
03:46:26,360 --> 03:46:27,640
I shall leave tomorrow.

3544
03:46:28,220 --> 03:46:32,180
Go far away where that voice cannot reach my ears.

3545
03:46:32,740 --> 03:46:32,740
Damn.

3546
03:46:33,580 --> 03:46:35,880
Bro, your voice was shit.

3547
03:46:37,460 --> 03:46:39,300
Definitely won't be doing any ASMR.

3548
03:46:40,400 --> 03:46:41,680
None shall escape.

3549
03:46:43,460 --> 03:46:47,940
Okay, Salazar, like that little guy, I assume the little guy
is Salazar.

3550
03:46:48,860 --> 03:46:52,920
And like his voice reminds me of an actor.

3551
03:46:53,320 --> 03:46:58,200
Like, I swear, like, it looks just like him, too.

3552
03:46:58,440 --> 03:47:01,860
Like, the act, like, some old-timey actor from a long time
ago.

3553
03:47:01,920 --> 03:47:02,860
Oh, hey, the Iron Maiden.

3554
03:47:04,340 --> 03:47:06,040
I'm trying to, like, remember who.

3555
03:47:06,380 --> 03:47:08,380
Like, his, his, the whole voice, too.

3556
03:47:08,960 --> 03:47:10,100
What was that?

3557
03:47:10,340 --> 03:47:11,860
I was having a Zatudan.

3558
03:47:16,280 --> 03:47:20,160
Like, there was an actor, like, that sounds and looks just
like him.

3559
03:47:20,920 --> 03:47:22,260
I can't remember who.

3560
03:47:27,180 --> 03:47:27,660
Oh.

3561
03:47:27,880 --> 03:47:28,880
Don't worry, I have my shotgun.

3562
03:47:30,220 --> 03:47:31,600
Don't worry, don't worry, Ashley.

3563
03:47:33,500 --> 03:47:34,900
I have my shotgun, Ashley.

3564
03:47:36,260 --> 03:47:36,880
Don't worry.

3565
03:47:37,740 --> 03:47:39,380
Something's gonna come in here.

3566
03:47:41,520 --> 03:47:42,240
Don't worry.

3567
03:47:44,020 --> 03:47:45,680
Something's gonna come in here.

3568
03:47:49,480 --> 03:47:51,980
The time, the light is lost.

3569
03:47:53,640 --> 03:47:54,660
I fucking knew it!

3570
03:47:54,700 --> 03:47:55,580
I fucking knew it!

3571
03:47:59,100 --> 03:48:00,640
It's okay, I have the shotgun!

3572
03:48:06,070 --> 03:48:08,570
Oh, where would the shotgun go?

3573
03:48:10,470 --> 03:48:12,550
Which pattern is meta?

3574
03:48:16,110 --> 03:48:17,570
Can I just kill him?

3575
03:48:21,590 --> 03:48:23,390
Okay, guys, can I just kill him?

3576
03:48:29,350 --> 03:48:29,910
Okay.

3577
03:48:31,890 --> 03:48:33,310
Is this...

3578
03:48:33,310 --> 03:48:33,710
Yeah?

3579
03:48:37,760 --> 03:48:38,340
Try!

3580
03:48:39,420 --> 03:48:40,140
Why?

3581
03:48:41,160 --> 03:48:41,520
Oh!

3582
03:48:51,000 --> 03:48:52,620
Tell me to shoot him!

3583
03:48:53,340 --> 03:48:53,740
Oh!

3584
03:49:01,810 --> 03:49:04,390
Why didn't you tell me to shoot him?

3585
03:49:07,940 --> 03:49:08,660
Okay.

3586
03:49:08,980 --> 03:49:09,920
Okay, I have a grenade.

3587
03:49:14,100 --> 03:49:14,480
Boom!

3588
03:49:15,100 --> 03:49:15,320
Boom!

3589
03:49:18,130 --> 03:49:19,010
Oh, God.

3590
03:49:19,210 --> 03:49:20,650
I'm right out of ammo.

3591
03:49:20,730 --> 03:49:23,010
Oh, why

3592
03:49:30,900 --> 03:49:32,880

3593
03:49:39,260 --> 03:49:39,920
Oh, God.

3594
03:49:41,600 --> 03:49:43,520

03:49:44,820 --> 03:49:46,020
Oh, fuck.

03:49:46,420 --> 03:49:46,580
Invade.

3598
03:49:53,720 --> 03:49:55,300
I forgot he's blind.

3599
03:49:55,600 --> 03:49:56,200
He's blind.

3600
03:49:56,440 --> 03:49:57,780
Don't walk into anything.

3601
03:50:01,040 --> 03:50:01,220
No.

3602
03:50:01,460 --> 03:50:02,080

03:50:07,110 --> 03:50:08,690
Oh, my God.

3605
03:50:09,410 --> 03:50:10,530
He's blind.

3606
03:50:14,600 --> 03:50:15,760
Okay.

3607
03:50:17,080 --> 03:50:17,820
Okay.

3608
03:50:20,360 --> 03:50:21,980
That's okay, we did it.

3609
03:50:24,540 --> 03:50:26,820
There goes my healing items.

3610
03:50:30,920 --> 03:50:33,380
There it goes.

3611
03:50:34,660 --> 03:50:37,380
I don't need a heal item.

3612
03:50:38,500 --> 03:50:41,240
There goes all my heals.

3613
03:50:42,900 --> 03:50:43,960

And then I kept running into the spikes.

03:51:24,310 --> 03:51:25,370
Because I got scared.

3620
03:51:26,090 --> 03:51:27,590

Okay, did I get everything?

3664
03:54:37,530 --> 03:54:38,150
The treasury.

3665
03:54:38,370 --> 03:54:39,030
Oh, no.

3666
03:54:40,130 --> 03:54:41,290
I'm having some fucking...

3667
03:54:41,290 --> 03:54:43,230
Fucking PTSD right now.

3668
03:54:43,270 --> 03:54:44,230
He's seeing the treasury.

3669
03:54:48,900 --> 03:54:49,540
Oh, no.

3670
03:54:49,880 --> 03:54:50,260
Wow.

3671
03:54:50,760 --> 03:54:51,560
I'm confused.

3672
03:54:55,120 --> 03:54:56,040
Oh, no.

3673
03:54:56,220 --> 03:54:59,080
I see this and I'm confused now.

3674
03:55:04,740 --> 03:55:05,960
Okay, there is lore.

3675
03:55:06,220 --> 03:55:07,520
Okay, the iron sword.

3676
03:55:07,680 --> 03:55:08,640
We got the sword.

3677
03:55:10,000 --> 03:55:10,520
What if I...

3678
03:55:10,520 --> 03:55:11,820
We got the gold sword.

3679
03:55:12,060 --> 03:55:12,280
Okay.

3680
03:55:12,600 --> 03:55:14,300
And then we got the rusted sword.

3681
03:55:15,160 --> 03:55:15,460
Oh!

3682
03:55:15,820 --> 03:55:16,620
It's a puzzle!

3683
03:55:18,900 --> 03:55:20,400
Can we not open this?

3684
03:55:20,760 --> 03:55:21,400
What do we do?

3685
03:55:25,300 --> 03:55:26,260
What does this do?

3686
03:55:29,980 --> 03:55:30,540
Okay.

3687
03:55:30,960 --> 03:55:31,120
Alright.

3688
03:55:31,380 --> 03:55:40,240
So obviously, this one would be the rusted sword because
he's killing people?

3689
03:55:41,260 --> 03:55:41,540
No.

3690
03:55:41,740 --> 03:55:42,360
No, no, no.

3691
03:55:42,500 --> 03:55:43,740
Wait, wait, wait.

3692
03:55:43,780 --> 03:55:44,060
Wait.

3693
03:55:45,360 --> 03:55:45,920
Okay.

3694
03:55:46,220 --> 03:55:46,760
Let's see.

3695
03:55:47,100 --> 03:55:49,480
This one will obviously be the gold sword.

3696
03:55:52,280 --> 03:55:53,400
Because he's gone.

3697
03:55:54,660 --> 03:55:56,260
And then... Oh no, I'm right!

3698
03:55:57,040 --> 03:55:59,800
Wait, I can ring those gongs.

3699
03:56:00,680 --> 03:56:01,120
What?

3700
03:56:02,300 --> 03:56:03,640
But, like, what about this room?

3701
03:56:03,740 --> 03:56:05,820
This one has to be the iron sword.

3702
03:56:08,140 --> 03:56:09,020
And then...

3703
03:56:09,800 --> 03:56:11,660
Why is there one sword empty?

3704
03:56:13,300 --> 03:56:15,180
Why is this sword empty, though?

3705
03:56:20,460 --> 03:56:21,780
I don't have all the swords.

3706
03:56:21,880 --> 03:56:24,040
Oh, I don't have all the swords!

3707
03:56:26,520 --> 03:56:29,600
Oh, I was gonna say, like, where the fuck are the other
swords?

3708
03:56:30,160 --> 03:56:32,500
Like, where are the other swords?

3709
03:56:35,380 --> 03:56:36,160
yeah

3710
03:56:44,020 --> 03:56:45,190

3711
03:56:48,610 --> 03:56:53,190

03:57:22,750 --> 03:57:23,870

Oh.

3719
03:57:27,770 --> 03:57:28,430
Wait, what?

3720
03:57:31,130 --> 03:57:33,070
Well, clearly it was not timed.

3721
03:57:37,830 --> 03:57:38,410
Okay.

3722
03:57:39,530 --> 03:57:40,010
Oh, no.

Of course I'm right.

3736
03:58:29,800 --> 03:58:31,960
Ashley, I didn't need your help.

3737
03:58:32,920 --> 03:58:34,120
That's what chat is for.

3738
03:58:34,540 --> 03:58:35,340
Ashley, are you chat?

3739
03:58:35,560 --> 03:58:35,800
No.

3740
03:58:36,340 --> 03:58:38,080
You didn't join my membership.

3741
03:58:40,820 --> 03:58:41,660
You're not subscribed.

3742
03:58:42,280 --> 03:58:45,500
When you subscribe to me, Ashley, then you can backseat me.

3743
03:58:45,660 --> 03:58:46,900
There's a fucking snake!

3744
03:58:47,720 --> 03:58:48,460
Where did he go?

3745
03:58:48,700 --> 03:58:49,260
Oh, there he is.

3746
03:58:49,320 --> 03:58:50,640
Why can't I just step on it?

3747
03:58:52,380 --> 03:58:53,080
That snake.

3748
03:58:54,180 --> 03:58:54,460
Okay.

03:58:55,720 --> 03:58:57,940

way is items this way is loot

3884
04:05:45,810 --> 04:05:56,440
typewriter typewriter nice there are some parasites that
have the ability to control their host this is basic

3885
04:05:56,440 --> 04:06:05,900
knowledge among most biologists but not much is known as to
how the bear it the following is a list of several such

3886
04:06:05,900 --> 04:06:15,140
parasites the dichro once the larvae of the parasite
migrates to the ant they altered oh this is the last of us

3887
04:06:15,140 --> 04:06:23,180
that's the the mushrooms the larva this parasite makes their
home inside the brain of a fish such as the yellow tail and

3888
04:06:23,180 --> 04:06:30,340
uh parrot bass once infected the fish makes its way up to
the water surface where it will swim until eaten by seabirds

3889
04:06:30,340 --> 04:06:39,120
oh yeah so the reason why is that the birds when they eat it
the parasite like um the parasite can only like reproduce in

3890
04:06:39,120 --> 04:06:46,980
their shit so like the fish you know the way it spreads is
by bird poop i know this i don't know i don't remember when

3891
04:06:46,980 --> 04:06:54,420
i learned it but i know it this parasites develop in the
snail's eye stalks oh i've seen these they're they make it

3892
04:06:54,420 --> 04:07:01,180
look like they're at a rave those parasites make the snails
look like they're at a rave um this is also a lot of them

3893
04:07:01,180 --> 04:07:09,260
are like a lot of them spread by bird poop uh they alter the
snail's behavior and force it to move to the top of the

3894
04:07:09,260 --> 04:07:15,880
plant to make it more visible to birds once eaten by the
bird the parasite will complete its metamorphosis into an

3895
04:07:15,880 --> 04:07:29,130
adult the rainbow snails yeah they're in fucking pain and
they are dying but it looks cool okay no okay this is the

3896
04:07:29,130 --> 04:07:35,370
objective so i'm gonna go this way Alright, yes, we don't go

04:14:47,600 --> 04:14:49,340
My pistol can kill him.

4029
04:14:50,580 --> 04:14:52,020
It's a fucking waste.

4030
04:14:52,960 --> 04:14:55,140
It's a waste of a good flashbang.

4031
04:14:59,680 --> 04:15:02,040
Jesus, he's so tanky.

4032
04:15:03,140 --> 04:15:04,300

Why were you yelling me?

4047
04:16:31,160 --> 04:16:33,240
We don't even have one.

4048
04:16:43,260 --> 04:16:46,720
I can't believe you guys yelled at me about the flash
grenades.

4049
04:16:46,900 --> 04:16:48,800
And we never even had one

4050
04:16:52,250 --> 04:16:58,230
I can't believe it There see I told you eventually we will
kill these guys

4051
04:17:01,450 --> 04:17:03,310
We had enough bullets.

Oh my god, I could have shot this

4053
04:17:09,160 --> 04:17:11,260

Oh, okay.

04:18:12,910 --> 04:18:13,950
I couldn't tell.

4067
04:18:14,570 --> 04:18:17,030
It's so hard to see if he has a mouth.

4068
04:18:17,770 --> 04:18:18,930
Like, where's your head?

4069
04:18:19,350 --> 04:18:21,430
I couldn't tell where the head was.

4070
04:18:22,370 --> 04:18:23,550
It's too confusing.

4071
04:18:25,670 --> 04:18:27,430
Like, he was just all mouth.

4072
04:18:27,550 --> 04:18:28,050

04:20:19,880 --> 04:20:20,720
Ashley, Ashley, Ashley!

4099
04:20:21,800 --> 04:20:23,800
We gotta lead him to an explosive!

4100
04:20:23,800 --> 04:20:25,500
I said this is our only hope now!

4101
04:20:26,800 --> 04:20:29,060
I don't have a lot of ammo anymore!

4102
04:20:29,520 --> 04:20:30,820
I'm fucked up!

4103
04:20:37,640 --> 04:20:38,580
Please tell me he's dead.

4104
04:20:38,840 --> 04:20:40,040
He's not dead!

4105
04:20:42,540 --> 04:20:43,660
Ashley, Ashley, Ashley!

4106
04:20:48,540 --> 04:20:50,100
Okay, here we go.

4107
04:20:50,660 --> 04:20:51,660
We're fine, we're fine.

4108
04:20:52,000 --> 04:20:52,720
Everything's fine.

4109
04:20:53,080 --> 04:20:54,760
We're really poor right now.

4110
04:20:55,160 --> 04:20:55,600
But we're fine.

4111
04:20:57,280 --> 04:20:58,400
Please live.

4112
04:21:00,260 --> 04:21:02,600
Oh my god, we're okay.

4113
04:21:03,360 --> 04:21:05,140
We're very poor right now.

4114
04:21:05,300 --> 04:21:06,920
Our economy is in shambles.

4115
04:21:07,660 --> 04:21:08,740
But we are okay.

4116
04:21:08,840 --> 04:21:13,060
I'm not even gonna bother using my fucking sniper.

4117
04:21:15,720 --> 04:21:17,220
Oh my god.

4118
04:21:17,400 --> 04:21:18,200
Bro, really?

4119
04:21:18,540 --> 04:21:20,520
Bro, I'm just...

4120
04:21:20,520 --> 04:21:25,260
Bro, I do not need, like, sniper ammo to kill you.

4121
04:21:26,520 --> 04:21:27,880
I can see your head.

4122
04:21:28,480 --> 04:21:29,500
Oh my god!

4123
04:21:31,600 --> 04:21:37,640
Bro, he- Actually, please.

4124
04:21:38,260 --> 04:21:38,460
Please.

4125
04:21:38,820 --> 04:21:39,120
Please!

4126
04:21:40,320 --> 04:21:40,680
Catch it!

4127
04:21:46,920 --> 04:21:47,780
Oh, God.

4128
04:21:49,640 --> 04:21:50,360
Holy shit.

4129
04:21:50,800 --> 04:21:50,980
Okay.

4130
04:21:53,220 --> 04:21:53,700
We're fine.

4131
04:21:54,720 --> 04:21:55,380
It's fine.

4132
04:21:55,480 --> 04:21:56,360
We'll use the pistol.

4133
04:21:57,140 --> 04:22:00,020
We literally do not need rifles for this.

4134
04:22:01,400 --> 04:22:02,980
Like, our aim is good enough.

4135
04:22:03,960 --> 04:22:04,360
You okay?

4136
04:22:04,940 --> 04:22:05,240
Yeah.

4137
04:22:06,060 --> 04:22:07,400
Oh, my God.

4138
04:22:07,520 --> 04:22:08,000
Please.

4139
04:22:08,080 --> 04:22:09,700
tell me I have enough to craft.

4140
04:22:09,820 --> 04:22:11,460
Okay, we need shotgun ammo.

4141
04:22:11,860 --> 04:22:12,660
We're so poor.

4142
04:22:13,080 --> 04:22:14,460
We're so poor.

4143
04:22:15,980 --> 04:22:17,800
I need yellow herbs.

4144
04:22:19,860 --> 04:22:21,760
Oh my god, okay, we're fine.

4145
04:22:26,640 --> 04:22:27,300
I think we're good.

4146
04:22:28,000 --> 04:22:29,160
I think we're good now.

4147
04:22:29,480 --> 04:22:31,340
I think I think we're okay.

4148
04:22:32,460 --> 04:22:34,200
Alright, time to use the wheel.

4149
04:22:34,460 --> 04:22:36,420
Time to use the wheel.

4150
04:22:40,060 --> 04:22:43,580
Oh my god, we have nothing left.

4151
04:22:45,200 --> 04:22:47,380
Yes, Ashley, so awesome.

4152
04:22:48,960 --> 04:22:49,880
So awesome.

4153
04:22:50,780 --> 04:22:52,700
Guys, remember when I had 70 bullets?

4154
04:22:53,040 --> 04:22:54,000
I remember.

4155
04:22:58,360 --> 04:22:59,900
Okay, here we go.

4156
04:23:01,800 --> 04:23:03,520
Oh my god, don't tell me there's more.

4157
04:23:03,700 --> 04:23:05,200
Don't tell me there is more.

4158
04:23:05,860 --> 04:23:08,820
Don't tell me there's more.

4159
04:23:09,740 --> 04:23:10,220
Bro!

4160
04:23:16,470 --> 04:23:18,860
The economy hit hard.

4161
04:23:23,800 --> 04:23:24,980
This part fucking sucks.

4162
04:23:25,140 --> 04:23:25,880
I miss sniping.

4163
04:23:28,460 --> 04:23:29,300
We go back.

4164
04:23:31,040 --> 04:23:31,920
We go back.

4165
04:23:32,380 --> 04:23:34,420
If we trigger somebody we go back.

4166
04:23:39,920 --> 04:23:41,540
Oh, no.

4167
04:23:45,680 --> 04:23:46,240
Bro.

4168
04:23:50,900 --> 04:23:53,080
God, there's only resources.

4169
04:23:53,660 --> 04:23:56,060
What about these sniper ammo?

4170
04:24:00,080 --> 04:24:01,600
All right.

4171
04:24:06,150 --> 04:24:07,430
All right, here you go.

4172
04:24:12,240 --> 04:24:13,940
Little over the top, don't you think?

4173
04:24:15,260 --> 04:24:15,820
like Mario.

4174
04:24:17,100 --> 04:24:18,140
It's just like Mario.

4175
04:24:19,240 --> 04:24:21,020
It's just like Mario.

4176
04:24:22,140 --> 04:24:24,160
Oh my god, I don't have enough ammo.

4177
04:24:27,020 --> 04:24:27,300
Please.

4178
04:24:28,500 --> 04:24:31,480
I don't know if I can protect you.

4179
04:24:32,240 --> 04:24:33,940
No, this is it.

4180
04:24:34,020 --> 04:24:36,380
This is the sniper area.

4181
04:24:37,960 --> 04:24:39,540
Okay, Ashley, here we go.

4182
04:24:45,200 --> 04:24:46,160
You're gonna be okay?

4183
04:24:47,780 --> 04:24:50,160
This is it.

4184
04:25:01,010 --> 04:25:01,710
Okay.

4185
04:25:03,090 --> 04:25:04,410
Don't have a lot.

4186
04:25:05,790 --> 04:25:06,630
But okay.

4187
04:25:09,910 --> 04:25:11,690
Oh shit, okay.

4188
04:25:20,070 --> 04:25:20,370
Alright.

4189
04:25:27,810 --> 04:25:29,810
Oh my god, please Leon.

4190
04:25:29,950 --> 04:25:32,150
You're not supposed to be missing right now.

4191
04:25:32,930 --> 04:25:33,870
Oh my god.

4192
04:25:34,150 --> 04:25:35,950
What do you want?

4193
04:25:38,070 --> 04:25:40,590
What do you mean?

4194
04:25:44,770 --> 04:25:45,570
Guys!

4195
04:25:46,570 --> 04:25:46,870
Chill!

4196
04:25:47,450 --> 04:25:48,510
Actually, chill!

4197
04:25:54,310 --> 04:25:56,070
Oh, thank you.

4198
04:26:01,060 --> 04:26:02,500
Oh my god, please.

4199
04:26:03,280 --> 04:26:03,820
Please.

4200
04:26:04,700 --> 04:26:05,760
I have to...

4201
04:26:05,760 --> 04:26:06,200
Please!

4202
04:26:06,780 --> 04:26:07,280
Let me alone!

4203
04:26:18,670 --> 04:26:20,010
Oh my god!

4204
04:26:20,210 --> 04:26:20,490
Get down!

4205
04:26:20,750 --> 04:26:21,170
Get down!

4206
04:26:21,410 --> 04:26:22,310
Get down, Ashley!

4207
04:26:25,570 --> 04:26:27,890
Okay, I'm fucking...

4208
04:26:27,890 --> 04:26:30,310
Jesus Chris, I'm gonna knife now.

4209
04:26:32,310 --> 04:26:33,550
Thank god.

4210
04:26:35,850 --> 04:26:37,610
I just had enough ammo.

4211
04:26:38,090 --> 04:26:41,110
I actually just got enough ammo.

4212
04:26:41,870 --> 04:26:43,450
Thank fucking god.

4213
04:26:43,890 --> 04:26:45,650
Like, give me, I'm so fucking full.

4214
04:26:45,670 --> 04:26:46,490
now.

4215
04:26:49,790 --> 04:26:51,470
Got a drop down.

4216
04:26:52,210 --> 04:26:56,370
Oh my God.

4217
04:26:56,970 --> 04:26:59,390
Okay, craft rifle ammo.

4218
04:27:00,170 --> 04:27:02,690
Because by God, we need this shit.

4219
04:27:03,410 --> 04:27:03,630
Okay.

4220
04:27:06,050 --> 04:27:07,870
Don't say that.

4221
04:27:07,990 --> 04:27:09,910
Don't fucking say that.

4222
04:27:10,410 --> 04:27:12,990
I'm back in the lower tax bracket.

4223
04:27:14,670 --> 04:27:15,650
Okay.

4224
04:27:15,670 --> 04:27:16,870
What am I going to do?

4225
04:27:17,290 --> 04:27:18,730
$95,000!

4226
04:27:22,670 --> 04:27:24,090
Alright, here we go.

4227
04:27:25,950 --> 04:27:26,570
There we go.

4228
04:27:26,950 --> 04:27:26,950
Nice.

4229
04:27:28,090 --> 04:27:29,050
We made it.

4230
04:27:29,290 --> 04:27:30,450
Right, thank you for the super chat.

4231
04:27:30,590 --> 04:27:30,790
Thank you.

4232
04:27:30,830 --> 04:27:31,470
Thank you.

4233
04:27:32,210 --> 04:27:32,790
Okay, Ashley.

4234
04:27:33,890 --> 04:27:34,390
Get close.

4235
04:27:35,550 --> 04:27:36,070
Alright.

4236
04:27:40,340 --> 04:27:41,100
Thank you.

4237
04:27:41,960 --> 04:27:43,640
Oh, thank God there's boxes.

4238
04:27:45,300 --> 04:27:47,720
Your guns demand funds.

4239
04:27:48,000 --> 04:27:50,120
Why can't I just buy ammo?

4240
04:27:51,720 --> 04:27:55,200
This is exactly why we're not doing the harder difficulty.

4241
04:27:55,880 --> 04:27:57,480
I would have been soft locked.

4242
04:27:59,120 --> 04:27:59,720
100%.

4243
04:27:59,720 --> 04:28:02,100
I would have been fucking soft locked.

4244
04:28:04,500 --> 04:28:05,880
Okay, let's see.

4245
04:28:13,350 --> 04:28:13,930
Wait, what?

4246
04:28:14,790 --> 04:28:15,630
Open up.

4247
04:28:16,410 --> 04:28:16,950
Wait, what?

4248
04:28:17,750 --> 04:28:18,310
What do you mean?

4249
04:28:20,530 --> 04:28:21,470
What the fuck do you mean?

4250
04:28:22,210 --> 04:28:23,470
There's a gap in the wall.

4251
04:28:23,490 --> 04:28:40,390

Ashley, look, I'm not coughing, Ashley.

4255
04:29:05,880 --> 04:29:06,340
Come on.

4256
04:29:06,600 --> 04:29:07,520
Looks like the right place.

4257
04:29:09,980 --> 04:29:10,740
What's going on?

4258
04:29:11,560 --> 04:29:12,560
Are you feeling the scene?

4259
04:29:14,200 --> 04:29:16,060
What's the inner scene kid saying?

4260
04:29:17,780 --> 04:29:21,260
Instead of worrying about her, worry about your own skin.

4261
04:29:22,620 --> 04:29:23,700
Bullish little lamb.

4262
04:29:24,100 --> 04:29:24,600
What?

4263
04:29:24,980 --> 04:29:26,880
Oh, they're controlling me.

4264
04:29:27,280 --> 04:29:28,720
Or he's controlling her.

4265
04:29:28,820 --> 04:29:40,710

4267
04:29:59,820 --> 04:30:03,920
Ashley please she's got Eva No!

4268
04:30:04,240 --> 04:30:06,000
You're supposed to be seen!

4269
04:30:06,460 --> 04:30:07,660
Not emo!

4270
04:30:09,880 --> 04:30:12,060
It's not just a face.

4271
04:30:14,760 --> 04:30:16,000
Wait, where are we at?

4272
04:30:16,060 --> 04:30:17,760
Okay, we're starting chapter 8 now.

4273
04:30:20,420 --> 04:30:23,140
Oh, and we never seen our, like, chapter results.

4274
04:30:23,500 --> 04:30:23,780
Not!

4275
04:30:23,860 --> 04:30:24,560
Look at that!

4276
04:30:24,620 --> 04:30:26,560
That's almost 90%.

4277
04:30:26,560 --> 04:30:29,300
That's almost 90%.

4278
04:30:32,380 --> 04:30:33,440
Ruse, come in.

4279
04:30:33,820 --> 04:30:34,740
Things went to shit.

4280
04:30:35,240 --> 04:30:36,840
We took refuge inside a castle.

4281
04:30:36,980 --> 04:30:38,620
These wounds, they will not hear.

4282
04:30:41,680 --> 04:30:42,080
Roost.

4283
04:30:45,220 --> 04:30:45,420
Hello.

4284
04:30:46,300 --> 04:30:46,520
Roost.

4285
04:30:48,300 --> 04:30:50,100
I lost her, and she lost my knife.

4286
04:30:51,300 --> 04:30:52,060
Damn it.

4287
04:30:52,280 --> 04:30:53,520
So much for that.

4288
04:30:56,670 --> 04:30:57,470
My knife.

4289
04:30:57,910 --> 04:30:58,690
Wait, this is...

4290
04:30:58,690 --> 04:30:59,670
Oh, I got my knife back.

4291
04:30:59,730 --> 04:31:00,350
Okay, that's good.

4292
04:31:00,430 --> 04:31:00,830
That's alright.

4293
04:31:01,030 --> 04:31:01,830
I don't give a fuck.

4294
04:31:02,350 --> 04:31:03,110
I got my knife.

4295
04:31:04,010 --> 04:31:04,950
It's alright, guys.

4296
04:31:05,030 --> 04:31:06,230
My knife is still with me.

4297
04:31:07,250 --> 04:31:10,210
It took me so long to find her.

4298
04:31:11,170 --> 04:31:13,450
And now I have to try and find her again.

4299
04:31:16,370 --> 04:31:17,490
Wait, what's over here?

4300
04:31:19,970 --> 04:31:20,310
Huh?

4301
04:31:20,750 --> 04:31:22,070
I feel like there would be something here.

4302
04:31:22,250 --> 04:31:24,030
Because there's a fountain in the courtyard.

4303
04:31:24,910 --> 04:31:25,810
The fish!

4304
04:31:27,550 --> 04:31:29,370
I'm gonna eat the fish.

4305
04:31:30,590 --> 04:31:31,250
Eat the rich.

4306
04:31:34,850 --> 04:31:36,470
That's why there's a fountain.

4307
04:31:36,890 --> 04:31:37,490
I knew it.

4308
04:31:37,910 --> 04:31:40,090
I knew there's a fountain here for a reason.

4309
04:31:40,810 --> 04:31:42,370
I knew it.

4310
04:31:43,110 --> 04:31:43,410
Nice.

4311
04:31:43,510 --> 04:31:44,270
Now I have food.

4312
04:31:44,850 --> 04:31:46,090
Okay, now I have fish.

4313
04:31:47,210 --> 04:31:48,130
Okay, this is a mess.

4314
04:31:48,270 --> 04:31:48,830
Give me a second.

4315
04:31:49,250 --> 04:31:50,530
This is a mess.

4316
04:31:51,750 --> 04:31:52,030
Okay.

4317
04:31:52,470 --> 04:31:56,110
Let us sort this out real fast.

4318
04:31:56,210 --> 04:31:57,410
No, all my kitchen knives.

4319
04:31:57,530 --> 04:31:58,230
They're gone.

4320
04:31:59,450 --> 04:32:02,650
God, I have so many resources, but no fucking gunpowder.

4321
04:32:03,510 --> 04:32:04,370
This is sad.

4322
04:32:06,110 --> 04:32:06,790
Okay, nice.

4323
04:32:06,890 --> 04:32:07,190
All right.

4324
04:32:08,410 --> 04:32:09,970
A little snack for me.

4325
04:32:11,030 --> 04:32:13,650
I really need it because I wasted so much money.

4326
04:32:14,430 --> 04:32:15,730
I wasted all my heels.

4327
04:32:17,650 --> 04:32:18,890
Oh yeah, super rough, man.

4328
04:32:19,730 --> 04:32:20,790
Do you have anything new?

4329
04:32:24,870 --> 04:32:25,430
Matilda.

4330
04:32:26,530 --> 04:32:26,970
Scope.

4331
04:32:27,170 --> 04:32:30,550
None of these are good.

4332
04:32:32,710 --> 04:32:34,570
Wait, is there the box upgrade?

4333
04:32:35,110 --> 04:32:36,090
Body armor!

4334
04:32:37,050 --> 04:32:39,370
Oh, my wares are in tiptoe.

4335
04:32:39,430 --> 04:32:41,110
Oh, this is good!

4336
04:32:41,730 --> 04:32:42,150
Nice.

4337
04:32:42,670 --> 04:32:44,250
Okay, we needed that, actually.

4338
04:32:45,510 --> 04:32:45,870
Let's see.

4339
04:32:46,170 --> 04:32:46,630
Stingray.

4340
04:32:47,050 --> 04:32:48,910
Okay, we don't need any of this.

4341
04:32:49,470 --> 04:32:50,770
All right, we have...

4342
04:32:50,770 --> 04:32:52,670
Oh, yeah, we should get the yellow herb.

4343
04:32:52,810 --> 04:32:53,450
We might as well.

4344
04:32:54,250 --> 04:32:55,070
I feel like we should.

4345
04:32:56,390 --> 04:32:57,470
Okay, let's see.

4346
04:32:57,570 --> 04:32:58,930
Do I have enough gems?

4347
04:32:59,330 --> 04:32:59,670
No.

4348
04:33:00,790 --> 04:33:01,710
I don't...

4349
04:33:01,710 --> 04:33:03,110
Okay, I can sell this.

4350
04:33:03,250 --> 04:33:05,090
I still don't have a submachine gun.

4351
04:33:05,090 --> 04:33:06,970
so I can sell that.

4352
04:33:07,750 --> 04:33:08,770
And then...

4353
04:33:08,770 --> 04:33:09,530
Anything else?

4354
04:33:09,670 --> 04:33:10,310
It should be good.

4355
04:33:11,610 --> 04:33:11,910
Oh!

4356
04:33:12,650 --> 04:33:14,730
We're inflation's hitting hard, man.

4357
04:33:17,730 --> 04:33:18,970
Alright, we're good.

4358
04:33:19,690 --> 04:33:20,630
We're good to go.

4359
04:33:21,570 --> 04:33:23,870
Wait, can I upgrade my body armor?

4360
04:33:26,090 --> 04:33:26,810
Can I?

4361
04:33:26,990 --> 04:33:28,190
No, I can repair it.

4362
04:33:28,690 --> 04:33:29,810
Alright, let's see.

4363
04:33:31,390 --> 04:33:32,170
Reload speed.

4364
04:33:33,130 --> 04:33:34,190
Rate of fire.

4365
04:33:36,090 --> 04:33:53,570
uh ammo capacity i feel like all those weapons to finish
that's all we need apply ammo capacity for my pistol i might

4366
04:33:53,570 --> 04:33:54,170
as well

4367
04:33:57,270 --> 04:34:05,550
we don't need the rifle fire ray we're so healthy Hit my
shots!

4368
04:34:11,170 --> 04:34:12,450
We're so...

4369
04:34:12,450 --> 04:34:13,210
We're okay.

4370
04:34:14,210 --> 04:34:15,630
We'll be fine.

4371
04:34:16,170 --> 04:34:17,070
Okay, fine, fine.

4372
04:34:17,530 --> 04:34:18,950
I'll do a reload speed.

4373
04:34:20,250 --> 04:34:22,230
We're a bug on the back wall?

4374
04:34:22,730 --> 04:34:23,050
What?

4375
04:34:24,970 --> 04:34:26,070
What about the bug?

4376
04:34:30,100 --> 04:34:32,680
What about the bug on the back wall?

4377
04:34:33,580 --> 04:34:34,480
What about it?

4378
04:34:35,260 --> 04:34:35,860
What?

4379
04:34:36,900 --> 04:34:37,640
What do you mean?

4380
04:34:37,940 --> 04:34:38,940
There's nothing here.

4381

04:45:47,480 --> 04:45:48,340
It's like here.

4560
04:45:48,660 --> 04:45:49,920
This is the Doki Run.

4561
04:45:50,080 --> 04:45:50,620
Exactly.

4562
04:45:51,320 --> 04:45:52,820
Doki Run is all murder.

4563
04:45:54,920 --> 04:45:56,460
Oh, I just missed money here.

4564
04:45:57,360 --> 04:45:59,420
The Doki Run is just purely murder.

4565
04:45:59,440 --> 04:45:59,880
murder.

4566
04:46:04,120 --> 04:46:07,200
The Doki run is also trying to fucking figure out where to
go.

4567
04:46:09,020 --> 04:46:10,740
Oh, it's like where I killed that guy.

4568
04:46:10,900 --> 04:46:11,520
It's right here.

4569
04:46:14,020 --> 04:46:14,760
Right here.

4570
04:46:17,340 --> 04:46:17,920
Wait, no.

4571
04:46:18,120 --> 04:46:19,080
It's not right here.

4572
04:46:20,100 --> 04:46:20,880
What the fuck?

4573
04:46:26,090 --> 04:46:28,790
Oh, where do I go?

4574
04:46:29,230 --> 04:46:29,430
Oh!

4575
04:46:33,650 --> 04:46:34,850
Where am I?

4576
04:46:35,390 --> 04:46:36,630
How do I get out of here?

4577
04:46:41,770 --> 04:46:43,230
Okay, I'm not trying to find Ludo.

4578
04:46:43,310 --> 04:46:45,030
I'm actually trying to figure out how to leave.

4579
04:46:47,270 --> 04:46:48,850
Oh, hey, on the statue?

4580
04:46:49,990 --> 04:46:51,050
Wait, there's a statue?

4581
04:46:54,370 --> 04:46:55,170
Behind me!

4582
04:47:02,060 --> 04:47:03,360
It was like...

4583
04:47:04,220 --> 04:47:05,900
Back in the OG room.

4584
04:47:09,960 --> 04:47:10,340
Right?

4585
04:47:11,500 --> 04:47:11,900
Guys.

4586
04:47:12,200 --> 04:47:13,320
Doki map.

4587
04:47:13,940 --> 04:47:14,700
There it is.

4588
04:47:14,800 --> 04:47:15,580
There it is.

4589
04:47:16,520 --> 04:47:17,120
Nice.

4590
04:47:24,620 --> 04:47:25,060
Alright.

4591
04:47:25,380 --> 04:47:26,380
We made it.

4592
04:47:27,160 --> 04:47:28,640
We made it, guys.

4593
04:47:28,920 --> 04:47:30,780
Okay, cannot craft shotgun ammo.

4594
04:47:31,000 --> 04:47:31,900
Oh, thank god I have zero.

4595
04:47:33,420 --> 04:47:36,560
Oh, it's always poverty hours here.

4596
04:47:39,800 --> 04:47:42,900
It's just always poverty hours.

4597
04:47:43,100 --> 04:47:44,040
How do I get here?

4598
04:47:45,120 --> 04:47:46,320
Oh, I need Ashley.

4599
04:47:50,360 --> 04:47:52,660
Oh, this was like...

4600
04:47:52,660 --> 04:47:53,980
That's so funny.

4601
04:47:54,300 --> 04:47:56,700
I accidentally scammed all of you.

4602
04:48:07,420 --> 04:48:10,740
I thought you could use this door.

4603
04:48:15,130 --> 04:48:15,990
The shortcut.

4604
04:48:17,050 --> 04:48:19,470
There was only one way in.

4605
04:48:23,880 --> 04:48:25,220
All right, here we go.

4606
04:48:26,560 --> 04:48:27,720
Is that what I supposed to know?

4607
04:48:27,860 --> 04:48:28,540
There was one way.

4608
04:48:28,600 --> 04:48:30,520
I haven't played the remake.

4609
04:48:31,340 --> 04:48:34,220
The remake is so different from the OG.

4610
04:48:37,880 --> 04:48:40,960
Bro, it's been like almost three years.

4611
04:48:41,060 --> 04:48:43,280
How the fuck was I supposed to remember?

4612
04:48:53,000 --> 04:48:55,380
You can stop right there.

4613
04:48:56,360 --> 04:48:56,960
Ada!

4614
04:48:58,820 --> 04:49:01,280
Bacon, murder, looting, and extortion.

4615
04:49:01,460 --> 04:49:02,540
The classic Doki run.

4616
04:49:02,700 --> 04:49:03,500
Thank you for the super chat.

4617
04:49:03,680 --> 04:49:03,820
Thank you.

4618
04:49:04,080 --> 04:49:04,460
Thank you.

4619
04:49:05,240 --> 04:49:08,280
Well, after six years, that is one hell of a greeting.

4620
04:49:08,280 --> 04:49:08,840
Six years?

4621
04:49:09,500 --> 04:49:09,720
Ada.

4622
04:49:11,120 --> 04:49:12,320
You don't seem surprised.

4623
04:49:13,440 --> 04:49:15,420
Has it really been six years, man?

4624
04:49:16,080 --> 04:49:16,640
Whoa.

4625
04:49:21,860 --> 04:49:23,560
Try using knives next time.

4626
04:49:24,500 --> 04:49:25,440
Better for close encounters.

4627
04:49:27,200 --> 04:49:29,040
My knife is $100,000.

4628
04:49:29,660 --> 04:49:30,120
$100,000.

4629
04:49:31,060 --> 04:49:31,840
More than Ashley.

4630
04:49:31,860 --> 04:49:33,760
What are you working for this time?

4631
04:49:33,920 --> 04:49:34,820
Oh, Leon.

4632
04:49:44,930 --> 04:49:45,570
Leave the girl.

4633
04:49:46,790 --> 04:49:48,090
She's lost no matter what.

4634
04:49:49,450 --> 04:49:50,290
You know that.

4635
04:49:50,350 --> 04:49:51,810
It's just a phase, Ada.

4636
04:49:53,530 --> 04:49:55,190
Maybe you'll live to meet me again.

4637
04:49:56,130 --> 04:49:57,290
And then I might get you that greeting.

4638
04:49:57,570 --> 04:50:04,430
Hey, last time I super chatted, I was asking you to throw
the boxes out in the super frantic and you threw one box,

4639
04:50:04,910 --> 04:50:07,150
fooling me twice to shame on me.

4640
04:50:08,670 --> 04:50:09,610
How about we continue?

4641
04:50:09,630 --> 04:50:13,350
Oh my

4642
04:50:18,850 --> 04:50:19,710
gosh, she disappeared.

4643
04:50:20,430 --> 04:50:21,190
She's so fast.

4644
04:50:22,670 --> 04:50:24,770
With magic.

4645
04:50:27,150 --> 04:50:28,090
She got that bug.

4646
04:50:31,930 --> 04:50:32,830
Grandma.

4647
04:50:34,090 --> 04:50:36,630
Did she just jump out the window?

4648
04:50:38,690 --> 04:50:40,150
She's bad, man.

4649
04:50:42,490 --> 04:50:44,290
Do you have fun?

4650
04:50:45,130 --> 04:50:46,150
Okay, there's no up.

4651
04:50:48,070 --> 04:50:50,290
Where the fuck is the jewelry?

4652
04:50:51,330 --> 04:50:52,610
Okay, we have no key.

4653
04:50:54,090 --> 04:50:57,210
Is there any bells to...

4654
04:50:57,210 --> 04:50:58,750
Oh, there's a chest right here.

4655
04:50:59,490 --> 04:50:59,750
Okay.

4656
04:51:00,310 --> 04:51:00,730
Nice.

Got the clock.

4658
04:51:03,950 --> 04:51:04,330
Nice.

4659
04:51:04,610 --> 04:51:07,210
Alright, we don't have the key for this yet.

4660
04:51:07,730 --> 04:51:09,850
So, we gotta go forward.

4661

04:56:00,470 --> 04:56:03,030
Guys, what chapter is Ashley missions?

What will you guys do?

4979
05:13:00,790 --> 05:13:03,890
I feel like you guys cannot live.

4980
05:13:08,060 --> 05:13:12,800
You guys won't be able to function without this genius
brain!

4981
05:13:14,560 --> 05:13:16,900
Okay, we're gonna make sure we kill this guy, though.

4982
05:13:22,840 --> 05:13:25,240
Like, you cannot comprehend my logic.

4983
05:13:27,900 --> 05:13:30,220
That's how fucking ingenious I am.

4984
05:13:30,820 --> 05:13:32,340
Okay, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick.

4985
05:13:32,340 --> 05:13:32,520
Yes!

4986
05:13:32,940 --> 05:13:33,720
Got it in time.

4987
05:13:34,060 --> 05:13:35,280
And then- Oh, he's dead.

4988
05:13:35,360 --> 05:13:36,920
Okay, I thought I had to shank him.

4989
05:13:37,900 --> 05:13:38,680
Alright, nice.

4990
05:13:40,480 --> 05:13:43,600
I feel like this stage is taking much longer than it should.

4991
05:13:45,840 --> 05:13:50,040
Dude, how ingenious I am.

4992
05:13:50,620 --> 05:13:52,620
Wait, where does this close and open, though?

4993
05:13:53,380 --> 05:13:54,440
It's sun time.

4994
05:13:56,060 --> 05:13:56,520
Nothing?

4995
05:13:57,080 --> 05:13:57,580
Oh, okay.

4996
05:13:58,300 --> 05:13:59,520
It's morning now.

5001
05:14:06,480 --> 05:14:07,440

5002
05:14:09,040 --> 05:14:10,560

I'm gonna wait for him to throw one more time.

5027
05:17:42,300 --> 05:17:43,680
There's treasure in that room!

5028
05:17:44,280 --> 05:17:46,000

Alright, guys, I'm panicking.

05:17:53,400 --> 05:17:54,900
I am panicking so fucking hard.

5034
05:17:55,420 --> 05:17:56,800
Brain no work when I panic.

5035
05:17:56,820 --> 05:17:58,420
Wait, the music stopped.

5036
05:17:58,560 --> 05:17:59,640
Is he like tired?

5037
05:18:00,300 --> 05:18:01,220
He's not tired.

5038
05:18:02,180 --> 05:18:03,580
He was not tired.

5039
05:18:05,260 --> 05:18:07,440
He was not tired, chat.

5040
05:18:08,040 --> 05:18:10,660
He was absolutely not tired, but it's okay!

5041
05:18:10,760 --> 05:18:11,560
I keep going!

5042
05:18:12,140 --> 05:18:13,080
Just keep running!

5043
05:18:15,620 --> 05:18:17,260
Just keep running.

5044
05:18:17,500 --> 05:18:18,480
Just keep running.

5045
05:18:20,420 --> 05:18:21,480
Just keep running.

5046
05:18:22,220 --> 05:18:23,800
You'll get there eventually.

5047
05:18:23,920 --> 05:18:26,340
I could have just knifed that, but I don't want panicking.

5048
05:18:26,820 --> 05:18:31,160
I could have literally just knifed it and not worried about
anything.

5049
05:18:31,940 --> 05:18:32,860
Oh my god, bro.

5050
05:18:33,040 --> 05:18:33,840
What the fuck?

5051
05:18:34,440 --> 05:18:35,620
What are you doing here?

5052
05:18:36,900 --> 05:18:38,140
I'm gonna shank you.

5053
05:18:38,840 --> 05:18:39,820
Bro, I'm gonna...

5054
05:18:47,920 --> 05:18:50,540
Bro, you guys don't deserve bullets.

5055
05:18:53,360 --> 05:18:54,140
We're good.

5056
05:18:54,260 --> 05:18:54,700
We're okay.

5057
05:18:55,300 --> 05:18:58,460
The best part about the archers is that they don't deserve
bullets.

5058
05:18:58,480 --> 05:19:08,360
the bullet like I can just shake them and they'll be fine
that's the best part I don't have to worry about I don't

5059
05:19:08,360 --> 05:19:21,440
have to worry about wasting my ammo but I knew how to do
combat I've always known what do you mean I just I just

5060
05:19:21,440 --> 05:19:23,240
don't want to They get close to me.

5061
05:19:25,640 --> 05:19:26,580
That's different.

5062
05:19:29,640 --> 05:19:30,940
I'm looking at this, bro.

5063
05:19:32,860 --> 05:19:33,440
Get ready.

5064
05:19:34,480 --> 05:19:35,680
Where is he?

5065
05:19:36,980 --> 05:19:37,760
Oh, God.

5066
05:19:37,860 --> 05:19:38,200
Thank God.

5067
05:19:39,420 --> 05:19:40,020
Holy shit.

5068
05:19:40,320 --> 05:19:41,300
That, like, was so long.

5069
05:19:41,380 --> 05:19:42,960
It took so long to move the cannon.

5070
05:19:43,400 --> 05:19:45,680
Who would have thought cannons are super fucking heavy?

5071
05:19:46,340 --> 05:19:47,320
Who would have fucking thought?

5072
05:19:50,680 --> 05:19:51,900
Oh, my God.

5073
05:19:52,260 --> 05:19:53,100
Cannons are heavy.

5074
05:19:55,500 --> 05:20:07,560
it took so fucking long to move that okay here you go down
i'll go i need to shoot the door oh but then i can shoot

5075
05:20:07,560 --> 05:20:24,020

5076
05:20:24,020 --> 05:20:24,280

5077
05:20:24,400 --> 05:20:25,860
Where did these guys come from?

5078
05:20:31,580 --> 05:20:33,500
Oh, it's nice that they're turning their backs for me.

5079
05:20:37,940 --> 05:20:37,960
Hello.

5080
05:20:39,200 --> 05:20:39,680
Hello.

5081
05:20:40,780 --> 05:20:41,220
Goodbye.

5082
05:20:43,340 --> 05:20:46,160
Okay, maybe they turn around when they hit this area.

5083
05:20:46,800 --> 05:20:47,780
Do they actually turn around?

5084
05:20:48,760 --> 05:20:50,400
What if I shoot you in the legs?

5085
05:20:50,980 --> 05:20:51,460
Oh, Joe!

5086
05:20:51,600 --> 05:20:52,220
It doesn't work!

5087
05:20:52,280 --> 05:20:53,020
Nick doesn't work!

5088
05:20:54,800 --> 05:20:56,380
But do you turn around after?

5089
05:20:56,580 --> 05:20:56,900
Ha!

5090
05:20:56,980 --> 05:20:57,960
You do!

5091
05:20:58,680 --> 05:20:59,880
That's great.

5092
05:21:00,760 --> 05:21:02,360
But you actually do turn around.

5093
05:21:04,820 --> 05:21:05,480
There we go.

5094
05:21:05,980 --> 05:21:06,380
Nice.

5095
05:21:09,800 --> 05:21:10,140
Alright.

5096
05:21:11,260 --> 05:21:13,740
We go back to the cannon, apparently.

5097
05:21:15,920 --> 05:21:17,000
Where did the cannon go?

5098
05:21:18,020 --> 05:21:18,520
Alright.

5099
05:21:18,640 --> 05:21:20,700
I keep forgetting about the door.

5100
05:21:22,480 --> 05:21:25,520
Guys, it's so heavy to move the fucking cannon.

5101
05:21:30,180 --> 05:21:31,040
Oh my god.

5102
05:21:31,060 --> 05:21:33,280
I could have shot the cannon at them like last time.

5103
05:21:33,520 --> 05:21:33,960
You're right.

5104
05:21:35,360 --> 05:21:36,380
Could have just done that.

5105
05:21:36,940 --> 05:21:38,260
That would have made it so much easier.

5106
05:21:39,200 --> 05:21:40,720
I always make things harder for myself.

5107
05:21:41,840 --> 05:21:42,680
Why do I keep doing that?

5108
05:21:42,720 --> 05:21:45,140
Wait, there's loot here that I'm missing.

5109
05:21:47,520 --> 05:21:48,520
Where is that?

5110
05:21:49,500 --> 05:21:49,900
Here?

5111
05:21:53,620 --> 05:21:55,460
There's somewhere here that has loot.

5112
05:21:55,740 --> 05:21:56,400
Oh, here it is.

5113
05:21:56,500 --> 05:21:57,160
I don't have a key.

5114
05:21:57,460 --> 05:21:57,900
God damn it.

5115
05:21:57,920 --> 05:21:58,880
I never have the key.

5116
05:22:02,620 --> 05:22:04,680
Okay, I'm just gonna reload everything.

5117
05:22:05,200 --> 05:22:07,200
I never have the key for stuff.

5118
05:22:08,100 --> 05:22:08,940
Okay, shotgun.

5119
05:22:09,220 --> 05:22:10,200
Wait, shotgun.

5120
05:22:11,820 --> 05:22:12,100
Okay.

5121
05:22:17,400 --> 05:22:19,460
Throw the cannon at the chest.

5122
05:22:22,260 --> 05:22:23,180
Doki, just shoot.

5123
05:22:23,300 --> 05:22:23,840
Oh!

5124
05:22:24,120 --> 05:22:24,760
Fuck!

5125
05:22:28,840 --> 05:22:30,080
Oh my god.

5126
05:22:30,560 --> 05:22:33,000
Oh no, please don't tell me it's Crash Bandicoot.

5127
05:22:33,920 --> 05:22:34,340
No.

5128
05:22:35,520 --> 05:22:36,000
Oh, he's dead.

5129
05:22:36,000 --> 05:22:37,160
Okay, I just can't go back.

5130
05:22:39,720 --> 05:22:40,360
Oh my god.

5131
05:22:40,640 --> 05:22:41,740
I've had my filly, you guys.

5132
05:22:43,320 --> 05:22:43,720
Oh.

5133
05:22:44,260 --> 05:22:47,160
I thought I had to do a crash bandicoot or some shit.

5134
05:22:47,380 --> 05:22:47,800
Thank god.

5135
05:22:50,280 --> 05:22:51,360
Thank god I live.

5136
05:22:53,580 --> 05:22:54,280
I lived.

5137
05:22:57,060 --> 05:22:57,360
Alright.

5138
05:22:57,560 --> 05:22:58,220
Anything in here?

5139
05:22:58,400 --> 05:22:58,700
No.

5140
05:23:00,340 --> 05:23:00,740
Alright.

5141
05:23:01,300 --> 05:23:02,340
Oh my gosh, is this the garden?

5142
05:23:02,440 --> 05:23:03,020
Is this a maze?

5143
05:23:03,300 --> 05:23:04,520
God fucking damn it.

5144
05:23:04,580 --> 05:23:05,500
It's a fucking...

5145

5148
05:23:43,180 --> 05:23:45,280
Ashley, I know it was just a phase, Ashley.

5149
05:23:46,480 --> 05:23:47,460
I know you didn't mean it.

5150
05:23:47,580 --> 05:23:49,860
I know you didn't mean it when you took my $100,000 knife.

5151
05:23:54,390 --> 05:23:55,830
Bro, you're a little girl.

5152
05:23:56,010 --> 05:23:58,170
You're gonna hurt yourself before you hurt me.

5153
05:24:02,340 --> 05:24:04,340
I wasn't myself anymore.

5154
05:24:05,580 --> 05:24:06,840
I was something else.

5155
05:24:07,240 --> 05:24:08,580
Ashley must have been terrifying now.

5156
05:24:08,700 --> 05:24:09,000
I know.

5157
05:24:12,160 --> 05:24:30,060

5160
05:24:47,650 --> 05:24:48,210
Just like me.

5161
05:24:53,430 --> 05:24:55,470
Just be like a Pokemon.

5162
05:24:58,910 --> 05:24:59,510
Ooh, nice.

5163
05:25:01,230 --> 05:25:02,430

5164
05:25:02,990 --> 05:25:03,810
Look at that.

5165
05:25:04,470 --> 05:25:05,690
Look at that.

5166
05:25:05,950 --> 05:25:07,490
Bro, I'm fucking gaming, man.

5167
05:25:08,090 --> 05:25:09,270

Yes, I can.

5172
05:25:44,930 --> 05:25:46,170
I absolutely can.

5173
05:25:46,670 --> 05:25:47,690
Actually, you don't understand.

5174
05:25:48,850 --> 05:25:51,130
I will run away the moment there's trouble.

5175
05:25:54,270 --> 05:25:56,970
There is 100% chance I can leave.

5176
05:25:59,770 --> 05:26:01,010
Okay, it's all right.

5177
05:26:01,150 --> 05:26:01,690
No, it's not.

5178
05:26:01,850 --> 05:26:02,350
Get closer.

5179
05:26:04,810 --> 05:26:05,490
Can we get to...

5180
05:26:05,490 --> 05:26:08,230
I'm pretty sure I'm going to get above safe 100.

5181
05:26:08,910 --> 05:26:10,370
I'm pretty sure.

5182
05:26:11,990 --> 05:26:12,910
Oh, no.

5183
05:26:13,150 --> 05:26:15,730
Wait, is Ashley coming with me to the dog maze?

5184
05:26:16,210 --> 05:26:17,050
Got it.

5185
05:26:17,290 --> 05:26:17,730
No!

5186
05:26:19,030 --> 05:26:20,070
Ashley, no.

5187
05:26:21,030 --> 05:26:21,610
Ashley, no.

5188
05:26:22,430 --> 05:26:22,870
No.

5189
05:26:23,390 --> 05:26:23,930
Why?

5190
05:26:24,090 --> 05:26:26,410
Why must you come with me to the maze?

5191
05:26:27,510 --> 05:26:29,610
Can you please get kidnapped?

5192
05:26:30,410 --> 05:26:34,810
Ashley, please, can you get kidnapped right now before I go
to the maze?

5193
05:26:36,950 --> 05:26:37,590
Please.

5194
05:26:37,970 --> 05:26:39,330
I am directionless.

5195
05:26:40,470 --> 05:26:40,890
Okay.

5196
05:26:41,650 --> 05:26:44,810
Ashley, please, I am so bad with mazes, Ashley.

5197
05:26:44,990 --> 05:26:47,170
I really can't have you with me right now.

5198
05:26:47,630 --> 05:26:51,430
I am so bad with mazes, Ashley, I swear.

5199
05:26:55,550 --> 05:26:55,870
Alright.

5200
05:26:56,530 --> 05:26:57,510
They owe me money.

5201
05:26:58,490 --> 05:26:59,530
Those fucking crows.

5202
05:27:00,050 --> 05:27:01,050
I'll never forget.

5203
05:27:03,790 --> 05:27:05,430
These crows owe me money.

5204
05:27:09,010 --> 05:27:10,250
Oh, fucking God.

5205
05:27:10,390 --> 05:27:10,670

05:27:46,780 --> 05:27:50,540
Guys, I can already- Oh god, it's super dog.

5211
05:27:54,750 --> 05:27:56,390
It's super dogs.

5212
05:27:58,290 --> 05:27:58,790
Dog?

5213
05:27:59,810 --> 05:28:00,370
Doggos?

5214
05:28:01,610 --> 05:28:02,530
Where am I?

5215
05:28:03,850 --> 05:28:05,470
Oh, where am I?

5216
05:28:08,750 --> 05:28:10,230
I hear the toy.

5217
05:28:16,030 --> 05:28:17,530
Oh my god, I hate this.

5218
05:28:17,590 --> 05:28:19,450
I hate this so much.

5219
05:28:20,190 --> 05:28:21,070
Where is the toy?

5220
05:28:22,450 --> 05:28:23,710
Alright, here we go.

5221
05:28:25,610 --> 05:28:27,730
I like how people are trying to give me directions.

5222
05:28:27,970 --> 05:28:28,350
It's not.

5223
05:28:28,590 --> 05:28:29,990
Guys, it's hopeless.

5224
05:28:30,210 --> 05:28:31,570
You know damn well it's hopeless.

5225
05:28:33,190 --> 05:28:34,210
You can't fix this.

5226
05:28:34,810 --> 05:28:36,850
I know you guys think you can fix this.

5227
05:28:37,390 --> 05:28:38,910
But you can never fix this.

5228
05:28:39,710 --> 05:28:41,830
I will forever be directionless.

5229
05:28:44,370 --> 05:28:45,970
There's no fixing this.

5230
05:28:47,530 --> 05:28:49,510
Oh god, I hear the super dogs.

5231
05:28:51,090 --> 05:28:52,030
I hear them.

5232
05:28:52,170 --> 05:28:53,110
They're to my right.

5233
05:28:54,930 --> 05:28:56,470
Oh, that's all of them.

5234
05:28:56,770 --> 05:28:57,570
Wait, if I kill...

5235
05:28:57,570 --> 05:28:57,990
Oh!

5236
05:28:58,490 --> 05:29:01,410
Oh, fuck, I thought I was gonna kill all of them now!

5237
05:29:03,850 --> 05:29:05,830
Oh, my god!

5238
05:29:06,230 --> 05:29:06,590
Knife!

5239
05:29:06,890 --> 05:29:07,470
Kitchen knife!

5240
05:29:09,330 --> 05:29:14,150
I was like, okay, if I kill all of them before they got
out...

5241
05:29:18,170 --> 05:29:19,370
It didn't work.

5242
05:29:19,470 --> 05:29:22,690
I didn't manage to kill all of them before they...

5243
05:29:22,690 --> 05:29:23,790
Who would have thought...

5244
05:29:24,150 --> 05:29:27,990
Oh, and I thought I didn't kill all of them before they got
out.

5245
05:29:30,610 --> 05:29:32,190
Wow, Doki.

5246
05:29:33,490 --> 05:29:34,010
Super dog.

5247
05:29:34,330 --> 05:29:35,290
Super dog is coming.

5248
05:29:36,150 --> 05:29:37,150
Super dog is coming.

5249
05:29:41,740 --> 05:29:42,200
Which way?

5250
05:29:47,120 --> 05:29:48,300
Which way are they coming?

5251
05:29:51,500 --> 05:29:53,460
I hear them, but which way?

5252
05:29:55,220 --> 05:29:56,000
This way!

5253
05:29:57,040 --> 05:29:58,020
I fucking knew it.

5254
05:30:01,060 --> 05:30:01,940
I fucking knew it.

5255
05:30:02,060 --> 05:30:02,600
You can't hide.

5256
05:30:03,100 --> 05:30:04,220
You can't hide from me.

5257
05:30:05,940 --> 05:30:06,660
God, okay, wait.

5258
05:30:06,940 --> 05:30:07,880
How much ammo do I have?

5259
05:30:08,000 --> 05:30:09,080
Okay, we gotta...

5260
05:30:09,080 --> 05:30:10,480
Yeah, we definitely need a shotgun.

5261
05:30:12,700 --> 05:30:13,100
Okay.

5262
05:30:18,740 --> 05:30:20,300
Oh my god, there you found me.

5263
05:30:22,460 --> 05:30:23,020
There you go.

5264
05:30:23,140 --> 05:30:24,500
That's fucking right.

5265
05:30:24,940 --> 05:30:25,340
Idiot.

5266

Oh, shit!

5267
05:30:27,240 --> 05:30:28,320
Oh, okay, he doesn't know.

5268
05:30:28,720 --> 05:30:29,260
He doesn't.

5269
05:30:29,280 --> 05:30:31,820
No, we're embattled, though.

5270
05:30:32,760 --> 05:30:33,920
It's just as lost.

5271
05:30:34,640 --> 05:30:36,780
The dogs are just as lost as me.

5272
05:30:40,940 --> 05:30:41,740
Oh, hey, chessboard.

5273
05:30:42,140 --> 05:30:42,420
Nice.

5274
05:30:42,680 --> 05:30:43,280

5275
05:30:45,960 --> 05:30:46,380
Sweet.

Thank you.

5279
05:30:48,120 --> 05:30:49,940
Okay, the tiredness is taking me now.

5280
05:30:50,100 --> 05:30:51,320
Thanks for the stream, Doki.

5281
05:30:51,620 --> 05:30:52,400
It has been very fun.

5282
05:30:52,440 --> 05:30:53,840
I'll watch the rest of the VOD tomorrow.

5283
05:30:54,000 --> 05:30:55,960
Alright, thank you for watching this far.

5284
05:30:56,740 --> 05:30:58,000

05:30:58,100 --> 05:30:58,880
Have a great rest.

5286
05:30:59,120 --> 05:30:59,760
Thank you for the super chat.

5287
05:31:01,680 --> 05:31:02,780

God damn it.

5291
05:31:09,520 --> 05:31:11,080
He just fucking came in here.

5292
05:31:11,500 --> 05:31:12,820
He should try and gank me.

5293
05:31:20,120 --> 05:31:20,420
Okay.

5294
05:31:21,840 --> 05:31:23,240
I think you think I didn't see that?

5295
05:31:24,240 --> 05:31:25,420
I think I didn't see that dog?

5296
05:31:25,840 --> 05:31:26,980
Wait, did I kill him?

5297
05:31:28,240 --> 05:31:30,080
Did I, like, accidentally kill him?

5298
05:31:32,540 --> 05:31:34,820
He, like, just passed out at the end.

5299
05:31:35,120 --> 05:31:35,380
Nice.

5300
05:31:36,340 --> 05:31:36,800
Good.

5301
05:31:39,280 --> 05:31:43,320
I actually accidentally shot him.

5302
05:31:45,220 --> 05:31:46,360
Where is this area?

5303
05:31:47,440 --> 05:31:48,600

5349
05:36:26,820 --> 05:36:29,280
And then we can...

5350
05:36:29,280 --> 05:36:30,760
An extraordinary...

5351
05:36:30,760 --> 05:36:31,640
Okay, imp that.

5352
05:36:31,840 --> 05:36:34,020
Alright, if it's all different, do we...

5353
05:36:34,020 --> 05:36:34,820
Five gems.

5354
05:36:35,020 --> 05:36:35,500
How many gems?

5355
05:36:35,640 --> 05:36:36,540
One, two, three, four.

5356
05:36:37,660 --> 05:36:38,920
One, two, three, four.

5357
05:36:38,940 --> 05:36:39,440
Four, one.

05:36:39,640 --> 05:36:40,040
Six.

5359
05:36:40,240 --> 05:36:41,780
I don't think we're gonna find...

5360
05:36:43,180 --> 05:36:45,940
I don't think we're gonna find, like, four of a kind.

5361
05:36:46,220 --> 05:36:46,860
I don't think so.

5362
05:36:46,900 --> 05:36:48,980
I think that's, like, almost impossible at this point.

5363
05:36:49,960 --> 05:36:50,360
So...

5364
05:36:50,360 --> 05:36:52,000
We can have one, two...

5365
05:36:52,100 --> 05:36:53,380
Oh, yeah, there's no way.

5366
05:36:53,600 --> 05:36:54,780
Yeah, there's definitely no way.

5367
05:36:55,260 --> 05:36:56,340
There's no way we can get that.

5368
05:36:56,440 --> 05:36:57,780
We can have all of this, though.

5369
05:36:59,000 --> 05:37:00,020
The different colors.

5370
05:37:04,400 --> 05:37:05,280
And then...

5371
05:37:06,040 --> 05:37:07,420

All that money.

5386
05:37:57,740 --> 05:37:58,820
It's already gone.

5387
05:38:00,640 --> 05:38:03,380
Now I'm back in the lower tax bracket.

5388
05:38:06,140 --> 05:38:08,040
I hear the dog.

5389
05:38:08,480 --> 05:38:11,640
Wait, I just realized I don't even have shotgun shells.

5390
05:38:12,800 --> 05:38:13,100
Okay.

5391
05:38:14,160 --> 05:38:16,480
Are there any fish in the pond or did I kill them all?

5392
05:38:17,340 --> 05:38:18,780
Wait, do they respawn?

5393
05:38:19,240 --> 05:38:20,580
Wait, do the fishes respawn?

5394
05:38:20,980 --> 05:38:21,960
Oh my god.

5395
05:38:22,100 --> 05:38:23,700
This changes everything.

5396
05:38:27,660 --> 05:38:29,420
This changes everything.

5397
05:38:33,300 --> 05:38:35,080
Oh my god.

5398
05:38:36,240 --> 05:38:37,760
That fish respawned.

5399
05:38:39,020 --> 05:38:41,640
Yeah, I'd hear the dog, but he's not coming out.

5400
05:38:43,360 --> 05:38:44,580
Where's the objective?

5401
05:38:45,220 --> 05:38:46,180
I'm so lost.

5402
05:38:47,580 --> 05:38:49,300
How do we get there?

5403
05:38:55,970 --> 05:38:57,310

5404
05:38:58,290 --> 05:38:59,950

05:39:08,470 --> 05:39:11,130
Oh, I went the wrong way.

5408
05:39:11,210 --> 05:39:15,050
Okay, we're just gonna grab the treasure over there first.

05:46:14,290 --> 05:46:15,030
I can't tell.

5502
05:46:18,630 --> 05:46:21,070
Oh, it goes back to an earlier area.

5503
05:46:23,910 --> 05:46:24,890
Fast travel.

5504
05:46:25,010 --> 05:46:26,030
I love fast travel.

5505
05:46:32,280 --> 05:46:34,440
Where is this place?

5506
05:46:38,120 --> 05:46:38,780
Where am I?

5507
05:46:39,560 --> 05:46:40,040

5510
05:46:45,480 --> 05:46:48,720
It's the part where I was trying to find the fucking bell.

5511
05:46:51,220 --> 05:46:51,920
It's a bell!

5512
05:46:53,400 --> 05:46:54,940
Yeah, but I don't have any keys.

5513
05:46:55,500 --> 05:46:55,740
See?

5514
05:46:56,000 --> 05:46:57,400
I couldn't find any keys.

5515
05:46:58,080 --> 05:46:59,540
So like, there's nothing to unlock.

5516
05:47:00,220 --> 05:47:01,260
Because I don't have a key.

5517
05:47:02,100 --> 05:47:03,940
We'll come back later when we find a key.

5518
05:47:04,380 --> 05:47:04,920
This way.

5519
05:47:05,700 --> 05:47:05,980
Okay.

5520
05:47:06,260 --> 05:47:07,520
Yeah, but we don't have keys.

5521
05:47:13,970 --> 05:47:14,570

05:47:15,310 --> 05:47:16,010

05:47:18,570 --> 05:47:20,050
Who the fuck is red guy?

5525
05:47:23,230 --> 05:47:24,490
She does not come back.

5526
05:47:26,330 --> 05:47:31,310

5527
05:47:35,750 --> 05:47:38,570
Don't worry guys, I'm gonna come back everybody.

05:47:54,370 --> 05:47:55,510
Wait, is there anything here?

5533
05:47:57,230 --> 05:47:57,950

05:47:58,490 --> 05:47:59,410
It's locked.

5535
05:48:04,210 --> 05:48:04,530
Where?

5536
05:48:05,830 --> 05:48:07,330
Oh, hey, can I shoot that?

5537
05:48:08,050 --> 05:48:10,170
Actually, no, why would I shoot that?

5538
05:48:10,250 --> 05:48:10,910
I could knife it.

5539
05:48:17,750 --> 05:48:18,310
Let's see.

5540
05:48:18,410 --> 05:48:18,910
Oh, there's...

5541
05:48:18,910 --> 05:48:21,270
Oh, I forgot to shoot the medallions.

5542
05:48:21,570 --> 05:48:22,470
I almost forgot about the medallions.

5543
05:48:22,490 --> 05:48:22,910
Medallions.

5544
05:48:23,430 --> 05:48:26,050
Okay, there's a medallion above me?

5545
05:48:26,550 --> 05:48:27,470
Question mark?

5546
05:48:30,070 --> 05:48:30,670
Medallion?

5547
05:48:33,310 --> 05:48:33,910
Medallion?

5548
05:48:34,570 --> 05:48:39,470
What the fuck is...

5549
05:48:39,470 --> 05:48:40,490
Is it below me?

5550
05:48:42,110 --> 05:48:44,230
Maybe I'm gonna shoot this one first, though.

5551
05:48:46,290 --> 05:48:47,530
I'm gonna shoot that one first.

5552
05:48:48,050 --> 05:48:49,350
Since it's over there, anyway.

5553
05:48:50,830 --> 05:48:51,290
Okay.

5554
05:48:53,910 --> 05:48:55,470
We're gonna go this way.

5555
05:48:57,470 --> 05:48:59,570
Oh, what's this?

5556
05:49:02,370 --> 05:49:04,370
Okay, we need the Cerberus head.

5557
05:49:05,930 --> 05:49:07,130
Oh, what the fuck?

5558
05:49:07,650 --> 05:49:08,410
Oh, it's like here.

5559
05:49:10,070 --> 05:49:11,050
I was like, where is that?

5560
05:49:11,970 --> 05:49:13,850
Rats have infested a section of castle.

5561
05:49:14,070 --> 05:49:15,950
They're gnawing away at all the precious books.

5562
05:49:16,350 --> 05:49:18,290
But those heretics couldn't care less.

5563
05:49:18,730 --> 05:49:20,650
Okay, it's time to shoot the rats as well.

5564
05:49:21,830 --> 05:49:24,350
There's so many things to shoot.

5565
05:49:25,570 --> 05:49:27,290
So little time.

5566
05:49:28,730 --> 05:49:30,210
There's only one Leon.

5567
05:49:34,110 --> 05:49:38,310
I assume this is the library.

5568
05:49:41,130 --> 05:49:42,710
There's only one Leon.

5569
05:49:47,100 --> 05:49:48,560
Oh my god, where do I go?

5570
05:49:48,700 --> 05:49:50,300

05:49:51,840 --> 05:49:52,820
Okay, I don't know where to go.

5573
05:49:52,940 --> 05:49:54,060
There's way too many entrances.

5574
05:49:54,520 --> 05:49:57,480
There's way too many things.

5575
05:49:57,980 --> 05:49:58,540
Here.

5576
05:49:59,380 --> 05:50:01,040
And there's a symbol on the wall.

05:51:57,160 --> 05:51:57,800
Napkin.

5619
05:51:58,160 --> 05:51:58,880
That's three.

5620
05:51:59,880 --> 05:52:00,660
Two knives.

5621
05:52:00,920 --> 05:52:01,820
Wait, is there bread?

5622
05:52:04,040 --> 05:52:05,540
No, no bread.

5623
05:52:07,680 --> 05:52:10,180
Napkin, two knives, spoon fork.

5624
05:52:12,060 --> 05:52:13,020
Go here.

5625
05:52:13,320 --> 05:52:14,240
Sit here.

5626
05:52:18,130 --> 05:52:20,530
You do a lot of missions like this?

5627
05:52:20,730 --> 05:52:21,610
Okay, my turn.

5628
05:52:22,210 --> 05:52:22,750
Well, yeah.

5629
05:52:23,250 --> 05:52:23,790
Let's see.

5630
05:52:23,970 --> 05:52:25,350
I'm not used to having such good company.

5631
05:52:25,910 --> 05:52:26,250
Okay.

5632
05:52:27,250 --> 05:52:30,430
Three knives, two forks, one spoon.

5633
05:52:30,790 --> 05:52:32,530
Three knives, two forks, one spoon.

5634
05:52:32,730 --> 05:52:34,090
Three knives, two forks, one spoon.

5635
05:52:34,110 --> 05:52:34,650
Oh, I'm here.

5636
05:52:34,990 --> 05:52:35,590
I sit here.

5637
05:52:35,690 --> 05:52:37,010
This is my spot.

5638
05:52:40,860 --> 05:52:41,820
I did it.

5639
05:52:42,620 --> 05:52:42,960
Yeah!

5640
05:52:44,520 --> 05:52:45,820
We're so smart.

5641
05:52:46,440 --> 05:52:48,420
Oh, this isn't the bad snake room.

5642
05:52:48,540 --> 05:52:55,840
I thought this was the one where the fucking guy with the
knives thing, you know, like the knife arms, and then he

5643
05:52:55,840 --> 05:52:56,560
slashes me.

5644
05:52:56,640 --> 05:52:58,040
I thought it was this room.

5645
05:52:58,780 --> 05:53:01,080
It's not this room, so it's the other rooms.

5646
05:53:01,960 --> 05:53:06,800
If it's not this room, it's gonna be the other room.

5647
05:53:10,700 --> 05:53:12,580
Yeah, the cage fight.

5648
05:53:13,160 --> 05:53:14,860
I thought it was the cage fight.

5649
05:53:14,920 --> 05:53:15,920
Oh, there's the red herb.

5650
05:53:17,780 --> 05:53:17,980
Yeah.

5651
05:53:19,140 --> 05:53:21,840
Don't worry, Wolf eventually gets to that room.

5652
05:53:22,080 --> 05:53:23,020
I can feel it.

5653
05:53:24,200 --> 05:53:24,840
Check the map.

5654
05:53:25,160 --> 05:53:25,620
Dallion.

5655
05:53:27,920 --> 05:53:28,460
Dallion?

5656
05:53:28,980 --> 05:53:30,140
Oh, there it is.

5657
05:53:32,780 --> 05:53:33,320
Nice.

Actually, let's go save our game.

5670

Before we go downstairs, there's a base here anyway.

5671
05:55:08,660 --> 05:55:10,080
So it's good that I came back.

5672
05:55:10,720 --> 05:55:13,500
All right, Ashley, we're gonna save the game.

So let's save.

05:55:23,420 --> 05:55:24,000
It's okay.

Everything is fine.

5677
05:55:27,100 --> 05:55:28,020
Everything is fine.

5678
05:55:29,940 --> 05:55:30,560
I could see.

5679
05:55:30,600 --> 05:55:32,360
The lion is like in the center.

5680
05:55:33,480 --> 05:55:35,160
That worries me a little bit.

5681
05:55:35,540 --> 05:55:38,060
It tells me that I have something to worry about.

5682
05:55:40,880 --> 05:55:42,200

5720
05:58:32,240 --> 05:58:35,080
Ashley, how did you miss the flame?

5721
05:58:41,620 --> 05:58:44,460

5722
05:58:45,520 --> 05:58:49,040
There you go.

5723
05:58:49,480 --> 05:58:52,120

05:58:59,140 --> 05:58:59,940
Oh, God.

5728
05:59:00,120 --> 05:59:01,040

5729
05:59:01,120 --> 05:59:02,600
Ashley, you have...

5730
05:59:02,600 --> 05:59:03,780

5731
05:59:03,860 --> 05:59:05,160
Did you run out, Ashley?

5732
05:59:05,780 --> 05:59:05,960
Ashley.

5733
05:59:06,360 --> 05:59:07,260
Okay.

5734
05:59:09,800 --> 05:59:10,340
There we go.

5735
05:59:11,080 --> 05:59:11,840
Thank fucking god.

5736
05:59:11,960 --> 05:59:12,180
Kick!

5737
05:59:15,180 --> 05:59:17,840
Oh, I didn't waste too much ammo at least.

5738
05:59:19,040 --> 05:59:21,980
Oh, the moment I said that.

5739
05:59:23,000 --> 05:59:23,980
The moment.

5740
05:59:24,500 --> 05:59:27,420
The moment I said that, I missed two shots.

5741
05:59:28,700 --> 05:59:29,660
What is my life?

5742
05:59:31,720 --> 05:59:32,420
Yeah.

5743
05:59:33,960 --> 05:59:34,640
Nighty night.

5744
05:59:35,300 --> 05:59:35,680
Nights.

5745
05:59:37,380 --> 05:59:39,520
Okay, we won't pick her up yet.

5746
05:59:40,040 --> 05:59:40,800
Okay, now we can.

5747
05:59:41,500 --> 05:59:42,920
I have to get the loot.

5748
05:59:43,920 --> 05:59:44,700
Classic turkey.

5749
05:59:48,120 --> 05:59:49,480
Yeah, I'm okay.

5750
05:59:50,080 --> 05:59:51,740
Don't worry with your aim.

5751
05:59:52,080 --> 05:59:54,400
Don't worry, I definitely did not get burned.

5752
05:59:58,840 --> 06:00:00,220
Oh my god, give me the loot.

5753
06:00:01,000 --> 06:00:02,300
Give me the fucking loot.

5754
06:00:04,140 --> 06:00:04,860
Okay, nice.

5755
06:00:05,360 --> 06:00:05,760
Oh, hey.

5756
06:00:06,500 --> 06:00:08,040
Oh, you fucking...

5757
06:00:10,550 --> 06:00:12,590
Hey guys, I found the flash grenade.

5758
06:00:13,950 --> 06:00:15,170
Guys, don't worry.

5759
06:00:15,370 --> 06:00:16,770
Flash grenade next fight.

5760
06:00:17,190 --> 06:00:20,790
Chat, we can have the flash grenade next fight.

5761
06:00:20,970 --> 06:00:21,810
Chat, don't worry.

5762
06:00:22,790 --> 06:00:24,090
Just in time.

5763
06:00:26,490 --> 06:00:27,490
Okay, let's see.

5764
06:00:27,610 --> 06:00:28,430
We got to open this.

5765
06:00:29,590 --> 06:00:29,910
Okay.

5766
06:00:34,400 --> 06:00:35,560
All right, here you go.

5767
06:00:41,090 --> 06:00:43,390
Hey, man, is that so nice that I found it?

5768
06:00:44,510 --> 06:00:45,490
It's great, guys.

5769
06:00:46,270 --> 06:00:48,430
I found it just in time.

5770
06:00:48,590 --> 06:00:48,910
Oh, nice.

5771
06:00:49,030 --> 06:00:50,770
I knew there was a medallion here.

5772
06:00:51,430 --> 06:00:52,690
I felt it in my soul.

5773
06:00:53,850 --> 06:00:54,790
Not from the map.

5774
06:00:54,990 --> 06:00:56,010
It was from the soul.

5775
06:00:57,770 --> 06:00:59,310
I don't think they're gonna move, do you?

5776
06:00:59,890 --> 06:01:01,230
Oh, I caught the cube.

5777
06:01:02,430 --> 06:01:03,210
Wait, the cube.

5778
06:01:04,230 --> 06:01:04,770
Oh, rat!

5779
06:01:05,990 --> 06:01:06,410
Nice.

5780
06:01:06,530 --> 06:01:07,030
Nice flick.

5781
06:01:08,610 --> 06:01:09,430
That was a good flick.

5782
06:01:09,530 --> 06:01:10,130
Not gonna lie.

5783
06:01:13,330 --> 06:01:13,750
Hey.

5784
06:01:14,410 --> 06:01:15,190
Right here.

5785
06:01:19,230 --> 06:01:21,030
All right, save...

5786
06:01:21,030 --> 06:01:22,010
Wait, not save yet.

5787
06:01:22,090 --> 06:01:23,270
We gotta get the cube.

5788
06:01:24,570 --> 06:01:25,210
Cube time.

5789
06:01:29,160 --> 06:01:29,860
Oh, okay.

5790
06:01:30,020 --> 06:01:30,480
It's a puzzle.

5791
06:01:32,000 --> 06:01:32,940
Okay, no, that's a circle.

5792
06:01:34,100 --> 06:01:34,760
Where's the square?

5793
06:01:37,680 --> 06:01:38,200
Uh...

5794
06:01:38,740 --> 06:01:39,260
Uh...

5795
06:01:39,260 --> 06:01:40,320
How do I...

5796
06:01:40,320 --> 06:01:41,680
Oh, here!

5797
06:01:42,140 --> 06:01:42,500
Nice.

5798
06:01:43,920 --> 06:01:44,720

We did it!

5800
06:01:48,680 --> 06:01:51,520
The square goes in a square hole.

5801
06:01:53,880 --> 06:01:55,560
Okay, we need the...

5802
06:01:55,560 --> 06:01:57,000

5804
06:02:05,210 --> 06:02:08,170
Was there a cube treasure here?

5805
06:02:08,570 --> 06:02:08,830

5951
06:11:58,940 --> 06:12:00,300
Almost shanked.

Actually, she's fine.

6152
06:30:32,720 --> 06:30:34,160
What is this?

6153
06:30:34,600 --> 06:30:35,200
Moon.

6154
06:30:35,880 --> 06:30:36,180
Okay.

6155
06:30:37,140 --> 06:30:37,140
Moon.

6156
06:30:39,040 --> 06:30:41,280
Um, what is this?

6157
06:30:41,340 --> 06:30:42,780
Is this a star or a moon?

6158
06:30:42,940 --> 06:30:44,020
Oh wait, no.

6159
06:30:45,240 --> 06:30:48,140
Oh my god, it's right here.

6160
06:30:48,500 --> 06:30:49,960
Oh my god.

6161
06:30:50,200 --> 06:30:50,460
Okay.

6162
06:30:50,980 --> 06:30:51,560
Moon.

6163
06:30:52,400 --> 06:30:52,960
Star.

6164
06:30:55,160 --> 06:30:55,960

6165
06:30:57,500 --> 06:30:58,700
This is it?

6166
06:30:59,860 --> 06:31:00,260
No?

6167
06:31:02,720 --> 06:31:03,920
It's not the right moon?

6168
06:31:05,100 --> 06:31:05,660
How's there meant?

6169
06:31:06,880 --> 06:31:08,140
How's there more moons?

6170
06:31:09,900 --> 06:31:10,700
Oh, there we go.

6171
06:31:10,780 --> 06:31:12,040
That was a big moon.

6172
06:31:12,780 --> 06:31:12,980
Okay.

6173
06:31:13,480 --> 06:31:14,480
I had the wrong moon.

6174
06:31:15,180 --> 06:31:15,960
I sound tired.

6175
06:31:16,140 --> 06:31:17,740
I'm playing Ashley, man.

6176
06:31:21,520 --> 06:31:26,280
Anybody who will be tired playing this level, I feel like I
age 80 years playing Ashley.

6177
06:31:30,080 --> 06:31:30,580
Oh,

We're gonna finish Resident Evil next week.

6290
06:38:59,720 --> 06:39:01,660
All it took was the Ashley level.

6291
06:39:01,840 --> 06:39:03,580
Yes, 100%.

6292
06:39:03,580 --> 06:39:06,720
Ashley level is what makes or breaks the game.

6293
06:39:08,000 --> 06:39:10,440
The Ashley level is what ages me.

6294
06:39:10,840 --> 06:39:12,820
Like, I'm insane.

6295
06:39:15,000 --> 06:39:20,000
The moment we're at the Ashley level, I'm mentally checked
out.

6296
06:39:20,140 --> 06:39:22,300
I'm so fucking checked out, guys.

6297
06:39:25,120 --> 06:39:29,700
Anyway, I think I really lost the chats coming in, so I'm
going to call it here, everybody.

6298
06:39:30,000 --> 06:39:31,800
I am really tired now.

6299
06:39:32,680 --> 06:39:34,020
Like, I was fine.

6300
06:39:34,160 --> 06:39:36,040
I was fine until Ashley.

6301
06:39:36,640 --> 06:39:38,560
Then I was not so fine anymore.

6302
06:39:40,320 --> 06:39:41,220
But, yeah.

6303
06:39:41,520 --> 06:39:43,300

I hope you guys had a great time watching.

6316

As always, everybody, stay hydrated, posture check.

6317
06:40:37,500 --> 06:40:39,480
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

6318
06:40:39,600 --> 06:40:43,240
And if you stay up for me, head to bed, because you deserve
it.

I'll see you guys next time, everybody.
