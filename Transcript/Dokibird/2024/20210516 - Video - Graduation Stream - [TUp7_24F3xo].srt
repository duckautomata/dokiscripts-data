You're not going anywhere.

139
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:17,900
How dare you want to leave the server?

140
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,320
The doors are all gone.

141
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,320
I deleted the door.

142
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:29,740
The server was my sim game all along.

143
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:38,000
I actually only decided to go get a DLC recently thanks to
Next, but I promised I'd be here for the final I said, oh,

00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:43,160
She went and took the ladder out of the pool.

147
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:44,680
You may not enter a league.

148
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:46,620
Welcome to Tomato Limbo.

149
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:51,280
Our rashes are ready really soon.

150
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:54,480
It's time to eat the other tomato children, guys.

151
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,220
Why do you think I grew all these tomatoes for?

152
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,560
All right, guys.

153
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,720
I'm going to set up for the server now.

154
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:11,980
For those of you who don't know the community server, It was
a, at first it was a single player server, and where I was

155
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:19,640
trying to build a hallway, and then for the final two weeks,
you guys all wanted me to open it up to everyone, so I

156
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:25,800
decided to, so we did a community server, and I'm going
touring around all your creations, and then I made you guys,

157
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:32,420
it was like free labor to finish my hallway too, so it was
like a win-win for everyone, you get to walk the hallway,

158
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:34,500
and free labor.

159
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,260
isn't that great?

160
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,960
I had a great time.

161
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,740
So yeah, the last two days I couldn't work on it anymore.

162
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,560
So I made, I made everyone else to work on it.

163
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:51,080
I mean, a few people have died on the sky hallway.

164
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:54,300
Because I made the hallway in the sky.

165
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:56,340
And then people fell off of it.

166
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,500
Because I didn't finish the sky hallway.

167
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:01,200
And I'm sorry.

168
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:03,760
Not really though.

169
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:04,600

00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:15,140
Alright, let me, I'll put the be right back screen real

Where, where did you go?

178
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:40,100
But I saw a question about what will happen to the YouTube
videos.

179
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,440
It will remain, oh, there we go.

180
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,760
it will remain forever on YouTube.

181
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:51,940
So don't worry about the graduation vibe, because I will
upload the graduation vibe onto YouTube.

182
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,100
And also, so those, oh, it's nighttime.

Your slime's very fictional.

286
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,380
Oh no, they're my bark nights.

287
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:45,500
And look.

288
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,060
Oh, I didn't know this was here.

289
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:48,920
Look at that.

290
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:51,240
I sleep and watch myself while I sleep.

291
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:52,980
Truly, I am beautiful.

292
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:58,440
I like to watch myself while I sleep.

293
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:02,440
So I would be the last thing I see before I close my eyes.

294
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,120
And then there's my...

295
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,140
There's the little...

296
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:07,440
Park Nights, you guys are here with us too.

297
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:10,660
So, and then this is my mine shaft as well.

298
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,680
So there's like a pair of like chickens.

299
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,600
There's apparently chickens.

300
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:20,120
Someone's decided to breed some chickens in my mine shaft.

301
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:25,420
So, so I don't know where they are because the last time,
the cave chickens.

302
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,680
Yes, the cave chickens.

303
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:30,680
I don't know where they are right now, but they're in here
somewhere.

304
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:35,060
You're hearing them go there he goes or mine.

305
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,100
your cave chickens.

306
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:38,420
Yeah, there's like little cave chickens there.

307
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:39,740
So this is my mine shaft.

308
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:44,840
And I'm just slowly going towards... We're almost there.

309
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:46,240
Don't worry, we're almost there.

310
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:47,300
Don't worry, guys.

311
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,400
We're almost... Don't worry, guys.

312
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:50,600
We are here.

313
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:51,340
Look at that.

314
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:53,980
And then, this is also my mine shaft.

315
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,080
It's protection!

316
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:03,400
And then, you can go this way, or this way, which is a cave.

317
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:11,100
but we'll definitely won't be able to We'll definitely won't
be able to find a way out

318
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:21,620
No, it's extra protection every time okay if you ever watch
any zombie movie or any like movie where there's monsters

319
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:24,420
The reason why they die is that they don't close the door.

320
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:26,300
So this is extra protection.

321
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:34,380
You're welcome I these doors have saved me so many times
from monsters trying to get in there's no way in and no way

322
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:44,840
out just like the this great and anyway let's pony every
pony pony should also can one of them oh that's not supposed

323
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:55,660
to be okay one of the mods uh uh link the daily song oh so
how many doors many trees have died for this many many trees

324
00:26:55,660 --> 00:27:02,620
have died for this i'll be the toast of the extra direction
for the morning

325
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:06,880
There we go.

326
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:09,420
And we're home!

327
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:11,940
Um, we're home.

328
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:12,680
Look at that.

329
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:15,620
So these didn't exist before.

330
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:18,700
So people would just like open and close it.

331
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:21,080

underground here And then it goes here, and oh my god, it's

494

actually, it's so, so expansive.

495
00:45:12,910 --> 00:45:16,150
This hallway, what was I thinking?

496
00:45:16,470 --> 00:45:18,410
Why did I do this to everyone?

497
00:45:19,290 --> 00:45:25,190
Oh yeah, okay, okay, not gonna lie, the hallway's supposed
to be a lot shorter, and I realized, oh, free labor!

498
00:45:25,830 --> 00:45:27,870
So then I made the hallway longer for everyone.

499
00:45:30,830 --> 00:45:33,910
I was like, at first it was gonna end here.

500
00:45:35,770 --> 00:45:39,130
And then I was like, oh everyone's gonna be helping me out.

501
00:45:39,450 --> 00:45:41,850
So then I made it all the way here

502
00:45:47,790 --> 00:45:49,290
Isn't that beautiful?

503
00:45:49,550 --> 00:45:50,970

Alright, so this is the hallway.

512
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:29,650

hallway.

00:52:36,130 --> 00:52:37,210
Not realize there's...

596
00:52:37,210 --> 00:52:39,530
You're supposed to think there's no outside anymore.

597
00:52:39,550 --> 00:52:47,490
after going through my hallway after going through my
hallway you're supposed to see that outside doesn't exist

598
00:52:47,490 --> 00:52:58,910
anymore it's just doors i think everyone's like trying to
figure out how to get out right now oh shit okay this is a

599
00:52:58,910 --> 00:53:08,290
sky hallway this is a sky oh that's the quote i remember uh

600
00:53:08,290 --> 00:53:17,610

and now we're at the sky hallway you might not know this but

601
00:53:17,610 --> 00:53:27,070
we're in the sky this sky hallway has taken many many lives
chat uh many lives have been lost here for this building

602
00:53:27,070 --> 00:53:32,190
because it wasn't a very smart idea to build a hallway in
the sky

603
00:53:36,250 --> 00:53:40,870
i know the sky always view Isn't it beautiful?

604
00:53:41,430 --> 00:53:42,310
It truly is.

605
00:53:42,790 --> 00:53:45,650
You can almost see the clouds from up here.

606
00:53:45,870 --> 00:53:48,650
Is this the one where we could even stop and think if we
should?

607
00:53:49,110 --> 00:53:50,710

land the long long hallway that takes more than three days

617

675
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:23,960
Why did I hear an explosion?

676
00:58:24,380 --> 00:58:28,000
I just heard there are two sky hallways.

677
00:58:29,120 --> 00:58:30,100
Why were there...

678
00:58:30,100 --> 00:58:31,900
Was there a creeper explosion?

679
00:58:32,100 --> 00:58:34,200
Why are there several creeper explosions?

680
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:38,820
Don't you just love the view from up here?

681
00:58:40,340 --> 00:58:42,700
Don't you just love the view from up here?

682
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:50,240
Don't let Doki escape.

683
00:58:51,820 --> 00:58:53,020
Not only...

684
00:58:53,820 --> 00:58:57,700
Not only was there one sky hallway, there were two.

685
00:58:58,320 --> 00:59:01,240
So before we're ever doing a graduation stream.

686
00:59:02,580 --> 00:59:04,560
That was the plan all along.

687
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:05,660
We never leave.

688
00:59:07,020 --> 00:59:08,000
It's safe.

689
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:09,640
It's safe in here, guys.

690
00:59:09,780 --> 00:59:10,520
Come in.

691
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:11,440
Come in.

692
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:13,320
Do not worry about the monsters out.

693
00:59:13,940 --> 00:59:17,420
Come in guys, come into the hallway.

694
00:59:24,180 --> 00:59:26,900
All for the sake of safety, I'm here.

695
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:27,780
What did I miss?

696
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:32,680
It's been 20, 25 days and nights and we're still in the
hallway.

697
00:59:35,860 --> 00:59:36,340
We're still...

698
00:59:38,220 --> 00:59:39,980
Let's escape the police.

699
00:59:41,020 --> 00:59:43,200
We have hallways, doors, and dead bees.

700
00:59:48,230 --> 00:59:49,530
I'm scared now.

701
00:59:49,730 --> 00:59:50,810

702
00:59:51,330 --> 00:59:52,750

00:59:53,070 --> 00:59:55,050

What's wrong with this?

705
01:00:01,020 --> 01:00:01,480
I don't understand.

706
01:00:01,620 --> 01:00:06,980
Okay, I thought these guys were gonna fuck me with me there
And then this is my village that I've kidnapped.

the hallway gang

708
01:00:22,680 --> 01:00:25,120
Someone else reconnected.

709
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:28,620
This is my halt.

710
01:00:28,820 --> 01:00:31,220
This is Doki the hallway monitor.

711
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:36,100
Am I supposed to go anywhere here?

712
01:00:36,420 --> 01:00:37,900
Am I supposed to go inside here?

713
01:00:45,290 --> 01:00:45,570
Wait.

714
01:00:46,310 --> 01:00:46,990
What could my...

715
01:00:46,990 --> 01:00:48,970
I would have thought this was great when I...

716
01:00:50,990 --> 01:00:52,150
Wait, where are they?

717
01:00:52,550 --> 01:00:54,130
Where are the villagers?

718
01:00:54,870 --> 01:00:57,890
Oh, Roy, what did you do to the villagers, Roy?

719
01:01:00,290 --> 01:01:01,510

01:01:01,510 --> 01:01:03,810
Oh, oh, no.

721
01:01:04,110 --> 01:01:05,910
That's what he did to them.

722
01:01:11,840 --> 01:01:15,860
I have made them use free labor to them.

723
01:01:17,180 --> 01:01:18,600
They've gone insane.

724
01:01:19,020 --> 01:01:21,440
They've all had villagers are in captivity.

725
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:33,980

All right, guys.

739
01:02:34,580 --> 01:02:36,480
So, yeah, this is the underground hallway.

740
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:37,620
Isn't this beautiful?

741
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:40,160
Look, you can see some water.

742
01:02:42,380 --> 01:02:43,260
What the fuck?

743
01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:46,000
You can see a little bit of water.

744
01:02:49,740 --> 01:02:51,000
Isn't this beautiful?

745
01:02:51,240 --> 01:02:53,300
And people are dying above me.

746
01:02:54,680 --> 01:02:55,480
See, look at that.

747
01:02:55,740 --> 01:02:58,200
We're in the hallway and we don't get attacked.

748
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:00,180
Look at that, guys.

749
01:03:00,780 --> 01:03:02,960
We're in the hallway and we're safe.

750
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:04,340
This is safe.

751
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:05,940
This is safe zone.

752
01:03:06,500 --> 01:03:07,860
This is a safe place.

753
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:13,880
I'm convinced the outside doesn't exist.

754
01:03:14,600 --> 01:03:17,320
And now, not only do we have two.

755
01:03:17,340 --> 01:03:19,320
Two hallways in the sky.

756
01:03:20,300 --> 01:03:24,020
We have three hallways in the sky.

757
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:28,640
We are on hallway sky number three.

758
01:03:29,860 --> 01:03:30,780
A tree clip.

759
01:03:35,120 --> 01:03:38,720
I realized there was really no point in making a hallway in
the sky.

760
01:03:39,180 --> 01:03:40,000
Only because...

761
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:41,540
No, we can't even see the sky.

762
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:45,020
But hey, many died.

763
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:46,660
We're building this.

764
01:03:47,960 --> 01:03:50,260

Oh, it's okay.

977
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,280
This is what the hallway was for.

978
01:22:35,920 --> 01:22:37,540
This is what it was for.

979
01:22:39,700 --> 01:22:43,260
The hallway was built for this exact situation.

980
01:22:45,520 --> 01:22:49,920

Don't stare at the Enderman, by the way.

989
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,780
Remember not to stare at the Enderman in front of us.

everyone all right so let me take you my history so let me

1111
01:33:54,500 --> 01:34:02,860
take you my history before i start please bear with me
because um i was very young and and because i was very young

1112
01:34:02,860 --> 01:34:10,400
i didn't really have a sense of fashion you know little kids
when they think like oh this looks nice but it doesn't look

1113
01:34:10,400 --> 01:34:25,180
nice i thought it looked nice okay i thought it looked nice
on me all right so so let me show you in 2012 um i used to

1114
01:34:25,180 --> 01:34:35,720
have a twin i'm an only child now i'm so so i'm an only
child now What happened to the twin?

1115
01:34:35,960 --> 01:34:38,080
Well, we'll never know.

1116
01:34:38,860 --> 01:34:40,640
We'll never know.

1117
01:34:45,180 --> 01:34:46,980
The twin got eliminated.

1118
01:34:49,300 --> 01:34:50,020
Who knows?

1119
01:34:50,340 --> 01:34:51,840
There's no evidence or proof.

1120
01:34:53,180 --> 01:34:56,900
I've always been a thief since 2012.

1121
01:34:57,440 --> 01:34:58,260
I've always been a...

1122
01:34:58,260 --> 01:34:58,780
I can't see.

1123
01:34:58,880 --> 01:35:00,220
For some reason, I'm blind right now.

1124
01:35:00,340 --> 01:35:02,500
I can't see my chat for some reason.

1125
01:35:03,160 --> 01:35:03,720
I...

1126
01:35:08,520 --> 01:35:15,720
Alright, so, so I've always been a thief, but I wasn't, I
didn't have this outfit before.

1127
01:35:16,220 --> 01:35:24,400
So this was my original outfit in 2012, and I realized, hmm,
maybe beige and blue doesn't go very well.

1128
01:35:26,700 --> 01:35:32,560
So I went full blue a bit later, as you see my ex-twin over
there.

1129
01:35:36,520 --> 01:35:38,160
Can you see this?

1130
01:35:38,480 --> 01:35:39,860
It's so awesome.

1131
01:35:40,400 --> 01:35:42,840
But this was my very first outfit.

1132
01:35:43,380 --> 01:35:48,800
And my very first, like, how I like to see myself in 2012.

1133
01:35:49,580 --> 01:35:53,060
And I used to have braided, braided pigtails.

1134
01:35:53,340 --> 01:35:55,000
And so I was like, just twin tails.

1135
01:35:55,260 --> 01:35:56,900
I had braided pigtails instead.

1136
01:35:57,260 --> 01:35:58,820
And I realized, that's way too much work.

1137
01:35:59,240 --> 01:36:01,000
That's way, that's way too much work.

1138
01:36:01,040 --> 01:36:02,700
Do you know how much work braiding is?

1139
01:36:02,980 --> 01:36:04,380
So I, like that guy.

1140
01:36:04,500 --> 01:36:14,240
got rid of that so now we have our little our signature then
i got lazy then i then i got lazy

1141
01:36:17,480 --> 01:36:28,180
to enter one survive so i so that was 2012 survival the
fittest exactly so in 2014 i got my new alternate outfit so

1142
01:36:28,180 --> 01:36:35,700

1145
01:37:04,620 --> 01:37:24,120
sad though but but that was my first alternate outfit so
handsome so that was my first alternate outfit and um this

1146
01:37:24,120 --> 01:37:31,080
is a very recognized you can see the signature I've always
kept the hat I've always kept my hat and my pigtails we

1147
01:37:31,080 --> 01:37:37,820
don't we don't talk about the at the pig tails we don't talk
about that time that was cursed that was when I didn't have

1148
01:37:37,820 --> 01:37:50,120
any sense of anything I don't know how to I don't know how
colors work apparently he's alive in my heart he's gone you

1149
01:37:50,120 --> 01:38:01,680
got accepted Link he got things he's gone forever oh you
mean VTuber I've always been me I've always been me since

1150
01:38:01,680 --> 01:38:15,380
2012 since 2012 it's always been me and then after that um i
discovered the world of v-tubing and then i lost my twin and

1151
01:38:15,380 --> 01:38:19,720
then i i discovered the world of v-tubing and i lost my twin

1152
01:38:23,980 --> 01:38:33,360
so that's a big gap i've kept it's because i kept my other
outfit uh my other outfit for so long but then I realized

1153
01:38:33,360 --> 01:38:41,820
this first model was done by etc who you might know from
Iron Bortex but this was before she was really in like she

1154
01:38:41,820 --> 01:38:49,680
she was in Iron Bortex but this is before the guild was
really popular it was before the big VTuber boom it was

1155
01:38:49,680 --> 01:38:56,860
really big before the big VTuber boom so I got a commission
for etc but she was I wasn't brought through Iron Bortex at

1156
01:38:56,860 --> 01:39:09,760
that time and and at that point i was like oh uh she gave me
the design of my first uh model back in she's getting milk

1157
01:39:09,760 --> 01:39:15,840
chat he'll be back yeah he'll be he'll be back but i'm an
only child though he'll be back i'm an only child

1158
01:39:20,700 --> 01:39:30,420
so um i realized i was like well um it doesn't look i
realized Even though that design, I really love my outfit

1159
01:39:30,420 --> 01:39:31,300
back then.

1160
01:39:31,700 --> 01:39:34,720
I realized that it might have been too plain, I guess.

1161
01:39:35,140 --> 01:39:37,040
I was like, oh, that's too plain.

1162
01:39:37,300 --> 01:39:40,300
Maybe I should, could you, like, spice it up a little?

1163
01:39:40,720 --> 01:39:42,200
Do whatever you want with the model.

1164
01:39:42,380 --> 01:39:43,120
Just spice it up.

1165
01:39:43,200 --> 01:39:44,320
Do whatever you want with my outfit.

1166
01:39:44,540 --> 01:39:45,060
Spice it up.

1167
01:39:45,380 --> 01:39:52,280
And then she added, like, all these new stripes, the
accessories, the pins and everything.

1168
01:39:52,420 --> 01:39:53,640
And I'm like, perfect!

1169
01:39:55,460 --> 01:39:57,000
Because I was like, I made that.

1170
01:39:57,020 --> 01:40:00,140
Thousands to have this done.

1171
01:40:00,320 --> 01:40:01,500
I might as well add more.

1172
01:40:01,780 --> 01:40:07,940
I want more accessories because it doesn't add more to the
value Your thing is it didn't add more to the value.

1173
01:40:08,160 --> 01:40:21,000
So I was like give me more I'm getting my money's worth
That's like this is not worth a thousand I'm getting my

1174
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:22,160
money's worth

1175
01:40:27,020 --> 01:40:37,600
in 2020 in 2020 that was uh as your twin the tomato who
knows who knows i'm just an only child now what twin i never

1176
01:40:37,600 --> 01:40:49,160
had a twin guys what are you talking about i just been solo
the entire time what twin i don't see no twin here it's just

1177
01:40:49,160 --> 01:41:04,120
me where's the twin here all right never heard of them never
heard of them and then after that after that new 3D model so

1178
01:41:04,120 --> 01:41:14,160
this was the first my first live 2D model and after the same
year I also got my 3D model for it because I was like whoa I

1179
01:41:14,160 --> 01:41:22,940
can't have hand trackers but this one was done by Rika and
his guild Artemis cons and I got a 3D model because I wanted

1180
01:41:22,940 --> 01:41:30,360
to like use my hands I was like that this was back when like
i want hands how i'm gonna steal people's money if i can't

1181
01:41:30,360 --> 01:41:44,980
fucking stick it in someone's pocket and go yoink she just
turned a twin to a dog kappa and so um so this was the first

1182
01:41:44,980 --> 01:41:57,240
time uh uh this was my first 3d model uh so uh was that that
was done by like i said it was benarika and um we had lot of

1183
01:41:57,240 --> 01:41:57,460
things.

1184
01:41:57,920 --> 01:42:05,240
I feel like the only reason I used that model was to give
all the middle fingers and that was a good time and that was

1185
01:42:05,240 --> 01:42:06,200
a good time.

1186
01:42:07,060 --> 01:42:09,740
I think that was the first thing I did with the new model
guys.

1187
01:42:09,860 --> 01:42:12,400
I was like guys look what I can do.

1188
01:42:13,600 --> 01:42:17,040
Oh yeah and that's that was where the butt when the butt
hearts were born.

1189
01:42:17,400 --> 01:42:18,440
That was it.

1190
01:42:18,840 --> 01:42:19,800
Oh yeah you're right.

1191
01:42:20,020 --> 01:42:24,340
This was this was how the butt heart was born because I
couldn't make a real part.

1192
01:42:24,740 --> 01:42:26,240
Like my hands couldn't make a heart.

1193
01:42:26,380 --> 01:42:36,780
It just butt and that's where it came from yeah and i was
like there's a little hole on top of the heart like a little

1194
01:42:36,780 --> 01:42:50,220
butthole and that's where we um that's where it came from
okay the arrow but hearts and then i don't remember what

1195
01:42:50,220 --> 01:43:00,400

A great journey with all of us.

1206
01:43:37,340 --> 01:43:38,040
Thank you.

1207
01:43:38,240 --> 01:43:40,120
It really does mean a lot.

1208
01:43:43,420 --> 01:43:44,740
Oh my gosh.

1209
01:43:45,240 --> 01:43:48,160
Oh gee, it was back when I used to play Overwatch too.

1210
01:43:48,340 --> 01:43:51,260
Back in my dark times in Overwatch.

1211
01:43:54,960 --> 01:44:03,380
Alright, so this was the very first appearance of Mei Mei
and Bao Bao and it was actually by coincidence because,

1212
01:44:03,740 --> 01:44:08,580
okay, okay, the lore is that, uh, the lore, the lore.

1213
01:44:15,060 --> 01:44:18,400
I found him in the laboratory and I took them.

1214
01:44:20,220 --> 01:44:22,000
But this was the very first appearance.

1215
01:44:23,520 --> 01:44:26,540
of Mei Mei and Bao Bao in July 2020.

1216
01:44:27,540 --> 01:44:31,180
And Mei Mei is the black rabbit.

1217
01:44:31,520 --> 01:44:32,920
And Bao Bao is the white one.

1218
01:44:33,400 --> 01:44:34,860
So you guys don't know which is which.

1219
01:44:35,440 --> 01:44:38,420
Because Mei Mei means like sister.

1220
01:44:38,760 --> 01:44:39,780
And Bao Bao is just bun.

1221
01:44:39,940 --> 01:44:41,060
Because he looks like a little bun.

1222
01:44:42,320 --> 01:44:44,040
I just stole them from a lab.

1223
01:44:44,480 --> 01:44:44,840
It's okay.

1224
01:44:44,900 --> 01:44:46,060
They're using up all my money.

1225
01:44:46,460 --> 01:44:48,080
They've been ordering Uber Eats every day.

1226
01:44:48,160 --> 01:44:48,840
So that's cool.

1227
01:44:49,700 --> 01:44:51,780
Why do you think I'm always broke, guys?

1228
01:44:52,020 --> 01:44:55,260
Why do you think I'm always running out of money, everyone?

1229
01:45:00,220 --> 01:45:05,300
So that was the very first appearance of my little bunny
minions.

1230
01:45:05,840 --> 01:45:09,060
The very first time they appeared in my life.

1231
01:45:09,800 --> 01:45:13,920
And then these were the references from my 1.0.

1232
01:45:13,960 --> 01:45:15,040
This I like to call this.

1233
01:45:15,480 --> 01:45:16,360
Well, not 1.0.

1234
01:45:16,440 --> 01:45:18,020
I'll call this 1.5.

1235
01:45:18,280 --> 01:45:19,600
Oh, this was the very first.

1236
01:45:19,780 --> 01:45:22,000
These were the very first official references.

1237
01:45:22,020 --> 01:45:24,000
of my 1.5 design.

1238
01:45:24,800 --> 01:45:29,240
Left side was done by Heartpuff and the right side was done
by WK4.

1239
01:45:29,900 --> 01:45:32,180
So they're both very talented artists.

1240
01:45:32,720 --> 01:45:37,140
And just a little bit of bonus for all of you.

1241
01:45:37,800 --> 01:45:39,960
One of the first reference sheets I have.

1242
01:45:41,720 --> 01:45:46,100
One of the very first reference sheets I have of me,
basically.

1243
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:49,860
And then the next slide.

1244
01:45:50,040 --> 01:45:50,960
I think it's my alternate.

1245
01:45:51,120 --> 01:45:57,560
The alternate I just want to know this every a lot of
people's favorites this outfit was a lot of people's

1246
01:45:57,560 --> 01:46:09,560
favorites slime too so WK made me new clothes and I was like
I want 3d of this so I can move my hands with this too and

1247
01:46:09,560 --> 01:46:19,440
it was beautiful it should be beautiful simply simply my
beautiful so I can walk out in public you know because I

1248
01:46:19,440 --> 01:46:29,220
can't walk out like this all the time guys like can what the
heck like people would be like that looks like a thief hmm

1249
01:46:29,220 --> 01:46:39,900
why does she have traps everywhere that looks like a main
character of a show so i have to i had to get another outfit

1250
01:46:39,900 --> 01:46:49,420
done for myself so i could blend in i could i could blend
blend in with everyone in the public so this was my very

1251
01:46:49,420 --> 01:46:50,560
that looks like the

1252
01:46:55,340 --> 01:46:56,740
It has to tip them off.

1253
01:46:56,980 --> 01:46:59,880
That outfit, no, it's like, that can't be a thief.

1254
01:47:00,180 --> 01:47:02,200
She's wearing casual clothes.

1255
01:47:02,580 --> 01:47:04,500
She looks like a background character.

1256
01:47:08,990 --> 01:47:10,310
So that was the first.

1257
01:47:10,470 --> 01:47:12,630
Now, I think this next slide, I have a feeling what it is.

1258
01:47:12,950 --> 01:47:16,890
And I'm going to say, what I'm going to say is what could
have been.

1259
01:47:17,250 --> 01:47:18,010
What could have been?

1260
01:47:18,170 --> 01:47:21,530
So I've been, this one, I got this a while ago.

1261
01:47:21,630 --> 01:47:23,010
Like a long, a long...

1262
01:47:23,570 --> 01:47:30,830
Not a while ago, I was like, this, I don't remember when I
got this, but this was a little bit ago.

1263
01:47:31,430 --> 01:47:39,850
But before I got contacted by the bank team, I had a little,
I had a little thing I wanted to do, like, with my extra

1264
01:47:39,850 --> 01:47:40,270
cash.

1265
01:47:40,370 --> 01:47:45,410
So I was paying this off slowly by slowly, and it was, like,
with my extra cash I have that save up.

1266
01:47:45,630 --> 01:47:51,830
So, like, I would put a little bit, and I, my dream was to,
like, so let me show you what it is now, first.

1267
01:47:51,890 --> 01:47:52,590
Let me show you.

1268
01:47:53,490 --> 01:47:54,990
Oh, wait, no, this is 2.0.

1269
01:47:57,750 --> 01:47:59,930
Okay, all right, this is 2.0.

1270
01:48:02,910 --> 01:48:05,530
I was, I clearly forgot myself.

1271
01:48:05,670 --> 01:48:07,330
I forgot myself, guys.

1272
01:48:10,890 --> 01:48:11,750
Oh, I'm sorry.

1273
01:48:11,870 --> 01:48:12,730
I forgot about Clea.

1274
01:48:14,250 --> 01:48:16,210
It's hard when I'm already here.

1275
01:48:16,490 --> 01:48:17,550
Like, why am I over there?

1276
01:48:17,830 --> 01:48:20,110
Why am I over there, guys, when I'm here?

1277
01:48:24,050 --> 01:48:37,580
all right I'm sorry Clea I have too many identities guys I
can't remember all of them now there's four of me wait

1278
01:48:37,580 --> 01:48:46,920
there's so many of me don't worry I'll be an only child
again soon I'll be an only child again soon so this is I

1279
01:48:46,920 --> 01:48:54,100
feel like I talked about Clea the one I went with Clea I
talked about this before for the debut graduation stream so

1280
01:48:54,100 --> 01:49:02,040
I'll make I'll make this a bit more quick because a lot of
this was already talked about during the graduation

1281
01:49:02,040 --> 01:49:05,520
announcement stream, the re-debut slash graduation
announcement stream.

1282
01:49:06,140 --> 01:49:08,200
But I went to Klaya for 2.0.

1283
01:49:08,640 --> 01:49:11,840
2.0 because I was like, Radio K is the 20.

1284
01:49:13,200 --> 01:49:21,060
So at first, it was between the red and the blue color
scheme because the original design was inspired by the

1285
01:49:21,060 --> 01:49:25,320
Vocaloid song, Phantom Thieves, Phantom Thieves song from
Vocaloid.

1286
01:49:25,340 --> 01:49:38,180
and they're twins I'm an only child so so I decided to go
with the blue because the blue and the gray because I felt

1287
01:49:38,180 --> 01:49:46,500
like that matches well with the original colors or the
original colors and I felt like I feel like red wearing red

1288
01:49:46,500 --> 01:49:55,620
would make me much more noticeable in public like where did
she go look at this bright red color in the crowd is that

1289
01:49:55,620 --> 01:50:07,880
her so I was like maybe gray is better maybe it's like where
do she go it's okay the only person that's wearing red is

1290
01:50:07,880 --> 01:50:17,180
right there you can join and perform the reverse my toast
this so it was better for camouflage too the blending in uh

1291
01:50:17,180 --> 01:50:23,560
blending in with the crowd and everything and then we all
know about my cheeto bag over there where store my lock

1292
01:50:23,560 --> 01:50:36,040
picking stuff cheetos and my mic my mini mini trim like i
the tomato stains the merchant ah okay now i think the next

1293
01:50:36,040 --> 01:50:43,860
slide is the one i was going to talk about so what could
have been this is next one is what could have been guys what

1294
01:50:43,860 --> 01:50:52,780
could have been before the bank team uh caught me where the
bank team caught me so what could have been so my um before

1295
01:50:52,780 --> 01:51:05,280
my i had to i had that graduation announcement um my plan
was uh i love collecting i love collecting pictures of

1296
01:51:05,280 --> 01:51:12,100
myself because i'm a narcissistic uh because i'm i'm
narcissistic i love myself

1297
01:51:19,310 --> 01:51:27,070
I think we all know how much I love collecting artwork and
different clothes of myself.

1298
01:51:27,390 --> 01:51:38,210
So my plan before my graduation was that was I wanted to
collect outfits from different artists around different like

1299
01:51:38,210 --> 01:51:39,550
amazing artists around.

1300
01:51:39,710 --> 01:51:45,390
So I wanted to have like a little collection of outfits and
stuff from like instead of like alternate outfits, I just

1301
01:51:45,390 --> 01:51:48,130
have alternate outfits.

1302
01:51:49,310 --> 01:51:53,810
you guys know what i mean you guys you guys know what i mean

1303
01:51:57,420 --> 01:52:14,270
but alternate alternate universes but that was i would say
so this what this um it never got i never got rigged so i

1304
01:52:14,270 --> 01:52:24,830
only got to the point of getting uh the model or my outfit
so at that point i uh it was going to be done by Iron Vortex

1305
01:52:24,830 --> 01:52:29,110
and Art Gun, like between the two, but what could have been?

1306
01:52:29,190 --> 01:52:30,110
And we had Ito Song.

1307
01:52:30,250 --> 01:52:33,590
I was going to drink from Ito Song, where you're going to
have Ito Song.

1308
01:52:33,670 --> 01:52:36,590
Yeah, because all my faces and clothes were clip-ons, guys.

1309
01:52:36,670 --> 01:52:37,370
Don't you remember?

1310
01:52:38,050 --> 01:52:41,890
I could just easily clip on a different outfit and a
different face.

1311
01:52:42,390 --> 01:52:43,330
Easy like that.

1312
01:52:44,770 --> 01:52:49,870
Just take off, just take off my clothes.

1313
01:52:50,670 --> 01:52:52,310
Just take off my clip-ons.

1314
01:52:52,330 --> 01:53:06,950
and then clip another into the dociverse we go so this is
the docu-cinematic universe guys the docu-cinematic universe

1315
01:53:06,950 --> 01:53:15,990
so some of you guys might have been some of you guys might
have been confused about like oh where this I had this

1316
01:53:15,990 --> 01:53:23,550
outfit shown around and like different assets so like my
beer fact screen has that outfit on so you guys might have

1317
01:53:23,550 --> 01:53:29,970
been like oh where did that one come from but that was what
could have been what could have been and then there's ito

1318
01:53:29,970 --> 01:53:39,610
son and it was gonna be like flowers coming out like and a
question might be like huh but instead i get like

1319
01:53:43,370 --> 01:53:48,930
so and then we can have the little bunnies can like ride
along in incognito mode because People would think they're

1320
01:53:48,930 --> 01:53:49,610
just bags.

1321
01:53:50,010 --> 01:53:50,850
But no, no, no.

1322
01:53:51,430 --> 01:53:55,850
I don't know what they are, but at least the people would be
freaked out about them moving.

1323
01:53:57,050 --> 01:53:59,250
So yeah, that was what could have been, guys.

1324
01:53:59,390 --> 01:54:00,110
What could have been.

1325
01:54:01,450 --> 01:54:03,050
And we have a few more slides left.

1326
01:54:03,210 --> 01:54:04,330
We have a few more slides left.

1327
01:54:04,930 --> 01:54:06,830
So after that, after that.

1328
01:54:07,850 --> 01:54:09,950
Well, I'm going to talk about the different...

1329
01:54:09,950 --> 01:54:16,530
Let's just look back at the different merch I've got of
myself that I solely own because I'm a narcissist.

1330
01:54:17,050 --> 01:54:17,830
I'm a narcissist.

1331
01:54:18,850 --> 01:54:27,290
what can I say I love to hug a pillow of myself a little
tiny pillow of myself there's only one that exists there's

1332
01:54:27,290 --> 01:54:36,730
only one that exists out of all these I also have a paper
puppet this was done this paper puppet was done during my

1333
01:54:36,730 --> 01:54:46,030
1.0 outfit so it was a while ago the person I'm trying to
remember his name but but he it was before he like blew up

1334
01:54:46,030 --> 01:54:53,610
so it was very it was like he wasn't like super popular back
then because like it was 1.0 so it was around like 2018 2019

1335
01:54:53,610 --> 01:55:02,930

there it's somewhere out there um and now you got so yeah I

1337
01:55:12,410 --> 01:55:26,070
got so many around that time because I didn't know what to
do myself so much I just wanted so much and then after that

1338
01:55:26,070 --> 01:55:33,130
it's some of the little figures of myself some of the little
mini-me's of myself to look around so these are like a

as I thought I did.

1359
01:58:16,390 --> 01:58:22,210
I, I, in my head, I thought that I was gonna get 20 at both,
at best.

1360
01:58:22,870 --> 01:58:24,710
I was gonna get 20 orders.

1361
01:58:24,950 --> 01:58:26,850
And that was me, like, aiming high.

1362
01:58:27,210 --> 01:58:31,830
That was me being, like, oh, I'll be lucky if I get 20.

1363
01:58:32,290 --> 01:58:34,370
And I actually thought that.

1364
01:58:34,590 --> 01:58:35,750
I actually thought that.

1365
01:58:36,290 --> 01:58:47,330
And, um, and then, um, I, I even, like, when I opened
pre-orders, I was like, if I if I just order 20 now uh maybe

1366
01:58:47,330 --> 01:58:56,090
maybe I can like uh as I open the pre-orders I was like oh
and if I order 20 now maybe I can get them before before uh

1367
01:58:56,090 --> 01:59:05,790

bundle too I was like oh my god so I kept like at first When

like, hey, about that, 20 orders.

01:59:32,590 --> 01:59:34,570
I was like, hey, can you put, like, 15 more?

1375
01:59:34,610 --> 01:59:36,930
Like, there's no way I'm going to get above 35.

1376
01:59:37,370 --> 01:59:38,130
There's no way.

1377
01:59:38,470 --> 01:59:40,330
And then we went to 50.

1378
01:59:40,770 --> 01:59:42,590

02:01:18,850 --> 02:01:20,190
Ward, let me...

1395
02:01:22,810 --> 02:01:23,270
Okay.

1396
02:01:24,830 --> 02:01:30,210
According to all knowns of aviation, there is no way a bee
should be able to fly.

1397
02:01:30,670 --> 02:01:34,890
Its wings are too small to get his fat little body off the
ground.

1398
02:01:35,290 --> 02:01:40,170
The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care
what human think is impossible.

1399
02:01:40,790 --> 02:01:44,070
Yellow, black, yellow, black, yellow, black, yellow, black.

1400
02:01:44,190 --> 02:01:45,810
Oh, black and yellow.

1401
02:01:46,110 --> 02:01:47,310
Let's shake you up a little.

1402
02:01:47,770 --> 02:01:49,470

1419

Stop flying in the house.

1427
02:02:26,890 --> 02:02:27,390
Hey, Adam.

1428
02:02:27,970 --> 02:02:28,370
Hey, Barry.

1429
02:02:28,450 --> 02:02:29,830
Oh, fuck you guys.

1430
02:02:32,190 --> 02:02:34,570
Is that, is that fun still?

1431
02:02:34,950 --> 02:02:37,730
A little special day graduation.

1432
02:02:38,070 --> 02:02:39,270
Never thought I'd make it.

1433
02:02:39,570 --> 02:02:41,090
The three days, great school.

1434
02:02:41,330 --> 02:02:42,470
Three days, high school.

1435
02:02:42,830 --> 02:02:48,310
Those were Lige, I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around
the hive.

1436
02:02:48,550 --> 02:02:49,910
You did come back different.

1437
02:02:50,290 --> 02:02:50,970
Hi, Barry.

1438
02:02:51,390 --> 02:02:51,750
Already?

1439
02:02:52,130 --> 02:02:53,130
Growing a mustache?

1440
02:02:53,650 --> 02:02:54,350
Looks good.

1441
02:02:54,590 --> 02:02:55,570
Hear about Frankie?

1442
02:02:55,910 --> 02:02:56,250
Yeah.

1443
02:02:56,450 --> 02:02:57,350
You going to a funeral?

1444
02:02:57,690 --> 02:02:59,130
No, I'm not going.

1445
02:02:59,490 --> 02:03:00,490
Everybody knows.

1446
02:03:00,650 --> 02:03:01,910
Sting someone, you die.

1447
02:03:02,290 --> 02:03:03,630
Don't waste it on a squirrel.

1448
02:03:04,050 --> 02:03:05,170
Such a hothead.

1449
02:03:06,350 --> 02:03:08,350
I guess he could have gone out the way.

1450
02:03:09,010 --> 02:03:09,690
I love this.

1451
02:03:09,830 --> 02:03:11,950
Incorporating amusement park into your day.

1452
02:03:12,190 --> 02:03:14,010
That's why we don't need vaccinations.

1453
02:03:14,190 --> 02:03:17,270
Boy, quite a bit of pomp under your circumstances.

1454
02:03:17,970 --> 02:03:21,150
Well, Ada, mmm, today we are men.

1455
02:03:21,570 --> 02:03:25,090
We are B-men, A-men, hallelujah.

1456
02:03:25,570 --> 02:03:28,310
Students, faculty, distinguished Bs.

1457
02:03:28,450 --> 02:03:30,490
Please welcome Dean Boswell.

1458
02:03:30,890 --> 02:03:34,150
Welcome, New High City graduating class of 9-15.

1459
02:03:34,590 --> 02:03:38,350
That concludes our ceremony and begins your career at Honex
Industry.

1460
02:03:38,950 --> 02:03:40,770
Well, we pick our job today.

1461
02:03:41,050 --> 02:03:42,830
My heart is just orientation.

1462
02:03:44,190 --> 02:03:45,530
Here we go!

1463
02:03:45,970 --> 02:03:49,090
Keep your hands on talent and sign a talent on times!

1464
02:03:49,550 --> 02:03:50,710
Wonder what it'll be like!

1465
02:03:50,790 --> 02:03:51,710
A little scary!

1466
02:03:52,090 --> 02:03:56,470
Welcome to Hannex, a divisional homescone and a part of the
hexagon grow!

1467
02:03:58,170 --> 02:03:58,730
Up!

1468
02:03:59,030 --> 02:03:59,810
This is it!

1469
02:04:03,200 --> 02:04:07,200
I've worked your whole life to get to the point where you
can work your whole life!

1470
02:04:07,680 --> 02:04:12,460
Honey begins when our valley and pollen jogs bring the net
critter to the hive.

1471
02:04:12,840 --> 02:04:20,500
Our top secret formula is automatically color corrected, set
adjusted, and bubble contoured into the soothing sweet syrup

1472
02:04:20,500 --> 02:04:31,000
of its distinctive golden glow you know as honey that girl
was hot she's my cousin she is yeah we're all cousins right

1473
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:41,640
you're right as honics we constantly strive to improve every
aspect of eating food since the bees are stress testing a

1474
02:04:41,640 --> 02:04:48,480
new helmet technology what do you think he makes not enough
here we have our latest advanced the Kremlin.

1475
02:04:49,160 --> 02:04:50,100
What does that do?

1476
02:04:50,380 --> 02:04:53,260
Catches that little shaman of money that hangs after you
pour it.

1477
02:04:53,500 --> 02:04:54,580
Save us millions.

1478
02:04:55,040 --> 02:04:56,640
Can anyone work on the Kremlin?

1479
02:04:56,860 --> 02:04:57,540
Of course!

1480
02:04:57,960 --> 02:05:07,520
Most bee jobs are small ones, but bees know what every small
job, if it's not well, means a lot.

1481
02:05:08,700 --> 02:05:16,300
But choose carefully, because you'll stay in the job,
constantly trying to improve every aspect of bee existence.

1482
02:05:16,700 --> 02:05:19,760
These Dress testing, a new helmet technology.

1483
02:05:20,240 --> 02:05:21,360
What do you think he makes?

1484
02:05:21,700 --> 02:05:22,460
Not enough.

1485
02:05:22,820 --> 02:05:26,460
He only, if I'm our latest investment, the Kremlin.

1486
02:05:26,980 --> 02:05:27,920
What does that do?

1487
02:05:28,240 --> 02:05:31,120
Catches the last strand of honey that hangs after you pour
it.

1488
02:05:31,440 --> 02:05:32,380
Saves us millions.

1489
02:05:32,800 --> 02:05:34,180
Can anyone work on the Kremlin?

1490
02:05:34,380 --> 02:05:35,000
Of course.

1491
02:05:35,320 --> 02:05:37,140
Most bee jobs are small ones.

1492
02:05:37,540 --> 02:05:41,740
But bees know that every small job, if it's done well, means
a lot.

1493
02:05:41,980 --> 02:05:43,300
But choose carefully because...

1494
02:05:43,300 --> 02:05:44,200
Okay, I'm closing the...

1495
02:05:44,200 --> 02:05:45,200
I'm closing her day.

1496
02:05:47,600 --> 02:05:50,120
I thought you guys, you guys went too far.

1497
02:05:50,780 --> 02:05:52,320
You guys went too far.

1498
02:05:55,940 --> 02:05:57,920
I just kept going.

1499
02:05:58,320 --> 02:05:59,580
I'm losing him.

1500
02:06:03,240 --> 02:06:04,240
Too much.

1501
02:06:04,360 --> 02:06:05,460
It's too much.

1502
02:06:08,120 --> 02:06:10,580
I was like, no more.

1503
02:06:10,940 --> 02:06:11,940
No more.

1504
02:06:13,200 --> 02:06:16,160
Now no one has channel points.

1505
02:06:21,200 --> 02:06:25,480
Now no one has channel points anymore.

1506
02:06:35,620 --> 02:06:38,760
Think about your actions now.

1507
02:06:42,720 --> 02:06:46,860
I have in the end, this was the heist all along.

1508
02:06:47,560 --> 02:06:49,940
This was the heist on the long guys.

1509
02:06:56,260 --> 02:07:10,880
this was the this was the true heist all along guys we the
true and finalized to end all heist the end all heist all

1511
02:07:26,460 --> 02:07:27,880
Oh my god.

1512
02:07:28,200 --> 02:07:30,500
Like, I don't even know where I was.

1513
02:07:31,180 --> 02:07:31,360
Alright.

1514
02:07:33,220 --> 02:07:33,740
Alright.

1515
02:07:33,980 --> 02:07:34,840
She's my cousin.

1516
02:07:35,180 --> 02:07:35,840
She is?

1517
02:07:36,080 --> 02:07:37,040
We're all cousins.

1518
02:07:37,360 --> 02:07:38,080
Right, you're right.

1519
02:07:38,200 --> 02:07:40,880
At Honix, we call Maple Bow.

1520
02:07:41,980 --> 02:07:45,760
We constantly strive to improve every aspect of bee
existence.

1521
02:07:46,300 --> 02:07:46,820
These bees.

1522
02:07:46,900 --> 02:07:47,200
Oh, wait.

1523
02:07:47,220 --> 02:07:48,380
Am I reading this again?

1524
02:07:48,880 --> 02:07:49,520
Oh, she's not.

1525
02:07:50,240 --> 02:07:52,040
Let me skip the...

1526
02:07:52,040 --> 02:07:52,360
Wait.

1527
02:07:52,700 --> 02:07:52,960
Okay.

1528
02:07:53,160 --> 02:07:54,100
What do you think you make?

1529
02:07:54,200 --> 02:07:54,900
Not enough.

1530
02:07:54,900 --> 02:07:59,600
Well, here we have our latest, our latest advancement.

1531
02:07:59,860 --> 02:08:01,200
The Kremlin, what does he do?

1532
02:08:01,500 --> 02:08:05,120
Catches a little strand of honey that hangs after you pour
it?

1533
02:08:05,420 --> 02:08:06,200
Saves us millions.

1534
02:08:06,740 --> 02:08:08,180
Can anyone work on the Kremlin?

1535
02:08:08,380 --> 02:08:08,920
Of course.

1536
02:08:09,340 --> 02:08:15,100
Most bee jobs are small ones, but bees know that every small
job, if it's done well, means a lot.

1537
02:08:15,320 --> 02:08:19,500
But choose carefully, because you'll stay in the job today.

1538
02:08:19,900 --> 02:08:21,180

A little scary.

We're all cousins.

1570
02:10:07,000 --> 02:10:09,000
I'm going in circles.

1571
02:10:09,940 --> 02:10:10,440
Oh yeah.

1572
02:10:10,680 --> 02:10:13,060
I'm like getting rereading the same part.

1573
02:10:13,640 --> 02:10:14,600
But I'm falling.

1574
02:10:17,080 --> 02:10:18,740
Because people keep following.

1575
02:10:21,320 --> 02:10:25,120
So I kept reading the same thing over and over again.

1576
02:10:25,820 --> 02:10:26,760
Because I kept

1577
02:10:30,960 --> 02:10:32,800
Wait, we're done here.

1578
02:10:32,980 --> 02:10:34,640
We're gonna remain done here.

I've been broken.

1583
02:10:48,710 --> 02:10:51,490
This is paid back for the hallway, isn't it?

1584
02:10:51,850 --> 02:10:54,910
Now we, this is paid back for the hallway.

I didn't know what to say here but it's only been a few
weeks since I found you.

1664
02:15:28,190 --> 02:15:34,790
I'm not good with words and I'm really shy so for me it's so
difficult to talk with people but I really enjoyed every

1665
02:15:34,790 --> 02:15:36,190
stream this last week.

All my problems disappear when you hear your love.

1668
02:15:45,830 --> 02:15:47,790
I'm really sad that you're graduating.

1669
02:15:48,150 --> 02:15:49,170
I'll miss watching you.

1670
02:15:49,530 --> 02:15:53,530
I'll miss the bark nights and I'll miss staying late and
sleeping only one hour.

1671
02:15:53,950 --> 02:15:54,630
You're welcome.

1672
02:15:58,890 --> 02:15:59,590

Yeah, I know.

1676
02:16:06,490 --> 02:16:08,110
Finishing with Tamio-Pun is not the best.

1677
02:16:08,310 --> 02:16:10,090
But I really wanted to say it.

1678
02:16:10,230 --> 02:16:10,510
Aww.

1679
02:16:11,630 --> 02:16:12,570
It's okay.

1680
02:16:13,110 --> 02:16:14,390
My VODs are still.

1681
02:16:14,530 --> 02:16:16,750
Well, my VODs on YouTube are still up.

1682
02:16:16,990 --> 02:16:18,170
Just listen to the...

1683
02:16:19,230 --> 02:16:21,530
If you record it and put it in like...

1684
02:16:21,530 --> 02:16:22,870
If you have a Doki Makura.

1685
02:16:23,410 --> 02:16:24,390
Record my laugh.

1686
02:16:24,610 --> 02:16:26,070
Put it in the Doki Makura.

1687
02:16:26,490 --> 02:16:29,570
And then it's like I'm always there laughing at you.

02:16:50,350 --> 02:16:50,790
Marshmallow.

1698
02:16:52,290 --> 02:16:52,770
I'm not...

1699
02:16:52,770 --> 02:16:54,830
I just met you, but it feels like I missed...

1700
02:16:54,830 --> 02:16:57,970
It's okay as long as like you were there now before I was
gone.

1701
02:16:58,070 --> 02:16:59,430
You were there when I was alive.

1702
02:17:00,010 --> 02:17:01,030
When I was alive.

1703
02:17:01,530 --> 02:17:02,430
Remind me I'm always alive.

1704
02:17:06,510 --> 02:17:09,390
I'm not great with words or at least emotional ones.

1705
02:17:09,650 --> 02:17:14,150
Your streams have helped me keep me staying through the ups
and mostly downs of my life for the past two years.

1706
02:17:14,790 --> 02:17:16,870

02:19:43,210 --> 02:19:50,410
a lot too i feel like i'm one of the few like one of the
vtubers that don't really do a lot of collaboration streams

1744
02:19:50,410 --> 02:19:55,850
because all i really want to do is just hang out with my
chat and i feel like when i do collaboration streams i'm not

1745
02:19:55,850 --> 02:20:03,070
focusing too much on my chat i feel like oh my tension is
not really on my my chat now when i collaborate and honestly

1746
02:20:03,070 --> 02:20:12,350
i feel much happier just talking to my chat than like
collaborating with other streamers um so it's like you guys

1747
02:20:12,350 --> 02:20:18,250
just make my days so much and i always feel bad when i'm
like oh i'm ignoring chat i'm ignoring chat i just want to

1749
02:20:27,270 --> 02:20:39,390
go to the next one um why are you stitch chat into single
watchers being collaborative it with it hey dokey when i

1750
02:20:39,390 --> 02:20:45,250
first found your stream through a raid it was when you had
taken off your skin shoot and shooting your true colors as a

1751
02:20:45,250 --> 02:20:51,750
as a tomato at first i found the concept of a tomato v2
refabulous so i stayed and laughed myself a while but i was

1752
02:20:51,750 --> 02:20:57,690
listening to your content humor most especially your laugh i
decided to stay and watch never had i ever thought about my

1753
02:20:57,690 --> 02:21:04,730
decision as a bad one and i doubt i ever will finding your
stream was damn well one of the best happened to me, but

1754
02:21:04,730 --> 02:21:07,950
only a week after watching your stream, you were announcing
your graduation.

1755
02:21:08,630 --> 02:21:09,970
It felt awful seeing that.

1756
02:21:10,110 --> 02:21:12,270
The new light that I just found was so fleeting.

1757
02:21:12,690 --> 02:21:15,010
I was in a pretty big rut and felt awful.

1758
02:21:15,170 --> 02:21:21,930
I don't know why I would still be here, weren't for you, but
I guess I can count as a blessing that I found you at all,

1759
02:21:22,310 --> 02:21:22,310
huh?

1760
02:21:22,510 --> 02:21:28,850

Overwatch.

1871
02:30:59,030 --> 02:31:00,390
That was just a lie.

1872
02:31:02,710 --> 02:31:03,970
Because I'm a thief.

02:31:11,160 --> 02:31:14,180

I'll never have to play a horror game again, guys.

No more spooky mansion.

1886
02:32:31,860 --> 02:32:38,120
Portal wasn't a horror game, more so of like, I just
devolved into a caveman at the end.

1887
02:32:38,640 --> 02:32:47,020
All I could do was just up, down, Up, down, where do I go?

1888
02:32:49,860 --> 02:32:52,740
Mike, thank you so much for the raid.

1889
02:32:53,720 --> 02:32:54,640
Thank you.

1890
02:32:54,840 --> 02:32:57,880
I hope you had a great stream playing Resident Evil Village.

1891
02:32:58,200 --> 02:32:59,540
Holy shit, did you play the...

1892
02:32:59,540 --> 02:33:01,120
What difficulty did you play?

1893
02:33:01,440 --> 02:33:05,880
I heard the difficulty in the, like, what was it, the
village difficulty or whatever?

1894
02:33:06,340 --> 02:33:12,780
I heard that one was really, really hard, and people just
rage quit at the Lady D part when she's like...

1895
02:33:12,780 --> 02:33:13,980
that part.

1896
02:33:14,080 --> 02:33:22,840
I don't want to spoil, but a lot of people rage quit the
Lady D part for the hardest difficulty.

1897
02:33:24,420 --> 02:33:27,560
I saw one guy when he was at a boss fight for Lady D.

1898
02:33:27,860 --> 02:33:32,800
He spent like six hours on the boss fight and then he gave
up and went to media mode.

1899
02:33:33,160 --> 02:33:39,480
And for like six plus hours he gave up and then like swapped
the media.

1900
02:33:39,800 --> 02:33:41,600
He replayed the game all the way.

1901
02:33:42,000 --> 02:33:42,760
He restarted.

1902
02:33:42,780 --> 02:33:50,940
started the entire game because he was like why not how you
play a big vampire i think we all know how we all feel about

I'll be like, welcome back now.

1923
02:35:54,040 --> 02:35:55,540
This will be the final goodbye.

1924
02:35:56,080 --> 02:35:57,460
So this is not a hiatus.

1925
02:35:57,600 --> 02:36:04,180
I just need to reiterate that this is, I know I've done a
lot of hiatuses in my time, but this is not, I have to, I

1936
02:37:20,310 --> 02:37:20,790
Unfortunately...

02:37:20,790 --> 02:37:21,310
We're cousins.

1938
02:37:22,010 --> 02:37:22,770
Oh my god.

1939
02:37:23,150 --> 02:37:23,630
See me?

1940
02:37:24,790 --> 02:37:27,010
Unfortunately, I discovered your channel.

1941
02:37:27,110 --> 02:37:28,710
The day you announced your graduation.

1942
02:37:29,110 --> 02:37:31,810
And during the last month, I wasn't able to join because of
college.

1943
02:37:32,210 --> 02:37:33,510
Or I would be tired and fall asleep.

1944
02:37:33,670 --> 02:37:35,110
But I've been able to watch some videos.

1945
02:37:35,230 --> 02:37:35,930
And it's been fun.

1946
02:37:36,430 --> 02:37:39,710
I just want to wish you good luck with the future.

1947
02:37:39,870 --> 02:37:42,210
And thank you for brightening up my day.

1948
02:37:43,630 --> 02:37:45,570
Thank you whoever sent that message.

1949
02:37:45,750 --> 02:37:46,730
Thank you guys.

1950
02:37:46,990 --> 02:37:49,330
I just thank you everyone.

1951
02:37:51,610 --> 02:37:53,470
It really does mean a lot.

1952
02:37:53,830 --> 02:38:00,270
Like I'm just happy that even for some people, for those who
are like the short times you guys watched me, that I still

1953
02:38:00,270 --> 02:38:01,830
left an impression on all of you.

1954
02:38:02,590 --> 02:38:04,330
And that really does mean a lot.

1955
02:38:04,550 --> 02:38:05,190
It really does.

1956
02:38:05,710 --> 02:38:09,950
I'm gonna hack my Doki Makura and play streams and laugh
from inside it.

1957
02:38:12,730 --> 02:38:16,910
man remember finding out like what are you and playing that
perspective just laughing about it's sad to see you go but

1958
02:38:16,910 --> 02:38:25,730
it was fun while it lasted oh my god what was it what was
that game the game I the one that where I broke the game and

1959
02:38:25,730 --> 02:38:33,370
and I what was that perspective game again I already forgot
but and then I end up apparently there was a I ended up like

1960
02:38:33,370 --> 02:38:41,730
brute forcing my way to solving the apple game super liminal
yes super yeah I forget every game I touch and then and then

1961
02:38:41,730 --> 02:38:47,930
you guys remember the apple part so you know I never know
remember how you like solve the apple part so apparently the

1962
02:38:47,930 --> 02:38:58,810
way I solved it was not a very conventional way of solving
it the tiny apple I was not supposed to solve it like that

1963
02:38:58,810 --> 02:39:09,030
so like for some reason the tiny apple just I just made so
many apples that the tiny that one tiny apple managed to the

1964
02:39:09,030 --> 02:39:23,730
drip towards me and and then i just literally made more it
was so tiny but i did it every puzzle i did for tiny out

1965
02:39:23,730 --> 02:39:29,950
every puzzle i did in superliminal was not a very
conventional way of solving it i broke that game so many

1966
02:39:29,950 --> 02:39:34,330
times Gumi!

1967
02:39:35,430 --> 02:39:37,690
Thank you for the raid, Gumi!

1968
02:39:39,010 --> 02:39:39,990
Thank you!

1969
02:39:40,390 --> 02:39:41,650
I hope you had a great stream.

1970
02:39:41,790 --> 02:39:44,510
I saw you were playing Pokemon Snap earlier, Gumi.

1971
02:39:45,630 --> 02:39:46,870
How was it?

1972
02:39:47,030 --> 02:39:49,550
But thank you again for the raid, guys.

1973
02:39:49,730 --> 02:39:50,790

Thank you, Gumi.

1975
02:39:52,350 --> 02:39:53,950
I hope you had a great stream.

1976
02:39:55,230 --> 02:39:56,550
I'm just reading our marshmallows.

1977
02:39:56,770 --> 02:39:59,310
The final, final, final messages.

1978
02:40:00,070 --> 02:40:03,190
Oh, and good luck in your sub-a-thon tomorrow, Gumi.

1979
02:40:03,710 --> 02:40:04,370
Good luck.

1980
02:40:04,930 --> 02:40:05,230
Oh, yeah.

1981
02:40:05,330 --> 02:40:05,910
A great sub.

1982
02:40:05,990 --> 02:40:10,110
I heard like a maximum extension is like 72 hours or
something.

1983
02:40:10,390 --> 02:40:13,430
Like, it's like, Goombie, are you going to, are you going to
sleep?

1984
02:40:13,670 --> 02:40:15,110
Like, are you going to sleep?

1985
02:40:16,890 --> 02:40:19,030
Are you going to do a sleep stream, Goombie?

1986
02:40:21,270 --> 02:40:22,310
Thank you.

1987
02:40:23,610 --> 02:40:24,330
Thank you.

1988
02:40:24,490 --> 02:40:25,030
Thank you.

1989
02:40:26,310 --> 02:40:26,690
All right.

1990
02:40:27,730 --> 02:40:33,690
So, Hey, Berg, just last minute message to say, thanks for
all the laughs at first.

1991
02:40:33,710 --> 02:40:41,530
I found you on Twitter and just follow for art but I got
curious one time when I saw you streamed and we're playing

1992
02:40:41,530 --> 02:40:49,050
apex and honestly just kind of was in all watching you play
so different from what I've done myself you inspired me to

1993
02:40:49,050 --> 02:40:55,090
try more and I actually felt like I improved a lot from
there I just showed up because I was up way too late way too

1994
02:40:55,090 --> 02:41:02,790
often and it was always a blast to be around and hear that
laugh I know I stole my sword with the points but I honestly

1995
02:41:02,790 --> 02:41:05,610
glad I got to help out even if it wasn't that much.

1996
02:41:06,050 --> 02:41:06,290
You helped!

1997
02:41:06,490 --> 02:41:07,250
Is this Acer?

1998
02:41:07,490 --> 02:41:08,350
This has to be Acer.

1999
02:41:09,790 --> 02:41:12,370
You're the only one that stole the mod sword.

2000
02:41:16,730 --> 02:41:21,350
He's right now this is you because you're the only one that
stole the sword out of all of us.

2001
02:41:23,610 --> 02:41:25,270
But Acer, you helped out a lot.

2002
02:41:25,570 --> 02:41:28,070
You helped out especially the Minecraft server.

2003
02:41:28,130 --> 02:41:30,970
You helped out so much in Minecraft as well.

2004
02:41:31,250 --> 02:41:35,990
We all stole the sword at one point It was mods stealing
swords from each other.

2005
02:41:39,290 --> 02:41:44,450
I'm gonna miss hanging out with you and the rest of the bark
nights.

2006
02:41:44,990 --> 02:41:48,590
But I'm sure you're gonna keep doing amazing with what comes
next.

2007
02:41:48,730 --> 02:41:52,630
And it was really awesome seeing how much effort and thought
you kept putting into stream.

2008
02:41:52,850 --> 02:41:56,730
I think my favorite will always be seeing you cheer up
simply by going live.

2009
02:41:57,190 --> 02:41:58,570
Well, it's great to know we could help you out.

2010
02:41:58,810 --> 02:42:00,070
Okay, I'm gonna see you around.

2011
02:42:00,350 --> 02:42:01,770
I was dying for my sword.

2012
02:42:04,930 --> 02:42:17,750
whenever she'll smile I get it but you guys do not know um
we had a point where I had a thing where people could steal

2013
02:42:17,750 --> 02:42:23,310
mod from each other so like people who are non-mods can
steal swords from the mods and I thought it was like a fun

2014
02:42:23,310 --> 02:42:29,130
thing but I realized I was like okay this is gonna get
really bad because what if like we had this secret lurker

2015
02:42:29,130 --> 02:42:38,410
like a secret lurker that was like I'm gonna lurk in this
channel just to seal mine and then he bans everyone so I was

2016
02:42:38,410 --> 02:42:47,210
like maybe this isn't a good idea so I had to get rid of
that later I had to I was like you know what I realized

2017
02:42:47,950 --> 02:42:56,810
there was a there might be a secret lurker there that I
wanted to save all the points just to ban everyone refresh

2018
02:42:56,810 --> 02:43:04,770
them at our don't worry I'll refresh it guys I'll refresh it
when we get to the bottom how do you even do that it's just

2019
02:43:04,770 --> 02:43:13,750
like they just redeem the points um and they just slowly
they just slowly just bat everyone in chat not being the

2020
02:43:13,750 --> 02:43:18,470
great biggest heist of them all i gave up my server at least
feel strong man

2021
02:43:23,730 --> 02:43:30,050
all right let's see congrats on your graduation it's been a
wonderful to see your streams and hang out at the movie

to write me these messages, guys.

It really does.

2035
02:44:02,590 --> 02:44:03,630

02:44:03,710 --> 02:44:16,090
three plus days to reply to anyone it takes me that much you
don't understand typing a message to reply to someone in a

on Twitter how I reply to people like five plus days later

2038
02:44:23,250 --> 02:44:32,390

you would see me reply to like 10 plus people all at once

2039
02:44:32,390 --> 02:44:39,070
and they'll range from replies from yesterday to replies
from messages from like 10 plus days ago and i'm like sorry

Thank you for all for like hanging out this late.

I didn't think like the stream will go to this late already.

2047
02:45:14,370 --> 02:45:15,030
Thank you everyone.

2048
02:45:15,230 --> 02:45:18,150
But don't worry we're almost to the, we're very close to the
end.

2049
02:45:18,510 --> 02:45:20,030
We're very close to the end guys.

2050
02:45:20,190 --> 02:45:20,950
Do not worry.

2051
02:45:24,930 --> 02:45:29,230
What are three things you wish you knew about VTubing and
streaming before you started?

2052
02:45:29,390 --> 02:45:33,490
I'm debuting next month with no followers at all and I'm
just really excited.

2053
02:45:33,510 --> 02:45:49,230
just wanted to ask you have any cardinal wisdom to best best
bestow I was like best overwatch bestow I was like and also

2054
02:45:49,230 --> 02:45:56,370
in a few years I hope you can look back this chapter of your
life and smile I think it's really cool what you've done and

2055
02:45:56,370 --> 02:46:05,390
what you've built you've go far okay can't wait for the last
stream oh my gosh for advice lie okay this is what i'm going

2056
02:46:05,390 --> 02:46:10,670
to tell you guys you might be like what are you talking
about but i will tell you this i'll tell you this do the

2057
02:46:10,670 --> 02:46:22,390
opposite of everything i've done with my streaming career i
know like you're like what do you mean but i'm serious i'm

2058
02:46:22,390 --> 02:46:29,710
serious do the opposite of everything i've ever done with my
streaming career because like what i do is very

2059
02:46:29,710 --> 02:46:36,190
unconventional and that's why my growth has been very very
slow because like i don't i guess it's like it is sad that

2060
02:46:36,190 --> 02:46:44,890
i've got i did get rejected for a twitch partner like 40
times but it's like i did this to myself i did this to

2061
02:46:44,890 --> 02:46:52,010
myself so what i'm saying is that first off the biggest
issue with my with how i stream is that i don't i never

2062
02:46:52,010 --> 02:46:58,790
before i announced my graduation i've never like told anyone
what time i'll be streaming what day i'll be streaming and

2063
02:46:58,790 --> 02:47:02,550
when i do stream I do stream it's like 2 a.m.

2064
02:47:05,810 --> 02:47:14,990
It's like it's like 2 in the morning and usually if you want
to grow as a streamer do you not stream at 2 a.m.

2065
02:47:18,530 --> 02:47:23,910
Like there are a few degenerates out there like me that are
awake at that time and also the people on the other side of

2066
02:47:23,910 --> 02:47:34,390
the world but but it's not very good in good when it comes
to comes to growing as a

2067
02:47:37,850 --> 02:47:45,170
streamer and definitely don't definitely um definitely like
network more.

2068
02:47:45,610 --> 02:47:47,150
Me I just I was in the void.

2069
02:47:47,330 --> 02:47:53,890
I was I was in the void and locked in my discord I deleted
all the doors in my discord in my streaming room so I never

2070
02:47:53,890 --> 02:47:56,810
really like interact much with other especially in VTubing.

2071
02:47:57,030 --> 02:47:58,970
VTubing is all about networking and collaboration.

2072
02:47:59,390 --> 02:48:10,210
Not me though I like i look at v-tubing and i'm just like i
want to be pretty i want to have so many outfits and i just

2073
02:48:10,210 --> 02:48:22,670
want to talk to my chat but it's it's true though like
collaboration and networking is such so important in

2074
02:48:22,670 --> 02:48:29,750
v-tubing and i know that's awful so that definitely affected
my growth as a streamer Um, because I've been streaming on,

2075
02:48:29,870 --> 02:48:33,370
well, last year, I've been streaming consistently since
2020.

2076
02:48:34,210 --> 02:48:37,630
Um, since the beginning of 2020 was like when I started
consistently streaming.

2077
02:48:38,690 --> 02:48:41,690
And, uh, I, but I started streaming in 2017.

2078
02:48:42,250 --> 02:48:48,930
But it's just that I was so sporadic with my streams that,
um, that like I would go, like I said, I would go on to

2079
02:48:48,930 --> 02:48:58,150
this, uh, really, uh, I go on to this, uh, really like
sporadic hiatus and everything so that affected my growth

2080
02:48:58,150 --> 02:49:05,910
and all that stream consistently and yeah like those are my
advice stream consistently uh do not stream at two in the

2081
02:49:05,910 --> 02:49:16,050
morning collaborated networking i feel like at this day and
age is all about networking now um like when streamer reads

2082
02:49:16,050 --> 02:49:23,550
their messages i love reading messages i always make sure to
try and read all your messages guys i'm sorry if i ever

2083
02:49:23,550 --> 02:49:28,010
missed any because because like i I don't know, I was busy
reading the B-movie script.

2084
02:49:28,470 --> 02:49:35,370
So the B-movie script has made me very preoccupied, as you
guys know.

2085
02:49:39,570 --> 02:49:46,610
So I'm glad you guys enjoyed your time in my community and
with your cousins.

2086
02:49:48,410 --> 02:49:50,810
You get to my message in two to three days.

2087
02:49:51,330 --> 02:49:54,430
So thank you, everyone, for just being there with me.

2088
02:49:55,390 --> 02:49:57,030
It really does mean a lot.

2089
02:49:57,530 --> 02:49:58,510
It really does, guys.

2090
02:50:00,490 --> 02:50:02,970
So, yeah, just do the opposite of everything I've ever done.

2091
02:50:03,890 --> 02:50:05,570
That's my streaming career.

2092
02:50:06,810 --> 02:50:08,770
And then you too can become a Twitch partner.

2093
02:50:10,450 --> 02:50:13,330
And don't send them the B-movie script in your application.

2094
02:50:13,830 --> 02:50:14,690
Don't put the B-movie...

2095
02:50:14,690 --> 02:50:19,930
Clearly, I don't think they like the B-movie script very
much in my Twitch partner application, guys.

2096
02:50:20,330 --> 02:50:21,850
I don't think they did.

2097
02:50:23,390 --> 02:50:24,590
Don't do that, too.

2098
02:50:27,270 --> 02:50:34,390
that even as a certain meeting meeting it's been fun
watching your stream for two months and times went fast it's

2099
02:50:34,390 --> 02:50:39,130
kind of sad that you'll be graduating but it's your choice
and we can't stop you from doing what you want and finally

2100
02:50:39,130 --> 02:50:48,330
and finally good luck from your journey thank you tg3 thank
you everyone for the well wishes thank you all thank you all

2101
02:50:48,330 --> 02:50:52,510
if I wasn't graduating I would definitely write in my
application world cousins

2102
02:50:59,370 --> 02:51:03,930
But sadly I don't have a fifth attempt I don't have a fifth
attempt on that

2103
02:51:07,730 --> 02:51:10,410
How active are you going to be after your last stream?

2104
02:51:10,550 --> 02:51:14,930
You're just going to disappear in the YC And other streams?

2105
02:51:15,050 --> 02:51:15,590
Who knows?

2106
02:51:15,910 --> 02:51:17,970
It's really hard to stream when you're on the run, you know?

2107
02:51:18,370 --> 02:51:23,010
It's really hard to do anything When you're fucking running
from the cops, guys.

2108
02:51:25,550 --> 02:51:27,250
Have you ever tried Motel Internet?

2109
02:51:28,850 --> 02:51:31,010
Do the motels have internet guys?

2110
02:51:31,330 --> 02:51:32,550
Do the motels have internet guys?

2111
02:51:32,990 --> 02:51:34,050
I don't even know.

2112
02:51:34,370 --> 02:51:35,470
I'll find out later.

2113
02:51:35,770 --> 02:51:37,430
I'll find out later.

2114
02:51:39,610 --> 02:51:43,330
Gilgamesh, thank you for the 13 months at tier one.

2115
02:51:43,910 --> 02:51:44,430
Thank you!

2116
02:51:44,590 --> 02:51:52,330
Can we get some bark nights real quick for Gilgamesh for the
13 months at tier one.

2117
02:51:52,590 --> 02:51:53,750
Thank you, thank you.

2118
02:51:54,350 --> 02:51:55,910
I really do appreciate it, guys.

2119
02:51:55,910 --> 02:52:06,810
thank you so much thank you thank you everyone the final
bark nights the final bark nights hello dokey seeing as you

2120
02:52:06,810 --> 02:52:15,170
soon to be leaving forever i just want to thank you thank
you my sister passed away in november but it didn't truly

2121
02:52:15,170 --> 02:52:21,410
hit me until much more recently among other things your
streams and videos kept me happy and distracted me from

2122
02:52:21,410 --> 02:52:29,210
making any rash decisions to put it bluntly you saved my
life I decided to turn my life around on April 19th, and I

2123
02:52:29,210 --> 02:52:31,030
felt so much better since then.

2124
02:52:31,530 --> 02:52:34,710
My doubt I ever would have had the chance to do so if it
hadn't been you.

2125
02:52:35,230 --> 02:52:41,490
Your personality, charm, and infectious laugh has been the
highlight of the last seven months I spent watching you.

2126
02:52:41,950 --> 02:52:46,450
I can never thank you in love for truly reminding me that
life is indeed worth living.

2127
02:52:47,010 --> 02:52:50,050
I'll miss you forever and never stop loving you.

2128
02:52:52,290 --> 02:52:53,970
Hopefully that last part wasn't creepy.

2129
02:52:57,690 --> 02:53:00,510
But, but, oh my god.

2130
02:53:01,430 --> 02:53:05,250
Ah, whoever, whoever, whoever that sent that.

2131
02:53:05,410 --> 02:53:10,150
I'm so happy that I was able to, I was able to help you
there.

2132
02:53:10,790 --> 02:53:14,730
I'm very happy to be there for you during your dark times.

2133
02:53:15,530 --> 02:53:20,050
I'm just happy to, uh, I'm just happy.

2134
02:53:20,250 --> 02:53:20,550
I love you.

2135
02:53:20,550 --> 02:53:21,630
Have a good rest of your graduate.

2136
02:53:21,870 --> 02:53:23,230
Oh, thank you, Uncle Bear.

2137
02:53:24,070 --> 02:53:24,910
Thank you.

2138
02:53:25,910 --> 02:53:35,130
I'm just happy that I was able to help you there during your
rough time and that was able to cheer you up during that

2139
02:53:35,130 --> 02:53:35,490
time.

2140
02:53:35,670 --> 02:53:43,050
Like I said, I know I keep saying, but I just love making
people laugh.

2141
02:53:43,750 --> 02:53:47,010
And it's just, I'm just happy that I was able to do that.

2142
02:53:47,210 --> 02:53:49,890
I'm really happy to be able to do that for all of you.

2143
02:53:50,390 --> 02:53:54,650
And really, I just want you guys to feel better every bad
day.

2144
02:53:54,650 --> 02:53:59,730
And I think that's like people be like why are you laughing
so much and I'll be like what's wrong with like what you

2145
02:53:59,730 --> 02:54:08,310

2148
02:54:31,130 --> 02:54:41,650
like me having to do overwatch someone did an uninstall
overwatch I see all right honestly hey Doki honestly I

2149
02:54:41,650 --> 02:54:48,270
didn't think I get emotional over this as I have been able
to be very active for now now because of IRL stuff but wow

2150
02:54:48,270 --> 02:54:54,810
I'm literally tearing up writing this out I'm so happy to
have had all these memories to you I still have the songs in

2151
02:54:54,810 --> 02:54:57,770
it because of your old playlist before Twitch DMCA.

2152
02:54:58,250 --> 02:55:00,850
I wish I could have edited for you more, and I'd known about
this.

2153
02:55:00,950 --> 02:55:04,310
I would hunt them 10 million thousand times.

2154
02:55:05,350 --> 02:55:06,250
This is an estimate.

2155
02:55:06,970 --> 02:55:10,910
I made more time to be able to make more memories with you.

2156
02:55:11,250 --> 02:55:15,410
I honestly will cherish this time of my life that we all got
to spend together.

2157
02:55:15,910 --> 02:55:18,010
And I hope the same is for you, Sparrow.

2158
02:55:18,630 --> 02:55:20,190
Ah, you guys don't know who Sparrow is.

2159
02:55:20,230 --> 02:55:22,090
He's also been in the community for a very long time.

2160
02:55:22,190 --> 02:55:24,110
He's been there with us for very, very long.

2161
02:55:24,650 --> 02:55:28,850
And since the Overwatch game, he's also known as edit a lot
of our videos too on YouTube.

2162
02:55:29,770 --> 02:55:32,070
So, I don't know, Sparrow's here right now.

2163
02:55:32,730 --> 02:55:37,130
Because he's been very busy lately with his school and work.

2164
02:55:39,730 --> 02:55:45,070
So, it's really sweet that he managed to send a message in
before the end.

2165
02:55:45,470 --> 02:55:46,870
And I'm going to miss him.

2166
02:55:46,990 --> 02:55:48,830
He has done so much for the community too.

2167
02:55:48,970 --> 02:55:50,150
He's also one of our mods.

2168
02:55:50,670 --> 02:55:52,350
He's also one of our mods too.

2169
02:55:53,010 --> 02:55:54,570
We'll miss your energy in that city.

2170
02:55:54,650 --> 02:56:03,390
laughter thank you whoever that was thank you i'm gonna miss
your stream so much that you're such a positive ball of

2171
02:56:03,390 --> 02:56:09,310
energy and i hope the feature is kind to you wherever it is
that you're going to pursue might include making tomatoes

2172
02:56:09,310 --> 02:56:22,070
extinct don't get the last tomato just wiped out tomato town
who's next been a follower ever since your overwatch days

2173
02:56:22,070 --> 02:56:29,450
and i'm glad i stayed for the journey Chuki, thank you
Chuki, thank you for everyone that stayed since my Overwatch

2174
02:56:29,450 --> 02:56:29,910
day.

2175
02:56:30,230 --> 02:56:35,090
It's really crazy because I went through so many different
phases in my streaming career.

2176
02:56:35,230 --> 02:56:39,050
Like I went through different things I want to do because I
didn't know what I wanted to do.

2177
02:56:39,430 --> 02:56:41,130
I went through like Splatoon Overwatch.

2178
02:56:41,750 --> 02:56:43,290
Remember when I used to be an artist?

2179
02:56:43,690 --> 02:56:47,090
I don't think we... When was the last time I drew for you
guys?

2180
02:56:47,370 --> 02:56:50,110
Because I was like, you know what, I'm just going to talk to
my chat.

2181
02:56:50,590 --> 02:56:56,130
I'm just going to talk to my stream because I was like...
Because I was like, I'm really just talking anyway.

2182
02:56:56,610 --> 02:57:00,330
I was merely just talking anyway, so I might as well just
ditch the whole art part.

2183
02:57:04,350 --> 02:57:05,030
That's what you mean.

2184
02:57:05,270 --> 02:57:07,390
Yeah, never true during the art tube.

2185
02:57:07,910 --> 02:57:08,090
That's true.

2186
02:57:08,110 --> 02:57:09,590
I just wanted to be in the art category.

2187
02:57:10,210 --> 02:57:12,690
I just wanted to be in the art category.

2188
02:57:17,110 --> 02:57:17,510
Alright.

2189
02:57:18,170 --> 02:57:19,710

you for your time and effort you put into your stream.

2224
03:00:27,890 --> 03:00:30,510
I found you through a rain and I'm extremely happy that I
stayed.

2225

I want to thank you for all the laughter you brought to us.

watch Souls with the community, but nonetheless, I hope you

path of life.

because every time in movie nights I try to like be as

2231
03:01:04,430 --> 03:01:11,530

2232
03:01:11,530 --> 03:01:15,510
plus dollars to watch it legally because it'll be like like
soul.

2233
03:01:15,950 --> 03:01:17,790

Trolls I bought.

2238
03:01:28,810 --> 03:01:29,950
I even paid for trolls.

2239
03:01:30,130 --> 03:01:32,790
And that was the best decision of my life.

2240
03:01:35,010 --> 03:01:37,170
You wouldn't download a car.

2241
03:01:38,550 --> 03:01:40,950
That ad traumatized me.

2242
03:01:44,510 --> 03:01:47,050
But I'm glad y'all enjoyed, especially movie.

2243
03:01:47,130 --> 03:01:48,470

Well, movie night was so fun with all of you.

2245

I'll miss your streams and your crazy antics on streams.

2248
03:02:00,810 --> 03:02:03,010
I made new friends with some of my fellow bark knights.

2249
03:02:03,350 --> 03:02:04,770
I've never been able to meet otherwise.

2250
03:02:04,970 --> 03:02:07,910
Especially these last few weeks with stream where we've been
able to hang out.

2251
03:02:08,290 --> 03:02:10,470
I'm happy to call you a friend if you're all right with
that.

2252

I hope your future endeavors bring you good fortune,
especially since you were a thief.

It was very hard because I wanted to be a good song.

2524
03:23:28,960 --> 03:23:33,240
That was what I wanted to share with you guys for the
announcements.

2525
03:23:35,320 --> 03:23:37,460
So it was very hard picking this song.

2526
03:23:37,600 --> 03:23:45,300
And I feel like I'm not going to do very well on this song
because there's like this very high note, one for a specific

2527
03:23:45,300 --> 03:23:45,840
line.

2528
03:23:46,300 --> 03:23:47,640
And I might just sing it lower.

2529
03:23:47,880 --> 03:23:48,260
That's me.

2530
03:23:49,100 --> 03:23:49,720
Who's the real one?

2531
03:23:56,490 --> 03:24:09,470
hey we'll have our last conversation and drink our last cup
of coffee someday we might be 80 best win and think about

2532
03:24:09,470 --> 03:24:20,850
the different things we used to say all the memories of you
will just become a ghost of a smile got in the wind someday

2533
03:24:23,810 --> 03:24:24,810
the last day.

2534
03:24:30,650 --> 03:24:33,090
Oh, this is the last day.

2535
03:24:33,450 --> 03:24:35,970
I'll be graduating on May 14th.

2536
03:24:38,750 --> 03:24:41,070
It must be a surprise for all of you.

2537
03:25:05,200 --> 03:25:06,840
We're not crying.

2538
03:25:09,180 --> 03:25:12,680
I honestly had no idea how I was going to transition.

2539
03:25:13,480 --> 03:25:14,620
Today we celebrate.

2540
03:25:15,200 --> 03:25:16,280
It's final time.

2541
03:25:16,840 --> 03:25:18,360
It was so bad.

2542
03:25:18,360 --> 03:25:20,260
Relax, enjoy.

2543
03:25:20,780 --> 03:25:23,040
Let's go out with your name, shall we?

2544
03:25:28,690 --> 03:25:28,890
Oh.

2545
03:25:30,490 --> 03:25:32,210
It was but a simple raid.

2546
03:25:34,430 --> 03:25:36,910
It was a more innocent life.

2547
03:25:37,590 --> 03:25:42,270
Just got into watching these superheroes for her life and
was perusing the Twitch scene.

2548
03:25:42,950 --> 03:25:45,690
Then, some raid or else watch invaded you.

2549
03:25:46,370 --> 03:25:47,290
First I was in denial.

2550
03:25:48,010 --> 03:25:49,110
Her laugh was revealed.

2551
03:25:49,750 --> 03:25:52,130
Surely, that must be her whole schtick.

2552
03:25:52,410 --> 03:25:57,050
But after a few moments, the topic of Funko Pops arose.

2553
03:25:58,130 --> 03:26:01,650
My stone-cold heart hadn't laughed so hard and so long.

2554
03:26:01,930 --> 03:26:05,670
I had forgotten what it felt like, but I was still innocent.

2555
03:26:06,430 --> 03:26:10,190
I didn't realize this was just the beginning.

2556
03:26:11,150 --> 03:26:17,130
The more I watched, the more I became aware of the fact that
I was indeed witnessing peak content.

2557
03:26:18,010 --> 03:26:19,270
Peak content!

2558
03:26:22,410 --> 03:26:30,790
that we're not like to send just chatting and of course fun
apex times with acid and webbing and now we're so skilled at

2559
03:26:30,790 --> 03:26:36,070
the shooty game made for some great moments and hilarious
times uh yes

2560
03:26:42,670 --> 03:26:51,710
okay we know this is everyone's mom this is everyone's mom

2561
03:26:55,050 --> 03:26:57,030
What the fuck was it I supposed to do?

2562
03:27:00,510 --> 03:27:01,710
You rescued me.

2563
03:27:01,770 --> 03:27:03,610
I was like, okay, I'll just take your portal.

2564
03:27:04,170 --> 03:27:04,530
Oh, no.

2565
03:27:04,850 --> 03:27:06,730
Wait, it's in the middle of the fucking open.

2566
03:27:07,310 --> 03:27:09,330
No, you already died two times before that.

2567
03:27:09,350 --> 03:27:10,550
It's always that I says fault.

2568
03:27:10,710 --> 03:27:11,650
It's never my fault.

2569
03:27:11,730 --> 03:27:12,630
Not the second time.

2570
03:27:12,970 --> 03:27:13,150
I'm sure.

2571
03:27:13,710 --> 03:27:15,770
It's never the streamer's fault.

2572
03:27:16,130 --> 03:27:17,170
I'm streaming.

2573
03:27:17,770 --> 03:27:18,750
Kiss, kiss, kiss.

2574
03:27:19,530 --> 03:27:21,270
It was like, oopsie.

2575
03:27:21,270 --> 03:27:21,990
All right, all right.

2576
03:27:22,050 --> 03:27:23,650
I'm waiting for you guys to...

2577
03:27:24,970 --> 03:27:33,150
You know like what I said acid and what big arguing just
sound like an old married couple When they argue it's a

2578
03:27:33,150 --> 03:27:43,470
cousin's phone Big old grin on my face I started to notice
the floor a chink in the content armor a Chink in the

2579
03:27:43,470 --> 03:27:45,830
content armor you're a terrible freak

2580
03:27:50,850 --> 03:27:57,550
Seems I know I know you give more than you grow The force of
you worshiping money over anything else.

2581
03:27:59,210 --> 03:28:00,710
How dare you!

2582
03:28:01,250 --> 03:28:02,330
Back into the community.

2583
03:28:03,330 --> 03:28:04,170
The force of you...

2584
03:28:04,170 --> 03:28:04,530
No!

2585
03:28:05,590 --> 03:28:06,010
No!

2586
03:28:06,350 --> 03:28:07,910
I've been exposed!

2587
03:28:09,030 --> 03:28:11,510
It's not only just Uber Eats.

2588
03:28:12,830 --> 03:28:14,110
I feel attacked.

2589
03:28:16,010 --> 03:28:21,870
Oh, look at the mouse traveling.

2590
03:28:22,090 --> 03:28:22,110
Oh, look at the mouse traveling.

2591
03:28:24,070 --> 03:28:36,170

no oh no more nights for kurama kurama roy thank you roy

2592
03:28:36,170 --> 03:28:48,010

2593
03:28:48,010 --> 03:28:57,150

03:28:59,890 --> 03:29:01,490
Wait, are we going to keep going?

2596
03:29:01,690 --> 03:29:02,450
First knee.

2597
03:29:03,110 --> 03:29:06,730
This is so good.

2598
03:29:07,150 --> 03:29:11,990
Because a world without less would be by far your worst
crime.

2599
03:29:12,330 --> 03:29:12,370
Oh.

2600
03:29:12,510 --> 03:29:14,270
Four to five months of watching you.

2601
03:29:14,630 --> 03:29:17,270
My life has been so much more than it would have been.

2602
03:29:17,930 --> 03:29:19,930
And I value the little time I've spent.

2603
03:29:19,930 --> 03:29:21,070
Except in Trilly.

2604
03:29:22,730 --> 03:29:25,510
As most people, I am of course sad.

2605
03:29:25,630 --> 03:29:33,950
