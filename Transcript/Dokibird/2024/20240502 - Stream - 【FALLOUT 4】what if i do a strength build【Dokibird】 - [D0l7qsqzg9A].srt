00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:52,060
Wow!

Hello, everybody!

3
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,240
Hello, hello!

4
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:57,580
Oh my god.

5
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,700
Sorry, I had to push back the stream 50 minutes later
because, like, I always need, like, a little cool-down

6
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:03,800
in-between streams.

7
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:08,580
Um, I didn't expect the other stream to last for this long!

8
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:13,680
It was- it went a lot longer than I expected it.

9
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,160
I was not expecting it.

10
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:24,340
Um, to be fair, it's also- it was my own fault that the
stream did last an hour longer than it should have uh

11
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:34,740
because you know i decided to yeah i decided to prolong it a
little bit longer because i wanted to pick and choose the

12
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:41,520
placements of monopoly um i was very surprised that i did
win in the end because i thought like oh all i had to do was

13
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:46,280
land on pippa square and that was it but then like i never
got to land on it

14
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:56,600
I don't know how apparently I'm unlucky in life, but very
lucky in video games, which I don't know I don't know if

15
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:03,880
that's like better or not like I would like to be lucky in
life as well That's true.

16
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:04,320
That's true.

17
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:06,520
I wanted the true monopoly.

18
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:12,640

00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,680

If you don't want what's clearly worth so much money, Maybe
you don't understand what Dwarf is.

106
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,020
I don't know where to go.

107
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:55,220
Do I just explore Diamond City?

108
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:56,520
Hello.

109
00:10:56,620 --> 00:11:01,480
In the paper to newcomers, if the Institute grabs you in the
night, at least we warned you.

110
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:03,580
Wait, the Institute?

111
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:04,840
Institute?

112
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,060
You ain't heard of the Institute, lady?

113
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:10,440
They snatch people up at the night, and no one hears from
you.

114
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,600
It's all on the paper.

115
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:12,260
What?

116
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,500
I read up before they grab you, too.

117
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,520
Wait, who's missing?

118
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:26,620

seems every year or so someone's gone and we all know better

00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,740
Someone's gone missing, right?

00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,760

I hope the Institute takes you too.

134
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:08,940
No one tries to find missing people in Diamond City.

135
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,960
Missing people means the Institute.

attention someone can help you're a smart kid isn't there

00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:58,260
Alright.

166
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:59,600
Oh, let's see.

167
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:00,880
Oh, there's the Dragoon Buster.

168
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,120
The Knuckles.

169
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,200
The Fat is 30.

170
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,120
Okay, here we go.

171
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:04,860
Okay.

172
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:08,300
Oh, shit!

173
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:09,760
There's another Cogsword.

174
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:15,680
But in your case, I should be so disdain.

175
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:16,220
What?

176
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,400
Let me know when you're ready to order.

177
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:22,460
Oh my god, he called me poor.

178
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:23,980
Is there a problem?

179
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:25,260
No problem at all.

180
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,820
My programming dictates that I...

181
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:29,180
How do you know I'm poor?

182
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:29,900
How do you know I'm poor?

183
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:30,940
Colonial tap house.

184
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:33,260
Even those that obviously...

185
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:38,060
Just know that my senses indicate that you have dangerous...

186
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:38,720
How?

187
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,600

190
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:09,340

191
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:10,140
Hey.

192
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:16,400
Yeah, I don't object to your outsiders coming here, but you
must do insist on speaking to me.

193
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:17,020
What?

194
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,280
Oh, my God.

195
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:20,780
The robots are talking to each other.

196
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:23,060
I get to see a model remotely as...

197
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:23,600
Oh, my God.

198
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:24,940
They're talking to each other.

199
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:32,960
It's like talking to yourself.

200
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:37,010
Believe me, when I...

201
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:39,130
I do hope our paths will cross again.

202
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:42,230
Why are they, like, overlapping in volume?

203
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:44,750
Who let them speak?

204
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:46,290
They're flirting.

205
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:50,310
Where do I go?

206
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:56,210
I keep- I keep fucking accidentally wanting to break into
people's houses.

207
00:15:56,950 --> 00:15:58,690
Oh no, I actually got into a loading screen.

208
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:01,150
I tricked myself into a loading screen.

209
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:04,130
Hey, this is between me and my wife.

210
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:04,530
Whoa.

211
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:06,350
Why don't you mind your own damn business for once?

212
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:08,910
Oh god, Paul, why do you always have to make a scene?

213
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:10,410
Pour me another drink, Henry.

214
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:12,690
Damn it, Darcy, I just want you to come home.

215
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:13,550
I'll be home.

216
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:16,710
Can't believe you do this to your cook.

217
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:18,010
Do what to you, Paul.

218
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:19,010
She's an alcoholic.

219
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:22,410
You keep away from my wife, God damn it.

220
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:22,950
Whoa!

221
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:25,750
Fight, fight, fight!

222
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:26,970
Do it!

223
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:28,490
Fight!

224
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:29,150
Fight!

225
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:30,070
Come on, talk.

226
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:32,750
Oh, she's busy.

227
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:33,750
Go on.

228
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:35,290
Get out of here.

229
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:36,610
I'll be at home, Darcy.

230
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:37,930
What, did she lose?

231
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:41,530
Oh my god, she has... he has a son?

232
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:48,290
I want to talk now, or she's still drinking.

233
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:49,930
I want to talk now?

234
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:52,910
Sorry I had to see that.

235
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:55,930
Things are usually a lot quieter around here.

236
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:58,650
Perfect place to drink if you're buying.

237
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:01,270
Wait, what's that argument about?

238
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:02,010
Yeah.

239
00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:03,510
Uh, nothing much.

240
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:10,570
You see, Darcy here likes to relax and enjoy life from time
to time, and her husband Paul doesn't.

241
00:17:10,570 --> 00:17:12,430
He's not a bad guy, really.

242
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:13,590
Just a little up there.

243
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:16,770
Too bad he can't learn to relax, huh, Darcy?

244
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:18,650
I don't come here to talk about Paul.

245
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:19,430
You there.

246
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:22,350
I haven't seen you in here before.

247
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:25,430
Why don't you make yourself useful and buy me a drink or
something?

248
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:27,830
Wait, buy a drink?

249
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:29,270
Have a drink.

250
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:29,750
You know what?

251
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:30,850
Have a drink on me.

252
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:32,470
Drink away your problems.

253
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:33,330
Whatever she's having.

254
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:34,450
Well, thank you very much.

255
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:36,930
I think you and I are going to get along just fine.

256
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:37,730
Free booze.

257
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:39,230
The fastest way to your home.

258
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:40,410
Now, can I just come on?

259
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:41,710
Wait, why is it over that?

260
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:42,690
What did I do?

261
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:53,710
is it because of the how do i cap my ps in game i try to
provide a little oasis from the hardships of life names cook

262
00:17:53,710 --> 00:18:06,230
by the way henry cook let me know if i can get you anything
uh maybe later not a problem okay we gotta fix this what the

263
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:09,230
fuck happened like everything like

264
00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:17,790
Everything got fucked up in one playthrough.

265
00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:19,330
What did I do?

266
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:22,610
Oh my god.

267
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:23,790
Okay, we're gonna save.

268
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:26,010
We're gonna save here.

269
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:26,730
This is it.

270
00:18:26,810 --> 00:18:27,830
We're gonna save here.

271
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:30,350
And then we're gonna quit to desktop.

272
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:32,730
And then we're gonna play window mode.

273
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:34,670
Window mode capped the FPS.

274
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:36,450
So maybe that's it.

275
00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:39,330
It just works, guys.

276
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:40,590
You don't understand.

277
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:43,010
You never understand his vision.

278
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:45,130
Okay, play.

279
00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:46,610
Maybe it'll be better now.

280
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:47,810
I was like wondering.

281
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:48,870
I can see!

282
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:50,570
I can sing.

283
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:53,790
This is it.

284
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:54,730
See, I told you.

285
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:55,910
You always have to trust this.

286
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:57,450
Trust the process.

287
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:00,610
God, we should get Todd more money.

288
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:06,170
All right, there you go.

289
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:07,150
That should work, right?

290
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:10,730
Hey, isn't it fabulous?

291
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:12,430
Sitting up here in the stands.

292
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:14,190
to do it.

293
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:16,170
You here for a beer?

294
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:17,870
I'm just gonna do third person.

295
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:21,470
I don't like how close I don't like how close they are to
me.

296
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:24,110
Not interested.

297
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:26,550
Let me know if that changes.

298
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:27,630
I'll stop the volume.

299
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:29,110
If it's better now.

300
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:32,290
Wait, did I up the volume?

301
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:33,090
I actually forgot.

302
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:35,310
I up the volume for real this time.

303
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:37,110
Okay.

304
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:42,170
I just don't like how close they are to me.

305
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:47,610
First person I don't have like, I don't like, I have a lack
of personal space.

306
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:51,690
I'll need some personal space in between.

307
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:53,370
I don't like it.

308
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:56,590
Fine, I'll do first person.

309
00:19:57,850 --> 00:19:58,650
I actually don't know.

312
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:10,410
But it's so, everybody is so close to me.

313
00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:11,570
I don't like it.

That's what a Sith will say.

I need a minute.

324
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:29,410
A Sith is a robot, right?

325
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:30,390
Like an android?

326
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:32,210
Excuse me.

327
00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:34,510
Also, I brought up the volume a little bit, sound guy.

The newsboy cap?

00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:09,430

344
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:19,250
Why not?

345
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:20,990
I'll be your brother for you.

346
00:22:21,770 --> 00:22:22,650
It'll be fine.

347
00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:29,110
I looted so fast that I don't even know.

348
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:31,730
Alright, nice.

349
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:32,910
Okay, we need that.

350
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:35,430
And then we need the raided chest piece.

351
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:37,350
And then, is that good?

352
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:38,130
Nice.

353
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:39,250
Alright, now I look.

354
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:40,650
Oh, no, I need to take off the hat.

355
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:41,430
No hat.

356
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:42,250
Alright.

357
00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:46,990
Where's, like, where's, like, uh, Nick Valentine?

358
00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:48,370
Where is this place?

359
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:52,130
Diamond City, Diamond City Market.

360
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:54,510
How do I find local map?

361
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:56,330
Is it a local map?

362
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:57,250
Whoa.

363
00:22:59,130 --> 00:23:00,810
Where does Nick Valentine go?

364
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,680
Do you live here?

365
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:07,100
No, that's the basement.

366
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:08,580
It's in the alleyway.

367
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,420
It's in the alleyway?

368
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:11,840
There's so many alleys.

369
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,100
Which one's the right alley?

370
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:15,200
Is this an alley?

371
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:15,980
That's a school.

372
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:17,460
Oh, there it is.

373
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:17,900
Detective!

374
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,500
It has to be in the greenhouse.

375
00:23:26,410 --> 00:23:27,750
Road to freedom?

376
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:29,990
Is this not the alleyway?

377
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:34,810
I'll grab some of this.

378
00:23:36,930 --> 00:23:39,010
Ooh, I got some fruit, though.

379
00:23:42,890 --> 00:23:43,770
Wrong house.

380
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:45,450
I don't know.

381
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:47,170
I thought he would be here.

382
00:23:47,370 --> 00:23:49,530
I thought he'd just chill in the greenhouse.

383
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:52,330
Oh, it's the next door.

384
00:23:53,010 --> 00:23:54,370
Yeah, but it says detectives.

385
00:23:54,390 --> 00:24:01,750
Oh no, I'm stuck in the loading screen again I think that's
like the worst part about Fallout 4 The loading screen The

389
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,300
I'm here for the detective.

390
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:32,840
Oh, Nick.

391
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,920
Another stray coming in from the rain.

392
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:37,720
I'm too late.

393
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:40,340
Why?

394
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:41,320
It's important.

395
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:45,740
Me and my two charisma is gonna charm you.

396
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:46,680
No!

397
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:48,720
He's gone.

398
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:49,860
Missing.

399
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,420
I can't believe any clues.

400
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:54,640
Do you have any idea how I could find him?

401
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:56,760
I need to find this Tumblr man.

402
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:01,840
Malone's gang had kidnapped a young woman and he tracked
them down to their hideout in Kirk Street Station.

403
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:03,040
What the fuck is getting him alone?

404
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:04,500
Down there they use as a base.

405
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:11,300
I told Nick he was walking into a trap but he just smiled
and walked out the door like he always did.

406
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:12,500
I don't have failed Riz.

407
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,740
They're just not into me.

408
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:14,880
I want money.

409
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:15,820
I'd love to help.

410
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:18,460
But there's the small matter of expenses.

411
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:19,040
Money.

412
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:21,180
Oh, that works?

413
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:26,020
I want more.

414
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,440
Yeah, this is your fucking boss.

415
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:30,620
Don't you love him?

416
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:31,840
What?

417
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:35,700
It's gonna be a hundred now?

418
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:36,800
That's the reward.

419
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:37,380
No!

420
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:40,960
How could this happen to me?

421
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,980
Who's this skinny Malone character?

422
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:46,440
I don't know much about him, but he's from good neighbor.

423
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:49,660
And that means he's in the well-pressed suits and machine
guns.

424
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:53,700
Boy, if it says good neighbor, that means he's like a good
neighbor, right?

425
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,420
You said Malone's from good neighbor?

426
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:55,800
Yeah.

427
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:57,140
Yeah, it's a tough neighborhood.

428
00:25:57,740 --> 00:25:59,000
But it says good.

429
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:01,100
The people with power there care about two things.

430
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:02,980
Style and body count.

431
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:05,640
The greedy gets punished?

432
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,060
That can't be.

433
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:07,660
I'll find him.

434
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:08,800
You have my word.

435
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:09,680
Thank you.

436
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:11,520
Nick should be easy to spot.

437
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:15,140
He's always wearing that old hat and trench coat get up.

438
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:17,020
Please hurry.

439
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:18,180
I balanced it out.

440
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:20,160
Contours didn't like it and then he liked it again.

441
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:22,020
Alright, that's our first quest.

442
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:23,860
We're going to save Nick Valentine.

443
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:25,280
Is there anything I can borrow?

444
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:26,480
Okay.

445
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:28,260
This.

446
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:30,140
There we go.

447
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,120
I can borrow this.

448
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:33,340
All right.

449
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:34,840
All right.

450
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:35,620
Come on, Cogsworth.

451
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:38,340
We're going to go save your kind.

452
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:39,260
One of your kind.

453
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,360
Don't say I'm...

454
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:42,440
Don't say I'm racist against since now.

455
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:45,540
I'm literally saving your kind, Cogsworth.

456
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:49,000
Panoply changed me.

457
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,780
I felt the power.

458
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:55,740
Okay.

464

depressed then.

465
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:00,430
Join the club.

466
00:28:01,170 --> 00:28:01,990
Alright, we're gonna go.

467
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:07,390
Oh no, that's cyborg.

468
00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:09,830
Wait, then what's the difference between and...

469
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:11,350
Wait, then what's...

470
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:11,770
Androids?

471
00:28:14,450 --> 00:28:15,330
Are androids?

472
00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:17,710
Oh, androids just look like humans, right?

473
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:22,490
Androids are synths, so they are not actually human, but
they just look like humans.

474
00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:26,050
Yeah, so they are robots!

475
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:27,890
Then he is the same!

476
00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:29,730
Cogdorid is just less evolved.

477
00:28:32,090 --> 00:28:34,030
Yeah, they're robots then.

478
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:35,650
I can't believe it.

479
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:37,350
You guys are like, no, Doki.

480
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:42,250
I can't believe you would say that, but the Androids are
practically robots.

481
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:46,810
They're just synthetic humans.

482
00:28:46,990 --> 00:28:47,430
Exactly.

483
00:28:50,370 --> 00:28:53,570
So he's basically, he's basically like, like Cogsworth.

484
00:28:54,810 --> 00:28:56,030
Except he has legs.

485
00:28:57,130 --> 00:28:58,270
And Cogsworth doesn't.

486
00:28:58,370 --> 00:28:59,730
Yeah, Cogsworth is like...

487
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:04,090
Uh, the missing link in robot evolution.

488
00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:06,630
Alright, we gotta go find.

489
00:29:07,210 --> 00:29:08,250
Alright, where's my marker?

490
00:29:09,170 --> 00:29:10,830
Oh my god, where's my marker?

491
00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:13,290
I gotta remember how to read the map.

492
00:29:14,890 --> 00:29:15,890
First goal.

493
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:18,490
Remembering how to read the map.

494
00:29:18,730 --> 00:29:19,610
Do robots have rights?

495
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:20,350
Of course not.

496
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:25,730
And they'll never have rights.

497
00:29:26,710 --> 00:29:28,830
As long as I'm in charge.

498
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:35,030
Okay, we gotta go this way.

499
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:36,510
Uh, did I not mark it?

500
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:37,450
I thought I did.

501
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:39,430
Okay, unlikely.

502
00:29:40,090 --> 00:29:41,370
Yeah, I marked it here.

503
00:29:42,170 --> 00:29:44,770
Uh, and then...

504
00:29:44,770 --> 00:29:46,050
Oh, it's right here.

505
00:29:46,530 --> 00:29:46,830
Okay.

506
00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:48,550
Woo!

507
00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:53,550
Bad dog!

508
00:29:53,910 --> 00:29:54,850
Okay, there you go.

509
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:55,310
We're fine.

510
00:29:57,550 --> 00:29:58,070
Um...

511
00:29:58,070 --> 00:29:58,910

Never mind.

517
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:38,940
What the fuck?

518
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,600
The super mutants!

519
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:49,910
Guys, remember I saw it?

520
00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:51,890
It would be funny to go get you a strength bill.

521
00:30:55,690 --> 00:30:57,270
Wait, I'm back here.

522
00:30:57,510 --> 00:30:58,090
Okay, guys.

523

00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:23,520
Do I just need to do luck more?

718
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:24,880
In the luck tree?

719
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:26,780

What is the Idiot Savant?

00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:38,240
Everyone keeps telling me to do it.

729
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:39,080
You're not stupid.

730
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:40,360

00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:47,340
Even the game doesn't think I'm stupid.

734
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:49,020
I fucking knew it.

735
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:50,820

736
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:54,120
I fucking knew it.

737
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:55,160
The game was right.

738
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:57,980
All right, here you go.

Pistol was the key.

00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:20,160
It's always the key.

749
00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:22,760
Alright, let me eat.

Where the fuck is it?

803
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:37,300
Where's your gun?

804
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:39,160

805
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:40,860
Oh, no.

806
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:42,420
I don't know what gun he had.

807
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:44,960
He's dead now.

808
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:45,660
Alright.

809
00:46:49,860 --> 00:46:50,340
Okay.

810
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:52,600
He has to get closer.

00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:53,400
Right?

812
00:46:54,100 --> 00:46:54,500

Oh, here.

814
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:56,300
He also has a 10mm.

815
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:56,860
Whoa!

816
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:01,900
Okay, fuck this.

817
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:09,600
The 10mm has been the clutch this entire time.

818
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:11,360
A little bit of red.

819
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:12,360
It's okay.

820
00:47:12,940 --> 00:47:14,540
I need it.

821
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:17,840
Guys, I tried the strength build.

822
00:47:18,380 --> 00:47:19,680
And, like, I need more.

823
00:47:19,900 --> 00:47:23,080
Okay, like, it's too difficult to do strength right now.

824
00:47:24,140 --> 00:47:24,760
Okay.

825
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:37,400
We gotta like guys the reason why we're not doing strength
yet guys is that Is that we don't we don't have like I don't

826
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:47,200
have sim packs guys The only reason why we can't do strength
build is that we haven't invested properly in strength yet

827
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:56,240
So like there's nothing we can do I need more armor to focus
on strength We don't have the investments yet, guys.

828
00:47:58,580 --> 00:48:00,200
Like, we're so weak.

830
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:03,940

Where the fuck is my robot butler?

848
00:49:06,020 --> 00:49:07,900
This is exactly why they don't...

849
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:09,920
The robots don't deserve any rights.

850
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:10,800
Holy shit.

851
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:14,820
They can't even do a simple job as to follow me.

852
00:49:19,450 --> 00:49:21,690
I will never drop the pipe bombs.

853
00:49:22,130 --> 00:49:23,290
Wait, can I drop the...

854
00:49:23,290 --> 00:49:23,990

855
00:49:24,010 --> 00:49:24,590
pipe bomb.

856
00:49:25,450 --> 00:49:26,030
This one?

857
00:49:27,170 --> 00:49:28,310
Where is the pipe bomb?

858
00:49:28,770 --> 00:49:29,790
Oh my god, I have grenades.

859
00:49:31,050 --> 00:49:31,930
Harsh but true.

860
00:49:32,410 --> 00:49:33,470
Bro, is that even following?

861
00:49:33,630 --> 00:49:34,430

862
00:49:35,370 --> 00:49:38,350

00:49:41,450 --> 00:49:42,590
Wait, what's this?

00:49:42,950 --> 00:49:43,830
Is this the outside?

865
00:49:45,290 --> 00:49:46,790
Oh, I'm outside now.

866
00:49:47,030 --> 00:49:47,930
I went the wrong way.

867
00:49:53,740 --> 00:49:56,280
God's worth has better things to do.

868
00:49:57,840 --> 00:49:59,320
I actually went outside.

869
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:01,280
I'm trying to save Valentine.

870
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:03,320
All pipe guns are bad dokey.

871
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:04,520
But that means I can save.

872
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:05,860
I can sell it.

873
00:50:10,930 --> 00:50:13,150
It takes a thousand rats to kill you.

874
00:50:13,270 --> 00:50:14,270
That was driving me nuts.

875
00:50:14,510 --> 00:50:15,530
I had to message to say that.

876
00:50:15,890 --> 00:50:17,730
Also, the submachine gun is terrible.

877
00:50:17,890 --> 00:50:19,450
Thank you for the super chat.

878
00:50:19,650 --> 00:50:21,350

Go Cosworth.

909
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:45,760

Hit, hit, hit, hit, hit.

921
00:53:04,620 --> 00:53:07,100
Guys, I think it's a bad idea that I'm in the open, guys.

922
00:53:12,820 --> 00:53:16,880
Guys, I think, I don't think I should be in the open,
everybody.

923
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:23,440
Yeah, I'm having a lot of fun.

924
00:53:31,850 --> 00:53:32,890
Holy shit!

925
00:53:35,450 --> 00:53:36,810
Oh my god.

926
00:53:38,750 --> 00:53:40,310
He's actually doing something.

927
00:53:40,430 --> 00:53:40,830
I'm gonna run.

928
00:53:40,930 --> 00:53:42,570
There's no way he can shoot me.

929
00:53:43,910 --> 00:53:44,250
Okay.

930
00:53:45,250 --> 00:53:45,990
Head, head, head, head.

931
00:53:46,190 --> 00:53:47,270
I have to hit it.

932
00:53:47,510 --> 00:53:48,130
Nope, almost.

933
00:53:48,630 --> 00:53:49,410
No, almost there.

934
00:53:49,570 --> 00:53:50,570
Nope, oh, nope.

935
00:53:50,990 --> 00:53:53,730
That 20% should not have taken that 20% bet.

936
00:53:54,650 --> 00:53:55,010
It's okay.

937
00:53:55,090 --> 00:53:56,730
I can shoot it myself, I guess.

938
00:53:58,970 --> 00:54:00,730
Guys, guys, okay.

939
00:54:08,740 --> 00:54:09,960
I did it.

940
00:54:14,420 --> 00:54:17,540
Guys, I should not have taken that 20% bet.

941
00:54:18,100 --> 00:54:18,520
Yes.

942
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:22,660
The 20% bet was not in my favor.

943
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:26,940
Maybe I'm faster than a bullet.

944
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:28,040
You guys don't know that.

945
00:54:30,020 --> 00:54:30,820
I did it.

946
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:35,940
Okay.

947
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:38,180

00:54:57,620 --> 00:54:58,500

955
00:54:59,420 --> 00:54:59,960
What was that?

956
00:55:01,100 --> 00:55:02,420

00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:45,260
A little bit rage.

00:57:55,420 --> 00:57:56,100
Peek me.

1025
00:57:57,880 --> 00:57:59,880
Wait, if I go closer...

1026
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:04,700
I have faster fingers.

1027
00:58:06,260 --> 00:58:07,120
Oh, shit!

1028
00:58:10,690 --> 00:58:12,260
That wasn't it.

1029
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:13,340
That wasn't it.

1030
00:58:14,020 --> 00:58:14,020
Sorry.

1031
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:20,600
I thought I could like out-out shoot him.

1032
00:58:21,180 --> 00:58:21,600
No!

1033
00:58:22,740 --> 00:58:24,360
Every time!

1034
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:27,560
Every fucking time!

1035
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:31,100
I keep taking more and more stuff.

1036
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:33,260
Okay, we gotta drop this.

1037
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:36,940
We gotta drop all these machine guns.

1038
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:38,440
Okay, here we go.

1039
00:58:38,680 --> 00:58:39,780

Alright, it's this way.

1043
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:48,760
No, I need all these junk.

1044
00:58:48,840 --> 00:58:49,580
You don't understand.

1045
00:58:49,820 --> 00:58:50,880
You don't understand, dragons.

1046
00:58:56,480 --> 00:58:57,440
Oh, shit!

1047
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:02,260
The fastest fingers.

1048
00:59:04,740 --> 00:59:06,460
Oh my god, they have an oven mitt.

1049
00:59:08,100 --> 00:59:08,320

Pre-war money?

1056
00:59:22,340 --> 00:59:23,900
What can I do with pre-war money?

1057
00:59:25,640 --> 00:59:27,860
We'll drop them off at our settlement later after we find
out.

00:59:27,880 --> 00:59:28,300
my neck.

1059

01:15:37,230 --> 01:15:39,130

Oh, it was M4.

1292
01:16:27,330 --> 01:16:30,130
Skinny Malone's always got things under control.

1293
01:16:30,410 --> 01:16:30,870
Oh, yeah.

1294
01:16:31,270 --> 01:16:33,310

1295
01:16:33,730 --> 01:16:36,230
Valentine must have brought her here to rub us all out.

1296
01:16:39,970 --> 01:16:40,930
Encourage violence.

1297
01:16:41,110 --> 01:16:42,770
Oh wait, what's going on for her?

1298
01:16:43,510 --> 01:16:44,750
Oh, I actually want to know the lore.

1299
01:16:45,030 --> 01:16:45,950
Carla's a runaway.

1300
01:16:46,370 --> 01:16:48,270
Her father wanted me to bring her back home.

1301
01:16:48,910 --> 01:16:52,650
Turns out she skipped town to be with my old pal, Skinny
Malone.

1302
01:16:53,270 --> 01:16:54,230
Mob boss.

1303
01:16:54,790 --> 01:16:58,910
Never thought he'd managed to scrape together a big enough
crew to take over a vault.

1304
01:16:59,930 --> 01:17:01,870
Guess life's full of surprises.

1305
01:17:02,730 --> 01:17:04,410
Hey, who's running this show here?

1306
01:17:05,010 --> 01:17:05,910

1307
01:17:06,110 --> 01:17:06,990

I'm a real female!

1313
01:17:43,610 --> 01:17:46,350
They always gotta hit you where it hurts.

1314
01:17:46,890 --> 01:17:48,750
Now what am I gonna do about you two?

1315
01:17:49,850 --> 01:17:52,370
Skinny Malone is not skinny.

1316
01:17:52,550 --> 01:17:53,370
That sucks, bro.

1317
01:17:53,670 --> 01:17:55,690
I still see your ugly faces after that.

1318
01:17:56,170 --> 01:18:00,270
I'm gonna start shooting until there ain't no more bullets
left in this whole vault!

1319
01:18:00,930 --> 01:18:02,250
We better get out of here fast.

1320
01:18:02,250 --> 01:18:03,770
I fucking did it.

1321
01:18:03,950 --> 01:18:04,730
I knew it.

1322
01:18:06,270 --> 01:18:07,090
Oh, shit.

1323
01:18:07,250 --> 01:18:07,930
Oh, he's counting.

1324
01:18:08,110 --> 01:18:09,110
He knows how to count.

1325
01:18:11,710 --> 01:18:12,890
Where do I go?

1326
01:18:16,180 --> 01:18:17,260
I'll go here?

1327
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:19,980
Valentine, where do I...

1328
01:18:19,980 --> 01:18:20,800
Wait, where did he go?

1329
01:18:24,510 --> 01:18:25,750
Why is he taking you forever?

1330
01:18:26,330 --> 01:18:26,830
Kong's work!

1331
01:18:26,990 --> 01:18:28,550
Why are you over there?

1332
01:18:32,860 --> 01:18:33,420
Don't worry.

1333
01:18:33,480 --> 01:18:34,100
No, I did.

1334
01:18:34,220 --> 01:18:34,980
I did call.

1335
01:18:35,140 --> 01:18:38,380
He has all my inventory right now.

1336
01:18:39,640 --> 01:18:40,040
Okay.

1337
01:18:41,520 --> 01:18:42,700
Are you going to leave?

1338
01:18:43,500 --> 01:18:44,620
I'll leave first.

1339
01:18:48,220 --> 01:18:50,320
I didn't know which exit they're going to take.

1340
01:18:50,860 --> 01:18:52,460
There's so many exits.

1341
01:18:53,280 --> 01:18:53,480
It's okay.

1342
01:18:53,540 --> 01:18:54,760
I have Nick Valentine now.

1343
01:18:54,900 --> 01:18:56,540
I have to actually work on my settlement.

1344
01:18:57,400 --> 01:18:58,860
This is such a scam.

1345
01:19:01,500 --> 01:19:03,240
Why can't it be automated?

1346
01:19:03,480 --> 01:19:04,540
I don't understand.

1347
01:19:05,060 --> 01:19:07,580
Why do I have to work on the settlement?

1348
01:19:13,420 --> 01:19:15,460
It's not fair.

1349
01:19:17,280 --> 01:19:18,800
Just let them leave.

1350
01:19:19,620 --> 01:19:22,660
Well, if it's me having a fucking house.

1351
01:19:27,320 --> 01:19:30,240
I have to work for it.

1352
01:19:37,280 --> 01:19:39,980

Father, please it's time.

01:21:34,780 --> 01:21:36,780

Oh, holy Todd.

1366
01:21:39,240 --> 01:21:40,940
Please let me play the game.

1367
01:21:41,080 --> 01:21:50,480
All I want to do is go to Diamond City so I can make Nick my
companions Because I'm pretty sure he's a better companion

1368
01:21:50,480 --> 01:21:51,840
than Cogsworth.

1369
01:21:52,920 --> 01:21:53,640
Please.

1370
01:21:54,620 --> 01:21:56,560
That's all I want.

1371
01:21:59,720 --> 01:22:04,600
I spent majority of this game in this black screen.

1372
01:22:06,380 --> 01:22:07,100
Tied.

1373
01:22:07,740 --> 01:22:09,320
Oh, thank God.

1374
01:22:09,460 --> 01:22:11,440
Can I turn V-Sync off here?

1375
01:22:12,140 --> 01:22:13,260
Alright, vibration.

1376
01:22:13,500 --> 01:22:14,680
I don't think that's V-Sync.

1377
01:22:16,080 --> 01:22:17,060
No, I cannot.

1378
01:22:17,320 --> 01:22:17,560

All right, guys.

1397
01:23:08,720 --> 01:23:09,980

I knew I can feed them.

1435
01:27:37,940 --> 01:27:39,940
You guys didn't believe me at first.

1436
01:27:40,060 --> 01:27:43,400
It was like, oh, Doki, your people are gonna fucking starve.

1437
01:27:43,980 --> 01:27:46,100
I was like, no, no, they're not.

01:27:46,460 --> 01:27:47,460
They'll be fine.

1439
01:27:48,380 --> 01:27:50,980
There's no way they can starve under my rule.

1440
01:27:51,860 --> 01:27:53,260
Okay, and then...

Do we need more water?

1447
01:28:10,950 --> 01:28:12,470
Why do you need more water?

1448
01:28:13,250 --> 01:28:14,630
Okay, I guess we'll put two pumps.

I have a question for you.

1464
01:29:56,850 --> 01:29:57,630
Oh, it's you.

1465
01:29:58,030 --> 01:29:58,590
What do you want?

1466
01:29:59,470 --> 01:30:00,090
What do you want?

1467
01:30:00,330 --> 01:30:01,810
You were in the tap house before.

1468
01:30:02,110 --> 01:30:03,130
Yeah, that was me.

1469
01:30:06,910 --> 01:30:07,350
Uh...

1470
01:30:07,350 --> 01:30:08,890
What was that fight about?

1471
01:30:08,990 --> 01:30:10,270
You tried to punch out the bartender.

1472
01:30:10,490 --> 01:30:10,810
Yeah.

1473
01:30:11,270 --> 01:30:12,370
What was that all about?

1474
01:30:12,510 --> 01:30:13,650
I thought it was dead obvious.

1475
01:30:15,350 --> 01:30:17,090
Okay, to be fair, that was sort of obvious.

1476
01:30:19,010 --> 01:30:21,990
Cook decides he's bored with her and she comes crawling back
home to me.

1477
01:30:26,900 --> 01:30:27,620
Tough situation.

1478
01:30:28,200 --> 01:30:29,420
Everybody has problems.

1479
01:30:30,900 --> 01:30:32,260
No, I need your help.

1480
01:30:33,020 --> 01:30:34,240
Wait, I can do it.

1481
01:30:34,340 --> 01:30:36,160
I've got some money and I'll do it.

1482
01:30:36,500 --> 01:30:39,140
I'm going to go back and talk to him and I want you to come
with me.

1483
01:30:39,240 --> 01:30:39,660
Of course.

1484
01:30:39,800 --> 01:30:40,220
You saw?

1485
01:30:40,700 --> 01:30:42,300
You won't take me seriously otherwise.

1486
01:30:42,980 --> 01:30:44,300
I don't want to have to really hurt him.

1487
01:30:44,400 --> 01:30:46,080
I just want him to leave Darcy alone.

1488
01:30:46,640 --> 01:30:47,000
Bro.

1489
01:30:47,700 --> 01:30:48,540
Okay, I need money.

1490
01:30:48,680 --> 01:30:50,060
You're going to have to make it worth my while.

1491
01:30:50,160 --> 01:30:50,400
Yeah.

1492
01:30:53,160 --> 01:30:56,560
I can pay you, but I've only got 80 caps.

1493
01:30:58,080 --> 01:30:58,720
I hope it's enough.

1494
01:31:01,060 --> 01:31:01,660
All right.

1495
01:31:02,100 --> 01:31:02,560
I'll help.

01:31:03,820 --> 01:31:05,140
Sign me up.

1497
01:31:05,240 --> 01:31:07,200
It's okay, Cosworth, if you don't like it.

1498
01:31:07,600 --> 01:31:10,440
I have Nick Valentine to replace you.

1499
01:31:13,660 --> 01:31:14,540
Wait, why do you need me?

1500
01:31:14,820 --> 01:31:17,940
If you were just going to talk to him, why do you need me
along?

1501
01:31:18,100 --> 01:31:25,000
I don't want to hurt Cook, but if he doesn't listen to me,
might do you won't dare act so smug when he sees you at my

Okay.

1507
01:31:57,720 --> 01:31:58,580
I'll help you.

1508
01:31:58,800 --> 01:31:59,080
Okay.

Good.

1510
01:32:00,280 --> 01:32:00,540
Good.

1511
01:32:01,200 --> 01:32:04,080
I'm sure Cook will back down once he sees you're with me.

1512
01:32:04,960 --> 01:32:05,380
Oh, okay.

1513
01:32:05,460 --> 01:32:05,920
Let's go.

1514
01:32:06,220 --> 01:32:06,480
Okay.

1515
01:32:06,900 --> 01:32:07,740
I'll do it alone.

1516
01:32:07,940 --> 01:32:08,740
Yeah, I'll do it alone.

1517
01:32:09,080 --> 01:32:11,800
This will work better if I talk to Cook by myself.

1518
01:32:12,020 --> 01:32:12,740
I don't think so.

1519
01:32:13,040 --> 01:32:14,640
Cook might try and talk his way out of it.

1520
01:32:14,740 --> 01:32:15,300
And you don't know him.

1521
01:32:15,420 --> 01:32:15,820
No!

1522
01:32:16,240 --> 01:32:18,280
Now I can't just shoot him!

1523
01:32:18,960 --> 01:32:19,560
Oh, nice.

1524
01:32:19,600 --> 01:32:20,060
I got $80.

1525
01:32:20,260 --> 01:32:21,020
Doesn't matter anyway.

1526
01:32:25,560 --> 01:32:26,220
It's alright.

1527
01:32:26,300 --> 01:32:27,040
I got $80.

1528
01:32:27,680 --> 01:32:28,260
So I'm fine.

1529
01:32:30,040 --> 01:32:32,060
It's because he has eyes for his wife only.

1530
01:32:32,180 --> 01:32:33,840
That's why my wrist doesn't work, guys.

1531
01:32:34,760 --> 01:32:39,660
Guys, he's a lawyer to his cheating wife.

1532
01:32:40,460 --> 01:32:43,340
And which I honestly, you deserve better, man.

1533
01:32:43,460 --> 01:32:44,080
You deserve better.

1534
01:32:44,380 --> 01:32:46,340
How would you even know that son is yours?

1535
01:32:46,620 --> 01:32:48,180
That could be the other guys.

1536
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:50,960
Paul, where are you going?

1537
01:32:51,280 --> 01:32:52,600
Nowhere you need to worry about.

1538
01:32:54,300 --> 01:32:55,920
It's- I don't have zero risk.

1539
01:32:56,120 --> 01:32:57,300
He literally has a wife.

1540
01:33:00,080 --> 01:33:01,860
I literally- he literally has a wife.

1541
01:33:02,020 --> 01:33:03,740
His eyes are only for her.

1542
01:33:05,840 --> 01:33:07,240
Can you go faster?

1543
01:33:07,360 --> 01:33:08,680
What if I just push him faster?

1544
01:33:09,840 --> 01:33:11,000
No, okay, I fucked up.

1545
01:33:11,340 --> 01:33:13,120
Pushing him faster makes him go even slower.

1546
01:33:14,260 --> 01:33:14,880
Where is it?

1547
01:33:14,980 --> 01:33:15,720
Is that the bar?

1548
01:33:16,300 --> 01:33:17,640
Okay, that's the bar over there.

1549
01:33:18,380 --> 01:33:18,880
It's open.

1550
01:33:23,480 --> 01:33:25,260
I want to get this over with it.

1551
01:33:25,260 --> 01:33:26,900
I can't get in front of the door.

1552
01:33:28,180 --> 01:33:30,700
Oh no, he tricked me into doing a loading screen, guys.

1553
01:33:31,360 --> 01:33:32,500
He fucking tricked me.

1554
01:33:34,340 --> 01:33:36,580
I literally can't open that...

1555
01:33:36,580 --> 01:33:37,420
Okay, there you go.

1556
01:33:42,140 --> 01:33:44,540
He tricked me to go to a loading screen.

1557
01:33:44,680 --> 01:33:45,960
Oh wait, there's more than one person here.

1558
01:33:46,920 --> 01:33:47,560
There's Nelson.

1559
01:33:48,060 --> 01:33:49,220
Jesus Paul.

1560
01:33:49,760 --> 01:33:50,460
What now?

1561
01:33:50,760 --> 01:33:53,460
It's time for you to shut up and listen, Cook.

1562
01:33:53,480 --> 01:34:00,860
what the hell is this and what are you doing here i'm here
to watch don't tell me he's hired you to help lean on me

1563
01:34:00,860 --> 01:34:12,480
that's right why do you care that's right i should listen to

Is that what you're saying?

1571
01:34:34,820 --> 01:34:35,300
Do it.

1572
01:34:41,570 --> 01:34:42,910
Give Cook a chance.

1573
01:34:43,170 --> 01:34:44,090
Attack Cook.

1574
01:34:46,170 --> 01:34:47,130
Calm down.

1575
01:34:48,050 --> 01:34:49,170

Do it.

1583
01:35:10,570 --> 01:35:11,690
Better just shoot him, Paul.

1584
01:35:12,170 --> 01:35:12,810
Heavens, no.

1585
01:35:13,110 --> 01:35:13,670

Hey, Paul.

1605
01:36:14,260 --> 01:36:15,360
Hell, I gotta get out of here.

1606
01:36:15,860 --> 01:36:18,560
You should, too, before someone walks in here and pins this
on us.

1607
01:36:20,100 --> 01:36:21,260
I'm gonna rob him.

1608
01:36:22,420 --> 01:36:22,780
Oh.

1609
01:36:23,060 --> 01:36:25,280
Cook Residence, shotgun, double shotgun.

1610
01:36:25,600 --> 01:36:25,980
Whoa.

1611
01:36:26,240 --> 01:36:27,360
I'm gonna take his suit, too.

1612
01:36:27,900 --> 01:36:28,740
That's a nice suit.

1613
01:36:29,020 --> 01:36:30,940
Wait, if he's dead, I can rob him.

1614
01:36:31,500 --> 01:36:32,960
Cogsworth isn't here anymore, right?

1615
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:36,560
Oh my god, wait, he's not here!

1616
01:36:39,880 --> 01:36:40,380
Over here!

1617
01:36:41,160 --> 01:36:41,360
What?

1618
01:36:48,060 --> 01:36:50,320
Wait, he cares?

1619
01:36:50,500 --> 01:36:51,180
Don't be late!

1620
01:36:52,040 --> 01:36:52,240
What?

1621
01:36:54,320 --> 01:36:56,620
Wait, you shot me?

1622
01:36:57,420 --> 01:36:59,560
Why did he shot me?

1623
01:36:59,720 --> 01:37:01,200
Shut up and listen, Cook.

1624
01:37:01,800 --> 01:37:02,640
What the hell is this?

1625
01:37:03,220 --> 01:37:05,060
Wait, did Paul shoot me?

1626
01:37:05,400 --> 01:37:08,700
Don't tell me he's hired you to help lean on me.

1627
01:37:09,680 --> 01:37:12,240
I can't believe it!

1628
01:37:14,380 --> 01:37:16,540
He betrayed me!

1629
01:37:17,620 --> 01:37:22,380
Stealing is where he draws the line.

1630
01:37:23,140 --> 01:37:25,060
I can't believe it.

1631
01:37:25,160 --> 01:37:25,640
Just this.

1632
01:37:26,260 --> 01:37:28,900
You leave Darcy alone starting now or else.

1633
01:37:29,240 --> 01:37:32,340
He draws the line at stealing.

1634
01:37:33,060 --> 01:37:35,500
You don't want to pull a gun on me unless you intend to use
it.

1635
01:37:35,560 --> 01:37:36,660
You think I won't use it?

1636
01:37:37,040 --> 01:37:38,180
Do I just need to kill you?

1637
01:37:38,280 --> 01:37:38,980
Is that what you're saying?

1638
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:50,320

motivated to hear what you have to say oh he never listens

fool around with darts paul he used to be one of my best

1642
01:38:26,420 --> 01:38:38,460
pals the timeline has changed i've been thinking about
making a break for a while now and well time to action past

1643
01:38:38,460 --> 01:38:52,000
time so i have an idea maybe we can help each other put this
all behind us you know what's the idea what's the idea

1644
01:38:52,000 --> 01:39:01,520
here's the deal i have some other um businesses on the side
one of them is helping nelson latimer spend his dad's money

1645
01:39:01,520 --> 01:39:07,600
to make himself feel like a gangster Who's Nelson?

1646
01:39:07,820 --> 01:39:09,100
Yeah, who's Nelson Latimer?

1647
01:39:09,960 --> 01:39:11,520
An arrogant little piss ant.

1648
01:39:12,320 --> 01:39:18,240
But useful since he has all the money in the world and likes
to think of himself as a budding crime boss.

1649
01:39:19,420 --> 01:39:26,700
Me and Nelson are supposed to be meeting some gentleman from
Good Neighbor to exchange Nelson's cash for their chems.

1650
01:39:27,500 --> 01:39:28,640
My plan is simple.

1651
01:39:29,280 --> 01:39:31,300
We take the money and the chems.

1652
01:39:34,140 --> 01:39:35,000
Wait, okay.

1653
01:39:35,460 --> 01:39:36,860
Am I just helping them off?

these guys over all of a sudden oh it isn't all of a sudden

1655
01:39:47,520 --> 01:39:56,260

may be thinking about trying to strike out on his own i've

1656
01:39:56,260 --> 01:40:05,240
been waiting for the right opportunity to present itself and
here it is anything else i might as well yeah that's it

1664
01:40:14,500 --> 01:40:16,580
I promise you won't regret it.

1665
01:40:16,880 --> 01:40:19,180
In a few hours, we're both going to be sitting.

1666
01:40:19,520 --> 01:40:20,120
Yeah, no, what?

1667

Thank God.

1668
01:40:21,580 --> 01:40:23,400

I'll get money, too.

1670
01:40:26,480 --> 01:40:27,900

Yeah, screw Paul in this timeline.

1677

I got free stuff.

1678
01:40:46,740 --> 01:40:49,300
Something bad went down in the old museum of witchcraft up
there.

1679
01:40:49,680 --> 01:40:50,640
Museum of witchcraft?

1680
01:40:50,880 --> 01:40:52,320
Why would anyone even go there?

1681
01:40:52,600 --> 01:40:53,460
I've been abandoned forever.

1682
01:40:53,520 --> 01:40:55,360
Yeah, Paul already paid me anyway.

1683
01:40:55,460 --> 01:40:56,640
Now I get more money.

Okay, we can...

I think we can sell majority of our clothes.

1707
01:42:48,240 --> 01:42:48,600
I...

1708
01:42:48,600 --> 01:42:51,500
Um, I admit that we don't need all of these clothes.

1709
01:42:51,960 --> 01:42:52,380
Like...

1710
01:42:53,580 --> 01:42:54,780
We don't...

1711
01:42:54,780 --> 01:42:56,800
We can always grab more suits.

1712
01:42:57,180 --> 01:42:59,660
Like, we can always grab more of these.

1713
01:43:00,260 --> 01:43:00,560
Alright.

1714
01:43:01,520 --> 01:43:02,120

Oh, is the letter better than the...

1716
01:43:04,380 --> 01:43:05,860
Is the letter better than the raider?

1717
01:43:06,020 --> 01:43:06,760
No, it's not.

1718
01:43:06,780 --> 01:43:08,940
so I can sell the leather ones.

1719
01:43:10,280 --> 01:43:11,820
Uh, but the trip.

1720
01:43:12,920 --> 01:43:14,660
Okay, I need all the aid and stuff.

1721

1726
01:43:23,700 --> 01:43:26,720
Okay, maybe not 512.

1727
01:43:27,420 --> 01:43:29,100
I'd sell like 200 of that.

1728
01:43:30,060 --> 01:43:30,360

Doctor says I can't drink liquor no more.

finally sit for real when you're trying to find someone

everything you can no matter how uh uh sean looking for my

1757
01:45:06,360 --> 01:45:09,980
baby Sean, he's less than a year old.

1758
01:45:11,640 --> 01:45:12,680
Why would anyone take him?

1759
01:45:12,980 --> 01:45:14,360
Wes, welcome to Jamia Farm.

1760
01:45:14,520 --> 01:45:15,060
Welcome, welcome.

1761
01:45:16,280 --> 01:45:17,300
Why an infant?

1762
01:45:17,860 --> 01:45:21,660
Someone would be taking on all of his care and a baby needs
a lot of it.

1763
01:45:22,160 --> 01:45:23,280
What else can you tell me?

1764
01:45:24,440 --> 01:45:28,460
Um, he killed my husband's not that important.

1765
01:45:28,860 --> 01:45:29,760
You were in a vault when it happened.

1766
01:45:31,400 --> 01:45:32,440
Vault 111.

1767
01:45:32,720 --> 01:45:35,560
It was some kind of cryo facility.

1768
01:45:35,740 --> 01:45:36,640
You were on ice.

1769
01:45:37,680 --> 01:45:45,440
more importantly you were underground sealed up it's a lot
of obstacles to get through just to take oh he's dead i

1770
01:45:45,440 --> 01:45:57,500
gotta move on my husband's dead my kidnappers there was a
man and a woman they didn't say much but but i remember they

1771
01:45:57,500 --> 01:46:05,860
they called me the backup so we're talking a small team
professionals the kind that know to keep their lips tight

1772
01:46:05,860 --> 01:46:10,760
when they're on the job I'm not sure what the backup means
though.

1773
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:12,900
Cogsbury, what are you doing?

1774
01:46:13,120 --> 01:46:14,640
This isn't a random kidnapping.

1775
01:46:15,520 --> 01:46:17,660
Whoever took your kid had an agenda.

1776
01:46:18,900 --> 01:46:22,020
There's a lot of groups in the Commonwealth that take
people.

1777
01:46:22,660 --> 01:46:23,060
Raiders.

1778
01:46:23,760 --> 01:46:24,460
Super mutants.

1779
01:46:24,760 --> 01:46:25,320
The gunners.

1780
01:46:26,140 --> 01:46:27,840
And of course there's the Institute.

1781
01:46:28,680 --> 01:46:29,420
The Institute?

1782
01:46:30,100 --> 01:46:33,660
So you think this Institute is responsible?

1783
01:46:33,880 --> 01:46:35,920
Well, they're the boogeymen of the Commonwealth.

1784
01:46:36,780 --> 01:46:45,220
goes wrong everyone blames them easy to see why those early
models sense of theirs strip whole towns for parts killing

1785
01:46:45,220 --> 01:46:51,840
everything in their way wait i want to join the institute
good as human but infiltrate cities and pull strings from

1786
01:46:51,840 --> 01:46:59,880
the shadows worst of all no one knows why they do it what
their plan is or where they are not even it sounds strong

1787
01:46:59,880 --> 01:47:01,180
i'm a synth myself

1788
01:47:06,780 --> 01:47:14,480
of them you're a prototype you're a prototype as far as i
know never seen any other synth like myself there's the

1789
01:47:14,480 --> 01:47:21,980
older ones that are dumb as rocks and all metal and there's
the newer ones that are almost human i'm somewhere in

1790
01:47:21,980 --> 01:47:31,300
between yeah like you're really you can tell you're really
really old don't lie to me nick you're one of them they made

1791
01:47:31,300 --> 01:47:34,600
you yeah i've heard it all before You're a freak.

1792
01:47:35,100 --> 01:47:36,500
You've got something to hide.

1793
01:47:36,600 --> 01:47:37,080
Yeah, freak.

1794
01:47:38,820 --> 01:47:40,700
Wait, aren't you programmed to support the Institute?

1795
01:47:41,220 --> 01:47:46,200
People smart enough to build something like me are smart
enough to cover their tracks and arrogant enough to throw

1796
01:47:46,200 --> 01:47:50,640
their unwanted trash into the Commonwealth to fend for
itself.

1797
01:47:52,480 --> 01:47:54,820
Either way, I need to find Sean.

1798
01:47:54,980 --> 01:47:55,380
You're right.

1799
01:47:55,980 --> 01:47:57,960
Don't be mean to Nick.

1800
01:47:59,260 --> 01:48:01,880
What did these kidnappers look like?

1801
01:48:03,400 --> 01:48:20,840
broke his programming they carried a gun that eliminates
like one person I'll never forget that voice low and rough

1802
01:48:20,840 --> 01:48:30,600
like that's like everybody in the wasteland cross your face
not much to go on but a tough and commanding voice can get

1803
01:48:30,600 --> 01:48:40,420
someone pretty far in the violence business what else um he
was bald one of them came right up to me he had no hair just

1804
01:48:40,420 --> 01:48:53,010

at all did you like the serial who is he do you think he has

1805
01:48:53,010 --> 01:48:58,790
sean he named himself after the serial because he saw a
serial box ellie what notes do we have about the kellogg

1806
01:48:58,790 --> 01:49:07,990
case the description matches bald head scar reputation for
dangerous employer is and he bought a house here in town

1807
01:49:07,990 --> 01:49:14,870

the house in the abandoned wet stands the boy with him was

1808
01:49:14,870 --> 01:49:15,810

1809
01:49:19,250 --> 01:49:28,270
it's sean it's sean it has to be 10 now somehow don't jump
the gun on me you said you were looking if it's another kid

1810
01:49:28,270 --> 01:49:35,630
it has to be sean there's no no other children in this world
look maybe he has kid.

1811
01:49:36,450 --> 01:49:39,050
Either way, they both vanished a while back.

1812
01:49:39,410 --> 01:49:40,450
Who else could it be?

1813
01:49:40,690 --> 01:49:42,170
There's no other children here.

1814
01:49:43,090 --> 01:49:45,850
See if we can snoop out where he went.

1815
01:49:46,370 --> 01:49:50,210
Security doesn't really go to that part of town, but you two
should still be careful.

1816
01:49:50,270 --> 01:49:52,290
How do I make him join my team, guys?

1817
01:49:53,930 --> 01:49:55,510
Nick, join my team.

1818
01:49:56,350 --> 01:49:57,770
Nick, I don't care about Cox.

1819
01:49:57,910 --> 01:49:58,410
Join my team.

1820
01:49:58,690 --> 01:49:58,690

Nick.

1822
01:49:59,810 --> 01:50:00,290
Come on.

1823
01:50:00,870 --> 01:50:02,730
No, join my team, Nick.

1824
01:50:03,330 --> 01:50:03,730
No!

1825
01:50:09,390 --> 01:50:12,130
I can't open the door, Nick!

1826
01:50:16,690 --> 01:50:17,690
Oh, I finished the quest?

1827
01:50:17,830 --> 01:50:22,150
Okay, I want Nick to join my team and replace Cogsworth.

1828
01:50:23,290 --> 01:50:24,790
You talk to a kid when you're...

1829
01:50:24,790 --> 01:50:25,690
She doesn't count.

1830
01:50:29,390 --> 01:50:30,910
She's not a kid.

1831
01:50:38,050 --> 01:50:38,630
Please...

1832
01:50:38,730 --> 01:50:42,190
Why doesn't it take forever to load back?

1833
01:50:42,290 --> 01:50:43,070
Oh, there we go.

1834
01:50:43,250 --> 01:50:45,050
Okay, I jumped a gun there.

1835
01:50:45,650 --> 01:50:46,510
All right, where do we have to go?

1836
01:50:49,630 --> 01:50:50,570
Where do we go?

1837
01:50:50,610 --> 01:50:53,330
I don't want Ellie to hear this, but I think you should
know.

1838
01:50:54,070 --> 01:50:58,860
Everything I dug up about bad news.

1839
01:50:58,940 --> 01:50:59,840
What do you mean by that?

1840
01:50:59,980 --> 01:51:01,240
More than just a mercenary.

1841
01:51:01,760 --> 01:51:02,880
He's a professional.

1842
01:51:03,320 --> 01:51:05,720
Quick, clean, thorough.

1843
01:51:06,560 --> 01:51:07,700
Has no enemies.

1844
01:51:08,220 --> 01:51:09,360
Because they're all dead.

1845
01:51:09,660 --> 01:51:10,820
Oh, that's scary.

1846
01:51:11,760 --> 01:51:20,300
nine to one odds says he's our man more than just you

Okay, where's the objective of this quest?

1851
01:51:50,580 --> 01:51:52,060
It doesn't even tell me.

1852
01:51:55,240 --> 01:51:56,260
Are you done talking?

1853
01:51:56,620 --> 01:51:58,040
Like, can you go a little faster?

1854
01:52:01,420 --> 01:52:02,960
Please, why can't you run?

1855
01:52:03,040 --> 01:52:04,340
That's all I ask of you.

1856
01:52:05,140 --> 01:52:05,680
This is it?

1857
01:52:05,780 --> 01:52:06,340
Here we are.

1858
01:52:06,860 --> 01:52:07,780
Keep an eye out, will you?

1859
01:52:08,340 --> 01:52:09,800
See if I can get this open.

1860
01:52:11,440 --> 01:52:12,400
Oh my god, he's perfect.

1861
01:52:12,560 --> 01:52:13,300
He can unlock doors.

1862
01:52:13,420 --> 01:52:14,200
What can you do?

1863
01:52:14,900 --> 01:52:16,720
What can, exactly, walk away.

1864
01:52:20,080 --> 01:52:22,480
Wait, you can't unlock this?

1865
01:52:23,040 --> 01:52:23,800
Oh my god.

1866
01:52:24,920 --> 01:52:26,320
I can't do it.

1867
01:52:26,400 --> 01:52:28,060
I'm not smart enough.

1868
01:52:29,360 --> 01:52:31,080
We need to find a key.

1869
01:52:34,140 --> 01:52:36,100
See that platform in the distance?

1870
01:52:36,400 --> 01:52:37,360
Near the city entrance?

1871
01:52:37,580 --> 01:52:37,900
Where?

1872
01:52:38,060 --> 01:52:40,240
That's the elevator to the mayor's office.

1873
01:52:41,440 --> 01:52:50,700

1876
01:53:21,350 --> 01:53:22,110
Goodbye, Cosworth.

1877
01:53:22,310 --> 01:53:23,330
You're fucking useless.

1878
01:53:23,850 --> 01:53:26,810
I can't wait to replace you with a better fucking robot.

1879
01:53:28,910 --> 01:53:30,430
You're not even hot.

1880
01:53:32,670 --> 01:53:34,490
That used you for eye candy.

1881
01:53:37,710 --> 01:53:39,110
Wow, rude.

1882
01:53:39,790 --> 01:53:40,050
What?

1883
01:53:40,110 --> 01:53:41,410
You think Cosworth's hot?

1884
01:53:41,790 --> 01:53:41,970
Huh?

1885
01:53:42,310 --> 01:53:43,370
He's afraid of talking to the police.

1886
01:53:43,390 --> 01:53:46,270
I bet if I said I was with the Institute, he'd come running.

1887
01:53:46,570 --> 01:53:50,190
Do you ever think maybe you could get a man's attention
easier if you use soft.

1888
01:53:50,390 --> 01:53:50,830
Whoa.

1889
01:53:51,870 --> 01:53:53,250
And shout a little less.

1890
01:53:53,270 --> 01:53:54,990
Oh my god, she doesn't need no man.

1891
01:53:55,190 --> 01:53:56,050
She needs a woman.

1892
01:53:56,750 --> 01:53:58,690
Hey, girl.

1893
01:54:00,950 --> 01:54:02,630
She needs a woman.

You first.

1895
01:54:08,110 --> 01:54:09,530

1957
01:59:52,380 --> 01:59:55,700
If you have to face Kellogg on your own, just say so.

02:06:50,600 --> 02:06:50,960
Oh!

2072
02:06:52,740 --> 02:06:53,740
Bad boy!

2073
02:06:55,800 --> 02:06:56,800
Holy shit.

2074
02:06:57,800 --> 02:06:59,220
Oh, my God.

2075
02:07:00,180 --> 02:07:01,520
Oh, my God.

2076
02:07:01,800 --> 02:07:03,040
This is why I got you, Nick.

2077
02:07:03,800 --> 02:07:04,240
Bam!

2078
02:07:05,820 --> 02:07:05,960
Oh!

2079
02:07:06,440 --> 02:07:07,880
Did you see that dog fight?

2080
02:07:08,840 --> 02:07:11,800
Bro, my dog, this is the legal type of dog fighting.

2081
02:07:14,020 --> 02:07:15,640
Because those are evil dogs.

2082
02:07:16,040 --> 02:07:17,120
Wait, we did it at dog meat.

2083
02:07:18,060 --> 02:07:18,940
Wait, where's dog meat?

2084
02:07:19,080 --> 02:07:19,800
Where did he go?

2085
02:07:21,780 --> 02:07:23,460
Where did dog meat go?

2086
02:07:23,540 --> 02:07:25,900
Wait, actually, where the fuck did my dog go?

2087
02:07:30,040 --> 02:07:31,540
Guys, I lost my dog.

2088
02:07:34,380 --> 02:07:34,820
Guys.

2089
02:07:35,440 --> 02:07:36,900
I lost him.

2090
02:07:38,040 --> 02:07:38,820
My dog's gone.

2091
02:07:43,780 --> 02:07:44,900
Their evil dies.

2092
02:07:45,160 --> 02:07:46,980
We just literally saw two dogs fighting.

2093
02:07:51,230 --> 02:07:52,370
Wait, where's dog meat?

2094
02:07:54,430 --> 02:07:55,130
Dog meat?

2095
02:07:57,110 --> 02:07:58,670
Where did dog meat go?

2096
02:08:03,080 --> 02:08:04,500
I need to turn on the quest.

2097
02:08:04,680 --> 02:08:05,320
I might as well.

2098
02:08:05,660 --> 02:08:06,160
Reunions.

2099
02:08:06,320 --> 02:08:07,200
Follow dog meat.

2100
02:08:07,280 --> 02:08:07,900
Where did he go?

2101
02:08:08,460 --> 02:08:09,680
Oh, he went this way.

2102
02:08:10,160 --> 02:08:10,600
Is that it?

2103
02:08:10,660 --> 02:08:11,580
Is that the real quest?

2104
02:08:12,540 --> 02:08:12,940
No.

2105
02:08:13,560 --> 02:08:14,420
This is a quest.

2106
02:08:16,940 --> 02:08:17,880
He's over here.

2107
02:08:18,920 --> 02:08:19,900
Oh, he's barking at me.

2108
02:08:20,200 --> 02:08:21,320
He's calling me stupid.

2109
02:08:21,920 --> 02:08:22,760
Bro, dog meat.

2110
02:08:22,920 --> 02:08:23,640
Wear a vest.

2111
02:08:24,060 --> 02:08:26,680
We need to wear a reflected vest, dog meat.

2112
02:08:26,840 --> 02:08:28,340
I can barely see where you are.

2113
02:08:29,860 --> 02:08:30,800
I'm gonna loot that.

2114
02:08:37,300 --> 02:08:38,220
I'm not dog meat.

2115
02:08:38,440 --> 02:08:39,020
Where are they?

2116
02:08:39,260 --> 02:08:39,960
Where's Kellogg?

2117
02:08:40,440 --> 02:08:41,020
The cereal.

2118
02:08:43,180 --> 02:08:43,480
Oh, my God.

2119
02:08:43,540 --> 02:08:43,940
That's a bear.

2120
02:08:44,220 --> 02:08:44,620
That's a bear.

2121
02:08:44,840 --> 02:08:46,060
That's a fucking bear.

2122
02:08:46,960 --> 02:08:47,500
Why?

2123
02:08:48,260 --> 02:08:50,000
I can't fucking fight a bear.

2124
02:08:50,060 --> 02:08:50,840
I'm gonna fight a bear.

2125
02:08:51,320 --> 02:08:52,720
I'm gonna fight a bear.

2126
02:08:53,260 --> 02:08:58,860
Oh, that is not the Oh, okay, but what?

2127
02:08:59,840 --> 02:09:02,120
Oh, how much damage do I do?

2128
02:09:02,820 --> 02:09:03,240
I do.

2129
02:09:03,940 --> 02:09:05,560
Oh, that was a mistake.

2130
02:09:05,860 --> 02:09:06,840
That was a mistake.

2131
02:09:12,260 --> 02:09:15,900
Guys, guys, guys, I don't

2132
02:09:28,010 --> 02:09:30,230
It's not just a bear.

2133
02:09:30,710 --> 02:09:33,390
Guys, it was not just a bear.

2134
02:09:33,970 --> 02:09:35,750
Guys, guys, it was...

2135
02:09:35,750 --> 02:09:40,070
Oh my god.

2136
02:09:40,470 --> 02:09:42,690
I had to fight the dogs again?

2137
02:09:43,550 --> 02:09:44,450
Alright, guys.

2138
02:09:44,750 --> 02:09:45,970
It was not just a bear.

2139
02:09:46,070 --> 02:09:46,990
I've learned...

2140
02:09:46,990 --> 02:09:53,110
I've learned that it was absolutely much worse than just a
bear.

2141
02:09:53,750 --> 02:09:54,190
Alright.

2142
02:09:56,190 --> 02:10:11,600
it was it was a radioactive bear i can't believe i didn't
save i can't believe we're gonna kill a bear today it's okay

2143
02:10:11,600 --> 02:10:14,740
low 7 the low 15 zone what like it's hard

2144
02:10:18,340 --> 02:10:25,340
we can do this i believe in us can't be that difficult

2145
02:10:29,940 --> 02:10:30,740
Bloody bandages.

2146
02:10:30,980 --> 02:10:31,600
Find him.

2147
02:10:31,640 --> 02:10:32,940
Dog meat can track this.

2148
02:10:33,340 --> 02:10:35,000
That nose is second to none.

2149
02:10:35,900 --> 02:10:36,880
What do you think, boy?

2150
02:10:37,320 --> 02:10:38,060
Enough to go on?

2151
02:10:39,120 --> 02:10:40,420
We'll be fine, right?

2152
02:10:40,460 --> 02:10:41,000
We'll be fine.

2153
02:10:41,160 --> 02:10:41,740
We'll be so fine.

2154
02:10:41,920 --> 02:10:42,740
We're going to be so healthy.

2155
02:10:43,500 --> 02:10:45,080
All right, we're going to grab...

2156
02:10:45,080 --> 02:10:45,420
Let's see.

2157
02:10:45,540 --> 02:10:46,500
A comfort grip.

2158
02:10:47,840 --> 02:10:50,200
Ooh, this is a better pistol, actually.

2159
02:10:50,820 --> 02:10:51,360
And then...

2160
02:10:51,360 --> 02:10:52,420
Oh, I should grab a shotgun.

2161
02:10:52,780 --> 02:10:53,020
Never mind.

2162
02:10:53,080 --> 02:10:53,800
I'm grabbing a shotgun.

2163
02:10:54,180 --> 02:10:55,620
We're going to be fucking shooting bears.

2164
02:10:55,780 --> 02:10:56,920
We're going to grab...

2165
02:10:59,290 --> 02:11:00,010
What the...

2166
02:11:00,090 --> 02:11:00,370
What the fuck?

2167
02:11:00,990 --> 02:11:02,730
Alright, just fucking grab a pistol.

2168
02:11:03,990 --> 02:11:05,750
These guys take so long.

2169
02:11:09,410 --> 02:11:10,270
Bro, what the fuck?

2170
02:11:10,390 --> 02:11:11,890
It was easier to just...

2171
02:11:11,890 --> 02:11:12,310
Whoa!

2172
02:11:12,790 --> 02:11:14,170
Okay, I'm fucking grabbing a...

2173
02:11:14,170 --> 02:11:16,450
The shotgun sucks!

2174
02:11:17,070 --> 02:11:19,430
The shotgun fucking sucks!

2175
02:11:19,730 --> 02:11:20,750
What the hell?

2176
02:11:21,070 --> 02:11:21,830
Look at this pistol.

2177
02:11:22,910 --> 02:11:23,550
Watch this pistol.

2178
02:11:25,510 --> 02:11:27,350
Oh my god, the pistol is faster.

2179
02:11:27,690 --> 02:11:28,090
Look, see?

2180
02:11:28,890 --> 02:11:29,810
Wait, no.

2181
02:11:30,090 --> 02:11:32,550
Yeah, the pistol is so much faster.

2182
02:11:33,310 --> 02:11:34,730
Get you some dog meat.

2183
02:11:38,410 --> 02:11:38,850
Alright, guys.

2184
02:11:38,970 --> 02:11:39,930
I gotta figure this out.

2185
02:11:41,050 --> 02:11:43,610
I gotta figure this out what gun to use.

2186
02:11:43,710 --> 02:11:45,350
Because all these guns fucking suck.

2187
02:11:47,250 --> 02:11:48,750
The auto pistol.

2188
02:11:51,650 --> 02:11:52,470
Let's see.

2189
02:11:54,750 --> 02:11:55,870
I don't know.

2190
02:11:56,110 --> 02:11:58,190
What's the best gun to fight the...

2191
02:11:58,190 --> 02:11:59,210
The mini gun?

2192
02:12:00,090 --> 02:12:01,390
To fight the bear?

2193
02:12:07,790 --> 02:12:08,770
Okay, maybe...

2194
02:12:09,310 --> 02:12:10,090
This gun.

2195
02:12:10,670 --> 02:12:11,770
This gun would be okay.

2196
02:12:13,430 --> 02:12:14,610
Alright, we're gonna save.

2197
02:12:15,390 --> 02:12:16,250
We're gonna save.

2198
02:12:19,710 --> 02:12:20,270
Alright.

2199
02:12:23,050 --> 02:12:24,790
We're gonna see a bear soon.

2200
02:12:31,740 --> 02:12:33,560
Alright, it's bear time.

2201
02:12:35,700 --> 02:12:37,440
Oh, that's the worst gun I could use?

2202
02:12:37,600 --> 02:12:37,880
Okay.

2203
02:12:38,380 --> 02:12:38,940
Okay.

2204
02:12:40,540 --> 02:12:42,100
Okay, all right.

2205
02:12:44,040 --> 02:12:48,520
Okay, maybe we can do something with this gun, right?

2206
02:12:49,500 --> 02:12:50,140
Where's the bear?

2207
02:12:50,240 --> 02:12:50,860
Is he here?

2208
02:12:51,040 --> 02:12:52,080
Is he here again?

2209
02:12:52,680 --> 02:12:53,860
Is the bear back?

2210
02:12:54,700 --> 02:12:56,120
Wait, was that just...

2211
02:12:56,120 --> 02:12:57,080
Oh, wait, there he is.

2212
02:13:00,360 --> 02:13:01,040
Oh, God.

2213
02:13:01,260 --> 02:13:01,740
Oh, God.

2214
02:13:02,100 --> 02:13:02,620
Oh, God.

2215
02:13:03,620 --> 02:13:04,220
Oh, God.

2216
02:13:04,420 --> 02:13:04,700
Hit it.

2217
02:13:04,700 --> 02:13:05,040
Hit it.

2218
02:13:05,040 --> 02:13:05,520
Hit it.

2219
02:13:05,520 --> 02:13:05,840
No.

2220
02:13:06,560 --> 02:13:07,180
Give me the crit.

2221
02:13:07,280 --> 02:13:07,860
Give me the crit.

2222
02:13:08,700 --> 02:13:08,860
Is

2223
02:13:15,130 --> 02:13:15,810
that...

2224
02:13:16,410 --> 02:13:17,750
Oh god, Nick, shoot him!

2225
02:13:17,930 --> 02:13:19,770
Nick, shoot him for the love of God!

2226
02:13:19,930 --> 02:13:20,790
Shoot the bear!

2227
02:13:24,490 --> 02:13:25,410
Oh god.

2228
02:13:28,070 --> 02:13:29,330
Sacrifice yourself!

2229
02:13:32,250 --> 02:13:34,610
Nick, sacrifice yourself for me!

2230
02:13:35,470 --> 02:13:35,730
Oh!

2231
02:13:36,070 --> 02:13:37,290
Sacrifice yourself!

2232
02:13:40,130 --> 02:13:42,790
Don't be regen HP right now!

2233
02:13:44,050 --> 02:13:45,570
Oh, I ran out of ammo.

2234
02:13:46,410 --> 02:13:48,690
I ran out of ammo.

2235
02:13:51,170 --> 02:13:54,410
Oh, what gun has ammo right now?

2236
02:13:59,700 --> 02:14:02,060
Oh my god, I fucking knew you would be killed!

2237
02:14:02,960 --> 02:14:03,140
No!

2238
02:14:08,280 --> 02:14:09,340
Holy shit.

2239
02:14:09,820 --> 02:14:12,000
Please, please, please, please, please, please, please.

2240
02:14:13,940 --> 02:14:15,060
Holy shit.

2241

Oh my god, please, God, please, God, please.

2243
02:14:22,080 --> 02:14:22,580
Wait, wait, wait.

2244
02:14:23,080 --> 02:14:23,640
I'm trying.

2245
02:14:23,960 --> 02:14:24,980
Oh, the Dragon Buster.

2246
02:14:25,660 --> 02:14:26,640
The Dragon Buster.

2247
02:14:30,850 --> 02:14:31,790
Oh, God.

2248
02:14:32,150 --> 02:14:32,510
Reload.

2249
02:14:32,630 --> 02:14:33,130
Reload.

2250
02:14:33,770 --> 02:14:33,770

Nick.

2255
02:14:37,950 --> 02:14:38,550
Take this.

2256

This is where we're calling today.

2315
02:19:11,030 --> 02:19:13,170
This is where we're calling it today.

2316
02:19:13,730 --> 02:19:18,670
I think that was the point where I was like, my mind's not
working anymore.

2317
02:19:22,850 --> 02:19:26,270
You guys were like, oh, you can disarm it.

2318
02:19:26,390 --> 02:19:28,690
Use your vets and you can disarm it.

2319
02:19:28,930 --> 02:19:33,630
But I think somebody meant like, use your vets to find like
mines.

2320
02:19:33,810 --> 02:19:36,550
But then I thought like, oh, use my vets to disarm it.

2321
02:19:38,150 --> 02:19:43,210
but then I realized, oh, they meant, like, if you can't,
don't know where the mines are, you can use your vats.

2322
02:19:43,630 --> 02:19:45,090
But I didn't read the last part.

2323
02:19:45,210 --> 02:19:47,910
I read the beginning where someone said, use vats.

2324
02:19:48,350 --> 02:19:51,110
And then I didn't read the end of the sentence.

2325
02:19:54,970 --> 02:19:56,150
All right, thank you for the super chat.

2326
02:19:56,230 --> 02:19:56,930
Thank you, thank you.

02:19:56,930 --> 02:19:58,530
You know, Piper is a good companion to you.

2328
02:19:58,590 --> 02:19:59,710
She has a face and legs.

2329
02:19:59,790 --> 02:20:00,410
Thank you for the super chat.

02:20:00,450 --> 02:20:00,830
Thank you, thank you.

2331
02:20:00,970 --> 02:20:02,550
But she's not a hot robot.

2332
02:20:02,910 --> 02:20:04,990
That's the only thing, guys.

2333
02:20:04,990 --> 02:20:07,470
That's the only thing that, like, is the deal-breaker.

2334
02:20:11,870 --> 02:20:12,510
Oh, my God.

2335
02:20:13,990 --> 02:20:17,950
