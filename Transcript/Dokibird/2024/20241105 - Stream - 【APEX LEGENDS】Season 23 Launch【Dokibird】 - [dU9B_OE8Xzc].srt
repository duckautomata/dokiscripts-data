00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:42,880
Hello, everybody!

2
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:44,460
Hello, hello!

3
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:50,700
Sorry, I'm... I literally got home from my dance classes, like, um, 30 minutes ago.

4
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:54,380
I haven't... I didn't want to eat before my dance classes, so...

5
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:58,460
I had to, like... I had to walk dad, and then I had to...

6
00:03:58,460 --> 00:03:59,900
Oh my God, MasterDrop!

7
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,640
Thank you for the 50 gifted shits!

8
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:02,900
Thank you, thank you!

9
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,920
I really appreciate it, thank you so much!

10
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:09,640
Oh my God, we got some fresh tomatoes, dragoons!

11
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,100
Are you guys hungry?

12
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:16,220
Anyway, um, it's not cheat week this time.

13
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:17,640
It's not cheat day this time.

14
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:22,300
I got my grandma bread, and I used a... I got my brie cheese spread.

15
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,260
I put some chicken on it, and then I was like...

16
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:27,760
I was scared there was gonna be mold on it, because I was like...

17
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:32,820
It was in the fridge, and I was like, Google, how long can bread be in fridges?

18
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,360
And they're like, 14 days.

19
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,360
I was like, has it been 14 days yet?

20
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:38,620
So I checked for mold.

21
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:40,420
I made sure to check for mold.

22
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:47,780
I was a little concerned, but I made sure there was no mold growing on my bread.

23
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:49,740
And there wasn't.

24
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:51,960
So I was like, all right, it can't be that bad.

25
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:55,160
Like, if I don't see the mold, it's okay.

26
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,100
I made sure.

27
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,540
At least I checked.

28
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:04,020
I remember in university, I...

29
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:06,300
Because like, I was a very sheltered child.

30
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:09,720
So like, I didn't understand the concept of mold.

31
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,700
Like, I'm not joking.

32
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:15,060
I didn't realize mold existed when I went to university.

33
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:20,640
Because I didn't realize it can grow on bread.

34
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,040
So like, so I put my bread...

35
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:27,040
So like, I had a point where I was like, all right, I'm gonna go on a bread diet.

36
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:29,500
I'll just eat bread and hummus dip.

37
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,440
So I was like, obviously that wasn't healthy, but I was in university.

38
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,320
So I was just like...

39
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,220
I was like, we were doing a lot of unhealthy stuff in university.

40
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:45,620
So I was like, I was very sheltered.

41
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,120
No, I was a very sheltered child.

42
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:50,120
So I didn't really understand like, mold can grow on things.

43
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:52,340
Because like, you know, my parents would be like, eat this.

44
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,060
I'm like, I didn't understand anything.

45
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,300
So I was like, all right, I'm gonna...

46
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:59,460
And then like, you know, it was room temperature.

47
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:05,000
And you know, bread's supposed to be up room temperature maximum four days.

48
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,260
I didn't put it in the fridge because I had like, a mini fridge.

49
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:08,520
It didn't fit in the mini fridge.

50
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:10,820
So I was like, I'm just gonna put it out room temperature.

51
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,980
And like, obviously, I was just eating bread every day.

52
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,800
Like, just bread and hummus every day.

53
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:19,520
And then I noticed, what is these things growing on my bread?

54
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,220
I was like, I'll just rip it all out.

55
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,300
And then he...

56
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:30,780
And then after, I was like, wait, I don't think bread is supposed to do that.

57
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:36,820
I was like, wait a minute.

58
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:39,920
I don't think bread is supposed to do that.

59
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,100
So, you know, it kept getting more.

60
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:47,640
And I was like, oh, maybe...

61
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:51,340
And I like, I was like, wait, is this what mold is?

62
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:52,810
Is this like...

63
00:06:56,460 --> 00:07:02,700
And so that's when I discovered, I discovered what mold was.

64
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,920
So yeah, I checked the grandma bread.

65
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:08,100
And I was like, all right, the grandma bread has no mold growing.

66
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:09,820
I put it on the fridge.

67
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,140
And like, everything is fine.

68
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:13,700
So I cut it.

69
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,540
And I was like, I cut it with my bread knife.

70
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:17,660
And I was like, no, nothing's wrong.

71
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,000
I guess I can eat the soap.

72
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:19,660
I don't know.

73
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:24,840
If later today, if later today my stomach does not feel well, then maybe the mold is like...

74
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:31,260
Maybe I did not check as well as I thought I did.

75
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:32,660
So we'll see.

76
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:33,980
We'll see how it goes.

77
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:42,510
So yeah, also another update regarding the shower curtains.

78
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:46,050
I didn't realize that...

79
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:47,690
Yeah, I checked every length, by the way.

80
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:48,970
I checked everything.

81
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:50,230
It's not like in...

82
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:51,550
Like, I didn't put it at room temperature.

83
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:52,470
I put it in my fridge.

84
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:57,810
But anyway, I don't remember how long this bread has been in the fridge, but it seems okay.

85
00:07:58,170 --> 00:08:01,090
Anyway, update regarding the shower curtains.

86
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:07,390
I didn't realize that like, height-wise was a thing.

87
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:15,010
I thought shower curtains were universal regarding like, the height of a shower curtain.

88
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:21,110
So like, obviously, I hung the shower curtains, but like, it just...

89
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:27,710
Let's just say it doesn't go all the way down.

90
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:32,050
But it still works!

91
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:41,570
It's like, it's like, you know, it's like a just fit scenario, but like, it works, I think.

92
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:48,790
I mean, I took a shower, and like, I don't think any of the water came out.

93
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:55,390
So like, I think it's working, but I think I have to like, test it out a bit more to see if it...

94
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:56,310
And see if the...

95
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:58,050
Like, you know, if see it is 100%.

96
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:01,730
Like, I don't know if the water could slip through the cracks of it.

97
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:04,090
Like, it just, it just sort of fits.

98
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:10,450
Because like, it's a bathtub shower.

99
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:13,090
So like, it just touches the tub.

100
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:15,850
Just like, it just touches the tub.

101
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:19,890
So I was like, oh, I don't know.

102
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:24,130
I'm just like, wait, shower...

103
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:28,830
I thought, I thought the shower curtain is like, universal.

104
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:31,450
I didn't realize it's like, a specific height.

105
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:35,390
It looked really long.

106
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:37,410
I was like, it looks really long.

107
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:41,810
I thought, I thought it would go down a little bit more.

108
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:47,350
It's sort of working.

109
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:50,370
Also, Mike, thank you for the magenta soup.

110
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:51,910
Ah, thank you, thank you.

111
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:53,670
Hi, Doki, today is my birthday.

112
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:55,850
Just wanted to say thanks for always making us smile.

113
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:57,590
Thank you for the magenta soup, Mike.

114
00:09:58,010 --> 00:09:59,270
Happy birthday to you.

115
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:00,790
Happy birthday to you.

116
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:02,490
Happy birthday, dear Mike.

117
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:03,890
Happy birthday to you.

118
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:04,250
Yeah!

119
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:06,250
Happy birthday!

120
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:07,010
Yay!

121
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:10,750
Anyway, I have a lot of other life updates.

122
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:13,130
But like, those are like, my top two.

123
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:14,550
Anyway, just got back from dance lessons.

124
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:15,430
It's gonna be...

125
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:17,350
Oh my god, I was, I was so fucking tired.

126
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:21,370
I was like, I was like, I was so dead inside for the dance lessons.

127
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:22,490
It's a lot of dancing.

128
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:24,710
Like, I was like, I can do this.

129
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:27,930
I can, I can, I can do this, Doki.

130
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:34,210
You can, you can do dance lessons almost every day before, before you gotta do the 3D.

131
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:35,110
It's alright.

132
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:37,710
And now I'm like, maybe it's not alright.

133
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:46,590
Maybe, maybe, maybe it was a mistake trying to do dance lessons every day.

134
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:51,050
I was like, and I was like, can you do 10 AM?

135
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:53,410
And I was like, I can totally do 10 AM.

136
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:55,050
That's, that's good.

137
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:56,910
I can totally do 10 AM.

138
00:10:57,050 --> 00:10:58,910
And now I'm like, oh, maybe.

139
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:02,990
Why did I, why did I pick 10 in the morning?

140
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:08,950
It's like when you're doing university classes, and you're like, I could totally do morning classes in university.

141
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:14,990
I can, I can, I can definitely do morning classes in university.

142
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:22,230
And then, you know, you sign up for the morning classes, and you're like, oh, why did I pick, wait, wait a minute.

143
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:24,710
Also, I need to take off my contact lenses.

144
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:25,710
Give me a sec, guys.

145
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:28,070
I need, I need to take them off real quick.

146
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:32,310
Oh my god, I don't like playing video games with my contact lenses on.

147
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:34,850
I need to, like, buy new glasses, too.

148
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:38,790
Because, like, my new, my old pair has, is like, like, the degrees are okay.

149
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:47,330
But, like, um, but, like, uh, I just feel like, uh, the lens, I haven't bought new glasses in a long time.

150
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:52,310
And, oh my god, it's so hard to adjust back to the degree again when you have your glasses on.

151
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:55,930
Um, I buy Lindbergh glasses.

152
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:56,810
I don't know.

153
00:11:56,930 --> 00:11:59,430
It's just, like, my parents always bought me Lindbergh.

154
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:02,050
They're very, I know, they're very, they're a very expensive brand.

155
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:04,930
They're, like, one of the lightest glasses out there.

156
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:12,710
But, like, I'm so used to, I'm so used to wearing them that it feels weird if I wear, like, heavier glasses.

157
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:19,630
Um, anyway, um, but yeah, I had, oh my gosh.

158
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:27,690
I, I, god, it's just, um, that, oh my god, it's just, oh, the dance lessons, the morning dance lessons.

159
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:33,130
I even asked, like, can I, can I, like, uh, leave class 30 minutes early?

160
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:38,670
I was, like, I was, like, can I leave class 30 minutes early, please?

161
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:43,570
I, I don't, I don't, I don't want to do two hours.

162
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:45,650
I'm, I'm so over it.

163
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:47,270
I'm, I'm done.

164
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:49,970
I'm so done.

165
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:51,610
And they're, like, yeah, you can.

166
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:54,450
I was, like, I have a busy day today.

167
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:58,390
Also, I checked out the new Death Note game.

168
00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:00,510
Oh my god, it's so complicated.

169
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:12,790
By the way, um, uh, um, it's basically, like, it is Among Us, but, like, it's much more complicated than normal Among Us.

170
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:15,530
There's, like, there's, like, you can talk to Kira.

171
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:19,390
So, like, you can hand, you can basically swap Kiras.

172
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:26,930
So you can, like, give the Death Notes to other, uh, other Kira followers, and then you can swap Kiras, basically.

173
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:39,410
And, like, so, like, if they say, oh, I think you're Kira, but if you gave your Death Note to somebody else, then, um, and you, they nominate you as a suspect, you don't, you, you basically are safe.

174
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:42,690
So, like, they can basically swap the Death Notes everywhere and stuff.

175
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:47,290
And then, like, and then, oh my, it's so, it's actually really complicated.

176
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:49,170
And there's, like, in-game voice chat, too.

177
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:50,810
So you can talk to people in-game.

178
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:58,690
But, like, the funny thing is that in the settings, it doesn't tell you what button is the in-game voice chat.

179
00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:03,010
I was, like, trying to, I was looking through the settings, and I was, like, which one?

180
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:04,270
Because there's push-to-talk.

181
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:07,950
There's proximity chat, but there's also push-to-talk.

182
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:10,370
So I was, like, obviously, we should do push-to-talk.

183
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:12,950
Oh, yeah, it has a built-in proximity chat.

184
00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:17,190
But, like, I don't know how push-to-talk works for it, because it doesn't say in the settings.

185
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:19,490
But it says it exists.

186
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:28,070
And you can also, like, use a transmitter to, like, just talk to Kira.

187
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:31,710
So you can, like, Kira can, like, communicate with you and stuff.

188
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:35,890
So, like, he, like, and then, like, you're supposed to figure out which one's L and which one's Kira.

189
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:46,910
And then when you're in the Among Us meeting, you can do, like, if you're L or Kira, you can, or if you're L, you can do, like, anonymous messages and be, like, L thinks this person is Kira.

190
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:48,430
But you don't know who's L.

191
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:49,850
You don't know who it is.

192
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:53,170
So, like, it just comes up in the meeting room.

193
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:56,630
And the L would be, like, I think this person is Kira.

194
00:14:56,950 --> 00:14:58,010
But you don't know who it is.

195
00:14:58,010 --> 00:14:58,370
It said that.

196
00:14:58,450 --> 00:14:59,250
It just shows up.

197
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:03,030
It's, like, there's so much mechanics.

198
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:04,250
I was, like, it's so interesting.

199
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:10,990
I don't, I told the girls, because I told the girls, I was, like, there is a tutorial and it is a little bit confusing.

200
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:16,030
So, so, I was, like, I was, like, you guys should try it.

201
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:20,510
Look, look into the tutorial, because I was, like, there were so many things going on.

202
00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:26,050
Anyway, today is the newest season of Apex Legends.

203
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:40,170
I didn't leak anything, but I did give you guys a little hint, because I was invited to check out the, like, I, it wasn't a play test, but it was more so of, like, a video demonstration of all the new updates before the update came out.

204
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:41,530
I think, like, two weeks ago.

205
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:48,250
And for those who don't know, the time to kill is even higher now.

206
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:59,150
It's, it's because support, they basically retooled support into something crazy good.

207
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:01,250
Like, they basically made support insane.

208
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:11,070
So, like, you can do, so when you rez somebody as a support character, they have regen and everything, so they can regenerate and they have faster revive speed.

209
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:20,230
And then they retooled Lifeline to have different abilities, so her ult is different, her abilities are different, everything is basically different.

210
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:21,610
So support is meta now.

211
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:28,090
So, yeah, they basically, if you're a support character and you revive someone, they have regen.

212
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:31,350
So it's not like they're, yeah, they're super busted.

213
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:36,090
And apparently you have two supports, you can chain the rez because it's regenerating.

214
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:39,650
So support mains are basically eating good today.

215
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:43,710
Other than that, they changed the battle pass, but who cares about that?

216
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:47,370
By the way, today I got sponsored by Apex.

217
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:51,170
Huge shout out to EA and Respawn for sponsoring me today.

218
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:56,630
If you guys didn't watch, see the video, they sponsored me to make a video to talk about my Apex story.

219
00:16:56,750 --> 00:17:03,590
So, like, how I got started with Apex and everything and, like, what I love about the game and everything.

220
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:04,770
So please check it out.

221
00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:08,430
I know it's, like, in the video category, but it's supposed to be a short and I don't...

222
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:14,610
Apparently you can now upload three minute, like, up to three minutes for a short, but it's, like, super buggy and everything.

223
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:17,610
So, like, yeah, but yeah, check it out.

224
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:21,550
Check out the sponsored video.

225
00:17:22,330 --> 00:17:30,370
It always is really amazing to be sponsored by Apex because, like, you know, I played that game for free for so long and now they pay me to play.

226
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:34,690
And now they pay me to play their game.

227
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:39,590
And, you know, it's nice, you know, it's very nice.

228
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:43,070
So, yes.

229
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:48,270
So today we're going to be checking out what they change when it comes to Apex.

230
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:50,790
So I'll show you guys the lifeline changes and everything.

231
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:52,730
I should really look at the patch.

232
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:54,210
I never look at the patch notes.

233
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:56,890
I just learn it live.

234
00:17:58,230 --> 00:17:59,930
But yeah, season 23.

235
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:02,270
So it's today's lifeline day.

236
00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:04,590
Okay, launch royale.

237
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:06,390
Basically, the Gibby shield.

238
00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:08,210
It's now... what was it?

239
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:09,510
It was like from 30.

240
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:14,090
The cooldown is now like 17 seconds instead of 30 seconds, which is really crazy.

241
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:16,690
Ghostly Trash Can, thank you for the super chat.

242
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:17,010
Thank you.

243
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:17,530
Thank you.

244
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:18,390
Hey, Toki.

245
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:19,990
My birthday is in a couple of days.

246
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:21,490
Can I get an early happy birthday?

247
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:22,770
Also, hello, Dragos.

248
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:25,510
Thank you for your very first super chat, Trash Can.

249
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:25,830
Thank you.

250
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:26,310
Thank you.

251
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:26,830
Of course.

252
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:28,210
Happy early birthday.

253
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:30,250
Happy birthday to you.

254
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:31,790
Happy birthday to you.

255
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:34,090
Happy early birthday to Trash Can.

256
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:35,510
Happy birthday to you.

257
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:36,130
Yeah!

258
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:40,650
All right, let's see the new video.

259
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,360
I... oh.

260
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:46,960
Oh my gosh, what the f...

261
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,060
Okay, I guess not.

262
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:51,480
It's so annoying.

263
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:53,760
I always have to like re-register.

264
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:58,900
Ever since I moved, they're always like, where are you?

265
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,280
I'm like, remember?

266
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:03,280
They never remember this advice.

267
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,680
It's so fucking annoying.

268
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,040
I don't know what to do.

269
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,720
They never remember it.

270
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:10,100
I've been... I have to do it every time I boot up Apex.

271
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,160
And it's so fucking annoying.

272
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:14,600
They're just like, who are you?

273
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,220
What are you doing here?

274
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:16,620
No!

275
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:17,580
Wait, I wanna watch!

276
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:19,960
I need to watch the video.

277
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,100
All right, there you go.

278
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:27,500
Why is it... oh my god, it's like the OG.

279
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:30,420
Oh.

280
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:40,080
Oh.

281
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:43,140
Feels like the OG.

282
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,700
It's like... it's the OG season.

283
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:48,120
Yeah, it's like the season one.

284
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:52,540
This game has lore?

285
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,180
It used to be more lore.

286
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:56,360
Oh my god.

287
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:58,560
I don't know if he's gay, by the way.

288
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:00,180
You guys have no chance.

289
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,140
Unless you're... you're gay too.

290
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:14,250
I'm a dude, let's go!

291
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:17,930
I have a chance!

292
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:26,710
Is that Fuse?

293
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:29,890
Wait, who's you?

294
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:37,960
Oh my god, I'm...

295
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,840
Oh, y'all know I'm not gonna be killing anyone.

296
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,900
Oh my god, I'm better!

297
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:45,860
Blisk?

298
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:47,640
Oh, is that... oh, Blisk.

299
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,260
Oh, he's a villain from...

300
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:51,060
I don't remember.

301
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,440
It's been so long since I played Titanfall 2.

302
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,280
I don't remember the names.

303
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,820
I actually don't remember their names.

304
00:20:58,140 --> 00:20:59,100
Oh my god!

305
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:01,520
Wait, this is actual OG!

306
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,400
Wait, what the fuck?

307
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:06,140
Wait!

308
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,180
This is like...

309
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,580
OG, OG Apex!

310
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,660
Oh my god!

311
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:16,780
Wait, that's crazy!

312
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:20,160
Oh my god, we're back!

313
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:21,040
We're back!

314
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,520
Oh, this is my prime.

315
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,060
This is... okay, I want to know.

316
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:26,160
This is my peak right here.

317
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,660
Oh, it's a...

318
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:30,360
Oh my god, and we're back!

319
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:31,400
Wait, is it...

320
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:33,500
Is it Classic King's Canyon?

321
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:36,340
No, I don't think so.

322
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,820
I... no, wait.

323
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,120
Did they bring back...

324
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:41,980
Did they bring back Classic King's Canyon?

325
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:43,020
Oh my god, we're...

326
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,100
Oh my god, we're back again!

327
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,080
Oh my... okay, okay, we gotta...

328
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:49,140
Why was it tutorial?

329
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:51,160
Oh, get me out of here.

330
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:52,980
I accidentally put tutorial.

331
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:55,740
Oh my god, we're back!

332
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:58,060
We're actually back!

333
00:21:58,140 --> 00:21:59,120
Sorry, I went to tutorial.

334
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:00,820
I went back back.

335
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:06,980
Oh my god, Skulltown's back, baby!

336
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,840
I love OG Skulltown.

337
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:12,640
Actually...

338
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,580
Wait, did they revert everything including the bunny hop?

339
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:16,400
I would imagine.

340
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:23,060
Maybe you could like reverse bunny hop?

341
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:25,240
No, they didn't.

342
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,140
That would be so funny if they could...

343
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:28,120
If they reverse...

344
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,640
We could heal while bunny hopping.

345
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:31,640
I don't think we can.

346
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,580
I don't think we're back back.

347
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,180
There's no way.

348
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:41,740
There's no...

349
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:42,940
Wait, there is?!

350
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:44,320
We can...

351
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:44,680
Oh my

352
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:54,020
god!

353
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:54,580
Oh my...

354
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:55,640
Okay, wait, okay.

355
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:56,580
How do I get...

356
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:57,600
Damn it, I need to get a name.

357
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,440
Oh my god, we're actually back back.

358
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:01,500
Oh my god.

359
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,460
Wait, wait, I'm actually really happy.

360
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,120
I learned how to...

361
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:10,360
I learned how to like heal bunny hop.

362
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:12,180
And then they took it away from me.

363
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:14,320
Okay, let's see.

364
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:14,920
Where...

365
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:15,860
Where are the names?

366
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:17,800
Oh my god, where the fuck are the...

367
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:18,820
Where are the names?

368
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:19,320
Where...

369
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,220
Where are they?

370
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:21,080
Okay, there you go.

371
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:22,860
All right.

372
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:24,480
Okay.

373
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:26,980
Come on.

374
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:27,740
All right, nice.

375
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:28,740
All right.

376
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,000
Oh my god.

377
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,820
No, I can't get it correctly.

378
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:36,020
It's been too long.

379
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:39,440
Oh my god!

380
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,660
I'm doing it!

381
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,460
Oh my god!

382
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,940
Oh, I can do it again!

383
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:47,860
Okay, I'm sorry.

384
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:48,580
I'm really happy.

385
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:50,200
I'm actually so happy.

386
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:52,240
You know what I said?

387
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:55,620
I'm really happy, guys.

388
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:58,960
Like, I learned how to do that and then they fucking took it away.

389
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:04,860
So basically, for those who don't remember, it's basically...

390
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:07,100
If you close your eyes...

391
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,760
If you...

392
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:16,500
I did the thing.

393
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:22,560
Does it almost feel like nothing's changed at all?

394
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:24,760
Anyway, this is the new ult.

395
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:28,300
It's basically a shield and fast heals.

396
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:29,500
So...

397
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:31,440
Okay, I shouldn't have used it.

398
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:32,900
So if I do this...

399
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:34,520
And then...

400
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:37,100
Does it feel like...

401
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,100
Oh wait, I need to...

402
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:42,800
Does it feel like nothing's changed at all?

403
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:46,430
And you can...

404
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:48,700
And these move now.

405
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:52,120
These move now, by the way.

406
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:54,900
You can like, send it to your teammates and stuff and everything.

407
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:58,280
Oh my god, I'm so happy.

408
00:24:58,960 --> 00:24:59,620
I'm so...

409
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:00,620
You guys don't understand.

410
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:03,900
I love healing.

411
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:06,260
Bhopping and healing.

412
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:09,040
Oh my god!

413
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,480
Maybe I'll try this season.

414
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:17,520
Wait, wait, I'm so happy.

415
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:19,120
I'm actually so happy.

416
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:22,060
Okay, and then you can glide.

417
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:22,600
I heard...

418
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:23,360
I know about the glide.

419
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:24,560
So...

420
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:28,200
Oh my god.

421
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,640
Watch this.

422
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,840
I'm sorry, I'm really kidding because like...

423
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:42,500
Oh my god, old Apex is back.

424
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:49,080
I love old Apex so much.

425
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:51,660
I can do this, guys.

426
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:52,700
I can do this.

427
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:56,160
Oh my god.

428
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:58,440
I can do this, guys.

429
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,480
Oh my god.

430
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:01,920
You guys don't understand.

431
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:04,320
This is my favorite part.

432
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:07,040
This is literally...

433
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,960
This is my happy moment right here.

434
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,960
This is my happy...

435
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:19,500
I haven't done it in so long.

436
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:21,100
But I still got it.

437
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:23,020
I still got it.

438
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:25,340
I can still reverse Bhop heal.

439
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,060
Oh my god.

440
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:28,720
Okay, anyway.

441
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:29,820
This is my happy place.

442
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:32,100
They're gonna take it away and I'll be so sad again.

443
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:32,860
They're gonna...

444
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:35,240
I know they're gonna take this away from me.

445
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:37,960
What is the new abilities?

446
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,720
Increase the time before it runs out of fuel.

447
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:42,500
Okay, this one has to be good.

448
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:44,000
Tactical cooldown.

449
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,920
Increase the distance you can assign by 50.

450
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:50,680
I feel like the tactical cooldown would be better.

451
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:54,040
Oh, the muscle memory is coming back.

452
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:55,340
All right, what are the other things?

453
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:55,680
Okay.

454
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,140
Heal drone upgrades.

455
00:26:58,340 --> 00:26:59,060
Rift relics.

456
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:02,940
Turn around provides contestants with powerful weapons.

457
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:04,760
New support class perks.

458
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:09,280
Can now move at a full speed while healing.

459
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:14,500
Healing amounts from small meds is doubled.

460
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:18,640
Support ledges now have 25% faster revives.

461
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:23,040
Um, the health regen will restore an ally to full health.

462
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:24,720
Oh my...

463
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,140
Full HP?

464
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:27,920
That's...

465
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,200
Oh, but you can stop it.

466
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,920
If they get damaged, you can...

467
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,060
They can stop the regen.

468
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,280
Oh, that's...

469
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,460
That's actually insane though.

470
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,240
Full HP...

471
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:39,260
If you revive somebody, they get full HP.

472
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:40,260
Full HP regen.

473
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,120
Um...

474
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,320
Support legends will also revive...

475
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:47,920
Receive this health regen if revived.

476
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:48,280
Okay.

477
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:58,420
Support legends can see mobile respawn beacons inside death boxes.

478
00:27:58,800 --> 00:27:59,600
All right.

479
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:07,840
And collecting banners will automatically take a mobile respawn beacon and an ally death box.

480
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:08,520
Wow.

481
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:11,820
So basically, when you take the banner, you don't have to loot the box.

482
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:13,560
You can basically get the...

483
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:15,300
Um...

484
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:17,200
You can get the mobile thing instantly.

485
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:17,520
Okay.

486
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,860
Devotion is back on the floor.

487
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:19,660
Havoc...

488
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:20,060
Oh god.

489
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,520
Havoc is a care package weapon.

490
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:23,460
That sounds so fucking scary.

491
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:25,240
L-star is a gold gun.

492
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:25,960
Mastiff.

493
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:26,860
Uh...

494
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:27,360
Lupin.

495
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:28,060
Reset.

496
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,440
Boosted loader.

497
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:30,260
Gunshield generator.

498
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:30,980
Hammer point.

499
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:32,960
Um...

500
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:33,600
Guns.

501
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:35,340
I don't think it really matters too much.

502
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:36,620
Uh...

503
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:37,360
Revive.

504
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:38,520
Connuit.

505
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:39,620
What?

506
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:41,840
Each support character has different...

507
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:42,140
Okay.

508
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:43,500
What?

509
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:45,680
Wait.

510
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:46,720
Oh my god.

511
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,400
Surveillance drone now takes rain.

512
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:50,640
Oh, surveillance drone now takes rain.

513
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:51,660
Thank fucking god.

514
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:55,100
Thank fucking god.

515
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:55,880
All right.

516
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,640
None of these are very important to me.

517
00:28:58,020 --> 00:28:58,420
All right.

518
00:28:58,500 --> 00:28:59,300
Oh my god.

519
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,440
I'm so happy, guys.

520
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:01,640
I'm so happy.

521
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:09,100
Each legend has had the majority of stats and abilities reverted to the first season.

522
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:11,680
You know what that means.

523
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:12,340
Wait!

524
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:16,520
Wait, does that mean Pathfinder's hitbox is back?

525
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:20,200
Wait, does that mean Pathfinder's hitbox is the same as...

526
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,180
Wait a minute.

527
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:25,420
Do you guys remember Pathfinder's hitbox?

528
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:29,600
Do you guys remember...

529
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,200
Pathfinder's hitbox?

530
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,940
It's back to first season.

531
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:37,860
I remember Pathfinder's...

532
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:38,880
No, it's the same!

533
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:39,440
No!

534
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:42,730
No!

535
00:29:43,690 --> 00:29:44,930
There's no way.

536
00:29:45,330 --> 00:29:46,250
There's no way.

537
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:46,910
They must...

538
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:47,890
Oh my god, please.

539
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:48,870
Okay, we're gonna see.

540
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:51,630
I'm gonna see if the Pathfinder's hitbox is the same.

541
00:29:55,430 --> 00:29:56,590
That's fine.

542
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:01,030
Oh my god, Wraith's insta kill.

543
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:02,850
Oh my god!

544
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:06,570
Oh my god, wait!

545
00:30:07,010 --> 00:30:07,390
Wait!

546
00:30:07,850 --> 00:30:09,130
Wraith's insta kill.

547
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:11,030
Oh my god, I remember.

548
00:30:11,890 --> 00:30:12,450
Wait, okay.

549
00:30:12,910 --> 00:30:14,230
We introduce Pudge Priestess now.

550
00:30:14,390 --> 00:30:14,870
Infinity!

551
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:15,590
Infinity!

552
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:17,570
Jump on ziplines!

553
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:21,170
Okay, shields are not automatically regenerated.

554
00:30:21,330 --> 00:30:22,710
Not exclusive to gold armor.

555
00:30:22,870 --> 00:30:24,490
Oh my god, gold armor regen.

556
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:25,750
Oh my god.

557
00:30:25,810 --> 00:30:26,730
Okay, armor core has...

558
00:30:26,730 --> 00:30:28,530
Each piece is pickup only and does not evolve.

559
00:30:29,150 --> 00:30:30,030
Oh my god, nice.

560
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:30,290
Okay.

561
00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:31,570
Don't worry.

562
00:30:31,670 --> 00:30:32,530
Okay, okay.

563
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:35,070
But they made the loot table in King's Canyon.

564
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:35,950
Fucking shit again.

565
00:30:36,330 --> 00:30:41,710
If you guys don't remember, season one of King's Canyon loot pool was very, very bad.

566
00:30:42,690 --> 00:30:44,210
Gold knockdown is self revive.

567
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:46,130
Gold backpack is fast heal.

568
00:30:46,610 --> 00:30:49,130
Gold armor is shield regeneration.

569
00:30:49,770 --> 00:30:50,610
No laser sights.

570
00:30:50,770 --> 00:30:51,750
Okay, wait!

571
00:30:53,490 --> 00:30:54,990
What was it on wingman?

572
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:56,070
That was super good.

573
00:30:56,650 --> 00:30:57,870
Oh my god, wait.

574
00:30:57,870 --> 00:30:59,190
Golden head...

575
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:01,010
Global headshot damage is now 2.0.

576
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:02,430
Regenerates on all weapons.

577
00:31:02,690 --> 00:31:04,830
Fuck, what was the best guns in season one?

578
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:06,450
It's been so long!

579
00:31:07,670 --> 00:31:09,330
Guys, I don't remember...

580
00:31:09,330 --> 00:31:09,710
No!

581
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:11,450
Okay, I'll play Wraith.

582
00:31:13,370 --> 00:31:14,410
Wait, sculpt!

583
00:31:14,890 --> 00:31:16,590
R9 is back, baby!

584
00:31:19,170 --> 00:31:20,890
R9 is back!

585
00:31:25,490 --> 00:31:27,850
R9 wingman, we're fucking back!

586
00:31:27,870 --> 00:31:30,390
You know what I look like.

587
00:31:30,730 --> 00:31:31,330
Come find me.

588
00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:34,650
Holy shit.

589
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:40,440
Oh my god.

590
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:41,840
Oh my god.

591
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:46,060
It's like nothing's changed at all.

592
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,740
You close your eyes.

593
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:51,420
You're so back.

594
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:54,740
Oh my god, you're so fucking back.

595
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,080
I'm so happy.

596
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:59,160
I can't wait to blast people.

597
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,400
With an R9.

598
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:03,720
Oh, let's fucking go!

599
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:09,540
If you close your- We can put a sniper scope on the wingman again!

600
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:11,360
Wait, wait, can we actually?

601
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:13,300
Oh my god, let's go die.

602
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:17,060
Wait, we can stack this!

603
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:19,340
Let's go, let's go die, guys.

604
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:21,480
This is like a really bad idea.

605
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,940
But, because we landed late.

606
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,120
Okay.

607
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:30,320
Oh my god, did you- This is a very bad idea.

608
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:32,940
We were so back.

609
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:35,220
Holy shit.

610
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:37,160
Okay.

611
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:40,740
Alrighty, let's go.

612
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:44,520
Wait, the wingman is shit with a digi in season one.

613
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:50,020
I remember the wingman not being the best with a digi.

614
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,060
I'll just put it on this one.

615
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:53,080
There we go.

616
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:58,560
There's nothing changed at all.

617
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,840
Can I close my eyes?

618
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,020
R400!

619
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,100
Wait, you're right!

620
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,040
The R400!

621
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:10,660
Okay, I'm gonna- Oh my god, it's so weird.

622
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:12,980
It's actually so fucking weird.

623
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:15,660
Grab a fucking armor, guys!

624
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:22,340
Oh my god, the fire rate is crazy.

625
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:24,760
I'm not used to it at all.

626
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:27,520
Oh fuck.

627
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:32,360
Let's see, we're fine.

628
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,400
It's been a while since I played wingman.

629
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:35,760
They don't know.

630
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:36,740
They actually don't know.

631
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:39,300
Oh yeah?

632
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:40,020
No.

633
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:42,400
Just armor swap.

634
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:43,600
Just armor swap.

635
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:45,520
It's literally- We're back!

636
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,640
Oh my god, there's a choke too.

637
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:51,240
Where?

638
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:56,860
Oh my god, the fucking fire rate!

639
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:59,180
Oh, you think I don't see you?

640
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:06,040
Oh yeah?

641
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:11,100
Oh shit, I thought that was a body.

642
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,560
Holy fuck.

643
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:16,880
I'm coming over, Pathfinder!

644
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,360
Oh wait, what?

645
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:21,940
This is not fair.

646
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:23,320
No!

647
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:27,960
Holy fuck!

648
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:30,120
I'm not used to the fire rate.

649
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:33,860
I'm not used to the wingman fire rate.

650
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:35,020
It's so weird.

651
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:38,900
It's actually so- It's so fast again!

652
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:42,480
Oh my god.

653
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:45,980
Oh, it's not my fault.

654
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:50,340
Our bloodhound was- Our bloodhound was a little special.

655
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:53,080
Our bloodhound was special.

656
00:34:57,690 --> 00:34:58,350
Yeah!

657
00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:03,790
Back when- Back when the game was all about skill.

658
00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:05,630
Actually no, people die so fast.

659
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:11,670
Oh my god.

660
00:35:12,090 --> 00:35:14,750
Okay, I want to know if Pathfinder's hitbox is the same.

661
00:35:15,410 --> 00:35:16,510
Call him trash?

662
00:35:16,630 --> 00:35:18,230
Okay, like, look.

663
00:35:18,790 --> 00:35:24,910
I don't want to make fun of somebody who might be like, you know, having a rough- He might be a dad, okay?

664
00:35:25,330 --> 00:35:26,770
He might have called off work.

665
00:35:26,770 --> 00:35:28,590
He might have called off work today.

666
00:35:28,850 --> 00:35:30,310
Be like, oh my god, season 23.

667
00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:32,410
Season 23 is coming out.

668
00:35:32,590 --> 00:35:33,530
I can't, I can't.

669
00:35:33,570 --> 00:35:36,150
If you call him sick, you know, he's working a nine to five.

670
00:35:36,530 --> 00:35:43,470
Then he's like, oh my god, I remember when I used to play season one before I got this job.

671
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:53,560
Pathfinder's hitbox?

672
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,540
I thought they did!

673
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:57,370
Season one, um...

674
00:35:58,370 --> 00:36:02,130
Season one, Pathfinder hitbox was like, so fucking broken.

675
00:36:02,330 --> 00:36:03,670
He was like a little skeleton.

676
00:36:04,450 --> 00:36:09,730
Uh, call him sick to throw- Oh, shit, I went back to work.

677
00:36:10,770 --> 00:36:12,690
Just went back to work.

678
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:17,330
Oh my god.

679
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:19,110
All right, we'll see.

680
00:36:19,350 --> 00:36:24,570
We'll see if the- We'll see if Pathfinder's hitbox is the same or not.

681
00:36:25,130 --> 00:36:28,250
If it's still like, it's so weird just seeing this.

682
00:36:29,330 --> 00:36:35,750
Even the icons are like, the old icons too, which is- Which is so weird to see.

683
00:36:35,870 --> 00:36:39,190
Like, I'm pretty sure that was not Wraith's icon back, like now.

684
00:36:40,810 --> 00:36:41,510
All right.

685
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:43,910
Here we go.

686
00:36:45,210 --> 00:36:45,570
Oh!

687
00:36:46,690 --> 00:36:49,710
Yeah, the 144p icons.

688
00:36:50,210 --> 00:36:51,670
Oh, it's so good to be back.

689
00:36:51,730 --> 00:36:52,390
I'm so happy.

690
00:36:55,050 --> 00:36:56,350
Happy, happy, happy.

691
00:36:58,290 --> 00:36:59,090
The nostalgia.

692
00:37:01,950 --> 00:37:03,370
I hate this game.

693
00:37:03,770 --> 00:37:05,090
Oh, but you always come back.

694
00:37:05,350 --> 00:37:06,550
You always come back.

695
00:37:06,990 --> 00:37:07,750
Is that Thunderdome?

696
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:09,230
I'm gonna drop in Thunderdome.

697
00:37:09,290 --> 00:37:10,050
This is what I do.

698
00:37:10,150 --> 00:37:16,470
I would drop at Thunderdome and then go to Skulltown the third- Oh my god, we can fight on the Thunderdome!

699
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:18,050
Oh my god, I miss Thunderdome.

700
00:37:18,050 --> 00:37:19,430
I'm alone.

701
00:37:23,810 --> 00:37:25,130
Oh my god.

702
00:37:29,890 --> 00:37:32,330
Oh my god, Thunderdome.

703
00:37:33,430 --> 00:37:35,270
Oh, Thunderdome!

704
00:37:38,890 --> 00:37:39,990
Let's go!

705
00:37:40,770 --> 00:37:42,970
Let's all die in Thunderdome!

706
00:37:46,970 --> 00:37:48,530
It's nostalgia bait.

707
00:37:49,310 --> 00:37:51,390
It's literally nostalgia bait right now.

708
00:37:51,990 --> 00:37:54,550
And I'm all for it!

709
00:37:55,290 --> 00:37:58,410
I'm gonna- I eat that shit up!

710
00:38:01,330 --> 00:38:04,230
Oh my god, they know exactly what I want.

711
00:38:07,510 --> 00:38:09,030
Oh my god.

712
00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:11,630
And they know what I want.

713
00:38:11,870 --> 00:38:12,230
Ah, fuck you.

714
00:38:12,310 --> 00:38:12,950
I get baited.

715
00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:13,550
That's fine.

716
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:14,690
Bait me all you want.

717
00:38:14,730 --> 00:38:15,870
I'm falling for it.

718
00:38:16,130 --> 00:38:17,230
It doesn't matter.

719
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:21,470
Feed me!

720
00:38:22,310 --> 00:38:26,410
Oh, I forgive you, Apex, for every other bad shit you've done.

721
00:38:26,830 --> 00:38:30,050
This is all I care about.

722
00:38:31,430 --> 00:38:33,730
Oh my god, it's R400 now.

723
00:38:34,850 --> 00:38:37,810
The bait's too good.

724
00:38:39,310 --> 00:38:40,230
It's too good.

725
00:38:41,870 --> 00:38:44,810
Oh my god, I love Thunderdome.

726
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:46,130
Thunderdome!

727
00:38:46,970 --> 00:38:47,210
Thunderdome!

728
00:38:48,530 --> 00:38:50,090
Oh my god, Peacekeeper!

729
00:38:50,510 --> 00:38:51,690
I just need wingman!

730
00:38:52,050 --> 00:38:53,050
Or I die!

731
00:38:53,870 --> 00:38:55,350
Yeah, slide punching is back.

732
00:38:55,770 --> 00:38:56,750
Punch boost is back.

733
00:38:57,350 --> 00:38:57,550
Watch.

734
00:38:59,090 --> 00:38:59,810
Oh, fuck.

735
00:39:03,610 --> 00:39:04,110
Okay.

736
00:39:09,830 --> 00:39:11,390
They know what I like.

737
00:39:12,270 --> 00:39:14,690
And I will- I will get baited.

738
00:39:14,730 --> 00:39:15,310
I don't care.

739
00:39:17,070 --> 00:39:18,730
They can bait me all they want.

740
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:24,040
They can bait me all they want.

741
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:25,520
I'm weak.

742
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,340
Oh, I'm so weak!

743
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:43,280
Oh my god.

744
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,480
They know exactly.

745
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:47,520
This is- I am the target audience.

746
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:50,640
No!

747
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:52,660
They're so low!

748
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:53,420
Please!

749
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,300
Pathfinder, don't be a little bitch!

750
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,020
They're so low!

751
00:39:58,120 --> 00:39:59,020
It's literally lifeline!

752
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:00,580
I'm so safe.

753
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,080
I'm so safe.

754
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:03,780
Watson, Watson, Watson, are you support?

755
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:05,080
You're support, right?

756
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:08,080
Come on.

757
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:11,680
No, he's not support.

758
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:12,860
I fucked up.

759
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:13,900
No!

760
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:15,420
I forgot.

761
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:21,640
Oh my god.

762
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:22,560
You know what?

763
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,000
I think I did pretty well, though.

764
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:28,520
There was just a lot more people.

765
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,440
Oh, there's more?!

766
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:34,520
Okay, that's not fair.

767
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:35,420
He got an R9.

768
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:40,140
He's got- Oh, the class perks don't exist!

769
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:40,840
Oh, fuck.

770
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:41,240
You're right.

771
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:41,640
I forgot.

772
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:44,000
The class perks don't exist.

773
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:47,100
Oh, I'm feeling it.

774
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,760
I'm feeling the skill coming back in me right now.

775
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:51,960
I'm feeling it, guys.

776
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:56,280
Bathroom real quick.

777
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:57,780
I'll be right back.

778
00:42:12,570 --> 00:42:12,750
Damn.

779
00:42:13,110 --> 00:42:15,010
That means we're back to old lifeline.

780
00:42:15,490 --> 00:42:17,630
I don't remember what season lifeline was.

781
00:42:17,630 --> 00:42:19,610
What does season 1 lifeline have?

782
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:24,400
Remember?

783
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,140
It's been so long.

784
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:28,160
What was season 1 lifeline?

785
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:32,320
Shield unrest?

786
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:33,180
Oh, the shield!

787
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:33,480
Okay.

788
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:37,980
Okay, heal him.

789
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:40,120
Wait, season 1 lifeline was meta.

790
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:41,960
I remember now.

791
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:43,340
Oh my god, it's coming back to me.

792
00:42:44,580 --> 00:42:45,280
Season 1 lifeline.

793
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:45,780
Oh, fuck.

794
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:46,620
Season 1.

795
00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:47,320
Oh, fuck this place.

796
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:48,260
Season 1.

797
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:49,500
Season 1 lifeline.

798
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:51,460
That was meta.

799
00:42:51,580 --> 00:42:53,740
And then I'll just heal and ring until everybody's dead.

800
00:42:56,260 --> 00:42:58,140
Do you remember?

801
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:05,280
When everyone just healed and zoned for season 1 lifeline.

802
00:43:06,580 --> 00:43:09,820
That was literally the only thing people did.

803
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:12,820
I'm back.

804
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:14,880
She was everything I wanted.

805
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:15,940
That is not true.

806
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:17,500
The new lifeline is so much better.

807
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:19,020
I feel like.

808
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:20,160
I think new lifeline.

809
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,360
New lifeline shit is so strong.

810
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:25,280
The zone ratting.

811
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:25,900
It's time.

812
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:27,140
It's time, guys.

813
00:43:27,620 --> 00:43:31,300
I'm gonna queue solo in one of the games and then I'm just gonna stay in zone.

814
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:36,380
I'm gonna do it.

815
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:38,280
What the fuck?

816
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:39,840
How?

817
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:40,200
How?

818
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:44,140
Alright.

819
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:45,320
This is a little awkward.

820
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:46,800
Oh, I think these guys are gamers.

821
00:43:47,260 --> 00:43:51,960
Oh my god.

822
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:52,240
Okay.

823
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:53,420
This is bad.

824
00:43:58,340 --> 00:43:59,500
Oh my god.

825
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:01,220
This is bad.

826
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:03,700
Alright.

827
00:44:03,820 --> 00:44:04,760
I hope you're helping.

828
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:07,480
Where are they?

829
00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:09,380
Oh, what the fuck?

830
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:12,280
Oh shit.

831
00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:14,300
Oh my god.

832
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:16,040
I'm getting crossed so hard.

833
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:22,760
I'm getting crossed so hard.

834
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:24,860
Alright.

835
00:44:25,220 --> 00:44:26,400
I know what to do, guys.

836
00:44:27,380 --> 00:44:27,700
Wait.

837
00:44:28,620 --> 00:44:30,140
Yeah, I got cross fired.

838
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:30,960
Okay, guys.

839
00:44:30,980 --> 00:44:31,440
This is it.

840
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:33,800
I know what to do.

841
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:35,960
Oh, there's no field.

842
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:36,440
Damn it.

843
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:36,780
Fuck.

844
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:37,020
Okay.

845
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:41,560
I was gonna do the zone ratting.

846
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:43,900
I was just gonna play like...

847
00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:47,800
Cause I assume ring damage is season one ring damage too.

848
00:44:48,280 --> 00:45:01,640
So season one ring damage for those who don't remember you can literally just stay in the zone as lifeline and just heal until everybody's dead.

849
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:07,360
So that was what's in my head.

850
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:08,380
I was like, oh my god.

851
00:45:08,380 --> 00:45:09,180
I could do that again.

852
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:13,780
I could actually just stay in the zone and not care.

853
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:26,960
People get through the day and then that's when ring damage was introduced.

854
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:30,320
Stronger ring damage was introduced.

855
00:45:39,810 --> 00:45:40,470
Oh my god.

856
00:45:40,490 --> 00:45:41,370
I need to get cough drops.

857
00:45:41,770 --> 00:45:45,790
I don't know why, but today I'm coughing way more than yesterday.

858
00:45:46,050 --> 00:45:48,430
But I ran out of cough drops like two days ago.

859
00:45:48,730 --> 00:45:50,470
Cause I thought I was getting better.

860
00:45:50,470 --> 00:45:56,270
And then like for some reason today there's something about today that my coughing is worse now.

861
00:45:56,690 --> 00:45:57,210
No,

862
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:01,680
I don't think I have the flu.

863
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:05,720
I think it's just my throat today is just not feeling it.

864
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:11,840
I'm definitely gonna order some cough drops before the collab though.

865
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:17,000
No, it started in the morning before my dance classes.

866
00:46:25,930 --> 00:46:28,150
Yeah, the Chinese throat medicine.

867
00:46:28,930 --> 00:46:32,870
I might take some of that too to thicken my throat.

868
00:46:34,830 --> 00:46:35,130
Alright.

869
00:46:37,650 --> 00:46:41,230
Oh my god, this is so weird.

870
00:46:42,190 --> 00:46:46,630
It's actually so fucking weird looking at this right now.

871
00:46:48,830 --> 00:46:50,330
I'm gonna go here.

872
00:46:50,730 --> 00:46:51,170
Fuck it.

873
00:46:51,170 --> 00:46:54,290
We're gonna go to we're gonna go to market.

874
00:46:54,950 --> 00:46:59,310
We go to market, we kill people in market and then we go to Skull Town.

875
00:47:01,250 --> 00:47:02,410
Oh my god.

876
00:47:04,130 --> 00:47:06,730
Yes, the OG!

877
00:47:09,250 --> 00:47:10,910
Alright, this is where war starts.

878
00:47:11,450 --> 00:47:12,070
This is...

879
00:47:12,070 --> 00:47:15,390
This is literally...

880
00:47:17,450 --> 00:47:19,190
I fucked up war guys.

881
00:47:22,830 --> 00:47:24,490
I fucked up.

882
00:47:27,710 --> 00:47:30,210
War did not go so well.

883
00:47:31,970 --> 00:47:33,150
Yep, nice.

884
00:47:34,370 --> 00:47:35,050
Okay.

885
00:47:36,130 --> 00:47:37,870
He doesn't have what I want.

886
00:47:38,610 --> 00:47:39,650
Oh, please.

887
00:47:40,370 --> 00:47:40,850
Please.

888
00:47:41,290 --> 00:47:43,050
I don't have armor.

889
00:47:44,730 --> 00:47:46,550
Wait, I can just...

890
00:47:46,550 --> 00:47:46,790
Alright.

891
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:51,260
Nice.

892
00:47:55,060 --> 00:47:57,120
Oh, I didn't see the bamboozle.

893
00:47:58,280 --> 00:48:01,080
I don't have a lot of ammo right now.

894
00:48:07,150 --> 00:48:07,710
Okay.

895
00:48:12,250 --> 00:48:14,650
Four bullets and a fucking dream.

896
00:48:17,110 --> 00:48:18,310
Lifeline, are you okay?

897
00:48:19,570 --> 00:48:20,470
I think she's okay.

898
00:48:20,730 --> 00:48:21,270
Okay.

899
00:48:22,830 --> 00:48:23,510
This is fine.

900
00:48:24,430 --> 00:48:25,090
This is fine.

901
00:48:26,790 --> 00:48:27,950
This is so fine.

902
00:48:31,050 --> 00:48:32,090
Lifeline, please.

903
00:48:33,150 --> 00:48:34,110
Lifeline, please.

904
00:48:34,170 --> 00:48:34,830
I'm scared.

905
00:48:36,130 --> 00:48:37,690
Oh, Lifeline, please.

906
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:46,160
Oh, fuck.

907
00:48:46,580 --> 00:48:47,120
Yes, okay.

908
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:50,380
Get me out of here!

909
00:48:53,820 --> 00:48:54,300
Okay.

910
00:48:55,100 --> 00:48:55,740
It's fine.

911
00:48:56,420 --> 00:48:58,200
What do you want me to do?

912
00:48:58,520 --> 00:48:59,180
What do you want me to do?

913
00:48:59,220 --> 00:49:01,040
The Lifeline should be helping, not me.

914
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,880
I assumed the Lifeline was gonna help, but I guess not.

915
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:11,480
Alright.

916
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:12,860
Alright!

917
00:49:13,540 --> 00:49:14,600
Lifeline, are you gonna help?

918
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:16,040
Lifeline!

919
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:19,380
She literally watched!

920
00:49:19,940 --> 00:49:20,840
Oh my god!

921
00:49:20,900 --> 00:49:22,000
Oh, you're happy!

922
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:28,280
Not my problem.

923
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:31,860
Oh my god.

924
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:33,940
I still don't have a shield.

925
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:35,460
I still don't think I...

926
00:49:35,460 --> 00:49:36,740
Oh my god, it's time!

927
00:49:36,860 --> 00:49:38,800
I just need...

928
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:40,240
I have R-401!

929
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:42,300
I'm so close to an R-401!

930
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:44,960
Oh my, here we go.

931
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:45,580
We're fine.

932
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:46,760
We're fine.

933
00:49:46,820 --> 00:49:47,840
Everything is fine.

934
00:49:49,100 --> 00:49:49,980
Look at that.

935
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:52,560
We're almost close to R-401, guys.

936
00:49:53,780 --> 00:49:55,480
I definitely need more ammo.

937
00:49:56,580 --> 00:49:56,800
Okay.

938
00:49:58,380 --> 00:49:58,940
Oh!

939
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:02,460
I don't wanna...

940
00:50:02,460 --> 00:50:04,600
I already tried the wingman today.

941
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:06,120
I wanna do the R... I need R-9.

942
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:07,240
I haven't found...

943
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:08,420
Wait a minute.

944
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:10,840
Wait a minute.

945
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,200
Wait a minute, JK.

946
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:13,800
JK.

947
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:15,800
Oh, the Peacekeeper feels so good, too.

948
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:17,600
Oh my god.

949
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:20,980
Guys, even the Peacekeeper feels so good.

950
00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:23,960
The original Peacekeeper.

951
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:25,760
Oh my god.

952
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:27,560
But...

953
00:50:28,580 --> 00:50:31,280
I'm gonna hold on to the carbine for the R-9.

954
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:32,580
I'm so happy.

955
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:33,360
No, you don't understand.

956
00:50:33,460 --> 00:50:34,400
I'm actually so happy.

957
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:35,060
I'm...

958
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:37,800
You know...

959
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:40,560
This is like the apex I fell in love with.

960
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:42,540
Like...

961
00:50:44,020 --> 00:50:44,640
No!

962
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:45,620
No!

963
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:46,220
No!

964
00:50:46,420 --> 00:50:50,760
The way they tweaked the Peacekeeper is not...

965
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:56,860
They tweaked the Peacekeeper so much that it doesn't feel as good as it is like back then.

966
00:50:58,500 --> 00:50:59,860
Because like old...

967
00:50:59,860 --> 00:51:04,860
I have like so much muscle memory from old Peacekeeper that the new Peace...

968
00:51:04,860 --> 00:51:06,860
Oh my god.

969
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:12,880
Are they testing the fire alarm?

970
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:13,800
That was sick, though.

971
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:15,360
That was sick, though.

972
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:19,660
Okay, not gonna lie.

973
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:22,820
That was pretty sick, though.

974
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:29,400
Oh my god.

975
00:52:29,820 --> 00:52:30,700
Oh my god.

976
00:52:30,740 --> 00:52:31,860
I feel like...

977
00:52:31,860 --> 00:52:36,700
Because I'm back to Season 1, I feel like I actually got better.

978
00:52:39,700 --> 00:52:43,720
I'm like locked back in to like old Toki.

979
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:46,280
Like my entire...

980
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:50,300
My Season 1 muscle memory is like kicking in right now.

981
00:52:51,740 --> 00:52:52,880
Even though like...

982
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:57,040
To be fair, I didn't actually start playing this game until Season 2.

983
00:52:57,260 --> 00:53:00,080
But I still played this game a little bit during Season 1.

984
00:53:00,140 --> 00:53:01,520
Just not as committed as I was.

985
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:03,460
Oh my god.

986
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:04,740
Old Toki woke up.

987
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,700
She was like, it's time.

988
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:08,180
It's time.

989
00:53:08,300 --> 00:53:09,340
Return to your roots.

990
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:11,120
Oh, it's so time.

991
00:53:11,300 --> 00:53:12,080
Oh, fuck.

992
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:12,380
Okay.

993
00:53:13,260 --> 00:53:13,740
Fuck!

994
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:15,080
Oh, I'm sorry!

995
00:53:17,100 --> 00:53:17,760
I'm sorry.

996
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:21,380
Carbine Mastiff just hits harder.

997
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:21,980
I'm sorry.

998
00:53:23,540 --> 00:53:24,900
It's just...

999
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:25,800
Oh my god.

1000
00:53:26,140 --> 00:53:27,820
OG Mastiff.

1001
00:53:27,980 --> 00:53:29,920
I remember beating...

1002
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:35,240
When I did Rank and I bumped into TSM back then.

1003
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:35,920
Old TSM.

1004
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:38,640
I like killed them with this.

1005
00:53:39,020 --> 00:53:42,560
I killed them with this gun right here.

1006
00:53:45,460 --> 00:53:46,680
Right here.

1007
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:49,640
I 1v3'd TSM with this.

1008
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:51,220
Oh my god!

1009
00:54:40,810 --> 00:54:42,310
Why are they still testing?

1010
00:54:43,250 --> 00:54:44,770
I don't understand!

1011
00:54:45,790 --> 00:54:47,690
How can they still be testing?

1012
00:54:47,930 --> 00:54:48,730
Oh my god.

1013
00:54:48,850 --> 00:54:49,890
Get this over with.

1014
00:54:52,370 --> 00:54:53,770
Oh my god.

1015
00:54:54,670 --> 00:54:56,230
Let's go to the other side.

1016
00:54:56,750 --> 00:54:57,510
Oh, we can't.

1017
00:54:57,530 --> 00:54:58,550
I feel like we should.

1018
00:55:02,710 --> 00:55:03,930
Oh, he's so low.

1019
00:55:04,230 --> 00:55:05,890
He's actually so low.

1020
00:55:08,450 --> 00:55:09,670
I'll thirst him for you.

1021
00:55:15,830 --> 00:55:18,810
I'm just gonna go here.

1022
00:55:25,450 --> 00:55:26,470
Where are they?

1023
00:55:26,530 --> 00:55:27,350
I hear them.

1024
00:55:27,710 --> 00:55:29,470
I hear them below me.

1025
00:55:31,430 --> 00:55:33,090
I fucking knew it.

1026
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:33,890
I knew it.

1027
00:55:33,930 --> 00:55:34,730
Oh my god!

1028
00:55:34,790 --> 00:55:35,470
This area!

1029
00:55:35,790 --> 00:55:39,010
Oh, I remember now.

1030
00:55:39,570 --> 00:55:40,930
I remember this area.

1031
00:55:42,450 --> 00:55:43,190
I remember this area.

1032
00:55:43,190 --> 00:55:46,150
I was like, this area- Oh my god, this area was so fucked.

1033
00:55:46,370 --> 00:55:48,330
This area was actually so fucking annoying.

1034
00:55:48,730 --> 00:55:49,330
I remember.

1035
00:55:51,190 --> 00:55:53,470
I was just like, this part.

1036
00:55:54,250 --> 00:55:58,070
This fucking- Sorry, Lifeline.

1037
00:55:59,690 --> 00:56:00,710
Good luck.

1038
00:56:11,320 --> 00:56:12,600
Oh my god.

1039
00:56:14,860 --> 00:56:15,320
Oh my god.

1040
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:15,940
Please don't look at me.

1041
00:56:15,980 --> 00:56:17,060
Please don't look at me from above.

1042
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:19,420
Please don't look at me from above.

1043
00:56:20,900 --> 00:56:21,300
No!

1044
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:22,640
No!

1045
00:56:28,290 --> 00:56:30,490
I didn't want to chase.

1046
00:56:31,010 --> 00:56:34,910
But then our Lifeline was like, okay, but what if we did chase?

1047
00:56:35,010 --> 00:56:35,890
And I was like, you know what?

1048
00:56:35,970 --> 00:56:37,990
I believe in my Lifeline.

1049
00:56:38,710 --> 00:56:42,390
I was just like, you know what?

1050
00:56:43,010 --> 00:56:47,550
Surely, our Lifeline wouldn't fuck me over.

1051
00:56:53,350 --> 00:56:55,090
I thought about it.

1052
00:56:55,150 --> 00:56:57,270
I was like, this is a bad idea.

1053
00:56:57,710 --> 00:57:01,430
This is such a bad idea.

1054
00:57:02,750 --> 00:57:05,270
I should- I don't- I never believe.

1055
00:57:05,670 --> 00:57:07,090
Never believe in your Lifeline.

1056
00:57:07,210 --> 00:57:07,630
I forgot.

1057
00:57:07,990 --> 00:57:08,550
Number one.

1058
00:57:09,090 --> 00:57:09,770
Number one.

1059
00:57:09,930 --> 00:57:11,450
Never believe in your Lifeline.

1060
00:57:15,590 --> 00:57:17,170
Never believe in your team.

1061
00:57:17,250 --> 00:57:18,390
Your team is always wrong.

1062
00:57:22,650 --> 00:57:23,810
I thought he had a plan.

1063
00:57:24,690 --> 00:57:26,310
He was so ready.

1064
00:57:26,750 --> 00:57:28,930
He looked like he knew he had his shit together.

1065
00:57:29,510 --> 00:57:30,310
But I was wrong.

1066
00:57:30,530 --> 00:57:32,070
Nobody ever has their shit together.

1067
00:57:34,090 --> 00:57:34,730
Mmm.

1068
00:57:36,790 --> 00:57:40,130
23 seasons actually and I still trust them.

1069
00:57:43,270 --> 00:57:43,290
Wait!

1070
00:57:43,570 --> 00:57:47,110
Does this mean aim assist doesn't work on smokes anymore?

1071
00:57:49,270 --> 00:57:49,910
Wait.

1072
00:57:50,890 --> 00:57:52,130
Wait a minute.

1073
00:57:52,850 --> 00:57:53,870
Wait a minute.

1074
00:57:53,990 --> 00:57:57,570
If I play Bangalore, does that mean even smokes don't work now?

1075
00:57:58,350 --> 00:57:59,530
For real?

1076
00:58:04,810 --> 00:58:05,930
Thank you for the super chat.

1077
00:58:06,030 --> 00:58:06,550
Thank you.

1078
00:58:06,610 --> 00:58:07,250
Just curious.

1079
00:58:07,390 --> 00:58:10,670
Have you asked your apartment to change your air filter since you moved in?

1080
00:58:10,990 --> 00:58:12,830
An old filter could be the reason you're coughing.

1081
00:58:12,910 --> 00:58:13,790
I don't know.

1082
00:58:14,230 --> 00:58:18,290
I think I don't- I think my throat is just uh...

1083
00:58:19,110 --> 00:58:21,390
My throat just feels like weird today.

1084
00:58:22,670 --> 00:58:23,150
Alright.

1085
00:58:23,150 --> 00:58:24,490
You guys do your thing.

1086
00:58:30,610 --> 00:58:31,750
Oh my god.

1087
00:58:32,230 --> 00:58:33,330
I remember this was hell.

1088
00:58:33,810 --> 00:58:34,730
Crossing this pit.

1089
00:58:36,750 --> 00:58:40,150
Crossing this was actually like why is this there?

1090
00:58:41,950 --> 00:58:42,630
Oh hey!

1091
00:58:42,750 --> 00:58:43,370
Hey dad!

1092
00:58:43,910 --> 00:58:44,990
Why are you here?

1093
00:58:48,090 --> 00:58:49,090
Why are you here?

1094
00:58:50,750 --> 00:58:51,150
Alright.

1095
00:58:52,990 --> 00:58:54,470
I have to play Wraith guys.

1096
00:58:54,730 --> 00:58:57,330
Wraith is so good in season 1.

1097
00:58:57,430 --> 00:59:01,190
It was literally like- there was a reason why bald Wraiths were a thing.

1098
00:59:05,110 --> 00:59:05,830
Okay.

1099
00:59:06,110 --> 00:59:06,730
Yep.

1100
00:59:06,850 --> 00:59:07,630
That's- ooh!

1101
00:59:07,810 --> 00:59:10,190
That's a good old season 1 loot!

1102
00:59:10,510 --> 00:59:11,810
If I didn't see it.

1103
00:59:12,250 --> 00:59:13,310
Oh my god.

1104
00:59:13,450 --> 00:59:16,190
Good old season 1 loot pool.

1105
00:59:17,250 --> 00:59:17,970
Woooo!

1106
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:24,640
Man!

1107
00:59:25,220 --> 00:59:27,720
I sure do love getting that thing.

1108
00:59:31,080 --> 00:59:32,220
Aw man.

1109
00:59:32,740 --> 00:59:35,400
That's the season 1 loot pool that I loved!

1110
00:59:37,100 --> 00:59:37,640
Yep!

1111
00:59:38,180 --> 00:59:39,780
That's season 1!

1112
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:44,920
Old season- yay!

1113
00:59:46,860 --> 00:59:48,840
I love getting that thing!

1114
00:59:50,540 --> 00:59:50,860
Alright.

1115
00:59:51,720 --> 00:59:53,000
He's just looking at me.

1116
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:53,940
I don't know why he's here.

1117
00:59:54,020 --> 00:59:56,680
I guess he heard the testing and he didn't like it.

1118
00:59:57,300 --> 00:59:58,080
Oh my god, please.

1119
01:00:00,140 --> 01:00:01,340
Sakuragi, please.

1120
01:00:01,480 --> 01:00:02,560
I'm right here.

1121
01:00:02,560 --> 01:00:04,720
Oh, I look so restable!

1122
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:06,080
Restable!

1123
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:08,180
Look at me go!

1124
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:10,080
It's not like there's anybody here.

1125
01:00:10,120 --> 01:00:11,480
Okay, what will you get out of that?

1126
01:00:11,780 --> 01:00:13,340
What do you get?

1127
01:00:17,020 --> 01:00:19,620
Where's my three white shields in a bin?

1128
01:00:23,580 --> 01:00:25,360
Guys, I literally had no loot.

1129
01:00:25,460 --> 01:00:28,260
You can't- I couldn't do anything, guys.

1130
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:29,020
I couldn't.

1131
01:00:29,020 --> 01:00:30,020
I couldn't.

1132
01:00:30,060 --> 01:00:37,540
I can't believe this is not- I can't believe I'm getting unimmersed from season 1, because I can queue in the loading screen.

1133
01:00:38,440 --> 01:00:41,040
How have I got zero R9s?

1134
01:00:41,180 --> 01:00:45,860
I swear, I found every gun, except for an R9.

1135
01:00:46,040 --> 01:00:48,500
I literally have not found an R9 in this entire game.

1136
01:00:49,700 --> 01:00:53,860
I've been playing for like an hour, and I still have no R9.

1137
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:54,980
Like, how is that possible?

1138
01:00:56,440 --> 01:00:58,100
Actually, how is that possible?

1139
01:01:02,270 --> 01:01:08,770
I need my R9 and a sniper scout on my G7 scout, so I can be like- so I can actually be annoying.

1140
01:01:09,290 --> 01:01:14,870
So I can actually bring back- That's how I got- That's how I got bread.

1141
01:01:16,010 --> 01:01:16,690
Yeah.

1142
01:01:17,130 --> 01:01:18,770
Yeah, that's right.

1143
01:01:19,550 --> 01:01:23,810
I was a- was a dirty G7 scout abuser.

1144
01:01:24,330 --> 01:01:26,010
That's fucking right.

1145
01:01:26,190 --> 01:01:27,730
I own that shit.

1146
01:01:27,930 --> 01:01:34,470
I picked up a G7 scout, put a sniper scope on there, and then go pew pew pew pew pew.

1147
01:01:37,470 --> 01:01:39,390
That was me.

1148
01:01:39,890 --> 01:01:42,050
And then I end the top 500.

1149
01:01:46,010 --> 01:01:55,070
That was so- And you know damn well, I abused the charge- Oh no, charge rifle isn't back.

1150
01:01:55,070 --> 01:02:01,570
I was gonna say- I was also the charge rifle abuser.

1151
01:02:01,950 --> 01:02:03,370
That's fucking right.

1152
01:02:03,990 --> 01:02:06,670
Charge rifle and then they nerfed charge rifle.

1153
01:02:07,070 --> 01:02:09,630
So I went to the G7 scout.

1154
01:02:09,870 --> 01:02:10,850
They can't stop me.

1155
01:02:11,310 --> 01:02:12,490
They couldn't stop me.

1156
01:02:13,710 --> 01:02:15,670
You have no shade?

1157
01:02:16,690 --> 01:02:18,350
Where's your top 500?

1158
01:02:21,710 --> 01:02:26,070
Sorry, can't hear you over the lack of a top 500.

1159
01:02:31,030 --> 01:02:32,370
That's fucking right.

1160
01:02:33,010 --> 01:02:36,370
You only hate me cause I played the meta.

1161
01:02:38,330 --> 01:02:40,990
You were part of the problem.

1162
01:02:41,370 --> 01:02:44,490
You gotta be part of the problem if you want anything in life.

1163
01:02:45,890 --> 01:02:48,070
Can they really blame me?

1164
01:02:51,970 --> 01:02:52,590
What?

1165
01:02:54,670 --> 01:02:59,330
How am I supposed to- Oh my- What?

1166
01:03:00,570 --> 01:03:01,410
Oh, I had no armor.

1167
01:03:01,810 --> 01:03:03,930
I had no armor.

1168
01:03:05,270 --> 01:03:06,770
I was like, how?

1169
01:03:07,270 --> 01:03:11,670
I was like, one shot?

1170
01:03:13,890 --> 01:03:14,710
I forgot.

1171
01:03:15,310 --> 01:03:16,870
I don't come on with armor.

1172
01:03:17,350 --> 01:03:20,810
I don't.

1173
01:03:20,810 --> 01:03:22,650
I didn't go in with armor.

1174
01:03:25,250 --> 01:03:26,310
Okay, look.

1175
01:03:26,690 --> 01:03:28,610
I forgot the fire rate.

1176
01:03:28,890 --> 01:03:31,510
Guys, it's been a while playing wingman, guys.

1177
01:03:33,910 --> 01:03:36,450
Look, guys.

1178
01:03:36,990 --> 01:03:42,090
All I'm saying is that I didn't have the G7 scout or the R9 on me, guys.

1179
01:03:42,510 --> 01:03:46,830
I didn't have the G7 scout or the R9.

1180
01:03:47,130 --> 01:03:47,790
That's why.

1181
01:03:48,270 --> 01:03:49,410
That's the only reason.

1182
01:03:49,650 --> 01:03:52,870
If I had those two guns, it would've been over.

1183
01:03:53,590 --> 01:03:55,290
It would've been over.

1184
01:03:55,430 --> 01:03:56,210
Oh, shit.

1185
01:03:56,310 --> 01:03:56,850
Wait, you're right.

1186
01:03:56,970 --> 01:03:57,730
Wait, give me a sec.

1187
01:03:58,170 --> 01:04:01,210
Wait, since we're in retro land, wait, you're right.

1188
01:04:01,550 --> 01:04:02,670
You're actually right.

1189
01:04:02,770 --> 01:04:04,930
If we're in retro land, we gotta actually go retro.

1190
01:04:06,530 --> 01:04:08,690
Back to the OG times.

1191
01:04:10,470 --> 01:04:11,690
I wonder if it's still over.

1192
01:04:11,810 --> 01:04:13,030
Okay, I think it's this one.

1193
01:04:14,350 --> 01:04:15,790
Is this a...

1194
01:04:15,790 --> 01:04:17,310
Is this a new...

1195
01:04:17,310 --> 01:04:18,450
I don't remember if...

1196
01:04:20,210 --> 01:04:20,970
This is?

1197
01:04:21,090 --> 01:04:22,130
Yeah, I think so.

1198
01:04:22,510 --> 01:04:23,750
Wait, which one is the...

1199
01:04:23,750 --> 01:04:24,950
Which one is my old...

1200
01:04:25,550 --> 01:04:27,510
We're time traveling now.

1201
01:04:28,550 --> 01:04:30,190
We're gonna time travel.

1202
01:04:31,330 --> 01:04:31,870
Okay, yeah.

1203
01:04:31,930 --> 01:04:32,970
This one is this one.

1204
01:04:33,070 --> 01:04:34,370
I had to make sure.

1205
01:04:34,450 --> 01:04:35,270
It's been so long.

1206
01:04:35,670 --> 01:04:38,230
I had to make sure.

1207
01:04:38,470 --> 01:04:40,550
I was like, wait, is this the right one?

1208
01:04:41,030 --> 01:04:42,630
It's been so long.

1209
01:04:43,370 --> 01:04:45,170
I don't remember.

1210
01:04:45,170 --> 01:04:45,450
I don't remember.

1211
01:04:45,690 --> 01:04:48,070
Where the fuck is it?

1212
01:04:48,710 --> 01:04:50,670
Okay, hockey name.

1213
01:04:50,850 --> 01:04:51,570
Oh, is it this?

1214
01:04:52,350 --> 01:04:53,170
There we go.

1215
01:04:54,490 --> 01:04:55,690
It's been so long.

1216
01:04:56,010 --> 01:04:57,330
We're actually...

1217
01:04:58,030 --> 01:04:59,770
I'm fucking huge.

1218
01:05:04,410 --> 01:05:05,490
Okay, wait.

1219
01:05:06,270 --> 01:05:06,610
Wait.

1220
01:05:07,690 --> 01:05:09,050
Okay, there we go.

1221
01:05:09,190 --> 01:05:10,470
Now that should work.

1222
01:05:10,470 --> 01:05:11,050
Okay.

1223
01:05:11,890 --> 01:05:12,830
Oh, fuck.

1224
01:05:12,890 --> 01:05:14,710
I'll fix this later because I'm in-game now.

1225
01:05:18,750 --> 01:05:21,310
Now we're actually back.

1226
01:05:22,250 --> 01:05:23,050
Oh, man.

1227
01:05:23,150 --> 01:05:25,030
Back when Mozambique was fucking terrible.

1228
01:05:27,390 --> 01:05:27,950
Please.

1229
01:05:28,910 --> 01:05:29,430
Thank you.

1230
01:05:29,730 --> 01:05:30,690
Oh, thank God.

1231
01:05:33,130 --> 01:05:34,270
Oh, my God.

1232
01:05:36,710 --> 01:05:38,210
Oh, my God.

1233
01:05:38,210 --> 01:05:39,710
There's way too many people.

1234
01:05:42,730 --> 01:05:44,410
There's way too many...

1235
01:05:44,410 --> 01:05:49,090
Oh, the fucking charge for this is fucking with me a lot right now.

1236
01:05:50,450 --> 01:05:51,430
Oh, my God.

1237
01:05:52,390 --> 01:05:54,150
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1238
01:05:55,030 --> 01:05:56,030
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1239
01:05:56,110 --> 01:05:56,750
I'll block this.

1240
01:05:56,770 --> 01:05:57,550
I'll block this door.

1241
01:05:57,670 --> 01:05:58,990
You go handle the other one.

1242
01:06:00,370 --> 01:06:00,850
What?

1243
01:06:00,970 --> 01:06:01,350
How?

1244
01:06:04,470 --> 01:06:04,950
No!

1245
01:06:05,090 --> 01:06:05,890
There's too many!

1246
01:06:05,890 --> 01:06:07,530
Okay, now I can fix myself.

1247
01:06:07,690 --> 01:06:08,450
Give me a sec.

1248
01:06:11,670 --> 01:06:12,910
Fix myself.

1249
01:06:13,430 --> 01:06:15,870
Okay, now we're okay.

1250
01:06:16,450 --> 01:06:17,970
Now we're okay.

1251
01:06:18,610 --> 01:06:20,730
Now we're back for real.

1252
01:06:21,050 --> 01:06:21,930
Okay, give me a sec.

1253
01:06:23,810 --> 01:06:24,150
Now...

1254
01:06:25,010 --> 01:06:27,970
Now we're back for real.

1255
01:06:29,590 --> 01:06:31,070
It's retro mode.

1256
01:06:31,270 --> 01:06:32,750
We're back in retro hours.

1257
01:06:32,750 --> 01:06:33,430
Oh, wait.

1258
01:06:34,490 --> 01:06:36,410
Hello, hello, everybody.

1259
01:06:36,890 --> 01:06:39,350
Now we're actually back in retro hours.

1260
01:06:42,770 --> 01:06:44,150
Oh, my God.

1261
01:06:46,970 --> 01:06:48,870
Not the boys.

1262
01:06:49,790 --> 01:06:50,850
What do you guys mean?

1263
01:06:51,630 --> 01:06:52,770
We're time traveling.

1264
01:06:52,990 --> 01:06:54,350
We're back in season one.

1265
01:06:57,830 --> 01:07:00,950
Yeah, this is retro Doki.

1266
01:07:00,950 --> 01:07:03,350
Back in season one Apex Legends.

1267
01:07:03,570 --> 01:07:04,970
Are you guys ready to game?

1268
01:07:07,930 --> 01:07:09,090
Not that.

1269
01:07:09,350 --> 01:07:10,190
What do you mean?

1270
01:07:11,150 --> 01:07:13,430
Am I back in 2021?

1271
01:07:15,470 --> 01:07:19,630
Spark Knights, are you guys ready for some more Apex Legends, Spark Knights?

1272
01:07:25,470 --> 01:07:27,930
Doki before she saw the real world.

1273
01:07:30,950 --> 01:07:32,470
Spark Knights, assemble!

1274
01:07:34,090 --> 01:07:35,390
That's right!

1275
01:07:35,670 --> 01:07:37,690
Can we get some Spark Knights in chat real quick?

1276
01:07:38,110 --> 01:07:41,250
Can we get some Spark Knights in chat?

1277
01:07:43,490 --> 01:07:46,130
Doki before the dark times.

1278
01:07:46,330 --> 01:07:49,430
Before the empire.

1279
01:07:50,970 --> 01:07:53,190
Time for the daily song.

1280
01:07:53,190 --> 01:07:58,750
Time for the daily song.

1281
01:07:58,770 --> 01:08:01,670
Alright, here we go.

1282
01:08:03,710 --> 01:08:07,050
We can have a good game, right?

1283
01:08:08,970 --> 01:08:10,230
Thank you for the super chat.

1284
01:08:10,690 --> 01:08:12,070
Thank you for the donation.

1285
01:08:12,250 --> 01:08:13,050
Thank you.

1286
01:08:13,090 --> 01:08:14,190
Here's a butthurt.

1287
01:08:17,250 --> 01:08:19,150
Redeeming the daily song.

1288
01:08:19,410 --> 01:08:20,890
I think I'm lost.

1289
01:08:20,890 --> 01:08:23,350
Mochi, thank you for the super chat.

1290
01:08:23,750 --> 01:08:25,710
Only OGs remember the butthurt.

1291
01:08:25,870 --> 01:08:28,230
Only OGs remember.

1292
01:08:28,910 --> 01:08:30,130
Oh wait, did I zoom in?

1293
01:08:30,290 --> 01:08:32,390
God damn it, I forgot to turn it off.

1294
01:08:32,710 --> 01:08:34,390
Okay, that was my bad, sorry.

1295
01:08:34,930 --> 01:08:36,970
Guys, I'm gonna ruin your immersion real quick.

1296
01:08:37,430 --> 01:08:39,050
Guys, I need to ruin your immersion.

1297
01:08:39,250 --> 01:08:40,270
Because I fucked up.

1298
01:08:40,630 --> 01:08:41,490
I fucked up.

1299
01:08:42,890 --> 01:08:45,710
I forgot to turn that off.

1300
01:08:47,650 --> 01:08:50,270
That's classic Doki right there.

1301
01:08:50,890 --> 01:08:51,290
Right there.

1302
01:08:53,870 --> 01:08:55,330
Alright, where are we going?

1303
01:08:57,170 --> 01:08:58,270
Where are we going?

1304
01:08:58,650 --> 01:09:00,490
My immersion!

1305
01:09:02,430 --> 01:09:05,050
Guys, Retro Doki did not care about the immersion.

1306
01:09:07,890 --> 01:09:09,750
Classic Retro stuff.

1307
01:09:10,370 --> 01:09:13,830
Just so you guys know, Retro Doki did not give a fuck.

1308
01:09:17,050 --> 01:09:19,590
Retro Doki was just trying to do her best.

1309
01:09:20,890 --> 01:09:23,050
Oh my god!

1310
01:09:23,770 --> 01:09:25,150
It's over.

1311
01:09:26,290 --> 01:09:28,890
It's over, but like...

1312
01:09:30,670 --> 01:09:33,110
It's so over.

1313
01:09:39,050 --> 01:09:40,370
Yes!

1314
01:09:44,610 --> 01:09:46,390
Retro Doki is happy.

1315
01:09:48,290 --> 01:09:50,350
Retro Doki is so happy.

1316
01:09:50,850 --> 01:09:52,270
Where the fuck is he?

1317
01:09:56,970 --> 01:09:58,090
Oh, there you are.

1318
01:09:58,150 --> 01:09:59,010
I see you.

1319
01:09:59,450 --> 01:10:01,410
I fucking see you.

1320
01:10:04,650 --> 01:10:05,110
Hey.

1321
01:10:09,250 --> 01:10:09,810
Nice.

1322
01:10:10,170 --> 01:10:11,110
Wait, give me a sec.

1323
01:10:11,170 --> 01:10:12,370
I need to fix myself.

1324
01:10:13,270 --> 01:10:15,250
Retro Doki is going through a lot right now.

1325
01:10:17,290 --> 01:10:19,490
I keep fucking it up.

1326
01:10:19,570 --> 01:10:20,590
I keep fucking it up.

1327
01:10:20,590 --> 01:10:21,270
I keep zooming in.

1328
01:10:21,630 --> 01:10:23,350
Give me a sec.

1329
01:10:23,770 --> 01:10:25,730
I keep accidentally zooming in.

1330
01:10:25,850 --> 01:10:26,870
I need to turn that off.

1331
01:10:29,470 --> 01:10:30,110
Alright.

1332
01:10:30,750 --> 01:10:33,550
Now, we're actually ready.

1333
01:10:33,790 --> 01:10:34,410
Oh my god.

1334
01:10:34,490 --> 01:10:37,210
Guys, I got my R9.

1335
01:10:37,530 --> 01:10:38,430
It's over.

1336
01:10:38,970 --> 01:10:39,430
It's over.

1337
01:10:40,990 --> 01:10:43,310
I got the R9 Peacekeeper.

1338
01:10:43,890 --> 01:10:44,930
Oh my god.

1339
01:10:44,950 --> 01:10:46,630
If I didn't have the collab, I would play longer.

1340
01:10:46,770 --> 01:10:48,750
I would definitely play so much more.

1341
01:10:52,190 --> 01:10:53,370
Maybe Gorilla Stream?

1342
01:10:53,490 --> 01:10:54,010
Who knows?

1343
01:10:54,130 --> 01:10:54,610
I don't know.

1344
01:10:54,670 --> 01:10:55,870
It just feels so fun.

1345
01:10:56,850 --> 01:10:58,210
I don't know.

1346
01:10:59,170 --> 01:11:01,850
Playing Classic Apex Season 1.

1347
01:11:02,710 --> 01:11:03,750
It's just...

1348
01:11:03,750 --> 01:11:05,510
It's nostalgia bait.

1349
01:11:05,630 --> 01:11:07,170
But by god, it's working.

1350
01:11:09,110 --> 01:11:10,350
It's working on me.

1351
01:11:10,350 --> 01:11:12,210
They know what I want.

1352
01:11:13,290 --> 01:11:15,490
This was literally made for me.

1353
01:11:15,550 --> 01:11:16,430
This is...

1354
01:11:17,910 --> 01:11:18,950
This is...

1355
01:11:18,950 --> 01:11:21,770
This is literally made for me.

1356
01:11:21,850 --> 01:11:23,770
I was the target audience for this.

1357
01:11:26,350 --> 01:11:28,990
Back when I played 8 plus hours everyday.

1358
01:11:29,590 --> 01:11:31,510
It feels just like home.

1359
01:11:32,110 --> 01:11:34,350
I was very depressed, but like...

1360
01:11:35,470 --> 01:11:36,670
Nothing's changed.

1361
01:11:38,290 --> 01:11:39,290
Nothing's changed.

1362
01:11:41,930 --> 01:11:42,430
Alright.

1363
01:11:44,890 --> 01:11:45,390
Nice.

1364
01:11:49,010 --> 01:11:53,970
I haven't been able to do bunnyhop healing because fights that go by so fucking fast.

1365
01:11:55,990 --> 01:11:56,490
Alright.

1366
01:11:56,970 --> 01:11:58,370
Let me grab this.

1367
01:11:58,730 --> 01:11:59,570
I need a 401.

1368
01:12:00,750 --> 01:12:01,630
Oh my god.

1369
01:12:01,690 --> 01:12:02,300
I need an R401.

1370
01:12:02,810 --> 01:12:05,530
I need to get a 301 so I get an R40400.

1371
01:12:07,150 --> 01:12:08,550
What are you talking about?

1372
01:12:08,630 --> 01:12:09,310
There's no dad.

1373
01:12:09,430 --> 01:12:11,370
It was just Doki Doge.

1374
01:12:13,870 --> 01:12:15,970
What are you talking about?

1375
01:12:16,050 --> 01:12:17,090
There was no dad.

1376
01:12:17,570 --> 01:12:19,250
It's the Barkknights Dragoons.

1377
01:12:19,390 --> 01:12:20,510
Who are the Dragoons?

1378
01:12:22,130 --> 01:12:24,230
Who are the Dragoons, guys?

1379
01:12:24,530 --> 01:12:25,690
It's the Barkknights.

1380
01:12:30,590 --> 01:12:32,390
Pre-dad era.

1381
01:12:33,350 --> 01:12:34,470
Who's dad?

1382
01:12:34,470 --> 01:12:36,610
There's only Doki...

1383
01:12:36,610 --> 01:12:37,450
I'm sorry.

1384
01:12:37,690 --> 01:12:38,950
There's only Doki Doge.

1385
01:12:38,950 --> 01:12:39,650
Who's dad?

1386
01:12:40,710 --> 01:12:42,170
Barkknights, are you guys okay?

1387
01:12:43,270 --> 01:12:45,710
I don't know why you're talking about... Oh my god.

1388
01:12:46,190 --> 01:12:47,690
Six shield cells.

1389
01:12:50,050 --> 01:12:51,990
Six shield cells.

1390
01:12:54,110 --> 01:12:55,910
What are you talking about?

1391
01:12:56,510 --> 01:12:58,710
I'm Doki Maplebird.

1392
01:13:04,470 --> 01:13:05,190
Overwatch 2?

1393
01:13:05,430 --> 01:13:07,070
That sounds crazy.

1394
01:13:07,550 --> 01:13:09,930
That sounds crazy.

1395
01:13:10,470 --> 01:13:12,670
They'll never make an Overwatch 2, guys.

1396
01:13:13,210 --> 01:13:13,850
Oh my god.

1397
01:13:13,870 --> 01:13:15,270
Did you guys hear about that?

1398
01:13:15,590 --> 01:13:15,810
Whoa!

1399
01:13:17,490 --> 01:13:18,090
Whoa!

1400
01:13:18,730 --> 01:13:19,470
Oh, they heard.

1401
01:13:20,030 --> 01:13:21,410
They definitely heard, though.

1402
01:13:21,810 --> 01:13:24,030
They heard.

1403
01:13:24,290 --> 01:13:26,470
They heard whatever I was...

1404
01:13:29,030 --> 01:13:31,790
As if they'll... Yeah, as if they'll make an Overwatch 2.

1405
01:13:31,790 --> 01:13:35,810
They gotta fix goats first before they make Overwatch 2.

1406
01:13:35,950 --> 01:13:37,570
Are you serious?

1407
01:13:37,970 --> 01:13:39,090
Another squad?

1408
01:13:40,310 --> 01:13:40,610
Okay.

1409
01:13:41,350 --> 01:13:42,650
Got it.

1410
01:13:43,390 --> 01:13:43,690
Okay.

1411
01:13:44,750 --> 01:13:46,210
Alright, here we go.

1412
01:13:50,850 --> 01:13:52,170
Yeah, there's...

1413
01:13:52,170 --> 01:13:52,510
Yeah.

1414
01:13:57,600 --> 01:13:58,820
Oh, nice.

1415
01:14:07,470 --> 01:14:08,270
Nice.

1416
01:14:10,370 --> 01:14:11,810
I hope that's ours.

1417
01:14:11,810 --> 01:14:14,050
I actually...

1418
01:14:14,050 --> 01:14:14,830
Oh, no.

1419
01:14:16,890 --> 01:14:18,650
Oh, that's fine.

1420
01:14:21,790 --> 01:14:22,430
Okay.

1421
01:14:23,850 --> 01:14:24,490
Nice.

1422
01:14:26,010 --> 01:14:27,470
Oh, there's another team.

1423
01:14:29,590 --> 01:14:30,390
Let's go in.

1424
01:14:31,590 --> 01:14:33,450
I think that's gonna happen to us.

1425
01:14:33,950 --> 01:14:35,210
I have a portal.

1426
01:14:35,950 --> 01:14:37,310
I don't remember old portal.

1427
01:14:37,410 --> 01:14:38,690
I just remember portal was cool.

1428
01:14:41,910 --> 01:14:43,910
Whoa, what the...

1429
01:14:43,910 --> 01:14:44,690
Okay, nice.

1430
01:14:44,770 --> 01:14:45,650
We got the lifeline.

1431
01:14:49,070 --> 01:14:50,350
Third party?

1432
01:14:53,510 --> 01:14:54,770
That's fucking right.

1433
01:14:55,390 --> 01:14:57,470
This is old R9, bitch!

1434
01:14:59,770 --> 01:15:01,290
This is the old R9!

1435
01:15:01,490 --> 01:15:02,790
You're in my world!

1436
01:15:04,170 --> 01:15:05,830
You're in my world!

1437
01:15:05,990 --> 01:15:06,270
No!

1438
01:15:06,590 --> 01:15:07,450
Don't fuck... Oh, god.

1439
01:15:07,530 --> 01:15:08,150
I'm lagging.

1440
01:15:11,810 --> 01:15:13,250
That's fucking right!

1441
01:15:13,850 --> 01:15:15,250
Welcome to my world!

1442
01:15:20,110 --> 01:15:20,950
Alright.

1443
01:15:21,790 --> 01:15:22,230
Nice.

1444
01:15:22,690 --> 01:15:23,930
That felt good.

1445
01:15:24,650 --> 01:15:27,450
I swear I heard a Wraith queue somewhere.

1446
01:15:28,370 --> 01:15:29,830
Where is that Wraith?

1447
01:15:29,890 --> 01:15:30,930
I know you're around.

1448
01:15:32,770 --> 01:15:36,150
I swear there was a Wraith queue.

1449
01:15:37,450 --> 01:15:39,150
Just like old times.

1450
01:15:39,150 --> 01:15:40,950
Just like old times.

1451
01:15:43,350 --> 01:15:44,770
Pastuki, I don't have much time.

1452
01:15:44,810 --> 01:15:45,770
I'm at 21 dollars.

1453
01:15:46,970 --> 01:15:47,470
What?

1454
01:15:47,630 --> 01:15:48,190
Don't what?

1455
01:15:48,390 --> 01:15:50,310
What is it?

1456
01:15:50,370 --> 01:15:52,770
What should I not do?

1457
01:15:53,970 --> 01:15:54,830
Hey, guys.

1458
01:15:55,190 --> 01:15:55,690
Oh, my god.

1459
01:15:55,710 --> 01:15:59,470
Did you guys saw the new Hololive EN debut?

1460
01:16:00,370 --> 01:16:04,570
Oh, my god.

1461
01:16:05,770 --> 01:16:08,730
I just watched your debut last week.

1462
01:16:08,870 --> 01:16:09,610
You're so cool.

1463
01:16:11,350 --> 01:16:13,010
Oh, my god.

1464
01:16:14,750 --> 01:16:15,470
Oh,

1465
01:16:31,270 --> 01:16:32,210
my god.

1466
01:16:32,270 --> 01:16:35,650
That shark girl when she started her stream with Ah.

1467
01:16:35,910 --> 01:16:36,770
Oh, my god.

1468
01:16:36,850 --> 01:16:37,890
That's crazy.

1469
01:16:38,830 --> 01:16:41,350
Hololive EN has an EN brand.

1470
01:16:41,590 --> 01:16:43,430
They literally just debuted last week.

1471
01:16:43,530 --> 01:16:44,470
It was so cool.

1472
01:16:45,910 --> 01:16:46,510
Um...

1473
01:16:49,250 --> 01:16:49,850
Um...

1474
01:16:49,850 --> 01:16:51,430
No, Doki, no!

1475
01:16:55,650 --> 01:16:56,950
Oh, my god.

1476
01:16:57,190 --> 01:16:58,050
It's really cool.

1477
01:16:58,230 --> 01:17:04,710
I never expected there gonna be like an actual like English branch for like... Oh, my god.

1478
01:17:05,050 --> 01:17:05,290
Wait.

1479
01:17:07,090 --> 01:17:08,970
Back to the good old days.

1480
01:17:14,230 --> 01:17:14,790
Alright.

1481
01:17:15,950 --> 01:17:16,470
Guys.

1482
01:17:16,630 --> 01:17:17,290
Oh, my god.

1483
01:17:17,750 --> 01:17:18,990
Do you guys think like...

1484
01:17:18,990 --> 01:17:22,450
Do you guys think VTubing is gonna like grow bigger?

1485
01:17:26,030 --> 01:17:26,590
Cool.

1486
01:17:29,650 --> 01:17:30,090
Cool.

1487
01:17:30,250 --> 01:17:31,070
Maple, no!

1488
01:17:33,930 --> 01:17:35,030
It's a canon event.

1489
01:17:35,150 --> 01:17:36,350
You can't stop it, guys.

1490
01:17:37,110 --> 01:17:38,110
It's too late.

1491
01:17:38,450 --> 01:17:39,710
It's a canon event.

1492
01:17:41,350 --> 01:17:42,230
Oh, my god.

1493
01:17:42,410 --> 01:17:43,450
Me and my 10 viewers.

1494
01:17:44,650 --> 01:17:45,530
Thanks, Sparkknights.

1495
01:17:45,610 --> 01:17:48,150
I really appreciate you guys coming in to watch me.

1496
01:17:48,650 --> 01:17:49,950
Me and my 10 viewers.

1497
01:17:50,770 --> 01:17:51,170
Oh, my god.

1498
01:17:51,210 --> 01:17:52,510
Thank you for the subscription.

1499
01:17:52,910 --> 01:17:53,970
Thank you for subscribing.

1500
01:17:54,090 --> 01:17:55,110
Have a good heart.

1501
01:17:58,190 --> 01:18:03,270
What do we do?

1502
01:18:03,830 --> 01:18:04,410
Oh, my gosh.

1503
01:18:04,510 --> 01:18:05,730
I can't believe our Bangalore...

1504
01:18:05,730 --> 01:18:06,230
Wait.

1505
01:18:06,330 --> 01:18:07,110
What is that?

1506
01:18:07,170 --> 01:18:08,630
What is that heirloom?

1507
01:18:09,590 --> 01:18:11,210
Bangalore doesn't have an heirloom.

1508
01:18:11,290 --> 01:18:12,990
Where did he get... Is he a hacker, guys?

1509
01:18:13,390 --> 01:18:14,850
How did he have that heirloom?

1510
01:18:18,590 --> 01:18:22,590
They've only just released the Wraith heirloom like...

1511
01:18:22,590 --> 01:18:23,290
Last month.

1512
01:18:23,450 --> 01:18:24,950
Like, how does he have an heirloom?

1513
01:18:25,270 --> 01:18:28,030
And why is it like a giant version of the Kunai?

1514
01:18:28,550 --> 01:18:29,430
He must be a dev.

1515
01:18:29,530 --> 01:18:29,930
You're right.

1516
01:18:30,230 --> 01:18:31,270
It must be a...

1517
01:18:33,730 --> 01:18:34,730
He's hacking.

1518
01:18:35,530 --> 01:18:36,290
Oh, my god.

1519
01:18:36,350 --> 01:18:38,190
He has a giant knife.

1520
01:18:38,490 --> 01:18:39,730
That doesn't exist.

1521
01:18:40,870 --> 01:18:42,530
Maybe he's a dev.

1522
01:18:43,050 --> 01:18:45,890
Redeeming for the song of the day.

1523
01:18:46,670 --> 01:18:48,570
Oh, shit.

1524
01:18:49,330 --> 01:18:49,830
Don't worry.

1525
01:18:49,890 --> 01:18:52,290
I have a 2x4 on my R9.

1526
01:18:52,490 --> 01:18:53,370
I'm so cursed.

1527
01:18:53,770 --> 01:18:56,190
I forgot how fucking cursed that shit was.

1528
01:19:04,730 --> 01:19:06,890
You're in my territory.

1529
01:19:07,610 --> 01:19:13,150
You're in my world.

1530
01:19:21,510 --> 01:19:22,490
GR9!

1531
01:19:23,250 --> 01:19:26,390
Now you guys know how I got top 500.

1532
01:19:26,870 --> 01:19:28,210
Now you know.

1533
01:19:31,010 --> 01:19:32,570
What the fuck?

1534
01:19:40,340 --> 01:19:40,740
Okay.

1535
01:19:45,080 --> 01:19:46,060
Alright.

1536
01:19:46,940 --> 01:19:47,920
Okay.

1537
01:19:56,570 --> 01:19:56,910
Where?

1538
01:19:56,910 --> 01:19:57,510
Okay.

1539
01:19:59,830 --> 01:20:01,390
Where the fuck is he?

1540
01:20:02,750 --> 01:20:04,270
Where did he go?

1541
01:20:06,690 --> 01:20:09,230
Where the fuck did he go?

1542
01:20:10,330 --> 01:20:11,950
Wait, I need the 2x4, actually.

1543
01:20:16,450 --> 01:20:17,790
Where was that rez?

1544
01:20:19,730 --> 01:20:21,150
Oh, it's above us.

1545
01:20:21,210 --> 01:20:21,910
Okay, let's go.

1546
01:20:26,150 --> 01:20:27,090
Let's see.

1547
01:20:27,090 --> 01:20:27,170
Let's see.

1548
01:20:29,090 --> 01:20:31,890
Should I get the- I feel like- Ah, fuck it.

1549
01:20:31,950 --> 01:20:32,530
Let's do it.

1550
01:20:32,890 --> 01:20:33,570
Let's full commit.

1551
01:20:34,070 --> 01:20:35,390
Let's actually bring it back.

1552
01:20:36,470 --> 01:20:38,150
Let's bring it back.

1553
01:20:40,490 --> 01:20:41,170
There we go.

1554
01:20:48,790 --> 01:20:49,650
Oh, man.

1555
01:20:49,850 --> 01:20:50,530
Poor guys.

1556
01:20:52,250 --> 01:20:53,530
Where's that Bangalore?

1557
01:20:53,590 --> 01:20:54,430
I know you're here.

1558
01:20:55,070 --> 01:20:57,370
I know you're here, Bangalore.

1559
01:20:58,390 --> 01:20:59,670
Where are you?

1560
01:20:59,670 --> 01:21:00,090
I don't know.

1561
01:21:00,730 --> 01:21:01,410
Huh?

1562
01:21:03,330 --> 01:21:04,010
What?

1563
01:21:05,350 --> 01:21:06,030
Bangalore?

1564
01:21:07,490 --> 01:21:09,090
Bangalore, where did you go?

1565
01:21:10,010 --> 01:21:10,970
Little guy!

1566
01:21:12,230 --> 01:21:13,950
Where did the little guy go?

1567
01:21:14,010 --> 01:21:14,630
Oh, fuck it.

1568
01:21:14,990 --> 01:21:16,930
The little guy can't do anything anyway.

1569
01:21:17,490 --> 01:21:18,690
Might as well leave.

1570
01:21:21,470 --> 01:21:23,450
That little guy can't do shit.

1571
01:21:24,550 --> 01:21:25,910
Goodbye, little guy.

1572
01:21:28,050 --> 01:21:29,550
Goodbye, little guy.

1573
01:21:29,550 --> 01:21:32,730
Look, I got my Pred badge right here.

1574
01:21:33,090 --> 01:21:33,710
Wait.

1575
01:21:34,850 --> 01:21:36,730
Got my Pred thing here.

1576
01:21:37,050 --> 01:21:38,870
And I got my Pred right here.

1577
01:21:42,270 --> 01:21:42,990
Yeah.

1578
01:21:43,790 --> 01:21:44,510
Yeah.

1579
01:21:46,470 --> 01:21:47,790
That's so cute, right?

1580
01:21:49,630 --> 01:21:50,790
That's how it happened.

1581
01:21:52,310 --> 01:21:53,710
Got OGR9.

1582
01:21:53,890 --> 01:21:56,450
Forgot how fucking broken OGR9 was.

1583
01:21:56,870 --> 01:21:58,150
Holy shit.

1584
01:21:58,250 --> 01:21:59,670
That guy got fucking shredded.

1585
01:21:59,850 --> 01:22:00,890
And I had a 2x4.

1586
01:22:01,270 --> 01:22:04,550
I had a fucking 2x4 scope.

1587
01:22:05,470 --> 01:22:06,810
That should not have worked.

1588
01:22:07,310 --> 01:22:10,170
That actually should not have worked.

1589
01:22:11,650 --> 01:22:12,210
Hello?

1590
01:22:14,190 --> 01:22:14,890
Hello?

1591
01:22:15,270 --> 01:22:16,190
Where are you guys?

1592
01:22:16,810 --> 01:22:18,210
I know one of you is a solo.

1593
01:22:18,210 --> 01:22:20,490
And the other one has to be...

1594
01:22:20,490 --> 01:22:22,190
I guess the other team has to be a full team.

1595
01:22:22,290 --> 01:22:24,210
There's no way it's like two...

1596
01:22:24,910 --> 01:22:25,950
There's no way.

1597
01:22:27,650 --> 01:22:28,550
Oh my god.

1598
01:22:28,630 --> 01:22:30,770
Hunting in this map is so difficult.

1599
01:22:31,650 --> 01:22:34,570
I don't remember what the pathways were in Season 1.

1600
01:22:36,590 --> 01:22:37,690
Oh, they're up here?

1601
01:22:39,310 --> 01:22:40,350
They're up here?

1602
01:22:42,010 --> 01:22:43,170
Oh, they are.

1603
01:22:45,050 --> 01:22:45,770
They are.

1604
01:22:45,770 --> 01:22:47,070
Oh my god, look at him go.

1605
01:22:47,550 --> 01:22:49,290
He's infinitely jumping.

1606
01:22:50,750 --> 01:22:51,690
Oh fuck.

1607
01:22:51,790 --> 01:22:52,190
Okay, don't.

1608
01:22:54,310 --> 01:22:55,390
Don't watch.

1609
01:22:55,870 --> 01:22:59,870
Don't watch that.

1610
01:23:00,390 --> 01:23:02,150
Don't watch that.

1611
01:23:05,690 --> 01:23:07,110
Don't watch that.

1612
01:23:07,170 --> 01:23:07,990
That was an accident.

1613
01:23:09,670 --> 01:23:12,030
That was an accident, guys.

1614
01:23:12,610 --> 01:23:14,430
It was just a prank.

1615
01:23:14,430 --> 01:23:17,470
Oh, it was just a prank, guys.

1616
01:23:18,770 --> 01:23:20,730
Guys, it's cause I have a 2x4.

1617
01:23:20,810 --> 01:23:22,030
I'm more used to 3x.

1618
01:23:22,470 --> 01:23:24,950
Guys, it's cause I needed a 3x, guys.

1619
01:23:25,590 --> 01:23:26,490
Wait, what?

1620
01:23:27,090 --> 01:23:28,370
Oh my god.

1621
01:23:29,710 --> 01:23:31,090
Fucking wingman though.

1622
01:23:32,810 --> 01:23:33,290
Alright.

1623
01:23:33,850 --> 01:23:35,070
How far are they?

1624
01:23:35,650 --> 01:23:37,210
Okay, I need high ground on this.

1625
01:23:38,310 --> 01:23:39,850
I was just being silly.

1626
01:23:39,990 --> 01:23:41,410
I was just being silly, guys.

1627
01:23:41,410 --> 01:23:42,250
Wait.

1628
01:23:43,570 --> 01:23:44,310
There we go.

1629
01:23:44,930 --> 01:23:45,870
No more being silly.

1630
01:23:46,430 --> 01:23:49,710
No more being silly, guys.

1631
01:23:50,290 --> 01:23:51,410
Oh my god.

1632
01:23:51,450 --> 01:23:52,730
He was actually one though.

1633
01:23:54,510 --> 01:23:56,510
No more being silly for real.

1634
01:24:00,110 --> 01:24:01,770
Not being silly anymore.

1635
01:24:08,410 --> 01:24:09,650
More being silly.

1636
01:24:12,570 --> 01:24:13,790
No more being silly.

1637
01:24:15,070 --> 01:24:16,970
No more.

1638
01:24:18,730 --> 01:24:20,470
Silliness is over.

1639
01:24:20,950 --> 01:24:23,430
Silliness is over.

1640
01:24:26,050 --> 01:24:27,070
Silliness is over.

1641
01:24:27,070 --> 01:24:29,530
Rest in peace, those guys.

1642
01:24:29,750 --> 01:24:31,070
That's fucking right.

1643
01:24:31,750 --> 01:24:33,790
I'm no longer playing anymore.

1644
01:24:35,950 --> 01:24:37,690
I'm peak-doki with my R9.

1645
01:24:37,690 --> 01:24:38,890
I'm peak -doki with my R9.

1646
01:24:40,090 --> 01:24:40,730
Look at that!

1647
01:24:40,730 --> 01:24:41,990
The first time!

1648
01:24:42,110 --> 01:24:43,750
I find an R9!

1649
01:24:44,070 --> 01:24:45,490
The first time!

1650
01:24:46,790 --> 01:24:46,970
Oh.

1651
01:24:48,130 --> 01:24:48,690
I do?

1652
01:24:51,290 --> 01:24:52,330
Where?

1653
01:24:53,950 --> 01:24:55,010
I got...

1654
01:24:55,010 --> 01:24:58,130
I got looked at by the enemy though.

1655
01:25:05,080 --> 01:25:06,640
Where is it?

1656
01:25:07,640 --> 01:25:08,880
He's here somewhere.

1657
01:25:09,660 --> 01:25:11,280
He's scoped in.

1658
01:25:12,360 --> 01:25:13,580
He's here.

1659
01:25:16,620 --> 01:25:18,420
He's scoped.

1660
01:25:30,050 --> 01:25:31,910
But pretty eyes.

1661
01:25:37,970 --> 01:25:39,730
Fucking easy.

1662
01:25:40,690 --> 01:25:42,910
So fucking easy.

1663
01:25:43,570 --> 01:25:45,010
How did you see that?

1664
01:25:45,070 --> 01:25:45,910
I told you.

1665
01:25:46,990 --> 01:25:48,650
Got my R9.

1666
01:25:48,890 --> 01:25:52,230
Back to the good old days.

1667
01:25:52,490 --> 01:25:54,130
I'm back, baby.

1668
01:25:54,530 --> 01:25:56,020
I'm fucking back.

1669
01:25:58,590 --> 01:25:59,050
That's...

1670
01:26:00,590 --> 01:26:02,870
That's how I got top 500.

1671
01:26:03,410 --> 01:26:05,590
At least the bathroom chat.

1672
01:27:07,970 --> 01:27:08,430
Back.

1673
01:27:08,770 --> 01:27:10,030
I'm fucking back, guys.

1674
01:27:10,790 --> 01:27:12,650
I'm back in more ways than one right now.

1675
01:27:15,610 --> 01:27:16,570
Oh my god.

1676
01:27:17,010 --> 01:27:18,310
I'm sad that this is not in rank.

1677
01:27:18,390 --> 01:27:19,430
I wish they could bring that...

1678
01:27:19,430 --> 01:27:22,470
I wish they would bring it back just for rank.

1679
01:27:22,470 --> 01:27:25,550
If it was just for rank, it would be so fun.

1680
01:27:25,670 --> 01:27:32,590
I think it would be really fun to have OG Apex Season 1 back.

1681
01:27:33,910 --> 01:27:36,350
Just for fun.

1682
01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:42,960
Too bad.

1683
01:27:43,140 --> 01:27:43,980
Too bad we don't.

1684
01:27:45,540 --> 01:27:46,600
Yeah, they should!

1685
01:27:47,140 --> 01:27:48,800
I feel like they should make this mode.

1686
01:27:49,080 --> 01:27:51,320
If they can have arenas, why can't we have this?

1687
01:27:51,320 --> 01:27:54,720
If they make this stupid arenas...

1688
01:27:54,720 --> 01:27:56,740
I like how somebody was like, I want arena back.

1689
01:27:56,960 --> 01:28:02,580
And I was like, if they could have that stupid arena mode for rank, I would like this to be a rank mode too.

1690
01:28:11,370 --> 01:28:12,890
Just roll back everything.

1691
01:28:13,670 --> 01:28:14,510
Who cares?

1692
01:28:15,270 --> 01:28:16,690
This was more fun anyway.

1693
01:28:25,210 --> 01:28:26,030
I wish.

1694
01:28:26,030 --> 01:28:27,130
Aw man.

1695
01:28:27,510 --> 01:28:29,230
I do wish they would bring...

1696
01:28:29,230 --> 01:28:30,550
I wish this was a rank mode.

1697
01:28:30,730 --> 01:28:32,330
I think people would have so much fun.

1698
01:28:32,710 --> 01:28:33,850
Doing this for rank mode.

1699
01:28:34,570 --> 01:28:36,310
Especially with punch boosting.

1700
01:28:36,690 --> 01:28:38,890
Punch boosting and...

1701
01:28:39,450 --> 01:28:40,670
And bunny hopping.

1702
01:28:40,870 --> 01:28:42,590
It's like skill stuff are back.

1703
01:28:42,670 --> 01:28:45,670
It was more like PC related movement stuff too.

1704
01:28:46,310 --> 01:28:47,790
I feel like it would be so fun.

1705
01:28:47,790 --> 01:28:47,850
Oh man.

1706
01:28:50,530 --> 01:28:51,330
Catalyst!

1707
01:28:51,930 --> 01:28:52,930
Derpy Lake!

1708
01:28:53,610 --> 01:28:54,410
Oh yes.

1709
01:28:55,030 --> 01:28:56,190
It's time.

1710
01:28:56,910 --> 01:28:58,630
It's time.

1711
01:28:59,590 --> 01:29:01,950
Now to actually be annoying.

1712
01:29:03,250 --> 01:29:05,910
I need a sniper scope for this.

1713
01:29:06,510 --> 01:29:07,890
And then I can actually...

1714
01:29:07,890 --> 01:29:08,650
Terrorize.

1715
01:29:09,570 --> 01:29:10,930
Terrorize the lobby.

1716
01:29:13,570 --> 01:29:15,610
Alright, we need a sniper scope.

1717
01:29:15,610 --> 01:29:16,230
And it's over.

1718
01:29:17,270 --> 01:29:18,530
It's so over.

1719
01:29:20,810 --> 01:29:22,470
Alright, there's nothing here.

1720
01:29:22,950 --> 01:29:24,590
Oh yeah, there shouldn't be anything here.

1721
01:29:24,710 --> 01:29:26,310
It's apex 1 loot table.

1722
01:29:27,310 --> 01:29:28,530
I wish they didn't reverse that.

1723
01:29:28,810 --> 01:29:31,830
They shouldn't have...

1724
01:29:31,830 --> 01:29:33,390
They shouldn't have reversed it.

1725
01:29:33,950 --> 01:29:35,850
They know it was garbage.

1726
01:29:36,550 --> 01:29:37,150
It's like...

1727
01:29:37,150 --> 01:29:38,850
Everything but the loot.

1728
01:29:40,650 --> 01:29:42,730
I'm trying to find armor.

1729
01:29:43,530 --> 01:29:44,970
There's no armor.

1730
01:29:45,290 --> 01:29:45,970
There's no armor anywhere.

1731
01:29:46,750 --> 01:29:49,770
It looks like I fucking ran past like 20 armors.

1732
01:29:49,870 --> 01:29:50,470
I don't...

1733
01:29:50,470 --> 01:29:51,470
I haven't found...

1734
01:29:51,470 --> 01:29:54,350
But I don't want.

1735
01:29:57,130 --> 01:29:58,910
It's not fair.

1736
01:30:00,410 --> 01:30:02,690
I want to pick and choose.

1737
01:30:05,290 --> 01:30:05,970
Alright.

1738
01:30:07,470 --> 01:30:09,670
You have to get through the olyx.

1739
01:30:10,070 --> 01:30:10,850
You have to get through.

1740
01:30:10,850 --> 01:30:13,790
It's either all of them or none of them.

1741
01:30:14,010 --> 01:30:14,330
Doki.

1742
01:30:15,150 --> 01:30:15,730
Oh god.

1743
01:30:15,950 --> 01:30:17,830
Well, that was fast.

1744
01:30:18,470 --> 01:30:18,910
Wow.

1745
01:30:19,910 --> 01:30:21,990
Why are you taking the zip?

1746
01:30:22,390 --> 01:30:23,270
Are you stupid?

1747
01:30:24,090 --> 01:30:30,090
Oh my god, I have to stay here.

1748
01:30:32,230 --> 01:30:32,770
Okay.

1749
01:30:33,850 --> 01:30:35,330
There's an armor swap right here.

1750
01:30:35,410 --> 01:30:37,030
So I need to play around this area.

1751
01:30:37,990 --> 01:30:39,010
Where is he?

1752
01:30:39,650 --> 01:30:41,270
Wait, no, there's an armor swap right here.

1753
01:30:41,930 --> 01:30:43,230
As long as I play around...

1754
01:30:43,650 --> 01:30:45,910
Oh my god, there's 200 armor swaps.

1755
01:30:47,610 --> 01:30:49,850
I hear the octane.

1756
01:30:53,870 --> 01:30:55,690
Okay, I'm going to play around here.

1757
01:30:56,190 --> 01:30:57,050
For the armor swaps.

1758
01:31:00,050 --> 01:31:01,450
Oh my god.

1759
01:31:01,610 --> 01:31:02,510
Where are they?

1760
01:31:06,440 --> 01:31:06,880
Okay.

1761
01:31:06,880 --> 01:31:06,920
Okay.

1762
01:31:08,920 --> 01:31:10,360
Are you serious?

1763
01:31:13,400 --> 01:31:15,100
I hear them, but like...

1764
01:31:21,710 --> 01:31:22,930
Haha, JK.

1765
01:31:39,020 --> 01:31:40,080
Oh my god.

1766
01:31:44,490 --> 01:31:46,010
Oh my god.

1767
01:31:46,250 --> 01:31:48,670
That was like 20 different armor swaps that I took.

1768
01:31:48,670 --> 01:31:49,390
Haha.

1769
01:31:53,150 --> 01:31:53,790
Okay.

1770
01:31:56,310 --> 01:31:58,870
That's like the only way to win that fight.

1771
01:31:59,330 --> 01:32:01,630
I just had to use the armor swaps.

1772
01:32:09,220 --> 01:32:12,520
Okay, I need to get this G7 scout.

1773
01:32:12,660 --> 01:32:14,200
I can't clutch with a G7 scout.

1774
01:32:18,970 --> 01:32:20,330
Alright, goodbye.

1775
01:32:24,130 --> 01:32:24,750
Mwah.

1776
01:32:26,150 --> 01:32:27,890
That's what I used to do.

1777
01:32:28,910 --> 01:32:31,750
Just stand there, 200 armor.

1778
01:32:32,110 --> 01:32:33,970
And then be like, swap, swap, swap.

1779
01:32:34,990 --> 01:32:36,850
It was how you came.

1780
01:32:38,330 --> 01:32:41,410
I still got it.

1781
01:32:41,850 --> 01:32:43,330
I still got it in me.

1782
01:32:44,290 --> 01:32:48,530
I still remember the strat.

1783
01:32:48,530 --> 01:32:49,110
Haha.

1784
01:32:50,770 --> 01:32:51,710
Yeah, exactly.

1785
01:32:51,870 --> 01:32:54,130
It's basically a purple armor, exactly.

1786
01:32:56,070 --> 01:32:58,250
Yeah, everything is like the original.

1787
01:32:59,870 --> 01:33:01,230
Okay, do I even have a helmet?

1788
01:33:01,370 --> 01:33:01,890
I do.

1789
01:33:07,120 --> 01:33:09,040
Okay, let me get my syringe up.

1790
01:33:09,520 --> 01:33:11,520
Just like how it should be played.

1791
01:33:12,460 --> 01:33:14,500
That was how it should have been played.

1792
01:33:14,620 --> 01:33:15,540
Guys, fuck, okay?

1793
01:33:15,540 --> 01:33:15,680
Okay.

1794
01:33:20,140 --> 01:33:22,220
That's fucking right, idiot.

1795
01:33:25,340 --> 01:33:26,420
Fucking stupid.

1796
01:33:26,640 --> 01:33:27,860
What are you, fucking stupid?

1797
01:33:30,240 --> 01:33:35,540
Oh my god.

1798
01:33:36,480 --> 01:33:38,820
Yeah, fucking get rezzed.

1799
01:33:39,980 --> 01:33:42,320
Rezz yourself and do it again.

1800
01:33:42,320 --> 01:33:44,360
I fucking dare you.

1801
01:33:45,100 --> 01:33:46,620
Peek me again, you whore.

1802
01:33:48,580 --> 01:33:49,260
Alright.

1803
01:33:49,840 --> 01:33:51,060
Get out of here.

1804
01:33:52,340 --> 01:33:54,060
Get out of here.

1805
01:33:55,260 --> 01:33:57,500
Oh, he is trying to peek me again.

1806
01:33:58,860 --> 01:34:00,640
Yeah, woah, woah, woah.

1807
01:34:00,840 --> 01:34:01,740
Fucking stupid.

1808
01:34:05,420 --> 01:34:07,020
Learn how to aim.

1809
01:34:07,020 --> 01:34:07,360
Thank you.

1810
01:34:10,740 --> 01:34:12,180
Alright, nice.

1811
01:34:14,240 --> 01:34:15,960
He had purple armor too.

1812
01:34:16,020 --> 01:34:17,440
He should not have lost that.

1813
01:34:17,780 --> 01:34:19,260
That's actually so embarrassing.

1814
01:34:21,540 --> 01:34:23,420
I mean, I could.

1815
01:34:24,880 --> 01:34:25,300
Okay.

1816
01:34:28,220 --> 01:34:29,560
Oh my god.

1817
01:34:30,260 --> 01:34:31,280
Maybe he is stupid.

1818
01:34:39,040 --> 01:34:39,680
Alright.

1819
01:34:39,920 --> 01:34:41,280
Here we go again.

1820
01:34:42,320 --> 01:34:43,900
Here we go again.

1821
01:34:45,580 --> 01:34:46,800
Let's go the other way.

1822
01:34:47,920 --> 01:34:49,300
Let's go the other way.

1823
01:34:49,620 --> 01:34:50,820
Bloodhound, what are you doing?

1824
01:34:51,540 --> 01:34:53,240
I'm clearly running away from you.

1825
01:34:57,640 --> 01:34:59,600
Bloodhound, I have zero heals.

1826
01:35:00,400 --> 01:35:01,300
Oh my god.

1827
01:35:02,400 --> 01:35:03,040
Bloodhound.

1828
01:35:03,840 --> 01:35:05,980
Oh my god, Bloodhound.

1829
01:35:07,500 --> 01:35:09,360
Oh my god.

1830
01:35:09,660 --> 01:35:11,940
Like, why did he run that way?

1831
01:35:12,040 --> 01:35:14,740
I don't have 500 white armor.

1832
01:35:15,140 --> 01:35:17,000
To do this trick again.

1833
01:35:17,720 --> 01:35:20,400
Like, I was in Skulltown.

1834
01:35:20,920 --> 01:35:23,680
You can only do this trick in Skulltown.

1835
01:35:27,530 --> 01:35:30,750
Literally, Skulltown is like the only place you can do the trick.

1836
01:35:30,850 --> 01:35:33,050
Because there is like 200 white armors there.

1837
01:35:34,490 --> 01:35:37,450
Oh, you guys are so dumb.

1838
01:35:39,930 --> 01:35:41,190
Oh my god.

1839
01:35:41,250 --> 01:35:41,350
Oh my god.

1840
01:35:41,350 --> 01:35:42,870
You guys are fucking stupid.

1841
01:35:44,750 --> 01:35:47,670
Oh, he would have been dead if I had a...

1842
01:35:49,950 --> 01:35:50,550
Um...

1843
01:35:58,840 --> 01:35:59,440
Fucking...

1844
01:35:59,440 --> 01:36:01,160
Like, stolen him again.

1845
01:36:05,780 --> 01:36:07,360
Oh my god.

1846
01:36:07,640 --> 01:36:08,860
Oh, and you're fucking rolling.

1847
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:09,860
Of course you are.

1848
01:36:10,180 --> 01:36:11,080
Get shit on.

1849
01:36:15,120 --> 01:36:16,060
Dumb teammates.

1850
01:36:16,060 --> 01:36:17,300
No, that never changes.

1851
01:36:17,400 --> 01:36:18,080
It's still the same.

1852
01:36:18,180 --> 01:36:19,580
It's always been like that, guys.

1853
01:36:19,900 --> 01:36:22,400
It's never changed.

1854
01:36:24,520 --> 01:36:27,240
Stupid teammates are still the same.

1855
01:36:34,700 --> 01:36:35,800
Sorry, guys.

1856
01:36:36,780 --> 01:36:37,620
It's okay.

1857
01:36:38,720 --> 01:36:40,180
I'm so happy that like...

1858
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:41,520
Um...

1859
01:36:41,520 --> 01:36:42,500
Oh my god, guys.

1860
01:36:42,500 --> 01:36:43,760
I can't believe Apex...

1861
01:36:43,760 --> 01:36:46,000
We're in season one of Apex, guys.

1862
01:36:46,160 --> 01:36:48,200
Do you think this game is gonna grow big, guys?

1863
01:36:48,960 --> 01:36:52,200
I know like I just came from Overwatch, but...

1864
01:36:52,200 --> 01:36:53,440
I think this game is getting...

1865
01:36:53,440 --> 01:36:54,820
Is really addicting so far.

1866
01:36:58,860 --> 01:36:59,900
I'm not sure yet.

1867
01:36:59,980 --> 01:37:01,000
I think like...

1868
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:01,960
Wraith is like...

1869
01:37:01,960 --> 01:37:03,180
Right now is my favorite.

1870
01:37:03,360 --> 01:37:07,520
I heard they're planning on making a competitive like esports team for Apex.

1871
01:37:07,600 --> 01:37:09,820
And like TSM is planning on signing a team soon.

1872
01:37:09,820 --> 01:37:11,140
I wonder who's gonna be in it.

1873
01:37:11,200 --> 01:37:12,720
Do you think Ace is gonna be in it?

1874
01:37:13,280 --> 01:37:16,480
Guys, did you hear about this kid named Dizzy?

1875
01:37:17,520 --> 01:37:19,360
He's so good with the wingman.

1876
01:37:19,420 --> 01:37:20,440
I've been watching Dizzy.

1877
01:37:21,240 --> 01:37:23,820
I've been watching Dizzy with his wingman.

1878
01:37:24,220 --> 01:37:26,600
And oh my god, he's so good.

1879
01:37:36,360 --> 01:37:39,900
I just hope they...

1880
01:37:39,900 --> 01:37:40,320
Wig?

1881
01:37:40,400 --> 01:37:41,580
Who's Nice Wig?

1882
01:37:41,920 --> 01:37:43,360
Never heard of that guy before.

1883
01:37:48,250 --> 01:37:49,360
Who's Nice Wig?

1884
01:37:54,100 --> 01:37:54,780
Who's Nice Wig?

1885
01:37:54,780 --> 01:37:55,700
No, too far back!

1886
01:37:55,860 --> 01:37:56,280
Go back!

1887
01:37:56,400 --> 01:37:56,940
Go back!

1888
01:38:00,200 --> 01:38:02,160
I've only heard of Dizzy.

1889
01:38:02,640 --> 01:38:05,260
I've been watching Dizzy and Ace.

1890
01:38:10,100 --> 01:38:11,840
Oh, what the fuck?

1891
01:38:12,520 --> 01:38:12,860
Whoa.

1892
01:38:16,850 --> 01:38:17,530
Okay.

1893
01:38:18,430 --> 01:38:21,250
Yeah, I've only heard of Ace and Dizzy.

1894
01:38:21,250 --> 01:38:23,390
Dizzy and his wingman.

1895
01:38:23,810 --> 01:38:26,750
He makes wingman look so easy.

1896
01:38:26,930 --> 01:38:29,610
I wish I could aim like that, honestly.

1897
01:38:32,990 --> 01:38:35,430
He has purple armor off rip?!

1898
01:38:38,300 --> 01:38:38,980
Hello.

1899
01:38:44,180 --> 01:38:45,480
That's fucked up.

1900
01:38:46,440 --> 01:38:48,900
I can't believe he had purple armor off rip.

1901
01:38:51,680 --> 01:38:53,560
I'm trying to figure out where he would go.

1902
01:38:57,240 --> 01:38:58,100
Wingman is stupid.

1903
01:39:01,500 --> 01:39:03,080
Wingman is stupid.

1904
01:39:03,800 --> 01:39:06,000
Oh, feels just like...

1905
01:39:07,080 --> 01:39:07,640
What the?

1906
01:39:08,220 --> 01:39:08,920
He whiffed it.

1907
01:39:09,740 --> 01:39:10,480
Where is he?

1908
01:39:11,840 --> 01:39:12,520
Stand here.

1909
01:39:12,680 --> 01:39:13,060
Stand here.

1910
01:39:13,180 --> 01:39:13,960
Put your shield up!

1911
01:39:14,040 --> 01:39:14,860
Oh, he doesn't have knockdown.

1912
01:39:18,020 --> 01:39:18,780
There's a Wraith.

1913
01:39:19,320 --> 01:39:20,540
Yeah, I see him.

1914
01:39:20,580 --> 01:39:21,080
I see him.

1915
01:39:21,120 --> 01:39:21,600
I see him.

1916
01:39:21,600 --> 01:39:22,740
Oh, he's...

1917
01:39:26,320 --> 01:39:28,000
How do you whiff that again?

1918
01:39:30,800 --> 01:39:32,400
He died!

1919
01:39:33,360 --> 01:39:34,160
Oh, shit!

1920
01:39:36,300 --> 01:39:37,400
It's okay.

1921
01:39:37,760 --> 01:39:38,760
We lived...

1922
01:39:38,760 --> 01:39:40,680
We lived past the...

1923
01:39:40,680 --> 01:39:41,400
It's okay.

1924
01:39:41,760 --> 01:39:45,880
We survived longer than the Pathfinder.

1925
01:39:46,360 --> 01:39:48,400
He fucking died for that.

1926
01:39:48,520 --> 01:39:49,360
Fuck that Pathfinder.

1927
01:39:49,480 --> 01:39:51,340
Bro, it felt like the...

1928
01:39:51,340 --> 01:39:52,440
I like how...

1929
01:39:52,440 --> 01:39:53,980
I like how he was like...

1930
01:39:53,980 --> 01:39:56,600
Wingman is so fucking...

1931
01:39:56,600 --> 01:39:58,520
Feels just like season 1.

1932
01:40:01,020 --> 01:40:02,200
Oh my god.

1933
01:40:02,500 --> 01:40:03,120
You know what?

1934
01:40:03,880 --> 01:40:07,020
I do hope they release Titanfall 3 after this though.

1935
01:40:07,220 --> 01:40:10,460
It's so cool that they made a Battle Royale off of Titanfall 2.

1936
01:40:10,820 --> 01:40:11,520
Oh my gosh.

1937
01:40:11,920 --> 01:40:15,340
I can't wait for them to focus on Titanfall 3 right after...

1938
01:40:16,080 --> 01:40:19,060
After releasing...

1939
01:40:19,060 --> 01:40:19,500
After...

1940
01:40:19,500 --> 01:40:21,320
No, Ducky, stop!

1941
01:40:22,700 --> 01:40:24,260
Don't you...

1942
01:40:24,260 --> 01:40:24,700
What?

1943
01:40:25,140 --> 01:40:26,180
What, guys?

1944
01:40:26,320 --> 01:40:27,080
It's only 2021.

1945
01:40:27,780 --> 01:40:28,600
What's going on?

1946
01:40:30,560 --> 01:40:31,360
No.

1947
01:40:32,080 --> 01:40:34,400
Why must you do this?

1948
01:40:35,940 --> 01:40:37,000
It's just 2021.

1949
01:40:37,480 --> 01:40:38,920
What's going on, Farknights?

1950
01:40:39,540 --> 01:40:40,560
What's going on?

1951
01:40:48,700 --> 01:40:52,860
If they can do this for their free Battle Royale...

1952
01:40:52,860 --> 01:40:53,640
Oh my gosh.

1953
01:40:53,720 --> 01:40:57,260
I can't wait to see what they're gonna do for it by Titanfall 3.

1954
01:40:59,060 --> 01:40:59,880
Oh my god.

1955
01:40:59,900 --> 01:41:01,940
Yeah, did you see this trailer for Silksong?

1956
01:41:03,620 --> 01:41:06,340
I heard it's coming out like next year.

1957
01:41:10,880 --> 01:41:13,120
Time showed no mercy.

1958
01:41:14,120 --> 01:41:15,000
Oh my god.

1959
01:41:15,080 --> 01:41:17,540
They were showing it at like E3.

1960
01:41:22,140 --> 01:41:23,020
No, stop!

1961
01:41:23,960 --> 01:41:24,920
Oh my god, I love E3.

1962
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:25,780
I hope we get another...

1963
01:41:25,780 --> 01:41:27,420
I hope we get E3 this year.

1964
01:41:30,380 --> 01:41:31,040
Oh my...

1965
01:41:31,040 --> 01:41:33,000
Are you guys excited for E3 this year?

1966
01:41:33,300 --> 01:41:34,400
I'm so excited.

1967
01:41:34,980 --> 01:41:36,700
I hope it doesn't get cancelled or anything.

1968
01:41:36,980 --> 01:41:38,700
And even if it does get cancelled...

1969
01:41:38,700 --> 01:41:40,300
I bet it's gonna come back next year.

1970
01:41:43,580 --> 01:41:44,020
Stop.

1971
01:41:44,020 --> 01:41:44,200
Stop.

1972
01:41:46,280 --> 01:41:48,540
I'll just come back next year, guys.

1973
01:41:50,240 --> 01:41:53,320
E3 is always here.

1974
01:41:57,390 --> 01:41:59,870
Doki, did you...

1975
01:41:59,870 --> 01:42:01,610
Are you okay, Doki?

1976
01:42:01,670 --> 01:42:02,310
Who hurt you?

1977
01:42:03,470 --> 01:42:04,150
Like...

1978
01:42:04,150 --> 01:42:05,390
That guy.

1979
01:42:06,370 --> 01:42:08,130
That guy hurt me.

1980
01:42:08,570 --> 01:42:09,750
I couldn't even...

1981
01:42:09,750 --> 01:42:13,290
Oh my god, I couldn't even run past...

1982
01:42:13,290 --> 01:42:15,550
Good old Apex.

1983
01:42:15,810 --> 01:42:17,570
Feels just like home.

1984
01:42:18,830 --> 01:42:21,170
Good old Skulltown.

1985
01:42:21,470 --> 01:42:23,130
Just like I never left.

1986
01:42:23,830 --> 01:42:25,570
Feels like I never left Skulltown.

1987
01:42:29,370 --> 01:42:31,050
Oh, man.

1988
01:42:31,570 --> 01:42:33,010
I love crossing...

1989
01:42:33,010 --> 01:42:34,530
I love crossing the gate.

1990
01:42:36,870 --> 01:42:39,010
School is out for two weeks.

1991
01:42:39,130 --> 01:42:39,690
Yay!

1992
01:42:44,550 --> 01:42:45,610
Oh my god.

1993
01:42:46,150 --> 01:42:47,350
This thing's changed.

1994
01:42:48,730 --> 01:42:51,470
Now that's the Skulltown we love.

1995
01:42:57,440 --> 01:42:58,420
Two weeks!

1996
01:42:58,580 --> 01:42:59,460
Oh my god!

1997
01:42:59,560 --> 01:43:02,760
I heard some people...

1998
01:43:02,760 --> 01:43:04,980
Don't have to go to school for like...

1999
01:43:04,980 --> 01:43:06,040
Just two weeks, guys.

2000
01:43:10,460 --> 01:43:12,020
I'm just gonna die down soon.

2001
01:43:12,100 --> 01:43:13,360
I mean, it's just a cold, right?

2002
01:43:16,580 --> 01:43:17,080
We don't even know what year.

2003
01:43:17,080 --> 01:43:19,160
We're like stuck in this weird...

2004
01:43:19,160 --> 01:43:21,460
We don't even know what year or month it is anymore.

2005
01:43:21,900 --> 01:43:23,180
It's just somewhere.

2006
01:43:23,600 --> 01:43:25,940
Somewhere in Apex Season 1.

2007
01:43:29,400 --> 01:43:29,960
Oh,

2008
01:43:34,260 --> 01:43:34,600
man.

2009
01:43:35,060 --> 01:43:37,200
What is this time paradox?

2010
01:43:38,440 --> 01:43:39,860
We've gone far too back.

2011
01:43:40,240 --> 01:43:40,760
Go back!

2012
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:42,080
Go back, Doki!

2013
01:43:42,080 --> 01:43:43,060
Go back!

2014
01:43:43,120 --> 01:43:44,560
We're too far!

2015
01:43:44,900 --> 01:43:45,900
Go back!

2016
01:43:52,800 --> 01:43:54,920
This hurts too bad.

2017
01:43:55,240 --> 01:43:56,780
She's coughing, guys!

2018
01:43:58,040 --> 01:43:59,860
Doki, did you see a doctor?

2019
01:44:00,340 --> 01:44:01,300
What are you guys talking about?

2020
01:44:01,340 --> 01:44:02,300
It's just a normal cold.

2021
01:44:16,770 --> 01:44:17,370
Alright.

2022
01:44:17,730 --> 01:44:19,770
Buy a toilet paper.

2023
01:44:21,890 --> 01:44:22,890
No, Doki!

2024
01:44:23,070 --> 01:44:25,130
No, Doki!

2025
01:44:26,950 --> 01:44:28,250
Don't do it!

2026
01:44:31,210 --> 01:44:33,410
Get the hand sanitizer, Doki!

2027
01:44:37,940 --> 01:44:39,280
Nice, I got my white armor.

2028
01:44:41,520 --> 01:44:42,500
Oh, my armor.

2029
01:44:42,680 --> 01:44:43,520
I would like...

2030
01:44:43,520 --> 01:44:45,400
Camp inside this room.

2031
01:44:45,580 --> 01:44:46,840
On top of this.

2032
01:44:46,840 --> 01:44:48,900
This is how you farm.

2033
01:44:49,900 --> 01:44:50,860
You close the door.

2034
01:44:51,120 --> 01:44:51,700
Oh, fuck.

2035
01:44:52,440 --> 01:44:53,000
Nevermind.

2036
01:44:53,760 --> 01:44:55,240
We can't fuck around right now.

2037
01:44:58,180 --> 01:45:01,100
Where did he...

2038
01:45:01,100 --> 01:45:01,960
Oh, over there.

2039
01:45:02,520 --> 01:45:03,540
Over there, okay.

2040
01:45:04,680 --> 01:45:06,540
Alright, I was gonna show you guys my...

2041
01:45:06,540 --> 01:45:08,600
My way of camping, people.

2042
01:45:09,440 --> 01:45:10,140
My gamer.

2043
01:45:10,880 --> 01:45:11,880
My rat skills.

2044
01:45:13,040 --> 01:45:13,880
Oh, my god.

2045
01:45:13,880 --> 01:45:15,040
I'm like not...

2046
01:45:15,040 --> 01:45:17,960
I'm lowkey like not used to Carbine.

2047
01:45:18,300 --> 01:45:19,520
The Carbine spray.

2048
01:45:24,920 --> 01:45:28,160
The Carbine spray is so weird sometimes.

2049
01:45:32,150 --> 01:45:32,990
Nice.

2050
01:45:35,250 --> 01:45:36,090
Nice.

2051
01:45:41,530 --> 01:45:45,610
I feel like OG Carbine feels a little weird.

2052
01:45:46,170 --> 01:45:46,910
I don't know.

2053
01:45:46,910 --> 01:45:52,930
OG Carbine doesn't feel the same as the current Carbine.

2054
01:45:53,050 --> 01:45:54,590
I have no idea.

2055
01:45:54,870 --> 01:46:00,910
I forgot what OG Carbine and like the...

2056
01:46:04,450 --> 01:46:07,590
Yeah, it's a bit wacky.

2057
01:46:08,330 --> 01:46:13,590
The tracking for it is a bit wacky versus the current Carbine.

2058
01:46:13,590 --> 01:46:13,630
Okay.

2059
01:46:15,350 --> 01:46:16,010
Go back!

2060
01:46:16,110 --> 01:46:17,310
That's too far back!

2061
01:46:19,610 --> 01:46:21,730
Yeah, Mozamb... Mozamb's trash.

2062
01:46:22,210 --> 01:46:22,810
100% agree.

2063
01:46:22,930 --> 01:46:24,270
I 100% agree.

2064
01:46:28,290 --> 01:46:30,750
One guy is missing from that team.

2065
01:46:31,370 --> 01:46:32,750
I didn't full kill him.

2066
01:46:32,830 --> 01:46:34,150
So he's hiding somewhere.

2067
01:46:35,810 --> 01:46:37,150
One of them is hiding.

2068
01:46:37,650 --> 01:46:39,010
I know for sure.

2069
01:46:39,810 --> 01:46:41,950
Cause I didn't get full kill on him.

2070
01:46:42,790 --> 01:46:44,310
Oh, I hear him.

2071
01:46:46,910 --> 01:46:47,790
No, that was me.

2072
01:46:49,870 --> 01:46:50,470
Whoops.

2073
01:46:51,170 --> 01:46:52,310
That was me, guys.

2074
01:46:52,410 --> 01:46:53,290
I heard myself.

2075
01:46:54,590 --> 01:46:58,610
I like Alternator more versus OG Carbine.

2076
01:47:00,330 --> 01:47:02,350
I swear to god.

2077
01:47:03,370 --> 01:47:05,990
I wish they did bring this rank mode back.

2078
01:47:07,050 --> 01:47:12,130
Cause I know I know the third is still alive.

2079
01:47:13,630 --> 01:47:14,170
Okay.

2080
01:47:14,450 --> 01:47:15,530
We gotta go over there.

2081
01:47:18,700 --> 01:47:19,240
Alright.

2082
01:47:19,400 --> 01:47:20,340
Off we go.

2083
01:47:20,740 --> 01:47:21,880
God, I miss this map.

2084
01:47:24,040 --> 01:47:25,700
I miss this map.

2085
01:47:27,600 --> 01:47:29,340
We need to get an R9.

2086
01:47:29,600 --> 01:47:35,480
The moment we get an R9, it's actually like we're set.

2087
01:47:35,600 --> 01:47:36,600
We're set for life.

2088
01:47:37,560 --> 01:47:39,920
We literally just need an R9.

2089
01:47:42,640 --> 01:47:44,040
Doki, you got any sponsors yet?

2090
01:47:44,060 --> 01:47:46,040
I swear I feel like I get sponsors like every week.

2091
01:47:46,880 --> 01:47:48,920
Which is so- Which is really nice.

2092
01:47:50,220 --> 01:47:52,260
I'm so greedy with sponsors.

2093
01:47:52,560 --> 01:47:53,740
Oh my god.

2094
01:47:54,040 --> 01:47:55,980
I was like, this is not Octane area.

2095
01:47:56,560 --> 01:47:57,940
I was like, what is this place?

2096
01:47:57,980 --> 01:47:59,140
I forgot this area.

2097
01:47:59,600 --> 01:48:01,800
End zone here was fucking terrible.

2098
01:48:02,040 --> 01:48:03,280
I hated end zone here.

2099
01:48:03,880 --> 01:48:05,240
Cause you can be anywhere.

2100
01:48:08,620 --> 01:48:09,060
Uh...

2101
01:48:09,060 --> 01:48:10,620
What was I talking about?

2102
01:48:10,760 --> 01:48:12,200
I don't remember what I was talking about.

2103
01:48:12,500 --> 01:48:13,100
Oh yeah!

2104
01:48:13,360 --> 01:48:16,960
Cause I never had the opportunity to get sponsors a lot.

2105
01:48:17,080 --> 01:48:18,920
It was so rare for me to get sponsors.

2106
01:48:19,340 --> 01:48:20,740
Now I'm so fucking greedy.

2107
01:48:21,200 --> 01:48:22,880
They'll be like, do you want a sponsor?

2108
01:48:23,040 --> 01:48:24,420
And I don't even hesitate.

2109
01:48:24,580 --> 01:48:25,880
I'm just like, yes.

2110
01:48:27,480 --> 01:48:28,800
Yes, I do.

2111
01:48:31,160 --> 01:48:31,600
Yes.

2112
01:48:31,600 --> 01:48:33,920
Give me all of it.

2113
01:48:36,200 --> 01:48:36,920
Yes.

2114
01:48:38,460 --> 01:48:39,960
I'm so greedy.

2115
01:48:42,200 --> 01:48:43,740
She sold out.

2116
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:47,100
I've been selling out since the- Okay.

2117
01:48:47,400 --> 01:48:50,280
Alright, I've been selling out since the beginning.

2118
01:48:50,620 --> 01:48:52,380
Who do you think you're talking to?

2119
01:48:53,580 --> 01:48:55,200
Oh my god.

2120
01:49:03,620 --> 01:49:04,160
Oh.

2121
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:07,180
Oh no!

2122
01:49:07,180 --> 01:49:08,980
Doesn't help.

2123
01:49:22,380 --> 01:49:22,940
No!

2124
01:49:24,340 --> 01:49:26,380
If only I had an- What?

2125
01:49:29,730 --> 01:49:32,170
He was actually- Oh, he was okay.

2126
01:49:32,330 --> 01:49:33,090
He was rolling.

2127
01:49:33,250 --> 01:49:35,010
Oh, it feels just like season one.

2128
01:49:35,450 --> 01:49:37,010
Feels just like season one.

2129
01:49:37,210 --> 01:49:39,770
Looking at him, standing still at my box.

2130
01:49:39,870 --> 01:49:41,230
Oh, it doesn't hurt any less.

2131
01:49:41,590 --> 01:49:43,270
Does not hurt any less.

2132
01:49:48,630 --> 01:49:49,190
Oh.

2133
01:49:56,270 --> 01:49:58,050
Oh my gosh, my heart.

2134
01:49:59,010 --> 01:49:59,810
My fucking heart.

2135
01:50:06,200 --> 01:50:08,660
The moment I get done R9, we win.

2136
01:50:08,760 --> 01:50:09,900
It's just that easy.

2137
01:50:10,960 --> 01:50:12,660
Honestly, that's all I need.

2138
01:50:12,760 --> 01:50:15,460
I just need a goddamn R9.

2139
01:50:18,240 --> 01:50:21,680
Like, R9 is the way to go!

2140
01:50:25,320 --> 01:50:27,500
It's literally- It's literally it!

2141
01:50:28,320 --> 01:50:29,980
We win when I get R9!

2142
01:50:30,540 --> 01:50:32,080
It really is just that easy.

2143
01:50:32,200 --> 01:50:33,560
Like, nope, they can't do anything.

2144
01:50:34,020 --> 01:50:36,680
I literally have aimbot when I have an R9.

2145
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:40,540
It's just- Like, I just locked in.

2146
01:50:42,340 --> 01:50:45,280
I think I found the R9 once.

2147
01:50:49,240 --> 01:50:51,020
Only one time.

2148
01:50:53,140 --> 01:51:00,680
This entire- I've been playing for almost two hours and we found the R9 one time.

2149
01:51:00,820 --> 01:51:01,680
Like, what in the world?

2150
01:51:02,100 --> 01:51:03,160
Where are we?

2151
01:51:03,560 --> 01:51:05,160
Where the fuck are we?

2152
01:51:07,740 --> 01:51:08,700
Where are you?

2153
01:51:08,820 --> 01:51:09,540
I don't know!

2154
01:51:10,140 --> 01:51:12,280
Did you guys saw the R9 literally one time?

2155
01:51:12,420 --> 01:51:13,180
Oh my god, it's time.

2156
01:51:15,260 --> 01:51:16,760
I should've went caustic.

2157
01:51:16,860 --> 01:51:19,680
I should've went caustic and bunkered up.

2158
01:51:22,440 --> 01:51:25,260
Sounds exactly like season one.

2159
01:51:26,360 --> 01:51:28,800
If only I went caustic and bunkered up.

2160
01:51:30,800 --> 01:51:31,480
Okay.

2161
01:51:32,600 --> 01:51:33,180
It's time.

2162
01:51:36,220 --> 01:51:38,140
Oh my god, it's time.

2163
01:51:40,620 --> 01:51:42,220
Oh my god, it's time!

2164
01:51:42,320 --> 01:51:43,100
But I have no ammo!

2165
01:51:43,100 --> 01:51:43,500
I have no ammo!

2166
01:51:45,440 --> 01:51:47,560
I have zero ammo!

2167
01:51:50,960 --> 01:51:53,000
It's time, but where's the ammo?

2168
01:51:53,680 --> 01:51:54,560
Like, are you serious?

2169
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:57,820
Are you- This guy took all the light!

2170
01:52:00,670 --> 01:52:01,870
Do you wanna win?

2171
01:52:02,350 --> 01:52:04,370
Do you wanna win, you stupid lifeline?

2172
01:52:07,370 --> 01:52:07,950
Okay.

2173
01:52:08,310 --> 01:52:09,410
Are you serious?

2174
01:52:13,110 --> 01:52:14,710
Oh my god, thank god.

2175
01:52:14,710 --> 01:52:15,050
Alright, okay.

2176
01:52:15,910 --> 01:52:16,990
Alright, let's go.

2177
01:52:20,720 --> 01:52:22,020
They have to fly down.

2178
01:52:22,420 --> 01:52:23,380
They're gonna drop, right?

2179
01:52:24,340 --> 01:52:26,040
I'm gonna wait for one of them to drop down.

2180
01:52:28,280 --> 01:52:29,760
They'll drop down, right?

2181
01:52:31,220 --> 01:52:32,700
Maybe they'll drop down.

2182
01:52:33,400 --> 01:52:34,020
I'm hunting.

2183
01:52:34,360 --> 01:52:35,840
Shh, be very quiet.

2184
01:52:36,060 --> 01:52:37,560
I'm hunting for players.

2185
01:52:40,130 --> 01:52:41,240
Oh shit, nevermind.

2186
01:52:41,760 --> 01:52:43,540
Oh, nevermind, okay.

2187
01:52:47,180 --> 01:52:47,720
Where?

2188
01:53:06,900 --> 01:53:09,220
Oh, this is two different- this is a full- Oh!

2189
01:53:12,080 --> 01:53:13,940
Wait, what the fuck?

2190
01:53:13,980 --> 01:53:14,700
This is not fair!

2191
01:53:15,020 --> 01:53:17,220
It's a full team?!

2192
01:53:18,200 --> 01:53:18,740
Okay.

2193
01:53:19,540 --> 01:53:29,620
Look, all I'm saying is that I have to fight different people and my teammate- My- Where did our third go?

2194
01:53:29,840 --> 01:53:32,860
Oh, there was a fucking other team behind us!

2195
01:53:32,880 --> 01:53:34,720
Oh my god!

2196
01:53:35,220 --> 01:53:39,000
Okay, look, there was another team behind us.

2197
01:53:39,260 --> 01:53:40,920
I hit every shot I could!

2198
01:53:41,060 --> 01:53:42,580
There was three of them!

2199
01:53:43,200 --> 01:53:50,260
There was three of them!

2200
01:53:52,260 --> 01:53:56,460
I hit every shot there was in my mag!

2201
01:53:59,620 --> 01:54:02,340
I did hit those!

2202
01:54:04,740 --> 01:54:06,840
Oh, Doki could've won V5!

2203
01:54:12,320 --> 01:54:14,640
Oh, Doki needs to rest.

2204
01:54:16,080 --> 01:54:18,840
Doki shouldn't be playing for so long.

2205
01:54:19,260 --> 01:54:20,080
No, that's a lie.

2206
01:54:20,140 --> 01:54:22,000
Doki would be at 8 hours now.

2207
01:54:25,690 --> 01:54:28,770
OG Doki would've been at her 8th hour mark.

2208
01:54:28,850 --> 01:54:33,090
She would've been there for launch so she could grind rank instantly.

2209
01:54:33,590 --> 01:54:35,050
She would've been like, It's rank time!

2210
01:54:35,730 --> 01:54:38,390
Play rank on launch so you can get to Pred first and get a lead.

2211
01:54:38,730 --> 01:54:43,050
Not Pred first, but you get a lead so you don't have to worry about grinding later.

2212
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:50,480
Alright.

2213
01:54:53,420 --> 01:54:53,900
LG!

2214
01:54:54,220 --> 01:54:55,680
This is LG, guys!

2215
01:54:55,780 --> 01:54:57,420
We gotta prep for the other stream.

2216
01:54:57,520 --> 01:54:58,620
God, it's so fun though.

2217
01:54:58,920 --> 01:55:04,180
I might stream more Season 1 Apex.

2218
01:55:04,180 --> 01:55:05,560
I don't know!

2219
01:55:05,740 --> 01:55:06,700
It's just really fun.

2220
01:55:06,880 --> 01:55:11,700
I've been really enjoying Season 1 Apex a lot.

2221
01:55:19,780 --> 01:55:20,500
I would?

2222
01:55:20,520 --> 01:55:27,560
I would Gorilla stream today, but like my schedule this week is so fucking bad that I don't want to overdo it.

2223
01:55:28,100 --> 01:55:32,520
I don't want to I don't want to overdo it.

2224
01:55:32,720 --> 01:55:38,640
I have so many streams this week and so many commitments and stuff.

2225
01:55:38,640 --> 01:55:40,180
I wish I could.

2226
01:55:40,360 --> 01:55:41,600
The timing was just so bad.

2227
01:55:42,780 --> 01:55:43,720
I wish I could.

2228
01:55:44,480 --> 01:55:45,960
It's such a fun game mode.

2229
01:55:46,040 --> 01:55:52,300
It's just fun to play the guns that I love the most.

2230
01:55:52,540 --> 01:55:52,820
You know?

2231
01:55:54,880 --> 01:55:58,300
I just really miss the R9.

2232
01:55:58,520 --> 01:56:01,600
I really miss R9, Wingman, and Peacekeeper.

2233
01:56:01,900 --> 01:56:07,280
I actually used to run R9 P.K.

2234
01:56:07,580 --> 01:56:12,280
When you're in a team, your team handles long range.

2235
01:56:13,020 --> 01:56:16,180
But I used to run R9 P.K.

2236
01:56:16,900 --> 01:56:19,140
when I played Ranked.

2237
01:56:22,670 --> 01:56:25,730
My Wingman was not good enough to run Wingman P.K.

2238
01:56:25,850 --> 01:56:26,790
I mean, it's still not.

2239
01:56:26,970 --> 01:56:33,350
It's not as good as my Ranked buddies, so I would just run R9.

2240
01:56:34,050 --> 01:56:35,350
I knew my strengths.

2241
01:56:37,170 --> 01:56:39,270
I knew what I'm good at.

2242
01:56:41,050 --> 01:56:43,190
I wanted to thirst him.

2243
01:56:46,230 --> 01:56:47,530
Just because I can.

2244
01:56:48,870 --> 01:56:50,090
Oh, you were the champion?

2245
01:56:50,330 --> 01:56:51,270
That's fucking right.

2246
01:56:53,270 --> 01:56:54,350
Get thirsted.

2247
01:56:54,470 --> 01:56:55,370
We have no armor!

2248
01:56:58,670 --> 01:57:00,110
I have no armor, I just realized.

2249
01:57:01,010 --> 01:57:01,350
There we go.

2250
01:57:02,350 --> 01:57:03,210
Got armor.

2251
01:57:05,510 --> 01:57:06,110
Almost.

2252
01:57:06,310 --> 01:57:06,930
That was close.

2253
01:57:07,650 --> 01:57:10,570
I legit almost forgot about the armor bullshit.

2254
01:57:12,670 --> 01:57:14,450
It's been so long.

2255
01:57:16,310 --> 01:57:17,450
Alright, I'll go this way.

2256
01:57:20,170 --> 01:57:21,190
I hear them.

2257
01:57:21,710 --> 01:57:23,130
Right behind me.

2258
01:57:26,010 --> 01:57:27,710
Oh, that's a different squad?

2259
01:57:28,450 --> 01:57:29,270
Oh, shit.

2260
01:57:29,430 --> 01:57:31,410
Okay, I'm gonna go to my team then.

2261
01:57:33,370 --> 01:57:34,470
Oh no, oh no!

2262
01:57:36,110 --> 01:57:36,550
No!

2263
01:57:41,860 --> 01:57:43,500
Oh my god, that was close.

2264
01:57:48,240 --> 01:57:49,080
Oh, they're fighting.

2265
01:57:49,180 --> 01:57:49,580
That's good.

2266
01:57:57,870 --> 01:57:58,690
Oh, thank god.

2267
01:57:58,790 --> 01:57:58,970
Okay.

2268
01:57:59,530 --> 01:58:00,470
Sorry, I had to do this.

2269
01:58:00,590 --> 01:58:01,170
Sorry, buddy.

2270
01:58:01,970 --> 01:58:03,150
You were scaring me.

2271
01:58:04,290 --> 01:58:06,210
And now, we're out in the open.

2272
01:58:09,770 --> 01:58:11,170
We're out in the open.

2273
01:58:11,470 --> 01:58:11,730
We're out in the open.

2274
01:58:11,730 --> 01:58:12,790
That was scary, bro.

2275
01:58:15,870 --> 01:58:16,370
Okay.

2276
01:58:18,210 --> 01:58:19,390
Give me a sec.

2277
01:58:22,050 --> 01:58:25,410
Alright, let's go.

2278
01:58:28,910 --> 01:58:30,270
They're like right in front of me.

2279
01:58:34,150 --> 01:58:35,410
He's like right here.

2280
01:58:38,610 --> 01:58:39,530
Oh?

2281
01:58:40,710 --> 01:58:42,370
I hear you.

2282
01:58:44,010 --> 01:58:45,910
I hear you.

2283
01:58:46,670 --> 01:58:48,430
You're right below me.

2284
01:58:52,210 --> 01:58:54,970
I hear you right below me.

2285
01:58:55,530 --> 01:58:56,730
Oh, what?

2286
01:58:58,310 --> 01:58:59,930
Where's that sniper?

2287
01:59:05,510 --> 01:59:07,670
Oh my god, that little bitch.

2288
01:59:09,970 --> 01:59:11,670
Just a little sniper right here.

2289
01:59:13,910 --> 01:59:15,490
Oh, come on!

2290
01:59:15,610 --> 01:59:17,250
You're such a little bitch!

2291
01:59:20,670 --> 01:59:22,310
There's a Gibby right here.

2292
01:59:22,490 --> 01:59:23,450
But I feel like...

2293
01:59:23,450 --> 01:59:26,630
Yeah, I was gonna say, I feel like the other team is gonna push us now.

2294
01:59:27,930 --> 01:59:28,630
There we go.

2295
01:59:29,410 --> 01:59:30,310
We got one of them.

2296
01:59:31,850 --> 01:59:32,250
Come on.

2297
01:59:32,730 --> 01:59:33,930
I know your teammate's here.

2298
01:59:35,190 --> 01:59:37,250
I know your teammate is right there Why am I waiting?

2299
01:59:41,700 --> 01:59:43,860
Oh, you scanned me.

2300
01:59:45,670 --> 01:59:46,900
Oh, that's another team.

2301
01:59:47,060 --> 01:59:47,660
That's...

2302
01:59:48,620 --> 01:59:51,500
That's not who I wanted.

2303
01:59:53,740 --> 01:59:55,120
Fucking idiot.

2304
01:59:56,320 --> 01:59:56,800
Oh no.

2305
01:59:57,520 --> 01:59:58,140
Oh no.

2306
01:59:58,500 --> 02:00:00,600
It's time to leave.

2307
02:00:02,660 --> 02:00:06,060
There we go.

2308
02:00:10,060 --> 02:00:10,580
Yeah.

2309
02:00:10,700 --> 02:00:12,360
Is it okay to go back up?

2310
02:00:13,560 --> 02:00:14,700
Well, let's see.

2311
02:00:18,580 --> 02:00:19,940
Oh no, not the other squad.

2312
02:00:21,080 --> 02:00:22,620
Wait, there's another team?

2313
02:00:23,500 --> 02:00:25,260
How many teams are there?

2314
02:00:28,100 --> 02:00:28,940
Oh my god.

2315
02:00:29,760 --> 02:00:30,680
Oh, fuck.

2316
02:00:30,780 --> 02:00:30,980
Okay.

2317
02:00:31,920 --> 02:00:33,060
This is bad.

2318
02:00:33,780 --> 02:00:35,240
This is very bad.

2319
02:00:35,300 --> 02:00:36,220
I gotta take this then.

2320
02:00:37,420 --> 02:00:38,280
Give me a sec!

2321
02:00:38,280 --> 02:00:39,720
We have nothing!

2322
02:00:39,820 --> 02:00:40,540
Oh god,

2323
02:00:43,580 --> 02:00:44,500
you're ledge jumping?

2324
02:00:44,680 --> 02:00:46,760
That doesn't exist in season one, you cheater!

2325
02:00:49,100 --> 02:00:51,180
All I'm saying is that...

2326
02:00:53,020 --> 02:00:54,800
Ledge jumping did not exist.

2327
02:00:55,220 --> 02:00:57,140
You're actually cheating if you're ledge jumping.

2328
02:01:00,520 --> 02:01:02,140
That wasn't a thing.

2329
02:01:05,940 --> 02:01:07,220
I fucking...

2330
02:01:07,220 --> 02:01:07,700
Okay.

2331
02:01:09,040 --> 02:01:09,880
Okay.

2332
02:01:16,330 --> 02:01:17,830
Oh wait, that's my team.

2333
02:01:30,350 --> 02:01:31,190
No!

2334
02:01:34,470 --> 02:01:36,630
One more, last one for real.

2335
02:01:37,150 --> 02:01:38,150
This guy's cheating!

2336
02:01:39,530 --> 02:01:41,670
Ledge jumping didn't exist!

2337
02:01:45,030 --> 02:01:47,150
That was a move...

2338
02:01:47,150 --> 02:01:49,570
Nobody knew that movement tech yet!

2339
02:01:49,990 --> 02:01:50,790
Nobody...

2340
02:01:51,830 --> 02:01:54,670
Nobody knew that movement tech!

2341
02:01:58,190 --> 02:02:00,290
Doki is such a hater.

2342
02:02:00,690 --> 02:02:01,870
He's not...

2343
02:02:01,870 --> 02:02:03,310
I'm unimmersed now.

2344
02:02:03,610 --> 02:02:04,930
I'm unimmersed.

2345
02:02:06,130 --> 02:02:08,050
I'm not immersed anymore.

2346
02:02:08,850 --> 02:02:10,550
That guy ruined it for me.

2347
02:02:10,690 --> 02:02:11,650
He ruined it for me.

2348
02:02:15,930 --> 02:02:17,170
Check his PC!

2349
02:02:17,310 --> 02:02:18,070
That's not allowed!

2350
02:02:18,610 --> 02:02:19,910
That wasn't real!

2351
02:02:20,510 --> 02:02:22,770
Season one was all about bee hopping!

2352
02:02:23,710 --> 02:02:26,810
Okay, Punch Boosting was like season four or some shit.

2353
02:02:26,870 --> 02:02:27,710
Or season five.

2354
02:02:31,090 --> 02:02:32,650
He invented the tech...

2355
02:02:32,650 --> 02:02:33,990
Yeah, he's Sniper Monkey!

2356
02:02:34,270 --> 02:02:35,190
I don't think so.

2357
02:02:36,470 --> 02:02:37,990
Back to 2024.

2358
02:02:38,410 --> 02:02:40,530
We're gonna grab you back to 2024.

2359
02:02:40,990 --> 02:02:41,630
If it's allowed.

2360
02:02:41,630 --> 02:02:42,570
It's the last thing we do.

2361
02:02:42,670 --> 02:02:47,920
We're gonna yoink you back in time.

2362
02:02:57,730 --> 02:02:58,350
No!

2363
02:02:59,490 --> 02:03:01,430
It shouldn't exist!

2364
02:03:02,450 --> 02:03:04,190
We can't have that!

2365
02:03:04,370 --> 02:03:06,990
They should remove all the other movement tech!

2366
02:03:07,990 --> 02:03:10,650
To be fair, I was tap strafing this entire time.

2367
02:03:11,110 --> 02:03:12,310
Tap strafing did not exist.

2368
02:03:13,150 --> 02:03:18,190
To be fair, I've actually been tap strafing the last two hours.

2369
02:03:26,720 --> 02:03:28,440
They don't know that.

2370
02:03:33,860 --> 02:03:37,080
We're gonna have my...

2371
02:03:37,080 --> 02:03:38,240
Toki was cheating!

2372
02:03:38,540 --> 02:03:40,320
I invented tap strafing!

2373
02:03:42,740 --> 02:03:45,340
It's not cheating if I invented it just now.

2374
02:03:45,340 --> 02:03:47,840
I literally invented it in season one.

2375
02:03:47,960 --> 02:03:51,720
I didn't tell anybody.

2376
02:03:53,080 --> 02:03:57,120
I wanted the game to stay pure.

2377
02:03:58,600 --> 02:04:01,120
I knew when tap strafing...

2378
02:04:01,120 --> 02:04:02,760
Became public...

2379
02:04:02,760 --> 02:04:05,780
It would ruin the entire ecosystem of Apex.

2380
02:04:06,040 --> 02:04:07,080
So I kept quiet.

2381
02:04:09,100 --> 02:04:11,080
I kept quiet.

2382
02:04:16,700 --> 02:04:17,340
Okay.

2383
02:04:19,080 --> 02:04:19,720
Alright.

2384
02:04:20,240 --> 02:04:21,560
Time to go die.

2385
02:04:21,740 --> 02:04:23,520
I'm not late for my collab.

2386
02:04:25,040 --> 02:04:27,300
But think of the YouTube guide video!

2387
02:04:27,920 --> 02:04:29,520
You don't know the hell you'll unleash...

2388
02:04:30,160 --> 02:04:32,280
When you bring out tap strafing...

2389
02:04:32,280 --> 02:04:33,340
To the public, guys.

2390
02:04:33,560 --> 02:04:34,360
It's 2021.

2391
02:04:34,920 --> 02:04:37,600
You don't know how bad...

2392
02:04:37,600 --> 02:04:40,940
The Apex esport community is gonna get...

2393
02:04:40,940 --> 02:04:42,800
When you include tap strafing...

2394
02:04:42,800 --> 02:04:43,480
Into the mix.

2395
02:04:43,480 --> 02:04:45,500
I can see the future now.

2396
02:04:45,820 --> 02:04:46,960
All those roleplayers...

2397
02:04:46,960 --> 02:04:49,640
Complaining that they can't emulate tap strafing.

2398
02:04:49,820 --> 02:04:51,500
And then they start to realize...

2399
02:04:51,500 --> 02:04:52,840
Wait, I can start scripting.

2400
02:04:53,040 --> 02:04:55,180
And then actually have aim assist...

2401
02:04:55,180 --> 02:04:56,820
And PC movement.

2402
02:04:57,080 --> 02:04:58,780
Like MNK movement.

2403
02:04:59,160 --> 02:05:01,420
And that's the hell I don't want to unleash in the world.

2404
02:05:06,160 --> 02:05:08,820
I did everything I could...

2405
02:05:08,820 --> 02:05:09,760
To save us.

2406
02:05:09,760 --> 02:05:11,880
The dark age is...

2407
02:05:12,740 --> 02:05:16,580
If people know about what tap strafing was...

2408
02:05:16,580 --> 02:05:20,840
Scripting is gonna start running rampant.

2409
02:05:27,650 --> 02:05:29,830
Oh my god!

2410
02:05:30,110 --> 02:05:33,630
Of course it had to be a bloodhound that sees me.

2411
02:05:34,410 --> 02:05:35,850
Like, out of all...

2412
02:05:37,030 --> 02:05:37,790
Really...

2413
02:05:37,790 --> 02:05:39,630
Out of any character...

2414
02:05:39,630 --> 02:05:40,950
It was a bloodhound.

2415
02:05:41,490 --> 02:05:42,990
It could've been any of them.

2416
02:05:43,070 --> 02:05:45,190
It literally could've been any other character.

2417
02:05:46,170 --> 02:05:47,630
Of course I get scanned...

2418
02:05:47,630 --> 02:05:49,490
By the one character that could find out.

2419
02:05:51,330 --> 02:05:52,610
That's actually crazy.

2420
02:05:53,010 --> 02:05:53,790
What are the odds?

2421
02:05:54,650 --> 02:05:57,150
What are the odds that it was a bloodhound?

2422
02:05:59,530 --> 02:06:00,670
I'm listening underneath.

2423
02:06:01,150 --> 02:06:01,990
It's so quiet.

2424
02:06:06,180 --> 02:06:06,620
Hello?

2425
02:06:07,460 --> 02:06:08,880
Where the fuck is this team?

2426
02:06:10,200 --> 02:06:11,360
This team leave him?

2427
02:06:11,560 --> 02:06:12,840
Oh, this team did leave him.

2428
02:06:13,740 --> 02:06:14,980
I was like, what?

2429
02:06:23,650 --> 02:06:24,690
Guys, don't watch.

2430
02:06:27,210 --> 02:06:28,790
I need a 2x4.

2431
02:06:29,270 --> 02:06:31,030
Guys, I need a 2x4, it's different.

2432
02:06:33,430 --> 02:06:35,230
Guys, I need a 2x4, guys.

2433
02:06:39,790 --> 02:06:41,230
Guys, you don't understand.

2434
02:06:41,410 --> 02:06:42,910
The moment I get a 2x4, it's over.

2435
02:06:46,190 --> 02:06:46,670
Okay.

2436
02:06:47,830 --> 02:06:49,730
I realized I did not loot any shields.

2437
02:06:51,970 --> 02:06:52,830
Oh my god.

2438
02:06:53,050 --> 02:06:54,330
I looted zero shields.

2439
02:06:54,570 --> 02:06:55,550
This is bad.

2440
02:06:56,930 --> 02:06:58,830
There's not even armor swaps anywhere.

2441
02:06:58,930 --> 02:06:59,550
Oh, thank god.

2442
02:07:00,790 --> 02:07:02,610
It had to be like that.

2443
02:07:06,410 --> 02:07:08,890
Guys, I can't believe it.

2444
02:07:09,030 --> 02:07:10,270
I knew I should've looted more.

2445
02:07:12,730 --> 02:07:14,810
Guys, I think it's because I didn't loot enough.

2446
02:07:18,450 --> 02:07:20,330
Where are they going?

2447
02:07:20,910 --> 02:07:22,370
I'm so confused.

2448
02:07:22,490 --> 02:07:24,910
They're like not playing near us at all.

2449
02:07:27,210 --> 02:07:29,110
Like, what are they trying to do?

2450
02:07:33,420 --> 02:07:35,680
Like, what is he...

2451
02:07:36,560 --> 02:07:37,080
What?

2452
02:07:37,160 --> 02:07:38,280
Why does he want to fight?

2453
02:07:38,600 --> 02:07:40,800
No, we fight.

2454
02:07:42,040 --> 02:07:43,080
Guys, team.

2455
02:07:44,820 --> 02:07:45,340
Okay.

2456
02:07:46,120 --> 02:07:46,880
Bro, they're running.

2457
02:07:46,880 --> 02:07:48,320
Team, they're not gonna look back.

2458
02:07:49,080 --> 02:07:50,780
Team, they're not gonna look back.

2459
02:07:50,900 --> 02:07:52,020
They're long gone.

2460
02:07:52,200 --> 02:07:54,240
We might as well just fight King's Canyon.

2461
02:07:58,000 --> 02:07:58,760
It's fine.

2462
02:07:58,840 --> 02:07:59,880
We'll just fight King's Canyon.

2463
02:08:00,120 --> 02:08:01,080
And then we don't need shields.

2464
02:08:01,260 --> 02:08:02,140
We'll just...

2465
02:08:02,140 --> 02:08:03,960
Guys, we don't need shields.

2466
02:08:04,100 --> 02:08:06,320
We're just gonna absorb all the other shields.

2467
02:08:06,900 --> 02:08:08,020
We kill them.

2468
02:08:08,100 --> 02:08:10,820
We kill and then take the shields off of the dead.

2469
02:08:13,320 --> 02:08:15,500
Like, who needs shields when you can absorb?

2470
02:08:16,520 --> 02:08:17,620
That's the plan.

2471
02:08:22,360 --> 02:08:23,640
Oh my god, he's actually one.

2472
02:08:27,260 --> 02:08:27,920
There we go.

2473
02:08:28,500 --> 02:08:31,020
I just had to remember the drop-off.

2474
02:08:33,640 --> 02:08:39,360
I just had to remember how to shoot with the G7 because I haven't in a long time.

2475
02:08:44,920 --> 02:08:47,840
I literally have not used the G7 in so long.

2476
02:08:51,900 --> 02:08:52,400
Alright.

2477
02:08:52,400 --> 02:08:53,160
Alright.

2478
02:08:54,880 --> 02:08:57,080
Oh, get back in here Pathfinder.

2479
02:08:58,060 --> 02:08:59,320
Get your ass back in here.

2480
02:08:59,340 --> 02:09:01,160
Oh my god, maybe not.

2481
02:09:02,220 --> 02:09:04,140
Oh shit, I didn't think he was gonna do that.

2482
02:09:04,200 --> 02:09:04,580
But okay.

2483
02:09:09,870 --> 02:09:10,650
There we go.

2484
02:09:15,020 --> 02:09:18,180
As I told you guys, absorb the shield.

2485
02:09:18,320 --> 02:09:19,360
Alright, nevermind.

2486
02:09:20,240 --> 02:09:21,440
Oh guys, guys.

2487
02:09:21,520 --> 02:09:22,840
I need the shields, guys.

2488
02:09:22,840 --> 02:09:22,920
Guys.

2489
02:09:25,720 --> 02:09:27,340
Oh my god, please.

2490
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:30,400
Guys, there's not enough shields for me to absorb!

2491
02:09:31,360 --> 02:09:32,940
I'm running out of absorptions!

2492
02:09:34,300 --> 02:09:35,920
I'm running out.

2493
02:09:37,540 --> 02:09:38,980
I'm running out!

2494
02:09:42,120 --> 02:09:43,420
Oh my god, please.

2495
02:09:44,220 --> 02:09:45,580
Oh thank god, I can absorb.

2496
02:09:50,170 --> 02:09:51,050
Wait, what?

2497
02:09:55,450 --> 02:09:55,850
It's over.

2498
02:09:59,500 --> 02:10:00,540
He's in here.

2499
02:10:05,900 --> 02:10:07,600
Oh my god, my 3x.

2500
02:10:07,740 --> 02:10:09,580
Oh shit!

2501
02:10:09,860 --> 02:10:10,980
I'm sorry Lifeline!

2502
02:10:13,300 --> 02:10:14,340
Lifeline, please.

2503
02:10:15,520 --> 02:10:17,600
I don't have...

2504
02:10:21,010 --> 02:10:21,710
Thank god.

2505
02:10:21,930 --> 02:10:22,810
I'm running out.

2506
02:10:23,310 --> 02:10:24,490
I'm actually running out.

2507
02:10:29,330 --> 02:10:30,410
Come on.

2508
02:10:30,890 --> 02:10:31,710
Come on!

2509
02:10:31,710 --> 02:10:34,110
Please let me stream in 20 minutes!

2510
02:10:37,840 --> 02:10:39,080
Oh my god.

2511
02:10:39,080 --> 02:10:39,460
No.

2512
02:10:41,000 --> 02:10:42,400
Oh thank god, okay.

2513
02:10:54,020 --> 02:10:54,700
Alright.

2514
02:10:54,960 --> 02:10:56,120
Okay, we gotta go.

2515
02:10:56,400 --> 02:10:57,500
We gotta go.

2516
02:10:58,740 --> 02:11:00,000
I'm sorry!

2517
02:11:00,480 --> 02:11:01,380
Oh my god!

2518
02:11:01,720 --> 02:11:04,140
Okay guys, we gotta go.

2519
02:11:05,040 --> 02:11:07,540
GG's, we're gonna go head to the collab now.

2520
02:11:10,260 --> 02:11:13,200
I think the 3x on the R9 was a mistake.

2521
02:11:13,320 --> 02:11:13,960
It was...

2522
02:11:16,060 --> 02:11:16,700
It was...

2523
02:11:16,700 --> 02:11:18,160
It was a mistake, guys.

2524
02:11:18,260 --> 02:11:19,220
Anyway, that was really fun!

2525
02:11:19,340 --> 02:11:20,940
I'm gonna go get ready for the collab, everybody!

2526
02:11:21,800 --> 02:11:23,900
If I do feel like it, maybe there will be a collaboration.

2527
02:11:24,080 --> 02:11:25,600
I'm not sure yet, because it's a very packed week.

2528
02:11:25,820 --> 02:11:27,440
But it was really fun playing the OG Apex again.

2529
02:11:27,680 --> 02:11:31,440
Anyway guys, as always everybody, stay hydrated, posture checked, get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

2530
02:11:31,520 --> 02:11:33,140
And if you stay up for me, head to bed!

2531
02:11:33,240 --> 02:11:34,360
Guys, you deserve it!

2532
02:11:34,460 --> 02:11:35,500
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

2533
02:11:35,980 --> 02:11:37,520
Alright, see you guys in like 20 minutes.

2534
02:11:37,520 --> 02:11:38,940
