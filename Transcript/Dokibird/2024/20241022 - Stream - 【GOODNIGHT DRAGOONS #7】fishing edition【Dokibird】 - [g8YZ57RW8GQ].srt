00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:47,750
Hello everybody!

2
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:50,250
Hello hu- do you like my tiny hat?

3
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:59,350
I figured, so, welcome to Goodnight Dragoons Fishing Edition.

4
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:10,430
I figured after a very, very, um, stressful day of coaching my BBL, uh, baseball team.

5
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:14,770
Um, I figured it was time to do some late night fishing.

6
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:18,850
Um, that was an incredibly stressful day.

7
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:28,470
My backyard baseball league, what do you mean my what team?

8
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:30,170
Were you not watching my last stream?

9
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:31,710
It was two hours ago!

10
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:41,070
But, it was incredibly stressful coaching my, my, my backyard baseball league team.

11
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:44,990
When the entire team was literally carried by one tiny girl.

12
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:51,090
Did you take the kids out for pizza?

13
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:52,090
Kids?

14
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:55,410
You mean kid out for pizza?

15
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:08,590
If anybody deserved a pizza, it's that one child on my team that literally had the entire fucking children on her fucking back.

16
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:13,050
Not even, you mean my wind trader?

17
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:19,370
You mean that fuck that couldn't hit a single fucking, a single hit?

18
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:22,190
None of my children had a home run.

19
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:25,570
At best, Angela and Jacinda had double.

20
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:31,090
Oh my god, Pablo was an inside job.

21
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:38,290
Pablo was a goddamn inside job.

22
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:51,610
Also, um, funny thing about that stream, um, the devs, the devs that did the remake or slash port to Steam.

23
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:52,330
I don't know what it's called.

24
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:53,170
What is it even called?

25
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:54,390
Is it like a remade or a port?

26
00:03:54,830 --> 00:04:06,330
Anyway, um, the devs that, uh, did the port to Steam actually DM'd me on Twitter after the stream and said they were watching my stream.

27
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:07,190
I'm sorry.

28
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:13,210
I did not mean to yell at the children.

29
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:17,010
But they deserved it.

30
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:24,750
Maybe if they weren't so fucking bad at baseball, I wouldn't be yelling at the kids.

31
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:25,930
Anyway, I'm sorry.

32
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:28,430
Except for Angela, she's great.

33
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:30,490
You're doing great, sweetie.

34
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:35,970
Except for Angela, she's doing great.

35
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:39,810
Anyway.

36
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:42,530
They are kids.

37
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:44,750
It doesn't matter.

38
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:50,070
Children have been fucking training for the Olympics since they are kids.

39
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:53,770
You think Michael Phelps hasn't been training since he was a child?

40
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:55,630
Like, this is real.

41
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:58,450
This is literally champion of the universe.

42
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:01,310
Like, it's fucking high stakes.

43
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:07,530
Like, even if they're children, they should not be slacking off because this is a real sport.

44
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:11,850
It's serious.

45
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:35,250
Anyway, as I was saying, the devs of Backyard Baseball, not the one who did the port to Steam, actually DMed me on Twitter and was saying how much they enjoyed the stream.

46
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:39,750
So, like, is it really my fault if I'm getting enabled right now?

47
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:47,470
Anyway, as I was saying, they said they enjoyed the stream and they wanted to give out keys to the community.

48
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:50,650
So, I won't be getting the keys tomorrow.

49
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:52,310
I won't be getting the keys tomorrow.

50
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:54,790
And I guess, like, what is my stream tomorrow?

51
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:56,070
I don't even remember what I'm streaming.

52
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:57,150
Oh, it's a collab.

53
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:57,850
Never mind.

54
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:03,330
I'll be giving away the keys on the Silent Hill stream.

55
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:06,050
So, that gives me time to stall a little bit.

56
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:13,410
So, I'll be giving away keys for Backyard Baseball at the end of the Silent Hill stream.

57
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:18,650
So, you guys gotta stick to the end if you guys want free copies of Backyard Baseball.

58
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:21,490
Well, it's not stalling because I'm doing it at the end.

59
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:25,550
You actually got endorsed to yell at children?

60
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:29,810
Thank you for the super chat, Mehdi.

61
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:30,270
Thank you.

62
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:31,370
Thank you.

63
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:34,270
I never get punished, I told you.

64
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:37,890
And this is why I'll never learn.

65
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:41,230
Mehdi, thank you for the super chat.

66
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:42,570
Thank you, thank you.

67
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:45,710
Coyote, thank you for the super chat.

68
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:46,350
Thank you, thank you.

69
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:47,750
This game is so awesome, Doki.

70
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:48,570
We hope you enjoyed it.

71
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:52,890
Yeah, I heard a lot of really good things about this game.

72
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:54,270
Because, like, everybody's been playing it.

73
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:56,130
And there's like 4,000 plus reviews right now.

74
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:57,750
Basically, we're just gonna be fishing.

75
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:02,050
We need to relax now after a very stressful day coaching uncoachable children.

76
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:04,170
Thank you for the super chat.

77
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:05,210
Thank you, thank you.

78
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:08,590
TastyDiaz, thank you for the super chat.

79
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:09,270
Thank you, thank you.

80
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:10,010
Hi, Doki.

81
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:12,310
Been waiting for a Good Night Dragons to ask this.

82
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:17,150
But is it possible to add a thick black or white outline to your model to improve visibility?

83
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:19,930
I am legally blind and it can be hard to see the model at times.

84
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:21,610
Thank you for the super chat.

85
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:22,650
Thank you, thank you.

86
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:25,690
I think I might do that for certain games.

87
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:28,290
I tend to not add it because, like...

88
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:30,130
Actually, I think you need a plug-in for that.

89
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:31,850
I need to download an OBS plug-in.

90
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:34,110
I don't know if I could do it right now.

91
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:37,850
Because I need to restart my OBS to have a plug-in for it.

92
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:42,890
But I have seen other VTubers also use it before.

93
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:45,650
But I think it's definitely very situational regarding...

94
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:48,950
Because I saw Mint using it for her cookie stream.

95
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:50,130
Like, baking cookie stream.

96
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:54,610
And it really does look really cute in certain cases.

97
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:56,650
Like, how it looks on the skin suit.

98
00:07:58,390 --> 00:08:00,930
But I'm definitely down to do it in the future.

99
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:03,430
Because it looks really nice.

100
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:06,730
I think right now it would be a great opportunity to use it because I blend in.

101
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:09,350
I really do blend in with the background very much.

102
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:11,110
Like, it's literally the same color palette.

103
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:14,250
So, like, I can see why it would be helpful.

104
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:15,130
But right now...

105
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:18,090
But like I said, I can't really do it at the moment.

106
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:20,370
Because I have to restart my OBS.

107
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:22,410
But yeah, thank you for the superchat.

108
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:23,050
Thank you, thank you.

109
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:25,030
But definitely we'll think about it in the future.

110
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:26,070
And for future streams.

111
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:27,670
Alright.

112
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:30,510
I guess I'll create my own lobby.

113
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:32,310
Code only.

114
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:33,210
Alright, let's go.

115
00:08:33,290 --> 00:08:34,150
Let's have a...

116
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:36,950
We can have 12 dragoons fish with me.

117
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:39,350
Alright, let's go.

118
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:43,550
Basically, it's just a nice relaxing fishing stream.

119
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:45,270
Oh, I can customize.

120
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:47,310
Wait, I can't?

121
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:48,230
Am I just...

122
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:49,110
Oh, that's me.

123
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:50,570
Wait, what's the...

124
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:52,470
Right click to zoom in the camera.

125
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:54,270
Oh, okay.

126
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:56,150
Oh, it's like mini Animal Crossing.

127
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:57,030
Oh, so cute.

128
00:08:58,730 --> 00:08:59,930
Okay, and then run.

129
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:00,910
Oh, that's cute.

130
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:03,070
Where's my code?

131
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:06,130
Tab to open the backpack.

132
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:07,910
There's my fishing rod.

133
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:10,790
Alright, give me a sec.

134
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:16,750
Oh, can I customize my...

135
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:21,170
Can I customize my cat?

136
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:22,590
Oh, I can be a dog.

137
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:23,890
But I'm gonna be a dog.

138
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:29,630
Wait, I wanna be a dog.

139
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:32,370
Wait, what can I...

140
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:33,170
Primary color.

141
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:36,270
Wait, no, I think I like this.

142
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:37,070
Oh, there we go.

143
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:38,310
Wait, unless...

144
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:40,530
Alright, actually...

145
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:41,970
Yeah, I like this more.

146
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:43,850
Cause it's like my colors.

147
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:45,070
And then...

148
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:46,410
Oh, I can have a different tail!

149
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:48,250
It's my current tail.

150
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:51,470
Okay, I want my tail to be up.

151
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:52,730
Yeah, alright.

152
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:53,670
This is me.

153
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:56,570
Oh my god, I can do eyes!

154
00:09:56,850 --> 00:09:57,130
Okay.

155
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:00,250
Honestly, yeah.

156
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:02,750
No.

157
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:06,090
How I feel in the inside.

158
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:11,510
Another day, another dollar.

159
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:16,130
Okay, wait.

160
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:18,590
I feel like this is also me.

161
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:20,350
But like this...

162
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:24,310
My team only.

163
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:27,870
Angela is the only good player on my team.

164
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:29,210
Post-baseball.

165
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:34,790
Post-baseball hours right now.

166
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:42,950
I had Pablo on my team.

167
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:45,970
Okay, this is actually me.

168
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:48,650
Okay, I am naked.

169
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:49,830
I don't have clothes.

170
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:50,730
That's fine.

171
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:53,330
What's Blobber?

172
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:54,790
Red Blobber?

173
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:56,610
The fuck is Blobber?

174
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:59,110
Okay, I'll never know what Blobber is.

175
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:00,050
Alright.

176
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:05,390
When your fishing rod is out, hold click to charge and release.

177
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:07,270
Wait, hold click?

178
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:07,770
Okay.

179
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:08,730

Hold left click to charge and...

181
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:10,710
Oh, okay.

182
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:12,430
And then I can...

183
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:14,730

Okay, press E to interact and buy bait.

186
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:21,170
No, I don't want to buy anything.

187
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:23,110
Catch and sell fish to leave the tutorial.

188
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:24,130
Oh, it's tutorial.

189
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:27,310
Oh, you guys can't join because I have to learn the game first.

190
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:28,310
Is there anything else?

191
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:31,090
Alright, let's go.

192
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:31,610

193
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:34,950
Am I fishing?

194
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:36,630
Oh, okay.

195
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:38,210
Alright.

196
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:43,060
Okay.

197
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:46,560
Alright, I'm mashing.

198
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,160
I think I'm mashing.

199
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,320
Do I just have to mash?

200
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:52,080
Oh my god, do I have to mash left click?

201
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,500
I rather mash space bar.

202
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:58,520
Oh shit, I got catfish!

203
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,720
Okay, can I sell it?

204
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:04,260

00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,140
Oh my god, I'm rich!

206
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:08,700
I did it!

207
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,740
I caught a fish and I sold it!

208
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:13,800
Alright.

209
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,440

I got cosmetics.

213
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,360

214
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:35,680

Where did I go?

224
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:56,120
Where am I?

225
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:57,620

00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:13,370
Wait, that's it.

231
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:14,150
Never mind.

232
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:15,230
Alright, let's see.

233
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:15,910

I'll boost up the sound a little bit and also I'll play some lo-fi too.

238
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:26,770
Give me a sec.

239
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:30,310
I'll play some nice relaxing music while we relax.

240
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:30,950
Alright.

241
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:33,890
Free copyright.

242
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:36,130
Free lo-fi.

243
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:37,610
Oh my god, you guys are all...

244
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:39,670
Guys, where's your customization, guys?

245
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:43,090
Oh my god.

246
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:44,970
You guys all look like normies.

247
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:46,610
Alright, here we go.

248
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:48,170
Alright, it's relaxing time.

249
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:49,270
Alright, let's go.

250
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:51,690
It's time to fish, guys.

251
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:53,430
We're all fishing time.

252
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:55,690
Alright.

253
00:13:56,650 --> 00:13:57,170
Nice.

254
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:01,470
Did you guys see the lunchly thing?

255
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:04,190
The lunchly being filled with mold?

256
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:07,670
That's my topic for today.

257
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:08,610
Guys, fish time.

258
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:09,830
It's fish time, guys.

259
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:14,710
Yeah.

260
00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:15,930
That's crazy.

261
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:16,970
The moldy cheese.

262
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:18,650
Yeah, I thought I was...

263
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:18,990
Guys.

264
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:21,570
Guys, you're taking away all the fish, guys.

265
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:23,650
What the fuck?

266
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:26,490
What did you catch?

267
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:29,210
What?

268
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:30,590
Wait, I just started.

269
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:31,670
We just started.

270
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:34,950
And I caught this.

271
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:35,710
Okay, guys.

272
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:36,250
You guys...

273
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:36,990
Oh, it's a koi!

274
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:39,730
Wait, it's a koi.

275
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:40,270
Wait, koi...

276
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:41,970
Oh, I got ranked up.

277
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:44,150
Koi is expensive.

278
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:47,430
Okay.

279
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:49,350
Don't worry, guys.

280
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:51,210
But yeah, apparently...

281
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:54,010
The fuck did you just bring?

282
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:56,210
My game is broken already.

283
00:14:56,490 --> 00:14:58,190
Who caught this?

284
00:14:59,010 --> 00:14:59,550
Who...

285
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:02,190
What the fuck did you catch?

286
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:03,830
Drake.

287
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:06,210
Oh my god.

288
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:11,030
What?

289
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:12,110
What?

290
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:12,690
Guys, you're taking...

291
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:14,270
Guys, you're taking all the fish, guys.

292
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:15,730
Guys, you're taking...

293
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:17,150
Guys, you're taking all...

294
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:17,370
God.

295
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:18,490
Guys.

296
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:20,070
Press G?

297
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:22,210
Oh, I can bark.

298
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:23,330
I drowned.

299
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:24,230
I...

300
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:28,390
How the fuck?

301
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:32,290
How are you guys getting so much fish?

302
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:35,730
Okay, maybe if I fish out here...

303
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:36,970
Maybe I'll get more fish.

304
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:39,250
That's enough fish for everyone.

305
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:41,070
I should might as well just stop fishing.

306
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:43,710
Christian, thank you for the super chat.

307
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:44,030
Thank you.

308
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:44,690
Thank you.

309
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:46,050
Yeah, thank you for the...

310
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:47,970
Thank you for letting me know about...

311
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:49,710
I can bark.

312
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,350
Swanky, welcome to tomato farm.

313
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:53,150
Welcome, welcome.

314
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:54,790
Anyway.

315
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:57,270
Like I said...

316
00:15:57,270 --> 00:15:59,190
The reason why the cheese was moldy...

317
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:00,970
Was because apparently...

318
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:06,170
They bragged about how lunchly cheese is made out of...

319
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:06,570
Oh shit.

320
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:07,170
Give me a sec.

321
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:08,170
This is more important.

322
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:08,810
Sorry guys.

323
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:10,950
This is way more important.

324
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:11,470
Oh my god.

325
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:12,950
I wish I could just...

326
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:14,490
Oh my god.

327
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:15,050
Come on.

328
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:16,110
Give me that fish.

329
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:17,490
Come on.

330
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:17,810
Sorry.

331
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:18,910
This is much more important right now.

332
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:19,210
Yes.

333
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:19,750
What did I get?

334
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:21,930
Why is it so tiny?

335
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:25,150
Oh wait.

336
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:25,510
I'm rich.

337
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:26,090
Never mind.

338
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:27,650
Why are they all so tiny?

339
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:28,230
No.

340
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:29,910
Some YouTuber made a video.

341
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:38,210
Some YouTuber made a video about how they were comparing lunchly to Lunchables.

342
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:39,930
And then...

343
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:52,270
And then the thing is MrBeast, KSI, and Logan Paul all bragged about how lunchly is different from Lunchables.

344
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:58,970
Because they don't use preservatives for their cheese or food in general.

345
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:05,810
And because they don't use preservatives, the cheese ended up becoming moldy.

346
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:06,970
And like...

347
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:08,510
And it's like...

348
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:11,150
And then apparently in the reviews, everybody...

349
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:15,310
All the parents were complaining.

350
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:17,570
And it's not like a one-time thing too.

351
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:19,130
It was like...

352
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:21,390
It was not even a one-time thing.

353
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:28,690
Parents were complaining all over on the review sites that the Lunchables...

354
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:30,090
Were filled with mold.

355
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:31,010
And I was like...

356
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:31,850
How the...

357
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:34,090
How the fuck did that like...

358
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:37,950
There's no way that passed like food safety laws.

359
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:40,030
Like there's no way that passed the...

360
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:40,530
What is it called?

361
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:41,130
FDA?

362
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:42,170
Or whatever.

363
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:43,350
Because like...

364
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:45,170
That's so...

365
00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:45,830
Okay, here you go.

366
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:46,590
I'll show you a picture.

367
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:47,610
It's so disgusting.

368
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:49,170
It's actually...

369
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:50,070
Oh my god.

370
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:52,190
I was like watching a video of it.

371
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:53,010
And I was like...

372
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:56,270
It's so nasty.

373
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:57,410
It actually is.

374
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:59,070
But here's like a tweet of it.

375
00:17:59,190 --> 00:17:59,970
How is...

376
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:01,290
Guys, you took all the fish, guys.

377
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:03,330
You actually took all the fish.

378
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:05,650
I have not had a single bite.

379
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:06,450
Yeah,

380
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,580
but there's no way...

381
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:15,160
Oh shit!

382
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:16,120
Okay, sorry.

383
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:19,840
Oh, and then I can hold afterwards.

384
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:20,640
Oh my...

385
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,920
I'm so fucking stupid.

386
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:24,440
Okay, now I can hold afterwards.

387
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,300
Oh my god.

388
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:26,340
Yeah, like...

389
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:28,820
Please, I'm eating dinner.

390
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,300
I'm sorry you had to learn like this.

391
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,260
So I was like...

392
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:36,340
So I'm just like...

393
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:37,580
But it doesn't matter.

394
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:42,020
Because they hit the point where all of them...

395
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:44,860
They're at a point in their lives where like...

396
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:46,100
They can't get cancelled.

397
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:50,740
Because at that point, they're just way too big to be cancelled at that point.

398
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:51,880
There's like...

399
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:55,080
And in the end, it ended up giving them more publicity.

400
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:57,180
Even though it's so fucked up.

401
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:59,160
People are all talking about them now.

402
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,600
But like...

403
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:01,100
But like...

404
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:02,540
It ended up making them...

405
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:03,940
Blowing them up even more.

406
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:05,920
And now people are like, you know...

407
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,940
Wanting to buy Lunchly to be like...

408
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:08,660
There's no way.

409
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,960
There's no way they're like...

410
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:12,940
There's no way it's mold.

411
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:15,060
People are buying Lunchly to be like...

412
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:16,180
Is there actually mold?

413
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,680
Oh my god, that's such a cute design though.

414
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:19,020
That's actually so cute.

415
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,360
Because like...

416
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,040
If Logan Paul could never get...

417
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:23,960
Could never...

418
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,840
Like still has a career after...

419
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,760
500 controversies.

420
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:30,360
There's no way for him to like...

421
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,880
There's no way for him to like, you know...

422
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,840
Get actually cancelled.

423
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:38,100
You got no bait.

424
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:40,000
I don't need bait to fish.

425
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:44,720
Look at that.

426
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:46,820
Fishes are still...

427
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:48,000
Oh wait, nevermind.

428
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:48,820
Maybe I should...

429
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:49,360
Nevermind.

430
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,060
Nevermind.

431
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:51,240
Maybe I do need bait.

432
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:52,440
Nevermind.

433
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:53,680
JK.

434
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:54,840
Give me a sec.

435
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:58,240
Maybe I need...

436
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,400
Wait, can I steal your bait?

437
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,100
I'm interested.

438
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,580
The buddy isn't yours.

439
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:05,140
Who the fuck are these many fishermen?

440
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,360
Wait, I gotta buy bait, guys.

441
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:09,060
Give me a sec.

442
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:10,660
Alright.

443
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,400
Bait restocked.

444
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:14,660
Worm bait refilled.

445
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:15,760
Did I refill it?

446
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:16,900
How much bait do I have?

447
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:19,960
How much bait do I have?

448
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,020
Oh, I have five.

449
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:22,420
Okay.

450
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:23,540
Alright.

451
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:24,900
It's fine.

452
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:30,880
Lanty, thank you for the...

453
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,340
Thank you for the one gifted ship.

454
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:33,500
I'm gonna steal your fish.

455
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:36,760
Some people explicitly buy...

456
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:37,360
Yeah, yeah.

457
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:37,900
But like...

458
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:42,340
But I don't think children are supposed to...

459
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:43,060
Who?

460
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:44,160
Who?

461
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:45,480
Who was it?

462
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,540
I'm gonna see your name.

463
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:47,720
What's your name?

464
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:48,360
Which...

465
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,360
Oh, I got the fish anyway.

466
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:50,080
Which...

467
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:50,660
Who was it?

468
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,560
I remember what you looked like.

469
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:53,780
Which wolf are you?

470
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:54,580
It was you.

471
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:55,920
It was...

472
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,000
You don't think I...

473
00:20:57,860 --> 00:20:59,940
You think I don't...

474
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:01,140
I was...

475
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:03,660
Explain yourself.

476
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,220
Explain yourself.

477
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:07,700
Explain yourself.

478
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:08,500
What?

479
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,280
Explain yourself.

480
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:19,420
I can apologize right now or you get kicked.

481
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,200
I swear.

482
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:22,700
Wait, was it you?

483
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,320
I'm sorry.

484
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:27,700
You...

485
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:28,290
I saw...

486
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,660
Wait a minute.

487
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:33,200
Who was it?

488
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:34,620
Actually, I don't actually remember.

489
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,370
It was either...

490
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:37,500
It was...

491
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:44,140
I'm gonna...

492
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:48,280
I'm gonna remember who it was after the stream is over.

493
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:49,660
One of you.

494
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:50,960
One of you.

495
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:53,440
I will remember one of you.

496
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:56,680
After...

497
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,280
After...

498
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,720
After the stream is over.

499
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,160
I swear to god.

500
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:11,460
I swear to...

501
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:12,480
Oh my god, there's beer.

502
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,340
There's beer.

503
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,140
How the fuck did he get over there?

504
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:20,240
How the fuck did that guy get over there?

505
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,400
But yeah, no, it's actually...

506
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,420
The fucking mold shit is actually...

507
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:25,960
I see you, Mudd.

508
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:27,400
I fucking see you.

509
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:29,880
Anyway...

510
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:33,860
But yeah, it's just insane that they're able to...

511
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:36,900
They're able to get away with the fact that like...

512
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:38,980
Who the fuck invited this alien dog here?

513
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:44,620
Who, you freak?

514
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:47,240
Why do you have four eyes, you fucking freak?

515
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:48,680
Anyway...

516
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:55,480
We're conformists here, okay?

517
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:59,080
There's no individualists here, guys.

518
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,040
Anyway, as I was saying...

519
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:12,040
But yeah, the moldy cheese thing...

520
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:12,640
Is actually...

521
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:14,840
Oh my god, wait.

522
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,140
Oh my god, it's fishing time.

523
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:18,680
The moldy cheese thing is actually insane.

524
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,920
Just to read about...

525
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:21,920
Or like watch the video.

526
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,060
It's just disgusting.

527
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:24,800
And I bet you they're not...

528
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:25,640
They're just gonna be like...

529
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:26,760
Oh...

530
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:28,600
Oh, like...

531
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,200
Oh, it's just a one-time thing.

532
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:31,820
But there's like reviews of it everywhere.

533
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,460
Being like it's not a one-time thing.

534
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,280
Because they don't have preservatives.

535
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,620
They don't have preserve...

536
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:41,380
That's right.

537
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:44,140
We're...

538
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:48,460
Sorry.

539
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,480
Rainbow, thank you for the super chat.

540
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,940
Thank you, thank you.

541
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,900
Prime is an energy drink.

542
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:57,160
No matter how you slice it.

543
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:58,620
That's terrible for kids.

544
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,020
It even stays for people above...

545
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:02,020
Yeah, it's for like kids above 14.

546
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,740
But Lunchly is like...

547
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:05,480
Clearly marketed towards...

548
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:07,460
Towards children.

549
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:08,700
Like actually children.

550
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:10,100
So it's like...

551
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:10,360
What the...

552
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:11,000
I don't know.

553
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:11,900
I don't understand.

554
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,540
But it doesn't matter.

555
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:15,760
Because they're still gonna have a platform.

556
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:18,060
Like...

557
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:21,160
So many creators got cancelled.

558
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:25,020
But a lot of them still continue to have a platform.

559
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:26,620
As long as they keep streaming.

560
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:29,260
Pretending nothing bad is happening.

561
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:30,320
That's what I...

562
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,560
This is what like...

563
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:32,760
Being a content creator.

564
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:36,240
The best advice I can...

565
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,420
Like a content creator can do.

566
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:40,080
When you're in a controversy.

567
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:43,280
Is just to ignore what's going on.

568
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:45,360
And just keep streaming.

569
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:47,580
Because like...

570
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:49,060
There's nothing else you can do.

571
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:50,080
So like...

572
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,240
If you just keep streaming.

573
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:52,200
It doesn't like...

574
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:52,960
Just keep streaming.

575
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:53,760
It doesn't matter.

576
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:55,520
Like...

577
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:57,380
Like...

578
00:24:57,380 --> 00:24:59,060
Okay, the fucking...

579
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:02,820
That MoonMoon shit.

580
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:04,060
That fucking...

581
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:08,120
The MoonMoon and his GoonVentures.

582
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:12,200
When it fucking become public.

583
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:16,000
He actually became a bigger streamer.

584
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:22,770
My god.

585
00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:24,590
He actually...

586
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:27,130
He actually became a bigger...

587
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:29,930
Like he had more people watching him afterwards.

588
00:25:30,690 --> 00:25:31,650
It was crazy.

589
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:33,010
And he's just...

590
00:25:33,010 --> 00:25:34,890
And he just like played along with it.

591
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:38,410
I was like looking at the titles of his like Twitch stream.

592
00:25:38,810 --> 00:25:40,230
And it was just like...

593
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:41,930
Goon Goon is here.

594
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:44,710
I'm just like...

595
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:46,070
Oh my god.

596
00:25:46,330 --> 00:25:48,810
And he became a bigger streamer.

597
00:25:48,810 --> 00:25:50,350
More people were watching him.

598
00:25:50,410 --> 00:25:51,550
Cause he's just like...

599
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,090
Well, there's nothing else I can do.

600
00:25:53,170 --> 00:25:54,250
So I'm just gonna keep...

601
00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:55,710
I'm just gonna keep streaming.

602
00:25:57,070 --> 00:25:58,710
Goon Goon blew up.

603
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:03,540
That's a dead poll.

604
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:04,580
Thank you for the super chat.

605
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:04,900
Thank you.

606
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:05,580
Thank you.

607
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:06,620
Oh my god.

608
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:08,260
I got a little crayfish.

609
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,160
Look at me go.

610
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:10,740
What was the room code?

611
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,120
I think it's full now.

612
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,920
Cause like you can only have 12 people in a room.

613
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:15,380
Right?

614
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:16,680
I can't tell.

615
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:18,600
I don't remember if that was the case.

616
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,700
But this was the room code.

617
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:22,600
I'm pretty sure you can...

618
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:25,760
But that's being a content creator.

619
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:27,920
You just keep going.

620
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:29,180
There's nothing else you can do.

621
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,020
You just...

622
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:30,980
You just keep streaming.

623
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:31,860
Cause like...

624
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,400
Even if people are trying to cancel you.

625
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:35,800
Like...

626
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,200
You still want a career.

627
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:38,180
Just keep streaming.

628
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:38,800
And then...

629
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:40,300
And then like...

630
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:41,780
Somebody will still watch you.

631
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,180
I mean it's true.

632
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:47,020
Somebody will still watch you somehow.

633
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:52,200
I have no bait.

634
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:52,900
God damn it.

635
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:54,820
Why do I can only buy 5 baits?

636
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:55,800
Like...

637
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:56,280
I don't...

638
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:57,460
I'm gonna put this in my aquarium.

639
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:58,500
I don't need to sell.

640
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:00,220
Wait.

641
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:00,840
If I...

642
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,720
Can I donate it to the aquarium only?

643
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:07,990
There's an upgrade?

644
00:27:08,150 --> 00:27:08,270
Wait.

645
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:08,910
How do I upgrade?

646
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:10,670
Wait.

647
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:11,390
What did I get?

648
00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:14,650
I don't even know what...

649
00:27:14,650 --> 00:27:15,550
I didn't read it.

650
00:27:15,690 --> 00:27:16,410
How do I upgrade?

651
00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:22,470
Go in the cabin?

652
00:27:22,570 --> 00:27:23,010
Which one?

653
00:27:23,010 --> 00:27:24,110
There's so many cabins.

654
00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:24,670
This one?

655
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:26,230
Oh, this cabin.

656
00:27:27,910 --> 00:27:29,090
Oh, it's a hub.

657
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:30,290
Oh my god.

658
00:27:30,430 --> 00:27:30,750
Okay.

659
00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:33,330
Upgrades.

660
00:27:33,530 --> 00:27:34,850
Increase rod power.

661
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:35,590
There's...

662
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:37,010
Unlock the...

663
00:27:37,670 --> 00:27:38,130
Oh, wait.

664
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:39,390
I can upgrade the camp.

665
00:27:41,810 --> 00:27:43,370
I might as well just upgrade the camp.

666
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:45,190
I'm just gonna upgrade the camp.

667
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:47,930
And then...

668
00:27:47,930 --> 00:27:49,010
Wait, I wanna...

669
00:27:49,010 --> 00:27:50,110
Oh, I don't have money right now.

670
00:27:50,430 --> 00:27:50,850
Wait.

671
00:27:51,690 --> 00:27:52,550
Let me...

672
00:27:52,550 --> 00:27:54,570
Let me see if I can...

673
00:27:54,570 --> 00:27:55,770
Go here.

674
00:27:56,870 --> 00:27:57,730
And then...

675
00:27:57,730 --> 00:27:58,530
Oh my god.

676
00:27:58,610 --> 00:27:59,350
What the fuck?

677
00:27:59,650 --> 00:27:59,790
Wait.

678
00:28:00,890 --> 00:28:01,830
Insert my fish?

679
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:05,630
Oh, I have to hold it.

680
00:28:05,770 --> 00:28:06,070
Wait.

681
00:28:06,290 --> 00:28:07,670
Are these other people's fishes?

682
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:08,830
Jesus Christ.

683
00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:09,570
What the fuck?

684
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:13,930
What the fuck?

685
00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:16,170
What the...

686
00:28:19,150 --> 00:28:19,690
Holy...

687
00:28:19,690 --> 00:28:20,790
Oh my god.

688
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:22,270
Okay, that's a giant ass fish.

689
00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:22,670
Okay.

690
00:28:23,530 --> 00:28:24,010
Nevermind.

691
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:26,030
Nevermind.

692
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:26,590
Let's...

693
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:28,030
I guess I'm just gonna sell my fish.

694
00:28:28,150 --> 00:28:28,610
Fuck it.

695
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:30,230
You guys can donate to the...

696
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:31,710
What the fuck?

697
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:34,090
Where's the head?

698
00:28:34,670 --> 00:28:36,170
I can't even see the head.

699
00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:37,310
I'm just gonna sell everything.

700
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:38,110
Fuck this.

701
00:28:39,670 --> 00:28:40,630
This is...

702
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:42,150
My camp is more important.

703
00:28:44,530 --> 00:28:45,010
Alright.

704
00:28:45,130 --> 00:28:45,290
Wait.

705
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:46,150
What does she do?

706
00:28:46,870 --> 00:28:48,130
Oh, she gives me...

707
00:28:48,130 --> 00:28:48,930
Oh my god.

708
00:28:48,950 --> 00:28:50,250
There's no way.

709
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:51,550
There's...

710
00:28:51,550 --> 00:28:52,570
Way numbers.

711
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:55,050
No way.

712
00:28:55,690 --> 00:28:57,730
No fucking way.

713
00:28:58,970 --> 00:28:59,650
There's...

714
00:28:59,650 --> 00:29:00,810
Oh my god.

715
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:05,290
Okay.

716
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:06,630
Okay, what?

717
00:29:06,790 --> 00:29:08,730
10 out of 10 game right there.

718
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:10,130
No, I wanna be naked.

719
00:29:11,130 --> 00:29:12,390
Also, like, all the...

720
00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:13,810
Oh my god, I wanna be cool!

721
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:15,890
Wait, so cool?

722
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:19,290
Wait, silly guy?

723
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:20,770
Just a silly little guy.

724
00:29:20,770 --> 00:29:21,970
Oh my god, wait!

725
00:29:22,050 --> 00:29:22,690
I have instruments!

726
00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:24,510
You can have a tambourine!

727
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:26,690
That's so cute!

728
00:29:28,050 --> 00:29:28,350
Okay.

729
00:29:30,010 --> 00:29:33,510
Oh, so that's like the...

730
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:35,530
People were buying fish water buddies.

731
00:29:35,810 --> 00:29:36,690
Wait, I can hit people?

732
00:29:37,330 --> 00:29:37,950
Wait a minute.

733
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:39,330
Say less.

734
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:42,870
How do I equip this?

735
00:29:44,570 --> 00:29:45,610
How do I equip this?

736
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,400
It's fucking right.

737
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:51,540
Oh my god.

738
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:51,780
Okay.

739
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,220
Wait, this is perfect.

740
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:54,680
Wait a minute.

741
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:56,160
How do I...

742
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,540
I wanna place this...

743
00:29:58,420 --> 00:29:59,360
Wait, one.

744
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:00,240
Okay, there we go.

745
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:03,620
Wait, okay.

746
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,540
I want to...

747
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:07,180
Okay.

748
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:08,360
This is perfect.

749
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:09,780
I know exactly what I'm gonna do.

750
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:13,540
So, like, how do I buy better...

751
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:18,620
How do I buy more bait?

752
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:22,120
Oh, from 10!

753
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:22,720

00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:25,520
Okay.

00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,340
Alright, let's go.

760
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,000
I know what I wanna do.

761
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,720
What the fuck?

762
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,120

763
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:39,120

764
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,540
Connections on my camp?

765
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:44,260
Are you guys...

766
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:45,360

767
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:46,560

768
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,120

770
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:50,280
What were those hearts, huh?

771
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,440
Oh, yeah, I would like a whale.

772
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,180
Yeah, nevermind.

773
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:55,740
Oh my God!

774
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,200
Wait, is that the whale?

775
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:57,820
Wait, wait, give me.

779
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:02,100
I want it.

780
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:03,180
If I can...

781
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:04,860
Oh my God, if I can sell it.

782
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:06,120
Wait.

00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,060
Give it to me.

784
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:08,120
How do I take this?

785
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:11,860
Are you e-dating in my fishing game?

786
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,720

Okay, wait.

00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:55,100
Alright.

804
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,820
Wait, I wanna see...

805
00:31:57,820 --> 00:31:58,860
Wait, where is my...

806
00:31:58,860 --> 00:31:59,600
Was it this?

807
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:01,220
Holy shit.

808
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:02,660
Massive...

809
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:04,320
Oh my God!

810
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:06,320
I can't even move!

811
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,500
This is how slow I move!

812
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:11,220
Oh my...

813
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:12,340
Okay, here we go.

814
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,520
We're taking it over.

815
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,180
We're gonna bring it over.

816
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:17,080
Oh my God.

817
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:18,380

818
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:19,140

820
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:20,760
It's time.

821
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:21,980
It's time.

822
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:23,780
We're gonna upgrade our camp, guys.

823
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:26,420
Our camp is gonna be beautiful!

824
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:29,560
Yay!

825
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:35,820
A new private island prop and additional items in the shop.

826
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:38,020
A new private island prop?

827
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:39,600
What's the private island prop?

828
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:43,020
Oh, I guess I get to have more bait.

829
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:44,320
Oh, wait.

830
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:45,680
I want better bait then.

831
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:46,520
Okay.

832
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:48,020
Increase rod.

833
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,620
Oh, I should get this.

00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:52,340
And then, I'll get better bait.

835
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:55,900
And then, also my rod power, my rod speed.

836
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:57,360
I'll just upgrade everything!

837
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,040
I'm fucking rich right now!

838
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:02,760
Chance of higher...

839
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:04,240
Chance of catching treasure.

840
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:07,220
Chance to not consume bait.

841
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,300
Wait, I might want treasure.

842
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:12,620
Wait, treasure is better.

843
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:14,940

Okay.

847
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:24,580
A romantic gift for someone or yourself.

848
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:26,400
Okay, where is it?

849
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:27,800

850
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:28,160

00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:50,820
Okay, let's see.

00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:51,700
What else do I want?

861
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,340
I have so much money.

862
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:58,500
Let's see.

863
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:02,720
Where is it?

864
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:03,400
Where?

865
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:05,760
What do I want?

866
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:06,140
Okay.

867
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:07,320
Oh my God!

868
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:09,320

869
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,300
Wait, what is this?

870
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:11,320
What is this?

871
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:14,100
Oh my God, there's so many shit to buy.

872
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:15,060
I don't know what to buy.

873
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:20,980
Let's see.

874
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:22,180
I should get a...

875
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:23,060
I should get a hat!

876
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:25,020
Wait, all these hats suck.

877
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:27,200
Nevermind, I shouldn't get a hat.

878
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:28,660
Nevermind, I just wanna be cool.

879
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,580
Alright, let's see.

880
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:33,600
Might as well just be more lucky...

881
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,700
And then...

882
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:37,860
Get treasure.

883
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:38,640
Maybe...

884
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:39,420
Oh, wait!

885
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:40,560
I gotta get a little buddy!

886
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:42,800
The little buddy can fish for me!

887
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:46,540
Oh my God.

888
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:47,900

00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,300
Wait, nobody's fishing anymore.

894
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:58,840
What the fuck?

895
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,800
Why is nobody fishing in my fishing game?

896
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:01,600
What?

897
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,900
Where are the fishermen in my fishing game?

898
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:08,000
I don't understand.

899
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:11,480

So like the extra ones has like lore and stuff to it so, um I it's I love it.

1104
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:29,580
It's so cute.

1105
00:47:29,740 --> 00:47:46,420
I honestly Um, because I gave like certain things I really wanted in the reference sheet and i'm super excited Um when it's finally complete complete when she puts everything together or when they put everything together so Basically, i'll explain the lore.

1106
00:47:47,020 --> 00:48:12,480
Um so basically, uh Um, the first one the first one on the top left is that well It's not lore lore, but it's more so of like the top left is that uh, basically dragoons can be any color But the default color is the yellow the pastel yellow so you can customize your dragoon in any way you like i'll also add like Um,

1107
00:48:12,580 --> 00:48:38,840
i'll also be providing like line art so people who can't draw can just color in their dragoon really quick Um, and then the second one the one with the tomato tomato goon would be like Uh dragoons can have like certain mutations uh can have certain mutations um for uh On how they look like so sometimes maybe they turn out into a freak of nature and become a tomato.

1108
00:48:39,280 --> 00:49:08,700
Um the third one is that Uh, there's attack there's passive mode dragoons and attack so like, you know Where you guys tuck in your legs and everything and then there's like attack mode dragoons where you you know legs extend and then uh the fourth one is basically uh the fourth one is that uh Some say dragoons were evolved from dragons

1109
00:49:14,580 --> 00:49:28,850
Some say their ancestors were actually Dinos or dragons and then the the last one is basically like everybody bullies the iggoons.

1110
00:49:33,620 --> 00:49:37,280
Everybody bullies the iggoons.

1111
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:37,960
That's lore.

1112
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:41,380
It's true.

1113
00:49:41,380 --> 00:49:44,600
Any iggoons in chat?

1114
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:46,200
Show yourself.

1115
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:50,320
Oh, I see you.

1116
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:52,340
Tuxedo cat, why are you laughing?

1117
00:49:53,020 --> 00:49:57,320
Tuxedo cat, why the fuck you laughing?

1118
00:49:57,500 --> 00:49:59,300
You're an iggoon yourself.

1119
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:04,040
Acceptable.

1120
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:11,400
I like how one of the iggoons just started laughing.

1121
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:12,620
I'm like, why are you laughing?

1122
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:13,760
You're one of them.

1123
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:20,520
No, not iggoon.

1124
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:21,240
No.

1125
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:24,920
Apparently, one of them really likes it.

1126
00:50:25,060 --> 00:50:28,260
So like, he's winning right now.

1127
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:29,000
What is this?

1128
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:30,260
What is this?

1129
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:31,080
Just cuz?

1130
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:31,860
What the fuck?

1131
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:32,940
Why are you in the air?

1132
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:33,780
Okay, get it.

1133
00:50:33,860 --> 00:50:34,640
All right, separate.

1134
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:35,520
Separate.

1135
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:36,640
This guy's in the air.

1136
00:50:37,780 --> 00:50:38,920
This guy's in the air.

1137
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:40,400
Separate right now.

1138
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:43,940
Anyway.

1139
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:46,260
Oh, wait, is he bugged?

1140
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:47,500
Oh, shit.

1141
00:50:47,620 --> 00:50:54,820
Well, even if he's bugged, even if he's bugged, it doesn't exempt you from e-dating.

1142
00:50:58,700 --> 00:50:59,840
Iggoon spotted.

1143
00:51:00,180 --> 00:51:01,840
Why are you saying that, Katis?

1144
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:05,020
You're gonna be an iggoon next month, Katis.

1145
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:05,620
Yeah.

1146
00:51:07,060 --> 00:51:09,220
You think I don't know?

1147
00:51:09,420 --> 00:51:10,880
You're gonna be an iggoon next month.

1148
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:16,060
Remember what you said because the iggoons are gonna remember.

1149
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:22,060
Just you wait.

1150
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:25,360
Just you wait.

1151
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:30,960
So I'm super excited about that.

1152
00:51:31,020 --> 00:51:39,540
I'm checking out like all the stuff I need, like all the stuff I wrote down that I wanted to talk about because I wrote down I wrote down a lot of stuff.

1153
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:42,480
Oh, yeah, this is what I wanted to talk about for a while.

1154
00:51:42,860 --> 00:51:44,800
This is what I wanted to talk about.

1155
00:51:46,060 --> 00:51:49,780
Basically, did you guys, okay, you guys hear about the Pokemon leaks?

1156
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:53,800
Okay, so like I know I'm late to the party, but I've been like wanting to talk about that.

1157
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:54,380
Okay, I see.

1158
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:59,140
Oh, you think, oh, just because you're an alien, you think I'm gonna let you e-date the others?

1159
00:51:59,740 --> 00:52:05,820
Just because you're from this planet, you think you're exempt from the culture of e-dating?

1160
00:52:06,220 --> 00:52:11,120
Oh, just... It doesn't, oh, it doesn't matter.

1161
00:52:11,380 --> 00:52:13,800
It doesn't matter if you're not from this planet.

1162
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:17,920
It doesn't matter.

1163
00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:19,460
You're in our world.

1164
00:52:19,740 --> 00:52:21,140
You gotta know the rules.

1165
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:24,700
The law applies to everybody.

1166
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:26,100
You're in the server.

1167
00:52:26,320 --> 00:52:28,140
The law still applies to you.

1168
00:52:28,340 --> 00:52:29,400
I saw those hearts.

1169
00:52:30,100 --> 00:52:30,980
No hearts allowed.

1170
00:52:31,340 --> 00:52:32,980
This is a serious fishing day.

1171
00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:44,080
But yeah, no, apparently, my favorite, my favorite part was like all the artwork and stuff related to the Pokemon leaks.

1172
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:47,320
Wait, let me, I think I like, oh, this one's my favorite.

1173
00:52:47,420 --> 00:52:48,540
This is one of my favorite.

1174
00:52:50,820 --> 00:52:52,460
The Typhlosion slander.

1175
00:52:52,980 --> 00:52:57,940
Oh my god, the Typhlosion slander is so fucking funny.

1176
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:02,360
Like all the artists were like, please, please leave him alone.

1177
00:53:02,740 --> 00:53:03,460
Please.

1178
00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:06,080
He has, they have nothing.

1179
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:08,360
They have nothing.

1180
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:12,840
Um, it had nothing to do with this.

1181
00:53:14,380 --> 00:53:17,320
My boy did nothing wrong.

1182
00:53:20,220 --> 00:53:39,500
And then apparently, the reason, okay, for the reason why, um, apparently in the end, the leaks, the Typhlosion shit was like super mistranslated, um, because like, um, the, because it was like done by like machine translation.

1183
00:53:40,060 --> 00:53:51,200
So because of that, a lot of the story that like, like an actual Japanese person translated the story, it was not as bad as we thought it was.

1184
00:53:52,020 --> 00:54:09,660
The Pokemon still banged a person, but like, it was still like mixed, you know, still so bad because, you know, human Pokemon relationship, but it was not as bad as we thought it was bad.

1185
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:15,160
It was so bad, but I like how they're like, they're like, oh my god.

1186
00:54:16,860 --> 00:54:21,200
They're like, it's not that bad, but it's still bad.

1187
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:21,990
It's...

1188
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:30,300
Like, it's still a Pokemon human relationship, but it wasn't that bad.

1189
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:42,660
So, um, um, but like, and then like, the other like, wait, why are you guys sitting next to each other?

1190
00:54:43,220 --> 00:54:50,220
You guys, wait, I will, either you guys separate right now, or I'll force you two to separate.

1191
00:54:52,420 --> 00:54:55,880
Guys, guys, you don't, you don't want me to get involved, guys.

1192
00:54:56,280 --> 00:54:58,420
Guys, you don't want me to get involved.

1193
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:00,500
That's right, there we go.

1194
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:02,240
There we go.

1195
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:06,520
That's right, that's how you keep space in between, guys.

1196
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:08,400
You gotta keep space in between.

1197
00:55:15,630 --> 00:55:17,150
A child appeared.

1198
00:55:17,870 --> 00:55:20,210
Where did the child come from?

1199
00:55:20,530 --> 00:55:21,610
Whoa, whoa.

1200
00:55:25,710 --> 00:55:28,350
Leave room for Arceus.

1201
00:55:31,270 --> 00:55:33,470
Anyway, what the fuck?

1202
00:55:34,730 --> 00:55:35,910
Why are three of you on?

1203
00:55:35,990 --> 00:55:37,350
This is a two minimum.

1204
00:55:37,650 --> 00:55:39,990
This is a maximum two-person bench.

1205
00:55:40,950 --> 00:55:41,930
Okay, there we go.

1206
00:55:43,310 --> 00:55:43,990
Oh, there we go.

1207
00:55:44,070 --> 00:55:44,810
That's much better.

1208
00:55:45,390 --> 00:55:46,490
That is so much better.

1209
00:55:46,850 --> 00:55:55,550
Anyway, as I was saying, um, as I was saying, um, and then the other really crazy leak was the whole origin of the universe shit.

1210
00:55:55,990 --> 00:56:09,030
Like, somebody, one of the leaks from the Pokemon leaks was basically, was basically, like, um, the whole story of how the universe, the Pokemon universe was made.

1211
00:56:09,290 --> 00:56:10,150
That's crazy.

1212
00:56:10,570 --> 00:56:18,130
There's so much deep lore with Pokemon, but, like, they don't release any of it.

1213
00:56:18,390 --> 00:56:26,370
Like, and there's so much, there's so much world building, and they can make an actual Pokemon Bible.

1214
00:56:26,490 --> 00:56:27,310
No, you're right.

1215
00:56:27,610 --> 00:56:33,590
They can literally make a Pokemon Bible, but it's all locked up in the company.

1216
00:56:33,930 --> 00:56:45,830
Like, I'm, like, why, like, I get they're, like, making this so, like, artists know what to do or something, or, like, they know how to build the game or stuff, but, like, but, like, I, I don't understand.

1217
00:56:45,950 --> 00:56:55,130
They could have actually, they could have actually, like, done so much with that lore, like, and the world building and everything, but it's just so cookie cutter now.

1218
00:56:55,670 --> 00:57:02,050
Um, it's just so, also the fucking, did you guys see the Pokemon designs?

1219
00:57:02,650 --> 00:57:12,490
The, okay, the, the scary monster Pokemon designs that they, like, that was, like, behind the scenes concept art that did not look like Pokemon art.

1220
00:57:12,750 --> 00:57:14,750
That shit was wild.

1221
00:57:15,330 --> 00:57:16,970
Oh my, wait, let me see if I can find it.

1222
00:57:17,210 --> 00:57:22,070
Pokemon design, um, concept art scary.

1223
00:57:22,410 --> 00:57:35,010
It was so fucking scary, like, where Catern was apparently, like, what Catern looked like, and I was like, oh my god, who drew, who drew this?

1224
00:57:35,690 --> 00:57:36,910
Oh my god.

1225
00:57:48,960 --> 00:58:00,940
Like, it's actually, like, this actually goes so hard, like, I was like, because this is what Catern was supposed to look like, like, holy shit, that was what Catern was supposed to look like.

1226
00:58:00,980 --> 00:58:04,380
Look at him, look at, look at that fucking freak.

1227
00:58:06,580 --> 00:58:10,260
Hmm, it looks, it looks crazy.

1228
00:58:10,700 --> 00:58:17,900
Um, um, but yeah, sadly, Typhlosion has now become the Vaporeon meme.

1229
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:52,040
Like, um, um, but yeah, that's, whoa, yeah, that's actually, uh, I mean, like, you know, Vaporeon has had it rough for years now, so, like, you know, like, it's somebody else's turn, like, and unfortunately, Typhlosion had to be the one to go.

1230
00:58:52,080 --> 00:58:54,120
It was Typhlosion's, it was somebody's turn.

1231
00:58:54,560 --> 00:59:01,760
Vaporeon has been at it for a long time, and now, now it's Typhlosion's turn.

1232
00:59:06,860 --> 00:59:15,820
Like, we needed another person, we need, we needed another, another, another Pokémon to, to go through the same thing now.

1233
00:59:16,120 --> 00:59:21,520
Um, it's a new generation, but poor, like, you know, the Zoomers had to have a new one.

1234
00:59:27,910 --> 00:59:29,770
It doesn't need a copypasta.

1235
00:59:30,090 --> 00:59:33,710
The company made the copy, the company made it.

1236
00:59:33,930 --> 00:59:38,850
Like, at that point, like, the company itself gave us the...

1237
00:59:42,470 --> 00:59:47,190
They gave us, they handed it to us at that point.

1238
00:59:47,270 --> 00:59:51,830
We don't need to create our own, they literally just handed it to us.

1239
00:59:55,010 --> 01:00:00,250
Um, oh, but I think this one's my, I think, like, the Pastel Zigzagoon was really cute.

1240
01:00:00,350 --> 01:00:16,070
I don't know if you guys saw the, um, the past, the, like, the beta pixel art of Pokémon, but the, ah, the Pastel one was, the Pastel Zigzagoon was so fucking cute.

1241
01:00:16,150 --> 01:00:20,670
I wish that was, I wish that was what the actual design looked like in the end.

1242
01:00:27,050 --> 01:00:30,470
Um, all right, what else did I want to talk about today?

1243
01:00:30,930 --> 01:00:34,030
Oh my god, I wish I could, I, god, I hate coughing so much.

1244
01:00:34,110 --> 01:00:38,070
I think that the worst part about getting sick is just the non-stop coughing.

1245
01:00:38,810 --> 01:00:41,350
Um, it's just such a pain.

1246
01:00:43,890 --> 01:00:52,230
Ah, I want to do so much, I want to do so much, but the coughing is just fucking killing me sometimes.

1247
01:00:52,670 --> 01:01:01,090
Um, but all I can do, like, like, even if I rest, it doesn't matter because it's more so of, like, like, it just goes away in the end.

1248
01:01:01,150 --> 01:01:05,530
It goes away in the end, it doesn't, like, like, it doesn't matter how much I rest.

1249
01:01:05,650 --> 01:01:08,830
I just need to wait, like, it, at one point, it's just gonna go away.

1250
01:01:11,610 --> 01:01:14,830
Um, it's basically the aftermath of my cold.

1251
01:01:15,370 --> 01:01:22,110
Um, but, um, there's nothing I could do about, like, uh, fixing it faster.

1252
01:01:22,310 --> 01:01:23,830
It's just a waiting game.

1253
01:01:24,650 --> 01:01:43,490
Uh, oh yeah, by the way, when I had, like, no internet, um, I heard the craziest fucking rant, um, in the, in the apartment lobby, and it was so fucking crazy.

1254
01:01:44,050 --> 01:01:49,750
So, like, um, you know, I was, like, mooching off the wi-fi at the lobby at the, my apartment complex.

1255
01:01:49,990 --> 01:01:53,670
I was mooching off the wi-fi because that was, like, the only place that, where the wi-fi worked.

1256
01:01:53,670 --> 01:02:03,850
So I brought my, like, foot, I went downstairs, and then, like, while sitting down, um, there was this other lady that was, like, close by talking to this other stranger.

1257
01:02:04,030 --> 01:02:04,910
Like, they don't know each other.

1258
01:02:05,270 --> 01:02:15,190
And then she was, like, talking about how, um, how the RCMP was out to get her.

1259
01:02:15,510 --> 01:02:17,410
And I was, like, what the fuck?

1260
01:02:17,590 --> 01:02:23,310
And she was going on about how, like, um, yeah, like, I'm going through so much shit.

1261
01:02:23,610 --> 01:02:26,890
And, like, oh my god, the RCMP is out to get me.

1262
01:02:27,150 --> 01:02:29,670
Like, I, when I was, like, bro, what?

1263
01:02:30,230 --> 01:02:32,890
Like, the Mounties?

1264
01:02:33,070 --> 01:02:43,170
I was, like, like, I was just, like, like, specifically the Mounties, by the way.

1265
01:02:43,410 --> 01:02:44,850
Like, what's the RCMP?

1266
01:02:45,170 --> 01:02:49,310
The RCMP is, like, the Canadian Royal Police.

1267
01:02:49,730 --> 01:03:00,310
Um, so, like, they're known for wearing the red jackets and, like, riding on horses and the little, like, the little, like, fucking, um, Pharrell Williams hat.

1268
01:03:00,730 --> 01:03:05,070
Um, but yeah, they're, like, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.

1269
01:03:05,190 --> 01:03:27,010
But I was just listening to this, like, um, I guess, like, housewife or house lady, I don't know, um, talking about how, how she thinks she's being monitored by the RCMP and how she, like, thinks that they're doing everything they can to, like, get her.

1270
01:03:27,350 --> 01:03:32,670
And I'm, like, holy shit, like, this lady lives in my apartment building.

1271
01:03:33,010 --> 01:03:36,450
I was just, like, oh my god, bro.

1272
01:03:41,350 --> 01:03:42,890
Nikita, thank you for the super chat.

1273
01:03:42,990 --> 01:03:43,850
Thank you, thank you.

1274
01:03:44,130 --> 01:03:49,370
Joke's gonna be on you when a squad of Mounties are raiding your building.

1275
01:03:49,810 --> 01:03:51,690
Thank you for the super chat.

1276
01:03:51,830 --> 01:03:53,150
Thank you, thank you.

1277
01:03:53,490 --> 01:04:05,750
And I was just, like, and I was just, like, I didn't want to, like, like, you know, I wanted to move away, but I also didn't want to move away because I was, like, what else is she gonna talk about?

1278
01:04:06,090 --> 01:04:19,150
Like, and then, apparently, she was, like, talking about how she's, like, in the, she's, like, in a category for, like, national, like, risk of national security.

1279
01:04:19,450 --> 01:04:23,130
And all I could think about was, like, who are you?

1280
01:04:23,350 --> 01:04:42,270
I don't know if she's actually crazy or, like, like, that's, like, legit because she's, like, oh yeah, no, okay, the most, oh my god, she was, like, saying how, like, yeah, okay, okay, like, I, I was, I was a little freaked out because the, it was crazy because,

1281
01:04:42,410 --> 01:04:55,050
like, I was a little freaked out because she was saying how, like, yeah, they took away my kid because, like, I'm, I'm, like, put in a category that's, like, threat to national security.

1282
01:04:55,290 --> 01:04:58,430
And then I was, like, excuse me?

1283
01:04:59,190 --> 01:05:02,110
And I was, like, you were able to rent an apartment here?

1284
01:05:02,490 --> 01:05:08,990
This is a very expensive place and you somehow were able to rent an apartment here?

1285
01:05:09,270 --> 01:05:10,750
I was, like, what?

1286
01:05:12,230 --> 01:05:17,010
And then, and then she went on to talk about how, like, the RCP is all together, like, everything.

1287
01:05:22,390 --> 01:05:29,630
I was, like, how did you pass the background check to, like, be here?

1288
01:05:30,150 --> 01:05:33,370
I, I was so surprised.

1289
01:05:33,490 --> 01:05:42,050
I was, like, there's no way you, there's no way you passed the background, background check to fucking rent here.

1290
01:05:42,410 --> 01:05:45,270
The rent here is, like, fucking expensive.

1291
01:05:45,910 --> 01:05:58,330
The reason why I picked, like, the reason why is that, like, the security-wise reason, by the way, like, the build, like, the place, like, I always pick places that have, like, good security, um, and everything.

1292
01:05:58,930 --> 01:06:01,910
And, like, it's also, like, a really nice place.

1293
01:06:02,090 --> 01:06:06,450
So I'm just, like, how did, how, how did you get here?

1294
01:06:06,450 --> 01:06:09,550
Like, I don't know if you're just, I, I don't know.

1295
01:06:09,970 --> 01:06:15,230
I, I, I was, like, oh my god.

1296
01:06:15,370 --> 01:06:28,330
And then the other lady, she didn't realize she was talking to somebody like that because the conversation at first was, like, very nice.

1297
01:06:28,490 --> 01:06:35,290
Like, they were having a nice conversation about, like, like, you know, like, they were having small talk.

1298
01:06:35,790 --> 01:06:45,990
And then, and then the lady started talking about fucking RCMP and, like, like, fucking her daughter taking away from her and stuff because she's a threat to national security.

1299
01:06:46,310 --> 01:06:49,510
And then, and then the other lady was just, like, oh wow.

1300
01:06:51,690 --> 01:06:52,710
Oh my god.

1301
01:06:53,030 --> 01:07:00,370
I think the other lady was just, like, I was just, like, oh, I did not expect the conversation to turn like that, too.

1302
01:07:04,230 --> 01:07:08,690
And she's just, like, oh, she, I, she didn't know what to say.

1303
01:07:09,130 --> 01:07:12,170
She was just, she just didn't know what to say, like, oh.

1304
01:07:13,130 --> 01:07:16,750
And then at the end was, like, well, I hope you get your daughter back.

1305
01:07:18,070 --> 01:07:21,170
And I was just, like, oh, oh my god.

1306
01:07:21,370 --> 01:07:23,170
And I just, I just laughed at that point.

1307
01:07:23,270 --> 01:07:26,910
Like, I think I, like, I heard she was, like, well, I hope you get your daughter back.

1308
01:07:26,930 --> 01:07:27,750
And then I just laughed.

1309
01:07:27,750 --> 01:07:30,250
I went back to my, I went back to my room.

1310
01:07:30,470 --> 01:07:36,890
I went... I didn't know what conversation.

1311
01:07:37,510 --> 01:07:39,490
I was, like, oh my god.

1312
01:07:39,550 --> 01:07:41,590
I didn't even know what conversation I was overhearing.

1313
01:07:45,510 --> 01:07:46,990
Oh my god.

1314
01:07:48,370 --> 01:07:51,150
Um, but yeah, um, yeah.

1315
01:07:51,350 --> 01:07:52,430
No, don't say that.

1316
01:07:52,430 --> 01:07:53,330
I'm not an accomplice.

1317
01:07:53,390 --> 01:07:55,170
Please don't say, don't say that.

1318
01:07:55,390 --> 01:07:56,770
I don't, I'm scared.

1319
01:08:02,810 --> 01:08:05,930
Um, anyway, anyway, um, what else?

1320
01:08:06,090 --> 01:08:19,810
No, oh yeah, but by the way, guys, um, I want to really, oh my gosh, next week, I really want to play Sniper Elite, because there's this one part in Sniper Elite that's, this is a game that I've been trying to get perms for in the past, but never could.

1321
01:08:19,810 --> 01:08:26,690
And, like, because there was one thing, I've never played Sniper Elite before, but we all know why I want to play this.

1322
01:08:30,250 --> 01:08:34,410
We all know why I want to play Sniper Elite.

1323
01:08:35,190 --> 01:08:43,170
There's one moment in Sniper Elite that I've always wanted to try, because I've never played that game before.

1324
01:08:43,650 --> 01:08:45,170
And, like, I want to...

1325
01:08:47,130 --> 01:08:51,190
I want to, I want to play it next week.

1326
01:08:52,130 --> 01:08:56,990
I wonder, it's very, it's very infamous for one thing.

1327
01:08:59,710 --> 01:09:03,930
So, that's something I'm excited for it, um, next week.

1328
01:09:04,370 --> 01:09:11,730
Um, oh, also, uh, voice packs, um, the Halloween voice pack is coming out soon.

1329
01:09:11,870 --> 01:09:23,250
We're just making, uh, graphics for it to sell, um, but I'm super duper excited, uh, because, um, um, sound guy just finished editing it.

1330
01:09:23,310 --> 01:09:24,210
I'll give you a sneak peek.

1331
01:09:24,410 --> 01:09:26,350
I'll give you guys a sneak peek of it.

1332
01:09:26,550 --> 01:09:33,710
Um, it'll be, like, a five-second sneak peek anyway, um, but it'll be on sale on the store for, like, uh, I think, like, five dollars.

1333
01:09:33,950 --> 01:09:36,010
I think that's, I don't even know how to price voice packs.

1334
01:09:36,370 --> 01:09:44,530
Um, and it's gonna come with an exclusive wallpaper, um, that's made just for the sound pack, uh, sorry, voice pack, sorry, made for the voice pack.

1335
01:09:44,630 --> 01:09:46,090
Let me play it real quick.

1336
01:09:46,170 --> 01:09:48,050
Let me find... I have so many chat messages.

1337
01:09:48,510 --> 01:09:49,470
I'll give you guys a sneak peek.

1338
01:09:49,850 --> 01:09:51,130
I don't know if you guys can hear it, though.

1339
01:09:51,990 --> 01:09:53,510
Um, let me know if you guys can hear this.

1340
01:09:56,580 --> 01:09:57,400
Can you guys hear it?

1341
01:09:57,740 --> 01:09:57,820
Knock, knock.

1342
01:09:59,460 --> 01:10:00,620
Hey, did you forget?

1343
01:10:02,240 --> 01:10:05,080
We're supposed to hang out together for Halloween, of course.

1344
01:10:05,640 --> 01:10:06,340
Alright, that's it.

1345
01:10:06,380 --> 01:10:07,260
That's your sneak peek.

1346
01:10:13,340 --> 01:10:18,220
That's your sneak peek, but it comes with a wallpaper that's themed around...

1347
01:10:18,220 --> 01:10:24,800
It comes with a wallpaper that's themed around, um, um, around the voice pack, too.

1348
01:10:25,220 --> 01:10:28,520
Uh, so yeah, it'll be five dollars, um, and you get a wallpaper.

1349
01:10:30,020 --> 01:10:40,900
But, um, it's something I've been... I'm glad I can finally start doing... doing now, um, because, um, because, uh, it's something I've been wanting.

1350
01:10:41,060 --> 01:10:46,060
Like, there's, like, a lot of things I can finally do now that things are cooling down and everything.

1351
01:10:46,320 --> 01:10:47,700
Also, another update.

1352
01:10:48,020 --> 01:10:49,060
Minecraft server.

1353
01:10:49,480 --> 01:10:51,140
The docus... I'm sorry it's been dead.

1354
01:10:51,500 --> 01:10:59,400
I had so many things going on that this has been a backburner, but the Minecraft dev has finally came back from his vacation... from his business... Sorry, not vacation.

1355
01:10:59,820 --> 01:11:14,100
From his business trip, and, uh, we are, uh, we will be implementing the... a huge update to the Doki SMP server where people can finally get automatically whitelisted.

1356
01:11:14,300 --> 01:11:19,300
So we stopped whitelisting for a while because, um, it was, uh, there was a lot of stuff going on.

1357
01:11:19,540 --> 01:11:29,040
So, um, the server in... I think, like, it'll be either next week or the week after will be closed down to get a few updates going in.

1358
01:11:29,400 --> 01:11:32,320
Um, and we're gonna have a Discord server.

1359
01:11:32,720 --> 01:11:37,220
Uh, we're gonna have a Discord server that's synced up to your YouTube membership.

1360
01:11:37,720 --> 01:11:42,260
So if you're membered, you automatically... you automatically gain access to the server.

1361
01:11:42,540 --> 01:11:47,540
And then when you're unmembered, when you lose your membership, you get kicked out of the server automatically.

1362
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:50,780
And the whitelist is synced up to your Discord.

1363
01:11:51,200 --> 01:11:55,260
So, like, um, to your Discord slash YouTube membership.

1364
01:11:55,820 --> 01:11:58,520
Um, and from there, there's gonna be a lot of things.

1365
01:11:58,660 --> 01:12:06,620
You guys can, like, donate specifically to the Doki SMP for updates, for paying the devs, for giving ideas on what you want on there and everything.

1366
01:12:06,980 --> 01:12:10,700
We're gonna have a custom resource pack, too, for it in the future.

1367
01:12:11,200 --> 01:12:16,680
Um, so all of that is, like, we're gonna have a huge update soon that's coming in.

1368
01:12:17,100 --> 01:12:19,740
Um, we're gonna have... and it's gonna be automated.

1369
01:12:19,880 --> 01:12:21,940
Like, it's gonna be, like, self-running after that.

1370
01:12:22,200 --> 01:12:29,420
After this update, everything will be self-running, so I don't have to, like, um, monitor it.

1371
01:12:32,220 --> 01:12:43,640
So, like, as in, like, I don't have to, like, technically be, uh, be, like, the project lead for it anymore after we get all those updates in.

1372
01:12:43,640 --> 01:12:46,220
It'll be, like, what's the word called?

1373
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:48,940
Like, self-can, like, what's that word called?

1374
01:12:49,020 --> 01:12:56,860
Like, when it's, like, working on its own type deal, so I don't have to, uh, be heavily, like, involved in it.

1375
01:12:56,980 --> 01:12:57,900
Self-sufficient, yeah.

1376
01:12:58,140 --> 01:13:04,600
The moment all these updates come in, it'll be self-sustain, like, self-sufficient slash self-sustainable.

1377
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:22,000
So, it'll be automated and everything, so, um, I can, like, hop in, not have to worry about, like, um, updates or moderation, because the updates you want, uh, you can, basically, when we get the Discord server, you guys can decide on the next updates,

1378
01:13:22,040 --> 01:13:26,560
and then the devs will work with you guys on what the updates would be and everything.

1379
01:13:26,820 --> 01:13:32,640
So, like, that's basically how it goes, and you guys have ideas on what you guys want, like, designs and stuff like that.

1380
01:13:32,920 --> 01:13:42,080
So, so, like, from there, from there, I don't have to worry about, like, making sure everything goes.

1381
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:48,740
I don't have to make, I don't have to, like, supervise it too much after that.

1382
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:52,280
Um, so, here's, like, a little update on the server.

1383
01:13:52,520 --> 01:14:00,380
So, like, what we're adding, um, okay, so, this is what it looks like.

1384
01:14:00,560 --> 01:14:03,480
So, we added the PvP Coliseum.

1385
01:14:03,740 --> 01:14:16,620
So, there's going to be a PvP Coliseum, um, that's going to be part of the big update, where other dragoons from different, where dragoons from different factions can challenge each other in a fight.

1386
01:14:16,820 --> 01:14:28,080
So, you press a button, and you're TP'd into the Coliseum, or TP'd into, like, spectator section, and you can watch dragoons fucking fight each other from different factions.

1387
01:14:28,440 --> 01:14:31,540
So, this is, like, one of the big updates that we're putting in.

1388
01:14:32,020 --> 01:14:35,080
Um, finally, you guys can, can fight each other.

1389
01:14:35,200 --> 01:14:37,380
Like, there's a point in being in factions now.

1390
01:14:41,700 --> 01:14:46,360
Um, so, that's one of the big updates we have going in.

1391
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:49,320
Um, I think, like, that's...

1392
01:14:49,320 --> 01:14:51,220
Is there anything else I want to talk about?

1393
01:14:54,540 --> 01:14:56,880
Uh, I think that's really it.

1394
01:14:57,240 --> 01:14:58,280
That's, that's really it.

1395
01:14:58,340 --> 01:15:02,340
I think that's, like, most of the stuff that I really wanted to, like, update you guys about in life.

1396
01:15:02,360 --> 01:15:24,740
There's a lot of projects going on simultaneously for me, um, so it's, like, um, it's very, like, sometimes it gets very difficult to, like, uh, figure out what the fuck is going on, because I, I'm working on a lot of things simultaneously, um, and stuff,

1397
01:15:24,820 --> 01:15:27,840
so, like, I do a lot of things, like, on my own.

1398
01:15:27,900 --> 01:15:44,880
I do have a lot of staff and stuff, but, like, there's some things I like to do on my own, just because, like, I'm a perfectionist, and I just like being involved in, like, uh, being involved in the process of making sure, like, everything is going the right way.

1399
01:15:45,740 --> 01:15:48,460
So, yeah, it's just a lot of things going on.

1400
01:15:48,560 --> 01:15:49,140
I want to fish.

1401
01:15:49,680 --> 01:15:50,300
All right, guys.

1402
01:15:50,660 --> 01:15:52,480
I'm gonna catch one fish, guys.

1403
01:15:54,060 --> 01:15:55,080
I'm gonna catch...

1404
01:15:55,080 --> 01:15:55,880
Oh, shit, guys.

1405
01:15:56,080 --> 01:15:58,180
I'm gonna catch one fish, everybody.

1406
01:15:58,900 --> 01:15:59,720
Watch this.

1407
01:16:01,460 --> 01:16:01,920
What happened?

1408
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:02,580
Oh, I have bait.

1409
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:04,900
What do you mean I'm slacking?

1410
01:16:05,300 --> 01:16:06,360
I'm not slacking.

1411
01:16:06,480 --> 01:16:07,980
I have you guys to fish for me.

1412
01:16:08,540 --> 01:16:09,600
This is my island.

1413
01:16:09,700 --> 01:16:10,940
You guys gotta pay taxes.

1414
01:16:11,980 --> 01:16:14,140
Why else did I create my own server?

1415
01:16:14,920 --> 01:16:15,280
I...

1416
01:16:15,280 --> 01:16:17,440
Oh, I still got my snail.

1417
01:16:17,780 --> 01:16:19,180
Oh, you think I didn't see?

1418
01:16:19,380 --> 01:16:20,540
You think I didn't see?

1419
01:16:20,600 --> 01:16:21,640
That's fucking right.

1420
01:16:22,260 --> 01:16:23,340
That's fucking right.

1421
01:16:23,440 --> 01:16:25,620
Don't make me revoke your fishing privileges.

1422
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:27,980
All right, guys.

1423
01:16:28,200 --> 01:16:30,060
This is my private own island.

1424
01:16:30,180 --> 01:16:31,360
It's time to pay your taxes.

1425
01:16:32,120 --> 01:16:32,920
Give me your fish.

1426
01:16:33,700 --> 01:16:34,980
Wait, what's this?

1427
01:16:35,240 --> 01:16:36,060
Oh, he's okay.

1428
01:16:36,260 --> 01:16:37,120
Give me your fish.

1429
01:16:37,280 --> 01:16:37,960
Oh, my god.

1430
01:16:37,980 --> 01:16:38,280
Okay.

1431
01:16:39,640 --> 01:16:46,340
This is a privately owned corporate island, which requires you to pay your fish tax.

1432
01:16:47,340 --> 01:16:48,020
Oh, I want that.

1433
01:16:48,080 --> 01:16:48,880
Wait, that's a crocodile.

1434
01:16:49,200 --> 01:16:49,400
Give me.

1435
01:16:49,460 --> 01:16:49,620
Give me.

1436
01:16:49,660 --> 01:16:50,080
I want that.

1437
01:16:50,160 --> 01:16:50,680
That's a gator.

1438
01:16:52,420 --> 01:16:53,540
All right, I'm looking at my mail.

1439
01:16:53,780 --> 01:16:55,040
I have two mail.

1440
01:16:55,640 --> 01:16:57,440
Where are my other letters?

1441
01:16:59,140 --> 01:17:01,320
Dragons, where are my letters?

1442
01:17:01,920 --> 01:17:02,760
My fish letters.

1443
01:17:04,860 --> 01:17:06,740
You already paid in advance?

1444
01:17:07,340 --> 01:17:10,840
You think... you think this island is one fish per...

1445
01:17:11,540 --> 01:17:17,200
Oh, you thought this island, you only pay one fish per trip?

1446
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:20,060
No, we're charged by hourly.

1447
01:17:21,240 --> 01:17:23,100
It's one hour has passed already.

1448
01:17:23,500 --> 01:17:24,980
It's two fishes time.

1449
01:17:25,440 --> 01:17:26,460
Oh, hey, letter received.

1450
01:17:26,460 --> 01:17:26,580
Thank you.

1451
01:17:28,340 --> 01:17:28,860
Nice.

1452
01:17:29,120 --> 01:17:29,520
All right.

1453
01:17:30,140 --> 01:17:31,200
Oh, I got a crab.

1454
01:17:31,700 --> 01:17:32,740
Oh, I got a pupfish.

1455
01:17:32,840 --> 01:17:33,340
Let's go.

1456
01:17:34,100 --> 01:17:37,080
Guys, give me that fucking gator right now or you'll get kicked.

1457
01:17:37,800 --> 01:17:40,060
This is a privately owned corporate island.

1458
01:17:46,460 --> 01:17:49,500
This is not... this is not for freeloaders, guys.

1459
01:17:49,620 --> 01:17:51,840
This is not for freeloaders.

1460
01:17:52,400 --> 01:17:53,300
Fish or kick.

1461
01:17:53,600 --> 01:17:54,840
Fish or kick.

1462
01:17:57,320 --> 01:17:58,100
Rent is due.

1463
01:17:58,500 --> 01:17:59,220
Ring, ring.

1464
01:18:00,160 --> 01:18:01,480
Rent is due.

1465
01:18:01,880 --> 01:18:02,820
Ring, ring.

1466
01:18:03,640 --> 01:18:05,200
The landlord is here.

1467
01:18:09,480 --> 01:18:13,060
The landlord is here to claim the rent.

1468
01:18:14,340 --> 01:18:15,640
Where the fuck is your hat?

1469
01:18:17,080 --> 01:18:18,080
What's your hat?

1470
01:18:18,220 --> 01:18:18,700
I need to know.

1471
01:18:19,160 --> 01:18:19,900
Wait, what's your hat?

1472
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:20,560
I need to know.

1473
01:18:21,300 --> 01:18:22,580
Where the fuck is that hat?

1474
01:18:22,680 --> 01:18:23,600
What does it say?

1475
01:18:26,850 --> 01:18:28,210
Oh my god, I can never...

1476
01:18:28,830 --> 01:18:29,410
Women fear me.

1477
01:18:29,470 --> 01:18:30,050
Fish fury.

1478
01:18:30,270 --> 01:18:33,050
Men turn their eyes away as I walk.

1479
01:18:33,250 --> 01:18:36,210
No piece there make a sound in my presence.

1480
01:18:36,610 --> 01:18:37,770
I am alone.

1481
01:18:45,310 --> 01:18:45,990
God.

1482
01:18:45,990 --> 01:18:47,430
Holy shit.

1483
01:18:48,030 --> 01:18:49,410
That fucking hat.

1484
01:18:49,530 --> 01:18:50,710
Oh my god.

1485
01:18:50,710 --> 01:18:50,770
Oh my god.

1486
01:18:55,980 --> 01:18:56,900
All right, nice.

1487
01:18:58,000 --> 01:18:59,480
Nice, I got my taxes.

1488
01:19:00,720 --> 01:19:02,540
See, I don't need a fish.

1489
01:19:03,460 --> 01:19:05,120
Why are you fucking sending hearts?

1490
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:07,860
Why are you sending hearts?

1491
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:09,280
Oh, is he bugged out?

1492
01:19:09,380 --> 01:19:10,120
Okay, there we go.

1493
01:19:10,760 --> 01:19:11,220
All right.

1494
01:19:12,220 --> 01:19:14,740
Let's... let's go sell our fish now.

1495
01:19:15,700 --> 01:19:16,200
Yippee.

1496
01:19:16,540 --> 01:19:17,860
Oh my god, look at this.

1497
01:19:18,640 --> 01:19:20,200
What the fuck?

1498
01:19:22,640 --> 01:19:23,740
Wait, I'm gonna keep that.

1499
01:19:25,860 --> 01:19:26,680
Okay, let's see.

1500
01:19:26,760 --> 01:19:28,660
We're gonna get rid of this.

1501
01:19:30,320 --> 01:19:32,620
And then I want to keep the crocodile.

1502
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:34,240
Oh, we can't sell the turtle.

1503
01:19:34,480 --> 01:19:36,160
They're in danger.

1504
01:19:36,740 --> 01:19:37,660
So we'll keep that.

1505
01:19:38,920 --> 01:19:39,320
Nice.

1506
01:19:41,900 --> 01:19:43,140
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1507
01:19:43,360 --> 01:19:44,620
Wait, how big can I get?

1508
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:51,840
Okay, I want to know.

1509
01:19:52,520 --> 01:19:54,420
All right, I want to know how big I can get.

1510
01:19:54,420 --> 01:19:56,060
Oh shit, more taxes.

1511
01:19:58,680 --> 01:19:59,980
How big can you grow?

1512
01:20:02,880 --> 01:20:04,420
Can you grow pretty big?

1513
01:20:07,340 --> 01:20:08,400
Am I growing?

1514
01:20:11,580 --> 01:20:12,920
No, I stopped growing.

1515
01:20:13,140 --> 01:20:13,400
No!

1516
01:20:14,300 --> 01:20:15,680
I stopped growing!

1517
01:20:17,200 --> 01:20:18,640
Like, what's the point?

1518
01:20:23,180 --> 01:20:24,320
What's the point?

1519
01:20:26,180 --> 01:20:27,720
Guys, I'm a... guys.

1520
01:20:28,240 --> 01:20:29,580
Guys, please don't look at me.

1521
01:20:29,720 --> 01:20:30,200
I...

1522
01:20:31,040 --> 01:20:32,060
Please don't look at me.

1523
01:20:32,120 --> 01:20:33,960
I didn't use any... this is natural.

1524
01:20:34,120 --> 01:20:36,060
I didn't use any enhancements, I swear.

1525
01:20:36,600 --> 01:20:37,840
This is all natural.

1526
01:20:42,080 --> 01:20:45,760
This is all natural growing, I swear to god.

1527
01:20:47,200 --> 01:20:51,300
If I keep drinking, maybe I'll get bigger in many ways.

1528
01:20:51,760 --> 01:20:52,180
If I...

1529
01:20:54,600 --> 01:20:55,480
If I...

1530
01:20:55,480 --> 01:21:00,060
If I keep drinking, maybe I'll... maybe everything will get big.

1531
01:21:07,810 --> 01:21:08,290
Okay.

1532
01:21:09,450 --> 01:21:10,850
Wait, wait a minute.

1533
01:21:11,050 --> 01:21:11,930
What's going on here?

1534
01:21:12,530 --> 01:21:13,410
What's going on here?

1535
01:21:13,490 --> 01:21:14,090
What would... oh.

1536
01:21:14,610 --> 01:21:15,290
Oh, yeah?

1537
01:21:16,090 --> 01:21:17,950
Oh, you think running away would stop?

1538
01:21:18,590 --> 01:21:19,350
What's going on?

1539
01:21:19,390 --> 01:21:20,850
Explain yourself right now.

1540
01:21:21,630 --> 01:21:22,810
It's you to explain yourself.

1541
01:21:22,870 --> 01:21:23,470
What was it?

1542
01:21:24,190 --> 01:21:25,570
Does she mean something to you?

1543
01:21:26,210 --> 01:21:27,630
Does she mean anything to you?

1544
01:21:27,690 --> 01:21:28,390
Tell me, buds.

1545
01:21:28,610 --> 01:21:29,630
Tell me right now.

1546
01:21:29,890 --> 01:21:30,990
I'm bigger than you.

1547
01:21:31,090 --> 01:21:31,450
Tell me.

1548
01:21:31,610 --> 01:21:32,370
Holy shit.

1549
01:21:32,430 --> 01:21:33,310
I'm fucking huge.

1550
01:21:33,830 --> 01:21:35,210
Tell me right now.

1551
01:21:36,290 --> 01:21:38,210
She means everything.

1552
01:21:43,900 --> 01:21:44,900
Well, she...

1553
01:21:48,480 --> 01:21:48,980
Oh,

1554
01:21:54,520 --> 01:21:55,480
I'm gonna...

1555
01:21:59,420 --> 01:22:01,900
Buds, it's either you or her.

1556
01:22:02,100 --> 01:22:04,640
Choose wisely, buds.

1557
01:22:05,400 --> 01:22:11,240
If you love her... if you love her, you would sacrifice yourself for her.

1558
01:22:15,850 --> 01:22:17,990
Buds, all I'm saying...

1559
01:22:17,990 --> 01:22:22,770
If you love her, would you sacrifice yourself for her or do I kick...

1560
01:22:23,210 --> 01:22:23,850
kick her?

1561
01:22:24,490 --> 01:22:26,150
Buds, your pick.

1562
01:22:26,450 --> 01:22:29,650
No answers means I'll... I'll kick you.

1563
01:22:34,290 --> 01:22:34,990
I'll kick you.

1564
01:22:34,990 --> 01:22:35,610
Buds, come on.

1565
01:22:36,110 --> 01:22:38,170
I'll give you 10 seconds, buds.

1566
01:22:39,710 --> 01:22:40,410
Goodbye,

1567
01:22:48,650 --> 01:22:48,970
buds.

1568
01:22:49,110 --> 01:22:49,930
All right, Lamb.

1569
01:22:50,430 --> 01:22:51,890
What do you have to say?

1570
01:22:52,910 --> 01:22:53,570
Lamb...

1571
01:22:53,570 --> 01:22:54,410
What do you...

1572
01:22:54,410 --> 01:22:57,490
Muds sacrificed themselves for you.

1573
01:22:57,650 --> 01:22:59,410
What do you have to say?

1574
01:23:06,650 --> 01:23:09,850
They picked you over themselves.

1575
01:23:10,870 --> 01:23:12,810
That's all you could say?

1576
01:23:13,510 --> 01:23:18,150
He chose love and all you could give me is an 0-7?

1577
01:23:18,890 --> 01:23:20,350
That's fucked, dude.

1578
01:23:20,490 --> 01:23:21,110
That's...

1579
01:23:22,730 --> 01:23:24,550
That's so fucked.

1580
01:23:25,230 --> 01:23:29,450
He gave you his entire life to be in the server.

1581
01:23:29,950 --> 01:23:34,470
And all you gave me was an 0-7 and then you keep fishing.

1582
01:23:35,270 --> 01:23:36,950
Holy... oh, that... that's dedication.

1583
01:23:37,950 --> 01:23:38,590
That's...

1584
01:23:38,590 --> 01:23:40,090
That's dedication right there.

1585
01:23:40,190 --> 01:23:41,550
She keeps fishing.

1586
01:23:41,950 --> 01:23:43,690
That's fucking rough, buddy.

1587
01:23:53,670 --> 01:23:56,390
The fishing must go on.

1588
01:24:00,630 --> 01:24:04,290
The fishing must... it's what he would have...

1589
01:24:08,040 --> 01:24:09,480
It's what he would have wanted.

1590
01:24:09,640 --> 01:24:10,500
True, chat.

1591
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:11,320
True.

1592
01:24:11,560 --> 01:24:13,200
He would have wanted the same thing.

1593
01:24:13,800 --> 01:24:15,200
Never choose love.

1594
01:24:17,860 --> 01:24:20,020
Giving like wrong messages right now.

1595
01:24:20,400 --> 01:24:21,300
That's okay.

1596
01:24:21,540 --> 01:24:23,320
This is my privately owned server.

1597
01:24:23,580 --> 01:24:26,000
I can give whatever message I want here.

1598
01:24:28,480 --> 01:24:30,980
I loved him, but I love fishing more.

1599
01:24:31,080 --> 01:24:31,880
That's so true.

1600
01:24:32,320 --> 01:24:33,220
That's so true.

1601
01:24:33,400 --> 01:24:34,300
Fishing is life.

1602
01:24:36,140 --> 01:24:38,080
One last fish for the ride.

1603
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,560
One last fish for the ride.

1604
01:24:49,350 --> 01:24:56,210
This is a lifestyle that we all picked and enjoy because, man, I love fishing.

1605
01:24:57,150 --> 01:24:58,990
You guys caught a lot of fish?

1606
01:25:00,370 --> 01:25:01,150
Oh, Alan.

1607
01:25:02,590 --> 01:25:05,090
Oh, Alan, you think I didn't see that?

1608
01:25:06,090 --> 01:25:06,470
Alan.

1609
01:25:07,410 --> 01:25:10,930
Look how much bigger I am than you, Alan.

1610
01:25:20,010 --> 01:25:21,890
Defend yourself right now.

1611
01:25:24,910 --> 01:25:26,110
Defend yourself.

1612
01:25:26,110 --> 01:25:29,430
Oh, oh, oh, I see.

1613
01:25:29,810 --> 01:25:30,850
I see.

1614
01:25:31,270 --> 01:25:31,710
That's right.

1615
01:25:31,850 --> 01:25:32,530
Get out.

1616
01:25:33,510 --> 01:25:34,110
Never.

1617
01:25:34,810 --> 01:25:37,810
Never again will you be on Doki Corp Island.

1618
01:25:38,330 --> 01:25:40,690
This is a private server.

1619
01:25:41,310 --> 01:25:42,730
This is... oh, Muds is back?

1620
01:25:42,950 --> 01:25:43,590
Oh, shit.

1621
01:25:49,790 --> 01:25:50,390
Shit.

1622
01:25:50,930 --> 01:25:53,130
Oh, Lamb, you're in it now, Lamb.

1623
01:25:53,510 --> 01:25:54,630
Muds is back.

1624
01:25:54,770 --> 01:25:55,510
You're in it.

1625
01:25:56,320 --> 01:25:58,690
You're fucking in trouble now.

1626
01:25:58,790 --> 01:26:01,590
He's back and he saw what you said, Muds.

1627
01:26:01,810 --> 01:26:04,270
He saw what you said, Lamb.

1628
01:26:04,630 --> 01:26:05,890
That's fucking right.

1629
01:26:05,970 --> 01:26:06,690
What do you have to say?

1630
01:26:07,010 --> 01:26:08,530
What do you have to say, Muds?

1631
01:26:09,210 --> 01:26:12,450
I told you, trust no... trust no... nobody.

1632
01:26:13,210 --> 01:26:14,070
Trust no one.

1633
01:26:15,530 --> 01:26:17,750
Your love was for fishing only.

1634
01:26:18,510 --> 01:26:20,590
You should have stayed fishing, Muds.

1635
01:26:21,110 --> 01:26:23,170
Romance was not the way.

1636
01:26:25,850 --> 01:26:28,470
Hahaha, look what you did.

1637
01:26:28,690 --> 01:26:32,610
I told you love wasn't the answer on Doki Corp Island.

1638
01:26:33,630 --> 01:26:36,490
This was... this is a fish only... I told... this is why.

1639
01:26:36,690 --> 01:26:39,470
This is why I made this a fishing only island.

1640
01:26:40,290 --> 01:26:43,070
Love only destroys you when...

1641
01:26:43,510 --> 01:26:46,170
When you could be using your time to fish.

1642
01:26:47,270 --> 01:26:50,550
When you could have been spending your time to fish.

1643
01:26:50,870 --> 01:26:53,490
You let love distract you.

1644
01:26:55,530 --> 01:26:55,870
Hahaha.

1645
01:26:58,490 --> 01:26:59,450
Lesson learned.

1646
01:27:00,970 --> 01:27:02,610
Oh my god, I'm gonna get my fish.

1647
01:27:03,230 --> 01:27:04,470
I'm gonna get my fish.

1648
01:27:05,030 --> 01:27:05,890
Okay, nice.

1649
01:27:10,880 --> 01:27:11,860
Oh shit, nice.

1650
01:27:11,940 --> 01:27:12,720
I got a bass.

1651
01:27:12,820 --> 01:27:14,120
Oh, and I found a lucky coin.

1652
01:27:14,900 --> 01:27:15,900
I told you guys.

1653
01:27:16,520 --> 01:27:18,260
There's a reason why...

1654
01:27:18,260 --> 01:27:20,320
I made sure...

1655
01:27:20,320 --> 01:27:25,480
There's a reason why I made sure you put your love at the table when you... before you come here.

1656
01:27:26,180 --> 01:27:27,700
This is what happens, guys.

1657
01:27:28,420 --> 01:27:34,600
It'll only destroy you for what you... for... it'll only interfere with what you truly love.

1658
01:27:34,800 --> 01:27:36,240
And that's fishing.

1659
01:27:37,420 --> 01:27:41,080
This is a fish... fish only world.

1660
01:27:42,300 --> 01:27:43,420
Yeah, I kicked him.

1661
01:27:43,500 --> 01:27:44,580
I didn't ban him.

1662
01:27:45,940 --> 01:27:49,300
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1663
01:27:50,700 --> 01:27:52,600
What is wrong with this guy?

1664
01:27:53,460 --> 01:27:56,960
Holy shit, his textures are going all over the place.

1665
01:27:59,460 --> 01:28:01,780
Oh nice, more fish.

1666
01:28:04,680 --> 01:28:06,900
All right, nice.

1667
01:28:07,060 --> 01:28:08,420
All right, that's my last fish of the day.

1668
01:28:08,860 --> 01:28:10,100
It was a relaxing time.

1669
01:28:11,140 --> 01:28:14,520
I had a great time just hanging out with... Oh, I got the ring five!

1670
01:28:14,940 --> 01:28:16,060
That's a good way to end it.

1671
01:28:16,860 --> 01:28:17,600
All right, guys.

1672
01:28:18,160 --> 01:28:21,040
Thank y'all for coming to Doki Corp Private Island.

1673
01:28:21,540 --> 01:28:27,320
I hope you guys enjoyed fishing on my private island and I hope you guys learned a...

1674
01:28:27,320 --> 01:28:28,920
valuable lesson.

1675
01:28:30,180 --> 01:28:33,080
That fishing is the only way in life.

1676
01:28:34,120 --> 01:28:37,300
Nothing should ever interfere with fishing.

1677
01:28:39,940 --> 01:28:42,660
Guys, nothing should ever interfere with fishing.

1678
01:28:43,200 --> 01:28:44,260
Fishing is love.

1679
01:28:44,840 --> 01:28:45,800
Fishing is life.

1680
01:28:46,460 --> 01:28:53,020
The only love you can feel is your love of fucking... is your love for fish, guys.

1681
01:28:53,020 --> 01:28:55,280
But like, not in the creepy way though.

1682
01:28:55,360 --> 01:28:56,000
Not in the like...

1683
01:28:56,620 --> 01:28:57,940
Not in the fucked up type of way.

1684
01:28:58,040 --> 01:28:59,860
Just, you know, as a hobby or everything.

1685
01:29:00,140 --> 01:29:00,680
Okay, guys?

1686
01:29:01,360 --> 01:29:01,760
All right.

1687
01:29:02,220 --> 01:29:03,700
I guess it's a good way to call it here.

1688
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:04,400
That was fun.

1689
01:29:04,620 --> 01:29:06,900
I had a great time hanging out with everybody today.

1690
01:29:10,860 --> 01:29:11,660
It was...

1691
01:29:11,660 --> 01:29:13,740
It was really fun hanging out with everybody.

1692
01:29:14,060 --> 01:29:14,460
Just...

1693
01:29:14,460 --> 01:29:19,740
just relaxing and chatting and showing you guys some sneak peeks of like...

1694
01:29:20,540 --> 01:29:25,160
projects that are being worked on right now and like things that are being worked on.

1695
01:29:25,220 --> 01:29:26,340
So I'm super excited.

1696
01:29:26,580 --> 01:29:27,530
I'm super excited to...

1697
01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:31,820
and hope that things are... I can release them soon.

1698
01:29:32,420 --> 01:29:33,260
But yes.

1699
01:29:34,220 --> 01:29:35,970
Remember Thursday is when...

1700
01:29:36,340 --> 01:29:40,060
ticket sales come out for my first 3D concert.

1701
01:29:40,860 --> 01:29:44,680
And I'm super excited about that too because it's gonna be my first 3D concert.

1702
01:29:44,800 --> 01:29:47,480
I'm gonna be doing dance lessons and singing lessons for it.

1703
01:29:47,480 --> 01:29:51,300
So I can make sure to give you guys the performance you all deserve.

1704
01:29:52,040 --> 01:29:55,180
And it won't be... so it won't be too embarrassing for you guys to watch.

1705
01:29:55,320 --> 01:29:56,860
You guys won't get secondhand embarrassment.

1706
01:30:01,140 --> 01:30:02,040
But yeah.

1707
01:30:02,820 --> 01:30:05,040
I hope you guys all have a great night.

1708
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:07,420
And y'all rest up.

1709
01:30:07,840 --> 01:30:11,700
Tomorrow is a collab with Limeo, Mint, and Snuffy.

1710
01:30:12,760 --> 01:30:14,980
We're gonna be playing fast food simulator.

1711
01:30:16,480 --> 01:30:17,000
So...

1712
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:20,240
Seeing what our lives would have been if we didn't become streamers.

1713
01:30:20,300 --> 01:30:21,040
Hey guys!

1714
01:30:21,140 --> 01:30:23,800
As always, everybody stay hydrated.

1715
01:30:24,060 --> 01:30:24,680
Posture check.

1716
01:30:24,980 --> 01:30:26,760
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

1717
01:30:26,900 --> 01:30:29,000
And if you stay up for me, head to bed!

1718
01:30:29,280 --> 01:30:30,640
Cause you deserve it.

1719
01:30:30,840 --> 01:30:32,200
I'll see you guys next time everybody.

1720
01:30:32,660 --> 01:30:33,520
Bye guys.

1721
01:30:33,980 --> 01:30:34,460
Bye!
