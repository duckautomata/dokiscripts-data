00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:33,430
I didn't even pull up any of my applications.

11
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:36,690
I didn't boot up the game or anything in the last minute.

12
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:39,110
All right, it's 459.

13
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:41,110
I can boot up everything in one minute.

14
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:41,850
Let's go.

15
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:46,970
Oh, my God.

16
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:49,050
There's so many things.

17
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:50,090
And I have to pack it.

18
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:59,630
Oh my gosh, yesterday, I've been so busy yesterday, yes,
okay, so we have 60, recently, I don't know when I tweeted

19
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:09,630
this, but recently we received 60 giant packages of, like,
of debut dokeybird merch.

20
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:16,070
So 60 boxes, there's like barely space in my tiny apartment
right now.

21
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:20,250
So like, the lobby people called us and was like, hey.

22
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:31,130
we received a lot of packages and i was just like huh and i
was like oh shit and like it came in with like 30 so like 30

23
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:42,410
first and then and then like um and then more like 30 more
came and i was just like like i was just like oh my god

24
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:51,330
they're sick i did not i okay look we were told i ordered
we're told it was 60 boxes and we're told I was told 60

25
00:04:51,330 --> 00:05:07,130
boxes but I couldn't comprehend how many 60 was I couldn't I
couldn't comprehend how many 60 boxes actually was because I

26
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:16,290
was like oh that's not that much right because I lost my
sense of like how many people is alive so so I was like

27
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:19,350
Like, ah, 60 is not that bad.

28
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:28,170
And then boxes kept coming into my apartment more and more
and more.

29
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:31,610
And I was just like, so I don't have a hallway anymore.

30
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:39,770
Um, and like, it's so bad that like, you know, where the,
when you walk in the pathway where the boxes are, there's

31
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:41,050
like barely light.

32
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:55,190
there is there is barely any light when you start walking
through the hallway because the boxes just tower above you

33
00:05:55,190 --> 00:06:08,430
and uh so i've been like slowly packaging them myself
yesterday so i like package like two yes okay i package two

34
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:15,070
because i have to organize the inventory and stuff like that
um you guys must be wondering why are you packaging them

35
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:37,450
yourself good question mom why am i packaging them so anyway
i'm slowly sorting and sorting it out with myself at the

36
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:52,070
moment anyway I hope to like I hope we can start shipping
them shipping them out uh next week well it's gonna be

37
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:59,570
slowly I'm so sorry if it's gonna be like if there is a
delay in the end I am so sorry I'll try to be more

38
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:08,250
transparent about it if there is gonna be a delay going
forward but I'm trying my best to like start uh to like uh

39
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:18,510
package them and sending them out bundles might take a bit
longer uh to do um because i don't think i ordered enough

40
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:29,510
packaging materials for for the bundles so i've like i
recently ordered more envelopes and stuff like that uh for

41
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:40,590
the for all the merch and uh and um but i can start shipping
the smaller stuff like the people who order the smaller

42
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:47,410
things because i have enough of that of that but like for
the bundles and stuff it there might there might be a little

43
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:54,370
delay for the bundles just a little bit i hope but if it
does end up being a longer delay i'll try to be transparent

44
00:07:54,370 --> 00:08:01,790
with you guys i'll give you guys updates about it so time to
rent i thought i had a warehouse i like gate okay like

45
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:11,690
that's why i was like i'm gonna start like being more on top
of things because i was so busy of the stuff uh to my

46
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:19,190
parents because they said they wanted to work on that for me
and then so I thought I had a warehouse until I got 60

47
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:36,510
packages sent to my apartment and I was like where's the
distributor I was like I thought this is gonna be sent to a

48
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:51,330
distributor and then and then i was like so so i was like i
guess i'm the warehouse now i don't know what's going on

49
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:59,810
that's why i don't know what's going on at the moment but i
don't want to be like late with orders um so yeah my

50
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:07,290
apartment's the distributor my apartment's the warehouse for
now So like I'm trying to be like on top of like there's a

51
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:14,730
lot of things going on So like I'm trying to be like super
on top not like okay I can't say I'm on top of everything

52
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:17,690
when my apartment is literally the warehouse right

53
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:30,670
But it's been pretty rough because like I'm doing like
hundreds of jobs at once every day And I'm hoping that next

54
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:43,370
week when I have my actual break break that like everything
is um everything is like uh i guess like settled or like

55
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:51,390
finally organized um and like i'm actually looking i'm
currently also okay i'm like doing so many things i'm

56
00:09:51,390 --> 00:10:00,470
actually currently looking for a place for myself like to
live on my own technically like i used to live on my own and

57
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:06,530
then like uh and then my parents started living with me i

with me um but like i'm to like starting yesterday i've been

59
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:21,410

um independent and then i guess like use my part my other

60
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:35,790
this apartment as a warehouse i guess because and like i
will have to pay like two rents but that's I'm thankful for

62
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:46,110
be paying for two rents.

63
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:55,910
I'm not buying a place because like in Despite the amount of
support you guys have given me like the housing the house

64
00:10:55,910 --> 00:11:02,170
The real estate the real estate market in Canada is fucking
terrible.

65
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:02,870

70
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:44,290
fair that's never that's not as much as my dad he's been
playing this game for like two for like two to three years

71
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:51,350
non-stop every day so like since it got launched sometimes
he goes back to it like ever so often so like the intro of

72
00:11:51,350 --> 00:12:00,350
fallout 4 is like fucking ingrained in my head because i've
seen him replay the intro he created numerous characters um

73
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:07,250
multiple I feel like every time I see him play Fallout 4,
it's a new character, so like I fucking know the intro by

74
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:07,770
heart.

75
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:12,230
Thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

76
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:18,890
Thank you, thank you, thank you, let's say this to the
docast, but yeah the housing market.

77
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:20,770
Thank you for the super chat, thank you.

78
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:29,330
But yeah, I am really, I, oh my gosh, I haven't like looked
for my own place for so long.

79
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:36,890
I think for like I think like for a very long time since I
guess like since you know since like Oh my gosh, I don't

80
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:46,850
remember I have like usually like um I don't have to look
for myself uh, but like I don't even know if I hope like I

81
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:54,910
hope like my my future landlords if I see a place and I
don't have to compete with like 50 other people like i'm

82
00:12:54,910 --> 00:13:03,110
pretty sure i'm gonna have to compete with 50 plus other
people and then like i i feel like if they find out i have a

83
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:14,530
dog they'll be like no the hardest part is finding a pet
friendly apartment to rent as well and that's like the

84
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:23,190
hardest part because usually landlords would be like no pet
the bet like the better the bet the bet the better you are

85
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:25,710
as in like you know pets quiet

86
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:44,530
uh good credit uh no noise complaints oh fuck i need to find
a place that has like that has good that has thick wall i i

87
00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:53,770
know that like some places they'll be like um if you they'll
have like 50 plus uh people applicants they'll have 50 plus

88
00:13:53,770 --> 00:14:03,150
applicants and then and then they'll choose the one with
zero no pets uh not you know i guess like sometimes they

89
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:10,570
prefer university students because they are like university
students that study and like no they won't party or anything

90
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:18,770
because like that was me i remember like as a university
student I was like the go-to client like the go-to applicant

91
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:26,970
I was basically the dream applicant the dream tenant for so
many landlords like every time I applied for like a place

92
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:35,310
because at that time I didn't have like Doki Amber Doge so
like they'll be like oh my god she has no pets she's by

93
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:37,370
herself she's alone

94
00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:47,490
she obviously only studies like look at her she doesn't
party

95
00:14:52,970 --> 00:15:06,310
and and she's just she's she seems like a like a good person
so every time i remember in the past i would apply for a

96
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:13,250
place i'll be like i instantly get it like i don't think
i've ever been rejected for a place just because in

97
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:20,010
university i was like a university student and but like i
had like all the good traits of a university student like

98
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:34,250
and like i was able to afford um like a decent place i guess
like quote unquote decent place for like a single person so

99
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:44,170
like so then they'll like oh and by back then i didn't
stream as well so there was zero noise complaints i i also

100
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:52,770
did not stream so i had zero noise complaints so they're
like geez perfect i remember one time i like try to i i

101
00:15:52,770 --> 00:16:00,050
actually like i was actually looking at several places and
had several landlords trying to compete for me as a tenant

102
00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:08,750
it's that is that fucking crazy like like one was like um a
basement like what was it called like a basement suite so

103
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:14,510
like there was a family that was living you know the family
was renting out their their basement suite and the other one

104
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:26,170
was an apartment and um and then like obviously i'm sorry to
the family to the family in the i'm sorry to the family in

105
00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:33,910
the basement suite but i rejected the basement suite because
like like there was a They had a little baby.

106
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:43,790
They had a baby.

107
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:45,350
And I was like, oh no.

108
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:48,970
Will that be considered like a free babysitter for them in
the future?

109
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:54,930
They were in like the suburbia.

110
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:56,230
They were in suburbia too.

111
00:16:56,370 --> 00:16:57,430
So I was just like, oh no.

112
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:59,250
I have to walk to the bus stop.

113
00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:00,630
Instead of like going.

114
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:08,450
like I have to walk several blocks to get to the bus stop to
like get to my university but like you know the other one

115
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:14,570
the bus stop was like you know it was at an apartment at a
decent place so it was like I just have to walk like maybe

116
00:17:14,570 --> 00:17:23,210
like three minutes to the bus stop to get to my university
so I was like no I'm sorry but then like the app the

117
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:34,770
landlord for the basement suite they like sent me like
several emails to convince me They sent me like several

118
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:43,050
emails to like convince me to choose them as like their lad
like to choose them to write.

119
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:45,470
They're like we think you're the perfect tenant.

120
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:47,730
Like how's the application going?

121
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:53,870
Cause like they're like, oh we need like it's just like it's
the rules you need to fill out this application and stuff

122
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:54,290
like that.

123
00:17:54,570 --> 00:18:00,550
And they sent me like like two email two to three emails
being like oh what do you think like we really think you're

124
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:07,690
the perfect tenant for us like we really want you to rent
our place like oh how's the how's the application going on i

125
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:16,770
felt so sad i was like oh i'm sorry i found another place
that like suits me better even the and then the apartment

126
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:25,470
tenant also was like oh we think you're the perfect tent
like i literally just did like one i just went to one um i

127
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:31,810
went to like one like you know where you have to like look
around the apartment and then just like talk like just talk

128
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:39,150
to them and just be like what your thoughts are and stuff
and after that they'll be like uh after that they'll be like

129
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:47,890
oh i think you're per like i think we will uh i think like
the apartment guy was like right after the interview and

130
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:54,550
like looking around the apartment they were like oh yeah
like we think we want you to be the tenant like the open

131
00:18:54,550 --> 00:19:01,630
house yeah yeah yeah the open house because like they like
right after the open house they were like oh yeah yeah we

132
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:08,210
want you to be our tenant like yeah we're not gonna look at
the other other applicants anymore and i was like oh okay

133
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:21,430
yeah i think this is a good place make them it's gonna make
them funny i think it's also because like i've you know how

134
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:32,490
okay so um i'm like the ideal tenant because like The reason
why I'm the ideal tenant is because like I write my checks

135
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:33,570
in advance.

136
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:42,170
So basically like I just give them like six months of checks
in advance and be like, so I don't have to keep up with it.

137
00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:44,950
So I don't, I don't.

138
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:52,690
So I just be like, okay, like, like you don't have to chase
me for rent.

139
00:19:55,250 --> 00:20:04,230
I was just like, I was just, like I pays on time doesn't
party like just doesn't did stream at that time so I had no

140
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:12,210
noise complaints um and then I'll just be like okay here's
like here's some checks in advance so like you know I'm

141
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:21,230
pretty I hope I have the money by then but like I know I
don't see like I think I have the money by then when you

142
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:27,490
deposit these checks every month but you don't have to pay
you don't have to chase me in advance like

143
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:43,250
okay anyway but yeah so so i hope that's the same because
it's different now it's different now i have a dog so i have

144
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:55,130
a dog i i stream so there's gonna be noise complaints maybe
and it's like I'm just like oh man and it's so people people

145
00:20:55,130 --> 00:21:02,110
don't fucking buy houses here We all fucking rent because
the housing market is fucking terrible in Canada I don't

146
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:05,330
know how it can get worse, but it did I remember five years
ago.

147
00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:15,560
I was like how can this get worse and then it still gets
worse Like it's still buying houses can still go up Did we

148
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:18,380
not learn anything from the first financial crisis?

149
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:22,700
Like did we not learn anything from?

150
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:27,240
the first housing crash i don't know but it's back up again

151
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:41,160
um yeah and anyway and anyway i hope i'm still the ideal
tenant because like i've been like looking around for places

152
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:48,240
to like to see like where i could rent it's so hard it's so
difficult because like i i have like so many other factors

153
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:56,840
now that i i'm like a streamer like a content have a fucking
pet so there's so many factors to look into now when it

154
00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:06,640
comes to like uh when it comes to finding a place because
finding a pet friendly place is so difficult it's so fucking

155
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:24,760
difficult anyway anyway everybody sorry for the 23 minute
tangent guys but let's play the game up for it's time i'm

Wait, okay.

165

I see my cursor on the other monitor.

166
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,080
Ooh, okay, give me a sec, guys.

167
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:30,420
I gotta figure out where my cursor went.

168
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,120
Oh, Bethesda.

169
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:37,100
Bethesda, Bethesda.

170
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,660
Alright, guys, let me restart the game.

171
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,220
I don't know where my cursor went.

172
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:44,620
I was like, where did it go?

173
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:47,980
It just works.

174
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,300
It just works.

175
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:53,240
Okay, here we go.

176
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,100
Here we go.

177
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:57,820
Alright, play.

178
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,700
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

179
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:03,440
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

180
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,320
Part 6, what makes you special?

181
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:08,500
What makes me special?

182
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:09,240
Whoa!

183
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,500
That's a nuclear bomb.

184
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:12,560
Total atomic

185
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:25,130
uneducational materials for you to better understand.

186
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:30,470
I don't have a controller plugged in.

187
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:32,010
What do you mean?

188
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:34,310
Agility!

189
00:24:36,730 --> 00:24:45,030
A nuclear blast and the subsequent fallout will have many
adverse effects on life as we know it.

190
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:56,310
Intensive prolonged radiation exposure may transform into
decrepit rotting beings that have lost their ability to

191
00:24:56,310 --> 00:25:04,450
reason i bet someone would still want to bang that though
not me of course not me

192
00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:16,270
yeah me straps

193
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:37,770
yeah me especially after this show oh somebody here really
liked the ghoul can also help you out in difficult whoa who

194
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:49,730
needs agility if I go all attack I don't need agility if I
shoot the head okay we're never doing stealth by the way

195
00:25:49,730 --> 00:26:02,000
guys into a complete tactical move keep in mind exactly no
need to dodge if they're dead

196
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:15,090
Your agility will help you move through the wasteland with
ease and yield other benefits like assaulting an

197
00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:19,150
unsuspecting dreamer for the in hastily reloading your fire.

198
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:19,590
What?

199
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:28,110
By piling on damage to additional targets when the regularly
study your vault tech provided materials to prepare for

200
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:28,870
survival.

201
00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:29,710
Them.

202
00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:34,410
And to answer the question, do you know what makes you
special?

203
00:26:35,810 --> 00:26:36,790
I do!

204
00:26:38,050 --> 00:26:39,110
Because I'm anime.

205
00:26:39,910 --> 00:26:41,110
Alright, there you go.

206
00:26:41,530 --> 00:26:42,270
Where's my cursor?

207
00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:47,890
What the fuck?

208
00:26:48,730 --> 00:26:50,350
I did all of that!

209
00:26:50,730 --> 00:26:52,310
Where the fuck's my cursor?

210
00:26:54,190 --> 00:26:58,010
Okay, I'm gonna plug in my controller and see if it finds my
cursor.

211
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:01,750
I can't.

212
00:27:02,090 --> 00:27:03,610
Where the fuck's my cursor?

213
00:27:06,430 --> 00:27:08,510
I can't believe it.

214
00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:14,670
I watched all that and my cursor still didn't fucking show
up.

215
00:27:15,610 --> 00:27:19,250
I am pressing enter chat.

216
00:27:19,650 --> 00:27:20,810
I pressed enter.

217
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:22,230
Sorry, another flicker.

218
00:27:24,990 --> 00:27:28,750
Guys, I'm pressing space and enter.

219
00:27:29,670 --> 00:27:31,170
I don't understand.

220
00:27:35,810 --> 00:27:39,370
Oh my god, it just works.

221
00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:40,450
It just works.

222
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:46,150
Okay, guys, give me a sec.

223
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:47,210
I'm gonna Google this.

224
00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:51,410
Where is my cursor?

225
00:27:51,910 --> 00:27:54,250
It fall out for.

226
00:27:55,130 --> 00:27:58,190
Okay, disappearing is likely due to...

227
00:27:58,190 --> 00:27:59,110
Okay, it's not!

228
00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:00,790
I don't have it!

229
00:28:01,290 --> 00:28:02,010
Nope, okay.

230
00:28:02,570 --> 00:28:03,350
Turns out...

231
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:05,090
Okay, but it doesn't!

232
00:28:08,410 --> 00:28:16,930
go into the settings and turn off controller i think it
falls under that's how most games have my controller's not

233
00:28:16,930 --> 00:28:31,350

All right, now I plugged it back in.

243
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:58,600
Maybe if I just had my controller on, it will be fine.

244
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:00,180
I already have my controller on.

245
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:01,180

00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:30,200
I'm trying to plug back in my controller.

306
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,560
I can't fucking fit in the USB slot.

307
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:34,100
Everything's going wrong.

308
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:38,800
Oh my god.

309
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,040
Why can't that?

310
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:41,700
Why doesn't it fit in the hole?

311
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:43,820
Oh, that's what you want to hear.

312
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:46,460
Oh no.

313
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:48,640
Now I have nothing.

314
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:53,100
Okay.

315
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:54,080
Guys.

316
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:58,240
Okay, guys, this is starting to be a little bit of a mess,
guys.

317
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:05,840
I understand that now I can't even, apparently now I can't
even turn it back on.

318
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:06,980
Guys, I fucked up.

319
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:12,720
Why did I turn off the controller?

320
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:14,760
I fucked up.

321
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:18,440
I can't even use the controller anymore.

322
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,540
Oh, my God.

323
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:24,220
I fucked up.

324
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:40,580
I won't even let me use the controller because I turned it
off Oh no Guys Guys I realized I made a mistake when I

325
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:51,260
turned off controller It's oh I'm actually broken Wait maybe
it didn't register Maybe it just didn't register guys

326
00:35:55,140 --> 00:36:05,720
Maybe he didn't Don't wait This is all Todd's plan Todd
knows what he's doing I believe Oh I knew it I knew I could

00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:33,000
Oh, this is, oh my God, does this work?

333
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:39,660
Todd, don't, no, don't buy, don't pay for those mods.

334
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:42,440
But that's what Todd wants, though.

335
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:46,240
Todd wants me to pay for mods.

336
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:49,880
I can possibly listen, but this is amazing content.

337
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,380
Thank you, Super Chat, Mr. Broken Fond.

338
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:53,500
Thank you, thank you.

339
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:54,660
God!

340
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:59,280
Look, if Todd wants me to pay for mods, maybe he's right,
you know?

341
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,620
Maybe he's right.

342
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,000
Oh, these are free?

343
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:04,820
Oh, shit.

344
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:05,360
Okay.

345
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:12,080
I would pay Todd, just letting you know, if you monetize
your mods, I would definitely pay for them.

346
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:21,720
Me and all the Todd believers would 100% pay for it.

347
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:29,320
Anyway, I can't believe I have to play this on...

348
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:32,000
I can't believe I have to play this on controller.

349
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:34,200
Start a new game.

350
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:34,740
Yes.

351
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,840
Don't give it to all two of you.

352
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:40,260
Todd, do it.

353
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:41,620
It'll be so funny.

354
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:44,560
Okay.

355
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:47,240
Maybe...

356
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:51,120
Guys, maybe like my mouse cursor will show up.

357
00:37:51,580 --> 00:37:52,120
Guys.

358
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:54,160
Just as he...

359
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,580
Just as attended.

360
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:56,820
Entirely trust.

361
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:58,540
TV.

362
00:37:58,800 --> 00:37:59,520
Thank you for the super chat.

363
00:37:59,740 --> 00:37:59,900
Thank you.

364
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:00,400
Thank you.

365
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:04,920
If he can get away with Starfield, he can get away with paid
much.

366
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:08,260
War.

367
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:12,880
Never changes.

368
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:15,280
He said the thing.

369
00:38:21,650 --> 00:38:23,010
In the year 1945.

370
00:38:25,110 --> 00:38:26,430
My great-great-grandfather.

371
00:38:28,390 --> 00:38:37,670
in the army, wondered when he'd get to go home to his wife
and the son he'd never seen.

372
00:38:40,210 --> 00:38:48,710
He got his wish when the US ended World War II by dropping
atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

373
00:38:51,330 --> 00:38:52,810
The world awaited Armageddon.

374
00:38:55,150 --> 00:39:06,870
Instead, something more miraculous happened we began to use
atomic energy not as a weapon but as a nearly limitless

375
00:39:06,870 --> 00:39:14,530
source of power oh my god we did it luxuries once thought
the realm of science fiction surely no one would use it for

376
00:39:14,530 --> 00:39:25,030
bad fusion powered cars portable computers and then the
world and then we discovered world peace right right 21st

377
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:31,710
century What the fuck give this kid a knife?

378
00:39:32,290 --> 00:39:35,490
Years of consumption led to shortages of every major
resource.

379
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:42,810
Subtitles, look, I forgot to turn subtitles on because I was
going through a lot.

380
00:39:47,050 --> 00:39:48,090
It's understandable.

381
00:39:48,350 --> 00:39:51,010
It went through like the five stages of grief just then.

382
00:39:51,710 --> 00:39:52,790

00:45:59,150 --> 00:46:00,570
Oh, shit!

427
00:46:01,970 --> 00:46:02,710
Okay.

428
00:46:06,550 --> 00:46:07,450
Okay, wait, wait.

429
00:46:08,650 --> 00:46:14,410
Guys, as I said in 76, guys, it's all about...

430
00:46:14,410 --> 00:46:24,770
Look, the more arm muscle you have, the more attractive you
are in the waistline, chat.

431
00:46:25,970 --> 00:46:34,350
it's all about that muscle they'll hire me because they'll
be like oh shit we need that muscle ginger diamond thank you

432
00:46:34,350 --> 00:46:45,210
super chat thank you we're dying up yes you guys I told you
in the 76 stream I told you um the because like having

433
00:46:45,210 --> 00:46:52,870
having like red hair is like a recessive trait and
apparently there's been like apparently like it's starting

434
00:46:52,870 --> 00:47:00,850
to like be phased out the longer the more years have passed
it's starting to be phased out more and more and more so so

435
00:47:00,850 --> 00:47:09,410
there's like eventually there's gonna be no more gingers
which is so fucked up to think about it's actually it's

436
00:47:09,410 --> 00:47:17,530
because it's like having red hair is a mutation same with
blue eyes uh having blue eyes is a genetic mutation along

437
00:47:17,530 --> 00:47:24,530
with red hair and they're both like considered recessive
genes so like if like obviously if like somebody with like

438
00:47:24,530 --> 00:47:34,990
different colored eyes or colored hair was, you know, got,
like if their wife, husband had like a different color eyes

439
00:47:34,990 --> 00:47:44,870
or hair that's not red hair or red hair or like blue eyes
usually the kids will not have those traits.

440
00:47:45,690 --> 00:47:54,710
So that's why like that's why like gingers are slowly being
phased out because it's a recessive gene.

441
00:47:57,190 --> 00:48:00,110
She called me a mutant

442
00:48:03,190 --> 00:48:12,390
Because to keep the bloodline going for gingers You have to
like You have to like marry another ginger Or like have kids

443
00:48:12,390 --> 00:48:21,230
with another ginger To guarantee red hair But like obviously
like If you do that too long Then we have an issue of

444
00:48:21,230 --> 00:48:26,510
inbreeding So we don't want that We don't want Wait, okay,
wait.

445
00:48:27,150 --> 00:48:28,130
The husband needs...

446
00:48:28,130 --> 00:48:28,930
I just realized.

447
00:48:29,410 --> 00:48:29,890
The husband.

448
00:48:32,830 --> 00:48:35,150
The husband needs to...

449
00:48:35,150 --> 00:48:36,250
Uh...

450
00:48:36,250 --> 00:48:38,850
They're not dying at recesses.

451
00:48:39,010 --> 00:48:41,310
You don't stop existing until there's...

452
00:48:41,310 --> 00:48:44,130
Well, they're like slowly getting phased out.

453
00:48:44,290 --> 00:48:46,510
And so, they're rare and rare.

454
00:48:47,310 --> 00:48:48,410
It's true.

455
00:48:49,390 --> 00:48:50,990
They're rare and rare.

456
00:48:51,210 --> 00:48:52,290
Okay, wait, sound guy.

457
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:53,670
Uh...

458
00:48:53,670 --> 00:48:55,110
All right.

459
00:48:55,450 --> 00:48:57,450
Sorry, I need to...

460
00:49:00,210 --> 00:49:00,870
Okay.

461
00:49:01,890 --> 00:49:03,390
So we know why he died.

462
00:49:06,830 --> 00:49:13,490
I may be a lawyer, but it doesn't stop me from getting these
games.

463
00:49:13,950 --> 00:49:14,610
There we go.

525
00:55:27,410 --> 00:55:40,670
nuclear bomb joki joki never changes gone to heck in a
handbasket if you'll excuse my language the big kaboom is

526
00:55:40,670 --> 00:55:52,030
it's inevitable i'm afraid and coming sooner than you may
think if you catch my meaning but how would you know huh so

527
00:55:52,030 --> 00:56:00,410
i won't take up much of your time yeah you're you're
encroaching on my gym time precious commodity i'm here today

528
00:56:00,410 --> 00:56:09,550
to tell you that because of your family service to our
country you have been pre-selected for entrance into the

529
00:56:09,550 --> 00:56:21,330
local vault vault one i've been pre-selected wait what
enough space i don't need if you can fit us all right god i

530
00:56:21,330 --> 00:56:28,870
look good of course why don't you have to pay for it minus
your robot naturally in fact you're already cleared for

531
00:56:28,870 --> 00:56:36,830
entrance it's just a matter of verifying some information i
thought you had to pay hold-ups in the unforeseen event of

532
00:56:36,830 --> 00:56:48,410
total atomic annihilation won't take but a moment wait tell
me more tell me more it's like a pyramid scheme and i'm all

533
00:56:48,410 --> 00:56:55,970
for it pyramid schemes are not a scam because you don't
because if you get to the top

534
00:56:59,830 --> 00:57:04,130
it's not a scam you just don't make it you just don't know
how to work how it works

535
00:57:08,150 --> 00:57:15,610
all I'm saying is that if you're at the middle tier of a
pyramid scheme or like the higher the tier you are in the

536
00:57:15,610 --> 00:57:29,130
pyramid scheme the more money you make so it's not my so
it's your fault if you don't make any okay all right sorry

537
00:57:29,130 --> 00:57:36,050
it's not a scamming at the top That's the spirit.

538
00:57:36,590 --> 00:57:38,150
That's Lucy.

539
00:57:39,350 --> 00:57:40,070

Um, the strongest lawyer there is.

00:58:08,390 --> 00:58:10,410
Don't use my brains as a lawyer.

549
00:58:10,510 --> 00:58:13,490
They're just fully intimidated at that point.

550
00:58:14,330 --> 00:58:16,190
Okay, um, what else is good?

We're in the vault!

600
01:00:29,690 --> 01:00:32,190
For you and Sean, no price is too high.

601
01:00:33,110 --> 01:00:34,050
Good answer.

602
01:00:34,150 --> 01:00:35,430
I have my moments.

603
01:00:37,430 --> 01:00:38,360
All right, here you go.

604
01:00:39,410 --> 01:00:40,750
Cosworth, can you say my name?

605
01:00:46,540 --> 01:00:48,180
Don't worry, Cogsworth.

606
01:00:49,160 --> 01:00:50,230
Mama's here.

607
01:00:52,560 --> 01:00:53,240
Hey, Cosworth.

608
01:00:57,560 --> 01:01:01,440
A little motherly love to quiet the nerves.

609
01:01:02,500 --> 01:01:03,500
Don't worry.

610
01:01:04,420 --> 01:01:07,020
Mama's here to love my child.

611
01:01:12,940 --> 01:01:14,120
Hello, Sean.

612
01:01:15,700 --> 01:01:18,300
My boy isn't giving me any trouble, is he?

613
01:01:18,680 --> 01:01:20,740
Hey, I fixed that mobile on his crib the other day.

614
01:01:21,240 --> 01:01:22,040
Why don't you give it a spin?

615
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:24,560
Oh yeah, I'll spin it.

616
01:01:24,860 --> 01:01:25,300
Yay!

617
01:01:25,700 --> 01:01:26,400
You see that?

618
01:01:26,780 --> 01:01:27,880
Those are rockets.

619
01:01:28,900 --> 01:01:32,320
And you'll never go to space because you're not smart
enough.

620
01:01:34,100 --> 01:01:36,340
Sean isn't gonna make it.

621
01:01:37,340 --> 01:01:40,440
After breakfast, I was thinking we could head to the park
for a bit.

622
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:41,610
Weather should hold up.

623
01:01:42,990 --> 01:01:43,980
And do what?

624
01:01:44,560 --> 01:01:44,780
What?

625
01:01:45,580 --> 01:01:46,100
And do what?

626
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:48,640
And do what exactly?

627
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:51,160
The fucking hell our neck.

628
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:53,240
What?

629
01:01:55,040 --> 01:01:56,380
Press E to shine.

630
01:01:57,220 --> 01:01:58,980
What is it, Cogsworth?

631
01:02:00,560 --> 01:02:02,940
Where's the bomb?

632
01:02:05,820 --> 01:02:06,580
Where's the bomb?

633
01:02:07,740 --> 01:02:08,380
Mushroom.

634
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:11,800

635
01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:13,880
What did he say?

636
01:02:15,060 --> 01:02:18,240
We do have...

637
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:18,920
We do have coming in.

638
01:02:19,100 --> 01:02:21,900
That's, um, confirmed reports.

639
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:26,020
I repeat confirmed reports of nuclear- Let's just sit here
and not do anything.

640
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:28,000
Can we die in the beginning?

641
01:02:28,620 --> 01:02:29,200
My god.

642
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:32,320
Oh no, it's happening.

643
01:02:33,160 --> 01:02:34,260
Please stand by.

644
01:02:34,780 --> 01:02:35,860
Who opened the door?

645
01:02:36,300 --> 01:02:37,640
Keep going!

646
01:02:38,180 --> 01:02:38,840

647
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:40,280

648
01:02:41,040 --> 01:02:42,820
There's ghosts here too?

649
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:49,120
Alright.

650
01:02:49,660 --> 01:02:53,900
I wonder if I can actually Todd from the fate of Todd
himself.

651
01:02:54,120 --> 01:02:55,040
He opened the door.

652
01:02:56,660 --> 01:02:57,700
Who cares?

653
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:02,240

654
01:03:02,380 --> 01:03:03,060

It should be, like, super low because you're in the power
army.

664
01:03:53,890 --> 01:03:55,970
What's going to happen to all those people outside the gate?

665
01:03:56,150 --> 01:03:56,990

666

674
01:04:14,110 --> 01:04:15,810
When will the nuclear bomb drop?

675
01:04:17,710 --> 01:04:18,530
It'll be fun.

676
01:04:21,030 --> 01:04:22,390
Oh, that's just the show.

677
01:04:22,590 --> 01:04:24,050

01:04:24,830 --> 01:04:25,290

01:04:28,970 --> 01:04:30,210

alarm I literally have 10 durability Like 10 on strength And

691
01:05:15,350 --> 01:05:17,370
I just need a radiation part.

692
01:05:21,790 --> 01:05:24,330
Wait, can you actually explore the town?

693
01:05:24,870 --> 01:05:25,610
Oh, my God.

694
01:05:25,710 --> 01:05:27,470
What if I just explore the town?

695
01:05:28,090 --> 01:05:30,430
I've never actually explored the town before.

696
01:05:30,950 --> 01:05:33,630
I feel like it let me because it's scripted.

697
01:05:33,930 --> 01:05:35,290
Why don't they let us in?

698
01:05:38,510 --> 01:05:49,230

01:06:22,270 --> 01:06:22,330
Yay!

712
01:06:23,730 --> 01:06:25,330
I mean, they have power armor.

713
01:06:25,430 --> 01:06:26,230
They'll be fine.

714
01:06:32,310 --> 01:06:33,710
How was I supposed to know?

715
01:06:33,770 --> 01:06:35,810
I thought it was just a government hoax.

716
01:06:36,450 --> 01:06:37,950
It was a fear tactic.

717
01:06:38,550 --> 01:06:39,090
We did it.

718
01:06:40,690 --> 01:06:41,190

Oh my god, you made a suit in my size?

731
01:07:51,810 --> 01:07:58,930
It's so difficult finding a shirt that doesn't rip because
of these guns.

732
01:08:01,950 --> 01:08:03,170
Oh, you're going to love it here.

733
01:08:03,590 --> 01:08:05,910
This is one of our most advanced facilities.

734
01:08:06,530 --> 01:08:08,190
Not that the others aren't great, mind you.

735
01:08:08,510 --> 01:08:09,090
It's gone.

736
01:08:09,730 --> 01:08:10,230
Our home.

737
01:08:10,790 --> 01:08:11,750
Everything we had.

738
01:08:11,910 --> 01:08:12,270
Yeah, but it's...

739
01:08:12,290 --> 01:08:13,910
It's better down here.

740
01:08:14,790 --> 01:08:16,390
We get free food and entertainment.

741
01:08:16,590 --> 01:08:18,630
You'll never have to work again.

742
01:08:19,090 --> 01:08:21,550
Oh, we'll be going over all that in orientation.

743
01:08:22,410 --> 01:08:24,570
Just a few medical items we have to get through first.

744
01:08:24,910 --> 01:08:26,930
Welcome to the gun show.

745
01:08:29,530 --> 01:08:30,770
Oh, this is...

746
01:08:30,770 --> 01:08:31,670
Where's my new home?

747
01:08:32,230 --> 01:08:33,170
I hope you'll see this.

748
01:08:33,250 --> 01:08:34,810
Oh my god, we're gonna get Disneyed.

749
01:08:37,030 --> 01:08:37,710
Excuse me.

750
01:08:38,310 --> 01:08:40,930
Just step in here and put your vault suit on.

751
01:08:41,110 --> 01:08:41,430
Alright.

752
01:08:42,290 --> 01:08:43,250
In front of everybody?

753
01:08:43,650 --> 01:08:45,130
I mean, I'm not shy or anything.

754
01:08:48,130 --> 01:08:51,050
I'm very confident about my body.

755
01:08:57,010 --> 01:08:58,930
I worked hard for it.

756
01:08:59,730 --> 01:09:04,650
The pod will decontaminate and depressurize you before we
head deeper in the wall.

757
01:09:05,330 --> 01:09:07,370
Thank you for a whole new life.

758
01:09:08,310 --> 01:09:09,990
Did I change?

759
01:09:10,210 --> 01:09:12,190
Do I keep her in front of Swalton?

760
01:09:12,290 --> 01:09:14,210
Thank you for the super chat, Tom.

761
01:09:14,450 --> 01:09:14,590

01:09:14,870 --> 01:09:15,330
Thank you.

763
01:09:21,020 --> 01:09:23,820
Oh, shit.

764
01:09:24,060 --> 01:09:27,440
I look down instead of at my husband and child.

765
01:09:42,460 --> 01:09:42,940
Don't worry.

766
01:09:43,080 --> 01:09:45,200
Don't unfreeze me like don't unfreeze Disney.

767
01:09:56,420 --> 01:09:56,480
Hello?

768
01:09:57,680 --> 01:09:58,440
Oh, my gosh.

769
01:09:58,520 --> 01:09:59,480
I'm looking up again.

770
01:10:00,220 --> 01:10:02,000
That my husband?

771
01:10:10,490 --> 01:10:13,610
Oh my god, we're going to be let go early.

772
01:10:16,090 --> 01:10:17,970
Is it time to repopulate the world?

773
01:10:18,350 --> 01:10:19,590
Are we going to the surface?

774
01:10:32,060 --> 01:10:33,360
Give him the child!

775
01:10:34,020 --> 01:10:35,780
His fucking arms are sticks!

776
01:10:35,900 --> 01:10:37,660
How can you not pull off the child?

777
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:43,700
Oh, he's dead.

778
01:10:50,130 --> 01:11:05,410
John I'm the backup Look, I'm all I'm saying If my husband
Invest in 10 points in strength That wouldn't have happened

779
01:11:10,030 --> 01:11:17,170
That's all I'm saying He invested in the wrong thing If he
was a fucking lawyer He could have survived.

780
01:11:21,320 --> 01:11:22,820
I'm only a plan B.

781
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:23,840
I can't believe it.

782
01:11:23,940 --> 01:11:26,640
I worked so hard on these guns.

783
01:11:29,200 --> 01:11:29,580
Oh.

784
01:11:34,250 --> 01:11:35,290
He could have taken...

785
01:11:35,290 --> 01:11:35,410
Exactly.

786
01:11:35,710 --> 01:11:37,230
He could have taken the bullet.

787
01:11:37,850 --> 01:11:39,270
Because I might...

788
01:11:39,270 --> 01:11:39,810

Almost murdered Stanley for dropping a damn saltcracker on
the floor.

823
01:14:23,490 --> 01:14:26,470
A handful of us confronted the overseer about opening up the
vault.

824
01:14:26,830 --> 01:14:29,850
I never knew a man that small could shout that loud.

825
01:14:30,250 --> 01:14:34,030
Now he's locked himself in this office along with the rest
of the side staff.

826
01:14:34,390 --> 01:14:40,230
We're supposed to hand over any food, weapons, and medicines
we have by tonight, or there's going to be consequences.

An absence of an all-clear message from Vault-Tec.

834
01:15:22,650 --> 01:15:25,990
The overseer may like to evacuate staff after a mandatory
shelter.

835
01:15:26,530 --> 01:15:26,930
They left.

836
01:15:26,990 --> 01:15:28,990

Still can't eat yet.

01:20:20,120 --> 01:20:21,240
It's this way.

01:20:21,500 --> 01:20:22,480

933
01:20:52,020 --> 01:20:52,560
That's why.

934
01:20:52,680 --> 01:20:53,820
Do I not have a pit boy?

935
01:20:54,640 --> 01:20:54,860

This button is reserved.

941
01:21:02,160 --> 01:21:03,360
What is it reserved for?

942
01:21:04,100 --> 01:21:06,060
I don't have it reserved for anything.

943
01:21:06,320 --> 01:21:06,840
Oh.

944
01:21:07,800 --> 01:21:08,320
Oh.

945
01:21:08,500 --> 01:21:09,020
Okay.

946
01:21:09,260 --> 01:21:09,920

947
01:21:09,940 --> 01:21:12,360

01:21:13,380 --> 01:21:13,780

950
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:14,400
Okay.

951
01:21:16,240 --> 01:21:18,740
I'm going to put that back in left.

952
01:21:18,900 --> 01:21:19,220
Oh.

953
01:21:19,820 --> 01:21:22,940
And then I'm gonna put that here.

954
01:21:24,120 --> 01:21:25,160
Wait, what's...

955
01:21:25,160 --> 01:21:26,440
Wait, I can't do it.

956
01:21:26,560 --> 01:21:27,560
It won't let me.

957
01:21:28,480 --> 01:21:29,040
No!

958
01:21:30,320 --> 01:21:31,860
It won't let me!

959
01:21:33,500 --> 01:21:33,980
Okay.

960
01:21:34,900 --> 01:21:36,160
I'm just gonna put it here then.

961
01:21:37,500 --> 01:21:38,340
I'm just not...

962
01:21:38,340 --> 01:21:40,520
I'm just gonna do it the other way.

963
01:21:44,620 --> 01:21:45,180
Smash!

964
01:21:45,760 --> 01:21:46,240
Oh, no.

965
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:48,180
A little bit of radiation doesn't hurt.

966
01:21:48,980 --> 01:21:49,540
It's fine.

967
01:21:49,620 --> 01:21:50,120
It's like...

968
01:21:50,120 --> 01:21:51,580
It's like eating a banana.

969
01:21:52,340 --> 01:21:53,440
I'm a little hydrated.

970
01:21:53,600 --> 01:21:54,680
Stay hydrated, everybody.

971
01:21:56,180 --> 01:21:57,040
Alright, I'm okay.

972
01:21:58,900 --> 01:21:59,420
Gun!

973
01:22:00,860 --> 01:22:01,780
This is it.

974
01:22:08,510 --> 01:22:09,430

Mutiny.

978
01:22:15,510 --> 01:22:16,450
I want to know about the mutiny.

979
01:22:17,130 --> 01:22:20,790
A faction led by the security personnel have turned on me.

980
01:22:21,070 --> 01:22:22,950
Demanding they be allowed to leave the vault.

981
01:22:23,270 --> 01:22:23,690
Idiots!

982
01:22:23,850 --> 01:22:26,950

the staff on lockdown we're going to have to start

been too damn generous with the rations if people don't like

985
01:22:40,810 --> 01:22:49,570

01:32:47,740 --> 01:32:49,420
Improved recoil and hip fire.

You might as well.

1138
01:32:50,340 --> 01:32:51,400
I have everything for it.

1139
01:32:51,800 --> 01:32:54,880
I should not be upgrading my default gun.

1140
01:32:56,240 --> 01:32:56,840
Never...

1141
01:33:00,960 --> 01:33:02,440
It's just a scratch.

1142
01:33:05,340 --> 01:33:05,640
Alright.

1143
01:33:06,180 --> 01:33:06,820
Let's see.

1144
01:33:19,280 --> 01:33:21,360
There's people using the radio.

1145
01:33:25,040 --> 01:33:25,740
Oh my god.

1146
01:33:25,840 --> 01:33:27,500
They know how to use the radio.

1147
01:33:28,460 --> 01:33:29,620
That's crazy.

1148
01:33:31,280 --> 01:33:31,640
Alright.

1149
01:33:32,060 --> 01:33:33,320
Oh my gosh, my neighbors.

1150
01:33:33,760 --> 01:33:35,420
Why are my neighbors so poor?

1151
01:33:35,620 --> 01:33:36,900
We live in suburbia.

1152
01:33:37,780 --> 01:33:38,940
Oh, nice bobby pins.

01:33:42,900 --> 01:33:44,780
There's no subtitles for radios, unfortunately.

1156
01:33:45,320 --> 01:33:47,340
Wait, have I turned off, like, motion blur?

1157
01:33:48,100 --> 01:33:48,880
I couldn't tell.

1158
01:33:51,780 --> 01:33:53,020
Gameplay, display.

1159
01:33:54,180 --> 01:33:55,080
Is there motion blur?

1160
01:33:55,260 --> 01:33:55,700
I don't know.

1161
01:33:55,780 --> 01:33:56,680
I think there isn't.

1162
01:33:58,800 --> 01:33:59,760
It doesn't see.

1163
01:33:59,800 --> 01:34:00,600
Oh, there we go.

1164
01:34:00,780 --> 01:34:01,200
Wait, is it?

1165
01:34:01,200 --> 01:34:01,640
No, that's...

1166
01:34:01,660 --> 01:34:02,020
fade.

1167
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:04,760
I couldn't tell if there's motion blur.

1168
01:34:07,100 --> 01:34:11,160
Alright, let me like, I'm gonna, like, turn my sense a bit
lower, though.

1169
01:34:11,440 --> 01:34:12,880
The sense was way too high for me.

1170
01:34:15,080 --> 01:34:15,460
There you go.

1171
01:34:16,460 --> 01:34:16,900
Cogsworth!

1172
01:34:17,580 --> 01:34:18,460
You're live!

1173
01:34:20,120 --> 01:34:20,560
It's...

1174
01:34:20,560 --> 01:34:22,520
It's really you!

1175
01:34:23,500 --> 01:34:24,380
It's me!

1176
01:34:26,160 --> 01:34:27,040
Everything's dead!

1177
01:34:27,460 --> 01:34:29,720
We gotta, you know, like, we gotta give it to him straight.

1178
01:34:30,140 --> 01:34:30,780
My God.

1179
01:34:31,660 --> 01:34:32,720
They did it.

1180
01:34:33,920 --> 01:34:34,720
All that fighting.

1181
01:34:35,180 --> 01:34:35,740
And for what?

1182
01:34:37,180 --> 01:34:38,040
Everything's dead.

1183
01:34:38,560 --> 01:34:39,380
Everything's dead?

1184
01:34:40,040 --> 01:34:41,720
Ah, yes, the garden.

1185
01:34:42,300 --> 01:34:45,920
The posies have been problematic, I admit.

1186
01:34:46,840 --> 01:34:51,320
If only sir were here to help, where is he, by the by the
way?

1187
01:34:51,320 --> 01:34:52,660
He's fucking dead.

1188
01:34:53,740 --> 01:34:55,120
He can't be dead.

1189
01:34:56,340 --> 01:34:57,540
Okay, I'm going to be in denial.

1190
01:34:57,860 --> 01:34:58,620
He can't be.

1191
01:34:59,720 --> 01:35:00,880
He can't be.

1192
01:35:02,380 --> 01:35:05,340
Cogsworth, I'm going through the five stages of grief right
now.

1193
01:35:07,520 --> 01:35:09,580
We can both be in denial.

1194
01:35:16,520 --> 01:35:18,200
Wait, can we actually romance Cogsworth?

1195
01:35:18,600 --> 01:35:20,200
I know you can romance people in Fallout.

1196
01:35:20,480 --> 01:35:20,700
I know you can romance people in Fallout.

1197
01:35:20,700 --> 01:35:23,540
It's an attraction to calm this dire mood.

1198
01:35:24,380 --> 01:35:27,600
It's been ages since we've had a proper family activity.

1199
01:35:28,520 --> 01:35:31,160
Checkers or perhaps Shiraz.

1200
01:35:31,660 --> 01:35:33,680
Oh, Sean does so love that.

1201
01:35:39,080 --> 01:35:41,000
They stole him.

1202
01:35:41,300 --> 01:35:42,960
Sean's been kidnapped, Cogsworth.

1203
01:35:43,300 --> 01:35:44,300
Sean's been kidnapped.

1204
01:35:45,160 --> 01:35:46,420
I'm going to find him.

1205
01:35:47,680 --> 01:35:49,140
I'm going to get my baby back.

1206
01:35:49,520 --> 01:35:51,200
It's worse than I thought.

1207
01:35:52,600 --> 01:35:56,140
You're suffering from hunger-induced paranoia.

1208
01:35:56,280 --> 01:35:56,460
What?

1209
01:35:56,580 --> 01:35:57,900
From losing my son?

1210
01:35:58,300 --> 01:36:00,480
200 years will do that, I'm afraid.

1211
01:36:03,700 --> 01:36:04,920
I feel fine.

1212
01:36:05,280 --> 01:36:06,300
I don't know what you're talking about.

1213
01:36:07,480 --> 01:36:08,560
I feel fine.

1214
01:36:08,740 --> 01:36:10,500
Just a little bit of radiation.

1215
01:36:12,660 --> 01:36:15,900
I sort of like ate a little bit of Radroach meat, but it's
okay.

1216
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:16,920
It's like eating a banana.

1217
01:36:26,490 --> 01:36:28,050
He can make me food.

1218
01:36:29,250 --> 01:36:30,210
How do you have food?

1219
01:36:30,610 --> 01:36:31,270
Wait, you okay?

1220
01:36:31,610 --> 01:36:32,410
Why is it yellow?

1221
01:36:33,070 --> 01:36:34,850
People would withhold information.

1222
01:36:34,990 --> 01:36:37,470
You can attempt to persuade them into sharing boats.

1223
01:36:37,630 --> 01:36:38,350
Okay, you okay.

1224
01:36:38,450 --> 01:36:38,890
God's worth.

1225
01:36:39,030 --> 01:36:39,510
You're acting.

1238
01:38:53,550 --> 01:38:54,550
Where's the holotape?

1239
01:38:54,690 --> 01:38:56,030
Where do I look at that?

1240
01:38:56,850 --> 01:38:57,270
Radio.

01:39:14,770 --> 01:39:16,930
Why the fuck did you give me this tape?

1245
01:39:17,670 --> 01:39:20,010
I'm already going through trauma, Cogsworth!

1246
01:39:21,890 --> 01:39:23,330
Can I rob my own house?

1247
01:39:31,800 --> 01:39:32,300
Nice.

1248
01:39:32,700 --> 01:39:33,080
Nice.

1249
01:39:41,440 --> 01:39:43,420
Oh my god, please stop sitting on chairs.

1250
01:39:46,990 --> 01:39:48,590
I can't I can't believe it.

1251
01:39:49,370 --> 01:39:51,230
I'm coming, sweetheart.

1252
01:39:52,010 --> 01:39:53,010
Bro, he's fucking dead.

1253
01:39:53,170 --> 01:39:53,850
What do you mean?

1254
01:39:55,710 --> 01:39:59,550
I can't believe... I can't believe Cogsworth gave me more
trauma.

1255
01:39:59,710 --> 01:40:01,510
I was trying to fucking move on.

1256
01:40:02,010 --> 01:40:03,690
I don't understand Cogsworth.

1257
01:40:03,870 --> 01:40:05,370
Why would you do this to me?

1258
01:40:05,650 --> 01:40:07,490
After everything I've been through.

1259
01:40:10,130 --> 01:40:12,490
Feels fucking bad, mom.

1260
01:40:17,890 --> 01:40:19,370
All right, we gotta...

1261
01:40:19,370 --> 01:40:20,050
Oh, there's more?

1262
01:40:20,350 --> 01:40:21,250
Did I not loot everything?

1263
01:40:21,490 --> 01:40:22,430
Oh, wait, there is!

1264
01:40:22,990 --> 01:40:24,890
No, that is just a baby rattle.

1265
01:40:25,010 --> 01:40:25,610
That's money!

1266
01:40:25,930 --> 01:40:27,650
I can sell Sean's baby rattle.

1267
01:40:27,930 --> 01:40:32,670
I'm gonna sell everything that I've owned of Sean so, like,
I can move on.

1268
01:40:33,030 --> 01:40:34,030
That's so healthy.

1269
01:40:34,970 --> 01:40:37,210
As long as, like, I pretend he never existed.

1270
01:40:37,770 --> 01:40:38,450
I'll be okay.

1271
01:40:38,570 --> 01:40:40,850
I'll just sell every little reminder I have of him.

1272
01:40:41,670 --> 01:40:42,610
The books is on the...

1273
01:40:42,610 --> 01:40:43,950
Did I miss the book again?

1274
01:40:44,470 --> 01:40:45,130
Did I...

1275
01:40:46,290 --> 01:40:47,370

01:41:29,610 --> 01:41:30,730
I keep fucking sitting.

1284
01:41:31,950 --> 01:41:33,010
My legs are tired.

1285

Oh, God.

1289
01:41:38,930 --> 01:41:40,530
There's way too much radiation.

He's out there.

1328
01:44:19,310 --> 01:44:20,390
I need to find him.

02:03:23,220 --> 02:03:23,860
Error?

1685
02:03:25,640 --> 02:03:27,440
I'm so confused.

1686
02:03:29,460 --> 02:03:30,580
How many words were right?

1687
02:03:30,700 --> 02:03:32,980
Did it tell me how many words were right?

1688
02:03:35,200 --> 02:03:36,760
Wait, which one did I play?

1689
02:03:36,800 --> 02:03:37,980
Okay, I clicked could.

1690
02:03:38,860 --> 02:03:40,180
And it says one word.

1691
02:03:40,280 --> 02:03:41,020
How about over?

1692
02:03:41,040 --> 02:03:41,400
owner.

1693
02:03:42,540 --> 02:03:42,540
Zero.

1694
02:03:43,360 --> 02:03:43,620
Okay.

1695
02:03:44,040 --> 02:03:45,040
So it's not...

1696
02:03:47,860 --> 02:03:48,380
Um...

1697
02:03:48,380 --> 02:03:48,900
Okay.

1698
02:03:49,040 --> 02:03:50,660
So one letter was right and could.

1699
02:03:51,200 --> 02:03:53,180
So there's no O's in the word.

1700
02:03:53,300 --> 02:03:54,460
So there's no O's.

1701
02:03:55,040 --> 02:03:56,080
That's that we know.

1702
02:03:56,540 --> 02:03:58,420
That we know there's no O's.

1703
02:03:59,100 --> 02:04:01,100
And then there's no... There could be a D.

1704
02:04:01,620 --> 02:04:03,180
So it could be sand.

1705
02:04:06,240 --> 02:04:07,520
It could be sand.

1706
02:04:07,960 --> 02:04:09,320
Or it could be spied.

1707
02:04:11,440 --> 02:04:12,480
Because sand...

1708
02:04:12,500 --> 02:04:30,440

02:07:12,130 --> 02:07:13,890
Let me be...

1724
02:07:13,890 --> 02:07:14,290
No!

1725
02:07:23,610 --> 02:07:24,330
It's okay.

1726
02:07:24,450 --> 02:07:26,510
My bobby pin is...

1727
02:07:26,510 --> 02:07:27,010
No!

1728
02:07:32,020 --> 02:07:32,560
There.

1729
02:07:32,780 --> 02:07:33,180
Oh, no.

1730
02:07:34,360 --> 02:07:34,760
We did!

1731
02:07:34,880 --> 02:07:35,140
No.

1732
02:07:36,920 --> 02:07:38,260
We did it!

1733
02:07:38,420 --> 02:07:38,880
Yay!

1734
02:07:39,960 --> 02:07:40,900
Can I still do this?

1735
02:07:41,200 --> 02:07:41,860
Okay, let's...

1736
02:07:41,860 --> 02:07:42,880
We unlocked it in.

1737
02:07:42,900 --> 02:07:46,040
Anyway, okay, anyway, so, all right, so we figure it out.

1738
02:07:46,540 --> 02:07:48,000
Okay, there's one likeness.

1739
02:07:48,240 --> 02:07:48,240
And,

1740
02:07:53,560 --> 02:07:55,260
all right, so there's one likeness.

1741
02:07:55,360 --> 02:07:57,160
Okay, now it's just out of pride.

1742
02:07:57,640 --> 02:08:02,100
Now it's just, now it's just out of pride now.

1743
02:08:02,280 --> 02:08:04,520
All right, range, there's one likeness.

1744
02:08:04,860 --> 02:08:06,160
Okay, it could be faces?

1745
02:08:06,640 --> 02:08:08,140
There's zero, so it's not A.

1746
02:08:08,540 --> 02:08:12,820
We know it's not A because, like, none of this match.

1747
02:08:12,900 --> 02:08:15,120
So it's either R, N, G, or E.

1748
02:08:16,480 --> 02:08:16,880
So, all right.

1749
02:08:16,960 --> 02:08:18,120
There's no other...

1750
02:08:18,120 --> 02:08:19,160
There's an R here.

1751
02:08:19,260 --> 02:08:20,260
We could try to rely.

1752
02:08:20,380 --> 02:08:20,960
Got it.

1753
02:08:20,960 --> 02:08:21,860
I did it!

1754
02:08:22,140 --> 02:08:23,300
Oh, my God!

1755
02:08:23,540 --> 02:08:24,340
We did it!

1756
02:08:24,420 --> 02:08:25,420
We unlocked it!

1757
02:08:25,420 --> 02:08:27,600
Guys, I fucking knew it, guys.

1758
02:08:28,040 --> 02:08:30,040
God, I'm so fucking smart.

1759
02:08:30,420 --> 02:08:31,480
There's nothing in...

1760
02:08:31,480 --> 02:08:32,540
Oh, there's a power core.

1761
02:08:32,700 --> 02:08:33,580
There's a fusion core.

1762
02:08:33,660 --> 02:08:34,220
Let's go.

1763
02:08:35,440 --> 02:08:36,920
I did it, guys.

1764
02:08:37,220 --> 02:08:39,640
I fucking knew I wasn't that stupid.

1765
02:08:40,200 --> 02:08:41,040
I knew it.

1766
02:08:42,900 --> 02:08:44,020
There's hope for you all.

1767
02:08:44,660 --> 02:08:47,520
If I can solve that, you can all solve it.

1768
02:08:48,040 --> 02:08:48,660
Where do I go?

1769
02:08:48,800 --> 02:08:50,300
There's so many places to go.

1770
02:08:51,460 --> 02:08:52,320
Oh, scalpel.

1771
02:08:52,740 --> 02:08:53,040

1849
02:14:05,380 --> 02:14:06,720
Those raiders proved us wrong.

1850
02:14:08,500 --> 02:14:09,100
But...

02:31:48,470 --> 02:31:50,970
How does he have a longer range than me?

2116
02:31:51,650 --> 02:31:51,950

02:31:53,090 --> 02:31:53,390

02:32:04,170 --> 02:32:05,170

2124
02:32:07,290 --> 02:32:07,770

2125
02:32:09,670 --> 02:32:10,270

2127
02:32:11,950 --> 02:32:14,550
I'm running out of stims.

2128
02:32:14,850 --> 02:32:15,970
Have you seen it?

2129
02:32:16,250 --> 02:32:17,670

2130
02:32:17,890 --> 02:32:18,450
This is gonna work.

2131
02:32:18,670 --> 02:32:19,810
This is for the Akasupa.

2132
02:32:20,870 --> 02:32:23,190
Oh my god, this is not okay.

2133
02:32:23,930 --> 02:32:25,690
This is not okay.

2134
02:32:32,290 --> 02:32:35,350
Okay, don't worry.

2135
02:32:35,550 --> 02:32:36,310
I can do this.

2136
02:32:37,270 --> 02:32:38,030
Come back.

2137
02:32:38,850 --> 02:32:39,530
Come back.

2138
02:32:39,710 --> 02:32:40,210
I got this.

2139
02:32:40,310 --> 02:32:42,630
I'm going to use VATs for my fist.

2140
02:32:46,290 --> 02:32:46,330
Boom.

2141
02:32:50,230 --> 02:32:50,870
Ah!

2142
02:32:56,330 --> 02:32:57,230
Did it!

2143
02:33:00,890 --> 02:33:02,070
There we go.

2144
02:33:02,670 --> 02:33:06,670
We might have used a lot of our stims, guys.

2145
02:33:07,290 --> 02:33:08,570
That'd be combo.

2146
02:33:09,330 --> 02:33:10,610
We fucking did it.

2147
02:33:10,710 --> 02:33:11,730
We lost a lot.

2148
02:33:11,950 --> 02:33:12,850
But we did it.

2149
02:33:12,910 --> 02:33:14,430
Not even close.

2150
02:33:14,830 --> 02:33:17,350
I definitely have, like, zero stims.

2151
02:33:19,270 --> 02:33:20,890
It's John Cena!

2152
02:33:22,230 --> 02:33:23,490
Alright, it was worth it.

2153
02:33:24,150 --> 02:33:25,590
It was fucking worth it, guys.

2154
02:33:25,730 --> 02:33:27,750
Yeah, I don't have the sims anymore, guys.

2155
02:33:27,870 --> 02:33:29,870
I don't have sims anymore.

2156
02:33:34,430 --> 02:33:36,270
Alright, Doki Smash.

2157
02:33:36,430 --> 02:33:39,230
I knew investing in strength was the way to go, guys.

2158
02:33:39,610 --> 02:33:40,830
I fucking knew it.

2159
02:33:41,130 --> 02:33:42,530
Alright, we gotta get rid of stuff.

2160
02:33:42,610 --> 02:33:44,870
We actually have too much junk now.

2161
02:33:46,130 --> 02:33:46,690
Uh...

2162
02:33:46,690 --> 02:33:48,330
But what can we get rid of?

2163
02:33:48,970 --> 02:33:50,670
Everything is so important.

2164
02:33:52,910 --> 02:33:54,950
Everything's so important, though.

2165
02:33:56,950 --> 02:33:57,470
Nice.

2166
02:33:58,590 --> 02:33:59,970
I don't know what to get rid of.

2167
02:34:00,350 --> 02:34:02,190
Okay, we could get rid of.

2168
02:34:03,030 --> 02:34:05,810
Bro, all these guns are so important.

2169
02:34:07,230 --> 02:34:08,050
Eat the food.

2170
02:34:08,770 --> 02:34:09,310
Okay, wait.

2171
02:34:09,330 --> 02:34:10,770
But the food won't help.

2172
02:34:12,510 --> 02:34:13,910
Get rid of the power armor.

2173
02:34:14,530 --> 02:34:16,070
Do I just take off my armor?

2174
02:34:16,970 --> 02:34:18,750
Okay, a pair of...

2175
02:34:18,750 --> 02:34:19,590
Where is it?

2176
02:34:20,150 --> 02:34:21,650
How do I get out of it?

2177
02:34:22,970 --> 02:34:24,590
Do you really need five?

2178
02:34:24,710 --> 02:34:25,150
Yes.

2179
02:34:27,190 --> 02:34:28,290
Okay, maybe you're right.

2180
02:34:28,490 --> 02:34:29,290
Maybe I should...

2181
02:34:30,070 --> 02:34:32,550
Okay, I'll get rid of one.

2182
02:34:32,750 --> 02:34:33,590
All right, fine.

02:34:35,950 --> 02:34:36,490

Fine, I'll get rid of it.

All right, nice.

2187
02:34:46,170 --> 02:34:47,330
Where was I supposed to go?

2188
02:34:48,490 --> 02:34:49,270

2189
02:34:51,530 --> 02:34:52,770

2244
02:38:48,500 --> 02:38:50,040

2246
02:38:51,360 --> 02:38:52,620
We gotta have a rent agreement.

2247
02:38:56,360 --> 02:38:57,740
We need to have an agreement.

2248
02:39:03,930 --> 02:39:06,270
Look, I am the sole survivor of that neighborhood.

2249
02:39:06,290 --> 02:39:07,850
So that makes me queen of the neighborhood.

2250
02:39:08,770 --> 02:39:10,050
That's how it works in suburbia.

2251
02:39:10,310 --> 02:39:11,250
I am the HOA.

2252
02:39:11,450 --> 02:39:12,390
I'm the new HOA.

2253
02:39:18,660 --> 02:39:20,940
I am the new landlord now.

2254
02:39:22,040 --> 02:39:25,100
If everybody else is dead, that makes me the president of
the HOA.

2255
02:39:26,140 --> 02:39:27,320
Because I'm the last one.

2256
02:39:30,320 --> 02:39:37,220

fucking loading screen is forever.

Anyway, I am glad you're here.

2349
02:46:30,830 --> 02:46:32,570
Wait, did I fuck up the conversation?

2350
02:46:33,350 --> 02:46:34,610
But I've got another favor to ask.

2351
02:46:35,170 --> 02:46:37,430
I've had word from a settlement asking for help.

2352
02:46:37,830 --> 02:46:38,170
What?

2353
02:46:38,430 --> 02:46:41,270
Still hoping there are Minuteman out there somewhere.

2354
02:46:41,810 --> 02:46:46,870
The only chance to start rebuilding the Minuteman is to show
people that they can count on us when they need us.

2355
02:46:47,350 --> 02:46:49,910
Trouble is, I've got my hands full here.

2356
02:46:51,610 --> 02:47:01,230

for a chance to rescue some more helpless villagers it's not

2357
02:47:01,230 --> 02:47:07,150
that people are helpless they just need someone to give them
a helping hand sometimes that's what the minute man is

2358
02:47:07,150 --> 02:47:15,010
supposed to be i want to be a minute man you guys do it for
free talk to sturgis i'm sure he'd be glad for all the help

2359
02:47:15,010 --> 02:47:15,490
he can get

2360
02:47:21,850 --> 02:47:23,730
But what if I just want to settle?

2361
02:47:27,150 --> 02:47:29,370
Do I have meds for you?

2362
02:47:36,530 --> 02:47:38,910
Yes, I was literally born here.

2363
02:47:39,250 --> 02:47:39,870
My energy?

2364
02:47:40,430 --> 02:47:41,010
My energy?

2365
02:47:42,190 --> 02:47:42,790
What do you mean?

2366
02:47:43,010 --> 02:47:44,690
Thought I told you before, kid.

2367
02:47:45,070 --> 02:47:47,430
I saw you leave that icebox.

2368
02:47:48,070 --> 02:47:49,710
I know your pain.

2369
02:47:51,610 --> 02:47:53,130
Which faction's the best?

2370
02:47:53,430 --> 02:47:53,750
Which get...

2371
02:47:53,750 --> 02:47:54,850
Okay, let me rephrase this.

2372
02:47:55,130 --> 02:47:57,030
Which faction gives me the best stuff?

2373
02:47:58,370 --> 02:48:00,430
I don't care about more than...

2374
02:48:00,430 --> 02:48:04,610
We don't need the good ending.

2375
02:48:05,430 --> 02:48:06,270
Wait, here you go.

2376
02:48:06,650 --> 02:48:07,350
Here, have some chems.

2377
02:48:07,370 --> 02:48:08,070
I already have some.

2378
02:48:08,330 --> 02:48:10,050
Make a little kick yourself, huh?

2379
02:48:10,810 --> 02:48:11,550
This will do.

2380
02:48:11,830 --> 02:48:15,830
Now, let me ride the high to where the site wants to take
me.

2381
02:48:16,150 --> 02:48:16,970
How much a companion?

2382
02:48:17,030 --> 02:48:17,810
He likes me!

2383
02:48:18,430 --> 02:48:20,270
But they're locked tight.

2384
02:48:21,610 --> 02:48:31,170
and what they know but people's hearts are chained up with
fear and suspicion but you find it you find that heart

2385
02:48:31,170 --> 02:48:41,590
that's gonna lead you to your boy oh it's it's oh no if i'm
if i refuse pressing too much he'll refuse to travel with me

2386
02:48:41,590 --> 02:48:50,230
oh no that's what you need to do kid follow my heart i gave
you and he told me to follow my heart.

2387
02:48:50,770 --> 02:48:51,070
Phew.

2388
02:48:51,990 --> 02:48:52,310
Wow.

2389
02:48:53,470 --> 02:48:56,550
That took more out of me than usual.

2390
02:48:57,290 --> 02:48:59,810
I'm gonna need to rest now, kid.

2391
02:49:00,830 --> 02:49:02,870
What the fuck is that advice?

2392
02:49:03,750 --> 02:49:04,990
You want the best stuff?

2393
02:49:05,070 --> 02:49:06,210
You need ballistic armor.

2394
02:49:06,330 --> 02:49:07,930
Get that from the railroad.

2395
02:49:08,270 --> 02:49:09,510
Thank you for the super chat.

2396
02:49:09,790 --> 02:49:09,970

2398
02:49:13,090 --> 02:49:14,090
Where's Preston?

2399
02:49:15,630 --> 02:49:17,330
What kind of advice was that?

2400
02:49:17,330 --> 02:49:19,750

2401
02:49:20,310 --> 02:49:26,390

bottle casts worth of chems.

2402
02:49:26,950 --> 02:49:27,510
What do you need?

2403
02:49:27,670 --> 02:49:28,410
What kind of help do you need?

2404
02:49:28,970 --> 02:49:31,370
Well, for starters, we could use some real beds.

2405
02:49:32,170 --> 02:49:33,890
We've been sleeping on the ground for too long.

2406
02:49:34,290 --> 02:49:35,310
Aren't you used to it?

2407
02:49:36,690 --> 02:49:37,110
No.

2408
02:49:37,430 --> 02:49:38,830
I can't help right now.

2409
02:49:40,190 --> 02:49:40,430
Ha!

2410
02:49:40,830 --> 02:49:41,890
Let me know if you change your mind.

2411
02:49:42,090 --> 02:49:44,750
Okay, I changed my mind.

2412
02:49:45,790 --> 02:49:47,250
Yeah, I changed my mind.

2413
02:49:47,330 --> 02:49:48,850
Why can't you do it?

2414
02:49:48,850 --> 02:49:50,190
I need my help to build beds.

2415
02:49:50,590 --> 02:49:52,210

2420
02:50:01,490 --> 02:50:02,930

Just make sure we can sleep with a roof over our heads.

2425
02:50:10,230 --> 02:50:12,730
Some of these old houses still look solid enough to do the
trick.

2426
02:50:13,170 --> 02:50:14,830
There's a workbench over there you can use.

2427
02:50:15,450 --> 02:50:16,630

Exactly.

What the fuck is he gonna do?

2472
02:53:51,160 --> 02:53:56,960
Once the base system can also increase the overall happiness
by raising the settlement's defense rating, this will reduce

2473
02:53:56,960 --> 02:53:58,960
the chance that your settlement will be attacked.

2474
02:53:59,280 --> 02:54:00,680
My settlement's gonna be attacked?

2475
02:54:01,340 --> 02:54:02,240

What the store is going to do for me?

2486
02:54:24,120 --> 02:54:24,360
Okay.

2487
02:54:24,560 --> 02:54:25,120
Resources.

2488
02:54:26,040 --> 02:54:26,460
Water.

2489
02:54:26,900 --> 02:54:27,460
Food.

2490
02:54:29,120 --> 02:54:30,280

2491
02:54:30,480 --> 02:54:32,940
Oh, like I can build this.

2492
02:54:33,640 --> 02:54:35,000
No, I don't have concrete.

2493
02:54:35,300 --> 02:54:36,120
Oh, never mind.

2494
02:54:36,200 --> 02:54:37,220
I can't build this.

2495
02:54:37,780 --> 02:54:39,040
Can I build food stuff?

2496
02:54:39,220 --> 02:54:40,220
No, I'm broke.

2497
02:54:40,840 --> 02:54:41,340
Okay.

2498
02:54:41,900 --> 02:54:42,800
Oh, defense.

2499
02:54:43,700 --> 02:54:44,200
Power.

02:54:44,820 --> 02:54:46,300
Oh, I have power.

2501
02:54:51,100 --> 02:54:51,700
How do I?

2502
02:54:52,500 --> 02:54:53,380
Power time.

2503
02:54:54,760 --> 02:54:55,860
I can build a generator.

2504
02:54:59,080 --> 02:55:01,120
I don't know what's gonna do, but I can build it.

2505
02:55:01,660 --> 02:55:02,960
Oh, this builds five.

2506
02:55:03,420 --> 02:55:03,780
Alright.

2507
02:55:04,340 --> 02:55:05,780
I don't know what that does.

2508
02:55:06,400 --> 02:55:07,220
But it's there.

2509
02:55:08,080 --> 02:55:09,140
Scrap the town.

2510
02:55:09,240 --> 02:55:10,520
Okay, I'm gonna scrap my stuff.

2511
02:55:10,640 --> 02:55:11,340
How do I scrap?

2512
02:55:13,240 --> 02:55:13,740
Uh...

2513
02:55:14,260 --> 02:55:15,960
How the fuck do I scrap?

2514
02:55:17,020 --> 02:55:17,420
Transfer?

2515
02:55:17,980 --> 02:55:20,020
Guys, how do I scrap my stuff?

2516
02:55:26,120 --> 02:55:27,480
How do I do that?

2517
02:55:27,580 --> 02:55:28,920
I have so much junk.

2518
02:55:29,840 --> 02:55:31,120
Like, look at this.

2519
02:55:34,760 --> 02:55:35,680
Transfer all junk.

2520
02:55:35,900 --> 02:55:37,800
Point out rubble and there's options to scrap.

2521
02:55:38,460 --> 02:55:39,500
Oververse, thank you for the super chat.

2522

Thank you, thank you.

2523
02:55:40,160 --> 02:55:42,080
Plenty of follow-up for what's the over-under.

2524
02:55:42,320 --> 02:55:45,220
Allowing yourself to be constantly sidetracked by the
Minimum.

2525
02:55:45,520 --> 02:55:46,360
Thank you for that super chat.

2526
02:55:46,540 --> 02:55:46,920

Oh, okay.

2528
02:55:49,800 --> 02:55:52,880
Transport, store all junk?

2529
02:55:57,360 --> 02:55:58,900
That's a lot of junk.

2530
02:55:59,600 --> 02:56:02,980
All right, what did I do after that?

2531
02:56:04,980 --> 02:56:06,300
Then press T?

2532
02:56:06,740 --> 02:56:07,280
I did it.

2533
02:56:08,020 --> 02:56:08,620
And then what?

2534
02:56:11,550 --> 02:56:12,950
Now scrap it?

2535
02:56:13,210 --> 02:56:13,510
Where?

2536
02:56:15,630 --> 02:56:17,470
Did I press V?

2537
02:56:18,950 --> 02:56:19,850

Can't build anything.

2555
02:57:56,390 --> 02:57:57,550
Does this not require power?

2556
02:57:57,710 --> 02:57:58,890
What else requires power?

2557
02:57:59,830 --> 02:58:08,830
Power connector, power light, power miscellaneous, local
gates, manufacturing, power, neon.

2558
02:58:09,090 --> 02:58:09,950
Oh my god!

2559
02:58:11,230 --> 02:58:13,410
But what if I have a neon sign?

2560
02:58:20,410 --> 02:58:22,450
D for Doki.

2561
02:58:24,530 --> 02:58:25,710

2565
02:58:37,850 --> 02:58:41,190
Wait, why isn't it on?

2566
02:58:41,350 --> 02:58:42,630
D for Doki Town.

2567
02:58:43,270 --> 02:58:44,310
How do I connect it?

2568
02:58:44,390 --> 02:58:46,610
I have a generator right here.

2569
02:58:48,410 --> 02:58:49,230
Turn on!

2570
02:58:49,510 --> 02:58:49,950

How do I put a wire?

2578
02:59:57,130 --> 02:59:59,050
Go over to that generator.

2579
03:00:01,370 --> 03:00:03,650
Oh my god, I'm doing it.

2580
03:00:08,050 --> 03:00:09,210

You guys lied to me.

2586
03:00:49,650 --> 03:00:50,910
You guys lied to me.

2587
03:00:51,510 --> 03:00:53,130
I can't attach it anywhere.

2588
03:00:53,690 --> 03:00:54,770
Build something that...

2589
03:00:54,770 --> 03:00:56,190
Where can I attach this?

2590
03:00:56,950 --> 03:00:57,670
Be careful.

2591
03:00:57,870 --> 03:00:59,150
Don't get electrocuted.

2592
03:01:00,670 --> 03:01:02,210
What the fuck is this for?

2593
03:01:04,930 --> 03:01:06,170
I can't believe it.

2594
03:01:06,190 --> 03:01:07,830
I couldn't put the wire on the D.

2595
03:01:08,630 --> 03:01:09,430
It's too far.

2596
03:01:09,530 --> 03:01:10,610
Do I need another one?

2597
03:01:10,970 --> 03:01:11,770
Okay, wait.

2598
03:01:12,870 --> 03:01:15,850
Guys, we're slowly learning how to be an electrician.

2599
03:01:16,090 --> 03:01:18,410
We're just, it's just very slow.

2600
03:01:18,590 --> 03:01:22,750
No, I don't have...

2601
03:01:22,750 --> 03:01:23,630
Okay.

2602
03:01:24,670 --> 03:01:26,650
We don't have enough copper!

2603
03:01:28,050 --> 03:01:28,910
I give up.

2604
03:01:29,170 --> 03:01:30,010
This town doesn't...

2605
03:01:30,010 --> 03:01:30,710
I give up.

2606
03:01:30,790 --> 03:01:31,670
Fuck this town.

2607
03:01:33,230 --> 03:01:34,990
I give up.

2608
03:01:40,450 --> 03:01:42,950
This town doesn't need it.

2609
03:01:43,110 --> 03:01:44,270
Who fucking cares?

2610
03:01:46,490 --> 03:01:49,070
Guys, I fucking, I give up, man.

2611
03:01:49,330 --> 03:01:50,870
I fucking give up.

2612
03:01:51,650 --> 03:01:53,090
This is too difficult.

2613
03:01:53,850 --> 03:01:55,730
You know what?

2614
03:01:56,570 --> 03:01:59,790
This is way too difficult to understand.

2615
03:02:02,230 --> 03:02:04,350
I'll figure this out at another time.

2616
03:02:04,690 --> 03:02:06,530
My brain isn't working today.

2617
03:02:07,210 --> 03:02:08,070
Or tomorrow.

2618
03:02:09,070 --> 03:02:10,530
Wait, why can't I open my...

2619
03:02:11,770 --> 03:02:13,990
Can I open my Pit Boy?

2620
03:02:14,950 --> 03:02:16,170
Where's my pit boy?

2621
03:02:17,990 --> 03:02:20,250
I have one intelligence, guys.

2622
03:02:20,390 --> 03:02:21,230
We all know that.

2623
03:02:21,970 --> 03:02:23,250
Why can't I open my pit boy?

2624
03:02:24,630 --> 03:02:27,870
Is it because, like, it needs me to finish this tutorial?

2625
03:02:29,810 --> 03:02:31,270
I am pressing tab.

2626
03:02:33,050 --> 03:02:34,630
It won't let me...

2627
03:02:34,630 --> 03:02:38,210
It wouldn't let me open my pit boy anymore.

2628
03:02:39,050 --> 03:02:40,410
I'm pressing tab.

2629
03:02:41,830 --> 03:02:43,310
Is it because I...

2630
03:02:43,310 --> 03:02:44,490
Is it because I refuse?

2631
03:02:45,730 --> 03:02:46,750
Oh shit.

2632
03:02:47,150 --> 03:02:47,150
No.

2633
03:02:47,990 --> 03:02:49,030
Oh shit.

2634
03:02:49,170 --> 03:02:51,110
That's not the right one.

2635
03:02:52,510 --> 03:02:54,970
Oh, there you go.

2636
03:02:55,490 --> 03:02:56,030
That's I.

2637
03:02:56,270 --> 03:02:56,490
Okay.

2638
03:02:56,790 --> 03:02:58,370
I wanted to level up.

2639
03:02:58,810 --> 03:02:59,190
Alright guys.

2640
03:02:59,330 --> 03:03:00,550
What do I actually get?

2641
03:03:01,930 --> 03:03:02,850
Apparently I.

2642
03:03:03,530 --> 03:03:05,330
Apparently I chose the wrong perk.

2643
03:03:05,890 --> 03:03:06,250
Guys.

2644
03:03:06,250 --> 03:03:08,470
So what should I actually do?

2645
03:03:11,090 --> 03:03:11,690
Guys.

2646
03:03:12,050 --> 03:03:13,290
Apparently I chose the wrong perk.

2647
03:03:13,390 --> 03:03:14,990
So what perk should I really do.

2648
03:03:16,590 --> 03:03:16,590
Intelligence?

2649
03:03:25,490 --> 03:03:27,430
Check one's under strength.

2650
03:03:27,610 --> 03:03:30,070
I don't want to do like iron fists though.

2651
03:03:30,630 --> 03:03:30,990
Let's see.

2652
03:03:31,150 --> 03:03:33,510
Swing do 40% more damage.

2653
03:03:34,870 --> 03:03:36,510
Intelligence for faster XP.

2654
03:03:38,390 --> 03:03:43,270
Do I really not smarter the better.

2655
03:03:46,050 --> 03:03:47,030
All right, fine.

2656
03:03:47,350 --> 03:03:51,830
I'll be, I'll be like, I read a book, so I'm a little bit
smarter now.

2657
03:03:53,210 --> 03:03:54,230
I read a book, guys.

2658
03:03:54,350 --> 03:03:55,310
Are you happy now?

2659
03:03:56,090 --> 03:03:56,970
I did it.

2660
03:03:57,970 --> 03:03:58,970
I read a book.

2661
03:04:02,960 --> 03:04:04,120
All right.

2662
03:04:06,040 --> 03:04:06,560
Idiot Savant.

2663
03:04:06,680 --> 03:04:07,780
Wait, idiot Savant?

2664
03:04:08,220 --> 03:04:08,840
What's that?

2665
03:04:10,960 --> 03:04:12,120
Idiot Savant.

2666
03:04:13,100 --> 03:04:14,540

Money for Doki's electricity fund.

03:05:03,870 --> 03:05:08,110
I instinctively try to add seven to that title somehow and
say a lot about my priorities.

2680
03:05:08,630 --> 03:05:09,550
I'm not sorry.

2681
03:05:09,670 --> 03:05:10,430
Go Doki.

2682
03:05:11,010 --> 03:05:11,030

I want to go a different direction from Concord.

2701
03:06:33,010 --> 03:06:34,990
There has to be a random quest somewhere.

2702
03:06:36,370 --> 03:06:36,670
Alright.

2703
03:06:38,070 --> 03:06:40,750

Yeah, but I can only sprint.

03:06:44,450 --> 03:06:45,330
Get out of combat mode?

03:06:45,410 --> 03:06:46,910
I can get out of combat mode?

2707
03:06:47,670 --> 03:06:49,270
How do I get out of combat mode?

2708
03:06:51,490 --> 03:06:52,590

03:07:01,590 --> 03:07:03,810
I didn't realize I had caps lock on.

2714
03:07:06,330 --> 03:07:07,670
Oh, there we go.

2715
03:07:09,590 --> 03:07:10,270
Hold R.

2717
03:07:13,490 --> 03:07:14,550
I'm learning so much, guys.

2718
03:07:14,690 --> 03:07:17,030
Okay, we're gonna go past this area.

2719
03:07:17,210 --> 03:07:20,750
There has to be, like, a secret quest somewhere.

2720
03:07:20,830 --> 03:07:22,730
Not a secret quest, but there has to be something.

2721
03:07:23,830 --> 03:07:24,270
What's that?

2722
03:07:24,390 --> 03:07:25,090
Why is that red?

2723
03:07:25,870 --> 03:07:26,270

2724
03:07:26,270 --> 03:07:27,030

2725
03:07:28,110 --> 03:07:28,430
Alright.

2726
03:07:29,250 --> 03:07:31,190
There has to be somebody here.

2727
03:07:34,210 --> 03:07:34,630
No.

2728
03:07:35,890 --> 03:07:37,630
We gotta touch the radiated grass.

2729
03:07:37,690 --> 03:07:39,910
We gotta go outside and touch some grass, Cogsworth.

2730
03:07:40,870 --> 03:07:44,550
You haven't been outside of the home for years now.

2731
03:07:45,610 --> 03:07:46,430
Gorski Cabin.

2732
03:07:46,630 --> 03:07:47,470
Does someone live here?

2733
03:07:48,010 --> 03:07:48,250

2734
03:07:49,690 --> 03:07:50,350

You're a robot.

2746
03:08:07,210 --> 03:08:09,850
People won't try to cancel me if I accidentally shoot you.

2747
03:08:10,410 --> 03:08:10,910

2748

03:09:04,710 --> 03:09:09,250
I have better aim if I shot my...

2760
03:09:09,250 --> 03:09:12,530

2761

03:09:18,630 --> 03:09:20,070
No, nothing I really want to craft.

2765
03:09:22,110 --> 03:09:23,130
How did I miss?

2766
03:09:23,170 --> 03:09:24,190

2767
03:09:24,690 --> 03:09:25,810
How did I miss?

2768
03:09:28,210 --> 03:09:30,310

More junk for me to scrap and never build on in my
settlement.

2772
03:09:41,410 --> 03:09:41,810
Okay.

2773

I identify myself.

2944
03:18:20,510 --> 03:18:23,210
But I can't believe I did all that for lore.

2945
03:18:23,670 --> 03:18:27,110
I identify myself as a free-thinking individual of these
once great United States.

2946
03:18:27,550 --> 03:18:32,330
I will not stand idly by as the government infects the minds
of its people with devices like the electrical tower.

2947
03:18:32,750 --> 03:18:34,330
They've erected in my front lawn.

2948
03:18:34,670 --> 03:18:40,330
I pledge to take down this mind-controlled device by any
means necessary and also begun construction on an...

killed or detained in the government interrogation camp the

03:36:15,520 --> 03:36:15,880
What?

3243
03:36:16,440 --> 03:36:18,360
It's not even possible, guys.

3244
03:36:19,480 --> 03:36:21,160
He said it's not possible.

3245
03:36:21,460 --> 03:36:22,500
He's too stupid.

3246
03:36:24,780 --> 03:36:26,480
I can't believe it.

3247
03:36:26,720 --> 03:36:28,420
He's also too stupid.

3248
03:36:30,220 --> 03:36:33,120
Take him out on the tape first.

3249
03:36:34,020 --> 03:36:35,000
Wait, what is electronics?

3250
03:36:35,200 --> 03:36:36,280
Oh, no, not...

3251
03:36:36,280 --> 03:36:36,940
No!

3252
03:36:37,560 --> 03:36:41,220
I tricked myself into getting into a loading screen.

3253
03:36:42,140 --> 03:36:43,360
What's this place?

3254
03:36:44,080 --> 03:36:44,960
Where am I?

3255
03:36:46,880 --> 03:36:48,660
What is this place, Cogsworth?

3256
03:36:50,000 --> 03:36:51,180
Are there people here?

3257
03:36:51,860 --> 03:36:52,660
Wait, what?

3258
03:36:53,820 --> 03:36:55,460
Oh, I don't feel safe.

3259
03:36:59,060 --> 03:36:59,960
Oh, I don't...

3260
03:36:59,960 --> 03:37:01,880
I don't feel safe.

3261
03:37:04,080 --> 03:37:05,640
I don't know.

3262
03:37:05,820 --> 03:37:06,900
I don't know about...

3263
03:37:09,420 --> 03:37:12,040
There's too many electronics out here.

3264
03:37:12,140 --> 03:37:13,160
Oh, I don't feel safe.

3265
03:37:13,280 --> 03:37:14,240
What if they activate?

3266
03:37:14,940 --> 03:37:17,000
Oh, I'm going to steal some money, though.

3267
03:37:19,740 --> 03:37:20,700
Let's see.

3268
03:37:20,840 --> 03:37:22,660
I'm going to steal some stuff, though.

3269
03:37:25,480 --> 03:37:26,040
Oh, be fun.

3270
03:37:26,120 --> 03:37:27,560
They're deactivated right now.

3271
03:37:29,580 --> 03:37:30,200
They deactivate.

3272
03:37:30,260 --> 03:37:31,260
I can steal some stuff.

3273
03:37:34,300 --> 03:37:36,200
Please assume the position.

3274
03:37:36,700 --> 03:37:39,260
Yeah, I don't feel very safe that...

3275
03:37:39,260 --> 03:37:39,780
Whoa!

3276
03:37:40,880 --> 03:37:41,660
Where is he?

3277
03:37:41,660 --> 03:37:42,100
Where is he?

3278
03:37:42,140 --> 03:37:42,680
Where is he?

3279
03:37:43,140 --> 03:37:43,860
Oh, there he is.

3280
03:37:45,220 --> 03:37:45,940
Okay, nice.

3281
03:37:47,120 --> 03:37:47,700
Oh, shit.

3282
03:37:47,740 --> 03:37:49,320
I do not have the ammo for this.

3283
03:37:49,680 --> 03:37:52,480
I just realized I definitely don't have the ammo for this
gun.

3284
03:37:52,960 --> 03:37:55,580
So we'll just use the typical 10mm pistol for now.

3285
03:37:56,400 --> 03:37:56,840
Alright.

3286
03:37:57,220 --> 03:37:58,540
So I'm just gonna leave.

3287
03:37:59,400 --> 03:38:00,140
I'm just gonna leave.

3288
03:38:05,360 --> 03:38:09,240
They seem like the type of robots that won't stay
deactivated.

3289
03:38:09,580 --> 03:38:11,100
We have a main goal here.

3290
03:38:16,480 --> 03:38:20,160
They look like they can turn on at any second.

3291
03:38:20,560 --> 03:38:21,360
They do.

3292
03:38:22,000 --> 03:38:22,720
They do.

3293
03:38:26,060 --> 03:38:29,880
I must take every junk.

3294
03:38:30,060 --> 03:38:31,180
I see item I take.

3295
03:38:31,420 --> 03:38:32,400
I am a loot goblin.

3296
03:38:35,140 --> 03:38:36,440
War never changes.

3297
03:38:36,780 --> 03:38:38,360
Especially my looting habits.

3298
03:38:39,760 --> 03:38:40,240
Oh my god.

3299
03:38:40,460 --> 03:38:41,020
This loading screen.

3300
03:38:42,140 --> 03:38:48,420
You wouldn't think that like after six plus years the
loading screen would just be a little bit faster

3301
03:38:57,140 --> 03:39:08,480
Please it didn't crash it's moving I'm literally looking at
it move Nine I said plus guys I made sure to say plus years

3302
03:39:12,140 --> 03:39:12,600
Please.

3303
03:39:14,380 --> 03:39:15,860
No, don't say it crashed.

3304
03:39:16,640 --> 03:39:19,840
Don't say I haven't made it to Diamond City yet.

3305
03:39:20,240 --> 03:39:21,740
I haven't made it.

3306
03:39:23,040 --> 03:39:23,680
Yeah.

3307
03:39:27,060 --> 03:39:29,120
Why is it taking so long?

3308
03:39:33,840 --> 03:39:35,360
No, it's moving.

3309
03:39:36,220 --> 03:39:37,300
It's moving.

3310
03:39:37,520 --> 03:39:39,340
I see the screen moving.

3311
03:39:43,680 --> 03:39:44,920
I knew it.

3312
03:39:45,300 --> 03:39:46,620
I fucking knew it.

3313
03:39:46,700 --> 03:39:47,800
I knew it never crashed.

3314
03:39:48,020 --> 03:39:48,400
I've always been.

3315
03:39:48,420 --> 03:40:01,700

far Todd I always believe in you and Todd we trust it just

game keeps crashing I should I should save I should save all

3317
03:40:16,280 --> 03:40:20,100
right this way we don't end stream until I'm making the
diamond city.

3318
03:40:21,240 --> 03:40:22,260
This is all I want.

3319
03:40:24,540 --> 03:40:26,520
Somebody's fighting, but we're gonna ignore him.

3320
03:40:28,180 --> 03:40:29,540
Whoa, what is that?

3321
03:40:29,660 --> 03:40:31,080
What the fuck is that?

3322
03:40:31,940 --> 03:40:32,740
That's a cow.

3323
03:40:33,840 --> 03:40:35,120
Wait, can I loot the cow?

3324
03:40:36,920 --> 03:40:37,740
Oh my god.

3325
03:40:38,540 --> 03:40:39,860
Wait, where's the door to this?

3326
03:40:40,980 --> 03:40:42,480
Wait, I want to loot the cow.

3327
03:40:44,200 --> 03:40:44,640
Okay.

3328
03:40:46,140 --> 03:40:47,140
Can I loot you?

3329
03:40:50,260 --> 03:40:51,300
Please, can I...

3330
03:40:51,300 --> 03:40:52,220
Can you come to me?

3331
03:40:53,820 --> 03:40:55,600
No, why can't I loot the cow?

3332
03:40:56,180 --> 03:40:59,360
If you kill it?

3333
03:41:00,060 --> 03:41:00,620
Can I...

3334
03:41:00,620 --> 03:41:01,360
Should I kill it?

3335
03:41:06,320 --> 03:41:08,000
He doesn't have an owner.

3336
03:41:08,100 --> 03:41:09,100
His owner's dead.

3337
03:41:12,880 --> 03:41:13,440
Oh, I can.

3338
03:41:22,050 --> 03:41:23,030
Go, Cogsworth!

3339
03:41:23,970 --> 03:41:24,990
Go, Cogsworth!

3340
03:41:29,780 --> 03:41:30,840
Oh my god.

3341
03:41:31,940 --> 03:41:32,400
Nice.

3342
03:41:32,620 --> 03:41:33,110
I looted him.

3343
03:41:34,500 --> 03:41:35,420
Get him!

3344
03:41:35,980 --> 03:41:36,560
Alright, nice.

3345
03:41:36,960 --> 03:41:36,960
Alright.

3346
03:41:37,380 --> 03:41:38,420
Whoa, what the fuck?

3347
03:41:39,680 --> 03:41:41,180
Why are people fighting?

3348
03:41:42,140 --> 03:41:42,960
I don't understand.

3349
03:41:43,360 --> 03:41:43,660
What?

3350
03:41:44,240 --> 03:41:46,760
Not me.

3351
03:41:47,760 --> 03:41:49,440
Look, I only have one mission here.

3352
03:41:49,540 --> 03:41:50,620

3353
03:41:51,520 --> 03:41:51,900

Here, the different raider groups are carving up conch like
a Christmas turkey.

3387
03:44:52,230 --> 03:44:54,230
He's a Diamond City security guard.

3388
03:44:54,530 --> 03:44:55,610
This is one of their bases?

03:44:56,510 --> 03:44:56,850
