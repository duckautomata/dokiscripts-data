1
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:10,120
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to WrestleMania 24!

2
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:21,580
We have an outstanding evening prepared for you tonight.

3
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:26,680
I am your last minute replacement, ring it down sir,
Takahata.

4
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:33,740
I normally serve drinks, but tonight I'm going to be serving
up some announcing of some of the best wrestling that come

5
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:42,560
out of the wrestling sphere and the V-Tuber sphere, a
collision of Titans, and a complete combination of talents

6
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,700
in a collab that can only end in absolute anarchy.

7
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:56,360
And this is all being called by an amazing announced team,
and I'd like to cut to them right now if we can.

8
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,620
Hello, hello everybody!

9
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,580
Welcome to WrestleTuber 2024.

10
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:12,400
So I'll be here to introduce to you guys the format of this
event.

11
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,340
We apologize for the delays here.

12
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:18,260
There was been some last minute replacements, some last
minute sub-ins.

13
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:25,980
Unfortunately, Sayu is currently experiencing some delays
today, but he will be here tomorrow to continue the

14
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:26,500
announcement.

15
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:29,780
So huge shout out to Taka for subbing in.

16
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:30,680
Super last minute.

17
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:34,100
He's literally writing notes on how to announce, like, as we
speak.

18
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:39,900
We actually, we actually, like, five minutes before the
stream was supposed to start.

19
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:44,160
He was like, wait, so what am I supposed to announce when we
start the event?

20
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:46,520
And I was like, oh, shit, okay.

21
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:49,620
Let me see if I can figure out what you're supposed to say.

22
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:56,360
So huge shout out to Taka for coming in last minute.

23
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:05,500
to help us out he actually has i believe uh he is one of two
members uh in this event that has uh the most wwe experience

24
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:15,960
out of all of us so really came in clutch for us here anyway
welcome welcome to wrestle tuber um i am very nervous i'm

25
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:26,160
scared there might be a lot of scuff going in i am merely
one person controlling the entire obs right now so i do

26
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,600
apologize for the scuff in advance.

27
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,540
We're already behind schedule too.

28
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:39,760
So huge shout out to all the members, all the VTubers coming
in here, giving up their day and time to be participating in

29
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:40,520
this event.

30
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:46,960
They're really giving up their time to be here, to wrestle,
to give their interviews.

31
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:47,920
They'll all be here.

32
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:51,140
Everyone that's participating will be here in some shape and
form.

33
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:55,300
So really huge shout out to every participating member.

34
00:06:55,900 --> 00:07:06,540
Anyway, we actually have the belt now if you guys would like
to see what the belt would look like so um the people who

35
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:12,920
are winning the show matches and the tournament there's
going to be a show matches and tournament for each day so

36
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:18,220
the show match will open up uh the people who are part of
the show match will only be there for one match and then

37
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:25,940
they'll be gone and then we'll go straight into the
tournament format uh and each winner of both the show

38
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:32,120
matches and the tournament will receive the WrestleTuber
belt!

39
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:33,680
Oh, that's me, I moved.

40
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:40,520
This is what the WrestleTuber belt is going to look like.

41
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:49,320
Gamersup is fully funding and sponsoring this event, and
they will be providing and shipping out the WrestleTuber

42
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:54,100
belts to the winning participants, to the champions.

43
00:07:54,840 --> 00:08:03,980
Also, each participating member is gonna receive a little
gift as a thank you for participating in WrestleTuber so uh

44
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:10,860
so everybody the staff um the staff and the the wrestlers
themselves will each receive something uh just as a little

45
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:22,060
thank you to be like thank you for being here now the
brackets before we start um here is the bracket one uh we'll

46
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:27,040
have bracket one and bracket two most likely bracket three
might be on day two we're not sure.

47
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,160
It depends on how long this is going to take.

48
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:32,960
It depends on how fast the matches are or how slow the games
are going to be.

49
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:34,840
So here are the brackets.

50
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:39,040
We're going to have Lyme and Kai firsting up first and then
Emma and Rin.

51
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:43,380
And apparently the biggest, one of the biggest matches of
today.

52
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,280
Gerard and Assyria.

53
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:51,520
We're going to see if Gerard's going to survive another
extinction.

54
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,500
And then we have Fuyo and Snuffy.

55
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,660
So that would be your bracket.

56
00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:07,180
one um bracket one for day one uh we might have we're we are
absolutely gonna have bracket two uh we're not sure about uh

57
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:19,240
bracket three yet because uh you know these take a while so
it's gonna be interesting how how long it is gonna be anyway

58
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:33,640
before we begin um we do have our first match of today
before we go straight into the turn of whoa wait whoa oh

59
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:41,260
wait you guys didn't hear that i told you guys there might
be scuffed along the way and i realized you guys didn't hear

60
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:45,660
what i just heard but but don't worry please play that
replay

61
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,040
That was backstage?

62
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:02,350
Wrong.

63
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:04,290
It equals fish.

64
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:06,750
It does not.

65
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:09,030
Filtered.

66
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:12,510
It definitely equals fish.

67
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:14,730
Are you?

68
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:16,250
Ah.

69
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:18,930
Are you sure about that, Centrea?

70
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:21,590
Maybe you flunked math.

71
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:23,210
Yes.

72
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:25,350
fish.

73
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:29,670
Man, Zintre is really brainwashed herself.

74
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:38,780
You don't even know what 4 plus 4 is, I bet.

75
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,240
Well, I don't mess around scent.

76
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:51,210
None of that adding to fish with me.

77
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:52,850
I have a quick question for you.

78
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:54,810
Please do.

79
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:04,300
Since you're trying to find my dad, what if I showed you my
dad?

80
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:06,580
That may work.

81
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:20,510
I can talk like you guys can, chat, chat, chat, chat, chat,
chat, chat.

82
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:24,790
Your text-to-speech is extremely confusing.

83
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:28,250
I wouldn't mind hearing real chat though.

84
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:30,510
Speak for yourself.

85
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:31,870
What the fuck?

86
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:32,730
How's that?

87
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:35,650
As long as I can still make sense Vidal.

88
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:42,350
This stream is first and foremost about making sense,
anything else is just an added bonus.

89
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:51,490
my god do you even know anything about wrestling i could
tear john cena apart

90
00:11:55,820 --> 00:12:04,880
you can't even see john cena that's what he thinks centuria
so that begs to differ the point

91
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:20,590
exactly okay listen sorry i uh what were you saying so let's
say

92
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:33,170
intelligent isn't that right twitch chat okay it looks like
you found my dad by the way chaos underscore lives on 123

93
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:40,710
omega street is not a valid address i would like to
congratulate you on finding him i haven't found him yet but

94
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:49,010
i'm glad you're optimistic actually i don't know if that's
even my dad i'll let you decide that when i do find him i

95
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:50,750
kind of just found him out in the

96
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:58,130
that based on your last comment maybe you're mistaken

97
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:15,360
yeah i just found some homeless guy out in the forest and i
decided to call him big papa bear in a forest oh my god i

98
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:21,380
can't believe it that's what i'm looking for right off the
bat they're fighting backstage

99
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:33,540
yeah he doesn't really say much please ladies girls You're
supposed to take it in the ring!

100
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:35,460
What are you doing here?

101
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,600
He does, yeah.

102
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:38,860
Hey, chat.

103
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:40,600
I kind of look like Hulk Hogan.

104
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,660
We haven't, I don't even have my Hulk Haster here yet.

105
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,520
And they're ready to play, and they're ready to fight.

106
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,940
I hope I'm not the next thing you think about.

107
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:48,580
Ladies, please.

108
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:51,160
I probably should not have brought this guy from the forest.

109
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,860
I think returning them would be a great idea.

110
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:58,500
I was just less speechless.

111
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,040
I can't believe it.

112
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:06,740
Our show matches were supposed to be in the ring, but yet
these ladies just couldn't stop!

113
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:09,840
And how would you know...

114
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,100
There isn't even a ref!

115
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,520
Who is controlling?

116
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:15,140
How would we know the winner?

117
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,920
Because every time I talk to them, they would just grunt.

118
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,640
Perhaps they are just lacking intelligence.

119
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:24,260
There are remarkably few bilingual grizzlies.

120
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,620
Zen just... No, that's Zen.

121
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:31,640
Zen just happens to change into the bear elf.

122
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:36,200
I don't know about the intelligence part, but I do know that
they are super fucking strong.

123
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:38,880
Oh my god, who would win?

124
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:42,060
Beerman versus a little girl.

125
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,260
This shouldn't even be legal.

126
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:47,940
Oh my, the little girl has a fucking chair.

127
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:49,580
What is this all going to do?

128
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:50,240
Not the chair!

129
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,280
But I would appreciate it if I had you in the long.

130
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,340
Someone says it correctly.

131
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,420
Why would I want to be fair?

132
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:57,620
I'm facing you.

133
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:02,160
Oh my god, the fucking dropkick!

134
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:05,040
Wait, who is feeding Neurosama?

135
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:07,360
I mean, you're facing my dad, so to speak.

136
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,640
Not really my dad, though.

137
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:12,700
Oh, okay, this is a little bit embarrassing for Zend.

138
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:13,480
Not gonna lie.

139
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:15,660
I mean, look at them!

140
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,800
She's getting beat up by a little girl!

141
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:22,120
No, look, it's it's Summer Homeless Guy.

142
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,600
You're over a little chair!

143
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:24,700
Oh!

144
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,540
And Zintrea is stunned!

145
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:38,880
place you'll see these homeless guys is in your nightmares
and at why not's house of course how is she doing i have

146
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:47,720

147
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:58,360
affect your lovely personality oh i think nirosama got
another chair i think it's over for zen he's gonna break i

148
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:13,700

couldn't be bad for you could it another chair i mean look

149
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:20,580
somebody anybody i know my math skills are top stop this
battle right now we it's not even legal we don't even have a

150
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:30,240
referee in here to call it the elevator okay how tall are
you i can't express my height in a number small enough to be

151
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,040
within your understanding, Zantreya, but you are correct.

152
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:40,070
Oh my god, how, why is the elevator?

153
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:43,590
Okay, please take the elevator back to the ring!

154
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:48,290
Without shoes, I'm around 4 feet 11 inches.

155
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:51,010
I'm still a girl, though.

156
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:54,210
Oh my gosh.

157
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:55,750
Nero-Sama is stunned.

158
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:57,030
This is it.

159
00:16:57,990 --> 00:16:58,570
Is this it?

160
00:16:58,570 --> 00:16:59,150
Is this it?

161
00:16:59,230 --> 00:16:59,890
Is this over?

162
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:03,150
Does Zantreya have the advantage here.

163
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:04,330
I can literally just pick you up.

164
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:07,530
The cameraman is trying.

165
00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:10,370
There's only one camera!

166
00:17:10,590 --> 00:17:11,790
It's literally the backstage!

167
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:14,050
This wasn't supposed to happen!

168
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:19,250
Oh, and Zen's got her in the liglock now.

169
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:22,790
Also what do you think of my so-called dad?

170
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:27,210
As someone who doesn't have parents, they look pretty good
to me.

171
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:30,010
Not sure what they think of you, though.

172
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:31,890
I suspect they'll be disappointing.

173
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:33,430
Let this happen.

174
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:36,270
I can't believe it.

175
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:38,410
I don't want to join a group that you're a part of.

176
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:44,850
You and your dad must be having to balance anger between
each other and not throwing up after realizing the person

177
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:46,310
you're talking to is such a disaster.

178
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:47,490
Oh my god, the leg lock!

179
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:48,510
Look at her go!

180
00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:51,990
Perhaps me and your father have more in common than we
think.

181
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:53,470
Did she call uncle?

182
00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:55,810
I think it's over.

183
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:57,590
Get on top of her, Nero!

184
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:14,530
Nero come on you're so close bring her back to the elevator
take her home oh what there's a second floor I'm too

185
00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:23,190
powerful you won't see me coming he tapped out it should be
over oh that's a little girl

186
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:33,590
is this over think about elevators I don't know what to
think about elevators.

187
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:36,410
They kind of just move up and down on a string.

188
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:38,250
There is no rep.

189
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:39,950
Who's gonna call this?

190
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:44,090
Nero won!

191
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:48,090
Zentrea actually called it to be over!

192
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:50,410
But yet she continues to fight!

193
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:51,810
You're kind of beating up my dad quite a bit.

194
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:53,550
How does that make you feel?

195
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:56,770
It doesn't faze me in the slightest.

196
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,240
Oh my god.

197
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,100
Oh, and the winner is!

198
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:17,820
really my dad so if you actually do see my dad sent him my
way please maybe if you ask him to teach you more math he

199
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:31,800

204
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,560
I don't think you should be paying anybody, Zen.

205
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:19,920
I don't think you should be paying anybody when the homeless
guy lost to a little girl who's not even real.

206
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:22,680
Save me.

207
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:23,440
Hey, Dokobird.

00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:26,400
Don't pretend like you're a million times better than me.

209
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:30,240
Zintreya, I came out on top once.

210
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:31,480
I can do it again.

211
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:35,850
Damn.

212
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:38,350
You're gonna let her talk to you like that, Zen?

213
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:40,150
She's definitely got spirit.

214
00:20:41,810 --> 00:20:50,710
well thank you zen and nero for being here for the very
first show match um honestly i not expect you guys to do

215
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:59,710
this behind without the refs uh refs there or behind the
backstage but congratulations to nero samma for winning the

00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:07,950

homeless man Zen I think we all know who's the real loser

218
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:30,270
here that was properly scripted bird universe whoa whoa whoa
whoa whoa this is a real wrestling event there is no

219
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:39,650
scripted here guys how dare you out the integrity of
WrestleTuber does not allow scripted events anyway guys I'm

220
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:47,510
gonna go back to the cast Yeah, but homeless man laying on
the ground Bleeding out is totally scripted Anyway EY Clark,

221
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:54,870
you owe me for this one We should call the Ambulance real
quick to help out that Homeless man, but let's take it back

222
00:21:54,870 --> 00:22:02,210
To the casting table Thank you again to Nero and Zen for
being There for the very first match Of the day I'm gonna go

223
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:12,290
back to the casting table now Thank you again to those to
the ladies here Alright We're gonna be Back to the main

224
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:13,350
stage.

225
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:14,190
Wow.

226
00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:14,770
All right.

227
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:15,990
That was unexpected.

228
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:18,050
Very unexpected, of course.

229
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:30,750
Who would have thought that our first fight would be the
backstage brawl without the refs?

230
00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:40,630
It was having two absolutely strong ladies fucking decking
it out on each other.

231
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:51,970
um but of course uh since we got our first show match of the
it's not scripted guys wrestling is real uh i don't know why

232
00:22:51,970 --> 00:23:03,430
uh why you guys would think it's why you guys think it's
scripted because we all know wrestling is very much uh uh

233
00:23:03,430 --> 00:23:11,970
real guys um but yes i guess with that out of the way We are
in for our very first tournament bracket.

234
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:16,630
If you guys forgot, this will be the bracket for today.

235
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:22,770
Our first matchup will be with Lyme versus Kai.

236
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:27,770
I believe they will be there soon.

237
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:36,990
Again, like a huge shout out to Nero and Nero and Zen for
being there for the first show match.

238
00:23:38,210 --> 00:23:45,070
But I'm really looking forward to our first match of the
day.

239
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:49,390
And it's going to be really exciting to see who's going to
win the...

240
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:50,150
It's crazy.

241
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:51,690
You guys all thought Nero's going to win anyway.

242
00:23:52,770 --> 00:23:54,630
None of you believe in Zen?

243
00:23:55,390 --> 00:23:56,330
I can't believe it.

244
00:23:56,430 --> 00:23:58,070
None of you believe in Zen?

245
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:06,110
But it feels weird that this seat is empty, though.

246
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:07,870
I wonder where is...

247
00:24:07,890 --> 00:24:09,350
My co-cat.

248
00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:10,550
Oh, shit!

249
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:13,150
Okay, what the fuck?

250
00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:14,570
What was that?

251
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:15,470
Hello?

252
00:24:15,910 --> 00:24:16,330

What was that?

254
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:24,120
Kept you waiting, huh?

255
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:30,960
This wrestling ring is already haunted by the champion, Doki
Bird.

256
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:44,800
Okay, security?

257
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:46,100
Dude.

258
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:47,240
Security.

259
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:52,600
I thought I said no crashes tonight.

260
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:55,560
What the fuck was that?

261
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,020
How did they get here?

262
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:04,800

What kind of show are you running?

298
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,380
There were volunteers, okay?

299
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:54,600
Nobody was...

300
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:59,060
You didn't even know what you were doing when we gave the
instructions out.

301
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,000
You can't say that!

302
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:01,820
Please.

303
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:03,240
They're here.

304
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:04,100
They're here.

305
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:04,800
Welcome!

306
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,060
That was so stupid!

307
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:07,980
Hello!

308
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:08,980
Let's go!

309
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:10,960
How do you feel?

310
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,860
How do you guys feel for your first match?

311
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:14,500
Oh, sorry, Juno, that's your job.

312
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:15,580
That's my job, ma'am.

313
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:16,460
Excuse me.

314
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:18,000
Oh, she's a big bitch.

315
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:18,580
No, I'm sorry.

316
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:23,240
Um, hi, ladies, as the first matchup of the day, how are you
guys feeling?

317
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:29,960
I'm really hoping that it's a nice quick match because, you
know, it sucks to hurt people.

318
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:32,340
And also, I'm really sleepy, so I'd like to go to bed.

319
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:33,300
Oh, okay.

320
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:36,720
But this is, are you implying that you're going to beat her
quickly?

321
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:37,920
Bro, I can't speak.

322
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:38,520
I'm so sorry.

323
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:42,420
But are you implying that?

324
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:45,940
I'm going to deliver like 500 kilograms of pain and then I'm
going to go to sleep.

325
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:46,640
Oh, damn.

326
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:48,160
Hi, what's your response to that?

327
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:51,780
My response is, listen, I know your games, all right?

328
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:55,320
You're going to play nice, and then you think that's going
to make me go easy on you?

329
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,000
We'll take again.

330
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:58,040
All right, your name is Limu, all right?

331
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:59,560
I'm going to take those limes, all right?

332
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:04,140
I'm going to cut in half, and I'm going to squirt them on
your eyeballs, and then I'm going to take another line, and

333
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:10,280
I'm going to squirt them on my own eyeballs, and then you're
going to eat her ass?

334
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:10,920
No.

335
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:12,480
You're going to eat her ass?

336
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:14,420
Wait, wait, what?

337
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:14,720
You're free?

338
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:17,180
Beat, beat us and beat us and beat us.

339
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:20,300
I heard eat too.

340
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:21,240
Did you hear eat?

341
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:21,660
No.

342
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:22,160
Yeah.

343
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:23,060
I heard eat.

344
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:23,540
Yeah.

345
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:24,500
I'm hungry now.

346
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:29,240
I mean, you simply woke up the competition by doing
something so goddamn strange.

347
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:29,900
Let's go.

348
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:32,100
You know what?

349
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:32,980
Maybe that is the way to go.

350
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:36,200
Just do something so bizarre that your opponent is just so
confused.

351
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:40,320
I've never heard of lime and ash as like a meal, you know?

352
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:40,780
Really?

353
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:42,200
I mean, it's a delicacy.

354
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:46,460
I know what mint's gonna do tonight.

355
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,980
Give it her ideas, oh my god.

356
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:53,040
Don't act like you haven't tried it before, Doki.

357
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:55,920
How did you know that?

358
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:02,570
All right, ladies.

359
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:07,230
So, all right, I guess we're going to start the first match
of the bracket.

360
00:31:07,650 --> 00:31:08,930
Good luck to you, too.

361
00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:11,550
The loser will be back in the interview chair.

362
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:15,710
So, and I believe Juno wishes to talk to Kai after.

363
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:16,750
Yeah, it's going to be Kai.

364
00:31:18,850 --> 00:31:19,710
Okay, fine.

365
00:31:19,810 --> 00:31:20,110

Day one, Scott.

378

They're so nervous.

379
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:30,480
They just wanted to get fighting.

380
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,780
Yeah, they just wanted to get straight into it.

381
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:33,480
We apologize.

382
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:38,260
Wait, what was the legendary move that you were waiting to
see, Doki?

383
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:39,760
The legendary move?

384
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:40,060
Oh, yeah.

00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:54,620
You pay for V-Tubers, and we're giving you V-Tubers.

396
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:55,260
V-Tubers.

397

Oh, my God.

398
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:02,400
Limes threw her back into the ring already.

399
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,140
She's not done yet, though.

400
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,480
I'm really loving Kai's top.

401
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:09,180
Honestly, I know.

402
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:10,140
Where did she get that?

403
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:12,300
It's so magical.

404
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,680
I heard she makes her own clothes.

405
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:15,680
What?

406
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:16,180
Yeah.

407
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:19,700
I mean, it looks like she made it herself Is that a car?

408
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:21,720
I can't tell That's a compliment or

409
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:35,460
Oh, and a kick to the face Please, she can't afford plastic

00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:16,880
lime i'm hoping to see lime tear out kai's um chest hair
That's true.

414
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:18,400
She needs to shave.

415
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:18,840
Yeah.

416
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:21,140
Like, oh, and then a pin?

417
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:21,860
Oh.

418
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:24,860
That's unfortunate.

00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:26,560
Come on, get her ass.

420
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:27,480

Hey, you remember that move?

422
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:33,160
That move is very familiar.

423
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:42,120
For some reason, I felt like I've seen that move before in a
dream.

424
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,160
Maybe you hit your head.

425
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:59,560
many times because of it what the fuck is she doing oh my
god oh my god what she's really dragging her up to the into

Look at that tail, though.

431
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:25,080
No.

432
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:26,580
It's a petty shot.

433
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:31,420
We see where Mint's eyes are going, too.

434
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:34,300
Hey, good thing you don't have an eye tracker.

435

The London Bridge.

What the?

464
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:44,560
Kai just took it.

465
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,260
Like, Kai just literally got it.

466
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:57,840
in position to take that yeah what is she doing why is she
rotating her into the middle get up kai this is not soccer

How did you miss Lime?

470
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:21,000
She was right there.

471
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:24,180
Kai was just regaining a little bit of energy.

472
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:24,960
But, oh.

473
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:29,040
Oh, she's getting back up.

474
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:31,180
Oh, she's getting that energy from the crowd.

475
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:32,260
She's hyping everybody up.

476
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:33,320
It's like, give me your energy.

477
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:34,520
It's just like Dragon Ball.

478
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:36,160
We're like, give me your energy.

479
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:40,560
Raise your hands in the air and give me the energy.

480
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:42,060
Raise your hands, everybody.

481
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:43,780
Raise your hands.

482
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:45,840
One, two.

483
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:50,700
Oh, you didn't give enough energy, and it's your fault,
chat.

484
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:51,620
Oh, dang.

485
00:39:55,690 --> 00:39:57,050
What the fuck?

486
00:39:57,710 --> 00:39:59,450
That is not safe.

487
00:40:00,130 --> 00:40:03,050
No, they could have hit someone outside the ring with that.

488
00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:03,510
I know.

489
00:40:03,570 --> 00:40:04,390
They don't care.

490
00:40:04,930 --> 00:40:06,410
They probably say Tuscaru.

491
00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:09,370
Again, again.

492
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:12,910
We love seeing anime girls cry.

493
00:40:13,410 --> 00:40:14,050
Do it again.

494
00:40:15,050 --> 00:40:15,910
What the fuck?

495
00:40:16,450 --> 00:40:17,390
Holy shit.

496
00:40:18,450 --> 00:40:19,250
That's swing.

497
00:40:19,610 --> 00:40:21,410
They better get back in the ring soon, though.

498

Are you a bird?

527
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:28,780
You're not a lion.

528
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:30,000
It's ferret agility.

529
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:30,580
Don't worry about it.

530
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:31,400
We got no bones.

531
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:37,780
Oh, I want to talk about your move where you, like, bounced
three times and then, like, front-fliped into her stomach.

532
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:40,000
That was incredible.

533
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:41,000
Oh, yes, please.

534
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:43,320
Describe what was going through your throat.

535
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:44,700
Yeah, my ribs!

536
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:49,800
I liked all the I liked all the moves specifically where it
kind of just looked like I was giving you a nice stretch.

537
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:52,140
It's like, I'm sorry for kicking you in the face, Queen,
here.

538
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:53,540
Let me just quickly, like, you know.

539
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:59,820
give your back a little bit of a stretch out is that better
no no no i would have rather you beat my ass instead of this

540
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:10,320
fucking embarrassment dragging me around the ring all right
you lift you i'm sorry yeah you could have looked you said

541
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:20,380
to break my ribs yeah that that makes sense you lost to a
girl who couldn't even lift you kai that's wow i tried i

542
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:30,400
tried to have a cutback like agility too yeah you can't just
put it all on strength there i really did like the part

543
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:34,440
though where i climbed up on the side of the ring and then
tried to like pull you up to do something and then kind of

544
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:45,580
just gave up because you're returning i've been bulking i'm
bulking i'm bulking i guess the whole thing is for you to

545
00:43:45,580 --> 00:43:55,580
stop bulking kind of that's that's a more less you want to
be more more mashed it's harder for her to like you know

546
00:43:55,580 --> 00:44:00,980
carry me around all right yeah but then it's also harder for
you to move your own limbs kai but but i have like

547
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:11,680
protection no you definitely didn't have protection if your
ribs are broken don't don't judge my ways okay there's a

room while the too late, the loser and the winner should

564
00:45:19,740 --> 00:45:20,100

No, that kind of advice!

593
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:35,820
I don't know about it.

594
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:37,000
I think, oh my goodness.

595
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:39,880
You're gonna be a little under the table action going on
here.

596
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:41,200
Yeah, Gina, what is it?

00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:42,420
Uh, Renu should deafen?

00:46:42,780 --> 00:46:43,620
You should deafen me?

599
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,320
I feel like it's a topic I need to deafen for.

600
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:48,220
Maybe it doesn't need to be said on live streaming.

601
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:53,140
The great thing is that this isn't TV.

602
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:56,640
No, I gave you an out and everything.

603
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:03,420
Well, let's just say Rin today is going to be raiding some
dungeons tonight.

604
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:06,840
I don't think any of that is going to be happening
personally.

605
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:08,860
Will the British be coming, you know?

606
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:11,260
Oh, the British be coming.

607
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:15,400
I think the British are going to be going straight into
another grave, guys.

608
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:17,280
Well.

609
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:19,840
Any smack talk?

610
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:23,580
all I sense is confusedness and confusion.

611
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:25,360
Yeah, I guess you're talking.

612
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:28,580
If I wasn't scared before, I'm very scared now.

613
00:47:28,740 --> 00:47:29,380
Thank you.

614
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:31,340
No, it's okay, Rin.

615
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:37,160
You can just show me your little sword over here and sleep
with me.

616
00:47:37,820 --> 00:47:37,960
What?

617
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:38,340
What?

618
00:47:39,020 --> 00:47:40,420
Wait, she's a prince!

619
00:47:40,540 --> 00:47:41,840
Like, she has a sword with!

620
00:47:42,100 --> 00:47:43,460
She has a sword with her!

621
00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:44,220
Must be?

622
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:45,660
You, you're a little prince.

623
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:46,860
She has a sword with you, right?

624
00:47:48,060 --> 00:47:48,440
Salt?

625
00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:49,800
I'm very confused.

626
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:51,440
RID!

627
00:47:52,260 --> 00:47:52,820
RID!

628
00:47:54,340 --> 00:47:54,860
RID!

629
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:55,960
You have a sword!

630
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:59,700
You have a sword!

631
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:01,380
Come on, RID!

632
00:48:01,860 --> 00:48:01,920
A sword!

633
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:05,640
A freaking sword!

634
00:48:06,540 --> 00:48:07,280
A sword!

635
00:48:07,540 --> 00:48:09,620
What kind of sword I'm talking about!

636
00:48:09,860 --> 00:48:10,280
Your sword!

637
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:11,900
Everyone yelling at me!

638
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:17,840
RID is just, it's like, RID is like this little confused boy
at a supermarket.

639
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:19,960
He's like, we're so involved.

640
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:22,500
I'm scared!

641
00:48:22,860 --> 00:48:24,060
Your mom's with me, Rin.

642
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:27,360
Oh, that'd be for fast, because that's the Superbike!

643
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:29,200
Oh, you always were my favorite one, you were knocking.

644
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:31,640
Yes.

645
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:34,180
I hope y'all duke it out.

646
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:36,140
I honestly don't know who I want to win.

647
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:39,440
Okay, no, Juno, consider, consider.

648
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:42,800
If I win, wait, shit, no, Kai lost, never mind.

649
00:48:43,060 --> 00:48:43,400
Yeah.

650
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:47,660
Now, I was kind of hoping that I'd be able to face off
against Kai, but you know what?

651
00:48:48,980 --> 00:48:49,560
It's okay.

652
00:48:49,940 --> 00:48:50,420
Next time.

653
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:52,120
Are you just accepting it?

654
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:53,180
She just gave up.

655
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:54,840
Yeah, I was just like, are you guys just giving up?

656
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:56,500
Like, what is this?

657
00:48:56,680 --> 00:48:58,080
Yeah, you just gave up me.

658
00:48:58,680 --> 00:48:59,040
You know.

659
00:48:59,240 --> 00:48:59,900
Come on, Rene.

660
00:49:00,260 --> 00:49:01,640
Where's the passion, Rene?

661
00:49:02,020 --> 00:49:03,040
Give us the passion.

662
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:09,340
Uh, I'm, I'm, I'm gonna, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.

663
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:11,020
She's British and has no emotion.

664
00:49:11,660 --> 00:49:11,900
I love this.

665
00:49:12,780 --> 00:49:14,180
I'm feeling it already.

666
00:49:14,340 --> 00:49:15,040
I'm feeling something.

667
00:49:15,220 --> 00:49:16,460
I feel something.

668
00:49:17,100 --> 00:49:17,900
I feel something.

669
00:49:18,380 --> 00:49:19,400
I mean, you could guess it.

670
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:20,000
Who knows?

671
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:31,780
it's okay read i'll i'll eat fish and chip with you after
this okay we'll make oh in her dungeon in her time no it's

672
00:49:31,780 --> 00:49:39,840

now going to go back to the main stage and we'll see who's

673
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:43,800

674
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:51,400
Lord, help us all.

675
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:53,340
I'll see you ladies later.

676
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:55,580
All right.

677
00:49:56,220 --> 00:49:58,300
Let us, we have the votes.

678
00:49:58,580 --> 00:50:06,380
And currently, Ryn is actually winning the poll at the
moment, which is very surprising after what we saw in the

679
00:50:06,380 --> 00:50:06,720
interview.

680
00:50:07,060 --> 00:50:09,380
It's always the ones that are most timid, though, you know.

681
00:50:09,380 --> 00:50:10,280
That's so true.

682
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:11,860
They're hiding, like, their power level.

683
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:13,140
Exactly, exactly.

684
00:50:13,140 --> 00:50:13,800
Yeah, you're right.

685
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:14,280
You're right.

686
00:50:14,540 --> 00:50:16,300
They're hiding their power level.

687
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:19,720
Like, you don't know, you don't know what's going to happen.

688
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:20,480
Don't worry.

689
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:22,980
We have the intro this time around.

690
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:24,740
I did not forget it this time.

691
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:27,340
I apologize to Don't worry.

692
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:30,480
Lime made it through so we can see Lime's intro later.

693
00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:31,640
Like, oh, true, true.

694
00:50:32,180 --> 00:50:32,820
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

695
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:33,980
So it'll be all right.

696
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:35,280
All right.

697
00:50:35,340 --> 00:50:37,020
We're starting the match.

698
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:38,820
John VTuber.

699
00:50:39,580 --> 00:50:40,620
John Renn VTuber.

700
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:49,260
I like how she has a green screen on so, like, her fans
could insert, you know, whatever they want down there.

701
00:50:49,660 --> 00:50:52,080
Or they could just Just have the body disappear.

702
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:53,000
Yeah, yeah.

703
00:50:53,900 --> 00:50:55,640
It's just a floating head.

704
00:50:55,860 --> 00:50:57,440
Yeah, that's true.

705
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:00,240
Okay.

706
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:04,940
The following contest is scheduled for one fall.

707
00:51:05,740 --> 00:51:06,800
Introducing first.

708
00:51:09,970 --> 00:51:11,690
Oh my gosh, this is a long entry.

709
00:51:12,390 --> 00:51:13,590
The long area.

710
00:51:14,830 --> 00:51:15,090
Oh!

711
00:51:16,670 --> 00:51:18,050
Someone's dilemma.

712
00:51:18,670 --> 00:51:20,190
Umia Emma.

713
00:51:21,470 --> 00:51:23,110
Oh my gosh, she has a crown.

714
00:51:24,070 --> 00:51:25,090
She's like royalty.

715
00:51:26,030 --> 00:51:29,010
The claws, the crown, this is...

716
00:51:29,010 --> 00:51:29,890
Is that legal?

717
00:51:30,610 --> 00:51:32,630
Can she bring those claws to the ring?

718
00:51:33,970 --> 00:51:38,130
But you know, fancy get up gives you no tactical advantage
whatsoever.

719
00:51:38,730 --> 00:51:40,810
But like, do you not see her hands?

720
00:51:42,030 --> 00:51:45,790
Like, yeah, what do you mean?

721
00:51:46,410 --> 00:51:47,270
Stab her in the eye.

722
00:51:47,430 --> 00:51:48,810
That's what I'm saying.

723
00:51:48,950 --> 00:51:51,230
She can just stab her in the fucking eye.

724
00:51:51,470 --> 00:51:54,390
Oh, Your Majesty, please, come in.

725
00:51:54,810 --> 00:51:57,830
Oh, my God.

726
00:51:58,270 --> 00:52:00,130
I mean...

727
00:52:00,130 --> 00:52:02,170
Whoa, in a little battle for us.

728
00:52:02,650 --> 00:52:02,990
Your Majesty.

729
00:52:04,130 --> 00:52:09,610
No wonder so many people are coming into your dungeon in
more ways than one.

730
00:52:10,190 --> 00:52:12,250
I don't know what you mean by that.

731
00:52:18,770 --> 00:52:20,470
And introducing their opponents.

732
00:52:22,110 --> 00:52:22,790
Oh.

00:52:24,310 --> 00:52:33,010

Let's go!

743
00:53:38,510 --> 00:53:39,590
That's French!

744
00:53:45,890 --> 00:53:50,650
Wrong country mint France is across the ocean!

745
00:53:51,250 --> 00:53:59,750
Okay, well, what do you mean across the ocean and it's
technically across and the british look out into the ocean

746
00:53:59,750 --> 00:54:08,450
across from them is france they're still connected by land
no they're not british is a fucking island they're on this

747
00:54:08,450 --> 00:54:18,490
it's europe there's the same continent the uk is on the
island do you not know the uk is on an island oh wait you're

748
00:54:18,490 --> 00:54:30,620

749
00:54:30,700 --> 00:54:31,440
I shouldn't be surprised.

750
00:54:31,580 --> 00:54:33,420
You in geography, I shouldn't race.

751
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:34,640
What do you mean by that?

752
00:54:34,660 --> 00:54:36,360
And you live as well, okay?

753
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:41,300
Oh, yeah, you know all the flags in the world.

754
00:54:46,260 --> 00:54:48,640
This is why the British are losing.

755
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:50,980
You didn't even know the UK was an island.

756
00:54:51,020 --> 00:54:51,880
Hey, I'm a ghost.

757
00:54:51,900 --> 00:54:53,140
I've been dead for so long.

758
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:54,780
I only remember Pangaeo.

759
00:54:55,100 --> 00:54:56,540
Oh, so you're at the Teutonic Plates.

760
00:54:57,700 --> 00:54:59,260
Things are shifting still.

761
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:12,460
still shifting she lives in the past and the present guys
exactly time has no concept to her oh my god what wait the

762
00:55:12,460 --> 00:55:14,220
british almost pinned her

wait why why didn't emma bring her claws like it should be
so easy oh my god oh my god that's

765
00:55:40,740 --> 00:55:52,380
like rin chose the wrong dungeon that's for sure i think so
too i mean level level one mafia versus level 99 mafia is

766
00:55:52,380 --> 00:56:07,680
this even legal you're doing it all the ring ladies oh oh my

actually here is your winner someone's dilemma Emma okay

771
00:57:14,340 --> 00:57:28,140
that is sort of like really embarrassing though for the
match before it lasted like 20 years yeah you know the

772
00:57:28,140 --> 00:57:37,540
British are just you know their fighting style is too polite
I think the Viva Revolution sort of jinxed the whole thing.

773
00:57:37,540 --> 00:57:38,840
Do you want to try that again?

774
00:57:42,300 --> 00:57:46,520
Oh my god, another item member got wiped out.

775
00:57:46,860 --> 00:57:47,900
That's a little sad.

776
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:51,740
I guess we're going to go to the interview stage to talk to
you.

777
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:55,560
Yeah, let's see what Rin feels like about all of this.

778
00:57:58,780 --> 00:57:59,460
Hello.

779
00:58:00,300 --> 00:58:00,700
Hello.

780
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:03,760
That was the fastest match yet.

781
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:05,460
That was the first...

782
00:58:05,460 --> 00:58:06,920
This is the second match.

783
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:08,780
That was the first one though.

784
00:58:10,220 --> 00:58:11,760
Oh, Rin, how did it feel?

785
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:12,460
I don't...

786
00:58:12,460 --> 00:58:14,260
Like, I saw you, like, get...

787
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:16,580
I think she's funny.

788
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:17,620
I think we need an ambulance.

789
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:22,800
If anyone out there can call, I don't know what it is in the
UK, but it's 1-1-9.

790
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:24,940
I have seven concussions.

791
00:58:25,720 --> 00:58:31,040
Sorry, I accidentally punched her too much because she's so
funny with that green suit.

792
00:58:31,420 --> 00:58:31,860
I can't.

793
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:34,120
I was snorting so hard.

794
00:58:34,140 --> 00:58:36,540
It was like when a bull sees red.

795
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:40,600
You saw green and you just- How many times do you have to
punch me for it to stop?

796
00:58:41,020 --> 00:58:41,720
Because you act!

797
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:44,820
She was giving you CPR, if I- You know what they say?

798
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:47,360
The taller they are, the harder they fall.

799
00:58:50,020 --> 00:58:53,860
So, Rin Penrose, how does it feel not being in the neck?

800
00:58:54,100 --> 00:58:54,500
Painful!

801
00:58:54,740 --> 00:58:57,360
Physically, I- I think my ribs are misaligned.

802
00:58:59,460 --> 00:59:02,980
I think, um, I mean, that's part of the contract, you know?

803
00:59:03,300 --> 00:59:06,640
So- you know what you are getting here.

804
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:13,660
I think, like, you know, when we saw you in the ring, we
noticed that was not your accurate height there.

805
00:59:14,040 --> 00:59:16,560
So, like, somebody was wearing heels there.

806
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:19,160
John V-Tuber.

807
00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:26,300
Yeah, John V-Tuber, what are you doing wearing those high
heels in the wrestling match?

808
00:59:26,940 --> 00:59:27,920
Oh, have you...

809
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:28,760
No, please go ahead.

810
00:59:28,860 --> 00:59:29,020
Healies.

811
00:59:29,060 --> 00:59:29,960
That was so strange.

812
00:59:32,820 --> 00:59:36,640
Well, about how did it feel beating up the Rin Penrose?

813
00:59:39,080 --> 00:59:40,200
Uh, good.

814
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:44,920
I'm still in the room, you know?

815
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:47,100
It's so fast.

816
00:59:47,240 --> 00:59:49,580
I thought she can beat me harder, but...

817
00:59:50,060 --> 00:59:53,040
Gosh, maybe because you're British, I guess.

818
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:54,200
You know, like, there's stamina.

819
00:59:54,580 --> 00:59:56,700
Every bone in my arms are broken, Emma.

820
00:59:57,420 --> 00:59:58,900
Yeah, because apparently...

821
00:59:58,900 --> 01:00:00,800
I thought British people are so powerful.

822
01:00:00,940 --> 01:00:02,400
I can't believe you're that.

823
01:00:02,420 --> 01:00:03,780
Yeah, it's very...

824
01:00:03,780 --> 01:00:05,500
I am a small victim.

825
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:08,480
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

826
01:00:09,080 --> 01:00:09,380
It's okay.

827
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:11,820
I'll heal you with a cup of tea.

828
01:00:11,980 --> 01:00:13,260
Call 119.

829
01:00:13,720 --> 01:00:14,220
999.

830
01:00:15,300 --> 01:00:15,860
999.

831
01:00:15,860 --> 01:00:17,200
What are the numbers?

832
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:18,460
What are the three numbers?

833
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:19,480
What do they mean?

834
01:00:19,720 --> 01:00:20,200
What do they mean?

835
01:00:20,860 --> 01:00:21,560
What do they mean?

836
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:24,140
There's too many emergency numbers.

837
01:00:25,560 --> 01:00:26,120
966.

838
01:00:26,560 --> 01:00:27,120
999.

839
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:28,560

01:00:28,900 --> 01:00:39,760
six and nine nine all right congratulations to emma for

say thank you again to emma and rin for joining us rin

842
01:00:50,520 --> 01:00:59,580
you're sadly you're the second loser of the night another
idol has been eliminated from the bracket Come on, idol

843
01:00:59,580 --> 01:00:59,980
girls.

844
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:01,240
Come on, idol girls.

845
01:01:01,860 --> 01:01:05,220
So, we have actually, we have one more idol girl, right?

846
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:07,560
How many more of, we have two idol girls left.

847
01:01:08,220 --> 01:01:11,600
So, we have Juna and Fuyo left to represent Idol.

848
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:15,260
So, I wonder if Fuyo will win against Snuffy later.

849
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:16,700
I guess we'll finally see.

850
01:01:17,020 --> 01:01:17,920
We'll finally see.

851
01:01:18,360 --> 01:01:22,980
Anyway, we're going to have to kick you girls out and move
on to the next pair.

852
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:25,260
The biggest match of the night.

853
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:26,260
Oh.

854
01:01:26,900 --> 01:01:27,600
Oh, yes.

855
01:01:27,780 --> 01:01:28,240
Yeah.

856
01:01:29,100 --> 01:01:31,260
The meteor and the dinosaur.

857
01:01:32,580 --> 01:01:33,960
Nana, kick his ass!

858
01:01:34,300 --> 01:01:36,180
Nana, kick his ass!

859
01:01:36,700 --> 01:01:38,540
Thank you so much, guys!

860
01:01:38,920 --> 01:01:40,780
All right, see you later, girls.

861
01:01:42,080 --> 01:01:44,780
Can we drag in the next two?

862
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:45,700
Go get some help, Rin.

863
01:01:45,860 --> 01:01:46,920
Yeah, go get some help.

864
01:01:49,100 --> 01:01:51,160
She definitely needs it.

865
01:01:51,900 --> 01:01:53,160
I can't drag.

866
01:01:54,280 --> 01:01:55,600
Oh, wait, I should give you...

867
01:01:55,600 --> 01:01:56,780
You know, I should give you admin.

868
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:57,120
Permissions, please.

869
01:01:57,760 --> 01:01:58,600
Please, please.

870
01:01:58,900 --> 01:02:01,980
I told you, day one, it's all about figuring stuff out,
guys.

871
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:02,980
I grew.

872
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:04,320
I grew.

873
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:08,220
All right, you can ask them for now, but I'm going to give
you admin room.

874
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:09,080
All right.

875
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:14,420
Nana is saying, oh, hot, good God, ah, good, good, I think
she's nervous.

876
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:16,220
I think she's throwing up.

877
01:02:16,700 --> 01:02:17,760
Yeah, a little bit.

878
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:21,420
We're throwing up, but she made, she merely made, like, a
diss track before.

879
01:02:22,040 --> 01:02:22,660
There we go.

880
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:23,540
Oh, my God.

881
01:02:23,900 --> 01:02:26,300
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

882
01:02:29,420 --> 01:02:29,940
Hello.

883
01:02:31,840 --> 01:02:33,540
So, I've been seeing the beef on Twitter.

884
01:02:36,180 --> 01:02:38,660
We finally talk face to face.

885
01:02:39,260 --> 01:02:39,340
Nana.

886
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:40,980
Oh my God.

887
01:02:41,540 --> 01:02:45,540
I just, let me just say right now you fucking dropped the
diss track right before.

888
01:02:46,020 --> 01:02:47,520
Right before the actual match.

889
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:49,520
How fucking damn you?

890
01:02:51,260 --> 01:02:51,780
Wait.

891
01:02:52,040 --> 01:02:54,500
It's been 65 million years, Gerard.

892
01:02:54,680 --> 01:02:56,800
How we've been doing getting pregnant, I hear.

893
01:02:57,480 --> 01:02:57,960
What?

894
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:58,420
What?

895
01:02:58,900 --> 01:03:00,220
You've been doing your research.

896
01:03:00,560 --> 01:03:01,020
I see.

897
01:03:01,340 --> 01:03:02,600
The galaxy never disappoints.

898
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:03,880
You've always been watching me.

899
01:03:03,940 --> 01:03:08,420
I know you have three children who live under a bridge with
no mom, no dad, and you eat grime.

900
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:09,740
That is none of your business.

901
01:03:10,040 --> 01:03:11,580
Keep your nose out of my life.

902
01:03:11,820 --> 01:03:12,940
You tried to ruin mine.

903
01:03:13,120 --> 01:03:14,080
Now get out of it.

904
01:03:14,360 --> 01:03:15,800
I'm trying to live peacefully here.

905
01:03:15,820 --> 01:03:16,300
Oh, are you crying?

906
01:03:16,300 --> 01:03:17,340
Don't try to ruin it.

907
01:03:17,340 --> 01:03:18,560
Are you crying?

908
01:03:19,240 --> 01:03:20,260
I'm not crying.

909
01:03:20,540 --> 01:03:23,540
I'm trying to live, and I can't believe we're matched up.

910
01:03:23,820 --> 01:03:25,240
I just want to live, man.

911
01:03:25,580 --> 01:03:26,180
Like, what is this?

912
01:03:26,180 --> 01:03:27,040
This got to be rigged.

913
01:03:27,140 --> 01:03:28,160
It has to be rigged.

914
01:03:28,900 --> 01:03:36,120

you you're literally the I don't know.

918
01:03:59,780 --> 01:04:01,480
I don't know how to make a comeback about that.

919
01:04:02,200 --> 01:04:03,600
I'll just try my best.

920
01:04:04,780 --> 01:04:05,480
Holy fuck.

921
01:04:06,020 --> 01:04:06,300
Stop.

922
01:04:06,780 --> 01:04:07,820
I'm already dead.

923
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:08,400
Stop.

924
01:04:08,660 --> 01:04:10,000
The match hasn't even started yet.

925
01:04:10,180 --> 01:04:10,980
He's crying, Chad.

926
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:12,040
He's crying.

927
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:15,240
Guys, guys, cheer me on.

928
01:04:15,420 --> 01:04:18,940
Please, this is the only means of me actually fighting back.

929
01:04:20,240 --> 01:04:22,660
He needs the money from the tournament to pay for child
support.

930
01:04:23,640 --> 01:04:27,560
I heard you have a diss track that you made about Gerard.

931
01:04:28,900 --> 01:04:31,440
Can you give us a little sneak peek?

932
01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:33,320
How many hours did it take you to, like, make that?

933
01:04:33,560 --> 01:04:33,840
Holy shit.

934
01:04:34,320 --> 01:04:37,020
I made that song in 10 hours since last night.

935
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:39,440
Oh, that was last minute!

936
01:04:39,980 --> 01:04:41,820
That sounded so great, though.

937
01:04:42,360 --> 01:04:44,660
Holy shit, I thought that would, like, take a day.

938
01:04:44,920 --> 01:04:45,320
Holy crap.

939
01:04:45,800 --> 01:04:46,620
Oh, thank you.

940
01:04:46,780 --> 01:04:47,500
Oh, do you like it?

941
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:49,120
That's some pure fucking rage out there.

942
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:50,520
What the fuck did I do to you?

943
01:04:50,840 --> 01:04:52,920
Why do you have to roast me like that?

944
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:54,460
That wasn't necessary.

945
01:04:54,660 --> 01:04:56,300
I thought that would have been fucking enough.

946
01:04:56,300 --> 01:04:58,660
Acapella of the roast for us, the disc track.

947
01:04:59,740 --> 01:05:00,140
Acapella.

948
01:05:00,340 --> 01:05:04,420
Oh, by the way, the beat is like completely like made of
customs.

949
01:05:04,700 --> 01:05:05,420
So you can play it.

950
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
Oh, my God.

951
01:05:08,140 --> 01:05:09,440
Girard, what the fuck were you doing?

952
01:05:09,660 --> 01:05:11,720
This is why the Astro Whitefield tie down.

953
01:05:11,880 --> 01:05:12,540
Like, what the fuck?

954
01:05:12,740 --> 01:05:13,700
I got nothing.

955
01:05:13,840 --> 01:05:15,020
I was just starting beef.

956
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:17,320
And then I didn't know you'd be making a disc track.

957
01:05:17,480 --> 01:05:18,420
I didn't think that was a thing.

958
01:05:18,780 --> 01:05:19,780
Girard, what were you doing?

959
01:05:19,980 --> 01:05:21,440
It's been five million years.

960
01:05:21,740 --> 01:05:22,960
What were you doing, okay?

961
01:05:23,340 --> 01:05:25,440
While I was being born from the galaxy.

962
01:05:26,300 --> 01:05:26,560
Live!

963
01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:27,840
Try to live!

964
01:05:28,280 --> 01:05:32,020
After that massacre of my family, you think I'd be doing
something against the galaxy?

965
01:05:32,420 --> 01:05:32,720
Nothing!

966
01:05:33,080 --> 01:05:33,840
I'm just trying to live!

967
01:05:34,080 --> 01:05:35,120
Prioritizing my own life!

968
01:05:35,940 --> 01:05:36,660
Pick it up!

969
01:05:37,040 --> 01:05:37,760
What were you doing?

970
01:05:38,040 --> 01:05:39,240
Pick it up!

971
01:05:39,700 --> 01:05:42,760
That is why she came back to finish the job, guys.

972
01:05:43,060 --> 01:05:49,260
She noticed Geron was wasting his life after the chance she
gave him to live on.

973
01:05:49,720 --> 01:05:53,780
She noticed he was wasting his life, so she's coming back to
finish the job.

974
01:05:54,580 --> 01:05:56,280
No, but I will be winning today.

975
01:05:56,300 --> 01:06:06,420
as the movie ends with me being the victor everyone dies but
not everyone lives their life i think you're we got some

976
01:06:06,420 --> 01:06:14,460
wise words from the galaxy herself i can't tell if you're

tiny arms can't it's wailing how much money more money

979
01:06:37,800 --> 01:06:46,200
ladies come take this to the ring ladies the polls are
actually pretty surprisingly close not as actually only has

980
01:06:46,200 --> 01:06:52,580
a 57 percent of winning this match from the audience vote so
that's really crazy to see after you know you're out getting

981
01:06:52,580 --> 01:07:02,320
his ass beat verbally so You may have cooked me in the
distract section, in the beef section, but this time, I'm

982
01:07:02,320 --> 01:07:04,560
going to be putting you down in a real match.

983
01:07:04,900 --> 01:07:06,700
Nana, prepare your ass.

984
01:07:07,160 --> 01:07:07,960
You're still going down.

985
01:07:07,960 --> 01:07:09,400
Big to my shooting saw press, Gerard.

986
01:07:09,680 --> 01:07:10,220
I'll see you there.

987
01:07:10,540 --> 01:07:10,940
Oh, God.

988
01:07:11,880 --> 01:07:12,400
Enough.

989
01:07:12,800 --> 01:07:13,740
Why are you dissing me?

990
01:07:14,200 --> 01:07:14,720
Okay.

991
01:07:15,420 --> 01:07:16,980
Stop speaking my language.

992
01:07:17,240 --> 01:07:18,240
It hurts even more.

993
01:07:18,620 --> 01:07:19,180
It hurts.

994
01:07:19,660 --> 01:07:20,060
See you in the ring.

995
01:07:20,060 --> 01:07:21,660
See you guys in the ring.

996
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:24,440
We're going to join back the caster's table now.

997
01:07:26,300 --> 01:07:35,220
that shit was crazy though though oh my god they were going
out that was like a beef worth a million years not gonna lie

998
01:07:35,220 --> 01:07:42,020
i feel like i feel like i just watched uh gerard turn into
like coal it was just under that pressure i know like

999
01:07:42,020 --> 01:07:50,600
honestly i would be very surprised that gerard managed to
pull this off after what we saw today i mean even even even

1000
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:57,320
nana's guy look at her just giving salt bay yeah right like

1001
01:08:00,280 --> 01:08:02,300
T-Rash is like, I'm happy to be here.

1002
01:08:02,660 --> 01:08:03,500
Gee, Willikers.

1003

Yeah.

1004
01:08:05,380 --> 01:08:09,580
I mean, it could, everything could be lighting a fire under
his butt, you know?

1005
01:08:09,800 --> 01:08:10,620
That's true.

1006
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:12,940
We don't know how he's going to react.

1007
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:15,220
It's all, it's good.

1008
01:08:15,380 --> 01:08:16,260
It's anyone's game.

1009
01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:16,920
Yeah, yeah.

1010
01:08:17,040 --> 01:08:22,320
I just, it feels like he's like, you know, it feels like he

01:13:58,670 --> 01:13:59,210
No!

1096
01:13:59,970 --> 01:14:03,590
All she did was just pin it.

1097
01:14:03,590 --> 01:14:04,510
Slap his ass.

1098
01:14:04,970 --> 01:14:05,870
All of her.

1099
01:14:06,330 --> 01:14:08,310
That was so embarrassing.

1100
01:14:09,250 --> 01:14:09,810
Holy shit.

1101
01:14:10,350 --> 01:14:12,430

01:14:13,430 --> 01:14:14,530
Well, that was...

1104
01:14:14,530 --> 01:14:15,430
That was...

1105
01:14:15,430 --> 01:14:16,910
I mean, but was he actually losing?

1106
01:14:17,090 --> 01:14:17,490

I think it was...

1108
01:14:20,070 --> 01:14:20,750
It was...

1109
01:14:20,750 --> 01:14:22,850
We just had to let him go at that point.

1110
01:14:22,970 --> 01:14:24,090
It was just too much.

1111
01:14:25,210 --> 01:14:27,330
All right, off to the interview stage, we go.

1112
01:14:27,730 --> 01:14:28,290
All right.

1113
01:14:31,440 --> 01:14:33,160
You're a fucking sweet though.

1114
01:14:34,160 --> 01:14:36,360

01:14:36,860 --> 01:14:38,700
I put my actual statistics there.

1117
01:14:38,920 --> 01:14:41,500
My height and everything.

1118
01:14:41,880 --> 01:14:43,880
And I was fighting this big brawling dude.

1119
01:14:44,260 --> 01:14:44,980
I didn't know!

1120
01:14:45,660 --> 01:14:45,840
Oh.

1121
01:14:47,800 --> 01:14:49,860
They say it was a canon event.

1122
01:14:49,880 --> 01:14:50,580
Well, that was embarrassing.

1123
01:14:50,900 --> 01:14:52,660
Well, this track is actually true now.

1124
01:14:52,740 --> 01:14:53,400
I got buried.

1125
01:14:53,560 --> 01:14:54,400
And that's the casket.

1126
01:14:54,520 --> 01:14:55,120

I was fighting a galaxy.

1137
01:15:37,740 --> 01:15:39,420
I was just a teeny little bit dinosaur.

1138
01:15:39,880 --> 01:15:42,720

weapon.

And this is historically accurate.

1146
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:53,880
The last dino has been slain.

1147
01:15:56,140 --> 01:15:56,660

1148
01:15:56,940 --> 01:15:59,020

Shut up!

1152
01:16:06,740 --> 01:16:10,360
Jirad, all I'm saying, Jirad, is that maybe you should have
worked on a diss track.

1153
01:16:12,060 --> 01:16:12,180
What?

1154
01:16:12,680 --> 01:16:13,840
That wouldn't help.

1155
01:16:14,300 --> 01:16:16,400
That's not helping me with my fucking build.

1156
01:16:16,760 --> 01:16:17,940
I'm fucking scrawny ass.

1157
01:16:18,120 --> 01:16:21,400
Literally was like powered up by her diss track.

1158
01:16:21,780 --> 01:16:22,060
Yeah.

1159
01:16:24,680 --> 01:16:27,800
You know, all I just want to say is that I'm satisfied.

1160
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:29,300
I don't even need to win this game.

1161
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:29,860
Yeah.

1162
01:16:31,440 --> 01:16:33,520
I feel my life goal has been satisfied.

1163
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:36,120
Oh, the threats I've carried to 65 million years.

1164
01:16:36,280 --> 01:16:36,700
They've been settled.

1165
01:16:36,820 --> 01:16:37,360
I'm at peace.

1166
01:16:37,520 --> 01:16:37,960
I'm at Zen.

1167
01:16:38,420 --> 01:16:39,140

What are you doing, Don't you?

1278
01:22:48,440 --> 01:22:51,500
I was so busy listening to this conversation.

1279
01:22:51,760 --> 01:22:52,820
It was so interesting.

1280
01:22:53,240 --> 01:22:54,860
Were you not immersed?

1281
01:22:55,360 --> 01:22:58,040
No, you were just fantasizing about...

1282
01:22:58,040 --> 01:22:58,400
About what?

1283
01:22:58,960 --> 01:22:59,600
About raiding a dungeon.

1284
01:23:00,320 --> 01:23:02,060
And what does that mean?

1285
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:04,540
Going on a grand journey.

1286
01:23:04,920 --> 01:23:05,060
Oh, true.

1287
01:23:05,280 --> 01:23:06,720
And finding treasure, you know?

1288
01:23:06,720 --> 01:23:07,460
Finding treasure.

1289
01:23:07,820 --> 01:23:08,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1290
01:23:08,920 --> 01:23:10,800
And that's it, right?

1291
01:23:10,820 --> 01:23:12,420
And then becoming rich and famous.

1292
01:23:13,040 --> 01:23:13,380
Yeah.

1293
01:23:13,480 --> 01:23:14,660
That's what raiding is.

1294
01:23:15,100 --> 01:23:15,460
Yeah.

1295
01:23:15,880 --> 01:23:18,700
Find someone else's stuff and you steal it.

1296
01:23:18,760 --> 01:23:19,040
Yeah.

1297
01:23:19,420 --> 01:23:20,600
Yeah, steal their booty.

1298
01:23:21,120 --> 01:23:21,600
Yeah.

1299
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:22,380
Yeah.

1300
01:23:22,700 --> 01:23:23,220
Yeah.

1301
01:23:25,620 --> 01:23:27,500
What else could it be?

1302
01:23:27,920 --> 01:23:27,940
Nah.

1303
01:23:30,360 --> 01:23:30,760
Alright.

1304
01:23:32,080 --> 01:23:35,640
Let's head over to Lymu versus Emma.

1305
01:23:36,420 --> 01:23:37,080
Actually, I don't know.

1306
01:23:37,180 --> 01:23:40,340
They both seem like both of them at the end of the other.

1307
01:23:40,620 --> 01:23:43,020
Well, Lymu actually had like a real fight, to be fair.

1308
01:23:43,260 --> 01:23:45,480
Yeah, Lymu, I think has been the longest match so far.

1309
01:23:45,500 --> 01:23:47,420
Yeah, the longest matchup we've seen so far.

1310
01:23:47,520 --> 01:23:50,400
The other is not so much.

1311
01:23:50,540 --> 01:23:53,060
I think she's just a little sleepy, but she said she had a
match.

1312
01:23:53,240 --> 01:23:55,560
I feel, yeah, but to be fair, they're like a natural.

1313
01:23:55,780 --> 01:23:57,540
I think Lyme was a natural wrestler.

1314
01:23:57,760 --> 01:23:58,080
Not gonna lie.

1315
01:23:58,180 --> 01:23:58,700
I think so too.

1316
01:23:58,800 --> 01:23:59,520
I think so too.

1317
01:24:00,320 --> 01:24:06,060
Emma, I mean, Emma fucking destroyed Rin, but like, but it
was Rin, so.

1318
01:24:06,620 --> 01:24:10,740
The following contest is scheduled for one fall.

01:24:12,120 --> 01:24:13,320
That is round two.

1320
01:24:14,460 --> 01:24:15,340

She just woke up from a nap.

1325
01:24:23,920 --> 01:24:26,600
She looks like she's like coming from Starbucks.

1326
01:24:26,620 --> 01:24:29,480
The juiciest piece of fruit lime.

1327

Alicia.

1328
01:24:31,940 --> 01:24:35,760

Is that a sleeping bag or is that the coffin that she'll be
burying?

1334
01:24:52,400 --> 01:24:53,000

01:26:41,400 --> 01:26:41,980
Okay.

1353
01:26:42,660 --> 01:26:44,700
Oh, what a hit.

1354
01:26:45,580 --> 01:26:46,760
Starting out strong.

1355
01:26:47,860 --> 01:26:49,700
And another hit too.

1356
01:26:50,820 --> 01:26:51,760
Whoa, she's just breaking her arm.

1357
01:26:51,780 --> 01:26:52,420
Maybe she's too EP.

1358
01:26:52,780 --> 01:26:54,320
Yeah, she's too EP.

1359
01:26:56,720 --> 01:26:58,020
Oh, my God.

1360
01:26:58,160 --> 01:26:59,200
Not the arm.

1361
01:26:59,680 --> 01:27:00,300
Please.

1362
01:27:01,100 --> 01:27:02,760
What's somebody think about her?

1363
01:27:02,980 --> 01:27:05,560
How is she going to drink her coffee without arms?

1364
01:27:06,360 --> 01:27:08,540
Oh, through a straw, I guess.

1365
01:27:09,380 --> 01:27:09,820
Yeah.

1366
01:27:10,280 --> 01:27:12,280
Doffy threw a straw like...

1367
01:27:13,240 --> 01:27:16,000
Oh my god, I can't get enough of these panty shots.

1368
01:27:17,440 --> 01:27:19,980
Mint, her chest is up there!

1369
01:27:22,020 --> 01:27:24,380
Her tail is back there!

1370
01:27:26,060 --> 01:27:30,880
Mint, you're gonna look at the panty shot when you have
Emma's chest right there for you.

1371
01:27:31,700 --> 01:27:34,700
I mean, that's true, that's true, but...

1372
01:27:34,700 --> 01:27:36,060
I mean, have you not seen her measurements?

1373
01:27:36,500 --> 01:27:38,600
It's more fun when it's flash, you know?

1374
01:27:40,280 --> 01:27:41,740
You just see it a little bit.

1375
01:27:43,200 --> 01:27:45,440
Take me to the HR training here.

1376
01:27:47,260 --> 01:27:48,360
Oh, holy shit.

1377
01:27:48,960 --> 01:27:50,340
What is going on here?

1378
01:27:50,500 --> 01:27:54,280

1379
01:27:54,900 --> 01:27:55,420

01:28:00,320 --> 01:28:01,000
Oh my God.

1382
01:28:01,020 --> 01:28:03,180
I don't know what she was doing, measuring her cranium.

1383
01:28:03,580 --> 01:28:06,620
Yeah, she's like, I need to buy you a hat.

1384
01:28:06,880 --> 01:28:07,800
Let me measure.

1385
01:28:08,480 --> 01:28:10,040
I don't have a ruler.

1386
01:28:10,280 --> 01:28:11,820

01:30:12,540 --> 01:30:14,560
And when you fuck your back up, Emma shows no mercy.

1399
01:30:14,760 --> 01:30:16,120
Yeah, Emma doesn't care.

1400
01:30:16,500 --> 01:30:18,440
Oh, right on the head?

1401
01:30:18,920 --> 01:30:19,680
Holy shit.

1402
01:30:20,080 --> 01:30:21,920
Oh, she's giving us what we want.

1403
01:30:22,380 --> 01:30:22,900
One, two.

1404
01:30:23,860 --> 01:30:24,940
Oh, oh.

1405
01:30:25,480 --> 01:30:26,720
It's not over here.

1406
01:30:27,280 --> 01:30:27,560
Yeah.

1407
01:30:28,080 --> 01:30:29,960
God moves like, no, no, no.

1408
01:30:30,140 --> 01:30:31,180
We gotta show it again.

1409
01:30:31,220 --> 01:30:31,880
Oh, a second time.

1410
01:30:32,360 --> 01:30:33,980
One, one, two.

1411
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:35,180
Oh.

1412
01:30:35,820 --> 01:30:38,080
It's because the cameraman gave us the wrong angle.

1413
01:30:38,340 --> 01:30:38,760
You know?

1414
01:30:38,880 --> 01:30:39,380
Yeah, it's the truth.

1415
01:30:39,460 --> 01:30:41,200
Yeah, they got to do it again.

1416
01:30:41,780 --> 01:30:43,900
Guys, guys, the camera does not know what he's doing.

1417
01:30:44,160 --> 01:30:44,840
Like, we need a different egg.

1418
01:30:44,940 --> 01:30:46,020
Oh, my God, the grip!

1419
01:30:47,440 --> 01:30:48,720
Wait, and then the reversal?

1420
01:30:49,060 --> 01:30:49,700
And again!

1421
01:30:50,020 --> 01:30:51,100
Another pin?

1422
01:30:51,260 --> 01:30:53,400
One, two, three!

1423
01:30:54,580 --> 01:30:56,360
Oh, my God.

1424
01:30:56,500 --> 01:30:57,980
Emma is out of control.

1425
01:30:58,280 --> 01:30:59,680
Emma is out of control.

1426
01:31:00,060 --> 01:31:03,020
She is, like, obsessed with the dungeon days.

1427
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:06,900
Here is your winner, the big dilemma.

1428
01:31:09,840 --> 01:31:13,380
Oh, look at her go.

1429
01:31:13,580 --> 01:31:14,620
She's happy with another.

1430
01:31:14,780 --> 01:31:17,400
She has absorbed another dungeon raider.

1431
01:31:18,340 --> 01:31:19,320
Everybody's Dilemma.

1432
01:31:20,240 --> 01:31:21,020
Very good.

1433
01:31:24,460 --> 01:31:26,560
I didn't realize we were raiding.

1434
01:31:28,120 --> 01:31:29,080
Very good.

1435
01:31:29,260 --> 01:31:30,420
I have three stars.

1436
01:31:31,200 --> 01:31:34,680
Let me put in the wrestling app real quick.

1437
01:31:34,800 --> 01:31:35,440
Three stars.

1438
01:31:36,920 --> 01:31:38,820
It needed a little bit more work, Emma.

1439
01:31:38,820 --> 01:31:43,920
I feel like, you know, you should have positioned her in a
better, better way so that the camera would get it, you

1440
01:31:43,920 --> 01:31:44,260
know?

1441
01:31:44,700 --> 01:31:46,740
Yeah, always know your angles, come on.

1442
01:31:46,860 --> 01:31:47,660
Yeah, exactly.

1443
01:31:47,860 --> 01:31:53,000
I always know where the camera is facing, Emma, if you want
a higher rating on WrestlingTuber app.

1444
01:31:53,320 --> 01:31:55,820
All right, let's go talk to the...

1445
01:31:59,320 --> 01:32:00,880
Could have been better, you know.

1446
01:32:02,420 --> 01:32:05,500
All right, let's go talk to the ladies real quick.

1447
01:32:05,580 --> 01:32:06,180
All right.

1448
01:32:08,020 --> 01:32:08,980
Yeah, you are.

1449
01:32:12,280 --> 01:32:12,640
Hello!

1450
01:32:13,500 --> 01:32:14,260
Welcome back!

1451
01:32:15,980 --> 01:32:18,160
Lymu, how do you feel being able to sleep now?

1452
01:32:18,660 --> 01:32:19,760
It's gonna be great.

1453
01:32:20,340 --> 01:32:24,580
Like, I think maybe I should have had some extra caffeine
and save the nap for after the match, but it's okay.

1454
01:32:25,140 --> 01:32:26,120
You live and learn.

1455
01:32:26,580 --> 01:32:28,980
You live and learn and then you get your skull crushed, but
it's okay.

1456
01:32:29,420 --> 01:32:32,640
Did you like, did you enjoy being, like, having your skull
crushed by the Emma?

1457
01:32:33,220 --> 01:32:34,200
Yeah, no, it was really good.

1458
01:32:34,300 --> 01:32:34,720
I'd do it again.

1459
01:32:37,060 --> 01:32:40,160
To be fair, you try, you might do it like several times.

1460
01:32:40,180 --> 01:32:53,680
times too she keep getting step on i feel so bad i was like
stop me stop it was consensual don't worry yeah she just

1461
01:32:53,680 --> 01:32:57,520
she's just an ego she want to go home and play valorant oh
gosh

1462
01:33:02,420 --> 01:33:12,080
so so how does it feel to lose against emma sorry judah
you're supposed to say that No, I said her like basically

1463
01:33:12,080 --> 01:33:13,120
because she wants to sleep.

1464
01:33:14,580 --> 01:33:16,640
I mean, I can reword my answer, I guess.

1465
01:33:17,860 --> 01:33:20,840
I mean, say again, but with different sentences.

1466
01:33:21,100 --> 01:33:22,920
So we didn't plagiarize.

1467
01:33:23,900 --> 01:33:29,660
Yeah, no, no, it was honestly, it was honestly an honor to
get stepped on by someone so tall and muscular.

1468
01:33:31,580 --> 01:33:34,980
This doesn't mean you would let Emma be your Discord daddy.

1469
01:33:35,260 --> 01:33:35,740
Yeah.

1470
01:33:36,180 --> 01:33:37,400
Oh, come here.

1471
01:33:37,720 --> 01:33:39,280

You have to listen to your daddy right now.

1473
01:33:43,700 --> 01:33:47,820
It looks like this dungeon boss has conquered her own
dungeon.

1474
01:33:49,200 --> 01:33:49,940

Hi.

1531
01:37:43,660 --> 01:37:43,660
Hello.

1532
01:37:44,540 --> 01:37:46,420
I've been seeing the beef on Twitter.

1533
01:37:47,940 --> 01:37:50,420
You're not, sorry, you're not on the screen yet.

1534
01:37:52,200 --> 01:37:53,780
Oh, we're not there yet.

1535
01:37:53,940 --> 01:37:55,080
You're not there yet.

1536
01:37:55,740 --> 01:37:56,680
There's you.

1537
01:38:01,380 --> 01:38:02,800
It's just a head.

1538
01:38:03,180 --> 01:38:04,060
There's you.

1539
01:38:04,380 --> 01:38:06,300
Okay, you're tiny here.

1540
01:38:07,220 --> 01:38:08,720
It's an actual head.

1541
01:38:09,620 --> 01:38:09,760
Whoa.

1542
01:38:10,160 --> 01:38:11,160
Why is it just a head?

1543
01:38:12,020 --> 01:38:13,440
How did he go?

1544
01:38:13,860 --> 01:38:15,080
How did the rest of me?

1545
01:38:15,360 --> 01:38:16,820
Sorry, tight accurate.

1546
01:38:17,980 --> 01:38:18,580
There we go.

1547
01:38:20,270 --> 01:38:21,280
That's tight accurate.

1548
01:38:23,740 --> 01:38:27,100
The more you complain, the timier you get.

1549
01:38:28,080 --> 01:38:29,000
No, no, no.

1550
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:29,520
Okay, okay, I'm sorry.

1551
01:38:29,760 --> 01:38:30,060
I'm sorry.

1552
01:38:30,600 --> 01:38:31,620
That's right.

1553
01:38:33,940 --> 01:38:35,500
She's becoming chat.

1554
01:38:35,820 --> 01:38:37,420
No, it's okay.

1555
01:38:37,560 --> 01:38:39,180
She knows her place now.

1556
01:38:40,680 --> 01:38:48,060
Well, to start off, I've been watching the beef between you
guys on Twitter.com, and I'm unsure whether this is a brawl

1557
01:38:48,060 --> 01:38:50,500
or, like, something else.

1558
01:38:51,060 --> 01:38:52,360
Wait, what do you mean by that?

1559
01:38:53,220 --> 01:38:55,100
None wants to get choked, and...

1560
01:38:55,100 --> 01:38:57,680
I didn't know how to respond to that.

1561
01:38:58,580 --> 01:39:00,200
This is the perfect place for that.

1562
01:39:00,520 --> 01:39:11,940
true that's true yeah but she said please choke me mommy so
no matter what happens i lose like she wins either way but

the casting couch again.

1568
01:40:02,360 --> 01:40:05,540
I feel like this is the casting couch now.

1569
01:40:07,420 --> 01:40:07,840
Well.

1570
01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:13,800
I feel like there's some, like, very strange tension in the
air.

1571
01:40:13,940 --> 01:40:18,840
Like, I don't know if it's a sexual or I'm unsure now.

1572
01:40:19,420 --> 01:40:20,620
I don't know what to say.

1573
01:40:20,720 --> 01:40:21,760
You did this, Junio.

1574
01:40:22,220 --> 01:40:22,900

1575
01:40:22,900 --> 01:40:24,520

1585
01:40:42,480 --> 01:40:43,420
I'm not gonna choke you.

1586
01:40:43,440 --> 01:40:46,240
So what are you gonna do in order to beat Nia?

1587

I think you'll lose if you just lay...

Adon to win.

1615
01:42:19,280 --> 01:42:20,960
It's the choking buff, you know.

1616
01:42:21,080 --> 01:42:22,960
It's the choking.

1617
01:42:23,720 --> 01:42:25,540
Do you speak from experience?

1618
01:42:27,120 --> 01:42:27,920
No, no.

1619
01:42:29,180 --> 01:42:36,560
Why do you know so much wait but why do you know so much
about the choking buff I just believe that you know I think

1620
01:42:36,560 --> 01:42:45,700
anybody who is a masochist and is in wrestling they
experience the pain and it gives them a buff that I know

1621
01:42:45,700 --> 01:42:53,600
from experience oh okay oh what the hell is that oh my god

Queen Nia is here to take that throne.

1699
01:47:24,720 --> 01:47:26,960
To be fair, it won't be that hard to do.

1700
01:47:27,040 --> 01:47:28,340
He's very old.

01:47:53,980 --> 01:47:54,580
What's going on here?

1714
01:47:54,720 --> 01:47:58,180
They definitely did not put on the contacts, Mint.

1715
01:47:58,220 --> 01:48:00,260
No, not at all.

01:48:09,140 --> 01:48:10,200
And a kick to...

1719
01:48:10,200 --> 01:48:12,100
They really like kicking each other's backs.

1720
01:48:12,720 --> 01:48:14,020
Alright, come on, you can choke her.

1721
01:48:14,260 --> 01:48:15,860
Yeah, this is choking moment.

1722

Peak choke moment!

1723
01:48:18,660 --> 01:48:20,360

not giving her the satisfaction of the choke She ended up

1728
01:48:55,940 --> 01:48:57,360

1729
01:48:57,360 --> 01:48:57,940

A person in!

Okay, her face looks like the Grinch for like one second.

Did you know?

1733
01:49:08,220 --> 01:49:11,200
But her heart is not growing three sizes.

1734
01:49:11,740 --> 01:49:13,500
Oh, it's definitely not the heart.

1735
01:49:13,820 --> 01:49:14,200
No.

1736
01:49:16,740 --> 01:49:18,260

No worry.

1738
01:49:19,020 --> 01:49:22,700

1797
01:53:59,170 --> 01:54:01,030
a mistake to have you as an interview.

1798
01:54:01,210 --> 01:54:01,590

Well, non-congratulations.

1802
01:54:11,110 --> 01:54:16,930
I'm assuming that each tattoo you have on your body is each
win that you have obtained in your career.

1803
01:54:17,310 --> 01:54:19,530
So where will your next tattoo go?

I hope we have a good fight.

1866

I don't know if I'll win, but I'll try my best.

1867
01:57:56,550 --> 01:57:57,770
It has to be a fair fight.

1868
01:57:58,230 --> 01:57:59,150
It has to be a fair fight.

1869
01:57:59,170 --> 01:58:06,450
you know we have to we have to abide by the rules of nature

It's huge.

1880
01:58:38,210 --> 01:58:39,290
It doesn't really matter to Haka.

1881
01:58:40,650 --> 01:58:41,830
Haka, what do you mean?

1882
01:58:42,350 --> 01:58:43,730
He, it's you.

1883
01:58:46,990 --> 01:58:49,930
Well, you see, I like you also bring a whop in.

Wow.

1887
01:58:55,070 --> 01:58:58,970
Well, you see, when you're a performer, you kind of have to
find, you know, different options.

1888
01:58:59,170 --> 01:59:05,630
and that that guy just looked at me funny and I was just
like hey you want to make 20 bucks already admitting to

1889
01:59:05,630 --> 01:59:14,250

1895
01:59:54,050 --> 02:00:00,170

1896
02:00:02,650 --> 02:00:03,090
Alright.

1897
02:00:03,690 --> 02:00:06,350
Also, Mint, can you turn up yourself a little bit more?

1898
02:00:06,470 --> 02:00:08,770
The sound guy's saying he wants to hear you more.

1899
02:00:09,050 --> 02:00:09,830
Oh, okay.

1900
02:00:10,270 --> 02:00:10,570
Hello.

1901
02:00:10,950 --> 02:00:11,690
That was enough.

1902
02:00:12,010 --> 02:00:12,610
I don't know.

1903
02:00:13,370 --> 02:00:14,930
My ears don't work as good.

1904
02:00:16,190 --> 02:00:17,030
Me neither.

1905
02:00:19,050 --> 02:00:19,490
Alright.

1906
02:00:19,610 --> 02:00:20,090
It seems...

1907
02:00:20,090 --> 02:00:20,510
Oh my god.

1908
02:00:20,550 --> 02:00:22,050
A lot of people think Hakka's gonna win.

1909
02:00:22,170 --> 02:00:23,110
It's because he's not him.

1910
02:00:23,490 --> 02:00:25,410
I mean, like, he's pretty short, right?

1911
02:00:25,490 --> 02:00:26,750
He has those heels on.

1912
02:00:27,170 --> 02:00:27,990
Let me see.

1913
02:00:29,170 --> 02:00:31,770
Yeah, I mean, we'll see again.

1914
02:00:31,990 --> 02:00:33,350
It doesn't matter the size.

1915
02:00:33,530 --> 02:00:44,770
It matters kind of the agility like I like how he's like 2d
here like Wait, why is Haka just What Why is he just

1916
02:00:44,770 --> 02:00:45,490
himself?

1917
02:00:46,230 --> 02:00:50,030
Okay What the fuck is so short?

1918
02:00:50,170 --> 02:00:57,790
Oh my god Oh, but it doesn't matter It doesn't fucking
matter.

1919
02:00:57,990 --> 02:01:00,630
He does not need height No, exactly.

1920
02:01:00,870 --> 02:01:02,450
The taller they are, the harder they fall.

1921
02:01:03,290 --> 02:01:03,290
Exactly.

1922
02:01:03,710 --> 02:01:07,890
I mean, I don't think these, I don't think any of these
wrestlers are them.

1923
02:01:08,110 --> 02:01:09,830
Like, I think they both hired some.

1924
02:01:10,190 --> 02:01:11,390
I don't know.

1925
02:01:11,670 --> 02:01:14,270
I can't see the resemblance with Juno.

1926
02:01:14,390 --> 02:01:14,610
Who?

1927
02:01:14,890 --> 02:01:16,730
Like, how, like the furry tail?

1928
02:01:16,890 --> 02:01:17,970
It feels like Juno just...

1929
02:01:19,330 --> 02:01:20,830
The furry tail?

1930
02:01:21,050 --> 02:01:25,710
Juno gave like this random guy like $5 at Walmart to go
crazy.

1931
02:01:27,590 --> 02:01:28,890
I don't know.

1932
02:01:29,170 --> 02:01:39,490
budget the budget cosplay oh guys i just realized we didn't
do the intro guys we were so sorry we got distracted by 2d

1933
02:01:39,490 --> 02:01:46,290
haka all right should we you know i mean it's still early we
can restart it we don't know who's gonna win yeah true true

1934
02:01:46,290 --> 02:01:57,050

1935
02:01:57,050 --> 02:02:00,330
they were yeah we told them up.

1936
02:02:00,330 --> 02:02:01,890
Why is he 2D?

1937
02:02:02,770 --> 02:02:03,510
I don't know.

1938
02:02:04,010 --> 02:02:05,810
Something made him 2D.

1939
02:02:05,930 --> 02:02:09,810
I got distracted because you didn't even realize that he was
2D.

1940
02:02:09,810 --> 02:02:10,350
I didn't either.

1941
02:02:10,710 --> 02:02:12,070
Yeah, just looking at him.

1942
02:02:12,290 --> 02:02:14,810
Just a standing man emoji there.

1943
02:02:16,470 --> 02:02:18,910
Haka, Haka, you were not winning.

1944
02:02:20,270 --> 02:02:21,170
Yeah, it's true.

1945
02:02:21,170 --> 02:02:22,930
You were absolutely not winning, Haka.

1946
02:02:23,110 --> 02:02:23,370
Here we go.

1947
02:02:23,910 --> 02:02:27,530
The following contest is scheduled for one fall.

1948
02:02:29,170 --> 02:02:29,630
First!

1949
02:02:32,710 --> 02:02:34,130
I like how his friendly e-lady.

1950
02:02:34,330 --> 02:02:35,610
A bit dodgy!

1951
02:02:36,070 --> 02:02:38,970
That Judah Unagi!

1952
02:02:42,650 --> 02:02:44,430
The friendly e-lady!

1953
02:02:45,570 --> 02:02:46,630
Oh my, what?

1954
02:02:47,470 --> 02:02:50,450
I don't know, anything long and slippery.

1955
02:02:50,630 --> 02:02:51,510
I've seen those.

1956
02:02:51,630 --> 02:02:52,450
They're not very friendly.

1957
02:02:52,830 --> 02:02:55,270
Riverdale shit, like the cab thing.

1958
02:02:56,170 --> 02:02:56,290
Yeah.

1959
02:02:57,210 --> 02:02:58,550
What do you mean Riverdale?

1960
02:02:59,170 --> 02:03:01,170
Like, do you not see that fucking close-up?

1961
02:03:01,270 --> 02:03:02,470
And he's like, ah.

1962
02:03:03,170 --> 02:03:05,830
Yeah, it was like a little fan service, you know?

1963
02:03:06,310 --> 02:03:07,210
Yeah, a little bit of...

1964
02:03:07,210 --> 02:03:10,510
I mean, to be fair, she was giving the silky... This is the
slowest walk.

1965
02:03:10,710 --> 02:03:11,910
Please, can we pick it up?

1966
02:03:12,150 --> 02:03:12,630
What are you doing?

1967
02:03:12,630 --> 02:03:14,750
We have a scheduler!

1968
02:03:15,290 --> 02:03:17,410
Maybe we should have skipped the intros.

1969
02:03:17,670 --> 02:03:19,570
Why are you looking at the camera again?

1970
02:03:21,330 --> 02:03:24,830
She was just like, my eyes are here, ladies.

1971
02:03:25,510 --> 02:03:25,990
Yeah.

1972
02:03:28,450 --> 02:03:32,130
Wait, did you hear that, that lady of the audience, like,
yeah!

1973
02:03:36,030 --> 02:03:39,270
Wow, Juno, you're such your biggest fan over there!

1974
02:03:39,590 --> 02:03:40,230
Yeah!

1975
02:03:41,650 --> 02:03:43,510
Yes, girl, give us nothing!

1976
02:03:45,250 --> 02:03:47,770
That's how we like it!

1977
02:03:48,770 --> 02:03:48,790
Woo!

1978
02:03:49,710 --> 02:03:51,930
We have no standards!

1979
02:03:52,490 --> 02:03:53,370
Let's go!

1980
02:03:54,170 --> 02:03:56,510
Yeah, finally, a little bit of pizzazz.

1981
02:03:57,070 --> 02:03:57,690
Whoa!

1982
02:03:59,170 --> 02:03:59,610
Finally!

1983
02:04:01,330 --> 02:04:10,250
I can like imagine you to just be like, And introducing
their opponent, Hailing from the bathroom where they just

1984
02:04:10,250 --> 02:04:12,350
took an enormous shit!

1985
02:04:13,330 --> 02:04:13,350
Oh!

1986
02:04:14,210 --> 02:04:17,290
Waka, Waka, Benzo and Haka!

1987
02:04:19,610 --> 02:04:20,290
Whoa!

1988
02:04:22,030 --> 02:04:23,910
At least Haka's giving us something.

1989
02:04:24,610 --> 02:04:25,050
Something.

1990
02:04:26,170 --> 02:04:27,210
Oh my god.

1991
02:04:27,510 --> 02:04:29,150
He's wearing a mask too.

1992
02:04:29,790 --> 02:04:30,430
Yeah.

1993
02:04:31,470 --> 02:04:32,750
Keep it on.

1994
02:04:35,970 --> 02:04:40,090
Ladies, he leaves all of that on.

1995
02:04:47,450 --> 02:04:47,790
Yeah.

1996
02:04:48,550 --> 02:04:48,970
All right.

1997
02:04:49,370 --> 02:04:52,090
The crowd, I can't tell where the crowd is supporting right
now, you know.

1998
02:04:52,190 --> 02:04:57,690
I like how his intro was like, like one third of Gina's
intro.

1999
02:04:58,150 --> 02:04:58,330
I know.

2000
02:04:58,390 --> 02:04:59,710
That was so...

2001
02:05:01,090 --> 02:05:02,910
Oh my god.

2002
02:05:03,090 --> 02:05:03,490
All right.

2003
02:05:04,290 --> 02:05:05,490
Finally, we're back in it.

2004
02:05:08,250 --> 02:05:11,270
Oh, another throw from Hakka.

2005
02:05:12,070 --> 02:05:14,230
What does the back of Juna's shirt say?

2006
02:05:15,950 --> 02:05:16,670
Family.

2007
02:05:18,710 --> 02:05:27,310
Just so all you guys know, the ones that had, like,
fan-created wrestlers, the talents themselves chose the

2008
02:05:27,310 --> 02:05:27,650
wrestler.

2009
02:05:28,210 --> 02:05:29,690
So she specifically chose.

2010
02:05:29,710 --> 02:05:32,010
this guy that she paid off in the street.

2011
02:05:32,910 --> 02:05:34,010
Okay, okay, okay.

2012
02:05:34,090 --> 02:05:34,870
With family.

2013
02:05:35,670 --> 02:05:36,330
With family.

2014
02:05:37,310 --> 02:05:38,930
There's no family here.

2015
02:05:39,470 --> 02:05:41,770
I mean, Hakka's still, Hakka's winning still.

2016
02:05:41,930 --> 02:05:44,150
I like how he's wrestling in flip-flops, though.

2017
02:05:44,730 --> 02:05:46,070
Oh, damn, you're right.

2018
02:05:46,490 --> 02:05:46,810
Yeah.

2019
02:05:47,730 --> 02:05:49,510
This guy's ready to go to the beach.

2020
02:05:49,890 --> 02:05:51,870
Oh, the kick to the head.

2021
02:05:52,190 --> 02:05:53,230
What do you call that, Mint?

The screwy McDewey?

2025
02:05:58,910 --> 02:06:03,510

Nope.

2027
02:06:04,290 --> 02:06:07,410

2165
02:25:17,240 --> 02:25:20,820
like right before we even went to here, he didn't even
believe in his senpai.

2166
02:25:21,080 --> 02:25:25,400
He said, oh my God, I didn't even think Haka would pass
because Hall of Stars are fucking weak.

2167
02:25:25,840 --> 02:25:27,220
And you got that fucking ball.

2168
02:25:27,260 --> 02:25:29,700
Bro, you have to move for us.

2169
02:25:29,840 --> 02:25:33,820
The only one I believe in is myself and no one else.

2170
02:25:36,460 --> 02:25:38,720
Everybody dunk on him if he fucking loses, all right?

2171
02:25:39,380 --> 02:25:40,820
Congratulations, Haka, you cheater.

2172
02:25:41,620 --> 02:25:42,440
You cheated in some way.

2173
02:25:43,140 --> 02:25:45,560
But hey, Hall of Stars represent, they won.

2174
02:25:46,260 --> 02:25:50,900

02:35:10,260 --> 02:35:10,920
Look at that swagger.

2347
02:35:12,960 --> 02:35:14,360
Do we have a poll in the chat?

2348
02:35:14,480 --> 02:35:15,400
Who do you think will win?

2349
02:35:16,380 --> 02:35:18,720
She's the most swaggy angel I've ever seen.

2350
02:35:18,880 --> 02:35:20,240
Phelian Oremilia.

2351
02:35:23,260 --> 02:35:23,680
Bruh.

2352
02:35:24,760 --> 02:35:25,220
Wait, what?

2353
02:35:25,260 --> 02:35:26,460
I'm looking at two screens right now.

2354
02:35:26,580 --> 02:35:26,800
Here we go.

2355
02:35:28,120 --> 02:35:30,180
I like the color scheme here.

2356
02:35:30,240 --> 02:35:31,380
Yeah, very elegant moves though.

2357
02:35:31,420 --> 02:35:34,140
Reminds me of the good old Canada.

2358
02:35:34,160 --> 02:35:36,340
Oh Canada oh Canada.

2359
02:35:36,980 --> 02:35:38,220
Why are they all doing dance moves?

2360
02:35:38,560 --> 02:35:39,340
Did they plan this out?

2361
02:35:39,500 --> 02:35:41,780
It's like they're doing dance moves.

2362
02:35:42,080 --> 02:35:43,040
Why are they doing this?

2363
02:35:43,240 --> 02:35:46,120
Yeah, yeah, this is gonna be a dance battle right here.

2364
02:35:46,360 --> 02:35:47,060
Battle of the dance.

2365
02:35:47,080 --> 02:35:52,480
I will be super disappointed if it isn't like dance moves
that they're like a swinging at each other.

2366
02:35:53,980 --> 02:35:54,500
Ooh.

2367
02:35:55,180 --> 02:35:56,600
Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo.

2368
02:35:57,480 --> 02:35:57,480
Whoa.

2369
02:35:58,100 --> 02:35:58,620
Whoa.

2370
02:35:59,560 --> 02:36:00,680
That's flexibility.

2371
02:36:02,000 --> 02:36:03,480
Damn, damn, damn.

2372
02:36:04,160 --> 02:36:14,140
got rubber bands for arms and legs just showing off that
flexibility to the crowd showing that they are not meant to

2373
02:36:14,140 --> 02:36:22,920
be grinding as well what the heck oh wow i'll give in that
oh and it doesn't end there it just keeps going it just

2374
02:36:22,920 --> 02:36:31,080
keeps going oh finally the match is starting it's just they
have to like um perform like uh they're on like on stage

2375
02:36:31,080 --> 02:36:34,620
performers in a sense they're technically This is real.

2376
02:36:34,900 --> 02:36:35,220
They're not fake.

2377
02:36:35,580 --> 02:36:36,500
They're not fake.

2378
02:36:36,740 --> 02:36:37,480
This is a real fight.

2379
02:36:37,580 --> 02:36:37,840
And the matchup begins.

2380
02:36:38,300 --> 02:36:38,860
Oh my God.

2381
02:36:39,580 --> 02:36:39,900
Immediately.

2382
02:36:41,040 --> 02:36:41,960
With a running attack.

2383
02:36:42,840 --> 02:36:44,820
And with a counter right there, bouncing off.

2384
02:36:44,940 --> 02:36:45,940
And got caught.

2385
02:36:46,860 --> 02:36:47,700
And an attack.

2386
02:36:48,280 --> 02:36:49,660
Oh, I thought that was going to be a combo.

2387
02:36:51,140 --> 02:36:53,040
And they're doing a six twist.

2388
02:36:53,040 --> 02:36:54,900
He's so aggressive already at the start.

2389
02:36:55,540 --> 02:36:56,800
An arm bar, everybody.

2390
02:36:56,880 --> 02:36:57,280
And the submission.

2391
02:36:57,720 --> 02:36:58,480
Out of the way.

2392
02:37:00,780 --> 02:37:01,920
Oh, kick to the leg.

2393
02:37:02,320 --> 02:37:03,860
Oh, oh, that hurts.

2394
02:37:04,160 --> 02:37:05,800
Look at those combos, man.

2395
02:37:06,280 --> 02:37:07,260
Oh, come to the corner.

2396
02:37:07,920 --> 02:37:12,080
A close line!

2397
02:37:12,540 --> 02:37:12,540
Yes!

2398
02:37:12,820 --> 02:37:14,100
It's the only move I know!

2399
02:37:14,380 --> 02:37:14,380
One!

2400
02:37:15,120 --> 02:37:15,560
Two!

2401
02:37:15,840 --> 02:37:17,700
Oh, no, no, no.

2402
02:37:17,820 --> 02:37:18,260
Still too early.

2403
02:37:18,900 --> 02:37:19,820
Too early, too early.

2404
02:37:20,040 --> 02:37:22,120
But, you know, that would be funny, though, if they actually
got a pin!

2405
02:37:22,560 --> 02:37:22,940
Whoa!

2406
02:37:24,840 --> 02:37:25,280
Reversal!

2407
02:37:27,160 --> 02:37:28,320
They're taking turns here.

2408
02:37:28,320 --> 02:37:28,520
Ah!

2409
02:37:29,000 --> 02:37:30,080
Focusing on the hands.

2410
02:37:30,720 --> 02:37:31,560
Gonna injure that hand.

2411
02:37:32,140 --> 02:37:37,620
And me to the face that's got a gotta say that's pretty
smart move actually like aiming for the arms because they

2412
02:37:37,620 --> 02:37:43,900
can't actually yeah aim for the limbs nor punch anyone else
if they actually damage true true yeah they can grab the

2413
02:37:43,900 --> 02:37:51,960
rope when you pin them too oh a flying attack and a ddt oh
it wasn't a ddt i thought it was a d it was an elbow it was

2414
02:37:51,960 --> 02:38:03,140
an elbow the subverted expectations oh a kick oh is that
allowed what's going on oh whoa everyone's doing some flashy

2415
02:38:03,140 --> 02:38:12,000
moves and everybody's like somersaulting one one two oh i
thought that was already it that was early but a two count

2416
02:38:12,000 --> 02:38:23,240
this early damn and he escaped oh trying to run away from
the responsibilities huh oh reversal let's see if you can

2417
02:38:23,240 --> 02:38:29,520
fly away with this one with those wings of yours and
carrying Oh, someone's bleeding!

2418
02:38:29,920 --> 02:38:30,880
That drew some blood!

2419
02:38:31,300 --> 02:38:31,740
We got first blood!

2420
02:38:32,260 --> 02:38:33,380
First blood!

2421
02:38:33,740 --> 02:38:36,500
Philean is bleeding from the nose!

2422
02:38:36,900 --> 02:38:36,980
Oh!

2423
02:38:37,420 --> 02:38:38,340
One of those things again.

2424
02:38:38,800 --> 02:38:40,120
The complicated, simplistic thing.

2425
02:38:40,340 --> 02:38:43,580
Remilia and Philean fight is already intense.

2426
02:38:43,720 --> 02:38:47,420
There's already blood gushing out through the ring, and are
they gonna get counted out?

2427
02:38:47,720 --> 02:38:48,440
Five seconds!

2428
02:38:49,360 --> 02:38:51,270
They have additional five seconds until...

2429
02:38:51,740 --> 02:38:53,880
If you kick an angel like that...

2430
02:38:53,880 --> 02:38:53,940
One gets decided to be the victor.

2431
02:38:54,880 --> 02:38:55,980
Throw inside the ring.

2432
02:38:58,340 --> 02:39:00,440
Oh, what's gonna happen?

2433
02:39:00,980 --> 02:39:01,680
Reversal please?

2434
02:39:02,020 --> 02:39:03,560
Oh, it wasn't a finisher.

2435
02:39:03,840 --> 02:39:04,480
That's it, it's a pin!

2436
02:39:05,420 --> 02:39:06,860
What a flashy pin!

2437
02:39:07,440 --> 02:39:08,300
Ah, that was quick!

2438
02:39:09,020 --> 02:39:09,580
Too quick!

2439
02:39:11,720 --> 02:39:12,520
Throwing it.

2440
02:39:13,080 --> 02:39:14,040
And another one!

2441
02:39:15,000 --> 02:39:17,640
Could you please stop hitting me on the neck?

2442
02:39:18,200 --> 02:39:20,480
Damn, look at these flashy ass moves!

2443
02:39:20,920 --> 02:39:21,860
Oh, it's a submission!

2444
02:39:22,040 --> 02:39:22,600
It's a submission!

2445
02:39:24,420 --> 02:39:26,620
Damn, but it was able to grapple free.

2446
02:39:26,720 --> 02:39:27,700
I mean, get free.

2447
02:39:28,080 --> 02:39:36,400
I've only been seeing like a big bodied men fighting, but
I've never seen like a these builds before, fight.

2448
02:39:37,100 --> 02:39:41,680
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think there's the first like
a very fast-paced kind of movement like a fight.

2449
02:39:42,940 --> 02:39:46,280
Yeah, yeah, we got thin representation from Philean right
now.

2450
02:39:46,800 --> 02:39:48,780
Everybody's big, bulky and muscly.

2451
02:39:49,540 --> 02:39:51,340
Oh, shit, that's gotta hurt.

2452
02:39:51,340 --> 02:39:51,580
Hey.

2453
02:39:52,580 --> 02:39:53,480
Oh, reversal.

2454
02:39:53,760 --> 02:39:54,220
Throw him.

2455
02:39:55,200 --> 02:39:55,720
Drop kick.

2456
02:39:55,880 --> 02:39:56,700
What is going to happen?

2457
02:39:57,500 --> 02:39:57,940
Come on, come on.

2458
02:39:58,080 --> 02:40:00,340
Ah, Somersault, kick to the face!

2459
02:40:00,780 --> 02:40:02,160
Oh my god, that works!

2460
02:40:02,780 --> 02:40:03,700
That might be it!

2461
02:40:03,960 --> 02:40:04,620
That might be it!

2462
02:40:04,740 --> 02:40:05,080
Oh no!

2463
02:40:05,160 --> 02:40:06,140
She's waiting for the finisher!

2464
02:40:06,340 --> 02:40:07,140
The default finisher!

2465
02:40:07,380 --> 02:40:08,180
Default finisher!

2466
02:40:08,920 --> 02:40:09,180
Yeah!

2467
02:40:10,100 --> 02:40:11,000
And here it is!

2468
02:40:11,040 --> 02:40:11,380
Ah!

2469
02:40:11,900 --> 02:40:12,920
That's the finisher right there!

2470
02:40:12,920 --> 02:40:13,420
Kick to the face!

2471
02:40:13,500 --> 02:40:14,920
Are they down for the count?

2472
02:40:15,040 --> 02:40:16,120
Is this set for Philly?

2473
02:40:16,340 --> 02:40:16,580
One!

2474
02:40:16,920 --> 02:40:17,900
Are they gonna win?

2475
02:40:18,020 --> 02:40:18,440
One!

2476
02:40:18,920 --> 02:40:19,400
Two!

2477
02:40:20,120 --> 02:40:20,400
Ah!

2478
02:40:20,580 --> 02:40:21,560
Kick to the what?

2479
02:40:23,800 --> 02:40:24,600
Hey, yo!

2480
02:40:24,600 --> 02:40:25,180
Fucking double!

2481
02:40:25,260 --> 02:40:25,860
That's fire!

2482
02:40:26,160 --> 02:40:26,660
Let's go!

2483
02:40:26,880 --> 02:40:27,660
Another pin!

2484
02:40:28,080 --> 02:40:29,060
Oh, they're pinned!

2485
02:40:29,300 --> 02:40:30,300
It's maybe it!

2486
02:40:30,300 --> 02:40:30,700
Two!

2487
02:40:31,320 --> 02:40:31,460
Oh!

2488
02:40:31,700 --> 02:40:32,580
Fighting back!

2489
02:40:32,920 --> 02:40:33,800
She's so strong!

2490
02:40:33,840 --> 02:40:34,500
Hang in there!

2491
02:40:35,000 --> 02:40:35,560
Escape the wall!

2492
02:40:36,000 --> 02:40:36,580
Oh, you missed!

2493
02:40:36,720 --> 02:40:38,060
Oh, that's pretty embarrassing.

2494
02:40:38,260 --> 02:40:39,480
I don't think that's...

2495
02:40:39,480 --> 02:40:40,080
Unfortunately.

2496
02:40:41,680 --> 02:40:43,300
Sponsored by Gamer Subs, everybody.

2497
02:40:43,800 --> 02:40:44,000
Ah!

2498
02:40:44,760 --> 02:40:45,320
Oh!

2499
02:40:46,540 --> 02:40:46,820
Pin!

2500
02:40:47,060 --> 02:40:47,520
Reversal!

2501
02:40:47,660 --> 02:40:48,640
Very aggressive with those pins.

2502
02:40:48,700 --> 02:40:49,120
Let's go!

2503
02:40:49,820 --> 02:40:50,100
Two!

2504
02:40:50,920 --> 02:40:51,480
Oh!

2505
02:40:53,840 --> 02:40:56,280
Phyllian is actually stronger than she looks.

2506
02:40:57,240 --> 02:41:06,380
as a dancer her limbs are very limber two finishers isn't
enough to bring one down this is a very fast paced battle it

2507
02:41:06,380 --> 02:41:20,020
is it's like watching an anime fight oh oh here we go again
oh crap what is that athleticism flexibility on display that

2508
02:41:20,020 --> 02:41:27,160
was something it was nice very nice Amelia escaping through
the turnbuckles throwing him again what is the second Oh,

2509
02:41:27,240 --> 02:41:30,220
this is crazy.

2510
02:41:31,140 --> 02:41:34,520
How can one person have such athleticism and agility?

2511
02:41:35,400 --> 02:41:37,320
Everyone here is a high flyer and a pin.

2512
02:41:37,740 --> 02:41:38,060
A pin.

2513
02:41:38,480 --> 02:41:38,920
Here it is.

2514
02:41:39,040 --> 02:41:39,700
Is this a finisher?

2515
02:41:39,920 --> 02:41:40,400
Is this it?

2516
02:41:40,660 --> 02:41:42,820
One, two, three.

2517
02:41:43,200 --> 02:41:43,980
Oh, there's nothing.

2518
02:41:44,200 --> 02:41:44,760
They counted out.

2519
02:41:44,880 --> 02:41:47,660
Oh, this is still anybody's game.

2520
02:41:48,680 --> 02:41:48,680
Anybody.

2521
02:41:48,820 --> 02:41:49,580
Oh, another finisher.

2522
02:41:50,060 --> 02:41:50,390
Another finisher.

2523
02:41:51,480 --> 02:41:51,520
Finisher.

2524
02:41:51,660 --> 02:41:52,180
Wait for that finisher.

2525
02:41:52,560 --> 02:41:53,160
Oh, you missed.

2526
02:41:53,440 --> 02:41:53,860
They missed.

2527
02:41:54,340 --> 02:41:54,380
They missed.

2528
02:41:57,200 --> 02:41:57,760
What?

2529
02:41:59,060 --> 02:41:59,640
Excuse me.

2530
02:42:00,180 --> 02:42:00,520
Okay.

2531
02:42:01,320 --> 02:42:01,860
A body slam.

2532
02:42:02,440 --> 02:42:03,560
I'm having trouble breathing.

2533
02:42:04,920 --> 02:42:05,820
That's a body slam.

2534
02:42:06,900 --> 02:42:07,040
Okay.

2535
02:42:07,220 --> 02:42:07,920
Wait, let me mute.

2536
02:42:11,320 --> 02:42:13,140
He is about...

2537
02:42:13,140 --> 02:42:16,280
Gerard, my co-caster is about to die, apparently.

2538
02:42:17,000 --> 02:42:18,680
Oh, hi, flyer, Amelia.

2539
02:42:19,160 --> 02:42:20,560
There's so much energy going on.

2540
02:42:20,700 --> 02:42:21,480
I can't help it.

2541
02:42:22,740 --> 02:42:23,540
Breathe, breathe.

2542
02:42:24,340 --> 02:42:25,720
I'm breathing, I'm breathing.

2543
02:42:26,180 --> 02:42:27,640
Oh shit, is this it?

2544
02:42:27,700 --> 02:42:29,420
If you don't breathe, Gerard, I'm going to pin you down.

2545
02:42:29,880 --> 02:42:32,260
Oh, that's the same finisher that I got wiped.

2546
02:42:32,780 --> 02:42:33,840
Oh shit, oh shit.

2547
02:42:34,300 --> 02:42:36,920
Oh, hit to the back.

2548
02:42:37,500 --> 02:42:38,340
Kind of disrespectful.

2549
02:42:38,840 --> 02:42:42,060
You could have pinned him already, but no, you had to do it
outside.

2550
02:42:43,040 --> 02:42:44,340
The disrespect is immense.

2551
02:42:44,820 --> 02:42:46,000
Could we please just end this?

2552
02:42:46,600 --> 02:42:47,280
Oh, someone's...

2553
02:42:47,280 --> 02:42:47,800

2555
02:42:49,180 --> 02:42:52,360
The angel flew around Billy in there.

2556
02:42:53,460 --> 02:42:55,760
The disrespect, put an end to it, please.

2557
02:42:57,020 --> 02:43:03,580

inside or else come on what's gonna be disqualified five

2561

Here is your winner.

02:43:30,400 --> 02:43:31,980
One in a billion.

2563
02:43:34,740 --> 02:43:35,340
Billion.

2564
02:43:38,100 --> 02:43:40,080
That was fucking intense.

2565
02:43:41,400 --> 02:43:42,780
Everyone was like flying.

2566
02:43:43,220 --> 02:43:45,700
They were like throwing punches, like throwing kicks.

2567
02:43:46,000 --> 02:43:47,800
Everyone was throwing each other at whatever.

2568
02:43:48,180 --> 02:43:49,400
That was fucking fun.

2569
02:43:49,880 --> 02:43:50,240
Holy crap.

2570
02:43:50,560 --> 02:43:52,000
We got that massive flex.

2571
02:43:52,200 --> 02:43:53,640
We got high flyers.

2572
02:43:54,240 --> 02:43:54,480
Mm-hmm.

2573
02:43:54,620 --> 02:43:56,100

02:44:22,560 --> 02:44:32,960

hell of a drug, I'm not trying to say anything, but it was

2577
02:44:32,960 --> 02:44:33,620
easier than it looked.

2578
02:44:33,780 --> 02:44:34,500
I'm not going to lie.

2579
02:44:34,880 --> 02:44:35,580
Oh, wow.

2580
02:44:36,100 --> 02:44:38,880
I mean, looking at the matches, it seemed very close.

2581
02:44:39,900 --> 02:44:40,320
I don't know.

2582
02:44:40,440 --> 02:44:42,400
Well, you know, I like to put on a good show at the end of
the day.

2583
02:44:42,500 --> 02:44:44,580
You know, it's a little bit about giving them a bit of a
chance.

2584
02:44:44,940 --> 02:44:45,600
The content.

2585
02:44:45,780 --> 02:44:46,460
I get it.

2586
02:44:46,540 --> 02:44:47,200
This makes sense.

2587
02:44:47,520 --> 02:44:47,780
Yeah, yeah.

2588
02:44:47,860 --> 02:44:50,020
I was sent back on the start so I could come back on the
ninth.

2589
02:44:50,140 --> 02:44:50,560
You know what I'm saying?

2590
02:44:51,860 --> 02:44:52,460
Yeah, I get it.

2591

Introduce yourself, Shinri.

Alright, let me try and translate that to everyone who can't
get anything under a base level.

2696
02:50:25,730 --> 02:50:28,450
My name's Joe Suichi Shinri, and I'm gonna get my ass
kicked.

2697
02:50:29,170 --> 02:50:29,610
Oh!

2698
02:50:30,010 --> 02:50:30,270
Oh!

2699
02:50:32,110 --> 02:50:33,830
Are you really going to take that Shinri?

2700
02:50:34,150 --> 02:50:34,670
Come on!

2701
02:50:34,970 --> 02:50:36,610
Hey, listen, I don't appreciate that.

2702
02:50:36,770 --> 02:50:37,410
I don't like that.

2703
02:50:37,630 --> 02:50:38,490
You said that about me.

2704
02:50:39,170 --> 02:50:39,790
Oh, I'm sorry.

2705
02:50:39,990 --> 02:50:40,170
I'm sorry.

2706
02:50:40,410 --> 02:50:41,950
Why are you so polite?

2707
02:50:42,530 --> 02:50:44,090
Hey, Shinri, you're going to try.

2708
02:50:44,390 --> 02:50:45,470
Smack talk, Kamsara.

2709
02:50:46,050 --> 02:50:46,910
No, I'm Josu Shinri.

2710
02:50:47,190 --> 02:50:48,230
I don't smack talk.

2711
02:50:49,350 --> 02:50:52,310
You see, there are two kinds of people that we're looking at
here.

2712
02:50:52,530 --> 02:50:54,130
So there's two different situations.

2713
02:50:54,510 --> 02:50:59,030
Like, if we walked onto a plane, Shinri, I would be a pilot
and you would be be a passenger.

2714
02:51:00,150 --> 02:51:01,010
I'm an innovator.

2715
02:51:01,570 --> 02:51:02,390
You're an imitator.

2716
02:51:02,550 --> 02:51:06,690
I'm a leader and you are, you're a follower.

2717
02:51:07,090 --> 02:51:13,810
See, I'm a winner and everyone else here are losers for
believing in one thing.

2718
02:51:14,490 --> 02:51:18,150
They believe that Josuichi Shinri can beat me at my own
game.

2719
02:51:18,270 --> 02:51:19,270
Are you kidding me?

2720
02:51:19,770 --> 02:51:20,850
I'm the best.

2721
02:51:21,410 --> 02:51:22,390
Except being a pilot.

2722
02:51:23,670 --> 02:51:24,070
A pilot.

2723
02:51:24,530 --> 02:51:25,210
Oh my god.

2724
02:51:26,890 --> 02:51:28,470
I'm going to fly this plane.

2725
02:51:28,490 --> 02:51:37,070
and land it directly into that ring on top of that eager
because I am going to smash it down into a crisp.

2726
02:51:37,070 --> 02:51:37,430
Whoa.

2727
02:51:38,090 --> 02:51:39,590
This sounds like you're a great pilot.

2728
02:51:39,990 --> 02:51:40,130
Oh.

2729
02:51:41,210 --> 02:51:43,550
This was a war game.

2730
02:51:44,130 --> 02:51:45,270
Reverse dissing.

2731
02:51:45,450 --> 02:51:46,750
I just understand.

2732
02:51:47,150 --> 02:51:50,230
You said you're a good pilot and apparently it's got blow up
on the ring.

2733
02:51:50,430 --> 02:51:51,030
I don't understand.

2734
02:51:52,030 --> 02:51:54,990
And everyone's going to come out safely onto the tarmac.

2735
02:51:55,750 --> 02:51:56,950
It's a metal horse, Henry.

2736
02:51:57,550 --> 02:51:58,470
It's a metal horse.

2737
02:51:59,010 --> 02:52:01,410
Okay, that's surpassed my knowledge.

2738
02:52:02,850 --> 02:52:03,810
He's a little bit sick.

2739
02:52:04,170 --> 02:52:04,770
I'm sorry, guys.

2740
02:52:04,970 --> 02:52:05,350
He's a little sick.

2741
02:52:05,750 --> 02:52:06,450
Yeah, I'm not feeling good.

2742
02:52:06,450 --> 02:52:07,070
Sorry about that, I guess.

2743
02:52:07,510 --> 02:52:08,050
A little bit slow.

2744
02:52:08,910 --> 02:52:10,490
Hey, hey, hey, I'm not slow.

2745
02:52:10,830 --> 02:52:11,830
I'm fast.

2746
02:52:12,530 --> 02:52:13,770
I'm going to be the quickest one in the ring.

2747
02:52:13,810 --> 02:52:16,350
I guess we'll find out in the match whether you're slow or
fast.

2748
02:52:16,350 --> 02:52:20,130
The only way that you're getting out of this ring is by
tapping out or passing out.

2749
02:52:20,690 --> 02:52:25,710
See, my wrestler is a fusion of myself and a very
aggressively Bogan Snake.

2750
02:52:26,330 --> 02:52:29,790
And once this Boa constricts you, That's it.

2751
02:52:30,730 --> 02:52:30,970
Wow.

2752
02:52:31,510 --> 02:52:35,070
Well, the only way you're heading out of this ring is by
ambulance.

2753
02:52:35,930 --> 02:52:36,330
Oh.

2754
02:52:36,990 --> 02:52:37,390
Whoa.

2755
02:52:37,950 --> 02:52:40,150
What happened to the, what happened to the nice guy, Shinri?

2756
02:52:40,250 --> 02:52:41,150
I thought you were right.

2757
02:52:42,310 --> 02:52:43,110
What happened?

2758
02:52:43,530 --> 02:52:43,970
Oh, shit.

2759
02:52:44,230 --> 02:52:44,990
Nobody says so much.

2760
02:52:46,370 --> 02:52:46,770
Yeah.

2761
02:52:46,930 --> 02:52:51,750
It'll be, uh, I'll be in the ambulance, uh, trash talking
you while you're in the stretcher.

2762
02:52:51,970 --> 02:52:54,330
So let's, uh, let's see how it goes.

2763
02:52:54,510 --> 02:52:54,950
All right, Shinri.

2764
02:52:55,210 --> 02:52:58,090
Let's, uh, let's save the, uh, trash dog act for later.

2765
02:52:58,210 --> 02:52:58,410
All right.

2766
02:52:58,490 --> 02:52:59,430
Yeah, yeah, sounds good.

2767
02:52:59,710 --> 02:52:59,710
Great.

2768
02:52:59,970 --> 02:53:00,550
I'm a Jo Suiji Shinri.

2769
02:53:03,470 --> 02:53:04,830
Definitely Jo Suiji Shinri here.

2770
02:53:06,250 --> 02:53:06,710
That is him.

2771
02:53:06,810 --> 02:53:07,190
That is him.

2772
02:53:07,670 --> 02:53:08,610
I can vouch for him.

2773
02:53:08,730 --> 02:53:13,350
Oh, Shinri, kindly give a Koinichiwa to your fans watching
here right now for you.

2774
02:53:14,250 --> 02:53:15,090
Oh, yeah, absolutely.

2775
02:53:15,710 --> 02:53:16,790
Koinichiwa, everybody.

2776
02:53:17,170 --> 02:53:21,410
Jo Suiji Shinri here to do a fight and ready to go.

2777
02:53:21,610 --> 02:53:21,950
Feeling great.

2778
02:53:22,330 --> 02:53:22,670
Feeling fresh.

2779
02:53:23,690 --> 02:53:24,930
Yeah, let's fucking go.

2780
02:53:25,370 --> 02:53:26,690
Let's fucking go, everybody.

2781
02:53:27,290 --> 02:53:28,470
The match of the century.

2782
02:53:28,490 --> 02:53:32,050
between a plane and a Ronin.

2783
02:53:32,290 --> 02:53:33,230
Let's see who comes out.

2784
02:53:33,710 --> 02:53:35,810
A plane and a Ronin.

2785
02:53:35,990 --> 02:53:36,190
I am.

2786
02:53:36,430 --> 02:53:38,330
That's what I got from the entire conversation.

2787
02:53:41,750 --> 02:53:43,770
Let's go back into the ring.

2788
02:53:44,290 --> 02:53:44,670
Let's go.

2789
02:53:44,670 --> 02:53:48,790
And the next match, bulk Bogan and Chinri.

2790
02:53:49,730 --> 02:53:50,050
What the?

2791
02:53:50,670 --> 02:53:51,950
What in the scuba diver?

2792
02:53:52,810 --> 02:53:55,030
So is there a scuba diver here?

2793
02:53:55,610 --> 02:53:57,230
Chinri, what happened?

2794
02:53:59,170 --> 02:54:00,590
What is that pose?

2795
02:54:01,550 --> 02:54:05,670
Bogan on that huge bulk and Chinri diving in that deep.

2796
02:54:06,330 --> 02:54:06,670
My goodness.

2797
02:54:07,290 --> 02:54:09,570
Bogan in a pilot outfit too?

2798
02:54:10,790 --> 02:54:15,130
I gotta say though, Chinri is on Brad because he's creeping
up on them opponents like sneaky style, like one of his

2799
02:54:15,130 --> 02:54:15,990
horror games.

2800
02:54:16,570 --> 02:54:17,550
He's into that one, right?

2801
02:54:17,930 --> 02:54:22,670
The following contest is scheduled for one fall.

2802
02:54:25,430 --> 02:54:26,450
Introduce a first.

2803
02:54:27,750 --> 02:54:28,470
Oh shit, we got to talk.

2804
02:54:29,670 --> 02:54:40,770
Presenting somewhat harder than the Sahara from where things
get gory, the gory Sarah Bulk Bogan!

2805
02:54:44,310 --> 02:54:45,230
Thank you so much, announcer.

2806
02:54:45,490 --> 02:54:45,990
That was great.

2807
02:54:46,170 --> 02:54:47,030
Thank you, thank you.

2808
02:54:47,230 --> 02:54:50,650
And I can't help but look at the fucking toxic one in the
Jumbo Tron.

2809
02:54:51,230 --> 02:54:51,790
Look at that!

2810
02:54:51,870 --> 02:54:52,150
What the hell?

2811
02:54:53,010 --> 02:54:55,210
Very vocal about the intentions here.

2812
02:54:55,610 --> 02:54:57,630
Out here to fucking destroy Shinri.

2813
02:54:57,870 --> 02:54:57,890
Poison.

2814
02:54:58,370 --> 02:54:59,150
Just poison air.

2815
02:54:59,350 --> 02:55:00,310
Not joking around.

2816
02:55:00,670 --> 02:55:02,270
Bulk Bogan showing up.

2817
02:55:02,570 --> 02:55:04,190
And oh my god!

2818
02:55:04,810 --> 02:55:06,230
With a thunderous entrance.

2819
02:55:06,590 --> 02:55:11,130
Squatting down and announcing to the world that he is here!

2820
02:55:11,990 --> 02:55:14,510
Bulk Bogan better be thankful that she's not a ghost.

2821
02:55:15,430 --> 02:55:16,130
Oh my goodness.

2822
02:55:16,150 --> 02:55:18,550
This character reminds me.

2823
02:55:19,190 --> 02:55:22,630
Yeah, it reminds me of like a Hercules.

2824
02:55:23,050 --> 02:55:23,530
Oh my god.

2825
02:55:23,850 --> 02:55:24,490
Because of that.

2826
02:55:25,570 --> 02:55:25,970
Intense.

2827
02:55:26,050 --> 02:55:26,430
What are you doing?

2828
02:55:26,830 --> 02:55:27,210
What are you doing?

2829
02:55:27,470 --> 02:55:28,070
What are you doing?

2830
02:55:28,210 --> 02:55:29,130
I was going to go to the ring.

2831
02:55:29,650 --> 02:55:30,030
You need to walk.

2832
02:55:30,170 --> 02:55:32,370
An intimidation factor towards shit.

2833
02:55:32,530 --> 02:55:33,210
Oh, what the hell?

2834
02:55:33,810 --> 02:55:35,090
Hey, yo, hey, yo.

2835
02:55:35,170 --> 02:55:35,730
Hey, yo.

2836
02:55:36,030 --> 02:55:37,050
Someone's crawling too.

2837
02:55:37,330 --> 02:55:37,770
What the?

2838
02:55:38,490 --> 02:55:40,550
Is that the impersonation of a snake?

2839
02:55:41,250 --> 02:55:41,730
What's going on?

2840
02:55:41,810 --> 02:55:43,010
Is that how a pilot walks?

2841
02:55:43,630 --> 02:55:43,810
Oh.

2842
02:55:45,170 --> 02:55:46,010
Come on, man.

2843
02:55:46,150 --> 02:55:46,410
Fly.

2844
02:55:47,570 --> 02:55:47,870
Come on.

2845
02:55:47,870 --> 02:55:48,250
Move.

2846
02:55:48,590 --> 02:55:48,890
Oh.

2847
02:55:49,530 --> 02:55:50,390
They're not moving.

2848
02:55:50,670 --> 02:55:50,970
They are.

2849
02:55:51,590 --> 02:55:53,110
This is probably the longest.

2850
02:55:53,330 --> 02:55:53,950
Fly towards the ring.

2851
02:55:53,950 --> 02:56:06,850
like you said there we go there we go the landing sure is
something big necktie it's really wide the short shorts be

2852
02:56:06,850 --> 02:56:12,230
doing something oh wow wow do it oh look at that guy

2853
02:56:18,150 --> 02:56:27,130
yo they're still sticking to the animalistic behavior though
this is a really long intro yes it is there's a lot of parts

2854
02:56:27,130 --> 02:56:32,930
to this uh choreography oh oh wow wow getting the crowd

2855
02:56:36,670 --> 02:56:45,790
pumped what she's gonna probably do to shinri is a pump and
dump is what i'm talking about okay a quick pump and dump

2856
02:56:45,790 --> 02:56:55,930
them down i hope that's the finisher of their moves Oh no, I
think Shinri might mistake her for a monster or something,

2857
02:56:56,170 --> 02:56:57,070
for a ghost or goole.

2858
02:56:57,410 --> 02:56:58,470
What is happening here?

2859
02:56:58,590 --> 02:56:59,490
It's still going on?

2860
02:56:59,690 --> 02:57:00,410
What the hell?

2861
02:57:00,570 --> 02:57:01,450
It's still going on.

2862
02:57:01,610 --> 02:57:02,050
Oh my god!

2863
02:57:02,330 --> 02:57:03,430
You're still crawling?

2864
02:57:03,870 --> 02:57:04,330
Stop it!

2865
02:57:04,530 --> 02:57:05,710
We get it!

2866
02:57:11,750 --> 02:57:13,130
I'm a pilot.

2867
02:57:15,650 --> 02:57:16,830
That's definitely not good for her back.

2868
02:57:17,510 --> 02:57:18,050
There's still...

2869
02:57:18,050 --> 02:57:18,290
Okay.

a boy failure spree the bloating rodan

2873
02:57:51,110 --> 02:57:53,010
I got shot there.

2874
02:57:53,670 --> 02:57:54,930
Why'd you have to say that now, sir?

2875
02:57:55,170 --> 02:57:56,730
How I see his briefs.

2876
02:57:58,410 --> 02:58:04,750
And there's a shirt saying KO, declaring victory right at
once without even saying it.

2877
02:58:05,550 --> 02:58:07,050
We got like a fishnets.

2878
02:58:07,630 --> 02:58:07,850
Fishnets.

2879
02:58:08,130 --> 02:58:08,570
Oh, wow.

2880
02:58:09,030 --> 02:58:09,110
Shinri.

2881
02:58:09,910 --> 02:58:11,810
Yep, Shinri does that on the daily.

2882
02:58:12,550 --> 02:58:13,110
Shinri.

2883
02:58:14,210 --> 02:58:15,050
Showing up.

2884
02:58:15,690 --> 02:58:16,030
And...

2885
02:58:16,030 --> 02:58:17,610
He'd be on that hip set grind set.

2886
02:58:22,690 --> 02:58:25,410
And finally, are we up to the match?

2887
02:58:25,750 --> 02:58:26,310
Who's going to win?

2888
02:58:26,670 --> 02:58:28,950
Will Shinri be able to snorkel his way to victory?

2889
02:58:30,330 --> 02:58:32,690
Shinri versus Sara!

2890
02:58:34,530 --> 02:58:35,650
Let's go!

2891
02:58:36,190 --> 02:58:38,290
And already up the grapple, the referee!

2892
02:58:38,390 --> 02:58:39,430
What the fuck are you doing, referee?

2893
02:58:39,970 --> 02:58:41,330
Referees just running around.

2894
02:58:41,690 --> 02:58:45,490
And immediately, first one to the ground is Sara.

2895
02:58:46,070 --> 02:58:47,090
Kick into the chest.

2896
02:58:48,290 --> 02:58:49,190
I don't know.

2897
02:58:49,290 --> 02:58:49,610
Kidney.

2898
02:58:51,130 --> 02:58:51,190
Kidney.

2899
02:58:51,290 --> 02:58:51,650
There we go.

2900
02:58:51,770 --> 02:58:52,070
There we go.

2901
02:58:52,150 --> 02:58:54,530
You know, you know stuff about kidneys, right?

2902
02:58:55,430 --> 02:58:56,330
Yeah, I can produce stones.

2903
02:58:56,630 --> 02:58:56,910
Kidney stones.

2904
02:58:57,190 --> 02:58:57,650
Okay, okay.

2905
02:58:57,730 --> 02:58:58,070
That's enough.

2906
02:58:58,130 --> 02:58:58,430
That's enough.

2907
02:58:59,250 --> 02:59:01,630
We're here for Shinri and Sarah.

2908
02:59:02,070 --> 02:59:02,250
Okay.

2909
02:59:02,410 --> 02:59:04,070
We're not here to talk about my medical history.

2910
02:59:04,670 --> 02:59:05,530
Thank you very much.

2911
02:59:05,770 --> 02:59:07,370
Shinri being very aggressive right now.

2912
02:59:08,230 --> 02:59:09,230
Knee to the face!

2913
02:59:11,090 --> 02:59:11,550
Disrespect!

2914
02:59:12,910 --> 02:59:14,590
Three consecutive kicks.

2915
02:59:15,930 --> 02:59:16,030
Ooh.

2916
02:59:16,470 --> 02:59:16,770
Ow.

2917
02:59:17,470 --> 02:59:17,550
Ooh.

2918
02:59:18,290 --> 02:59:18,690
the arm.

2919
02:59:19,430 --> 02:59:19,890
Oh, damn.

2920
02:59:20,850 --> 02:59:22,250
Kind in the streets.

2921
02:59:22,870 --> 02:59:26,890
Shinri is very aggressive with these blows and a knee to the
body as well.

2922
02:59:27,590 --> 02:59:28,010
Oh, we.

2923
02:59:28,610 --> 02:59:28,730
Ah!

2924
02:59:29,010 --> 02:59:29,690
It's a disrespect.

2925
02:59:30,390 --> 02:59:31,470
It just keeps going.

2926
02:59:31,750 --> 02:59:32,330
Helpful for him.

2927
02:59:32,510 --> 02:59:32,950
This is one-sided.

2928
02:59:33,650 --> 02:59:34,750
One-sided matchup.

2929
02:59:34,910 --> 02:59:38,770
And all that gloating a while ago, Sarah, what happened to
the landing part?

2930
02:59:39,050 --> 02:59:39,830
You never landed!

2931
02:59:40,150 --> 02:59:41,390
You're crashing down!

2932
02:59:42,150 --> 02:59:43,810
And oh, ah!

2933
02:59:44,410 --> 02:59:45,730
Oh, not the fingies.

2934
02:59:46,230 --> 02:59:47,870
The fingies and to the back.

2935
02:59:48,290 --> 02:59:49,450
And the back.

2936
02:59:50,790 --> 02:59:53,130
Ooh, those psoas muscles are going to hurt tomorrow.

2937
02:59:53,150 --> 02:59:53,710
Ah, miss!

2938
02:59:53,830 --> 02:59:54,650
Oh, miss the dive.

2939
02:59:55,190 --> 02:59:56,490
Possibly a counter by Sarah.

2940
02:59:57,350 --> 02:59:59,730
Got up, grapple, kick to the stomach.

2941
03:00:00,930 --> 03:00:01,370
A suplex?

2942
03:00:01,950 --> 03:00:02,250
Is that a throw?

2943
03:00:02,770 --> 03:00:03,050
Oh!

2944
03:00:04,310 --> 03:00:06,110
It's a weird suplex thing.

2945
03:00:06,450 --> 03:00:07,170
Another grapple.

2946
03:00:07,710 --> 03:00:09,470
And knee to the face yet again.

2947
03:00:09,770 --> 03:00:10,230
Knee to the face in this face.

2948
03:00:10,390 --> 03:00:11,350
A beautiful face.

2949
03:00:12,030 --> 03:00:14,650
A comeback is probably imminent.

2950
03:00:14,870 --> 03:00:15,750
Oh, submission.

2951
03:00:16,570 --> 03:00:16,690
Oh.

2952
03:00:16,690 --> 03:00:16,990
Oh.

2953
03:00:17,570 --> 03:00:18,090
No!

2954
03:00:18,290 --> 03:00:19,150
It wasn't a submission.

2955
03:00:19,350 --> 03:00:23,310
It was a slam to the arms, aiming for those weak spots.

2956
03:00:23,830 --> 03:00:25,070
Dislocated shoulder for Shinri.

2957
03:00:26,850 --> 03:00:27,650
Oh, what is happening?

2958
03:00:27,750 --> 03:00:28,130
What is happening?

2959
03:00:28,210 --> 03:00:30,830
Oh, I didn't even get to see it, but that's probably
painful.

2960
03:00:31,170 --> 03:00:31,730
Hey, that's foul.

2961
03:00:31,850 --> 03:00:34,070
You know Shinri has aches and his bones and joints.

2962
03:00:34,070 --> 03:00:35,430
Using the corner like that, isn't it?

2963
03:00:35,510 --> 03:00:37,350
Oh, and they didn't even consider the counts.

2964
03:00:38,110 --> 03:00:38,490
Shoulders up.

2965
03:00:38,570 --> 03:00:40,090
Shinri is still pumping up with life.

2966
03:00:42,610 --> 03:00:44,170
And taking off the shoes.

2967
03:00:44,570 --> 03:00:45,770
Sarah, what are you doing?

2968
03:00:46,190 --> 03:00:47,950
Don't take off the shoes, please.

2969
03:00:48,290 --> 03:00:48,710
Stop!

2970
03:00:49,210 --> 03:00:49,450
Stop!

2971
03:00:49,710 --> 03:00:50,690
Stop taking his kicks!

2972
03:00:50,910 --> 03:00:52,850
We know what happens when the shoes come off!

2973
03:00:54,110 --> 03:00:55,050
You see the toes!

2974
03:00:55,790 --> 03:00:56,730
You see the stinky!

2975
03:00:57,290 --> 03:00:57,610
Oh!

2976
03:00:58,670 --> 03:00:58,690
Ow!

2977
03:00:59,730 --> 03:01:00,630
Straight to the turnbuckle.

2978
03:01:02,430 --> 03:01:02,510
Oh!

2979
03:01:02,870 --> 03:01:02,870
Oh!

2980
03:01:03,230 --> 03:01:03,230
Oh!

2981
03:01:03,510 --> 03:01:03,510
Oh!

2982
03:01:04,890 --> 03:01:05,550
Surprisingly athletic!

2983
03:01:05,910 --> 03:01:05,990
No!

2984
03:01:06,010 --> 03:01:07,050
We have Sarah here.

2985
03:01:07,210 --> 03:01:08,750
He can breathe through those feet.

2986
03:01:09,390 --> 03:01:11,490
I didn't think you'd be doing those types of moves.

2987
03:01:12,170 --> 03:01:12,410
Oh!

2988
03:01:13,050 --> 03:01:13,790
Grab them.

2989
03:01:14,290 --> 03:01:15,110
Sarah with the advantage.

2990
03:01:15,530 --> 03:01:16,110
Got a counter.

2991
03:01:16,750 --> 03:01:17,350
Nice reversal.

2992
03:01:17,730 --> 03:01:18,150
It's the torso.

2993
03:01:18,950 --> 03:01:19,830
And miss!

2994
03:01:20,110 --> 03:01:21,230
He missed the clothesline!

2995
03:01:21,390 --> 03:01:22,010
He's blind!

2996
03:01:22,450 --> 03:01:23,450
Shinri, come on!

2997
03:01:23,530 --> 03:01:24,830
And they flew out!

2998
03:01:26,210 --> 03:01:27,010
Okay, follow up.

2999
03:01:27,330 --> 03:01:29,190
You need to remove your snorkeling gear.

3000
03:01:29,310 --> 03:01:29,750
You can't see!

3001
03:01:30,350 --> 03:01:30,870
You can't see.

3002
03:01:30,950 --> 03:01:33,870
I think that's gonna debuff your movement, buddy.

3003
03:01:34,850 --> 03:01:35,130
Ow!

3004
03:01:35,930 --> 03:01:36,270
Ow!

3005
03:01:36,890 --> 03:01:37,990
Face to the mat.

3006
03:01:38,690 --> 03:01:42,210
They really do love fighting outside, don't they, Octavio?

3007
03:01:42,850 --> 03:01:43,430
Yeah, yeah.

3008
03:01:43,450 --> 03:01:45,450
They really like it outside in the air.

3009
03:01:45,450 --> 03:01:47,590
And the fucking taunt is insane!

3010
03:01:48,290 --> 03:01:49,570
in front of the crowd.

3011
03:01:50,350 --> 03:01:51,150
Hyping up the crowd.

3012
03:01:51,310 --> 03:01:52,630
I don't know if they're booing or not.

3013
03:01:52,630 --> 03:01:53,830
Oh, CBR.

3014
03:01:54,250 --> 03:01:55,150
So fucking sinister.

3015
03:01:55,650 --> 03:01:57,590
Going on two inches deep.

3016
03:02:01,020 --> 03:02:02,100
Bro, hitting the center.

3017
03:02:02,300 --> 03:02:02,940
Okay, we go back to the ring.

3018
03:02:03,520 --> 03:02:05,040
This is actually a very driven fight.

3019
03:02:05,280 --> 03:02:06,100
I'm not sure who will win.

3020
03:02:07,020 --> 03:02:07,660
Yeah, me too.

3021
03:02:07,780 --> 03:02:08,240
I don't know.

3022
03:02:08,500 --> 03:02:10,220
They're like doing a back and forth here.

3023
03:02:10,720 --> 03:02:16,560
I think that's going to be a common theme from now on,
considering probably the best fighters are going to be at

3024
03:02:16,560 --> 03:02:18,080
the last segment of the show.

3025
03:02:18,780 --> 03:02:19,580
Oh, oh, maybe.

3026
03:02:20,140 --> 03:02:31,140
you think oh ow we they really do like fighting in the
corners oh what is that to the fucking ground strength to do

3027
03:02:31,140 --> 03:02:38,320

of drowning I'm expecting finishers here because they've

3036
03:04:05,020 --> 03:04:13,620
been dishing out like a lot of hits oh they've probably been
charged up like a long time ago trying to escape through the

03:05:19,540 --> 03:05:20,580
Arthritis tomorrow.

3047
03:05:20,880 --> 03:05:21,120
This is it.

3048
03:05:21,160 --> 03:05:21,520
This is it.

3049
03:05:21,720 --> 03:05:22,540
I think this is the finisher.

3050
03:05:23,120 --> 03:05:23,600
Oh, pin.

3051
03:05:23,900 --> 03:05:24,740
I think this is the pin.

3052
03:05:25,620 --> 03:05:25,880
Oh, no.

3053
03:05:25,920 --> 03:05:26,440
What are you doing?

3054
03:05:26,680 --> 03:05:27,660
Sarah, what the fuck are you doing?

3055
03:05:27,900 --> 03:05:28,260
Pin it down.

3056
03:05:28,840 --> 03:05:29,020
No, wait.

3057
03:05:29,320 --> 03:05:29,860
That's my senpai.

3058
03:05:30,040 --> 03:05:30,600
No, don't pin him down.

3059
03:05:31,120 --> 03:05:31,740
Oh, there's blood.

3060
03:05:32,160 --> 03:05:34,120
Oh, Shinri's bloodied.

3061
03:05:34,740 --> 03:05:35,140
Oh.

3062
03:05:35,260 --> 03:05:36,600
The beautiful face.

3063
03:05:36,900 --> 03:05:38,100
Now this can populate.

3064
03:05:38,660 --> 03:05:41,140
Oh, no, Shinri, this is all your fault.

3065
03:05:41,260 --> 03:05:41,800
You're going to lose.

3066
03:05:42,060 --> 03:05:42,300
Two.

3067
03:05:42,960 --> 03:05:43,640
Oh, kick down.

3068
03:05:43,740 --> 03:05:44,700
How did you survive?

3069
03:05:45,340 --> 03:05:46,980
still has a fighting chance.

3070
03:05:47,420 --> 03:05:50,460
After all that, Shinri is still fighting back.

3071
03:05:51,500 --> 03:05:52,880
He's resilient like a Koi.

3072
03:05:54,240 --> 03:05:56,280
Like a Koi coming upstream.

3073
03:05:58,620 --> 03:05:59,200
Oh, ah!

3074
03:06:00,540 --> 03:06:02,060
Ooh, I think that's it.

3075
03:06:02,680 --> 03:06:03,580
I think Shinri like that.

3076
03:06:03,880 --> 03:06:04,360
The pin is here.

3077
03:06:04,960 --> 03:06:06,300
Oh, wait, oh wait, reversal!

3078
03:06:07,100 --> 03:06:07,700
Kicked in the butt.

3079
03:06:08,680 --> 03:06:09,900
Reversal after reversal.

3080
03:06:10,600 --> 03:06:11,560

Don't do that.

3093
03:06:56,140 --> 03:06:57,580

3223
03:16:00,700 --> 03:16:09,300
Killian Murphy from another one of that break dancing show
that was presented earlier my goodness they're still

3224
03:16:09,300 --> 03:16:16,700
catching up but yeah I'm hoping for the best for Hakka
considering that he is part of our Hall of Stars branch.

3225
03:16:17,000 --> 03:16:18,180
So I hope you win.

3226
03:16:18,380 --> 03:16:20,120
No bias, but I hope you win.

3227
03:16:20,500 --> 03:16:21,000
Good luck, Haka.

3228
03:16:21,480 --> 03:16:22,100
Good luck.

3229
03:16:22,720 --> 03:16:23,700
I'm rooting for you.

3230
03:16:23,840 --> 03:16:25,380
We'll see how Haka cheats this time.

3231
03:16:26,460 --> 03:16:30,600
Or will Philean actually turn to tables and actually win
this match?

3232
03:16:30,600 --> 03:16:31,540
I feel like Philean will win.

3233
03:16:32,400 --> 03:16:32,780
Oh, yeah.

3234
03:16:32,900 --> 03:16:33,180
Let's see.

3235
03:16:33,220 --> 03:16:33,540
Let's see.

3236
03:16:34,640 --> 03:16:34,840
Yeah.

3237
03:16:35,120 --> 03:16:36,340
Subversion of expectations.

3238
03:16:37,340 --> 03:16:41,260
Those dance moves make Kerr like a really competitive
fighter.

3239
03:16:42,280 --> 03:16:43,700
Like she can get out of pins.

3240
03:16:43,840 --> 03:16:51,200
can jump she can high fly yeah like the previous match that
we watched with her was like nothing but high flying i

3241
03:16:51,200 --> 03:17:02,600
wonder what this match is going to turn out into like a
heavy fighter like a heavy swagger or a lightweighter okay

3242
03:17:02,600 --> 03:17:17,240
here we go all right all right we shall see haka versus fion
fight oh wow oh did it Immediately right off the bat.

3243
03:17:17,320 --> 03:17:19,160
What happened to the cock, cock, cock.

3244
03:17:19,540 --> 03:17:20,880
All I'm seeing is cock, cock, cock.

3245
03:17:20,880 --> 03:17:23,200
One of these big throws, high flyer attacks.

3246
03:17:23,660 --> 03:17:24,200
Holy crap.

3247
03:17:24,880 --> 03:17:25,920
What are you doing?

3248
03:17:26,360 --> 03:17:28,080
Haka, you're failing immediately.

3249
03:17:29,540 --> 03:17:30,200
To the face.

3250
03:17:30,400 --> 03:17:33,740
Oh my god, already smudging the face into the fucking ring.

3251
03:17:34,100 --> 03:17:35,160
It's so over.

3252
03:17:36,320 --> 03:17:40,520
But we just started, so let us see if this narrative
continues on down the road.

3253
03:17:40,820 --> 03:17:41,320
And it hurts.

3254
03:17:41,600 --> 03:17:43,340
Those tendons and ligaments are getting torn.

3255
03:17:44,360 --> 03:17:46,040
By Philly and the Killian.

3256
03:17:47,880 --> 03:17:48,820
Okay, that hurts.

3257
03:17:49,160 --> 03:17:50,600
Oh, another one to the face.

3258
03:17:51,280 --> 03:17:52,720
Haka barely even fighting back.

3259
03:17:53,080 --> 03:17:54,280
Twisting your arm.

3260
03:17:54,580 --> 03:17:55,600
Are you okay, Haka?

3261
03:17:55,800 --> 03:17:57,460
Oh, break those fingers again.

3262
03:17:58,240 --> 03:17:59,600
Oh, my God.

3263
03:18:00,660 --> 03:18:01,720
Oh, my God.

3264
03:18:01,860 --> 03:18:05,000
I guess this is what you call like an animal fight.

3265
03:18:05,780 --> 03:18:06,000
Like, ah.

3266
03:18:06,300 --> 03:18:07,040
Can you reverse it?

3267
03:18:07,400 --> 03:18:08,380
No, he's going to do it again.

3268
03:18:09,460 --> 03:18:10,120
I ran out of words.

3269
03:18:10,720 --> 03:18:11,100
Oh, shit.

3270
03:18:11,340 --> 03:18:11,720
Three.

3271
03:18:12,020 --> 03:18:12,760
Again, again.

3272
03:18:13,340 --> 03:18:23,560
raffles of the same kind why are you still targeting haka's
fingies oh we oh we it's over haka won't be able to use a

3273
03:18:23,560 --> 03:18:35,100
spoon and fork again after this fight the reversal like six
is very high oh wow okay finally a comeback the elbow to the

3274
03:18:35,100 --> 03:18:38,140
face sizing each other up and phillian again

3275
03:18:43,340 --> 03:18:44,300
Never getting back up.

3276
03:18:44,300 --> 03:18:44,700
It's going to hurt.

3277
03:18:45,040 --> 03:18:46,560
Another somersault technique.

3278
03:18:47,480 --> 03:18:48,040
Buns.

3279
03:18:48,340 --> 03:18:48,520
Oh, wait.

3280
03:18:48,860 --> 03:18:49,140
Oh, wait.

3281
03:18:49,140 --> 03:18:49,540
A pin already.

3282
03:18:49,700 --> 03:18:50,100
Oh, wait.

3283
03:18:50,300 --> 03:18:50,480
A pin.

3284
03:18:50,860 --> 03:18:51,140
Opportunity.

3285
03:18:52,480 --> 03:18:53,960
That could have turned the table.

3286
03:18:54,840 --> 03:18:57,700
But no, it's still early and barely any damage has been
done.

3287
03:18:58,300 --> 03:18:59,880
It would be a miracle to perform.

3288
03:19:00,420 --> 03:19:01,480
Billion just keeps tumbling and rumbling.

3289
03:19:02,700 --> 03:19:03,840
And going around.

3290
03:19:03,860 --> 03:19:04,220
Rumbling.

3291
03:19:05,460 --> 03:19:05,840
Rumbling.

3292
03:19:07,760 --> 03:19:08,320
Oh.

3293
03:19:09,340 --> 03:19:09,900
Oh.

3294
03:19:09,900 --> 03:19:10,040
Oh.

3295
03:19:10,040 --> 03:19:11,020
This might be hot.

3296
03:19:11,020 --> 03:19:12,200
It's time to come back.

3297
03:19:12,300 --> 03:19:12,800
Do a comeback.

3298
03:19:13,280 --> 03:19:13,320
Oh.

3299
03:19:13,340 --> 03:19:24,060
on the turnbuckle salvo punches this corner may be his only
chance of winning it back and no he got punched into the gut

3300
03:19:24,060 --> 03:19:38,300
and oh he got caught and an elbow to the chest straight to
the heart oh really focusing on the arms there I'm sorry

3301
03:19:38,300 --> 03:19:45,580
Hakka it's over I think this is probably impossible for you
to come back to unless unless you pull something through

3302
03:19:45,580 --> 03:20:02,520
okay is this a glimmer of hope a glimmer of hope is this a
light here at a very dark tunnel oh oh wait oh oh god back

3303
03:20:02,520 --> 03:20:10,240
up oh well instead of recovering from philian didn't even
feel that oh oh we okay here's a pin here's a pin

3304
03:20:13,340 --> 03:20:14,120
A kick out.

3305
03:20:14,520 --> 03:20:15,200
Kick out of the pin.

3306
03:20:15,720 --> 03:20:17,660
And surprisingly, it didn't have a count.

3307
03:20:19,440 --> 03:20:20,580
Surprisingly resilient of Haka.

3308
03:20:23,320 --> 03:20:23,540
Oh.

3309
03:20:24,440 --> 03:20:25,840
Billion throwing him.

3310
03:20:25,920 --> 03:20:27,240
Haka throwing back.

3311
03:20:27,600 --> 03:20:28,160
Somersaulting.

3312
03:20:28,160 --> 03:20:28,940
What is going on in Haka?

3313
03:20:29,400 --> 03:20:30,140
Are you okay?

3314
03:20:30,380 --> 03:20:31,280
Oh, moon kick.

3315
03:20:31,580 --> 03:20:32,140
Oh.

3316
03:20:34,360 --> 03:20:35,600
Haka was funny there.

3317
03:20:35,700 --> 03:20:36,440
It was like, right.

3318
03:20:40,960 --> 03:20:42,820
Oh, this might be it.

3319
03:20:43,340 --> 03:20:44,160
Yeah, this is it.

3320
03:20:44,360 --> 03:20:45,900
That wasn't even a match.

3321
03:20:46,120 --> 03:20:47,680
That was like a fucking massacre.

3322
03:20:48,360 --> 03:20:48,380
Oh!

3323
03:20:48,720 --> 03:20:49,520
Still going!

3324
03:20:49,960 --> 03:20:50,240
So slow!

3325
03:20:50,780 --> 03:20:51,140
What?

3326
03:20:52,040 --> 03:20:53,140
Somebody fire the referee!

3327
03:20:54,020 --> 03:20:54,400
Haka!

3328
03:20:54,660 --> 03:20:57,080
I gotta admit, you're pretty fucking strong here.

3329
03:20:57,480 --> 03:21:01,100
Like your durability on your character is just super fucking
weird.

3330
03:21:01,640 --> 03:21:03,000
What is your statistics, man?

3331
03:21:03,800 --> 03:21:04,360
And jump in!

3332
03:21:04,500 --> 03:21:04,860
It's a flip-flops.

3333
03:21:06,180 --> 03:21:07,300
It's a flip-flops.

3334
03:21:08,060 --> 03:21:09,300
Oh, countered.

3335
03:21:09,300 --> 03:21:09,880
Oh!

3336
03:21:10,600 --> 03:21:13,320
That flip only caused you a lot.

3337
03:21:13,340 --> 03:21:14,620
like a damage to the chest.

3338
03:21:14,760 --> 03:21:16,100
Because his toes are free.

3339
03:21:16,980 --> 03:21:17,460
Oh!

3340
03:21:18,540 --> 03:21:19,900
Stun meter going up!

3341
03:21:20,740 --> 03:21:22,260
Now get her into the ring and pin her down!

3342
03:21:22,280 --> 03:21:23,240
Is he going to get the momentum ready?

3343
03:21:23,620 --> 03:21:24,880
Three seconds outside!

3344
03:21:25,180 --> 03:21:27,320
Oh, taunting?

3345
03:21:27,640 --> 03:21:27,700
Taunting?

3346
03:21:28,260 --> 03:21:28,500
Oh!

3347
03:21:30,020 --> 03:21:31,220
Right in front of the top!

3348
03:21:31,920 --> 03:21:33,100
That disrespect is real!

3349
03:21:33,340 --> 03:21:33,960
Oh my god!

3350
03:21:34,180 --> 03:21:34,820
Leverage pin!

3351
03:21:34,840 --> 03:21:36,020
Reverse pin!

3352
03:21:38,480 --> 03:21:40,180
These pins are very short.

3353
03:21:41,320 --> 03:21:42,320
Not even a one count.

3354
03:21:43,500 --> 03:21:45,500
Ooh, ah, reversal.

3355
03:21:45,900 --> 03:21:47,740
Reverse elbow to the face yet again.

3356
03:21:47,940 --> 03:21:48,360
Eh.

3357
03:21:49,040 --> 03:21:49,620
Back shot.

3358
03:21:53,960 --> 03:21:55,000
Stop it.

3359
03:21:55,960 --> 03:21:56,020
Oh!

3360
03:21:57,580 --> 03:21:59,440
We're having corner attacks here.

3361
03:21:59,660 --> 03:22:00,000
One more?

3362
03:22:00,280 --> 03:22:01,000
Turnbuckle attacks.

3363
03:22:01,420 --> 03:22:02,120
Oh, there's one more.

3364
03:22:02,240 --> 03:22:02,820
One more?

3365
03:22:03,420 --> 03:22:04,960
Announcing another finishing strike.

3366
03:22:05,720 --> 03:22:06,500
And here it is.

3367
03:22:06,580 --> 03:22:08,220
Pin, down for the count.

3368
03:22:08,720 --> 03:22:09,640
Is it really down for the count?

3369
03:22:09,640 --> 03:22:10,000
This is it.

3370
03:22:10,160 --> 03:22:10,780
This might be it.

3371
03:22:10,780 --> 03:22:12,880
One, two, three!

3372
03:22:13,340 --> 03:22:27,540
billion one wow that was a one-sided match here is your

illegal move i mean that's not the only illegal thing that's

actual fight it seems like i was a little bit um like not

3380

Damn.

3392
03:24:49,600 --> 03:24:51,320
That was a little bit personal.

3393
03:24:51,900 --> 03:24:52,980
I walked myself to the hospital.

3394
03:24:53,280 --> 03:24:53,980
That was awkward.

3395
03:24:54,480 --> 03:24:55,320
Thank you for having me.

3396
03:24:55,460 --> 03:24:56,520
I walked myself to the hospital.

3397
03:24:57,560 --> 03:24:59,180
It's way too close to home.

3398
03:24:59,880 --> 03:25:01,160
This dog has taken hands.

3399
03:25:01,300 --> 03:25:02,040
Let me tell you that.

3400
03:25:04,420 --> 03:25:05,540
Well, the fight was amazing.

3401
03:25:05,760 --> 03:25:07,820
I think the Leon's moves are really, really cool.

3402
03:25:08,000 --> 03:25:09,780
And I can't wait to see how far.

3403
03:25:10,000 --> 03:25:12,660
I think I think he'll get pretty far Philly in.

3404
03:25:13,520 --> 03:25:14,800
Yeah, I could tell too.

3405
03:25:15,080 --> 03:25:16,160
High flyer and heavy hitter.

3406
03:25:16,300 --> 03:25:18,540
Damn, the combination of the statistics is fucking good.

3407
03:25:18,840 --> 03:25:20,600
Like you don't even give Hawkeye a chance.

3408
03:25:21,060 --> 03:25:21,760
Impressed as hell.

3409
03:25:22,140 --> 03:25:25,300
It's a really, really like exhausting fucking sport.

3410
03:25:25,600 --> 03:25:26,880
So you're doing you're doing your best.

Who's the next one?

3418
03:25:42,280 --> 03:25:43,860
Who's ready to battle?

3419
03:25:45,440 --> 03:25:46,660
Who's next in the...

3420
03:25:46,660 --> 03:25:47,560
Oh, wait, oh, wait, wait.

3421
03:25:47,760 --> 03:25:48,460
Phelian, right?

3422
03:25:48,540 --> 03:25:50,000
Like, she's going to go casting?

3423
03:25:50,040 --> 03:25:51,020
Wait, is it my fight?

3424
03:25:51,660 --> 03:25:51,900
Yeah.

3425
03:25:52,340 --> 03:25:53,480
I think it is.

3426
03:25:53,700 --> 03:25:53,940
Yeah.

3427
03:25:54,540 --> 03:25:55,080
We're just...

3428
03:25:55,080 --> 03:25:56,200
It's my fight.

3429
03:25:56,620 --> 03:25:58,120
Oh, you're casting your own fight.

3430
03:25:58,580 --> 03:25:59,200
Let's fucking go!

3431
03:26:00,620 --> 03:26:01,760
We're just waiting for your opponent.

3432
03:26:01,760 --> 03:26:02,980
Am I going to cast my own fight?

3433
03:26:03,780 --> 03:26:04,360
I think.

3434
03:26:04,560 --> 03:26:05,620
I think so.

3435
03:26:06,320 --> 03:26:08,940
Well, now that you're here, let's see.

3436
03:26:09,480 --> 03:26:09,840
I want...

3437
03:26:09,840 --> 03:26:11,360
I want to see your match, Octavio.

3438
03:26:11,680 --> 03:26:12,380
I want to see it.

3439
03:26:12,800 --> 03:26:15,100
Like, I want to see your live reactions to everything.

3440
03:26:16,640 --> 03:26:18,360
Like, how are you going to face against a dragon?

3441
03:26:20,400 --> 03:26:22,780
I mean, dragon's kind of like a dinosaur.

3442
03:26:23,640 --> 03:26:24,240
So kind of easy to...

3443
03:26:24,240 --> 03:26:25,160
So can you take him on?

3444
03:26:25,460 --> 03:26:26,600
You guys do look like siblings.

3445
03:26:27,160 --> 03:26:28,420
I can just cut off their tails.

3446
03:26:29,180 --> 03:26:29,760
Their wings.

3447
03:26:30,780 --> 03:26:32,680
But no, the difference was I fucking lost.

3448
03:26:33,160 --> 03:26:34,520
So I don't think that's a parable.

3449
03:26:36,300 --> 03:26:36,900
What's up?

3450
03:26:37,240 --> 03:26:38,260

3454
03:27:09,880 --> 03:27:11,740
You're a dragon.

3455
03:27:12,220 --> 03:27:13,800
You know, you're more like a baby worm.

3456
03:27:14,100 --> 03:27:15,300
You're actually more like a worm.

3457
03:27:15,460 --> 03:27:17,940
I'm going to crush you beneath my heel of my boot.

3458
03:27:17,980 --> 03:27:19,400
Ah, don't talk back, please.

3459
03:27:20,020 --> 03:27:21,260
So you're going to...

3460
03:27:21,260 --> 03:27:22,520
That was pretty good.

3461
03:27:23,400 --> 03:27:23,800
Really?

3462
03:27:25,660 --> 03:27:27,300

3467
03:27:29,440 --> 03:27:30,020
I'm not accepting anything.

3468
03:27:30,160 --> 03:27:30,420
I don't know.

3469
03:27:30,540 --> 03:27:30,720
I don't know.

3470
03:27:30,720 --> 03:27:31,100
Just accept it.

3471
03:27:31,540 --> 03:27:32,120
No, man.

3472
03:27:34,080 --> 03:27:34,480
Yay!

3473
03:27:35,460 --> 03:27:36,000
I win.

3474
03:27:36,740 --> 03:27:39,260
I don't have anything to say to you.

3475
03:27:39,320 --> 03:27:39,700
I don't know.

3476
03:27:39,840 --> 03:27:41,920
Oh, you're worthless!

3477
03:27:43,320 --> 03:27:43,680
I'll take it!

3478
03:27:43,960 --> 03:27:44,960
She literally called you!

3479
03:27:45,440 --> 03:27:47,780
Worthless, not even worth the attention, bro!

3480
03:27:48,060 --> 03:27:48,660
Are you gonna accept that?

3481
03:27:48,660 --> 03:27:49,520
Not even worth the reply?

3482
03:27:50,080 --> 03:27:51,040
How dare you!

3483
03:27:51,420 --> 03:27:52,040
Bro, bro!

3484
03:27:52,040 --> 03:27:52,840
I'm gonna burn!

3485
03:27:53,140 --> 03:27:55,040
That fucking disrespect is insane.

3486
03:27:55,380 --> 03:27:56,840
I don't think I'm right now.

3487
03:27:57,060 --> 03:27:58,600
Bro, literally said hello to me.

3488
03:27:59,380 --> 03:28:00,520
Oh, uh...

3489
03:28:00,520 --> 03:28:02,200
Stop doing this, tell me!

3490
03:28:03,260 --> 03:28:04,740
Come here, my arguments!

3491
03:28:07,500 --> 03:28:09,780
The first thing you did was like stutter to me.

3492
03:28:09,840 --> 03:28:13,620
Like you saw me draw and you're like, oh, oh, holy crap.

3493
03:28:14,580 --> 03:28:15,180
What do I do?

3494
03:28:15,420 --> 03:28:16,420
I can't believe this.

3495
03:28:16,860 --> 03:28:17,600
I can't believe this.

3496
03:28:17,600 --> 03:28:18,720
You are an embarrassment, bro.

3497
03:28:19,020 --> 03:28:20,640
Come on, not like this.

3498
03:28:20,920 --> 03:28:21,560
Not like this.

3499

3555
03:30:58,360 --> 03:30:58,560
See?

3556
03:30:58,760 --> 03:30:59,240
Oh, wow.

3557
03:30:59,320 --> 03:31:00,920
A lot of budget went to the outfit.

3558
03:31:01,060 --> 03:31:02,020
Wow, wow, wow.

3559
03:31:04,400 --> 03:31:05,760
I think this guy is going to win.

3560
03:31:08,140 --> 03:31:09,180
Just my feeling.

3561
03:31:09,840 --> 03:31:11,560
Let's see what Sia looks like.

3562
03:31:12,720 --> 03:31:16,760
Let's see, because sometimes the build determines the match.

3563
03:31:18,060 --> 03:31:18,780
He's going crazy.

3564
03:31:20,120 --> 03:31:21,140
You're still going.

3565
03:31:23,780 --> 03:31:24,860
I don't know, man.

3566
03:31:24,980 --> 03:31:26,320
Look at all my strings, see?

3567
03:31:26,440 --> 03:31:27,600
I'm going to attach those to Sia.

3568
03:31:28,760 --> 03:31:32,000
I'm going to win without even touching her, without even
punching her.

3569
03:31:32,820 --> 03:31:32,920
Mm-hmm.

3570
03:31:33,700 --> 03:31:36,520
Oh, oh, bro, I don't want to look at the polls right now.

3571
03:31:36,600 --> 03:31:38,200
I think you're in a fucking, oh no.

3572
03:31:39,840 --> 03:31:43,140
getting bodied, everyone, everyone has zero faith in you.

3573
03:31:43,400 --> 03:31:44,880
Introducing his opponent.

3574
03:31:45,420 --> 03:31:46,860
The WWE Universe.

3575
03:31:47,320 --> 03:31:47,800
Whoa.

3576
03:31:48,720 --> 03:31:49,660
From hell.

3577
03:31:52,320 --> 03:31:52,960
Bruh.

3578
03:31:53,540 --> 03:31:58,080
She is the Slayer Seah!

3579
03:32:04,070 --> 03:32:05,210
Holy crap.

3580
03:32:05,670 --> 03:32:07,330
Wow, you brought in a torch.

3581
03:32:07,830 --> 03:32:08,870
What do you mean from hell?

3582
03:32:09,190 --> 03:32:10,450
She's from a little cave.

3583
03:32:11,210 --> 03:32:12,750
Oh my god!

3584
03:32:13,090 --> 03:32:15,730
Bro, stop burning the stage!

3585
03:32:16,470 --> 03:32:18,010
Shout out to the mom out here!

3586
03:32:20,170 --> 03:32:23,210
Your daughter's lighting up the fucking stage.

3587
03:32:27,450 --> 03:32:29,330
Dude, does your mom know you're V-tubing?

3588
03:32:29,490 --> 03:32:30,130
The arena is burning.

3589
03:32:31,130 --> 03:32:32,230
Does your mom know you're V-tubing?

3590
03:32:33,710 --> 03:32:34,190
Yes.

3591
03:32:35,050 --> 03:32:35,930
Mine doesn't.

3592
03:32:36,250 --> 03:32:36,590
No.

3593
03:32:37,070 --> 03:32:39,410
Imagine if she actually stumbles onto this WWE stream.

3594
03:32:39,430 --> 03:32:40,570
Are you ashamed of yourself?

3595
03:32:41,210 --> 03:32:42,390
Of course I am.

3596
03:32:44,630 --> 03:32:45,590
Mom, it's not what you think.

3597
03:32:45,590 --> 03:32:45,950
Excuse me.

3598
03:32:46,050 --> 03:32:46,890
It's not what you think.

3599
03:32:46,890 --> 03:32:47,850
VTubers are the cool kids.

3600
03:32:49,950 --> 03:32:51,750
Oh, I'm doing voice acting, mom.

3601
03:32:52,030 --> 03:32:52,370
I swear.

3602
03:32:53,330 --> 03:32:54,790
VTubers are the new jocks.

3603
03:32:56,110 --> 03:32:57,570
I make money, mom.

3604
03:32:58,610 --> 03:32:59,690
Not a phase, I swear.

3605
03:33:03,330 --> 03:33:04,130
Entering the ring.

3606
03:33:04,810 --> 03:33:06,890
And no pyrotechnics.

3607
03:33:06,990 --> 03:33:08,710
I guess she loses in terms of like...

3608
03:33:08,710 --> 03:33:09,450
She's big and bulky again.

3609
03:33:09,510 --> 03:33:09,850
Look at that.

3610
03:33:09,950 --> 03:33:11,090
She's going to be tall, I swear to God.

3611
03:33:11,210 --> 03:33:12,650
It's gonna be seven feet tall.

3612
03:33:13,510 --> 03:33:14,550
Is she gonna be?

3613
03:33:14,750 --> 03:33:16,370
And I'm just gonna be five, five, eight.

3614
03:33:18,950 --> 03:33:19,870
Here we go.

3615
03:33:20,990 --> 03:33:21,510
Oh, wow.

3616
03:33:21,810 --> 03:33:22,390
Oh, wow.

3617
03:33:23,150 --> 03:33:23,850
Oh, wow.

3618
03:33:24,950 --> 03:33:26,370
They're both doing the same thing.

3619
03:33:27,210 --> 03:33:29,090
But the only winner is one.

3620
03:33:29,330 --> 03:33:30,090
Who are they gonna be?

3621
03:33:30,310 --> 03:33:30,670
Oh, kick.

3622
03:33:30,830 --> 03:33:32,110
Oh, my God.

3623
03:33:32,370 --> 03:33:33,250
It made it start.

3624
03:33:33,570 --> 03:33:34,730
And they're having a cat fight.

3625
03:33:34,910 --> 03:33:35,990
Oh, ripping off the hair.

3626
03:33:36,230 --> 03:33:36,890
Oh, not the hair.

3627
03:33:37,190 --> 03:33:37,850
Ripping off the arms.

3628
03:33:39,030 --> 03:33:40,030
Clipping the arms.

3629
03:33:41,210 --> 03:33:55,050
wings of an angel reversal grapple and oh oh my god octavia
you might actually fucking win oh my god oh my god dude's

3630
03:33:55,050 --> 03:34:05,170

butt dive oh oh twist in the neck yeah dislocate that head
Here it is.

3632
03:34:12,210 --> 03:34:12,610
Is it a tap out?

3633
03:34:12,910 --> 03:34:13,470
Remove that dragon's head.

3634
03:34:14,130 --> 03:34:14,710
Oh, no.

3635
03:34:15,030 --> 03:34:15,870
It wasn't a tap out.

3636
03:34:16,090 --> 03:34:16,370
There we go.

3637
03:34:16,610 --> 03:34:17,170
It wasn't a submission move.

3638
03:34:17,470 --> 03:34:17,570
Yes.

3639
03:34:18,050 --> 03:34:19,350
Oh, Stunner.

3640
03:34:21,070 --> 03:34:22,230
Oh, is this a finisher?

3641
03:34:23,110 --> 03:34:23,730
Is this a finisher?

3642
03:34:25,050 --> 03:34:25,310
Oh, no.

3643
03:34:25,430 --> 03:34:26,310
It's just a taunt.

3644
03:34:27,490 --> 03:34:31,170
Octavio with the aggressive play here bashing in.

3645
03:34:31,550 --> 03:34:32,090
Oh, my God.

3646
03:34:32,170 --> 03:34:33,230
Here's a pin already.

3647
03:34:34,690 --> 03:34:36,410
One and a kick out.

3648
03:34:37,370 --> 03:34:44,710
Sia, if you ever want to win, you better fight back because
Octavio's on a fucking roll here and a smash on those arms

3649
03:34:44,710 --> 03:35:01,990
let's go oh oh oh we went do i still not deserve a request

3650
03:35:01,990 --> 03:35:12,710

this to me and a barely a scratch to Octavio.

3651
03:35:13,970 --> 03:35:17,130
You're going to have to do more than that to actually do
some more.

3652
03:35:18,750 --> 03:35:19,690
Went past by GamerSuffs.

3653
03:35:19,710 --> 03:35:21,150
Offered by GamerSuffs,

3654
03:35:24,350 --> 03:35:24,630
Aggression.

3655
03:35:25,010 --> 03:35:27,690
Athleticism is being shown to the screen.

3656
03:35:28,390 --> 03:35:30,410
They're both still fighting outside.

3657
03:35:31,570 --> 03:35:31,910
Ooh!

3658
03:35:33,130 --> 03:35:35,490
Pull those strings, puppet man.

3659
03:35:36,890 --> 03:35:38,750
Nothing but dirty plays.

3660
03:35:39,650 --> 03:35:39,830
And...

3661
03:35:39,830 --> 03:35:41,190
Nothing but dirty plays.

3662
03:35:41,210 --> 03:35:41,630
It is dirty play.

3663
03:35:41,630 --> 03:35:42,190
This is all legit.

3664
03:35:44,090 --> 03:35:45,090
It is dirty play.

3665
03:35:45,510 --> 03:35:47,630
You're not fighting into the stage.

3666
03:35:48,790 --> 03:35:50,030
No, that's not allowed.

3667
03:35:50,550 --> 03:35:51,630
Oh, they're back in.

3668
03:35:51,830 --> 03:35:53,050
Okay, they're back in.

3669
03:35:53,270 --> 03:35:54,410
Oh, Octavio, what are you doing?

3670
03:35:54,930 --> 03:35:59,370
Octavio, you arrogant prick, get inside a ring.

3671
03:36:01,510 --> 03:36:02,250
Pin him.

3672
03:36:02,290 --> 03:36:03,150
Pin him down.

3673
03:36:03,850 --> 03:36:04,110
Oh!

3674
03:36:04,450 --> 03:36:04,930
Damn!

3675
03:36:05,610 --> 03:36:05,850
Oh!

3676
03:36:06,210 --> 03:36:06,790
Is this it?

3677
03:36:07,670 --> 03:36:08,950
Oh, high flyer technique!

3678
03:36:09,070 --> 03:36:09,750
Oh, he's gonna dive.

3679
03:36:11,850 --> 03:36:13,130
Oh shit!

3680
03:36:13,790 --> 03:36:15,290
It's over, it's so over.

3681
03:36:16,170 --> 03:36:17,910
And a pain, one, two!

3682
03:36:18,370 --> 03:36:20,450
Oh, kicked out!

3683
03:36:21,070 --> 03:36:23,610
There may be hope here for Sia fans out here.

3684
03:36:24,430 --> 03:36:26,910
And doing a taunt of all things!

3685
03:36:29,030 --> 03:36:31,250
The absolute confidence is in this motherfucker.

3686
03:36:31,670 --> 03:36:34,330
Stay in your, stay in your fictionary books.

3687
03:36:34,750 --> 03:36:35,430
Fictional books.

3688
03:36:36,670 --> 03:36:37,310
Where you belong.

3689
03:36:38,030 --> 03:36:39,910
Throw in the corner and another punch.

3690
03:36:41,210 --> 03:36:54,010
nothing oh no I feel so sorry for Sia right now oh wait come
back come back oh no is it is it oh my head we got a grapple

3691
03:36:54,010 --> 03:37:03,470
technique here but not enough to actually put him in a
stunning stage so far we've seen Octavio body Sia what's

3692
03:37:03,470 --> 03:37:12,270
happening I don't know they're just going in and out in and
out what's going on But it's something.

3693
03:37:12,870 --> 03:37:13,210
Oh, no!

3694
03:37:16,610 --> 03:37:17,810
Don't put me on the...

3695
03:37:17,810 --> 03:37:19,610
And head to the turnbuckle.

3696
03:37:20,390 --> 03:37:21,090
Oh, damn.

3697
03:37:21,330 --> 03:37:22,230
What are you doing, Sia?

3698
03:37:22,870 --> 03:37:23,730
What are you doing?

3699
03:37:24,190 --> 03:37:25,070
Sia, what are you doing?

3700
03:37:25,370 --> 03:37:26,330
Sia, I think you're...

3701
03:37:26,330 --> 03:37:27,130
Oh, my God.

3702
03:37:27,430 --> 03:37:28,170
What the hell?

3703
03:37:29,230 --> 03:37:29,710
Is this it?

3704
03:37:29,710 --> 03:37:30,170
Is this it?

3705
03:37:31,110 --> 03:37:31,590
Oh, no!

3706
03:37:32,590 --> 03:37:33,070
No!

3707
03:37:34,590 --> 03:37:35,550
Oh, shit!

3708
03:37:35,970 --> 03:37:37,190
Oh, I'm stunned.

3709
03:37:37,990 --> 03:37:38,810
Is this it?

3710
03:37:38,930 --> 03:37:39,690
One trick pony!

3711
03:37:40,170 --> 03:37:40,590
One!

3712
03:37:41,410 --> 03:37:41,810
Oh!

3713
03:37:42,630 --> 03:37:43,270
Just a one count.

3714
03:37:43,710 --> 03:37:44,590
Good job, good job.

3715
03:37:46,990 --> 03:37:48,170
Okay, what are you doing?

3716
03:37:49,130 --> 03:37:50,750
Not even worth a second count.

3717
03:37:51,450 --> 03:37:52,470
Position her correctly.

3718
03:37:53,930 --> 03:37:54,450
Oh no.

3719
03:37:54,650 --> 03:37:56,190
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, reversal!

3720
03:37:57,790 --> 03:37:58,190
Ayo!

3721
03:38:01,230 --> 03:38:01,630
Octavio!

3722
03:38:03,210 --> 03:38:03,610
Damn.

3723
03:38:06,950 --> 03:38:08,090
Okay, more of this?

3724
03:38:08,150 --> 03:38:10,190
Oh, wow, the ref is in the fucking way.

3725
03:38:10,270 --> 03:38:11,190
Yeah, the ref was in the way.

3726
03:38:11,210 --> 03:38:13,030
Get out of the way!

3727
03:38:14,210 --> 03:38:14,750
Submission!

3728
03:38:15,110 --> 03:38:15,570
Submission!

3729
03:38:16,170 --> 03:38:16,590
Is this it?

3730
03:38:17,170 --> 03:38:17,190
Oh!

3731
03:38:18,210 --> 03:38:19,310
No, no, it wasn't a tap out.

3732
03:38:20,130 --> 03:38:20,670
She got out.

3733
03:38:20,870 --> 03:38:21,970
Durability high.

3734
03:38:22,390 --> 03:38:22,510
Ooh!

3735
03:38:22,870 --> 03:38:23,910
An exchange of blows.

3736
03:38:23,990 --> 03:38:25,270
A slap in the face.

3737
03:38:26,190 --> 03:38:26,470
Ooh!

3738
03:38:26,730 --> 03:38:27,350
Come on!

3739
03:38:27,770 --> 03:38:28,610
Let's go!

3740
03:38:30,270 --> 03:38:30,830
Ay!

3741
03:38:31,590 --> 03:38:32,090
Ay!

3742
03:38:33,630 --> 03:38:34,850
Why'd you punch me?

3743
03:38:34,850 --> 03:38:35,130
Ay!

3744
03:38:35,330 --> 03:38:36,770
Nothing but back and forth here.

3745
03:38:36,950 --> 03:38:37,690
And a counter.

3746
03:38:39,130 --> 03:38:39,390
Oh!

3747
03:38:39,610 --> 03:38:40,350
Oh, I'm blooded.

3748
03:38:41,330 --> 03:38:42,230
River's blood!

3749
03:38:44,230 --> 03:38:44,890
Nothing but blood!

3750
03:38:45,470 --> 03:38:45,470
Oh!

3751
03:38:46,010 --> 03:38:47,510
Oh, it's so over.

3752
03:38:47,890 --> 03:38:48,670
It's so over.

3753
03:38:49,230 --> 03:38:50,150
It's so over.

3754
03:38:50,570 --> 03:38:51,150
There's... Oh shit!

3755
03:38:51,330 --> 03:38:51,650
Whoa!

3756
03:38:52,090 --> 03:38:52,790
That's it!

3757
03:38:52,990 --> 03:38:53,390
That's it!

3758
03:38:53,490 --> 03:38:53,850
It's over!

3759
03:38:54,730 --> 03:38:55,470
I flew.

3760
03:38:58,050 --> 03:38:58,850
Stunner is real.

3761
03:38:59,030 --> 03:38:59,470
Stunner is real.

3762
03:38:59,590 --> 03:39:01,010
Oh, not my legs, not my legs.

3763
03:39:01,350 --> 03:39:02,430
Oh, no, no.

3764
03:39:03,410 --> 03:39:07,210
Okay, this match is gonna be probably a... Oh, Rivers!

3765
03:39:07,530 --> 03:39:07,530
Oh!

3766
03:39:08,510 --> 03:39:10,230
This match is closer than I expected.

3767
03:39:10,390 --> 03:39:12,230
I thought this is gonna be a Oh, is this it?

3768
03:39:12,490 --> 03:39:13,190
Oh, is it?

3769
03:39:13,570 --> 03:39:14,870
One, two.

3770
03:39:15,570 --> 03:39:16,710
Oh, kick out.

3771
03:39:16,770 --> 03:39:17,450
Damn it.

3772
03:39:18,330 --> 03:39:19,530
Please, help me.

3773
03:39:19,710 --> 03:39:21,890
Unfortunately, Octavia, you're going to have to fight for
that one.

3774
03:39:24,090 --> 03:39:25,230
Why is this such a hard battle?

3775
03:39:25,230 --> 03:39:26,050
Rapping each other again.

3776
03:39:26,390 --> 03:39:27,290
Throw it again.

3777
03:39:27,610 --> 03:39:28,430
Into the corner.

3778
03:39:29,090 --> 03:39:30,050
Octavia with the advantage.

3779
03:39:30,310 --> 03:39:31,170
Doing a little dance.

3780
03:39:31,610 --> 03:39:31,930
What the fuck?

3781
03:39:32,150 --> 03:39:32,870
Get puppeteered.

3782
03:39:33,290 --> 03:39:35,050
Get puppeteered.

3783
03:39:35,590 --> 03:39:36,730
Get puppeteered.

3784
03:39:37,230 --> 03:39:38,090
And boom.

3785
03:39:39,570 --> 03:39:40,290
It's over.

3786
03:39:40,490 --> 03:39:40,990
It's over.

3787
03:39:41,210 --> 03:39:42,230
It's over.

3788
03:39:42,450 --> 03:39:42,710
It's that.

3789
03:39:42,810 --> 03:39:44,030
Oh, what are you doing, referee?

And you're calling me a masochist, Jesus Christ.

3821
03:41:20,250 --> 03:41:21,770
You're begging for insults.

3822
03:41:21,830 --> 03:41:22,050

Learn some humility.

3826
03:41:25,590 --> 03:41:26,350
We're in another chat.

3827
03:41:26,350 --> 03:41:26,790
What's the line?

3828
03:41:26,790 --> 03:41:27,990
I feel like I lost.

3829
03:41:28,070 --> 03:41:29,890
Any afterthoughts after this fight?

3830
03:41:32,170 --> 03:41:32,330
No.

3831
03:41:32,330 --> 03:41:32,930
I have no thoughts.

3832
03:41:33,310 --> 03:41:34,130
Just depression.

3833
03:41:34,190 --> 03:41:34,830
No thoughts.

3834
03:41:34,910 --> 03:41:38,530
That entire fight felt like no thoughts had empty.

3835
03:41:41,390 --> 03:41:41,950
Bam.

3836
03:41:42,930 --> 03:41:44,210
Indifference hurts more.

03:41:45,130 --> 03:41:46,030
Yes, it does, bro.

03:42:38,270 --> 03:42:39,110
What is happening?

3870
03:42:39,550 --> 03:42:39,750
Why?

3871
03:42:42,050 --> 03:42:42,530
Okay.

3872
03:42:42,830 --> 03:42:43,470
Oh, what?

3873
03:42:44,170 --> 03:42:44,370

Battle two.

3879
03:42:51,430 --> 03:42:52,710
The twins are here.

3880
03:42:53,410 --> 03:42:54,410
I thought that was a joke.

3881
03:42:54,650 --> 03:42:55,210
What the fuck?

3882
03:42:55,990 --> 03:42:56,630
Are they here?

3883
03:42:57,170 --> 03:42:57,890
It's real.

3884
03:42:58,410 --> 03:42:58,850
They're actually here?

3885
03:43:00,530 --> 03:43:01,390
Oh, my fucking god.

3886
03:43:01,630 --> 03:43:02,730
Betal one and Betal two.

3887
03:43:03,410 --> 03:43:04,190
Hey, everybody.

3888
03:43:04,550 --> 03:43:04,870
Good to see.

3889
03:43:05,610 --> 03:43:06,250
Wait, no.

3890
03:43:06,290 --> 03:43:06,910
Excuse me.

3891
03:43:08,030 --> 03:43:08,050
Excuse me.

3892
03:43:08,050 --> 03:43:08,450
Excuse me.

3893
03:43:08,890 --> 03:43:09,410
No, no.

3894
03:43:09,590 --> 03:43:11,190
I've been suffering from a terrible call.

3895
03:43:11,210 --> 03:43:13,610
I just been having a hard time recently.

3896
03:43:13,990 --> 03:43:14,530
Hey, everybody.

3897
03:43:14,810 --> 03:43:15,470
How's it going?

3898
03:43:16,550 --> 03:43:18,890
Yeah, you're going to be suffering from a little bit more
after this.

3899
03:43:19,510 --> 03:43:21,890
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

3900
03:43:22,390 --> 03:43:23,490
Trash talking starts immediately.

3901
03:43:24,510 --> 03:43:25,470
Listen, listen, listen.

3902
03:43:25,830 --> 03:43:28,970
We might be twins, but we are also fraternal twins.

3903
03:43:29,250 --> 03:43:31,150
That means our fighting styles will be different.

3904
03:43:31,750 --> 03:43:36,170
And frankly, frankly, this is payback for taking all the
nutrients in the womb.

3905
03:43:37,910 --> 03:43:40,070
I mean, you're not going to use them.

3906
03:43:41,210 --> 03:43:49,070
twins relate everybody twins relate well would you like to
explain how your uh fighting styles differ well mine is a

3907
03:43:49,070 --> 03:43:58,970
winning style and his is a losing style so it is kind of a
drastic difference if you if you catch my drip well we'll

3908
03:43:58,970 --> 03:44:05,430
we'll see brother we'll see which one of us has the
recessive genes and the dominant ones well i don't even know

3909
03:44:05,430 --> 03:44:07,110
what that means i don't even know what that

3910
03:44:11,310 --> 03:44:14,430
This is a family feud for sure.

3911
03:44:14,430 --> 03:44:15,250
It is personal.

3912
03:44:15,430 --> 03:44:15,990
It sure is.

3913
03:44:16,250 --> 03:44:16,670
It's personal.

3914
03:44:17,150 --> 03:44:18,330
I know you guys are fighting.

3915
03:44:18,470 --> 03:44:20,450
This is a rivalry that started from the womb.

3916
03:44:21,010 --> 03:44:21,330
Oh, God.

3917
03:44:21,550 --> 03:44:21,910
The tomb.

3918
03:44:22,570 --> 03:44:28,230
Well, I know you guys are fighting, but how does it feel to,
you know, be in the same room as each other after a while?

3919
03:44:29,230 --> 03:44:31,970
You know, terrible.

3920
03:44:32,570 --> 03:44:32,730
Oh.

3921
03:44:32,830 --> 03:44:33,650
Honestly, awful.

3922
03:44:33,930 --> 03:44:34,630
It's really bad.

3923
03:44:34,770 --> 03:44:38,850
I honestly, this guy's been pissing me off for too long.

3924
03:44:39,470 --> 03:44:39,910
I'm done with that.

3925
03:44:39,910 --> 03:44:41,110
It was a surprise to be here.

3926
03:44:41,210 --> 03:44:45,270
And I'm not, not a good surprise, a bad surprise that I have
to fight him, honestly.

3927
03:44:45,890 --> 03:44:46,750
Stray you in there!

3928
03:44:46,970 --> 03:44:47,750
You're gonna die!

3929
03:44:48,530 --> 03:44:49,650
They love each other.

3930
03:44:50,090 --> 03:44:50,390
Yeah.

3931
03:44:50,910 --> 03:44:51,810
And I love him.

3932
03:44:52,430 --> 03:44:52,990
I love him.

3933
03:44:54,190 --> 03:44:54,670
Aww.

3934
03:44:55,590 --> 03:44:58,230
None of that, ooh, sucky-wucky stuff here.

3935
03:44:58,350 --> 03:44:59,390
It's all violence.

3936
03:45:00,070 --> 03:45:00,490
Oh, okay.

3937
03:45:00,890 --> 03:45:01,110
Well.

3938
03:45:01,650 --> 03:45:04,490
Well, I wish both of you the best of luck.

3939
03:45:04,790 --> 03:45:09,410
I definitely don't have bias and who wins in this match
either, but...

3940
03:45:09,410 --> 03:45:10,270
I'm curious, though.

3941
03:45:10,810 --> 03:45:11,010
Yeah.

3942

wins match for one fall introducing first.

3949
03:46:12,350 --> 03:46:17,110
He is the bipedal gas pedal battle one.

3950
03:46:20,550 --> 03:46:21,870
That's horrifying.

3951
03:46:22,610 --> 03:46:22,890
It is.

3952
03:46:23,030 --> 03:46:23,510
What is his face?

3953
03:46:23,530 --> 03:46:24,970
I'm just looking at it in horror.

3954
03:46:25,410 --> 03:46:26,730
What the hell is that?

3955
03:46:27,290 --> 03:46:28,010
What is that?

3956
03:46:29,010 --> 03:46:33,270
His face is just plastered on human, on a human head.

3957
03:46:34,010 --> 03:46:34,930
What the hell?

3958
03:46:36,310 --> 03:46:40,750
Does he have like a skin suit that he's wearing over his
head or face?

3959
03:46:41,070 --> 03:46:42,310
There's a fucking skin walker.

3960
03:46:45,710 --> 03:46:56,370
Introducing his opponent straight from the same room, the
rebel who meddles Battle 2!

3961
03:46:57,550 --> 03:46:58,890
Wow, this is really nice!

3962
03:46:59,230 --> 03:47:01,610
Very unexpected turn of events.

3963
03:47:01,710 --> 03:47:05,950
I didn't think we'd be seeing Battle 2 fight Battle 1.

3964
03:47:06,310 --> 03:47:09,090
I thought it was like a joke at the beginning.

3965
03:47:09,830 --> 03:47:11,490
And it turns out it's actually fucking real.

3966
03:47:12,550 --> 03:47:16,070
Yeah, it's like a battle versus battle and his own character
creation.

3967
03:47:16,370 --> 03:47:17,830
But look at this right now.

3968
03:47:18,290 --> 03:47:19,610
A surprising turn of events.

3969
03:47:20,730 --> 03:47:21,370
This is so weird.

3970
03:47:21,550 --> 03:47:24,150
This battle two looks more British than the battle one.

3971
03:47:25,790 --> 03:47:27,090
The winner should replace the battle.

3972
03:47:28,930 --> 03:47:29,170
Oh.

3973
03:47:30,030 --> 03:47:30,470
Oh.

3974
03:47:30,650 --> 03:47:31,450
Yeah, that should be a thing.

3975
03:47:31,570 --> 03:47:33,310
This is a battle to beat a battle.

3976
03:47:34,230 --> 03:47:35,610
Who's going to beat a battle one?

3977
03:47:44,210 --> 03:47:45,590
All bets on Tubert.

3978
03:47:45,870 --> 03:47:46,810
Yeah, thank you for the super chat.

3979
03:47:46,950 --> 03:47:47,270
Thank you.

3980
03:47:47,410 --> 03:47:47,890
Thank you.

3981
03:47:51,950 --> 03:47:52,910
Okay, let's go.

3982
03:47:53,110 --> 03:47:53,470
Let's go.

3983
03:47:53,810 --> 03:47:53,990
All right.

3984
03:47:54,230 --> 03:47:54,750
All right.

3985
03:47:54,950 --> 03:47:55,450
I'm excited to see.

3986
03:47:55,570 --> 03:47:57,370
Here it is.

3987
03:47:57,430 --> 03:47:59,130
The Battle of the Century.

3988
03:47:59,890 --> 03:48:01,490
On this corner is Battle.

3989
03:48:01,970 --> 03:48:05,050
And on that corner is Battle 2.

3990
03:48:05,930 --> 03:48:06,410
Fight.

3991
03:48:06,830 --> 03:48:07,430
Oh, my God.

3992
03:48:08,450 --> 03:48:09,950
They did the same thing!

3993
03:48:09,950 --> 03:48:11,290
They did the same thing!

3994
03:48:11,910 --> 03:48:13,830
Twins through and through!

3995
03:48:15,070 --> 03:48:16,330
Battle of the Century and a Kick!

3996
03:48:16,630 --> 03:48:17,130
They share the same genetics!

3997
03:48:17,730 --> 03:48:19,870
Oh my god, this is hype as hell!

3998
03:48:22,150 --> 03:48:24,830
Battle 1 turns out to be the Battle 1!

3999
03:48:25,230 --> 03:48:26,290
And he's the way of sub-assault!

4000
03:48:26,630 --> 03:48:28,510
High flyer Battle 1!

4001
03:48:29,030 --> 03:48:30,050
High flying technique!

4002
03:48:30,050 --> 03:48:30,810
With a creepy ass face!

4003
03:48:32,330 --> 03:48:33,230
Right in the nuts!

4004
03:48:33,230 --> 03:48:34,390
Right in the groin!

4005
03:48:35,710 --> 03:48:36,150
Oh!

4006
03:48:38,350 --> 03:48:41,750
I can't... This is the most... I like that they started out
just sprinting towards each other.

4007
03:48:42,110 --> 03:48:45,390
Like, their immense hatred for each other is just that
strong.

4008
03:48:45,690 --> 03:48:47,370
They immediately just started running.

4009
03:48:47,630 --> 03:48:48,430
They didn't even think!

4010
03:48:48,670 --> 03:48:50,750
They just did the same technique without even thinking.

4011
03:48:51,270 --> 03:48:51,990
That is insane.

4012
03:48:52,290 --> 03:48:54,110
That's... that's what they did in the womb.

4013
03:48:55,150 --> 03:48:56,410
Who started kicking first?

4014
03:48:56,870 --> 03:48:57,650
Betel or Bell?

4015
03:48:57,830 --> 03:48:58,450
Bell 2.

4016
03:48:59,770 --> 03:49:00,490
Ask your mom.

4017
03:49:00,510 --> 03:49:01,230
At the same time.

4018
03:49:02,470 --> 03:49:03,750
Mom, who kicked first?

4019
03:49:04,330 --> 03:49:06,510
Oh, apparently, Betel 2 kicked first.

4020
03:49:06,510 --> 03:49:07,510
And whoa!

4021
03:49:07,550 --> 03:49:08,690
Battle mom, who do you love more?

4022
03:49:08,830 --> 03:49:09,510
Battle one or battle two?

4023
03:49:09,950 --> 03:49:10,350
Who's your favorite?

4024
03:49:10,570 --> 03:49:10,790
Oh, shit!

4025
03:49:11,390 --> 03:49:12,190
Oh, goddamn.

4026
03:49:13,330 --> 03:49:13,870
God damn.

4027
03:49:14,010 --> 03:49:14,870
Now they're outside.

4028
03:49:15,150 --> 03:49:15,970
A little bit of a hug.

4029
03:49:16,210 --> 03:49:17,790
A sweet family reunion moment.

4030
03:49:18,150 --> 03:49:19,630
And oh, oh, not really.

4031
03:49:19,910 --> 03:49:20,530
And oh!

4032
03:49:22,450 --> 03:49:25,790
They do not really love each other at this moment.

4033
03:49:25,810 --> 03:49:27,290
This is a hype as hell battle.

4034
03:49:27,990 --> 03:49:28,450
It is.

4035
03:49:28,690 --> 03:49:29,070
It is.

4036
03:49:29,430 --> 03:49:32,390
Blood rivalry has always been like the hype as shit.

4037
03:49:32,670 --> 03:49:36,490
Like, who is the most dominant between like, um, siblings?

4038
03:49:36,510 --> 03:49:44,370
and shift they've always been compared that's so aggressive
aggressive and personal they're considering their emotions

4039
03:49:44,370 --> 03:49:58,290
oh that's a great taunt going back into ring giving him a
chance oh riding on that back oh smash the face kicking two

4040
03:49:58,290 --> 03:50:06,050
Burton to the ground pummeling him down raiding supreme oh
he just jumped oh went back inside what is this back what is

4041
03:50:06,510 --> 03:50:24,810

was a huge fumble but Willis fumble though oh because he

4042
03:50:24,810 --> 03:50:35,610
wears glasses they both fumbled the same person I can't tell
which one is which

4043
03:50:38,830 --> 03:50:42,010
Oh, they didn't even give him a chance to stand up.

4044
03:50:42,290 --> 03:50:42,890
The disrespect.

4045
03:50:43,790 --> 03:50:44,530
Leg locking him.

4046
03:50:45,170 --> 03:50:45,570
Oh.

4047
03:50:46,650 --> 03:50:47,150
Ow.

4048
03:50:48,150 --> 03:50:48,410
Ow.

4049
03:50:48,630 --> 03:50:50,670
He's not going to be standing up for a few seconds.

4050
03:50:51,550 --> 03:50:53,550
Oh, oh, oh, arm, arm, arm.

4051
03:50:54,270 --> 03:50:54,770
Twisting.

4052
03:50:54,790 --> 03:50:55,710
Oh, you're going to dislocate that arm.

4053
03:50:56,230 --> 03:50:57,050
Oh, what?

4054
03:50:57,930 --> 03:50:59,850
And a taunt here and there.

4055
03:51:01,830 --> 03:51:05,690
Who do you think is going to win, Octavio, based on the
current fight right now?

4056
03:51:06,510 --> 03:51:12,190
still rooting for battle one better one because i kind of
like changed my opinion right now i think battle two is

Don't do this at home, kids.

4061
03:51:36,170 --> 03:51:37,210
Oh, clothesline.

4062
03:51:37,570 --> 03:51:39,570
That clothesline was really hard.

4063
03:51:40,290 --> 03:51:41,170
Oh, shit.

4064
03:51:41,470 --> 03:51:41,850
Oh, God.

4065
03:51:42,630 --> 03:51:43,150
Eyo!

4066
03:51:43,850 --> 03:51:47,490
Oh, he just walked away.

4067
03:51:47,610 --> 03:51:48,590
Not even worth running.

4068
03:51:48,870 --> 03:51:50,190
Not even...

4069
03:51:50,190 --> 03:51:51,390
Oh, what are you doing?

4070
03:51:51,550 --> 03:51:52,690
In the size of Betelgeuse.

4071
03:51:53,630 --> 03:51:55,030
Oh, what the fuck are you doing, Betelgeuse?

4072
03:51:55,610 --> 03:51:56,130
Betelgeuse!

4073
03:51:58,730 --> 03:51:59,970
This is scripted.

4074
03:52:00,150 --> 03:52:00,710
That's so stupid.

4075
03:52:01,010 --> 03:52:03,030
loves Gavis Battle.

4076
03:52:03,870 --> 03:52:07,250
Tubert, I know you love your brother, but you don't have to
fumble that, obviously, alright?

4077
03:52:07,750 --> 03:52:07,990
Alright?

4078
03:52:09,750 --> 03:52:11,470
He failed to land it.

4079
03:52:12,850 --> 03:52:14,030
Now we know who's gonna win.

4080
03:52:17,230 --> 03:52:17,470
Oh!

4081
03:52:19,850 --> 03:52:23,630
They both jumped at the same time, but doing the pin is
Tubert 1!

4082
03:52:24,350 --> 03:52:25,270
And a count to 1.

4083
03:52:25,270 --> 03:52:25,750
Just a 1 count.

4084
03:52:27,450 --> 03:52:29,630
Bettle is more sturdy than I thought.

4085
03:52:30,310 --> 03:52:37,590
You guys see is but to be fair they have not landed a
finisher just yet and look at that look at that headstand

4086
03:52:37,590 --> 03:52:51,890
flexing and he's dead no he's not his c3 is hurting oh oh
dirty move dirty move that took him out wait for a battle to

4087
03:52:51,890 --> 03:52:57,070
show his signature move the low blow oh oh that is the
finisher is this

4088
03:53:01,190 --> 03:53:01,670
Three!

Even though it was short, that was like a very hype as hell.

4095
03:53:26,530 --> 03:53:28,890
I hope they don't have any hard feelings though after this.

4096
03:53:29,230 --> 03:53:30,950

You guys did amazing.

4109
03:55:04,310 --> 03:55:08,090
It was very, it was a very, very even, even match.

4110
03:55:08,390 --> 03:55:08,490
Yeah.

4111
03:55:08,750 --> 03:55:09,310
Evenly matched.

4112
03:55:11,150 --> 03:55:12,970
Literally and metaphorically.

4113
03:55:13,790 --> 03:55:13,870
Mm-hmm.

4114
03:55:14,010 --> 03:55:14,210
Yeah.

4115
03:55:14,350 --> 03:55:18,670
It only relied on the person who would do the finisher first
and Bell came out on top.

4116
03:55:19,050 --> 03:55:19,290
Yeah.

4117
03:55:19,310 --> 03:55:19,490
Yeah.

4118
03:55:19,650 --> 03:55:22,650
I was really surprised when you both did the same move at
the beginning.

4119
03:55:23,070 --> 03:55:23,270
That was sick.

4120
03:55:23,970 --> 03:55:24,410
Yeah.

4121
03:55:24,670 --> 03:55:25,370
That was cool.

4122
03:55:25,810 --> 03:55:26,830
I didn't think you'd be doing the same moves.

4123
03:55:27,110 --> 03:55:28,390
Was that planned or was it not?

4124
03:55:28,470 --> 03:55:29,570
Like, let's talk about this.

4125
03:55:29,630 --> 03:55:30,530
Let's use the same technique.

4126
03:55:31,010 --> 03:55:36,970
i mean i mean you know we're twins we're thinking the same
thing we had a psychological advantage on each other yeah oh

4127
03:55:36,970 --> 03:55:44,830
yeah it's twin things i guess but what we can't take away is
that the winner is bettel saying that you should be careful

04:03:36,830 --> 04:03:38,230
He's very convincing, man.

4254
04:03:38,710 --> 04:03:40,110
He's ready and raring to go.

4255
04:03:41,150 --> 04:03:43,130
But hey, he's got that dog in him, though.

4256
04:03:43,390 --> 04:03:46,070
Wait, it has Axel's hair on the dog.

4257
04:03:46,230 --> 04:03:49,230
Yeah, it's poorly textured, but it's there.

4258
04:03:50,750 --> 04:03:52,210
Damn, you even got the chains.

04:04:26,410 --> 04:04:28,210

It's just a muscle suit.

4269
04:04:39,990 --> 04:04:40,710
It's not even real.

4270
04:04:40,910 --> 04:04:41,610
It's really thin inside.

4271
04:04:43,990 --> 04:04:44,690
Rubbing it.

4272
04:04:44,870 --> 04:04:45,810

4289
04:05:41,810 --> 04:05:42,210
Countered.

04:05:43,130 --> 04:05:45,770
Oh, technically a hit, but a miss.

4291
04:05:49,090 --> 04:05:49,770
Will it be enough?

4292
04:05:50,010 --> 04:05:50,730
Hold on to the rope.

4293
04:05:50,850 --> 04:05:51,450
Hold on to the rope.

4294
04:05:51,570 --> 04:05:52,390
Oh, he can't get more than that.

4295
04:05:52,410 --> 04:05:53,450
Okay, it wasn't enough.

4296
04:05:56,770 --> 04:05:59,670
Oh, oh, oh.

4297
04:06:00,410 --> 04:06:01,830
Throw him to the ringside.

4298
04:06:02,170 --> 04:06:03,270
And knee to the face.

4299
04:06:03,370 --> 04:06:03,830
What is that?

4300
04:06:04,370 --> 04:06:05,910
Oh, my God.

4301
04:06:07,010 --> 04:06:08,330
A quick leverage out of the way.

4302
04:06:08,730 --> 04:06:09,010
He recovered for that.

4303
04:06:11,670 --> 04:06:12,810
Both heavy hitters.

4304
04:06:12,870 --> 04:06:13,530
Oh, this is going to hurt.

4305
04:06:13,690 --> 04:06:14,210
This is going to hurt.

4306
04:06:14,530 --> 04:06:14,690
Carry.

4307
04:06:14,890 --> 04:06:15,430
Oh, the railing.

04:06:16,650 --> 04:06:17,850
Is that allowed?

4309
04:06:18,470 --> 04:06:18,950
Disqualification.

4310
04:06:19,130 --> 04:06:19,570
You're using.

4311
04:06:21,070 --> 04:06:22,390
That should be disqualification.

The beautiful face.

4317
04:06:59,710 --> 04:07:00,170
Okay, okay.

4318
04:07:00,250 --> 04:07:01,430
The old days of wrestling.

4319
04:07:01,490 --> 04:07:01,650
We're back, we're back.

4320
04:07:02,930 --> 04:07:03,450
This might be it.

4321
04:07:03,690 --> 04:07:04,610
Oh, what's an attack?

4322
04:07:04,930 --> 04:07:05,790
Oh, what the fuck?

4323
04:07:06,510 --> 04:07:07,690
Axel doing a taunt.

4324
04:07:08,070 --> 04:07:08,730
Is it worth it?

4325
04:07:09,730 --> 04:07:12,690
You could have used that time to actually, oh, grinding the
face!

4326
04:07:16,790 --> 04:07:18,950
Don't do that to the Jaguar face.

4327
04:07:19,150 --> 04:07:20,330

King, you better get up.

4337
04:08:44,610 --> 04:08:46,290
How many seconds have you been outside?

4338
04:08:47,010 --> 04:08:47,050
Two.

4339
04:08:47,190 --> 04:08:47,730
Oh, okay, two.

4340
04:08:47,830 --> 04:08:48,510
It got reset.

4341
04:08:49,510 --> 04:08:50,730
The dog loves it outside.

4342
04:08:50,730 --> 04:08:51,570
The match is rigged against Doki.

4343
04:08:52,150 --> 04:08:52,890
And Opah!

4344
04:08:53,370 --> 04:08:53,730
Stun!

4345
04:08:54,970 --> 04:08:56,370
But she's outside.

4346
04:08:56,730 --> 04:08:58,230
You need to get her in.

4347
04:08:58,430 --> 04:08:58,790
Four.

4348
04:08:59,390 --> 04:08:59,510
Four.

4349
04:09:00,970 --> 04:09:02,090
Well, she's going to stand up.

4350
04:09:02,310 --> 04:09:04,030
The stun meter is refreshed.

4351
04:09:05,890 --> 04:09:06,890
They're going back in.

4352
04:09:08,410 --> 04:09:08,910
Doki?

4353
04:09:09,010 --> 04:09:10,890
Oh, is Doki running away?

4354
04:09:12,030 --> 04:09:12,830
Oh no!

4355
04:09:14,510 --> 04:09:15,710
Axel, let her in!

4356
04:09:16,110 --> 04:09:17,070
Resetting the timer!

4357
04:09:18,870 --> 04:09:20,850
Axel's not giving Doki a chance!

4358
04:09:21,510 --> 04:09:22,090
Come back!

4359
04:09:22,210 --> 04:09:23,270
Come back in real!

4360
04:09:24,030 --> 04:09:25,270
Oh, it wasn't enough.

4361
04:09:25,950 --> 04:09:28,590
Gravel, is it in favor of Axel or...

4362
04:09:28,590 --> 04:09:29,470
Oh, it's in favor of Doki.

4363
04:09:29,470 --> 04:09:30,650
I think this might be the final thing.

4364
04:09:31,310 --> 04:09:31,610
Is it?

4365
04:09:32,090 --> 04:09:32,650
Is it?

4366
04:09:32,750 --> 04:09:33,010
Is it?

4367
04:09:33,090 --> 04:09:33,350
Is it?

4368
04:09:33,370 --> 04:09:33,730
Is it?

4369
04:09:34,290 --> 04:09:35,070
Oh, yeah!

4370
04:09:35,910 --> 04:09:36,530
Oh, another one.

4371
04:09:36,790 --> 04:09:36,950
Another one.

4372
04:09:37,130 --> 04:09:37,870
This is like...

4373
04:09:37,870 --> 04:09:38,930
Suplex continuous.

4374
04:09:39,430 --> 04:09:40,090
And another one.

4375
04:09:40,390 --> 04:09:41,350
This is definitely King!

4376
04:09:41,370 --> 04:09:43,430
King from Tekken!

4377
04:09:44,210 --> 04:09:45,190
It's Jover!

4378
04:09:45,970 --> 04:09:46,610
Oh, stunned.

4379
04:09:46,810 --> 04:09:47,950
The finisher has been sent.

4380
04:09:48,430 --> 04:09:48,990
Pin, pin, pin, pin.

4381
04:09:49,350 --> 04:09:50,110
Is it enough?

4382
04:09:51,330 --> 04:09:53,370
One, two, three!

4383
04:09:53,630 --> 04:09:56,110
Stop slapping the dog's face, referee.

4384
04:09:56,350 --> 04:09:58,150
Please, please, you're not helping.

4385
04:09:59,970 --> 04:10:04,170
Not gonna lie, that move though kind of reminds me of King
from Tekken.

4386
04:10:06,250 --> 04:10:08,970
The unlimited combo grapple.

4387
04:10:09,090 --> 04:10:09,590
Oh my god!

4388
04:10:11,370 --> 04:10:12,790
attack from such a big person.

4389
04:10:13,270 --> 04:10:13,990
This is it, this is it.

4390
04:10:14,250 --> 04:10:15,510
A finisher, I know this one.

4391
04:10:15,810 --> 04:10:16,630
It's a default finisher.

4392
04:10:17,010 --> 04:10:17,150
Oh!

4393
04:10:18,610 --> 04:10:19,290
No, it isn't!

4394
04:10:19,390 --> 04:10:19,790
Oh!

4395
04:10:20,250 --> 04:10:21,010
Again, again, again!

4396
04:10:21,650 --> 04:10:22,710
One more in a three.

4397
04:10:23,310 --> 04:10:24,070
Oh, one more.

4398
04:10:24,190 --> 04:10:25,150
This is it, this is it!

4399
04:10:25,370 --> 04:10:26,230
Three, Dokey wins!

4400
04:10:26,650 --> 04:10:27,190
Sorry, Axel.

4401
04:10:27,530 --> 04:10:28,290
This is the end.

4402
04:10:28,750 --> 04:10:29,330
This is it.

4403
04:10:29,530 --> 04:10:29,790
This is over.

4404
04:10:30,370 --> 04:10:30,490
Oh!

4405
04:10:31,670 --> 04:10:32,670
Pin, pin, pin, pin, pin.

4406
04:10:32,910 --> 04:10:33,110
Stand up!

4407
04:10:33,470 --> 04:10:34,050
What are you doing?

4408
04:10:34,210 --> 04:10:34,810
Dokey knocked out!

4409
04:10:35,030 --> 04:10:35,310
Dokey!

4410
04:10:35,350 --> 04:10:35,610
What?

4411
04:10:38,770 --> 04:10:39,170
What?

4412
04:10:39,550 --> 04:10:39,950
What?

4413
04:10:40,270 --> 04:10:40,870
Axel, what?

4414
04:10:41,370 --> 04:10:41,730
Oh!

4415
04:10:45,770 --> 04:10:46,270
Huh?

4416
04:10:47,270 --> 04:10:47,770
I'm so confused.

4417
04:10:47,790 --> 04:10:48,830
This doesn't make any sense!

4418
04:10:49,330 --> 04:10:49,930
What's happening?

4419
04:10:50,470 --> 04:10:51,510
This game is rigged!

4420
04:10:52,050 --> 04:10:53,210
This tournament is rigged!

4421
04:10:53,950 --> 04:10:54,630
Axel's gonna win!

4422
04:10:55,930 --> 04:10:56,170
Ooh!

4423
04:10:57,010 --> 04:10:57,570
Pin!

4424
04:10:58,330 --> 04:10:58,610
Pin!

4425
04:10:58,610 --> 04:10:58,710
Pin!

4426
04:10:59,210 --> 04:11:00,630
Doki, I'm...

4427
04:11:00,630 --> 04:11:02,310
I'm thinking that you have a plan.

4428
04:11:02,710 --> 04:11:05,210
But Axel get your shit together because you are gonna lose!

4429
04:11:05,790 --> 04:11:06,110
Sampai!

4430
04:11:06,510 --> 04:11:07,830

What do you mean?

4594
04:29:03,980 --> 04:29:04,900
I typed in it wrong.

4595
04:29:06,120 --> 04:29:09,100
Well, that's really crazy because apparently I can't read.

4596
04:29:09,460 --> 04:29:09,460
Oh.

4597
04:29:11,000 --> 04:29:11,840
I see.

4598
04:29:12,100 --> 04:29:12,440
Okay.

4599
04:29:12,960 --> 04:29:15,500
And I just got word from the caster's desk.

4600
04:29:15,660 --> 04:29:18,040
I put my hand in my ear to look really cool while I'm doing
it.

4601
04:29:18,320 --> 04:29:20,500
But right now I'm a V-Tuber, so you can't see that.

4602
04:29:20,880 --> 04:29:27,880
So our next match, I'm getting word, is going to be no one
other than Backstage Doki coming out to the forefront.

4603
04:29:28,280 --> 04:29:29,120
She's back.

4604
04:29:29,640 --> 04:29:42,680
And her opponent is not other than Miss Sarah Saraw however
you say it she's here to fight Saraw Wait, how did it Sarah

4605
04:29:42,680 --> 04:29:46,140
Saraw I'm getting blamed in the comments right now.

4606
04:29:46,320 --> 04:29:57,080
Oh my god Let me put you guys into the castors aren't here
The castors are walking here guys Oh gosh, you guys are so

4607
04:29:57,080 --> 04:29:58,560

4610
04:30:27,500 --> 04:30:34,200
there if i win it will come out at the end yeah No, you're
not allowed to bring summons into the arena, right?

4611
04:30:34,480 --> 04:30:35,360
Yeah, that's not fair.

4612
04:30:35,880 --> 04:30:38,440
If you can bring a snake, I can bring a Jaguar.

4613
04:30:39,340 --> 04:30:41,340
But you are the Jaguar.

4614
04:30:41,640 --> 04:30:43,220
Are you not Mr. King?

4615
04:30:43,420 --> 04:30:44,720
I can have two.

4616
04:30:46,180 --> 04:30:47,820
Oh, it's not fair.

4617
04:30:48,640 --> 04:30:52,200
We're turning this whole match into a jungle at this point.

4618
04:30:52,860 --> 04:30:53,380
I mean, we are.

4619
04:30:53,620 --> 04:31:00,020
I mean, like, 99% of the people here are, I mean, 100% of us
are animals.

4620
04:31:01,760 --> 04:31:03,640
No, don't tell me is that.

4621
04:31:03,780 --> 04:31:05,040
I'm not amongst you.

4622
04:31:05,140 --> 04:31:07,260
What do you mean you literally have cat ears?

4623
04:31:07,980 --> 04:31:08,860
Bro, that's not...

4624
04:31:08,860 --> 04:31:09,640
No, these are fake.

4625
04:31:09,720 --> 04:31:10,760
They're actually canonically fake.

4626
04:31:10,860 --> 04:31:11,460
They're canonically fake.

4627
04:31:11,560 --> 04:31:12,040
I can take them off.

4628
04:31:12,180 --> 04:31:13,520
Okay, when she was like...

4629
04:31:13,520 --> 04:31:16,120
When I was like, hey, which wrestler do you want to
represent in you?

4630
04:31:16,400 --> 04:31:20,580
She was like, my chat wants the furry run, so I'm going to
pick that one.

4631
04:31:24,290 --> 04:31:25,350
Oh, my God.

4632
04:31:25,930 --> 04:31:26,350
You don't believe me.

4633
04:31:26,410 --> 04:31:27,550
I'm a caster, okay?

4634
04:31:27,670 --> 04:31:29,130
I'm going to cast against you biestly.

4635
04:31:30,170 --> 04:31:31,550
You're not supposed to be biased.

4636
04:31:32,030 --> 04:31:33,670
Yeah, I'm going to do it, okay?

4637
04:31:33,690 --> 04:31:39,750
It's my first time I can do whatever I want No, she's like
good cop, bad cop I have to let this happen It's like okay,

4638
04:31:39,750 --> 04:31:45,690

4639
04:31:45,690 --> 04:31:46,110

4640
04:31:46,330 --> 04:31:47,350
What are you gonna say to us?

4641
04:31:48,310 --> 04:31:50,990
Oh, um, everybody do your best Right?

Oh man, I...

4648
04:32:39,210 --> 04:32:40,750
Am I out of my A material?

4649
04:32:43,390 --> 04:32:44,770
In the semis?

4650
04:32:45,030 --> 04:32:46,430
Who let this child in?

4651
04:32:47,350 --> 04:32:49,690
I mean, she does some weird stuff, I don't know.

4652
04:32:50,210 --> 04:32:51,870
Why is she...

4653
04:32:51,870 --> 04:32:52,970
Who let the snake in?

4654
04:32:53,670 --> 04:32:54,350
It's true.

4655
04:32:54,570 --> 04:32:55,930
I was like, who let her have that?

4656
04:32:56,490 --> 04:32:58,850
Who let the snake in too?

4657
04:33:01,590 --> 04:33:03,450
We have two very fierce...

this dude an absolute legend Is there supposed to be like an
intro music?

4666
04:34:28,280 --> 04:34:29,000
Should we make it up?

4667
04:34:29,620 --> 04:34:31,520
I think there probably is intro music.

4668
04:34:32,640 --> 04:34:33,400
Okay, now we can hear it.

4669
04:34:33,600 --> 04:34:34,000
There she is.

4670
04:34:35,220 --> 04:34:35,860
Oh, wait.

4671
04:34:36,480 --> 04:34:36,620
Logan!

4672
04:34:41,840 --> 04:34:42,560
She's beautiful.

4673
04:34:43,320 --> 04:34:45,480
Bro, it looks like she caught out of a sarcophagus in Egypt.

4674
04:34:45,640 --> 04:34:47,820
I mean, this is eccentric, to say the least.

4675
04:34:48,720 --> 04:34:50,940
It looks like she might corrode you.

4676
04:34:51,280 --> 04:34:52,660
She's radioactive.

4677
04:34:53,420 --> 04:34:55,600
She kind of looks like she's wearing Peter Griffin's outfit.

4678
04:34:55,840 --> 04:35:06,740
gonna lie she comes here ready for combat hey yo these
chiseled features don't lie no she looks like a superhero

4679
04:35:06,740 --> 04:35:14,900
look at oh she's unleashing the beast oh my she call her a
teenage mutant ninja turtle because this radioactive person

4680
04:35:14,900 --> 04:35:25,660
is transforming the beast my god she's striking more poses
than an effing naruto hitting the effing fireball jutsu i

4681
04:35:25,660 --> 04:35:34,780
don't what she's doing we definitely got to pay our camera
guy a little bit more money all right let's go bulk bogan

4682
04:35:34,780 --> 04:35:38,320
sir ra is already putting on a show ladies and gentlemen

4683
04:35:41,720 --> 04:35:50,800
business casual but yet so fierce and wild will we see her
perform in the ring today will we see you taking a gun out

4684
04:35:53,140 --> 04:35:57,500
it's all part of that wild nature Ooh, here comes the
entrance.

4685
04:35:59,080 --> 04:36:00,780
A little saucy with it.

4686
04:36:00,960 --> 04:36:04,560
It's going to make a lean, a little bit of a zesty approach,
but oh, okay.

4687
04:36:05,460 --> 04:36:09,150
I think the cross is holding the ropes like we're making
sweet love to it.

4688
04:36:10,940 --> 04:36:12,040
And she's in.

4689
04:36:12,620 --> 04:36:14,640
I mean, this person's an actual fiend.

4690
04:36:14,760 --> 04:36:15,420
I'm not going to lie.

4691
04:36:15,500 --> 04:36:17,240
I'm a bit worried for Dokey right now.

4692
04:36:17,720 --> 04:36:20,160
This person seems a little bit unhinged, to say the least.

4693
04:36:20,600 --> 04:36:24,600
Yeah, this person is a caged animal ready to be unleashed at
any given moment.

4694
04:36:25,840 --> 04:36:36,580
uh 911 responders in the back with tasers and uh equipment
i'm getting unnamed equipment just in case it gets too feral

4695
04:36:36,580 --> 04:36:43,620
she's been known to go absolutely hog wild joki might not
make it today speaking about quip i think she's looking

4696
04:36:43,620 --> 04:36:52,180
pretty good in that department let's see how she does i
don't know man this person's like peak darwin evolution

4697
04:36:52,180 --> 04:37:00,000
right now sarah is looking insane I think she was bred
solely just for her muscle compatibility.

4698
04:37:00,480 --> 04:37:01,540
Look how built she is.

4699
04:37:01,640 --> 04:37:03,340
Look at this pure primal nature.

4700
04:37:03,760 --> 04:37:06,440
She's currently seeking and sensing her prey.

4701
04:37:07,760 --> 04:37:08,380
That's true, Blake.

4702
04:37:08,780 --> 04:37:10,540
Introducing her opponent.

4703
04:37:15,720 --> 04:37:17,780
Everybody knows the word.

4704
04:37:22,360 --> 04:37:23,160
Yoki!

4705
04:37:37,740 --> 04:37:41,400
Holy freak, this man's got the every vocal capacity of an
effing whale.

4706
04:37:41,620 --> 04:37:42,260
That's insane.

4707
04:37:42,900 --> 04:37:45,620
And here's our next challenge of the night.

4708
04:37:46,280 --> 04:37:48,380
All right, it's such a pleasure to cast her match.

4709
04:37:50,200 --> 04:37:52,800
We just witnessed an amazing fight by the king.

4710
04:37:53,200 --> 04:37:56,360
And now we're about to watch if she will bring it back
another time.

4711
04:37:56,600 --> 04:38:01,760
But she's versus an opponent who is just as fierce and feral
as Do King himself.

4712
04:38:02,500 --> 04:38:03,980
This is going to be quite intense.

4713
04:38:04,480 --> 04:38:05,760
I do have a question for you, Snuffy.

4714
04:38:05,860 --> 04:38:07,360
Do you think she's going to take off the mask?

4715
04:38:08,240 --> 04:38:10,500
I thought she might have just done it.

4716
04:38:10,720 --> 04:38:11,600
A rare mask reveal.

4717
04:38:12,040 --> 04:38:14,020
There's only three of them sold on eBay right now.

4718
04:38:14,540 --> 04:38:14,860
That's true.

4719
04:38:14,980 --> 04:38:15,320
That's true.

4720
04:38:15,480 --> 04:38:17,280
Things were never the same after the dream mask reveal.

4721
04:38:17,620 --> 04:38:19,260
So we're going to see if she keeps us on or not.

4722
04:38:19,340 --> 04:38:21,920
But she is making her way down to the arena right now.

4723
04:38:22,540 --> 04:38:24,180
Slamming her head on the metal stairs.

4724
04:38:24,700 --> 04:38:26,660
Do you think you're allowed to use that in combat here or
not?

4725
04:38:26,880 --> 04:38:28,200
I want to see some steel stair gameplay.

4726
04:38:28,200 --> 04:38:29,760
There are no rules in wrestling.

4727
04:38:29,960 --> 04:38:32,880
This is just pure wild animalistic fighting.

4728
04:38:33,840 --> 04:38:34,920
Yeah, you can say that again.

4729
04:38:35,040 --> 04:38:37,560
I mean, it's yapping Jaguar versus Serp matchup.

4730
04:38:37,720 --> 04:38:40,120
I mean, Slytherin or Hufflepuff, who's going to win this
one?

4731
04:38:40,380 --> 04:38:41,020
Wait, Gryffindor?

4732
04:38:41,300 --> 04:38:41,960
I don't know what I'm saying.

4733
04:38:43,760 --> 04:38:45,300
Anyway, I don't know, bro.

4734
04:38:45,320 --> 04:38:46,560
I didn't watch the book, okay?

4735
04:38:47,000 --> 04:38:49,380
So we're going to see how she can do here tonight.

4736
04:38:50,140 --> 04:38:51,600
Wait, can we talk to chat?

4737
04:38:51,820 --> 04:38:54,360
Can we read our commentators with the fans of saying live?

4738
04:38:55,820 --> 04:38:56,760
I'm kind of curious.

4739
04:38:56,860 --> 04:38:57,820
Am I breaking the immersion?

4740
04:38:57,980 --> 04:38:58,700
Let's find out.

4741
04:38:58,840 --> 04:38:59,020
I'm getting word.

4742
04:38:59,240 --> 04:38:59,860
I'm getting word.

4743
04:39:00,220 --> 04:39:05,440
There's a lot of people in the crowd whispering my ears
simultaneously at all a very condensed volume.

4744
04:39:06,100 --> 04:39:07,480
Watch the book, they say.

4745
04:39:07,720 --> 04:39:10,260
Oh, that's a weird quote.

4746
04:39:10,300 --> 04:39:10,980
Oh, my God.

4747
04:39:11,120 --> 04:39:12,500
She goes straight up in the suplex.

4748
04:39:12,760 --> 04:39:14,980
I mean, the 49ers are about to draft this chick.

4749
04:39:15,340 --> 04:39:18,240
And she's going and grabbing a dokey bird and throwing her
straight into the railing.

4750
04:39:18,960 --> 04:39:19,680
Oh, my God.

4751
04:39:19,700 --> 04:39:20,640
What was that move?

4752
04:39:20,880 --> 04:39:22,600
She hit the butt slam with that anime.

4753
04:39:23,280 --> 04:39:25,540
She did the peach sidebeat.

4754
04:39:26,540 --> 04:39:28,080
Oh, my God.

4755
04:39:28,480 --> 04:39:30,740
Dokey is not starting her match very strongly.

4756
04:39:30,860 --> 04:39:33,680
She has spent more time on the floor than her feet on the
ground.

4757
04:39:34,600 --> 04:39:36,060
I mean, she might be a wobble fit.

4758
04:39:36,160 --> 04:39:37,700
We'll have to see if she's a late bloomer in this situation.

4759
04:39:38,260 --> 04:39:39,620
Oh my god.

4760
04:39:40,080 --> 04:39:41,740
Oh, she's just getting her whole body.

4761
04:39:41,880 --> 04:39:43,320
Circus delayed over here.

4762
04:39:43,960 --> 04:39:46,320
The spider monkey maneuver didn't work out that well for
Sarah.

4763
04:39:46,600 --> 04:39:47,900
Now Doki Bird with the reversal.

4764
04:39:48,120 --> 04:39:49,120
She might have the upper hand.

4765
04:39:49,320 --> 04:39:49,640
Just kidding.

4766
04:39:49,760 --> 04:39:51,360
She's getting Joker live in Porte.

4767
04:39:51,400 --> 04:39:53,880
This is that kind of animalistic nature I told you about.

4768
04:39:53,960 --> 04:39:55,900
Once she's unleashed, there is no going back.

4769
04:39:55,980 --> 04:39:58,120
We will have to, oh my god, Doki.

4770
04:39:58,280 --> 04:40:00,960
I mean, we might lose the fatality in the first few seconds.

4771
04:40:01,160 --> 04:40:02,560
I never thought I'd see it live.

4772
04:40:03,260 --> 04:40:04,400
She's going through the throat.

4773
04:40:04,780 --> 04:40:09,080
Rather than take her ability to win this fight, she's
ruining her ability to win an apex game.

4774
04:40:09,560 --> 04:40:10,500
Doki is on the run.

4775
04:40:10,660 --> 04:40:14,060
She is currently hiding and screaming, begging for life
right now.

4776
04:40:14,420 --> 04:40:16,180
She is too afraid to sit back in the ring.

4777
04:40:16,400 --> 04:40:17,700
She's on the eagle kick.

4778
04:40:17,800 --> 04:40:20,000
The eagle kick of the seventh condor.

4779
04:40:20,560 --> 04:40:21,200
Oh my God.

4780
04:40:21,360 --> 04:40:21,660
I never.

4781
04:40:22,400 --> 04:40:23,220
Jesus Christ.

4782
04:40:23,360 --> 04:40:24,880
She goes for the back of the head slam.

4783
04:40:25,260 --> 04:40:26,300
I, uh, what just happened?

4784
04:40:27,120 --> 04:40:27,540
Doki.

4785
04:40:27,800 --> 04:40:29,060
Doki just rage quit the game.

4786
04:40:29,200 --> 04:40:29,660
I repeat.

4787
04:40:29,860 --> 04:40:30,320
Doki.

4788
04:40:32,200 --> 04:40:33,240
Is this stream paused?

4789
04:40:33,520 --> 04:40:34,600
I think this stream paused, Doki.

4790
04:40:35,240 --> 04:40:37,700
But we're live on a five second delay.

4791
04:40:37,720 --> 04:40:39,780
I'm sure they're actually killing each other right now.

4792
04:40:40,440 --> 04:40:40,700
They are.

4793
04:40:40,820 --> 04:40:41,060
They are.

4794
04:40:41,320 --> 04:40:42,380
Doki had to take this off camera.

4795
04:40:42,520 --> 04:40:44,760
This can no longer be broadcasted onto live TV.

4796
04:40:44,940 --> 04:40:46,800
We had to go to the backstage cameras right now.

4797
04:40:47,080 --> 04:40:49,120
Doki is currently grabbing her by the hair.

4798
04:40:49,620 --> 04:40:50,940
Oh, she's getting, oh, my God.

4799
04:40:51,200 --> 04:40:52,500
This is truly any man's game.

4800
04:40:52,860 --> 04:40:53,780
All the rules are broken.

4801
04:40:54,860 --> 04:40:55,560
They're getting back in the ring.

4802
04:40:55,720 --> 04:40:56,360
Back into the stadium.

4803
04:40:56,540 --> 04:40:57,980
I mean, there's high ground versus low ground.

4804
04:40:58,140 --> 04:41:01,040
We saw all this worked out in the Star Wars, but Doki Bird
also did see that.

4805
04:41:01,120 --> 04:41:03,000
So she is coming back into the arena now.

4806
04:41:03,680 --> 04:41:05,800
We are out of five minutes now on the ground.

4807
04:41:07,720 --> 04:41:10,880
around with a 360 kick spin off the rails.

4808
04:41:11,460 --> 04:41:12,660
That's probably what's happening.

4809
04:41:13,700 --> 04:41:15,300
Oh my god, that's exactly what happened.

4810
04:41:15,840 --> 04:41:18,900
And Sarah said Doki right over.

4811
04:41:19,980 --> 04:41:21,860
Doki is kicking her in the jaw.

4812
04:41:21,960 --> 04:41:23,520
Now she's grabbing her by the toes?

4813
04:41:23,880 --> 04:41:23,880
What?

4814
04:41:24,000 --> 04:41:25,660
Yeah, she's grabbing the toes and everything.

4815
04:41:25,920 --> 04:41:26,500
We're live on television again.

4816
04:41:26,660 --> 04:41:27,200
We're live on television.

4817
04:41:27,420 --> 04:41:28,360
We're so back in real time.

4818
04:41:28,480 --> 04:41:34,420
It looks like she's hitting it with a muffler 3000, and
Sarah is literally not feeling it this time, but she keeps

4819
04:41:34,420 --> 04:41:35,180
grabbing her feet.

4820
04:41:35,360 --> 04:41:38,820
I'm starting to think there's a little bit, again, Oh my
god.

4821
04:41:38,940 --> 04:41:44,120
This might be motivated by some odd Oh my god Four kicks.

4822
04:41:44,720 --> 04:41:46,540
Imagine how many Tessicles would have been lost just now.

4823
04:41:47,200 --> 04:41:48,380
Has to be in pieces Already.

4824
04:41:48,440 --> 04:41:56,680
Oh She just grabbed her by the left cheek And then she just
snapped her own neck Snapped her own neck That was insane.

4825
04:41:57,180 --> 04:41:59,460
And Sarah said Not today bitch.

4826
04:41:59,740 --> 04:42:03,660
Oh my Incredible kick with the flim spray I mean this is
getting violent.

4827
04:42:03,840 --> 04:42:09,220
I mean This is just Oh, it's all over.

4828
04:42:10,300 --> 04:42:11,320
Wait, she's going with the triangle.

4829
04:42:11,380 --> 04:42:11,900
She's got her.

4830
04:42:12,160 --> 04:42:12,740
This could be it.

4831
04:42:13,240 --> 04:42:13,960
It's the first one.

4832
04:42:14,100 --> 04:42:14,580
Come on, Doki.

4833
04:42:14,700 --> 04:42:15,280
It's just Doki in the match.

4834
04:42:15,300 --> 04:42:16,820
There's no way Doki goes down without a fight.

4835
04:42:17,120 --> 04:42:18,200
She's near the back of that.

4836
04:42:18,340 --> 04:42:18,940
It's free.

4837
04:42:20,200 --> 04:42:22,780
She's got that Jaguar prowl.

4838
04:42:23,340 --> 04:42:24,320
Oh, my God.

4839
04:42:24,460 --> 04:42:26,220
That was like Kiso landing on Jinxi.

4840
04:42:26,500 --> 04:42:27,980
I mean, I think she might be dead.

4841
04:42:28,280 --> 04:42:28,320
Two.

4842
04:42:28,840 --> 04:42:29,740
Oh, my God.

4843
04:42:30,500 --> 04:42:31,400
Sarah's not done yet.

4844
04:42:32,260 --> 04:42:33,940
She's about to show us the true nature.

4845
04:42:34,500 --> 04:42:37,380
Her anaconda don't want nothing unless Doki's got buns, one.

4846
04:42:38,640 --> 04:42:45,820
uh okay i don't think it was a very effective maneuver but
it did look swagtastic i'm not gonna lie maybe we can count

4847
04:42:45,820 --> 04:42:55,100
on the snake to save sarah after all this isn't looking good
oh my god god curb stopper doggy for the content she just

4848
04:42:55,100 --> 04:43:05,660
let her get back up no doggy's just toying with her oh my
god she's the king oh my god she's tossing around like a

4849
04:43:05,660 --> 04:43:09,060
five-year-old playing with a barbie doll she's just flinging
her around.

4850
04:43:09,060 --> 04:43:11,880
Jesus Christ and the legendary triple suplex.

4851
04:43:12,380 --> 04:43:13,660
This might be it, ladies and gentlemen.

4852
04:43:13,900 --> 04:43:15,820
I mean, we're getting angles for sure.

4853
04:43:16,380 --> 04:43:17,860
Uh, at 2000.

4854
04:43:18,240 --> 04:43:20,220
Oh, Sarah can still fight.

4855
04:43:21,300 --> 04:43:24,540
Unbelievable after being tossed around like a Gmod rag doll.

4856
04:43:25,620 --> 04:43:29,900
We're moving straight out of leg pin land straight into face
knee city.

4857
04:43:30,440 --> 04:43:34,340
I don't think Sarah's got much left in the tank at this
point, but don't keep her misses a knee.

4858
04:43:34,700 --> 04:43:36,080
The clutch sniff of 5,000.

4859
04:43:43,780 --> 04:43:59,060
okay oh my god this is insane this is insane and now sarah's
turned to gloat this has just become an illusion of fighting

4860
04:43:59,060 --> 04:44:07,200
they are just i think they're all just pure adrenaline at
this point whoa out of nowhere he could not fight back taps

4861
04:44:07,200 --> 04:44:13,060
out just like that here's your winner Why tap out?

4862
04:44:14,980 --> 04:44:18,400
Representing Sarah Balls!

4863
04:44:19,620 --> 04:44:20,060
Bogan!

4864
04:44:21,960 --> 04:44:23,200
And they have a snake!

4865
04:44:23,360 --> 04:44:24,060
Oh my god, they have a snake!

4866
04:44:25,020 --> 04:44:26,140
She's got the fucking snake!

4867
04:44:26,760 --> 04:44:27,800
Oh my god!

4868
04:44:28,040 --> 04:44:28,680
We get this snake!

4869
04:44:28,800 --> 04:44:30,420
No, you can't break the snake on here!

4870
04:44:30,500 --> 04:44:32,200
Who said you can break the snake in here?

4871
04:44:33,440 --> 04:44:34,760
Someone get the trick.

4872
04:44:35,300 --> 04:44:36,500
This cannot be legal.

4873
04:44:36,580 --> 04:44:38,480
We need the staff on the stage now.

4874
04:44:39,960 --> 04:44:40,400
Staff...

4875
04:44:41,100 --> 04:44:47,640
be making a guest appearance that's crazy but dude i did not
expect uh dokey bird to tap out in the final moments that

4876
04:44:47,640 --> 04:44:54,200
was a really unexpected ending i mean any man's game they
were practically both out of stamina it just became just

4877
04:44:54,200 --> 04:45:00,600
teeth and claw at that point i know i know you know sarah
might have hit it with the snake venom attack and it took

4878
04:45:00,600 --> 04:45:07,020
down her stamina over the course of the fight yeah she got
that medusa glare and put dokey down yeah i don't get the

4879
04:45:07,020 --> 04:45:12,640
flag for uh casting a game where dokey got eliminated but
hey we're back with her right now That was a fight.

4880
04:45:13,120 --> 04:45:13,980
Oh, my God.

4881
04:45:14,620 --> 04:45:15,420
Tell us about it.

4882
04:45:15,420 --> 04:45:16,300
Tell us about it.

4883
04:45:16,480 --> 04:45:19,600
Axel, like, introduced me to this app called Vibets.

4884
04:45:20,400 --> 04:45:24,500
And, you know, I got a little bit addicted there.

4885
04:45:25,080 --> 04:45:29,880
So I might have lost a fight, but end up a millionaire.

4886
04:45:30,140 --> 04:45:31,820
So that's fine with me.

4887
04:45:34,920 --> 04:45:35,800
And that's it.

4888
04:45:35,840 --> 04:45:36,740
That's really it.

4889
04:45:36,800 --> 04:45:41,080
It could have, I won't say it was rigged, but, like, I got a
hefty amount.

4890
04:45:41,100 --> 04:45:43,660
amount of cash coming in soon.

4891
04:45:44,940 --> 04:45:46,480
Sarah, your response to this?

4892
04:45:47,580 --> 04:45:50,660
All I gotta say is, you know, it's like they say in
wrestling.

4893
04:45:50,860 --> 04:45:52,300
Sooner or later, everyone taps.

4894
04:45:52,780 --> 04:45:53,820
And today it was Docky.

4895
04:45:54,260 --> 04:45:55,580
So sorry.

4896
04:45:55,900 --> 04:45:57,760
Got Doki and the Choki and it happened.

4897
04:45:58,140 --> 04:45:58,320
Oh yeah.

4898
04:45:58,540 --> 04:45:59,240
Not Rids.

4899
04:45:59,540 --> 04:46:00,300
Not Rids.

4900
04:46:04,180 --> 04:46:05,140
Oh god.

4901
04:46:05,380 --> 04:46:07,880
I can't believe it actually happened.

4902
04:46:09,760 --> 04:46:10,940
It's so cute.

4903
04:46:11,100 --> 04:46:21,400
the joke wait it actually happened yeah the ending the
finishing move right yeah well sorry can you tell us how you

4904
04:46:21,400 --> 04:46:29,580
kept yeah oh yeah what's your snake name yeah my snake name
is jinn but i mean like okay so like the the reason that my

4905
04:46:29,580 --> 04:46:34,260
wrestle looks the way it is is because we're like a package
deal but since there's two of us we would have get we would

4906
04:46:34,260 --> 04:46:42,000
have got dq'd if we went in together so we did a fusion
dance and the abomination that is bulk gorgon is a mixture

4907
04:46:42,000 --> 04:46:52,420
of me and my snake um but then what is left over is the
snake in the bag i don't know a snake barista could be so

4908
04:46:52,420 --> 04:47:02,100
buff you guys are like the wonder twins that's what they do
that's what they do call us in the streets yes two people

4909
04:47:03,140 --> 04:47:12,800
i'm one this is not you have a tomato in you don't you have
a tomato in you don't you have a I mean, it's a cosmetic.

4910
04:47:13,280 --> 04:47:15,740
It's not like I have a second person.

4911
04:47:17,000 --> 04:47:20,760
It's like me putting on a fucking hat, which I am wearing
one, too.

4912
04:47:21,020 --> 04:47:22,420
So it's like wearing two hats.

4913
04:47:22,820 --> 04:47:24,920
I feel like it's like you and your eyebrows.

4914
04:47:25,260 --> 04:47:26,960
Like, imagine if you didn't have your eyebrows.

4915
04:47:27,080 --> 04:47:28,700
Would you be half the dokey you are?

4916
04:47:28,880 --> 04:47:31,340
I feel like you would be missing a whole part of yourself.

4917
04:47:33,920 --> 04:47:35,000
I just think, you know what?

4918
04:47:35,160 --> 04:47:36,980
You know, okay, all right, fine.

4919
04:47:37,420 --> 04:47:40,240
You know, the better, the better wrestler won.

4920
04:47:40,600 --> 04:47:42,720
I'll admit, the better rest are what.

4921
04:47:42,900 --> 04:47:44,560
You were an incredible opponent, Doki.

4922
04:47:44,560 --> 04:47:49,080
Like, I'm going to take this whole thing out just to prove
that you were one of the best.

4923
04:47:49,240 --> 04:47:51,700
Yeah, okay, you got to win the finals then.

4924
04:47:51,840 --> 04:47:58,260
If you beat me and you win, that means I'm the winner, too,
because I lost to the winner.

4925
04:47:58,540 --> 04:48:00,500
So, like, technically I'm also coming with me on this.

4926
04:48:00,600 --> 04:48:02,020
I'm taking you along for the ride.

4927
04:48:02,100 --> 04:48:02,560
It's okay.

4928
04:48:02,720 --> 04:48:03,140
Yeah, yeah.

4929
04:48:03,140 --> 04:48:03,580

I need to do introduction.

4953
04:49:04,780 --> 04:49:06,720
I need to be a professional, but I don't know who the names
are.

4954
04:49:07,040 --> 04:49:07,580
Oh, my God.

4955
04:49:07,660 --> 04:49:08,020
All right.

4956
04:49:08,060 --> 04:49:08,680

04:49:10,180 --> 04:49:11,600
So I actually knew the entire time.

4960
04:49:11,720 --> 04:49:12,560
I was just big trolling.

4961
04:49:12,820 --> 04:49:13,440
Yeah, yeah, take your time.

4962
04:49:13,760 --> 04:49:16,180
Okay, so first off, we are going to introduce.

4963
04:49:17,360 --> 04:49:20,500
Okay, I just saw four different names, but one of them is
definitely Octavio.

4964
04:49:21,060 --> 04:49:22,340
So what's up, Octavio?

4965
04:49:24,200 --> 04:49:24,560
Hello.

Why don't you guess, guess, like, pick, pick.

4975
04:49:35,880 --> 04:49:38,500
Okay, Octavio is a clown or is he boom man?

4976
04:49:38,640 --> 04:49:39,100
Let's see.

4977
04:49:39,120 --> 04:49:40,060
You have to pick.

4978
04:49:40,220 --> 04:49:40,660
You have to pick.

4979
04:49:40,800 --> 04:49:41,700
I'm going to guess.

4980
04:49:42,400 --> 04:49:44,380
Octavio sounds really effing quirked up.

4981
04:49:44,500 --> 04:49:45,280
I'm going to say he's the clown.

4982
04:49:45,780 --> 04:49:46,220
Yikes.

4983
04:49:47,080 --> 04:49:47,500

04:49:48,100 --> 04:49:48,280
Yikes.

4985
04:49:51,820 --> 04:49:53,240
On live TV.

4986
04:49:55,600 --> 04:49:56,320
Mr. Clown.

4987
04:49:56,500 --> 04:49:58,280

4995
04:50:07,100 --> 04:50:10,320
Well, Mr. Charlie, how does it feel to fight your Kohai.

4996

04:50:15,020 --> 04:50:16,300
He's gotta be going Octavio.

04:50:17,780 --> 04:50:18,000

04:52:38,910 --> 04:52:42,950
They both are making insane expressions upon seeing one
another.

5053
04:52:43,610 --> 04:52:44,370
Octavio.

5054
04:52:44,830 --> 04:52:45,810
In two different directions.

5055
04:52:46,390 --> 04:52:46,650
The other one.

5056
04:52:46,750 --> 04:52:51,830
The following contest is our final match for night one.

5057
04:52:53,910 --> 04:53:00,720
Introducing first Octavio.

5058
04:53:05,760 --> 04:53:07,100
That is a freaking wizard.

5059
04:53:07,660 --> 04:53:08,020
I know.

5060
04:53:08,200 --> 04:53:10,780
This dude definitely casts fireballs on the weekend.

5061
04:53:10,820 --> 04:53:12,680
It looks like he's about a...

5062
04:53:12,680 --> 04:53:13,740
He kind of looks like a jellyfish.

5063
04:53:14,140 --> 04:53:14,340
Judgment.

5064
04:53:14,640 --> 04:53:16,300
What beautiful eyeliner.

5065
04:53:16,760 --> 04:53:17,500
I just rizzed me up.

5066
04:53:17,960 --> 04:53:20,420
I'm going to need the name of his makeup artist.

5067
04:53:21,000 --> 04:53:21,780
He's got a doll.

5068
04:53:22,420 --> 04:53:22,740
I know.

5069
04:53:23,060 --> 04:53:25,460
I thought we would stop at body pillows, but apparently not.

5070
04:53:26,060 --> 04:53:27,500
That might be his sister, dude.

5071
04:53:27,980 --> 04:53:28,580
Yeah, it might be.

5072
04:53:28,600 --> 04:53:29,760
I bet it stands up on its own.

5073
04:53:29,880 --> 04:53:30,720
We'd have to find out.

5074
04:53:31,040 --> 04:53:33,240
So let's see what this man's got going on.

5075
04:53:33,300 --> 04:53:35,200
I mean, he's like a walking jellyfish.

5076
04:53:35,780 --> 04:53:36,960
He's kind of intense.

5077
04:53:37,320 --> 04:53:40,040
Oh my god, I can't look at this guy.

5078
04:53:42,520 --> 04:53:44,600
I think he might have meant to go to the raid next door.

5079
04:53:44,760 --> 04:53:45,560
I'm not going to lie to you.

5080
04:53:45,880 --> 04:53:47,460
I don't know if he knows this is wrestling.

5081
04:53:47,900 --> 04:53:50,480
This man looks like he paid 90 bucks for a six pack of
water.

5082
04:53:50,680 --> 04:53:53,300
I mean, this dude's serious business right now.

5083
04:53:54,380 --> 04:53:56,820
I mean, does he know where the camera is?

5084
04:53:56,860 --> 04:53:58,620
I don't think this guy's looked away a single time.

5085
04:53:58,980 --> 04:54:02,180
I think we would all be better off if he would buy less
avocado toast.

5086
04:54:03,200 --> 04:54:05,260
Dang, you just roast an entire state.

5087
04:54:05,760 --> 04:54:13,520
that's crazy all right he's rolling up let's see they don't
call him octavio for nothing kind of sounds like an emperor

5088
04:54:13,520 --> 04:54:24,360
name what is his legacy oh my god yo i think they might be
like a rock star maybe that's what the vibe i'm getting off

5089
04:54:24,360 --> 04:54:36,620
he's he's a rock artist i think he's just an arsonist i'm
not gonna lie he's casting fire someone in chat wrote No,

5090
04:54:36,780 --> 04:54:37,180
no, no, no.

5091
04:54:37,380 --> 04:54:38,500
It's Hatsumi Miku.

5092
04:54:39,320 --> 04:54:39,960
True.

5093
04:54:42,220 --> 04:54:52,040
And his opponent, noticed Charlie in some circles, has
defeated his brother to be here.

5094
04:54:52,420 --> 04:54:53,520
It's battle!

5095
04:54:54,140 --> 04:54:57,880
That's the one who wins.

5096
04:55:00,720 --> 04:55:03,300
There's so many little frogs on the stage.

5097
04:55:03,840 --> 04:55:05,700
I know, he's already into the arena.

5098
04:55:05,760 --> 04:55:07,300
This man works fast as frick.

5099
04:55:07,440 --> 04:55:09,420
I think he might be all about business.

5100
04:55:09,660 --> 04:55:10,620
He might be a clown.

5101
04:55:10,740 --> 04:55:14,620
He might be joking and funny and humorous, but he's all
about business here.

5102
04:55:15,160 --> 04:55:17,480
He wasn't the type of guy to tip a razor blade to his shoe.

5103
04:55:17,760 --> 04:55:19,060
I don't trust him for a moment.

5104
04:55:19,420 --> 04:55:21,120
I mean, this guy under that hat.

5105
04:55:21,440 --> 04:55:22,480
That's what I'm afraid of.

5106
04:55:22,600 --> 04:55:24,160
Wait, that was the shortest intro in history.

5107
04:55:24,400 --> 04:55:26,540
This dude's here for winning money and leaving.

5108
04:55:27,480 --> 04:55:28,820
I think that means he's ready to kill.

5109
04:55:29,520 --> 04:55:29,760
Yeah.

5110
04:55:30,120 --> 04:55:31,760
All right, well, battle versus Octavia.

5111
04:55:31,940 --> 04:55:32,860
Let's see how this one rolls out.

5112
04:55:33,060 --> 04:55:35,560
Why did he swap to an effing D-Word dress?

5113
04:55:35,760 --> 04:55:46,340
will we see kissing let's find out oh my god we're about to
see tony off pro skater kick flip riding him like a freaking

5114
04:55:46,340 --> 04:55:53,680
skateboard okay way to open up the match oh and he does it
again i mean this dude's doing more flips than me right now

5115
04:55:53,680 --> 04:56:06,160
oh oh my god oh my god oh my god okay octavia he just did a
bay blade no wait octavia's already getting he's gone Oh,

5116
04:56:06,300 --> 04:56:06,860
Beto got tossed.

5117
04:56:07,080 --> 04:56:07,940
These guys are strong.

5118
04:56:08,200 --> 04:56:10,220
Can you get their grandpa back in the retirement home?

5119
04:56:10,480 --> 04:56:11,700
I don't think he's meant to be here.

5120
04:56:13,520 --> 04:56:15,280
Oh, and just like that.

5121
04:56:15,460 --> 04:56:16,400
Oh, my God.

5122
04:56:16,660 --> 04:56:17,320
He's back up.

5123
04:56:18,240 --> 04:56:19,920
Oh, a triple back flip.

5124
04:56:19,920 --> 04:56:22,040
I hope Grandpa didn't bring his dentures.

5125
04:56:22,740 --> 04:56:23,700
Beto is here to fight.

5126
04:56:23,960 --> 04:56:25,480
Oh, my God.

5127
04:56:26,040 --> 04:56:28,760
He's flying around the match like a trapeze.

5128
04:56:28,780 --> 04:56:29,840
Is that already?

5129
04:56:30,460 --> 04:56:31,620
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

5130
04:56:31,640 --> 04:56:33,100
No, he's got more than this.

5131
04:56:33,300 --> 04:56:35,740
He's ready to show the world what he told us he was going to
do.

5132
04:56:35,760 --> 04:56:41,680
do i think octavia's already running for his life he might
get knocked off the back rope right now my man missed his

5133
04:56:41,680 --> 04:56:52,700
takedown maneuver and got head pinched into the what he's
blinded by the leds oh my god oh my god the sheer amount of

5134
04:56:52,700 --> 04:57:00,760
light reflection that octavia's outfit is causing right now
i know he's blind to smell like the lights either we can

5135
04:57:00,760 --> 04:57:01,920
definitely get him a copyright

5136
04:57:06,420 --> 04:57:11,660
The epic head slam the whip last year is probably a
equivalent of a 60-mile-an-hour car crash.

5137
04:57:12,000 --> 04:57:13,360
We're not heard this going on.

5138
04:57:13,440 --> 04:57:16,680
That was the sickest move I have ever seen in all wrestling
history.

5139
04:57:18,060 --> 04:57:20,500
That was the coolest thing I have ever witnessed.

5140
04:57:20,940 --> 04:57:24,220
Usually when guys do the helicopters by themselves, I mean,
this one's crazy.

5141
04:57:24,580 --> 04:57:28,320
I think we should hire clouds to fight more often because
that is just getting sick.

5142
04:57:28,740 --> 04:57:31,240
I mean, I think I'm watching a Yowie fold in real time.

5143
04:57:31,400 --> 04:57:32,100
I'm not gonna lie.

5144
04:57:35,760 --> 04:57:37,960
This is the Johnny Appleseed.

5145
04:57:39,500 --> 04:57:40,100
Whoa!

5146
04:57:41,200 --> 04:57:41,720
Whoa!

5147
04:57:42,260 --> 04:57:45,960
He's like a folding chair!

5148
04:57:45,980 --> 04:57:46,980
Holy shit!

5149
04:57:48,040 --> 04:57:48,740
He's not.

5150
04:57:49,420 --> 04:57:49,660
Okay.

5151
04:57:50,380 --> 04:57:54,200
Betel is taking Octavio in literally any position he can get
him in.

5152
04:57:54,340 --> 04:57:55,040
This is insane.

5153
04:57:55,560 --> 04:57:56,580
Oh my god!

5154
04:57:56,840 --> 04:58:00,100
How many back flips does he need before his back flipped
enough?

5155
04:58:00,360 --> 04:58:02,220
I think he's trying to impress you, Phil.

5156
04:58:02,960 --> 04:58:03,640
Is it true?

5157
04:58:04,260 --> 04:58:04,860
Oh my god!

5158
04:58:05,760 --> 04:58:07,740
Oh my god!

5159
04:58:07,900 --> 04:58:10,180
Oh my god!

5160
04:58:10,180 --> 04:58:11,280
Oh my god!

5161
04:58:11,620 --> 04:58:13,480
I cannot comment on this right now!

5162
04:58:13,500 --> 04:58:14,540
I'm literally making love on the stage!

5163
04:58:15,920 --> 04:58:18,720
That's half of the bag filled and now his luts are popped!

5164
04:58:19,100 --> 04:58:19,800
Oh my god!

5165
04:58:20,440 --> 04:58:21,520
Octavio's got him!

5166
04:58:21,720 --> 04:58:23,280
He's in with the epic sword!

5167
04:58:23,460 --> 04:58:24,700
What is he doing?

5168
04:58:24,980 --> 04:58:27,680
He's showing the whole world his senpai.

5169
04:58:30,040 --> 04:58:32,300
It's just getting folded like a banana.

5170
04:58:32,960 --> 04:58:33,560
Insane.

5171
04:58:33,680 --> 04:58:34,020
Octavio!

5172
04:58:34,260 --> 04:58:35,620
Oh my god!

5173
04:58:38,660 --> 04:58:49,480
damage to himself okay oh my god they're just jumping off of
each other at this point they're playing my leap frog in oh

5174
04:58:49,480 --> 04:58:58,340
right against the oh my god this is getting dirty yeah this
is getting absolutely she said not to worry about neither of

5175
04:58:58,340 --> 04:59:07,010
them look like they want to get back into the ring oh my god
combo this is it oh wait snuff you don't forget you cannot

5176
04:59:07,010 --> 04:59:13,370
pin outside of the arena so that means that currently battle
is safer being eliminated unless he's stunned until 10

5177
04:59:13,370 --> 04:59:14,370
seconds runs out.

5178
04:59:14,710 --> 04:59:15,550
It's almost there.

5179
04:59:15,650 --> 04:59:16,930
We've got seven seconds.

5180
04:59:17,290 --> 04:59:18,830
That doesn't get back in right now.

5181
04:59:19,210 --> 04:59:19,610
He's taunting.

5182
04:59:19,610 --> 04:59:20,670
But he is taunting.

5183
04:59:21,410 --> 04:59:23,850
He nearly timed out and he is taunting.

5184
04:59:24,270 --> 04:59:26,930
I'm not even sure if his head is screwed on straight
anymore.

5185
04:59:27,310 --> 04:59:28,450
I don't think it ever was.

5186
04:59:28,590 --> 04:59:29,650
I mean, this dude's tenacious.

5187
04:59:29,930 --> 04:59:30,910
He's an actual maniac.

5188
04:59:31,370 --> 04:59:33,170
I would not want to fight this guy.

5189
04:59:33,290 --> 04:59:34,270
Oh, my God.

5190
04:59:34,990 --> 04:59:37,030
You hit him with the industrial head slicer.

5191
04:59:37,490 --> 04:59:39,530
I've seen that on a live place before.

5192
04:59:40,050 --> 04:59:41,450
And now, I think...

5193
04:59:41,470 --> 04:59:42,510
I don't know.

5194
04:59:42,950 --> 04:59:43,590
Oh my god.

5195
04:59:44,110 --> 04:59:45,050
Grandpa is down.

5196
04:59:45,550 --> 04:59:45,730
He's playing dirty.

5197
04:59:46,170 --> 04:59:47,850
Grandpa got his arm snapped.

5198
04:59:49,350 --> 04:59:51,230
I hope he can cast a healing spell.

5199
04:59:51,630 --> 04:59:53,270
Oh, but that won't save him.

5200
04:59:53,430 --> 04:59:54,590
Oh, he's got him.

5201
04:59:54,670 --> 04:59:55,250
He's got him.

5202
04:59:55,430 --> 04:59:56,030
He's got him.

5203
04:59:56,170 --> 04:59:57,310
There's no way.

5204
04:59:57,530 --> 04:59:58,190
It's over.

5205
04:59:58,830 --> 04:59:59,430
It's over.

5206
05:00:00,310 --> 05:00:01,250
It's over.

5207
05:00:01,290 --> 05:00:04,210
That'll packed up Octavio in the car.

5208
05:00:04,250 --> 05:00:10,470
Here is your winner, Charlie Ben.

5209
05:00:16,960 --> 05:00:19,680
Okay, that was an insane fight.

5210
05:00:20,060 --> 05:00:24,480
I witnessed more yoga moves there than I have in the
entirety of my career in yoga.

5211
05:00:25,320 --> 05:00:27,520
I mean, that was a simply acrobatic fight.

5212
05:00:28,060 --> 05:00:32,640
I saw more skin and body angles than I did in the entire
just chatting section of Twitch.

5213
05:00:32,920 --> 05:00:33,420
That was insane.

5214
05:00:35,860 --> 05:00:39,700
I think that was a true test of wrestling supremacy right
there.

5215
05:00:39,800 --> 05:00:40,340
That was beautiful.

5216
05:00:40,560 --> 05:00:41,540
That was a true art form.

5217
05:00:42,360 --> 05:00:43,180
It was.

5218
05:00:43,280 --> 05:00:43,880
You couldn't have said it.

5219
05:00:43,900 --> 05:00:58,880
any better god damn oh was there any doubt a little bit was
there any doubt in i charlie gavis betel oh that was good

battlefield yeah we showed i'll touch each other's skin it's

5221

ground more than we were on it in that fight yeah yeah you

confidence i mean it's just the way things go do you know

5227

insane showcasing of skill i think i think you have

potential oh no he doesn't i'm gonna beat him I've already

I've already won.

Anyone can face me.

5231
05:02:18,260 --> 05:02:19,660
It's a considerate done.

5232
05:02:20,160 --> 05:02:21,680
All right, viewers, you've heard it here.

5233
05:02:22,060 --> 05:02:22,940
He's already won.

5234
05:02:23,240 --> 05:02:29,360
So let's take it back to backstage Doki coming front stage
for our last remaining things to say for today.

5235
05:02:31,260 --> 05:02:32,280
Thanks, Doki.

Don't fire me.

5237
05:02:36,060 --> 05:02:41,480
She would, all right, Philly would read anything in the
Discord chat, which I figured out.

5238
05:02:41,920 --> 05:02:53,500
I literally wrote Charlie versus Octavio and she actually
read I was like are those these guys are these guys just

5239
05:02:53,500 --> 05:03:03,120
like are they coming on to help I was too afraid to say
their names I knew him that his name was but tell but then

5240
05:03:03,120 --> 05:03:10,120
he said like three of their names so I was like are you I'll
put these is this like a 40 for the key cast confusion bro
