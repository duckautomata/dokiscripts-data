362
00:26:59,670 --> 00:27:00,990

363
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:03,050
Don't worry, Minecraft Street.

364
00:27:07,730 --> 00:27:09,390
Squiggly screens, I guess.

365
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:20,900
Wait, why won't it let me open this?

366

00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:31,920
How the hell would anyone figure that out?

00:46:42,950 --> 00:46:43,950
Hang him back home.

00:46:44,090 --> 00:46:46,200
Nothing to work.

664
00:46:46,860 --> 00:46:48,320
Stop crying, little baby.

665
00:46:48,660 --> 00:46:49,560
You have an arm.

666
00:46:52,860 --> 00:46:58,060
Teddy was the only constant and you needed a friend to solve
the last puzzle.

667
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:05,720
Fuck Teddy, we don't need Teddy.

668
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:06,820
All I have is arm.

669
00:47:07,620 --> 00:47:09,000
All I need was his arm.

670
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:12,460
Oh god, it's getting darker.

671
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:14,120

672
00:47:15,060 --> 00:47:16,660
I don't like that it's getting darker guys.

673
00:47:16,940 --> 00:47:17,380
Oh god.

674
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:21,760
Hey Teddy.

675
00:47:23,100 --> 00:47:24,240
You need my teddy back.

676
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:30,180
Stay away from me.

677
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:31,600
Oh god, please.

678
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:35,660
I don't even want him.

679
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:39,080
I never meant to.

680
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:40,260
I don't even want Teddy.

681
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:40,980
What?

682
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,220
Oh shit, hate.

683
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:46,860
Look, can I look at her?

684
00:47:56,180 --> 00:47:57,640
Dude, she's a terrible mom.

685
00:47:57,780 --> 00:47:58,560
Like, what the fuck?

686
00:48:00,220 --> 00:48:01,100
Let's go into the light.

687
00:48:01,300 --> 00:48:02,340
Hi there, little one.

688
00:48:04,180 --> 00:48:04,720
Come here.

689
00:48:08,350 --> 00:48:09,670
Did you like your gift?

690
00:48:10,930 --> 00:48:11,690
Oh, is that dad?

691
00:48:12,010 --> 00:48:12,470
Hey, dad.

692
00:48:13,350 --> 00:48:14,070
Is that acid?

693
00:48:14,610 --> 00:48:15,070
I don't know.

694
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:21,080
Acid.

695
00:48:21,540 --> 00:48:22,280
I'm sorry to hear.

696
00:48:22,780 --> 00:48:23,020
What?

697
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:25,420
I think it's getting less like it relates to this.

698
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:26,260
Yeah.

699
00:48:27,740 --> 00:48:28,280
Oh.

700
00:48:28,580 --> 00:48:29,760
We did it.

701
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:34,760
We finished the game.

702
00:48:35,700 --> 00:48:36,320
Holy shit.

703
00:48:38,220 --> 00:48:39,500
We did it.

704
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,080
beat the game.

705
00:48:42,980 --> 00:48:43,640
I'm so proud.

706
00:48:43,860 --> 00:48:44,620
We did it, chat.

707
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:45,660
We did it together.

708
00:48:46,420 --> 00:48:47,540
We didn't fucking need Teddy.

709
00:48:47,660 --> 00:48:49,720
All we needed was this fucking arm.

710
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:54,540
I don't have custody now.

711
00:49:02,970 --> 00:49:04,950
Shit, I like how there's like no music at all.

712
00:49:05,110 --> 00:49:06,210
It's just...

713
00:49:06,210 --> 00:49:06,910
Baby did it.

714
00:49:06,990 --> 00:49:07,810
Baby went up.

715
00:49:07,950 --> 00:49:08,130

718
00:49:11,490 --> 00:49:18,810

that extra weight when we all need right lesser we didn't

00:50:56,110 --> 00:50:56,870
The Andy, dude.

736
00:50:57,070 --> 00:50:58,190
There's no music.

737
00:50:58,430 --> 00:50:59,030
What the fuck?

738
00:50:59,470 --> 00:51:02,730
Wait, let me put some music on in the background while we...

739
00:51:02,730 --> 00:51:04,470
Instead of like this ominous...

740
00:51:06,710 --> 00:51:07,610
Let's have some music.

741
00:51:08,130 --> 00:51:09,210
I mean...

742
00:51:11,430 --> 00:51:19,070
That makes it better, makes it even better allegorically
since, since I missed the beginning.

743
00:51:19,650 --> 00:51:24,710
Yeah, we're, oh, some chill, chill song in the background.

744
00:51:25,170 --> 00:51:26,630
Leave it as this is.

745
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:34,780
This is like Persona 5 music in the background.

746
00:51:34,980 --> 00:51:36,600
I was like, I can't.

747
00:51:37,820 --> 00:51:38,600
It's so true.

00:51:40,780 --> 00:51:42,060

Because we're still...

761
00:52:56,780 --> 00:52:57,640
Oh, now we're at ease.

762
00:52:57,980 --> 00:52:59,580
Okay, we made it to the ease, guys.

763
00:53:00,460 --> 00:53:01,320

You know what?

766
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:06,420
Yeah, we don't need to learn about all the Eddies up there.

767
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:09,880
Do we have, like, bonus?

768
00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:12,060
Playground in the account.

00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:12,620
Museum.

770
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:14,100

00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:25,440
Alright, let's look at the museum chat.

774
00:53:25,620 --> 00:53:32,780
I like how the Persona 5 music is playing the background
while...

775
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:35,060
Okay, what the fuck?

776
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:40,320

00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:42,060
Is this Ghost Teddy?

778
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:45,760
Is he dead?

779
00:53:46,100 --> 00:53:46,860
Wait, did Teddy die?

780
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:47,400
What?

781
00:53:48,620 --> 00:53:51,620
Wait, so his arm is gone and he's dead?

782
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:53,920
Take a look around.

783
00:53:54,920 --> 00:53:56,720
Teddy's a ghost now.

784
00:53:58,100 --> 00:53:59,500
Wait, Teddy actually died.

785
00:53:59,660 --> 00:54:00,480

786
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:07,020

788
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:11,900

kid is I don't understand why Teddy has to be a good this is

802
00:56:20,180 --> 00:56:29,780
a side choice a large part of the game is based on how
children see and interpret what's happening go on the

803

807
00:57:15,180 --> 00:57:16,680
What is this?

00:57:16,740 --> 00:57:19,780
Oh, this is like a diagram.

809
00:57:20,980 --> 00:57:22,980
Patty, and he's laughing, he kind of says, okay.

810
00:57:23,220 --> 00:57:24,880
This is a forested home.

811
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:29,680
It's a crumbling home that's slowly rotting away into the
water.

812
00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:31,280
He was too scared to notice.

813
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:33,020
Yeah, I didn't see the fucking burn.

814
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:36,460
This sum tunnel was unwrapped in sea brush.

815
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:37,820
Nevertheless, they were happy.

816
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:40,200
The house here is a symbol of the family and home falling
apart.

817
00:57:40,220 --> 00:57:40,600
heart.

818
00:57:41,220 --> 00:57:48,100
The bloated creature inhabiting it is how the kid sees his
mother when she's drinking and full of sorrow.

819
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:48,780
Aww.

820
00:57:54,120 --> 00:57:56,420
This is like the designs of the house.

821
00:57:56,600 --> 00:57:57,400
Where's the monsters?

822
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:02,420
Oh, this is the... Teddy, where are you?

823
00:58:02,900 --> 00:58:05,760
How am I supposed to learn shit without Teddy here?

824
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:06,680
Wait, what?

825
00:58:09,260 --> 00:58:10,140
What's this?

826
00:58:11,320 --> 00:58:12,060
What the fuck?

827
00:58:12,140 --> 00:58:13,040
Oh, this is the exit.

828
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:14,360
I was like, what is this?

829
00:58:15,860 --> 00:58:16,700
Where's Teddy?

830
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:18,960
How am I supposed to learn anything?

831
00:58:24,460 --> 00:58:29,560
Oh, there's the monsters.

832
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:30,640
Oh, God.

833
00:58:31,580 --> 00:58:32,440
Oh, God.

834
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:34,260
What the?

835
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:36,200
Who's this?

836
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:37,340
What?

837
00:58:39,820 --> 00:58:41,400
Who's this?

838
00:58:42,460 --> 00:58:44,560
What the fuck?

839
00:58:46,260 --> 00:58:50,300
Wait, what was this here?

840
00:58:51,420 --> 00:58:51,660
Wait!

841
00:58:53,720 --> 00:58:58,820
We go back, we grab the airplane, and he looked like, wait,
it looked like that?

842
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:01,860
What the- Wait!

843
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:03,720
Excuse me!

844
00:59:05,540 --> 00:59:06,880
Yeah, fuck Teddy, dude.

845
00:59:07,060 --> 00:59:08,120
Holy shit!

846
00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:10,200
Okay, wait.

847
00:59:10,420 --> 00:59:12,920
Now this is, I know the story of how the game ended.

848
00:59:13,020 --> 00:59:13,940
It was very different.

849
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:15,880
In the early...

850
00:59:16,220 --> 00:59:23,280
it was a production back then teddy was antagonist of the
game oh actually kind of something like we don't need teddy

851
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:30,000
this whole time the lords are so well thought out though
props to the devil yeah the lord is very interesting um and

852
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:36,440
an evil entity a monster disguised as a friendly teddy bear
took advantage of this by taking the sound child into a

853
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:42,440
dangerous adventure far away from home um oh it's okay so it
was like that

854
00:59:49,500 --> 01:00:00,980
have to give him black eyes like black eyes is so unself
who's this what the fuck is this guy i know these three or

01:00:15,860 --> 01:00:17,480
oh god i don't want to look at her anymore

857
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:22,560
You completely missed him.

858
01:00:22,580 --> 01:00:23,960
Yeah, I never seen him.

859
01:00:26,260 --> 01:00:26,880
There's mom.

860
01:00:29,860 --> 01:00:31,360
And there's all the plushies.

861
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:33,520
What are these?

862
01:00:33,820 --> 01:00:34,140
Sleep?

863
01:00:34,700 --> 01:00:35,340
What are you?

864
01:00:38,220 --> 01:00:39,980
There's our very early projections.

865
01:00:40,380 --> 01:00:43,100
There wasn't a sudden decision to cut these.

866
01:00:43,220 --> 01:00:45,400
Oh, they're like...

867
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:48,880
They're all the cut creatures that were supposed to be in
this game.

868
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:52,120
what's this

869
01:00:55,870 --> 01:01:01,750
I'm guessing he's a monster and a player on stage but we
never met him because of tech gun plays yeah is that oh my

870
01:01:01,750 --> 01:01:07,230
god what the fuck is excuse me

871
01:01:11,870 --> 01:01:18,530
well okay I'm getting out of here what the fuck was that

872
01:01:21,730 --> 01:01:30,190
okay like oh oh god i'm sorry i'm sorry what's over here
wait i've

873
01:01:35,090 --> 01:01:42,610
all right teddy goes top this is the reveal this is where
you see your mother for what she is and the player gets to

874
01:01:42,610 --> 01:01:55,130
connect the various monsters and sights through the game oh
okay wait okay look what what are you gonna say ah my

875
01:01:55,150 --> 01:02:04,750
favorite place I felt we really connected here you know a
bit of a breather between the various bad nightmarish worlds

876
01:02:04,750 --> 01:02:13,130
we went to also I was able to talk a lot here as elsewhere
the developers were concerned about keeping the tension up

877
01:02:13,130 --> 01:02:22,190
and didn't want me to learn me now how scared also is it
scary get quiet when scared, so it's okay and all, but I

878
01:02:22,190 --> 01:02:24,750
like the best the times we had to catch up.

879
01:02:25,530 --> 01:02:26,290
Where's this area?

880
01:02:26,550 --> 01:02:27,150
He talked to me.

881
01:02:27,590 --> 01:02:29,890
Originally, the chase for the mom was a MacGuffin.

882
01:02:30,450 --> 01:02:36,530
You did not really find her, and the monsters used her to
lure you further into the dream lands.

883
01:02:36,690 --> 01:02:37,250

1247
01:26:22,840 --> 01:26:23,700
I have some butthards.

1248
01:26:23,820 --> 01:26:25,240
We're trying to figure out happiness.

1249
01:26:25,660 --> 01:26:27,340
The secret to happiness right now.

1250
01:26:28,040 --> 01:26:29,640
It was not playing.

1251
01:26:29,820 --> 01:26:30,720
I didn't know.

1252
01:26:33,040 --> 01:26:33,800
I did.

1253
01:26:33,940 --> 01:26:34,680
I looked at the table.

1254
01:26:34,900 --> 01:26:35,780
It wasn't table.

1255
01:26:37,480 --> 01:26:38,020
Yo, you still...

1256
01:26:38,020 --> 01:26:39,520
What makes you happy, bear?

1257
01:26:40,880 --> 01:26:41,420
Radio!

1258
01:26:41,960 --> 01:26:42,760
It's radio!

1259
01:26:43,320 --> 01:26:44,540
That's gotta be it.

1260
01:26:46,260 --> 01:26:46,680
Radio.

1261
01:26:49,640 --> 01:26:50,240
Okay.

1262
01:26:50,780 --> 01:26:51,640
How do I get up, though?

1263
01:26:52,420 --> 01:26:53,080
It's radio.

1264
01:26:53,500 --> 01:26:54,820
It has to be radio.

1265
01:26:55,080 --> 01:26:56,240
Radio equals music.

1266
01:26:56,420 --> 01:26:57,080
Music equals...

1267
01:26:57,080 --> 01:26:58,020
It's radio.

1268
01:26:58,040 --> 01:27:10,920

1279
01:28:23,860 --> 01:28:24,680

I'm not gonna go outside.

1284
01:28:44,910 --> 01:28:46,670

All I did was...

1350
01:32:56,140 --> 01:33:02,560

I don't want to restart it guys.

1352
01:33:09,600 --> 01:33:11,400
It was the roll of the chair.
