00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:49,820
Hello, everybody.

2
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:52,120
Give me a sec.

3
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,380
I'm waiting for the caffeine to kick in.

4
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,400
I know.

5
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,340
I told you guys.

6
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:02,980
And I told myself.

7
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,160
I will not take a nap before my stream.

8
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,220
I will not take a nap before my stream.

9
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,160
But my body is so weak.

10
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:18,600
And the flesh, it needed the nap.

11
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:30,000
I think the worst part was that I took a nap at 12 p.m.

12
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:34,040
And then I fucking, I was out for four hours.

13
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,840
I was out for four hours.

14
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:42,440
And if it wasn't for the alarm, I would have kept on
sleeping.

Okay, my company fired me.

49
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:51,600
It is what it is.

50
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:53,860
It's not the first time it's happened.

51
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:57,500
I'm thankful they hired me in the first place.

52
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,220
Oh god, why am I...

53
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:00,900
It's just too real.

00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:03,800
I'm thankful they hired me in the first place.

55
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:06,660
I have nothing but gratitude for the company.

56
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:10,760
My boss even cried for me when they fired me.

57
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,800
He said, I'm sorry I couldn't help you out.

58
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:20,060
told me that this company wasn't the right fit for me and
that there are other places where I could shine it was nice

59
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:28,360
for them to say that okay is there really somewhere out
there someplace that would take in a fool like me maybe all

60
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:36,020
I needed to do was find my host club all along even if I
could get another job somewhere else I would just mess

00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:50,820
everything up for the people there huh maybe my life is done
for i didn't even think it had started oh my god this is all

drink my problems away i'm pretty sure there's a bar

63
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:05,460
somewhere in this building stare i'm sorry

64
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,420
Okay, should I read what she's telling you guys?

65
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,180
Or are you going to pretend you know Japanese?

66
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:17,040
Unless you do know Japanese.

67
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:22,400
Okay, I'll read it out loud for you guys.

68
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,520
Just throwing out a guess here.

69
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,560
But does something bad happen to you?

70
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:29,340
Sorry, pretend that you can listen to Japanese.

71
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:34,460
That's why you're trying to drink and forget everything?

72
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:37,660
Or...

73
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,940
me to go to your hostess club?

74
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:46,140
Okay, I'm bringing the volume up.

75
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:46,680
Okay.

76
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,540
Let me bring the volume up, guys.

77
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,400
Sound guy wants to hear this anime girl talk to him.

78
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:53,580
You're wrong.

79
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,120
What just happened to catch my eyes before I get to work?

80
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:58,380
Don't call us out like that.

81
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,740
You look so tired as of your life is over.

82
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:05,440
Oh my god.

83
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:06,580
Guys!

84
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:08,800
Thank god there's no eye trackers.

85
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:18,360
Guys, I hope your eyes are up here or here because you need
to read what she's saying.

86
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:22,160
I hope it's up here or here, guys.

87
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,880
Not anywhere else.

88
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:30,500
You look so tired as if your life is over.

89
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:34,220
You might be right, Miss Anime Girl.

90
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:37,800
I knew it.

91
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:38,260
Yata.

92
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:42,780
Oh, sorry.

93
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:44,520
This isn't something to be happy about.

94
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,100
Oh, am I going to get taken advantage?

95
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:51,440
My financial worry is going to get worse.

96
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:55,000
I should have hit it right on the bullseye.

97
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:57,880
It's so sad to think your life is over.

98
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,860
Yeah, I know.

99
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:04,080
Someone's like, please take advantage of me.

100
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:06,320
Fuck it.

101
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,880
What should I do?

102
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:11,700
then I'll really become a tote.

103
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:18,200
But I can't leave someone so hurt out in the cold.

104
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,800
Oh, woe is me.

105
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:22,140
Debbie Mercy, thank you for the super chat.

106
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:22,980
Thank you, thank you.

107
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:25,640
My eyes are obviously in the middle so I can do...

108
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:25,740
What?

109
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,180
What do you mean?

110
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:34,380
Oh, don't worry.

111
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:35,940
I brought the volume up again.

112
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,720
Just for you sound guy.

113
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:38,560
Got it.

114
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:39,700
You don't have to come in the shop.

115
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:40,920
You can just have a sneak peek.

116
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:42,500
Oh, that's how they get you.

117
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,500
That's how they get you.

118
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:45,940
The sneak peek.

119
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,860
I don't know what's going on.

120
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:52,760
Oh, shit.

121
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:53,380
Really?

122
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:54,280
You do?

123
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:55,400
You work here?

124
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:01,360
Oh, I didn't know they opened this kind of bar there.

125
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:05,100
It's someplace where I can drink with girls.

126
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:09,800
I've never been in a shop like this before.

127
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:26,820
it's it's clean oh my god my life is a mess it's clean and
the girls are cute i guess i guess i'll give it a try you're

128
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:37,200
gonna get me in trouble sir no are you taking that money out
no sir don't take the money out oh my god we only accept a

129
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:42,340
hundred dollar bill sir and clearly you don't seem like
you're wise.

130
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:46,500
It's not, it clearly seems it's not wise to spend that type
of money.

131
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,120
So I can't come in.

132
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:53,380
That's all today.

133
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:54,820
I'll just give you a glimpse.

134
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:59,080
You come inside and I'm really a, oh no.

135
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:01,180
No.

136
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:03,440
Why did you let me see this?

137
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:11,900
If you're, if I give you the right to come to the shop as a
customer.

138
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:15,080
Whenever you're interested, I'll be waiting for you to come.

139
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,780
Mr. Toot, thank you for the super chat.

140
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:17,100
Thank you.

141
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:17,680
Thank you.

142
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:21,280
Why waste your money on host clubs when you send it to
VTubers?

143
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:22,640
They're clearly superior.

144
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,400
Thank you for the super chat.

145
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:25,000
Thank you.

146
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:25,620
Thank you.

147
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:26,180
Okay.

148
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:32,740
You send it to VTubers who are going to host this clubs so
you can get both the two experience at once.

149
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:33,100
You know?

150
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:51,700
You can live vicariously through the playing this game you
get both the vtuber and the hostess club let's see so you're

151
00:12:51,700 --> 00:13:01,180
so sincere your life isn't over you'll be okay i know you

time we can see each other oh you mean right now right all

154
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:42,860

she doesn't even know me but i guess i do feel a little

155
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:49,920
better i'm such a simple guy i see girls my my

156
00:13:54,660 --> 00:14:01,520
my self-esteem guys is help happy self-esteem

157
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:08,520
Just a simple little guy.

158
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:13,700
Now, I don't know if I really want to get drunk and forget
about everything.

159
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,120
I'm just gonna go home.

160
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,960
My self-esteem is up now.

161
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,780
My life isn't over, huh?

162
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,120
No way.

163
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,980
Why would I take something a girl said to me seriously?

164
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,120
When I don't even know her name?

165
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:45,000
She didn't seem to be joking around, but, you know, I mean,
it's not like anyone has ever told me that my life is done.

166
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:47,820
I'm the only one who thinks that.

167
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:53,560
If I don't finish it myself, maybe it's still possible to
start again.

168
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,600
Oh my gosh, that gorillas, but what if they're anime girls?

169
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:58,860

It's red.

218
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:44,810
Just like the color of her bowtie.

219
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:46,890
Right, guys?

220
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:54,670

I'll be really happy with King you a lot of lots of times.

222
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:02,030
I agree.

223
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:04,890
To do that, I have to work hard at my current job.

224
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:07,990
Well then.

225
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:11,390
Oh no, why are you looking at me like that?

226
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:16,590
The moment she put her hands up, my eyes went to the face.

227
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:22,630
Well then, I want you to be able to do your best.

228
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:25,550
So I hope I can give you lots of healing.

229
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:29,090
That makes sense.

230
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:31,410
I feel like I can work harder if I feel better.

231
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:36,750
It's the saddest.

232
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:41,890
I'm sorry.

233
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:43,250
I didn't hear your order.

234
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:45,750
Did I order something?

235
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:46,370
I'm sorry.

236
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:48,310

Maybe I'll have a drink.

240
00:19:55,610 --> 00:19:56,730
What drink did you want?

241
00:19:58,190 --> 00:19:59,850
A customer must purchase a drink.

242
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:02,750
A price your drink can increase your...

243
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:08,250
Did you hear that?

244
00:20:08,530 --> 00:20:19,030

they're trying to make me order two not because that she
wants me for my money.

254
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:09,130
It's because she's really thirsty, guys.

255
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:10,710
You don't understand.

256
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:14,650
She's just really thirsty, and I order... Oh, shit.

257
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:27,030
Anyway, it's because she's really thirsty and she saw me
order a drink that she likes because this drink is something

258
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:28,190
that women likes.

Choose your words carefully.

295
00:24:57,930 --> 00:24:59,050
It's okay, guys.

296
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:00,150
I'm a woman.

298
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:04,950
It'll be so fucked if I get this wrong.

299

302
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:21,810
The first step?

303
00:25:22,410 --> 00:25:22,630
Okay.

304
00:25:23,210 --> 00:25:24,510

Anyway, I'd love to know more about you.

311
00:25:48,930 --> 00:25:49,750
I gotta lie.

312
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:53,850
Because women don't want to know the truth.

313
00:25:55,810 --> 00:25:56,270
Right.

314
00:25:56,770 --> 00:26:00,090

00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:38,580
I naturally have my mouse in the center.

336
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:41,140
Okay, it's my turn now.

337
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:42,480
My name is Kana.

338
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:46,360
I don't mind if you give me a nickname, but I sure hope you
remember me.

339
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,380
Of course I'll remember you, Kana.

340
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,960
You never forget your first, guys.

341
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:51,920
You never forget.

342
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:55,760
All right, I'll do my best to match your name to your face
then.

343
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:56,900
Kana-chan.

344
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:57,500
Yeah.

345
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,160
Kana- Kana-chan.

346
00:27:59,360 --> 00:27:59,660
Hmm.

347
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:04,800
Hey, stop it.

348
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,320
You're making me all flustered.

349
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:11,780
I didn't know it felt this embarrassing to be stared at.

350
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:12,540
Oh, really?

351
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:15,640
Okay.

352
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,020
She's good.

353
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,840
She knows what's going to get me to open my wallet.

354
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:22,780
She's so fucking good, guys.

355
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:28,320
If I do that, I'll be like, Oh, stop it, dragons.

356
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:30,680
Oh, you're making me all flustered.

357
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:32,820
Oh, my gosh.

358
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:36,260
I didn't know it felt this embarrassing.

359
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,320
Let me stare at dragons.

360
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:39,220
Stop.

361
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:46,960
I suppose.

362
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:53,960
I suppose there are some things you need to learn from
first-hand experience.

363
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:57,920
Yeah, I guess I got a little smarter from this whole
situation.

364
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,260
Dimitri, thank you for the super chat.

365
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:01,580
Thank you.

366
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:02,220
Thank you.

367
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:03,580
Lock in, Doki.

368
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:06,920
This cute fictional girl game is less intimidating.

369
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:11,000
If you take it way too seriously and just power it through.

370
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:14,040
I am taking this so seriously, guys.

371
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:15,540
You don't understand.

372
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:18,860
I literally spent 20,000 yen already.

373
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:21,620
That is very serious.

374
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,160
Tell me more about yourself, Haito-kun.

375
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:27,620
I messed up real bad at work recently.

376
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:31,140
And because of that, the boss fired me.

377
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,980
So I've been assisting a friend at his work ever since.

378
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:39,500
Oh, that sounds rough.

379
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:45,420
Daichobu, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank
you.

380
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:46,720
And Zip's wallet.

381
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:53,040
If I was in your shoes, I probably wouldn't even be able to
eat.

382
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:57,420
Though I'm sure words can express just how awful you must
feel.

383
00:29:58,060 --> 00:30:00,440
Oh, I feel so awful, Kana.

384
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:05,040
I might need some affection right now.

385
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:08,060
All right, I've got it.

Glassware.

400
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,180
I was like, is this still a cup?

401
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:02,740
I swear, I swear there's, like, a different name for this.

402
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:07,660
But it's so fancy for beer.

All right, we'll get orange juice.

Should we eat together?

423
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:19,100
Oh my god.

We can share Parfait together.

428
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:26,860
Kana.

429
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:27,940
Yeah.

430
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,660
It tastes amazing.

431
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:31,560
I love this.

432
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:32,300
Oh, you want to?

433
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:33,660
You want some too?

434
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:35,720
Stare.

435
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:38,940
You're staring again.

436
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:40,960
Stream extension.

437
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:43,920
Adrian, thank you for the super chat.

438
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:44,240
Thank you.

439
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:45,160
Thank you.

440
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:47,980
If you think about it, it's...

441
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:49,200
Okay, this is fun.

442
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:58,960
Okay, I'm gonna say something that's, like, a bit fucked up.

443
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:03,900
But, like, the stream extension thing sort of reminds me of
Sub-A-Thon.

444
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:12,680
It's sort of like, it's Sub-A-Thon.

445
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:15,700
Because you're sub-ing to extend the stream.

446
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:17,680
I'm sorry.

447
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:22,980
Maybe I have a bad habit of staring at things like that and
trick.

448
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,760
I trick her, guys.

449
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:27,860
Don't tell me.

450
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:29,960
I have bed hair or something.

451
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:35,940
No, it's nothing like that.

452
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:41,880
I thought this when I first saw you, Haito-Kun.

453
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:45,000
But you seem like a really kind...

454
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:46,980
Only me, right?

455
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:51,180
This is the first time you told this to anybody, right,
Kana?

456
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,000
Really?

457
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:58,000
I don't know if I am.

458
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,100
Do you want more of my money?

459
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:04,980
It's only been a little bit since we first met.

460
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:08,780
So I don't know for sure, but I'm just talking about first
impression.

461
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:09,920
Oh my god!

462
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:12,440
I knew it was naturally kind-hearted.

463
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:13,860
I knew it.

464
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:18,220
I do have a feeling you're really kind.

465
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:24,080
My first impressions tend to be accurate, you know?

466
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:25,080
I knew.

467
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:27,280
I bet you I'm the first person to see you said this too.

468
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:28,040
I knew it.

469
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:28,880
I fucking knew it.

470
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:31,000
Your eyes, especially...

471
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:34,100
They seem so gentle.

472
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:37,000
Stare.

473
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:40,900
...

474
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:41,540
...

475
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:42,160
...

476
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:47,760
Hey, it's no fair for you to stare back.

477
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:54,180
I'm gonna get all flustered Can you keep drinking Haiko-Kun?

478
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:56,660
Don't don't push yourself.

479
00:35:57,300 --> 00:36:00,380
Okay, X thank you for the 50 gifted chips.

480

Oh, of course Of course, because my dragoons extended my
time with them, so I will extend my time with you, Kana.

485
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:26,580
Yay, you're gonna stay a bit longer!

486
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:30,180
What drink did you want?

487
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:34,060
Oh, um, I don't know how much money I spent.

488
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:36,940
Don't worry, I'll drink the Ulan highball.

489
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:40,080
Especially selected sochu mixed with Ulan teeny.

490
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:43,680
It's a very easy drink and has a rich flavor and lovely
scent.

491
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,760
Oh, don't worry, don't worry.

492
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:52,220
Okay, I'm a little sort of, um, I'm a little sort of broke
right now.

493
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:55,580
So I hope it's okay that I go 5,000 yen cheaper.

494
00:36:58,580 --> 00:36:59,700
You can change girls.

495
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:01,960
No, I refuse.

496
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:05,500
I refuse to change girls.

497
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:12,320
She is my new Oshi because she showed me just a little bit
of attention and kindness.

498
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:14,020
And now I'm hers forever.

514
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:16,460
Oh.

515
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:22,960
Did you hear that?

516
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:24,200
You heard that, didn't you?

517
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:25,260
Be honest with me.

518
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:26,740
You heard that, right?

519
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:27,760
We heard what?

520
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:31,020
That sounded like it came from your stomach.

521
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:35,720
Oh, so you did hear that.

522
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:39,500
I'm hungry, okay?

523
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:41,600
You can't blame me.

524
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:44,480
Oh my gosh, are they not feeding you here?

525
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,680
Oh, guys, I'm also so hungry.

526
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:52,000
What should I eat when I get home?

527
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:53,440
I wonder.

528
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:58,020
Are you planning on buying something on your way home?

529
00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:00,100
Are you going to cook?

530
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:07,860
What do you think?

531
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:10,460
Why don't we make this a little quiz?

532
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:14,320
How hungry.

533
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:26,020
Do I tend to cook more, or am I the type to resort to buying
pre-made stuff, or do I go out to eat a lot?

534
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:26,560
Oh, God.

535
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:27,740
Okay, this is a bit difficult.

536
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:33,020
My little hint to you is I love eating rice in particular.

537
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:37,940
I could probably just eat white rice for an entire meal.

538
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:39,220
Oh, God.

539
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:39,660
Okay, wait.

540
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:40,200
I'm a woman.

541
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:40,840
I know this.

542
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,240
I feel like that isn't really much of a hint.

543
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:59,380
you're right but come on answer my question okay i think i
should say cook often because like if i say buy pre-made

544
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:09,600
food a lot should just be like what you think i can't cook
for myself so like i'm gonna say cook often good i knew it

545
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:13,660
i'm a woman kind of good work

546
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:28,540
way to do it right thinking as much as you want at home oh
what they were all correct i was just never was gonna okay

547
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:43,820
okay don't take this away from me kana to be honest all of
those options are correct so depending on our mood i'll cook

548
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:54,600
buy food or eat out what's the point of this quiz no no of
course not it was not boring i mean there's no incorrect

What drink did you want?

685
00:50:50,070 --> 00:50:51,750
It's not the same.

686
00:50:56,990 --> 00:50:58,530
Can I have a drink with you?

687
00:50:58,630 --> 00:51:00,790
You don't even bother me up!

688
00:51:01,650 --> 00:51:04,930
Okay, I'll give you... You're gonna have the same drink as

00:51:05,830 --> 00:51:07,410
You have to... You have to earn this.

00:51:07,650 --> 00:51:08,690
You weren't my first.

691
00:51:08,990 --> 00:51:12,310
So you have to try even harder to earn this money.

Wait a second, you're pretty cute, but why are you curled in
a bowser?

695
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:52,200
What's wrong?

696
00:51:52,660 --> 00:51:55,000
Well, I was here for Kana.

697
00:51:55,820 --> 00:51:58,340
You don't even know my name.

698
00:52:01,820 --> 00:52:03,920
You must be nervous.

699
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:05,320
That's no good.

700
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:08,280
Getting nervous over me is just a waste of energy.

701
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:10,480
Oh, hello.

702
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:15,380
My name is Haido Kanda.

703
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:18,560
It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance.

704
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:21,360
That's hilarious.

705
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:23,040
You start introducing yourself.

706
00:52:23,380 --> 00:52:25,820
No, she's making fun of me.

707
00:52:27,740 --> 00:52:28,640
Well then.

708
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:30,280
I will too.

709
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:32,460
Hello, I'm Rin.

710
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:34,880
I'm sorry to trouble you.

711
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:36,060
What am I doing?

712
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:37,500
Is this how it's supposed to go?

713
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:40,420
She's laughing at me, guys.

714
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:45,500
She makes me...

715
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:48,020
I feel emasculated.

716
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:51,520
So what do you do, Hi-chan?

717
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:54,260
But she called me Hi-chan, so it's all better now.

718
00:52:56,520 --> 00:53:01,760
Well, right now, I'm assisting an acquaintance with their
job.

719
00:53:03,620 --> 00:53:06,840
But until recently, I was employed at her company.

720
00:53:08,300 --> 00:53:08,980
However...

721
00:53:08,980 --> 00:53:11,240
How abusive.

722
00:53:11,540 --> 00:53:13,020
Keep doing it.

723
00:53:13,180 --> 00:53:13,840
Pyro!

724
00:53:17,820 --> 00:53:21,500
That was due to plethora of mistakes, I was terminated.

725
00:53:23,340 --> 00:53:23,920
Hang on.

726
00:53:25,700 --> 00:53:28,600
Hai-chan, I can't keep up with all that formal speech.

727
00:53:29,180 --> 00:53:32,360
I'd be super grateful if you just talk normally.

728
00:53:34,040 --> 00:53:35,600
Hannah wouldn't laugh at me.

729
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:36,920
Really?

730
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:39,700
I'll drop the pretences then.

731
00:53:40,780 --> 00:53:41,240
Thank you.

732
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:46,320
Thank yous.

733
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:48,040
You're such a nice guy, Haichan.

734
00:53:48,740 --> 00:53:50,180
It's their loss for firing you.

735
00:53:50,380 --> 00:53:51,680
You're better off without them.

736
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:53,440
You are right, Rin.

737
00:53:53,900 --> 00:53:55,840
They made a fucking mistake.

738
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:58,400
No, oh, okay, never mind.

739
00:53:58,520 --> 00:53:58,980
She's not right.

740
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:00,860
No, they treated me pretty well.

741
00:54:01,300 --> 00:54:03,180
I'm getting by okay now.

742
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:12,940
Wow, you're really something, Haichan.

743
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:17,700
I respect that.

744
00:54:23,020 --> 00:54:24,780
You're a stand-up guy.

745
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:26,580
You must get that a lot, huh?

746
00:54:27,340 --> 00:54:27,600
Oh.

747
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:30,800
Let me hear some more.

748
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:35,140
I don't get that at all.

749
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:37,080
My self-esteem is so bad.

750
00:54:37,460 --> 00:54:39,580
Why don't you help me out?

751
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:47,240
There it is again.

752
00:54:48,260 --> 00:54:49,420
What's the name for it?

753
00:54:50,740 --> 00:54:51,380
Humanity?

754
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:55,540
Oh, what was it?

755
00:54:55,540 --> 00:54:56,420
It starts with age.

756
00:54:56,740 --> 00:54:57,100
Humility!

757
00:54:57,600 --> 00:54:58,120
That's it!

758
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:08,120
Oh, hey, let me tell you something.

759
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:09,240
I'm serious.

760
00:55:09,620 --> 00:55:10,900
Well, I'm always serious.

761
00:55:11,180 --> 00:55:12,660
But now I'm seriously serious.

762
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:24,260
Me and you people is really important, right?

763
00:55:24,540 --> 00:55:27,960
In life, I mean, so I'm really grateful to have met you,
Hai-chan.

764
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:41,060
I may be far from perfect, but I'll still do the very best I
can.

765
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:42,320
I hope you're ready.

766
00:55:46,990 --> 00:55:47,230
What?

767
00:55:47,570 --> 00:55:47,570
God!

768
00:55:55,220 --> 00:55:56,180
I'm embarrassing.

769
00:55:56,740 --> 00:55:58,120
What am I saying?

770
00:55:58,300 --> 00:55:59,280
I'm so silly.

771
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:01,660
Well, you get the idea.

772
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:03,460
Did you catch all that?

773
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:05,320

00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:17,100

from the very beginning i swear i mean you're an important
Of course I knew you wouldn't remember it, Kana.

847
01:02:21,290 --> 01:02:22,050
I knew it.

848
01:02:22,350 --> 01:02:23,130
I knew it.

849
01:02:23,310 --> 01:02:25,450
I almost believed the haters out there.

850
01:02:25,810 --> 01:02:30,990
But my dedication to you would never unwaver, Kana.

851
01:02:31,410 --> 01:02:37,590
Even if your name slipped my mind, I remember it instantly.

852
01:02:40,730 --> 01:02:43,190
Because you're Haito-Kun, and I know you are.

853
01:02:43,810 --> 01:02:45,290
You're Haito-Kun, right?

854
01:02:45,490 --> 01:02:46,890
Yes, I'm Haito-Kun.

855
01:02:48,030 --> 01:02:49,010
I am...

856
01:02:49,010 --> 01:02:50,670
Actually, I'm kind...

857
01:02:50,670 --> 01:02:51,610
I am Haito.

858
01:02:52,810 --> 01:02:53,750
I am Haito!

859
01:02:54,590 --> 01:02:55,130
See?

860
01:02:55,470 --> 01:03:00,210
I told you I'll get your name.

861
01:03:01,930 --> 01:03:03,510
There's no way I'd forget it.

862
01:03:04,070 --> 01:03:05,050
That was a relief.

863
01:03:05,590 --> 01:03:06,630
JP, thank you for the super chat.

864
01:03:06,750 --> 01:03:07,350
Thank you.

865
01:03:07,350 --> 01:03:07,830
Thank you.

866
01:03:08,070 --> 01:03:08,610
No!

867
01:03:08,730 --> 01:03:12,330
She was playing a funny joke on me and it was so funny.

868
01:03:15,790 --> 01:03:17,690
Anyways, don't worry about me.

869
01:03:18,030 --> 01:03:20,810
I'll never forget your name anymore, so don't worry, okay?

870
01:03:21,470 --> 01:03:24,070
Of course, I'd never doubted you for the second, Kana.

871
01:03:24,910 --> 01:03:28,530
Thanks, but I'm sure it's really hard for you to remember
every customer's name like that.

872
01:03:28,650 --> 01:03:29,370
Exactly, guys.

873
01:03:29,670 --> 01:03:32,030
She's a very busy girl, chat.

874
01:03:32,670 --> 01:03:36,370
Like, she can't just remember all our names, you know?

875
01:03:36,790 --> 01:03:38,390
Like, she's so busy.

876
01:03:38,650 --> 01:03:42,530
This is her job, and it's okay if she makes a mistake or
two.

877
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:50,460
Yeah, I wish you all had name tags on or something, you
know?

878
01:03:52,020 --> 01:03:53,320
That's something cute.

879
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:55,860
Like what you see a kindergartener wearing.

880
01:03:56,240 --> 01:03:57,840
I know, Kat, you're so right.

881
01:03:58,120 --> 01:04:00,660
It's our fault that you can't remember our names.

882
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:03,660
And I take full responsibility, Kana.

883
01:04:05,680 --> 01:04:07,820
I'm only joking, of course.

884
01:04:08,140 --> 01:04:09,700
I'm a pro in my field.

885
01:04:12,440 --> 01:04:14,840
Remembering names is my specialty.

886
01:04:15,820 --> 01:04:18,140
Well, you did remember my name within seconds before.

887
01:04:18,740 --> 01:04:20,760
Seems like you're doing great from my eyes.

888
01:04:23,140 --> 01:04:34,400

they don't even tell you how much money you spend.

896
01:05:55,540 --> 01:05:57,440
What do you like to eat?

897
01:05:58,700 --> 01:06:01,300
I don't know if I have any particular favorites.

898
01:06:01,820 --> 01:06:04,480
In fact, I'm really picky and I'll eat almost anything.

899
01:06:04,900 --> 01:06:10,020
It's why I've been eating every day at the convenience store
so I can save my money for you, Kana.

900
01:06:12,080 --> 01:06:13,920
You're seriously not picky at all?

901
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:28,780
Anything for you so you'd eat up sticks and stones if i
bring them to you that's amazing you might even go viral if

902
01:06:28,780 --> 01:06:36,980

chan

904
01:06:47,260 --> 01:06:54,760
wait are you setting me up to make my food preferences into
a little quiz You know, I was just genuinely curious, but I

905
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:56,920
guess we could make it into a little game if you like.

906
01:07:01,960 --> 01:07:02,760
Sounds great.

907
01:07:03,060 --> 01:07:04,180
You know I love quizzes.

908
01:07:04,780 --> 01:07:06,520
So what do you think my favorite food is?

909
01:07:10,040 --> 01:07:10,440
Guys.

910
01:07:12,580 --> 01:07:14,460
Is this going to be a trick question again?

911
01:07:15,620 --> 01:07:17,360
Mr. Tooth, thank you for the super chat.

912
01:07:17,620 --> 01:07:17,760
Thank you.

913
01:07:17,820 --> 01:07:18,240
Thank you.

914
01:07:18,540 --> 01:07:19,520
Lucky for us, Doki.

915
01:07:19,720 --> 01:07:20,640
We'll never forget our names.

916
01:07:20,780 --> 01:07:23,220
After all, we have the name tags.

917
01:07:23,640 --> 01:07:25,820
Told you it was a brilliant idea.

918
01:07:26,120 --> 01:07:27,420
Thank you for the super chat.

919
01:07:27,680 --> 01:07:27,780
Thank you.

920
01:07:28,140 --> 01:07:28,420
Thank you.

921
01:07:31,520 --> 01:07:32,000
Sushi?

922
01:07:32,760 --> 01:07:34,140
Oh, because she likes rice.

923
01:07:34,500 --> 01:07:35,440
You're right, guys.

924
01:07:35,620 --> 01:07:36,060
Our girl.

925
01:07:36,260 --> 01:07:36,900
This is our girl.

926
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:37,740
We work together.

927
01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:40,520
How about sushi?

928
01:07:42,700 --> 01:07:49,120
When I go to sushi trains, I always end up making a tower of
empty plates.

929
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:50,440
I love sushi.

930
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:52,900
I can't stop eating it once I start.

931
01:07:56,920 --> 01:08:00,260
I'm so hungry now that I started thinking about food.

932
01:08:00,740 --> 01:08:02,060
Kana, do you want food, Kana?

933
01:08:05,380 --> 01:08:08,280
Heyto, say something that would distract me, please.

934
01:08:12,360 --> 01:08:15,740
At this rate, my head is going to end up being filled with
thoughts of food.

935
01:08:16,360 --> 01:08:19,400
And I won't be able to concentrate on getting to know you.

936
01:08:19,500 --> 01:08:21,640
Oh, do you want food?

937
01:08:23,840 --> 01:08:24,480
Hmm?

938
01:08:26,080 --> 01:08:29,420
Million stars shining in our solar system?

939
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:32,080
Stars?

940
01:08:32,760 --> 01:08:33,260
Make a...

941
01:08:33,260 --> 01:08:33,980
What?

942
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:35,520
Make a...

943
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:36,040
Michelin?

944
01:08:36,220 --> 01:08:37,160
Oh, Michelin stars!

945
01:08:37,840 --> 01:08:38,740
It's like...

946
01:08:38,740 --> 01:08:39,360
Kelvin?

947
01:08:40,040 --> 01:08:40,840
Michelin stars!

948
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:43,220
No, I can't take my mind off food!

949
01:08:44,700 --> 01:08:46,320
How about history then?

950
01:08:46,460 --> 01:08:48,960
You know, famous Japanese battles?

951
01:08:50,300 --> 01:08:53,500
I'm just sure that won't lead back to food.

952
01:09:02,240 --> 01:09:14,700
how does she know about michelin stars oh no oh no she has
high taste guys history ancient times the edo period and

953
01:09:14,700 --> 01:09:23,460

say right now is just going to lead back to food somehow

954
01:09:27,260 --> 01:09:29,140
Guys, do I have 3,000 yen?

955
01:09:31,460 --> 01:09:33,480
Should I get you more drinks?

956
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:36,560
I can keep going, but only continue if I want to.

957
01:09:36,840 --> 01:09:38,920
Guys, do I have 3,000 yen?

958
01:09:39,240 --> 01:09:40,460
This is important.

959
01:09:43,480 --> 01:09:44,040
No.

960
01:09:44,520 --> 01:09:46,400
I'm sorry, Kana.

961
01:09:47,180 --> 01:09:49,380
I'm broke for the day.

962
01:09:53,800 --> 01:09:55,040
I'm sorry.

963
01:09:55,700 --> 01:09:56,980
It's getting late.

I should go home soon.

965
01:09:59,700 --> 01:10:02,620
But don't worry, I'll be back with more money.

966

Doki, the slots call you.

1015
01:13:43,700 --> 01:13:44,160
Keep going.

1016
01:13:44,260 --> 01:13:44,920
Kana can wait.

1017
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:46,100
The lights are calling.

1018
01:13:46,360 --> 01:13:46,520
D.

1019
01:13:48,580 --> 01:13:52,040
One person is only here for this game for the gambling.

1020
01:13:52,720 --> 01:14:03,900
Not for not for the main gameplay here Kana, Kana, I got
you, I got you some, a diamond necklace!

1021
01:14:03,900 --> 01:14:05,400
A diamond necklace?

1022
01:14:08,900 --> 01:14:09,580
Okay.

1023
01:14:11,100 --> 01:14:14,780
I did not realize I bought a diamond necklace.

1024
01:14:15,660 --> 01:14:15,900
Okay.

1025
01:14:16,540 --> 01:14:19,320
If it's okay, would you be willing to accept this?

1026
01:14:19,760 --> 01:14:21,500
I hope you like it.

1027
01:14:21,520 --> 01:14:21,800
I didn't.

1028
01:14:22,280 --> 01:14:22,580
I didn't.

1029
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:24,480
Can I really have it?

1030
01:14:25,900 --> 01:14:26,960
I'm so happy.

1031
01:14:27,460 --> 01:14:27,840
Thank you.

1032
01:14:27,960 --> 01:14:29,200
Of course you are, Kana.

1033
01:14:31,180 --> 01:14:33,200
We have to take care of it.

1034
01:14:35,800 --> 01:14:37,060
You seem happy.

1035
01:14:37,280 --> 01:14:38,300
Did something happen?

1036
01:14:42,700 --> 01:14:45,860
You came all this way to visit me, Haito-kun.

1037
01:14:46,520 --> 01:14:47,640
Of course I'm happy.

1038
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:49,240
Of course, Kana.

1039
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:51,820
I don't care about all these other ladies.

1040
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:53,840
My eyes are only for you.

1041
01:14:55,200 --> 01:14:55,760
Thanks.

1042
01:14:55,900 --> 01:14:58,240
But, you see, much happier than usual.

1043
01:15:05,160 --> 01:15:08,860
Maybe it's because I already got some time to relax during
my time off recently.

1044
01:15:09,620 --> 01:15:11,180
Lloyd Kurosus, thank you for the super chat.

1045
01:15:11,340 --> 01:15:12,100
Thank you, thank you.

1046
01:15:12,360 --> 01:15:18,340
That weird feeling when your Oshi is losing tons of money to
a pretty girl when she doesn't have a huge amount of money

1047
01:15:18,340 --> 01:15:19,780
to spare right now.

1048
01:15:19,940 --> 01:15:21,180
Couldn't be me.

1049
01:15:21,640 --> 01:15:22,980
Thank you for the super chat.

1050
01:15:23,260 --> 01:15:24,160
Thank you, thank you.

1051
01:15:24,460 --> 01:15:26,840
Because your day is off to the fullest then.

1052
01:15:29,940 --> 01:15:38,660
um oh um guys okay

1053
01:15:42,120 --> 01:15:48,680

1054
01:15:52,620 --> 01:15:57,860

1055
01:16:06,360 --> 01:16:14,940
Sleptin Sleptin I assume Oh I fucking knew it No Nicholas

1056
01:16:22,640 --> 01:16:31,820
You can't look at me like that It feels amazing to sleep
Without worrying about alarm The sleeping throughout the

1057
01:16:31,820 --> 01:16:40,760
whole day Feels like a bit of a waste You're too young You
don't understand the older you get sleeping in is a fucking

1058
01:16:40,760 --> 01:16:54,160
luxury I played with my bro There was no dog in this quiz,
but it's not your fault, Kana It's not your fault.

1059
01:16:54,200 --> 01:16:55,400
It had to be my fault.

1060
01:16:55,700 --> 01:17:07,640
I could have asked about the dog I played with my dog for
the whole day last time I had a day off Oh, you have a dog?

1061
01:17:10,220 --> 01:17:11,260
Uh-huh.

1062
01:17:12,240 --> 01:17:14,120
Oh, she has a chihuahua.

1063
01:17:15,320 --> 01:17:17,700
Not that I'll judge or anything.

1064
01:17:20,200 --> 01:17:22,980
He's a chihuahua called Wawa.

1065
01:17:23,380 --> 01:17:24,460
He's super cute.

1066
01:17:32,460 --> 01:17:37,120
And when you call him Wawa-chin, He wags his tail and comes
to you.

1067
01:17:37,180 --> 01:17:39,300
When he sleeps, it's always next to me, too.

1068
01:17:40,100 --> 01:17:42,500
Bro, like, I was just set up for failure.

1069
01:17:56,240 --> 01:17:57,660
He loves walks, too.

1070
01:17:57,780 --> 01:18:03,060
So I take him to this really big park near my place whenever
I get a day off.

1071
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:05,800
That's what we did last time, too.

1072
01:18:07,900 --> 01:18:08,900
That sounds great.

1073
01:18:09,060 --> 01:18:10,440
I love dogs, too.

1074
01:18:12,080 --> 01:18:12,580
Really?

1075
01:18:17,390 --> 01:18:21,810
Well, I hope you give Wawa Chin a nice pat if you ever come
around.

1076
01:18:24,130 --> 01:18:26,590
I'm sure you'll end up enjoying his company, too.

1077
01:18:28,990 --> 01:18:30,650
Do you think he'd be fine around me, though?

1078
01:18:30,970 --> 01:18:31,590
I don't think so.

1079
01:18:31,670 --> 01:18:32,310
It's Chihuahua.

1080
01:18:32,490 --> 01:18:34,750
Chihuahua hate everybody, but they're owners.

1081
01:18:35,790 --> 01:18:38,450
I wonder who think I'm trying to take his master away from
him.

1082
01:18:44,720 --> 01:18:45,520
Who knows?

1083
01:18:45,660 --> 01:18:46,540
That could happen.

1084
01:18:46,780 --> 01:18:50,180
Wawa-chin loves me so much after all.

1085
01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:51,720
It should have been me.

1086
01:18:51,980 --> 01:18:53,260
It should have been me.

1087
01:18:55,380 --> 01:18:56,880
You're trying to steal me away.

1088
01:18:58,060 --> 01:19:06,020
Oh, I didn't mean like, like, like that, Connor, but, but,
but, but, if that's what you, what you want.

1089
01:19:09,160 --> 01:19:10,200
What's wrong?

1090
01:19:19,570 --> 01:19:20,710
Nothing at all.

1091
01:19:20,770 --> 01:19:22,270
I'm feeling a little sweaty right now.

1092
01:19:22,590 --> 01:19:29,330
Actually, I wonder what's wrong with me Guys, do I have
enough guys?

1093
01:19:31,150 --> 01:19:34,190
Guys, guys, how much money do I have?

1094
01:19:34,630 --> 01:19:35,290
I don't.

1095
01:19:35,330 --> 01:19:36,030
I spent it.

1096
01:19:36,410 --> 01:19:36,950
No.

1097
01:19:39,570 --> 01:19:42,570
I don't have enough money.

1098
01:19:43,050 --> 01:19:44,030
I'm sorry.

1099
01:19:44,630 --> 01:19:47,330
I just have one session.

1100
01:19:48,310 --> 01:19:48,710
Okay, good.

1101
01:19:52,910 --> 01:19:56,650
Okay, but like, being in debt for a little bit will be okay.

1102
01:19:57,190 --> 01:19:57,750
It's okay.

1103
01:19:58,710 --> 01:20:00,010
I'm good for it.

1104
01:20:00,170 --> 01:20:01,010
I'm good for it.

1105
01:20:01,710 --> 01:20:02,730
I'm gonna stay a little bit longer.

1106
01:20:03,350 --> 01:20:05,610
It's just a little bit in the red.

1107
01:20:05,710 --> 01:20:06,490
I'm good for it.

1108
01:20:06,850 --> 01:20:07,250
They'll know.

1109
01:20:07,390 --> 01:20:08,310
I can pay them back.

1110
01:20:10,330 --> 01:20:10,830
What drink do you want?

1111
01:20:10,890 --> 01:20:12,150
I'll take the orange.

1112
01:20:13,590 --> 01:20:14,850
Oh, of course, Kana.

1113
01:20:15,230 --> 01:20:18,030
And then you can have, you can have the vintage.

1114
01:20:18,150 --> 01:20:20,790
It's okay just it's just a little bit in the red guys.

1115
01:20:21,290 --> 01:20:28,590
It's just a little bit They know I'm good for the money And
I don't need guys.

1116
01:20:28,830 --> 01:20:30,350
I have two kidneys.

1117
01:20:31,010 --> 01:20:31,760
That's all I'm saying

1118
01:20:34,950 --> 01:20:43,130
Guys I have two Let's see here you had soy ramen for lunch

01:20:45,290 --> 01:20:50,650
Oh, no, I didn't I actually did, but I'm just playing with
her.

1121
01:20:56,030 --> 01:20:57,070
Forget that.

1122
01:20:59,610 --> 01:21:01,890
My vision wasn't fully accurate.

1123
01:21:02,270 --> 01:21:04,250
Of course you ate rice for lunch, didn't you?

1124
01:21:05,110 --> 01:21:09,750
I mean, I did, but I feel like rice is cheating when it's
used in some...

1125
01:21:09,750 --> 01:21:11,650
Haito, shut the fuck up, Haito.

1126
01:21:13,250 --> 01:21:15,510
We're supposed to agree with her.

Right, but you don't have any psychic powers, right?

1136
01:22:24,190 --> 01:22:25,250
I mean, clearly you don't.

1137
01:22:25,330 --> 01:22:26,750
Well, you couldn't predict what I ate.

1138
01:22:27,330 --> 01:22:28,710
Kaz, thank you for the super chat.

1139
01:22:29,070 --> 01:22:30,030
Thank you, thank you.

1140
01:22:30,490 --> 01:22:31,330
Two kidneys?

1141
01:22:31,730 --> 01:22:32,070
You're right.

1142
01:22:32,330 --> 01:22:35,510
Imagine how many super chats I can send with that.

1143
01:22:35,870 --> 01:22:36,790
Thank you for the super chat.

1144
01:22:37,010 --> 01:22:37,830
Thank you, thank you.

1145
01:22:38,730 --> 01:22:41,810
Hey, I might be a late bloomer with my powers.

1146
01:22:43,570 --> 01:22:47,570
Why don't you think about all this after those powers bloom
then?

1147
01:22:50,750 --> 01:22:52,630
Guys, nobody's perfect!

1148
01:22:55,270 --> 01:22:59,830
But what would I do if someone asks if I have a party trick
then?

1149
01:23:00,510 --> 01:23:03,250
It's up to us to accept those flaws!

1150
01:23:04,530 --> 01:23:05,570
Except for me, I'm perfect.

1151
01:23:08,330 --> 01:23:11,350
Are you saying there isn't something you're super good at?

1152
01:23:15,170 --> 01:23:16,410
I mean...

1153
01:23:18,230 --> 01:23:27,570
There's nothing I can think of Where I'm better than the
average person I like acting and stuff But I'm not that good

1154
01:23:27,570 --> 01:23:29,650
Guys, why don't we even play Twisters?

1155
01:23:31,290 --> 01:23:37,510
It's not because Guys, I'm just Not because like This is
what I'm looking for But like I heard that there's Twister

1156
01:23:37,510 --> 01:23:46,770
And like, you know, it's a fun game Is there anything you
notice When looking at me, Haito-Kun?

1157
01:23:48,230 --> 01:23:50,190
for a really cool skill.

1158
01:23:50,390 --> 01:23:53,190
Guys, I just want to win, okay?

1159
01:23:53,310 --> 01:23:54,550
And I want to win at Twisters.

1160
01:23:54,830 --> 01:23:56,370
That's really it.

1161
01:24:02,650 --> 01:24:03,370
Let's see.

1162
01:24:03,470 --> 01:24:05,950
Well, you're very good at making people smile.

1163
01:24:06,710 --> 01:24:08,650
I'd call that a skill, Kana-chan.

1164
01:24:11,550 --> 01:24:14,570
Every time I see you, I get all happy, you know?

1165
01:24:20,110 --> 01:24:23,190
I'm guessing that's not what you wanted to hear at all.

1166
01:24:34,090 --> 01:24:37,530
No, that's exactly what I wanted to hear.

1167
01:24:37,890 --> 01:24:42,250
I just, I don't know what to say back to something like
that.

1168
01:24:52,950 --> 01:24:55,190
What do I do with you, Haito-Kun?

1169
01:24:55,570 --> 01:24:56,890
You're always like this.

1170
01:24:57,350 --> 01:24:59,630
You compliment me when I least expect.

1171
01:25:00,050 --> 01:25:02,070
I'm going to have a heart attack.

1172
01:25:03,070 --> 01:25:05,630
Sorry, I didn't say whatever is on my mind.

1173
01:25:06,050 --> 01:25:09,650
I'll try and stop myself from saying stuff like that from
now on.

1174
01:25:12,370 --> 01:25:13,070
That's right.

1175
01:25:13,390 --> 01:25:15,330
Always compliment the ladies.

1176
01:25:17,390 --> 01:25:18,490
That's even worse.

1177
01:25:19,150 --> 01:25:21,410
I'd love to hear you compliment me.

1178
01:25:27,770 --> 01:25:30,510
I'll make sure to live up to your standards too.

1179
01:25:30,950 --> 01:25:32,930
Like, I'll do my best to make you happy.

1180
01:25:33,530 --> 01:25:35,110
She just wants to make me happy.

1181
01:25:35,450 --> 01:25:36,750
It's not about the money.

1182
01:25:36,870 --> 01:25:37,790
I fucking knew.

1183
01:25:37,810 --> 01:25:38,870
I knew it, guys.

1184
01:25:39,250 --> 01:25:42,510
You guys were telling me to stay away from Kana.

1185
01:25:42,670 --> 01:25:44,550
That she is going to take advantage.

1186
01:25:44,850 --> 01:25:48,410
But she literally told me it's not about the money.

1187
01:25:49,130 --> 01:25:50,350
She's here for me.

1188
01:25:52,630 --> 01:25:53,830

1189
01:25:54,590 --> 01:26:06,870

01:26:12,930 --> 01:26:16,250

01:28:28,680 --> 01:28:28,980
you.

1213
01:28:39,330 --> 01:28:40,850
You're totally right.

1214
01:28:41,690 --> 01:28:44,030
Wawa-chin really does boost my morale.

1215
01:28:44,610 --> 01:28:48,990
He's the main reason why I could do be my best ever since I
moved here.

1216
01:28:55,570 --> 01:29:05,710
And because he makes me so happy I need to do my part And

Okay I feel like you've already done that for him.

1220
01:29:28,500 --> 01:29:30,140
Okay, this has to be the right answer.

1221
01:29:31,380 --> 01:29:34,200
You know, I feel like you've already done that for him.

1222
01:29:36,560 --> 01:29:38,300
I hope he sees it that way.

1223
01:29:40,440 --> 01:29:43,180
I'll do my best to pamper him when I get home tonight, too.

1287
01:33:18,860 --> 01:33:21,320
If you job hunt, you can make more money.

1288
01:33:22,140 --> 01:33:23,220
Oh, it's cute.

1289

01:33:27,680 --> 01:33:28,640

01:33:28,660 --> 01:33:29,200
Stop.

1292
01:33:29,580 --> 01:33:31,520

1294
01:33:33,080 --> 01:33:37,120

01:33:41,500 --> 01:33:42,540
You like macarons.

1298
01:33:42,960 --> 01:33:46,600
Will you be willing to accept this?

1299
01:33:46,720 --> 01:33:48,000
I hope you like it.

1300
01:33:48,240 --> 01:33:49,320
She does!

1301
01:33:50,140 --> 01:33:52,680
Guys, I have a feeling she just likes everything I give her.

1302
01:33:53,760 --> 01:33:55,200
I'll take care of it.

1303
01:33:56,940 --> 01:33:58,640
I've been really forgetful recently.

1304
01:33:59,220 --> 01:34:05,040
I saved a shopping list on my phone the other day too But I
completely forgot that I even made it when I got to the

1305
01:34:05,040 --> 01:34:14,320
store I always forget things when I'm tired too Santino they
give this super chat thank you thank you Use this for your

1306
01:34:14,320 --> 01:34:21,280
next gambling session Lord Kurosus this woman thinks we're
waiting wanting her When we really just want to pet the dog

1307
01:34:21,280 --> 01:34:26,980
until it loves us more than her They give this super chat
thank you thank you Look I would agree with that but she

1308
01:34:26,980 --> 01:34:33,760
owns a chihuahua And I look it's not that I don't like
chihuahuas, but all I'm saying is that I feel like out of

1309
01:34:33,760 --> 01:34:41,500
all the dogs in the world If if there was one dog that think
is like, you know, the personification of of the devil

1310
01:34:44,620 --> 01:34:55,700
If the devil was real, I think it would be the chihuahua The
other day I was planning on only having one bowl of rice

1311
01:34:55,700 --> 01:35:06,140
since I've been dining I'm it I've had three I feel like
that has nothing to do with forgetfulness You just gave into

1312
01:35:06,140 --> 01:35:07,500
your cravings

1313
01:35:12,380 --> 01:35:18,400
Like she's almost perfect Except for the fact that she
thinks she's psychic And also that she could be an astrology

1314
01:35:18,400 --> 01:35:28,320
girl And also like she owns a chihuahua She's like perfect
That's not true I just forget about the whole rule I set

1315
01:35:28,320 --> 01:35:29,280
myself when dieting

1316
01:35:34,120 --> 01:35:36,480
Oh, why don't I give you a quiz

1317
01:35:39,740 --> 01:35:45,720
So that you won't forget as much You know, using your brain
Leads to increase the memorization That's why I'm getting

1318
01:35:52,100 --> 01:35:54,400
What was I doing during my day off?

1319
01:35:55,540 --> 01:35:57,200

Exactly, guys.

1324
01:36:07,540 --> 01:36:08,720
Women don't like it.

1325
01:36:09,100 --> 01:36:13,080
She went for a walk at the park with her dog.

1326
01:36:13,400 --> 01:36:13,680
There you go.

1327
01:36:13,740 --> 01:36:16,740
She went for a walk at the park.

1328
01:36:17,480 --> 01:36:18,120

1345
01:36:59,300 --> 01:37:00,260
to what I told you.

1346
01:37:00,420 --> 01:37:01,600
I like how you're so attached.

1347
01:37:01,860 --> 01:37:03,220
I know, of course.

1348
01:37:03,940 --> 01:37:04,540
Kana, of course.

1349
01:37:04,720 --> 01:37:06,140
I remember everything you say.

1350
01:37:13,310 --> 01:37:15,830
I need to be careful about being forgetful too.

1351
01:37:16,050 --> 01:37:18,110
Or else I'll never be able to go through a dieting.

1352
01:37:21,990 --> 01:37:24,870
I keep saying, that has nothing to do with memorization.

1353
01:37:25,590 --> 01:37:27,710
I think it's your willpower that you need to work on.

1354
01:37:27,990 --> 01:37:28,930
I don't know!

1355
01:37:29,370 --> 01:37:31,630
This is not how you fucking get the ladies!

1356
01:37:32,190 --> 01:37:40,950
You'd never criticize them especially about dieting kata's
just like let me ignore that because i want you to spend

1357
01:37:40,950 --> 01:37:49,690
more money should i get you more drinks i can keep going but
only continue if you want to yes i have the money this time

1358
01:37:52,690 --> 01:37:58,010
thank you i thought you're going of course i would never go
home i'll fucking max it out for you what drink i'll just

1359
01:37:58,010 --> 01:38:04,710
let me keep you know what i feel a little adventurous i feel
I feel so adventurous right now.

1360
01:38:04,730 --> 01:38:06,250
I'll spend 100 yen more.

1361
01:38:07,950 --> 01:38:10,350
And then for you, my queen, I'm going to...

1362
01:38:10,350 --> 01:38:10,770
You know what?

1363
01:38:10,790 --> 01:38:11,490
I'm going to...

1364
01:38:11,490 --> 01:38:14,550
I'm going to give you the fine wine.

1365
01:38:20,310 --> 01:38:21,690
Yep, yep, it tastes great.

1366
01:38:22,230 --> 01:38:23,570
Anyway, yep, yep, it tastes great.

1367
01:38:23,930 --> 01:38:25,910
Wait, it just tastes great?

1368
01:38:27,530 --> 01:38:28,490
It's just...

1369
01:38:28,490 --> 01:38:30,010
It's just great?

1370
01:38:31,310 --> 01:38:31,790
Wait.

1371
01:38:32,050 --> 01:38:34,790
No, I pressed Q instead of E.

1372
01:38:40,390 --> 01:38:41,470
I keep forgetting.

1373
01:38:41,570 --> 01:38:42,410
I keep...

1374
01:38:42,410 --> 01:38:43,830
I don't know how to read.

1375
01:38:45,090 --> 01:38:46,930
I saw Zoom.

1376
01:38:47,590 --> 01:38:49,610
I didn't see it Zoom out.

1377
01:38:54,150 --> 01:38:55,690
Q was Zoom out.

1378
01:38:56,130 --> 01:38:57,290
E was Zoom in.

1379
01:38:57,610 --> 01:38:59,110
But I didn't read it fully.

1380
01:38:59,230 --> 01:39:00,470
I just saw Zoom.

1381
01:39:05,910 --> 01:39:09,490
I had a nightmare for the first time and forever last night.

1382
01:39:09,830 --> 01:39:12,310
I woke up screaming in the middle of the night.

1383
01:39:14,690 --> 01:39:15,750
Oh, seriously?

1384
01:39:15,970 --> 01:39:17,450
What kind of dream was it?

1385
01:39:17,830 --> 01:39:19,770
That you weren't there, baby girl.

1386
01:39:20,090 --> 01:39:20,470
Whoa.

1387
01:39:21,630 --> 01:39:23,750
Well, I had become a kid.

1388
01:39:23,890 --> 01:39:25,590
And I was enjoying my summer vacation.

1389
01:39:26,970 --> 01:39:29,910
You know, catching bugs and swimming in the river.

1390
01:39:30,450 --> 01:39:34,290
Kind of like when I went to my grandma's place to spend the
summer

1391
01:39:41,410 --> 01:39:52,150
wait who did the throw up emote oh lord you don't understand
this is why you don't have kana wait what about this is that

1392
01:39:52,150 --> 01:40:01,230
is a nightmare I mean that sounds pretty fun to me right I
thought so too in the beginning but then the moment said I

1393
01:40:01,230 --> 01:40:12,990
wish my summer vacation will go on forever and that forever
didn't include you boom oh wait a giant version of my boss

1394
01:40:12,990 --> 01:40:24,390
crawled out of the soil and said i'll give you a vacation
for the rest of their life you're fired i like someone

1395
01:40:24,390 --> 01:40:30,370
pregnant emoji right anyone would wake up screaming after
that

1396
01:40:34,090 --> 01:40:38,150
out but i guess me getting fired really got me emotionally

1397
01:40:42,290 --> 01:40:52,090
you're not to blame though i mean sure you were genuinely
shocked it takes time for emotional wounds to heal you're so

1398
01:40:52,090 --> 01:40:57,990
right kana uh free thank you for the super chat thank you
thank you bunny girls i enjoyed your company sir credit card

1399
01:40:57,990 --> 01:41:03,870
declines bunny girls low tier god lighting appears around
them You should...

1400
01:41:06,990 --> 01:41:11,050
I know that, but I just want to forget it.

1401
01:41:17,110 --> 01:41:18,750
How about this?

1402
01:41:19,610 --> 01:41:22,190
I'll make you forget those bad memories!

1403
01:41:24,810 --> 01:41:26,750
Are you saying you're going to cheer me up somehow?

1404
01:41:27,210 --> 01:41:29,790
You really are kind to the core, Hana.

1405
01:41:35,130 --> 01:41:36,610
A special drink?

1406
01:41:37,370 --> 01:41:40,070
It'll only cost you, like, the rest of your money.

1407
01:41:40,830 --> 01:41:43,750
I think there's a special drink we hid away in the shop's
storage.

1408
01:41:44,230 --> 01:41:45,210
I'm sure you take a sip.

1409
01:41:45,290 --> 01:41:47,990
Your memory will fade away in an instant.

1410
01:41:49,110 --> 01:41:52,650
I prefer not to forget with something like that.

1411
01:41:56,050 --> 01:42:00,070
Of course, I just need more time with you, so you'll get me
the special drink, right?

1412
01:42:00,470 --> 01:42:01,190
Right, Hakana?

1413
01:42:01,670 --> 01:42:02,330
Is that it?

1414
01:42:09,710 --> 01:42:11,890
I'll take the orange juice.

1415
01:42:13,410 --> 01:42:14,210
Of course, of course.

1416
01:42:14,330 --> 01:42:18,450
And you can get the vintage Umashu because I know that's
what you love.

1417
01:42:19,650 --> 01:42:21,310
Yep, yep, it tastes great.

1418
01:42:22,370 --> 01:42:23,270
No, I keep...

1419
01:42:23,270 --> 01:42:25,210
Guys, I need to buy new drinks.

1420
01:42:25,450 --> 01:42:27,970
She's already too used to the Umashu.

1421
01:42:32,720 --> 01:42:34,520
We're looking respectfully.

1422
01:42:42,800 --> 01:42:52,660
conversation what if like i buy food this time well buying
food like increase it okay why do you want to share a pizza

1423
01:42:52,660 --> 01:43:03,280
with me with me conna we can share pizza together oh this is
great i love this

1424
01:43:12,830 --> 01:43:15,030
That's so much going on today That was...

1425
01:43:15,030 --> 01:43:16,690
Oh my god, you're right, I should have got sushi!

1426
01:43:16,890 --> 01:43:17,510
It's our favorite!

1427
01:43:18,250 --> 01:43:19,290
You're so right!

1428
01:43:20,090 --> 01:43:22,270
Oh my god, this is why this is a group effort.

1429
01:43:22,910 --> 01:43:28,510
If all of us work together, if all the dragoons work
together, we surely might score one kana.

1430
01:43:29,470 --> 01:43:32,730
You took your day off to sing, and here I am complaining.

1431
01:43:33,970 --> 01:43:36,270
Don't worry about it, you should relax when you get home.

1432
01:43:36,710 --> 01:43:39,270
It's not good to pile up your fatigue and leave it be.

1433
01:43:39,570 --> 01:43:40,030
Yeah,

1434
01:43:43,620 --> 01:43:44,080
good plan.

1435
01:43:44,460 --> 01:43:45,320
Thanks, Haighto-Kun.

1436
01:43:50,120 --> 01:43:51,900
It's like we're all at the same bar.

1437
01:43:52,120 --> 01:43:52,480
Exactly.

1438
01:43:52,920 --> 01:43:53,900
You're like my wingman.

1439
01:43:54,140 --> 01:43:55,200
You're all behind me.

1440
01:43:55,380 --> 01:43:56,240
Wingmanning me.

1441
01:43:57,340 --> 01:43:59,360
Do you have some sort of method to get rid of fatigue?

1442
01:43:59,780 --> 01:44:01,920
Something easy will be great if possible.

1443
01:44:02,480 --> 01:44:03,160
Not the naps.

1444
01:44:03,420 --> 01:44:04,580
Naps never work.

1445
01:44:08,160 --> 01:44:09,420
Okay, never.

1446
01:44:09,560 --> 01:44:10,180
Not the naps.

1447
01:44:10,400 --> 01:44:10,700
We learned.

1448
01:44:10,820 --> 01:44:11,400
We learned that.

1449
01:44:11,420 --> 01:44:13,560
That napping does not help at all.

1450
01:44:14,360 --> 01:44:15,780
How about eating something sweet?

1451
01:44:16,040 --> 01:44:17,300
How about getting a massage?

1452
01:44:18,040 --> 01:44:18,980
A massage.

1453
01:44:19,340 --> 01:44:19,520
Okay.

1454
01:44:20,020 --> 01:44:20,480
A massage.

1455
01:44:20,600 --> 01:44:21,480
I'm going to say a massage.

1456
01:44:22,500 --> 01:44:23,880
How about getting a massage?

1457
01:44:24,140 --> 01:44:25,420
Not by me, of course.

1458
01:44:25,560 --> 01:44:26,740
But like, if you insist.

1459
01:44:29,200 --> 01:44:33,880
Oh, a massage?

1460
01:44:34,300 --> 01:44:35,200
Would be great.

1461
01:44:35,840 --> 01:44:37,560
Maybe I should buy a massage device.

1462
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:40,540
I hope there's something that's easy to use at home.

1463
01:44:44,330 --> 01:44:45,710
She liked that answer, guys.

1464
01:44:45,870 --> 01:44:46,170
We did it.

1465
01:44:46,190 --> 01:44:46,990
We're so in.

1466
01:44:49,110 --> 01:44:52,250
Oh, and you can't forget taking a nice warm bath, too.

1467
01:44:52,690 --> 01:44:56,390
Just sitting there in the warm water as your pain slowly
fades away.

1468
01:44:58,470 --> 01:45:02,990
Oh, you know, we could, you know, we can go to the hot
springs.

1469
01:45:04,210 --> 01:45:04,610
Whoa.

1470
01:45:07,410 --> 01:45:09,030
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1471
01:45:09,030 --> 01:45:11,090
I'm talking about the hot springs.

1472
01:45:13,170 --> 01:45:20,570
imagine me in the bathtub that's some forbidden territory
you can whoa bro what the fuck am i getting caught out for

my imagination that didn't totally happen like you don't
know that what do you mean me she doesn't know what i was

1474
01:45:32,390 --> 01:45:38,220
thinking about you were the one that brought it up

1475
01:45:45,620 --> 01:45:48,400
Where do you wash first when you're in the bath?

1476
01:45:48,480 --> 01:45:49,000
My hair.

1477
01:45:50,240 --> 01:45:50,440
What?

1478
01:45:51,580 --> 01:45:52,740
What hair?

1479
01:45:53,140 --> 01:45:54,720
Do you not wash your hair first?

1480
01:45:55,220 --> 01:45:56,840
That's where the water touches first.

1481
01:45:57,140 --> 01:45:58,560
How is that bad?

1482
01:46:06,640 --> 01:46:09,160
Wait, forget I even asked that.

1483
01:46:09,760 --> 01:46:11,700
The you and my mind has started to strip.

1484
01:46:12,100 --> 01:46:12,600

1485
01:46:18,420 --> 01:46:29,780

1488
01:46:48,880 --> 01:46:49,840
Don't blame me.

1489
01:46:50,020 --> 01:46:52,600
You're the one who's imagining the whole scenario.

1490
01:46:53,180 --> 01:46:54,740
Doesn't you get to play Twister now?

1491
01:46:57,040 --> 01:46:58,400
Is it already this late?

1492
01:46:58,700 --> 01:46:59,300
I'll head back.

1493
01:46:59,380 --> 01:46:59,940
No!

1494
01:47:00,300 --> 01:47:00,820
Haito!

1495
01:47:01,280 --> 01:47:02,940
We were so in!

1496

You don't leave when you're like literally there!

1497
01:47:11,020 --> 01:47:11,320
Haito!

1498
01:47:11,380 --> 01:47:13,580
You're so fucking stupid, Haito!

trying to get a better job right Alright All right, is it

1501
01:47:44,500 --> 01:47:45,220
job hunting time?

1502
01:47:45,300 --> 01:47:46,880
Can I actually get a better job, chat?

1503
01:47:47,480 --> 01:47:49,020
Oh, I hate though.

1504
01:47:50,680 --> 01:47:53,720
The fumble is so fucking crazy.

1505
01:47:54,280 --> 01:47:55,040
I need a note.

1506
01:47:55,240 --> 01:47:57,660
Do I actually get a better job, chat?

1507
01:47:58,000 --> 01:47:58,340
Yes?

1508
01:47:58,480 --> 01:47:58,860
Okay.

1509
01:47:59,740 --> 01:48:02,400
By applying on a dispatch recruitment date, you can earn
money.

1510
01:48:02,820 --> 01:48:04,500
One dispatch consumes 2K.

1511
01:48:04,880 --> 01:48:06,360
Be careful not to overwork.

Ah, she likes it.

1562
01:51:40,480 --> 01:51:42,020
I'll take care of it, of course.

1563
01:51:42,600 --> 01:51:50,100
kind of is your blood type oh yeah there's like in asia
cultures like a blood type is like a personality trait

1564
01:51:50,100 --> 01:52:04,600
actually is how did you know well you have a carefree vibe
about you i know especially with money right so you based it

1565
01:52:04,600 --> 01:52:09,580
off of a blood type personality test i don't know how
accurate something like that is

1566
01:52:15,880 --> 01:52:21,020
Well, whether you believe it or not isn't important, what's
important is that I can lead the conversation.

1567
01:52:22,400 --> 01:52:24,440
Well, let's see, would your blood type be?

1568
01:52:25,320 --> 01:52:28,760
Guys, okay, I actually don't like care about the blood type
person.

1569
01:52:29,160 --> 01:52:30,040
Holy shit!

1570
01:52:30,520 --> 01:52:34,520
So, I see that like astrology.

1571
01:52:36,280 --> 01:52:37,500
Let's see, thank you for the super chat.

1572
01:52:37,600 --> 01:52:38,320
Thank you, thank you.

1573

adventure thank you with the super chat thank you thank you

1575
01:52:54,860 --> 01:53:06,880

supposed to be the ganky one we use them my a b is normal so

1576
01:53:06,880 --> 01:53:18,520
probably b is more common a b is the universal recipient AB
is good because it's a universal recipient guys AB is

1577
01:53:18,520 --> 01:53:29,280
superior A is for kind people AB is two-faced always guys I
feel like a lot of you guys don't even know as well okay A

1578
01:53:29,280 --> 01:53:38,080
or B I'm gonna go with A I'm gonna go with A because A is
always a a good blood type right A perhaps Yes!

1579
01:53:40,040 --> 01:53:44,100
Are you suggesting I'm a methodical person, serious and
sincere too?

1580
01:53:44,260 --> 01:53:45,080
I knew it.

1581
01:53:45,580 --> 01:53:46,360
I knew it.

1582
01:53:46,400 --> 01:53:51,280
My Asian genes spoke to me because A is always better than
B.

1583
01:53:51,460 --> 01:53:54,940
I mean, serious and sincere too?

1584
01:53:55,280 --> 01:53:56,940
You know me too well.

1585
01:53:57,300 --> 01:53:58,080
We're so in.

1586
01:53:58,540 --> 01:54:00,660
The correct answer was O type the same.

1587
01:54:00,980 --> 01:54:03,900
Okay, I didn't even get that as a choice.

1588
01:54:04,540 --> 01:54:06,880
I don't care too much about the details.

1589
01:54:06,900 --> 01:54:09,600
And I'm pretty easy going, wouldn't you say?

1590
01:54:11,600 --> 01:54:15,700
Well, when you put it that way, I suppose I see that inside
of you.

1591
01:54:16,320 --> 01:54:20,880
But if I said you were methodical or emotional, for example,
you feel that way too, right?

1592
01:54:21,400 --> 01:54:29,300
I guess you're right.

1593
01:54:29,560 --> 01:54:31,020
Sorry, I thought it could be...

1594
01:54:31,020 --> 01:54:33,740
Oh my gosh, why am I so bad at this?

1595
01:54:34,120 --> 01:54:35,420
Why is Haito...

1596
01:54:35,420 --> 01:54:37,820
Haito, I worked so hard trying to get you, Kana.

1597
01:54:38,080 --> 01:54:39,560
But you always fuck it up.

1598
01:54:39,900 --> 01:54:41,740
Why do you do this to me?

1599
01:54:42,340 --> 01:54:45,720
I spent so much of our money for her.

1600
01:54:47,760 --> 01:54:50,020
No, I should be the one apologizing.

1601
01:54:50,460 --> 01:54:54,280
You went through all that trouble thinking up with someone
to talk about.

1602
01:54:55,560 --> 01:54:57,380
Right, what blood type are your parents?

1603
01:54:59,560 --> 01:55:03,280
My dad is A and my mom is B.

1604
01:55:03,540 --> 01:55:07,420
I don't know why you're bringing this up where the
personalities are nothing like the readings.

1605
01:55:08,140 --> 01:55:09,100
I don't know!

1606
01:55:11,840 --> 01:55:15,440
I even bought her the second most expensive wine!

1607
01:55:17,900 --> 01:55:21,160
Sorry, I can't even control this!

1608
01:55:24,520 --> 01:55:26,560
Bro, I can't control incompetence!

1609
01:55:30,340 --> 01:55:33,220
I'll do my best not to ruin the vibes like that again.

1610
01:55:34,080 --> 01:55:35,400
Gambit, thank you for the super chat.

1611
01:55:35,560 --> 01:55:36,120
Thank you, thank you.

1612
01:55:36,240 --> 01:55:38,180
Blood-type tomato juice.

1613
01:55:39,800 --> 01:55:40,760
Self-sabotage.

1614
01:55:41,560 --> 01:55:43,040
I just want to tease you a little return.

1615
01:55:43,500 --> 01:55:57,380

afford a little splurge.

1618
01:56:10,280 --> 01:56:11,940
Yep, yep, it tastes great.

1619
01:56:14,020 --> 01:56:14,400
Alright.

1620
01:56:15,300 --> 01:56:17,840
We'll look at the most respectable part of the body.

1621
01:56:18,380 --> 01:56:19,020
The hair.

1622
01:56:22,640 --> 01:56:25,380
I can't give any more presents today.

1623
01:56:25,920 --> 01:56:27,440
Oh, don't worry, we can buy sushi.

1624
01:56:27,980 --> 01:56:30,240
We can buy sushi because I know how much you love sushi.

1625
01:56:30,360 --> 01:56:32,040
And I have the extra money right now.

1626
01:56:33,500 --> 01:56:35,000
Yep, yep, it tastes great.

1627
01:56:35,500 --> 01:56:36,380
Kana, didn't you say that?

1628
01:56:37,120 --> 01:56:37,740
You're perfect.

1629
01:56:38,400 --> 01:56:40,740
Ice cream, cake, nah.

1630
01:56:42,800 --> 01:56:44,580
Mochi is an option too.

1631
01:56:45,620 --> 01:56:47,400
Damn you, Toki.

1632
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:51,880
Are you thinking about what to have for dessert when you get
home?

1633
01:56:55,520 --> 01:56:56,940
She's always hungry.

1634
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:00,020
How did you know?

1635
01:57:00,360 --> 01:57:03,080
That looked like I was that hungry for some sugary treats?

1636
01:57:05,660 --> 01:57:08,520
I mean, you were the one mothering about it, though.

1637
01:57:08,740 --> 01:57:10,980
I guess you didn't realize that you said that.

1638
01:57:17,880 --> 01:57:19,580
I want to eat all three, to be honest.

1639
01:57:19,840 --> 01:57:23,440
Ice cream, cake, mochi, they're all amazing.

1640
01:57:23,900 --> 01:57:26,400
I know I could destroy all three in the heartbeat.

1641
01:57:33,020 --> 01:57:35,520
I did something so extreme at night.

1642
01:57:36,140 --> 01:57:40,380
I know I'll wake up in the middle of night with nothing but
regret for my actions.

1643
01:57:42,500 --> 01:57:44,760
Well, eating too much is never good for your body either.

1644
01:57:45,260 --> 01:57:46,900
You should probably just choose the one.

1645
01:57:49,020 --> 01:57:52,100
Guys, what do you think she likes the most, guys?

1646
01:57:52,840 --> 01:57:54,200
Does she ever tell me what she...

1647
01:57:54,200 --> 01:57:56,620
She never told me what dessert she likes the most!

1648
01:57:57,000 --> 01:57:59,080
How am I... Okay, what's the best dessert?

1649
01:57:59,720 --> 01:58:00,880
How about cake?

1650
01:58:03,080 --> 01:58:04,880
Mochi, cake, ice cream?

1651
01:58:05,100 --> 01:58:05,360
Okay.

1652
01:58:06,200 --> 01:58:06,540
Cake.

1653
01:58:06,740 --> 01:58:07,940
It has to be cake, right?

1654
01:58:08,800 --> 01:58:18,440
cake is is universally loved there's so many different
flavors with cake i actually bought some chocolate cake last

1655
01:58:18,440 --> 01:58:24,340
night so i need to eat it while it's fresh yeah that's
definitely i did it i knew it i made the right choice

1656
01:58:24,340 --> 01:58:25,880
without any help whatsoever

1657
01:58:30,180 --> 01:58:35,420
maybe i should just eat it all i can't decide i love them
all equally

1658
01:58:43,240 --> 01:58:44,680
Nice guest, Doki.

1659
01:58:47,020 --> 01:58:48,380
It's not a guest.

1660
01:58:48,780 --> 01:58:51,620
I know the way to Kana's heart and not you.

1661
01:58:52,420 --> 01:58:54,140
And there may be enjoyed after all.

1662
01:58:54,660 --> 01:58:58,480
I think it's my civil duty to enjoy them all to their
fullest.

1663
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:04,840
Yep, that's my civil duty.

1664
01:59:06,720 --> 01:59:14,940
Oh my gosh, that was a very long sentence she said for, my
civil duty i'm worried you're gonna have an upset stomach by

It's just 100 yen more.

1669
01:59:48,820 --> 01:59:52,180
Well, looking at her hair.

1670
01:59:52,500 --> 01:59:56,280
All right, conversation time.

1671
02:00:01,640 --> 02:00:04,160
All right, so what do you have when you...

1672
02:00:04,160 --> 02:00:06,400
So what do you do when you have spare time at home?

1673
02:00:14,780 --> 02:00:19,000
I always play with Wawa-chin, my Chihuahua.

1674
02:00:19,280 --> 02:00:24,540
I'll start to play with him and by the time I realize it
ends up being the dead of night.

1675
02:00:25,820 --> 02:00:29,320
If anything, maybe Wawa-chin is looking after you.

1676
02:00:32,900 --> 02:00:34,940
What do you do at home, Haito-kun?

1677
02:00:36,060 --> 02:00:37,440
Well, video games for one.

1678
02:00:37,860 --> 02:00:39,660
I'll play on console.

1679
02:00:45,400 --> 02:00:46,720
I'll play on a car.

1680
02:00:46,940 --> 02:00:47,240
Oh my gosh.

1681
02:00:47,300 --> 02:00:48,580
I have hit rock bottom.

1682
02:00:48,980 --> 02:00:52,220
I'll play on a console I have at home Then play a little bit
on my phone.

1683
02:00:52,260 --> 02:00:57,120
Oh, no, I'm also a gotcha gamer before I sleep Where's my
PC?

1684
02:00:58,100 --> 02:01:01,180
I have a PC What happened to steam?

1685
02:01:01,560 --> 02:01:13,560
I'm literally playing this on steam Games Kana You not like
video games Kana After I spent like I'm pretty sure I spent

1686
02:01:13,560 --> 02:01:24,560

gonna tell me games huh oh do you dislike video games kind

say that was my deal breaker it would have been over console

1688
02:01:38,240 --> 02:01:47,380
is cool too yes but not just console i need to expand You
need to expand them!

1689
02:01:47,640 --> 02:01:49,900
There's also PC gaming!

1690
02:01:50,640 --> 02:01:51,500
Ha ha ha!

1691
02:01:52,740 --> 02:01:54,540
Nope, I love them actually.

1692
02:01:55,220 --> 02:01:57,760
But that's exactly why I made myself stop playing.

1693
02:02:00,500 --> 02:02:02,240
And I end up being really loud, you see.

1694
02:02:02,540 --> 02:02:03,920
Oh, is it because of...

1695
02:02:03,920 --> 02:02:06,980
Don't worry, my apartment has soundproofs, so if you...

1696
02:02:06,980 --> 02:02:09,380
Wait, no, that's not what I mean!

1697
02:02:09,640 --> 02:02:10,360
For gaming!

1698
02:02:10,760 --> 02:02:11,480
For gaming!

1699
02:02:12,500 --> 02:02:14,620
So neighbors won't complain for gaming!

1700
02:02:21,520 --> 02:02:29,280
I won't say things like I'll get your damn you I will oh my
gosh she's toxic she's perfect you know the usual

1701
02:02:34,500 --> 02:02:39,680
Am I try to hold back I'll be back to shutting by the time I
realized it

1702
02:02:46,280 --> 02:02:52,140
That's why I forced myself to stop playing I don't want to
cause any disturbances to my neighbors, you know.

1703
02:02:52,380 --> 02:02:53,000
That's what I heard.

1704
02:02:53,120 --> 02:02:57,200
I heard in Japan, it's really hard to get, like, a place
that was soundproofing for streamers.

1705
02:02:57,720 --> 02:03:00,700
Because, like, you know, especially, like, streamers are,
like, really loud and stuff.

1706
02:03:01,060 --> 02:03:03,920
Like, you can get, like, called on by the police and stuff
very easily.

1707
02:03:05,900 --> 02:03:07,160
That's a bit of a shame.

1708
02:03:07,460 --> 02:03:08,880
I never knew you were so passionate.

1709
02:03:08,940 --> 02:03:09,340
Oh, my God.

1710
02:03:09,380 --> 02:03:10,260
Thank God she's perfect.

1711
02:03:10,360 --> 02:03:12,380
I thought she was going to judge me for my gaming.

1712
02:03:12,780 --> 02:03:14,820
I was ready to go to another girl.

1713
02:03:15,140 --> 02:03:17,260
I was so fucking ready to be, like, bye.

1714
02:03:19,580 --> 02:03:26,200
don't you play puzzle games instead of something that's so
action focused you know something that uses your height

1715
02:03:26,200 --> 02:03:32,880
though what the fuck why would you suggest puzzle game oh my
god heighto does not represent me

1716
02:03:36,680 --> 02:03:38,800
i would have walked away

1717
02:03:42,320 --> 02:03:50,320
it's all the same i end up being overly passionate even if
i'm solving a puzzle Super chat, thank you, thank you.

1718
02:03:50,840 --> 02:03:52,660
Kana says gamer words.

1719
02:03:54,640 --> 02:03:57,800
I'll be allowed for being so hyper after beating a tough
puzzle.

1720
02:03:58,240 --> 02:04:01,340
And similarly, I'll be allowed if I can beat a harder
puzzle.

1721
02:04:02,580 --> 02:04:06,320
In a way, I'm jealous of how passionate you are towards
video games.

1722
02:04:11,900 --> 02:04:13,020
Oh my god.

1723
02:04:13,180 --> 02:04:14,780
I'll buy you one right now.

1724
02:04:15,060 --> 02:04:17,160
Who cares if I need the loan money, Kana?

1725
02:04:18,880 --> 02:04:22,180
If I ever become rich, I'll buy a soundproof room.

1726
02:04:22,440 --> 02:04:24,600
And then I'll play video games to my heart's content.

1727
02:04:25,020 --> 02:04:26,760
So I'll be patient for now.

1728
02:04:36,550 --> 02:04:38,090
Do you want something to take with you?

1729
02:04:38,330 --> 02:04:40,630
You know, maybe something that symbolizes our friendship.

1730
02:04:42,330 --> 02:04:44,390
I have something perfect.

1731
02:04:45,830 --> 02:04:46,010
What?

1732
02:04:47,090 --> 02:04:47,610
Yes?

1733
02:04:48,090 --> 02:04:48,330
Yes?

1734
02:04:48,510 --> 02:04:49,050
Yes, Kana?

1735
02:04:50,230 --> 02:04:50,590
Oh!

1736
02:04:53,330 --> 02:04:53,850
Okay.

1737
02:04:54,390 --> 02:04:55,170
It's time.

1738
02:04:59,780 --> 02:05:01,200
Oh my god.

1739
02:05:01,740 --> 02:05:04,320
Cast members may invite you to play mini games.

1740
02:05:04,480 --> 02:05:05,900
You can pay a fee.

1741
02:05:06,800 --> 02:05:07,280
All right.

1742
02:05:08,100 --> 02:05:09,380
And enjoy.

1743
02:05:10,060 --> 02:05:12,300
She's like, can I invite you after hours?

1744
02:05:12,480 --> 02:05:14,640
By the way, it'll be 100,000 yen.

1745
02:05:16,180 --> 02:05:18,780
Oh, a polar...

1746
02:05:18,780 --> 02:05:19,760
Yes, yes.

1747
02:05:21,660 --> 02:05:22,360
Of course.

1748
02:05:23,080 --> 02:05:23,660
Oh my god.

1749
02:05:24,100 --> 02:05:26,340
I'm gonna get a Polaroid photo.

1750
02:05:28,900 --> 02:05:30,260
This is not Twister.

1751
02:05:35,000 --> 02:05:37,480
You select the pose and take a photo.

1752
02:05:37,880 --> 02:05:39,560
You can check the photos you took from your home.

1753
02:05:40,120 --> 02:05:43,700
As your likability increases, the number of pose increases
as well.

1754
02:05:44,920 --> 02:05:45,160
Okay.

1755
02:05:45,600 --> 02:05:46,020
Oh!

1756
02:05:49,000 --> 02:05:50,800

I'm trying to decide.

1767
02:06:46,500 --> 02:06:47,640
It's so difficult!

1768
02:06:49,360 --> 02:06:50,980

I can go into a little bit of debt.

It's too dangerous.

1820
02:10:57,390 --> 02:10:58,870
You guys are cowards.

1821
02:10:59,730 --> 02:11:07,250
Olive, if you don't spend it all for your one true hostess,
then what's the point?

1822
02:11:08,490 --> 02:11:10,050
Do it for her.

1823
02:11:11,990 --> 02:11:12,630
Really?

1824
02:11:13,090 --> 02:11:14,470

1828
02:11:24,790 --> 02:11:25,990
Kana, Kana, Kana.

It's okay.

1831
02:11:34,530 --> 02:11:36,050
Will you be willing to accept this?

1832
02:11:36,930 --> 02:11:37,650
Accept this?

1833
02:11:38,070 --> 02:11:39,250

02:11:44,750 --> 02:11:45,930
Anything for you?

1839
02:11:47,610 --> 02:11:49,230
There's something I want to talk to you about.

1840
02:11:49,570 --> 02:11:50,270
What is it?

1841
02:11:50,530 --> 02:11:53,770
What is it, Kana?

1842
02:11:54,890 --> 02:11:55,450
It's okay.

1843
02:11:55,530 --> 02:11:56,470
I have two livers.

1844
02:11:56,870 --> 02:11:57,650
I have two livers.

1845
02:11:57,850 --> 02:11:58,430
No, wait.

1846
02:11:58,530 --> 02:11:58,990
No, I have one.

1847
02:11:59,130 --> 02:12:05,530
I have two kidneys, two eyes, two ears, two hands, two feet.

1848
02:12:06,050 --> 02:12:07,370
I don't need two.

1849
02:12:08,250 --> 02:12:09,650
One can do the job.

1850
02:12:12,030 --> 02:12:19,570
actually forget I mentioned it no no tell me I spent a
hundred I spent a hundred and eighty thousand yen on you for

can't go and bring my own issues no no I'm a good listener,

1853
02:12:37,650 --> 02:12:37,710
Kano.

1854
02:12:39,610 --> 02:12:40,070
Not at all.

1855
02:12:40,190 --> 02:12:42,870
I'll do anything I can to listen to your problems.

1856
02:12:45,390 --> 02:12:46,450
Thanks, Haida-Kun.

1857
02:12:48,510 --> 02:12:50,970
I might take your offer of kindness then.

1858
02:12:51,230 --> 02:12:52,530
I have ten fingers.

1859
02:12:52,970 --> 02:12:54,230
I don't need ten fingers.

1860
02:12:55,550 --> 02:12:57,410
Yeah, your liver regrows, technically.

1861
02:12:59,390 --> 02:13:02,050
My dad from back in the countryside called me.

1862
02:13:02,390 --> 02:13:03,750
He told me to come back.

1863
02:13:10,690 --> 02:13:12,930
But there's still so much I want to do here.

1864
02:13:13,130 --> 02:13:14,670
So I told him that I won't return home.

1865
02:13:15,010 --> 02:13:16,310
Don't listen to your father.

1866
02:13:16,570 --> 02:13:17,430
Listen to me.

1867
02:13:21,450 --> 02:13:22,290
I see.

1868
02:13:22,950 --> 02:13:27,170
I'm sure he's just worried about his own daughter who lives
so far away from him.

1869
02:13:29,330 --> 02:13:31,470
I can donate so much.

1870
02:13:33,230 --> 02:13:34,590
Anything for Kano.

1871
02:13:36,390 --> 02:13:38,590
I know, but that's exactly why I feel a little guilty.

1872
02:13:38,610 --> 02:13:41,630
when I mentioned not wanting to come back.

1873
02:13:42,170 --> 02:13:43,370
I'll be your...

1874
02:13:43,370 --> 02:13:47,090
I'll be your new dad.

1875
02:13:50,330 --> 02:13:50,950
Hold on.

1876
02:13:51,190 --> 02:13:53,990
I never talked to you about my family back home, right?

1877
02:13:54,850 --> 02:13:56,290
Cass, thank you for the super chat.

1878
02:13:56,610 --> 02:13:57,770
Thank you, thank you.

1879
02:13:58,430 --> 02:14:01,710
I'm learning so many new stats from the stream.

1880
02:14:02,130 --> 02:14:05,550
All these unnecessary organs I never see anyway.

1881
02:14:06,030 --> 02:14:08,550
Thank you for the super chat.

1882
02:14:08,610 --> 02:14:10,290
Thank you.

1883
02:14:10,770 --> 02:14:12,870
I remember you bringing them up briefly.

1884
02:14:13,370 --> 02:14:14,770
Remember when we talked about blood types?

1885
02:14:15,230 --> 02:14:15,750
Let's see.

1886
02:14:16,890 --> 02:14:17,030
Oh.

1887
02:14:17,530 --> 02:14:20,530
Dad and mom are A and B, right?

1888
02:14:21,110 --> 02:14:22,290
Dad and mom.

1889
02:14:23,430 --> 02:14:25,730
Guys, I know the answer.

1890
02:14:26,210 --> 02:14:28,170
But do you know the answer?

1891
02:14:32,370 --> 02:14:35,230
Guys, I know what the answers are.

1892
02:14:35,450 --> 02:14:37,310
But do you know what it is?

1893
02:14:38,610 --> 02:14:40,210
I'm gonna test you guys.

1894
02:14:40,590 --> 02:14:41,690
What was it?

1895
02:14:46,050 --> 02:14:46,990
Yeah, yeah, you do.

1896
02:14:47,070 --> 02:14:48,050
Oh, yeah, prove it.

1897
02:14:48,150 --> 02:14:50,190
Prove that you know the answer, chat.

1898
02:14:50,670 --> 02:14:52,770
Unless you're lying to me.

1899
02:14:56,330 --> 02:14:57,350
Whereas I always knew.

1900
02:14:57,510 --> 02:14:58,070
I already knew.

1901
02:15:00,150 --> 02:15:00,470
Oh, wow.

1902
02:15:00,670 --> 02:15:02,870
I can't believe you even remembered that.

1903
02:15:03,050 --> 02:15:04,750
I'm kind of happy that you knew it.

1904
02:15:06,270 --> 02:15:07,170
Of course, Kana.

1905
02:15:08,610 --> 02:15:12,410
at least $10,000 on you, I'll always remember.

1906
02:15:13,790 --> 02:15:16,750
I'm making my dad sad, aren't I?

1907
02:15:22,070 --> 02:15:24,450
I don't want him to feel that way at all.

1908
02:15:26,150 --> 02:15:32,150
I won't deny that he doesn't feel sad, but I'm sure he'll
come back to understand your desire to stay there.

1909
02:15:33,850 --> 02:15:36,070
I mean, you're telling how you really feel after all.

1910
02:15:36,850 --> 02:15:39,290
He'll be proud of you, except your viewpoint for sure.

1911
02:15:44,020 --> 02:15:45,060
Haito-Kun, thanks.

1912
02:15:45,220 --> 02:15:45,760
Of course!

1913
02:15:46,080 --> 02:15:46,940
Of course, Kana!

1914
02:15:56,720 --> 02:16:00,580
I can't go home yet because I need to still achieve my goals
here.

1915
02:16:00,980 --> 02:16:02,580
But do my... What goals?

1916
02:16:08,240 --> 02:16:10,820
I'm actually curious what the goals are.

1917
02:16:12,500 --> 02:16:15,880
I'll do my best not to make my dad feel sad too.

1918
02:16:24,560 --> 02:16:26,860
Maybe I should call him more often.

1919
02:16:27,080 --> 02:16:29,240
Oh, and I have to mention you to him too, of course.

1920
02:16:29,960 --> 02:16:32,760
Yes, that's all dads want to hear.

1921
02:16:35,660 --> 02:16:42,680
The guy that's giving so much money to his daughter for her
to give attention to him.

1922
02:16:43,360 --> 02:16:46,540
That's what all dads want to hear in the countryside.

1923
02:16:49,540 --> 02:16:53,760
I'll tell him how much you uplift me whenever we talk with
money

1924
02:17:05,000 --> 02:17:10,860
oh but I tell my dad that he might take it in the wrong way
you don't like that would you

1925
02:17:15,180 --> 02:17:22,880
maybe I'll stay quiet about you for the time being then no

02:18:31,780 --> 02:18:32,540
Thank you, thank you.

1939
02:18:32,680 --> 02:18:34,000
Who paid money for attention?

1940
02:18:34,120 --> 02:18:34,340
Weird.

1941
02:18:34,600 --> 02:18:35,940
Toki, decide for me, please.

1942
02:18:36,020 --> 02:18:37,880
Should I make a ginger chewy cookie?

1943
02:18:38,880 --> 02:18:40,720
Or hazelnut brown butter cake?

1944
02:18:40,820 --> 02:18:41,700
Thank you for the super chat.

1945
02:18:41,900 --> 02:18:42,360
Thank you.

1946
02:18:42,360 --> 02:18:42,800
You know what?

1947
02:18:42,800 --> 02:18:44,180
Get the brown butter cake.

1948
02:18:44,540 --> 02:18:45,540
Kana likes cake.

1949
02:18:46,560 --> 02:18:54,000
like cake i already bought sushi she didn't give me like a
nice answer i feel like my hair is getting kind of long make

1950
02:18:54,000 --> 02:18:59,260
sure maybe i should book an appointment at the hairdresser
soon how much would it cost i got you like

1951
02:19:03,700 --> 02:19:15,240
short or long or something i don't think i have any sort of
preference like that i like i like kana shaped hair how

1952
02:19:18,330 --> 02:19:26,790
about hair color then do you like brighter tones or nice but
so are darker ones

1953
02:19:30,670 --> 02:19:38,650
look my entire preferences is just you now okay i i'm a
little annoyed at how much you don't seem to care all that

1954
02:19:38,650 --> 02:19:52,150
much hey don't you fucking blew it it's like how like girls
are like do you notice anything different and the guys are

1955
02:19:52,150 --> 02:20:03,230
just your hair I think you can at least seem a little more
interested You know It feels like you don't care about my

1956
02:20:03,230 --> 02:20:14,930
hair at all Sorry I wasn't trying to say that at all I'm
saying that you could pull off any hairstyle or color I

1957
02:20:14,930 --> 02:20:18,210
really don't mean that I really do mean that Sorry I really
do mean that

1958
02:20:22,330 --> 02:20:29,970
Of course You're doubting me already Bought you the fucking
150k yen champagne.

1959
02:20:30,790 --> 02:20:33,490
And I only had 146.

1960
02:20:35,810 --> 02:20:36,570
I do.

1961
02:20:36,970 --> 02:20:40,650
Besides not having a preference isn't necessarily a bad
thing, is it?

1962
02:20:40,810 --> 02:20:43,010
That means you can make anything work, Kana.

1963
02:20:44,690 --> 02:20:51,130
I can promise you that no matter what hairstyle you decide
to go with, I'll visit you the same amount as always.

1964
02:20:51,410 --> 02:20:53,530
Look, I haven't even talked to another woman.

1965
02:20:53,870 --> 02:20:55,350
I only talked to you, Kana.

1966
02:20:56,530 --> 02:21:03,270
I'm sure I'll become more attracted to you going forward,
but I'll never start disliking you because you change your

1967
02:21:03,270 --> 02:21:21,090
appearance That's so unfair, Haito-Kun I can't say anything
back when you say something so kind like, Oh my god, Haito,

1968
02:21:21,210 --> 02:21:21,650
you did it.

1969
02:21:21,830 --> 02:21:29,390
You finally clutched it for once in your life Of course, of
course, let's talk more

1970
02:21:32,670 --> 02:21:41,710
all right i'll get my i'll you know what i'll change it up
i'll get the ulong hi-ba and then i know you love the

1971
02:21:41,710 --> 02:21:46,010
special hi-ba it tastes amazing i love this

1972
02:21:50,090 --> 02:21:58,990
yay her beautiful hair that we all love and her beautiful
hands that have a photo of

1973
02:22:02,790 --> 02:22:04,630
Okay, I'm not reading that out.

1974
02:22:06,090 --> 02:22:07,570
What are you doing?

1975
02:22:16,050 --> 02:22:19,310
You know, this job is all about talking with others, right?

1976
02:22:19,770 --> 02:22:21,950
So I do all sorts of vocal exercises.

1977
02:22:22,550 --> 02:22:24,090
So I don't mess up my words.

1978
02:22:24,990 --> 02:22:26,330
Oh, your enunciation, huh?

1979
02:22:26,850 --> 02:22:29,910
I suppose that would make sense to practice so you don't
fumble your sentences.

1980
02:22:30,090 --> 02:22:40,790
I say as I never practice and now you can tell why I You can
tell why I pronounce things the way I do She sells seashells

1981
02:22:40,790 --> 02:22:43,650
by the seashore Okay, that is definitely not it

1982
02:22:47,270 --> 02:22:51,410
That's definitely not the translation to what she said

1983
02:22:56,430 --> 02:23:02,270
Tongue twisters impressive You didn't even stumble,
Kana-chan Okay, I'm sorry

1984
02:23:12,020 --> 02:23:15,620
I used to be in the drama club back in the day, actually.

1985
02:23:16,140 --> 02:23:18,480
We used to do this sort of practice all the time.

1986
02:23:20,800 --> 02:23:22,780
Kanachan, you were in the drama club?

1987
02:23:23,200 --> 02:23:24,340
Now I'm curious.

1988
02:23:28,020 --> 02:23:28,880
Were you always...

1989
02:23:28,880 --> 02:23:30,560
Did you mainly practice acting?

1990
02:23:30,860 --> 02:23:33,660
Okay, I don't think I should say these.

1991
02:23:33,800 --> 02:23:34,820
Okay, did you mainly practice acting?

1992
02:23:34,840 --> 02:23:35,560
practice acting?

1993
02:23:39,420 --> 02:23:40,780
You're not an actor?

1994
02:23:41,060 --> 02:23:45,000
Why the fuck were you doing fucking word exercise?

1995
02:23:50,100 --> 02:23:51,220
Why the fuck?

1996
02:23:56,940 --> 02:24:01,480
Of course I would assume you're an actor for doing word
exercise.

1997
02:24:02,160 --> 02:24:03,860
I was on the sound team.

1998
02:24:04,480 --> 02:24:14,020
And I was literally I was like the sound I was a
behind-the-scenes sound team we did not practice fucking

1999
02:24:14,020 --> 02:24:24,300
sound exercise actors are the pinnacle what most people in
drama want to become aren't they but I wasn't like that I

2000
02:24:24,300 --> 02:24:35,200
was part of the lighting crew I was like lighting and sound
I was part of the lighting and sound crew given the actors

2001
02:24:35,200 --> 02:24:41,460
their spotlight and thinking about light and whatnot mostly
on the lights though i worked mostly on the lights but if we

2002
02:24:41,460 --> 02:24:52,300
needed if our sound guy wasn't there like i would like
attempt to do the sound because i had like seniority but i

2003
02:24:52,300 --> 02:25:00,100
was like i was what was it called like the the crew the crew
in charge the behind the scenes crew i actually got like uh

2004
02:25:00,100 --> 02:25:09,660
back then okay sorry kana this is my time to share my story
but like back then I think in like in high school there was

2005
02:25:09,660 --> 02:25:18,320
a convention slash conference for like um theater people one
time I was selected for like the drama side but like the

2006
02:25:18,320 --> 02:25:25,160
second time I was selected to do the behind the scenes and
like only several students uh I think like only three people

2007
02:25:25,160 --> 02:25:34,140
are selected per school to go represent the school for this
like uh drama conference or whatever and basically like each

2008
02:25:34,140 --> 02:25:41,160
school select three students one will be the band One will
be like the, from the band class, one will be in the acting,

2009
02:25:41,360 --> 02:25:42,920
and the other will be like the technician.

2010
02:25:43,340 --> 02:25:49,300
So I got selected for, one time I got selected for acting,
and then the other time I got selected for a technician.

2011
02:25:49,820 --> 02:25:53,520
So like, I've done like technician and acting for the
conference.

2012
02:25:53,740 --> 02:25:59,180
And then it's basically all the students from each school
come together and produce like some show.

2013
02:26:00,280 --> 02:26:02,420
Like it's there to like improve your knowledge.

2014
02:26:03,900 --> 02:26:06,200
It's to improve your knowledge and your skill set.

2015
02:26:06,980 --> 02:26:14,000
come together like all like each school comes together to
make this giant show based off of like um all these like

2016
02:26:14,000 --> 02:26:22,240
really talented individuals in each like sector and uh and
that's why this is it's so fucking bullshit that she was

2017
02:26:22,240 --> 02:26:28,360
like i was part of the lightning lightning crew and she's
trying to like bait me with the pronunciation like how is i

2018
02:26:28,360 --> 02:26:34,600
supposed to know she was in lightning how how is i supposed
to know she was in lighting if she talked about

2019
02:26:34,600 --> 02:26:35,940
pronunciation and tongue

2020
02:26:40,180 --> 02:26:50,000
I see I just assumed that most people in the drama club
Would want to act more than anything Fucking poser Tell you

2021
02:26:50,000 --> 02:26:50,660
the honest truth

2022
02:26:54,680 --> 02:27:01,620
I want to act too Look guys this is why I'm not an actor I
don't do ton twisters Of course I fumble with my words She

2023
02:27:01,620 --> 02:27:07,820
was right I fumble with my words That's why I going to begin
with.

2024
02:27:13,280 --> 02:27:14,000
Sira, thank you.

2025
02:27:14,140 --> 02:27:15,400
Sira's Lee, thank you for the super chat.

2026
02:27:15,640 --> 02:27:16,200
Thank you.

2027
02:27:17,340 --> 02:27:18,220
Girl could come back.

2028
02:27:18,280 --> 02:27:19,960
Thank you for a super chat, by the way.

2029
02:27:20,740 --> 02:27:22,340
Girl could come back looking like a tomato.

2030
02:27:22,520 --> 02:27:23,700
Little does she know we're into that.

2031
02:27:23,820 --> 02:27:25,600
Thank you for existing, Doki.

2032
02:27:26,140 --> 02:27:28,040
I didn't have the crew should act in front of an audience.

2033
02:27:28,720 --> 02:27:32,660
So I panicked and went for the lighting crew position
instead.

2034
02:27:35,940 --> 02:27:36,960
Don't get me wrong.

2035
02:27:38,060 --> 02:27:39,740
I enjoyed doing the lighting

2036
02:27:43,680 --> 02:27:49,740
I really did give it my all while learning the importance of
behind the scenes work Also for the conference like you we

2037
02:27:49,740 --> 02:27:56,580
had to travel so it's not like in our area The school would
like pay for like the travel cost to whatever school was

2038
02:27:56,580 --> 02:28:03,500
hosting it at that time But because I was working behind the
scenes I could see the actor perform in the spotlight from

2039
02:28:03,500 --> 02:28:07,080
so close So we would like travel really far at one point.

2040
02:28:16,320 --> 02:28:19,720
My dreams kept getting bigger and bigger while me really
striving towards them.

2041
02:28:20,060 --> 02:28:21,940
And that brings me to the day, I guess.

2042
02:28:24,360 --> 02:28:26,340
I love to see you in action one of these days.

2043
02:28:26,680 --> 02:28:28,040
Working on the lights, Kana-chan.

2044
02:28:28,440 --> 02:28:30,320
She's told you she wants to be a fucking actor.

2045
02:28:31,100 --> 02:28:31,520
Well,

2046
02:28:42,000 --> 02:28:44,740
I guess I could do my best to try once again.

2047
02:28:45,100 --> 02:28:47,700
I hope one day I can bring you the good news that I'm back
at it.

2048
02:28:49,260 --> 02:28:49,660
Yes!

2049
02:28:51,900 --> 02:28:52,880
Oh, come on.

2050
02:28:53,040 --> 02:28:54,380

Yeah.

2052
02:28:58,200 --> 02:29:00,260
I'm sure you'll have fun if you went through with it.

2053
02:29:00,380 --> 02:29:01,180
Come on, let's do it.

2054
02:29:01,400 --> 02:29:02,300
Oh my god, yes.

02:29:02,520 --> 02:29:03,860
Please not be the hand game.

You can spin the roulette every time you pay a fee in the
castle.

2060
02:29:26,140 --> 02:29:30,200
Move their limbs according to the instructions given on the
roulette wheel.

I was sweating a little.

2094
02:32:07,120 --> 02:32:08,600
I've been so locked.

2095
02:32:08,700 --> 02:32:11,840
I've been so locked in in my life.

2096
02:32:14,240 --> 02:32:17,300
When it gets so late, I guess I'll head back soon.

2097
02:32:20,380 --> 02:32:21,540
Oh my god.

2105
02:32:40,420 --> 02:32:43,640
But I don't want you to feel pressured by now either.

2106
02:32:46,080 --> 02:32:48,760
When the cast members are in a good mood.

2107
02:32:49,160 --> 02:32:50,360

Oh, my God.

2124
02:34:02,280 --> 02:34:05,620
Where are we going to go with negative cash?

2125
02:34:06,380 --> 02:34:08,460
Don't look at my face too much.

2126
02:34:15,000 --> 02:34:16,420
Anything else, you can cry this much?

2127
02:34:16,580 --> 02:34:17,520
My face looks awful.

2128
02:34:17,620 --> 02:34:19,180
Oh, did we just finish watching a movie?

2129
02:34:19,940 --> 02:34:20,740
That was amazing.

2130
02:34:21,200 --> 02:34:23,640
I think this has definitely landed my top three movies now.

2131
02:34:23,880 --> 02:34:27,200
Oh, guys, I don't even get to see that movie.

2132
02:34:28,800 --> 02:34:30,060
That's how broke I was.

2133
02:34:30,240 --> 02:34:31,620
They cut off the movie content.

2134
02:34:35,880 --> 02:34:36,760
Your face?

2135
02:34:37,120 --> 02:34:37,920
I think so too.

2136
02:34:38,120 --> 02:34:41,440
I like this director's previous work, but this might be my
favorite.

2137
02:34:42,300 --> 02:34:44,060
You sure know your movies, Kana-chan.

2138
02:34:48,640 --> 02:34:50,580
I'm trying to be an actress, remember?

2139
02:34:50,840 --> 02:34:52,440
I watch a bunch of movies.

2140
02:34:57,100 --> 02:35:01,140
But movies are definitely more fun to watch with friends
rather than by yourself.

2141
02:35:07,220 --> 02:35:14,500
and talk about your thoughts afterwards about things you
liked or what scenes did that sort of thing is super fun

2142
02:35:15,580 --> 02:35:24,540
usually I watch things by myself but you might be right
about this one Kana-chan oh my gosh she's going to jumbo it

2143
02:35:24,540 --> 02:35:29,860
I need to write a review of this movie the moment I get home
you write reviews

2144
02:35:37,820 --> 02:35:48,780
yep i write them down to journal my thoughts things like
which scenes i remember or which actor stood out are you

2145
02:35:48,780 --> 02:35:58,120
gonna write about the twister but today's journaling might
end up being a bit more than just a movie review oh no she's

2146
02:35:58,120 --> 02:36:00,820
gonna write about the twister what do you

2147
02:36:07,080 --> 02:36:09,640
Another 15k for the movie.

2148
02:36:11,380 --> 02:36:12,880
Because I watched it with you.

2149
02:36:13,460 --> 02:36:16,440
I feel like I'm going to end up writing more about my time
with you.

2150
02:36:16,680 --> 02:36:18,640
Just please don't show it to your dad, Kana.

2151
02:36:19,040 --> 02:36:21,020
Just don't let your family see your journal.

2152
02:36:21,420 --> 02:36:22,440
That's all I ask.

2153
02:36:22,900 --> 02:36:24,540
I'd love to read the end result.

2154
02:36:30,800 --> 02:36:34,480
Nope, not even a sentence because it's a secret.

2155
02:36:35,560 --> 02:36:36,120
Oh God.

2156
02:36:36,560 --> 02:36:38,240
Oh my god, it's nighttime!

2157
02:36:38,900 --> 02:36:42,120
She's gonna give me a gift!

2158
02:36:44,660 --> 02:36:46,240
Oh, birthday ticket!

2159
02:36:47,980 --> 02:36:49,900
Is this an invitation to your birthday?

2160
02:36:53,540 --> 02:36:55,380
Her birthday is coming up!

2161
02:37:00,700 --> 02:37:02,720
Wait, what do we get to do on her birthday?

2162
02:37:04,020 --> 02:37:05,920
Why is Doki in the- you know why?

2163
02:37:06,080 --> 02:37:08,320
You know why it's in the raid.

2164
02:37:10,780 --> 02:37:12,180
Thanks, Kana-chan.

2165
02:37:20,170 --> 02:37:22,070
The movie you saw today was amazing.

2166
02:37:22,250 --> 02:37:23,570
Wait, I have to save up for it?

2167
02:37:23,690 --> 02:37:24,550
What do you mean?

2168
02:37:27,630 --> 02:37:28,790

Guys.

2230
02:40:48,710 --> 02:40:53,670
Guys, we lost so much money, but it was all for Kana.

2231
02:40:54,150 --> 02:40:55,430
It was all for Kana.

2232
02:40:55,610 --> 02:40:56,670
The best girl.

2233
02:40:56,930 --> 02:40:57,930
We did it, chat.

2234
02:40:58,230 --> 02:40:59,810
We fucking did it.

2235
02:41:00,170 --> 02:41:01,350
It's okay, guys.

2236
02:41:01,790 --> 02:41:02,450
It's okay.

2237
02:41:02,550 --> 02:41:03,210
We made it.

2238
02:41:03,250 --> 02:41:03,870
We peaked.

2239
02:41:06,370 --> 02:41:08,970
I feel so motivated, chat.

2240
02:41:09,290 --> 02:41:11,710
I feel so fucking motivated now.

2241
02:41:14,170 --> 02:41:17,910
Well, that was, that was an adventure, guys.

2242
02:41:18,110 --> 02:41:19,910
That truly was an adventure.

2243
02:41:22,030 --> 02:41:25,330
I think it was good that we didn't keep going.

2244
02:41:26,150 --> 02:41:30,590
Because I'm worried that I think the mafia was actually
going to go for me if I kept going.

2245
02:41:31,010 --> 02:41:33,510
So, like, we gotta, we gotta know when to quit, you know.

2246
02:41:33,810 --> 02:41:39,350
We gotta, we gotta, we gotta, because, because I think I
like my body organs.

need two kidneys you know chat maybe maybe i do need both my

2250
02:42:07,410 --> 02:42:12,830
for the fucking movie tickets I don't know, guys.

2251
02:42:13,330 --> 02:42:17,950
Like, I thought she was perfect, but then she buys movie
snacks.

2252
02:42:18,770 --> 02:42:19,510
So, like...

2253
02:42:25,510 --> 02:42:27,090
So, I don't know.

2254
02:42:27,350 --> 02:42:29,630
I feel like that's a little bit of a red flag.

2255
02:42:29,810 --> 02:42:30,950
That's a little bit of...

2256
02:42:30,950 --> 02:42:33,670
She buys $100 worth of movie snacks.

2257
02:42:34,010 --> 02:42:37,370
So, like, I feel like it's a little bit of a red flag, guys.

2258
02:42:39,950 --> 02:42:41,390
Echo, thank you for the super chat.

2259
02:42:41,470 --> 02:42:41,670

2261
02:42:42,490 --> 02:42:44,410
Imagine being dead from a gotcha game.

Thank you.

2267
02:42:47,670 --> 02:42:50,130
She bought sort of like $60 worth of movie food.

2268
02:42:50,450 --> 02:42:52,650
And that's like one popcorn and a Coke.

2269
02:42:53,090 --> 02:42:57,090
And like at that point, I feel like, you know, Kana might be
a little too rich for me.

2270
02:42:57,350 --> 02:42:58,170
For my taste.

2271
02:43:03,130 --> 02:43:04,710

Glad to know Doki has the same spending habits we do.

Thank you.

2289
02:43:23,670 --> 02:43:24,750
