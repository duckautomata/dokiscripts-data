00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:50,980
Hello everybody!

2
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,800
Hello, hello!

3
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:55,040
Welcome to the bonus stream!

4
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:01,000
It's a little bit of a super unexpected gorilla stream.

5
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:06,020
Is it really be... Is it really unexpected when I sort of told you guys I was gonna do a gorilla stream anyway?

6
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:15,180
This is more of a chill stream because I wanted to mix it up with the back-to-back Apex streams that we had all of a sudden.

7
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:19,680
So like to make it up to you guys, I decided to just like do a bonus stream today!

8
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:23,360
Do an extra bonus stream and just hang out with you guys.

9
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:26,200
Because both Apex streams, they were both like collabs.

10
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,840
I didn't get to really interact with you guys.

11
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:32,060
I didn't get to talk to you guys or like fuck around a lot with chat.

12
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:35,220
Because I was like super... Well, I was semi-focused.

13
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:36,780
Like, who are we kidding?

14
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,080
I was not super focused on the tournaments.

15
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:44,240
If you cast...

16
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,160
If you invite a call...

17
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:49,360
If you invite a content creator into these tournaments, you're never really super focused.

18
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:51,000
You're not really...

19
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:56,620
Okay, to be fair...

20
00:03:56,620 --> 00:04:00,880
I'm going to practice more Apex though because I don't want to throw...

21
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,280
I don't really...

22
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:07,280
I don't really want to throw the challenger circuit.

23
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:15,160
To be fair, today's tournament was more about like games that were more fucking around than actual Apex.

24
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:15,760
And I'm not even actually serious.

25
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:21,820
Except for the time when Timmy yelled at me 30 seconds straight to fucking use my Q and shield.

26
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:22,460
And then...

27
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:23,360
And then I...

28
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,720
I did not do that.

29
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:25,380
That was...

30
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:26,480
That was a little embarrassing.

31
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:27,880
That was my...

32
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:31,980
That was my moment there.

33
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:33,380
In front of everybody.

34
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,380
Not just to you guys, but to the normies that watched Timmy as well.

35
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,240
That...

36
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,120
That...

37
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:44,470
That...

38
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:44,610
That...

39
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:47,410
I was truly...

40
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:49,450
I was the...

41
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:54,890
I totally left a great impression regarding VTubers to Timmy's audience.

42
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:55,790
Truly...

43
00:04:55,790 --> 00:05:00,850
Truly was the most impact I've ever had towards Timmy's...

44
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:06,230
Towards Timmy's like first impressions of me.

45
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:06,890
Definitely.

46
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:07,630
For sure.

47
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:08,510
For sure.

48
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:11,210
I hope...

49
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:14,150
I hope he still enjoyed the time we had.

50
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:15,910
I hope he still enjoyed the time.

51
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:19,610
Deadpool, thank you for the super chat.

52
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:19,910
Thank you.

53
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:20,350
Thank you.

54
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:22,430
You paid the price for chicken and rice.

55
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:23,490
Thank you for the super chat.

56
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:23,890
Thank you.

57
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:24,410
Thank you.

58
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:26,210
All that for chicken and rice.

59
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:28,230
Guys, I was off my groove.

60
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:30,890
Like...

61
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:34,910
You know, I didn't get to talk the drop before we start the game.

62
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:36,930
Look, I'm gonna make a hundred fucking excuses.

63
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:38,390
Because like...

64
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:42,330
As anyone that plays competitive FPS games before...

65
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:43,810
You never blame yourself.

66
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:45,350
You always blame other people.

67
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:46,270
And...

68
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:50,650
You make a hundred thousand excuses why you were not the problem in the video game.

69
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:51,630
So this was...

70
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:53,050
I'm gonna blame chicken and rice.

71
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:54,690
I'm gonna blame...

72
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:56,210
It messed with my groove.

73
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:58,410
You know, I didn't get the chance to like...

74
00:05:58,410 --> 00:05:59,410
Get to know drop.

75
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:02,030
So I have to get to know him while we were playing.

76
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:03,070
And then...

77
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:05,390
And then I got messed up because we were getting contested.

78
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:07,310
So I didn't realize they were there.

79
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:08,550
And then...

80
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:13,250
Anton, thank you for the super chat.

81
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:13,610
Thank you.

82
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:14,050
Thank you.

83
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:15,710
Thank you for the super chat.

84
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:17,910
And then everything went downhill.

85
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:21,270
All because of chicken and rice.

86
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:24,250
Every game after that went downhill.

87
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:28,750
It broke everything.

88
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:30,350
It fucked with everything.

89
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:33,410
All because of chicken and rice.

90
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:35,910
Every game after that...

91
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:38,050
Got fucked with.

92
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:42,890
Miki, thank you for the super chat.

93
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:43,190
Thank you.

94
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:43,810
Thank you.

95
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:45,650
This is actually a zero copium moment.

96
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:47,130
Even if you didn't see that skin.

97
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:48,510
Thank you for the super chat.

98
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:48,970
Thank you.

99
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:49,550
Thank you.

100
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:51,210
Alex, welcome to tomato farm.

101
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:51,590
Welcome.

102
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:52,110
Welcome.

103
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:59,270
But yeah, I'm definitely gonna be practicing more apex starting tomorrow.

104
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:03,950
Because not only do I have the scars cup.

105
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:06,810
Also, yeah, because I also have the scars cup.

106
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:08,230
And it's a little bit more serious.

107
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:11,430
Because JP people do take like...

108
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:13,950
Like the tournaments I was in today and yesterday.

109
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:15,490
They were really like, you know.

110
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:17,710
We were all like fucking around a lot.

111
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:19,510
And it was all like for fun games.

112
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:22,990
But like the scars cup one is a bit more serious.

113
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:25,990
Um, like there's no like actual...

114
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:27,690
There's no like fun game modes.

115
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:29,150
They're all like...

116
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:31,190
Gotta try.

117
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:36,690
You actually gotta try guys.

118
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:40,130
We have to try.

119
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:43,910
I mean, I do try.

120
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:45,050
I did try today.

121
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:47,150
But I could have tried a little more.

122
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:48,670
I would admit.

123
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:51,670
I could have not tried to get to know Dropz.

124
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:53,690
And like have a conversation with him.

125
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:55,470
I could have just played the game.

126
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:57,950
Instead of having a conversation with Dropz.

127
00:07:57,970 --> 00:08:00,410
But instead I got a little distracted.

128
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:02,490
Tried to have a conversation.

129
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:03,490
And I died.

130
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:05,650
I could have not had a conversation.

131
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:06,810
And just focused.

132
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:09,490
I would admit.

133
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:10,690
I would admit.

134
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:11,410
I would admit.

135
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:15,020
But I wanted to get to know them.

136
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,580
I wanted to get to know them.

137
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:20,260
I don't want it to be like never see you again.

138
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:21,880
Like...

139
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:25,860
Um...

140
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:27,100
Anyway...

141
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:28,000
Um...

142
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,440
After the scars cup we also have challenger circuit.

143
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:32,500
With...

144
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:33,140
Uh...

145
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:34,320
Wig and Tempo.

146
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,540
And I definitely need to try for that.

147
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,160
Thank you for the five gift ships.

148
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:38,660
Thank you.

149
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:39,140
Thank you.

150
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:40,320
Thank you for the super chat.

151
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:40,640
Thank you.

152
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,200
Thank you.

153
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:41,920
Um...

154
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:44,500
Also I have the challenger circuit too.

155
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,160
And those people...

156
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,320
The people we are playing against.

157
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:48,300
They actually scrim.

158
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,440
And for those who don't know what scrimming is.

159
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:53,080
They actually like do like practice games.

160
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:54,400
Uh...

161
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,820
They do practice games.

162
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:56,420
Like...

163
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:57,060
You know...

164
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:58,080
Almost every day.

165
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,160
And then there's me.

166
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:02,840
I don't think I have to explain.

167
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:04,280
I don't have...

168
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,580
I don't think I have to explain more.

169
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,500
When I say...

170
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,260
And then there's me.

171
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:08,420
Um...

172
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:10,400
So I have to be less of a content creator.

173
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:10,620
Um...

174
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,600
And more of a like...

175
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,520
An actual player.

176
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,280
Uh...

177
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:13,660
You know...

178
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:14,160
And so...

179
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:14,660
So...

180
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:14,960
Oh yeah.

181
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:16,240
Also a really funny thing.

182
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,640
After the tournament.

183
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:18,500
Like...

184
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:18,760
Uh...

185
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,400
Jen Burden DM'd me on Twitter.

186
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:23,980
And like he followed me back on Twitter.

187
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:24,980
And he was like...

188
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:26,120
You're so fucking funny.

189
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,620
And honestly...

190
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:29,260
When like...

191
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:29,460
And...

192
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:30,180
Like he was like...

193
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:30,920
You're so fucking funny.

194
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:31,960
I had a great time playing with you.

195
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:32,940
And honestly...

196
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,540
If an Australian said that.

197
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:35,240
You know?

198
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:36,140
If an...

199
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:37,840
I think Australians are really fucking hilarious.

200
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,180
Because like...

201
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:39,780
I like...

202
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:40,280
I like...

203
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,740
I like groove with their sense of humor.

204
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:42,400
And...

205
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,020
I guess they don't...

206
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:45,180
They don't give a fuck.

207
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:46,720
They don't give a...

208
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,760
Australians like...

209
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:54,180
Australians say the wildest things.

210
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,380
And like...

211
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:57,540
Honestly if an Australian says you're...

212
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:58,680
You're really funny.

213
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,260
Like I take that as a fucking compliment.

214
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:05,740
And...

215
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:06,580
And then...

216
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:07,440
I told him.

217
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,220
I was like...

218
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:08,680
I...

219
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:09,880
Okay also by the way...

220
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:10,260
Like...

221
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:13,780
I know I only released like top 10 of who won the most money.

222
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:14,880
And...

223
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:16,880
And like...

224
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,660
And so like...

225
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:19,520
So I...

226
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,480
I know how much money I won.

227
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:24,040
And I won more money than Jen Birden.

228
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,200
I straight up told him.

229
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:26,940
I was like...

230
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:28,020
Oh my god.

231
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,460
I actually made more than...

232
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:30,880
Because like we joked about it.

233
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:31,900
When we had the game.

234
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:32,940
And I was like...

235
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:34,740
I actually made more than you.

236
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:35,400
This tournament.

237
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:37,860
Like I'm practically a pro player now.

238
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,940
And then Jen Birden was like...

239
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:40,240
Wait.

240
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:40,980
I made no shot.

241
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:48,280
And I made more than Jen Birden and Zero from Dark Zero.

242
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,960
Which was fucking funny as hell.

243
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:51,640
I honestly...

244
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,980
I thought it was so fucking funny.

245
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:58,700
I actually made more than Zero and Jen Birden in that tournament.

246
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:03,450
Yeah.

247
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:05,090
So I was like...

248
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:05,490
You know what?

249
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:06,750
I take that as a win.

250
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:07,430
I...

251
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:09,770
I take that as a fucking win.

252
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:10,970
Right there.

253
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:11,830
Man.

254
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:12,890
It's alright.

255
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:14,290
Just Australian things.

256
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:15,590
But I had a great time.

257
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:16,690
It was honestly...

258
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:19,570
Nice to finally...

259
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:24,530
I never played with Jen or Timmy or Dropped before.

260
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:28,770
So like it was definitely an honor to be able to play with them.

261
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:31,170
Even though for Dropped it was like literally one minute.

262
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:31,810
But like...

263
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:36,370
Even though it was only for a minute with Dropped.

264
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:37,130
That's alright.

265
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:39,810
But like Jen and like Timmy.

266
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:41,610
Definitely...

267
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:41,930
Oh yeah.

268
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:43,450
I'll be remembered by Timmy as the...

269
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:46,530
As the new cast of that wouldn't fucking listen.

270
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:49,970
The worst.

271
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:50,990
To be fair.

272
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:51,650
To be fair.

273
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:56,270
He had an actual real team during the other three strikes.

274
00:11:56,370 --> 00:11:59,250
But then he got the same placement as us.

275
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:01,030
So in the end...

276
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:01,190
No.

277
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:02,230
He wouldn't have improved.

278
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:02,890
He...

279
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:06,070
Like whatever teammate he got after me did...

280
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:11,370
It didn't matter because he didn't even improve his placement.

281
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:11,590
I mean...

282
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:12,110
He was just...

283
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:12,230
Like...

284
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:17,050
Those two teammates that he had were 100% better than what like...

285
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:17,470
Like...

286
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:18,010
Like...

287
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:19,070
They were literally pro players.

288
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:22,030
Like he literally had another pro player on his team.

289
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:23,030
And...

290
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:23,950
And...

291
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:26,110
Because of that they still got fifth place.

292
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:27,450
So what does that say?

293
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:28,690
What does that say?

294
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:33,170
I literally play just as well as having another pro player on his team.

295
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:36,630
Except I just don't know the difference between Conduit Q and Shield.

296
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:37,350
Like...

297
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:40,110
I just didn't know the difference between Conduit Q and...

298
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:41,010
Um...

299
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:41,110
Um...

300
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:42,430
And Newcastle Q.

301
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:43,090
Okay?

302
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:44,810
I'm not a professional player.

303
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:45,530
I'm a content creator.

304
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:47,610
How the fuck was I supposed to know?

305
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:48,870
He should have said...

306
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:50,390
Newcastle Q.

307
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:59,250
I was literally waiting for the...

308
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:01,110
For the Conduit Q...

309
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:02,350
The Q incident.

310
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:03,950
I'll never forget it.

311
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:05,550
Also for those who are...

312
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:06,590
Uh...

313
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:08,690
For those who are new here...

314
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:09,050
Um...

315
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:10,070
If you guys didn't know...

316
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:11,010
I got partners.

317
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:11,430
I'm a partner with...

318
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:12,350
GamerSupps!

319
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:13,750
What does that mean?

320
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:14,990
It means like...

321
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:19,730
Not only do I get referral code, but I'm gonna have merch with gamer supps in the future.

322
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:20,530
Um...

323
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:22,250
And we're gonna have an art contest.

324
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:22,970
Uh...

325
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:23,570
To...

326
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:24,230
To...

327
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:25,170
To decide...

328
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:26,770
What the merch is gonna look like.

329
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:27,210
Uh...

330
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:29,450
More details on the merch next week.

331
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:34,270
So you're gonna hear more about the merch stuff next week.

332
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:34,870
Like...

333
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:35,050
Not merch.

334
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:35,230
Sorry.

335
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:37,510
About the art contest next week.

336
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:39,890
And the prize pool is like seven thousand dollars.

337
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:43,850
So, I think we're picking 10 winners.

338
00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:49,670
We're picking 10 winners and the total prize pool is $7,000.

339
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:54,630
So, I'm very very very very very very excited to see all the entries.

340
00:13:54,970 --> 00:14:01,710
But yeah, huge shout out to Gamersupps for sponsoring 5k of the art contest.

341
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:04,830
And I'm putting in an extra 2k in there.

342
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:07,530
Just because I wanted to be able to pick more artists.

343
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:09,410
So, at first it was like...

344
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:15,350
The reason why I sponsored 2k more, like I added my own 2k in there.

345
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:19,590
It's because I wanted to have more chances to pick artists and stuff.

346
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:21,750
And I felt like, you know, I feel like there's going to be a lot of entries.

347
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:25,870
I want to be able to make it possible to be able to, you know, give you guys...

348
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:31,610
Just be able to, you know, give artists more chances to be picked.

349
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:34,570
Especially it's really good for like resume and stuff too.

350
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:37,210
If you're an artist that wants to put in your portfolio.

351
00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:40,010
For like design work and stuff like that.

352
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:43,930
Like if you were able to... if you get chosen, it would be really good for your portfolio and stuff.

353
00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:45,490
And you get money too!

354
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:46,850
And you get money as well.

355
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:49,330
So, it's like a win-win situation.

356
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:50,930
Thank you for the super chat.

357
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:51,270
Thank you.

358
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:51,650
Thank you.

359
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:55,250
Tell me what do these gamersuppositories do?

360
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:56,490
Thank you for the super chat.

361
00:14:56,590 --> 00:14:56,910
Thank you.

362
00:14:56,950 --> 00:14:57,390
Thank you.

363
00:14:58,590 --> 00:15:00,110
I'm not really good at shilling.

364
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:06,530
They sent me a $300...

365
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:08,630
Package.

366
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:10,330
For free.

367
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:11,930
Of like gamersupp stuff.

368
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:13,270
So, okay.

369
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:14,630
They don't... they go in your mouth.

370
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:15,710
By the way, you drink them.

371
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:17,610
It doesn't go anywhere else in any other holes.

372
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:18,810
You drink these.

373
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:20,250
It's powder.

374
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:22,410
That you put in your drink.

375
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:23,510
And then you put water.

376
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:27,350
Also, apparently the gamersupps like snack bars are really good.

377
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:28,930
I haven't had a chance to try it out.

378
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:31,270
But it was in that package that was sent.

379
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:32,410
And...

380
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:35,430
Because...

381
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:35,890
Okay.

382
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:36,530
You know what?

383
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:36,970
Clarify.

384
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:38,290
Because he said suppositories.

385
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:38,910
Like...

386
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:44,430
If you don't know what suppositories are, you have to specify where it's going to.

387
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:45,870
Anyway.

388
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:47,290
Anyway.

389
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:51,950
I was recommending flavors earlier on in the Apex streams.

390
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:52,670
And I...

391
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:53,610
The current ones...

392
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:56,450
I haven't tried all of them because it was a lot.

393
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:57,050
Okay.

394
00:15:57,110 --> 00:15:57,970
It was a lot.

395
00:15:58,190 --> 00:15:59,330
But there's...

396
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:02,850
The two ones I really like so far is the melon one.

397
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:04,450
I'm not going to read out the actual names.

398
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:05,730
Because like...

399
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:08,670
Apparently, people were telling me to try the guacamole one.

400
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:12,010
Because apparently the guacamole one is actually really really good.

401
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:15,330
But I haven't tried the guacamole one because of the name.

402
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:16,290
The actual name...

403
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:16,730
I don't know.

404
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:18,730
The name doesn't really appeal to me.

405
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:24,840
Like...

406
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,060
Everyone is like, it's legit really good.

407
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:29,840
You have to try that one.

408
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,080
This one's the best flavor.

409
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,140
But like...

410
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:33,960
But the name though...

411
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:34,480
Like...

412
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,480
The name though...

413
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:40,620
It's like in the sample pack too.

414
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:41,540
Like...

415
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:45,380
I looked at the sample pack because I didn't want to like...

416
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:47,400
I was lazy when it comes...

417
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:47,820
Because like...

418
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:51,740
There's one, you know, the actual powder stuff where you get a spoon and put it in.

419
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:52,560
But like...

420
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,000
I'm lazy.

421
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:53,820
I don't want to measure.

422
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,000
So like...

423
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,960
I've been like using the sample pack that they gave me as well.

424
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:01,440
You know, there's like the ones with the actual bins.

425
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:04,460
And then there's the sample pack they gave you that has like...

426
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:07,420
You just rip it and then you pour all of it contents in there.

427
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,600
And then...

428
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:09,720
I got...

429
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:12,280
I didn't want to get a spoon and measure it.

430
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,200
So I've been using the sample pack.

431
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,380
And in the sample pack, they have the guacamole one.

432
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:20,160
And I won't say the full name because like...

433
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,140
I can't.

434
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:22,120
I can't guys.

435
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:23,400
I can't.

436
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:24,200
I can't.

437
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,340
I'm like...

438
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:26,560
I can't.

439
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,660
I'm a coward.

440
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:33,580
I can't.

441
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:34,260
I am.

442
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,420
I'm a coward.

443
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:37,940
But anyway...

444
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:40,820
Breezy, thank you for the super chat.

445
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:41,280
Thank you.

446
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:41,740
Thank you.

447
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:43,480
But when is the review of the guacamole?

448
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,760
I haven't tried it yet.

449
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:45,560
I have...

450
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,940
I can't.

451
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:49,440
I...

452
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,920
Oh my god.

453
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:56,700
Literally, I've tried every flavor in the sample pack but that flavor.

454
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:59,040
And everyone says it's the best one.

455
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,860
They all said it's the best one.

456
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:03,560
And I'm like...

457
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:03,760
I can't.

458
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,540
I can't.

459
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,100
I can't.

460
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:08,080
I can't.

461
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:08,420
I can't.

462
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:09,940
I can't.

463
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:10,140
I can't.

464
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,300
I can't.

465
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,140
I can't.

466
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:14,380
I can't.

467
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:15,880
I can't.

468
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,360
I can't.

469
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,220
I can't.

470
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:19,200
I can't.

471
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,040
I can't.

472
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:20,580
I can't.

473
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:21,000
I can't.

474
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:21,120
I can't.

475
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:21,180
I can't.

476
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:22,220
I can't.

477
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:22,880
I can't.

478
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:23,100
I can't.

479
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:23,160
I can't.

480
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:23,880
I can't.

481
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:24,880
I can't.

482
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:26,500
I can't.

483
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,340
Tell me how that tastes, chat!

484
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:34,460
Oh my god.

485
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:34,940
You know what?

486
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:36,620
Maybe I am great at shilling stuff.

487
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,280
Viva, thank you for the super chat.

488
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,000
Thank you, thank you.

489
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:43,220
If I win the art contest, can I get my money in Canadian tire money?

490
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,640
Thank you for the super chat.

491
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:45,920
Thank you, thank you.

492
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:47,220
Lory Corrosus.

493
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:48,400
Guacamole.

494
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:49,100
Say it, doki.

495
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:49,560
Say it.

496
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:50,520
Thank you for the super chat.

497
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:51,420
Thank you, thank you.

498
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:51,960
Zonderman.

499
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:53,500
Not very good at Googling.

500
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:55,840
Can you say the full name in Pig Latin for me?

501
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:56,580
Thank you for the super chat.

502
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:57,140
Thank you, thank you.

503
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:58,160
You know what you can do?

504
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:01,660
You can click on my link and just search up guacamole.

505
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,500
That's all you have to do.

506
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:07,260
That's all you have to do, guys.

507
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:09,560
Just search up guacamole.

508
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:11,860
Okay.

509
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:12,620
Anyway.

510
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:13,380
By the way.

511
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,640
One other shill thing.

512
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:16,600
The Lunar New Year merch is...

513
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:19,620
Pre-order is next... next week.

514
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:22,720
So make sure you grab it before it's gone.

515
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:24,480
Because everything but the...

516
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,820
But the red pocket...

517
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,020
The red pocket will be gone forever.

518
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:27,820
So...

519
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:29,240
So like...

520
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:34,020
If you guys want to grab some merch, some limited merch, make sure you get the Lunar New Year merch.

521
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,720
When will there be new merch?

522
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:40,300
I'm trying to wait until I send my first shipment of merch.

523
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:42,720
I haven't received my... our first...

524
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,280
Like the debut...

525
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:47,020
The old debut merch yet.

526
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:51,280
So the reason why there hasn't been any new... anything new in the store...

527
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,780
Or like anything...

528
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:55,600
I guess like other than that, I am planning on one day...

529
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,300
Releasing voice packs one day.

530
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:01,420
One day because there's so many things to do.

531
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:05,820
I'm so behind on so many things.

532
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,280
But like...

533
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:11,840
The reason why there's going to be a little hiatus with merch...

534
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,480
New merch orders...

535
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,600
Like not new merch orders, sorry.

536
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:15,340
New...

537
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:22,920
Merch releases is because I want to be sure that I've settled with the debut stuff first.

538
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,560
Like I shipped those out first.

539
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:25,700
Before...

540
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:29,060
Like I received them and shipped them out first before I think of new merch.

541
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:34,380
Just because like I don't want to like have like a bunch of stuff that's been on hold.

542
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:34,880
You know?

543
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,640
And everybody's like, where is our merch?

544
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:40,000
We've been buying merch for like three...

545
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:40,620
Four...

546
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:42,080
Three to four drops now.

547
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:43,740
Where is it?

548
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:44,780
And I'm like, please.

549
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,280
I'm still waiting on the...

550
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,500
It's on the fucking ocean.

551
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,140
It's on a ship.

552
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,740
And I'm still waiting.

553
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:53,760
Because it takes so long to travel and water.

554
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:57,320
It's like...

555
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:01,280
I have to wait like two months for the merch to arrive to me.

556
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:02,780
It's so long.

557
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:04,380
Bro.

558
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,600
Oh my god.

559
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:07,860
One time.

560
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:08,540
Okay.

561
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:09,180
This is recently.

562
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:10,000
Not one time.

563
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:10,740
Like right now.

564
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:11,620
Bro.

565
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:12,300
Okay.

566
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,140
So like one of my packages...

567
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:17,160
Because remember when I said I ordered like 50 at first to prepare?

568
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,100
Because I thought only 50 of you guys are going to buy my merch.

569
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:21,220
So like I ordered...

570
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:23,640
I pre-ordered 50 at first.

571
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:24,380
Because I was like...

572
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:25,800
How many people are going to buy my merch?

573
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:26,700
Maybe 50 people.

574
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:30,380
And it's been stuck in customs.

575
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,820
It's been stuck in customs.

576
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:38,520
And I have to go to the customs office to like unstuck it.

577
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,120
It's so fucked up.

578
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,580
And then I was like...

579
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:42,760
I was like...

580
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:45,140
Hey, can I like call...

581
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:45,700
Because they were like...

582
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:47,100
They emailed me and was like...

583
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:53,280
Hey, you have your package and like we need you to sign these forms.

584
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,640
And like do this.

585
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:56,700
And then I was like...

586
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,060
Okay, here's my information.

587
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,340
Because they needed one thing.

588
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:00,940
And then they replied back.

589
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:01,940
And they were like...

590
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:02,880
Never mind.

591
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:03,980
Go to their office.

592
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:04,880
And then I...

593
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,360
To settle all of this.

594
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:08,140
And then I was like...

595
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:09,500
Hey...

596
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:10,460
Um...

597
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:11,620
Where...

598
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:12,360
What?

599
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,400
First off...

600
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:19,780
Where the fuck is this office that I have to go to?

601
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,660
Like I was like...

602
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:22,880
What does that mean?

603
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:24,460
They're like...

604
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:25,780
Go to the office.

605
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:27,600
Like go to like this...

606
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,540
The customs office.

607
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:29,300
And I'm like...

608
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:30,480
Where the fuck is...

609
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,860
Where is the customs office?

610
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:32,540
Where?

611
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,640
And then they were like...

612
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:35,380
I was like...

613
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:36,300
Hey, I'm confused.

614
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:37,800
Um...

615
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,020
I've never done this before.

616
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:41,200
And can you give me this information?

617
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,180
Like what do I do?

618
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,600
Like who do I call?

619
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,460
And then they were like...

620
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:47,400
You can't call them.

621
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:48,740
Go to their office.

622
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:50,020
And I was like...

623
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:50,720
Um...

624
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,860
Where is the office?

625
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:56,200
And they gave me the address.

626
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:58,560
And then I looked it up.

627
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:03,400
The worst part was that I looked it up.

628
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,040
And they're closed.

629
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:11,520
They're closed on like Fridays to Mondays because it's a Canadian...

630
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,780
It's Easter.

631
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:15,780
It's fucking Easter.

632
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:19,240
So I can't do anything about it.

633
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,560
I was just like...

634
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:22,280
And then like the manufacturer...

635
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:22,840
They were like...

636
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:24,000
The manufacturer got back to me.

637
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:27,020
It was like a back to forth with them.

638
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:28,540
And then I was like freaking out.

639
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:32,080
And then the manufacturer got back to me and was like...

640
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,800
Hey, what the fuck is going on?

641
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:34,420
Like...

642
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:36,500
Um...

643
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:41,700
You're supposed to pay the custom taxes by the end of this month.

644
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:42,260
You're supposed to pay the custom taxes by the end of this month.

645
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:43,060
What's going on?

646
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:45,300
And I was like, by the end of this month?

647
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,440
Bro!

648
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:47,740
It's not!

649
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:48,740
It's Easter!

650
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:55,020
What do you mean?

651
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:56,380
By the end of...

652
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:57,580
It's Easter!

653
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:00,760
How am I... I can't even call them!

654
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:06,660
I was just like...

655
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:08,300
How do I even call?

656
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,080
They don't even take calls!

657
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:11,940
And I was like...

658
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:14,840
The guy literally said...

659
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:15,860
In the email...

660
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:17,240
They don't take calls.

661
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:19,680
What do you mean?

662
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:21,840
They don't take calls!

663
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:23,640
I was just like...

664
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,940
I can't even call them?

665
00:24:26,410 --> 00:24:28,120
I have to be there?

666
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:29,780
And then...

667
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,420
And then...

668
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:34,780
And then I told the manufacturer...

669
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:35,740
I was like...

670
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:37,180
I don't know what to do.

671
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:38,960
They don't take calls.

672
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:41,100
Look at their office hours.

673
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:42,840
They're closed.

674
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,580
And then they're like...

675
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:48,720
Okay, we're gonna...

676
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:49,260
figure this out.

677
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:50,200
And they're like...

678
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,560
Oh, we got you an extension.

679
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,980
We extended it to Monday.

680
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:55,300
And I was like...

681
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:55,980
Monday?

682
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:57,900
It's still Easter!

683
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:01,560
I was just like...

684
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:03,900
What the fuck did I suggest Monday?

685
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:06,340
It's not gonna be open!

686
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:08,360
It's still Easter!

687
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:11,980
I was just like...

688
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:13,860
I was just like...

689
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:15,600
Bro, it's still closed!

690
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,800
And then...

691
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:18,720
I was like...

692
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,460
I replied back and I was like...

693
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:24,640
The office is still closed on Monday.

694
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:25,880
I don't know what...

695
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:27,780
Can you give me Tuesday?

696
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:29,820
I literally was like...

697
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,000
Um...

698
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:32,140
Can you...

699
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:34,160
Can you give me Tuesday?

700
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:37,520
The office is still closed on Monday.

701
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,700
Because it's Easter.

702
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:42,000
I was so confused.

703
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:42,940
I was like...

704
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:43,980
Don't worry.

705
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:45,580
We extended it.

706
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,740
I was like...

707
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:47,760
To what?

708
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:49,280
It's still closed!

709
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:50,620
Like...

710
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:53,160
I can't...

711
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,360
I just can't believe it.

712
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,820
I know I'm repeating myself.

713
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,080
But it actually blew my mind.

714
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,460
That they were so...

715
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:02,780
generous enough...

716
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:04,840
to extend it to Monday...

717
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:06,740
when it's still closed.

718
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,860
It was...

719
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:13,340
It was so generous, guys.

720
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,500
They extended it...

721
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,540
to a date where I still can't visit...

722
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:18,200
the office.

723
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:20,000
I quit.

724
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:21,000
I was just...

725
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,500
I didn't know what to do.

726
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:23,640
I was just like...

727
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,280
Tuesday, please?

728
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,960
Anyway, I'm like waiting...

729
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:31,060
for them to get back to me...

730
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:32,380
on whether or not...

731
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:34,940
I mean, what else can they do?

732
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:36,900
If they can't do Tuesday...

733
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:37,540
I don't know.

734
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:39,000
They're not getting my money.

735
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:39,500
I guess.

736
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:42,380
At that point, I don't fucking know.

737
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,340
So yeah.

738
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:50,300
Anyway, happy Easter...

739
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:50,680
everybody.

740
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,120
I hope you guys are having...

741
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,020
a great Easter.

742
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,580
Everything's closed for me.

743
00:26:57,860 --> 00:26:59,640
But I hope you guys...

744
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:01,620
are having a better Easter...

745
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:02,680
than I am.

746
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:03,440
Apparently.

747
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:08,380
That's basically...

748
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:10,440
how my life is...

749
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:11,100

757
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:23,420

758
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,000

759
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:24,580

760
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:25,560

00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:28,320
I told you guys before.

764
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:29,920
My...

765
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:30,920
My real form.

766
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,240
I still have my hat.

767
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,620
I can put on a hat.

768
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:34,620
Yeah.

769
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:35,620
I didn't know you...

770
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:37,260
I told you guys about this.

771
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:40,260
I just don't know where my hat is right now.

772
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:42,140
I didn't...

773
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:44,260
I need to ask my creator.

774
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:46,520
The one who birthed me.

775
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:47,580
Like...

776
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:48,360
Um...

777
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,820
If they can like...

778
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:54,060
find my hat... remake my hat.

779
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:56,340
Or find my hat.

780
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:57,560
I actually lost my hat.

781
00:27:57,660 --> 00:27:58,520
I don't know where it is.

782
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,480
I actually don't know where my hat is.

783
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:02,120
But yes, I... I can...

784
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,600
Of course I can wear a hat.

785
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:04,380
It's a fucking hat.

786
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:05,800
Like, what do you mean?

787
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,400
You think the hat is glued to my skull?

788
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:10,240
I say as I can take off my hat on my skin suit.

789
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:11,820
Um... This one is.

790
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,200
This hat is glued to my...

791
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:16,340
This hat is glued to my...

792
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:17,080
Just so you guys know.

793
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,420
This hat is glued to my skin suit.

794
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:20,340
It's like sewed in.

795
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:21,940
Because like I'm wearing a skin suit.

796
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:24,280
So this one is like glued slash...

797
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:26,760
sewed in... into my skin suit.

798
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:27,840
But like...

799
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:28,920
I have multiple hats.

800
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:31,560
I have like a collection of hats.

801
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,120
And uh...

802
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:35,740
In my real form, I can wear that hat.

803
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:37,140
I just don't know where it is.

804
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:38,580
That specific hat.

805
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:39,600
I don't know where it is.

806
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:44,180
Um...

807
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:45,800

809
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:46,680
Thank you.

810
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:49,820
Um... Hey, I have a serious question, Hey, I have a serious question, Dragons.

811
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:52,380
What game should I get my roommates to play?

812
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:55,600
As homies, as bros, as amigos, As ya know.

813
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,680
Um... As a bro?

814
00:28:58,560 --> 00:28:59,020
Um...

815
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:01,600
Um...

816
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:03,080
Apex.

817
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:06,600
Bro, I don't fucking know.

818
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:09,520
Bro, I don't fucking know.

819
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:15,240
You should play any type of game.

820
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:16,880
You should play any type of game.

821
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:17,340
You should play any type of game.

822
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:17,380
You should play any type of game.

823
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:22,200
Like Monopoly, Or like It Takes Two, Which is not a board game.

824
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:27,100
Any type of board game.

825
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:29,020
If you don't want them to be your friend anymore.

826
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:31,000
Um... Mario Party.

827
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:31,560
Exactly.

828
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:32,360
Mario Party.

829
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:33,480
Stuff like that.

830
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,640
If you still want to be their friend...

831
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,520
Oh yeah!

832
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,320
If you don't want them to be your friend anymore.

833
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,480
Also play that cooking...

834
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,540
Play it up.

835
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,220
Play it up.

836
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:45,520
That ruins relationships.

837
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:46,860
That's true.

838
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:48,900
Thank you for the super chat.

839
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:49,260
Thank you.

840
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:49,760
Thank you.

841
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:53,060
Not to throw more on your plate, but are you still planning on opening a PO Box?

842
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,900
Also congrats on the gamer sub sponsorship.

843
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:56,480
Also congrats on the gamer sub sponsorship.

844
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:58,320
Uh... GamerNade flavored.

845
00:29:58,640 --> 00:29:58,900
When?

846
00:29:59,080 --> 00:29:59,780
Thank you for the super chat.

847
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:00,080
Thank you.

848
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:00,420
Thank you.

849
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,280
Good question!

850
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:07,400
So the reason why the PO Box is still not open yet, Is because, um...

851
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,500
Mr. Man is opening a PO Box right now.

852
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:11,820
And...

853
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:13,340
Um... He recently moved.

854
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:15,100
And... Um...

855
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:18,140
We were dealing with the PO Box stuff.

856
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:21,340
And the reason why it's not open yet, Is because...

857
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:23,520
Um... Apparently the PO Box place...

858
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:27,200
Um... They require Mr. Man to be on a lease.

859
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:28,340
And...

860
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:28,820
I don't even...

861
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:30,680
Wait... Is he doing... Okay wait.

862
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:33,760
Um...

863
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,060
He is legally living somewhere.

864
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,020
Uh...

865
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:38,560
He's just... They're just...

866
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:40,160
Working on his lease right now.

867
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:41,140
Just so you guys know.

868
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:42,000
He's not living...

869
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,520
He's not living anywhere illegally.

870
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:44,840
Just so you guys know.

871
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:45,460
Like...

872
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:51,100
I didn't realize when I said that...

873
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:52,840
It sounded really bad.

874
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:55,320
It sounded really...

875
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:55,940
Okay.

876
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:58,920
Anyway... He is currently...

877
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:00,040
Cause he's like...

878
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:02,080
Rooming roommates with people.

879
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:05,400
So he is currently working on his lease at the moment.

880
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:06,600
So the moment...

881
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:08,160
He is on the lease.

882
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:10,000
He can open the PO Box.

883
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:12,420
Um... So do not worry.

884
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:13,880
He is living somewhere.

885
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:15,020
Very legal.

886
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:18,360
It's just that it takes time to be on...

887
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:20,680
I don't know how American... I hope I didn't fuck him.

888
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,120
I don't know how American living scenarios are.

889
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:30,220
But...

890
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:36,000
They're working on it.

891
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:39,460
The moment he is on the lease...

892
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:40,440
Um...

893
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:42,720
We will have the PO Box open.

894
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:44,900
That is what we're waiting on at the moment.

895
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:46,260
That is...

896
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:48,420
That is what we're working on.

897
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,300
And like... I asked him.

898
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:51,020
I was like...

899
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:52,800
How long does the lease take?

900
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:55,220
And I also asked his roommate.

901
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:56,700
Because like...

902
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:58,720
You know... Just in case.

903
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:05,760
Just in case.

904
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:06,960
And like...

905
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:08,720
The roommate said...

906
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,020
It would be like... It's like...

907
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:10,600
Don't worry.

908
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,820
Everything is going on track.

909
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,040
It would be...

910
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:17,280
It would be done either by the end of the month.

911
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,300
By this month.

912
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:19,080
End of this month.

913
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:23,080
Or beginning of the week for next month.

914
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:23,900
So...

915
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,800
So we're just waiting on that.

916
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:27,800
And in the moment he is on the lease...

917
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,660
We have our PO Box.

918
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:32,360
Because...

919
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:33,380
You're sending...

920
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:35,400
Remember... I'm telling... I'm reminding you guys this.

921
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:39,240
Is where Mr. Man lives.

922
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,460
And like...

923
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:42,380
So...

924
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:44,360
Near... Yeah...

925
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:45,400
So... It's...

926
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:48,760
I mean... We need his lease.

927
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:50,280
Anyway... I was just like...

928
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:51,420
Did I dox Mr. Man?

929
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:52,940
Well... Anyway...

930
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:57,140
Mr. Man is located.

931
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:58,760
And...

932
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:05,540
And...

933
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,080
And...

934
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:10,160
It's where he's located.

935
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,860
And because of that...

936
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:13,660
Um...

937
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:16,520
You're sending stuff to where he's located.

938
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,580

Check it.

940
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:20,380

971
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:08,120

979
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:20,360

982
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,860

Like as an official convention guest.

1124
00:38:55,290 --> 00:38:55,610
You know?

1125
00:38:55,790 --> 00:38:57,850
Like as a guest at the convention.

1126
00:38:58,350 --> 00:39:00,130
And uh...

1127
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:02,630
Be able to meet you guys.

1128
00:39:02,870 --> 00:39:04,550
I really do hope so in the future.

1129
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:05,930
Uh but yeah.

1130
00:39:06,130 --> 00:39:07,030
That was fun.

1131
00:39:07,410 --> 00:39:08,670
It was fun though.

1132
00:39:08,730 --> 00:39:10,450
Being able to talk to all the artists and stuff.

1133
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:12,730
I still can't believe my stuff sold out.

1134
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:14,230
I can't believe it.

1135
00:39:14,390 --> 00:39:15,550
I was so surprised.

1136
00:39:15,950 --> 00:39:16,570
You know?

1137
00:39:16,710 --> 00:39:18,310
Cause like I'm not under any company or anything.

1138
00:39:18,490 --> 00:39:19,210
I'm just me.

1139
00:39:21,570 --> 00:39:23,570
I'm just me.

1140
00:39:23,830 --> 00:39:26,270
I'm just little old like...

1141
00:39:26,270 --> 00:39:27,490
Little Doki.

1142
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:29,170
Like all...

1143
00:39:29,170 --> 00:39:29,390
All...

1144
00:39:31,650 --> 00:39:33,510
Little old Indie Doki.

1145
00:39:33,650 --> 00:39:35,250
Trying to make it in the...

1146
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:36,310
No I mean I figured I...

1147
00:39:36,310 --> 00:39:37,410
I've made it before.

1148
00:39:37,610 --> 00:39:38,890
But like you know what I mean.

1149
00:39:38,950 --> 00:39:42,710
Just trying to survive out there in the Indie world.

1150
00:39:47,490 --> 00:39:48,470
It's always scary.

1151
00:39:48,790 --> 00:39:50,730
It's so scary being Indie.

1152
00:39:50,870 --> 00:39:52,630
Because you have to do so much stuff.

1153
00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:55,030
To be like I guess like relevant.

1154
00:39:55,230 --> 00:39:56,390
In the Indie world.

1155
00:39:57,490 --> 00:40:00,130
You don't have like a company or brand.

1156
00:40:00,350 --> 00:40:01,430
Like under you.

1157
00:40:01,570 --> 00:40:03,270
So then you have to...

1158
00:40:03,270 --> 00:40:04,870
You have to...

1159
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:06,090
Like you know.

1160
00:40:06,450 --> 00:40:09,370
Have a brand that's like...

1161
00:40:09,370 --> 00:40:11,910
Able to survive as a solo.

1162
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:13,270
Like...

1163
00:40:13,270 --> 00:40:14,350
I'm Beyonce.

1164
00:40:22,830 --> 00:40:24,950
You can say I'm Beyonce.

1165
00:40:28,690 --> 00:40:30,390
You did not.

1166
00:40:30,610 --> 00:40:33,090
You did not just call yourself...

1167
00:40:33,090 --> 00:40:33,690
Beyonce.

1168
00:40:35,130 --> 00:40:36,290
No way.

1169
00:40:37,430 --> 00:40:38,230
Okay.

1170
00:40:38,330 --> 00:40:41,030
I aspire to be Beyonce.

1171
00:40:43,110 --> 00:40:43,790
You're right.

1172
00:40:43,870 --> 00:40:44,730
I'm more like...

1173
00:40:44,730 --> 00:40:45,510
Okay you're right.

1174
00:40:47,310 --> 00:40:48,430
What's your name?

1175
00:40:49,010 --> 00:40:51,710
I'm more like the Spice Girls.

1176
00:40:52,190 --> 00:40:53,770
And I'm trying to be...

1177
00:40:53,770 --> 00:40:55,110
I'm trying to be...

1178
00:40:55,110 --> 00:40:56,710
Posh Spice right now.

1179
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:04,120
You're right.

1180
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:05,220
I'm behind.

1181
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:08,160
I'm more like Posh Spice.

1182
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:10,060
Trying to make it out.

1183
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:11,300
Make it in the world.

1184
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:12,840
After the Spice Girls.

1185
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:15,640
After like...

1186
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:18,460
Where's Beckham then?

1187
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:24,840
Oh I want to be Sporty Spice.

1188
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:25,600
But Sporty...

1189
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:27,060
No I don't.

1190
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:29,220
Because nobody remembers Sporty Spice.

1191
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:30,800
What's her name?

1192
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:33,080
What's Sporty Spice's name?

1193
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:34,900
Everyone remembers...

1194
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:37,240
Posh Spice's name because she married...

1195
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:38,320
David Beckham.

1196
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:41,060
But who the fuck is Sporty Spice's name?

1197
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:42,660
That's right.

1198
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:46,180
That's fucking right.

1199
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:47,660
None of you remembered.

1200
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:50,520
But everyone remembers Victoria Beckham.

1201
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:56,860
Everyone remembers...

1202
00:41:56,860 --> 00:41:58,060
Victoria Beckham.

1203
00:41:58,180 --> 00:41:59,220
No one remembers...

1204
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:00,480
fucking Melanie.

1205
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:02,100
Whatever her name is.

1206
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:04,160
And everybody knows Beyonce.

1207
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:06,100
Everyone knows Beyonce.

1208
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:07,560
I don't want to be Melanie.

1209
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:10,260
No one remembers Melanie.

1210
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:13,400
They have...

1211
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:14,420
names.

1212
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:19,280
I like how someone...

1213
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:19,660
was like...

1214
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:20,500
Melanie?

1215
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:23,420
As a question.

1216
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:27,700
You're not even sure of yourself.

1217
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:29,140
That's the worst part.

1218
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:31,760
You're not even sure of yourself.

1219
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:33,120
Of her name.

1220
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:38,400
You remember...

1221
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:40,840
Because I literally googled Spice Girls.

1222
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:43,960
I literally googled Spice Girls.

1223
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:45,740
Because I was like...

1224
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:47,540
Who were all the Spice Girls?

1225
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:54,700
She was a badass.

1226
00:42:55,180 --> 00:42:57,660
You don't even remember her.

1227
00:42:57,660 --> 00:43:00,940
You just remember her as a group.

1228
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:01,400
You don't even remember her as a group.

1229
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:02,880
And that is why...

1230
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,240
I am scared.

1231
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:06,280
That is why...

1232
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:07,940
I am scared.

1233
00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:11,220
Um...

1234
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:13,400
Alright, anyway.

1235
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:15,280
Or maybe because Melanie...

1236
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:16,840
People know Melanie in the UK.

1237
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:18,200
Maybe.

1238
00:43:18,580 --> 00:43:20,940
Alright, what songs has Melanie sang?

1239
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:23,600
What songs...

1240
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:25,860
has Melanie sang...

1241
00:43:25,860 --> 00:43:27,600
that you guys know?

1242
00:43:28,540 --> 00:43:29,920
That you guys...

1243
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:32,760
That you guys...

1244
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:33,140
That you guys remember?

1245
00:43:34,220 --> 00:43:36,240
That's not Spice Girls songs.

1246
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:39,340
That's not Spice Girls songs.

1247
00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:41,520
That's not Spice Girls songs.

1248
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:43,660
I saw someone was like...

1249
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:46,040
I lived in the UK for 8 years.

1250
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:48,480
And I don't even remember her at all.

1251
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:48,900
And I don't even remember her at all.

1252
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:49,380
Oh my God!

1253
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:50,880
No, I don't want to be Justin Timberlake.

1254
00:43:51,140 --> 00:43:51,760
I don't...

1255
00:43:55,340 --> 00:43:55,900
What?

1256
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:57,880
No, I don't want to be it.

1257
00:43:57,980 --> 00:44:00,040
Beyonce is like the most safest...

1258
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:01,000
person out there.

1259
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:03,440
I don't want to be Justin Timberlake right now.

1260
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:05,720
I don't think anybody...

1261
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:07,640
wants to be Justin Timberlake at the moment.

1262
00:44:12,820 --> 00:44:14,320
Beyonce is like...

1263
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:15,440
She is like...

1264
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:16,900
the perfect queen right now.

1265
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:19,100
She is literally like...

1266
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:23,900
Like in a perfect spot at the moment to be a person.

1267
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:29,520
Um...

1268
00:44:30,740 --> 00:44:31,920
Thank you for the super chat.

1269
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:32,540
Thank you, thank you.

1270
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:33,340
Names are useless.

1271
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:35,120
We should all be serial numbers.

1272
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:36,200
What the fuck happened?

1273
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:37,300
Are you guys serial killers?

1274
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:38,600
Thank you for the super chat.

1275
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:39,500
Thank you, thank you.

1276
00:44:39,740 --> 00:44:41,600
What happened to Justin Timberlake?

1277
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:43,340
Well, he like...

1278
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:46,560
Some stuff happened.

1279
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:50,700
So what did JT do?

1280
00:44:55,220 --> 00:44:56,660
Well, there was a book.

1281
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:01,880
That's all I'll say.

1282
00:45:02,220 --> 00:45:03,680
There was a book.

1283
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:13,120
Chris, thank you for the super chat.

1284
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:14,180
Thank you, thank you.

1285
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:15,440
Um...

1286
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:20,660
If I can be a testament to the family's sales, I've been hard at work 100%ing my Doki Shrine.

1287
00:45:20,780 --> 00:45:23,720
And I've now purchased over 12 items from indie vendors.

1288
00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:26,980
I'm indeed my wallet hurts worth.

1289
00:45:27,340 --> 00:45:30,260
But you'll never get a better Doki Shrine than me.

1290
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:32,540
Thank you for the super chat.

1291
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:33,800
Thank you, thank you.

1292
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:36,680
Well, yeah.

1293
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:37,580
That is why...

1294
00:45:37,580 --> 00:45:40,460
That is why I want to be Beyonce.

1295
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,440
She's the safest choice right now.

1296
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:47,960
Or Victoria Beckham.

1297
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:49,480
Because the...

1298
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:51,120
Or Victoria Beckham.

1299
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:54,240
Because like, everyone remembers Victoria.

1300
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:56,460
Everyone remembers Beyonce.

1301
00:45:57,340 --> 00:46:03,660
And like, Victoria was so funny in that one documentary where she was like, I had it rough.

1302
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:08,120
And then David Beckham was like, tell them your dad's car...

1303
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:10,300
Tell them how many cars your dad owns.

1304
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:14,240
I love that video.

1305
00:46:14,380 --> 00:46:15,520
That is actually the fun...

1306
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:17,220
Bro, David Beckham was so real.

1307
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:19,260
He was so fucking real for that.

1308
00:46:21,460 --> 00:46:22,340
Be honest.

1309
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:23,440
Be honest.

1310
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:25,640
What car did your dad drive?

1311
00:46:26,380 --> 00:46:27,460
You guys don't know that?

1312
00:46:27,620 --> 00:46:28,180
Oh my god.

1313
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:28,900
Wait, let me...

1314
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:31,420
Let me send that.

1315
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:31,640
Okay.

1316
00:46:35,020 --> 00:46:35,900
Victoria Beckham.

1317
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:37,520
Working...

1318
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:39,620
Oh yeah, because she was telling people she's working class.

1319
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:42,780
And then David Beckham was like, be honest.

1320
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:49,380
Yeah, he definitely...

1321
00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:51,960
Yeah, he definitely slept on the couch that night.

1322
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:55,920
Thank you for the super chat.

1323
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:56,300
Thank you.

1324
00:46:56,340 --> 00:46:56,820
Thank you.

1325
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:57,560
How was the tournament?

1326
00:46:57,580 --> 00:46:58,980
You had stuff to do and missed it.

1327
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:01,120
Were you ever gay with Nico again?

1328
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:02,140
The show with him was hilarious.

1329
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:02,980
Thank you for the super chat.

1330
00:47:03,100 --> 00:47:03,380
Thank you.

1331
00:47:03,540 --> 00:47:03,880
Thank you.

1332
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:06,800
I think the tournament was really, really fun.

1333
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:09,380
I definitely enjoyed the tournament a lot.

1334
00:47:09,380 --> 00:47:12,540
But I definitely will be tryharding more for next week.

1335
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:14,380
So I'll be practicing more Apex.

1336
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:15,360
Because I was like...

1337
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:17,220
I've been slacking with my practice.

1338
00:47:17,820 --> 00:47:18,700
Because like...

1339
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:21,020
I had a lot of stuff to do.

1340
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:23,760
I had a lot of stuff to do.

1341
00:47:23,860 --> 00:47:25,380
Like back to back to back to back.

1342
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:30,220
But I'm getting a lot of things done recently.

1343
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:33,820
And that... I was like super...

1344
00:47:33,820 --> 00:47:35,740
Like that took up most of my time.

1345
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:38,160
And a lot of the things that took up a lot of my time is like...

1346
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:39,360
I don't have to deal with it anymore.

1347
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:40,620
So like...

1348
00:47:40,620 --> 00:47:42,400
I'll be definitely be practicing more Apex.

1349
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,680
Because the next two tournaments are very...

1350
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:48,000
Are very...

1351
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,540
Actual tryhards.

1352
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:50,480
Actual...

1353
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:51,340
Actual...

1354
00:47:51,340 --> 00:47:52,880
I have to try now.

1355
00:47:52,980 --> 00:47:54,340
I have to actually try.

1356
00:47:58,200 --> 00:47:59,060
But yes.

1357
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:00,200
Also...

1358
00:48:00,820 --> 00:48:01,380
Nico...

1359
00:48:01,380 --> 00:48:03,640
I'm down to play with him in the future one day.

1360
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:05,040
Just cause like...

1361
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:05,680
Right now...

1362
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:06,680
Like the reason why...

1363
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:08,620
I haven't had really much like repeats.

1364
00:48:08,620 --> 00:48:09,520
Unless like...

1365
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:10,600
They reach out to me.

1366
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:12,680
Because I want to try and like...

1367
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:15,800
Interact with as many new people as possible.

1368
00:48:15,940 --> 00:48:16,500
Every new...

1369
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:17,120
Every week.

1370
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:18,300
I don't know what would go me.

1371
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:20,220
Cause we had a fucking long ass game to complete.

1372
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:20,880
But...

1373
00:48:22,140 --> 00:48:25,220
But I'm trying to like reach out to new people.

1374
00:48:25,580 --> 00:48:26,920
Every week to collab with.

1375
00:48:27,100 --> 00:48:28,040
Cause I want to like...

1376
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:28,580
You know...

1377
00:48:28,580 --> 00:48:29,500
Get to know more people.

1378
00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:30,480
And yeah...

1379
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:31,820
I want to have like people to...

1380
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:34,720
Collaborate with in the future with other games.

1381
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:36,120
Any multiplayer games and stuff.

1382
00:48:36,380 --> 00:48:36,820
So...

1383
00:48:36,820 --> 00:48:37,960
Just slowly...

1384
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:39,640
Meeting more and more new people.

1385
00:48:39,740 --> 00:48:40,440
Every week.

1386
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:41,240
That's my goal.

1387
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:43,440
Every week I want to meet a new person.

1388
00:48:44,340 --> 00:48:44,700
Today...

1389
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:46,180
This week I met a lot of new people.

1390
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:46,900
That's for sure.

1391
00:48:47,980 --> 00:48:48,340
But...

1392
00:48:48,340 --> 00:48:49,860
It was great to finally play with Jen.

1393
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:51,340
I do want to say like...

1394
00:48:51,340 --> 00:48:52,600
I've always wanted to play with Timmy.

1395
00:48:52,660 --> 00:48:53,620
I've always wanted to play with Jen.

1396
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:54,960
And...

1397
00:48:55,540 --> 00:48:56,320
Cause they're like...

1398
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:57,560
Apex streamers I've watched.

1399
00:48:57,780 --> 00:48:58,220
You know...

1400
00:48:58,220 --> 00:48:59,160
Even back in the day.

1401
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:00,780
I watched like Timmy.

1402
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:01,760
And...

1403
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:03,960
Jen a lot back in the day.

1404
00:49:04,300 --> 00:49:05,100
And so...

1405
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:06,520
It was nice to be able to play with them.

1406
00:49:06,660 --> 00:49:07,600
It was definitely a...

1407
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:07,940
A big help.

1408
00:49:07,940 --> 00:49:08,500
And...

1409
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:08,620
I...

1410
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:10,140
Dream come true.

1411
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:10,900
Type deal.

1412
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:12,200
Cause...

1413
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:12,940
Oh my god!

1414
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:13,660
Speaking of!

1415
00:49:13,780 --> 00:49:14,720
Okay, this is like...

1416
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:15,680
A different topic.

1417
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:16,760
But like...

1418
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:18,640
Um...

1419
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:19,420
Um...

1420
00:49:19,420 --> 00:49:21,100
I actually had like...

1421
00:49:21,100 --> 00:49:21,560
Uh...

1422
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:22,620
One of my...

1423
00:49:22,620 --> 00:49:23,960
Super old friends.

1424
00:49:24,100 --> 00:49:25,880
I haven't talked to this person in a long...

1425
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:26,960
Long long long long long long time.

1426
00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:28,600
But they were one of my...

1427
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:28,940
Like...

1428
00:49:28,940 --> 00:49:31,060
Friends that I first made playing Overwatch.

1429
00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:33,860
They used to be like a big Overwatch content creator.

1430
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:35,280
And like...

1431
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:36,240
They reached out to me.

1432
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:36,920
And was like...

1433
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:37,900
Do you want to try out...

1434
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:37,920
Like...

1435
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:39,500
Do you want to go back to Overwatch?

1436
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:40,220
And like...

1437
00:49:40,220 --> 00:49:40,640
You know...

1438
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:41,080
Play?

1439
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:42,360
And I was like...

1440
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:43,460
First off...

1441
00:49:43,460 --> 00:49:44,020
And like...

1442
00:49:44,020 --> 00:49:44,280
Oh yeah!

1443
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:47,320
He wanted me to come back to Overwatch and try out the Faceit.

1444
00:49:47,380 --> 00:49:48,120
And Overwatch.

1445
00:49:48,420 --> 00:49:49,840
For those who don't know...

1446
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:50,120
Um...

1447
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:51,880
Overwatch League is gone now.

1448
00:49:52,220 --> 00:49:54,600
And now they established Faceit.

1449
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:55,360
Uh...

1450
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:57,240
Which is like the new Overwatch League...

1451
00:49:57,240 --> 00:49:57,980
System?

1452
00:49:58,100 --> 00:49:58,580
I think?

1453
00:49:58,740 --> 00:49:59,080
I think?

1454
00:49:59,140 --> 00:49:59,620
I'm not sure.

1455
00:49:59,740 --> 00:50:00,300
I don't know.

1456
00:50:00,460 --> 00:50:02,500
I know like Faceit is like a CSGO thing.

1457
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:03,320
But...

1458
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:05,440
They made a Faceit for Overwatch Rank?

1459
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:07,480
Isn't that for Overwatch Rank?

1460
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:07,900
I don't know.

1461
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:09,840
They made a Faceit for Overwatch.

1462
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:11,480
And they like...

1463
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:12,080
Messaged me...

1464
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:13,260
They like DM me about it.

1465
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:14,000
And was like...

1466
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:14,980
We should do it.

1467
00:50:15,020 --> 00:50:15,220
We're...

1468
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:16,000
And I was like...

1469
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:16,760
I'm fucking...

1470
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:22,100
And then...

1471
00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:23,740
And then I was like...

1472
00:50:24,660 --> 00:50:25,220
Bro...

1473
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:26,400
Bro...

1474
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:27,660
I'm fucking washed!

1475
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:30,240
I don't even have Ilari!

1476
00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:32,060
Or like...

1477
00:50:32,060 --> 00:50:33,560
Life Weaver unlocked!

1478
00:50:33,740 --> 00:50:35,020
Like what the fuck?

1479
00:50:37,060 --> 00:50:38,180
And then he said...

1480
00:50:38,180 --> 00:50:39,060
Bro...

1481
00:50:39,060 --> 00:50:39,600
LeMah...

1482
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:39,640
I don't even have Ilari!

1483
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:39,960
Wow!

1484
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:41,580
I'm fucking washed bro!

1485
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:42,600
What the fuck?

1486
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:45,600
And then they were like...

1487
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:46,180
No man!

1488
00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:46,940
It'll be fun!

1489
00:50:47,340 --> 00:50:49,180
So I haven't responded back after that.

1490
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:50,980
But I think about it.

1491
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:53,000
I think about it.

1492
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,760
I think about it.

1493
00:50:58,360 --> 00:50:59,180
There's always...

1494
00:50:59,180 --> 00:51:00,300
I'm not giving...

1495
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:05,580
Overwatch has too much of my money because back then I was a young fool.

1496
00:51:06,020 --> 00:51:08,040
Back then I was young.

1497
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:08,440
Now!

1498
00:51:15,020 --> 00:51:15,740
Now!

1499
00:51:16,420 --> 00:51:19,560
Now I'm not spending money on Overwatch!

1500
00:51:20,100 --> 00:51:31,940
You need to know, I had so many Overwatch... the amount of money I gave Overwatch in name changes and accounts and loot boxes was way too many.

1501
00:51:31,940 --> 00:51:34,420
I am not fucking buying Ilari.

1502
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:38,580
I'm not buying to unlock Ilari and Life Weaver.

1503
00:51:39,620 --> 00:51:42,760
I'll fucking play the game and unlock them if I have to.

1504
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:44,140
And it's 100 games.

1505
00:51:44,340 --> 00:51:45,620
You need to play 50 games.

1506
00:51:45,820 --> 00:51:46,780
You know what I didn't realize?

1507
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:49,300
Do you know what I didn't fucking realize?

1508
00:51:49,740 --> 00:51:57,580
You need to like... to unlock a character, you have to click on the character and then you have to click unlock.

1509
00:51:58,180 --> 00:52:01,860
Like you have to be like... you have to click on the character and do like... do the challenge.

1510
00:52:01,940 --> 00:52:03,440
For that character.

1511
00:52:03,700 --> 00:52:14,600
So cause I thought... I thought when you play games it automatically registers as like what the character... the support character.

1512
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:23,320
I didn't realize you have to click on the hero and then click... you do the challenges for those heroes.

1513
00:52:23,660 --> 00:52:26,760
Cause I was like oh man I did 20 games.

1514
00:52:27,180 --> 00:52:27,580
Yay!

1515
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:31,180
And then I clicked on Ilari and it said 0 out of 50.

1516
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:39,700
I was like yay!

1517
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:43,460
I did 20 games of Overwatch.

1518
00:52:43,940 --> 00:52:46,280
I was like... okay I didn't know it was 20.

1519
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:47,100
I was like yay!

1520
00:52:47,460 --> 00:52:49,200
I played a lot of games of Overwatch.

1521
00:52:49,540 --> 00:52:52,700
I wonder how many games I have left to unlock Ilari.

1522
00:52:53,100 --> 00:52:54,260
I clicked on it.

1523
00:52:54,300 --> 00:52:55,420
0 out of 50.

1524
00:52:55,860 --> 00:53:03,530
It was... 0 out of fucking 50.

1525
00:53:03,990 --> 00:53:05,270
I was not happy.

1526
00:53:05,270 --> 00:53:06,990
I was not fucking happy.

1527
00:53:10,390 --> 00:53:15,210
And then I clicked on it and then I saw... I saw the number go up.

1528
00:53:15,450 --> 00:53:17,790
I saw the number go up after that.

1529
00:53:18,370 --> 00:53:21,710
Uh... plastic thank you for the magenta soup but thank you thank you.

1530
00:53:21,730 --> 00:53:23,890
Overwatch 2 changing the heroes to be all free.

1531
00:53:24,070 --> 00:53:26,770
No need to unlock for season 10 if I remember correctly.

1532
00:53:27,050 --> 00:53:28,930
Thank you for the magenta soup but thank you...

1533
00:53:28,930 --> 00:53:30,890
Oh my god wait when is season...

1534
00:53:31,850 --> 00:53:34,550
When is season... there's season... it's already season 10?

1535
00:53:35,750 --> 00:53:38,150
Didn't the game come out last year?

1536
00:53:39,010 --> 00:53:41,190
We're already on season 10?

1537
00:53:41,670 --> 00:53:45,730
Holy fuck we're gonna run out of fucking cosmetics.

1538
00:53:46,550 --> 00:53:47,170
Like...

1539
00:53:48,970 --> 00:53:51,950
What the fuck we're already on season 10.

1540
00:53:52,410 --> 00:53:53,390
Jesus Christ.

1541
00:53:53,930 --> 00:53:56,870
Bro I was looking at like the icons again.

1542
00:53:58,050 --> 00:53:59,430
That's just...

1543
00:54:00,370 --> 00:54:05,150
Not gonna lie no wonder like they changed up the rewards.

1544
00:54:05,150 --> 00:54:08,330
By the way Overwatch sponsored me and I'll...

1545
00:54:08,330 --> 00:54:10,710
I won't talk like this about Overwatch.

1546
00:54:14,710 --> 00:54:16,730
I love Overwatch.

1547
00:54:17,150 --> 00:54:18,770
Cause you guys started my career.

1548
00:54:19,350 --> 00:54:20,030
Um... anyway.

1549
00:54:20,290 --> 00:54:23,050
Um... anyway as I was saying...

1550
00:54:23,050 --> 00:54:25,610
As I was saying...

1551
00:54:28,150 --> 00:54:30,570
As... as I was saying...

1552
00:54:31,830 --> 00:54:32,630
Um...

1553
00:54:32,630 --> 00:54:33,610
Um...

1554
00:54:33,610 --> 00:54:37,170
I was looking at the rewards on Overwatch.

1555
00:54:37,490 --> 00:54:41,350
And I was so fucking surprised how much it...

1556
00:54:41,350 --> 00:54:44,150
Like how much it felt...

1557
00:54:44,150 --> 00:54:46,250
Like the reward system for top up...

1558
00:54:46,250 --> 00:54:48,250
Did you know they tried to make it like...

1559
00:54:48,250 --> 00:54:49,950
Okay I was looking at the icons...

1560
00:54:49,950 --> 00:54:51,330
By my silence yes.

1561
00:54:51,450 --> 00:54:54,910
I was looking at the icons and I was so surprised.

1562
00:54:55,310 --> 00:54:57,250
Okay before I mention more.

1563
00:54:57,430 --> 00:55:01,270
Before you guys were like wow Doki what a sellout.

1564
00:55:01,510 --> 00:55:02,610
I want you to say...

1565
00:55:02,610 --> 00:55:03,450
I want to say...

1566
00:55:03,450 --> 00:55:09,430
Everything I've said is not as worse as everything actual Overwatch content creators...

1567
00:55:09,430 --> 00:55:11,850
And actual Overwatch pros have said about the game.

1568
00:55:12,010 --> 00:55:15,070
And they have been sponsored and have been paid to promote the game.

1569
00:55:15,330 --> 00:55:16,450
Much more than me.

1570
00:55:25,190 --> 00:55:25,710
They...

1571
00:55:27,710 --> 00:55:29,710
They play the game professionally...

1572
00:55:29,710 --> 00:55:32,350
And some of them are like Overwatch content creators...

1573
00:55:32,610 --> 00:55:36,410
And I swear to god they have said worse things than what I've said.

1574
00:55:36,890 --> 00:55:37,690
Anyway...

1575
00:55:38,950 --> 00:55:39,750
Anyway...

1576
00:55:40,550 --> 00:55:40,950
Um...

1577
00:55:42,170 --> 00:55:42,970
Anyway...

1578
00:55:42,970 --> 00:55:44,430
As I was saying...

1579
00:55:44,430 --> 00:55:45,310
As I was saying...

1580
00:55:45,310 --> 00:55:47,750
The fucking Overwatch icons...

1581
00:55:47,750 --> 00:55:48,970
I was so...

1582
00:55:48,970 --> 00:55:51,450
I was so fucking surprised.

1583
00:55:52,470 --> 00:55:54,490
I was so...

1584
00:55:54,490 --> 00:55:57,250
I was so surprised because back then...

1585
00:55:57,250 --> 00:55:59,930
Back then in Overwatch like...

1586
00:55:59,930 --> 00:56:02,590
The early top 500 prizes...

1587
00:56:02,590 --> 00:56:03,870
Were really good.

1588
00:56:03,990 --> 00:56:05,730
Like the animated sprays...

1589
00:56:05,730 --> 00:56:06,690
And the...

1590
00:56:06,690 --> 00:56:09,470
And the fucking icons were really really fucking pretty.

1591
00:56:09,770 --> 00:56:10,410
Now...

1592
00:56:10,410 --> 00:56:12,550
Back in Overwatch 1...

1593
00:56:12,550 --> 00:56:13,450
It was like...

1594
00:56:13,450 --> 00:56:13,790
Now...

1595
00:56:13,790 --> 00:56:16,310
The final seasons in Overwatch 1...

1596
00:56:16,310 --> 00:56:17,370
It was like...

1597
00:56:17,370 --> 00:56:18,230
Weapons.

1598
00:56:18,530 --> 00:56:19,630
So like...

1599
00:56:19,630 --> 00:56:20,730
If you don't get...

1600
00:56:20,730 --> 00:56:22,490
If you don't get top 500...

1601
00:56:22,490 --> 00:56:24,350
You get like a normal weapon icon.

1602
00:56:24,610 --> 00:56:26,170
Like Tracer's weapon.

1603
00:56:26,430 --> 00:56:27,430
It's just Tracer's weapon.

1604
00:56:27,730 --> 00:56:28,410
But...

1605
00:56:28,410 --> 00:56:30,210
If you get top 500...

1606
00:56:30,210 --> 00:56:31,150
It's gold.

1607
00:56:31,150 --> 00:56:32,470
A weapon's gold.

1608
00:56:32,710 --> 00:56:34,030
But it looks so shit.

1609
00:56:34,930 --> 00:56:35,890
It looks...

1610
00:56:36,510 --> 00:56:36,990
Terrible.

1611
00:56:37,990 --> 00:56:39,330
It's just the same thing.

1612
00:56:39,490 --> 00:56:40,550
It's just a color change.

1613
00:56:41,090 --> 00:56:41,710
In the...

1614
00:56:41,710 --> 00:56:43,470
In the early top 500 days...

1615
00:56:43,470 --> 00:56:45,090
It's like a different scenery...

1616
00:56:45,090 --> 00:56:45,810
Of the icon.

1617
00:56:46,110 --> 00:56:46,750
And it actually...

1618
00:56:46,750 --> 00:56:48,030
And it has the top 500 icon.

1619
00:56:48,250 --> 00:56:49,530
And the top 500 icon...

1620
00:56:49,530 --> 00:56:51,010
Is like right in the middle.

1621
00:56:51,890 --> 00:56:52,530
Fucking huge.

1622
00:56:52,690 --> 00:56:54,030
It was right in the middle.

1623
00:56:54,390 --> 00:56:55,670
And then you can...

1624
00:56:55,670 --> 00:56:57,170
Also the jade weapons too.

1625
00:56:57,290 --> 00:56:57,850
Oh my god.

1626
00:56:57,910 --> 00:56:59,410
Why would I have a jade weapon...

1627
00:56:59,410 --> 00:57:00,550
When I could have a gold weapon?

1628
00:57:00,550 --> 00:57:03,010
Why do I want my item to be fucking green?

1629
00:57:03,590 --> 00:57:05,410
I'm sorry if your favorite color is green.

1630
00:57:05,570 --> 00:57:07,050
I'm so sorry.

1631
00:57:12,310 --> 00:57:12,870
What...

1632
00:57:12,870 --> 00:57:14,010
What do I want?

1633
00:57:14,210 --> 00:57:15,310
A green weapon?

1634
00:57:15,570 --> 00:57:17,550
Or a fucking shiny gold?

1635
00:57:23,170 --> 00:57:23,730
But...

1636
00:57:23,730 --> 00:57:25,810
But as a member...

1637
00:57:25,810 --> 00:57:26,790
As a member...

1638
00:57:26,790 --> 00:57:27,730
It's like...

1639
00:57:27,730 --> 00:57:28,170
Amazing.

1640
00:57:28,450 --> 00:57:29,570
Green is great though.

1641
00:57:29,570 --> 00:57:31,190
Speaking of members...

1642
00:57:31,190 --> 00:57:32,530

1643
00:57:32,710 --> 00:57:33,650
Please don't unmember...

1644
00:57:36,050 --> 00:57:36,750

1646
00:57:37,470 --> 00:57:38,170

1647
00:57:38,170 --> 00:57:39,230
Please don't unmember.

1648
00:57:39,850 --> 00:57:44,090
Green is amazing in members though.

1649
00:57:44,330 --> 00:57:45,030
Like...

1650
00:57:45,030 --> 00:57:46,290
But as a weapon.

1651
00:57:46,530 --> 00:57:48,010
As a fucking weapon.

1652
00:57:52,620 --> 00:57:54,360
Speaking of members...

1653
00:57:54,360 --> 00:57:54,760
Don't worry.

1654
00:57:54,980 --> 00:57:56,100
I have a backup.

1655
00:57:56,360 --> 00:57:58,260
Guys, I didn't lose you guys.

1656
00:57:58,420 --> 00:57:59,120
Because...

1657
00:57:59,120 --> 00:58:00,780

1664
00:58:06,680 --> 00:58:08,020
New member badges.

1665
00:58:13,230 --> 00:58:13,990
Guys!

1666
00:58:14,210 --> 00:58:14,610
No.

1667
00:58:14,870 --> 00:58:16,330
No, you can't unmember.

1668
00:58:16,470 --> 00:58:18,670
Cause we're gonna have new member badges.

1669
00:58:19,690 --> 00:58:20,190
Woo!

1670
00:58:22,010 --> 00:58:22,770
Yes!

1671
00:58:22,910 --> 00:58:24,590
Green is a great color.

1672
00:58:24,970 --> 00:58:25,650
Woo!

1673
00:58:29,670 --> 00:58:32,430

Green is a very... is not... yeah exactly.

1699
00:59:23,330 --> 00:59:24,950
Green is not a very creative color.

1700
00:59:26,090 --> 00:59:27,630
Saimi, thank you for the super chat.

1701
00:59:27,790 --> 00:59:28,570

1706
00:59:37,370 --> 00:59:39,630
Also like to be fair, I told...

1707
00:59:41,110 --> 00:59:44,930
I changed the tomato to be like this.

1708
00:59:46,470 --> 00:59:46,990
Yeah.

1709
00:59:50,870 --> 00:59:55,090
This is like the edit I... I wanted to make.

1710
00:59:56,250 --> 00:59:59,270
So yeah, this is gonna be the new tomato icon.

1711
00:59:59,710 --> 01:00:03,190
Because I wanted all the... I wanted all the sub badges to be like universal.

1712
01:00:04,030 --> 01:00:06,850
Thank you to the artist that made the first tomato badge.

1713
01:00:06,990 --> 01:00:08,910
I really, really appreciate it for the placeholder.

1714
01:00:11,890 --> 01:00:13,590
So like really thank you.

1715
01:00:13,930 --> 01:00:16,110
But I'm gonna be changing the tomato.

1716
01:00:16,430 --> 01:00:18,050
Because like the tomato badge.

1717
01:00:18,190 --> 01:00:21,610
Because I want like all the badges to be universal and stuff.

1718
01:00:21,790 --> 01:00:23,170
So it's gonna look like this after.

1719
01:00:24,010 --> 01:00:27,750
It's gonna look like this later when it's done.

1720
01:00:29,790 --> 01:00:33,170
But yeah, actually like I'm really thankful.

1721
01:00:33,170 --> 01:00:37,330
The artist is like for the badges is one of my really good friends.

1722
01:00:37,550 --> 01:00:39,010
We've been friends for like...

1723
01:00:39,630 --> 01:00:40,670
Oh my god!

1724
01:00:40,710 --> 01:00:42,870
For like 15 plus years, I think.

1725
01:00:44,010 --> 01:00:47,770
And we've been friends for like 15 plus years.

1726
01:00:47,890 --> 01:00:48,570
Maybe longer.

1727
01:00:49,130 --> 01:00:49,990
Maybe longer.

1728
01:00:50,170 --> 01:00:51,110
But we've been artist friends.

1729
01:00:51,210 --> 01:00:52,070
We met on DeviantArt.

1730
01:00:55,950 --> 01:00:57,830
The cursed site now.

1731
01:00:58,170 --> 01:00:59,090
It has...

1732
01:00:59,090 --> 01:01:01,230
That site has gone downhill.

1733
01:01:01,230 --> 01:01:02,750
I'm surprised it's still around.

1734
01:01:03,130 --> 01:01:03,530
I'm sorry.

1735
01:01:03,670 --> 01:01:05,830
But I'm surprised DeviantArt is still fucking around.

1736
01:01:06,310 --> 01:01:07,910
But like we met on DeviantArt.

1737
01:01:08,070 --> 01:01:08,530
And...

1738
01:01:10,250 --> 01:01:11,770
We've been artist friends for a while.

1739
01:01:12,170 --> 01:01:13,750
When I was in...

1740
01:01:13,750 --> 01:01:15,790
When I was like you know...

1741
01:01:15,790 --> 01:01:18,270
When I started seriously YouTubing.

1742
01:01:18,310 --> 01:01:19,490
Like you know the last two years.

1743
01:01:19,710 --> 01:01:21,090
We actually lost...

1744
01:01:21,990 --> 01:01:22,470
Lost...

1745
01:01:23,110 --> 01:01:24,070
Not lost contact.

1746
01:01:24,190 --> 01:01:24,850
But we've...

1747
01:01:25,890 --> 01:01:28,370
We never had a chance to talk to each other.

1748
01:01:28,550 --> 01:01:29,530
During those two years.

1749
01:01:30,310 --> 01:01:31,590
Because I was so busy.

1750
01:01:32,370 --> 01:01:32,810
And...

1751
01:01:32,810 --> 01:01:34,450
I was really really busy.

1752
01:01:34,730 --> 01:01:35,430
And then...

1753
01:01:36,130 --> 01:01:38,030
They were really really busy as well.

1754
01:01:38,330 --> 01:01:39,150
And then...

1755
01:01:39,150 --> 01:01:41,690
Recently we started talking again after.

1756
01:01:41,750 --> 01:01:42,490
And they were like...

1757
01:01:42,490 --> 01:01:44,670
Yeah like I didn't really want to bother you.

1758
01:01:44,910 --> 01:01:46,690
Like you were so busy with work.

1759
01:01:46,890 --> 01:01:48,270
And like I was in there.

1760
01:01:48,330 --> 01:01:50,730
Like I was very busy with life as well.

1761
01:01:50,910 --> 01:01:52,290
So like I didn't really want to bother you.

1762
01:01:52,290 --> 01:01:53,390
I just wanted to watch you grow.

1763
01:01:53,770 --> 01:01:56,210
And then like they reached out to me after everything.

1764
01:01:56,370 --> 01:01:57,250
And was like...

1765
01:01:57,250 --> 01:01:59,510
Like sorry like never really talked to you.

1766
01:01:59,510 --> 01:02:00,410
After those two years.

1767
01:02:01,930 --> 01:02:02,370
And...

1768
01:02:04,210 --> 01:02:05,090
And like...

1769
01:02:05,550 --> 01:02:07,030
And then I was like...

1770
01:02:07,030 --> 01:02:09,170
Oh hey you want to still like work for me.

1771
01:02:09,290 --> 01:02:11,070
And you still want to like draw some stuff for me.

1772
01:02:11,290 --> 01:02:12,450
And then they're like yeah of course.

1773
01:02:12,630 --> 01:02:13,770
Because like we've always like...

1774
01:02:13,770 --> 01:02:15,370
They've always like done art for me.

1775
01:02:16,150 --> 01:02:19,150
And like we started like our...

1776
01:02:19,150 --> 01:02:20,510
They're basically the artists.

1777
01:02:20,790 --> 01:02:22,690
That I opened an Etsy with.

1778
01:02:22,910 --> 01:02:23,830
That's my friend.

1779
01:02:24,310 --> 01:02:25,150
That's my friend.

1780
01:02:26,190 --> 01:02:28,730
We've been friends for 15 plus years.

1781
01:02:29,050 --> 01:02:29,490
And like...

1782
01:02:29,490 --> 01:02:33,150
And like I've always helped them with like money issues and stuff in the past.

1783
01:02:33,430 --> 01:02:38,010
So like I helped them grow their art more and help them find clients.

1784
01:02:38,110 --> 01:02:39,910
Like I was sort of like their agent.

1785
01:02:43,860 --> 01:02:50,980
I was sort of like their agent slash like manager in a way that like I helped.

1786
01:02:51,060 --> 01:02:53,240
Because they're very artistic in what they do.

1787
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:54,280
They're like an untalented.

1788
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:56,780
They're like an incredibly talented artist.

1789
01:02:56,780 --> 01:03:02,300
And I was the one that persuaded them to do like Twitch emotes and do like art stuff.

1790
01:03:02,460 --> 01:03:05,120
And like open like art stores and stuff like that.

1791
01:03:05,340 --> 01:03:10,680
And like to promote their art and help them get like clients and stuff for their Twitch emotes and everything.

1792
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:14,860
And like I was like, you should do emotes with me.

1793
01:03:14,900 --> 01:03:17,440
Your art is so good for emotes and everything.

1794
01:03:20,660 --> 01:03:25,020
And then like, you know, and then I was like, do you still want to like we're talking.

1795
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:26,200
And then they're like, yeah.

1796
01:03:27,040 --> 01:03:32,900
They're still trying to find like they're still trying to like figure out like their career and stuff.

1797
01:03:33,080 --> 01:03:36,860
Because they're trying to find like a stable job regarding art and stuff.

1798
01:03:37,040 --> 01:03:39,980
And I asked them, I was like, you want to, you know, do you want to do art for me?

1799
01:03:40,080 --> 01:03:44,960
You know, like I can, I'm looking for an artist for my sub badges.

1800
01:03:45,300 --> 01:03:46,420

1805
01:03:55,400 --> 01:03:58,920
And yeah, so I'm really happy that they're doing my sub badges.

1806
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:04,140
I even gave them like a really big tip because I was like, bro, I make like way too much money now.

1807
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:06,580
Like, just take it.

1808
01:04:06,640 --> 01:04:12,440

Catch up with them later too.

1815
01:04:30,670 --> 01:04:33,710
I actually had a lot of like old friends that reached out to me.

1816
01:04:34,050 --> 01:04:36,870
I haven't replied back to their text yet.

1817
01:04:37,790 --> 01:04:43,110
But like this is an old friend that like I basically got in one season in Overwatch.

1818
01:04:43,270 --> 01:04:45,030
I got like top 500 with her.

1819
01:04:45,070 --> 01:04:45,850
We would do a support.

1820
01:04:46,310 --> 01:04:50,110
We would do a support together in Overwatch 1.

1821
01:04:52,330 --> 01:04:54,350
And we got top 500 together.

1822
01:04:55,650 --> 01:04:57,470
And like, like she reached out to me.

1823
01:04:57,470 --> 01:05:01,450
And was like, hey, like we saw everything that's happening.

1824
01:05:01,750 --> 01:05:05,410
Like, like, like I'm sorry we lost contact and stuff.

1825
01:05:05,530 --> 01:05:06,230
Like lost...

1826
01:05:07,210 --> 01:05:13,930
I'm sorry like we didn't like talk to each other after Overwatch and stuff.

1827
01:05:14,110 --> 01:05:18,550
Like you want to just like, you know, hang out and just catch up and everything.

1828
01:05:18,850 --> 01:05:20,570
I was like, I haven't responded back.

1829
01:05:20,610 --> 01:05:21,850
But I thought like it was...

1830
01:05:21,850 --> 01:05:23,910
I went to like BlizzCon with her too.

1831
01:05:25,850 --> 01:05:27,450
That was how long ago.

1832
01:05:27,450 --> 01:05:28,190
It was.

1833
01:05:28,210 --> 01:05:29,570
It was so long ago.

1834
01:05:29,770 --> 01:05:32,130
Like she was like actually one of my best friends in Overwatch.

1835
01:05:32,550 --> 01:05:33,950
But we lost like...

1836
01:05:33,950 --> 01:05:34,750
We lost...

1837
01:05:34,750 --> 01:05:35,330
What's that word?

1838
01:05:35,770 --> 01:05:36,470
Lost touch?

1839
01:05:36,770 --> 01:05:37,390
Is that it?

1840
01:05:37,610 --> 01:05:40,590
We lost touch after Overwatch sort of died.

1841
01:05:40,810 --> 01:05:41,830
Not died, sort of died.

1842
01:05:41,930 --> 01:05:43,390
But like after like we both...

1843
01:05:43,390 --> 01:05:45,770
Like she had to go like to...

1844
01:05:45,770 --> 01:05:49,170
She had to like focus on studies and stuff.

1845
01:05:49,330 --> 01:05:51,530
And then I moved on to Apex.

1846
01:05:51,690 --> 01:05:52,630
They got lost contact.

1847
01:05:52,790 --> 01:05:54,110
Yeah, we lost contact.

1848
01:05:54,150 --> 01:05:57,430
But she's like actually one of my best friends in Overwatch 1.

1849
01:05:57,430 --> 01:06:01,210
And like it was really nice that she reached out to me and stuff too.

1850
01:06:01,410 --> 01:06:03,430
So yeah, I should text her back soon.

1851
01:06:03,470 --> 01:06:05,390
I should text her back soon.

1852
01:06:07,260 --> 01:06:09,480
It was just really nice, you know.

1853
01:06:09,480 --> 01:06:13,940
It was really nice that a lot of my older friends reached out to me to talk.

1854
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,700
And just like wanted to hang out and stuff.

1855
01:06:16,800 --> 01:06:17,680
So it was really nice.

1856
01:06:18,020 --> 01:06:19,980
Yeah, I'm hanging out with my other like...

1857
01:06:19,980 --> 01:06:20,860
My other...

1858
01:06:20,860 --> 01:06:22,240
My artist friend.

1859
01:06:22,340 --> 01:06:24,620
The one that has friends who lived for 15 plus years.

1860
01:06:24,700 --> 01:06:25,600
Like tomorrow.

1861
01:06:25,960 --> 01:06:27,420
Just to catch up and everything.

1862
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:29,560
Um...

1863
01:06:29,560 --> 01:06:31,200
Well, thank you for the super chat.

1864
01:06:31,240 --> 01:06:32,040
Thank you, thank you.

1865
01:06:32,980 --> 01:06:35,220
Contract Doki friend to do monthly backgrounds for you.

1866
01:06:35,220 --> 01:06:37,660
Give her more income as a plus.

1867
01:06:37,860 --> 01:06:38,840
Thank you for the super chat.

1868
01:06:38,900 --> 01:06:39,760
Thank you, thank you.

1869
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:40,680
This is so wholesome.

1870
01:06:40,780 --> 01:06:41,120
Love it.

1871
01:06:41,140 --> 01:06:42,320
And so thank you for the super chat.

1872
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:43,320
Thank you, thank you.

1873
01:06:44,560 --> 01:06:45,620
Thank you for the super chat.

1874
01:06:45,680 --> 01:06:46,360
Thank you, thank you.

1875
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:47,160
Oh my god.

1876
01:06:47,220 --> 01:06:49,380
I had like old Apex friends too.

1877
01:06:49,940 --> 01:06:50,300
Like...

1878
01:06:50,940 --> 01:06:51,300
Um...

1879
01:06:51,300 --> 01:06:52,340
This one...

1880
01:06:52,340 --> 01:06:53,360
Another Apex friend.

1881
01:06:53,460 --> 01:06:53,900
Oh my god.

1882
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:55,920
This Apex friend that reached out to me.

1883
01:06:56,060 --> 01:06:56,620
They like...

1884
01:06:56,620 --> 01:06:57,320
They're in like...

1885
01:06:57,420 --> 01:06:58,940
I don't know if they're a doctor now.

1886
01:06:59,220 --> 01:07:00,280
But they were in...

1887
01:07:00,280 --> 01:07:01,140
A dentist?

1888
01:07:01,640 --> 01:07:02,500
They were a dentist.

1889
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:04,060
They were a doctor.

1890
01:07:04,580 --> 01:07:05,740
They were in med school.

1891
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:11,540
I'm trying to remember.

1892
01:07:11,980 --> 01:07:12,460
Fuck!

1893
01:07:12,780 --> 01:07:14,040
They were in med school!

1894
01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:16,620
But don't remember it was dentistry or...

1895
01:07:16,620 --> 01:07:17,540
Or...

1896
01:07:17,540 --> 01:07:18,880
Or a doctor.

1897
01:07:20,520 --> 01:07:21,080
But...

1898
01:07:21,620 --> 01:07:22,320
What are the...

1899
01:07:22,320 --> 01:07:23,240
It's the same thing.

1900
01:07:23,300 --> 01:07:24,560
They make a lot of money.

1901
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:25,540
They make...

1902
01:07:25,540 --> 01:07:27,820
They make not a lot of money.

1903
01:07:27,820 --> 01:07:29,400
But one of them contacted me.

1904
01:07:29,940 --> 01:07:30,500
And...

1905
01:07:30,500 --> 01:07:31,500
Um...

1906
01:07:31,500 --> 01:07:32,540
When...

1907
01:07:32,540 --> 01:07:33,260
Uh...

1908
01:07:33,260 --> 01:07:34,820
One of them contacted me too.

1909
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:35,620
To be like...

1910
01:07:35,620 --> 01:07:37,000
You wanna catch up and stuff.

1911
01:07:37,220 --> 01:07:37,780
And everything.

1912
01:07:38,220 --> 01:07:38,700
Um...

1913
01:07:38,700 --> 01:07:39,560
They actually...

1914
01:07:39,560 --> 01:07:40,520
They actually...

1915
01:07:40,520 --> 01:07:41,220
It was...

1916
01:07:41,220 --> 01:07:42,460
It's really wholesome.

1917
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:44,080
They were the ones that like...

1918
01:07:44,080 --> 01:07:45,040
Um...

1919
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:48,100
Supported me and stuff.

1920
01:07:48,180 --> 01:07:48,880
When I...

1921
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:49,560
You know...

1922
01:07:49,560 --> 01:07:52,240
When I first started seriously Vtubing and everything.

1923
01:07:52,980 --> 01:07:53,540
Uh...

1924
01:07:53,540 --> 01:07:54,740
When I like...

1925
01:07:54,740 --> 01:07:56,600
Had my big break basically.

1926
01:07:56,760 --> 01:07:57,800
And like applied to like...

1927
01:07:57,800 --> 01:07:58,200
Like VLogs.

1928
01:07:58,200 --> 01:07:58,860
And stuff like that.

1929
01:07:58,980 --> 01:08:00,260
Like they helped out and everything.

1930
01:08:00,600 --> 01:08:02,560
And was there like cheering me on.

1931
01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:03,600
So like it was...

1932
01:08:03,600 --> 01:08:04,160
Uh...

1933
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:04,620
We lost...

1934
01:08:04,620 --> 01:08:07,420
Lost contact when I first started seriously working.

1935
01:08:07,800 --> 01:08:08,860
Just cause like...

1936
01:08:08,860 --> 01:08:09,340
Um...

1937
01:08:09,340 --> 01:08:10,080
It was very hard.

1938
01:08:10,260 --> 01:08:11,220
I think like...

1939
01:08:11,220 --> 01:08:11,860
When you...

1940
01:08:11,860 --> 01:08:12,820
When you get...

1941
01:08:12,820 --> 01:08:13,640
Become corporate.

1942
01:08:14,140 --> 01:08:16,140
It's very hard to keep in touch with people.

1943
01:08:16,480 --> 01:08:17,000
Um...

1944
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:18,180
Because you're always so busy.

1945
01:08:18,520 --> 01:08:22,080
And I really appreciate all my old friends like...

1946
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:22,700
Uh...

1947
01:08:22,700 --> 01:08:22,820
Uh...

1948
01:08:22,820 --> 01:08:23,940
Reaching out to me and everything.

1949
01:08:24,140 --> 01:08:27,780
And like being very understanding that I was just so fucking busy.

1950
01:08:27,780 --> 01:08:33,520
I'm so fucking busy that I didn't have a chance to talk much to a lot of my old friends and everything.

1951
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:39,300
And so it's really nice that a lot of them reached out and stuff like that.

1952
01:08:39,420 --> 01:08:47,620
And was super understanding with just me being antisocial.

1953
01:08:49,640 --> 01:08:54,040
Me being very antisocial and stuff.

1954
01:08:54,040 --> 01:09:00,540
So I really appreciate it too.

1955
01:09:01,760 --> 01:09:02,640
And yeah...

1956
01:09:06,020 --> 01:09:07,460
Kumi, thank you for the super chat.

1957
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:07,760
Thank you.

1958
01:09:08,220 --> 01:09:11,940
As a doctor, I can assure you, Doki, no we don't make a lot of money.

1959
01:09:12,260 --> 01:09:12,700
Really?

1960
01:09:13,280 --> 01:09:14,820
It was all a lie?

1961
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:17,000
Like...

1962
01:09:20,860 --> 01:09:22,520
Asian parents lie to me?

1963
01:09:25,840 --> 01:09:28,980
Why the fuck do they always want you to be a doctor?

1964
01:09:33,900 --> 01:09:36,560
It's always doctor or lawyer.

1965
01:09:37,620 --> 01:09:38,820
No way!

1966
01:09:41,840 --> 01:09:44,840
I always thought doctor or lawyer.

1967
01:09:45,400 --> 01:09:47,740
But you don't make a lot of money?

1968
01:09:48,420 --> 01:09:49,580
Oh my god.

1969
01:09:49,620 --> 01:09:51,780
I feel like the world is just a lie.

1970
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:53,600
It's just...

1971
01:09:54,040 --> 01:09:55,740
To be fair, like...

1972
01:09:55,740 --> 01:10:00,100
It must suck to be a doctor in America because of student loans.

1973
01:10:00,580 --> 01:10:02,340
I would just say that like...

1974
01:10:02,620 --> 01:10:12,160
It must take you fucking years to make back the amount of money that it takes to pay off your student loans for lawyer and doctor.

1975
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:13,880
Because there's a lot of schooling.

1976
01:10:16,660 --> 01:10:19,780
There's a lot of school involved to that.

1977
01:10:20,080 --> 01:10:20,560
Yeah.

1978
01:10:22,680 --> 01:10:27,500
I can't believe people would spread misinformation about it.

1979
01:10:27,660 --> 01:10:30,460
If you're a millennial right now...

1980
01:10:30,460 --> 01:10:33,360
Tell your children the truth.

1981
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:34,200
Isn't that crazy?

1982
01:10:34,420 --> 01:10:35,840
Millennials now are having kids.

1983
01:10:38,280 --> 01:10:39,600
I'm sorry, millennials.

1984
01:10:39,860 --> 01:10:42,000
If you don't have a kid...

1985
01:10:48,620 --> 01:10:50,980
Millennials are at an age that they should have kids.

1986
01:10:51,560 --> 01:10:53,560
They should have doesn't mean they should.

1987
01:10:54,360 --> 01:10:56,540
They should have doesn't mean you have to.

1988
01:10:56,620 --> 01:10:58,600
Sorry, English is my first language.

1989
01:11:04,400 --> 01:11:05,360
But anyway...

1990
01:11:05,980 --> 01:11:09,160
Anyway, Millennials, don't tell your kids...

1991
01:11:09,160 --> 01:11:13,000
that being a lawyer or a doctor is a way...

1992
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:14,360
Actually, you don't have to!

1993
01:11:14,920 --> 01:11:15,680
Because...

1994
01:11:15,680 --> 01:11:17,160
Because...

1995
01:11:17,160 --> 01:11:19,660
Being a millennial fucking sucks now!

1996
01:11:20,080 --> 01:11:21,200
Because like...

1997
01:11:21,200 --> 01:11:23,420
We can't afford houses.

1998
01:11:23,940 --> 01:11:25,380
And like...

1999
01:11:28,340 --> 01:11:30,760
Being a millennial fucking sucks because...

2000
01:11:30,760 --> 01:11:31,460
You know...

2001
01:11:31,460 --> 01:11:33,420
Housing market sucks.

2002
01:11:36,360 --> 01:11:38,800
We can barely afford anything.

2003
01:11:45,720 --> 01:11:47,720
So why can't you afford children?

2004
01:11:49,360 --> 01:11:53,020
Why the fuck will we be able to afford...

2005
01:11:53,020 --> 01:11:54,660
Children's universities?

2006
01:11:56,880 --> 01:11:58,360
Chat, university is very expensive.

2007
01:11:59,100 --> 01:11:59,580
Like...

2008
01:12:00,160 --> 01:12:03,500
Like, millennials can barely afford their own university tuition.

2009
01:12:03,860 --> 01:12:05,260
Actually, they can!

2010
01:12:05,560 --> 01:12:06,240
They can!

2011
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:08,080
That's why student loans exist!

2012
01:12:09,160 --> 01:12:10,620
That's why student loans fucking exist!

2013
01:12:11,100 --> 01:12:13,000
They can't afford fucking...

2014
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:13,980
Student tuition!

2015
01:12:14,420 --> 01:12:17,500
So why the fuck would they afford their kids' student tuition?

2016
01:12:17,860 --> 01:12:19,960
Don't tell them to be doctors or lawyers.

2017
01:12:20,240 --> 01:12:22,260
Tell them to go into computer sci-

2018
01:12:26,680 --> 01:12:29,880
Tell them to get into computer science!

2019
01:12:30,180 --> 01:12:33,020
Or en- Wait, actually, does engineers make a lot of money?

2020
01:12:33,100 --> 01:12:36,460
No, if doctors and lawyers can't make a lot of money...

2021
01:12:36,460 --> 01:12:37,740
So do engineers.

2022
01:12:37,740 --> 01:12:38,640
Comm Sci!

2023
01:12:38,900 --> 01:12:39,900
That's the way to go!

2024
01:12:40,240 --> 01:12:40,780
Com Sci!

2025
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:43,180
Silicon Valley!

2026
01:12:44,020 --> 01:12:44,980
There we go.

2027
01:12:45,140 --> 01:12:46,000
We figured it out!

2028
01:12:46,540 --> 01:12:48,980
Com Sci is a new lawyer doctor.

2029
01:12:49,380 --> 01:12:50,580
Computer Science?

2030
01:12:51,520 --> 01:12:52,660
New lawyer doctor?

2031
01:12:53,880 --> 01:12:54,560
and...

2032
01:12:55,260 --> 01:12:56,400
Silicon Valley.

2033
01:12:57,460 --> 01:12:58,360
That's the goal!

2034
01:12:59,100 --> 01:13:00,600
That's so REAL!

2035
01:13:01,100 --> 01:13:03,240
I just got somebody like Software Science.

2036
01:13:03,240 --> 01:13:04,340
Computer Science here, it sucks.

2037
01:13:04,680 --> 01:13:05,140
Yes!

2038
01:13:05,420 --> 01:13:09,020
But u can pay- You don't have to get a master's degree.

2039
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:11,980
And then get a doctorate.

2040
01:13:11,980 --> 01:13:13,460
You don't have to go to more school.

2041
01:13:15,040 --> 01:13:17,020
Computer science is flooded at the moment.

2042
01:13:17,120 --> 01:13:18,320
The thing is...

2043
01:13:18,320 --> 01:13:19,280
Okay, you're right.

2044
01:13:19,740 --> 01:13:20,540
Technical school.

2045
01:13:21,320 --> 01:13:22,060
There we go.

2046
01:13:22,160 --> 01:13:23,220
I figured it out, chat.

2047
01:13:23,820 --> 01:13:27,280
Tell your children to be plumbers.

2048
01:13:27,680 --> 01:13:28,780
And like...

2049
01:13:29,540 --> 01:13:33,060
To be plumbers and like anything else in technical school.

2050
01:13:33,660 --> 01:13:34,560
Trade school.

2051
01:13:34,740 --> 01:13:35,460
And trade school.

2052
01:13:36,520 --> 01:13:37,000
Because...

2053
01:13:37,640 --> 01:13:38,120
Oh.

2054
01:13:38,300 --> 01:13:40,340
I know I'm gonna reference a South Park episode.

2055
01:13:40,700 --> 01:13:41,460
Because nowadays...

2056
01:13:42,120 --> 01:13:43,660
We can't do shit anymore.

2057
01:13:43,940 --> 01:13:44,860
Like we can't...

2058
01:13:46,480 --> 01:13:48,280
We can't do shit anymore.

2059
01:13:48,360 --> 01:13:51,060
We always need to call somebody to do stuff for us.

2060
01:13:51,320 --> 01:13:54,320
So now trade school is like much more demanding.

2061
01:13:54,820 --> 01:13:58,840
Because like trade school like jobs are now in demand.

2062
01:13:59,300 --> 01:14:01,080
Because no one wants to do things their own.

2063
01:14:01,160 --> 01:14:03,120
No one knows how to do shit on their own anymore.

2064
01:14:03,340 --> 01:14:05,180
Which is true because I'm that person.

2065
01:14:05,460 --> 01:14:07,440
I need to call somebody to do stuff.

2066
01:14:07,580 --> 01:14:09,300
Like I don't know how to fucking fix...

2067
01:14:09,300 --> 01:14:10,500
If you like watch a tutorial.

2068
01:14:10,760 --> 01:14:12,000
I still don't fucking know.

2069
01:14:12,320 --> 01:14:13,620
Like I'd rather call someone.

2070
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:15,180
So trade school time.

2071
01:14:16,060 --> 01:14:18,200
Tell your children to go into trade school.

2072
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:20,720
And the best part is...

2073
01:14:20,720 --> 01:14:25,220
When your child knows how to fix the toilet or do like plumbing.

2074
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:26,880
And be a handyman.

2075
01:14:27,200 --> 01:14:29,060
You don't have to call anybody.

2076
01:14:29,720 --> 01:14:31,160
You can just be like...

2077
01:14:31,160 --> 01:14:32,200
I'm your mom.

2078
01:14:32,200 --> 01:14:34,700
I gave birth to you.

2079
01:14:35,040 --> 01:14:36,280
Fix my toilet.

2080
01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:38,440
And then like you know...

2081
01:14:38,440 --> 01:14:40,580
With a little bit of therapy for the child after that.

2082
01:14:40,880 --> 01:14:42,840
Like you just balance it off with therapy.

2083
01:14:43,300 --> 01:14:43,740
Because...

2084
01:14:50,840 --> 01:14:52,380
Don't talk to your child like that.

2085
01:14:52,440 --> 01:14:53,840
Because maybe you have to pay for your therapy.

2086
01:14:54,220 --> 01:14:55,160
But like...

2087
01:14:55,160 --> 01:14:56,900
So just say it be like...

2088
01:14:56,900 --> 01:14:58,700
Oh sweetie hey...

2089
01:14:59,800 --> 01:15:01,760
Mom's got a leaking faucet.

2090
01:15:01,800 --> 01:15:02,820
Do you wanna...

2091
01:15:02,820 --> 01:15:04,140
Do you wanna like...

2092
01:15:04,140 --> 01:15:04,640
You know...

2093
01:15:04,640 --> 01:15:05,480
Oh man...

2094
01:15:05,480 --> 01:15:06,220
I mean...

2095
01:15:06,220 --> 01:15:08,560
I try to call the handyman and everything.

2096
01:15:08,820 --> 01:15:10,300
But like they're so...

2097
01:15:10,820 --> 01:15:12,280
Backed up right now.

2098
01:15:12,340 --> 01:15:13,880
And it's like so expensive.

2099
01:15:15,360 --> 01:15:15,840
Son...

2100
01:15:15,840 --> 01:15:17,600
It's so expensive.

2101
01:15:19,280 --> 01:15:21,160
I just don't know what to do.

2102
01:15:21,640 --> 01:15:23,600
And then your son is gonna be like...

2103
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:24,420
Don't worry mom.

2104
01:15:24,660 --> 01:15:27,280
I can come over and fix your...

2105
01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:27,740
What did I say?

2106
01:15:27,780 --> 01:15:28,620
Toilet or plumbing issue.

2107
01:15:28,720 --> 01:15:28,980
I don't remember.

2108
01:15:29,160 --> 01:15:29,880
Whatever is fine.

2109
01:15:30,040 --> 01:15:31,660
I can fix your plumbing issue.

2110
01:15:31,660 --> 01:15:33,340
Don't spend money on that.

2111
01:15:33,540 --> 01:15:35,420
That's why I went to trade school.

2112
01:15:35,880 --> 01:15:36,660
And then...

2113
01:15:36,660 --> 01:15:37,360
BAM!

2114
01:15:37,500 --> 01:15:38,880
You saved money.

2115
01:15:45,520 --> 01:15:46,940
We did it!

2116
01:15:47,120 --> 01:15:48,920
We solved the issue!

2117
01:15:50,420 --> 01:15:52,300
I'm getting PTSD.

2118
01:15:55,940 --> 01:15:57,000
Look at that.

2119
01:15:57,220 --> 01:15:58,100
That's what you do.

2120
01:15:59,320 --> 01:16:00,960
I'm giving you life tips.

2121
01:16:01,660 --> 01:16:02,080
Guys.

2122
01:16:02,140 --> 01:16:03,240
Write this down.

2123
01:16:03,500 --> 01:16:05,940
I'm actually giving you life tips right now.

2124
01:16:06,640 --> 01:16:08,880
Tell your children to go to trade school.

2125
01:16:12,100 --> 01:16:13,700
Instead of doctor, lawyer.

2126
01:16:14,180 --> 01:16:15,400
It's not worth it.

2127
01:16:16,880 --> 01:16:18,580
Student loan signed.

2128
01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:22,180
Ria, thank you for the super chat.

2129
01:16:22,260 --> 01:16:22,600
Thank you.

2130
01:16:24,020 --> 01:16:25,340
Nia, thank you for the super chat.

2131
01:16:25,440 --> 01:16:25,680
Thank you.

2132
01:16:26,580 --> 01:16:29,160
ComSci is also struggling because companies over expanded.

2133
01:16:29,540 --> 01:16:30,160
And now everyone's...

2134
01:16:30,160 --> 01:16:30,560
Oh yeah.

2135
01:16:30,660 --> 01:16:32,100
I heard everyone's getting laid off now.

2136
01:16:32,140 --> 01:16:33,700
It's much harder for new grads to get jobs.

2137
01:16:33,920 --> 01:16:34,780
I think like...

2138
01:16:34,780 --> 01:16:35,980
That's just not ComSci.

2139
01:16:36,140 --> 01:16:36,740
It's everything.

2140
01:16:38,220 --> 01:16:40,360
That's definitely not just ComSci.

2141
01:16:40,660 --> 01:16:41,500
It's everything.

2142
01:16:42,920 --> 01:16:44,160
Everybody's downsizing now.

2143
01:16:44,500 --> 01:16:45,680
Not just ComSci.

2144
01:16:49,400 --> 01:16:50,760
Hey, thank you for the super chat.

2145
01:16:50,820 --> 01:16:51,480
Thank you.

2146
01:16:51,500 --> 01:16:52,220
Thank you, Doki.

2147
01:16:52,340 --> 01:16:55,160
To remind me to not pay student loans.

2148
01:16:55,280 --> 01:16:57,800
I basically get free schooling.

2149
01:16:58,680 --> 01:16:59,160
Okay.

2150
01:16:59,160 --> 01:16:59,300
Okay.

2151
01:16:59,740 --> 01:17:00,180
Legally.

2152
01:17:00,260 --> 01:17:02,900
Just pay for it when it's legal.

2153
01:17:03,100 --> 01:17:06,340
If it's legal and you have to pay for it, pay for it.

2154
01:17:06,440 --> 01:17:10,440
If like avoiding student loans is legal, please don't commit illegal acts.

2155
01:17:10,660 --> 01:17:11,720
Thank you for the super chat.

2156
01:17:11,820 --> 01:17:12,100
Thank you.

2157
01:17:12,160 --> 01:17:12,640
Thank you.

2158
01:17:12,760 --> 01:17:13,540
What was it?

2159
01:17:13,860 --> 01:17:14,740
Oh my gosh.

2160
01:17:14,780 --> 01:17:17,920
There was like a channel for illegal life hacks and stuff.

2161
01:17:18,060 --> 01:17:18,520
Oh my god.

2162
01:17:18,620 --> 01:17:20,120
I had a short rec...

2163
01:17:20,120 --> 01:17:22,860
I had like a short channel recommended to me.

2164
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:27,120
And then it was like illegal life hacks with like SpongeBob and Patrick.

2165
01:17:27,260 --> 01:17:27,920
I don't know why.

2166
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:35,940
It was like the channel was run by SpongeBob and Patrick AI voices.

2167
01:17:36,600 --> 01:17:38,560
Did you guys see that channel?

2168
01:17:38,960 --> 01:17:41,520
Or am I just a freak that got recommended?

2169
01:17:43,300 --> 01:17:44,520
I'm just a freak.

2170
01:17:44,580 --> 01:17:44,880
Let's see.

2171
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:48,860
Sponge illegal life hacks.

2172
01:17:51,320 --> 01:17:51,920
SpongeBob.

2173
01:17:53,660 --> 01:17:55,100
It had a lot of subscribers.

2174
01:17:55,100 --> 01:18:00,020
It has like almost half a million subscribers chat.

2175
01:18:00,220 --> 01:18:00,860
This is like...

2176
01:18:00,860 --> 01:18:01,100
Okay.

2177
01:18:01,200 --> 01:18:03,020
This is like the channel...

2178
01:18:03,020 --> 01:18:06,740
The shorts that I kept getting like recommended for.

2179
01:18:06,920 --> 01:18:08,080
Like this one.

2180
01:18:08,340 --> 01:18:09,360
This is like...

2181
01:18:10,340 --> 01:18:16,000
Basically, they give you like illegal life hacks at SpongeBob Patrick AI.

2182
01:18:16,160 --> 01:18:17,460
I don't know why.

2183
01:18:20,300 --> 01:18:21,800
Unethical life tips.

2184
01:18:21,980 --> 01:18:22,780
Yeah, unethical.

2185
01:18:22,840 --> 01:18:23,040
Yeah.

2186
01:18:23,040 --> 01:18:25,440
It was like unethical life tips.

2187
01:18:25,920 --> 01:18:26,740
Life hacks.

2188
01:18:27,020 --> 01:18:27,740
And okay.

2189
01:18:27,880 --> 01:18:37,140
Like I gave an unethical life hack where I was like if you're giving a summon for jury duty, just like convince them that you have a bias.

2190
01:18:37,260 --> 01:18:40,400
Because like for those who didn't hear this because I said this on Twitch.

2191
01:18:40,900 --> 01:18:45,620
Basically, like to be in jury duty, you have to have zero biases.

2192
01:18:47,620 --> 01:18:50,780
You have to have zero biases for any...

2193
01:18:50,780 --> 01:18:52,460
For like the trial.

2194
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:53,820
So you shouldn't have...

2195
01:18:53,820 --> 01:18:59,640
You should not swing over one or the other because if you have a bias, it will become a mistrial.

2196
01:18:59,860 --> 01:19:01,620
Because if you're like, oh, I knew it.

2197
01:19:01,620 --> 01:19:05,160
I knew that person was guilty the moment they walk in.

2198
01:19:05,560 --> 01:19:06,880
You will give up.

2199
01:19:06,920 --> 01:19:08,100
You will make it a mistrial.

2200
01:19:08,180 --> 01:19:09,120
Even if they are guilty.

2201
01:19:10,840 --> 01:19:12,900
Even if they are like guilty guilty.

2202
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:17,340
You cannot admit that you have a bias towards something.

2203
01:19:17,620 --> 01:19:18,680
So like...

2204
01:19:25,340 --> 01:19:31,780
So basically, like, you know, if you get summoned to, you know, you just be like, you know, I feel...

2205
01:19:34,580 --> 01:19:37,520
Just be like, well, I, you know, I...

2206
01:19:37,520 --> 01:19:38,640
I don't know.

2207
01:19:38,980 --> 01:19:40,800
I don't think that person is a bad guy.

2208
01:19:41,040 --> 01:19:41,820
Even though...

2209
01:19:46,220 --> 01:19:47,900
Just be like, I don't know.

2210
01:19:47,960 --> 01:19:48,520
Never met...

2211
01:19:48,520 --> 01:19:49,180
I don't know.

2212
01:19:49,240 --> 01:19:50,520
He seems pretty innocent.

2213
01:19:50,520 --> 01:19:51,080
You know?

2214
01:19:51,200 --> 01:19:52,300
He seems pretty...

2215
01:19:52,300 --> 01:19:53,660
Seems pretty innocent.

2216
01:19:58,360 --> 01:19:59,320
And then...

2217
01:20:00,080 --> 01:20:01,040
And then...

2218
01:20:01,040 --> 01:20:04,940
And then the judge would be like, yeah, we're not picking...

2219
01:20:04,940 --> 01:20:05,820
They're not...

2220
01:20:05,820 --> 01:20:07,660
We're not picking this person to be on the jury.

2221
01:20:07,960 --> 01:20:09,660
But that's only if you really...

2222
01:20:10,920 --> 01:20:11,620
Just so...

2223
01:20:11,620 --> 01:20:13,540
Just if you really don't want to be on jury duty.

2224
01:20:13,840 --> 01:20:17,220
Just if you don't really want to be on jury duty.

2225
01:20:18,440 --> 01:20:19,680
To be fair though.

2226
01:20:19,820 --> 01:20:20,480
You can't...

2227
01:20:20,520 --> 01:20:21,460
I feel like...

2228
01:20:21,460 --> 01:20:22,160
Okay.

2229
01:20:22,380 --> 01:20:22,660
Okay.

2230
01:20:22,720 --> 01:20:24,280
But to be like perfectly honest.

2231
01:20:24,800 --> 01:20:28,640
If you get somebody that doesn't want to be on jury duty on jury duty.

2232
01:20:28,760 --> 01:20:30,260
I feel like that hurts your case.

2233
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:32,160
More than like...

2234
01:20:32,160 --> 01:20:32,900
More than...

2235
01:20:32,900 --> 01:20:33,400
Yeah.

2236
01:20:34,460 --> 01:20:35,180
Oh, sorry.

2237
01:20:35,260 --> 01:20:35,800
The lawyers do.

2238
01:20:35,960 --> 01:20:38,800
But you have to convince the judge to take you.

2239
01:20:39,400 --> 01:20:44,060
But I just feel like if you hate jury duty and you get into jury duty.

2240
01:20:44,320 --> 01:20:45,700
I feel like...

2241
01:20:45,700 --> 01:20:48,660
Like, you know, it hurts the...

2242
01:20:48,660 --> 01:20:49,240
The...

2243
01:20:49,240 --> 01:20:51,060
The trial more than helps.

2244
01:20:51,160 --> 01:20:52,680
Because like they don't want to be there.

2245
01:20:52,820 --> 01:20:54,260
Like they don't...

2246
01:20:58,360 --> 01:21:01,160
Like they just don't want to be there.

2247
01:21:01,500 --> 01:21:05,560
You want people that actually are willing to, you know, like the justice system.

2248
01:21:05,800 --> 01:21:06,320
You know?

2249
01:21:06,440 --> 01:21:11,160
You want someone that actually likes the justice system and like has zero biases.

2250
01:21:11,580 --> 01:21:12,680
Because what if like...

2251
01:21:12,680 --> 01:21:15,680
Because the thing about jury duty is that...

2252
01:21:16,080 --> 01:21:17,180
By the way...

2253
01:21:17,180 --> 01:21:17,980
Like...

2254
01:21:17,980 --> 01:21:18,800
If...

2255
01:21:18,800 --> 01:21:20,340
Please correct me if I'm wrong.

2256
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:24,980
Because majority of what I know about jury duty is from TV shows.

2257
01:21:25,280 --> 01:21:25,760
And...

2258
01:21:29,400 --> 01:21:33,640
And just like reading a little bit about it.

2259
01:21:33,700 --> 01:21:34,900
Like just reading a little bit.

2260
01:21:34,960 --> 01:21:36,780
So please, if you're a lawyer, correct me.

2261
01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:37,460
And or a judge.

2262
01:21:37,640 --> 01:21:38,920
Correct me if I'm wrong.

2263
01:21:39,080 --> 01:21:40,120
But like...

2264
01:21:41,940 --> 01:21:47,380
I'm assuming like the part that's right was where like the jury has to be unified.

2265
01:21:48,020 --> 01:21:52,580
It has to be like unified in their decision.

2266
01:21:53,220 --> 01:21:55,640
So I feel like, you know...

2267
01:21:55,640 --> 01:21:58,340
If you don't want to be in jury duty.

2268
01:21:58,860 --> 01:22:00,200
And like...

2269
01:22:00,200 --> 01:22:02,440
And the decision has to be universal.

2270
01:22:03,220 --> 01:22:05,360
What if I just vote for the majority?

2271
01:22:05,860 --> 01:22:06,860
Are you nameless?

2272
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:07,120
Yeah.

2273
01:22:07,200 --> 01:22:10,120
What if I just vote for the majority because I want this to fucking end?

2274
01:22:11,060 --> 01:22:11,640
Like...

2275
01:22:11,640 --> 01:22:14,500
Because if you don't, you like prolong the trial.

2276
01:22:14,860 --> 01:22:17,300
You prolong the jury duty.

2277
01:22:17,300 --> 01:22:19,420
So what if I just want to leave?

2278
01:22:19,600 --> 01:22:22,520
And I just vote whatever the fuck other people were voting for?

2279
01:22:26,820 --> 01:22:27,300
Yeah.

2280
01:22:30,200 --> 01:22:32,260
So that's why I'm like...

2281
01:22:32,880 --> 01:22:34,660
But it's not true.

2282
01:22:34,700 --> 01:22:35,760
It depends on the state and the crime.

2283
01:22:36,020 --> 01:22:38,240
You can have 8 out of 10 jurors.

2284
01:22:38,340 --> 01:22:38,800
Oh, okay.

2285
01:22:38,960 --> 01:22:39,660
That's interesting.

2286
01:22:40,380 --> 01:22:40,940
But yeah.

2287
01:22:41,060 --> 01:22:42,060
I feel like...

2288
01:22:42,820 --> 01:22:44,060
I feel like...

2289
01:22:44,060 --> 01:22:46,900
If I didn't want to be there, I would just vote...

2290
01:22:46,900 --> 01:22:49,240
Like to whatever the fuck the majority was.

2291
01:22:49,380 --> 01:22:50,300
Because I just want to leave.

2292
01:22:50,380 --> 01:22:51,700
I don't want to argue my case.

2293
01:22:52,660 --> 01:22:53,560
I was like, no.

2294
01:22:53,860 --> 01:22:55,700
If I see like evidence, I was like, wait a minute.

2295
01:22:55,760 --> 01:22:56,700
Maybe he is guilty.

2296
01:22:57,040 --> 01:22:58,880
But then everyone's like, no, he is innocent.

2297
01:22:59,260 --> 01:23:00,000
And I was like, okay.

2298
01:23:03,380 --> 01:23:04,820
Well, I'm not going to argue about that.

2299
01:23:04,920 --> 01:23:06,540
I'm not going to argue why I think he's guilty.

2300
01:23:06,780 --> 01:23:07,340
All right.

2301
01:23:07,380 --> 01:23:07,840
He's innocent.

2302
01:23:08,360 --> 01:23:08,720
Okay.

2303
01:23:11,460 --> 01:23:11,820
Okay.

2304
01:23:12,560 --> 01:23:12,800
Okay.

2305
01:23:12,800 --> 01:23:13,160
Okay.

2306
01:23:13,160 --> 01:23:13,340
Okay.

2307
01:23:14,580 --> 01:23:14,940
Okay.

2308
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:20,480
I'm just like, all right.

2309
01:23:20,540 --> 01:23:21,940
I got to go home early.

2310
01:23:23,080 --> 01:23:23,640
Yay.

2311
01:23:24,520 --> 01:23:26,540
I get to go home early.

2312
01:23:27,180 --> 01:23:27,740
Woo.

2313
01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:39,640
I know someone who intentionally said something offensive to get rejected from jury duty.

2314
01:23:39,820 --> 01:23:42,620
I don't know why people bail when they get off work for...

2315
01:23:42,620 --> 01:23:44,920
Because for some people, people think jury duty is a crime.

2316
01:23:44,940 --> 01:23:45,900
I guess it's working.

2317
01:23:46,900 --> 01:23:47,680
That's too much.

2318
01:23:47,820 --> 01:23:48,800
I think it, thank you.

2319
01:23:48,960 --> 01:23:57,500
I think it's also because like jury duty is also work, because like, you know, like you have to go to somewhere else.

2320
01:23:57,520 --> 01:23:59,060
You don't get to stay at home.

2321
01:24:00,040 --> 01:24:04,320
Yeah, you don't get to, it's not like you can stay at home for jury duty.

2322
01:24:10,020 --> 01:24:10,800
That's fine.

2323
01:24:14,100 --> 01:24:14,580
Yeah.

2324
01:24:14,680 --> 01:24:14,920
Yeah.

2325
01:24:14,940 --> 01:24:21,680
Oh my god, if you know jury nullification is a concept that exists that can get you disqualified from jury duty...

2326
01:24:21,680 --> 01:24:22,960
Oh my god, guys!

2327
01:24:23,360 --> 01:24:24,760
I gave you an excuse!

2328
01:24:25,860 --> 01:24:26,440
Guys!

2329
01:24:26,540 --> 01:24:31,180
You can be like, I watched a YouTuber explain jury nullification to me.

2330
01:24:31,420 --> 01:24:36,780
And now I know I can have biases with jury duty.

2331
01:24:37,140 --> 01:24:38,420
Oh my god.

2332
01:24:38,920 --> 01:24:40,060
Oh my god.

2333
01:24:40,120 --> 01:24:41,020
You're welcome, chat.

2334
01:24:41,220 --> 01:24:43,120
I literally gave you the perfect excuse.

2335
01:24:43,120 --> 01:24:47,620
I literally gave you the perfect excuse.

2336
01:24:51,460 --> 01:24:53,680
Alright, anyway.

2337
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,260
I think I'm gonna call it here, guys.

2338
01:24:56,400 --> 01:24:58,500
I think I'm gonna call it here.

2339
01:24:58,700 --> 01:25:01,320
I had a great time hanging out with all of you, chat.

2340
01:25:02,600 --> 01:25:06,780
It was... Your Honor, are you familiar with DokiBurr?

2341
01:25:08,890 --> 01:25:12,360
That's about 5,000 people out of jury duty.

2342
01:25:12,520 --> 01:25:13,100
And...

2343
01:25:13,120 --> 01:25:13,520
Hey, guys!

2344
01:25:14,100 --> 01:25:14,940
Tomorrow's a rest day.

2345
01:25:15,060 --> 01:25:17,300
I hope you guys enjoyed this little bonus stream.

2346
01:25:17,580 --> 01:25:21,980
I had a great time hanging out with all of you guys.

2347
01:25:24,120 --> 01:25:28,280
I had a great time hanging out with all of you guys and I hope you guys had a great time chatting with me.

2348
01:25:29,920 --> 01:25:30,780
Tomorrow's my rest day!

2349
01:25:31,060 --> 01:25:34,220
I most likely will have my schedule out maybe tomorrow.

2350
01:25:34,800 --> 01:25:35,880
Tomorrow, most likely.

2351
01:25:36,420 --> 01:25:40,140
Because like, it's already really late and I don't really want to post my schedule that late today.

2352
01:25:41,080 --> 01:25:43,100
So, I'll work on it today and post it for tomorrow.

2353
01:25:43,100 --> 01:25:43,940
But thank you, everybody!

2354
01:25:44,200 --> 01:25:46,160
As always, I hope you guys all have a great Easter!

2355
01:25:46,620 --> 01:25:49,060
As always, everybody, stay hydrated, posture check.

2356
01:25:49,160 --> 01:25:50,980
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

2357
01:25:51,140 --> 01:25:52,820
And if you stay up for me, head to bed.

2358
01:25:52,880 --> 01:25:53,880
Because you deserve it!

2359
01:25:54,020 --> 01:25:55,120
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

2360
01:25:55,900 --> 01:25:56,480
Bye, guys!

2361
01:25:56,800 --> 01:25:57,160
Bye!

2362
01:25:57,820 --> 01:25:59,300
Also, thank you for the super chat, Deadpool!

2363
01:25:59,480 --> 01:26:00,220
Thank you, thank you!

2364
01:26:00,240 --> 01:26:01,280
Thanks for the stream, Doki.

2365
01:26:01,560 --> 01:26:02,620
It's always a pleasure.

2366
01:26:02,860 --> 01:26:04,640
It's always a pleasure to talk to you guys and hang out!

2367
01:26:04,960 --> 01:26:05,520
Bye, everybody!

2368
01:26:05,780 --> 01:26:06,120
Bye!

2369
01:26:06,620 --> 01:26:06,980
Bye!

2370
01:26:06,980 --> 01:26:07,080
Bye!

2371
01:26:07,080 --> 01:26:07,200
Bye!
