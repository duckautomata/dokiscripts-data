1
00:02:50,620 --> 00:03:01,560
hello everybody hello hello welcome to the bonus stream it's
a little bit of a super unexpected gorilla stream as it

2
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:07,160
really be is it really unexpected when i sort of told you
guys i'm going to do a gorilla stream anyway this is more of

3
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:15,040
the chill stream uh because like i wanted to mix it up with
the the back-to-back apex streams that we had all of a

4
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,720
sudden so like to make it up to you guys.

5
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:20,060
I decided to just, like, do a bonus stream today.

6
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,480
Do an extra bonus stream and just hang out with you guys.

7
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,360
Because both Apex streams, they were both, like, collabs.

8
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:28,020
I didn't get to really interact with you guys.

9
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,540
I didn't get to talk to you guys.

10
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,380
They're, like, uh, fuck around a lot with chat.

11
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,360
Um, because I was, like, super... Well, I was semi-focused.

12
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,940
Like, who are we kidding?

13
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,300
I was not super focused on the tournaments.

14
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:39,720
Uh...

15
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,300
If you cast...

16
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:56,660
If you invite a content creator these tournaments you're
never really super focused you're not really okay to be fair

17
00:03:56,660 --> 00:04:05,680
though i'm going to practice more apex though because i
don't want to throw i i don't really i don't really i don't

18
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:14,040
throw the challenger circuit um to be fair today's
tournament was more about like games that were more fucking

19
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:21,700
around than actually serious except for the time when Timmy
yelled at me 30 seconds straight to fucking use my cue and

20
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:24,900
shield and then I did not do that.

21
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,740
That was a little embarrassing.

22
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:27,840
That was my...

23
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,660
That was my moment there in front of everybody.

24
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:37,800
Not just to you guys, but to the normies that watched Timmy
as well.

25
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:40,820
That...

26
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:47,750
I was truly...

27
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:55,190
I was the, I totally left a great impression regarding
VTubers to Timmy's audience.

28
00:04:55,790 --> 00:05:06,110
Truly, truly was the most impact I've ever had towards
Timmy's, uh, uh, towards Timmy's, like, first impressions of

29
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:06,450
me.

30
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:08,810
Definitely, for sure, for sure.

31
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:14,390
I hope, I hope he still enjoyed the time we had.

32
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:16,130
I hope he still enjoyed the time.

33
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:19,690
Thank you for the super chat.

34
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:20,010
Thank you.

35
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:20,470
Thank you.

36
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:22,590
You paid the price for chicken and rice.

37
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:23,650
Thank you for the super chat.

38
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:23,950
Thank you.

39
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:26,950
Thank you Oh, that for chicken and rice guys.

40
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:35,830
I was off my grooves like, you know, I didn't get to talk
the drop before we start the game Look, I'm gonna make a

41
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:44,110
hundred fucking excuses because like as anyone that plays
competitive FPS games before You never blame yourself.

42
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:50,490
You always blame other people and you make a hundred
thousand excuses why you were not the problem in the video

43
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:53,210
game So this was, I'm gonna blame chicken and rice.

44
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:54,450
I'm gonna blame.

45
00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:56,530
It messed with my groove.

46
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:59,750
You know, I didn't get the chance to like get to know drop.

47
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:02,390
So I have to get to know him while we were playing.

48
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:06,010
And then I got messed up because we were getting contested.

49
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:07,790
So I didn't realize they were there.

50
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:13,370
Anton, thank you, the super chat.

51
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:14,250
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

52
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:15,090
Don't keep burning.

53
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:15,770
Thank you, the super chat.

54
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:18,310
And then everything went downhill.

55
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:20,810
All because of chicken.

56
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:32,910
and rice every game after that went downhill it broke
everything it fucked with everything all because of chicken

57
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:44,430
and rice every game after that God fucked with it Mickey
thank you the super chat thank you thank you this is

today but i could have tried a little more i i I could have

69
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:56,370
not tried to get to know drops and like have a conversation
with him I could have just played the game instead of having

70
00:07:56,370 --> 00:08:04,430
a conversation with drops But instead I got a little
distracted Try to have a conversation and I died I could

71
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:18,140
have not had a conversation and just focused I would admit
But I wanted to get away with I wanted to get to know them I

72
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:20,420
don't want it to be like never see you again

73
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:35,480
like um anyway um after after the scars cut we also have
challenger circuit with uh wig and tempo and i definitely

76
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:57,160
actually scrimmed and for those who don't They actually like
do like practice games They do practice games like you know

77
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:05,780
almost every day And then there's me I don't think I have to
explain I don't have I don't think I have to explain more

78
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:13,680
when I say And then there's me So I have to be less of a
content creator And more of like an actual player You know

79
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:22,000
and so oh yeah Also a really funny thing After the
tournament like Jen Burden DM me on Twitter and like he

80
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:30,180
followed me back on Twitter and he was like you're so
fucking funny and honestly when like and like he was like

81
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:36,520
you're so fucking funny I had a great time playing with you
honestly but Australians said that you know and but I think

82
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:44,400
Australians are really fucking hilarious because like I like
I like groove with their sense of humor and they don't they

83
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:57,140
don't give a fuck like Australians like Australians say the
wildest things and like honestly if an Australian says

84
00:09:57,140 --> 00:10:09,560
you're you're really funny like I take that as a fucking
compliment and and then I told him I was like I okay also by

85
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:20,260
the way like uh I know I only released like top 10 of who
won the most money And, like, um, and so, like, so I know

86
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:24,120
how much money I won, and I won more money than Jen Burden.

87
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:31,560
I straight up told him, I was like, oh my God, I actually
made more than, because, like, we joked about it when we had

88
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:38,560
the game, and I was like, I actually made more than you,
this tournament, like, I'm practically a pro player now, and

89
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,300
then Jen Burden was like, wait, no shot.

90
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:54,700
and zero from dark zero which was fucking funny as hell I
honestly I thought it was so fucking funny I actually made

91
00:10:54,700 --> 00:11:08,510
more than zero and Jen burden um in that tournament yeah so
I was like you know what I take that as a win I I take that

92
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:18,010
as a fucking win right there man it's all right just
australian things but i had a great time it was honestly um

93
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:27,730
nice to find i never played it i never played with jen or
timmy or dropped before so like it was definitely an honor

94
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:35,650
to be able to play with them even though for dropped it was
like literally one minute but like you know it was only for

95
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:42,990
a minute with drop that's that's all right but like jen and
like And Timmy, definitely, oh yeah, I'll be remembered by

96
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:47,230
Timmy as a, as a new cast of that wouldn't fucking listen.

97
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,830
The worst, to be fair, to be fair.

98
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:59,610
He had an actual real team during the other three strikes,
but then he got the same placement as us.

99
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:02,570
So in the end, no, he wouldn't have improved.

100
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:11,630
He, like, whatever teammate he got after me, did, It didn't
matter because he didn't even improve his placement.

101
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:19,210
Like, those two teammates that he had were 100% better than
what, like, like, they were literally pro players.

102
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:22,270
Like, he literally had another pro player on his team.

103
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:26,330
And because of that, they still got fifth place.

104
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:27,630
So what does that say?

105
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:28,790
What does that say?

106
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:35,330
I literally play just as well as having another pro player
on his team, except I just don't know the difference between

107
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:36,770
Condit Q and Shield.

108
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:47,010
queue and um and newcastle queue queue okay i'm not a
professional player i'm a content creator how the fuck was i

109
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:51,370
supposed to know he should have said newcastle queue

110
00:12:56,650 --> 00:13:05,650
i was literally waiting for the for the conduit queue the
queue incident i'll never forget it also for those who are

111
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:14,790
uh uh for those who are new here um if you guys didn't know
i got partnered with gamer subs what does that mean it means

00:13:55,230 --> 00:14:01,970
But yeah, huge shout out to gamer subs for sponsoring 5K of
the art contest.

120
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:04,870
And I'm putting in an extra 2K in there.

121
00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:11,550
uh just because i wanted to be able to pick more artists so
at first it was like uh uh because like i want that the

122
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:17,930
reason why i sponsored a 2k more like i added my own 2k in
there is because like i wanted to be able to have more

123
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:22,850
chances to pick artists and stuff and i felt like you know i
feel like there's gonna be a lot of entries i won't be able

124
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:31,350
to make it possible to be able to you know give you guys um
just be able to you know give artists uh more chances to to

125
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:36,930
be picked especially it's really good for like resume and
stuff too If you're an artist that wants to put in your

126
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:42,890
portfolio for, like, design work and stuff like that, like,
if you were able to, if you get chosen, it'd be really good

127
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:44,130
for your portfolio and stuff.

128
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:45,730
And you get money, too!

129
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:47,050
And you get money as well.

130
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:49,630
So, um, it's like a win-win situation.

131
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:50,190
Hate that.

132
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:51,050
Thank you for the super chat.

133
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:51,350
Thank you.

134
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:51,770
Thank you.

135
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:55,370
Tell me what, what do these, uh, gamer suppositories do?

136
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:56,610
Thank you for the super chat.

137
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:56,970
Thank you.

138
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:57,510
Thank you.

139
00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:00,250
Um, I'm not really good at shilling.

140
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:12,310
They sent me a $300 package for free of, like, Gamersup
stuff.

141
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:15,150
So, okay, they go in your mouth, by the way.

142
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:15,890
You drink them.

143
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:17,870
It doesn't go anywhere else in any other holes.

144
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:19,090
You drink these.

145
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:23,810
It's powder that you put in your drink, and then you put
water.

146
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:27,430
Also, apparently, the Gamersup's, like, snack bars are
really good.

147
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:31,550
I haven't had a chance to try it out, but it was in that
package that was sent.

148
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:32,690
And...

149
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:37,030
Because, okay, you know why I clarified?

150
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:38,370
Because he said suppositories.

151
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:44,750
Like, like, if you don't know what suppositories are, you
have to specify where it's going to.

152
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:52,250
Anyway, um, anyway, uh, I was recommending flavors earlier
on in the Apex streams.

153
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:56,730
And I, the current ones, I haven't tried all of them because
it was a lot.

154
00:15:56,890 --> 00:15:58,230
Okay, it was a lot.

155
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:03,010

00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:04,730
I'm not going to read up the actual names.

157
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:10,470
because like apparently people were telling me to try the
guacamole one because apparently the guacamole one is

158
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:16,650
actually really really good but i haven't tried the
guacamole one because of the name the actual name i don't

159
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:19,250
know the name doesn't really appeal to me

160
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:33,260
like everyone's like it's legit really good you have to try
that one this was the best flavor but like but the name

163
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:57,060

193
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:58,300
You know what you can do?

194
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:01,820
You can click on my link and just search up guacamole.

195
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:03,720
That's all you have to do.

196
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:16,620
you have to do guys just switch up guacamole okay anyway by
the way one other show thing uh the lunar new year merch is

197
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:25,360
and pre-order is neck earning next week so make sure you
grab it before it's gone because everything but the but the

198
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:33,040
red pocket will be gone forever so uh so like um if you guys
want to grab some merch some limited merch make sure you get

199
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:40,540
the lunar new year merch I'm trying to wait until I send my
first shipment of merch.

200
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:47,180
I haven't received our first, like, the debut, the old debut
merch yet.

201
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:52,640
So the reason why there hasn't been any new, anything new in
the store or, like, anything.

202
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:57,700
I guess, like, other than that, I am planning on one day
releasing voice packs one day.

203
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:02,300
One day because there's so many things to do.

204
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:06,120
I'm so behind on so many things.

205
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:14,340
but like uh the reason why uh there's going to be a little
uh hiatus with merch new merch orders like not new merch

206
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:23,680
sorry new uh uh merch releases is because I want to be sure
that I've settled with the debut stuff first like I shipped

207
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:30,720
those out first before like I receive them and ship them out
first before I think of new merch um just because like I

208
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:37,820
don't want to like have like a bunch of stuff that's been on
hold you know and everybody's like where is our merch we've

210
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:54,360

still waiting because it takes so long to travel on water

228
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:36,820

Like, who do I call?

233
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:47,560
And then they were like, you can't call them.

234
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:49,040
Go to their office.

235
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:53,820
And I was like, um, where is the office?

236
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:56,540
And then they gave me the address.

237
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:58,840
And then I looked it up.

238
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:02,240
The worst part was.

239
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:05,560
I looked it up and they're closed.

240
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:11,820
They're closed on like Fridays to Mondays because it's a
Canadian hot.

241
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:13,020
It's Easter.

242
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,100
It's fucking Easter.

243
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:19,500
So I can't do anything about it.

244
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:27,200
I was just like, and then like the manufacturer got back to
me and was, because it was like a back to forth with them.

245
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:28,800
And then I was like freaking out.

246
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:34,120
And then the manufacturer got back to me and was like, Hey,
what the fuck is going on?

247
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:41,920
Like, the, like, um, you're supposed to pay the, the custom
taxes by the end of this month.

248
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:43,380
What's going on?

249
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,700
It was like, by the end of this month?

250
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:48,980
Bro, it's not, it's Easter.

251
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:57,800
What do you mean by the end of, it's Easter?

252
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:01,040
How am I, I can't even call them.

253
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:08,520
I was just like How do I even call?

254
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:18,180
They don't even take calls And I was like Because the guy
literally said in the email They don't take calls And I was

255
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:32,160
just like what do you mean They don't take calls I was just
like I can't even call them I have to be there And then And

256
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:37,480
then And then I told the manufacturer, I was like, I don't
know what to do.

257
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:39,400
They don't take calls.

258
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,600
Look at their office hours.

259
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,600
They're closed.

260
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:49,560
And then they're like, okay, we're going to figure this out.

261
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:51,820
And they were like, oh, we got you an extension.

262
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,360
We extended it to Monday.

263
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:56,320

mind that they were so generous enough to extend it to a

Thank you, the Super Chat.

315
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:00,460
Thank you, thank you.

316
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:01,500
Good question.

317
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:09,920
So the reason why the PO Box is still not open yet is
because Mr. Mann is opening the PO Box for me.

318
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:13,680
And he recently moved.

319
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:18,260
And we were dealing with the PO Box stuff.

320
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:23,280
And the reason why it's not open yet is because apparently
the PO Box played.

321
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:36,320
um they require mr man to be on a lease and i don't wait is
it is he doing okay wait um he is legally living somewhere

322
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:43,040
uh he's just he they're just working on his lease right now
just so you guys know he's not living he's not living

323
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:55,220
anywhere illegally just so you guys know i didn't realize
when i said that it sounded really bad It sounded really

324
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:56,160
okay.

325
00:30:57,020 --> 00:31:05,180
Anyway, he is currently because he's like Rooming roommates
with people so he is currently working on his lease at the

326
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:12,660
moment So the moment he is on the lease he can open the PO
box So do not worry.

327
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:18,360
He is living somewhere very legal It's just that it takes
time to be on.

328
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:19,340
I don't know how American.

329
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:20,800
I hope I didn't fuck him

330
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:30,120
I don't even know what American living scenarios are But

331
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:43,740
They're working on it They're working on The moment he's on
the lease We will have the PO box open That is what we're

332
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:53,480
waiting on at the moment That is what we're working on And
like I asked him I was like how long does the lease take And

333
00:31:53,480 --> 00:32:09,340
I also asked his roommate, because, like, you know, just in
case, just in case, and like, the roommate said it would be

334
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:13,160
like, it's like, don't worry, everything's going on track.

335
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:22,140
It would be, it would be done either by the end of the
month, by this month, end of this month, or beginning of the

336
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:23,220
week for next month.

337
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:33,260
So, so we're just waiting on that and then the moment he's
on the lease We have our PO box Because you're sending,

338
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:44,000
remember I'm telling, remember reminding you guys this The
PO box is where Mr. Man lives And like, um, so, or near,

339
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:51,540
yeah, so it's always I mean, we need his lease Anyway, I was
just like, did I dox Mr. Man?

340
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:57,680
Well, anyway Um, this is where Mr. Matt is located.

341
00:32:58,760 --> 00:32:59,800
And, um...

342
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:10,640
And, it's where, it's where he's located.

343
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:16,800
And because of that, um, you're sending stuff to where he's
located.

344
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:19,380
And so he can, like, check it.

345
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,360
And then, uh...

346
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:32,180
box it's a PO box so so basically he is gonna be looking
through the mail by the way we're gonna have like rules and

347
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:40,780
regulations regarding the PO box so one thing is you can't
send us food you can't send us any liquids or food and then

348
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:47,700
the other thing is like um we won't be accepting any like I

349
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:54,160

also no food and like he's gonna be like screening

350
00:33:54,160 --> 00:34:06,060

trying to survive out there in the indie world

399
00:39:47,350 --> 00:39:55,970

to do so much stuff to be like i guess like relevant in the

400
00:39:55,970 --> 00:40:04,850
indie world because you're you you don't have like a company
or brand like under you so then you have to uh you have to

like you know be have a brand to serve that's like able to
survive as a solo like i'm biancé

What's Sporty Spice's name?

417
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:38,460
Everyone remembers Posh Spice's name because she married
David Beckham.

418
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,500
But who the fuck is Sporty Spice name?

None of you But everyone remembers Victoria Beckham Like
You're so Everyone remembers Victoria Beckham No one

422
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:07,280

00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:55,280
Like, she was a badass.

428
00:42:55,780 --> 00:42:57,880
You don't even remember her.

429
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:01,120
You just remember her as a group.

430
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:04,520
And that is why I am scared.

431
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:08,580
That is why I am scared.

432
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:11,080
Um.

433
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:13,700
Alright, anyway.

434
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:14,620

00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:24,720
does Melanie people know Melanie in the UK maybe all right
what what songs has Melanie sang what songs has Melanie

436

00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:17,060
She's like the perfect queen right now.

444

470
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:12,700
definitely will be tryharding more for next week.

471
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:15,460
So I'll be practicing more Apex because I was like...

472
00:47:15,460 --> 00:47:17,580
I've been slacking with my practice.

473
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:19,440
Because like...

474
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:21,620
I had a lot of stuff to do.

475
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:23,940
I had a lot of stuff to do.

476
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:25,640
Like back to back to back to back.

477
00:47:26,020 --> 00:47:30,620
But I'm getting a lot of things done recently.

478
00:47:31,220 --> 00:47:34,300
And that I was like super like...

479
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:35,880
That like took up most of my time.

480
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:37,600
And a lot of the things that took up a lot of my time.

481
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:39,660
Is like I don't have to deal with it anymore.

482
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:42,640
So, like, I'll be definitely be practicing more Apex.

483
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:45,980
Because the next two tournaments are very...

484
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:49,580
Are very actual try-hards.

485
00:47:50,540 --> 00:47:53,120
Actual... Actual... I have to try now.

486
00:47:53,260 --> 00:47:54,880
I have to actually try.

487
00:47:58,400 --> 00:47:59,280
But, yes.

488
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:03,880
So, Nico, I'm down to play with him in the future one day.

489
00:48:04,460 --> 00:48:06,800
Just because, like, right now, like, the reason why...

490
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,940
I haven't had really much, like, repeats.

491
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:17,140
reach out to me because I want to try and interact with as
many new people as possible every week.

492
00:48:17,620 --> 00:48:20,460
I didn't know what would go me because we had a fucking long
ass game to complete.

493
00:48:21,980 --> 00:48:28,620
But in that, I've been trying to reach out to new people
every week to collab with because I want to, like, you know,

494
00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:29,700
get to know more people.

495
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:36,220
I want to have, like, people to collaborate with in the
future with other games, any multiplayer games and stuff.

496
00:48:36,660 --> 00:48:40,540
So, just slowly meeting more and more new people Every week.

497
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:41,440
That's my goal.

498
00:48:41,820 --> 00:48:43,700
Every week I want to meet a new person.

499
00:48:44,740 --> 00:48:47,160
This week I met a lot of new people, that's for sure.

500
00:48:48,340 --> 00:48:49,940
But it was great to finally play with Jen.

501
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,680
I do want to say, like, I've always wanted to play with
Timmy.

502
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:53,880
I've always wanted to play with Jen.

503
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:59,420
And because they're, like, Apex streamers I've watched, you
know, even back in the day.

504
00:48:59,780 --> 00:49:04,160
I watched, like, Timmy and Jen a lot back in the day.

505
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:06,620
And so it was nice to be able to play with them.

506
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:08,120
It was definitely a...

507
00:49:09,820 --> 00:49:20,020
stream come true type deal um because oh my god speaking of
okay this is like a different topic but like um um i

508
00:49:20,020 --> 00:49:27,920
actually had like uh one of my super old friends i haven't
talked to this person in a long long long long time but they

509
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:33,700
were one of my like friends that first made playing
overwatch uh they used to be like a big overwatch content

510
00:49:33,700 --> 00:49:39,980

511
00:49:39,980 --> 00:49:47,180

512
00:49:47,180 --> 00:49:55,620

league is gone now and now they established face it uh which

513
00:49:55,620 --> 00:50:01,960

not sure i don't i don't know i know like face it is like a

514
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:09,560
csgo thing but they made a face it for overwatch rank
Overwatch rank I don't know they made it face it for

515
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:16,300
Overwatch and they like message me they like DM me about it
and was like we should do it we're what and I was like I'm

516
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:34,740
fucking and it I was like bro bro I'm fucking washed I don't
even have Elari or like Lifeweaver unlocked Like, what the

517
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:35,340
fuck?

518
00:50:37,460 --> 00:50:39,980
I literally said, bro, Lamau.

519
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:41,860
I'm fucking washed, bro.

520
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:42,880
What the fuck?

521
00:50:43,420 --> 00:50:47,320
And then they were like, no, man, it'll be fun.

522
00:50:47,460 --> 00:50:49,360
So I haven't responded back after that.

523
00:50:49,740 --> 00:50:51,180
But I'll think about it.

524
00:50:51,460 --> 00:50:55,080
I'll think about it.

525
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:05,740
There's always, I'm not giving Overwatch has too much of my
money because back then I was a young fool.

526
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:13,340
Back then, I was young, naive, and I actually spent money on
Overwatch accounts and boxes.

527
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:19,760
Now, now, now I'm not spending money on Overwatch.

528
00:51:20,580 --> 00:51:30,080
You need to know, I had so many Overwatch, the amount of
money I gave Overwatch in name changes and accounts and loot

529
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:32,100
boxes was way too many.

530
00:51:32,100 --> 00:51:34,580
I am not fucking buying Elari.

531
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:38,680
I'm not buying to unlock Elari and Lifeweaver.

532
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:42,920
I'll fucking play the game and unlock them if I have to.

533
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:44,320
And it's a hundred games.

534
00:51:44,540 --> 00:51:45,740
You need to play 50 games.

535
00:51:45,980 --> 00:51:47,000
You know what I didn't realize?

536
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:49,700
Do you know what I didn't fucking realize?

537
00:51:50,060 --> 00:51:53,680
You need to like, to unlock a character.

538
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:55,860
You have to click on the character.

539
00:51:56,440 --> 00:51:57,940
And then you have to click unlock.

540
00:51:58,380 --> 00:52:02,060
Like, you have to be like, you have to click on the
character and do like, do the challenges.

541
00:52:02,100 --> 00:52:03,640
for that character.

542
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:13,280
So, because I thought, I thought when you play games, it
automatically registers as like what?

543
00:52:13,540 --> 00:52:14,920
The support character?

544
00:52:15,940 --> 00:52:23,600
I didn't realize you have to click on the hero and to click,
do the challenges for those heroes.

545
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:27,200
Because I was like, oh man, I did 20 games.

546
00:52:27,540 --> 00:52:27,840
Yay.

547
00:52:28,340 --> 00:52:31,360
And then I clicked on Illari and it said zero out of 50.

548
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:48,740
I was like Yay I did 20 games Of Overwatch I was like okay I
didn't know it was 20 I was like yay I played a lot of games

549
00:52:48,740 --> 00:52:55,680

the icons again that's just uh not gonna lie no wonder like

556
00:54:03,690 --> 00:54:11,070
they changed up the reward system Overwatch sponsor me and
then I'll I won't talk like this about Overwatch

557
00:54:15,290 --> 00:54:30,090
I love Overwatch because you guys started my career um
anyway um anyway as I was saying as I was saying as I was

558
00:54:30,090 --> 00:54:43,650
saying um um I was looking at the rewards on on overwatch
and i was so fucking surprised how much if like how much it

559
00:54:43,650 --> 00:54:50,810
felt like the the reward system for top up did you know they
try to make it like okay i was looking at the icons by my

560
00:54:50,810 --> 00:54:58,750
silence yes i was looking at the icons and i was so
surprised okay before i mentioned more before you guys were

561
00:54:58,750 --> 00:55:08,050
like wow doki what a sellout i want you to say i want to say
everything i've said is not as worse as everything actual

562
00:55:08,050 --> 00:55:12,010
Overwatch content creators and actual Overwatch pros have
said about the game.

563
00:55:12,390 --> 00:55:16,610
And they have been sponsored and have been paid to promote
the game much more than me.

564
00:55:27,630 --> 00:55:32,310
They play the game professionally and some of them are like
Overwatch content creators.

565
00:55:32,750 --> 00:55:36,570
And I swear to God, they have said worse things than what
I've said.

566
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:50,170
Anyway, anyway, um, anyway, as I was saying, as I was
saying, the fucking Overwatch icons, I was so, I was so

567
00:55:50,170 --> 00:55:51,750
fucking surprised.

568
00:55:53,010 --> 00:56:04,010
I was so, I was so surprised because back then, back then in
Overwatch, like, the early top 500 prizes were really good.

569
00:56:04,010 --> 00:56:12,530
like the animated sprays and the and the fucking icons were
really really fucking pretty now like back in overwatch one

570
00:56:12,530 --> 00:56:21,170
it was like now like in the final seasons in overwatch ones
they it was like weapons so like if you don't get if you

571
00:56:21,170 --> 00:56:28,950
don't get top 500 you get like a normal weapon icon like a
like like tracer's weapon it's just tracer's weapon but if

572
00:56:28,950 --> 00:56:31,450
you get top 500 it's gold

573
00:56:34,910 --> 00:56:44,130
it looks terrible it's just the same thing it's just a color
change in the in the early top 500 days it's like a

574
00:56:44,130 --> 00:56:51,290
different scenery of the icon and it actually has the top
500 icon and the top 500 icon is like right in the middle

575
00:56:51,290 --> 00:56:59,110
fucking huge it was right in the middle and then you can
also the jade weapons too oh my god why would i have a jade

576
00:56:59,110 --> 00:57:03,390
weapon when i could have a gold weapon Why do I want my item
to be fucking green?

577
00:57:03,750 --> 00:57:05,630
I'm sorry if your favorite color is green.

578
00:57:05,810 --> 00:57:07,630
I'm so sorry.

579
00:57:12,450 --> 00:57:14,230
What do I want?

Because I wanted all the sub-batches to be, like, universal.

620
01:00:04,330 --> 01:00:07,030

626
01:00:49,350 --> 01:00:51,210
Maybe longer, but we've been artists friends.

627
01:00:51,350 --> 01:00:52,210
We met on DeviantArt.

01:00:55,690 --> 01:00:57,990
We, the cursed site now.

629
01:00:58,530 --> 01:01:01,350
It has, that site has gone downhill.

630
01:01:01,590 --> 01:01:03,070
I'm surprised it's still around.

631
01:01:03,250 --> 01:01:06,150
I'm sorry, but I'm surprised DeviantArt is still fucking
around.

632
01:01:07,270 --> 01:01:16,950
and DeviantArt and um we've been artist friends for a while
uh when I was in uh when I was like you know when I started

actually lost uh lost contact not lost contact but we've um

634
01:01:25,850 --> 01:01:34,210

years uh because I was so busy and um I was really really

635
01:01:34,210 --> 01:01:43,010

01:04:34,630 --> 01:04:37,110
I haven't replied back to their text yet.

664
01:04:38,490 --> 01:04:43,270
But this is an old friend that I basically got in one season
in Overwatch.

665
01:04:43,590 --> 01:04:45,090
I got like top 500 with her.

666
01:04:45,210 --> 01:04:46,130
We would do a support.

667
01:04:46,430 --> 01:04:50,470
We would do a support together in Overwatch 1.

668
01:04:52,390 --> 01:04:54,590
And we got top 500 together.

669
01:04:55,890 --> 01:05:02,770
And like, like she reached out to me and was like, hey,
like, um, we saw everything that's happening, like, like,

you know, hang out and just catch up and everything.

672
01:05:18,910 --> 01:05:24,050
I was like, I haven't responded back, but I thought, like,
it was, I went to, like, BlizzCon with her, too.

673
01:05:25,990 --> 01:05:28,250
That was how long ago it was.

674
01:05:28,570 --> 01:05:29,770
It was so long ago.

675
01:05:29,890 --> 01:05:32,510
Like, she was, like, actually one of my best friends in
Overwatch.

676
01:05:32,930 --> 01:05:34,850
But we lost, like, we lost...

677
01:05:34,850 --> 01:05:35,590
What's that word?

678
01:05:36,050 --> 01:05:36,690
Lost touch?

679
01:05:36,970 --> 01:05:37,610
Is that it?

680
01:05:37,750 --> 01:05:40,790
We lost touch after Overwatch sort of died.

681
01:05:40,930 --> 01:05:41,930
Not die, sort of died.

682
01:05:41,990 --> 01:05:43,630
But, like, after, like, we both...

683
01:05:43,630 --> 01:05:46,050
Like, she had to go, like, to...

684
01:05:46,050 --> 01:05:49,370
She had to, like, focus on studies and stuff.

685
01:05:49,470 --> 01:05:51,670
And then I moved on to Apex.

686
01:05:51,790 --> 01:05:52,850
Like, I lost contact.

687
01:05:52,970 --> 01:05:54,190
Yeah, we lost contact.

688
01:05:54,250 --> 01:05:55,570
But she was, like, actually...

689
01:05:55,590 --> 01:05:58,010
One of my best friends in Overwatch 1.

690
01:05:58,590 --> 01:06:01,410
And, like, it was really nice that she reached out to me and
stuff, too.

01:06:01,790 --> 01:06:03,510
So, yeah, I should text her back soon.

I should text her back soon.

693
01:06:07,380 --> 01:06:09,560
It was just really nice, you know.

694
01:06:09,580 --> 01:06:16,580
It was really nice that a lot of my older friends reached
out to me to talk and just, like, wanted to hang out and

695
01:06:16,580 --> 01:06:16,860
stuff.

696
01:06:16,980 --> 01:06:17,900
So, it was really nice.

697
01:06:18,360 --> 01:06:24,360

so busy and i really appreciate all my old friends like uh
reaching out to me and everything and like being very

712
01:08:25,220 --> 01:08:32,660

like i didn't have a chance to like talk much to a lot of my

713
01:08:32,660 --> 01:08:39,800
old friends and everything and um so it's really nice that a
lot of them like reached out and stuff like that like and

714
01:08:39,800 --> 01:08:47,740
was like super understanding with Like, like, we're just me
being like, uh, me being anti-social.

715
01:08:49,280 --> 01:08:54,300
I mean, me being very anti-social and stuff.

716
01:08:54,720 --> 01:09:00,920
So I really, I really appreciate it, appreciate it too.

717
01:09:01,800 --> 01:09:02,320
And yeah.

718
01:09:05,680 --> 01:09:07,560

Thank you.

721
01:09:08,680 --> 01:09:11,720
As a doctor, I can assure you, Doki, no, we don't make a lot
of money.

722
01:09:11,740 --> 01:09:16,860
money really it was all a lie like

723
01:09:20,520 --> 01:09:29,860
Asian parents lie to me why the fuck do they always want you
to be a doctor

724
01:09:33,640 --> 01:09:50,140
it's always doctor or lawyer no way I always thought doctor
lawyer But you don't make a lot of money Oh my god I feel

725
01:09:50,140 --> 01:10:00,420
like The world is just a lie It's just To be fair Like it
must suck to be a doctor in America Because of student loans

726
01:10:00,420 --> 01:10:09,660
I would just say that like It must take you fucking years to
make back The amount of money That it takes to pay off Your

727
01:10:09,660 --> 01:10:19,720
student loans for lawyer and doctor because there's a lot of
schooling like there's there's a lot of school involved to

728
01:10:19,720 --> 01:10:32,800
that yeah i can't believe people will spread misinformation
about it if you're a millennial right now tell your children

729
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:41,720
the truth is that crazy millennials now are having kids i'm
sorry millennials if you don't have a kid

730
01:10:48,120 --> 01:10:55,640
Millennials are at an age that they should have kids They
should have doesn't mean they should They should have

731
01:10:55,640 --> 01:10:59,360
doesn't mean you have to Sorry English is my first language

732
01:11:03,960 --> 01:11:14,680
But anyway Anyway Millennials don't tell your kids That
being a lawyer or doctor is a way actually you don't have to

733
01:11:14,680 --> 01:11:30,720
because because be a millennial sucks now because like we
can't afford houses and like you know fucking sucks because

734
01:11:30,720 --> 01:11:39,240
you know house market housing market sucks uh uh we can
barely afford anything

735
01:11:45,880 --> 01:11:47,780
So why can't you afford children?

736
01:11:51,320 --> 01:11:55,420
Why the fuck will we be able to afford children's
universities?

737
01:11:57,020 --> 01:11:57,380
Chat.

738
01:11:57,820 --> 01:11:58,800
University is very expensive.

739
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:03,840
Like, like, millennials can barely afford their own
university tuition.

740
01:12:04,060 --> 01:12:05,500
Let her, actually, they can.

741
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:06,520
They can.

742
01:12:07,020 --> 01:12:08,380
That's why student loans exist.

743
01:12:09,100 --> 01:12:10,920
That's why student loans fucking exist.

744
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,400
afford fucking student tuition.

745
01:12:14,660 --> 01:12:17,640
So why the fuck would they afford the kids student tuition?

746
01:12:18,180 --> 01:12:20,200
Don't tell them to be doctors or lawyers.

747
01:12:20,840 --> 01:12:22,560
Tell them to go to computer science.

748
01:12:27,060 --> 01:12:31,060
Tell them to get into computer science or end.

749
01:12:31,140 --> 01:12:33,120
Wait, actually does engineers make a lot of money?

750
01:12:33,280 --> 01:12:33,460
No.

751
01:12:33,640 --> 01:12:37,980
If doctors and lawyers can't make a lot of money, so do
engineers.

752
01:12:38,460 --> 01:12:38,860
Compsi!

753
01:12:39,200 --> 01:12:40,180
That's the way to go!

754
01:12:40,620 --> 01:12:41,140
Compsi!

755
01:12:42,140 --> 01:12:43,520
Silicon Valley.

756
01:12:44,620 --> 01:12:45,160
There we go.

757
01:12:45,440 --> 01:12:46,560
We figured it out.

758
01:12:47,420 --> 01:12:49,300
ComSci is the new lawyer doctor.

759
01:12:50,220 --> 01:12:50,960
Computer science.

760
01:12:51,720 --> 01:12:53,000
New lawyer doctor.

761
01:12:54,040 --> 01:12:56,760
And Silicon Valley.

762
01:12:57,940 --> 01:12:58,600
That's the goal.

763
01:12:59,660 --> 01:13:00,900
It's so real.

764
01:13:01,660 --> 01:13:03,940
I like that someone's like, computer science here.

765
01:13:04,080 --> 01:13:04,620
It sucks.

766
01:13:05,040 --> 01:13:05,400
Yes.

767
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:09,300
But you don't have to get a master's degree.

768
01:13:10,140 --> 01:13:11,720
And then get a doctorate.

769
01:13:11,740 --> 01:13:12,060
it.

770
01:13:12,320 --> 01:13:13,740
You don't have to go to more school.

771
01:13:15,500 --> 01:13:17,120
Computer science is flooded at the moment.

772
01:13:17,380 --> 01:13:19,540
The thing is, okay, you're right.

773
01:13:20,340 --> 01:13:20,780
Technical school.

774
01:13:21,740 --> 01:13:22,180
There we go.

775
01:13:22,300 --> 01:13:23,420
I figured it out, chat.

776
01:13:24,240 --> 01:13:33,400
Tell your children to be plumbers and like, um, to be
plumbers and like anything else in technical school.

777
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:35,720
Trade school and trade school.

778
01:13:36,460 --> 01:13:36,920
Because!

779
01:13:37,820 --> 01:13:38,240
Oh.

780
01:13:38,580 --> 01:13:40,640
I know I'm going to reference a South Park episode.

781
01:13:41,060 --> 01:13:50,080
Because now days we can't do shit anymore like we can't we
we can't do shit anymore we always need to call somebody to

782
01:13:50,080 --> 01:13:58,680
do stuff for us so now trade school is like much more
demanding because like trade school like jobs are now in

783
01:13:58,680 --> 01:14:04,100
demand because no one wants to do things their own no one
knows how to do shit on their own anymore which is true

784
01:14:04,100 --> 01:14:10,280
because i'm that person i need to call somebody to do stuff
like i don't know how to fucking fix feel like watch a

785
01:14:10,280 --> 01:14:17,460
tutorial i still don't fucking know like i rather call
someone it's a trade school time tell your children to go

786
01:14:17,460 --> 01:14:27,100
into trade school and the best part is when your child knows
how to fix the toilet or do like plumbing it'd be a handyman

787
01:14:27,100 --> 01:14:38,460
you don't have to call anybody you can just be like i'm your
mom i gave birth to you fix my toilet and then like you know

788
01:14:38,460 --> 01:14:51,840
with a little bit of therapy for the child after that like
you just balance it off with therapy don't don't talk to

789
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:59,380
your child like that because maybe you have to pay for your
therapy but like um so just say be like oh sweetie hey um

790
01:14:59,380 --> 01:15:07,440
mom's got a leaking faucet Do you want to, do you want to
like, you know, oh man, I mean, oh, I try to call the

791
01:15:07,440 --> 01:15:17,100
handyman and everything, but like, they're so backed up
right now, and it's like so expensive, son, it's so

792
01:15:17,100 --> 01:15:18,180
expensive.

793
01:15:19,660 --> 01:15:21,540
I just don't know what to do.

794
01:15:22,100 --> 01:15:28,500
And then your son is going to be like, don't worry, mom, I
can come over and fix your, well, did I say toilet plumbing

795
01:15:28,500 --> 01:15:28,740
issue?

796
01:15:28,780 --> 01:15:30,040
I don't remember, whatever's fine.

797
01:15:30,380 --> 01:15:31,740
I can fix your plumbing issue.

798
01:15:31,840 --> 01:15:33,580
Don't spend money on that.

799
01:15:33,980 --> 01:15:35,820
That's why I went to trade school.

800
01:15:36,420 --> 01:15:37,400
And then, bam!

801
01:15:38,020 --> 01:15:39,480
You saved money.

802
01:15:45,780 --> 01:15:47,300
We did it!

803
01:15:47,480 --> 01:15:49,340
We solved the issue.

804
01:15:50,440 --> 01:15:52,880
I'm getting PTSD.

805
01:15:56,540 --> 01:15:57,300
Look at that.

806
01:15:57,420 --> 01:15:58,380
That's what you do.

807
01:15:59,620 --> 01:16:01,180
I'm giving you life tips.

808
01:16:01,840 --> 01:16:03,460
Guys, write this down.

809
01:16:03,940 --> 01:16:06,220
I'm actually giving you life tips right now.

810
01:16:07,100 --> 01:16:09,500
Tell your children to go to trade school.

811
01:16:12,280 --> 01:16:14,080
Instead of doctor, lawyer.

812
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:15,820
It's not worth it.

813
01:16:17,280 --> 01:16:19,100
Student loan sign.

814
01:16:20,900 --> 01:16:22,300
Ria, thank you for the super chat.

815
01:16:22,540 --> 01:16:22,660
Thank you.

816
01:16:22,760 --> 01:16:23,500
Thank you.

817
01:16:24,120 --> 01:16:25,440
Nia, thank you for the super chat.

818
01:16:25,620 --> 01:16:25,740
Thank you.

819
01:16:26,100 --> 01:16:26,320
Thank you.

820
01:16:26,680 --> 01:16:29,460
ComSci is also struggling because companies overexpanded.

821
01:16:29,660 --> 01:16:30,260
And now everyone's...

822
01:16:30,260 --> 01:16:31,820
Oh yeah, I heard everyone's getting laid out.

823
01:16:31,840 --> 01:16:39,000
off now it's much harder for new grads to get jobs i think
like that's just not comp side it's everything that's that's

824
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:50,500
definitely not just comp side it's everything everybody's
downsizing now not just comp side uh uh hey dang in the

825
01:16:50,500 --> 01:16:59,680
super chat thank you thank you ducky to remind me to not pay
student list i basically get free school like hey okay okay

826
01:16:59,680 --> 01:17:03,220
legally just pay for it When it's legal.

827
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:06,540
If it's legal and you have to pay for it, pay for it.

828
01:17:06,680 --> 01:17:10,620
If like avoiding student loans is legal, please don't commit
illegal acts.

829
01:17:11,080 --> 01:17:11,240
Thank you.

830
01:17:11,860 --> 01:17:12,840
Thank you.

831
01:17:13,060 --> 01:17:13,780
What was it?

832
01:17:14,200 --> 01:17:14,840
Oh my gosh.

833
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:18,100
There was like a channel for illegal life hacks and stuff.

834
01:17:18,180 --> 01:17:18,740
Oh my god.

835
01:17:19,020 --> 01:17:20,240
I had a short record.

836
01:17:20,340 --> 01:17:23,060
I had like a shorts channel recommended to me.

837
01:17:23,460 --> 01:17:27,280
And then it was like illegal life hacks with like SpongeBob
and Patrick.

838
01:17:27,360 --> 01:17:28,240
I don't know why.

839
01:17:28,660 --> 01:17:31,700
It was like the channel was run by SpongeBob.

840
01:17:32,580 --> 01:17:36,560
SpongeBob and and Patrick AI voices.

841
01:17:37,300 --> 01:17:38,740
Did you guys see that channel?

842
01:17:39,580 --> 01:17:41,820
Or am I just a freak that got recommended?

843
01:17:43,480 --> 01:17:44,660
I'm just a freak.

844
01:17:44,860 --> 01:17:45,060
Let's see.

845
01:17:45,460 --> 01:17:49,240
Sponge illegal life hacks.

846
01:17:51,720 --> 01:17:52,200
SpongeBob.

847
01:17:53,900 --> 01:17:55,580
It had a lot of subscribers.

848
01:17:56,380 --> 01:18:00,220
It has like almost half a million subscribers chat.

849
01:18:00,340 --> 01:18:07,660
This is like, okay, this This is like the channel, the
shorts that I kept getting like, like recommended for, like

850
01:18:07,660 --> 01:18:08,300
this one.

851
01:18:08,880 --> 01:18:16,280
This is like, um, basically they give you like illegal life
hacks as SpongeBob Patrick AI.

852
01:18:16,580 --> 01:18:17,780
I don't know why.

853
01:18:19,580 --> 01:18:22,000
Oh yeah, unethical life tips.

854
01:18:22,160 --> 01:18:22,880
Yeah, unethical.

855
01:18:23,020 --> 01:18:26,960
Yeah, it was like unethical life tips, uh, life hacks.

856
01:18:27,380 --> 01:18:31,820
And okay, like I gave an, I gave an unethical life hack.

857
01:18:31,840 --> 01:18:38,460
Whereas, like, if you get summoned for Jury Duty, just,
like, convince them that you have a bi- Because, like, for

858
01:18:38,460 --> 01:18:45,240
those who didn't hear this, because I said this on Twitch,
basically, like, to be in Jury Duty, you have to have zero

859
01:18:45,240 --> 01:18:45,880
biases.

860
01:18:47,800 --> 01:18:52,800
You have to have zero biases for, for, like, the trial.

861
01:18:53,080 --> 01:18:55,920
So you shouldn't have, you should not swing over one or the
other.

862
01:18:56,300 --> 01:18:59,840
Because if you have a bias, it will become a mistrial.

863
01:19:00,220 --> 01:19:05,400
Because if you're like, oh, I knew it, I knew that person
was guilty the moment they walk in.

864
01:19:05,800 --> 01:19:06,960
That you will give up.

865
01:19:07,020 --> 01:19:08,240
You will make it a mistrial.

866
01:19:08,440 --> 01:19:09,460
Even if they are guilty.

867
01:19:10,960 --> 01:19:13,200
Even if they are like guilty, guilty.

868
01:19:14,180 --> 01:19:17,620
You cannot admit that you have a bias towards something.

869
01:19:18,280 --> 01:19:18,520
So like.

870
01:19:24,940 --> 01:19:31,820
So so basically like, you know, if you get summoned to, you
know, you just be like, you know, I...

871
01:19:31,840 --> 01:19:33,300
I feel...

872
01:19:34,700 --> 01:19:38,680
Just be like, well, I, you know, I don't know.

873
01:19:39,120 --> 01:19:41,940
I don't think that person's a bad guy, even though...

874
01:19:46,100 --> 01:19:48,640
I just be like, I don't know, never met...

875
01:19:48,640 --> 01:19:51,180
I don't know, he just, he seems pretty innocent, you know?

876
01:19:51,400 --> 01:19:54,020
He seems pretty, seems pretty innocent.

877
01:19:58,280 --> 01:20:01,360
And then, and then...

878
01:20:01,840 --> 01:20:07,920
and then the judge would be like yeah we're not picking
they're not we're not picking this person to be on the jury

879
01:20:07,920 --> 01:20:16,020
but that's only if you really just so just if you really
don't want to be on jury duty because you don't really want

880
01:20:16,020 --> 01:20:25,840
to be in jury duty to be fair though you can't i feel like
okay okay but to be like perfectly honest if you get

881
01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:32,940
somebody that doesn't want to be on jury duty on jury duty i
feel like that hurts your case more than like like more than

882
01:20:32,940 --> 01:20:42,340
yeah oh sorry the lawyers do oh but you have to convince the
judge to take you uh but i just feel like if you hate jury

883
01:20:42,340 --> 01:20:51,960
duty and you get into jury duty i feel like like you know it
hurts the the the trial more than helps because like they

884
01:20:51,960 --> 01:21:04,840
don't want to be there like they don't want to You want
people that actually are willing to, you know, like the

885
01:21:04,840 --> 01:21:05,780
justice system.

886
01:21:06,140 --> 01:21:06,420
You know?

887
01:21:06,840 --> 01:21:11,480
You want someone that actually likes the justice system and,
like, has zero biases.

888
01:21:11,920 --> 01:21:20,600
Because what if, like, because the thing about jury duty is
that, by the way, like, if please correct me if I'm wrong,

889
01:21:21,080 --> 01:21:25,300
because majority of what I know about jury duty is from TV
shows.

890
01:21:25,820 --> 01:21:31,820
And just, like, really.

891
01:21:31,840 --> 01:21:37,640
reading a little bit about it like just reading a little bit
so please if you're a lawyer correct me and or a judge

892
01:21:37,640 --> 01:21:49,040
correct me if i'm wrong but like i'm assuming like the part
that's right was where like the jury has to be unified it

893
01:21:49,040 --> 01:22:00,620
has to be like unified in their decision so i feel like you
know um if you don't want to be in jury duty and like and

894
01:22:00,620 --> 01:22:02,820
the decision has to be universal?

895
01:22:03,860 --> 01:22:05,660
What if I just vote for the majority?

896
01:22:06,380 --> 01:22:07,240
Or unanimous, yeah.

897
01:22:07,380 --> 01:22:10,420
What if I just vote for the majority because I want this to
fucking end?

898
01:22:11,900 --> 01:22:14,800
Because if you don't, you like prolong the trial.

899
01:22:15,360 --> 01:22:17,620
You prolong the jury duty.

900
01:22:18,100 --> 01:22:23,200
So what if I just want to leave and I just vote whatever the
fuck other people were voting for?

901
01:22:29,380 --> 01:22:29,820
Yeah.

902
01:22:30,560 --> 01:22:37,420
So that's why I'm like um but it's different it's not true
it depends on state and the crime you can have eight out of

903
01:22:37,420 --> 01:22:46,380
ten jury oh okay that's that's interesting but yeah i feel
like um i feel like uh if i didn't want to be there i would

904
01:22:46,380 --> 01:22:53,280
just vote like to whatever the fuck the majority was because
i just want to leave i don't want to argue my case i was

905
01:22:53,280 --> 01:22:58,720
like no if i see like evidence i was like wait a minute
maybe he is guilty but then everyone's like no he is

906
01:22:58,720 --> 01:23:00,240
innocent and i was like okay

907
01:23:03,420 --> 01:23:04,940
Well, I'm not going to argue about that.

908
01:23:05,020 --> 01:23:06,740
I'm not going to argue why I think he's guilty.

909
01:23:07,240 --> 01:23:08,280
All right, he's innocent.

910
01:23:14,800 --> 01:23:22,260
All right, I'm just like, all right, I got to go home early.

911
01:23:23,500 --> 01:23:23,800
Yay.

912
01:23:24,860 --> 01:23:27,080
I get to go home early.

913
01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:41,560
I know someone who intentionally said something offensive to
get rejected from jury duty I don't know why people bail

914
01:23:41,560 --> 01:23:49,880
when they get off work for because for some people people
think jury duty is work thank you thank you I think it's

915
01:23:49,880 --> 01:23:58,420
also because like jury duty is also work because like you
know like you have to go to somewhere else you don't get to

916
01:23:58,420 --> 01:24:04,700
stay at home yeah you don't get you know it's not like you
can stay at home for jury duty

917
01:24:10,300 --> 01:24:11,260
