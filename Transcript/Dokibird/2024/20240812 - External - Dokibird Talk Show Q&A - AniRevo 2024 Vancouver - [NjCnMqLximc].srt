1
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:12,890
Bro, bro.

2
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:18,060
How's everyone doing this morning?

3
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:18,580
You guys alright?

4
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:22,360
I'm alright.

5
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:23,460
I said, is everyone alright?

6
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,440
What a good way to start the morning, huh?

7
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:33,480
Oh my goodness.

8
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:34,580
It's very exciting.

9
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:38,160
So, obviously you all know why you're here today.

10
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:39,100
Yes?

11
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:39,920
Some of you?

12
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:40,680
Yeah.

13
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:42,140
I don't know.

14
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:42,840
Some of you guys know.

15
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:43,660
I don't know about all of you.

16
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,300
But, so today is a Q&A panel with a thief.

17
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,600
It's also secretly a tomato.

18
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:56,160
But, there are some ground rules.

19
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:56,920
Okay?

20
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:03,680
She's very kind and is fully allowing pictures and recording just like tomorrow.

21
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,440
Just don't disturb your neighbors.

22
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:07,920
Only ground rules you guys have.

23
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:08,500
Sound good?

24
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:11,180
Awesome.

25
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:11,600
Okay.

26
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:14,280
So, a little bit of a breakdown.

27
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,360
Because you have a couple of minutes to kill.

28
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,520
This is how it's just going to go down.

29
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:21,320
I am going to be down here.

30
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:27,660
And I, with our special guest's help, will pick a couple of people.

31
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:30,140
And, uh, they will get interviewed.

32
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,500
And, then we'll roll into the Q&A.

33
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:34,500
Okay?

34
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:36,920
Alright.

35
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:37,600
Okay.

36
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:40,000
Um, I don't know.

37
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:40,960
Are we ready to go?

38
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:42,740
No?

39
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:45,600
I see some cross arms.

40
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:47,040
So now I gotta kill some time up here.

41
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:48,200
Hmm, what am I gonna do?

42
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:48,840
How am I gonna do?

43
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:49,800
We got two light sticks.

44
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:50,480
Yes.

45
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:51,000
Excellent.

46
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:52,260
Oh!

47
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,420
There's so many.

48
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:54,540
Why did I not notice them?

49
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:57,520
Sure, yeah.

50
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:00,480
Give me a light stick.

51
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:00,500
Give me a light stick.

52
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:01,900
Woo, yay!

53
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:04,000
It's like a mini lightsaber.

54
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,380
Oh, this is too much power.

55
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,600
I should not have this much power in the morning.

56
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:09,340
Oh, my God.

57
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:11,060
Okay.

58
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,680
Well, I think we, uh...

59
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,140
Oh, it got real quiet real fast.

60
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:15,160
Oh, my gosh.

61
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:16,040
Oh, wow.

62
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,640
Oh, people are waving with their lights.

63
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:18,120
Yay!

64
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:18,560
Yay!

65
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,420
So, uh, who was here for the event?

66
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:24,720
Yesterday.

67
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:30,820
Is there anybody who's a first time attendee for AR this year?

68
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:31,360
In here?

69
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:31,920
Oh!

70
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:32,880
Oh, wow.

71
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:33,580
There's a lot of you.

72
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:34,800
Welcome.

73
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:35,820
Good morning.

74
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:36,160
Welcome.

75
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,940
Oh, by the way, my name's McKee.

76
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:39,120
Hello.

77
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:40,180
Hello, new people.

78
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:40,740
Yes.

79
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:43,620
Oh, thank you, Shark Man.

80
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:45,320
I remember you from yesterday.

81
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:46,880
So much hype.

82
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:49,860
Oh, you did!

83
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,840
Oh, you got the water bottle!

84
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:52,260
Yes!

85
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:53,020
Yes!

86
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:56,820
Uh, by the way, uh, she is better than all of you at Rock, Paper, Scissors.

87
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:01,680
So, I mean, it's just, it's, it's a fact now.

88
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:02,900
The water bottle proves it.

89
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:05,220
I'm just saying.

90
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,020
Well, man, we got a lot of seats over here.

91
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,760
I see a couple people sitting in the far back.

92
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,300
There's so many seats over here.

93
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:13,560
You guys wanna come?

94
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,400
Bring your friends, you know?

95
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,000
I'm just saying.

96
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:16,820
There's a lot of seats.

97
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:18,740
There's a lot of seats.

98
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:19,940
Where'd you get the other light stick?

99
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:20,660
There's a lot of seats.

100
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:22,860
I have your light stick.

101
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:29,380
I only got two hands and I got a microphone.

102
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,140
Well, how?

103
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,420
I'm already dual wielding.

104
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:35,840
Oh, I can't do that.

105
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,360
How did you get another light stick?

106
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,700
How many do you have in that bag?

107
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:39,760
Be honest.

108
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,440
It's like a double Darth Maul over here.

109
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,000
You got three?

110
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:48,380
One hand?

111
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:51,360
Okay.

112
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:53,360
Okay, let's do that.

113
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,360
Oh my gosh.

114
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:57,440
Okay, well, let's get started over here.

115
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:03,740
I have the distinct privilege of obviously welcoming our special guest.

116
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,380
Like I said, a thief.

117
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,320
And I learned this morning she's also secretly a tomato.

118
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:09,160
Don't tell anybody.

119
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,480
I've been told not to tell anyone.

120
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:13,400
So you are all in it with me, okay?

121
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,020
Again, ground rules apply.

122
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,220
You're allowed to record.

123
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,080
You're allowed to take photos.

124
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:20,400
Just don't bother anybody else.

125
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:23,660
So without further ado, help me welcome...

126
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:24,600
Doki Man!

127
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:34,750
Apparently I have a talk show right now.

128
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:37,830
So as we all know in talk shows, I have to dance.

129
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:39,670
So like, I guess this is me dancing.

130
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:45,510
And because it's a talk show, look under your seats!

131
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:46,990
Because...

132
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:47,850
There's nothing.

133
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:50,470
So...

134
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:56,070
I can't believe someone has actually looked under your seats.

135
00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:00,410
Oh my gosh!

136
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:00,530
Oh my gosh!

137
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:06,250
You guys have been sitting here for like 15 minutes and you really think there's something under your seats now?

138
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:07,750
Like...

139
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:10,390
Oh my gosh!

140
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:12,950
I'm so excited to be here on the second day!

141
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:14,770
I'm very tired.

142
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:18,490
I had to wake up at 7.30 a.m.

143
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:22,510
I usually don't wake up this early in the morning.

144
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:24,950
So I'm just like...

145
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:25,990
Oh my god!

146
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:29,390
I was like 30 minutes late to the tech rehearsal too.

147
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:30,970
Like yeah, oh my gosh!

148
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:32,170
She has such an ego.

149
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:34,090
She's already late to like rehearsals.

150
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:39,010
Guys, my old PC setup is literally at my old place.

151
00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:39,870
And like...

152
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:43,050
I have a very long commute to get there!

153
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:44,250
I was like...

154
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:45,410
I was like...

155
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:45,770
Oh my...

156
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:46,250
I was like...

157
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:46,670
Oh...

158
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:49,090
But Jokey, you make so much money now!

159
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:50,570
Why don't you just take Uber?

160
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:53,310
Because I literally just moved!

161
00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:56,910
It's so expensive!

162
00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:02,170
I'm not gonna fucking give Uber more of my money!

163
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:03,470
Like...

164
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:06,750
They're hurting me too much getting my Uber Eats money!

165
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:08,930
They don't need to get my Uber car money!

166
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:09,370
I do too!

167
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:10,750
Oh!

168
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:12,250
But yeah!

169
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:14,330
I'm really happy to be here!

170
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:17,270
The EMI talk show!

171
00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:18,150
And like...

172
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:20,090
As like all talk shows have...

173
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:21,100
We have a little...

174
00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:24,150
A little talk show set!

175
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:29,810
A little talk show set!

176
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:30,710
Where's my table?

177
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:32,530
Sorry, I'm very professional.

178
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:33,150
Where's my...

179
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:33,650
Here we go.

180
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:34,670
Here's my table.

181
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:36,050
Let me move over here.

182
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:36,770
Alright!

183
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:42,370
Since this is a talk show, I'm gonna be interviewing a special guest today.

184
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,390
And that special guest...

185
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:46,050
It is...

186
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:46,650
You guys!

187
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:50,970
I'm gonna interview...

188
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:53,290

00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:29,330
You're waving quite vigorously.

206
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:29,830
You don't wanna...

207
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:31,790
Step up, step up!

Oh, good answer!

00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:23,640
Good answer!

270
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:26,720
As my first guest, that has been the best answer of today!

271
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:26,940
Bye!

272
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:30,640

Everything?

278
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:38,640
Gotta be specific!

279
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:40,120
What exactly?

280
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:42,120
What makes Doki Bird so special?

281
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:44,560
Doki Bird.

282
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,060
Alright, get this person out of here.

00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:57,380
I got this.

294
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,180
Someone's chair-ass answer you can give me.

295
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:00,840
Who's, uh...

296
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:01,840
Who's, uh...

297
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:02,580
What is this?

298
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,420
What are you looking at?

299
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:04,540
Are you showing me a receipt?

300
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:05,260
That's too bad.

301
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,460
Showing me a merch receipt?

302
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:10,280
That's a good...

303
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,680
Come up with Mr. Sam.

304
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:12,080
You know what?

305
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:13,940
Alright, alright.

306
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:15,900
Whoever that person is.

307
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:20,040
Here we go, here we go.

308
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:20,480
Alright.

309
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,800
Alright, alright, alright.

00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,440
Where is he?

311
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:24,900
Where is he?

312
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:25,660
Oh, there he is.

313
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:28,420
Oh, that microphone is a little bit too tall for you.

314
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:30,860
I got it, I got it.

315
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:33,280
Don't worry, alright.

316
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:35,720
We're gonna moralize that forever, I guess.

317
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,500
Alright, hello!

318
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:42,400

323
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,040

338
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:17,190

00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:19,410
Keep going?

341
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:23,350
Is that really all you can say?

342
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:23,390
Oh, wait.

343
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:24,550

00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:30,410
That's really it?

349
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:30,690
I...

350
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:32,770
This should be going on for like another five minutes!

351
00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:33,630
Is that really it?

352
00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:34,590
Please!

353
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:39,170
Okay, what?

354
00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:39,610
Okay, alright.

355
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:40,670
I'll give you another chance.

356
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:43,390
As my first guest, I'm gonna give you another chance.

357
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:45,710
Alright, so...

358
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:48,290
What is your favorite moment from Doki Bird?

359
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:50,290
Uh...

360
00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:50,770
The debut.

361
00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:52,370
The debut?

362
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:53,130
The debut?

363
00:21:53,130 --> 00:21:53,310
Yeah!

364
00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:55,070
What is your favorite part of the debut?

365
00:21:55,550 --> 00:21:57,790
I would say the...

366
00:21:58,350 --> 00:21:58,750
Um...

367
00:21:58,750 --> 00:21:59,290

Move it!

371
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:02,450
Move it!

372
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:04,290
I wonder you're a Doki.

373
00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:05,410
Get out of here.

374
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:06,650
It's already so massive.

375
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:08,590
Alright, where am I going here?

376
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:09,290
Where am I going here?

377
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:09,450
Where am I going here?

378
00:22:09,650 --> 00:22:11,010
There is no hesitation.

379
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:12,290
Pika Doki!

380
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:14,070
I saw some Doki's here!

381
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:14,810
Pika...

382
00:22:14,810 --> 00:22:17,190
Only a Doki can ask your Doki question.

383
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:18,530
You know what?

384
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:19,750
There's one right here in the front.

385
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:23,630
There's another big one right here in the front.

386
00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:25,410
Come on up, bud.

387
00:22:26,090 --> 00:22:27,450
Oh my god, is that...

388
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:28,350
Isn't that a Doki?

389
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:29,850
Alright, give me a sec.

390
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:32,210
Oh my god, hello Doki.

391
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:34,430
It's great to see you again, Doki.

392
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:36,170
Yeah, it's great to see you again, Doki.

393
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:36,930
Alright, only...

394
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:37,330
You know what?

395
00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:40,570
Only a Doki can answer some Doki questions.

396
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:41,630
Alright.

397
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:42,670
Okay.

398
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:46,270
As a fellow Doki, who's your favorite Doki?

399
00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:48,050
Favorite Doki?

400
00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:48,850
Favorite Doki?

401
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:49,310
Is Doki.

402
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:51,390
Your favorite Doki bird is Doki?

403
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:51,730
Yeah.

404
00:22:51,810 --> 00:22:52,730
What do you mean by that?

405
00:22:53,290 --> 00:22:55,350
There's so many Doki's in the Doki-verse.

406
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:56,610
What do you mean by Doki?

407
00:22:57,550 --> 00:22:59,990
I think the only correct Doki is Dad.

408
00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:05,270
Oh my god.

409
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:05,750
Okay.

410
00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:07,650
Alright.

411
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:10,230
You've been kicked out of the Doki-verse.

412
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:12,230
I'm sorry, we do not own you anymore.

413
00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:13,150
Valid.

414
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:15,530
I stand by my answer.

415
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:18,450
We do not own this Doki anymore.

416
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:21,410
This Doki has been banished from the Doki-verse.

417
00:23:21,410 --> 00:23:22,950
I'm just saying in a good flow.

418
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:24,510
Okay, here we go.

419
00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:25,270
Pick another Doki.

420
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:25,970
Clearly.

421
00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:27,230
There's a lot over here.

422
00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:28,470
There's so many over here.

423
00:23:28,930 --> 00:23:29,710
Okay, come on up.

424
00:23:29,810 --> 00:23:30,370
Right here, right here.

425
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:30,850
Yes, you.

426
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:31,710
Come on up.

427
00:23:32,330 --> 00:23:36,920
That's my first and last Doki guest here.

428
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:40,320
Clearly, you have all failed me.

429
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:44,480
Don't worry, don't worry.

430
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:45,160
It's redemption time.

431
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:45,720
No pressure.

432
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:53,000
I don't know where you're getting all these Doki's, but clearly, there's a reason why I'm here as a guest and you're not Doki.

433
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:58,560
Alright, hello Doki.

434
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:01,680
Hello.

435
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:05,520
Alright, Doki.

436
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:09,880
Well, as my first guest, who's your favorite Doki?

437
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:12,420
Doki Bird.

438
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:13,120
Doki Bird.

439
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,560
Oh, Doki Bird.

440
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:17,360
But specifically which Doki Bird from the Doki-verse?

441
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:18,700
The Kroki.

442
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:19,420
The tomato.

443
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:38,820
Sorry, the show has been canceled.

444
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:50,540
We have decided to cancel the Doki Bird talk show because of creative differences with the team.

445
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:59,160
Now, sadly, sadly, Doki Bird talk show has been canceled now.

446
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:00,000
Oh.

447
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:06,620
This has now been rebranded as the Doki Bird Q&A.

448
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:10,320
Wow, guys.

449
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:15,260
You guys just wasted $5 million of budget on the Doki Bird talk show.

450
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:23,140
We were going to have musical guests from like, I don't know, Pitbull was going to show up and do his thing.

451
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:24,800
I can't believe it.

452
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,180
You guys got it canceled.

453
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:28,600
We could have had it all, Jack.

454
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,300
We could have had it all, Dragoo.

455
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:34,720
Remember, it was your fault.

456
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:45,940
Well then, since the Doki Bird talk show has been canceled, I guess I'll take a Q&A now.

457
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:52,220
The budget has lessened to like $5, so now it's Q&A time.

458
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,000
Okay.

459
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:57,340
I think it's my time again.

460
00:25:57,460 --> 00:26:00,760
I get to pick somebody to come up, right?

461
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

462
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,880
You get to pick somebody to come up.

463
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:04,920
Oh, you can, you can come up.

464
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,740
Yes, there we go.

465
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,100
Oh, no.

466
00:26:17,370 --> 00:26:18,230
Alright, so Doki.

467
00:26:19,090 --> 00:26:19,310
Yeah?

468
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:20,350
Are you and Peter still together?

469
00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:27,830
Bro, the poor man.

470
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:35,590
Honestly, I'm so surprised that shit went viral.

471
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:39,270
And then, it's like, what do you do when you go viral?

472
00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:40,050
Like, I don't know.

473
00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:42,930
I was like, I have a convention to do.

474
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:44,810
I can't be doing anything.

475
00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:50,010
You know, that video has like, 6 million views now?

476
00:26:50,370 --> 00:26:51,170
6.4.

477
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:53,010
6.4?

478
00:26:53,390 --> 00:26:54,370
That poor man.

479
00:26:54,370 --> 00:27:01,950
It, like, got so big that I heard that people were posting it on Facebook.

480
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:05,470
That's when you know he's fucked because he's posting it on Facebook.

481
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:07,330
You can't even see the GIF.

482
00:27:08,610 --> 00:27:15,290
Like, you can even find the GIF of my reaction on Twitter GIFs, which is really crazy to think about.

483
00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:19,410
And then, like, it got translated in so many different languages.

484
00:27:19,410 --> 00:27:25,550
So, like, people in different countries know about this poor man getting fumbling.

485
00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:28,710
Like, not even to 3K people now.

486
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:30,590
It's to, like, millions of people.

487
00:27:31,290 --> 00:27:33,190
But to be fair, like, why don't...

488
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:35,130
Console has voice chat.

489
00:27:35,330 --> 00:27:36,030
Has Discord.

490
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:39,710
Why would you say this randomly in a public voice chat?

491
00:27:39,810 --> 00:27:40,830
I still don't understand.

492
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:45,930
I just...

493
00:27:47,890 --> 00:27:50,930
If he had to get it out in an Apex play...

494
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:58,350
Apex up, like, quick play match, then he never had a chance in the first place.

495
00:28:00,570 --> 00:28:01,890
He's already suffering enough.

496
00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:02,790
You don't have to do that to him.

497
00:28:03,970 --> 00:28:06,790
I mean, we all feel bad for that guy.

498
00:28:08,290 --> 00:28:09,730
Oh, my God.

499
00:28:10,330 --> 00:28:10,930
Oh, my God.

500
00:28:10,930 --> 00:28:11,950
That poor guy.

501
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:14,950
I hope he one day finds his Apex e-girl.

502
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:16,610
Oh, my God.

503
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:18,150
I hope he finds one.

504
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:19,990
I hope one day.

505
00:28:20,150 --> 00:28:21,390
You know, after, like...

506
00:28:21,390 --> 00:28:24,370
After what happened to him, like...

507
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:25,690
It's important character development.

508
00:28:26,090 --> 00:28:26,950
That's true.

509
00:28:27,490 --> 00:28:28,210
I mean, like...

510
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:30,770
Like, the fact that, like, he...

511
00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:37,210
That team coincidentally cued into me and not knowing that I'm a streamer.

512
00:28:37,690 --> 00:28:40,070
And then end up saying all of that stuff.

513
00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:41,310
Being like, oh...

514
00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:42,690
At least, like...

515
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:44,330
At least the only fumble...

516
00:28:44,330 --> 00:28:45,090
I saw...

517
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:49,190
The only person that saw that fumble was this random person on our team.

518
00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:51,930
Not knowing that she's a streamer.

519
00:28:52,570 --> 00:28:53,490
Oh, man.

520
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:55,490
He doesn't know.

521
00:28:56,970 --> 00:28:58,690
I hope he never knows.

522
00:28:59,610 --> 00:29:01,050
He's gonna fight eventually.

523
00:29:03,130 --> 00:29:04,070
Who knows?

524
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:04,950
Who knows?

525
00:29:05,290 --> 00:29:06,670
I will be very surprised...

526
00:29:07,130 --> 00:29:08,110
Well, actually, no, no.

527
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:08,730
I...

528
00:29:08,730 --> 00:29:11,410
I'm just surprised that no one has...

529
00:29:11,410 --> 00:29:15,390
Like, none of those people have acknowledged the clip yet.

530
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:19,590
Like, I don't think I've seen, like, the actual people in that...

531
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:21,970
in that clip acknowledging that it's them.

532
00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:22,450
So, like...

533
00:29:22,450 --> 00:29:23,850
Well, two members are console players.

534
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:25,310
I don't think they even have social media.

535
00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:26,110
Oh!

536
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:33,050
I didn't say that.

537
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:35,490
You were thinking it.

538
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:36,310
Those were...

539
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:39,090
Those are supposed to be your inside thoughts.

540
00:29:43,410 --> 00:29:45,090
This is why...

541
00:29:45,090 --> 00:29:49,730
I'm a streamer, because I keep my inside thoughts to myself.

542
00:29:52,550 --> 00:29:53,210
Alright.

543
00:29:53,550 --> 00:29:54,620
That's a good question.

544
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:56,260
That's a good question.

545
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:56,400
That's a good question.

546
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:57,480
I hope that...

547
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,060
I hope that...

548
00:29:59,060 --> 00:29:59,440
I hope that...

549
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,440
One day...

550
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:05,300
I hope that Saul one day finds his dream girl.

551
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:07,400
That's not taken by Petey.

552
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:11,200
Well, speaking of finding...

553
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,200
I gotta find somebody else.

554
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:13,240
Let's see.

555
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:13,900
Let's see.

556
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:14,660
Where am I going?

557
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:15,460
Where am I going?

558
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:16,440
I don't know.

559
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,440
I feel like I got a piece of love back here.

560
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:19,140
But I don't know.

561
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,180
They don't seem very exciting.

562
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:21,300
So, maybe I'll hook over here.

563
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:23,500
Oh, that's...

564
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:24,100
Oh, wow.

565
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:24,340
Okay.

566
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:25,720
Do you have a stop sign?

567
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:27,640
What the hell?

568
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:29,020
I don't know.

569
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:29,880
That's a stop sign.

570
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:30,420
Where did you get...

571
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:31,500
Where did you get that from?

572
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,100
That was my question.

573
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:33,140
Okay.

574
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:33,700
Let's see.

575
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:34,100
Let's see.

576
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,220
Where am I looking here?

577
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:35,980
Where am I looking here?

578
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,640
Oh, there's a lot of hype over here.

579
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:38,100
Sure.

580
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:38,380
Okay.

581
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,220
Come on up.

582
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:39,860
Yeah!

583
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:42,000
Wow!

584
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,020
He's, uh...

585
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:43,580
He's, uh...

586
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:44,020
He's ready.

587
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:44,800
Come on up.

588
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:45,420
Come on up.

589
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:46,220
Look at you.

590
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:47,160
Look at you.

591
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:48,520
He had the whole...

592
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:50,160
Whole section going for him.

593
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:53,240
Oh, then it might be a really good question.

594
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:55,180
Or a really, really dumb question.

595
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:55,460
Really bad question.

596
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,760
It could be a really bad question.

597
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:01,680
What is that?

598
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:03,040
Is that Nutella?

599
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,100
We're not doing it.

600
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:06,760
Is that ketchup?

601
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:09,480
What is that?

602
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:10,240
It's ketchup.

603
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:11,540
Oh, I...

604
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:12,340
Okay.

605
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:14,240
What are you gonna do with this ketchup bottle?

606
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:16,260
When are we getting renamed to Nesticles?

607
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:19,160
If not, I'm burning you into ketchup.

608
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:21,060
This will be you.

609
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:25,200
This was a threat?

610
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:26,880
This was a picture, though.

611
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:32,940
That's crazy.

612
00:31:35,010 --> 00:31:36,690
Did you just eat ketchup when I turned around?

613
00:31:36,690 --> 00:31:37,390
Keep

614
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:44,360
doing it.

615
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:44,760
Keep doing it.

616
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:45,160
Come on.

617
00:31:56,090 --> 00:31:56,570
Hold this.

618
00:31:56,890 --> 00:31:57,290
Keep doing it.

619
00:31:58,310 --> 00:31:59,850
Guys, are we bad people?

620
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:07,110
Oh, shit.

621
00:32:07,170 --> 00:32:08,030
That's half the bottle.

622
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:10,510
Oh, my God.

623
00:32:14,530 --> 00:32:16,750
Alright, now you can go sit back in your chair now.

624
00:32:17,210 --> 00:32:18,130
I don't want an answer.

625
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:18,850
That's too bad.

626
00:32:18,850 --> 00:32:19,290
I don't want an answer.

627
00:32:19,650 --> 00:32:20,530
It's a threat.

628
00:32:21,030 --> 00:32:22,010
This was...

629
00:32:22,010 --> 00:32:22,550
Where am I going?

630
00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:22,850
Alright?

631
00:32:23,510 --> 00:32:26,810
That was a nice public humiliation drag game.

632
00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:29,630
I'm glad we all have thought the same thing together.

633
00:32:30,830 --> 00:32:31,710
What is it?

634
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:35,690
It's a toe kick in the head of the flag.

635
00:32:37,410 --> 00:32:40,690
Guys, I got Tim Hortons ice caps today.

636
00:32:40,690 --> 00:32:41,810
But like...

637
00:32:43,510 --> 00:32:46,590
Okay, we shouldn't cheer for that because it's Tim Hortons.

638
00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:52,830
We all know their coffee is not the best.

639
00:32:55,770 --> 00:32:58,530
I don't know why you cheer for Tim Hortons.

640
00:32:59,670 --> 00:33:00,790
It wasn't working.

641
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:03,010
Now I gotta pick somebody else here.

642
00:33:03,210 --> 00:33:03,330
Okay?

643
00:33:03,430 --> 00:33:05,230
Someone who's not gonna threaten anybody.

644
00:33:05,990 --> 00:33:07,290
Oh, my gosh.

645
00:33:08,050 --> 00:33:08,990
You got a shirt on?

646
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:09,610
Get over here.

647
00:33:09,930 --> 00:33:10,850
Get over here.

648
00:33:10,930 --> 00:33:11,530
Get over here.

649
00:33:11,650 --> 00:33:12,130
No threats.

650
00:33:12,150 --> 00:33:12,870
Is that the requirement?

651
00:33:13,170 --> 00:33:14,370
You got a shirt on?

652
00:33:14,610 --> 00:33:16,510
Like, I hope that everybody has a shirt on.

653
00:33:16,510 --> 00:33:16,950
Hey, listen.

654
00:33:17,090 --> 00:33:18,690
Alright, not all this is even high standards.

655
00:33:18,890 --> 00:33:18,990
Alright?

656
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:19,570
That's all I'm saying.

657
00:33:20,370 --> 00:33:23,310
I hope everybody has a shirt on.

658
00:33:23,490 --> 00:33:24,550
Don't free the nipple.

659
00:33:29,410 --> 00:33:31,030
Sorry, I'm just a bit nervous.

660
00:33:32,530 --> 00:33:33,410
Don't worry, man.

661
00:33:33,550 --> 00:33:34,490
You have a shirt on.

662
00:33:34,670 --> 00:33:35,130
That's okay.

663
00:33:37,530 --> 00:33:38,210
Thank you.

664
00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:41,990
Not really a question, but like...

665
00:33:42,510 --> 00:33:43,950
So I've...

666
00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:44,690
Shit.

667
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:47,430
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

668
00:33:47,530 --> 00:33:48,290
Don't smirk on the mic.

669
00:33:48,650 --> 00:33:50,590
We're all up to you, but no question.

670
00:33:50,630 --> 00:33:54,230
Okay, so last year there was a VTuber who came to Vancouver.

671
00:33:54,230 --> 00:33:59,550
And, um, so you might know, like, there's, there's a tradition, right?

672
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:03,230
We just grab some onion rings and...

673
00:34:08,330 --> 00:34:09,250
What's the question?

674
00:34:09,290 --> 00:34:09,310
What's the question?

675
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:10,570
Oh!

676
00:34:11,010 --> 00:34:11,530
What?

677
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:14,670
It's not even...

678
00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:16,310
It's not even a question!

679
00:34:16,690 --> 00:34:17,590
I shouldn't, I shouldn't...

680
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:19,350
I shouldn't have picked the guy with the shirt.

681
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:20,350
I know.

682
00:34:20,470 --> 00:34:21,490
Alright, someone...

683
00:34:21,490 --> 00:34:22,010
Okay, hold on.

684
00:34:22,010 --> 00:34:23,410
I don't have the very first...

685
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:28,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

686
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:28,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

687
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:31,340
You should ask them what they want to ask first before you get asked.

688
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:31,980
Yeah, maybe.

689
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:34,020
Maybe, but wait, hold on, what do you want to ask?

690
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:36,120
Don't worry, I'll help you a good job.

691
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,300
Please be a good question.

692
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:41,080
So, the person I'm sitting beside also had this question.

693
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:42,540
English or Spanish?

694
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,120
I ain't afraid.

695
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:51,280
Come on!

696
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:57,780
I have a serious question.

697
00:34:58,300 --> 00:34:58,640
Okay.

698
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:03,140
For people that want to become VTubers, what would your advice be?

699
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:03,980
Finally...

700
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:05,520
Um...

701
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:06,520
Um...

702
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,520
Not be mental...

703
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:08,740
Okay.

704
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:19,200
The joke answer is not be mentally well, but the real...

705
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,620
The real...

706
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:22,180
We're not...

707
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:23,320
Okay.

708
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,280
Right now.

709
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:34,460
But, like, the real answer is, um, if you want to get started as a VTuber, gotta do it as a hobby.

710
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:36,360
Do not go full in.

711
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:47,420
Because, like, obviously, I've said it before, but, like, VTubing to making content creation in general, it's, like, 99% luck, in my opinion.

712
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:51,200
Um, because it's basically, like, you have to get your big break.

713
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:58,240
So, um, and it's very, very hard to make it when the market itself is, like, super saturated.

714
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:01,540
So, you gotta be, like, unique in a way.

715
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:02,900
And you gotta be...

716
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:03,940
Yeah, you can't be...

717
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:06,220
And you can't be an introvert as a content creator.

718
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:07,420
Because...

719
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:11,700
I mean, you can, but it's gonna be a lot harder for you.

720
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:18,320
So, you gotta be very open to be social to people, and, like, open to, like, network and collaborate with others.

721
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:24,320
And, um, I would highly suggest starting out on Twitch, even though I'm a YouTube streamer.

722
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:28,620
Um, because I already have an established fanbase, so it's easier to be on YouTube.

723
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:33,120
And discoverability for streaming is very easy on Twitch.

724
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:38,120
But discoverability on YouTube is not, because where the fuck do I find streams on YouTube?

725
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:39,000
Like, you know what?

726
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:39,880
You have to...

727
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:42,420
I just, like, how do I find new people on YouTube?

728
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:43,300
It's so difficult.

729
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:50,800
Um, but I would suggest, like, um, abusing shorts on YouTube, or short-form content.

730
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:54,200
Because, like, TikTok is about to be gone in America.

731
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:55,160
So...

732
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:59,060
TikTok is gonna be banned in the United States of America.

733
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:02,080
Uh, because, oh, they're gathering our data.

734
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:02,680
But who...

735
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:05,340
But everybody's gathering our data, so who cares?

736
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:12,180
Anyway, uh, because of that, YouTube's like, ooh, TikTok's gonna be gone.

737
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:14,080
I'm gonna be the next TikTok.

738
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:15,360
So they're hard...

739
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:18,280
They're heavy pushing short-form content now.

740
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:21,820
That's why everybody is spamming shorts and, like, short streams.

741
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:31,460
So, like, I would highly suggest just spamming shorts and stuff from your streams on YouTube, and putting, like, highlights and stuff on YouTube, but then fully streaming on Twitch.

742
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:38,440
But yes, do it as a hobby, and then when it starts being more sustainable, you can look into doing it as, like, a full-time thing.

743
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:39,920
Like, even a lot of...

744
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:49,660
Even a lot of, like, um, big streamers, they don't quit their job, like, their main job, until, like, they know it's, like, said, said type film.

745
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:55,900
So, because I know some YouTubers that actually still have, like, a second job.

746
00:37:56,220 --> 00:38:04,500
So, like, uh, because this is, like, the hobby of theirs, or, like, it's not, like, something that they think they could do for a long time, because they're not fully sure yet.

747
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:09,660
So, yeah, just do it as a hobby first, and then when you think it's a sure-sure deal, then full-time.

748
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:12,460
Because this is, for me, I don't have a second job.

749
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:14,920
So I'm fucked if something happens to me.

750
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:21,760
But that's okay.

751
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:24,740
Don't do what I do, son.

752
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:30,720
Yeah, that's an actual good question!

753
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:31,620
Thank you so much.

754
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:33,800
I wish you were the first person I asked.

755
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:36,060
Everyone buy her membership.

756
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:37,380
Yes.

757
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:39,360
Buy my merch, too.

758
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,100
All right.

759
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:44,140
Okay, first, first, first thing this person said is I have a good question.

760
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:45,300
I swear to God.

761
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:46,840
I swear to God.

762
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:47,680
Get up there.

763
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:50,200
You know, like, one out of ten?

764
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:52,480
That's not very good statistically-wise.

765
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:56,620
I'm redoing that one.

766
00:38:58,880 --> 00:38:59,880
Oh, hold on.

767
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:00,320
Still.

768
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:01,040
Oh, no, no, no.

769
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:02,620
Okay, who's got a good question?

770
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:03,520
Who's got a good question?

771
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:06,000
Okay, hold on.

772
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:06,920
Let me, let me check.

773
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:08,980
Yeah, there's so much pressure on you.

774
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:09,100
I don't know.

775
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:11,000
But is that one good question?

776
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:11,980
Could be a fluke.

777
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:16,000
This is a good question.

778
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:17,680
All right, all right.

779
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:18,860
This is actually a good question.

780
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:20,240
How good is it?

781
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:21,200
Let's see.

782
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:21,940
I don't know.

783
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:23,340
No pressure or anything.

784
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:28,880
I mean, to be fair, there were a lot of bad questions before you, so, like, you literally could not do worse.

785
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:33,400
I know I'm good because you told us to ask this.

786
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:34,880
Okay.

787
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:35,060
Yes.

788
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:39,880
So I hear that there are a couple of con-exclusive FOMO stories that you have heard.

789
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:40,400
Oh!

790
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,120
The FOMO story.

791
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:56,680
I know, like, there's actually some Dragoons that have went to every convention, or, like, almost every convention that have heard you sending the story over and over, because they thought, I think they, I think some of them thought that, like, that story would be different every convention,

792
00:39:56,820 --> 00:39:58,100
but it's the same story.

793
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:08,380
So I'm very sorry to some of my Dragoons that have actually thought I'm gonna be, like, giving different stories every convention.

794
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,260
But I appreciate it.

795
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:13,580
I appreciate you guys coming here.

796
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:15,400
Alright.

797
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:27,300
So the reason why I don't tell this story on YouTube or on stream, like, it doesn't matter if it's on Twitch or anything, is that I'm very worried, I'm gonna say a word in the story, and then YouTube or Twitch is gonna flag it.

798
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:35,760
So, basically, a long time ago, a very dark past of mine.

799
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:40,400
I used to be a fan of Italia.

800
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:43,740
It was a very dark time.

801
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:47,960
It was an incredibly dark time of mine.

802
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:52,640
Because I wasn't into Italia because I loved history.

803
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:55,380
There was another reason why people liked Italia.

804
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:12,340
Those who don't know what Italia is, it's like the personification of countries as pretty boys, and sometimes pretty girls, but mostly pretty handsome boys.

805
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:22,100
So, my favorite character was Prussia.

806
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:26,460
And I just really liked his personality.

807
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:29,880
And also, like, other stuff.

808
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:35,100
But, like, the other stuff as in, like, I really liked it when he shipped with, like, you know, other countries.

809
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:37,720
I told you, it was a very dark time.

810
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:43,080
It was a very, very dark time.

811
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:54,240
So, because my favorite character was Prussia, oh my god, I just realized his mascot was a bird, too.

812
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:55,760
Oh my god, it's a full circle.

813
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:59,420
I just realized it's a yellow bird.

814
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:00,600
Okay, anyway.

815
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:12,600
One day, on Halloween, I decided to cosplay Prussia on Halloween at my school.

816
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:15,500
And so, like, I had everything.

817
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:18,900
Like, the wig, the outfit, the whole entire cosplay.

818
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:23,080
Including the Iron Cross.

819
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:32,680
So, because it was very accurate.

820
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:40,040
So, I went to school as the Prussia cosplay.

821
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:45,700
And then a teacher dragged me to the corner when they saw my outfit.

822
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:49,580
And was like, are you a Nazi?

823
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:56,780
And I was like, no.

824
00:42:57,060 --> 00:43:01,770
I was playing as an anime character.

825
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:06,510
It's Prussia from Italia.

826
00:43:07,130 --> 00:43:09,190
And obviously, it's some old guy.

827
00:43:09,510 --> 00:43:11,410
Old guy who's a math teacher.

828
00:43:11,410 --> 00:43:13,830
He doesn't know what the fuck is Prussia.

829
00:43:14,250 --> 00:43:15,770
I mean, he knows what Prussia is.

830
00:43:15,870 --> 00:43:17,110
But he's like, what the fuck?

831
00:43:17,310 --> 00:43:18,330
You're a person.

832
00:43:18,690 --> 00:43:21,030
Like, he doesn't know.

833
00:43:21,170 --> 00:43:21,670
Italia?

834
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:26,610
So, I got in a little trouble.

835
00:43:27,430 --> 00:43:30,190
Because, yeah, people thought I was a Nazi.

836
00:43:30,810 --> 00:43:33,230
So, it was really bad.

837
00:43:34,050 --> 00:43:37,310
And that's why I don't tell this story on stream.

838
00:43:37,630 --> 00:43:43,150
Because I'm worried if I say Nazi, YouTube's gonna be like, what the fuck, she's a Nazi.

839
00:43:43,150 --> 00:43:45,450
And I'm like, I don't want that to happen.

840
00:43:47,310 --> 00:43:52,610
Also, people might clip me on a contest and be like, Toki cosplayed as Prussia?

841
00:43:53,230 --> 00:43:54,450
Oh my god.

842
00:43:55,750 --> 00:43:56,750
She's a Nazi.

843
00:43:56,770 --> 00:43:58,330
I don't want it to get clipped like that.

844
00:43:59,250 --> 00:43:59,730
So...

845
00:44:02,050 --> 00:44:04,610
This is why this is only exclusive to conventions.

846
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:15,360
If it makes you feel any better, there was a kid at my school who actually dressed as a Nazi for Halloween.

847
00:44:16,460 --> 00:44:16,860
Ohhhh!

848
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:30,200
I don't even know what to say.

849
00:44:30,540 --> 00:44:32,580
Because I have no excuse.

850
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:33,220
It was...

851
00:44:40,340 --> 00:44:41,420
Is that...

852
00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:42,640
Ice caps?

853
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:44,060
Nice.

854
00:44:44,260 --> 00:44:45,400
Yeah, it's a good ice cap.

855
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:47,300
Literally the only good thing they make.

856
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:54,220
Wait, I...

857
00:44:54,220 --> 00:44:54,740
No questions.

858
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:55,640
No questions.

859
00:44:57,220 --> 00:45:02,200
The only bad question and you rejected it.

860
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:04,000
I didn't reject it.

861
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:05,140
They rejected it.

862
00:45:08,620 --> 00:45:10,220
Okay, okay, hold on, hold on, hold on.

863
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:10,600
Let me see.

864
00:45:11,660 --> 00:45:13,440
Who do you think has a good question?

865
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:14,760
I don't know.

866
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:15,700
Alright, that guy...

867
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:19,040
That guy that's waving his sticks like it's on fire.

868
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:19,720
Which one?

869
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:20,340
Which one?

870
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:21,740
There's so many over here.

871
00:45:21,820 --> 00:45:22,520
There's multiple?

872
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:25,040
That one guy that I see on the camera.

873
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:25,940
Yeah, yeah, that guy.

874
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:27,420
Okay, alright, come up here.

875
00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:29,040
Let me hear your question real quick.

876
00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:32,060
Alright, if it's a really bad question, just let him say it.

877
00:45:32,060 --> 00:45:35,880
But if it's a really, really bad question, don't let him say it.

878
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:37,440
I'll trust your judgment.

879
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:39,740
First mistake.

880
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:44,600
He doesn't have a question for it, he was just excited.

881
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:55,120
I'm gonna wave my sticks, it's not like he's gonna pick me or anything.

882
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:57,680
You'll take the bullet?

883
00:46:01,020 --> 00:46:02,220
Alright, that's a good question.

884
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:02,940
That's a good question.

885
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:03,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

886
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:04,360
Okay.

887
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:05,560
Yeah.

888
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:07,120
Welcome, welcome up to this person.

889
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:07,600
Hey!

890
00:46:14,370 --> 00:46:16,150
Slowly making his way over the bike.

891
00:46:16,390 --> 00:46:17,370
I'm not gonna run.

892
00:46:20,690 --> 00:46:21,410
What's good?

893
00:46:22,190 --> 00:46:22,790
I'm good?

894
00:46:23,070 --> 00:46:23,870
Is that your question?

895
00:46:24,410 --> 00:46:27,190
No, that's... that's a statement, but...

896
00:46:28,430 --> 00:46:30,450
What made you fall in love with MeTuber?

897
00:46:32,950 --> 00:46:34,890
Oh... that is a good question.

898
00:46:35,890 --> 00:46:37,510
Okay, I won't say in love.

899
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:57,040
Okay, um, I think it's mostly because, like, you know, with a skin suit, like, you know, you can just put it on and then just, like, I can get up and put on my skin suit and then go live and all that stuff.

900
00:46:57,180 --> 00:46:58,460
So, like, that's the best part.

901
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:03,020
Like, um, you don't need to prep for anything or any way.

902
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:04,680
You just wake up.

903
00:47:05,140 --> 00:47:05,900
It's stream time.

904
00:47:08,740 --> 00:47:16,120
And, like, also, like, um, because, like, before then, before then, I didn't stream with, like, anything.

905
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:17,640
It was just gameplay-wise.

906
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:22,980
So, like, when VT being first, like, became a thing, I was, like, really interested in it.

907
00:47:23,060 --> 00:47:28,660
And this was before, I talked about this before, but, like, this was before Hollow EN even debuted.

908
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:32,240
So, like, it was, like, really new in the western side.

909
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:42,560
Um, so, and I don't know if you guys know this, but back in the days, a long time in 2019 to 2020, um, nobody used 2D.

910
00:47:42,940 --> 00:47:45,400
Like, not nobody, but, like, it was so rare.

911
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:51,840
It was, like, 2D was considered the, the, the, um, too expensive.

912
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,740
So, people would be using 3D instead for VTubing.

913
00:47:55,840 --> 00:48:00,760
Like, with Vroid and, uh, and, like, uh, Lupit and all that stuff.

914
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:06,540
And it was, like, 3D was the cheaper alternative, which was crazy to think back then.

915
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:09,600
Because now people are, like, we gotta work hard to get 3D.

916
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:13,040
But back then, it was, like, 3D is the cheapest alternative to 2D.

917
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:21,380
And, um, I remember, like, getting into, like, reading about 3D stuff and thinking about, like, oh, I really love how expressive you can be in 3D.

918
00:48:21,740 --> 00:48:23,660
And, like, talking to your viewers and everything.

919
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:25,480
And I thought it was, like, such a cool idea.

920
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:32,200
And how you could, like, change outfits, like, by changing skin suits and ripping your skin off and then putting on different skin on.

921
00:48:32,580 --> 00:48:34,240
Um, and I thought that was so cool.

922
00:48:34,460 --> 00:48:38,100
And honestly, like, I felt like it was very interactive, too, for fans.

923
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:42,060
And, um, it's also, like, technology, too.

924
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:44,280
So, like, it's a growing market.

925
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:46,960
And it's gonna keep getting better and better and better.

926
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:50,420
But when you're a fleshy, how else can you get better?

927
00:48:50,660 --> 00:48:51,880
You're, you're just flesh.

928
00:48:52,340 --> 00:48:52,780
Like...

929
00:48:54,120 --> 00:49:01,360
Like, oh, they're gonna have, like, a stronger camera for your fleshy self that's gonna see all your pores?

930
00:49:01,420 --> 00:49:02,760
Like, no, fuck that shit.

931
00:49:03,180 --> 00:49:05,980
Like, there's no improvement to flesh.

932
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:06,920
Uh-huh.

933
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:09,380
But there's gonna be improvement to technology.

934
00:49:09,820 --> 00:49:12,220
To, like, um, to, like, V-tubing.

935
00:49:12,420 --> 00:49:18,760
Every, every year there's gonna be some unique thing, unique new meta, unique trend that's gonna be in V-tubing.

936
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:20,900
Cause it's all 2D slash 3D.

937
00:49:21,180 --> 00:49:22,620
While fleshies have nothing.

938
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:24,680
So that's why I like V-tubing.

939
00:49:25,220 --> 00:49:25,580
Don't worry!

940
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:29,500
But, yeah, that's why I fell in love with V-tubing.

941
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:30,940
I love the interactiveness of it.

942
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:33,260
And how expressive you can be.

943
00:49:35,380 --> 00:49:36,140
Thank you.

944
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:37,000
Yeah!

945
00:49:39,260 --> 00:49:40,880
I gotta vet your question first.

946
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:42,320
Hold on.

947
00:49:45,380 --> 00:49:47,020
Hands are shaking and there's a list.

948
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:47,500
Hold on.

949
00:49:48,180 --> 00:49:49,380
There's a list?

950
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:50,300
There's a list.

951
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:51,980
You only get one on the list.

952
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:54,720
You only got one on the list!

953
00:49:56,500 --> 00:49:58,440
Oh, he's like, oh no, what?

954
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:00,140
I thought I could ask 20.

955
00:50:05,620 --> 00:50:08,020
Damn, he's, he's thinking real hard.

956
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:08,700
Alright, okay, alright.

957
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:10,260
One of the, better be that one.

958
00:50:13,700 --> 00:50:15,400
Alright, Mr. Shaky Hands.

959
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:16,860
Hello, it's me again.

960
00:50:17,460 --> 00:50:18,720
Hello, hello!

961
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:25,620
Okay, out of all of your friends, which one would you think would survive on an island?

962
00:50:27,420 --> 00:50:29,220
Bro, all of my friends are V-tubers.

963
00:50:29,380 --> 00:50:30,460
None of them are from this island.

964
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:36,240
Okay, not just V-tubers, but also people, the flesh-shares who are on.

965
00:50:36,420 --> 00:50:40,080
I would say none of them, because they're all terminally online.

966
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:41,560
So like...

967
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:44,160
Like, I know I won't survive.

968
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:51,240
Like, I'm thinking, I was like, do any of them have like, actual survival skills?

969
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:57,000
And I'm like, no, we'd all die, because we have no, like, we have no technology.

970
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:00,160
I guess like...

971
00:51:00,780 --> 00:51:02,820
Not, okay, I'm thinking.

972
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:04,980
No, they'll all die.

973
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:12,240
We're all, we're all, like, content creators.

974
00:51:12,260 --> 00:51:15,340
You think we have skin-up survival skills?

975
00:51:16,020 --> 00:51:16,640
Like...

976
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:17,400
You know what I mean?

977
00:51:19,420 --> 00:51:28,480
Bro, bro, I don't- I haven't- I haven't capped in like, since the- since my horror stories of capping.

978
00:51:29,380 --> 00:51:31,500
And that was so long ago.

979
00:51:31,500 --> 00:51:34,900
That's why I was like, in the- in ninth grade.

980
00:51:38,060 --> 00:51:39,760
But yes, that's my answer.

981
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:41,980
We would all die if we were stranded.

982
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:47,220
So please, please make sure we don't get stranded in this- in an island.

983
00:51:49,060 --> 00:51:50,520
Okay, I gotta go now.

984
00:51:50,620 --> 00:51:52,720
Apparently I can't ask multiple questions.

985
00:51:52,780 --> 00:51:53,820
Only one question.

986
00:51:54,100 --> 00:51:55,140
Only one question.

987
00:51:55,140 --> 00:51:55,480
Only one question.

988
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:55,920
Yes.

989
00:51:56,260 --> 00:51:57,400
Okay, hold on, hold on.

990
00:51:57,400 --> 00:51:58,620
I'll take it here as well.

991
00:51:58,920 --> 00:51:59,920
Start headbanging.

992
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:01,520
Start headbanging.

993
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:02,480
Let me vet your question.

994
00:52:02,580 --> 00:52:02,980
Get over here.

995
00:52:03,700 --> 00:52:04,380
Oh, there's a door.

996
00:52:22,610 --> 00:52:23,230
Alright, okay.

997
00:52:23,450 --> 00:52:23,890
Alright, okay.

998
00:52:24,690 --> 00:52:26,630
I was gonna say, that seems like a long question.

999
00:52:27,750 --> 00:52:29,290
It's actually pretty short, you know.

1000
00:52:29,410 --> 00:52:30,770
I get a little bit of trippy.

1001
00:52:32,210 --> 00:52:32,570
Hi.

1002
00:52:33,230 --> 00:52:33,590
Hello.

1003
00:52:33,590 --> 00:52:36,030
Who is your Oshii?

1004
00:52:36,770 --> 00:52:38,630
Who is my Oshii?

1005
00:52:39,950 --> 00:52:41,130
Who is my Oshii?

1006
00:52:41,490 --> 00:52:42,250
Doki Bird.

1007
00:52:44,550 --> 00:52:51,720
I mean, I literally have a shrine of Doki, so like, who else could it be?

1008
00:52:54,300 --> 00:52:59,200
But if you're asking non-VTubers, then it will be Daft Punk.

1009
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:01,400
I hope Daft Punk...

1010
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:03,860
I'm still so sad that he retired.

1011
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:05,320
I'm still so sad.

1012
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:10,140
Which Doki?

1013
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,760
Which Doki is my favorite?

1014
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,780
The one that's a guest at Annie Revo right now.

1015
00:53:19,580 --> 00:53:24,420
The one that gets all the special privileges compared to the other Doki's.

1016
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:26,880
Alright, I got somebody.

1017
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:28,220
I got somebody with a good question.

1018
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:29,400
Go for it.

1019
00:53:32,910 --> 00:53:33,370
Hello!

1020
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:34,010
Hello!

1021
00:53:35,070 --> 00:53:36,850
Oh my god, he has a shirt on too!

1022
00:53:37,370 --> 00:53:37,630
Yeah!

1023
00:53:39,670 --> 00:53:41,810
They don't wear Doki shirts, they're technically naked.

1024
00:53:44,990 --> 00:53:49,270
Alright, my question is, as a future winner of Twitch Rivals, how did you do it?

1025
00:53:50,030 --> 00:53:52,810
Oh, future winner of Twitch Rivals!

1026
00:53:54,010 --> 00:53:54,530
Wow!

1027
00:53:56,030 --> 00:53:58,950
Wow, you're gonna be so disappointed right here.

1028
00:54:03,130 --> 00:54:04,590
How did I did it?

1029
00:54:04,690 --> 00:54:05,750
How did I do it?

1030
00:54:05,890 --> 00:54:10,350
Well, I will assume, I will assume you were watching the wrong stream.

1031
00:54:10,790 --> 00:54:11,690
That's how I did it.

1032
00:54:12,030 --> 00:54:22,610
As for those who don't know, I have a Twitch stream for Twitch Rivals, that was great, Apex Legends, at like 2 p.m.

1033
00:54:23,090 --> 00:54:25,510
So, like, I don't know, take your phone out and watch it.

1034
00:54:28,650 --> 00:54:33,270
And don't listen to whatever this guy is saying, because, like, there's no way I'm winning that.

1035
00:54:34,550 --> 00:54:39,010
But, like, I'll be there for, like, emotional support, I guess.

1036
00:54:42,450 --> 00:54:43,750
Thank you for the question.

1037
00:54:52,540 --> 00:54:53,820
Okay, I got another good question.

1038
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:54,760
It's from the back.

1039
00:54:56,340 --> 00:54:57,140
Here we go.

1040
00:54:57,320 --> 00:54:58,160
Oh, the bad questions.

1041
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:00,280
The loners out there.

1042
00:55:02,980 --> 00:55:03,360
Okay.

1043
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:04,940
We're taking a long, slow, long...

1044
00:55:04,940 --> 00:55:05,660
Oh, there's a camera.

1045
00:55:05,860 --> 00:55:06,220
Oh, no.

1046
00:55:06,340 --> 00:55:06,980
I'm getting out of here.

1047
00:55:07,060 --> 00:55:07,360
Goodbye.

1048
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:07,940
Enjoy.

1049
00:55:08,140 --> 00:55:08,400
Good luck.

1050
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:09,020
No, no, you go.

1051
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:11,940
The microphone's right in front of you.

1052
00:55:13,100 --> 00:55:15,180
I didn't even know that.

1053
00:55:16,220 --> 00:55:17,100
What do you mean don't know?

1054
00:55:17,140 --> 00:55:18,720
There's a camera at the microphone.

1055
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:20,600
What's up, Goki?

1056
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:21,700
Hello.

1057
00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:23,800
Okay, I have a question for you.

1058
00:55:24,380 --> 00:55:24,440
Yeah?

1059
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:30,740
So, uh, what's your favorite nostalgic thing from the 2000s, since you're really into the 2000s stuff?

1060
00:55:30,980 --> 00:55:31,860
In the 2000s.

1061
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:33,760
Is it 2000s to 2010?

1062
00:55:34,820 --> 00:55:35,300
2000s.

1063
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:37,640
Okay, what's the...

1064
00:55:37,640 --> 00:55:38,760
Let's say the first decade.

1065
00:55:39,060 --> 00:55:39,980
The 2000s.

1066
00:55:40,120 --> 00:55:40,880
Like, what is it?

1067
00:55:40,900 --> 00:55:42,700
Like, 2000s to 2010?

1068
00:55:43,140 --> 00:55:45,180
Like, or 2000s, 2000s.

1069
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:45,900
Like, 2000s.

1070
00:55:46,420 --> 00:55:46,800
2000s to 2000s.

1071
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:48,380
Like, Y2K, 2000.

1072
00:55:48,820 --> 00:55:54,640
Yeah, why don't you think, you know, like, emo bands, or like, Neopets, or stuff like that.

1073
00:55:54,840 --> 00:55:55,540
Or even, like, only 2000s.

1074
00:55:55,540 --> 00:55:57,340
Oh, wait, Neopets is 2000s?

1075
00:55:57,380 --> 00:55:57,940
Oh my god.

1076
00:55:58,180 --> 00:55:58,440
Yeah.

1077
00:56:01,580 --> 00:56:03,020
Wait, give me a sec.

1078
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:03,860
Me and me both.

1079
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:05,940
Give me a sec.

1080
00:56:06,100 --> 00:56:07,700
No, Neopets can't be 2000s.

1081
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:08,720
You can't do this to me.

1082
00:56:09,060 --> 00:56:09,200
Yeah.

1083
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:10,660
What?

1084
00:56:12,340 --> 00:56:13,480
Okay, 2000s, okay.

1085
00:56:14,100 --> 00:56:17,780
The 2000s was for, like, college kids, not for me.

1086
00:56:17,780 --> 00:56:18,780
Yeah, for Neopets.

1087
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:20,620
Oh my god.

1088
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:23,930
What was my favorite thing from the 2000s?

1089
00:56:24,820 --> 00:56:25,320
Oh!

1090
00:56:25,780 --> 00:56:28,360
Okay, we're going, like, super nostalgic, nostalgic.

1091
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:29,120
Does anyone...

1092
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:31,260
Okay, sorry for the Zoomers out there.

1093
00:56:31,660 --> 00:56:36,180
But, like, does anyone remember those, like, little robot dogs?

1094
00:56:36,180 --> 00:56:36,940
Oh my god.

1095
00:56:36,940 --> 00:56:38,020
That does, like...

1096
00:56:38,020 --> 00:56:38,640
Oh my god.

1097
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:39,300
Oh my god.

1098
00:56:40,180 --> 00:56:40,600
That's...

1099
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,240
Now that's 2000.

1100
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:43,760
Oh!

1101
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:45,820
The little robot dogs or something?

1102
00:56:46,020 --> 00:56:46,440
Yes!

1103
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:48,340
Yeah, those robot dogs.

1104
00:56:48,580 --> 00:56:52,440
And then, like, they have, like, floppy ears and stuff, and you give them those little bones.

1105
00:56:52,620 --> 00:56:54,700
They were, like, the cuter versions of Furbies.

1106
00:56:54,700 --> 00:57:00,680
Um, I had a Furby, but I think I was, like, way too young for a Furby, because I broke the Furby.

1107
00:57:01,100 --> 00:57:01,700
I, like, ripped...

1108
00:57:01,700 --> 00:57:01,740
Why?

1109
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:04,460
This is not sociopathic behavior, by the way.

1110
00:57:05,260 --> 00:57:05,620
Like...

1111
00:57:05,620 --> 00:57:06,720
How did you break a Furby?

1112
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:09,620
I, like, ripped the fur off of Furby.

1113
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:11,680
But, like, that's not sociopathic, by the way.

1114
00:57:12,260 --> 00:57:12,580
Like...

1115
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:15,620
I...

1116
00:57:15,620 --> 00:57:18,600
I just remember I broke the Furby, and I was always curious.

1117
00:57:18,780 --> 00:57:20,260
I was, like, ooh, why is he always blinking?

1118
00:57:20,420 --> 00:57:21,820
So I, like, peeled...

1119
00:57:21,820 --> 00:57:24,180
Like, not peeled, but I, like, forced open his eyes.

1120
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:24,560
Oh my god.

1121
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:25,880
So then, like, I could feel it.

1122
00:57:26,100 --> 00:57:26,860
The eyes start...

1123
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:28,840
This is not sociopathic, by the way.

1124
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:31,220
I was just a...

1125
00:57:31,220 --> 00:57:33,680
I was just a really curious child.

1126
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:41,580
So, like, I would, like, I liked feeling it forced, trying to close his eyes, but it can't, because I'm, like, holding his eyes open and stuff.

1127
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:44,820
And then the Furby broke, because it couldn't close its eyes anymore.

1128
00:57:45,220 --> 00:57:49,820
And then someone's Fur was, like, ripped... almost, like, you know, ripped off.

1129
00:57:50,120 --> 00:57:53,560
Because I was very curious to how it worked and everything.

1130
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:55,700
And I turned out okay, by the way.

1131
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:56,760
I turned out okay.

1132
00:57:57,760 --> 00:57:59,020
You're a beautiful girl!

1133
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:00,020
How are you all out?

1134
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:01,440
That's messed up.

1135
00:58:01,540 --> 00:58:03,080
But yes, um...

1136
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:04,820
Okay, but, like, they're Furbies.

1137
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:06,480
Like, they're so fucking weird.

1138
00:58:06,660 --> 00:58:07,900
Like, they're so...

1139
00:58:09,220 --> 00:58:11,020
Are you using a Doki Furby, then?

1140
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:11,660
Yup.

1141
00:58:11,940 --> 00:58:12,760
Oh god, no.

1142
00:58:14,180 --> 00:58:16,100
God, it's... that's so ugly.

1143
00:58:17,300 --> 00:58:19,400
I don't know if people think Furbies are cute.

1144
00:58:19,540 --> 00:58:20,020
They're so...

1145
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:23,680
They're... they're... they're... they look like serial killers.

1146
00:58:27,260 --> 00:58:30,700
Like, we all watched the... the Furby dog.

1147
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:32,160
Like, y'all, that shit was scary.

1148
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:35,080
Like...

1149
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:36,700
Alright, but yes, good question.

1150
00:58:37,140 --> 00:58:37,980
Good question.

1151
00:58:38,260 --> 00:58:39,360
You need to sit back now.

1152
00:58:40,620 --> 00:58:42,280
I got another one from the back!

1153
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:43,600
Whoa!

1154
00:58:44,140 --> 00:58:46,640
The back is getting some love right now!

1155
00:58:47,020 --> 00:58:48,860
Yeah, I mean, they're sitting back there all by themselves.

1156
00:58:48,860 --> 00:58:49,100
Like...

1157
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:51,860
I mean, that's a choice, so...

1158
00:58:55,600 --> 00:58:59,240
So we know a VTuber model is really important for a VTuber.

1159
00:58:59,900 --> 00:59:00,960
I wanted to ask...

1160
00:59:01,820 --> 00:59:09,820
In your experience, what's it like commissioning a model from, like, the design and concept all the way to that feeling of wearing it for the first time?

1161
00:59:10,980 --> 00:59:13,740
Hmm, so, skin suit related question.

1162
00:59:13,740 --> 00:59:17,220
Well, um...

1163
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:17,740
Well...

1164
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:22,780
It was definitely very difficult design-wise, because it's like...

1165
00:59:23,420 --> 00:59:24,580
I was very...

1166
00:59:24,580 --> 00:59:28,900
Because I was like, do I go stick with the original four-plus-year-old design?

1167
00:59:28,900 --> 00:59:30,920
Or, like, go with something new?

1168
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:32,920
That felt more like me.

1169
00:59:32,920 --> 00:59:39,300
Because, like I said before, Retro Joki wasn't really...

1170
00:59:39,300 --> 00:59:40,420
Like...

1171
00:59:40,420 --> 00:59:44,400
Retro Joki had a personality before I took over her.

1172
00:59:44,900 --> 00:59:45,200
Um...

1173
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:46,600
And then, like, I par...

1174
00:59:46,600 --> 00:59:51,120
Like, as a parasite, I basically controlled Retro Joki and made it into me.

1175
00:59:51,360 --> 00:59:55,340
So she was, like, somebody else before she became me.

1176
00:59:55,340 --> 00:59:57,220
And then, uh...

1177
00:59:57,220 --> 00:59:59,500
So, like, Retro Joki wasn't really, like, fit...

1178
00:59:59,500 --> 01:00:06,360
I never really thought that Retro Joki, like, fit me a hundred percent, personality-wise.

1179
01:00:06,700 --> 01:00:10,360
So, like, I wanted to make something that was more me.

1180
01:00:10,820 --> 01:00:12,400
As, like, in terms of, like, what I play.

1181
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:16,720
And, like, how, like, I conduct myself and everything.

1182
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:18,760
So it was a very tough process.

1183
01:00:18,940 --> 01:00:22,140
I, like, as you guys saw in the, um...

1184
01:00:22,140 --> 01:00:23,820
2.0 review... reveal.

1185
01:00:24,980 --> 01:00:25,380
Um...

1186
01:00:25,380 --> 01:00:29,140
We went through a lot of designs before we settled in.

1187
01:00:29,260 --> 01:00:31,520
Like, at one point, I looked like Shibuya HAL.

1188
01:00:32,040 --> 01:00:32,600
And, uh...

1189
01:00:33,740 --> 01:00:35,920
So we went through a lot of iteration.

1190
01:00:36,460 --> 01:00:36,720
And it...

1191
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:42,300
Right until, like, I debuted 2.0, as in the one you see right now, I was scared.

1192
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:44,100
I was like, what if they don't like it?

1193
01:00:44,580 --> 01:00:45,720
Oh my god, that's good.

1194
01:00:45,780 --> 01:00:46,460
That's the worst part.

1195
01:00:46,460 --> 01:00:47,740
I was like, oh my god.

1196
01:00:48,100 --> 01:00:49,300
Because it was a whole redesign.

1197
01:00:49,700 --> 01:00:50,860
It was a whole new brand.

1198
01:00:51,680 --> 01:00:53,780
Like, went from theme to bounty hunter.

1199
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:54,620
What a job.

1200
01:00:54,760 --> 01:00:56,540
Like, where's the connection between those two?

1201
01:00:58,180 --> 01:00:58,620
Uh...

1202
01:00:59,500 --> 01:00:59,940
So...

1203
01:00:59,940 --> 01:01:00,920
It was definitely...

1204
01:01:00,920 --> 01:01:03,420
It took months to figure it out.

1205
01:01:03,580 --> 01:01:08,260
I really appreciate my mom to be, like, to put up with that.

1206
01:01:08,420 --> 01:01:10,760
Because, like, obviously, they're very busy.

1207
01:01:10,900 --> 01:01:12,640
Like, I'm not their only client.

1208
01:01:13,560 --> 01:01:14,000
So...

1209
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:16,160
So, like, at one point...

1210
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:16,460
I don't know...

1211
01:01:16,460 --> 01:01:17,500
I don't think I've said this before.

1212
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:23,180
But, like, in the very beginning, they were like, look, if we can't, like, settle on a design though...

1213
01:01:23,180 --> 01:01:23,820
Like, I don't know.

1214
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:25,200
I don't know, Doki.

1215
01:01:25,340 --> 01:01:28,420
Like, I don't know if we could keep working if you can't even settle on a design.

1216
01:01:28,420 --> 01:01:31,900
Because I have a lot of clients and I'm like, okay, I gotta make this work.

1217
01:01:35,220 --> 01:01:36,320
So, it's just...

1218
01:01:36,320 --> 01:01:37,380
It takes a lot.

1219
01:01:37,580 --> 01:01:38,640
Because it's, like...

1220
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:39,500
You have to figure out...

1221
01:01:40,260 --> 01:01:41,060
Also, like...

1222
01:01:41,060 --> 01:01:42,460
I don't know if this is a hot take or not.

1223
01:01:42,680 --> 01:01:44,020
But, like, I think...

1224
01:01:44,020 --> 01:01:48,500
I do not like it when skin suits are very complicated design-wise.

1225
01:01:49,140 --> 01:01:54,080
Because I feel like keeping it simple is the best because it's the most memorable.

1226
01:01:54,660 --> 01:01:56,920
At best, like, if you...

1227
01:01:56,920 --> 01:02:02,020
If you have, like, a good silhouette and, like, memorable, like, design aspects...

1228
01:02:02,020 --> 01:02:02,760
That's fine.

1229
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:03,540
I hate clutter.

1230
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:05,500
I just don't like clutter on a design.

1231
01:02:07,840 --> 01:02:08,320
So...

1232
01:02:08,320 --> 01:02:08,880
Yeah.

1233
01:02:09,820 --> 01:02:10,060
Yeah.

1234
01:02:10,260 --> 01:02:11,420
Keeping it simple as always.

1235
01:02:11,500 --> 01:02:12,700
As long as it's memorable...

1236
01:02:12,700 --> 01:02:15,680
It can't be, like, too simple where you're just, like...

1237
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:18,920
Default anime girl with cat ears number 254.

1238
01:02:19,900 --> 01:02:21,000
Like, it can't be that simple.

1239
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:24,420
But, like, more so of, like, have something memorable.

1240
01:02:24,660 --> 01:02:25,840
Like, a very memorable trait.

1241
01:02:25,840 --> 01:02:29,840
But don't over-clutter yourself, like, with everything.

1242
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:30,360
Like, you...

1243
01:02:30,360 --> 01:02:31,000
Like a...

1244
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:32,260
Like a sparkle dog.

1245
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:35,860
Yes.

1246
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:37,020
That's my answer.

1247
01:02:37,720 --> 01:02:37,940
Okay.

1248
01:02:38,200 --> 01:02:38,560
Thank you.

1249
01:02:39,720 --> 01:02:40,140
Yeah!

1250
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:42,820
Okay.

1251
01:02:43,100 --> 01:02:43,300
Okay.

1252
01:02:43,560 --> 01:02:44,920
I got somebody right over here.

1253
01:02:45,040 --> 01:02:46,240
I got somebody right over here.

1254
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:46,740
Woo!

1255
01:02:47,260 --> 01:02:47,680
Oh!

1256
01:02:47,720 --> 01:02:48,480
They're going from the front!

1257
01:02:48,760 --> 01:02:49,440
I'm going to hit them off.

1258
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:51,440
Oh, no!

1259
01:02:51,460 --> 01:02:51,780
They're running!

1260
01:02:51,960 --> 01:02:52,200
Oh, no!

1261
01:02:52,280 --> 01:02:52,540
They're running!

1262
01:02:52,540 --> 01:02:53,520
I don't think I'm going to fit enough for this.

1263
01:02:53,540 --> 01:02:53,800
Are you running?

1264
01:02:54,740 --> 01:02:55,720
No, I'm talking here.

1265
01:03:02,430 --> 01:03:02,750
Hello!

1266
01:03:03,730 --> 01:03:04,090
Oh, hi!

1267
01:03:04,910 --> 01:03:06,670
I think you might have to lean in a little closer.

1268
01:03:08,150 --> 01:03:08,470
Hi!

1269
01:03:09,090 --> 01:03:09,850
Would you like a chair?

1270
01:03:11,610 --> 01:03:11,930
Sure!

1271
01:03:12,490 --> 01:03:13,650
Wait, is that your question?

1272
01:03:14,010 --> 01:03:14,890
Alright, next question.

1273
01:03:15,050 --> 01:03:15,570
Next person.

1274
01:03:18,310 --> 01:03:23,750
As a connoisseur of the weird and unhinged, what is your favorite bit of skin suit lore?

1275
01:03:23,950 --> 01:03:25,270
Preferably the weirdest one.

1276
01:03:26,090 --> 01:03:28,010
My favorite skin suit lore?

1277
01:03:28,170 --> 01:03:29,330
The weirdest one?

1278
01:03:29,730 --> 01:03:31,150
But I'm not a freak.

1279
01:03:36,430 --> 01:03:41,750
Like, the weirdest one is that underneath all of this is that I'm a tomato.

1280
01:03:41,750 --> 01:03:44,030
How much weirder can that get?

1281
01:03:44,310 --> 01:03:48,090
Like, who else do you know is, like, an actual tomato?

1282
01:03:52,750 --> 01:03:56,490
I don't know if you guys know this, but I make up my lore as we go along.

1283
01:03:56,710 --> 01:04:02,200
Like, it comes up on the fly.

1284
01:04:02,200 --> 01:04:10,560
Like, I don't have, like, a hidden- I don't have, like, a notebook with, like, 200 pages of secret doki lore.

1285
01:04:10,940 --> 01:04:12,820
And literally, I just be like, that's funny.

1286
01:04:12,940 --> 01:04:13,800
That's my lore now.

1287
01:04:15,360 --> 01:04:17,020
If that's what you want us to think.

1288
01:04:17,980 --> 01:04:18,400
Sure.

1289
01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:22,720
Sure, you can go in there with your whole conspiracy theory.

1290
01:04:24,640 --> 01:04:25,680
I got a notebook!

1291
01:04:25,980 --> 01:04:28,320
Just like how we all know the Earth is flat.

1292
01:04:28,320 --> 01:04:29,140
That's hot.

1293
01:04:34,040 --> 01:04:35,120
Yeah, that's my answer.

1294
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:35,820
Yeah, that's it.

1295
01:04:38,080 --> 01:04:39,420
Sorry, I'm not a freak.

1296
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:46,340
Okay, I think- I think we're coming up to the end here, but I- Whoa!

1297
01:04:47,620 --> 01:04:48,560
Last final question.

1298
01:04:48,580 --> 01:04:49,240
Possibly about some announcements.

1299
01:04:50,280 --> 01:04:51,560
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

1300
01:04:54,020 --> 01:04:54,340
What?

1301
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:55,320
What are her announcements?

1302
01:04:56,700 --> 01:04:58,420
Oh, they're not very special, by the way.

1303
01:04:58,420 --> 01:05:00,960
Yeah, please don't go in- please don't go in with, like, super high hopes.

1304
01:05:01,100 --> 01:05:02,560
There's, like, not really special announcements.

1305
01:05:07,480 --> 01:05:07,880
What?

1306
01:05:08,580 --> 01:05:08,980
What?

1307
01:05:12,660 --> 01:05:17,200
Okay, so I think what you wanted- what you asked is, uh, who would like a photo with everybody?

1308
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:18,280
Yeah!

1309
01:05:18,860 --> 01:05:20,400
Wait, that was the last question?

1310
01:05:21,420 --> 01:05:25,100
We have, uh, we have our photographer extraordinaire, Kazuki somewhere.

1311
01:05:25,980 --> 01:05:27,880
Uh, so we'll be taking two photos.

1312
01:05:28,700 --> 01:05:37,120
Um, one where Kazuki's on the stage looking at the crowd, and then I'm forcing him to run all the way to the back of the room, and then take a photo with everybody and Goki.

1313
01:05:37,260 --> 01:05:37,600
Sound good?

1314
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:38,740
All right, yeah!

1315
01:05:39,040 --> 01:05:44,860
Also, everybody, if you have any gifts or letters for Mint and I, I'll be accepting gifts for Mint as well.

1316
01:05:45,320 --> 01:05:48,240
Please just- I don't know, where do we- where do they leave them, tech guy?

1317
01:05:48,460 --> 01:05:49,280
I don't know.

1318
01:05:51,060 --> 01:05:52,180
Table is over there.

1319
01:05:52,360 --> 01:05:53,320
There are a couple of volunteers.

1320
01:05:53,700 --> 01:05:59,100
Okay, wherever the- wherever the emcee guy pointed to, if you have gifts and letters for Mint and I, please leave that at the table there.

1321
01:05:59,260 --> 01:06:02,580
We apologize that, uh, there was some miscommunication about yesterday.

1322
01:06:03,040 --> 01:06:10,340
Also, like, Mint and I were super frazzled, so, like, our routine was off because we were, like, we were trying to fix Mint's audio issue live.

1323
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:16,640
So, like, I forgot to tell you guys about the gift situation, so, like, everybody was confused.

1324
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:22,780
But we are accepting Mint's gifts now, and, like, just leave it at the table and then she'll get them as well.

1325
01:06:23,520 --> 01:06:26,460
And if you have- oh, wait, no, you're all gonna be there, so never mind.

1326
01:06:26,540 --> 01:06:29,000
I was just saying, if you can't leave it, could you make it to the panel?

1327
01:06:29,100 --> 01:06:31,160
And I'm like, no, they're all at the panel, where are you staying?

1328
01:06:33,560 --> 01:06:34,880
So, just leave it at the table.

1329
01:06:35,580 --> 01:06:38,560
And you'll get, like, 50 years of good luck because it's, like, a shrine thing.

1330
01:06:40,360 --> 01:06:45,000
I'll bless you with 50 years of good luck if you leave a gift or a letter.

1331
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:45,100
Okay.

1332
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:46,480
Worth it.

1333
01:06:46,700 --> 01:06:47,040
Worth it.

1334
01:06:47,800 --> 01:06:48,660
Kaz, do you want to come out?

1335
01:06:50,220 --> 01:06:50,540
Yes.

1336
01:06:51,080 --> 01:06:52,560
Everyone give a round of applause for Kazki!

1337
01:07:04,190 --> 01:07:05,090
Did you do it?

1338
01:07:07,470 --> 01:07:07,990
Free work!

1339
01:07:09,390 --> 01:07:10,030
Free work!

1340
01:07:19,610 --> 01:07:21,130
Okay, Kaz, thank you.

1341
01:07:21,250 --> 01:07:22,070
Alright, you're running to the back.

1342
01:07:22,150 --> 01:07:22,790
He's running to the back.

1343
01:07:22,890 --> 01:07:23,470
Almost done.

1344
01:07:23,570 --> 01:07:24,110
Almost done.

1345
01:07:27,490 --> 01:07:28,530
So, how's your day going?

1346
01:07:30,210 --> 01:07:31,850
Wait, what were you asking?

1347
01:07:32,370 --> 01:07:32,650
What?

1348
01:07:34,550 --> 01:07:36,650
Whoever answers the question, I don't know.

1349
01:07:36,990 --> 01:07:40,070
Our day literally started, like, doing this.

1350
01:07:47,940 --> 01:07:49,620
Oh, you're running on two hours of sleep.

1351
01:07:49,740 --> 01:07:50,500
Good for you.

1352
01:07:50,960 --> 01:07:51,780
Good for you!

1353
01:07:52,340 --> 01:07:53,240
They're not gonna make it.

1354
01:07:53,260 --> 01:07:53,620
Good for you.

1355
01:07:54,340 --> 01:07:56,040
Yeah, you're not gonna make it.

1356
01:08:02,670 --> 01:08:03,610
How's the ketchup guy doing?

1357
01:08:03,770 --> 01:08:04,050
Oh, okay.

1358
01:08:04,350 --> 01:08:04,450
Ready?

1359
01:08:05,350 --> 01:08:06,170
Kazki's back there.

1360
01:08:11,700 --> 01:08:13,000
What even is the camera?

1361
01:08:22,710 --> 01:08:23,390
Alright, we're good?

1362
01:08:24,770 --> 01:08:25,130
Awesome!

1363
01:08:25,470 --> 01:08:25,730
Okay!

1364
01:08:26,090 --> 01:08:26,450
Woo!

1365
01:08:30,870 --> 01:08:31,850
Was that the end?

1366
01:08:32,550 --> 01:08:34,330
Do you want to cap it or do you want a couple more questions?

1367
01:08:34,330 --> 01:08:34,930
What do you think?

1368
01:08:35,150 --> 01:08:36,030
I'll do one more.

1369
01:08:36,170 --> 01:08:39,370
One special dragoon gets the last question.

1370
01:08:39,370 --> 01:08:40,290
One special dragoon.

1371
01:08:40,490 --> 01:08:42,790
One very special dragoon.

1372
01:08:43,070 --> 01:08:43,550
Oh, okay.

1373
01:08:44,990 --> 01:08:48,330
The most specialist of all dragoons.

1374
01:08:48,330 --> 01:08:48,690
Oh, wait, hold on.

1375
01:08:48,830 --> 01:08:49,530
They're doing another picture.

1376
01:08:49,670 --> 01:08:50,710
Sorry, they're doing one more picture.

1377
01:08:50,990 --> 01:08:51,870
With the lights on.

1378
01:09:03,550 --> 01:09:06,450
Okay, now, who's gonna be the last question?

1379
01:09:12,500 --> 01:09:13,680
Oh, my gosh.

1380
01:09:13,820 --> 01:09:15,140
It's like they're fighting, but no...

1381
01:09:15,140 --> 01:09:15,420
You know what?

1382
01:09:15,500 --> 01:09:16,600
They're not very loud.

1383
01:09:16,900 --> 01:09:18,040
Either side's not very loud.

1384
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:24,900
I mean, that person's wearing a suit.

1385
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:27,020
Oh, there's someone yelling.

1386
01:09:27,620 --> 01:09:28,320
Oh, no.

1387
01:09:28,460 --> 01:09:30,280
Okay, I gotta make a hard decision here, right?

1388
01:09:30,820 --> 01:09:31,260
Yeah.

1389
01:09:31,540 --> 01:09:35,440
Do you want me to go this way?

1390
01:09:36,100 --> 01:09:36,520
No.

1391
01:09:36,840 --> 01:09:37,460
Or this way?

1392
01:09:37,740 --> 01:09:39,660
The whole responsibility is on you.

1393
01:09:40,040 --> 01:09:42,760
I take zero blame if it's a shitty question.

1394
01:09:47,140 --> 01:09:53,060
Okay, each side's representative come up, and I will decide if you have a good question, and I will pick between one of you.

1395
01:09:53,680 --> 01:09:54,540
There, you come up.

1396
01:09:55,560 --> 01:09:57,280
No, make them do rock, paper, scissors.

1397
01:09:57,780 --> 01:09:58,360
Oh, yeah!

1398
01:09:58,860 --> 01:10:00,020
Okay, that's better, yeah.

1399
01:10:03,280 --> 01:10:04,300
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

1400
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:05,980
Okay, okay, you got two of you, you got two of you.

1401
01:10:09,970 --> 01:10:11,510
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

1402
01:10:11,590 --> 01:10:11,950
Your deadline.

1403
01:10:12,270 --> 01:10:13,110
Wait, okay, let's go back over there, ketchup.

1404
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:32,740
It's not a good question.

1405
01:10:33,160 --> 01:10:34,480
No, it's all right, it's all ok.

1406
01:10:34,540 --> 01:10:35,060
Okay, fine.

1407
01:10:36,260 --> 01:10:37,840
activities, it's just an instrument really.

1408
01:10:37,900 --> 01:10:38,140
We're doing with rock, paper, scissors.

1409
01:10:38,900 --> 01:10:40,120
Then they deserve to answer.

1410
01:10:40,120 --> 01:10:41,740
How quick is their jacket?

1411
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:48,300
Where are you getting that?" Alright.

1412
01:10:51,430 --> 01:10:51,910
Awww!

1413
01:10:53,350 --> 01:10:54,330
Don't even do that!

1414
01:10:54,330 --> 01:11:00,410
She threw scissors.

1415
01:11:00,670 --> 01:11:01,210
She was ready.

1416
01:11:03,490 --> 01:11:04,670
Hi, Lookie!

1417
01:11:05,230 --> 01:11:05,870
Hello!

1418
01:11:07,150 --> 01:11:10,410
Okay, so I was introduced to you...

1419
01:11:11,690 --> 01:11:14,310
by... because you're playing Apex.

1420
01:11:14,790 --> 01:11:15,290
Yeah.

1421
01:11:15,570 --> 01:11:17,050
Because you are a FPS.

1422
01:11:17,470 --> 01:11:18,190
FPS.

1423
01:11:20,270 --> 01:11:20,910
Me too.

1424
01:11:21,010 --> 01:11:22,010
Yeah, yeah.

1425
01:11:23,070 --> 01:11:25,570
My question is...

1426
01:11:28,870 --> 01:11:29,470
It's okay.

1427
01:11:29,790 --> 01:11:30,090
It's okay.

1428
01:11:30,210 --> 01:11:30,870
You're the last question.

1429
01:11:30,990 --> 01:11:31,390
No pressure.

1430
01:11:34,350 --> 01:11:35,030
Everybody's waiting.

1431
01:11:35,170 --> 01:11:37,990
You're the last question to end off this entire panel, but that's okay.

1432
01:11:37,990 --> 01:11:49,190
We know that you are friends with a bunch of FPS players.

1433
01:11:49,810 --> 01:11:50,250
Yeah.

1434
01:11:50,250 --> 01:11:50,370
Yeah?

1435
01:11:51,470 --> 01:11:57,630
For Overwatch, what is your ideal team members?

1436
01:11:58,650 --> 01:12:00,190
Ideal team members?

1437
01:12:00,730 --> 01:12:01,410
Okay.

1438
01:12:01,490 --> 01:12:02,610
We have to put a team together.

1439
01:12:02,990 --> 01:12:04,590
We have to put a team together.

1440
01:12:04,590 --> 01:12:04,770
We have to put a team together today.

1441
01:12:05,310 --> 01:12:05,750
Well...

1442
01:12:05,750 --> 01:12:07,930
Well, it's gonna be 5v5, right?

1443
01:12:08,250 --> 01:12:08,490
Yes.

1444
01:12:08,930 --> 01:12:11,410
So all four of them will be from Korea then.

1445
01:12:16,410 --> 01:12:26,790
Because we all know, if you're like an Overwatch, if you used to watch Overwatch League, and you used to be into Overwatch, sort of like the best players are from Korea.

1446
01:12:26,790 --> 01:12:27,350
So...

1447
01:12:27,350 --> 01:12:28,770
They are.

1448
01:12:29,070 --> 01:12:29,830
They are.

1449
01:12:31,350 --> 01:12:37,590
So, I don't really care, like, who's gonna be on the team, as long as they're all from Korea.

1450
01:12:37,950 --> 01:12:39,930
Because I know they're gonna clutch it for me.

1451
01:12:43,270 --> 01:12:48,830
To be fair, I'm not up to date with the new, the new, current hit players.

1452
01:12:49,110 --> 01:12:52,030
I know more about when Overwatch League used to be alive.

1453
01:12:53,530 --> 01:12:54,790
So I don't know...

1454
01:12:54,790 --> 01:12:57,750
I don't know who's still playing.

1455
01:13:02,750 --> 01:13:03,030
Like...

1456
01:13:03,310 --> 01:13:05,650
500 million dollars down the drain, I guess.

1457
01:13:09,650 --> 01:13:11,390
No, it's even more than that.

1458
01:13:11,530 --> 01:13:12,790
Like, I don't know if you guys...

1459
01:13:12,790 --> 01:13:19,250
Okay, for those who don't know, actual, like, football team owners invested in the Overwatch League.

1460
01:13:19,570 --> 01:13:23,210
So, like, that's gotta go into the billions at that point.

1461
01:13:23,210 --> 01:13:26,070
Like, I don't know how the fuck they're getting their money back.

1462
01:13:26,270 --> 01:13:27,810
But, like, at least we enjoyed it.

1463
01:13:28,790 --> 01:13:29,230
Like...

1464
01:13:29,230 --> 01:13:31,350
At least the viewers enjoyed it.

1465
01:13:31,870 --> 01:13:33,510
But yes, that's my answer.

1466
01:13:34,190 --> 01:13:39,210
As long as they're from Korea, I know they have the skills to win this for me.

1467
01:13:42,510 --> 01:13:43,890
Okay, guys, that's a wrap.

1468
01:13:44,010 --> 01:13:44,730
Thank you so much.

1469
01:13:44,850 --> 01:13:46,470
Don't be very much for a round of applause.

1470
01:13:46,930 --> 01:13:47,850
Thank you, everybody.

1471
01:13:53,160 --> 01:13:59,120
For Anime Revolution, like I said, if you have any gifts or letters for Mint or I, please leave it at the table.

1472
01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:01,780
Bye-bye, everybody.

1473
01:14:02,860 --> 01:14:07,940
Bye-bye, everybody.
