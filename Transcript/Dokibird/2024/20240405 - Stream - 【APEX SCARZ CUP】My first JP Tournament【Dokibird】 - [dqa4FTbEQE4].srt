All right, trio mode.

9
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:06,100
Wait, is it only Stormpoint for trios?

10
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,540
No, I'm pretty sure we have different...

11
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:09,300
There's no way it's only Stormpoint.

12
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,580
I think we played it once.

13
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:15,760
I'm pretty sure we're rotating maps, right guys?

14
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:16,700
Oh, we have World's Head.

15
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:17,460
We have World's Head.

16
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:19,600
There's like...

17
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,920
There's no way...

18
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:24,020
We are landing staging.

19
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,440
That is not bad.

20
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,920
Wouldn't call it the best...

21
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,080
Or the team's next to us.

22
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:29,760

Let's go.

56
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:14,650
Exactly.

57
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:18,630
I've heard it from the previous rank number one in Apex.

58
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:19,910
Just play Overwatch.

59
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:21,670
If you want to aim train.

60
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:22,410
That's true.

61
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:26,370
A lot of like the ex Apex players are Overwatch players.

62
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:28,410
I mean, said he was an ex-Oberwatch player.

63
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:30,050
Yeah.

64
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:41,070
exactly yeah yeah too you're the next overwatch player i
remember i used to watch you in overwatch wait true we have

65
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:49,810
a chance wait we have our own celly except let's go exactly
except the original celly might be better but like we have

66
00:04:49,810 --> 00:05:01,170
our own i'm not too sure i'm not i'm not well versed but
Yeah, yeah.

67
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:02,630
We have our own semi.

68
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:05,170
In a 1v3, perhaps?

69
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:05,990
Yeah, yeah.

70
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:10,370
We just gotta make sure he's alone and then we all shoot him
at the same time.

71
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:11,630
Like we can take that.

72
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:14,470
Like he's not the pro in his team, but like that's okay.

73
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:16,990
He's just content creating.

74
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:19,430
Yeah, he's a content creator like, bro.

75
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:20,710
Yeah, yeah.

76
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:23,490
Our team is like the content team.

77
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:26,690
We're at this point.

78
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:28,130
We're the content team.

79
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:29,870
Oh shit.

85
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:39,470

of i algs and then after that half of it's like i was broken

86
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:47,410
i needed someone i needed someone else to do the yeah that's
why you're you got after pro league you went to overwatch

87
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:55,310
the best game for men yep and and guess what egg yep that
did not help yeah i'm gonna say overwatch is not known for

88
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:56,950
mental care just say

89
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:12,310
like become very just immune to toxicity or you become the
toxicity oh yeah that's so true that's a good way to

90
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:19,430
describe it yeah yeah yeah because i i know that like people
be like yeah i came from overwatch and you're like oh i i i

91
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:31,430
get it man should i be this dude's friend oh my god it's so
true it's like which part of overwatch the the really bad

92
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:42,190
side or the good one which overwatch which type of overwatch
player are you at least you didn't come from na valorant i

93
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:51,230
don't know if like jp valorant is any better but like na
valorant is is a whole new side of toxicity um i remember

94
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:58,270
playing in beta in na that was funny it's kind of thing it's
like you just breathe and they they start like grossing you

95
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:09,950
oh true true My first day on NA Valorant, I got called a
gamer word and I was like, all right, I'm just gonna mute

96
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:10,730
everything.

97
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:13,030
Why so fast?

98
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:19,790
I literally just like literally said one word and I was
like, well, time to mute everybody.

99
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:21,030
Goodbye.

100
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:21,830
Goodbye.

101
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:23,250
Goodbye, NA Valorant.

102
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:24,050
Goodbye.

103
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:29,850
Yeah, you see, actually, I've been playing a lot of
Japanese, you know, Japan.

104
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:38,990
in Valorant and it's not it's not like it's not that bad to
be honest it's just no no one is like it's rare to like play

105
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:46,530
with a you know a toxic loud guy but they have their own way
of like trolling they have their own way of being toxic like

106
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:56,110
how so they're just passive aggressive like how so yeah they
talk at like the last second of the game like when you

107
00:08:56,110 --> 00:09:10,010
already yeah you suck fuck you yeah yeah exactly just hold
it in until the last minute like i'm never gonna see you

108
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:20,330
anyway yeah yeah oh that's how they do it here in japan oh
my god i mean i mean that's better it's better than like

109
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:30,690
getting yelled at in the beginning that's true just like
yeah because like in valor and you can't leave he can't

110
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:38,270
leave until like somebody surrenders or like or like play
the full game of someone yelling at you at least they save

111
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:47,010
it till the end you know yeah yeah exactly that's that's
true that is true all right all right do you guys know what

112
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:57,370
what team okay so we're playing bloodhound bangalore and and
what again the fly you guys do you play bloodhound okay i

113
00:09:57,370 --> 00:10:02,010
can play wait okay but I'm not on controller, but like, no
one in Asia is really on controller.

114
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:05,070
So it's not like NA.

115
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:07,450
Oh, no, there's actually a lot.

116
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:09,550
Actually, a lot more than you think.

117
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:13,450
I think it's more everyone in Korea doesn't play a
controller, but in Japan.

118
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:14,150
Oh, that's true.

119
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:14,870
Yeah, yeah.

120
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:15,470
Yeah.

121
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:19,730
But I think like in NA, it's almost like, it's every team
has like a roller player.

122
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:20,690
Yeah.

123
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:21,170
Yeah.

124
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:21,890
Yeah.

125
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:27,150
So it's so like, you know, NA tournaments are so scary.

126
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:41,850
i'll be like hey i'm the m and k player here hello please be
nice disadvantage disadvantage sorry i'm my team sorry for

127
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:53,310
being a sorry for being a nerf for your team i have the
wrong input never okay usually play i can play do you go by

128
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:54,750
doky or like oh

129
00:10:58,570 --> 00:10:59,370
All right, all right.

130
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:00,670
I can't I just not Val.

131
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:05,830
I can do either blood or blood or being Blood or burn.

132
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:09,350
Yeah, I play uh bang and then okay.

133
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:16,670
I do blood just yell at me just micro management for scans
Wait, let me just like watch a little clip, you know, like a

134
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:24,990
little vaude review A little vaude right before a
tournament, you know That's when you should water view

135
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:32,850
probably What vaude Let's see, DSG is playing Bloodhound
caustic wraith.

136
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:34,030
Alright, that's interesting.

137
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:35,710
That's already interesting.

138
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:37,650
That's already something that's different.

139
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:40,490
Okay, but DSG is like meta crafters.

140
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:41,810
Caustic seems to be the meta.

141
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:47,130
Yeah, I see a lot of caustic now because of like how fuck
the zones are.

142
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:50,370
So they have to like have caustic to zone out things.

143
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:57,650
The roller player is usually on the Bloodhound.

144
00:11:57,990 --> 00:11:59,670
But like, since we don't have a roller.

145
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:11,890
I've never held a controller in my life man Like actually I
bought a $500 controller And I used it like And I only used

146
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:20,810
it for not Apex You know those battle beaver controllers
that every fucking Apex Pro That advertised I used it like

147
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:29,190
one time And I did it for Apex And then every other time
it's just for other games that need controller I can't I

148
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:37,970
don't know how to do it's so difficult i can't either bro i
get so mad when i'm using control like why the fuck am i so

149
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:48,690
bad it's like it's like i touch a controller it's like all
right i'm going back to mbk ggs i'm so hard i don't but then

150
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:58,410
like but then when it hits when that aim assist hits though
oh my god i'm like okay yeah, but it hits it when it hits it

151
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:07,030
hits like one out of ten fights you miss everything or like
nine out of ten fights you miss everything in that one fight

152
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:14,270
just one clip yeah and then you're like oh controllers OP
what the fuck is this bullshit and then the one out of ten

153
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:16,950
it was this is broken

154
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:31,770
okay from what I've observed we should play um we should
play caustic caustic okay not it yeah i don't know what that

496
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:03,870

501
00:32:10,670 --> 00:32:12,230
We don't have to do anything crazy.

502
00:32:13,010 --> 00:32:17,890

505
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:46,820

angles.

506
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:50,360
Oh yeah, you can even play up there.

507
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:51,420

508
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:52,220
They're running?

509
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:53,600

511
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:55,560

514
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:59,120
They're still in the house.

I'm gonna check our rotate.

519
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:13,980

520
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:15,500
Okay.

521
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:21,680

00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,920
Wait, can we make it over here?

Why did the team push us?

00:39:36,470 --> 00:39:37,570
They have a free rotate.

667
00:39:37,970 --> 00:39:40,090
They needed the kill points.

668
00:39:41,990 --> 00:39:43,490
At least we got three kill points, right?

We're gonna play for this beacon scan under on low ground.

896
00:58:25,320 --> 00:58:26,520

00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:30,400
We should scan it right now.

899
00:58:31,140 --> 00:58:32,380
They zipped up on this height.

900
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:33,020

00:58:42,340 --> 00:58:43,140
Tactical cooldown.

904
00:58:43,360 --> 00:58:43,820
Tactical cooldown.

905
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:45,520
I think no one's here.

906
00:58:45,940 --> 00:58:46,640
Scan the beacon.

907
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:47,880

Scanning?

918
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:08,820
No one should be in this compound, I think.

00:59:09,140 --> 00:59:09,600
I don't think.

920
00:59:09,700 --> 00:59:10,860

Okay, okay.

01:01:21,340 --> 01:01:21,920
All right, I'm dead.

996
01:01:25,540 --> 01:01:27,460
Here's an armor swab you're raising.

01:01:47,340 --> 01:02:04,240
you should die yo i already left i already left bro leave us
alone you gotta worry about something else oh oh no the

1000
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:15,700
timing bro they took the building yeah at the same time they
like yeah they did they landed as soon as we like flew yeah

1001
01:02:15,700 --> 01:02:26,140
they they got there like before us one second before us bro
the timing they were like going they were like going to the

1002
01:02:26,140 --> 01:02:35,900
tree but they like stopped and then you went back to the
building instead yeah they knew they're like this is some

1003
01:02:35,900 --> 01:02:45,040
early easy kp right there we could have fought them though
but you got shot from the height yeah i just died to someone

1004
01:02:45,040 --> 01:02:55,840
else yeah he was like come here come here ty is just like
three meters away from you i went to the the ping and then

1005
01:02:55,860 --> 01:02:57,900
And I was like, oh, wait, Yuri's is not at the ping.

1006
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:00,800
Yeah, I think I'm right.

1007
01:03:00,900 --> 01:03:03,540
Because they got there first.

1008
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:04,200
Yeah, yeah.

1009
01:03:04,360 --> 01:03:08,100
And then Yuri's and I swerved because I was like, there's
people there.

1010
01:03:08,260 --> 01:03:10,220
Maybe we shouldn't go there.

1011
01:03:12,260 --> 01:03:14,660
Taya, you listen to the IGL too much.

1012
01:03:14,920 --> 01:03:15,320
Yeah.

1013
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:16,940
You have to think for yourself.

1014
01:03:17,240 --> 01:03:17,900
Can't comprehend.

1015
01:03:20,760 --> 01:03:25,840
You gotta let your rat brain come in and think against the
IGL.

1016
01:03:25,860 --> 01:03:50,040
sometimes because like Yuri's left us to die I couldn't I
couldn't get my plus 60 damage I just want like that one

1017
01:03:50,040 --> 01:04:01,440
that one was that one was the IJL's fault I don't know there
seems to be pattern all right all right all right i don't

1018
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:12,340
know it seemed a hundred percent like so good and then we're
just like dead dead we got we got purpees we're ready to go

1019
01:04:12,340 --> 01:04:21,800

1020
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:30,560

been an honorable death but we just died by everyone in the

1021
01:04:30,560 --> 01:04:39,200
lodge yeah everyone just wanted to everyone just wanted to
kill us our booties were just too too much it was we just

01:06:00,680 --> 01:06:01,320
Oh, he's so dead.

1031
01:06:01,840 --> 01:06:06,960
Anytime there's a pylon zone, it's so scary, because there's
only cover in pylon.

1032
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:09,380
Or is this Bangalore.

1033
01:06:10,440 --> 01:06:12,000
Or you guys want this solo Bangalore?

1034
01:06:12,140 --> 01:06:12,880
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1035
01:06:12,920 --> 01:06:14,600
The solo Bangalore with Craver?

1036
01:06:16,100 --> 01:06:17,840
This is just one some KP, bro.

1037
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:18,540
Oh, my God.

1038
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:19,660
There's a Watson team.

1039
01:06:19,720 --> 01:06:22,120
Is Watson meta, or are they just fucking big brain?

1040
01:06:22,860 --> 01:06:24,820
They knew the zone was going to be in buildings.

1041
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:26,840
Yeah.

1042
01:06:27,420 --> 01:06:28,940
Yuris, this could have been you, man.

1043
01:06:29,160 --> 01:06:29,760
It's could have been you.

1044
01:06:30,180 --> 01:06:31,260
It could have been us.

1045
01:06:31,420 --> 01:06:33,220
And we should have ratted here, all of us.

1046
01:06:33,640 --> 01:06:34,740
Yeah, just in this corner.

1047
01:06:35,160 --> 01:06:36,420
We don't shoot our guns.

1048
01:06:37,880 --> 01:06:41,600
You just kill his Bangalore and just sit behind this crate.

1049
01:06:45,240 --> 01:06:46,000
Oh, my God.

1050
01:06:48,040 --> 01:06:49,340
This could have been us.

1051
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:50,580
How did I drop there?

1052
01:06:50,820 --> 01:06:53,820
So after this, are we playing duo trio?

1053
01:06:53,840 --> 01:06:55,400
I did solos first?

1054
01:06:55,760 --> 01:06:56,360
I think it's...

1055
01:06:57,020 --> 01:06:57,780
Okay, let me check.

1056
01:06:59,260 --> 01:07:00,200
Yeah, yeah.

1057
01:07:00,540 --> 01:07:01,340
Idiotic adventure.

1058
01:07:02,220 --> 01:07:04,120
Wait, six games, though, right?

1059
01:07:04,300 --> 01:07:05,180
Oh, hey, Will.

Will said our translator, well, my translator, because you
two can read it.

1061
01:07:12,560 --> 01:07:16,700
He said that it's going to be watched for the solo duos.

1062
01:07:17,020 --> 01:07:18,580
Someone's going to do a watch party.

1063
01:07:19,620 --> 01:07:22,080
And then, and then, like, on Discord or something.

1064
01:07:22,320 --> 01:07:25,380
And then, like, we just watch what they're doing so we don't
ghost.

1065
01:07:26,800 --> 01:07:27,940
Like, can we talk?

1066
01:07:29,260 --> 01:07:37,020

01:08:01,640 --> 01:08:03,180
This dude's a rat professional.

1070
01:08:03,480 --> 01:08:04,780
That could be us.

1071
01:08:07,820 --> 01:08:08,980
Who is this guy?

1072
01:08:09,480 --> 01:08:10,480
Yeah, who is this guy?

1073
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:19,400
I would just mad the fuck up and go around that pillar.

1074
01:08:19,880 --> 01:08:21,080
Yeah, let's see that pillar.

1075
01:08:21,280 --> 01:08:22,440
That could've been us!

1076
01:08:22,580 --> 01:08:25,020
Oh my god, that really could've been us.

1077
01:08:25,820 --> 01:08:27,220
You scared he pulled out his gun?

1078
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:30,640
That could've been us.

1079
01:08:33,400 --> 01:08:36,080
This is literally just never going to peak.

1080
01:08:38,280 --> 01:08:39,680
It's actually only seven parties.

1081
01:08:39,940 --> 01:08:40,600
I bet you this rat?

1082
01:08:40,900 --> 01:08:42,140
This rat's going to get top five.

1083
01:08:43,420 --> 01:08:44,260
Right here.

1084
01:08:44,800 --> 01:08:45,520
I think it is.

1085
01:08:45,560 --> 01:08:46,940
The teams are fighting right now.

1086
01:08:47,140 --> 01:08:47,500
Okay, never mind.

1087
01:08:47,740 --> 01:08:48,200
You got scanned.

1088
01:08:49,220 --> 01:08:52,320
If it's not the team in front, then it should be okay.

1089
01:08:55,780 --> 01:08:56,880
No, it's the team in front.

1090
01:08:58,020 --> 01:08:58,640
It's okay.

1091
01:08:58,720 --> 01:08:59,840
They see this one rat.

1092
01:08:59,980 --> 01:09:01,000
They're just going to let him live.

1093
01:09:01,500 --> 01:09:02,140
They need him.

1094
01:09:02,140 --> 01:09:07,940
They need him to live so they can, this guy can like, uh,
help them damage another team.

1095
01:09:09,420 --> 01:09:10,140
That's six.

1096
01:09:11,360 --> 01:09:12,420

He should climb.

1100
01:09:15,320 --> 01:09:16,280
He should climb right.

1282
01:23:54,480 --> 01:23:57,180

1284
01:23:58,740 --> 01:23:59,520

01:26:39,170 --> 01:26:54,590
teammates is your 20 player in q and what the there's no one
playing apex should do away apex can't be dead there's no

1307
01:26:54,590 --> 01:26:56,990
other game alive right now

1308
01:27:02,820 --> 01:27:11,070
good aim yes very nice actually this is You got a really
good drop, because you can just farm the balls.

1309
01:27:12,330 --> 01:27:14,930
Until another solo pushes you.

1310
01:27:16,570 --> 01:27:18,870
Yeah, there's someone closing that compound.

1311
01:27:19,570 --> 01:27:21,370
I'm scared of just getting ratted on.

1312
01:27:21,930 --> 01:27:22,070
Scary.

1313
01:27:22,550 --> 01:27:24,110
Yeah, solo is, like, super paranoia.

1314
01:27:24,130 --> 01:27:25,670
That's the scariest thing with Zelda.

1315
01:27:26,130 --> 01:27:26,430
Yeah.

1316
01:27:27,770 --> 01:27:29,410
Dude, it's a fucking horror game.

1317
01:27:30,750 --> 01:27:31,330
It is.

1318
01:27:31,390 --> 01:27:31,950
Yeah, it is.

1319
01:27:32,570 --> 01:27:34,010
It's just so quiet.

1320
01:27:34,370 --> 01:27:34,810
Yeah.

1321
01:27:35,350 --> 01:27:37,690
At least you don't want armor anymore, because, like, that's
just instant.

1322
01:27:37,710 --> 01:27:40,590
to death as a solo yeah

1323
01:27:43,780 --> 01:27:58,020
get another phase driver they're for sure the ratting in
that how the did like you how the did like you have found

1324
01:27:58,020 --> 01:28:06,540
them anyway what the did they did did you think he actually
ran at at where the the team owners like drop spot was and

1325
01:28:06,540 --> 01:28:16,200
just to kill yeah i mean yeah they had yeah because i was
like how the did he died so fast it just walked he got like

1326
01:28:16,200 --> 01:28:24,820
one gun and he's just like i'm ready to i'm ready to take
his i'm gonna take his loot he must have had a good landing

1327
01:28:24,820 --> 01:28:34,870
spot if they're willing to take his loot i think so i think
so oh nice

1328
01:28:42,280 --> 01:28:48,980
you're used to if you die right now you're gonna have the
same score as me, unfortunately.

1329
01:28:49,320 --> 01:28:50,420
So don't die.

1330
01:28:50,760 --> 01:28:51,840
Zero damage?

1331
01:28:52,680 --> 01:28:55,120
Our team average is here to pull down right now.

1332
01:28:55,160 --> 01:28:56,360
Our team average!

1333
01:28:57,200 --> 01:28:58,400
It's terrible!

1334
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:01,880
Let's get it.

1335
01:29:01,960 --> 01:29:03,120
Not last, guys.

1336
01:29:03,500 --> 01:29:03,980
Not last.

1337
01:29:06,520 --> 01:29:09,420
Shining shit is actually so scary.

1338
01:29:12,920 --> 01:29:14,820
I believe in you.

1339
01:29:15,540 --> 01:29:17,120
Did turbochargers drop from here?

1340
01:29:17,220 --> 01:29:24,720
I read a turbocharger is bad for the havoc in general Why
because from the I don't know I don't know a roller player

1341
01:29:24,720 --> 01:29:38,620
told me this so I don't know how How much I can build The
source is fucking invalid Uncredible sources So I can't I

1342
01:29:38,620 --> 01:29:45,160
can't uh Oh shit this guy's lurching I'm a feeling he's like
creeping up on me.

1343
01:29:45,460 --> 01:29:48,320
Oh no, I have zone You're zoned?

1344
01:29:48,460 --> 01:29:49,000
That's good!

1345
01:29:49,100 --> 01:29:50,600
You can keep farming phase!

1346
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:55,240
Hold on, I'm gonna get a position right now.

1347
01:29:55,440 --> 01:29:58,220
I'm scared we're gonna get pulled up on here.

1348
01:30:00,960 --> 01:30:01,760
I believe.

1349
01:30:06,250 --> 01:30:07,370
You're not gonna die.

1350
01:30:10,470 --> 01:30:12,190
Yeah, I'm not gonna get ratted on, right?

1351
01:30:12,210 --> 01:30:13,010
Yeah, there's no way.

1352
01:30:15,410 --> 01:30:17,750
If there's a rat, we could go beat him up, IRL.

1353
01:30:19,550 --> 01:30:20,710
They're all Japanese.

1354
01:30:21,810 --> 01:30:23,490
I am not involved in this.

1355
01:30:23,850 --> 01:30:25,550
I'm so far away.

1356
01:30:28,610 --> 01:30:29,810
You're automatically...

1357
01:30:29,810 --> 01:30:31,310
Yeah, I'm an enabler.

1358
01:30:32,910 --> 01:30:35,110
You're like, Toki gave us the idea.

1359
01:30:36,390 --> 01:30:38,970
Her NA ways told us to do it.

1360
01:30:44,490 --> 01:30:45,550
Oh my god.

1361
01:30:45,890 --> 01:30:49,530
I like how you're still farming phase because you have
nothing else to do.

1362
01:30:49,550 --> 01:31:00,870
you oh there it is there's already oh there is we're gonna
be waiting for you to fuck it yeah let's get rid of him shut

1363
01:31:00,870 --> 01:31:09,720
up it's kind of illegal

1364
01:31:17,040 --> 01:31:28,770
oh killed a rat where is he where'd you go

1365
01:31:43,360 --> 01:31:49,640
there we go this is like a horror movie right now yeah The
suspense.

1366
01:32:25,320 --> 01:32:27,500
I'm scared of getting shot on the side.

1367
01:32:28,340 --> 01:32:30,360
Yeah, because you don't know where the other teeth players
are.

1368
01:32:35,170 --> 01:32:36,630
Can I fight this?

1369
01:32:36,770 --> 01:32:37,970
Because I was getting third party.

1370
01:32:44,850 --> 01:32:46,550
Bro, no mate, he did that.

1371
01:32:49,750 --> 01:32:51,270
We're either doing the same as that shit.

1372
01:32:52,110 --> 01:32:54,030
Yeah, we're like doing the same thing.

1373
01:33:00,420 --> 01:33:01,760
and watching this.

1374
01:33:01,980 --> 01:33:06,960
I have the most chance of getting third party.

1375
01:33:21,130 --> 01:33:22,050
Wait, did he move?

1376
01:33:23,590 --> 01:33:26,110
Yeah, he moved to this building.

1377
01:33:26,270 --> 01:33:26,710
I don't know.

1378
01:33:35,990 --> 01:33:37,610
I lose that fight.

1379
01:33:37,770 --> 01:33:40,210
He has a little nemesis.

1380
01:33:40,430 --> 01:33:41,250
I have a havoc.

1381
01:33:42,810 --> 01:33:43,630
I gotta charge me.

1382
01:33:44,410 --> 01:33:46,570
Yeah, he has the ping diff too.

1383
01:33:47,170 --> 01:33:51,650
I mean, you're both in JP though, but he has more shots into
you.

1384
01:34:00,720 --> 01:34:02,100
I guess you could just chill.

1385
01:34:02,560 --> 01:34:03,200
He's not in there though.

1386
01:34:06,220 --> 01:34:07,260
Yeah, 100%.

1387
01:34:07,260 --> 01:34:07,820
Are you fighting?

1388
01:34:13,500 --> 01:34:15,400
Oh, oh, Tony has died.

1389
01:34:15,740 --> 01:34:16,600
Okay, we just killed.

1390
01:34:17,480 --> 01:34:20,580
With the repeater in solos, what the fuck?

1391
01:34:20,580 --> 01:34:30,680
that's that guy is so confident i'm not gonna lie yeah that
is so confident he's so confident no one's gonna fucking get

01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:12,680
Okay, what do I do?

1480
01:45:13,280 --> 01:45:14,560
Okay, Blood Valk.

1481
01:45:15,640 --> 01:45:15,980
Okay.

1482
01:45:16,160 --> 01:45:20,720
I feel like we got to stick together because like, I feel
like if we're separated, they're going to pick us off so

1483
01:45:20,720 --> 01:45:21,220
fast.

1484
01:45:21,500 --> 01:45:23,200
Yeah, I'm a stupid person.

1485
01:45:23,380 --> 01:45:24,060
That is a good strat.

1486
01:45:24,400 --> 01:45:28,060
That I have, that's revolutionary stuff.

1487
01:45:28,520 --> 01:45:30,060
Yeah, yeah, we just got to stick together.

1488
01:45:30,120 --> 01:45:33,080
so we don't individually get picked up.

1489
01:45:34,820 --> 01:45:38,200
We just gotta make sure we have blue armor by the time
someone rolls up on us.

1490
01:45:39,720 --> 01:45:40,500
That's true, that's true.

1491
01:45:41,600 --> 01:45:42,340
I mean, like, you just...

1492
01:45:42,340 --> 01:45:43,080
Look at the sky.

1493
01:45:43,560 --> 01:45:45,380
You just got, like, super lucky with a zone, too.

1494
01:45:45,500 --> 01:45:46,980
It, like, literally pulled onto him.

1495
01:45:48,640 --> 01:45:49,940
I might be honest with you.

1496
01:45:50,040 --> 01:45:52,100
I actually hate having zones in solo.

1497
01:45:52,420 --> 01:45:52,420
Wait.

1498
01:45:52,640 --> 01:45:55,040
Oh, I guess, like, solo is a scarier, yeah.

1499
01:45:55,220 --> 01:45:56,440
Because you can't just walk up.

1500
01:45:56,440 --> 01:45:57,180
Yeah, yeah.

1501
01:45:57,180 --> 01:45:58,460
You can't walk up to people.

1502
01:45:58,600 --> 01:45:59,620
You have to actually...

1503
01:46:00,120 --> 01:46:10,100
you have to actually like look around i'm the one that get
walked yeah yeah i get that yeah okay it's okay if we have

1504
01:46:10,100 --> 01:46:16,100

1508
01:46:34,620 --> 01:46:40,340

01:53:47,120 --> 01:53:47,920
Yeah, no, uh...

1628
01:53:47,920 --> 01:53:48,860
Nah, yeah.

1629
01:53:49,120 --> 01:53:50,800
I think Val can't, right?

1630
01:53:51,300 --> 01:53:51,940
I don't remember Val.

1631
01:53:52,220 --> 01:53:52,400
No, I can't.

1632
01:53:53,060 --> 01:53:55,540
Yeah, because I don't play Val, so I don't know Val can.

1633
01:53:56,560 --> 01:53:58,600
I did the phase again.

1634
01:54:00,120 --> 01:54:01,460
Just look at cheeky stream.

1635
01:54:04,460 --> 01:54:05,920
It's a joke!

1636
01:54:06,760 --> 01:54:09,220
It's a joke, but it was a joke.

1637
01:54:10,260 --> 01:54:12,780
Turning off echo cancellation.

1638
01:54:13,640 --> 01:54:14,220
Echo cancellation.

1639
01:54:16,160 --> 01:54:16,560
I hear a car.

1640
01:54:16,700 --> 01:54:17,080

01:55:18,320 --> 01:55:22,080

01:55:44,640 --> 01:55:48,120
Oh, they're People over there.

1662
01:55:48,600 --> 01:55:50,660
I have alt who need to fly.

01:55:51,380 --> 01:55:52,600
I'm just gonna scan just in case.

1664
01:55:52,620 --> 01:55:54,700
If they start fighting, you can third party there.

1665
01:55:55,080 --> 01:55:57,020
But if they don't commit, you don't have.

1666
01:55:57,240 --> 01:55:57,900
They're not committing.

1667
01:55:58,000 --> 01:55:58,920
There's a team right here.

1668
01:55:59,020 --> 01:55:59,980
There's a team here.

1669
01:56:00,720 --> 01:56:02,060
And there's a team to my right.

1670
01:56:02,460 --> 01:56:04,440
I'm like worried I'm getting a shot from her back, so.

1671
01:56:07,740 --> 01:56:08,740
I don't see them.

1672
01:56:11,740 --> 01:56:12,800
Where were they getting shooting?

1673
01:56:14,140 --> 01:56:14,800
Are you guys talking?

1674
01:56:14,860 --> 01:56:21,260
Did my Discord, my Discord crowd- I think I'm like higher
central.

1675
01:56:21,500 --> 01:56:21,940
What's going on?

1676
01:56:23,300 --> 01:56:24,720
Guys, what's going on guys?

1677
01:56:24,960 --> 01:56:25,920
What's going on guys?

1678
01:56:26,660 --> 01:56:27,920
Everything's going right.

1679
01:56:29,940 --> 01:56:30,800
We can fly.

1680
01:56:31,280 --> 01:56:31,900
Look at the zone.

1681
01:56:32,380 --> 01:56:32,880
Where's the zone?

1682
01:56:33,120 --> 01:56:34,600
The zone is a grow tower.

1683
01:56:34,860 --> 01:56:35,700
A grow tower.

1684
01:56:37,060 --> 01:56:38,200
Here you go.

1685
01:56:38,500 --> 01:56:39,380
Is there a team on solar?

1686
01:56:40,480 --> 01:56:41,540
Yeah, there's one party.

1687
01:56:43,080 --> 01:56:45,860
Look at how they're like what they're doing.

1688
01:56:47,580 --> 01:56:49,020
They're not scanning the beacon.

1689
01:56:49,200 --> 01:56:50,700
I don't know if they have beacon characters.

1690
01:56:52,640 --> 01:56:53,480
That's the thing.

1691
01:56:54,800 --> 01:56:57,780
I think you guys take solar from them if they're not there
anymore.

1692
01:56:59,020 --> 01:56:59,180
Okay.

1693
01:56:59,620 --> 01:57:01,420
We don't know if they are though, so...

1694
01:57:02,880 --> 01:57:06,340
Yeah, walk up from the right and then scan them.

1695
01:57:06,660 --> 01:57:06,920
Okay.

1696
01:57:08,500 --> 01:57:09,520
Let's go right side.

1697
01:57:09,820 --> 01:57:10,960
I believe in us.

1698
01:57:13,900 --> 01:57:14,940
Let's play for that beacon.

1699
01:57:15,140 --> 01:57:17,040
You can even like tank a little bit of zone as well.

1700
01:57:19,240 --> 01:57:28,360
it one minute okay oh my god they knocked somebody they're
in front of us and from us in front of us they scan you see

01:57:33,120 --> 01:57:36,040

01:57:59,200 --> 01:58:06,410

1704
01:58:34,820 --> 01:58:39,100

1706
01:59:07,180 --> 01:59:08,780
You creeped them.

1707
01:59:10,220 --> 01:59:12,540
Bro, I can't believe.

1708
01:59:13,360 --> 01:59:16,360
Ever since Taya crashed, everything went downhill.

1709
01:59:16,700 --> 01:59:17,980
It's a great hit.

1710
01:59:18,680 --> 01:59:20,760
It hit all of us.

1711
01:59:22,520 --> 01:59:23,800
Oh, shit.

1712
01:59:25,940 --> 01:59:27,220
Oh my god.

1713
01:59:27,800 --> 01:59:28,380
Almost.

1714
01:59:28,860 --> 01:59:29,740
I can't believe it.

1715
01:59:29,740 --> 01:59:31,980
Bro, you actually used the peacekeeper like ash.

1716
01:59:32,120 --> 01:59:33,080
That is crazy.

1717
01:59:33,800 --> 01:59:36,580
Yeah, bro, you should just, you should just play it.

1718
01:59:36,600 --> 01:59:38,320
This is hard scope.

1719
01:59:38,660 --> 01:59:40,380
He has a hard scope, yeah.

1720
01:59:40,840 --> 01:59:42,320
He has an ash hard scope.

1721
01:59:44,940 --> 01:59:46,020
Oh my god.

1722
01:59:47,820 --> 01:59:48,720
That's so unlucky.

1723
01:59:49,080 --> 01:59:50,800
We're trying to fuck over a solo, man.

1724
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:53,480
Nah, that is so fucking unlucky, man.

1725
01:59:53,940 --> 01:59:54,220
I know.

1726
01:59:54,900 --> 01:59:56,040
In duels.

1727
01:59:56,500 --> 02:00:02,360
I've never, I've only had, this is the second blue stream
I've ever had on Apex.

1728
02:00:02,360 --> 02:00:03,500
It had to happen now.

1729
02:00:03,500 --> 02:00:06,360
It had to happen in the duels.

1730
02:00:06,600 --> 02:00:07,280
Yeah.

1731
02:00:07,320 --> 02:00:07,560
Yeah.

1732
02:00:09,060 --> 02:00:11,220
That's actually crazy.

1733
02:00:11,580 --> 02:00:15,600
My second ever, ever blue screen of death.

1734
02:00:17,060 --> 02:00:18,780
It was the jinks, the Taya jinks.

1735
02:00:19,500 --> 02:00:20,120
I'm sorry.

1736
02:00:20,860 --> 02:00:23,340
It's the next stop is Yuri's, unfortunately.

Yeah.

1738
02:00:24,920 --> 02:00:27,580
No, Yuri's already got hit with the fucking Discord.

1739
02:00:28,420 --> 02:00:29,020
Not me.

1740
02:00:29,020 --> 02:00:30,360

288!

1751
02:01:16,220 --> 02:01:21,540
This game wanted him to have a higher average so they
fucking sent out the assassins on me.

1752
02:01:24,720 --> 02:01:27,700
In the middle of the road, Tate 2.

1753

I was like, what the fuck?

1754
02:01:32,580 --> 02:01:34,040
That's so messed up.

1755
02:01:35,180 --> 02:01:36,580
Maybe we're just meant to be overwatched.

1756
02:01:36,600 --> 02:01:50,560
players yeah yeah this game is just telling us we suck ass

Oh my god It's okay, gold is like the average Average player
You're average That's the average race I'm average I just

1769
02:03:50,020 --> 02:04:01,020

1770
02:04:01,020 --> 02:04:09,700

actually i think i have a mercy pocket i'm about to duo it a

1771
02:04:09,700 --> 02:04:19,260
friend dude we're about to roll true we're about to get the
diamond you see the mercy pocket this is that's it that the

1772
02:04:19,260 --> 02:04:27,880
healer pocket that that's that's the way the oh my god this
team oh this team yeah holy oh my god that's team that

1773
02:04:27,880 --> 02:04:33,320
killed you no because they died it's the team that killed
the people that killed me

1774
02:04:36,600 --> 02:04:46,120
and they see the best yeah the second to the best yeah
someone my chat was like every gold player say they belong

1775
02:04:46,120 --> 02:05:00,180
in diamond dude my gym coach says the same shit like i'm in
gold but like i deserve diamond bro my teammates like the

1776
02:05:00,180 --> 02:05:11,160
moment you get that mercy pocket you go up yeah i feel like
moments where you cannot do like you can't do more as a solo

1777
02:05:11,160 --> 02:05:11,580
though.

1778
02:05:12,020 --> 02:05:20,200
Well to be fair I think like Overwatch has changed because
in the past you can solo carry a team in the past when there

1779
02:05:20,200 --> 02:05:21,200
was like six players.

1780
02:05:21,900 --> 02:05:29,020
Now like now the way they balanced in Overwatch 2 I feel
like it's harder to solo carry if you're like a fucking god

1781
02:05:29,020 --> 02:05:29,880
tier DPS.

1782
02:05:30,880 --> 02:05:32,360
Yeah it's just you just die.

1783
02:05:32,800 --> 02:05:32,960
Yeah.

1784
02:05:33,300 --> 02:05:33,980
You just die.

1785
02:05:34,100 --> 02:05:35,260
Especially if you're a DPS player.

1786
02:05:35,340 --> 02:05:42,220
If you really want to class being a tank okay tank is
playing tank is fucking miserable but like no one really

1787
02:05:42,220 --> 02:05:50,260
enjoys playing tank but like take is like the most

02:06:59,100 --> 02:06:59,720
Go to firing range.

1811
02:07:00,680 --> 02:07:01,700
Go to firing range.

1812
02:07:03,260 --> 02:07:03,540
Yeah.

1813
02:07:03,980 --> 02:07:04,180
Yeah.

1814
02:07:04,400 --> 02:07:04,780
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1815
02:07:06,460 --> 02:07:07,180
We need to go in.

1816
02:07:07,320 --> 02:07:09,140
And then we have to leave because it resets it.

1817
02:07:10,080 --> 02:07:10,160
Okay.

1818
02:07:10,280 --> 02:07:13,340
Yeah, it's a little, it's a little ALGS strat there.

1819
02:07:15,180 --> 02:07:19,160
I'm not too versed in the apex, apex phenomenon.

1820
02:07:19,480 --> 02:07:23,200
Yeah, we've learned to, we've learned to adapt to the bugs.

1821
02:07:23,620 --> 02:07:24,460
It's not bugs anymore.

1822
02:07:24,660 --> 02:07:26,920
It's like how in Overwatch you turn on Vsync on.

1823
02:07:26,940 --> 02:07:33,480
on and off that that's the i don't even think that we're
dude punch boosting is definitely back holy yeah i'm pretty

1824
02:07:33,480 --> 02:07:40,200
sure it's back oh man like you know how were you you played
overwatch since launch right tyo yeah yeah do you remember

1825
02:07:40,200 --> 02:07:46,820
that that that phase where you have to delete your friends
for more fps you remember that oh yeah that was just funny

1826
02:07:46,820 --> 02:07:55,620
any friends in your friends list yeah yeah you have to like
keep your friends list to like like one to two pages because

1827
02:07:55,620 --> 02:08:01,840
you can get more frames so people had to do that over one
yeah you have too many friends you're getting fucking nerfed

1828
02:08:01,840 --> 02:08:12,460
yeah you're like are you a good enough friend to like in to
for the frames okay that was so dumb yeah yeah we go back to

1829
02:08:12,460 --> 02:08:18,340
lobby and then and then you race crashes right that's the
whole plan yeah yeah he's gonna crash the next game wait not

1830
02:08:18,340 --> 02:08:27,780
trios lockdown okay wait he's so oh okay it's good yeah it's
good now i thought it was so bug Yeah, frames were for

1831
02:08:27,780 --> 02:08:29,260
friends, 100%.

1832
02:08:33,720 --> 02:08:40,500
To be fair, even if like, you know, Overwatch 2 has gone
through a lot of things, the best thing about Overwatch is

1833
02:08:40,500 --> 02:08:43,740
the fact that you literally play any server and you're fine.

1834
02:08:44,460 --> 02:08:47,020
The net code for this fucking game is like insane.

1835
02:08:49,280 --> 02:08:50,940
It's one good thing, I guess.

1836
02:08:51,100 --> 02:08:51,400
Yeah.

1837
02:08:53,260 --> 02:08:54,800
Out of the many bad.

1838
02:08:54,880 --> 02:08:56,940
Out of the many bad.

1839
02:08:57,240 --> 02:08:59,220
But then again, any game, no game is.

1840
02:08:59,240 --> 02:09:07,540
perfect honestly yeah yeah yeah 100 i just wish there would
be a new fps game i've been like there's like this uh i

Not even that new rank they made.

1859
02:10:50,960 --> 02:10:51,900
What's that new rank they made?

1860
02:10:51,900 --> 02:10:54,580
There's like 10 people in that ring.

1861
02:10:54,940 --> 02:10:55,660
Like, champion.

1862
02:10:55,860 --> 02:10:56,260

Wait, really?

1868
02:11:04,220 --> 02:11:06,960
I thought Champion was like not top 500.

1869
02:11:07,380 --> 02:11:09,100
It's like the tier above, a tier.

1870
02:11:09,260 --> 02:11:12,880
No, like top 500 is like from Masters 1.

1871
02:11:13,560 --> 02:11:14,020
Oh!

1872
02:11:15,380 --> 02:11:19,820
Bro, that means Champion is like fucking top 10 or top 15.

1873
02:11:20,020 --> 02:11:24,100
Yeah, it's like, it's really like, I don't know, I'm never

We have cover here.

2301
02:37:46,420 --> 02:37:47,040
Lots of fucking cover.

2302
02:37:47,100 --> 02:37:48,060
The steam can't walk up.

2303
02:37:48,100 --> 02:37:50,720
Like, the steam can't walk up because they're just going to
get shot by the steam.

2304
02:37:51,000 --> 02:37:52,000
I'm looking at this team right now.

2305
02:37:52,000 --> 02:37:54,200
Take a face now since they saw us already anyways.

2310
02:37:57,920 --> 02:37:59,420

2320
02:38:19,180 --> 02:38:20,220
Is there a...

2321
02:38:20,220 --> 02:38:22,700
Can you like move up on the left side somehow?

2322
02:38:23,080 --> 02:38:23,620
Is there like a cover?

2323
02:38:23,620 --> 02:38:24,120
We a zone.

2324
02:38:24,280 --> 02:38:25,380
No, I don't think so.

2325
02:38:26,080 --> 02:38:27,260
The cover's not going to best.

2326
02:38:27,560 --> 02:38:28,360
I'm going to stay to the right.

2327
02:38:28,440 --> 02:38:29,360
Oh, they're rocketing us.

2328
02:38:29,700 --> 02:38:30,060
No, no, there's no cover.

2329
02:38:30,160 --> 02:38:30,580
No, no, I was looking.

2330
02:38:30,780 --> 02:38:31,400
Yeah, there's no cover.

2331
02:38:31,640 --> 02:38:32,500
Let me just play it here.

2332
02:38:33,020 --> 02:38:34,060
All right, we can fly too.

2333
02:38:34,320 --> 02:38:34,680
This...

2334
02:38:34,680 --> 02:38:35,220
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2335
02:38:35,620 --> 02:38:36,900
We haven't read the play as well.

2336
02:38:37,080 --> 02:38:37,320
Oh.

2337
02:38:39,220 --> 02:38:39,580

What the fuck?

2347
02:38:51,060 --> 02:38:52,840

They're above.

2427
02:41:59,850 --> 02:42:00,990
What is that corner?

02:42:01,550 --> 02:42:02,550
That is an insane corner.

2429
02:42:02,750 --> 02:42:03,590
I think they're gonna drop.

2430
02:42:04,050 --> 02:42:07,330
Um, if this team drops, we played, we played behind right
here.

2431

2432
02:42:11,590 --> 02:42:12,290
They can't get in.

2433
02:42:12,510 --> 02:42:14,450
Throw your, like, thermalising knees as well.

2434
02:42:14,990 --> 02:42:15,590

2629
02:50:30,460 --> 02:50:37,860
okay the next match will not have kill point limit oh he's

2632
02:50:55,260 --> 02:50:56,880

02:51:12,170 --> 02:51:12,450
There's two.

2637
02:51:12,970 --> 02:51:14,090
There's a ring console.

2638
02:51:14,550 --> 02:51:16,310
There's the ring, and then there's the beacon.

2639
02:51:17,630 --> 02:51:17,790
Okay.

2640
02:51:18,830 --> 02:51:19,230
Yeah.

02:51:19,590 --> 02:51:21,470
So it's like map room scan and ring scan.

2642
02:51:21,810 --> 02:51:23,430
We just don't have the character for map room.

2643
02:51:23,970 --> 02:51:24,470
Or not map room.

2644
02:51:24,550 --> 02:51:25,670
We don't have the character for ring.

2645
02:51:27,590 --> 02:51:29,590
So we just But we know where everyone else is going.

2646
02:51:29,950 --> 02:51:31,570

03:03:28,270 --> 03:03:29,490

Not pushing it.

2814
03:03:53,410 --> 03:03:57,910
If we fight this, we can't get knocked, since we're just
going to get pushed by this team as well.

2815
03:03:58,230 --> 03:04:03,370
We kind of have to fight from like a little more upfront so
we don't get...

2816
03:04:03,370 --> 03:04:04,710
Looks like they're rotating.

2817
03:04:04,810 --> 03:04:05,950
They're getting shot from other people.

2818
03:04:06,710 --> 03:04:07,750
I can scan the three.

2819
03:04:08,310 --> 03:04:11,590
Oh, they're on top of the thing.

2822
03:04:14,610 --> 03:04:15,430

2823
03:04:15,750 --> 03:04:16,350
They start fighting.

2824
03:04:16,830 --> 03:04:17,750
Someone needs to watch that.

2825
03:04:17,770 --> 03:04:18,990

03:04:27,130 --> 03:04:27,930
He's behind that rock.

2834
03:04:28,150 --> 03:04:29,070
The team's behind that rock.

2835
03:04:29,210 --> 03:04:29,830
I'm watching them.

2836
03:04:30,050 --> 03:04:30,870

2837
03:04:31,810 --> 03:04:32,710
He's still down again.

2838
03:04:32,850 --> 03:04:34,430

2839
03:04:38,660 --> 03:04:39,560
They're still there.

2840
03:04:40,740 --> 03:04:41,000

Okay, I'm batting.

2844
03:04:44,600 --> 03:04:45,600
I expected them to shoot.

2845
03:04:45,840 --> 03:04:46,480
35 purple.

2846
03:04:47,200 --> 03:04:47,940
Crack the bang.

2847
03:04:48,280 --> 03:04:51,080
Oh, they're a purple armor now, the people under here.

2848
03:04:52,060 --> 03:04:53,100
No one in this.

2849
03:04:54,320 --> 03:04:56,460
I only have one bat, so I'm not going to poke too much.

2850
03:04:57,240 --> 03:04:58,100
How many cells do you have?

2851
03:04:58,100 --> 03:04:58,580
Okay, okay.

2852

03:04:59,280 --> 03:04:59,440
I'm good.

2854
03:04:59,520 --> 03:05:01,020
This team shouldn't go for us.

2855
03:05:01,100 --> 03:05:04,620
Like, they should just, like, stay on their side, this team.

2856
03:05:05,000 --> 03:05:06,360
We're going to play for a Valholt here.

2857
03:05:06,500 --> 03:05:06,700
Okay.

2858
03:05:07,020 --> 03:05:10,780

03:19:17,620 --> 03:19:19,880
Damage boost, Tim, as Mercy.

3112
03:19:20,120 --> 03:19:21,100
Tio on Mercy.

3113
03:19:22,120 --> 03:19:23,600
Your support's like gold, right?

3114
03:19:24,260 --> 03:19:25,460
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3115
03:19:25,800 --> 03:19:29,120
Yeah, you just play Mercy and damage boost your ease.

3116
03:19:29,740 --> 03:19:31,080
Yeah, boost him.

3117
03:19:31,240 --> 03:19:31,880
Yeah, yeah.

3118
03:19:32,200 --> 03:19:32,940
Yeah, boost him.

3119
03:19:33,140 --> 03:19:33,760
Damage boost.

3120
03:19:34,680 --> 03:19:35,640
By damage boost.

3121
03:19:35,940 --> 03:19:38,300
For legal reasons, I meant damage boost.

3122
03:19:38,620 --> 03:19:40,060
Not anything else.

3123
03:19:40,460 --> 03:19:41,320
Not anything.

3124
03:19:41,360 --> 03:19:43,740
I don't even know anything else but damage boost.

3125
03:19:43,780 --> 03:19:44,600
Yeah, exactly.

3126
03:19:44,780 --> 03:19:45,440
You don't need heals.

3127
03:19:45,600 --> 03:19:48,120
A true Mercy player knows it's all about damage boosting.

3128
03:19:48,700 --> 03:19:49,100
Yeah.

3129
03:19:49,280 --> 03:19:49,540
Yeah.

3130
03:19:49,680 --> 03:19:51,980
But he doesn't need heals if he kills everybody.

3131
03:19:52,120 --> 03:19:54,160
He has, yeah, they have regen now.

3132
03:19:54,360 --> 03:19:55,380
Overwatch players can eat regen.

3133
03:19:56,240 --> 03:19:57,660
Yeah, like, you don't even need heals.

3134
03:19:58,120 --> 03:19:59,080
Yeah, you don't even have...

3135
03:19:59,080 --> 03:20:01,380
Wait, was that not a thing before?

3136
03:20:01,660 --> 03:20:03,820
No, yeah, no, it was only...

3137
03:20:03,820 --> 03:20:05,740
Like, before then, there was no regen.

3138
03:20:06,140 --> 03:20:06,880
There was only support players.

3139
03:20:07,140 --> 03:20:11,280
Yeah, and then they added support, and then they're like,
everybody gets regen.

3140
03:20:14,260 --> 03:20:15,180
Oh, shit.

3141
03:20:16,140 --> 03:20:17,740
Yeah, so don't worry.

3142
03:20:18,340 --> 03:20:19,320
You don't need heals.

3143
03:20:19,480 --> 03:20:20,800
You just wait for your regen.

03:22:36,940 --> 03:22:40,080
Just as long as I can do it before my streams, that's really
good.

3164
03:22:40,320 --> 03:22:40,920
