No.

690
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:43,920
They shot me.

691
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:47,020
I was going to die.

692
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,120
Don't die.

693
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:53,880
I'm still alive.

694
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:54,700
I'm still alive.

695
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:58,020
Okay, this is why Uto is the pro player.

696
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,180

She pro.

701
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:12,260
This is how she got rank one in season seven.

702
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:15,740
Oh, Rez?

703
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:16,160

00:45:58,340 --> 00:45:59,860
I don't know if we can climb up.

1065
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:01,120
I don't know if that's smart.

1066
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:02,680
I don't think- Yeah!

This time.

1080
00:46:58,090 --> 00:47:01,910
We were just trying to find the best team comp.

00:47:02,530 --> 00:47:02,830
You know?

1082
00:47:03,310 --> 00:47:06,070
We don't know what the best team comp is.

1083
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:06,830
All right.

1084
00:47:06,930 --> 00:47:07,950

Her aura is still good, I think.

1093
00:47:21,330 --> 00:47:23,730

Okay.

00:55:50,890 --> 00:55:53,710
Uh, careful behind us.

Okay, um, I'm gonna go forward, Paul.

1261
00:55:57,670 --> 00:55:58,530
Hi, guys, Pandy.

00:55:59,070 --> 00:56:00,370
Yeah, pretty scary.

1263
00:56:00,770 --> 00:56:01,090
Okay.

1264
00:56:02,890 --> 00:56:03,990
Let's see, team.

1265
00:56:06,330 --> 00:56:07,010
Scary.

1266
00:56:08,830 --> 00:56:09,930
Yeah, I might die.

1267
00:56:10,210 --> 00:56:11,110
I might do something stupid.

1268
00:56:13,530 --> 00:56:14,870
Finally, I get blue.

1269
00:56:16,190 --> 00:56:16,870
That's fine.

1270
00:56:19,170 --> 00:56:23,350
I-I-I want to fight the team behind us.

1271
00:56:23,710 --> 00:56:25,790
Oh, they're like all the way.

1272
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:28,730
I think we should get a crack first.

1273
00:56:28,990 --> 00:56:29,570
Because they're...

1274
00:56:29,570 --> 00:56:30,470
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1275
00:56:30,710 --> 00:56:34,490
This team is so annoying, though.

1276
00:56:34,530 --> 00:56:35,450
I'm burning one.

1277
00:56:35,650 --> 00:56:35,730

Yeah, I need chill.

1281
00:56:41,170 --> 00:56:42,070
We're so poor.

1282
00:56:42,910 --> 00:56:45,210
Okay, I- Okay, I can't give you one.

1283
00:56:46,190 --> 00:56:47,670
We're so poor.

1284
00:56:48,410 --> 00:56:51,730
That team is still white, white armor.

1285
00:56:52,070 --> 00:56:53,530
Leave us alone!

1286
00:56:55,330 --> 00:56:57,970
I'm gonna waste my heals.

1287
00:56:58,930 --> 00:57:00,190
Okay, I'll use my battery.

1288
00:57:00,550 --> 00:57:00,990
Oh, okay.

1289
00:57:01,790 --> 00:57:02,030

Okay.

2113
01:35:26,970 --> 01:35:29,770
If I die, I might die.

2114
01:35:30,230 --> 01:35:31,750
If you die, I...

2115
01:35:31,750 --> 01:35:32,130

You clutch, remember.

01:35:38,630 --> 01:35:40,310
If I die, it will crash.

2121
01:35:40,830 --> 01:35:41,290
Yeah, yeah.

2122
01:35:42,210 --> 01:35:42,730

01:36:08,160 --> 01:36:08,680
Whoa!

2133
01:36:09,280 --> 01:36:10,200
Okay, I'm backing out a little.

2134
01:36:10,280 --> 01:36:11,120
I'm backing out.

2135
01:36:12,140 --> 01:36:13,680
Careful, they might grapple.

2136
01:36:13,820 --> 01:36:14,240
They might zip.

2137
01:36:14,400 --> 01:36:14,660
Careful.

2138
01:36:15,520 --> 01:36:16,040
Okay.

2141
01:36:24,280 --> 01:36:26,020
Oh wait, sorry, I missed.

2142
01:36:28,180 --> 01:36:28,840
Oh, careful.

01:36:33,030 --> 01:36:33,350
Scan.

2144
01:36:35,030 --> 01:36:35,690
Nice scan.

2145
01:36:36,250 --> 01:36:38,290
Maybe one guy might be so close to us.

2146
01:36:40,250 --> 01:36:41,090
Be careful, be careful.

2147
01:36:42,570 --> 01:36:43,410
I need a shield cell.

2148
01:36:46,030 --> 01:36:47,530

2149
01:36:48,670 --> 01:36:49,670

2156
01:36:57,070 --> 01:36:57,670
Scan, scan.

2157
01:36:57,810 --> 01:36:59,390
Heal, heal, Luto.

2158
01:37:00,350 --> 01:37:00,950
Under, under, under.

2159
01:37:01,150 --> 01:37:02,530
I knock one, I knock one, I knock one.

2160
01:37:02,670 --> 01:37:03,270
Okay, I'm coming over.

2161
01:37:03,310 --> 01:37:04,250

01:37:08,630 --> 01:37:09,430
I need help though.

2165
01:37:10,130 --> 01:37:11,050
I'm bad, I'm stealing.

2166
01:37:11,430 --> 01:37:11,970
Oh, no.

2167
01:37:12,470 --> 01:37:13,470
Oh, so low, so low.

2168
01:37:13,550 --> 01:37:14,590
I can't, I can't.

2169
01:37:14,930 --> 01:37:16,490
Oh, another team, another team.

2170
01:37:17,350 --> 01:37:17,750
Another team?

2171
01:37:17,770 --> 01:37:18,590
Okay, I'm backing him back.

2172
01:37:19,470 --> 01:37:19,990
Yeah.

2173
01:37:20,930 --> 01:37:21,970
Careful here.

2174
01:37:22,230 --> 01:37:23,950
Behind, um, in front of you.

2175
01:37:24,110 --> 01:37:25,630
Yeah, this is bad.

2176
01:37:25,630 --> 01:37:25,890
Yeah.

2177
01:37:36,680 --> 01:37:38,320
Can't be out of here.

2178
01:37:39,520 --> 01:37:39,920
Okay, here.

2179
01:37:40,180 --> 01:37:40,580
Be nice.

2180
01:37:40,780 --> 01:37:43,640
Oh, I'm gonna start off, you guys.

2181
01:37:44,800 --> 01:37:44,920
Yeah.

2182
01:37:45,180 --> 01:37:47,000
There's no point in fighting this.

2183
01:37:48,560 --> 01:37:49,660
Oh, someone kill me!

2184
01:37:51,480 --> 01:37:53,140

There's no one!

2187
01:37:56,600 --> 01:37:57,920
Crawl to them!

2188
01:37:58,200 --> 01:37:58,460

2191
01:38:01,100 --> 01:38:02,060
Crawl to them!

2192
01:38:02,580 --> 01:38:05,140
I can't craft you if you're still alive!

2193

2194
01:38:07,720 --> 01:38:07,800

Okay, I will go to you.

01:38:13,560 --> 01:38:14,080
I will go to you.

2201
01:38:14,340 --> 01:38:17,640
I can't craft because you're still alive!

2202
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:19,520
Oh!

01:38:20,140 --> 01:38:21,380

I almost die.

2211
01:38:28,740 --> 01:38:29,260
I almost die.

2212
01:38:29,560 --> 01:38:29,740
I almost die.

2213
01:38:29,880 --> 01:38:30,420
Wait, wait.

2214
01:38:30,420 --> 01:38:31,280
Wait for this time.

2215
01:38:31,480 --> 01:38:31,740

2217
01:38:32,840 --> 01:38:34,420
Dino, crawl to them right now.

2218
01:38:35,060 --> 01:38:35,540
Okay.

2219
01:38:35,980 --> 01:38:36,320
Okay.

2220
01:38:37,220 --> 01:38:38,160
Wait, wait.

2221
01:38:38,640 --> 01:38:39,640
I'm gonna die soon.

2222
01:38:40,160 --> 01:38:40,960
Okay, I'm dying.

2223
01:38:41,400 --> 01:38:41,620
I'm dying.

2224
01:38:41,680 --> 01:38:41,880
I'm dying.

2225
01:38:41,880 --> 01:38:42,080
Are you dead?

2226
01:38:42,220 --> 01:38:42,460
I'm dying.

2227
01:38:42,580 --> 01:38:42,840
Okay.

Okay.

2230
01:38:47,520 --> 01:38:49,520
Dino, why did you die faster?

2231
01:38:51,120 --> 01:38:52,160
Oh, sorry.

2232
01:38:54,840 --> 01:38:56,820
Okay, I'm resting here.

2233
01:38:59,020 --> 01:39:02,460
We're late here and we go, um, if I say this, okay.

2234
01:39:06,480 --> 01:39:08,660
Why did no one kill you?

2235
01:39:10,300 --> 01:39:11,820
They don't kill me.

2236
01:39:12,060 --> 01:39:13,520
No one wanted to kill you.

2237
01:39:13,740 --> 01:39:14,300
You were alive.

2238
01:39:15,360 --> 01:39:16,700
You were alive for too long.

2239
01:39:17,420 --> 01:39:18,360
Oh my god.

2240
01:39:18,900 --> 01:39:19,940
Maybe I'm too useless.

2241
01:39:20,140 --> 01:39:21,580
There's no one gonna kill me.

2242
01:39:22,500 --> 01:39:24,280
They feel so sorry for you.

2243
01:39:24,340 --> 01:39:25,660
They didn't want to kill you.

2244
01:39:26,480 --> 01:39:29,200
They're like, no, this- it's too sad.

Maybe he's...

2308
01:42:49,470 --> 01:42:50,650
I think he was trying to rest.

2309
01:42:50,870 --> 01:42:51,770
I think he wanted to rest.

2310
01:42:52,790 --> 01:42:53,750
That's really it.

2311
01:42:54,850 --> 01:42:55,450
Alright, nice.

2312
01:42:55,570 --> 01:42:56,870
I have zero touch.

2313
01:42:57,510 --> 01:42:58,470
We gotta go zone.

2314
01:42:59,670 --> 01:43:00,470
Let's go.

2315
01:43:00,630 --> 01:43:02,050
We're so poor.

2316
01:43:04,050 --> 01:43:04,850
No ammo.

2317
01:43:08,650 --> 01:43:08,910
Heavy.

2318
01:43:09,630 --> 01:43:10,270
A little bit.

2319
01:43:10,530 --> 01:43:10,870
Oh, no.

2320
01:43:12,030 --> 01:43:13,370
I don't have it.

2321
01:43:13,650 --> 01:43:15,310
Oh, below us, below us, right here.

2322
01:43:16,310 --> 01:43:17,170
Is this a team that killed me?

2323
01:43:17,810 --> 01:43:18,510
I think this is a team that killed me.

2324
01:43:18,510 --> 01:43:19,450
Yeah, there's one team.

2325
01:43:19,990 --> 01:43:20,750
Wait, nice.

2326
01:43:21,250 --> 01:43:22,430
Oh, very little, very little.

2327
01:43:22,490 --> 01:43:23,850
I need a healer.

2328
01:43:24,190 --> 01:43:25,310
No, no, no, no, no team, no team.

2329
01:43:30,770 --> 01:43:31,690
Come to me, Uto.

2330
01:43:31,810 --> 01:43:32,670
Come to me, come to me, come to me, come to me.

2331
01:43:32,870 --> 01:43:33,670
Back up, back up, back up.

2332
01:43:34,090 --> 01:43:35,450
I think we need to go a different way.

2333
01:43:37,970 --> 01:43:39,070
We might have to go drop down.

2334
01:43:40,090 --> 01:43:40,230
Yep.

2335
01:43:40,850 --> 01:43:43,670
Whoa, whoa, be careful.

2336
01:43:45,350 --> 01:43:46,030
Might have to arm start?

2337
01:43:46,470 --> 01:43:46,750
Yeah.

2338
01:43:48,910 --> 01:43:50,250
Oh, I stuck him.

2339
01:43:50,290 --> 01:43:51,130
Nice, nice, nice, nice.

2340
01:43:51,370 --> 01:43:52,230
I stuck, I stuck, it stuck.

2341
01:43:54,050 --> 01:43:55,230
We can be right below them.

2342
01:43:56,470 --> 01:43:57,770
Yeah, we can't get below them.

2343
01:43:58,130 --> 01:43:58,510
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2344
01:43:59,510 --> 01:44:00,590
Hey, they can't do anything.

2345
01:44:01,550 --> 01:44:01,750
Yep.

2346
01:44:02,110 --> 01:44:02,150
Here.

2347
01:44:02,430 --> 01:44:03,370
Oh, look over there.

2348
01:44:03,890 --> 01:44:05,470
They can't do anything about us here.

2349
01:44:05,610 --> 01:44:06,370
And they'll say drop down.

2350
01:44:06,490 --> 01:44:07,750
I don't think they'll drop down.

2351
01:44:08,430 --> 01:44:09,090
They're not.

2352
01:44:09,830 --> 01:44:10,970
Yeah, they don't want to.

2353
01:44:13,290 --> 01:44:14,310
Okay, they miss.

2354
01:44:14,990 --> 01:44:17,210
Do you have shields or no?

2355
01:44:17,450 --> 01:44:17,670
Whoa.

2356
01:44:18,070 --> 01:44:18,630
I'm safe here.

2357
01:44:18,690 --> 01:44:19,610
I'm safe here.

2358
01:44:24,340 --> 01:44:24,760
I'm safe.

2359
01:44:25,800 --> 01:44:26,580
Don't worry.

2360
01:44:26,780 --> 01:44:27,400
We're safe.

2361
01:44:28,580 --> 01:44:29,740
We're so safe.

2362
01:44:29,940 --> 01:44:30,900
We're so healthy.

2363
01:44:31,740 --> 01:44:33,080
We're so healthy.

2364
01:44:35,600 --> 01:44:38,500
Okay, we're fine.

2365
01:44:39,100 --> 01:44:39,540
Okay.

2366
01:44:41,240 --> 01:44:42,480
We're so healthy.

2367
01:44:42,960 --> 01:44:44,160
Do you have a shield cell, Suto?

2368
01:44:44,800 --> 01:44:46,820
I have a shield cell.

2369
01:44:47,540 --> 01:44:49,080
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

Oh my god, no, no, we can't, we can't.

2373
01:44:55,400 --> 01:44:55,920
We can't, we can't.

2374
01:44:55,960 --> 01:44:59,080
This team is gonna drop down on us.

2375
01:45:00,540 --> 01:45:01,060
Unless...

2376
01:45:02,680 --> 01:45:06,200

Oh, if I push...

3075
02:13:09,890 --> 02:13:12,590
I didn't think they would push so fast.

3076
02:13:13,350 --> 02:13:14,750
I was too slow behind.

3077
02:13:15,010 --> 02:13:16,350

02:13:22,850 --> 02:13:23,830
That game doesn't count.

3082
02:13:26,270 --> 02:13:27,530

02:33:56,290 --> 02:33:56,770
Solo three.

3623
02:33:56,970 --> 02:33:57,270
Solo three.

3624
02:33:57,490 --> 02:33:57,730
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:34:00,830 --> 02:34:01,470
You're solo.

3627
02:34:01,870 --> 02:34:02,570
Get out of here.

3628
02:34:03,430 --> 02:34:04,310

They're gonna come to us.

3636
02:34:17,330 --> 02:34:19,110
We have to focus that team for it.

3637
02:34:19,270 --> 02:34:20,030
Okay, I need to...

02:34:20,710 --> 02:34:21,050

3646
02:34:30,830 --> 02:34:32,290
I feel like he has...

3647
02:34:32,290 --> 02:34:33,010
Yeah, we have Hammerport.

3648
02:34:33,090 --> 02:34:34,650
If they come close to us, we have Hammerport.

3649
02:34:37,230 --> 02:34:38,130
Flash, flash, flash!

3650
02:34:38,510 --> 02:34:39,230

Nice.

3655
02:34:46,450 --> 02:34:47,150
One down.

3656
02:34:47,310 --> 02:34:48,290
I'd focus this team.

3657
02:34:48,830 --> 02:34:49,270
This...

3658
02:34:49,270 --> 02:34:49,950
Yeah, this team.

3659
02:34:50,210 --> 02:34:51,350
Don't kill this so...

3660
02:34:51,350 --> 02:34:52,110
Don't kill this guy.

3661
02:34:52,230 --> 02:34:52,630
He's a solo.

3662
02:34:53,250 --> 02:34:53,690
Below us.

3663
02:34:54,010 --> 02:34:55,530
We want this solo to help us.

3664
02:34:59,330 --> 02:35:00,470
One guy solo.

3665
02:35:00,930 --> 02:35:02,550
Yeah, he didn't thirst him, right?

3666
02:35:03,270 --> 02:35:04,570
Oh, I didn't have...

3667
02:35:06,550 --> 02:35:09,950
I don't have angle to kill them.

3668
02:35:11,610 --> 02:35:12,910
I'm batting, I'm batting.

3669
02:35:14,990 --> 02:35:16,630
Don't kill the solo below.

3670
02:35:16,890 --> 02:35:17,730
We want him to help us.

3671
02:35:18,590 --> 02:35:18,870
Yeah.

3672
02:35:19,090 --> 02:35:20,450
Yeah, he's helping us.

3673
02:35:20,610 --> 02:35:22,230
We want him to help us kill this team.

3674
02:35:24,330 --> 02:35:24,790
Okay.

3675
02:35:26,070 --> 02:35:27,530
That's our secret member.

3676
02:35:28,150 --> 02:35:29,770
Yeah, he is our teammate.

3677
02:35:29,950 --> 02:35:30,910
He is our fourth player.

3678
02:35:34,910 --> 02:35:35,430
Kill him!

3679
02:35:37,210 --> 02:35:40,050
They want to kill the rat, but we won't let them.

3680
02:35:40,890 --> 02:35:43,570
Look at how many heavy ammo do you have right now?

3681
02:35:43,570 --> 02:35:44,750
I have 178 here.

3682
02:35:44,990 --> 02:35:45,510
I can get 58.

3683
02:35:46,150 --> 02:35:46,770
Okay, okay.

Yeah, they have to run.

3687
02:35:56,590 --> 02:35:57,850
They have to run to us.

3688
02:36:05,550 --> 02:36:07,290
Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot the people on this.

3689
02:36:09,850 --> 02:36:10,270

Safe on me.

Right here, this guy.

02:42:30,710 --> 02:42:31,410
Hammer boy.

3832
02:42:31,990 --> 02:42:33,390
Damn boy.

3833
02:42:34,490 --> 02:42:34,770
No.

3834
02:42:35,850 --> 02:42:36,150
No.

3835
02:42:36,510 --> 02:42:36,510
No?

3836
02:42:36,510 --> 02:42:37,570
No, can I?

3837
02:42:38,370 --> 02:42:38,830
No!

3838
02:42:39,950 --> 02:42:40,530
No!

3839
02:42:40,810 --> 02:42:41,550
No, hammer boy.

3840
02:42:41,970 --> 02:42:42,410
No.

3841
02:42:43,770 --> 02:42:44,890
Wait, wait, fight in front.

3842
02:42:45,490 --> 02:42:46,130
I'm gonna go.

3843
02:42:47,330 --> 02:42:47,970
Okay, enemy.

3844
02:42:48,370 --> 02:42:48,850
Yeah, enemy.

3845
02:42:49,830 --> 02:42:51,890
I heard a grenade.

3846
02:42:53,930 --> 02:42:55,790
Okay, I will make our...

3847
02:42:56,890 --> 02:42:57,590
Oh, I see.

3848
02:42:57,790 --> 02:42:58,730
I'm gonna ask you, army.

3849
02:42:59,430 --> 02:43:00,110
I'm pretty far.

3850
02:43:00,370 --> 02:43:00,610
Be careful.

3851
02:43:01,090 --> 02:43:01,410
Oh,

3852
02:43:06,040 --> 02:43:06,760
big house.

3853
02:43:06,940 --> 02:43:07,380
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3854
02:43:07,540 --> 02:43:08,160
I think we wait.

3855
02:43:08,420 --> 02:43:09,380
We wait, we wait, we wait.

3856
02:43:09,380 --> 02:43:10,840
Wait for Ditto.

3857
02:43:12,400 --> 02:43:12,800
Okay.

3858
02:43:13,720 --> 02:43:15,260
Oh, and res too.

3859
02:43:16,140 --> 02:43:17,380
Maybe they come to me.

3860
02:43:18,620 --> 02:43:18,940
What?

3861
02:43:19,400 --> 02:43:20,140
No, no, no, no.

3862
02:43:20,180 --> 02:43:21,540
Oh, you're so far.

3863
02:43:22,300 --> 02:43:23,240
What do you mean?

3864
02:43:23,440 --> 02:43:23,860
They're here.

3865
02:43:24,100 --> 02:43:25,060
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

3866
02:43:25,460 --> 02:43:26,260
What do you mean?

3867
02:43:26,260 --> 02:43:27,320
They're racing, they're racing.

3868
02:43:27,760 --> 02:43:28,240
Yeah, they're racing.

3869
02:43:28,260 --> 02:43:29,700
I'm using it in front of them.

3870
02:43:31,660 --> 02:43:31,980
Maybe...

3871
02:43:31,980 --> 02:43:32,780
Oh, there's two res!

3872
02:43:32,840 --> 02:43:33,700
No, no, no, it's two res!

3873
02:43:34,080 --> 02:43:34,340
Two res!

3874
02:43:34,480 --> 02:43:34,860
Two res!

3875
02:43:35,580 --> 02:43:36,300
I'm going, I'm going.

3876
02:43:37,680 --> 02:43:38,700
Tell me if you need Q.

3877
02:43:39,620 --> 02:43:41,740
I'm gonna climb.

3878
02:43:43,260 --> 02:43:44,080
Okay, I'm climbing up.

3879
02:43:44,800 --> 02:43:45,700
I don't need Q yet.

3880
02:43:45,740 --> 02:43:46,380
No Q, no Q.

3881
02:43:50,220 --> 02:43:50,540
Two.

3882
02:43:51,280 --> 02:43:51,600
Two.

3883
02:43:51,880 --> 02:43:52,540
Let me know when you crack.

3884
02:43:52,640 --> 02:43:53,080
Let me know when you crack.

3885
02:43:53,920 --> 02:43:54,840
When you crack, I'll call.

3886
02:43:55,020 --> 02:43:56,260
Not crack, not, not crack yet.

3887
02:43:56,380 --> 02:43:56,560
Okay.

3888
02:43:58,620 --> 02:43:59,860
I can...

3889
02:43:59,860 --> 02:44:00,820
Okay, I'm waiting.

3890
02:44:03,280 --> 02:44:04,380
Waiting too.

3891
02:44:08,800 --> 02:44:09,960
Wait, they're white armor!

3892
02:44:10,900 --> 02:44:12,380
Cue me, cue me, cue me, cue me, cue me.

3893
02:44:17,190 --> 02:44:17,990
Take one.

3894
02:44:18,870 --> 02:44:21,670
I don't know where teammates are.

3895
02:44:22,750 --> 02:44:23,070
Tommy?

3896
02:44:25,720 --> 02:44:26,650
Knock one?

3897
02:44:28,980 --> 02:44:29,180
Okay.

3898
02:44:32,660 --> 02:44:33,800
Nice one.

3899
02:44:34,060 --> 02:44:34,340
Nice.

3900
02:44:34,780 --> 02:44:36,380
They were white armor, too.

3901
02:44:36,400 --> 02:44:37,500
Oh, wow, wow.

3902
02:44:37,560 --> 02:44:39,500
Haha, babies.

3903
02:44:42,680 --> 02:44:43,120
Yeah.

3904
02:44:46,000 --> 02:44:46,580
Where was he?

3905
02:44:46,640 --> 02:44:47,760
Where's one of them?

3906
02:44:47,940 --> 02:44:48,260
Oh, wait.

3907
02:44:48,500 --> 02:44:49,020
Someone, someone, someone.

3908
02:44:49,400 --> 02:44:49,640
Oh, wait.

3909
02:44:50,080 --> 02:44:50,620
I hear someone.

3910
02:44:51,200 --> 02:44:51,960
Oh, no, no.

3911
02:44:51,960 --> 02:44:52,360
Jump pad.

3912
02:44:52,700 --> 02:44:53,160
Tower, tower.

3913
02:44:55,960 --> 02:44:56,600
Oh, yeah.

3914
02:44:57,180 --> 02:44:57,220
Okay.

3915
02:44:57,440 --> 02:44:57,880
Where?

3916
02:44:58,060 --> 02:44:59,500
Are they gonna come to us?

3917
02:44:59,740 --> 02:45:00,640
No, no, no, no.

3918
02:45:00,800 --> 02:45:01,580
They're here.

3919
02:45:01,940 --> 02:45:02,180
Okay.

3920
02:45:02,380 --> 02:45:02,520
They're way.

3921
02:45:02,520 --> 02:45:03,740
Far, far, far, far, far.

3922
02:45:03,960 --> 02:45:04,300
Very far.

3923
02:45:08,700 --> 02:45:09,420
I'm good.

3924
02:45:10,080 --> 02:45:10,620
I'm gonna heal.

3925
02:45:15,780 --> 02:45:16,220
Whoa.

3926
02:45:17,000 --> 02:45:18,180
They have man Maggie.

3927
02:45:20,140 --> 02:45:20,440
Whoa.

3928
02:45:21,600 --> 02:45:21,880
Chill.

3929
02:45:22,940 --> 02:45:23,760
Where are the other boxes?

3930
02:45:25,060 --> 02:45:25,680
I don't know.

3931
02:45:25,820 --> 02:45:26,320
I'm flying.

3932
02:45:26,480 --> 02:45:26,820
I'm flying.

3933
02:45:27,080 --> 02:45:28,240
You ping me some of the boxes?

3934
02:45:28,520 --> 02:45:29,320
Wait, they might push.

3935
02:45:30,260 --> 02:45:30,540
Okay.

3936
02:45:31,340 --> 02:45:31,640
Push.

3937
02:45:32,100 --> 02:45:32,580
Yeah, yeah.

3938
02:45:32,580 --> 02:45:33,420
They're coming closer.

3939
02:45:34,240 --> 02:45:34,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3940
02:45:34,760 --> 02:45:35,880
They're here, they're here, they're here.

3941
02:45:36,500 --> 02:45:36,920
They're here, here, here.

3942
02:45:37,880 --> 02:45:38,220
Careful.

3943
02:45:39,140 --> 02:45:41,120
They're inside, they're inside.

3944
02:45:41,120 --> 02:45:42,840
Yeah, they're inside.

3945
02:45:44,140 --> 02:45:45,040
Uh, third floor?

3946
02:45:45,200 --> 02:45:46,240
Yeah, yeah, let's go to the third floor.

3947
02:45:47,200 --> 02:45:50,120
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3948
02:45:50,460 --> 02:45:54,940
I might be dead here.

3949
02:45:55,140 --> 02:45:57,040
Oh, I cracked him!

3950
02:45:57,900 --> 02:45:58,600
Oh, no!

3951
02:45:59,300 --> 02:45:59,840
Oh my god.

3952
02:46:00,700 --> 02:46:01,040
Run!

3953
02:46:01,220 --> 02:46:01,880
Ditto, run!

3954
02:46:02,040 --> 02:46:02,800
You can craft!

3955
02:46:03,280 --> 02:46:04,220
Don't be a hero!

3956
02:46:05,640 --> 02:46:07,020
Don't be a hero!

3957
02:46:07,240 --> 02:46:08,260
No hero time!

3958
02:46:08,360 --> 02:46:08,920
Just leave!

3959
02:46:09,700 --> 02:46:10,140
Leave!

3960
02:46:11,160 --> 02:46:11,760
No!

3961
02:46:12,120 --> 02:46:12,360
No!

3962
02:46:12,980 --> 02:46:13,580
No!

3963
02:46:13,860 --> 02:46:14,540
I'm leaving!

3964
02:46:14,900 --> 02:46:15,080
I'm leaving!

3965
02:46:15,460 --> 02:46:16,140
Stop being a hero!

3966
02:46:16,560 --> 02:46:16,880
Just run!

3967
02:46:20,580 --> 02:46:22,820
Oh, they're a controller.

3968
02:46:23,520 --> 02:46:24,780
By the way, they're a controller.

3969
02:46:25,040 --> 02:46:25,380
Just leave.

3970
02:46:26,840 --> 02:46:28,060
All three of them are a controller.

3971
02:46:28,360 --> 02:46:28,760
Just leave.

3972
02:46:31,580 --> 02:46:33,260
Go as far as you can!

3973
02:46:33,440 --> 02:46:35,140
So they can't aim assist you.

3974
02:46:36,280 --> 02:46:36,660
Okay.

3975
02:46:37,300 --> 02:46:38,260
Seven feet!

3976
02:46:38,400 --> 02:46:40,600
Because it's out of the six feet range.

3977
02:46:40,860 --> 02:46:41,520
Okay.

3978
02:46:41,920 --> 02:46:44,040
Make sure you're seven feet away.

3979
02:46:45,720 --> 02:46:48,020
Oh, you should heal though.

3980
02:46:48,220 --> 02:46:49,240
You're so much healed.

3981
02:46:50,840 --> 02:46:52,800
Oh, slow way come, slow way come.

3982
02:46:53,460 --> 02:46:54,260
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3983
02:46:56,620 --> 02:46:59,260
Make sure you're seven feet away from the controller
players.

3984
02:46:59,680 --> 02:47:00,800
Okay, seven feet.

3985
02:47:01,000 --> 02:47:01,180
Yeah.

3986
02:47:01,720 --> 02:47:03,740
So you don't get me and get killed.

3987
02:47:06,760 --> 02:47:08,860
I wish I was so early.

3988
02:47:11,920 --> 02:47:13,860
Why didn't we learn Controlly?

3989
02:47:17,280 --> 02:47:17,840
Okay.

3990
02:47:28,440 --> 02:47:29,000
Nice.

3991
02:47:30,160 --> 02:47:31,500
I think I should...

3992
02:47:31,500 --> 02:47:32,500
No, you resus here.

3993
02:47:32,720 --> 02:47:32,840
Yeah.

3994
02:47:33,500 --> 02:47:34,400
It's zone two.

3995
02:47:34,580 --> 02:47:35,000
It's fine.

3996
02:47:35,500 --> 02:47:37,400
I don't know if they're gonna come to us.

3997
02:47:37,900 --> 02:47:38,920
Okay, they do.

3998
02:47:39,360 --> 02:47:40,220
We run.

3999
02:47:40,520 --> 02:47:40,940
We run.

4000
02:47:41,500 --> 02:47:42,220
We run.

4001
02:47:42,540 --> 02:47:42,800
Okay.

4002
02:47:44,360 --> 02:47:44,480
Okay.

4003
02:47:45,180 --> 02:47:45,380
Okay.

4004
02:47:47,660 --> 02:47:48,540
We run.

4005
02:47:50,380 --> 02:47:51,900
Wait, we're not being cowards.

4006
02:47:52,080 --> 02:47:52,940
It's strategy.

4007
02:47:53,280 --> 02:47:54,300
Oh, I see them.

4008
02:47:54,420 --> 02:47:55,240
I see them.

4009
02:47:56,500 --> 02:47:57,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4010
02:47:57,880 --> 02:47:58,380
Okay, I run.

4011
02:47:59,340 --> 02:47:59,520
Run.

4012
02:47:59,840 --> 02:48:00,480
Peace, run.

4013
02:48:03,780 --> 02:48:04,040
Okay.

4014
02:48:05,080 --> 02:48:05,780
Just run.

4015
02:48:06,000 --> 02:48:06,340
Just run.

4016
02:48:08,160 --> 02:48:09,220
I saw me.

4017
02:48:09,360 --> 02:48:09,720
Just saw me.

4018
02:48:10,480 --> 02:48:10,940
Just saw me.

4019
02:48:10,980 --> 02:48:11,540
Just saw me.

4020
02:48:12,420 --> 02:48:14,820
If one of us lives, that's okay.

4021
02:48:16,260 --> 02:48:17,740
Only one has to live.

4022
02:48:17,740 --> 02:48:19,180
What the fuck?

4023
02:48:21,500 --> 02:48:22,980

4024
02:48:27,440 --> 02:48:28,000
That's okay.

4025
02:48:29,360 --> 02:48:30,740
Just one of us has to live.

4026
02:48:31,980 --> 02:48:33,480
That's all we need.

4027
02:48:34,160 --> 02:48:34,880

Okay, I'm safe right now.

4033
02:48:48,050 --> 02:48:48,910
Are they chasing?

4034
02:48:49,430 --> 02:48:50,190
Nice, nice, nice.

4035
02:48:50,470 --> 02:48:51,930

4036
02:48:52,030 --> 02:48:52,450
They're chasing me!

4037
02:48:52,650 --> 02:48:54,270
No, why are you?

4038
02:48:59,190 --> 02:48:59,470
What?

4039
02:49:00,650 --> 02:49:04,610
How so... Okay, this is a controller prank squad.

4040
02:49:04,970 --> 02:49:06,970
Wait, you got a tattoo?

4041
02:49:07,550 --> 02:49:09,130
Wait, who did you kill you?

4042
02:49:10,770 --> 02:49:12,310
Who killed you?

4043
02:49:13,190 --> 02:49:15,610

4046
02:49:22,910 --> 02:49:23,950
Oh my god.

4047
02:49:23,990 --> 02:49:24,790
Oh my god.

4048
02:49:24,910 --> 02:49:26,390
This chasing shoots all hard.

4049
02:49:26,590 --> 02:49:27,170
Oh my god.

4050
02:49:27,290 --> 02:49:30,910
You know, when it was worse, they were controller pred
players.

4051
02:49:31,590 --> 02:49:32,670
Not only were they pred.

4052
02:49:33,270 --> 02:49:34,730
They were controller pred.

4053
02:49:35,710 --> 02:49:36,450
Contour paint.

4054
02:49:36,830 --> 02:49:36,950
I see.

4055
02:49:37,270 --> 02:49:37,270
Yeah.

4056
02:49:37,890 --> 02:49:39,250
They were less at the life.

4057
02:49:39,950 --> 02:49:42,570
That changes everything.

4058
02:49:45,250 --> 02:49:46,970
Guys, it wasn't stream snipers.

4059
02:49:47,150 --> 02:49:48,710
They're just good at the game.

4060
02:49:49,210 --> 02:49:52,570
They just... We will know if it's stream snipers.

4061
02:49:52,650 --> 02:49:53,950
We wouldn't know.

4062
02:49:54,990 --> 02:49:57,770
They saw a res and they saw me.

4063
02:50:00,630 --> 02:50:01,450
Oh, okay.

4064
02:50:05,610 --> 02:50:06,090
Oh.

4065
02:50:07,170 --> 02:50:08,270
Oh my god.

4066
02:50:08,810 --> 02:50:10,450
They are so thirsty.

4067
02:50:10,850 --> 02:50:12,190
They want more kills.

4068
02:50:12,330 --> 02:50:14,050
They want to get to Pred again.

4069
02:50:15,230 --> 02:50:15,910
Oh, I see.

4070
02:50:16,130 --> 02:50:17,410
Is that a Pred team?

4071
02:50:17,810 --> 02:50:19,030
Yeah, yeah, that was a Pred team.

4072
02:50:19,610 --> 02:50:20,950
Oh, we are Pred too, okay.

4073

Okay.

4078

I didn't want to live in this game.

72 players!

4080
02:51:08,810 --> 02:51:09,590

No, wake up.

4087

You don't sleep when you're grinding rank.

03:09:21,990 --> 03:09:22,670
Yeah.

4455
03:09:23,230 --> 03:09:28,510
I mean, we could go here and then see if they're still, if
they started fighting it in fragment.

4456
03:09:29,230 --> 03:09:29,670
Oh, okay.

03:09:40,350 --> 03:09:41,950

That always scares me.

4467
03:09:46,530 --> 03:09:47,970
I thought, I feel like I'm being shot.

4468
03:09:49,290 --> 03:09:50,710
I know, I know.

4469
03:09:54,150 --> 03:09:56,070

Skull piercer?

4474
03:10:07,670 --> 03:10:08,670

I think I'm good with my loot.

4487
03:10:30,310 --> 03:10:33,010
I'm going to go check and I'm going to grab a harvester.

4488
03:10:33,590 --> 03:10:33,970

And there's a claim here, too.

4511
03:10:55,410 --> 03:10:56,170
Under the bridge.

4512
03:10:56,970 --> 03:10:58,230
They might fight each other.

4513
03:10:59,150 --> 03:10:59,890
Yeah, they're pushing.

4514
03:11:00,610 --> 03:11:00,910
They're pushing.

4515
03:11:01,110 --> 03:11:01,390
They're pushing.

4516
03:11:04,750 --> 03:11:05,470
Knock one.

4517
03:11:05,630 --> 03:11:06,230

4518
03:11:06,550 --> 03:11:06,930
Nice one.

4519
03:11:07,190 --> 03:11:07,790
On me, on me.

4520
03:11:12,090 --> 03:11:12,890
Almost kicked.

4521
03:11:13,470 --> 03:11:14,350
Crack, crack, crack.

4522
03:11:14,950 --> 03:11:15,410
This is three.

4523
03:11:15,670 --> 03:11:16,470
This is a full team.

4524
03:11:16,610 --> 03:11:17,070
It's behind me.

4525
03:11:17,630 --> 03:11:18,090
Very weak.

4526
03:11:18,250 --> 03:11:18,630
Very low.

4527
03:11:19,690 --> 03:11:20,110

No more ammo.

03:11:33,450 --> 03:11:33,990
Are you gonna lie?

4533
03:11:34,010 --> 03:11:35,210
I think we have to back out.

4534
03:11:36,070 --> 03:11:37,110
It's still three teams.

4535
03:11:37,250 --> 03:11:38,070
It's still three teams.

4536
03:11:38,310 --> 03:11:39,570

4743
03:19:41,410 --> 03:19:41,670
I don't want.

4744
03:19:41,810 --> 03:19:41,950
Careful.

4745
03:19:43,450 --> 03:19:44,430
We're not in zone.

4746
03:19:44,510 --> 03:19:45,430
I need a heal.

4747
03:19:45,610 --> 03:19:47,450
I don't have, I only have small meds.

4748
03:19:48,370 --> 03:19:50,150
Only small meds.

4749
03:19:53,350 --> 03:19:53,990
Crack one.

4750
03:19:54,190 --> 03:19:54,510
Oh.

4751
03:19:54,890 --> 03:19:55,910
I'm pushing, I'm pushing.

4752
03:19:56,290 --> 03:19:56,790
I'm gonna push.

4753
03:19:56,930 --> 03:19:57,110
Okay.

4754
03:19:59,430 --> 03:20:00,250
Oh my gosh, I have a point!

4755
03:20:01,550 --> 03:20:03,110
I'm going, I'm going, I'm coming, I'm coming.

4756
03:20:03,270 --> 03:20:04,070
Down, down, down.

4757
03:20:04,150 --> 03:20:04,430
Nice.

4758
03:20:04,910 --> 03:20:05,250
Nice job.

4759
03:20:05,370 --> 03:20:06,190
Okay, that might- Oh!

4760
03:20:06,570 --> 03:20:06,930
Do you have Q?

4761
03:20:07,050 --> 03:20:07,270
Do you have Q?

4762
03:20:07,390 --> 03:20:07,610
Do you have Q?

4763
03:20:08,270 --> 03:20:08,770
Yeah, yeah.

4764
03:20:08,950 --> 03:20:09,150
Okay.

4765
03:20:09,910 --> 03:20:10,790
Oh, I have Q.

4766
03:20:11,250 --> 03:20:11,630
Oh yeah.

4767
03:20:12,890 --> 03:20:13,450
Give me two.

4768
03:20:14,390 --> 03:20:15,090
Crack, crack, crack.

4769
03:20:15,630 --> 03:20:16,050
No, crack.

4770
03:20:19,050 --> 03:20:19,450
26?

4771
03:20:20,170 --> 03:20:20,530
I need a bat.

4772
03:20:20,690 --> 03:20:22,390
I need a bat.

4773
03:20:25,440 --> 03:20:25,880
Good, I'm good.

4774
03:20:27,040 --> 03:20:28,080
Do you thirst him?

4775
03:20:28,220 --> 03:20:30,360
I'm gonna thirst him.

4776
03:20:32,580 --> 03:20:33,680
Where's the hammer point?

4777
03:20:33,780 --> 03:20:34,420
Where is it?

4778
03:20:34,520 --> 03:20:35,520
Oh, they're so poor.

4779
03:20:36,020 --> 03:20:38,420
No, you guys didn't have it.

4780
03:20:39,040 --> 03:20:39,520
What the point?

4781
03:20:40,260 --> 03:20:41,300
Where was it?

4782
03:20:41,460 --> 03:20:42,460
Oh, we have to go.

4783
03:20:42,640 --> 03:20:43,240
We have to go.

4784
03:20:43,300 --> 03:20:44,720
Do you have redeploy or no?

4785
03:20:45,900 --> 03:20:47,260
Oh, I have I have hit here.

4786
03:20:48,540 --> 03:20:49,180
Enemy here.

4787
03:20:49,580 --> 03:20:50,280
What was in that?

4788
03:20:50,340 --> 03:20:51,040
I don't remember.

4789
03:20:51,360 --> 03:20:51,700
Alright.

4790
03:20:52,380 --> 03:20:53,440
We have to go.

4791
03:20:53,740 --> 03:20:55,480
Wait, we can actually go here.

4792
03:20:55,600 --> 03:20:56,140
Do you want to go tunnels?

4793
03:20:57,140 --> 03:20:57,480
Yeah.

4794
03:20:58,380 --> 03:20:59,720
Yeah, we can go tunnels.

4795
03:20:59,720 --> 03:21:00,180
Yeah, we can go tunnel, tunnel.

4796
03:21:01,020 --> 03:21:01,560
Come now.

4797
03:21:04,860 --> 03:21:05,340
Alright.

4798
03:21:05,720 --> 03:21:06,200
We should be.

4799
03:21:06,320 --> 03:21:07,140
One team there.

4800
03:21:08,020 --> 03:21:09,260
Yeah, let's just stay in tunnel.

4801
03:21:10,040 --> 03:21:10,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4802
03:21:10,880 --> 03:21:15,040
I can't believe the guy we didn't kill was the one with the
hammer point.

4803
03:21:15,160 --> 03:21:16,120
I'm so sad.

4804
03:21:17,900 --> 03:21:19,520
I'm so fucking sad.

4805
03:21:19,680 --> 03:21:20,160
Of course!

4806
03:21:21,840 --> 03:21:22,720
Of course.

4807
03:21:23,020 --> 03:21:24,460
I will look left.

4808
03:21:25,160 --> 03:21:26,240
Okay, there's no one.

4809
03:21:26,560 --> 03:21:27,820
Maybe we can get...

4810
03:21:27,820 --> 03:21:29,800
Can we get above?

4811
03:21:30,460 --> 03:21:30,920
On top.

4812
03:21:30,920 --> 03:21:31,420
I can go here.

4813
03:21:31,780 --> 03:21:32,400
Okay, okay.

4814
03:21:32,600 --> 03:21:33,440
They're fighting each other.

4815
03:21:33,840 --> 03:21:34,700
I don't have battery.

4816
03:21:35,740 --> 03:21:36,520
But I have my Q.

4817
03:21:37,720 --> 03:21:39,080
I'm gonna scout.

4818
03:21:43,570 --> 03:21:44,570
One, one fish.

4819
03:21:44,710 --> 03:21:45,370
One fish there.

4820
03:21:45,590 --> 03:21:45,810
I know.

4821
03:21:45,930 --> 03:21:47,530
I want to make sure we don't get flanks.

4822
03:21:49,910 --> 03:21:50,270
Okay.

4823
03:21:51,710 --> 03:21:52,150
Woo.

4824
03:21:54,830 --> 03:21:57,130
They have two, they have two, they have two.

4825
03:21:57,410 --> 03:21:57,430
Okay.

4826
03:21:58,270 --> 03:21:58,890
Behind the line.

4827
03:21:59,430 --> 03:22:00,650
Can you scan back here, though?

4828
03:22:01,070 --> 03:22:01,270
Can you scan?

4829
03:22:01,410 --> 03:22:01,790
Yeah, yeah, scan.

4830
03:22:01,910 --> 03:22:02,450
Yeah, I knew it.

4831
03:22:02,570 --> 03:22:03,470
I knew there was people there.

4832
03:22:04,750 --> 03:22:05,030
Nice.

4833
03:22:05,470 --> 03:22:07,810
I remember there was a fight there or something.

4834
03:22:09,690 --> 03:22:12,430
Okay, one, two, and another team.

4835
03:22:12,810 --> 03:22:14,110
I'm not sure where are they.

4836
03:22:14,370 --> 03:22:15,270
So low here, I think.

4837
03:22:16,270 --> 03:22:16,630
Right here?

4838
03:22:19,830 --> 03:22:20,390
Lay slow.

4839
03:22:21,070 --> 03:22:22,110
I don't have angle.

4840
03:22:22,470 --> 03:22:22,690
Okay?

4841
03:22:23,070 --> 03:22:23,590
No angle.

4842
03:22:24,270 --> 03:22:25,210
Okay, me too.

4843
03:22:25,330 --> 03:22:25,750
No angle.

4844
03:22:27,930 --> 03:22:30,290
You guys, you guys, you guys wash here.

4845
03:22:30,450 --> 03:22:31,210
I will wash our back.

4846
03:22:32,350 --> 03:22:33,630
Oh my god.

4847
03:22:34,650 --> 03:22:35,490
Okay, I need a heal.

4848
03:22:36,430 --> 03:22:39,110
I want to make sure the team to my left doesn't push us.

4849
03:22:39,190 --> 03:22:40,210
Yeah, you make sure the team...

4850
03:22:40,210 --> 03:22:40,930
Yeah, solo here.

4851
03:22:45,230 --> 03:22:46,530
Yeah, he has red armor.

4852
03:22:48,030 --> 03:22:48,470
Crack.

4853
03:22:48,830 --> 03:22:49,190
Nice.

4854
03:22:49,510 --> 03:22:50,350
You get the solo?

4855
03:22:50,430 --> 03:22:51,590
I hear the solo here.

4856
03:22:52,570 --> 03:22:53,410
Do you guys have light ammo?

4857
03:22:54,150 --> 03:22:54,590
Oh.

4858
03:22:54,610 --> 03:22:55,710
No, no, they're not.

4859
03:22:56,210 --> 03:22:57,230
There's a solar light.

4860
03:23:01,370 --> 03:23:02,030
Focus here.

4861
03:23:02,130 --> 03:23:02,670
Focus this guy.

4862
03:23:03,050 --> 03:23:03,370
By himself.

4863
03:23:03,650 --> 03:23:04,050
Behind this rock.

4864
03:23:04,530 --> 03:23:05,090
I'm going back.

4865
03:23:05,350 --> 03:23:05,590
Yeah, yeah.

4866
03:23:08,570 --> 03:23:09,010
Someone...

4867
03:23:09,010 --> 03:23:10,470
Okay, this is really risky.

4868
03:23:10,570 --> 03:23:11,070
Here, this guy.

4869
03:23:13,910 --> 03:23:15,750
Oh, I don't have a lot of ammo left.

4870
03:23:18,650 --> 03:23:20,130
I can't give you heavy ammo.

4871
03:23:20,450 --> 03:23:20,990
This is not zone.

4872
03:23:22,010 --> 03:23:22,370
Okay.

4873
03:23:23,110 --> 03:23:23,890
Do you want heavy ammo?

4874
03:23:24,670 --> 03:23:25,590
Oh, okay.

4875
03:23:25,890 --> 03:23:26,150
Okay.

4876

4879
03:24:03,750 --> 03:24:04,750
I'm just gonna wait.

4880
03:24:06,850 --> 03:24:07,470
Oh my god.

4881
03:24:07,630 --> 03:24:08,010
I'm gonna wait.

4882
03:24:08,110 --> 03:24:09,570
I don't- I only have close range.

4883
03:24:12,230 --> 03:24:12,610
Okay.

4884
03:24:13,730 --> 03:24:15,190
What are you using right now?

4885
03:24:15,890 --> 03:24:16,690
Carbine, prowler.

4886
03:24:16,870 --> 03:24:18,550
I don't have light, so I'll just- I have prowler.

4887
03:24:19,810 --> 03:24:20,470
Careful, careful!

4888
03:24:21,070 --> 03:24:22,210
Yeah, I'll cover, I'll cover.

4889
03:24:23,650 --> 03:24:24,270
Thank you.

4890
03:24:26,390 --> 03:24:27,570
Oh, they're right below me.

4891
03:24:27,570 --> 03:24:28,930
They're queued below us.

4892
03:24:29,630 --> 03:24:30,070
Okay.

4893
03:24:30,290 --> 03:24:32,630
Be careful, they're his allies.

4894
03:24:36,430 --> 03:24:37,710
They're right below me.

4895
03:24:37,890 --> 03:24:38,610
Yeah, yeah, right here.

4896
03:24:43,980 --> 03:24:44,840
I'm looking at climb up.

4897
03:24:45,560 --> 03:24:46,880
I can't get any anger.

4898
03:24:48,020 --> 03:24:49,300
I'm making sure they don't climb up.

4899
03:24:49,580 --> 03:24:52,220
This team on our left, this team has to come to us.

4900
03:24:52,680 --> 03:24:54,020
Or this team has to rotate first.

4901
03:24:54,280 --> 03:24:54,980
Careful, Ditto.

4902
03:24:55,120 --> 03:24:56,340
They might rush you.

4903
03:24:56,420 --> 03:24:57,060
Okay, okay, okay.

4904
03:24:57,760 --> 03:24:58,840
They might try and rush you.

4905
03:24:59,760 --> 03:25:02,580
I think we should be like a bit closer.

4906
03:25:03,700 --> 03:25:04,140
Yeah.

4907
03:25:05,980 --> 03:25:06,680
1 o'clock.

4908
03:25:08,980 --> 03:25:09,540
Come here, come here!

4909
03:25:11,160 --> 03:25:11,440
Here!

4910
03:25:13,700 --> 03:25:14,000
Here.

4911
03:25:14,880 --> 03:25:15,600
Careful, Ditto.

4912
03:25:20,170 --> 03:25:21,450
Yeah, don't let them push up.

4913
03:25:21,710 --> 03:25:22,310
Yeah, hold that away.

4914
03:25:23,370 --> 03:25:24,410
Just make force...

4915
03:25:24,410 --> 03:25:26,250
Well, I won't force them to go this way.

4916
03:25:28,230 --> 03:25:29,410
That's the one guy here.

4917
03:25:29,410 --> 03:25:30,190
Yeah, I'm looking at the portal.

4918
03:25:30,250 --> 03:25:31,650
I'm looking at the portal so they don't push.

4919
03:25:32,550 --> 03:25:33,490
Y'all up, guys?

4920
03:25:34,570 --> 03:25:35,010
Okay.

4921
03:25:35,030 --> 03:25:36,190
One, one keg.

4922
03:25:37,130 --> 03:25:37,630
Can I zoom?

4923
03:25:37,890 --> 03:25:38,070
Yeah.

4924
03:25:38,490 --> 03:25:38,890
Can you scan?

4925
03:25:39,070 --> 03:25:41,750

Scan?

5111
03:34:31,720 --> 03:34:32,980
Maybe they're leaving.

5112
03:34:33,640 --> 03:34:34,540
Why is she scanned?

5113
03:34:35,340 --> 03:34:36,500

03:35:11,980 --> 03:35:13,560
We can redeploy.

5138
03:35:14,120 --> 03:35:14,560

You have to heal.

5206
03:37:57,000 --> 03:37:57,360

5207
03:37:57,520 --> 03:37:59,280

03:38:09,640 --> 03:38:10,220
I'm trying to cover.

5214
03:38:12,740 --> 03:38:14,940
I'm trying to make sure they don't run to us.

5215
03:38:15,060 --> 03:38:16,940
I want them to go low ground.

5216
03:38:16,960 --> 03:38:18,860
Wait, oh my god!

I'm making sure this team...

5219
03:38:24,300 --> 03:38:26,780
We can't get inside first if we...

5220
03:38:26,780 --> 03:38:28,140
I think we don't have...

5221
03:38:28,140 --> 03:38:28,660
Careful?

5222
03:38:29,940 --> 03:38:30,760

5223
03:38:31,520 --> 03:38:32,600

I'm okay!

5231
03:38:51,040 --> 03:38:52,300
Kill, kill, kill, kill!

5232
03:38:53,080 --> 03:38:54,320
I walked backwards!

5233
03:38:55,180 --> 03:38:55,800
It's okay.

5234
03:38:56,120 --> 03:38:58,360
I'm okay, I'm okay.

5235
03:38:59,120 --> 03:39:02,380
Nothing bad has happened to me.

5236
03:39:05,940 --> 03:39:06,960
It's okay.

5237
03:39:07,080 --> 03:39:09,520
They pushed me, they pushed me, they pushed me.

5238
03:39:09,540 --> 03:39:10,300
Come to me, Delir.

5239
03:39:10,500 --> 03:39:10,960
I'm gonna smoke.

5240
03:39:11,080 --> 03:39:11,540
I'm gonna smoke you.

5241
03:39:11,600 --> 03:39:11,940
I can't.

5242
03:39:12,020 --> 03:39:12,660
Okay, okay, okay.

5243
03:39:13,160 --> 03:39:13,600
Okay, okay.

5244
03:39:13,600 --> 03:39:14,220
I'm gonna try to smoke you.

5245
03:39:14,320 --> 03:39:15,720
Oh, we can't help you, actually.

5246
03:39:15,920 --> 03:39:17,440
No, you're way too far.

5247
03:39:17,520 --> 03:39:19,720
Oh, that's another team!

5248
03:39:19,940 --> 03:39:20,840
That's so unlucky.

5249
03:39:21,140 --> 03:39:22,360
You're way too far from us.

5250
03:39:23,260 --> 03:39:23,640
Yes.

5251
03:39:24,980 --> 03:39:29,800
Yeah, I fell down and- I'm trying to get to you, but how?

5252
03:39:31,320 --> 03:39:32,640
Oh, they have E1-8.

5253
03:39:32,920 --> 03:39:33,180
Careful.

5254
03:39:33,460 --> 03:39:34,220
Yeah, I'm batting.

5255
03:39:34,800 --> 03:39:35,040
Wait.

5256
03:39:35,380 --> 03:39:35,660
Okay.

5257
03:39:36,880 --> 03:39:37,680
Do you have redeploy?

5258
03:39:38,140 --> 03:39:39,320
What the- Yeah, redeploy, right?

5259
03:39:44,020 --> 03:39:45,540
Okay, I want back up.

5260
03:39:45,640 --> 03:39:46,520
I want to back up.

5261
03:39:46,560 --> 03:39:47,400
They're gonna walk up.

5262
03:39:47,660 --> 03:39:48,200
There's three.

5263
03:39:48,220 --> 03:39:48,760
Okay, okay, okay.

5264
03:39:52,940 --> 03:39:53,780
Okay, okay.

5265
03:39:54,420 --> 03:39:54,700
Yeah.

5266
03:39:56,260 --> 03:39:57,000
That's them.

5267
03:39:58,400 --> 03:39:59,660
Oh, behind us.

5268
03:40:01,020 --> 03:40:02,640
That's not good for us.

5269
03:40:03,420 --> 03:40:04,300
They might push.

5270
03:40:04,360 --> 03:40:04,840
Yeah, they're pushing.

5271
03:40:04,960 --> 03:40:05,260
They're pushing.

5272
03:40:05,380 --> 03:40:05,960
Back up, back up.

5273
03:40:06,120 --> 03:40:06,780
Yeah, I might die.

5274
03:40:06,920 --> 03:40:08,000
Run, just run, just run.

5275
03:40:10,220 --> 03:40:11,180
Okay, okay.

5276
03:40:16,200 --> 03:40:17,160
I shouldn't...

5277
03:40:17,160 --> 03:40:17,740
No!

5278
03:40:19,400 --> 03:40:19,540
No!

5279
03:40:19,540 --> 03:40:19,960
I shouldn't!

5280
03:40:19,960 --> 03:40:20,100
No!

5281
03:40:20,100 --> 03:40:20,120
No!

5282
03:40:20,140 --> 03:40:20,800
Two team inside the arena for...

5283
03:40:20,800 --> 03:40:21,420
Three, three.

5284
03:40:22,260 --> 03:40:22,740
Three?

5285
03:40:23,760 --> 03:40:24,120
Three?

5286
03:40:24,520 --> 03:40:25,280
Oh my gosh.

5287
03:40:25,880 --> 03:40:26,360
Okay.

5288
03:40:28,120 --> 03:40:30,000
Goodbye, see you later.

5289
03:40:30,500 --> 03:40:30,980
Sayonara.

5290
03:40:33,680 --> 03:40:34,900
You can carve us.

5291

So we should go here.

5599
03:53:09,930 --> 03:53:11,250

03:53:49,990 --> 03:53:51,370
No, we can go stay up.

Yay!

5660
03:55:52,890 --> 03:55:55,630
I'm gonna make sure no team runs behind us.

5661
03:55:56,210 --> 03:55:56,630
Okay.

5662
03:55:57,070 --> 03:55:57,470

5664
03:55:58,970 --> 03:55:59,410
What?

5665
03:55:59,770 --> 03:56:00,470
One team.

5666
03:56:00,790 --> 03:56:01,050
One?

5667
03:56:01,570 --> 03:56:02,010
What?

5668
03:56:02,590 --> 03:56:02,910
What?

5669
03:56:03,090 --> 03:56:03,790
How do you change?

5670
03:56:04,370 --> 03:56:06,110
Okay, goodbye, diddo.

5671
03:56:06,750 --> 03:56:06,830
Goodbye.

5672
03:56:08,010 --> 03:56:09,190
Oh my god.

5673
03:56:10,010 --> 03:56:11,510
What the heck?

5674
03:56:13,570 --> 03:56:14,030
Okay.

5675
03:56:15,570 --> 03:56:17,010

5676
03:56:18,890 --> 03:56:19,890
Goodbye.

5677
03:56:24,610 --> 03:56:25,830
Let's see.

5678
03:56:25,910 --> 03:56:26,830
I'm trying to figure out.

5679
03:56:26,970 --> 03:56:27,890
It's a scene.

5680
03:56:29,750 --> 03:56:30,670
Goodbye.

5681
03:56:31,590 --> 03:56:32,810
It was camping.

5682
03:56:34,570 --> 03:56:37,370
Maybe you can grab my...

5683
03:56:38,390 --> 03:56:38,730
No.

5684
03:56:39,470 --> 03:56:39,630
No.

5685
03:56:39,630 --> 03:56:40,970
There is no way.

5686
03:56:41,610 --> 03:56:42,490
That's not good.

5687
03:56:42,890 --> 03:56:43,310
Yeah.

5688
03:56:44,110 --> 03:56:47,470
I don't think anybody can grab that.

5689
03:56:49,590 --> 03:56:50,810
Fuck this!

5690
03:56:51,130 --> 03:56:53,190

5691
03:56:53,950 --> 03:56:54,430
No.

5692
03:56:56,350 --> 03:56:58,270
You should have stayed with us.

5693
03:56:59,050 --> 03:56:59,770
We can't.

5694
03:56:59,950 --> 03:57:00,910
Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:57:00,950 --> 03:57:01,930

03:57:03,130 --> 03:57:04,250

03:57:04,370 --> 03:57:05,470

Okay, I didn't realize you have respawn.

One team helped Duel.

Why did you kill him?

5910
04:06:22,540 --> 04:06:26,020

5912

04:06:30,740 --> 04:06:31,400

04:06:44,830 --> 04:06:46,230
They don't fight each other.

5922
04:06:46,250 --> 04:06:46,690
Why?

5923
04:06:47,130 --> 04:06:47,130

04:33:22,300 --> 04:33:23,200
Wait, I thought there were two.

6511
04:33:23,860 --> 04:33:25,400
I don't know another team.

6512
04:33:25,920 --> 04:33:27,980
Maybe they went to epic center.

6513
04:33:28,400 --> 04:33:29,020
Maybe, yeah.

6514
04:33:30,400 --> 04:33:31,060
Do you have loot?

6515
04:33:32,400 --> 04:33:32,680

04:33:37,080 --> 04:33:38,180
Wait, is that a window?

6520
04:33:38,400 --> 04:33:38,940
I can't tell.

6521
04:33:40,240 --> 04:33:41,260
That's a window.

6522
04:33:42,340 --> 04:33:43,420
I can't tell!

6523
04:33:43,860 --> 04:33:45,180
It's so far!

6524
04:33:45,960 --> 04:33:47,520
I don't have a scope!

6525
04:33:49,080 --> 04:33:50,660
Okay, I can go up.

6526
04:33:51,560 --> 04:33:51,920
Let's do it.

6527
04:33:51,940 --> 04:33:52,500
Are we gonna go?

6528
04:33:53,000 --> 04:33:53,460
Yes.

6529
04:33:54,380 --> 04:33:54,800
Okay.

6530
04:33:55,820 --> 04:33:57,780
If we kill them, we win, right?

6531
04:33:59,020 --> 04:33:59,760
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

6532
04:33:59,940 --> 04:34:01,800
One, two here, two here, two here, two here.

6533
04:34:02,200 --> 04:34:03,060
I think I'm gonna die.

6534
04:34:03,800 --> 04:34:04,500
What are you doing?

6535
04:34:04,720 --> 04:34:05,520
Because they're gonna be me.

6536
04:34:05,700 --> 04:34:07,280
Why are you by yourself?

6537
04:34:08,420 --> 04:34:10,760
Okay, no, I'm gonna die first, I guess!

6538
04:34:13,400 --> 04:34:14,720
Oh, did I die?

6539
04:34:15,360 --> 04:34:15,940
I'm gonna die!

6540
04:34:23,340 --> 04:34:24,440
We splurged alone.

6541
04:34:25,480 --> 04:34:26,420
So I think...

6542
04:34:27,000 --> 04:34:28,140
I think maybe we run.

6543
04:34:29,000 --> 04:34:29,680
I think...

6544
04:34:30,300 --> 04:34:32,200
There's another team behind us!

6545
04:34:36,100 --> 04:34:39,680

I believe.

6555
04:35:56,360 --> 04:35:57,320
There's no way.

6556
04:35:57,780 --> 04:35:58,260
There's no way.

6557
04:35:58,300 --> 04:36:00,020
Three times in a row, unlucky?

6558
04:36:00,340 --> 04:36:01,140
There's no way.

6559
04:36:02,160 --> 04:36:03,440
Yes, there's no way.

6560
04:36:03,480 --> 04:36:04,240
There's no way.

6561
04:36:05,320 --> 04:36:06,600
Three times.

6562
04:36:06,720 --> 04:36:06,720

What the fuck?

6861
04:48:45,670 --> 04:48:46,650

Then we can fight this.

6870
04:48:56,340 --> 04:48:57,740
I want to just back up.

6871
04:48:58,980 --> 04:48:59,300
Okay.

6872
04:48:59,320 --> 04:49:00,700

6874
04:49:02,080 --> 04:49:03,360
They should not have...

6875
04:49:03,360 --> 04:49:05,900
They don't have enough, like, heals to fight us.

6876
04:49:06,540 --> 04:49:08,220

6878
04:49:13,500 --> 04:49:13,660

6880
04:49:19,320 --> 04:49:21,300
Yeah, I'll give you...

6881

6883
04:49:24,940 --> 04:49:27,500
Yeah, but they should have heals, because I cracked them so
many times.

6884
04:49:29,320 --> 04:49:31,140
No way they found, like, enough shield cells.

6885
04:49:31,160 --> 04:49:32,060

6886
04:49:32,320 --> 04:49:32,500

Jump to me.

6937
04:51:36,140 --> 04:51:36,660
I can cue you.

6938
04:51:41,680 --> 04:51:43,700
I have cells so you can jump to me.

6939
04:51:45,700 --> 04:51:47,060
Oh, he's so low.

6940
04:51:47,200 --> 04:51:47,700
He jumped to me.

6941
04:51:47,720 --> 04:51:48,000
Jump to me.

6942
04:51:48,220 --> 04:51:48,640
You're low.

6943
04:51:48,960 --> 04:51:49,840
You guys don't have heals.

6944
04:51:50,920 --> 04:51:53,380
I have a... I have a... I have a...

6945
04:51:53,380 --> 04:51:55,000
Oh, I have to heal.

6946
04:51:55,680 --> 04:51:57,860
We're all really poor in heals right now.

6947
04:52:00,460 --> 04:52:01,240
No cell.

6948
04:52:01,300 --> 04:52:02,360
Bro, no cell here.

6949
04:52:03,840 --> 04:52:04,980
I dropped two for you.

6950
04:52:06,200 --> 04:52:07,080
You're getting...

6951
04:52:10,510 --> 04:52:11,850
I have Q and three.

6952
04:52:12,070 --> 04:52:12,950
Oh, he's so...

6953
04:52:12,970 --> 04:52:14,970
They're all so low.

6954
04:52:18,650 --> 04:52:19,990
Oh, I can't give you the cue.

6955
04:52:21,030 --> 04:52:22,850
There's a guy right here.

6956
04:52:23,990 --> 04:52:25,630
Oh, no, Ditto, your spider's out.

6957
04:52:25,870 --> 04:52:26,750
Ditto, no!

6958
04:52:27,890 --> 04:52:29,370
Oh, he's so lazy!

6959
04:52:29,950 --> 04:52:33,810
Leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave,
leave, leave, leave.

6960
04:52:34,370 --> 04:52:36,190
That's three people!

6961
04:52:37,250 --> 04:52:37,850
That's...

6962
04:52:38,410 --> 04:52:40,090
That was three people!

6963
04:52:40,390 --> 04:52:41,110
You're crazy!

6964
04:52:43,610 --> 04:52:44,890
You're crazy!

6965
04:52:46,570 --> 04:52:48,970
Oh, I don't have any...

6966
04:52:49,750 --> 04:52:50,470
A magazine!

6967
04:52:51,510 --> 04:52:53,170
Oh my god, you're insane.

6968
04:52:53,790 --> 04:52:54,970
You try to...

6969
04:52:54,970 --> 04:52:56,230
You try to win.

6970
04:52:56,230 --> 04:52:57,510
No, he's...

6971
04:52:57,510 --> 04:53:03,990
Oh my god, Uto is like so poor right now.

6972
04:53:04,690 --> 04:53:04,950
Here.

6973
04:53:05,510 --> 04:53:05,670
Here.

6974
04:53:09,490 --> 04:53:10,330
She's sorry.

6975
04:53:10,330 --> 04:53:12,090
They come, they come, they come, they come.

6976
04:53:12,090 --> 04:53:13,150
Are you fucking...

6977
04:53:13,150 --> 04:53:14,430
Oh my god!

6978
04:53:14,730 --> 04:53:16,030
They're redeployed!

6979
04:53:19,790 --> 04:53:20,990
They're redeployed!

6980
04:53:21,710 --> 04:53:22,430
Holy shit.

6981
04:53:22,970 --> 04:53:24,590
We don't have another redeployed though.

6982
04:53:26,650 --> 04:53:29,590
Oh, and I dropped my Phoenix kit for you too.

6983
04:53:30,290 --> 04:53:33,170
I can't even craft you because they're chasing us.

6984
04:53:34,970 --> 04:53:36,990
Okay, there's only one thing I can do.

6985
04:53:37,230 --> 04:53:38,010
And it's this.

6986
04:53:38,910 --> 04:53:39,410
Boom.

6987
04:53:39,970 --> 04:53:41,410
I don't know if it'll hit.

6988
04:53:44,610 --> 04:53:47,630
Okay, the best, okay.

6989
04:53:48,410 --> 04:53:50,670
Oh, I mean, I mean, me, me, me, me.

6990
04:53:50,750 --> 04:53:51,670
Are you dead slide?

6991
04:53:52,110 --> 04:53:52,770
Ah, dead slide.

6992
04:53:54,170 --> 04:53:56,150
Go, don't live for us!

6993
04:53:56,810 --> 04:53:57,170
Live!

6994
04:53:58,090 --> 04:53:59,170
Oh, wait, no, don't come to me.

6995
04:53:59,930 --> 04:54:00,230
No!

6996
04:54:03,230 --> 04:54:04,710
I said live.

6997
04:54:05,270 --> 04:54:06,750
I said...

6998
04:54:06,750 --> 04:54:09,810
No, I got dead slide again.

6999
04:54:10,870 --> 04:54:12,070
Jesus Christ.

7000
04:54:12,090 --> 04:54:16,790
I don't know.

7001
04:54:17,110 --> 04:54:18,310
I said live.

7002
04:54:19,810 --> 04:54:21,150
What happened to living?

7003
04:54:22,450 --> 04:54:24,130
You can save us, right?

7004
04:54:24,930 --> 04:54:25,910
I don't know.

7005
04:54:27,050 --> 04:54:31,750
This doesn't look very hopeful right now.

7006
04:54:33,870 --> 04:54:38,190
I literally have not a lot of resources.

7007
04:54:41,700 --> 04:54:42,580
Okay.

7008
04:54:42,580 --> 04:54:44,580
You can do it.

7009
04:54:44,600 --> 04:54:45,020
Okay.

7010
04:54:45,340 --> 04:54:46,120
You can do it.

7011
04:54:46,200 --> 04:54:46,500
Okay.

7012
04:54:53,310 --> 04:54:54,010
Alright.

7013
04:54:55,470 --> 04:54:56,780
You can do it.

7014
04:54:57,430 --> 04:54:57,750
Alright.

7015
04:54:58,730 --> 04:54:59,710
You can't do it.

7016
04:55:00,050 --> 04:55:02,090
You think they're gonna camp me?

7017
04:55:02,350 --> 04:55:03,850
Let's find out.

7018
04:55:05,950 --> 04:55:06,390
Whoa.

7019
04:55:06,670 --> 04:55:07,370
Maybe they are.

7020
04:55:07,750 --> 04:55:12,290
I think they are still close to us.

7021
04:55:13,990 --> 04:55:14,690
Okay.

7022
04:55:14,710 --> 04:55:18,710
Alright, it's either I do this or I die, so...

7023
04:55:19,770 --> 04:55:21,710
Oh, here we go.

7024
04:55:23,650 --> 04:55:24,530
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

7025
04:55:25,650 --> 04:55:27,110
First step, first step, first step.

7026
04:55:27,770 --> 04:55:29,250
Well, this is my last heal.

7027
04:55:38,190 --> 04:55:39,750
I know, I forgot.

7028
04:55:41,070 --> 04:55:41,190
What?

7029
04:55:45,490 --> 04:55:47,070
How did you forgot?

7030
04:55:48,770 --> 04:55:50,150
You said footsteps!

7031
04:55:50,930 --> 04:55:52,570
So I panicked!

7032
04:55:54,950 --> 04:55:56,610
I was like, I heard shit!

7033
04:55:56,630 --> 04:55:57,190
I heard something!

7034
04:55:58,830 --> 04:55:59,190
Yeah.

7035
04:56:00,190 --> 04:56:01,610
Yeah, and then I freaked out.

7036
04:56:01,870 --> 04:56:01,870
They're gone.

7037
04:56:01,970 --> 04:56:03,170
They're gone.

7038
04:56:03,390 --> 04:56:03,710
Alright.

7039
04:56:05,910 --> 04:56:07,310
Oh, nice signage.

7040
04:56:07,810 --> 04:56:08,210
One.

7041
04:56:13,990 --> 04:56:15,550
Better than nothing?

7042
04:56:15,810 --> 04:56:16,410
That's true.

7043
04:56:16,910 --> 04:56:17,390
That's true.

7044
04:56:17,470 --> 04:56:17,710
Alright.

7045
04:56:18,770 --> 04:56:19,750
Okay, this is up here.

7046
04:56:20,130 --> 04:56:21,670
Okay, look how far.

7047
04:56:22,210 --> 04:56:24,550
Oh my god, I think we're gonna die.

7048
04:56:24,750 --> 04:56:25,290
We're gonna die.

7049
04:56:25,450 --> 04:56:26,190
We're gonna die in zone.

7050
04:56:26,390 --> 04:56:27,550
We're gonna die in zone.

7051
04:56:29,150 --> 04:56:32,110
Let me, we are not, we are not.

7052
04:56:32,350 --> 04:56:33,630
Believe, okay, okay.

7053
04:56:33,830 --> 04:56:35,090
We will not die in zone.

7054
04:56:35,390 --> 04:56:36,690
We will not.

7055
04:56:37,310 --> 04:56:38,830
We want, we want.

7056
04:56:38,990 --> 04:56:41,530
Look how far the zone is, what do you mean?

7057
04:56:41,830 --> 04:56:42,350
It's okay.

7058
04:56:42,490 --> 04:56:43,350
I'm a plus fighter.

7059
04:56:45,050 --> 04:56:46,030
You're, you're rapid.

7060
04:56:46,610 --> 04:56:46,830
I have a squad.

7061
04:56:46,830 --> 04:56:47,670
Oh

04:57:49,110 --> 04:57:50,150
I can smell it too.

7067
04:57:50,850 --> 04:57:52,610
I feel it right now.

7068
04:57:53,330 --> 04:57:53,690
Okay.

7069
04:57:55,030 --> 04:57:55,870
We will see.

7070
04:57:56,770 --> 04:57:57,510
Okay, I'm seeing.

7071
04:57:58,670 --> 04:57:59,410
I'm seeing.

7072
04:58:00,130 --> 04:58:02,590
No, they're finding each other that...

7073
04:58:02,590 --> 04:58:03,970
They have no time for us.

7074
04:58:04,150 --> 04:58:05,990
They have no time for us.

7075
04:58:08,150 --> 04:58:10,690
Maybe we can get into that building.

7076
04:58:11,310 --> 04:58:11,770
Alright.

7077
04:58:13,130 --> 04:58:13,770
Let's go.

7078
04:58:14,330 --> 04:58:16,550
I swear to God if...

7079
04:58:16,830 --> 04:58:18,310
I swear to guy.

7080
04:58:22,150 --> 04:58:23,830
This has been...

7081
04:58:24,390 --> 04:58:26,710
This has been a very scuffed game.

7082
04:58:29,010 --> 04:58:30,010
Oh, we got...

7083
04:58:30,010 --> 04:58:31,210
We got inside the lane.

7084
04:58:33,330 --> 04:58:34,150
Oh my god.

7085
04:58:34,390 --> 04:58:35,810
One team, one team so close.

7086
04:58:37,110 --> 04:58:39,270
Okay, I'm trying to grab...

7087
04:58:39,270 --> 04:58:39,510
Hammer point!

7088
04:58:40,290 --> 04:58:40,910
Hammer point!

7089
04:58:41,150 --> 04:58:42,030
One more point!

7090
04:58:42,190 --> 04:58:45,770
Okay, I don't think I should bring it to Hammer point.

7091
04:58:46,830 --> 04:58:47,750
You should get it.

7092
04:58:47,850 --> 04:58:48,950
You should get it.

7093
04:58:48,950 --> 04:58:49,990
I don't help.

7094
04:58:50,450 --> 04:58:51,250
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

7095
04:58:52,010 --> 04:58:52,690
Okay, I'm gonna...

7096
04:58:52,690 --> 04:58:53,650
Okay, I'll be taking it first.

7097
04:58:53,830 --> 04:58:55,430
Yeah, yeah, just take it, hold on to it.

7098
04:58:55,670 --> 04:58:56,450
Okay, okay, okay.

7099
04:58:58,130 --> 04:58:58,610
Okay.

7100
04:58:59,850 --> 04:59:00,710
I'm going to you.

7101
04:59:01,770 --> 04:59:04,270
There's so many people fighting around us, I'm so scared.

7102
04:59:05,930 --> 04:59:06,410
Oh!

7103
04:59:06,890 --> 04:59:07,730
I'm gonna craft.

7104
04:59:09,010 --> 04:59:09,490
Oh!

7105
04:59:09,850 --> 04:59:11,030
Nice, nice.

7106
04:59:11,470 --> 04:59:12,310
I'll craft too.

7107
04:59:12,430 --> 04:59:13,350
We have craft.

7108
04:59:13,870 --> 04:59:14,630
You can!

7109
04:59:15,490 --> 04:59:16,130
You can?

7110
04:59:17,330 --> 04:59:18,330
There we go.

7111
04:59:18,490 --> 04:59:19,870
How can you carve it?

7112
04:59:20,090 --> 04:59:21,250
You carved banner once.

7113
04:59:21,550 --> 04:59:24,490
No, each machine is one.

7114
04:59:25,450 --> 04:59:25,970
Oh, really?

7115
04:59:26,030 --> 04:59:26,490
Yeah, yeah.

7116
04:59:26,810 --> 04:59:28,070
It's not one whole game.

7117
04:59:29,230 --> 04:59:30,230
Wait, you didn't know?

7118
04:59:30,970 --> 04:59:31,730

Okay, I will ping you if I fall on it.

7300
05:09:41,430 --> 05:09:42,270
30-30.

7301
05:09:43,350 --> 05:09:44,150
Does anyone need bats?

7302
05:09:44,270 --> 05:09:44,690
I have six.

7303
05:09:45,950 --> 05:09:46,710
I have two.

7304
05:09:47,070 --> 05:09:47,270
Here.

7305
05:09:47,750 --> 05:09:49,010
Uh, whoops, that's not it.

7306
05:09:50,370 --> 05:09:51,130
I dropped two?

7307
05:09:51,230 --> 05:09:52,090
Four bats.

7308
05:09:53,750 --> 05:09:55,750
Okay, I got it.

7309
05:09:57,410 --> 05:09:59,550
If anyone, um...

7310
05:10:00,950 --> 05:10:03,970
Um... I have... I want... I want scope.

7311
05:10:04,630 --> 05:10:04,630
Scope.

7312
05:10:04,870 --> 05:10:05,030
Yeah.

7313
05:10:05,470 --> 05:10:07,510
Oh, I have scope, but it's my scope.

7314
05:10:07,790 --> 05:10:08,250
Oh, let me see.

7315
05:10:09,030 --> 05:10:09,970
Yeah, okay.

7316
05:10:10,490 --> 05:10:11,850
You found one, see me.

7317
05:10:12,870 --> 05:10:16,170
I just wanted you guys... you to know.

7318
05:10:16,870 --> 05:10:17,370
Okay.

7319
05:10:17,850 --> 05:10:18,210
Okay.

7320
05:10:21,510 --> 05:10:22,530
Alright, Uto.

7321
05:10:23,530 --> 05:10:26,730
Uto, you're gonna kill... 10 people, okay?

7322
05:10:27,610 --> 05:10:28,330
10 people?

7323
05:10:28,430 --> 05:10:28,990
10 people.

7324
05:10:29,030 --> 05:10:29,670
Yes, yes.

7325
05:10:29,710 --> 05:10:30,810
You killed 10 people.

7326
05:10:30,810 --> 05:10:32,570
And then we win champion.

7327
05:10:33,370 --> 05:10:33,790
That's it.

7328
05:10:34,250 --> 05:10:35,190
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

7329
05:10:35,290 --> 05:10:36,190
I believe in you.

7330
05:10:37,270 --> 05:10:40,410
If you don't kill 10 people, I need midship.

7331
05:10:40,630 --> 05:10:41,550
I'll report you.

7332
05:10:42,710 --> 05:10:43,830
Okay, okay.

7333
05:10:45,750 --> 05:10:49,530
I'll report you for creeping my game.

7334
05:10:50,430 --> 05:10:53,230
Oh my gosh.

7335
05:10:53,950 --> 05:10:56,230
You don't want me to report you.

7336
05:10:58,990 --> 05:11:00,530
There's more of us here.

7337
05:11:01,490 --> 05:11:02,510
A lot.

7338
05:11:02,970 --> 05:11:04,150
I don't need to get it.

7339
05:11:05,470 --> 05:11:05,770
Hi.

7340
05:11:07,550 --> 05:11:09,070
Okay, each kill you get?

7341
05:11:11,050 --> 05:11:11,610
Each kill?

7342
05:11:12,710 --> 05:11:13,330
You get?

7343
05:11:13,990 --> 05:11:17,190
You can have one bite of food.

7344
05:11:19,630 --> 05:11:20,050
Really?

7345
05:11:20,970 --> 05:11:21,470
Like, yay!

7346
05:11:22,190 --> 05:11:25,250
What is this game?

7347
05:11:25,330 --> 05:11:27,130
It's like a dog.

7348
05:11:27,530 --> 05:11:29,270
Like, you know, you're training a dog?

7349
05:11:29,930 --> 05:11:30,410
No!

7350
05:11:30,810 --> 05:11:32,890
Don't you like it though?

7351
05:11:33,270 --> 05:11:34,990
I would die.

7352
05:11:35,070 --> 05:11:36,090
I would die.

7353
05:11:36,530 --> 05:11:38,170
How can she?

7354
05:11:39,490 --> 05:11:41,130
Just make a paint.

7355
05:11:41,130 --> 05:11:41,950
Just make a paint.

7356
05:11:43,110 --> 05:11:43,430
What?

7357
05:11:43,710 --> 05:11:44,650
Don't you want to bite?

7358
05:11:48,370 --> 05:11:49,930
Oh my god.

7359
05:11:51,010 --> 05:11:51,890
Here's a scope.

7360
05:11:52,730 --> 05:11:54,730
It's called positive reinforcement.

7361
05:11:55,950 --> 05:11:56,750
Oh my god.

7362
05:11:58,330 --> 05:11:59,830
I'm rewarding her.

7363
05:11:59,990 --> 05:12:00,790
She gets to eat.

7364
05:12:01,450 --> 05:12:02,030
What?

7365
05:12:02,690 --> 05:12:03,270
What?

7366
05:12:07,150 --> 05:12:07,570
What was that?

7367
05:12:08,390 --> 05:12:10,050
I heard a slide.

7368
05:12:10,310 --> 05:12:10,770
In here.

7369
05:12:17,770 --> 05:12:18,870
Kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss.

7370
05:12:19,590 --> 05:12:20,710
I'm gonna go.

7371
05:12:20,930 --> 05:12:21,750
I'm pushing.

7372
05:12:22,110 --> 05:12:22,370
Okay.

7373
05:12:22,890 --> 05:12:24,310
I'm right behind you.

7374
05:12:25,890 --> 05:12:27,470
Go, it's a go.

7375
05:12:28,010 --> 05:12:28,750
Go, it's a go.

7376
05:12:28,790 --> 05:12:28,850
Okay.

7377
05:12:29,510 --> 05:12:29,570
Go.

7378
05:12:29,830 --> 05:12:29,870
Go.

7379
05:12:30,350 --> 05:12:30,930
Okay.

7380
05:12:41,610 --> 05:12:43,170
Wait, where did you?

7381
05:12:44,630 --> 05:12:45,910
Oh, here, I love here, I love here.

7382
05:12:46,370 --> 05:12:46,710
Oh, here?

7383
05:12:47,090 --> 05:12:47,090
Okay.

7384
05:12:48,450 --> 05:12:49,190
Maybe this guy?

7385
05:12:50,070 --> 05:12:50,550
See?

7386
05:12:50,850 --> 05:12:51,150
Scan?

7387
05:12:51,410 --> 05:12:51,750
No.

7388
05:12:52,730 --> 05:12:54,150
Where the fuck did they go?

7389
05:12:56,690 --> 05:12:58,510
I heard, I heard, I heard something.

7390
05:12:58,670 --> 05:12:59,230
I heard something.

7391
05:12:59,590 --> 05:12:59,790
Oh, here.

7392
05:13:00,870 --> 05:13:02,950
Okay, but remember last time you heard something?

7393
05:13:05,490 --> 05:13:06,830
I really heard something!

7394
05:13:07,210 --> 05:13:08,990
Okay, okay, okay, with the scan.

7395
05:13:09,750 --> 05:13:10,750
With the scan.

7396
05:13:13,150 --> 05:13:15,330
Yeah, you heard something.

7397
05:13:17,410 --> 05:13:19,010
There's people here.

7398
05:13:20,090 --> 05:13:23,510
Oh, in front of me, in front of me, in front of me.

7399
05:13:23,790 --> 05:13:24,750
Go, go, go, go.

7400
05:13:27,290 --> 05:13:27,630
Wow!

7401
05:13:28,090 --> 05:13:32,370
Here in front, two teams, two teams, two teams.

7402
05:13:32,570 --> 05:13:36,190
What the fuck is going on?

7403
05:13:40,410 --> 05:13:41,390
Okay, I got one.

7404
05:13:42,130 --> 05:13:42,650
Yeah.

7405
05:13:45,690 --> 05:13:47,110
Are they finding each other?

7406
05:13:47,690 --> 05:13:48,050
Hey.

7407
05:13:48,950 --> 05:13:49,650
Here they are.

7408
05:13:49,830 --> 05:13:51,550
There's like a team in that building.

7409
05:13:52,250 --> 05:13:52,430
Okay.

7410
05:13:52,590 --> 05:13:53,310
I will scan.

7411
05:13:53,970 --> 05:13:54,270
Okay.

7412
05:14:00,170 --> 05:14:00,410
Why?

7413
05:14:01,550 --> 05:14:03,010
They move so fast.

7414
05:14:04,090 --> 05:14:04,330
They move so fast.

7415
05:14:04,330 --> 05:14:04,490
They move so fast.

7416
05:14:04,530 --> 05:14:04,810
Oh wait.

7417
05:14:05,130 --> 05:14:05,230
They move so fast.

7418
05:14:05,490 --> 05:14:05,910
Wow!

7419
05:14:06,230 --> 05:14:07,730
That's a different team.

7420
05:14:08,310 --> 05:14:08,830
I'm just gonna...

7421
05:14:09,190 --> 05:14:11,130
I'm still like holding on to like...

7422
05:14:12,690 --> 05:14:13,170
Yeah.

7423
05:14:13,310 --> 05:14:20,130
I remember you heard something, Ditto.

7424
05:14:22,730 --> 05:14:23,990
Over there, over there, over there.

7425
05:14:24,230 --> 05:14:25,070
Holyo, Holyo.

7426
05:14:25,350 --> 05:14:25,690
Cake!

7427
05:14:26,330 --> 05:14:26,590
Yeah.

7428
05:14:27,390 --> 05:14:29,070
I'm helping you.

7429
05:14:29,270 --> 05:14:29,490
Nice.

7430
05:14:29,630 --> 05:14:31,050
High ground, they're high ground now.

7431
05:14:31,410 --> 05:14:32,050
I'm gonna come to you.

7432
05:14:32,970 --> 05:14:34,510
There's people in front, there's people here.

7433
05:14:36,210 --> 05:14:38,070
Okay, I'm gonna scan next building.

7434
05:14:38,410 --> 05:14:39,570
No one in next building.

7435
05:14:39,810 --> 05:14:40,410
Train tracks.

7436
05:14:40,910 --> 05:14:41,930
I see people in train.

7437
05:14:43,170 --> 05:14:45,610
Not chain, uh, steamer, steamer building.

7438
05:14:47,470 --> 05:14:47,890
Okay.

7439
05:14:48,450 --> 05:14:49,210
Steamer building.

7440
05:14:52,950 --> 05:14:53,510
Whoa!

7441
05:14:54,170 --> 05:14:55,450
What the fuck is wrong with you?

7442
05:14:57,310 --> 05:14:58,590
What the fuck?

7443
05:14:58,770 --> 05:14:59,390
What the fuck?

7444
05:14:59,610 --> 05:15:01,710
Yeah, he fucked me up.

7445
05:15:03,370 --> 05:15:03,830
Oh.

7446
05:15:05,550 --> 05:15:06,950
All right, I need a heal.

7447
05:15:07,070 --> 05:15:07,710
Is that a sniper?

7448
05:15:08,310 --> 05:15:09,110
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

7449
05:15:09,670 --> 05:15:11,710
Uh, sniper and uh, 30, 30.

7450
05:15:17,050 --> 05:15:17,930
They're not...

7451
05:15:17,930 --> 05:15:21,390
This team really wants to kill me.

7452
05:15:22,410 --> 05:15:23,570
I'm coming over to you guys.

7453
05:15:23,970 --> 05:15:23,970
Behind?

7454
05:15:24,190 --> 05:15:24,550
Behind?

7455
05:15:24,910 --> 05:15:25,290
Yeah, behind.

7456
05:15:25,490 --> 05:15:27,350
Okay, I'm going to... I'm going to you, Ditto.

7457
05:15:28,130 --> 05:15:28,410
Okay.

7458
05:15:28,570 --> 05:15:29,690
I'm good, I'm good.

7459
05:15:36,370 --> 05:15:37,210
Oh yeah, oh yeah.

7460
05:15:38,250 --> 05:15:39,730
Behind the two... two teams.

7461
05:15:40,210 --> 05:15:40,450
Behind me.

7462
05:15:41,470 --> 05:15:43,390
What a fight with my aim.

7463
05:15:45,230 --> 05:15:46,070
There's like a...

7464
05:15:46,610 --> 05:15:47,830
I'm gonna...

7465
05:15:47,930 --> 05:15:51,170
They're like all so far, they're so far.

7466
05:15:51,430 --> 05:15:51,890
Yeah.

7467
05:15:54,910 --> 05:15:56,890
Everybody's just running away from each other.

7468
05:15:59,150 --> 05:16:00,570
So we can't really do anything.

7469
05:16:01,590 --> 05:16:01,730
Yeah.

7470
05:16:02,750 --> 05:16:03,970
They keep running.

7471
05:16:04,890 --> 05:16:06,270
They're all so scared.

7472
05:16:10,040 --> 05:16:11,160
Come on!

7473
05:16:11,420 --> 05:16:13,180
Leto needs to eat!

7474
05:16:15,140 --> 05:16:16,880
She needs to get a kill!

7475
05:16:17,180 --> 05:16:17,660
Hungry!

7476
05:16:17,900 --> 05:16:18,500
Hungry!

7477
05:16:22,400 --> 05:16:22,760
Okay.

7478
05:16:25,680 --> 05:16:26,400
There is...

7479
05:16:26,400 --> 05:16:27,820
They're all just poking each other.

7480
05:16:27,940 --> 05:16:28,860
They're not fighting at all.

7481
05:16:29,080 --> 05:16:29,440
Wait, wait.

7482
05:16:29,660 --> 05:16:30,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

7483
05:16:30,380 --> 05:16:31,060
Fight, fight, fight.

7484
05:16:31,280 --> 05:16:32,700
Maybe we can go to that party.

7485
05:16:32,720 --> 05:16:33,720

05:24:45,260 --> 05:24:45,900
We won.

7667
05:24:47,000 --> 05:24:47,460
Okay.

7668
05:24:48,420 --> 05:24:49,320
There's a...

7669
05:24:49,320 --> 05:24:51,020
I got...

7670
05:24:51,020 --> 05:24:52,480
Okay.

7671
05:24:56,990 --> 05:24:58,810
We did it!

7672
05:24:58,930 --> 05:24:59,350
Yay!

7673
05:25:00,690 --> 05:25:01,870
We'll run double heavy.

7674
05:25:03,430 --> 05:25:03,990
Nice.

7675
05:25:05,130 --> 05:25:06,910
I will just hemlock and rot.

7676
05:25:07,270 --> 05:25:09,130
Yeah, I'm using hemlock prowler.

7677
05:25:11,290 --> 05:25:12,230
How far?

7678
05:25:12,330 --> 05:25:13,570
Oh, it's not that far, the zone.

7679
05:25:13,990 --> 05:25:14,930
It's not that far, yeah.

7680
05:25:15,050 --> 05:25:15,690
Yeah, yeah.

7681
05:25:15,870 --> 05:25:16,770
Look how he's there.

7682
05:25:17,530 --> 05:25:18,830
Oh, let me find Repeater.

7683
05:25:19,250 --> 05:25:21,150
Oh, they're reviving us, guys!

7684
05:25:21,530 --> 05:25:21,870
They are?

7685
05:25:22,490 --> 05:25:24,510
Oh, I'm too lazy.

7686
05:25:24,890 --> 05:25:25,590
They can live.

7687
05:25:26,250 --> 05:25:27,050
Let's go.

7688
05:25:28,110 --> 05:25:28,630
Yay!

7689
05:25:33,650 --> 05:25:34,170
Yay!

7690
05:25:35,390 --> 05:25:36,890
Oh, this is looted.

7691
05:25:38,590 --> 05:25:39,110
Okay.

7692
05:25:39,130 --> 05:25:40,190
Just load it.

7693
05:25:40,210 --> 05:25:40,470
Yeah.

7694
05:25:40,470 --> 05:25:42,270
I heard going up the armor.

7695
05:25:42,890 --> 05:25:43,330
Evo.

7696
05:25:44,270 --> 05:25:46,210
Oh yeah, Uta's still a white armor.

7697
05:25:48,270 --> 05:25:50,430
So I was trying to find a 30.

7698
05:25:51,130 --> 05:25:51,450
Yay!

7699
05:25:51,570 --> 05:25:52,810
Oh, thank you.

7700
05:25:54,470 --> 05:25:55,330
You guys need bats?

7701
05:25:58,720 --> 05:25:59,680
You guys need bats?

7702
05:25:59,800 --> 05:26:00,600
I have four.

7703
05:26:00,860 --> 05:26:01,380
I have two.

7704
05:26:01,540 --> 05:26:02,020
I have two.

7705
05:26:02,080 --> 05:26:02,980
Look at how many...

7706
05:26:02,980 --> 05:26:03,360
Oh, here.

7707
05:26:03,560 --> 05:26:04,220
I'll give one.

7708
05:26:05,680 --> 05:26:06,360
Thank you.

7709
05:26:06,440 --> 05:26:09,900
I'm gonna go...

7710
05:26:10,980 --> 05:26:12,420
I'm gonna open this crate.

7711
05:26:18,890 --> 05:26:20,410
Oh, more bats.

7712
05:26:22,050 --> 05:26:23,550
But I should have it.

7713
05:26:23,890 --> 05:26:25,170
Yeah, yeah, there's two extra here.

7714
05:26:27,190 --> 05:26:28,430
And two back two.

7715
05:26:30,210 --> 05:26:31,690
I have me a scope.

7716
05:26:31,890 --> 05:26:32,810
Oh, yeah, I find a scope.

7717
05:26:34,410 --> 05:26:35,230
Um, which score?

7718
05:26:35,830 --> 05:26:37,870
Uh, two, three, or four.

7719
05:26:38,670 --> 05:26:39,210
Okay, okay.

7720
05:26:39,230 --> 05:26:40,050
Oh my god, hammer point!

7721
05:26:40,670 --> 05:26:43,290
Fuck, uh, I'm gonna grab it.

7722
05:26:43,310 --> 05:26:46,330
Light mag, light mag.

7723
05:26:46,870 --> 05:26:46,950
Yeah.

7724
05:26:48,450 --> 05:26:49,070
Okay.

7725
05:26:52,170 --> 05:26:54,950
Did you just get 20-20?

7726
05:26:55,270 --> 05:26:58,110
Yeah, but I need to try to find a...

7727
05:26:58,110 --> 05:26:58,310
Okay.

7728
05:26:58,730 --> 05:26:58,870
R-E.

7729
05:26:59,310 --> 05:26:59,970
R-E?

7730
05:27:00,210 --> 05:27:02,970
Yeah, I just wanted to put it on my gun first.

7731
05:27:06,950 --> 05:27:08,310
I need R-E.

7732
05:27:11,230 --> 05:27:11,770
Okay.

7733
05:27:12,250 --> 05:27:12,950
R-E.

7734
05:27:13,890 --> 05:27:14,230
Yeah.

7735
05:27:15,490 --> 05:27:15,910
Okay.

7736
05:27:15,930 --> 05:27:19,270
This is it.

7737
05:27:20,870 --> 05:27:21,650
This is it.

7738
05:27:23,110 --> 05:27:23,750
We believe.

7739
05:27:24,530 --> 05:27:25,230
We need RE.

7740
05:27:28,610 --> 05:27:28,910
Please.

7741
05:27:29,250 --> 05:27:30,250
Okay, let's go to Zone.

7742
05:27:31,010 --> 05:27:32,910
Let's just slowly head to Zone.

7743
05:27:34,310 --> 05:27:34,490
Alright.

7744
05:27:35,150 --> 05:27:35,510
Tito.

7745
05:27:36,630 --> 05:27:37,710
Where is Zone going to end?

7746
05:27:39,330 --> 05:27:40,030
Um, Skyhook.

7747
05:27:40,370 --> 05:27:41,570
Okay, let's go to Skyhook.

7748
05:27:42,130 --> 05:27:42,890
Okay, okay.

7749
05:27:44,510 --> 05:27:45,910
Oh my god, I see your surroundings.

7750
05:27:45,930 --> 05:27:49,210
Oh, that's not good.

7751
05:27:53,010 --> 05:27:53,630
I believe.

7752
05:27:54,490 --> 05:27:56,150
We need to keep believing.

7753
05:27:56,810 --> 05:27:58,890
Oh, one team land there.

7754
05:27:59,010 --> 05:28:00,910
Define to Skyhook.

7755
05:28:01,170 --> 05:28:03,290
I mean, we could just walk, honestly.

7756
05:28:03,710 --> 05:28:04,030
Okay.

7757
05:28:05,230 --> 05:28:07,170
I don't think we need to redeploy.

7758
05:28:07,290 --> 05:28:08,190
We can just walk over.

7759
05:28:11,380 --> 05:28:12,680
I don't see them.

7760
05:28:17,370 --> 05:28:21,250
I bet Ditto you're going to run into a three-man and die.

7761
05:28:22,070 --> 05:28:24,790
Oh, I can't.

7762
05:28:25,850 --> 05:28:26,550
Okay.

7763
05:28:27,290 --> 05:28:27,710
Uto, Uto.

7764
05:28:28,350 --> 05:28:29,350
I mean, go in front.

7765
05:28:29,630 --> 05:28:29,950
Go in front.

7766
05:28:31,270 --> 05:28:32,030
No, no, no.

7767
05:28:32,490 --> 05:28:33,770
Uto goes in front.

7768
05:28:38,450 --> 05:28:40,090
Uto defends us.

7769
05:28:44,490 --> 05:28:45,630
I want to...

7770
05:28:45,630 --> 05:28:48,210
Is that...

7771
05:28:48,210 --> 05:28:49,030
I want that.

7772
05:28:49,550 --> 05:28:49,910
What?

7773
05:28:50,010 --> 05:28:50,430
You see someone?

7774
05:28:51,230 --> 05:28:51,730
No.

7775
05:28:52,370 --> 05:28:53,370
Armor, armor.

7776
05:28:53,630 --> 05:28:54,830
Oh, no, we don't need it.

7777
05:28:54,950 --> 05:28:55,530
We don't need it.

7778
05:28:55,550 --> 05:28:56,170
We don't need it.

7779
05:28:56,410 --> 05:28:56,470
Okay.

7780
05:28:56,810 --> 05:28:57,010
Yeah, yeah.

7781
05:28:57,190 --> 05:28:57,830
We're strong.

7782
05:28:58,990 --> 05:29:00,210
Okay, I believe you.

7783
05:29:00,630 --> 05:29:02,170
I, yeah, believe in me.

7784
05:29:03,370 --> 05:29:05,150
If we die, it's not my fault.

7785
05:29:05,390 --> 05:29:07,110
It's not my fault if we die.

7786
05:29:09,150 --> 05:29:09,490
Believe.

7787
05:29:10,930 --> 05:29:11,390
Gotta believe.

7788
05:29:11,470 --> 05:29:12,410
We just gotta keep believing.

7789
05:29:12,750 --> 05:29:15,370
The reason why we keep dying is because we stop believing.

7790
05:29:16,650 --> 05:29:17,530
I believe.

7791
05:29:17,970 --> 05:29:21,230
I, maybe I think I have never believed it at first.

7792
05:29:21,250 --> 05:29:22,310
You didn't believe?

7793
05:29:22,430 --> 05:29:24,290
What's wrong?

7794
05:29:25,330 --> 05:29:26,690
No, I'm leaving.

7795
05:29:27,270 --> 05:29:28,210
Okay, okay, okay.

7796
05:29:28,610 --> 05:29:30,150
Is this why we're still playing?

7797
05:29:30,590 --> 05:29:32,270
I feel like that's a pro team.

7798
05:29:32,630 --> 05:29:33,870
The Horizon Octane.

7799
05:29:35,570 --> 05:29:36,530
Because like...

7800
05:29:36,530 --> 05:29:38,730
Because usually pro teams...

7801
05:29:38,730 --> 05:29:40,430
Or like not pro team, but like...

7802
05:29:41,250 --> 05:29:42,150
Pred teams.

7803
05:29:42,150 --> 05:29:44,150
Pred teams, they put...

7804
05:29:44,650 --> 05:29:46,350
They put streamer mode.

7805
05:29:47,390 --> 05:29:47,390
Okay.

7806
05:29:47,550 --> 05:29:47,990

7807
05:29:48,090 --> 05:29:49,310

I got it.

7810
05:29:50,430 --> 05:29:50,670
I got it.

7811
05:29:50,730 --> 05:29:51,230
I found one.

7812
05:29:52,690 --> 05:30:04,270
majority of streamers put streamer mode on because they
don't want to get sniped i mean which is obvious whoa wait

Is Eva 8 good?

7816
05:30:25,410 --> 05:30:26,890
Yeah, Eva 8 is broken.

7817
05:30:27,370 --> 05:30:27,830
Ooh.

7818
05:30:29,150 --> 05:30:29,570
Okay.

7819
05:30:29,830 --> 05:30:31,750
Someone needs to get it, because it's actually strong.

7820
05:30:32,010 --> 05:30:33,150
Yeah, Eva 8 very strong.

7821
05:30:33,490 --> 05:30:33,670
Oh no!

7822
05:30:34,030 --> 05:30:35,010
Um, wait.

7823
05:30:35,390 --> 05:30:37,190
I think it's... It's taken.

7824
05:30:37,650 --> 05:30:37,870
What?

7825
05:30:38,130 --> 05:30:39,210
No, no, it's right here.

7826
05:30:39,930 --> 05:30:40,130
No.

7827
05:30:40,390 --> 05:30:41,630
It's in the box, right here.

7828
05:30:41,650 --> 05:30:42,750
There's a death box that I need.

7829
05:30:42,910 --> 05:30:43,830
Oh, this box?

7830
05:30:43,930 --> 05:30:44,130
Yeah.

7831
05:30:44,330 --> 05:30:44,650
Okay.

7832
05:30:44,790 --> 05:30:45,830
No one took it.

7833
05:30:48,650 --> 05:30:49,750
Oh my god.

7834
05:30:50,890 --> 05:30:51,350
Um...

7835
05:30:52,430 --> 05:30:53,390
First shot.

7836
05:30:54,930 --> 05:30:55,770
Okay, believe!

7837
05:30:56,290 --> 05:30:58,010
Why are you not believing, Tito?

7838
05:30:58,530 --> 05:30:59,390
Okay, believe, believe.

7839
05:30:59,530 --> 05:31:00,230
Okay, I'm believing.

7840
05:31:00,610 --> 05:31:01,150
Okay, good.

7841
05:31:01,250 --> 05:31:02,370
I'm used to flying now.

7842
05:31:02,630 --> 05:31:03,210
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

7843
05:31:03,530 --> 05:31:04,310
Keep believing!

7844
05:31:04,930 --> 05:31:05,570
Wait, they're resing.

7845
05:31:08,210 --> 05:31:09,710
Another team here too.

7846
05:31:09,970 --> 05:31:11,230
I think we can wait a little bit.

7847
05:31:11,550 --> 05:31:11,850
Yeah.

7848
05:31:12,470 --> 05:31:13,210
Team here.

7849
05:31:14,150 --> 05:31:14,550
Okay.

7850
05:31:15,030 --> 05:31:15,530
Yeah.

7851
05:31:17,050 --> 05:31:17,930
Oh, they're...

7852
05:31:17,930 --> 05:31:18,930
Someone's pushing them.

7853
05:31:20,810 --> 05:31:21,850
Crack the horizon?

7854
05:31:22,910 --> 05:31:23,950

7855
05:31:24,590 --> 05:31:26,230

Careful, careful.

7864
05:31:44,370 --> 05:31:45,370
I don't think we...

7865
05:31:45,370 --> 05:31:46,070
Another team.

7866
05:31:46,350 --> 05:31:46,630
Another team.

7867
05:31:46,910 --> 05:31:47,410
Another team?

7868
05:31:47,790 --> 05:31:48,350
Okay, okay.

7871
05:31:52,810 --> 05:31:53,990
Another team, another team.

7872
05:31:54,230 --> 05:31:54,650
I don't have Q.

7873
05:31:56,290 --> 05:31:56,450
Okay.

7874
05:31:57,570 --> 05:31:58,290
I have Q.

7875
05:31:58,410 --> 05:31:58,670

Come to me, Ditto.

7879
05:32:02,170 --> 05:32:02,670
There's so much left.

7880
05:32:02,930 --> 05:32:03,330
Okay, okay.

05:32:04,430 --> 05:32:05,270
Okay, go back.

7882
05:32:05,430 --> 05:32:06,810
Go back, fall back, because there's a...

7883
05:32:07,630 --> 05:32:08,490
Okay, okay, okay.

7884
05:32:08,490 --> 05:32:08,750

7885
05:32:08,930 --> 05:32:09,090

7886
05:32:09,270 --> 05:32:09,890
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

7887
05:32:10,090 --> 05:32:13,670
We can go on the outside, I feel like.

7888
05:32:15,090 --> 05:32:16,910
Actually, Lincoln, where do we go?

7889
05:32:17,370 --> 05:32:18,430
Inside the building, inside the building.

7890
05:32:18,530 --> 05:32:18,810
Yeah, yeah.

7891
05:32:18,910 --> 05:32:19,590
Do you want to go outside?

7892
05:32:19,810 --> 05:32:20,630
I got the bag first.

7893
05:32:23,070 --> 05:32:24,230
We can stay here.

7894
05:32:25,070 --> 05:32:25,730
We can go here.

7895
05:32:26,090 --> 05:32:26,650
Stay here for now.

7896
05:32:26,710 --> 05:32:29,410
I don't want to go there because I feel like everybody
should shoot us there.

7897
05:32:29,550 --> 05:32:31,090
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

7898
05:32:33,310 --> 05:32:35,670

05:32:50,240 --> 05:32:51,120
Whoa, careful.

7903
05:32:51,960 --> 05:32:52,020
Wow.

7904
05:32:59,500 --> 05:33:00,320
I'm gonna check our back.

7905
05:33:00,340 --> 05:33:02,380
There might be someone in the tunnel.

7906
05:33:05,040 --> 05:33:06,080
I'm double checking.

7907
05:33:08,120 --> 05:33:09,080
Save, save.

7908
05:33:10,080 --> 05:33:11,360
Oh, so close.

7909
05:33:12,800 --> 05:33:12,980
Whoa!

05:33:14,140 --> 05:33:14,620
They have Kraber.

7912
05:33:16,280 --> 05:33:17,240

7913
05:33:17,760 --> 05:33:18,220
Good luck.

7914

7916
05:33:20,680 --> 05:33:20,800

Found a repeater.

05:34:15,420 --> 05:34:16,460
We could go here, too.

7934
05:34:18,640 --> 05:34:19,640

I'm trying to look right now.

7948
05:34:44,080 --> 05:34:45,880

7949
05:34:46,160 --> 05:34:47,180
Oh, here?

7950
05:34:47,780 --> 05:34:48,760
Octane over.

7951
05:34:50,680 --> 05:34:52,500
I don't have an angle.

7952
05:34:53,440 --> 05:34:54,320
Are you going there?

7953
05:34:55,400 --> 05:34:55,920
Okay.

7954
05:34:58,600 --> 05:34:59,060

05:35:03,680 --> 05:35:04,760
Alright, I'm gonna get across.

7957
05:35:04,900 --> 05:35:10,790
Oh my god, I wish I had a sniper stock.

7958
05:35:10,890 --> 05:35:13,210
Can I get...

7959
05:35:13,210 --> 05:35:14,310
One team at market.

7960
05:35:16,210 --> 05:35:18,230
So much harder with no sniper stock.

7961
05:35:19,650 --> 05:35:20,270
Can we go there?

7962
05:35:20,490 --> 05:35:21,530
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

7963
05:35:22,990 --> 05:35:24,530
I'm safe here too.

7964
05:35:25,290 --> 05:35:25,490
Okay.

7965
05:35:26,270 --> 05:35:28,390
I'll stay here for now for a cross.

7966
05:35:31,110 --> 05:35:34,370
I don't know where the other team is.

7967
05:35:38,310 --> 05:35:38,450
Okay.

7968
05:35:39,390 --> 05:35:40,410
Is that right?

7969
05:35:40,730 --> 05:35:41,410
He's not behind.

7970
05:35:42,350 --> 05:35:44,210
Oh, the high ground team.

7971
05:35:44,750 --> 05:35:45,870
I think we have to go.

7972
05:35:46,930 --> 05:35:47,410
Shit!

7973
05:35:48,490 --> 05:35:49,850
Oh my god!

7974
05:35:55,150 --> 05:35:55,710
Okay,

7975
05:36:04,250 --> 05:36:06,390
I think we should go under, right?

7976
05:36:06,870 --> 05:36:07,350
Okay.

7977
05:36:08,090 --> 05:36:08,690
Do we portal?

7978
05:36:09,570 --> 05:36:10,250
For it?

7979
05:36:10,330 --> 05:36:10,550
Maybe?

7980
05:36:11,430 --> 05:36:12,130
I don't have portal.

7981
05:36:12,710 --> 05:36:14,470
Like Uto, Uto has portal.

7982
05:36:14,710 --> 05:36:16,450
Oh, Uto, can you?

7983
05:36:16,490 --> 05:36:18,490
Can you...

7984
05:36:19,810 --> 05:36:20,930
Maybe portal under?

7985
05:36:21,430 --> 05:36:22,690
Portal under?

7986
05:36:23,850 --> 05:36:24,970
I believe in you.

7987
05:36:25,530 --> 05:36:25,790
Fuck that.

7988
05:36:25,910 --> 05:36:28,930
Whoever made that fucking...

7989
05:36:28,930 --> 05:36:29,450
Cover.

7990
05:36:29,830 --> 05:36:30,310
Let it flash.

7991
05:36:30,470 --> 05:36:31,710
We got her.

7992
05:36:35,220 --> 05:36:35,800
Is it safe?

7993
05:36:36,820 --> 05:36:37,280
Safe, safe.

7994
05:36:37,360 --> 05:36:37,940
We got the goal!

7995
05:36:38,100 --> 05:36:38,400
We got the goal!

7996
05:36:38,980 --> 05:36:39,500
Yes!

7997
05:36:43,360 --> 05:36:45,320
Careful, careful.

7998
05:36:45,640 --> 05:36:46,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

7999
05:36:47,920 --> 05:36:48,900
I'm gonna back.

8000
05:36:51,580 --> 05:36:52,060
Okay.

8001
05:36:54,140 --> 05:36:55,660
Oh, Krabber over here.

8002
05:36:56,720 --> 05:36:57,200
Yeah.

8003
05:36:59,380 --> 05:37:00,360
Safe here too.

8004
05:37:00,620 --> 05:37:01,020
Safe here.

8005
05:37:02,380 --> 05:37:02,500
Okay.

8006
05:37:03,400 --> 05:37:03,540
Yeah.

8007
05:37:03,900 --> 05:37:04,980
If we need to, we can.

8008
05:37:05,740 --> 05:37:06,220
They come here.

8009
05:37:06,300 --> 05:37:06,660
They come here.

8010
05:37:06,780 --> 05:37:07,040
Least.

8011
05:37:07,640 --> 05:37:08,660
Nice, nice, nice, nice.

8012
05:37:09,020 --> 05:37:09,660
Kill, kill, kill.

8013
05:37:14,340 --> 05:37:15,760
This is safe too.

8014
05:37:15,900 --> 05:37:16,400
Where I am?

8015
05:37:17,340 --> 05:37:17,580
Okay.

8016
05:37:21,430 --> 05:37:22,890
There's sniper stock in there?

8017
05:37:23,130 --> 05:37:23,550
Can you check?

8018
05:37:25,010 --> 05:37:27,050
Can you check if sniper stock?

8019
05:37:28,690 --> 05:37:28,970
Sniper?

8020
05:37:29,270 --> 05:37:30,310
Sniper stock.

8021
05:37:31,650 --> 05:37:32,530
I don't know.

8022
05:37:32,730 --> 05:37:32,850
Okay.

8023
05:37:33,250 --> 05:37:33,810
You check real fast?

8024
05:37:33,930 --> 05:37:34,110
Yeah, yeah.

8025
05:37:34,130 --> 05:37:34,890
I need sniper stock.

8026
05:37:35,470 --> 05:37:35,830
This.

8027
05:37:36,250 --> 05:37:37,530
Um, no, no, no, no.

8028
05:37:39,630 --> 05:37:40,590
Don't have it.

8029
05:37:42,030 --> 05:37:45,270
I think it's like a team here and then above us.

8030
05:37:45,530 --> 05:37:46,290
The Kraver team.

8031
05:37:46,610 --> 05:37:46,790
Yeah.

8032
05:37:47,170 --> 05:37:48,230

Oh, no, no.

8034
05:37:48,710 --> 05:37:49,670
We killed the Kraver team.

8035
05:37:49,950 --> 05:37:51,050
Yeah, there's no Kraver team.

8036
05:37:52,650 --> 05:37:53,170
Okay.
