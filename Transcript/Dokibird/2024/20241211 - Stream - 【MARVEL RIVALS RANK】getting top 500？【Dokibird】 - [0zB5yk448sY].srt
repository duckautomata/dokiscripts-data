And this guy has 20.2 hours by the way that one is the cutoff for top 500 might I add So thank you random guides that use and not only that this is a global This is a global leaderboard Which means it includes the around the world.

18
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:51,920
So it's not just NA they combine NA, EU Asia and like all the other regions together for this global leaderboard.

19
00:03:52,040 --> 00:04:01,280

So So like I'm really proud of myself I'm honestly like incredibly proud of myself to be able to get this close to top 500 with my incredibly fucking busy hours Just cuz like, you know, I didn't play that much too.

27
00:04:54,020 --> 00:05:04,680
I haven't even played that much I played like 6.6 hours and like being able to get this far up within like just like Two days like like, you know last night plus like the day.

28
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:21,440
I only played like maybe like I played like the two days ago I played till I got to bronze one and I stopped cuz I was like, yeah, whatever and then last night I think I got to actually there was a bronze I think it's not that silver or something and then last night I got to like plaid.

29
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:27,340
So I was like, oh, it's fine I've been doing solo duos solo duos.

30
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:36,880
I did duo with sure for yesterday like a little bit was sure for yesterday and I was like higher ranked than him and I was like laughing at him cuz he was silver and I was gold and I was like

38
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,040

39
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,040
That's it statistic.

40
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:16,820

41
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:23,720

00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,980
Can you can you tell chat?

43
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:48,520
Yes, guys, I'm a I'm a Luna snow one trick because like She she was like she's been in the game since since Alpha and because of that I already know her entire move set and then I don't fucking know I don't know how play mantis and cloak and dagger.

44
00:06:48,660 --> 00:07:18,640
I already got too far You know when you like get too far and then you're like you can't learn other characters anymore Because you know if you try to play other characters at this elo you're gonna fucking be like you might as well be dead like Just like throw So I was just like I'm just I I just like boxed myself in the corner because I kept winning as Luna snow So like I was like,

45
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:29,600
well, I kept winning as her So I might as well just keep going with what I know and obviously the more player the better I got So then I kept getting better at her and I was like, well, what do what fuck do I do now?

46
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,960
I'm into deep guys.

47
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:38,620
I can't learn a new character.

48
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:56,780
I'm into fucking deep It's too late my elos way too high to do something else so when someone else picks Luna snow I'd be like I'll be like well Actually, I don't say anything.

49
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,760
I just accept the loss like

50
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:17,660
No, I try to play I try to play like mantis and Jeff when I don't get Luna snow though, like, you know, I try to make it work So like and then when the other support swaps off Luna if we're losing I take Luna back.

51
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:18,160
I

52
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:32,240
I Just like I'm just waiting till the other support swaps off Luna and then I'll be like, all right, give me a It's time to play you want to see my win rate on mantis.

53
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:33,620
Yeah

54
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:54,360
But like yeah, we don't talk about My nine whole minutes losing on mantis We don't talk about that.

55
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,400
Yeah Yeah.

56
00:08:56,400 --> 00:09:00,340
Yeah when I play tank, it doesn't go so well on tank.

57
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:07,460
It does not go so well But hey, I'm a pretty good win rate on Punisher three out of two or two out of three.

58
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:18,520
That's pretty good That's pretty good but yeah, I've been like super addicted to marble rivals only because like You guys don't know about it for those who are new here I don't know this about me.

59
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:35,080
Um, whenever a new shiny competitive game comes out I speed run to the leaderboards and then after getting it I stop So like I might try and end top 500 marble rivals because after I get it I just don't care about it anymore because that's how it usually goes like

60
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:51,640
That's how like Yeah, cuz I've done that for splatoon I got the highest rank possible in splatoon I think I got s rank and I got and I was like, I'm done with splatoon.

61
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:53,320
I like splatoon 3, right?

62
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:54,340
Yeah, it was a splatoon.

63
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:55,740
It's splatoon 3, right?

64
00:09:55,800 --> 00:10:00,380
Yeah, so I got splatoon 3 I got the highest rank possible, which was s rank at that time.

65
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,340
There was an x-ran yet.

66
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:15,240
There was no x-rank yet I got to s and I stopped playing splatoon after that because I got it I was like I'm done and then same with overwatch 2 I got to Grat like I got to top 200 in overwatch 2 and now I was done.

67
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,180
I was like, I'm done

68
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:23,620
I was just like Fine, it's fine.

69
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:47,460
I got what I wanted and I don't play as much I do sometimes relapse into it, but like Never to the full point never to like we're like back to like, you know I don't I relapse into it, but I don't grind as if I'll die if I don't get the elo I wanted Right now I'm like that with my rivals at the moment right now I'm just like I have to get this I have to get top 500.

70
00:10:47,700 --> 00:11:10,780
I have to it's the newest fun game it's so like it boosts my own ego and like um You know It's I won't boost my own ego and stuff to make myself feel better about myself because I'm like, oh my god Doki You're not as washed as you think you are Oh My god,

71
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:17,820
you know what they all say they always like Doki you're so washed But I'm like, but I still made it a top.

72
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:18,240
Okay.

73
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:27,220
I haven't yet haven't yet I don't want jinx myself, but like I'm so close to top 500 on the newest game that came out

74
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:37,720
So like so like if I get it then I can be then I can brag about it Then I can be like egotistical about it.

75
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:56,240
So like I don't know if it's actually good to enable me like this I Don't know if it's good to enable me to be top 500 because you know My ego is gonna go even higher after that like, you know, it's not my you know, my I'm not gonna be humble at all

82
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:41,240
Ah I'm so like nervous though, cuz like I tried I try so hard when it comes to like When I play off stream, I actually work try so hard off stream.

194
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,740
Why is it 140?

195
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,080
I was playing too- is it cuz I'm streaming?

196
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:45,600
No, when I was streaming it was 200.

197
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:48,660
I remember Why is it 140?

198
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:53,120
I was playing like 200 frames off stream.

199
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:58,000
It was really weird Maybe I set to low?

200
00:24:58,900 --> 00:24:59,460
Maybe?

201
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:03,920
I didn't cap it Hmm, maybe I put low.

202
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:06,080
Maybe I should put low then.

203
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,640
I don't want to play in low.

204
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:10,420
Yeah All right, guys.

205
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:10,900
I'm sorry.

206
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:16,040
Looks like shit I'm sorry, everybody.

207
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:19,540
It's all about the optimization

208
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:32,280
Okay, maybe I'll turn off low qual- maybe I'll turn off the lights Okay, no, it's still at hundred and fifth guys.

209
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:41,740
I'm sorry guys I'm sorry when- if you watch pro- if you watch good players, they're also all their settings are on low I'm sorry, everybody.

210
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:50,760
It's all about the frame optimization We have to It's the risk we gotta take.

211
00:25:50,840 --> 00:26:01,340
It's the sacrifices we make for top 500 I'm sorry if it looks uglier now All right.

212
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:03,640
I need the frames!

213
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:04,460
I need it!

214
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:08,160
Okay, here we go All right, I did lose a game.

215
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:08,920
One game.

216
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:16,240
You might tell- you can see that I got minus 12 because I lost a game and then I stopped because I was like, I'll play tomorrow I'd get back to work.

217
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,540
I'll play tomorrow.

218
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:29,380
I got plat and I was like, I can do this and then I was like, I lost and I was like, yep That's a- that's for future Doki to do.

219
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:32,100
I'm nervous.

220
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:43,700
I'm so nervous now Cuz like I like, you know playing on rank- playing rank off stream is so different versus playing Okay, well, oh, thank you.

221
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:45,240
Thank you.

222
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:45,740
Okay

223
00:26:54,580 --> 00:27:02,320
It's okay see they see that and they're like, oh she must be a Luna snow one trick and I'm like damn right I am I got to this elo

224
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:09,900
I got to this elo play Luna snow, please.

225
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:12,400
I'm scared of playing other characters now

226
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:17,400
I'm a problem.

227
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,720
I'm the problem.

228
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:21,760
They told you about the one tricks they warned you about

229
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:32,040
All right, I'm the one tricks they warn you It's not that different not gonna lie.

230
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:39,100
It feels more- I feel like low Low graphics makes the game- makes the models look more comic book-y.

231
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:40,040
I don't know.

232
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:40,580
What do you think?

233
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:50,320
It actually makes it like models look like like the colors look more like a comic book colors Okay All right.

234
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,440
I'm ready to focus up.

235
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:51,800
Okay.

236
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,960
All right guys, I might be like super focused.

237
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:57,820
I might not talk too much Yeah, it still looks pretty decent

238
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:14,260
Try not to move- because like the best thing about Luna is that you can heal from afar, which is nice

239
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:18,480
I'm just hoping.

240
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:20,100
Okay.

241
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:22,780

That's why I have it on Hela.

245
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:30,040
I see her as a carry.

246
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:34,880
If you insta-pick Hela I assume you can carry like honestly

247
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:42,000
Hela is usually like the carry potent- carry DPS.

248
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:43,360
Oh my god.

249
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:43,940

Not Hawkeye.

258
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:10,880
Hawkeye's scary.

259
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:11,740
He can one-shot.

260
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:16,260
So I need to play corners I'm playing corners right now

261

00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,220
That's not fair!

312
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:58,800
I almost killed him too!

313
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:01,540
I had no more cooldowns!

314
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:04,900
Okay I'll give it to Hella.

315
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:06,560
I think Hella's been- yeah.

316
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,460
No, actually Namor's been carrying.

317
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:11,480
I'll give it to Namor I usually put it on the carry.

318
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:20,000
If we don't have two tanks, I put it on whoever is the DPS carry and that flanks a lot Cuz you know, they deserve it.

319
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:23,300
Come on!

320
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,640
I just gassed you up, bro!

321
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:30,160
I literally just gassed you up!

322
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,620
How could you die like that?

323
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:39,220
Oh my god, okay.

324
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:40,080
I'm just sick.

325
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:46,500
Okay To heal myself by healing him.

326
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:51,540
I usually use my shiv when I'm low or like as like, uh, what's it called?

327
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:56,660
Or like if I have to use it to defend myself

328
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:02,480
Oh, I didn't hit that?

329
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:08,260
Okay, that's fine That's okay NAMOR!

330
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:08,820
STOP!

331
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:18,960
Okay All right He's also- they also ulted too, so I countered support ulted That's okay, I got you.

332
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,900
I got you, Magneto.

333
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,560
Oh my god, just use everything, I guess.

334
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:28,860
I guess just use everything in your inventory.

335
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:30,220
That's fine.

336
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:41,780
That's all that was- we gotta regroup I- I gotta regroup now Bro, they used like literally everything for that.

337
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:43,620
Oh no, we have two minutes left.

338
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:47,000
Okay, I'll give you- get over here Get over here.

339
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:48,640
I'm gonna give you the- I'm gonna give you the Zen orb.

340
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:49,400
Get over here.

341
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:52,180
Yeah, I got you You're fine.

342
00:33:52,700 --> 00:34:03,780
You're so healthy I need to watch like pro Luna Snow players and see like what- how to actually- like everything I learned from Luna Snow It's just me learning it myself.

343
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:18,120
So like I- I don't actually know how to play her that optimally So like I won't watch like an actual Pro player and see how- oh my god, I felt like that- I thought I was like the enemy in the morning thing.

344
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:26,060
I don't know why Yeah, there's like, you know, there's like Diamond plus Luna Snow players.

345
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:51,860
Like I basically self-taught myself Luna Snow all the way from Since alpha so like I don't know how to actually play her optimally Like in overwatch I would just watch like players who are obviously better than me and like how they How they learn like how they play their support players.

346
00:34:51,940 --> 00:35:08,700
How they play their support characters So like I don't know what I'm doing is actually like how you're supposed to play her So, so I want to learn from other like Luna players to figure out how like to like play her like the most optimal

347
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:26,240
All right How the Knights think of the magenta soup, but they get the time to face the consequences of gambling to beat Majora's Mask I'll give you 500, I can't wait to see the content.

348
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:28,400
Thank you for the magenta soup, but thank you.

349
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:29,040
Thank you.

350
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:35,740
Oh, yeah But like, okay, but what if I get top 500 Marvel rivals, it's basically the same thing

351
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:56,860
I was gonna play Majora's, I want to play Majora's Mask anyway, but like I'll still play Majora's Mask But like, it's the same thing if you think about it It's sort of the same thing You know Yeah

352
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:11,080
I'm trying to think of like, okay, I'm gonna heal the Namor because I feel like the Namor Greaves so- like not greaves, but like he takes- look at that.

353
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:33,820
He already took so much damage The Namor is taking so much damage Okay Let me see if I can get random ice Sometimes I throw the ice just to- if I know they're not pushing it, I throw the ice randomly Oh My god, they're so close.

354
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:35,400
They're scaring me right now.

355
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:39,760
Oh my god, they're actually scaring me.

356
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:42,480
I need to use this to fast heal this.

357
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,420
Oh my god, please!

358
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:48,420
Oh, you're scaring me!

359
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:52,680
Not has to be Majora's Mask!

360
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:54,760
Lurkrosis, they give the Akasupa!

361
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:55,880
Thank you, thank you!

362
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:58,000
Yeah, this is what happens.

363
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:02,360
Like that's why I try to throw random ice out Just to see if I can get the random ice out.

364
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:09,120
Oh, it is getting a little scary now Okay

365
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:27,160
I think like I should try and aim my ice like not randomly if they're like trying to push This is like my weakest point because I'm like, oh they're not fighting it so I can technically fucking throw it randomly if I want to

366
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:32,260
This is...

367
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:36,520
Okay Alright, that's fine.

368
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:37,060
I have ult.

369
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:38,660
No!

370
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:44,800
I might have to... I'm gonna use ult.

371
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:46,580
It's fine.

372
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:47,400
They counter ulted.

373
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:50,560
So like it's a good trait because like they counter ult it too.

374
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:52,320
So like that's...

375
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:54,280
Oh god, why are you over there?!

376
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:58,320
That's fine, they used like 200 fucking thousand ults.

377
00:37:58,460 --> 00:37:58,920
That's fine.

378
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:00,640
Like I'm okay with that.

379
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:02,880
Like I'm gonna die anyway!

380
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:08,520
Oh my god,

381
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,180
okay, that's fine.

382
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:20,340
We were gonna... there was... we were not gonna be alive for that unless like we lost your tank.

383
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,140
Wait, what the fuck?

384
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:23,920
Guys, there's a fucking Magneto!

385
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:26,220

388
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:35,660

389
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:35,940
Okay.

390
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:39,140

391
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:40,980
What the fuck?!

392
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:41,760
What?!

393
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:42,200
I...

394
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:45,200
Okay, I stole... I killed two by myself.

395
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:45,980
That's fine.

396
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:48,180
That's fine.

397
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,520
Alright, that's fine.

398
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,260
I got the two myself.

399
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,560
He just stood there.

400
00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:01,740
Oh my god, what the fuck was he doing there?

401
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:06,160
I found out that this is like activated by... I'm fucked.

402
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:07,760
Oh my god, please.

403
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,020
Oh please!

404
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:11,800
I didn't realize there was...

405
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:14,120
They pushed up that much?!

406
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:15,540
Holy fuck!

407
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:20,140
Okay, I walked over and I was like, Oh no, I went the wrong way.

408
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:24,260
I didn't know I went the wrong way!

409
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,420
Guys, I didn't know!

410
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:33,260
If I knew, I wouldn't be there!

411
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:36,480
Is it really throwing if I didn't know?

412
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,360
If I was ignorant?

413
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:41,000
Oh my god, maybe it is.

414
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:41,640
Nevermind.

415
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:43,700
Okay, I can heal myself in this.

416
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:46,840
Oh god.

417
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:48,380

419
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:50,760
Guys, get the point!

420
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:55,620

Oh no.

423
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:02,240
Oh no, this might be over.

424
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:04,520
We're getting hard snowballed right now.

425
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:06,300
Like, we're doing what they did to us.

426
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,840
Oh my god, fuck.

427
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:12,580
We're getting super hard snowballed.

428
00:40:17,270 --> 00:40:18,590
Oh no, oh no.

429
00:40:19,510 --> 00:40:20,650
Oh, thank you.

430
00:40:21,350 --> 00:40:21,890
Thank you.

431
00:40:22,830 --> 00:40:23,910
I'm okay, I'm okay.

432
00:40:24,690 --> 00:40:25,510
We're okay.

433
00:40:29,050 --> 00:40:30,470
I'm getting hard.

434
00:40:30,610 --> 00:40:31,630
Oh my god, guys.

435
00:40:32,410 --> 00:40:32,930
Please.

436
00:40:34,290 --> 00:40:36,730
You guys gotta play together, guys.

437
00:40:38,010 --> 00:40:38,530
Nice.

438
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:41,230
Please.

439
00:40:41,610 --> 00:40:42,570
Push up, please!

440
00:40:43,630 --> 00:40:44,810
You guys gotta push up!

441
00:40:44,830 --> 00:40:47,190
We can't give them so much free space!

442
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:54,960
I'm healing as much as I can.

443
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:56,120
Alright, no more.

444
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:56,800
Okay, who's carrying?

445
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:58,560
Okay, Punisher's carrying.

446
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,520
You don't deserve this anymore.

447
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:03,920
Wait, no, Nomura's actually carrying.

448
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:04,560
Nevermind.

449
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,400
JK, Nomura, I wasn't reading the names properly.

450
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:09,320
You deserve it.

451
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:11,460
Don't worry, Nomura, I got you.

452
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:13,800
Oh no.

453
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:15,580
Oh my god.

454
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:19,520
I am ready to put on a show.

455
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:23,640
I am so ready to put on a show, guys.

456
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:25,640
Guys, please.

457
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:27,900
Oh, please.

458
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:30,520
I am so ready to put on a show.

459
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:33,540
I think I am.

460
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:34,500
There we go.

461
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:35,720
I'm so ready.

462
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:42,000
I'm so ready to put on that show.

463
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,680
Okay, the Nomura's still alive.

464
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:46,180
Oh, this is bad.

465
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:47,780
They're so pushed up.

466
00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:50,840
The thing is, we didn't freaking stand on the payload.

467
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:57,840
Yeah, the Psylocke ulted when I still had my ult, so that was really dumb of them.

468
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:00,420
Jesus Christ.

469
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:00,840
Stop.

470
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:03,420
Stop feeding.

471
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:04,240
Stop.

472
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:07,040
Stop.

473
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:11,260
The fuck are you- Stop.

474
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:13,420
Okay.

475
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:18,880
Please.

476
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:20,240
Please!

477
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:22,900
Why are you guys feeding?!

478
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:28,300
Guys, I need you guys to push up!

479
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:33,220
Oh, no.

480
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:35,580
He's one.

481
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:35,960
He's one.

482
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:36,720
Nice.

483
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:40,660
Oh, he's so low, too.

484
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:42,740
Oh, they're all so low.

485
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:46,680
It's fine.

486
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:51,880
We need heals.

487
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:52,340
Okay.

488
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:53,960
Alright, we're fine.

489
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:56,280
We're not so fine.

490
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:58,520
I don't feel so good, but we're fine, guys.

491
00:42:58,820 --> 00:42:59,820
I almost had my ult.

492
00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:04,320
Oh, guys.

493
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:05,620
You guys are pushed so high.

494
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:06,480
So ahead.

495
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:09,040
Guys, you're scaring me.

496
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:11,340
You're scaring me when you're up there.

497
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:13,700
Please.

498
00:43:14,140 --> 00:43:16,020
You're scaring me so much.

499
00:43:18,020 --> 00:43:21,180
I need to, like, pre-heal them.

500
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:26,100
Okay.

501
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:29,180
I have ult for last fight.

502
00:43:33,810 --> 00:43:34,850
I have ult for last fight.

503
00:43:38,430 --> 00:43:39,270
There we go.

504
00:43:42,230 --> 00:43:45,070
We're standing my fucking- Standing this!

505
00:43:45,470 --> 00:43:46,690
Standing this!

506
00:43:47,090 --> 00:43:50,470
You'll live for so long if you just stand in this!

507
00:43:50,510 --> 00:43:51,330
Oh, my god!

508
00:43:55,210 --> 00:43:55,810
Oh, my god!

509
00:44:02,210 --> 00:44:02,590
Please!

510
00:44:04,010 --> 00:44:04,610
Please!

511
00:44:04,890 --> 00:44:05,990
I have to do a stun!

512
00:44:09,620 --> 00:44:10,680
Oh, they got off!

513
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:11,640
They got off!

514
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:12,560
They did it!

515
00:44:12,620 --> 00:44:13,480
They got off!

516
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:15,560
Oh, my god!

517
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:19,060
Oh, my god!

518
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:19,840
We did it!

519
00:44:20,140 --> 00:44:21,340
We did it!

520
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:23,640
Yes!

521
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:24,140
Yes!

522
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:25,600
They C9'd!

523
00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:27,640
They C9'd!

524
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:29,700
Oh, my god, bro!

525
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:31,220
Okay, she got 35.

526
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:34,780
Jesus Christ, how much was their- Their team was feeding.

527
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:38,560
Holy shit, their team was feeding fucking hard.

528
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:40,480
Oh, my god, 35.

529
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:43,240
My 28k heals were insane.

530
00:44:43,460 --> 00:44:45,460
Oh, to be fair, I was DPSing more than her, though.

531
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:48,000
I was DPSing more than her.

532
00:44:49,940 --> 00:44:50,420
There.

533
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:52,640
The enemy, um...

534
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:54,420
The enemy, uh...

535
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:57,140
Luna had 35k heals.

536
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:58,040
And I'm like, how?

537
00:44:58,440 --> 00:44:59,600
How the fuck?

538
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:00,800
Alright.

539
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:02,300
Okay, we won.

540
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:03,060
Oh, thank god.

541
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:04,460
We won the first game, guys.

542
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,300
That seems so sick.

543
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:08,600
It is.

544
00:45:10,780 --> 00:45:13,000
That's why I'm, like, trying to lock in.

545
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:18,860
These games are incredibly stressful, so I'm trying my best to fucking lock it in.

546
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:22,760
They're so stressful.

547
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:24,860
Alright.

548
00:45:25,580 --> 00:45:25,960
Yeah!

549
00:45:26,180 --> 00:45:27,520
That's right, fuck you, Margo!

550
00:45:30,220 --> 00:45:31,340
Fuck you!

551
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:32,920
That's right.

552
00:45:33,220 --> 00:45:33,780
No!

553
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:35,200
Oh, my god.

554
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:36,560
Oh, my god.

555
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:38,320
Okay, we'll do Jeff.

556
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:41,460
Cause I feel like if I play...

557
00:45:41,460 --> 00:45:44,140
If I play, um...

558
00:45:44,140 --> 00:45:46,180
I can't, I'm weak.

559
00:45:46,580 --> 00:45:48,080
I'm so weak.

560
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:52,120
Oh, my god.

561
00:45:52,260 --> 00:45:52,880
It's okay.

562
00:45:53,140 --> 00:45:54,260
If we lose, it's her fault.

563
00:45:54,380 --> 00:45:55,100
Not my fault.

564
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:57,600
It's her fault if we lose.

565
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:00,080
Cause she wouldn't let me play my one trick.

566
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:02,060
Alright.

567
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:05,500
Alright, I'm Jeff now.

568
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:07,080
My name's Jeff.

569
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:08,740
I know I should do...

570
00:46:08,740 --> 00:46:12,740
I feel more confident on Jeff than I do...

571
00:46:13,420 --> 00:46:19,760
I feel much more confident on Jeff than I do on Cloak and Dagger and Mantis.

572
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:23,660
Cause I know Mantis is like super strong but I'm not good enough.

573
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:25,900
I get too overwhelmed on Mantis.

574
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,800
But Jeff is like a lot intuitive.

575
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:36,320
Okay, what's the comp?

576
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:37,400
Okay, we have one tank.

577
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:38,560
Alright.

578
00:46:38,740 --> 00:46:39,780
Oh, my god.

579
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:40,280
Already.

580
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:41,560
Okay.

581
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:43,220
Reloading my food.

582
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:44,660
This map again?

583
00:46:44,820 --> 00:46:45,880
I have to play it again?

584
00:46:46,180 --> 00:46:46,600
Okay.

585
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:46,760
Okay.

586
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:48,200
This is dumb.

587
00:46:48,380 --> 00:46:49,160
I have to play again.

588
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:50,820
Alright.

589
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:54,560
I'm sad I have to play this map again.

590
00:46:57,180 --> 00:46:59,080
Bro, I wanted a new map!

591
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:03,140
Oh, no.

592
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:04,660
There you go.

593
00:47:05,820 --> 00:47:06,200
Okay.

594
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:08,560
Please.

595
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:10,340
I can't reload my mouth forever.

596
00:47:10,340 --> 00:47:11,540
Hahaha.

597
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:16,600
I'm just gonna use this and take it myself.

598
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:20,440
Guys, I can't reload my mouth forever, guys!

599
00:47:24,850 --> 00:47:26,110
Jesus Christ.

600
00:47:26,270 --> 00:47:26,510
Okay.

601
00:47:27,770 --> 00:47:29,070
I need to get my own bubble.

602
00:47:32,610 --> 00:47:33,310
Jesus.

603
00:47:33,710 --> 00:47:34,210
Guys!

604
00:47:36,850 --> 00:47:38,050
Do something!

605
00:47:39,330 --> 00:47:40,770
I'm reloading my mouth!

606
00:47:42,670 --> 00:47:43,830
Jesus Christ.

607
00:47:44,190 --> 00:47:45,050
Okay.

608
00:47:45,330 --> 00:47:45,870
Nice.

609
00:47:46,170 --> 00:47:47,230
I'm going in.

610
00:47:49,250 --> 00:47:50,490
Oh, they're scared.

611
00:47:50,610 --> 00:47:51,310
They're so scared.

612
00:47:52,110 --> 00:47:52,650
Hahaha!

613
00:48:00,310 --> 00:48:02,150
I got their support, too.

614
00:48:05,270 --> 00:48:07,150
There we go.

615
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:20,840
Easy.

616
00:48:22,340 --> 00:48:24,500
You better be scared.

617
00:48:25,940 --> 00:48:27,440
That was a good ult from me, too.

618
00:48:28,220 --> 00:48:29,820
That was a really good ult from me.

619
00:48:33,750 --> 00:48:40,270
I try not to put too many bubbles because they're very good for, like, like, for backup.

620
00:48:43,150 --> 00:48:44,910
I'm surprised the Luna died!

621
00:48:45,050 --> 00:48:47,090
I was not expecting the Luna to be dead.

622
00:48:47,730 --> 00:48:52,770
Because they're good burst healing, so I'm trying not to use too much of my...

623
00:48:53,250 --> 00:48:56,250
to use my bubble as, like, to put out my bubble.

624
00:48:58,510 --> 00:48:59,110
It's fine.

625
00:48:59,190 --> 00:48:59,810
You guys are fine.

626
00:49:00,250 --> 00:49:00,870
Reloading mouth!

627
00:49:03,750 --> 00:49:04,510
Oh, okay.

628
00:49:04,550 --> 00:49:05,270
I'm fucking leaving.

629
00:49:05,410 --> 00:49:05,730
Goodbye.

630
00:49:08,510 --> 00:49:09,970
Especially if I have to reload.

631
00:49:13,310 --> 00:49:13,750
There we go.

632
00:49:14,710 --> 00:49:15,690
Oh my god, please!

633
00:49:15,810 --> 00:49:17,790
I can't reload my mouth too much!

634
00:49:21,050 --> 00:49:23,050
Like, I put backup here, but...

635
00:49:23,050 --> 00:49:23,490
Oh no!

636
00:49:24,270 --> 00:49:25,710
My backup was right there!

637
00:49:26,050 --> 00:49:27,090
This is a hate crime!

638
00:49:30,370 --> 00:49:31,630
Against sharks!

639
00:49:32,130 --> 00:49:33,870
I fucking hate sharks!

640
00:49:36,910 --> 00:49:38,430
Okay, I'm coming back.

641
00:49:39,470 --> 00:49:40,010
But, um...

642
00:49:40,010 --> 00:49:40,530
Yes!

643
00:49:40,710 --> 00:49:41,630
Against sharks!

644
00:49:42,410 --> 00:49:44,190
It's like Jaws all over again!

645
00:49:47,570 --> 00:49:48,670
It's like...

646
00:49:48,670 --> 00:49:49,550
It's like Jaws!

647
00:49:49,550 --> 00:49:49,790
Yes!

648
00:49:51,810 --> 00:49:53,570
Sharks are not bad people!

649
00:49:54,090 --> 00:49:56,950
They're not people either, but they're not actually that bad!

650
00:50:02,050 --> 00:50:02,530
Okay.

651
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:06,600
Okay.

652
00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:10,060
Oh, nice.

653
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:12,220
Okay, I might be able to...

654
00:50:12,220 --> 00:50:14,280
If they push, I'm gonna ult them off the point.

655
00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:17,000
I think that's, like, the plan.

656
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:20,700
Are they push up?

657
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:22,420
There's no way.

658
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:23,440
Are they actually gonna push up?

659
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:25,160
Are they gonna give it to us?

660
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:25,720
Yes!

661
00:50:26,420 --> 00:50:27,300
We got it for free!

662
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:28,240
I'm not gonna ult then.

663
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:29,880
We got it for free too.

664
00:50:31,340 --> 00:50:31,740
Alright.

665
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:34,860
It's good.

666
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:37,520
Oh shit, I didn't see you!

667
00:50:37,580 --> 00:50:37,760
Sorry!

668
00:50:41,260 --> 00:50:42,140
He's so low!

669
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:43,640
Get him!

670
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:44,300
Get him!

671
00:50:44,300 --> 00:50:45,120
Come on!

672
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:46,280
Don't be a pussy!

673
00:50:48,260 --> 00:50:51,800
Don't be a- Sorry, I should've healed you.

674
00:50:53,580 --> 00:50:54,500
Sorry, bro.

675
00:50:55,460 --> 00:50:56,920
I should've healed you.

676
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:00,340
Okay, I can ult this whenever.

677
00:51:01,220 --> 00:51:02,600
Let's see, I'll do it here.

678
00:51:07,820 --> 00:51:08,880
Wait, what?

679
00:51:09,140 --> 00:51:10,080
Oh, I did get him.

680
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:11,960
Woah, woah, woah.

681
00:51:12,060 --> 00:51:12,480
No!

682
00:51:12,820 --> 00:51:13,140
No!

683
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:14,560
I got too cocky!

684
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:17,360
I thought I got more!

685
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:19,720
Oh my god.

686
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:21,380
I got way too cocky.

687
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:24,220
Bro, I saved them!

688
00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:26,040
I might go...

689
00:51:27,100 --> 00:51:27,660
Warlock...

690
00:51:27,660 --> 00:51:29,020
Atom for the res.

691
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:32,740
I don't think- I don't think shark is good this area.

692
00:51:32,980 --> 00:51:33,600
I'm gonna go- yeah.

693
00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:35,220
I'm gonna swap healer.

694
00:51:35,220 --> 00:51:36,320
Okay.

695
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:41,020
I think warlock is better at this point.

696
00:51:41,580 --> 00:51:43,220
Just for the...

697
00:51:49,230 --> 00:51:49,850
Okay.

698
00:51:52,270 --> 00:51:57,650
I think it's better only because the res is really good.

699
00:52:00,730 --> 00:52:01,790
Okay, nice.

700
00:52:05,940 --> 00:52:06,400
Come on.

701
00:52:08,660 --> 00:52:09,120
No!

702
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:10,280
No, not me!

703
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:11,540
I'm the closest too!

704
00:52:13,620 --> 00:52:15,100
Oh my god, thank god!

705
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:17,440
I was like, no, not me!

706
00:52:17,620 --> 00:52:19,080
I'm so close to everybody!

707
00:52:20,020 --> 00:52:21,640
No, I'm sleeping too!

708
00:52:22,060 --> 00:52:23,120
Why me?!

709
00:52:24,580 --> 00:52:27,120
Why is it always me?!

710
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:32,820
Why?!

711
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:38,220
Is it always me?!

712
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:43,960
Oh my god, I'm sorry.

713
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:45,780
I'm sorry.

714
00:52:46,260 --> 00:52:47,640
I'm sorry, bro.

715
00:52:48,940 --> 00:52:50,580
I'll respawn right here.

716
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:57,160
Okay, I'm gonna friendship bracelet in 7 seconds.

717
00:52:57,620 --> 00:52:58,380
Don't worry.

718
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:01,420
Friendship bracelet- Oh my god, don't worry.

719
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:02,600
Friendship bracelet in...

720
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:04,060
There we go.

721
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:04,920
Friendship!

722
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:09,260
Oh!

723
00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:11,300
There we go!

724
00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:14,340
Oh, please live!

725
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:17,200
Please, I'm clicking as much as I can!

726
00:53:18,940 --> 00:53:20,140
Maybe I should play Jeff.

727
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:22,140
These guys are not doing well.

728
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:25,400
I might play- I think I'm gonna go back.

729
00:53:25,620 --> 00:53:26,680
Oh my god, do I have to learn?

730
00:53:27,180 --> 00:53:27,740
Do I learn?

731
00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:32,620
Do I learn him right now?

732
00:53:32,740 --> 00:53:33,820
Learn Mantis right now?

733
00:53:33,820 --> 00:53:39,900
Like- Guys, I think I might have to learn Mantis.

734
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:41,420
Like, right here.

735
00:53:45,540 --> 00:53:46,260
There we go.

736
00:53:47,540 --> 00:53:48,360
Okay, nice.

737
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:50,020
We have respawned, so we'll be fine.

738
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:54,180
We literally have respawned, so we'll be fine.

739
00:53:56,860 --> 00:53:59,920
I'm not too worried because we have respawned.

740
00:54:00,940 --> 00:54:02,500
Okay, we don't have to respawn anymore.

741
00:54:06,700 --> 00:54:08,100
Oh my god!

742
00:54:08,300 --> 00:54:08,680
Please!

743
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:14,780
Okay, I'm going back.

744
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:16,180
I'm gonna learn Mantis then.

745
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:20,920
Learn and adapt, overcome!

746
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:25,000
Alright, it's time.

747
00:54:26,980 --> 00:54:28,180
Oh my god, it's time.

748
00:54:28,900 --> 00:54:33,960
There's so many- the reason why I don't like Mantis is like, there's so much.

749
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:39,140
There's so much, we got locked in!

750
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:42,780
Learning on the run!

751
00:54:43,220 --> 00:54:44,840
I'm gonna adapt to it!

752
00:54:46,380 --> 00:54:47,940
I have to adapt!

753
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:55,860
I just didn't think Jeff was the pick for the last point.

754
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:59,340
Jeff was not the pick for the last point.

755
00:54:59,340 --> 00:55:01,500
It was just way too...

756
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:05,160
There was like nothing I could do, as Jeff.

757
00:55:05,660 --> 00:55:10,420
I felt like, like no matter how much I was healing them, there was just nothing was getting done.

758
00:55:15,060 --> 00:55:16,120
Only have one tank?

759
00:55:16,220 --> 00:55:17,600
No one likes playing tank.

760
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:19,380
It's just...

761
00:55:19,380 --> 00:55:19,900
life.

762
00:55:20,140 --> 00:55:22,940
No one plays tank in this game.

763
00:55:26,080 --> 00:55:27,160
Play Cloak and Dagger?

764
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:27,900
Cloak and Dagger?

765
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:30,420
I'm so confused when I play Cloak and Dagger.

766
00:55:30,740 --> 00:55:35,180
I think like if I'm gonna... Cloak and Dagger makes me even more confused.

767
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:40,460
I play tank.

768
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:42,960
You're like literally the 1% in this game.

769
00:55:46,810 --> 00:55:48,010
Have you tried Loki yet?

770
00:55:48,030 --> 00:55:50,090
I don't like Loki in...

771
00:55:50,850 --> 00:55:51,930
the current meta.

772
00:55:53,970 --> 00:55:55,770
I think they just have better DPS than us.

773
00:55:55,930 --> 00:55:56,890
I'm gonna avoid Margo.

774
00:55:58,070 --> 00:55:59,970
Because like, I'm avoiding every support.

775
00:56:00,330 --> 00:56:04,030
Like, I can't play with another Luna Snow one trick.

776
00:56:04,130 --> 00:56:05,310
I'm avoiding Margo.

777
00:56:07,030 --> 00:56:08,590
I have to.

778
00:56:18,180 --> 00:56:19,340
I'm gonna Inspire.

779
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:21,940
What's going on?

780
00:56:22,060 --> 00:56:22,340
Oh.

781
00:56:23,100 --> 00:56:24,640
Oh, that's what's going on.

782
00:56:30,350 --> 00:56:31,550
Oh my god.

783
00:56:37,510 --> 00:56:37,890
Okay.

784
00:56:39,030 --> 00:56:40,430
Jesus Christ.

785
00:56:42,690 --> 00:56:43,490
What do you mean?

786
00:56:43,610 --> 00:56:44,190
I'm healing.

787
00:56:45,870 --> 00:56:47,070
What do you mean?

788
00:56:47,150 --> 00:56:48,850
I literally clicked on him.

789
00:56:50,230 --> 00:56:51,130
Oh my god.

790
00:56:53,790 --> 00:56:55,890
I'm literally... That's all I'm doing.

791
00:56:56,130 --> 00:56:57,970
I'm clicking so much.

792
00:56:58,830 --> 00:57:00,230
Oh my god.

793
00:57:03,140 --> 00:57:04,560
I don't even have heals left.

794
00:57:06,340 --> 00:57:07,980
That's how much I heal.

795
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:13,980
Inspire too.

796
00:57:14,140 --> 00:57:14,800
Do something.

797
00:57:15,820 --> 00:57:17,080
Oh my god.

798
00:57:17,140 --> 00:57:19,020
Like, I don't know what you wanted to do.

799
00:57:19,100 --> 00:57:21,140
You fucking went in there by yourself.

800
00:57:21,460 --> 00:57:22,820
You're fucking crazy.

801
00:57:27,560 --> 00:57:30,080
All I do is right click.

802
00:57:30,220 --> 00:57:31,660
What do you want me to do?

803
00:57:32,180 --> 00:57:33,620
I'm literally acing.

804
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,480
Because I've been right clicking so hard.

805
00:57:38,260 --> 00:57:42,420
I'm literally the ace right now because all I do is right click.

806
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:45,860
I'm just gonna wait.

807
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:50,080
Not even our fucking Luna Snow.

808
00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:00,220
Shut the fuck it up.

809
00:58:04,310 --> 00:58:05,570
Oh my god.

810
00:58:05,850 --> 00:58:06,810
Oh fucking hell.

811
00:58:08,310 --> 00:58:09,310
Oh my god.

812
00:58:09,370 --> 00:58:09,790
No!

813
00:58:11,530 --> 00:58:12,210
Sleep!

814
00:58:17,780 --> 00:58:19,220
Oh my god.

815
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:20,540
Okay, I'm not ace anymore.

816
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:24,240
Yeah, I need to get headshots.

817
00:58:24,680 --> 00:58:28,720
That's why I'm scared of playing Mantis because I'm not that good at her.

818
00:58:30,220 --> 00:58:31,180
I need to get better.

819
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:32,580
Oh my god.

820
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:33,760
No!

821
00:58:35,700 --> 00:58:36,720
I'm sorry!

822
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:37,940
You're taking so much damage!

823
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:39,560
I'm so sorry!

824
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:43,560
What do you mean?!

825
00:58:48,450 --> 00:58:49,210
I'm 18!

826
00:58:50,210 --> 00:58:53,750
Oh my

827
00:58:57,420 --> 00:58:57,980
god.

828
00:58:58,520 --> 00:59:02,220
Alright, I'm gonna avoid Margo.

829
00:59:03,020 --> 00:59:04,640
Because she's a one trick too.

830
00:59:07,820 --> 00:59:14,210
More healing than like their support!

831
00:59:14,790 --> 00:59:16,810
What do you mean?!

832
00:59:16,810 --> 00:59:19,370
We have more healing than their support!

833
00:59:23,890 --> 00:59:25,190
I'm almost dead!

834
00:59:25,510 --> 00:59:26,710
Okay, I'm gonna avoid you.

835
00:59:27,370 --> 00:59:29,430
Thank god there's an avoid.

836
00:59:29,570 --> 00:59:30,310
I can't.

837
00:59:32,090 --> 00:59:34,790
There can only be one Luna Snow one trick.

838
00:59:37,230 --> 00:59:39,010
He's bottom frag.

839
00:59:39,110 --> 00:59:40,230
Yeah, he is.

840
00:59:40,390 --> 00:59:41,650
Why are you flaming?

841
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:51,040
Yeah.

842
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:53,900
What do you mean?!

843
00:59:54,840 --> 00:59:57,260
If anything, our tank struggled the most.

844
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:01,240
He got out tanked 100%.

845
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:02,540
Who was it?

846
01:00:02,780 --> 01:00:04,620
The voice chat is broken as well.

847
01:00:07,960 --> 01:00:10,040
I don't even know who was the one that flamed.

848
01:00:11,320 --> 01:00:12,660
The voice chat is broken.

849
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:17,180
I am Groot.

850
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:20,160
Was it Punisher?

851
01:00:21,480 --> 01:00:23,400
Bro, I think it's also because...

852
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:24,040
Alright.

853
01:00:24,680 --> 01:00:25,160
Yay!

854
01:00:26,500 --> 01:00:28,420
Guys, I know I should learn another hero.

855
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:29,400
I know.

856
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:32,740
I'm in too deep, guys.

857
01:00:34,120 --> 01:00:38,040
When I hit the leaderboards, I'll learn a different healer.

858
01:00:38,140 --> 01:00:39,300
I'm in too deep.

859
01:00:39,700 --> 01:00:44,860
I'll play quick play and learn something new.

860
01:00:47,780 --> 01:00:49,020
It's too late.

861
01:00:49,620 --> 01:00:51,300
We're already too high.

862
01:00:53,960 --> 01:00:55,380
This is plat 3.

863
01:00:55,900 --> 01:00:57,440
It's plat 3 at the moment.

864
01:01:00,460 --> 01:01:02,240
No, I want to end top 500.

865
01:01:02,740 --> 01:01:06,960
But to be there, I do need to learn all the other support characters.

866
01:01:07,460 --> 01:01:09,440
I became the thing I hated the most.

867
01:01:09,560 --> 01:01:10,420
A fucking one trick.

868
01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:13,520
I can't help it.

869
01:01:13,740 --> 01:01:14,840
I legitimately...

870
01:01:16,280 --> 01:01:17,800
I can't help.

871
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:20,340
I became the one thing I hated the most.

872
01:01:21,220 --> 01:01:23,380
A goddamn one trick.

873
01:01:26,820 --> 01:01:29,320
A fucking one trick.

874
01:01:37,640 --> 01:01:40,560
Yeah, but Jeff is so situational.

875
01:01:41,080 --> 01:01:42,620
I don't think he's that good.

876
01:01:42,620 --> 01:01:43,620
He's not meta.

877
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:44,640
That's the thing.

878
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,400
He's like an off-meta support pick.

879
01:01:47,720 --> 01:01:49,500
Cause he's actually pretty trash.

880
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:54,420
I think my Jeff is decent but he's just not meta.

881
01:01:54,940 --> 01:01:57,800
If he was meta, I would love to play...

882
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:02,820
I would want to play him frequently, but I don't think he is.

883
01:02:06,360 --> 01:02:07,460
That's the only issue.

884
01:02:08,020 --> 01:02:09,160
If he was meta.

885
01:02:09,160 --> 01:02:09,460
Yeah.

886
01:02:11,240 --> 01:02:12,340
Oh my god.

887
01:02:12,420 --> 01:02:13,420
He's so low.

888
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:17,480
He's so low.

889
01:02:17,560 --> 01:02:18,740
I got him so low.

890
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:19,660
Did you guys see that?

891
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:20,980
I got this.

892
01:02:24,080 --> 01:02:30,640
This is what happens when you're a Luna Snow that can aim.

893
01:02:31,880 --> 01:02:33,060
That's right, guys.

894
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:35,340
I'm a Luna Snow that can shoot.

895
01:02:36,320 --> 01:02:37,560
That can defend herself.

896
01:02:40,340 --> 01:02:42,340
I'm not like the other Luna Snows.

897
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:43,700
Okay, I'm sorry.

898
01:02:43,780 --> 01:02:44,540
You got walled off.

899
01:02:44,840 --> 01:02:46,820
I don't know what you want me to do there.

900
01:02:51,620 --> 01:02:52,640
Oh, he's so low.

901
01:02:52,840 --> 01:02:54,700
Not the fucking wall!

902
01:02:56,500 --> 01:02:56,780
Please.

903
01:02:58,040 --> 01:02:58,560
Please.

904
01:02:58,840 --> 01:02:59,320
No!

905
01:02:59,820 --> 01:03:00,840
I need one heal!

906
01:03:01,140 --> 01:03:01,760
I need...

907
01:03:04,940 --> 01:03:06,140
Oh my god.

908
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:06,980
I literally...

909
01:03:06,980 --> 01:03:08,760
I got too cocky there.

910
01:03:08,940 --> 01:03:14,240
I wanted to get the one and then so I could do the... Oh no.

911
01:03:14,760 --> 01:03:17,160
If I didn't die there, I think we could have won that easily.

912
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:20,080
Come on, go in.

913
01:03:20,500 --> 01:03:20,720
No!

914
01:03:22,300 --> 01:03:23,100
Get in here!

915
01:03:25,560 --> 01:03:26,520
Just live!

916
01:03:30,800 --> 01:03:32,480
I'm sorry, but we're so dead.

917
01:03:32,920 --> 01:03:33,640
We're so dead.

918
01:03:33,880 --> 01:03:34,380
I'm sorry.

919
01:03:34,380 --> 01:03:36,160
We're so fucking dead though.

920
01:03:36,280 --> 01:03:37,020
I'm so sorry.

921
01:03:37,100 --> 01:03:38,340
We got walled off again!

922
01:03:38,820 --> 01:03:40,680
We got walled off again!

923
01:03:45,060 --> 01:03:46,680
Oh my god.

924
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:48,300
What a wall combo.

925
01:03:51,240 --> 01:03:52,200
Jesus Christ.

926
01:03:52,280 --> 01:03:54,040
These walls are so... I'm gonna put on a tank.

927
01:03:55,960 --> 01:03:58,240
It might be more... Wait, what?

928
01:03:58,360 --> 01:03:59,060
Why did you ult?

929
01:04:00,640 --> 01:04:02,760
I'm gonna put in a tank because like...

930
01:04:02,760 --> 01:04:04,160
He keeps getting walled off.

931
01:04:06,660 --> 01:04:09,360
It might be easier so I can heal like others.

932
01:04:09,860 --> 01:04:11,100
No, I have to reload.

933
01:04:11,220 --> 01:04:11,840
I'm sorry.

934
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:14,540
No, I have to reload.

935
01:04:14,680 --> 01:04:15,480
I'm so sorry.

936
01:04:16,080 --> 01:04:16,320
Bro!

937
01:04:18,680 --> 01:04:19,920
Oh my god.

938
01:04:20,320 --> 01:04:21,620
No, please no!

939
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:27,620
It's not just a lunar counter.

940
01:04:27,780 --> 01:04:29,500
It's like an everything counter.

941
01:04:32,760 --> 01:04:34,120
I'm getting heavily picked though.

942
01:04:35,060 --> 01:04:41,060
I'm gonna put it on a tank because like our tanks are getting cooking.

943
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:50,760
Yeah.

944
01:04:53,600 --> 01:04:54,840
Don't worry, I got you.

945
01:04:55,800 --> 01:04:58,180
Oh my god, this stupid wall.

946
01:05:00,100 --> 01:05:00,760
Shoot the healer!

947
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:01,100
Shoot the healer!

948
01:05:01,100 --> 01:05:02,640
Let's go!

949
01:05:03,020 --> 01:05:04,200
Let's start the show!

950
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:06,180
Let's fucking go!

951
01:05:06,560 --> 01:05:07,420
Let's go, Strange!

952
01:05:11,380 --> 01:05:13,400
Oh, that is very risky.

953
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:17,080
I'll put on this, Dr. Strange.

954
01:05:18,940 --> 01:05:20,060
Dude, this fucking tree.

955
01:05:20,620 --> 01:05:22,560
This fucking tree though.

956
01:05:23,180 --> 01:05:24,540
He has tree ult.

957
01:05:25,140 --> 01:05:25,940
I can tell.

958
01:05:25,940 --> 01:05:27,460
Focus down this root every time.

959
01:05:30,200 --> 01:05:31,260
Oh my god.

960
01:05:32,140 --> 01:05:33,340
He has the ult.

961
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:35,520
I'm focusing the tree.

962
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:37,420
I'm focusing as hard as I could!

963
01:05:40,700 --> 01:05:41,560
Oh my god.

964
01:05:41,660 --> 01:05:42,400
Please, I have to reload.

965
01:05:43,260 --> 01:05:44,120
Oh no!

966
01:05:45,700 --> 01:05:46,200
No!

967
01:05:47,040 --> 01:05:48,200
You're all so low!

968
01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:51,260
There was nothing I could do!

969
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:56,260
There was nothing I could do!

970
01:05:56,340 --> 01:05:57,100
I'm sorry!

971
01:06:00,980 --> 01:06:03,220
This Groot is so good!

972
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:07,460
The Groot just put the wall down!

973
01:06:08,860 --> 01:06:10,040
I can tell too!

974
01:06:10,640 --> 01:06:13,640
I thought the Mantis would get her ult before.

975
01:06:13,740 --> 01:06:14,700
Oh, I guess she didn't.

976
01:06:14,780 --> 01:06:15,680
She used it already.

977
01:06:16,220 --> 01:06:18,580
I think the key right now...

978
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:20,560
Is that...

979
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:22,740
I saved my ult for Groot's ult.

980
01:06:24,340 --> 01:06:26,460
I had to save my ult for Groot's ult.

981
01:06:26,920 --> 01:06:27,940
There's no other way.

982
01:06:34,140 --> 01:06:34,700
Yeah.

983
01:06:35,140 --> 01:06:37,520
So like, I have to...

984
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:40,220
I have to play more defensively.

985
01:06:43,220 --> 01:06:46,720
Yeah, I think she popped it for Mantis.

986
01:06:46,720 --> 01:06:48,860
It's like Lucio-Zed and double ult together.

987
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:50,260
Which is not good.

988
01:06:54,280 --> 01:06:55,840
Groot is very annoying, yeah.

989
01:06:58,080 --> 01:07:01,200
The Groot-Sylocke combo is very fucking annoying.

990
01:07:02,180 --> 01:07:04,860
I'll put it on the Thor, because he's gonna be flanking a lot.

991
01:07:06,540 --> 01:07:08,660
I usually put it on the DPS, but like...

992
01:07:08,660 --> 01:07:10,720
When we have double tank, I put it on the other tank.

993
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:12,580
So I don't have to worry about healing both tanks.

994
01:07:14,200 --> 01:07:16,660
I can just heal one tank for the price of...

995
01:07:18,280 --> 01:07:20,360
I can heal two tanks for the price of one.

996
01:07:26,280 --> 01:07:28,180
I'm gonna do this, because...

997
01:07:28,180 --> 01:07:29,480
That's like double healing.

998
01:07:29,640 --> 01:07:31,340
Oh my god, good job guys!

999
01:07:32,120 --> 01:07:33,080
Good job!

1000
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:36,940
I do this if they're like super close together.

1001
01:07:38,500 --> 01:07:40,680
So then I know I can do double...

1002
01:07:40,680 --> 01:07:42,520
I can do double the healing.

1003
01:07:44,240 --> 01:07:45,740
Pushing so far up.

1004
01:07:49,040 --> 01:07:49,980
Because it can...

1005
01:07:49,980 --> 01:07:51,020
It...

1006
01:07:51,680 --> 01:07:53,800
It can like combine...

1007
01:07:53,800 --> 01:07:54,920
Oh my god.

1008
01:07:54,940 --> 01:07:55,640
No more?

1009
01:08:02,980 --> 01:08:03,720
It's okay.

1010
01:08:05,380 --> 01:08:05,740
Oh!

1011
01:08:09,610 --> 01:08:11,490
Oh, he is so fucking dead.

1012
01:08:11,890 --> 01:08:12,950
He is so dead.

1013
01:08:14,030 --> 01:08:15,230
There's no way!

1014
01:08:15,770 --> 01:08:16,550
Wait, he's alive!

1015
01:08:18,090 --> 01:08:19,510
Oh my god, he's alive!

1016
01:08:22,270 --> 01:08:23,310
What the...

1017
01:08:23,310 --> 01:08:24,310
Mantis would heal me.

1018
01:08:24,310 --> 01:08:24,350
Heal me!

1019
01:08:29,160 --> 01:08:32,300
No, I literally walked in front of the mantis!

1020
01:08:32,480 --> 01:08:32,840
Hey!

1021
01:08:34,900 --> 01:08:35,340
Sup?

1022
01:08:36,580 --> 01:08:40,260
I literally walked in front of the mantis because I thought I would...

1023
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:42,240
I thought I was gonna get it.

1024
01:08:46,520 --> 01:08:47,340
Oh my god.

1025
01:08:47,580 --> 01:08:48,560
That's a nice portal though.

1026
01:08:48,720 --> 01:08:48,920
Yeah.

1027
01:08:54,140 --> 01:08:55,260
There's a Psylocke there.

1028
01:08:56,660 --> 01:08:57,880
Oh my god, I have to...

1029
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:01,820
I'm trying to keep it for...

1030
01:09:02,760 --> 01:09:04,440
I'm a little scared though.

1031
01:09:10,380 --> 01:09:10,900
Okay.

1032
01:09:14,360 --> 01:09:14,880
Okay.

1033
01:09:15,700 --> 01:09:16,820
I might have to do this.

1034
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:17,940
I don't want them to cap.

1035
01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:21,060
I don't want them to cap so I'm gonna fight on this point.

1036
01:09:21,500 --> 01:09:24,980
I'm gonna fight on this point until I fucking die.

1037
01:09:25,880 --> 01:09:27,580
Okay, I leave now.

1038
01:09:27,980 --> 01:09:28,220
Hahaha.

1039
01:09:28,220 --> 01:09:28,260
Haha.

1040
01:09:30,840 --> 01:09:31,960
Got this.

1041
01:09:33,840 --> 01:09:34,560
I need reload!

1042
01:09:37,480 --> 01:09:38,400
Oh my god!

1043
01:09:38,420 --> 01:09:40,620
How much damage are you taking?!

1044
01:09:40,620 --> 01:09:41,440
No more!

1045
01:09:43,800 --> 01:09:44,520
Nice.

1046
01:09:44,840 --> 01:09:45,120
Alright.

1047
01:09:45,400 --> 01:09:45,680
Yay!

1048
01:09:48,480 --> 01:09:49,720
Let's dance!

1049
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:54,040
Oh my god.

1050
01:09:54,260 --> 01:09:55,860
This game is so stressful.

1051
01:09:57,220 --> 01:09:57,820
Okay.

1052
01:09:58,520 --> 01:09:59,120
Okay.

1053
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:00,680
I have one more round.

1054
01:10:01,380 --> 01:10:03,920
And then you can invite...

1055
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:04,220
Alright.

1056
01:10:04,720 --> 01:10:05,420
Trapper's ready.

1057
01:10:07,980 --> 01:10:08,580
Alright.

1058
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:12,360
This is fine.

1059
01:10:12,720 --> 01:10:13,640
This is so fine.

1060
01:10:14,020 --> 01:10:14,320
Hahaha.

1061
01:10:16,580 --> 01:10:18,640
Yeah, but we're not gonna be in voice VC.

1062
01:10:18,840 --> 01:10:20,240
We're just gonna like...

1063
01:10:20,240 --> 01:10:21,380
Uh...

1064
01:10:21,380 --> 01:10:22,280
We're just gonna be chilling.

1065
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:24,020
Off voice chat.

1066
01:10:27,720 --> 01:10:28,880
Oh my god.

1067
01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:31,180
This is so stressful.

1068
01:10:32,040 --> 01:10:33,780
Okay, I'm gonna put it on Dr. Strange.

1069
01:10:36,060 --> 01:10:39,740
The thing is, what I like about it is that it's not fully cluttered.

1070
01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:42,620
It's not full cluttered.

1071
01:10:42,660 --> 01:10:44,700
Yeah, he's the ace but we have two tanks.

1072
01:10:45,340 --> 01:10:49,340
It's not worth putting it on the more.

1073
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,580
If we have one tank, I put it on the best DPS.

1074
01:10:54,660 --> 01:10:58,860
But since we have two tanks, it's easier to just put it on one tank.

1075
01:10:59,180 --> 01:11:02,400
So I can heal the other tank.

1076
01:11:03,420 --> 01:11:05,440
I don't have to focus on healing both tanks.

1077
01:11:07,480 --> 01:11:12,140
I don't know if that's the right thing, but this is how I feel has worked the best for me.

1078
01:11:12,580 --> 01:11:13,820
Jesus Christ!

1079
01:11:16,420 --> 01:11:16,940
How?!

1080
01:11:18,940 --> 01:11:19,460
How?!

1081
01:11:21,660 --> 01:11:23,660
How are you taking so much damage?!

1082
01:11:27,620 --> 01:11:28,820
Jesus Christ.

1083
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:31,020
I have a point.

1084
01:11:32,980 --> 01:11:33,580
What?!

1085
01:11:33,580 --> 01:11:35,140
Oh my god, it's Hawkeye.

1086
01:11:35,780 --> 01:11:37,060
It's fucking Hawkeye.

1087
01:11:38,140 --> 01:11:39,080
That's how.

1088
01:11:40,160 --> 01:11:41,580
Oh, that makes sense.

1089
01:11:41,900 --> 01:11:43,660
I was like, how?!

1090
01:11:49,740 --> 01:11:51,080
I'll just heal you.

1091
01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:52,480
Don't worry.

1092
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:53,220
Oh, shit!

1093
01:11:57,220 --> 01:11:58,280
Get back in here!

1094
01:11:58,300 --> 01:11:59,280
Get back in here!

1095
01:11:59,420 --> 01:12:05,800
That's the key right?!

1096
01:12:05,800 --> 01:12:06,640
Oh, shit!

1097
01:12:07,260 --> 01:12:08,120
Oh my god, please!

1098
01:12:09,680 --> 01:12:10,640
I'm sorry!

1099
01:12:12,940 --> 01:12:13,820
Let's just push.

1100
01:12:14,820 --> 01:12:16,220
That's the key right?!

1101
01:12:16,220 --> 01:12:18,120
You thought you were the DPS?!

1102
01:12:18,120 --> 01:12:19,340
Get out!

1103
01:12:19,580 --> 01:12:20,880
Get out of here!

1104
01:12:21,340 --> 01:12:22,180
Alright, I panicked.

1105
01:12:22,340 --> 01:12:23,480
I don't know if you noticed.

1106
01:12:23,480 --> 01:12:25,240
I don't know if you noticed.

1107
01:12:25,240 --> 01:12:27,960
I wanted to live after that sick fucking play.

1108
01:12:33,280 --> 01:12:34,780
Yes, I can heal them.

1109
01:12:34,880 --> 01:12:37,540
You're supposed to be the DPS healer?!

1110
01:12:37,540 --> 01:12:39,960
I'm the DPS healer!

1111
01:12:41,080 --> 01:12:47,520
I'm the DPS healer now!

1112
01:12:53,840 --> 01:12:55,900
Oh yeah, I emoted on them too.

1113
01:12:56,020 --> 01:12:56,580
You're right.

1114
01:13:01,480 --> 01:13:04,500
I basically ulted on them out of confidence.

1115
01:13:04,520 --> 01:13:05,860
Because I was like, that's the key right?

1116
01:13:05,900 --> 01:13:06,460
That's me.

1117
01:13:07,480 --> 01:13:08,180
I'm her.

1118
01:13:10,840 --> 01:13:12,040
I'm fucking her.

1119
01:13:13,780 --> 01:13:14,440
Oh, shit.

1120
01:13:16,860 --> 01:13:18,300
I think we're fine, right?

1121
01:13:19,100 --> 01:13:19,760
We're not.

1122
01:13:19,880 --> 01:13:20,880
Oh wait, they're on point.

1123
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:22,340
Guys, they're on point.

1124
01:13:28,080 --> 01:13:29,480
I know!

1125
01:13:33,040 --> 01:13:34,740
Please, I know!

1126
01:13:35,280 --> 01:13:36,660
I'm so low!

1127
01:13:39,520 --> 01:13:40,240
Okay,

1128
01:13:47,360 --> 01:13:48,400
now I have ult.

1129
01:13:52,420 --> 01:13:54,240
Oh my god, I just got it.

1130
01:13:55,240 --> 01:13:56,740
We still have point though.

1131
01:13:56,940 --> 01:13:58,060
No, we don't.

1132
01:13:58,340 --> 01:13:58,440
JK.

1133
01:14:12,740 --> 01:14:15,000
What the fuck are they talking about?

1134
01:14:15,100 --> 01:14:15,960
Why are they mad?

1135
01:14:17,340 --> 01:14:18,460
Why mad?

1136
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:19,920
Oh my god!

1137
01:14:22,900 --> 01:14:24,180
Get in!

1138
01:14:24,380 --> 01:14:24,760
Get in!

1139
01:14:25,560 --> 01:14:25,760
Get in!

1140
01:14:25,760 --> 01:14:26,220
This is it!

1141
01:14:26,320 --> 01:14:27,120
This is the push!

1142
01:14:28,980 --> 01:14:30,100
This is it!

1143
01:14:30,540 --> 01:14:31,920
This is the push!

1144
01:14:32,440 --> 01:14:33,720
This is the Lucio beat!

1145
01:14:34,840 --> 01:14:36,900
We got the Lucio beat in!

1146
01:14:37,820 --> 01:14:39,240
The girls are fighting.

1147
01:14:43,960 --> 01:14:45,240
Left side!

1148
01:14:46,720 --> 01:14:47,740
I'm scared.

1149
01:14:47,740 --> 01:14:49,280
I'm scared, hello?

1150
01:14:53,510 --> 01:14:54,490
I'm scared.

1151
01:14:55,190 --> 01:14:56,190
They're coming over.

1152
01:14:56,290 --> 01:14:56,870
I froze him.

1153
01:14:59,390 --> 01:15:00,530
Oh, I'm scared.

1154
01:15:00,630 --> 01:15:01,450
I'm definitely scared.

1155
01:15:02,630 --> 01:15:03,930
Oh my god!

1156
01:15:04,430 --> 01:15:05,950
Oh, you're alive!

1157
01:15:06,330 --> 01:15:06,650
Oh!

1158
01:15:07,990 --> 01:15:09,010
I'm alive.

1159
01:15:11,710 --> 01:15:12,770
Oh, he's ready.

1160
01:15:14,830 --> 01:15:17,590
I froze her, but it doesn't work because she's in the ult.

1161
01:15:21,930 --> 01:15:23,450
Oh, I'm trying!

1162
01:15:25,890 --> 01:15:27,290
Go, go, attack!

1163
01:15:29,110 --> 01:15:30,210
That's fucking right.

1164
01:15:30,490 --> 01:15:31,090
We're gamers.

1165
01:15:31,490 --> 01:15:32,870
We're fucking gamers.

1166
01:15:33,090 --> 01:15:33,690
Let's go.

1167
01:15:34,270 --> 01:15:35,090
See you guys.

1168
01:15:36,090 --> 01:15:37,550
That's how you play Luna.

1169
01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:43,780
No, she's basically Lucio Zen.

1170
01:15:43,880 --> 01:15:45,080
That's why it's so easy.

1171
01:15:45,120 --> 01:15:47,500
Like, I can transition to Luna very well.

1172
01:15:47,820 --> 01:15:50,800
Because I can play both Lucio and Zenyatta.

1173
01:15:54,660 --> 01:15:57,760
I want to say to that fucking Mantis, get fucked.

1174
01:16:00,340 --> 01:16:04,620
That fucking Mantis, that was like, I can totally take her.

1175
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:06,180
Get fucking shit on.

1176
01:16:11,140 --> 01:16:12,320
That's looking right.

1177
01:16:13,180 --> 01:16:15,020
Okay, I'm ready.

1178
01:16:19,480 --> 01:16:19,720
I'm ready.

1179
01:16:20,260 --> 01:16:20,740
Exactly.

1180
01:16:22,140 --> 01:16:23,060
I can't believe it.

1181
01:16:23,220 --> 01:16:25,640
Mantis is supposed to be the DPS player.

1182
01:16:25,780 --> 01:16:26,840
What the fuck happened?

1183
01:16:27,060 --> 01:16:27,280
Huh?

1184
01:16:27,640 --> 01:16:28,740
What the fuck happened?

1185
01:16:31,180 --> 01:16:32,420
Alright, let's see.

1186
01:16:34,120 --> 01:16:36,040
I don't want to be the one to request.

1187
01:16:36,820 --> 01:16:38,000
I don't like queuing up.

1188
01:16:38,060 --> 01:16:39,140
I want him to queue up.

1189
01:16:42,100 --> 01:16:43,060
Invite whenever.

1190
01:16:44,680 --> 01:16:45,160
Alright.

1191
01:16:45,160 --> 01:16:45,380
Alright.

1192
01:16:47,120 --> 01:16:47,920
Invite whenever.

1193
01:16:53,410 --> 01:16:54,310
Where he at?

1194
01:16:54,970 --> 01:16:55,910
Where the fuck is he?

1195
01:16:55,910 --> 01:16:57,110
He's buying skins?

1196
01:16:57,290 --> 01:16:58,870
Are you serious?

1197
01:17:00,070 --> 01:17:01,850
He's buying skins.

1198
01:17:02,190 --> 01:17:04,330
I don't like Luna's skins.

1199
01:17:05,190 --> 01:17:06,170
I don't like it.

1200
01:17:06,310 --> 01:17:07,770
I like her current outfit.

1201
01:17:07,930 --> 01:17:09,930
But to be fair, I don't like dresses in general.

1202
01:17:10,090 --> 01:17:11,790
So like, I think that's why.

1203
01:17:12,110 --> 01:17:14,090
I don't like, I mean, I don't like it.

1204
01:17:14,330 --> 01:17:14,710
I don't know.

1205
01:17:14,730 --> 01:17:15,930
I don't really like this green color.

1206
01:17:15,930 --> 01:17:17,830
I like this outfit more.

1207
01:17:18,410 --> 01:17:19,930
I don't like this outfit.

1208
01:17:20,270 --> 01:17:23,210
I'm not like a huge fan of like these types of dresses.

1209
01:17:24,310 --> 01:17:24,810
I think.

1210
01:17:25,050 --> 01:17:30,310
I do like certain types of dresses, but like, I'm not a fan of this type of, this cosmetic.

1211
01:17:31,190 --> 01:17:32,370
I think this one's cuter.

1212
01:17:33,990 --> 01:17:35,910
I think this skin is a lot cuter.

1213
01:17:37,230 --> 01:17:38,570
No, I like girly stuff.

1214
01:17:38,650 --> 01:17:39,690
I just don't like this dress.

1215
01:17:40,070 --> 01:17:42,450
I find this dress to be not appealing to me.

1216
01:17:43,190 --> 01:17:44,730
I don't know, I don't like this color of green.

1217
01:17:45,990 --> 01:17:47,310
Cause like, asparagus.

1218
01:17:47,650 --> 01:17:49,450
Yuck, cause it reminds me of vegetables.

1219
01:17:50,830 --> 01:17:51,310
Disgusting.

1220
01:17:55,830 --> 01:17:56,670
It's hot.

1221
01:17:57,190 --> 01:17:59,350
Yeah, it reminds me of vegetables.

1222
01:17:59,850 --> 01:18:01,330
And I hate vegetables.

1223
01:18:01,870 --> 01:18:02,350
Yuck.

1224
01:18:03,190 --> 01:18:05,050
Doki, are you like five or something?

1225
01:18:09,830 --> 01:18:11,130
I'm just not a fan.

1226
01:18:11,130 --> 01:18:12,210
What can I say?

1227
01:18:12,690 --> 01:18:14,130
Just not a fan of this color.

1228
01:18:15,170 --> 01:18:16,810
Eat your veggies, Doki.

1229
01:18:17,250 --> 01:18:21,170
I don't get a lot of MVPs too, so it's like, there's no point.

1230
01:18:21,430 --> 01:18:23,870
There's no point in getting any of the cosmetics.

1231
01:18:25,610 --> 01:18:27,650
Doki, eat your broccoli.

1232
01:18:30,550 --> 01:18:32,090
I'm here for lasagna.

1233
01:18:32,830 --> 01:18:33,850
Alright, nice.

1234
01:18:34,410 --> 01:18:35,790
It's time to game, gamers.

1235
01:18:37,550 --> 01:18:38,010
Alright.

1236
01:18:38,010 --> 01:18:38,230
Alright.

1237
01:18:38,850 --> 01:18:39,790
Where's his rank?

1238
01:18:40,090 --> 01:18:41,250
Wait, he's plat 2?

1239
01:18:41,490 --> 01:18:42,150
He climbed?

1240
01:18:43,870 --> 01:18:45,990
Wait, what exactly plat 2?

1241
01:18:46,690 --> 01:18:47,550
Oh shit, we're in.

1242
01:18:48,590 --> 01:18:49,770
Did he just rank up?

1243
01:18:51,730 --> 01:18:52,850
He climbed?!

1244
01:18:52,850 --> 01:18:54,930
Oh my god, he was silver before!

1245
01:18:55,470 --> 01:18:56,430
He was silver!

1246
01:19:02,010 --> 01:19:06,370
Oh my god, I was the gold and he was the silver.

1247
01:19:06,550 --> 01:19:06,850
No!

1248
01:19:07,730 --> 01:19:10,010
Oh no, it's time for Jeff, I guess.

1249
01:19:10,610 --> 01:19:12,530
Oh my god, do we have like 3 Luna players?

1250
01:19:12,910 --> 01:19:16,870
Oh no, I guess we're gonna avoid this person.

1251
01:19:18,330 --> 01:19:19,650
We have 3!

1252
01:19:19,950 --> 01:19:21,090
This is bad!

1253
01:19:21,550 --> 01:19:23,830
We have too many Luna players!

1254
01:19:23,990 --> 01:19:26,850
Why do we have so many support players?!

1255
01:19:26,850 --> 01:19:27,330
No!

1256
01:19:27,330 --> 01:19:27,630
No!

1257
01:19:31,410 --> 01:19:33,030
Oh wait, it's plats and 1.

1258
01:19:33,110 --> 01:19:34,150
Oh it is!

1259
01:19:34,270 --> 01:19:35,390
Wait, it is!

1260
01:19:36,230 --> 01:19:38,010
Wait, this is a streamer lobby!

1261
01:19:38,550 --> 01:19:41,670
What the fuck?!

1262
01:19:41,670 --> 01:19:46,050
This is actually a streamer lobby.

1263
01:19:46,170 --> 01:19:48,050
Wait, we have the full streamer lobby!

1264
01:19:48,370 --> 01:19:49,590
Let's fucking go!

1265
01:19:50,990 --> 01:19:52,430
Yeah, we're streamers.

1266
01:19:53,710 --> 01:19:58,010
Guys, we're gonna lose this streamer lobby, I can feel it.

1267
01:20:00,890 --> 01:20:03,450
We're gonna lose the streamer lobby.

1268
01:20:07,290 --> 01:20:10,450
This is a Overwatch lobby.

1269
01:20:11,290 --> 01:20:13,110
Our team is full Overwatch.

1270
01:20:15,250 --> 01:20:17,630
This game is gonna be on YouTube!

1271
01:20:18,450 --> 01:20:20,470
This map again?!

1272
01:20:20,470 --> 01:20:22,190
I'm fucking so tired!

1273
01:20:22,190 --> 01:20:23,850
Why?!

1274
01:20:23,850 --> 01:20:26,050
I played 3 games!

1275
01:20:27,470 --> 01:20:29,230
And all of them were this map!

1276
01:20:29,390 --> 01:20:31,330
This is so stupid!

1277
01:20:36,730 --> 01:20:39,550
I'm so tired.

1278
01:20:40,530 --> 01:20:41,870
I'm so tired.

1279
01:20:46,530 --> 01:20:48,150
Jesus Christ.

1280
01:20:50,270 --> 01:20:52,290
Oh, okay, goodbye I guess.

1281
01:20:53,130 --> 01:20:53,650
Goodbye.

1282
01:21:00,260 --> 01:21:00,780
Alright.

1283
01:21:02,740 --> 01:21:04,360
I wanna shoot my gun too!

1284
01:21:05,880 --> 01:21:07,240
I wanna shoot my mouth!

1285
01:21:10,160 --> 01:21:11,080
Oh my god.

1286
01:21:14,840 --> 01:21:16,080
Oh my god, I have to reload!

1287
01:21:16,360 --> 01:21:17,260
I have to reload my mouth!

1288
01:21:17,300 --> 01:21:17,760
I'm sorry!

1289
01:21:18,960 --> 01:21:20,460
I have to feed myself!

1290
01:21:21,720 --> 01:21:25,920
I have to feed myself!

1291
01:21:25,920 --> 01:21:28,140
I gotta keep feeding my mouth!

1292
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:33,480
Okay, nice.

1293
01:21:35,640 --> 01:21:37,580
How did we get into full streamer lobby?

1294
01:21:37,720 --> 01:21:38,560
That's crazy.

1295
01:21:41,780 --> 01:21:43,240
I'm avoiding their Luna snow.

1296
01:21:43,920 --> 01:21:45,660
I'm gonna avoid all the Luna snows I see.

1297
01:21:47,020 --> 01:21:48,480
It's the only way to go.

1298
01:21:49,780 --> 01:21:50,720
Oh my god.

1299
01:21:52,740 --> 01:21:54,700
Jesus Christ, how did he die?

1300
01:21:58,620 --> 01:21:59,460
Okay, guys.

1301
01:21:59,580 --> 01:22:01,220
Oh my god!

1302
01:22:01,820 --> 01:22:03,740
Alright, I can't save that!

1303
01:22:04,900 --> 01:22:06,800
Bro, I don't know what you want me to do!

1304
01:22:06,880 --> 01:22:07,860
I'm spitting my mouth!

1305
01:22:08,980 --> 01:22:11,340
Like, look at all the balloons I'm giving you!

1306
01:22:11,580 --> 01:22:12,800
Look at all these bubbles!

1307
01:22:15,580 --> 01:22:16,340
Nice, okay.

1308
01:22:17,360 --> 01:22:19,080
I'm giving so many bubbles!

1309
01:22:22,140 --> 01:22:24,380
Okay, I can ult, but like, I don't know.

1310
01:22:24,900 --> 01:22:28,020
I feel like this ult is so...

1311
01:22:28,880 --> 01:22:30,460
I'll just eat the ult.

1312
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:35,360
Goodbye.

1313
01:22:36,320 --> 01:22:37,360
I'm just gonna spit you out.

1314
01:22:39,420 --> 01:22:39,860
Goodbye.

1315
01:22:41,780 --> 01:22:42,340
Goodbye.

1316
01:22:43,780 --> 01:22:45,480
There's an enemy coming in!

1317
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:46,500
I'm sorry!

1318
01:22:47,080 --> 01:22:49,060
I took him as far as I could go!

1319
01:22:53,740 --> 01:22:53,980
Goodbye.

1320
01:22:54,360 --> 01:22:55,280
We're halfway there.

1321
01:22:55,760 --> 01:22:57,440
There, I'm spitting bubbles at you!

1322
01:22:58,140 --> 01:22:58,940
Take the bubble!

1323
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:01,020
I'm gonna get rid of this guy too.

1324
01:23:01,400 --> 01:23:02,140
This guy's annoying.

1325
01:23:03,020 --> 01:23:03,320
Alright.

1326
01:23:06,980 --> 01:23:08,000
You're fine!

1327
01:23:08,760 --> 01:23:10,540
I have no more bubbles, but you're fine!

1328
01:23:14,860 --> 01:23:16,980
I'm fucking... I'm spitting!

1329
01:23:18,320 --> 01:23:18,700
Bubble!

1330
01:23:19,640 --> 01:23:21,160
Oh my god.

1331
01:23:21,160 --> 01:23:23,840
Oh my god.

1332
01:23:23,840 --> 01:23:24,740
I'm sorry, bro.

1333
01:23:28,840 --> 01:23:29,800
Holy fuck.

1334
01:23:30,660 --> 01:23:32,280
I might have to...

1335
01:23:32,280 --> 01:23:34,820
Okay, after my ult, I'll play a different character.

1336
01:23:35,340 --> 01:23:36,960
He's so situational, I know.

1337
01:23:37,080 --> 01:23:38,260
That's why I was like...

1338
01:23:38,260 --> 01:23:40,500
I use my ult if it's a team fight.

1339
01:23:40,680 --> 01:23:43,180
And then I can get rid of people during my team fight.

1340
01:23:47,080 --> 01:23:49,400
I could try Mantis.

1341
01:23:51,160 --> 01:23:52,640
Okay, that's unfortunate.

1342
01:23:53,040 --> 01:23:53,520
Right there.

1343
01:23:54,780 --> 01:23:56,360
That's very unfortunate.

1344
01:23:59,480 --> 01:24:02,520
I don't know what you want us to do.

1345
01:24:03,460 --> 01:24:05,180
Oh my god!

1346
01:24:05,780 --> 01:24:07,100
Oh my god, Surefour!

1347
01:24:07,220 --> 01:24:08,460
Just take all the bubbles!

1348
01:24:09,160 --> 01:24:11,500
I literally have so many bubbles for you!

1349
01:24:11,860 --> 01:24:13,100
Oh my god!

1350
01:24:13,220 --> 01:24:13,900
Surefour!

1351
01:24:14,400 --> 01:24:15,900
I don't know what you want!

1352
01:24:19,420 --> 01:24:20,380
I think...

1353
01:24:20,380 --> 01:24:20,960
You know what?

1354
01:24:21,020 --> 01:24:22,800
We might as well just run three support.

1355
01:24:22,900 --> 01:24:24,900
Because I don't think Jazzy...

1356
01:24:24,900 --> 01:24:26,620
Oh wait, Jazzy's ace.

1357
01:24:26,700 --> 01:24:27,900
But I thought he was a Luna player.

1358
01:24:29,980 --> 01:24:30,940
Jesus Christ.

1359
01:24:32,240 --> 01:24:33,280
Oh my god.

1360
01:24:34,060 --> 01:24:34,540
Guys.

1361
01:24:37,280 --> 01:24:38,580
Oh my god, guys.

1362
01:24:39,080 --> 01:24:40,160
I can't...

1363
01:24:40,160 --> 01:24:42,240
I can't!

1364
01:24:42,240 --> 01:24:44,040
I've been spitting!

1365
01:24:44,520 --> 01:24:45,960
All I do is spit!

1366
01:24:49,780 --> 01:24:52,860
All I do is just fucking upload!

1367
01:24:59,180 --> 01:24:59,940
Go!

1368
01:25:00,180 --> 01:25:01,200
Take the bubble!

1369
01:25:02,240 --> 01:25:03,380
Oh my god.

1370
01:25:03,400 --> 01:25:04,640
That's unfortunate for him.

1371
01:25:05,320 --> 01:25:06,800
Maybe I do lowkey...

1372
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:07,960
I don't think I should.

1373
01:25:13,710 --> 01:25:14,470
Okay.

1374
01:25:17,270 --> 01:25:17,670
Okay.

1375
01:25:25,520 --> 01:25:25,960
There we

1376
01:25:33,760 --> 01:25:35,680
go.

1377
01:25:36,340 --> 01:25:37,480
I was hoping to kill him.

1378
01:25:39,760 --> 01:25:40,160
Okay.

1379
01:25:41,480 --> 01:25:43,260
Sorry, I had to kill...

1380
01:25:43,260 --> 01:25:44,040
Sorry, I had to...

1381
01:25:44,040 --> 01:25:46,360
I had to work on killing the Hawkeye.

1382
01:25:46,560 --> 01:25:47,880
I'm sorry I couldn't help you, bro.

1383
01:25:48,980 --> 01:25:49,860
I'm gonna swap.

1384
01:25:50,480 --> 01:25:50,960
Hahaha.

1385
01:25:52,600 --> 01:25:53,920
I go swap healers.

1386
01:25:54,500 --> 01:25:55,600
Boom, boom.

1387
01:25:55,780 --> 01:25:56,760
Alright, let's try it.

1388
01:25:57,040 --> 01:25:58,020
Let's learn her live!

1389
01:25:58,460 --> 01:25:59,880
We're gonna learn her live!

1390
01:26:00,100 --> 01:26:01,980
I don't know how to play her, but we're gonna...

1391
01:26:01,980 --> 01:26:04,980
Oh, but at least we get to look at something nice, I guess.

1392
01:26:05,660 --> 01:26:06,140
Like...

1393
01:26:07,320 --> 01:26:09,160
We're gonna learn her live!

1394
01:26:11,080 --> 01:26:12,880
We're gonna learn her live!

1395
01:26:15,960 --> 01:26:16,980
That's looking right!

1396
01:26:17,780 --> 01:26:18,940
We'll figure this out!

1397
01:26:25,310 --> 01:26:27,270
We're gonna learn her live!

1398
01:26:29,190 --> 01:26:29,770
We're gonna learn her live!

1399
01:26:29,770 --> 01:26:32,370
I don't know how to play her, but we're gonna learn her today!

1400
01:26:39,370 --> 01:26:41,630
I don't know what I'm doing!

1401
01:26:51,420 --> 01:26:52,000
Okay.

1402
01:26:57,060 --> 01:26:58,440
Oh my god!

1403
01:26:58,580 --> 01:26:58,860
How?

1404
01:27:00,860 --> 01:27:02,010
Oh my god!

1405
01:27:04,860 --> 01:27:05,460
Random!

1406
01:27:05,840 --> 01:27:06,440
Hahaha.

1407
01:27:07,100 --> 01:27:11,620
You got killed two people!

1408
01:27:16,950 --> 01:27:17,970
Oh my god.

1409
01:27:22,330 --> 01:27:23,230
It's okay.

1410
01:27:23,530 --> 01:27:25,090
I'm learning her live.

1411
01:27:25,430 --> 01:27:25,510
Hahaha.

1412
01:27:26,570 --> 01:27:27,170
Alright.

1413
01:27:29,310 --> 01:27:30,170
Do we learn Mantis?

1414
01:27:30,210 --> 01:27:30,470
Okay.

1415
01:27:30,610 --> 01:27:32,470
Cloaker, Dagger, or Mantis, guys.

1416
01:27:32,850 --> 01:27:34,030
Who do we learn live?

1417
01:27:34,210 --> 01:27:34,690
Hahaha.

1418
01:27:34,690 --> 01:27:36,390
Which one?

1419
01:27:36,730 --> 01:27:37,870
Who do you think I...

1420
01:27:37,870 --> 01:27:40,150
Who do you think I would do the best on?

1421
01:27:41,030 --> 01:27:42,550
When we're learning...

1422
01:27:42,550 --> 01:27:44,530
Mantis should be... Okay, we'll learn...

1423
01:27:44,530 --> 01:27:46,690
We'll learn...

1424
01:27:48,990 --> 01:27:49,570
Mantis?

1425
01:27:49,890 --> 01:27:51,510
Cloaker, Dagger, or Mantis?

1426
01:27:52,150 --> 01:27:53,710
Okay, we'll try Mantis.

1427
01:27:55,870 --> 01:27:57,490
Cloaker, Dagger...

1428
01:27:57,490 --> 01:27:57,910
Hahaha.

1429
01:28:01,170 --> 01:28:03,730
I just have a feeling that like...

1430
01:28:03,730 --> 01:28:05,450
Wait, I was one hit with four kills.

1431
01:28:05,670 --> 01:28:06,890
You're an Overwatch player.

1432
01:28:07,670 --> 01:28:11,470
Bro, that jazzy kid who is a support main, he was like, please just give me Luna.

1433
01:28:12,430 --> 01:28:14,490
Because I need to avoid the Luna...

1434
01:28:14,490 --> 01:28:15,650
The two Luna players.

1435
01:28:18,790 --> 01:28:20,590
Okay, we'll figure this out.

1436
01:28:22,310 --> 01:28:24,470
Dagger, give us a better view.

1437
01:28:24,530 --> 01:28:26,790
Guys, who would help us win?

1438
01:28:27,250 --> 01:28:27,550
Guys!

1439
01:28:28,090 --> 01:28:30,430
This is like the streamer lobby here.

1440
01:28:32,990 --> 01:28:36,310
Oh my god, I'm in elo hell right now.

1441
01:28:38,530 --> 01:28:39,510
Alright, here we go.

1442
01:28:39,550 --> 01:28:40,310
Let's figure this out.

1443
01:28:40,670 --> 01:28:41,490
Alright, surefour.

1444
01:28:41,790 --> 01:28:45,230
I think you're gonna get a headshot.

1445
01:28:52,400 --> 01:28:54,260
Okay, did he do it?

1446
01:28:54,860 --> 01:28:55,060
Hahaha.

1447
01:28:56,120 --> 01:28:57,380
Guys, did he get it?

1448
01:28:57,860 --> 01:29:00,980
I think you're still gonna... Okay, I'm gonna fucking heal you though.

1449
01:29:01,140 --> 01:29:02,220
Oh my god, he did it!

1450
01:29:02,500 --> 01:29:04,200
I fucking told you guys.

1451
01:29:04,920 --> 01:29:06,080
I knew it.

1452
01:29:06,180 --> 01:29:06,460
What?

1453
01:29:07,140 --> 01:29:07,460
Ow.

1454
01:29:09,760 --> 01:29:12,100
Okay guys, I need you guys to back up now.

1455
01:29:15,100 --> 01:29:15,780
Okay.

1456
01:29:18,820 --> 01:29:19,500
Okay.

1457
01:29:23,190 --> 01:29:23,870
Okay.

1458
01:29:30,550 --> 01:29:31,330
Oh my god.

1459
01:29:32,290 --> 01:29:34,370
Okay, I'm gonna inspire to...

1460
01:29:34,370 --> 01:29:35,490
WHAT THE FUCK?!

1461
01:29:35,490 --> 01:29:40,940
HOLY SHIT!

1462
01:29:40,940 --> 01:29:43,540
I didn't expect all of them to be there.

1463
01:29:43,820 --> 01:29:46,520
I was like, I'm inspiring you, please.

1464
01:29:47,540 --> 01:29:48,540
Be inspired.

1465
01:29:48,780 --> 01:29:50,020
Oh yeah, I didn't remember my sleep.

1466
01:29:50,400 --> 01:29:51,700
I forgot my shift.

1467
01:29:51,860 --> 01:29:52,920
Oh my god, I could've slept in.

1468
01:29:53,280 --> 01:29:54,500
Okay, thanks for reminding me.

1469
01:29:55,180 --> 01:29:57,040
I actually forgot about my sleep move.

1470
01:29:58,120 --> 01:29:59,240
I legitimately forgot.

1471
01:30:00,540 --> 01:30:02,460
I don't play...

1472
01:30:02,460 --> 01:30:03,380
inspire you.

1473
01:30:03,680 --> 01:30:05,280
Now get that headshot.

1474
01:30:07,680 --> 01:30:09,680
Oh my god, I fucking knew it.

1475
01:30:13,310 --> 01:30:13,870
Okay.

1476
01:30:16,710 --> 01:30:17,270
Alright.

1477
01:30:17,950 --> 01:30:19,970
And then, get that headshot again!

1478
01:30:22,590 --> 01:30:25,890
Oh okay, so it's like a explosive.

1479
01:30:26,670 --> 01:30:27,890
Okay, that's good to know.

1480
01:30:28,530 --> 01:30:29,330
Okay, now I know.

1481
01:30:30,050 --> 01:30:30,590
Alright.

1482
01:30:34,090 --> 01:30:36,350
Okay, I know that...

1483
01:30:36,350 --> 01:30:38,050
Okay, I'm gonna hit something though.

1484
01:30:38,470 --> 01:30:39,830
I don't have a lot of heals.

1485
01:30:44,290 --> 01:30:45,810
Don't worry, I'm gonna spy...

1486
01:30:45,810 --> 01:30:46,210
Oh shit.

1487
01:30:47,270 --> 01:30:47,790
No!

1488
01:30:48,190 --> 01:30:49,610
There's someone behind me!

1489
01:30:50,990 --> 01:30:52,150
There's flankers!

1490
01:30:56,400 --> 01:30:57,340
Oh no.

1491
01:30:57,880 --> 01:30:58,620
Don't worry, I have my ult.

1492
01:30:59,020 --> 01:31:00,060
I'm coming back!

1493
01:31:02,260 --> 01:31:03,740
I'm coming back!

1494
01:31:04,620 --> 01:31:06,800
I will ult if I need to!

1495
01:31:12,950 --> 01:31:14,510
Okay, we gotta go in though.

1496
01:31:14,890 --> 01:31:15,930
Oh, what the fuck?

1497
01:31:16,010 --> 01:31:16,850
Okay, nevermind.

1498
01:31:16,850 --> 01:31:18,930
I'm gonna stay over here.

1499
01:31:21,010 --> 01:31:22,830
Okay, this is...

1500
01:31:22,830 --> 01:31:23,170
Okay.

1501
01:31:24,590 --> 01:31:25,630
I'm just...

1502
01:31:25,630 --> 01:31:29,850
Come on, let's go in, guys!

1503
01:31:30,150 --> 01:31:31,650
Okay, I...

1504
01:31:32,730 --> 01:31:34,170
Oh my god!

1505
01:31:34,970 --> 01:31:36,010
What the fuck?

1506
01:31:39,950 --> 01:31:42,690
Okay, I died so fast in my ult.

1507
01:31:44,110 --> 01:31:46,310
Wait, we had three ults?!

1508
01:31:46,310 --> 01:31:47,930
We had three ults!

1509
01:31:56,050 --> 01:32:00,130
Oh my god, everybody just kept getting picked!

1510
01:32:04,770 --> 01:32:06,710
Everybody kept getting picked!

1511
01:32:06,770 --> 01:32:08,130
It's alright, I'm still positive.

1512
01:32:08,850 --> 01:32:09,550
Alright, let's see.

1513
01:32:10,210 --> 01:32:11,770
I gotta avoid all the Luna snow.

1514
01:32:12,390 --> 01:32:14,190
This is a detriment to me.

1515
01:32:14,430 --> 01:32:17,070
This is actually...

1516
01:32:17,070 --> 01:32:17,550
Okay.

1517
01:32:17,850 --> 01:32:19,470
No, did I avoid them in time?

1518
01:32:19,650 --> 01:32:19,850
I did!

1519
01:32:20,050 --> 01:32:21,570
No, I avoided them in time!

1520
01:32:21,950 --> 01:32:23,330
No, please don't play me!

1521
01:32:23,430 --> 01:32:24,110
Oh, thank god!

1522
01:32:24,570 --> 01:32:25,350
Oh, thank god!

1523
01:32:25,450 --> 01:32:27,030
Okay, we avoided them in time.

1524
01:32:29,250 --> 01:32:29,690
Okay.

1525
01:32:31,230 --> 01:32:32,450
Alright, that's good.

1526
01:32:32,670 --> 01:32:33,890
Guys, no, you don't understand.

1527
01:32:35,170 --> 01:32:36,330
I'm in too deep.

1528
01:32:37,310 --> 01:32:39,170
I don't know how many people you can avoid.

1529
01:32:39,490 --> 01:32:40,450
I'm in too deep.

1530
01:32:41,530 --> 01:32:42,410
Me playing...

1531
01:32:42,410 --> 01:32:47,450
Unless I play Jeff, me playing other healers will not be good for the team.

1532
01:32:48,330 --> 01:32:50,430
I literally am just Jeff or Luna.

1533
01:32:50,990 --> 01:32:52,670
But Jeff is like...

1534
01:32:52,670 --> 01:32:54,450
Jeff is just...

1535
01:32:54,450 --> 01:32:56,170
Not good!

1536
01:33:01,050 --> 01:33:02,870
He's just not good!

1537
01:33:03,250 --> 01:33:04,390
What can I say?

1538
01:33:10,770 --> 01:33:12,410
I need to...

1539
01:33:12,410 --> 01:33:14,230
I need to learn Mantis!

1540
01:33:14,810 --> 01:33:16,110
I like how like...

1541
01:33:16,110 --> 01:33:17,830
I say that and then we have a Jeff now.

1542
01:33:18,090 --> 01:33:19,870
We have a Jeff with us.

1543
01:33:20,450 --> 01:33:22,810
We had like two... we had three Luna players.

1544
01:33:26,090 --> 01:33:28,710
Literally the Jazzy guy also wanted to play Luna.

1545
01:33:29,410 --> 01:33:29,790
Alright.

1546
01:33:30,650 --> 01:33:31,510
And that dude's okay.

1547
01:33:31,770 --> 01:33:33,770
And then I do that and then he'll never die.

1548
01:33:35,390 --> 01:33:37,090
That's basically what I do.

1549
01:33:37,290 --> 01:33:38,610
If I play a duo with somebody.

1550
01:33:41,430 --> 01:33:43,410
Don't be mean to Jeff!

1551
01:33:45,170 --> 01:33:45,670
Alright.

1552
01:33:46,730 --> 01:33:47,550
It's fine.

1553
01:33:48,030 --> 01:33:48,870
We can do this.

1554
01:33:48,970 --> 01:33:49,770
I believe in us.

1555
01:33:49,830 --> 01:33:51,330
I think we can get to top 500.

1556
01:33:51,930 --> 01:33:53,410
We were just very unlucky.

1557
01:33:56,530 --> 01:33:57,710
We're very unlucky.

1558
01:33:58,330 --> 01:33:59,110
We can do it here.

1559
01:34:00,090 --> 01:34:00,470
Okay.

1560
01:34:03,110 --> 01:34:05,830
Okay, but my Luna gameplay is pretty fucking sick though.

1561
01:34:05,870 --> 01:34:06,410
You gotta admit.

1562
01:34:09,590 --> 01:34:10,690
You gotta admit.

1563
01:34:10,910 --> 01:34:12,290
It's pretty fucking sick.

1564
01:34:26,070 --> 01:34:26,490
Okay.

1565
01:34:27,330 --> 01:34:30,150
There's all of us here, so this is like...

1566
01:34:30,150 --> 01:34:31,030
We should just do this.

1567
01:34:33,630 --> 01:34:38,390
Oh my god, how many fucking...

1568
01:34:38,390 --> 01:34:40,510
Oh, I missed the ice.

1569
01:34:44,210 --> 01:34:44,630
Okay.

1570
01:34:45,970 --> 01:34:47,510
See, I don't have to heal him ever again.

1571
01:34:47,510 --> 01:34:49,690
I literally don't have to give a fuck about him.

1572
01:34:51,310 --> 01:34:52,310
What the fuck?

1573
01:34:52,470 --> 01:34:53,750
We have a Ironman?

1574
01:34:54,510 --> 01:34:57,090
I literally don't even have to look at him most of the time.

1575
01:34:57,830 --> 01:34:58,430
Get this out.

1576
01:34:59,010 --> 01:34:59,790
Actually, get this out.

1577
01:34:59,990 --> 01:35:01,250
I can't see!

1578
01:35:01,870 --> 01:35:03,350
Get this fucking thing out.

1579
01:35:08,060 --> 01:35:08,500
Jesus.

1580
01:35:08,720 --> 01:35:10,040
Jesus Christ!

1581
01:35:15,820 --> 01:35:16,260
Okay.

1582
01:35:19,140 --> 01:35:20,420
Oh, get over here.

1583
01:35:20,420 --> 01:35:23,780
I had to look at him because nobody else was taking damage.

1584
01:35:27,100 --> 01:35:28,040
It's fine.

1585
01:35:32,590 --> 01:35:34,070
Okay, we got the wrath.

1586
01:35:36,050 --> 01:35:37,110
We have Sniper?

1587
01:35:37,270 --> 01:35:37,570
Really?

1588
01:35:37,770 --> 01:35:38,310
Widowmaker?

1589
01:35:38,990 --> 01:35:42,530
As long as our Magneto takes damage, Short Fork gets healed!

1590
01:35:43,090 --> 01:35:44,110
That's the plan!

1591
01:35:44,450 --> 01:35:44,770
Oh!

1592
01:35:46,570 --> 01:35:48,130
That's not good.

1593
01:35:53,370 --> 01:35:54,290
It's fine.

1594
01:35:58,100 --> 01:35:59,340
Just need to keep getting damage.

1595
01:36:04,110 --> 01:36:04,990
Okay, nice.

1596
01:36:05,990 --> 01:36:07,050
Oh shit, sorry.

1597
01:36:08,090 --> 01:36:08,570
Nope.

1598
01:36:09,590 --> 01:36:10,430
People are just too good!

1599
01:36:10,510 --> 01:36:11,330
No one's getting damage!

1600
01:36:17,910 --> 01:36:18,390
Jesus.

1601
01:36:18,750 --> 01:36:18,910
Okay.

1602
01:36:21,050 --> 01:36:21,970
What's that all about?

1603
01:36:24,670 --> 01:36:25,950
Oh my god, is he okay?

1604
01:36:30,510 --> 01:36:30,990
Okay.

1605
01:36:30,990 --> 01:36:31,650
Okay.

1606
01:36:33,370 --> 01:36:34,450
It's fine.

1607
01:36:36,650 --> 01:36:39,310
There's too much stuff going on!

1608
01:36:40,890 --> 01:36:42,830
I'm gonna dance!

1609
01:36:59,720 --> 01:37:00,650
Oh, thank you.

1610
01:37:00,910 --> 01:37:01,990
I really appreciate that.

1611
01:37:02,990 --> 01:37:04,090
There we go.

1612
01:37:05,110 --> 01:37:05,870
Oh!

1613
01:37:06,930 --> 01:37:07,690
What?!

1614
01:37:07,690 --> 01:37:09,170
Oh my god!

1615
01:37:09,530 --> 01:37:11,570
I was on top!

1616
01:37:12,470 --> 01:37:13,310
Oh my god!

1617
01:37:13,910 --> 01:37:14,290
Oh!

1618
01:37:18,570 --> 01:37:19,330
What?!

1619
01:37:19,330 --> 01:37:19,690
What?!

1620
01:37:19,690 --> 01:37:21,050
Oh my god!

1621
01:37:21,410 --> 01:37:21,910
Oh my god!

1622
01:37:22,170 --> 01:37:23,230
Oh my god!

1623
01:37:25,670 --> 01:37:28,230
That was actually bullshit!

1624
01:37:29,210 --> 01:37:30,170
Oh my god!

1625
01:37:30,690 --> 01:37:31,190
Oh my god!

1626
01:37:31,190 --> 01:37:33,430
How did that land on me?!

1627
01:37:33,430 --> 01:37:35,550
I was in the fucking tower!

1628
01:37:36,550 --> 01:37:37,490
Oh my god!

1629
01:37:37,650 --> 01:37:41,260
That was fucking bullshit!

1630
01:37:41,940 --> 01:37:45,660
How the fuck was that?!

1631
01:37:45,660 --> 01:37:45,980
Oh

1632
01:37:49,170 --> 01:37:55,390
my god!

1633
01:37:55,670 --> 01:37:58,970
That's actually crazy that that hit me!

1634
01:37:59,150 --> 01:38:02,090
That should not have hit me at all!

1635
01:38:02,090 --> 01:38:02,370
Oh!

1636
01:38:03,870 --> 01:38:05,490
Oh my god!

1637
01:38:05,610 --> 01:38:06,850
That actually shouldn't have hit me!

1638
01:38:07,050 --> 01:38:07,970
I'm so mad!

1639
01:38:08,450 --> 01:38:10,590
I'm so mad!

1640
01:38:11,390 --> 01:38:14,070
That was actually bullshit!

1641
01:38:16,650 --> 01:38:18,310
I'm so mad!

1642
01:38:22,650 --> 01:38:24,570
Jesus Christ!

1643
01:38:34,480 --> 01:38:35,100
Building!

1644
01:38:45,320 --> 01:38:47,160
Oh my god!

1645
01:38:47,160 --> 01:38:49,040
Holy fuck!

1646
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:50,920
Like...

1647
01:38:50,920 --> 01:38:55,940
I just got pulled into the fucking vortex of war!

1648
01:38:56,520 --> 01:38:57,060
Like...

1649
01:38:57,060 --> 01:38:58,000
The vortex!

1650
01:38:58,320 --> 01:38:58,520
Yeah!

1651
01:38:58,940 --> 01:39:00,740
See what I did there?

1652
01:39:01,820 --> 01:39:03,320
The vortex!

1653
01:39:12,700 --> 01:39:13,660
That was crazy.

1654
01:39:14,380 --> 01:39:15,840
I did not expect that.

1655
01:39:20,200 --> 01:39:21,100
See guys?

1656
01:39:21,320 --> 01:39:22,640
I never have to heal him.

1657
01:39:23,180 --> 01:39:24,100
It's so nice.

1658
01:39:25,660 --> 01:39:27,540
He doesn't complain about heals.

1659
01:39:28,060 --> 01:39:30,120
And then I don't have to give a fuck about him.

1660
01:39:30,700 --> 01:39:31,360
Until like...

1661
01:39:31,360 --> 01:39:33,200
Until he gets died by 20 people.

1662
01:39:44,080 --> 01:39:44,920
That's the thing!

1663
01:39:44,920 --> 01:39:47,460
Why is the hitbox so high?

1664
01:39:48,260 --> 01:39:48,300
What?

1665
01:39:56,580 --> 01:39:56,980
Alright.

1666
01:40:00,940 --> 01:40:04,040
Of course it's me and Churn4!

1667
01:40:04,300 --> 01:40:06,900
Of course it's me and Churn4!

1668
01:40:07,220 --> 01:40:08,560
Us not paying attention!

1669
01:40:08,860 --> 01:40:11,260
We were both not paying attention!

1670
01:40:11,960 --> 01:40:13,140
Of fucking course!

1671
01:40:13,140 --> 01:40:15,580
We were both not paying attention!

1672
01:40:15,800 --> 01:40:17,080
Because we were fucking streaming!

1673
01:40:17,540 --> 01:40:20,120
I bet they said that there's mines and we didn't care!

1674
01:40:20,580 --> 01:40:22,740
I bet you like the chat was like...

1675
01:40:22,740 --> 01:40:27,240
Their team was telling us there were mines in the chat, but we didn't fucking care.

1676
01:40:27,680 --> 01:40:29,240
We were just like...

1677
01:40:34,400 --> 01:40:36,440
I can see that.

1678
01:40:36,880 --> 01:40:39,440
I can see us not fucking paying attention.

1679
01:40:40,520 --> 01:40:41,800
This is not fair.

1680
01:40:41,800 --> 01:40:44,400
This is a streamer diff right there.

1681
01:40:45,060 --> 01:40:47,540
Now they all know to play high ground.

1682
01:40:52,050 --> 01:40:54,330
You know about the high ground control now.

1683
01:40:59,060 --> 01:40:59,740
Nice.

1684
01:41:04,050 --> 01:41:06,310
Nice, where is...

1685
01:41:09,510 --> 01:41:10,190
Fine.

1686
01:41:11,210 --> 01:41:12,510
Nice, we did it.

1687
01:41:18,790 --> 01:41:19,470
Yeah.

1688
01:41:20,490 --> 01:41:23,170
This actual streamer debuff right there.

1689
01:41:23,650 --> 01:41:24,170
Of course.

1690
01:41:25,090 --> 01:41:27,610
Churn4 might have also been talking to his chat.

1691
01:41:27,850 --> 01:41:29,590
And then I was talking to my chat.

1692
01:41:29,990 --> 01:41:32,750
And then my team was like...

1693
01:41:32,750 --> 01:41:34,870
I had to penny the door.

1694
01:41:36,270 --> 01:41:38,290
I'm like, I don't give a fuck about Churn4.

1695
01:41:42,370 --> 01:41:43,410
Poor guy.

1696
01:41:45,190 --> 01:41:47,090
He's sorry for me.

1697
01:41:47,090 --> 01:41:49,050
He's not sorry for Churn4.

1698
01:41:49,270 --> 01:41:55,290
He's not sorry for him.

1699
01:42:11,250 --> 01:42:12,110
Alright.

1700
01:42:13,050 --> 01:42:14,230
The insta pick.

1701
01:42:14,230 --> 01:42:14,430
Oh my god.

1702
01:42:16,670 --> 01:42:19,390
I hope we don't have more Luna players.

1703
01:42:22,190 --> 01:42:24,930
My shit talk Jeff and then all I get is Jeff players.

1704
01:42:25,190 --> 01:42:25,850
I'm sorry.

1705
01:42:26,850 --> 01:42:28,230
He's not even meta.

1706
01:42:28,870 --> 01:42:30,230
He's not even...

1707
01:42:30,850 --> 01:42:31,550
Wait, what?

1708
01:42:31,970 --> 01:42:36,090
I was like, yeah, Jeff is not the most optimal for support right now.

1709
01:42:36,130 --> 01:42:38,970
And then I literally get all the Jeff players on my team.

1710
01:42:41,470 --> 01:42:43,310
Literally, he's not meta in high elo.

1711
01:42:46,390 --> 01:42:48,790
Yeah, but Mantis and Cloak and Dagger are just better.

1712
01:42:57,020 --> 01:42:58,680
Yeah, everybody stop.

1713
01:42:59,420 --> 01:43:00,380
Stop playing Luna.

1714
01:43:00,500 --> 01:43:01,420
She's actually trash.

1715
01:43:02,220 --> 01:43:04,280
But I make her look good, guys.

1716
01:43:06,780 --> 01:43:07,880
Stop playing Luna.

1717
01:43:08,020 --> 01:43:09,040
She's actually trash.

1718
01:43:09,120 --> 01:43:10,220
Except when I'm on Luna.

1719
01:43:10,700 --> 01:43:11,500
Then she's good.

1720
01:43:12,080 --> 01:43:14,740
If you see me in the lobby, don't play Luna.

1721
01:43:27,270 --> 01:43:33,150
But the Luna-Jeff team up though... I still think Mantis is better overall.

1722
01:43:34,270 --> 01:43:35,370
That's my opinion though.

1723
01:43:36,410 --> 01:43:40,950
I personally think she's just... I think like Mantis overall is just a better character.

1724
01:43:43,570 --> 01:43:45,510
Despite the team up.

1725
01:43:56,860 --> 01:44:09,200
I think like Mantis is all in Cloak's Mantis is all in Cloak's healing output is just overall better than Jeff.

1726
01:44:14,840 --> 01:44:16,800
That's why I want to learn Mantis.

1727
01:44:17,420 --> 01:44:21,120
Because I saw so many really good players playing Mantis.

1728
01:44:21,280 --> 01:44:22,500
So I really want to learn her.

1729
01:44:23,560 --> 01:44:24,800
I just wish I...

1730
01:44:25,520 --> 01:44:28,080
What the fuck is Captain America going to do anyway?

1731
01:44:31,120 --> 01:44:31,580
Okay.

1732
01:44:32,140 --> 01:44:32,420
Bye.

1733
01:44:32,500 --> 01:44:35,960
Goodbye, Captain America.

1734
01:44:36,140 --> 01:44:37,660
Oh, unless... Oh, shit.

1735
01:44:39,220 --> 01:44:39,680
Nevermind.

1736
01:44:40,460 --> 01:44:41,320
He also have a tree.

1737
01:44:41,400 --> 01:44:42,260
Wait, did he tree?

1738
01:44:42,520 --> 01:44:44,640
Wait, he treed Captain America!

1739
01:44:46,800 --> 01:44:47,360
That's fucked.

1740
01:44:47,760 --> 01:44:49,360
That's so fucked.

1741
01:44:49,860 --> 01:44:50,460
He like...

1742
01:44:50,460 --> 01:44:52,580
He killed this tank buddy.

1743
01:44:54,660 --> 01:44:56,120
Did we get... Did we kill anybody?

1744
01:45:00,020 --> 01:45:00,780
No!

1745
01:45:04,150 --> 01:45:05,150
That's fine.

1746
01:45:05,230 --> 01:45:05,650
We're fine.

1747
01:45:07,570 --> 01:45:08,890
We're still healthy.

1748
01:45:12,400 --> 01:45:13,160
Easy.

1749
01:45:13,460 --> 01:45:15,180
Shark on shark violence.

1750
01:45:16,140 --> 01:45:16,900
No!

1751
01:45:17,140 --> 01:45:17,600
Jeff!

1752
01:45:20,780 --> 01:45:21,260
Okay.

1753
01:45:22,140 --> 01:45:22,960
We're okay.

1754
01:45:25,260 --> 01:45:26,840
Yeah, I see Captain America.

1755
01:45:27,360 --> 01:45:29,540
I barely ever see anyone play Captain America.

1756
01:45:29,740 --> 01:45:30,540
He's just not that good.

1757
01:45:32,540 --> 01:45:33,880
Like, what is he tanking?

1758
01:45:34,240 --> 01:45:35,400
Who is he tanking for?

1759
01:45:38,100 --> 01:45:38,800
Oh, no.

1760
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:39,720
Oh, no.

1761
01:45:40,060 --> 01:45:40,820
Oh, no.

1762
01:45:41,420 --> 01:45:42,180
Who is he gonna eat?

1763
01:45:42,260 --> 01:45:42,840
Oh, no!

1764
01:45:43,360 --> 01:45:43,720
No!

1765
01:45:44,460 --> 01:45:45,300
I'm sorry!

1766
01:45:45,500 --> 01:45:47,040
I can't do anything about it!

1767
01:45:47,040 --> 01:45:48,100
Oh!

1768
01:45:48,600 --> 01:45:49,420
I killed him, though!

1769
01:45:49,800 --> 01:45:51,080
Okay, we're not winning.

1770
01:45:52,040 --> 01:45:52,600
Yeah!

1771
01:45:54,220 --> 01:45:55,060
It's okay!

1772
01:45:55,420 --> 01:45:57,120
I did it for you guys!

1773
01:45:59,220 --> 01:46:01,260
He is tanking for America.

1774
01:46:04,040 --> 01:46:05,240
Wait, who's again?

1775
01:46:06,480 --> 01:46:08,260
Okay, we can ult with my ult.

1776
01:46:09,520 --> 01:46:12,300
We can use it to engage like a Lucio beat.

1777
01:46:17,950 --> 01:46:19,330
Alright, let's go!

1778
01:46:19,970 --> 01:46:21,350
Let's go, guys!

1779
01:46:22,250 --> 01:46:22,530
Woo!

1780
01:46:26,570 --> 01:46:28,350
Let's fucking dance!

1781
01:46:29,210 --> 01:46:29,870
Let's go!

1782
01:46:31,130 --> 01:46:32,490
Keep dancing!

1783
01:46:33,510 --> 01:46:34,230
Oh my god!

1784
01:46:34,310 --> 01:46:36,810
I'm literally ulting for Q!

1785
01:46:38,150 --> 01:46:40,150
Oh my god, that's so fucked.

1786
01:46:40,490 --> 01:46:42,330
He solo ulted him!

1787
01:46:43,410 --> 01:46:45,110
That's so fucked!

1788
01:46:45,530 --> 01:46:49,830
Like, they were not gonna win that fight and he solo ulted him.

1789
01:46:50,110 --> 01:46:51,470
That's actually crazy.

1790
01:46:52,750 --> 01:46:54,250
That's like...

1791
01:46:54,250 --> 01:46:56,650
That's so toxic.

1792
01:47:01,930 --> 01:47:03,730
That's so fucking toxic.

1793
01:47:04,130 --> 01:47:07,390
Like, they obviously lost the round and he still ulted.

1794
01:47:09,990 --> 01:47:12,430
That was actually disgusting.

1795
01:47:17,050 --> 01:47:18,050
Oh my god.

1796
01:47:18,430 --> 01:47:21,710
When I'm in Atlanta, I'm gonna fucking see a doctor.

1797
01:47:21,990 --> 01:47:27,490
I'm gonna fucking see a doctor in Atlanta, guys.

1798
01:47:30,830 --> 01:47:31,070
Woo!

1799
01:47:33,050 --> 01:47:33,430
Woo!

1800
01:47:34,710 --> 01:47:36,910
I need antibiotics, man.

1801
01:47:37,690 --> 01:47:38,110
Alright.

1802
01:47:39,070 --> 01:47:41,150
I really need antibiotics.

1803
01:47:42,170 --> 01:47:44,650
I haven't been able to see a doctor in Canada.

1804
01:47:44,650 --> 01:47:45,190
Hahaha.

1805
01:47:47,850 --> 01:47:49,150
I'm okay with paying for it.

1806
01:47:49,190 --> 01:47:49,950
I got sponsors.

1807
01:47:50,530 --> 01:47:52,270
I have a sponsor stream when I get back.

1808
01:47:52,330 --> 01:47:53,190
I'll use that.

1809
01:47:53,370 --> 01:47:53,830
Hahaha.

1810
01:47:54,590 --> 01:47:57,530
I have a sponsor stream when I get back anyway.

1811
01:47:57,790 --> 01:47:58,610
It's fine.

1812
01:47:58,770 --> 01:48:01,150
I'll use that to pay off my medical bills.

1813
01:48:06,820 --> 01:48:07,160
Okay.

1814
01:48:10,580 --> 01:48:11,460
Jesus Christ.

1815
01:48:11,620 --> 01:48:13,100
Oh my god!

1816
01:48:13,820 --> 01:48:14,340
Fucking...

1817
01:48:14,340 --> 01:48:16,320
Stop taking damage!

1818
01:48:19,880 --> 01:48:21,200
Jesus Christ.

1819
01:48:21,280 --> 01:48:22,420
I'm gonna capture the point.

1820
01:48:23,060 --> 01:48:24,720
I hope you guys get Jeffy's.

1821
01:48:29,290 --> 01:48:30,710
This is why I like shift.

1822
01:48:30,950 --> 01:48:31,830
Like, some people...

1823
01:48:32,590 --> 01:48:34,910
I don't... I plan my shifts very well.

1824
01:48:34,990 --> 01:48:42,810
Like, I try... I try to plan my shifts well to the point where, like, if they're all, like, together and there's a team fight, I usually use my shift.

1825
01:48:43,150 --> 01:48:46,490
And if I feel like it's gonna be a... Wait, what?

1826
01:48:47,530 --> 01:48:48,950
Why is there a Dr. Strange in here?

1827
01:48:49,470 --> 01:48:50,590
Oh, shit!

1828
01:48:52,350 --> 01:48:55,410
And I try to make... use it as, like, a...

1829
01:48:56,130 --> 01:49:05,370
either a defensive shift or, like, or if I need to... if I know, like, there's gonna be a lot of... a lot of damage together.

1830
01:49:08,450 --> 01:49:09,110
I don't know.

1831
01:49:09,230 --> 01:49:09,930
Just in case.

1832
01:49:10,770 --> 01:49:11,950
Oh my god!

1833
01:49:11,950 --> 01:49:12,670
I'm dead!

1834
01:49:15,680 --> 01:49:16,560
I'm dead!

1835
01:49:33,570 --> 01:49:34,970
What the fuck?

1836
01:49:35,170 --> 01:49:35,870
Oh, goodbye.

1837
01:49:36,630 --> 01:49:37,430
You know what?

1838
01:49:37,530 --> 01:49:38,450
I think we can do it.

1839
01:49:38,590 --> 01:49:40,870
Guys, I think... Let's go.

1840
01:49:41,390 --> 01:49:42,290
Let's fight here.

1841
01:49:42,690 --> 01:49:44,110
Guys, I think we can do it.

1842
01:49:44,350 --> 01:49:46,030
I think I can live.

1843
01:49:46,610 --> 01:49:50,890
I think... I think I can stall for, like...

1844
01:49:51,670 --> 01:49:54,850
Okay, now that's a little bit scary, though.

1845
01:49:55,170 --> 01:49:58,530
That would... Yeah, I don't... Guys, I think I don't think we can... I don't think we can live anymore.

1846
01:49:58,990 --> 01:50:01,150
I don't... I don't think...

1847
01:50:01,150 --> 01:50:03,990
I, like, I danced on the point alone.

1848
01:50:04,430 --> 01:50:06,190
Where was my teammate in that?

1849
01:50:06,730 --> 01:50:09,110
We're having a little dance battle.

1850
01:50:13,540 --> 01:50:14,060
Okay.

1851
01:50:16,220 --> 01:50:18,560
Alright, now I don't have to care about you.

1852
01:50:20,760 --> 01:50:23,140
So I can heal my team now and then you'll be healed.

1853
01:50:23,760 --> 01:50:25,160
What the fuck?!

1854
01:50:25,160 --> 01:50:26,140
That's so fucked up!

1855
01:50:31,800 --> 01:50:33,640
That's so fucked up!

1856
01:50:36,620 --> 01:50:38,380
That's so fucked up.

1857
01:50:43,260 --> 01:50:44,780
That's so...

1858
01:50:44,780 --> 01:50:47,510
That's actually so fucked up.

1859
01:50:48,920 --> 01:50:53,900
That was a solo Oh my god.

1860
01:50:54,700 --> 01:50:56,920
That's toxic as fuck.

1861
01:51:00,610 --> 01:51:03,180
I saw that happen and I walked away.

1862
01:51:04,320 --> 01:51:05,600
You just...

1863
01:51:05,600 --> 01:51:07,080
Doki, you just walked away.

1864
01:51:07,260 --> 01:51:07,760
Doki.

1865
01:51:08,420 --> 01:51:09,840
What was I supposed to do?

1866
01:51:10,880 --> 01:51:12,520
Of course I walked away.

1867
01:51:12,620 --> 01:51:14,400
That shit was scary as fuck.

1868
01:51:17,580 --> 01:51:19,900
It was nothing for me to do.

1869
01:51:20,420 --> 01:51:22,740
I had to just walk away.

1870
01:51:27,940 --> 01:51:28,580
Okay.

1871
01:51:29,660 --> 01:51:30,240
Nice.

1872
01:51:30,240 --> 01:51:30,280
Nice.

1873
01:51:34,260 --> 01:51:34,920
Yay!

1874
01:51:35,460 --> 01:51:37,340
Not my problem.

1875
01:51:44,680 --> 01:51:47,180
Bro, he got solo ulted two times.

1876
01:51:49,020 --> 01:51:51,300
That's why I also like playing with Surefour.

1877
01:51:51,900 --> 01:51:54,680
Because everybody targets him instead of me.

1878
01:51:55,140 --> 01:52:06,560
Because usually you target the support but then because he's there, people know who he is as a streamer so everybody just targets him instead of me so I get to roam free.

1879
01:52:07,140 --> 01:52:08,040
Like, I get to...

1880
01:52:09,440 --> 01:52:11,900
I get to be free.

1881
01:52:15,320 --> 01:52:17,020
What did it do to make them that mad?

1882
01:52:17,160 --> 01:52:20,760
Because he's a streamer and they're like haha, time to kill the streamer.

1883
01:52:24,900 --> 01:52:26,160
You guys don't know that!

1884
01:52:30,480 --> 01:52:30,880
Yay!

1885
01:52:32,420 --> 01:52:33,140
Let's go!

1886
01:52:33,140 --> 01:52:34,740
Let's go!

1887
01:52:35,720 --> 01:52:36,080
Yeah!

1888
01:52:37,200 --> 01:52:38,540
Luna snow!

1889
01:52:41,800 --> 01:52:44,960
Yeah, I am a streamer but I'm on YouTube.

1890
01:52:45,380 --> 01:52:46,480
They don't know who I am.

1891
01:52:46,820 --> 01:52:49,060
That's basically it.

1892
01:52:49,560 --> 01:52:53,640
I have the YouTube diff.

1893
01:52:58,200 --> 01:52:59,940
So I don't get targeted.

1894
01:52:59,940 --> 01:53:00,080
That's basically it.

1895
01:53:02,540 --> 01:53:16,580
I've actually been thinking about doing Twitch streams occasionally but that's going to be the new year because my manager is telling me how because a lot of not just YouTuber viewers but regular viewers Hey Doki!

1896
01:53:17,120 --> 01:53:18,700
I'm getting recognized so much.

1897
01:53:21,620 --> 01:53:48,340
Because my manager is telling me that I should try to stream on Twitch more and just to grow my audience in NA for people like the non-VTuber watchers or people who don't normally watch VTubers on YouTube and he was telling me that maybe I should do something like occasionally where I just stream whatever the fuck I want but like an actual Twitch streamer but it will be like occasionally and stuff.

1898
01:53:48,880 --> 01:53:57,980
It won't be like something I do, like try to do regularly No, not regularly but more so like maybe like once every two weeks where I just stream whatever the fuck I want.

1899
01:53:58,100 --> 01:54:00,040
Or maybe once a week on Twitch.

1900
01:54:00,240 --> 01:54:01,940
Like there won't be a set anything set.

1901
01:54:02,280 --> 01:54:24,060
Just be like OH SHIT I WAS NOT PAYING ATTENTION I don't like multi-streaming I don't like multi-streaming and stuff Because I don't like splitting the audience in general Okay, now I got focused I was trolling.

1902
01:54:24,220 --> 01:54:28,200
Whoops My bad I was trolling.

1903
01:54:28,300 --> 01:54:43,240
I'm sorry I was having a conversation not related to my video game match My bad I'm sorry I won't do that again

1904
01:54:48,490 --> 01:54:54,630
Okay, I'm locking in But YouTube will always be my main platform.

1905
01:54:55,290 --> 01:54:57,070
But that's something I'm thinking about in 2025

1906
01:55:00,170 --> 01:55:05,930
But I'll talk more about like how I see, envision it Who's that?

1907
01:55:06,270 --> 01:55:10,830
Oh, it's the cloak and dagger Is he gonna be okay?

1908
01:55:11,410 --> 01:55:11,830
I see

1909
01:55:15,670 --> 01:55:16,510
Jesus Christ.

1910

I think we just need like...

1946
01:59:30,850 --> 01:59:32,730
Alright, one of our DPS is lacking.

1947
01:59:36,090 --> 01:59:40,610
The fact that the person that's playing Storm is making it work is a little concerning.

1948
01:59:44,010 --> 01:59:51,770
It's very concerning that Storm is working for him.

1949
01:59:54,190 --> 01:59:58,550
And you know I am doing so much to keep you alive.

1950
02:00:01,350 --> 02:00:02,970
Don't worry!

1951
02:00:04,450 --> 02:00:08,830
Don't worry, she can't tornado us anymore!

1952
02:00:10,610 --> 02:00:12,350
She can't hurt us anymore!

1953
02:00:14,950 --> 02:00:16,050
Oh my god.

1954
02:00:18,190 --> 02:00:18,710
Please.

1955
02:00:19,670 --> 02:00:20,650
She can't hurt us.

1956
02:00:24,870 --> 02:00:27,630
She can't, oh, she might be able, she might hurt us.

1957
02:00:28,110 --> 02:00:29,290
She, she might hurt us.

1958
02:00:29,770 --> 02:00:30,650
She might hurt, oh.

1959
02:00:32,650 --> 02:00:35,550
Okay, okay, she definitely hurt us.

1960
02:00:40,590 --> 02:00:41,750
I have no idea.

1961
02:00:45,310 --> 02:00:45,870
Oh.

1962
02:00:46,290 --> 02:00:46,730
Oh, yeah.

1963
02:00:47,370 --> 02:00:49,170
The bad woman.

1964
02:00:49,650 --> 02:00:51,850
Yeah, the board again, all is so strong.

1965
02:00:52,450 --> 02:00:53,750
That's why I want to learn Adam too.

1966
02:00:53,910 --> 02:00:58,470
Cause her, his res is really good, but I just, his heal output is so scary.

1967
02:01:01,310 --> 02:01:09,490
I feel like, um, I feel like, um, Adam's heal output is so like scary because it's like very limited.

1968
02:01:12,270 --> 02:01:14,850
You literally play Adam for the res.

1969
02:01:19,990 --> 02:01:22,890
But like, he doesn't heal that much IMO.

1970
02:01:23,950 --> 02:01:27,930
So like, you gotta be really scared about what to do.

1971
02:01:28,890 --> 02:01:29,210
Okay.

1972
02:01:32,530 --> 02:01:34,810
Oh hey, we got two tanks, let's go!

1973
02:01:35,310 --> 02:01:38,810
Oh my god, woah, we got three tanks, let's fucking go!

1974
02:01:41,250 --> 02:01:45,090
Now, now we just don't need DPS I guess.

1975
02:01:45,630 --> 02:01:50,350
You know what, let's fuck it, let's go, let's just be, let's bring back Ghost.

1976
02:01:50,410 --> 02:01:53,170
Let's play, let's play three supports too, let's fucking go.

1977
02:01:57,680 --> 02:01:58,880
Yeah, why the fuck not?

1978
02:01:59,280 --> 02:02:00,100
That's great.

1979
02:02:00,380 --> 02:02:02,440
We'll just put this on him and he'll never die.

1980
02:02:07,720 --> 02:02:10,820
As long as we heal the support, he'll never fucking die, right?

1981
02:02:11,120 --> 02:02:12,520
Technically that's how it goes.

1982
02:02:14,560 --> 02:02:18,680
He's like, Luna is like, is like basically Lucio-Zen.

1983
02:02:19,140 --> 02:02:20,660
A sexy Lucio-Zen.

1984
02:02:21,920 --> 02:02:24,500
Like, but Zen's already sexy.

1985
02:02:25,840 --> 02:02:26,860
True, true.

1986
02:02:27,340 --> 02:02:31,300
They're like a sexy non, non-robot.

1987
02:02:34,910 --> 02:02:38,050
Okay, oh wait, he swapped off tank, okay.

1988
02:02:41,670 --> 02:02:41,910
Oh.

1989
02:02:42,950 --> 02:02:46,880
I, I heard her too late!

1990
02:02:48,240 --> 02:02:51,120
I heard her too and I tried to drop down!

1991
02:02:51,380 --> 02:02:54,060
Oh my god, I should've dropped earlier.

1992
02:02:54,400 --> 02:02:55,400
That was my bad.

1993
02:02:56,900 --> 02:02:59,780
I mean like the moment I hear that I shouldn't even challenge her.

1994
02:03:00,400 --> 02:03:01,600
I should've just dropped down.

1995
02:03:02,600 --> 02:03:04,520
That sucks, that happened.

1996
02:03:05,440 --> 02:03:06,360
But it's fine.

1997
02:03:07,820 --> 02:03:09,440
I can, we can contest this.

1998
02:03:12,220 --> 02:03:14,920
It's fine, I got, I got the clap!

1999
02:03:15,700 --> 02:03:17,000
I got the power of clap!

2000
02:03:23,570 --> 02:03:24,010
Nice.

2001
02:03:24,870 --> 02:03:26,650
Clap, clap, clap, clap, clap.

2002
02:03:27,950 --> 02:03:29,430
Here we go, push up.

2003
02:03:31,570 --> 02:03:32,790
I have ult soon too.

2004
02:03:33,110 --> 02:03:34,530
I'm not gonna do high ground.

2005
02:03:35,130 --> 02:03:36,250
It's way too risky.

2006
02:03:37,150 --> 02:03:38,370
I'm scared of getting flanked.

2007
02:03:39,350 --> 02:03:41,250
I'm so scared of getting flanked.

2008
02:03:42,290 --> 02:03:44,090
I'm just gonna, I'm gonna play backline.

2009
02:03:48,430 --> 02:03:51,150
I'll play backline close to my other team.

2010
02:03:53,650 --> 02:03:55,490
Cause I, I can hear her.

2011
02:03:56,030 --> 02:03:57,510
I hear her footsteps, yeah.

2012
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:05,860
C'mon, keep healing, keep healing each other.

2013
02:04:06,180 --> 02:04:08,580
We're friends, we're gonna be friends.

2014
02:04:09,520 --> 02:04:11,700
You can't do anything about this.

2015
02:04:11,960 --> 02:04:14,100
Woah, that's right.

2016
02:04:15,060 --> 02:04:16,260
That's right.

2017
02:04:17,320 --> 02:04:18,520
I'm dancing!

2018
02:04:25,730 --> 02:04:26,770
I might live this.

2019
02:04:30,880 --> 02:04:31,840
Here we go.

2020
02:04:33,760 --> 02:04:34,360
Nice.

2021
02:04:35,800 --> 02:04:39,200
That was, that was a good dance off right there.

2022
02:04:40,060 --> 02:04:42,680
That was a really good dance off right there.

2023
02:04:43,180 --> 02:04:45,600
Okay, one minute, that's two fights left.

2024
02:04:45,600 --> 02:04:47,160
They used a lot too.

2025
02:04:47,240 --> 02:04:53,380
I think they used, uh, they set up Black Panther ult and Storm ult, which is scary because we had no defensive ult for that.

2026
02:04:55,680 --> 02:05:00,620
We had no defensive ult for, uh, Black Panther and Storm.

2027
02:05:03,260 --> 02:05:05,700
So, we'll hope everything will be okay.

2028
02:05:10,120 --> 02:05:10,640
Nice.

2029
02:05:11,560 --> 02:05:12,260
We got two kills.

2030
02:05:15,500 --> 02:05:16,020
Woah.

2031
02:05:17,960 --> 02:05:19,620
Sometimes I have to, like, three.

2032
02:05:20,040 --> 02:05:21,520
I have to, like, 180.

2033
02:05:25,780 --> 02:05:26,880
Oh my god, there he is!

2034
02:05:28,380 --> 02:05:29,320
Please, he's one!

2035
02:05:29,780 --> 02:05:30,440
Okay, nice.

2036
02:05:31,320 --> 02:05:31,660
Nice.

2037
02:05:34,620 --> 02:05:36,060
I have to be like...

2038
02:05:36,060 --> 02:05:39,420
When I see Black Panther, it's just...

2039
02:05:41,960 --> 02:05:42,440
Alright.

2040
02:05:43,380 --> 02:05:43,820
Bye-bye.

2041
02:05:44,980 --> 02:05:45,460
360?

2042
02:05:45,460 --> 02:05:48,140
No, he has no scope yet.

2043
02:05:48,420 --> 02:05:49,100
Oh, no!

2044
02:05:50,320 --> 02:05:51,260
Oh, no!

2045
02:05:52,340 --> 02:05:53,240
Oh, no!

2046
02:05:54,680 --> 02:05:55,340
No!

2047
02:05:57,760 --> 02:05:58,200
Dang!

2048
02:05:58,660 --> 02:05:59,820
Oh my god!

2049
02:06:00,400 --> 02:06:02,840
That's what I'm saying, there's no defensive ult!

2050
02:06:05,220 --> 02:06:05,720
Oh, no.

2051
02:06:05,960 --> 02:06:06,160
Okay.

2052
02:06:06,820 --> 02:06:07,840
I'm fucking...

2053
02:06:07,840 --> 02:06:08,980
I'm coming over.

2054
02:06:09,140 --> 02:06:09,340
No!

2055
02:06:09,460 --> 02:06:11,740
And then he brought the Mercy Rez them all!

2056
02:06:12,580 --> 02:06:13,100
Yeah.

2057
02:06:14,940 --> 02:06:16,200
Oh my god.

2058
02:06:16,280 --> 02:06:17,240
This is why I don't...

2059
02:06:17,240 --> 02:06:18,520
Like, Jeff is, like, hard.

2060
02:06:18,980 --> 02:06:20,700
Like, it's such off-meta.

2061
02:06:21,660 --> 02:06:22,540
He is...

2062
02:06:22,540 --> 02:06:24,580
Like, they have so many...

2063
02:06:24,580 --> 02:06:26,000
I can't use...

2064
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:27,240
I just got my...

2065
02:06:29,520 --> 02:06:31,720
To be fair, if I...

2066
02:06:32,520 --> 02:06:33,460
You guys see that?

2067
02:06:33,540 --> 02:06:34,380
That was pretty cool, though.

2068
02:06:35,460 --> 02:06:37,240
If I live, that would be pretty cool.

2069
02:06:37,460 --> 02:06:40,180
If I live, that would be pretty cool if I live!

2070
02:06:40,520 --> 02:06:41,500
Okay, I live.

2071
02:06:41,680 --> 02:06:42,440
But we lost group.

2072
02:06:43,660 --> 02:06:44,540
We lost...

2073
02:06:44,540 --> 02:06:45,640
Oh my god!

2074
02:06:45,640 --> 02:06:47,800
We lost them!

2075
02:06:48,060 --> 02:06:49,080
I couldn't...

2076
02:06:50,930 --> 02:06:51,830
Oh, the Panther!

2077
02:06:55,780 --> 02:06:56,620
I had...

2078
02:06:56,620 --> 02:06:57,160
Oh my god.

2079
02:06:57,240 --> 02:06:57,520
If I...

2080
02:06:57,520 --> 02:06:59,300
I should've just ulted when I got dove.

2081
02:07:03,380 --> 02:07:04,500
Oh, that sucked.

2082
02:07:06,080 --> 02:07:07,180
Oh my god, there we go.

2083
02:07:07,200 --> 02:07:08,120
We have to fight this.

2084
02:07:08,500 --> 02:07:09,900
We have to fight this, guys.

2085
02:07:12,860 --> 02:07:13,300
Please.

2086
02:07:14,480 --> 02:07:15,620
Oh my god, please.

2087
02:07:16,500 --> 02:07:18,020
We have to fight this.

2088
02:07:18,740 --> 02:07:19,180
Nice.

2089
02:07:20,050 --> 02:07:21,100
I had to ult there.

2090
02:07:21,280 --> 02:07:23,020
It's literally the only way to win that fight.

2091
02:07:30,540 --> 02:07:31,380
Oh no.

2092
02:07:34,530 --> 02:07:35,110
Please.

2093
02:07:35,710 --> 02:07:36,370
Oh my god.

2094
02:07:37,270 --> 02:07:38,850
I'm solo healing everything.

2095
02:07:40,570 --> 02:07:41,150
No!

2096
02:07:41,510 --> 02:07:41,790
Oh!

2097
02:07:42,570 --> 02:07:44,430
I lived, but like for how long?

2098
02:07:45,130 --> 02:07:45,770
Oh, thank god.

2099
02:07:51,200 --> 02:07:54,560
Oh my god, I'm actually carrying this!

2100
02:07:55,240 --> 02:07:55,760
No!

2101
02:07:55,760 --> 02:07:56,520
No!

2102
02:07:58,800 --> 02:08:00,040
Not Storm!

2103
02:08:05,480 --> 02:08:06,400
Please just live.

2104
02:08:06,920 --> 02:08:08,900
No, I literally just got my ult.

2105
02:08:08,940 --> 02:08:10,760
I literally just got my ult too.

2106
02:08:13,180 --> 02:08:13,800
Please.

2107
02:08:17,020 --> 02:08:18,620
Oh my god, I'm sorry.

2108
02:08:19,400 --> 02:08:23,200
I couldn't help!

2109
02:08:23,740 --> 02:08:25,060
Oh my god!

2110
02:08:25,980 --> 02:08:26,360
Oh!

2111
02:08:28,500 --> 02:08:29,120
No!

2112
02:08:29,120 --> 02:08:31,920
The shark doesn't count as a person!

2113
02:08:35,620 --> 02:08:37,900
Oh my god.

2114
02:08:38,890 --> 02:08:41,920
Oh my god, I played so well.

2115
02:08:42,720 --> 02:08:45,820
I actually played so well!

2116
02:08:47,860 --> 02:08:49,900
Oh my god.

2117
02:08:53,950 --> 02:08:56,300
I did so well there too.

2118
02:08:59,140 --> 02:08:59,820
Hmm.

2119
02:09:02,940 --> 02:09:05,140
Like, he's really good at Jeff.

2120
02:09:05,620 --> 02:09:09,960
It's just that we needed two defensive ults because they had so many...

2121
02:09:09,960 --> 02:09:13,660
They had way too many aggressive ults against us.

2122
02:09:13,780 --> 02:09:15,820
So we needed to...

2123
02:09:15,820 --> 02:09:19,840
We really needed an ult to defend ourselves with.

2124
02:09:21,060 --> 02:09:21,740
Yeah.

2125
02:09:23,040 --> 02:09:25,140
Like, his ult did nothing for us.

2126
02:09:25,200 --> 02:09:26,440
Yeah, not enough defensive ult.

2127
02:09:26,980 --> 02:09:29,500
Like, I can only do so much with a Luna ult.

2128
02:09:29,740 --> 02:09:32,640
I can only, like, I can defend against Dr. Strange ult.

2129
02:09:32,920 --> 02:09:36,680
I have to pick between Dr. Strange, Storm, or...

2130
02:09:36,680 --> 02:09:38,880
Dr. Strange or Storm or Hella.

2131
02:09:39,200 --> 02:09:42,260
And I can only use, like, one of the three.

2132
02:09:44,940 --> 02:09:46,440
So we needed, like, Adam.

2133
02:09:46,500 --> 02:09:48,160
Yeah, we needed Adam or Mantis.

2134
02:09:50,740 --> 02:09:52,600
That was a very intense game though.

2135
02:09:52,740 --> 02:09:53,980
That game was fucking crazy.

2136
02:09:54,400 --> 02:09:55,320
That was a good one.

2137
02:09:55,320 --> 02:09:56,520
That was a good game, IMO.

2138
02:10:00,530 --> 02:10:04,010
The person who played Storm actually made Storm look like a good character.

2139
02:10:08,470 --> 02:10:11,190
They made him look like an actual good character.

2140
02:10:16,730 --> 02:10:17,670
Hella can still... Not!

2141
02:10:18,390 --> 02:10:22,310
Luna heals can outheal the Hella.

2142
02:10:23,230 --> 02:10:23,970
I think.

2143
02:10:24,150 --> 02:10:25,150
I have tried it.

2144
02:10:25,330 --> 02:10:26,410
I feel like...

2145
02:10:26,410 --> 02:10:29,350
I feel like I can outheal Hella.

2146
02:10:29,790 --> 02:10:31,350
I just need, like...

2147
02:10:32,550 --> 02:10:33,310
Oh shit, nice.

2148
02:10:33,430 --> 02:10:34,910
I have... What was this team up again?

2149
02:10:35,030 --> 02:10:36,230
I don't remember this team up.

2150
02:10:37,430 --> 02:10:41,350
Oh, he gets my team up, right?

2151
02:10:44,510 --> 02:10:46,970
I have his channels into transferring her.

2152
02:10:48,950 --> 02:10:49,850
Yeah, what does this do?

2153
02:10:52,730 --> 02:10:54,230
Oh, it launches people.

2154
02:10:54,390 --> 02:10:55,530
Okay, I can heal with this.

2155
02:10:55,590 --> 02:10:55,830
Okay.

2156
02:10:56,650 --> 02:10:57,670
Alright, I get to heal.

2157
02:10:59,510 --> 02:11:00,010
Okay.

2158
02:11:01,730 --> 02:11:05,990
This also heals, and I can, like... I can challenge people with it.

2159
02:11:06,690 --> 02:11:08,610
Like, if I get hit by flankers.

2160
02:11:15,010 --> 02:11:19,990
Can it be the Wazler and the thingy with the super cat thingy thingy?

2161
02:11:21,250 --> 02:11:22,530
Oh, we have three supports.

2162
02:11:22,850 --> 02:11:23,970
Okay, three supports works.

2163
02:11:24,970 --> 02:11:27,410
As long as the other support goes DPS-ish.

2164
02:11:27,570 --> 02:11:28,330
Like, plays DPS.

2165
02:11:30,190 --> 02:11:31,270
Cause it can work.

2166
02:11:33,050 --> 02:11:35,350
Oh, we lost one of the supports, so...

2167
02:11:36,990 --> 02:11:41,630
We lost two of this.

2168
02:11:42,150 --> 02:11:42,470
Okay.

2169
02:11:46,830 --> 02:11:48,110
Oh, goodbye.

2170
02:11:49,090 --> 02:11:49,850
Guess we leave.

2171
02:11:53,930 --> 02:11:55,630
Guess we leave.

2172
02:11:55,630 --> 02:11:57,170
It can work.

2173
02:11:57,270 --> 02:12:01,870
I just was not expecting us to go three supports.

2174
02:12:05,110 --> 02:12:06,690
I legitimately think there's more...

2175
02:12:08,030 --> 02:12:12,630
It's surprising, cause you would think there's more DPS players than...

2176
02:12:13,330 --> 02:12:16,090
I honestly would prefer three DPS over three supports.

2177
02:12:16,510 --> 02:12:18,410
Cause if we want three supports, we need another team.

2178
02:12:22,100 --> 02:12:25,100
Cause I can't do enough healing for the, uh...

2179
02:12:29,000 --> 02:12:30,120
For the...

2180
02:12:30,120 --> 02:12:31,840
For the little... For the Zen orb shit.

2181
02:12:33,600 --> 02:12:34,880
Oh my god, let's go.

2182
02:12:35,360 --> 02:12:35,860
It's time.

2183
02:12:36,700 --> 02:12:37,980
It's time for the clap.

2184
02:12:41,600 --> 02:12:42,580
Oh my god.

2185
02:12:42,700 --> 02:12:42,980
Woo!

2186
02:12:47,620 --> 02:12:49,100
Oh, we're running...

2187
02:12:49,820 --> 02:12:51,220
We're running two supports now.

2188
02:12:51,300 --> 02:12:51,500
Okay.

2189
02:12:51,880 --> 02:12:52,340
That's good.

2190
02:12:55,280 --> 02:12:56,220
Okay, nice.

2191
02:12:57,100 --> 02:12:58,040
Alright, I'm focused now.

2192
02:12:58,900 --> 02:13:02,580
Alright, we lost two players already before the match started, but that's okay.

2193
02:13:03,860 --> 02:13:04,780
That's okay.

2194
02:13:05,740 --> 02:13:07,240
I'm just gonna hide here.

2195
02:13:07,420 --> 02:13:07,660
Oh.

2196
02:13:12,050 --> 02:13:13,030
We're fine.

2197
02:13:13,290 --> 02:13:14,830
I'm locked in.

2198
02:13:18,350 --> 02:13:18,590
What?

2199
02:13:21,190 --> 02:13:21,510
Oh!

2200
02:13:24,600 --> 02:13:26,760
I was like, what the fuck was that shit?

2201
02:13:28,560 --> 02:13:28,640
Fuck!

2202
02:13:29,240 --> 02:13:30,300
Oh my god!

2203
02:13:30,820 --> 02:13:32,160
I was like...

2204
02:13:32,160 --> 02:13:32,320
Huh?

2205
02:13:32,980 --> 02:13:33,200
What?

2206
02:13:34,040 --> 02:13:37,690
I just...

2207
02:13:38,030 --> 02:13:39,230
Oh my god!

2208
02:13:43,110 --> 02:13:44,330
I just...

2209
02:13:44,330 --> 02:13:45,590
And it gets me!

2210
02:13:45,690 --> 02:13:46,790
Of course it gets me.

2211
02:13:46,870 --> 02:13:48,290
Like, fuck me I guess.

2212
02:13:50,170 --> 02:13:52,730
Just a little bit.

2213
02:13:53,170 --> 02:13:54,070
Why me?

2214
02:13:55,250 --> 02:13:57,270
What did I do?

2215
02:13:59,650 --> 02:14:01,310
That's so fucked.

2216
02:14:02,350 --> 02:14:04,010
That's actually so fucked.

2217
02:14:07,860 --> 02:14:09,180
I'm so fucked.

2218
02:14:09,320 --> 02:14:11,000
There was nothing I could do.

2219
02:14:23,990 --> 02:14:24,710
That's right!

2220
02:14:24,910 --> 02:14:25,490
Beat him up!

2221
02:14:26,770 --> 02:14:27,650
Beat up the shark!

2222
02:14:31,740 --> 02:14:33,620
Jeff knows your sin.

2223
02:14:37,750 --> 02:14:39,170
I need to give him the orb.

2224
02:14:40,470 --> 02:14:41,070
That's good.

2225
02:14:41,110 --> 02:14:41,890
He beat up the shark.

2226
02:14:44,290 --> 02:14:44,970
For real.

2227
02:14:44,970 --> 02:14:46,030
There we go.

2228
02:14:47,730 --> 02:14:51,450
The only hard part about healing Trifor right now is because we have one tank.

2229
02:14:54,210 --> 02:14:56,630
So I need to figure out how to get him healed.

2230
02:14:57,250 --> 02:14:57,850
Alright.

2231
02:14:58,610 --> 02:14:59,310
This is it.

2232
02:14:59,750 --> 02:15:01,330
We're ready to put on a show now.

2233
02:15:04,650 --> 02:15:05,730
I'm dancing!

2234
02:15:07,250 --> 02:15:08,430
I'm dancing!

2235
02:15:09,550 --> 02:15:10,790
I'm gonna die here.

2236
02:15:17,740 --> 02:15:21,800
Where is he?!

2237
02:15:24,510 --> 02:15:25,190
There you go.

2238
02:15:25,190 --> 02:15:25,890
I freed him.

2239
02:15:26,290 --> 02:15:27,410
You're free now.

2240
02:15:31,620 --> 02:15:32,280
Nice.

2241
02:15:32,740 --> 02:15:33,140
Alright.

2242
02:15:34,440 --> 02:15:35,060
Nice.

2243
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:37,000
We did it.

2244
02:15:39,400 --> 02:15:41,000
He's right there.

2245
02:15:41,060 --> 02:15:41,840
He's gone.

2246
02:15:43,500 --> 02:15:44,420
I gotta dance.

2247
02:15:44,680 --> 02:15:45,540
Gotta dance!

2248
02:15:49,740 --> 02:15:51,060
I should turn on my humidifier.

2249
02:15:51,120 --> 02:15:52,160
I got a humidifier, guys.

2250
02:15:54,120 --> 02:15:55,280
Orlyx was my life.

2251
02:15:55,840 --> 02:15:57,660
But wouldn't it be fabulous to have an awesome...

2252
02:15:57,660 --> 02:15:59,440
Because the air's been like super dry lately.

2253
02:15:59,640 --> 02:16:00,800
So I had to get a humidifier.

2254
02:16:03,880 --> 02:16:05,320
I think we're doing pretty well.

2255
02:16:05,520 --> 02:16:06,160
Climb-wise.

2256
02:16:07,660 --> 02:16:09,520
We're like up 80 points.

2257
02:16:10,200 --> 02:16:11,880
If we hit plat 2, it's possible.

2258
02:16:13,440 --> 02:16:17,100
I think we can hit plat 2 by...

2259
02:16:17,960 --> 02:16:20,480
In an hour, I think we can...

2260
02:16:20,480 --> 02:16:22,100
I think we can get to plat 1 within...

2261
02:16:23,040 --> 02:16:24,460
I think...

2262
02:16:24,460 --> 02:16:25,680
I think it's possible!

2263
02:16:27,380 --> 02:16:30,540
Because plat 1 is top 500.

2264
02:16:34,940 --> 02:16:35,820
Take the fist.

2265
02:16:37,800 --> 02:16:39,700
No, don't say that, guys.

2266
02:16:39,780 --> 02:16:40,880
Don't say that.

2267
02:16:43,160 --> 02:16:45,820
Guys, don't say it's gonna be a long stream.

2268
02:16:47,100 --> 02:16:48,040
It's possible.

2269
02:16:48,740 --> 02:16:50,240
It's so possible.

2270
02:16:53,850 --> 02:16:54,280
Guys.

2271
02:16:55,480 --> 02:16:57,680
You just gotta give me your energy.

2272
02:16:59,360 --> 02:17:01,260
Oh shit, there's Hawkeye.

2273
02:17:01,360 --> 02:17:03,020
There's Hawkeye's ult.

2274
02:17:03,920 --> 02:17:04,620
Oh no!

2275
02:17:08,840 --> 02:17:10,440
That's all of us!

2276
02:17:11,640 --> 02:17:12,360
No!

2277
02:17:13,700 --> 02:17:15,200
I heard it.

2278
02:17:15,460 --> 02:17:16,580
I heard the...

2279
02:17:17,100 --> 02:17:17,380
Wow.

2280
02:17:22,850 --> 02:17:25,040
Guys, I even ran.

2281
02:17:25,620 --> 02:17:29,460
I insta-ran too, but it didn't matter.

2282
02:17:30,120 --> 02:17:32,220
It didn't fucking matter.

2283
02:17:32,880 --> 02:17:34,260
That's the worst part.

2284
02:17:35,140 --> 02:17:37,250
I ran so fucking fast.

2285
02:17:37,880 --> 02:17:39,560
The moment I could...

2286
02:17:39,990 --> 02:17:43,440
The moment I could, I just fucking booked it.

2287
02:17:43,700 --> 02:17:45,860
But it didn't matter.

2288
02:17:47,100 --> 02:17:48,700
It didn't matter.

2289
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:52,400
There's just no counter, I feel like.

2290
02:17:52,720 --> 02:17:55,380
There is a counter, just shoot it, but still.

2291
02:17:57,340 --> 02:17:58,820
It's so close.

2292
02:18:01,260 --> 02:18:01,840
Okay.

2293
02:18:03,640 --> 02:18:04,540
Get frozen.

2294
02:18:06,480 --> 02:18:06,940
Okay.

2295
02:18:07,720 --> 02:18:09,200
You need to do this, because you're all low.

2296
02:18:10,440 --> 02:18:11,240
Then you...

2297
02:18:11,240 --> 02:18:12,780
You can do this.

2298
02:18:13,460 --> 02:18:14,720
And I'm gonna dance here.

2299
02:18:14,720 --> 02:18:17,100
I want... Oh, can I use this aggressively?

2300
02:18:17,880 --> 02:18:21,160
I don't know, it's very risky to use this aggressively, but...

2301
02:18:21,160 --> 02:18:22,140
I'm gonna use it aggressively.

2302
02:18:23,280 --> 02:18:24,180
I'm gonna do it.

2303
02:18:24,380 --> 02:18:25,780
Come on, push with this.

2304
02:18:26,240 --> 02:18:27,100
Push with this.

2305
02:18:27,360 --> 02:18:28,120
I knew it.

2306
02:18:30,540 --> 02:18:31,420
Oh no.

2307
02:18:32,760 --> 02:18:33,640
Oh no.

2308
02:18:35,640 --> 02:18:38,280
That was a huge risk to use it aggressively.

2309
02:18:40,700 --> 02:18:42,800
I felt like there was nothing else I could do.

2310
02:18:47,040 --> 02:18:48,960
There's nothing else I could do there.

2311
02:18:50,120 --> 02:18:52,220
Guys, something's not working.

2312
02:18:52,400 --> 02:18:54,940
We gotta change something, guys.

2313
02:18:56,920 --> 02:18:59,460
I think we gotta change our comp.

2314
02:18:59,560 --> 02:19:01,300
Maybe change the Widowmaker?

2315
02:19:03,240 --> 02:19:04,360
I don't know.

2316
02:19:05,120 --> 02:19:05,400
No!

2317
02:19:14,260 --> 02:19:15,060
Goodbye.

2318
02:19:18,760 --> 02:19:19,760
Every time.

2319
02:19:23,020 --> 02:19:26,200
I'm red, I'm red.

2320
02:19:28,360 --> 02:19:30,800
I'm red, I'm red.

2321
02:19:31,200 --> 02:19:32,420
There's no...

2322
02:19:32,420 --> 02:19:35,800
You hear the ult sound and I'm red!

2323
02:19:36,500 --> 02:19:37,640
I'm red!

2324
02:19:40,380 --> 02:19:42,640
I'm red so far.

2325
02:19:43,500 --> 02:19:44,320
You don't understand.

2326
02:19:45,380 --> 02:19:46,740
I am so red.

2327
02:19:49,220 --> 02:19:51,720
This is a good Jeff map.

2328
02:19:51,720 --> 02:19:52,880
You can't see!

2329
02:19:53,460 --> 02:19:57,220
It's cause this is actually a good Jeff map, chat!

2330
02:20:02,540 --> 02:20:04,080
Oh no, that's bad.

2331
02:20:09,300 --> 02:20:10,260
This is bad.

2332
02:20:10,340 --> 02:20:11,240
We lost two already.

2333
02:20:18,410 --> 02:20:19,230
Okay, nice.

2334
02:20:20,210 --> 02:20:21,450
Oh no, nice!

2335
02:20:23,730 --> 02:20:24,870
Oh, we recovered.

2336
02:20:25,090 --> 02:20:26,930
Holy shit, we recovered it.

2337
02:20:27,470 --> 02:20:28,450
That's so good.

2338
02:20:31,390 --> 02:20:33,790
Oh my god, what the fuck?

2339
02:20:34,470 --> 02:20:34,870
What?

2340
02:20:35,170 --> 02:20:36,310
Oh, they're going in!

2341
02:20:38,250 --> 02:20:41,530
He just beats them up and goes in!

2342
02:20:42,770 --> 02:20:45,470
He's like, I'm not done with you!

2343
02:20:48,270 --> 02:20:51,710
I like how Dr. Strange didn't even go in there.

2344
02:20:52,710 --> 02:20:55,030
He's just like, yeah, I'm not fucking done with you.

2345
02:20:55,810 --> 02:20:58,910
Oh no, he's gonna fucking smash, guys.

2346
02:21:01,710 --> 02:21:04,010
Oh my god, I don't need to use it yet.

2347
02:21:04,530 --> 02:21:05,670
There's no reason to.

2348
02:21:06,570 --> 02:21:07,210
No!

2349
02:21:07,670 --> 02:21:08,210
No!

2350
02:21:09,370 --> 02:21:10,010
No!

2351
02:21:10,690 --> 02:21:11,990
You can't eat me!

2352
02:21:15,930 --> 02:21:17,230
I had to!

2353
02:21:17,710 --> 02:21:19,070
I fucking had to!

2354
02:21:19,150 --> 02:21:21,110
It was the only way to live!

2355
02:21:24,950 --> 02:21:26,030
Oh my god!

2356
02:21:26,490 --> 02:21:28,430
Oh my god!

2357
02:21:28,510 --> 02:21:30,090
Oh my god, I'm alive!

2358
02:21:31,870 --> 02:21:33,490
I ulted to live!

2359
02:21:34,050 --> 02:21:35,970
I actually ulted to live there!

2360
02:21:38,350 --> 02:21:39,430
Oh no, no!

2361
02:21:40,870 --> 02:21:42,670
Wait, oh, we can... we got this.

2362
02:21:43,250 --> 02:21:44,070
Guys, get the point!

2363
02:21:44,170 --> 02:21:44,590
Get the point!

2364
02:21:44,670 --> 02:21:45,170
Get the point!

2365
02:21:45,330 --> 02:21:45,810
Stay on point!

2366
02:21:47,110 --> 02:21:48,110
Stay on point, please!

2367
02:21:48,350 --> 02:21:48,890
Stay on point!

2368
02:21:49,050 --> 02:21:49,590
Stay on point!

2369
02:21:52,710 --> 02:21:54,870
The champ is a menace.

2370
02:21:55,350 --> 02:21:57,630
Not again!

2371
02:21:58,310 --> 02:21:59,250
Not again!

2372
02:22:03,430 --> 02:22:04,410
Not again!

2373
02:22:04,730 --> 02:22:05,970
Not again!

2374
02:22:06,070 --> 02:22:06,690
I can't!

2375
02:22:06,750 --> 02:22:09,150
I can't keep getting eaten by Jeff!

2376
02:22:14,230 --> 02:22:15,250
Not again!

2377
02:22:20,060 --> 02:22:21,640
Jeff's so hungry.

2378
02:22:22,380 --> 02:22:23,920
So hungry!

2379
02:22:28,000 --> 02:22:30,040
Wait, BRB.

2380
02:22:30,780 --> 02:22:31,560
Bathroom.

2381
02:22:32,080 --> 02:22:34,000
Don't... okay, I hope he doesn't Q instantly.

2382
02:23:40,500 --> 02:23:41,380
I'm back.

2383
02:23:41,580 --> 02:23:42,380
I'm back.

2384
02:23:44,120 --> 02:23:47,680
Okay, that shit was so fucking scary.

2385
02:23:48,140 --> 02:23:49,240
Holy fuck.

2386
02:23:51,280 --> 02:23:53,080
I swear it was targeted.

2387
02:23:53,600 --> 02:23:54,120
I swear.

2388
02:23:54,920 --> 02:23:56,380
There's no way it wasn't.

2389
02:23:56,520 --> 02:23:58,060
That shit felt so targeted.

2390
02:23:59,060 --> 02:24:00,580
I was like, what the fuck do I do?

2391
02:24:05,240 --> 02:24:09,620
I literally had to like... I ulted just so I could stay alive.

2392
02:24:09,820 --> 02:24:15,260
I ulted so I don't have to deal with Jeff's fucking bullshit.

2393
02:24:20,240 --> 02:24:24,100
The thing is, when you're ulted, he can't eat you.

2394
02:24:24,420 --> 02:24:26,960
So he's still trying to fucking eat me!

2395
02:24:28,300 --> 02:24:29,980
That's so fucked up!

2396
02:24:30,620 --> 02:24:35,720
Like, I ulted so he doesn't eat me and he still tried!

2397
02:24:36,400 --> 02:24:38,340
What the fuck is wrong with you?

2398
02:24:45,710 --> 02:24:47,500
There's something not right about him.

2399
02:24:52,060 --> 02:24:52,400
Alright.

2400
02:24:54,800 --> 02:24:57,800
He said Jeff is a good dog.

2401
02:25:01,480 --> 02:25:02,300
It sucks.

2402
02:25:02,380 --> 02:25:04,400
That was actually a really good Jeff map too.

2403
02:25:09,180 --> 02:25:09,740
Alright.

2404
02:25:10,780 --> 02:25:15,860
See, this is why people are like, why is everybody hating on... This is why.

2405
02:25:16,980 --> 02:25:17,940
Now you know.

2406
02:25:18,020 --> 02:25:23,240
For those who don't play Marvel Rivals, now you know why people hate Jeff so much.

2407
02:25:23,620 --> 02:25:24,820
Now you know.

2408
02:25:25,140 --> 02:25:27,080
Now you feel our pain.

2409
02:25:32,270 --> 02:25:33,490
What the fuck is that sound?

2410
02:25:33,550 --> 02:25:33,930
I was like...

2411
02:25:36,010 --> 02:25:37,330
I'm gonna use this.

2412
02:25:37,690 --> 02:25:39,250
I think they're taking too much damage.

2413
02:25:40,110 --> 02:25:42,190
Then you heal both tanks at the same time.

2414
02:25:42,210 --> 02:25:42,590
Woah!

2415
02:25:44,250 --> 02:25:45,810
What the fuck?

2416
02:25:46,710 --> 02:25:47,250
Oh shit.

2417
02:25:48,690 --> 02:25:49,890
Please, please!

2418
02:25:50,370 --> 02:25:51,910
I didn't even ping!

2419
02:25:52,350 --> 02:25:54,610
I didn't even ping for heals!

2420
02:25:59,370 --> 02:26:00,410
Mantis, please.

2421
02:26:01,030 --> 02:26:03,770
We gotta help each other, Mantis!

2422
02:26:07,330 --> 02:26:09,630
Mantis, we have to... Oh, you're alive.

2423
02:26:09,730 --> 02:26:10,530
Of course you are.

2424
02:26:11,670 --> 02:26:13,140
Of course you're alive.

2425
02:26:17,070 --> 02:26:17,610
Okay.

2426
02:26:22,940 --> 02:26:24,460
Of course you're alive, Mantis.

2427
02:26:24,600 --> 02:26:24,880
Whoopies.

2428
02:26:25,420 --> 02:26:26,320
Oh my god.

2429
02:26:26,400 --> 02:26:30,540
I could easily just, you know, let you die so you know how I felt.

2430
02:26:33,320 --> 02:26:35,400
Bro is on Ironman?

2431
02:26:35,580 --> 02:26:36,780
No way!

2432
02:26:38,160 --> 02:26:40,940
He's a really good Ironman, guys!

2433
02:26:41,980 --> 02:26:42,820
Oh no.

2434
02:26:44,020 --> 02:26:44,760
Okay, nice.

2435
02:26:45,460 --> 02:26:47,220
Oh no, not the moon!

2436
02:26:48,640 --> 02:26:49,960
Oh no!

2437
02:26:53,320 --> 02:26:55,820
Okay, that was a really good snowball from me.

2438
02:26:58,660 --> 02:26:59,800
Oh my god.

2439
02:27:02,600 --> 02:27:03,080
Okay.

2440
02:27:03,080 --> 02:27:03,160
Okay, nice.

2441
02:27:06,020 --> 02:27:06,500
Okay.

2442
02:27:09,940 --> 02:27:10,960
She's so low!

2443
02:27:11,400 --> 02:27:12,100
I got her!

2444
02:27:12,900 --> 02:27:14,480
Whoops, that wall needed freezing.

2445
02:27:16,240 --> 02:27:18,480
Why the fuck do we have Ironman?

2446
02:27:19,900 --> 02:27:20,780
Is he okay?

2447
02:27:21,400 --> 02:27:22,780
No, he's not Ironman.

2448
02:27:22,940 --> 02:27:23,500
What is he?

2449
02:27:27,460 --> 02:27:29,060
Oh, he's not Ironman anymore.

2450
02:27:29,160 --> 02:27:30,500
Yeah, I was like, what the fuck?

2451
02:27:31,560 --> 02:27:33,080
He just wants to be in the air.

2452
02:27:36,960 --> 02:27:37,620
Okay.

2453
02:27:38,280 --> 02:27:40,120
Alright, here we go!

2454
02:27:40,920 --> 02:27:42,780
It's time to dance!

2455
02:27:44,740 --> 02:27:45,400
Yippee!

2456
02:27:48,060 --> 02:27:50,180
It's dance time!

2457
02:27:51,880 --> 02:27:52,540
Yippee!

2458
02:27:53,460 --> 02:27:54,240
What am I?

2459
02:27:54,720 --> 02:27:56,320
Oh, got hella.

2460
02:27:56,800 --> 02:27:58,360
Get shit on, bitch.

2461
02:28:01,360 --> 02:28:02,520
Oh my god.

2462
02:28:03,400 --> 02:28:04,580
I'm so low.

2463
02:28:05,700 --> 02:28:09,220
Somebody can poke me and I'll be fucking dead.

2464
02:28:12,360 --> 02:28:14,740
Please, oh my god, please!

2465
02:28:15,380 --> 02:28:16,220
Thank you!

2466
02:28:18,100 --> 02:28:25,080
I just, I needed, I was gonna say, I just need, if somebody touches me once, I'm fucking dead.

2467
02:28:27,980 --> 02:28:28,600
Nice.

2468
02:28:30,380 --> 02:28:31,180
Oh, I have C!

2469
02:28:31,460 --> 02:28:32,740
I forgot about the C!

2470
02:28:34,020 --> 02:28:35,240
Oh my god, again!

2471
02:28:36,440 --> 02:28:37,420
Yes, again!

2472
02:28:41,380 --> 02:28:42,020
Again!

2473
02:28:43,720 --> 02:28:44,040
Again!

2474
02:28:47,360 --> 02:28:48,300
Holy shit!

2475
02:28:48,620 --> 02:28:51,860
Is he having a ga- OH MY GOD, TRIPPER, YOU'RE FUCKING CRAZY!

2476
02:28:52,580 --> 02:28:53,260
GET OUT!

2477
02:28:54,060 --> 02:28:55,420
GET OUT, TRIPPER!

2478
02:28:57,980 --> 02:28:59,260
Holy shit!

2479
02:28:59,260 --> 02:29:02,460
The again chain!

2480
02:29:03,060 --> 02:29:03,900
Again!

2481
02:29:05,820 --> 02:29:07,720
Oh, he died!

2482
02:29:08,960 --> 02:29:10,580
He actually died.

2483
02:29:10,940 --> 02:29:12,660
Bro, that sucks, bro.

2484
02:29:20,780 --> 02:29:22,060
Alright, here we go.

2485
02:29:24,100 --> 02:29:25,480
Alright, let's go.

2486
02:29:26,100 --> 02:29:26,620
He's fine.

2487
02:29:30,420 --> 02:29:31,180
Nice.

2488
02:29:31,720 --> 02:29:33,800
We used a lot of ults there, but that's okay.

2489
02:29:35,400 --> 02:29:36,440
We're fine.

2490
02:29:37,300 --> 02:29:38,480
Everything is fine.

2491
02:29:39,540 --> 02:29:40,300
Again!

2492
02:29:45,420 --> 02:29:49,260
I can't believe, like, he actually...

2493
02:29:52,940 --> 02:29:53,700
Nice.

2494
02:29:53,700 --> 02:29:54,140
Oh...

2495
02:29:56,420 --> 02:29:58,280
Oh, I had to do it!

2496
02:29:58,740 --> 02:29:59,700
I got...

2497
02:30:06,980 --> 02:30:08,320
I had to!

2498
02:30:09,560 --> 02:30:11,520
Oh, this is where we die, though!

2499
02:30:13,200 --> 02:30:15,480
This is where I should have used it.

2500
02:30:17,140 --> 02:30:18,300
Oh my god, wait, what?

2501
02:30:18,360 --> 02:30:18,660
Again?

2502
02:30:19,500 --> 02:30:20,620
Oh my god, again!

2503
02:30:22,560 --> 02:30:23,580
Don't worry, I got it.

2504
02:30:23,680 --> 02:30:24,320
I'm coming over.

2505
02:30:26,240 --> 02:30:29,020
I don't know if he was saying that sarcastically or not.

2506
02:30:29,360 --> 02:30:30,460
I don't know!

2507
02:30:36,640 --> 02:30:41,020
Yeah, I'm just gonna try and keep...

2508
02:30:41,020 --> 02:30:41,600
He's Groot!

2509
02:30:44,700 --> 02:30:46,140
Oh shit, he's Grooting!

2510
02:30:47,140 --> 02:30:48,460
He's Grooting right now!

2511
02:30:48,460 --> 02:30:49,960
Anti-Psylocke on the left side.

2512
02:30:53,380 --> 02:30:55,920
Oh my god!

2513
02:31:02,020 --> 02:31:02,800
Okay.

2514
02:31:11,640 --> 02:31:15,200
Oh my god, what do I do there?!

2515
02:31:15,980 --> 02:31:16,380
No!

2516
02:31:17,240 --> 02:31:20,360
That's like everything in Grooted!

2517
02:31:23,900 --> 02:31:26,360
I was like, what do I do?!

2518
02:31:27,200 --> 02:31:30,020
Everybody wanted to fucking kill me!

2519
02:31:34,920 --> 02:31:36,540
That's fucking scary, that's for sure.

2520
02:31:39,560 --> 02:31:40,400
The way I push up.

2521
02:31:44,590 --> 02:31:45,670
Let's go!

2522
02:31:46,710 --> 02:31:47,270
Let's

2523
02:31:50,460 --> 02:31:51,300
dancing!

2524
02:32:05,490 --> 02:32:06,170
Yeah!

2525
02:32:06,170 --> 02:32:10,130
I used up all my cooldowns!

2526
02:32:10,210 --> 02:32:20,930
If I didn't use a freeze, if a fucking giant venom, giant thick-ass toxic shadow ran at me, that's when you know I had no cooldowns.

2527
02:32:20,990 --> 02:32:24,030
That's when you know I had no freeze.

2528
02:32:30,310 --> 02:32:32,950
I didn't consecute everything that I did.

2529
02:32:33,990 --> 02:32:38,290
You think I willingly stared him down without freezing him, chat?!

2530
02:32:38,290 --> 02:32:40,930
You think that was consensual?!

2531
02:32:41,690 --> 02:32:43,970
Like, I had no free cooldowns!

2532
02:32:44,530 --> 02:32:45,590
Well, except for, you know.

2533
02:32:48,670 --> 02:32:50,850
I don't know about TPing on this point, because they can kind of see us.

2534
02:32:51,990 --> 02:32:53,350
Yeah, I mean, only if I'd rotate.

2535
02:32:53,550 --> 02:32:55,150
He's literally right.

2536
02:32:56,730 --> 02:33:05,150
As he slowly walked up to me, the first thing I wasn't thinking about was like, I gotta do this, I gotta...

2537
02:33:15,310 --> 02:33:18,050
This is the sad part.

2538
02:33:18,650 --> 02:33:20,470
I don't have C, he's moonlight.

2539
02:33:26,130 --> 02:33:28,130
I am Groot.

2540
02:33:28,590 --> 02:33:41,030
Alright, I think I froze somebody, yeah I did.

2541
02:33:41,530 --> 02:33:42,570
OH SHIT!

2542
02:33:46,740 --> 02:33:47,580
God, bitch.

2543
02:33:48,060 --> 02:33:49,400
That's fucking right.

2544
02:33:49,980 --> 02:33:51,760
Be afraid of me!

2545
02:33:53,220 --> 02:33:56,960
I am a Luna Snow that can fucking aim!

2546
02:33:58,140 --> 02:33:59,940
That's fucking right!

2547
02:34:01,940 --> 02:34:04,000
Be a fairy afraid!

2548
02:34:07,780 --> 02:34:09,320
Oh my gosh.

2549
02:34:10,260 --> 02:34:12,440
I need to do this, for the stronger heals.

2550
02:34:13,080 --> 02:34:13,780
OH MY GOD!

2551
02:34:14,320 --> 02:34:15,220
BE AFRAID!

2552
02:34:16,820 --> 02:34:17,540
HAHAHAHAHA!

2553
02:34:20,960 --> 02:34:22,220
That's fucking right!

2554
02:34:23,080 --> 02:34:24,260
That's fucking right!

2555
02:34:28,780 --> 02:34:31,300
Be fucking afraid of me!

2556
02:34:33,880 --> 02:34:36,200
You're the deepest healer!

2557
02:34:38,740 --> 02:34:42,520
Cause there's a lot of Luna Snows that just know how to heal and can't aim.

2558
02:34:44,180 --> 02:34:47,920
But I'm not, I'm not that type of Luna.

2559
02:34:48,320 --> 02:34:51,680
Okay, let's just dance a little bit, guys.

2560
02:34:52,260 --> 02:34:55,000
Let's just... let's just...

2561
02:34:55,000 --> 02:34:55,520
Yay!

2562
02:34:57,400 --> 02:34:58,160
Yay!

2563
02:35:02,120 --> 02:35:02,880
Again!

2564
02:35:03,940 --> 02:35:04,620
Where did he go?

2565
02:35:06,300 --> 02:35:06,480
Oh!

2566
02:35:07,180 --> 02:35:09,980
I was trying to find where he went!

2567
02:35:09,980 --> 02:35:12,520
Where did he go?

2568
02:35:15,730 --> 02:35:16,780
Alright, nice.

2569
02:35:18,440 --> 02:35:19,220
Again!

2570
02:35:21,160 --> 02:35:21,940
Again!

2571
02:35:22,700 --> 02:35:23,540
Oh, there he is.

2572
02:35:23,880 --> 02:35:25,060
There they go.

2573
02:35:25,200 --> 02:35:26,140
Oh, they can't...

2574
02:35:26,140 --> 02:35:26,900
HAHAHAHAHA!

2575
02:35:26,900 --> 02:35:28,280
You're so toxic!

2576
02:35:28,960 --> 02:35:31,000
You're so toxic!

2577
02:35:32,700 --> 02:35:33,180
Easy.

2578
02:35:36,460 --> 02:35:37,020
HAHAHAHAHA!

2579
02:35:37,700 --> 02:35:39,560
Cause you know how, like...

2580
02:35:39,560 --> 02:35:41,820
You know how, like, um...

2581
02:35:41,820 --> 02:35:42,200
Maywa?

2582
02:35:42,400 --> 02:35:44,680
You can break the Maywa by shooting at it?

2583
02:35:44,940 --> 02:35:46,360
I don't think you can do...

2584
02:35:46,360 --> 02:35:46,980
Again!

2585
02:35:47,480 --> 02:35:49,400
I don't think you can do that with...

2586
02:35:49,400 --> 02:35:50,300
Um...

2587
02:35:50,300 --> 02:35:51,180
With Groot.

2588
02:35:51,460 --> 02:35:51,720
Yay!

2589
02:35:53,920 --> 02:35:55,440
One more rank, guys!

2590
02:35:55,700 --> 02:35:56,800
One more rank!

2591
02:35:57,280 --> 02:35:58,700
One more rank up!

2592
02:36:01,450 --> 02:36:01,770
Two!

2593
02:36:04,730 --> 02:36:05,290
We're good!

2594
02:36:05,290 --> 02:36:05,830
We're gaining!

2595
02:36:07,050 --> 02:36:08,250
We got one more!

2596
02:36:08,890 --> 02:36:09,570
We have one more.

2597
02:36:09,650 --> 02:36:10,070
Yeah, I saw.

2598
02:36:10,210 --> 02:36:11,230
He's going for...

2599
02:36:11,230 --> 02:36:11,990
Coke.

2600
02:36:14,210 --> 02:36:14,650
Um...

2601
02:36:14,650 --> 02:36:15,990
Yes, it's still plat one!

2602
02:36:16,450 --> 02:36:18,090
Oh my god, we're so close!

2603
02:36:19,430 --> 02:36:21,090
Okay, yeah, it's full plat one.

2604
02:36:21,290 --> 02:36:22,290
Okay, there's like...

2605
02:36:22,870 --> 02:36:23,990
A full hundred page...

2606
02:36:23,990 --> 02:36:25,370
A full hundred people.

2607
02:36:25,910 --> 02:36:26,950
Oh my god!

2608
02:36:27,230 --> 02:36:28,330
We're so close!

2609
02:36:29,970 --> 02:36:30,410
HAHAHAHAHA!

2610
02:36:39,360 --> 02:36:39,700
Yeah!

2611
02:36:42,440 --> 02:36:43,320
I'm so...

2612
02:36:43,320 --> 02:36:44,680
Can you put three...

2613
02:36:44,680 --> 02:36:45,340
Oh, you can?

2614
02:36:46,040 --> 02:36:48,560
I feel like it's so hard to break the Groot wall.

2615
02:36:48,860 --> 02:36:50,340
I shot at the Groot wall...

2616
02:36:50,340 --> 02:36:51,960
And it's so fucking hard to break it.

2617
02:36:52,240 --> 02:36:53,880
But him being able to put three of them...

2618
02:36:53,880 --> 02:36:54,880
Is actually pretty fucked up.

2619
02:36:55,220 --> 02:36:55,660
Like...

2620
02:36:55,660 --> 02:36:56,820
I think you got...

2621
02:36:56,820 --> 02:36:58,860
There's a lot of things you got to nerf...

2622
02:36:58,860 --> 02:36:59,460
In...

2623
02:36:59,460 --> 02:37:00,560
Marvel Watch.

2624
02:37:01,440 --> 02:37:01,660
Haha!

2625
02:37:01,680 --> 02:37:02,780
Marvel Arrivals.

2626
02:37:03,180 --> 02:37:04,500
Golden Freeman, thank you for the superchat!

2627
02:37:04,600 --> 02:37:05,400
Thank you!

2628
02:37:06,000 --> 02:37:06,440
Um...

2629
02:37:06,440 --> 02:37:11,680
I still can't believe the first 3D animation from these mods was a Hulk making Jeff bite the curb.

2630
02:37:12,260 --> 02:37:12,620
HAHAHA!

2631
02:37:13,260 --> 02:37:13,980
Look...

2632
02:37:13,980 --> 02:37:16,260
That was fueled by pure hate, guys.

2633
02:37:16,740 --> 02:37:17,180
That...

2634
02:37:17,180 --> 02:37:18,360
That was...

2635
02:37:18,360 --> 02:37:19,420
That was...

2636
02:37:19,420 --> 02:37:21,340
Hate transcends...

2637
02:37:21,340 --> 02:37:22,880
Guys, you guys gotta know...

2638
02:37:23,440 --> 02:37:23,920
Hate...

2639
02:37:24,240 --> 02:37:24,600
Uh...

2640
02:37:24,600 --> 02:37:26,620
Transcends over...

2641
02:37:26,620 --> 02:37:27,480
Um...

2642
02:37:27,480 --> 02:37:28,200
Over lust.

2643
02:37:29,200 --> 02:37:29,920
HAHAHAHAHA!

2644
02:37:30,480 --> 02:37:32,500
If you hate something...

2645
02:37:32,500 --> 02:37:34,320
That is a bigger motivator.

2646
02:37:35,200 --> 02:37:35,820
HAHAHAHAHA!

2647
02:37:37,320 --> 02:37:37,940
HAHAHAHAHA!

2648
02:37:40,080 --> 02:37:41,320
For real...

2649
02:37:41,320 --> 02:37:42,000
HAHAHA!

2650
02:37:42,440 --> 02:37:45,820
I am more motivated from spite than anything else.

2651
02:37:46,860 --> 02:37:48,080
Oh my god...

2652
02:37:48,080 --> 02:37:48,480
I hope...

2653
02:37:48,480 --> 02:37:51,740
I hope my Luna Snow gameplay has been fun to watch.

2654
02:37:51,860 --> 02:37:52,540
Cause I know like...

2655
02:37:52,540 --> 02:37:54,140
Sometimes support's not that...

2656
02:37:54,140 --> 02:37:55,540
Fun to watch...

2657
02:37:55,540 --> 02:37:56,000
Overall.

2658
02:37:56,740 --> 02:37:57,700
But like...

2659
02:37:57,700 --> 02:37:58,160
I'm...

2660
02:37:58,160 --> 02:37:59,440
I'm DPSing a bit.

2661
02:37:59,580 --> 02:37:59,920
I'm...

2662
02:37:59,920 --> 02:38:00,380
HAHAHA!

2663
02:38:00,560 --> 02:38:01,180
I mean...

2664
02:38:01,180 --> 02:38:01,920
I killed that...

2665
02:38:01,920 --> 02:38:02,960
You saw that...

2666
02:38:02,960 --> 02:38:05,280
Sick kill on the sidelock there?

2667
02:38:05,680 --> 02:38:06,060
You saw...

2668
02:38:06,620 --> 02:38:06,880
HAHAHA!

2669
02:38:08,260 --> 02:38:08,780
HAHAHA!

2670
02:38:12,830 --> 02:38:13,390
I'm glad.

2671
02:38:13,650 --> 02:38:14,870
I'm glad it's fun to watch.

2672
02:38:18,560 --> 02:38:19,080
Yay!

2673
02:38:20,340 --> 02:38:22,980
The battle from the backlines.

2674
02:38:24,040 --> 02:38:24,980
Oh my god.

2675
02:38:26,220 --> 02:38:26,740
Yes!

2676
02:38:26,960 --> 02:38:27,540
There we go.

2677
02:38:28,800 --> 02:38:30,560
I like how we get like the same...

2678
02:38:30,560 --> 02:38:32,700
Like usually the same people in this ELO.

2679
02:38:32,780 --> 02:38:33,960
Cause there's not a lot of...

2680
02:38:33,960 --> 02:38:34,840
Us anymore.

2681
02:38:35,520 --> 02:38:36,060
HAHAHA!

2682
02:38:36,920 --> 02:38:37,460
HAHAHA!

2683
02:38:38,460 --> 02:38:38,940
HAHAHA!

2684
02:38:39,520 --> 02:38:42,620
So we're just bumping into the same people over and over again.

2685
02:38:43,940 --> 02:38:45,280
No, don't say that.

2686
02:38:45,600 --> 02:38:45,860
No.

2687
02:38:46,260 --> 02:38:47,260
Don't say that guys.

2688
02:38:47,460 --> 02:38:47,680
Please.

2689
02:38:47,780 --> 02:38:49,040
I don't want to derank you...

2690
02:38:49,040 --> 02:38:50,380
Already guys.

2691
02:38:50,500 --> 02:38:50,660
Please.

2692
02:38:50,760 --> 02:38:51,880
I worked so hard.

2693
02:38:52,220 --> 02:38:52,680
HAHAHA!

2694
02:38:55,300 --> 02:38:55,840
Alright.

2695
02:38:58,100 --> 02:38:58,920
Oh my god.

2696
02:38:58,980 --> 02:38:59,540
It's possible!

2697
02:38:59,960 --> 02:39:00,540
It's possible!

2698
02:39:02,660 --> 02:39:03,200
Okay.

2699
02:39:03,200 --> 02:39:06,540
It took a little longer cause we kept bumping into Luna mains.

2700
02:39:07,040 --> 02:39:08,380
But like it's getting easier.

2701
02:39:10,460 --> 02:39:13,380
The moment we don't have another Luna main...

2702
02:39:13,380 --> 02:39:15,200
And I get to play Luna...

2703
02:39:15,720 --> 02:39:16,680
Everything is okay.

2704
02:39:17,560 --> 02:39:19,140
Everything is okay guys.

2705
02:39:19,480 --> 02:39:22,100
I just avoid all the Luna snow players.

2706
02:39:22,860 --> 02:39:23,340
HAHAHA!

2707
02:39:26,380 --> 02:39:28,560
It's just like Overwatch where you have to like...

2708
02:39:28,560 --> 02:39:29,260
Shoot these.

2709
02:39:30,040 --> 02:39:31,940
For better angles and stuff.

2710
02:39:33,200 --> 02:39:36,840
I have to like get rid of these railings so I can see.

2711
02:39:37,440 --> 02:39:38,840
I'm gonna be able to see.

2712
02:39:39,900 --> 02:39:42,600
Okay, this can be broken too but I don't want to break it.

2713
02:39:42,740 --> 02:39:44,200
Cause I can use this as cover.

2714
02:39:49,120 --> 02:39:49,620
Okay.

2715
02:39:58,510 --> 02:39:59,770
Nice, I froze Groot.

2716
02:39:59,870 --> 02:40:00,590
Oh no!

2717
02:40:01,170 --> 02:40:05,370
Groot is so fucking tilting the play against.

2718
02:40:08,030 --> 02:40:09,210
It really is.

2719
02:40:12,030 --> 02:40:13,930
I need to do this cause our tank needs help.

2720
02:40:15,010 --> 02:40:16,910
I can do double tank heals right here.

2721
02:40:17,350 --> 02:40:18,250
Oh my god.

2722
02:40:22,490 --> 02:40:24,330
Wait, I just realized I never used my...

2723
02:40:24,330 --> 02:40:25,110
Oh no!

2724
02:40:25,690 --> 02:40:27,090
Oh, I'm backing out though.

2725
02:40:32,370 --> 02:40:32,810
Okay.

2726
02:40:34,890 --> 02:40:35,610
Oh no!

2727
02:40:36,310 --> 02:40:37,370
I couldn't heal him!

2728
02:40:42,040 --> 02:40:43,340
What the fuck is Shurpa?

2729
02:40:43,520 --> 02:40:45,380
How am I supposed to give you this?

2730
02:40:46,060 --> 02:40:47,260
I'm gonna give it to the tank for now.

2731
02:40:48,120 --> 02:40:49,180
Oh my, there he is.

2732
02:40:50,500 --> 02:40:50,900
Oh!

2733
02:40:51,560 --> 02:40:53,060
I looked away for a sec!

2734
02:40:53,100 --> 02:40:53,880
I'm sorry!

2735
02:40:56,080 --> 02:40:56,880
Okay, there you go.

2736
02:41:00,120 --> 02:41:01,480
I'm sorry I looked away!

2737
02:41:04,820 --> 02:41:07,560
To be fair, he has a pocket mantis.

2738
02:41:08,060 --> 02:41:09,100
So I legitimately don't have to look.

2739
02:41:09,300 --> 02:41:09,940
Oh shit.

2740
02:41:11,640 --> 02:41:13,160
He actually has a pocket mantis.

2741
02:41:13,200 --> 02:41:14,380
So I'm just gonna heal the left side.

2742
02:41:14,660 --> 02:41:15,660
Okay, he's dead.

2743
02:41:21,600 --> 02:41:22,240
Okay.

2744
02:41:22,460 --> 02:41:22,820
Okay.

2745
02:41:22,820 --> 02:41:23,400
That's awkward.

2746
02:41:24,980 --> 02:41:26,680
That's so awkward.

2747
02:41:27,200 --> 02:41:27,640
Okay.

2748
02:41:28,120 --> 02:41:30,320
I did not expect that to happen.

2749
02:41:30,520 --> 02:41:31,480
Not gonna lie.

2750
02:41:33,000 --> 02:41:36,520
You know, I thought he would honestly live a little longer.

2751
02:41:37,560 --> 02:41:38,260
Oh no.

2752
02:41:38,620 --> 02:41:39,020
Oh no.

2753
02:41:39,340 --> 02:41:40,000
It's not me.

2754
02:41:40,260 --> 02:41:41,000
It's not me.

2755
02:41:41,500 --> 02:41:42,260
It's not me.

2756
02:41:43,280 --> 02:41:44,400
I'm sorry.

2757
02:41:45,660 --> 02:41:46,680
It's not me.

2758
02:41:47,140 --> 02:41:47,420
Oh.

2759
02:41:47,900 --> 02:41:48,260
It's okay.

2760
02:41:48,540 --> 02:41:50,060
We can DPS this then.

2761
02:41:51,800 --> 02:41:53,380
Because this is...

2762
02:41:53,380 --> 02:41:53,520
Oh.

2763
02:41:54,240 --> 02:41:54,600
Oh.

2764
02:41:55,180 --> 02:41:57,020
Oh my god!

2765
02:41:57,120 --> 02:41:58,000
There's too many!

2766
02:41:58,520 --> 02:42:00,080
Holy shit!

2767
02:42:03,000 --> 02:42:04,980
That's so many spiders!

2768
02:42:06,180 --> 02:42:07,010
Holy fuck!

2769
02:42:07,320 --> 02:42:08,080
What do we do?

2770
02:42:08,540 --> 02:42:09,840
What do we do?

2771
02:42:14,680 --> 02:42:16,640
It's just all spiders!

2772
02:42:19,760 --> 02:42:21,040
It's okay.

2773
02:42:22,400 --> 02:42:23,870
Holy shit!

2774
02:42:24,400 --> 02:42:25,580
It's just all spiders!

2775
02:42:31,590 --> 02:42:33,120
Oh my god, we're alive?

2776
02:42:33,900 --> 02:42:36,020
What the fuck?

2777
02:42:38,920 --> 02:42:40,620
We're alive?

2778
02:42:41,120 --> 02:42:42,860
Holy fuck, ow.

2779
02:42:44,760 --> 02:42:47,000
Wait, I'm gonna do something really risky.

2780
02:42:48,840 --> 02:42:51,320
No, I couldn't get it to work.

2781
02:42:54,830 --> 02:42:57,730
I don't know how the fuck we pulled that off.

2782
02:43:01,650 --> 02:43:04,670
I legitimately don't know how we pulled that off, not gonna lie.

2783
02:43:09,300 --> 02:43:11,480
Okay, 30 seconds.

2784
02:43:14,440 --> 02:43:16,040
Oh my god!

2785
02:43:21,380 --> 02:43:22,720
Captain America, please!

2786
02:43:23,540 --> 02:43:26,720
I'm trying to see where you are!

2787
02:43:31,340 --> 02:43:32,600
Holy shit!

2788
02:43:33,740 --> 02:43:34,440
Dance!

2789
02:43:38,450 --> 02:43:38,800
No!

2790
02:43:39,680 --> 02:43:41,040
Oh wait, I'm in all form.

2791
02:43:41,160 --> 02:43:41,720
It's fine.

2792
02:43:42,320 --> 02:43:44,680
Just as long as you guys are alive.

2793
02:43:47,420 --> 02:43:49,760
He just ate Captain America.

2794
02:43:50,220 --> 02:43:51,360
Sucks for him.

2795
02:43:52,040 --> 02:43:53,300
He ate Captain America.

2796
02:43:55,780 --> 02:43:57,200
Thank god.

2797
02:43:59,260 --> 02:44:02,040
Cap is playing like it's Marvel.

2798
02:44:02,380 --> 02:44:04,580
I forgot I was in all form.

2799
02:44:05,020 --> 02:44:08,920
I literally had like PTSD when I heard...

2800
02:44:10,240 --> 02:44:13,380
I went like full panic mode.

2801
02:44:15,900 --> 02:44:17,120
The fear.

2802
02:44:17,560 --> 02:44:23,140
Guys, after that one Jeff game, I can't... anything could happen.

2803
02:44:23,140 --> 02:44:25,240
Anything could fucking happen.

2804
02:44:30,680 --> 02:44:32,120
Yeah, PTSD.

2805
02:44:34,640 --> 02:44:37,360
Three penny alts, that's crazy!

2806
02:44:38,980 --> 02:44:42,260
Holy shit, how did we win the fight?

2807
02:44:42,940 --> 02:44:44,920
They literally had two penny alts.

2808
02:44:44,980 --> 02:44:46,260
How the fuck did we win?

2809
02:44:49,120 --> 02:44:53,660
That's post-traumatic shock disorder.

2810
02:44:55,920 --> 02:44:57,260
Jeff fear.

2811
02:44:59,060 --> 02:45:01,180
It's spidey time!

2812
02:45:02,120 --> 02:45:03,640
I legitimately don't know how we lived that.

2813
02:45:03,720 --> 02:45:04,980
We had no defense at all.

2814
02:45:06,020 --> 02:45:11,290
We just lived.

2815
02:45:11,970 --> 02:45:12,770
That's crazy.

2816
02:45:15,950 --> 02:45:17,510
Penny alt kinda doo-doo.

2817
02:45:17,810 --> 02:45:21,110
Honestly, I don't think I've ever died to a penny alt before.

2818
02:45:21,490 --> 02:45:22,990
I don't know.

2819
02:45:23,330 --> 02:45:25,370
I've yet to know what it actually does.

2820
02:45:26,010 --> 02:45:28,350
Yeah, I've already learned.

2821
02:45:30,990 --> 02:45:37,590
I remember when I... I remember when I... that was me.

2822
02:45:42,770 --> 02:45:48,310
I legitimately don't know because I feel like I've never like got hit by it, like died to it.

2823
02:45:50,710 --> 02:45:51,710
Oh nice.

2824
02:45:52,610 --> 02:45:54,390
Like, where do I look at?

2825
02:45:57,010 --> 02:45:58,630
Where do I look at?

2826
02:46:00,050 --> 02:46:01,890
Like, who do I look at?

2827
02:46:04,950 --> 02:46:07,970
Who do I... who do I kill?

2828
02:46:07,970 --> 02:46:08,230
Where do I go?

2829
02:46:12,390 --> 02:46:14,090
Alright, this is where I look at.

2830
02:46:15,050 --> 02:46:16,570
How did you guys get up top?

2831
02:46:18,570 --> 02:46:19,430
Oh, there we go.

2832
02:46:20,150 --> 02:46:20,470
Easy.

2833
02:46:20,810 --> 02:46:23,570
I'm like, everybody was like literally on their own.

2834
02:46:24,390 --> 02:46:31,630
Nobody was... I'm just like, everyone was just like in six different directions and I'm like, where do I go?

2835
02:46:32,050 --> 02:46:33,610
Where the fuck do I go?

2836
02:46:36,970 --> 02:46:37,490
Yay.

2837
02:46:42,350 --> 02:46:42,870
Nice.

2838
02:46:44,750 --> 02:46:46,270
Where the fuck is the other support?

2839
02:46:46,430 --> 02:46:49,370
Oh my god, they have three different supports because there's three different healers.

2840
02:46:50,590 --> 02:46:51,110
Nice.

2841
02:46:51,490 --> 02:46:51,890
Easy.

2842
02:46:55,190 --> 02:46:57,250
I'm plat 2, currently.

2843
02:46:57,850 --> 02:47:01,410
Plat 1 is... Plat 1 is top 500.

2844
02:47:02,270 --> 02:47:02,990
I'm plat 2.

2845
02:47:03,410 --> 02:47:04,770
Clap to win, guys.

2846
02:47:05,150 --> 02:47:05,250
Clap to win.

2847
02:47:05,270 --> 02:47:06,070
Clap to win.

2848
02:47:09,610 --> 02:47:11,430
Halfway there, we're halfway there!

2849
02:47:19,920 --> 02:47:21,640
Clap to win, just like Luna!

2850
02:47:23,000 --> 02:47:24,080
Clap to win!

2851
02:47:39,490 --> 02:47:40,830
I forgot I was muted a little bit.

2852
02:47:41,250 --> 02:47:42,830
I had to blow my nose.

2853
02:47:43,190 --> 02:47:45,270
No, no, they have a Luna icon.

2854
02:47:45,590 --> 02:47:47,150
No, don't do this to me!

2855
02:47:47,770 --> 02:47:49,650
Don't do this to me, I'm faster!

2856
02:47:54,530 --> 02:47:57,330
I see a Luna icon, I'm like...

2857
02:48:00,110 --> 02:48:02,010
Please, don't do this.

2858
02:48:02,570 --> 02:48:06,610
I've been... I don't think I've... I don't know, I think I only lost one game on Luna.

2859
02:48:08,390 --> 02:48:09,750
I'm gonna avoid this person.

2860
02:48:10,090 --> 02:48:11,990
They had a Luna icon, I know.

2861
02:48:14,170 --> 02:48:15,030
I know.

2862
02:48:20,250 --> 02:48:21,130
I'm faster.

2863
02:48:21,530 --> 02:48:23,730
It's like the Mercy insta-locks.

2864
02:48:27,150 --> 02:48:30,730
I can't believe we lost with a fucking streamer team, that's actually crazy.

2865
02:48:32,170 --> 02:48:34,610
What are they like, Luna?

2866
02:48:34,810 --> 02:48:35,310
You don't know.

2867
02:48:35,510 --> 02:48:38,570
It's like Mercy players that have their icon and banner and everything.

2868
02:48:38,790 --> 02:48:40,530
They make their whole personality Luna.

2869
02:48:45,030 --> 02:48:49,230
I can't believe... IT'S... IT'S AIM!

2870
02:48:49,690 --> 02:48:53,590
IT'S TECHNICALLY... IT'S TECHNICALLY NOT MERCY!

2871
02:48:53,730 --> 02:48:55,030
I AIM WITH HER!

2872
02:48:55,270 --> 02:48:56,970
I FUCKING SHIT ON TPS!

2873
02:48:57,590 --> 02:48:58,310
COME ON!

2874
02:49:02,740 --> 02:49:07,390
I FUCKING KILLED SO MANY TPS PLAYERS AS LUNA!

2875
02:49:09,590 --> 02:49:11,730
If anything, it's like Kuroko.

2876
02:49:12,050 --> 02:49:16,390
If you think about it, it's just that she's sort of like the Mercy of...

2877
02:49:18,150 --> 02:49:20,570
Oh my god, where the fuck are you, Margaret Robb?

2878
02:49:21,610 --> 02:49:22,390
Oh shit.

2879
02:49:23,230 --> 02:49:23,710
Thank you.

2880
02:49:24,650 --> 02:49:25,470
Oh my god.

2881
02:49:28,310 --> 02:49:30,530
I'm gonna do this, because it's just... the heals are just more...

2882
02:49:32,630 --> 02:49:33,110
WHAT?

2883
02:49:33,690 --> 02:49:33,950
NO!

2884
02:49:34,070 --> 02:49:35,590
I got Hawkeye'd!

2885
02:49:35,990 --> 02:49:36,910
Fuck, okay.

2886
02:49:37,310 --> 02:49:38,670
I got Hawkeye'd.

2887
02:49:39,490 --> 02:49:41,030
Oh no, he's so eepy.

2888
02:49:42,850 --> 02:49:43,330
Okay.

2889
02:49:45,010 --> 02:49:46,370
I got Hawkeye'd.

2890
02:49:46,550 --> 02:49:47,870
That made me so sad.

2891
02:49:51,310 --> 02:49:54,250
I need... I'm gonna stand... I'm gonna stand in the back.

2892
02:49:55,150 --> 02:49:56,970
I don't want that to happen to me again.

2893
02:49:59,630 --> 02:50:00,650
Oh god.

2894
02:50:01,190 --> 02:50:01,950
Oh god.

2895
02:50:02,850 --> 02:50:04,110
I'm so scared, Durst.

2896
02:50:04,830 --> 02:50:09,110
He's like... he's like shooting random logs.

2897
02:50:09,290 --> 02:50:10,230
I'm so scared, guys.

2898
02:50:13,990 --> 02:50:16,110
Someone... someone get him.

2899
02:50:17,790 --> 02:50:18,990
Oh my god!

2900
02:50:19,350 --> 02:50:20,250
Holy shit!

2901
02:50:29,260 --> 02:50:32,140
Oh my god.

2902
02:50:33,200 --> 02:50:33,960
No!

2903
02:50:34,320 --> 02:50:34,540
No!

2904
02:50:34,860 --> 02:50:35,260
Don't!

2905
02:50:40,020 --> 02:50:40,780
Please.

2906
02:50:41,020 --> 02:50:41,640
Please.

2907
02:50:43,520 --> 02:50:44,880
Please look at me!

2908
02:50:45,240 --> 02:50:45,960
Look at me!

2909
02:50:46,860 --> 02:50:47,440
Okay.

2910
02:50:55,580 --> 02:50:56,580
Holy shit!

2911
02:50:57,120 --> 02:50:57,620
Bro!

2912
02:50:59,280 --> 02:51:00,020
Look at me!

2913
02:51:00,200 --> 02:51:00,640
Look at me!

2914
02:51:00,800 --> 02:51:01,320
Look at me!

2915
02:51:01,560 --> 02:51:02,220
Look at me!

2916
02:51:06,360 --> 02:51:06,860
What?!

2917
02:51:06,860 --> 02:51:09,820
Oh no.

2918
02:51:12,040 --> 02:51:13,080
This is bad.

2919
02:51:13,440 --> 02:51:15,600
Guys, I think this is a team diff.

2920
02:51:16,200 --> 02:51:17,440
I think.

2921
02:51:18,020 --> 02:51:21,520
Guys, I have a feeling this might be a little team diff, guys.

2922
02:51:27,090 --> 02:51:28,530
Switch tank!

2923
02:51:32,670 --> 02:51:33,390
Fight!

2924
02:51:40,050 --> 02:51:41,970
Alright, I might ult this.

2925
02:51:42,870 --> 02:51:44,450
Oh, this is not good.

2926
02:51:46,070 --> 02:51:46,790
What?!

2927
02:51:46,790 --> 02:51:48,970
Oh, there's a fucking flanker!

2928
02:51:50,710 --> 02:51:51,910
I didn't even see him.

2929
02:51:53,510 --> 02:51:55,590
He ulted in front of me.

2930
02:51:56,250 --> 02:51:56,910
Fight!

2931
02:51:59,610 --> 02:52:00,810
I'm trying.

2932
02:52:01,290 --> 02:52:02,390
I'm trying so hard.

2933
02:52:02,910 --> 02:52:04,370
He's just like, fight!

2934
02:52:07,190 --> 02:52:08,490
Yo, Hela's scary.

2935
02:52:10,070 --> 02:52:12,430
And the thing is, they have Hela and Hawkeye.

2936
02:52:12,550 --> 02:52:15,730
So they have two, like, very heavy poke characters.

2937
02:52:16,190 --> 02:52:17,610
So it's very scary.

2938
02:52:18,790 --> 02:52:20,010
Like, right now.

2939
02:52:23,310 --> 02:52:25,610
Alright, here I go!

2940
02:52:26,290 --> 02:52:29,150
It's time to dance!

2941
02:52:30,110 --> 02:52:33,070
It's- Jesus Christ, okay.

2942
02:52:33,830 --> 02:52:37,990
Alright, it's dancing time!

2943
02:52:38,430 --> 02:52:40,430
Oh my god.

2944
02:52:41,350 --> 02:52:46,330
Oh my god, I- How long is that?!

2945
02:52:47,610 --> 02:52:48,710
It's time.

2946
02:52:49,590 --> 02:52:57,950
Guys, I have a feeling that, um, I think it's a team diff right there.

2947
02:53:00,250 --> 02:53:08,910
I have a feeling it's a- It might be a little- Woah!

2948
02:53:10,530 --> 02:53:14,070
It might be a little bit of a team diff.

2949
02:53:14,070 --> 02:53:16,710
Oh my god!

2950
02:53:16,990 --> 02:53:18,670
Bro, this guy's so bad!

2951
02:53:23,270 --> 02:53:23,990
Woah!

2952
02:53:27,710 --> 02:53:34,710
Let us- Let us mute this guy before he starts saying something crazy.

2953
02:53:35,010 --> 02:53:37,130
He's hitting that level already, guys.

2954
02:53:37,130 --> 02:53:46,030
He's hitting that level of, like- He's gonna- He's gonna say something really bad next time.

2955
02:53:46,290 --> 02:53:52,610
He's gonna- He's gonna- He's gonna say something really, really bad next game.

2956
02:54:02,540 --> 02:54:05,380
He was getting there, I could feel it.

2957
02:54:12,220 --> 02:54:12,620
Alright.

2958
02:54:12,620 --> 02:54:15,080
Yeah, I had a feeling that- You know what?

2959
02:54:15,200 --> 02:54:18,440
Maybe I can- I can- Yeah, I know how to look at his profile.

2960
02:54:18,620 --> 02:54:18,820
Okay.

2961
02:54:19,620 --> 02:54:20,840
Oh, I can look at it now.

2962
02:54:20,940 --> 02:54:22,800
I'll look at it after this game.

2963
02:54:23,440 --> 02:54:26,760
I wanna know his win rate on- Oh wait, he plays support.

2964
02:54:27,000 --> 02:54:28,800
Wait, he could've done this his entire time?

2965
02:54:29,760 --> 02:54:36,440
He could've- You're trying to tell me that he could've just played support this entire time?

2966
02:54:37,040 --> 02:54:37,900
I'm plat 2!

2967
02:54:39,000 --> 02:54:44,660
I just made it to plat 2, so like, I'm gonna lose a little- Some points now.

2968
02:54:46,980 --> 02:54:48,620
I already just made it to plat 2.

2969
02:54:54,670 --> 02:54:55,350
I'm scared.

2970
02:55:02,300 --> 02:55:03,380
I'm a little scared.

2971
02:55:04,100 --> 02:55:04,960
Not gonna lie.

2972
02:55:05,940 --> 02:55:07,140
I'm a little scared of the peak.

2973
02:55:11,980 --> 02:55:13,760
I'm very scared of the peak right now.

2974
02:55:13,880 --> 02:55:14,840
I feel like I'm gonna get logged.

2975
02:55:16,900 --> 02:55:18,840
I feel like I'm definitely gonna get logged.

2976
02:55:19,880 --> 02:55:23,260
I feel like they're looking to log me right now.

2977
02:55:25,140 --> 02:55:25,940
Woah!

2978
02:55:30,470 --> 02:55:32,410
I can get this real fast.

2979
02:55:34,150 --> 02:55:35,310
Oh, he's one!

2980
02:55:37,390 --> 02:55:38,190
Liv!

2981
02:55:38,730 --> 02:55:39,510
No!

2982
02:55:46,500 --> 02:55:47,300
Liv!

2983
02:55:50,160 --> 02:55:52,060
They're all trying to kill you!

2984
02:55:57,480 --> 02:55:59,000
Oh my god, I panicked.

2985
02:55:59,200 --> 02:56:00,160
I panicked.

2986
02:56:00,360 --> 02:56:01,860
I- I led my shot.

2987
02:56:03,100 --> 02:56:05,160
I could've killed the hell out of her!

2988
02:56:05,520 --> 02:56:05,520
I panicked!

2989
02:56:05,920 --> 02:56:08,420
She came out of nowhere and I choked!

2990
02:56:08,500 --> 02:56:09,900
My hands started shaking!

2991
02:56:13,560 --> 02:56:16,020
I was like, what the fuck are you doing here?!

2992
02:56:17,620 --> 02:56:19,180
The hell, I choked.

2993
02:56:19,340 --> 02:56:20,920
Yeah, she came out of fucking nowhere!

2994
02:56:22,300 --> 02:56:23,540
We're gonna win anyway.

2995
02:56:23,700 --> 02:56:27,040
We're definitely not gonna win that anyway.

2996
02:56:27,980 --> 02:56:29,220
Holy shit.

2997
02:56:29,900 --> 02:56:31,400
Okay, that's fine.

2998
02:56:31,980 --> 02:56:33,860
We got...

2999
02:56:33,860 --> 02:56:37,860
Okay, we're definitely gonna avoid him.

3000
02:56:38,300 --> 02:56:43,220
And then we're gonna avoid this guy because he was not having it.

3001
02:56:44,070 --> 02:56:46,280
He was... How do you have 433?

3002
02:56:46,660 --> 02:56:48,560
Yeah, this guy was definitely...

3003
02:56:51,840 --> 02:56:53,300
That's actually crazy.

3004
02:56:53,600 --> 02:56:58,520
This guy had like... was Mantis and only had 433 damage.

3005
02:56:58,800 --> 02:57:00,280
That's not good.

3006
02:57:00,640 --> 02:57:02,400
That's not good at all.

3007
02:57:02,660 --> 02:57:03,660
That's Mantis.

3008
02:57:03,800 --> 02:57:05,440
That's actually so bad.

3009
02:57:06,320 --> 02:57:10,100
Bro, the Irfuss had 1000 damage?!

3010
02:57:10,100 --> 02:57:11,480
No way!

3011
02:57:12,700 --> 02:57:14,580
No fucking way!

3012
02:57:16,560 --> 02:57:18,100
Oh my god.

3013
02:57:18,760 --> 02:57:19,160
Bro.

3014
02:57:19,460 --> 02:57:22,100
No, it was 100% a team diff.

3015
02:57:23,200 --> 02:57:25,320
It's a 0% accuracy.

3016
02:57:26,120 --> 02:57:27,980
This was definitely a team diff.

3017
02:57:34,940 --> 02:57:36,900
How the fuck did he get to plat like that?

3018
02:57:37,100 --> 02:57:38,880
They were just... Oh wait, we were playing against them.

3019
02:57:40,440 --> 02:57:42,380
Alright, we're playing against them now.

3020
02:57:43,780 --> 02:57:46,800
They have a good Storm player, by the way.

3021
02:57:47,060 --> 02:57:48,940
Oh, dude, Storm, I can shut him down so easy.

3022
02:57:49,680 --> 02:57:50,280
Oh shit.

3023
02:57:50,400 --> 02:57:50,620
Really?

3024
02:57:51,620 --> 02:57:56,840
Yeah, dude, Spider-Man, I mean, as long as it's not a closed off map, I can absolutely shit on Storm.

3025
02:57:57,880 --> 02:57:58,240
Really?

3026
02:57:58,840 --> 02:58:00,480
I'm trying to give you some damage boost, man.

3027
02:58:03,220 --> 02:58:04,840
He sounded so hopeful.

3028
02:58:05,460 --> 02:58:06,040
Yeah.

3029
02:58:07,740 --> 02:58:14,820
They were playing against a really, really fucking Gamer Hour Luna Snow.

3030
02:58:19,140 --> 02:58:21,380
Okay, they might lock in now.

3031
02:58:21,700 --> 02:58:24,040
Because they actually got some good players.

3032
02:58:26,200 --> 02:58:30,000
I do wish this comp... I mean, I guess we do have one team up on this comp, so it's not terrible.

3033
02:58:31,300 --> 02:58:31,660
Really?

3034
02:58:31,660 --> 02:58:32,320
Twirls hair?

3035
02:58:32,660 --> 02:58:34,280
Manny, thank you for the superchat.

3036
02:58:34,360 --> 02:58:35,380
Thank you, thank you.

3037
02:58:41,700 --> 02:58:42,720
What the fuck?

3038
02:58:44,740 --> 02:58:45,720
Wait, where is he?

3039
02:58:47,560 --> 02:58:50,300
Why is he not in the... Where is he?

3040
02:58:51,200 --> 02:58:52,280
Where's Iron Fist?

3041
02:58:54,800 --> 02:58:56,220
Where was he?

3042
02:58:56,520 --> 02:58:59,620
Where was he?

3043
02:59:03,160 --> 02:59:03,820
Wait,

3044
02:59:07,220 --> 02:59:07,980
how do I get up?

3045
02:59:08,580 --> 02:59:09,490
Okay, there you go.

3046
02:59:13,370 --> 02:59:15,270
Don't change, don't change, don't change.

3047
02:59:24,550 --> 02:59:29,290
Bro, bro, I'm trying so hard.

3048
02:59:31,670 --> 02:59:33,090
Yeah, no shit.

3049
02:59:35,910 --> 02:59:36,090
Bro.

3050
02:59:38,330 --> 02:59:43,530
Oh my god.

3051
02:59:46,730 --> 02:59:48,630
Bro, bro, I can't.

3052
02:59:48,770 --> 02:59:49,250
Wait, wait.

3053
02:59:54,830 --> 02:59:55,790
I'm sorry.

3054
02:59:56,610 --> 02:59:58,050
I'm so sorry.

3055
02:59:59,830 --> 03:00:00,990
Oh no, he's Grooting.

3056
03:00:13,930 --> 03:00:15,190
Says the Spider-Man.

3057
03:00:18,170 --> 03:00:21,070
Guys, we just need two tanks, guys.

3058
03:00:21,570 --> 03:00:22,910
Says the Spider-Man.

3059
03:00:26,750 --> 03:00:28,210
Guys, come on.

3060
03:00:29,130 --> 03:00:30,250
Come on, guys.

3061
03:00:30,730 --> 03:00:32,990
We just need two tanks, guys.

3062
03:00:35,470 --> 03:00:41,290
A true DPS player.

3063
03:00:44,610 --> 03:00:46,110
I'll do it.

3064
03:00:48,790 --> 03:00:49,450
Really?

3065
03:00:49,790 --> 03:00:51,350
A double support ult?

3066
03:00:51,410 --> 03:00:51,870
Really?

3067
03:00:55,310 --> 03:00:59,570
They're gonna use... I just hope we have the defensive ult for this.

3068
03:01:11,870 --> 03:01:13,190
You live!

3069
03:01:14,110 --> 03:01:16,510
You fucking live!

3070
03:01:16,930 --> 03:01:19,090
I clapped and you all live.

3071
03:01:19,670 --> 03:01:21,990
Guys, did you see how they line up for the clap?

3072
03:01:22,370 --> 03:01:25,810
Holy fuck, that was like the perfect lineup.

3073
03:01:25,810 --> 03:01:27,590
Oh my god.

3074
03:01:27,770 --> 03:01:29,690
It literally hit everybody.

3075
03:01:32,370 --> 03:01:34,950
Simple geometry right there.

3076
03:01:35,530 --> 03:01:37,830
I literally geometry'd that shit.

3077
03:01:40,690 --> 03:01:42,470
10 out of 10 clap.

3078
03:01:42,690 --> 03:01:47,270
I've only been clapping for four years now, so I hope so.

3079
03:01:47,590 --> 03:01:48,130
Oh god.

3080
03:01:48,370 --> 03:01:49,170
Oh god.

3081
03:01:49,430 --> 03:01:50,310
Oh god.

3082
03:01:50,710 --> 03:01:51,630
Oh god.

3083
03:01:52,290 --> 03:01:52,930
Guys!

3084
03:01:54,170 --> 03:01:55,450
Guys, please!

3085
03:01:56,070 --> 03:01:59,030
Where did my support duo go?

3086
03:01:59,310 --> 03:02:00,570
Oh, she died.

3087
03:02:00,990 --> 03:02:02,190
How the fuck did she die?

3088
03:02:04,110 --> 03:02:05,090
We got a mantis spawn.

3089
03:02:05,190 --> 03:02:05,610
Mantis spawn.

3090
03:02:05,750 --> 03:02:06,010
Mantis spawn.

3091
03:02:06,010 --> 03:02:06,190
Mantis spawn.

3092
03:02:06,750 --> 03:02:08,070
Okay, I'm coming back.

3093
03:02:09,850 --> 03:02:11,350
I got clapped hard.

3094
03:02:16,230 --> 03:02:17,010
Yikes, bro.

3095
03:02:17,210 --> 03:02:18,310
I killed Luna and Ironman.

3096
03:02:18,990 --> 03:02:19,990
I'm coming back.

3097
03:02:21,770 --> 03:02:22,410
Alright, okay.

3098
03:02:23,030 --> 03:02:24,370
I'm portaling above them to ult.

3099
03:02:25,310 --> 03:02:25,750
Alright, okay.

3100
03:02:26,810 --> 03:02:27,130
Alright.

3101
03:02:27,930 --> 03:02:28,470
Do you need damage?

3102
03:02:30,090 --> 03:02:30,910
I'll be here.

3103
03:02:35,470 --> 03:02:35,870
Nice.

3104
03:02:39,210 --> 03:02:40,010
We're in!

3105
03:02:40,310 --> 03:02:41,130
Oh my god.

3106
03:02:41,710 --> 03:02:43,110
That scared the shit out of me.

3107
03:02:43,190 --> 03:02:44,130
I thought I was gonna fall.

3108
03:02:51,810 --> 03:02:53,510
I don't think I need to ult this.

3109
03:02:56,570 --> 03:02:57,570
Yeah, that was a waste.

3110
03:02:57,570 --> 03:02:58,150
Portal above.

3111
03:02:59,230 --> 03:02:59,690
Portal above.

3112
03:03:01,250 --> 03:03:01,650
On him.

3113
03:03:01,710 --> 03:03:01,830
On him.

3114
03:03:01,930 --> 03:03:02,030
On him.

3115
03:03:03,690 --> 03:03:04,770
Nice, we got him.

3116
03:03:06,430 --> 03:03:08,210
What the fuck is this portal?

3117
03:03:09,810 --> 03:03:11,750
Now they're thinking we're portals.

3118
03:03:12,310 --> 03:03:14,150
What the fuck?

3119
03:03:15,670 --> 03:03:16,230
Okay.

3120
03:03:18,830 --> 03:03:19,530
Okay.

3121
03:03:25,190 --> 03:03:27,450
I'll give it to the Spider-Man.

3122
03:03:28,450 --> 03:03:30,290
The Spider-Man is like feeling it right now.

3123
03:03:32,000 --> 03:03:34,260
He's really feeling it right now.

3124
03:03:36,450 --> 03:03:37,850
I'm dancing!

3125
03:03:38,670 --> 03:03:39,590
Oh, fuck!

3126
03:03:41,310 --> 03:03:42,330
Where are you?

3127
03:03:46,230 --> 03:03:46,650
Yep.

3128
03:03:50,070 --> 03:03:53,290
Nice, he's still, he's still.

3129
03:03:53,730 --> 03:03:54,030
Nice.

3130
03:03:54,210 --> 03:03:54,850
Nice.

3131
03:03:56,730 --> 03:03:57,370
Go!

3132
03:04:00,270 --> 03:04:01,430
I'm gonna save ult.

3133
03:04:02,370 --> 03:04:02,610
Yep.

3134
03:04:03,090 --> 03:04:03,450
Nice.

3135
03:04:03,750 --> 03:04:04,370
We did it.

3136
03:04:04,670 --> 03:04:04,710
Good job, team.

3137
03:04:04,930 --> 03:04:05,870
Let's fucking go.

3138
03:04:08,190 --> 03:04:09,810
He's starting to believe.

3139
03:04:10,190 --> 03:04:11,410
He really is.

3140
03:04:11,410 --> 03:04:15,530
I still love the fact that, like, guys, guys, we need one more tank, guys.

3141
03:04:15,790 --> 03:04:17,910
Guys, we need one tank, guys.

3142
03:04:18,070 --> 03:04:20,090
That's the fucking Spider-Man player.

3143
03:04:24,890 --> 03:04:27,270
That's anybody but me, guys.

3144
03:04:35,990 --> 03:04:38,210
Except me, cause I'm Spider-Man.

3145
03:04:38,690 --> 03:04:40,730
I am Spider-Man.

3146
03:04:41,670 --> 03:04:46,770
Yeah, I think he, I think he, like, right-clicked me, and then shifted me, and then just headshot me.

3147
03:04:48,250 --> 03:04:50,470
350 damage burst combo, that's insane.

3148
03:04:50,590 --> 03:04:51,410
So cynical.

3149
03:04:51,670 --> 03:04:53,850
He's, he's popping off, though.

3150
03:04:54,530 --> 03:04:58,410
Spoken like a true one-trick, right, Dookie?

3151
03:04:58,570 --> 03:05:02,170
I mean, yeah, I think we just save portal for when we want to go in with ult is loaded.

3152
03:05:05,910 --> 03:05:09,430
Alright, he's him.

3153
03:05:12,750 --> 03:05:13,150
Alright.

3154
03:05:15,250 --> 03:05:15,890
It's okay.

3155
03:05:16,130 --> 03:05:17,050
I gave him the orb.

3156
03:05:17,190 --> 03:05:17,950
I'm sorry, Surefour.

3157
03:05:18,550 --> 03:05:21,230
But, like, I think he needs it more than you at this point.

3158
03:05:23,790 --> 03:05:26,310
Like, by the way he was playing there.

3159
03:05:30,030 --> 03:05:31,210
I don't think we should be falling.

3160
03:05:34,210 --> 03:05:34,610
Nice.

3161
03:05:38,550 --> 03:05:39,250
Let's go!

3162
03:05:42,090 --> 03:05:42,890
Oh god.

3163
03:05:43,770 --> 03:05:44,710
Oh my god.

3164
03:05:48,070 --> 03:05:49,550
It's okay, we're fine.

3165
03:05:51,890 --> 03:05:53,070
We're so healthy.

3166
03:05:54,890 --> 03:05:55,470
Wait, they're calling...

3167
03:05:55,470 --> 03:05:56,790
It's him!

3168
03:05:57,210 --> 03:05:57,670
It's him!

3169
03:05:58,050 --> 03:05:59,970
It's because I have his chat blocked!

3170
03:06:00,690 --> 03:06:01,550
It's him!

3171
03:06:01,770 --> 03:06:03,250
He's calling GG's again!

3172
03:06:03,910 --> 03:06:04,890
Oh my god.

3173
03:06:05,790 --> 03:06:07,150
That's, like, hilarious.

3174
03:06:07,870 --> 03:06:09,890
Oh my god, thank god I avoided him.

3175
03:06:09,890 --> 03:06:11,430
Free farm.

3176
03:06:11,550 --> 03:06:13,250
I hope I get to farm him again.

3177
03:06:17,350 --> 03:06:17,870
Sorry.

3178
03:06:22,750 --> 03:06:24,550
Sorry, Surefour, but you're not Spider-Man.

3179
03:06:24,670 --> 03:06:25,230
You're not him.

3180
03:06:25,970 --> 03:06:26,430
Sorry.

3181
03:06:27,590 --> 03:06:28,370
I had to.

3182
03:06:31,190 --> 03:06:33,070
What the fuck is going on, man?

3183
03:06:34,610 --> 03:06:37,050
Oh, yo, he's... he's alive?

3184
03:06:39,890 --> 03:06:40,890
Okay, I'm just...

3185
03:06:42,010 --> 03:06:42,270
Woah!

3186
03:06:43,030 --> 03:06:44,070
You're alive!

3187
03:06:45,130 --> 03:06:45,890
How did he...

3188
03:06:47,870 --> 03:06:49,090
Bruh, let's go!

3189
03:06:49,310 --> 03:06:50,730
We're fucking gamers!

3190
03:06:51,410 --> 03:06:54,070
He was not supposed to live.

3191
03:06:54,490 --> 03:06:58,010
But we Dr. Strange, we actually recreated Dr. Strange.

3192
03:06:58,490 --> 03:06:59,170
We...

3193
03:07:00,630 --> 03:07:02,390
We recreated the movie.

3194
03:07:05,090 --> 03:07:06,030
He came home.

3195
03:07:06,990 --> 03:07:07,930
Wait, Storm?

3196
03:07:09,610 --> 03:07:11,890
We literally recreated the movie there.

3197
03:07:13,090 --> 03:07:14,490
What an ult.

3198
03:07:15,450 --> 03:07:17,110
He changed the light.

3199
03:07:18,970 --> 03:07:20,630
Alright, I have ult here.

3200
03:07:20,650 --> 03:07:21,370
I'm gonna go behind them.

3201
03:07:21,490 --> 03:07:23,190
I'm gonna let you know when to damage boost me, okay?

3202
03:07:23,470 --> 03:07:24,030
I can see them.

3203
03:07:24,670 --> 03:07:25,330
Can you boost me now?

3204
03:07:25,890 --> 03:07:26,190
Right here?

3205
03:07:26,390 --> 03:07:26,670
Boosting.

3206
03:07:27,450 --> 03:07:27,610
Alright.

3207
03:07:28,450 --> 03:07:29,050
I'm getting dove.

3208
03:07:29,530 --> 03:07:29,890
I fell.

3209
03:07:30,790 --> 03:07:31,310
Wait, where?

3210
03:07:32,110 --> 03:07:33,530
Oh my god!

3211
03:07:33,650 --> 03:07:34,870
Please stand on me!

3212
03:07:36,030 --> 03:07:37,110
Okay, nice.

3213
03:07:39,310 --> 03:07:39,870
Okay.

3214
03:07:40,590 --> 03:07:41,730
I see a Venom.

3215
03:07:44,210 --> 03:07:44,770
Nice.

3216
03:07:45,430 --> 03:07:46,590
Oh my god, we did it!

3217
03:07:48,030 --> 03:07:48,590
What?!

3218
03:07:48,590 --> 03:07:50,110
Oh no, not again!

3219
03:07:50,470 --> 03:07:51,190
Oh no!

3220
03:07:51,430 --> 03:07:52,670
Oh no, he's coming for me!

3221
03:07:52,850 --> 03:07:53,670
He missed though!

3222
03:07:55,410 --> 03:07:56,150
I missed!

3223
03:07:58,310 --> 03:08:00,290
Oh my god, the team wins!

3224
03:08:03,530 --> 03:08:04,650
Looking easy.

3225
03:08:04,650 --> 03:08:06,790
Thank god we avoided him.

3226
03:08:07,590 --> 03:08:08,470
Thank god.

3227
03:08:09,870 --> 03:08:11,550
We avoided the enemy support.

3228
03:08:12,930 --> 03:08:13,770
I saw it!

3229
03:08:13,790 --> 03:08:15,350
The moment he went, he was gonna go gamer!

3230
03:08:15,830 --> 03:08:17,610
I was like, it's time to go.

3231
03:08:18,070 --> 03:08:19,210
You're out of here.

3232
03:08:19,770 --> 03:08:21,150
You're fucking out of my lobby.

3233
03:08:21,650 --> 03:08:22,110
Yeah!

3234
03:08:24,330 --> 03:08:25,630
We're so close!

3235
03:08:31,800 --> 03:08:32,720
Check his stats?

3236
03:08:32,820 --> 03:08:33,380
Oh yeah, you're right.

3237
03:08:34,320 --> 03:08:37,360
Okay, let's see if we can get it before our game queues up.

3238
03:08:40,800 --> 03:08:41,520
Uh...

3239
03:08:41,520 --> 03:08:42,100
History.

3240
03:08:43,400 --> 03:08:44,280
Like this, right?

3241
03:08:45,400 --> 03:08:46,940
Or is it view career?

3242
03:08:47,540 --> 03:08:48,900
He's plot one?!

3243
03:08:48,900 --> 03:08:51,000
He's top 500?!

3244
03:08:52,040 --> 03:08:52,760
How?!

3245
03:08:52,760 --> 03:08:54,540
Oh, is it because he's a one trick?

3246
03:08:55,040 --> 03:08:57,180
No, he plays...

3247
03:08:57,920 --> 03:08:59,000
Oh my god.

3248
03:09:00,320 --> 03:09:02,280
He's lost 30 plus games though.

3249
03:09:02,580 --> 03:09:03,420
No way!

3250
03:09:03,600 --> 03:09:05,500
He's higher elo than me?!

3251
03:09:06,100 --> 03:09:07,520
No fucking way!

3252
03:09:07,520 --> 03:09:09,620
Wait, what's my stats?

3253
03:09:10,400 --> 03:09:11,680
Oh, I can't see.

3254
03:09:15,720 --> 03:09:16,940
I'm gonna steal their spot.

3255
03:09:17,640 --> 03:09:18,820
I'm gonna take it.

3256
03:09:19,120 --> 03:09:20,940
I'm gonna fucking take your spot, man.

3257
03:09:31,880 --> 03:09:32,440
Okay.

3258
03:09:33,480 --> 03:09:34,860
I'm getting faster at locking her.

3259
03:09:35,540 --> 03:09:36,420
I'm kidding!

3260
03:09:37,500 --> 03:09:42,800
Not only am I getting better at Luna Snow, I'm getting faster at auto locking her.

3261
03:09:42,800 --> 03:09:45,200
I like, zone in.

3262
03:09:50,040 --> 03:09:51,280
It's muscle memory.

3263
03:09:51,460 --> 03:09:53,240
Yeah, I know exactly where it is now.

3264
03:09:55,380 --> 03:09:57,960
I gotta like, insta-scroll and everything.

3265
03:10:01,970 --> 03:10:02,490
Okay.

3266
03:10:03,150 --> 03:10:03,770
It's time.

3267
03:10:07,400 --> 03:10:10,780
What I'm happy about is that you lose less than you gain.

3268
03:10:11,040 --> 03:10:11,760
Which is great.

3269
03:10:11,980 --> 03:10:12,900
That's always a good thing.

3270
03:10:14,460 --> 03:10:15,500
Here's the orb.

3271
03:10:17,560 --> 03:10:20,400
I'm getting better at being a one-trick.

3272
03:10:21,300 --> 03:10:22,660
I think I'm gonna go for...

3273
03:10:22,660 --> 03:10:25,600
I'm gonna go for plat 1 and then I'm gonna call it.

3274
03:10:27,200 --> 03:10:29,160
Cause then I don't have to like, speedrun anymore.

3275
03:10:30,240 --> 03:10:32,960
I'm only speedrunning cause I wanna touch the leaderboard.

3276
03:10:33,160 --> 03:10:34,340
And just to be like, hey guys.

3277
03:10:34,920 --> 03:10:36,020
Look at me.

3278
03:10:44,580 --> 03:10:46,080
Or maybe I'll play like...

3279
03:10:46,080 --> 03:10:47,540
If I hit it, I'll play until I lose.

3280
03:10:48,120 --> 03:10:49,960
And then lose top 500, I guess.

3281
03:10:50,420 --> 03:10:52,580
What if I lose top 500 though?

3282
03:10:53,060 --> 03:10:54,560
Guys, what if I...

3283
03:10:58,260 --> 03:11:01,420
Guys, what if I lose it though?

3284
03:11:06,590 --> 03:11:07,050
Guys...

3285
03:11:07,050 --> 03:11:08,730
You can throw somebody?

3286
03:11:08,910 --> 03:11:10,530
Okay, I did not expect that.

3287
03:11:10,570 --> 03:11:11,190
Not gonna lie.

3288
03:11:11,770 --> 03:11:13,270
What the f...

3289
03:11:13,270 --> 03:11:14,830
Oh shit, sorry for laughing!

3290
03:11:15,330 --> 03:11:16,190
Oh my god!

3291
03:11:16,450 --> 03:11:17,610
I'm so sorry!

3292
03:11:18,210 --> 03:11:19,670
I should not have laughed!

3293
03:11:23,050 --> 03:11:24,290
Oh my god.

3294
03:11:24,710 --> 03:11:26,310
It was so funny in the moment.

3295
03:11:26,710 --> 03:11:27,270
You know what I'm saying?

3296
03:11:27,270 --> 03:11:29,710
It was so funny in the moment though.

3297
03:11:30,210 --> 03:11:31,270
It was so...

3298
03:11:31,790 --> 03:11:32,770
Oh shit.

3299
03:11:33,170 --> 03:11:35,550
It was like some FNAF jumpscare right there.

3300
03:11:36,510 --> 03:11:39,350
It was like legitimately a FNAF jumpscare.

3301
03:11:41,750 --> 03:11:44,110
It was so funny in the moment.

3302
03:11:44,250 --> 03:11:45,290
You don't understand.

3303
03:11:45,770 --> 03:11:48,270
It was so funny in the moment.

3304
03:11:50,490 --> 03:11:52,110
Oh my god, bro.

3305
03:11:52,210 --> 03:11:53,130
He's coming over!

3306
03:11:53,570 --> 03:11:55,310
He's coming over.

3307
03:11:55,410 --> 03:11:56,310
I'm so scared.

3308
03:11:59,490 --> 03:12:02,850
Look, he laughed and then all came over.

3309
03:12:03,350 --> 03:12:06,130
Bro, I didn't expect it!

3310
03:12:07,170 --> 03:12:08,610
Holy shit!

3311
03:12:08,690 --> 03:12:09,330
He's fucking...

3312
03:12:10,330 --> 03:12:11,450
You're crazy!

3313
03:12:13,110 --> 03:12:16,090
He just fucking jumps in like that.

3314
03:12:19,830 --> 03:12:21,950
You're fucking crazy.

3315
03:12:26,040 --> 03:12:27,940
Bro said hug you.

3316
03:12:28,380 --> 03:12:30,040
It was so funny though.

3317
03:12:30,620 --> 03:12:31,900
It was so funny.

3318
03:12:32,620 --> 03:12:33,900
Couldn't help it.

3319
03:12:34,440 --> 03:12:35,660
It was so funny.

3320
03:12:43,530 --> 03:12:44,790
The health is really good.

3321
03:12:44,930 --> 03:12:45,130
Yeah.

3322
03:12:45,710 --> 03:12:46,210
I agree.

3323
03:12:46,610 --> 03:12:47,990
That's why I'm not like peeking too much.

3324
03:12:50,370 --> 03:12:53,410
I don't know if I should use it defensively because like...

3325
03:13:00,410 --> 03:13:00,930
Liv...

3326
03:13:00,930 --> 03:13:02,450
Oh my...

3327
03:13:02,450 --> 03:13:06,030
How much damage are you taking?

3328
03:13:06,030 --> 03:13:10,810
How much

3329
03:13:16,590 --> 03:13:18,570
are you taking though?

3330
03:13:21,670 --> 03:13:22,830
Oh my god.

3331
03:13:22,970 --> 03:13:23,690
That's fucking...

3332
03:13:23,690 --> 03:13:24,670
Fuck, that's fucked.

3333
03:13:25,190 --> 03:13:26,250
She ulted the ult.

3334
03:13:28,470 --> 03:13:30,570
Guys, I think this is a team diff.

3335
03:13:31,230 --> 03:13:31,870
I...

3336
03:13:31,870 --> 03:13:33,550
Guys, I think...

3337
03:13:33,550 --> 03:13:35,750
I think this is a team diff right there.

3338
03:13:35,910 --> 03:13:36,270
I...

3339
03:13:36,730 --> 03:13:37,730
I don't know.

3340
03:13:41,810 --> 03:13:42,430
Oh my god.

3341
03:13:42,470 --> 03:13:43,170
He's coming over.

3342
03:13:43,550 --> 03:13:44,510
He's coming over.

3343
03:13:44,730 --> 03:13:46,030
I'm sorry for laughing.

3344
03:13:46,210 --> 03:13:48,510
I'll never laugh at you again.

3345
03:13:49,270 --> 03:13:50,170
Holy fuck.

3346
03:13:51,310 --> 03:13:52,050
Holy fuck.

3347
03:13:52,150 --> 03:13:52,530
He's coming.

3348
03:13:52,970 --> 03:13:54,190
I'm so sorry.

3349
03:13:58,210 --> 03:14:01,990
Ever since I laughed at him, it's never been the same.

3350
03:14:02,970 --> 03:14:06,350
It's been very scary.

3351
03:14:08,230 --> 03:14:10,190
The Hulk is so good.

3352
03:14:10,190 --> 03:14:12,870
Like, I think their Hulk and Hela are carrying.

3353
03:14:13,610 --> 03:14:14,130
For sure.

3354
03:14:23,150 --> 03:14:24,170
Oh my god.

3355
03:14:24,810 --> 03:14:25,090
Bro.

3356
03:14:25,650 --> 03:14:25,970
Bro.

3357
03:14:26,470 --> 03:14:27,030
Adam.

3358
03:14:27,450 --> 03:14:28,950
Adam, he's coming over.

3359
03:14:29,110 --> 03:14:29,250
Adam.

3360
03:14:29,610 --> 03:14:30,070
He's...

3361
03:14:30,070 --> 03:14:30,850
Oh, he's walked away.

3362
03:14:30,910 --> 03:14:31,570
He walked away.

3363
03:14:31,810 --> 03:14:32,730
Because he knows.

3364
03:14:32,750 --> 03:14:33,830
He knows we were scared.

3365
03:14:34,410 --> 03:14:36,030
He knows we were so scared.

3366
03:14:36,510 --> 03:14:36,830
Adam.

3367
03:14:37,470 --> 03:14:38,150
He knows.

3368
03:14:38,270 --> 03:14:40,270
He knows we're so scared of him.

3369
03:14:44,810 --> 03:14:46,510
Bro, somebody kill him.

3370
03:14:48,070 --> 03:14:50,070
This Hulk is really good, though.

3371
03:14:50,110 --> 03:14:50,690
Not gonna lie.

3372
03:14:52,630 --> 03:14:54,510
I think our tank is worse than...

3373
03:14:54,510 --> 03:14:57,110
Our tank is definitely not as good as theirs.

3374
03:15:01,190 --> 03:15:02,390
I mean...

3375
03:15:04,730 --> 03:15:06,070
I don't know what...

3376
03:15:07,890 --> 03:15:09,090
I mean...

3377
03:15:09,090 --> 03:15:10,270
Let's go.

3378
03:15:11,230 --> 03:15:11,990
We fight.

3379
03:15:13,630 --> 03:15:14,670
Wake up.

3380
03:15:15,410 --> 03:15:16,570
Bro, wake up.

3381
03:15:19,590 --> 03:15:22,970
Oh no, he's gonna smash now.

3382
03:15:29,280 --> 03:15:30,720
Oh shit, I didn't see her.

3383
03:15:30,860 --> 03:15:31,880
I didn't see her.

3384
03:15:34,100 --> 03:15:38,920
I was worrying about 300 other things going on in my fucking screen.

3385
03:15:40,560 --> 03:15:41,260
Oh god.

3386
03:15:44,120 --> 03:15:46,180
There were so many things going on.

3387
03:15:46,220 --> 03:15:48,480
I was scared about so many things.

3388
03:15:48,900 --> 03:15:49,640
You know...

3389
03:15:50,410 --> 03:15:54,300
I was so scared about so many things, guys.

3390
03:16:00,410 --> 03:16:01,190
No!

3391
03:16:02,750 --> 03:16:03,920
Why me?!

3392
03:16:04,570 --> 03:16:05,350
No!

3393
03:16:06,150 --> 03:16:06,810
Please!

3394
03:16:07,150 --> 03:16:07,650
Heal!

3395
03:16:07,990 --> 03:16:08,730
Just keep...

3396
03:16:08,730 --> 03:16:09,950
Beat him up, shark!

3397
03:16:10,070 --> 03:16:10,430
Please!

3398
03:16:13,790 --> 03:16:14,890
Oh my god.

3399
03:16:15,190 --> 03:16:15,650
No!

3400
03:16:16,230 --> 03:16:18,290
He didn't even kill the shark.

3401
03:16:19,690 --> 03:16:20,890
Oh my god.

3402
03:16:20,890 --> 03:16:21,090
Yay!

3403
03:16:27,670 --> 03:16:29,890
This is definitely a team diff, guys.

3404
03:16:32,990 --> 03:16:34,030
I can't...

3405
03:16:34,030 --> 03:16:35,830
I'm too scared to go up there.

3406
03:16:40,430 --> 03:16:40,950
No!

3407
03:16:43,590 --> 03:16:45,470
He hasn't died one single time!

3408
03:16:47,450 --> 03:16:49,190
I'm gonna avoid our Adam.

3409
03:16:49,550 --> 03:16:51,790
Adam is definitely not the character we need right now.

3410
03:16:53,610 --> 03:16:55,630
Also, our Groot is not that good.

3411
03:16:55,730 --> 03:16:57,830
He's getting tank diffed a lot.

3412
03:16:58,270 --> 03:17:00,610
I mean, he is getting hella tank diffed.

3413
03:17:03,910 --> 03:17:05,170
This is not it.

3414
03:17:05,330 --> 03:17:06,950
This is not the game, chat.

3415
03:17:11,060 --> 03:17:12,600
He's hulking all over us.

3416
03:17:16,500 --> 03:17:18,360
Oh, you know Surefour's giving up.

3417
03:17:19,580 --> 03:17:20,880
He's on the worst...

3418
03:17:20,880 --> 03:17:23,220
He's on the worst DPS possible.

3419
03:17:23,780 --> 03:17:25,420
He's just like, it's over.

3420
03:17:26,420 --> 03:17:27,700
It's so...

3421
03:17:28,360 --> 03:17:29,680
He's recreating...

3422
03:17:29,680 --> 03:17:32,080
He's recreating a comic book right now.

3423
03:17:34,480 --> 03:17:35,740
He's recreating...

3424
03:17:36,160 --> 03:17:37,940
He's recreating lore.

3425
03:17:43,060 --> 03:17:46,780
No, don't say that.

3426
03:17:46,820 --> 03:17:47,720
We were so close.

3427
03:17:48,260 --> 03:17:49,820
We were so close.

3428
03:17:50,780 --> 03:17:53,400
We literally needed like two to three wins.

3429
03:17:54,220 --> 03:17:56,280
Well, now we definitely need three wins.

3430
03:17:59,920 --> 03:18:01,000
Lore accurate.

3431
03:18:03,540 --> 03:18:05,080
Guys, no, you don't understand.

3432
03:18:06,220 --> 03:18:09,280
Wolverine is the worst DPS character.

3433
03:18:09,920 --> 03:18:10,660
Or duelist.

3434
03:18:13,800 --> 03:18:15,800
He's literally one of the worst ones.

3435
03:18:16,080 --> 03:18:17,420
Oh, our Groot has given up.

3436
03:18:18,780 --> 03:18:21,360
Our Groot was like, I ain't tanking this.

3437
03:18:23,560 --> 03:18:24,780
Okay, goodbye.

3438
03:18:27,160 --> 03:18:29,600
I don't think our Groot wants to tank this anymore.

3439
03:18:29,960 --> 03:18:32,380
I think he's like very done in general.

3440
03:18:33,020 --> 03:18:34,560
I'm pretty sure.

3441
03:18:35,320 --> 03:18:37,700
I'm pretty sure he's like...

3442
03:18:37,700 --> 03:18:39,980
He's like, bro, I ain't tanking.

3443
03:18:40,180 --> 03:18:41,740
Bro, he's left!

3444
03:18:42,360 --> 03:18:45,240
Oh my god, he's actually done.

3445
03:18:47,660 --> 03:18:50,500
He's just like, bro, I'm not tanking this.

3446
03:18:55,460 --> 03:18:56,480
Oh my god.

3447
03:18:57,380 --> 03:18:58,620
Oh, he's back.

3448
03:18:59,000 --> 03:19:00,160
Is he gonna play the game?

3449
03:19:00,500 --> 03:19:01,660
We'll find out.

3450
03:19:04,860 --> 03:19:06,420
Oh my god, please.

3451
03:19:07,560 --> 03:19:09,100
No, he is not back.

3452
03:19:09,240 --> 03:19:10,700
He is actually AFKing.

3453
03:19:11,820 --> 03:19:14,220
Oh, he's... oh yeah, game crashed.

3454
03:19:14,380 --> 03:19:16,320
Yeah, likely story.

3455
03:19:19,480 --> 03:19:22,280
Yeah, very likely story.

3456
03:19:22,280 --> 03:19:24,540
The game crashed.

3457
03:19:28,200 --> 03:19:29,680
Sure, buddy.

3458
03:19:32,420 --> 03:19:33,840
Just like that?

3459
03:19:39,500 --> 03:19:41,980
Okay, I'm gonna give it to like...

3460
03:19:41,980 --> 03:19:43,760
The one with the fleshies, cause...

3461
03:19:44,660 --> 03:19:45,520
Oh, what the fuck?

3462
03:19:45,920 --> 03:19:47,220
What the fuck?

3463
03:19:47,280 --> 03:19:48,560
Okay, I didn't see that.

3464
03:19:49,220 --> 03:19:50,700
Now's your chance, play.

3465
03:19:50,700 --> 03:19:50,780
Play.

3466
03:19:55,240 --> 03:19:59,460
I'm gonna avoid the Atom and the Groot.

3467
03:19:59,680 --> 03:20:02,000
I don't think your Atom is a good player in general.

3468
03:20:07,350 --> 03:20:08,510
Oh my god, there you go.

3469
03:20:09,510 --> 03:20:10,570
What the fuck?

3470
03:20:15,610 --> 03:20:17,510
Oh my god, he's recreating a movie!

3471
03:20:17,890 --> 03:20:19,750
He's recreating a movie right now!

3472
03:20:21,650 --> 03:20:22,970
Wait, we capped it?

3473
03:20:24,770 --> 03:20:25,150
Oh.

3474
03:20:25,950 --> 03:20:27,570
I'm gonna freeze him.

3475
03:20:27,730 --> 03:20:28,490
It does death thing.

3476
03:20:30,830 --> 03:20:32,290
Oh my god.

3477
03:20:32,590 --> 03:20:32,970
Wait.

3478
03:20:35,190 --> 03:20:36,510
Wait, we're here.

3479
03:20:37,170 --> 03:20:38,530
How did we cap this?

3480
03:20:39,210 --> 03:20:39,830
For real?

3481
03:20:41,990 --> 03:20:43,830
Avoid the Wolverine.

3482
03:20:47,710 --> 03:20:50,310
Wait, we actually capped it?

3483
03:20:51,290 --> 03:20:52,050
How?

3484
03:20:52,970 --> 03:20:54,650
One of them turned on their aimbot?

3485
03:20:58,040 --> 03:21:00,360
How the fuck did we cap it?

3486
03:21:01,540 --> 03:21:04,320
Is there- Oh my god, Hawkeye, are you okay?

3487
03:21:05,360 --> 03:21:06,020
Hawkeye!

3488
03:21:06,460 --> 03:21:07,740
Speak to me!

3489
03:21:08,600 --> 03:21:10,160
Holy shit, he lived!

3490
03:21:13,220 --> 03:21:14,300
He's Groot.

3491
03:21:14,860 --> 03:21:15,820
No, no.

3492
03:21:16,080 --> 03:21:16,780
Oh, thank god.

3493
03:21:19,740 --> 03:21:20,740
I'm trying!

3494
03:21:21,160 --> 03:21:21,680
Guys!

3495
03:21:21,680 --> 03:21:22,140
Jump!

3496
03:21:25,520 --> 03:21:26,720
I couldn't!

3497
03:21:27,020 --> 03:21:28,840
I swear, I tried!

3498
03:21:29,240 --> 03:21:30,260
I shot him!

3499
03:21:33,590 --> 03:21:35,330
I legitimately shot him!

3500
03:21:38,230 --> 03:21:40,550
He has no head, it's just a fin!

3501
03:21:40,890 --> 03:21:42,210
What do I do?

3502
03:21:42,590 --> 03:21:44,870
What do I do when it's just a fin?

3503
03:21:50,190 --> 03:21:51,910
This is Groot, guys.

3504
03:21:55,750 --> 03:21:56,870
We dance.

3505
03:21:57,670 --> 03:21:59,090
We fucking dance.

3506
03:21:59,250 --> 03:22:01,290
Groot, please, I can't heal you when I'm dancing.

3507
03:22:01,650 --> 03:22:03,270
We start dancing.

3508
03:22:03,930 --> 03:22:05,390
We start dancing!

3509
03:22:05,710 --> 03:22:07,090
Now they're gonna do the Psylocke ult.

3510
03:22:07,330 --> 03:22:07,810
I'm sorry.

3511
03:22:09,790 --> 03:22:11,750
I'm sorry they start- There it is.

3512
03:22:12,130 --> 03:22:12,950
I called it.

3513
03:22:13,210 --> 03:22:14,150
There it is.

3514
03:22:17,350 --> 03:22:18,230
There we go.

3515
03:22:19,690 --> 03:22:20,350
Groot, please!

3516
03:22:21,270 --> 03:22:21,690
Groot!

3517
03:22:22,150 --> 03:22:23,110
Just keep Grooting!

3518
03:22:24,110 --> 03:22:24,910
Just keep Grooting!

3519
03:22:29,250 --> 03:22:30,450
Just keep Grooting!

3520
03:22:30,630 --> 03:22:31,550
Oh my god!

3521
03:22:31,630 --> 03:22:34,750
I know that doesn't do jack shit, but like...

3522
03:22:35,910 --> 03:22:36,950
Oh my god.

3523
03:22:37,350 --> 03:22:38,110
How are we?

3524
03:22:38,910 --> 03:22:40,730
Oh my god, he's second raging!

3525
03:22:43,170 --> 03:22:44,190
Psylocke's so desperate.

3526
03:22:46,490 --> 03:22:47,290
You know what?

3527
03:22:47,310 --> 03:22:49,170
I'm proud of us for pushing this far.

3528
03:22:50,610 --> 03:22:51,750
We're doing it.

3529
03:22:53,290 --> 03:22:54,550
He can bleed.

3530
03:22:54,750 --> 03:22:55,490
Guys, the Hulk?

3531
03:22:55,610 --> 03:22:56,970
The Hulk can bleed.

3532
03:22:57,990 --> 03:22:59,390
He's not a god.

3533
03:23:00,910 --> 03:23:02,710
He can actually bleed, guys.

3534
03:23:04,630 --> 03:23:05,590
There's hope.

3535
03:23:06,270 --> 03:23:07,250
There's actual hope.

3536
03:23:10,110 --> 03:23:11,110
He's Grooting!

3537
03:23:13,350 --> 03:23:14,030
Dancing!

3538
03:23:15,190 --> 03:23:17,230
I'm dancing so hard!

3539
03:23:18,230 --> 03:23:18,750
No!

3540
03:23:18,910 --> 03:23:19,890
Oh wait, it's fine.

3541
03:23:19,890 --> 03:23:22,190
Oh, he's doing not fine, but...

3542
03:23:31,670 --> 03:23:32,650
It'll be okay.

3543
03:23:33,790 --> 03:23:35,770
It'll be so okay.

3544
03:23:36,610 --> 03:23:38,270
Oh my god.

3545
03:23:43,370 --> 03:23:46,690
I am trying to heal.

3546
03:23:48,430 --> 03:23:49,070
Please.

3547
03:23:49,790 --> 03:23:52,090
Please, I've never stopped healing.

3548
03:23:53,070 --> 03:23:55,110
Oh no, the big boy!

3549
03:23:55,550 --> 03:23:58,690
Oh, and he used a bubble so I can't do anything about it!

3550
03:24:04,210 --> 03:24:05,790
Are you okay?

3551
03:24:06,310 --> 03:24:07,190
Oh, you're okay.

3552
03:24:07,370 --> 03:24:07,850
You're okay.

3553
03:24:08,130 --> 03:24:08,690
You're okay.

3554
03:24:10,290 --> 03:24:11,310
He's fine.

3555
03:24:14,470 --> 03:24:15,430
He's fine.

3556
03:24:16,690 --> 03:24:18,750
Oh my god, we made it to the next checkpoint!

3557
03:24:20,750 --> 03:24:22,010
We made it!

3558
03:24:22,270 --> 03:24:23,410
We made it!

3559
03:24:24,150 --> 03:24:25,430
He took it like a champ.

3560
03:24:25,470 --> 03:24:26,210
He sure did.

3561
03:24:27,890 --> 03:24:29,070
Okay, that was a...

3562
03:24:29,070 --> 03:24:30,610
I think Adam's good at attack.

3563
03:24:30,710 --> 03:24:32,050
I don't know about defense, though.

3564
03:24:33,190 --> 03:24:34,910
Because now Adam's working for...

3565
03:24:37,390 --> 03:24:38,310
For attack.

3566
03:24:45,910 --> 03:24:49,370
Oh, I thought I got the...

3567
03:24:51,650 --> 03:24:52,590
Okay, guys.

3568
03:24:52,590 --> 03:24:53,690
Groot.

3569
03:24:54,130 --> 03:24:54,850
Oh!

3570
03:25:00,170 --> 03:25:03,190
I didn't even have to take one damage!

3571
03:25:09,040 --> 03:25:09,940
I'm coming back.

3572
03:25:14,860 --> 03:25:16,120
Wait, is he...

3573
03:25:17,080 --> 03:25:17,820
Is that...

3574
03:25:17,820 --> 03:25:19,080
Oh my god!

3575
03:25:19,140 --> 03:25:19,400
Yep.

3576
03:25:19,980 --> 03:25:20,340
Yep.

3577
03:25:21,580 --> 03:25:22,340
I'm gonna...

3578
03:25:22,340 --> 03:25:23,260
You guys can kill him.

3579
03:25:23,620 --> 03:25:24,900
I'm coming back, guys.

3580
03:25:28,040 --> 03:25:28,940
You're fine.

3581
03:25:30,120 --> 03:25:32,460
How the fuck did you guys live that long?

3582
03:25:37,430 --> 03:25:38,930
Oh my god, it's okay.

3583
03:25:39,850 --> 03:25:40,590
Put on a show!

3584
03:25:40,790 --> 03:25:41,330
Just attack!

3585
03:25:42,890 --> 03:25:43,850
Just keep fighting!

3586
03:25:46,210 --> 03:25:47,290
Just keep fighting!

3587
03:25:50,370 --> 03:25:51,470
Just keep fighting!

3588
03:25:53,330 --> 03:25:54,230
Oh, okay.

3589
03:25:54,310 --> 03:25:55,590
This is a little bad, though.

3590
03:25:55,650 --> 03:25:56,990
I don't know where I am.

3591
03:25:59,250 --> 03:25:59,730
I...

3592
03:25:59,730 --> 03:26:01,390
You think she knows I'm here?

3593
03:26:01,970 --> 03:26:03,190
You think she knows?

3594
03:26:04,990 --> 03:26:06,330
I'm sorry, Adam.

3595
03:26:06,390 --> 03:26:07,930
That was my hiding spot.

3596
03:26:09,930 --> 03:26:12,450
That was my hiding spot, Adam.

3597
03:26:13,410 --> 03:26:14,030
Only...

3598
03:26:14,030 --> 03:26:15,190
It's only one allowed.

3599
03:26:18,730 --> 03:26:21,090
Kodoki to go put on a show.

3600
03:26:21,930 --> 03:26:24,030
Oh my god, we capped it?

3601
03:26:28,610 --> 03:26:29,450
What?

3602
03:26:29,450 --> 03:26:32,710
Oh my god, we actually capped it?

3603
03:26:32,930 --> 03:26:34,130
That's crazy.

3604
03:26:34,390 --> 03:26:36,130
That's actually crazy.

3605
03:26:40,190 --> 03:26:40,910
Okay.

3606
03:26:41,610 --> 03:26:43,350
This is doable.

3607
03:26:43,770 --> 03:26:44,990
This is doable, chat.

3608
03:26:45,470 --> 03:26:46,530
This is so doable.

3609
03:26:50,360 --> 03:26:51,720
Oh my god.

3610
03:26:53,740 --> 03:26:56,280
Surefour on Wolverine is the play.

3611
03:26:57,320 --> 03:26:59,880
Don't underestimate Hulk and Wolverine.

3612
03:27:00,780 --> 03:27:02,140
Wait, he's also Canadian!

3613
03:27:02,380 --> 03:27:03,140
Wait, it fits!

3614
03:27:04,940 --> 03:27:07,060
Yeah, this is the new Marvel Watch game.

3615
03:27:07,140 --> 03:27:08,260
Um, mixed account.

3616
03:27:08,660 --> 03:27:09,380
Thank you for the super chat.

3617
03:27:09,480 --> 03:27:10,320
Thank you, thank you.

3618
03:27:13,000 --> 03:27:14,800
Oh my god, three minute defense.

3619
03:27:14,960 --> 03:27:16,520
Okay, we have a one minute attack, though.

3620
03:27:17,100 --> 03:27:19,560
But we also have three minute defense.

3621
03:27:21,720 --> 03:27:23,240
It all comes down to this.

3622
03:27:24,320 --> 03:27:26,980
I'll be very, very surprised if we win this.

3623
03:27:27,120 --> 03:27:28,120
Cause like...

3624
03:27:30,000 --> 03:27:33,020
The odds are very against us right now.

3625
03:27:33,380 --> 03:27:34,140
It's fun!

3626
03:27:34,600 --> 03:27:35,600
This game is very addicting.

3627
03:27:36,200 --> 03:27:38,560
I know a lot of people are getting super addicted to this game.

3628
03:27:40,520 --> 03:27:43,040
Cause it feels just like when Overwatch first came out.

3629
03:27:46,160 --> 03:27:49,040
And the games are like super competitive cause I'm in high elo.

3630
03:27:49,040 --> 03:27:50,200
So it looks...

3631
03:27:50,200 --> 03:27:53,300
So like, I trick you guys into thinking Marvel Rivals is this fun.

3632
03:27:53,540 --> 03:27:56,040
And then if you're like in the lower elo and...

3633
03:27:56,520 --> 03:27:59,180
You're like, why is it my game just like this?

3634
03:28:06,600 --> 03:28:08,440
Why are my teammates...

3635
03:28:08,440 --> 03:28:11,760
Why don't my teammates play like the teammates in Doki's games?

3636
03:28:17,950 --> 03:28:20,810
I don't think it was smart for them to go there.

3637
03:28:35,630 --> 03:28:36,590
Okay, nice.

3638
03:28:37,750 --> 03:28:38,330
Nice.

3639
03:28:47,680 --> 03:28:48,500
He's one.

3640
03:28:48,640 --> 03:28:48,960
No!

3641
03:28:49,200 --> 03:28:50,360
He was so low!

3642
03:28:54,360 --> 03:28:56,560
That Captain America was so low!

3643
03:28:57,960 --> 03:28:59,780
I almost got him too.

3644
03:29:00,700 --> 03:29:02,320
The only bad part is that I'm not charging.

3645
03:29:02,580 --> 03:29:04,660
I'm not getting support fast enough.

3646
03:29:05,260 --> 03:29:06,140
So like, I'm a little worried.

3647
03:29:08,900 --> 03:29:10,360
I'm a little worried about that.

3648
03:29:16,410 --> 03:29:17,230
Okay.

3649
03:29:22,960 --> 03:29:24,460
Oh my god!

3650
03:29:25,580 --> 03:29:26,960
That's Jeff!

3651
03:29:28,220 --> 03:29:30,820
I was like, where did he come from?

3652
03:29:32,060 --> 03:29:35,100
Holy shit!

3653
03:29:35,740 --> 03:29:36,480
Oh my god!

3654
03:29:37,080 --> 03:29:37,340
Bro!

3655
03:29:38,160 --> 03:29:39,390
Jeff came out fucking...

3656
03:29:42,740 --> 03:29:44,340
Holy shit!

3657
03:29:44,840 --> 03:29:45,670
That was crazy!

3658
03:29:46,860 --> 03:29:49,000
I saw him fucking kidnap!

3659
03:29:50,540 --> 03:29:51,680
No way!

3660
03:29:52,500 --> 03:29:53,140
I'm so crazy!

3661
03:29:53,600 --> 03:29:54,160
I'm kidding!

3662
03:29:55,520 --> 03:29:57,140
That was actually crazy.

3663
03:29:57,640 --> 03:29:59,040
Watching that kidnap.

3664
03:29:59,760 --> 03:30:00,280
Oh my god.

3665
03:30:00,360 --> 03:30:01,820
I'm not focused right now.

3666
03:30:01,940 --> 03:30:03,440
That shit was so funny.

3667
03:30:04,000 --> 03:30:07,240
That shit was so funny and I'm not focusing right now.

3668
03:30:10,160 --> 03:30:11,920
I'm shaking too much!

3669
03:30:17,760 --> 03:30:19,220
Oh my god!

3670
03:30:20,260 --> 03:30:21,800
That was so good.

3671
03:30:22,160 --> 03:30:24,240
I have to use it.

3672
03:30:25,620 --> 03:30:26,420
Okay.

3673
03:30:27,180 --> 03:30:28,420
Oh my god!

3674
03:30:28,560 --> 03:30:30,120
Goodbye everybody!

3675
03:30:32,080 --> 03:30:32,880
Goodbye!

3676
03:30:38,560 --> 03:30:39,700
Oh shit!

3677
03:30:41,200 --> 03:30:42,600
Wait, he fucked up!

3678
03:30:42,780 --> 03:30:43,820
Jeff fucked up!

3679
03:30:45,180 --> 03:30:46,300
Oh shit!

3680
03:30:46,400 --> 03:30:47,160
Goodbye Jeff!

3681
03:30:47,720 --> 03:30:48,200
Goodbye!

3682
03:30:50,240 --> 03:30:51,340
Oh my god!

3683
03:30:51,840 --> 03:30:52,300
Oh my god!

3684
03:30:52,920 --> 03:30:53,240
Adam!

3685
03:30:53,820 --> 03:30:54,780
Get over here!

3686
03:30:57,540 --> 03:30:59,260
Wait, we just all got off.

3687
03:30:59,500 --> 03:31:01,760
We all just got off the cart.

3688
03:31:04,580 --> 03:31:05,320
Guys, guys.

3689
03:31:05,420 --> 03:31:06,500
I can't feel you guys up there.

3690
03:31:13,040 --> 03:31:13,820
Oh my god.

3691
03:31:13,920 --> 03:31:14,660
Jeff is up there.

3692
03:31:20,520 --> 03:31:21,380
Oh god.

3693
03:31:21,600 --> 03:31:22,420
He's brute, guys.

3694
03:31:23,980 --> 03:31:24,980
Holy shit!

3695
03:31:25,520 --> 03:31:26,440
Every time!

3696
03:31:26,880 --> 03:31:27,440
He just...

3697
03:31:27,440 --> 03:31:28,740
That's so funny!

3698
03:31:29,080 --> 03:31:31,460
He just shows up next to me!

3699
03:31:32,130 --> 03:31:34,520
I'm just like, where did he come from?

3700
03:31:39,420 --> 03:31:41,140
Every time!

3701
03:31:41,680 --> 03:31:45,740
I just turn around and I'm like, he brings somebody over.

3702
03:31:46,440 --> 03:31:48,080
Oh my god.

3703
03:31:49,100 --> 03:31:50,790
They don't expect the...

3704
03:31:50,790 --> 03:31:53,970
I switch hella, dip that guy like three times and then he's fucking...

3705
03:31:59,690 --> 03:32:01,130
Holy shit!

3706
03:32:01,370 --> 03:32:02,690
What the fuck is he saying?

3707
03:32:02,850 --> 03:32:03,710
I am...

3708
03:32:03,710 --> 03:32:04,870
What the fuck?

3709
03:32:07,250 --> 03:32:08,430
I'm optic!

3710
03:32:10,390 --> 03:32:12,030
He really is!

3711
03:32:13,730 --> 03:32:15,790
Fucking Wolverine optic!

3712
03:32:22,570 --> 03:32:26,190
Bro, it's like a fucking Roadhog hook.

3713
03:32:34,900 --> 03:32:36,760
Wolverine wants to play all along, guys.

3714
03:32:36,840 --> 03:32:37,800
Who would've thought?

3715
03:32:38,380 --> 03:32:39,500
Bro, he does...

3716
03:32:41,280 --> 03:32:42,580
Wolverine wants to play all...

3717
03:32:42,580 --> 03:32:44,040
Wait, why are we in three supports?

3718
03:32:46,320 --> 03:32:48,020
Oh my god, we have Jeff now.

3719
03:32:51,960 --> 03:32:52,840
Who said...

3720
03:32:52,840 --> 03:32:54,980
Bro, he's literally the worst character.

3721
03:32:55,000 --> 03:32:56,580
I don't know how he's making it work.

3722
03:32:57,080 --> 03:32:58,020
Oh shit.

3723
03:32:58,420 --> 03:32:58,960
Oh shit.

3724
03:32:59,240 --> 03:33:00,060
I forgot to click confirm.

3725
03:33:01,040 --> 03:33:02,900
I don't know how he's making it work.

3726
03:33:03,060 --> 03:33:06,900
He's literally the worst character in this game.

3727
03:33:09,100 --> 03:33:11,010
His abilities fucking suck.

3728
03:33:17,590 --> 03:33:18,840
Oh my god, so much healing.

3729
03:33:20,260 --> 03:33:22,700
He's just like, I'm gonna learn Wolverine today.

3730
03:33:23,080 --> 03:33:25,900
And then ends up fucking killing everybody.

3731
03:33:30,170 --> 03:33:31,390
I am Groot.

3732
03:33:32,730 --> 03:33:34,010
Did you hear that?

3733
03:33:34,090 --> 03:33:34,790
He's Groot.

3734
03:33:40,320 --> 03:33:41,440
Guys, do you hear that?

3735
03:33:41,500 --> 03:33:41,900
He's Grooting.

3736
03:33:46,300 --> 03:33:47,600
Guys, he's Groot.

3737
03:33:48,660 --> 03:33:49,900
He's Groot!

3738
03:33:54,580 --> 03:33:57,520
I don't know how the fuck...

3739
03:34:01,480 --> 03:34:02,300
I'm Groot.

3740
03:34:02,560 --> 03:34:03,580
I am Groot.

3741
03:34:07,200 --> 03:34:08,960
I should eventually hit him, right?

3742
03:34:09,000 --> 03:34:10,820
There's like a clusterfuck of people there.

3743
03:34:12,320 --> 03:34:15,880
I'm just shooting in the general direction, hoping I hit something.

3744
03:34:17,040 --> 03:34:18,060
Oh no, oh no!

3745
03:34:18,160 --> 03:34:19,740
I had to reload at that time!

3746
03:34:20,660 --> 03:34:23,360
We had three healings and all of you guys had to reload!

3747
03:34:27,280 --> 03:34:27,650
Please.

3748
03:34:29,020 --> 03:34:29,480
Okay.

3749
03:34:34,620 --> 03:34:36,440
Guys, there's like a guy right here.

3750
03:34:36,600 --> 03:34:37,320
Guys, guys.

3751
03:34:44,030 --> 03:34:44,770
Guys!

3752
03:34:45,330 --> 03:34:45,690
Guys!

3753
03:34:49,530 --> 03:34:50,590
We're Grooting!

3754
03:34:51,850 --> 03:34:53,090
We're Groot!

3755
03:34:53,970 --> 03:34:55,210
Oh my god!

3756
03:34:55,390 --> 03:34:56,430
I'm sorry, goodbye!

3757
03:35:06,110 --> 03:35:07,250
I'm Groot.

3758
03:35:07,410 --> 03:35:08,190
I'm Groot.

3759
03:35:11,360 --> 03:35:12,440
I'm Groot!

3760
03:35:13,140 --> 03:35:14,240
I'm Groot!

3761
03:35:15,880 --> 03:35:16,940
I'm Groot!

3762
03:35:21,330 --> 03:35:22,690
Guys, no!

3763
03:35:23,170 --> 03:35:24,330
Groot, come back!

3764
03:35:26,850 --> 03:35:28,130
Holy shit!

3765
03:35:33,130 --> 03:35:35,050
We got it to like a minute though.

3766
03:35:35,730 --> 03:35:36,910
Like, that was a good defense.

3767
03:35:37,090 --> 03:35:39,390
I still don't know why we have Jakey on Sharkboy.

3768
03:35:40,550 --> 03:35:42,590
Jakey was doing so well as attack.

3769
03:35:43,210 --> 03:35:44,830
Wait, was Jakey on... wait.

3770
03:35:45,810 --> 03:35:48,170
Yeah, Jakey was doing really good as attack.

3771
03:35:48,330 --> 03:35:49,610
I don't know why he swapped off.

3772
03:35:54,350 --> 03:35:55,210
Oh my god.

3773
03:35:56,550 --> 03:35:58,990
I guess we can use it to get off point too.

3774
03:36:00,530 --> 03:36:03,030
But now we're so...

3775
03:36:04,370 --> 03:36:04,850
Okay.

3776
03:36:07,190 --> 03:36:07,670
Alright.

3777
03:36:08,610 --> 03:36:09,150
It's time.

3778
03:36:10,930 --> 03:36:12,210
It's time.

3779
03:36:12,210 --> 03:36:12,230
It's time.

3780
03:36:21,590 --> 03:36:22,430
He's Groot!

3781
03:36:24,170 --> 03:36:25,430
Oh shit!

3782
03:36:31,600 --> 03:36:33,040
Wait, that's not...

3783
03:36:34,760 --> 03:36:35,840
Oh no.

3784
03:36:36,140 --> 03:36:38,040
Wait, we lost that?!

3785
03:36:44,640 --> 03:36:46,440
Oh my god, please!

3786
03:36:47,780 --> 03:36:48,260
Please!

3787
03:36:49,440 --> 03:36:51,100
I'm sorry, Groot!

3788
03:36:51,220 --> 03:36:51,540
No!

3789
03:36:55,760 --> 03:36:56,760
How much is my ult?!

3790
03:36:58,840 --> 03:36:59,660
I have ult!

3791
03:36:59,720 --> 03:37:00,280
I have ult!

3792
03:37:02,500 --> 03:37:04,440
Oh my god, enemy team is locking in too.

3793
03:37:06,400 --> 03:37:08,320
Did we even use the Jett ult?!

3794
03:37:08,320 --> 03:37:09,760
What did you do with it?!

3795
03:37:12,950 --> 03:37:13,710
He's Groot.

3796
03:37:14,730 --> 03:37:15,210
No.

3797
03:37:18,730 --> 03:37:19,930
I have ult.

3798
03:37:22,370 --> 03:37:23,570
I have ult though.

3799
03:37:27,510 --> 03:37:28,350
Oh no.

3800
03:37:28,770 --> 03:37:29,630
Oh no.

3801
03:37:30,190 --> 03:37:31,050
Oh no.

3802
03:37:31,270 --> 03:37:32,830
They're all locking in.

3803
03:37:33,190 --> 03:37:35,650
I think the three support was a troll pick.

3804
03:37:36,570 --> 03:37:38,350
I legitimately think this is troll.

3805
03:37:41,510 --> 03:37:44,670
I think if we didn't run this...

3806
03:37:45,270 --> 03:37:46,650
Everything would've been fine.

3807
03:37:49,090 --> 03:37:50,330
I'm going in!

3808
03:37:58,720 --> 03:37:59,840
I am Groot!

3809
03:38:02,660 --> 03:38:03,860
Oh, it's not me.

3810
03:38:06,000 --> 03:38:08,280
No, my god!

3811
03:38:12,470 --> 03:38:14,690
The three support was troll!

3812
03:38:19,750 --> 03:38:23,670
It was troll, I swear!

3813
03:38:34,690 --> 03:38:37,090
Eat them!

3814
03:38:37,410 --> 03:38:37,930
Eat them!

3815
03:38:37,930 --> 03:38:41,170
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

3816
03:38:41,490 --> 03:38:42,230
Eat them!

3817
03:38:43,250 --> 03:38:44,750
Oh my god!

3818
03:38:45,290 --> 03:38:50,530
Oh my god, we won!

3819
03:38:50,910 --> 03:38:53,930
Holy shit, I can't believe we won that game!

3820
03:38:54,330 --> 03:38:55,730
Oh my god, he ate them!

3821
03:38:56,470 --> 03:38:58,990
Oh my god, go back to...

3822
03:38:58,990 --> 03:39:02,930
What the fuck does that even mean?!

3823
03:39:04,590 --> 03:39:06,430
I is Jett the MVP!

3824
03:39:07,230 --> 03:39:08,870
Oh my god!

3825
03:39:10,030 --> 03:39:11,350
Oh my god.

3826
03:39:11,650 --> 03:39:13,050
Bro, that was hell.

3827
03:39:16,450 --> 03:39:19,870
I kept everybody alive for so long.

3828
03:39:24,060 --> 03:39:25,860
Oh my god.

3829
03:39:26,920 --> 03:39:28,120
I literally...

3830
03:39:28,660 --> 03:39:29,840
I'm literally healthful.

3831
03:39:30,000 --> 03:39:32,420
I'm literally like medical care right now.

3832
03:39:35,840 --> 03:39:37,200
Oh my god.

3833
03:39:37,640 --> 03:39:38,480
That was crazy.

3834
03:39:38,560 --> 03:39:39,560
That was a crazy game.

3835
03:39:39,640 --> 03:39:40,860
I can't believe we won that game.

3836
03:39:40,920 --> 03:39:41,620
I'm gonna get water real...

3837
03:39:41,620 --> 03:39:42,140
Oh my gosh.

3838
03:39:42,220 --> 03:39:44,280
Okay, I'm gonna insta-lock and then get water real quick.

3839
03:39:44,740 --> 03:39:47,720
Yeah, I deserve like 50 points from that.

3840
03:39:49,060 --> 03:39:51,340
I'm better health care than Canada right now.

3841
03:39:57,850 --> 03:39:59,410
Oh my god, that was crazy.

3842
03:39:59,530 --> 03:40:01,190
That was a fucking crazy game.

3843
03:40:03,250 --> 03:40:04,050
What do we have?

3844
03:40:05,690 --> 03:40:06,650
Alright, I'm gonna get water.

3845
03:40:06,710 --> 03:40:07,170
I'll be right back.

3846
03:40:44,480 --> 03:40:47,620
As bad as things get, I try to stay positive.

3847
03:40:47,960 --> 03:40:49,420
30 seconds before you attack.

3848
03:40:49,740 --> 03:40:50,240
Get ready!

3849
03:40:51,300 --> 03:40:53,960
This could be the rank up game, but it doesn't guarantee top 500.

3850
03:40:54,400 --> 03:40:57,500
Chat, we don't know exactly where top 500 is in plat 1.

3851
03:40:57,780 --> 03:40:59,440
But this could be the rank up game.

3852
03:41:03,580 --> 03:41:05,020
Alright, here we go.

3853
03:41:08,440 --> 03:41:08,880
I still can't...

3854
03:41:08,880 --> 03:41:10,160
I can't believe Wolverine worked.

3855
03:41:10,340 --> 03:41:11,940
Like, that was fucking crazy.

3856
03:41:13,080 --> 03:41:15,600
That was actually fucking crazy.

3857
03:41:17,820 --> 03:41:20,480
All you need to do is capture the mission area.

3858
03:41:20,860 --> 03:41:21,280
Got it?

3859
03:41:22,580 --> 03:41:24,720
Is Luna still... No, I'm just a Luna one trick.

3860
03:41:25,760 --> 03:41:28,180
I sadly don't know how to play any other character.

3861
03:41:30,760 --> 03:41:32,120
Oh wait, they went behind.

3862
03:41:33,620 --> 03:41:35,640
Nope, no intel.

3863
03:41:36,120 --> 03:41:37,040
I didn't know that.

3864
03:41:38,500 --> 03:41:39,840
I didn't know they were on TP.

3865
03:41:40,100 --> 03:41:41,020
I was AFK!

3866
03:41:43,240 --> 03:41:44,660
No, not more Groot.

3867
03:41:45,320 --> 03:41:46,880
Oh no, I'm Groot!

3868
03:41:48,720 --> 03:41:49,920
I am Groot.

3869
03:41:54,000 --> 03:41:55,940
Oh my god, he's Grooting.

3870
03:42:01,660 --> 03:42:04,440
Jesus Christ, how much damage were you guys taking?

3871
03:42:06,080 --> 03:42:07,220
Calm down!

3872
03:42:09,180 --> 03:42:10,660
We're all Groot.

3873
03:42:11,960 --> 03:42:14,540
Warlock is good, but like...

3874
03:42:14,540 --> 03:42:17,880
He has the lack of... His heals are very limited.

3875
03:42:19,160 --> 03:42:21,080
Luna... I think Luna is better for sustainability.

3876
03:42:21,080 --> 03:42:25,920
I think it's Luna... I personally think after playing for this long...

3877
03:42:25,920 --> 03:42:29,200
I think it's Luna, Mantis, and Cloak and Dagger.

3878
03:42:30,180 --> 03:42:32,180
IMO, I feel like are...

3879
03:42:33,020 --> 03:42:34,080
Are the best healers.

3880
03:42:36,900 --> 03:42:40,060
Oh my god, it takes fucking forever!

3881
03:42:41,020 --> 03:42:42,220
To break the walls!

3882
03:42:44,640 --> 03:42:48,200
Like Mei... Mei is like... Mei walls are easier to break than this.

3883
03:42:48,340 --> 03:42:48,920
Oh, I have ult.

3884
03:42:49,120 --> 03:42:49,520
Let's go.

3885
03:42:49,520 --> 03:42:52,720
Let's go, let's fucking dance, everybody!

3886
03:42:53,040 --> 03:42:55,800
I'm ready to put on a fucking show!

3887
03:42:56,700 --> 03:42:57,240
Wow!

3888
03:42:58,940 --> 03:43:01,760
Let's take a... Yeah, baby!

3889
03:43:01,980 --> 03:43:02,880
Let's go!

3890
03:43:07,260 --> 03:43:08,700
Let's fucking go!

3891
03:43:08,840 --> 03:43:09,960
I got ult anyway.

3892
03:43:10,220 --> 03:43:12,060
Bro, get out of spawn!

3893
03:43:13,280 --> 03:43:15,580
Get out of spawn!

3894
03:43:16,640 --> 03:43:18,660
Okay, that's on you.

3895
03:43:22,700 --> 03:43:23,940
That's on you.

3896
03:43:24,120 --> 03:43:24,540
That's on you, honestly.

3897
03:43:25,220 --> 03:43:27,220
Like, you did not have to be there.

3898
03:43:33,580 --> 03:43:34,820
Oh no.

3899
03:43:35,480 --> 03:43:36,920
Oh no.

3900
03:43:39,260 --> 03:43:40,260
Oh no.

3901
03:43:40,880 --> 03:43:41,920
Goodbye, Groot.

3902
03:43:41,920 --> 03:43:43,580
Oh no!

3903
03:43:50,940 --> 03:43:53,000
I've always been a support main!

3904
03:43:53,140 --> 03:43:54,800
I was a support main in Overwatch!

3905
03:43:57,420 --> 03:44:00,160
He was feeling way too frisky there.

3906
03:44:04,500 --> 03:44:05,940
Oh my god, how the fuck?

3907
03:44:06,020 --> 03:44:06,740
Okay, I was gonna say.

3908
03:44:07,500 --> 03:44:09,240
How the fuck am I not hitting that?

3909
03:44:11,160 --> 03:44:12,200
Oh, okay.

3910
03:44:13,100 --> 03:44:15,620
I looked away for one second.

3911
03:44:19,060 --> 03:44:20,360
Why don't I Jeff?

3912
03:44:20,440 --> 03:44:22,280
Jeff is fucking situational.

3913
03:44:22,800 --> 03:44:24,440
This map is a terrible Jeff map.

3914
03:44:25,720 --> 03:44:26,440
For example.

3915
03:44:27,700 --> 03:44:31,180
And like, Luna Snow is just overall a better character.

3916
03:44:32,280 --> 03:44:35,180
Okay, I did not realize we were going high ground, but here we are.

3917
03:44:35,800 --> 03:44:37,260
Oh my god.

3918
03:44:37,980 --> 03:44:38,460
What?!

3919
03:44:40,020 --> 03:44:40,500
Again!

3920
03:44:41,280 --> 03:44:42,500
Don't again me, please!

3921
03:44:42,700 --> 03:44:43,800
No, he's gonna again!

3922
03:44:45,400 --> 03:44:46,720
Oh my god.

3923
03:44:50,200 --> 03:44:52,760
Oh my god, that scared the shit out of me.

3924
03:44:57,160 --> 03:44:57,640
Again!

3925
03:45:02,460 --> 03:45:03,800
I'm heading over, I'm heading over.

3926
03:45:03,900 --> 03:45:05,280
Please, please live.

3927
03:45:09,680 --> 03:45:10,160
Please.

3928
03:45:11,140 --> 03:45:13,340
Oh my god, I'm dancing too.

3929
03:45:13,900 --> 03:45:17,800
I'm putting a show just to start hitting.

3930
03:45:19,200 --> 03:45:21,460
Oh my god, shoot the turret!

3931
03:45:24,640 --> 03:45:26,580
Holy shit, you're alive.

3932
03:45:27,460 --> 03:45:29,300
Wait, Dr. Strange died?

3933
03:45:29,520 --> 03:45:29,860
How?

3934
03:45:34,520 --> 03:45:35,300
He's grooting.

3935
03:45:39,140 --> 03:45:39,600
Nice.

3936
03:45:40,140 --> 03:45:41,640
Time to dance.

3937
03:45:47,320 --> 03:45:48,440
Oh my god.

3938
03:45:48,880 --> 03:45:52,660
He was tanking all the alzheimer's like, Dr. Strange, what are you doing?

3939
03:45:53,120 --> 03:45:54,200
Don't be a hero!

3940
03:45:54,820 --> 03:45:57,200
Dr. Strange, get out of there!

3941
03:45:57,680 --> 03:46:00,240
We can't fucking fix you up a second time!

3942
03:46:03,000 --> 03:46:04,660
I mained Lucio at first.

3943
03:46:04,940 --> 03:46:06,700
And then Lucio went out of meta at one point.

3944
03:46:07,080 --> 03:46:09,080
I basically mained any character that was meta.

3945
03:46:09,940 --> 03:46:11,680
Back then in Overwatch, but right now.

3946
03:46:12,100 --> 03:46:15,000
But at that time, I learned every character as I was ranking up.

3947
03:46:15,220 --> 03:46:17,580
So I was able to play almost every character.

3948
03:46:18,420 --> 03:46:19,600
Every support character.

3949
03:46:20,200 --> 03:46:24,960
But I really enjoyed Luna in Marvel.

3950
03:46:25,400 --> 03:46:26,600
And Luna was there since Alpha.

3951
03:46:27,180 --> 03:46:31,220
So because Luna was there since Alpha, I occasionally played her the most.

3952
03:46:31,300 --> 03:46:33,200
So I had the most experience with her as a support.

3953
03:46:34,220 --> 03:46:40,180
So because of that, I went in too deep and I kept ranking up as Luna.

3954
03:46:40,820 --> 03:46:44,060
That it was too late for me to learn another support character.

3955
03:46:44,060 --> 03:46:47,240
It was way too late.

3956
03:46:47,680 --> 03:46:54,080
Because if I try to play a different character right now, it will not go so well.

3957
03:46:54,420 --> 03:46:55,800
If I try to play a different support.

3958
03:46:56,680 --> 03:47:01,560
Because I know my skill wise, I have a high skill.

3959
03:47:01,560 --> 03:47:03,060
I know that I'm good at...

3960
03:47:05,160 --> 03:47:08,480
Oh my god, I know that I'm good at Luna.

3961
03:47:09,260 --> 03:47:10,860
So I'm not too worried about it.

3962
03:47:10,860 --> 03:47:14,820
Jesus Christ, how did everybody fucking die?

3963
03:47:21,980 --> 03:47:24,820
Oh my god, I'm sorry.

3964
03:47:34,080 --> 03:47:35,030
Oh, okay.

3965
03:47:35,510 --> 03:47:38,510
I can't keep anybody up there.

3966
03:47:41,980 --> 03:47:44,380
Oh my god, you guys are fucking crazy.

3967
03:47:45,090 --> 03:47:46,890
You guys just went in there to die.

3968
03:47:49,290 --> 03:47:52,030
I'm so surprised we... oh my god.

3969
03:47:54,650 --> 03:47:56,070
That was not my fault.

3970
03:47:59,970 --> 03:48:02,870
Okay, let me make sure he doesn't die first.

3971
03:48:03,690 --> 03:48:06,170
Okay, you guys are gonna come up top.

3972
03:48:06,250 --> 03:48:08,750
I'm just gonna make sure this fucker doesn't fucking die.

3973
03:48:13,510 --> 03:48:14,030
Okay.

3974
03:48:16,630 --> 03:48:17,150
Nice.

3975
03:48:19,430 --> 03:48:20,550
Alright, that's scary.

3976
03:48:21,470 --> 03:48:22,170
Oh, he's dead.

3977
03:48:22,250 --> 03:48:22,470
Okay.

3978
03:48:23,030 --> 03:48:23,810
We go, we go.

3979
03:48:23,950 --> 03:48:24,490
He's dead.

3980
03:48:24,490 --> 03:48:25,050
He's dead.

3981
03:48:27,250 --> 03:48:27,590
Oh.

3982
03:48:31,250 --> 03:48:31,590
Nice.

3983
03:48:33,050 --> 03:48:33,810
Wait, me too.

3984
03:48:36,110 --> 03:48:38,310
I am also ready to put on a show.

3985
03:48:38,890 --> 03:48:39,530
Hey, me too.

3986
03:48:41,570 --> 03:48:42,250
Oh.

3987
03:48:42,770 --> 03:48:43,890
Oh my god.

3988
03:48:44,210 --> 03:48:44,550
Okay.

3989
03:48:46,290 --> 03:48:46,970
Okay.

3990
03:48:47,650 --> 03:48:51,290
Oh, guys, calm the fuck down.

3991
03:48:52,550 --> 03:48:53,230
Guys.

3992
03:48:54,490 --> 03:48:59,130
There can't all be... we gotta calm down with all the shows, guys.

3993
03:49:02,990 --> 03:49:06,050
Jesus Christ, how did I live through all of that?

3994
03:49:07,350 --> 03:49:09,070
Yeah, nobody dies.

3995
03:49:11,210 --> 03:49:14,390
That's like literally almost all their ults there.

3996
03:49:17,090 --> 03:49:17,970
We're fine.

3997
03:49:18,310 --> 03:49:18,990
We're still healthy.

3998
03:49:23,090 --> 03:49:23,730
Okay.

3999
03:49:26,210 --> 03:49:26,850
Okay.

4000
03:49:28,990 --> 03:49:30,670
We were almost all healthy.

4001
03:49:31,450 --> 03:49:33,230
We were almost there.

4002
03:49:34,910 --> 03:49:36,910
Oh my god, I froze him though.

4003
03:49:37,290 --> 03:49:38,690
Oh, that was a good freeze for me.

4004
03:49:40,010 --> 03:49:40,330
Oh.

4005
03:49:42,370 --> 03:49:43,590
Oh, no.

4006
03:49:43,870 --> 03:49:44,930
I'm sorry.

4007
03:49:49,030 --> 03:49:51,130
Go, Dr. Strange and Groot.

4008
03:49:51,830 --> 03:49:53,610
I'll keep you guys alive.

4009
03:49:55,510 --> 03:49:59,250
Jesus, it's only 40%?!

4010
03:49:59,250 --> 03:50:01,590
I feel like I've been...

4011
03:50:01,590 --> 03:50:05,370
Oh my god, I feel like we've been here for a while now.

4012
03:50:05,710 --> 03:50:09,310
I can't believe it's only at 40-50% now.

4013
03:50:10,050 --> 03:50:12,470
Oh my god, okay.

4014
03:50:13,350 --> 03:50:14,030
That's awkward.

4015
03:50:16,090 --> 03:50:17,350
That's really awkward.

4016
03:50:20,910 --> 03:50:21,670
Guys.

4017
03:50:22,530 --> 03:50:25,310
Guys, I'm ready to put on a show.

4018
03:50:27,770 --> 03:50:28,410
Guys.

4019
03:50:30,210 --> 03:50:31,810
Alright, goodbye guys.

4020
03:50:36,650 --> 03:50:37,490
Oh no.

4021
03:50:37,910 --> 03:50:38,890
Oh no, please.

4022
03:50:39,610 --> 03:50:40,010
Live.

4023
03:50:40,530 --> 03:50:41,570
Live, tanks.

4024
03:50:42,030 --> 03:50:44,210
Tanks, as long as you guys are alive.

4025
03:50:46,010 --> 03:50:47,830
The show must go on.

4026
03:50:52,480 --> 03:50:54,100
Don't let him do this to me!

4027
03:50:56,960 --> 03:50:57,480
Stop!

4028
03:50:58,040 --> 03:51:00,120
Holy shit, he's still chasing me.

4029
03:51:00,500 --> 03:51:01,680
What's wrong with you?

4030
03:51:04,180 --> 03:51:06,880
Oh my god, what's wrong with all of you?

4031
03:51:06,940 --> 03:51:08,780
Oh my god, that's so much damage.

4032
03:51:09,220 --> 03:51:10,420
Holy shit.

4033
03:51:13,040 --> 03:51:15,180
Okay, yeah, that, we were not living there.

4034
03:51:15,620 --> 03:51:18,060
We were not, that was targeted.

4035
03:51:23,030 --> 03:51:25,230
Holy shit, we're coming in with five ults.

4036
03:51:25,230 --> 03:51:29,450
Like, if we don't win this, this is like, we deserve to lose that round.

4037
03:51:30,550 --> 03:51:34,310
Like, we're literally coming in with like, six ults, five ults.

4038
03:51:35,230 --> 03:51:36,250
Alright, go in.

4039
03:51:38,150 --> 03:51:40,810
I like how he set up a turret there, he's like, this is it.

4040
03:51:51,730 --> 03:51:52,530
Okay, nice.

4041
03:51:56,090 --> 03:51:56,530
Nice.

4042
03:51:57,190 --> 03:51:59,010
We almost didn't stand on point.

4043
03:51:59,130 --> 03:52:00,970
That would have been so fucking bad.

4044
03:52:01,970 --> 03:52:04,930
Guys, you know what that means?

4045
03:52:05,070 --> 03:52:07,210
Let's put on a show!

4046
03:52:12,850 --> 03:52:16,950
Oh my god, almost C9.

4047
03:52:22,670 --> 03:52:23,550
Yeah!

4048
03:52:27,960 --> 03:52:30,380
Thank you, superchat, thank you, thank you.

4049
03:52:30,560 --> 03:52:33,260
Hey Toki, it's my birthday today and I thought I'd share something with you.

4050
03:52:33,320 --> 03:52:35,260
Thank you, superchat, thank you, thank you.

4051
03:52:35,360 --> 03:52:38,740
Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you.

4052
03:52:39,060 --> 03:52:40,820
Yeah, plot one!

4053
03:52:41,500 --> 03:52:46,300
We're better than 99.93% of people in the world!

4054
03:52:47,060 --> 03:52:48,000
Oh my god, look!

4055
03:52:49,960 --> 03:52:50,400
Yeah!

4056
03:52:52,200 --> 03:52:53,500
Happy birthday to...

4057
03:52:53,500 --> 03:52:53,900
No!

4058
03:52:53,900 --> 03:52:55,480
I couldn't check the link!

4059
03:52:56,140 --> 03:52:58,120
I wanted to check the link!

4060
03:52:58,660 --> 03:52:58,960
No!

4061
03:52:59,460 --> 03:53:00,560
I need to know!

4062
03:53:01,000 --> 03:53:04,140
I need to know how close I am.

4063
03:53:04,560 --> 03:53:07,040
Wait, I'm in diamond lobbies?

4064
03:53:07,740 --> 03:53:08,600
Oh no!

4065
03:53:09,280 --> 03:53:13,240
Happy birthday to you, happy birthday dear Nuh-uh.

4066
03:53:13,460 --> 03:53:15,020
Happy birthday to you.

4067
03:53:15,340 --> 03:53:15,740
Yeah!

4068
03:53:16,800 --> 03:53:19,320
I didn't even get a chance to look at my rank!

4069
03:53:19,800 --> 03:53:20,680
Wait, can I...

4070
03:53:20,680 --> 03:53:22,420
Can I look at my profile?

4071
03:53:22,420 --> 03:53:22,780
No!

4072
03:53:26,580 --> 03:53:29,420
Oh no, it's not fair!

4073
03:53:29,940 --> 03:53:32,320
I didn't get to look at my rank!

4074
03:53:34,060 --> 03:53:37,020
I need to know how close I am to...

4075
03:53:37,020 --> 03:53:40,320
I need to know how close I am to top 500!

4076
03:53:45,970 --> 03:53:47,650
I didn't check!

4077
03:53:50,110 --> 03:53:52,710
Guys, am I on the leaderboard, guys?

4078
03:53:53,270 --> 03:53:53,790
Guys!

4079
03:53:54,890 --> 03:54:01,350
Am I in the leaderboards, guys?

4080
03:54:06,670 --> 03:54:08,010
No, it was my fault.

4081
03:54:08,130 --> 03:54:14,290
Yeah, I wanted to show people that I'm better than 99.93% of the people playing this game.

4082
03:54:15,790 --> 03:54:18,190
Someone check if my name's on there!

4083
03:54:18,270 --> 03:54:20,830
And if it is, someone screenshot it!

4084
03:54:28,420 --> 03:54:30,620
Please, that's all I want to know.

4085
03:54:31,060 --> 03:54:32,900
What the fuck?

4086
03:54:33,080 --> 03:54:35,740
How do you have took damage already?

4087
03:54:40,360 --> 03:54:42,100
Like, how do I play this?

4088
03:54:48,480 --> 03:54:50,640
Oh my god, I'm gonna clap here.

4089
03:54:51,080 --> 03:54:53,320
Because everybody's lined up for clapping.

4090
03:54:56,280 --> 03:54:57,760
Oh my god, what are you doing?

4091
03:54:57,780 --> 03:54:58,560
You're crazy!

4092
03:55:01,740 --> 03:55:04,140
I'm on the leaderboard in our hearts.

4093
03:55:04,460 --> 03:55:08,040
But I need to know if I'm on the leaderboard in general!

4094
03:55:12,300 --> 03:55:13,620
No, I'm plat 1!

4095
03:55:16,580 --> 03:55:17,660
I made it to plat!

4096
03:55:19,980 --> 03:55:20,860
I'm plat 1.

4097
03:55:20,980 --> 03:55:22,900
Well, I was always plat, but I made it to plat 1.

4098
03:55:24,500 --> 03:55:24,920
Guys!

4099
03:55:25,520 --> 03:55:26,460
Guys, am I in it?

4100
03:55:29,560 --> 03:55:31,060
Guys, am I in it?

4101
03:55:31,200 --> 03:55:32,180
Yes or no?

4102
03:55:40,500 --> 03:55:40,900
No?

4103
03:55:42,400 --> 03:55:44,520
Okay, that means it's not over yet.

4104
03:55:45,240 --> 03:55:46,100
We gotta keep grinding.

4105
03:55:49,260 --> 03:55:50,800
Yeah, that means I gotta keep playing.

4106
03:55:51,900 --> 03:55:53,380
If it's not, if I'm not on it.

4107
03:55:53,520 --> 03:55:54,620
Oh my god, someone help me.

4108
03:55:56,000 --> 03:55:57,940
Alright, so we gotta keep playing anyway.

4109
03:55:58,200 --> 03:55:58,780
Thank god.

4110
03:56:00,780 --> 03:56:01,420
Oh yeah?

4111
03:56:01,880 --> 03:56:02,220
Wait, not yet.

4112
03:56:02,220 --> 03:56:03,660
I shouldn't put on a show yet.

4113
03:56:05,860 --> 03:56:07,440
Oh my god, woah!

4114
03:56:08,400 --> 03:56:09,740
Woah, I'm ready to put on a show too!

4115
03:56:09,780 --> 03:56:10,020
No!

4116
03:56:11,320 --> 03:56:13,640
I didn't expect him to insta-die!

4117
03:56:15,740 --> 03:56:16,380
Oh god.

4118
03:56:16,660 --> 03:56:17,680
Oh my god, you guys.

4119
03:56:19,080 --> 03:56:21,120
Oh my god, goodbye.

4120
03:56:24,800 --> 03:56:26,720
I did not expect him to insta-die there.

4121
03:56:30,250 --> 03:56:31,450
He still stopped the car.

4122
03:56:33,590 --> 03:56:35,570
What the fuck?

4123
03:56:36,410 --> 03:56:37,190
Oh my god.

4124
03:56:41,720 --> 03:56:42,160
Please.

4125
03:56:42,560 --> 03:56:43,340
No, he's one!

4126
03:56:43,500 --> 03:56:44,420
No, I couldn't press C!

4127
03:56:44,980 --> 03:56:46,640
Oh my god, I couldn't press C.

4128
03:56:46,740 --> 03:56:47,420
I'm so stupid.

4129
03:56:47,540 --> 03:56:49,920
I forgot that he's... I forgot he's Iron Fist.

4130
03:56:50,280 --> 03:56:51,720
If I pressed C, I could've lived.

4131
03:56:53,360 --> 03:56:55,340
I always need to remember to team up stuff.

4132
03:56:55,800 --> 03:56:57,620
I forget to team up stuff sometimes.

4133
03:57:01,510 --> 03:57:05,670
I need to remember that when I've teamed up, I need to press C on...

4134
03:57:05,670 --> 03:57:06,590
Woah!

4135
03:57:07,470 --> 03:57:09,950
Whoops, I did not think he would shoot me there.

4136
03:57:11,810 --> 03:57:16,530
Um, I can have like... I can heal myself and also have like a...

4137
03:57:16,530 --> 03:57:19,250
A thing that can skip dive targets off me.

4138
03:57:24,830 --> 03:57:26,230
Okay, you... I...

4139
03:57:29,530 --> 03:57:31,510
I can't keep you up forever.

4140
03:57:31,850 --> 03:57:34,230
Oh my god, I babysat...

4141
03:57:35,490 --> 03:57:37,910
I babysat him so hard.

4142
03:57:38,230 --> 03:57:39,710
Holy shit.

4143
03:57:43,480 --> 03:57:45,200
Oh my god.

4144
03:57:45,200 --> 03:57:48,860
That solo ult on our fucking other support.

4145
03:57:50,960 --> 03:57:54,100
Jesus Christ, I'm surprised she lived.

4146
03:57:58,720 --> 03:58:00,900
That shit was crazy.

4147
03:58:08,090 --> 03:58:09,370
Oh my god, he's...

4148
03:58:09,370 --> 03:58:11,790
I can't... I need you to kill him.

4149
03:58:11,890 --> 03:58:13,330
I need you to kill Groot.

4150
03:58:13,470 --> 03:58:15,630
I need you to kill Venom right now.

4151
03:58:15,970 --> 03:58:16,890
Oh no!

4152
03:58:18,770 --> 03:58:21,410
I honestly thought he was gonna kill him.

4153
03:58:22,810 --> 03:58:23,510
Oh, this is bad.

4154
03:58:26,410 --> 03:58:27,530
Oh no.

4155
03:58:29,510 --> 03:58:31,230
I legitimately thought he could do it.

4156
03:58:32,930 --> 03:58:34,770
I legitimately thought he could do it.

4157
03:58:38,250 --> 03:58:39,070
Oh nice.

4158
03:58:39,210 --> 03:58:40,050
Oh my god!

4159
03:58:40,050 --> 03:58:41,530
That ult was insane!

4160
03:58:42,590 --> 03:58:44,350
That was actually such a good ult.

4161
03:58:46,650 --> 03:58:48,810
The Psylocke ult was so good.

4162
03:58:50,410 --> 03:58:51,050
Nice.

4163
03:58:51,590 --> 03:58:51,930
Yeah!

4164
03:58:53,390 --> 03:58:55,530
Yeah, Psylocke popped off in the last round.

4165
03:58:59,870 --> 03:59:00,510
Hydrating.

4166
03:59:00,730 --> 03:59:01,230
Hydrating.

4167
03:59:05,230 --> 03:59:06,590
Who's ace right now?

4168
03:59:08,430 --> 03:59:08,750
Fire?

4169
03:59:09,070 --> 03:59:10,230
Oh, it's our Groot!

4170
03:59:11,090 --> 03:59:13,570
A really good Groot is so scary though.

4171
03:59:18,990 --> 03:59:20,210
Yeah, do I have a main yet?

4172
03:59:20,510 --> 03:59:23,730
If you watch this vibe, it's been four hours of Luna Snow.

4173
03:59:26,030 --> 03:59:27,070
Guys, I don't know yet.

4174
03:59:27,150 --> 03:59:28,310
I don't know what my main is.

4175
03:59:28,830 --> 03:59:33,490
I don't know what my main is, guys.

4176
03:59:34,070 --> 03:59:37,650
Four hours of Luna Snow and then like two minutes of Jeff.

4177
03:59:44,210 --> 03:59:47,830
There was Subzire and then like 30 seconds of Mantis.

4178
03:59:52,350 --> 03:59:53,350
Could be Jeff.

4179
03:59:53,390 --> 03:59:53,990
Who knows?

4180
03:59:54,630 --> 03:59:55,990
Remember when I used to be a Loki main?

4181
03:59:56,190 --> 03:59:57,410
Oh, those were the days.

4182
03:59:58,590 --> 04:00:00,030
Those were the days.

4183
04:00:01,150 --> 04:00:03,490
Yeah, I'm just trying to figure out what character I like so far.

4184
04:00:03,770 --> 04:00:05,730
I'm just trying to figure it out.

4185
04:00:10,720 --> 04:00:11,200
Woo!

4186
04:00:11,200 --> 04:00:11,320
Woo!

4187
04:00:16,860 --> 04:00:20,300
Yeah, if Loki had better heal output.

4188
04:00:21,240 --> 04:00:23,640
His heal output is so bad now.

4189
04:00:24,200 --> 04:00:26,280
Like he's just a DPS support.

4190
04:00:27,040 --> 04:00:29,020
Which is barely a support in general.

4191
04:00:33,100 --> 04:00:33,840
Jeez!

4192
04:00:37,390 --> 04:00:38,870
Poor Doctor Strange!

4193
04:00:39,270 --> 04:00:40,290
Holy shit!

4194
04:00:40,970 --> 04:00:42,010
That poor guy!

4195
04:00:42,670 --> 04:00:43,590
What the hell?

4196
04:00:47,900 --> 04:00:50,080
I'll just stay here on the cart.

4197
04:00:51,840 --> 04:00:52,520
Yippee!

4198
04:00:53,920 --> 04:00:55,560
I'm just- It's just like Lucio.

4199
04:00:56,300 --> 04:00:57,840
Feels just like Lucio.

4200
04:01:01,020 --> 04:01:03,720
Feels just like home, guys.

4201
04:01:04,040 --> 04:01:05,400
Just like home.

4202
04:01:12,010 --> 04:01:15,190
I gotta make sure the cart pushes fast enough.

4203
04:01:19,460 --> 04:01:20,420
Oh shit!

4204
04:01:20,700 --> 04:01:21,400
How the fuck?

4205
04:01:23,000 --> 04:01:23,960
How the fuck?!

4206
04:01:27,120 --> 04:01:28,600
Oh my god!

4207
04:01:29,060 --> 04:01:29,540
Goodbye!

4208
04:01:30,140 --> 04:01:31,020
Goodbye, Groot!

4209
04:01:31,840 --> 04:01:32,320
Groot!

4210
04:01:32,380 --> 04:01:33,120
Holy shit!

4211
04:01:33,200 --> 04:01:34,020
Go, Groot, go!

4212
04:01:35,340 --> 04:01:36,340
I don't think Groot's gonna live.

4213
04:01:36,440 --> 04:01:37,460
Okay, yeah, I was gonna say.

4214
04:01:37,880 --> 04:01:39,120
I was gonna say.

4215
04:01:39,440 --> 04:01:41,280
There's no way he lives that.

4216
04:01:45,750 --> 04:01:46,590
Surefour, I swear to god.

4217
04:01:46,670 --> 04:01:46,890
Surefour.

4218
04:01:46,890 --> 04:01:47,950
Peek me.

4219
04:01:48,190 --> 04:01:50,350
Peek me so I can give you your stupid orb.

4220
04:01:53,330 --> 04:01:54,630
Yeah, I almost have ult, though.

4221
04:01:55,830 --> 04:01:56,390
What?

4222
04:01:57,670 --> 04:01:58,230
What?

4223
04:01:58,370 --> 04:01:58,950
What happened?

4224
04:01:59,870 --> 04:02:01,510
What the fuck happened?

4225
04:02:06,370 --> 04:02:06,930
Oh!

4226
04:02:07,410 --> 04:02:07,910
Guys!

4227
04:02:08,690 --> 04:02:11,030
Guys, we just gotta stick together, guys!

4228
04:02:11,550 --> 04:02:13,170
Guys, I have ult!

4229
04:02:16,830 --> 04:02:19,150
Guys, I have ult!

4230
04:02:19,150 --> 04:02:20,390
Just gotta stick together.

4231
04:02:22,950 --> 04:02:24,130
Okay, I'm ready.

4232
04:02:24,290 --> 04:02:25,070
I'm gonna ult in.

4233
04:02:27,450 --> 04:02:28,110
It's Groot, guys!

4234
04:02:30,150 --> 04:02:31,710
Guys, did you guys know?

4235
04:02:32,170 --> 04:02:32,770
It's Groot!

4236
04:02:34,370 --> 04:02:34,990
It's Grootie!

4237
04:02:37,730 --> 04:02:38,870
It's Grootie!

4238
04:02:40,910 --> 04:02:42,370
Oh, she's gonna sidelock ult.

4239
04:02:43,170 --> 04:02:44,370
I can feel it.

4240
04:02:44,770 --> 04:02:45,870
Yep, there it is.

4241
04:02:47,870 --> 04:02:48,310
Nice.

4242
04:02:52,060 --> 04:02:52,500
Okay.

4243
04:02:54,940 --> 04:02:56,060
Oh my god, there he is!

4244
04:02:56,380 --> 04:02:57,400
Oh my god, there he is!

4245
04:03:05,660 --> 04:03:07,720
Holy shit, how much- I can't!

4246
04:03:07,720 --> 04:03:09,080
I cannot heal all this damage!

4247
04:03:10,580 --> 04:03:12,080
Oh my god, I cannot heal!

4248
04:03:19,440 --> 04:03:21,280
Jesus Christ, we have 60 seconds left.

4249
04:03:27,080 --> 04:03:30,920
We have 60- No, please, I have to reload.

4250
04:03:31,760 --> 04:03:32,220
No!

4251
04:03:36,180 --> 04:03:37,220
Oh my god.

4252
04:03:40,970 --> 04:03:41,570
Please.

4253
04:03:42,310 --> 04:03:43,210
This is the last fight.

4254
04:03:45,470 --> 04:03:47,110
This is actually the last fight.

4255
04:03:49,870 --> 04:03:51,010
I can, I can.

4256
04:03:51,110 --> 04:03:51,450
No!

4257
04:03:55,010 --> 04:03:56,010
Me too!

4258
04:03:56,690 --> 04:03:59,610
I'm putting on a show as well!

4259
04:04:01,910 --> 04:04:03,230
Please.

4260
04:04:03,790 --> 04:04:06,110
I can't put on a show forever!

4261
04:04:08,850 --> 04:04:09,850
Oh no.

4262
04:04:15,680 --> 04:04:17,000
Please.

4263
04:04:22,650 --> 04:04:23,970
No!

4264
04:04:24,870 --> 04:04:25,530
No!

4265
04:04:28,360 --> 04:04:31,280
We actually lose this?!

4266
04:04:31,280 --> 04:04:33,100
No way!

4267
04:04:35,820 --> 04:04:36,780
We trolled!

4268
04:04:37,120 --> 04:04:38,400
Oh my god!

4269
04:04:40,860 --> 04:04:42,280
We actually trolled!

4270
04:04:43,040 --> 04:04:44,900
I can't believe it!

4271
04:04:47,140 --> 04:04:48,560
Oh my god!

4272
04:04:50,140 --> 04:04:52,020
It's okay, I still stay in Plat 1.

4273
04:04:53,380 --> 04:04:54,000
I still stay.

4274
04:04:54,060 --> 04:04:58,440
We weren't- It's okay, we weren't in- We weren't in Top 500 yet anyway.

4275
04:04:58,580 --> 04:04:59,840
Guys, we weren't in Top 500.

4276
04:04:59,920 --> 04:05:00,700
See, look at that.

4277
04:05:00,700 --> 04:05:03,480
We weren't in Top 500 anyway.

4278
04:05:03,900 --> 04:05:04,640
It's okay.

4279
04:05:04,880 --> 04:05:05,840
It's okay.

4280
04:05:06,700 --> 04:05:07,960
It's okay.

4281
04:05:10,920 --> 04:05:12,400
It's okay, we still have a chance.

4282
04:05:13,660 --> 04:05:14,420
We're still a team.

4283
04:05:14,700 --> 04:05:16,540
Yeah, everybody was just like everywhere.

4284
04:05:16,720 --> 04:05:17,800
Nobody played together.

4285
04:05:19,060 --> 04:05:20,260
What is it?

4286
04:05:21,380 --> 04:05:21,800
Wait!

4287
04:05:22,120 --> 04:05:23,360
No, it's so close!

4288
04:05:23,940 --> 04:05:25,520
I'm so close!

4289
04:05:26,700 --> 04:05:28,640
Where is it?

4290
04:05:28,640 --> 04:05:31,820
Oh my god, I'm so close!

4291
04:05:33,120 --> 04:05:35,160
It's like right there!

4292
04:05:36,140 --> 04:05:37,940
It's right there!

4293
04:05:38,220 --> 04:05:40,100
Oh my god, it's almost close to Diamond.

4294
04:05:40,840 --> 04:05:42,160
Top 500 is almost Diamond.

4295
04:05:42,300 --> 04:05:43,320
It's like...

4296
04:05:43,320 --> 04:05:45,680
50 spots left in Plat 1.

4297
04:05:46,180 --> 04:05:47,300
Oh my god, please!

4298
04:05:50,240 --> 04:05:50,860
Please!

4299
04:05:51,980 --> 04:05:53,460
We're almost there!

4300
04:05:53,680 --> 04:05:54,960
We're almost there!

4301
04:06:01,700 --> 04:06:04,020
Please, I just want to be Top 500!

4302
04:06:04,840 --> 04:06:06,100
And then we can chill.

4303
04:06:07,560 --> 04:06:09,040
I think we might have won that game.

4304
04:06:09,180 --> 04:06:10,540
Yeah, we trolled that one.

4305
04:06:10,720 --> 04:06:13,100
Our team was like super split up.

4306
04:06:13,240 --> 04:06:15,820
And nobody played together in the end.

4307
04:06:17,200 --> 04:06:19,200
Everybody was like...

4308
04:06:21,420 --> 04:06:23,960
Everybody was just going in like by themselves.

4309
04:06:25,080 --> 04:06:26,260
Oh my god, we're so close though.

4310
04:06:26,380 --> 04:06:27,300
Like, it's literally...

4311
04:06:28,040 --> 04:06:29,540
I'm pretty sure he's in Top 500.

4312
04:06:29,720 --> 04:06:30,480
He's literally Diamond.

4313
04:06:30,760 --> 04:06:31,800
Oh, I was going to check.

4314
04:06:32,320 --> 04:06:33,380
I think he's Top 500.

4315
04:06:38,090 --> 04:06:39,130
Three-ish games?

4316
04:06:39,310 --> 04:06:39,870
How do you know?

4317
04:06:43,910 --> 04:06:44,550
Let's see.

4318
04:06:47,090 --> 04:06:48,370
I think Shuriblur's the only...

4319
04:06:48,370 --> 04:06:50,290
Oh no, there's another Diamond on the enemy team too.

4320
04:06:50,370 --> 04:06:52,070
This is a Plat Diamond lobby.

4321
04:06:56,310 --> 04:06:58,390
Oh my god, initial class!

4322
04:06:58,770 --> 04:07:01,270
No, Top 500 leaderboard is instant.

4323
04:07:02,070 --> 04:07:04,400
I know because so many friends...

4324
04:07:04,950 --> 04:07:06,810
The moment they get it, it's instant.

4325
04:07:07,550 --> 04:07:08,850
To be fair, two tiers?

4326
04:07:09,250 --> 04:07:12,570
From Plat 3 to Plat 1 in four hours?

4327
04:07:12,810 --> 04:07:14,030
I think it's pretty fast.

4328
04:07:14,450 --> 04:07:15,530
We only lost...

4329
04:07:16,210 --> 04:07:18,370
I don't even know what my record is.

4330
04:07:19,110 --> 04:07:21,490
What is my win to loss record?

4331
04:07:25,220 --> 04:07:26,080
Right now.

4332
04:07:32,370 --> 04:07:33,250
80 points?

4333
04:07:33,350 --> 04:07:34,270
Wait, how do you know that?

4334
04:07:34,270 --> 04:07:36,370
How do you know it's 80 points?

4335
04:07:45,810 --> 04:07:48,030
Wait, how do you know it's 80 points, chat?

4336
04:07:53,010 --> 04:07:54,030
Oh, were you there?

4337
04:07:58,030 --> 04:07:59,390
Source type main?

4338
04:07:59,830 --> 04:08:04,710
I don't know what the points are.

4339
04:08:09,330 --> 04:08:10,370
Oh wait, it's Storm.

4340
04:08:12,150 --> 04:08:14,470
Only have one DPS, this is a little scary.

4341
04:08:14,470 --> 04:08:15,670
And one tank, say.

4342
04:08:24,580 --> 04:08:25,300
Oh no, he's coming.

4343
04:08:26,020 --> 04:08:26,760
He's coming over.

4344
04:08:30,000 --> 04:08:30,660
Wait, what?

4345
04:08:31,880 --> 04:08:32,560
Wait, what?

4346
04:08:33,320 --> 04:08:34,260
You guys heard that, right?

4347
04:08:34,380 --> 04:08:34,800
Yeah.

4348
04:08:35,960 --> 04:08:37,340
Wait, you guys heard...

4349
04:08:40,770 --> 04:08:42,950
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god!

4350
04:08:42,950 --> 04:08:44,330
He's opening a portal, guys!

4351
04:08:44,490 --> 04:08:45,310
Oh my god!

4352
04:08:45,710 --> 04:08:49,370
Oh my god, he is opening up a portal, everybody!

4353
04:08:57,190 --> 04:08:59,730
Oh my god, I can't even get to my teammates.

4354
04:09:02,270 --> 04:09:02,710
Alright.

4355
04:09:04,310 --> 04:09:07,490
I heard, I'm opening up a portal, and I was like, where?

4356
04:09:12,290 --> 04:09:13,010
I'm okay.

4357
04:09:14,370 --> 04:09:15,430
I feel okay.

4358
04:09:16,230 --> 04:09:16,990
I don't though.

4359
04:09:18,170 --> 04:09:19,850
Yeah, that was a really good play by them.

4360
04:09:20,390 --> 04:09:22,050
He was definitely opening up a portal.

4361
04:09:26,610 --> 04:09:28,710
That was an incredibly good pick by them.

4362
04:09:31,070 --> 04:09:31,610
Come on.

4363
04:09:31,810 --> 04:09:32,650
I'm locked in, guys.

4364
04:09:32,750 --> 04:09:34,050
I'm gonna be super locked in now.

4365
04:09:37,520 --> 04:09:39,720
If I can heal and also do this.

4366
04:09:40,220 --> 04:09:41,000
Wait, where did he go?

4367
04:09:41,440 --> 04:09:41,620
Oh!

4368
04:09:43,220 --> 04:09:44,180
Jesus Christ!

4369
04:09:44,520 --> 04:09:45,000
I...

4370
04:09:45,000 --> 04:09:46,940
Bro, all we did was heal.

4371
04:09:51,520 --> 04:09:52,000
Please.

4372
04:09:52,320 --> 04:09:53,520
No, I...

4373
04:09:53,520 --> 04:09:54,940
I couldn't get the angle!

4374
04:09:57,880 --> 04:09:58,800
Oh no.

4375
04:10:01,020 --> 04:10:01,620
No!

4376
04:10:09,110 --> 04:10:10,430
Oh my god.

4377
04:10:11,810 --> 04:10:13,010
The angle...

4378
04:10:13,010 --> 04:10:17,390
Sure, her head was in a weird ass angle, so I couldn't get the headshot in.

4379
04:10:18,130 --> 04:10:20,650
The angle was so fucking weird.

4380
04:10:26,090 --> 04:10:27,590
It was a good freeze though.

4381
04:10:28,790 --> 04:10:31,070
At least the freeze was cool.

4382
04:10:34,650 --> 04:10:35,490
Okay.

4383
04:10:37,550 --> 04:10:38,250
It's fine.

4384
04:10:38,510 --> 04:10:39,030
Locked in.

4385
04:10:39,830 --> 04:10:40,350
Goodbye.

4386
04:10:41,270 --> 04:10:42,110
Goodbye.

4387
04:10:43,570 --> 04:10:44,610
Oh, thank god.

4388
04:10:47,610 --> 04:10:48,450
Alright.

4389
04:10:48,970 --> 04:10:51,150
I'm ready to put on a show now.

4390
04:10:51,570 --> 04:10:51,930
Yay!

4391
04:10:57,270 --> 04:10:58,110
Dancing!

4392
04:10:58,750 --> 04:11:00,150
And I leave nothing.

4393
04:11:00,410 --> 04:11:00,690
No!

4394
04:11:10,900 --> 04:11:11,580
Goodbye.

4395
04:11:14,660 --> 04:11:16,140
Good fucking bye.

4396
04:11:18,740 --> 04:11:20,100
That was...

4397
04:11:20,100 --> 04:11:20,900
A sad...

4398
04:11:20,900 --> 04:11:22,480
I think we have three support players.

4399
04:11:23,180 --> 04:11:25,220
Because why the fuck do we have Jeff?

4400
04:11:29,920 --> 04:11:32,060
Oh my god, please.

4401
04:11:33,120 --> 04:11:34,900
No, I still have like...

4402
04:11:34,900 --> 04:11:36,400
I think I can lose three.

4403
04:11:36,840 --> 04:11:38,340
This Venom is really good though.

4404
04:11:38,560 --> 04:11:39,940
This Venom is very annoying.

4405
04:11:40,920 --> 04:11:41,980
What the fuck?

4406
04:11:42,020 --> 04:11:42,980
He like dodged it?

4407
04:11:46,750 --> 04:11:47,350
Okay.

4408
04:11:49,650 --> 04:11:50,250
Nice.

4409
04:11:51,070 --> 04:11:51,670
Alright.

4410
04:11:53,230 --> 04:11:54,430
I'm locking in.

4411
04:11:56,670 --> 04:11:58,210
I'm so locked in.

4412
04:11:58,790 --> 04:12:00,470
I'm trying so hard right now.

4413
04:12:03,170 --> 04:12:04,130
You're gonna live.

4414
04:12:04,190 --> 04:12:05,130
You're gonna fucking live.

4415
04:12:07,170 --> 04:12:08,630
You're gonna fucking live.

4416
04:12:11,060 --> 04:12:13,190
He's gonna fucking do that thing.

4417
04:12:13,990 --> 04:12:15,570
Bro, this Venom is fucking...

4418
04:12:15,570 --> 04:12:17,330
Nobody has died!

4419
04:12:18,970 --> 04:12:22,050
No one has died on the enemy team!

4420
04:12:25,170 --> 04:12:25,830
Please!

4421
04:12:31,570 --> 04:12:32,560
Jesus Christ.

4422
04:12:35,310 --> 04:12:37,650
Please, all we do is heal you!

4423
04:12:37,930 --> 04:12:38,890
Oh my god, thank god.

4424
04:12:38,890 --> 04:12:41,370
Oh my god, some people actually died.

4425
04:12:41,690 --> 04:12:42,970
That's crazy.

4426
04:12:43,190 --> 04:12:44,510
We actually killed people.

4427
04:12:46,150 --> 04:12:47,350
That's insane.

4428
04:12:49,730 --> 04:12:51,390
We finally have kills.

4429
04:12:54,490 --> 04:12:55,170
Jesus.

4430
04:12:55,770 --> 04:12:56,350
Come on.

4431
04:12:59,210 --> 04:13:00,810
Yeah, but they have two supports.

4432
04:13:03,110 --> 04:13:04,290
Oh, that's true.

4433
04:13:04,410 --> 04:13:05,350
But like, you're right.

4434
04:13:05,350 --> 04:13:06,420
The two supports...

4435
04:13:07,010 --> 04:13:09,130
The three supports are just healing.

4436
04:13:09,750 --> 04:13:11,870
They're not actually, like, shooting things.

4437
04:13:16,320 --> 04:13:17,040
Oh my god, please.

4438
04:13:17,120 --> 04:13:17,660
I froze him.

4439
04:13:17,960 --> 04:13:18,300
Please.

4440
04:13:18,800 --> 04:13:19,800
You cannot die.

4441
04:13:23,040 --> 04:13:24,240
You don't die.

4442
04:13:24,680 --> 04:13:25,920
Oh, but you both...

4443
04:13:25,920 --> 04:13:26,620
You don't die.

4444
04:13:26,960 --> 04:13:27,840
You don't die.

4445
04:13:28,180 --> 04:13:30,980
You do not die until I tell you to die.

4446
04:13:31,440 --> 04:13:31,900
You...

4447
04:13:31,900 --> 04:13:34,000
Oh, get over here!

4448
04:13:34,260 --> 04:13:36,200
Get your ass over here, old man!

4449
04:13:36,940 --> 04:13:39,380
Get your ass over here!

4450
04:13:41,240 --> 04:13:41,800
Jesus.

4451
04:13:42,440 --> 04:13:43,680
I don't know how we lived there.

4452
04:13:44,360 --> 04:13:45,720
Oh my god, he just walked away.

4453
04:13:45,980 --> 04:13:50,420
He just walked away like that.

4454
04:13:54,900 --> 04:13:56,100
I froze somebody.

4455
04:14:00,660 --> 04:14:01,160
Nice.

4456
04:14:01,660 --> 04:14:02,520
The freezing worked.

4457
04:14:03,360 --> 04:14:05,020
That's good that I didn't get ulted too.

4458
04:14:07,200 --> 04:14:09,680
That was, like, the perfect time for me to not get ulted.

4459
04:14:10,760 --> 04:14:12,440
Because I saved the game with that.

4460
04:14:14,700 --> 04:14:17,240
The only bad thing is that my...

4461
04:14:17,240 --> 04:14:18,880
Because there's three of us.

4462
04:14:19,620 --> 04:14:20,120
Support ult.

4463
04:14:20,200 --> 04:14:22,140
Support ult's gonna take fucking forever to build.

4464
04:14:24,900 --> 04:14:26,820
Because we're all trying to build ult.

4465
04:14:26,920 --> 04:14:28,620
Please, I really need ult.

4466
04:14:29,300 --> 04:14:30,780
Please, I'm the most important.

4467
04:14:30,980 --> 04:14:32,200
I have a defensive ult.

4468
04:14:32,260 --> 04:14:33,560
None of you have defensive ult.

4469
04:14:33,560 --> 04:14:35,460
All your ults are aggressive.

4470
04:14:39,780 --> 04:14:41,460
Oh my god.

4471
04:14:42,240 --> 04:14:43,400
He's dead.

4472
04:14:47,420 --> 04:14:50,800
Oh, I don't have... I can't get it in time.

4473
04:14:54,260 --> 04:14:55,400
Frozen guy.

4474
04:14:56,560 --> 04:14:58,140
Oh, but she's dancing.

4475
04:14:59,800 --> 04:15:01,660
All she does is dance.

4476
04:15:04,520 --> 04:15:05,860
Please, I have to...

4477
04:15:05,860 --> 04:15:06,580
I can't.

4478
04:15:06,680 --> 04:15:07,740
I have to reload my hands.

4479
04:15:09,740 --> 04:15:11,640
My hands are reloading.

4480
04:15:14,930 --> 04:15:16,610
Jesus, fuck.

4481
04:15:16,710 --> 04:15:17,990
This fight is forever.

4482
04:15:26,760 --> 04:15:29,880
Oh my god, they're...

4483
04:15:29,880 --> 04:15:31,700
Please, she's one HP.

4484
04:15:33,620 --> 04:15:34,280
Good stuff.

4485
04:15:34,460 --> 04:15:34,860
Good job.

4486
04:15:35,620 --> 04:15:38,120
Okay, nice, we got her.

4487
04:15:38,560 --> 04:15:39,960
We have to heal.

4488
04:15:40,740 --> 04:15:42,320
Oh, I have it.

4489
04:15:43,340 --> 04:15:44,120
I have ult now.

4490
04:15:46,460 --> 04:15:50,340
They're gonna have Dr. Stringjolt, so I'm gonna have to be very far away from them.

4491
04:15:51,280 --> 04:15:52,120
I can feel it.

4492
04:15:57,940 --> 04:15:58,980
Oh, that's ours.

4493
04:15:59,100 --> 04:15:59,480
That's ours.

4494
04:15:59,480 --> 04:16:03,040
I was like... I didn't even realize.

4495
04:16:04,580 --> 04:16:05,340
That's okay!

4496
04:16:06,360 --> 04:16:08,660
Because I can predict all...

4497
04:16:08,660 --> 04:16:11,400
Because I came from Overwatch, baby!

4498
04:16:12,400 --> 04:16:14,860
I know how to count ult charge!

4499
04:16:16,040 --> 04:16:17,620
That's fucking right!

4500
04:16:17,680 --> 04:16:18,440
Oh, shit.

4501
04:16:19,500 --> 04:16:20,480
Oh, this is bad now.

4502
04:16:24,460 --> 04:16:27,220
That's actually right, I came from Overwatch, so I'm...

4503
04:16:27,220 --> 04:16:28,660
Oh, this is very bad now.

4504
04:16:29,140 --> 04:16:30,560
Oh, my god.

4505
04:16:30,660 --> 04:16:33,020
This is a lot of damage.

4506
04:16:35,820 --> 04:16:36,520
Good luck.

4507
04:16:37,280 --> 04:16:38,260
Good luck, Magneto.

4508
04:16:38,400 --> 04:16:39,500
That is a lot of damage.

4509
04:16:39,580 --> 04:16:40,380
Good fucking luck.

4510
04:16:45,270 --> 04:16:46,070
Jesus Christ.

4511
04:16:47,450 --> 04:16:47,850
Oh.

4512
04:16:49,570 --> 04:16:50,550
I think Magneto might die here.

4513
04:16:51,270 --> 04:16:52,010
I am!

4514
04:16:52,530 --> 04:16:54,310
That's way too much.

4515
04:16:55,930 --> 04:16:56,330
No!

4516
04:16:56,590 --> 04:16:57,230
I could've killed her!

4517
04:16:57,270 --> 04:16:57,830
I could've killed her!

4518
04:16:58,190 --> 04:16:58,850
Oh, shit.

4519
04:16:58,910 --> 04:16:59,970
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

4520
04:16:59,970 --> 04:17:02,470
I have to be in here.

4521
04:17:06,890 --> 04:17:08,690
Oh, I had to get on!

4522
04:17:11,030 --> 04:17:12,530
Guys, get on the point!

4523
04:17:12,810 --> 04:17:13,710
Oh, my god, okay.

4524
04:17:15,270 --> 04:17:17,370
Why am I the one getting on point?

4525
04:17:20,450 --> 04:17:21,650
Guys, just stay on point, guys.

4526
04:17:21,750 --> 04:17:22,510
Just stay on point.

4527
04:17:22,870 --> 04:17:23,710
Oh, they got off.

4528
04:17:24,290 --> 04:17:25,030
No, he doesn't.

4529
04:17:25,030 --> 04:17:25,970
He doesn't.

4530
04:17:27,550 --> 04:17:28,070
Oh,

4531
04:17:31,510 --> 04:17:32,570
my god.

4532
04:17:33,770 --> 04:17:35,530
That was a crazy game.

4533
04:17:40,070 --> 04:17:41,250
That was such a crazy game.

4534
04:17:42,650 --> 04:17:44,490
Oh, that was way too close for comfort.

4535
04:17:44,710 --> 04:17:45,290
It was.

4536
04:17:45,610 --> 04:17:46,430
How did we...

4537
04:17:46,430 --> 04:17:48,410
All my friends kept telling me that...

4538
04:17:48,410 --> 04:17:50,870
Like, all my DPS friends kept telling me, like...

4539
04:17:50,870 --> 04:17:53,110
Oh, my god, everybody keeps picking DPS.

4540
04:17:53,110 --> 04:17:57,430
How come when I queue, everybody keeps picking support?

4541
04:17:58,110 --> 04:17:58,310
Like...

4542
04:17:59,650 --> 04:18:02,810
Like, where are my DPS players?

4543
04:18:09,390 --> 04:18:10,310
Like...

4544
04:18:10,310 --> 04:18:11,890
I don't understand!

4545
04:18:11,890 --> 04:18:12,450
I don't understand!

4546
04:18:19,620 --> 04:18:20,810
Everyone tells, like...

4547
04:18:20,810 --> 04:18:22,590
My DPS friends, they're like...

4548
04:18:22,590 --> 04:18:25,690
You have to fill out support because everybody wants to play DPS.

4549
04:18:25,850 --> 04:18:27,090
And I'm like...

4550
04:18:27,090 --> 04:18:29,270
Everybody wants to play support in my lobbies!

4551
04:18:29,910 --> 04:18:31,830
We don't get DPS players!

4552
04:18:32,510 --> 04:18:35,130
I'm just lucky enough that ShortForce is a DPS player.

4553
04:18:45,290 --> 04:18:45,850
Yay!

4554
04:18:48,670 --> 04:18:49,630
TP left.

4555
04:18:50,630 --> 04:18:51,530
Alright, TP.

4556
04:18:52,790 --> 04:18:53,350
Alright.

4557
04:18:53,490 --> 04:18:54,470
Oh, we're gonna do that thing.

4558
04:18:56,910 --> 04:18:58,290
Oh, my god, we're doing it.

4559
04:18:59,310 --> 04:19:00,650
He's fucking figuring out.

4560
04:19:00,830 --> 04:19:02,150
He's thinking with portals.

4561
04:19:02,970 --> 04:19:03,970
Oh, my god!

4562
04:19:04,930 --> 04:19:06,050
That's crazy.

4563
04:19:09,310 --> 04:19:10,690
I'm just gonna stay here.

4564
04:19:18,120 --> 04:19:19,240
Where's Magneto?

4565
04:19:19,240 --> 04:19:20,640
Is he okay?

4566
04:19:21,840 --> 04:19:22,780
Down there?

4567
04:19:23,400 --> 04:19:25,980
Is he okay down there?

4568
04:19:28,600 --> 04:19:30,120
That's, like, fucking freaking me out.

4569
04:19:30,180 --> 04:19:31,100
I thought I was lagging.

4570
04:19:31,520 --> 04:19:32,520
Guys, get on the point.

4571
04:19:36,810 --> 04:19:37,170
Nice.

4572
04:19:37,350 --> 04:19:38,430
We basically did what they did.

4573
04:19:39,510 --> 04:19:40,450
You're awake now.

4574
04:19:41,130 --> 04:19:41,570
Wake up.

4575
04:19:42,090 --> 04:19:42,510
Wake up.

4576
04:19:45,570 --> 04:19:46,090
Nice.

4577
04:19:47,590 --> 04:19:48,590
That was smart.

4578
04:19:49,670 --> 04:19:50,270
Oh, my god.

4579
04:19:50,270 --> 04:19:51,430
People are learning the game.

4580
04:19:51,610 --> 04:19:53,990
People are actually learning the game, but they don't know yet.

4581
04:19:54,170 --> 04:19:55,950
They don't know yet what to actually do.

4582
04:19:56,690 --> 04:19:58,450
They're learning, but they don't know what's ideal.

4583
04:19:59,650 --> 04:20:01,350
Because this reminds me of Volskaya.

4584
04:20:01,550 --> 04:20:05,350
You know, where the DPS, where people would be over there?

4585
04:20:06,570 --> 04:20:08,390
It reminds me of Volskaya.

4586
04:20:11,110 --> 04:20:11,510
Okay.

4587
04:20:12,050 --> 04:20:14,470
And we have three supports, so one of them can push up.

4588
04:20:17,350 --> 04:20:17,750
Okay.

4589
04:20:18,990 --> 04:20:19,710
Okay.

4590
04:20:19,730 --> 04:20:20,330
Nice.

4591
04:20:22,610 --> 04:20:23,170
Alright.

4592
04:20:26,840 --> 04:20:28,000
I'm gonna do this.

4593
04:20:29,300 --> 04:20:30,640
I missed.

4594
04:20:32,240 --> 04:20:34,500
It was a nice gamble.

4595
04:20:35,120 --> 04:20:37,340
Sometimes it hits and sometimes it doesn't.

4596
04:20:37,640 --> 04:20:38,420
Let's go gambling.

4597
04:20:38,780 --> 04:20:40,500
It's all about that gambling life.

4598
04:20:45,680 --> 04:20:47,340
Oh, my god.

4599
04:20:48,220 --> 04:20:49,820
Oh, my god.

4600
04:20:49,900 --> 04:20:51,140
Okay, that's a lot of...

4601
04:20:51,140 --> 04:20:53,380
Guys, how did you guys get ult already?

4602
04:20:55,240 --> 04:20:56,380
Wait a minute.

4603
04:20:58,040 --> 04:20:59,580
Wait, how did you guys get ult?

4604
04:21:02,630 --> 04:21:04,890
I'm still here trying to figure this shit out.

4605
04:21:09,250 --> 04:21:10,030
Oh, no.

4606
04:21:10,970 --> 04:21:12,370
Guys, I'm so close.

4607
04:21:12,550 --> 04:21:13,110
I got it.

4608
04:21:13,270 --> 04:21:13,770
I got it.

4609
04:21:14,550 --> 04:21:15,050
Let's go.

4610
04:21:15,970 --> 04:21:16,510
It's time.

4611
04:21:17,990 --> 04:21:19,130
We're putting on a show.

4612
04:21:19,310 --> 04:21:20,730
That's fucking right.

4613
04:21:20,730 --> 04:21:23,590
It might have taken me forever to get...

4614
04:21:23,590 --> 04:21:26,090
Oh, I can't jump up because I'm too busy dancing.

4615
04:21:27,050 --> 04:21:32,410
Guys, don't you hate it when you're dancing so much that you can't jump?

4616
04:21:38,250 --> 04:21:39,550
It's not fair.

4617
04:21:42,050 --> 04:21:45,950
How did they get support ult so fucking fast?

4618
04:21:47,710 --> 04:21:49,270
I'm out here trying fucking...

4619
04:21:49,590 --> 04:21:52,270
I'm fucking begging for support ult right now.

4620
04:21:52,550 --> 04:21:55,190
Please, somebody get damage so I can heal.

4621
04:21:56,110 --> 04:21:56,790
Oh.

4622
04:21:57,530 --> 04:21:57,930
Goodbye.

4623
04:21:58,330 --> 04:21:59,970
He hit the bridge!

4624
04:22:04,150 --> 04:22:05,430
Oh, my god.

4625
04:22:06,090 --> 04:22:08,330
He hit the fucking bridge.

4626
04:22:08,670 --> 04:22:09,570
Oh, my god.

4627
04:22:10,030 --> 04:22:11,950
I wasn't paying attention.

4628
04:22:11,950 --> 04:22:12,550
Oh, my god.

4629
04:22:14,810 --> 04:22:16,050
It's so funny.

4630
04:22:18,630 --> 04:22:22,210
It's so funny so I didn't pay attention.

4631
04:22:25,730 --> 04:22:27,050
I wasn't...

4632
04:22:27,050 --> 04:22:28,570
I wasn't paying attention.

4633
04:22:32,490 --> 04:22:34,890
Oh, you're gonna live.

4634
04:22:35,110 --> 04:22:36,290
You're gonna live, Strange.

4635
04:22:36,750 --> 04:22:38,370
You're gonna fucking live.

4636
04:22:42,490 --> 04:22:43,910
It was funny though.

4637
04:22:44,050 --> 04:22:45,070
It was so funny.

4638
04:22:48,490 --> 04:22:49,090
Okay.

4639
04:22:50,530 --> 04:22:52,150
Bro, I'm 60%!

4640
04:22:56,610 --> 04:22:59,130
Bro, I'm 60% ult charge!

4641
04:23:00,010 --> 04:23:01,610
This is not fair!

4642
04:23:02,490 --> 04:23:03,270
Okay, I'm 80% now.

4643
04:23:07,560 --> 04:23:08,220
Wait, is he ulting?

4644
04:23:09,840 --> 04:23:10,900
Wait, oh, no.

4645
04:23:11,400 --> 04:23:11,980
Oh, no.

4646
04:23:14,820 --> 04:23:15,480
Okay.

4647
04:23:15,580 --> 04:23:16,200
I'm okay.

4648
04:23:21,420 --> 04:23:21,930
He's one.

4649
04:23:22,590 --> 04:23:22,990
Yes!

4650
04:23:23,210 --> 04:23:23,730
We got him!

4651
04:23:25,770 --> 04:23:26,430
Yes!

4652
04:23:27,170 --> 04:23:29,510
Guys, you know what that means, guys.

4653
04:23:30,790 --> 04:23:35,410
You know what that means.

4654
04:23:35,730 --> 04:23:36,270
Oh, shit.

4655
04:23:37,590 --> 04:23:40,130
They're ready to put on a show!

4656
04:23:40,130 --> 04:23:40,290
Oh!

4657
04:23:45,090 --> 04:23:46,330
It's time.

4658
04:23:49,710 --> 04:23:51,070
The battlecry.

4659
04:23:51,210 --> 04:23:53,690
Everybody just shooting the fucking drum.

4660
04:23:56,470 --> 04:23:57,230
Oh, my god.

4661
04:23:57,310 --> 04:23:57,870
The drum.

4662
04:23:58,230 --> 04:24:00,410
I don't think that was a solo right there.

4663
04:24:00,890 --> 04:24:01,810
Oh, my god.

4664
04:24:01,830 --> 04:24:03,110
How close am I?

4665
04:24:03,330 --> 04:24:04,930
How close am I?

4666
04:24:08,240 --> 04:24:10,200
How close am I?

4667
04:24:11,500 --> 04:24:12,540
I don't know!

4668
04:24:14,180 --> 04:24:14,800
Is it 80?

4669
04:24:14,800 --> 04:24:15,740
It's 80, right?

4670
04:24:17,080 --> 04:24:17,640
Okay.

4671
04:24:18,000 --> 04:24:18,720
Let's see.

4672
04:24:22,880 --> 04:24:24,440
Oh, it's getting close.

4673
04:24:24,580 --> 04:24:24,800
No!

4674
04:24:25,040 --> 04:24:28,340
I might have to beat Diamond soon to be in it.

4675
04:24:28,780 --> 04:24:29,340
No!

4676
04:24:29,720 --> 04:24:31,000
I need to get there faster!

4677
04:24:31,700 --> 04:24:33,180
They're climbing so fast!

4678
04:24:34,300 --> 04:24:35,160
Oh, we're sure for it.

4679
04:24:37,420 --> 04:24:38,540
I can't even...

4680
04:24:38,540 --> 04:24:39,160
He's definitely...

4681
04:24:39,160 --> 04:24:40,060
He's definitely...

4682
04:24:41,960 --> 04:24:43,100
Oh, my god.

4683
04:24:43,560 --> 04:24:46,620
They're climbing so fast that like...

4684
04:24:46,620 --> 04:24:48,160
I might even have to beat Diamond.

4685
04:24:53,900 --> 04:24:55,480
Everybody, stop playing!

4686
04:24:57,500 --> 04:24:58,820
Everybody and Diamond!

4687
04:24:59,520 --> 04:25:00,600
Stop playing!

4688
04:25:02,000 --> 04:25:03,120
Right now!

4689
04:25:04,100 --> 04:25:04,820
I need to use the bathroom.

4690
04:25:05,000 --> 04:25:05,400
I'll be right back.

4691
04:25:41,670 --> 04:25:43,490
30 seconds before you attack.

4692
04:25:43,710 --> 04:25:44,350
Get ready!

4693
04:25:48,240 --> 04:25:50,380
I owe you one for rescuing me from Hydra, Clint.

4694
04:25:50,860 --> 04:25:52,280
We do make a pretty good team.

4695
04:25:52,820 --> 04:25:54,700
Kate's not returning my calls, so...

4696
04:25:55,300 --> 04:25:55,820
What do you say?

4697
04:25:56,220 --> 04:25:57,060
Wanna be my new partner?

4698
04:25:57,640 --> 04:25:59,160
I said I owe you one.

4699
04:25:59,760 --> 04:26:01,180
Eh, I'll take what I can get.

4700
04:26:05,700 --> 04:26:07,780
The battle starts in 5...

4701
04:26:08,320 --> 04:26:08,800
4...

4702
04:26:09,300 --> 04:26:09,780
3...

4703
04:26:10,340 --> 04:26:10,820
2...

4704
04:26:10,820 --> 04:26:11,200
1!

4705
04:26:11,940 --> 04:26:12,420
Back!

4706
04:26:14,300 --> 04:26:15,480
I'm back.

4707
04:26:17,340 --> 04:26:18,540
I'm back.

4708
04:26:18,800 --> 04:26:20,060
Alright, here we go.

4709
04:26:25,390 --> 04:26:26,270
Come on!

4710
04:26:30,070 --> 04:26:31,130
I wish I know...

4711
04:26:31,130 --> 04:26:32,680
What the fuck?!

4712
04:26:35,570 --> 04:26:38,070
I wish I know like who's talking sometimes.

4713
04:26:38,190 --> 04:26:39,510
It's so annoying because I don't know.

4714
04:26:41,850 --> 04:26:42,470
Guys...

4715
04:26:42,470 --> 04:26:44,770
Guys, I cannot keep track of you guys.

4716
04:26:48,190 --> 04:26:49,300
Guys, you guys...

4717
04:26:49,610 --> 04:26:52,850
You guys are LOSing the healers, guys.

4718
04:27:01,330 --> 04:27:01,950
Yeah,

4719
04:27:08,830 --> 04:27:11,330
I think porting would've been the first thing you do.

4720
04:27:13,190 --> 04:27:14,050
We're gonna port.

4721
04:27:14,550 --> 04:27:15,530
Alright, here we go.

4722
04:27:20,850 --> 04:27:21,450
Guys...

4723
04:27:21,450 --> 04:27:23,690
Hey guys...

4724
04:27:26,210 --> 04:27:27,590
Alright, here we go.

4725
04:27:29,970 --> 04:27:32,310
Fucking hell, oh my god, that poor guy.

4726
04:27:35,810 --> 04:27:36,910
He's so low!

4727
04:27:41,530 --> 04:27:42,450
Oh my god.

4728
04:27:43,710 --> 04:27:44,950
Please, he's so low!

4729
04:27:47,190 --> 04:27:48,970
I'm ready to put on a show!

4730
04:27:49,770 --> 04:27:51,790
No, they're also putting a show!

4731
04:27:54,310 --> 04:27:55,230
Okay.

4732
04:27:56,050 --> 04:27:56,970
Alright.

4733
04:27:57,570 --> 04:28:00,070
And I am ready to fucking leave.

4734
04:28:05,930 --> 04:28:08,350
Oh my god, really?!

4735
04:28:12,190 --> 04:28:13,110
No...

4736
04:28:13,110 --> 04:28:13,950
I feared.

4737
04:28:13,950 --> 04:28:14,010
I feared.

4738
04:28:17,470 --> 04:28:19,410
There's two shows?!

4739
04:28:19,410 --> 04:28:19,870
That's illegal!

4740
04:28:20,870 --> 04:28:23,310
Was she trying to fucking take the attention away from me?

4741
04:28:23,810 --> 04:28:24,630
Fucking whore.

4742
04:28:25,970 --> 04:28:27,270
How dare she.

4743
04:28:32,230 --> 04:28:33,530
Alright, I need to go.

4744
04:28:34,170 --> 04:28:35,270
Okay, goodbye.

4745
04:28:37,790 --> 04:28:38,430
Jeez.

4746
04:28:40,230 --> 04:28:42,470
How dare she steal my spotlight.

4747
04:28:42,470 --> 04:28:43,830
What a bitch.

4748
04:28:52,690 --> 04:28:55,130
I'm gonna put on the other tank because...

4749
04:28:56,430 --> 04:28:57,730
Oh my god, I had a feeling.

4750
04:28:58,130 --> 04:29:00,170
Oh, that was insane!

4751
04:29:04,050 --> 04:29:06,250
Oh my god, that ult was crazy!

4752
04:29:08,130 --> 04:29:10,350
The Overwatch player was...

4753
04:29:10,350 --> 04:29:11,310
Bro, the Groot!

4754
04:29:11,570 --> 04:29:13,130
Did you guys see the wall from...

4755
04:29:16,300 --> 04:29:18,180
Can she say that?

4756
04:29:18,500 --> 04:29:19,720
Guys, it's okay, I came from Overwatch.

4757
04:29:24,740 --> 04:29:29,640
That was a crazy play from the Groot.

4758
04:29:30,140 --> 04:29:30,560
Honestly.

4759
04:29:44,100 --> 04:29:46,360
Oh my god.

4760
04:29:48,060 --> 04:29:48,980
Oh...

4761
04:29:50,340 --> 04:29:51,260
Okay.

4762
04:29:52,700 --> 04:29:53,700
I'm running out of health.

4763
04:29:53,840 --> 04:29:56,280
I'm gonna save my ult.

4764
04:29:58,120 --> 04:29:58,600
Goodbye.

4765
04:30:01,120 --> 04:30:02,120
Keep walking with me, bro.

4766
04:30:02,220 --> 04:30:02,860
It's kind of nice.

4767
04:30:03,080 --> 04:30:03,960
I can kill them all.

4768
04:30:04,380 --> 04:30:04,640
Whee!

4769
04:30:05,760 --> 04:30:06,240
Okay.

4770
04:30:08,140 --> 04:30:09,360
That was good.

4771
04:30:09,620 --> 04:30:10,520
That was my bad.

4772
04:30:10,600 --> 04:30:11,100
I was too forward.

4773
04:30:13,340 --> 04:30:14,960
Our Hanzo is really good.

4774
04:30:14,980 --> 04:30:15,520
Our Hawkeye.

4775
04:30:16,880 --> 04:30:18,820
Sorry, surefour, you're not getting orbs.

4776
04:30:19,020 --> 04:30:21,320
I can kill them.

4777
04:30:26,880 --> 04:30:31,280
Don't kill that!

4778
04:30:33,890 --> 04:30:34,220
Bro.

4779
04:30:34,740 --> 04:30:36,080
Bro, I'm sorry, man.

4780
04:30:36,180 --> 04:30:37,800
I cannot kill that, bro.

4781
04:30:38,440 --> 04:30:39,620
That shit.

4782
04:30:41,010 --> 04:30:42,740
That shit is a little too much.

4783
04:30:43,220 --> 04:30:46,160
That shit was definitely a little too much, guys.

4784
04:30:56,550 --> 04:30:57,990
Oh my god, please.

4785
04:31:01,010 --> 04:31:03,530
Oh my god, I'm so sorry.

4786
04:31:03,930 --> 04:31:04,470
I'm so sorry.

4787
04:31:04,850 --> 04:31:06,750
Oh my god, they're dancing.

4788
04:31:07,110 --> 04:31:09,170
They're dancing, Dr. Strange.

4789
04:31:09,330 --> 04:31:10,150
What do we do?

4790
04:31:10,270 --> 04:31:11,270
They're dancing.

4791
04:31:14,770 --> 04:31:16,030
Holy fuck.

4792
04:31:17,630 --> 04:31:18,350
Okay.

4793
04:31:28,990 --> 04:31:29,710
Okay.

4794
04:31:37,270 --> 04:31:39,410
Oh my god, please.

4795
04:31:39,770 --> 04:31:40,170
Please.

4796
04:31:40,430 --> 04:31:40,670
No!

4797
04:31:41,290 --> 04:31:42,710
We got ulted.

4798
04:31:44,990 --> 04:31:46,730
There's nothing we can do.

4799
04:31:46,830 --> 04:31:47,530
We got ulted.

4800
04:31:47,630 --> 04:31:48,190
That's okay.

4801
04:31:48,610 --> 04:31:49,870
Surefour started punching!

4802
04:32:03,760 --> 04:32:04,980
Okay, we're fine.

4803
04:32:05,720 --> 04:32:07,460
He just started punching.

4804
04:32:07,760 --> 04:32:11,620
Help me, help me.

4805
04:32:11,680 --> 04:32:12,220
Please, please, please.

4806
04:32:12,780 --> 04:32:13,660
I'm fucking...

4807
04:32:13,660 --> 04:32:16,360
We're giving you so much heals!

4808
04:32:22,460 --> 04:32:24,240
Oh my god!

4809
04:32:24,420 --> 04:32:25,060
Everything...

4810
04:32:25,060 --> 04:32:26,020
I'm just healing.

4811
04:32:26,480 --> 04:32:27,940
I've never stopped healing you.

4812
04:32:27,940 --> 04:32:29,600
Oh shit.

4813
04:32:31,740 --> 04:32:33,320
We never stopped healing!

4814
04:32:36,380 --> 04:32:49,100
Oh my god, please.

4815
04:32:53,180 --> 04:32:53,900
Guys.

4816
04:32:54,120 --> 04:32:55,300
Guys, you're scaring me.

4817
04:32:55,720 --> 04:32:57,080
Guys, you're scaring me.

4818
04:32:57,080 --> 04:32:57,540
Guys.

4819
04:32:58,580 --> 04:32:59,180
Guys!

4820
04:33:07,800 --> 04:33:09,640
Oh my god, please.

4821
04:33:13,920 --> 04:33:14,860
Oh my god, he's grooting.

4822
04:33:14,940 --> 04:33:15,660
He's grooting again.

4823
04:33:17,220 --> 04:33:17,840
Get over...

4824
04:33:17,840 --> 04:33:18,140
No!

4825
04:33:18,700 --> 04:33:19,120
No!

4826
04:33:23,000 --> 04:33:23,600
No!

4827
04:33:30,010 --> 04:33:31,450
Oh my god.

4828
04:33:32,070 --> 04:33:33,110
Oh my god, he's living!

4829
04:33:36,150 --> 04:33:37,090
Bro, he's living!

4830
04:33:39,290 --> 04:33:40,430
Bro, just live!

4831
04:33:41,610 --> 04:33:44,770
Oh my god, Doran's the item of...

4832
04:33:44,770 --> 04:33:45,610
The item, whatever.

4833
04:33:48,430 --> 04:33:50,470
Oh, he's putting a show again.

4834
04:33:52,290 --> 04:33:53,450
I wish you could just...

4835
04:33:53,450 --> 04:33:53,690
What?

4836
04:33:57,770 --> 04:33:59,150
Where are you?

4837
04:34:02,950 --> 04:34:03,510
No!

4838
04:34:11,850 --> 04:34:13,070
What the fuck?

4839
04:34:13,810 --> 04:34:17,130
The current score is 2-2.

4840
04:34:17,430 --> 04:34:18,050
Sorry, 4-4.

4841
04:34:19,250 --> 04:34:22,050
We just gotta...

4842
04:34:23,350 --> 04:34:26,150
We just gotta protect our Hanzo.

4843
04:34:27,530 --> 04:34:29,890
I'm killing everybody except the Psylocke.

4844
04:34:30,290 --> 04:34:31,910
They insta-locked?

4845
04:34:32,010 --> 04:34:33,750
Who are you, you fucker?

4846
04:34:38,610 --> 04:34:39,870
You fucker!

4847
04:34:39,870 --> 04:34:40,250
You fucker!

4848
04:34:40,570 --> 04:34:45,030
I can't believe they insta-locked her.

4849
04:34:45,290 --> 04:34:47,210
I can't believe it.

4850
04:34:49,550 --> 04:34:51,930
I gotta avoid them now.

4851
04:34:55,310 --> 04:34:59,550
No, there's no reason to play Jeff.

4852
04:35:00,630 --> 04:35:02,490
I gotta avoid this Luna player.

4853
04:35:02,850 --> 04:35:03,970
How dare you?

4854
04:35:04,830 --> 04:35:07,930
How fucking dare you, you fucker!

4855
04:35:09,870 --> 04:35:11,870
What the fuck?

4856
04:35:14,790 --> 04:35:16,730
That's right, get out of my lobby!

4857
04:35:18,750 --> 04:35:20,590
Alright, I don't know how to play Mantis, so we're gonna lose.

4858
04:35:21,910 --> 04:35:22,970
He's gonna learn today.

4859
04:35:26,070 --> 04:35:28,150
He's gonna learn today that I'm a one-trick.

4860
04:35:42,130 --> 04:35:43,590
How dare they also...

4861
04:35:43,590 --> 04:35:45,630
Peter can only be one Luna, one-trick.

4862
04:35:45,730 --> 04:35:46,870
And it's me!

4863
04:36:13,080 --> 04:36:14,380
What the fuck?

4864
04:36:16,480 --> 04:36:18,020
Oh my god!

4865
04:36:19,100 --> 04:36:20,200
That shit's crazy.

4866
04:36:23,460 --> 04:36:26,640
He's gonna learn that I don't know how to play this character.

4867
04:36:47,040 --> 04:36:47,460
I...

4868
04:36:47,460 --> 04:36:47,780
Alright, go!

4869
04:36:47,920 --> 04:36:48,760
Go do your thing!

4870
04:36:49,780 --> 04:36:51,780
Go feel... Oh my god!

4871
04:36:51,960 --> 04:36:55,120
I... I healed you so much, like, I don't know what you want me to do.

4872
04:36:56,100 --> 04:36:58,260
Go feel inspired right now!

4873
04:37:03,220 --> 04:37:05,080
I don't know her projectiles.

4874
04:37:05,420 --> 04:37:06,780
And that's my issue too.

4875
04:37:08,280 --> 04:37:10,440
I don't know her projectile speed.

4876
04:37:11,300 --> 04:37:12,220
So I can't...

4877
04:37:13,180 --> 04:37:14,060
Be inspired!

4878
04:37:16,020 --> 04:37:18,680
Yeah, like, what the fuck is her projectile?

4879
04:37:24,610 --> 04:37:25,530
That's right.

4880
04:37:26,030 --> 04:37:26,970
Be inspired!

4881
04:37:29,030 --> 04:37:30,510
Still be inspired!

4882
04:37:31,130 --> 04:37:32,790
Keep being inspired!

4883
04:37:34,030 --> 04:37:35,710
Go do your thing!

4884
04:37:39,710 --> 04:37:40,790
Inspire!

4885
04:37:46,390 --> 04:37:49,210
Oh, what the fuck is her projectile speed?

4886
04:37:51,410 --> 04:37:52,970
Go do your thing!

4887
04:37:53,450 --> 04:37:55,430
Feel so strong!

4888
04:37:56,210 --> 04:37:58,510
Feel... Oh my god.

4889
04:38:00,050 --> 04:38:00,610
Um...

4890
04:38:00,610 --> 04:38:01,490
Good luck.

4891
04:38:06,360 --> 04:38:07,220
Let's go.

4892
04:38:08,060 --> 04:38:09,340
Go do your thing.

4893
04:38:13,370 --> 04:38:15,050
Oh my god, that's fine.

4894
04:38:15,170 --> 04:38:16,090
It was not gonna work.

4895
04:38:16,390 --> 04:38:17,810
I wanted to swap off anyway.

4896
04:38:18,850 --> 04:38:19,990
Uh... I don't know.

4897
04:38:21,130 --> 04:38:22,690
I could do... Let's do Cloak and Dagger.

4898
04:38:23,750 --> 04:38:24,810
Let's play Mystery Hero.

4899
04:38:29,030 --> 04:38:30,390
Oh my god.

4900
04:38:31,570 --> 04:38:33,350
Let's play Mystery Hero.

4901
04:38:33,710 --> 04:38:34,390
Fuck it.

4902
04:38:42,540 --> 04:38:43,140
Okay,

4903
04:38:46,880 --> 04:38:47,320
that's fine.

4904
04:38:51,950 --> 04:38:52,490
Get healed!

4905
04:38:57,520 --> 04:38:58,120
Nice!

4906
04:39:01,080 --> 04:39:03,660
I don't know when I'll ever use Cloak, but I'll just heal.

4907
04:39:05,880 --> 04:39:08,080
We'll be like... just Dagger.

4908
04:39:09,920 --> 04:39:11,720
We'll just be Dagger.

4909
04:39:15,440 --> 04:39:18,560
I don't know how to use the other heroes.

4910
04:39:25,070 --> 04:39:26,290
Just Dagger.

4911
04:39:28,990 --> 04:39:30,790
But just Dagger, please.

4912
04:39:39,180 --> 04:39:40,280
Oh shit.

4913
04:39:41,140 --> 04:39:41,580
Oh,

4914
04:39:46,600 --> 04:39:47,620
we're gonna push in?

4915
04:39:49,740 --> 04:39:50,620
Oh, nevermind.

4916
04:39:55,160 --> 04:39:56,880
We're not gonna lose this game, are we?

4917
04:39:57,620 --> 04:40:01,280
Yeah, we're not gonna lose this game, right guys?

4918
04:40:01,800 --> 04:40:02,680
Right guys?

4919
04:40:03,220 --> 04:40:05,580
With two Luna one-tricks, we're not gonna lose that game, right?

4920
04:40:07,300 --> 04:40:08,300
Surely we're not.

4921
04:40:11,580 --> 04:40:13,040
Is that gonna ult us?

4922
04:40:19,820 --> 04:40:20,460
There we go.

4923
04:40:22,260 --> 04:40:24,000
Oh my god, they're all putting the show again.

4924
04:40:27,570 --> 04:40:28,150
No!

4925
04:40:28,710 --> 04:40:30,370
Put on a show, Luna!

4926
04:40:32,730 --> 04:40:35,450
No, she doesn't have the show!

4927
04:40:41,900 --> 04:40:44,680
If only we can be two Lunas, guys.

4928
04:40:46,300 --> 04:40:47,540
How do I fucking run?

4929
04:40:48,720 --> 04:40:49,400
Oh, okay.

4930
04:40:50,960 --> 04:40:52,080
That's how I leave.

4931
04:40:53,560 --> 04:40:55,120
Oh, I should have Cloaked there.

4932
04:40:56,040 --> 04:40:58,200
I think if I Cloaked, it would have been fine.

4933
04:41:01,220 --> 04:41:01,520
Okay.

4934
04:41:05,900 --> 04:41:11,720
I think it's because, guys, I think we might lose because we have two Lunas.

4935
04:41:12,360 --> 04:41:13,380
It's just a maybe.

4936
04:41:16,460 --> 04:41:18,040
I don't know.

4937
04:41:19,460 --> 04:41:21,060
It could be it.

4938
04:41:21,600 --> 04:41:22,240
Honestly.

4939
04:41:22,240 --> 04:41:22,600
It could be it.

4940
04:41:30,170 --> 04:41:30,690
Okay.

4941
04:41:31,070 --> 04:41:32,390
I don't know why I went there.

4942
04:41:36,250 --> 04:41:37,430
Oh my god, please.

4943
04:41:37,930 --> 04:41:39,890
I'm trying my best to keep up.

4944
04:41:42,190 --> 04:41:43,230
Jesus Christ!

4945
04:41:44,970 --> 04:41:46,410
Oh my god!

4946
04:41:47,910 --> 04:41:50,430
I kept Doctor Strange up for so long!

4947
04:41:52,630 --> 04:41:59,070
I swear to god, if I check the stats and I still have more healing than this person, I swear to fucking god.

4948
04:42:03,290 --> 04:42:06,710
Sorry, I don't know how to play.

4949
04:42:07,330 --> 04:42:09,730
Guys, can you tell I don't know what I'm doing on this character?

4950
04:42:13,470 --> 04:42:13,970
No!

4951
04:42:14,550 --> 04:42:14,670
No!

4952
04:42:15,970 --> 04:42:17,130
He saw me!

4953
04:42:18,490 --> 04:42:20,470
I didn't think he'd turn around!

4954
04:42:25,700 --> 04:42:26,200
Alright.

4955
04:42:26,480 --> 04:42:29,300
I hope they avoid me, so I'll avoid them just in case.

4956
04:42:31,260 --> 04:42:32,060
Just in case.

4957
04:42:37,740 --> 04:42:41,660
Guys, I don't know how to play the dagger and cloak.

4958
04:42:46,920 --> 04:42:48,040
Wait, who is- which one?

4959
04:42:48,140 --> 04:42:48,520
No, cloak.

4960
04:42:48,580 --> 04:42:50,380
I don't know how to play the cloak and dagger.

4961
04:42:50,800 --> 04:42:51,680
Yeah, that's what I meant.

4962
04:42:51,780 --> 04:42:52,000
Okay.

4963
04:42:52,900 --> 04:42:53,580
Give me a chance.

4964
04:42:53,680 --> 04:42:54,100
Come on.

4965
04:42:54,780 --> 04:42:55,220
Come on.

4966
04:42:55,260 --> 04:42:56,940
I can't- I can't avoid them yet.

4967
04:42:57,500 --> 04:42:57,860
Okay.

4968
04:42:58,100 --> 04:42:58,620
There we go.

4969
04:42:59,700 --> 04:43:00,020
There we go.

4970
04:43:00,080 --> 04:43:01,200
There can only be one.

4971
04:43:01,200 --> 04:43:09,680
And I'm gonna avoid you just in case you're also a- just in case you're also a Luna player, I'm gonna- Just in case.

4972
04:43:10,000 --> 04:43:12,580
I can't.

4973
04:43:12,740 --> 04:43:13,960
I can't also.

4974
04:43:19,680 --> 04:43:21,380
I gotta get them.

4975
04:43:21,700 --> 04:43:29,520
I don't know how many- I don't know how many, like, uh, uh, avoid slots you get.

4976
04:43:29,520 --> 04:43:32,540
But I'm making sure- I got- I'm trying to, like, get all my priorities straight.

4977
04:43:32,960 --> 04:43:33,700
Oh my god.

4978
04:43:33,900 --> 04:43:35,660
Games are definitely harder because he's in diamond now.

4979
04:43:38,840 --> 04:43:40,100
There can only be one.

4980
04:43:40,780 --> 04:43:44,800
I mean, I learned the Luna par- I learned the dagger part a little bit.

4981
04:43:45,000 --> 04:43:47,620
I just don't know how to do cloak yet.

4982
04:43:48,360 --> 04:43:50,200
I get so confused on cloak.

4983
04:43:51,980 --> 04:43:54,180
I just don't know how to play cloak at the moment.

4984
04:44:09,310 --> 04:44:11,470
Okay, let's see.

4985
04:44:12,190 --> 04:44:12,770
Yeah!

4986
04:44:13,530 --> 04:44:14,910
There's no other support player!

4987
04:44:15,110 --> 04:44:15,570
Let's go!

4988
04:44:20,620 --> 04:44:21,420
Oh.

4989
04:44:32,210 --> 04:44:33,710
Alright, here we go.

4990
04:44:42,350 --> 04:44:43,150
Yeah!

4991
04:44:45,470 --> 04:44:46,270
Okay.

4992
04:44:46,570 --> 04:44:46,750
Wait, what?

4993
04:44:46,750 --> 04:44:47,810
Okay, we're- there we go.

4994
04:44:48,750 --> 04:44:49,790
Oh my god, thank god.

4995
04:44:50,890 --> 04:44:52,450
Top 500 in two days?

4996
04:44:52,530 --> 04:44:53,170
It's possible!

4997
04:44:54,270 --> 04:44:57,850
I literally need to- we just need to win, like, two- three games, I think.

4998
04:44:58,250 --> 04:45:00,270
Three games, and then we'll be top 500.

4999
04:45:03,630 --> 04:45:04,650
Just three games.

5000
04:45:04,770 --> 04:45:05,350
Come on!

5001
04:45:07,350 --> 04:45:08,790
Just three games!

5002
04:45:10,810 --> 04:45:13,790
If I avoid all the other Lunas, it'll work!

5003
04:45:16,750 --> 04:45:17,370
I hate this map.

5004
04:45:17,610 --> 04:45:19,750
Honestly, like, um...

5005
04:45:21,610 --> 04:45:24,850
This is, like- I think this is, like, my most hated map.

5006
04:45:25,010 --> 04:45:27,330
Only because I've been fucking playing this map for 20 years.

5007
04:45:27,770 --> 04:45:30,910
Like, I've been playing this map for so long.

5008
04:45:32,130 --> 04:45:35,110
It's always this map for some fucking reason.

5009
04:45:37,010 --> 04:45:38,290
Do you think our Thor's gonna die?

5010
04:45:40,690 --> 04:45:41,750
Oh, there he is.

5011
04:45:43,850 --> 04:45:44,890
Yeah, I called it.

5012
04:45:48,150 --> 04:45:49,330
There he is.

5013
04:45:49,530 --> 04:45:50,190
Dead.

5014
04:45:55,280 --> 04:45:56,460
Holy shit.

5015
04:46:00,900 --> 04:46:02,340
Oh my god, please.

5016
04:46:05,500 --> 04:46:06,160
Please.

5017
04:46:06,620 --> 04:46:10,460
I realize that we can't push at all.

5018
04:46:12,220 --> 04:46:13,580
I can't even get there.

5019
04:46:13,680 --> 04:46:13,860
Okay.

5020
04:46:14,800 --> 04:46:17,100
Oh my god, what the fuck do we do with this guy?

5021
04:46:18,030 --> 04:46:20,960
Of all the characters you can grapple!

5022
04:46:21,540 --> 04:46:23,180
Fuck you, why him?

5023
04:46:28,950 --> 04:46:29,410
Nice.

5024
04:46:33,690 --> 04:46:34,350
Okay.

5025
04:46:37,090 --> 04:46:38,310
Oh, he shielded.

5026
04:46:41,450 --> 04:46:42,110
Oh.

5027
04:46:42,710 --> 04:46:43,050
Oh.

5028
04:46:45,550 --> 04:46:46,210
How?!

5029
04:46:46,210 --> 04:46:49,030
My guys barely took- Okay, to be fair, they have two teams.

5030
04:46:51,770 --> 04:46:52,890
Okay, come on.

5031
04:46:54,190 --> 04:46:55,890
They actually have two teams, that's how.

5032
04:46:56,190 --> 04:46:58,010
I was like, how the fuck do you farm that shit?

5033
04:47:01,070 --> 04:47:02,790
I just feel bad for our...

5034
04:47:04,590 --> 04:47:05,150
Please.

5035
04:47:07,290 --> 04:47:08,310
We gotta kill.

5036
04:47:11,370 --> 04:47:13,610
Oh, this is a really good Hawkeye.

5037
04:47:15,070 --> 04:47:17,590
Second take or I'm burning!

5038
04:47:17,590 --> 04:47:19,210
Spiderman!

5039
04:47:19,870 --> 04:47:21,730
That's crazy!

5040
04:47:23,650 --> 04:47:25,350
Oh my god!

5041
04:47:29,670 --> 04:47:32,030
Bro, that's like wild!

5042
04:47:32,710 --> 04:47:34,210
He's gonna hold us hostage!

5043
04:47:34,550 --> 04:47:36,990
Everyone, he's gonna hold us hostage!

5044
04:47:37,090 --> 04:47:37,830
What do we do?

5045
04:47:38,790 --> 04:47:39,670
No!

5046
04:47:49,110 --> 04:47:51,950
Bro, he's gonna- He's gonna do it!

5047
04:47:52,810 --> 04:47:54,770
Bro, he's not fucking around!

5048
04:47:55,070 --> 04:47:56,750
He's gonna actually do it!

5049
04:48:00,920 --> 04:48:03,000
Learning sp- Oh my god!

5050
04:48:05,960 --> 04:48:06,800
No!

5051
04:48:06,800 --> 04:48:07,220
Why?!

5052
04:48:07,640 --> 04:48:08,140
No!

5053
04:48:09,340 --> 04:48:11,740
How are my games that unlucky?

5054
04:48:14,940 --> 04:48:16,440
Oh my god.

5055
04:48:17,280 --> 04:48:18,740
Guys, he's learning Spiderman.

5056
04:48:19,000 --> 04:48:20,080
Guys, in Diamond.

5057
04:48:20,420 --> 04:48:22,480
This is actually the craziest part.

5058
04:48:23,800 --> 04:48:25,360
Bro, how did my games get that unlucky?

5059
04:48:27,900 --> 04:48:28,380
Guys,

5060
04:48:32,070 --> 04:48:32,470
it's okay.

5061
04:48:32,570 --> 04:48:34,070
We can out-DPS all of this.

5062
04:48:35,430 --> 04:48:36,470
You lost your point.

5063
04:48:36,730 --> 04:48:37,110
It's okay.

5064
04:48:37,210 --> 04:48:38,990
We can out-DPS all of this still.

5065
04:48:40,050 --> 04:48:40,630
It's okay.

5066
04:48:40,910 --> 04:48:43,250
We can out-kill this, maybe.

5067
04:48:46,050 --> 04:48:46,530
Alright.

5068
04:48:46,530 --> 04:48:46,730
Okay.

5069
04:48:47,110 --> 04:48:48,290
I leave now.

5070
04:48:54,330 --> 04:48:57,390
Now we have too many DPS players.

5071
04:48:59,670 --> 04:49:02,950
We actually have too many DPS players now.

5072
04:49:06,330 --> 04:49:07,630
Oh my god.

5073
04:49:08,150 --> 04:49:09,470
Guys, guys.

5074
04:49:09,750 --> 04:49:11,030
Guys, five seconds left.

5075
04:49:11,170 --> 04:49:11,430
Guys.

5076
04:49:12,750 --> 04:49:14,350
Oh hey, I cancelled it.

5077
04:49:22,130 --> 04:49:24,930
I'm furious.

5078
04:49:24,930 --> 04:49:27,690
Oh my god.

5079
04:49:31,090 --> 04:49:35,310
Thanks, DPS.

5080
04:49:36,670 --> 04:49:37,790
Question mark?

5081
04:49:39,270 --> 04:49:40,530
Oh my god.

5082
04:49:41,290 --> 04:49:44,630
How is this a DPS problem?

5083
04:49:45,190 --> 04:49:47,510
Holy shit, this guy.

5084
04:49:51,130 --> 04:49:54,810
I can't believe this guy said that.

5085
04:49:56,430 --> 04:49:57,910
Oh my god.

5086
04:49:58,670 --> 04:50:01,970
I can't believe he said that.

5087
04:50:03,110 --> 04:50:04,870
Oh my god.

5088
04:50:05,750 --> 04:50:08,210
Of course the DPS said that.

5089
04:50:10,530 --> 04:50:12,010
Oh my god.

5090
04:50:13,090 --> 04:50:15,270
That's crazy.

5091
04:50:17,250 --> 04:50:19,930
That's actually crazy.

5092
04:50:25,890 --> 04:50:26,860
Oh my god.

5093
04:50:26,880 --> 04:50:30,300
This is high ELO but very egotistical DPS players.

5094
04:50:30,900 --> 04:50:31,280
Welcome.

5095
04:50:42,250 --> 04:50:45,770
Is there already top 500?

5096
04:50:46,910 --> 04:50:49,730
There already top 500 so they don't care as much.

5097
04:50:49,930 --> 04:50:52,810
Cause they know they can get it but I didn't get to be top 500 yet.

5098
04:50:57,660 --> 04:50:58,180
What?

5099
04:50:58,440 --> 04:51:00,300
Our guy literally said Spiderman.

5100
04:51:01,000 --> 04:51:03,140
Tink or I'm wearing Spiderman.

5101
04:51:06,000 --> 04:51:08,060
Wait, now we get another Tink?

5102
04:51:08,880 --> 04:51:09,820
Like, what?

5103
04:51:10,320 --> 04:51:11,300
This is fucked up.

5104
04:51:11,500 --> 04:51:13,020
Why do we get another Tink now?

5105
04:51:13,560 --> 04:51:15,020
This is fucked up.

5106
04:51:15,560 --> 04:51:17,740
This is actually fucked up.

5107
04:51:18,460 --> 04:51:20,940
Like, we have plenty of other times to...

5108
04:51:20,940 --> 04:51:23,080
We had plenty of other times.

5109
04:51:23,380 --> 04:51:24,900
Now we get another Tink.

5110
04:51:32,550 --> 04:51:33,610
Oh my god.

5111
04:51:33,710 --> 04:51:34,950
Feels just like Overwatch.

5112
04:51:35,510 --> 04:51:37,650
Feels just like Overwatch.

5113
04:51:51,090 --> 04:51:52,150
Holy shit.

5114
04:51:56,210 --> 04:51:57,330
Oh, it's me.

5115
04:51:57,590 --> 04:51:57,970
Wait, no.

5116
04:51:58,050 --> 04:51:58,630
That's not me.

5117
04:51:59,230 --> 04:52:01,030
I thought it was me cause it looked like...

5118
04:52:01,030 --> 04:52:01,590
Oh no.

5119
04:52:01,790 --> 04:52:02,170
No.

5120
04:52:02,550 --> 04:52:03,130
No.

5121
04:52:04,190 --> 04:52:06,630
Second game in a row they threw?

5122
04:52:07,410 --> 04:52:07,830
Who?

5123
04:52:08,850 --> 04:52:09,890
These two?

5124
04:52:13,130 --> 04:52:14,510
I'm playing... Who?

5125
04:52:18,930 --> 04:52:19,870
Bro, what?

5126
04:52:20,530 --> 04:52:22,730
Bro, he didn't swap to Tink.

5127
04:52:22,810 --> 04:52:23,970
Like, what do you mean?

5128
04:52:24,230 --> 04:52:25,810
What do you mean?

5129
04:52:25,810 --> 04:52:28,570
He didn't swap to Tink.

5130
04:52:33,450 --> 04:52:34,470
That's crazy.

5131
04:52:37,510 --> 04:52:39,590
That's actually crazy.

5132
04:52:40,790 --> 04:52:42,990
I don't believe the other guy.

5133
04:53:00,610 --> 04:53:01,690
Alright, here we go.

5134
04:53:02,210 --> 04:53:03,110
It's time to lock in.

5135
04:53:05,790 --> 04:53:06,710
Oh my god.

5136
04:53:06,710 --> 04:53:08,710
Please, I need like four wins.

5137
04:53:09,210 --> 04:53:09,470
Why?

5138
04:53:09,650 --> 04:53:10,830
When I get to plat?

5139
04:53:20,510 --> 04:53:22,310
Oh my god.

5140
04:53:25,250 --> 04:53:26,670
Oh my god.

5141
04:53:26,750 --> 04:53:28,830
Why is this so hard now?

5142
04:53:29,550 --> 04:53:32,550
It was smooth sailing before.

5143
04:53:33,450 --> 04:53:34,070
Please.

5144
04:53:34,630 --> 04:53:35,530
I just...

5145
04:53:37,070 --> 04:53:42,830
The battle starts in 5, 4, 3, 2, 1!

5146
04:53:43,310 --> 04:53:44,250
Alright, here we go.

5147
04:53:44,310 --> 04:53:46,190
All you need to do is capture the mission area.

5148
04:53:46,410 --> 04:53:48,130
Yeah, Top Island is still plat 1.

5149
04:53:48,650 --> 04:53:50,330
So this is the future.

5150
04:53:50,950 --> 04:53:52,470
Or one future, anyway.

5151
04:53:52,490 --> 04:53:53,210
Oh my god.

5152
04:53:54,050 --> 04:53:55,250
This is so difficult now.

5153
04:53:55,550 --> 04:53:57,510
I'm literally so close though.

5154
04:53:59,230 --> 04:54:01,250
Okay, at least we have one Tink.

5155
04:54:01,370 --> 04:54:02,830
Like, I'm happy with one Tink.

5156
04:54:05,790 --> 04:54:06,330
Oh my god, please.

5157
04:54:06,510 --> 04:54:07,530
Where is our Tink though?

5158
04:54:07,650 --> 04:54:08,490
Where did he go?

5159
04:54:09,130 --> 04:54:10,790
No, not the Tink.

5160
04:54:10,970 --> 04:54:13,770
Oh my god, I swear I'm playing like a puzzle.

5161
04:54:14,530 --> 04:54:15,860
I have to do like a fucking puzzle.

5162
04:54:19,790 --> 04:54:20,670
Oh my god, please.

5163
04:54:23,590 --> 04:54:24,610
I'm sorry!

5164
04:54:25,150 --> 04:54:27,150
I have to look so...

5165
04:54:27,150 --> 04:54:29,610
There's so many fucking walls!

5166
04:54:33,550 --> 04:54:35,210
Oh my god!

5167
04:54:37,290 --> 04:54:39,050
It's just all walls!

5168
04:54:45,440 --> 04:54:48,120
It's just walls!

5169
04:54:50,760 --> 04:54:51,880
How?!

5170
04:54:56,710 --> 04:54:57,690
Get him!

5171
04:55:03,850 --> 04:55:05,090
Get the support!

5172
04:55:07,530 --> 04:55:08,910
Oh my god, please.

5173
04:55:14,600 --> 04:55:15,800
Oh my god.

5174
04:55:16,060 --> 04:55:17,480
Oh my god, I'm sorry.

5175
04:55:17,880 --> 04:55:19,680
I'm sorry, I'm gonna use this now.

5176
04:55:20,100 --> 04:55:21,920
Bro, nobody's dying!

5177
04:55:24,360 --> 04:55:25,660
Oh no, I'm stuck.

5178
04:55:27,940 --> 04:55:32,260
No, now she's gonna put on a show and now we're never gonna leave.

5179
04:55:34,960 --> 04:55:36,740
Oh my god.

5180
04:55:37,960 --> 04:55:40,340
We never got the point back.

5181
04:55:41,060 --> 04:55:43,800
That's actually crazy that people put Overwatch in their name.

5182
04:55:44,340 --> 04:55:47,540
Like, I think Overwatch is literally the only game that does that.

5183
04:55:47,680 --> 04:55:51,000
Like their entire identity is just Overwatch no matter what game they're in.

5184
04:55:51,200 --> 04:55:54,120
They put like, something something Overwatch.

5185
04:55:54,900 --> 04:55:56,880
And I think that's a little cringe, I'm sorry.

5186
04:56:04,240 --> 04:56:06,260
No other game does that.

5187
04:56:06,360 --> 04:56:07,800
It's literally just Overwatch.

5188
04:56:14,590 --> 04:56:16,010
Please, she's one!

5189
04:56:17,090 --> 04:56:18,030
Oh my god.

5190
04:56:25,350 --> 04:56:28,410
But that's the thing, that's what I'm saying.

5191
04:56:30,130 --> 04:56:33,550
Literally like, it's always Overwatch.

5192
04:56:39,570 --> 04:56:42,510
I've never seen any other game that does that.

5193
04:56:44,170 --> 04:56:46,070
There's a flanker somewhere.

5194
04:56:52,880 --> 04:56:54,440
Alright, let's...

5195
04:56:54,960 --> 04:56:55,480
Alright.

5196
04:57:01,440 --> 04:57:02,480
What?!

5197
04:57:04,020 --> 04:57:05,600
They hate us.

5198
04:57:06,020 --> 04:57:07,580
They hate us so much.

5199
04:57:13,360 --> 04:57:14,400
No.

5200
04:57:15,120 --> 04:57:15,940
No!

5201
04:57:16,700 --> 04:57:19,960
Why are the games harder?!

5202
04:57:19,960 --> 04:57:22,040
We're so close!

5203
04:57:29,380 --> 04:57:31,300
I want to tell people they're from Overwatch.

5204
04:57:31,480 --> 04:57:33,560
That makes me like, but why?

5205
04:57:35,760 --> 04:57:36,800
Why though?

5206
04:57:43,100 --> 04:57:46,780
But like, I'm sorry for anyone whose name is something something Overwatch.

5207
04:57:47,040 --> 04:57:48,220
But it's time to change your name.

5208
04:57:48,880 --> 04:57:50,340
It's been like, six years.

5209
04:57:50,700 --> 04:57:54,480
It's been six years, it's time to move on guys.

5210
04:57:57,140 --> 04:57:59,980
Yeah, but I didn't do like, Overwatch name.

5211
04:58:00,100 --> 04:58:01,140
I never did that.

5212
04:58:01,740 --> 04:58:03,000
I never...

5213
04:58:03,640 --> 04:58:05,840
I've never like, had that.

5214
04:58:14,090 --> 04:58:17,170
It's been six plus years, move on.

5215
04:58:19,850 --> 04:58:21,270
How do I put my... how do I emote?

5216
04:58:22,010 --> 04:58:23,130
Oh shit, sorry.

5217
04:58:25,050 --> 04:58:26,690
I didn't mean to emote now.

5218
04:58:27,410 --> 04:58:28,350
Okay, lock in.

5219
04:58:28,450 --> 04:58:29,130
We gotta lock in.

5220
04:58:29,290 --> 04:58:31,090
I can't keep playing this game.

5221
04:58:31,190 --> 04:58:33,210
I have actually... I didn't think it'd take this long.

5222
04:58:35,810 --> 04:58:37,970
I legitimately didn't think that it'd take this long.

5223
04:58:41,950 --> 04:58:43,050
I'm locked in guys.

5224
04:58:43,390 --> 04:58:44,990
I'm super focused, it's time for real.

5225
04:58:53,030 --> 04:58:54,990
Are you ser... still?!

5226
04:58:57,730 --> 04:58:59,210
Oh yeah?!

5227
04:58:59,990 --> 04:59:02,090
Cause I am too!

5228
04:59:03,210 --> 04:59:04,950
That's fucking right, kill them.

5229
04:59:05,290 --> 04:59:06,930
Fucking kill them.

5230
04:59:07,630 --> 04:59:09,650
This is my show now.

5231
04:59:10,930 --> 04:59:12,090
It's time to kill.

5232
04:59:15,670 --> 04:59:16,370
Alright.

5233
04:59:19,870 --> 04:59:22,110
Heal, heal, heal, heal.

5234
04:59:22,390 --> 04:59:23,550
You can tell that I'm tired.

5235
04:59:26,390 --> 04:59:29,070
I'm getting tired now.

5236
04:59:33,250 --> 04:59:35,870
I didn't think it would take this long, that's the thing.

5237
04:59:36,890 --> 04:59:40,530
I didn't think... I didn't think we'd still be here.

5238
04:59:43,850 --> 04:59:45,090
Where did he go?

5239
04:59:46,030 --> 04:59:47,670
Where did Dr. Strange go?

5240
04:59:48,510 --> 04:59:50,370
But you're still alive, Mr. Strange?

5241
04:59:54,380 --> 04:59:55,280
My game is still alive.

5242
04:59:55,280 --> 04:59:57,380
Gamersups is wearing off guys, it's not good.

5243
04:59:58,140 --> 04:59:58,680
Oh no.

5244
05:00:00,740 --> 05:00:01,580
Where did he go?

5245
05:00:01,960 --> 05:00:02,600
Oh there you are.

5246
05:00:05,720 --> 05:00:09,380
It's good that I didn't finish my gamersups, I gotta drink some more.

5247
05:00:12,640 --> 05:00:15,660
No, how are you still putting shows on?

5248
05:00:16,400 --> 05:00:16,900
How?

5249
05:00:17,140 --> 05:00:21,280
How are you still putting on your stupid fucking show?!

5250
05:00:22,620 --> 05:00:24,720
Fucking bitch, this is my show!

5251
05:00:24,720 --> 05:00:25,740
I'm streaming!

5252
05:00:28,220 --> 05:00:28,800
Okay.

5253
05:00:30,580 --> 05:00:31,160
Bye.

5254
05:00:32,980 --> 05:00:37,880
By the way, remember to use code DokiBird for 10% off your gamersups order.

5255
05:00:39,840 --> 05:00:41,840
I'm like, tweaking right now.

5256
05:00:47,600 --> 05:00:49,600
I'm sorry for people who have motion sickness.

5257
05:00:50,060 --> 05:00:51,400
I'm actually so locked in.

5258
05:00:54,020 --> 05:00:55,880
This is so good, that's insane!

5259
05:00:56,000 --> 05:00:57,240
That's an insane ult!

5260
05:00:59,940 --> 05:01:01,600
Oh my god!

5261
05:01:01,740 --> 05:01:03,720
That was an insane ult!

5262
05:01:04,080 --> 05:01:04,560
Holy shit!

5263
05:01:05,740 --> 05:01:07,560
What the fuck?!

5264
05:01:09,500 --> 05:01:10,380
That ult was crazy!

5265
05:01:12,780 --> 05:01:14,860
That was a crazy ult!

5266
05:01:19,710 --> 05:01:21,170
I told you I'm locked in.

5267
05:01:21,490 --> 05:01:23,270
Guys, I'm so locked in.

5268
05:01:24,290 --> 05:01:26,050
I didn't think this was going to be a very long stream.

5269
05:01:26,050 --> 05:01:26,810
I'm not going to lie.

5270
05:01:26,970 --> 05:01:31,150
I legitimately did not think this was going to be a long stream.

5271
05:01:32,290 --> 05:01:36,450
I thought we were going to make it.

5272
05:01:41,130 --> 05:01:46,670
I think if one of our games was not fucking thrown, we would have won it.

5273
05:01:46,870 --> 05:01:47,810
Oh, that's funny.

5274
05:01:49,630 --> 05:01:50,670
Say hi.

5275
05:01:50,810 --> 05:01:51,730
I didn't know that.

5276
05:01:53,430 --> 05:01:53,910
Hello.

5277
05:01:54,490 --> 05:01:55,050
Get out of here.

5278
05:01:55,170 --> 05:01:57,510
Can I freeze her?

5279
05:01:59,390 --> 05:02:00,870
Oh, she was distracted.

5280
05:02:07,490 --> 05:02:08,550
Alright, let's see.

5281
05:02:10,570 --> 05:02:11,790
Okay, lock in.

5282
05:02:11,830 --> 05:02:12,490
Lock in, Doki.

5283
05:02:12,630 --> 05:02:13,110
Lock in.

5284
05:02:13,290 --> 05:02:15,590
If you win this, you just need three wins.

5285
05:02:20,720 --> 05:02:22,840
You just need three wins if you win this one.

5286
05:02:24,500 --> 05:02:25,720
That's not too difficult.

5287
05:02:25,720 --> 05:02:26,660
Lock in.

5288
05:02:26,920 --> 05:02:27,160
Lock in.

5289
05:02:31,770 --> 05:02:32,930
Yes,

5290
05:02:37,230 --> 05:02:39,750
I'm ready to put on a show.

5291
05:02:40,510 --> 05:02:42,070
That's fucking right.

5292
05:02:43,010 --> 05:02:44,570
I'm dancing.

5293
05:02:47,410 --> 05:02:48,390
I'm leaving.

5294
05:02:51,230 --> 05:02:53,550
Dancing over now.

5295
05:02:55,610 --> 05:02:58,150
Dancing very over.

5296
05:03:03,380 --> 05:03:03,620
Whoa.

5297
05:03:03,980 --> 05:03:04,160
Whoa.

5298
05:03:04,860 --> 05:03:05,340
What?

5299
05:03:06,140 --> 05:03:07,400
I didn't see this kill cam.

5300
05:03:08,700 --> 05:03:10,040
Was he even aiming for me?

5301
05:03:11,180 --> 05:03:12,100
Jesus Christ.

5302
05:03:12,240 --> 05:03:13,140
Okay, yeah, he was.

5303
05:03:13,360 --> 05:03:14,860
Okay, you deserve that kill.

5304
05:03:15,400 --> 05:03:16,740
Oh my god, you deserve that.

5305
05:03:18,380 --> 05:03:19,880
You actually deserve that.

5306
05:03:19,960 --> 05:03:21,940
That was a really good shot.

5307
05:03:27,270 --> 05:03:29,790
That was a really, really good shot by him.

5308
05:03:30,710 --> 05:03:32,890
His aim was actually top 500 right there.

5309
05:03:36,320 --> 05:03:37,540
I actually hit somebody.

5310
05:03:39,020 --> 05:03:39,400
Nice.

5311
05:03:42,760 --> 05:03:43,900
Oh shit, let's go.

5312
05:03:44,640 --> 05:03:45,640
Fucking party.

5313
05:03:47,420 --> 05:03:48,980
No, hella mains are definitely really scary.

5314
05:03:49,180 --> 05:03:49,620
No, I agree.

5315
05:03:51,120 --> 05:03:53,260
I think they have Luna ult.

5316
05:03:54,600 --> 05:03:55,260
For sure.

5317
05:03:56,240 --> 05:03:57,400
Wait, how the fuck did he die?

5318
05:04:02,170 --> 05:04:03,990
I'm trying not to...

5319
05:04:06,270 --> 05:04:06,790
Uh...

5320
05:04:08,670 --> 05:04:10,510
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.

5321
05:04:14,270 --> 05:04:14,650
Okay.

5322
05:04:15,870 --> 05:04:16,910
Oh shit.

5323
05:04:18,030 --> 05:04:19,170
Oh my god.

5324
05:04:19,310 --> 05:04:20,230
That was insane.

5325
05:04:21,070 --> 05:04:21,550
No.

5326
05:04:23,470 --> 05:04:24,890
Oh my god, he's learning Spiderman.

5327
05:04:25,110 --> 05:04:25,430
Wait.

5328
05:04:27,610 --> 05:04:28,990
Okay, nevermind.

5329
05:04:29,410 --> 05:04:31,990
I was gonna be like, oh my god, he's gonna learn Spiderman too?

5330
05:04:33,310 --> 05:04:35,330
That was a really good ult by...

5331
05:04:35,330 --> 05:04:37,050
Moon Knight.

5332
05:04:37,990 --> 05:04:39,210
I have ult soon too.

5333
05:04:56,380 --> 05:04:59,880
Because we're gonna start putting a show!

5334
05:05:04,860 --> 05:05:06,000
Guys, I'm fucking leaving.

5335
05:05:06,120 --> 05:05:06,560
Good luck.

5336
05:05:07,320 --> 05:05:08,820
Good fucking luck.

5337
05:05:12,140 --> 05:05:13,280
Be nice.

5338
05:05:15,280 --> 05:05:16,620
Dr. Strange is here?

5339
05:05:17,320 --> 05:05:17,740
Yeah!

5340
05:05:18,440 --> 05:05:19,620
Oh my god, three more wins.

5341
05:05:21,960 --> 05:05:22,600
Please.

5342
05:05:24,000 --> 05:05:25,320
Please, they're so there.

5343
05:05:25,600 --> 05:05:26,580
I just need three more.

5344
05:05:27,300 --> 05:05:28,540
Oh my god.

5345
05:05:30,260 --> 05:05:32,420
I just need three more wins.

5346
05:05:34,440 --> 05:05:35,720
Moon Knight.

5347
05:05:36,280 --> 05:05:37,260
Fucking life.

5348
05:05:37,860 --> 05:05:38,300
What?

5349
05:05:38,300 --> 05:05:38,720
What?

5350
05:05:42,900 --> 05:05:45,300
Oh my god, surely I win three in a row, right?

5351
05:05:45,600 --> 05:05:47,480
Surely, I win three in a row, right?

5352
05:05:52,040 --> 05:05:53,000
Surely, right?

5353
05:05:57,500 --> 05:05:57,940
Right?

5354
05:05:58,500 --> 05:06:00,200
We can do this, right guys?

5355
05:06:00,880 --> 05:06:01,320
No!

5356
05:06:02,700 --> 05:06:03,140
Okay.

5357
05:06:04,360 --> 05:06:05,240
Oh my god, it's over.

5358
05:06:05,340 --> 05:06:06,180
It's the same team.

5359
05:06:11,460 --> 05:06:11,860
Okay.

5360
05:06:12,980 --> 05:06:13,840
Paladin, thank you for the super chat.

5361
05:06:13,960 --> 05:06:14,420
Thank you, thank you.

5362
05:06:14,440 --> 05:06:17,540
But less than 14 spots in the top 500.

5363
05:06:17,800 --> 05:06:18,540
Tier 1.

5364
05:06:18,680 --> 05:06:20,100
The rest are tier 2 and above.

5365
05:06:20,200 --> 05:06:22,220
It keeps going up every 10 minutes.

5366
05:06:24,360 --> 05:06:24,940
It's okay.

5367
05:06:25,240 --> 05:06:25,680
It's okay.

5368
05:06:26,040 --> 05:06:27,260
It's tier 2 or 3.

5369
05:06:27,460 --> 05:06:27,800
It's okay.

5370
05:06:28,040 --> 05:06:28,380
It's okay.

5371
05:06:28,860 --> 05:06:29,420
Three wins.

5372
05:06:29,560 --> 05:06:30,080
Three wins.

5373
05:06:30,180 --> 05:06:31,840
We can get this in three wins, guys.

5374
05:06:32,460 --> 05:06:33,520
Oh my god, it's possible.

5375
05:06:34,180 --> 05:06:35,820
Greg, thank you for the super chat.

5376
05:06:35,900 --> 05:06:36,620
Thank you, thank you.

5377
05:06:36,620 --> 05:06:37,940
Greg, thank you for the super chat.

5378
05:06:38,040 --> 05:06:40,140
Thank you, thank you for the super chat.

5379
05:06:40,940 --> 05:06:42,480
Just started watching you recently...

5380
05:06:42,480 --> 05:06:44,400
and really enjoyed your content.

5381
05:06:44,560 --> 05:06:45,140
It's all amazing.

5382
05:06:45,260 --> 05:06:45,880
Keep being great.

5383
05:06:46,040 --> 05:06:48,000
Much love from down under, Australia.

5384
05:06:48,180 --> 05:06:49,580
Thank you for the super chat.

5385
05:06:49,720 --> 05:06:50,360
Thank you, thank you.

5386
05:06:50,920 --> 05:06:52,380
I really appreciate it.

5387
05:06:53,560 --> 05:06:54,920
Thank you so much.

5388
05:06:56,300 --> 05:06:59,000
I can't believe I streamed so long that people in Australia are watching now.

5389
05:07:00,240 --> 05:07:01,920
That's how late I stream.

5390
05:07:13,390 --> 05:07:13,870
That's how late I stream.

5391
05:07:15,310 --> 05:07:16,370
Gonna do this.

5392
05:07:20,250 --> 05:07:21,330
I need that spot.

5393
05:07:21,870 --> 05:07:23,250
I need that spot.

5394
05:07:26,130 --> 05:07:28,790
I need that spot and then I can relax.

5395
05:07:29,230 --> 05:07:32,070
Because now the goal is just to end top 500 after that.

5396
05:07:32,650 --> 05:07:33,930
Then I don't need to try as hard.

5397
05:07:35,650 --> 05:07:37,670
Because I just need to end at that point.

5398
05:07:37,670 --> 05:07:40,670
Because I just want to get it on stream.

5399
05:07:41,950 --> 05:07:43,310
What the fuck?

5400
05:07:43,850 --> 05:07:44,590
Oh my god.

5401
05:07:44,950 --> 05:07:45,530
Guys.

5402
05:07:47,310 --> 05:07:47,970
Guys.

5403
05:07:48,950 --> 05:07:50,250
Guys, we're friends.

5404
05:07:50,770 --> 05:07:52,250
We're all friends.

5405
05:07:54,450 --> 05:07:56,430
How the fuck did we live?

5406
05:07:56,870 --> 05:07:58,170
What the fuck?

5407
05:07:58,710 --> 05:08:00,330
Oh my god, we're in what?

5408
05:08:02,470 --> 05:08:04,730
I don't know how that hat worked.

5409
05:08:07,670 --> 05:08:09,830
Same map, same team, awesome.

5410
05:08:14,120 --> 05:08:16,600
How the fuck did we win that?

5411
05:08:16,960 --> 05:08:19,720
How am I alive?

5412
05:08:20,500 --> 05:08:25,000
I should not be alive right now.

5413
05:08:25,920 --> 05:08:27,320
I legitimately should not be alive.

5414
05:08:27,700 --> 05:08:28,740
After everything I went through.

5415
05:08:36,080 --> 05:08:37,840
Guys, I'm on point.

5416
05:08:41,860 --> 05:08:43,980
Oh my god, that was okay.

5417
05:08:43,980 --> 05:08:46,300
Alright, but come on.

5418
05:08:46,400 --> 05:08:47,200
Was that not crazy?

5419
05:08:47,680 --> 05:08:50,820
Come on, was that not a crazy play I just did right there?

5420
05:08:53,540 --> 05:08:56,220
I'm so used to flankers now.

5421
05:08:56,800 --> 05:08:58,040
I swear to god.

5422
05:08:58,700 --> 05:09:01,200
All I do is get flanked these days.

5423
05:09:01,340 --> 05:09:02,840
That is just reflex now.

5424
05:09:07,180 --> 05:09:08,400
That's fucking right.

5425
05:09:08,940 --> 05:09:09,220
Whoops.

5426
05:09:11,100 --> 05:09:12,800
Don't worry, you are not okay.

5427
05:09:12,800 --> 05:09:15,380
You are definitely not okay.

5428
05:09:18,490 --> 05:09:20,120
Gather the Lucio!

5429
05:09:22,800 --> 05:09:24,000
That's fine.

5430
05:09:24,640 --> 05:09:27,800
Because then after this, we do this.

5431
05:09:28,280 --> 05:09:31,820
Because it's my turn to put on a show.

5432
05:09:32,260 --> 05:09:35,180
Because I know it's ending soon.

5433
05:09:36,420 --> 05:09:38,580
That's fucking right.

5434
05:09:38,580 --> 05:09:39,240
Alright.

5435
05:09:40,360 --> 05:09:41,620
My show first.

5436
05:09:45,400 --> 05:09:47,040
There we go.

5437
05:09:49,600 --> 05:09:50,840
After this is two more wins.

5438
05:09:50,940 --> 05:09:52,340
After this is two more wins, guys.

5439
05:09:53,040 --> 05:09:54,000
Can I heal from this?

5440
05:09:56,960 --> 05:09:57,580
Right here.

5441
05:09:58,960 --> 05:09:59,700
1 HP!

5442
05:10:00,680 --> 05:10:01,240
Nice.

5443
05:10:04,380 --> 05:10:05,900
Oh my god.

5444
05:10:06,860 --> 05:10:08,240
After this is two more wins.

5445
05:10:08,240 --> 05:10:09,720
After this is two more wins.

5446
05:10:09,840 --> 05:10:11,180
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon.

5447
05:10:11,800 --> 05:10:12,420
C'mon!

5448
05:10:18,970 --> 05:10:19,590
C'mon.

5449
05:10:19,790 --> 05:10:21,130
Fucking footsteps.

5450
05:10:25,750 --> 05:10:27,230
It's like they forgot.

5451
05:10:27,650 --> 05:10:28,790
People make footsteps.

5452
05:10:33,090 --> 05:10:34,830
Hope we get to farm this team again.

5453
05:10:36,190 --> 05:10:37,310
Oh, I already had dinner.

5454
05:10:38,730 --> 05:10:39,130
Technically...

5455
05:10:39,130 --> 05:10:39,770
Okay, to be fair.

5456
05:10:40,390 --> 05:10:42,490
Technically, I had lunch dinner.

5457
05:10:42,670 --> 05:10:44,270
I ate like one meal today.

5458
05:10:44,530 --> 05:10:46,070
But it was a really big meal.

5459
05:10:46,190 --> 05:10:47,050
I made myself pasta!

5460
05:10:48,810 --> 05:10:50,930
I actually put too many spaghetti in there.

5461
05:10:50,970 --> 05:10:56,390
Because you know when you boil spaghetti, you don't know how much it actually is until it's done.

5462
05:10:56,790 --> 05:10:59,610
I picked it up and I was like, that seems enough.

5463
05:10:59,690 --> 05:11:01,030
And it was a lot of pasta.

5464
05:11:01,190 --> 05:11:01,770
I ate all of it.

5465
05:11:02,990 --> 05:11:03,530
I ate all of it.

5466
05:11:07,440 --> 05:11:09,280
So like, I'm not hungry at all.

5467
05:11:09,340 --> 05:11:10,440
Because I ate way too much.

5468
05:11:10,780 --> 05:11:13,920
And I ate at like 4pm.

5469
05:11:13,960 --> 05:11:15,140
Because I cooked at 4pm.

5470
05:11:15,520 --> 05:11:17,680
Because I had to do work stuff.

5471
05:11:18,960 --> 05:11:19,440
Um...

5472
05:11:19,440 --> 05:11:20,160
Oh shit, okay.

5473
05:11:20,940 --> 05:11:21,320
It's time.

5474
05:11:24,080 --> 05:11:28,860
What if I just messaged surefour and be like, haha, two more...

5475
05:11:30,200 --> 05:11:32,460
Two more wins to top 500.

5476
05:11:33,560 --> 05:11:33,980
Haha.

5477
05:11:36,120 --> 05:11:40,820
You think he'll like, he'll like make sure he won't troll the last two games?

5478
05:11:41,440 --> 05:11:43,700
For me, like...

5479
05:11:43,700 --> 05:11:47,460
Or, if me saying that is gonna make him troll.

5480
05:11:47,940 --> 05:11:49,120
Like, that's the thing.

5481
05:11:49,240 --> 05:11:52,240
I don't know if I should say it or not.

5482
05:11:52,960 --> 05:11:57,240
Yeah, I'm just like, if I say it, do you think he'll start throwing?

5483
05:11:57,660 --> 05:11:58,660
HOLY SHIT!

5484
05:11:58,660 --> 05:11:59,940
BLEEEEHHHHHH!

5485
05:11:59,940 --> 05:12:00,420
HAHAHA!

5486
05:12:01,060 --> 05:12:02,240
OH MY GOD!

5487
05:12:02,580 --> 05:12:03,980
OH MY GOD!

5488
05:12:05,100 --> 05:12:06,180
HOLY SHIT!

5489
05:12:06,400 --> 05:12:10,140
Okay, but like, I got at least like, you know.

5490
05:12:10,640 --> 05:12:12,980
I got the black panther!

5491
05:12:14,320 --> 05:12:15,040
HAHAHA!

5492
05:12:15,540 --> 05:12:16,260
Okay.

5493
05:12:16,480 --> 05:12:18,340
I got the black panther though.

5494
05:12:18,580 --> 05:12:19,540
At least.

5495
05:12:20,200 --> 05:12:22,480
That shit scared the holy fucks.

5496
05:12:23,520 --> 05:12:25,480
I was not expecting that.

5497
05:12:26,040 --> 05:12:28,040
I was like, what the fuck is...

5498
05:12:31,380 --> 05:12:32,940
That shit's skittish.

5499
05:12:33,160 --> 05:12:34,360
That was actually crazy.

5500
05:12:39,220 --> 05:12:39,740
Okay.

5501
05:12:40,560 --> 05:12:41,880
Oh nice, we got two!

5502
05:12:42,300 --> 05:12:43,260
We got Collat.

5503
05:12:46,040 --> 05:12:46,560
Okay.

5504
05:12:48,160 --> 05:12:53,080
The point of the thing is literally... I saw him, he was about to... it was like watching...

5505
05:12:53,720 --> 05:12:58,080
Uh, like seeing like a fucking, uh, uh...

5506
05:12:59,700 --> 05:13:03,220
Like a fucking FNAF jump scare right there.

5507
05:13:03,320 --> 05:13:04,960
That was, uh...

5508
05:13:10,180 --> 05:13:13,040
That scared... that scared me so much.

5509
05:13:13,820 --> 05:13:15,000
I was not ready for it.

5510
05:13:16,000 --> 05:13:18,480
It was like foxy jump scare right there.

5511
05:13:18,720 --> 05:13:20,280
That's what I was thinking, yeah.

5512
05:13:26,200 --> 05:13:28,400
Jesus Christ, he did not.

5513
05:13:30,900 --> 05:13:31,780
Okay, nice.

5514
05:13:38,050 --> 05:13:39,270
Well, he's retired.

5515
05:13:39,390 --> 05:13:40,230
He hasn't been a pro.

5516
05:13:40,410 --> 05:13:42,490
He's also 30, so he hasn't... sorry.

5517
05:13:45,570 --> 05:13:49,590
But you guys all know about like shelf life of pro players.

5518
05:13:50,950 --> 05:13:53,650
Pro players tend to retire very early.

5519
05:13:58,670 --> 05:13:59,870
That's crazy.

5520
05:14:03,650 --> 05:14:06,210
But he's also 30.

5521
05:14:09,390 --> 05:14:12,410
You can still be pro at 30, I think.

5522
05:14:13,370 --> 05:14:19,490
It's usually a lot of pros tend to like retire before, like when around that age.

5523
05:14:19,690 --> 05:14:23,690
Because like it's all like people are like, oh faster reflexes and stuff.

5524
05:14:23,690 --> 05:14:26,530
I know you're like, oh, but Shroud came back as a pro.

5525
05:14:26,730 --> 05:14:31,390
Yeah, but it was more so of like, I feel like it was more of an image.

5526
05:14:31,510 --> 05:14:32,790
Like, uh, what's the word called?

5527
05:14:33,030 --> 05:14:35,570
Like a publicity thing type deal.

5528
05:14:38,910 --> 05:14:44,670
When and usually like people who are around that age do better as content creators.

5529
05:14:44,810 --> 05:14:46,910
Then you make more as a content creator than you do as a pro.

5530
05:14:51,960 --> 05:15:03,480
It's like because a lot of them tend to go towards, uh, go towards, uh, content creation around that time.

5531
05:15:03,780 --> 05:15:04,920
And then you make more.

5532
05:15:05,320 --> 05:15:08,940
Pro playing is more about being competitive and just like, unless you play League.

5533
05:15:09,520 --> 05:15:11,620
Unless you're like the best team in League because like...

5534
05:15:15,320 --> 05:15:20,120
But other than that, other than that, it's just you just make more.

5535
05:15:20,200 --> 05:15:21,540
There's no reason to go back to pro.

5536
05:15:26,070 --> 05:15:26,730
Guys, stop.

5537
05:15:26,910 --> 05:15:27,270
Stop.

5538
05:15:27,610 --> 05:15:28,050
Stop.

5539
05:15:28,390 --> 05:15:30,250
Don't count the spots.

5540
05:15:30,350 --> 05:15:30,730
Stop.

5541
05:15:40,850 --> 05:15:44,210
I just want to be like, surprised.

5542
05:15:46,410 --> 05:15:49,410
You know, just be like, yay.

5543
05:15:50,950 --> 05:15:51,770
Let me use the bathroom.

5544
05:15:51,990 --> 05:15:52,330
I'll be right back.

5545

05:20:27,680 --> 05:20:29,260
What the fuck?

5579
05:20:30,260 --> 05:20:31,860
I am strengthened.

5580
05:20:32,500 --> 05:20:35,600
No, I have to reload my hands!

5581
05:20:36,120 --> 05:20:37,700
I'm sorry!

5582
05:20:39,620 --> 05:20:43,320
My hands couldn't be reloaded in time!

5583
05:20:49,160 --> 05:20:50,180
Let's go.

5584
05:20:50,280 --> 05:20:51,460
Let's fight this area.

5585
05:20:53,120 --> 05:20:54,180
We just stall.

5586
05:20:55,160 --> 05:20:56,580
We just keep stalling.

5587
05:20:57,580 --> 05:20:59,400
We just gotta stall.

5588
05:20:59,960 --> 05:21:00,520
Goodbye.

5589
05:21:05,990 --> 05:21:11,010
And of course, fuck me!

5590
05:21:11,690 --> 05:21:13,210
In the corner.

5591
05:21:13,910 --> 05:21:14,510
Wait, what?

5592
05:21:22,720 --> 05:21:26,100
I didn't realize I was rezzed.

5593
05:21:27,000 --> 05:21:29,420
I didn't realize I got rezzed there.

5594
05:21:31,100 --> 05:21:32,900
I got revived!

5595
05:21:32,900 --> 05:21:33,900
I got rezzed!

5596
05:21:34,620 --> 05:21:36,680
I couldn't... I didn't know!

5597
05:21:38,980 --> 05:21:40,640
I was like, what?

5598
05:21:41,040 --> 05:21:43,120
Am I alive?

5599
05:21:43,920 --> 05:21:45,680
I forgot about Rocky Raccoon's rez.

5600
05:21:51,370 --> 05:21:54,630
I think our... I just think our Captain America is not that great.

5601
05:21:57,950 --> 05:22:01,230
I think he's a little of a troll pick.

5602
05:22:04,090 --> 05:22:05,290
Unless like...

5603
05:22:05,290 --> 05:22:06,110
No, I missed!

5604
05:22:06,450 --> 05:22:06,870
I missed!

5605
05:22:07,130 --> 05:22:07,750
I missed!

5606
05:22:08,010 --> 05:22:08,450
No!

5607
05:22:08,910 --> 05:22:10,210
I missed!

5608
05:22:18,900 --> 05:22:20,880
Oh my god, Rocket, please keep them up!

5609
05:22:21,360 --> 05:22:22,740
Why is it always me?

5610
05:22:23,540 --> 05:22:25,940
Why is it always me?

5611
05:22:26,180 --> 05:22:27,260
I don't understand!

5612
05:22:28,340 --> 05:22:29,980
Just get away from me!

5613
05:22:37,240 --> 05:22:39,200
Oh yeah, definitely dead.

5614
05:22:40,320 --> 05:22:43,240
No, he's... yeah, he's definitely dead.

5615
05:22:47,810 --> 05:22:50,790
Oh please, I can't heal you up there.

5616
05:22:56,330 --> 05:22:58,090
Oh my god, he didn't like... oh, he's dead.

5617
05:22:58,590 --> 05:22:59,330
He's dead.

5618
05:22:59,930 --> 05:23:00,870
He unleashed it though.

5619
05:23:02,930 --> 05:23:03,890
He did the thing though.

5620
05:23:05,470 --> 05:23:06,910
He's reloading hands.

5621
05:23:16,560 --> 05:23:19,000
Oh, that's two people that got rezzed.

5622
05:23:21,580 --> 05:23:22,120
No!

5623
05:23:28,020 --> 05:23:28,960
Do I have ult?

5624
05:23:29,120 --> 05:23:30,040
I do, I do.

5625
05:23:30,540 --> 05:23:33,000
Okay, we have final fight and we have ult.

5626
05:23:37,760 --> 05:23:38,840
I am...

5627
05:23:38,840 --> 05:23:39,740
We gotta fight this.

5628
05:23:39,840 --> 05:23:40,900
We have to fight this.

5629
05:23:41,220 --> 05:23:44,180
Guys, just kill him.

5630
05:23:44,980 --> 05:23:46,360
Just kill him.

5631
05:23:47,100 --> 05:23:48,380
That's... just kill...

5632
05:23:48,380 --> 05:23:48,740
No!

5633
05:23:57,980 --> 05:23:58,880
I'm sorry.

5634
05:23:59,560 --> 05:24:00,440
I'm trying.

5635
05:24:01,060 --> 05:24:02,160
I'm trying.

5636
05:24:03,180 --> 05:24:05,820
I'm trying to keep you up, bro.

5637
05:24:06,940 --> 05:24:08,340
I can't.

5638
05:24:08,340 --> 05:24:09,760
I can't keep you up, bro.

5639
05:24:16,900 --> 05:24:18,760
Alright, we're up there.

5640
05:24:20,520 --> 05:24:20,940
No!

5641
05:24:27,940 --> 05:24:30,920
Fucking slow-mo with the Magneto.

5642
05:24:31,380 --> 05:24:32,520
Oh my god.

5643
05:24:34,460 --> 05:24:35,480
Oh my god.

5644
05:24:35,540 --> 05:24:35,800
No.

5645
05:24:36,700 --> 05:24:37,140
No.

5646
05:24:37,960 --> 05:24:39,100
I wanted two more.

5647
05:24:41,560 --> 05:24:42,460
Oh my god.

5648
05:24:43,520 --> 05:24:45,940
I just needed two more.

5649
05:24:50,260 --> 05:24:53,660
I just think it's... I think it's Captain America.

5650
05:24:54,160 --> 05:24:56,680
I honestly legitimately think...

5651
05:24:56,680 --> 05:24:59,420
Captain America is not the right pick for our tank.

5652
05:25:00,380 --> 05:25:03,480
Maybe he's like the best fucking Captain America on our team.

5653
05:25:03,920 --> 05:25:04,740
Like, ever.

5654
05:25:05,000 --> 05:25:07,280
But I just don't think he's the right pick against that comp.

5655
05:25:17,880 --> 05:25:19,700
He's playing for Captain America in this elo?

5656
05:25:19,920 --> 05:25:21,880
Does he use the fucking Captain America one-trick?

5657
05:25:23,540 --> 05:25:26,980
Like, I barely ever see Captain America in general.

5658
05:25:31,840 --> 05:25:32,360
Yeah.

5659
05:25:33,040 --> 05:25:36,480
Yeah, I heard he's like one of the... He's like a D-tier tank.

5660
05:25:39,380 --> 05:25:44,160
But at least... Hey, I might be a one-trick, but I'm an A-tier one-trick, guys.

5661
05:25:46,420 --> 05:25:48,200
My support is A-tier.

5662
05:25:48,480 --> 05:25:51,000
So like, she's not S-tier because that's Mantis.

5663
05:25:52,280 --> 05:25:52,800
But...

5664
05:25:52,800 --> 05:25:54,460
But she's A-tier.

5665
05:25:54,720 --> 05:25:55,980
And that's good enough.

5666
05:25:56,800 --> 05:25:57,360
Oh.

5667
05:25:58,880 --> 05:26:00,680
At least it's not D-tier.

5668
05:26:10,810 --> 05:26:11,850
You're fine.

5669
05:26:12,150 --> 05:26:12,890
Stop complaining.

5670
05:26:16,750 --> 05:26:21,710
Oh my god.

5671
05:26:22,650 --> 05:26:23,530
This elo.

5672
05:26:29,540 --> 05:26:30,660
Oh,

5673
05:26:35,200 --> 05:26:35,520
nice.

5674
05:26:39,430 --> 05:26:41,090
Oh, I thought they'd be closer.

5675
05:26:44,980 --> 05:26:46,020
Please, please heal me.

5676
05:26:46,580 --> 05:26:47,080
Thank you.

5677
05:26:49,060 --> 05:26:50,520
Oh, guys, guys.

5678
05:26:50,580 --> 05:26:52,100
I can't heal you guys up there.

5679
05:26:59,640 --> 05:27:00,120
Guys.

5680
05:27:00,780 --> 05:27:03,000
I can't heal you guys up there, guys.

5681
05:27:03,160 --> 05:27:05,120
I need you guys to know that when you're...

5682
05:27:05,120 --> 05:27:06,740
When you're on high ground.

5683
05:27:06,960 --> 05:27:07,840
Oh my god.

5684
05:27:12,360 --> 05:27:13,620
I have Iron Man?

5685
05:27:17,840 --> 05:27:19,160
Guys, I have to look up.

5686
05:27:19,320 --> 05:27:20,940
This is... I'm fucking giving him the thing.

5687
05:27:21,000 --> 05:27:21,740
I don't want to look up.

5688
05:27:24,560 --> 05:27:25,360
I'm tired.

5689
05:27:25,480 --> 05:27:30,040
I'm tired of looking up, so I'm giving this to him so I never have to look up again.

5690
05:27:32,840 --> 05:27:33,520
Fuck this.

5691
05:27:33,580 --> 05:27:34,300
I'm using it.

5692
05:27:35,560 --> 05:27:36,680
I'm using it.

5693
05:27:37,860 --> 05:27:39,700
I should use it when I get a pick.

5694
05:27:43,500 --> 05:27:44,660
This is it.

5695
05:27:44,960 --> 05:27:45,440
Oh.

5696
05:27:46,140 --> 05:27:46,720
Attack!

5697
05:27:47,720 --> 05:27:48,380
Attack!

5698
05:27:51,480 --> 05:27:52,140
How?

5699
05:27:52,620 --> 05:27:53,280
Okay.

5700
05:27:57,520 --> 05:27:58,380
It's okay.

5701
05:27:58,440 --> 05:27:59,180
We pushed it up.

5702
05:27:59,400 --> 05:28:00,800
Alright, I'm backing out now.

5703
05:28:01,400 --> 05:28:01,880
Alright.

5704
05:28:02,860 --> 05:28:05,080
That's a scary ult right there.

5705
05:28:05,080 --> 05:28:05,200
Alright.

5706
05:28:05,320 --> 05:28:05,320
Oh.

5707
05:28:08,280 --> 05:28:10,880
I think it's like DPS tanked it.

5708
05:28:11,040 --> 05:28:11,740
I'm not gonna lie.

5709
05:28:13,900 --> 05:28:14,340
Okay.

5710
05:28:17,950 --> 05:28:18,910
Oh my god.

5711
05:28:19,230 --> 05:28:21,090
I legit didn't think... It's just a Captain America.

5712
05:28:21,970 --> 05:28:23,210
This is just not the right tank.

5713
05:28:39,210 --> 05:28:40,590
I fucking... Oh my god.

5714
05:28:40,610 --> 05:28:42,310
I could hear the footsteps too.

5715
05:28:42,530 --> 05:28:44,930
I heard the fucking footsteps!

5716
05:28:47,370 --> 05:28:48,630
I like looked up!

5717
05:28:49,430 --> 05:28:50,450
Yeah, okay.

5718
05:28:51,170 --> 05:28:52,030
Two more games.

5719
05:28:53,270 --> 05:28:53,470
Two.

5720
05:28:54,590 --> 05:28:55,850
We lose this.

5721
05:28:56,450 --> 05:28:57,370
Two more games.

5722
05:28:58,050 --> 05:28:59,810
No, three more games.

5723
05:29:00,250 --> 05:29:01,230
Three more games.

5724
05:29:03,250 --> 05:29:04,790
So close.

5725
05:29:06,110 --> 05:29:07,630
So close!

5726
05:29:09,470 --> 05:29:10,910
What the fuck?

5727
05:29:12,030 --> 05:29:12,310
Okay.

5728
05:29:28,020 --> 05:29:28,460
Guys.

5729
05:29:29,680 --> 05:29:31,180
Guys, I don't think this is it.

5730
05:29:31,260 --> 05:29:31,580
Guys.

5731
05:29:33,540 --> 05:29:36,640
At best, I can stay here and beat up all his cover down.

5732
05:29:37,200 --> 05:29:37,980
Fuck your covers!

5733
05:29:41,020 --> 05:29:41,620
That's right!

5734
05:29:41,680 --> 05:29:42,260
No covers!

5735
05:29:42,460 --> 05:29:43,360
Oh shit!

5736
05:29:44,620 --> 05:29:45,200
Sorry bro.

5737
05:29:45,400 --> 05:29:46,060
You got headshot.

5738
05:29:46,260 --> 05:29:47,500
Oh my god!

5739
05:30:10,420 --> 05:30:11,420
Guys.

5740
05:30:11,720 --> 05:30:13,700
Gather around, guys.

5741
05:30:15,080 --> 05:30:15,760
Guys.

5742
05:30:16,960 --> 05:30:19,260
Guys, gather around, guys.

5743
05:30:22,000 --> 05:30:23,920
Guys, it's time.

5744
05:30:28,120 --> 05:30:30,760
I'm putting on a show, guys.

5745
05:30:30,760 --> 05:30:33,300
Guys, gather around, guys.

5746
05:30:34,500 --> 05:30:41,080
Guys, if you want heals, you gotta stay on the point because that's the only way you're gonna...

5747
05:30:41,080 --> 05:30:41,780
Oh my god.

5748
05:30:42,800 --> 05:30:43,980
Oh yes!

5749
05:30:45,480 --> 05:30:46,880
No, there's no hope.

5750
05:30:47,920 --> 05:30:49,480
There's no hope.

5751
05:30:49,900 --> 05:30:52,280
There was no hope in that game.

5752
05:30:53,820 --> 05:30:57,640
That game was a full team dip right there.

5753
05:30:58,480 --> 05:30:59,520
Oh my god.

5754
05:31:02,940 --> 05:31:05,560
I'm just gonna... I don't know if he's avoiding...

5755
05:31:05,560 --> 05:31:08,340
I don't know if he's avoiding...

5756
05:31:11,100 --> 05:31:12,640
Oh my god.

5757
05:31:15,320 --> 05:31:16,800
I'm gonna avoid him.

5758
05:31:16,920 --> 05:31:19,580
I just don't think Captain America is the pick here.

5759
05:31:23,360 --> 05:31:24,960
What is his profile anyway?

5760
05:31:25,940 --> 05:31:29,320
Oh, I can't... I'm avoiding just because I don't think Captain America was the pick.

5761
05:31:30,240 --> 05:31:33,120
And now avoiding him because he was DPS too.

5762
05:31:34,160 --> 05:31:34,600
Oh.

5763
05:31:36,260 --> 05:31:36,940
No.

5764
05:31:37,720 --> 05:31:40,460
I need to avoid him because, okay, we gotta...

5765
05:31:40,460 --> 05:31:41,900
We gotta fix our settings.

5766
05:31:44,240 --> 05:31:46,160
Oh, is he GG's?

5767
05:31:46,220 --> 05:31:47,780
Okay, GG's, man.

5768
05:31:48,580 --> 05:31:51,100
Alright, thanks for games.

5769
05:31:51,780 --> 05:31:54,320
Alright, here we go.

5770
05:31:56,440 --> 05:31:57,860
Oh my god.

5771
05:31:59,320 --> 05:32:00,800
Okay, we can do this.

5772
05:32:00,920 --> 05:32:02,460
We can fucking do this.

5773
05:32:02,540 --> 05:32:04,920
Okay, I gotta adjust my avoids.

5774
05:32:05,320 --> 05:32:07,320
I gotta... I gotta...

5775
05:32:08,100 --> 05:32:10,040
Wait, how do I adjust my avoids though?

5776
05:32:12,140 --> 05:32:12,740
Alright.

5777
05:32:15,080 --> 05:32:16,180
How do I leave?

5778
05:32:17,560 --> 05:32:18,220
Oh, leave.

5779
05:32:22,170 --> 05:32:22,770
Alright.

5780
05:32:23,250 --> 05:32:24,930
We just need three games.

5781
05:32:27,410 --> 05:32:28,510
Three games.

5782
05:32:29,290 --> 05:32:30,990
Three fucking games.

5783
05:32:31,870 --> 05:32:33,670
Three fucking games.

5784
05:32:36,870 --> 05:32:38,050
Oh my god.

5785
05:32:38,810 --> 05:32:39,510
Come on.

5786
05:32:40,070 --> 05:32:41,190
We might be lucky.

5787
05:32:42,430 --> 05:32:43,710
We can be lucky.

5788
05:32:43,910 --> 05:32:44,830
I believe in us.

5789
05:32:46,870 --> 05:32:47,650
We'll be lucky.

5790
05:32:49,110 --> 05:32:50,330
There's no way.

5791
05:32:54,530 --> 05:32:56,090
There's no... We can be lucky.

5792
05:32:56,250 --> 05:32:57,110
I believe in us.

5793
05:32:57,810 --> 05:32:58,370
Come on.

5794
05:32:58,690 --> 05:32:59,750
We can be lucky.

5795
05:33:04,970 --> 05:33:05,970
There's no way.

5796
05:33:06,630 --> 05:33:08,250
There's... Wait, is this the Necros?

5797
05:33:10,930 --> 05:33:12,650
Wait, how is... Why is he in this elo?

5798
05:33:12,970 --> 05:33:13,990
Does he make another count?

5799
05:33:16,470 --> 05:33:17,390
There's no way.

5800
05:33:17,530 --> 05:33:18,350
That can't be him.

5801
05:33:18,430 --> 05:33:21,130
He's literally top 50.

5802
05:33:22,090 --> 05:33:23,010
There's no way.

5803
05:33:23,090 --> 05:33:24,650
He's top 50 right now.

5804
05:33:27,090 --> 05:33:27,530
What?

5805
05:33:27,530 --> 05:33:27,670
What?

5806
05:33:29,650 --> 05:33:31,110
Isn't he top 50?

5807
05:33:32,150 --> 05:33:35,470
Oh shit, he's... Wait, is he on an ult count?

5808
05:33:41,720 --> 05:33:43,140
Oh my god, it is him.

5809
05:33:43,220 --> 05:33:44,260
Wait, is he on an ult count?

5810
05:33:45,500 --> 05:33:47,920
Alright Necros, you get this.

5811
05:33:49,100 --> 05:33:50,400
You get this.

5812
05:33:52,800 --> 05:33:55,560
You get this, Necros.

5813
05:33:57,560 --> 05:33:59,360
Yeah, he's a...

5814
05:34:00,920 --> 05:34:07,240
He's the Genji main and who's the...

5815
05:34:07,240 --> 05:34:07,940
434?

5816
05:34:08,400 --> 05:34:09,480
Wait, he's not?

5817
05:34:10,220 --> 05:34:11,740
Wait, what's his win rate?

5818
05:34:12,360 --> 05:34:13,380
Wait a minute.

5819
05:34:16,100 --> 05:34:17,880
Wait a minute.

5820
05:34:18,040 --> 05:34:20,820
He's been playing this game for a long time.

5821
05:34:21,480 --> 05:34:23,520
What's his win rate?

5822
05:34:23,520 --> 05:34:24,820
I'm a little...

5823
05:34:28,080 --> 05:34:32,120
I'm a little worried because he's been here for a while now.

5824
05:34:41,140 --> 05:34:44,560
Bro, you're taking so much damage, man.

5825
05:34:55,720 --> 05:34:56,860
Oh my god.

5826
05:34:59,460 --> 05:35:00,720
Oh, it's when he started?

5827
05:35:00,960 --> 05:35:01,260
Okay.

5828
05:35:01,600 --> 05:35:02,900
Okay, that's not bad.

5829
05:35:03,460 --> 05:35:04,260
That's not bad.

5830
05:35:04,360 --> 05:35:07,000
Okay, I got a little worried because you guys were like...

5831
05:35:07,400 --> 05:35:11,620
You guys were like, he's ranked 43, 434 and I was like, there's no way.

5832
05:35:12,640 --> 05:35:14,160
Or maybe he started late.

5833
05:35:16,160 --> 05:35:18,400
Because I thought he would be diving already, you know?

5834
05:35:18,480 --> 05:35:19,580
Because he's been playing for a while.

5835
05:35:20,380 --> 05:35:21,740
That's why I wasn't expecting it.

5836
05:35:26,260 --> 05:35:27,360
See, I told you guys.

5837
05:35:27,460 --> 05:35:28,720
It's all about the gotcha.

5838
05:35:30,200 --> 05:35:31,400
Oh, that was not what I wanted.

5839
05:35:36,580 --> 05:35:37,140
Nice.

5840
05:35:41,240 --> 05:35:42,300
Let's go!

5841
05:35:42,520 --> 05:35:43,900
Let's fucking go in!

5842
05:35:44,760 --> 05:35:45,740
Go in!

5843
05:35:46,660 --> 05:35:47,980
Oh my god, don't go in.

5844
05:35:48,100 --> 05:35:48,780
Don't go in.

5845
05:35:49,060 --> 05:35:49,940
Don't go in.

5846
05:35:50,140 --> 05:35:51,220
Don't go in.

5847
05:35:54,000 --> 05:35:55,200
Don't go in.

5848
05:35:57,180 --> 05:35:58,300
Holy shit!

5849
05:36:03,420 --> 05:36:04,100
Nevermind.

5850
05:36:04,600 --> 05:36:06,600
He instant died.

5851
05:36:06,840 --> 05:36:08,900
Do not go in there.

5852
05:36:10,220 --> 05:36:13,240
I did not expect him to instant die, you know?

5853
05:36:21,100 --> 05:36:24,080
Oh, I missed a... I missed a...

5854
05:36:25,540 --> 05:36:28,560
Oh my god.

5855
05:36:30,860 --> 05:36:31,540
Sorry.

5856
05:36:32,180 --> 05:36:33,160
Can you reload my hands?

5857
05:36:33,240 --> 05:36:33,960
I'm so sorry.

5858
05:36:34,560 --> 05:36:36,220
Oh no, not again.

5859
05:36:37,900 --> 05:36:38,800
Oh no.

5860
05:36:39,640 --> 05:36:40,240
No!

5861
05:36:44,060 --> 05:36:45,160
They can win this.

5862
05:36:45,280 --> 05:36:45,760
They can win this.

5863
05:36:45,800 --> 05:36:46,580
They don't need healers.

5864
05:36:50,710 --> 05:36:52,090
I'm coming back.

5865
05:36:54,010 --> 05:36:54,610
No!

5866
05:37:09,530 --> 05:37:10,050
Okay.

5867
05:37:10,050 --> 05:37:11,010
Everything is fine.

5868
05:37:14,800 --> 05:37:15,320
See?

5869
05:37:15,460 --> 05:37:17,580
It's all about the gotcha!

5870
05:37:19,800 --> 05:37:20,540
Oh my god.

5871
05:37:20,800 --> 05:37:21,980
Bro, I'm gonna play against them.

5872
05:37:22,080 --> 05:37:23,720
They'll take back the elo they gave me.

5873
05:37:25,800 --> 05:37:27,260
I can feel it.

5874
05:37:28,740 --> 05:37:32,540
I'm gonna queue up and they'll take back the elo.

5875
05:37:36,160 --> 05:37:37,600
Knowing my luck.

5876
05:37:44,570 --> 05:37:45,230
Alright.

5877
05:37:45,790 --> 05:37:47,110
How many more games?

5878
05:37:47,410 --> 05:37:48,490
Three games.

5879
05:37:48,610 --> 05:37:50,470
If I win three in a row, I get diamond.

5880
05:37:51,150 --> 05:37:52,650
And then that secures top 500.

5881
05:37:53,590 --> 05:37:55,530
Because I don't think there's plat spots left.

5882
05:37:55,850 --> 05:37:57,850
I don't think there's plat spots.

5883
05:38:00,850 --> 05:38:01,610
Hahaha.

5884
05:38:06,130 --> 05:38:07,530
Oh my god.

5885
05:38:08,230 --> 05:38:09,310
We're so close.

5886
05:38:10,470 --> 05:38:10,890
Whee!

5887
05:38:12,310 --> 05:38:15,630
I don't think there's plat 1 spots left, guys.

5888
05:38:15,850 --> 05:38:18,070
I think it's just diamond 3.

5889
05:38:21,910 --> 05:38:24,310
There's no more plats at top 500.

5890
05:38:24,790 --> 05:38:27,150
I gotta be a diamond player.

5891
05:38:27,150 --> 05:38:27,290
Okay.

5892
05:38:32,660 --> 05:38:34,640
What the fuck is he doing?

5893
05:38:41,820 --> 05:38:42,640
Jesus Christ.

5894
05:38:43,760 --> 05:38:44,480
Keep fighting!

5895
05:38:44,700 --> 05:38:45,760
Keep punching, Hulk!

5896
05:38:51,400 --> 05:38:54,120
Oh my god, I have to do this!

5897
05:38:59,100 --> 05:38:59,760
Okay, nice.

5898
05:39:01,940 --> 05:39:02,820
We're fine.

5899
05:39:06,190 --> 05:39:06,750
Okay.

5900
05:39:07,570 --> 05:39:09,910
Oh my god, I'm trying so hard right now.

5901
05:39:10,010 --> 05:39:11,230
I'm actually so focused.

5902
05:39:12,130 --> 05:39:13,470
I need to get out of this.

5903
05:39:14,030 --> 05:39:15,810
I need this.

5904
05:39:15,950 --> 05:39:17,290
I need this so badly.

5905
05:39:19,990 --> 05:39:21,110
No, Hulk!

5906
05:39:22,410 --> 05:39:24,250
We'll keep you alive!

5907
05:39:25,350 --> 05:39:27,430
Build your ult charge back!

5908
05:39:28,290 --> 05:39:30,530
You're gonna live, you skinny boy!

5909
05:39:30,530 --> 05:39:32,990
You're gonna live!

5910
05:39:34,550 --> 05:39:35,910
He's alive.

5911
05:39:36,510 --> 05:39:38,350
Oh my god, no.

5912
05:39:38,590 --> 05:39:39,830
He actually lived.

5913
05:39:41,530 --> 05:39:43,690
We put all our resources on him.

5914
05:39:49,960 --> 05:39:51,340
Oh my god.

5915
05:39:52,180 --> 05:39:53,860
He actually lived.

5916
05:39:57,600 --> 05:39:58,700
It's okay.

5917
05:40:03,000 --> 05:40:05,380
He fucking lived to tell the tale.

5918
05:40:06,340 --> 05:40:09,540
Okay, guys, I don't know about this though.

5919
05:40:10,260 --> 05:40:11,020
Alright,

5920
05:40:16,140 --> 05:40:17,540
I'll just stay here.

5921
05:40:21,160 --> 05:40:21,920
Guys.

5922
05:40:22,220 --> 05:40:22,640
Guys.

5923
05:40:23,640 --> 05:40:24,400
Guys.

5924
05:40:27,420 --> 05:40:28,180
Whoa.

5925
05:40:29,620 --> 05:40:30,380
Guys.

5926
05:40:30,580 --> 05:40:32,100
Guys, we're a little... Guys.

5927
05:40:33,300 --> 05:40:34,060
Guys!

5928
05:40:38,200 --> 05:40:38,820
Guys!

5929
05:40:38,820 --> 05:40:39,360
Oh my god.

5930
05:40:42,780 --> 05:40:44,360
Oh my god, Hulk.

5931
05:40:44,520 --> 05:40:46,820
Hulk, you fucking... You madman!

5932
05:40:47,680 --> 05:40:49,120
You madman!

5933
05:40:51,960 --> 05:40:52,580
Wait.

5934
05:40:52,720 --> 05:40:53,240
Wait a minute.

5935
05:40:53,540 --> 05:40:53,820
Guys.

5936
05:40:54,140 --> 05:40:54,520
Guys.

5937
05:40:54,980 --> 05:40:55,940
Oh, shit.

5938
05:40:56,380 --> 05:40:56,800
Guys.

5939
05:40:57,140 --> 05:40:57,920
They made a portal.

5940
05:41:02,550 --> 05:41:04,250
Wait, they actually made a portal.

5941
05:41:04,470 --> 05:41:04,990
Holy fuck.

5942
05:41:06,810 --> 05:41:10,350
They made a portal to get away from us.

5943
05:41:11,230 --> 05:41:15,050
No, they literally made a portal to get away from us.

5944
05:41:15,130 --> 05:41:16,830
That's actually crazy.

5945
05:41:17,170 --> 05:41:18,050
That's so funny.

5946
05:41:22,410 --> 05:41:23,290
I'm like 1 HP.

5947
05:41:31,160 --> 05:41:32,580
How do I live this long?

5948
05:41:32,580 --> 05:41:32,760
Oh!

5949
05:41:35,060 --> 05:41:35,700
Shit!

5950
05:41:40,120 --> 05:41:40,760
Holy...

5951
05:41:40,760 --> 05:41:41,540
That's crazy.

5952
05:41:42,620 --> 05:41:44,140
That's crazy.

5953
05:41:49,420 --> 05:41:50,940
That was...

5954
05:41:51,480 --> 05:41:54,920
What I saw from the Hulk was...

5955
05:41:54,920 --> 05:42:00,040
I don't know.

5956
05:42:00,500 --> 05:42:02,340
I don't know how I'm alive, chat.

5957
05:42:02,860 --> 05:42:05,820
Guys, I'm ready to, like, lose this by facing Necros.

5958
05:42:06,420 --> 05:42:07,460
I'm so ready.

5959
05:42:09,160 --> 05:42:11,580
I'm so fucking ready.

5960
05:42:13,940 --> 05:42:14,940
Alright.

5961
05:42:17,180 --> 05:42:18,500
Two more.

5962
05:42:19,860 --> 05:42:20,620
Two more.

5963
05:42:21,480 --> 05:42:23,040
Two fucking more, guys.

5964
05:42:23,560 --> 05:42:25,360
Two fucking more.

5965
05:42:27,260 --> 05:42:28,600
Here we go.

5966
05:42:29,860 --> 05:42:32,720
Alright, let's see if we fight Necros.

5967
05:42:33,360 --> 05:42:33,860
Yeah!

5968
05:42:36,260 --> 05:42:36,860
Yeah!

5969
05:42:36,880 --> 05:42:38,140
Get two more and then I'll be diamond.

5970
05:42:41,700 --> 05:42:42,300
Yeah!

5971
05:42:42,680 --> 05:42:43,740
Oh my god!

5972
05:42:44,260 --> 05:42:46,100
Okay, it's literally RNG.

5973
05:42:46,400 --> 05:42:48,880
I'm trying to RNG this right now.

5974
05:42:52,620 --> 05:42:53,220
Okay.

5975
05:42:57,460 --> 05:42:59,840
I like how her name's Emma Frost.

5976
05:43:01,640 --> 05:43:02,300
Oh my god.

5977
05:43:03,200 --> 05:43:05,660
I'm fucking trying to RNG this so badly.

5978
05:43:15,200 --> 05:43:15,920
Alright.

5979
05:43:19,220 --> 05:43:22,800
No, it's a... No, he's dueled with the Bruce Banner.

5980
05:43:27,220 --> 05:43:29,340
Skinny boy is back.

5981
05:43:33,200 --> 05:43:34,420
Oh my god.

5982
05:43:34,420 --> 05:43:36,680
Look, wouldn't it be funny if we lose?

5983
05:43:37,680 --> 05:43:40,060
And he did take away the ELO he gave me.

5984
05:43:40,660 --> 05:43:42,680
That would be so funny, guys.

5985
05:43:42,980 --> 05:43:45,020
That would be so fucking funny.

5986
05:43:48,780 --> 05:43:50,300
Don't say that!

5987
05:43:56,100 --> 05:43:57,980
Alright, don't jinx it.

5988
05:43:58,140 --> 05:43:58,240
Shh.

5989
05:43:58,740 --> 05:43:59,060
Shh.

5990
05:44:01,020 --> 05:44:02,200
I'm so tired.

5991
05:44:02,380 --> 05:44:03,680
I'm fucking delusional now.

5992
05:44:08,280 --> 05:44:08,980
Okay.

5993
05:44:08,980 --> 05:44:11,060
I've been playing ranked for so long.

5994
05:44:17,610 --> 05:44:20,250
Oh no, that Hanzo's scary though.

5995
05:44:20,910 --> 05:44:22,210
I remember that Hanzo.

5996
05:44:22,670 --> 05:44:24,550
He's actually really, really good.

5997
05:44:25,830 --> 05:44:31,270
I only lost with him because my team was mad.

5998
05:44:32,030 --> 05:44:33,910
My team was actually griefing.

5999
05:44:34,630 --> 05:44:37,190
There's a team where he was like, if you don't play...

6000
05:44:37,190 --> 05:44:40,730
If you don't play second tank, I'm gonna play... I'm gonna learn Spider-Man.

6001
05:44:41,130 --> 05:44:41,890
Oh no.

6002
05:44:44,630 --> 05:44:45,250
Oh no.

6003
05:44:45,990 --> 05:44:46,770
Little... No!

6004
05:44:52,020 --> 05:44:53,740
Oh no, I'm sorry.

6005
05:44:54,520 --> 05:44:55,760
I'm so sorry.

6006
05:44:58,800 --> 05:44:59,960
I'm so sorry.

6007
05:45:06,880 --> 05:45:07,560
Okay.

6008
05:45:18,260 --> 05:45:20,540
Guys, can we touch?

6009
05:45:20,780 --> 05:45:22,320
No, that's cool.

6010
05:45:22,560 --> 05:45:24,500
That's cool.

6011
05:45:28,940 --> 05:45:30,200
That's okay.

6012
05:45:31,460 --> 05:45:33,140
We don't need a touch.

6013
05:45:36,360 --> 05:45:37,200
Sorry.

6014
05:45:37,940 --> 05:45:39,140
Hot guy.

6015
05:45:40,120 --> 05:45:43,940
I just think of... Oh, he's not on Spider-Man.

6016
05:45:46,240 --> 05:45:47,320
Oh no.

6017
05:45:52,430 --> 05:45:53,110
It's okay.

6018
05:45:53,190 --> 05:45:53,650
It's fine.

6019
05:45:54,010 --> 05:45:55,330
He doesn't need to be on Spider-Man.

6020
05:45:58,870 --> 05:46:00,730
He doesn't need to be on... Guys.

6021
05:46:01,870 --> 05:46:06,190
Oh my god, again!

6022
05:46:07,470 --> 05:46:09,410
Oh, this is where I'm a little scared.

6023
05:46:12,790 --> 05:46:15,090
Wait, did he... Oh.

6024
05:46:16,510 --> 05:46:17,050
Okay.

6025
05:46:18,830 --> 05:46:20,710
Okay, I have ult, guys.

6026
05:46:21,150 --> 05:46:22,890
I can ult in there.

6027
05:46:27,930 --> 05:46:29,430
Oh shit, guys.

6028
05:46:29,610 --> 05:46:30,670
We're... Whoa, guys.

6029
05:46:30,730 --> 05:46:31,150
We're fine.

6030
05:46:31,650 --> 05:46:33,030
We're so healthy.

6031
05:46:34,070 --> 05:46:35,750
We're so healthy.

6032
05:46:37,510 --> 05:46:39,110
We're so healthy.

6033
05:46:40,430 --> 05:46:42,290
Oh, we are so healthy.

6034
05:46:45,610 --> 05:46:46,610
Hulk, no!

6035
05:46:48,130 --> 05:46:49,450
No, Hulk!

6036
05:46:52,580 --> 05:46:54,340
I cannot heal him!

6037
05:46:54,480 --> 05:46:55,080
I'm sorry!

6038
05:47:01,250 --> 05:47:03,070
Get back in the fight, Hulk!

6039
05:47:05,070 --> 05:47:06,070
Jesus Christ.

6040
05:47:15,940 --> 05:47:17,380
Okay, we're so healthy.

6041
05:47:17,540 --> 05:47:18,200
We're so healthy.

6042
05:47:18,400 --> 05:47:18,820
We're...

6043
05:47:21,640 --> 05:47:22,840
We're so healthy.

6044
05:47:23,240 --> 05:47:25,560
I'm gonna clap because of how healthy we are.

6045
05:47:25,760 --> 05:47:29,020
I'm gonna start clapping because I feel so fucking healthy right now.

6046
05:47:29,920 --> 05:47:34,720
We're gonna clap so hard because I feel so fucking healthy.

6047
05:47:34,720 --> 05:47:36,760
Oh no, Hulk.

6048
05:47:37,360 --> 05:47:38,900
Goodbye, little boy.

6049
05:47:39,060 --> 05:47:40,820
Goodbye, little boy.

6050
05:47:47,620 --> 05:47:49,500
I feel so healthy.

6051
05:47:51,960 --> 05:47:54,320
I have... I'm so close to ult.

6052
05:47:57,480 --> 05:47:58,880
I have to do this.

6053
05:47:59,540 --> 05:48:01,400
I have to do this.

6054
05:48:02,000 --> 05:48:02,840
What?

6055
05:48:06,150 --> 05:48:07,350
Oh no.

6056
05:48:07,970 --> 05:48:08,750
Oh no.

6057
05:48:09,460 --> 05:48:10,430
No, Giddo.

6058
05:48:10,610 --> 05:48:10,810
No!

6059
05:48:15,830 --> 05:48:16,320
Okay.

6060
05:48:32,590 --> 05:48:34,550
Oh no.

6061
05:48:35,930 --> 05:48:39,150
Guys, he gaveth and he taketh.

6062
05:48:40,710 --> 05:48:43,130
He gaveth and he taketh, you guys.

6063
05:48:55,370 --> 05:48:56,990
Guys, I don't know anymore.

6064
05:49:01,090 --> 05:49:01,690
Okay.

6065
05:49:02,050 --> 05:49:02,970
We'll be fine.

6066
05:49:03,030 --> 05:49:03,530
We'll be fine.

6067
05:49:03,850 --> 05:49:04,730
We'll be fine.

6068
05:49:05,670 --> 05:49:07,150
We will not be fine.

6069
05:49:07,270 --> 05:49:07,970
That is scary.

6070
05:49:08,650 --> 05:49:09,750
That is scary.

6071
05:49:14,630 --> 05:49:15,730
We'll be fine.

6072
05:49:16,470 --> 05:49:18,110
We'll be so fine.

6073
05:49:24,600 --> 05:49:25,500
Did you watch?

6074
05:49:28,280 --> 05:49:29,520
Guys, did you watch?

6075
05:49:30,040 --> 05:49:31,920
I think, like, something happened.

6076
05:49:37,140 --> 05:49:38,180
Okay, that's cool.

6077
05:49:39,100 --> 05:49:40,540
Okay, now we have damage.

6078
05:49:43,680 --> 05:49:44,880
Alright, now they ult.

6079
05:49:44,940 --> 05:49:45,220
Okay.

6080
05:49:47,460 --> 05:49:47,980
Alright.

6081
05:49:47,980 --> 05:49:48,500
Okay.

6082
05:49:49,600 --> 05:49:51,880
Ah, but... I don't... Oh, fuck.

6083
05:49:51,940 --> 05:49:52,480
I wasn't on heals.

6084
05:49:52,560 --> 05:49:52,880
I'm sorry.

6085
05:49:56,680 --> 05:49:57,200
Oops.

6086
05:49:58,240 --> 05:50:02,560
I don't know why I default DPS, but that was awkward.

6087
05:50:02,800 --> 05:50:03,660
That...

6088
05:50:04,620 --> 05:50:08,260
I think I'll do auto DPS.

6089
05:50:08,840 --> 05:50:09,360
What?

6090
05:50:09,880 --> 05:50:10,520
How?

6091
05:50:11,340 --> 05:50:13,280
How is it auto damage?

6092
05:50:14,440 --> 05:50:14,920
That would

6093
05:50:18,020 --> 05:50:18,680
be...

6094
05:50:18,680 --> 05:50:20,320
I don't know how that happened.

6095
05:50:22,920 --> 05:50:25,700
It actually auto damage.

6096
05:50:29,140 --> 05:50:32,200
I pressed Q and then it went to damage.

6097
05:50:35,400 --> 05:50:40,200
It, like, double tap damage when I pressed Q.

6098
05:50:41,560 --> 05:50:42,440
Whoops.

6099
05:50:43,320 --> 05:50:44,320
That was my bad.

6100
05:50:48,500 --> 05:50:49,980
It's Jeff time.

6101
05:50:51,920 --> 05:50:52,640
I didn't know.

6102
05:50:53,740 --> 05:50:55,360
I didn't know how.

6103
05:50:56,140 --> 05:50:57,460
How that happened.

6104
05:51:03,020 --> 05:51:03,740
Okay.

6105
05:51:04,040 --> 05:51:07,100
I did one bad thing that entire game.

6106
05:51:07,260 --> 05:51:10,000
Guys, just one bad thing.

6107
05:51:10,120 --> 05:51:12,620
It cannot be fully all my fault.

6108
05:51:13,120 --> 05:51:15,940
That's literally one bad game.

6109
05:51:16,220 --> 05:51:17,640
One fucking misclick.

6110
05:51:18,280 --> 05:51:21,720
I did so much in the rest of that game.

6111
05:51:21,860 --> 05:51:25,540
And then I did one bad move.

6112
05:51:33,540 --> 05:51:36,800
Yeah, I only killed my whole team once.

6113
05:51:37,300 --> 05:51:40,520
Guys, how can that be my fault?

6114
05:51:41,660 --> 05:51:43,820
We landed that far.

6115
05:51:44,640 --> 05:51:49,380
Also, I'm avoiding Wacky for fucking being a Luna main.

6116
05:51:54,460 --> 05:51:55,980
Just a little oopsie.

6117
05:51:57,640 --> 05:51:59,060
It's not my fault.

6118
05:51:59,300 --> 05:52:00,880
It's just one little oopsie.

6119
05:52:02,700 --> 05:52:04,320
I think we have three support players.

6120
05:52:05,340 --> 05:52:05,740
Legitimately.

6121
05:52:06,060 --> 05:52:08,940
Because the MF4 Frost wanted to play Luna too.

6122
05:52:29,560 --> 05:52:30,480
I hate this group.

6123
05:52:30,600 --> 05:52:31,240
I hate this group.

6124
05:52:32,880 --> 05:52:34,380
Oh no, I have to reload my hands.

6125
05:52:34,840 --> 05:52:35,980
I have to reload my mouth.

6126
05:52:42,270 --> 05:52:43,370
Oh my god, please.

6127
05:52:47,030 --> 05:52:47,430
Please.

6128
05:52:51,130 --> 05:52:51,530
Okay.

6129
05:52:51,530 --> 05:52:51,650
Okay.

6130
05:52:56,240 --> 05:52:57,960
Oh my god, please.

6131
05:52:58,500 --> 05:52:58,880
Live!

6132
05:53:03,410 --> 05:53:03,930
Live!

6133
05:53:09,810 --> 05:53:11,930
I can't keep healing forever!

6134
05:53:12,110 --> 05:53:13,630
You guys do so much damage!

6135
05:53:16,920 --> 05:53:17,460
Fuck this.

6136
05:53:18,340 --> 05:53:20,260
Oh my god, Ashley, fuck this.

6137
05:53:31,500 --> 05:53:32,460
Fuck this.

6138
05:53:35,700 --> 05:53:36,660
Fuck off.

6139
05:53:36,660 --> 05:53:37,120
Oh no.

6140
05:53:42,730 --> 05:53:44,030
Reloading mouth.

6141
05:53:47,050 --> 05:53:48,310
Throwing bubbles out.

6142
05:53:50,750 --> 05:53:52,250
Throwing more bubbles out.

6143
05:53:56,400 --> 05:53:57,320
Alright.

6144
05:54:00,340 --> 05:54:02,240
Throwing more bubbles out!

6145
05:54:07,280 --> 05:54:09,740
I feel like I hear something near me.

6146
05:54:10,880 --> 05:54:12,780
Wait, is that guy lagging?

6147
05:54:12,860 --> 05:54:14,460
Like what the fuck is going on with him?

6148
05:54:14,560 --> 05:54:15,320
You guys see that?

6149
05:54:18,740 --> 05:54:20,380
Guys, I'm a little worried here.

6150
05:54:20,520 --> 05:54:22,940
I'm a little...

6151
05:54:23,300 --> 05:54:23,660
Woah!

6152
05:54:25,140 --> 05:54:25,500
Woah!

6153
05:54:32,190 --> 05:54:35,390
Yeah, I had a feeling that we were not gonna live there.

6154
05:54:36,650 --> 05:54:38,490
Bum, bum, bum, bum.

6155
05:54:39,130 --> 05:54:42,210
I think this person does not know how to play Penny.

6156
05:54:46,550 --> 05:54:49,610
Bro, bro!

6157
05:54:50,070 --> 05:54:51,550
You gotta stop!

6158
05:54:52,090 --> 05:54:53,090
You gotta stop!

6159
05:54:56,680 --> 05:54:58,700
You gotta stop doing that!

6160
05:54:59,380 --> 05:55:00,620
Stop peeking!

6161
05:55:09,760 --> 05:55:12,640
Bro, I'm healing as best as I can.

6162
05:55:16,540 --> 05:55:21,280
No, I legitimately don't think this person plays Tank.

6163
05:55:22,220 --> 05:55:24,840
This person definitely doesn't play Tank at all.

6164
05:55:27,820 --> 05:55:29,340
That's basically it.

6165
05:55:32,640 --> 05:55:34,020
Like, he does his all.

6166
05:55:34,120 --> 05:55:35,460
He just gets fucking...

6167
05:55:36,540 --> 05:55:37,620
Like, is he okay?

6168
05:55:45,770 --> 05:55:46,410
Hello.

6169
05:56:00,470 --> 05:56:01,850
That's the thing, right?

6170
05:56:02,250 --> 05:56:03,070
No supports!

6171
05:56:03,670 --> 05:56:05,090
No supports for you!

6172
05:56:09,660 --> 05:56:11,220
That's fucking right.

6173
05:56:11,860 --> 05:56:12,600
RUN!

6174
05:56:14,000 --> 05:56:16,160
Fucking run, bitch!

6175
05:56:17,580 --> 05:56:19,740
Guys, I can play other things, guys.

6176
05:56:20,120 --> 05:56:20,420
See?

6177
05:56:22,380 --> 05:56:23,100
I... what?

6178
05:56:24,760 --> 05:56:25,340
How?

6179
05:56:25,480 --> 05:56:26,000
Oh, shit!

6180
05:56:30,850 --> 05:56:32,230
What the fuck?

6181
05:56:35,260 --> 05:56:37,980
Bro, I have to do a 1v1 against fucking Hawkeye!

6182
05:56:39,260 --> 05:56:41,580
Not in one trick!

6183
05:56:42,700 --> 05:56:46,440
Bro, I literally just did a 1v1 against a fucking Hawkeye!

6184
05:56:47,840 --> 05:56:49,200
That's impressive!

6185
05:56:51,480 --> 05:56:52,660
Who is she?

6186
05:56:58,220 --> 05:56:59,840
Alright, I heal myself.

6187
05:57:01,160 --> 05:57:02,540
Oh my god!

6188
05:57:06,500 --> 05:57:09,780
Jesus Christ, I gotta heal myself sometimes.

6189
05:57:25,750 --> 05:57:26,950
Let me out of here!

6190
05:57:27,350 --> 05:57:29,350
Let me fucking out of here!

6191
05:57:37,910 --> 05:57:38,950
Jesus Christ.

6192
05:57:39,590 --> 05:57:40,150
Bro!

6193
05:57:40,530 --> 05:57:43,650
What do you want me to do?!

6194
05:57:46,940 --> 05:57:49,220
Oh my god, 57% accuracy?

6195
05:57:49,260 --> 05:57:49,940
I'll take that.

6196
05:57:51,520 --> 05:57:54,120
As I told you, he giveth, then you taketh.

6197
05:58:02,920 --> 05:58:04,900
He giveth, then you taketh.

6198
05:58:14,190 --> 05:58:16,630
I still don't know what that fucking thing does.

6199
05:58:18,690 --> 05:58:19,850
Bro, I can't.

6200
05:58:19,870 --> 05:58:20,850
I can't, bro.

6201
05:58:21,030 --> 05:58:21,270
Bro.

6202
05:58:22,910 --> 05:58:24,950
I fucking can't deal with this.

6203
05:58:26,850 --> 05:58:28,230
I took one of them.

6204
05:58:28,690 --> 05:58:29,690
I took the Hella.

6205
05:58:30,710 --> 05:58:31,830
That's all that matters.

6206
05:58:32,010 --> 05:58:32,750
I took the Hella.

6207
05:58:36,160 --> 05:58:37,680
He went high ground?

6208
05:58:37,780 --> 05:58:39,100
Oh my god, I gave him high ground.

6209
05:58:46,720 --> 05:58:47,740
It's fine.

6210
05:58:48,000 --> 05:58:49,280
Two people died.

6211
05:58:50,220 --> 05:58:51,840
Two people died anyway.

6212
05:58:53,420 --> 05:58:56,640
I didn't think he would fucking fly up there!

6213
05:59:00,060 --> 05:59:00,620
Kidnap!

6214
05:59:00,720 --> 05:59:03,300
I kidnapped the one person that could fly!

6215
05:59:07,750 --> 05:59:08,230
Okay.

6216
05:59:09,530 --> 05:59:10,410
I don't know.

6217
05:59:10,630 --> 05:59:12,010
I think we just need two tanks.

6218
05:59:12,610 --> 05:59:13,490
That's really it.

6219
05:59:13,550 --> 05:59:14,990
They have two tanks and we don't.

6220
05:59:17,250 --> 05:59:18,950
I think that's our only problem.

6221
05:59:20,430 --> 05:59:22,970
They literally have two tanks.

6222
05:59:24,570 --> 05:59:29,210
Guys, I fucking did so much to keep these guys alive.

6223
05:59:30,210 --> 05:59:30,930
Oh

6224
05:59:34,220 --> 05:59:36,420
my god.

6225
05:59:36,920 --> 05:59:37,940
I went over.

6226
05:59:39,100 --> 05:59:39,500
I had

6227
05:59:44,420 --> 05:59:45,180
no...

6228
05:59:47,060 --> 05:59:50,820
Yeah, and our Penny guy is not a good tank.

6229
05:59:51,440 --> 05:59:53,100
She does not.

6230
05:59:53,220 --> 05:59:55,460
She does not play tank.

6231
05:59:56,660 --> 05:59:57,200
Yes.

6232
05:59:58,440 --> 05:59:59,840
Oh my

6233
06:00:04,180 --> 06:00:08,720
god.

6234
06:00:09,880 --> 06:00:12,460
Yeah, Penny was not the play.

6235
06:00:12,760 --> 06:00:16,460
Bro, I'm like stuck in this fucking... I'm stuck in this loop.

6236
06:00:16,680 --> 06:00:19,040
I'm never leaving this fucking loop, guys.

6237
06:00:19,380 --> 06:00:23,640
I'm never leaving this fucking loop!

6238
06:00:25,600 --> 06:00:27,340
Oh my god.

6239
06:00:28,800 --> 06:00:29,880
This purgatory.

6240
06:00:30,480 --> 06:00:32,020
This actual purgatory.

6241
06:00:32,100 --> 06:00:33,080
I'm avoiding you?

6242
06:00:33,080 --> 06:00:37,280
You can manage lister anytime in settings social.

6243
06:00:37,580 --> 06:00:39,020
Okay, we gotta manage this.

6244
06:00:39,220 --> 06:00:40,860
Okay, settings social.

6245
06:00:41,060 --> 06:00:45,080
We gotta manage this because I need to make sure all my voiceless is just...

6246
06:00:48,220 --> 06:00:48,780
Okay.

6247
06:00:49,700 --> 06:00:51,920
Okay, we need to... Okay, we're keeping that.

6248
06:00:53,660 --> 06:00:55,320
A maximum of three players.

6249
06:00:55,600 --> 06:00:55,980
Okay.

6250
06:00:57,220 --> 06:00:59,720
We're gonna make sure they're all just Luna players.

6251
06:00:59,720 --> 06:01:04,040
We gotta make them all Luna players then.

6252
06:01:06,380 --> 06:01:09,280
Oh my god, this is a problem.

6253
06:01:12,800 --> 06:01:14,040
Oh boy, her.

6254
06:01:14,780 --> 06:01:15,540
Oh shit.

6255
06:01:15,980 --> 06:01:16,480
No, please.

6256
06:01:16,540 --> 06:01:17,340
I don't want to be your friend.

6257
06:01:20,040 --> 06:01:21,340
Don't be my friend.

6258
06:01:24,820 --> 06:01:25,900
Don't accept it.

6259
06:01:30,840 --> 06:01:31,820
Oh my god.

6260
06:01:34,990 --> 06:01:36,650
I didn't mean it.

6261
06:01:36,770 --> 06:01:38,410
I didn't mean it.

6262
06:01:39,410 --> 06:01:41,330
I clicked too fast.

6263
06:01:43,130 --> 06:01:45,190
I clicked way too fast.

6264
06:01:46,850 --> 06:01:47,750
Oh god.

6265
06:01:48,390 --> 06:01:49,590
Oh my god, please.

6266
06:01:49,950 --> 06:01:50,210
Okay.

6267
06:01:50,750 --> 06:01:51,570
I'm... Okay.

6268
06:01:52,090 --> 06:01:53,010
It's still possible.

6269
06:01:53,150 --> 06:01:53,330
Sorry.

6270
06:01:53,810 --> 06:01:55,370
My mic was in front of my face.

6271
06:01:55,750 --> 06:01:57,010
It's still possible.

6272
06:01:58,250 --> 06:01:59,470
Oh my god, it's been six hours.

6273
06:01:59,590 --> 06:02:01,610
Okay, at the seven hour mark.

6274
06:02:01,770 --> 06:02:03,870
Oh my god, I'm supposed to do some recordings too today.

6275
06:02:03,870 --> 06:02:04,890
I'm sorry.

6276
06:02:05,050 --> 06:02:05,730
I'm so sorry.

6277
06:02:05,750 --> 06:02:07,230
I didn't think this would take this long.

6278
06:02:08,690 --> 06:02:11,070
I really did not think it would take this long, guys.

6279
06:02:17,010 --> 06:02:19,730
Emmanuel, thank you for the super chat.

6280
06:02:19,810 --> 06:02:20,490
Thank you, thank you.

6281
06:02:20,490 --> 06:02:20,690
Okay.

6282
06:02:21,110 --> 06:02:21,990
Okay, by the way.

6283
06:02:22,310 --> 06:02:23,210
Also, thank you for the super chat.

6284
06:02:23,270 --> 06:02:23,770
Thank you, thank you.

6285
06:02:23,850 --> 06:02:24,830
I'm gonna wish you a happy birthday soon.

6286
06:02:25,970 --> 06:02:26,330
But...

6287
06:02:26,750 --> 06:02:27,670
Before I say anything...

6288
06:02:27,670 --> 06:02:29,030
Okay, but like...

6289
06:02:29,030 --> 06:02:29,870
I gotta say...

6290
06:02:30,970 --> 06:02:33,110
Even if I didn't fuck up that one ult...

6291
06:02:33,870 --> 06:02:35,930
Even if I didn't fuck up that one ult there...

6292
06:02:35,930 --> 06:02:37,850
Where like, you know, everybody died...

6293
06:02:37,850 --> 06:02:40,610
Because I accidentally... I don't know how I did it...

6294
06:02:40,610 --> 06:02:41,950
But I accidentally double pressed Q...

6295
06:02:42,750 --> 06:02:44,090
I would... We would not have won.

6296
06:02:44,990 --> 06:02:46,470
We would not have fucking won.

6297
06:02:46,590 --> 06:02:47,450
There was no way.

6298
06:02:52,610 --> 06:02:54,270
Our team was...

6299
06:02:54,270 --> 06:02:57,150
We had one tank that didn't know how to play tank.

6300
06:03:05,700 --> 06:03:07,740
Emmanuel, happy birthday to you.

6301
06:03:08,420 --> 06:03:09,940
Happy birthday to you.

6302
06:03:10,120 --> 06:03:11,280
Happy birthday to you.

6303
06:03:11,380 --> 06:03:12,680
Happy birthday to you, Emmanuel.

6304
06:03:12,980 --> 06:03:14,020
Happy birthday to you.

6305
06:03:14,360 --> 06:03:15,400
Happy birthday!

6306
06:03:24,880 --> 06:03:26,140
Oh my God.

6307
06:03:26,840 --> 06:03:27,720
Here we go.

6308
06:03:29,040 --> 06:03:31,000
Oh my God, we were so close.

6309
06:03:31,660 --> 06:03:33,560
We were so close.

6310
06:03:35,480 --> 06:03:36,080
Okay.

6311
06:03:40,280 --> 06:03:41,680
God, I hate this map.

6312
06:03:41,740 --> 06:03:43,480
Why do we always play this map?

6313
06:03:43,840 --> 06:03:44,760
We have two tanks.

6314
06:03:45,060 --> 06:03:46,960
Okay, I'm gonna give it to Groot.

6315
06:03:49,960 --> 06:03:50,700
That's fucked.

6316
06:03:52,340 --> 06:03:53,400
That's fucked, bro.

6317
06:03:54,600 --> 06:03:55,980
Oh my God, and he's dancing.

6318
06:03:56,620 --> 06:03:58,440
He walled us off and he's dancing.

6319
06:04:02,000 --> 06:04:03,060
That's so fucked.

6320
06:04:03,840 --> 06:04:06,380
He walls us off and then he starts dancing.

6321
06:04:08,820 --> 06:04:09,820
That's messed up, bro.

6322
06:04:18,000 --> 06:04:19,240
I don't know if I should...

6323
06:04:20,400 --> 06:04:22,600
Oh, maybe I should have given it to the Iron Fist.

6324
06:04:22,840 --> 06:04:23,100
Yeah.

6325
06:04:24,940 --> 06:04:27,520
The thing is, I don't know how good our Iron Fist is.

6326
06:04:27,720 --> 06:04:34,380
So like, you know, when you don't know how good your DPS is, I don't like putting it on a DPS.

6327
06:04:34,620 --> 06:04:36,320
Just because I don't know if I can trust him.

6328
06:04:49,220 --> 06:04:50,320
Oh no.

6329
06:04:51,620 --> 06:04:55,320
No, no, that's...

6330
06:04:57,650 --> 06:04:58,250
That's fucking right.

6331
06:04:58,350 --> 06:04:59,650
And I go back to healing.

6332
06:05:00,970 --> 06:05:03,310
As if nothing bad happened.

6333
06:05:03,630 --> 06:05:04,970
That's fucking right.

6334
06:05:05,270 --> 06:05:09,190
I go back to healing as if I was not in that fight anymore.

6335
06:05:12,330 --> 06:05:13,810
That's why I play back there.

6336
06:05:17,030 --> 06:05:18,030
I don't know.

6337
06:05:18,030 --> 06:05:21,430
I think I'll give it to our Doctor Strange, maybe.

6338
06:05:21,950 --> 06:05:22,890
This is why I play over here.

6339
06:05:23,030 --> 06:05:23,910
Because I have the health pack.

6340
06:05:24,310 --> 06:05:26,030
I also forget that...

6341
06:05:36,100 --> 06:05:36,960
You know what?

6342
06:05:37,160 --> 06:05:37,620
Fuck it.

6343
06:05:38,620 --> 06:05:39,320
I knew it.

6344
06:05:39,780 --> 06:05:41,440
I caught me in a good call here.

6345
06:05:42,780 --> 06:05:43,400
That's right!

6346
06:05:43,420 --> 06:05:44,620
It's time to fight!

6347
06:05:44,660 --> 06:05:45,740
Okay, it's time to heal a little bit.

6348
06:05:45,800 --> 06:05:47,080
But then we fight again!

6349
06:05:47,160 --> 06:05:47,820
And then we heal.

6350
06:05:47,940 --> 06:05:49,080
And then I back away.

6351
06:05:54,420 --> 06:05:55,140
Jesus Christ.

6352
06:05:56,460 --> 06:05:58,520
Because we got a mixture.

6353
06:06:03,280 --> 06:06:04,860
Okay, I...

6354
06:06:04,860 --> 06:06:05,320
Whoa!

6355
06:06:05,900 --> 06:06:06,640
Okay!

6356
06:06:07,680 --> 06:06:09,340
I'm fearing a little bit.

6357
06:06:09,500 --> 06:06:10,040
Just...

6358
06:06:10,040 --> 06:06:11,560
Oh, they're blocking.

6359
06:06:12,000 --> 06:06:13,400
Oh my god.

6360
06:06:13,840 --> 06:06:15,620
This is where we leave now.

6361
06:06:16,720 --> 06:06:18,600
This is exactly where we leave.

6362
06:06:20,380 --> 06:06:21,940
Alright, that guy is crazy.

6363
06:06:22,680 --> 06:06:24,340
What happened to the whale?

6364
06:06:24,540 --> 06:06:25,820
What happened to the whale?

6365
06:06:27,720 --> 06:06:29,300
That's a good question.

6366
06:06:34,560 --> 06:06:35,080
Okay.

6367
06:06:41,660 --> 06:06:42,180
Alright.

6368
06:06:44,520 --> 06:06:46,720
That is a very good question.

6369
06:06:50,220 --> 06:06:51,220
Oh my god.

6370
06:06:52,480 --> 06:06:54,180
Oh, don't you think you're gonna do that again to me?

6371
06:06:54,620 --> 06:06:54,880
Really?

6372
06:06:55,820 --> 06:06:56,560
Oh shit!

6373
06:06:56,680 --> 06:06:57,640
Of course he fucking ults!

6374
06:06:57,780 --> 06:06:59,060
That's the only way you can kill me!

6375
06:06:59,380 --> 06:06:59,860
That's...

6376
06:07:01,900 --> 06:07:02,760
That's right!

6377
06:07:02,800 --> 06:07:03,620
I'm salty!

6378
06:07:04,220 --> 06:07:06,280
Of fucking course I'm fucking salty!

6379
06:07:06,860 --> 06:07:11,220
Literally, I shit on that kid and then he ults because he can't kill me any other way.

6380
06:07:11,500 --> 06:07:12,920
He can't kill me!

6381
06:07:15,940 --> 06:07:18,520
He doesn't know how to kill me any other way but that.

6382
06:07:19,720 --> 06:07:21,180
Of course I'm fucking salty.

6383
06:07:26,370 --> 06:07:26,890
Okay.

6384
06:07:29,390 --> 06:07:30,450
Almost out of ult though.

6385
06:07:34,310 --> 06:07:35,650
Is that a Hawkeye?

6386
06:07:35,910 --> 06:07:36,210
No.

6387
06:07:40,830 --> 06:07:41,570
Oh, okay.

6388
06:07:42,230 --> 06:07:42,870
That's fine.

6389
06:07:44,050 --> 06:07:45,750
Oh my god!

6390
06:07:50,160 --> 06:07:50,920
Oh, that's fine.

6391
06:07:53,080 --> 06:07:54,040
That's fine.

6392
06:07:57,200 --> 06:07:58,720
Alright, that's okay.

6393
06:07:59,980 --> 06:08:02,060
Okay, I'm not making that mistake again.

6394
06:08:08,740 --> 06:08:12,260
Guys, I don't know if you noticed but I'm not making that mistake.

6395
06:08:12,480 --> 06:08:13,380
Oh shit.

6396
06:08:18,200 --> 06:08:19,280
Oh yeah, no.

6397
06:08:19,460 --> 06:08:20,740
They're fucking dead.

6398
06:08:21,620 --> 06:08:22,180
They're...

6399
06:08:23,800 --> 06:08:24,360
They're...

6400
06:08:24,360 --> 06:08:24,920
I'm dead.

6401
06:08:29,240 --> 06:08:30,660
Oh my god.

6402
06:08:30,900 --> 06:08:32,880
Why do people run away from my ult?

6403
06:08:37,500 --> 06:08:39,980
You do not need to run away from my ult, guys.

6404
06:08:45,610 --> 06:08:46,610
Maybe a Hella?

6405
06:08:49,670 --> 06:08:51,710
Our DPS is dying way too much.

6406
06:08:52,510 --> 06:08:53,910
I don't feel comfortable about that.

6407
06:08:56,210 --> 06:08:57,530
I'm gonna give it to our Hella.

6408
06:08:58,170 --> 06:08:59,590
Just see if that helps.

6409
06:09:04,060 --> 06:09:05,160
Oh my god, please.

6410
06:09:06,320 --> 06:09:07,680
I'm asking that question too.

6411
06:09:12,440 --> 06:09:13,420
Oh my god, please.

6412
06:09:13,520 --> 06:09:14,640
I'm so close to an ult.

6413
06:09:16,960 --> 06:09:17,360
Please.

6414
06:09:17,680 --> 06:09:17,940
Yes!

6415
06:09:19,660 --> 06:09:20,060
Nice.

6416
06:09:20,680 --> 06:09:21,340
Get over here.

6417
06:09:21,420 --> 06:09:21,760
Get over here.

6418
06:09:21,820 --> 06:09:22,260
Get over here.

6419
06:09:22,880 --> 06:09:23,500
Get over here.

6420
06:09:23,780 --> 06:09:24,920
I got it just in time.

6421
06:09:25,540 --> 06:09:26,260
Get over here.

6422
06:09:28,040 --> 06:09:29,160
And then I leave.

6423
06:09:31,420 --> 06:09:33,120
Oh, that's such an insane ult!

6424
06:09:33,140 --> 06:09:33,700
That's insane!

6425
06:09:34,780 --> 06:09:36,240
But we used two support ults.

6426
06:09:38,880 --> 06:09:40,560
We used two support ults for that.

6427
06:09:41,700 --> 06:09:43,480
This is an OP spot right here.

6428
06:09:43,820 --> 06:09:44,200
Hold this.

6429
06:09:45,320 --> 06:09:46,880
Oh my god, he's grooting.

6430
06:09:47,680 --> 06:09:49,180
There's a Spider-Man ult too.

6431
06:09:49,900 --> 06:09:51,300
Hold me, hold me, hold me.

6432
06:09:51,840 --> 06:09:52,540
This is bad.

6433
06:09:54,680 --> 06:09:55,820
This is very bad.

6434
06:09:57,660 --> 06:09:59,220
Sorry, I couldn't do anything.

6435
06:10:03,120 --> 06:10:03,660
Sorry.

6436
06:10:05,900 --> 06:10:06,980
Did he stand down?

6437
06:10:07,800 --> 06:10:08,960
Oh, he died.

6438
06:10:13,560 --> 06:10:15,740
I thought, you know, he stood down.

6439
06:10:16,200 --> 06:10:17,320
But he's dead.

6440
06:10:22,190 --> 06:10:23,250
Oh no!

6441
06:10:24,590 --> 06:10:25,670
Oh shit!

6442
06:10:30,370 --> 06:10:31,490
Jesus Christ.

6443
06:10:31,670 --> 06:10:33,390
I don't know what else I can do.

6444
06:10:37,970 --> 06:10:41,650
To be fair, it's only OP because...

6445
06:10:41,650 --> 06:10:42,430
To be fair, if...

6446
06:10:43,110 --> 06:10:46,630
If he didn't have a Spider-Man ult, we would've been fine.

6447
06:10:46,750 --> 06:10:47,230
But he did.

6448
06:10:47,450 --> 06:10:48,990
I didn't see her!

6449
06:10:50,830 --> 06:10:51,610
Oh my god.

6450
06:10:51,630 --> 06:10:51,910
It's okay.

6451
06:10:51,990 --> 06:10:52,630
Our team's okay.

6452
06:10:53,290 --> 06:10:54,230
I didn't see her.

6453
06:10:57,770 --> 06:10:58,610
Oh nice.

6454
06:10:58,850 --> 06:10:59,550
Hella got it.

6455
06:11:04,660 --> 06:11:07,880
It was only because Spider-Man had ult that it fucked us over.

6456
06:11:09,200 --> 06:11:11,520
The only way we could win that was that...

6457
06:11:12,460 --> 06:11:12,940
If...

6458
06:11:13,520 --> 06:11:15,600
If I had ult or like...

6459
06:11:15,600 --> 06:11:16,340
Oh no, Hella.

6460
06:11:17,080 --> 06:11:18,620
I legitimately can't...

6461
06:11:18,620 --> 06:11:20,440
Oh, this is scary.

6462
06:11:20,620 --> 06:11:22,420
Because I could get headshot at any time.

6463
06:11:24,480 --> 06:11:25,920
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah.

6464
06:11:25,920 --> 06:11:27,560
I need to reposition myself.

6465
06:11:27,940 --> 06:11:28,760
I hate this map.

6466
06:11:28,840 --> 06:11:29,760
I hate this map.

6467
06:11:30,720 --> 06:11:33,260
Like, I don't know how to reposition myself here.

6468
06:11:36,640 --> 06:11:37,120
No!

6469
06:11:50,030 --> 06:11:50,590
No!

6470
06:11:52,170 --> 06:11:53,610
He followed me!

6471
06:11:57,890 --> 06:11:59,370
I don't have crowd control.

6472
06:11:59,550 --> 06:12:00,070
Which one?

6473
06:12:05,010 --> 06:12:05,850
She actually...

6474
06:12:06,130 --> 06:12:06,890
Wait, can...

6475
06:12:06,890 --> 06:12:07,910
Does she have walls?

6476
06:12:08,230 --> 06:12:09,010
With the Hella?

6477
06:12:09,550 --> 06:12:10,670
When she's ulting?

6478
06:12:13,770 --> 06:12:15,590
No, she has a million HP.

6479
06:12:15,810 --> 06:12:17,410
There's no point in sniping her in the air.

6480
06:12:17,410 --> 06:12:19,510
Unless the entire team hits her.

6481
06:12:21,750 --> 06:12:23,070
No, I used the freeze.

6482
06:12:23,290 --> 06:12:24,170
I just didn't have...

6483
06:12:24,170 --> 06:12:24,470
I just...

6484
06:12:25,730 --> 06:12:27,510
Didn't have a chance to use it there.

6485
06:12:28,210 --> 06:12:29,610
I mean, I can't freeze her in the air.

6486
06:12:29,770 --> 06:12:31,550
When she's in the air...

6487
06:12:31,550 --> 06:12:32,310
Uh...

6488
06:12:32,310 --> 06:12:33,550
I can't freeze her.

6489
06:12:38,520 --> 06:12:39,740
Oh, I used the X-Ray.

6490
06:12:39,920 --> 06:12:40,740
I didn't know that.

6491
06:12:42,720 --> 06:12:43,400
Oh my god.

6492
06:12:43,480 --> 06:12:45,000
Do I just have to lock-in lock-in?

6493
06:12:46,060 --> 06:12:48,000
If I lock-in lock-in, I don't talk.

6494
06:12:51,100 --> 06:12:51,520
XD

6495
06:12:55,780 --> 06:12:56,200
Okay.

6496
06:12:58,280 --> 06:13:02,060
Alright, if we lose this one, I might lock-in lock-in so we can end the stream earlier.

6497
06:13:02,880 --> 06:13:03,300
XD

6498
06:13:06,840 --> 06:13:08,620
I might lock-in lock-in.

6499
06:13:08,740 --> 06:13:09,130
Cause like...

6500
06:13:09,920 --> 06:13:11,900
When I stream, I get distracted more.

6501
06:13:15,720 --> 06:13:16,140
Okay.

6502
06:13:16,800 --> 06:13:18,760
If we lose this one, I'll lock-in.

6503
06:13:19,700 --> 06:13:21,600
I'll lock-in so fucking hard.

6504
06:13:22,540 --> 06:13:25,240
XD Okay.

6505
06:13:28,500 --> 06:13:28,840
Alright.

6506
06:13:37,370 --> 06:13:38,050
Okay.

6507
06:13:42,980 --> 06:13:43,760
No you're not.

6508
06:13:44,860 --> 06:13:45,780
You can lie.

6509
06:13:46,100 --> 06:13:46,840
Oh my god.

6510
06:13:47,400 --> 06:13:47,720
I'm in.

6511
06:13:48,400 --> 06:13:50,160
Okay, we gotta get the...

6512
06:13:50,160 --> 06:13:52,000
The double heals to our tank.

6513
06:13:55,460 --> 06:13:56,600
Alright, it's fine.

6514
06:13:56,600 --> 06:13:58,020
He's gruting.

6515
06:14:02,580 --> 06:14:03,080
Okay.

6516
06:14:05,920 --> 06:14:06,230
Nice.

6517
06:14:07,100 --> 06:14:08,400
Oh my god, thank you.

6518
06:14:13,140 --> 06:14:13,760
Nice.

6519
06:14:14,260 --> 06:14:14,580
Alright.

6520
06:14:16,840 --> 06:14:18,000
We're doing it.

6521
06:14:19,260 --> 06:14:20,040
He's gruting it.

6522
06:14:22,020 --> 06:14:24,040
I'm gonna get my fucking ult charge off you.

6523
06:14:25,960 --> 06:14:26,580
Nice.

6524
06:14:27,380 --> 06:14:28,580
Okay, but not gonna lie.

6525
06:14:29,000 --> 06:14:31,140
Playing Apex has made me less headshot-y.

6526
06:14:31,640 --> 06:14:32,800
Cause like...

6527
06:14:32,800 --> 06:14:35,440
Less focus on headshots and more focus on body shots.

6528
06:14:35,840 --> 06:14:36,700
Because like...

6529
06:14:36,700 --> 06:14:37,920
In Apex...

6530
06:14:37,920 --> 06:14:40,640
It's just more efficient to do head- body shots.

6531
06:14:40,820 --> 06:14:42,520
When you're playing tra- When you're a tracker.

6532
06:14:46,260 --> 06:14:49,700
Cause I play- I use tracking gun- I'm so good at tracking guns.

6533
06:14:50,020 --> 06:14:52,020
So I prioritize body shots more.

6534
06:14:52,460 --> 06:14:53,240
So like...

6535
06:14:53,240 --> 06:14:54,580
I'm like- I need to like...

6536
06:14:54,580 --> 06:14:56,040
Train myself to headshot again.

6537
06:14:56,080 --> 06:14:58,120
Cause I- Oh my god!

6538
06:14:58,720 --> 06:15:00,900
I don't- What?!

6539
06:15:01,630 --> 06:15:03,960
I didn't even see the Spider-Man!

6540
06:15:10,500 --> 06:15:12,200
Oh my god, here I go.

6541
06:15:17,440 --> 06:15:18,920
It's just...

6542
06:15:18,920 --> 06:15:20,720
Makes sense to do...

6543
06:15:20,720 --> 06:15:21,580
Body shots.

6544
06:15:22,260 --> 06:15:23,280
Like center mass.

6545
06:15:23,520 --> 06:15:23,740
Yeah.

6546
06:15:28,150 --> 06:15:28,890
Nice.

6547
06:15:30,880 --> 06:15:31,850
Oh, he's gruting.

6548
06:15:33,590 --> 06:15:34,630
He's gruting.

6549
06:15:44,830 --> 06:15:45,730
That's right!

6550
06:15:46,070 --> 06:15:47,950
I'm on heals this time!

6551
06:15:49,730 --> 06:15:50,730
I'm on heals!

6552
06:15:51,150 --> 06:15:53,250
I remembered to be on heals!

6553
06:15:53,930 --> 06:15:55,130
That's looking right!

6554
06:15:55,610 --> 06:15:56,370
That's right!

6555
06:15:59,190 --> 06:15:59,910
Oh no.

6556
06:16:01,750 --> 06:16:02,450
Oh, he fucked up.

6557
06:16:02,550 --> 06:16:03,170
He fucked it up.

6558
06:16:03,270 --> 06:16:04,150
He fucked it up!

6559
06:16:08,910 --> 06:16:10,470
Oh my god, he fucked it up.

6560
06:16:12,790 --> 06:16:15,330
Okay, but R also fucked it up too.

6561
06:16:15,810 --> 06:16:19,330
So like, it- There you go.

6562
06:16:19,350 --> 06:16:20,050
That's a freeze.

6563
06:16:23,090 --> 06:16:24,850
That's a freeze right there.

6564
06:16:31,010 --> 06:16:31,490
Okay.

6565
06:16:32,750 --> 06:16:34,050
Super tryhard mode.

6566
06:16:38,540 --> 06:16:39,280
That's right.

6567
06:16:41,460 --> 06:16:44,520
This is what I was like when I used to grind video games a lot.

6568
06:16:44,640 --> 06:16:46,000
But like, I used to be better.

6569
06:16:46,000 --> 06:16:47,000
Now, I'm just...

6570
06:16:48,020 --> 06:16:49,840
Trying- Trying my best.

6571
06:16:54,300 --> 06:16:56,260
I froze somebody.

6572
06:16:58,260 --> 06:16:59,180
Oh no.

6573
06:17:02,180 --> 06:17:04,420
Oh, that was a waste of the clap though.

6574
06:17:05,080 --> 06:17:06,240
I think I wasted the clap there.

6575
06:17:12,660 --> 06:17:13,680
Keep punching!

6576
06:17:15,040 --> 06:17:16,120
Keep punching!

6577
06:17:16,500 --> 06:17:17,780
You know you want to!

6578
06:17:20,340 --> 06:17:21,680
Just play Tekken!

6579
06:17:22,980 --> 06:17:26,300
It's fucking Tekken.

6580
06:17:31,060 --> 06:17:32,780
Okay, I almost have a-

6581
06:17:37,400 --> 06:17:38,840
I hit a headshot- Woah!

6582
06:17:39,600 --> 06:17:40,160
No!

6583
06:17:41,100 --> 06:17:42,600
How did he know?

6584
06:17:43,660 --> 06:17:45,120
Okay, I need to look at this.

6585
06:17:48,260 --> 06:17:48,980
What?

6586
06:17:49,500 --> 06:17:52,080
What the fuck happened while I was dead?

6587
06:17:57,360 --> 06:17:59,660
What the fuck happened there?

6588
06:18:00,980 --> 06:18:02,080
It's time to dance!

6589
06:18:03,180 --> 06:18:04,560
Oh shit, I should've used my ult.

6590
06:18:04,980 --> 06:18:05,460
Oh.

6591
06:18:05,680 --> 06:18:09,620
I accidentally- I accidentally- I fat fingered my ult.

6592
06:18:16,900 --> 06:18:18,460
They don't have to know.

6593
06:18:18,820 --> 06:18:21,040
They don't have to- Oh, it doesn't matter!

6594
06:18:21,340 --> 06:18:22,040
Oh, it resets!

6595
06:18:22,200 --> 06:18:22,540
Thank god!

6596
06:18:22,580 --> 06:18:23,620
I thought it'd carry over.

6597
06:18:23,980 --> 06:18:24,900
Guys, it didn't matter.

6598
06:18:24,900 --> 06:18:26,220
It doesn't carry over!

6599
06:18:26,440 --> 06:18:28,800
I- It doesn't carry over!

6600
06:18:29,360 --> 06:18:30,400
Oh my god!

6601
06:18:30,900 --> 06:18:32,120
Oh my god!

6602
06:18:33,020 --> 06:18:33,260
Oh,

6603
06:18:37,880 --> 06:18:38,500
thank god!

6604
06:18:38,980 --> 06:18:40,340
Oh, I didn't post it!

6605
06:18:40,640 --> 06:18:40,980
Thank god!

6606
06:18:41,120 --> 06:18:42,780
I was like- Oh shit!

6607
06:18:42,920 --> 06:18:45,980
And then I realized- It doesn't carry over.

6608
06:18:46,200 --> 06:18:47,220
Thank fucking god.

6609
06:18:47,820 --> 06:18:48,860
I thought I fucked up.

6610
06:18:52,140 --> 06:18:53,900
I got scared for a bit.

6611
06:18:53,900 --> 06:18:55,760
I was thinking about cough.

6612
06:18:58,740 --> 06:18:59,540
Holy shit.

6613
06:19:02,800 --> 06:19:03,920
Mistakes didn't happen.

6614
06:19:06,800 --> 06:19:08,680
Where do we go when they port?

6615
06:19:08,880 --> 06:19:09,720
That's the thing.

6616
06:19:10,820 --> 06:19:14,120
Cause like, if they port here, they can go down and flank us here.

6617
06:19:14,240 --> 06:19:15,980
So at best, I feel like I go here.

6618
06:19:16,320 --> 06:19:18,520
But we go here, they get the point for free.

6619
06:19:20,360 --> 06:19:21,600
Yeah, I need to remember the C move.

6620
06:19:32,380 --> 06:19:32,900
Okay.

6621
06:19:33,960 --> 06:19:34,480
Okay.

6622
06:19:58,210 --> 06:20:01,370
Oh my god, I'm trying my best to keep you all alive.

6623
06:20:01,650 --> 06:20:03,090
But this is very difficult.

6624
06:20:04,090 --> 06:20:06,330
You know, this is incredibly difficult.

6625
06:20:12,550 --> 06:20:15,810
I'm sorry, but like, what do we do?

6626
06:20:16,930 --> 06:20:19,770
They just start punching!

6627
06:20:24,430 --> 06:20:26,230
Oh god, he's healing himself.

6628
06:20:26,330 --> 06:20:26,550
Good.

6629
06:20:26,910 --> 06:20:27,750
Heal yourself.

6630
06:20:30,110 --> 06:20:31,790
We're coming back!

6631
06:20:35,610 --> 06:20:37,150
Just live!

6632
06:20:38,790 --> 06:20:39,150
Nice.

6633
06:20:42,810 --> 06:20:43,210
Live!

6634
06:20:44,790 --> 06:20:45,310
Okay.

6635
06:20:45,970 --> 06:20:46,450
Alright.

6636
06:20:47,550 --> 06:20:47,790
Alright.

6637
06:20:48,710 --> 06:20:49,770
Oh my god.

6638
06:20:50,130 --> 06:20:51,130
Oh my god.

6639
06:20:54,590 --> 06:20:55,750
We did it.

6640
06:21:00,050 --> 06:21:01,710
Oh my god, we did it.

6641
06:21:02,050 --> 06:21:02,970
Oh my god.

6642
06:21:04,230 --> 06:21:04,890
Oh my god.

6643
06:21:07,830 --> 06:21:08,850
TP first.

6644
06:21:12,190 --> 06:21:13,310
Devin diff?

6645
06:21:14,070 --> 06:21:16,090
Unfortunately, who the fuck is Devin?

6646
06:21:16,810 --> 06:21:17,010
Oh.

6647
06:21:20,390 --> 06:21:22,290
Lock in, lock in, lock in, lock in.

6648
06:21:24,190 --> 06:21:25,390
Gotta lock in.

6649
06:21:25,690 --> 06:21:27,490
Lock in, lock in, lock in.

6650
06:21:29,010 --> 06:21:30,750
Please, I just wanna be...

6651
06:21:30,750 --> 06:21:32,790
I just wanna be Diamond.

6652
06:21:36,570 --> 06:21:37,250
Meow.

6653
06:21:39,230 --> 06:21:39,910
Meow.

6654
06:21:44,730 --> 06:21:47,190
Literally TP onto their tank.

6655
06:21:47,350 --> 06:21:48,150
Bro, what?

6656
06:21:48,530 --> 06:21:50,090
We have Wolverine?

6657
06:21:55,590 --> 06:21:56,270
Okay.

6658
06:21:58,270 --> 06:21:58,910
Oh.

6659
06:21:59,970 --> 06:22:02,050
I wish I was a good Mantis player.

6660
06:22:02,190 --> 06:22:03,770
I think if I was a good Mantis player...

6661
06:22:03,770 --> 06:22:05,150
I can climb even easier.

6662
06:22:05,730 --> 06:22:06,810
Because Mantis...

6663
06:22:06,810 --> 06:22:08,030
Like, less people are...

6664
06:22:08,030 --> 06:22:10,670
Less people main Mantis than Luna.

6665
06:22:15,470 --> 06:22:16,570
Porto time.

6666
06:22:17,310 --> 06:22:17,850
Goodbye.

6667
06:22:26,180 --> 06:22:26,860
God, please!

6668
06:22:26,980 --> 06:22:27,580
Can you take...

6669
06:22:27,580 --> 06:22:28,180
Make it...

6670
06:22:28,180 --> 06:22:28,880
Oh shit.

6671
06:22:31,160 --> 06:22:32,340
I think you messed up.

6672
06:22:38,100 --> 06:22:39,200
I'm just gonna say...

6673
06:22:39,200 --> 06:22:41,260
I think he, like, messed up the...

6674
06:22:41,920 --> 06:22:42,640
The grabbing.

6675
06:22:42,780 --> 06:22:44,720
Remember when he was like, I'm gonna grab them?

6676
06:22:44,940 --> 06:22:46,940
I don't think he grabbed them, guys.

6677
06:22:58,330 --> 06:23:00,050
I don't know if he's grabbing them or not.

6678
06:23:01,170 --> 06:23:02,130
Oh, he's so low.

6679
06:23:03,870 --> 06:23:04,230
Yeah!

6680
06:23:04,490 --> 06:23:05,370
We did it!

6681
06:23:09,500 --> 06:23:10,260
Oh, yeah.

6682
06:23:10,280 --> 06:23:11,260
He took so long.

6683
06:23:11,360 --> 06:23:12,960
He was, like, deciding where to go.

6684
06:23:13,040 --> 06:23:14,100
And I'm like, are you okay, bro?

6685
06:23:14,340 --> 06:23:15,320
Like, are you okay?

6686
06:23:16,000 --> 06:23:16,720
Danko, welcome...

6687
06:23:16,720 --> 06:23:18,060
Dank, welcome to Tomato Farm.

6688
06:23:18,060 --> 06:23:18,960
Welcome, welcome.

6689
06:23:24,790 --> 06:23:26,020
Two more.

6690
06:23:26,500 --> 06:23:28,000
Back to two more games.

6691
06:23:28,600 --> 06:23:30,040
Two more games.

6692
06:23:32,000 --> 06:23:34,640
Two more games and we'll make it.

6693
06:23:38,320 --> 06:23:39,320
Oh my god.

6694
06:23:39,860 --> 06:23:43,540
Bro looked at Google Maps to find out where to go.

6695
06:23:44,460 --> 06:23:45,300
Oh my god.

6696
06:23:46,140 --> 06:23:47,760
Two more games.

6697
06:23:50,340 --> 06:23:50,780
Ah!

6698
06:23:54,100 --> 06:23:56,460
Forever two more.

6699
06:23:57,280 --> 06:23:58,700
Come on!

6700
06:24:00,840 --> 06:24:03,640
He's timing it for the best timeline.

6701
06:24:05,600 --> 06:24:06,680
Oh, no.

6702
06:24:06,760 --> 06:24:07,640
I got Devon.

6703
06:24:09,260 --> 06:24:10,060
Oh, no.

6704
06:24:10,900 --> 06:24:12,660
Didn't they told me to avoid Devon?

6705
06:24:12,940 --> 06:24:14,060
Oh, no.

6706
06:24:16,700 --> 06:24:19,340
Were they saying avoid Devon?

6707
06:24:19,340 --> 06:24:21,740
Bro, what's wrong with you, Devon?

6708
06:24:22,180 --> 06:24:23,660
What's wrong with you?

6709
06:24:36,010 --> 06:24:38,070
Wait, what's wrong with Devon and metal?

6710
06:24:42,880 --> 06:24:44,960
Not as good as Devon.

6711
06:24:46,960 --> 06:24:49,060
Devon, you better fucking lock it in, Devon.

6712
06:24:49,460 --> 06:24:52,080
I've been playing this for way too long.

6713
06:24:52,520 --> 06:24:54,560
Devon, you better fucking lock it in.

6714
06:24:54,800 --> 06:24:56,000
Dev, where are you, Devon?

6715
06:24:56,600 --> 06:24:59,100
I need you to lock the fuck in.

6716
06:25:00,540 --> 06:25:02,680
Oh, they have the Dirt Tank.

6717
06:25:02,820 --> 06:25:04,080
Dirt Tank was really good.

6718
06:25:10,280 --> 06:25:11,620
They're like, avoid Devon.

6719
06:25:11,800 --> 06:25:12,520
I'm like, why?

6720
06:25:12,620 --> 06:25:13,520
And then I get Devon.

6721
06:25:16,280 --> 06:25:17,240
Instructions unclear.

6722
06:25:17,760 --> 06:25:19,400
I got Devon on my team.

6723
06:25:22,120 --> 06:25:22,880
Devon, please.

6724
06:25:22,980 --> 06:25:25,020
You better fucking lock it in, Devon.

6725
06:25:25,860 --> 06:25:28,920
Please, I need to be top 500, Devon.

6726
06:25:31,200 --> 06:25:34,380
I don't know who I should give it to for this one.

6727
06:25:36,340 --> 06:25:37,880
I do have a...

6728
06:25:38,780 --> 06:25:41,200
I do have a Hella, though.

6729
06:25:41,380 --> 06:25:42,700
So, maybe the Hella?

6730
06:25:45,240 --> 06:25:45,780
Goodbye.

6731
06:25:45,780 --> 06:25:45,940
Goodbye.

6732
06:25:53,480 --> 06:25:58,120
I think I've learned to just insta-freeze when I see a portal.

6733
06:25:58,540 --> 06:25:59,260
Oh my god, guys!

6734
06:25:59,360 --> 06:26:00,940
Come back into the portal, guys!

6735
06:26:01,600 --> 06:26:02,360
Guys, no!

6736
06:26:02,720 --> 06:26:03,060
No!

6737
06:26:06,480 --> 06:26:08,180
Come back, Devon!

6738
06:26:08,880 --> 06:26:09,460
No!

6739
06:26:10,800 --> 06:26:12,320
He got locked in.

6740
06:26:16,020 --> 06:26:17,720
Holy shit, that's scary.

6741
06:26:17,940 --> 06:26:19,720
Get back in here, soldier!

6742
06:26:20,840 --> 06:26:22,340
He jumped in.

6743
06:26:22,780 --> 06:26:23,780
Holy shit.

6744
06:26:24,160 --> 06:26:25,400
That's crazy.

6745
06:26:27,340 --> 06:26:29,280
That's fucking crazy.

6746
06:26:44,260 --> 06:26:46,020
That's the Storm player, too.

6747
06:26:46,180 --> 06:26:47,680
Apparently, he's really good at Storm.

6748
06:26:47,860 --> 06:26:48,900
So, like, I'm a little nervous.

6749
06:26:49,880 --> 06:26:50,960
Oh shit, that pillar was so close.

6750
06:26:50,960 --> 06:26:52,260
This is fucking scary.

6751
06:26:54,340 --> 06:26:55,380
You don't understand.

6752
06:26:59,200 --> 06:27:01,140
Sorry, you're gonna have to deal with that yourself.

6753
06:27:01,880 --> 06:27:03,180
I fucking left.

6754
06:27:04,380 --> 06:27:07,040
I was like, I am not dealing with that guy.

6755
06:27:07,180 --> 06:27:08,200
I'm sorry.

6756
06:27:08,900 --> 06:27:09,920
Good luck.

6757
06:27:17,100 --> 06:27:17,420
Okay.

6758
06:27:22,320 --> 06:27:22,780
Okay.

6759
06:27:24,900 --> 06:27:25,760
You got this.

6760
06:27:25,940 --> 06:27:26,320
Live!

6761
06:27:27,080 --> 06:27:29,240
I'm gonna save my ult as a defensive.

6762
06:27:30,040 --> 06:27:32,320
I don't trust it, like...

6763
06:27:38,040 --> 06:27:39,000
I don't know.

6764
06:27:45,890 --> 06:27:46,950
You guys are fine, right?

6765
06:27:50,610 --> 06:27:51,010
Okay.

6766
06:27:54,330 --> 06:27:55,110
What?

6767
06:27:55,530 --> 06:27:56,810
Oh shit!

6768
06:27:57,390 --> 06:27:58,350
Oh shit!

6769
06:27:58,770 --> 06:28:00,570
He's forming a spirit ball!

6770
06:28:01,090 --> 06:28:01,730
He's...

6771
06:28:01,730 --> 06:28:02,430
Fuck!

6772
06:28:05,770 --> 06:28:07,470
What the fuck?

6773
06:28:07,890 --> 06:28:09,670
What the fuck was that?

6774
06:28:10,950 --> 06:28:11,770
Oh, no.

6775
06:28:14,830 --> 06:28:15,910
No!

6776
06:28:18,870 --> 06:28:19,950
Guys!

6777
06:28:20,490 --> 06:28:21,170
Guys!

6778
06:28:21,930 --> 06:28:22,550
Please!

6779
06:28:23,250 --> 06:28:24,590
He's in our spot!

6780
06:28:26,650 --> 06:28:27,950
Guys, please!

6781
06:28:28,630 --> 06:28:30,030
He's in our spot!

6782
06:28:30,670 --> 06:28:31,070
Guys!

6783
06:28:33,490 --> 06:28:34,090
Guys!

6784
06:28:34,490 --> 06:28:35,770
No way!

6785
06:28:37,150 --> 06:28:38,350
No way!

6786
06:28:39,550 --> 06:28:40,690
Like, I had...

6787
06:28:40,690 --> 06:28:42,490
And then the worst part is like...

6788
06:28:42,490 --> 06:28:46,070
I was like the character they had to solo ult.

6789
06:28:47,910 --> 06:28:51,090
Like, legitimately, solo ulting me was the...

6790
06:28:52,270 --> 06:28:53,290
What's the word?

6791
06:28:53,410 --> 06:28:54,070
Was the...

6792
06:28:55,330 --> 06:28:56,490
Guys, we're fucking dead here.

6793
06:28:56,990 --> 06:28:58,650
Guys, we are so dead.

6794
06:29:03,170 --> 06:29:08,190
It was the right move because I had the ult that was going to win the game for everybody.

6795
06:29:09,710 --> 06:29:11,330
Oh my god.

6796
06:29:13,210 --> 06:29:13,970
Oh, goodbye!

6797
06:29:14,250 --> 06:29:15,030
You're so...

6798
06:29:15,030 --> 06:29:17,950
I saw a man die today.

6799
06:29:25,410 --> 06:29:28,070
Bro, I keep getting fucking...

6800
06:29:28,590 --> 06:29:29,030
bored.

6801
06:29:29,390 --> 06:29:30,030
Vortexed.

6802
06:29:39,110 --> 06:29:40,210
Just break it.

6803
06:29:40,410 --> 06:29:41,510
Just fucking break it.

6804
06:29:41,730 --> 06:29:42,250
Who cares?

6805
06:29:46,900 --> 06:29:47,400
I don't know.

6806
06:29:47,440 --> 06:29:48,680
What the fuck do you want me to do?

6807
06:29:58,060 --> 06:29:58,660
Okay.

6808
06:29:59,140 --> 06:30:00,260
He's over there.

6809
06:30:00,620 --> 06:30:01,820
I'm scared though.

6810
06:30:02,180 --> 06:30:04,360
Oh, I just looked at him.

6811
06:30:04,680 --> 06:30:05,700
I'm sorry.

6812
06:30:05,780 --> 06:30:07,360
I just looked at you.

6813
06:30:11,570 --> 06:30:12,470
I missed.

6814
06:30:13,530 --> 06:30:15,870
Are you serious?!

6815
06:30:21,660 --> 06:30:24,460
Hey, there's like a guy right here.

6816
06:30:28,370 --> 06:30:29,330
Like...

6817
06:30:34,500 --> 06:30:36,280
Jesus Christ.

6818
06:30:37,660 --> 06:30:38,620
No.

6819
06:30:38,920 --> 06:30:39,640
No way.

6820
06:30:39,980 --> 06:30:42,040
No fucking way!

6821
06:30:42,540 --> 06:30:45,780
Oh my god, he ate them all!

6822
06:30:46,700 --> 06:30:48,400
He ate them all!

6823
06:30:49,020 --> 06:30:51,280
No fucking way!

6824
06:30:52,160 --> 06:30:54,600
He ate them all!

6825
06:30:57,600 --> 06:30:59,720
I couldn't do anything!

6826
06:31:00,360 --> 06:31:02,280
I just had to watch it happen!

6827
06:31:04,660 --> 06:31:06,140
My entire team!

6828
06:31:06,480 --> 06:31:06,860
God!

6829
06:31:10,680 --> 06:31:12,240
That was scary.

6830
06:31:19,200 --> 06:31:19,400
Okay.

6831
06:31:22,360 --> 06:31:23,660
This Jeff is good.

6832
06:31:24,440 --> 06:31:26,220
This Jeff knows how to use his ult.

6833
06:31:27,840 --> 06:31:28,880
Which is annoying.

6834
06:31:29,060 --> 06:31:29,520
I hate him.

6835
06:31:32,340 --> 06:31:33,000
I hate him.

6836
06:31:33,300 --> 06:31:33,980
So much.

6837
06:31:38,800 --> 06:31:38,940
Okay.

6838
06:31:39,780 --> 06:31:40,320
Please.

6839
06:31:43,420 --> 06:31:45,040
Please, someone stop them.

6840
06:31:48,510 --> 06:31:49,070
What?

6841
06:31:49,230 --> 06:31:49,870
Did he fuck up?

6842
06:31:50,130 --> 06:31:51,690
What the fuck happened?

6843
06:31:52,830 --> 06:31:54,030
Did he mess it up?

6844
06:31:59,280 --> 06:32:00,600
What the fu- What?

6845
06:32:02,540 --> 06:32:03,980
What happened there?

6846
06:32:09,360 --> 06:32:10,940
Did you see that?

6847
06:32:12,800 --> 06:32:14,160
What the fuck happened?

6848
06:32:22,010 --> 06:32:23,410
Oh my god!

6849
06:32:24,130 --> 06:32:27,030
When he said I was going to unleash it, I didn't think he was going to do it now!

6850
06:32:34,600 --> 06:32:35,540
Hey, you're alive.

6851
06:32:40,580 --> 06:32:42,660
This is scary.

6852
06:32:43,380 --> 06:32:45,520
Oh my god, it's just one of them.

6853
06:32:45,940 --> 06:32:47,240
That's five.

6854
06:32:47,880 --> 06:32:48,920
That's okay.

6855
06:32:54,780 --> 06:32:56,820
Oh my god.

6856
06:32:57,180 --> 06:32:59,040
Oh my god, thank god.

6857
06:33:04,350 --> 06:33:05,570
I stunned him.

6858
06:33:06,470 --> 06:33:07,150
That's right.

6859
06:33:07,370 --> 06:33:08,170
I am what?

6860
06:33:09,690 --> 06:33:11,170
That's fucking right.

6861
06:33:13,130 --> 06:33:14,570
Oh wait, that's not good.

6862
06:33:14,650 --> 06:33:15,310
We lost one.

6863
06:33:15,890 --> 06:33:17,370
Guys, we lost one.

6864
06:33:20,550 --> 06:33:22,250
Guys, they can still fight, guys.

6865
06:33:24,450 --> 06:33:25,010
Guys!

6866
06:33:25,630 --> 06:33:27,830
Guys, it's not over yet, guys!

6867
06:33:27,930 --> 06:33:29,410
They can still contest!

6868
06:33:30,450 --> 06:33:32,390
Oh, this is bad.

6869
06:33:36,370 --> 06:33:37,430
Guys, please.

6870
06:33:42,920 --> 06:33:44,620
Oh my god.

6871
06:33:45,260 --> 06:33:46,480
This is bad.

6872
06:33:47,160 --> 06:33:48,260
This is actually bad.

6873
06:33:55,390 --> 06:33:56,110
Nice.

6874
06:34:04,000 --> 06:34:04,960
Oh god.

6875
06:34:05,480 --> 06:34:07,720
Oh my god, I'm dancing, please!

6876
06:34:08,420 --> 06:34:10,320
All I do is dance!

6877
06:34:11,700 --> 06:34:14,440
That's all I know how to do!

6878
06:34:19,560 --> 06:34:21,720
That's everything I know!

6879
06:34:25,800 --> 06:34:27,620
Oh my god, I'm fucking... I'm gonna go...

6880
06:34:27,620 --> 06:34:28,960
I'm gonna break.

6881
06:34:29,040 --> 06:34:30,440
I'm gonna fucking break, guys.

6882
06:34:40,900 --> 06:34:42,820
I'm fucking... I'm gonna have a breakdown.

6883
06:34:43,060 --> 06:34:43,800
I'm gonna...

6884
06:34:43,800 --> 06:34:45,340
Devon, please give me...

6885
06:34:45,340 --> 06:34:47,340
Guys, okay, the worst part is that...

6886
06:34:48,000 --> 06:34:50,220
MVP gives you 40 plus points.

6887
06:34:51,140 --> 06:34:52,480
That's the worst part.

6888
06:34:53,480 --> 06:34:59,020
If I could get MVP, I could get 40 plus points and I don't even need to play one more game.

6889
06:35:00,000 --> 06:35:01,120
That's the thing.

6890
06:35:01,260 --> 06:35:06,260
I wouldn't need to play one more game if I had 40 plus points.

6891
06:35:06,260 --> 06:35:06,900
It...

6892
06:35:10,860 --> 06:35:11,820
It sucks!

6893
06:35:12,040 --> 06:35:12,640
Cause support...

6894
06:35:12,640 --> 06:35:14,660
It's so hard for the support to get MVP.

6895
06:35:19,020 --> 06:35:20,240
I don't know how...

6896
06:35:20,240 --> 06:35:20,980
How to get it.

6897
06:35:24,220 --> 06:35:26,160
It's like DPS and tank.

6898
06:35:28,020 --> 06:35:28,540
They can.

6899
06:35:29,400 --> 06:35:31,300
Right now, it's our...

6900
06:35:31,980 --> 06:35:33,640
It's our Mantis.

6901
06:35:33,740 --> 06:35:35,760
But the thing is, the Mantis is DPSing.

6902
06:35:36,260 --> 06:35:37,120
So it's like...

6903
06:35:37,120 --> 06:35:38,100
It's so difficult.

6904
06:35:38,300 --> 06:35:38,840
Cause like...

6905
06:35:38,840 --> 06:35:40,260
It relies on...

6906
06:35:40,780 --> 06:35:42,140
DPS versus heals.

6907
06:35:42,640 --> 06:35:43,060
So like...

6908
06:35:43,060 --> 06:35:45,080
Being DPS is faster to rank up.

6909
06:35:45,480 --> 06:35:46,420
Which is like...

6910
06:35:46,420 --> 06:35:46,980
The downside.

6911
06:35:49,160 --> 06:35:50,260
DPS is actually...

6912
06:35:51,100 --> 06:35:51,620
Uh...

6913
06:35:52,320 --> 06:35:52,840
Faster...

6914
06:35:52,840 --> 06:35:53,840
To rank up and stuff.

6915
06:35:54,980 --> 06:35:55,880
That's how like...

6916
06:35:55,880 --> 06:35:57,900
Surefour was so ahead of me all the time.

6917
06:36:03,570 --> 06:36:04,530
Because like...

6918
06:36:04,530 --> 06:36:05,090
He just...

6919
06:36:05,090 --> 06:36:08,170
He keeps getting MVP and because he gets MVP, he ranks up faster.

6920
06:36:10,670 --> 06:36:12,190
I almost went back in.

6921
06:36:12,390 --> 06:36:13,470
That would've been so bad.

6922
06:36:16,250 --> 06:36:17,930
Oh my god!

6923
06:36:19,250 --> 06:36:19,930
Guys!

6924
06:36:20,210 --> 06:36:21,830
This is very bad!

6925
06:36:26,470 --> 06:36:29,090
Guys, I need you to get out of here!

6926
06:36:29,410 --> 06:36:31,990
I do not feel comfortable being here.

6927
06:36:33,430 --> 06:36:34,110
Guys!

6928
06:36:34,570 --> 06:36:35,230
Please!

6929
06:36:36,610 --> 06:36:37,630
This is it.

6930
06:36:38,330 --> 06:36:39,610
We fight this.

6931
06:36:40,350 --> 06:36:41,910
We fucking fight this.

6932
06:36:45,290 --> 06:36:48,510
We fucking...

6933
06:36:48,510 --> 06:36:49,150
Oh yeah.

6934
06:36:51,930 --> 06:36:52,210
Oh!

6935
06:36:54,430 --> 06:36:55,850
I guess I die.

6936
06:36:56,270 --> 06:36:56,910
I...

6937
06:36:59,950 --> 06:37:03,050
Why did we fight that for so long?

6938
06:37:06,410 --> 06:37:07,950
High ground was not it.

6939
06:37:08,310 --> 06:37:10,170
High ground was definitely not it.

6940
06:37:12,490 --> 06:37:15,410
I did not feel good about the high ground fight there.

6941
06:37:21,100 --> 06:37:21,620
Okay.

6942
06:37:24,000 --> 06:37:26,200
I feel like if we split, it's better.

6943
06:37:31,590 --> 06:37:32,710
Are we gonna do this again?

6944
06:37:34,670 --> 06:37:35,190
Okay.

6945
06:37:39,920 --> 06:37:41,440
I'm just gonna heal here.

6946
06:37:43,040 --> 06:37:44,000
It's just easier.

6947
06:37:49,400 --> 06:37:49,920
Please.

6948
06:37:51,500 --> 06:37:51,960
No.

6949
06:37:53,760 --> 06:37:54,740
Oh my god.

6950
06:37:54,860 --> 06:37:55,140
Okay.

6951
06:37:57,080 --> 06:37:57,760
Oh no!

6952
06:37:58,060 --> 06:37:58,940
Oh no!

6953
06:37:59,260 --> 06:37:59,800
Oh!

6954
06:37:59,980 --> 06:38:00,380
Please!

6955
06:38:01,300 --> 06:38:02,840
Cause I don't have anything!

6956
06:38:07,160 --> 06:38:08,120
I'm trying!

6957
06:38:08,720 --> 06:38:11,220
You're taking so much damage!

6958
06:38:15,570 --> 06:38:16,450
Alright.

6959
06:38:16,710 --> 06:38:17,690
We die I guess.

6960
06:38:18,130 --> 06:38:18,470
Goodbye.

6961
06:38:19,490 --> 06:38:20,370
Goodbye.

6962
06:38:25,860 --> 06:38:26,940
Oh my god.

6963
06:38:27,600 --> 06:38:28,120
Please!

6964
06:38:30,000 --> 06:38:32,180
We have Storm ult.

6965
06:38:32,260 --> 06:38:33,820
I have to save my ult for Storm.

6966
06:38:37,740 --> 06:38:39,400
We're so bad at pushing.

6967
06:38:42,100 --> 06:38:43,620
We don't have any picks.

6968
06:38:44,040 --> 06:38:46,240
To be fair, our Punisher is not doing so well.

6969
06:38:49,680 --> 06:38:52,380
I don't think our Punisher is doing very well either too.

6970
06:38:56,990 --> 06:38:57,970
I can't.

6971
06:38:58,450 --> 06:38:59,570
I don't have an angle.

6972
06:39:01,210 --> 06:39:02,490
I don't have an angle.

6973
06:39:10,930 --> 06:39:12,410
Oh my god, we actually got a kill.

6974
06:39:15,410 --> 06:39:16,490
Oh my god!

6975
06:39:16,590 --> 06:39:16,950
What?

6976
06:39:17,730 --> 06:39:18,710
Oh my god.

6977
06:39:19,230 --> 06:39:19,770
Aww.

6978
06:39:20,450 --> 06:39:21,230
This sucks.

6979
06:39:21,310 --> 06:39:22,510
This was last fight too.

6980
06:39:23,130 --> 06:39:23,910
Okay, nice.

6981
06:39:24,330 --> 06:39:27,030
They have Storm ult so I hope they do something.

6982
06:39:27,430 --> 06:39:27,870
Alright!

6983
06:39:28,150 --> 06:39:29,370
Goodbye everybody!

6984
06:39:30,890 --> 06:39:32,430
If you live, congratulations.

6985
06:39:33,870 --> 06:39:35,510
If you live.

6986
06:39:37,190 --> 06:39:37,510
No!

6987
06:39:42,520 --> 06:39:43,800
They were right!

6988
06:39:44,740 --> 06:39:48,540
They were right when they told me to avoid Devon!

6989
06:39:51,540 --> 06:39:54,380
They were right!

6990
06:39:57,560 --> 06:40:00,220
They were like, Devon's bad luck.

6991
06:40:00,620 --> 06:40:01,420
He was right.

6992
06:40:02,060 --> 06:40:02,780
He was.

6993
06:40:05,740 --> 06:40:07,060
Can't believe it.

6994
06:40:08,840 --> 06:40:09,140
Alright.

6995
06:40:11,300 --> 06:40:12,400
Who do I avoid?

6996
06:40:13,060 --> 06:40:13,880
Oh my god, I'm in like...

6997
06:40:13,880 --> 06:40:15,360
I'm actually in hell right now.

6998
06:40:15,600 --> 06:40:16,880
I'm in fucking hell.

6999
06:40:18,980 --> 06:40:19,880
Oh my god.

7000
06:40:19,960 --> 06:40:21,320
Wait, who do I avoid?

7001
06:40:21,400 --> 06:40:22,120
I don't know.

7002
06:40:24,340 --> 06:40:25,540
I don't know.

7003
06:40:32,740 --> 06:40:33,380
Let's see.

7004
06:40:33,440 --> 06:40:34,480
Do we actually avoid Devon?

7005
06:40:34,620 --> 06:40:35,460
I'm gonna avoid Devon.

7006
06:40:36,100 --> 06:40:37,820
They were like, avoid Devon.

7007
06:40:37,980 --> 06:40:39,160
And I was like, do I really?

7008
06:40:39,500 --> 06:40:40,140
Okay, I avoid.

7009
06:40:41,240 --> 06:40:41,580
Alright.

7010
06:40:41,580 --> 06:40:42,360
Okay.

7011
06:40:42,420 --> 06:40:43,260
Alright, guys.

7012
06:40:43,400 --> 06:40:44,780
I'm gonna lock in now.

7013
06:40:44,980 --> 06:40:46,340
Okay, I'm gonna put it on text.

7014
06:40:47,920 --> 06:40:49,880
Jokey is locking in.

7015
06:40:56,080 --> 06:40:57,180
I'm locking in.

7016
06:40:57,660 --> 06:40:58,860
I'm not gonna talk.

7017
06:41:39,770 --> 06:41:43,410
I was gonna lock in now, but like, why is this taking so long to get a match?

7018
06:41:43,490 --> 06:41:44,730
Like, who's internet is this?

7019
06:41:44,850 --> 06:41:47,350
Like, I was so ready to lock in.

7020
06:41:47,350 --> 06:41:51,610
Like, I was so fucking ready to lock in.

7021
06:41:51,750 --> 06:41:53,830
But why is my game not in yet?

7022
06:41:54,830 --> 06:41:58,070
Like, I was like, okay, this is taking way too long.

7023
06:42:03,480 --> 06:42:05,600
How am I supposed to lock in?

7024
06:42:05,760 --> 06:42:06,180
How?

7025
06:42:08,740 --> 06:42:09,840
I'm locking in.

7026
06:42:10,840 --> 06:42:11,360
Finally.

7027
06:42:13,600 --> 06:42:14,500
Okay, nice.

7028
06:42:14,920 --> 06:42:15,980
Alright, now I'm locking in.

7029
06:42:48,600 --> 06:42:49,960
What I needed to do was sing, really.

7030
06:43:20,040 --> 06:43:22,820
Three, two, one.

7031
06:43:23,800 --> 06:43:26,160
All you need to do is capture the mission area.

7032
06:43:26,580 --> 06:43:26,900
Got it?

7033
06:43:28,160 --> 06:43:33,180
What Loki has begun in Asgard, I will complete.

7034
06:43:53,400 --> 06:43:56,880
Looks like the mission area is yours to capture now.

7035
06:44:02,040 --> 06:44:02,980
I'm hurt.

7036
06:44:03,580 --> 06:44:04,080
The

7037
06:44:16,300 --> 06:44:18,760
mission area is yours.

7038
06:44:40,870 --> 06:44:42,410
I'm making a comeback.

7039
06:44:42,410 --> 06:44:45,770
Let them come and face the queen of hell.

7040
06:44:46,990 --> 06:44:47,870
Control locked.

7041
06:44:48,630 --> 06:44:49,650
Be your best self.

7042
06:44:55,340 --> 06:44:57,680
An opportunity for combat.

7043
06:45:03,880 --> 06:45:05,360
Needed that, thanks.

7044
06:45:06,880 --> 06:45:07,300
Glow

7045
06:45:36,900 --> 06:45:37,520
up.

7046
06:45:39,140 --> 06:45:40,820
I'm making a comeback.

7047
06:45:45,970 --> 06:45:46,730
Unleash!

7048
06:45:47,070 --> 06:45:49,970
Their team's capture progress has passed the halfway point.

7049
06:45:50,950 --> 06:45:51,290
Glow up.

7050
06:46:11,380 --> 06:46:13,460
I am ready to put on a show.

7051
06:46:19,630 --> 06:46:21,690
Your powers are mine.

7052
06:46:34,760 --> 06:46:37,300
I'm back in the fight.

7053
06:46:53,000 --> 06:46:54,900
I think it's a tank, dude.

7054
06:46:55,380 --> 06:46:57,560
I think it's a tank, dude.

7055
06:46:57,740 --> 06:46:58,800
It's like fucking...

7056
06:46:59,210 --> 06:47:00,140
It's a tank.

7057
06:47:00,860 --> 06:47:02,480
It's a fucking tank.

7058
06:47:04,240 --> 06:47:06,240
My team didn't lock in.

7059
06:47:06,360 --> 06:47:09,080
What do I do when team doesn't lock in?

7060
06:47:11,080 --> 06:47:12,280
Oh my god.

7061
06:47:12,420 --> 06:47:13,640
What do I do?

7062
06:47:15,520 --> 06:47:17,060
My team isn't locked.

7063
06:47:19,300 --> 06:47:21,480
I don't even know who's doing anything.

7064
06:47:21,880 --> 06:47:22,960
I guess our Namor?

7065
06:47:23,680 --> 06:47:24,460
Our Namor.

7066
06:47:25,020 --> 06:47:27,340
So I guess I'll give this to my Namor.

7067
06:47:27,580 --> 06:47:28,900
I'll give this to him.

7068
06:47:30,680 --> 06:47:32,720
Alright, locking back in.

7069
06:47:35,700 --> 06:47:37,440
Locking back in.

7070
06:47:38,560 --> 06:47:40,360
This will be fun.

7071
06:47:41,720 --> 06:47:43,460
This will be fun.

7072
06:48:05,280 --> 06:48:05,940
It's a scratch.

7073
06:48:14,420 --> 06:48:15,100
Mission

7074
06:48:18,970 --> 06:48:20,970
area is yours to capture now.

7075
06:48:26,820 --> 06:48:28,260
Capture the mission area.

7076
06:48:33,020 --> 06:48:35,260
You are fortunate Namor was here.

7077
06:48:40,180 --> 06:48:42,040
Gosh, you saved my little spot.

7078
06:48:50,480 --> 06:48:52,720
No swimming away now, little fish.

7079
06:48:53,880 --> 06:48:55,500
Keep an eye on this spot.

7080
06:51:46,710 --> 06:51:47,310
Capture

7081
06:51:52,230 --> 06:51:53,490
the mission area.

7082
06:51:53,790 --> 06:51:54,530
Keep going.

7083
06:52:14,980 --> 06:52:17,220
You'll have to keep fighting until you have a winner.

7084
06:52:17,340 --> 06:52:20,800
I think it was impossible with this team.

7085
06:52:21,180 --> 06:52:23,800
Guys, we're back to three games.

7086
06:52:23,840 --> 06:52:24,960
I'm stuck in this loop.

7087
06:52:25,380 --> 06:52:28,720
I'm actually stuck in this loop.

7088
06:52:29,080 --> 06:52:32,100
I'm fucking stuck in this crazy ass.

7089
06:52:33,960 --> 06:52:38,820
In this crazy ass loop.

7090
06:52:42,100 --> 06:52:43,600
Oh my god.

7091
06:52:44,160 --> 06:52:44,980
Oh my god.

7092
06:52:46,000 --> 06:52:47,340
When will I break the loop?

7093
06:52:48,020 --> 06:52:50,380
When will I break the fucking loop?

7094
06:52:50,880 --> 06:52:53,320
It's been three games for 20 years.

7095
06:52:54,200 --> 06:52:56,620
I'm never gonna break the loop.

7096
06:52:58,140 --> 06:52:59,740
Oh my god.

7097
06:52:59,980 --> 06:53:02,140
I'm never gonna break the loop.

7098
06:53:13,950 --> 06:53:14,510
I'm never gonna break the loop.

7099
06:53:14,510 --> 06:53:15,290
Oh my god.

7100
06:53:15,510 --> 06:53:16,470
This is crazy.

7101
06:53:16,730 --> 06:53:18,390
This is actually crazy.

7102
06:53:18,930 --> 06:53:20,710
I thought I was stuck flat one.

7103
06:53:26,630 --> 06:53:28,510
Games are so rough.

7104
06:53:38,860 --> 06:53:39,420
Alright.

7105
06:53:43,390 --> 06:53:45,330
Okay, next time I'm not gonna mute myself.

7106
06:53:45,510 --> 06:53:46,170
I'll just...

7107
06:53:48,170 --> 06:53:49,630
I'll express myself.

7108
06:53:50,770 --> 06:53:52,590
I'm gonna express myself.

7109
06:54:04,070 --> 06:54:05,570
Oh my god.

7110
06:54:05,630 --> 06:54:07,090
Now the queues are taking forever.

7111
06:54:07,250 --> 06:54:08,750
I played for so long.

7112
06:54:08,910 --> 06:54:12,450
I played for so long that it's not instant anymore.

7113
06:54:13,150 --> 06:54:14,370
Oh my god.

7114
06:54:14,710 --> 06:54:16,230
I'm actually in hell.

7115
06:54:16,590 --> 06:54:17,510
I'm in hell.

7116
06:54:17,650 --> 06:54:20,510
I played for so long that my queues aren't instant.

7117
06:54:23,010 --> 06:54:25,450
I have to keep going.

7118
06:54:34,260 --> 06:54:35,060
Oh my god.

7119
06:54:35,120 --> 06:54:39,820
I think the worst part is that I play and the other people are still playing as well.

7120
06:54:40,100 --> 06:54:41,520
And then...

7121
06:54:42,900 --> 06:54:45,940
So the cutoff keeps getting higher and higher.

7122
06:54:55,180 --> 06:54:56,680
Oh my god.

7123
06:55:10,290 --> 06:55:11,490
How high?

7124
06:55:11,610 --> 06:55:12,470
It's Diamond 3.

7125
06:55:13,010 --> 06:55:15,390
The cutoff is currently Diamond 3.

7126
06:55:16,330 --> 06:55:17,870
I'm going fucking insane.

7127
06:55:17,870 --> 06:55:20,090
I'm actually...

7128
06:55:20,090 --> 06:55:21,350
I need water though.

7129
06:55:21,670 --> 06:55:22,870
I need...

7130
06:55:25,810 --> 06:55:27,390
Oh my god.

7131
06:55:27,490 --> 06:55:28,310
We actually...

7132
06:55:28,310 --> 06:55:31,590
We actually have been stuck in this yellow hell of Plat 1.

7133
06:55:52,640 --> 06:55:53,320
Alright.

7134
06:55:53,600 --> 06:55:54,140
Come on.

7135
06:55:58,020 --> 06:55:59,840
Oh my god.

7136
06:56:08,920 --> 06:56:10,120
Oh my god.

7137
06:56:10,220 --> 06:56:11,660
Why is this taking so long?

7138
06:56:12,480 --> 06:56:13,460
Holy shit.

7139
06:56:13,840 --> 06:56:15,800
I'm gonna fucking go crazy.

7140
06:56:17,560 --> 06:56:24,820
I think the worst part is that I feel like I'm being held hostage by just the loading screen alone.

7141
06:56:25,120 --> 06:56:28,720
I wanna know who it is so I can, like, queue dodge this.

7142
06:56:29,220 --> 06:56:29,520
I...

7143
06:56:33,600 --> 06:56:35,340
I just want you...

7144
06:56:35,340 --> 06:56:37,520
I just want a fucking top 500.

7145
06:56:40,040 --> 06:56:42,140
I just want top 500.

7146
06:56:42,140 --> 06:56:43,940
Please, I'm so close.

7147
06:56:44,900 --> 06:56:46,520
I was supposed to record stuff today.

7148
06:56:46,820 --> 06:56:48,480
I was told today's the deadline.

7149
06:56:51,300 --> 06:56:52,320
I'm sorry.

7150
06:56:54,860 --> 06:56:57,000
I'll record it right after this.

7151
06:56:57,640 --> 06:56:59,620
I'll record it right after.

7152
06:57:02,640 --> 06:57:05,300
That's why I said...

7153
06:57:06,080 --> 06:57:07,400
I didn't think...

7154
06:57:07,400 --> 06:57:09,780
I didn't think it would be...

7155
06:57:09,780 --> 06:57:11,040
take this long.

7156
06:57:12,140 --> 06:57:15,080
I legitimately didn't think it would take this long.

7157
06:57:22,560 --> 06:57:25,240
By the way... No, because I've been recording every day.

7158
06:57:25,440 --> 06:57:27,020
I've been recording every day.

7159
06:57:27,480 --> 06:57:29,200
And then, like...

7160
06:57:29,200 --> 06:57:30,800
But it's a lot of...

7161
06:57:30,800 --> 06:57:31,120
What?

7162
06:57:32,520 --> 06:57:33,400
Oh my god.

7163
06:57:34,540 --> 06:57:36,460
I've been recording every day.

7164
06:57:36,860 --> 06:57:38,280
And it's a lot of recordings.

7165
06:57:39,360 --> 06:57:40,000
And...

7166
06:57:40,000 --> 06:57:42,840
Today was, like, the last day...

7167
06:57:42,840 --> 06:57:46,280
Like, I've been sending recordings almost every day.

7168
06:57:46,820 --> 06:57:49,080
And today's, like, the last...

7169
06:57:49,080 --> 06:57:50,100
Like, but then I...

7170
06:57:50,100 --> 06:57:51,840
Like, it was just one last recording.

7171
06:57:52,400 --> 06:57:53,340
Is it one last one?

7172
06:57:53,760 --> 06:57:55,080
Yeah, it's one last recording.

7173
06:57:56,900 --> 06:57:57,780
But, like...

7174
06:57:57,780 --> 06:57:59,000
Oh my god, it's...

7175
06:57:59,000 --> 06:58:00,740
Oh my god, I wasted eight minutes for that.

7176
06:58:00,960 --> 06:58:02,140
Oh my god.

7177
06:58:06,960 --> 06:58:07,400
No...

7178
06:58:07,400 --> 06:58:09,620
Guys, we're gonna do it.

7179
06:58:09,920 --> 06:58:11,540
We're gonna do it.

7180
06:58:13,740 --> 06:58:15,580
It was just a lot of work.

7181
06:58:16,480 --> 06:58:18,780
And it helped I was, like, coughing a lot too.

7182
06:58:19,380 --> 06:58:20,440
So, like...

7183
06:58:21,120 --> 06:58:22,700
I couldn't record a lot of stuff.

7184
06:58:23,980 --> 06:58:25,780
I had to, like, pace myself.

7185
06:58:27,360 --> 06:58:28,320
Because, like...

7186
06:58:29,160 --> 06:58:30,120
I also...

7187
06:58:30,120 --> 06:58:31,780
Because, like, I was coughing a lot.

7188
06:58:31,860 --> 06:58:32,920
So I had to pace myself.

7189
06:58:33,000 --> 06:58:34,280
Because if I record too much...

7190
06:58:34,900 --> 06:58:36,900
It got really bad for my throat.

7191
06:58:37,480 --> 06:58:39,820
So then I had to, like...

7192
06:58:40,560 --> 06:58:42,040
That's why I'm locking in now.

7193
06:58:42,800 --> 06:58:44,080
Because I'm locking in.

7194
06:58:44,540 --> 06:58:45,660
Because I know, like...

7195
06:58:45,660 --> 06:58:46,860
Ah, fuck, like...

7196
06:58:46,860 --> 06:58:48,340
I can't keep talk...

7197
06:58:48,340 --> 06:58:49,900
I didn't think it would take this long.

7198
06:58:50,480 --> 06:58:52,260
I thought... I didn't think, like...

7199
06:58:52,260 --> 06:58:54,200
The cutoff would go so fast.

7200
06:58:54,700 --> 06:58:55,440
That's the thing.

7201
06:59:00,280 --> 06:59:01,920
I didn't think that...

7202
06:59:02,820 --> 06:59:04,320
I thought we could just be plat one.

7203
06:59:04,460 --> 06:59:05,580
And it'll be fine.

7204
06:59:06,100 --> 06:59:07,420
But the thing was...

7205
06:59:07,420 --> 06:59:10,280
Who keeps fucking not loading in?

7206
06:59:10,600 --> 06:59:13,780
There's someone in my team that's shitty fucking internet.

7207
06:59:14,300 --> 06:59:14,920
Alright, I'm gonna...

7208
06:59:14,920 --> 06:59:16,640
Oh my god, we have a Wolverine play too.

7209
06:59:17,700 --> 06:59:18,120
What the hell?

7210
06:59:46,530 --> 06:59:47,970
Alright, I'm done.

7211
06:59:48,350 --> 06:59:49,630
I'm not rich as this.

7212
06:59:55,670 --> 06:59:57,410
Oh, recycling the...

7213
06:59:57,990 --> 06:59:59,310
Okay, I'm not gonna mute myself.

7214
06:59:59,450 --> 07:00:00,610
But I'm gonna lock in.

7215
07:00:01,150 --> 07:00:02,070
So I won't talk too much.

7216
07:00:03,050 --> 07:00:04,220
I'll actually try really hard.

7217
07:00:07,710 --> 07:00:10,350
I don't remember what my team was last game.

7218
07:00:11,030 --> 07:00:16,140
Do you die in matches this time?

7219
07:00:16,780 --> 07:00:17,960
Yeah, I'll get one more absolute.

7220
07:00:20,480 --> 07:00:22,120
Just get a good one streak.

7221
07:00:32,660 --> 07:00:33,820
The what?

7222
07:00:41,660 --> 07:00:42,240
How?

7223
07:00:44,100 --> 07:00:44,540
How?

7224
07:00:45,200 --> 07:00:47,920
Like, okay, I guess I don't take the portal.

7225
07:01:16,960 --> 07:01:17,400
Okay.

7226
07:01:18,820 --> 07:01:19,260
Guys.

7227
07:01:19,780 --> 07:01:21,400
I don't think this is...

7228
07:01:21,400 --> 07:01:22,240
Oh my god, this team.

7229
07:01:32,980 --> 07:01:33,960
Like, what is...

7230
07:01:40,540 --> 07:01:42,620
I don't feel good at this, you know?

7231
07:01:43,780 --> 07:01:44,460
Oh.

7232
07:01:45,480 --> 07:01:46,160
What?

7233
07:01:49,360 --> 07:01:50,740
What hit me?

7234
07:01:53,940 --> 07:01:56,880
Wait, is this the same team as my last game?

7235
07:01:57,420 --> 07:01:58,500
Wait, is it really?

7236
07:01:59,200 --> 07:02:00,920
I didn't even notice that.

7237
07:02:02,840 --> 07:02:05,240
This might be a stack then.

7238
07:02:07,340 --> 07:02:08,380
There's no other way.

7239
07:02:08,760 --> 07:02:10,960
This might be a stack if it's the same team.

7240
07:02:12,620 --> 07:02:14,060
They're not talking either, too.

7241
07:02:16,320 --> 07:02:17,820
So unlucky.

7242
07:02:18,800 --> 07:02:19,880
That's actually...

7243
07:02:19,880 --> 07:02:23,480
I'm that unlucky I got my same team as last game?

7244
07:02:27,400 --> 07:02:29,820
Bro, this team is like...

7245
07:02:29,820 --> 07:02:31,740
This team is so...

7246
07:02:31,740 --> 07:02:33,600
I don't know how they're playing.

7247
07:02:34,620 --> 07:02:36,100
They're all just split up.

7248
07:02:36,100 --> 07:02:36,820
Split up.

7249
07:02:41,460 --> 07:02:43,100
Okay, I'm not locked in anymore.

7250
07:02:43,280 --> 07:02:44,560
This team is actually dude.

7251
07:02:44,760 --> 07:02:45,540
Like, shit.

7252
07:02:45,880 --> 07:02:48,160
I was gonna say dude, but I'm like, no, what the fuck?

7253
07:02:49,240 --> 07:02:51,100
It's actually legitimate shit.

7254
07:03:01,940 --> 07:03:03,520
Somebody shoot him!

7255
07:03:03,620 --> 07:03:04,540
Instead of me!

7256
07:03:11,800 --> 07:03:13,500
I'm plat one.

7257
07:03:13,980 --> 07:03:20,840
I'm one tier away from top 500 because top 500 is D3 right now.

7258
07:03:21,320 --> 07:03:22,680
But it sucks because...

7259
07:03:24,080 --> 07:03:26,020
I could have got it.

7260
07:03:26,380 --> 07:03:28,480
But like, something...

7261
07:03:29,200 --> 07:03:30,320
I had two...

7262
07:03:30,320 --> 07:03:32,040
I had games that were a bit trolly.

7263
07:03:43,040 --> 07:03:45,480
No, I could just avoid them.

7264
07:03:46,180 --> 07:03:48,240
I need to avoid the worst player though.

7265
07:03:50,560 --> 07:03:52,020
This last fight...

7266
07:03:52,020 --> 07:03:53,700
This is a really bad team.

7267
07:03:54,020 --> 07:03:54,520
They're so...

7268
07:03:56,720 --> 07:03:58,640
I have to use this.

7269
07:03:58,980 --> 07:03:59,740
Just so like...

7270
07:04:00,720 --> 07:04:01,660
He's alive.

7271
07:04:04,160 --> 07:04:06,680
Just so he can be alive.

7272
07:04:13,580 --> 07:04:15,100
Just attack.

7273
07:04:15,480 --> 07:04:17,160
Legitimately just attack me.

7274
07:04:17,160 --> 07:04:20,220
Like, just tap me.

7275
07:04:21,020 --> 07:04:21,620
Like...

7276
07:04:22,160 --> 07:04:24,560
Just hit me like one time.

7277
07:04:28,140 --> 07:04:29,340
Top 500...

7278
07:04:29,340 --> 07:04:31,080
A lot of people in top 500 just stack.

7279
07:04:31,320 --> 07:04:32,340
So like...

7280
07:04:32,340 --> 07:04:33,500
What the fuck?

7281
07:04:33,520 --> 07:04:34,540
You didn't kill her?

7282
07:04:35,400 --> 07:04:36,520
I'll kill her myself.

7283
07:04:46,570 --> 07:04:49,050
How are there two people behind us?

7284
07:04:52,970 --> 07:04:54,170
Alright, that's fine.

7285
07:04:54,290 --> 07:04:56,110
He's not healing his team.

7286
07:05:07,260 --> 07:05:08,380
That's fine.

7287
07:05:14,080 --> 07:05:14,640
Jesus.

7288
07:05:25,450 --> 07:05:26,610
Alright, that's fine.

7289
07:05:27,010 --> 07:05:27,850
That's fine.

7290
07:05:28,030 --> 07:05:29,870
He is literally not with his team.

7291
07:05:29,870 --> 07:05:31,310
That's fine.

7292
07:05:33,450 --> 07:05:34,550
Kill him.

7293
07:05:34,790 --> 07:05:35,870
That's fine.

7294
07:05:43,840 --> 07:05:45,060
That's fine.

7295
07:05:47,700 --> 07:05:49,460
That's really funny.

7296
07:05:49,600 --> 07:05:50,160
Not gonna lie.

7297
07:05:50,620 --> 07:05:56,120
That's pretty funny.

7298
07:06:05,340 --> 07:06:06,380
That's

7299
07:06:16,380 --> 07:06:18,500
pretty funny.

7300
07:06:18,500 --> 07:06:20,600
Are you

7301
07:06:23,800 --> 07:06:24,600
really serious?

7302
07:06:27,780 --> 07:06:29,040
I can't do anything.

7303
07:06:29,740 --> 07:06:30,640
I can't.

7304
07:06:34,450 --> 07:06:36,990
Oh my gosh.

7305
07:06:37,430 --> 07:06:38,470
Maybe...

7306
07:06:38,470 --> 07:06:39,810
My team got three kills.

7307
07:07:16,400 --> 07:07:18,040
Oh my gosh.

7308
07:07:24,120 --> 07:07:24,740
Alright.

7309
07:07:25,860 --> 07:07:26,200
We're fine.

7310
07:07:26,800 --> 07:07:27,840
We're so fine.

7311
07:07:29,330 --> 07:07:30,440
Oh my god, this team.

7312
07:07:30,580 --> 07:07:31,240
I can't.

7313
07:07:31,480 --> 07:07:33,260
I can't deal with this team.

7314
07:07:33,660 --> 07:07:35,460
This team is so special.

7315
07:07:35,720 --> 07:07:36,660
I can't.

7316
07:07:37,820 --> 07:07:38,860
I can't.

7317
07:07:38,960 --> 07:07:41,300
I have to like actually focus so much.

7318
07:07:47,060 --> 07:07:48,000
I have ult.

7319
07:07:56,280 --> 07:07:57,120
How?

7320
07:07:58,620 --> 07:08:00,100
Oh no.

7321
07:08:00,340 --> 07:08:01,440
We double ulted.

7322
07:08:01,900 --> 07:08:03,240
That's really bad.

7323
07:08:06,360 --> 07:08:08,520
We double support ulted.

7324
07:08:10,100 --> 07:08:11,200
This is so bad.

7325
07:08:11,580 --> 07:08:13,100
Oh, this is so bad.

7326
07:08:15,380 --> 07:08:19,140
I didn't think she would support ult too.

7327
07:08:26,120 --> 07:08:26,700
I'm running.

7328
07:08:27,180 --> 07:08:28,200
I'm fucking skiing.

7329
07:08:28,220 --> 07:08:29,660
Skate, girl.

7330
07:08:29,860 --> 07:08:30,260
Skate.

7331
07:08:30,820 --> 07:08:31,680
Skate, girl.

7332
07:08:31,940 --> 07:08:32,540
Skate.

7333
07:08:34,740 --> 07:08:36,420
You have to touch it.

7334
07:08:36,860 --> 07:08:39,480
It's your fucking...

7335
07:08:42,640 --> 07:08:44,460
Why are you not touching it?

7336
07:08:44,560 --> 07:08:46,460
Why did you wait the DPS?

7337
07:08:47,140 --> 07:08:48,900
You're such a fucking...

7338
07:08:48,900 --> 07:08:50,280
I'm avoiding this guy.

7339
07:08:50,880 --> 07:08:52,380
I'm avoiding Captain Koi.

7340
07:08:52,880 --> 07:08:54,420
That's the first guy I'm avoiding.

7341
07:08:59,240 --> 07:09:00,000
Oh my god.

7342
07:09:00,540 --> 07:09:02,860
Why the fuck did he turn around?

7343
07:09:04,400 --> 07:09:05,540
I'm gonna look you up.

7344
07:09:06,960 --> 07:09:07,620
Oh, I can't.

7345
07:09:07,640 --> 07:09:09,720
I wish you can like look people up.

7346
07:09:09,780 --> 07:09:10,460
Wait, maybe?

7347
07:09:12,260 --> 07:09:13,120
Oh, I can't.

7348
07:09:13,140 --> 07:09:14,080
I can't look at history.

7349
07:09:14,800 --> 07:09:15,740
I'm gonna look at your profile.

7350
07:09:15,860 --> 07:09:16,740
I'm gonna examine your profile.

7351
07:09:16,780 --> 07:09:17,780
I'm gonna be so fucking toxic.

7352
07:09:17,940 --> 07:09:18,920
I'm gonna look at your profile.

7353
07:09:20,000 --> 07:09:21,140
After this game is over.

7354
07:09:30,590 --> 07:09:30,970
Alright.

7355
07:09:33,410 --> 07:09:35,170
That was such an insane throw.

7356
07:09:35,230 --> 07:09:36,810
To be fair, we have fucking Wolverine.

7357
07:09:36,810 --> 07:09:37,810
But like...

7358
07:09:40,150 --> 07:09:41,230
We have...

7359
07:09:41,230 --> 07:09:44,810
Okay, I either avoid the Wolverine or I avoid the fucking...

7360
07:09:46,490 --> 07:09:48,110
I don't know which one.

7361
07:09:48,970 --> 07:09:50,610
They're both pretty fucking terrible.

7362
07:09:57,920 --> 07:09:59,580
They're both pretty bad.

7363
07:10:08,840 --> 07:10:10,020
Oh my god.

7364
07:10:11,640 --> 07:10:13,840
I'm just getting griefed right now.

7365
07:10:14,400 --> 07:10:16,200
By unlucky matchmaking.

7366
07:10:28,500 --> 07:10:29,920
Look who just shook.

7367
07:10:31,500 --> 07:10:33,700
Why didn't you fight him?

7368
07:10:38,280 --> 07:10:39,220
I'm fucking losing.

7369
07:10:39,320 --> 07:10:41,340
I saw that and I was like, I'm fucking gone.

7370
07:10:41,840 --> 07:10:42,760
Good luck guys.

7371
07:10:49,830 --> 07:10:50,510
Please keep up.

7372
07:10:50,610 --> 07:10:51,310
Just keep him up.

7373
07:10:51,690 --> 07:10:53,890
He is the most important person in our lineup.

7374
07:10:54,070 --> 07:10:55,150
He's really our only tank.

7375
07:10:56,190 --> 07:10:57,430
Just keep this guy up.

7376
07:10:58,710 --> 07:10:59,830
That's all that matters.

7377
07:11:05,350 --> 07:11:06,650
Like who cares about...

7378
07:11:06,650 --> 07:11:08,750
Oh my god, please.

7379
07:11:11,110 --> 07:11:13,690
Guys, I need you guys to kill one person.

7380
07:11:14,570 --> 07:11:14,970
Please.

7381
07:11:16,650 --> 07:11:20,890
I need you guys to kill one guy for us.

7382
07:11:29,210 --> 07:11:32,530
Okay, if anything, we should get Moon Knight to fucking change.

7383
07:11:32,610 --> 07:11:33,450
He's fucking terrible.

7384
07:11:35,550 --> 07:11:37,910
Honestly, I'd say just fucking change Moon Knight.

7385
07:11:39,590 --> 07:11:40,890
He's actually terrible.

7386
07:11:50,500 --> 07:11:51,520
I heard her.

7387
07:11:52,000 --> 07:11:53,040
I was just like, fuck that.

7388
07:11:53,140 --> 07:11:54,060
I cannot be bothered.

7389
07:11:54,520 --> 07:11:56,480
I can't be bothered to hear that.

7390
07:11:56,600 --> 07:11:57,660
Starts clicking heals.

7391
07:11:59,240 --> 07:12:02,440
I cannot be bothered to hear her fucking heals clicking.

7392
07:12:05,400 --> 07:12:05,960
Goodbye.

7393
07:12:07,500 --> 07:12:08,400
Oh, thank god.

7394
07:12:08,600 --> 07:12:09,400
Hello again.

7395
07:12:12,260 --> 07:12:13,160
You know what?

7396
07:12:13,240 --> 07:12:13,680
Fuck this.

7397
07:12:13,720 --> 07:12:14,320
I'm dancing.

7398
07:12:16,240 --> 07:12:17,400
I'm just gonna dance.

7399
07:12:18,280 --> 07:12:19,440
We're fighting this.

7400
07:12:36,180 --> 07:12:37,530
Jesus Christ.

7401
07:12:39,210 --> 07:12:40,800
How many ults?

7402
07:12:42,300 --> 07:12:44,380
How many fucking ults, guys?

7403
07:12:46,140 --> 07:12:47,840
Oh, I thought he was closer.

7404
07:12:53,460 --> 07:12:53,910
Please.

7405
07:12:54,310 --> 07:12:54,770
Please.

7406
07:12:58,300 --> 07:13:00,670
We danced the pain away.

7407
07:13:00,670 --> 07:13:04,690
We actually danced the pain away.

7408
07:13:05,390 --> 07:13:06,530
Oh my god.

7409
07:13:07,130 --> 07:13:09,730
We're gonna dance it all away.

7410
07:13:10,930 --> 07:13:14,390
This has to be the worst team I've ever got.

7411
07:13:14,870 --> 07:13:18,970
And I had a team that was like, swap Spiderman or I throw.

7412
07:13:19,550 --> 07:13:22,990
Oh yeah, swap the tank or I throw my game.

7413
07:13:23,990 --> 07:13:26,110
But no, this has to be the worst team.

7414
07:13:26,350 --> 07:13:29,050
Because individually, they're all fucking terrible players.

7415
07:13:29,050 --> 07:13:35,070
Like individually, in the other ones, at least the other players are actually good.

7416
07:13:36,030 --> 07:13:36,590
Individually.

7417
07:13:36,770 --> 07:13:40,390
But these guys, individually, these guys are all fucking terrible.

7418
07:13:48,060 --> 07:13:49,560
Like, kill him!

7419
07:13:50,560 --> 07:13:51,840
Oh my god, help!

7420
07:13:51,940 --> 07:13:54,140
Oh my god, I'm actually gonna fucking shoot you.

7421
07:13:55,120 --> 07:13:57,500
How bad are you?

7422
07:14:01,860 --> 07:14:04,720
Oh my god, I thought I could hide from the wall.

7423
07:14:13,700 --> 07:14:15,520
Oh my god, you're all...

7424
07:14:16,720 --> 07:14:17,360
Okay.

7425
07:14:18,060 --> 07:14:18,380
Alright.

7426
07:14:19,740 --> 07:14:20,600
Poor games.

7427
07:14:25,240 --> 07:14:26,520
Oh my...

7428
07:14:26,520 --> 07:14:27,940
Wolverine, guys.

7429
07:14:28,180 --> 07:14:29,200
It's not just...

7430
07:14:29,200 --> 07:14:30,840
I don't think they don't realize.

7431
07:14:31,620 --> 07:14:33,360
It's not just the Wolverine.

7432
07:14:33,520 --> 07:14:37,780
Our Moonlight player was just as fucking ass.

7433
07:14:37,780 --> 07:14:40,680
There's no way.

7434
07:14:41,360 --> 07:14:41,960
Our...

7435
07:14:41,960 --> 07:14:43,460
Oh my god.

7436
07:14:43,820 --> 07:14:45,280
Holy shit.

7437
07:14:45,440 --> 07:14:49,300
Wait, our fucking Psylocke player was ass too?

7438
07:14:51,520 --> 07:14:53,140
Oh my god.

7439
07:14:53,840 --> 07:14:54,300
Alright.

7440
07:14:54,780 --> 07:14:55,860
Avoid as player.

7441
07:14:56,600 --> 07:14:56,920
Okay.

7442
07:14:57,480 --> 07:14:58,660
Oh my god.

7443
07:14:59,500 --> 07:15:00,700
Oh my god.

7444
07:15:02,860 --> 07:15:05,500
Wolverine was actually the worst player.

7445
07:15:07,640 --> 07:15:08,200
Moon...

7446
07:15:08,200 --> 07:15:09,980
I thought Moonlight was doing nothing.

7447
07:15:10,840 --> 07:15:12,980
But he actually did the most.

7448
07:15:13,360 --> 07:15:14,420
He felt like...

7449
07:15:14,420 --> 07:15:16,320
He felt so useless to me.

7450
07:15:18,920 --> 07:15:19,800
Holy fuck.

7451
07:15:19,900 --> 07:15:21,060
Okay, I avoided the Wolverine.

7452
07:15:22,420 --> 07:15:23,180
Oh yeah.

7453
07:15:23,440 --> 07:15:24,380
I need to look at his profile.

7454
07:15:25,320 --> 07:15:26,120
How do I look at his profile?

7455
07:15:27,020 --> 07:15:27,300
Wait.

7456
07:15:27,720 --> 07:15:29,300
How do I look at his profile?

7457
07:15:29,920 --> 07:15:30,220
Can I?

7458
07:15:32,140 --> 07:15:33,200
I thought I can.

7459
07:15:34,100 --> 07:15:35,640
Oh, I have to be in the history.

7460
07:15:37,840 --> 07:15:38,440
Guys, no.

7461
07:15:38,540 --> 07:15:39,460
It won't be possible.

7462
07:15:39,780 --> 07:15:41,460
I believe I can do this.

7463
07:15:41,580 --> 07:15:42,380
Jesus Christ.

7464
07:15:42,680 --> 07:15:43,660
Oh my god.

7465
07:15:43,720 --> 07:15:45,600
This is not looking so good right here.

7466
07:15:51,380 --> 07:15:53,620
We're both like...

7467
07:15:53,620 --> 07:15:53,900
Okay.

7468
07:15:54,520 --> 07:15:56,280
He has a 50% win rate?

7469
07:15:56,500 --> 07:15:57,240
Oh my god.

7470
07:15:59,220 --> 07:16:00,800
Oh, you can't see his statistic.

7471
07:16:01,000 --> 07:16:01,640
Good for him.

7472
07:16:01,880 --> 07:16:02,920
I was about to be toxic.

7473
07:16:03,200 --> 07:16:04,400
What about this guy?

7474
07:16:10,100 --> 07:16:12,780
I mean, that's not 50% at least.

7475
07:16:14,440 --> 07:16:16,000
But you're a Wolverine one trick.

7476
07:16:16,160 --> 07:16:17,960
Which is one of the worst characters you can play.

7477
07:16:26,960 --> 07:16:27,960
Oh no.

7478
07:16:29,940 --> 07:16:30,940
Oh no.

7479
07:16:31,120 --> 07:16:31,400
Okay.

7480
07:16:32,800 --> 07:16:33,480
How far?

7481
07:16:33,660 --> 07:16:34,380
Four games.

7482
07:16:35,580 --> 07:16:36,740
Four games.

7483
07:16:38,620 --> 07:16:39,640
It's Diamond 3.

7484
07:16:41,060 --> 07:16:44,120
It's literally the edge of Diamond 3.

7485
07:16:45,040 --> 07:16:47,060
Yeah, everything is Diamond 3.

7486
07:16:47,420 --> 07:16:48,060
Everything.

7487
07:16:48,400 --> 07:16:50,240
Everything is Diamond 3.

7488
07:16:50,840 --> 07:16:53,440
Like, the moment we hit Diamond 3, it was there.

7489
07:16:57,000 --> 07:16:58,680
Oh my god.

7490
07:16:59,760 --> 07:17:01,060
Come on.

7491
07:17:03,820 --> 07:17:05,420
Come on.

7492
07:17:06,000 --> 07:17:07,740
I need Diamond 3.

7493
07:17:09,340 --> 07:17:11,400
I need Diamond 3.

7494
07:17:11,400 --> 07:17:12,060
I need Diamond 3.

7495
07:17:16,500 --> 07:17:18,400
This is where it's gonna change.

7496
07:17:21,990 --> 07:17:23,250
I believe in us.

7497
07:17:23,610 --> 07:17:25,390
I believe in you guys.

7498
07:17:30,160 --> 07:17:31,220
No, this is it.

7499
07:17:31,360 --> 07:17:32,080
This is it.

7500
07:17:32,260 --> 07:17:33,260
This is...

7501
07:17:33,260 --> 07:17:34,300
This is it.

7502
07:17:36,820 --> 07:17:37,320
Alright.

7503
07:17:37,740 --> 07:17:40,360
I'll get up after this game and stretch a little.

7504
07:17:43,440 --> 07:17:47,180
The worst part is that I am like back where I started.

7505
07:17:48,960 --> 07:17:50,120
Like, not back where I started.

7506
07:17:50,700 --> 07:17:51,960
But I'm back where...

7507
07:17:54,000 --> 07:17:55,120
Surefour left.

7508
07:17:55,440 --> 07:17:56,760
Because I got so close.

7509
07:17:56,940 --> 07:17:57,660
After he left.

7510
07:17:58,200 --> 07:17:59,940
This is where I was.

7511
07:18:00,260 --> 07:18:02,340
This is where I was after I left.

7512
07:18:02,520 --> 07:18:03,060
Okay, sure.

7513
07:18:04,180 --> 07:18:04,660
Alright.

7514
07:18:05,180 --> 07:18:06,240
Let's do Jeff.

7515
07:18:06,380 --> 07:18:07,300
Today's a Jeff day.

7516
07:18:07,640 --> 07:18:08,280
Might as well.

7517
07:18:12,100 --> 07:18:14,960
Might as well fucking Jeff it up.

7518
07:18:16,040 --> 07:18:17,720
Gotta do something different today.

7519
07:18:19,520 --> 07:18:22,020
Is that the rule of who...

7520
07:18:22,860 --> 07:18:26,080
No, when he left, top 500 was still...

7521
07:18:26,080 --> 07:18:28,460
Top 500 was still plat 1.

7522
07:18:28,720 --> 07:18:29,700
That's the thing.

7523
07:18:30,220 --> 07:18:33,180
When he left, top 500 was still fucking...

7524
07:18:33,180 --> 07:18:33,620
I'm avoiding.

7525
07:18:34,000 --> 07:18:35,680
I'm avoiding so I can play Luna next game.

7526
07:18:36,140 --> 07:18:36,960
Was still...

7527
07:18:40,260 --> 07:18:42,580
Top 500 was still plat 1.

7528
07:18:42,860 --> 07:18:43,940
And then we kept going.

7529
07:18:44,100 --> 07:18:46,000
And now top 500 is Diamond 4.

7530
07:18:46,540 --> 07:18:47,100
So...

7531
07:18:47,100 --> 07:18:48,280
Or Diamond 3.

7532
07:18:48,960 --> 07:18:51,160
Top 500 is Diamond 3.

7533
07:19:01,660 --> 07:19:02,300
Alright.

7534
07:19:04,400 --> 07:19:06,960
Okay, this is a good Jeff map though.

7535
07:19:08,420 --> 07:19:10,820
This is a really good Jeff map because I can...

7536
07:19:10,820 --> 07:19:12,800
I can throw people off.

7537
07:19:17,340 --> 07:19:17,980
Alright.

7538
07:19:18,420 --> 07:19:18,980
That's fine.

7539
07:19:27,040 --> 07:19:28,220
Jesus Christ.

7540
07:19:28,380 --> 07:19:29,820
What is going on?

7541
07:19:30,920 --> 07:19:33,620
How many fucking tings do I have to reload my mouse?

7542
07:19:37,460 --> 07:19:38,600
Oh my god.

7543
07:19:38,680 --> 07:19:40,140
We lost our two supports.

7544
07:19:40,420 --> 07:19:41,000
Which is me.

7545
07:19:41,780 --> 07:19:42,780
And our Luna.

7546
07:19:45,020 --> 07:19:46,660
I should not have stayed there.

7547
07:19:50,360 --> 07:19:52,340
Okay, I actually need to lock in though.

7548
07:19:52,880 --> 07:19:54,340
I'm not playing my main.

7549
07:20:03,080 --> 07:20:04,500
Can't headshot when I'm underground.

7550
07:20:16,100 --> 07:20:17,060
Jesus Christ.

7551
07:20:17,140 --> 07:20:18,940
I looked away for one second.

7552
07:20:19,220 --> 07:20:19,460
Really?

7553
07:20:26,580 --> 07:20:27,520
Oh my god.

7554
07:20:27,560 --> 07:20:29,100
I had to reload my mouse.

7555
07:20:34,960 --> 07:20:36,960
Oh, I didn't see the bomb!

7556
07:20:41,120 --> 07:20:43,920
I think three tings is not it.

7557
07:20:44,440 --> 07:20:44,900
I don't...

7558
07:20:45,920 --> 07:20:47,680
I think I have to play Cloak and Dagger.

7559
07:20:48,680 --> 07:20:51,340
Because there's not enough heals for three tings.

7560
07:20:59,520 --> 07:21:02,060
There's actually not enough heals.

7561
07:21:13,230 --> 07:21:15,410
I don't know what else to do.

7562
07:21:16,430 --> 07:21:18,790
I don't know what else to do.

7563
07:21:19,210 --> 07:21:19,850
Okay.

7564
07:21:24,010 --> 07:21:25,170
I don't think...

7565
07:21:25,170 --> 07:21:26,450
I think I have to play Cloak and Dagger.

7566
07:21:27,870 --> 07:21:28,490
Three tings...

7567
07:21:28,490 --> 07:21:29,790
Oh, we have two tings now.

7568
07:21:29,910 --> 07:21:30,230
Okay.

7569
07:21:32,170 --> 07:21:33,450
No way!

7570
07:21:35,450 --> 07:21:38,030
They mined the entire thing up!

7571
07:21:46,210 --> 07:21:47,390
Alright, it's time to learn.

7572
07:21:48,250 --> 07:21:49,730
It's time to learn.

7573
07:21:51,350 --> 07:21:52,870
I got death counted!

7574
07:21:53,450 --> 07:21:55,570
The mines actually counted me!

7575
07:21:58,010 --> 07:21:59,250
Oh my god.

7576
07:22:00,390 --> 07:22:02,030
I need to avoid all Luna players.

7577
07:22:04,290 --> 07:22:06,810
They know what they are going for when they ask for Luna.

7578
07:22:07,130 --> 07:22:08,270
And I insta-lock Luna.

7579
07:22:19,090 --> 07:22:19,690
No!

7580
07:22:20,290 --> 07:22:20,770
No!

7581
07:22:21,230 --> 07:22:22,790
Winstreet starts next game!

7582
07:22:23,750 --> 07:22:25,830
I've just been unlucky with...

7583
07:22:25,830 --> 07:22:29,490
I don't know how I've been unlucky with teammates four games in a row.

7584
07:22:29,650 --> 07:22:30,970
I've just been very unlucky.

7585
07:22:33,770 --> 07:22:35,510
I wish you can avoid more people.

7586
07:22:36,250 --> 07:22:36,810
That's why like...

7587
07:22:36,810 --> 07:22:38,270
No, everybody stacks now.

7588
07:22:38,470 --> 07:22:39,330
In top 500.

7589
07:22:39,530 --> 07:22:40,310
It's so annoying.

7590
07:22:40,530 --> 07:22:41,350
Or like to...

7591
07:22:41,350 --> 07:22:42,270
Or close to...

7592
07:22:42,270 --> 07:22:43,710
People close to top 500.

7593
07:22:43,950 --> 07:22:45,130
Or like in top 500.

7594
07:22:45,370 --> 07:22:46,550
They just all stack.

7595
07:22:47,870 --> 07:22:49,110
That's what I was like doing.

7596
07:22:49,110 --> 07:22:50,470
Because like...

7597
07:22:50,470 --> 07:22:51,590
It's so annoying.

7598
07:22:52,790 --> 07:22:54,710
I mean, he's the only one making the portal.

7599
07:22:59,310 --> 07:23:01,270
No one else went to the portal.

7600
07:23:01,370 --> 07:23:02,650
I'm sorry, Dr. Strange.

7601
07:23:03,030 --> 07:23:03,690
I'm sorry.

7602
07:23:03,950 --> 07:23:05,350
We didn't care about your portal.

7603
07:23:13,680 --> 07:23:14,320
I'm sorry.

7604
07:23:25,410 --> 07:23:25,930
What?!

7605
07:23:27,860 --> 07:23:29,580
Where's my DPS players?!

7606
07:23:30,620 --> 07:23:31,060
Wait, wait!

7607
07:23:31,180 --> 07:23:33,220
None of our DPS got kills!

7608
07:23:34,300 --> 07:23:34,980
Wait, you're right!

7609
07:23:38,700 --> 07:23:40,280
Oh my god!

7610
07:23:41,000 --> 07:23:43,080
None of them got kills!

7611
07:23:43,240 --> 07:23:44,460
You're fucking right!

7612
07:23:46,980 --> 07:23:47,740
I

7613
07:24:09,360 --> 07:24:14,300
don't think we win this, guys.

7614
07:24:21,740 --> 07:24:23,260
It's just...

7615
07:24:23,260 --> 07:24:24,960
It's just life.

7616
07:24:26,340 --> 07:24:28,120
It's just life, guys.

7617
07:24:34,540 --> 07:24:35,880
I just...

7618
07:24:35,880 --> 07:24:37,360
I never stop left-clicking.

7619
07:24:37,660 --> 07:24:40,320
I never stop left-clicking!

7620
07:24:40,880 --> 07:24:43,000
I just left-click forever.

7621
07:24:47,420 --> 07:24:50,100
You'll be fine, Dr. Strange!

7622
07:24:50,520 --> 07:24:52,240
No cloak, just dagger.

7623
07:24:52,780 --> 07:24:54,800
Guys, we really need the heals.

7624
07:24:55,240 --> 07:24:55,960
Like...

7625
07:24:55,960 --> 07:24:59,900
Legitimately, if I don't stop left-clicking, we fucking die.

7626
07:25:00,380 --> 07:25:01,020
Like...

7627
07:25:04,500 --> 07:25:05,100
It's...

7628
07:25:05,100 --> 07:25:07,760
It's sadly how we have to do it.

7629
07:25:08,580 --> 07:25:09,640
Alright, look, see?

7630
07:25:10,260 --> 07:25:11,140
He dies.

7631
07:25:17,830 --> 07:25:19,430
At least I'm learning cloak.

7632
07:25:24,240 --> 07:25:24,840
Guys...

7633
07:25:24,840 --> 07:25:26,020
It's just...

7634
07:25:26,020 --> 07:25:28,020
It's just how it goes.

7635
07:25:29,180 --> 07:25:31,500
It's just how we gotta deal with it.

7636
07:25:36,040 --> 07:25:37,360
Oh my god!

7637
07:25:38,360 --> 07:25:41,300
No dagger, only cloak.

7638
07:25:48,130 --> 07:25:51,050
So nothing died, ever.

7639
07:25:52,090 --> 07:25:53,470
That's so true!

7640
07:25:54,210 --> 07:25:56,410
That's so fucking true!

7641
07:25:57,030 --> 07:25:59,050
Nothing ever fucking died!

7642
07:25:59,370 --> 07:26:00,570
Oh my god!

7643
07:26:02,290 --> 07:26:05,070
Oh my god, I just need to keep avoiding all the...

7644
07:26:05,070 --> 07:26:07,530
I just need to keep avoiding all the Luna players.

7645
07:26:07,530 --> 07:26:09,270
That's the only way.

7646
07:26:14,560 --> 07:26:15,440
Mantis is too hard.

7647
07:26:16,440 --> 07:26:17,250
I can't learn cloak...

7648
07:26:17,920 --> 07:26:19,700
I can't learn mantis...

7649
07:26:19,700 --> 07:26:20,480
Um...

7650
07:26:20,480 --> 07:26:21,720
Intent for this ELO.

7651
07:26:41,200 --> 07:26:43,080
Oh yeah, no, I forgot to get up!

7652
07:26:43,160 --> 07:26:44,160
I forgot to get up and stretch!

7653
07:26:44,640 --> 07:26:44,860
No!

7654
07:26:51,480 --> 07:26:54,100
Oh my god...

7655
07:26:56,500 --> 07:26:59,760
I forgot to get up and stretch...

7656
07:27:00,440 --> 07:27:00,900
Fuck...

7657
07:27:06,690 --> 07:27:07,410
Oh...

7658
07:27:08,010 --> 07:27:10,610
I need to lock in my character!

7659
07:27:24,090 --> 07:27:24,810
Okay...

7660
07:27:24,810 --> 07:27:25,590
Oh!

7661
07:27:27,450 --> 07:27:29,190
Okay, I'm gonna stretch right now.

7662
07:27:29,590 --> 07:27:29,950
Ah!

7663
07:27:30,910 --> 07:27:32,250
I'm gonna stretch right now.

7664
07:27:35,250 --> 07:27:35,970
Hmm...

7665
07:27:40,520 --> 07:27:41,280
Ah...

7666
07:27:41,280 --> 07:27:41,900
Okay.

7667
07:27:54,870 --> 07:27:55,190
Alright.

7668
07:27:58,290 --> 07:28:00,450
Alright, maybe we have DPS players.

7669
07:28:01,550 --> 07:28:02,310
Maybe...

7670
07:28:02,310 --> 07:28:04,330
Maybe we have DPS players now.

7671
07:28:05,130 --> 07:28:06,830
Maybe we have...

7672
07:28:06,830 --> 07:28:09,090
Maybe we have DPS players.

7673
07:28:14,780 --> 07:28:16,200
It'll be different.

7674
07:28:17,840 --> 07:28:19,760
We'll have DPS players this time.

7675
07:28:20,500 --> 07:28:21,060
I believe.

7676
07:28:23,040 --> 07:28:23,480
I believe.

7677
07:28:25,480 --> 07:28:27,120
What the fuck do I power up?

7678
07:28:27,120 --> 07:28:28,180
Oh, let's just power up Thor.

7679
07:28:28,840 --> 07:28:32,160
Actually, I don't know, because they're both flankered tanks.

7680
07:28:36,410 --> 07:28:40,690
They're both like tanks that flank, so it's like I don't know who...

7681
07:28:41,170 --> 07:28:42,310
Who I should go to.

7682
07:28:51,260 --> 07:28:53,580
Okay, who's like farther up?

7683
07:28:56,840 --> 07:28:58,220
Okay, I should give it to Thor then.

7684
07:29:03,230 --> 07:29:04,330
Oh, nice.

7685
07:29:11,570 --> 07:29:12,250
Okay.

7686
07:29:12,930 --> 07:29:13,770
I'm sorry, I have to heal.

7687
07:29:14,630 --> 07:29:15,110
Nice.

7688
07:29:20,130 --> 07:29:20,630
C'mon.

7689
07:29:21,330 --> 07:29:22,710
Just kill something, anything.

7690
07:29:23,870 --> 07:29:25,330
Just kill something, anything.

7691
07:29:26,490 --> 07:29:29,650
That's fine, we're just... we're just gonna dance.

7692
07:29:30,870 --> 07:29:31,930
Oh my god.

7693
07:29:33,430 --> 07:29:36,430
Holy shit, he does so much damage.

7694
07:29:37,910 --> 07:29:38,990
Okay, I have to go now.

7695
07:29:51,880 --> 07:29:53,280
Oh, nothing is dying.

7696
07:29:53,880 --> 07:29:55,760
Nothing is dying and I'm scared.

7697
07:29:56,100 --> 07:29:56,320
No!

7698
07:29:56,920 --> 07:29:58,220
But I'm dying!

7699
07:30:04,620 --> 07:30:05,140
Okay.

7700
07:30:12,670 --> 07:30:13,190
This is fun.

7701
07:30:16,370 --> 07:30:16,890
How?

7702
07:30:17,490 --> 07:30:18,270
Wait, what?

7703
07:30:19,550 --> 07:30:21,210
Oh, it's the low-key ult.

7704
07:30:21,270 --> 07:30:22,010
I was like, what?

7705
07:30:22,150 --> 07:30:23,190
Why did he waste that?

7706
07:30:26,350 --> 07:30:27,890
Okay, I put it...

7707
07:30:27,890 --> 07:30:29,430
Where did I put the...

7708
07:30:29,430 --> 07:30:31,570
Not venom, I did not put it on venom.

7709
07:30:32,350 --> 07:30:33,230
I need to put it on venom.

7710
07:30:33,930 --> 07:30:34,330
Okay.

7711
07:30:35,830 --> 07:30:37,510
Please, can we have a normal tank?

7712
07:30:37,850 --> 07:30:39,530
Can we have...

7713
07:30:39,530 --> 07:30:42,090
Can we have a normal tank?

7714
07:30:51,770 --> 07:30:53,130
Like, what are you...

7715
07:30:53,130 --> 07:30:54,190
Why are you looking at me?

7716
07:30:54,410 --> 07:30:55,490
Why are you looking at me?

7717
07:30:56,210 --> 07:30:57,610
Help your buddy!

7718
07:30:58,110 --> 07:30:59,210
Help him!

7719
07:30:59,990 --> 07:31:01,110
Why are you...

7720
07:31:01,110 --> 07:31:01,250
Oh!

7721
07:31:10,260 --> 07:31:11,040
Guys.

7722
07:31:11,600 --> 07:31:13,680
How do I get...

7723
07:31:17,040 --> 07:31:18,680
Guys, what's my RNG?

7724
07:31:19,300 --> 07:31:19,880
Really?

7725
07:31:21,480 --> 07:31:24,720
How is my RNG this bad with teammates?

7726
07:31:25,100 --> 07:31:26,980
Like, four games in a row.

7727
07:31:27,620 --> 07:31:28,820
This is actually crazy.

7728
07:31:31,660 --> 07:31:33,620
Hire a DPS player?

7729
07:31:34,160 --> 07:31:37,860
I don't know anyone that's awake at this hour that's gonna play.

7730
07:31:39,840 --> 07:31:42,120
I legitimately think I just need a DPS player.

7731
07:31:42,440 --> 07:31:46,680
Because I've been getting tank players that don't know how to play.

7732
07:31:47,100 --> 07:31:47,820
Bro, I...

7733
07:31:56,010 --> 07:31:56,650
Okay.

7734
07:32:00,230 --> 07:32:02,110
Okay, I'm alive somehow.

7735
07:32:03,490 --> 07:32:06,350
That's crazy that I'm alive somehow.

7736
07:32:10,560 --> 07:32:11,300
That's...

7737
07:32:11,300 --> 07:32:11,700
Oh!

7738
07:32:12,380 --> 07:32:14,040
My god!

7739
07:32:18,280 --> 07:32:21,100
Bro, at this point I don't even have a team.

7740
07:32:27,670 --> 07:32:28,410
Bro!

7741
07:32:28,750 --> 07:32:30,210
What is my team?

7742
07:32:31,350 --> 07:32:31,670
Oh!

7743
07:32:43,550 --> 07:32:44,870
Oh my god.

7744
07:32:45,490 --> 07:32:46,770
Oh my god.

7745
07:32:47,030 --> 07:32:47,750
Oh my god!

7746
07:32:47,750 --> 07:32:48,230
I can't.

7747
07:32:48,510 --> 07:32:48,990
I can't.

7748
07:32:49,030 --> 07:32:50,890
I don't think I'm underperforming.

7749
07:32:50,990 --> 07:32:52,510
Am I underperforming?

7750
07:32:52,730 --> 07:32:54,390
I don't feel like I am.

7751
07:32:57,510 --> 07:32:58,390
Oh my god.

7752
07:32:58,470 --> 07:33:00,370
I'm fucking trying to find DPS players right now.

7753
07:33:00,990 --> 07:33:02,210
Or tank player.

7754
07:33:02,570 --> 07:33:02,950
I think...

7755
07:33:02,950 --> 07:33:03,450
I don't care.

7756
07:33:03,450 --> 07:33:09,710
I just want to duo with either a DPS or a tank player, so at least one slot isn't a fucking Luna player.

7757
07:33:10,090 --> 07:33:12,850
Like, and I get three more avoids.

7758
07:33:13,110 --> 07:33:14,890
I get three more avoids.

7759
07:33:14,970 --> 07:33:16,270
I need more avoids slots.

7760
07:33:23,700 --> 07:33:24,380
I don't know.

7761
07:33:24,460 --> 07:33:25,880
I don't think I'm underperforming.

7762
07:33:25,960 --> 07:33:27,280
I feel like I'm playing...

7763
07:33:30,140 --> 07:33:32,160
I feel like I'm playing the same.

7764
07:33:32,160 --> 07:33:34,160
I'm playing...

7765
07:33:44,920 --> 07:33:45,640
All right.

7766
07:33:52,350 --> 07:33:53,470
This is what I do.

7767
07:33:53,570 --> 07:33:55,830
I know, like, I could use the stairs, but this is faster.

7768
07:33:58,170 --> 07:34:00,610
Oh, now you'll play fucking Penny?

7769
07:34:03,930 --> 07:34:05,010
How much do you do rank?

7770
07:34:05,070 --> 07:34:05,810
Do you do rank fully?

7771
07:34:06,570 --> 07:34:07,170
I hope not.

7772
07:34:07,670 --> 07:34:09,270
I've never did rank before, so...

7773
07:34:10,090 --> 07:34:10,650
I hope not.

7774
07:34:10,730 --> 07:34:11,190
There, see?

7775
07:34:12,070 --> 07:34:12,430
Easy.

7776
07:34:19,320 --> 07:34:27,260
I just think we're ha- we have, like, we had Venom and Thor, and Venom and Thor are both like, uh...

7777
07:34:27,260 --> 07:34:29,240
They're, like, off tanks, I feel like.

7778
07:34:29,480 --> 07:34:30,740
They're not main tanks.

7779
07:34:31,560 --> 07:34:35,860
I think, like, Doctor Strange and Magneto are both really good.

7780
07:34:36,460 --> 07:34:36,940
What?

7781
07:34:38,460 --> 07:34:41,200
How did you die so fast?

7782
07:34:44,040 --> 07:34:44,640
How?

7783
07:34:45,860 --> 07:34:46,460
What?

7784
07:34:46,460 --> 07:34:47,220
God.

7785
07:34:55,470 --> 07:34:56,010
Jesus.

7786
07:34:59,370 --> 07:34:59,910
See?

7787
07:35:00,070 --> 07:35:02,410
She doesn't play Cloak in Cloak and Dagger.

7788
07:35:08,010 --> 07:35:08,550
Okay.

7789
07:35:08,770 --> 07:35:09,250
I'm okay.

7790
07:35:09,910 --> 07:35:10,450
For now.

7791
07:35:14,380 --> 07:35:14,920
Okay.

7792
07:35:15,680 --> 07:35:16,080
Thor.

7793
07:35:16,600 --> 07:35:18,260
Thor, I don't like that, Thor.

7794
07:35:19,080 --> 07:35:20,180
Nope, goodbye, Thor.

7795
07:35:20,960 --> 07:35:22,900
I don't know what you expected there, bro.

7796
07:35:23,960 --> 07:35:26,080
I'm assuming you don't know what you expected.

7797
07:35:26,380 --> 07:35:30,160
I'm gonna drop down because I can tell they wanted to- yeah.

7798
07:35:33,160 --> 07:35:34,940
I could tell they wanted to push me there.

7799
07:35:38,740 --> 07:35:39,420
Alright.

7800
07:35:43,040 --> 07:35:43,460
Loki?

7801
07:35:43,660 --> 07:35:45,100
I don't think Loki's good.

7802
07:35:45,440 --> 07:35:45,920
IMO.

7803
07:35:46,260 --> 07:35:48,100
Oh my god, Thor.

7804
07:35:48,940 --> 07:35:50,360
Thor, why?

7805
07:35:50,800 --> 07:35:51,200
Thor!

7806
07:35:51,200 --> 07:35:51,360
Thor!

7807
07:35:57,620 --> 07:35:59,760
My god, Julesn!

7808
07:36:02,320 --> 07:36:05,180
Oh my god, I guess I've ulted.

7809
07:36:08,280 --> 07:36:11,320
You guys gotta liiiiiiiiiiiiiiii-

7810
07:36:18,450 --> 07:36:19,990
No it's not.

7811
07:36:20,170 --> 07:36:21,570
No it's not spider time.

7812
07:36:21,990 --> 07:36:22,990
No it's not.

7813
07:36:24,450 --> 07:36:25,610
No it's not.

7814
07:36:25,750 --> 07:36:27,010
It's not spider time.

7815
07:36:27,630 --> 07:36:28,950
Nope, spider time's over.

7816
07:36:31,610 --> 07:36:33,490
Oh, that's what I'm saying.

7817
07:36:33,570 --> 07:36:35,330
I feel like I'm not performing badly.

7818
07:36:35,770 --> 07:36:39,490
It's just somehow I'm like very unlucky with teams.

7819
07:36:43,770 --> 07:36:45,170
Oh my god, really?

7820
07:36:50,850 --> 07:36:51,910
Stop, please.

7821
07:36:53,450 --> 07:36:55,130
Oh no, this is bad for us.

7822
07:36:55,690 --> 07:36:56,870
This is so bad.

7823
07:36:57,450 --> 07:36:58,330
Oh my god.

7824
07:36:58,410 --> 07:36:59,090
I couldn't do anything.

7825
07:36:59,290 --> 07:37:01,610
I was already like stuck there.

7826
07:37:01,690 --> 07:37:03,630
Oh no, you got two!

7827
07:37:05,750 --> 07:37:06,730
How close was I?

7828
07:37:06,830 --> 07:37:07,810
I was not close at all.

7829
07:37:08,510 --> 07:37:10,130
I think that's gg there.

7830
07:37:17,080 --> 07:37:20,400
The moment she did the ult, I knew it was over.

7831
07:37:21,280 --> 07:37:22,940
I knew it was over.

7832
07:37:23,060 --> 07:37:26,240
Okay, I'm fucking- I need to get this team out of my fucking game.

7833
07:37:29,580 --> 07:37:33,820
Bro, how am I- oh my god, and I'm always like top healer.

7834
07:37:34,100 --> 07:37:36,060
I was at the most healers out of both teams.

7835
07:37:36,760 --> 07:37:37,580
Oh god.

7836
07:37:37,780 --> 07:37:38,920
Oh god.

7837
07:37:48,890 --> 07:37:52,670
I need to get up and walk a little bit.

7838
07:37:52,810 --> 07:37:54,610
Oh, this is cute.

7839
07:37:55,310 --> 07:38:00,010
I need a 50 Overwatch thing!

7840
07:38:04,390 --> 07:38:05,710
Okay, give me a sec.

7841
07:38:08,190 --> 07:38:12,610
I don't know how I got shitty teams four games in a row.

7842
07:38:13,170 --> 07:38:19,850
I need to get... who's... okay.

7843
07:38:20,890 --> 07:38:22,490
I don't know who was the worst player.

7844
07:38:23,010 --> 07:38:24,250
They were all pretty bad.

7845
07:38:24,970 --> 07:38:26,130
That's the thing.

7846
07:38:26,790 --> 07:38:28,390
All of them were so bad.

7847
07:38:29,090 --> 07:38:30,210
I don't know.

7848
07:38:32,050 --> 07:38:33,330
Oh my god.

7849
07:38:39,820 --> 07:38:40,380
Okay.

7850
07:38:47,370 --> 07:38:47,930
No!

7851
07:38:49,230 --> 07:38:50,370
It's literally...

7852
07:38:50,370 --> 07:38:51,970
The more you play...

7853
07:38:51,970 --> 07:38:52,730
That's the thing.

7854
07:38:53,050 --> 07:38:58,150
The more you play, if you know you're at a certain skill level, you hit it.

7855
07:38:58,690 --> 07:38:59,590
But it's just...

7856
07:38:59,590 --> 07:39:01,970
I'm getting RNG'd so hard with teammates.

7857
07:39:02,670 --> 07:39:03,370
It's actually...

7858
07:39:03,790 --> 07:39:08,810
Most of the people climbing in this ELO or hitting top 500, they stack.

7859
07:39:08,810 --> 07:39:17,110
So when you solo, you have to pray RNG gods that you get the stackers.

7860
07:39:19,390 --> 07:39:20,430
I can't.

7861
07:39:20,530 --> 07:39:21,790
My DPS is not that level.

7862
07:39:22,210 --> 07:39:25,130
All the DPS players are actual top 500 DPS players.

7863
07:39:25,670 --> 07:39:27,850
So I'm not that level in DPS.

7864
07:39:29,950 --> 07:39:30,410
Yeah.

7865
07:39:31,970 --> 07:39:32,470
I did.

7866
07:39:32,810 --> 07:39:34,670
That's why I duo'd with Surefour earlier.

7867
07:39:34,890 --> 07:39:41,310
Because I knew that a lot of people in this ELO, they stack to get higher.

7868
07:39:42,010 --> 07:39:46,120
And now it's so hard because I'm getting RNG'd so fucking much.

7869
07:39:49,730 --> 07:39:53,150
I'm actually getting fucking teammate RNG'd so badly.

7870
07:39:54,070 --> 07:39:55,110
It's actually crazy.

7871
07:39:55,350 --> 07:39:57,130
Like how is it the chance...

7872
07:39:57,130 --> 07:39:57,450
Like...

7873
07:39:57,450 --> 07:39:58,310
Fuck.

7874
07:40:04,310 --> 07:40:05,710
I got it.

7875
07:40:05,890 --> 07:40:08,750
When I have like decent teammates, I can pull it through.

7876
07:40:11,430 --> 07:40:12,950
Have I tried finding a duo?

7877
07:40:13,130 --> 07:40:15,770
I only know two people and two of them said no.

7878
07:40:16,410 --> 07:40:17,550
In my ELO.

7879
07:40:17,810 --> 07:40:22,350
I only know two people in my ELO and two of them said no.

7880
07:40:22,350 --> 07:40:23,590
Because...

7881
07:40:30,060 --> 07:40:31,980
Oh my god.

7882
07:40:33,920 --> 07:40:35,140
She was bad.

7883
07:40:35,260 --> 07:40:35,760
I know.

7884
07:40:37,120 --> 07:40:38,860
I think SK... I don't know.

7885
07:40:40,540 --> 07:40:42,200
I think SK is like...

7886
07:40:43,420 --> 07:40:44,580
She's like...

7887
07:40:44,580 --> 07:40:46,420
I think she's offline too.

7888
07:40:47,200 --> 07:40:49,260
I've never played with SK before.

7889
07:40:52,660 --> 07:40:53,780
I don't know.

7890
07:40:53,880 --> 07:40:54,740
I've never played...

7891
07:40:54,740 --> 07:40:56,620
I feel weird asking people like...

7892
07:40:56,620 --> 07:40:59,500
I've never done like solo stuff before.

7893
07:41:00,580 --> 07:41:02,180
I feel weird asking.

7894
07:41:09,760 --> 07:41:11,420
I feel weird asking.

7895
07:41:11,760 --> 07:41:13,540
And I don't think she's in my range.

7896
07:41:13,660 --> 07:41:14,580
I think she's too high.

7897
07:41:15,060 --> 07:41:16,400
I know she's diamond something.

7898
07:41:17,260 --> 07:41:18,620
She's like diamond now.

7899
07:41:19,120 --> 07:41:20,900
I don't know if I can queue with diamond players.

7900
07:41:21,860 --> 07:41:23,360
Can I queue with diamond players?

7901
07:41:29,480 --> 07:41:30,680
I mean I can...

7902
07:41:30,680 --> 07:41:31,360
Oh my god.

7903
07:41:31,400 --> 07:41:32,200
I feel so weird.

7904
07:41:32,420 --> 07:41:34,180
I feel so weird messaging SK.

7905
07:41:36,480 --> 07:41:36,960
Okay.

7906
07:41:37,380 --> 07:41:37,660
Alright.

7907
07:41:38,140 --> 07:41:40,740
If we lose this one, we message SK.

7908
07:41:41,400 --> 07:41:43,340
But if it's not my fault, chat.

7909
07:41:43,440 --> 07:41:48,760
If it's not my fault and we lost, I'll message SK and see if she'll be down.

7910
07:41:51,780 --> 07:41:54,160
No, I was sure for when to bidge.

7911
07:41:56,200 --> 07:41:57,580
I hate playing on this side.

7912
07:41:58,000 --> 07:42:00,560
I've never been very lucky on this side of the map.

7913
07:42:04,240 --> 07:42:06,280
That was not a good choice for my end.

7914
07:42:06,520 --> 07:42:06,960
What?

7915
07:42:09,360 --> 07:42:09,800
What?

7916
07:42:10,960 --> 07:42:12,280
How are you dead?

7917
07:42:16,780 --> 07:42:17,860
Wait, how are you alive?

7918
07:42:19,160 --> 07:42:20,340
Wait, how do we have one tank?

7919
07:42:20,480 --> 07:42:21,560
I have so many questions.

7920
07:42:25,560 --> 07:42:26,000
Okay.

7921
07:42:27,020 --> 07:42:28,580
I don't like that we're here.

7922
07:42:28,820 --> 07:42:30,240
Please, I need help.

7923
07:42:30,500 --> 07:42:30,780
Okay.

7924
07:42:38,330 --> 07:42:39,390
Okay, we got one.

7925
07:42:46,440 --> 07:42:47,400
Focusing up.

7926
07:42:50,460 --> 07:42:51,020
Okay, nice.

7927
07:42:52,360 --> 07:42:53,680
We got the control back.

7928
07:42:55,300 --> 07:42:57,380
I don't like being on this side though, that's the thing.

7929
07:42:58,820 --> 07:43:00,300
It's such a weird comp.

7930
07:43:08,220 --> 07:43:09,980
Like, we're so...

7931
07:43:11,660 --> 07:43:12,700
We're so...

7932
07:43:13,260 --> 07:43:14,540
We're so split.

7933
07:43:16,260 --> 07:43:17,600
I don't really like that.

7934
07:43:23,580 --> 07:43:24,500
Holy shit.

7935
07:43:24,740 --> 07:43:25,240
Oh, that's two.

7936
07:43:25,320 --> 07:43:25,860
That's two kills.

7937
07:43:25,960 --> 07:43:26,440
We should go in.

7938
07:43:27,500 --> 07:43:28,320
Okay, nevermind.

7939
07:43:28,440 --> 07:43:29,060
One of us is back.

7940
07:43:33,970 --> 07:43:34,850
You know what?

7941
07:43:35,130 --> 07:43:36,070
Fuck it.

7942
07:43:39,990 --> 07:43:40,750
Standing this.

7943
07:43:40,830 --> 07:43:41,410
Standing this!

7944
07:43:41,410 --> 07:43:42,830
Standing this!

7945
07:43:43,630 --> 07:43:45,850
Both teams are actually...

7946
07:43:45,850 --> 07:43:47,030
I'm gonna say it.

7947
07:43:47,410 --> 07:43:49,330
I think both teams are equally bad.

7948
07:43:52,790 --> 07:43:54,430
I'm gonna say it.

7949
07:43:54,950 --> 07:43:56,570
I legitimately don't think...

7950
07:43:56,570 --> 07:43:58,310
I think both teams are not great.

7951
07:43:58,710 --> 07:44:01,910
My team and the enemy team are, like, really special.

7952
07:44:10,290 --> 07:44:11,810
Why do I say that?

7953
07:44:11,910 --> 07:44:13,970
I can tell from the way people play.

7954
07:44:13,970 --> 07:44:16,310
Like, this is...

7955
07:44:16,310 --> 07:44:18,370
not, like...

7956
07:44:19,370 --> 07:44:20,010
high...

7957
07:44:20,010 --> 07:44:20,930
elo.

7958
07:44:21,170 --> 07:44:24,470
It is high elo, but you know what I mean?

7959
07:44:24,810 --> 07:44:25,750
This is...

7960
07:44:25,750 --> 07:44:27,210
This is stupid.

7961
07:44:27,530 --> 07:44:29,790
Compared to the games I played earlier.

7962
07:44:35,520 --> 07:44:38,280
This feels very stupid to watch.

7963
07:44:41,830 --> 07:44:43,290
We'll keep each other up.

7964
07:44:50,830 --> 07:44:51,310
Okay.

7965
07:44:52,810 --> 07:44:54,520
No, I'm just saying...

7966
07:44:56,770 --> 07:44:58,290
Both of...

7967
07:44:58,290 --> 07:45:00,810
Both teams play very stupid.

7968
07:45:02,030 --> 07:45:06,210
And, like, you can sort of tell...

7969
07:45:06,210 --> 07:45:08,520
You can sort of tell...

7970
07:45:09,250 --> 07:45:12,390
that both teams play...

7971
07:45:12,390 --> 07:45:13,670
very stupid.

7972
07:45:25,350 --> 07:45:26,030
Yeah.

7973
07:45:26,250 --> 07:45:28,730
Yeah, this is like a fucking clown.

7974
07:45:29,190 --> 07:45:29,930
This is a circus.

7975
07:45:30,590 --> 07:45:33,350
This is legitimately a fucking circus.

7976
07:45:42,550 --> 07:45:45,230
Oh my god, this is a fucking circus.

7977
07:45:45,450 --> 07:45:46,790
I'm messaging SK.

7978
07:45:51,470 --> 07:45:52,590
I can't.

7979
07:45:52,950 --> 07:45:54,430
This is a fucking circus.

7980
07:45:54,690 --> 07:45:58,810
I saw the quality of the games there, and I'm like, bro...

7981
07:45:58,810 --> 07:46:01,250
Take me back to high elo.

7982
07:46:01,570 --> 07:46:02,550
Oh, is she asleep?

7983
07:46:02,970 --> 07:46:03,530
Aww.

7984
07:46:03,710 --> 07:46:04,250
Alright.

7985
07:46:05,850 --> 07:46:06,530
I mean...

7986
07:46:06,530 --> 07:46:07,070
I'll mess...

7987
07:46:07,070 --> 07:46:07,810
Is she asleep?

7988
07:46:11,570 --> 07:46:12,530
Okay, um...

7989
07:46:12,530 --> 07:46:13,830
Who was doing the best?

7990
07:46:13,910 --> 07:46:15,530
I guess it was our Hella.

7991
07:46:16,210 --> 07:46:17,770
So I'll put this on the Hella.

7992
07:46:18,630 --> 07:46:20,510
Alright, then I lost all my choices.

7993
07:46:21,390 --> 07:46:23,850
I know, like, Booger really wanted to duo.

7994
07:46:24,450 --> 07:46:27,850
Because he fucking was, like, duo on Twitter, and he never even followed me.

7995
07:46:27,950 --> 07:46:28,630
I was like, the fuck?

7996
07:46:28,890 --> 07:46:29,370
Where...

7997
07:46:29,370 --> 07:46:29,970
Where are you?

7998
07:46:31,150 --> 07:46:33,370
I think he's way too high elo.

7999
07:46:36,550 --> 07:46:38,610
So this is the future.

8000
07:46:39,010 --> 07:46:40,850
Or one future, anyway.

8001
07:46:48,240 --> 07:46:50,360
They want to get better, though.

8002
07:46:52,240 --> 07:46:53,350
Jesus Christ.

8003
07:46:53,960 --> 07:46:56,220
What the fuck was that?

8004
07:47:02,180 --> 07:47:04,940
Actually, what the fuck was that all?

8005
07:47:12,730 --> 07:47:13,250
Oh!

8006
07:47:13,350 --> 07:47:13,670
Oh my god!

8007
07:47:13,710 --> 07:47:15,150
You're not dying on me, soldier!

8008
07:47:15,730 --> 07:47:17,830
You're not fucking dying on me!

8009
07:47:17,930 --> 07:47:18,470
You fight!

8010
07:47:19,210 --> 07:47:20,350
You fucking fight!

8011
07:47:21,830 --> 07:47:22,650
That's right!

8012
07:47:24,010 --> 07:47:25,610
And then I leave you guys.

8013
07:47:25,710 --> 07:47:26,550
If you die, it's...

8014
07:47:26,550 --> 07:47:27,170
I'm sorry.

8015
07:47:30,550 --> 07:47:31,470
Okay, wow.

8016
07:47:31,630 --> 07:47:33,070
I didn't expect you guys to actually fight.

8017
07:47:36,350 --> 07:47:36,910
Alright.

8018
07:47:37,530 --> 07:47:38,450
Are they okay?

8019
07:47:39,070 --> 07:47:41,170
Holy shit, they were not okay!

8020
07:47:46,530 --> 07:47:47,090
Nice.

8021
07:47:50,320 --> 07:47:51,800
This is a fucking circus.

8022
07:47:52,320 --> 07:47:53,680
Winning this game is not...

8023
07:47:53,680 --> 07:47:56,180
I mean, it makes me happy, because I finally break my last streak.

8024
07:47:56,640 --> 07:47:58,120
But, like...

8025
07:47:58,120 --> 07:48:01,120
This quality of this game was...

8026
07:48:02,520 --> 07:48:03,080
Okay.

8027
07:48:11,930 --> 07:48:13,050
Alright, goodbye.

8028
07:48:16,510 --> 07:48:19,090
Oh shit, she's gonna put on a show and send out the spiders.

8029
07:48:19,710 --> 07:48:20,410
Oh my god.

8030
07:48:21,850 --> 07:48:22,530
That's fucking crazy.

8031
07:48:24,510 --> 07:48:25,090
Oh shit!

8032
07:48:26,170 --> 07:48:27,070
That's right, do it your way!

8033
07:48:27,470 --> 07:48:28,110
Do it your way!

8034
07:48:28,430 --> 07:48:29,150
That's fucking right!

8035
07:48:30,450 --> 07:48:31,410
Oh, he's dead.

8036
07:48:32,010 --> 07:48:33,190
Oh my god.

8037
07:48:33,530 --> 07:48:34,430
He is...

8038
07:48:34,430 --> 07:48:36,110
He should not have done it his way.

8039
07:48:39,630 --> 07:48:40,150
Oh...

8040
07:48:41,030 --> 07:48:42,650
Guys, I froze the spider thing.

8041
07:48:42,910 --> 07:48:43,550
I did it.

8042
07:48:45,290 --> 07:48:46,570
You'll never expect it.

8043
07:48:47,010 --> 07:48:47,910
It's been frozen.

8044
07:48:49,310 --> 07:48:51,110
Oh shit, I didn't realize there was a Hella.

8045
07:48:56,510 --> 07:48:57,870
Thank god I'm still alive.

8046
07:49:01,690 --> 07:49:02,830
Oh my god.

8047
07:49:03,950 --> 07:49:04,470
Guys.

8048
07:49:05,010 --> 07:49:07,910
I finally got the RNG of the teammates, guys.

8049
07:49:10,490 --> 07:49:12,170
Guys, I finally did it.

8050
07:49:12,170 --> 07:49:15,210
I got the teammate RNG.

8051
07:49:15,890 --> 07:49:17,430
Oh my god.

8052
07:49:17,850 --> 07:49:20,970
It happened.

8053
07:49:21,650 --> 07:49:22,370
It happened.

8054
07:49:22,970 --> 07:49:24,330
I got the teammate RNG.

8055
07:49:27,950 --> 07:49:29,370
Oh my god.

8056
07:49:29,810 --> 07:49:31,750
I actually did it.

8057
07:49:32,710 --> 07:49:33,530
Oh my god.

8058
07:49:34,770 --> 07:49:36,470
I got the teammate RNG.

8059
07:49:37,890 --> 07:49:38,810
Oh my god.

8060
07:49:38,810 --> 07:49:40,270
I did it.

8061
07:49:42,550 --> 07:49:45,110
I gotta take what I can get.

8062
07:49:45,750 --> 07:49:48,730
I gotta take what I can fucking get.

8063
07:49:51,490 --> 07:49:53,450
I'm desperate here.

8064
07:49:53,970 --> 07:49:55,450
I'm fucking desperate.

8065
07:49:56,270 --> 07:49:58,610
I didn't expect this to be such a long stream.

8066
07:50:18,640 --> 07:50:19,780
Okay.

8067
07:50:23,560 --> 07:50:26,200
Come on, RNG.

8068
07:50:27,060 --> 07:50:29,100
Come on, RNG.

8069
07:50:30,340 --> 07:50:32,780
We just...

8070
07:50:32,780 --> 07:50:35,040
Oh my god, we just...

8071
07:50:50,400 --> 07:50:52,140
Okay, Eski said she's down.

8072
07:50:52,260 --> 07:50:52,640
Alright.

8073
07:50:53,740 --> 07:50:54,160
Alright.

8074
07:51:04,820 --> 07:51:06,560
Oh my god.

8075
07:51:08,700 --> 07:51:09,300
Okay.

8076
07:51:13,500 --> 07:51:16,280
Alright, I'm gonna use the fucking... I'm gonna use the bathroom.

8077
07:51:16,480 --> 07:51:16,980
Oh my god.

8078
07:51:17,160 --> 07:51:18,300
I get six avoid slots.

8079
07:51:18,760 --> 07:51:20,460
I get six avoid slots.

8080
07:51:20,980 --> 07:51:21,660
Let's go!

8081
07:52:14,590 --> 07:52:16,270
I get six avoid slots.

8082
07:52:16,470 --> 07:52:18,610
Oh my god, let's fucking go.

8083
07:52:18,770 --> 07:52:20,590
That's like the one thing I'm the most happy about.

8084
07:52:21,430 --> 07:52:22,690
I'm so happy.

8085
07:52:23,050 --> 07:52:24,170
I get avoid slots.

8086
07:52:24,630 --> 07:52:32,910
I get avoid slots and I have someone that knows how to play DPS.

8087
07:52:34,250 --> 07:52:34,810
That's...

8088
07:52:34,810 --> 07:52:35,850
Oh my god.

8089
07:52:36,450 --> 07:52:39,430
Using Eski as an extra avoid slot.

8090
07:52:44,150 --> 07:52:45,230
It's the...

8091
07:52:45,230 --> 07:52:46,890
Guys, no, you don't understand.

8092
07:52:47,150 --> 07:52:48,570
That's basically...

8093
07:52:48,570 --> 07:52:50,870
That's basically what Overwatch was like.

8094
07:52:50,970 --> 07:52:54,750
People stacked so they can use avoid slots to get rid of people.

8095
07:52:54,990 --> 07:52:58,470
That's also like another thing a lot...

8096
07:52:59,030 --> 07:53:00,390
Another thing people would do.

8097
07:53:01,030 --> 07:53:01,850
But I can't.

8098
07:53:01,910 --> 07:53:02,470
This is...

8099
07:53:08,730 --> 07:53:10,510
It's what people used to do.

8100
07:53:10,610 --> 07:53:11,450
And I'm fucking...

8101
07:53:11,450 --> 07:53:14,730
I'm using up all my old tricks to climb.

8102
07:53:15,830 --> 07:53:17,970
Using my fucking tricks to climb.

8103
07:53:19,290 --> 07:53:20,330
Jesus Christ.

8104
07:53:20,510 --> 07:53:22,390
Because I don't think...

8105
07:53:22,390 --> 07:53:24,290
I don't think I'm doing that bad.

8106
07:53:24,770 --> 07:53:27,370
I think I have made mistakes here and there.

8107
07:53:27,790 --> 07:53:33,250
But I don't think my mistakes could have given me the last streak that I had.

8108
07:53:34,410 --> 07:53:35,010
These...

8109
07:53:35,010 --> 07:53:37,710
These games were fucking unwinnable.

8110
07:53:37,850 --> 07:53:40,530
All of these games were fucking unwinnable.

8111
07:53:40,530 --> 07:53:43,370
None of them were winnable at all.

8112
07:53:43,510 --> 07:53:46,310
I refuse to believe these games were winnable.

8113
07:53:46,510 --> 07:53:48,190
Like, I...

8114
07:53:48,190 --> 07:53:51,210
I fucking refuse to believe that.

8115
07:53:56,890 --> 07:53:57,530
Oh...

8116
07:53:57,530 --> 07:53:59,790
Yeah, no, because like...

8117
07:53:59,790 --> 07:54:02,070
I felt like I was doing pretty well.

8118
07:54:03,130 --> 07:54:05,310
Or like the situation I was in.

8119
07:54:07,670 --> 07:54:08,310
Like...

8120
07:54:08,310 --> 07:54:09,490
Oh my god.

8121
07:54:15,580 --> 07:54:16,540
Or like...

8122
07:54:16,860 --> 07:54:18,600
Would I have to fucking be pushed through?

8123
07:54:24,840 --> 07:54:27,080
No way it was my fault.

8124
07:54:27,800 --> 07:54:28,440
Like...

8125
07:54:32,000 --> 07:54:34,780
I had so many people feeding.

8126
07:54:35,160 --> 07:54:36,160
Oh yeah, fuck Devon.

8127
07:54:36,240 --> 07:54:36,840
They were right.

8128
07:54:37,380 --> 07:54:37,960
They were right.

8129
07:54:38,060 --> 07:54:40,960
I played my fucking heart out for this one.

8130
07:54:41,600 --> 07:54:41,980
I...

8131
07:54:41,980 --> 07:54:45,280
I kept everybody alive for the longest fucking time.

8132
07:54:45,420 --> 07:54:46,400
Fuck you, Devon.

8133
07:54:47,120 --> 07:54:48,780
The enemy team was right.

8134
07:54:49,100 --> 07:54:51,260
You were a fucking prime avoid slot.

8135
07:54:51,440 --> 07:54:52,400
I didn't listen.

8136
07:54:54,200 --> 07:54:55,820
I didn't fucking listen.

8137
07:54:56,000 --> 07:54:57,580
They were like, you should avoid him.

8138
07:54:57,660 --> 07:54:58,300
And I was like, really?

8139
07:54:58,540 --> 07:54:59,800
And then I didn't listen.

8140
07:55:00,380 --> 07:55:01,260
Fuck you, Devon.

8141
07:55:01,620 --> 07:55:03,140
You did not lock in.

8142
07:55:03,880 --> 07:55:06,380
You did not fucking lock in when I needed you to.

8143
07:55:08,940 --> 07:55:11,540
We hate Devon1 in chat.

8144
07:55:12,700 --> 07:55:13,560
That's right.

8145
07:55:13,560 --> 07:55:13,880
Shit.

8146
07:55:14,280 --> 07:55:15,420
We hate you.

8147
07:55:17,720 --> 07:55:18,700
Oh shit.

8148
07:55:19,120 --> 07:55:20,180
I got a friend request sent.

8149
07:55:21,160 --> 07:55:22,360
Oh my god, they actually added me.

8150
07:55:22,440 --> 07:55:23,120
I'm so...

8151
07:55:23,120 --> 07:55:23,900
No, get out.

8152
07:55:25,900 --> 07:55:26,960
Get out.

8153
07:55:27,440 --> 07:55:28,380
Get fucking...

8154
07:55:28,380 --> 07:55:29,620
I actually...

8155
07:55:32,900 --> 07:55:34,100
Oh my god.

8156
07:55:34,660 --> 07:55:35,460
Oh my god.

8157
07:55:37,420 --> 07:55:38,780
Oh my god.

8158
07:55:39,240 --> 07:55:40,180
Oh shit.

8159
07:55:40,920 --> 07:55:42,780
Save me from...

8160
07:55:42,780 --> 07:55:44,620
From the circus.

8161
07:55:52,540 --> 07:55:54,660
Oh my god.

8162
07:55:55,400 --> 07:55:56,580
Rest in peace.

8163
07:55:58,560 --> 07:55:59,880
There's no way, Devon.

8164
07:56:00,040 --> 07:56:00,760
Devon1.

8165
07:56:01,700 --> 07:56:04,000
You can't be in chat, Devon1.

8166
07:56:04,480 --> 07:56:05,400
Oh my god.

8167
07:56:31,820 --> 07:56:33,400
And just got off 30 minutes.

8168
07:56:33,560 --> 07:56:36,500
Welcome back to the grind.

8169
07:56:39,440 --> 07:56:40,560
Wait, what's...

8170
07:56:40,560 --> 07:56:41,500
Oh, Plat 1?

8171
07:56:42,420 --> 07:56:42,720
Wait.

8172
07:56:43,860 --> 07:56:45,260
Wait, you're not Diamond?

8173
07:56:48,200 --> 07:56:52,360
I thought you were Diamond 3.

8174
07:56:54,720 --> 07:56:55,840
I thought...

8175
07:57:01,380 --> 07:57:02,160
Wait, I thought...

8176
07:57:02,160 --> 07:57:03,080
I thought...

8177
07:57:03,080 --> 07:57:04,000
I hit Plat 1.

8178
07:57:04,000 --> 07:57:05,000
Oh!

8179
07:57:07,800 --> 07:57:08,720
I thought...

8180
07:57:08,720 --> 07:57:10,020
She was high...

8181
07:57:10,020 --> 07:57:11,020
She was on the leaderboards.

8182
07:57:11,820 --> 07:57:13,040
So I thought she was Diamond.

8183
07:57:20,540 --> 07:57:21,480
That's why.

8184
07:57:21,560 --> 07:57:21,860
Okay.

8185
07:57:22,760 --> 07:57:23,560
I was confused.

8186
07:57:23,840 --> 07:57:24,440
Because I was like...

8187
07:57:24,440 --> 07:57:25,060
Wait, I thought...

8188
07:57:25,060 --> 07:57:29,560
She had on her stream title her ELO and stuff.

8189
07:57:31,180 --> 07:57:31,760
And...

8190
07:57:33,700 --> 07:57:34,280
Alright.

8191
07:57:34,920 --> 07:57:35,640
That's right.

8192
07:57:35,940 --> 07:57:36,460
Get out.

8193
07:57:36,640 --> 07:57:37,700
I'm not even going to swap.

8194
07:57:43,420 --> 07:57:45,240
That's right, Ashlyn.

8195
07:57:45,460 --> 07:57:47,080
That's fucking right.

8196
07:58:02,360 --> 07:58:03,120
Oh.

8197
07:58:03,440 --> 07:58:04,200
Nah.

8198
07:58:05,600 --> 07:58:06,240
Nah.

8199
07:58:06,520 --> 07:58:12,040
I'm trying not to use my voice too much anymore.

8200
07:58:15,340 --> 07:58:17,960
Do we have two support players?

8201
07:58:18,960 --> 07:58:20,980
Bro, do we have three support players?

8202
07:58:21,100 --> 07:58:22,500
Are you fucking serious?

8203
07:58:24,560 --> 07:58:25,940
Oh my god.

8204
07:58:27,160 --> 07:58:29,360
Do we have three support players?

8205
07:58:29,540 --> 07:58:30,900
Are you fucking serious?

8206
07:58:32,840 --> 07:58:35,100
Bro, I don't even know who the fuck is talking anymore.

8207
07:58:35,540 --> 07:58:38,020
I don't know who the fuck is talking.

8208
07:58:39,100 --> 07:58:39,240
Oh.

8209
07:58:40,460 --> 07:58:41,120
It's me.

8210
07:58:41,820 --> 07:58:42,160
Good comp.

8211
07:58:45,860 --> 07:58:46,440
Alright.

8212
07:58:47,380 --> 07:58:47,700
Wait.

8213
07:58:52,620 --> 07:58:54,680
What the fuck was talking?

8214
07:58:55,040 --> 07:58:56,540
I can't tell who's talking.

8215
07:59:02,420 --> 07:59:03,060
Okay.

8216
07:59:05,220 --> 07:59:06,380
Is that SK?

8217
07:59:06,520 --> 07:59:07,260
I can't tell.

8218
07:59:07,600 --> 07:59:08,240
The...

8219
07:59:08,240 --> 07:59:08,900
The...

8220
07:59:08,900 --> 07:59:10,680
Like, I can't tell if it's her.

8221
07:59:16,520 --> 07:59:17,400
She's one.

8222
07:59:17,700 --> 07:59:18,920
She's literally...

8223
07:59:18,920 --> 07:59:19,540
No way.

8224
07:59:19,860 --> 07:59:20,320
Here we go.

8225
07:59:22,840 --> 07:59:24,240
Is that SK talking?

8226
07:59:24,400 --> 07:59:24,680
I can't...

8227
07:59:24,680 --> 07:59:25,660
I hate the VC.

8228
07:59:26,340 --> 07:59:27,600
It's so buggy.

8229
07:59:29,180 --> 07:59:31,920
It's the one thing I hate the most about...

8230
07:59:38,240 --> 07:59:39,980
I'm trying to keep you up.

8231
07:59:40,080 --> 07:59:40,360
Venom!

8232
07:59:40,680 --> 07:59:41,240
Venom!

8233
07:59:41,360 --> 07:59:43,160
Don't climb like that, Venom!

8234
07:59:45,860 --> 07:59:46,820
Venom, please!

8235
07:59:53,600 --> 07:59:54,640
Oh my god.

8236
07:59:59,970 --> 08:00:01,450
Oh my god, we're trying.

8237
08:00:04,590 --> 08:00:05,970
Oh, I'm dead.

8238
08:00:10,270 --> 08:00:11,050
Oh shit.

8239
08:00:14,210 --> 08:00:14,730
Alright.

8240
08:00:19,050 --> 08:00:19,570
Okay.

8241
08:00:24,130 --> 08:00:24,650
Alright.

8242
08:00:24,970 --> 08:00:25,970
It's fine, I have ult.

8243
08:00:30,730 --> 08:00:32,370
It's fine, I have ult, guys.

8244
08:00:32,370 --> 08:00:33,670
That is not fine.

8245
08:00:33,710 --> 08:00:35,630
Holy shit, that is not...

8246
08:00:36,270 --> 08:00:37,490
Alright, there we go, guys.

8247
08:00:38,130 --> 08:00:38,870
Dance time.

8248
08:00:39,110 --> 08:00:40,430
Oh my god!

8249
08:00:40,710 --> 08:00:42,090
What a combo!

8250
08:00:43,250 --> 08:00:43,930
Okay.

8251
08:00:45,710 --> 08:00:48,070
I thought that was a cool ult.

8252
08:00:50,270 --> 08:00:52,130
They deserve that.

8253
08:00:52,310 --> 08:00:53,370
They honestly...

8254
08:00:53,890 --> 08:00:56,290
They deserve that win right there.

8255
08:01:02,370 --> 08:01:03,950
I don't care.

8256
08:01:05,990 --> 08:01:08,350
What the fuck is going on?

8257
08:01:09,090 --> 08:01:11,290
What is going on?

8258
08:01:14,410 --> 08:01:17,310
What the fuck is going on?

8259
08:01:18,150 --> 08:01:19,870
Okay, I need heals too.

8260
08:01:21,270 --> 08:01:26,010
Why are people yelling?

8261
08:01:27,770 --> 08:01:29,150
I'm making a comeback.

8262
08:01:29,850 --> 08:01:33,290
I know, but who was the other teammate saying?

8263
08:01:34,150 --> 08:01:35,990
Guys, I thought we would do...

8264
08:01:35,990 --> 08:01:37,590
I'd get less of a circus.

8265
08:01:38,070 --> 08:01:39,790
Just go support, you can play through support.

8266
08:01:39,970 --> 08:01:40,250
It's good.

8267
08:01:43,250 --> 08:01:44,470
You won't die though.

8268
08:01:45,310 --> 08:01:46,590
Only 60 seconds left.

8269
08:01:46,970 --> 08:01:47,370
It's fine.

8270
08:01:51,950 --> 08:01:53,130
Sorry team, we got this.

8271
08:01:53,350 --> 08:01:53,610
We're doing great.

8272
08:01:53,610 --> 08:01:55,330
I am ready to put on a show!

8273
08:01:56,010 --> 08:01:56,870
What the fuck?

8274
08:01:57,650 --> 08:01:58,570
I think we got him.

8275
08:02:00,270 --> 08:02:01,170
He's one.

8276
08:02:01,310 --> 08:02:02,490
He's actually one.

8277
08:02:02,590 --> 08:02:02,890
Please!

8278
08:02:04,050 --> 08:02:04,890
I'm the only...

8279
08:02:04,890 --> 08:02:07,010
Oh, we did get three support players.

8280
08:02:07,230 --> 08:02:09,030
How do I have this problem?

8281
08:02:09,990 --> 08:02:10,990
Every time!

8282
08:02:12,690 --> 08:02:13,690
I actually...

8283
08:02:13,690 --> 08:02:15,990
I had three support players.

8284
08:02:16,210 --> 08:02:16,830
I'm trying to do a TP.

8285
08:02:17,150 --> 08:02:18,230
Let's all regroup.

8286
08:02:19,210 --> 08:02:20,230
Come on, I'm playing.

8287
08:02:20,530 --> 08:02:21,830
We don't have a game to play.

8288
08:02:23,690 --> 08:02:24,750
Go outside and help us.

8289
08:02:26,170 --> 08:02:27,210
Where are you going to help us?

8290
08:02:29,270 --> 08:02:30,570
I don't understand.

8291
08:02:35,660 --> 08:02:36,660
Oh, hello.

8292
08:02:37,560 --> 08:02:40,100
Hey, can we like go through the TP and help our guy?

8293
08:02:40,680 --> 08:02:42,180
I think he needs help, guys.

8294
08:02:45,460 --> 08:02:46,260
Oh no.

8295
08:02:47,700 --> 08:02:49,740
Oh no, his powers are his.

8296
08:02:51,840 --> 08:02:53,720
Bro, I'm fucking scared right now.

8297
08:02:56,000 --> 08:02:57,020
Oh my god.

8298
08:02:57,140 --> 08:02:58,220
Well, here we go.

8299
08:02:58,920 --> 08:03:01,540
I'm ready to put on the show now.

8300
08:03:02,900 --> 08:03:04,840
Oh no, there it is.

8301
08:03:05,100 --> 08:03:05,640
Okay.

8302
08:03:06,780 --> 08:03:07,280
Alright.

8303
08:03:07,860 --> 08:03:09,040
Off I go.

8304
08:03:09,980 --> 08:03:13,720
Hoping things go better, but I don't think so.

8305
08:03:17,000 --> 08:03:17,540
Okay.

8306
08:03:18,100 --> 08:03:19,660
They need a one instead of three.

8307
08:03:22,260 --> 08:03:23,340
Good try.

8308
08:03:24,760 --> 08:03:25,740
Oh.

8309
08:03:26,980 --> 08:03:28,700
I'm dancing my pain away.

8310
08:03:32,440 --> 08:03:34,620
I'm so locked in.

8311
08:03:35,720 --> 08:03:38,180
Where the fuck is our Venom?

8312
08:03:41,370 --> 08:03:43,080
Welcome to my circus.

8313
08:03:43,760 --> 08:03:49,940
I've just been getting three plus supports on my team.

8314
08:03:53,800 --> 08:03:56,040
What is...

8315
08:04:00,700 --> 08:04:01,260
Why...

8316
08:04:01,820 --> 08:04:03,380
But all my...

8317
08:04:03,380 --> 08:04:07,120
But all of these have been my lobbies.

8318
08:04:08,260 --> 08:04:12,320
The last six games.

8319
08:04:13,480 --> 08:04:14,520
I don't understand.

8320
08:04:17,140 --> 08:04:18,260
Why...

8321
08:04:18,260 --> 08:04:19,740
Why do I get...

8322
08:04:19,740 --> 08:04:22,180
SK Leary is like, I've never had these lobbies before.

8323
08:04:23,440 --> 08:04:25,840
This is my personal circle of hell.

8324
08:04:26,500 --> 08:04:28,000
This is my...

8325
08:04:28,000 --> 08:04:30,740
This is actually my personal circle of hell.

8326
08:04:33,620 --> 08:04:34,060
Hey.

8327
08:04:34,620 --> 08:04:35,540
Now you can hear me.

8328
08:04:35,720 --> 08:04:36,440
Is my mic working?

8329
08:04:37,400 --> 08:04:37,840
Yes.

8330
08:04:38,420 --> 08:04:39,840
It doesn't show up on the top left.

8331
08:04:40,080 --> 08:04:40,480
That's so weird.

8332
08:04:41,340 --> 08:04:42,180
It's a bug.

8333
08:04:42,420 --> 08:04:44,700
You need to wait like two seconds for the mic to work.

8334
08:04:45,960 --> 08:04:46,840
Did I just say it didn't work?

8335
08:04:47,480 --> 08:04:48,700
Wait, is it cutting me off then?

8336
08:04:49,400 --> 08:04:50,040
No, no, no.

8337
08:04:50,180 --> 08:04:50,660
Where are you?

8338
08:04:50,720 --> 08:04:51,700
You just don't see me.

8339
08:04:51,840 --> 08:04:52,360
I don't know.

8340
08:04:52,380 --> 08:04:53,620
I like playing ranks.

8341
08:04:53,840 --> 08:04:56,060
Just not voice chatting.

8342
08:04:56,640 --> 08:04:57,900
Unless I'm like locked in.

8343
08:04:57,960 --> 08:05:02,360
Because if I voice chat with people in rank, it's just me literally just comming.

8344
08:05:03,940 --> 08:05:04,580
Like I don't need...

8345
08:05:04,580 --> 08:05:05,520
It's not like entertainment.

8346
08:05:05,720 --> 08:05:07,760
Like I don't like play to entertain.

8347
08:05:08,000 --> 08:05:10,100
I literally play to...

8348
08:05:11,600 --> 08:05:13,040
Play to lock in.

8349
08:05:13,220 --> 08:05:13,480
Literally.

8350
08:05:13,480 --> 08:05:13,980
Wait, wait, wait.

8351
08:05:29,300 --> 08:05:30,540
Alright, I got...

8352
08:05:35,080 --> 08:05:35,960
Complat 2.

8353
08:05:36,080 --> 08:05:36,540
I do rank.

8354
08:05:37,220 --> 08:05:39,080
I was in my personal health.

8355
08:05:41,680 --> 08:05:42,240
He's low.

8356
08:05:45,820 --> 08:05:47,000
Oh my god.

8357
08:05:52,260 --> 08:05:52,920
Okay, nice.

8358
08:05:58,210 --> 08:05:59,590
Oh, I missed it!

8359
08:06:00,850 --> 08:06:01,790
I win one.

8360
08:06:02,790 --> 08:06:03,430
Okay.

8361
08:06:05,870 --> 08:06:07,490
How could this be SK's worst lobby?

8362
08:06:08,050 --> 08:06:11,110
Like literally my game is her worst lobby.

8363
08:06:11,310 --> 08:06:13,590
Like that's actually crazy when you think about it.

8364
08:06:14,230 --> 08:06:16,710
I've been playing these lobbies this entire time.

8365
08:06:19,190 --> 08:06:24,190
Like it's so crazy to think about because these have only been my lobbies.

8366
08:06:24,830 --> 08:06:25,870
So I don't know how...

8367
08:06:29,910 --> 08:06:31,250
Oh, this is really bad.

8368
08:06:31,250 --> 08:06:31,290
Oh.

8369
08:06:36,160 --> 08:06:37,040
Oh no.

8370
08:06:39,040 --> 08:06:39,680
No.

8371
08:06:40,160 --> 08:06:41,220
Okay, I got it.

8372
08:06:42,040 --> 08:06:43,000
I got it.

8373
08:06:43,060 --> 08:06:44,240
I literally just got it.

8374
08:06:44,460 --> 08:06:45,240
Oh my god.

8375
08:06:46,060 --> 08:06:48,140
I literally just got it.

8376
08:06:50,200 --> 08:06:51,480
That was so scary.

8377
08:06:53,240 --> 08:06:53,720
Nice one.

8378
08:06:55,760 --> 08:06:57,020
Guess I die.

8379
08:07:05,690 --> 08:07:07,550
She's dead.

8380
08:07:09,590 --> 08:07:11,370
I hope you win with that.

8381
08:07:12,150 --> 08:07:13,270
Okay.

8382
08:07:14,770 --> 08:07:18,710
Okay, you gotta avoid one of the supports.

8383
08:07:20,570 --> 08:07:23,170
This is my avoid list.

8384
08:07:23,970 --> 08:07:26,690
It's all Luna one-tricks.

8385
08:07:27,210 --> 08:07:31,010
Because I'm a Luna one-trick.

8386
08:07:37,590 --> 08:07:40,370
I don't understand how no one...

8387
08:07:40,370 --> 08:07:40,630
Okay.

8388
08:07:41,570 --> 08:07:43,350
The thing is, chat.

8389
08:07:43,570 --> 08:07:45,250
I was talking to one of my friends.

8390
08:07:45,670 --> 08:07:46,890
Because they would come and play with me.

8391
08:07:47,970 --> 08:07:50,270
When I was, you know, I'm going crazy.

8392
08:07:50,730 --> 08:07:53,270
And then I was like...

8393
08:07:53,270 --> 08:07:54,910
They were like, how are you having this problem?

8394
08:07:55,150 --> 08:07:57,070
I'm always forced to fill as support.

8395
08:07:57,930 --> 08:08:00,190
I was like, I wish I have your issue.

8396
08:08:00,890 --> 08:08:01,650
Like I...

8397
08:08:01,650 --> 08:08:04,730
I wish I have your problem.

8398
08:08:04,730 --> 08:08:07,090
Because they're like, that's crazy.

8399
08:08:07,450 --> 08:08:10,310
I've never had a case where there's too many support players.

8400
08:08:10,430 --> 08:08:11,910
And I'm like, how?

8401
08:08:12,410 --> 08:08:13,570
How the fuck?

8402
08:08:20,920 --> 08:08:21,640
Yes.

8403
08:08:22,100 --> 08:08:23,480
They're now Diamond 3.

8404
08:08:24,040 --> 08:08:25,480
They're now Diamond 3.

8405
08:08:26,440 --> 08:08:27,940
I don't understand.

8406
08:08:29,980 --> 08:08:31,640
I think they're dual support.

8407
08:08:37,360 --> 08:08:38,380
Oh shit.

8408
08:08:38,380 --> 08:08:40,040
Are they Moon Luna?

8409
08:08:40,760 --> 08:08:41,560
Because...

8410
08:08:43,240 --> 08:08:44,040
I...

8411
08:08:44,040 --> 08:08:45,780
This is my problem.

8412
08:08:46,700 --> 08:08:48,240
This is my problem.

8413
08:08:49,220 --> 08:08:50,640
I told you.

8414
08:08:54,180 --> 08:08:55,700
No, suffer.

8415
08:08:55,900 --> 08:08:56,700
I don't fucking care.

8416
08:08:56,780 --> 08:08:57,960
I'm done being nice.

8417
08:08:58,620 --> 08:08:59,380
You fail.

8418
08:08:59,760 --> 08:09:01,760
I'm done being nice.

8419
08:09:13,180 --> 08:09:14,440
Oh, that's...

8420
08:09:14,440 --> 08:09:15,380
No, I'm not going to be toxic.

8421
08:09:18,220 --> 08:09:20,060
Oh, he had 20 hours on her?

8422
08:09:20,320 --> 08:09:22,420
I was in fucking alpha, bitch.

8423
08:09:28,080 --> 08:09:29,860
I was in fucking alpha.

8424
08:09:30,100 --> 08:09:30,700
Were you...

8425
08:09:30,700 --> 08:09:31,780
Were you in alpha?

8426
08:09:32,460 --> 08:09:34,100
I'm done being nice.

8427
08:09:34,900 --> 08:09:36,000
I'm done.

8428
08:09:36,540 --> 08:09:37,140
I'm done being nice.

8429
08:09:37,140 --> 08:09:37,880
No!

8430
08:09:38,760 --> 08:09:40,220
SK, please.

8431
08:09:40,340 --> 08:09:41,700
I'm done being nice.

8432
08:09:41,800 --> 08:09:42,820
Let them fail.

8433
08:09:49,160 --> 08:09:50,980
They can't use that excuse.

8434
08:09:51,140 --> 08:09:52,580
I literally...

8435
08:09:52,580 --> 08:09:53,340
I was in alpha.

8436
08:09:55,320 --> 08:09:56,280
With Luna.

8437
08:10:02,060 --> 08:10:02,920
It's fine.

8438
08:10:03,020 --> 08:10:03,520
She'll learn.

8439
08:10:03,660 --> 08:10:04,420
I had to learn.

8440
08:10:06,680 --> 08:10:07,620
It's fine.

8441
08:10:10,620 --> 08:10:11,480
I had to learn.

8442
08:10:11,620 --> 08:10:12,260
It's fine.

8443
08:10:14,720 --> 08:10:16,400
Clearly, it's not that difficult.

8444
08:10:21,890 --> 08:10:22,390
I...

8445
08:10:23,950 --> 08:10:24,550
Okay.

8446
08:10:26,130 --> 08:10:28,810
I think they actually refused to heal me out of spite.

8447
08:10:29,110 --> 08:10:30,310
There's no way.

8448
08:10:31,530 --> 08:10:32,790
There's no way.

8449
08:10:33,330 --> 08:10:37,470
I legitimately, like, was fucking alive for five seconds.

8450
08:10:41,800 --> 08:10:42,640
It's fine.

8451
08:10:42,700 --> 08:10:43,820
I can just avoid them.

8452
08:10:51,730 --> 08:10:52,510
Jesus Christ.

8453
08:10:52,630 --> 08:10:53,470
Oh my God.

8454
08:10:53,610 --> 08:10:54,570
You're just feeding them.

8455
08:10:55,030 --> 08:10:56,310
I'm not even gonna go in.

8456
08:10:58,330 --> 08:11:00,230
I'm not going in.

8457
08:11:05,370 --> 08:11:09,650
I think what's funny is that SK is actually seeing my Tech Cloud lobbies now.

8458
08:11:10,310 --> 08:11:11,430
She's like, there's no way.

8459
08:11:11,670 --> 08:11:11,890
I...

8460
08:11:11,890 --> 08:11:12,690
I don't...

8461
08:11:12,690 --> 08:11:13,150
I wish...

8462
08:11:13,150 --> 08:11:14,670
I wish I don't have that issue.

8463
08:11:20,600 --> 08:11:21,040
What?!

8464
08:11:21,720 --> 08:11:22,580
Oh my God.

8465
08:11:22,620 --> 08:11:23,800
I even hit her too.

8466
08:11:28,330 --> 08:11:29,350
What the fuck?

8467
08:11:29,450 --> 08:11:31,190
They actually chased me.

8468
08:11:32,530 --> 08:11:36,070
I even used the thing that lets me heal.

8469
08:11:41,230 --> 08:11:41,550
Okay.

8470
08:11:46,230 --> 08:11:47,090
Oh.

8471
08:11:50,990 --> 08:11:51,650
Moon's gonna haunt.

8472
08:11:53,050 --> 08:11:54,770
Jesus Christ.

8473
08:11:58,670 --> 08:11:58,950
Oh.

8474
08:11:59,930 --> 08:12:00,130
Oh.

8475
08:12:00,130 --> 08:12:01,190
This is bad.

8476
08:12:02,010 --> 08:12:03,430
This is actually bad.

8477
08:12:03,650 --> 08:12:04,610
That's fine.

8478
08:12:05,630 --> 08:12:06,510
We're okay.

8479
08:12:09,510 --> 08:12:10,990
Yeah, I...

8480
08:12:10,990 --> 08:12:11,690
Oh no.

8481
08:12:12,250 --> 08:12:13,170
What the fuck?

8482
08:12:13,170 --> 08:12:14,390
We can fight this.

8483
08:12:14,870 --> 08:12:15,550
That's fine.

8484
08:12:15,790 --> 08:12:16,570
We'll fight this.

8485
08:12:19,490 --> 08:12:20,750
We can fight this.

8486
08:12:21,150 --> 08:12:22,270
I believe.

8487
08:12:26,540 --> 08:12:28,380
I believe we can fight this.

8488
08:12:32,710 --> 08:12:33,810
Oh no.

8489
08:12:33,810 --> 08:12:35,410
This is like Groot now.

8490
08:12:35,650 --> 08:12:36,370
Oh no.

8491
08:12:36,410 --> 08:12:37,450
They're on Groot now.

8492
08:12:40,330 --> 08:12:41,230
I hope...

8493
08:12:41,230 --> 08:12:43,530
I hope the Moon Luna avoids me.

8494
08:12:43,790 --> 08:12:46,290
So I don't have to waste my avoid slots.

8495
08:12:47,470 --> 08:12:48,030
God.

8496
08:12:51,110 --> 08:12:52,330
That's really it.

8497
08:12:52,710 --> 08:12:54,210
That's all I wish for.

8498
08:13:02,680 --> 08:13:04,700
If I'm lucky, she'll avoid me.

8499
08:13:06,380 --> 08:13:09,880
Just like how I'm avoiding support players.

8500
08:13:12,860 --> 08:13:14,220
Jesus Christ!

8501
08:13:14,980 --> 08:13:15,700
Oh no!

8502
08:13:15,940 --> 08:13:16,160
No!

8503
08:13:16,400 --> 08:13:16,920
Not again!

8504
08:13:17,180 --> 08:13:17,400
No!

8505
08:13:18,040 --> 08:13:18,720
No!

8506
08:13:20,140 --> 08:13:21,200
Not again!

8507
08:13:26,420 --> 08:13:27,360
Oh my god.

8508
08:13:27,420 --> 08:13:27,800
No!

8509
08:13:30,600 --> 08:13:31,280
Wait.

8510
08:13:31,420 --> 08:13:31,880
What?

8511
08:13:32,920 --> 08:13:34,300
Why do I have two SKs?

8512
08:13:34,460 --> 08:13:35,640
I just noticed that.

8513
08:13:38,180 --> 08:13:41,280
I just noticed we have two SKs.

8514
08:13:49,230 --> 08:13:49,830
Okay.

8515
08:13:50,110 --> 08:13:51,490
We gotta break this.

8516
08:13:52,090 --> 08:13:55,230
Guys, we gotta break this if we wanna help each other out.

8517
08:13:57,910 --> 08:13:59,310
Oh my god.

8518
08:13:59,470 --> 08:13:59,890
Really?

8519
08:14:00,110 --> 08:14:00,390
Okay.

8520
08:14:01,450 --> 08:14:02,090
It's fine.

8521
08:14:02,450 --> 08:14:04,270
We're all gonna be alive, right guys?

8522
08:14:05,610 --> 08:14:06,210
Guys.

8523
08:14:07,070 --> 08:14:07,610
Guys.

8524
08:14:08,770 --> 08:14:09,370
Yippee!

8525
08:14:09,550 --> 08:14:11,550
Being alive is so cool.

8526
08:14:13,610 --> 08:14:15,410
Okay, now I have it on the right SK.

8527
08:14:15,570 --> 08:14:16,710
I didn't realize there were two SKs.

8528
08:14:17,770 --> 08:14:20,870
I literally saw ES and then I assumed that was the right one.

8529
08:14:21,110 --> 08:14:22,230
But it wasn't.

8530
08:14:26,790 --> 08:14:27,190
Okay.

8531
08:14:31,410 --> 08:14:34,730
Alright, maybe I do need circus music at this point.

8532
08:14:38,870 --> 08:14:40,490
I think I might need circus music.

8533
08:14:40,490 --> 08:14:41,250
Circus music.

8534
08:14:50,230 --> 08:14:51,210
Penny is feeding?

8535
08:14:51,410 --> 08:14:52,230
No, 100%.

8536
08:14:52,230 --> 08:14:52,770
No, I agree.

8537
08:14:56,470 --> 08:14:58,390
I wish I could put on a show.

8538
08:15:04,110 --> 08:15:04,910
Oh no.

8539
08:15:05,130 --> 08:15:07,070
Not the stupid trees.

8540
08:15:08,130 --> 08:15:08,630
No!

8541
08:15:09,750 --> 08:15:10,350
Sorry!

8542
08:15:10,350 --> 08:15:11,130
Oh my god, Fortnite.

8543
08:15:14,910 --> 08:15:16,670
You fucking whore!

8544
08:15:17,350 --> 08:15:18,450
You whore!

8545
08:15:18,910 --> 08:15:20,030
You're so bad!

8546
08:15:20,030 --> 08:15:21,750
You didn't wanna die to fucking support!

8547
08:15:23,110 --> 08:15:24,630
You're such a whore!

8548
08:15:26,790 --> 08:15:29,790
You didn't wanna die to a support, you bitch!

8549
08:15:35,670 --> 08:15:36,270
Okay.

8550
08:15:38,350 --> 08:15:40,690
Push, push, push, push.

8551
08:15:40,930 --> 08:15:41,370
Quinn's right.

8552
08:15:44,290 --> 08:15:44,610
Okay.

8553
08:15:45,890 --> 08:15:46,770
It's fine.

8554
08:15:47,430 --> 08:15:47,990
It's fine.

8555
08:15:52,570 --> 08:15:54,330
Oh my god, I can't see shit.

8556
08:15:54,550 --> 08:15:57,250
I'm too scared to go through this.

8557
08:16:01,240 --> 08:16:01,780
Okay.

8558
08:16:04,460 --> 08:16:05,240
It's fine.

8559
08:16:05,380 --> 08:16:05,840
We're fine.

8560
08:16:06,160 --> 08:16:08,360
I'm perfectly sane right now.

8561
08:16:11,780 --> 08:16:13,460
I'm perfectly sane.

8562
08:16:15,300 --> 08:16:17,780
Wait, okay, so what did you mean by hero bands?

8563
08:16:17,900 --> 08:16:19,100
They're gonna have hero bands?

8564
08:16:20,800 --> 08:16:23,700
Oh no, I have to learn another character.

8565
08:16:24,780 --> 08:16:25,260
XD

8566
08:16:29,600 --> 08:16:33,720
I realized that they're gonna have hero bands just now.

8567
08:16:35,540 --> 08:16:37,020
Alright guys, we gotta live here.

8568
08:16:38,080 --> 08:16:39,680
We gotta live here.

8569
08:16:40,320 --> 08:16:41,560
We gotta...

8570
08:16:43,000 --> 08:16:44,280
Okay guys.

8571
08:16:45,560 --> 08:16:48,780
The Groot definitely has ult by the way, so...

8572
08:16:49,580 --> 08:16:51,260
So this is gonna be interesting.

8573
08:16:51,260 --> 08:16:51,300
Okay.

8574
08:17:02,710 --> 08:17:03,890
Not again!

8575
08:17:07,090 --> 08:17:08,870
Oh my god, it's smart though.

8576
08:17:08,970 --> 08:17:12,570
I have to admit, that's incredibly smart to do.

8577
08:17:12,930 --> 08:17:16,590
So that you can't have fucking one-tricks, which I...

8578
08:17:20,050 --> 08:17:21,490
Why is there...

8579
08:17:26,990 --> 08:17:28,430
Oh my god.

8580
08:17:29,970 --> 08:17:31,410
Dude, they are duo support!

8581
08:17:31,410 --> 08:17:32,850
They actually are!

8582
08:17:38,930 --> 08:17:42,130
Oh my god.

8583
08:17:43,570 --> 08:17:44,310
Fucking...

8584
08:17:44,310 --> 08:17:45,250
Oh my...

8585
08:17:45,250 --> 08:17:46,490
Okay, let's learn Mantis.

8586
08:17:47,030 --> 08:17:49,150
Let's learn Mantis.

8587
08:17:53,500 --> 08:17:54,340
Let's...

8588
08:17:54,340 --> 08:17:55,100
We're in.

8589
08:17:56,680 --> 08:17:57,860
Bro...

8590
08:17:57,860 --> 08:17:58,640
She...

8591
08:17:58,640 --> 08:18:00,640
Bro, I'm gonna...

8592
08:18:02,880 --> 08:18:03,840
Freaking...

8593
08:18:03,840 --> 08:18:06,220
How are these my lobbies?

8594
08:18:09,580 --> 08:18:15,240
How have you not encountered any of these lobbies before?

8595
08:18:16,320 --> 08:18:18,540
This has been my life.

8596
08:18:25,720 --> 08:18:26,680
How?

8597
08:18:26,980 --> 08:18:29,940
How has SK not been any...

8598
08:18:29,940 --> 08:18:31,460
I swear I'm not toxic.

8599
08:18:31,620 --> 08:18:32,660
Proceeds to...

8600
08:18:32,660 --> 08:18:37,200
Bro, this bitch doesn't know I've been in close alpha with Luna.

8601
08:18:37,700 --> 08:18:38,980
And she's like...

8602
08:18:38,980 --> 08:18:41,000
The thing is...

8603
08:18:41,000 --> 08:18:44,700
No, the craziest shit for me is that...

8604
08:18:44,700 --> 08:18:47,020
Look, I'm at the point where I'm gonna be fucking toxic.

8605
08:18:47,960 --> 08:18:49,000
Toxic, no filter.

8606
08:18:49,180 --> 08:18:51,300
Because I'm not fucking being nice anymore.

8607
08:18:51,980 --> 08:18:54,680
This bitch was like, I have 20 hours on Luna.

8608
08:18:54,900 --> 08:18:56,020
Like, bro, and?

8609
08:18:58,060 --> 08:18:58,580
Like...

8610
08:18:58,580 --> 08:18:59,320
Like...

8611
08:18:59,320 --> 08:19:00,540
And?

8612
08:19:01,240 --> 08:19:01,880
Like...

8613
08:19:01,880 --> 08:19:03,520
What the fuck is that?

8614
08:19:03,580 --> 08:19:04,340
You're flexed?

8615
08:19:04,400 --> 08:19:05,800
I have 20 hours.

8616
08:19:05,960 --> 08:19:08,060
I'm like, what the fuck is that flex?

8617
08:19:08,500 --> 08:19:10,020
Like, what do you want...

8618
08:19:10,020 --> 08:19:10,520
What?

8619
08:19:11,160 --> 08:19:12,560
What do you want me to say?

8620
08:19:16,100 --> 08:19:16,740
Like...

8621
08:19:16,740 --> 08:19:22,000
You think you're her just because you have 20 fucking hours on Luna?

8622
08:19:23,360 --> 08:19:24,000
Like...

8623
08:19:24,000 --> 08:19:26,640
Bro, 20 hours is fucking nothing.

8624
08:19:29,480 --> 08:19:31,420
How do you think you're her?

8625
08:19:33,100 --> 08:19:33,540
Like...

8626
08:19:36,920 --> 08:19:37,800
Bro, I'm...

8627
08:19:37,800 --> 08:19:39,120
Bro, I don't know what you want from me.

8628
08:19:39,140 --> 08:19:41,100
I'm fucking recharging right now.

8629
08:19:42,760 --> 08:19:44,920
Bro, I'm not fucking toxic though.

8630
08:19:55,910 --> 08:19:56,790
Jesus Christ.

8631
08:19:57,010 --> 08:19:58,050
Alright, let's get out of here.

8632
08:19:58,170 --> 08:19:59,590
I don't feel safe being here.

8633
08:20:01,050 --> 08:20:02,070
Oh my god.

8634
08:20:05,310 --> 08:20:08,310
Yeah, the game's been out for five days.

8635
08:20:08,650 --> 08:20:11,250
She's got four hours a day.

8636
08:20:11,790 --> 08:20:13,250
That's so true.

8637
08:20:13,890 --> 08:20:15,550
That's so true.

8638
08:20:16,690 --> 08:20:20,330
Bro, I've been playing Marble Rivals four hours a day, bro.

8639
08:20:20,550 --> 08:20:22,110
I'm fucking gimping Luna.

8640
08:20:22,590 --> 08:20:24,390
Like, holy shit.

8641
08:20:25,370 --> 08:20:27,150
That's actually crazy.

8642
08:20:29,310 --> 08:20:30,230
I'm not...

8643
08:20:30,230 --> 08:20:31,590
I'm actually gonna go unfilter here.

8644
08:20:31,710 --> 08:20:32,610
There's no fucking way.

8645
08:20:32,610 --> 08:20:33,800
I can't...

8646
08:20:34,230 --> 08:20:36,210
I can't handle these players.

8647
08:20:36,630 --> 08:20:38,290
I actually cannot.

8648
08:20:44,020 --> 08:20:45,020
Oh my god.

8649
08:20:45,400 --> 08:20:46,840
Please, be aware of your surroundings.

8650
08:20:54,200 --> 08:20:55,640
Okay, I'm all...

8651
08:20:55,640 --> 08:20:59,580
I'm gonna all in and swap to Cloak and Dagger.

8652
08:21:00,960 --> 08:21:02,580
Bro, I'm hitting four hours a day.

8653
08:21:02,620 --> 08:21:03,400
I'm fucking him.

8654
08:21:03,960 --> 08:21:04,200
Bro.

8655
08:21:12,180 --> 08:21:12,560
Alright.

8656
08:21:14,640 --> 08:21:16,160
I can't see shit.

8657
08:21:16,320 --> 08:21:16,960
Where are they?

8658
08:21:17,900 --> 08:21:18,900
Oh my god.

8659
08:21:20,120 --> 08:21:21,000
There we go.

8660
08:21:22,540 --> 08:21:23,800
Oh, we ulted.

8661
08:21:24,820 --> 08:21:26,600
Don't worry, we're undefeatable.

8662
08:21:34,370 --> 08:21:36,290
Oh my god!

8663
08:21:41,510 --> 08:21:42,270
How?!

8664
08:21:44,430 --> 08:21:47,410
Oh yeah, Luna is going so off.

8665
08:21:47,750 --> 08:21:48,030
Alright.

8666
08:21:49,030 --> 08:21:51,470
Fell through the map?!

8667
08:21:53,730 --> 08:21:54,450
Where is he?

8668
08:21:55,590 --> 08:21:56,830
Oh my god.

8669
08:22:19,880 --> 08:22:20,160
The...

8670
08:22:25,480 --> 08:22:27,960
Holy fuck.

8671
08:22:30,660 --> 08:22:32,180
The clown world.

8672
08:22:32,860 --> 08:22:34,020
The clown world.

8673
08:22:42,140 --> 08:22:44,440
I'm trying to help.

8674
08:22:46,780 --> 08:22:48,540
I'm fucking...

8675
08:22:49,720 --> 08:22:52,040
I'm fucking losing it.

8676
08:22:53,860 --> 08:22:54,300
Eventually.

8677
08:22:56,620 --> 08:22:57,680
Oh my god.

8678
08:22:57,820 --> 08:22:59,540
Zero, two, three.

8679
08:23:00,900 --> 08:23:02,240
Oh my god.

8680
08:23:02,240 --> 08:23:04,400
You can't.

8681
08:23:07,040 --> 08:23:08,180
Oh my god.

8682
08:23:08,380 --> 08:23:08,660
See?

8683
08:23:08,960 --> 08:23:11,660
Zero death when I main role.

8684
08:23:11,960 --> 08:23:15,980
Bro, no one told you to fucking play off role.

8685
08:23:16,080 --> 08:23:19,740
Just play three supports if you can't fucking play it.

8686
08:23:20,200 --> 08:23:21,100
Holy shit.

8687
08:23:23,400 --> 08:23:24,540
Welcome to the circus.

8688
08:23:24,820 --> 08:23:27,300
That is Marvel Rivals matchmaking.

8689
08:23:27,840 --> 08:23:28,840
Oh my god.

8690
08:23:29,560 --> 08:23:30,360
I need...

8691
08:23:30,980 --> 08:23:33,540
I need SK to avoid the other Luna player.

8692
08:23:33,560 --> 08:23:35,880
No, the other Luna player must have avoided me.

8693
08:23:36,180 --> 08:23:37,160
I'm pretty sure.

8694
08:23:37,600 --> 08:23:38,400
There's no way.

8695
08:23:41,260 --> 08:23:42,480
There's no way.

8696
08:23:43,220 --> 08:23:46,560
No, SK needs to restart the game.

8697
08:23:47,060 --> 08:23:48,540
Wait, how do I need to close the game?

8698
08:23:48,640 --> 08:23:49,880
Yeah, no, SK is restarting.

8699
08:23:52,200 --> 08:23:53,300
Oh my god.

8700
08:23:54,180 --> 08:23:55,820
I'm on the fucking clown circus.

8701
08:23:57,040 --> 08:23:57,840
I need music.

8702
08:23:58,120 --> 08:23:59,480
I need like calming music.

8703
08:24:01,800 --> 08:24:02,880
Am I winning?

8704
08:24:03,220 --> 08:24:03,820
I've had...

8705
08:24:03,820 --> 08:24:06,340
I've started having the worst luck possible.

8706
08:24:06,900 --> 08:24:09,360
Which is crazy to think about because like...

8707
08:24:11,340 --> 08:24:11,620
Like...

8708
08:24:11,900 --> 08:24:13,780
Oh, I didn't even like to look at the leaderboards.

8709
08:24:14,120 --> 08:24:15,600
What the fuck was the leaderboards?

8710
08:24:16,820 --> 08:24:17,600
Not leaderboards.

8711
08:24:17,760 --> 08:24:18,360
The statistic.

8712
08:24:18,640 --> 08:24:19,120
The history.

8713
08:24:21,900 --> 08:24:23,380
Are you fucking serious?

8714
08:24:25,740 --> 08:24:26,300
Like...

8715
08:24:27,680 --> 08:24:28,940
Oh my god.

8716
08:24:32,220 --> 08:24:35,760
I don't understand.

8717
08:24:35,880 --> 08:24:36,060
I don't understand.

8718
08:24:36,060 --> 08:24:37,780
How did SK not encounter any of these logs?

8719
08:24:38,140 --> 08:24:39,700
That's literally been like...

8720
08:24:39,700 --> 08:24:41,440
That's been like...

8721
08:24:41,440 --> 08:24:42,060
Oh my god.

8722
08:24:42,120 --> 08:24:44,220
I feel like that's been like 40% of my lobbies.

8723
08:24:44,700 --> 08:24:45,940
And then SK being like...

8724
08:24:49,120 --> 08:24:49,560
Feeling...

8725
08:24:50,040 --> 08:24:52,120
This is the first time I've had a lobby that bad.

8726
08:24:56,880 --> 08:24:58,460
There's no fucking way.

8727
08:24:58,940 --> 08:25:00,640
There's no fucking way.

8728
08:25:01,700 --> 08:25:06,240
I'm like, people can have other lobbies that's not as fucked up as the ones I've...

8729
08:25:06,240 --> 08:25:08,120
People actually have real lobbies?

8730
08:25:10,760 --> 08:25:13,220
People have real fucking lobbies?

8731
08:25:17,660 --> 08:25:18,860
I am losing it.

8732
08:25:19,220 --> 08:25:21,900
I am 100% losing it right now.

8733
08:25:25,800 --> 08:25:27,200
I'm gonna get background.

8734
08:25:27,200 --> 08:25:29,180
I'm actually gonna play with music.

8735
08:25:29,300 --> 08:25:30,200
I can't...

8736
08:25:31,360 --> 08:25:35,820
I'm at the point where I need like some nice music to make me happy.

8737
08:25:36,960 --> 08:25:39,300
I'm pulling out my Minecraft playlist.

8738
08:25:39,940 --> 08:25:41,800
You guys know my Minecraft playlist.

8739
08:25:44,160 --> 08:25:45,840
It calms me down.

8740
08:25:57,800 --> 08:25:58,920
Ba-dump.

8741
08:25:59,320 --> 08:25:59,880
Ba-dump.

8742
08:26:00,240 --> 08:26:01,860
Ba-da-da-da-dump.

8743
08:26:02,320 --> 08:26:02,960
Ba-dump.

8744
08:26:03,260 --> 08:26:03,800
Ba-dump.

8745
08:26:04,200 --> 08:26:05,400
Ba-dump-bump-bump.

8746
08:26:06,360 --> 08:26:07,640
Bum-ba-da-ba.

8747
08:26:08,000 --> 08:26:09,860
Bum-ba-da-da-da-dump.

8748
08:26:10,480 --> 08:26:11,700
Ba-da-da-da-ba.

8749
08:26:15,080 --> 08:26:17,160
That's not working.

8750
08:26:24,680 --> 08:26:25,790
Bum-ba-da-dump.

8751
08:26:29,110 --> 08:26:30,610
I can't play Duelist.

8752
08:26:30,730 --> 08:26:31,670
I'm not at a level.

8753
08:26:31,970 --> 08:26:33,330
If I play Duelist, I'm throwing.

8754
08:26:34,610 --> 08:26:36,850
Because the other DPS players I'm playing...

8755
08:26:39,830 --> 08:26:44,590
The other DPS players I'm playing against are actual DPS players.

8756
08:26:48,980 --> 08:26:49,640
Oh my god.

8757
08:26:49,760 --> 08:26:50,200
No, okay.

8758
08:26:50,300 --> 08:26:51,880
If you guys actually want real...

8759
08:26:51,880 --> 08:26:53,460
Okay, I think I might get...

8760
08:26:54,080 --> 08:26:56,120
I may or may not get hit by like...

8761
08:26:57,260 --> 08:26:57,700
DMCA.

8762
08:26:57,880 --> 08:27:01,680
Not DMCA, but my video might get unmonetized, but that's okay.

8763
08:27:02,960 --> 08:27:04,820
I think it'll be okay if it gets unmonetized.

8764
08:27:04,940 --> 08:27:05,600
That's fine.

8765
08:27:08,620 --> 08:27:09,480
That's fine.

8766
08:27:15,930 --> 08:27:17,490
Why don't we just listen to this?

8767
08:27:18,990 --> 08:27:20,370
For the entire time.

8768
08:27:33,560 --> 08:27:34,220
Bum-ba-dump.

8769
08:27:34,280 --> 08:27:35,360
Bum-ba-dump.

8770
08:27:35,520 --> 08:27:36,180
Bum-ba-dump.

8771
08:27:36,360 --> 08:27:36,540
Bum-ba-dump.

8772
08:27:36,540 --> 08:27:42,920
What if I just...

8773
08:27:42,920 --> 08:27:48,840
Would we all go crazy if I put this on the entire time?

8774
08:27:49,300 --> 08:27:51,200
Would we go crazy?

8775
08:27:55,260 --> 08:27:55,900
Okay.

8776
08:27:57,680 --> 08:28:01,700
How crazy would we get if this was our entire...

8777
08:28:29,320 --> 08:28:30,720
Wait.

8778
08:28:48,420 --> 08:28:50,340
Bum-ba-dump.

8779
08:28:50,560 --> 08:28:52,260
Bum-ba-dump.

8780
08:28:53,600 --> 08:28:54,760
Bum-ba-dump.

8781
08:28:58,260 --> 08:29:00,920
Bum-ba

8782
08:29:05,360 --> 08:29:05,860
-dump.

8783
08:29:06,220 --> 08:29:09,260
Okay, I got an idea too.

8784
08:29:14,180 --> 08:29:15,900
I have an idea.

8785
08:29:18,520 --> 08:29:19,880
I have an idea.

8786
08:29:19,880 --> 08:29:20,260
I think...

8787
08:29:20,260 --> 08:29:21,800
I think it's time.

8788
08:29:26,320 --> 08:29:28,940
I think it's time.

8789
08:29:30,900 --> 08:29:32,600
I think it's time.

8790
08:29:33,920 --> 08:29:35,560
Welcome to the freak show.

8791
08:29:40,620 --> 08:29:42,620
Bum-ba-dump.

8792
08:29:43,220 --> 08:29:43,980
Bum

8793
08:29:51,970 --> 08:29:53,230
-ba -dump.

8794
08:29:53,230 --> 08:29:54,930
Bum-ba-dump.

8795
08:29:55,370 --> 08:29:57,010
Bum-ba-dump.

8796
08:30:04,170 --> 08:30:07,070
Okay guys, let me pull something up.

8797
08:30:09,310 --> 08:30:11,950
Let me pull something up real quick.

8798
08:30:13,250 --> 08:30:15,290
Alright, is this the right thing?

8799
08:30:16,630 --> 08:30:17,190
Okay.

8800
08:30:20,070 --> 08:30:21,550
This is how I feel inside.

8801
08:30:23,310 --> 08:30:25,210
I feel like I've hit rock bottom.

8802
08:30:25,530 --> 08:30:28,030
I did not know this song has more to it.

8803
08:30:28,550 --> 08:30:31,670
This song has so much more- What the fuck?

8804
08:30:32,590 --> 08:30:35,250
This song is a lot longer than I expected.

8805
08:30:37,170 --> 08:30:39,430
Bum-ba-dump.

8806
08:30:39,430 --> 08:30:41,070
Bum-ba-dump.

8807
08:31:10,710 --> 08:31:11,610
Bum-ba-dump.

8808
08:31:13,290 --> 08:31:13,870
Bum-ba-dump.

8809
08:31:13,870 --> 08:31:15,290
It's my nose, guys.

8810
08:31:18,550 --> 08:31:19,670
There we go.

8811
08:31:37,270 --> 08:31:41,010
I thought this was gonna be a fast stream.

8812
08:31:41,330 --> 08:31:44,170
At best it'd be five hours.

8813
08:31:45,410 --> 08:31:50,350
Oh my god, there's not enough gamers on anymore.

8814
08:32:14,170 --> 08:32:15,390
Bum-ba-dump.

8815
08:32:18,200 --> 08:32:19,800
Bum-ba-dump.

8816
08:32:22,110 --> 08:32:23,570
Bum-ba-dump.

8817
08:32:28,630 --> 08:32:33,950
Oh my god.

8818
08:32:35,450 --> 08:32:37,330
I can't believe it.

8819
08:32:38,170 --> 08:32:41,650
How is it like this?

8820
08:32:45,430 --> 08:32:48,090
I can't believe it.

8821
08:32:54,590 --> 08:32:55,150
Oh.

8822
08:32:57,830 --> 08:32:59,310
Oh, we got in.

8823
08:32:59,990 --> 08:33:01,370
This is gonna be our music.

8824
08:33:09,970 --> 08:33:15,290
I swear, this fucking horror is also a Luna one trick.

8825
08:33:15,690 --> 08:33:17,110
I swear to- Oh, thank god.

8826
08:33:17,210 --> 08:33:18,330
Okay, there we go.

8827
08:33:19,250 --> 08:33:20,950
Alright, I can't- I'm sorry.

8828
08:33:21,190 --> 08:33:24,950
I'm at a point where I'm not filtering myself anymore.

8829
08:33:25,170 --> 08:33:26,550
I'm too toxic right now.

8830
08:33:27,130 --> 08:33:30,050
Okay, we're turning down the music a little bit lower though.

8831
08:33:31,130 --> 08:33:31,590
Okay.

8832
08:33:33,030 --> 08:33:34,050
I can't.

8833
08:33:34,190 --> 08:33:35,430
I can't.

8834
08:33:37,610 --> 08:33:40,510
It's funnier if she suffers.

8835
08:33:41,430 --> 08:33:44,890
Wait, please.

8836
08:33:44,890 --> 08:33:45,810
Alright.

8837
08:33:46,530 --> 08:33:48,410
I'm going insane.

8838
08:33:49,030 --> 08:33:57,830
Surefour, I bumped into- I bumped into fucking three, four games in a row where everybody was a support main.

8839
08:33:58,090 --> 08:33:59,830
Surefour, I'm fucking going crazy.

8840
08:34:00,390 --> 08:34:04,670
I was so- I was so close.

8841
08:34:05,290 --> 08:34:09,990
I was so close to top 500, Surefour, you don't understand.

8842
08:34:09,990 --> 08:34:16,470
And then I bumped into two Luna one tricks in the last two games.

8843
08:34:16,470 --> 08:34:22,170
I had two Luna one tricks and then Surefour, I t-ranked Surefour.

8844
08:34:24,650 --> 08:34:33,590
And then I got Asuka to play with me and then she was like, I've never had these pro- She's like, this is the worst lobby I've ever played in.

8845
08:34:33,810 --> 08:34:36,850
And I was like, these were like my past six games.

8846
08:34:36,850 --> 08:34:41,430
I remember my past six games, Surefour.

8847
08:34:43,010 --> 08:34:45,950
She's never experienced my lobbies before.

8848
08:34:47,430 --> 08:34:49,310
Our lobbies, you were there.

8849
08:34:49,450 --> 08:34:53,030
You had some of some- we had some fucking- fucking shit lobbies today.

8850
08:35:02,990 --> 08:35:05,990
Oh my gosh, she's so low though.

8851
08:35:05,990 --> 08:35:07,870
That's some sucks.

8852
08:35:12,150 --> 08:35:13,510
I'm okay.

8853
08:35:14,930 --> 08:35:17,290
Pain drop- pain makes us closer together.

8854
08:35:18,390 --> 08:35:19,690
Pain unites us, guys.

8855
08:35:29,810 --> 08:35:31,350
Pain makes us better.

8856
08:35:31,810 --> 08:35:32,750
It builds character.

8857
08:35:34,070 --> 08:35:34,770
You know it.

8858
08:35:48,410 --> 08:35:49,450
It's okay.

8859
08:35:49,450 --> 08:35:49,830
I'm with you.

8860
08:35:50,270 --> 08:35:51,750
You need me.

8861
08:35:51,750 --> 08:35:52,410
Oh,

8862
08:36:00,790 --> 08:36:09,850
he's fucking dead.

8863
08:36:11,590 --> 08:36:13,750
Oh my god, he's sicking.

8864
08:36:14,470 --> 08:36:15,370
Woah!

8865
08:36:16,570 --> 08:36:17,690
He's also dead!

8866
08:36:19,390 --> 08:36:20,150
Let's do it!

8867
08:36:21,050 --> 08:36:21,890
That's right!

8868
08:36:29,870 --> 08:36:31,990
I'm gonna dance!

8869
08:36:45,150 --> 08:36:48,130
All I'm saying is pain brings us closer together.

8870
08:36:48,650 --> 08:36:50,710
It makes us stronger as people.

8871
08:36:51,810 --> 08:36:54,370
I grow- it's called building character.

8872
08:36:55,290 --> 08:36:57,690
We're building so much character right now.

8873
08:36:58,270 --> 08:36:59,750
Oh my god, he's so low.

8874
08:37:18,090 --> 08:37:21,490
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

8875
08:37:25,670 --> 08:37:27,250
Guys, can you guys kill anything?

8876
08:37:27,750 --> 08:37:28,890
That's all I ask for.

8877
08:37:41,750 --> 08:37:44,290
You know, fuck that group in particular.

8878
08:37:44,810 --> 08:37:46,010
Oh, you thought this was over?

8879
08:37:46,110 --> 08:37:47,010
We go again.

8880
08:37:49,690 --> 08:37:51,470
What did your first say?

8881
08:37:52,030 --> 08:37:53,190
What did he say?

8882
08:37:57,990 --> 08:37:58,590
Wow.

8883
08:38:03,770 --> 08:38:06,130
Guys, I didn't see what he said.

8884
08:38:08,730 --> 08:38:10,910
Bro, that's fucked up, man.

8885
08:38:12,070 --> 08:38:18,450
After everything- after all the healing I did for you, that's fucked up.

8886
08:38:19,530 --> 08:38:23,210
I literally gave you so much fucking healing, man.

8887
08:38:26,870 --> 08:38:28,230
Guys, this is making me a better player.

8888
08:38:28,350 --> 08:38:29,190
You guys just don't understand.

8889
08:38:32,750 --> 08:38:33,730
See, look at that.

8890
08:38:33,730 --> 08:38:34,670
LOL

8891
08:38:52,950 --> 08:38:57,330
Yeah, but you were alive to kill everything, surefour.

8892
08:38:58,450 --> 08:39:01,990
You were alive so you could kill everything.

8893
08:39:02,760 --> 08:39:04,590
Pain builds character to character.

8894
08:39:05,270 --> 08:39:08,330
A clown that was wearing Gremlin Tidus, but still.

8895
08:39:11,710 --> 08:39:16,230
Yeah, don't forget who- it's Mutual Penis.

8896
08:39:26,610 --> 08:39:29,130
Are you happy and you know it?

8897
08:39:29,190 --> 08:39:30,010
Clap your hands.

8898
08:39:35,950 --> 08:39:39,250
We're back to plat 2, but it's okay.

8899
08:39:40,390 --> 08:39:42,190
It just makes me a stronger person.

8900
08:39:42,330 --> 08:39:45,130
It makes me a better player than surefour because I've suffered.

8901
08:39:45,950 --> 08:39:48,830
I've had character development, he hasn't.

8902
08:39:49,370 --> 08:39:52,050
He didn't go through the pain I went through.

8903
08:39:53,770 --> 08:39:56,050
Chat is losing it.

8904
08:40:00,010 --> 08:40:02,310
It just makes me a better player.

8905
08:40:03,130 --> 08:40:04,010
Let's dance.

8906
08:40:06,770 --> 08:40:07,510
That's right.

8907
08:40:08,330 --> 08:40:13,250
If you suffer with me, then you'd be a better player than me, but you don't.

8908
08:40:14,570 --> 08:40:15,510
You don't suffer.

8909
08:40:15,650 --> 08:40:17,870
You don't go through my elo hell.

8910
08:40:19,810 --> 08:40:22,050
I'm not paying attention anymore.

8911
08:40:23,390 --> 08:40:25,430
It's okay, I'm locking in now.

8912
08:40:26,050 --> 08:40:27,850
No, that's after this.

8913
08:40:28,010 --> 08:40:29,630
I'm locked after my death.

8914
08:40:41,850 --> 08:40:44,170
Yeah, but that's League.

8915
08:40:44,370 --> 08:40:45,610
This isn't League.

8916
08:40:45,850 --> 08:40:47,510
This is Marvel Rival.

8917
08:40:47,610 --> 08:40:48,450
It's different.

8918
08:40:49,430 --> 08:40:50,890
It's so different.

8919
08:40:55,980 --> 08:40:56,940
That's different.

8920
08:40:57,700 --> 08:41:00,000
You don't know true suffering in Marvel.

8921
08:41:00,300 --> 08:41:01,040
Oh my god, bro.

8922
08:41:01,200 --> 08:41:01,860
Poor Gatguy.

8923
08:41:02,320 --> 08:41:04,060
That was not intentional.

8924
08:41:06,580 --> 08:41:07,740
You know that.

8925
08:41:08,100 --> 08:41:11,620
You know that you haven't suffered yet in Marvel Rivals.

8926
08:41:12,340 --> 08:41:12,940
You don't know that.

8927
08:41:13,000 --> 08:41:16,040
You don't know the pain of having encountered two Luna one-tricks.

8928
08:41:16,940 --> 08:41:19,080
Luna one-tricks is like two games in a row.

8929
08:41:19,540 --> 08:41:21,060
You've never had to go through that.

8930
08:41:22,320 --> 08:41:26,460
You also didn't go through... you also didn't go through...

8931
08:41:28,100 --> 08:41:30,900
...three plus support mains in four games in a row.

8932
08:41:33,360 --> 08:41:35,300
You haven't gone through that in Marvel Rivals.

8933
08:41:35,420 --> 08:41:37,920
You might have gone through that in Overwatch, but not in Marvel Rivals.

8934
08:41:40,020 --> 08:41:41,700
Not in Marvel Rivals.

8935
08:41:41,860 --> 08:41:42,400
That's different.

8936
08:41:45,820 --> 08:41:47,400
Jesus Christ, live.

8937
08:41:48,160 --> 08:41:49,060
Fucking live.

8938
08:41:49,060 --> 08:41:53,000
Oh my god, how the fuck are you still alive?

8939
08:41:53,140 --> 08:41:56,320
Oh my god, he was not living.

8940
08:41:59,020 --> 08:42:01,020
Oh no, who is he grunting?

8941
08:42:05,960 --> 08:42:07,520
4-0 kills DPS.

8942
08:42:13,060 --> 08:42:14,380
You haven't suffered.

8943
08:42:16,140 --> 08:42:17,560
You don't know what this is like.

8944
08:42:19,220 --> 08:42:20,980
I'm dancing.

8945
08:42:21,360 --> 08:42:23,280
I'm gonna dance.

8946
08:42:23,640 --> 08:42:28,500
I'm gonna fucking dance and you can't do anything about it.

8947
08:42:38,050 --> 08:42:40,220
Oh my god.

8948
08:42:44,000 --> 08:42:45,580
Oh my god, it's working.

8949
08:42:46,040 --> 08:42:47,660
The music is working.

8950
08:42:48,740 --> 08:42:51,580
Oh my god, who would have thought this was a game?

8951
08:42:52,540 --> 08:42:55,040
Who would have thought it's working?

8952
08:42:55,580 --> 08:42:59,220
Oh my god, this is the fastest game I've ever found so far.

8953
08:42:59,220 --> 08:42:59,440
It's not fair.

8954
08:43:02,740 --> 08:43:03,880
Doshir for 9.

8955
08:43:04,080 --> 08:43:05,640
I want to get top 500.

8956
08:43:05,860 --> 08:43:06,480
It's not fair.

8957
08:43:06,600 --> 08:43:08,060
You get to be in top 500.

8958
08:43:08,260 --> 08:43:09,200
I did it.

8959
08:43:13,290 --> 08:43:14,390
It's not fair.

8960
08:43:14,530 --> 08:43:15,990
You got to experience it.

8961
08:43:16,110 --> 08:43:17,330
I haven't yet.

8962
08:43:20,850 --> 08:43:23,030
I didn't get to experience it.

8963
08:43:23,130 --> 08:43:23,870
It's not fair.

8964
08:43:24,510 --> 08:43:26,310
Oh my god, I'm getting a chance to walk in the snow.

8965
08:43:36,960 --> 08:43:38,880
Okay, I can do this.

8966
08:43:44,520 --> 08:43:45,080
Okay,

8967
08:44:02,120 --> 08:44:03,180
this is it.

8968
08:44:07,130 --> 08:44:09,610
The fuck are they talking about?

8969
08:44:10,870 --> 08:44:12,250
It's not me because I'm streaming.

8970
08:44:14,550 --> 08:44:14,990
Hahaha.

8971
08:44:19,030 --> 08:44:20,610
No one knows who I am.

8972
08:44:20,690 --> 08:44:21,850
I'm a nobody here.

8973
08:44:23,210 --> 08:44:24,290
I'm a nobody.

8974
08:44:25,070 --> 08:44:27,710
No one knows who I am until I put the mask on.

8975
08:44:27,710 --> 08:44:38,040
The battle starts in 5... 4... 3...

8976
08:44:38,040 --> 08:44:50,680
I want to make a 4-stack.

8977
08:44:53,440 --> 08:44:54,220
Imagine.

8978
08:44:54,220 --> 08:44:57,380
Imagine if I could make a fucking 4-stack right now.

8979
08:44:57,380 --> 08:45:00,680
Okay, I should pay attention now.

8980
08:45:01,960 --> 08:45:03,640
I'm gonna pay attention.

8981
08:45:05,180 --> 08:45:06,760
I'm gonna pay attention now.

8982
08:45:06,980 --> 08:45:08,640
I was not paying attention.

8983
08:45:09,700 --> 08:45:11,880
I was actually fucking around.

8984
08:45:16,340 --> 08:45:20,780
Okay, focus now for real.

8985
08:45:22,800 --> 08:45:28,840
I was just thinking about how easy this game would be if you fucking 4-stacked.

8986
08:45:32,660 --> 08:45:34,780
But then I'm a fucking...

8987
08:45:38,040 --> 08:45:40,940
Oh my god, please do anything.

8988
08:45:43,060 --> 08:45:46,040
Please do anything, my tanks.

8989
08:45:49,700 --> 08:45:52,040
Jesus Christ, my tanks.

8990
08:45:52,040 --> 08:45:56,480
Oh my god, you guys are not okay.

8991
08:45:57,380 --> 08:46:00,840
You guys are definitely not okay right now.

8992
08:46:01,540 --> 08:46:05,260
Oh my god, please keep blowing water on me.

8993
08:46:14,560 --> 08:46:15,880
Oh no.

8994
08:46:23,700 --> 08:46:26,720
No, no, no, no, no.

8995
08:46:30,310 --> 08:46:32,330
Oh my god!

8996
08:46:35,190 --> 08:46:36,450
Where's my...

8997
08:46:38,150 --> 08:46:39,190
Oh, fuck!

8998
08:46:40,030 --> 08:46:41,750
Oh, I don't have cover anymore, goodbye!

8999
08:46:46,550 --> 08:46:49,230
My cover fucking blew up.

9000
08:46:51,730 --> 08:46:54,430
I think we need... I hate playing against Brute.

9001
08:46:55,550 --> 08:46:56,390
Okay.

9002
08:47:02,730 --> 08:47:04,450
Bro, where do I go?

9003
08:47:04,810 --> 08:47:06,570
There was nowhere else to go.

9004
08:47:07,970 --> 08:47:09,010
It was...

9005
08:47:11,150 --> 08:47:13,850
It was actually... Oh, I'm sorry, bro.

9006
08:47:14,270 --> 08:47:15,570
Oh wait, no, I'm not!

9007
08:47:18,310 --> 08:47:21,930
I was gonna say you might be dead because fucking Brute.

9008
08:47:25,450 --> 08:47:26,870
Okay, there you go.

9009
08:47:30,310 --> 08:47:32,690
I'm trying so hard to keep you alive, please.

9010
08:47:32,690 --> 08:47:33,810
Please.

9011
08:47:34,750 --> 08:47:35,430
Please.

9012
08:47:48,480 --> 08:47:49,840
He lives!

9013
08:47:49,980 --> 08:47:50,320
Okay.

9014
08:47:53,440 --> 08:47:54,400
Guys, I think...

9015
08:47:56,040 --> 08:47:58,220
I think somebody is underperforming.

9016
08:47:59,340 --> 08:48:00,780
And I hope it's not me.

9017
08:48:02,400 --> 08:48:03,080
Alright.

9018
08:48:05,580 --> 08:48:06,700
Okay, it's fine.

9019
08:48:07,120 --> 08:48:07,500
It's fine.

9020
08:48:11,020 --> 08:48:11,860
It's fine.

9021
08:48:13,920 --> 08:48:16,340
Somebody is the weak link here.

9022
08:48:17,600 --> 08:48:19,920
And I hope it's not me.

9023
08:48:22,680 --> 08:48:24,820
I don't know, maybe you'll live.

9024
08:48:25,300 --> 08:48:26,460
Maybe you'll live.

9025
08:48:26,680 --> 08:48:27,800
I don't fucking know.

9026
08:48:33,300 --> 08:48:34,820
Poor Kinkedus.

9027
08:48:36,340 --> 08:48:36,700
Alright.

9028
08:48:43,880 --> 08:48:45,700
Time to switch things up.

9029
08:48:48,680 --> 08:48:49,880
Holy shit.

9030
08:48:51,820 --> 08:48:53,460
Surely it's not me, right?

9031
08:48:53,960 --> 08:48:54,760
I don't think so.

9032
08:48:54,840 --> 08:48:55,460
I haven't died.

9033
08:48:55,460 --> 08:48:56,080
Oh, I did die.

9034
08:48:56,320 --> 08:48:57,440
What are two times?

9035
08:48:59,500 --> 08:49:00,500
Oh my God.

9036
08:49:13,880 --> 08:49:16,880
I don't... I don't... I don't...

9037
08:49:22,940 --> 08:49:25,580
Oh no, I'm a full-on Luna 1 trick.

9038
08:49:25,800 --> 08:49:30,080
I was planning on learning other characters after, you know, touching top 500 today.

9039
08:49:30,380 --> 08:49:31,840
But now I...

9040
08:49:32,420 --> 08:49:34,720
I mean, I still will, but like...

9041
08:49:36,320 --> 08:49:37,640
I hope I get it today.

9042
08:49:37,640 --> 08:49:37,760
Okay.

9043
08:49:42,220 --> 08:49:43,580
That's really it.

9044
08:49:43,860 --> 08:49:45,860
I do hope it happens today.

9045
08:49:49,860 --> 08:49:51,460
That's really it.

9046
08:49:58,470 --> 08:50:00,810
Oh no, I was so close too.

9047
08:50:01,090 --> 08:50:02,830
That was the... That's the worst part.

9048
08:50:03,390 --> 08:50:05,330
When you're like...

9049
08:50:05,330 --> 08:50:07,850
So close to it.

9050
08:50:08,710 --> 08:50:13,310
And then like you just had such an unlucky streak afterwards.

9051
08:50:13,790 --> 08:50:15,070
Oh my God.

9052
08:50:15,290 --> 08:50:16,930
That's the worst part, I think.

9053
08:50:20,470 --> 08:50:21,130
Oh

9054
08:50:31,430 --> 08:50:32,310
my God.

9055
08:50:32,390 --> 08:50:34,150
It's just the fucking...

9056
08:50:34,930 --> 08:50:37,470
It's the... It's the...

9057
08:50:37,470 --> 08:50:38,270
The walls.

9058
08:50:38,950 --> 08:50:42,350
We're playing against some really, really good group players too.

9059
08:50:43,010 --> 08:50:44,790
That's... Oh my God, how are you dead?

9060
08:50:44,790 --> 08:50:44,970
How are you dead?

9061
08:50:47,430 --> 08:50:48,410
Okay, you're back.

9062
08:50:48,530 --> 08:50:49,030
That's good.

9063
08:50:51,430 --> 08:50:52,950
Like, what the fuck?

9064
08:51:03,220 --> 08:51:03,920
Oh my God.

9065
08:51:06,280 --> 08:51:07,160
Like, what?!

9066
08:51:17,390 --> 08:51:18,510
I need to blow my nose.

9067
08:51:18,610 --> 08:51:19,310
I ran out of clinics.

9068
08:51:19,550 --> 08:51:20,070
I'll be right back.

9069
08:51:20,330 --> 08:51:22,930
I ran out of paper... paper...

9070
08:51:22,930 --> 08:51:24,670
Clinics and napkins.

9071
08:51:24,890 --> 08:51:25,550
I'll be right back.

9072
08:52:03,480 --> 08:52:04,520
Oh my God.

9073
08:52:04,520 --> 08:52:06,440
The cues are instant though.

9074
08:52:06,540 --> 08:52:07,540
That's nice.

9075
08:52:11,280 --> 08:52:12,360
No, please.

9076
08:52:13,220 --> 08:52:15,540
Okay, I could lock it in before it was too late.

9077
08:52:18,220 --> 08:52:20,060
I'm glad she's playing in my hell.

9078
08:52:20,780 --> 08:52:22,920
I need people to... What did she say?

9079
08:52:27,520 --> 08:52:31,020
I haven't put... I haven't put on my headphones yet.

9080
08:52:33,420 --> 08:52:35,360
Now this is our hell.

9081
08:52:36,020 --> 08:52:36,700
What does it say?

9082
08:52:45,770 --> 08:52:47,630
Is this the twilight zone?

9083
08:52:47,930 --> 08:52:50,110
Welcome to my personal twilight zone.

9084
08:52:53,150 --> 08:52:55,950
I can get us tank and DPS play...

9085
08:52:57,070 --> 08:52:58,610
I told you!

9086
08:52:58,910 --> 08:52:59,830
Everyone stacks!

9087
08:53:01,870 --> 08:53:03,330
Oh my God.

9088
08:53:03,930 --> 08:53:05,750
I told you.

9089
08:53:06,590 --> 08:53:07,530
Oh my God.

9090
08:53:11,510 --> 08:53:13,810
This is why you don't experience my hell.

9091
08:53:13,830 --> 08:53:15,330
I solo duel.

9092
08:53:15,710 --> 08:53:16,690
It's fucking crazy.

9093
08:53:17,290 --> 08:53:19,990
It gives me more chances to fucking suffer.

9094
08:53:23,930 --> 08:53:27,030
You're stuck in... You're stuck in my lobbies.

9095
08:53:27,210 --> 08:53:30,070
No, you're gonna experience 5am lobbies.

9096
08:53:30,730 --> 08:53:31,770
Let's get it.

9097
08:53:32,970 --> 08:53:34,170
We suffer.

9098
08:53:35,490 --> 08:53:36,850
No, no one escapes.

9099
08:53:40,450 --> 08:53:43,050
No one escapes here.

9100
08:53:43,830 --> 08:53:45,850
That one hurts.

9101
08:53:50,590 --> 08:53:52,170
That was one.

9102
08:54:10,200 --> 08:54:12,840
What the fuck is wrong with you?

9103
08:54:15,220 --> 08:54:16,760
Oh my God.

9104
08:54:16,880 --> 08:54:17,700
He was so low.

9105
08:54:21,860 --> 08:54:22,980
Will I?

9106
08:54:24,300 --> 08:54:25,600
It's too late.

9107
08:54:25,720 --> 08:54:26,480
I'm in too deep.

9108
08:54:27,180 --> 08:54:29,400
I'm in too fucking deep, guys.

9109
08:54:30,680 --> 08:54:32,320
I'm in too deep.

9110
08:54:32,940 --> 08:54:36,280
I don't escape the Marvel Rivals play basement.

9111
08:54:37,280 --> 08:54:37,880
Yeah.

9112
08:54:58,590 --> 08:54:59,490
That's right.

9113
08:55:00,970 --> 08:55:02,870
I'm a better player now.

9114
08:55:05,530 --> 08:55:07,070
I went through hell.

9115
08:55:07,210 --> 08:55:09,410
I'm a better fucking player than all of you.

9116
08:55:14,300 --> 08:55:16,140
Like, I built my character.

9117
08:55:17,500 --> 08:55:20,500
Okay, like, I don't... I can't fucking save you there.

9118
08:55:22,620 --> 08:55:24,560
Like, Jesus Christ.

9119
08:55:29,970 --> 08:55:30,570
Alright.

9120
08:55:35,650 --> 08:55:36,490
Sorry.

9121
08:55:45,350 --> 08:55:47,590
Alright, I'm going to ult in.

9122
08:55:49,130 --> 08:55:50,870
Okay, I'm actually going to focus.

9123
08:55:58,860 --> 08:55:59,700
Oh.

9124
08:56:00,240 --> 08:56:01,080
Oh.

9125
08:56:02,120 --> 08:56:03,880
Oh my God.

9126
08:56:03,880 --> 08:56:08,960
Please, get in my... We're going to be doing this.

9127
08:56:09,620 --> 08:56:12,460
Oh, I'm scared now.

9128
08:56:13,520 --> 08:56:15,680
Because I don't know where that is.

9129
08:56:16,460 --> 08:56:17,940
Like, I legitimately don't know.

9130
08:56:19,980 --> 08:56:21,840
Oh, this is where I die.

9131
08:56:26,270 --> 08:56:28,330
I don't know where that was.

9132
08:56:30,630 --> 08:56:32,610
Rocket Raccoon is still alive!

9133
08:56:32,750 --> 08:56:33,610
Come to him!

9134
08:56:34,610 --> 08:56:36,010
He'll keep you alive!

9135
08:56:36,150 --> 08:56:36,870
No, he's hiding.

9136
08:56:37,010 --> 08:56:37,650
He's scared.

9137
08:56:40,630 --> 08:56:42,430
Oh, they see you, my dude.

9138
08:56:45,110 --> 08:56:47,330
No, I got frozen!

9139
08:56:48,250 --> 08:56:49,870
No, I couldn't touch it!

9140
08:56:57,350 --> 08:56:58,130
It's okay.

9141
08:56:58,430 --> 08:57:00,090
We can get it back.

9142
08:57:00,250 --> 08:57:01,210
Oh wait, we have a portal.

9143
08:57:01,610 --> 08:57:02,290
Oh my God.

9144
08:57:02,450 --> 08:57:03,610
Oh, we got off.

9145
08:57:05,750 --> 08:57:07,670
Yo, we're back at Plat 2.

9146
08:57:20,860 --> 08:57:21,540
Welcome.

9147
08:57:23,580 --> 08:57:26,040
Welcome to the circus.

9148
08:57:55,860 --> 08:57:56,980
Ba-ba-bam!

9149
08:57:57,700 --> 08:57:58,920
Ba-ba-bam!

9150
08:57:59,160 --> 08:58:00,100
I can't hear you.

9151
08:58:00,320 --> 08:58:01,360
I don't fucking know.

9152
08:58:01,440 --> 08:58:02,760
Why do you recognize that name?

9153
08:58:09,540 --> 08:58:10,020
Oh,

9154
08:58:16,100 --> 08:58:16,300
what?

9155
08:58:16,440 --> 08:58:18,040
They didn't fucking push in yet?

9156
08:58:19,100 --> 08:58:20,080
Where the fuck were they?

9157
08:58:21,280 --> 08:58:22,400
Oh, he's dead.

9158
08:58:22,500 --> 08:58:22,940
That's where they are.

9159
08:58:26,500 --> 08:58:27,700
Oh, that's smart.

9160
08:58:27,900 --> 08:58:28,920
Wait, these guys are coordinated.

9161
08:58:29,140 --> 08:58:31,000
I swear, this is a fucking 6-stack.

9162
08:58:31,480 --> 08:58:32,780
Fucking nerds.

9163
08:58:32,940 --> 08:58:35,260
Actual nerds are playing 6-stack at this hour.

9164
08:58:35,660 --> 08:58:36,480
Just for winning.

9165
08:58:42,380 --> 08:58:43,420
Yeah, I know.

9166
08:58:49,560 --> 08:58:50,120
Fight!

9167
08:58:52,580 --> 08:58:55,240
It's time to dance!

9168
08:58:55,900 --> 08:58:57,160
Wa-ha-ha-ha!

9169
08:59:00,000 --> 08:59:00,560
Oh, shit.

9170
08:59:01,100 --> 08:59:02,040
Nevermind, I don't want to dance anymore.

9171
08:59:02,080 --> 08:59:02,740
I don't want to dance anymore.

9172
08:59:02,760 --> 08:59:03,520
I don't want to dance anymore.

9173
08:59:03,520 --> 08:59:04,520
I don't want to dance anymore.

9174
08:59:04,520 --> 08:59:06,400
I don't want to dance anymore.

9175
08:59:09,360 --> 08:59:12,160
I don't want to dance anymore.

9176
08:59:31,960 --> 08:59:32,620
I

9177
08:59:36,100 --> 08:59:42,640
need to cover right here.

9178
08:59:49,090 --> 08:59:50,090
Oh, this is bad.

9179
08:59:50,610 --> 08:59:52,110
This is real bad.

9180
08:59:55,950 --> 08:59:56,970
Oh, what?

9181
08:59:57,230 --> 08:59:58,710
Oh my god, even Seer.

9182
09:00:03,220 --> 09:00:05,020
Okay, I need to up my game sound.

9183
09:00:07,020 --> 09:00:08,880
Sorry, I've been listening to this.

9184
09:00:09,520 --> 09:00:10,600
To this BGM.

9185
09:00:14,650 --> 09:00:16,410
Oh, he's getting back.

9186
09:00:16,410 --> 09:00:17,010
Okay.

9187
09:00:27,890 --> 09:00:29,210
Jesus Christ!

9188
09:00:31,490 --> 09:00:32,910
Bro, are you okay?

9189
09:00:37,440 --> 09:00:39,800
Oh my god, how are you alive?

9190
09:00:46,570 --> 09:00:48,890
She is one of the best supports.

9191
09:00:49,330 --> 09:00:51,250
Her, Mantis, and Cloaking Dagger.

9192
09:01:07,820 --> 09:01:08,480
Let's see.

9193
09:01:08,480 --> 09:01:09,300
Let's all hope you all live.

9194
09:01:09,880 --> 09:01:11,200
Let's hope you live, guys.

9195
09:01:11,520 --> 09:01:12,440
Let's hope you live.

9196
09:01:13,140 --> 09:01:15,400
Let's hope you fucking live, guys.

9197
09:01:20,530 --> 09:01:21,330
Let's see.

9198
09:01:23,210 --> 09:01:25,110
Let's hope you all live, you all live!

9199
09:01:25,110 --> 09:01:25,790
Congratulations.

9200
09:01:28,690 --> 09:01:29,570
Oh...

9201
09:01:31,630 --> 09:01:32,510
Let's go!

9202
09:01:36,300 --> 09:01:37,060
You're right.

9203
09:01:37,500 --> 09:01:38,100
You know what?

9204
09:01:38,660 --> 09:01:40,260
I'm gonna heal you anyway, bitch.

9205
09:01:44,180 --> 09:01:46,400
Oh my god!

9206
09:01:46,840 --> 09:01:48,800
Oh my god!

9207
09:01:48,980 --> 09:01:49,940
Let's just...

9208
09:01:49,940 --> 09:01:51,480
fuck everybody, I guess.

9209
09:01:52,280 --> 09:01:54,920
Jesus Christ, like...

9210
09:01:54,920 --> 09:01:56,240
Um...

9211
09:01:56,240 --> 09:01:59,640
What do you mean?!

9212
09:02:01,780 --> 09:02:03,140
I ulted...

9213
09:02:06,840 --> 09:02:07,520
What?!

9214
09:02:07,520 --> 09:02:09,240
I ulted so much!

9215
09:02:12,240 --> 09:02:13,920
Oh my god!

9216
09:02:14,060 --> 09:02:18,520
I used my ult to save them so many times and they don't even realize.

9217
09:02:19,540 --> 09:02:21,820
You guys have no aura, no presence.

9218
09:02:22,120 --> 09:02:23,240
It's not the support's fault.

9219
09:02:24,920 --> 09:02:26,820
I can't tell if it's actually their fault or not.

9220
09:02:27,120 --> 09:02:28,020
It's just the troll's.

9221
09:02:28,740 --> 09:02:30,220
Bro, like, what?!

9222
09:02:32,220 --> 09:02:32,740
Please...

9223
09:02:32,740 --> 09:02:35,340
How is it my fault?!

9224
09:02:35,340 --> 09:02:36,860
Wait, bro, you guys are not taking the trade.

9225
09:02:42,770 --> 09:02:48,750
Oh, just because I didn't have ult for like all the fucking aggressive ults.

9226
09:02:50,010 --> 09:02:50,750
Was that RIP?

9227
09:02:51,030 --> 09:02:52,330
Oh, RIP isn't safe.

9228
09:02:56,070 --> 09:02:56,590
What?!

9229
09:02:56,590 --> 09:03:00,810
How the fuck is it my fault?!

9230
09:03:00,810 --> 09:03:12,610
How the fuck is it my fault?!

9231
09:03:12,610 --> 09:03:14,190
How the fuck?!

9232
09:03:14,190 --> 09:03:16,590
How the fuck is it my fault?!

9233
09:03:19,050 --> 09:03:20,510
Literally, like...

9234
09:03:20,510 --> 09:03:22,730
All I did...

9235
09:03:22,730 --> 09:03:24,810
I can't believe it.

9236
09:03:24,810 --> 09:03:30,170
I literally Luna ulted every aggressive ult I see.

9237
09:03:30,690 --> 09:03:34,890
But, like, the one time I didn't have a Luna ult.

9238
09:03:35,750 --> 09:03:36,550
Like...

9239
09:03:36,550 --> 09:03:41,470
The one time I didn't have a Luna ult.

9240
09:03:42,050 --> 09:03:43,230
Oh my god.

9241
09:03:58,670 --> 09:03:59,850
Oh my god.

9242
09:03:59,850 --> 09:04:00,270
Holy shit.

9243
09:04:01,010 --> 09:04:03,230
If I have ult every fucking...

9244
09:04:03,230 --> 09:04:04,110
Oh, I'm sorry.

9245
09:04:04,250 --> 09:04:08,230
Let me have ult for five different aggressive aggression ults.

9246
09:04:11,170 --> 09:04:11,970
Like...

9247
09:04:12,770 --> 09:04:13,970
Why is...

9248
09:04:13,970 --> 09:04:16,510
Why does my ult have a fucking cooldown?

9249
09:04:16,930 --> 09:04:18,530
Good fucking question.

9250
09:04:19,130 --> 09:04:19,730
Why...

9251
09:04:19,730 --> 09:04:24,690
Oh my god.

9252
09:04:24,690 --> 09:04:26,490
Oh my god.

9253
09:04:36,230 --> 09:04:36,910
Yeah,

9254
09:04:48,250 --> 09:04:50,990
why did I decide to have, like...

9255
09:04:50,990 --> 09:04:56,970
If only I could, like, fucking Luna ult every, like, fucking...

9256
09:04:58,170 --> 09:04:58,730
Every...

9257
09:04:58,730 --> 09:05:00,510
fucking three...

9258
09:05:00,510 --> 09:05:02,310
Oh my god, I can't even word anymore.

9259
09:05:02,430 --> 09:05:04,370
This guy actually tilted me so hard.

9260
09:05:04,710 --> 09:05:06,370
Like, legitimately?

9261
09:05:06,870 --> 09:05:07,670
That guy?

9262
09:05:07,770 --> 09:05:08,710
That was like...

9263
09:05:08,710 --> 09:05:11,090
Why don't you... Have we never had a Luna ult?

9264
09:05:11,170 --> 09:05:12,910
That guy actually tilted me so hard.

9265
09:05:13,370 --> 09:05:15,870
Like, I've never been that tilted before.

9266
09:05:16,650 --> 09:05:19,430
I've actually never been that tilted before.

9267
09:05:20,350 --> 09:05:22,370
That shit, like, actually fucked me up.

9268
09:05:26,030 --> 09:05:28,350
Every Luna ult I did was an aggression.

9269
09:05:28,430 --> 09:05:29,730
Like, was a defensive ult.

9270
09:05:29,970 --> 09:05:30,990
Like, holy fuck.

9271
09:05:43,860 --> 09:05:45,320
That guy belongs in plat.

9272
09:05:45,420 --> 09:05:46,940
Yeah, I hope he never gets top 500.

9273
09:05:47,180 --> 09:05:47,900
Holy fuck.

9274
09:05:48,320 --> 09:05:49,460
I can get this whenever.

9275
09:05:49,960 --> 09:05:50,920
I just want it fast.

9276
09:05:51,140 --> 09:05:53,460
That's the only reason why I'm trying to get it now.

9277
09:05:58,220 --> 09:05:59,580
You have to have a spider weapon.

9278
09:06:07,140 --> 09:06:08,200
Bro, please.

9279
09:06:08,420 --> 09:06:09,240
Please help.

9280
09:06:09,620 --> 09:06:10,780
Please help him.

9281
09:06:14,260 --> 09:06:15,620
Please help him.

9282
09:06:16,420 --> 09:06:17,540
Please help him.

9283
09:06:19,060 --> 09:06:20,180
Oh my god.

9284
09:06:20,280 --> 09:06:21,100
Please help him.

9285
09:06:21,720 --> 09:06:22,960
I can't help him anymore.

9286
09:06:23,100 --> 09:06:23,800
I can't.

9287
09:06:26,520 --> 09:06:28,300
This is my circus.

9288
09:06:29,620 --> 09:06:31,080
This is my circus.

9289
09:06:31,280 --> 09:06:31,780
I can't.

9290
09:06:31,780 --> 09:06:36,320
I literally pocketed this guy so hard.

9291
09:06:40,030 --> 09:06:41,050
No, I have.

9292
09:06:41,150 --> 09:06:42,090
I'm fucking going crazy.

9293
09:06:43,970 --> 09:06:45,510
Oh my god.

9294
09:06:45,610 --> 09:06:45,890
Okay.

9295
09:06:46,170 --> 09:06:48,190
I don't think we fight that anymore.

9296
09:06:51,150 --> 09:06:52,150
Magneto, please.

9297
09:06:53,330 --> 09:06:54,350
Magneto, please.

9298
09:06:59,330 --> 09:06:59,910
Please.

9299
09:07:06,510 --> 09:07:07,910
Please.

9300
09:07:07,910 --> 09:07:08,250
Oh my god.

9301
09:07:09,590 --> 09:07:16,490
Oh my god.

9302
09:07:19,370 --> 09:07:20,770
Yay!

9303
09:07:25,250 --> 09:07:27,790
We're gonna do this.

9304
09:07:37,190 --> 09:07:38,410
Oh my god.

9305
09:07:38,510 --> 09:07:39,250
Not him again.

9306
09:07:40,550 --> 09:07:47,590
I'm just trying to make sure our fucking Magneto doesn't fucking die because he's not having it right now.

9307
09:07:48,510 --> 09:07:50,150
He really isn't.

9308
09:07:52,890 --> 09:07:54,050
He's not having it.

9309
09:07:54,090 --> 09:07:54,450
Bro.

9310
09:07:55,250 --> 09:07:56,550
Jesus Christ.

9311
09:07:57,670 --> 09:07:57,930
Nice.

9312
09:08:00,170 --> 09:08:01,690
I almost died to that.

9313
09:08:11,080 --> 09:08:12,560
Oh my god.

9314
09:08:12,620 --> 09:08:14,040
Oh my god.

9315
09:08:14,040 --> 09:08:15,820
I don't know what you want from me.

9316
09:08:15,940 --> 09:08:16,540
I don't.

9317
09:08:17,140 --> 09:08:18,200
I'm dead.

9318
09:08:30,280 --> 09:08:31,280
Surefour, please.

9319
09:08:31,280 --> 09:08:33,500
Surefour, I'm suffering right now.

9320
09:08:33,960 --> 09:08:35,140
Oh my god.

9321
09:08:35,260 --> 09:08:38,040
Surefour, I'm suffering right now.

9322
09:08:38,600 --> 09:08:41,200
I brought Esky down into my fucking hell.

9323
09:08:42,460 --> 09:08:45,360
She's never experienced my lobbies before.

9324
09:08:46,340 --> 09:08:49,360
She's actually never been this tilted before because of...

9325
09:08:51,140 --> 09:08:53,460
She's never been this tilted before.

9326
09:08:53,980 --> 09:08:56,780
She's never had to go through what I went through.

9327
09:08:59,560 --> 09:09:00,160
Surefour.

9328
09:09:00,460 --> 09:09:01,060
Surefour.

9329
09:09:01,060 --> 09:09:04,620
If you didn't stop, we would've avoided all of this.

9330
09:09:04,780 --> 09:09:09,180
If you stayed for one more hour, we could've avoided all of this.

9331
09:09:18,560 --> 09:09:19,340
Surefour, come on.

9332
09:09:19,400 --> 09:09:20,060
Get over here.

9333
09:09:20,140 --> 09:09:21,280
You know you want to.

9334
09:09:21,920 --> 09:09:23,960
You know you wanna be here.

9335
09:09:28,080 --> 09:09:29,040
Come on.

9336
09:09:29,040 --> 09:09:30,020
Come on.

9337
09:09:30,080 --> 09:09:30,860
It's a party.

9338
09:09:31,460 --> 09:09:33,440
You know you want to.

9339
09:09:34,360 --> 09:09:36,560
You wanna join this party, don't you?

9340
09:09:37,160 --> 09:09:39,600
This is peak hours right here.

9341
09:09:40,280 --> 09:09:41,820
Peak gaming hours.

9342
09:09:52,340 --> 09:09:54,260
What the fuck?

9343
09:09:56,480 --> 09:09:57,540
Okay, I got him.

9344
09:09:57,600 --> 09:09:57,860
I got him.

9345
09:09:57,960 --> 09:09:58,160
I got him.

9346
09:09:58,180 --> 09:09:58,960
Oh, I...

9347
09:10:00,260 --> 09:10:01,820
Oh my god.

9348
09:10:01,940 --> 09:10:03,800
Oh my god.

9349
09:10:04,660 --> 09:10:05,740
Oh my god.

9350
09:10:05,740 --> 09:10:06,940
Jesus Christ.

9351
09:10:07,500 --> 09:10:08,520
Are you guys okay?

9352
09:10:08,720 --> 09:10:09,700
I don't think they're okay.

9353
09:10:12,750 --> 09:10:13,140
Okay.

9354
09:10:13,940 --> 09:10:14,260
Alright.

9355
09:10:15,900 --> 09:10:17,460
Jesus Christ.

9356
09:10:17,860 --> 09:10:20,140
What's going on in my lobby?

9357
09:10:29,200 --> 09:10:31,600
Like, what's going on?

9358
09:10:35,900 --> 09:10:37,100
Good shit.

9359
09:10:46,660 --> 09:10:47,460
Please.

9360
09:10:47,860 --> 09:10:48,320
Please.

9361
09:10:48,540 --> 09:10:49,140
Oh my god.

9362
09:10:49,240 --> 09:10:50,620
He's literally one.

9363
09:10:50,620 --> 09:10:53,340
I think I got a headshot.

9364
09:10:54,140 --> 09:10:55,080
Oh, nevermind.

9365
09:10:55,180 --> 09:10:55,380
That's good.

9366
09:11:05,440 --> 09:11:07,000
There we go.

9367
09:11:08,160 --> 09:11:08,900
I'm still here.

9368
09:11:09,900 --> 09:11:11,660
I'm still here, guys.

9369
09:11:14,120 --> 09:11:15,500
I'm still here.

9370
09:11:15,500 --> 09:11:15,540
I'm still here.

9371
09:11:18,320 --> 09:11:19,940
I'm not going in there.

9372
09:11:20,120 --> 09:11:21,380
I don't want him to gen me.

9373
09:11:22,900 --> 09:11:26,080
Okay, now the goal is to get plat one back.

9374
09:11:27,360 --> 09:11:27,920
Bro!

9375
09:11:29,120 --> 09:11:31,260
Like, holy shit!

9376
09:11:31,880 --> 09:11:33,480
Bro, I can't outheal all that!

9377
09:11:35,640 --> 09:11:37,420
That's way too much!

9378
09:11:42,590 --> 09:11:44,650
There was no way I could heal all that.

9379
09:11:45,410 --> 09:11:48,270
I'm sorry, SK, that brought you to my circus.

9380
09:11:50,170 --> 09:11:51,470
I'm sorry.

9381
09:11:52,470 --> 09:11:54,370
I'm sorry I had to be in the circus.

9382
09:12:05,960 --> 09:12:10,240
You gotta save your fucking KD?

9383
09:12:11,180 --> 09:12:11,920
I...

9384
09:12:11,920 --> 09:12:13,500
Oh my god!

9385
09:12:13,500 --> 09:12:16,860
Oh my god!

9386
09:12:17,140 --> 09:12:20,520
I gotta save my fucking KD?

9387
09:12:20,940 --> 09:12:23,380
Did I heard that correctly?

9388
09:12:28,470 --> 09:12:30,970
Oh my god.

9389
09:12:32,650 --> 09:12:33,750
Surefour, get in here, Surefour.

9390
09:12:33,830 --> 09:12:35,450
I'm gonna fucking spam you on Discord.

9391
09:12:53,550 --> 09:12:55,870
What do you say?

9392
09:12:58,150 --> 09:13:00,290
What do you say?

9393
09:13:00,770 --> 09:13:02,010
What do you say?

9394
09:13:02,010 --> 09:13:03,830
Oh my god.

9395
09:13:11,620 --> 09:13:13,980
Oh my god!

9396
09:13:14,100 --> 09:13:15,220
Yo, fuck you!

9397
09:13:16,260 --> 09:13:17,200
Actually!

9398
09:13:17,900 --> 09:13:18,940
Oh my god!

9399
09:13:22,120 --> 09:13:25,360
I did not say it was nothing, Surefour.

9400
09:13:25,480 --> 09:13:30,380
I said you can't compare, cause you haven't gone through Marvel Rivals, babe.

9401
09:13:31,180 --> 09:13:35,580
You haven't gone, you can't Q snipe, you're in Diamond!

9402
09:13:36,400 --> 09:13:39,140
You fucking idiot, you can't Q snipe!

9403
09:13:39,420 --> 09:13:43,540
We're getting plat lobbies, you have to be in plat!

9404
09:13:44,200 --> 09:13:45,520
You fucking idiot!

9405
09:13:46,680 --> 09:13:47,680
Get in here.

9406
09:13:50,320 --> 09:13:50,840
Oh my god.

9407
09:13:50,840 --> 09:13:50,840
Bro!

9408
09:13:51,040 --> 09:13:51,880
Oh my god!

9409
09:13:51,940 --> 09:13:53,080
Did we not avoid?

9410
09:13:53,720 --> 09:13:56,340
Oh my god, we should have avoided one!

9411
09:13:57,820 --> 09:13:59,280
Oh my god.

9412
09:14:00,140 --> 09:14:02,020
Oh my... no, bro, I give up.

9413
09:14:02,240 --> 09:14:02,900
Fuck you, okay.

9414
09:14:03,620 --> 09:14:05,780
Let's run three supports, let's go.

9415
09:14:06,180 --> 09:14:06,700
Actually, yeah.

9416
09:14:07,100 --> 09:14:10,620
Oh my god.

9417
09:14:11,760 --> 09:14:13,660
Okay, we gotta avoid one of them.

9418
09:14:13,920 --> 09:14:15,820
We gotta avoid one of them.

9419
09:14:16,740 --> 09:14:17,920
One of them.

9420
09:14:18,220 --> 09:14:19,420
I used up all my...

9421
09:14:19,420 --> 09:14:22,060
all my avoid slots.

9422
09:14:30,500 --> 09:14:31,220
Okay.

9423
09:14:32,260 --> 09:14:33,280
Fuck it.

9424
09:14:35,220 --> 09:14:37,080
Alright, we made a deal.

9425
09:14:37,780 --> 09:14:40,820
Surefour will join, but he gets to play Wolverine.

9426
09:14:40,820 --> 09:14:40,880
I'm...

9427
09:14:45,400 --> 09:14:46,480
That's fine.

9428
09:14:47,540 --> 09:14:49,140
That's fucking fine.

9429
09:14:52,560 --> 09:14:54,480
I'm okay with that compromise.

9430
09:14:55,420 --> 09:14:56,220
Oh my god.

9431
09:14:59,260 --> 09:14:59,780
I'm okay.

9432
09:15:02,980 --> 09:15:04,440
I'm okay with that.

9433
09:15:05,900 --> 09:15:07,120
I'm okay with that.

9434
09:15:07,180 --> 09:15:08,520
No, Surefour, you said it.

9435
09:15:08,520 --> 09:15:08,980
Get on.

9436
09:15:09,560 --> 09:15:14,300
I'm gonna tell SK to be part of the circus.

9437
09:15:14,600 --> 09:15:15,700
I don't care anymore.

9438
09:15:21,740 --> 09:15:23,180
Playing Overwatch, guys.

9439
09:15:23,280 --> 09:15:23,580
It's okay.

9440
09:15:24,100 --> 09:15:24,620
We got this.

9441
09:15:25,900 --> 09:15:26,580
It's fine.

9442
09:15:29,980 --> 09:15:31,340
Is the team of Ashley good?

9443
09:15:43,550 --> 09:15:44,470
Am I healing?

9444
09:15:44,830 --> 09:15:45,710
I can't tell.

9445
09:15:48,670 --> 09:15:51,890
I can't tell if it's doing anything.

9446
09:15:57,120 --> 09:15:57,760
No!

9447
09:15:58,080 --> 09:15:59,340
Oh, it got cancelled.

9448
09:15:59,740 --> 09:16:00,160
Nice.

9449
09:16:00,660 --> 09:16:00,960
Alright.

9450
09:16:01,640 --> 09:16:02,800
Don't Q yet.

9451
09:16:04,960 --> 09:16:06,160
Don't Q yet.

9452
09:16:10,480 --> 09:16:11,380
Don't Q.

9453
09:16:11,520 --> 09:16:12,160
Don't Q.

9454
09:16:12,320 --> 09:16:12,640
Wait.

9455
09:16:13,140 --> 09:16:13,540
Alright.

9456
09:16:14,120 --> 09:16:14,520
Alright.

9457
09:16:14,880 --> 09:16:15,360
Come on.

9458
09:16:15,520 --> 09:16:15,940
Get in.

9459
09:16:17,200 --> 09:16:17,700
Come on.

9460
09:16:17,720 --> 09:16:18,120
I'm waiting.

9461
09:16:23,220 --> 09:16:24,020
Wait.

9462
09:16:24,160 --> 09:16:24,920
The music stopped.

9463
09:16:25,560 --> 09:16:25,760
Wait.

9464
09:16:27,000 --> 09:16:27,700
Hello?

9465
09:16:29,060 --> 09:16:29,580
Hello?

9466
09:16:30,500 --> 09:16:30,840
Hello?

9467
09:16:35,920 --> 09:16:36,700
You're suffering.

9468
09:16:37,280 --> 09:16:37,660
Yeah?

9469
09:16:38,160 --> 09:16:39,920
Come on.

9470
09:16:40,000 --> 09:16:40,500
Let's go.

9471
09:16:41,060 --> 09:16:42,360
Where's the self-harm tag?

9472
09:16:50,410 --> 09:16:51,610
Come on.

9473
09:16:51,850 --> 09:16:53,530
I'm already in too deep.

9474
09:16:53,530 --> 09:16:54,470
Might as well.

9475
09:16:54,710 --> 09:16:56,950
I want you to play Wolverine.

9476
09:16:59,050 --> 09:17:00,410
I might as well.

9477
09:17:00,550 --> 09:17:02,610
At least you have hands.

9478
09:17:03,230 --> 09:17:04,270
You on Wolverine...

9479
09:17:04,270 --> 09:17:12,290
You on Wolverine is better than 80% of the players I just got in the last three hours.

9480
09:17:12,650 --> 09:17:14,070
Hawkeye isn't even enough.

9481
09:17:22,070 --> 09:17:23,090
It's okay.

9482
09:17:23,870 --> 09:17:24,850
It's alright.

9483
09:17:25,230 --> 09:17:27,750
We're all just gonna suffer together.

9484
09:17:29,410 --> 09:17:31,770
You are not picking Luna!

9485
09:17:32,810 --> 09:17:35,010
You're not fucking picking Luna!

9486
09:17:35,370 --> 09:17:35,890
Surefire!

9487
09:17:36,730 --> 09:17:37,690
We agreed!

9488
09:17:38,950 --> 09:17:41,790
We agreed on this!

9489
09:17:42,170 --> 09:17:44,310
You're not picking Luna!

9490
09:17:45,330 --> 09:17:47,850
I literally went through eight hours of Oh my god.

9491
09:17:47,890 --> 09:17:48,610
It's been nine hours.

9492
09:17:49,030 --> 09:17:52,830
I've been playing I've been playing nine hours.

9493
09:17:53,350 --> 09:17:54,670
You're not picking Luna.

9494
09:17:54,770 --> 09:17:57,750
There's no fucking way you're picking Luna.

9495
09:17:57,890 --> 09:17:59,910
There's no fucking way.

9496
09:18:00,650 --> 09:18:04,730
Oh my god.

9497
09:18:05,030 --> 09:18:05,830
There's no way.

9498
09:18:05,930 --> 09:18:07,530
We're suffering together.

9499
09:18:07,790 --> 09:18:08,050
Alright.

9500
09:18:08,510 --> 09:18:10,230
I'm getting SK in this VC.

9501
09:18:12,210 --> 09:18:13,310
I'm getting SK in here.

9502
09:18:13,650 --> 09:18:18,570
To maintain a fair gaming environment and verify misconduct, voice chats are subject to recording.

9503
09:18:21,230 --> 09:18:23,030
Creating a group chat.

9504
09:18:25,890 --> 09:18:26,530
Okay.

9505
09:18:26,970 --> 09:18:28,730
He's not picking Luna!

9506
09:18:29,670 --> 09:18:30,430
I'm picking Luna.

9507
09:18:30,550 --> 09:18:31,630
He is not.

9508
09:18:32,410 --> 09:18:34,290
I'm the Luna now.

9509
09:18:35,030 --> 09:18:35,550
Guys.

9510
09:18:36,590 --> 09:18:38,030
SK, how are you enjoying the circus?

9511
09:18:39,470 --> 09:18:41,470
What the fuck is happening?

9512
09:18:41,730 --> 09:18:43,850
How much do you value your rank right now?

9513
09:18:43,850 --> 09:18:47,370
It's already chopped.

9514
09:18:47,910 --> 09:18:49,530
I didn't answer the question.

9515
09:18:49,910 --> 09:18:50,650
Zero.

9516
09:18:51,580 --> 09:18:52,870
I'm picking Wolverine.

9517
09:18:54,450 --> 09:18:59,870
You on Wolverine is better than every single person we've gotten so far.

9518
09:19:00,110 --> 09:19:04,730
I've never had lobbies this bad in my life.

9519
09:19:05,070 --> 09:19:06,070
You don't know pain.

9520
09:19:07,730 --> 09:19:10,250
This is like oh my

9521
09:19:13,850 --> 09:19:14,650
You gotta carry.

9522
09:19:15,170 --> 09:19:17,850
I am carrying, that's the crazy part.

9523
09:19:18,230 --> 09:19:20,690
If you're losing, then you're not carrying, right?

9524
09:19:20,870 --> 09:19:21,730
Not hard enough.

9525
09:19:22,470 --> 09:19:25,830
You have to carry the world on your back.

9526
09:19:27,950 --> 09:19:29,670
I'm 1v3 in DPS.

9527
09:19:30,170 --> 09:19:31,210
I don't know what's happening.

9528
09:19:31,350 --> 09:19:32,410
You don't understand.

9529
09:19:33,850 --> 09:19:38,590
We were up 6v4 and everyone was just standing in spawn and I had to yell at them to push.

9530
09:19:39,530 --> 09:19:41,270
These people don't play Overwatch.

9531
09:19:41,270 --> 09:19:42,670
I'm picking Luna.

9532
09:19:43,270 --> 09:19:45,470
You're picking Wolverine.

9533
09:19:46,750 --> 09:19:47,750
You're fine.

9534
09:19:47,890 --> 09:19:48,710
Pick Luna.

9535
09:19:49,290 --> 09:19:49,970
It's fine.

9536
09:19:52,350 --> 09:19:53,990
If you're faster than me.

9537
09:19:56,150 --> 09:20:03,510
We were losing so hard and then finally when we had a chance to win, our Dr. Strange got stuck under the map and we were 5v6.

9538
09:20:05,750 --> 09:20:07,230
The Curse of Ra worked.

9539
09:20:08,250 --> 09:20:09,970
He literally cursed us.

9540
09:20:09,970 --> 09:20:11,050
You don't know the Curse of Ra?

9541
09:20:12,210 --> 09:20:13,830
I know the Curse of Ra.

9542
09:20:13,930 --> 09:20:15,750
The Curse of Rod.

9543
09:20:15,850 --> 09:20:17,110
He fucking cursed me.

9544
09:20:17,290 --> 09:20:19,450
He was like, I hope you get into loser queue.

9545
09:20:21,970 --> 09:20:22,630
That's right.

9546
09:20:22,970 --> 09:20:25,630
I don't know where she is, bro.

9547
09:20:25,950 --> 09:20:27,510
I don't know where she is, bro.

9548
09:20:27,990 --> 09:20:29,310
Should've been faster.

9549
09:20:29,610 --> 09:20:30,590
I don't know where she is, bro.

9550
09:20:32,350 --> 09:20:33,190
Pick Wolverine.

9551
09:20:33,410 --> 09:20:34,370
Don't be a pussy.

9552
09:20:35,270 --> 09:20:36,110
Play Wolverine.

9553
09:20:36,110 --> 09:20:37,670
You want me to play Wolverine?

9554
09:20:37,810 --> 09:20:38,470
Yeah, do it.

9555
09:20:38,510 --> 09:20:39,830
Don't be a fucking pussy.

9556
09:20:39,850 --> 09:20:41,230
I ain't fucking shit.

9557
09:20:42,630 --> 09:20:43,030
Shit.

9558
09:20:47,970 --> 09:20:51,490
Oh my god, as long as you get flamed and I don't, that's fine with me.

9559
09:20:51,590 --> 09:20:52,650
I don't get flamed.

9560
09:20:52,990 --> 09:20:55,290
You're gonna get flamed because you're gonna be on Wolverine.

9561
09:20:55,390 --> 09:20:58,130
Nah, I hard carried that one game as Wolverine.

9562
09:20:58,650 --> 09:21:00,290
What about the other game?

9563
09:21:02,210 --> 09:21:03,470
You didn't heal me enough.

9564
09:21:03,470 --> 09:21:08,750
Oh, yeah, yeah, this fucking orb that's on you 24-7 is not enough healing.

9565
09:21:09,230 --> 09:21:10,190
It wasn't enough.

9566
09:21:11,930 --> 09:21:13,330
Wait, do we have...

9567
09:21:13,330 --> 09:21:13,870
Oh, wait, we do.

9568
09:21:13,950 --> 09:21:14,690
We have Doctor Strange.

9569
09:21:15,350 --> 09:21:16,170
And we have Tank.

9570
09:21:17,950 --> 09:21:22,650
Guys, now that there's three of us, that means we have nine avoid slots.

9571
09:21:23,390 --> 09:21:24,950
Nah, you two are cooked right now.

9572
09:21:25,110 --> 09:21:25,710
Oh, no.

9573
09:21:26,530 --> 09:21:28,370
You guys are already mentally cooked.

9574
09:21:28,710 --> 09:21:29,730
No, no, I'm not.

9575
09:21:29,830 --> 09:21:30,350
I'm cooking.

9576
09:21:30,470 --> 09:21:31,330
I'm locked in.

9577
09:21:31,330 --> 09:21:32,810
You're locked in?

9578
09:21:32,890 --> 09:21:34,070
I'm so locked in.

9579
09:21:38,320 --> 09:21:39,640
Pick me up, bro.

9580
09:21:39,760 --> 09:21:40,360
Pick me up.

9581
09:21:40,560 --> 09:21:40,840
Yeah.

9582
09:21:42,400 --> 09:21:43,940
Launch me in, motherfucker!

9583
09:21:46,460 --> 09:21:47,740
I'm going in deep!

9584
09:21:52,740 --> 09:21:53,620
That's one!

9585
09:21:54,340 --> 09:21:54,840
That's one!

9586
09:21:55,700 --> 09:21:59,800
You have so much energy for 6am.

9587
09:22:01,740 --> 09:22:03,140
Motherfucker, I drank a coffee.

9588
09:22:03,860 --> 09:22:05,180
Why did you drink coffee?

9589
09:22:08,140 --> 09:22:09,140
Yo, where's my heals?

9590
09:22:09,460 --> 09:22:10,280
Oh, what do you mean?

9591
09:22:10,340 --> 09:22:10,980
You had an orb.

9592
09:22:11,100 --> 09:22:11,900
Where my heals at?

9593
09:22:12,200 --> 09:22:14,720
Where my heals at?

9594
09:22:16,220 --> 09:22:17,680
There's three of me in the back.

9595
09:22:18,580 --> 09:22:19,700
I can't help you, SK.

9596
09:22:20,420 --> 09:22:20,860
I'm sorry.

9597
09:22:21,900 --> 09:22:23,400
Yo, no fucking yeet me.

9598
09:22:23,600 --> 09:22:24,660
Yo, Hulk, come back here.

9599
09:22:26,460 --> 09:22:27,120
Throw me.

9600
09:22:28,280 --> 09:22:29,220
Throw me, motherfucker.

9601
09:22:29,960 --> 09:22:30,520
Throw me.

9602
09:22:30,760 --> 09:22:31,260
Yeet me in.

9603
09:22:31,360 --> 09:22:32,020
Put me in, coach.

9604
09:22:43,750 --> 09:22:44,150
Okay.

9605
09:22:45,110 --> 09:22:46,290
I'm coming back.

9606
09:22:47,330 --> 09:22:49,610
You're not getting heals if you're so far.

9607
09:22:49,750 --> 09:22:50,430
You're not getting heals.

9608
09:22:51,370 --> 09:22:51,690
Heal me.

9609
09:22:51,990 --> 09:22:53,190
Get closer, SK.

9610
09:22:53,230 --> 09:22:53,830
Give me the orb.

9611
09:22:55,610 --> 09:22:56,710
I need a healing.

9612
09:22:57,330 --> 09:22:58,010
Alright, we're fine.

9613
09:23:00,850 --> 09:23:01,950
This is the circus.

9614
09:23:07,150 --> 09:23:07,970
I love the circus.

9615
09:23:08,550 --> 09:23:09,350
I'm in the back line.

9616
09:23:13,810 --> 09:23:15,030
Oh, they're chasing you.

9617
09:23:15,290 --> 09:23:17,250
They are chasing you.

9618
09:23:18,830 --> 09:23:20,070
That is not my fault.

9619
09:23:21,090 --> 09:23:22,370
I needed healing there.

9620
09:23:22,570 --> 09:23:23,390
That is not my fault.

9621
09:23:24,530 --> 09:23:26,270
I gave you so much healing.

9622
09:23:27,070 --> 09:23:28,810
That could be possible.

9623
09:23:30,890 --> 09:23:32,710
Oh my god, they're gonna...

9624
09:23:33,390 --> 09:23:38,030
They're gonna use the eye of something and then we're gonna be fucked.

9625
09:23:38,750 --> 09:23:39,710
There we go.

9626
09:23:40,270 --> 09:23:41,030
I called it.

9627
09:23:46,310 --> 09:23:47,850
Putting a show.

9628
09:23:55,020 --> 09:23:57,740
You're getting as much heals as I can give you.

9629
09:23:58,080 --> 09:23:58,760
I'm surviving.

9630
09:23:59,220 --> 09:23:59,780
I'm not.

9631
09:24:04,720 --> 09:24:06,540
Don't worry, I almost have bonkai.

9632
09:24:07,800 --> 09:24:08,880
Wait, just...

9633
09:24:08,880 --> 09:24:10,100
Isn't this your first ult?

9634
09:24:11,380 --> 09:24:11,920
Yeah.

9635
09:24:14,140 --> 09:24:14,520
Okay.

9636
09:24:16,600 --> 09:24:18,460
We have two fights left.

9637
09:24:23,380 --> 09:24:24,240
You know what?

9638
09:24:24,280 --> 09:24:25,800
I hope we de-rank sure for two.

9639
09:24:27,080 --> 09:24:28,100
So I can get it back.

9640
09:24:28,780 --> 09:24:29,320
Oh,

9641
09:24:37,650 --> 09:24:39,090
that is not good.

9642
09:24:40,250 --> 09:24:41,410
I got an ult out.

9643
09:24:41,410 --> 09:24:42,290
I got an ult out.

9644
09:24:42,630 --> 09:24:43,610
I got an ult out.

9645
09:24:44,370 --> 09:24:47,190
Wait, did you not ult?

9646
09:24:48,390 --> 09:24:49,370
Oh my gosh.

9647
09:24:50,730 --> 09:24:51,990
What happened?

9648
09:24:52,770 --> 09:24:53,530
Everyone's died.

9649
09:24:57,880 --> 09:25:00,040
The other team is extremely powerful.

9650
09:25:01,080 --> 09:25:01,760
Wait a minute.

9651
09:25:02,000 --> 09:25:03,420
He's gonna crash out.

9652
09:25:04,040 --> 09:25:06,540
He's gonna...

9653
09:25:06,540 --> 09:25:08,480
I think...

9654
09:25:08,480 --> 09:25:08,980
Oh!

9655
09:25:13,060 --> 09:25:14,820
The Hawkeye swap.

9656
09:25:15,960 --> 09:25:18,720
I have to go bonkai mode.

9657
09:25:19,180 --> 09:25:19,860
You have to.

9658
09:25:21,920 --> 09:25:25,120
This time, we gotta fucking go in though soon.

9659
09:25:28,560 --> 09:25:29,640
Oh, that was one.

9660
09:25:36,340 --> 09:25:38,100
But you'll be fine, right?

9661
09:25:38,960 --> 09:25:40,280
Here, now hit this guy.

9662
09:25:42,380 --> 09:25:43,840
Oh my god.

9663
09:25:43,840 --> 09:25:45,400
I got it.

9664
09:25:47,620 --> 09:25:49,260
The eye is here.

9665
09:25:52,920 --> 09:25:58,280
Guys, I think Wolverine is a bad character.

9666
09:26:03,060 --> 09:26:04,720
I need healing.

9667
09:26:06,260 --> 09:26:07,120
Oh my god.

9668
09:26:07,880 --> 09:26:08,600
You're fine.

9669
09:26:09,740 --> 09:26:10,640
Who would have thought?

9670
09:26:10,640 --> 09:26:12,140
Wolverine is just...

9671
09:26:12,140 --> 09:26:13,480
It's not a good character.

9672
09:26:14,520 --> 09:26:17,180
You're lucky I like winning more than trolling.

9673
09:26:20,900 --> 09:26:23,600
I wouldn't have any other way to show for it.

9674
09:26:26,520 --> 09:26:27,700
My winner's spirit took over.

9675
09:26:27,700 --> 09:26:30,690
I can't believe the only Canadian character is the worst DPS.

9676
09:26:32,080 --> 09:26:32,760
He's Canadian?

9677
09:26:33,060 --> 09:26:34,200
Yes, he's Canadian!

9678
09:26:34,820 --> 09:26:35,860
You're Canadian!

9679
09:26:36,120 --> 09:26:38,740
I don't know anything about fucking superheroes, bro.

9680
09:26:38,740 --> 09:26:39,740
You're Canadian!

9681
09:26:40,900 --> 09:26:43,420
Okay, that doesn't mean I know every Canadian in existence.

9682
09:26:43,420 --> 09:26:45,420
You should know every famous Canadian as a Canadian.

9683
09:26:45,660 --> 09:26:46,240
Yeah, I know.

9684
09:26:50,110 --> 09:26:51,090
Alright, goodbye.

9685
09:26:52,610 --> 09:26:53,470
Oh my god.

9686
09:26:53,610 --> 09:26:55,090
I guess I die?

9687
09:27:00,500 --> 09:27:01,280
Blank kite!

9688
09:27:02,680 --> 09:27:03,400
Aimbot arrow.

9689
09:27:04,200 --> 09:27:04,860
We're dead.

9690
09:27:05,200 --> 09:27:06,300
We're all dead.

9691
09:27:07,740 --> 09:27:08,100
And you're dead too.

9692
09:27:08,100 --> 09:27:09,080
Why is he dead?

9693
09:27:09,080 --> 09:27:12,400
You literally ulted when we all died.

9694
09:27:12,860 --> 09:27:13,820
Ice shooting arrow!

9695
09:27:14,540 --> 09:27:15,440
And team dying.

9696
09:27:16,760 --> 09:27:17,460
Ah, she-bear.

9697
09:27:18,000 --> 09:27:18,380
Okay.

9698
09:27:19,180 --> 09:27:20,640
I'm not cut out for this life.

9699
09:27:20,880 --> 09:27:21,600
The hella life.

9700
09:27:22,000 --> 09:27:23,920
What are you on hella?

9701
09:27:25,200 --> 09:27:25,840
I don't know.

9702
09:27:27,040 --> 09:27:27,880
I'm desperate.

9703
09:27:28,060 --> 09:27:28,940
You're a meta slave.

9704
09:27:30,540 --> 09:27:32,780
You're a meta slave, but yet you don't play hella.

9705
09:27:33,180 --> 09:27:34,940
Play magic, don't be a coward.

9706
09:27:35,920 --> 09:27:37,060
Magic is ass.

9707
09:27:37,060 --> 09:27:37,080
Alright.

9708
09:27:41,440 --> 09:27:43,060
Oh my god.

9709
09:27:43,180 --> 09:27:44,320
I'm scared now.

9710
09:27:45,260 --> 09:27:46,780
I'm scared now.

9711
09:27:49,140 --> 09:27:50,740
I-oh my god.

9712
09:27:50,800 --> 09:27:52,120
I just needed one little touch.

9713
09:27:52,680 --> 09:27:53,160
Of heals.

9714
09:27:54,380 --> 09:27:56,380
That's okay, we have like two more fights.

9715
09:28:05,450 --> 09:28:07,250
We have one fight left.

9716
09:28:11,250 --> 09:28:12,050
What the fuck?

9717
09:28:13,150 --> 09:28:15,210
Fucking, our Magneto is fucking crazy.

9718
09:28:16,990 --> 09:28:18,390
He got a kill though.

9719
09:28:22,160 --> 09:28:23,160
I have ult here.

9720
09:28:23,740 --> 09:28:26,660
I'm gonna wait until I hear the I of whatever.

9721
09:28:27,660 --> 09:28:29,180
Okay, nevermind, I'll do it here.

9722
09:28:29,340 --> 09:28:29,580
Oh my god.

9723
09:28:29,580 --> 09:28:32,560
Oh my god.

9724
09:28:32,600 --> 09:28:33,020
Oh my god, you guys.

9725
09:28:33,380 --> 09:28:34,400
He's gonna use the I.

9726
09:28:35,020 --> 09:28:35,960
For the last fight.

9727
09:28:38,620 --> 09:28:39,700
There it is.

9728
09:28:40,160 --> 09:28:41,600
There it is.

9729
09:28:41,600 --> 09:28:42,960
There it is.

9730
09:28:43,920 --> 09:28:45,580
Who would've thought he was gonna use it.

9731
09:28:48,400 --> 09:28:49,640
Wow, he did it.

9732
09:28:50,480 --> 09:28:51,160
Let's change this one.

9733
09:28:53,720 --> 09:28:54,580
I'm gonna reload.

9734
09:28:59,410 --> 09:29:00,390
It's winnable.

9735
09:29:00,390 --> 09:29:01,910
Please, someone kill this Loki.

9736
09:29:01,990 --> 09:29:03,210
That's right here.

9737
09:29:05,450 --> 09:29:07,630
Oh no, it's not anymore.

9738
09:29:12,810 --> 09:29:13,310
Unless...

9739
09:29:13,310 --> 09:29:15,550
Why am I deflecting not working?

9740
09:29:16,730 --> 09:29:17,850
Why am I deflecting not working?

9741
09:29:20,310 --> 09:29:21,390
Not another I.

9742
09:29:22,270 --> 09:29:23,370
How did he do that again?

9743
09:29:25,630 --> 09:29:28,650
Alright guys, we can defend this, right?

9744
09:29:30,630 --> 09:29:31,710
Yeah, yeah.

9745
09:29:32,130 --> 09:29:32,470
Nah.

9746
09:29:37,010 --> 09:29:38,030
It's okay.

9747
09:29:38,830 --> 09:29:39,850
Back to Wolverine.

9748
09:29:40,810 --> 09:29:43,730
You're gonna make Fabian man fucking cry.

9749
09:29:44,550 --> 09:29:48,190
Yeah, but if he crashes out, it's funny.

9750
09:29:48,790 --> 09:29:54,930
He's like asking if someone else I don't get it.

9751
09:29:54,990 --> 09:29:56,750
Like, I don't know what that even means.

9752
09:29:57,190 --> 09:29:59,230
Like, what does that even mean?

9753
09:30:02,910 --> 09:30:04,750
Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.

9754
09:30:10,070 --> 09:30:11,130
It's fine.

9755
09:30:12,190 --> 09:30:14,890
My girlfriend says she loves you, Doki Bird.

9756
09:30:15,450 --> 09:30:21,590
This is an escape, by the way.

9757
09:30:24,230 --> 09:30:25,910
Best fucking life.

9758
09:30:27,510 --> 09:30:29,790
They're like saying there's no way that's it.

9759
09:30:30,710 --> 09:30:32,330
Look up there, Vaan.

9760
09:30:32,470 --> 09:30:33,430
Not there.

9761
09:30:33,430 --> 09:30:33,610
Yes!

9762
09:30:35,230 --> 09:30:35,550
Bro.

9763
09:30:36,510 --> 09:30:38,650
Don't worry, Lady Sapphire is saving you.

9764
09:30:39,130 --> 09:30:40,910
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

9765
09:30:40,930 --> 09:30:41,970
She's saving you.

9766
09:30:46,210 --> 09:30:48,470
Your reputation is safe, SK.

9767
09:30:48,810 --> 09:30:51,730
It's only my reputation that's getting dragged.

9768
09:30:51,910 --> 09:30:55,930
No, I'm 10-4.

9769
09:30:56,330 --> 09:30:56,850
I'm juicing.

9770
09:30:57,310 --> 09:30:58,190
I'm the ace.

9771
09:30:58,550 --> 09:30:59,050
I'm the ace.

9772
09:30:59,570 --> 09:31:00,450
I'm the ace.

9773
09:31:04,550 --> 09:31:07,430
There's no loose streak that can ever affect me.

9774
09:31:07,850 --> 09:31:08,310
Ever.

9775
09:31:09,350 --> 09:31:12,650
I've been through the pits of hell and back.

9776
09:31:18,110 --> 09:31:21,210
I stared into the abyss and I crawled out.

9777
09:31:22,210 --> 09:31:22,910
Yeah, they are.

9778
09:31:23,030 --> 09:31:26,050
I was like, bro, that sounds like something that's gonna fuck us up.

9779
09:31:35,640 --> 09:31:39,220
That's crazy, though, that he was like, that's not...

9780
09:31:44,270 --> 09:31:46,870
What are they doing over there?

9781
09:31:52,680 --> 09:31:54,180
I got you.

9782
09:31:54,680 --> 09:31:55,940
Double K.O.

9783
09:31:58,780 --> 09:32:00,520
Yay, double K.O.

9784
09:32:01,020 --> 09:32:01,240
Yay.

9785
09:32:03,820 --> 09:32:05,520
Wait, there's more people over there?

9786
09:32:05,540 --> 09:32:08,460
It's only a knockout, not a kill, because heroes never die.

9787
09:32:09,900 --> 09:32:12,060
There's a person over there, too.

9788
09:32:15,100 --> 09:32:17,320
Guys, I think we got a touchdown point.

9789
09:32:22,600 --> 09:32:23,780
Oh my god.

9790
09:32:23,920 --> 09:32:25,120
Oh my god.

9791
09:32:25,200 --> 09:32:27,360
What is going on on my screen?

9792
09:32:28,220 --> 09:32:30,620
Why are they able to just run me down?

9793
09:32:32,820 --> 09:32:34,200
I may have died.

9794
09:32:34,380 --> 09:32:35,820
I may have done a little bit of dying.

9795
09:32:35,820 --> 09:32:36,740
Uh oh.

9796
09:32:37,640 --> 09:32:39,620
Oh no, now we have one.

9797
09:32:40,560 --> 09:32:42,600
Oh my god, what?

9798
09:32:44,020 --> 09:32:45,780
Our team's crashing out.

9799
09:32:46,780 --> 09:32:48,500
This shit is over.

9800
09:32:49,820 --> 09:32:50,580
Which...

9801
09:32:50,580 --> 09:32:53,460
Which part caused the crash?

9802
09:32:53,860 --> 09:32:55,200
Surefour on Wolverine?

9803
09:32:55,580 --> 09:32:57,440
Or everything else that happened?

9804
09:32:58,460 --> 09:33:00,780
It's gotta be my hello scoreline.

9805
09:33:05,820 --> 09:33:08,480
Where do you think was his fucking breaking point?

9806
09:33:09,020 --> 09:33:09,540
By the way,

9807
09:33:14,440 --> 09:33:17,560
I'm just curious where his breaking point was.

9808
09:33:18,800 --> 09:33:20,700
I got the double support ult out.

9809
09:33:21,600 --> 09:33:22,820
What do we do now?

9810
09:33:23,840 --> 09:33:24,780
We have nobody...

9811
09:33:24,780 --> 09:33:26,040
What do we do?

9812
09:33:27,240 --> 09:33:28,380
What do we do?

9813
09:33:28,380 --> 09:33:29,900
I love...

9814
09:33:37,570 --> 09:33:40,650
This is the actual escape.

9815
09:33:41,470 --> 09:33:45,590
Oh my god.

9816
09:33:46,450 --> 09:33:48,070
Oh my god.

9817
09:33:49,650 --> 09:33:50,850
SK, are you enjoying this?

9818
09:33:51,510 --> 09:33:51,970
Yeah.

9819
09:33:53,350 --> 09:33:58,270
Are you happy that I got invited you back into the Marvel?

9820
09:33:58,270 --> 09:34:01,090
I'm really happy I'm up at 6am for this.

9821
09:34:01,450 --> 09:34:02,050
Yeah.

9822
09:34:03,090 --> 09:34:04,910
There's nothing I'd rather be doing.

9823
09:34:07,990 --> 09:34:09,930
Guys, I love...

9824
09:34:09,930 --> 09:34:12,110
I love Marvel Rivals.

9825
09:34:13,730 --> 09:34:14,450
Wolverine.

9826
09:34:15,830 --> 09:34:18,210
Marvel Rivals is so fun, guys.

9827
09:34:21,290 --> 09:34:22,810
Guys, lock the freak in.

9828
09:34:22,930 --> 09:34:24,310
I am locked in!

9829
09:34:24,450 --> 09:34:28,810
I literally have the most healing out of both teams.

9830
09:34:30,510 --> 09:34:31,590
What have you been doing?

9831
09:34:33,090 --> 09:34:35,670
I had like 11 final blows.

9832
09:34:35,670 --> 09:34:37,690
Okay, SK, what about you?

9833
09:34:39,390 --> 09:34:41,270
I'm locked in.

9834
09:34:41,290 --> 09:34:42,070
You're locked in?

9835
09:34:42,230 --> 09:34:45,270
You guys better be locked in, guys.

9836
09:34:49,030 --> 09:34:50,870
Give us Wolverine.

9837
09:34:52,190 --> 09:34:53,870
Unless you're a fucking pussy.

9838
09:34:55,530 --> 09:34:56,770
I am what I eat.

9839
09:34:58,930 --> 09:34:59,930
Which is?

9840
09:35:01,370 --> 09:35:01,690
Pussy.

9841
09:35:10,430 --> 09:35:11,530
This is fine.

9842
09:35:11,790 --> 09:35:13,310
This is so fine.

9843
09:35:17,210 --> 09:35:18,650
It's awesome time.

9844
09:35:19,070 --> 09:35:20,530
I believe in us.

9845
09:35:22,730 --> 09:35:24,210
What can go wrong?

9846
09:35:25,350 --> 09:35:27,130
What could possibly go wrong?

9847
09:35:27,770 --> 09:35:29,230
We only have one healer.

9848
09:35:33,390 --> 09:35:35,990
This is seeming like a problem.

9849
09:35:38,010 --> 09:35:39,430
Guys, it's okay.

9850
09:35:39,430 --> 09:35:42,170
I can heal all of us.

9851
09:35:42,330 --> 09:35:42,770
It's okay.

9852
09:35:42,950 --> 09:35:44,390
I can heal all of us.

9853
09:35:45,650 --> 09:35:48,590
I think maybe we're adding another loss to the board.

9854
09:35:48,970 --> 09:35:52,550
The sooner we win, the sooner I can go to sleep.

9855
09:35:53,430 --> 09:35:54,950
Maybe we're losing the gaming.

9856
09:35:58,190 --> 09:36:01,510
SK, you're gonna leave after one win?

9857
09:36:02,170 --> 09:36:03,050
You're gonna leave?

9858
09:36:03,630 --> 09:36:05,670
You're gonna leave after one win?

9859
09:36:05,730 --> 09:36:08,630
Maybe we get another loss on the board?

9860
09:36:09,050 --> 09:36:12,070
What if we just keep losing so she'll never leave?

9861
09:36:13,550 --> 09:36:14,750
I like losing.

9862
09:36:14,890 --> 09:36:15,830
Very poggers.

9863
09:36:22,930 --> 09:36:25,090
Maybe we're doing a little bit of losing.

9864
09:36:25,170 --> 09:36:26,730
Maybe we do need another healer.

9865
09:36:32,570 --> 09:36:36,170
Guys, I just need to know if I die, it's over.

9866
09:36:37,390 --> 09:36:38,570
Don't freaking die.

9867
09:36:38,650 --> 09:36:39,030
It's easy.

9868
09:36:40,750 --> 09:36:41,390
It's fine.

9869
09:36:41,510 --> 09:36:42,710
They got a fucking Wolverine.

9870
09:36:42,730 --> 09:36:45,410
They got Wolverine and it's so over but he's angry.

9871
09:36:48,910 --> 09:36:49,950
It's so over.

9872
09:36:52,690 --> 09:36:53,510
It's hard.

9873
09:36:53,630 --> 09:36:54,370
They have two healers.

9874
09:36:55,910 --> 09:36:56,950
Two healers?

9875
09:36:57,030 --> 09:36:58,490
How do they have two healers?

9876
09:36:59,390 --> 09:36:59,910
I see.

9877
09:36:59,990 --> 09:37:00,970
They're fucking cheating.

9878
09:37:00,970 --> 09:37:01,950
They're cheating.

9879
09:37:04,510 --> 09:37:05,890
We have one.

9880
09:37:06,130 --> 09:37:08,670
They should also have one.

9881
09:37:10,030 --> 09:37:11,250
There's no way.

9882
09:37:11,530 --> 09:37:12,690
It's moving fast.

9883
09:37:12,870 --> 09:37:13,510
She gets healing.

9884
09:37:16,190 --> 09:37:18,190
Here's a concept for you.

9885
09:37:18,610 --> 09:37:20,630
If you're a healer, you don't have to heal.

9886
09:37:21,170 --> 09:37:21,970
You don't have to be healed.

9887
09:37:21,990 --> 09:37:24,130
Then I have to heal fucking scrubs.

9888
09:37:24,510 --> 09:37:26,790
Oh, SK's a scrub?

9889
09:37:27,350 --> 09:37:27,870
Yeah.

9890
09:37:29,030 --> 09:37:30,430
I am not a scrub.

9891
09:37:30,630 --> 09:37:31,550
I'll have you know.

9892
09:37:33,070 --> 09:37:34,230
SK, why have you been winning?

9893
09:37:35,210 --> 09:37:36,790
This is the fake SK, remember?

9894
09:37:37,830 --> 09:37:38,150
Oh, yeah.

9895
09:37:38,330 --> 09:37:39,610
I'm an impersonator.

9896
09:37:41,190 --> 09:37:44,870
Real SK who plays video games for money would never be bad.

9897
09:37:46,010 --> 09:37:47,990
He would never have a bad game.

9898
09:37:49,230 --> 09:37:50,350
Bad games happen.

9899
09:37:50,850 --> 09:37:51,690
That's fucking life.

9900
09:37:52,990 --> 09:37:57,370
Guys, the moment they use a DPS ult, we're fucking dead.

9901
09:37:57,410 --> 09:38:01,230
Oh, there it is.

9902
09:38:01,310 --> 09:38:02,910
There's the DPS ult.

9903
09:38:03,790 --> 09:38:04,570
Guys, I'm dead.

9904
09:38:05,670 --> 09:38:06,030
I'm dead.

9905
09:38:06,750 --> 09:38:07,890
Support's dead.

9906
09:38:08,250 --> 09:38:10,590
It's only Hella.

9907
09:38:10,770 --> 09:38:11,390
Kill the Hella.

9908
09:38:15,370 --> 09:38:17,430
Oh, no.

9909
09:38:18,190 --> 09:38:19,030
Not Jensen.

9910
09:38:21,130 --> 09:38:22,410
Guys, I'm coming back.

9911
09:38:22,410 --> 09:38:24,370
My queen, Seraphine.

9912
09:38:26,390 --> 09:38:28,650
Oh, god, I'm fucking... I'm keeping you alive.

9913
09:38:28,770 --> 09:38:29,490
No, no, no.

9914
09:38:29,750 --> 09:38:31,230
Dude, they're 4 DPS now.

9915
09:38:31,670 --> 09:38:33,190
They're 4 DPS!

9916
09:38:38,930 --> 09:38:40,690
Oh, god, Groot is...

9917
09:38:42,030 --> 09:38:43,070
Groot's not having it.

9918
09:38:43,090 --> 09:38:44,730
It must have been 4 DPS that fight too, right?

9919
09:38:44,970 --> 09:38:46,950
Because they have... Wait, I'm so confused.

9920
09:38:47,190 --> 09:38:51,130
No, they saw our comp and was like, if they can do that, we can do that too.

9921
09:38:53,090 --> 09:38:54,450
2-2-2 is overrated.

9922
09:38:54,450 --> 09:38:56,550
Yeah, 2-2-2 is fucking stupid.

9923
09:38:56,690 --> 09:38:58,450
We're not Overwatch, we're Marvel rivals.

9924
09:39:05,270 --> 09:39:07,230
He's trying to steal me!

9925
09:39:08,090 --> 09:39:08,570
Help!

9926
09:39:11,090 --> 09:39:13,690
Oh, my god.

9927
09:39:16,970 --> 09:39:18,210
I killed him, I killed him, I killed him.

9928
09:39:18,210 --> 09:39:19,350
Thank you, thank you.

9929
09:39:21,450 --> 09:39:22,750
Are you alive?

9930
09:39:22,770 --> 09:39:24,990
He tried to fucking abduct me, bro.

9931
09:39:29,970 --> 09:39:31,690
We got fucking kidnapped.

9932
09:39:34,270 --> 09:39:35,490
One fear.

9933
09:39:37,010 --> 09:39:37,810
They are flanking!

9934
09:39:38,190 --> 09:39:39,030
Flanking left!

9935
09:39:44,340 --> 09:39:46,260
Oh, Penny, please.

9936
09:39:46,380 --> 09:39:47,480
I'm one support.

9937
09:39:51,100 --> 09:39:51,820
Oh, no.

9938
09:39:51,880 --> 09:39:53,520
Please, stand in a line.

9939
09:39:54,680 --> 09:39:56,380
So I can get all of you.

9940
09:39:58,360 --> 09:39:59,440
She hit me with a thumb!

9941
09:39:59,840 --> 09:40:01,880
Oh, my god, help!

9942
09:40:02,480 --> 09:40:03,800
How do I follow this?

9943
09:40:03,960 --> 09:40:05,460
It's because of my fucking aura.

9944
09:40:06,140 --> 09:40:08,380
How do I follow this?

9945
09:40:10,960 --> 09:40:13,980
He saw me play Wolverine and said, watch me.

9946
09:40:15,200 --> 09:40:16,820
And now it's my turn.

9947
09:40:17,340 --> 09:40:19,120
I'll show him how it's fucking done.

9948
09:40:20,960 --> 09:40:21,980
Oh, shit!

9949
09:40:22,240 --> 09:40:23,460
He went Hulk for you!

9950
09:40:24,800 --> 09:40:26,060
Throw me in.

9951
09:40:27,500 --> 09:40:29,880
He's going Hulk for you.

9952
09:40:30,220 --> 09:40:31,180
Oh, no.

9953
09:40:33,900 --> 09:40:35,360
It's over for them.

9954
09:40:37,140 --> 09:40:37,720
Okay.

9955
09:40:38,120 --> 09:40:39,940
How can they stand up to this?

9956
09:40:40,140 --> 09:40:41,000
Wolverine-san.

9957
09:40:41,320 --> 09:40:42,500
What are you gonna do now?

9958
09:40:45,940 --> 09:40:47,080
They're broken.

9959
09:40:47,080 --> 09:40:48,000
They're broken.

9960
09:40:49,140 --> 09:40:50,100
Let's go!

9961
09:40:51,480 --> 09:40:55,080
I don't know what to do.

9962
09:40:59,620 --> 09:41:02,740
Oh, my god.

9963
09:41:03,260 --> 09:41:05,160
He's gonna throw you like a baseball.

9964
09:41:05,720 --> 09:41:07,300
Hulk 2 on that thing.

9965
09:41:09,600 --> 09:41:11,360
Oh, he's going on the right side.

9966
09:41:11,920 --> 09:41:17,080
Of all the games we played today, this is the game we win?

9967
09:41:17,220 --> 09:41:18,000
I can't.

9968
09:41:18,200 --> 09:41:18,920
No way.

9969
09:41:19,220 --> 09:41:20,520
I gotta throw now.

9970
09:41:21,080 --> 09:41:22,920
I can't let this be my legacy.

9971
09:41:25,620 --> 09:41:27,560
It's because our teammates finally have aura.

9972
09:41:27,700 --> 09:41:28,260
You see this guy?

9973
09:41:28,400 --> 09:41:29,460
His name is Thanos Aura.

9974
09:41:29,860 --> 09:41:30,620
Oh, that's true.

9975
09:41:31,060 --> 09:41:32,500
Our teammates didn't have aura until now.

9976
09:41:33,060 --> 09:41:35,240
Oh, but he's the one that's not coming with us.

9977
09:41:35,400 --> 09:41:35,760
He's leaving.

9978
09:41:38,780 --> 09:41:40,220
He's looking at Google Maps.

9979
09:41:40,220 --> 09:41:40,540
Get him!

9980
09:41:41,910 --> 09:41:42,500
Get him!

9981
09:41:43,320 --> 09:41:45,140
Dude, he sucks at throwing!

9982
09:41:55,810 --> 09:42:00,090
I got hit.

9983
09:42:00,330 --> 09:42:01,550
I don't know.

9984
09:42:01,970 --> 09:42:04,350
Surefour didn't dive anybody and I got dived.

9985
09:42:04,370 --> 09:42:05,210
He threw me.

9986
09:42:06,230 --> 09:42:07,770
Move in and fight!

9987
09:42:11,570 --> 09:42:12,670
He's won!

9988
09:42:16,670 --> 09:42:17,610
Oh my god.

9989
09:42:17,630 --> 09:42:19,050
You didn't even kill the Wolverine.

9990
09:42:19,670 --> 09:42:20,790
His passive proc.

9991
09:42:20,830 --> 09:42:21,490
What do you want from me?

9992
09:42:21,510 --> 09:42:23,130
You have the same passive.

9993
09:42:23,730 --> 09:42:24,810
Yeah, he ran away.

9994
09:42:25,730 --> 09:42:26,870
There he is.

9995
09:42:28,790 --> 09:42:29,870
Move in and fight!

9996
09:42:31,970 --> 09:42:32,630
I win!

9997
09:42:34,870 --> 09:42:35,990
You died!

9998
09:42:39,250 --> 09:42:42,230
Why my Wolverine blood not protect me from shotgun?

9999
09:42:44,130 --> 09:42:44,830
You're right.

10000
09:42:44,930 --> 09:42:46,370
You have the fucking bones.

10001
09:42:47,010 --> 09:42:48,110
It lives through that.

10002
09:42:48,230 --> 09:42:48,690
We win.

10003
09:42:53,330 --> 09:42:55,890
The better Wolverine wins.

10004
09:43:00,190 --> 09:43:02,370
That can't be the last game.

10005
09:43:06,310 --> 09:43:08,210
Time to queue some more Wolverine.

10006
09:43:08,210 --> 09:43:10,610
Yeah, those are some bad...

10007
09:43:10,610 --> 09:43:11,390
He knows it.

10008
09:43:11,450 --> 09:43:12,410
That was a bad throw.

10009
09:43:12,550 --> 09:43:14,350
I'm not gonna lie.

10010
09:43:17,170 --> 09:43:17,870
Wolverine dip.

10011
09:43:18,070 --> 09:43:19,490
The Wolverine dip, yeah.

10012
09:43:19,970 --> 09:43:21,610
The last streak is broken now.

10013
09:43:21,710 --> 09:43:23,670
Now this is where the win streak starts, right?

10014
09:43:24,010 --> 09:43:24,550
Curse of Ra.

10015
09:43:25,250 --> 09:43:26,590
The curse has been broken.

10016
09:43:27,010 --> 09:43:28,250
No more Curse of Ra.

10017
09:43:28,850 --> 09:43:31,670
I can make this curse whenever I want.

10018
09:43:31,790 --> 09:43:32,830
No, no, no, no.

10019
09:43:32,870 --> 09:43:34,310
The curse is broken now.

10020
09:43:34,650 --> 09:43:35,470
I'm not trapped with you.

10021
09:43:35,470 --> 09:43:36,910
You guys are trapped with me.

10022
09:43:37,130 --> 09:43:38,890
No, no, no, no.

10023
09:43:38,890 --> 09:43:40,870
My rank means nothing to me.

10024
09:43:44,910 --> 09:43:47,330
He's holding us hostage, guys.

10025
09:43:48,110 --> 09:43:49,870
He's holding us hostage.

10026
09:43:50,070 --> 09:43:50,930
What do we do?

10027
09:43:53,010 --> 09:43:55,650
There's nothing we can do, I just realized.

10028
09:43:56,610 --> 09:43:57,190
Alright, guys.

10029
09:43:57,250 --> 09:43:58,390
I'll add the foogie in.

10030
09:43:59,590 --> 09:44:01,270
I have to log in to my Discord.

10031
09:44:01,430 --> 09:44:02,930
And that's why there was no foogie chat.

10032
09:44:02,930 --> 09:44:04,470
Oh, there it is.

10033
09:44:04,690 --> 09:44:05,750
What's a foogie?

10034
09:44:06,030 --> 09:44:09,490
Oh, it's like the Discord thing that lets people know.

10035
09:44:10,270 --> 09:44:11,930
I'm so fucking bouncy.

10036
09:44:12,450 --> 09:44:15,150
Yeah, it lets people know who I'm playing with on Discord.

10037
09:44:19,130 --> 09:44:19,910
Oh my god.

10038
09:44:20,390 --> 09:44:22,210
Whose internet is that shitty?

10039
09:44:23,350 --> 09:44:24,570
Whose internet is it?

10040
09:44:24,730 --> 09:44:26,330
It's on the Samsung smart fridge.

10041
09:44:26,450 --> 09:44:27,190
I'm sorry.

10042
09:44:29,950 --> 09:44:31,030
It's got a wood PC.

10043
09:44:33,770 --> 09:44:34,450
Fuck you.

10044
09:44:35,890 --> 09:44:36,770
Whoa, hey, whoa.

10045
09:44:36,890 --> 09:44:37,610
Yeah, I'm saying it.

10046
09:44:37,730 --> 09:44:41,390
Yeah, what you gonna do about it, huh?

10047
09:44:42,070 --> 09:44:42,850
Pick Wolverine.

10048
09:44:43,430 --> 09:44:44,810
Oh, is that a threat?

10049
09:44:45,330 --> 09:44:46,090
I'm so scared.

10050
09:44:46,910 --> 09:44:48,170
I have to give it to him.

10051
09:44:52,760 --> 09:44:54,560
Where the fuck is the name?

10052
09:44:54,780 --> 09:44:55,980
Why is it not showing?

10053
09:45:00,630 --> 09:45:01,370
Oh, it is.

10054
09:45:01,390 --> 09:45:02,370
It's just really tiny.

10055
09:45:02,370 --> 09:45:04,190
It's fisting time.

10056
09:45:04,570 --> 09:45:04,950
Huh?

10057
09:45:05,130 --> 09:45:05,630
Oh my.

10058
09:45:08,470 --> 09:45:09,470
What do you mean by that?

10059
09:45:10,670 --> 09:45:12,130
I'm the Iron Fist.

10060
09:45:12,910 --> 09:45:13,330
Oh.

10061
09:45:14,150 --> 09:45:15,390
It's fisting time.

10062
09:45:15,450 --> 09:45:15,950
You're gonna punch people?

10063
09:45:17,370 --> 09:45:18,650
I'm gonna fist them.

10064
09:45:23,650 --> 09:45:23,970
Okay.

10065
09:45:24,930 --> 09:45:26,070
Alright, here we go.

10066
09:45:31,320 --> 09:45:31,960
Alright.

10067
09:45:32,700 --> 09:45:34,100
Guys, you see the names now.

10068
09:45:34,100 --> 09:45:35,680
Now you know who I'm playing with.

10069
09:45:36,820 --> 09:45:39,200
SK has so many fans and Marvel's rivals.

10070
09:45:39,620 --> 09:45:40,820
Yeah, where's our fans?

10071
09:45:40,900 --> 09:45:42,620
Nobody recognized you, Surefour.

10072
09:45:42,820 --> 09:45:43,800
Yeah, I don't give a fuck.

10073
09:45:44,080 --> 09:45:44,760
I don't give a fuck.

10074
09:45:44,960 --> 09:45:46,080
Tekken Icon!

10075
09:45:54,220 --> 09:45:55,780
Wait, it's not even the real SK.

10076
09:45:56,000 --> 09:45:56,440
You're right.

10077
09:45:57,980 --> 09:45:59,760
I'm an impersonator just farming.

10078
09:46:00,820 --> 09:46:01,780
Farming compliments.

10079
09:46:02,360 --> 09:46:03,240
You please.

10080
09:46:03,860 --> 09:46:05,440
Yeah, this is why you gotta impersonate people.

10081
09:46:05,800 --> 09:46:07,540
You get to feel good about yourself.

10082
09:46:07,980 --> 09:46:09,580
Someone stole my fucking name.

10083
09:46:10,460 --> 09:46:13,060
Who the fuck took Yazdaskafraz from me, bro?

10084
09:46:13,620 --> 09:46:14,920
No way someone took that.

10085
09:46:15,240 --> 09:46:16,740
Yeah, they fucking took that, bro.

10086
09:46:17,320 --> 09:46:19,900
They took fucking Yazdaskafraz from me, bro.

10087
09:46:19,980 --> 09:46:21,300
That's the weirdest name to take.

10088
09:46:21,940 --> 09:46:22,660
Out of all of them.

10089
09:46:22,680 --> 09:46:27,480
Get the fuck over here.

10090
09:46:27,960 --> 09:46:28,940
Get in there, SK.

10091
09:46:29,020 --> 09:46:29,440
Get in there.

10092
09:46:29,440 --> 09:46:30,660
Gonna taste my venom.

10093
09:46:31,480 --> 09:46:32,920
Venom, venom, venom.

10094
09:46:33,800 --> 09:46:34,280
Nice.

10095
09:46:35,310 --> 09:46:37,040
19 inches of venom.

10096
09:46:38,000 --> 09:46:38,280
Ooh.

10097
09:46:43,180 --> 09:46:44,260
High five.

10098
09:46:45,300 --> 09:46:46,040
This is it.

10099
09:46:46,160 --> 09:46:47,600
I'm baiting, I'm baiting.

10100
09:46:49,160 --> 09:46:50,320
I'm healing!

10101
09:46:50,760 --> 09:46:51,600
I'm healing!

10102
09:46:51,600 --> 09:46:53,320
Oh my god, she's dead!

10103
09:46:53,640 --> 09:46:54,320
We're dead!

10104
09:46:55,180 --> 09:46:56,800
I thought you were gonna block.

10105
09:46:57,760 --> 09:47:00,560
I blocked the damage for SK.

10106
09:47:00,560 --> 09:47:01,720
You did not block.

10107
09:47:01,720 --> 09:47:03,520
I got hit with the thong.

10108
09:47:04,680 --> 09:47:06,080
You didn't block for me.

10109
09:47:08,280 --> 09:47:10,460
Okay, we might troll there.

10110
09:47:10,800 --> 09:47:11,280
Ouch.

10111
09:47:13,500 --> 09:47:15,980
Wait, take a little damage so I can heal Surefour.

10112
09:47:16,800 --> 09:47:17,680
No, it's okay.

10113
09:47:17,960 --> 09:47:18,720
Nevermind, it's fine.

10114
09:47:19,540 --> 09:47:20,880
Oh, oh, oh.

10115
09:47:21,980 --> 09:47:22,460
Awkward.

10116
09:47:22,680 --> 09:47:23,620
Oh, I'm taking damage.

10117
09:47:24,140 --> 09:47:25,780
He's dead, he's dead already.

10118
09:47:26,080 --> 09:47:27,320
They blocked my shit.

10119
09:47:27,320 --> 09:47:29,360
I was gonna 2v1, bro.

10120
09:47:29,420 --> 09:47:30,620
I was gonna 2v1, bro.

10121
09:47:32,240 --> 09:47:33,700
You win that if it's won.

10122
09:47:35,040 --> 09:47:36,420
Oh my god!

10123
09:47:37,420 --> 09:47:41,500
Okay, there's a Black Panther behind us.

10124
09:47:47,490 --> 09:47:48,450
I'm baiting them in.

10125
09:47:49,130 --> 09:47:50,650
I went the wrong way.

10126
09:47:52,390 --> 09:47:53,570
Alright, I'm coming over.

10127
09:47:54,170 --> 09:47:54,790
Got my one.

10128
09:47:55,770 --> 09:47:56,970
Yeah, but you're all gonna die.

10129
09:47:59,610 --> 09:48:00,050
Unless...

10130
09:48:00,050 --> 09:48:00,930
Surefour, I need you to...

10131
09:48:00,930 --> 09:48:02,710
Surefour, what the fuck are you...

10132
09:48:02,710 --> 09:48:03,070
Okay.

10133
09:48:04,290 --> 09:48:05,390
Noob, noob, noob.

10134
09:48:05,930 --> 09:48:06,610
I was healing.

10135
09:48:08,250 --> 09:48:10,050
I need a healing.

10136
09:48:13,290 --> 09:48:14,550
Wait, I have Bankai.

10137
09:48:16,170 --> 09:48:17,290
But they have their ults.

10138
09:48:17,790 --> 09:48:18,710
Alright, here we go.

10139
09:48:20,110 --> 09:48:20,910
Oh shit.

10140
09:48:21,050 --> 09:48:21,810
Okay, I'm going to go in.

10141
09:48:23,010 --> 09:48:24,090
Here we go.

10142
09:48:25,070 --> 09:48:25,870
Alright.

10143
09:48:26,090 --> 09:48:26,590
That's one!

10144
09:48:27,810 --> 09:48:29,410
I am...

10145
09:48:29,410 --> 09:48:30,770
Oh, uh oh.

10146
09:48:31,210 --> 09:48:32,870
I'm leaving in four seconds.

10147
09:48:33,110 --> 09:48:34,390
I'm leaving now.

10148
09:48:34,870 --> 09:48:36,290
I left.

10149
09:48:40,710 --> 09:48:40,970
Please.

10150
09:48:41,390 --> 09:48:41,730
No!

10151
09:48:42,550 --> 09:48:45,710
I needed you to fucking spit on me, Jeff!

10152
09:48:46,350 --> 09:48:47,030
Oh, ow.

10153
09:48:49,150 --> 09:48:51,430
That's a 2v2.

10154
09:48:52,570 --> 09:48:53,690
Uh oh.

10155
09:48:54,250 --> 09:48:55,170
I believe in you guys.

10156
09:48:55,830 --> 09:48:57,230
I'm literally coming back.

10157
09:48:59,550 --> 09:49:00,530
Let's do more.

10158
09:49:03,710 --> 09:49:05,010
Oh my god.

10159
09:49:05,070 --> 09:49:06,130
We have one more fight.

10160
09:49:06,530 --> 09:49:07,090
Okay.

10161
09:49:11,050 --> 09:49:11,990
I'm fine.

10162
09:49:14,170 --> 09:49:15,990
If you guys want to know, I'm okay.

10163
09:49:18,650 --> 09:49:19,070
Alright.

10164
09:49:19,070 --> 09:49:19,190
Oh shit.

10165
09:49:19,330 --> 09:49:19,970
I got you.

10166
09:49:20,330 --> 09:49:21,230
Surefire, I got you.

10167
09:49:23,010 --> 09:49:23,910
Alright, 90.

10168
09:49:24,350 --> 09:49:25,590
Oh my god, but who's got me?

10169
09:49:28,950 --> 09:49:29,470
Okay.

10170
09:49:31,450 --> 09:49:32,470
Oh no, Venom!

10171
09:49:32,590 --> 09:49:34,150
No, no, no, no!

10172
09:49:35,610 --> 09:49:36,610
I'm stuck!

10173
09:49:38,830 --> 09:49:39,350
Ow.

10174
09:49:41,770 --> 09:49:43,350
Venom's coming over, guys!

10175
09:49:48,090 --> 09:49:48,870
He's dead.

10176
09:49:51,010 --> 09:49:52,530
Where the fuck did she go?

10177
09:49:52,990 --> 09:49:53,950
Oh, she invised.

10178
09:49:56,530 --> 09:49:57,830
Oh my god, we're alive!

10179
09:49:59,070 --> 09:50:00,650
Yeah, because I fucking clutched out.

10180
09:50:01,590 --> 09:50:02,170
They call me the king.

10181
09:50:02,190 --> 09:50:03,590
Alright, SK, who actually clutched it?

10182
09:50:04,710 --> 09:50:05,950
That was all our health.

10183
09:50:07,350 --> 09:50:08,530
What the fuck?

10184
09:50:08,850 --> 09:50:09,750
I touched point!

10185
09:50:10,410 --> 09:50:11,070
We have a lot!

10186
09:50:12,250 --> 09:50:13,310
My bad, actually.

10187
09:50:13,310 --> 09:50:14,530
Knock on me.

10188
09:50:18,670 --> 09:50:19,830
Oh, I'm in there.

10189
09:50:20,650 --> 09:50:21,250
You're in there?

10190
09:50:22,270 --> 09:50:22,890
I'm doing it.

10191
09:50:23,150 --> 09:50:24,830
Oh, I'm not doing it anymore.

10192
09:50:26,010 --> 09:50:26,510
I got you!

10193
09:50:28,450 --> 09:50:30,090
Oh shit, I left!

10194
09:50:30,670 --> 09:50:31,330
I got scared.

10195
09:50:31,470 --> 09:50:31,970
We win this.

10196
09:50:34,650 --> 09:50:36,030
SK, get in here!

10197
09:50:36,430 --> 09:50:37,530
Oh my god, my savior.

10198
09:50:37,730 --> 09:50:38,670
You're okay!

10199
09:50:39,110 --> 09:50:40,430
My hero, Academia.

10200
09:50:40,630 --> 09:50:41,470
We're okay!

10201
09:50:41,470 --> 09:50:43,970
Everything is working out!

10202
09:50:44,050 --> 09:50:44,550
Who's next?

10203
09:50:45,310 --> 09:50:46,710
Come on, I did it first!

10204
09:50:47,610 --> 09:50:48,470
Oh shit!

10205
09:50:51,210 --> 09:50:52,210
We're okay.

10206
09:50:53,430 --> 09:50:54,590
We're okay.

10207
09:50:55,530 --> 09:50:57,210
How did we win that point?

10208
09:50:57,570 --> 09:50:59,130
You're talking to golden limbs.

10209
09:51:02,470 --> 09:51:05,810
How did we win that point?

10210
09:51:06,050 --> 09:51:06,430
Why?

10211
09:51:06,510 --> 09:51:07,610
Because I clutched out!

10212
09:51:07,730 --> 09:51:08,530
I already said it!

10213
09:51:08,530 --> 09:51:10,650
Oh shit, sorry guys!

10214
09:51:10,990 --> 09:51:12,730
For your ears, guys, sorry!

10215
09:51:18,430 --> 09:51:20,730
The scoreboard doesn't lie, I'll admit.

10216
09:51:20,970 --> 09:51:21,530
That's so true.

10217
09:51:23,410 --> 09:51:24,810
That's so true.

10218
09:51:28,810 --> 09:51:31,230
He's beast moding right now, chat.

10219
09:51:31,610 --> 09:51:32,190
He's full on.

10220
09:51:32,190 --> 09:51:33,730
Just wait until I have my Bonkai.

10221
09:51:44,910 --> 09:51:45,310
Oh my god.

10222
09:51:45,310 --> 09:51:46,930
Caffie is kicking in hard.

10223
09:51:48,370 --> 09:51:50,010
I'm beating the shit out of this fucking wall.

10224
09:51:50,830 --> 09:51:52,110
Oh, he's TPing, he's TPing!

10225
09:51:53,330 --> 09:51:57,490
I'm gonna tell my team I'm gonna TP one day and just sit there and see how long they'll wait.

10226
09:51:58,590 --> 09:52:00,010
You do that in Grandmaster.

10227
09:52:04,910 --> 09:52:05,530
Oh, I'm dead.

10228
09:52:05,770 --> 09:52:06,690
Wait, what happened?

10229
09:52:07,110 --> 09:52:10,630
Oh my god, I might be dead too, I'm going back in!

10230
09:52:10,630 --> 09:52:11,570
Oh, I got scared!

10231
09:52:12,230 --> 09:52:13,590
Oh, he's coming, he's coming!

10232
09:52:14,390 --> 09:52:15,750
I'm beating the shit out of him!

10233
09:52:16,990 --> 09:52:17,690
I'm dead.

10234
09:52:20,310 --> 09:52:21,550
Everything is fine.

10235
09:52:21,890 --> 09:52:22,850
The panther is low.

10236
09:52:24,910 --> 09:52:26,910
I'm not fine, I'm not fine.

10237
09:52:31,330 --> 09:52:33,510
Oh wait, our strange is still alive!

10238
09:52:34,670 --> 09:52:35,770
Wait, they're voring?

10239
09:52:36,310 --> 09:52:37,270
It's a vortex?

10240
09:52:37,270 --> 09:52:38,350
Oh, Jeff.

10241
09:52:40,910 --> 09:52:41,970
That's my goat.

10242
09:52:42,430 --> 09:52:44,890
He's only killed one, but that's okay.

10243
09:52:50,650 --> 09:52:52,990
I got double solo ulted!

10244
09:52:53,990 --> 09:52:56,470
My space is immaculate!

10245
09:53:00,490 --> 09:53:03,570
Hey, he's my fucking space, guys, I got fucking solo ulted.

10246
09:53:03,830 --> 09:53:04,210
Hey!

10247
09:53:04,390 --> 09:53:05,830
He's won, he's won, he's won!

10248
09:53:06,470 --> 09:53:08,050
Hey, we did it.

10249
09:53:08,170 --> 09:53:09,330
It's okay, we should regroup now.

10250
09:53:09,330 --> 09:53:10,950
I'm coming back in, no one's gotten the point yet.

10251
09:53:13,750 --> 09:53:14,590
I'm contesting.

10252
09:53:20,390 --> 09:53:20,810
Contesting!

10253
09:53:23,790 --> 09:53:25,410
Oh my god, dude, he's ulted.

10254
09:53:25,910 --> 09:53:27,010
We were so chilling.

10255
09:53:30,490 --> 09:53:33,310
That was a sacrifice of my life, win the fight.

10256
09:53:33,310 --> 09:53:33,850
Now.

10257
09:53:35,070 --> 09:53:36,430
There's a tree in front of me!

10258
09:53:36,430 --> 09:53:38,290
Win the freaking fight now!

10259
09:53:38,950 --> 09:53:39,390
Yeah!

10260
09:53:40,310 --> 09:53:42,070
We won the fight!

10261
09:53:42,630 --> 09:53:48,010
I died, there's a fucking hello right behind us.

10262
09:53:49,430 --> 09:53:50,410
I'm beating her ass.

10263
09:53:51,010 --> 09:53:51,870
Hey, you think you can run?

10264
09:53:56,550 --> 09:54:03,290
Wait, guys, Jeff is...

10265
09:54:03,290 --> 09:54:05,290
Is currently, you know...

10266
09:54:05,290 --> 09:54:06,750
Oh my god!

10267
09:54:06,790 --> 09:54:08,710
You solo ulted me, bitch!

10268
09:54:09,110 --> 09:54:11,770
I have the power of god on my side!

10269
09:54:11,830 --> 09:54:13,170
Go, fucking fight!

10270
09:54:13,430 --> 09:54:13,730
Go!

10271
09:54:14,190 --> 09:54:18,030
I solo ulted to save your fucking life!

10272
09:54:18,170 --> 09:54:19,770
You better kill somebody!

10273
09:54:20,010 --> 09:54:20,650
I'm out of this, bitch.

10274
09:54:21,030 --> 09:54:23,210
Bro, their whole team's here, I can't do shit.

10275
09:54:23,830 --> 09:54:25,070
We're all, we're here!

10276
09:54:28,270 --> 09:54:29,710
I can't believe you didn't kill anybody.

10277
09:54:30,470 --> 09:54:32,050
I can't believe you didn't kill anybody.

10278
09:54:32,710 --> 09:54:34,890
I'm beating the shit out of this tree!

10279
09:54:36,730 --> 09:54:39,050
I can't believe you didn't kill anyone!

10280
09:54:39,410 --> 09:54:41,010
I can't believe!

10281
09:54:49,310 --> 09:54:51,650
It's fine, we got 48%.

10282
09:55:00,000 --> 09:55:01,420
I believe in us.

10283
09:55:03,240 --> 09:55:04,860
There's a black panther here.

10284
09:55:05,900 --> 09:55:06,480
Kill him.

10285
09:55:06,480 --> 09:55:08,080
I'm scared.

10286
09:55:08,380 --> 09:55:09,580
I'm gonna burn all trees.

10287
09:55:15,780 --> 09:55:17,720
Oh my god!

10288
09:55:20,140 --> 09:55:20,740
Avenged.

10289
09:55:21,500 --> 09:55:22,600
He's low, he's low!

10290
09:55:22,640 --> 09:55:24,020
I'm beating the shit out of this tree!

10291
09:55:24,700 --> 09:55:25,520
Who's next?

10292
09:55:26,300 --> 09:55:27,200
I'm coming!

10293
09:55:29,340 --> 09:55:30,540
Out of the air!

10294
09:55:30,940 --> 09:55:33,080
Just live, just live!

10295
09:55:36,660 --> 09:55:37,760
Supports are here now.

10296
09:55:38,080 --> 09:55:40,400
I'm micro fracturing my fists.

10297
09:55:40,600 --> 09:55:41,400
Don't worry.

10298
09:55:42,240 --> 09:55:44,080
I got you, you got orb now.

10299
09:55:44,160 --> 09:55:45,560
You're free to go wherever you want.

10300
09:55:49,600 --> 09:55:50,720
Oh my god.

10301
09:55:51,220 --> 09:55:54,320
This guy is just fucking...

10302
09:55:54,320 --> 09:55:56,080
Shooting me from like that.

10303
09:55:56,200 --> 09:55:57,280
My ultimate ability.

10304
09:55:58,120 --> 09:55:59,700
Nice, there's a black panther behind you!

10305
09:56:02,780 --> 09:56:05,880
He's so low!

10306
09:56:07,340 --> 09:56:08,720
I got my one!

10307
09:56:09,940 --> 09:56:10,420
Me too!

10308
09:56:11,500 --> 09:56:13,520
I'm putting on a show as well, watch me dance!

10309
09:56:13,720 --> 09:56:15,180
I'm beating the shit out of this mantis!

10310
09:56:15,520 --> 09:56:16,180
Do it, do it!

10311
09:56:20,920 --> 09:56:22,820
Where was my luna ult at?

10312
09:56:24,700 --> 09:56:26,500
You were definitely not on it.

10313
09:56:26,500 --> 09:56:29,840
You were definitely not on the luna ult.

10314
09:56:30,000 --> 09:56:30,840
That's for sure.

10315
09:56:32,400 --> 09:56:35,640
It's okay, we have hell ult.

10316
09:56:35,840 --> 09:56:36,880
That's the game changer.

10317
09:56:43,540 --> 09:56:46,940
The eye of agamotto is almost charged.

10318
09:56:47,740 --> 09:56:49,220
I got my one!

10319
09:56:49,420 --> 09:56:50,900
I'm going in!

10320
09:56:51,140 --> 09:56:52,120
I need help.

10321
09:56:53,580 --> 09:56:54,320
I need help.

10322
09:56:54,480 --> 09:56:55,000
The mantis is low.

10323
09:56:55,160 --> 09:56:56,640
I'm just saying, we healed you.

10324
09:56:57,300 --> 09:56:58,600
We 100% healed.

10325
09:56:58,660 --> 09:57:05,120
I made the space.

10326
09:57:05,700 --> 09:57:06,440
Oh yikes.

10327
09:57:07,480 --> 09:57:09,220
Please don't turn around!

10328
09:57:10,580 --> 09:57:11,220
Oh yikes.

10329
09:57:12,080 --> 09:57:12,760
She's one.

10330
09:57:13,480 --> 09:57:14,880
Help please!

10331
09:57:16,160 --> 09:57:18,560
Oh my god, our health is so stuffed!

10332
09:57:19,260 --> 09:57:20,020
Wait, it's winnable.

10333
09:57:22,360 --> 09:57:24,620
She solo ulted me again bro!

10334
09:57:25,900 --> 09:57:28,240
You got double solo ulted.

10335
09:57:28,400 --> 09:57:30,060
I blocked the group ult.

10336
09:57:31,060 --> 09:57:32,940
I might be dead though.

10337
09:57:33,300 --> 09:57:33,940
No!

10338
09:57:34,760 --> 09:57:35,020
Oh wait, winnable.

10339
09:57:35,600 --> 09:57:37,600
You have shark, you have to rely on the shark.

10340
09:57:40,360 --> 09:57:42,680
Our hella is not a person.

10341
09:57:43,380 --> 09:57:44,720
She is absolutely helper.

10342
09:57:44,720 --> 09:57:45,980
She helper.

10343
09:57:49,480 --> 09:57:50,800
I clutched out.

10344
09:57:51,700 --> 09:57:53,240
Wait, we lost?

10345
09:57:53,760 --> 09:57:55,180
They have it!

10346
09:57:56,680 --> 09:57:57,400
Sheeper.

10347
09:57:58,140 --> 09:57:59,660
He had the point!

10348
09:57:59,700 --> 09:58:01,540
Oh my god.

10349
09:58:02,960 --> 09:58:05,140
Oh my god.

10350
09:58:08,480 --> 09:58:09,920
Oh my god.

10351
09:58:10,580 --> 09:58:14,340
Okay, I'm just saying, our hella is not good at...

10352
09:58:16,880 --> 09:58:20,860
I'm gonna say it, I hope he watches the stream so he knows he's bad at hella.

10353
09:58:21,220 --> 09:58:24,040
And sees what, saw what I saw in that POV.

10354
09:58:24,500 --> 09:58:25,800
That's why I said it.

10355
09:58:26,560 --> 09:58:28,580
He's the number one Doki Red fan.

10356
09:58:28,680 --> 09:58:30,520
He's been looking up to you for so long.

10357
09:58:30,800 --> 09:58:32,020
Never meet your heroes.

10358
09:58:32,620 --> 09:58:34,180
Never meet your heroes.

10359
09:58:34,180 --> 09:58:35,320
Uh oh.

10360
09:58:49,470 --> 09:58:50,930
Alright, here we go.

10361
09:58:51,710 --> 09:58:53,070
It's awesome time.

10362
09:58:53,950 --> 09:58:55,170
I'm feeling awesome.

10363
09:58:55,690 --> 09:58:56,850
I believe in us.

10364
09:58:57,010 --> 09:59:00,810
Oh, he's on Hawkeye, he wants to win.

10365
09:59:04,010 --> 09:59:04,630
Mmm...

10366
09:59:04,630 --> 09:59:06,530
I'm gonna shoot my funny little arrows.

10367
09:59:07,750 --> 09:59:09,670
Your silly little guy abilities.

10368
09:59:09,670 --> 09:59:09,890
Please.

10369
09:59:11,790 --> 09:59:13,030
Oh my god!

10370
09:59:13,130 --> 09:59:14,250
This Psylocke is really low.

10371
09:59:18,640 --> 09:59:20,380
No, Dr. Strange, please.

10372
09:59:24,480 --> 09:59:25,640
He's bringing them to you!

10373
09:59:25,700 --> 09:59:26,640
He's bringing them to you!

10374
09:59:29,080 --> 09:59:29,600
No!

10375
09:59:30,380 --> 09:59:30,900
Yes!

10376
09:59:31,220 --> 09:59:32,500
I killed their tank.

10377
09:59:33,760 --> 09:59:34,520
That Psylocke is low, that Psylocke is low.

10378
09:59:34,560 --> 09:59:36,760
I distracted their supports to make that happen.

10379
09:59:37,660 --> 09:59:38,560
That's what I did.

10380
09:59:42,000 --> 09:59:43,960
What the fuck is this Pog?

10381
09:59:44,100 --> 09:59:44,400
What?

10382
09:59:44,980 --> 09:59:50,140
I hit her shadow, but she went from 1 HP to literally full health.

10383
09:59:50,320 --> 09:59:53,460
But then they also Luna ulted, so...

10384
09:59:54,500 --> 09:59:56,740
Alright, I Luna ulted too.

10385
09:59:58,000 --> 09:59:59,620
Guys, they have point, guys.

10386
10:00:00,720 --> 10:00:03,360
This fucking passive doesn't do jack shit!

10387
10:00:03,660 --> 10:00:05,920
I think we lost this point, guys.

10388
10:00:05,920 --> 10:00:08,100
Deflect projectiles my ass!

10389
10:00:08,960 --> 10:00:10,500
Oh my god!

10390
10:00:10,600 --> 10:00:11,700
This one ain't looking good, squad.

10391
10:00:12,020 --> 10:00:14,660
Oh, they used their big ultimates.

10392
10:00:16,000 --> 10:00:18,200
They only have small ones.

10393
10:00:18,600 --> 10:00:20,060
They saved multiple ults for me.

10394
10:00:20,340 --> 10:00:21,220
What can you do?

10395
10:00:21,900 --> 10:00:23,460
You know what that means?

10396
10:00:23,680 --> 10:00:25,040
It's time to pull out.

10397
10:00:25,840 --> 10:00:26,260
Wolverine?

10398
10:00:27,800 --> 10:00:31,180
I was thinking Winter Soldier, but you know what?

10399
10:00:32,560 --> 10:00:35,660
Winter Soldier is even worse if they save ults for me.

10400
10:00:35,660 --> 10:00:40,660
No, no, if you do it again 6 times, you are behind a tree, by the way.

10401
10:00:41,060 --> 10:00:42,280
They locked you up.

10402
10:00:43,280 --> 10:00:44,540
Yeah, fuck it, bro.

10403
10:00:45,260 --> 10:00:47,080
Doctor Strange is on the point.

10404
10:00:48,080 --> 10:00:49,060
Wait, they got 2?

10405
10:00:50,260 --> 10:00:51,440
Oh, SK got 2?

10406
10:00:52,000 --> 10:00:52,280
Yep.

10407
10:00:54,260 --> 10:00:55,300
I'm dead.

10408
10:00:55,320 --> 10:00:55,960
Oh, I saw that.

10409
10:00:56,060 --> 10:00:56,940
That's pretty cool.

10410
10:00:59,300 --> 10:01:00,080
I got my 2.

10411
10:01:00,180 --> 10:01:02,900
The portal just disappeared in front of my screen.

10412
10:01:02,900 --> 10:01:05,300
I got my 3.

10413
10:01:06,220 --> 10:01:08,580
There is a shark at the bottom?

10414
10:01:12,340 --> 10:01:13,760
Alright, now is our time.

10415
10:01:15,420 --> 10:01:17,700
We're going to reversal it right here.

10416
10:01:18,120 --> 10:01:18,760
Oh,

10417
10:01:22,710 --> 10:01:23,490
they're all left side.

10418
10:01:25,110 --> 10:01:26,190
They're coming for you.

10419
10:01:26,330 --> 10:01:27,450
They're coming for you.

10420
10:01:29,230 --> 10:01:30,250
He's boring.

10421
10:01:30,870 --> 10:01:31,570
He's boring?

10422
10:01:33,370 --> 10:01:34,490
Oh, okay.

10423
10:01:34,490 --> 10:01:35,670
Oh my gosh.

10424
10:01:36,610 --> 10:01:37,810
He did it.

10425
10:01:37,990 --> 10:01:38,750
He got 3.

10426
10:01:40,170 --> 10:01:41,870
Wait, there's so many outside.

10427
10:01:42,650 --> 10:01:43,770
I can't help it.

10428
10:01:44,470 --> 10:01:45,670
Yeah, I can.

10429
10:01:45,750 --> 10:01:47,870
I got one.

10430
10:01:50,870 --> 10:01:52,290
Nice, nice, nice.

10431
10:01:53,630 --> 10:01:54,270
Epic.

10432
10:01:56,410 --> 10:01:58,250
Oh, I accidentally fell down.

10433
10:01:58,430 --> 10:02:00,170
I didn't realize the hole was up.

10434
10:02:05,280 --> 10:02:05,680
Alright.

10435
10:02:07,940 --> 10:02:09,360
Uh oh, time against the world.

10436
10:02:10,060 --> 10:02:10,980
I don't remember what that hole is.

10437
10:02:11,740 --> 10:02:13,140
Someone needs to take care of this.

10438
10:02:13,980 --> 10:02:15,380
I'm the person for the job.

10439
10:02:19,200 --> 10:02:20,580
Can you try to help Doctor Strange?

10440
10:02:22,680 --> 10:02:24,560
Watch out for that black panther behind.

10441
10:02:25,420 --> 10:02:26,360
Alright, she's dead.

10442
10:02:27,260 --> 10:02:28,920
Get the tree, get the tree, burn the tree!

10443
10:02:30,840 --> 10:02:31,280
Easy.

10444
10:02:31,820 --> 10:02:32,780
So easy.

10445
10:02:33,120 --> 10:02:34,760
Alright, they have like 5 ults.

10446
10:02:35,700 --> 10:02:39,620
It's fine, I have one Luna ult and that will deny every ult they have.

10447
10:02:39,920 --> 10:02:42,740
This guy has been holding Doctor Strange ult for the whole game.

10448
10:02:43,960 --> 10:02:45,860
Look, he's waiting for the perfect moment.

10449
10:02:46,400 --> 10:02:47,680
This is gonna be the perfect moment.

10450
10:02:47,800 --> 10:02:48,480
Just wait and see.

10451
10:02:49,840 --> 10:02:50,500
Just you wait.

10452
10:02:53,660 --> 10:02:54,540
I'm dead.

10453
10:02:55,260 --> 10:02:55,720
No you're not.

10454
10:02:55,720 --> 10:02:55,800
I'm dead.

10455
10:02:56,320 --> 10:02:56,780
No you're not.

10456
10:02:59,100 --> 10:02:59,740
He's won.

10457
10:03:01,380 --> 10:03:03,440
I have forced the Luna Snow ultimate ability.

10458
10:03:04,320 --> 10:03:05,160
I got a no reg.

10459
10:03:06,500 --> 10:03:07,700
Have you tried not doing that?

10460
10:03:07,700 --> 10:03:10,580
They forced my Luna Snow ult too because of Doctor Strange.

10461
10:03:11,200 --> 10:03:12,780
Oh, he used it, he used Doctor Strange ult!

10462
10:03:13,040 --> 10:03:13,620
He used it!

10463
10:03:16,760 --> 10:03:18,500
I got hard focused by Swag.

10464
10:03:18,700 --> 10:03:20,000
Oh no, I am Groot.

10465
10:03:21,240 --> 10:03:21,680
No!

10466
10:03:22,620 --> 10:03:24,440
I got Hella ulted!

10467
10:03:26,780 --> 10:03:28,840
I got Hella ulted!

10468
10:03:30,440 --> 10:03:32,120
That's fucking life, isn't it?

10469
10:03:32,800 --> 10:03:33,780
Wait, can we still touch it?

10470
10:03:33,820 --> 10:03:34,800
Wait, we have another fight.

10471
10:03:36,700 --> 10:03:37,660
Not really.

10472
10:03:37,760 --> 10:03:39,840
Not really.

10473
10:03:40,240 --> 10:03:42,960
I mean, I can touch.

10474
10:03:43,600 --> 10:03:45,400
I'll touch Jeff, don't worry about it.

10475
10:03:46,060 --> 10:03:46,840
You can use your ult.

10476
10:03:48,700 --> 10:03:49,580
Are you touching?

10477
10:03:49,580 --> 10:03:49,660
Are you touching?

10478
10:03:50,980 --> 10:03:51,900
I'm touching.

10479
10:03:53,180 --> 10:03:54,060
I'm so dead.

10480
10:03:55,540 --> 10:03:56,560
I got solo ulted again.

10481
10:03:56,720 --> 10:03:58,160
Oh my god.

10482
10:03:58,260 --> 10:03:59,380
Jeff, where's Jeff?

10483
10:03:59,500 --> 10:04:01,600
No, Jeff got solo ulted too!

10484
10:04:02,400 --> 10:04:04,000
He got ulted!

10485
10:04:07,520 --> 10:04:08,680
It's not our fault.

10486
10:04:09,680 --> 10:04:11,180
It was not our fault.

10487
10:04:11,820 --> 10:04:12,400
Like, look.

10488
10:04:12,740 --> 10:04:14,780
SK got ace.

10489
10:04:15,180 --> 10:04:15,780
I'm the ace.

10490
10:04:15,780 --> 10:04:18,160
Yeah, I don't think it was an us issue.

10491
10:04:18,340 --> 10:04:20,260
I think like...

10492
10:04:20,260 --> 10:04:21,220
Um...

10493
10:04:21,220 --> 10:04:23,540
Oh shit, the Hella has 50 kills.

10494
10:04:24,140 --> 10:04:26,420
It was on Hella, so you can like have that.

10495
10:04:34,020 --> 10:04:37,140
You know, since we lost, we can't end it on a loss now.

10496
10:04:37,620 --> 10:04:39,420
Yeah, we can't.

10497
10:04:39,720 --> 10:04:40,000
You're right.

10498
10:04:41,680 --> 10:04:44,580
I feel like I'm being held hostage.

10499
10:04:47,240 --> 10:04:49,880
Now you feel like you're being held hostage.

10500
10:04:55,890 --> 10:04:56,940
Last one, for sure.

10501
10:04:57,760 --> 10:04:58,460
Last one?

10502
10:04:59,140 --> 10:05:00,740
Yeah, gotta be.

10503
10:05:04,300 --> 10:05:05,460
Last one?

10504
10:05:05,880 --> 10:05:07,780
Oh shit, that's the people that think you're not real.

10505
10:05:08,500 --> 10:05:09,140
We used the bathroom.

10506
10:05:11,000 --> 10:05:11,560
Oh no.

10507
10:05:12,280 --> 10:05:14,020
The people that know I'm not real.

10508
10:05:18,020 --> 10:05:19,820
Oh, we got a good game ahead of us here.

10509
10:05:21,160 --> 10:05:21,420
Yeah?

10510
10:05:22,000 --> 10:05:22,620
Think so?

10511
10:05:23,400 --> 10:05:25,560
Yeah, we were locking for DPS for a second.

10512
10:05:26,580 --> 10:05:28,460
Oh, that means everyone's a good player.

10513
10:05:30,140 --> 10:05:31,760
Woah, woah, woah, woah.

10514
10:05:31,760 --> 10:05:32,660
She went squirrel girl.

10515
10:05:33,440 --> 10:05:34,200
I don't like that.

10516
10:05:36,660 --> 10:05:39,980
Wait, we have the person that thought I'm fake on our team.

10517
10:05:40,180 --> 10:05:41,480
I thought she was on the other team.

10518
10:05:41,480 --> 10:05:44,300
Oh no, she's leaving spawn as squirrel girl.

10519
10:05:44,920 --> 10:05:45,280
Disaster.

10520
10:05:45,740 --> 10:05:46,260
Disaster.

10521
10:05:50,360 --> 10:05:51,400
I'm worried.

10522
10:05:51,980 --> 10:05:52,660
I'm concerned.

10523
10:05:54,640 --> 10:05:55,020
Nah.

10524
10:05:55,300 --> 10:05:56,440
It'll be fine, surely.

10525
10:05:57,560 --> 10:05:57,980
Surely.

10526
10:06:01,300 --> 10:06:05,820
I need to prove to her that the fake SK can get some kills.

10527
10:06:07,540 --> 10:06:08,280
I realized we're defending.

10528
10:06:08,860 --> 10:06:10,120
I thought we were attacking.

10529
10:06:10,960 --> 10:06:12,120
Uh oh.

10530
10:06:12,580 --> 10:06:16,480
It's okay, you guys don't need Luna until later anyway.

10531
10:06:17,360 --> 10:06:20,660
We have to go through stuff anyway.

10532
10:06:23,700 --> 10:06:26,700
Okay, I was there.

10533
10:06:27,900 --> 10:06:29,920
That's not me issue right there.

10534
10:06:30,080 --> 10:06:31,200
Our healers are already dead.

10535
10:06:32,120 --> 10:06:33,580
I'm right here.

10536
10:06:33,580 --> 10:06:33,680
I'm right here.

10537
10:06:35,620 --> 10:06:36,560
Well shit.

10538
10:06:38,740 --> 10:06:39,980
Oh, I need help though.

10539
10:06:42,420 --> 10:06:43,580
Guys, I don't...

10540
10:06:48,950 --> 10:06:50,870
Oh my god, I can't.

10541
10:06:55,610 --> 10:06:56,250
It's Spiderman.

10542
10:06:56,450 --> 10:06:57,090
It's fine, we're fine.

10543
10:06:58,210 --> 10:06:58,770
Awesome.

10544
10:06:59,410 --> 10:06:59,950
He's frozen.

10545
10:07:01,930 --> 10:07:02,490
Awesome.

10546
10:07:03,050 --> 10:07:04,890
Oh, I might be dead from that.

10547
10:07:04,890 --> 10:07:06,530
Yeah, that's not awesome at all.

10548
10:07:06,590 --> 10:07:07,150
Nope.

10549
10:07:08,630 --> 10:07:13,010
Guys, I have a Venom blocking me right now.

10550
10:07:13,190 --> 10:07:13,590
Venom!

10551
10:07:16,070 --> 10:07:18,290
Just politely ask him to move.

10552
10:07:18,450 --> 10:07:19,250
I'm sure he'll listen.

10553
10:07:19,950 --> 10:07:20,750
He seems nice.

10554
10:07:22,090 --> 10:07:22,990
Guys, I need...

10555
10:07:22,990 --> 10:07:23,710
We need help.

10556
10:07:25,330 --> 10:07:26,850
I'm almost here.

10557
10:07:27,990 --> 10:07:29,250
I can touch the point.

10558
10:07:29,970 --> 10:07:32,450
Sure, forcibly getting healed from my excess healing from other stuff.

10559
10:07:32,450 --> 10:07:34,130
Oh, it's Jover.

10560
10:07:34,250 --> 10:07:36,670
Oh, I couldn't press Q!

10561
10:07:36,970 --> 10:07:38,450
It's never been more Jover.

10562
10:07:39,170 --> 10:07:42,010
Oh my god, I tried to press Q.

10563
10:07:58,890 --> 10:08:00,330
Oh, Spidey's one.

10564
10:08:00,510 --> 10:08:03,370
He has no extra, excess heal, Venom.

10565
10:08:04,510 --> 10:08:05,990
Venom has no excess heal.

10566
10:08:10,260 --> 10:08:10,940
Oh!

10567
10:08:12,940 --> 10:08:15,340
I'm gonna use my ultimate ability soon.

10568
10:08:15,440 --> 10:08:15,840
Yippee!

10569
10:08:17,200 --> 10:08:18,200
Oh shit!

10570
10:08:18,800 --> 10:08:19,920
Here we go.

10571
10:08:21,380 --> 10:08:22,060
Awesome!

10572
10:08:24,500 --> 10:08:24,960
You're fine.

10573
10:08:25,160 --> 10:08:25,740
You're so fine.

10574
10:08:26,280 --> 10:08:27,460
We got Venom.

10575
10:08:29,660 --> 10:08:31,020
There's Spider-Man.

10576
10:08:31,460 --> 10:08:32,020
He's fine.

10577
10:08:32,020 --> 10:08:33,120
Spider-Man is super...

10578
10:08:33,120 --> 10:08:33,760
He's dead.

10579
10:08:33,900 --> 10:08:34,460
Super one.

10580
10:08:35,720 --> 10:08:38,840
When do I heal again?

10581
10:08:42,200 --> 10:08:44,060
Oh, that's fine.

10582
10:08:44,480 --> 10:08:45,380
I died.

10583
10:08:48,120 --> 10:08:50,460
Is he ready to put on a show?

10584
10:08:55,230 --> 10:08:55,850
Okay.

10585
10:08:56,470 --> 10:08:56,990
Okay.

10586
10:08:56,990 --> 10:08:57,910
Okay.

10587
10:09:01,050 --> 10:09:02,370
You guys gotta stop.

10588
10:09:05,550 --> 10:09:06,310
Stop what?

10589
10:09:06,710 --> 10:09:10,170
You guys gotta stop the fucking double ult there.

10590
10:09:10,350 --> 10:09:11,150
Jesus Christ!

10591
10:09:12,590 --> 10:09:13,710
Oh, Venom's low.

10592
10:09:14,210 --> 10:09:14,770
Yeah, he is.

10593
10:09:16,730 --> 10:09:17,490
Okay, he has...

10594
10:09:17,490 --> 10:09:19,190
Lucio beat it for us.

10595
10:09:23,260 --> 10:09:24,080
Oh no!

10596
10:09:25,060 --> 10:09:26,560
Oh my god, please.

10597
10:09:26,560 --> 10:09:27,780
I need transcendence.

10598
10:09:27,940 --> 10:09:30,240
Oh no, we need another transcendence.

10599
10:09:32,420 --> 10:09:32,980
Please!

10600
10:09:35,460 --> 10:09:36,560
I'm kidding.

10601
10:09:36,660 --> 10:09:37,960
I broke their respawn thingy.

10602
10:09:41,060 --> 10:09:43,900
I got my one.

10603
10:09:44,400 --> 10:09:45,560
We're coming back now.

10604
10:09:46,020 --> 10:09:47,500
It ain't looking good for me back here.

10605
10:09:48,000 --> 10:09:48,840
That's fine.

10606
10:09:49,020 --> 10:09:50,560
Lady Sapphire has...

10607
10:09:52,160 --> 10:09:54,560
This is not fine because...

10608
10:09:55,200 --> 10:09:56,320
Oh shit, it's again!

10609
10:09:58,580 --> 10:10:00,080
Don't worry, I clutched out.

10610
10:10:00,340 --> 10:10:00,840
It's whatever.

10611
10:10:01,220 --> 10:10:02,100
Yeah, don't worry.

10612
10:10:02,540 --> 10:10:04,660
I try not to make a big deal out of it or anything.

10613
10:10:04,960 --> 10:10:05,460
It's whatever.

10614
10:10:05,760 --> 10:10:08,760
I thank God that we got two tanks and that's why we're able to stabilize.

10615
10:10:10,540 --> 10:10:11,320
Yeah, awesome.

10616
10:10:12,340 --> 10:10:13,100
Thank God.

10617
10:10:13,340 --> 10:10:14,360
Shout out Lady Sapphire.

10618
10:10:14,840 --> 10:10:17,340
Yeah, shout out to Lady Sapphire for saving that game.

10619
10:10:17,820 --> 10:10:18,960
Wait, what about shout out me?

10620
10:10:20,020 --> 10:10:21,540
I thought you said it was nothing.

10621
10:10:22,660 --> 10:10:25,300
No, I was trying to be nonchalant about it.

10622
10:10:25,320 --> 10:10:26,420
I was trying to be nonchalant about it.

10623
10:10:26,420 --> 10:10:27,940
So you're not helpful at all.

10624
10:10:29,980 --> 10:10:33,520
There's a chill guy that just wants a little bit of praise every now and then.

10625
10:10:34,440 --> 10:10:36,240
Alright, you did a good job.

10626
10:10:36,800 --> 10:10:38,400
That doesn't mean anything anymore.

10627
10:10:38,580 --> 10:10:39,620
Oh shit, that's too real.

10628
10:10:39,620 --> 10:10:40,620
I'm a sad guy.

10629
10:10:40,940 --> 10:10:43,120
You need a lot of praise.

10630
10:10:44,860 --> 10:10:45,820
I'm ultimating.

10631
10:10:48,280 --> 10:10:49,800
I messed up really bad.

10632
10:10:50,720 --> 10:10:51,880
It did not work.

10633
10:10:52,020 --> 10:10:52,540
Oh, nice.

10634
10:10:54,280 --> 10:10:54,880
Perhaps...

10635
10:10:55,520 --> 10:10:57,440
You Roadhogged him.

10636
10:10:57,780 --> 10:10:59,260
There's a Hella behind you guys.

10637
10:11:01,120 --> 10:11:01,720
Why?

10638
10:11:03,520 --> 10:11:05,020
Why did he do that?

10639
10:11:12,070 --> 10:11:13,530
Alright, no more dancing.

10640
10:11:13,890 --> 10:11:14,570
Dancing's over.

10641
10:11:16,850 --> 10:11:18,450
Magneto is quite low on health points.

10642
10:11:19,510 --> 10:11:19,850
Oh dear.

10643
10:11:20,530 --> 10:11:21,230
He's dead.

10644
10:11:21,230 --> 10:11:22,430
Nice, he's gone.

10645
10:11:22,490 --> 10:11:24,950
I think our Venom might be dead.

10646
10:11:24,950 --> 10:11:27,150
That's another day for a chill guy like you.

10647
10:11:28,290 --> 10:11:29,590
Yeah, it's whatever.

10648
10:11:30,390 --> 10:11:31,130
It's whatever.

10649
10:11:31,270 --> 10:11:32,410
I just killed Magneto.

10650
10:11:32,630 --> 10:11:33,390
He's nothing, right?

10651
10:11:33,950 --> 10:11:36,170
He's supposed to counter my bullets and shit.

10652
10:11:37,110 --> 10:11:38,190
I'm fucking Bucky.

10653
10:11:38,330 --> 10:11:39,150
I'm the Winter Soldier.

10654
10:11:39,890 --> 10:11:40,470
I love him.

10655
10:11:42,330 --> 10:11:44,530
Aren't you going to be the new Captain America soon?

10656
10:11:45,510 --> 10:11:45,990
Huh?

10657
10:11:50,130 --> 10:11:53,490
I thought that was that other guy that's becoming Captain America.

10658
10:11:54,170 --> 10:11:55,330
Isn't there like a...

10659
10:11:55,330 --> 10:11:56,610
At one point, Bucky becomes Captain America.

10660
10:11:56,610 --> 10:11:58,650
I don't know anything about superhero movies.

10661
10:11:59,530 --> 10:12:01,290
I watched the Avengers movie.

10662
10:12:02,050 --> 10:12:06,610
I know like in the movies, yeah, but I know in the comic books he becomes Captain America at one point.

10663
10:12:07,030 --> 10:12:07,790
Oh my god, how?

10664
10:12:08,550 --> 10:12:09,370
Oh, hello.

10665
10:12:10,030 --> 10:12:11,490
Thank you.

10666
10:12:13,870 --> 10:12:15,430
I broke the respawn.

10667
10:12:16,090 --> 10:12:16,570
Nice.

10668
10:12:17,830 --> 10:12:18,830
We're all dead.

10669
10:12:20,450 --> 10:12:21,690
That's not awesome.

10670
10:12:22,070 --> 10:12:22,830
That's not, yeah.

10671
10:12:23,030 --> 10:12:24,610
That's not really awesome.

10672
10:12:24,830 --> 10:12:26,110
He also walled us off.

10673
10:12:26,550 --> 10:12:27,390
You put three trees.

10674
10:12:27,510 --> 10:12:28,590
What do I do, Surefour?

10675
10:12:29,350 --> 10:12:30,010
It could be worse.

10676
10:12:31,330 --> 10:12:31,390
Oh.

10677
10:12:36,540 --> 10:12:37,400
It's going to be fine, right?

10678
10:12:38,220 --> 10:12:39,580
We win that one.

10679
10:12:40,380 --> 10:12:41,340
Yep, always.

10680
10:12:41,340 --> 10:12:43,920
Just another day for a chill girl like me.

10681
10:12:44,080 --> 10:12:45,020
Oh, good.

10682
10:12:46,060 --> 10:12:47,560
You're all so healthy.

10683
10:12:47,840 --> 10:12:51,400
I'm literally watching all your HP being super fucking healthy.

10684
10:12:53,040 --> 10:12:53,520
I'm farming.

10685
10:12:54,440 --> 10:12:55,880
Alright, let's spawn, Captain.

10686
10:12:56,100 --> 10:12:57,160
Fuck it, let's roll.

10687
10:12:58,080 --> 10:13:00,060
Hella's wa-uh-ful.

10688
10:13:00,420 --> 10:13:02,140
Yeah, Hella went back into her spawn.

10689
10:13:02,260 --> 10:13:02,940
That seems right.

10690
10:13:05,860 --> 10:13:06,780
Oh no.

10691
10:13:08,940 --> 10:13:10,060
Oh no.

10692
10:13:10,060 --> 10:13:10,800
Oh no.

10693
10:13:11,740 --> 10:13:13,440
I don't feel so good.

10694
10:13:13,560 --> 10:13:14,460
It's okay.

10695
10:13:14,900 --> 10:13:16,120
He can't again us.

10696
10:13:17,200 --> 10:13:18,880
He can't again us, guys.

10697
10:13:19,260 --> 10:13:20,640
I did it, I saved us.

10698
10:13:27,900 --> 10:13:28,960
Okay, I got you guys.

10699
10:13:30,260 --> 10:13:30,780
Excellent.

10700
10:13:31,140 --> 10:13:32,680
I don't know who has Venom, though.

10701
10:13:35,560 --> 10:13:36,360
Oh, nice.

10702
10:13:37,680 --> 10:13:38,660
That's my goat.

10703
10:13:40,480 --> 10:13:41,540
Oh, what the fuck?

10704
10:13:42,540 --> 10:13:43,480
Don't get real firepower.

10705
10:13:43,480 --> 10:13:45,200
Oh, I have to reload my hands, sorry.

10706
10:13:50,890 --> 10:13:52,350
Oh, I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead.

10707
10:13:53,090 --> 10:13:53,670
No heals.

10708
10:13:55,110 --> 10:13:55,990
No problem.

10709
10:13:56,790 --> 10:14:00,710
I thought you said there's no problem.

10710
10:14:02,930 --> 10:14:03,630
It's okay.

10711
10:14:04,710 --> 10:14:06,030
We have Surefour's ult.

10712
10:14:06,750 --> 10:14:07,550
He's gonna go again.

10713
10:14:08,210 --> 10:14:09,370
I have an orb on you.

10714
10:14:12,390 --> 10:14:13,450
There's an orb on you.

10715
10:14:13,450 --> 10:14:14,430
He didn't go again.

10716
10:14:15,070 --> 10:14:17,050
I have to bide my time.

10717
10:14:22,200 --> 10:14:23,830
I must have my ultimate again.

10718
10:14:24,730 --> 10:14:26,010
Get shit on!

10719
10:14:26,570 --> 10:14:27,250
Nice.

10720
10:14:28,850 --> 10:14:29,750
This might be it.

10721
10:14:35,230 --> 10:14:36,340
Oh, shit!

10722
10:14:38,760 --> 10:14:41,400
How did none of them die there?

10723
10:14:42,940 --> 10:14:43,900
Are you serious?

10724
10:14:43,900 --> 10:14:44,140
Jesus!

10725
10:14:46,040 --> 10:14:47,080
Holy shit!

10726
10:14:47,160 --> 10:14:49,760
I knew I should have fucking trusted only myself.

10727
10:14:50,320 --> 10:14:53,020
I did not say you can do it now!

10728
10:14:53,200 --> 10:14:56,080
I said you have it.

10729
10:14:58,680 --> 10:15:00,420
I didn't encourage anything.

10730
10:15:01,540 --> 10:15:02,340
Now I'm not saying you.

10731
10:15:04,180 --> 10:15:04,900
I have ult.

10732
10:15:06,800 --> 10:15:07,360
I'm doing it.

10733
10:15:08,420 --> 10:15:11,220
It's okay, SK is here to make up for it.

10734
10:15:12,600 --> 10:15:13,500
I died.

10735
10:15:13,800 --> 10:15:15,320
They're all dead.

10736
10:15:15,760 --> 10:15:16,620
It's fine.

10737
10:15:17,120 --> 10:15:19,060
You did what you needed to do.

10738
10:15:19,480 --> 10:15:20,820
I sacrificed myself.

10739
10:15:30,730 --> 10:15:33,030
What time do y'all usually go to bed?

10740
10:15:34,490 --> 10:15:35,370
That's a good question.

10741
10:15:35,750 --> 10:15:37,370
Like 6am.

10742
10:15:39,930 --> 10:15:41,010
So you still have another hour?

10743
10:15:41,830 --> 10:15:43,350
No, it's 5.30.

10744
10:15:43,350 --> 10:15:45,130
You still have another hour?

10745
10:15:46,770 --> 10:15:47,590
Half an hour.

10746
10:15:49,510 --> 10:15:52,270
What's another hour more?

10747
10:15:52,470 --> 10:15:54,150
The sun's about to rise over here.

10748
10:15:56,770 --> 10:15:57,570
That's crazy.

10749
10:16:00,870 --> 10:16:02,190
Wait, but you just had coffee.

10750
10:16:03,770 --> 10:16:05,230
That wasn't me, that was him.

10751
10:16:05,250 --> 10:16:06,370
Yeah, I know, I'm saying Surefour.

10752
10:16:06,470 --> 10:16:07,870
Didn't Surefour just have coffee?

10753
10:16:08,830 --> 10:16:10,910
Yeah, so you're gonna go to bed after?

10754
10:16:10,910 --> 10:16:14,310
I sleep better if I have shit before bed.

10755
10:16:14,470 --> 10:16:15,170
Wait, really?

10756
10:16:15,450 --> 10:16:15,970
Caffeine?

10757
10:16:16,050 --> 10:16:16,230
Yeah.

10758
10:16:16,990 --> 10:16:19,110
That's the opposite of what caffeine does.

10759
10:16:20,150 --> 10:16:20,410
No.

10760
10:16:26,530 --> 10:16:28,510
You guys wanna play more tomorrow?

10761
10:16:29,930 --> 10:16:30,450
Yes.

10762
10:16:30,770 --> 10:16:32,070
We have to get out of the circus.

10763
10:16:33,210 --> 10:16:34,830
Are you sure we're gonna play more tomorrow?

10764
10:16:35,010 --> 10:16:36,030
But not at 6am.

10765
10:16:36,290 --> 10:16:37,890
I got things to do tomorrow.

10766
10:16:37,890 --> 10:16:38,710
What?

10767
10:16:38,850 --> 10:16:40,110
You have things to do?

10768
10:16:40,250 --> 10:16:40,950
Like what?

10769
10:16:41,610 --> 10:16:43,930
Dungeon some dragons and throw it in Liberty.

10770
10:16:44,350 --> 10:16:46,070
Oh my god.

10771
10:16:46,490 --> 10:16:49,190
But tomorrow's not the weekend.

10772
10:16:50,350 --> 10:16:51,370
Yeah, but it's Wednesday.

10773
10:16:51,490 --> 10:16:53,410
That's when I have D&D and throw it in Liberty.

10774
10:16:54,630 --> 10:16:56,030
Oh my god.

10775
10:16:56,110 --> 10:16:58,230
We gotta fucking kill Tevin, the arch boss.

10776
10:16:58,750 --> 10:16:59,690
Who's Tevin?

10777
10:16:59,770 --> 10:17:00,890
Who the fuck is Tevin?

10778
10:17:00,890 --> 10:17:07,570
Tevin is a world boss that only is once a week that all of the guilds try and get and they drop really important weapons.

10779
10:17:08,170 --> 10:17:10,030
Yeah, but like what time is that?

10780
10:17:10,670 --> 10:17:11,530
It's super important, you gotta be there.

10781
10:17:11,930 --> 10:17:12,230
Yep.

10782
10:17:12,770 --> 10:17:14,050
Yeah, but what time is Tevin?

10783
10:17:15,150 --> 10:17:16,990
It's at like 7pm.

10784
10:17:17,430 --> 10:17:21,670
And then I have D&D at 3 and that usually goes to like 5 or 6.

10785
10:17:21,690 --> 10:17:23,310
Oh my god, you have a long day.

10786
10:17:24,430 --> 10:17:24,910
Yeah.

10787
10:17:25,710 --> 10:17:26,850
That's why I said I'm busy.

10788
10:17:27,570 --> 10:17:32,430
You said you're busy as in like D&D.

10789
10:17:32,430 --> 10:17:32,730
D&D.

10790
10:17:33,610 --> 10:17:36,070
No, Dungeons and Dragons, nerd.

10791
10:17:36,570 --> 10:17:37,430
Yeah, D&D.

10792
10:17:37,990 --> 10:17:39,430
Yeah, Dungeons and Dragons.

10793
10:17:39,510 --> 10:17:42,570
Yeah, I didn't say it's not Dungeons and Dragons.

10794
10:17:43,070 --> 10:17:45,390
Yeah, but I said I'm busy because I have D&D.

10795
10:17:46,050 --> 10:17:48,870
Okay, what's the current storyline for D&D right now?

10796
10:17:51,750 --> 10:17:53,870
Where were you at in the D&D part?

10797
10:17:53,890 --> 10:17:55,110
I've eliminated the raccoon.

10798
10:17:55,410 --> 10:17:57,010
We're doing Curse of Shrod.

10799
10:17:59,730 --> 10:18:00,770
Curse of Shrod.

10800
10:18:01,010 --> 10:18:02,670
The Venom has no extra heals.

10801
10:18:02,790 --> 10:18:03,410
He's at HP.

10802
10:18:03,870 --> 10:18:04,770
Or he's after HP.

10803
10:18:05,550 --> 10:18:06,950
Venom has been eliminated.

10804
10:18:07,790 --> 10:18:08,110
Venom!

10805
10:18:14,430 --> 10:18:17,270
Hey, we did it.

10806
10:18:17,270 --> 10:18:19,730
We just saved the Wizard of Lion's establishment.

10807
10:18:20,390 --> 10:18:21,170
Nice, we did it, guys.

10808
10:18:21,170 --> 10:18:22,610
And then I stole his healing potions.

10809
10:18:22,950 --> 10:18:23,690
In D&D?

10810
10:18:23,690 --> 10:18:24,770
Yeah.

10811
10:18:25,270 --> 10:18:27,030
You stole his healing potion?

10812
10:18:27,590 --> 10:18:30,490
Wait, what are you playing as in D&D?

10813
10:18:30,610 --> 10:18:33,570
I'm playing Greml, the level 8 Intelligence Barbarian.

10814
10:18:33,970 --> 10:18:34,690
Totem Warrior.

10815
10:18:35,390 --> 10:18:36,490
Is level 8 smart?

10816
10:18:37,770 --> 10:18:38,190
No.

10817
10:18:39,330 --> 10:18:40,990
8 INT is really bad.

10818
10:18:42,130 --> 10:18:44,070
Oh, I thought 8 was pretty high.

10819
10:18:44,550 --> 10:18:45,230
Yeah, wait.

10820
10:18:45,870 --> 10:18:47,130
20 is high.

10821
10:18:47,530 --> 10:18:48,310
20 is high.

10822
10:18:49,010 --> 10:18:53,350
We're playing hardcore and random world stats.

10823
10:18:55,150 --> 10:18:55,750
Oh.

10824
10:18:56,990 --> 10:18:58,390
Oh my god, I was against the world!

10825
10:18:59,030 --> 10:19:04,630
Hardcore means it's a lot more difficult and it's way punishing.

10826
10:19:05,250 --> 10:19:06,070
Like, how so?

10827
10:19:07,050 --> 10:19:19,650
Like, for example, I lost my arm because a scarecrow feared me and then crit me and then I went incapped and then he rolled injury dice and the injury was me losing my fucking arm.

10828
10:19:19,650 --> 10:19:21,410
Holy shit!

10829
10:19:22,010 --> 10:19:23,630
That's rough, buddy.

10830
10:19:24,730 --> 10:19:26,430
That's fucking rough, buddy.

10831
10:19:31,300 --> 10:19:32,580
How are we winning this?

10832
10:19:33,440 --> 10:19:35,120
Oh, I'm missing now.

10833
10:19:36,140 --> 10:19:36,920
Oh no!

10834
10:19:37,240 --> 10:19:38,740
Why did I say that?

10835
10:19:39,400 --> 10:19:42,500
I always

10836
10:19:47,220 --> 10:19:48,080
come back.

10837
10:19:48,740 --> 10:19:49,680
Wait, who's in your...

10838
10:19:49,680 --> 10:19:52,600
What other characters in your crew are?

10839
10:19:54,140 --> 10:19:54,580
Sorry.

10840
10:19:54,680 --> 10:19:56,200
I don't even know if that was great English.

10841
10:19:56,500 --> 10:19:58,440
We have Brag, who's a priest.

10842
10:19:59,100 --> 10:19:59,680
Greg the priest?

10843
10:20:00,600 --> 10:20:01,560
Yeah, Brag the priest.

10844
10:20:01,740 --> 10:20:05,940
We have Glory and Garen, who are two halfling brother and sister.

10845
10:20:09,840 --> 10:20:11,000
Wait, don't fucking shoot at me.

10846
10:20:11,740 --> 10:20:14,360
And then we've had five characters die already.

10847
10:20:14,520 --> 10:20:16,320
Wait, five characters die?

10848
10:20:16,640 --> 10:20:17,860
Did they just stop playing?

10849
10:20:18,620 --> 10:20:19,340
No, no, no.

10850
10:20:19,480 --> 10:20:20,400
New people come in.

10851
10:20:20,400 --> 10:20:23,840
Oh, so like, they die and then you just grab new people in?

10852
10:20:24,940 --> 10:20:26,700
Well, like, they make a new character.

10853
10:20:26,920 --> 10:20:27,380
Oh!

10854
10:20:27,820 --> 10:20:32,700
I thought like when you say that, I thought you meant like they just got kicked out.

10855
10:20:33,120 --> 10:20:34,600
Some people do things like that.

10856
10:20:37,040 --> 10:20:39,720
Yeah, I saw a YouTube video about that.

10857
10:20:41,200 --> 10:20:43,400
That's like a guy who's been playing one game forever.

10858
10:20:45,060 --> 10:20:48,940
My character and Brag are the only OG characters still alive.

10859
10:20:49,440 --> 10:20:52,400
How does a level 8 barbarian stay alive?

10860
10:20:52,940 --> 10:20:54,160
I don't know.

10861
10:20:54,220 --> 10:20:54,900
8 INT.

10862
10:20:55,200 --> 10:20:58,000
We're level like 5, I think.

10863
10:20:58,900 --> 10:21:01,800
Yeah, but how is he still alive by being so dumb?

10864
10:21:02,740 --> 10:21:02,980
Yeah.

10865
10:21:03,220 --> 10:21:05,400
Because he is a spirit.

10866
10:21:05,660 --> 10:21:07,560
I think it's totem something.

10867
10:21:07,680 --> 10:21:10,920
Basically, when I rage, I take half damage from everything.

10868
10:21:11,480 --> 10:21:13,060
Oh, I see.

10869
10:21:13,100 --> 10:21:19,040
Then I have adamantite half plate, so I don't take any extra damage from crits.

10870
10:21:19,560 --> 10:21:19,960
Oh!

10871
10:21:23,180 --> 10:21:23,880
I'm scared.

10872
10:21:23,880 --> 10:21:25,520
I'm a gigatame, pretty much.

10873
10:21:27,220 --> 10:21:28,380
With no arm.

10874
10:21:31,800 --> 10:21:34,440
He didn't again me, but everybody else is dead.

10875
10:21:36,560 --> 10:21:37,120
Again!

10876
10:21:39,940 --> 10:21:43,220
He didn't kill me, but everybody else is dead still.

10877
10:21:44,580 --> 10:21:45,100
Oh!

10878
10:21:45,100 --> 10:21:46,020
Bum bum bum!

10879
10:21:47,440 --> 10:21:47,960
Bum!

10880
10:21:50,040 --> 10:21:50,560
Oh!

10881
10:21:51,140 --> 10:21:53,420
My fucking support didn't look at me!

10882
10:21:54,360 --> 10:21:55,340
Hell is broken.

10883
10:21:55,560 --> 10:21:56,140
Hell is broken.

10884
10:21:56,320 --> 10:21:57,120
Hell is hella broken.

10885
10:21:57,260 --> 10:21:58,020
Okay, I'm locking in now.

10886
10:22:01,340 --> 10:22:02,640
Coming back in.

10887
10:22:03,820 --> 10:22:06,560
I think the D&D talk might have distracted us a little.

10888
10:22:11,400 --> 10:22:12,120
Oh!

10889
10:22:12,120 --> 10:22:12,560
Oh!

10890
10:22:16,140 --> 10:22:17,100
He's low.

10891
10:22:19,100 --> 10:22:20,060
Venom low.

10892
10:22:23,220 --> 10:22:24,160
What the?

10893
10:22:26,640 --> 10:22:28,620
Dr. Strange is half HP.

10894
10:22:29,040 --> 10:22:29,060
Oh!

10895
10:22:31,740 --> 10:22:33,620
By the eye of Nagamoto.

10896
10:22:34,120 --> 10:22:35,240
Just saying my thing.

10897
10:22:40,520 --> 10:22:42,580
There's a Cloaking Dagger behind us.

10898
10:22:44,740 --> 10:22:47,940
I got cancelled by Hella's E again.

10899
10:22:48,120 --> 10:22:53,020
I have Venom behind us.

10900
10:22:55,120 --> 10:22:56,640
Oh my god.

10901
10:22:56,940 --> 10:22:57,980
Someone has to stay on board.

10902
10:23:00,040 --> 10:23:06,190
I didn't think he was going to hit me.

10903
10:23:07,250 --> 10:23:08,950
We got help by Mantis.

10904
10:23:08,950 --> 10:23:10,130
Our man needs help.

10905
10:23:14,820 --> 10:23:15,820
I'm coming back.

10906
10:23:21,810 --> 10:23:22,490
Yay!

10907
10:23:31,100 --> 10:23:32,920
I'm opening a portal.

10908
10:23:34,400 --> 10:23:35,080
Awesome!

10909
10:23:35,940 --> 10:23:36,920
Oh my god!

10910
10:23:37,980 --> 10:23:38,400
Kick him out!

10911
10:23:38,480 --> 10:23:38,840
Kick him out!

10912
10:23:38,940 --> 10:23:39,920
Kick him out!

10913
10:23:41,640 --> 10:23:43,000
Holy shit!

10914
10:23:43,340 --> 10:23:45,120
He never got past the portal!

10915
10:23:45,360 --> 10:23:46,520
We never let him through.

10916
10:23:46,520 --> 10:23:46,700
We never let him through.

10917
10:23:53,500 --> 10:23:56,060
I can't believe we body blocked the portal.

10918
10:24:07,750 --> 10:24:10,030
I have ult in 20.

10919
10:24:14,930 --> 10:24:16,050
There you go, farming.

10920
10:24:19,710 --> 10:24:20,730
And he's frozen?

10921
10:24:21,150 --> 10:24:21,670
I don't know.

10922
10:24:22,050 --> 10:24:23,450
Honestly, it looked like he was.

10923
10:24:27,800 --> 10:24:28,660
I have ult here.

10924
10:24:29,200 --> 10:24:30,300
Oh, he's nice defensive though.

10925
10:24:35,020 --> 10:24:36,520
Guess I use it here.

10926
10:24:42,280 --> 10:24:44,180
We have to kill some people first.

10927
10:24:52,280 --> 10:24:53,680
I knew it!

10928
10:24:53,740 --> 10:24:55,360
I had a feeling I was going to use it too.

10929
10:24:57,260 --> 10:24:57,660
No!

10930
10:25:00,620 --> 10:25:02,140
You have Mantis.

10931
10:25:02,300 --> 10:25:03,500
Oh no, Mantis is dead.

10932
10:25:03,700 --> 10:25:04,000
No!

10933
10:25:09,280 --> 10:25:10,620
I'm coming back.

10934
10:25:10,620 --> 10:25:11,080
Oh.

10935
10:25:14,900 --> 10:25:17,300
I had to pick and choose what to ult.

10936
10:25:19,380 --> 10:25:19,980
No!

10937
10:25:20,800 --> 10:25:21,720
You're so close!

10938
10:25:24,920 --> 10:25:28,440
I had to pick and choose what to ult for.

10939
10:25:30,480 --> 10:25:33,960
I didn't know we would live the first aggressive ult.

10940
10:25:37,060 --> 10:25:39,300
Well, you can't expect to win them all.

10941
10:25:39,380 --> 10:25:42,500
That was a good game.

10942
10:25:43,020 --> 10:25:44,780
I'm going to sleep.

10943
10:25:45,040 --> 10:25:46,400
I can end on that loss.

10944
10:25:46,600 --> 10:25:47,560
That loss is fine.

10945
10:25:48,380 --> 10:25:48,380
Really?

10946
10:25:49,140 --> 10:25:51,040
You want to end on the loss?

10947
10:25:51,620 --> 10:25:52,460
I'm gonna...

10948
10:25:52,460 --> 10:25:54,020
You are such a bad influence.

10949
10:25:55,220 --> 10:25:55,740
Really?

10950
10:25:57,000 --> 10:25:57,520
Really?

10951
10:25:57,860 --> 10:25:59,780
Yes, yes, yes.

10952
10:25:59,900 --> 10:26:00,580
Oh my god.

10953
10:26:01,880 --> 10:26:03,800
You can't loss, right?

10954
10:26:04,320 --> 10:26:05,640
I can do whatever I want.

10955
10:26:05,640 --> 10:26:06,240
Yeah?

10956
10:26:06,460 --> 10:26:07,420
And what is that?

10957
10:26:08,440 --> 10:26:09,480
Whatever I want.

10958
10:26:09,660 --> 10:26:10,520
And what is that?

10959
10:26:11,080 --> 10:26:12,100
Whatever I want.

10960
10:26:13,140 --> 10:26:14,580
Whatever I want.

10961
10:26:14,860 --> 10:26:17,020
You still have 30 minutes till bedtime.

10962
10:26:17,780 --> 10:26:19,140
I can do whatever I want.

10963
10:26:19,340 --> 10:26:19,640
Yeah?

10964
10:26:26,900 --> 10:26:28,740
Alright, fine.

10965
10:26:29,640 --> 10:26:30,660
I'm cool with that.

10966
10:26:33,000 --> 10:26:33,340
Cool.

10967
10:26:40,600 --> 10:26:41,960
I can't believe.

10968
10:26:42,720 --> 10:26:43,560
I can.

10969
10:26:43,680 --> 10:26:44,600
I can't believe.

10970
10:26:45,500 --> 10:26:47,200
The games went through this bad.

10971
10:26:48,620 --> 10:26:51,520
How did it go this bad after you left?

10972
10:26:54,240 --> 10:26:56,240
You don't want the answer to that question.

10973
10:26:58,120 --> 10:27:01,960
Knowledge in life is better left unanswered.

10974
10:27:11,010 --> 10:27:12,650
Wait, did I get you back down?

10975
10:27:12,650 --> 10:27:14,610
Are you...

10976
10:27:14,610 --> 10:27:15,810
No, you're still diamond?

10977
10:27:16,070 --> 10:27:16,390
How?

10978
10:27:17,130 --> 10:27:18,190
Yeah, you're fucking mad.

10979
10:27:19,090 --> 10:27:20,410
You're still diamond.

10980
10:27:20,810 --> 10:27:21,730
Yeah, you're fucking mad.

10981
10:27:24,530 --> 10:27:25,750
How the fuck?

10982
10:27:26,710 --> 10:27:27,430
You're mad.

10983
10:27:27,710 --> 10:27:28,450
I am mad.

10984
10:27:28,570 --> 10:27:30,210
I want you down in the pits here.

10985
10:27:31,190 --> 10:27:31,630
You're mad.

10986
10:27:31,830 --> 10:27:33,450
Down in the dungeon.

10987
10:27:33,750 --> 10:27:34,950
In the fucking circus.

10988
10:27:36,810 --> 10:27:38,310
Can you play the right version?

10989
10:27:39,530 --> 10:27:39,830
What?

10990
10:27:39,950 --> 10:27:40,950
Which one is the right version?

10991
10:27:43,210 --> 10:27:44,550
Tell me the right version.

10992
10:27:45,490 --> 10:27:45,750
No.

10993
10:27:52,790 --> 10:27:55,130
Why is he saying oh yeah, let's throw?

10994
10:27:55,270 --> 10:27:56,510
What the fuck happened?

10995
10:27:57,050 --> 10:27:57,510
There you go.

10996
10:27:57,650 --> 10:27:58,690
I sent it to you.

10997
10:27:58,890 --> 10:28:00,670
Oh, it's because we have 3 DPS.

10998
10:28:03,990 --> 10:28:05,750
I'm not playing that on stream.

10999
10:28:05,930 --> 10:28:07,590
I want to keep that.

11000
10:28:08,750 --> 10:28:09,710
I'm down.

11001
10:28:09,870 --> 10:28:11,670
I've lost 10 in a row.

11002
10:28:13,510 --> 10:28:14,470
Oh, bro.

11003
10:28:17,590 --> 10:28:19,790
Welcome to the dungeon.

11004
10:28:24,470 --> 10:28:25,410
Get the orb.

11005
10:28:31,070 --> 10:28:32,950
I can't believe you won't play this song.

11006
10:28:33,830 --> 10:28:34,990
I can't play it.

11007
10:28:35,010 --> 10:28:35,810
I can't play it.

11008
10:28:35,930 --> 10:28:37,190
I can't play it.

11009
10:28:37,190 --> 10:28:38,210
It's not...

11010
10:28:38,210 --> 10:28:39,450
I won't have my VOD.

11011
10:28:39,650 --> 10:28:41,790
I've been streaming for 10 plus hours.

11012
10:28:42,270 --> 10:28:45,010
Do you want to keep the VOD or not?

11013
10:28:45,010 --> 10:28:47,310
I can't believe you won't play this song.

11014
10:28:48,030 --> 10:28:50,970
I'll play this song if you'll stay for another hour.

11015
10:28:55,570 --> 10:28:56,730
Oh my god.

11016
10:28:56,770 --> 10:28:58,110
What the fuck happened to this guy?

11017
10:29:04,430 --> 10:29:06,110
Wait, there's a guy right here.

11018
10:29:17,790 --> 10:29:19,130
Oh my god.

11019
10:29:20,650 --> 10:29:21,230
Jesus Christ.

11020
10:29:21,230 --> 10:29:23,610
I'm just going to get stuck on some random shit.

11021
10:29:31,130 --> 10:29:32,430
Oh my god.

11022
10:29:33,990 --> 10:29:35,250
Things are very rough.

11023
10:29:36,110 --> 10:29:37,590
That's fucking life, isn't it?

11024
10:29:45,710 --> 10:29:46,950
We got two kills though.

11025
10:29:47,110 --> 10:29:47,510
Let's go.

11026
10:29:47,590 --> 10:29:49,310
Oh my god, we got three kills.

11027
10:29:49,490 --> 10:29:50,390
Is it my birthday?

11028
10:29:53,910 --> 10:29:55,730
None of us went to the checkpoint.

11029
10:29:56,670 --> 10:29:58,350
None of us went to the checkpoint.

11030
10:30:10,180 --> 10:30:12,360
Yeah, why are we just sitting there?

11031
10:30:14,060 --> 10:30:15,380
That's the guy that won't lose it.

11032
10:30:16,600 --> 10:30:17,360
That won it what?

11033
10:30:17,860 --> 10:30:18,820
Won't lose it.

11034
10:30:19,440 --> 10:30:19,960
Oh.

11035
10:30:27,490 --> 10:30:29,110
I'm just...

11036
10:30:29,110 --> 10:30:30,430
Let's dance.

11037
10:30:31,450 --> 10:30:34,590
Let's just keep dancing, I guess.

11038
10:30:35,550 --> 10:30:36,630
Let's just...

11039
10:30:36,630 --> 10:30:37,210
Yeah.

11040
10:30:38,530 --> 10:30:40,270
Let's just keep dancing.

11041
10:30:41,770 --> 10:30:43,250
Oh my god.

11042
10:30:44,750 --> 10:30:45,610
I'm bored.

11043
10:30:46,500 --> 10:30:47,890
Oh, he jumped off.

11044
10:30:48,460 --> 10:30:50,330
He jumped off.

11045
10:30:55,650 --> 10:30:56,700
Oh, he's dead.

11046
10:30:57,140 --> 10:30:58,660
Oh, I'm dead too.

11047
10:30:59,200 --> 10:31:01,800
Unless I start skating.

11048
10:31:05,100 --> 10:31:06,140
Such is life.

11049
10:31:07,790 --> 10:31:08,160
Alright.

11050
10:31:10,500 --> 10:31:12,520
I don't think Brex is okay.

11051
10:31:13,840 --> 10:31:15,220
I don't think this guy is okay.

11052
10:31:15,220 --> 10:31:16,660
He's on a 10 loss streak.

11053
10:31:17,300 --> 10:31:19,340
That's like worse than what I've been going through.

11054
10:31:34,540 --> 10:31:35,320
You're fine.

11055
10:31:35,560 --> 10:31:36,220
Oh, never mind.

11056
10:31:36,280 --> 10:31:36,820
You're not fine.

11057
10:31:40,860 --> 10:31:42,400
Oh, you're so fine.

11058
10:31:43,120 --> 10:31:44,500
No, I'm chillin'.

11059
10:31:44,500 --> 10:31:46,340
You're so chillin'.

11060
10:31:49,080 --> 10:31:49,840
Like, Niels won?

11061
10:31:51,520 --> 10:31:52,860
Oh, shit.

11062
10:31:55,020 --> 10:31:56,140
Oh, shit.

11063
10:31:56,240 --> 10:31:56,500
Okay.

11064
10:31:56,500 --> 10:31:58,440
Who did he kill to get an...

11065
10:31:58,440 --> 10:31:59,340
Oh, yeah, the low key.

11066
10:31:59,840 --> 10:32:00,940
We have low key.

11067
10:32:08,600 --> 10:32:09,480
Oh, that's...

11068
10:32:09,480 --> 10:32:10,120
very unfortunate.

11069
10:32:10,780 --> 10:32:12,660
I got stuck on a random fuckin' tree.

11070
10:32:14,100 --> 10:32:14,540
What

11071
10:32:19,360 --> 10:32:20,080
hit me?

11072
10:32:21,980 --> 10:32:23,240
I thought she got...

11073
10:32:23,820 --> 10:32:25,640
She got like...

11074
10:32:25,640 --> 10:32:27,440
She got stunned, but then she got unstunned.

11075
10:32:28,080 --> 10:32:30,280
Yeah, but on my screen, she was still stunned.

11076
10:32:32,720 --> 10:32:34,200
That's why I was like, what?

11077
10:32:45,400 --> 10:32:46,240
No.

11078
10:32:46,500 --> 10:32:46,820
No.

11079
10:32:47,280 --> 10:32:47,840
No.

11080
10:32:48,200 --> 10:32:50,080
You're not getting me.

11081
10:32:59,620 --> 10:33:00,060
Alright.

11082
10:33:00,620 --> 10:33:01,300
Worth it.

11083
10:33:04,240 --> 10:33:04,720
Alright.

11084
10:33:14,800 --> 10:33:15,660
Oh my god.

11085
10:33:18,780 --> 10:33:20,820
Why is it always a show?

11086
10:33:29,660 --> 10:33:31,920
This is the longest fight.

11087
10:33:36,000 --> 10:33:37,920
There's a Magneto to our left.

11088
10:33:41,220 --> 10:33:41,740
What?

11089
10:33:46,910 --> 10:33:48,570
There's a Moon Knight to our left.

11090
10:33:51,310 --> 10:33:52,910
And a Hela to our left, too.

11091
10:33:53,810 --> 10:33:55,930
I was trying to kill the Hela, but she's a rat shit.

11092
10:33:59,920 --> 10:34:01,340
Oh, this Hela!

11093
10:34:01,920 --> 10:34:02,660
This Hela!

11094
10:34:03,380 --> 10:34:05,580
I got 2v1'd by the Magneto and Hela.

11095
10:34:10,670 --> 10:34:12,470
Bro, this Hela...

11096
10:34:12,470 --> 10:34:14,070
has been fucking it.

11097
10:34:14,070 --> 10:34:15,830
Oh my god, the bane of our existence.

11098
10:34:21,980 --> 10:34:24,240
Oh my god, I'm scared of this Hela, guys.

11099
10:34:27,340 --> 10:34:28,880
I think they're capping that.

11100
10:34:29,040 --> 10:34:29,240
Yeah.

11101
10:34:29,960 --> 10:34:31,360
Why do they always get the Magneto?

11102
10:34:33,060 --> 10:34:33,500
Woah!

11103
10:34:33,700 --> 10:34:35,180
That's where I get Moon, too.

11104
10:34:39,360 --> 10:34:42,780
Just ask the Penny Parker very nicely to swap.

11105
10:34:44,600 --> 10:34:45,640
They're not going to.

11106
10:34:46,840 --> 10:34:47,920
You don't know that.

11107
10:34:48,200 --> 10:34:49,960
Remember the last time you said that?

11108
10:34:54,620 --> 10:34:56,040
Remember the last time you said that?

11109
10:34:56,180 --> 10:34:57,640
And then, like, you know...

11110
10:35:01,200 --> 10:35:02,560
This is my first...

11111
10:35:02,560 --> 10:35:06,480
I think he's actually fucking mind-broken.

11112
10:35:08,180 --> 10:35:09,600
Yeah, that's fucking life, isn't it?

11113
10:35:09,600 --> 10:35:12,420
That's why you're losing 10 games in a row, and you're being shut out right now.

11114
10:35:13,740 --> 10:35:14,320
I don't know.

11115
10:35:16,460 --> 10:35:17,340
Holy shit!

11116
10:35:18,600 --> 10:35:19,480
Holy shit!

11117
10:35:21,000 --> 10:35:22,520
Un-fucking-believable, bro.

11118
10:35:25,840 --> 10:35:26,960
I can't kill this guy.

11119
10:35:27,040 --> 10:35:27,820
He's getting pocketed.

11120
10:35:29,800 --> 10:35:31,360
I had an orb on you.

11121
10:35:31,580 --> 10:35:32,920
I don't know what you want.

11122
10:35:34,360 --> 10:35:35,760
But he's getting Jeff-pocketed.

11123
10:35:37,260 --> 10:35:38,140
Jeff-pocketed?

11124
10:35:44,640 --> 10:35:45,280
Bro...

11125
10:35:45,280 --> 10:35:45,780
I'm...

11126
10:35:45,780 --> 10:35:48,040
I didn't see the Magneto.

11127
10:35:48,140 --> 10:35:49,780
There were two Penny Parker webs.

11128
10:35:50,080 --> 10:35:52,320
I couldn't tell where things were.

11129
10:35:52,820 --> 10:35:55,400
There are so many Penny Parker webs.

11130
10:35:57,660 --> 10:35:58,180
Moonable.

11131
10:36:06,400 --> 10:36:07,360
Oh, no.

11132
10:36:07,640 --> 10:36:07,920
No.

11133
10:36:08,280 --> 10:36:08,480
No!

11134
10:36:09,280 --> 10:36:10,160
I'm bored.

11135
10:36:10,640 --> 10:36:11,080
Me, too.

11136
10:36:11,300 --> 10:36:11,980
We're in the Vortex.

11137
10:36:13,320 --> 10:36:14,560
And he jumps off.

11138
10:36:14,780 --> 10:36:16,260
Of course, this fucker.

11139
10:36:20,060 --> 10:36:20,640
It's fine.

11140
10:36:20,900 --> 10:36:21,720
We still have the other support.

11141
10:36:23,400 --> 10:36:26,140
I just hope the other support is healing him.

11142
10:36:53,820 --> 10:36:55,500
I can't help you guys up top.

11143
10:37:00,300 --> 10:37:02,520
Bitch actually getting hard-pocketed by Jeff.

11144
10:37:02,620 --> 10:37:03,620
What the fuck, man?

11145
10:37:05,760 --> 10:37:06,140
That's fine.

11146
10:37:06,180 --> 10:37:06,740
We killed him.

11147
10:37:12,620 --> 10:37:14,600
Oh, my God!

11148
10:37:23,720 --> 10:37:24,360
Venom!

11149
10:37:24,980 --> 10:37:27,760
Why is he asking about Venom or Squirrel Girl?

11150
10:37:32,480 --> 10:37:32,940
Hey, look.

11151
10:37:32,960 --> 10:37:33,840
He asked nicely.

11152
10:37:36,420 --> 10:37:38,740
You think he actually plays Squirrel Girl?

11153
10:37:39,600 --> 10:37:40,260
Nah.

11154
10:37:41,700 --> 10:37:42,200
You think?

11155
10:37:43,120 --> 10:37:46,760
You think he actually knows how to play her?

11156
10:37:47,520 --> 10:37:47,960
Nah.

11157
10:37:48,880 --> 10:37:50,420
Why don't you believe in them?

11158
10:37:51,140 --> 10:37:52,660
I don't believe in humans.

11159
10:37:53,240 --> 10:37:54,460
I believe in myself.

11160
10:37:55,700 --> 10:37:57,480
You don't believe in anybody?

11161
10:37:58,550 --> 10:37:58,880
No.

11162
10:37:59,640 --> 10:38:00,620
Who hurt you?

11163
10:38:01,460 --> 10:38:01,980
God.

11164
10:38:02,580 --> 10:38:06,860
What did God do to you?

11165
10:38:06,860 --> 10:38:08,380
He didn't make cat girls real.

11166
10:38:12,960 --> 10:38:16,820
But if you fuck a cat girl, isn't that... aren't you a furry?

11167
10:38:17,440 --> 10:38:18,000
No.

11168
10:38:18,260 --> 10:38:20,220
It's not furry if it's only ears and tail.

11169
10:38:20,820 --> 10:38:23,020
But they have cat characteristics.

11170
10:38:24,060 --> 10:38:24,440
No.

11171
10:38:24,800 --> 10:38:28,180
It's a human with cat ears and a tail.

11172
10:38:28,540 --> 10:38:30,560
That means you have an attraction to cats.

11173
10:38:30,880 --> 10:38:31,320
No.

11174
10:38:31,840 --> 10:38:35,860
I have an attraction to aesthetically pleasing things.

11175
10:38:36,260 --> 10:38:38,680
So cats are aesthetically pleasing?

11176
10:38:39,260 --> 10:38:42,120
Women with cat ears and tails are aesthetically pleasing.

11177
10:38:42,180 --> 10:38:45,260
What's the difference between that and a regular cat?

11178
10:38:45,700 --> 10:38:47,240
Because I don't want to fuck a cat.

11179
10:38:47,860 --> 10:38:48,840
Yeah, but like...

11180
10:38:50,780 --> 10:38:52,580
But it still is a cat.

11181
10:38:53,820 --> 10:38:54,160
No.

11182
10:38:59,420 --> 10:39:00,800
You just wouldn't fucking get it.

11183
10:39:02,060 --> 10:39:03,260
What do you mean?

11184
10:39:03,740 --> 10:39:05,640
You don't even explain it.

11185
10:39:05,640 --> 10:39:07,920
I don't explain it so that I could get it.

11186
10:39:07,940 --> 10:39:09,380
I can't explain it because you don't listen.

11187
10:39:09,700 --> 10:39:11,220
I'm listening, I'm listening.

11188
10:39:11,780 --> 10:39:12,480
You don't listen.

11189
10:39:12,700 --> 10:39:14,100
I'm listening right now.

11190
10:39:14,340 --> 10:39:15,800
That's your problem, you don't listen.

11191
10:39:16,380 --> 10:39:18,620
Oh my god, look, you died because...

11192
10:39:18,620 --> 10:39:20,780
you died because you weren't listening.

11193
10:39:27,440 --> 10:39:29,620
Spider-Man's going spider mode.

11194
10:39:30,660 --> 10:39:31,200
Oh shit.

11195
10:39:31,320 --> 10:39:33,460
He really said, it's sticky time.

11196
10:39:34,560 --> 10:39:35,320
He's what?

11197
10:39:38,860 --> 10:39:40,360
Oh shit, that guy fucking died.

11198
10:39:40,360 --> 10:39:43,720
It fucking has to be duo'd with this death, Jeff.

11199
10:39:43,940 --> 10:39:44,320
Why?

11200
10:39:45,140 --> 10:39:48,900
Dude, he's fucking squirting on that bitch like his life depends on it.

11201
10:39:55,860 --> 10:40:01,180
Okay, but like Jeff is the weirdest character to fucking use as a pocket.

11202
10:40:01,180 --> 10:40:02,420
Jeff fucking pumps.

11203
10:40:04,680 --> 10:40:06,540
Oh my god, oh my god.

11204
10:40:06,540 --> 10:40:08,600
What was the plan for that guy though?

11205
10:40:09,120 --> 10:40:10,600
He's like flanking or some shit.

11206
10:40:10,940 --> 10:40:12,360
I want to cap this.

11207
10:40:14,180 --> 10:40:16,120
Okay, the Magneto fucking...

11208
10:40:16,120 --> 10:40:18,540
Okay, we're not capping this, I don't think we're capping this.

11209
10:40:19,680 --> 10:40:20,670
This Magneto has...

11210
10:40:23,260 --> 10:40:24,420
Bro, how?

11211
10:40:26,060 --> 10:40:29,520
The Magneto, please, the Magneto solo, please!

11212
10:40:31,260 --> 10:40:32,340
Bro, shit!

11213
10:40:32,440 --> 10:40:33,780
I get another egg!

11214
10:40:33,780 --> 10:40:35,380
Okay.

11215
10:40:35,380 --> 10:40:36,300
Are you serious?

11216
10:40:36,780 --> 10:40:38,940
We just need to shoot the Magneto!

11217
10:40:40,820 --> 10:40:43,880
And then he went hella mode!

11218
10:40:48,110 --> 10:40:49,070
Okay.

11219
10:40:51,690 --> 10:40:53,190
Coming back.

11220
10:40:54,870 --> 10:40:56,250
Oh my god.

11221
10:40:59,890 --> 10:41:01,590
I can't keep healing this.

11222
10:41:07,970 --> 10:41:08,930
Okay.

11223
10:41:12,390 --> 10:41:13,590
Where the fuck did they come from?

11224
10:41:13,590 --> 10:41:14,490
I couldn't heal that.

11225
10:41:20,260 --> 10:41:23,840
Oh my god, I turned around just as she fucking birded.

11226
10:41:27,950 --> 10:41:29,590
I'm putting it on the Spider-Man.

11227
10:41:29,670 --> 10:41:31,130
The Spider-Man is having...

11228
10:41:31,130 --> 10:41:32,650
He's just fucking running around.

11229
10:41:35,890 --> 10:41:37,410
I can barely heal.

11230
10:41:39,950 --> 10:41:42,150
The Spider-Man needs to fucking stop.

11231
10:41:48,880 --> 10:41:49,440
Okay.

11232
10:41:49,440 --> 10:41:49,500
Okay.

11233
10:41:51,220 --> 10:41:52,680
What happened to him?

11234
10:41:53,380 --> 10:41:54,440
He just held it.

11235
10:41:54,620 --> 10:41:56,100
Get the Magneto, please, he's actually one.

11236
10:41:56,640 --> 10:41:57,800
The Magneto's actually one.

11237
10:42:07,050 --> 10:42:09,450
No, I was at the edge of that.

11238
10:42:09,530 --> 10:42:10,330
You have no supports.

11239
10:42:11,190 --> 10:42:12,690
Oh wait, you have Loki.

11240
10:42:17,660 --> 10:42:21,100
My god, if we had anything but a fucking Loki, man.

11241
10:42:21,100 --> 10:42:22,040
Oh my god.

11242
10:42:23,380 --> 10:42:27,060
I'm sitting right beside this guy and he's just DPSing.

11243
10:42:34,460 --> 10:42:37,060
Can any of us touch it?

11244
10:42:37,860 --> 10:42:41,260
I'm on it putting a show right now.

11245
10:42:42,300 --> 10:42:43,100
Dancing.

11246
10:42:48,780 --> 10:42:49,580
No.

11247
10:42:57,980 --> 10:42:59,640
Let's Wimble.

11248
10:42:59,900 --> 10:43:02,120
Please, we...

11249
10:43:02,120 --> 10:43:04,340
We just...

11250
10:43:04,340 --> 10:43:07,500
We just need...

11251
10:43:08,860 --> 10:43:11,820
Please just kill him.

11252
10:43:12,060 --> 10:43:14,200
The fucking Magneto.

11253
10:43:15,080 --> 10:43:16,500
Magneto never dies.

11254
10:43:17,080 --> 10:43:19,740
Magneto doesn't die.

11255
10:43:20,580 --> 10:43:20,980
I'm gonna Wimble.

11256
10:43:30,830 --> 10:43:32,290
Oh my god.

11257
10:43:33,570 --> 10:43:36,810
He literally just let Magneto just live.

11258
10:43:37,370 --> 10:43:38,690
For 20 years.

11259
10:43:39,870 --> 10:43:41,130
That's fucking life, isn't it?

11260
10:43:48,060 --> 10:43:50,220
God, I fucking hate healing this fucker.

11261
10:43:51,740 --> 10:43:53,440
He just jumps everywhere.

11262
10:43:55,720 --> 10:43:56,320
It's...

11263
10:43:56,320 --> 10:43:57,600
Oh my god, I wanna...

11264
10:43:57,600 --> 10:43:59,740
Makes me wanna go outside and find a spider and squish him.

11265
10:43:59,740 --> 10:44:01,820
I am ready to put on a show.

11266
10:44:24,290 --> 10:44:25,530
I got you.

11267
10:44:26,090 --> 10:44:26,950
Thank you.

11268
10:44:27,530 --> 10:44:29,610
Our fucking Spider-Man's finally squashed.

11269
10:44:35,500 --> 10:44:38,180
Oh my god, she...

11270
10:44:38,180 --> 10:44:41,520
I hit her once and the fucking Jeff just squirts.

11271
10:44:42,860 --> 10:44:45,440
It can't always just be Jeff.

11272
10:44:48,640 --> 10:44:50,800
Oh my god, I have to use it.

11273
10:44:51,700 --> 10:44:52,600
Or I'll die.

11274
10:44:52,600 --> 10:44:55,880
Because the Loki was not healing me at all.

11275
10:44:57,580 --> 10:44:59,180
I'm using DPS.

11276
10:44:59,680 --> 10:45:00,960
I'm damage boosting.

11277
10:45:01,100 --> 10:45:02,100
Just kill everything.

11278
10:45:07,780 --> 10:45:09,840
Oh my god, we reached the checkpoint.

11279
10:45:10,940 --> 10:45:12,160
Isn't that crazy?

11280
10:45:14,060 --> 10:45:16,560
Yeah, Spider-Man's been killing the hell out of this clutch.

11281
10:45:19,300 --> 10:45:20,880
He knows what he's doing.

11282
10:45:22,180 --> 10:45:23,840
Our Loki is...

11283
10:45:24,660 --> 10:45:26,380
MVP right now, by the way.

11284
10:45:26,600 --> 10:45:27,560
How does that make you feel?

11285
10:45:28,380 --> 10:45:29,480
Makes me feel mad.

11286
10:45:30,300 --> 10:45:31,200
How mad though?

11287
10:45:31,440 --> 10:45:34,180
No, I swear to god, please get me out.

11288
10:45:34,180 --> 10:45:34,480
I'm bored.

11289
10:45:35,360 --> 10:45:37,060
Get me, let me die.

11290
10:45:43,080 --> 10:45:44,160
Please, stop.

11291
10:45:46,540 --> 10:45:47,080
Stop.

11292
10:45:49,940 --> 10:45:52,080
I wish I'd know who's talking.

11293
10:45:54,040 --> 10:45:55,160
It's like someone.

11294
10:45:56,440 --> 10:45:58,780
I still don't understand how that's not fixed yet.

11295
10:46:15,760 --> 10:46:17,780
I can't see you guys.

11296
10:46:20,180 --> 10:46:21,400
Because there's a...

11297
10:46:21,400 --> 10:46:22,860
There's a Venom behind us.

11298
10:46:22,920 --> 10:46:24,720
He used his heal thing.

11299
10:46:26,160 --> 10:46:27,300
Oh, he got away.

11300
10:46:29,460 --> 10:46:30,420
I'm watching you.

11301
10:46:30,460 --> 10:46:31,760
I'm watching you trying to kill him.

11302
10:46:32,080 --> 10:46:32,660
Did you get him?

11303
10:46:33,400 --> 10:46:34,600
I got him.

11304
10:46:39,840 --> 10:46:41,220
Alright, we have one fight left.

11305
10:46:50,540 --> 10:46:52,260
I don't know if I can grab my ult in time.

11306
10:46:56,650 --> 10:46:59,050
Oh my god, I need heals, please.

11307
10:46:59,790 --> 10:47:00,150
Where?

11308
10:47:00,490 --> 10:47:01,310
What the fuck?

11309
10:47:01,370 --> 10:47:02,910
You were in the air, I didn't know where you were.

11310
10:47:03,570 --> 10:47:06,030
Yeah, I had to fucking crow so I don't die.

11311
10:47:13,740 --> 10:47:16,140
I don't know if I can grab my ult in time though, that's the thing.

11312
10:47:16,140 --> 10:47:16,180
Oh my god.

11313
10:47:16,240 --> 10:47:20,480
Oh no, not that ult.

11314
10:47:21,880 --> 10:47:22,500
I can't!

11315
10:47:22,560 --> 10:47:23,000
I'm catching through!

11316
10:47:23,000 --> 10:47:24,900
We see nine!

11317
10:47:27,180 --> 10:47:27,800
Guys,

11318
10:47:30,920 --> 10:47:33,140
I think I deranked to plat 3 from that.

11319
10:47:34,140 --> 10:47:34,760
Yippee!

11320
10:47:35,160 --> 10:47:37,840
I think I got deranked.

11321
10:47:40,540 --> 10:47:41,720
There's no...

11322
10:47:41,720 --> 10:47:45,480
Oh my god, I think I actually deranked from that.

11323
10:47:48,200 --> 10:47:49,640
Oh no, I'm safe.

11324
10:47:49,920 --> 10:47:51,040
Anyway, you wanna go again?

11325
10:47:52,220 --> 10:47:53,140
I'm fucking done.

11326
10:47:54,640 --> 10:47:55,600
You're done?!

11327
10:47:55,600 --> 10:47:57,960
Yeah, it's fucking bedtime, it's 6am.

11328
10:47:58,120 --> 10:47:59,320
Oh no, it's your bedtime.

11329
10:47:59,320 --> 10:48:00,060
This is curfew.

11330
10:48:00,080 --> 10:48:04,040
Your curfew, the sun is out.

11331
10:48:04,260 --> 10:48:05,860
Alright, gg's man, gg.

11332
10:48:06,160 --> 10:48:07,180
I don't think the sun's out yet.

11333
10:48:07,500 --> 10:48:08,080
Is it not?

11334
10:48:08,160 --> 10:48:09,020
It's 6 in the morning.

11335
10:48:09,580 --> 10:48:11,520
It's like encroaching or some shit.

11336
10:48:11,920 --> 10:48:13,200
Alright, gg's though.

11337
10:48:13,200 --> 10:48:14,540
Those were fun games.

11338
10:48:15,060 --> 10:48:16,120
I hope you suffer.

11339
10:48:16,760 --> 10:48:17,140
What?!

11340
10:48:17,140 --> 10:48:18,340
Why would you say that?

11341
10:48:19,000 --> 10:48:21,400
Because Curse of Ra and Loser's Key was funny.

11342
10:48:21,900 --> 10:48:23,700
No, come on, come on.

11343
10:48:23,780 --> 10:48:25,980
That's not fair, you get to be top 500.

11344
10:48:26,080 --> 10:48:28,240
You look at my chat, you know what they say.

11345
10:48:28,460 --> 10:48:29,880
They pray for that shit all the time.

11346
10:48:30,000 --> 10:48:32,100
Yeah, but that's not true, that's the environment you created.

11347
10:48:32,100 --> 10:48:33,800
You say noob down whenever you can.

11348
10:48:33,820 --> 10:48:34,220
That's the environment you created.

11349
10:48:34,220 --> 10:48:35,680
You're not supportive at all.

11350
10:48:37,180 --> 10:48:40,120
Half the time you type, it's to say noob down.

11351
10:48:40,300 --> 10:48:41,640
That's not true, I said that one time.

11352
10:48:41,640 --> 10:48:42,160
That's true.

11353
10:48:43,660 --> 10:48:45,420
You want me to pull up your logs?

11354
10:48:45,580 --> 10:48:47,160
I'll pull up your logs right now.

11355
10:48:47,340 --> 10:48:49,380
I literally said that once in your chat.

11356
10:48:49,520 --> 10:48:50,620
Pull up the fucking logs.

11357
10:48:52,140 --> 10:48:53,540
Yeah, pull it up right now.

11358
10:48:53,640 --> 10:48:55,380
I know I said it only once.

11359
10:48:59,060 --> 10:49:00,360
Well, you said...

11360
10:49:01,120 --> 10:49:01,920
lol silver.

11361
10:49:03,500 --> 10:49:04,720
Yeah, I remember that.

11362
10:49:04,940 --> 10:49:06,940
Is it team ranking or is it still quick play?

11363
10:49:12,410 --> 10:49:13,610
Welcome to silver.

11364
10:49:16,310 --> 10:49:19,310
Put the VTuber model on for the full experience.

11365
10:49:23,200 --> 10:49:26,220
Then you're shit-talking me for playing voice of the void.

11366
10:49:30,290 --> 10:49:31,770
Yeah, where's noob down?

11367
10:49:31,970 --> 10:49:32,710
Where is it?

11368
10:49:33,190 --> 10:49:34,430
You've said it somewhere.

11369
10:49:34,710 --> 10:49:35,490
Where is it?

11370
10:49:36,730 --> 10:49:39,010
It's on the deadname account.

11371
10:49:42,550 --> 10:49:45,030
That was fucking so long ago!

11372
10:49:45,190 --> 10:49:45,970
I told you!

11373
10:49:45,970 --> 10:49:47,730
It still fucking counts.

11374
10:49:47,730 --> 10:49:50,050
It still fucking counts.

11375
10:49:50,230 --> 10:49:51,790
No, it doesn't!

11376
10:49:51,870 --> 10:49:54,130
I told you I didn't say it!

11377
10:49:54,370 --> 10:49:55,770
I didn't say I'm Doki Bird.

11378
10:49:55,950 --> 10:49:56,870
I didn't say it.

11379
10:49:57,050 --> 10:49:58,610
I didn't say it.

11380
10:49:58,850 --> 10:50:01,630
Yeah, I won that argument.

11381
10:50:03,290 --> 10:50:04,090
It wasn't an argument.

11382
10:50:04,730 --> 10:50:05,690
I won the argument.

11383
10:50:07,690 --> 10:50:09,490
Curse of Ra, I hope you lose everything.

11384
10:50:09,870 --> 10:50:11,250
You're going back to gold.

11385
10:50:11,590 --> 10:50:12,550
You're going down to gold.

11386
10:50:12,550 --> 10:50:14,830
You're going to fucking gold.

11387
10:50:16,530 --> 10:50:19,710
Yeah, if you play early.

11388
10:50:19,830 --> 10:50:21,990
Because I have to start stream at 2pm.

11389
10:50:22,270 --> 10:50:23,610
Yeah, start stream at 2pm.

11390
10:50:24,730 --> 10:50:26,810
You know what they fucking said to me?

11391
10:50:27,270 --> 10:50:39,150
My manager said these fucking bum-ass streamers were so late on their start times that they had to say I have to start early and they're forcing people to start their streams early for the sponsor.

11392
10:50:39,150 --> 10:50:42,930
I have to start early for these bum-asses, man.

11393
10:50:43,610 --> 10:50:44,730
Wait, are you...

11394
10:50:44,730 --> 10:50:47,430
Wait, you're streaming a sponsor at 2pm?

11395
10:50:48,070 --> 10:50:48,350
Yeah.

11396
10:50:48,890 --> 10:50:51,810
Okay, so how early are we Marvel rivaling?

11397
10:50:52,330 --> 10:50:54,650
No, Marvel's Rivals is the sponsor.

11398
10:50:55,030 --> 10:51:00,910
Wait, you got sponsored to play Marvel Rivals when you were already playing Marvel Rivals?

11399
10:51:01,230 --> 10:51:06,730
Well, it was supposed to happen earlier but then the streamers that are always late ruined everything.

11400
10:51:09,930 --> 10:51:11,320
Alright, I'll see you at 2pm.

11401
10:51:11,710 --> 10:51:12,390
Your time, right?

11402
10:51:13,170 --> 10:51:13,530
Yeah.

11403
10:51:13,810 --> 10:51:14,570
Okay, yeah.

11404
10:51:14,630 --> 10:51:15,410
I'll see you at 2pm.

11405
10:51:15,510 --> 10:51:16,070
Your time.

11406
10:51:16,690 --> 10:51:17,450
Good luck.

11407
10:51:17,730 --> 10:51:18,190
Godspeed.

11408
10:51:18,330 --> 10:51:19,070
What do you mean good luck?

11409
10:51:20,250 --> 10:51:22,030
We're going to be losing together.

11410
10:51:22,430 --> 10:51:24,110
No, aren't you going to keep playing right now?

11411
10:51:24,250 --> 10:51:26,030
No, I'm fucking calling it here!

11412
10:51:26,330 --> 10:51:27,410
What are you, a pussy?

11413
10:51:27,730 --> 10:51:30,470
I am not going to get top 500 today!

11414
10:51:30,470 --> 10:51:31,650
Fucking solo queue!

11415
10:51:31,870 --> 10:51:32,610
Believe in yourself!

11416
10:51:32,650 --> 10:51:35,010
I solo queued and then I got 3...

11417
10:51:35,010 --> 10:51:36,450
I kept getting support mains.

11418
10:51:36,450 --> 10:51:38,570
You'll play for another hour, right?

11419
10:51:38,630 --> 10:51:39,670
And you're going to quit?

11420
10:51:40,090 --> 10:51:40,730
Yeah, you quit.

11421
10:51:41,350 --> 10:51:42,370
I didn't quit.

11422
10:51:42,470 --> 10:51:42,910
Yes, you did.

11423
10:51:43,050 --> 10:51:43,630
You literally quit.

11424
10:51:44,170 --> 10:51:44,970
Yeah, you quit.

11425
10:51:45,150 --> 10:51:46,430
Or I'm queuing up.

11426
10:51:47,610 --> 10:51:48,530
I'm alt-f4ing.

11427
10:51:49,510 --> 10:51:50,350
You quit!

11428
10:51:50,930 --> 10:51:51,810
That's not quitting.

11429
10:51:52,710 --> 10:51:54,130
Alt-f4ing is quitting.

11430
10:51:54,470 --> 10:51:55,850
Not true, not true.

11431
10:51:55,870 --> 10:51:56,550
Yes, it is.

11432
10:51:56,610 --> 10:51:58,070
You're literally quitting the game.

11433
10:51:58,610 --> 10:52:00,070
Yeah, I'm quitting the game.

11434
10:52:00,410 --> 10:52:01,490
Yeah, that means you're quitting.

11435
10:52:02,030 --> 10:52:02,870
Yeah, you're quitting.

11436
10:52:03,290 --> 10:52:04,230
No, you're quitting.

11437
10:52:04,750 --> 10:52:06,090
Not top 500.

11438
10:52:08,790 --> 10:52:10,010
Whose fault is that?

11439
10:52:10,030 --> 10:52:10,770
It's not my fault.

11440
10:52:11,130 --> 10:52:13,550
Yeah, you were going to say, whose fault is that?

11441
10:52:13,710 --> 10:52:17,910
You were going to try to bring me into it, when you're the one that lost it, without me.

11442
10:52:18,470 --> 10:52:19,910
It's not my fault.

11443
10:52:20,310 --> 10:52:22,070
It's not my fault.

11444
10:52:22,510 --> 10:52:23,330
The queues...

11445
10:52:23,330 --> 10:52:25,290
The queues fucked me over.

11446
10:52:26,330 --> 10:52:30,090
You tried to throw hands for a second there, and you caught yourself.

11447
10:52:30,370 --> 10:52:31,730
You caught yourself.

11448
10:52:34,230 --> 10:52:36,550
I actually got the worst RNG.

11449
10:52:37,190 --> 10:52:38,310
Yeah, I...

11450
10:52:38,310 --> 10:52:39,810
SK was the witness.

11451
10:52:40,230 --> 10:52:43,610
She experienced one of the queues I was going through.

11452
10:52:44,330 --> 10:52:45,590
You don't know pain.

11453
10:52:45,750 --> 10:52:47,550
I've stared into the void.

11454
10:52:48,890 --> 10:52:49,510
And I survived.

11455
10:52:52,690 --> 10:52:56,230
These Marvel Rivals games, they only last, like, what?

11456
10:52:56,530 --> 10:52:56,990
10 minutes?

11457
10:52:58,350 --> 10:53:01,630
League of Legends, you're stuck there for 25, 30 minutes.

11458
10:53:01,630 --> 10:53:04,170
With the pits of all of humanity.

11459
10:53:05,810 --> 10:53:07,050
Yeah, but that was a choice.

11460
10:53:08,270 --> 10:53:08,750
Yeah.

11461
10:53:09,010 --> 10:53:11,490
And I fucking went through it, and I became stronger.

11462
10:53:12,310 --> 10:53:18,390
I went from D1 promos, to Emerald 5, 0 LP, 3 losses, all the way to Masters.

11463
10:53:20,130 --> 10:53:21,690
How the fuck did you do that to yourself?

11464
10:53:22,590 --> 10:53:25,170
Because I have the mental of a god.

11465
10:53:26,130 --> 10:53:28,070
I thought you hated god.

11466
10:53:29,190 --> 10:53:31,250
Yeah, that's why I need to become god.

11467
10:53:31,390 --> 10:53:34,790
You need to become god to destroy what you hate.

11468
10:53:35,590 --> 10:53:36,070
Exactly.

11469
10:53:37,490 --> 10:53:38,790
Now you're understanding.

11470
10:53:43,040 --> 10:53:45,460
I guess I'll see you on Thursday then.

11471
10:53:45,460 --> 10:53:48,300
No, wait, I also have to...

11472
10:53:48,300 --> 10:53:50,740
Let me see, I need to get this for you.

11473
10:53:51,200 --> 10:53:51,680
What?

11474
10:53:52,900 --> 10:53:54,180
I'm finding it, don't worry.

11475
10:53:57,260 --> 10:53:58,640
This is the furry chart.

11476
10:53:58,640 --> 10:54:00,400
The what chart?

11477
10:54:01,080 --> 10:54:02,200
The furry chart, bro.

11478
10:54:03,040 --> 10:54:05,060
Oh, the furry chart!

11479
10:54:08,530 --> 10:54:09,210
Oh!

11480
10:54:09,930 --> 10:54:11,290
So this is your baseline.

11481
10:54:12,010 --> 10:54:13,690
No, I'm at Neko.

11482
10:54:14,070 --> 10:54:14,770
You're at Neko?

11483
10:54:15,410 --> 10:54:15,950
Yeah.

11484
10:54:18,050 --> 10:54:19,750
What's the animal structure?

11485
10:54:19,990 --> 10:54:20,810
It looks the same.

11486
10:54:21,670 --> 10:54:24,010
What's the difference between animal structure and Neko?

11487
10:54:25,050 --> 10:54:27,730
The borderline furry and Neko, what's the difference?

11488
10:54:27,730 --> 10:54:29,390
Because they got cat paws and shit.

11489
10:54:29,630 --> 10:54:30,750
You have cat paws?

11490
10:54:31,010 --> 10:54:33,530
So they have cat paws, you're like, that's out.

11491
10:54:34,050 --> 10:54:34,390
Yeah.

11492
10:54:34,970 --> 10:54:35,990
How would you know?

11493
10:54:36,830 --> 10:54:38,590
Because I can see their fucking hands.

11494
10:54:38,610 --> 10:54:41,350
Because I have fucking eyes.

11495
10:54:41,570 --> 10:54:42,290
How would you know?

11496
10:54:43,570 --> 10:54:44,910
You're out though.

11497
10:54:45,050 --> 10:54:47,270
You've never seen one with cat paws.

11498
10:54:49,570 --> 10:54:51,070
What if they wear gloves?

11499
10:54:52,470 --> 10:54:54,110
You can see through the gloves.

11500
10:54:54,170 --> 10:54:55,430
What if they wear gloves?

11501
10:54:55,430 --> 10:54:56,930
You can see through the gloves.

11502
10:54:56,930 --> 10:54:59,130
What if you only see the shoulder up?

11503
10:54:59,370 --> 10:55:00,690
And you didn't notice?

11504
10:55:01,310 --> 10:55:01,950
What do you mean?

11505
10:55:02,770 --> 10:55:04,890
What if you see from the shoulder up?

11506
10:55:05,310 --> 10:55:06,410
And then you're attracted to it.

11507
10:55:06,410 --> 10:55:09,690
If I'm going to have sex with it, I'm going to see the whole body at some point.

11508
10:55:09,770 --> 10:55:10,750
What the fuck do you mean?

11509
10:55:10,850 --> 10:55:12,150
Only the shoulder part.

11510
10:55:12,570 --> 10:55:16,070
I'm not trying to have sex with some VTuber that only shows their shoulders.

11511
10:55:16,170 --> 10:55:17,490
What the fuck are you saying?

11512
10:55:17,990 --> 10:55:20,970
I meant if you get attracted to it.

11513
10:55:21,290 --> 10:55:27,250
If you like shoulder up and then you like got attracted to it then wouldn't that make you a borderline furry?

11514
10:55:28,590 --> 10:55:29,070
What?

11515
10:55:30,550 --> 10:55:31,030
Yeah.

11516
10:55:31,510 --> 10:55:32,930
You're just making shit up.

11517
10:55:33,570 --> 10:55:35,870
Okay, you're saying that you're not attracted to furries.

11518
10:55:36,090 --> 10:55:37,930
But what if you only see the shoulder up?

11519
10:55:38,630 --> 10:55:41,190
Then you'd be a borderline furry because you can't see the paws.

11520
10:55:41,430 --> 10:55:42,270
That's not how that works.

11521
10:55:42,570 --> 10:55:44,010
How's that not how that works?

11522
10:55:44,250 --> 10:55:46,330
You're just waffling right now, you know that?

11523
10:55:47,050 --> 10:55:48,010
You're waffling.

11524
10:55:49,450 --> 10:55:50,750
I'm just saying.

11525
10:55:50,750 --> 10:55:53,390
You're just trying to make shit out of nothing.

11526
10:55:53,550 --> 10:55:54,630
No, I'm saying no.

11527
10:55:54,730 --> 10:55:55,810
Your brain is cooked.

11528
10:55:56,210 --> 10:55:56,770
It's fried.

11529
10:55:56,830 --> 10:56:02,210
You clearly are like if it has cat paws then what if you don't see the cat paws?

11530
10:56:03,070 --> 10:56:08,390
What if they were like those big gloves that hide the cat paws?

11531
10:56:08,610 --> 10:56:09,370
And you'll never know.

11532
10:56:09,950 --> 10:56:14,250
This kind of talk has happened on the internet forever.

11533
10:56:15,170 --> 10:56:15,470
Yeah?

11534
10:56:16,190 --> 10:56:16,710
Yeah.

11535
10:56:16,710 --> 10:56:18,170
Yeah, so?

11536
10:56:18,850 --> 10:56:20,050
What's that got to do with this?

11537
10:56:21,110 --> 10:56:22,150
You should know.

11538
10:56:22,490 --> 10:56:23,590
What I'm talking about.

11539
10:56:25,450 --> 10:56:26,990
What's that got to do with this?

11540
10:56:28,150 --> 10:56:29,310
You know Astolfo?

11541
10:56:30,010 --> 10:56:30,530
No.

11542
10:56:32,650 --> 10:56:33,690
What's Astolfo?

11543
10:56:36,410 --> 10:56:39,330
It's a correlation to the talk you're trying to represent right now.

11544
10:56:39,470 --> 10:56:40,770
What the fuck is Astolfo?

11545
10:56:41,030 --> 10:56:42,750
Wait, why is people saying oh no?

11546
10:56:43,770 --> 10:56:44,850
Because they know.

11547
10:56:44,850 --> 10:56:47,210
Wait, why are you saying stop right now?

11548
10:56:48,290 --> 10:56:48,930
They know.

11549
10:56:49,410 --> 10:56:49,890
Oh, sure.

11550
10:56:50,290 --> 10:56:50,650
Yeah.

11551
10:56:52,550 --> 10:56:53,950
Where am I going with this?

11552
10:56:54,350 --> 10:56:59,650
Because if you don't know then once you know is when you decide.

11553
10:57:00,210 --> 10:57:04,090
So if I see them and only see the face I'm like damn, they're hot.

11554
10:57:04,230 --> 10:57:07,030
But then they show their hands and I'm like damn, that's not hot.

11555
10:57:07,150 --> 10:57:07,730
I don't like you anymore.

11556
10:57:10,070 --> 10:57:11,930
So the hands aren't a deal?

11557
10:57:11,930 --> 10:57:12,950
Oh, that's fucked.

11558
10:57:13,090 --> 10:57:15,110
The hands aren't a deal breaker?

11559
10:57:16,770 --> 10:57:17,090
Yeah.

11560
10:57:18,250 --> 10:57:19,750
Man, that's pretty fucked.

11561
10:57:19,850 --> 10:57:21,770
I'm not trying to get paws on my shit, bro.

11562
10:57:26,690 --> 10:57:28,110
See, don't touch.

11563
10:57:36,790 --> 10:57:38,390
Ears and tail, that's the limit.

11564
10:57:39,690 --> 10:57:41,190
Ears and tails.

11565
10:57:41,590 --> 10:57:42,790
Because they're not real.

11566
10:57:42,790 --> 10:57:43,910
What have they become?

11567
10:57:44,090 --> 10:57:46,190
You don't know if they're not real?

11568
10:57:46,410 --> 10:57:47,390
They could be real.

11569
10:57:48,050 --> 10:57:49,050
What do you mean?

11570
10:57:49,330 --> 10:57:50,330
They could be real.

11571
10:57:52,490 --> 10:57:56,430
Maybe when you're 80 they make catgirls.

11572
10:57:57,370 --> 10:58:00,130
Dude, I'll be plugged in the fucking internet by then.

11573
10:58:00,230 --> 10:58:02,070
I'll be fucking whatever I want on the internet.

11574
10:58:02,570 --> 10:58:04,710
The world's gonna be my fucking oyster.

11575
10:58:05,190 --> 10:58:09,210
Elon Musk is gonna have the Neuralink fucking finish and I'm gonna be fucking jacked in.

11576
10:58:09,990 --> 10:58:11,030
Holy shit.

11577
10:58:14,210 --> 10:58:16,750
At that point you could have anything you want.

11578
10:58:17,050 --> 10:58:18,770
I could literally do whatever I want.

11579
10:58:18,870 --> 10:58:24,430
Dude, our fucking old person homes are gonna be fucking lit.

11580
10:58:24,650 --> 10:58:26,710
It's gonna be a LAN cafe every day.

11581
10:58:30,670 --> 10:58:35,470
And then technically you can live forever with your own in-house catgirl.

11582
10:58:35,950 --> 10:58:38,070
Okay, now that's the plot to Stalker.

11583
10:58:39,510 --> 10:58:41,310
That's the plot to Stalker?

11584
10:58:41,390 --> 10:58:43,010
Having your own in-house...

11585
10:58:43,010 --> 10:58:47,050
I thought you were gonna say something like uploading your consciousness to something.

11586
10:58:47,150 --> 10:58:48,170
Not the catgirl.

11587
10:58:48,210 --> 10:58:52,250
I'd be like, there's catgirls in Stalker?

11588
10:58:53,490 --> 10:58:54,450
There might be.

11589
10:58:55,990 --> 10:58:56,610
Oh yeah, you're not...

11590
10:58:56,610 --> 10:58:58,350
Wait, I thought you finished Stalker.

11591
10:58:58,970 --> 10:58:59,970
Yeah, I fucking did.

11592
10:59:00,090 --> 10:59:01,070
You didn't.

11593
10:59:01,130 --> 10:59:01,470
Yeah!

11594
10:59:02,330 --> 10:59:04,250
That game was way too long for a VTuber.

11595
10:59:04,250 --> 10:59:06,510
Yeah, but Marvel Rivals is different now.

11596
10:59:07,230 --> 10:59:09,890
You've worked like quadruple overtime today.

11597
10:59:10,030 --> 10:59:10,770
Yeah, I know.

11598
10:59:10,770 --> 10:59:12,270
I know, and I have a stream tomorrow.

11599
10:59:12,530 --> 10:59:14,950
Guys, I might change it to Marvel Rivals, guys.

11600
10:59:15,410 --> 10:59:15,790
I'm sorry.

11601
10:59:16,870 --> 10:59:18,990
You're gonna get on another lost streak?

11602
10:59:19,130 --> 10:59:20,410
No, I'm gonna win!

11603
10:59:20,950 --> 10:59:22,570
I've just gotten lucky!

11604
10:59:22,910 --> 10:59:23,950
I'm gonna win!

11605
10:59:24,770 --> 10:59:25,990
Let's do that match history.

11606
10:59:26,210 --> 10:59:27,730
No, don't do this to me.

11607
10:59:28,190 --> 10:59:30,170
Okay, but it's not my fault.

11608
10:59:31,230 --> 10:59:31,850
Ooh.

11609
10:59:32,330 --> 10:59:32,950
Ooh.

11610
10:59:34,330 --> 10:59:34,950
Ooh.

11611
10:59:36,430 --> 10:59:37,530
Wait, keep scrolling.

11612
10:59:37,750 --> 10:59:38,150
Whoa!

11613
10:59:39,670 --> 10:59:41,650
It was okay back then, but then...

11614
10:59:41,650 --> 10:59:42,050
Ooh.

11615
10:59:42,850 --> 10:59:45,290
Wait, when were all those victories, though?

11616
10:59:45,790 --> 10:59:46,410
Whoa!

11617
10:59:47,950 --> 10:59:48,630
Oh my god.

11618
10:59:52,310 --> 10:59:53,790
Who was in those games?

11619
10:59:55,170 --> 10:59:56,810
Well, I did some by myself.

11620
10:59:57,370 --> 10:59:58,490
Oh, shit.

11621
10:59:59,090 --> 11:00:00,710
Yeah, some of those wins were for me.

11622
11:00:02,050 --> 11:00:04,150
And then you tell when it stopped.

11623
11:00:05,070 --> 11:00:07,230
You can tell when things got bad.

11624
11:00:07,610 --> 11:00:10,290
You can tell exactly when things started getting bad.

11625
11:00:11,610 --> 11:00:12,130
Gulp.

11626
11:00:13,950 --> 11:00:17,350
All I'm saying is Catgirls are in Area 51.

11627
11:00:17,970 --> 11:00:18,970
I can turn it around.

11628
11:00:19,490 --> 11:00:22,110
They're hiding shit in there, 100%.

11629
11:00:22,110 --> 11:00:23,250
They're keeping it for themselves.

11630
11:00:24,670 --> 11:00:25,230
Wait, no.

11631
11:00:25,350 --> 11:00:26,650
You also helped me lost, too.

11632
11:00:26,790 --> 11:00:28,530
You were part of the losses, too.

11633
11:00:29,390 --> 11:00:30,950
You were part of the losses.

11634
11:00:31,890 --> 11:00:32,270
Not true.

11635
11:00:32,610 --> 11:00:33,210
Yes, you were.

11636
11:00:33,850 --> 11:00:34,210
When?

11637
11:00:35,130 --> 11:00:36,850
Like, literally last game.

11638
11:00:37,410 --> 11:00:38,650
And the game before that.

11639
11:00:39,270 --> 11:00:40,630
And the game before that.

11640
11:00:40,670 --> 11:00:42,870
The last three games, you were part of the...

11641
11:00:42,870 --> 11:00:47,210
The last three games, you were part of the lost streak.

11642
11:00:47,350 --> 11:00:48,410
Yeah, but I wasn't trying.

11643
11:00:48,590 --> 11:00:49,710
I'm nonchalant like that.

11644
11:00:49,790 --> 11:00:50,290
Oh, yeah.

11645
11:00:50,350 --> 11:00:54,190
Yeah, Mr. I swapped to Hawkeye because now I want to win.

11646
11:00:54,410 --> 11:00:58,930
My drive to win overpowers my drive to play Wolverine.

11647
11:00:59,230 --> 11:01:01,210
It's like a subconscious thing, you know?

11648
11:01:01,910 --> 11:01:07,330
My subconscious takes over, but I'm not consciously like you know, like type shit bro.

11649
11:01:09,270 --> 11:01:09,830
True.

11650
11:01:10,090 --> 11:01:10,430
Oh, yeah.

11651
11:01:10,550 --> 11:01:11,110
Yeah, sure.

11652
11:01:11,470 --> 11:01:12,070
Wait, guys.

11653
11:01:12,950 --> 11:01:18,390
Is the VOD 12 hours or 11 hours that it's supposed to end?

11654
11:01:18,390 --> 11:01:21,390
If it's 11 hours, then whoops.

11655
11:01:23,090 --> 11:01:24,430
What do you mean the whoops?

11656
11:01:24,810 --> 11:01:25,530
Oh, 12 hours.

11657
11:01:25,730 --> 11:01:31,730
In YouTube VODs, the reason why people don't do long streams on YouTube is that when it goes to 12 hours, the VOD cuts off.

11658
11:01:31,970 --> 11:01:33,510
And you gotta make a second stream.

11659
11:01:35,860 --> 11:01:36,300
What?

11660
11:01:36,700 --> 11:01:38,380
Yeah, that's the YouTube thing.

11661
11:01:38,880 --> 11:01:42,480
So, like, when it hits 12 hours, then the whole entire VOD cuts off.

11662
11:01:42,640 --> 11:01:45,400
So, like, everything is gone after 12 hours.

11663
11:01:45,620 --> 11:01:46,760
Or 11.55.

11664
11:01:47,660 --> 11:01:49,360
11 hours and 55 minutes.

11665
11:01:49,420 --> 11:01:50,420
Okay, we still, okay.

11666
11:01:51,080 --> 11:01:51,940
Alright, so we're safe.

11667
11:01:52,040 --> 11:01:52,960
This VOD is safe.

11668
11:01:54,340 --> 11:01:58,180
Well, like, wouldn't it, like, if you just stream like 30 minutes over, it doesn't matter.

11669
11:01:58,280 --> 11:01:59,320
They only lost like 30 minutes, right?

11670
11:01:59,320 --> 11:02:01,840
Yeah, they lost 30 minutes, but that's still losing content.

11671
11:02:04,000 --> 11:02:04,400
Content?

11672
11:02:04,840 --> 11:02:05,180
Yeah.

11673
11:02:06,420 --> 11:02:09,920
You should keep going and keep the content going with the long stream.

11674
11:02:10,100 --> 11:02:11,400
No, that's fine, sure.

11675
11:02:11,540 --> 11:02:12,280
That's fine.

11676
11:02:12,400 --> 11:02:13,000
I want to hit top 500.

11677
11:02:13,000 --> 11:02:13,860
No, that's real content.

11678
11:02:13,860 --> 11:02:15,080
People want that.

11679
11:02:15,100 --> 11:02:17,620
No, I want to hit top 500.

11680
11:02:17,900 --> 11:02:19,060
The people want me to win.

11681
11:02:19,400 --> 11:02:20,620
No, they don't.

11682
11:02:21,720 --> 11:02:24,660
You've created a hostile environment to yourself.

11683
11:02:24,660 --> 11:02:24,980
No, I haven't.

11684
11:02:25,200 --> 11:02:26,300
That's your own fault.

11685
11:02:26,620 --> 11:02:31,300
I created an actual environment that encourages me.

11686
11:02:32,040 --> 11:02:33,400
They don't encourage you.

11687
11:02:33,600 --> 11:02:34,260
They do.

11688
11:02:34,400 --> 11:02:35,200
Look at them right now.

11689
11:02:35,400 --> 11:02:36,940
They're like, go to bed.

11690
11:02:37,240 --> 11:02:38,800
I want her to win.

11691
11:02:40,240 --> 11:02:41,500
You guys are pussies.

11692
11:02:41,500 --> 11:02:42,780
I think pussies.

11693
11:02:43,060 --> 11:02:52,320
Oh, having a positive environment where my chat is encouraging me and everything.

11694
11:02:52,380 --> 11:02:53,340
You're just jealous.

11695
11:02:53,640 --> 11:02:54,960
You're just being coddled.

11696
11:02:55,120 --> 11:02:59,980
You're being coddled from the harsh realities of this world.

11697
11:03:02,680 --> 11:03:05,940
And one of the realities is not everyone gets to win.

11698
11:03:06,300 --> 11:03:09,940
Some people have to lose, so others can be winners.

11699
11:03:10,140 --> 11:03:11,700
But I'm one of the winners.

11700
11:03:12,100 --> 11:03:13,560
Not in your match history.

11701
11:03:14,680 --> 11:03:15,860
It's not even mine.

11702
11:03:15,960 --> 11:03:17,040
You're part of this.

11703
11:03:17,400 --> 11:03:19,120
You're part of this.

11704
11:03:20,560 --> 11:03:21,960
You're also a loser.

11705
11:03:22,740 --> 11:03:24,900
I'm just a chill guy playing a chill game.

11706
11:03:24,960 --> 11:03:25,660
You're also a loser.

11707
11:03:26,060 --> 11:03:28,100
No, I'm just a chill guy playing a chill game.

11708
11:03:28,120 --> 11:03:28,580
You're a loser too.

11709
11:03:29,000 --> 11:03:29,760
No, no, no.

11710
11:03:29,980 --> 11:03:30,540
Wait, wait.

11711
11:03:30,640 --> 11:03:32,960
Who's trying to get top 500 and who's not?

11712
11:03:33,840 --> 11:03:34,800
Oh, oh.

11713
11:03:35,080 --> 11:03:37,020
Yeah, you already got experience that.

11714
11:03:37,020 --> 11:03:38,980
You already got touch that one.

11715
11:03:39,160 --> 11:03:43,340
Like I can get top 500 and I'm just like a chill guy just moving my mouse every now and then.

11716
11:03:43,360 --> 11:03:43,380
Oh, sure, sure.

11717
11:03:43,380 --> 11:03:44,160
You get top 500.

11718
11:03:44,300 --> 11:03:44,860
Yeah, sure.

11719
11:03:45,260 --> 11:03:46,320
Sure, sure, sure.

11720
11:03:46,420 --> 11:03:49,000
You're gonna totally gonna end top 500 this season.

11721
11:03:49,320 --> 11:03:49,320
Yeah.

11722
11:03:49,560 --> 11:03:51,460
I totally believe in you.

11723
11:03:51,540 --> 11:03:53,120
I was top 50 in the beta.

11724
11:03:53,580 --> 11:03:54,780
Yeah, sure you were.

11725
11:03:55,000 --> 11:03:55,600
Where's the proof?

11726
11:03:55,660 --> 11:03:55,940
I was.

11727
11:03:56,080 --> 11:03:56,800
Where's the proof?

11728
11:03:57,640 --> 11:03:58,440
It's in the puddin'.

11729
11:03:58,440 --> 11:03:59,240
Where's the proof?

11730
11:03:59,760 --> 11:04:00,000
Beta's wiped.

11731
11:04:00,000 --> 11:04:00,760
It's in the puddin'.

11732
11:04:00,760 --> 11:04:01,600
Beta's got wiped.

11733
11:04:01,960 --> 11:04:02,700
You got no proof.

11734
11:04:03,060 --> 11:04:03,900
Wipe this.

11735
11:04:04,400 --> 11:04:04,880
Oh, yeah.

11736
11:04:04,880 --> 11:04:05,920
See, look at that.

11737
11:04:06,040 --> 11:04:09,880
These guys, he's just jealous that he doesn't have what we have, chat.

11738
11:04:10,060 --> 11:04:11,200
What is what you have?

11739
11:04:11,340 --> 11:04:15,460
Well, I have a nice chat that encourages me when I'm noob.

11740
11:04:15,480 --> 11:04:16,380
Fuck a nice chat.

11741
11:04:17,420 --> 11:04:20,600
Instead of your chat where people be like, fuck a nice chat.

11742
11:04:20,780 --> 11:04:21,680
Noob down.

11743
11:04:23,640 --> 11:04:24,880
Noob down's funny.

11744
11:04:27,880 --> 11:04:30,480
They also type wide among us gay sex.

11745
11:04:30,480 --> 11:04:31,300
What?

11746
11:04:32,920 --> 11:04:35,540
When do they use that in context?

11747
11:04:36,420 --> 11:04:37,780
Whenever they feel like it.

11748
11:04:38,000 --> 11:04:38,580
What?

11749
11:04:40,240 --> 11:04:41,280
Why not?

11750
11:04:42,640 --> 11:04:43,360
Alright, guys.

11751
11:04:44,000 --> 11:04:44,440
Guys.

11752
11:04:45,040 --> 11:04:46,440
We're gonna try again tomorrow.

11753
11:04:46,620 --> 11:04:50,420
Today was... we sort of self-sabotaged ourselves today.

11754
11:04:50,540 --> 11:04:52,220
We should've stopped at plat 1.

11755
11:04:54,820 --> 11:04:56,820
We'll go again tomorrow.

11756
11:04:59,820 --> 11:05:00,460
We're...

11757
11:05:00,460 --> 11:05:02,820
IMO for Marvel Rivals.

11758
11:05:04,400 --> 11:05:05,820
We'll see if SK's down.

11759
11:05:06,020 --> 11:05:07,860
Surefur's fucking busy with D&D.

11760
11:05:08,180 --> 11:05:08,860
I'm busy.

11761
11:05:09,100 --> 11:05:10,020
And Throne and Liberty.

11762
11:05:10,420 --> 11:05:13,020
And if we don't... I hope we make it tomorrow.

11763
11:05:13,280 --> 11:05:14,720
I might play some more off-stream.

11764
11:05:14,800 --> 11:05:17,800
Not today, not right now off-stream, but like in the morning off-stream.

11765
11:05:18,220 --> 11:05:20,960
Bro, you're missing all the poggers and moats, bro.

11766
11:05:21,240 --> 11:05:21,880
What do you mean?

11767
11:05:22,020 --> 11:05:22,540
It's YouTube.

11768
11:05:23,200 --> 11:05:25,020
You're missing people ragers.

11769
11:05:26,180 --> 11:05:28,000
What's people rager?

11770
11:05:28,000 --> 11:05:30,560
You don't know people rager, bro?

11771
11:05:30,560 --> 11:05:30,620
No.

11772
11:05:30,620 --> 11:05:32,480
Dude, that's a god-tier emote.

11773
11:05:32,680 --> 11:05:33,340
No, I don't.

11774
11:05:33,680 --> 11:05:36,220
That's a twitch thing.

11775
11:05:36,520 --> 11:05:37,460
I'm a YouTubie.

11776
11:05:37,720 --> 11:05:38,660
You're missing out.

11777
11:05:39,640 --> 11:05:40,880
Someone says, I blame Surefur.

11778
11:05:40,960 --> 11:05:41,920
He obviously...

11779
11:05:41,920 --> 11:05:42,520
No, okay.

11780
11:05:43,600 --> 11:05:44,740
Finish that sentence.

11781
11:05:44,880 --> 11:05:45,660
No, it's okay.

11782
11:05:45,840 --> 11:05:47,980
I didn't finish... What was LilPup saying?

11783
11:05:48,320 --> 11:05:49,560
What was LilPup saying?

11784
11:05:49,660 --> 11:05:50,760
I didn't write that.

11785
11:05:50,900 --> 11:05:53,960
You look at my chat and you figure out who said that.

11786
11:05:54,640 --> 11:05:55,600
Help me back?

11787
11:05:57,220 --> 11:05:58,700
What are you going to say to that guy?

11788
11:05:59,680 --> 11:06:00,700
Hold these nuts.

11789
11:06:01,720 --> 11:06:02,260
Okay.

11790
11:06:03,560 --> 11:06:04,100
Okay.

11791
11:06:09,660 --> 11:06:11,320
Alright, gg Surefur.

11792
11:06:11,480 --> 11:06:12,860
Wait, I'm showing people rager.

11793
11:06:13,420 --> 11:06:14,800
You're showing people's rager?

11794
11:06:15,060 --> 11:06:16,000
What does it look like?

11795
11:06:16,480 --> 11:06:17,360
I'm sending it.

11796
11:06:19,860 --> 11:06:21,820
They spam that and again...

11797
11:06:21,820 --> 11:06:22,220
Guys, no.

11798
11:06:22,260 --> 11:06:22,920
Don't be like Surefur.

11799
11:06:22,920 --> 11:06:26,120
Don't pray for LoserQ, guys.

11800
11:06:26,260 --> 11:06:26,740
We gotta...

11801
11:06:26,740 --> 11:06:28,680
Everyone pray for LoserQ.

11802
11:06:28,780 --> 11:06:31,020
Do not pray for LoserQ.

11803
11:06:31,580 --> 11:06:33,520
Do not pray for...

11804
11:06:33,520 --> 11:06:34,580
Pray for LoserQ.

11805
11:06:34,800 --> 11:06:36,120
This is what he sent me.

11806
11:06:36,900 --> 11:06:38,930
This is apparently the emote that...

11807
11:06:40,260 --> 11:06:41,960
They spam that and again.

11808
11:06:43,020 --> 11:06:44,820
Oh yeah, I did that too!

11809
11:06:44,920 --> 11:06:45,660
I did that in your chat!

11810
11:06:46,380 --> 11:06:48,160
I just didn't know the name of it.

11811
11:06:48,520 --> 11:06:49,720
It's people rager, bro.

11812
11:06:49,720 --> 11:06:49,920
Nope.

11813
11:06:52,100 --> 11:06:52,640
Alright.

11814
11:06:53,560 --> 11:06:54,280
GG Surefur.

11815
11:06:54,420 --> 11:06:56,840
I'll see you on Thursday for more...

11816
11:06:56,840 --> 11:06:59,120
more Marvel Rivals.

11817
11:06:59,540 --> 11:07:00,200
No, gg.

11818
11:07:01,260 --> 11:07:02,600
Don't have nightmares.

11819
11:07:03,280 --> 11:07:04,140
Oh, thanks.

11820
11:07:04,320 --> 11:07:04,760
I'll try.

11821
11:07:04,980 --> 11:07:06,700
I still have to work after this too.

11822
11:07:07,420 --> 11:07:10,100
I have to go back to work after this.

11823
11:07:10,160 --> 11:07:10,820
Workaholic out here.

11824
11:07:11,400 --> 11:07:14,760
No, I was supposed to work today after this stream.

11825
11:07:15,040 --> 11:07:18,400
But this stream ended up being about 11 hours long.

11826
11:07:18,920 --> 11:07:20,320
So, yeah.

11827
11:07:20,680 --> 11:07:21,700
At least you got overtime pay.

11828
11:07:22,140 --> 11:07:23,520
No, I don't.

11829
11:07:24,100 --> 11:07:25,580
I don't.

11830
11:07:28,520 --> 11:07:30,360
So, yep.

11831
11:07:31,780 --> 11:07:32,500
GG's though.

11832
11:07:32,780 --> 11:07:33,500
GG's.

11833
11:07:33,860 --> 11:07:36,160
Bye man.

11834
11:07:36,720 --> 11:07:37,220
Bye.

11835
11:07:39,480 --> 11:07:40,360
Alright.

11836
11:07:42,000 --> 11:07:44,120
Even though we didn't make it to top 500.

11837
11:07:45,280 --> 11:07:45,760
Because...

11838
11:07:45,760 --> 11:07:47,300
Q's were a little bit too unfortunate.

11839
11:07:47,800 --> 11:07:48,820
For us today.

11840
11:07:51,320 --> 11:07:52,280
They were...

11841
11:07:52,280 --> 11:07:55,020
They were some pretty fucked up Q's.

11842
11:07:55,100 --> 11:07:55,880
Not gonna lie.

11843
11:07:56,340 --> 11:07:57,720
I don't know what I did wrong.

11844
11:07:58,360 --> 11:07:58,920
I don't know.

11845
11:07:59,020 --> 11:08:00,620
I felt like I was doing pretty well.

11846
11:08:00,780 --> 11:08:04,000
I think like maybe some of my alts were pretty sketch.

11847
11:08:04,220 --> 11:08:10,480
But like, how can I fucking save an alt for 200,000 aggressive alts?

11848
11:08:10,480 --> 11:08:11,740
Like, I...

11849
11:08:11,740 --> 11:08:13,680
I had to pick and choose.

11850
11:08:14,060 --> 11:08:14,660
I...

11851
11:08:18,060 --> 11:08:18,600
But...

11852
11:08:19,140 --> 11:08:20,580
We will...

11853
11:08:20,580 --> 11:08:24,500
We will try again tomorrow.

11854
11:08:26,360 --> 11:08:26,900
Like...

11855
11:08:27,440 --> 11:08:28,980
We will...

11856
11:08:28,980 --> 11:08:30,680
We will...

11857
11:08:30,680 --> 11:08:32,040
Uh...

11858
11:08:32,040 --> 11:08:35,920
We will try again tomorrow, guys.

11859
11:08:36,220 --> 11:08:38,160
To get that top 500.

11860
11:08:38,160 --> 11:08:39,380
I hope we do.

11861
11:08:39,600 --> 11:08:40,760
I really hope we do.

11862
11:08:42,140 --> 11:08:44,900
But, thank you again to SK and Surefour.

11863
11:08:46,860 --> 11:08:49,820
For playing with me today.

11864
11:08:50,520 --> 11:08:51,820
It was really fun though.

11865
11:08:51,860 --> 11:08:52,560
I had a lot of fun.

11866
11:08:52,640 --> 11:08:56,820
Even though we didn't get top 500 today, I did have a lot of fun.

11867
11:08:56,940 --> 11:08:59,660
I'm sorry that we're rescheduling Doraemon, guys.

11868
11:08:59,880 --> 11:09:01,180
I'm so sorry.

11869
11:09:01,440 --> 11:09:03,300
For those who are looking forward to Doraemon.

11870
11:09:03,880 --> 11:09:05,780
But I really want top 500.

11871
11:09:05,780 --> 11:09:07,820
Guys, I...

11872
11:09:07,820 --> 11:09:08,400
Oh, sorry.

11873
11:09:08,520 --> 11:09:11,800
Later today, I really really want top...

11874
11:09:11,800 --> 11:09:12,720
I'm desperate.

11875
11:09:13,640 --> 11:09:15,060
Oh my gosh.

11876
11:09:15,660 --> 11:09:16,180
I'm...

11877
11:09:16,180 --> 11:09:18,480
Guys, it's my life now.

11878
11:09:19,400 --> 11:09:20,840
It's my life.

11879
11:09:21,360 --> 11:09:21,920
Alright, guys.

11880
11:09:22,020 --> 11:09:24,960
I'm going to not sleep because I have to finish my recordings.

11881
11:09:25,340 --> 11:09:27,600
But, as always, stay hydrated.

11882
11:09:27,880 --> 11:09:28,500
Posture check.

11883
11:09:28,680 --> 11:09:30,160
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

11884
11:09:30,340 --> 11:09:33,560
And if you stay up for me, head to bed because you deserve it.

11885
11:09:33,560 --> 11:09:34,940
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

11886
11:09:35,180 --> 11:09:35,740
Bye, guys.

11887
11:09:36,140 --> 11:09:36,500
Bye.
