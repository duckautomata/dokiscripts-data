Oh my god.

19
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:34,000
You told me not to care what the other time.

20
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:35,560
I didn't tell you shit.

21
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:36,240

22
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:37,820

23
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:38,780
That is fucked up.

24
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:39,420
That is fucked up.

25
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:47,640
Look, I woke up five minutes before our, no, 10 minutes
before our collab, but I showed up.

26
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,900
My only job was to show up.

27
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,660
I woke up half an hour before.

28
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:54,520
Half an hour.

29
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:56,220

I like Uta.

34
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,900
You didn't even tell Uta the time of the collab.

35
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:13,980
I can't wait for Uta to wake up and just flame you.

36
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:15,260
I can't wait.

37

I can't wait.

38
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:19,340
Uta waits all night for seven hours ago.

39
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:21,920
And I don't think she's gonna wake up soon.

40
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,320
Seven hours ago, that means she's gonna wake up in an hour.

41
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,220
Isn't it 530 in Japan?

00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:28,920

I can't believe that Ditto died.

282
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,420
How is that my fault?

283
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:57,660
She failed the jump.

284
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:57,860
That's so fucked up.

285
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,940

You didn't teach her!

288

How do I teach him to jump?

289
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:04,620
You could have tried and jumped better.

290
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,540
She didn't ask!

291
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:10,540
That is not her fault.

292
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:11,520
Look at it.

293
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:15,920
Yeah, we failed the jump that you failed 15 times without
us.

294
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,640
Yeah, but I didn't die.

295
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:20,100

Why did you help her?

298
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:26,540
She just jumped and died instantly.

299
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:28,820
There was no time for me to help her.

300
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:31,180
How much modulus?

301
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:32,520

302
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,360

308
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:20,000
Okay, okay, Doki.

309
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:26,080
But in my defense, Dito has been saying for the past, I
don't know how many days, that she's better than me at

310
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:26,880
lethal company.

311
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:32,640
So why do I need to teach someone that's better than me at
the game how to jump over a fence?

312
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,280
You know, you don't, you don't, you sort of write though,
Dito.

I know how to jump.

I know how to jump, but you took the life off and I couldn't
see anything.

315
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,460
So it's your fault.

00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,760
I don't know how to fight with this one.

349
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,560
We have to go back.

350
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:34,480
We have to go back.

351
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:35,440
We have to go back.

352
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:37,780
We have to go back.

353
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:38,480
Where is back?

354
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,160
I don't know where the back is.

355
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:40,700
Why?

356
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:41,980
Maybe this way.

357
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:42,620
Maybe this way.

358
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,200
I don't know where it is.

359
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:45,840
Are you sure?

360
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:46,500

You're just a bad teacher.

404
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:09,600

Can't believe you would do that to her.

415
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,860
You were supposed to be our supervisor.

You're like our supervisor.

417
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,760
You're not supervising good enough.

You should see the DMs between me and her.

419
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:11,300
She says she's better than me.

Okay.

00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:27,540
All right, we're behind you.

450
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:29,360
We're following you.

451
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:31,800
Oh my god.

452
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,560
There's a turret!

453
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,260
You just gotta just walk next to a turret!

454
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:35,340
Yeah, but we're okay.

455
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:36,520
It's not...

456
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,160
It's not working.

457
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:38,160
There you are!

458
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,360
It's a turret!

459
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,220
Wait, what?

460
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:42,820
Wait, let's do it!

461
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:44,940
Where is the turret?

462
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,080
No!

463
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:47,440
That doesn't!

464
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,440
That'll be bad.

465
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:53,600
The next to it is that blue!

466
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,700
Wait, no, we should run past it!

467
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:56,540
You can do it!

What is this?

471
00:23:59,440 --> 00:23:59,900
The back rooms?

472
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:00,980

473
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:01,800
See?

474
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:02,640
I'm better than you.

475
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,300
She wasn't scared.

476
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:06,180
You almost died three times, Ditto.

477
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:06,600
It's okay.

478
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,040
I don't know.

479
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:12,360
She seems to... She didn't die, though.

480
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,860
She's standing next to the turret and she's like, what?

481
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,040
That's true.

482
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:21,500
Wait, that's true though.

483
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:22,380
That's true.

484
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:24,660
Oh, I'm scared.

485
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:28,200
It's so dark, yeah.

486
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:29,720
It's so dark.

487
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:34,280
Wait, I thought dinner was like...

488
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,580
What is that?

489
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:38,180
What is that?

490
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:39,380

If you look away, pause.

496
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:54,480
It's like the annual.

497
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:56,440
So if I do this?

498
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:00,100

Wait, he can open doors.

537
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,260
It can open doors.

Okay, cool, cool, cool.

539
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:06,960
Oh, what if it was so funny if there was a monster behind
him?

540
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:08,540
That would be so funny.

541
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:10,620
Oh, what the heck?

542
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:12,280
He can open the door too.

543
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:14,200
What?

544
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,160
Escape.

545
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:18,180
Oh.

00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:20,220
Escape.

547
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:22,080
I need the fucking side door, chat.

548
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:25,680
Wait, we can't...

549
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:28,960
He can't die, though, because we have so much loot.

550
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:30,760
If he dies, we lose everything.

551
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,720
OPR, if he dies, we lose everything.

552
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:36,700
What's the sound?

553
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:39,640
Is this dead?

554
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:40,920
No?

555
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:41,440
No, no.

556
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:42,920
He's trying to find a side door.

557
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,280
His thing is not following me without making any audio.

558
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:48,540
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, I saw it!

559
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:49,440

560
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:51,260

562
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:52,320

563
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:55,840
No, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, I don't think he
saw it.

564
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:58,820
Okay, okay.

565
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:01,740
Oh, oh, she went, she went the other side.

566
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:03,600
Oh, I'm just gonna fuck out of me, bitch.

567
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:05,040
What the fuck?

568
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,220
Oh shit.

569
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:07,980
Oh my god, he didn't see it.

570
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:08,800
I saw it.

571
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:10,120
How am I gonna get out?

572
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:14,300
Oh, that's so scary.

573
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:15,980
Oh my god.

574
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,680
That's so scary.

575
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,440
Oh, that's so scary.

576
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:20,660
It's so dead.

577
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:21,300
Oh my god.

578
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,880
Jesus Christ, I was almost dead.

579
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:23,580
Jesus.

580
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:31,800

What the fuck is that?

584
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:55,600
Is it over?

585
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:56,640
I think so.

586
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:57,900
I don't think he's gonna live.

587
00:28:58,020 --> 00:28:59,400
What if I...

588
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,340
I don't think he's gonna live.

589
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:02,560
There's no way.

590
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:03,660
Fuck it.

591
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,240
There was no way out there.

592
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,020
I live!

593
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:15,220
I don't like this guy.

594
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:16,080
I have no weapon.

595
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:16,780
Bro!

596
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:18,780
I don't like this guy.

597
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:19,620
Oh, P.I.

598
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:24,440
The coin head is fine, but the big fucker with the wide
shoulders came, man.

599
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:25,400
Oh, P.O.

600
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,020
How could you do this?

601
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:28,640
Why didn't you tell me there was a hole there?

602
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,960
How did you guys?

603
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:31,860
I jumped into the hole.

604
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:33,020
Yeah..

605
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:33,940
We lost everything.

606
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:35,700
Yeah, we lost everything.

607
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:39,820
We jumped into the hole and it's some platforms.

608
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:43,440
I didn't know how I thought there was the same platform.

609
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,080
You didn't tell me.

610
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:49,180
I didn't tell you.

611
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:51,340
You didn't tell me, you're the leader.

612
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,080
Oh, your toilet.

613
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:01,300
We're so dead.

614
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,300
There's no way it's zero days.

615
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:04,360
We don't have anything.

616
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:07,560
Oh.

617
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:17,180
What's wrong?

618
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:18,280
How is anyone?

619
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:19,720
We all died.

620
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,780
There's no reason.

621
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:23,720
We have no money.

622
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,860
The company can't kill us if we kill ourselves first.

623
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:42,000
our life was in our own hands oh we had like 400 yeah yeah
you guys definitely have 400 you guys are great oh now we're

624
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:50,540

thought i was playing with pros what happened oh i'm just

625
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:53,400
doing my part i was playing with pro players

626
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:59,580
Guys, I was the baby.

627
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:14,450
You know what?

628
00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:15,730
You know what?

629
00:31:16,870 --> 00:31:21,110
You know, if Udo was here, this wouldn't have happened.

630
00:31:21,290 --> 00:31:21,890
It would be good.

631
00:31:21,890 --> 00:31:22,530
It would be good.

632
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:26,070
If Udo was here, she would have helped carry us.

633
00:31:26,530 --> 00:31:27,950
She's she's Bob Heyer.

634
00:31:28,010 --> 00:31:29,310
She's very good at this game.

635
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:32,150
Yeah, yeah, she would be a team player.

636
00:31:32,170 --> 00:31:35,750
So really, it's Dito's fault we're losing because she didn't
tell Uto the time.

637
00:31:36,850 --> 00:31:40,830
Yeah, honestly, I agree.

638
00:31:44,430 --> 00:31:46,110
Because I know it's not my fault.

639
00:31:46,190 --> 00:31:46,970
I showed up.

640
00:31:47,310 --> 00:31:48,270
I was a guest.

641
00:31:50,650 --> 00:31:51,910
I did my part.

642
00:31:51,950 --> 00:31:53,150
That was my only job.

643
00:31:53,530 --> 00:31:55,330
Put it on my schedule.

644
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:58,270
Put it on my schedule and then show up.

645
00:31:58,270 --> 00:32:00,150
That was my only job.

646
00:32:00,670 --> 00:32:03,710
I didn't look at the hazard level and now it's foggy.

647
00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:05,510
Wait, I can't see anything.

648
00:32:05,910 --> 00:32:06,450
Oh my god.

649
00:32:06,870 --> 00:32:07,850
I can't see.

650
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:10,310
So many ads.

651
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:12,450
What is Tyler Wong doing?

652
00:32:13,090 --> 00:32:14,090
I can't see.

653
00:32:14,410 --> 00:32:14,990
I'm here.

654
00:32:15,330 --> 00:32:16,110
Alright, let's walk in here.

655
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:17,770
Oh my gosh, where is the door?

656
00:32:17,930 --> 00:32:18,550
Oh, there's the door.

657
00:32:20,770 --> 00:32:21,090
Okay.

658
00:32:22,730 --> 00:32:24,070
Okay, other one.

659
00:32:24,290 --> 00:32:25,050
Where did he go?

660
00:32:26,330 --> 00:32:27,070
There's a turret.

661
00:32:28,270 --> 00:32:30,250
That's the only way we'd go, though.

662
00:32:31,270 --> 00:32:32,210
No, we'll go in here.

663
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:32,950
Oh, okay.

664
00:32:33,850 --> 00:32:34,570
Okay, okay.

665
00:32:37,210 --> 00:32:38,530
Oh, there's a mine.

666
00:32:40,890 --> 00:32:41,670
What's that?

667
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:42,490
Oh, is that a key?

668
00:32:44,490 --> 00:32:44,970
Yeah.

669
00:32:49,170 --> 00:32:50,810
Well, I heard another mine.

670
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:53,110
Oh, there's another mine.

671
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:55,370
Where is it?

672
00:32:55,450 --> 00:32:56,390
Do we have a house?

673
00:32:56,870 --> 00:32:57,350

Okay.

682
00:34:03,410 --> 00:34:05,170
There's two engines here, but I'm a fool.

683
00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:05,770
I can do this.

684
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:06,210
Wait.

685
00:34:07,050 --> 00:34:07,430
I can do it.

686
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:08,090
Can you carry this key?

687
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:09,450
Yeah, I can carry it.

688
00:34:10,270 --> 00:34:12,390
Okay, there's two engines here, and those are expensive.

689
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:13,710
Uh-huh.

690
00:34:16,050 --> 00:34:16,930
What do we do?

691
00:34:18,030 --> 00:34:19,510
We have to find the side door.

692
00:34:19,610 --> 00:34:20,710
We can't jump backwards.

693
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:22,850
Wait, why can't we jump backwards?

694
00:34:23,890 --> 00:34:24,270
Why?

695
00:34:24,590 --> 00:34:24,990
Why can't?

696
00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:26,470
Because we're carrying an engine.

697
00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:30,710
Oh Wait, why did you jump forward?

698
00:34:32,330 --> 00:34:33,950
I mean we could jump backwards.

699
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:35,190

The exit is here.

00:34:39,530 --> 00:34:40,050
Wait, where?

00:39:25,790 --> 00:39:27,030
Where's the ship?

806
00:39:27,270 --> 00:39:29,810
I don't remember where the ship is.

807
00:39:36,270 --> 00:39:40,510
Okay, I need to take her back to the ship.

808
00:39:40,750 --> 00:39:42,670
I don't know where it is.

809
00:39:43,330 --> 00:39:45,670
I don't know where it is.

810
00:39:49,250 --> 00:39:52,130
I can't believe she's dead.

811
00:39:53,650 --> 00:39:55,450
Wait, you didn't even leave the ship?

812
00:39:56,230 --> 00:39:58,010

What have you been doing?

816
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:02,810
Did you bring any loot?

817
00:40:03,210 --> 00:40:04,730
Where you don't need me.

818
00:40:04,770 --> 00:40:07,110
I brought the loot.

819
00:40:07,130 --> 00:40:10,030
And there's no loot in your hands, but you don't need me,
right?

820
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:12,330
I brought her.

821
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:13,830
Yeah, Spito's dead body.

822
00:40:13,990 --> 00:40:14,750
That's not loot.

823
00:40:15,210 --> 00:40:16,030
Well, it's fine.

824
00:40:16,210 --> 00:40:20,770
You guys don't need me, but she died within three seconds of
being without me.

825
00:40:21,070 --> 00:40:22,110
And you're throwing back.

826
00:40:22,290 --> 00:40:22,670
She died!

827
00:40:22,990 --> 00:40:23,210
She rolled!

828
00:40:23,870 --> 00:40:25,890
No, no, no, no.

829
00:40:26,130 --> 00:40:26,590
No, no, no.

830
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:28,550
She caused her own death.

831
00:40:28,810 --> 00:40:30,010
That was not...

832
00:40:30,270 --> 00:40:35,230
She tried to pick up the fucking- I'm going in!

833
00:40:35,390 --> 00:40:37,590
I'm 1HB!

834
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:41,470
Would it be fucked up if I start this shit while-

835
00:40:46,530 --> 00:40:52,330
Would it be fucked up if I start this shit while he's up
there?

836
00:40:55,430 --> 00:40:58,230
Look, I- I did my job!

837
00:41:00,270 --> 00:41:01,730
Has been cast.

838
00:41:02,190 --> 00:41:04,570
Okay, I didn't do that, though.

839
00:41:05,090 --> 00:41:06,330
Okay, that's not my fault.

840
00:41:06,510 --> 00:41:07,070
RPR!

841
00:41:07,750 --> 00:41:10,750
RPR, the boat has been casted!

842
00:41:15,870 --> 00:41:16,770
It's okay.

843
00:41:17,750 --> 00:41:18,990
That's not my fault.

844
00:41:19,730 --> 00:41:20,630
That's not my fault.

845
00:41:21,490 --> 00:41:22,570
Ditto was the one that voted.

846
00:41:22,610 --> 00:41:24,610
I'm not leaving the ship now that I know.

847
00:41:25,210 --> 00:41:26,590
Okay, the moment...

848
00:41:26,590 --> 00:41:27,210
Okay, guys.

849
00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:30,150
The moment...

850
00:41:36,010 --> 00:41:38,270
Wait, I didn't know if he's gonna come back!

851
00:41:38,810 --> 00:41:40,410
I need to see if he comes back!

852
00:41:40,810 --> 00:41:48,290
If he comes, and the moment I see his shadow, like a shadow
of him or hear his voice, I'll make sure the ship flies away

853
00:41:48,290 --> 00:41:51,630
so he can see the ship flying away before he can get on.

854
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:57,030
Wait, check the monitor.

855
00:41:57,470 --> 00:41:58,090
That's me.

856
00:41:59,010 --> 00:41:59,630
That's me.

857
00:42:01,350 --> 00:42:03,010
No, he's still alive, see?

858
00:42:04,470 --> 00:42:07,350
Oh, I could leave while he's still out there.

859
00:42:08,710 --> 00:42:09,590
Oh my god, look at him.

860
00:42:10,330 --> 00:42:11,430
Look, there he is.

861
00:42:12,790 --> 00:42:13,990
Whose body is that?

862
00:42:15,030 --> 00:42:15,670
Oh, goodbye.

863
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:23,420
Goodbye.

864
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:37,100
Oh, man, what happened?

865
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:42,620
Why did you just leave me behind, you dumbass?

866
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:44,300
I didn't do anything!

867
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:47,620
I was bringing loot back!

868
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:50,060
I'm too useless, fucking dumbass!

869
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:50,880
I didn't do anything!

870
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:51,860
I didn't do anything!

871
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:53,140
She voted!

872
00:42:53,620 --> 00:42:54,320
She voted!

873
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:55,300
She voted!

874
00:42:55,620 --> 00:42:56,660
What did you do that, dumbass?

875
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:58,320
I didn't know!

876
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:00,360
You die?

877
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:01,900
You waste our money!

878
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:04,380
And then you fuck us!

879
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:07,040
I didn't know!

880
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:14,120
I was just on the ship!

881
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:15,420
I didn't do anything!

882
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:16,760
I didn't know!

883
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:17,960
What is that command?

884
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:22,040
Don't click that shit.

885
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:23,560
It makes the ship leave.

886
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:26,000
Oh, it's I- okay, okay, okay.

887
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:27,680
Okay, you're right to the side.

888
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:33,740
Not only did she die, she costed us some money, And then she
took the ship away.

889
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:38,400
So I died too.

890
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:45,420
I was just chilling in the ship.

891
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:47,520

We got money.

1113
00:53:29,590 --> 00:53:30,750
Wait, oh wait.

1114
00:53:31,110 --> 00:53:33,530
Guys, I don't think we made the money, guys.

1115
00:53:34,990 --> 00:53:36,030
Yay, we reached the quota.

1116
00:53:36,530 --> 00:53:37,450
I just want you to do it.

1117
00:53:37,470 --> 00:53:43,550
know, Doki, that when you least expected, in the darkness of
the caves, I'm coming for you.

1118
00:53:43,590 --> 00:53:44,370
Why me?

1119
00:53:44,610 --> 00:53:45,590
What did I do?

1120
00:53:45,770 --> 00:53:47,230
How did I kill you?

1121
00:53:48,470 --> 00:53:49,610
I'm coming for you.

1122
00:53:49,610 --> 00:53:51,290
We didn't even kill you.

1123
00:53:51,430 --> 00:53:52,430
We were like alive.

1124
00:53:52,430 --> 00:53:58,770
When you least expected, in the deepest, darkest parts of
the dungeons, I'm coming for you.

1125
00:53:59,670 --> 00:54:00,650
What did we do?

1126
00:54:00,910 --> 00:54:02,870
We were like waiting for you.

1127
00:54:03,670 --> 00:54:08,890
Waiting for me to kill me as I'm carrying 300 Plus crap on
me.

1128
00:54:08,970 --> 00:54:11,110
Yeah You think I didn't see that?

1129
00:54:11,450 --> 00:54:12,790
You think I didn't see all of that?

1130
00:54:13,630 --> 00:54:15,010
And then you leave us.

1131
00:54:15,310 --> 00:54:19,030
You leave me and Vito with all the loot outside the ship.

1132
00:54:20,290 --> 00:54:21,690
So we just lost 500.

1133
00:54:22,350 --> 00:54:23,230
But we made a hunt.

1134
00:54:23,350 --> 00:54:24,370
We made the quota.

1135
00:54:25,030 --> 00:54:26,190
Go back to part of you.

1136
00:54:26,390 --> 00:54:26,930
I'll play alone.

1137
00:54:31,690 --> 00:54:33,250
Oh my god, he's angry.

1138
00:54:33,590 --> 00:54:34,870
Why is he so angry?

1139
00:54:35,110 --> 00:54:35,690
What do we do?

1140
00:54:37,470 --> 00:54:38,790
What is wrong with him?

1141
00:54:39,010 --> 00:54:40,330
Why is he so angry?

1142
00:54:42,650 --> 00:54:47,110
If Uto was here, if Uto was here, he was talking.

1143
00:54:47,670 --> 00:54:48,450
No, no.

1144
00:54:48,610 --> 00:54:50,450
But we didn't even do anything.

1145
00:54:50,670 --> 00:54:51,750
It was just talking.

1146
00:54:52,210 --> 00:54:52,210
Ew.

1147
00:54:52,670 --> 00:54:52,930
Yeah.

1148
00:54:53,210 --> 00:54:53,930
We're just talking.

1149
00:54:54,250 --> 00:54:56,290
We're just having a conversation.

1150
00:54:56,730 --> 00:54:58,590
We haven't done anything.

1151
00:54:58,770 --> 00:55:00,430
Yeah, we can't talk now.

1152
00:55:00,510 --> 00:55:01,130
I mean, entrance.

1153
00:55:01,370 --> 00:55:02,690
Yeah, what's wrong?

1154
00:55:02,830 --> 00:55:04,690
We can't even talk now?

1155
00:55:10,910 --> 00:55:11,690
It's a brain.

1156
00:55:12,390 --> 00:55:12,970
What do we get there?

1157
00:55:13,090 --> 00:55:13,690
Oh, we have to jump.

1158
00:55:14,610 --> 00:55:15,170
You first.

1159
00:55:16,010 --> 00:55:16,450
Okay.

1160
00:55:16,890 --> 00:55:17,770
I believe in you.

1161
00:55:19,010 --> 00:55:19,450
Yes.

1162
00:55:20,070 --> 00:55:20,390
Whoa.

1163
00:55:20,770 --> 00:55:21,350
Okay, my turn.

1164
00:55:21,770 --> 00:55:22,070
Woo.

1165
00:55:22,710 --> 00:55:23,730
We did it.

1166
00:55:23,870 --> 00:55:24,210
Okay.

1167
00:55:24,390 --> 00:55:25,250
There's a door over here.

1168
00:55:26,350 --> 00:55:27,430
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1169
00:55:27,850 --> 00:55:28,070
Yeah.

1170
00:55:28,390 --> 00:55:29,350
It's not a main entrance.

1171
00:55:29,890 --> 00:55:30,330
Let's go.

1172
00:55:31,770 --> 00:55:32,590
We don't need him.

1173
00:55:33,110 --> 00:55:33,350
Oh, wait, wait.

1174
00:55:33,530 --> 00:55:34,310
There's a loot.

1175
00:55:34,770 --> 00:55:35,310
I got loot.

1176
00:55:38,050 --> 00:55:39,690
Okay, I already got loot.

1177
00:55:41,050 --> 00:55:42,230
I already got loot!

1178
00:55:43,290 --> 00:55:44,210
Okay, nice.

00:55:45,610 --> 00:55:45,950
What is this?

1181
00:55:46,050 --> 00:55:46,050
What is this?

1182
00:55:46,050 --> 00:55:46,470
What is that?

1183
00:55:46,670 --> 00:55:47,570
Oh, it's a switch.

1184
00:55:50,990 --> 00:55:51,910
I don't like that.

1185
00:55:51,910 --> 00:55:54,610
What did you do?

1186
00:55:55,290 --> 00:55:55,790
I don't know.

1187
00:55:57,110 --> 00:55:59,690
I don't like that.

1188
00:55:59,750 --> 00:56:00,470
What did you do?

1189
00:56:02,030 --> 00:56:03,490
Okay, the light is on.

1190
00:56:03,890 --> 00:56:05,370
Oh, okay, I turned everything on.

1191
00:56:05,710 --> 00:56:06,010
Okay.

1192
00:56:08,270 --> 00:56:09,890
Here we go.

1193
00:56:11,290 --> 00:56:12,290
Wait, what's that sound?

1194
00:56:13,430 --> 00:56:14,150

I think he's gonna try to kill us!

1200
00:56:28,650 --> 00:56:29,790
That's a cursed item!

1201
00:56:30,990 --> 00:56:32,210
What was that item?

1202
00:56:32,350 --> 00:56:36,130
So like when you hold on to it, a ghost monster is gonna
chase you.

00:56:38,010 --> 00:56:40,250
Ah Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1206
00:56:44,910 --> 00:56:45,850

But where do we go?

1251
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:04,640
I don't know where to go.

1252
00:59:05,060 --> 00:59:07,660
Oh, um...

1253
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:09,080
I'm gonna follow you.

1254
00:59:10,780 --> 00:59:12,060
Maybe, maybe this way?

1255
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:12,920
Oh no.

1256
00:59:13,660 --> 00:59:14,240
Wait, wait.

1257
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:14,900
I'm lost.

1258
00:59:15,480 --> 00:59:16,440
I'm already lost.

1259
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:17,360
Maybe this way.

1260
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:18,240
Maybe this way.

1261
00:59:19,240 --> 00:59:19,500
Maybe this way.

1262
00:59:20,120 --> 00:59:21,160
To the ship.

1263
00:59:22,180 --> 00:59:23,400
I can't believe it.

1264
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:25,840
I stole his stuff.

1265
00:59:26,060 --> 00:59:26,560
To go to the ship.

1266
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:28,440
Where's Apio?

1267
00:59:28,620 --> 00:59:29,160
Is he dead?

1268
00:59:29,460 --> 00:59:30,400
No, I think he's alive.

1269
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:31,300
He was dead?

1270
00:59:31,460 --> 00:59:32,600
He would start the ship.

1271
00:59:33,260 --> 00:59:33,400
Shh.

1272
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:33,780

1283
01:01:18,130 --> 01:01:19,690
He got killed by a bug.

1284
01:01:19,970 --> 01:01:20,530
Look at it.

1285
01:01:27,690 --> 01:01:29,310

01:01:33,250 --> 01:01:35,170
I feel like he's getting karma.

1288
01:01:35,690 --> 01:01:36,410
Not us.

1289
01:01:37,570 --> 01:01:38,110
Not us.

1290
01:01:38,150 --> 01:01:38,570
Not us.

1291
01:01:38,630 --> 01:01:39,270
Not us.

1292
01:01:39,330 --> 01:01:40,130
We've been good.

1293
01:01:40,250 --> 01:01:41,750
I only died one time.

1294
01:01:41,750 --> 01:01:43,570
He's trying to...

1295
01:01:45,290 --> 01:01:47,190
He's gonna revenge us.

1296
01:01:47,190 --> 01:01:48,030
Yeah, no.

1297
01:01:48,450 --> 01:01:51,910
If he revenge us, he loses everything.

1298
01:01:52,970 --> 01:01:53,910
Whoa, Banto.

1299
01:01:54,330 --> 01:01:55,650
Wait, I got something.

1300
01:01:55,830 --> 01:01:56,430
Oh, you got something?

1301
01:01:56,610 --> 01:01:57,170
Oh, nice.

1302
01:01:57,490 --> 01:01:57,770
Yeah.

1303
01:01:58,690 --> 01:02:01,210
Oh, yeah, we're already doing our job.

1304
01:02:03,830 --> 01:02:06,710
Karma doesn't exist for us because we're good people, right?

1305
01:02:07,370 --> 01:02:07,670
Yeah.

1306
01:02:08,930 --> 01:02:10,050
Yes, yes.

1307
01:02:10,290 --> 01:02:10,770
Yeah, we're good.

1308
01:02:11,110 --> 01:02:12,450
Yeah, there's nothing in here.

1309
01:02:13,130 --> 01:02:14,150
Oh, I...

1310
01:02:14,170 --> 01:02:15,730
I think someone has nothing in there.

1311
01:02:15,990 --> 01:02:16,510
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1312
01:02:16,630 --> 01:02:17,190
He's not...

1313
01:02:17,190 --> 01:02:17,870
He's too dark.

1314
01:02:18,030 --> 01:02:19,250
There's nothing in here, too.

1315
01:02:19,550 --> 01:02:20,830
I think we have to go to this side.

1316
01:02:21,430 --> 01:02:22,330
It's staying in.

1317
01:02:23,150 --> 01:02:24,450
Yeah, it's all dead end.

1318
01:02:25,430 --> 01:02:26,010
All dead end.

1319
01:02:27,950 --> 01:02:28,290
Hello?

1320
01:02:29,390 --> 01:02:30,610

1325
01:02:36,230 --> 01:02:36,710
Oh, nice!

1326
01:02:37,190 --> 01:02:37,730
It's moving.

1327
01:02:38,990 --> 01:02:39,790
Look at us.

1328
01:02:39,890 --> 01:02:41,110
We're so efficient.

1329
01:02:42,790 --> 01:02:44,150
We're so good at this.

1330
01:02:44,170 --> 01:02:47,510
Wait, it's all dead end Dead end?

1331
01:02:47,910 --> 01:02:51,050
Wait, I should go here.

1332
01:02:51,430 --> 01:02:52,230

1333
01:02:52,370 --> 01:02:53,410
Yeah, that's dead end.

1334
01:02:53,750 --> 01:02:53,750

01:02:55,670 --> 01:02:57,030
This is all dead end.

1337
01:02:58,590 --> 01:02:59,390
Oh, I guess we go.

1338
01:03:00,690 --> 01:03:00,790

Yay!

1342
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:14,460

Okay.

1357
01:04:02,300 --> 01:04:04,380

So, this time it's my turn.

1360
01:04:13,180 --> 01:04:15,420
You guys are insane in the fucking head.

1361
01:04:36,300 --> 01:04:38,100
I didn't do it.

1362
01:04:38,140 --> 01:04:38,960
I didn't do it.

1363
01:04:38,980 --> 01:04:39,580
It was Ditto.

1364
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:40,920
It was Ditto.

1365
01:04:41,160 --> 01:04:42,220
I didn't do it.

1366
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:44,580
I didn't do it.

1367
01:04:45,380 --> 01:04:46,940

01:04:47,140 --> 01:04:47,960
It was Ditto.

1369
01:04:49,620 --> 01:04:50,820
I didn't do it.

1370
01:04:50,820 --> 01:04:53,260
I wasn't even the one that did it.

1371
01:04:53,260 --> 01:04:53,440
No.

1372
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:54,660

01:04:54,920 --> 01:04:56,000
Let's go here.

1374
01:04:56,340 --> 01:05:00,820
I can't believe he was the racist employee again though.

01:05:11,040 --> 01:05:12,700
Are we gonna make quota?

1376

Are we gonna make...

1377
01:05:15,400 --> 01:05:16,120
No, no, no, we have.

1378
01:05:16,340 --> 01:05:17,200
Should we go get the loot?

1379
01:05:17,420 --> 01:05:18,020
We will, yeah.

1380
01:05:18,500 --> 01:05:19,240
Our last time.

01:05:19,340 --> 01:05:20,540
Yeah, we got this.

1382
01:05:20,640 --> 01:05:21,600
We can do this.

1383
01:05:22,440 --> 01:05:23,260
Yeah, we can do it.

1384
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:23,420

You guys can make money.

1390
01:05:57,660 --> 01:05:59,800
This is so hard for me to be with us.

1391
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:02,560
It's the last day if you guys don't make money, you will
lose.

1392
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:04,580
So go make money because I'm not doing anything.

01:06:05,720 --> 01:06:07,080
It's the hard world.

No, I'm good.

1396
01:06:07,720 --> 01:06:08,860
We need help.

1397
01:06:08,920 --> 01:06:10,860
I'm going to watch you guys through the cameras here.

1398
01:06:11,120 --> 01:06:12,600
No, we don't have a walkie talkie.

1399
01:06:13,540 --> 01:06:15,040
Here, I'll buy you walkie talkies.

1400
01:06:15,240 --> 01:06:16,900
But that's a waste of our money.

1401
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:18,480
We're going to waste money.

1402
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:20,600
Here, go pick up walkie talkies, guys.

1403
01:06:22,440 --> 01:06:23,400
I'm sure you better.

1404
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:24,400
I'm on a strike.

1405
01:06:24,560 --> 01:06:25,100
I don't care.

1406
01:06:25,320 --> 01:06:26,300
Are you mad at us?

1407
01:06:26,360 --> 01:06:27,500
What do we do our fear?

1408
01:06:27,860 --> 01:06:28,480
Let's mediate.

1409
01:06:29,160 --> 01:06:31,200
Go make money or we die.

1410
01:06:31,500 --> 01:06:32,520
Go make money or we die.

1411
01:06:32,900 --> 01:06:33,900
Go make money or we die.

1412
01:06:35,080 --> 01:06:36,440
Go make money or we die.

1413
01:06:36,440 --> 01:06:36,880
But where's the walkie-talkie?

1414
01:06:37,380 --> 01:06:38,560
I don't mind dying.

1415
01:06:38,640 --> 01:06:42,040
I don't mind dying because I already been killed multiple
times.

1416
01:06:42,040 --> 01:06:44,600
What is... I have, I have no puppy.

1417
01:06:45,160 --> 01:06:47,080
Wait, where's the walkie-talkie?

1418
01:06:47,560 --> 01:06:48,480
Oh, there it is.

1419
01:06:48,940 --> 01:06:50,500
Yeah, yeah, remember this way.

1420
01:06:50,500 --> 01:06:52,840
But you need the walkie-talkie too, RPR.

1421
01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:54,360

1422
01:07:05,540 --> 01:07:07,830
They're so fucking dead

1423
01:07:23,240 --> 01:07:24,170
Where's the edge

1424
01:07:32,570 --> 01:07:32,950
Ah!

1425
01:07:47,360 --> 01:07:48,960

1427
01:07:51,360 --> 01:07:52,080

01:18:20,370 --> 01:18:20,750
Yeah, yeah.

1602
01:18:21,650 --> 01:18:22,250
Okay.

1603
01:18:25,750 --> 01:18:26,550
I'm not even flying.

1604
01:18:27,390 --> 01:18:28,930
Let's get the walkie-talkie.

1605
01:18:34,690 --> 01:18:35,250
Alright.

1606
01:18:35,910 --> 01:18:36,170
Okay.

1607
01:18:36,610 --> 01:18:37,890
I will walkie-talkie.

1608
01:18:40,390 --> 01:18:41,250
Let's go.

1609
01:18:41,870 --> 01:18:42,910
How do I use this?

1610
01:18:43,410 --> 01:18:43,550
Okay.

1611
01:18:44,070 --> 01:18:44,190
Hello?

1612
01:18:44,190 --> 01:18:44,630
Okay.

1613
01:18:45,150 --> 01:18:45,230
Okay.

1614
01:18:45,230 --> 01:18:45,290
Okay.

1615
01:18:45,290 --> 01:18:45,830
I got it.

1616
01:18:46,070 --> 01:18:46,390
Hello?

1617
01:18:46,650 --> 01:18:46,990
Hello?

1618
01:18:47,910 --> 01:18:48,470
Okay.

1619
01:18:49,050 --> 01:18:50,050
Yeah, I can hear you.

1620
01:18:50,130 --> 01:18:50,410
Hello.

1621
01:18:51,350 --> 01:18:52,930
Okay, I can hear you too.

1622
01:18:53,090 --> 01:18:53,670
Alright, let's go.

1623
01:18:53,730 --> 01:18:54,130
Let's go.

1624
01:18:55,030 --> 01:18:55,330
Look.

1625
01:18:55,750 --> 01:18:58,110
Where's the entrance?

1626
01:18:59,730 --> 01:19:00,730
And the...

1627
01:19:00,730 --> 01:19:01,890
Maybe go straight?

1628
01:19:02,310 --> 01:19:03,490
Okay, I'll follow you.

1629
01:19:03,970 --> 01:19:04,030
Here, here, here, here, here, here.

1630
01:19:04,490 --> 01:19:05,270
Oh, nice, nice, nice.

1631
01:19:05,610 --> 01:19:06,790
See, we're being so...

1632
01:19:06,790 --> 01:19:07,050
Careful!

1633
01:19:07,990 --> 01:19:08,890
Oh yeah, it's a fight.

1634
01:19:09,230 --> 01:19:11,070
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's... You can die from that.

1635
01:19:12,270 --> 01:19:16,030
Yeah, I have every... I have every die from this one.

1636
01:19:16,290 --> 01:19:17,030
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1637
01:19:17,110 --> 01:19:19,070
This is expensive walkie-talkie.

1638
01:19:20,690 --> 01:19:21,470
How much?

1639
01:19:21,670 --> 01:19:21,970
How much?

1640
01:19:21,970 --> 01:19:23,770
It was like... It was like $20.

1641
01:19:25,810 --> 01:19:26,790
Where's the entrance?

1642
01:19:26,970 --> 01:19:27,870
Oh, there, there, there, there, there!

1643
01:19:29,130 --> 01:19:30,690
I see it, I see it, I see it, I see it.

1644
01:19:30,690 --> 01:19:31,250
Okay, let's go.

1645
01:19:32,450 --> 01:19:33,690
We have walkie-talkies now.

1646
01:19:33,690 --> 01:19:34,530
Oh, there's a lot of stuff!

1647
01:19:34,810 --> 01:19:35,150
There's...

1648
01:19:36,450 --> 01:19:37,670
There's a lot of stuff!

1649
01:19:37,710 --> 01:19:40,710
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1650
01:19:40,710 --> 01:19:41,510
Hello, do you hear me?

1651
01:19:41,770 --> 01:19:42,030
Okay, okay.

1652
01:19:42,650 --> 01:19:43,570
We're taking back.

1653
01:19:46,930 --> 01:19:48,090
We're taking back?

1654
01:19:48,190 --> 01:19:49,270
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1655
01:19:50,290 --> 01:19:51,190
We're taking back.

1656
01:19:51,350 --> 01:19:52,470
Okay, okay, look at us.

1657
01:19:52,650 --> 01:19:53,010
Okay.

1658
01:19:53,450 --> 01:19:55,430
With this, we can make a lot of money.

1659
01:19:55,750 --> 01:19:57,010
Yeah, we can, we did it.

1660
01:19:57,270 --> 01:19:58,410
We're doing our part.

1661
01:19:59,510 --> 01:20:00,030
Yes.

1662
01:20:00,490 --> 01:20:00,790
Yeah.

1663
01:20:01,650 --> 01:20:02,530
Okay, let's go.

1664
01:20:02,770 --> 01:20:03,710
We're so helpful.

1665
01:20:04,130 --> 01:20:05,570
We're making money.

1666
01:20:05,990 --> 01:20:06,230
Ah!

1667
01:20:11,940 --> 01:20:13,980
Okay, I'm 1 HP.

1668
01:20:14,260 --> 01:20:15,700
I'm 1 HP.

1669
01:20:16,200 --> 01:20:16,900
Oh, me too.

1670
01:20:17,900 --> 01:20:18,400
Me too.

1671
01:20:18,420 --> 01:20:20,200
Okay, we shouldn't, we shouldn't...

1672
01:20:20,200 --> 01:20:21,600
We can come from this.

1673
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:22,520
This way, this way.

1674
01:20:23,200 --> 01:20:25,060
I don't think we should go inside.

1675
01:20:25,220 --> 01:20:26,180
We're 1 HP.

1676
01:20:26,320 --> 01:20:27,240
We did our part.

1677
01:20:27,760 --> 01:20:30,940
Wait I have to wait for this.

1678
01:20:31,460 --> 01:20:31,620
Alright.

1679
01:20:33,460 --> 01:20:34,260
Wait, where's the ship?

1680
01:20:35,900 --> 01:20:36,940
Do you know where the ship is?

1681
01:20:37,140 --> 01:20:38,780
I never know where the ship is.

1682
01:20:39,040 --> 01:20:40,860
Maybe on our left side?

1683
01:20:41,360 --> 01:20:41,780
Oh, okay.

1684
01:20:42,360 --> 01:20:43,500
Oh, I see it, I see it.

1685
01:20:44,180 --> 01:20:45,000
Yeah, I scanned it.

1686
01:20:45,120 --> 01:20:45,280
Which one?

1687
01:20:45,400 --> 01:20:46,460
Oh, okay, okay, okay, okay.

1688
01:20:46,740 --> 01:20:48,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's this way.

1689
01:20:48,820 --> 01:20:49,140
I think?

1690
01:20:50,420 --> 01:20:51,420
Okay, no, I don't.

1691
01:20:51,520 --> 01:20:52,280
I don't see it.

1692
01:20:52,400 --> 01:20:53,020
I'm lost.

1693
01:20:54,220 --> 01:20:54,580
Oh.

1694
01:20:54,920 --> 01:20:55,580
I'm lost.

1695
01:20:56,460 --> 01:20:56,940
Where is this?

1696
01:20:57,500 --> 01:20:58,800
No, I didn't lie.

1697
01:20:58,860 --> 01:20:59,900
I'm just stupid.

1698
01:21:00,080 --> 01:21:01,020
Where's the shame?

1699
01:21:01,180 --> 01:21:03,000
Oh, I see, I see, I see, I see, I see.

1700
01:21:03,100 --> 01:21:04,000
You're just stupid!

1701
01:21:06,260 --> 01:21:06,780
No!

1702
01:21:07,560 --> 01:21:08,760
You can be stupid.

1703
01:21:09,040 --> 01:21:10,840
Only up here, stupid is enough, okay?

1704
01:21:12,260 --> 01:21:13,600
Okay, maybe...

1705
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:14,720
You can be more stupid.

1706
01:21:14,900 --> 01:21:15,700
We can all be...

1707
01:21:15,700 --> 01:21:17,640
Okay, I'm stupid, but not that stupid.

1708
01:21:18,600 --> 01:21:19,120
Okay.

1709
01:21:21,340 --> 01:21:23,220
Only up here is enough.

1710
01:21:24,080 --> 01:21:24,160
Okay.

1711
01:21:24,920 --> 01:21:25,240
Yay!

1712
01:21:25,680 --> 01:21:26,680
We made money!

1713
01:21:27,500 --> 01:21:28,780
Wait, where's our boom box?

1714
01:21:30,220 --> 01:21:31,820
Wait, where did our music box go?

1715
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:32,860
Oh, I have it!

1716
01:21:33,040 --> 01:21:33,220
Wait!

1717
01:21:33,860 --> 01:21:34,600
Okay, okay.

1718
01:21:35,520 --> 01:21:36,560
Is up here dead?

1719
01:21:37,140 --> 01:21:37,500
Is he?

1720
01:21:38,120 --> 01:21:38,580
Oh, no!

1721
01:21:38,780 --> 01:21:39,400
He's dead!

1722
01:21:39,740 --> 01:21:40,340
Wait, is he dead?

1723
01:21:40,500 --> 01:21:40,560
See?

1724
01:21:41,400 --> 01:21:42,800
No, maybe he's hiding.

1725
01:21:43,860 --> 01:21:44,820
Is he hiding?

1726
01:21:44,980 --> 01:21:47,120
I think he's dead?

1727
01:21:47,340 --> 01:21:49,000
No, no, he has to be hiding.

1728
01:21:50,100 --> 01:21:51,200
He doesn't move.

1729
01:21:51,720 --> 01:21:52,400
Wait, how do I...

1730
01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:53,460
Where's my walkie-talkie?

1731
01:21:53,600 --> 01:21:54,380
Did I drop it?

1732
01:21:55,440 --> 01:21:56,840
Where's my walkie-talkie?

1733
01:21:58,300 --> 01:22:02,060
Okay, I'm gonna go back again.

1734
01:22:02,300 --> 01:22:03,920
Where's my walkie-talkie, though?

1735
01:22:04,420 --> 01:22:06,480
Oh, we should go move.

1736
01:22:07,220 --> 01:22:08,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1737
01:22:08,600 --> 01:22:09,860
Just drop down, maybe.

1738
01:22:10,300 --> 01:22:11,800
Oh, maybe we should all go back.

1739
01:22:12,040 --> 01:22:12,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1740
01:22:12,900 --> 01:22:14,260
We should go back and get the loot.

1741
01:22:16,160 --> 01:22:17,020
Oh, my.

1742
01:22:17,280 --> 01:22:19,680
Oh, where's my walkie-talkie?

1743
01:22:20,020 --> 01:22:20,980
This way, this way.

1744
01:22:21,560 --> 01:22:24,260
I think I dropped it when I fell.

1745
01:22:26,220 --> 01:22:26,640
Okay.

1746
01:22:27,500 --> 01:22:28,620
I think it's...

1747
01:22:28,620 --> 01:22:29,260
Is it this way?

1748
01:22:29,420 --> 01:22:29,620
You call it?

1749
01:22:31,120 --> 01:22:32,820
I don't know how to get back.

1750
01:22:33,400 --> 01:22:34,100
I don't know.

1751
01:22:34,120 --> 01:22:35,720
This way, this way, this way.

1752
01:22:36,060 --> 01:22:36,340
Okay, okay, okay.

1753
01:22:36,340 --> 01:22:36,980
Okay, I follow you.

1754
01:22:37,720 --> 01:22:38,960
I'm already lost.

1755
01:22:41,720 --> 01:22:42,360
This way?

1756
01:22:42,680 --> 01:22:46,340
I think, I think you drop it at the main entrance.

1757
01:22:46,500 --> 01:22:47,060
Oh, maybe.

1758
01:22:47,220 --> 01:22:47,960
Yeah, I think so.

1759
01:22:47,980 --> 01:22:49,080
When I was picking stuff up.

1760
01:22:50,800 --> 01:22:51,240
Don't worry.

1761
01:22:51,300 --> 01:22:51,620
I have music.

1762
01:22:51,720 --> 01:22:53,500
Okay, we have...

1763
01:22:54,740 --> 01:22:55,180
Oh.

1764
01:22:55,460 --> 01:22:55,900
Oh.

1765
01:22:55,900 --> 01:22:56,160
Oh.

1766
01:22:56,580 --> 01:22:56,640
Oh.

1767
01:23:02,230 --> 01:23:06,410
Oh my gosh, I hear... I hear... I hear the key's voice.

1768
01:23:06,970 --> 01:23:08,030
I hear your voice!

1769
01:23:08,490 --> 01:23:09,370
What is that?

1770
01:23:09,550 --> 01:23:11,210
There's things behind us.

1771
01:23:11,650 --> 01:23:12,650
There's my walkie-talkie!

1772
01:23:13,330 --> 01:23:14,310
She's walkie-talkie!

1773
01:23:14,610 --> 01:23:15,790
Why is she talking to you?

1774
01:23:16,210 --> 01:23:21,730
Grab it, grab it, grab it.

1775
01:23:21,970 --> 01:23:22,430
I got this.

1776
01:23:22,810 --> 01:23:23,050
I got this.

1777
01:23:23,050 --> 01:23:23,550
I got this.

1778
01:23:23,750 --> 01:23:23,930
I got this.

1779
01:23:23,930 --> 01:23:24,350
Okay, okay.

1780
01:23:24,670 --> 01:23:25,650
Go back, go back.

1781
01:23:33,410 --> 01:23:38,070
Wait, it's dark now so there's a lot of monsters outside.

1782
01:23:38,450 --> 01:23:40,470
Yeah, don't worry.

1783
01:23:41,410 --> 01:23:42,230
I have this.

1784
01:23:53,530 --> 01:23:57,350

You guys are not real.

2146
01:45:07,710 --> 01:45:09,630
It doesn't matter if you die to the giant.

Just pick up the loot or we lose anyway.

2148
01:45:12,990 --> 01:45:14,150
I'm not serious.

2149
01:45:15,250 --> 01:45:16,870
There was an engine there.

2150
01:45:16,870 --> 01:45:18,410
They killed everything they had.

2151
01:45:19,350 --> 01:45:20,410
You lived in, then what?

2152
01:45:20,690 --> 01:45:21,090
They lost.

2153
01:45:22,510 --> 01:45:23,710
We still lost.

2154
01:45:25,470 --> 01:45:25,930
They don't could have grabbed it.

2155
01:45:25,930 --> 01:45:26,510
I don't care.

2156
01:45:27,230 --> 01:45:30,510
They don't could have grabbed it when he was chasing.

2157
01:45:31,150 --> 01:45:33,090
She could have grabbed it.

2158
01:45:33,650 --> 01:45:36,170
One of you died, the other one, take the B.

2159
01:45:36,570 --> 01:45:37,690
Yeah, to know.

2160

He was chasing me.

2161
01:45:40,470 --> 01:45:42,110
He was chasing me.

2162
01:45:43,030 --> 01:45:44,370
It wasn't my fault.

2163
01:45:45,570 --> 01:45:46,670
That's good!

2164
01:45:47,170 --> 01:45:48,190
Wait, we need $10.

2165
01:45:48,850 --> 01:45:51,330
One body is like $10, right?

2166
01:45:52,290 --> 01:45:52,850
No, it's...

2167
01:45:52,850 --> 01:45:53,530
One body.

2168
01:45:54,690 --> 01:45:56,410
How much is...

2169
01:45:56,410 --> 01:45:57,470
Ah, that's me!

2170
01:45:57,750 --> 01:45:58,490

2171
01:45:58,970 --> 01:46:01,290
It was Dinosaur!

2172
01:46:01,550 --> 01:46:03,790

2173
01:46:04,610 --> 01:46:06,150
It wasn't my fault!

2174
01:46:07,470 --> 01:46:08,150
Dinosaur!

2175
01:46:09,090 --> 01:46:11,490
It was not my fault!

2176
01:46:12,430 --> 01:46:13,730
You need to die for the company.

2177
01:46:15,250 --> 01:46:16,210
No, I did it!

2178
01:46:16,270 --> 01:46:16,810
I did it!

2179
01:46:17,150 --> 01:46:18,170
I did so...

2180
01:46:18,170 --> 01:46:19,650
You both need to die for the company.

2181
01:46:20,970 --> 01:46:22,290
The more money, the better.

2182
01:46:24,230 --> 01:46:25,350
Only one of us have...

2183
01:46:25,350 --> 01:46:25,570
No!

2184
01:46:25,970 --> 01:46:26,890
Only one of us!

2185
01:46:27,310 --> 01:46:29,390
There is behind you!

2186
01:46:29,550 --> 01:46:30,330
There is behind!

2187
01:46:31,930 --> 01:46:32,050
Huh?

2188
01:46:40,130 --> 01:46:43,110
All these things...

2189
01:46:43,110 --> 01:46:45,750
Man, what do you mean?

2190
01:46:45,950 --> 01:46:47,210
Why are you getting paranoid?

2191
01:46:47,550 --> 01:46:48,890
You think you're safe?

2192
01:46:49,110 --> 01:46:49,790
You think you're safe?

2193
01:46:52,130 --> 01:46:53,990
You think you're safe!

2194
01:46:58,430 --> 01:47:00,470
No, don't jump off!

2195
01:47:01,090 --> 01:47:02,630
You're gonna make a fool again.

2196
01:47:03,310 --> 01:47:04,990
Why are you running?

2197
01:47:05,790 --> 01:47:07,790
I'm not running, I'm not running.

2198
01:47:08,430 --> 01:47:09,930
Why are you killing us?

2199
01:47:10,530 --> 01:47:11,830
Why are you trying to kill us?

2200
01:47:11,830 --> 01:47:13,350
Because your body is worth money!

2201
01:47:16,110 --> 01:47:17,350
How about your body?

2202
01:47:17,530 --> 01:47:19,150
Well, I got the shovel don't I?

2203
01:47:19,670 --> 01:47:20,890
Yeah, you're gonna die.

2204
01:47:21,490 --> 01:47:22,510
Okay, then we're gonna lose.

2205
01:47:22,630 --> 01:47:23,590
Fuck it, let's lose.

2206
01:47:25,270 --> 01:47:29,010
I sacrificed my body!

2207
01:47:30,190 --> 01:47:33,010
I will sell your body, I will sell your body.

2208
01:47:33,790 --> 01:47:34,670
I will sell your life.

2209
01:47:34,830 --> 01:47:35,810
Ah, it's important.

2210
01:47:42,610 --> 01:47:43,410
It's important.

2211
01:47:43,410 --> 01:47:45,790
It's okay, it's okay that we'll win the game.

2212
01:47:46,110 --> 01:47:49,570
We're like, we're gonna win the game of our body.

2213
01:47:51,450 --> 01:47:52,970
Are we gonna make it?

2214
01:47:53,210 --> 01:47:54,550
Yeah, because it's $10.

2215
01:47:55,130 --> 01:47:57,150
We just needed $10, I think.

2216
01:47:57,510 --> 01:47:59,110
I think we just needed that $10.

2217
01:47:59,110 --> 01:48:01,490
Yeah, yeah, we just needed that $10.

2218
01:48:02,490 --> 01:48:02,970
Oh, we do.

2219
01:48:03,570 --> 01:48:04,090
Blask.

2220
01:48:05,570 --> 01:48:06,090
Oh, yeah.

2221
01:48:06,090 --> 01:48:06,690
There's more.

2222
01:48:06,770 --> 01:48:07,290
There's more.

2223
01:48:07,670 --> 01:48:10,050
If he knows, we need anything we can get.

2224
01:48:10,430 --> 01:48:11,930
Do I sell the walkie-talkie chat?

2225
01:48:12,350 --> 01:48:13,990
Sell the walkie-talkie?

2226
01:48:16,810 --> 01:48:18,030
I don't know.

2227
01:48:18,310 --> 01:48:19,410
Why is he so mad?

2228
01:48:19,670 --> 01:48:20,430
I don't...

2229
01:48:21,570 --> 01:48:23,090
Yeah, he's so mad.

2230
01:48:23,590 --> 01:48:24,870
Yeah, why is he so mad?

2231
01:48:25,110 --> 01:48:25,870
I don't understand.

2232
01:48:26,730 --> 01:48:27,670
I don't understand.

2233
01:48:28,850 --> 01:48:31,370
Maybe we make him wake up too early.

2234
01:48:33,390 --> 01:48:35,990
Yeah, maybe it's because it's too early.

2235
01:48:41,710 --> 01:48:43,790
How much money do we get?

2236
01:48:43,790 --> 01:48:44,270
How much do we get?

2237
01:48:46,110 --> 01:49:00,350
should we get we should have we should have like enough
right we're short 25 25 25 then what's the point of killing

2238
01:49:00,350 --> 01:49:18,250
us 45 25 25 if only one engine or one beehive the nine of
them took but had two take but instead they were running

2239
01:49:18,250 --> 01:49:29,790
because living is more important than making money for the
company now we die all of us we die as a team we die as a

2240
01:49:29,790 --> 01:49:48,390
team yeah we die as a team yeah we die if uto was here if
uto was here We would have made the money.

2241
01:49:48,890 --> 01:49:51,330
We would have made the money of Uto in C.

2242
01:49:52,330 --> 01:50:01,890
If one of you picked up the beehive or the engine or the
other person is being chased by the giant, I was being

2243
01:50:01,890 --> 01:50:03,290
chased by a giant.

2244
01:50:03,290 --> 01:50:04,790
I was being chased by a giant.

2245
01:50:05,170 --> 01:50:07,790
Just die for the die for the car to die.

hours.

Get up and move around.
