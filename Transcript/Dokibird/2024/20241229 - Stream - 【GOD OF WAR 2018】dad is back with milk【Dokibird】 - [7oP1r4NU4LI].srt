1
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:29,820
A little pause...

00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:40,000
and we are back.

3
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,740
A little pause... and we are back.

4
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:55,180
Oh my god, where am I?

00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,120

I don't know how to do this.

15
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,680
If I didn't queue the last game, if I didn't queue the last game.

00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:21,240
I wouldn't be streaming God of War right now.

45
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:13,940
I can't tell if she was actually good or she was just there, mooching off.

00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,000

00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,240

00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,420
There we go.

79
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,820
I don't know where to put this text, like, here.

80
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,600
We'll put it right here.

81
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,820

82
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:01,260

00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,020

85
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:05,620
I swear, guys, I...

86
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:11,000
God of War, bros, skip to January 11th.

87
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:12,660
I'm a time traveler.

88
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,340
Thank you for the super fan for a super chat.

89
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:15,720
Good on.

90
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:16,120
Thank you.

91
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:16,940
Thank you.

92
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,700
I really appreciate it.

93
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:19,440
Thank you.

94
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,180
Thank you.

95
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:21,740
It's gonna be different.

96
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:28,600
Also, I realized that, I don't know why, oh my gosh, I shouldn't even have put my overlay here because that's where, like, you can see the kill feed.

97
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:29,500
But that's alright.

98
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,840
You don't need to see the kill feed.

99
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:40,480
You don't need to see the kill... I told Mac, I told Abrelated that, like, the Q won without me first, so, like, I hope he's doing okay in his um, in his game.

100
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,800
Okay, no, they lost.

101
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:42,160
Okay.

102
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,340
Wait, no, they won.

103
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,640
Wait, no, they won.

104
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,200
He played support and they won.

105
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:47,240
Let's fucking go.

106
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:48,620
I wasn't there for that win.

107
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,000
Fucking, that sucks.

108
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,720
Oh my god, that could've been my one win.

109
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:59,800
I would've just needed one more win after that.

110
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:07,360
I would've just needed one more win after that, and then...

111
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,340
Oh my god.

112
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,200
Oh my god, it's fine.

113
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,380
Everything is okay, guys.

114
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:14,800
Everything is okay.

115
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:20,820
I am requesting to join, and then maybe I'll get a I'll get...

116
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,700
He has declined.

117
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:24,180
Hello?

118
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,020
Oh, wait, he's in...

119
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:28,640
Um...

120
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,580
I'm R.

121
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,700
Oh my god, stop the Q, you fucker.

122
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:33,420
Stop the Q.

123
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:38,070
Okay.

124
00:08:38,670 --> 00:08:39,510
Oh, thank god.

125
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:39,870
Okay.

126
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:41,630
Okay, he stopped the Q.

127
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:42,650
I was like, decline!

128
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:50,050
No, I changed my stream.

129
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:56,950
And he's like, I gotta do my stream.

130
00:08:57,130 --> 00:08:58,150
I'm doing a different thing.

131
00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:00,750
And he's like, oh, you have time for one more.

132
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:02,390
No.

133
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:06,410
I have a problem.

134
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:12,270
And he's dead.

135
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:20,850
I swear.

136
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:23,850
Oh my god, it'll be fine.

137
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:27,350
Oh no, I totally understand.

138
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:29,170
Oh my god.

139
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:33,630
Please, guys, we just need...

140
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:37,950
We just need one...

141
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:39,830
We just need two wins.

142
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:42,290
We just need...

143
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:45,170
We just need two wins.

144
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:47,070
Oh my god.

145
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:53,510
Guys, after two wins, after two wins, we will get GM1.

146
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:55,510
Guys, I...

147
00:09:57,310 --> 00:09:59,950
Technically, technically, Thor is here.

148
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:01,990
So technically, it's God of War.

149
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:03,110
We have Thor.

150
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:10,050
We have Thor on our team.

151
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:12,930
It's technically...

152
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:15,230
It's technically God of War.

153
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:16,190
I'm not judging.

154
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:19,170
Oh my god, wait, what?

155
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:21,450
Then why the fuck did she pick Luna?

156
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:22,590
Like the moon.

157
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:24,430
Alright, that's fine.

158
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:25,550
That's fine.

159
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:27,310
I got my gamer subs ready.

160
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:30,370
And, oh my god, it's gonna be okay, guys.

161
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:33,490
It's gonna...

162
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:34,910
No!

163
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:36,350
I can't do it!

164
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:38,250
Guys, look, there's Thor!

165
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:40,130
There he is!

166
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:50,110
There he is!

167
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:55,250
Oh my god.

168
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:01,930
Oh my god, there he is.

169
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:03,850
There he is.

170
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:04,970
There's our boy Thor.

171
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:07,590
Oh my god, there he is.

172
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:09,210
I would cry.

173
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:11,970
I know, I would...

174
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:13,410
I would cry.

175
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:16,410
I've been playing since three in the morning.

176
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:22,390
I had a six game last week.

177
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:24,670
Did I gain everything back?

178
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:27,450
I've almost gained everything back.

179
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:29,010
I will actually...

180
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:30,710
Oh fuck me, I will explode.

181
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:37,730
I just need it back, guys.

182
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:41,630
Why do I have 168 ping?

183
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:45,070
What the fuck is wrong?

184
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:47,210
What is...

185
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:47,810
No way!

186
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:52,330
What the fuck?

187
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:53,910
There's no way.

188
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:58,290
There's no way that this happens to me on...

189
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:02,830
There's no way I'm actually getting DDoS right now.

190
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:05,890
There's actually no way I'm getting DDoS.

191
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:08,850
Yeah, I'm bad.

192
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:10,370
Someone ban Allen.

193
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:13,450
Someone, you're bad for a day, Allen.

194
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:16,990
You're actually bad for the day for this.

195
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:18,890
Literally...

196
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:20,830
Where's my boss?

197
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:23,050
Ban him for a fucking day.

198
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:28,710
Everything would have been fine.

199
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:29,790
Allen.

200
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:31,490
Everything.

201
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:33,510
He actually gets bad for a day.

202
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:34,470
I'm fucking...

203
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:35,630
Oh my god, I can't.

204
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:38,170
I... Oh my god.

205
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:42,290
I'm actually... I'm gonna fucking freak out.

206
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:44,390
Oh my god, the server's better.

207
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:50,610
The server's finally okay after all the shit we just been through.

208
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:53,670
That's actually crazy.

209
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:55,530
Oh my...

210
00:12:55,530 --> 00:12:56,710
You're still getting banned for a day.

211
00:12:56,970 --> 00:12:57,750
That was...

212
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:59,190
That was fucking terrible.

213
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:01,110
I'm so sad.

214
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:02,970
I'm so sad.

215
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:07,250
No, you are...

216
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:10,310
You are still getting banned for the day.

217
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:15,490
The fact that that was my fucking first game...

218
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:16,250
Yeah, no.

219
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:23,010
I hope... I hope you learn your fucking lesson.

220
00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:34,010
Oh my god.

221
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:34,370
Oh my god.

222
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:36,850
That was fucking... Oh my god.

223
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:39,650
God bless you.

224
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:42,750
Oh my god.

225
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:43,710
I thought it was me.

226
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:45,330
I thought it was because I was streaming.

227
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:46,390
Oh my god.

228
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:47,270
I'm sorry.

229
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:49,770
The game volume must be really fucking loud.

230
00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:50,830
I'm so sorry.

231
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:53,150
I forgot to change my game volume.

232
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:54,270
I went straight in.

233
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:57,490
I fucking went straight into this game.

234
00:13:57,930 --> 00:14:01,190
I'm so sorry that the volume is so fucking loud.

235
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:09,030
I just went straight into it.

236
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:11,330
I was so fucking... I was ready.

237
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:13,130
This is God of War.

238
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:15,350
Look, there's... Oh wait, that's Magneto.

239
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:19,350
The enemy team.

240
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:22,070
The enemy team has Thor.

241
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:23,730
Just like God of War.

242
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:26,510
Just like God of War.

243
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:28,130
The enemy is Thor.

244
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:29,670
Guys, look at that.

245
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:32,330
Look at that.

246
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:35,510
It's just like it.

247
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:39,170
Okay.

248
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:41,390
That's right.

249
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:45,510
Also, remember to unban him after 24 hours.

250
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:54,770
Just remember to unban him after 24 hours, guys.

251
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:56,630
No, you're not.

252
00:14:56,950 --> 00:14:57,610
No, you're not.

253
00:14:57,790 --> 00:15:00,750
By the way, the new Lunatech is that you bind your scroll wheel.

254
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:03,310
You're actually dead though.

255
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:05,570
Oh my god!

256
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:09,150
It's a bind scroll wheel to your ult, so it goes zoom, zoom, zoom.

257
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:11,310
It's the newest tech.

258
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:13,070
Newest Lunatech.

259
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:15,650
Don't worry, I got you.

260
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:18,310
There we go.

261
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:20,450
Alright.

262
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:22,230
Everything is fine.

263
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:24,570
Alright.

264
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:26,750
You will get banned.

265
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:29,090
You will get banned if the next game is fucked up.

266
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:30,050
I swear to god.

267
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:33,370
I swear to god.

268
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:39,650
If the next game was just like what happened with the...

269
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:41,430
Well, no!

270
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:43,970
No, we gotta set an example.

271
00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:47,210
We have to set an example, Silent.

272
00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:48,770
We banned him.

273
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:52,710
He put the cursor raw and I was in a 200 ping server.

274
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:54,490
I fixed the audio.

275
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:55,930
I fixed the audio.

276
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:02,830
24 hour ban just for Alan.

277
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:05,450
Cause like right after I...

278
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:11,210
Oh my god.

279
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:13,270
That's fucking right.

280
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:14,950
He said it.

281
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:18,930
You gotta learn from your fucking mistakes.

282
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:20,890
Alright.

283
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:24,010
Alright, here we go.

284
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:25,670
This is fine.

285
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:27,630
This is fucking fine.

286
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:30,130
I'm okay.

287
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:31,490
Right after...

288
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:33,410
Oh my god, I'm so okay.

289
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:40,390
Oh my god, he's fucking dead.

290
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:42,070
Oh, but they're all... It's fine.

291
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:43,450
We won this.

292
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:52,670
Someone's enjoying themselves a little too much.

293
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:53,970
Alright.

294
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:55,370
Whoops.

295
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:57,330
I should've been...

296
00:16:57,330 --> 00:16:58,610
We're down to rams this.

297
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:00,630
Alright.

298
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:01,410
This is fine.

299
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:03,890
This is so fine.

300
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:07,270
This is so... We're so okay.

301
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:11,170
I fucking love Marvel Rises.

302
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:15,730
Oh my god, I love Marvel Rises so much.

303
00:17:16,590 --> 00:17:20,070
I have a problem and I don't know what to do.

304
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:23,250
I don't know how to fix Ezreal.

305
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:28,370
You can't fix me!

306
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:29,930
No!

307
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:40,500
Oh my god, you can't fix me!

308
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:45,340
You can't fix me!

309
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:47,760
Goodbye!

310
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,620
Oh my god, I did it.

311
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:56,480
I'm so fucking good at this game!

312
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:01,140
Why are you so scared of him?

313
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,000
Why are you so scared of him?

314
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:04,400
I gotta leave.

315
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:05,160
I gotta leave.

316
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,400
Oh my god, I'm sorry, Shane.

317
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,320
I baited the shit out of you, Shane.

318
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:11,580
I actually baited you so fucking hard.

319
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,120
I baited Shane so hard!

320
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,000
Shane, thanks for taking that for me, Shane.

321
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:23,540
I really appreciate it.

322
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,240
Thanks, Shane!

323
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,560
Good job, Shane!

324
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:31,740
Shane!

325
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:35,240
You did what I needed you to do!

326
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,980
How the fuck?

327
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:39,980
Oh.

328
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:41,660
I don't know.

329
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,600
Okay, Magnia, you gotta stay up there.

330
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:47,600
Let's do this again!

331
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,200
Let's fucking go!

332
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:51,920
Woo!

333
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,900
Ah, our DPS is so dead though.

334
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,200
Oh, wait, he lived!

335
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,240
Oh, I thought I could freeze him again.

336
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,180
You know what?

337
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:06,020
Fuck these guys.

338
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:09,180
Oh, wait, there's a turret right there.

339
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:09,920
There we go.

340
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:11,860
Oh, shit!

341
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:15,320
I'm still alive!

342
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,120
Oh my god!

343
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:19,180
How many times I beat you up?

344
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,820
Oh, where are you?

345
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:24,540
Oh my god, fuck you, slap you too!

346
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:27,120
Okay, there we go.

347
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:28,720
Alright, nice.

348
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,020
One more game.

349
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,060
One more game.

350
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:35,100
I froze that guy like five times.

351
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:36,180
I'm...

352
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:40,180
Don't worry!

353
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:45,400
I just need one more game, and then we're back and gone.

354
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:48,260
It's just a little detour.

355
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:52,620
Thor was there, technically.

356
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:54,740
He was there, guys.

357
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,000
He was there.

358
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:03,220
Guys, Thor was there for that game, so technically, it's like, it's like God of War.

359
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,960
Lord Kurosu, thank you for the Akasupa!

360
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:07,040
Thank you!

361
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:11,160
Because the Curse of Ra isn't enough to combat this level of addiction, I cast Curse of Ra.

362
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:12,240
Okay!

363
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:18,860
Alright, if the next game I get... If I next game I lose, we're gonna have another ban.

364
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:26,960
Every curse you put on me and I lose, you're a 24 hour... You're going to baby jail.

365
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:33,340
You're going to fucking baby jail.

366
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,480
Akasupa, thank you, thank you.

367
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:41,600
You think... I am not joking.

368
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,120
I will fucking put...

369
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:46,100
I will personally... No, actually no, you would like that.

370
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:48,320
I'll make sure my mods put you in baby jail.

371
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:50,600
I won't even fucking do it myself.

372
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,560
Please, we're almost there.

373
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:00,320
We're almost there.

374
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,580
This is it.

375
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:06,620
This is the game.

376
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,420
This is the game.

377
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:11,100
This is the game.

378
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:14,680
Oh, my mods are so happy.

379
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,880
They're like, oh my god, we can finally ban somebody.

380
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,340
Oh my god.

381
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:20,960
No, no.

382
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:23,260
Guys, guys, it's... We'll be there.

383
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:24,800
Well, this is...

384
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:28,920
Guys, if we have no curses, this will be the game.

385
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,640
Guys, this will be it.

386
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,020
It will be fine.

387
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:34,040
Come on, please.

388
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:35,420
Someone's not loaded in.

389
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,400
Who is not loaded?

390
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,320
Everybody's loaded in.

391
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:41,760
What are we waiting for?

392
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:44,180
JL, thank you for the Akasupa.

393
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:45,320
Thank you.

394
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:46,860
Look at the bright side, Dragoons.

395
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:48,100
We're going to get official...

396
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:51,020
My whole rival's at this thing.

397
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,240
Thank you, the Akasupa.

398
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,100
Thank you.

399
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:58,460
I don't have a problem.

400
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:00,960
I have a fucking problem.

401
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:02,400
No!

402
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:05,880
There's no way.

403
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:07,600
No, pick Adam.

404
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,380
Pick Adam, Chunky.

405
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:11,740
Oh my god, Adam.

406
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:14,860
No, you gotta... You please pick Adam.

407
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:15,940
I'm gonna ban.

408
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:17,300
I'm gonna ban Bruce.

409
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,560
I'm gonna... Oh my god, Mac.

410
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:20,880
Please don't play Storm.

411
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:23,600
Mac, I just need one more win.

412
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:31,860
I just need one more win and then I can get GM one... Oh my god, please.

413
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:34,500
Oh my god, I'm banning fucking Hawkeye.

414
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:35,280
I refuse.

415
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,060
I refuse to play.

416
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:41,600
I swear to god, Mac, if you...

417
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,440
Oh wait, okay.

418
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:45,040
Oops, I didn't realize everybody's banning Bruce Banner.

419
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:47,060
That's my bad.

420
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:50,620
My go-to has always been Hawkeye.

421
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,580
That's... Oh my god.

422
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:55,940
Gotta play against the Hawkeye now.

423
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,360
Oh my god.

424
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:07,040
And I can get GM back and then I can go back to my regular scheduled stream.

425
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:11,560
Please, Mac.

426
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:12,240
Please.

427
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:16,460
Oh my god.

428
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:19,720
Why is he on...

429
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,100
Yes.

430
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:26,100
Please, Mac.

431
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:31,240
Is this you telling...

432
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:31,940
Mac.

433
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:38,540
I swear to god.

434
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,080
Oh my god.

435
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:44,180
A desperate cry to nobody.

436
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,480
Who was it?

437
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,220
Oh.

438
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:47,820
Holacrosis.

439
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:53,980
I swear to god, your curse has made him fucking play Storm.

440
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:59,620
If I lose, it's gonna be a one week ban.

441
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:02,120
It's not even gonna be one day.

442
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:03,400
Fucking wrong.

443
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,460
You made him play Storm.

444
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:08,900
One of the worst characters.

445
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:12,800
And...

446
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,820
And Luna ban.

447
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:17,780
I swear to fucking god.

448
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:24,800
Oh my god.

449
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,280
And they have a fucking...

450
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:27,800
Oh my god.

451
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:29,520
What killed me?

452
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,420
What killed me?

453
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,500
What killed me?

454
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:39,340
What killed me?

455
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:40,280
Oh.

456
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:42,700
Oh my god.

457
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:48,360
I don't even know what killed me.

458
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:56,360
I don't...

459
00:24:56,360 --> 00:25:00,500
I don't even know what killed me.

460
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:03,340
Oh my god.

461
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:05,660
Oh my god.

462
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:06,740
I don't have snaps.

463
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:09,340
I don't have snaps.

464
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:14,420
Oh my god.

465
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,440
He's so low.

466
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:19,440
Oh my god.

467
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:19,660
Please.

468
00:25:20,410 --> 00:25:21,900
I will fucking... Oh.

469
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:26,900
I'm gonna fucking slap you until you die!

470
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:33,790
Goodbye.

471
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:38,030
I'll leave.

472
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:40,270
I hate you!

473
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:45,550
Did we get it?

474
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:46,830
Oh my god.

475
00:25:46,890 --> 00:25:48,150
We fucking got it.

476
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:49,670
Thank fucking god.

477
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:51,550
Oh my god.

478
00:25:51,610 --> 00:25:52,850
We fucking got it.

479
00:25:52,910 --> 00:25:55,470
I just gotta do the long walk.

480
00:25:56,030 --> 00:26:00,990
I just gotta do the long fucking walk.

481
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:04,730
Oh my god.

482
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:07,130
There were so many bubbles.

483
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:08,350
Alright.

484
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:11,510
I don't play Adam, but he's meta, so I have to play Adam.

485
00:26:12,690 --> 00:26:14,710
He's actually really good for this map though.

486
00:26:15,970 --> 00:26:16,530
Like...

487
00:26:16,530 --> 00:26:18,330
I prefer Adam over...

488
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:20,330
Oh my god.

489
00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:22,330
This fucking...

490
00:26:23,430 --> 00:26:23,670
Oh.

491
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:24,530
Mine.

492
00:26:28,050 --> 00:26:28,610
Alright.

493
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:32,990
Oh.

494
00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:35,170
Alright.

495
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:37,070
Nice.

496
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:38,470
That's cool.

497
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:41,710
Alright, let's go.

498
00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:42,570
Born again.

499
00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:43,770
Let's fucking do this again.

500
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:44,910
Come on, everybody.

501
00:26:45,810 --> 00:26:46,730
Come on.

502
00:26:47,290 --> 00:26:47,570
Oh.

503
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:48,950
Nope, but he is born again.

504
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:50,450
Oh, I put it too late.

505
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:50,870
Alright.

506
00:26:50,930 --> 00:26:51,450
That's cool.

507
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:52,630
Oh!

508
00:26:52,770 --> 00:26:53,590
That's cool!

509
00:26:54,410 --> 00:26:57,390
What happened to my born again?!

510
00:26:57,390 --> 00:26:58,350
What is... Oh.

511
00:26:58,630 --> 00:27:00,510
We're just that far?

512
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:02,150
I can't believe it.

513
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:04,430
I can't believe it didn't register.

514
00:27:08,270 --> 00:27:10,530
I can't believe it didn't register.

515
00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:12,250
I thought it did.

516
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:15,390
Oh my god.

517
00:27:17,770 --> 00:27:18,450
Okay.

518
00:27:19,290 --> 00:27:20,290
This is not great.

519
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:23,870
This is not looking so good, guys.

520
00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:25,310
They have triple support.

521
00:27:26,210 --> 00:27:27,650
Mantis is banned, guys.

522
00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:28,290
I can't.

523
00:27:28,290 --> 00:27:30,190
That's why I'm literally playing Adam.

524
00:27:31,930 --> 00:27:34,010
Mantis is literally banned.

525
00:27:36,210 --> 00:27:40,210
I would not be playing Adam if...

526
00:27:40,210 --> 00:27:41,590
Oh my god.

527
00:27:42,650 --> 00:27:45,070
Oh my god.

528
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:49,310
Nice.

529
00:27:50,050 --> 00:27:50,050
Nice.

530
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:51,790
We did it, everybody.

531
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:58,820
Alright, this is fine.

532
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,160
Oh my god.

533
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:03,620
Dr. Strange.

534
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:04,140
Dr. Strange!

535
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:07,120
Please!

536
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:11,560
Dr. Strange!

537
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:12,780
Dr. Strange.

538
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:13,680
Dr. Strange.

539
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:15,720
Dr. Strange.

540
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:16,640
Dr. Strange.

541
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:19,380
Dr. Strange.

542
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,340
Dr. Dr. Strange.

543
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:22,720
Dr. Strange.

544
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:23,480
Dr. Strange.

545
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:25,540
I swear.

546
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:28,520
The fucking god!

547
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:37,560
Oh my god, I'm just hoping this does something.

548
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,900
Please, stop standing into the mines.

549
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,540
Please, I beg of you.

550
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:48,200
Oh my god, I hope he's doing stuff over there.

551
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,320
I hope he's alright.

552
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:52,040
I hope he's...

553
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:54,960
Let's go!

554
00:28:58,720 --> 00:28:59,340
Let's go!

555
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:01,920
He's over there.

556
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:07,880
Oh, okay.

557
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:12,740
Alright.

558
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:15,340
Doctor Strange, Doctor Strange.

559
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:17,800
Oh, Doctor Strange.

560
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:20,360
Doctor Strange, Doctor Strange, Doctor Strange.

561
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:25,720
Oh my god.

562
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:28,300
Everything is okay.

563
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:33,440
Everything will be okay.

564
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:37,580
Why do people not die when I want them to die?

565
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:41,260
It's actually... Please wait for like one second and then I'll give you heals.

566
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:46,620
Oh my god.

567
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:49,360
God damn it.

568
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,560
I just need you guys.

569
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:56,260
Alright, there you go.

570
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:59,320
Doctor Strange, Doctor Strange.

571
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,780
Oh, Doctor Strange.

572
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:04,220
Doctor Strange, Doctor Strange, let's go.

573
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,180
I'm sorry, I'm brain rotted right now.

574
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:11,180
It's been really rough.

575
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:13,600
Oh my god.

576
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:14,560
Oh, goodbye.

577
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:15,980
You're so fun.

578
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:16,140
Oh my god.

579
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:23,580
We live here.

580
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,320
I told them.

581
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:28,820
No, no, I did not mean a cocoon!

582
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:31,340
I got him though.

583
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,760
Okay, that works.

584
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:38,940
That's fine.

585
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:41,160
I didn't mean a cocoon, but it works though.

586
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:44,060
Get that vehicle moving again!

587
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,200
That's fucking me.

588
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:48,500
I'm never going that way again.

589
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:51,420
Oh my god.

590
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:57,500
Alright.

591
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:00,860
It's fine.

592
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:04,580
Alright.

593
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:07,320
Dude, I don't have enough heals.

594
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:08,360
God damn it.

595
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:11,520
Alright.

596
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:13,780
It's fine.

597
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,040
Look at Punisher.

598
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:20,740
There we go.

599
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:29,000
Everything is fine.

600
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:38,660
Okay, I can't.

601
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:40,140
Alright, that's fine.

602
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:42,850
That's absolutely fine.

603
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:45,520
I dove!

604
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:47,280
There is a Punisher wreck.

605
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,040
Okay, I'm fucking, it's time.

606
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:50,360
I have to go Jeff to get back.

607
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:54,620
I have to beat Jeff to get to my teammates in time.

608
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:59,720
Oh my god, I have to get there so I can swim.

609
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:01,620
Oh my god, what the fuck!

610
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:06,980
Fucking oh shit!

611
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,880
Guys, guys, no!

612
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,340
I got killed.

613
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:20,880
I got killed.

614
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:21,880
I got killed.

615
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:26,500
Oh my god.

616
00:32:28,550 --> 00:32:30,160
Oh my god.

617
00:32:31,870 --> 00:32:33,940
I can't believe it.

618
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,680
Oh my god.

619
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:40,100
A curse is real.

620
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:42,560
A curse is actually real.

621
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:50,340
Oh my god.

622
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:53,220
I don't know what to do.

623
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:54,760
What play?

624
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:57,700
I don't know what to do.

625
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,560
I don't know if Adam is the play.

626
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:00,880
Alright.

627
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,780
Oh my god.

628
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:05,060
I'll do Loki.

629
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:06,680
Maybe Loki is it.

630
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:08,580
Maybe Loki is it.

631
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:13,660
I feel like I was doing alright on Loki and Adam.

632
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:15,120
But like, we'll try Loki.

633
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:16,860
Adam and Loki.

634
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,320
Alright, if Loki doesn't work, I'll swap to Adam.

635
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:22,940
Oh my god.

636
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:26,240
I don't know.

637
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:27,840
I don't know.

638
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:28,580
They banned.

639
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:31,920
They banned so many characters.

640
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:38,160
See guys, it's technically God of War.

641
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,220
I'm on Loki.

642
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:42,300
It's technically God of War.

643
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:45,020
I'm on Loki, guys.

644
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,400
Where the fuck is our tank?

645
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,680
Okay, I was gonna say.

646
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,160
Where's our tank?

647
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:01,520
How do I- How am I gonna heal you?

648
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:05,300
How am I- How am I gonna heal you?

649
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:14,260
Alright.

650
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:16,940
Let's see.

651
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:18,240
There's a guy right here.

652
00:34:23,090 --> 00:34:24,590
Oh, he's like whipping my guy.

653
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,460
He's like just whipping him.

654
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:35,300
Alright, guys.

655
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:38,400
I need you- Alright.

656
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:43,380
This is- This is not look- Kurosis, this is your fault.

657
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:46,160
This is actually- Kurosis, this is your-

658
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:55,780
Kurosis, I need you to know.

659
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:58,960
We could've had it all.

660
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:08,460
We could've had- Remember, if we don't get God of War- Now- Remember why.

661
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,240
Remember why.

662
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,490
No, I didn't leave.

663
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:19,960
It's okay, it's just me.

664
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:22,320
It's just me.

665
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:27,720
Is he- Oh my god, it fucked up my fucking clone!

666
00:35:35,390 --> 00:35:41,270
God fucking- Guys, I- Mac,

667
00:35:47,890 --> 00:35:51,110
I - I swear to god.

668
00:35:52,690 --> 00:35:55,290
I'm fucking- I'm fucking running.

669
00:35:56,130 --> 00:35:57,810
I'm gonna fucking run.

670
00:35:58,770 --> 00:36:02,490
I'm gonna fucking- I'm fucking running.

671
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:06,910
I'm fucking- Oh my god.

672
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:15,740
Oh my god.

673
00:36:21,130 --> 00:36:22,890
I swear to god.

674
00:36:23,650 --> 00:36:31,770
I- I don't think- Oh my god, why do we have a widow?

675
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:34,710
Why the fuck do we have a widow?

676
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:44,780
I don't play DPS!

677
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:47,040
I don't- What the fuck?

678
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:48,680
Go.

679
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:52,800
You triple- Sup.

680
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:58,100
It's meta.

681
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:04,140
Oh my god, he's actually one.

682
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:08,700
What are you- Why is he like- I don't do it.

683
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:09,720
I don't do it!

684
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,040
I don't do DPS!

685
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:13,620
Just go triple support!

686
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:18,540
Oh.

687
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:19,860
Goodbye.

688
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:24,500
Goodbye, go triple sup- support.

689
00:37:32,510 --> 00:37:34,670
Oh my god.

690
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:37,310
Oh my god.

691
00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:39,170
I don't understand.

692
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:41,830
Why didn't you go triple support earlier?

693
00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:45,810
Why- Why didn't you go triple-

694
00:37:49,390 --> 00:37:50,110
Really?

695
00:37:53,450 --> 00:37:54,650
That's all that we needed.

696
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:05,490
Please kill the clone.

697
00:38:06,290 --> 00:38:08,670
Don't make me be the only one.

698
00:38:10,530 --> 00:38:16,670
Guys, not only did Mac-

699
00:38:22,730 --> 00:38:25,730
This - This double curse you guys did for me.

700
00:38:25,730 --> 00:38:33,370
Not only did like- Did like- I have triple- I have triple support players.

701
00:38:33,530 --> 00:38:35,610
But it made Mac play Storm.

702
00:38:35,910 --> 00:38:39,350
Which by the way, he has never played Storm before.

703
00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:43,650
This is the second thing.

704
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:45,290
I'm sorry.

705
00:38:47,970 --> 00:38:50,330
Remember what you've all done.

706
00:38:51,270 --> 00:38:51,890
Hmm.

707
00:38:55,330 --> 00:38:55,890
Okay.

708
00:39:04,990 --> 00:39:05,610
Alright.

709
00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:07,870
I have to do this.

710
00:39:08,350 --> 00:39:09,050
Just in case.

711
00:39:12,470 --> 00:39:13,630
Oh my god.

712
00:39:14,990 --> 00:39:15,970
Oh my god.

713
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:19,250
Second chance is over.

714
00:39:21,510 --> 00:39:23,130
Okay, this is where I die.

715
00:39:23,250 --> 00:39:24,450
This is actually where I die.

716
00:39:27,370 --> 00:39:29,230
We have no second chance.

717
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:31,190
Who the fuck got swapped?

718
00:39:31,310 --> 00:39:32,690
Oh my god.

719
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:38,430
Alright.

720
00:39:40,030 --> 00:39:41,030
Not ideal.

721
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:42,690
Alright, we're banning Mac.

722
00:39:42,810 --> 00:39:46,290
I'm gonna fucking ban- I- Oh my god.

723
00:39:46,350 --> 00:39:46,830
What?

724
00:39:48,850 --> 00:39:50,190
Where was that?

725
00:39:50,390 --> 00:39:52,210
It showed up last minute.

726
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:55,710
She actually threw that the moment I peeked the door.

727
00:39:56,510 --> 00:39:58,470
That's actually crazy.

728
00:40:01,870 --> 00:40:02,530
Mac.

729
00:40:12,470 --> 00:40:14,110
Oh my god.

730
00:40:15,430 --> 00:40:16,890
Alright, one week ban.

731
00:40:17,570 --> 00:40:18,450
One week ban.

732
00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:19,330
I'm fucking ready.

733
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:22,250
I'm fucking ready for my one week ban.

734
00:40:30,830 --> 00:40:31,670
Oh yeah.

735
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:43,500
Alright, I'm fucking trying to- I'm trying to kill- Please, he's so low.

736
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:47,060
No.

737
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:48,120
No, no, no, no, no.

738
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,560
I fucking got- Oh, thank god.

739
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:49,980
No,

740
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:54,880
you fucking go, Jeff.

741
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:01,740
Oh my god, he was actually so low though.

742
00:41:06,910 --> 00:41:08,130
Oh my god.

743
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:12,610
Oh, bad guy.

744
00:41:20,030 --> 00:41:21,390
Good luck.

745
00:41:22,530 --> 00:41:24,190
Oh, good luck to me too.

746
00:41:24,770 --> 00:41:25,670
Good luck to me.

747
00:41:28,670 --> 00:41:29,670
Good luck.

748
00:41:31,050 --> 00:41:31,730
No!

749
00:41:34,270 --> 00:41:35,810
I'm cocooning, I'm cocooning.

750
00:41:35,950 --> 00:41:36,190
No!

751
00:41:38,870 --> 00:41:40,810
I couldn't- I couldn't die!

752
00:41:43,290 --> 00:41:44,870
Alright, goodbye.

753
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:45,890
One week ban.

754
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:51,330
One- You said you would come!

755
00:41:54,690 --> 00:41:56,610
What happened?!

756
00:41:57,190 --> 00:42:01,010
You stopped and turned the face around!

757
00:42:01,490 --> 00:42:02,730
No, you didn't!

758
00:42:11,170 --> 00:42:12,330
Ben!

759
00:42:12,850 --> 00:42:14,030
We had nothing!

760
00:42:21,190 --> 00:42:21,770
Ben!

761
00:42:22,070 --> 00:42:27,930
That curse, I should- Oh my god.

762
00:42:34,590 --> 00:42:35,350
Alright.

763
00:42:35,350 --> 00:42:36,230
Alright, who else cursed?

764
00:42:36,530 --> 00:42:37,910
I'm fucking hitting all of you.

765
00:42:38,670 --> 00:42:40,610
You guys tripled it.

766
00:42:41,050 --> 00:42:41,470
Alright.

767
00:42:41,990 --> 00:42:44,030
Tequila burrito, one week ban.

768
00:42:45,350 --> 00:42:47,770
El Mexican, one week ban.

769
00:42:48,970 --> 00:42:51,590
So you guys gotta ban them later.

770
00:42:52,130 --> 00:42:54,150
Exactly one week.

771
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:03,120
One week ban!

772
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:05,580
This could've been over!

773
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:06,980
Mack!

774
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:09,760
Please!

775
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:15,420
I need a stream cut or more!

776
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:17,860
My dragoons are crying!

777
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:25,160
Mack, please.

778
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:31,280
Okay, okay.

779
00:43:39,350 --> 00:43:45,100
If we win the next two games, I will get the hundred.

780
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:49,440
Get me out of here.

781
00:43:51,370 --> 00:43:53,940
So you better get me out of here.

782
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:55,100
Get out of here.

783
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:01,760
Get out of here.

784
00:44:02,540 --> 00:44:04,720
Okay, alright.

785
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:08,820
You don't understand.

786
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:12,020
You don't understand, guys.

787
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:16,420
I felt like I was being fucking held hostage.

788
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:23,520
I feel like I'm being fucking held hostage right now.

789
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:35,100
I swear, if he was not on Storm, and he was on literally all the characters, like Starlord or anything, it would've been okay.

790
00:44:36,380 --> 00:44:42,680
I'm holding you guys hostage because my duo is holding me hostage right now.

791
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:48,780
Literally, all I needed was...

792
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:52,260
Starlord last game.

793
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:58,500
This is the second time I've ever seen Mack on Storm.

794
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:03,700
And Storm is considered the lowest tier pick for Marvel Rivals.

795
00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:05,680
I don't see Storm players.

796
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:11,020
The only people who are fucking crazy enough to play Storm are people who are fucking Storm 1 tricks.

797
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:22,160
Alright.

798
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:23,780
Alright, here we go.

799
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:24,760
I'm okay.

800
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:26,340
I'm okay.

801
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:28,260
I'm okay.

802
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:30,640
Everything will be fine.

803
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:32,660
Three supports is okay, too.

804
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,080
Oh my god.

805
00:45:36,660 --> 00:45:38,560
Okay, focus, Jokey.

806
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:40,860
It's time to focus.

807
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:45,780
It's time to fucking focus right here.

808
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:47,180
Thank god I can aim.

809
00:45:49,540 --> 00:45:52,440
Isaiah is like, I'm not shooting anything.

810
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:54,940
Okay.

811
00:45:58,580 --> 00:45:59,220
Okay.

812
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:01,280
Here we go.

813
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:05,100
Oh, you're gonna be fine.

814
00:46:05,540 --> 00:46:07,000
You're gonna be so healthy.

815
00:46:09,860 --> 00:46:12,900
Oh my god, what the fuck was he trying to do?

816
00:46:13,660 --> 00:46:14,860
Is he dead yet?

817
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:15,980
Oh, there he is.

818
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:17,860
Alright.

819
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:20,040
Everything is fine.

820
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:21,600
Everything is okay.

821
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:24,500
Everything is fine.

822
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:28,060
Everything is okay.

823
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:48,100
Alright, that's fine.

824
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:49,240
I don't think we should have...

825
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:51,980
Guys, why did we all just stood there and let this happen?

826
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:55,220
Why did we all...

827
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:59,020
I'm fine with stalling a little longer.

828
00:46:59,660 --> 00:47:05,460
Oh my god, we just stood there.

829
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:10,100
Just got fucking, like, eaten up in that hallway.

830
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:18,520
Alright, this is fine.

831
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:24,580
Your Curse of Ra actually fucking built, like, stacked upon each other.

832
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:27,420
Because I have three support players on my team.

833
00:47:27,860 --> 00:47:29,200
I, like, I...

834
00:47:30,860 --> 00:47:32,140
I'm gonna go crazy.

835
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:34,980
I'm gonna...

836
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:35,580
Alright.

837
00:47:37,460 --> 00:47:39,300
I'm gonna fucking...

838
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:39,800
Alright.

839
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:41,320
Woah.

840
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:42,740
Okay.

841
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:45,120
Wait, do we have...

842
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:45,820
Nope.

843
00:47:46,260 --> 00:47:48,120
I was gonna say, do we have...

844
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:49,440
Nope.

845
00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:53,060
We don't have Mantis ulti, die first.

846
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:54,180
Why?

847
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:55,900
Wait, why?

848
00:47:57,120 --> 00:47:57,740
Why?

849
00:47:58,060 --> 00:47:59,300
Oh my god.

850
00:47:59,480 --> 00:47:59,780
Why?

851
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:00,800
Okay, oh wait, that's...

852
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:01,780
Oh my god.

853
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:02,860
Why?

854
00:48:08,180 --> 00:48:09,980
We're trickling down.

855
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:15,240
Alright.

856
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:16,120
Alright.

857
00:48:17,130 --> 00:48:17,540
Okay.

858
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:23,450
You're fine.

859
00:48:25,130 --> 00:48:26,770
We're so fine.

860
00:48:28,570 --> 00:48:29,990
We're so fine.

861
00:48:31,150 --> 00:48:32,650
We're so fucking fine.

862
00:48:33,370 --> 00:48:34,450
Okay, he missed.

863
00:48:34,650 --> 00:48:35,630
Yeah, we're so healthy.

864
00:48:36,510 --> 00:48:37,570
He actually missed.

865
00:48:39,950 --> 00:48:41,190
There we go.

866
00:48:45,940 --> 00:48:47,800
Please, she's actually one.

867
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:50,720
Please, like...

868
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:53,740
Please, guys.

869
00:48:54,220 --> 00:48:55,380
I will sit here.

870
00:48:57,540 --> 00:48:58,500
There we go.

871
00:49:00,180 --> 00:49:02,420
I'm sitting here in case I have to rez.

872
00:49:03,020 --> 00:49:04,420
I'm sitting here.

873
00:49:07,100 --> 00:49:08,320
Guys, I don't...

874
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:10,020
I don't know about sitting there.

875
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:11,660
Guys, I...

876
00:49:11,660 --> 00:49:13,460
First time it didn't work.

877
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:16,160
I don't know what is gonna be different this time around.

878
00:49:20,060 --> 00:49:22,300
What's gonna be different this time?

879
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:23,480
I don't understand.

880
00:49:26,220 --> 00:49:26,620
Wait.

881
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:27,400
Killed one, killed one.

882
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:29,440
Whoa.

883
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:32,340
There we go.

884
00:49:33,420 --> 00:49:34,680
Wait, are they walking apart?

885
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:36,360
Solo, solo, guys.

886
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:37,260
Solo, there's one.

887
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:38,000
Please.

888
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:42,300
I'm ulting that one, though.

889
00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:44,120
Throw one, throw one, throw one.

890
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:45,140
We're so low.

891
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:45,840
Look at the rune, look at the rune.

892
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:46,740
Don't swing, don't swing.

893
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:51,720
Okay, like, I don't know what you want me to do.

894
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:54,580
Okay, I feel like I need...

895
00:49:54,580 --> 00:49:55,780
This is a rez situation.

896
00:49:56,500 --> 00:49:58,780
This is definitely a rez situation.

897
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:01,920
This is a rez situation right there.

898
00:50:12,630 --> 00:50:13,590
This is...

899
00:50:13,590 --> 00:50:16,130
Get on, get on, get on, get on.

900
00:50:17,390 --> 00:50:18,250
Get on.

901
00:50:20,510 --> 00:50:21,370
Get on.

902
00:50:22,810 --> 00:50:24,570
Oh my god.

903
00:50:26,430 --> 00:50:28,930
Oh my god.

904
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:38,340
Oh, that's huge, that's huge.

905
00:50:38,620 --> 00:50:39,320
That's huge.

906
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:41,260
That's so huge.

907
00:50:41,980 --> 00:50:43,660
That's so huge.

908
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:45,640
I did that.

909
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:50,860
I did that.

910
00:50:51,860 --> 00:50:53,380
I did that.

911
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:57,140
Oh my god, I fucking did that.

912
00:51:01,710 --> 00:51:02,930
I did it.

913
00:51:02,970 --> 00:51:04,410
I rest my team.

914
00:51:05,670 --> 00:51:08,510
I fucking rest my team.

915
00:51:09,010 --> 00:51:15,210
I can't believe...

916
00:51:15,950 --> 00:51:17,690
I still can't believe...

917
00:51:17,690 --> 00:51:19,030
Mac went storm.

918
00:51:19,310 --> 00:51:21,710
His comp stopped working.

919
00:51:22,490 --> 00:51:25,890
And then we had three supports last game.

920
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:34,410
You actually stacked up all the fucking curses possible in that one fucking game.

921
00:51:34,810 --> 00:51:35,690
That's actually...

922
00:51:39,570 --> 00:51:44,630
This is why all three of you, all three of you deserve that one fucking weak ban.

923
00:51:49,010 --> 00:51:49,770
Okay.

924
00:51:50,370 --> 00:51:52,050
Don't worry, I'll come.

925
00:51:52,410 --> 00:51:55,250
Suddenly fucking game doesn't allow them to come.

926
00:51:56,310 --> 00:51:56,690
Alright.

927
00:51:57,550 --> 00:51:58,070
Here we go.

928
00:51:59,310 --> 00:51:59,970
It's fine.

929
00:52:00,670 --> 00:52:01,410
It's fine.

930
00:52:04,710 --> 00:52:05,850
Don't worry.

931
00:52:06,750 --> 00:52:09,010
Don't worry, I believe in us.

932
00:52:09,570 --> 00:52:11,990
We're a fucking team.

933
00:52:12,590 --> 00:52:13,710
I believe.

934
00:52:13,710 --> 00:52:13,970
I believe.

935
00:52:17,390 --> 00:52:18,810
Oh my god, he's okay.

936
00:52:19,150 --> 00:52:21,670
Oh my god, he's so okay.

937
00:52:23,650 --> 00:52:25,330
He's so healthy.

938
00:52:28,770 --> 00:52:29,530
Okay.

939
00:52:31,550 --> 00:52:34,570
Oh my god, I was not okay.

940
00:52:35,670 --> 00:52:37,370
I'm gonna un-cocoon.

941
00:52:38,370 --> 00:52:41,110
We had no support ults for this.

942
00:52:42,650 --> 00:52:43,490
Alright.

943
00:52:43,970 --> 00:52:44,310
It's fine.

944
00:52:45,030 --> 00:52:45,650
It's fine.

945
00:52:46,410 --> 00:52:47,650
It's fine.

946
00:52:48,250 --> 00:52:49,790
Yes, don't worry.

947
00:52:50,170 --> 00:52:51,430
Don't worry.

948
00:52:51,710 --> 00:52:54,990
We just need...

949
00:52:56,350 --> 00:52:57,190
Holy...

950
00:53:00,070 --> 00:53:02,650
I'm snapping, I'm snapping my hands.

951
00:53:07,410 --> 00:53:07,830
Alright.

952
00:53:08,430 --> 00:53:10,430
I'm dead, but that's okay.

953
00:53:10,650 --> 00:53:11,030
You...

954
00:53:11,030 --> 00:53:11,570
Okay.

955
00:53:11,990 --> 00:53:12,590
Nevermind.

956
00:53:12,590 --> 00:53:15,830
You might have needed me, but that's okay.

957
00:53:16,910 --> 00:53:19,370
I don't think they live.

958
00:53:19,910 --> 00:53:21,910
No, they definitely do not live.

959
00:53:22,070 --> 00:53:24,850
No, they definitely are dead dead.

960
00:53:25,030 --> 00:53:26,610
I might be dead dead too.

961
00:53:27,350 --> 00:53:28,050
I'll cocoon.

962
00:53:29,670 --> 00:53:31,330
Please don't look at me.

963
00:53:32,270 --> 00:53:32,870
Please.

964
00:53:33,150 --> 00:53:34,090
No, Mantis.

965
00:53:34,210 --> 00:53:36,030
Why did you cocoon, Mantis?

966
00:53:36,230 --> 00:53:38,350
Get over here, Mantis.

967
00:53:38,590 --> 00:53:40,890
Oh my god, you won your 1v1.

968
00:53:41,110 --> 00:53:42,190
That's my support.

969
00:53:42,990 --> 00:53:43,770
Trio.

970
00:53:49,330 --> 00:53:49,850
Okay, Mantis.

971
00:53:50,090 --> 00:53:51,810
Our tank is over here.

972
00:53:52,470 --> 00:53:53,270
Our tank.

973
00:53:55,830 --> 00:53:57,230
Oh, we're fine.

974
00:53:57,330 --> 00:53:57,750
You're fine.

975
00:53:57,870 --> 00:53:58,830
You're so fine.

976
00:54:02,610 --> 00:54:03,710
That's fine.

977
00:54:05,970 --> 00:54:09,330
As long as we're all okay, right?

978
00:54:10,890 --> 00:54:11,670
Right?

979
00:54:11,670 --> 00:54:13,930
Are we all okay?

980
00:54:15,250 --> 00:54:17,010
Oh, we are not okay.

981
00:54:17,990 --> 00:54:18,510
Nevermind.

982
00:54:19,030 --> 00:54:19,550
Nevermind.

983
00:54:19,770 --> 00:54:20,470
I thought...

984
00:54:20,470 --> 00:54:22,750
I didn't realize she was still gonna run at us.

985
00:54:22,870 --> 00:54:23,210
I...

986
00:54:23,210 --> 00:54:23,910
I really...

987
00:54:28,110 --> 00:54:29,670
Oh, but we opened the portal.

988
00:54:29,850 --> 00:54:30,630
We won't have...

989
00:54:30,630 --> 00:54:31,710
Oh, no.

990
00:54:32,310 --> 00:54:33,090
No, strange.

991
00:54:33,310 --> 00:54:34,830
We shouldn't open the portal.

992
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:37,210
Okay.

993
00:54:37,210 --> 00:54:37,770
Okay.

994
00:54:39,190 --> 00:54:41,210
The portal might be...

995
00:54:41,770 --> 00:54:42,970
Yeah, I was gonna say.

996
00:54:43,110 --> 00:54:46,010
This is definitely a bad idea.

997
00:54:47,270 --> 00:54:48,710
I was gonna say.

998
00:54:49,370 --> 00:54:50,810
The portal is not it.

999
00:54:51,290 --> 00:54:53,670
The portal is definitely not it.

1000
00:54:58,530 --> 00:55:00,290
Alright, who cursed me again?

1001
00:55:00,990 --> 00:55:04,550
Guys, who were the new cursers that cursed this game?

1002
00:55:05,830 --> 00:55:06,730
Who was it?

1003
00:55:12,490 --> 00:55:14,010
Give me the names.

1004
00:55:14,150 --> 00:55:18,370
I hope my mods are writing down who cursed this one.

1005
00:55:18,830 --> 00:55:21,750
Alright, the more curses you put, the longer the ban is gonna get.

1006
00:55:22,070 --> 00:55:22,690
I need...

1007
00:55:22,690 --> 00:55:24,410
I need you guys to know that.

1008
00:55:24,810 --> 00:55:27,390
So, like, whoever cursed this game, one month.

1009
00:55:28,670 --> 00:55:30,010
No, two weeks.

1010
00:55:34,950 --> 00:55:35,550
Whoever...

1011
00:55:35,550 --> 00:55:38,050
Whoever cursed this, two weeks.

1012
00:55:38,050 --> 00:55:38,870
Two...

1013
00:55:38,870 --> 00:55:42,530
I need you guys to learn.

1014
00:55:42,930 --> 00:55:46,730
I need you guys to learn not to curse me no more.

1015
00:55:49,870 --> 00:55:53,230
Oh, you guys...

1016
00:55:53,230 --> 00:55:54,910
You guys wonder why it's two weeks?

1017
00:55:55,090 --> 00:55:59,270
Cause some of you didn't learn from the first two bans.

1018
00:55:59,790 --> 00:56:01,850
This is my naughty list.

1019
00:56:02,750 --> 00:56:03,450
Someone...

1020
00:56:03,450 --> 00:56:07,450
Someone didn't learn about after the first two bans.

1021
00:56:07,450 --> 00:56:09,610
Yeah, you're here yet again.

1022
00:56:15,270 --> 00:56:16,810
You guys gotta know.

1023
00:56:20,090 --> 00:56:23,550
We should be, like, okay, right?

1024
00:56:24,370 --> 00:56:33,430
We technically should be okay.

1025
00:56:36,230 --> 00:56:37,270
Alright.

1026
00:56:42,300 --> 00:56:44,060
Jesus Christ.

1027
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:46,140
Alright.

1028
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:48,840
We gotta avoid some...

1029
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:50,900
We gotta avoid some people here.

1030
00:56:51,260 --> 00:56:52,310
Like, I can't...

1031
00:56:54,170 --> 00:56:55,940
I can't fucking...

1032
00:56:55,940 --> 00:56:58,040
Oh my god.

1033
00:56:58,300 --> 00:56:59,060
How...

1034
00:56:59,060 --> 00:57:00,680
How many...

1035
00:57:00,680 --> 00:57:01,660
How...

1036
00:57:01,660 --> 00:57:03,660
What is going on?

1037
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:04,740
How...

1038
00:57:04,740 --> 00:57:06,660
I can't see anything!

1039
00:57:13,120 --> 00:57:14,140
Oh my god.

1040
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:15,100
Huge whale.

1041
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:19,480
Oh my god.

1042
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,800
Oh my god.

1043
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:24,100
See you in two weeks!

1044
00:57:30,140 --> 00:57:32,480
You guys better have learned your lesson.

1045
00:57:39,140 --> 00:57:40,460
Just remember...

1046
00:57:41,460 --> 00:57:43,140
Just remember...

1047
00:57:55,390 --> 00:57:56,830
Just remember...

1048
00:57:57,310 --> 00:57:59,710
Guys, where did everybody go?

1049
00:58:00,630 --> 00:58:01,190
Where...

1050
00:58:01,190 --> 00:58:03,930
Where did everybody go?

1051
00:58:06,330 --> 00:58:07,670
Where did...

1052
00:58:09,290 --> 00:58:10,890
Where did everybody...

1053
00:58:11,130 --> 00:58:12,170
Okay, we're...

1054
00:58:12,170 --> 00:58:13,710
Okay, that's where everybody went.

1055
00:58:13,710 --> 00:58:16,350
I was gonna say, where did everyone go?

1056
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:22,680
Oh my god, he's, like, actual low.

1057
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:28,040
Oh my god.

1058
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:33,860
Come on!

1059
00:58:35,380 --> 00:58:37,780
Guys, I don't think we're winning this one.

1060
00:58:37,940 --> 00:58:38,200
I...

1061
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:39,660
I don't think we're...

1062
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:40,960
Guys...

1063
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:42,100
I've actually...

1064
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:44,300
I think I've actually lost hope.

1065
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:51,620
I...

1066
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:53,760
I think...

1067
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:55,140
I think it's over.

1068
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:00,540
Oh my god.

1069
00:59:00,860 --> 00:59:02,780
It's just you and I.

1070
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:08,720
It's just you and I.

1071
00:59:12,180 --> 00:59:15,060
I'm avoiding one of the supports.

1072
00:59:25,640 --> 00:59:26,020
I...

1073
00:59:26,420 --> 00:59:26,800
I...

1074
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:29,620
I keep wearing one game off.

1075
00:59:30,940 --> 00:59:32,680
Oh my god.

1076
00:59:33,460 --> 00:59:35,700
I can't believe it.

1077
00:59:37,260 --> 00:59:38,680
Oh my god.

1078
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:40,460
That was three games off.

1079
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:42,400
Who was it?

1080
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:42,720
Alright.

1081
00:59:43,260 --> 00:59:45,160
Write the name for the one...

1082
00:59:45,340 --> 00:59:46,500
For the two week ban.

1083
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:47,280
The...

1084
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:48,520
The second game...

1085
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:49,420
This next game.

1086
00:59:49,740 --> 00:59:52,900
If you curse me and I lose this game...

1087
00:59:52,900 --> 00:59:55,140
That's a three week ban.

1088
00:59:55,540 --> 00:59:59,300
That's a fucking three week ban.

1089
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:02,660
You have to learn.

1090
01:00:02,820 --> 01:00:04,160
You guys have to learn.

1091
01:00:07,580 --> 01:00:10,980
I literally needed one game.

1092
01:00:11,720 --> 01:00:14,320
I just needed one game.

1093
01:00:15,460 --> 01:00:18,960
And then you stacked all the bans together.

1094
01:00:19,900 --> 01:00:23,440
You actually stacked it all together.

1095
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:26,100
Oh my god.

1096
01:00:30,660 --> 01:00:31,300
Please.

1097
01:00:31,500 --> 01:00:32,760
I need counter curse.

1098
01:00:32,860 --> 01:00:33,840
I need like...

1099
01:00:33,840 --> 01:00:36,680
Counter curses to the Curse of Ra, chat.

1100
01:00:37,360 --> 01:00:38,280
I need...

1101
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:38,960
I need...

1102
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:39,580
Guys, please.

1103
01:00:39,700 --> 01:00:40,600
We need a counter.

1104
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:43,060
We need a counter all the curses.

1105
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:46,260
If you counter the Curse of Ra...

1106
01:00:46,260 --> 01:00:48,700
If you counter the Curse of Ra...

1107
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:50,460
I will...

1108
01:00:50,460 --> 01:00:51,460
I will...

1109
01:00:51,460 --> 01:00:52,540
I will acknowledge you.

1110
01:00:52,660 --> 01:00:53,940
I will put your name...

1111
01:00:54,440 --> 01:00:55,620
On the...

1112
01:00:55,620 --> 01:00:56,640
Ending screen.

1113
01:00:57,780 --> 01:00:59,760
Oh, we got CrashBad.

1114
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,740
He plays Tank but he always...

1115
01:01:02,740 --> 01:01:03,140
Why?

1116
01:01:06,420 --> 01:01:07,860
Who was it?

1117
01:01:08,260 --> 01:01:09,200
Who was it?

1118
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:10,700
Who the fuck?

1119
01:01:13,360 --> 01:01:15,000
Who did this?

1120
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:19,100
Alright, write the names down.

1121
01:01:19,500 --> 01:01:21,200
This is the three week.

1122
01:01:21,220 --> 01:01:22,640
Do you want to take the gamble?

1123
01:01:24,620 --> 01:01:26,740
I need the Hawkeye.

1124
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:30,640
I need the fucking counter curses.

1125
01:01:31,180 --> 01:01:34,000
I hope my mods are writing their names down.

1126
01:01:34,280 --> 01:01:36,000
Do like a 20%.

1127
01:01:42,100 --> 01:01:43,260
Holy shit.

1128
01:01:43,260 --> 01:01:43,900
Oh.

1129
01:01:45,820 --> 01:01:48,320
I'm gonna fucking go crazy.

1130
01:01:48,780 --> 01:01:51,800
I'm gonna go crazy for this game.

1131
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:53,600
You curse me on this game?

1132
01:01:53,860 --> 01:01:54,420
Three weeks.

1133
01:01:54,780 --> 01:01:55,380
Three weeks.

1134
01:01:55,480 --> 01:01:57,540
I'm going up every week.

1135
01:01:59,860 --> 01:02:02,200
I'm going up every week.

1136
01:02:02,320 --> 01:02:03,580
I'm going every game.

1137
01:02:03,660 --> 01:02:04,740
I'm going up a week.

1138
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:05,940
I can't.

1139
01:02:07,660 --> 01:02:10,660
You might as well just make a new account at this point.

1140
01:02:10,660 --> 01:02:16,540
If you want to talk in my chat again.

1141
01:02:16,700 --> 01:02:18,800
You might as well just make a new account.

1142
01:02:22,980 --> 01:02:25,660
Or you'll never be able to interact here.

1143
01:02:28,860 --> 01:02:32,900
You'll never be able to interact in this chat at this point.

1144
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:35,820
I thought so too.

1145
01:02:44,180 --> 01:02:44,740
Alright.

1146
01:02:47,720 --> 01:02:49,940
Doki's chat becomes unreadable.

1147
01:02:49,940 --> 01:02:52,100
Do you just want to teleport top or do you just want to walk down mid?

1148
01:02:55,640 --> 01:02:55,920
Alright.

1149
01:02:58,020 --> 01:02:59,120
Here we go.

1150
01:03:04,900 --> 01:03:05,920
I'm gonna teleport here.

1151
01:03:06,080 --> 01:03:06,380
Alright.

1152
01:03:08,080 --> 01:03:08,860
Let's go.

1153
01:03:09,460 --> 01:03:11,180
There's a Luna set up top.

1154
01:03:11,180 --> 01:03:12,260
Let's fucking go.

1155
01:03:16,460 --> 01:03:18,120
What the fuck?

1156
01:03:18,500 --> 01:03:20,080
It like glitched out for me.

1157
01:03:20,200 --> 01:03:21,040
That was so weird.

1158
01:03:22,660 --> 01:03:23,800
Oh, they have a magic?

1159
01:03:25,460 --> 01:03:25,680
Oh!

1160
01:03:26,680 --> 01:03:28,600
Oh my god!

1161
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:30,920
Oh!

1162
01:03:32,120 --> 01:03:33,440
My god!

1163
01:03:39,560 --> 01:03:41,260
There's so much damage.

1164
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:42,880
There's so much damage.

1165
01:03:43,620 --> 01:03:44,540
Magic dead.

1166
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:46,480
Yeah, but five of us are dead.

1167
01:03:50,670 --> 01:03:53,070
Oh my god.

1168
01:03:55,710 --> 01:03:57,330
Yeah, the magic's dead.

1169
01:03:57,610 --> 01:03:57,850
Yeah.

1170
01:03:58,550 --> 01:03:58,950
Yeah.

1171
01:03:59,110 --> 01:04:03,450
I wish we had like, you know, an equal amount of trade there too.

1172
01:04:05,390 --> 01:04:05,690
Oh!

1173
01:04:08,970 --> 01:04:10,610
Oh my god.

1174
01:04:12,690 --> 01:04:13,810
Oh my god.

1175
01:04:15,210 --> 01:04:16,630
I have no shield.

1176
01:04:16,690 --> 01:04:16,930
No shield.

1177
01:04:17,050 --> 01:04:17,270
No shield.

1178
01:04:18,590 --> 01:04:19,710
Jesus Christ.

1179
01:04:21,850 --> 01:04:22,970
Jesus Christ.

1180
01:04:23,310 --> 01:04:24,210
Why don't you guys walk in?

1181
01:04:24,530 --> 01:04:25,150
I'm walking.

1182
01:04:25,190 --> 01:04:25,490
I'm walking.

1183
01:04:26,410 --> 01:04:27,970
I don't do that.

1184
01:04:29,410 --> 01:04:30,470
I'm gonna try to kill that guy.

1185
01:04:30,750 --> 01:04:31,430
I'm frozen.

1186
01:04:32,810 --> 01:04:34,070
Oh my god!

1187
01:04:34,270 --> 01:04:35,070
I'm fighting.

1188
01:04:35,590 --> 01:04:37,090
Bro, I'm fucking...

1189
01:04:37,090 --> 01:04:38,930
I'm frozen too!

1190
01:04:45,410 --> 01:04:47,310
Our fucking naughty list.

1191
01:04:48,010 --> 01:04:49,850
Our fucking naughty list.

1192
01:04:50,030 --> 01:04:53,630
I will recruit a third person if it means I have to get out of here.

1193
01:04:55,910 --> 01:04:56,390
Please.

1194
01:04:56,930 --> 01:04:57,210
Please.

1195
01:04:57,810 --> 01:04:59,910
It will take up god of war time.

1196
01:05:00,310 --> 01:05:01,830
Guys, the more you curse me...

1197
01:05:04,070 --> 01:05:06,190
The less god of war you get.

1198
01:05:06,930 --> 01:05:07,510
I'll give you...

1199
01:05:07,510 --> 01:05:11,450
Alright, I was planning on doing a four hour god of war stream.

1200
01:05:11,610 --> 01:05:13,010
I just need you guys to know that.

1201
01:05:13,010 --> 01:05:16,650
The more you stall this...

1202
01:05:16,650 --> 01:05:21,710
It will take up a god of war time slot.

1203
01:05:24,510 --> 01:05:25,690
That's right.

1204
01:05:27,730 --> 01:05:28,670
There's more...

1205
01:05:28,670 --> 01:05:29,990
Are you serious?

1206
01:05:30,730 --> 01:05:31,490
Are you...

1207
01:05:31,490 --> 01:05:33,010
Oh my god.

1208
01:05:33,190 --> 01:05:34,470
We're so fucking dead in here.

1209
01:05:34,790 --> 01:05:35,330
We're so...

1210
01:05:35,890 --> 01:05:37,290
Chris, I died.

1211
01:05:40,550 --> 01:05:42,550
Why did you...

1212
01:05:42,550 --> 01:05:44,350
Why did you put it there?

1213
01:05:44,990 --> 01:05:47,070
What do you mean you're lagging?

1214
01:05:47,610 --> 01:05:50,330
Why did all the curses build up to you?

1215
01:05:55,470 --> 01:05:57,830
I have a teleport in nine if you want to try that again.

1216
01:05:58,330 --> 01:06:01,250
No, I do not want to try that again.

1217
01:06:06,350 --> 01:06:08,450
We can get our Adam and poke it out.

1218
01:06:09,830 --> 01:06:10,830
Our Bucky.

1219
01:06:12,550 --> 01:06:13,110
Alright.

1220
01:06:13,630 --> 01:06:15,190
Oh my god, thank you for the counter curse.

1221
01:06:15,370 --> 01:06:15,710
Thank you.

1222
01:06:15,830 --> 01:06:17,370
Thank you for the counter curse.

1223
01:06:17,450 --> 01:06:18,790
I really appreciate it.

1224
01:06:19,030 --> 01:06:20,310
Thank you so much.

1225
01:06:20,770 --> 01:06:25,210
Thank you for counter cursing this fucking hellhole that I'm trapped in.

1226
01:06:25,630 --> 01:06:27,890
This purgatory that I'm trapped in.

1227
01:06:29,270 --> 01:06:31,070
I really appreciate it.

1228
01:06:32,610 --> 01:06:34,350
I really appreciate it.

1229
01:06:37,150 --> 01:06:38,490
Oh my god.

1230
01:06:38,490 --> 01:06:40,700
Oh my god.

1231
01:06:41,150 --> 01:06:44,490
I got judge, jury, executioner.

1232
01:06:52,810 --> 01:06:53,890
Four games.

1233
01:06:54,830 --> 01:06:57,390
We're at four games now, chat.

1234
01:06:57,670 --> 01:06:58,950
We're at...

1235
01:06:58,950 --> 01:07:00,310
I can force touch point.

1236
01:07:00,410 --> 01:07:00,970
You have to.

1237
01:07:01,010 --> 01:07:01,450
You have to.

1238
01:07:03,110 --> 01:07:04,690
There's magic behind all of us.

1239
01:07:08,610 --> 01:07:09,790
Sorry Adam.

1240
01:07:10,430 --> 01:07:12,030
I'm gonna lose it.

1241
01:07:12,610 --> 01:07:14,570
I'm gonna lose it.

1242
01:07:15,590 --> 01:07:18,010
That one game was the game.

1243
01:07:18,370 --> 01:07:21,310
That one game was the game.

1244
01:07:21,670 --> 01:07:24,830
That was actually the game.

1245
01:07:25,630 --> 01:07:27,050
Oh my god.

1246
01:07:29,250 --> 01:07:31,750
Who was the one that cursed me on that one game?

1247
01:07:32,030 --> 01:07:33,270
Change it to one month.

1248
01:07:36,410 --> 01:07:37,550
All the people.

1249
01:07:38,090 --> 01:07:38,990
That one game.

1250
01:07:39,330 --> 01:07:40,510
That's gotta be the hard.

1251
01:07:40,650 --> 01:07:41,690
Change it to one month.

1252
01:07:41,750 --> 01:07:43,110
That's not one week anymore.

1253
01:07:43,310 --> 01:07:44,630
It's one month.

1254
01:07:46,810 --> 01:07:47,370
What?

1255
01:07:48,750 --> 01:07:50,090
That one game.

1256
01:07:50,310 --> 01:07:53,750
That one game where I was one game away back to GM one.

1257
01:07:54,150 --> 01:07:55,090
They gotta learn.

1258
01:07:55,490 --> 01:07:56,410
They gotta learn.

1259
01:07:56,990 --> 01:07:57,670
That was Lord Kuro's.

1260
01:07:57,790 --> 01:07:58,930
Now it's one month.

1261
01:08:01,510 --> 01:08:02,950
How is he innocent?

1262
01:08:02,950 --> 01:08:05,070
How is he innocent?

1263
01:08:05,670 --> 01:08:08,250
He knew exactly what he was doing.

1264
01:08:08,430 --> 01:08:10,290
And he still did it.

1265
01:08:11,050 --> 01:08:12,570
Two hours later.

1266
01:08:12,990 --> 01:08:14,370
Change it to a year.

1267
01:08:17,770 --> 01:08:19,290
He is not innocent.

1268
01:08:19,890 --> 01:08:22,030
You are not protecting a criminal.

1269
01:08:22,630 --> 01:08:26,710
You are not protecting a fucking criminal in my chat.

1270
01:08:27,510 --> 01:08:32,130
I didn't lie.

1271
01:08:32,130 --> 01:08:35,450
I was gonna fucking play God of War right after.

1272
01:08:35,990 --> 01:08:37,150
But somebody.

1273
01:08:37,990 --> 01:08:38,810
Not even somebody.

1274
01:08:39,130 --> 01:08:41,610
A couple of you guys were like.

1275
01:08:41,710 --> 01:08:45,090
Would it be funny if she plays a little longer?

1276
01:08:45,890 --> 01:08:51,730
Let me fucking give her as much bad luck as possible.

1277
01:08:57,150 --> 01:08:57,790
Okay.

1278
01:08:58,010 --> 01:08:59,970
I don't know what you want but.

1279
01:09:03,590 --> 01:09:04,310
Yep.

1280
01:09:04,850 --> 01:09:05,050
Yep.

1281
01:09:05,250 --> 01:09:05,510
Sure.

1282
01:09:06,890 --> 01:09:08,770
I don't feel like I'm winning.

1283
01:09:09,090 --> 01:09:09,870
I don't.

1284
01:09:09,870 --> 01:09:11,910
I don't feel like I'm winning.

1285
01:09:12,170 --> 01:09:12,970
Not gonna lie.

1286
01:09:16,890 --> 01:09:18,490
Oh my God.

1287
01:09:21,310 --> 01:09:23,330
Oh my God.

1288
01:09:25,470 --> 01:09:27,270
Oh my God.

1289
01:09:27,830 --> 01:09:29,510
We're alive.

1290
01:09:30,450 --> 01:09:32,950
For like one more round.

1291
01:09:34,050 --> 01:09:35,830
Oh my God.

1292
01:09:36,370 --> 01:09:39,490
I can't believe we're alive for one more fight.

1293
01:09:40,190 --> 01:09:41,770
I can't believe it guys.

1294
01:09:42,450 --> 01:09:47,510
I can't believe we're alive for one more round.

1295
01:09:53,450 --> 01:09:55,210
Oh the fuck?

1296
01:10:02,490 --> 01:10:03,590
Oh.

1297
01:10:04,310 --> 01:10:05,410
Yeah.

1298
01:10:06,420 --> 01:10:06,970
Oh.

1299
01:10:08,240 --> 01:10:09,350
My God.

1300
01:10:09,770 --> 01:10:14,450
I'm fucking scroll wheeling it so fucking hard right now.

1301
01:10:23,320 --> 01:10:25,750
Alright we're fucking dead.

1302
01:10:25,930 --> 01:10:27,290
We're so dead.

1303
01:10:27,390 --> 01:10:28,510
Goodbye everybody.

1304
01:10:28,510 --> 01:10:32,990
Goodbye everybody.

1305
01:10:37,350 --> 01:10:40,050
We've got a war going on.

1306
01:10:40,710 --> 01:10:43,110
We've got a war.

1307
01:10:45,710 --> 01:10:48,990
I can't believe this is a God.

1308
01:10:49,350 --> 01:10:50,630
No guys.

1309
01:10:50,810 --> 01:10:52,030
I swear to God.

1310
01:10:52,970 --> 01:10:55,270
We just need Counter Curse.

1311
01:10:55,370 --> 01:10:56,010
Exactly!

1312
01:10:56,630 --> 01:10:57,590
Dude you know what?

1313
01:10:57,590 --> 01:11:03,910
Everyone that cataclyses, you're maude for the- for like, you're maude for the day.

1314
01:11:07,190 --> 01:11:11,630
All the cataclyses, I'm giving you maude for the day.

1315
01:11:12,270 --> 01:11:15,810
Ain't no way.

1316
01:11:16,350 --> 01:11:17,390
That's right.

1317
01:11:18,190 --> 01:11:20,950
Don't- dude, I'm just kidding.

1318
01:11:21,310 --> 01:11:23,190
Despy's gone mad.

1319
01:11:23,710 --> 01:11:24,350
That's right.

1320
01:11:25,370 --> 01:11:26,010
Congratulations!

1321
01:11:27,910 --> 01:11:31,870
You get to start a chat war.

1322
01:11:32,310 --> 01:11:33,590
That's actually right.

1323
01:11:34,150 --> 01:11:37,590
I'm gonna start the biggest fucking war in my chat.

1324
01:11:38,090 --> 01:11:39,130
But don't keep being cursed.

1325
01:11:39,330 --> 01:11:40,490
All right, this game?

1326
01:11:40,890 --> 01:11:41,650
Four weeks.

1327
01:11:42,610 --> 01:11:44,550
Four weeks, this game.

1328
01:11:45,050 --> 01:11:46,890
All right, June, congratulations.

1329
01:11:47,070 --> 01:11:48,130
You're maude for the day.

1330
01:11:52,430 --> 01:11:55,310
I hate Hello, but I hate Spider-Man at the same time.

1331
01:11:56,050 --> 01:11:56,070
Congratulations!

1332
01:11:57,430 --> 01:11:58,630
Maude for the day.

1333
01:11:59,970 --> 01:12:02,050
All right, Sandor Maude, there you go.

1334
01:12:08,690 --> 01:12:10,010
All right, there you go.

1335
01:12:10,170 --> 01:12:13,450
Congratulations, maude for the- no, no, maude for the stream.

1336
01:12:13,750 --> 01:12:15,370
No, I shouldn't do maude for the day.

1337
01:12:15,410 --> 01:12:16,490
That's actually pretty fucked up.

1338
01:12:16,490 --> 01:12:20,250
Maude for the rest of the stream, and then we unmaude you right after the stream.

1339
01:12:20,510 --> 01:12:22,030
Maude for the rest of the stream.

1340
01:12:27,990 --> 01:12:29,910
I have fucking lost it.

1341
01:12:30,270 --> 01:12:32,410
I- I've absolutely lost it.

1342
01:12:32,430 --> 01:12:34,170
I need- I need to get out of here.

1343
01:12:34,310 --> 01:12:35,610
I need to get to GM1.

1344
01:12:36,010 --> 01:12:38,070
I- I like get lazy.

1345
01:12:38,430 --> 01:12:38,790
What?

1346
01:12:39,210 --> 01:12:41,330
All right, you get to be maude for the rest of the stream.

1347
01:12:41,330 --> 01:12:43,330
I'll rip- don't worry, I'll remove it right after.

1348
01:12:45,050 --> 01:12:48,750
Oh shit, wait, you're right.

1349
01:12:49,290 --> 01:12:50,350
Wait, no, they can't.

1350
01:12:50,370 --> 01:12:52,490
They don't have the power to unban, only I do.

1351
01:12:53,010 --> 01:12:55,230
Only I have the power to unban.

1352
01:12:55,710 --> 01:13:01,610
A discord admin reneged me from Marvel Rivals to conquer it, so I'll ramp up the curse and extend the ban.

1353
01:13:02,070 --> 01:13:03,070
A blessing.

1354
01:13:03,970 --> 01:13:06,270
All right, maude for the rest of the stream.

1355
01:13:07,110 --> 01:13:10,270
Congratulations, maude for the rest of the stream.

1356
01:13:14,490 --> 01:13:17,030
Four weeks and a month is the same.

1357
01:13:19,670 --> 01:13:21,010
All right, here we go.

1358
01:13:23,590 --> 01:13:28,170
If I- if you unban, okay, also the maude's who are like maude for the rest of the day.

1359
01:13:28,830 --> 01:13:30,050
Maude's for the rest of the day.

1360
01:13:30,350 --> 01:13:36,050
Uh, for the rest of the stream, I will- if you unban any of the people I just banned, I will fuck- your- your maude's getting removed.

1361
01:13:36,230 --> 01:13:40,370
You're- you can't- your maude's getting removed and then you're getting banned.

1362
01:13:42,470 --> 01:13:44,330
That's right, you think I won't do it?

1363
01:13:44,510 --> 01:13:45,550
I'm fucking crazy.

1364
01:13:46,010 --> 01:13:48,570
I'm playing this game since two in the morning.

1365
01:13:48,790 --> 01:13:50,370
Or three in the morning.

1366
01:13:50,790 --> 01:13:55,390
I just- I fucking- I'm- I'm hyped up on gamer subs right now.

1367
01:13:55,810 --> 01:13:57,190
And we have three tanks.

1368
01:13:57,510 --> 01:13:59,950
This is going great.

1369
01:14:04,790 --> 01:14:06,710
I'm fucking- that's right.

1370
01:14:07,930 --> 01:14:10,850
That's right, I'm fucking- it's over.

1371
01:14:11,450 --> 01:14:12,970
That's when you know.

1372
01:14:13,870 --> 01:14:18,250
That's when you know, like, I'm not joking around.

1373
01:14:20,210 --> 01:14:22,170
I'm not fucking around.

1374
01:14:22,410 --> 01:14:23,990
I'm- I'm- I'll do anything.

1375
01:14:30,030 --> 01:14:31,750
That's when you know.

1376
01:14:37,330 --> 01:14:39,010
Oh, where did he go?

1377
01:14:41,410 --> 01:14:42,870
Wait, where did he go?

1378
01:14:43,850 --> 01:14:45,550
Wait, I have to solo heal us.

1379
01:14:46,350 --> 01:14:48,070
Wait, I have to solo heal.

1380
01:14:48,290 --> 01:14:50,010
Wait, the Punisher still died.

1381
01:14:50,590 --> 01:14:52,590
Wait, the Punisher died!

1382
01:14:55,350 --> 01:14:55,930
No,

1383
01:15:01,350 --> 01:15:02,930
wait, no, I will remember to unwind.

1384
01:15:03,090 --> 01:15:03,870
I'll remember.

1385
01:15:05,030 --> 01:15:07,550
I don't think we should go three tanks, guys.

1386
01:15:08,410 --> 01:15:10,250
I don't think so.

1387
01:15:10,410 --> 01:15:14,530
Guys, I actually wanted to play God of War, but like, you don't understand.

1388
01:15:14,850 --> 01:15:17,550
I need to get back my GM1.

1389
01:15:18,010 --> 01:15:19,390
You don't understand.

1390
01:15:20,450 --> 01:15:21,970
Okay, I got focus up, actually.

1391
01:15:22,650 --> 01:15:26,210
I actually need to focus up because we have three fucking tanks.

1392
01:15:26,570 --> 01:15:28,670
Like, how do I heal this?

1393
01:15:29,550 --> 01:15:31,050
How do I heal three?

1394
01:15:31,050 --> 01:15:33,730
Why do we have three tanks?

1395
01:15:35,090 --> 01:15:36,550
It's clearly not working.

1396
01:15:41,450 --> 01:15:43,010
Oh my god.

1397
01:15:45,130 --> 01:15:47,690
Why is Mek on record?

1398
01:15:52,450 --> 01:15:54,230
Oh my god.

1399
01:15:54,350 --> 01:15:56,190
Oh, he hid there.

1400
01:15:57,750 --> 01:15:59,810
Okay, okay, I need to actually focus up now.

1401
01:16:00,350 --> 01:16:06,430
Oh my god, this is actually a game I have to fucking pay attention to because I have to keep three tanks alive.

1402
01:16:07,210 --> 01:16:09,230
Which is not great.

1403
01:16:09,330 --> 01:16:10,670
Oh my god.

1404
01:16:11,030 --> 01:16:16,190
I don't think this is the right idea, guys.

1405
01:16:20,150 --> 01:16:23,090
Oh my god, just shoot everything.

1406
01:16:24,630 --> 01:16:25,990
Just, please.

1407
01:16:26,710 --> 01:16:28,710
I can't even see anything.

1408
01:16:30,270 --> 01:16:32,930
I can't see anything.

1409
01:16:35,350 --> 01:16:37,390
There we go, you should be dead.

1410
01:16:37,910 --> 01:16:39,750
All right, all right.

1411
01:16:40,530 --> 01:16:42,910
I don't think I can tell anyone what just happened that fight.

1412
01:16:42,990 --> 01:16:43,550
Three minutes.

1413
01:16:45,030 --> 01:16:46,490
Three minutes left.

1414
01:16:47,150 --> 01:16:48,730
Psy top here, she just dashed off.

1415
01:16:49,290 --> 01:16:52,990
We have like four, three tank things.

1416
01:16:56,910 --> 01:16:57,950
All right.

1417
01:16:59,810 --> 01:17:00,230
Oh.

1418
01:17:04,110 --> 01:17:06,010
Okay, focus up, Psy.

1419
01:17:19,050 --> 01:17:22,270
You're so healthy.

1420
01:17:24,790 --> 01:17:26,450
You're so healthy.

1421
01:17:28,950 --> 01:17:30,770
You're so healthy.

1422
01:17:32,350 --> 01:17:34,110
You're so healthy.

1423
01:17:34,110 --> 01:17:34,390
You're so healthy.

1424
01:17:37,570 --> 01:17:38,610
All right.

1425
01:17:41,130 --> 01:17:42,390
All right, this is fun.

1426
01:17:42,770 --> 01:17:43,690
This is so fun.

1427
01:17:44,650 --> 01:17:45,510
They know what they did.

1428
01:17:45,850 --> 01:17:47,110
They're in jail for a reason.

1429
01:17:47,510 --> 01:17:49,510
You want me to free a fucking criminal?

1430
01:17:51,730 --> 01:17:52,410
All right.

1431
01:17:56,820 --> 01:17:57,740
All right.

1432
01:17:57,780 --> 01:17:58,300
All right, that's cool.

1433
01:17:59,020 --> 01:18:01,440
I need literally two.

1434
01:18:01,820 --> 01:18:02,600
Okay, I got it.

1435
01:18:02,620 --> 01:18:03,040
I got it.

1436
01:18:03,100 --> 01:18:03,520
I got it.

1437
01:18:03,560 --> 01:18:04,520
I just gotta be alive.

1438
01:18:06,220 --> 01:18:08,860
It's actually a lot harder than you think it will be.

1439
01:18:11,860 --> 01:18:13,260
Oh my god.

1440
01:18:20,160 --> 01:18:20,920
That's fine.

1441
01:18:24,320 --> 01:18:25,500
Not fine.

1442
01:18:28,060 --> 01:18:29,080
That's fine.

1443
01:18:30,820 --> 01:18:31,900
Not fine.

1444
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:34,180
Not fine.

1445
01:18:37,520 --> 01:18:40,280
Okay, I have to save- oh my god.

1446
01:18:40,860 --> 01:18:44,660
I actually- I have to save Manta's ult for Psylocke.

1447
01:18:45,200 --> 01:18:47,580
I can't use it for anything else, which sucks.

1448
01:18:50,120 --> 01:18:58,100
I actually have to save it for- I feel like we need to take better account where that Iron Man is playing.

1449
01:18:58,700 --> 01:19:00,760
Okay, he killed one person.

1450
01:19:01,020 --> 01:19:04,620
Like, it's not like- Bro, bro.

1451
01:19:05,040 --> 01:19:06,420
Bro, I can't.

1452
01:19:06,520 --> 01:19:08,720
Bro, I- I- STOP!

1453
01:19:09,020 --> 01:19:10,780
STOP PEEKING HIM!

1454
01:19:11,760 --> 01:19:15,980
I literally am using every fucking leap on you.

1455
01:19:21,470 --> 01:19:23,210
Like- Iron Man over top of them.

1456
01:19:23,470 --> 01:19:25,110
I don't have enough!

1457
01:19:28,230 --> 01:19:29,490
Psy, name Psy, Psy.

1458
01:19:30,430 --> 01:19:33,370
I don't have enough heals for all of you!

1459
01:19:34,110 --> 01:19:34,550
There's one.

1460
01:19:37,290 --> 01:19:40,550
Oh my god, I didn't want to.

1461
01:19:40,690 --> 01:19:41,850
Watch it, watch it, watch it.

1462
01:19:43,070 --> 01:19:43,650
Nice.

1463
01:19:47,400 --> 01:19:49,320
Oh my god, please.

1464
01:19:52,420 --> 01:19:53,340
Very slow.

1465
01:19:54,880 --> 01:19:55,500
I stunned him.

1466
01:19:55,780 --> 01:19:56,380
Please!

1467
01:19:58,620 --> 01:20:00,120
I stunned her after, I stunned her.

1468
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:01,780
Good sleep?

1469
01:20:01,980 --> 01:20:02,060
Oh yeah.

1470
01:20:02,520 --> 01:20:03,360
She's gonna roll.

1471
01:20:03,620 --> 01:20:04,520
It doesn't matter.

1472
01:20:04,960 --> 01:20:06,340
It doesn't matter.

1473
01:20:10,540 --> 01:20:11,300
Can't you stab?

1474
01:20:13,240 --> 01:20:14,300
Oh my god.

1475
01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:15,160
I'm gonna stun her out of it.

1476
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:16,520
Okay.

1477
01:20:16,980 --> 01:20:17,620
I'm gonna stun.

1478
01:20:18,700 --> 01:20:20,000
Oh, holy fuck.

1479
01:20:20,420 --> 01:20:20,940
Please!

1480
01:20:21,400 --> 01:20:23,200
I don't have enough heals!

1481
01:20:24,400 --> 01:20:25,120
Good ult.

1482
01:20:25,620 --> 01:20:26,300
Straight in her ass.

1483
01:20:29,800 --> 01:20:31,920
Please, I actually don't have enough!

1484
01:20:38,100 --> 01:20:39,520
Oh my god.

1485
01:20:40,460 --> 01:20:41,300
Please.

1486
01:20:43,140 --> 01:20:46,060
I'm stalling it by being on here.

1487
01:20:47,660 --> 01:20:49,320
No, he's one!

1488
01:20:50,080 --> 01:20:51,260
He's one!

1489
01:20:53,020 --> 01:20:53,400
Fuck.

1490
01:20:55,760 --> 01:20:58,260
I was yelling at my chat.

1491
01:20:58,660 --> 01:21:00,420
Why do we have three?

1492
01:21:00,420 --> 01:21:01,660
He's dead.

1493
01:21:01,660 --> 01:21:03,780
He's dead.

1494
01:21:05,420 --> 01:21:09,540
I messed out on this comp.

1495
01:21:14,180 --> 01:21:21,840
My chat cursed the game that would have got me a G1 and won.

1496
01:21:22,540 --> 01:21:25,140
And fucking killed your BC.

1497
01:21:25,140 --> 01:21:25,360
BC.

1498
01:21:29,320 --> 01:21:32,260
Alp is a pro player.

1499
01:21:32,980 --> 01:21:34,420
Let him DPS.

1500
01:21:42,550 --> 01:21:45,150
They are crying!

1501
01:22:00,200 --> 01:22:02,880
I'm banning you from my chat.

1502
01:22:24,130 --> 01:22:26,690
I'm banning you from my chat.

1503
01:22:27,950 --> 01:22:28,670
Oh my god.

1504
01:22:30,230 --> 01:22:33,070
I don't even know what his YouTube channel is.

1505
01:22:35,490 --> 01:22:38,930
I was like, we need another DPS player.

1506
01:22:39,270 --> 01:22:41,370
And then like literally...

1507
01:22:42,510 --> 01:22:46,090
Literally our other DPS player is forced on support.

1508
01:22:47,610 --> 01:22:49,410
It was actually so cursed.

1509
01:22:50,250 --> 01:22:52,250
It was actually so fucking cursed.

1510
01:22:52,350 --> 01:22:53,270
I got some money.

1511
01:22:53,550 --> 01:22:54,030
Let's go.

1512
01:22:54,950 --> 01:22:56,110
Let's fucking go.

1513
01:23:03,730 --> 01:23:04,470
Okay.

1514
01:23:05,530 --> 01:23:06,150
That's cool.

1515
01:23:07,410 --> 01:23:08,750
That's so cool.

1516
01:23:09,510 --> 01:23:10,230
Like...

1517
01:23:10,230 --> 01:23:11,730
That's so cool.

1518
01:23:14,890 --> 01:23:15,260
Like...

1519
01:23:16,170 --> 01:23:16,910
I...

1520
01:23:18,250 --> 01:23:20,050
They wouldn't even...

1521
01:23:20,050 --> 01:23:23,070
They wouldn't even let Mag DPS up there.

1522
01:23:23,170 --> 01:23:24,150
Oh my...

1523
01:23:24,150 --> 01:23:25,670
I think we need like more heals.

1524
01:23:27,090 --> 01:23:27,830
Like...

1525
01:23:27,830 --> 01:23:30,050
Maybe like a slow instead of the warlock.

1526
01:23:30,050 --> 01:23:31,450
They banned Luna.

1527
01:23:31,830 --> 01:23:32,590
Luna's banned.

1528
01:23:35,600 --> 01:23:38,550
Oh my god.

1529
01:23:41,830 --> 01:23:42,930
Like...

1530
01:23:42,930 --> 01:23:46,630
I think our whole team banned Luna.

1531
01:23:59,370 --> 01:24:12,350
I just go over here.

1532
01:24:12,870 --> 01:24:14,990
I'll just be over here guys.

1533
01:24:16,630 --> 01:24:17,590
We're avoiding people.

1534
01:24:17,790 --> 01:24:18,450
I can't.

1535
01:24:18,510 --> 01:24:19,390
I'm avoiding...

1536
01:24:19,390 --> 01:24:21,110
Now we have too many tanks.

1537
01:24:24,330 --> 01:24:24,790
Alright.

1538
01:24:24,890 --> 01:24:25,670
Here we go.

1539
01:24:26,370 --> 01:24:27,670
Here we go.

1540
01:24:29,050 --> 01:24:29,130
Oh!

1541
01:24:30,150 --> 01:24:30,410
Oh!

1542
01:24:31,430 --> 01:24:35,470
Servers at 224 ping!

1543
01:24:36,790 --> 01:24:37,310
I...

1544
01:24:38,610 --> 01:24:39,130
Alright.

1545
01:24:39,170 --> 01:24:40,170
I can't keep track of it.

1546
01:24:40,650 --> 01:24:41,090
Alright.

1547
01:24:41,170 --> 01:24:43,650
I need my mods to keep track of the naughty list.

1548
01:24:43,650 --> 01:24:44,290
I...

1549
01:24:46,090 --> 01:24:47,290
I actually...

1550
01:24:47,290 --> 01:24:49,090
I... Where am I?

1551
01:24:49,750 --> 01:24:51,030
I'm... I need...

1552
01:24:51,030 --> 01:24:53,890
I need the mods to keep track of the naughty list now.

1553
01:24:54,290 --> 01:24:54,710
I...

1554
01:24:54,710 --> 01:24:56,810
I need them to keep track.

1555
01:24:56,910 --> 01:24:58,210
Cause like I can't see shit.

1556
01:24:58,450 --> 01:24:58,710
Oh!

1557
01:24:58,830 --> 01:25:00,490
Now it stopped lagging!

1558
01:25:00,730 --> 01:25:01,430
That's cool.

1559
01:25:04,870 --> 01:25:05,970
That's cool.

1560
01:25:06,290 --> 01:25:08,310
It literally stopped lagging.

1561
01:25:13,650 --> 01:25:14,390
Hahaha.

1562
01:25:19,150 --> 01:25:22,010
We Q dodge everything.

1563
01:25:29,430 --> 01:25:33,650
He's outside of the fucking map?!

1564
01:25:42,380 --> 01:25:45,180
He's outside...

1565
01:25:45,180 --> 01:25:47,180
I... What?!

1566
01:25:49,340 --> 01:25:50,120
That's right.

1567
01:25:50,580 --> 01:25:52,120
It's the bad list.

1568
01:25:52,720 --> 01:25:54,300
It's the fucking bad list.

1569
01:25:55,780 --> 01:25:56,920
I'm gonna kill this Iron Man.

1570
01:25:57,100 --> 01:25:57,360
Oh!

1571
01:25:57,520 --> 01:25:58,740
Fucking run you little whore.

1572
01:25:59,440 --> 01:26:00,140
That's fucking right.

1573
01:26:02,500 --> 01:26:03,980
I'm gonna report this guy.

1574
01:26:04,380 --> 01:26:05,460
I'm gonna report him.

1575
01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:07,620
I'm gonna fucking report him.

1576
01:26:07,780 --> 01:26:10,180
I hope he knows I'm gonna report him.

1577
01:26:10,460 --> 01:26:11,760
I hope he fucking knows.

1578
01:26:11,760 --> 01:26:13,460
He needs to know.

1579
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:19,020
I'm gonna report him.

1580
01:26:24,620 --> 01:26:27,940
I think Groot walled me into the fucking...

1581
01:26:28,300 --> 01:26:29,680
Symbio did push me in the wall.

1582
01:26:29,680 --> 01:26:30,200
I'm in.

1583
01:26:30,560 --> 01:26:31,020
I'm in.

1584
01:26:38,540 --> 01:26:40,780
Oh my god.

1585
01:26:41,180 --> 01:26:43,020
Oh my god.

1586
01:26:43,440 --> 01:26:44,780
It's five teams.

1587
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:46,840
Oh my god.

1588
01:26:47,020 --> 01:26:48,280
Oh my god.

1589
01:26:49,500 --> 01:26:51,180
Holy fuck.

1590
01:26:58,660 --> 01:27:00,260
No, Mac.

1591
01:27:01,680 --> 01:27:02,600
No, Mac.

1592
01:27:02,600 --> 01:27:04,080
We could have won.

1593
01:27:04,240 --> 01:27:06,360
If you were on anyone.

1594
01:27:07,200 --> 01:27:08,480
But Storm.

1595
01:27:10,340 --> 01:27:12,820
It would have been so free.

1596
01:27:26,890 --> 01:27:27,490
You could...

1597
01:27:27,490 --> 01:27:30,110
You could have killed...

1598
01:27:30,110 --> 01:27:31,210
You

1599
01:27:35,460 --> 01:27:41,370
can't say that when you avoid Storm players.

1600
01:27:50,070 --> 01:27:53,210
He fucking avoids Storm players.

1601
01:27:53,570 --> 01:27:55,010
He fucking says that.

1602
01:27:55,810 --> 01:27:56,370
No, no.

1603
01:27:56,530 --> 01:27:58,790
I avoid Squirrel players.

1604
01:28:03,710 --> 01:28:11,050
I remember in that one game you cried because we had a Storm one trick.

1605
01:28:11,870 --> 01:28:14,930
But we still won because we

1606
01:28:21,150 --> 01:28:23,490
Oh my god.

1607
01:28:27,170 --> 01:28:28,730
I'm like two losses.

1608
01:28:29,090 --> 01:28:30,350
I am two losses away.

1609
01:28:30,350 --> 01:28:30,610
What?

1610
01:28:33,470 --> 01:28:34,590
Oh my god.

1611
01:28:34,670 --> 01:28:36,090
I am two losses away.

1612
01:28:38,350 --> 01:28:39,350
I am...

1613
01:28:39,350 --> 01:28:40,010
Alright.

1614
01:28:40,590 --> 01:28:42,290
I might have to...

1615
01:28:42,290 --> 01:28:45,370
God, I might need reinforcements if I can't...

1616
01:28:45,370 --> 01:28:50,150
I'm tempted to ask an Eternity player and be like, do you wanna play?

1617
01:28:52,350 --> 01:28:53,210
Oh wait.

1618
01:28:53,490 --> 01:28:54,830
I don't know anymore.

1619
01:28:55,070 --> 01:28:56,350
I don't think this Eternity player...

1620
01:28:57,010 --> 01:28:57,570
Oh my god.

1621
01:28:57,570 --> 01:28:58,710
I don't want to make him lose.

1622
01:29:08,030 --> 01:29:09,370
Oh my god.

1623
01:29:09,870 --> 01:29:10,350
Nevermind.

1624
01:29:10,430 --> 01:29:12,450
He's not having a good day too, guys.

1625
01:29:12,690 --> 01:29:13,410
He's not.

1626
01:29:13,550 --> 01:29:15,690
He's not having a good day as well.

1627
01:29:19,210 --> 01:29:21,730
He's not having a good day as well, guys.

1628
01:29:21,830 --> 01:29:25,430
So I might not be a great time for him as well.

1629
01:29:25,430 --> 01:29:27,170
I might not be as...

1630
01:29:27,170 --> 01:29:28,770
Nah, Surefour doesn't want to duo.

1631
01:29:28,910 --> 01:29:29,810
He wants to solo.

1632
01:29:31,090 --> 01:29:32,570
He's been on a solo grind.

1633
01:29:36,090 --> 01:29:39,150
I think it's like he wants to solo for the Eternity and stuff.

1634
01:29:39,950 --> 01:29:40,710
Guys, I...

1635
01:29:41,350 --> 01:29:42,790
This is not...

1636
01:29:42,790 --> 01:29:46,730
No, Jirard, my dragons have cursed all my...

1637
01:29:46,730 --> 01:29:49,510
Streaming my arrivals was a mistake.

1638
01:29:49,910 --> 01:29:52,250
I should've just delayed the stream until I got it.

1639
01:29:52,350 --> 01:29:53,010
I should've...

1640
01:29:53,010 --> 01:29:54,990
I should've...

1641
01:29:54,990 --> 01:29:59,490
I should've just delayed the stream until I fucking got it.

1642
01:30:00,050 --> 01:30:02,510
Streaming my arrivals was a mistake.

1643
01:30:02,710 --> 01:30:04,930
I shouldn't have streamed my arrival.

1644
01:30:05,550 --> 01:30:10,370
I sincerely apologize for my dumbass and big penance.

1645
01:30:10,570 --> 01:30:13,250
Are you the Penny?!

1646
01:30:13,250 --> 01:30:14,070
That reminded me.

1647
01:30:14,130 --> 01:30:14,910
I forgot to report.

1648
01:30:15,690 --> 01:30:17,050
I forgot to report.

1649
01:30:19,430 --> 01:30:20,330
Thank you.

1650
01:30:20,530 --> 01:30:21,830
Thank you for the awkward superchat.

1651
01:30:22,270 --> 01:30:22,410
Thank you.

1652
01:30:22,410 --> 01:30:23,270
Thank you.

1653
01:30:24,110 --> 01:30:26,410
Was that you?!

1654
01:30:27,610 --> 01:30:28,610
What's it about?

1655
01:30:31,490 --> 01:30:32,610
Oh my god.

1656
01:30:32,730 --> 01:30:33,590
Self reported.

1657
01:30:34,230 --> 01:30:35,970
Dude, too late.

1658
01:30:37,830 --> 01:30:39,770
I'm holding God of War hostage.

1659
01:30:40,130 --> 01:30:41,230
That's fucking right.

1660
01:30:42,410 --> 01:30:43,050
That's...

1661
01:30:43,050 --> 01:30:44,850
That's fucking right.

1662
01:30:44,970 --> 01:30:49,910
I will fucking hold God of War hostage until I get this over with.

1663
01:30:51,170 --> 01:30:51,710
Until...

1664
01:30:51,710 --> 01:30:53,590
It's too... How long have I been playing?

1665
01:30:53,870 --> 01:30:55,770
I've been playing for an hour and a ha...

1666
01:30:55,770 --> 01:30:56,850
Oh my god.

1667
01:30:57,590 --> 01:30:58,070
Oh my god!

1668
01:31:04,410 --> 01:31:07,750
He is a pro player in Apex.

1669
01:31:08,270 --> 01:31:09,450
He is a pro player.

1670
01:31:15,530 --> 01:31:17,490
Oh my god, who said that?

1671
01:31:17,490 --> 01:31:19,310
Oh my god, you said that.

1672
01:31:19,370 --> 01:31:20,410
Oh my god.

1673
01:31:21,310 --> 01:31:22,090
Thanks, man.

1674
01:31:22,150 --> 01:31:23,620
I'm on a lost streak, though.

1675
01:31:28,850 --> 01:31:30,270
I shouldn't say that.

1676
01:31:37,370 --> 01:31:38,610
I shouldn't say that.

1677
01:31:38,990 --> 01:31:41,890
He's like, oh my god, Dirk is the best support player in Oregon.

1678
01:31:42,050 --> 01:31:43,230
I was like, oh, that's sweet.

1679
01:31:43,650 --> 01:31:44,730
That's so sweet of him.

1680
01:31:44,850 --> 01:31:46,470
I'm on a lost streak, though.

1681
01:31:46,470 --> 01:31:47,510
I'm on a...

1682
01:31:51,210 --> 01:31:53,230
I didn't say it!

1683
01:31:53,690 --> 01:31:54,990
I didn't say it.

1684
01:31:57,450 --> 01:31:58,370
Please,

1685
01:32:03,870 --> 01:32:04,790
please play.

1686
01:32:05,170 --> 01:32:06,430
Oh, yeah.

1687
01:32:07,790 --> 01:32:08,710
Yeah.

1688
01:32:09,070 --> 01:32:12,070
Yeah, should have fucking lost me that game.

1689
01:32:12,630 --> 01:32:15,270
Now we're fucking here until we get it back.

1690
01:32:16,030 --> 01:32:18,010
Should have fucking lost that game.

1691
01:32:20,230 --> 01:32:21,590
This is punishment.

1692
01:32:25,070 --> 01:32:26,750
Alright, focus up.

1693
01:32:33,250 --> 01:32:33,850
Okay.

1694
01:32:37,650 --> 01:32:38,610
There we go.

1695
01:32:38,810 --> 01:32:39,370
He dead.

1696
01:32:40,870 --> 01:32:41,950
He fucking dead.

1697
01:32:42,350 --> 01:32:43,330
I'm fucking getting closer.

1698
01:32:43,670 --> 01:32:45,570
I'm fucking getting in on the sauce.

1699
01:32:46,590 --> 01:32:48,350
I'm getting in on the sauce.

1700
01:32:48,670 --> 01:32:49,770
That's fucking right.

1701
01:32:49,890 --> 01:32:51,130
I'm fucking getting in.

1702
01:32:51,750 --> 01:32:53,010
I'm getting fucking in.

1703
01:32:53,150 --> 01:32:55,550
I'm fucking I'm fucking... Oh, shit!

1704
01:32:55,670 --> 01:32:57,010
I'm not getting in anymore!

1705
01:32:59,850 --> 01:33:01,070
Oh my god.

1706
01:33:04,030 --> 01:33:06,010
I'm not getting back in anymore.

1707
01:33:06,190 --> 01:33:08,030
That shit was scary, not gonna lie.

1708
01:33:11,510 --> 01:33:13,330
Wait, did I just saw something to my right?

1709
01:33:13,550 --> 01:33:13,730
No.

1710
01:33:16,210 --> 01:33:17,250
Oh my god.

1711
01:33:18,010 --> 01:33:18,970
Oh no.

1712
01:33:25,540 --> 01:33:26,020
Oh,

1713
01:33:31,620 --> 01:33:33,280
we gotta get on point, guys.

1714
01:33:38,880 --> 01:33:40,140
No, we're not cooked!

1715
01:33:40,220 --> 01:33:41,140
We're not cooked!

1716
01:33:41,140 --> 01:33:42,040
We're not cooked!

1717
01:33:43,440 --> 01:33:44,600
Oh, nevermind.

1718
01:33:44,900 --> 01:33:45,340
We're cooked.

1719
01:33:45,520 --> 01:33:46,360
We're a little cooked.

1720
01:33:47,400 --> 01:33:48,380
We're a little cooked.

1721
01:33:49,460 --> 01:33:52,420
Guys, do you think money is gonna stop me from playing Marvel Rivals?

1722
01:33:54,000 --> 01:34:01,060
You guys have to learn that no amount of money will save you from this fucking hostage situation.

1723
01:34:01,780 --> 01:34:04,140
All I care about are rank points.

1724
01:34:04,700 --> 01:34:07,900
You think money is gonna fix it?

1725
01:34:08,560 --> 01:34:09,200
Hahaha.

1726
01:34:10,360 --> 01:34:12,520
It's all about the rank points.

1727
01:34:14,340 --> 01:34:15,600
Okay, guys, guys.

1728
01:34:17,200 --> 01:34:19,200
Oh, they blocked it, I see.

1729
01:34:22,140 --> 01:34:23,800
Okay, yeah, I'm backing up.

1730
01:34:24,420 --> 01:34:25,400
Oh, shit!

1731
01:34:28,200 --> 01:34:28,960
He's so dead.

1732
01:34:29,880 --> 01:34:30,700
There's no way.

1733
01:34:31,220 --> 01:34:32,080
He's so dead.

1734
01:34:33,540 --> 01:34:34,720
He's so dead.

1735
01:34:38,400 --> 01:34:40,100
I'm so dead, too.

1736
01:34:40,360 --> 01:34:40,960
I'm not!

1737
01:34:48,060 --> 01:34:50,680
Giga, thank you for the akka-akka-supa.

1738
01:34:51,100 --> 01:34:51,300
Thank you.

1739
01:34:51,660 --> 01:34:55,320
Alright, here we go.

1740
01:34:57,920 --> 01:34:58,440
Alright.

1741
01:35:03,450 --> 01:35:05,830
Don't worry, we will we will get it.

1742
01:35:05,910 --> 01:35:07,210
Guys, I swear.

1743
01:35:08,610 --> 01:35:09,730
My god.

1744
01:35:10,770 --> 01:35:11,330
Okay.

1745
01:35:12,630 --> 01:35:15,350
I literally, oh my god.

1746
01:35:15,710 --> 01:35:16,710
Wait, it's still possible.

1747
01:35:16,850 --> 01:35:17,810
We can contest this.

1748
01:35:18,890 --> 01:35:20,150
We can get here.

1749
01:35:21,190 --> 01:35:22,070
Okay, nope.

1750
01:35:22,110 --> 01:35:22,910
We gotta go this way.

1751
01:35:24,070 --> 01:35:26,110
This is how Limbo's gonna look like.

1752
01:35:28,590 --> 01:35:30,010
Streaming this was a mistake.

1753
01:35:30,570 --> 01:35:31,870
But it's too late.

1754
01:35:31,870 --> 01:35:33,350
I'm committed now.

1755
01:35:33,550 --> 01:35:34,870
How long will this stream be?

1756
01:35:35,490 --> 01:35:36,770
Let's find out.

1757
01:35:37,550 --> 01:35:39,350
I'm fully committed now.

1758
01:35:43,550 --> 01:35:47,670
We'll see how long this stream is gonna be, guys.

1759
01:35:48,330 --> 01:35:50,030
We're gonna see.

1760
01:35:52,790 --> 01:35:55,250
How long will this stream be?

1761
01:35:58,170 --> 01:35:59,050
Woah.

1762
01:36:05,390 --> 01:36:06,270
Oh,

1763
01:36:09,450 --> 01:36:09,750
guys.

1764
01:36:10,050 --> 01:36:12,550
I think I think he's dead.

1765
01:36:12,830 --> 01:36:16,510
Yeah, I fucking put all my heals on it.

1766
01:36:19,050 --> 01:36:19,490
Yeah.

1767
01:36:25,250 --> 01:36:26,390
He's gonna be playing Limbo.

1768
01:36:28,930 --> 01:36:29,530
Oh,

1769
01:36:32,830 --> 01:36:32,950
shit.

1770
01:36:33,030 --> 01:36:33,530
Let's go.

1771
01:36:35,090 --> 01:36:36,410
Let's fucking go.

1772
01:36:40,820 --> 01:36:42,200
Let's fucking go.

1773
01:36:46,570 --> 01:36:47,150
Oh, shit.

1774
01:36:47,150 --> 01:36:47,630
I should heal.

1775
01:36:50,310 --> 01:36:53,410
No, does he not know I'm right here?

1776
01:36:53,790 --> 01:36:57,330
Cause I was too busy DPSing and missing my shots.

1777
01:37:00,610 --> 01:37:01,050
Alright.

1778
01:37:01,190 --> 01:37:03,470
I have no idea where I'm shooting at right now.

1779
01:37:03,650 --> 01:37:04,950
I can't see shit.

1780
01:37:06,090 --> 01:37:07,830
Legitimately, I can't see anything.

1781
01:37:10,450 --> 01:37:11,350
Alright, here we go.

1782
01:37:14,870 --> 01:37:17,230
I'm not gonna have a chat anymore with all these bans.

1783
01:37:26,310 --> 01:37:28,410
I'm not gonna have a chat no more.

1784
01:37:31,470 --> 01:37:32,450
We are invincible!

1785
01:37:39,040 --> 01:37:44,580
They have eyes looking for it.

1786
01:37:45,400 --> 01:37:48,280
He's 100% looking for it.

1787
01:37:53,060 --> 01:37:55,120
Where am I?

1788
01:37:55,460 --> 01:37:57,740
He taxied me to the other side!

1789
01:37:58,540 --> 01:37:59,700
That was so close.

1790
01:38:02,920 --> 01:38:03,600
Alright.

1791
01:38:03,900 --> 01:38:04,680
Here we go.

1792
01:38:12,440 --> 01:38:13,440
I can!

1793
01:38:13,740 --> 01:38:14,560
Let's go!

1794
01:38:14,860 --> 01:38:15,520
I touched.

1795
01:38:24,960 --> 01:38:25,640
I

1796
01:38:36,320 --> 01:38:37,000
could!

1797
01:38:37,260 --> 01:38:38,140
I saw it!

1798
01:38:38,820 --> 01:38:40,000
I stayed on it!

1799
01:38:46,060 --> 01:38:46,080
Alright.

1800
01:38:50,680 --> 01:38:51,400
Six games.

1801
01:38:52,440 --> 01:38:53,040
You know what?

1802
01:38:53,180 --> 01:38:56,780
Drop the fucking Trinity player in here and be like, hey, you wanna join in?

1803
01:39:06,670 --> 01:39:08,250
Are you fucking dumb, bro?

1804
01:39:08,430 --> 01:39:09,370
Did you even just hear what I said?

1805
01:39:12,250 --> 01:39:17,770
If I hit a three man whale and I can kill three of them why is my group putting walls in front of me

1806
01:39:23,910 --> 01:39:24,510
You're right.

1807
01:39:24,570 --> 01:39:26,610
He's supposed to read your mind on when you're gonna ult.

1808
01:39:37,090 --> 01:39:38,490
Oh my god.

1809
01:39:38,650 --> 01:39:40,650
It's not looking so great.

1810
01:39:40,830 --> 01:39:42,130
Oh my god.

1811
01:39:42,130 --> 01:39:44,610
It's not looking so great.

1812
01:39:44,890 --> 01:39:45,250
Guys.

1813
01:39:49,770 --> 01:39:56,250
I'm gonna drag the one above all one above all into this shit show.

1814
01:39:56,550 --> 01:40:00,470
I'm gonna make him lose g. I'm gonna make him lose one above all.

1815
01:40:02,310 --> 01:40:03,950
I'm gonna lose it all.

1816
01:40:04,550 --> 01:40:06,910
I'm gonna make sure people lose it all with me.

1817
01:40:06,910 --> 01:40:07,710
Oh my god.

1818
01:40:09,630 --> 01:40:12,110
No, I didn't turn it off.

1819
01:40:12,190 --> 01:40:13,750
I wanna make sure it was so loud.

1820
01:40:13,930 --> 01:40:16,110
I wanna make sure everybody could hear what they're saying.

1821
01:40:17,170 --> 01:40:22,590
If you fall that's so messed up.

1822
01:40:25,610 --> 01:40:26,210
Alright.

1823
01:40:27,350 --> 01:40:29,010
I got this.

1824
01:40:36,840 --> 01:40:37,620
He is rude.

1825
01:40:39,220 --> 01:40:40,420
He is rude.

1826
01:40:42,620 --> 01:40:43,980
He is rude.

1827
01:40:44,760 --> 01:40:45,780
He is.

1828
01:40:46,340 --> 01:40:47,540
He is rude.

1829
01:40:48,120 --> 01:40:49,340
He is rude.

1830
01:40:50,020 --> 01:40:50,920
He is.

1831
01:40:51,060 --> 01:40:52,160
He's still rude.

1832
01:40:58,060 --> 01:40:59,920
He is rude.

1833
01:41:02,880 --> 01:41:03,980
He's rude.

1834
01:41:07,370 --> 01:41:09,770
I'm shaping my little hidey hole.

1835
01:41:10,470 --> 01:41:11,230
Wow.

1836
01:41:11,730 --> 01:41:14,050
Look at my little hidey hole that I have.

1837
01:41:14,570 --> 01:41:15,310
Right here.

1838
01:41:15,310 --> 01:41:15,490
Yeah.

1839
01:41:16,370 --> 01:41:17,290
I am rude.

1840
01:41:17,950 --> 01:41:18,670
Look at that.

1841
01:41:21,550 --> 01:41:25,270
Look at that little hidey hole that I have.

1842
01:41:25,590 --> 01:41:27,330
Oh, what's the current win-loss ratio?

1843
01:41:27,670 --> 01:41:31,590
I was winning so much before the stream started.

1844
01:41:31,790 --> 01:41:32,870
Isn't that fucking crazy?

1845
01:41:36,990 --> 01:41:37,970
And then...

1846
01:41:37,970 --> 01:41:39,250
And then...

1847
01:41:39,250 --> 01:41:42,590
Some fucking curse hit me.

1848
01:41:42,590 --> 01:41:44,290
And I was like...

1849
01:41:44,290 --> 01:41:46,290
That was the worst that could happen.

1850
01:41:47,250 --> 01:41:47,910
Um...

1851
01:41:47,910 --> 01:41:49,790
A lot, apparently.

1852
01:41:50,230 --> 01:41:51,530
A lot could happen.

1853
01:41:51,710 --> 01:41:56,740
A lot could happen.

1854
01:41:57,120 --> 01:41:58,300
Isn't that crazy?

1855
01:41:59,660 --> 01:42:01,240
A lot happened.

1856
01:42:02,080 --> 01:42:02,920
A lot.

1857
01:42:05,020 --> 01:42:06,760
Oh my god, Grutab.

1858
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:08,660
Grutab.

1859
01:42:09,080 --> 01:42:11,140
This was a lot of ults, but that's okay.

1860
01:42:11,140 --> 01:42:11,660
Like...

1861
01:42:11,660 --> 01:42:13,680
Fuck all of these guys, I guess.

1862
01:42:13,760 --> 01:42:15,600
Oh my god!

1863
01:42:15,900 --> 01:42:18,100
Let's just use everything, guys!

1864
01:42:19,040 --> 01:42:19,820
Let's go!

1865
01:42:22,940 --> 01:42:23,280
Alright.

1866
01:42:24,910 --> 01:42:25,740
This is fine.

1867
01:42:26,520 --> 01:42:27,580
I'm so focused.

1868
01:42:30,860 --> 01:42:31,220
Alright.

1869
01:42:31,880 --> 01:42:33,360
I'm so focused.

1870
01:42:34,760 --> 01:42:35,140
I'm...

1871
01:42:36,830 --> 01:42:37,940
I'm focused.

1872
01:42:37,940 --> 01:42:39,180
I don't know about others.

1873
01:42:39,400 --> 01:42:41,520
But I'm so focused.

1874
01:42:43,140 --> 01:42:44,500
Oh my god.

1875
01:42:46,300 --> 01:42:47,940
I'm so focused.

1876
01:42:52,200 --> 01:42:53,060
Okay.

1877
01:42:55,950 --> 01:42:57,020
Alright, let's go.

1878
01:42:58,280 --> 01:42:59,600
Let's fucking go!

1879
01:42:59,740 --> 01:43:00,520
Just fucking...

1880
01:43:00,520 --> 01:43:02,000
There we go.

1881
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:02,100
Damn.

1882
01:43:07,820 --> 01:43:09,100
Alright, nice.

1883
01:43:10,280 --> 01:43:10,860
Let's go.

1884
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:12,700
There we go.

1885
01:43:13,860 --> 01:43:17,220
And then I'll give you my little damage boost while I stand here.

1886
01:43:18,380 --> 01:43:19,480
And then...

1887
01:43:19,980 --> 01:43:22,320
And then I'll give you more damage boost.

1888
01:43:22,520 --> 01:43:25,400
And then I'll give you the little heal while we stand here.

1889
01:43:25,860 --> 01:43:27,000
And then...

1890
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:29,900
I'll give you more, and then I'll give you this.

1891
01:43:29,900 --> 01:43:31,880
And then I'll give you this.

1892
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:33,460
And then I'll give you this.

1893
01:43:33,780 --> 01:43:35,260
And then we go in.

1894
01:43:35,560 --> 01:43:37,780
We fucking go the fuck in.

1895
01:43:38,080 --> 01:43:39,880
We go in.

1896
01:43:41,260 --> 01:43:43,020
We go in.

1897
01:43:44,740 --> 01:43:46,000
And then we go back.

1898
01:43:46,100 --> 01:43:46,940
And then we back out.

1899
01:43:47,240 --> 01:43:48,760
Okay, alright.

1900
01:43:49,260 --> 01:43:49,940
That's fine.

1901
01:43:50,040 --> 01:43:52,740
They popped three ults for one of my...

1902
01:43:53,580 --> 01:43:57,420
Guys, they literally popped three ults for one of mine.

1903
01:43:57,420 --> 01:43:58,960
So like...

1904
01:43:58,960 --> 01:43:59,780
That's fine.

1905
01:44:00,600 --> 01:44:03,600
I think that's like the best trade I could get.

1906
01:44:03,920 --> 01:44:04,840
Not gonna lie.

1907
01:44:07,540 --> 01:44:09,120
That's such a good trade.

1908
01:44:11,320 --> 01:44:12,020
C'mon.

1909
01:44:12,340 --> 01:44:12,960
C'mon.

1910
01:44:13,840 --> 01:44:14,540
C'mon.

1911
01:44:17,520 --> 01:44:18,740
Alright, there you go.

1912
01:44:18,980 --> 01:44:20,020
C'mon, shoot him.

1913
01:44:23,580 --> 01:44:24,280
Um...

1914
01:44:24,280 --> 01:44:24,940
What?

1915
01:44:25,400 --> 01:44:26,820
It was... Oh!

1916
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:29,880
This is where I die.

1917
01:44:31,940 --> 01:44:33,860
Why couldn't Mindstrange do that?

1918
01:44:34,660 --> 01:44:34,980
What?

1919
01:44:35,900 --> 01:44:39,220
Why couldn't Mindstrange do something as cool as that?

1920
01:44:41,800 --> 01:44:42,720
That's crazy.

1921
01:44:43,160 --> 01:44:44,280
That was so cool.

1922
01:44:45,200 --> 01:44:48,420
It would be so cool if it happens to like our team.

1923
01:44:51,920 --> 01:44:53,700
Am I getting shot by something?

1924
01:44:56,540 --> 01:44:57,140
Okay.

1925
01:44:58,680 --> 01:45:00,280
That's fucking right, bitch.

1926
01:45:00,480 --> 01:45:00,940
Get out.

1927
01:45:01,800 --> 01:45:02,600
That's fucking right.

1928
01:45:02,680 --> 01:45:04,780
I'm also trying to farm my ult too.

1929
01:45:06,200 --> 01:45:07,940
Alright, you guys...

1930
01:45:09,660 --> 01:45:10,260
Alright.

1931
01:45:10,260 --> 01:45:11,320
Alright, I...

1932
01:45:11,320 --> 01:45:12,420
I leave here.

1933
01:45:15,760 --> 01:45:17,120
Everything is fine.

1934
01:45:20,340 --> 01:45:21,520
That's right, Groot!

1935
01:45:22,500 --> 01:45:23,220
C'mon.

1936
01:45:23,220 --> 01:45:24,160
That's right!

1937
01:45:26,620 --> 01:45:29,340
Alright, I guess I'll push the cart myself.

1938
01:45:29,940 --> 01:45:30,580
Right, guys?

1939
01:45:32,540 --> 01:45:33,260
Right?

1940
01:45:35,780 --> 01:45:37,060
Alright, let's go!

1941
01:45:38,080 --> 01:45:39,380
He has eyes!

1942
01:45:42,520 --> 01:45:43,920
Is he... Is he...

1943
01:45:43,920 --> 01:45:45,260
Oh, he is not.

1944
01:45:46,580 --> 01:45:47,300
Okay.

1945
01:45:47,820 --> 01:45:49,340
I'm a little worried now.

1946
01:45:52,160 --> 01:45:54,080
I'm... I'm a little worried here.

1947
01:45:58,500 --> 01:45:59,600
I don't think...

1948
01:45:59,600 --> 01:46:00,900
Guys, I don't think we're gonna live.

1949
01:46:01,080 --> 01:46:01,720
I don't...

1950
01:46:01,720 --> 01:46:03,680
I don't think... Oh wait, I live.

1951
01:46:03,820 --> 01:46:04,460
Let's go.

1952
01:46:06,800 --> 01:46:08,560
Oh, I don't think they're gonna live though.

1953
01:46:10,020 --> 01:46:11,640
Yeah, they're definitely not gonna live.

1954
01:46:11,700 --> 01:46:13,220
Oh my god, what's slowing me down?

1955
01:46:15,740 --> 01:46:17,340
Okay, but they won't know I'm right here.

1956
01:46:19,540 --> 01:46:20,900
I have to go back downstairs.

1957
01:46:24,960 --> 01:46:25,900
That's fine.

1958
01:46:27,120 --> 01:46:28,780
Okay, that's not fine.

1959
01:46:30,080 --> 01:46:31,220
That's not fine.

1960
01:46:31,240 --> 01:46:32,940
Oh my god!

1961
01:46:32,960 --> 01:46:33,500
What?

1962
01:46:33,700 --> 01:46:33,960
Why?

1963
01:46:34,120 --> 01:46:34,500
Why?

1964
01:46:35,080 --> 01:46:35,440
Why?

1965
01:46:36,340 --> 01:46:37,600
Holy shit!

1966
01:46:38,180 --> 01:46:41,300
They just ran into that turret just like that!

1967
01:46:43,680 --> 01:46:44,600
Here we go.

1968
01:46:45,380 --> 01:46:46,540
Goodbye, rocket.

1969
01:46:47,560 --> 01:46:48,740
I hope you live.

1970
01:46:51,440 --> 01:46:53,100
Alright, here we go.

1971
01:46:54,360 --> 01:46:55,340
You go do your damage.

1972
01:46:55,500 --> 01:46:55,920
Me too.

1973
01:46:58,180 --> 01:46:59,520
Oh, they have Moon Knight.

1974
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:01,320
I can see it.

1975
01:47:03,080 --> 01:47:04,220
I see it.

1976
01:47:04,860 --> 01:47:05,720
They have Moon Knight.

1977
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:09,540
Alright.

1978
01:47:10,920 --> 01:47:11,760
It's fine.

1979
01:47:12,540 --> 01:47:13,820
It's not fine, guys.

1980
01:47:13,900 --> 01:47:16,960
I think we all realize how not fine this is right now.

1981
01:47:16,960 --> 01:47:17,300
Like...

1982
01:47:21,440 --> 01:47:23,060
I think...

1983
01:47:23,060 --> 01:47:24,960
I think we all realize...

1984
01:47:27,740 --> 01:47:29,760
Oh my god!

1985
01:47:29,760 --> 01:47:32,620
I'm just trying to make sure...

1986
01:47:34,840 --> 01:47:35,720
Oh my god!

1987
01:47:36,700 --> 01:47:37,960
Oh my god!

1988
01:47:39,480 --> 01:47:39,900
Oh!

1989
01:47:40,800 --> 01:47:43,100
I'm trying to make sure you're all...

1990
01:47:43,680 --> 01:47:45,140
I can't!

1991
01:47:45,140 --> 01:47:47,360
I ran out of lead!

1992
01:47:53,410 --> 01:47:55,770
I ran out of fucking lead!

1993
01:47:59,170 --> 01:47:59,870
Guys, no.

1994
01:48:00,090 --> 01:48:02,010
Reyna will be fine.

1995
01:48:03,270 --> 01:48:05,730
I don't think we can get a portal in time.

1996
01:48:05,890 --> 01:48:06,410
There's no way.

1997
01:48:07,130 --> 01:48:08,250
But I'll touch it here.

1998
01:48:17,270 --> 01:48:18,410
What the fuck?

1999
01:48:19,110 --> 01:48:19,510
Wait.

2000
01:48:20,290 --> 01:48:21,190
Wait, what?

2001
01:48:22,290 --> 01:48:23,230
Wait, what?

2002
01:48:24,490 --> 01:48:25,970
Wait a minute, what?

2003
01:48:28,170 --> 01:48:28,510
Ouch!

2004
01:48:32,070 --> 01:48:33,470
Guys, we still have to defend.

2005
01:48:33,730 --> 01:48:35,270
We still have to defend!

2006
01:48:35,910 --> 01:48:36,130
What?

2007
01:48:42,650 --> 01:48:43,690
That worked?

2008
01:48:47,070 --> 01:48:49,490
That actually worked?

2009
01:48:53,870 --> 01:48:54,970
Oh my god!

2010
01:48:55,650 --> 01:48:58,090
I don't know if we can defend it, but like...

2011
01:49:02,290 --> 01:49:05,190
I don't know if we can defend it, but wow!

2012
01:49:09,150 --> 01:49:09,830
Alright.

2013
01:49:11,970 --> 01:49:12,630
Here we go.

2014
01:49:14,850 --> 01:49:15,930
Here we go.

2015
01:49:16,870 --> 01:49:17,850
This is fine.

2016
01:49:18,790 --> 01:49:20,090
We're gonna see Ragnarok.

2017
01:49:20,630 --> 01:49:24,090
We're gonna see dad back, guys.

2018
01:49:24,790 --> 01:49:27,530
We're gonna see dad, guys.

2019
01:49:30,430 --> 01:49:35,990
Oh, thank you, Leon, for extending your luck to me.

2020
01:49:37,950 --> 01:49:38,990
Thank you, Leon.

2021
01:49:39,130 --> 01:49:40,010
It's been two hours.

2022
01:49:40,110 --> 01:49:42,350
I've been playing Marble Rivals for two hours now.

2023
01:49:43,190 --> 01:49:45,110
It doesn't even feel like two hours.

2024
01:49:45,570 --> 01:49:49,690
I feel like I didn't even realize it's two hours past.

2025
01:49:49,910 --> 01:49:53,330
It feels like one hour of Marble Rivals.

2026
01:49:53,330 --> 01:49:53,570
Marble Rivals.

2027
01:49:58,990 --> 01:50:01,570
Let's just stand here in the center.

2028
01:50:02,350 --> 01:50:04,630
Let's just stand here.

2029
01:50:07,410 --> 01:50:08,930
What the...

2030
01:50:08,930 --> 01:50:09,650
Where am I?

2031
01:50:15,010 --> 01:50:16,530
Oh, guys!

2032
01:50:16,870 --> 01:50:18,410
That ain't it!

2033
01:50:27,960 --> 01:50:28,860
No!

2034
01:50:29,120 --> 01:50:30,540
I almost got it!

2035
01:50:30,760 --> 01:50:35,300
Guys, that was definitely not it.

2036
01:50:35,620 --> 01:50:38,700
That was not it.

2037
01:50:39,500 --> 01:50:41,000
What was that TP?

2038
01:50:42,460 --> 01:50:44,100
What was that TP?

2039
01:50:47,920 --> 01:50:49,380
What the fuck?

2040
01:50:50,460 --> 01:50:52,320
Can we touch it?

2041
01:50:52,320 --> 01:50:53,200
No!

2042
01:50:59,420 --> 01:51:01,800
Oh my god!

2043
01:51:06,860 --> 01:51:08,140
Oh my god!

2044
01:51:09,520 --> 01:51:10,760
Oh my god!

2045
01:51:12,840 --> 01:51:14,400
What happened?

2046
01:51:16,060 --> 01:51:17,520
What happened?

2047
01:51:20,120 --> 01:51:22,460
What's going on?

2048
01:51:25,670 --> 01:51:27,610
Oh no, they're gonna push up after that.

2049
01:51:28,570 --> 01:51:30,090
They're gonna push up here.

2050
01:51:30,230 --> 01:51:32,590
I don't know what the fuck happened though.

2051
01:51:33,410 --> 01:51:35,190
Legitimately, I don't know what happened.

2052
01:51:38,410 --> 01:51:40,770
I don't know what happened here.

2053
01:51:50,620 --> 01:51:52,240
Oh my god.

2054
01:51:54,060 --> 01:51:55,300
What's going on?

2055
01:51:57,640 --> 01:51:59,000
What's going on?

2056
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:00,500
Oh my god!

2057
01:52:00,560 --> 01:52:02,000
What the fuck?

2058
01:52:02,120 --> 01:52:03,340
Where did you come from?

2059
01:52:05,680 --> 01:52:08,320
What's going on?

2060
01:52:11,180 --> 01:52:12,500
No escape.

2061
01:52:12,820 --> 01:52:14,220
No survivors.

2062
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:17,400
Oh my god.

2063
01:52:17,720 --> 01:52:19,680
What the fuck was going on?

2064
01:52:23,760 --> 01:52:25,100
Oh my god.

2065
01:52:25,620 --> 01:52:27,640
Can't be that close.

2066
01:52:28,800 --> 01:52:29,340
It's okay.

2067
01:52:30,280 --> 01:52:31,920
Things will be okay, guys.

2068
01:52:32,420 --> 01:52:33,280
I'm 35.

2069
01:52:33,640 --> 01:52:34,520
Oh my god.

2070
01:52:34,560 --> 01:52:35,620
He has 56.

2071
01:52:36,120 --> 01:52:37,840
How does he have 56?

2072
01:52:38,380 --> 01:52:41,740
I can't wait to drag... I hope that other guy, that's one above all.

2073
01:52:42,040 --> 01:52:43,760
I can't wait to drag him down with me.

2074
01:52:44,360 --> 01:52:46,160
I'm gonna... I can't wait.

2075
01:52:54,360 --> 01:52:55,280
I did it.

2076
01:52:55,360 --> 01:52:56,700
We're gonna go to God of War.

2077
01:52:56,900 --> 01:52:59,880
The moment we get back GM... Guys, I swear.

2078
01:53:01,680 --> 01:53:03,580
Guys, I swear to god.

2079
01:53:03,720 --> 01:53:08,120
The moment we get back GM 1, we'll be back to God of War, guys.

2080
01:53:08,240 --> 01:53:08,940
I swear.

2081
01:53:09,840 --> 01:53:11,120
Please believe in me.

2082
01:53:11,300 --> 01:53:12,000
Also, I need to...

2083
01:53:17,540 --> 01:53:18,740
I swear.

2084
01:53:19,900 --> 01:53:21,560
I swear, everybody.

2085
01:53:22,480 --> 01:53:23,680
I swear.

2086
01:53:24,140 --> 01:53:26,680
We will play God of War today.

2087
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:28,260
It will happen.

2088
01:53:28,380 --> 01:53:30,700
It will happen.

2089
01:53:33,300 --> 01:53:33,860
No.

2090
01:53:34,580 --> 01:53:38,320
No, we don't need to change the stream title, guys.

2091
01:53:38,640 --> 01:53:39,340
We don't.

2092
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:41,640
It'll be fine.

2093
01:53:42,240 --> 01:53:42,740
It'll be fine.

2094
01:53:42,980 --> 01:53:45,160
I'm playing the game of my fucking life right now.

2095
01:53:48,220 --> 01:53:48,780
Alright, here we go.

2096
01:53:49,940 --> 01:53:50,580
Here we go.

2097
01:53:50,580 --> 01:53:51,440
Here we go.

2098
01:53:52,580 --> 01:53:54,020
This is fine.

2099
01:53:54,180 --> 01:53:56,480
Going down main, okay.

2100
01:54:00,440 --> 01:54:01,600
That's smart, though.

2101
01:54:02,140 --> 01:54:05,060
Honestly, that's really smart of them.

2102
01:54:07,220 --> 01:54:08,460
I would.

2103
01:54:10,300 --> 01:54:11,100
Wait, what?

2104
01:54:17,330 --> 01:54:18,790
Oh my god.

2105
01:54:25,630 --> 01:54:26,090
Okay.

2106
01:54:26,090 --> 01:54:26,170
Okay.

2107
01:54:30,790 --> 01:54:32,890
Trying to farm leaves right now.

2108
01:54:33,290 --> 01:54:33,510
No.

2109
01:54:42,730 --> 01:54:43,510
Inspire.

2110
01:54:58,900 --> 01:54:59,700
Bitch!

2111
01:55:08,700 --> 01:55:09,300
Bitch!

2112
01:55:12,600 --> 01:55:14,060
Get over here.

2113
01:55:17,960 --> 01:55:18,560
Bitch!

2114
01:55:26,050 --> 01:55:26,830
I'm a little scared.

2115
01:55:26,950 --> 01:55:27,810
I don't have cover anymore.

2116
01:55:27,810 --> 01:55:28,490
Okay, team, it's alright.

2117
01:55:31,090 --> 01:55:31,870
Where's the portal?

2118
01:55:38,080 --> 01:55:39,000
Where's the...

2119
01:55:39,660 --> 01:55:40,440
I don't see it.

2120
01:55:42,320 --> 01:55:43,320
I'm just herding it.

2121
01:55:43,440 --> 01:55:43,860
I'm just herding it.

2122
01:55:46,440 --> 01:55:47,240
Wait, that's huge!

2123
01:55:47,640 --> 01:55:48,420
That's huge!

2124
01:55:50,460 --> 01:55:51,300
That's huge!

2125
01:55:53,660 --> 01:55:54,380
That's huge!

2126
01:55:54,520 --> 01:55:55,340
That's my keyring!

2127
01:55:56,240 --> 01:55:57,160
That's really...

2128
01:56:02,220 --> 01:56:04,140
That's where I fucking run.

2129
01:56:04,690 --> 01:56:05,660
Fucking run.

2130
01:56:08,300 --> 01:56:10,880
Three, two, one.

2131
01:56:11,900 --> 01:56:12,260
Yes!

2132
01:56:14,660 --> 01:56:15,760
Oh!

2133
01:56:16,160 --> 01:56:17,820
Oh my god!

2134
01:56:18,650 --> 01:56:19,200
Yes!

2135
01:56:19,980 --> 01:56:22,660
I have hope!

2136
01:56:26,810 --> 01:56:32,170
From that one game, I received hope!

2137
01:56:35,590 --> 01:56:37,270
Oh my god!

2138
01:56:38,050 --> 01:56:42,210
Whoever tried to curse this, you're okay, my dude.

2139
01:56:42,390 --> 01:56:43,370
You don't get to be...

2140
01:56:43,370 --> 01:56:44,970
You don't have to be banned now.

2141
01:56:45,170 --> 01:56:46,710
Oh my god!

2142
01:56:47,770 --> 01:56:49,250
No, you don't have to...

2143
01:56:49,250 --> 01:56:50,410
You don't get banned!

2144
01:56:52,010 --> 01:56:52,530
Congratulations!

2145
01:56:58,170 --> 01:57:00,710
Simpleminded, thank you for the magenta super.

2146
01:57:00,950 --> 01:57:01,590
Thank you, thank you.

2147
01:57:03,070 --> 01:57:07,410
No, I swear to god, I will play.

2148
01:57:07,810 --> 01:57:10,250
I will play.

2149
01:57:12,170 --> 01:57:12,270
What?

2150
01:57:14,350 --> 01:57:14,950
What?

2151
01:57:16,370 --> 01:57:18,370
Excuse me.

2152
01:57:20,390 --> 01:57:20,550
Oh!

2153
01:57:26,330 --> 01:57:27,530
Oh!

2154
01:57:33,750 --> 01:57:35,750
Oh my god!

2155
01:57:38,140 --> 01:57:39,950
Oh my god, here we go.

2156
01:57:41,550 --> 01:57:43,590
This is fun.

2157
01:57:44,110 --> 01:57:46,750
Guys, I feel hope now.

2158
01:57:47,510 --> 01:57:51,010
I have a hope.

2159
01:57:51,010 --> 01:57:52,310
No, that's a good curse.

2160
01:57:55,610 --> 01:57:56,350
Okay,

2161
01:58:00,490 --> 01:58:01,290
here we go.

2162
01:58:01,710 --> 01:58:03,350
Wait, not Hawkeye?

2163
01:58:04,590 --> 01:58:06,870
What if they don't ban Hawkeye?

2164
01:58:07,330 --> 01:58:11,610
What if they don't ban Hawkeye?

2165
01:58:13,780 --> 01:58:14,810
Oh, thank god.

2166
01:58:15,190 --> 01:58:18,110
Thank fucking god, I was gonna...

2167
01:58:18,110 --> 01:58:19,430
Oh my god.

2168
01:58:23,930 --> 01:58:25,810
Oh my god, this is fun.

2169
01:58:30,970 --> 01:58:33,290
There's no good times up here.

2170
01:58:34,410 --> 01:58:35,810
Does he know he's open?

2171
01:58:39,310 --> 01:58:40,750
Does he know?

2172
01:58:42,270 --> 01:58:43,570
Oh, that's a good combo.

2173
01:58:45,150 --> 01:58:46,170
Oh, you should be a voice actor.

2174
01:58:47,110 --> 01:58:47,350
No.

2175
01:58:48,070 --> 01:58:49,730
Who is he talking to?

2176
01:58:49,730 --> 01:58:51,430
Why don't you become a voice actor?

2177
01:58:55,430 --> 01:58:57,490
Do you know what a voice actor is?

2178
01:58:57,990 --> 01:58:59,930
What the fuck?

2179
01:59:00,670 --> 01:59:03,750
Do you think a voice actor of um...

2180
01:59:04,890 --> 01:59:06,150
be a good character?

2181
01:59:06,350 --> 01:59:08,790
Wait, hold on.

2182
01:59:08,790 --> 01:59:09,550
You know what?

2183
01:59:10,150 --> 01:59:10,910
I don't know anybody.

2184
01:59:10,970 --> 01:59:13,070
No, I would never lie.

2185
01:59:13,370 --> 01:59:13,870
Simple-minded.

2186
01:59:14,070 --> 01:59:15,050
Simple-minded.

2187
01:59:16,010 --> 01:59:17,070
Simple-minded.

2188
01:59:17,350 --> 01:59:18,870
I would never lie.

2189
01:59:19,010 --> 01:59:19,810
Simple-minded.

2190
01:59:25,130 --> 01:59:26,330
Simple-minded.

2191
01:59:26,550 --> 01:59:29,030
Don't worry, we're gonna have God of War.

2192
01:59:29,270 --> 01:59:30,370
Dad's coming back.

2193
01:59:30,530 --> 01:59:33,570
He just needs to play a couple more Marvel Rival games.

2194
01:59:34,350 --> 01:59:38,130
It's like a gambling addiction, but much, much worse.

2195
01:59:38,450 --> 01:59:40,350
Cause I don't win any money.

2196
01:59:40,850 --> 01:59:42,910
But I lose a lot.

2197
01:59:47,470 --> 01:59:53,330
It is possibly much worse than gambling.

2198
01:59:53,690 --> 01:59:56,270
I wish I have a gambling addiction.

2199
01:59:58,850 --> 01:59:59,530
Okay.

2200
02:00:03,930 --> 02:00:06,150
Rude, what the fuck was Groot doing here?

2201
02:00:07,130 --> 02:00:08,430
Alright, focus up.

2202
02:00:08,490 --> 02:00:09,290
Focus up, Doki.

2203
02:00:09,810 --> 02:00:10,810
You got this.

2204
02:00:12,490 --> 02:00:15,190
Just do what you gotta do.

2205
02:00:18,640 --> 02:00:18,990
Okay.

2206
02:00:20,350 --> 02:00:21,350
No, no.

2207
02:00:21,490 --> 02:00:22,490
Dad's coming back.

2208
02:00:24,580 --> 02:00:25,750
Dad's coming back.

2209
02:00:28,540 --> 02:00:29,910
Dude, I can't even give him the bubble.

2210
02:00:35,510 --> 02:00:36,990
Dad's coming back.

2211
02:00:39,970 --> 02:00:41,690
Dad's coming back.

2212
02:00:43,990 --> 02:00:45,090
Yo, kill Star-Lord.

2213
02:00:46,550 --> 02:00:47,170
No, kill him.

2214
02:00:47,490 --> 02:00:48,270
He's one HP.

2215
02:00:48,850 --> 02:00:49,750
Everybody, one Venom.

2216
02:00:52,810 --> 02:00:53,710
Alright, nice.

2217
02:00:54,250 --> 02:00:55,070
Run away.

2218
02:00:56,350 --> 02:00:57,930
I haven't seen a good Venom.

2219
02:00:59,070 --> 02:01:00,350
It's like they just feed, dude.

2220
02:01:00,390 --> 02:01:02,150
It's like they can't even play characters like that.

2221
02:01:05,790 --> 02:01:06,750
I couldn't.

2222
02:01:07,910 --> 02:01:08,390
Alright.

2223
02:01:08,390 --> 02:01:08,750
Alright.

2224
02:01:09,250 --> 02:01:10,770
That was a sick freeze.

2225
02:01:10,950 --> 02:01:13,250
But to be fair, his hitbox was fucking giant as fuck.

2226
02:01:13,490 --> 02:01:14,970
I'm gonna give it to Mac, actually.

2227
02:01:17,570 --> 02:01:18,830
Oh, he's so low.

2228
02:01:21,750 --> 02:01:22,950
Oh, two support ults.

2229
02:01:22,990 --> 02:01:23,550
Let's go.

2230
02:01:25,010 --> 02:01:26,330
That's what I like to see.

2231
02:01:29,990 --> 02:01:30,650
There we go.

2232
02:01:30,770 --> 02:01:31,930
That's what I like to see.

2233
02:01:33,090 --> 02:01:35,290
Oh my god, that's what I like to see.

2234
02:01:35,290 --> 02:01:36,290
Okay.

2235
02:01:37,610 --> 02:01:39,450
Is everybody okay?

2236
02:01:40,150 --> 02:01:41,520
Are you guys okay?

2237
02:01:43,570 --> 02:01:44,910
Are you guys okay?

2238
02:01:45,030 --> 02:01:45,970
The other two are not.

2239
02:01:45,990 --> 02:01:46,450
Don't worry.

2240
02:01:46,810 --> 02:01:48,030
Don't worry, we're fine.

2241
02:01:50,350 --> 02:01:52,030
We're all so Gucci.

2242
02:01:57,110 --> 02:01:57,990
That's fine.

2243
02:01:58,110 --> 02:02:00,170
No, I'm not pocketing you, Black Panther.

2244
02:02:00,410 --> 02:02:01,510
I have a duo.

2245
02:02:03,190 --> 02:02:04,590
There we go.

2246
02:02:04,610 --> 02:02:04,990
There we go.

2247
02:02:04,990 --> 02:02:05,690
See, look at that.

2248
02:02:05,750 --> 02:02:06,430
I'm so locked in.

2249
02:02:09,950 --> 02:02:10,750
What's he gonna do?

2250
02:02:10,930 --> 02:02:16,390
The one thing I really did not want him to do.

2251
02:02:16,650 --> 02:02:17,450
He didn't.

2252
02:02:20,390 --> 02:02:23,410
I was like, he's gonna fucking ult.

2253
02:02:23,630 --> 02:02:24,510
There's no way.

2254
02:02:25,150 --> 02:02:27,930
There's no way he's gonna ult, guys.

2255
02:02:27,930 --> 02:02:30,410
There it is.

2256
02:02:30,410 --> 02:02:31,350
Alright, goodbye, everybody.

2257
02:02:32,050 --> 02:02:34,150
Like, I don't have anything for that.

2258
02:02:35,950 --> 02:02:36,690
Alright, here we go.

2259
02:02:37,030 --> 02:02:37,550
What's he gonna do?

2260
02:02:37,710 --> 02:02:40,150
I didn't even get to finish my sentence and he still did it.

2261
02:02:41,970 --> 02:02:44,050
I didn't even get a chance to finish my sentence.

2262
02:02:45,790 --> 02:02:47,250
Oh my god, she's one!

2263
02:02:49,790 --> 02:02:51,150
She's actually one.

2264
02:02:52,410 --> 02:02:53,350
Oh, I missed it.

2265
02:02:53,430 --> 02:02:53,810
Oh, nice.

2266
02:02:53,950 --> 02:02:54,510
Nice, nice, nice.

2267
02:02:55,710 --> 02:02:56,470
Alright.

2268
02:02:58,610 --> 02:02:59,750
You're fine.

2269
02:03:02,810 --> 02:03:04,290
You're so fine.

2270
02:03:08,170 --> 02:03:09,630
That's fine, just silence.

2271
02:03:11,030 --> 02:03:12,390
That's so good for us!

2272
02:03:15,890 --> 02:03:17,930
That's so good for us, actually.

2273
02:03:18,450 --> 02:03:19,790
Oh my god.

2274
02:03:22,150 --> 02:03:22,570
Alright.

2275
02:03:23,530 --> 02:03:25,030
Get over here, get over here.

2276
02:03:25,070 --> 02:03:26,450
Get over here, get over here.

2277
02:03:26,730 --> 02:03:28,710
Dance in my fucking ult.

2278
02:03:29,610 --> 02:03:30,170
Dance!

2279
02:03:31,150 --> 02:03:32,230
Dance in it!

2280
02:03:32,590 --> 02:03:33,890
And then I leave!

2281
02:03:35,050 --> 02:03:36,890
Oh my god!

2282
02:03:37,490 --> 02:03:38,810
It doesn't matter.

2283
02:03:39,090 --> 02:03:40,910
I still got fucked up.

2284
02:03:42,930 --> 02:03:43,810
It's fine.

2285
02:03:44,050 --> 02:03:45,350
Like, we're up?

2286
02:03:45,470 --> 02:03:46,570
I can't tell.

2287
02:03:47,510 --> 02:03:48,930
Oh, we're definitely up.

2288
02:03:49,010 --> 02:03:49,890
Hello, I'm up here.

2289
02:03:50,890 --> 02:03:53,210
Oh, we're definitely- Where am I?

2290
02:03:53,630 --> 02:03:55,230
Where am I?

2291
02:03:55,670 --> 02:03:57,390
In this fucking room.

2292
02:04:01,590 --> 02:04:03,650
Please, just focus on Venom.

2293
02:04:04,270 --> 02:04:05,330
Oh, no.

2294
02:04:06,850 --> 02:04:07,490
Please.

2295
02:04:08,090 --> 02:04:09,070
He's literally one.

2296
02:04:12,530 --> 02:04:14,050
Alright, we're fine.

2297
02:04:14,190 --> 02:04:14,890
We're still healthy.

2298
02:04:15,090 --> 02:04:15,670
Oh my god.

2299
02:04:15,990 --> 02:04:17,170
Oh, fuck!

2300
02:04:19,310 --> 02:04:19,850
Nice.

2301
02:04:20,150 --> 02:04:20,750
We're okay, too.

2302
02:04:21,230 --> 02:04:22,550
This is fine, too.

2303
02:04:24,750 --> 02:04:25,430
Oh, okay.

2304
02:04:25,490 --> 02:04:26,050
Here we go.

2305
02:04:26,410 --> 02:04:28,650
I'm so- I have one death.

2306
02:04:28,770 --> 02:04:31,470
That means I'm playing my fucking heart out right now.

2307
02:04:33,290 --> 02:04:36,270
I'm playing my goddamn heart out now, guys.

2308
02:04:36,750 --> 02:04:40,230
That one win we got, I feel so fucking inspired.

2309
02:04:40,970 --> 02:04:43,890
Like, I'm so inspired now.

2310
02:04:43,890 --> 02:04:46,470
I hit the fucking wall.

2311
02:04:47,870 --> 02:04:48,570
Okay.

2312
02:04:49,990 --> 02:04:50,690
Okay.

2313
02:04:51,550 --> 02:04:53,970
Now I feel inspired.

2314
02:04:57,690 --> 02:05:00,230
Okay, I feel inspired now.

2315
02:05:03,430 --> 02:05:04,610
Please get over here.

2316
02:05:04,990 --> 02:05:05,730
Please get over here.

2317
02:05:05,850 --> 02:05:06,370
You're so alive.

2318
02:05:06,370 --> 02:05:07,130
You're so healthy.

2319
02:05:07,650 --> 02:05:08,710
You're so healthy.

2320
02:05:08,990 --> 02:05:11,290
I told you guys, I feel so inspired.

2321
02:05:11,290 --> 02:05:11,430
You're so alive.

2322
02:05:13,050 --> 02:05:13,610
Okay.

2323
02:05:17,290 --> 02:05:19,030
Okay, um, kill Venom.

2324
02:05:20,790 --> 02:05:21,910
Please.

2325
02:05:22,870 --> 02:05:23,930
He's so low.

2326
02:05:24,770 --> 02:05:25,110
Nice.

2327
02:05:25,770 --> 02:05:29,890
I will- We're pushing.

2328
02:05:30,090 --> 02:05:30,450
We're pushing.

2329
02:05:31,410 --> 02:05:32,910
We're pushing.

2330
02:05:37,430 --> 02:05:38,890
We're pushing.

2331
02:05:38,890 --> 02:05:38,970
We're pushing.

2332
02:05:39,330 --> 02:05:41,130
Go get your ult charged.

2333
02:05:50,230 --> 02:05:52,170
Guys, guys, get in here.

2334
02:05:53,830 --> 02:05:55,210
Get in here.

2335
02:05:58,850 --> 02:06:01,990
Alright, let's dance and point, guys.

2336
02:06:02,130 --> 02:06:03,850
Let's fucking dance.

2337
02:06:04,710 --> 02:06:05,550
Oh no.

2338
02:06:05,550 --> 02:06:07,010
Oh no.

2339
02:06:09,770 --> 02:06:17,190
Guys, this is not- Guys, just- How did I- Who did I kill?

2340
02:06:23,190 --> 02:06:23,750
Oh,

2341
02:06:34,300 --> 02:06:34,660
I'm here.

2342
02:06:34,780 --> 02:06:35,060
Back.

2343
02:06:35,140 --> 02:06:35,600
I'm back.

2344
02:06:35,720 --> 02:06:36,160
Oh, goodbye.

2345
02:06:36,840 --> 02:06:37,520
I'm not back.

2346
02:06:41,620 --> 02:06:43,420
We just didn't kill Venom.

2347
02:06:43,840 --> 02:06:47,160
We just- We just didn't kill Venom.

2348
02:06:52,780 --> 02:06:55,620
We just- We just didn't kill Venom.

2349
02:06:55,760 --> 02:06:56,760
Oh, we killed Venom!

2350
02:07:00,800 --> 02:07:02,300
Here we go.

2351
02:07:15,850 --> 02:07:17,050
Oh my god.

2352
02:07:18,850 --> 02:07:19,490
Oh my god.

2353
02:07:19,490 --> 02:07:20,530
There was just too much damage.

2354
02:07:21,030 --> 02:07:22,270
There was so much.

2355
02:07:24,830 --> 02:07:26,170
Oh, we were so close.

2356
02:07:26,670 --> 02:07:27,790
We could defend it, right?

2357
02:07:33,210 --> 02:07:35,070
Oh my god.

2358
02:07:36,370 --> 02:07:38,430
Okay, we can defend this.

2359
02:07:38,970 --> 02:07:39,550
I'm inspired.

2360
02:07:39,730 --> 02:07:41,110
We did so well last game.

2361
02:07:44,790 --> 02:07:46,730
We did so well last game.

2362
02:07:46,810 --> 02:07:47,030
We did so well last game.

2363
02:07:47,030 --> 02:07:47,910
Wait, is there a black bar?

2364
02:07:48,190 --> 02:07:50,070
Oh my god, is my game not aligned?

2365
02:07:52,930 --> 02:07:55,230
Wait, there's no way.

2366
02:07:55,950 --> 02:07:57,870
No, it's supposed to be a black bar.

2367
02:07:58,290 --> 02:07:58,870
No, okay.

2368
02:07:59,110 --> 02:07:59,710
Oh, thank god.

2369
02:07:59,790 --> 02:08:01,590
You guys, like, actually freaked me out.

2370
02:08:01,930 --> 02:08:03,210
There is a black bar right here.

2371
02:08:03,310 --> 02:08:03,950
Wait, is it?

2372
02:08:04,230 --> 02:08:05,110
Is it part of the game?

2373
02:08:05,810 --> 02:08:06,550
I can't tell.

2374
02:08:07,430 --> 02:08:08,430
That's part of the game, right?

2375
02:08:08,430 --> 02:08:08,930
Yeah, it is.

2376
02:08:09,030 --> 02:08:09,250
It is.

2377
02:08:09,250 --> 02:08:10,090
It is part of the game.

2378
02:08:10,230 --> 02:08:13,190
Okay, you guys, like, actually got me so paranoid.

2379
02:08:13,670 --> 02:08:14,350
You guys were...

2380
02:08:18,850 --> 02:08:20,010
No, it is.

2381
02:08:20,330 --> 02:08:21,670
It literally is.

2382
02:08:22,130 --> 02:08:23,630
I have it on my screen.

2383
02:08:23,810 --> 02:08:24,790
I have the black bar.

2384
02:08:27,590 --> 02:08:28,690
It's like I knew it.

2385
02:08:28,730 --> 02:08:30,290
You guys fucked with me.

2386
02:08:32,810 --> 02:08:34,010
No, it's still there.

2387
02:08:34,070 --> 02:08:35,270
I literally see it.

2388
02:08:35,270 --> 02:08:35,490
I see it.

2389
02:08:37,770 --> 02:08:38,910
It's always been there.

2390
02:08:39,510 --> 02:08:40,890
Guys, it's always been... Guys.

2391
02:08:41,530 --> 02:08:42,050
Guys, it's fine.

2392
02:08:42,110 --> 02:08:42,810
We can defend this.

2393
02:08:42,950 --> 02:08:43,630
I'm locked in.

2394
02:08:44,170 --> 02:08:47,590
And after this, we're gonna drag that one-above-all guy into this stack.

2395
02:08:47,790 --> 02:08:50,130
And then, because, like, I need everyone to suffer.

2396
02:08:51,510 --> 02:08:55,290
If Chad is holding me hostage, then I'm gonna go out of war hostage.

2397
02:08:55,610 --> 02:08:58,530
And I'm also gonna hold everybody else in my stack hostage.

2398
02:08:59,050 --> 02:08:59,850
This is...

2399
02:09:01,690 --> 02:09:02,650
Oh, you're winning?

2400
02:09:05,270 --> 02:09:05,750
Hehehe.

2401
02:09:08,570 --> 02:09:10,250
I'm gonna hold everybody.

2402
02:09:10,610 --> 02:09:10,950
Oh, wait.

2403
02:09:11,010 --> 02:09:11,890
UI is off.

2404
02:09:12,030 --> 02:09:13,490
Oh, wait a minute.

2405
02:09:13,530 --> 02:09:14,430
I fucked it up.

2406
02:09:14,490 --> 02:09:15,250
Oh, no.

2407
02:09:15,610 --> 02:09:16,970
I moved it.

2408
02:09:17,050 --> 02:09:18,350
And I fucked it up.

2409
02:09:19,290 --> 02:09:20,430
Okay, this is bad.

2410
02:09:20,530 --> 02:09:21,530
Now the UI is off.

2411
02:09:21,570 --> 02:09:22,110
Oh, my god.

2412
02:09:22,130 --> 02:09:23,090
Everything is wrong.

2413
02:09:24,050 --> 02:09:26,090
Everything is going wrong, guys.

2414
02:09:28,730 --> 02:09:31,090
Everything is going wrong.

2415
02:09:32,850 --> 02:09:34,270
Oh, my god.

2416
02:09:35,470 --> 02:09:36,170
Oh, my god.

2417
02:09:36,310 --> 02:09:36,410
Okay.

2418
02:09:37,430 --> 02:09:38,090
It's fine.

2419
02:09:38,730 --> 02:09:39,330
It's fine.

2420
02:09:39,410 --> 02:09:40,430
I'll fix it when I'm dead.

2421
02:09:40,850 --> 02:09:42,670
I'll fix it when I'm dead, guys.

2422
02:09:46,550 --> 02:09:47,430
Oh, my god.

2423
02:09:47,590 --> 02:09:48,470
You kidnapped him.

2424
02:09:51,270 --> 02:09:52,110
It's fine.

2425
02:09:54,090 --> 02:09:55,210
Oh, my...

2426
02:09:55,210 --> 02:09:56,550
How did you...

2427
02:09:56,910 --> 02:09:58,950
I actually don't know how you died.

2428
02:09:58,950 --> 02:09:59,930
That was actually...

2429
02:09:59,930 --> 02:10:03,150
That was a lot of damage.

2430
02:10:03,290 --> 02:10:03,710
That was...

2431
02:10:03,710 --> 02:10:06,790
That was a lot of...

2432
02:10:06,790 --> 02:10:09,110
That is still a lot of damage.

2433
02:10:17,340 --> 02:10:18,740
Oh, my god.

2434
02:10:18,820 --> 02:10:19,900
Okay, I have to use it.

2435
02:10:20,520 --> 02:10:21,560
I have to use it.

2436
02:10:22,860 --> 02:10:24,180
I have to use it.

2437
02:10:24,460 --> 02:10:25,440
I have to use it.

2438
02:10:25,460 --> 02:10:27,360
It was either that or I fucking died.

2439
02:10:29,880 --> 02:10:30,520
It was either that or I fucking died.

2440
02:10:30,520 --> 02:10:30,840
I had to.

2441
02:10:31,760 --> 02:10:32,440
It was...

2442
02:10:32,440 --> 02:10:34,380
A risk that I had to take.

2443
02:10:35,220 --> 02:10:36,920
It was that or I fucking died.

2444
02:10:39,360 --> 02:10:40,760
I didn't want to die.

2445
02:10:41,700 --> 02:10:43,900
I really did not want to die.

2446
02:10:44,420 --> 02:10:44,620
I really did not want to die.

2447
02:10:44,620 --> 02:10:45,860
And lose a point because of it.

2448
02:10:48,160 --> 02:10:48,680
Alright.

2449
02:10:49,500 --> 02:10:51,140
We can live through this, right?

2450
02:10:52,080 --> 02:10:53,120
We just...

2451
02:10:57,760 --> 02:10:59,500
You can revive me with...

2452
02:10:59,500 --> 02:11:00,420
I don't know how to get him.

2453
02:11:02,480 --> 02:11:03,460
That's fine.

2454
02:11:04,040 --> 02:11:04,800
That's fine.

2455
02:11:08,060 --> 02:11:09,860
Where is the store lord?

2456
02:11:10,680 --> 02:11:11,300
Do it.

2457
02:11:15,090 --> 02:11:16,880
Adam is going to die though.

2458
02:11:17,360 --> 02:11:18,460
He is going to die.

2459
02:11:18,680 --> 02:11:19,020
No!

2460
02:11:20,720 --> 02:11:21,820
He is dead.

2461
02:11:22,280 --> 02:11:23,240
But I got him.

2462
02:11:29,590 --> 02:11:30,330
It's fine.

2463
02:11:30,570 --> 02:11:31,930
I saved your life.

2464
02:11:32,810 --> 02:11:35,310
You don't need to thank me.

2465
02:11:41,320 --> 02:11:41,730
Alright.

2466
02:11:42,410 --> 02:11:42,810
Nice.

2467
02:11:43,990 --> 02:11:45,090
God, I'm good at this game.

2468
02:11:46,030 --> 02:11:47,510
Why can't I climb?

2469
02:11:52,270 --> 02:11:55,310
Why can't I climb?

2470
02:11:55,310 --> 02:11:55,410
Why can't I climb?

2471
02:11:57,510 --> 02:11:59,150
I'm so good.

2472
02:11:59,430 --> 02:12:01,030
Why can't I climb?

2473
02:12:07,670 --> 02:12:08,250
Oh god.

2474
02:12:10,570 --> 02:12:10,890
Oh god.

2475
02:12:11,030 --> 02:12:11,030
Oh god.

2476
02:12:11,370 --> 02:12:11,750
Oh god.

2477
02:12:16,900 --> 02:12:17,580
Get him.

2478
02:12:17,780 --> 02:12:18,180
Get him.

2479
02:12:19,900 --> 02:12:20,420
Okay.

2480
02:12:21,340 --> 02:12:21,740
Oh my god.

2481
02:12:21,800 --> 02:12:22,800
Keep your fucking shield up.

2482
02:12:23,760 --> 02:12:24,280
Please.

2483
02:12:24,280 --> 02:12:26,640
What's going on on my screen?

2484
02:12:28,640 --> 02:12:30,280
Oh my god.

2485
02:12:31,660 --> 02:12:33,460
Oh no.

2486
02:12:36,580 --> 02:12:38,520
Go Wolverine!

2487
02:12:38,760 --> 02:12:39,260
Go!

2488
02:12:40,220 --> 02:12:41,620
Go Wolverine!

2489
02:12:41,780 --> 02:12:43,660
Goodbye Wolverine.

2490
02:12:43,800 --> 02:12:44,480
Goodbye.

2491
02:12:47,080 --> 02:12:47,220
Oh!

2492
02:12:50,280 --> 02:12:51,320
Oh!

2493
02:12:53,100 --> 02:12:53,620
Please!

2494
02:12:57,820 --> 02:13:01,460
Why did he fucking go again?

2495
02:13:03,180 --> 02:13:05,340
I was so happy.

2496
02:13:08,500 --> 02:13:09,960
I was so happy.

2497
02:13:11,600 --> 02:13:13,180
I can't believe it.

2498
02:13:13,180 --> 02:13:14,460
Oh fuck.

2499
02:13:15,380 --> 02:13:16,280
Who did that?

2500
02:13:16,500 --> 02:13:18,380
Who fucking did that?

2501
02:13:18,860 --> 02:13:20,160
I froze there.

2502
02:13:21,280 --> 02:13:25,660
Also, I realized we could have had a Mantis this entire time.

2503
02:13:26,440 --> 02:13:28,840
We could have had a fucking Mantis.

2504
02:13:29,360 --> 02:13:31,300
Mantis was playing.

2505
02:13:31,840 --> 02:13:33,510
Adam was a choice.

2506
02:13:35,760 --> 02:13:38,300
I should have thought Mantis was fed.

2507
02:13:40,360 --> 02:13:41,120
Although...

2508
02:13:41,120 --> 02:13:44,300
I can't believe it was a fucking choice!

2509
02:13:49,280 --> 02:13:50,800
It's never...

2510
02:13:50,800 --> 02:13:52,920
It's usually never a choice.

2511
02:13:53,140 --> 02:13:56,600
That's why I was like why is he avoiding me?

2512
02:13:57,260 --> 02:13:59,420
No you're not.

2513
02:14:00,680 --> 02:14:01,300
No you're not.

2514
02:14:01,640 --> 02:14:02,720
No you're not.

2515
02:14:04,800 --> 02:14:05,980
No you're not.

2516
02:14:10,430 --> 02:14:11,670
Oh my god.

2517
02:14:12,150 --> 02:14:16,770
Oh you're so healthy.

2518
02:14:17,210 --> 02:14:18,930
I'm fucking insane.

2519
02:14:19,870 --> 02:14:20,170
Okay.

2520
02:14:22,670 --> 02:14:23,930
Mantis first.

2521
02:14:24,290 --> 02:14:24,450
Okay.

2522
02:14:26,010 --> 02:14:27,730
Oh my god.

2523
02:14:28,850 --> 02:14:31,930
Oh my god.

2524
02:14:31,930 --> 02:14:32,530
I almost threw that.

2525
02:14:32,530 --> 02:14:34,030
Yeah, we just pop in.

2526
02:14:35,050 --> 02:14:42,990
That was like Mantis first.

2527
02:14:48,230 --> 02:14:49,050
Please ult!

2528
02:14:54,570 --> 02:14:56,490
Oh my god.

2529
02:14:57,110 --> 02:14:57,810
Oh dickhead.

2530
02:15:02,910 --> 02:15:03,730
Okay.

2531
02:15:03,730 --> 02:15:03,910
Okay.

2532
02:15:04,450 --> 02:15:05,730
Okay.

2533
02:15:06,230 --> 02:15:09,450
I was gonna be very scared.

2534
02:15:11,070 --> 02:15:11,570
Okay.

2535
02:15:12,490 --> 02:15:15,030
Alright, here we go.

2536
02:15:20,150 --> 02:15:21,430
Alright.

2537
02:15:27,510 --> 02:15:31,630
Oh my god.

2538
02:15:31,630 --> 02:15:31,930
Oh.

2539
02:15:32,230 --> 02:15:33,690
Oh fuck you.

2540
02:15:34,910 --> 02:15:35,870
Oh fuck you.

2541
02:15:37,010 --> 02:15:39,610
That's so many ults!

2542
02:15:40,530 --> 02:15:41,410
Chill!

2543
02:15:45,310 --> 02:15:47,350
Oh my god!

2544
02:15:47,650 --> 02:15:48,870
That was everything!

2545
02:15:50,510 --> 02:15:51,430
Oh my god, okay.

2546
02:15:53,930 --> 02:15:54,350
Alright.

2547
02:16:02,050 --> 02:16:03,090
Fuck you too.

2548
02:16:05,510 --> 02:16:06,970
Oh my god, Wolverine.

2549
02:16:07,210 --> 02:16:08,410
You're fucking crazy.

2550
02:16:09,810 --> 02:16:10,150
Alright.

2551
02:16:14,510 --> 02:16:17,150
Alright, fucking nothing.

2552
02:16:20,430 --> 02:16:26,130
Don't you love it when the ult gets absolutely nothing?

2553
02:16:42,170 --> 02:16:42,970
Oh!

2554
02:16:42,990 --> 02:16:45,190
Oh my god.

2555
02:16:45,450 --> 02:16:47,390
I have no heals.

2556
02:16:57,670 --> 02:16:59,930
Oh my god!

2557
02:16:59,930 --> 02:17:01,650
I fucking gave it!

2558
02:17:10,010 --> 02:17:12,610
Oh my god!

2559
02:17:13,090 --> 02:17:13,990
Oh my god!

2560
02:17:17,730 --> 02:17:18,670
I'm alive!

2561
02:17:19,410 --> 02:17:20,510
I'm alive!

2562
02:17:23,750 --> 02:17:25,210
Oh my god!

2563
02:17:25,750 --> 02:17:27,550
We did it!

2564
02:17:28,210 --> 02:17:29,270
Fucking nice!

2565
02:17:35,040 --> 02:17:36,280
Holy shit!

2566
02:17:36,500 --> 02:17:38,640
We actually lived!

2567
02:17:42,560 --> 02:17:44,760
Oh my god, I can't believe it.

2568
02:17:45,180 --> 02:17:49,920
We actually fucking lived through all that hell hole that we were in.

2569
02:17:50,460 --> 02:17:50,760
Alright.

2570
02:17:51,200 --> 02:17:52,620
I'm gonna message...

2571
02:17:52,620 --> 02:17:55,160
Oh my god, I can never have time to message the guy.

2572
02:17:55,980 --> 02:18:00,980
Be like, hey, you wanna lose all for one?

2573
02:18:04,900 --> 02:18:05,860
Pretty silly.

2574
02:18:06,680 --> 02:18:07,640
Pretty funny.

2575
02:18:08,720 --> 02:18:10,240
Oh yeah, I gotta fix the overlay.

2576
02:18:10,920 --> 02:18:12,420
Okay, let me fix it.

2577
02:18:12,920 --> 02:18:14,240
Oh my god, which one was it?

2578
02:18:14,260 --> 02:18:14,920
Was it this one?

2579
02:18:16,840 --> 02:18:17,240
Okay.

2580
02:18:17,700 --> 02:18:19,080
Well, I can't fix it yet.

2581
02:18:19,320 --> 02:18:20,880
Wait, did I fix my game though?

2582
02:18:21,520 --> 02:18:22,840
Is my game fixed yet?

2583
02:18:25,360 --> 02:18:27,220
My game is fixed, right?

2584
02:18:28,280 --> 02:18:29,520
I can't tell.

2585
02:18:30,720 --> 02:18:32,440
I can't tell.

2586
02:18:33,500 --> 02:18:34,180
Yeah.

2587
02:18:34,900 --> 02:18:35,680
Yeah, it is.

2588
02:18:35,720 --> 02:18:36,060
Okay.

2589
02:18:36,840 --> 02:18:37,560
It is.

2590
02:18:37,920 --> 02:18:38,840
And then...

2591
02:18:40,620 --> 02:18:43,160
And then we lock that in.

2592
02:18:43,600 --> 02:18:45,200
And then...

2593
02:18:45,200 --> 02:18:46,740
And then we'll figure this out.

2594
02:18:47,360 --> 02:18:49,340
We'll figure this out the moment I...

2595
02:18:49,340 --> 02:18:50,340
Oh, maybe it's like here.

2596
02:18:53,500 --> 02:18:54,060
Okay.

2597
02:18:55,280 --> 02:18:55,840
Hawk.

2598
02:18:57,040 --> 02:18:57,960
Oh wait, hello.

2599
02:18:58,340 --> 02:18:59,880
Oh, I almost clicked that.

2600
02:19:00,120 --> 02:19:01,180
That would've been awkward.

2601
02:19:03,920 --> 02:19:05,400
That would've been awkward.

2602
02:19:05,520 --> 02:19:06,320
I almost clicked it.

2603
02:19:06,540 --> 02:19:08,760
I saw Hawk and I was like, alright.

2604
02:19:12,080 --> 02:19:12,640
Oh.

2605
02:19:14,580 --> 02:19:15,140
Oh.

2606
02:19:18,660 --> 02:19:19,220
Okay.

2607
02:19:19,220 --> 02:19:19,700
Okay.

2608
02:19:19,980 --> 02:19:21,540
Do we have...

2609
02:19:21,540 --> 02:19:24,720
Do we have a Hawkeye player?

2610
02:19:25,100 --> 02:19:28,160
Do we have a Hawkeye player?

2611
02:19:29,140 --> 02:19:30,360
Oh, we do.

2612
02:19:30,500 --> 02:19:30,780
Okay.

2613
02:19:30,920 --> 02:19:31,620
Thank God.

2614
02:19:32,860 --> 02:19:34,760
Alright, back at it again.

2615
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:37,060
I can tank.

2616
02:19:37,120 --> 02:19:38,660
Oh, we know who the tank player is.

2617
02:19:40,760 --> 02:19:42,340
I should've banned Hawkeye.

2618
02:19:42,460 --> 02:19:44,940
I should've fucking... I should've never listened.

2619
02:19:49,220 --> 02:19:50,980
That's a really good Ironman.

2620
02:19:51,140 --> 02:19:51,520
I...

2621
02:19:53,080 --> 02:19:54,260
I saw it.

2622
02:19:54,660 --> 02:19:55,980
Played against it.

2623
02:19:57,520 --> 02:19:58,280
Fucking...

2624
02:19:58,280 --> 02:19:59,320
Scary as hell.

2625
02:19:59,520 --> 02:20:00,520
Scary as hell.

2626
02:20:04,980 --> 02:20:07,540
As if, like, not my fucking duo.

2627
02:20:11,640 --> 02:20:13,480
Oh my God.

2628
02:20:14,820 --> 02:20:18,260
Yeah, I totally played against this fucking Ironman.

2629
02:20:22,770 --> 02:20:24,220
I got you, bro.

2630
02:20:24,700 --> 02:20:25,660
They'll never know.

2631
02:20:26,860 --> 02:20:28,300
They'll never know.

2632
02:20:28,920 --> 02:20:29,580
I don't.

2633
02:20:29,760 --> 02:20:32,080
We'll switch later if you want, okay?

2634
02:20:32,180 --> 02:20:33,440
He does not...

2635
02:20:33,440 --> 02:20:38,460
That does not give me a lot of confidence when he says he doesn't Hawkeye.

2636
02:20:41,560 --> 02:20:42,000
Alright.

2637
02:20:42,820 --> 02:20:45,680
I'll have to walk up very slowly.

2638
02:20:48,860 --> 02:20:50,840
I'll walk up like this.

2639
02:20:54,280 --> 02:20:55,040
Alright.

2640
02:20:55,420 --> 02:20:56,840
I'm a little scared.

2641
02:20:57,400 --> 02:21:03,410
Oh my God.

2642
02:21:03,590 --> 02:21:04,230
Oh shit!

2643
02:21:06,770 --> 02:21:07,510
Where is that?

2644
02:21:09,210 --> 02:21:10,470
He's gonna rev.

2645
02:21:14,360 --> 02:21:15,160
Oh!

2646
02:21:17,200 --> 02:21:18,000
Oh!

2647
02:21:18,220 --> 02:21:19,020
That's awkward.

2648
02:21:23,240 --> 02:21:24,640
Oh, here he goes.

2649
02:21:25,840 --> 02:21:27,220
What's going on?

2650
02:21:27,540 --> 02:21:29,520
I'm... What's going on?

2651
02:21:30,000 --> 02:21:30,800
What's...

2652
02:21:30,800 --> 02:21:31,720
Guys!

2653
02:21:34,720 --> 02:21:34,940
Guys!

2654
02:21:35,420 --> 02:21:35,980
Guys!

2655
02:21:37,780 --> 02:21:38,580
Guys!

2656
02:21:40,080 --> 02:21:41,200
Guys, please!

2657
02:21:43,460 --> 02:21:44,200
Please!

2658
02:21:46,400 --> 02:21:47,840
He just...

2659
02:21:47,840 --> 02:21:49,660
He is just beating me up!

2660
02:21:50,220 --> 02:21:51,380
Oh my God!

2661
02:21:53,720 --> 02:21:55,060
Please just punch him!

2662
02:21:57,640 --> 02:22:01,200
Okay, I'm okay.

2663
02:22:02,360 --> 02:22:03,460
I'm okay.

2664
02:22:05,900 --> 02:22:08,240
How did he live for so long?

2665
02:22:12,700 --> 02:22:13,380
Alright.

2666
02:22:18,780 --> 02:22:20,480
He'll be fine, right?

2667
02:22:21,100 --> 02:22:22,460
He'll be so healthy.

2668
02:22:26,230 --> 02:22:26,930
Nice.

2669
02:22:28,730 --> 02:22:30,950
I will make sure you live forever!

2670
02:22:35,790 --> 02:22:36,910
Oh shit.

2671
02:22:37,290 --> 02:22:38,410
Who the fuck was that?

2672
02:22:40,470 --> 02:22:41,370
Who killed him?

2673
02:22:47,920 --> 02:22:48,680
Wait, what?

2674
02:22:50,720 --> 02:22:51,820
Oh my God, he's one!

2675
02:22:57,900 --> 02:22:59,900
Oh my God, I am...

2676
02:23:02,160 --> 02:23:03,360
Oh my God, he knows.

2677
02:23:04,800 --> 02:23:05,300
No!

2678
02:23:06,100 --> 02:23:06,980
Oh, I didn't ult.

2679
02:23:07,020 --> 02:23:07,440
That's good.

2680
02:23:08,400 --> 02:23:09,140
That's good.

2681
02:23:11,060 --> 02:23:11,780
That's good!

2682
02:23:13,400 --> 02:23:14,360
That's not good.

2683
02:23:19,300 --> 02:23:20,220
That's good!

2684
02:23:21,600 --> 02:23:23,240
What a combo!

2685
02:23:31,640 --> 02:23:32,200
Nice!

2686
02:23:33,160 --> 02:23:35,380
That guy had to be a Mercy player back then.

2687
02:23:36,940 --> 02:23:38,180
He has to be.

2688
02:23:40,060 --> 02:23:41,840
Okay, I gotta focus on my aim.

2689
02:23:41,920 --> 02:23:43,580
I'm like not even aiming anymore.

2690
02:23:43,640 --> 02:23:46,520
I'm just fucking shooting just for the sake of shooting.

2691
02:23:47,480 --> 02:23:49,800
Alright, where is Mac?

2692
02:23:49,960 --> 02:23:50,400
There you go.

2693
02:23:51,160 --> 02:23:52,780
I'll give him regen too.

2694
02:23:57,040 --> 02:23:57,940
Come on.

2695
02:23:59,300 --> 02:23:59,980
Stop!

2696
02:24:00,100 --> 02:24:00,920
Give me your head!

2697
02:24:06,080 --> 02:24:06,600
He has ult.

2698
02:24:07,240 --> 02:24:08,020
What the fuck?

2699
02:24:09,440 --> 02:24:11,400
What the fuck?

2700
02:24:13,820 --> 02:24:15,120
Yeah, but why?

2701
02:24:15,800 --> 02:24:16,900
He's literally one.

2702
02:24:17,400 --> 02:24:18,540
Like, why?

2703
02:24:22,860 --> 02:24:24,940
No, kill him!

2704
02:24:27,830 --> 02:24:29,310
He's so low!

2705
02:24:31,650 --> 02:24:32,550
There you go.

2706
02:24:34,330 --> 02:24:35,470
We'll be fine.

2707
02:24:40,510 --> 02:24:41,570
Alright, cool.

2708
02:24:44,390 --> 02:24:48,010
Sorry, there was like a giant man trying to fist us.

2709
02:24:51,010 --> 02:24:52,170
Alright, there you go.

2710
02:24:54,210 --> 02:24:55,170
I'm okay.

2711
02:24:55,550 --> 02:24:56,730
He's not though.

2712
02:24:57,730 --> 02:24:59,510
Oh shit, I'm okay.

2713
02:25:04,370 --> 02:25:05,590
I'm okay still.

2714
02:25:05,930 --> 02:25:07,370
I am not okay!

2715
02:25:07,650 --> 02:25:08,110
Like, what?

2716
02:25:13,190 --> 02:25:14,210
I'm okay.

2717
02:25:14,490 --> 02:25:14,910
Again.

2718
02:25:18,340 --> 02:25:19,660
I'm still okay.

2719
02:25:21,300 --> 02:25:24,120
Okay, that guy's movement is actually insane though.

2720
02:25:25,460 --> 02:25:27,560
Is he gonna fucking powder through it?

2721
02:25:29,280 --> 02:25:29,620
Nice.

2722
02:25:32,420 --> 02:25:35,620
Alright, nice.

2723
02:25:37,840 --> 02:25:38,520
Nice.

2724
02:25:39,380 --> 02:25:40,260
I'm on cart.

2725
02:25:41,660 --> 02:25:42,980
I'm on cart duty.

2726
02:25:43,180 --> 02:25:43,680
Vroom vroom.

2727
02:25:45,080 --> 02:25:46,600
Go, Mac, go!

2728
02:25:48,420 --> 02:25:49,080
Go!

2729
02:25:50,420 --> 02:25:50,440
Go!

2730
02:25:56,340 --> 02:25:57,560
I have sleep ready.

2731
02:25:58,740 --> 02:26:00,140
I don't have sleep ready.

2732
02:26:05,380 --> 02:26:06,040
No.

2733
02:26:06,380 --> 02:26:07,320
I'm asleep now.

2734
02:26:09,060 --> 02:26:10,760
I don't know if we're getting this.

2735
02:26:11,320 --> 02:26:11,840
There's...

2736
02:26:11,840 --> 02:26:13,520
There's a lot of stuff.

2737
02:26:13,520 --> 02:26:16,120
Oh my god.

2738
02:26:17,200 --> 02:26:18,380
He's mad though.

2739
02:26:24,020 --> 02:26:25,460
He's mad.

2740
02:26:29,340 --> 02:26:30,060
What?

2741
02:26:33,320 --> 02:26:33,680
No!

2742
02:26:34,120 --> 02:26:34,840
But we got it!

2743
02:26:35,200 --> 02:26:36,820
There's no more thing, actually.

2744
02:26:37,340 --> 02:26:39,800
Like, get the maximum pulse.

2745
02:26:42,780 --> 02:26:44,080
Alright, there you go.

2746
02:26:44,100 --> 02:26:45,180
My accuracy is better now.

2747
02:26:45,180 --> 02:26:46,240
I was a little worried.

2748
02:26:46,340 --> 02:26:47,740
I was like, oh no, it's hitting the 30s.

2749
02:26:51,660 --> 02:26:53,260
I'm starting to believe.

2750
02:26:53,640 --> 02:26:55,560
Guys, I'm starting to believe.

2751
02:26:57,220 --> 02:26:58,580
It'll be God of War soon.

2752
02:26:59,060 --> 02:27:01,040
It'll be God of... Please, trust me.

2753
02:27:01,160 --> 02:27:02,660
I never lied to you.

2754
02:27:03,240 --> 02:27:04,520
It'll be God of War soon.

2755
02:27:04,520 --> 02:27:05,520
We're so close.

2756
02:27:05,980 --> 02:27:13,600
Guys, we hit a couple of roadblocks along the way, but like, trust me, we're so there.

2757
02:27:13,860 --> 02:27:15,740
We're so there.

2758
02:27:16,960 --> 02:27:18,960
It'll be fine.

2759
02:27:19,400 --> 02:27:20,680
We're so there.

2760
02:27:25,800 --> 02:27:28,740
It'll be so fine.

2761
02:27:31,080 --> 02:27:32,840
We'll be there.

2762
02:27:33,120 --> 02:27:35,340
The moment we get there.

2763
02:27:35,860 --> 02:27:37,200
We'll be there.

2764
02:27:39,460 --> 02:27:41,160
Oh my god.

2765
02:27:41,160 --> 02:27:45,940
I swear to god, it'll be so worth it, guys.

2766
02:27:46,200 --> 02:27:48,760
The payoff will be so worth it.

2767
02:27:48,840 --> 02:27:51,620
No, guys, I don't need to change the thumbnail.

2768
02:27:52,900 --> 02:27:56,020
Just think about the payoff, guys.

2769
02:27:56,220 --> 02:27:57,660
Oh my god.

2770
02:28:01,940 --> 02:28:04,100
Just think about the payoff.

2771
02:28:04,740 --> 02:28:05,520
The value.

2772
02:28:05,520 --> 02:28:05,580
The value.

2773
02:28:08,180 --> 02:28:09,820
Are they portaling?

2774
02:28:10,140 --> 02:28:13,380
Are they portaling?

2775
02:28:13,580 --> 02:28:14,180
No, they're not.

2776
02:28:14,200 --> 02:28:15,080
He's jumping.

2777
02:28:17,220 --> 02:28:17,600
Jump.

2778
02:28:20,660 --> 02:28:21,420
Jump.

2779
02:28:24,100 --> 02:28:27,820
Oh my god, he's gonna fucking throw the Wolverine!

2780
02:28:43,820 --> 02:28:44,580
Oh my god.

2781
02:28:44,980 --> 02:28:46,800
Oh my god, they picked our healer, though.

2782
02:28:50,870 --> 02:28:52,790
No way, he's so low!

2783
02:28:58,670 --> 02:29:01,350
Um, yeah, but that's a lot.

2784
02:29:02,550 --> 02:29:04,570
I can't do anything about it.

2785
02:29:05,390 --> 02:29:08,550
Oh, good vibe, buddy.

2786
02:29:12,290 --> 02:29:13,570
Good vibe.

2787
02:29:13,830 --> 02:29:16,110
Don't worry, we'll be fine, right, Cloak?

2788
02:29:16,710 --> 02:29:18,850
We're gonna be so fine.

2789
02:29:27,290 --> 02:29:29,810
Oh my god, you're so healthy.

2790
02:29:32,650 --> 02:29:34,930
And Wolverine, that sounds so threatening.

2791
02:29:36,190 --> 02:29:38,250
Oh my god, he's coming in!

2792
02:29:42,590 --> 02:29:43,750
Oh my god!

2793
02:29:44,730 --> 02:29:46,350
Oh my god, we have to!

2794
02:29:48,930 --> 02:29:50,550
This is the only way!

2795
02:29:54,660 --> 02:29:55,640
Oh my god.

2796
02:29:56,380 --> 02:29:57,260
Oh my god.

2797
02:29:57,780 --> 02:29:59,060
I'm alive somehow!

2798
02:30:04,300 --> 02:30:08,540
It was nice being alive for like one second, not gonna lie.

2799
02:30:15,000 --> 02:30:19,080
I like that I was alive for a second there.

2800
02:30:19,520 --> 02:30:20,860
That's pretty crazy.

2801
02:30:30,540 --> 02:30:32,380
He's like...

2802
02:30:32,380 --> 02:30:33,260
Oh.

2803
02:30:33,820 --> 02:30:34,740
Oh.

2804
02:30:35,860 --> 02:30:37,860
Oh my god.

2805
02:30:39,600 --> 02:30:41,040
I slept him?

2806
02:30:41,720 --> 02:30:42,080
Okay.

2807
02:30:43,020 --> 02:30:43,520
Alright.

2808
02:30:43,980 --> 02:30:44,660
I don't know.

2809
02:30:47,560 --> 02:30:49,060
Where's that Iron Man?

2810
02:30:49,140 --> 02:30:51,660
I'm scared cause I don't...

2811
02:30:53,640 --> 02:30:54,500
Guys!

2812
02:30:55,460 --> 02:30:56,320
Guys!

2813
02:30:58,340 --> 02:31:00,380
Oh my god!

2814
02:31:04,570 --> 02:31:06,570
I miss our Adam, he is...

2815
02:31:06,570 --> 02:31:09,430
I... I miss our Adam.

2816
02:31:11,570 --> 02:31:14,170
I miss having Adam, guys.

2817
02:31:14,370 --> 02:31:15,010
I...

2818
02:31:17,470 --> 02:31:19,490
I miss having an Adam, guys.

2819
02:31:20,570 --> 02:31:21,090
They're...

2820
02:31:21,090 --> 02:31:23,270
They're pushing fast.

2821
02:31:23,490 --> 02:31:25,910
We're really bad at defense, guys.

2822
02:31:28,250 --> 02:31:31,170
I think we're really bad at defense.

2823
02:31:33,550 --> 02:31:38,870
Why didn't we ban Hulk?!

2824
02:31:38,870 --> 02:31:42,930
Oh, you're so healthy.

2825
02:31:43,650 --> 02:31:44,730
You're so healthy.

2826
02:31:44,730 --> 02:31:47,190
You're...

2827
02:31:47,190 --> 02:31:49,010
Oh my god.

2828
02:31:58,220 --> 02:32:00,680
I'm so unlucky.

2829
02:32:01,260 --> 02:32:02,820
I saw that too.

2830
02:32:05,540 --> 02:32:07,540
I'm so unlucky.

2831
02:32:11,320 --> 02:32:12,900
Oh my god.

2832
02:32:18,980 --> 02:32:20,360
Oh my god.

2833
02:32:20,360 --> 02:32:23,220
We all need heals, my guy.

2834
02:32:24,880 --> 02:32:27,620
We all need heals, my guy.

2835
02:32:30,600 --> 02:32:32,280
Oh my god.

2836
02:32:33,000 --> 02:32:35,720
I can't even damage boost.

2837
02:32:40,980 --> 02:32:42,360
Oh, he's so low!

2838
02:32:44,980 --> 02:32:47,300
Please get them, I...

2839
02:32:47,300 --> 02:32:48,620
Where is he?

2840
02:32:49,160 --> 02:32:49,680
Where is he?

2841
02:32:49,720 --> 02:32:50,760
Somebody slap him.

2842
02:32:56,650 --> 02:32:57,110
That's right.

2843
02:32:57,350 --> 02:32:57,810
Yeah!

2844
02:33:01,620 --> 02:33:02,160
No.

2845
02:33:02,900 --> 02:33:03,500
No.

2846
02:33:04,880 --> 02:33:05,440
No.

2847
02:33:06,600 --> 02:33:07,500
That's fine.

2848
02:33:08,720 --> 02:33:09,740
We fight, Hulk!

2849
02:33:10,320 --> 02:33:11,440
We fight!

2850
02:33:12,700 --> 02:33:14,220
Go, Hulk, go!

2851
02:33:15,160 --> 02:33:16,040
I'm coming back.

2852
02:33:16,120 --> 02:33:16,840
I'm coming back.

2853
02:33:16,920 --> 02:33:18,000
I don't wanna fight anymore.

2854
02:33:18,480 --> 02:33:20,940
I actually... I don't wanna fight anymore, Hulk.

2855
02:33:20,940 --> 02:33:22,400
I don't...

2856
02:33:26,820 --> 02:33:28,940
I don't wanna fight anymore, Hulk.

2857
02:33:29,080 --> 02:33:29,620
I...

2858
02:33:32,080 --> 02:33:33,160
Alright.

2859
02:33:42,370 --> 02:33:42,610
Cool.

2860
02:33:48,170 --> 02:33:49,730
What's going on?

2861
02:33:50,870 --> 02:33:52,930
Someone shoot him!

2862
02:33:52,930 --> 02:33:52,970
Shoot him!

2863
02:33:55,550 --> 02:33:56,430
This...

2864
02:33:56,430 --> 02:33:56,870
What?

2865
02:33:57,710 --> 02:33:59,430
Where's my Iron Man?

2866
02:34:04,670 --> 02:34:06,950
Like, what's just a fucking brawl?

2867
02:34:08,590 --> 02:34:10,450
I can barely keep up!

2868
02:34:12,530 --> 02:34:14,490
What's going on?

2869
02:34:18,570 --> 02:34:19,370
It's fine.

2870
02:34:19,370 --> 02:34:21,130
I killed their Mantis.

2871
02:34:21,430 --> 02:34:24,550
It's a fucking brawl right now!

2872
02:34:26,350 --> 02:34:26,630
Please.

2873
02:34:26,930 --> 02:34:27,890
Please get him.

2874
02:34:29,110 --> 02:34:29,430
Please.

2875
02:34:32,050 --> 02:34:33,330
Oh, fuck!

2876
02:34:34,050 --> 02:34:37,280
Wait, a fucking little rat!

2877
02:34:37,820 --> 02:34:38,960
You're such a rat.

2878
02:34:40,100 --> 02:34:41,980
You're actually such a fucking rat.

2879
02:34:42,900 --> 02:34:46,320
Oh my god, that Iron Man was such a fucking rat.

2880
02:34:46,520 --> 02:34:47,560
Holy shit.

2881
02:34:48,000 --> 02:34:50,020
He was a very smart rat though.

2882
02:34:51,460 --> 02:34:51,920
You know.

2883
02:34:54,770 --> 02:34:55,580
That's fine.

2884
02:34:59,210 --> 02:35:00,360
You're so much better.

2885
02:35:01,060 --> 02:35:02,560
You're so much better, Max.

2886
02:35:07,330 --> 02:35:09,450
Oh my...

2887
02:35:11,970 --> 02:35:14,210
Is my team okay?

2888
02:35:15,230 --> 02:35:17,710
Like, we're...

2889
02:35:21,800 --> 02:35:24,280
I don't think...

2890
02:35:25,560 --> 02:35:27,020
Oh my god, I didn't know!

2891
02:35:27,740 --> 02:35:28,580
I didn't know!

2892
02:35:31,560 --> 02:35:33,840
What the fuck happened?

2893
02:35:35,660 --> 02:35:36,820
Oh my god.

2894
02:35:37,900 --> 02:35:38,020
Shh.

2895
02:35:38,320 --> 02:35:38,740
Shh.

2896
02:35:38,780 --> 02:35:39,080
Tension.

2897
02:35:39,480 --> 02:35:39,700
Shh.

2898
02:35:43,740 --> 02:35:44,440
Shh.

2899
02:35:45,440 --> 02:35:45,980
Shh.

2900
02:35:56,430 --> 02:35:57,070
No.

2901
02:35:57,230 --> 02:35:57,830
No.

2902
02:35:58,890 --> 02:36:00,650
Get rid of that Mantis!

2903
02:36:00,770 --> 02:36:01,370
That's right!

2904
02:36:01,530 --> 02:36:03,270
Fucking fuck that Mantis!

2905
02:36:03,930 --> 02:36:05,250
I'm coming back.

2906
02:36:09,810 --> 02:36:10,070
Oh!

2907
02:36:21,950 --> 02:36:23,890
I'm not... No, I can't!

2908
02:36:24,350 --> 02:36:25,690
The Iron Man's back!

2909
02:36:26,830 --> 02:36:27,470
Please!

2910
02:36:27,790 --> 02:36:28,310
Please!

2911
02:36:28,530 --> 02:36:30,830
I'm so... I'm not close to ult, guys.

2912
02:36:30,830 --> 02:36:33,910
I am absolutely not close to ult, guys.

2913
02:36:34,410 --> 02:36:38,550
I am not close to ult at all.

2914
02:36:40,350 --> 02:36:40,990
Go.

2915
02:36:41,270 --> 02:36:41,270
Go.

2916
02:36:41,350 --> 02:36:41,670
Go.

2917
02:36:41,670 --> 02:36:42,050
Go.

2918
02:36:42,050 --> 02:36:42,390
Go.

2919
02:36:42,790 --> 02:36:43,130
No!

2920
02:36:49,270 --> 02:36:50,310
Oh my god.

2921
02:36:50,710 --> 02:36:52,210
I was not close to ult.

2922
02:36:52,470 --> 02:36:54,050
I was not close to ult.

2923
02:36:56,470 --> 02:36:57,670
Oh my god.

2924
02:36:57,770 --> 02:36:59,290
I should've went Jeff!

2925
02:36:59,990 --> 02:37:03,210
Just to be fast, I should've went Jeff.

2926
02:37:05,450 --> 02:37:07,090
Oh my god.

2927
02:37:09,170 --> 02:37:10,750
Oh my god.

2928
02:37:12,910 --> 02:37:14,130
This is fine.

2929
02:37:14,410 --> 02:37:15,450
Guys, this is fine.

2930
02:37:15,630 --> 02:37:16,170
This is fine.

2931
02:37:16,310 --> 02:37:16,750
This is doable.

2932
02:37:21,230 --> 02:37:22,850
This is okay.

2933
02:37:23,270 --> 02:37:25,570
Guys, we just got to believe.

2934
02:37:25,570 --> 02:37:31,270
Guys, it's all about believing.

2935
02:37:31,910 --> 02:37:33,550
Believe in ourselves.

2936
02:37:34,170 --> 02:37:36,410
We just got to believe.

2937
02:37:39,270 --> 02:37:41,930
We're so inspired!

2938
02:37:43,550 --> 02:37:44,990
I'll be fine.

2939
02:37:45,510 --> 02:37:49,170
Everything will be... Just believe, guys.

2940
02:37:49,390 --> 02:37:50,670
Just keep on believing.

2941
02:37:51,310 --> 02:37:53,770
Just keep on believing, everybody.

2942
02:37:54,130 --> 02:37:55,690
If you don't believe, I'll cry.

2943
02:37:56,470 --> 02:37:58,190
I'll cry.

2944
02:38:02,430 --> 02:38:03,270
No, guys.

2945
02:38:03,390 --> 02:38:05,170
Guys, we will have God of War.

2946
02:38:05,470 --> 02:38:07,390
I would never lie about God of War.

2947
02:38:07,670 --> 02:38:09,170
We will have God of War.

2948
02:38:09,590 --> 02:38:11,030
This is just a little detour.

2949
02:38:11,450 --> 02:38:13,890
A little detour to the God of War.

2950
02:38:18,630 --> 02:38:20,570
Just a tiny little detour.

2951
02:38:20,570 --> 02:38:26,940
Just a very tiny detour.

2952
02:38:27,500 --> 02:38:28,700
Yep.

2953
02:38:29,300 --> 02:38:31,760
A very small detour.

2954
02:38:42,690 --> 02:38:46,190
A very tiny detour.

2955
02:38:48,170 --> 02:38:49,370
Alright.

2956
02:38:55,630 --> 02:38:57,630
Alright, just...

2957
02:39:00,130 --> 02:39:00,810
Oh!

2958
02:39:04,630 --> 02:39:05,810
Very tiny detour.

2959
02:39:13,030 --> 02:39:13,710
Very...

2960
02:39:13,710 --> 02:39:15,990
Very tiny detour.

2961
02:39:20,260 --> 02:39:21,560
Oh, this is bad.

2962
02:39:22,200 --> 02:39:23,880
This is very bad, actually.

2963
02:39:24,220 --> 02:39:25,880
This is starting to get bad now.

2964
02:39:27,800 --> 02:39:28,480
Alright.

2965
02:39:30,520 --> 02:39:31,560
Alright.

2966
02:39:33,140 --> 02:39:35,200
Oh my God!

2967
02:39:35,340 --> 02:39:37,480
I don't live through that!

2968
02:39:40,260 --> 02:39:45,340
Okay, as long as you know, our other...

2969
02:39:46,300 --> 02:39:46,820
Okay.

2970
02:39:48,740 --> 02:39:50,120
Alright, I'm coming back.

2971
02:39:54,460 --> 02:39:54,780
Yeah!

2972
02:39:57,200 --> 02:39:58,600
It's fun!

2973
02:39:59,220 --> 02:40:00,020
It's fun!

2974
02:40:00,200 --> 02:40:01,920
I have to go jump to be fast!

2975
02:40:02,080 --> 02:40:03,300
Jump is the fastest support!

2976
02:40:06,480 --> 02:40:07,400
They got a tick!

2977
02:40:07,660 --> 02:40:08,920
Oh fuck, they got a tick!

2978
02:40:10,060 --> 02:40:11,560
They got a fucking tick!

2979
02:40:13,320 --> 02:40:14,080
It's fine.

2980
02:40:14,720 --> 02:40:16,140
A little tick won't hurt anybody.

2981
02:40:17,200 --> 02:40:17,980
It's fine.

2982
02:40:18,220 --> 02:40:21,360
It's when you have multiple ticks that it's a problem.

2983
02:40:22,660 --> 02:40:24,240
Yeah, but we already have a fucking rocket.

2984
02:40:24,420 --> 02:40:25,180
I can't...

2985
02:40:25,180 --> 02:40:26,220
There's nothing I can do.

2986
02:40:26,540 --> 02:40:27,440
I already have a rocket.

2987
02:40:30,660 --> 02:40:31,020
Alright.

2988
02:40:31,960 --> 02:40:32,900
Guys, we believe.

2989
02:40:33,280 --> 02:40:34,300
Guys, please.

2990
02:40:34,520 --> 02:40:35,800
Please believe, guys.

2991
02:40:36,180 --> 02:40:36,880
Please.

2992
02:40:37,600 --> 02:40:38,160
Please.

2993
02:40:39,760 --> 02:40:41,880
We got cursed for...

2994
02:40:41,880 --> 02:40:43,820
We got like times 10 cursed.

2995
02:40:44,380 --> 02:40:47,800
That every game I played was almost really fucked up.

2996
02:40:51,440 --> 02:40:52,540
Just believe.

2997
02:40:55,180 --> 02:40:55,620
Believe.

2998
02:40:56,180 --> 02:40:56,620
Believe.

2999
02:40:58,400 --> 02:40:58,840
Believe.

3000
02:41:00,220 --> 02:41:01,500
Alright, here we go.

3001
02:41:02,280 --> 02:41:03,700
Oh my god, 41% accuracy?

3002
02:41:03,860 --> 02:41:04,820
Let's fucking go.

3003
02:41:06,260 --> 02:41:07,500
I'm surprised, honestly.

3004
02:41:07,780 --> 02:41:10,280
I do not feel like I'm aiming very well right now.

3005
02:41:11,780 --> 02:41:16,440
I'm aiming for Luna, but for Mantis, I do not feel like I'm aiming really well for Mantis.

3006
02:41:17,140 --> 02:41:19,480
But hey, if it says 41%, I'll take it.

3007
02:41:21,400 --> 02:41:21,880
Alright.

3008
02:41:22,580 --> 02:41:23,960
Guys, don't stop believing.

3009
02:41:24,160 --> 02:41:25,700
If you stop believing, I'll...

3010
02:41:26,360 --> 02:41:28,720
It's like, if you stop clapping, I'll die.

3011
02:41:29,740 --> 02:41:30,900
I'm like a fairy.

3012
02:41:31,040 --> 02:41:32,680
You gotta keep on believing.

3013
02:41:36,370 --> 02:41:37,190
Oh my god.

3014
02:41:37,250 --> 02:41:40,150
Oh, it's like...

3015
02:41:42,860 --> 02:41:43,320
Alright.

3016
02:41:43,840 --> 02:41:45,120
Where is my Iron Man?

3017
02:41:54,600 --> 02:41:55,080
Alright.

3018
02:41:59,150 --> 02:41:59,790
Nice.

3019
02:42:05,700 --> 02:42:06,380
Get the Groot.

3020
02:42:06,600 --> 02:42:08,460
I will fucking beat your ass, Groot!

3021
02:42:09,680 --> 02:42:10,660
Beat his ass!

3022
02:42:17,940 --> 02:42:18,820
There we go.

3023
02:42:19,220 --> 02:42:20,720
I told you to believe.

3024
02:42:21,260 --> 02:42:23,540
I told you to believe.

3025
02:42:24,280 --> 02:42:24,920
Alright.

3026
02:42:25,700 --> 02:42:26,780
I told you guys.

3027
02:42:27,320 --> 02:42:28,580
Everything will be okay.

3028
02:42:33,000 --> 02:42:35,760
So, we will get to God of War.

3029
02:42:37,100 --> 02:42:39,560
We will get to God of War.

3030
02:42:40,020 --> 02:42:40,980
I will get water.

3031
02:42:41,140 --> 02:42:42,100
I'll be right back, guys.

3032
02:43:30,060 --> 02:43:32,340
Guys, we're back where we started today.

3033
02:43:33,420 --> 02:43:36,140
We're back where we started today, guys.

3034
02:43:37,320 --> 02:43:40,220
We're back to God of War now.

3035
02:43:41,800 --> 02:43:42,960
I'm so sorry.

3036
02:43:43,620 --> 02:43:45,140
We're almost there.

3037
02:43:46,260 --> 02:43:48,300
Just two more games, everybody.

3038
02:43:49,720 --> 02:43:50,600
Just...

3039
02:43:50,600 --> 02:43:53,420
We're back to two more games.

3040
02:43:53,680 --> 02:43:55,720
Let's fucking go!

3041
02:43:59,140 --> 02:44:00,580
Two more wins.

3042
02:44:01,180 --> 02:44:02,560
Two more wins.

3043
02:44:04,340 --> 02:44:06,520
Two more fucking wins.

3044
02:44:09,320 --> 02:44:11,960
I'm sup, but...

3045
02:44:11,960 --> 02:44:12,700
But what?

3046
02:44:14,140 --> 02:44:14,900
But what?

3047
02:44:16,060 --> 02:44:16,860
What?

3048
02:44:16,860 --> 02:44:17,920
Hiding my pick?

3049
02:44:18,060 --> 02:44:18,980
Because what?

3050
02:44:19,260 --> 02:44:20,900
What does that mean?

3051
02:44:21,280 --> 02:44:23,200
What the fuck does that mean?

3052
02:44:24,440 --> 02:44:25,240
Just...

3053
02:44:25,240 --> 02:44:28,180
Just pick your best support.

3054
02:44:28,300 --> 02:44:29,200
I can't flex.

3055
02:44:32,800 --> 02:44:35,620
Why are you hiding it?

3056
02:44:35,620 --> 02:44:35,720
Why are you hiding it?

3057
02:44:41,540 --> 02:44:42,980
Oh my God.

3058
02:44:50,060 --> 02:44:52,240
Alright, I'm banning Hawkeye.

3059
02:44:53,100 --> 02:44:53,960
Yeah, I'm down.

3060
02:44:54,760 --> 02:44:57,180
I'm willing to bet they ban Hawkeye and then I...

3061
02:44:57,920 --> 02:44:58,580
Oh shit.

3062
02:44:58,800 --> 02:44:59,800
I think they do Hawkeye, bro.

3063
02:44:59,860 --> 02:45:00,900
Honestly, I think it's fine.

3064
02:45:03,420 --> 02:45:04,800
Oh, come on.

3065
02:45:11,420 --> 02:45:12,380
Whoops.

3066
02:45:16,780 --> 02:45:19,120
Probability strikes again.

3067
02:45:24,900 --> 02:45:27,680
Oh my God, no.

3068
02:45:29,180 --> 02:45:32,540
Why did you tell me you were Raccoon One Trick?

3069
02:45:32,540 --> 02:45:34,560
I would have bet Mantis.

3070
02:45:35,000 --> 02:45:36,840
I would have...

3071
02:45:37,380 --> 02:45:39,960
Why would you hide it?

3072
02:45:40,420 --> 02:45:40,920
I would

3073
02:45:46,610 --> 02:45:47,470
have...

3074
02:45:48,230 --> 02:45:50,470
They wouldn't run Luna Mantis.

3075
02:45:53,230 --> 02:45:54,570
I'm okay.

3076
02:45:55,550 --> 02:45:57,550
Why would you hide it?

3077
02:46:02,370 --> 02:46:04,710
Oh my God.

3078
02:46:04,890 --> 02:46:07,630
The fact that he didn't hide it.

3079
02:46:07,690 --> 02:46:09,570
He hid it from me.

3080
02:46:09,950 --> 02:46:12,770
We could have... I would have banned Mantis.

3081
02:46:13,090 --> 02:46:14,850
I would have done it.

3082
02:46:15,310 --> 02:46:17,310
I would have fucking done it.

3083
02:46:17,590 --> 02:46:18,770
I'm not okay.

3084
02:46:24,070 --> 02:46:27,350
Why would they ban Raccoon?

3085
02:46:27,990 --> 02:46:29,230
Oh my God.

3086
02:46:29,230 --> 02:46:33,510
I would have...

3087
02:46:33,510 --> 02:46:36,230
I would have fucking banned Rocket Raccoon.

3088
02:46:36,410 --> 02:46:39,650
Who the fuck bans Rocket Raccoon?

3089
02:46:39,990 --> 02:46:42,210
No one would know you were a One Trick.

3090
02:46:50,840 --> 02:46:52,720
Oh my God.

3091
02:46:52,760 --> 02:46:54,280
There was so much damage.

3092
02:46:55,640 --> 02:46:57,160
Rocket was healing.

3093
02:46:57,780 --> 02:46:58,980
Okay, it's fine.

3094
02:46:58,980 --> 02:47:00,960
I died for the cause.

3095
02:47:02,600 --> 02:47:06,280
If they see the pink rocket, they think, what are they gonna think?

3096
02:47:06,360 --> 02:47:07,060
Oh my God.

3097
02:47:07,180 --> 02:47:08,940
That guy's a Rocket One Trick.

3098
02:47:09,520 --> 02:47:14,640
Who in their fucking right mind will think there's a Rocket...

3099
02:47:14,640 --> 02:47:15,840
will think that.

3100
02:47:26,000 --> 02:47:26,880
Oh my God.

3101
02:47:26,940 --> 02:47:28,040
That Strange is so low.

3102
02:47:29,120 --> 02:47:29,380
Goodbye.

3103
02:47:29,380 --> 02:47:29,600
Bye.

3104
02:47:33,340 --> 02:47:33,780
Whoa.

3105
02:47:37,000 --> 02:47:38,200
Oh my God.

3106
02:47:38,440 --> 02:47:39,780
This Mag is crazy.

3107
02:47:43,320 --> 02:47:44,200
Oh no.

3108
02:47:44,740 --> 02:47:45,300
Oh no.

3109
02:47:47,280 --> 02:47:47,720
No.

3110
02:47:50,840 --> 02:47:55,160
I'd just be like, if I see him on Raccoon, I'd just be like, he just wants to play Raccoon.

3111
02:47:55,280 --> 02:47:58,520
I would not think that he was a Rocket Raccoon One Trick.

3112
02:47:59,080 --> 02:48:02,100
That would never cross my fucking mind.

3113
02:48:10,920 --> 02:48:14,460
That would actually never cross my mind.

3114
02:48:19,130 --> 02:48:19,530
Alright.

3115
02:48:26,420 --> 02:48:27,720
Yoki is such a liar.

3116
02:48:27,740 --> 02:48:28,500
How am I lying?

3117
02:48:29,860 --> 02:48:30,920
Oh, it's just me.

3118
02:48:31,400 --> 02:48:31,700
Okay.

3119
02:48:33,320 --> 02:48:34,640
It's just me.

3120
02:48:36,680 --> 02:48:40,340
I just got I...

3121
02:48:42,800 --> 02:48:44,100
Oh, this is where I die.

3122
02:48:44,160 --> 02:48:46,160
Oh, this is actually where I die.

3123
02:48:48,440 --> 02:48:50,500
Wait, do we not have Wraiths?

3124
02:48:51,820 --> 02:48:52,320
That's fine.

3125
02:48:52,320 --> 02:48:53,540
We're at 99 anyway.

3126
02:48:56,260 --> 02:48:59,600
It was where I was gonna die, but that's alright.

3127
02:48:59,880 --> 02:49:01,420
It just hurt it a little bit.

3128
02:49:03,640 --> 02:49:05,800
Okay, that was a weirdo.

3129
02:49:09,520 --> 02:49:10,500
That's fine.

3130
02:49:13,420 --> 02:49:13,720
Sorry.

3131
02:49:15,940 --> 02:49:17,620
His movement was too good.

3132
02:49:18,000 --> 02:49:18,340
I...

3133
02:49:18,340 --> 02:49:21,300
Sorry, I had to like think a little bit.

3134
02:49:21,680 --> 02:49:25,840
I had to reset myself when I missed like three shots in a row.

3135
02:49:26,320 --> 02:49:29,880
I was just like, oh, that's not great at all.

3136
02:49:31,020 --> 02:49:33,100
That's actually not great.

3137
02:49:37,350 --> 02:49:38,100
That's three!

3138
02:49:41,920 --> 02:49:43,420
Oh my god, please.

3139
02:49:43,880 --> 02:49:44,480
Please.

3140
02:49:45,330 --> 02:49:51,440
I actually had to stand still and be like, alright, I gotta reboot my brain.

3141
02:49:56,260 --> 02:49:59,500
I think I saw Kratos somewhere in the background.

3142
02:49:59,880 --> 02:50:01,520
It's basically, I got a war level.

3143
02:50:01,520 --> 02:50:02,860
Oh, you think about it, chat.

3144
02:50:03,740 --> 02:50:04,940
If you think about it.

3145
02:50:06,740 --> 02:50:08,220
This is basically it.

3146
02:50:12,140 --> 02:50:14,480
Oh yeah, no, Carter fucking popped off.

3147
02:50:15,520 --> 02:50:24,440
I still can't believe Sylveon was like, I can't pick my character because I'm worried they'll target ban me because Doki Bird's a streamer.

3148
02:50:24,760 --> 02:50:27,400
Who in the fucking world would ever target ban Raccoon?

3149
02:50:27,480 --> 02:50:27,980
I like...

3150
02:50:31,600 --> 02:50:34,620
Who in the fucking world would ever do that?

3151
02:50:41,260 --> 02:50:44,560
I've never ever seen a Rocket Raccoon ban.

3152
02:50:46,200 --> 02:50:51,780
It's like the most worthless use of a ban I've ever seen if they ban a Rocket Raccoon.

3153
02:50:53,220 --> 02:50:54,180
This is God of War.

3154
02:50:56,600 --> 02:50:59,380
This is God of War.

3155
02:51:01,520 --> 02:51:02,960
This is God of War.

3156
02:51:05,860 --> 02:51:11,460
I like they tried a target ban and then they gave Mac a... Oh my God.

3157
02:51:15,360 --> 02:51:16,380
Jesus Christ.

3158
02:51:16,880 --> 02:51:18,420
I really need heals though.

3159
02:51:18,660 --> 02:51:22,280
But they gave Mac fucking hella like...

3160
02:51:26,540 --> 02:51:27,780
I'm capping point.

3161
02:51:28,200 --> 02:51:29,320
Stay on it.

3162
02:51:30,280 --> 02:51:31,440
I'm capping point too.

3163
02:51:33,240 --> 02:51:33,640
Okay!

3164
02:51:34,000 --> 02:51:35,420
You did not have to jump there.

3165
02:51:37,920 --> 02:51:39,440
Okay, that jump ball.

3166
02:51:40,700 --> 02:51:41,740
I hope I'm shooting.

3167
02:51:41,820 --> 02:51:43,300
Oh my God, I actually got him too.

3168
02:51:43,380 --> 02:51:43,960
What the fuck?

3169
02:51:44,620 --> 02:51:45,280
Let them come in.

3170
02:51:45,520 --> 02:51:46,060
I can't see them.

3171
02:51:47,680 --> 02:51:48,400
Where are they?

3172
02:51:49,440 --> 02:51:49,840
Oh.

3173
02:51:51,920 --> 02:51:52,800
Where are they?

3174
02:51:53,600 --> 02:51:54,680
Wait, they're not right side.

3175
02:51:54,820 --> 02:51:55,480
They're still here.

3176
02:51:56,660 --> 02:51:58,020
They're still here.

3177
02:51:58,780 --> 02:52:00,220
Oh shit!

3178
02:52:02,420 --> 02:52:03,240
Where?

3179
02:52:08,280 --> 02:52:09,380
That's fine.

3180
02:52:09,800 --> 02:52:10,900
Everything is fine.

3181
02:52:11,960 --> 02:52:13,800
Everything is fine.

3182
02:52:16,800 --> 02:52:18,140
Alright, nice.

3183
02:52:18,920 --> 02:52:19,560
We did it.

3184
02:52:22,240 --> 02:52:23,540
We did it.

3185
02:52:27,520 --> 02:52:28,400
Oh my God, they have a Thor.

3186
02:52:28,460 --> 02:52:28,720
CC!

3187
02:52:29,080 --> 02:52:29,380
Guys!

3188
02:52:31,080 --> 02:52:32,420
I need to break the stair.

3189
02:52:32,940 --> 02:52:37,800
I need to break the stair.

3190
02:52:37,880 --> 02:52:38,340
I got stuck.

3191
02:52:44,300 --> 02:52:44,820
Nice.

3192
02:52:44,960 --> 02:52:45,580
I did that.

3193
02:52:49,350 --> 02:52:49,870
Okay.

3194
02:52:50,830 --> 02:52:51,410
I leave.

3195
02:52:51,910 --> 02:52:52,990
I leave now.

3196
02:52:56,660 --> 02:52:58,080
Oh my God.

3197
02:53:00,580 --> 02:53:01,600
Are you guys okay?

3198
02:53:01,600 --> 02:53:03,180
Are you guys okay?

3199
02:53:03,760 --> 02:53:05,020
Are you guys...

3200
02:53:05,540 --> 02:53:06,460
Are you guys safe?

3201
02:53:09,990 --> 02:53:11,170
Are you guys okay?

3202
02:53:11,730 --> 02:53:13,010
Yeah, everybody is okay.

3203
02:53:15,790 --> 02:53:16,510
Yeah!

3204
02:53:20,690 --> 02:53:21,610
Beat her up!

3205
02:53:21,710 --> 02:53:22,070
Yeah!

3206
02:53:23,670 --> 02:53:25,590
I believed in you in beating her up.

3207
02:53:30,710 --> 02:53:31,430
Oh!

3208
02:53:32,190 --> 02:53:33,050
That was...

3209
02:53:33,050 --> 02:53:34,290
Okay, that was pretty good.

3210
02:53:34,450 --> 02:53:35,990
That was a pretty good ult.

3211
02:53:36,350 --> 02:53:39,750
Also, who the fuck watches the YouTube stream for stream sniping?

3212
02:53:40,790 --> 02:53:42,890
It would make sense if I was on Twitch.

3213
02:53:49,590 --> 02:53:51,030
Oh my God.

3214
02:53:51,930 --> 02:53:52,790
Oh my God.

3215
02:53:53,790 --> 02:53:55,090
I don't know.

3216
02:53:55,170 --> 02:53:57,030
If I tell them it's one more game...

3217
02:53:57,030 --> 02:53:57,830
I'm scared.

3218
02:53:58,590 --> 02:54:00,070
What he's gonna do?

3219
02:54:03,510 --> 02:54:04,910
I'm scared.

3220
02:54:05,610 --> 02:54:07,550
Last time I told him...

3221
02:54:07,550 --> 02:54:08,910
He went storm.

3222
02:54:09,330 --> 02:54:11,130
Last time I told him...

3223
02:54:11,130 --> 02:54:12,410
That I needed one game.

3224
02:54:16,730 --> 02:54:18,190
Oh my God.

3225
02:54:19,670 --> 02:54:21,010
This is it.

3226
02:54:21,570 --> 02:54:22,990
Guys, this is it.

3227
02:54:23,070 --> 02:54:24,610
Guys, it's time to believe.

3228
02:54:24,790 --> 02:54:26,770
Everybody, it's time.

3229
02:54:27,570 --> 02:54:29,430
It's time to believe.

3230
02:54:29,430 --> 02:54:30,070
Believe.

3231
02:54:31,050 --> 02:54:32,730
It's fucking time.

3232
02:54:33,270 --> 02:54:34,190
We're there.

3233
02:54:34,970 --> 02:54:36,990
We're gonna be there.

3234
02:54:39,810 --> 02:54:42,590
Alright, that's fine.

3235
02:54:42,670 --> 02:54:43,710
I can play Mantis.

3236
02:54:43,830 --> 02:54:44,570
That's fine.

3237
02:54:45,650 --> 02:54:48,410
I'm very...

3238
02:54:48,410 --> 02:54:49,790
I don't care.

3239
02:54:50,490 --> 02:54:52,470
Winter Soldier.

3240
02:54:52,470 --> 02:54:52,630
Winter Soldier.

3241
02:54:55,350 --> 02:54:59,410
They have three magic players?

3242
02:54:59,770 --> 02:55:01,490
Okay, I'm banning magic then.

3243
02:55:05,850 --> 02:55:08,530
Yeah, but then none of them can play magic.

3244
02:55:15,350 --> 02:55:15,930
Um...

3245
02:55:15,930 --> 02:55:16,930
Then what do we do?

3246
02:55:19,750 --> 02:55:21,310
But what about Hawkeye?

3247
02:55:21,310 --> 02:55:23,450
What about Hawkeye?

3248
02:55:25,570 --> 02:55:29,310
Magic is a bigger problem than...

3249
02:55:32,470 --> 02:55:34,970
Winter Soldier, I feel like.

3250
02:55:36,950 --> 02:55:37,350
Okay.

3251
02:55:39,910 --> 02:55:42,690
Do we have a Hawkeye player?

3252
02:55:45,510 --> 02:55:47,730
I don't think it's worth playing on offense on this map.

3253
02:55:47,730 --> 02:55:49,470
At the first player list.

3254
02:55:49,750 --> 02:55:50,110
Alright.

3255
02:55:51,850 --> 02:55:52,830
That's fine.

3256
02:55:53,350 --> 02:55:53,970
Wait, what the fuck?

3257
02:55:54,030 --> 02:55:55,070
It's bugging out.

3258
02:55:55,190 --> 02:55:57,890
Oh no, they're just fucking around.

3259
02:55:58,610 --> 02:55:59,750
Yeah, they're just fucking around.

3260
02:55:59,850 --> 02:56:01,390
I like...

3261
02:56:01,390 --> 02:56:03,710
Okay, it's bugging the fuck out.

3262
02:56:03,890 --> 02:56:05,530
Like, I don't like this.

3263
02:56:08,410 --> 02:56:08,970
Alright.

3264
02:56:10,270 --> 02:56:12,070
Oh my god.

3265
02:56:13,150 --> 02:56:15,290
My friend sent me this.

3266
02:56:15,290 --> 02:56:17,030
I'm so sorry.

3267
02:56:19,100 --> 02:56:21,870
My friend sent me this thing.

3268
02:56:23,970 --> 02:56:25,130
I need it.

3269
02:56:26,530 --> 02:56:28,170
Who made this edit?

3270
02:56:28,530 --> 02:56:30,990
Who the fuck made this edit?

3271
02:56:33,200 --> 02:56:35,150
I was sent...

3272
02:56:35,150 --> 02:56:37,470
I was sent...

3273
02:56:37,470 --> 02:56:40,270
I was sent this.

3274
02:56:40,990 --> 02:56:42,010
I'm so...

3275
02:56:56,720 --> 02:56:57,280
Alright.

3276
02:57:00,620 --> 02:57:01,880
Wait, is that a spider?

3277
02:57:02,140 --> 02:57:02,660
Okay, no.

3278
02:57:04,300 --> 02:57:05,220
Oh, thank god.

3279
02:57:05,660 --> 02:57:06,940
I'm so happy.

3280
02:57:14,260 --> 02:57:15,480
Oh wait, what the fuck?

3281
02:57:15,980 --> 02:57:20,380
Where is she?

3282
02:57:20,380 --> 02:57:21,860
Wait, what's my ping?

3283
02:57:23,240 --> 02:57:24,620
Like, am I not hitting any of these?

3284
02:57:27,040 --> 02:57:28,600
Okay, we should have bad magic.

3285
02:57:28,820 --> 02:57:30,720
We should have 100% bad magic.

3286
02:57:35,180 --> 02:57:36,340
What the fuck?

3287
02:57:36,600 --> 02:57:37,620
Where's my ping?

3288
02:57:37,880 --> 02:57:39,280
Where's my hit register here?

3289
02:57:39,360 --> 02:57:39,980
Oh, there we go.

3290
02:57:40,440 --> 02:57:40,900
Finally.

3291
02:57:41,700 --> 02:57:42,720
I was like, the fuck?

3292
02:57:42,780 --> 02:57:43,960
I should be hitting these.

3293
02:57:44,840 --> 02:57:46,080
Oh my god.

3294
02:57:46,940 --> 02:57:49,360
Her, like, portal shit is really good.

3295
02:57:52,770 --> 02:57:53,570
Okay.

3296
02:57:58,950 --> 02:57:59,710
Okay.

3297
02:57:59,710 --> 02:58:00,090
Someone, please.

3298
02:58:00,630 --> 02:58:02,310
Get rid of...

3299
02:58:03,010 --> 02:58:04,010
There we go.

3300
02:58:04,330 --> 02:58:05,570
There we go, we did it.

3301
02:58:05,830 --> 02:58:07,130
We did it, everybody.

3302
02:58:07,570 --> 02:58:09,390
Raid boss down.

3303
02:58:12,490 --> 02:58:14,550
We fucking did it.

3304
02:58:18,050 --> 02:58:19,710
We fucking did it.

3305
02:58:21,050 --> 02:58:22,450
Okay, that's good.

3306
02:58:23,390 --> 02:58:24,090
That's good.

3307
02:58:24,250 --> 02:58:24,670
That's good that I...

3308
02:58:25,830 --> 02:58:29,650
That's good that I, like, did that before he did all that other shit.

3309
02:58:32,730 --> 02:58:34,150
Oh my god.

3310
02:58:37,050 --> 02:58:37,610
Okay.

3311
02:58:41,190 --> 02:58:41,750
Alright.

3312
02:58:45,840 --> 02:58:46,400
Guys.

3313
02:58:49,180 --> 02:58:49,740
Guys.

3314
02:58:49,740 --> 02:58:50,420
Guys.

3315
02:58:51,500 --> 02:58:53,660
I'm a little scared.

3316
02:59:01,960 --> 02:59:04,920
I'm a little scared, guys.

3317
02:59:06,850 --> 02:59:09,940
This progression is not what I like.

3318
02:59:15,160 --> 02:59:17,520
Shoot the fucking water.

3319
02:59:19,320 --> 02:59:19,660
Alright.

3320
02:59:21,160 --> 02:59:22,820
I believe in them to kill the Starlord.

3321
02:59:22,820 --> 02:59:24,340
Oh, thank god.

3322
02:59:25,080 --> 02:59:25,560
Alright.

3323
02:59:25,980 --> 02:59:26,420
I'm locking.

3324
02:59:26,580 --> 02:59:26,660
Okay.

3325
02:59:26,800 --> 02:59:28,240
I actually have to lock in, though.

3326
02:59:29,040 --> 02:59:30,020
I locked in my aim.

3327
02:59:30,080 --> 02:59:32,100
My aim was, like, not great there.

3328
02:59:37,770 --> 02:59:38,250
Okay.

3329
02:59:40,310 --> 02:59:40,990
Come on.

3330
02:59:41,330 --> 02:59:42,450
I'm so locked in.

3331
02:59:45,670 --> 02:59:46,690
Oh my god.

3332
02:59:48,050 --> 02:59:48,570
Come back.

3333
02:59:51,430 --> 02:59:52,210
It's fine.

3334
02:59:52,270 --> 02:59:52,750
I'm okay.

3335
02:59:52,750 --> 02:59:53,790
I'm okay.

3336
02:59:53,870 --> 02:59:55,230
It was worth beating a little bit.

3337
03:00:00,160 --> 03:00:01,000
That's fine.

3338
03:00:01,680 --> 03:00:03,060
That's so fine.

3339
03:00:05,540 --> 03:00:06,080
Okay.

3340
03:00:06,400 --> 03:00:07,500
That's so fine.

3341
03:00:08,480 --> 03:00:11,160
I can't see him, but, like, I think I'm hitting him.

3342
03:00:12,360 --> 03:00:15,500
Like, I'm like, I think I'm hitting him.

3343
03:00:15,700 --> 03:00:19,020
Like, I can't see where it is, but it looks like I am.

3344
03:00:21,040 --> 03:00:21,580
Alright.

3345
03:00:22,920 --> 03:00:23,220
Alright.

3346
03:00:23,220 --> 03:00:23,320
Okay.

3347
03:00:23,900 --> 03:00:24,840
Told you I'm locked in.

3348
03:00:26,280 --> 03:00:26,980
Told you.

3349
03:00:27,780 --> 03:00:29,200
I would never lie.

3350
03:00:33,950 --> 03:00:35,330
They're so... they're gonna run in.

3351
03:00:35,990 --> 03:00:36,610
They're...

3352
03:00:36,610 --> 03:00:36,890
Oh!

3353
03:00:38,570 --> 03:00:39,190
Oh!

3354
03:00:40,930 --> 03:00:41,550
Oh!

3355
03:00:44,390 --> 03:00:44,950
Oh!

3356
03:00:45,830 --> 03:00:46,090
Oh!

3357
03:00:46,890 --> 03:00:47,270
Goodbye.

3358
03:00:47,930 --> 03:00:49,530
I'm gonna leave.

3359
03:00:50,070 --> 03:00:51,590
I'm gonna...

3360
03:00:51,590 --> 03:00:51,930
Alright.

3361
03:00:52,030 --> 03:00:54,390
Oh, we have... we have Legendary.

3362
03:00:56,330 --> 03:00:56,850
Legendary.

3363
03:00:57,910 --> 03:00:58,670
Oh, and he's dead.

3364
03:00:59,390 --> 03:00:59,970
And he's dead.

3365
03:01:00,190 --> 03:01:00,630
That's fine.

3366
03:01:01,330 --> 03:01:02,170
We don't need him yet.

3367
03:01:03,490 --> 03:01:04,990
He'll exist for us soon.

3368
03:01:05,250 --> 03:01:06,390
We don't need him yet.

3369
03:01:09,890 --> 03:01:11,410
I hear him above us.

3370
03:01:13,650 --> 03:01:14,170
Nice.

3371
03:01:15,830 --> 03:01:18,350
Oh, he has... he has... he has ult.

3372
03:01:25,110 --> 03:01:25,710
Oh!

3373
03:01:26,010 --> 03:01:26,790
Okay, that's fine.

3374
03:01:29,330 --> 03:01:30,470
Go do your thing.

3375
03:01:32,530 --> 03:01:33,590
Go do your thing.

3376
03:01:33,690 --> 03:01:34,430
Just shoot him.

3377
03:01:38,090 --> 03:01:38,990
That's fine.

3378
03:01:39,530 --> 03:01:40,530
We don't care about you.

3379
03:01:44,590 --> 03:01:44,810
Alright.

3380
03:01:45,830 --> 03:01:47,490
I'm going in back.

3381
03:01:52,860 --> 03:01:54,040
I'm going in.

3382
03:01:54,160 --> 03:01:55,320
We can kill him together.

3383
03:01:57,580 --> 03:01:59,540
Okay, I'm backing out a little bit.

3384
03:01:59,940 --> 03:02:01,200
Oh, I'm looking up.

3385
03:02:01,680 --> 03:02:02,740
Oh, I looked up.

3386
03:02:02,900 --> 03:02:03,640
I looked up.

3387
03:02:03,960 --> 03:02:04,760
I looked up.

3388
03:02:05,460 --> 03:02:06,460
Gamers looked up.

3389
03:02:07,720 --> 03:02:08,780
You can't blame that on me.

3390
03:02:08,880 --> 03:02:09,620
I actually did.

3391
03:02:11,420 --> 03:02:13,800
I did try so hard to look up.

3392
03:02:20,060 --> 03:02:21,880
It's not like I did not do the thing.

3393
03:02:27,820 --> 03:02:29,020
Alright, I...

3394
03:02:29,020 --> 03:02:30,580
don't have anything for that.

3395
03:02:32,660 --> 03:02:33,220
No!

3396
03:02:33,400 --> 03:02:34,360
Oh my god!

3397
03:02:34,420 --> 03:02:35,520
No, he still died.

3398
03:02:36,640 --> 03:02:37,200
Oh, nice!

3399
03:02:37,320 --> 03:02:37,840
Oh, nice!

3400
03:02:38,600 --> 03:02:39,620
But it didn't matter.

3401
03:02:39,880 --> 03:02:42,120
But we got the spoil of...

3402
03:02:43,980 --> 03:02:44,840
That's great.

3403
03:02:54,210 --> 03:02:55,130
Oh my god!

3404
03:02:55,190 --> 03:02:55,470
What?

3405
03:02:56,290 --> 03:02:57,850
No, he was so low.

3406
03:02:58,290 --> 03:02:59,650
He was so bad.

3407
03:02:59,650 --> 03:02:59,810
He was so bad.

3408
03:03:02,130 --> 03:03:03,930
Mack, I swear to god.

3409
03:03:04,270 --> 03:03:05,050
Do not die.

3410
03:03:05,770 --> 03:03:07,110
Do not die on me.

3411
03:03:10,250 --> 03:03:11,730
Do not die on...

3412
03:03:11,730 --> 03:03:12,490
Oh, okay.

3413
03:03:12,550 --> 03:03:13,150
He died on me.

3414
03:03:14,150 --> 03:03:15,030
Oh my god.

3415
03:03:15,290 --> 03:03:15,830
It's okay.

3416
03:03:17,270 --> 03:03:20,290
I don't know what's going on anymore.

3417
03:03:23,010 --> 03:03:26,310
There's so many things happening on my screen.

3418
03:03:31,210 --> 03:03:31,990
Oh my god.

3419
03:03:33,310 --> 03:03:34,190
There's like...

3420
03:03:34,190 --> 03:03:36,070
Everybody's just running around.

3421
03:03:36,690 --> 03:03:38,990
It's so cluttered on my screen.

3422
03:03:41,590 --> 03:03:42,150
Alright.

3423
03:03:44,750 --> 03:03:46,290
Everything was so cluttered.

3424
03:03:46,310 --> 03:03:47,730
It was actually so difficult to see.

3425
03:03:52,000 --> 03:03:53,000
Oh my god.

3426
03:03:53,040 --> 03:03:53,520
No!

3427
03:03:56,020 --> 03:03:58,220
We almost killed... Okay, it's fine.

3428
03:03:58,260 --> 03:03:59,100
We still have one more fight.

3429
03:03:59,660 --> 03:04:00,340
I threw there.

3430
03:04:00,940 --> 03:04:01,820
I threw there.

3431
03:04:01,960 --> 03:04:04,200
I shouldn't have fucking ran up just to try to slap him.

3432
03:04:04,320 --> 03:04:06,000
I just really wanted to slap him.

3433
03:04:06,060 --> 03:04:06,920
You don't understand.

3434
03:04:08,780 --> 03:04:12,140
I just really wanted to slap him.

3435
03:04:17,950 --> 03:04:18,450
Nice.

3436
03:04:19,050 --> 03:04:20,450
I don't know how I did that.

3437
03:04:21,570 --> 03:04:22,070
What?

3438
03:04:26,570 --> 03:04:32,340
He just sat there and...

3439
03:04:32,340 --> 03:04:33,240
Oh hey, that's me.

3440
03:04:42,020 --> 03:04:42,660
No!

3441
03:04:43,280 --> 03:04:44,980
I couldn't get out!

3442
03:04:47,620 --> 03:04:48,580
Not legendary!

3443
03:04:51,120 --> 03:04:52,860
I got legendary'd.

3444
03:04:53,420 --> 03:04:54,200
Oh my god.

3445
03:04:54,300 --> 03:04:55,160
Come on, come on, come on.

3446
03:04:55,220 --> 03:04:56,540
I'm almost here.

3447
03:04:57,140 --> 03:04:57,600
There we

3448
03:05:02,810 --> 03:05:05,210
go.

3449
03:05:14,590 --> 03:05:15,430
Oh my god.

3450
03:05:15,630 --> 03:05:15,970
No!

3451
03:05:16,750 --> 03:05:17,810
I can't do anything!

3452
03:05:18,110 --> 03:05:19,850
I'm scared about losing the cart!

3453
03:05:19,850 --> 03:05:19,890
I'm scared!

3454
03:05:21,950 --> 03:05:23,010
It's time!

3455
03:05:23,690 --> 03:05:24,730
I'm pulling it out!

3456
03:05:28,450 --> 03:05:29,230
Pulling it out!

3457
03:05:33,430 --> 03:05:36,390
I haven't played Jeff in fucking years.

3458
03:05:49,850 --> 03:05:50,970
Oh my god.

3459
03:05:52,550 --> 03:05:54,130
No fucking way!

3460
03:05:56,750 --> 03:05:58,430
Just a little shirk!

3461
03:06:00,460 --> 03:06:02,250
What do I do in that situation?

3462
03:06:02,830 --> 03:06:04,630
He literally just fucking...

3463
03:06:04,630 --> 03:06:05,930
Oh my god, okay.

3464
03:06:08,250 --> 03:06:08,670
Roz.

3465
03:06:09,470 --> 03:06:10,750
Just Roz.

3466
03:06:11,450 --> 03:06:12,990
Oh my god.

3467
03:06:13,010 --> 03:06:14,110
He literally...

3468
03:06:14,110 --> 03:06:16,370
He literally punted me up in the air!

3469
03:06:19,670 --> 03:06:21,990
How do I shift?

3470
03:06:22,630 --> 03:06:24,210
I was in the fucking air!

3471
03:06:26,990 --> 03:06:28,750
Oh my god.

3472
03:06:29,630 --> 03:06:34,450
He literally fucking punted me up in the air and I just had to live with it.

3473
03:06:40,430 --> 03:06:41,390
I tried.

3474
03:06:41,830 --> 03:06:43,070
I pressed shift.

3475
03:06:43,210 --> 03:06:44,210
It was too late.

3476
03:06:44,690 --> 03:06:46,830
He knew what he wanted to do.

3477
03:06:47,250 --> 03:06:49,430
Just sit there and watch.

3478
03:06:49,710 --> 03:06:51,870
I sat there and watched it happen.

3479
03:06:57,770 --> 03:06:58,790
It's okay.

3480
03:06:59,450 --> 03:07:00,390
It's okay.

3481
03:07:00,390 --> 03:07:00,630
It's okay.

3482
03:07:00,750 --> 03:07:02,650
I am alive.

3483
03:07:04,390 --> 03:07:06,470
And now we defend.

3484
03:07:09,070 --> 03:07:10,650
Guys, don't worry.

3485
03:07:11,990 --> 03:07:12,670
Technically...

3486
03:07:13,430 --> 03:07:14,110
Technically...

3487
03:07:14,110 --> 03:07:15,990
There was Thor and Loki there.

3488
03:07:16,470 --> 03:07:18,250
Guys, I'm green just like Loki.

3489
03:07:18,530 --> 03:07:20,070
So technically...

3490
03:07:20,070 --> 03:07:21,430
Technically, I'm...

3491
03:07:21,430 --> 03:07:23,730
I'm playing God of War right now.

3492
03:07:23,730 --> 03:07:24,870
I heard that.

3493
03:07:27,470 --> 03:07:29,690
It's green just like Loki.

3494
03:07:32,510 --> 03:07:35,050
On the technicality, we're in God of War.

3495
03:07:46,100 --> 03:07:48,240
What the fuck?

3496
03:07:54,660 --> 03:07:55,420
Don't worry.

3497
03:07:55,780 --> 03:07:57,280
He'll be so healthy.

3498
03:08:00,780 --> 03:08:02,500
I'm a little scared.

3499
03:08:06,480 --> 03:08:07,380
Don't worry.

3500
03:08:07,720 --> 03:08:08,360
Okay,

3501
03:08:12,830 --> 03:08:16,410
I'm not gonna have enough leaves here.

3502
03:08:21,100 --> 03:08:21,760
Alright, cool.

3503
03:08:24,020 --> 03:08:25,740
It would be funny if I actually hit that.

3504
03:08:26,560 --> 03:08:30,740
The fucking random ass sleep up top there.

3505
03:08:34,430 --> 03:08:35,190
Please.

3506
03:08:35,490 --> 03:08:36,110
Please.

3507
03:08:36,110 --> 03:08:38,370
I'm trying to give us as many leaves as possible.

3508
03:08:38,770 --> 03:08:40,150
But it's so hard.

3509
03:08:55,910 --> 03:08:56,650
Oh my god.

3510
03:08:57,270 --> 03:08:57,830
Please.

3511
03:09:00,310 --> 03:09:02,290
I'm trying so hard.

3512
03:09:02,770 --> 03:09:03,250
No!

3513
03:09:05,810 --> 03:09:07,370
Guys, I don't know...

3514
03:09:07,370 --> 03:09:09,290
Okay, I'm cocooning.

3515
03:09:09,950 --> 03:09:11,150
Oh, not legendary.

3516
03:09:11,150 --> 03:09:11,390
Not legendary.

3517
03:09:17,070 --> 03:09:18,230
No, are you serious?

3518
03:09:18,450 --> 03:09:19,130
Okay, that's fine.

3519
03:09:19,190 --> 03:09:19,690
We're all here.

3520
03:09:20,370 --> 03:09:21,870
We're all here.

3521
03:09:25,190 --> 03:09:25,630
Alright.

3522
03:09:29,890 --> 03:09:30,910
You know what?

3523
03:09:30,990 --> 03:09:31,510
Just kill me.

3524
03:09:31,690 --> 03:09:32,550
Just kill me.

3525
03:09:32,830 --> 03:09:34,830
Just kill me.

3526
03:09:35,030 --> 03:09:36,430
I'm getting a hard focus.

3527
03:09:37,330 --> 03:09:39,130
I don't know how to live.

3528
03:09:39,790 --> 03:09:40,690
I'm just...

3529
03:09:40,690 --> 03:09:42,350
I fucking have 12 kills.

3530
03:09:43,090 --> 03:09:45,650
They all just fucking max 8.

3531
03:09:46,830 --> 03:09:47,850
It's okay.

3532
03:09:47,990 --> 03:09:48,930
I'm focusing.

3533
03:09:49,130 --> 03:09:50,310
I'm so fucking focused.

3534
03:09:51,070 --> 03:09:51,770
I'll just play.

3535
03:09:52,490 --> 03:09:53,490
I'll play.

3536
03:09:54,470 --> 03:09:55,770
I'll play safer.

3537
03:09:56,090 --> 03:09:57,750
I'll play very less aggressive.

3538
03:09:58,490 --> 03:10:03,070
If I stay with everybody else, I can't possibly die.

3539
03:10:04,030 --> 03:10:07,550
If I just stay here.

3540
03:10:09,710 --> 03:10:10,810
There's no way.

3541
03:10:17,760 --> 03:10:18,280
Serious?

3542
03:10:20,360 --> 03:10:21,320
Alright, nice.

3543
03:10:24,140 --> 03:10:29,320
Alright, guys, you guys gotta stop letting him fucking do that to you guys.

3544
03:10:31,180 --> 03:10:35,940
Gotta stop letting him just walk up to us and just start swinging like that.

3545
03:10:36,820 --> 03:10:37,520
I don't know.

3546
03:10:38,040 --> 03:10:39,320
Or I'll just do that, I guess.

3547
03:10:39,320 --> 03:10:40,880
I guess.

3548
03:10:41,340 --> 03:10:43,160
Or I could just do that.

3549
03:10:43,400 --> 03:10:44,420
That works too.

3550
03:10:45,460 --> 03:10:48,600
That also works.

3551
03:10:55,400 --> 03:10:56,760
Damage boost.

3552
03:11:01,350 --> 03:11:03,030
Here's regen.

3553
03:11:11,390 --> 03:11:11,990
Regen.

3554
03:11:12,610 --> 03:11:13,770
Okay, there's a lot.

3555
03:11:13,890 --> 03:11:17,010
There's actually a lot of stuff going on.

3556
03:11:17,350 --> 03:11:19,770
Like, what's going on?

3557
03:11:20,130 --> 03:11:22,230
Oh my god, he's won.

3558
03:11:22,490 --> 03:11:23,650
He's actually won.

3559
03:11:23,670 --> 03:11:23,970
Please.

3560
03:11:26,330 --> 03:11:28,530
How did we...

3561
03:11:28,530 --> 03:11:29,790
Oh my god, we lived.

3562
03:11:31,670 --> 03:11:34,710
I think I clutched that for us, honestly.

3563
03:11:36,510 --> 03:11:37,910
Oh my god.

3564
03:11:40,850 --> 03:11:43,470
I think I actually clutched that.

3565
03:11:44,110 --> 03:11:49,630
I don't know what the fuck I was doing, but we did it.

3566
03:11:52,010 --> 03:11:55,010
I slept her and then I somehow killed her.

3567
03:11:55,910 --> 03:11:58,190
It was just pure reflex at this point.

3568
03:11:58,410 --> 03:12:00,150
I'm just gaming at this point.

3569
03:12:04,260 --> 03:12:06,240
Oh, he's walking up.

3570
03:12:13,320 --> 03:12:15,500
Oh my god.

3571
03:12:23,710 --> 03:12:26,570
I don't have enough heals.

3572
03:12:27,210 --> 03:12:30,130
Please, I really need you guys to live.

3573
03:12:36,720 --> 03:12:42,160
Oh my god, he has all magic 100% has all...

3574
03:12:42,160 --> 03:12:43,660
And I'm scared.

3575
03:12:48,240 --> 03:12:50,740
Oh my god.

3576
03:12:51,740 --> 03:12:56,400
We still have to fight this for another minute?

3577
03:13:00,140 --> 03:13:01,580
I don't have headshots.

3578
03:13:03,780 --> 03:13:05,840
I'm not hitting headshots.

3579
03:13:06,520 --> 03:13:08,120
Please calm down.

3580
03:13:09,220 --> 03:13:10,740
Play this slower, please.

3581
03:13:11,020 --> 03:13:12,660
I'm not hitting any headshots.

3582
03:13:19,440 --> 03:13:20,900
Oh, it's fine.

3583
03:13:21,000 --> 03:13:23,180
I'm completely...

3584
03:13:23,180 --> 03:13:24,800
I'm fine.

3585
03:13:34,720 --> 03:13:35,360
No!

3586
03:13:41,860 --> 03:13:42,500
No!

3587
03:13:42,900 --> 03:13:44,220
We didn't have the res.

3588
03:13:44,460 --> 03:13:46,080
Our guy died with res.

3589
03:13:47,720 --> 03:13:50,020
Oh my god, our guy died with res.

3590
03:13:50,800 --> 03:13:51,800
It's fine.

3591
03:13:52,300 --> 03:13:53,580
We're so healthy.

3592
03:13:53,580 --> 03:13:55,600
We're so healthy.

3593
03:14:04,970 --> 03:14:06,130
Oh no.

3594
03:14:07,090 --> 03:14:08,250
Oh, that's bad.

3595
03:14:09,270 --> 03:14:10,450
That's so bad.

3596
03:14:12,270 --> 03:14:13,650
That's so bad.

3597
03:14:14,030 --> 03:14:19,010
I saw it like in the corner of my eye and I tried to run.

3598
03:14:19,450 --> 03:14:25,890
He like slowly flew up and I was just like oh man, I don't think I'm gonna make it.

3599
03:14:26,190 --> 03:14:27,770
I don't think...

3600
03:14:32,360 --> 03:14:36,760
I saw it in the corner of my eye and I knew...

3601
03:14:44,760 --> 03:14:46,260
I'm running away.

3602
03:14:46,300 --> 03:14:46,900
I'm running away.

3603
03:14:46,960 --> 03:14:47,680
I'm running away.

3604
03:14:51,680 --> 03:14:53,720
I'm running away after that.

3605
03:14:55,520 --> 03:14:56,720
Oh my god.

3606
03:14:57,020 --> 03:14:57,420
Nice.

3607
03:14:58,540 --> 03:14:58,980
Yes!

3608
03:14:59,920 --> 03:15:01,040
Magic's dead!

3609
03:15:01,560 --> 03:15:03,100
Evil has been defeated!

3610
03:15:06,140 --> 03:15:07,100
Oh my god.

3611
03:15:07,100 --> 03:15:07,280
Oh man.

3612
03:15:08,300 --> 03:15:08,920
I'm Groot.

3613
03:15:09,600 --> 03:15:10,380
I am Groot.

3614
03:15:12,180 --> 03:15:13,420
Last 30 seconds.

3615
03:15:15,680 --> 03:15:17,360
Adam, you better live.

3616
03:15:18,060 --> 03:15:19,560
Adam, you have to live.

3617
03:15:23,540 --> 03:15:24,260
Adam.

3618
03:15:32,560 --> 03:15:35,860
Oh my god.

3619
03:15:38,500 --> 03:15:39,640
Oh my god.

3620
03:15:39,640 --> 03:15:39,800
Oh man.

3621
03:15:41,540 --> 03:15:42,000
No.

3622
03:15:45,080 --> 03:15:46,700
I'm going in.

3623
03:15:50,570 --> 03:15:51,810
Oh no.

3624
03:15:54,090 --> 03:15:55,010
No.

3625
03:15:56,930 --> 03:16:01,350
I lived for as long as...

3626
03:16:01,350 --> 03:16:02,550
Oh my god.

3627
03:16:03,730 --> 03:16:05,630
Adam and I are getting...

3628
03:16:05,630 --> 03:16:11,910
Adam and I are having the fucking roughest time right now.

3629
03:16:13,770 --> 03:16:15,210
Oh my god.

3630
03:16:15,290 --> 03:16:17,690
Oh my god.

3631
03:16:18,030 --> 03:16:18,130
Oh my god.

3632
03:16:18,130 --> 03:16:19,230
We're getting it.

3633
03:16:19,570 --> 03:16:20,430
Time's so hard.

3634
03:16:20,570 --> 03:16:22,870
Time's so hard in the back line.

3635
03:16:24,410 --> 03:16:24,910
I know.

3636
03:16:26,830 --> 03:16:28,150
Oh my god.

3637
03:16:28,790 --> 03:16:30,270
Oh my god.

3638
03:16:31,490 --> 03:16:32,270
I don't know.

3639
03:16:32,870 --> 03:16:35,090
Adam and I are just getting hard time.

3640
03:16:38,010 --> 03:16:38,830
It's not a tie.

3641
03:16:38,830 --> 03:16:40,090
100 can only be one winner.

3642
03:16:45,250 --> 03:16:46,210
No.

3643
03:16:46,930 --> 03:16:48,230
Guys, it's possible.

3644
03:16:49,930 --> 03:16:52,250
You just gotta believe.

3645
03:16:53,510 --> 03:16:56,210
Just keep believing.

3646
03:16:59,250 --> 03:17:01,670
The Starlord and I...

3647
03:17:01,670 --> 03:17:03,330
We need help.

3648
03:17:03,910 --> 03:17:05,550
We need help.

3649
03:17:06,030 --> 03:17:10,230
The Starlord and I are not having a good time in the back lines.

3650
03:17:11,170 --> 03:17:13,630
I don't even know what is killing me a lot.

3651
03:17:13,950 --> 03:17:17,490
I think it's the... Oh I think it's the Adam Warlock passive, right?

3652
03:17:17,730 --> 03:17:19,990
I have no idea how I'm dying so much.

3653
03:17:20,070 --> 03:17:22,450
I feel like...

3654
03:17:23,650 --> 03:17:24,610
Oh my god.

3655
03:17:24,790 --> 03:17:26,210
I don't think I'm like...

3656
03:17:26,210 --> 03:17:26,610
I don't know.

3657
03:17:27,350 --> 03:17:29,210
Maybe I'm mispositioning a lot.

3658
03:17:29,550 --> 03:17:31,410
I'll play more further back.

3659
03:17:35,200 --> 03:17:36,780
I could just be mispositioning.

3660
03:17:36,800 --> 03:17:37,660
Knowing me, it could be.

3661
03:17:37,660 --> 03:17:39,420
Yeah, that seems right.

3662
03:17:42,220 --> 03:17:45,800
I'm like a little worried that...

3663
03:17:45,800 --> 03:17:47,660
I'm trying to put two on cart.

3664
03:17:51,320 --> 03:17:51,960
Alright.

3665
03:17:56,900 --> 03:17:59,060
I don't really see them here.

3666
03:17:59,280 --> 03:18:06,080
I'm just shooting it for the sake of shooting stuff and hoping that I get something out of it.

3667
03:18:10,560 --> 03:18:11,440
Just kill her, kill her.

3668
03:18:11,480 --> 03:18:11,900
She has nothing.

3669
03:18:21,060 --> 03:18:22,220
Final 10 seconds.

3670
03:18:29,250 --> 03:18:30,210
Oh my god.

3671
03:18:38,330 --> 03:18:40,070
Come on, I'm so close to ult.

3672
03:18:44,500 --> 03:18:46,200
I have, I have, I have ult!

3673
03:18:51,800 --> 03:18:52,260
Nice!

3674
03:18:52,380 --> 03:18:53,380
They're making it for it.

3675
03:18:57,740 --> 03:18:58,200
Anyway.

3676
03:19:00,800 --> 03:19:01,620
What are you doing?

3677
03:19:02,260 --> 03:19:04,140
What are you doing over there just looking at us like that?

3678
03:19:04,980 --> 03:19:05,340
Huh?

3679
03:19:05,960 --> 03:19:07,740
What are you trying to do looking at us like that?

3680
03:19:11,120 --> 03:19:12,380
Oh my god.

3681
03:19:15,540 --> 03:19:16,780
Oh my god, he got someone.

3682
03:19:17,360 --> 03:19:18,040
Oh, he's dead.

3683
03:19:21,100 --> 03:19:25,240
I'm gonna back

3684
03:19:31,890 --> 03:19:32,410
up a little bit.

3685
03:19:33,570 --> 03:19:33,930
Yes!

3686
03:19:35,610 --> 03:19:37,050
Oh my god!

3687
03:19:37,050 --> 03:19:38,170
I can't save that!

3688
03:19:38,630 --> 03:19:40,970
I actually can't save that!

3689
03:19:41,310 --> 03:19:42,190
I'm sorry!

3690
03:19:42,690 --> 03:19:44,110
Holy shit!

3691
03:19:45,410 --> 03:19:48,790
That guy got crushed by a fucking rock!

3692
03:19:49,310 --> 03:19:50,310
Holy shit!

3693
03:19:52,770 --> 03:19:54,470
I'm just like, I'm sorry bro.

3694
03:19:54,970 --> 03:19:55,550
I...

3695
03:19:56,810 --> 03:19:58,930
My ult cannot...

3696
03:20:00,750 --> 03:20:05,930
My ult cannot fucking save that.

3697
03:20:07,130 --> 03:20:12,690
I know how much it would be amazing if it did but...

3698
03:20:13,810 --> 03:20:15,950
That shit is impossible.

3699
03:20:16,730 --> 03:20:18,630
That was a fucking rock.

3700
03:20:20,550 --> 03:20:21,410
That...

3701
03:20:24,110 --> 03:20:24,970
Okay.

3702
03:20:27,230 --> 03:20:27,910
Alright.

3703
03:20:30,250 --> 03:20:31,370
I'm fucking shooting.

3704
03:20:34,210 --> 03:20:35,830
Oh shit, what the fuck?

3705
03:20:37,910 --> 03:20:38,910
Oh shit!

3706
03:20:40,430 --> 03:20:42,010
I'm in, I'm in it, I'm in it.

3707
03:20:47,700 --> 03:20:48,340
Okay.

3708
03:20:55,030 --> 03:20:56,650
That's fucking right!

3709
03:20:57,930 --> 03:20:59,330
I am Groot!

3710
03:21:00,650 --> 03:21:01,590
Oh my god!

3711
03:21:01,670 --> 03:21:03,230
I looked at my chat.

3712
03:21:03,470 --> 03:21:04,210
He almost died.

3713
03:21:06,410 --> 03:21:06,970
I...

3714
03:21:06,970 --> 03:21:08,170
I turned around.

3715
03:21:08,310 --> 03:21:10,950
I wanna know what you guys thought when I did that.

3716
03:21:11,070 --> 03:21:14,590
Oh my god, it's literally like...

3717
03:21:14,590 --> 03:21:15,250
Come on.

3718
03:21:16,530 --> 03:21:17,090
Nope.

3719
03:21:17,390 --> 03:21:19,030
No dying for you guys.

3720
03:21:19,210 --> 03:21:21,430
I refuse to let you guys die.

3721
03:21:23,050 --> 03:21:23,530
Nope.

3722
03:21:24,730 --> 03:21:25,290
Nope.

3723
03:21:27,110 --> 03:21:27,670
Nope.

3724
03:21:33,620 --> 03:21:34,980
Get damage boost.

3725
03:21:34,980 --> 03:21:36,300
Oh my god.

3726
03:21:39,570 --> 03:21:40,650
We're okay.

3727
03:21:41,330 --> 03:21:42,790
We're so okay.

3728
03:21:43,730 --> 03:21:44,470
We're...

3729
03:21:44,470 --> 03:21:46,310
Where am I?

3730
03:21:46,850 --> 03:21:47,590
Where...

3731
03:21:50,290 --> 03:21:51,670
What's going on?

3732
03:21:52,230 --> 03:21:53,890
What's going on my screen?

3733
03:21:54,530 --> 03:21:55,990
Where am I?

3734
03:21:56,950 --> 03:21:57,990
Oh my god.

3735
03:21:58,310 --> 03:21:59,350
Oh my god.

3736
03:22:00,590 --> 03:22:02,070
Don't jump everybody.

3737
03:22:02,290 --> 03:22:03,170
Stay on the cart.

3738
03:22:03,170 --> 03:22:05,150
If you jump, you die.

3739
03:22:07,450 --> 03:22:08,770
I am Groot.

3740
03:22:09,970 --> 03:22:10,750
I am Groot.

3741
03:22:11,850 --> 03:22:12,850
Oh my god.

3742
03:22:13,390 --> 03:22:13,970
Oh my god.

3743
03:22:14,490 --> 03:22:15,430
There's no way.

3744
03:22:15,750 --> 03:22:18,730
There's no way.

3745
03:22:20,030 --> 03:22:22,610
There's no way I can push through this.

3746
03:22:23,110 --> 03:22:24,970
I refuse to believe.

3747
03:22:26,250 --> 03:22:27,830
In one minute.

3748
03:22:30,710 --> 03:22:32,670
Oh my god.

3749
03:22:32,770 --> 03:22:33,630
Oh my god.

3750
03:22:33,730 --> 03:22:35,450
Okay, but where we go until we lose?

3751
03:22:36,290 --> 03:22:41,690
We lose the next game.

3752
03:22:44,090 --> 03:22:44,650
Guys.

3753
03:22:44,870 --> 03:22:46,830
Okay, guys.

3754
03:22:48,030 --> 03:22:49,710
Think of it this way.

3755
03:22:50,470 --> 03:22:51,850
We go until we lose.

3756
03:22:52,110 --> 03:22:52,330
Guys.

3757
03:22:52,890 --> 03:22:55,090
We go until...

3758
03:22:55,090 --> 03:22:57,250
Max is like, it's time.

3759
03:23:03,210 --> 03:23:03,850
Guys.

3760
03:23:04,130 --> 03:23:05,930
We're on a hot win streak.

3761
03:23:06,170 --> 03:23:08,790
We can't end on a win streak.

3762
03:23:09,230 --> 03:23:09,530
Guys.

3763
03:23:10,050 --> 03:23:11,730
I promise you.

3764
03:23:11,830 --> 03:23:12,830
I promise you.

3765
03:23:14,170 --> 03:23:17,670
We will end when we lose.

3766
03:23:17,950 --> 03:23:18,130
Okay?

3767
03:23:18,250 --> 03:23:19,290
We haven't lost.

3768
03:23:19,790 --> 03:23:22,650
It's been like four to five games.

3769
03:23:22,650 --> 03:23:23,210
Guys, guys.

3770
03:23:23,290 --> 03:23:25,430
Four to five games.

3771
03:23:25,830 --> 03:23:26,290
Guys.

3772
03:23:26,950 --> 03:23:29,290
We gotta do it.

3773
03:23:29,470 --> 03:23:30,470
We gotta.

3774
03:23:33,270 --> 03:23:34,470
Oh my god.

3775
03:23:34,510 --> 03:23:35,550
What if we just hit eternity?

3776
03:23:36,090 --> 03:23:37,150
If we just never lost?

3777
03:23:37,510 --> 03:23:41,090
We hit this juicy win streak and we just never lose.

3778
03:23:41,210 --> 03:23:41,610
Guys.

3779
03:23:42,310 --> 03:23:43,630
Just think, guys.

3780
03:23:44,330 --> 03:23:44,830
I'm...

3781
03:23:49,930 --> 03:23:50,930
Just think.

3782
03:23:54,010 --> 03:23:55,550
I think our guy left.

3783
03:23:56,810 --> 03:23:57,710
I died.

3784
03:23:58,810 --> 03:24:01,090
Wait, I think this is a 4v4 now.

3785
03:24:02,330 --> 03:24:03,310
Wait a minute.

3786
03:24:04,890 --> 03:24:06,030
No, he's back.

3787
03:24:06,070 --> 03:24:06,430
He's back.

3788
03:24:06,510 --> 03:24:11,170
I was gonna be like, that would be very awkward if this is gonna be a 4v4 now.

3789
03:24:11,330 --> 03:24:12,090
5v5 now.

3790
03:24:19,180 --> 03:24:20,160
I think...

3791
03:24:20,160 --> 03:24:21,220
I think Groot's dead.

3792
03:24:21,720 --> 03:24:24,900
Yeah, Groot is not having it.

3793
03:24:31,050 --> 03:24:32,850
Oh my god, I almost killed him though.

3794
03:24:33,690 --> 03:24:34,910
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo.

3795
03:24:36,050 --> 03:24:36,670
Alright.

3796
03:24:39,260 --> 03:24:39,570
What?

3797
03:24:42,430 --> 03:24:43,050
Okay.

3798
03:24:43,570 --> 03:24:44,850
I'm not doing that again.

3799
03:24:46,210 --> 03:24:47,250
I learned.

3800
03:24:48,870 --> 03:24:49,970
I am Groot.

3801
03:24:51,110 --> 03:24:52,070
What the fuck?

3802
03:24:52,070 --> 03:24:53,430
He used a portal for...

3803
03:24:54,710 --> 03:24:56,070
Okay, I have a...

3804
03:24:57,070 --> 03:24:57,850
I'm Groot.

3805
03:25:00,170 --> 03:25:00,990
There we go.

3806
03:25:04,380 --> 03:25:05,160
Oh my god.

3807
03:25:05,200 --> 03:25:07,580
All these portals is fucking me up right now.

3808
03:25:10,020 --> 03:25:10,500
Okay.

3809
03:25:10,840 --> 03:25:11,640
That's fine.

3810
03:25:15,320 --> 03:25:16,020
That's fine.

3811
03:25:16,100 --> 03:25:16,600
That's not fine.

3812
03:25:23,120 --> 03:25:23,820
He's won.

3813
03:25:23,820 --> 03:25:24,580
He's won.

3814
03:25:24,680 --> 03:25:25,460
I'm born again.

3815
03:25:29,900 --> 03:25:31,080
We did it.

3816
03:25:31,580 --> 03:25:33,140
We did it, guys.

3817
03:25:33,880 --> 03:25:35,160
We fucking...

3818
03:25:35,820 --> 03:25:36,960
We were here.

3819
03:25:38,500 --> 03:25:41,540
I came back and still no God of War.

3820
03:25:44,660 --> 03:25:45,720
Guys, okay.

3821
03:25:46,220 --> 03:25:48,380
Okay, now we go until we lose, guys.

3822
03:25:48,680 --> 03:25:49,160
Okay?

3823
03:25:49,700 --> 03:25:50,020
Guys.

3824
03:25:52,540 --> 03:25:53,880
We've done it.

3825
03:25:54,440 --> 03:25:55,860
We've done it.

3826
03:25:56,440 --> 03:25:58,500
Chat, is it over?

3827
03:25:59,780 --> 03:26:00,780
Oh my god.

3828
03:26:00,820 --> 03:26:02,080
We got it back.

3829
03:26:02,700 --> 03:26:02,880
Yo.

3830
03:26:03,360 --> 03:26:04,800
We can't end.

3831
03:26:05,600 --> 03:26:08,620
We have a win streak though, Mac.

3832
03:26:09,220 --> 03:26:10,480
Do we really?

3833
03:26:11,780 --> 03:26:14,640
You really wanna call it there?

3834
03:26:23,240 --> 03:26:24,520
Holy shit.

3835
03:26:25,060 --> 03:26:27,520
The Q was like instant.

3836
03:26:27,860 --> 03:26:29,460
Oh shit, it's hot sick.

3837
03:26:30,060 --> 03:26:31,080
Oh my god.

3838
03:26:39,760 --> 03:26:43,300
Guys, the moment we lose, we'll go to God of War, guys.

3839
03:26:43,420 --> 03:26:46,380
The moment we lose, God of War.

3840
03:26:46,820 --> 03:26:47,880
I swear.

3841
03:26:48,900 --> 03:26:52,960
I swear, the moment we lose, God of War.

3842
03:26:58,510 --> 03:27:00,250
No, it doesn't make me a liar.

3843
03:27:00,690 --> 03:27:03,710
We just can't end on a fucking...

3844
03:27:04,590 --> 03:27:07,210
You're doing last time QNT, congratulations.

3845
03:27:07,550 --> 03:27:08,990
Wait, me?

3846
03:27:09,370 --> 03:27:10,530
Who's he talking to?

3847
03:27:11,070 --> 03:27:11,450
Me?

3848
03:27:13,870 --> 03:27:15,930
There's like three streamers here.

3849
03:27:16,070 --> 03:27:16,750
Who is it?

3850
03:27:20,970 --> 03:27:22,490
Who is it?

3851
03:27:22,590 --> 03:27:22,690
Who is it?

3852
03:27:22,690 --> 03:27:24,170
There's three streamers here.

3853
03:27:27,870 --> 03:27:28,510
Alright.

3854
03:27:29,370 --> 03:27:31,370
I mean, they're gonna ban Hella, right?

3855
03:27:32,070 --> 03:27:33,330
They must ban Hella.

3856
03:27:33,750 --> 03:27:34,570
Right, guys?

3857
03:27:35,910 --> 03:27:36,350
Right?

3858
03:27:37,290 --> 03:27:38,410
There's no one?

3859
03:27:38,550 --> 03:27:38,890
Alright.

3860
03:27:40,150 --> 03:27:41,830
What if I just ban...

3861
03:27:41,830 --> 03:27:42,510
Alright.

3862
03:27:45,510 --> 03:27:45,930
Alright.

3863
03:27:46,070 --> 03:27:47,230
Alright, we both got Hella, that's fine.

3864
03:27:49,330 --> 03:27:50,470
No, no, no.

3865
03:27:50,570 --> 03:27:51,490
I swear to God.

3866
03:27:51,610 --> 03:27:52,890
I swear to God, guys.

3867
03:27:53,550 --> 03:27:55,790
I like how...

3868
03:28:04,090 --> 03:28:05,390
We're on a...

3869
03:28:05,390 --> 03:28:07,390
We're on a win streak, Hyde.

3870
03:28:10,510 --> 03:28:12,010
Don't regret it.

3871
03:28:15,130 --> 03:28:16,090
Don't regret it.

3872
03:28:17,080 --> 03:28:17,870
He's lying.

3873
03:28:18,370 --> 03:28:23,610
I lost my rank up game four hours ago with him on Storm.

3874
03:28:37,390 --> 03:28:38,030
Yeah, I know.

3875
03:28:38,170 --> 03:28:40,210
It's just kind of crazy how it works.

3876
03:28:40,650 --> 03:28:41,530
Guys, guys.

3877
03:28:44,390 --> 03:28:46,110
Can I get another healer?

3878
03:28:48,730 --> 03:28:49,170
Guys.

3879
03:28:51,590 --> 03:28:53,430
I guess I can swap to it if no one else wants to.

3880
03:28:55,150 --> 03:28:56,610
It's a very good tank.

3881
03:28:59,450 --> 03:29:00,250
Oh, thanks, man.

3882
03:29:01,150 --> 03:29:03,450
I like how our other...

3883
03:29:03,450 --> 03:29:04,690
I'm just gonna heal bot.

3884
03:29:04,690 --> 03:29:07,450
Oh, I like how our other tank swapped.

3885
03:29:07,650 --> 03:29:13,630
I like how our other tank swapped healer.

3886
03:29:13,710 --> 03:29:15,210
Oh my God.

3887
03:29:16,410 --> 03:29:21,170
That's already like off to a very good start, guys.

3888
03:29:22,410 --> 03:29:24,690
The fact that the other...

3889
03:29:31,570 --> 03:29:32,990
Oh my God.

3890
03:29:33,150 --> 03:29:37,450
I don't know, guys.

3891
03:29:41,670 --> 03:29:43,190
Oh my God.

3892
03:29:54,550 --> 03:29:56,250
Oh my God.

3893
03:30:00,810 --> 03:30:01,930
Oh my God.

3894
03:30:02,010 --> 03:30:03,150
What do we do?

3895
03:30:08,850 --> 03:30:10,490
Oh my God.

3896
03:30:11,910 --> 03:30:13,550
How do we get out?

3897
03:30:17,030 --> 03:30:20,330
How do we get out?

3898
03:30:22,990 --> 03:30:25,110
Oh, please.

3899
03:30:25,670 --> 03:30:26,250
I can't.

3900
03:30:29,950 --> 03:30:30,790
Oh, please.

3901
03:30:31,030 --> 03:30:31,630
He's one.

3902
03:30:34,190 --> 03:30:34,750
Okay.

3903
03:30:35,840 --> 03:30:37,430
I'm zapping the fuck out of him.

3904
03:30:37,450 --> 03:30:37,770
Alright.

3905
03:30:41,330 --> 03:30:42,390
Alright.

3906
03:30:43,490 --> 03:30:44,550
Okay.

3907
03:30:47,840 --> 03:30:48,370
Alright.

3908
03:30:49,680 --> 03:30:51,190
I think...

3909
03:30:51,190 --> 03:30:52,570
I think I...

3910
03:30:53,840 --> 03:30:54,370
Alright.

3911
03:30:58,050 --> 03:30:59,110
Guys.

3912
03:31:00,690 --> 03:31:03,670
Did you really have to curse me again, guys?

3913
03:31:03,790 --> 03:31:04,410
Did you...

3914
03:31:04,410 --> 03:31:15,590
Did you really have to curse me again, guys?

3915
03:31:18,550 --> 03:31:19,750
We have...

3916
03:31:19,750 --> 03:31:23,750
3 DPS that are not willing to swap to support.

3917
03:31:24,110 --> 03:31:26,910
We could have had double tank, guys.

3918
03:31:33,170 --> 03:31:33,850
Guys.

3919
03:31:33,850 --> 03:31:36,810
It could have been double tank, guys.

3920
03:31:37,850 --> 03:31:38,230
You know what?

3921
03:31:38,410 --> 03:31:39,630
Fuck that guy in particular.

3922
03:31:40,210 --> 03:31:41,550
Fuck him in particular, though.

3923
03:31:52,950 --> 03:31:54,670
Oh my God.

3924
03:31:55,950 --> 03:31:57,970
Fuck that one guy in particular.

3925
03:32:00,370 --> 03:32:01,550
Oh my God.

3926
03:32:01,970 --> 03:32:04,490
He swapped to starlight.

3927
03:32:06,370 --> 03:32:07,530
I told you back!

3928
03:32:07,950 --> 03:32:09,310
Storm is shit!

3929
03:32:14,070 --> 03:32:16,530
But I don't want to go home.

3930
03:32:17,430 --> 03:32:20,130
I don't want to go home, though.

3931
03:32:20,610 --> 03:32:23,230
Guys, can you guys drop down to us?

3932
03:32:23,410 --> 03:32:23,810
Guys.

3933
03:32:24,110 --> 03:32:24,750
Guys.

3934
03:32:26,070 --> 03:32:27,550
Guys, we can't.

3935
03:32:27,910 --> 03:32:28,810
I'm scared.

3936
03:32:38,790 --> 03:32:38,990
Alright.

3937
03:32:43,590 --> 03:32:45,310
I heard something.

3938
03:32:48,550 --> 03:32:51,890
Alright, yeah.

3939
03:32:52,010 --> 03:32:53,630
Fuck your platform in particular.

3940
03:32:55,610 --> 03:32:56,630
Guys, please.

3941
03:32:57,410 --> 03:32:57,810
Guys.

3942
03:32:57,950 --> 03:33:07,070
Come on, wouldn't it be funny if I just have like this most insane win streak and then we just end eternity on stream?

3943
03:33:07,070 --> 03:33:10,310
Like, that would be so insane.

3944
03:33:10,910 --> 03:33:12,290
Like, honestly.

3945
03:33:12,950 --> 03:33:16,130
That would be like the craziest shit ever.

3946
03:33:16,770 --> 03:33:17,170
Guys.

3947
03:33:17,770 --> 03:33:20,410
That would be so fucking crazy.

3948
03:33:26,560 --> 03:33:28,420
Oh my God.

3949
03:33:29,300 --> 03:33:31,020
Oh my God, I dropped.

3950
03:33:31,020 --> 03:33:32,180
I'm gonna kill Panther.

3951
03:33:36,380 --> 03:33:39,260
Oh, fuck.

3952
03:33:39,460 --> 03:33:39,600
Okay.

3953
03:33:40,520 --> 03:33:40,900
Sorry.

3954
03:33:44,860 --> 03:33:45,380
That's fine.

3955
03:33:46,940 --> 03:33:48,740
I thought he said me first.

3956
03:33:58,770 --> 03:33:59,530
No!

3957
03:34:00,630 --> 03:34:01,110
No!

3958
03:34:11,520 --> 03:34:12,620
Okay, that's five.

3959
03:34:14,040 --> 03:34:15,620
That's fine, just beat him up.

3960
03:34:17,720 --> 03:34:18,860
So winnable, so winnable.

3961
03:34:24,620 --> 03:34:25,960
Come on, come on, come on.

3962
03:34:26,820 --> 03:34:28,540
Just live, just live, just live.

3963
03:34:40,160 --> 03:34:40,640
No!

3964
03:34:47,620 --> 03:34:48,780
Oh my God.

3965
03:34:51,600 --> 03:34:52,840
I thought he said...

3966
03:34:52,840 --> 03:34:53,840
Wait, didn't he say Luna first?

3967
03:34:54,400 --> 03:34:55,860
I thought you said Luna.

3968
03:35:20,420 --> 03:35:23,880
I was miscommunication.

3969
03:35:24,060 --> 03:35:28,140
I thought he said Luna first and I got so confused.

3970
03:35:28,360 --> 03:35:29,400
I was like, Luna first?

3971
03:35:29,460 --> 03:35:29,800
Okay.

3972
03:35:30,400 --> 03:35:31,720
It's usually Mantis.

3973
03:35:32,820 --> 03:35:33,760
Oh my God.

3974
03:35:33,760 --> 03:35:35,680
It's usually Mantis.

3975
03:35:35,800 --> 03:35:36,960
Why is Mantis always first?

3976
03:35:37,440 --> 03:35:41,400
Because you can use Mantis as an aggressor.

3977
03:35:44,160 --> 03:35:45,580
No, no, not yet.

3978
03:35:45,720 --> 03:35:46,260
Not yet.

3979
03:35:46,920 --> 03:35:50,100
Not yet, I'm still here.

3980
03:35:50,340 --> 03:35:51,620
I'm still here, guys.

3981
03:35:51,820 --> 03:35:52,380
Not yet.

3982
03:35:53,980 --> 03:35:54,860
Not yet.

3983
03:35:56,000 --> 03:35:58,320
Oh, he said target Luna first.

3984
03:35:58,940 --> 03:35:59,200
Oh!

3985
03:35:59,800 --> 03:36:00,320
Oh!

3986
03:36:01,700 --> 03:36:03,680
I thought he said Luna first.

3987
03:36:03,820 --> 03:36:04,940
That's why I was like, oh, me?

3988
03:36:09,500 --> 03:36:12,580
Oh, big dude.

3989
03:36:13,820 --> 03:36:16,620
You gotta stop bringing that half in, man.

3990
03:36:17,540 --> 03:36:17,860
Yeah.

3991
03:36:19,300 --> 03:36:20,620
You gotta stop that.

3992
03:36:20,860 --> 03:36:23,500
Oh my God.

3993
03:36:25,880 --> 03:36:27,060
I got my ult at least.

3994
03:36:27,060 --> 03:36:27,820
Yippee.

3995
03:36:30,940 --> 03:36:32,920
Put it on him first.

3996
03:36:38,230 --> 03:36:38,690
Oh God.

3997
03:36:38,970 --> 03:36:42,790
Oh my God.

3998
03:36:47,090 --> 03:36:47,750
Okay.

3999
03:36:55,100 --> 03:36:55,760
Okay.

4000
03:37:01,510 --> 03:37:03,070
Oh my God, where is everybody?

4001
03:37:04,870 --> 03:37:07,390
Oh my God, that's where everybody was.

4002
03:37:07,390 --> 03:37:09,270
I was like, where is everybody?

4003
03:37:15,300 --> 03:37:16,560
Okay, um...

4004
03:37:16,560 --> 03:37:21,120
Other than that, I... Oh my God, how many fucking ults were that?

4005
03:37:24,500 --> 03:37:28,980
Oh my God, that was... Where's our ults?

4006
03:37:30,980 --> 03:37:31,700
Where's...

4007
03:37:31,700 --> 03:37:34,240
Where was our ults for that?

4008
03:37:38,630 --> 03:37:39,070
Okay.

4009
03:37:39,510 --> 03:37:40,290
Alright, that's fine.

4010
03:37:40,290 --> 03:37:42,150
I don't need these staircases anyway.

4011
03:37:42,310 --> 03:37:43,870
Bro, that was like...

4012
03:37:46,590 --> 03:37:47,710
Please.

4013
03:37:50,730 --> 03:37:51,850
Alright.

4014
03:38:03,540 --> 03:38:04,100
Alright.

4015
03:38:13,760 --> 03:38:15,120
Hey guys.

4016
03:38:21,040 --> 03:38:24,480
We just let Benny set up 50 mines on the point.

4017
03:38:30,300 --> 03:38:32,180
It was even down.

4018
03:38:32,500 --> 03:38:33,580
Your curse is weird.

4019
03:38:36,660 --> 03:38:39,200
She just died and respawned.

4020
03:38:39,240 --> 03:38:40,260
She just put it down.

4021
03:38:40,280 --> 03:38:41,100
It's not set up.

4022
03:38:41,500 --> 03:38:43,020
I'm still GM1.

4023
03:38:43,560 --> 03:38:45,440
I'm still GM1.

4024
03:38:45,800 --> 03:38:46,920
Alright, alright.

4025
03:38:47,020 --> 03:38:47,900
I gotta play.

4026
03:38:47,900 --> 03:38:50,120
It gotta work now.

4027
03:38:50,640 --> 03:38:51,500
Jeez.

4028
03:38:54,440 --> 03:38:56,440
I promise.

4029
03:38:57,320 --> 03:38:59,660
I end on a loss.

4030
03:39:02,340 --> 03:39:04,800
Alright, before I...

4031
03:39:04,800 --> 03:39:07,200
Alright, guys.

4032
03:39:07,700 --> 03:39:09,380
Check Mac out, by the way.

4033
03:39:10,500 --> 03:39:11,500
Check...

4034
03:39:11,500 --> 03:39:12,160
Alright.

4035
03:39:12,160 --> 03:39:13,240
Alright.

4036
03:39:13,980 --> 03:39:14,860
God.

4037
03:39:15,600 --> 03:39:17,740
They cursed my last game.

4038
03:39:19,660 --> 03:39:22,160
If you're still on...

4039
03:39:23,760 --> 03:39:24,640
Afterwards...

4040
03:39:24,640 --> 03:39:25,040
We...

4041
03:39:25,040 --> 03:39:28,200
After I finish...

4042
03:39:28,200 --> 03:39:29,700
We go again.

4043
03:39:34,660 --> 03:39:35,540
Alright.

4044
03:39:36,080 --> 03:39:40,180
Now that I got GM1 back, you can unban everybody.

4045
03:39:40,180 --> 03:39:41,940
I'm okay now.

4046
03:39:42,160 --> 03:39:43,520
My crazy arc is...

4047
03:39:43,520 --> 03:39:45,000
My Minhera arc is done.

4048
03:39:45,520 --> 03:39:48,680
But show him some love.

4049
03:39:49,180 --> 03:39:51,560
Show him some love.

4050
03:39:54,740 --> 03:39:56,540
I told you!

4051
03:39:56,800 --> 03:39:58,800
I told you I keep my promises.

4052
03:39:58,980 --> 03:39:59,580
Look, I'm still...

4053
03:39:59,580 --> 03:40:00,560
I'm GM1 now.

4054
03:40:00,980 --> 03:40:03,060
I'm back to GM1.

4055
03:40:04,000 --> 03:40:04,720
Alright.

4056
03:40:05,860 --> 03:40:07,280
Alright, let's see.

4057
03:40:07,280 --> 03:40:09,280
Wait, how do I...

4058
03:40:09,800 --> 03:40:10,640
What is it?

4059
03:40:10,720 --> 03:40:12,020
We'll see if I'm up.

4060
03:40:12,380 --> 03:40:13,220
Alright, let's see.

4061
03:40:13,280 --> 03:40:14,320
How do I gift subs again?

4062
03:40:15,480 --> 03:40:17,380
Technically, we didn't do it in two games.

4063
03:40:17,460 --> 03:40:18,560
So he gets...

4064
03:40:18,560 --> 03:40:20,920
He does not get all the cut.

4065
03:40:21,240 --> 03:40:23,240
How the fuck do you gift subs?

4066
03:40:23,840 --> 03:40:24,700
Holy shit.

4067
03:40:24,820 --> 03:40:26,600
I have not done this before.

4068
03:40:27,200 --> 03:40:29,260
I have not done...

4069
03:40:29,260 --> 03:40:30,120
Oh, there we go.

4070
03:40:30,340 --> 03:40:30,620
Gift.

4071
03:40:31,560 --> 03:40:32,520
Bonus subs.

4072
03:40:32,640 --> 03:40:32,920
Okay.

4073
03:40:34,460 --> 03:40:34,940
Alright.

4074
03:40:34,940 --> 03:40:36,360
Alright.

4075
03:40:36,360 --> 03:40:37,640
He deserves it.

4076
03:40:37,760 --> 03:40:39,920
He fucking deserves it.

4077
03:40:40,020 --> 03:40:41,800
After everything I've been through.

4078
03:40:44,520 --> 03:40:47,260
Wait, what did he say?

4079
03:40:51,460 --> 03:40:54,880
He deserves it after...

4080
03:40:54,880 --> 03:40:56,540
Not a hundred though.

4081
03:40:57,480 --> 03:40:58,140
Not...

4082
03:41:01,200 --> 03:41:02,080
After...

4083
03:41:02,080 --> 03:41:03,780
Alright, not a hundred.

4084
03:41:04,800 --> 03:41:05,320
Not...

4085
03:41:05,320 --> 03:41:08,020
It was a lot longer.

4086
03:41:08,380 --> 03:41:09,380
Than two games.

4087
03:41:13,460 --> 03:41:13,980
Alright.

4088
03:41:15,440 --> 03:41:15,960
Alright.

4089
03:41:16,780 --> 03:41:18,380
I should have given him 20.

4090
03:41:18,640 --> 03:41:20,200
Just because he fucking...

4091
03:41:20,800 --> 03:41:23,300
I should have just given 20 for the storm pick.

4092
03:41:23,640 --> 03:41:24,960
Every deductible...

4093
03:41:24,960 --> 03:41:27,880
I should have just done all the deductibles for all the storm picks he did.

4094
03:41:28,200 --> 03:41:28,560
Alright.

4095
03:41:28,560 --> 03:41:29,380
Alright, mods.

4096
03:41:29,520 --> 03:41:32,240
I feel a lot more... I feel better now.

4097
03:41:32,420 --> 03:41:33,380
So like...

4098
03:41:33,380 --> 03:41:35,980
You can unban everybody that got banned.

4099
03:41:36,420 --> 03:41:36,980
Like...

4100
03:41:37,660 --> 03:41:39,740
I'm okay now, guys.

4101
03:41:39,880 --> 03:41:40,800
I'm not...

4102
03:41:40,800 --> 03:41:42,600
Now that I got my rank back.

4103
03:41:42,980 --> 03:41:44,420
You guys can like...

4104
03:41:44,420 --> 03:41:45,780
You can unban all of them.

4105
03:41:46,360 --> 03:41:47,520
I don't know if they can actually.

4106
03:41:47,640 --> 03:41:51,440
I feel like I have freedom for my voice.

4107
03:41:51,880 --> 03:41:54,140
The great unbanning.

4108
03:41:55,120 --> 03:41:58,100
All my mods that made the list was like...

4109
03:41:58,100 --> 03:41:58,700
Wait a minute.

4110
03:41:59,900 --> 03:42:02,440
What do you mean unban?

4111
03:42:04,800 --> 03:42:06,500
We can do that?

4112
03:42:06,780 --> 03:42:07,680
There, see guys?

4113
03:42:07,820 --> 03:42:08,940
I told you.

4114
03:42:09,240 --> 03:42:11,840
I told you I'd be back.

4115
03:42:12,080 --> 03:42:13,560
I wouldn't lie.

4116
03:42:13,680 --> 03:42:14,840
This isn't clickbait.

4117
03:42:15,460 --> 03:42:17,900
What do you mean unban?

4118
03:42:19,060 --> 03:42:22,000
You can crumple up the naughty list now.

4119
03:42:22,000 --> 03:42:22,420
I don't remember.

4120
03:42:22,500 --> 03:42:23,920
Did I play with mouse and keyboard?

4121
03:42:24,080 --> 03:42:24,840
Or with a controller?

4122
03:42:25,420 --> 03:42:28,200
I don't know how many...

4123
03:42:28,200 --> 03:42:30,460
How many of the new mods...

4124
03:42:36,500 --> 03:42:41,520
Guys, we could've been eternity.

4125
03:42:43,880 --> 03:42:45,660
Guys, we could've...

4126
03:42:45,660 --> 03:42:47,460
Why curse me?

4127
03:42:48,160 --> 03:42:50,320
We could've been eternity.

4128
03:42:56,380 --> 03:42:57,160
Alright.

4129
03:42:58,820 --> 03:43:00,220
Alright, guys.

4130
03:43:00,850 --> 03:43:03,560
Did I play with mouse and keyboard?

4131
03:43:04,080 --> 03:43:05,080
Or controller?

4132
03:43:05,280 --> 03:43:06,220
I don't remember.

4133
03:43:06,380 --> 03:43:07,800
It's been a long time.

4134
03:43:07,900 --> 03:43:10,520
It's actually been a long time.

4135
03:43:12,960 --> 03:43:15,200
It's been too long.

4136
03:43:17,600 --> 03:43:20,660
Did I play with controller and keyboard?

4137
03:43:20,940 --> 03:43:22,580
Guys, which one?

4138
03:43:22,580 --> 03:43:24,960
I remember controller.

4139
03:43:25,380 --> 03:43:26,560
Is it...

4140
03:43:26,560 --> 03:43:28,300
It's been so long.

4141
03:43:34,560 --> 03:43:36,120
It's been so long.

4142
03:43:36,240 --> 03:43:37,500
Was it actually a controller?

4143
03:43:38,820 --> 03:43:39,560
I don't remember.

4144
03:43:40,520 --> 03:43:41,400
I don't...

4145
03:43:41,400 --> 03:43:43,380
Guys, there has to be somebody that remembers.

4146
03:43:44,220 --> 03:43:45,880
Just pull up the VOD.

4147
03:43:48,120 --> 03:43:50,860
We can just pull up the VOD.

4148
03:43:50,860 --> 03:43:52,840
Guys, also I need to use the bathroom.

4149
03:43:53,020 --> 03:43:53,760
I'll be right back.

4150
03:45:04,970 --> 03:45:05,670
Alright, I'm back.

4151
03:45:06,090 --> 03:45:07,010
It was a controller?

4152
03:45:07,730 --> 03:45:09,050
Alright, give me a sec.

4153
03:45:09,130 --> 03:45:11,390
Let me get my controller then.

4154
03:45:12,090 --> 03:45:13,090
Oh my god.

4155
03:45:13,550 --> 03:45:15,150
What a fucking stream.

4156
03:45:15,550 --> 03:45:18,270
What a fucking stream.

4157
03:45:20,350 --> 03:45:21,610
Oh my god.

4158
03:45:21,690 --> 03:45:22,870
It was a journey.

4159
03:45:23,690 --> 03:45:25,710
It was truly a journey.

4160
03:45:25,890 --> 03:45:27,810
I can't believe we did it.

4161
03:45:27,810 --> 03:45:29,350
It just took...

4162
03:45:29,350 --> 03:45:31,590
I can't believe we fucking...

4163
03:45:31,590 --> 03:45:33,510
It just took me three hours.

4164
03:45:33,910 --> 03:45:35,110
No big deal.

4165
03:45:35,510 --> 03:45:38,050
You know, it's not a big deal.

4166
03:45:38,230 --> 03:45:41,470
Just three hours and forty minutes on my fucking life.

4167
03:45:42,310 --> 03:45:42,750
God.

4168
03:45:45,830 --> 03:45:48,590
Not that big of a deal, guys.

4169
03:45:48,790 --> 03:45:50,310
Not too bad.

4170
03:45:51,210 --> 03:45:53,590
Not that long if you think about it.

4171
03:45:54,290 --> 03:45:56,650
Where the fuck is my cable for this?

4172
03:45:57,450 --> 03:45:58,230
Oh no.

4173
03:45:59,830 --> 03:46:01,030
Oh no.

4174
03:46:01,530 --> 03:46:02,670
Oh no!

4175
03:46:04,850 --> 03:46:07,090
Guys, I need to get a cable real quick, guys.

4176
03:46:07,530 --> 03:46:08,890
Also, who the fuck did I mod?

4177
03:46:09,590 --> 03:46:11,310
Everything is up there.

4178
03:46:12,690 --> 03:46:15,890
That period was like a blackout period for me.

4179
03:46:15,970 --> 03:46:18,490
I don't even know half the things that happened there.

4180
03:46:18,850 --> 03:46:19,910
I'm not okay.

4181
03:46:21,850 --> 03:46:23,470
I'm grabbing my cable.

4182
03:46:32,430 --> 03:46:33,030
Okay.

4183
03:46:34,650 --> 03:46:35,250
Alright.

4184
03:46:35,550 --> 03:46:36,830
Like, how many did I...

4185
03:46:36,830 --> 03:46:38,350
It's like I just woke up.

4186
03:46:39,450 --> 03:46:40,050
Like...

4187
03:46:40,050 --> 03:46:44,670
I just woke up from a fucking trance there.

4188
03:46:44,950 --> 03:46:46,330
I'm like, what happened?

4189
03:46:47,070 --> 03:46:47,610
What happened?

4190
03:46:50,210 --> 03:46:52,290
Where are these new people in my chat?

4191
03:46:52,950 --> 03:46:53,830
What happened?

4192
03:46:59,310 --> 03:46:59,950
Alright.

4193
03:47:00,450 --> 03:47:01,090
Alright.

4194
03:47:02,270 --> 03:47:02,610
Okay.

4195
03:47:03,230 --> 03:47:04,810
Let's do this.

4196
03:47:04,950 --> 03:47:06,230
I don't remember how...

4197
03:47:06,230 --> 03:47:06,730
Okay, guys.

4198
03:47:06,790 --> 03:47:07,850
Now we're actually...

4199
03:47:07,850 --> 03:47:08,690
I told you.

4200
03:47:08,750 --> 03:47:10,270
I told you it wasn't alive.

4201
03:47:10,770 --> 03:47:12,230
Guys, I told you.

4202
03:47:12,230 --> 03:47:13,630
I told you, guys.

4203
03:47:14,950 --> 03:47:16,230
I told you we're in it.

4204
03:47:17,090 --> 03:47:18,550
Dad's coming back.

4205
03:47:18,630 --> 03:47:19,110
Guys.

4206
03:47:19,610 --> 03:47:21,110
Dad came back.

4207
03:47:21,570 --> 03:47:22,090
Like...

4208
03:47:23,230 --> 03:47:23,750
Like...

4209
03:47:23,750 --> 03:47:24,710
Alright.

4210
03:47:25,170 --> 03:47:26,690
What is my settings for...

4211
03:47:27,270 --> 03:47:27,790
Sorry.

4212
03:47:29,650 --> 03:47:32,030
Okay, I need to remember what my sound setting was.

4213
03:47:32,230 --> 03:47:33,750
Okay, 10.08.

4214
03:47:33,870 --> 03:47:34,210
Okay.

4215
03:47:35,210 --> 03:47:38,030
We have to redo all my settings for this.

4216
03:47:38,250 --> 03:47:39,930
Okay, 10.08.

4217
03:47:40,930 --> 03:47:41,990
There we go.

4218
03:47:43,430 --> 03:47:43,810
Alright.

4219
03:47:44,370 --> 03:47:45,250
Oh, my God.

4220
03:47:45,430 --> 03:47:47,030
It's been so long, Dad.

4221
03:47:48,050 --> 03:47:48,870
Oh, my God.

4222
03:47:48,870 --> 03:47:49,850
It's been...

4223
03:47:49,850 --> 03:47:51,430
My controller's not working, guys.

4224
03:47:51,570 --> 03:47:54,050
My controller's not working.

4225
03:47:56,730 --> 03:47:57,870
Wait a minute.

4226
03:47:58,670 --> 03:48:00,830
Why isn't my controller working?

4227
03:48:01,570 --> 03:48:02,550
Wait a minute.

4228
03:48:02,710 --> 03:48:03,610
Okay, maybe I need...

4229
03:48:03,610 --> 03:48:05,730
Wait a minute.

4230
03:48:05,790 --> 03:48:06,950
This isn't Marvel Rivals.

4231
03:48:07,230 --> 03:48:10,670
Maybe it's the PlayStation controller.

4232
03:48:10,810 --> 03:48:11,770
Is it the PlayStation controller?

4233
03:48:12,450 --> 03:48:13,710
Or is it the...

4234
03:48:13,710 --> 03:48:14,410
Let's see.

4235
03:48:15,770 --> 03:48:17,650
Okay, yeah, it was the PlayStation controller.

4236
03:48:17,790 --> 03:48:18,130
Alright.

4237
03:48:18,610 --> 03:48:20,270
What the fuck was I doing?

4238
03:48:20,370 --> 03:48:22,230
Are you sure I was playing on a controller?

4239
03:48:23,870 --> 03:48:24,590
Are you guys sure?

4240
03:48:25,450 --> 03:48:26,330
Feels weird.

4241
03:48:27,930 --> 03:48:28,810
No way.

4242
03:48:29,010 --> 03:48:30,050
Was I actually...

4243
03:48:30,050 --> 03:48:30,890
Where am I?

4244
03:48:31,150 --> 03:48:32,150
Oh, shit.

4245
03:48:32,630 --> 03:48:33,730
How do I play this game?

4246
03:48:36,290 --> 03:48:38,130
I remember I talked to the guy.

4247
03:48:38,270 --> 03:48:39,190
I have his head.

4248
03:48:39,730 --> 03:48:40,030
Okay.

4249
03:48:40,030 --> 03:48:41,010
Okay.

4250
03:48:42,230 --> 03:48:43,270
Alright, so...

4251
03:48:43,870 --> 03:48:45,670
And then...

4252
03:48:45,670 --> 03:48:46,190
Really?

4253
03:48:47,890 --> 03:48:49,070
Oh my god.

4254
03:48:49,470 --> 03:48:50,410
Okay, I'm trying to remember.

4255
03:48:50,510 --> 03:48:53,530
I like to do that and then...

4256
03:48:53,530 --> 03:48:54,570
And then that.

4257
03:48:54,790 --> 03:48:55,970
And that's how I melee.

4258
03:48:56,550 --> 03:48:57,850
Alright, where do I go?

4259
03:48:58,770 --> 03:49:00,090
I took his head.

4260
03:49:00,630 --> 03:49:00,930
Alright.

4261
03:49:02,090 --> 03:49:04,830
Last time we were here, we took this guy's head.

4262
03:49:05,110 --> 03:49:06,410
Because we were going to bring him somewhere.

4263
03:49:06,410 --> 03:49:08,850
Now where the fuck do I go, boy?

4264
03:49:10,550 --> 03:49:11,790
Check my skills.

4265
03:49:11,890 --> 03:49:13,110
Do I have enough skills?

4266
03:49:15,070 --> 03:49:15,770
I'm tired.

4267
03:49:17,490 --> 03:49:18,810
I'm joking.

4268
03:49:19,390 --> 03:49:20,830
I'm joking.

4269
03:49:21,750 --> 03:49:23,050
I'm joking, guys.

4270
03:49:23,050 --> 03:49:23,530
I'm joking, guys.

4271
03:49:23,710 --> 03:49:24,390
I'm...

4272
03:49:24,390 --> 03:49:25,790
I'm...

4273
03:49:29,030 --> 03:49:30,310
We're gonna...

4274
03:49:30,310 --> 03:49:31,930
We're gonna do it.

4275
03:49:32,010 --> 03:49:33,530
Okay, magic combo.

4276
03:49:34,650 --> 03:49:35,450
Light arrows.

4277
03:49:35,650 --> 03:49:36,670
Oh, wait.

4278
03:49:36,830 --> 03:49:37,810
That's so cool.

4279
03:49:38,090 --> 03:49:39,050
Okay, let's just buy everything.

4280
03:49:39,470 --> 03:49:40,050
Fuck it.

4281
03:49:40,110 --> 03:49:40,370
Oh, wait.

4282
03:49:40,410 --> 03:49:41,810
What should I get, actually?

4283
03:49:44,090 --> 03:49:45,670
I just did 10 minutes.

4284
03:49:45,850 --> 03:49:47,310
I just booted up.

4285
03:49:47,410 --> 03:49:49,490
I was like, alright, that's enough God of War for today.

4286
03:49:49,930 --> 03:49:51,470
Alright, I'll see you guys next week.

4287
03:49:51,650 --> 03:49:55,870
I'll see you guys next week.

4288
03:49:56,250 --> 03:49:57,410
Alright, which one do I get?

4289
03:49:57,550 --> 03:50:00,010
Do I get...

4290
03:50:00,010 --> 03:50:00,730
Light potency.

4291
03:50:00,730 --> 03:50:02,550
We can use light arrows.

4292
03:50:02,670 --> 03:50:03,950
Increase weaken status.

4293
03:50:04,330 --> 03:50:06,730
Oh, why did I upgrade this?

4294
03:50:07,150 --> 03:50:08,790
This looked like it was worthless.

4295
03:50:10,690 --> 03:50:13,210
Is there anything I should get on here?

4296
03:50:14,050 --> 03:50:15,070
The betrayal.

4297
03:50:15,490 --> 03:50:15,850
You!

4298
03:50:16,570 --> 03:50:18,610
I miss Marble Rivals.

4299
03:50:22,830 --> 03:50:24,730
We could be playing...

4300
03:50:24,730 --> 03:50:26,490
Doki, we could be playing...

4301
03:50:26,490 --> 03:50:27,870
Marble Rivals right now.

4302
03:50:27,870 --> 03:50:29,750
We could be playing...

4303
03:50:29,750 --> 03:50:30,390
Marble Rivals.

4304
03:50:34,130 --> 03:50:35,170
Oh, shit!

4305
03:50:35,770 --> 03:50:37,030
Wait, that looks cool.

4306
03:50:37,230 --> 03:50:38,050
I want this.

4307
03:50:38,870 --> 03:50:39,510
Come on, Doki.

4308
03:50:39,590 --> 03:50:40,590
Just one more match.

4309
03:50:41,270 --> 03:50:42,830
You know you want to.

4310
03:50:43,490 --> 03:50:44,870
Oh, wait, I can get...

4311
03:50:44,870 --> 03:50:47,170
3 targets at once?

4312
03:50:47,290 --> 03:50:48,250
Oh my God.

4313
03:50:48,710 --> 03:50:50,130
I can run?

4314
03:50:50,870 --> 03:50:53,650
I don't feel like I run a lot.

4315
03:50:55,010 --> 03:50:57,990
What is this?

4316
03:50:58,510 --> 03:50:59,790
Heavy attack to...

4317
03:50:59,790 --> 03:51:00,510
Okay, you know what?

4318
03:51:00,550 --> 03:51:02,670
I don't know if I'm actually going to do it, but fuck it.

4319
03:51:02,950 --> 03:51:03,330
You know?

4320
03:51:05,370 --> 03:51:07,290
Maybe I'll accidentally do this.

4321
03:51:07,370 --> 03:51:08,350
When I button mash.

4322
03:51:08,970 --> 03:51:09,350
You know?

4323
03:51:09,530 --> 03:51:13,050
I'm just thinking like, oh, maybe accidentally I do it.

4324
03:51:13,170 --> 03:51:14,290
Which is fine by me.

4325
03:51:14,610 --> 03:51:15,510
Do I have a better one?

4326
03:51:15,550 --> 03:51:16,190
Oh, I do.

4327
03:51:16,430 --> 03:51:17,370
It's gold now.

4328
03:51:18,290 --> 03:51:18,730
Nice.

4329
03:51:19,810 --> 03:51:21,650
Alright, I'm gold now.

4330
03:51:21,650 --> 03:51:22,470
Oh my God, there he is.

4331
03:51:22,490 --> 03:51:23,130
There's his head.

4332
03:51:23,430 --> 03:51:24,350
Oh, what's this?

4333
03:51:26,430 --> 03:51:27,770
We're going to...

4334
03:51:28,910 --> 03:51:29,370
Neonon.

4335
03:51:32,290 --> 03:51:32,930
We go this way?

4336
03:51:34,430 --> 03:51:35,510
Alright, we go this way.

4337
03:51:36,590 --> 03:51:36,930
Alright.

4338
03:51:37,850 --> 03:51:39,770
No, wait, I came from here, didn't I?

4339
03:51:40,630 --> 03:51:42,230
Boy, where do I go, boy?

4340
03:51:43,270 --> 03:51:43,730
Boy!

4341
03:51:44,630 --> 03:51:45,730
Where do I go?

4342
03:51:45,990 --> 03:51:47,690
I'm fucking lost, boy.

4343
03:51:49,430 --> 03:51:49,870
Boy.

4344
03:51:49,910 --> 03:51:51,470
It has to be downstairs, right?

4345
03:51:51,630 --> 03:51:53,970
Yeah, he's looking downstairs, so he knows what's up.

4346
03:51:57,390 --> 03:51:58,890
Alright, this has to be it.

4347
03:52:02,440 --> 03:52:02,880
Boy!

4348
03:52:05,460 --> 03:52:06,380
It's over there.

4349
03:52:08,420 --> 03:52:09,440
Yeah, that's where she lives.

4350
03:52:09,540 --> 03:52:11,020
Oh, I remember the witch house!

4351
03:52:12,080 --> 03:52:16,020
That's when boy fucking asked me about, like, why he feels funny.

4352
03:52:19,820 --> 03:52:20,260
Oh!

4353
03:52:21,400 --> 03:52:22,060
What's that?

4354
03:52:23,800 --> 03:52:24,460
What's that?

4355
03:52:24,560 --> 03:52:25,400
Oh, what?

4356
03:52:26,880 --> 03:52:28,080
Oh, to show it?

4357
03:52:29,360 --> 03:52:30,660
Oh, this is the gateway.

4358
03:52:31,580 --> 03:52:32,840
Can I go to the witch house?

4359
03:52:41,400 --> 03:52:43,600
You had a crush on the witch, don't you remember?

4360
03:52:43,800 --> 03:52:45,240
Look, I remember that part.

4361
03:52:45,520 --> 03:52:48,960
He was like, oh my God, I'll do anything for you.

4362
03:52:48,960 --> 03:52:52,620
And then the witch was like, I'm like a thousand plus years old, boy.

4363
03:52:53,360 --> 03:52:55,380
Can we move the God of War stream next week?

4364
03:52:55,480 --> 03:52:59,300
I have to play Marvel Rivals and I can't watch the stream.

4365
03:53:00,740 --> 03:53:01,780
Pretty please.

4366
03:53:02,960 --> 03:53:05,500
GoldenFoxy, thank you for the super chat.

4367
03:53:05,780 --> 03:53:06,780
Thank you, thank you.

4368
03:53:07,080 --> 03:53:10,720
For the people who are like, I'm gonna fuck you up.

4369
03:53:11,680 --> 03:53:12,300
Wait, where is it?

4370
03:53:12,300 --> 03:53:13,060
It has to be here.

4371
03:53:13,640 --> 03:53:14,620
That's where she lives.

4372
03:53:16,380 --> 03:53:16,640
Eh?

4373
03:53:16,640 --> 03:53:18,360
Do I not have any gateways there?

4374
03:53:18,560 --> 03:53:19,540
Oh, there she is!

4375
03:53:19,660 --> 03:53:20,660
That's where she lives.

4376
03:53:21,080 --> 03:53:23,560
Okay, before I head there, I want to double check.

4377
03:53:24,620 --> 03:53:26,080
If there's anything else here.

4378
03:53:26,180 --> 03:53:26,420
Nope.

4379
03:53:27,260 --> 03:53:28,320
Alright, let's go, boy.

4380
03:53:29,560 --> 03:53:30,000
Let's go.

4381
03:53:30,140 --> 03:53:31,960
Time to head to your very first crush.

4382
03:53:33,600 --> 03:53:34,080
Hey!

4383
03:53:34,320 --> 03:53:37,360
Everyone has like their first crush.

4384
03:53:44,130 --> 03:53:44,610
Uh...

4385
03:53:44,610 --> 03:53:45,750
Get me there.

4386
03:53:46,430 --> 03:53:47,070
Get me there.

4387
03:53:47,070 --> 03:53:48,970
I can't get there?

4388
03:53:51,760 --> 03:53:53,300
Do I have to go from here?

4389
03:53:55,420 --> 03:53:56,280
Wait a minute.

4390
03:53:56,380 --> 03:53:57,300
How do I get there?

4391
03:53:58,100 --> 03:53:58,480
Boy!

4392
03:53:59,440 --> 03:54:00,640
Where did boy go?

4393
03:54:01,460 --> 03:54:01,820
Boy?

4394
03:54:05,040 --> 03:54:05,600
Oh!

4395
03:54:08,220 --> 03:54:10,380
Oh, I have to go to the...

4396
03:54:11,400 --> 03:54:12,500
From the center.

4397
03:54:12,680 --> 03:54:12,960
Okay.

4398
03:54:13,200 --> 03:54:15,380
Wait, this isn't Marvel Rivals.

4399
03:54:16,220 --> 03:54:17,320
That's bad.

4400
03:54:18,580 --> 03:54:20,120
It said I play.

4401
03:54:20,300 --> 03:54:21,220
Guys, please.

4402
03:54:24,020 --> 03:54:24,620
Oh!

4403
03:54:26,660 --> 03:54:27,560
Jump in.

4404
03:54:29,000 --> 03:54:29,540
Come on, boy.

4405
03:54:30,000 --> 03:54:31,600
You want to jump in, don't ya?

4406
03:54:32,140 --> 03:54:33,220
It's so inviting.

4407
03:54:40,140 --> 03:54:42,660
Oh my god, it's been 20 years.

4408
03:54:45,520 --> 03:54:46,920
His nephews?

4409
03:54:49,900 --> 03:54:51,320
Who are his nephews?

4410
03:54:52,640 --> 03:54:54,540
I thought like they have kids?

4411
03:55:00,560 --> 03:55:05,380
I just know that Loki's children he like fucked a lot of monsters.

4412
03:55:05,980 --> 03:55:11,620
Like he had the horse, the snake and like the... what is it?

4413
03:55:12,280 --> 03:55:14,340
Like Basically Satan?

4414
03:55:18,280 --> 03:55:20,380
I just know that Loki's kids...

4415
03:55:20,380 --> 03:55:20,520
Oh!

4416
03:55:22,340 --> 03:55:22,760
Alright.

4417
03:55:23,920 --> 03:55:24,600
In we go.

4418
03:55:25,400 --> 03:55:26,060
Oh no, no.

4419
03:55:26,120 --> 03:55:26,780
He got fucked.

4420
03:55:26,900 --> 03:55:27,700
Not the other way around.

4421
03:55:27,740 --> 03:55:27,960
Sorry.

4422
03:55:28,860 --> 03:55:30,200
Loki's definitely a bottom.

4423
03:55:32,620 --> 03:55:33,460
Oh, it was hell.

4424
03:55:33,500 --> 03:55:34,040
Oh my god.

4425
03:55:34,240 --> 03:55:36,480
Fucking Marvel Rivals brain rot right now.

4426
03:55:36,800 --> 03:55:38,320
I was like, silly you.

4427
03:55:38,680 --> 03:55:39,080
Hell yes.

4428
03:55:39,120 --> 03:55:40,240
Hell yes, they're sister.

4429
03:55:40,240 --> 03:55:43,300
But I forgot the original Norse mythology.

4430
03:55:43,460 --> 03:55:45,040
Hell yes, actually Loki's daughter.

4431
03:55:53,680 --> 03:55:55,560
Oh my god, are you gonna share?

4432
03:55:57,140 --> 03:55:58,540
Guys, I didn't eat lunch.

4433
03:56:00,680 --> 03:56:01,720
Guys, I...

4434
03:56:01,720 --> 03:56:02,760
Guys...

4435
03:56:02,760 --> 03:56:05,240
After this, I'm gonna get something to eat.

4436
03:56:15,400 --> 03:56:17,200
The nipples stay out.

4437
03:56:19,000 --> 03:56:20,760
Like, how is that protecting me?

4438
03:56:20,840 --> 03:56:23,260
Why would I protect my arse but not my fucking nipples?

4439
03:56:28,080 --> 03:56:29,220
Like, I can just...

4440
03:56:29,220 --> 03:56:30,700
It's literally like in the center.

4441
03:56:30,960 --> 03:56:31,800
I can shoot...

4442
03:56:31,800 --> 03:56:34,420
If I had a gun, I'd just...

4443
03:56:37,940 --> 03:56:39,540
Then why wear armor?

4444
03:56:42,020 --> 03:56:44,580
Why would anyone attack bear?

4445
03:56:46,400 --> 03:56:48,540
Oh no, it's at the center mass?

4446
03:56:51,380 --> 03:56:51,980
Alright.

4447
03:56:53,080 --> 03:56:55,060
Oh, I got a bow upgrade?

4448
03:56:57,580 --> 03:56:58,200
Where is it?

4449
03:56:59,320 --> 03:57:00,660
It just says waist armor.

4450
03:57:04,580 --> 03:57:06,140
Okay, what do I...

4451
03:57:06,140 --> 03:57:13,180
Okay, if I upgrade the boy, then like I don't have to ever increase arrow capacity.

4452
03:57:13,440 --> 03:57:19,360
Oh, we upgrade the bow so that I don't have to do anything.

4453
03:57:22,360 --> 03:57:25,260
And I guess I could upgrade...

4454
03:57:25,260 --> 03:57:28,100
Yeah, upgrade the boy so I don't have to work anymore.

4455
03:57:28,740 --> 03:57:29,980
I'm gonna live through my boy.

4456
03:57:32,940 --> 03:57:34,340
I'll live through you.

4457
03:57:36,000 --> 03:57:36,820
Low perk.

4458
03:57:37,740 --> 03:57:38,640
That's the way.

4459
03:57:38,920 --> 03:57:41,440
Yeah, 100% the boy will do everything for me.

4460
03:57:41,660 --> 03:57:44,520
That's why when I retire, he'll take care of me, right?

4461
03:57:44,600 --> 03:57:46,000
He's not gonna put me in a home.

4462
03:57:46,500 --> 03:57:51,700
Guys, even though it took me two months to come back to you, you won't put me in a home, boy.

4463
03:57:52,160 --> 03:57:55,300
I take care of... Look at me, I treat you so well.

4464
03:58:02,740 --> 03:58:03,380
Alright.

4465
03:58:03,380 --> 03:58:03,380
Alright.

4466
03:58:04,100 --> 03:58:05,460
Door open.

4467
03:58:06,280 --> 03:58:07,840
Okay, there's the tree.

4468
03:58:09,560 --> 03:58:12,960
Does this take me to where I need to go?

4469
03:58:15,200 --> 03:58:16,360
I don't...

4470
03:58:16,360 --> 03:58:21,620
I don't remember if I have to go through the tree or... Oh, wrong way.

4471
03:58:21,780 --> 03:58:22,040
Alright.

4472
03:58:23,460 --> 03:58:24,300
Open Sesame.

4473
03:58:24,840 --> 03:58:25,840
Oh, Chad is dead?

4474
03:58:26,700 --> 03:58:29,500
Ever since we left Marble Rivals, it's never been the same.

4475
03:58:32,320 --> 03:58:35,480
Chad is still living in the Marble Rivals world.

4476
03:58:38,080 --> 03:58:40,820
They're still living in the goddamn past.

4477
03:58:41,960 --> 03:58:43,480
Alright, that should fix it.

4478
03:58:43,740 --> 03:58:44,860
It didn't fix it.

4479
03:58:46,020 --> 03:58:47,660
Sorry, it didn't fix it.

4480
03:58:49,340 --> 03:58:49,900
Man.

4481
03:58:50,420 --> 03:58:50,900
Okay.

4482
03:58:53,140 --> 03:58:54,100
And then...

4483
03:58:54,900 --> 03:58:55,380
Hello?

4484
03:58:57,780 --> 03:58:58,260
Hello?

4485
03:58:59,660 --> 03:59:00,680
Where are you?

4486
03:59:01,580 --> 03:59:02,660
Oh, there you go.

4487
03:59:02,820 --> 03:59:03,580
That fixed it.

4488
03:59:04,740 --> 03:59:06,160
Alright, which way, guys?

4489
03:59:06,320 --> 03:59:07,580
I'm directionless right now.

4490
03:59:07,620 --> 03:59:08,540
Oh, maybe this way.

4491
03:59:08,700 --> 03:59:09,540
It has to be this way.

4492
03:59:11,740 --> 03:59:13,160
Alright, open Sesame.

4493
03:59:14,160 --> 03:59:16,080
How do I make the boy work again?

4494
03:59:20,340 --> 03:59:21,760
Where do I go, boy?

4495
03:59:25,010 --> 03:59:26,150
Where do we go?

4496
03:59:26,470 --> 03:59:27,810
How do I make the boy work?

4497
03:59:27,970 --> 03:59:31,110
He's gotta work for his stay.

4498
03:59:31,610 --> 03:59:32,650
He's gotta learn.

4499
03:59:44,280 --> 03:59:45,500
Oh, that way!

4500
03:59:45,640 --> 03:59:45,960
Okay.

4501
03:59:47,660 --> 03:59:48,640
I was like, what?

4502
03:59:49,900 --> 03:59:50,660
Where's door?

4503
03:59:59,960 --> 04:00:00,500
Oh.

4504
04:00:02,840 --> 04:00:04,040
Oh, what's over there?

4505
04:00:07,180 --> 04:00:09,780
Like, the rabbit and the hare existed in this world?

4506
04:00:11,280 --> 04:00:12,120
Oh, nice.

4507
04:00:12,200 --> 04:00:13,140
Good thing he's dead.

4508
04:00:14,760 --> 04:00:15,580
Oh, nice.

4509
04:00:15,620 --> 04:00:16,560
It's gotta work now.

4510
04:00:17,000 --> 04:00:18,880
Oh my god, is that Thor?

4511
04:00:19,240 --> 04:00:20,320
From Marvel Rivals?

4512
04:00:23,940 --> 04:00:24,400
Oh my god.

4513
04:00:24,400 --> 04:00:25,380
I told you, guys.

4514
04:00:25,980 --> 04:00:28,120
I told you it was Marvel Rivals.

4515
04:00:28,420 --> 04:00:30,320
I told you it was God of War.

4516
04:00:31,780 --> 04:00:34,220
If I'm not supposed to go there, where am I supposed to...

4517
04:00:34,220 --> 04:00:35,380
That has to be Thor.

4518
04:00:42,180 --> 04:00:46,720
Is there like a secret?

4519
04:00:46,760 --> 04:00:48,580
Oh my god, there was a secret.

4520
04:00:50,320 --> 04:00:50,920
A secret hole.

4521
04:00:51,600 --> 04:00:52,580
Toki, please.

4522
04:00:53,600 --> 04:00:54,700
Toki, please.

4523
04:00:55,160 --> 04:00:56,980
We're in God of War now.

4524
04:00:58,940 --> 04:01:01,340
It's time to stop.

4525
04:01:04,420 --> 04:01:06,100
Alright, let's see.

4526
04:01:07,040 --> 04:01:08,500
So we go this way.

4527
04:01:09,300 --> 04:01:12,040
It's nice to have, like, my personal navigator.

4528
04:01:13,840 --> 04:01:15,800
I don't need to ask for directions.

4529
04:01:17,460 --> 04:01:18,960
Alright, here we go.

4530
04:01:18,960 --> 04:01:20,380
And we go this way.

4531
04:01:22,520 --> 04:01:23,940
Secret tunnel.

4532
04:01:24,500 --> 04:01:26,440
This is a very long secret tunnel.

4533
04:01:29,240 --> 04:01:33,120
It's been zero days since she last mentioned Marvel Rivals.

4534
04:01:37,320 --> 04:01:40,160
Oh, nice.

4535
04:01:42,260 --> 04:01:42,660
Alright.

4536
04:01:43,360 --> 04:01:47,140
Those Nord people really copying Marvel Rivals making Thor?

4537
04:01:47,140 --> 04:01:49,060
Oh my god.

4538
04:01:52,660 --> 04:01:53,620
I forgot.

4539
04:01:53,940 --> 04:01:54,820
How did you...

4540
04:01:54,820 --> 04:01:56,920
Boy, how did you...

4541
04:01:56,920 --> 04:01:58,320
How do we do this, boy?

4542
04:02:00,080 --> 04:02:00,560
Boy.

4543
04:02:02,660 --> 04:02:03,980
Boy, I don't remember.

4544
04:02:04,180 --> 04:02:06,400
Boy, what are the controls, boy?

4545
04:02:08,040 --> 04:02:09,240
Okay, not that.

4546
04:02:09,880 --> 04:02:11,440
Oh, yeah, that was it.

4547
04:02:11,800 --> 04:02:12,200
Alright.

4548
04:02:13,320 --> 04:02:14,580
Those were the controls.

4549
04:02:14,700 --> 04:02:15,320
Thank you, boy.

4550
04:02:17,900 --> 04:02:19,380
Thank god you're useful.

4551
04:02:21,320 --> 04:02:22,900
Good thing you're useful, boy.

4552
04:02:23,260 --> 04:02:26,380
Or you wouldn't be able to sleep in bed tonight.

4553
04:02:26,540 --> 04:02:27,600
You'll have to sleep on the floor.

4554
04:02:28,840 --> 04:02:29,640
I'm a good parent.

4555
04:02:30,340 --> 04:02:30,740
Bye.

4556
04:02:31,160 --> 04:02:32,200
Wait, where did he go?

4557
04:02:32,360 --> 04:02:32,900
Oh, there he is.

4558
04:02:33,660 --> 04:02:34,320
I'm a good parent.

4559
04:02:41,360 --> 04:02:44,120
What the fuck are you gonna do with the head?

4560
04:02:44,120 --> 04:02:44,880
What?

4561
04:02:49,080 --> 04:02:50,440
The fish?

4562
04:02:50,760 --> 04:02:52,000
We have fishies?

4563
04:02:54,120 --> 04:02:54,620
Alright.

4564
04:02:56,640 --> 04:02:57,760
That's fine.

4565
04:02:58,300 --> 04:02:59,140
Just gotta learn.

4566
04:02:59,480 --> 04:03:00,140
Oh, wait, nice.

4567
04:03:02,120 --> 04:03:02,800
Arrow.

4568
04:03:05,340 --> 04:03:07,840
I don't remember how to play this game!

4569
04:03:09,840 --> 04:03:10,580
Oh, fuck!

4570
04:03:10,920 --> 04:03:11,640
Oh my god, okay.

4571
04:03:12,300 --> 04:03:13,660
Oh, my axe!

4572
04:03:13,760 --> 04:03:14,320
Give me my axe!

4573
04:03:14,440 --> 04:03:15,040
I don't remember!

4574
04:03:15,400 --> 04:03:15,920
Oh, fuck!

4575
04:03:23,160 --> 04:03:24,220
Oh, shit.

4576
04:03:28,190 --> 04:03:29,910
Oh my god, I'm running!

4577
04:03:30,050 --> 04:03:30,550
I'm running!

4578
04:03:31,610 --> 04:03:33,310
That's fuck- oh, are you serious?

4579
04:03:34,510 --> 04:03:36,750
Oh my god, just fucking just shoot your arrows.

4580
04:03:37,310 --> 04:03:38,250
Just shoot your arrows.

4581
04:03:39,430 --> 04:03:41,690
I don't know what the other controls are.

4582
04:03:43,190 --> 04:03:44,150
That's fine.

4583
04:03:44,870 --> 04:03:45,970
Just keep shooting!

4584
04:03:46,710 --> 04:03:47,830
Just keep shooting!

4585
04:03:47,830 --> 04:03:49,470
I'll just keep whaling on him!

4586
04:03:50,710 --> 04:03:51,690
That's right!

4587
04:03:53,770 --> 04:03:55,350
Just keep dancing!

4588
04:04:01,530 --> 04:04:02,990
Oh my god.

4589
04:04:03,590 --> 04:04:05,470
Oh, it's the wolf attack!

4590
04:04:06,310 --> 04:04:06,710
Nice.

4591
04:04:07,650 --> 04:04:08,110
Nice.

4592
04:04:08,530 --> 04:04:09,890
Alright, I lost a lot of HP.

4593
04:04:10,750 --> 04:04:12,910
But that's how you're supposed to play the game, right?

4594
04:04:12,910 --> 04:04:13,550
Alright.

4595
04:04:15,390 --> 04:04:16,410
That's fine.

4596
04:04:16,610 --> 04:04:17,890
I lost a lot.

4597
04:04:20,550 --> 04:04:21,630
That's okay.

4598
04:04:22,630 --> 04:04:24,230
Let's put on a show!

4599
04:04:24,930 --> 04:04:25,950
God, shit.

4600
04:04:26,210 --> 04:04:26,450
Fuck.

4601
04:04:26,670 --> 04:04:26,890
Okay.

4602
04:04:27,710 --> 04:04:29,690
Oh my god, my fucking brain riots.

4603
04:04:30,750 --> 04:04:32,830
My brain riots terminal.

4604
04:04:33,250 --> 04:04:35,730
Guys, it's- It's terminal.

4605
04:04:37,530 --> 04:04:40,430
How do I- How do I open this?

4606
04:04:40,430 --> 04:04:42,170
Do I have it to open this?

4607
04:04:43,310 --> 04:04:43,830
Oh!

4608
04:04:43,990 --> 04:04:44,950
Just stabbed the head.

4609
04:04:45,270 --> 04:04:45,790
Nevermind.

4610
04:04:47,930 --> 04:04:51,710
I got a little confused, because there was a glowing thing to my right.

4611
04:04:52,670 --> 04:04:55,990
I can now read the language of Muspelheim?

4612
04:04:56,290 --> 04:04:56,810
Oh!

4613
04:04:57,730 --> 04:04:59,410
I can visit the Fire Realm.

4614
04:05:00,730 --> 04:05:01,250
Oh!

4615
04:05:02,590 --> 04:05:03,110
Nice.

4616
04:05:04,730 --> 04:05:08,050
Thank you, it's been an incredible and fantastic year, hasn't it?

4617
04:05:08,050 --> 04:05:09,470
My birthday is on the 30th.

4618
04:05:09,510 --> 04:05:11,830
Can you close this year of mine by wishing me a happy birthday?

4619
04:05:12,410 --> 04:05:13,710
Glad you got your golden rivals.

4620
04:05:13,850 --> 04:05:14,670
You did right!

4621
04:05:14,810 --> 04:05:15,750
Thank you for the super chat!

4622
04:05:15,890 --> 04:05:16,090
Thank you!

4623
04:05:16,970 --> 04:05:18,710
Happy birthday to you!

4624
04:05:19,130 --> 04:05:20,690
Happy birthday to you!

4625
04:05:20,990 --> 04:05:22,770
Happy birthday, dear Delta!

4626
04:05:23,370 --> 04:05:25,090
Happy birthday to you!

4627
04:05:25,330 --> 04:05:25,690
Yeah!

4628
04:05:26,190 --> 04:05:27,130
Wait, how do I get up?

4629
04:05:28,290 --> 04:05:30,210
Oh, I just have to walk up.

4630
04:05:30,610 --> 04:05:30,870
Okay.

4631
04:05:32,370 --> 04:05:32,810
What's that?

4632
04:05:36,550 --> 04:05:37,230
That's fine.

4633
04:05:37,370 --> 04:05:38,470
I ain't no god.

4634
04:05:38,610 --> 04:05:41,490
I say as the deepest god of war.

4635
04:05:43,110 --> 04:05:43,750
Oh!

4636
04:05:44,550 --> 04:05:45,090
Where?

4637
04:05:46,550 --> 04:05:47,190
Who?

4638
04:05:48,030 --> 04:05:49,350
What are you looking at?

4639
04:05:50,110 --> 04:05:51,050
Oh, the turtle!

4640
04:05:52,410 --> 04:05:54,210
Do you think the pig is still alive?

4641
04:05:56,410 --> 04:05:57,730
Okay, is this a shortcut?

4642
04:05:58,010 --> 04:05:58,290
No.

4643
04:05:58,890 --> 04:05:59,570
What's this?

4644
04:06:01,930 --> 04:06:03,790
Oh, where do I put this?

4645
04:06:06,290 --> 04:06:08,790
Oh, right here!

4646
04:06:09,110 --> 04:06:09,370
Okay.

4647
04:06:13,370 --> 04:06:14,550
Now what do I do?

4648
04:06:17,170 --> 04:06:19,030
What the fuck do I do?

4649
04:06:19,030 --> 04:06:20,850
Oh, there you go.

4650
04:06:22,210 --> 04:06:22,850
Do your thing.

4651
04:06:23,850 --> 04:06:25,390
Boy, do your fucking thing, boy!

4652
04:06:26,890 --> 04:06:27,470
Boy!

4653
04:06:27,470 --> 04:06:28,350
Boy!

4654
04:06:31,470 --> 04:06:33,510
This is not...

4655
04:06:33,910 --> 04:06:35,730
Oh, no.

4656
04:06:36,470 --> 04:06:37,130
It's a puzzle?

4657
04:06:37,770 --> 04:06:39,750
Oh my god, I just played for hours.

4658
04:06:39,890 --> 04:06:42,610
My brain is not ready for a puzzle.

4659
04:06:43,270 --> 04:06:43,870
My...

4660
04:06:45,250 --> 04:06:46,450
Oh, it's...

4661
04:06:46,450 --> 04:06:48,010
Oh, it's...

4662
04:06:49,110 --> 04:06:52,310
The hardest fucking puzzle of my fucking life.

4663
04:06:52,710 --> 04:06:54,950
Oh my god, I figured it out, guys.

4664
04:06:55,090 --> 04:06:55,650
Read, boy!

4665
04:06:55,690 --> 04:06:56,390
I'm illiterate.

4666
04:06:56,390 --> 04:06:57,930
That's going in the journal.

4667
04:06:58,270 --> 04:07:00,410
One of the hardest things I've ever done.

4668
04:07:02,530 --> 04:07:05,370
Oh my god, what a hard puzzle, guys.

4669
04:07:05,890 --> 04:07:08,550
Holy shit, that puzzle was so hard.

4670
04:07:09,510 --> 04:07:10,190
El Frigg!

4671
04:07:10,370 --> 04:07:13,370
Generous Frigg, who gave the world her brightest light.

4672
04:07:13,710 --> 04:07:18,290
Young Baldr, Gleaming God, Pride of the Iser, Odin's son and heir to Asgard.

4673
04:07:18,790 --> 04:07:21,170
Long may she protect him, long may he protect us.

4674
04:07:21,550 --> 04:07:23,110
Hail Baldr of the Golden!

4675
04:07:23,330 --> 04:07:24,790
Hail Frigg, beloved of all!

4676
04:07:24,970 --> 04:07:26,650
Hail Odin, all-father!

4677
04:07:26,850 --> 04:07:30,410
Seems like nobody who counted on the Iser is still around.

4678
04:07:31,010 --> 04:07:31,990
God, that was so difficult.

4679
04:07:33,110 --> 04:07:35,050
I'm glad we got through that together, guys.

4680
04:07:36,790 --> 04:07:37,170
What?

4681
04:07:41,650 --> 04:07:42,850
Wait, how did you get across?

4682
04:07:43,470 --> 04:07:44,290
Oh, circle.

4683
04:07:46,430 --> 04:07:50,570
Oh, there's some more kills here, which we'll need.

4684
04:07:50,970 --> 04:07:51,950
Oh, don't worry.

4685
04:07:52,970 --> 04:07:53,830
Don't worry.

4686
04:07:54,190 --> 04:07:55,270
That's fucking right.

4687
04:07:55,450 --> 04:07:56,230
Do your thing!

4688
04:07:56,910 --> 04:07:58,250
Do your thing, boy!

4689
04:07:59,310 --> 04:08:00,470
Earn your dinner!

4690
04:08:01,750 --> 04:08:02,790
That's right!

4691
04:08:03,930 --> 04:08:04,670
Earn it!

4692
04:08:06,710 --> 04:08:07,990
Okay, whoops.

4693
04:08:08,150 --> 04:08:09,170
I mean, it's fine.

4694
04:08:09,330 --> 04:08:11,310
He has like, he literally does not die.

4695
04:08:12,190 --> 04:08:15,030
He has to earn his dinner right now, guys.

4696
04:08:15,290 --> 04:08:15,590
Alright?

4697
04:08:17,590 --> 04:08:22,450
Alright, if you don't kill at least one boy, you're not eating dinner!

4698
04:08:25,210 --> 04:08:26,630
Okay, it's fine.

4699
04:08:27,050 --> 04:08:28,290
They're like, so weak anyway.

4700
04:08:29,130 --> 04:08:31,210
I'm such a good dad.

4701
04:08:33,610 --> 04:08:34,130
Huh.

4702
04:08:34,590 --> 04:08:35,270
Oh, shit!

4703
04:08:35,690 --> 04:08:35,990
Oh!

4704
04:08:36,210 --> 04:08:36,430
Okay.

4705
04:08:37,960 --> 04:08:38,290
Yay!

4706
04:08:41,870 --> 04:08:42,930
See, guys?

4707
04:08:43,610 --> 04:08:44,910
Dad of the year.

4708
04:08:45,870 --> 04:08:47,970
I came back from- with milk.

4709
04:08:50,190 --> 04:08:50,870
Nice, alright.

4710
04:08:53,510 --> 04:08:53,950
Yeah!

4711
04:08:55,550 --> 04:08:57,610
I did my job, guys!

4712
04:08:58,270 --> 04:08:59,030
I did it.

4713
04:09:00,490 --> 04:09:01,290
What's this?

4714
04:09:03,110 --> 04:09:04,610
I don't think I need to go here.

4715
04:09:04,810 --> 04:09:05,970
Alright, time to go to the house.

4716
04:09:06,590 --> 04:09:07,630
I came back with milk.

4717
04:09:07,730 --> 04:09:09,010
I did the bare minimum, chat.

4718
04:09:10,170 --> 04:09:11,410
I did the bare minimum.

4719
04:09:11,890 --> 04:09:13,510
That's better than all the other dads in the world.

4720
04:09:14,490 --> 04:09:18,810
That's better than like, 50% of the dads in the world.

4721
04:09:19,870 --> 04:09:20,450
What?

4722
04:09:33,530 --> 04:09:34,770
What's around the arrows?

4723
04:09:37,870 --> 04:09:39,170
What's around the arrows?

4724
04:09:43,070 --> 04:09:44,850
What's wrong with the arrows?

4725
04:09:45,630 --> 04:09:48,470
Wait, now I don't have any arrows.

4726
04:09:53,350 --> 04:09:54,570
What's wrong with the arrows?

4727
04:09:57,870 --> 04:09:59,030
What's wrong with it?

4728
04:09:59,170 --> 04:10:00,730
It'd be easier if you explained it, though.

4729
04:10:04,630 --> 04:10:05,890
But they were green!

4730
04:10:10,630 --> 04:10:12,790
These arrows look so ugly!

4731
04:10:22,250 --> 04:10:23,850
He asked me to.

4732
04:10:24,090 --> 04:10:24,430
Yeah!

4733
04:10:27,650 --> 04:10:30,110
Oh my god, he gave us the green arrow.

4734
04:10:31,550 --> 04:10:33,150
He's like, this is DC.

4735
04:10:33,290 --> 04:10:34,650
We're a Marvel household.

4736
04:10:34,650 --> 04:10:34,830
We're a Marvel household.

4737
04:10:38,970 --> 04:10:42,730
He's like, how dare you bring DC into my house.

4738
04:10:50,730 --> 04:10:53,530
I mean, it's been like two months, so it should be fine, right?

4739
04:10:57,650 --> 04:10:58,090
Oh!

4740
04:11:07,270 --> 04:11:07,710
Oh!

4741
04:11:09,070 --> 04:11:12,810
Oh my god, she like, fed him like, bugs and stuff.

4742
04:11:14,110 --> 04:11:15,670
Alright, time to boil my head.

4743
04:11:15,830 --> 04:11:18,630
Oh, you know how like, they boil heads to shrink them?

4744
04:11:18,710 --> 04:11:20,010
Like, you know those shrunken heads?

4745
04:11:20,230 --> 04:11:20,970
That's what they do.

4746
04:11:24,210 --> 04:11:24,650
Ah!

4747
04:11:37,860 --> 04:11:38,460
Good.

4748
04:11:39,800 --> 04:11:40,400
Oh!

4749
04:11:43,220 --> 04:11:44,320
Oh my god.

4750
04:11:44,840 --> 04:11:45,660
He likes that.

4751
04:11:45,800 --> 04:11:46,380
You know it.

4752
04:11:46,600 --> 04:11:47,060
Look at him.

4753
04:11:52,420 --> 04:11:53,020
Majesty?

4754
04:11:56,600 --> 04:11:59,400
Wait, isn't Freya like...

4755
04:11:59,400 --> 04:11:59,700
Yeah!

4756
04:12:01,320 --> 04:12:03,040
Isn't she like, the wife?

4757
04:12:03,440 --> 04:12:03,980
The mom?

4758
04:12:07,080 --> 04:12:09,040
I'm getting confused.

4759
04:12:11,040 --> 04:12:13,240
Yeah, isn't that the...

4760
04:12:13,240 --> 04:12:13,480
Yeah.

4761
04:12:19,000 --> 04:12:19,720
Yeah,

4762
04:12:23,140 --> 04:12:24,520
I was going to say, that's Odin's way.

4763
04:12:30,200 --> 04:12:30,920
Yeah,

4764
04:12:36,520 --> 04:12:37,620
I didn't...

4765
04:12:40,980 --> 04:12:42,320
Never trust gods.

4766
04:12:42,500 --> 04:12:44,000
Not even me, I'm a god too.

4767
04:12:45,360 --> 04:12:47,440
But you're a god, father.

4768
04:12:48,280 --> 04:12:51,040
That's why you should never trust gods.

4769
04:12:58,880 --> 04:12:59,880
Tyr's temple?

4770
04:13:03,920 --> 04:13:05,920
Wait, isn't Loki half giant though?

4771
04:13:13,260 --> 04:13:13,620
Yeah.

4772
04:13:16,420 --> 04:13:17,600
Where do I go?

4773
04:13:18,200 --> 04:13:19,060
Oh, it's right here.

4774
04:13:19,140 --> 04:13:19,800
Okay, I was going to say.

4775
04:13:20,140 --> 04:13:21,320
Where the fuck do I go?

4776
04:13:25,560 --> 04:13:25,920
Yeah.

4777
04:13:26,220 --> 04:13:27,780
He's like, half giant.

4778
04:13:31,200 --> 04:13:31,980
Oh, he's all...

4779
04:13:31,980 --> 04:13:33,440
Oh yeah, because he's like, adopted!

4780
04:13:33,440 --> 04:13:33,860
Adopted!

4781
04:13:35,000 --> 04:13:35,780
I forgot.

4782
04:13:36,620 --> 04:13:37,380
He's adopted.

4783
04:13:38,540 --> 04:13:39,720
Where's the yellow paint?

4784
04:13:39,860 --> 04:13:40,820
There's a yellow hand.

4785
04:13:41,560 --> 04:13:42,700
It's made just for me.

4786
04:13:44,680 --> 04:13:45,940
The yellow hand.

4787
04:13:49,820 --> 04:13:51,280
This is so long.

4788
04:13:52,280 --> 04:13:53,840
It's such a long elevator.

4789
04:13:54,640 --> 04:13:55,540
Alright, new destination.

4790
04:13:55,660 --> 04:13:56,880
Let me open this portal first.

4791
04:14:01,070 --> 04:14:06,490
Guys, I'm confusing my Marvel lore from actual Norse lore.

4792
04:14:10,710 --> 04:14:13,430
It's all blurring together right now.

4793
04:14:13,570 --> 04:14:21,050
I'm mixing the Marvel universe with the actual Norse lore.

4794
04:14:30,990 --> 04:14:31,390
Hahaha.

4795
04:14:31,390 --> 04:14:32,530
Yeah, but he dies.

4796
04:14:33,150 --> 04:14:34,490
He actually dies in the lore.

4797
04:14:35,130 --> 04:14:35,730
I forgot how.

4798
04:14:37,150 --> 04:14:38,730
He got killed by like, something dumb.

4799
04:14:51,770 --> 04:14:54,230
Everyone dies, Doki.

4800
04:14:54,670 --> 04:14:58,890
Yeah, but in the actual lore itself.

4801
04:14:59,530 --> 04:15:00,290
Sorry.

4802
04:15:01,070 --> 04:15:13,590
In the actual mythology of Baldur, I remember he was like invulnerable, but he dies a really pathetic death.

4803
04:15:18,680 --> 04:15:19,060
Alright.

4804
04:15:19,880 --> 04:15:22,840
Off we go to see the giants.

4805
04:15:24,220 --> 04:15:25,800
Snow giants.

4806
04:15:28,200 --> 04:15:29,000
Alright.

4807
04:15:29,540 --> 04:15:32,240
We're gonna see giant woman.

4808
04:15:36,580 --> 04:15:37,120
Oh.

4809
04:15:37,520 --> 04:15:38,060
Alright, cool.

4810
04:15:38,280 --> 04:15:39,320
Wait, there's a salamander.

4811
04:15:40,920 --> 04:15:42,140
There was a salamander.

4812
04:15:45,720 --> 04:15:47,180
Alright, get in here.

4813
04:15:50,080 --> 04:15:50,880
Hahaha.

4814
04:15:55,480 --> 04:15:56,260
Oh.

4815
04:15:57,200 --> 04:15:57,480
No!

4816
04:15:58,440 --> 04:15:59,220
Hahaha.

4817
04:16:01,660 --> 04:16:03,300
It was so close.

4818
04:16:03,900 --> 04:16:05,080
It was so close.

4819
04:16:06,960 --> 04:16:07,580
Alright, blow.

4820
04:16:09,600 --> 04:16:11,420
Run, seagulls.

4821
04:16:11,820 --> 04:16:13,040
We gotta eat tonight.

4822
04:16:14,500 --> 04:16:15,700
Hello, world serpent.

4823
04:16:22,090 --> 04:16:22,870
Hello.

4824
04:16:23,510 --> 04:16:25,570
I came back after four months.

4825
04:16:25,570 --> 04:16:26,810
I'm back now.

4826
04:16:26,990 --> 04:16:29,270
I swear I won't leave ever again.

4827
04:16:30,150 --> 04:16:31,350
Oh, shit.

4828
04:16:31,490 --> 04:16:32,390
Yeah, fuck him.

4829
04:16:41,070 --> 04:16:41,670
Hahaha.

4830
04:16:55,570 --> 04:16:57,370
Oh yeah, that's Loki's son.

4831
04:16:57,910 --> 04:16:59,790
Holy shit, is Loki okay?

4832
04:17:00,430 --> 04:17:01,010
Like...

4833
04:17:01,010 --> 04:17:01,370
Hahaha.

4834
04:17:04,290 --> 04:17:05,010
Like...

4835
04:17:05,290 --> 04:17:06,630
Oh my god.

4836
04:17:08,150 --> 04:17:11,830
Never been the same since the gay birth to that snake.

4837
04:17:14,070 --> 04:17:14,790
Oh.

4838
04:17:24,650 --> 04:17:26,930
Anybody have to push that up?

4839
04:17:28,170 --> 04:17:30,770
I don't think anybody will be okay after that.

4840
04:17:34,630 --> 04:17:35,330
Hello.

4841
04:17:45,820 --> 04:17:47,220
Hello.

4842
04:17:57,020 --> 04:17:58,460
He can talk?

4843
04:18:14,950 --> 04:18:16,010
What's he saying?

4844
04:18:20,410 --> 04:18:21,310
What's he saying?

4845
04:18:21,310 --> 04:18:21,310
What?

4846
04:18:21,410 --> 04:18:22,230
What is it?

4847
04:18:23,990 --> 04:18:24,530
Wait, okay.

4848
04:18:24,630 --> 04:18:26,510
Wait, he said like a lot of things, Mr. Head.

4849
04:18:27,290 --> 04:18:32,990
Mirror, he said like at least like 10 sentences and I don't get a translation?

4850
04:18:34,430 --> 04:18:34,870
Like...

4851
04:18:34,870 --> 04:18:36,590
He said something important to me.

4852
04:18:39,510 --> 04:18:39,790
Oh.

4853
04:18:55,090 --> 04:18:56,870
Okay, but where do we find the...

4854
04:18:56,870 --> 04:18:57,490
Oh, okay.

4855
04:18:57,790 --> 04:18:58,650
He knows where it is.

4856
04:18:58,690 --> 04:18:59,170
That's good.

4857
04:19:07,930 --> 04:19:08,390
Hahaha.

4858
04:19:11,790 --> 04:19:13,510
We're gonna have to give him a drink later.

4859
04:19:15,510 --> 04:19:15,970
What's that?

4860
04:19:16,990 --> 04:19:17,370
Oh yeah!

4861
04:19:22,230 --> 04:19:23,970
Boy, we are not exploring.

4862
04:19:24,250 --> 04:19:25,650
We gotta get the chisel, boy.

4863
04:19:28,170 --> 04:19:30,150
Oh boy, it's time.

4864
04:19:31,350 --> 04:19:32,250
How do I get down?

4865
04:19:32,250 --> 04:19:33,670
Oh, it's here.

4866
04:19:34,070 --> 04:19:34,790
Alright, boy.

4867
04:19:35,770 --> 04:19:37,190
This is not a field trip.

4868
04:19:37,330 --> 04:19:38,150
We're on a mission.

4869
04:19:42,150 --> 04:19:43,250
Okay, where's the hand?

4870
04:19:43,870 --> 04:19:45,010
Where's my yellow hand?

4871
04:19:45,670 --> 04:19:46,350
Oh, there it is.

4872
04:19:46,650 --> 04:19:47,450
Oh, wait.

4873
04:19:48,110 --> 04:19:49,270
We should be at...

4874
04:19:49,270 --> 04:19:50,430
Shouldn't we get the chisel?

4875
04:19:52,630 --> 04:19:53,430
And then...

4876
04:19:53,430 --> 04:19:56,030
And after we get to the chisel, then we get to...

4877
04:19:56,030 --> 04:19:56,050
Yoda.

4878
04:19:57,990 --> 04:19:59,310
Oh my god, you stupid bird.

4879
04:20:01,570 --> 04:20:02,570
God damn it.

4880
04:20:02,570 --> 04:20:03,010
God fucking damn it.

4881
04:20:03,110 --> 04:20:03,950
Okay, don't worry.

4882
04:20:04,030 --> 04:20:04,810
I got the next bird.

4883
04:20:05,630 --> 04:20:07,030
There's no way he'll know.

4884
04:20:11,350 --> 04:20:11,830
Alright.

4885
04:20:13,130 --> 04:20:14,350
Where do we go, boy?

4886
04:20:22,470 --> 04:20:24,150
Wait, what's that over there?

4887
04:20:24,810 --> 04:20:25,410
It's red.

4888
04:20:25,630 --> 04:20:26,950
Oh, is this more loot?

4889
04:20:26,950 --> 04:20:28,370
Oh, what's this?

4890
04:20:29,190 --> 04:20:30,190
What's this over there?

4891
04:20:32,570 --> 04:20:33,350
What am I doing?

4892
04:20:34,970 --> 04:20:36,770
Oh, this is extra...

4893
04:20:37,590 --> 04:20:38,790
This is extra HP?

4894
04:20:40,730 --> 04:20:41,190
Oh, nice.

4895
04:20:41,190 --> 04:20:41,430
Nice.

4896
04:20:52,450 --> 04:20:55,310
Let me get off the boat.

4897
04:21:01,230 --> 04:21:01,750
Oh.

4898
04:21:04,470 --> 04:21:04,990
Nice.

4899
04:21:06,250 --> 04:21:06,790
Oh, wait.

4900
04:21:06,810 --> 04:21:07,490
Tell me the lore.

4901
04:21:08,230 --> 04:21:09,450
You're supposed to drop me the exposition.

4902
04:21:13,470 --> 04:21:13,950
Oh.

4903
04:21:13,950 --> 04:21:14,930
Wait, where do I go from here?

4904
04:21:16,270 --> 04:21:17,090
What's this?

4905
04:21:18,430 --> 04:21:18,910
RIP.

4906
04:21:19,010 --> 04:21:19,510
Oh, no!

4907
04:21:21,070 --> 04:21:22,630
No, no, no.

4908
04:21:22,830 --> 04:21:24,810
I don't wanna... Oh, no.

4909
04:21:26,290 --> 04:21:26,990
That's fine.

4910
04:21:27,450 --> 04:21:28,330
Boy will do everything.

4911
04:21:28,550 --> 04:21:30,270
Okay, that's not fine.

4912
04:21:30,390 --> 04:21:30,930
That's fine.

4913
04:21:31,450 --> 04:21:32,030
What's he gonna do?

4914
04:21:32,090 --> 04:21:32,710
Climb up?

4915
04:21:33,730 --> 04:21:35,430
Okay, I didn't realize.

4916
04:21:35,710 --> 04:21:36,890
Oh, guys.

4917
04:21:39,110 --> 04:21:39,750
Guys.

4918
04:21:40,370 --> 04:21:42,350
They look very strong.

4919
04:21:42,990 --> 04:21:44,430
But, wait.

4920
04:21:45,150 --> 04:21:46,510
Wait, he can't go up.

4921
04:21:47,010 --> 04:21:47,810
Oh, shit!

4922
04:21:48,550 --> 04:21:49,190
Guys!

4923
04:21:49,790 --> 04:21:50,890
He can climb up!

4924
04:21:51,830 --> 04:21:52,390
It's fine.

4925
04:21:52,490 --> 04:21:52,970
It's fine.

4926
04:21:53,470 --> 04:21:54,450
It's fine.

4927
04:21:54,970 --> 04:21:55,650
It's fine.

4928
04:21:56,410 --> 04:21:58,310
Two of them can't climb up, right?

4929
04:22:00,650 --> 04:22:01,890
We're doing one by one.

4930
04:22:02,590 --> 04:22:03,530
That's fine.

4931
04:22:05,530 --> 04:22:06,510
Oh, shit!

4932
04:22:06,590 --> 04:22:07,790
I died!

4933
04:22:08,190 --> 04:22:12,890
I was like...

4934
04:22:12,890 --> 04:22:13,810
Wait, what's that?

4935
04:22:14,030 --> 04:22:16,190
I'm gonna put my hand to it, just like Silent Hill.

4936
04:22:17,210 --> 04:22:18,570
What could go wrong?

4937
04:22:20,150 --> 04:22:21,030
Oh, my God.

4938
04:22:21,070 --> 04:22:21,670
They can climb.

4939
04:22:22,270 --> 04:22:23,270
Who would've thought?

4940
04:22:24,550 --> 04:22:25,370
What's up in here?

4941
04:22:26,950 --> 04:22:27,830
Hello, guys.

4942
04:22:27,830 --> 04:22:28,410
Oh!

4943
04:22:31,470 --> 04:22:32,290
What is that?

4944
04:22:39,950 --> 04:22:40,930
He's not a dwarf.

4945
04:22:42,250 --> 04:22:43,290
Wait, how did he become a dragon?

4946
04:22:45,030 --> 04:22:45,830
Is that how...

4947
04:22:51,270 --> 04:22:53,290
How the fuck did he become a dragon?

4948
04:22:56,950 --> 04:22:58,110
What did he do?

4949
04:22:58,330 --> 04:22:59,750
What a glow-up.

4950
04:23:00,450 --> 04:23:02,250
That's not how evolution works.

4951
04:23:03,890 --> 04:23:05,530
How tiny become big.

4952
04:23:06,010 --> 04:23:07,670
And big become tiny.

4953
04:23:10,510 --> 04:23:11,570
No, that's not true.

4954
04:23:11,650 --> 04:23:12,710
Horses became big.

4955
04:23:13,010 --> 04:23:13,550
Hey, guys.

4956
04:23:13,710 --> 04:23:14,670
Are you bad people?

4957
04:23:14,830 --> 04:23:15,590
Oh, they're bad people.

4958
04:23:15,810 --> 04:23:17,990
Oh, I thought they were good people for some reason.

4959
04:23:20,130 --> 04:23:21,170
Alright, don't worry.

4960
04:23:23,990 --> 04:23:24,630
Okay.

4961
04:23:24,630 --> 04:23:25,070
Oh, fuck!

4962
04:23:25,130 --> 04:23:25,710
He's purple.

4963
04:23:26,370 --> 04:23:28,570
I don't know what to do when they're purple.

4964
04:23:30,730 --> 04:23:32,830
They fuck me up, guys.

4965
04:23:34,430 --> 04:23:37,450
Last time they were purple, they fuck me up.

4966
04:23:37,890 --> 04:23:38,690
I'm scared.

4967
04:23:41,770 --> 04:23:42,410
Okay.

4968
04:23:42,890 --> 04:23:44,750
The shield will eventually break, right?

4969
04:23:48,190 --> 04:23:48,830
Okay.

4970
04:23:51,170 --> 04:23:52,130
You mean you're not ready?

4971
04:23:52,350 --> 04:23:54,010
What do you mean you're not ready?

4972
04:23:55,750 --> 04:23:57,470
What do you mean, boy?

4973
04:23:59,230 --> 04:24:00,750
Boy, be ready!

4974
04:24:02,890 --> 04:24:04,070
Boy, do your thing!

4975
04:24:04,950 --> 04:24:05,910
Oh my god.

4976
04:24:06,290 --> 04:24:07,850
Oh my god, boy, please.

4977
04:24:08,590 --> 04:24:12,070
Boy, please do your fuck thing, boy.

4978
04:24:13,810 --> 04:24:14,510
Okay, nice.

4979
04:24:14,750 --> 04:24:15,790
Wait, there's more?

4980
04:24:16,450 --> 04:24:17,870
Oh my god.

4981
04:24:17,870 --> 04:24:17,990
Oh my god.

4982
04:24:18,530 --> 04:24:22,090
You think you can just throw that at me and everything will be okay?

4983
04:24:23,490 --> 04:24:24,850
Oh, where's the last guy?

4984
04:24:28,600 --> 04:24:29,920
Where's the last guy?

4985
04:24:30,820 --> 04:24:31,840
Did I kill him?

4986
04:24:32,800 --> 04:24:33,940
Oh, I killed him.

4987
04:24:35,340 --> 04:24:35,860
Nice.

4988
04:24:36,480 --> 04:24:38,080
Oh, it seems like there's still boss music.

4989
04:24:41,400 --> 04:24:41,920
Alright.

4990
04:24:42,280 --> 04:24:44,000
We gotta figure this out, guys.

4991
04:24:46,940 --> 04:24:48,060
Shields...

4992
04:24:48,060 --> 04:24:48,960
Shields are for pussies.

4993
04:24:49,660 --> 04:24:51,300
That's what Kratos would say.

4994
04:24:54,990 --> 04:24:55,550
Okay.

4995
04:24:56,230 --> 04:24:57,570
So that's one...

4996
04:24:57,570 --> 04:24:58,450
Oh, fuck!

4997
04:24:58,750 --> 04:25:00,830
Okay, sorry.

4998
04:25:02,670 --> 04:25:06,330
How do I activate this?

4999
04:25:11,140 --> 04:25:13,640
I fucking activate.

5000
04:25:14,580 --> 04:25:15,780
What the fuck?

5001
04:25:18,160 --> 04:25:19,540
Oh, break it?

5002
04:25:21,760 --> 04:25:22,600
That's right.

5003
04:25:22,880 --> 04:25:23,960
I don't need my...

5004
04:25:23,960 --> 04:25:25,940
I just fucking use my...

5005
04:25:25,940 --> 04:25:26,680
Who cares?

5006
04:25:27,340 --> 04:25:29,060
This damage is nothing!

5007
04:25:30,280 --> 04:25:32,220
I'm gonna take it all!

5008
04:25:34,060 --> 04:25:34,840
Yeah, how do you do it?

5009
04:25:41,600 --> 04:25:42,120
Yeah.

5010
04:25:49,900 --> 04:25:52,440
How did he become...

5011
04:25:52,440 --> 04:25:54,240
How the fuck did he become a dragon?

5012
04:25:54,820 --> 04:25:56,160
Did he get cursed or something?

5013
04:25:58,500 --> 04:25:59,660
Is this the other one?

5014
04:26:00,100 --> 04:26:00,600
Hey, guys!

5015
04:26:02,140 --> 04:26:02,820
Guys!

5016
04:26:02,820 --> 04:26:04,880
Oh, so that's where you went to!

5017
04:26:05,160 --> 04:26:05,960
Oh, fuck!

5018
04:26:06,620 --> 04:26:07,620
Oh, fuck!

5019
04:26:08,180 --> 04:26:08,740
Guys!

5020
04:26:09,680 --> 04:26:11,200
Guys, I might need to use a shield.

5021
04:26:11,320 --> 04:26:11,580
Guys!

5022
04:26:13,140 --> 04:26:15,360
Maybe you're right, guys.

5023
04:26:16,020 --> 04:26:18,520
Maybe a shield is it, guys.

5024
04:26:24,720 --> 04:26:25,400
Okay.

5025
04:26:30,600 --> 04:26:31,260
Don't worry!

5026
04:26:32,080 --> 04:26:33,200
Boy, aggro him, boy!

5027
04:26:37,580 --> 04:26:39,200
Boy, please do your thing, boy!

5028
04:26:40,700 --> 04:26:41,680
Not him!

5029
04:26:43,980 --> 04:26:44,660
Oh, god.

5030
04:26:45,100 --> 04:26:45,620
Oh, god.

5031
04:26:47,540 --> 04:26:48,320
Oh, god!

5032
04:26:48,720 --> 04:26:49,760
Oh, invincibility!

5033
04:26:49,920 --> 04:26:51,340
Thank god for the invincibility!

5034
04:26:52,800 --> 04:26:53,760
Boy, please!

5035
04:26:54,400 --> 04:26:55,380
Do your thing, boy!

5036
04:26:55,640 --> 04:26:57,240
Oh, thank god he hit you!

5037
04:26:58,100 --> 04:26:58,820
Thank you!

5038
04:26:59,640 --> 04:27:00,740
Thank you for taking it!

5039
04:27:02,920 --> 04:27:03,360
Thank you for taking it!

5040
04:27:04,400 --> 04:27:05,980
Guys, we don't need a...

5041
04:27:05,980 --> 04:27:07,680
Blocking is for pussies!

5042
04:27:08,220 --> 04:27:10,800
That's right, it's all about the dodge!

5043
04:27:16,360 --> 04:27:16,800
Nevermind.

5044
04:27:17,920 --> 04:27:18,360
Never...

5045
04:27:21,120 --> 04:27:21,560
Nevermind.

5046
04:27:21,720 --> 04:27:22,520
Where am I?

5047
04:27:22,900 --> 04:27:24,000
Do I have to do this again?

5048
04:27:24,300 --> 04:27:26,040
Oh, god, please don't tell me I have to...

5049
04:27:26,040 --> 04:27:27,180
Okay, no, I don't.

5050
04:27:27,480 --> 04:27:28,060
I don't.

5051
04:27:28,140 --> 04:27:29,680
I just have to do this part again.

5052
04:27:31,440 --> 04:27:33,140
I don't take it back.

5053
04:27:33,760 --> 04:27:34,980
Are you ser... Okay.

5054
04:27:35,300 --> 04:27:36,320
Alright, you little fucker.

5055
04:27:36,340 --> 04:27:37,640
I'm trying to free you right now.

5056
04:27:38,460 --> 04:27:39,280
Alright, get up here.

5057
04:27:40,280 --> 04:27:40,640
Alright.

5058
04:27:41,240 --> 04:27:43,100
Now that I know...

5059
04:27:43,100 --> 04:27:46,040
That he's very, very, very strong...

5060
04:27:47,040 --> 04:27:49,000
I'm gonna use my rage.

5061
04:27:49,680 --> 04:27:51,820
I'm gonna get very angry now.

5062
04:27:52,760 --> 04:27:54,220
That's fucking right.

5063
04:27:54,220 --> 04:27:54,360
That's right.

5064
04:27:55,180 --> 04:27:58,360
I'm gonna get so fucking angry.

5065
04:27:59,440 --> 04:28:02,000
I'm gonna get so angry.

5066
04:28:02,640 --> 04:28:05,920
That's right.

5067
04:28:06,080 --> 04:28:07,100
Oh, shit!

5068
04:28:07,420 --> 04:28:07,920
Guys.

5069
04:28:09,200 --> 04:28:11,340
Guys, I thought...

5070
04:28:11,340 --> 04:28:13,360
When I get angry...

5071
04:28:13,360 --> 04:28:15,420
That, like...

5072
04:28:15,420 --> 04:28:16,460
It'd be easier.

5073
04:28:16,900 --> 04:28:18,880
I thought...

5074
04:28:19,920 --> 04:28:20,560
Guys...

5075
04:28:21,700 --> 04:28:23,840
Guys, I don't think it's easier.

5076
04:28:23,840 --> 04:28:24,360
I...

5077
04:28:29,140 --> 04:28:32,540
Guys, this doesn't look easier.

5078
04:28:32,740 --> 04:28:33,200
Guys.

5079
04:28:33,940 --> 04:28:35,300
Oh, my God.

5080
04:28:36,000 --> 04:28:36,780
Give me the heals.

5081
04:28:37,140 --> 04:28:38,440
Oh, it was just that?

5082
04:28:38,720 --> 04:28:39,420
That's fine.

5083
04:28:40,740 --> 04:28:41,680
That's fine.

5084
04:28:42,260 --> 04:28:43,940
Don't worry, I believe in you, boy.

5085
04:28:44,600 --> 04:28:45,200
Wow!

5086
04:28:45,480 --> 04:28:46,700
Are you serious?

5087
04:28:46,840 --> 04:28:49,300
That aggro to my fucking body!

5088
04:28:54,240 --> 04:28:55,840
Oh, my God.

5089
04:28:56,800 --> 04:28:58,860
That aggro to my fucking body.

5090
04:28:59,020 --> 04:29:00,080
I dodged that.

5091
04:29:00,540 --> 04:29:01,420
I actually...

5092
04:29:01,420 --> 04:29:02,720
I swear I dodged it.

5093
04:29:06,520 --> 04:29:07,660
Oh, my God.

5094
04:29:07,940 --> 04:29:10,620
Only weaklings dodge...

5095
04:29:10,620 --> 04:29:12,100
Weakling use the shield.

5096
04:29:13,060 --> 04:29:13,380
Fine.

5097
04:29:14,060 --> 04:29:14,920
I'll do it.

5098
04:29:16,960 --> 04:29:17,960
That's fucking...

5099
04:29:17,960 --> 04:29:18,340
Get over here.

5100
04:29:18,680 --> 04:29:19,160
Get over here.

5101
04:29:19,640 --> 04:29:22,200
Oh, my God.

5102
04:29:22,200 --> 04:29:22,860
Get over here.

5103
04:29:24,520 --> 04:29:25,320
Rage!

5104
04:29:26,020 --> 04:29:28,040
I'm a fucking rager!

5105
04:29:28,880 --> 04:29:29,380
Okay.

5106
04:29:37,990 --> 04:29:39,810
My shield was up.

5107
04:29:40,530 --> 04:29:40,850
Guys.

5108
04:29:41,650 --> 04:29:43,470
My shield.

5109
04:29:45,670 --> 04:29:46,950
I saw you guys.

5110
04:29:47,150 --> 04:29:48,490
I said I can shield.

5111
04:29:49,870 --> 04:29:50,670
I...

5112
04:29:53,230 --> 04:29:54,030
I...

5113
04:29:54,030 --> 04:29:55,030
I...

5114
04:29:55,030 --> 04:29:56,670
Oh, my God.

5115
04:29:56,770 --> 04:29:58,410
Oh, it can't be blocked.

5116
04:29:58,570 --> 04:30:00,590
It's just like... Okay, guys.

5117
04:30:01,690 --> 04:30:02,370
Guys.

5118
04:30:02,550 --> 04:30:03,910
It's just like...

5119
04:30:04,810 --> 04:30:06,410
It's just like Dark Souls.

5120
04:30:06,530 --> 04:30:06,910
I forgot.

5121
04:30:11,230 --> 04:30:12,290
That's fucking right.

5122
04:30:14,810 --> 04:30:16,530
I'm fucking... I'm so mad.

5123
04:30:24,540 --> 04:30:26,080
Oh, my... What?

5124
04:30:31,010 --> 04:30:32,190
Oh, my God.

5125
04:30:32,190 --> 04:30:34,310
Okay, guys.

5126
04:30:35,110 --> 04:30:36,230
I'm not...

5127
04:30:36,230 --> 04:30:38,050
I'm not mad enough, guys.

5128
04:30:38,910 --> 04:30:40,510
I'm not clearly...

5129
04:30:40,930 --> 04:30:43,670
I'm clearly not mad enough, guys.

5130
04:30:43,990 --> 04:30:46,590
I'm clearly...

5131
04:30:47,990 --> 04:30:50,350
No, I can do this, guys.

5132
04:30:50,430 --> 04:30:52,330
We were so close from before.

5133
04:30:52,950 --> 04:30:54,390
Alright, we'll use our rage later.

5134
04:30:56,170 --> 04:30:58,030
We'll use the rage later.

5135
04:30:59,090 --> 04:30:59,810
Alright.

5136
04:30:59,810 --> 04:31:00,030
Alright.

5137
04:31:03,350 --> 04:31:05,010
Come on, boy.

5138
04:31:05,570 --> 04:31:06,830
Wait, where did he go?

5139
04:31:07,130 --> 04:31:08,370
Are you serious?

5140
04:31:08,490 --> 04:31:10,130
You fucking tripped?

5141
04:31:14,430 --> 04:31:17,250
You fucking tripped, boy?

5142
04:31:19,670 --> 04:31:20,290
Ow!

5143
04:31:23,660 --> 04:31:24,120
Oh, God.

5144
04:31:24,720 --> 04:31:25,160
Oh, God.

5145
04:31:25,620 --> 04:31:26,180
Oh, God.

5146
04:31:29,620 --> 04:31:30,720
Yeah, that's right.

5147
04:31:30,720 --> 04:31:32,680
Hit the boy, not me.

5148
04:31:33,980 --> 04:31:35,280
Ah, shit!

5149
04:31:36,180 --> 04:31:37,000
It's time.

5150
04:31:38,160 --> 04:31:38,960
It's time.

5151
04:31:39,460 --> 04:31:40,400
It's fucking time.

5152
04:31:40,780 --> 04:31:41,840
I'm fucking... I'm ready.

5153
04:31:42,500 --> 04:31:43,660
I'm fucking ready now.

5154
04:31:43,840 --> 04:31:45,200
I'm so ready.

5155
04:31:46,440 --> 04:31:47,420
I'm so ready.

5156
04:31:47,920 --> 04:31:49,040
Oh, my God.

5157
04:31:49,100 --> 04:31:50,480
I'm so fucking ready.

5158
04:31:51,160 --> 04:31:52,320
I'm not ready anymore.

5159
04:31:52,420 --> 04:31:53,200
I'm not ready anymore.

5160
04:31:54,600 --> 04:31:55,880
I'm not...

5161
04:31:57,440 --> 04:31:59,660
Okay, this is not fair.

5162
04:32:01,900 --> 04:32:03,480
Wait, what?

5163
04:32:07,390 --> 04:32:09,750
What is he...

5164
04:32:14,240 --> 04:32:15,240
What?

5165
04:32:17,280 --> 04:32:20,020
What are you...

5166
04:32:20,020 --> 04:32:20,960
What?

5167
04:32:21,580 --> 04:32:23,580
I had to...

5168
04:32:23,580 --> 04:32:24,920
I was like...

5169
04:32:24,920 --> 04:32:25,920
What is he doing?

5170
04:32:25,920 --> 04:32:28,040
What is he...

5171
04:32:29,440 --> 04:32:31,980
I had to hit the fucking...

5172
04:32:31,980 --> 04:32:33,200
Oh, my God.

5173
04:32:33,460 --> 04:32:35,340
Here we go again, boy.

5174
04:32:36,140 --> 04:32:37,720
We will learn.

5175
04:32:38,040 --> 04:32:41,760
We will fucking learn if it's the last thing I do.

5176
04:32:43,700 --> 04:32:45,920
If it's the last thing I...

5177
04:32:46,640 --> 04:32:48,620
Oh, my God.

5178
04:32:48,660 --> 04:32:49,760
He killed the wolf, though.

5179
04:32:49,980 --> 04:32:50,560
That's fine.

5180
04:32:51,740 --> 04:32:52,580
That's fine.

5181
04:32:53,560 --> 04:32:54,700
Oh, my God.

5182
04:32:54,700 --> 04:32:55,540
We gotta go.

5183
04:32:57,220 --> 04:32:57,980
Now.

5184
04:32:58,320 --> 04:32:59,020
Now.

5185
04:32:59,480 --> 04:33:00,120
Now.

5186
04:33:01,320 --> 04:33:02,900
What did he tell you when?

5187
04:33:03,380 --> 04:33:04,580
Wrong one.

5188
04:33:08,520 --> 04:33:10,380
Tell me when.

5189
04:33:10,480 --> 04:33:10,820
Okay.

5190
04:33:12,440 --> 04:33:13,780
Oh, my God.

5191
04:33:13,860 --> 04:33:14,680
I got it first.

5192
04:33:15,080 --> 04:33:15,720
Thank God.

5193
04:33:20,600 --> 04:33:22,000
Oh, my God.

5194
04:33:22,020 --> 04:33:23,440
Thank fucking God.

5195
04:33:26,020 --> 04:33:26,880
Oh, my God.

5196
04:33:26,940 --> 04:33:27,080
Oh, my God.

5197
04:33:27,080 --> 04:33:27,360
Thank God.

5198
04:33:27,460 --> 04:33:27,860
Okay, kid.

5199
04:33:27,920 --> 04:33:28,260
Get up.

5200
04:33:29,160 --> 04:33:30,040
Are you, though?

5201
04:33:30,460 --> 04:33:31,820
Are you actually ready?

5202
04:33:35,100 --> 04:33:35,900
Oh, my God.

5203
04:33:35,900 --> 04:33:36,320
I missed it.

5204
04:33:36,720 --> 04:33:37,320
Oh, my God.

5205
04:33:37,420 --> 04:33:38,020
Oh, my God.

5206
04:33:38,140 --> 04:33:38,560
I freaked out.

5207
04:33:39,580 --> 04:33:40,440
Guys, I'm sorry.

5208
04:33:40,520 --> 04:33:41,720
I was freaking out.

5209
04:33:46,120 --> 04:33:47,100
Oh, my God.

5210
04:33:49,180 --> 04:33:50,140
Oh, my God.

5211
04:33:50,160 --> 04:33:50,340
Okay.

5212
04:33:50,680 --> 04:33:51,320
We're fine.

5213
04:33:52,060 --> 04:33:55,500
God, please.

5214
04:33:56,820 --> 04:33:57,500
Please.

5215
04:33:58,420 --> 04:34:01,600
There's so many things going on.

5216
04:34:17,660 --> 04:34:18,160
Oh, my God.

5217
04:34:18,280 --> 04:34:19,720
We fucking did it.

5218
04:34:20,300 --> 04:34:21,080
Oh, my God.

5219
04:34:21,100 --> 04:34:22,400
We fucking did it.

5220
04:34:23,040 --> 04:34:26,140
Oh, my God.

5221
04:34:26,180 --> 04:34:26,540
He's dead.

5222
04:34:26,980 --> 04:34:29,420
Oh, my God.

5223
04:34:30,620 --> 04:34:32,540
I'm just happy he's dead.

5224
04:34:34,840 --> 04:34:36,140
Just kill him.

5225
04:34:36,860 --> 04:34:38,460
Oh, holy shit.

5226
04:34:40,500 --> 04:34:42,460
Okay, these guys are easy, though.

5227
04:34:44,560 --> 04:34:46,620
Oh, my boy did it.

5228
04:34:47,260 --> 04:34:48,120
My boy.

5229
04:34:49,540 --> 04:34:51,520
My fucking boy.

5230
04:34:58,200 --> 04:35:00,580
Good job, boy.

5231
04:35:07,320 --> 04:35:08,200
What?

5232
04:35:08,200 --> 04:35:09,380
What an update.

5233
04:35:09,800 --> 04:35:10,460
Oh, the traveler.

5234
04:35:11,900 --> 04:35:14,160
Alright, you're not important to me.

5235
04:35:16,520 --> 04:35:18,240
Alright, so where should the last...

5236
04:35:18,240 --> 04:35:19,800
The last one should be on my left, then.

5237
04:35:20,720 --> 04:35:21,160
Right?

5238
04:35:21,880 --> 04:35:24,000
Okay, you guys are like...

5239
04:35:24,000 --> 04:35:25,120
You're not as scary.

5240
04:35:25,360 --> 04:35:26,960
After the shit I just went...

5241
04:35:26,960 --> 04:35:30,260
Oh, and then the last one is the easiest one of them all.

5242
04:35:31,380 --> 04:35:31,860
Alright.

5243
04:35:33,460 --> 04:35:34,660
Okay, this is good.

5244
04:35:34,880 --> 04:35:36,000
I'm just gonna do the fast way.

5245
04:35:36,000 --> 04:35:37,600
I thought, like, you know...

5246
04:35:37,600 --> 04:35:41,300
Me doing a heavier attack would mean it'll break faster, but I guess...

5247
04:35:41,300 --> 04:35:42,280
Fuck me, I guess.

5248
04:35:43,740 --> 04:35:45,320
I will freeze you!

5249
04:35:47,820 --> 04:35:48,340
Hello?

5250
04:35:49,280 --> 04:35:49,680
Oh!

5251
04:35:49,860 --> 04:35:50,300
Oh!

5252
04:35:50,480 --> 04:35:50,760
Oh!

5253
04:35:50,860 --> 04:35:51,180
Sorry!

5254
04:35:51,700 --> 04:35:54,520
For some reason, I don't know why I thought he was a friendly.

5255
04:35:54,940 --> 04:35:57,060
I don't know why I thought he was friendly.

5256
04:35:57,620 --> 04:35:57,980
Whoa!

5257
04:35:59,280 --> 04:36:00,760
I was like, hey, guys!

5258
04:36:01,780 --> 04:36:03,680
Isn't this... Oh, thanks, boy.

5259
04:36:04,400 --> 04:36:05,760
Wait, is he helping?

5260
04:36:06,580 --> 04:36:07,400
Is he helping?

5261
04:36:07,540 --> 04:36:08,100
Oh, he is.

5262
04:36:08,480 --> 04:36:08,860
Nice.

5263
04:36:12,040 --> 04:36:12,600
Nice.

5264
04:36:12,700 --> 04:36:14,300
Okay, we're gonna get rid of the witch first.

5265
04:36:15,600 --> 04:36:17,060
Oh, okay!

5266
04:36:17,300 --> 04:36:18,180
Get rid of the witch.

5267
04:36:18,380 --> 04:36:19,740
Oh, my God!

5268
04:36:20,560 --> 04:36:22,800
There's too many things going on!

5269
04:36:25,000 --> 04:36:25,760
I fucking...

5270
04:36:25,760 --> 04:36:27,380
Okay, I'm using my rage art.

5271
04:36:27,940 --> 04:36:31,400
I'm... I'm gonna go get angry right now.

5272
04:36:32,860 --> 04:36:36,700
I'm gonna fucking... I'm gonna get angry!

5273
04:36:38,800 --> 04:36:39,880
That's fucking right!

5274
04:36:40,860 --> 04:36:41,700
That's right!

5275
04:36:41,940 --> 04:36:42,440
Get out of here!

5276
04:36:43,340 --> 04:36:44,360
Fucking meet me in the ring!

5277
04:36:44,860 --> 04:36:46,340
Meet me in the fucking ring!

5278
04:36:47,840 --> 04:36:48,360
Okay.

5279
04:36:49,020 --> 04:36:49,540
Nice.

5280
04:36:53,690 --> 04:36:54,970
Okay, I need you to stun her.

5281
04:36:56,510 --> 04:36:57,830
That's right, no more magic!

5282
04:36:58,270 --> 04:36:59,870
Magic's for pussies!

5283
04:37:00,790 --> 04:37:01,990
Oh, shit!

5284
04:37:02,470 --> 04:37:03,490
Oh, I'm sorry!

5285
04:37:04,350 --> 04:37:05,270
Oh, my God!

5286
04:37:05,330 --> 04:37:06,910
Boy, we need you to do all the work now.

5287
04:37:07,450 --> 04:37:07,570
Boy!

5288
04:37:07,990 --> 04:37:09,610
Boy, he's getting closer, boy!

5289
04:37:10,130 --> 04:37:11,670
Boy, he's getting...

5290
04:37:11,670 --> 04:37:11,930
Whoa!

5291
04:37:13,070 --> 04:37:13,550
Boy!

5292
04:37:14,390 --> 04:37:15,410
Boy, he's getting closer!

5293
04:37:15,930 --> 04:37:17,030
Boy, I need you to do everything!

5294
04:37:18,950 --> 04:37:19,430
Boy!

5295
04:37:19,890 --> 04:37:22,630
If I get hit, it's game over, boy!

5296
04:37:24,050 --> 04:37:26,010
Please, I need you to do everything!

5297
04:37:30,010 --> 04:37:31,530
Oh, no!

5298
04:37:39,960 --> 04:37:40,620
Why?

5299
04:37:40,740 --> 04:37:44,640
Why couldn't you do one simple job?

5300
04:37:46,400 --> 04:37:50,000
One simple job, boy!

5301
04:37:50,400 --> 04:37:52,140
You're a disappointment!

5302
04:37:53,080 --> 04:37:54,140
Oh, shit!

5303
04:37:57,260 --> 04:37:57,800
Oh, shit!

5304
04:37:57,800 --> 04:37:58,600
Oh, my God, boy!

5305
04:37:59,840 --> 04:38:01,040
I can't believe it!

5306
04:38:01,100 --> 04:38:03,100
No dinner for you tonight, boy!

5307
04:38:04,080 --> 04:38:05,440
No dinner tonight!

5308
04:38:06,040 --> 04:38:08,140
Are you serious?!

5309
04:38:11,160 --> 04:38:12,100
Oh, my God!

5310
04:38:12,140 --> 04:38:12,340
Okay.

5311
04:38:15,520 --> 04:38:15,960
Oh!

5312
04:38:17,080 --> 04:38:18,000
Oh, my God!

5313
04:38:18,020 --> 04:38:18,640
Wait, what?

5314
04:38:18,700 --> 04:38:19,680
I forgot my move!

5315
04:38:22,720 --> 04:38:23,740
What do you mean, not yet?

5316
04:38:23,960 --> 04:38:25,200
What do you mean, not yet?

5317
04:38:26,340 --> 04:38:27,480
What do you mean?

5318
04:38:30,300 --> 04:38:32,320
What do you mean not yet, boy?

5319
04:38:35,180 --> 04:38:37,000
Oh, how do I use skills again?

5320
04:38:37,260 --> 04:38:38,780
Guys, you think I remember?

5321
04:38:39,020 --> 04:38:39,640
I don't!

5322
04:38:50,700 --> 04:38:52,860
It's actually been so long!

5323
04:38:55,140 --> 04:38:56,220
Oh, my God!

5324
04:38:56,520 --> 04:38:56,720
Oh, no!

5325
04:38:57,160 --> 04:38:57,820
Oh, no!

5326
04:38:58,740 --> 04:39:01,140
This is not looking so good.

5327
04:39:01,300 --> 04:39:01,700
No!

5328
04:39:01,700 --> 04:39:03,320
No!

5329
04:39:05,380 --> 04:39:08,100
Please, we're on the same team!

5330
04:39:08,560 --> 04:39:09,180
Oh, hey, nice.

5331
04:39:11,980 --> 04:39:13,500
Oh, no.

5332
04:39:14,040 --> 04:39:16,000
There's no heals.

5333
04:39:16,980 --> 04:39:18,120
There's no heals.

5334
04:39:18,540 --> 04:39:19,460
Please, boy!

5335
04:39:21,720 --> 04:39:22,560
Please!

5336
04:39:23,680 --> 04:39:26,180
Why do you do so little?!

5337
04:39:26,180 --> 04:39:26,680
Boy!

5338
04:39:27,140 --> 04:39:29,700
Why do you do so little?!

5339
04:39:33,640 --> 04:39:33,990
No!

5340
04:39:35,040 --> 04:39:35,660
No!

5341
04:39:39,450 --> 04:39:40,720
Oh, my God!

5342
04:39:41,760 --> 04:39:44,160
He does so little damage!

5343
04:39:44,620 --> 04:39:45,180
Why?

5344
04:39:45,400 --> 04:39:47,920
Why is your damage so low?

5345
04:39:49,660 --> 04:39:50,300
Where'd it go?

5346
04:39:52,720 --> 04:39:53,900
Oh, my God!

5347
04:39:54,200 --> 04:39:55,400
I'm gonna...

5348
04:39:55,400 --> 04:39:58,020
I'm gonna see if I can get rid of him first.

5349
04:39:58,820 --> 04:40:01,500
I'm gonna get rid of... Oh, my God!

5350
04:40:01,780 --> 04:40:02,360
Please!

5351
04:40:03,680 --> 04:40:04,900
Oh, my...

5352
04:40:04,900 --> 04:40:05,520
No!

5353
04:40:07,560 --> 04:40:08,280
Yes!

5354
04:40:09,460 --> 04:40:15,200
Just need to get rid of one first and then and then I'll start punching that again!

5355
04:40:17,020 --> 04:40:18,780
That's fucking great!

5356
04:40:20,960 --> 04:40:25,860
I'm trying my best to be father of the year!

5357
04:40:26,360 --> 04:40:26,700
No!

5358
04:40:26,700 --> 04:40:27,820
And...

5359
04:40:28,700 --> 04:40:30,980
Um... Um...

5360
04:40:30,980 --> 04:40:32,240
Um...

5361
04:40:32,240 --> 04:40:34,780
Guys, I...

5362
04:40:34,780 --> 04:40:36,300
Guys!

5363
04:40:36,580 --> 04:40:36,820
God!

5364
04:40:42,910 --> 04:40:45,450
Oh, my God!

5365
04:40:46,330 --> 04:40:47,610
Okay.

5366
04:40:48,530 --> 04:40:50,470
We can do this.

5367
04:40:51,110 --> 04:40:52,430
We can do this.

5368
04:40:52,930 --> 04:40:53,370
Guys.

5369
04:40:55,130 --> 04:40:56,110
We...

5370
04:40:56,790 --> 04:40:58,330
We can do this.

5371
04:40:58,470 --> 04:40:58,830
Guys.

5372
04:41:01,730 --> 04:41:02,310
Alright.

5373
04:41:05,230 --> 04:41:05,810
This...

5374
04:41:05,810 --> 04:41:07,450
Oh, my God!

5375
04:41:08,350 --> 04:41:10,130
Why am I so...

5376
04:41:12,650 --> 04:41:13,930
I don't...

5377
04:41:13,930 --> 04:41:17,730
Why am I so fucking weak?

5378
04:41:30,560 --> 04:41:32,700
Okay, just let me lie down on the floor.

5379
04:41:33,180 --> 04:41:33,860
Let me...

5380
04:41:33,860 --> 04:41:38,720
Let me lie down on the floor and just think about my fucking consequences.

5381
04:41:38,980 --> 04:41:40,240
Why did I have a kid?

5382
04:41:40,700 --> 04:41:42,500
Why did I have...

5383
04:41:43,180 --> 04:41:45,560
Why am I so fucking weak?

5384
04:41:45,960 --> 04:41:46,840
I thought...

5385
04:41:46,840 --> 04:41:47,360
Boy!

5386
04:41:48,780 --> 04:41:49,580
Boy!

5387
04:41:50,320 --> 04:41:53,300
Why can't I kill the boy?

5388
04:41:54,040 --> 04:41:55,240
I'm gonna cheese this.

5389
04:41:55,880 --> 04:41:57,740
I'm gonna fucking cheese this.

5390
04:42:01,490 --> 04:42:03,190
I'm gonna cheese this.

5391
04:42:04,090 --> 04:42:05,930
I'm gonna cheese this.

5392
04:42:08,770 --> 04:42:11,150
I'm gonna cheese this.

5393
04:42:12,250 --> 04:42:14,110
I'm gonna...

5394
04:42:14,110 --> 04:42:15,970
I'm gonna...

5395
04:42:16,630 --> 04:42:17,970
I'm gonna...

5396
04:42:20,850 --> 04:42:22,790
Oh, my God!

5397
04:42:23,770 --> 04:42:26,150
Oh, my God!

5398
04:42:31,010 --> 04:42:32,130
This is...

5399
04:42:32,130 --> 04:42:33,230
You're so strong!

5400
04:42:33,870 --> 04:42:35,910
You're so strong!

5401
04:42:36,470 --> 04:42:39,650
Why are you so strong?

5402
04:42:41,930 --> 04:42:42,470
Okay.

5403
04:42:43,770 --> 04:42:45,470
Okay, he fucking regen.

5404
04:42:45,610 --> 04:42:46,230
That's fine.

5405
04:42:46,630 --> 04:42:48,390
I can't.

5406
04:42:48,450 --> 04:42:50,290
I can't with you.

5407
04:42:51,010 --> 04:42:52,950
Why are you like this?

5408
04:42:55,190 --> 04:42:56,770
Why are you...

5409
04:42:56,770 --> 04:42:58,070
Oh, my God!

5410
04:42:59,050 --> 04:43:00,450
Oh, my God!

5411
04:43:00,510 --> 04:43:01,630
I hope you hit the boy!

5412
04:43:05,400 --> 04:43:05,740
Oh!

5413
04:43:05,900 --> 04:43:06,480
Shit!

5414
04:43:10,300 --> 04:43:10,640
No!

5415
04:43:16,900 --> 04:43:20,760
I actually got hit in the back of the fucking...

5416
04:43:20,760 --> 04:43:22,440
Alright, I'm gonna do ultimate cheese.

5417
04:43:29,010 --> 04:43:29,490
Abaco?

5418
04:43:31,270 --> 04:43:32,030
Abaco?

5419
04:43:35,370 --> 04:43:36,550
Did I spawn them in?

5420
04:43:37,430 --> 04:43:38,870
Oh, I didn't.

5421
04:43:41,630 --> 04:43:43,170
I didn't.

5422
04:43:45,410 --> 04:43:47,330
I'm underleveled?

5423
04:43:47,630 --> 04:43:49,330
Why am I here?

5424
04:43:51,450 --> 04:43:53,490
Alright, ultimate cheese.

5425
04:43:56,910 --> 04:43:59,850
I can't climb up.

5426
04:44:04,650 --> 04:44:07,750
Guys, I can't.

5427
04:44:08,290 --> 04:44:08,850
Wait.

5428
04:44:09,230 --> 04:44:10,750
Wait a minute.

5429
04:44:12,630 --> 04:44:13,770
Wait a minute.

5430
04:44:14,470 --> 04:44:15,450
Wait a minute.

5431
04:44:15,450 --> 04:44:15,930
I...

5432
04:44:19,180 --> 04:44:19,490
Wait.

5433
04:44:20,250 --> 04:44:23,110
Wait, what do you mean I can't climb up there?

5434
04:44:23,850 --> 04:44:24,110
Wait.

5435
04:44:24,650 --> 04:44:25,640
Wait, you...

5436
04:44:28,420 --> 04:44:30,000
Oh, my God!

5437
04:44:31,460 --> 04:44:32,740
One-inch ball!

5438
04:44:35,760 --> 04:44:37,780
I'm so underleveled.

5439
04:44:38,960 --> 04:44:40,360
How do I get out of here?

5440
04:44:43,020 --> 04:44:45,040
I didn't know I'm in here.

5441
04:44:45,080 --> 04:44:47,060
I didn't know I was underleveled.

5442
04:44:47,420 --> 04:44:48,280
I just...

5443
04:44:48,280 --> 04:44:49,340
Okay, we can do this.

5444
04:44:49,400 --> 04:44:49,820
I will...

5445
04:44:51,100 --> 04:44:52,360
We can do this.

5446
04:44:53,300 --> 04:44:54,660
We can do this.

5447
04:44:54,800 --> 04:44:55,640
Where's the witch?

5448
04:44:56,220 --> 04:44:57,720
We gotta get to the witch.

5449
04:44:58,680 --> 04:45:00,460
We gotta kill the witch first.

5450
04:45:02,340 --> 04:45:03,420
Do your thing!

5451
04:45:03,540 --> 04:45:04,560
Oh, my God!

5452
04:45:05,400 --> 04:45:06,580
Not now, though.

5453
04:45:06,760 --> 04:45:08,380
Okay, maybe not this one.

5454
04:45:09,080 --> 04:45:11,300
Guys, I don't think we're gonna live through...

5455
04:45:12,680 --> 04:45:14,180
Guys, I don't...

5456
04:45:14,180 --> 04:45:15,800
Guys, we're...

5457
04:45:15,800 --> 04:45:17,160
They got me.

5458
04:45:21,920 --> 04:45:22,880
No.

5459
04:45:23,860 --> 04:45:24,340
No!

5460
04:45:26,100 --> 04:45:27,060
No!

5461
04:45:28,500 --> 04:45:29,780
Where's the witch?

5462
04:45:30,740 --> 04:45:31,360
Okay.

5463
04:45:31,840 --> 04:45:33,160
I have a plan.

5464
04:45:35,080 --> 04:45:37,460
I have a plan, guys.

5465
04:45:39,920 --> 04:45:41,340
Okay, not like that, though.

5466
04:45:41,340 --> 04:45:43,520
But I have a plan.

5467
04:45:44,940 --> 04:45:46,720
I have a plan, guys.

5468
04:45:49,400 --> 04:45:51,440
I... Okay, we die here.

5469
04:45:57,460 --> 04:45:58,020
Alright.

5470
04:45:58,500 --> 04:45:58,800
Alright.

5471
04:45:58,960 --> 04:45:59,600
No, no, no, no.

5472
04:46:00,160 --> 04:46:01,920
I have a plan for real.

5473
04:46:02,420 --> 04:46:03,140
Where's the blue arrow?

5474
04:46:03,200 --> 04:46:03,480
Okay.

5475
04:46:04,680 --> 04:46:05,720
Watch this.

5476
04:46:09,750 --> 04:46:10,850
Watch this.

5477
04:46:14,750 --> 04:46:17,170
I have a plan for real this time.

5478
04:46:18,050 --> 04:46:19,030
For real!

5479
04:46:21,430 --> 04:46:22,670
For real!

5480
04:46:24,690 --> 04:46:25,490
For real!

5481
04:46:28,450 --> 04:46:29,750
For real!

5482
04:46:33,050 --> 04:46:34,370
For real!

5483
04:46:36,710 --> 04:46:37,470
For real!

5484
04:46:39,780 --> 04:46:41,660
For real, guys!

5485
04:46:42,500 --> 04:46:43,960
No joke!

5486
04:46:44,840 --> 04:46:45,860
Oh, fuck!

5487
04:46:45,860 --> 04:46:46,360
No!

5488
04:46:52,130 --> 04:46:53,370
I am leaving.

5489
04:46:53,750 --> 04:46:54,470
How do I leave?

5490
04:46:55,390 --> 04:46:56,410
Okay, they...

5491
04:46:56,410 --> 04:46:57,110
They won.

5492
04:46:58,690 --> 04:46:59,430
They won.

5493
04:47:00,090 --> 04:47:01,090
They win.

5494
04:47:01,670 --> 04:47:03,010
Goodbye, I'll come back.

5495
04:47:08,560 --> 04:47:10,540
Boy, you gotta learn.

5496
04:47:11,440 --> 04:47:14,260
Boy, sometimes I'm not running away, boy.

5497
04:47:14,900 --> 04:47:16,100
Boy, I'm not running away.

5498
04:47:16,160 --> 04:47:17,780
We're coming back here, boy.

5499
04:47:18,580 --> 04:47:19,620
Boy, we're...

5500
04:47:19,620 --> 04:47:20,920
This is not running away.

5501
04:47:21,100 --> 04:47:22,560
We'll be back, boy.

5502
04:47:22,880 --> 04:47:25,180
I'm not a little bitch.

5503
04:47:25,700 --> 04:47:26,680
I'm just...

5504
04:47:26,680 --> 04:47:30,840
Sometimes, you just gotta come back another time.

5505
04:47:31,440 --> 04:47:32,640
It's called... Exactly.

5506
04:47:32,840 --> 04:47:35,300
It's a tactical retreat, little boy.

5507
04:47:35,900 --> 04:47:39,560
It's just... We're being tactical right now.

5508
04:47:39,860 --> 04:47:40,220
Okay?

5509
04:47:42,120 --> 04:47:45,360
Well, we will come back, okay, boy?

5510
04:47:45,360 --> 04:47:48,660
We'll definitely come back right here.

5511
04:47:49,600 --> 04:47:52,380
And then she never came back.

5512
04:47:57,040 --> 04:48:00,180
Sometimes, dad just gotta hit the gym a little extra.

5513
04:48:02,340 --> 04:48:03,280
You know?

5514
04:48:05,500 --> 04:48:06,160
Sometimes...

5515
04:48:06,160 --> 04:48:09,540
Dad's gotta spend a couple more hours at the gym, okay?

5516
04:48:11,640 --> 04:48:13,620
Wait, which way do I...

5517
04:48:16,620 --> 04:48:17,200
This way.

5518
04:48:19,340 --> 04:48:20,940
How do I get across this?

5519
04:48:27,160 --> 04:48:27,960
Oh, Pokka!

5520
04:48:28,040 --> 04:48:29,180
Thank you for the raid!

5521
04:48:29,340 --> 04:48:30,340
I really appreciate it.

5522
04:48:30,380 --> 04:48:31,180
I love you, buddy.

5523
04:48:31,980 --> 04:48:33,700
You've been playing God of War the last five hours.

5524
04:48:33,700 --> 04:48:34,100
Nice.

5525
04:48:38,320 --> 04:48:39,720
Hello?

5526
04:48:44,160 --> 04:48:45,560
Oh?

5527
04:48:47,580 --> 04:48:48,620
Who's that?

5528
04:48:50,720 --> 04:48:51,720
What?

5529
04:49:00,460 --> 04:49:03,240
Make the hole again?

5530
04:49:08,520 --> 04:49:09,380
Gross!

5531
04:49:10,540 --> 04:49:13,660
That's the love of his life, boy!

5532
04:49:14,380 --> 04:49:16,580
We literally burned your fucking mom!

5533
04:49:17,240 --> 04:49:18,760
And this is gross?

5534
04:49:27,620 --> 04:49:29,440
Oh yeah, we don't care.

5535
04:49:30,500 --> 04:49:31,000
What's this?

5536
04:49:31,280 --> 04:49:37,020
Is it even worth it?

5537
04:49:37,380 --> 04:49:38,320
Wasn't it for me, though?

5538
04:49:42,040 --> 04:49:44,720
Wait, why are you asking the child and not me?

5539
04:49:45,140 --> 04:49:46,740
I'm the adult here.

5540
04:49:46,820 --> 04:49:49,840
You think I'm just gonna let my kid do, like, some pointless task?

5541
04:49:51,000 --> 04:49:52,200
He listens to me.

5542
04:49:53,040 --> 04:49:54,360
I am the father.

5543
04:49:57,620 --> 04:49:58,700
Free bones!

5544
04:49:59,680 --> 04:50:02,060
Podoki, you'll get free bones!

5545
04:50:03,260 --> 04:50:03,840
Alright.

5546
04:50:04,340 --> 04:50:04,920
Nice.

5547
04:50:05,320 --> 04:50:06,120
Oh, shit!

5548
04:50:07,420 --> 04:50:11,720
Okay, you did not tell me about the goddamn fucking giant!

5549
04:50:14,860 --> 04:50:15,800
Okay, that's fine.

5550
04:50:16,760 --> 04:50:17,240
Wait.

5551
04:50:17,440 --> 04:50:17,880
Wait.

5552
04:50:17,980 --> 04:50:18,620
Wait a minute.

5553
04:50:20,120 --> 04:50:22,760
There's more than just a giant here.

5554
04:50:25,360 --> 04:50:25,840
Okay.

5555
04:50:26,080 --> 04:50:26,580
Oh, shit!

5556
04:50:26,660 --> 04:50:27,740
Oh, infinity dodge!

5557
04:50:29,660 --> 04:50:30,340
There you go.

5558
04:50:31,000 --> 04:50:31,480
Nice.

5559
04:50:32,520 --> 04:50:33,000
Oh!

5560
04:50:33,720 --> 04:50:34,020
Get away!

5561
04:50:34,820 --> 04:50:36,380
Wait, how do I- Oh, R3!

5562
04:50:36,700 --> 04:50:38,020
Oh, shit, the finisher!

5563
04:50:38,400 --> 04:50:38,980
What do I do?

5564
04:50:39,160 --> 04:50:39,780
What am I doing?

5565
04:50:40,620 --> 04:50:41,960
Oh yeah, that's right.

5566
04:50:41,960 --> 04:50:43,080
Get over here.

5567
04:50:43,480 --> 04:50:44,540
That's fucking right.

5568
04:50:44,640 --> 04:50:46,440
You try to flank me- Oh, sorry, boy.

5569
04:50:46,960 --> 04:50:47,940
Collateral damage.

5570
04:50:48,080 --> 04:50:49,160
It just had to be.

5571
04:50:51,320 --> 04:50:51,880
Nice.

5572
04:50:53,320 --> 04:50:55,420
Sorry, you might have got stomped a little bit.

5573
04:50:56,720 --> 04:50:57,280
Now.

5574
04:50:57,780 --> 04:50:58,820
Oh, not like that.

5575
04:50:58,960 --> 04:50:59,880
Wrong way.

5576
04:51:04,920 --> 04:51:08,240
Tell me when it shoots the fucking rock.

5577
04:51:12,400 --> 04:51:13,840
You can talk to mom again.

5578
04:51:14,200 --> 04:51:16,380
If we keep an eye out while we- Look if you wish, boy.

5579
04:51:16,920 --> 04:51:19,260
I will not be distracted by this fool's errand.

5580
04:51:19,620 --> 04:51:21,740
Bro, he looks like, like...

5581
04:51:21,740 --> 04:51:23,940
Might be from like, you know...

5582
04:51:23,940 --> 04:51:24,380
Hello.

5583
04:51:25,800 --> 04:51:27,860
You know, like those types of people.

5584
04:51:31,900 --> 04:51:36,060
You know, where they were like Jesus King from America, you know?

5585
04:51:41,960 --> 04:51:42,660
Alright, let's go.

5586
04:51:42,960 --> 04:51:44,860
Let's roll the boat away.

5587
04:51:48,100 --> 04:51:48,780
Hello.

5588
04:51:50,000 --> 04:51:50,680
Badadadadadum.

5589
04:51:51,920 --> 04:51:52,600
Badadadadadadum.

5590
04:51:52,960 --> 04:51:53,640
Badadadadadum.

5591
04:52:04,060 --> 04:52:06,100
I love Book of Mormon.

5592
04:52:06,320 --> 04:52:07,300
It's such a good musical.

5593
04:52:18,780 --> 04:52:26,120
I love it.

5594
04:52:30,680 --> 04:52:32,160
Aren't they always fighting?

5595
04:52:34,240 --> 04:52:36,120
Oh shit, he killed his son.

5596
04:52:36,860 --> 04:52:38,620
They never actually die, except for Bulde.

5597
04:52:41,960 --> 04:52:47,300
But in his emotional state, soon found himself wandering Midgard, lost and alone.

5598
04:52:48,320 --> 04:52:53,760
Sadly, he caught the eye of the one person he didn't want to meet alone that night.

5599
04:52:54,100 --> 04:52:55,640
So far from home.

5600
04:52:57,000 --> 04:52:57,560
Thor.

5601
04:52:58,400 --> 04:52:59,080
And?

5602
04:52:59,420 --> 04:53:00,140
What happened next?

5603
04:53:00,140 --> 04:53:00,440
Thor?

5604
04:53:00,960 --> 04:53:01,800
You'll see.

5605
04:53:05,200 --> 04:53:06,060
Oh my god.

5606
04:53:08,040 --> 04:53:09,300
Must meet Thor?

5607
04:53:12,140 --> 04:53:14,340
To be fair, we already met Thor earlier today.

5608
04:53:14,680 --> 04:53:16,340
We met countless Thors.

5609
04:53:17,660 --> 04:53:18,540
Oh, is this Yodaham?

5610
04:53:19,120 --> 04:53:20,360
I thought I did travel there.

5611
04:53:22,720 --> 04:53:23,900
Caesar Mountain.

5612
04:53:24,280 --> 04:53:25,140
Is this Yodaham?

5613
04:53:25,540 --> 04:53:26,220
No.

5614
04:53:26,720 --> 04:53:27,320
Are we there?

5615
04:53:31,040 --> 04:53:32,400
From Marvel Rivals?

5616
04:53:39,930 --> 04:53:40,610
Alright.

5617
04:53:42,970 --> 04:53:44,290
Open the portal.

5618
04:53:45,470 --> 04:53:47,730
Oh my god, what the fuck?

5619
04:53:51,180 --> 04:53:51,900
Where's that?

5620
04:53:57,320 --> 04:53:59,880
The fuck is this dead body in front of me?

5621
04:54:04,020 --> 04:54:04,940
Where is that?

5622
04:54:05,040 --> 04:54:05,720
Is that his hand?

5623
04:54:05,920 --> 04:54:07,120
Oh, that's his hand!

5624
04:54:11,060 --> 04:54:11,500
Alright.

5625
04:54:12,040 --> 04:54:13,400
Oh wait, I need to take my axe out.

5626
04:54:14,700 --> 04:54:15,240
What did I do?

5627
04:54:15,800 --> 04:54:17,760
Oh, he's like, he's green.

5628
04:54:17,840 --> 04:54:18,540
I can take him.

5629
04:54:19,500 --> 04:54:20,620
I can take him.

5630
04:54:21,260 --> 04:54:22,640
Oh boy, do your thing.

5631
04:54:22,780 --> 04:54:24,540
And then I'll do my...

5632
04:54:25,920 --> 04:54:26,280
ability.

5633
04:54:26,520 --> 04:54:27,340
That's right, spin!

5634
04:54:28,900 --> 04:54:30,000
And then ice!

5635
04:54:31,220 --> 04:54:32,340
And then do your thing again!

5636
04:54:32,940 --> 04:54:34,740
That's fucking right, what is he gonna do?

5637
04:54:34,840 --> 04:54:35,740
Fucking stab me?

5638
04:54:35,920 --> 04:54:37,100
Oh yeah, that's right.

5639
04:54:37,920 --> 04:54:39,060
You gotta do jack shit.

5640
04:54:40,540 --> 04:54:41,300
Alright, what did I see?

5641
04:54:41,500 --> 04:54:41,860
Wolvers.

5642
04:54:43,300 --> 04:54:45,760
Encounter more of these cursed werebeasts.

5643
04:54:45,860 --> 04:54:47,280
Oh, they're just like little werewolves.

5644
04:54:47,580 --> 04:54:48,540
Oh shit, there's more?!

5645
04:54:49,840 --> 04:54:50,700
I thought that was it!

5646
04:54:51,440 --> 04:54:52,840
Boy, I need you to do your shit.

5647
04:54:54,300 --> 04:54:55,220
Oh shit, boy!

5648
04:54:55,600 --> 04:54:56,120
Boy, please!

5649
04:54:56,280 --> 04:54:56,520
Boy!

5650
04:54:57,000 --> 04:54:58,980
Boy, you're not supposed to let him hit me, boy!

5651
04:55:00,760 --> 04:55:01,360
That's fine.

5652
04:55:01,840 --> 04:55:03,260
I don't need your help.

5653
04:55:04,540 --> 04:55:07,440
But what was the point of upgrading you if you don't help me?

5654
04:55:09,660 --> 04:55:10,480
Alright, nice.

5655
04:55:11,240 --> 04:55:12,040
Heavy attack.

5656
04:55:12,740 --> 04:55:13,140
Boop.

5657
04:55:14,460 --> 04:55:16,780
Alright, and then medium attack, and then heavy attack.

5658
04:55:17,540 --> 04:55:17,940
Nice.

5659
04:55:20,540 --> 04:55:20,940
Nice.

5660
04:55:21,620 --> 04:55:22,400
We did it.

5661
04:55:22,460 --> 04:55:22,780
Oh shit.

5662
04:55:23,640 --> 04:55:23,900
Oops.

5663
04:55:25,440 --> 04:55:26,060
Wrong thing.

5664
04:55:26,140 --> 04:55:28,360
I saw blue and I was like, is that for me?

5665
04:55:29,240 --> 04:55:30,340
Is that for me?

5666
04:55:31,540 --> 04:55:32,740
Wait, is that another thing?

5667
04:55:33,020 --> 04:55:33,840
I thought that looked the same.

5668
04:55:33,900 --> 04:55:36,200
Oh, they look like wolves but they stand upright.

5669
04:55:36,420 --> 04:55:37,700
Oh, so they're like werewolves.

5670
04:55:38,000 --> 04:55:40,540
Oh, they're like Norse werewolves.

5671
04:55:40,540 --> 04:55:42,360
Norwegian werewolves.

5672
04:55:43,180 --> 04:55:44,020
Yoink mine now.

5673
04:55:46,140 --> 04:55:46,860
Shoot.

5674
04:55:47,780 --> 04:55:48,500
Shoot.

5675
04:55:49,060 --> 04:55:49,780
Yay!

5676
04:55:52,360 --> 04:55:53,400
What did I do with that?

5677
04:55:56,300 --> 04:55:56,660
Yeah.

5678
04:55:57,140 --> 04:55:58,340
That was useless.

5679
04:55:58,760 --> 04:55:59,400
What happened?

5680
04:56:00,660 --> 04:56:02,380
Oh wait, I can blow it up again.

5681
04:56:06,880 --> 04:56:07,980
I blow up again?

5682
04:56:11,500 --> 04:56:12,400
Wait, what?

5683
04:56:18,040 --> 04:56:18,520
Oh!

5684
04:56:20,920 --> 04:56:22,300
God, I'm so smart.

5685
04:56:23,220 --> 04:56:24,440
Alright, blow it up boy.

5686
04:56:25,840 --> 04:56:26,800
Good job.

5687
04:56:28,380 --> 04:56:29,040
That's right.

5688
04:56:30,580 --> 04:56:32,700
Now you can sleep on a bed tonight.

5689
04:56:34,020 --> 04:56:34,880
Is there another thing?

5690
04:56:34,960 --> 04:56:35,820
Oh, there was another one.

5691
04:56:36,460 --> 04:56:37,320
I'll move this way.

5692
04:56:38,860 --> 04:56:42,020
Oh my gosh, she's actually playing God of War.

5693
04:56:43,540 --> 04:56:45,900
What's that supposed to mean guys?

5694
04:56:46,360 --> 04:56:48,480
My thumbnail said God of War.

5695
04:56:48,640 --> 04:56:50,860
You thought I would lie about it guys?

5696
04:56:51,120 --> 04:56:52,680
I would never.

5697
04:56:56,020 --> 04:56:56,540
Me?

5698
04:56:56,840 --> 04:56:58,780
Lie about playing God of War?

5699
04:56:59,000 --> 04:56:59,980
I told you.

5700
04:57:00,620 --> 04:57:01,780
You guys didn't believe in me.

5701
04:57:05,680 --> 04:57:06,860
I open it like this?

5702
04:57:07,820 --> 04:57:09,120
Oh, I have to go the other way.

5703
04:57:09,200 --> 04:57:09,420
Okay.

5704
04:57:09,420 --> 04:57:11,960
Let me grab these real quick.

5705
04:57:12,780 --> 04:57:16,900
Alright, let's go downstairs.

5706
04:57:17,840 --> 04:57:18,200
Alright, boy.

5707
04:57:24,460 --> 04:57:25,420
Okay.

5708
04:57:32,080 --> 04:57:32,940
See?

5709
04:57:34,140 --> 04:57:36,120
That's magic for pussies.

5710
04:57:37,220 --> 04:57:39,940
Boy, you ain't no magic son of mine.

5711
04:57:42,180 --> 04:57:43,580
How do I get out of here?

5712
04:57:46,060 --> 04:57:46,680
The fuck?

5713
04:57:48,440 --> 04:57:48,960
Boy!

5714
04:57:50,480 --> 04:57:51,000
How?

5715
04:57:53,080 --> 04:57:53,600
Oh.

5716
04:57:53,980 --> 04:57:54,380
It's okay.

5717
04:57:54,980 --> 04:57:55,940
I don't need your help, boy.

5718
04:57:56,840 --> 04:57:57,800
I did it.

5719
04:57:58,740 --> 04:57:59,400
I have my trustees.

5720
04:58:01,600 --> 04:58:02,740
I have my trustees.

5721
04:58:02,740 --> 04:58:03,040
Trustees.

5722
04:58:05,140 --> 04:58:06,460
There's no way.

5723
04:58:07,060 --> 04:58:08,660
One of them has to be fake.

5724
04:58:10,340 --> 04:58:11,480
Alright, great robbing.

5725
04:58:11,640 --> 04:58:12,060
Yeah!

5726
04:58:13,000 --> 04:58:14,140
Taking you back to England.

5727
04:58:14,700 --> 04:58:15,380
Let's go.

5728
04:58:17,640 --> 04:58:19,200
Oh, rare chest armor.

5729
04:58:19,580 --> 04:58:20,320
That's good.

5730
04:58:21,360 --> 04:58:22,060
Boy, explain.

5731
04:58:22,680 --> 04:58:23,740
Explain to me.

5732
04:58:24,200 --> 04:58:24,960
Like it's Marvel.

5733
04:58:25,280 --> 04:58:25,980
I'm sorry.

5734
04:58:29,320 --> 04:58:30,640
Oh, there's Zed.

5735
04:58:40,400 --> 04:58:41,400
Guys, I'm illiterate.

5736
04:58:41,480 --> 04:58:42,700
That's why I make my boy read.

5737
04:58:43,760 --> 04:58:46,740
Why would I need to learn how to read when my boy can do it for me?

5738
04:58:48,140 --> 04:58:48,900
Alright, give me a sec.

5739
04:58:49,020 --> 04:58:49,880
Okay, I can't.

5740
04:58:52,260 --> 04:58:53,080
Alright, get over here.

5741
04:58:53,720 --> 04:58:54,420
Oh, okay.

5742
04:58:56,440 --> 04:58:57,020
Invulnerability dodge.

5743
04:58:57,560 --> 04:58:58,580
That was pretty sick, though.

5744
04:58:58,620 --> 04:58:59,020
You gotta admit.

5745
04:58:59,880 --> 04:59:00,560
You gotta admit.

5746
04:59:02,820 --> 04:59:03,460
I missed.

5747
04:59:07,780 --> 04:59:11,820
Guys, it's the effort, okay?

5748
04:59:13,500 --> 04:59:19,220
I think the effort I tried and that's all that matters.

5749
04:59:21,100 --> 04:59:21,800
Oh, wait, he's bigger.

5750
04:59:23,640 --> 04:59:24,400
That's fine.

5751
04:59:24,520 --> 04:59:25,680
I can take him on.

5752
04:59:27,380 --> 04:59:28,740
I can take him on.

5753
04:59:28,800 --> 04:59:29,100
You know what?

5754
04:59:29,760 --> 04:59:30,920
Oh, shit!

5755
04:59:31,800 --> 04:59:32,620
Oh, okay.

5756
04:59:32,860 --> 04:59:35,460
I didn't think you would dodge that.

5757
04:59:37,120 --> 04:59:39,620
Oh my god, you are smart enough to dodge.

5758
04:59:41,940 --> 04:59:42,860
Oh, shit.

5759
04:59:43,860 --> 04:59:44,640
Come on, get over here.

5760
04:59:45,920 --> 04:59:47,260
Come on, get over here.

5761
04:59:47,820 --> 04:59:49,140
Yeah, you think you can run?

5762
04:59:50,160 --> 04:59:51,460
That's fucking right.

5763
04:59:53,160 --> 04:59:53,640
2v1.

5764
04:59:53,960 --> 04:59:54,740
So fair.

5765
04:59:57,940 --> 04:59:59,340
Wait, that's another type?

5766
05:00:01,720 --> 05:00:04,280
Oh, it's like extra lore.

5767
05:00:07,120 --> 05:00:08,920
Alright, free robbing.

5768
05:00:10,760 --> 05:00:11,360
Yeah!

5769
05:00:13,160 --> 05:00:15,180
Guys, did we ever ban them?

5770
05:00:15,980 --> 05:00:16,880
Did my mods ban them?

5771
05:00:19,740 --> 05:00:22,460
Did we actually, guys, did we ban them?

5772
05:00:25,480 --> 05:00:27,140
I was thinking about it.

5773
05:00:27,140 --> 05:00:29,020
I was like, I wonder if they're free.

5774
05:00:29,020 --> 05:00:30,980
Wait, no!

5775
05:00:33,480 --> 05:00:34,360
Oh,

5776
05:00:49,900 --> 05:00:50,380
you guys!

5777
05:00:50,560 --> 05:00:52,720
You guys timed him up!

5778
05:00:53,180 --> 05:00:53,760
You guys!

5779
05:00:54,100 --> 05:00:55,640
Oh my god.

5780
05:00:57,140 --> 05:00:58,020
Weak.

5781
05:00:58,660 --> 05:01:00,320
You thought I would...

5782
05:01:00,320 --> 05:01:01,520
Oh my god, what?

5783
05:01:01,960 --> 05:01:03,340
Wait, okay, I had to aim, right?

5784
05:01:06,080 --> 05:01:08,020
Wait, you just...

5785
05:01:09,120 --> 05:01:10,460
Fucking blocked that.

5786
05:01:10,880 --> 05:01:12,240
Like a little bitch.

5787
05:01:16,180 --> 05:01:19,220
Why did you let him do that to me, boy?!

5788
05:01:19,220 --> 05:01:20,760
That's it, I'm fucking mad.

5789
05:01:21,480 --> 05:01:22,640
I'm fucking mad.

5790
05:01:22,800 --> 05:01:23,720
I don't care.

5791
05:01:24,020 --> 05:01:25,140
I'm just gonna...

5792
05:01:25,140 --> 05:01:26,740
I'm punching ice.

5793
05:01:26,740 --> 05:01:28,400
I'm gonna punch ice.

5794
05:01:28,680 --> 05:01:29,880
And it's doing nothing.

5795
05:01:30,100 --> 05:01:30,400
Alright.

5796
05:01:30,680 --> 05:01:31,340
That's cool.

5797
05:01:31,800 --> 05:01:33,300
Guys, the ice does nothing.

5798
05:01:36,500 --> 05:01:37,860
It doesn't...

5799
05:01:41,140 --> 05:01:42,860
Oh my god.

5800
05:01:43,040 --> 05:01:44,760
Oh my god, I'm so weak, boy.

5801
05:01:46,100 --> 05:01:46,780
Boy.

5802
05:01:48,460 --> 05:01:50,360
I feel so weak.

5803
05:01:51,440 --> 05:01:52,500
Oh, boy!

5804
05:01:53,500 --> 05:01:55,580
Boy, I feel so weak, boy.

5805
05:02:00,790 --> 05:02:03,350
Oh, that's what it was for.

5806
05:02:03,910 --> 05:02:04,510
Oh!

5807
05:02:05,130 --> 05:02:06,270
I'm dumb.

5808
05:02:07,210 --> 05:02:08,830
I'm so dumb.

5809
05:02:09,870 --> 05:02:11,090
Oh my god.

5810
05:02:11,470 --> 05:02:12,450
I was like...

5811
05:02:12,450 --> 05:02:14,350
I was like, where is he dropping?

5812
05:02:15,090 --> 05:02:15,890
Oh my god.

5813
05:02:15,970 --> 05:02:17,930
I could've finished this a long time ago, guys.

5814
05:02:18,810 --> 05:02:19,410
I...

5815
05:02:21,850 --> 05:02:25,270
Alright, now I know.

5816
05:02:25,950 --> 05:02:26,770
Now I know.

5817
05:02:26,910 --> 05:02:28,450
I was like wondering where he was dropping.

5818
05:02:29,650 --> 05:02:31,370
Oh, I should've saved that, though.

5819
05:02:32,330 --> 05:02:33,990
I should've saved that.

5820
05:02:35,830 --> 05:02:37,330
Gotta open this first.

5821
05:02:40,230 --> 05:02:42,730
How do I activate the...

5822
05:02:43,270 --> 05:02:44,370
the ice giant?

5823
05:02:46,250 --> 05:02:47,030
Is it here?

5824
05:02:48,310 --> 05:02:49,230
That's here, right?

5825
05:02:49,330 --> 05:02:50,770
Oh, let me grab the stuff, then.

5826
05:02:56,150 --> 05:02:57,670
Yeah, where is the crystal?

5827
05:03:00,430 --> 05:03:01,050
Oh!

5828
05:03:07,220 --> 05:03:08,940
How did I activate it?

5829
05:03:09,160 --> 05:03:10,080
Where was I?

5830
05:03:11,580 --> 05:03:14,280
Where was I when I activated it?

5831
05:03:17,060 --> 05:03:17,780
Wait, what?

5832
05:03:20,060 --> 05:03:23,040
I don't remember where I was to activate this guy.

5833
05:03:29,860 --> 05:03:31,420
No, that's his face?

5834
05:03:31,420 --> 05:03:33,440
How do I activate it?

5835
05:03:35,820 --> 05:03:38,740
How the fuck did I start the thing?

5836
05:03:40,400 --> 05:03:41,600
Ah, fuck, who cares.

5837
05:03:49,220 --> 05:03:49,560
Huh?

5838
05:03:51,040 --> 05:03:52,140
What is that?

5839
05:03:52,560 --> 05:03:53,300
Oh, it's a boat.

5840
05:03:54,080 --> 05:03:57,000
Oh, I accidentally smacked him?

5841
05:03:57,540 --> 05:03:59,120
Oh my god!

5842
05:03:59,120 --> 05:04:01,360
When did I smack him?

5843
05:04:03,060 --> 05:04:06,560
I didn't even know I accidentally smacked the guy.

5844
05:04:07,040 --> 05:04:08,040
Whoops.

5845
05:04:09,280 --> 05:04:11,880
That's my bad, actually.

5846
05:04:14,680 --> 05:04:15,880
That's my bad.

5847
05:04:16,520 --> 05:04:18,920
That's my...

5848
05:04:23,400 --> 05:04:24,400
Okay.

5849
05:04:25,920 --> 05:04:27,120
That's fucking right.

5850
05:04:27,120 --> 05:04:29,120
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

5851
05:04:30,420 --> 05:04:31,190
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

5852
05:04:32,100 --> 05:04:32,820
There we go.

5853
05:04:37,360 --> 05:04:37,980
No!

5854
05:04:38,380 --> 05:04:38,820
No!

5855
05:04:45,700 --> 05:04:46,580
There we go.

5856
05:04:47,220 --> 05:04:48,280
Ah, fuck, okay.

5857
05:04:51,120 --> 05:04:52,680
Oh my god.

5858
05:04:52,760 --> 05:04:54,380
Alright, this is gonna take a while.

5859
05:04:55,040 --> 05:04:57,040
This is gonna... I fumbled so much.

5860
05:04:57,600 --> 05:04:57,900
No!

5861
05:04:59,660 --> 05:05:00,280
Alright.

5862
05:05:01,100 --> 05:05:01,660
No!

5863
05:05:01,660 --> 05:05:03,680
No way!

5864
05:05:05,720 --> 05:05:06,820
Fuck you!

5865
05:05:07,540 --> 05:05:09,060
Are you serious?

5866
05:05:11,320 --> 05:05:12,420
Oh my god.

5867
05:05:12,980 --> 05:05:15,140
Oh my god, what the fuck?

5868
05:05:15,320 --> 05:05:17,400
Why are they so...

5869
05:05:17,400 --> 05:05:18,880
Why are they so strong?

5870
05:05:18,880 --> 05:05:20,620
I'm gonna smack it until I... Okay.

5871
05:05:21,840 --> 05:05:22,300
Smack!

5872
05:05:23,560 --> 05:05:24,840
I figured it out.

5873
05:05:26,220 --> 05:05:27,760
Come on, look at me.

5874
05:05:28,220 --> 05:05:29,020
Look at me!

5875
05:05:29,980 --> 05:05:31,340
Look at me!

5876
05:05:31,660 --> 05:05:31,800
Oh!

5877
05:05:32,100 --> 05:05:33,360
Okay, not like that though.

5878
05:05:38,920 --> 05:05:40,440
I have a shield.

5879
05:05:47,220 --> 05:05:47,940
Guys.

5880
05:05:48,640 --> 05:05:50,420
I have a shield.

5881
05:05:51,500 --> 05:05:51,880
No!

5882
05:05:55,440 --> 05:05:58,960
I just remembered I had a shield.

5883
05:05:58,960 --> 05:06:00,980
I just...

5884
05:06:03,640 --> 05:06:04,640
Okay.

5885
05:06:05,480 --> 05:06:08,320
That makes a lot more sense now.

5886
05:06:09,020 --> 05:06:10,000
Wait, what?

5887
05:06:20,470 --> 05:06:21,470
Okay.

5888
05:06:22,770 --> 05:06:24,210
Oh my god.

5889
05:06:26,010 --> 05:06:26,390
Give me.

5890
05:06:27,650 --> 05:06:28,130
There we go.

5891
05:06:30,450 --> 05:06:31,650
There we go.

5892
05:06:32,990 --> 05:06:33,850
There we go.

5893
05:06:33,850 --> 05:06:35,630
That's right!

5894
05:06:36,990 --> 05:06:38,830
That's fucking right!

5895
05:06:40,930 --> 05:06:41,990
Okay, guys.

5896
05:06:42,130 --> 05:06:43,550
Shields are not really for pussies, guys.

5897
05:06:43,690 --> 05:06:46,270
It's very situational, everybody.

5898
05:06:48,350 --> 05:06:51,390
Magic is for pussies.

5899
05:06:52,530 --> 05:06:54,170
I meant magic, guys.

5900
05:06:54,270 --> 05:06:58,410
Shields... Sometimes a real man's gotta use a shield sometimes.

5901
05:06:58,550 --> 05:06:59,450
It's not...

5902
05:06:59,450 --> 05:07:03,210
Sometimes a real man's gotta use a shield.

5903
05:07:03,470 --> 05:07:05,670
It can't all just be offensive.

5904
05:07:05,930 --> 05:07:08,910
We gotta be able to have a little bit of defense, guys.

5905
05:07:08,970 --> 05:07:10,030
Just a little bit.

5906
05:07:10,570 --> 05:07:11,090
There we go.

5907
05:07:11,150 --> 05:07:11,650
So easy.

5908
05:07:11,730 --> 05:07:12,650
Oh wait, what the fuck?

5909
05:07:13,950 --> 05:07:14,950
I have a rabbit on this guy.

5910
05:07:16,510 --> 05:07:17,250
There we go.

5911
05:07:20,850 --> 05:07:21,230
What?

5912
05:07:21,370 --> 05:07:23,210
Wait, there's still more?

5913
05:07:26,530 --> 05:07:27,550
Alright, there we go.

5914
05:07:27,550 --> 05:07:29,550
I did nothing.

5915
05:07:33,970 --> 05:07:35,190
Is that it?

5916
05:07:35,310 --> 05:07:35,630
No.

5917
05:07:36,830 --> 05:07:37,580
Wait, how do I...

5918
05:07:39,690 --> 05:07:40,890
Do that.

5919
05:07:41,250 --> 05:07:42,450
We got that.

5920
05:07:42,730 --> 05:07:43,750
Where's the other ones?

5921
05:07:48,010 --> 05:07:49,150
I feel like...

5922
05:07:49,150 --> 05:07:51,390
This is important too.

5923
05:07:52,330 --> 05:07:53,590
But I can't...

5924
05:07:54,350 --> 05:07:55,930
Oh wait, the tree!

5925
05:07:56,050 --> 05:07:56,410
The tree!

5926
05:07:59,590 --> 05:08:00,170
The sap!

5927
05:08:02,910 --> 05:08:03,930
Alright, let's go.

5928
05:08:04,330 --> 05:08:05,070
Let's do this.

5929
05:08:12,350 --> 05:08:13,470
That should work, right?

5930
05:08:17,850 --> 05:08:19,010
That should work, right?

5931
05:08:20,910 --> 05:08:21,390
What?

5932
05:08:23,490 --> 05:08:25,150
Is that not what I had to do?

5933
05:08:26,890 --> 05:08:27,810
But it's red!

5934
05:08:29,310 --> 05:08:30,450
I have red!

5935
05:08:35,440 --> 05:08:36,420
It's red.

5936
05:08:43,180 --> 05:08:44,560
Okay, alright.

5937
05:08:44,820 --> 05:08:46,680
Fuck me, I guess I have to just spam it.

5938
05:08:47,940 --> 05:08:48,460
Alright.

5939
05:08:49,960 --> 05:08:52,100
My boy is just a little weak, guys.

5940
05:08:52,280 --> 05:08:53,280
Please don't judge him.

5941
05:08:54,760 --> 05:08:57,240
He's just a little weak.

5942
05:08:58,200 --> 05:08:59,100
Don't judge him.

5943
05:08:59,120 --> 05:08:59,920
He's still learning.

5944
05:08:59,920 --> 05:09:00,080
He's still learning.

5945
05:09:02,180 --> 05:09:04,060
Wait, I'm trying to find the last one.

5946
05:09:05,060 --> 05:09:05,780
No, no, no.

5947
05:09:05,860 --> 05:09:06,480
It wasn't me.

5948
05:09:06,580 --> 05:09:07,240
It was my boy.

5949
05:09:09,860 --> 05:09:11,220
It wasn't me, guys.

5950
05:09:11,380 --> 05:09:12,520
It was my boy.

5951
05:09:13,580 --> 05:09:14,540
But it's okay.

5952
05:09:14,720 --> 05:09:16,120
I am a generous father.

5953
05:09:17,460 --> 05:09:18,280
Read, boy!

5954
05:09:20,240 --> 05:09:21,260
What does it say?

5955
05:09:36,040 --> 05:09:36,520
Okay.

5956
05:09:38,060 --> 05:09:38,360
Okay.

5957
05:09:38,360 --> 05:09:38,760
Wait, what?

5958
05:09:44,330 --> 05:09:45,550
Wait, but how do I get this?

5959
05:09:45,670 --> 05:09:46,490
Oh, boy!

5960
05:09:46,890 --> 05:09:47,570
No, boy!

5961
05:09:54,020 --> 05:09:54,500
Boom!

5962
05:09:56,100 --> 05:09:56,980
That should be it, right?

5963
05:10:00,520 --> 05:10:01,480
Did I get it?

5964
05:10:02,440 --> 05:10:03,740
It should be a W.

5965
05:10:06,320 --> 05:10:08,240
Oh, it's not a fucking W.

5966
05:10:08,240 --> 05:10:08,760
It's a...

5967
05:10:10,040 --> 05:10:10,460
Where?

5968
05:10:12,120 --> 05:10:13,600
What are you looking at?

5969
05:10:14,780 --> 05:10:15,760
What are you running at?

5970
05:10:18,000 --> 05:10:18,840
Where?

5971
05:10:22,240 --> 05:10:23,080
Okay.

5972
05:10:24,220 --> 05:10:25,220
Come on.

5973
05:10:25,940 --> 05:10:26,280
Oh!

5974
05:10:28,460 --> 05:10:29,300
No!

5975
05:10:36,160 --> 05:10:37,000
Yes!

5976
05:10:37,420 --> 05:10:38,360
That should be it!

5977
05:10:39,320 --> 05:10:41,320
That should be the right one!

5978
05:10:41,320 --> 05:10:44,240
Oh my god, I can't even do this anymore.

5979
05:10:44,700 --> 05:10:45,580
There we go.

5980
05:10:46,400 --> 05:10:47,540
It's a sideways W.

5981
05:10:50,580 --> 05:10:51,780
That should be it.

5982
05:10:52,960 --> 05:10:53,840
We did it.

5983
05:10:57,100 --> 05:10:58,320
I wasn't here.

5984
05:11:03,380 --> 05:11:03,940
Hello?

5985
05:11:04,920 --> 05:11:05,480
Whoa!

5986
05:11:07,500 --> 05:11:08,320
What did I get?

5987
05:11:09,100 --> 05:11:10,800
Oh, I get to increase damage.

5988
05:11:11,040 --> 05:11:12,220
Okay, we need that, actually.

5989
05:11:12,780 --> 05:11:14,320
It's actually really good for us.

5990
05:11:18,740 --> 05:11:20,580
Okay, now I'm a little...

5991
05:11:20,580 --> 05:11:23,140
He said he saw the crystal, but like...

5992
05:11:23,140 --> 05:11:24,580
I don't know where he saw it.

5993
05:11:26,460 --> 05:11:28,640
I came from...

5994
05:11:28,640 --> 05:11:30,500
Oh my god, where did I come from?

5995
05:11:31,260 --> 05:11:31,740
Wait a...

5996
05:11:31,740 --> 05:11:33,060
Oh, we're in.

5997
05:11:35,940 --> 05:11:37,040
I showed up here?

5998
05:11:37,840 --> 05:11:39,000
Yeah, yeah, I showed up here.

5999
05:11:39,720 --> 05:11:41,160
So then, it has to be at the head.

6000
05:11:47,510 --> 05:11:48,290
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6001
05:11:48,590 --> 05:11:50,210
So I should go this way then.

6002
05:11:54,400 --> 05:11:54,600
Alright.

6003
05:11:56,250 --> 05:11:57,100
Oh shit!

6004
05:11:57,440 --> 05:11:58,180
Oh shit!

6005
05:11:59,060 --> 05:12:01,000
Oh my god, they're so fucking weird.

6006
05:12:01,520 --> 05:12:02,580
That's it.

6007
05:12:02,740 --> 05:12:02,940
Alright.

6008
05:12:03,960 --> 05:12:05,780
Oh my god!

6009
05:12:06,560 --> 05:12:08,500
So scared!

6010
05:12:08,800 --> 05:12:10,410
I'm so scared.

6011
05:12:12,140 --> 05:12:13,480
Oh my god.

6012
05:12:14,180 --> 05:12:16,400
It's like swatting fucking flies there.

6013
05:12:20,740 --> 05:12:22,860
Head of Thamur.

6014
05:12:26,870 --> 05:12:27,330
Okay.

6015
05:12:28,010 --> 05:12:28,590
We cannot go there.

6016
05:12:35,180 --> 05:12:38,440
What do I do?

6017
05:12:43,940 --> 05:12:48,200
Oh, I see the crystals behind me.

6018
05:12:52,620 --> 05:12:55,120
Is that the crystal?

6019
05:13:00,900 --> 05:13:01,760
Oh my god, let's go!

6020
05:13:01,900 --> 05:13:02,780
Let's go, teamwork!

6021
05:13:05,020 --> 05:13:06,840
That's right, I'm angry now.

6022
05:13:07,320 --> 05:13:08,240
I'm fucking...

6023
05:13:08,240 --> 05:13:09,680
Oh, I'm fucking angry.

6024
05:13:10,540 --> 05:13:12,000
That's fucking...

6025
05:13:12,000 --> 05:13:12,980
That's right!

6026
05:13:13,440 --> 05:13:15,820
I don't need therapy!

6027
05:13:16,280 --> 05:13:19,300
You are my punching bags!

6028
05:13:20,880 --> 05:13:22,400
It's free!

6029
05:13:24,100 --> 05:13:28,480
Who needs therapy when I can play video games?

6030
05:13:31,660 --> 05:13:32,400
Alright, nice.

6031
05:13:35,420 --> 05:13:36,640
Okay, it's not free though.

6032
05:13:36,660 --> 05:13:37,800
This game was expensive.

6033
05:13:38,460 --> 05:13:39,040
I didn't buy it.

6034
05:13:39,100 --> 05:13:39,920
Wait, did I buy it during season?

6035
05:13:40,220 --> 05:13:42,780
JK, I bought it in the steam sale!

6036
05:13:43,640 --> 05:13:45,220
It's cheaper than therapy!

6037
05:13:50,680 --> 05:13:51,400
Alright, nice.

6038
05:13:52,440 --> 05:13:53,280
That should be all of them.

6039
05:13:56,660 --> 05:13:57,660
Oh shit, there's more!

6040
05:13:57,660 --> 05:13:59,640
Oh fuck, there's a lot more!

6041
05:14:01,940 --> 05:14:02,820
Oh my god!

6042
05:14:02,980 --> 05:14:04,900
He used them as a fucking...

6043
05:14:04,900 --> 05:14:06,020
Holy shit!

6044
05:14:08,720 --> 05:14:10,100
Oh my god, that's fucking crazy.

6045
05:14:11,360 --> 05:14:13,440
He just used them as like a prop.

6046
05:14:15,340 --> 05:14:17,280
They're not even on the same team anymore.

6047
05:14:18,120 --> 05:14:18,800
Get over here.

6048
05:14:19,160 --> 05:14:19,680
Get over here.

6049
05:14:20,080 --> 05:14:21,780
Oh my god, that wasn't the one I wanted.

6050
05:14:21,840 --> 05:14:23,000
Oh my god, let's all just fucking...

6051
05:14:23,000 --> 05:14:23,820
Let's all just brawl.

6052
05:14:24,040 --> 05:14:24,280
You know what?

6053
05:14:24,340 --> 05:14:24,700
Fuck it.

6054
05:14:24,700 --> 05:14:26,340
Fuck it, let's brawl.

6055
05:14:26,820 --> 05:14:28,820
Let's fucking brawl!

6056
05:14:30,680 --> 05:14:32,480
Let's fucking go!

6057
05:14:34,480 --> 05:14:36,560
Oh my god, I'm stuck in a corner.

6058
05:14:37,060 --> 05:14:38,600
Guys, I'm...

6059
05:14:38,600 --> 05:14:41,200
I'm... I'm stuck in a corner.

6060
05:14:41,360 --> 05:14:42,860
Let me... Let me go!

6061
05:14:47,600 --> 05:14:48,280
Please...

6062
05:14:48,280 --> 05:14:50,120
I can't... Where am I?

6063
05:14:50,120 --> 05:14:50,720
Where?

6064
05:14:52,860 --> 05:14:53,740
That's fine.

6065
05:14:54,660 --> 05:14:55,600
Oh yeah?

6066
05:14:55,820 --> 05:14:57,580
There's a lot of things on my right.

6067
05:14:59,320 --> 05:15:01,440
There's so many things.

6068
05:15:01,640 --> 05:15:01,840
Okay.

6069
05:15:04,300 --> 05:15:05,940
I'm just pressing buttons.

6070
05:15:06,080 --> 05:15:06,900
And it's working.

6071
05:15:08,000 --> 05:15:09,460
And it's fucking working.

6072
05:15:09,520 --> 05:15:10,080
That's right.

6073
05:15:11,640 --> 05:15:12,300
Nice.

6074
05:15:12,500 --> 05:15:13,200
That should be everybody.

6075
05:15:14,940 --> 05:15:15,840
That's right.

6076
05:15:16,680 --> 05:15:17,560
Brain damage!

6077
05:15:17,560 --> 05:15:18,200
Woo!

6078
05:15:19,780 --> 05:15:21,760
Oh, that's more than just a brain.

6079
05:15:23,400 --> 05:15:24,600
That's just damage.

6080
05:15:25,860 --> 05:15:26,680
You think so?

6081
05:15:27,920 --> 05:15:28,680
Oh.

6082
05:15:28,940 --> 05:15:29,940
Yep, definitely I did.

6083
05:15:31,680 --> 05:15:32,440
Nice.

6084
05:15:34,100 --> 05:15:34,860
Easy.

6085
05:15:35,860 --> 05:15:36,480
Can I...

6086
05:15:36,480 --> 05:15:38,300
Oh, the ogre.

6087
05:15:41,440 --> 05:15:42,200
Where?

6088
05:15:43,760 --> 05:15:45,180
Oh, there he is!

6089
05:15:46,060 --> 05:15:47,280
Wait, how did he get here?

6090
05:15:50,500 --> 05:15:50,880
Alright.

6091
05:15:51,120 --> 05:15:52,260
Can I actually not go back?

6092
05:15:52,520 --> 05:15:53,240
Oh, I can!

6093
05:15:54,380 --> 05:15:56,260
Alright, before we do it...

6094
05:15:56,260 --> 05:15:57,700
Apparently, I missed a crystal.

6095
05:16:02,040 --> 05:16:03,560
I missed a... Oh, there it is!

6096
05:16:03,680 --> 05:16:04,420
Oh, I see it!

6097
05:16:04,460 --> 05:16:05,320
It's right over there!

6098
05:16:06,560 --> 05:16:07,720
That's where it was.

6099
05:16:09,340 --> 05:16:11,040
What do I do with a crystal, though?

6100
05:16:13,500 --> 05:16:13,880
Boop!

6101
05:16:15,600 --> 05:16:16,300
Oh!

6102
05:16:17,140 --> 05:16:18,240
Oh!

6103
05:16:21,200 --> 05:16:22,600
Tree.

6104
05:16:24,020 --> 05:16:25,420
Alright.

6105
05:16:26,400 --> 05:16:26,960
Alright, boy.

6106
05:16:29,180 --> 05:16:31,100
Do your thing.

6107
05:16:31,960 --> 05:16:33,860
Boy, please.

6108
05:16:35,300 --> 05:16:36,360
Nice.

6109
05:16:38,940 --> 05:16:39,420
Yippee!

6110
05:16:41,380 --> 05:16:42,740
How do I... Okay.

6111
05:16:43,840 --> 05:16:45,000
Where do I put it?

6112
05:16:47,220 --> 05:16:48,060
Where's the thing?

6113
05:16:50,060 --> 05:16:51,260
Do your thing, boy!

6114
05:16:52,360 --> 05:16:55,120
Do the one thing that you're good for.

6115
05:16:58,300 --> 05:17:00,180
I don't know where I put this.

6116
05:17:01,700 --> 05:17:02,720
Oh, it's over here.

6117
05:17:02,820 --> 05:17:03,100
Okay.

6118
05:17:04,300 --> 05:17:05,340
What does it do?

6119
05:17:05,960 --> 05:17:07,240
What do I get out of it?

6120
05:17:09,720 --> 05:17:10,100
Boop!

6121
05:17:13,700 --> 05:17:14,220
Boy.

6122
05:17:16,540 --> 05:17:18,140
Oh, god fucking...

6123
05:17:23,240 --> 05:17:25,620
Isn't this basically a fucking...

6124
05:17:26,140 --> 05:17:27,040
I'm just fighting?

6125
05:17:28,500 --> 05:17:29,600
Oh, it's loot!

6126
05:17:29,960 --> 05:17:32,260
Oh, thank god!

6127
05:17:32,360 --> 05:17:33,720
Okay, you see... Oh, thank god.

6128
05:17:33,800 --> 05:17:36,660
Okay, I thought it was... I thought it was the fight.

6129
05:17:37,900 --> 05:17:41,860
Last time I stuck my hand through a hole, I died.

6130
05:17:41,920 --> 05:17:44,200
So, I was like...

6131
05:17:44,200 --> 05:17:45,680
I knew I died again.

6132
05:17:45,760 --> 05:17:48,200
I'm like, oh, thank god, it's different.

6133
05:17:48,540 --> 05:17:51,040
Now, it definitely keeps sticking my hands through holes.

6134
05:17:55,360 --> 05:17:56,980
Alright, up we go.

6135
05:18:01,730 --> 05:18:02,190
Alright.

6136
05:18:06,630 --> 05:18:09,390
Oh, you just watched?

6137
05:18:13,150 --> 05:18:14,550
Yeah.

6138
05:18:21,210 --> 05:18:25,390
How do you do it?

6139
05:18:25,970 --> 05:18:30,790
You mean use magic?

6140
05:18:34,510 --> 05:18:35,210
Oh?

6141
05:18:49,050 --> 05:18:50,090
Okay.

6142
05:18:51,090 --> 05:18:53,490
My boy does not use magic!

6143
05:18:54,930 --> 05:18:56,470
He is a man!

6144
05:19:01,630 --> 05:19:05,530
Nipples out for men.

6145
05:19:05,530 --> 05:19:05,730
Oh, man.

6146
05:19:13,150 --> 05:19:14,170
Oh, shit.

6147
05:19:14,250 --> 05:19:15,910
It looks like he's almost gonna cut himself.

6148
05:19:19,410 --> 05:19:20,370
For real.

6149
05:19:20,370 --> 05:19:21,310
Hahaha.

6150
05:19:29,070 --> 05:19:34,930
Oh, he's upgrading my axe again.

6151
05:19:37,530 --> 05:19:38,550
Wait, did he do it?

6152
05:19:39,950 --> 05:19:41,190
Oh, that was easy.

6153
05:19:41,410 --> 05:19:41,990
Hahaha.

6154
05:19:42,490 --> 05:19:43,090
Okay.

6155
05:19:43,730 --> 05:19:44,290
Wow.

6156
05:19:45,170 --> 05:19:45,770
See, boy?

6157
05:19:46,230 --> 05:19:48,030
This is why we don't use magic.

6158
05:19:48,030 --> 05:19:50,990
That was pathetic, boy.

6159
05:19:54,830 --> 05:19:56,270
Alright, guys.

6160
05:19:56,710 --> 05:19:58,910
We're gonna call it here, everybody.

6161
05:20:03,090 --> 05:20:09,670
We're gonna call it here, guys.

6162
05:20:10,090 --> 05:20:11,350
How do I save my game?

6163
05:20:13,610 --> 05:20:15,030
Wait, what?

6164
05:20:15,030 --> 05:20:16,030
What do you mean?

6165
05:20:16,310 --> 05:20:18,790
What do you mean you're gonna call it here?

6166
05:20:19,110 --> 05:20:20,210
Alright, guys.

6167
05:20:20,450 --> 05:20:21,790
We did it.

6168
05:20:23,090 --> 05:20:28,550
Yeah, we did five hours of God of War, everybody.

6169
05:20:32,950 --> 05:20:35,510
We fucking did it, guys.

6170
05:20:35,710 --> 05:20:36,730
I'm so proud of us.

6171
05:20:36,750 --> 05:20:38,330
We made so much progress.

6172
05:20:38,750 --> 05:20:40,150
We played the game!

6173
05:20:40,150 --> 05:20:40,790
We played the game!

6174
05:20:44,190 --> 05:20:44,790
Oh, man.

6175
05:20:44,870 --> 05:20:45,630
I'm so tired.

6176
05:20:45,810 --> 05:20:47,970
I'm gonna take a nap right after.

6177
05:20:48,130 --> 05:20:48,970
I know it's so boring.

6178
05:20:49,470 --> 05:20:49,790
Oh, yeah.

6179
05:20:49,850 --> 05:20:50,830
I got mod people.

6180
05:20:51,030 --> 05:20:52,150
It was two people, right?

6181
05:20:52,470 --> 05:20:53,450
I'm sorry, bro.

6182
05:20:54,170 --> 05:20:55,510
You've had your fun.

6183
05:20:56,570 --> 05:20:57,450
You've had...

6184
05:20:57,450 --> 05:21:01,030
Wait, did the other mod fucking left?

6185
05:21:02,450 --> 05:21:03,590
Where are you?

6186
05:21:03,850 --> 05:21:04,430
Oh, no.

6187
05:21:04,570 --> 05:21:06,090
Wait, is the other mod still here?

6188
05:21:06,690 --> 05:21:07,370
Oh, no.

6189
05:21:07,490 --> 05:21:07,630
Wait.

6190
05:21:07,630 --> 05:21:12,410
I need them to chat so I can remove their mod.

6191
05:21:16,290 --> 05:21:17,230
Oh, no.

6192
05:21:17,610 --> 05:21:18,690
They left.

6193
05:21:18,950 --> 05:21:19,890
Oh, no.

6194
05:21:20,090 --> 05:21:20,770
I need them.

6195
05:21:21,050 --> 05:21:25,810
When the chat history is back up, I'll remove their mod.

6196
05:21:26,130 --> 05:21:27,150
I need them to chat.

6197
05:21:27,390 --> 05:21:30,650
As long as they don't have Silent in their name, I know they're not mod.

6198
05:21:30,850 --> 05:21:31,950
That's how I do it.

6199
05:21:32,050 --> 05:21:34,650
If they don't have Silent in their name, they're not a mod.

6200
05:21:37,630 --> 05:21:39,230
What a crazy day.

6201
05:21:39,690 --> 05:21:40,910
Oh, I told you.

6202
05:21:40,990 --> 05:21:41,730
I didn't lie.

6203
05:21:41,910 --> 05:21:43,190
I did came back with the milk.

6204
05:21:43,250 --> 05:21:45,730
I told you we were gonna do God of War, guys.

6205
05:21:45,970 --> 05:21:49,250
I told you, chat.

6206
05:21:50,970 --> 05:21:52,650
I didn't lie about it.

6207
05:21:52,690 --> 05:21:54,050
We did play God of War.

6208
05:21:58,530 --> 05:21:59,530
Anyway, guys.

6209
05:22:00,950 --> 05:22:03,510
Thank you, everybody, for...

6210
05:22:04,250 --> 05:22:05,250
for coming.

6211
05:22:05,250 --> 05:22:07,110
I had a great time today.

6212
05:22:07,290 --> 05:22:09,910
I'm glad we're finally back at God of War.

6213
05:22:10,230 --> 05:22:13,290
After four months, we're finally back playing God of War.

6214
05:22:15,130 --> 05:22:16,250
It was...

6215
05:22:16,250 --> 05:22:19,730
I think I blanked out in the first three hours.

6216
05:22:20,090 --> 05:22:23,270
I blanked out in the first three hours of that stream.

6217
05:22:23,630 --> 05:22:26,550
So I'm pretty sure we made a lot of progress in God of War.

6218
05:22:26,690 --> 05:22:29,450
Because that was five hours of just playing God of War.

6219
05:22:30,190 --> 05:22:30,750
So...

6220
05:22:30,750 --> 05:22:35,630
I was perfectly mentally okay throughout all those five hours.

6221
05:22:36,230 --> 05:22:36,750
Anyway, guys.

6222
05:22:37,410 --> 05:22:40,030
As always, everybody, stay hydrated.

6223
05:22:40,450 --> 05:22:41,010
Posture check.

6224
05:22:41,330 --> 05:22:43,470
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

6225
05:22:43,630 --> 05:22:45,990
And if you stayed up for me, head to bed.

6226
05:22:46,430 --> 05:22:46,850
Because...

6227
05:22:46,850 --> 05:22:47,510
Oh, there you go.

6228
05:22:47,530 --> 05:22:47,910
You talked.

6229
05:22:48,030 --> 05:22:48,230
Okay.

6230
05:22:48,530 --> 05:22:49,050
Mod gone.

6231
05:22:51,490 --> 05:22:53,270
As always, everybody, stay hydrated.

6232
05:22:53,430 --> 05:22:53,830
Posture check.

6233
05:22:53,910 --> 05:22:55,290
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

6234
05:22:55,510 --> 05:22:57,130
If you stayed up for me, head to bed.

6235
05:22:57,210 --> 05:22:58,610
Because you deserve it.

6236
05:22:58,830 --> 05:23:00,230
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

6237
05:23:00,230 --> 05:23:01,490
Bye, guys.

6238
05:23:01,730 --> 05:23:02,250
Bye!
