1
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,500
Oh, hello everybody!

2
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:50,640
Oh my god, this game is so fucking loud.

3
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:51,280
Give me a second.

4
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,260
Give me a fucking second.

5
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:54,400
Oh, I'm angry.

6
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:57,700
I'm sorry.

7
00:01:58,180 --> 00:01:58,940
I'm so...

8
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:00,660
Today was awful today.

9
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,500
At least I'm a lot better now.

10
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,260
Like, I'm not coughing as much anymore.

11
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,360
Thank fucking god.

12
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,380
Um, let me... Oh my gosh.

13
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:09,960
I'm like...

14
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,060
This game is so loud.

15
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:11,880
I'm not gonna...

16
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:15,580
Alright.

17
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:16,380
Alright, story time.

18
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:17,760
Story time.

19
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:19,700
Okay, so... Yes, I was...

20
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:20,220
I forgot.

21
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:21,140
Okay, so...

22
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:22,120
I'm so sorry.

23
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,520
I'm so sorry.

24
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,140
I wanted to relax today.

25
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,060
Cause, you know, they were doing like a schedule.

26
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,680
Like, um, power...

27
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:34,860
Electrical maintenance shit.

28
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,920
I think they were checking up on the other stuff that happened after the flood.

29
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:42,080
So they were like, you guys are not gonna have power for today.

30
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:43,040
And I was like...

31
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:46,280
That's like... There's no warning?

32
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,520
No warning at all?

33
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:49,520
So I was like, you know what?

34
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:51,320
I'm gonna go to the fucking...

35
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,420
I'm gonna go to the mall.

36
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:55,660
I haven't been there for like two years.

37
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,640
I'm gonna do it.

38
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:57,680
I was like, you know what?

39
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,180
I'm gonna treat myself.

40
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:01,460
I'm gonna...

41
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:04,000
I was like, I'm not gonna have any internet.

42
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,320
I'm not gonna have any internet.

43
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,340
I'm not gonna have any power.

44
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:07,980
I'm gonna fucking... I'm gonna treat myself.

45
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:08,360
I'm gonna...

46
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,080
I'm gonna go to this really nice, fancy mall.

47
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:13,920
That I haven't been there in two years.

48
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,340
They have the best crepes.

49
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,560
They have this place for crepes.

50
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,060
And I'm gonna get myself a crepe.

51
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,940
It's just a 20 minute...

52
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:23,380
Also, another reason why is that the mall is like 20 minutes away.

53
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,120
So I was like, I'm gonna do it.

54
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,140
I'm gonna take an Uber.

55
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:27,120
I'm gonna splurge.

56
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:28,540
I'm gonna get an Uber.

57
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:29,620
I'm gonna go to that mall.

58
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:31,280
I'm gonna get myself some fucking crepes!

59
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:36,460
And then, first off, they didn't have crepes.

60
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,020
I've been gone for two years.

61
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,760
I haven't been there for two years.

62
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:47,100
And who would've thought the crepe place went out of business.

63
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:57,240
The crepe place went out of business.

64
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:00,000
So instead, I got ice cream.

65
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:01,500
I- I got ice cream.

66
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,160
You didn't check?

67
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:10,820
I don't even remember like...

68
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:32,960
This place had the best crepes Clearly, not good enough because it went fucking out of business but back then It- I was- I'm gonna say that place, that crepe place has been there for ten years In the last two years I didn't go, it went out of business.

69
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:35,800
What happened two years ago?

70
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,540
Oh, COVID.

71
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,540
Goddamn COVID!

72
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,680
My crepes!

73
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,560
Why did people buy crepes during COVID?

74
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,860
I don't understand.

75
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:06,600
The crepe place has been there for 10 years!

76
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:10,740
Why couldn't people buy dessert during COVID?

77
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:12,360
Like, why?

78
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,640
They relied on you, Doki.

79
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,360
You didn't go and support them when they needed them.

80
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:26,760
How was I supposed to know they would just disappear?

81
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,260
They would just be gone?

82
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:32,170
How was I supposed to know that?

83
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,500
Also, thank you for the magenta soup.

84
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:36,580
Thank you, thank you.

85
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:38,660
Anyone else ready for some anime?

86
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:42,820
Thank you.

87
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:45,920
Anyway, so yeah, I was super hyped.

88
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,300
I was like, I'm gonna go to this mall.

89
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,680
I haven't been there for two years.

90
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,900
It's only a 20-minute Uber ride.

91
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:54,980
Um, they have the fucking, they have a really good crepe store.

92
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,780
I'm fucking craving some crepes right now.

93
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:59,940
And I was like, oh, I'm so excited.

94
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,420
And I went there.

95
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,880
There was, there was no crepes, but it was fine.

96
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:05,960
I still explored the mall.

97
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,580
And I was like, wow, I have 40 minutes to come back before my stream.

98
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:15,660
So then I was like, the power said, the power schedule said it will be back up before then.

99
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,900
So like, it should be fine.

100
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,180
I ordered my Uber to come home.

101
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,400
It was...

102
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,680
Four, it was four.

103
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,020
I took the Uber at 4 10.

104
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:29,900
Because I was like, well, it took 20 minutes to get back.

105
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:32,900
So 4 10 is the perfect amount of time.

106
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,820
I forgot, I would...

107
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:38,020
I forgot people have real lives, chat.

108
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:41,720
I legitimately forgot like, what the real world was like.

109
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,080
I was like, what's the worst that could happen?

110
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:51,580
I was stuck in traffic for one hour, chat.

111
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:56,020
For one entire hour, I was in that fucking Uber.

112
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:02,680
I was like, why is there traffic?

113
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,760
And then I was like, oh yeah, people have jobs.

114
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:10,660
They say nine to five.

115
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:13,020
I thought they would get off at five.

116
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:16,180
What do you mean they get off at four?

117
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:19,740
I thought nine to five means exactly at nine.

118
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:21,880
What kind of... it's not nine to four.

119
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,860
Everybody says nine to five.

120
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,340
So like, what, why are they out now?

121
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:28,320
Why are students coming out now?

122
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,240
It's not students go home at three.

123
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:32,100
Why are people still driving?

124
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,880
There is a seven to four shift, Stokie.

125
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,080
Who fucking works seven to four?

126
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,820
Who works seven to four in my chat?

127
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:46,000
My nine to five lets me off at six.

128
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:47,280
Eight to four.

129
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:49,240
Who says eight to four?

130
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:53,440
I've never heard people say eight to four, but me.

131
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:56,980
You are the problem why I was late.

132
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:58,500
You are not joking.

133
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:00,460
I'm not joking.

134
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:04,380
Anyway, anyway.

135
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:08,920
So the day I decided to like go out.

136
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,120
Anyway, also like here's another lesson.

137
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:13,940
Going outside was a fucking mistake as a streamer.

138
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:16,100
Because I forgot what the real world was like.

139
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:21,420
Because I've been stuck in this like hyperbolic time chamber of like being a streamer.

140
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:25,260
And so like I forgot what people in the real world do these days.

141
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:28,460
Like I legitimately forgot rush hour was a thing.

142
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,940
Like, because I was like, why?

143
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:32,820
I was like, because I was looking at my google maps.

144
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:33,800
I was like, oh my god.

145
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:35,480
There's so many car crashes.

146
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:38,840
Because there's like reds everywhere on the google map.

147
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:41,440
So I was just like, what does that mean?

148
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:45,480
And I was like, wow, there's so many car crashes here on the road back.

149
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,940
And I was like, wait, it's just regular traffic.

150
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:50,300
And I was like, oh my god.

151
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:53,720
Oh, yeah, people have to go home.

152
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:58,940
I was like, why is there like three to four car crashes?

153
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,040
Like on google maps.

154
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,280
And I was like, oh, yeah.

155
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,320
People go home at this hour.

156
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,840
Chronically online.

157
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:21,660
So, so like going outside as a, as a streamer was a fucking mistake.

158
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:23,960
Because I forgot what the real world was like.

159
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:26,660
And because, and this is why I was late.

160
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:29,320
I legitimately was like, wow, 4 10.

161
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:31,260
Plenty of time to go home.

162
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:32,760
One hour.

163
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:36,860
I hate, okay, like being stuck in a car for one hour.

164
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:41,860
I was just, I, and it sucks because like, um, my, I get car sickness on and off.

165
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:51,480
Um, I get like, so like sometimes like if I'm in a small enough car, like if the car is small enough, like I get car sickness because like it's too small.

166
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,160
So it's like extra bumpy.

167
00:09:53,400 --> 00:10:00,240
So like it's just not, and then like, you know, like when you're in stuck in traffic, it's like go stop, go stop, go stop.

168
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,560
So I couldn't like use my phone too much.

169
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,920
Because we're always like go stop, go stop.

170
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:06,940
So it's always moving.

171
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:11,600
And so like it like made my car sick even, even worse.

172
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:14,180
And I'm chronically online.

173
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:16,060
So I felt like I was in hell.

174
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:22,220
Like I was like, you know, like I got itch, like I was going through withdrawal and I was like, oh my god, just one last hit guys.

175
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,000
Oh, come on.

176
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,080
Just one last hit.

177
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:24,620

00:22:58,990 --> 00:23:02,200
No, I'm... I... I just, uh...

343
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:09,770
Okay, um...

344
00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:13,450
Shit, yeah, you're so... I mean, it's so hard to talk to you.

345
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:14,650
You are really pretty.

346
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:16,590
You are, though, not gonna lie.

347
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:17,050
Yeah, yeah.

348
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:22,590
Yeah, it's not how you talk to women.

349
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:27,640
It is?

350
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:30,240
You think the ladies love that I'm stumbling?

351
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:33,220
That I have negative riz right now?

352
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:39,360
Oh shit, sorry, I'll bring it back up a little bit more.

353
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:40,440
Oh shit.

354
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:42,180
Oh, she's gone.

355
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:43,480
Wait, my bedroom?

356
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,700
Oh my god, you definitely nailed it.

357
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:49,080
Oh my god, is that cute?

358
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,680
Guys, how is a negative riz?

359
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:58,700
How... guys, how does a negative riz if she came back to the bedroom with me?

360
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:03,840
Checkmate.

361
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,200
Check fucking mate.

362
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:10,920
Doki.

363
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:14,980
Hey Doki, is this stream safe to watch at work?

364
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:15,860
Asking for a friend...

365
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:16,780
Oh, it's very safe.

366
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:17,560
Don't worry, Cypher.

367
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:23,660
In fact, you should put it at, like, a high volume so all your co-workers could watch with you.

368
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,360
Thank you for the super chat, Cypher.

369
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:25,800
Thank you.

370
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:26,620
Thank you.

371
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:27,860
All right.

372
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,720
Oh, Yankee, thank you for the super chat.

373
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:31,080
Thank you.

374
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:31,460
Thank you.

375
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,540
It's my birthday today.

376
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:34,420
Thanks for playing Honey Pop on such a day.

377
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:35,820
Best gift ever.

378
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:37,080
Thank you for the super chat, Yankee.

379
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:37,500
Thank you.

380
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:38,040
Thank you.

381
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:40,600
Let's give a happy birthday before we go next, because I don't know...

382
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,320
I don't know what's gonna happen after this.

383
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:43,380
Like, I'm a little worried.

384
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,340
Happy birthday to you.

385
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:48,200
Happy birthday to you.

386
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:50,240
Happy birthday, dear Yankee.

387
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:51,760
Happy birthday to you.

388
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:52,680
All right.

389
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:53,840
Oh, I was having...

390
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:55,920
All right, I'm...

391
00:24:57,940 --> 00:24:59,020
Oh no, please.

392
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:01,480
Please, I... I don't know what I'm wearing.

393
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,240
I don't know if I'm wearing pajamas right now.

394
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:04,900
I'm afraid everything's a mess.

395
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:05,660
Yeah.

396
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,140
Wait, how did you get here?

397
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:08,540
Wait, exactly.

398
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,040
How did you get here?

399
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:15,880
My chat told me I'm negative Riz, but clearly, they're wrong.

400
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:19,120
See, guys?

401
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:21,120
They're so wrong.

402
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:24,500
I knew I had positive Riz.

403
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:28,960
How else was she in my... How else is she in my bedroom?

404
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:33,640
Hey, huh?

405
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:35,220
Did you... I mean, did...

406
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:36,880
Did we?

407
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,660
You and I?

408
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,080
Oh my god.

409
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,960
People said, like, you know...

410
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:47,160
Yeah, people said that, like, you know, I'm below her, but, like, look what happened.

411
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,600
You just gotta be funny.

412
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:52,380
If you're funny, you can get any girl or guy you want.

413
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:58,960
A love fairy?

414
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:03,720
Okay, but fairies... Fairies aren't real!

415
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,900
What do you mean?

416
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:11,520
Fairies are fake.

417
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:16,900
You see, as a love fairy, it's my job to help poor saps like you.

418
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,060
Poor saps?

419
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:20,220
It's just... What I do.

420
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:21,360
I don't like to rap.

421
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:24,200
Guys, no, no, she... Guys, she doesn't mean that.

422
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:29,760
All of my previous clients are basically walking bay magnets now.

423
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:31,420
You know that.

424
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:32,520
Wait.

425
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,980
Let's just say you will be my greatest accomplishment.

426
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:36,440
Wait.

427
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:39,120
Wait, as in, like...

428
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,040
Wait, wait a minute.

429
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:46,460
As in, like, you're gonna improve my Riz that's already really good.

430
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:47,920
That's what she means, guys.

431
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:53,180
She's saying that she's gonna work so hard that my Riz, which is, like, you know, above average...

432
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:55,700
Is now gonna be, like...

433
00:26:55,700 --> 00:27:01,540
Like, it's like when you go from, like, a B+, because you're an above average student, to an A.

434
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:03,280
That's, like, what she means, chat.

435
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,160
That's not...

436
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:10,440
She's... She's trying to say she's gonna make me, like, honor student, you know?

437
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:12,280
Um...

438
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:15,300
Um, yeah, it's... You're...

439
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:18,120
I'm having a hard time accepting the fair thing.

440
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,520
It's sort of, like, you know, it's not... I'm getting unimbursed right now.

441
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:22,460
And...

442
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,800
Wait, where do you wanna help me?

443
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:26,080
What's in... Yeah, where do you wanna help me?

444
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:27,000
What's in it for you?

445
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:29,120
Wait, I'm doing just fine on my own.

446
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:31,140
Yeah, wait, wait, no, thanks, but no thanks.

447
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:32,860
I'm... All I'm saying...

448
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:36,180
Is that I think I'm doing just fine on my own.

449
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,480
I don't need extra help.

450
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:43,700
Wait, what?

451
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:50,140
Oh, like, um, I... You know, like...

452
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:58,940
The f... You know, it's... It's... It's such a huge amount, that, like, numbers can't comprehend the amount, you know?

453
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:02,200
Oh my God, it's worse than I thought, isn't it?

454
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:03,380
Wait, why?

455
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:05,120
I literally...

456
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:08,720
It's so many that I can't even give a number.

457
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:10,980
You love it.

458
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:12,440
Or not, I don't care.

459
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:14,240
Sure, bro.

460
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:16,820
Like, I lost count.

461
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:19,900
I just... I just lost count, you know?

462
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:26,280
What do you mean read right... Wait, I'm going straight into Patron?

463
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:29,000
This is the date grid.

464
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:30,120
Date grid?

465
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,980
This is fucking visualed.

466
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:36,620
Learn affection by matching three or more of the circular tokens horizontally or vertically.

467
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:41,560
For a successful date, you have to fill the affection meter before you run out of moves.

468
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:43,340
Wow, I love visualed.

469
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:46,960
Match those orange ones with the crescent shape in the middle of the grid.

470
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:52,580
How the f... do I change this?

471
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:53,680
Where's the settings?

472
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,920
Okay, there we go.

473
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,760
Oh my gosh, she loves it.

474
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,660
No, Toki, it's the date grid.

475
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,080
Sexuality token?

476
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:23,860
Wait, what?

477
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:25,640
Which one's the sexuality?

478
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:27,880
Wait...

479
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:32,120
Wait, guys, I wasn't paying.

480
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,740
I thought it was just bejeweled.

481
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,140
What color was it?

482
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:39,640
I thought it was just bejeweled.

483
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:40,100
I didn't...

484
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:43,660
I didn't realize there was more to it.

485
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,100
Okay, let's see.

486
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:48,260
Oh, there.

487
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:49,220
There you go.

488
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:55,340
Extra steps?

489
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,340
Oh, passion.

490
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:00,940
So, like, red is lust and pink is passion.

491
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:09,440
Okay,

492
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,540
so we can't match the broken heart.

493
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:27,400
GoldenEye, what the f... is that supposed to mean, GoldenEye?

494
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:29,520
Wait, what do you mean by that?

495
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,460
I'm gonna pass every f... date.

496
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:34,380
Guys, I paused it, Riz.

497
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:36,660
All right.

498
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:37,700
Oh, I got a gift!

499
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:47,840
Sentiment was...

500
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:48,900
The teardrops, okay.

501
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:52,460
Okay, we need on the leftmost column.

502
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:53,580
Okay, we got this.

503
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,240
All right, easy.

504
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:56,360
Sentiment.

505
00:30:58,920 --> 00:30:59,460
Oh.

506
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,520
There you go.

507
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:12,040
Are we getting... Don't.

508
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:16,280
This is a question stream now.

509
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:19,480
So you can use them on your next...

510
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:23,440
Where are your eyes at, chat?

511
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:25,880
Where are your eyes at?

512
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:31,120
Okay.

513
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,420
Where were those eyes at?

514
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:38,800
Wait, don't think I didn't know.

515
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:42,140
Don't think I didn't know where those eyes were.

516
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:44,620
I could see where they're at.

517
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:51,180
All right, let's play bejeweled.

518
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,800
I'm not thinking right now.

519
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:53,980
I'm just... I'm moving.

520
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:56,400
Is it... It's working technically.

521
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:58,400
I'm not... There's no broken hearts.

522
00:31:58,820 --> 00:31:59,800
I'm bejeweling.

523
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:03,200
I mean, this is the easiest date of my life.

524
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:04,100
Oh my god.

525
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:08,620
Out of my, you know, millions of dates, you know, millions.

526
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:13,100
This is the worst.

527
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:15,280
Okay.

528
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:16,800
All right, let's see.

529
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:19,040
Let's just bejeweled this.

530
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:20,740
What else?

531
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:22,700
Okay, hearts here.

532
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:27,040
What do you mean I'm gonna fail?

533
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,160
Everything's gonna be okay.

534
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:30,480
That's how you play bejeweled.

535
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:31,160
You don't think.

536
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,320
You just do.

537
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:35,020
That's like... That's just how you riz.

538
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:36,020
You just... Oh, no.

539
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:38,240
Oh, no, they're all broken hearts.

540
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:38,540
Whoa.

541
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:39,800
How am I cooked?

542
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,060
There's so many.

543
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:43,000
Look, I got sentiment and then...

544
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,160
Um...

545
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:47,000
And then there's like heart.

546
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:52,140
And then, uh, there's the the lust and then passion.

547
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:54,280
Um...

548
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:56,160
More moons, affection.

549
00:32:57,340 --> 00:32:58,840
Okay, and then...

550
00:32:58,840 --> 00:32:59,460
Passion.

551
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:01,560
There you go.

552
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:03,100
See, we're almost there.

553
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:05,080
What do you mean long stream?

554
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:07,820
I'm avoiding all the broken hearts right now.

555
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:10,580
And then here... And I did it.

556
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:11,940
I did it.

557
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,680
I... You just gotta believe.

558
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,740
Flask guy, thank you for the super chat.

559
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:20,040
The very first super chat.

560
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:20,420
Thank you.

561
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:21,120
Thank you.

562
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:24,040
Um, how did this stream happen?

563
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,220
Best of luck on the...

564
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:28,560
I... I just... I didn't know.

565
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:29,540
I just...

566
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:31,180
I...

567
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:32,760
I didn't know.

568
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:36,180
Okay, we're gonna... Wait, I need to fix... Adjust the sound.

569
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:36,840
All right.

570
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:37,580
Goodbye, fair.

571
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:39,380
My game saved.

572
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:41,960
So, like, I'm gonna go back to the main menu.

573
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:45,000
You can tell this game was 10 years ago.

574
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:47,420
I have to manually go back.

575
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:49,900
I have to close the game and go back to the main menu.

576
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:54,600
Okay.

577
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:56,540
Here you go.

578
00:33:57,060 --> 00:33:59,480
I can't believe this game was 10 years ago.

579
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:00,440
All right.

580
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:01,200
Settings.

581
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,140
What do I have to do?

582
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:03,520
Sound effects low.

583
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:06,880
I'll do background music and sound effects low.

584
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:09,760
So then we can bring up the...

585
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:10,820
voice acting.

586
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:12,000
This should be good, right?

587
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:18,280
By the way, I didn't mark the stream R18, so this is gonna be the real test, guys.

588
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:23,060
If the stream was over and, like, and then YouTube marks this... All right.

589
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:30,660
You know, YouTube marking the stream R18 is, like, is, like, my ideal.

590
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:33,140
Like, the best case scenario.

591
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:33,360
Yeah.

592
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:41,060
The worst case scenario, like, is, like, I'm on their list.

593
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:46,520
As long as...

594
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:51,880
As long as I'm not on a list on... at YouTube.com, that's fine.

595
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:54,700
Like, at best, it's, like, they mark it R18.

596
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:56,980
The worst, I'm on a list, like...

597
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,920
Oh, the honeybee.

598
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:10,360
Oh, I got the honeybee!

599
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:19,400
Oh, god.

600
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:23,020
Isn't that... Am I a stalker?

601
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:31,960
Like, they said I'm a big boy.

602
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:35,160
Oh, my god.

603
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:36,500
I'm a big boy.

604
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,240
Oh, man.

605
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:43,780
Get that honeybee.

606
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:45,400
Oh.

607
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:50,620
To blow your nose, guys.

608
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:56,040
To blow your nose and other various bodily fluids, that means your tears, guys.

609
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,600
It means your tears.

610
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:00,180
The one other... There's no other fluids.

611
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:01,120
It's your tears.

612
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:03,800
Your tears and your nose.

613
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:05,900
Oh, okay.

614
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:06,160
Yeah.

615
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:08,340
I'm not gonna lie.

616
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:11,220
Back then, before... What's his name?

617
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:12,860
The guy for Hefner?

618
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:16,700
Before Hugh Hefner died, Playboy was actually...

619
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:18,820
Look, I never read Playboy.

620
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:21,540
I'm just saying, I knew from this from, like, the internet.

621
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:32,340
Not that I looked at Playboy, but I'm saying that, like, Playboy actually had a lot of really good articles unrelated to what it was known for.

622
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:46,960
If you guys didn't know that, they actually had, like, science articles, psychology articles, and, like, actual studies in Playboy, which is crazy to think about because there's, you know, their whole brand is, like, you know...

623
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:49,720
Ladies.

624
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:50,060
Ladies.

625
00:36:53,500 --> 00:37:04,900
It was, it was, like, actual, like, it was, like, a mag- it was, like, an educational magazine that just happened to have naked women in there.

626
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:07,080
So that's all, that's all I'm gonna say.

627
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:14,580
I know that, but I didn't know this was a fucking hentai game.

628
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:21,720
Okay, oh, or we could just play video games, you know?

629
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:25,960
I said, let's go talk to some broads.

630
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:28,100
Um, they are women.

631
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:32,560
At least call, at least, you know, be proper about it.

632
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:34,200
Respect the ladies.

633
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:36,580
You can't just call them broads.

634
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,780
Look, see, positive res there.

635
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,500
Or we just chill and play video games.

636
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:43,720
Or we just chill.

637
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:48,920
We can't chill!

638
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:50,180
All right.

639
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:52,220
Just do this.

640
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:56,000
Wait,

641
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,020
where did they go?

642
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:04,340
Express?

643
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:05,780
Thank you for the super chat.

644
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:06,880
Thank you, thank you.

645
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:11,340
Oh, where do they- oh, they have the university, the mall, the gym, the park.

646
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:14,220
I want a smart lady.

647
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:22,120
Not the shopping mall, that means she shops and like, I like money.

648
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:31,640
I want a smart- or, or we could go to Downwood Park.

649
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,600
So like, she could be like, down to earth.

650
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:37,560
And then like, she likes homemade gifts more.

651
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:39,920
So like, we could save money together.

652
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:40,620
Uh

653
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:50,240
Okay, all right, let's go to- no, but then she'd be like, she'd be somebody that likes to go outside.

654
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:54,160
And like, I don't want to go outside anymore.

655
00:38:57,060 --> 00:39:00,800
Let's not go- let's go to the cafe.

656
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:03,300
Let's do the cafe.

657
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:03,940
No.

658
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:07,580
All right, university or cafe, because I don't want to go outside.

659
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:08,920
I'll do the university.

660
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:10,780
She'd be smart, you know?

661
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,820
All right, nice.

662
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:18,460
I'm ready.

663
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:21,080
Also, does it sound better now, guys?

664
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:24,260
All right, my bedroom to university.

665
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:25,480
Let's go!

666
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:29,400
Oh shit, okay.

667
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:31,040
Oh, oh!

668
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:32,260
Whoa!

669
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:34,920
Oh, that's a teacher?

670
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,120
Oh my god, okay.

671
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:38,960
Um, there's me.

672
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:58,060
Oh my god, do I want a woman?

673
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:01,180
Or- or me.

674
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,700
Am I egotistical?

675
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:07,540
Or a woman?

676
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:20,780
Oh my god, Ms. Yumi.

677
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:23,120
Whoa.

678
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:31,900
Oh, you mean like- oh to be fair, two buttons are a button here.

679
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:34,800
But like, a teacher was wearing booty shirts, like...

680
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:42,520
Wait, I'm crazy?

681
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:44,980
Oh, okay.

682
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:45,680
Oh, thank god.

683
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:46,780
I was like, wait, what?

684
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:58,240
Oh, she's like, get the girl next door!

685
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:58,540
Get the girl next door!

686
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,200
Whoa, okay.

687
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:05,600
Um...

688
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:06,680
Hey.

689
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:10,920
It feels weird because I'm clearly not a student.

690
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:14,080
So it feels weird to lie to her and say I'm a student.

691
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:15,620
That's like a little weird.

692
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:19,360
So like, the other two choices aren't as great, but like...

693
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:21,300
Maybe she likes to be complimented.

694
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:22,680
I like to be complimented.

695
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:23,840
Chat, compliment me.

696
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:30,880
Wait, no, you are cute!

697
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:31,680
You're me!

698
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:38,940
Oh, no, I'm just trying to pick up girls.

699
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:39,680
Uh...

700
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:45,140
Um, okay, uh...

701
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:49,100
Uh...

702
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:54,680
No, but if all the girls here are as cute as you, I might have to reconsider.

703
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:59,780
You know, I was thinking about going to Harvard, but then, like, they don't have you there.

704
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:00,280
What?

705
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:01,880
You're crazy.

706
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:03,480
Oh, no.

707
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:05,160
Oh, she likes it!

708
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:12,680
Guys, she li- oh my- Guys, all I'm s- Guys, I told you I don't need help.

709
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:14,460
How is that negative riz?

710
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:15,740
She likes it!

711
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:17,960
She literally likes it!

712
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:20,280
How is that negative riz?

713
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:24,940
Um, if I end up going here, you'll just have to show me.

714
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:27,100
I'm literally in right now.

715
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:28,100
Um...

716
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:30,900
Okay,

717
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:35,640
all right, all right.

718
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:39,400
We're not- We're not gonna- We're not gonna be creepy, guys.

719
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:41,160
We're not- We're not gonna be creepy.

720
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:44,560
So we're gonna go be like- Sorry, am I holding you up from getting in the class?

721
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:45,720
You know, I'm being considerate.

722
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:47,300
I'm being considerate now.

723
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:49,260
No, don't worry about it.

724
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:50,780
I'm all done with classes for now.

725
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:52,600
My name is Tiffany, by the way.

726
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:54,300
She gave me her name.

727
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:59,240
She gave- She gave me a- She added me on her phone.

728
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:00,380
She gave me her number.

729
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:04,240
I didn't!

730
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:06,060
I didn't even need your help!

731
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:09,140
I went by sheer intuition.

732
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:14,220
We're so- The bar is so- Her standards are low, Doki.

733
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:21,100
Oh, Jesus.

734
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:26,120
Oh!

735
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,020
The girl finder screen?

736
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:36,120
Oh my god, my stocks are going up right now.

737
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:40,640
All right.

738
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:48,800
It's a time- Before I forget, the money you earn during our date, you can use that to buy gifts, food, and drinks using the store app on the Honeybee.

739
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:52,900
It'll even detect which gifts the girl you're talking to prefer and will mark them with an icon.

740
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:54,480
All right, let's see.

741
00:43:54,980 --> 00:43:56,660
All right, uh...

742
00:43:57,220 --> 00:43:57,240
Girls.

743
00:43:57,460 --> 00:43:58,580
Girl finder.

744
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:00,640
Shit, is it that time already?

745
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:01,660
No, wait!

746
00:44:01,820 --> 00:44:03,000
I- No, wait, what?

747
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:03,920
I'm gone!

748
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:04,320
Shit!

749
00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:07,560
I- I- I didn't realize it goes insta- All right, we'll- We'll do two.

750
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:08,960
We'll- We're ready.

751
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:09,700
We'll do two.

752
00:44:09,940 --> 00:44:15,800
We'll- No, I wanted to talk to- Oh, shit!

753
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:16,160
Okay.

754
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:17,960
Hello?

755
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:20,880
No!

756
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:23,180
I fumbled it!

757
00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:25,840
I fumbled it so fast!

758
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:31,640
Well, I think I have just the thing.

759
00:44:31,660 --> 00:44:35,260
I didn't realize it instant transmissions me to her.

760
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:38,200
Nothing like a little exercise to melt that stress away.

761
00:44:38,620 --> 00:44:39,980
Uh, not today.

762
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:41,100
I was in!

763
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:42,160
I was so in!

764
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:45,660
I was so in!

765
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:45,960
I'll be there.

766
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:48,300
I don't think I have anything else going on for once.

767
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:49,100
Great.

768
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:49,860
Can't wait.

769
00:44:50,540 --> 00:44:51,040
See you there.

770
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:54,860
Dude, bro.

771
00:44:55,180 --> 00:44:55,940
Yo, shit.

772
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:57,500
Thank you for the Akasupa.

773
00:44:57,700 --> 00:44:58,180
Thank you.

774
00:44:58,380 --> 00:44:59,840
Dude, pro-age.

775
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:02,360
I have like the worst case of yellow fever.

776
00:45:03,020 --> 00:45:03,040
Ever.

777
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:04,380
Ever.

778
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:07,000
Guys, this was written ten years ago.

779
00:45:08,380 --> 00:45:09,920
This is a tough approach.

780
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:15,180
She's kind of- Okay, I'm just- Doing something stupid to try and cheer her up.

781
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:17,040
It doesn't matter what.

782
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:18,580
The stupider, the better.

783
00:45:20,380 --> 00:45:20,920
Stupider?

784
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:22,020
Okay, guys.

785
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:23,000
All right.

786
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:25,200
Thank you for the Akasupa.

787
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:25,880
Thank you.

788
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:26,680
Thank you.

789
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:28,900
Doki knew it's at this moment.

790
00:45:29,140 --> 00:45:30,660
Doki knew she fucked up.

791
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:34,160
Oh my god.

792
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:36,600
Um...

793
00:45:37,620 --> 00:45:38,760
What are these?

794
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,440
What are these replies?

795
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:44,120
Why I- why I would never- what are these?

796
00:45:44,420 --> 00:45:46,580
Fuck these- Fuck these birds.

797
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:47,280
Am I right?

798
00:45:48,340 --> 00:45:49,740
She thinks I'm funny!

799
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:50,900
I like the birds.

800
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:53,540
Oh my god, she thinks I'm- she laughed.

801
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:56,200
Guys, if she laughs, you're in.

802
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:59,200
If she don't- But Doki, you're always laughing.

803
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:05,260
I'm only kidding.

804
00:46:05,420 --> 00:46:07,560
I just thought you were cute and wanted to meet you.

805
00:46:07,980 --> 00:46:10,980
Nah, I just like to bother people who look like they want to be left alone.

806
00:46:11,340 --> 00:46:14,360
But for- what are these fucking- What?

807
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:17,640
What are these options?

808
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:21,520
But for- okay, I'll be not a creep.

809
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:24,060
But for real, what's up?

810
00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:26,560
You look a little bummed out over there.

811
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:35,600
Oh, UOG?

812
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:38,700
It's the only university?

813
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:40,320
How small is the city?

814
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:41,380
A teacher?

815
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:43,160
You must be really smart.

816
00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:43,740
Oh, yeah.

817
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:44,580
What do you teach?

818
00:46:44,580 --> 00:46:47,140
Oh, so you got a sexy teacher angle.

819
00:46:47,420 --> 00:46:48,340
What if I go through?

820
00:46:48,980 --> 00:46:50,200
Guys, guys, whatever.

821
00:46:50,540 --> 00:46:51,540
It can't be that bad.

822
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:56,280
Like, guys, all I'm saying- It can't be that bad.

823
00:46:57,680 --> 00:46:59,120
Guys, I'm gonna do it.

824
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:03,980
I'm- It's- it's either- I bet it'll work, guys.

825
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:05,180
It's gonna work, guys.

826
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:06,040
Bro, it's gonna work.

827
00:47:06,260 --> 00:47:12,040
Like, she seems like the type of woman that would be like, oh, you're so silly, you know?

828
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:14,080
You'd be like, I'm gonna do- I'm going all in.

829
00:47:14,580 --> 00:47:15,620
I don't know about that.

830
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:18,340
I have a couple students who might agree with you, though.

831
00:47:20,300 --> 00:47:21,520
You hear that giggle?

832
00:47:25,540 --> 00:47:27,060
You hear that?

833
00:47:27,820 --> 00:47:30,060
Guys, I'm in.

834
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:31,600
Oh my god.

835
00:47:33,660 --> 00:47:35,040
We're so in.

836
00:47:35,300 --> 00:47:36,460
You heard that giggle?

837
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:38,280
Oh, okay.

838
00:47:38,380 --> 00:47:39,340
Let's check her profile.

839
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:42,560
Most desired sex- I fucking knew.

840
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:44,120
I was like, I- I knew it.

841
00:47:44,260 --> 00:47:48,400
It's like- It's like in How I Met Your Mother when it was like, was it the naked man?

842
00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:54,800
So like, it's like, you know, you go naked and either the woman rejects you or like fucking files a restraining order.

843
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:55,980
It's like this.

844
00:47:56,020 --> 00:47:57,180
It's like 50-50.

845
00:47:57,740 --> 00:48:02,860
So- So it's like in How I Met Your Mother and like, this is 10 years ago.

846
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:06,460
So it was basically like 10 years ago, Laura.

847
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:13,380
So basically, it's either she's gonna- she's gonna fucking say yes or like, it's over.

848
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:19,780
It works two out of three times, exactly.

849
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:26,100
All right, talent.

850
00:48:26,260 --> 00:48:30,080
Least desired- okay, as long as I'm not talented, that works.

851
00:48:30,630 --> 00:48:34,260
That's not- that's not- Oh, okay.

852
00:48:34,660 --> 00:48:35,740
Whoa, okay.

853
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:37,800
She- whoa, okay.

854
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:41,380
Um, she is- whoa, okay.

855
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:44,700
All right.

856
00:48:45,140 --> 00:48:48,180
Um, well she- oh, she likes it when you flirt with her.

857
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:48,500
Okay.

858
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:48,920
All right.

859
00:48:48,940 --> 00:48:50,220
That's- that's good.

860
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:50,780
All right.

861
00:48:50,900 --> 00:48:51,220
Okay.

862
00:48:51,340 --> 00:48:51,960
Whoa, okay.

863
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:54,160
This is gonna be- all right.

864
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:55,220
Let's- whoa, okay.

865
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:58,320
There's- I- I never got this far before.

866
00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:03,380
I can't- how do I give her an entire country?

867
00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:04,860
I- I don't know.

868
00:49:05,900 --> 00:49:11,680
It seems like I have to- I have to buy her a fucking entire country.

869
00:49:12,060 --> 00:49:13,460
So, oh my gosh.

870
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:18,420
Okay, I gotta figure out how- how to- how to fucking gift her a country too.

871
00:49:22,020 --> 00:49:24,840
Okay, uh, no, I never got this far.

872
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:26,640
I'm gonna talk with her.

873
00:49:26,740 --> 00:49:28,320
I'm gonna interact with her.

874
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:34,780
Okay, um, what would you say?

875
00:49:35,540 --> 00:49:36,960
I gotta know.

876
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:38,160
No, I shouldn't.

877
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:40,240
I already pushed it in the last question.

878
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:44,480
Um, what's your favorite place to hang?

879
00:49:45,340 --> 00:49:46,140
Oh!

880
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:51,960
Oh no, she's a gacha player.

881
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:54,900
Oh no.

882
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:02,860
You can't stop those people from their dailies.

883
00:50:02,860 --> 00:50:03,760
Oh no.

884
00:50:05,140 --> 00:50:06,600
Let's go gambling!

885
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:07,800
Okay.

886
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:18,300
Oh fu-

887
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:28,180
Oh shit, um.

888
00:50:28,980 --> 00:50:30,640
Oh, we're at that- okay.

889
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:37,100
I- you know, I didn't- I didn't think we were gonna- we're there yet, but oh, um.

890
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:48,020
Oh shit, okay.

891
00:50:52,780 --> 00:50:54,040
Here we go.

892
00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:54,740
Oh my god.

893
00:50:55,100 --> 00:50:56,440
Oh god.

894
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:58,380
I- I can't.

895
00:50:58,540 --> 00:50:59,520
I gotta talk to Tiffany.

896
00:51:02,940 --> 00:51:04,800
She's a little too forward, guys.

897
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:06,580
I- I'm not ready for that yet.

898
00:51:06,660 --> 00:51:14,340
It's- I- oh, I- you know, I- I- I- I didn't expect it to go at that level already.

899
00:51:14,620 --> 00:51:16,640
I thought we were still doing small talk.

900
00:51:17,180 --> 00:51:25,040
And um, I need- I need to be like- I need- I need to build up to that.

901
00:51:25,420 --> 00:51:28,120
And I'm like, I'm not there yet right now.

902
00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:30,120
Oh my god.

903
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:37,680
Bro, the first thing I asked was, what's your favorite place to hang out?

904
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:41,820
And then she went straight to like, hey, where did you not fuck?

905
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:48,020
The first time you meet some- that is not small talk.

906
00:51:48,140 --> 00:51:51,340
That is not- How do I- how do I do this?

907
00:51:51,420 --> 00:51:52,760
Okay, I'm gonna talk with her.

908
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:56,360
I'm gonna- I'm gonna- hey, so.

909
00:51:58,620 --> 00:52:00,800
Um, what are you studying in college?

910
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:05,800
Well, I haven't really decided on a major yet, so I'm just getting my core classes out of the way.

911
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,680
Wait, what did she say?

912
00:52:11,260 --> 00:52:12,340
I was hydrating.

913
00:52:12,940 --> 00:52:18,720
Guys, what- What is her hot- what does she- guys, I need- you guys are my notebook, guys.

914
00:52:18,820 --> 00:52:20,320
You guys are my notebook.

915
00:52:20,460 --> 00:52:21,320
What does she study?

916
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:22,920
Oh, she has no major.

917
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:23,380
Okay.

918
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:26,120
Okay, I'm worried that this is gonna be on the test later.

919
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:28,920
So like, I'm trying to make sure.

920
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:32,100
I'm trying to make sure this is not gonna be on the test.

921
00:52:35,380 --> 00:52:37,420
I'm not a bad listener.

922
00:52:37,700 --> 00:52:38,660
I was- wait, what?

923
00:52:38,780 --> 00:52:40,600
Oh, do you still- what the fuck?

924
00:52:41,020 --> 00:52:45,240
Do you still talk with any of your- Oh, no.

925
00:52:45,660 --> 00:52:47,420
What are these options?

926
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:51,140
God, no, those sluts can get bent.

927
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:53,720
Yeah, I keep in touch with some of them.

928
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:56,840
Well, that would require having a- had a girlfriend.

929
00:52:57,380 --> 00:52:57,780
What?

930
00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:00,700
What are these options?

931
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:04,020
Why can't I just be like, no?

932
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:10,120
Oh my god, she likes to flirt.

933
00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:11,780
Oh my god.

934
00:53:12,020 --> 00:53:14,140
I- none of these are like flirtatious.

935
00:53:15,100 --> 00:53:21,120
Like, they're- Um, oh no, um...

936
00:53:21,820 --> 00:53:22,360
Um...

937
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:27,560
What answers would you want me- Maybe if I'm pathetic, she likes that, right?

938
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:29,700
You think she'll like it if I'm pathetic?

939
00:53:31,420 --> 00:53:31,760
Oh.

940
00:53:35,660 --> 00:53:40,060
You don't- I just want it to be a little beta for you.

941
00:53:43,300 --> 00:53:43,840
Okay.

942
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:48,300
Um...

943
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:49,700
I don't know how ugly are we talking.

944
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:51,540
Probably not, I need to be attracted.

945
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:53,980
Of course, looks aren't everything, you know.

946
00:53:54,100 --> 00:53:56,340
That seems like she- she likes that.

947
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:58,600
Like, she doesn't like sexuality.

948
00:54:00,740 --> 00:54:01,400
You think so?

949
00:54:06,020 --> 00:54:08,060
I'm trying to be a good person.

950
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:11,160
What do you want from me, Tiffany?

951
00:54:14,180 --> 00:54:15,160
What's your profile?

952
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:18,660
You're- Oh, she likes Raven.

953
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:21,720
I'm trying to be a good person.

954
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:24,380
Like...

955
00:54:24,380 --> 00:54:26,480
Oh no, bro.

956
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:32,240
Why is- Why is her standards higher than the teacher?

957
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:35,620
I- Oh, she's a cheerleader.

958
00:54:35,740 --> 00:54:36,020
Okay.

959
00:54:36,220 --> 00:54:38,120
I am so hungry right now.

960
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:39,500
Oh, you're hungry?

961
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:40,820
Um...

962
00:54:40,820 --> 00:54:42,960
Do I have food for you?

963
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:45,300
Uh...

964
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:45,920
What?

965
00:54:46,820 --> 00:54:47,180
Food.

966
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:48,860
Okay, that's like...

967
00:54:48,860 --> 00:54:50,800
Girl, talk to- I need to be a bad boy.

968
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:54,040
All right, it's time to be a bad boy for Tiffany.

969
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:56,420
Um, do I have money?

970
00:54:56,580 --> 00:54:57,760
Okay, I have a thousand dollars.

971
00:54:59,260 --> 00:54:59,620
Um...

972
00:54:59,620 --> 00:55:01,840
Okay, she- she likes a bad boy.

973
00:55:01,980 --> 00:55:03,000
So I'm gonna give her...

974
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:06,360
I'm gonna get her a- I'm gonna get a chocolate.

975
00:55:07,300 --> 00:55:08,100
Wait, what's your favorite food?

976
00:55:08,140 --> 00:55:09,780
Wait, she says what her favorite food is, right?

977
00:55:10,860 --> 00:55:11,740
Favorite food.

978
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:13,000
Breakfast and candy.

979
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:13,380
Okay.

980
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:14,120
Yeah, I knew it.

981
00:55:14,180 --> 00:55:21,200
I knew- I knew you're a bad- You're- You're- Okay, Bubble, come on.

982
00:55:21,420 --> 00:55:27,260
Guys, I can't- Guys, I can't just give her good food right off the top of the bat.

983
00:55:27,340 --> 00:55:30,680
We gotta- Wait, how do I give this to her?

984
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:34,000
How do I- I want to give you this.

985
00:55:35,300 --> 00:55:36,320
How do I give this?

986
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:39,080
Please...

987
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:39,960
Stop.

988
00:55:40,580 --> 00:55:42,860
I- I want to give this to you.

989
00:55:43,580 --> 00:55:44,720
Down there?

990
00:55:44,860 --> 00:55:45,240
Where?

991
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:47,440
That's the trash can.

992
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:48,940
I'm not gonna throw it away.

993
00:55:54,780 --> 00:55:55,900
Bottom bar?

994
00:55:56,260 --> 00:55:57,360
There's no bottom bar.

995
00:55:57,460 --> 00:55:58,560
What are you talking about?

996
00:55:59,380 --> 00:56:01,020
The lower inventory?

997
00:56:01,300 --> 00:56:01,880
This?

998
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:05,500
Oh, exit phone.

999
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:08,780
No, I can't exit the phone?

1000
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:11,900
Behind that window?

1001
00:56:12,100 --> 00:56:12,580
Where?

1002
00:56:12,940 --> 00:56:14,460
Wait, don't- don't- don't fuck with me.

1003
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:20,300
I can't- I can't- I can't- I can't click out of the way!

1004
00:56:22,980 --> 00:56:23,460
Okay.

1005
00:56:24,540 --> 00:56:25,020
Oh.

1006
00:56:25,320 --> 00:56:26,840
Oh my god, there you go.

1007
00:56:27,260 --> 00:56:28,260
Okay, we got this.

1008
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:30,340
All I can think about is food.

1009
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:32,360
You still- oh my god, okay.

1010
00:56:33,140 --> 00:56:34,580
Oh shit, okay.

1011
00:56:34,780 --> 00:56:39,540
Oh my god, she's- She's a gold digger.

1012
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:47,020
Wait.

1013
00:56:55,580 --> 00:56:58,380
It's literally just gum.

1014
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:01,280
No, but she wants so much more.

1015
00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:04,380
She wants so much more.

1016
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:06,660
She wants food.

1017
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:07,700
She's hungry.

1018
00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:09,840
She's like, oh, I'm so hungry.

1019
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:15,060
All right, it's just- It's four hundred dollars worth of- okay.

1020
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:23,620
All right, if she doesn't give me a date after I bought her four hundred dollars worth of pancakes, I'm- Like, even the teacher doesn't ask me for stuff?

1021
00:57:24,460 --> 00:57:24,880
Question time.

1022
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:25,840
Oh shit.

1023
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:29,120
Extraterrestrial stuff, you know, like aliens and that.

1024
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:32,680
Oh my god, I don't know what she wants from me.

1025
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:34,720
Like, the teacher was so easy.

1026
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:36,200
I just gotta be stupid.

1027
00:57:36,740 --> 00:57:42,520
Then she'd be like, I can fix- She'd be like, oh my god, I'm gonna take care of this boy.

1028
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:45,460
But like, I don't know what she wants from me.

1029
00:57:46,540 --> 00:57:48,080
I'll believe it when I see it.

1030
00:57:48,180 --> 00:57:49,240
They're real, believe me.

1031
00:57:49,340 --> 00:57:51,260
I was visited once when I was a kid.

1032
00:57:51,560 --> 00:57:52,600
You'll never know what's up there.

1033
00:57:52,980 --> 00:57:54,700
She doesn't like it when I'm smart.

1034
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:57,300
She doesn't like it when I'm a good person.

1035
00:57:57,560 --> 00:58:04,900
So like, as a bad boy, I should be like, I believe it when I see it.

1036
00:58:05,140 --> 00:58:06,060
Okay, good.

1037
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:07,160
Oh, thank god.

1038
00:58:07,300 --> 00:58:09,020
My friend Nikki is like obsessed with- Thank god.

1039
00:58:09,300 --> 00:58:10,120
She's nuts.

1040
00:58:12,860 --> 00:58:13,580
Thank god.

1041
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:14,780
Okay, she hates nerds.

1042
00:58:14,820 --> 00:58:16,020
Okay, that's good to know.

1043
00:58:19,640 --> 00:58:20,680
That's good to know.

1044
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:22,000
She doesn't like nerds.

1045
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:22,260
Okay.

1046
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:23,320
What do you want to know about me?

1047
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:24,740
All right, I want to know...

1048
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:28,220
Um, what's your favorite place to hang out?

1049
00:58:28,220 --> 00:58:31,980
I know it's boring, but I kind of just like to hang out around campus.

1050
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:34,600
Oh shit, I learned.

1051
00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:36,700
All right, we're on a date.

1052
00:58:37,060 --> 00:58:39,660
I gave you $400 worth of pancakes.

1053
00:58:39,780 --> 00:58:41,080
I guess I've got some time.

1054
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:41,640
Yes!

1055
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:42,600
Let's do it.

1056
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:43,500
I'm in.

1057
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:45,120
Oh my god, I knew it.

1058
00:58:45,420 --> 00:58:46,720
I knew I'm not a loser.

1059
00:58:48,080 --> 00:58:48,860
Knew it.

1060
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:51,400
I knew I'm not a fucking loser.

1061
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:54,080
My friend Nikki would love this.

1062
00:58:54,520 --> 00:58:55,760
She's really into games.

1063
00:58:58,940 --> 00:59:00,060
Oh shit.

1064
00:59:00,680 --> 00:59:01,820
Oh fuck.

1065
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:02,780
Okay, um...

1066
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:06,700
Anyway, bejeweled time.

1067
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:07,620
Let's go.

1068
00:59:08,100 --> 00:59:09,360
Let's fucking go.

1069
00:59:09,540 --> 00:59:11,380
No think, just bejeweled.

1070
00:59:11,860 --> 00:59:16,700
Surely nothing could go wrong if I don't enter- don't figure out every single move I do.

1071
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:18,640
Like...

1072
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:19,780
Look at that.

1073
00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:21,300
Okay, um...

1074
00:59:21,300 --> 00:59:22,360
And then we put it here.

1075
00:59:22,780 --> 00:59:23,660
Plus one set.

1076
00:59:23,700 --> 00:59:24,180
120.

1077
00:59:24,180 --> 00:59:24,600
120.

1078
00:59:25,380 --> 00:59:27,520
Okay, she likes green.

1079
00:59:27,620 --> 00:59:28,040
Okay.

1080
00:59:28,540 --> 00:59:28,960
All right.

1081
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,200
That's a good- that's- thank you for telling me that.

1082
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:33,400
That's actually- that's really good to know.

1083
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:35,360
Okay, we'll put this here.

1084
00:59:36,740 --> 00:59:37,260
Uh...

1085
00:59:37,260 --> 00:59:39,020
And then get the red over here.

1086
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:40,280
And...

1087
00:59:40,820 --> 00:59:41,540
Don't spam.

1088
00:59:41,660 --> 00:59:42,380
It's too late.

1089
00:59:42,980 --> 00:59:45,540
It's- It's too late.

1090
00:59:49,140 --> 00:59:56,660
Don't keep- Don't keep what someone asks for a piece of juicy- This gold taking bitch.

1091
00:59:57,540 --> 00:59:59,560
Thank you for the super chat.

1092
00:59:59,700 --> 01:00:00,040
Thank you.

1093
01:00:00,100 --> 01:00:02,900
I had to buy that gum.

1094
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:07,920
It don't- wait I have moves!

1095
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:08,760
Oh shit!

1096
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:11,120
Okay, JK I have nine moves left.

1097
01:00:11,220 --> 01:00:12,880
Oh I forgot about the moves.

1098
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:15,140
I- Oh my god, I forgot.

1099
01:00:15,540 --> 01:00:18,340
I forgot about the boobs.

1100
01:00:18,760 --> 01:00:19,760
Oh shit.

1101
01:00:20,300 --> 01:00:24,400
I just realized that was a thing.

1102
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:25,860
Oh, that's my bad.

1103
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:28,040
That's actually my bad.

1104
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:30,620
I finally... this is bejeweled.

1105
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:33,420
This is bejeweled.

1106
01:00:33,860 --> 01:00:36,080
Oh no, my date!

1107
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:38,280
My date!

1108
01:00:40,560 --> 01:00:42,780
Okay, oh my god.

1109
01:00:42,900 --> 01:00:43,960
Oh shit.

1110
01:00:44,080 --> 01:00:44,500
Okay.

1111
01:00:44,840 --> 01:00:45,520
Oh fuck.

1112
01:00:45,700 --> 01:00:46,600
Oh fuck.

1113
01:00:46,740 --> 01:00:47,240
Oh shit.

1114
01:00:50,100 --> 01:00:52,220
So, it's not over!

1115
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:53,780
This is salvageable.

1116
01:00:54,980 --> 01:00:56,680
This is fixed.

1117
01:00:56,760 --> 01:00:57,900
I can fix this.

1118
01:00:58,460 --> 01:01:00,400
I can fix this.

1119
01:01:00,900 --> 01:01:02,620
It's not that bad.

1120
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:06,820
It's not that bad, guys.

1121
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:11,220
Is it a bad time to mention I've never played bejeweled?

1122
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:12,700
Is this a bad time?

1123
01:01:13,560 --> 01:01:15,560
Is it noticeable, chat?

1124
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:20,660
Is it noticeable that I've never played bejeweled, guys?

1125
01:01:24,460 --> 01:01:29,880
I didn't know that, you know, there's like limited moves.

1126
01:01:30,040 --> 01:01:31,920
I didn't realize that was a thing.

1127
01:01:33,700 --> 01:01:35,600
Oh fuck, okay.

1128
01:01:35,840 --> 01:01:38,320
Alright, let's figure this out.

1129
01:01:38,420 --> 01:01:39,420
Okay, that's good.

1130
01:01:39,580 --> 01:01:40,420
We needed that.

1131
01:01:41,060 --> 01:01:41,620
And then...

1132
01:01:44,470 --> 01:01:46,520
Yeah, from the start.

1133
01:01:46,740 --> 01:01:48,640
It can't be that bad.

1134
01:01:49,020 --> 01:01:50,400
It's fixable.

1135
01:01:50,920 --> 01:01:53,320
It's actually fixable.

1136
01:01:53,840 --> 01:01:54,260
Okay.

1137
01:01:56,660 --> 01:01:57,340
Alright.

1138
01:01:57,680 --> 01:01:59,460
Oh shit, okay.

1139
01:02:00,100 --> 01:02:01,540
We're so close.

1140
01:02:01,860 --> 01:02:03,960
It's salvageable, guys.

1141
01:02:04,860 --> 01:02:06,060
Oh my god, two moves.

1142
01:02:06,220 --> 01:02:09,800
This is the biggest two moves of my life.

1143
01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:11,840
That's three.

1144
01:02:13,380 --> 01:02:14,620
I did it.

1145
01:02:15,300 --> 01:02:17,220
I am winnable.

1146
01:02:21,900 --> 01:02:27,040
I saved... I'm the coolest guy she's ever known.

1147
01:02:27,360 --> 01:02:29,320
Chat, I told you.

1148
01:02:29,700 --> 01:02:31,360
I'm so fucking cool.

1149
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:34,180
I barely got it.

1150
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:35,160
Let's go.

1151
01:02:35,700 --> 01:02:39,000
I'm so fucking cool, guys.

1152
01:02:39,660 --> 01:02:40,220
Alright.

1153
01:02:41,660 --> 01:02:46,140
Every date you go on is gonna be more challenging than the last.

1154
01:02:46,560 --> 01:02:50,380
If you don't improve your traits, you're gonna blow it.

1155
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:50,920
Trust me.

1156
01:02:51,020 --> 01:02:56,180
You can use the honey you earn from interacting girls to upgrade your traits using the trait app.

1157
01:02:56,640 --> 01:02:58,020
Pay attention to the appetite meter.

1158
01:02:58,200 --> 01:03:00,280
A girl gets hungry standing around chatting all day.

1159
01:03:00,360 --> 01:03:04,220
If she's hungry, check the store to see if there are any food items that she might like.

1160
01:03:04,220 --> 01:03:08,160
Okay, if I talk to her too much, she's gonna get too hungry.

1161
01:03:08,540 --> 01:03:08,980
Okay.

1162
01:03:11,220 --> 01:03:13,960
Guys, is the volume a lot better now?

1163
01:03:14,320 --> 01:03:14,620
Chat?

1164
01:03:15,560 --> 01:03:16,880
Fails chatting, fails date.

1165
01:03:17,020 --> 01:03:20,200
This would be a lot... I didn't fail the date.

1166
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:22,200
You guys hear her now, guys?

1167
01:03:23,060 --> 01:03:25,060
Also, Enon, thank you for the super chat.

1168
01:03:25,140 --> 01:03:25,880
Thank you, thank you.

1169
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:26,560
Okay, that's good.

1170
01:03:26,940 --> 01:03:28,180
That's good that you can hear her now.

1171
01:03:29,180 --> 01:03:30,280
That's good.

1172
01:03:31,860 --> 01:03:32,660
Alright.

1173
01:03:32,980 --> 01:03:34,920
Oh, she wants me, guys.

1174
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:37,700
Guys, I'm so in.

1175
01:03:38,340 --> 01:03:40,680
I'm so in, guys.

1176
01:03:45,880 --> 01:03:48,880
I'm gonna talk to this girl now.

1177
01:03:51,100 --> 01:03:54,040
I spent $500 on her.

1178
01:03:54,440 --> 01:03:56,500
I'm gonna talk to this other lady.

1179
01:03:58,640 --> 01:04:00,840
Oh, she's at... Oh, it's me!

1180
01:04:08,520 --> 01:04:12,040
Do you prefer one... What do you do, like, for... Oh, wait, no.

1181
01:04:12,100 --> 01:04:12,960
We know she's a teacher.

1182
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:17,000
Do you prefer one season over the others, ma'am?

1183
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:20,000
If I had to pick, I'd probably say autumn.

1184
01:04:20,560 --> 01:04:22,220
I'm a sucker for all the colors.

1185
01:04:23,260 --> 01:04:23,480
Autumn!

1186
01:04:23,980 --> 01:04:25,600
I learned about her favorite season!

1187
01:04:26,040 --> 01:04:26,800
I'm in.

1188
01:04:26,940 --> 01:04:28,020
I'm so in.

1189
01:04:28,100 --> 01:04:28,920
Alright, we got upgrade.

1190
01:04:30,280 --> 01:04:32,640
The fuck am I gonna do with a flute?

1191
01:04:38,680 --> 01:04:43,820
What the fuck are these... Okay, can I... Oh, I can't upgrade anything.

1192
01:04:43,960 --> 01:04:44,900
Okay, that's fine.

1193
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:46,820
That's fine.

1194
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:48,980
I don't need to upgrade anything.

1195
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:55,580
Okay, she likes me when I'm pathetic.

1196
01:04:56,020 --> 01:04:56,300
Okay.

1197
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:11,620
No, she...

1198
01:05:18,380 --> 01:05:20,380
I'm, like, in her mind right now, guys.

1199
01:05:20,420 --> 01:05:23,760
The reason why I'm doing really well with her is that...

1200
01:05:24,360 --> 01:05:27,760
Guys, I'm not, like, on her wavelength or anything.

1201
01:05:28,200 --> 01:05:30,180
I just, like...

1202
01:05:31,900 --> 01:05:33,380
I'm just in her mind.

1203
01:05:33,480 --> 01:05:35,840
I'm just... I'm literally mind-reading her.

1204
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:46,960
Alright.

1205
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:48,380
What did you study in college?

1206
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:53,720
Same.

1207
01:05:54,420 --> 01:05:56,000
I regret it.

1208
01:05:56,420 --> 01:05:56,860
Alright.

1209
01:06:00,500 --> 01:06:01,740
Oh, shit.

1210
01:06:01,900 --> 01:06:02,660
Okay, I'm sorry.

1211
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:03,420
Oh, whoa.

1212
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:04,880
Yes, ma'am.

1213
01:06:06,920 --> 01:06:08,620
Okay, fruit and veg.

1214
01:06:08,700 --> 01:06:09,640
Okay, yes.

1215
01:06:10,080 --> 01:06:11,100
Yes, ma'am.

1216
01:06:11,740 --> 01:06:14,400
I'll buy you the food, ma'am.

1217
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:20,140
Okay, ask on a date.

1218
01:06:21,720 --> 01:06:22,360
Alright.

1219
01:06:27,160 --> 01:06:27,940
Alright.

1220
01:06:29,140 --> 01:06:29,920
Hi.

1221
01:06:30,740 --> 01:06:32,980
First date with the professor.

1222
01:06:33,800 --> 01:06:34,680
We have no gifts.

1223
01:06:35,840 --> 01:06:36,760
I have a gift.

1224
01:06:39,240 --> 01:06:41,820
Oh my God, she brought me to a nice place.

1225
01:06:42,040 --> 01:06:43,220
What does she like, guys?

1226
01:06:43,780 --> 01:06:44,940
What was her favorite color?

1227
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:49,160
Guys, what's her favorite color?

1228
01:06:49,220 --> 01:06:49,680
Is it red?

1229
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:50,720
It has to be red.

1230
01:06:51,960 --> 01:06:52,860
It was red.

1231
01:06:52,940 --> 01:06:53,760
Okay, alright.

1232
01:06:54,700 --> 01:06:56,020
Gotta min-max this.

1233
01:06:56,920 --> 01:06:58,840
Okay, if I do this...

1234
01:06:59,660 --> 01:07:02,340
Alright, and then, I do the red here.

1235
01:07:03,140 --> 01:07:04,620
We min-maxing, guys.

1236
01:07:05,840 --> 01:07:07,180
Gotta make sure we have... You know what?

1237
01:07:07,180 --> 01:07:08,280
I'm gonna...

1238
01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:11,020
I'm gonna convert everything to passion now.

1239
01:07:11,620 --> 01:07:12,700
I'm gonna optimize.

1240
01:07:13,100 --> 01:07:14,180
Oh, I need six sentiments.

1241
01:07:14,440 --> 01:07:15,000
Oh, shit.

1242
01:07:15,080 --> 01:07:15,340
Okay.

1243
01:07:15,720 --> 01:07:17,000
We need sentiment, guys.

1244
01:07:17,900 --> 01:07:19,300
We're making sure... Oh!

1245
01:07:19,460 --> 01:07:20,460
We're doing it!

1246
01:07:21,100 --> 01:07:21,720
Oh, shit.

1247
01:07:21,860 --> 01:07:22,440
Oh, okay.

1248
01:07:24,320 --> 01:07:24,840
Okay.

1249
01:07:25,240 --> 01:07:26,920
Okay, this is... Okay.

1250
01:07:29,960 --> 01:07:32,080
Okay, maybe here?

1251
01:07:32,080 --> 01:07:34,040
Alright, we got the passion.

1252
01:07:34,420 --> 01:07:35,460
We need more sentiment.

1253
01:07:35,660 --> 01:07:36,540
We need like...

1254
01:07:36,540 --> 01:07:41,360
A couple... We got the sentiment, so let's convert all the broken hearts now.

1255
01:07:41,620 --> 01:07:43,660
And then, pink first for combo.

1256
01:07:44,420 --> 01:07:45,080
Wait, what?

1257
01:07:45,540 --> 01:07:45,860
Really?

1258
01:07:48,280 --> 01:07:48,860
Okay.

1259
01:07:49,820 --> 01:07:51,280
I'm getting all the pinks.

1260
01:07:52,020 --> 01:07:53,500
I'm getting it all in.

1261
01:07:55,660 --> 01:07:56,240
Then...

1262
01:07:56,240 --> 01:07:57,800
We need the passion, though.

1263
01:07:57,860 --> 01:07:59,720
The passion is where...

1264
01:07:59,720 --> 01:08:01,440
Pink has a multiplier?

1265
01:08:02,140 --> 01:08:03,600
I'm at 26.

1266
01:08:03,720 --> 01:08:04,980
I have nine moves left.

1267
01:08:05,020 --> 01:08:07,340
Guys, I'm gonna fuck up my day.

1268
01:08:10,140 --> 01:08:10,760
Guys!

1269
01:08:12,680 --> 01:08:13,320
Guys!

1270
01:08:16,480 --> 01:08:17,680
Guys, I'm...

1271
01:08:18,360 --> 01:08:21,080
Guys, this isn't looking so hot.

1272
01:08:21,900 --> 01:08:25,420
This is not looking so good, guys.

1273
01:08:27,220 --> 01:08:28,980
Okay, we got an extra...

1274
01:08:32,080 --> 01:08:32,720
Oh.

1275
01:08:34,990 --> 01:08:36,340
This is... Oh.

1276
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:38,450
This is...

1277
01:08:39,260 --> 01:08:39,880
Okay.

1278
01:08:43,330 --> 01:08:45,060
This is salvageable.

1279
01:08:46,210 --> 01:08:47,770
We can fix this.

1280
01:08:48,750 --> 01:08:49,710
We...

1281
01:08:50,440 --> 01:08:51,890
We can fix this.

1282
01:08:51,970 --> 01:08:53,200
We got an extra move.

1283
01:08:54,470 --> 01:08:54,980
And...

1284
01:08:55,490 --> 01:08:57,280
We can fix this.

1285
01:08:59,670 --> 01:09:01,850
Go for four in a row?

1286
01:09:01,850 --> 01:09:03,890
I had four?

1287
01:09:14,340 --> 01:09:15,360
Here?

1288
01:09:23,760 --> 01:09:25,160
Okay.

1289
01:09:25,640 --> 01:09:28,760
We have seven left.

1290
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:33,160
This is...

1291
01:09:33,160 --> 01:09:37,880
This is not looking so good.

1292
01:09:38,780 --> 01:09:44,860
This is not looking so good, guys.

1293
01:10:00,930 --> 01:10:01,650
This is...

1294
01:10:01,650 --> 01:10:01,650
Wait.

1295
01:10:01,910 --> 01:10:03,210
No, this is...

1296
01:10:03,210 --> 01:10:04,110
Salvageable.

1297
01:10:04,790 --> 01:10:05,990
This is...

1298
01:10:07,690 --> 01:10:09,270
We're so cucked.

1299
01:10:09,330 --> 01:10:10,390
We're so fucked.

1300
01:10:10,670 --> 01:10:11,670
This is salvageable.

1301
01:10:11,670 --> 01:10:12,650
I can fix this.

1302
01:10:13,170 --> 01:10:14,690
We can fix this.

1303
01:10:16,110 --> 01:10:17,550
This is fixable.

1304
01:10:19,650 --> 01:10:20,830
Oh, fuck.

1305
01:10:20,930 --> 01:10:21,210
Okay.

1306
01:10:24,030 --> 01:10:25,130
We can...

1307
01:10:25,130 --> 01:10:26,910
We can...

1308
01:10:26,910 --> 01:10:27,330
We can fix this.

1309
01:10:28,070 --> 01:10:28,990
We can...

1310
01:10:30,410 --> 01:10:31,090
We can...

1311
01:10:32,490 --> 01:10:34,170
We can...

1312
01:10:34,170 --> 01:10:36,550
Guys, we can fix this.

1313
01:10:37,490 --> 01:10:40,190
How am I failing this day?

1314
01:10:41,290 --> 01:10:42,370
Oh my god.

1315
01:10:42,510 --> 01:10:42,870
Why?

1316
01:10:43,110 --> 01:10:45,390
Why don't I have unlimited moves?

1317
01:10:46,190 --> 01:10:46,670
Why?

1318
01:10:47,650 --> 01:10:50,410
Why don't I have unlimited moves?

1319
01:10:50,410 --> 01:10:53,170
Ma'am, I thought you liked me.

1320
01:10:58,600 --> 01:11:01,900
Ma'am, I thought you liked me.

1321
01:11:03,420 --> 01:11:05,320
Don't you like me?

1322
01:11:07,740 --> 01:11:09,140
Wait, I got another move.

1323
01:11:09,620 --> 01:11:10,800
Guys, I'm back.

1324
01:11:10,900 --> 01:11:12,340
I got another move.

1325
01:11:12,720 --> 01:11:14,680
I'm back, guys.

1326
01:11:14,840 --> 01:11:16,500
It's not over yet.

1327
01:11:16,620 --> 01:11:18,340
I got one more in me.

1328
01:11:18,720 --> 01:11:21,920
I got one more in me, guys.

1329
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:24,200
It's not over yet.

1330
01:11:24,700 --> 01:11:27,380
I still have one more in me.

1331
01:11:28,140 --> 01:11:30,060
Oh, I have one more move.

1332
01:11:30,300 --> 01:11:30,900
Guys, it's over.

1333
01:11:35,420 --> 01:11:36,960
Now it's over.

1334
01:11:41,460 --> 01:11:44,160
I need a damn miracle.

1335
01:11:44,860 --> 01:11:46,080
This will be the miracle.

1336
01:11:48,480 --> 01:11:49,040
No!

1337
01:11:51,320 --> 01:11:53,320
I forgot to see the red!

1338
01:11:55,020 --> 01:11:57,120
Don't beat yourself up.

1339
01:11:57,620 --> 01:11:59,820
This is a bad date.

1340
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:02,140
I don't understand.

1341
01:12:05,500 --> 01:12:06,480
I got a new move.

1342
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,620
Every time you give a girl a kiss, she'll love it.

1343
01:12:09,680 --> 01:12:12,060
I want to send you something to use on dates.

1344
01:12:12,160 --> 01:12:13,140
I'm such a nice...

1345
01:12:13,140 --> 01:12:14,400
You do it now?

1346
01:12:16,060 --> 01:12:17,060
Oh my god.

1347
01:12:17,660 --> 01:12:19,700
Now you give me the gift?

1348
01:12:21,500 --> 01:12:23,420
Is it only on dates?

1349
01:12:23,900 --> 01:12:25,320
Where like...

1350
01:12:25,320 --> 01:12:26,580
She'll love me more?

1351
01:12:31,630 --> 01:12:33,050
Thank you for the super chat.

1352
01:12:33,130 --> 01:12:34,150
Thank you, thank you.

1353
01:12:35,210 --> 01:12:37,310
If the streamer reflects the chat, then we're really cooked.

1354
01:12:37,430 --> 01:12:38,390
No, guys, guys.

1355
01:12:38,790 --> 01:12:40,450
No, it's not that bad.

1356
01:12:41,090 --> 01:12:43,170
Guys, it's not that bad.

1357
01:12:43,670 --> 01:12:44,230
Like...

1358
01:12:44,770 --> 01:12:47,610
We're on the same wavelength, guys.

1359
01:12:48,330 --> 01:12:49,870
We're literally like...

1360
01:12:50,830 --> 01:12:51,850
On the same wavelength.

1361
01:12:52,750 --> 01:12:53,890
So like, I need some...

1362
01:12:53,890 --> 01:12:54,230
Okay.

1363
01:12:55,130 --> 01:12:56,090
Use an additional hundred.

1364
01:12:56,810 --> 01:12:57,150
Okay.

1365
01:12:57,730 --> 01:12:59,910
Talent token matches given...

1366
01:12:59,910 --> 01:13:02,010
Guys, which one is the...

1367
01:13:02,730 --> 01:13:06,870
Sexuality token matches given additional plus a hundred of...

1368
01:13:07,670 --> 01:13:09,450
Alright, we need something.

1369
01:13:10,590 --> 01:13:13,890
Product token multiplied to the affection earned from a match by one.

1370
01:13:14,230 --> 01:13:15,750
Guys, which one is the best?

1371
01:13:16,250 --> 01:13:16,670
Guys.

1372
01:13:16,670 --> 01:13:17,730
We need a...

1373
01:13:18,810 --> 01:13:20,410
Passion first.

1374
01:13:20,810 --> 01:13:21,370
Which one?

1375
01:13:21,770 --> 01:13:23,270
We need a...

1376
01:13:23,270 --> 01:13:24,190
Is it sexuality?

1377
01:13:24,530 --> 01:13:26,310
Oh, this is passion, right?

1378
01:13:30,360 --> 01:13:31,320
Okay, passion.

1379
01:13:31,860 --> 01:13:32,140
Alright.

1380
01:13:33,060 --> 01:13:33,860
Increases...

1381
01:13:33,860 --> 01:13:35,080
Level increases six and...

1382
01:13:35,080 --> 01:13:35,260
Okay.

1383
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:36,740
We got the passion.

1384
01:13:37,240 --> 01:13:37,660
Alright.

1385
01:13:38,720 --> 01:13:40,100
We'll come back.

1386
01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:41,340
Don't worry.

1387
01:13:42,720 --> 01:13:43,120
Okay.

1388
01:13:45,340 --> 01:13:47,520
I gotta know what...

1389
01:13:50,080 --> 01:13:51,160
Okay.

1390
01:13:55,860 --> 01:14:01,000
Bro, just like...

1391
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:01,620
Just like...

1392
01:14:06,260 --> 01:14:06,800
Okay.

1393
01:14:14,220 --> 01:14:15,720
I don't know what to do.

1394
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:17,880
I'm...

1395
01:14:18,120 --> 01:14:20,340
I don't know what to do.

1396
01:14:24,330 --> 01:14:24,970
Okay.

1397
01:14:26,050 --> 01:14:27,790
Give her an item and start.

1398
01:14:28,070 --> 01:14:28,890
What do I do?

1399
01:14:30,470 --> 01:14:30,810
Wait.

1400
01:14:31,590 --> 01:14:32,410
What do I...

1401
01:14:33,190 --> 01:14:34,590
On to the next girl?

1402
01:14:35,190 --> 01:14:36,550
Go to a new girl?

1403
01:14:37,450 --> 01:14:38,090
Okay.

1404
01:14:38,490 --> 01:14:38,990
Like...

1405
01:14:38,990 --> 01:14:39,530
Okay.

1406
01:14:40,490 --> 01:14:41,130
But...

1407
01:14:41,130 --> 01:14:42,230
They're both perfect.

1408
01:14:42,630 --> 01:14:44,990
Why do I need new girls when I have these two?

1409
01:14:45,370 --> 01:14:49,030
When I have these two ladies, why would I need a new girl?

1410
01:14:50,430 --> 01:14:51,090
Alright.

1411
01:14:51,450 --> 01:14:52,150
Turtle Beach.

1412
01:14:52,930 --> 01:14:54,530
Crash and burn.

1413
01:14:59,450 --> 01:15:02,990
You said I failed your date and now you want me to be back?

1414
01:15:06,070 --> 01:15:08,390
This is fucking hot and cold shit.

1415
01:15:12,450 --> 01:15:13,110
Yeah.

1416
01:15:16,530 --> 01:15:17,850
Try water.

1417
01:15:22,090 --> 01:15:22,890
Her?

1418
01:15:25,310 --> 01:15:28,690
Bro, I can barely see an ankle right now.

1419
01:15:34,110 --> 01:15:36,090
Am I nobody?

1420
01:15:52,760 --> 01:15:56,240
You can't keep all that boob to yourself, hun.

1421
01:15:56,720 --> 01:15:58,440
It's not fair to the rest of the world.

1422
01:15:58,680 --> 01:16:01,440
The world would be just fine without my...

1423
01:16:02,040 --> 01:16:02,320
boobs.

1424
01:16:02,740 --> 01:16:04,760
Yeah, but I won't.

1425
01:16:05,240 --> 01:16:07,120
Besides, it wasn't cheap.

1426
01:16:07,520 --> 01:16:09,580
So, you're stuck with it.

1427
01:16:10,120 --> 01:16:12,020
So come on, let's go.

1428
01:16:12,320 --> 01:16:14,480
I am not going anywhere in this.

1429
01:16:15,020 --> 01:16:16,000
I'm changing back.

1430
01:16:16,540 --> 01:16:18,480
Ugh, you are impossible.

1431
01:16:20,060 --> 01:16:20,680
Alright.

1432
01:16:21,400 --> 01:16:22,700
Enjoying the view?

1433
01:16:23,260 --> 01:16:23,340
Oh.

1434
01:16:23,620 --> 01:16:24,660
Quick, now's your chance.

1435
01:16:25,040 --> 01:16:25,260
Yeah.

1436
01:16:25,880 --> 01:16:27,700
Before she does change, just say something.

1437
01:16:27,820 --> 01:16:28,220
Anything.

1438
01:16:33,300 --> 01:16:34,000
Hey, wait up.

1439
01:16:36,780 --> 01:16:37,940
Hey, wait up.

1440
01:16:39,040 --> 01:16:39,540
Cheers.

1441
01:16:40,180 --> 01:16:40,820
Hi.

1442
01:16:41,020 --> 01:16:41,620
Hey.

1443
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:44,600
I'm so embarrassed right now.

1444
01:16:44,760 --> 01:16:46,600
My friend made me put this stupid thing on.

1445
01:16:46,600 --> 01:16:47,780
You think I'm in?

1446
01:16:47,840 --> 01:16:48,080
Sorry.

1447
01:16:48,760 --> 01:16:49,360
One second.

1448
01:16:49,880 --> 01:16:50,780
Let me go change.

1449
01:16:52,900 --> 01:16:53,720
Hey, girl.

1450
01:16:54,860 --> 01:16:55,820
Oh, um...

1451
01:16:55,820 --> 01:16:57,340
I didn't think I'd get this far.

1452
01:16:58,180 --> 01:16:58,660
Um...

1453
01:16:58,660 --> 01:16:59,180
Whoa.

1454
01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:02,440
Don't worry, I got something.

1455
01:17:04,220 --> 01:17:05,520
For the beach, you know.

1456
01:17:06,220 --> 01:17:07,340
Oh, what?

1457
01:17:07,400 --> 01:17:07,880
That bikini?

1458
01:17:07,980 --> 01:17:08,520
I didn't even notice.

1459
01:17:08,900 --> 01:17:09,460
What's the worst?

1460
01:17:09,560 --> 01:17:11,440
I was hoping you would leave it on.

1461
01:17:11,580 --> 01:17:12,820
Your friend has good...

1462
01:17:12,820 --> 01:17:13,540
Oh.

1463
01:17:13,860 --> 01:17:14,420
Oh, what?

1464
01:17:14,720 --> 01:17:15,820
The bikini?

1465
01:17:17,280 --> 01:17:19,340
I didn't even notice, girl.

1466
01:17:21,980 --> 01:17:22,500
Somehow...

1467
01:17:22,500 --> 01:17:24,800
I'm not so sure I believe that.

1468
01:17:25,080 --> 01:17:26,860
Oh, you think I'm a liar?

1469
01:17:27,480 --> 01:17:28,000
Fuck.

1470
01:17:28,340 --> 01:17:29,400
You're all the same.

1471
01:17:33,700 --> 01:17:34,220
Okay.

1472
01:17:36,120 --> 01:17:36,640
Um...

1473
01:17:36,640 --> 01:17:37,840
Oh, so you're not...

1474
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:38,440
Like what?

1475
01:17:38,680 --> 01:17:39,200
Adorable?

1476
01:17:40,100 --> 01:17:41,060
Too late.

1477
01:17:41,940 --> 01:17:43,720
Shut up.

1478
01:17:44,640 --> 01:17:45,320
She laughed.

1479
01:17:45,720 --> 01:17:46,360
Oh my god.

1480
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:47,500
I'm in their minds.

1481
01:17:47,620 --> 01:17:48,600
I know what they want.

1482
01:17:48,600 --> 01:17:51,020
I know exactly what they want.

1483
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:00,380
Belly?

1484
01:18:00,740 --> 01:18:02,980
She gave me her name, guys.

1485
01:18:03,960 --> 01:18:04,580
She...

1486
01:18:04,580 --> 01:18:07,300
She gave me her name, guys.

1487
01:18:08,060 --> 01:18:09,980
Anyway, I wanna talk to Bell...

1488
01:18:09,980 --> 01:18:10,720
I wanna talk to her.

1489
01:18:11,220 --> 01:18:12,180
Sorry, Belly.

1490
01:18:14,260 --> 01:18:15,340
No, I'm kidding.

1491
01:18:15,540 --> 01:18:16,080
Alright.

1492
01:18:17,420 --> 01:18:18,300
Oh.

1493
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:20,440
Oh.

1494
01:18:22,560 --> 01:18:24,560
She's like obviously...

1495
01:18:24,560 --> 01:18:26,080
She's obviously like...

1496
01:18:26,900 --> 01:18:27,660
Romantic.

1497
01:18:28,320 --> 01:18:29,360
So like...

1498
01:18:29,360 --> 01:18:31,540
It's easy to know that...

1499
01:18:31,540 --> 01:18:33,260
She's gonna say...

1500
01:18:33,260 --> 01:18:34,340
Um...

1501
01:18:34,340 --> 01:18:38,760
I believe there's one special person out there for everyone.

1502
01:18:39,160 --> 01:18:40,400
I feel like...

1503
01:18:40,620 --> 01:18:42,160
That's what she wants to hear.

1504
01:18:43,720 --> 01:18:44,600
Um...

1505
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:45,460
Because like...

1506
01:18:45,460 --> 01:18:46,040
Three?

1507
01:18:46,520 --> 01:18:46,640
Really?

1508
01:18:47,520 --> 01:18:50,240
Alright, I'm gonna choose three and prove you guys wrong.

1509
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:52,460
You fuckers.

1510
01:18:52,560 --> 01:18:53,480
I'm gonna go get water.

1511
01:18:53,760 --> 01:18:54,580
You messed it up.

1512
01:18:54,840 --> 01:18:55,580
You ruined it.

1513
01:18:55,660 --> 01:18:56,700
You ruined it.

1514
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:57,460
You fucking...

1515
01:19:04,340 --> 01:19:05,880
I knew you guys would ruin it.

1516
01:19:05,940 --> 01:19:06,660
I fucking...

1517
01:19:06,660 --> 01:19:07,340
I knew...

1518
01:19:07,340 --> 01:19:09,640
I knew you guys would ruin this for me.

1519
01:19:09,960 --> 01:19:10,980
I fucking...

1520
01:19:10,980 --> 01:19:11,680
I knew it.

1521
01:19:11,880 --> 01:19:12,740
I knew...

1522
01:19:12,740 --> 01:19:13,860
I should've trusted my gut.

1523
01:19:14,160 --> 01:19:15,240
I should've trusted my gut.

1524
01:19:15,340 --> 01:19:15,840
I was like...

1525
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:17,160
Obviously, I know what you want.

1526
01:19:17,160 --> 01:19:18,360
You were only talking about...

1527
01:19:18,840 --> 01:19:19,340
True love.

1528
01:19:19,460 --> 01:19:20,900
And you say I had negative reviews?

1529
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:22,580
You fucking ruined it for me.

1530
01:19:29,230 --> 01:19:31,450
What the fuck do you mean one guy?

1531
01:19:31,650 --> 01:19:32,750
I saw like...

1532
01:19:32,750 --> 01:19:34,670
Ten people being like...

1533
01:19:34,670 --> 01:19:35,370
Choose three.

1534
01:19:35,870 --> 01:19:36,690
Choose three.

1535
01:19:41,510 --> 01:19:42,110
Um...

1536
01:19:42,850 --> 01:19:44,130
What's your favorite color?

1537
01:19:48,430 --> 01:19:49,030
Oh...

1538
01:19:49,030 --> 01:19:50,450
The lilac.

1539
01:19:54,850 --> 01:19:55,210
Um...

1540
01:19:55,570 --> 01:19:57,110
Hey, so like...

1541
01:19:57,110 --> 01:19:58,130
What do you do like...

1542
01:19:58,130 --> 01:19:58,730
For work?

1543
01:19:58,790 --> 01:20:00,030
I mean...

1544
01:20:01,390 --> 01:20:02,250
Oh, she's like...

1545
01:20:03,110 --> 01:20:05,870
She's all about fucking love!

1546
01:20:06,350 --> 01:20:07,650
She's yoga!

1547
01:20:11,710 --> 01:20:12,570
Oh my god.

1548
01:20:12,990 --> 01:20:13,710
Literally...

1549
01:20:13,710 --> 01:20:16,290
Her entire spiel is that she's into yoga.

1550
01:20:17,070 --> 01:20:18,850
You think she'll let me go on a date now?

1551
01:20:22,250 --> 01:20:23,770
Okay, what does she eat?

1552
01:20:23,990 --> 01:20:25,730
Okay, before I take her out...

1553
01:20:25,730 --> 01:20:27,710
I'm gonna take you out to a date anyway!

1554
01:20:27,750 --> 01:20:28,690
We can eat on a date!

1555
01:20:30,130 --> 01:20:31,430
Okay, junk food.

1556
01:20:31,790 --> 01:20:32,170
Alright.

1557
01:20:33,690 --> 01:20:34,170
Uh...

1558
01:20:34,170 --> 01:20:36,010
What is junky enough?

1559
01:20:36,930 --> 01:20:37,410
Uh...

1560
01:20:37,410 --> 01:20:38,090
Cotton candy.

1561
01:20:38,310 --> 01:20:39,010
Jesus Christ.

1562
01:20:39,010 --> 01:20:39,570
French fries.

1563
01:20:39,810 --> 01:20:40,930
That's junk food!

1564
01:20:41,450 --> 01:20:41,750
Alright.

1565
01:20:42,190 --> 01:20:42,570
Here you go.

1566
01:20:43,670 --> 01:20:44,150
Get...

1567
01:20:44,150 --> 01:20:44,650
Get on.

1568
01:20:44,650 --> 01:20:45,690
To the sea.

1569
01:20:48,950 --> 01:20:49,970
This is it.

1570
01:20:50,910 --> 01:20:52,330
Can't be that bad now.

1571
01:20:52,430 --> 01:20:53,410
We're out of the beach area.

1572
01:20:53,510 --> 01:20:54,510
Now we're playing tennis.

1573
01:20:56,170 --> 01:20:57,210
Oh, this fits!

1574
01:20:57,370 --> 01:20:57,870
Woah!

1575
01:20:58,110 --> 01:20:58,310
Okay!

1576
01:20:59,450 --> 01:20:59,810
Woah!

1577
01:21:04,850 --> 01:21:05,410
Okay.

1578
01:21:09,150 --> 01:21:09,710
Um...

1579
01:21:10,630 --> 01:21:11,910
What's her favorite color?

1580
01:21:14,590 --> 01:21:15,150
Guys...

1581
01:21:15,920 --> 01:21:17,810
What's her favorite color, guys?

1582
01:21:21,890 --> 01:21:23,530
She likes orange?

1583
01:21:23,810 --> 01:21:25,270
Alright, it's orange.

1584
01:21:26,930 --> 01:21:28,390
God, where's the...

1585
01:21:28,390 --> 01:21:28,570
Okay.

1586
01:21:29,250 --> 01:21:30,350
We're level one.

1587
01:21:30,450 --> 01:21:30,750
Okay.

1588
01:21:31,970 --> 01:21:33,130
This is fine.

1589
01:21:34,190 --> 01:21:35,590
This is...

1590
01:21:36,150 --> 01:21:37,790
This is fixable.

1591
01:21:38,670 --> 01:21:40,370
We can do this.

1592
01:21:41,150 --> 01:21:42,790
Alright, music.

1593
01:21:45,410 --> 01:21:48,380
And then...

1594
01:21:48,380 --> 01:21:50,820
Do we have any pinks we can do?

1595
01:21:51,560 --> 01:21:52,080
No.

1596
01:21:53,260 --> 01:21:54,600
This is fine.

1597
01:21:55,340 --> 01:21:56,580
Don't worry, guys.

1598
01:21:56,900 --> 01:21:58,600
It's not over yet!

1599
01:22:00,440 --> 01:22:01,240
150?

1600
01:22:01,900 --> 01:22:03,260
Holy shi- Okay.

1601
01:22:03,660 --> 01:22:04,680
No, we can...

1602
01:22:04,680 --> 01:22:05,520
This is salvageable.

1603
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:09,140
Fuck, okay.

1604
01:22:11,580 --> 01:22:12,380
Okay.

1605
01:22:14,960 --> 01:22:16,320
We can do this.

1606
01:22:16,640 --> 01:22:16,820
There.

1607
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:17,780
A combo.

1608
01:22:18,140 --> 01:22:20,840
And then we get an extra move and another combo!

1609
01:22:21,900 --> 01:22:25,880
Combo for fucking days!

1610
01:22:28,200 --> 01:22:29,420
And then what do I do?

1611
01:22:32,620 --> 01:22:34,400
It's not over yet!

1612
01:22:34,440 --> 01:22:35,840
You can't say it's over!

1613
01:22:35,980 --> 01:22:37,120
It's just begun!

1614
01:22:37,860 --> 01:22:40,240
I still have 14 moves left!

1615
01:22:42,980 --> 01:22:46,020
I'm literally gaming right now!

1616
01:22:49,380 --> 01:22:50,220
Alright.

1617
01:22:51,620 --> 01:22:52,800
Let's see.

1618
01:22:54,680 --> 01:22:55,720
We got this.

1619
01:22:56,680 --> 01:22:57,620
Oh my god!

1620
01:22:57,940 --> 01:22:58,760
She loves me.

1621
01:22:59,280 --> 01:23:01,060
And then I get an orange as well.

1622
01:23:01,900 --> 01:23:02,380
And...

1623
01:23:26,410 --> 01:23:28,790
I got too greedy.

1624
01:23:28,790 --> 01:23:31,110
I flew too close to the sun.

1625
01:23:37,140 --> 01:23:40,040
I flew too close to the sun.

1626
01:23:43,140 --> 01:23:43,860
No!

1627
01:23:44,720 --> 01:23:47,020
I thought this was true love.

1628
01:23:47,380 --> 01:23:51,580
If this was true love, she wouldn't break up with me like this.

1629
01:23:53,320 --> 01:23:55,720
I thought she loved me.

1630
01:23:58,580 --> 01:24:00,560
I thought she...

1631
01:24:00,560 --> 01:24:03,420
I thought I meant something to her.

1632
01:24:06,280 --> 01:24:07,460
Oh my god.

1633
01:24:07,680 --> 01:24:08,860
Was it all a lie?

1634
01:24:10,260 --> 01:24:12,740
Was everything a fucking lie?

1635
01:24:17,800 --> 01:24:22,240
Bro, she played with my heart!

1636
01:24:25,220 --> 01:24:28,600
Do you not know what love at first sight meant?

1637
01:24:28,600 --> 01:24:31,520
I thought this was love at first sight.

1638
01:24:31,720 --> 01:24:33,460
Clearly, she didn't.

1639
01:24:33,520 --> 01:24:35,600
She played with my fucking heart.

1640
01:24:43,140 --> 01:24:45,580
This was not meant to be.

1641
01:24:46,020 --> 01:24:48,260
This is not meant to be.

1642
01:24:51,080 --> 01:24:53,660
We would have made it by now.

1643
01:24:53,900 --> 01:24:56,960
We actually would have made it.

1644
01:24:57,260 --> 01:25:00,820
We would have made it twice.

1645
01:25:00,820 --> 01:25:02,880
If I didn't fumble.

1646
01:25:19,350 --> 01:25:24,940
Not only did I fumble once, I fumbled two times in a row.

1647
01:25:26,340 --> 01:25:28,420
I don't deserve these glasses.

1648
01:25:29,200 --> 01:25:29,820
I don't...

1649
01:25:29,820 --> 01:25:32,080
I don't deserve these, please.

1650
01:25:32,700 --> 01:25:35,940
We won't need the censorship at this rate.

1651
01:25:35,940 --> 01:25:37,480
What do you mean?

1652
01:25:39,040 --> 01:25:42,060
What do you do to calm down when somebody...

1653
01:25:42,060 --> 01:25:42,920
I cry.

1654
01:25:43,200 --> 01:25:44,140
Like, right now.

1655
01:25:46,980 --> 01:25:48,420
I try to...

1656
01:25:48,420 --> 01:25:52,540
But, like, because I know you're into yoga, I'm gonna lie to you.

1657
01:25:53,020 --> 01:25:54,900
This is what true love is, guys.

1658
01:25:55,120 --> 01:25:59,400
I try to relax and remember that nobody is perfect.

1659
01:26:02,100 --> 01:26:05,460
I know my real answer's not gonna make you happy.

1660
01:26:05,460 --> 01:26:07,600
I'm gonna lie to you.

1661
01:26:08,820 --> 01:26:10,540
Alright, let's see, food.

1662
01:26:11,720 --> 01:26:13,960
You like junk food and...

1663
01:26:13,960 --> 01:26:14,720
What did you like?

1664
01:26:15,380 --> 01:26:16,620
Junk food and...

1665
01:26:16,620 --> 01:26:18,420
I'm not gonna even talk to you anymore.

1666
01:26:18,560 --> 01:26:19,340
I'm gonna talk to...

1667
01:26:19,340 --> 01:26:20,660
I'm gonna talk to Aiko.

1668
01:26:22,240 --> 01:26:23,480
Oh my gosh, I...

1669
01:26:24,380 --> 01:26:26,020
I don't know, man.

1670
01:26:26,180 --> 01:26:26,560
I...

1671
01:26:29,580 --> 01:26:30,760
I don't...

1672
01:26:30,760 --> 01:26:32,460
I don't know, man.

1673
01:26:35,460 --> 01:26:36,720
Can we go on a date?

1674
01:26:38,280 --> 01:26:41,300
Oh, bro, she's not into this anymore.

1675
01:26:41,860 --> 01:26:42,460
She's...

1676
01:26:43,340 --> 01:26:44,600
Guys, I'm gonna...

1677
01:26:44,600 --> 01:26:45,140
I'm gonna...

1678
01:26:45,140 --> 01:26:46,960
I'm gonna do it, guys.

1679
01:26:47,860 --> 01:26:48,460
It's...

1680
01:26:48,460 --> 01:26:50,340
Oh, I can feel it.

1681
01:26:51,240 --> 01:26:51,840
I...

1682
01:26:51,840 --> 01:26:52,720
This is...

1683
01:26:52,720 --> 01:26:53,420
This is it.

1684
01:26:53,660 --> 01:26:54,460
I'm gonna...

1685
01:26:54,460 --> 01:26:57,120
I'm gonna do so well this time, guys.

1686
01:26:57,120 --> 01:26:58,300
This is...

1687
01:26:58,300 --> 01:27:00,260
Oh, this is it.

1688
01:27:00,340 --> 01:27:01,500
I can feel it.

1689
01:27:01,600 --> 01:27:04,160
I feel the passion rolling in.

1690
01:27:04,160 --> 01:27:07,420
I'm going so fast, nobody will know that...

1691
01:27:08,380 --> 01:27:10,360
I'm gonna go so fast.

1692
01:27:10,540 --> 01:27:12,500
What's the worst that can happen?

1693
01:27:16,380 --> 01:27:18,200
I'm desperate now.

1694
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:20,400
I'm so desperate.

1695
01:27:20,620 --> 01:27:21,380
She likes it.

1696
01:27:21,480 --> 01:27:23,520
She likes it when I'm desperate too.

1697
01:27:25,340 --> 01:27:26,120
Oh, shit.

1698
01:27:27,400 --> 01:27:28,160
Okay.

1699
01:27:28,540 --> 01:27:29,600
We'll do that.

1700
01:27:30,120 --> 01:27:33,020
And then...

1701
01:27:33,020 --> 01:27:35,240
Alright, I'm now making sure...

1702
01:27:35,240 --> 01:27:36,820
That I don't fuck this up.

1703
01:27:38,080 --> 01:27:38,780
This is good.

1704
01:27:38,860 --> 01:27:40,480
And then we get another one too.

1705
01:27:40,880 --> 01:27:42,020
And then...

1706
01:27:42,680 --> 01:27:43,700
Another one.

1707
01:27:44,860 --> 01:27:46,120
I'm doing it.

1708
01:27:46,600 --> 01:27:47,320
It's working.

1709
01:27:48,220 --> 01:27:48,800
It's...

1710
01:27:48,800 --> 01:27:49,480
It's working.

1711
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:50,880
She doesn't think I'm pathetic.

1712
01:27:51,540 --> 01:27:52,840
She doesn't...

1713
01:27:52,840 --> 01:27:53,800
It's...

1714
01:27:53,800 --> 01:27:54,840
Guys, it's working.

1715
01:27:57,680 --> 01:27:58,320
It's...

1716
01:27:58,320 --> 01:28:00,300
She doesn't think I'm pathetic, guys.

1717
01:28:01,340 --> 01:28:03,300
And even if she does...

1718
01:28:04,680 --> 01:28:07,260
Even if she does think I'm pathetic...

1719
01:28:07,260 --> 01:28:08,580
She likes that.

1720
01:28:08,800 --> 01:28:10,280
So, I'm winning technically.

1721
01:28:11,960 --> 01:28:12,600
Okay.

1722
01:28:13,260 --> 01:28:14,760
Is there any more reds I could do?

1723
01:28:15,020 --> 01:28:15,900
Okay, we're gonna do that.

1724
01:28:16,380 --> 01:28:17,520
I have 7 more moves.

1725
01:28:17,600 --> 01:28:18,300
This is...

1726
01:28:19,140 --> 01:28:20,120
This is possible.

1727
01:28:21,800 --> 01:28:23,080
Alright, 116.

1728
01:28:23,860 --> 01:28:25,140
This is possible.

1729
01:28:27,080 --> 01:28:29,220
I did not fumble it!

1730
01:28:30,300 --> 01:28:32,660
I still have 5 more moves!

1731
01:28:33,240 --> 01:28:33,720
No.

1732
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:34,760
Maybe I did.

1733
01:28:39,740 --> 01:28:40,420
Wait.

1734
01:28:41,440 --> 01:28:42,460
Don't say that.

1735
01:28:49,960 --> 01:28:50,900
I got bells?

1736
01:28:59,120 --> 01:28:59,800
Okay.

1737
01:29:03,100 --> 01:29:03,780
Okay.

1738
01:29:16,650 --> 01:29:19,290
And you chose the wrong bell, didn't I?

1739
01:29:23,170 --> 01:29:25,310
Guys, I think I chose the wrong bell.

1740
01:29:27,950 --> 01:29:28,970
Oh no.

1741
01:29:29,550 --> 01:29:30,950
Guys, there's no way.

1742
01:29:34,060 --> 01:29:36,260
Guys, I think I chose the wrong bell.

1743
01:29:36,700 --> 01:29:38,020
Guys, I...

1744
01:29:38,020 --> 01:29:39,300
I chose...

1745
01:29:39,300 --> 01:29:40,840
It's not over yet.

1746
01:29:40,960 --> 01:29:42,200
Guys, don't say that.

1747
01:29:42,400 --> 01:29:43,980
Don't say it's over, guys.

1748
01:29:44,060 --> 01:29:44,340
No.

1749
01:29:45,100 --> 01:29:46,280
Guys, it's fine.

1750
01:29:46,460 --> 01:29:47,560
We got this.

1751
01:29:48,620 --> 01:29:49,440
It's still...

1752
01:29:49,440 --> 01:29:50,360
It's salvageable.

1753
01:29:59,630 --> 01:30:00,490
I...

1754
01:30:07,240 --> 01:30:09,400
Why am I not going up?

1755
01:30:10,700 --> 01:30:11,540
Okay.

1756
01:30:12,920 --> 01:30:13,780
Okay.

1757
01:30:17,020 --> 01:30:17,450
Okay.

1758
01:30:21,450 --> 01:30:23,270
No, now I just have to think.

1759
01:30:27,070 --> 01:30:29,250
It's not over, guys.

1760
01:30:29,770 --> 01:30:31,250
Don't say that.

1761
01:30:31,770 --> 01:30:33,090
Don't say that!

1762
01:30:33,270 --> 01:30:34,630
I'm back in!

1763
01:30:34,710 --> 01:30:36,030
I'm fucking...

1764
01:30:42,140 --> 01:30:42,780
I...

1765
01:30:43,800 --> 01:30:44,840
Okay, no.

1766
01:30:45,500 --> 01:30:45,800
No.

1767
01:30:45,980 --> 01:30:46,700
No, no.

1768
01:30:46,760 --> 01:30:48,880
If I do that, this falls down.

1769
01:30:48,920 --> 01:30:49,260
No.

1770
01:30:49,600 --> 01:30:50,800
If I do that...

1771
01:30:51,300 --> 01:30:51,900
This...

1772
01:30:51,900 --> 01:30:52,760
Oh, if I do this...

1773
01:30:53,780 --> 01:30:54,400
If I...

1774
01:30:54,400 --> 01:30:55,600
If I do this...

1775
01:30:56,320 --> 01:30:57,060
It'll work.

1776
01:31:01,300 --> 01:31:01,940
It's...

1777
01:31:01,940 --> 01:31:02,800
I knew it.

1778
01:31:02,840 --> 01:31:04,560
I'm so fucking smart.

1779
01:31:05,720 --> 01:31:07,000
Holy shit.

1780
01:31:07,900 --> 01:31:09,500
I'm so smart.

1781
01:31:12,560 --> 01:31:13,820
I did it.

1782
01:31:14,300 --> 01:31:14,860
I...

1783
01:31:14,860 --> 01:31:15,680
I did it.

1784
01:31:16,600 --> 01:31:19,120
Who said I was gonna fumble that?

1785
01:31:19,800 --> 01:31:22,440
I used my brain, chat.

1786
01:31:22,780 --> 01:31:23,740
I actually...

1787
01:31:24,940 --> 01:31:26,060
Thought about...

1788
01:31:26,060 --> 01:31:28,840
I was 20 moves ahead of all of you.

1789
01:31:33,300 --> 01:31:34,540
I knew it.

1790
01:31:34,580 --> 01:31:36,220
I unlocked her air outfit?

1791
01:31:36,980 --> 01:31:38,060
How do I see her outfit?

1792
01:31:39,880 --> 01:31:40,440
Settings.

1793
01:31:41,040 --> 01:31:42,400
Oh, hey, I can turn this up.

1794
01:31:42,540 --> 01:31:43,760
Well, I didn't even realize that.

1795
01:31:44,640 --> 01:31:46,060
I guess I'll turn up the BGM.

1796
01:31:46,860 --> 01:31:48,160
Wait, I can make it easy?

1797
01:31:52,040 --> 01:31:54,840
Wait, I could've made it easy this entire time?

1798
01:31:58,220 --> 01:32:01,920
Wait, how do I look at outfits?

1799
01:32:02,740 --> 01:32:03,820
I wanna see her outfit.

1800
01:32:04,800 --> 01:32:05,780
Is it a good outfit?

1801
01:32:09,450 --> 01:32:09,930
Oh.

1802
01:32:11,770 --> 01:32:12,590
What's February?

1803
01:32:12,790 --> 01:32:13,970
Is this February air?

1804
01:32:17,670 --> 01:32:18,410
Is this February?

1805
01:32:20,550 --> 01:32:21,110
Hello!

1806
01:32:23,690 --> 01:32:24,570
I already...

1807
01:32:24,570 --> 01:32:26,010
She asked me all of this.

1808
01:32:27,570 --> 01:32:29,730
Did I ask her what her main hobby is?

1809
01:32:30,710 --> 01:32:31,270
Oh.

1810
01:32:31,710 --> 01:32:33,010
Oh, she's just like me.

1811
01:32:33,410 --> 01:32:34,950
But like, not the other stuff, guys.

1812
01:32:35,530 --> 01:32:36,650
Just that part.

1813
01:32:36,750 --> 01:32:37,550
Just that one thing.

1814
01:32:37,670 --> 01:32:38,530
Not the other...

1815
01:32:38,530 --> 01:32:39,070
Just that.

1816
01:32:39,930 --> 01:32:40,490
Just...

1817
01:32:41,890 --> 01:32:43,170
Just that part.

1818
01:32:50,090 --> 01:32:50,490
Alright.

1819
01:32:50,970 --> 01:32:51,830
Well, I knew that.

1820
01:32:51,910 --> 01:32:52,730
I knew she's a teacher.

1821
01:32:52,970 --> 01:32:53,590
So, it's like...

1822
01:32:53,590 --> 01:32:54,290
It's not...

1823
01:32:54,910 --> 01:32:56,890
That's not new to me.

1824
01:32:58,950 --> 01:33:00,190
She's not gonna ask me anything?

1825
01:33:01,070 --> 01:33:01,470
Oh!

1826
01:33:02,110 --> 01:33:02,890
When is your birthday?

1827
01:33:03,550 --> 01:33:05,030
So, I can get you a gift for your birthday.

1828
01:33:08,210 --> 01:33:09,010
Okay, guys.

1829
01:33:09,130 --> 01:33:10,350
I need you guys to remember that for me.

1830
01:33:10,750 --> 01:33:12,270
Guys, if you want me to...

1831
01:33:12,270 --> 01:33:15,770
If you want me to be successful for her, you gotta know this for me.

1832
01:33:16,050 --> 01:33:17,110
Alright, now we got...

1833
01:33:17,110 --> 01:33:17,970
Oh, she's sleeping?

1834
01:33:18,330 --> 01:33:19,130
What the fuck?

1835
01:33:19,210 --> 01:33:20,090
It's the evening!

1836
01:33:20,470 --> 01:33:21,330
Anyway, let's talk to her.

1837
01:33:27,810 --> 01:33:28,170
Alright.

1838
01:33:28,750 --> 01:33:30,250
Guys, I need you to remember that.

1839
01:33:30,290 --> 01:33:34,110
If you want me to score it with the prof, you guys need to remember this for me.

1840
01:33:49,410 --> 01:33:50,370
Of course.

1841
01:33:51,590 --> 01:33:52,410
What was I thinking?

1842
01:33:53,090 --> 01:33:53,850
I'm sorry, honey.

1843
01:33:54,050 --> 01:33:54,870
Won't happen again.

1844
01:33:55,430 --> 01:33:56,710
That's more like it.

1845
01:33:57,210 --> 01:33:58,410
How have you been, my darling?

1846
01:33:58,950 --> 01:33:59,830
Staying out of trouble?

1847
01:34:00,390 --> 01:34:02,930
Well, I try, but...

1848
01:34:02,930 --> 01:34:04,370
Trouble has a hard time staying out of trouble.

1849
01:34:04,370 --> 01:34:05,610
Oh, she's a bad girl!

1850
01:34:06,830 --> 01:34:08,530
So, I take it work is good?

1851
01:34:09,090 --> 01:34:09,850
Never better.

1852
01:34:09,970 --> 01:34:11,070
Wait, what does she do for work?

1853
01:34:11,610 --> 01:34:12,770
What's going on, girl?

1854
01:34:13,070 --> 01:34:14,590
Any new mischief to share?

1855
01:34:15,290 --> 01:34:16,910
Ugh, where do I start?

1856
01:34:17,410 --> 01:34:18,230
Hold that thought.

1857
01:34:18,230 --> 01:34:19,330
Have a seat.

1858
01:34:19,490 --> 01:34:20,990
I'm gonna go grab you a drink.

1859
01:34:21,050 --> 01:34:22,910
I wanna hear all about it.

1860
01:34:23,310 --> 01:34:26,410
I'd love to, but...

1861
01:34:26,410 --> 01:34:28,270
Yeah, I've got an early day tomorrow.

1862
01:34:28,490 --> 01:34:29,710
I just stopped in for a second.

1863
01:34:29,890 --> 01:34:31,110
She's no fun!

1864
01:34:32,090 --> 01:34:33,050
Don't worry!

1865
01:34:33,390 --> 01:34:35,610
That's what I'm here for, girlfriend!

1866
01:34:36,250 --> 01:34:37,030
Are you?

1867
01:34:37,590 --> 01:34:38,190
Rain check.

1868
01:34:38,750 --> 01:34:40,850
You're gonna make her drink by herself?

1869
01:34:41,010 --> 01:34:42,670
I'm gonna screw right in after that.

1870
01:34:42,770 --> 01:34:43,190
Yeah, yeah.

1871
01:34:43,770 --> 01:34:44,890
Get out of here already.

1872
01:34:45,130 --> 01:34:46,590
I'm gonna be like...

1873
01:34:46,590 --> 01:34:47,490
Hey, baby.

1874
01:34:47,490 --> 01:34:49,630
I heard you don't wanna drink alone.

1875
01:34:54,190 --> 01:34:56,090
Oh my God, she's a cougar!

1876
01:34:56,950 --> 01:34:57,570
I'm in.

1877
01:35:04,670 --> 01:35:06,470
Oh, wait!

1878
01:35:06,710 --> 01:35:07,410
Okay, okay.

1879
01:35:07,450 --> 01:35:08,550
I gotta be super forward.

1880
01:35:08,770 --> 01:35:09,030
Okay.

1881
01:35:09,930 --> 01:35:11,890
Hey, this is some nice...

1882
01:35:15,790 --> 01:35:17,490
Guys, this is too forward.

1883
01:35:17,670 --> 01:35:18,730
It's gonna work.

1884
01:35:19,170 --> 01:35:19,710
Damn.

1885
01:35:19,990 --> 01:35:21,890
That's just surprisingly nice.

1886
01:35:22,890 --> 01:35:24,950
Dude, she's acting really aggressive!

1887
01:35:26,230 --> 01:35:27,510
10 out of 10.

1888
01:35:29,870 --> 01:35:31,890
What can I say?

1889
01:35:33,870 --> 01:35:34,790
I'm the Rizly.

1890
01:35:42,830 --> 01:35:44,390
Oh my...

1891
01:35:44,390 --> 01:35:45,370
It worked.

1892
01:35:50,870 --> 01:35:51,910
Oh...

1893
01:35:55,540 --> 01:35:56,580
What's...

1894
01:35:56,580 --> 01:35:57,900
What are you having?

1895
01:36:00,520 --> 01:36:01,300
Oh yeah?

1896
01:36:01,500 --> 01:36:02,300
What are you having?

1897
01:36:07,640 --> 01:36:08,160
Whoa!

1898
01:36:15,280 --> 01:36:16,120
Actually...

1899
01:36:16,120 --> 01:36:16,820
Why don't...

1900
01:36:19,200 --> 01:36:19,820
You sick?

1901
01:36:20,680 --> 01:36:21,340
You sick?

1902
01:36:23,180 --> 01:36:24,280
You're a VTuber.

1903
01:36:24,700 --> 01:36:25,980
You can act.

1904
01:36:27,860 --> 01:36:28,660
Hey, girl.

1905
01:36:30,640 --> 01:36:31,480
Actually...

1906
01:36:31,480 --> 01:36:33,500
Why don't we get out of here?

1907
01:36:40,340 --> 01:36:40,760
Fuck!

1908
01:36:52,420 --> 01:36:53,820
No.

1909
01:36:58,080 --> 01:36:59,520
Too forward!

1910
01:37:00,180 --> 01:37:01,500
Too forward!

1911
01:37:04,820 --> 01:37:11,090
I already talked to her daughter?

1912
01:37:12,970 --> 01:37:13,670
Tiffany?!

1913
01:37:15,270 --> 01:37:18,950
She has daddy issues?!

1914
01:37:20,910 --> 01:37:21,830
Sorry.

1915
01:37:22,150 --> 01:37:24,170
Thank you for the super chat.

1916
01:37:24,650 --> 01:37:25,490
Thank you.

1917
01:37:25,630 --> 01:37:26,710
Thank you.

1918
01:37:27,390 --> 01:37:29,130
I can fix it.

1919
01:37:29,750 --> 01:37:31,130
I can fix it.

1920
01:37:32,810 --> 01:37:34,170
Don't worry.

1921
01:37:37,190 --> 01:37:38,810
You can cough.

1922
01:37:43,670 --> 01:37:44,650
I can't.

1923
01:37:45,330 --> 01:37:46,050
I can't.

1924
01:37:52,170 --> 01:37:53,090
Alright.

1925
01:37:56,470 --> 01:37:59,710
Long, lame question, but what's your favorite color?

1926
01:38:00,410 --> 01:38:01,190
So easy.

1927
01:38:04,470 --> 01:38:04,930
Alright.

1928
01:38:26,420 --> 01:38:28,480
What does she want from me?

1929
01:38:30,120 --> 01:38:30,740
Coward!

1930
01:38:31,140 --> 01:38:33,760
First, thank you for the magenta soup.

1931
01:38:34,180 --> 01:38:35,720
Thank you, thank you.

1932
01:38:38,160 --> 01:38:40,440
What do you want from me?

1933
01:38:41,380 --> 01:38:43,600
Ma'am, what do you want from me, ma'am?

1934
01:38:44,740 --> 01:38:45,840
You could...

1935
01:38:46,520 --> 01:38:47,140
Okay!

1936
01:38:47,980 --> 01:38:49,680
I can handle plenty.

1937
01:38:50,300 --> 01:38:50,680
Trouble.

1938
01:38:51,600 --> 01:38:52,880
Oh my god.

1939
01:38:54,180 --> 01:38:56,260
Oh my god, okay.

1940
01:38:57,140 --> 01:39:02,680
Would you like...

1941
01:39:03,200 --> 01:39:05,180
Would you like to go on...

1942
01:39:06,260 --> 01:39:07,760
A date?

1943
01:39:10,820 --> 01:39:13,700
I did it!

1944
01:39:14,200 --> 01:39:15,020
Yay!

1945
01:39:23,880 --> 01:39:27,020
Oh my god, we're in a hot spring.

1946
01:39:27,720 --> 01:39:30,880
We're in hot waters together.

1947
01:39:34,280 --> 01:39:36,080
This is what she likes, she's a cougar!

1948
01:39:36,600 --> 01:39:38,780
I'm just giving her what she wants.

1949
01:39:39,260 --> 01:39:42,680
I'm just giving her what she wants, she's a cougar.

1950
01:39:43,100 --> 01:39:45,380
She likes me being pathetic, guys.

1951
01:39:45,880 --> 01:39:47,080
I'm just acting.

1952
01:39:47,760 --> 01:39:48,180
Chat.

1953
01:39:48,180 --> 01:39:50,760
I'm literally... it's acting.

1954
01:39:50,940 --> 01:39:53,600
If you guys can't... I'm just acting, guys.

1955
01:39:55,200 --> 01:39:56,480
Guys, it was...

1956
01:39:56,720 --> 01:40:00,000
It's all just funny, hee-hah-hah acting.

1957
01:40:00,280 --> 01:40:01,020
It's not...

1958
01:40:01,020 --> 01:40:02,180
Guys, I swear...

1959
01:40:05,120 --> 01:40:06,360
It's all...

1960
01:40:06,360 --> 01:40:08,500
It's just all acting, guys.

1961
01:40:08,940 --> 01:40:09,620
I'm...

1962
01:40:09,620 --> 01:40:11,600
I know what I'm doing.

1963
01:40:15,700 --> 01:40:16,980
She's a cougar!

1964
01:40:16,980 --> 01:40:19,240
She wants me to be like that.

1965
01:40:19,340 --> 01:40:21,140
I'm just giving her what she wants.

1966
01:40:22,800 --> 01:40:24,600
Oh shit, okay.

1967
01:40:25,380 --> 01:40:27,340
Alright, I think convert this...

1968
01:40:27,340 --> 01:40:28,180
Oh, I need sensual.

1969
01:40:29,120 --> 01:40:29,960
Okay, we'll do that.

1970
01:40:30,560 --> 01:40:31,580
And then that.

1971
01:40:33,280 --> 01:40:34,640
And then...

1972
01:40:36,140 --> 01:40:37,160
Let's see...

1973
01:40:37,500 --> 01:40:39,260
And then we'll get the water here.

1974
01:40:40,140 --> 01:40:41,600
Oh, 180!

1975
01:40:42,140 --> 01:40:43,260
Oh god.

1976
01:40:43,260 --> 01:40:44,100
That's beautiful.

1977
01:40:46,180 --> 01:40:46,780
185.

1978
01:40:47,940 --> 01:40:49,140
Holy shit.

1979
01:40:53,700 --> 01:40:54,900
Okay, she...

1980
01:40:54,900 --> 01:40:57,260
Alright, okay, so she...

1981
01:40:57,900 --> 01:40:59,100
Oh, she...

1982
01:40:59,100 --> 01:41:00,680
She wants a lot.

1983
01:41:00,880 --> 01:41:02,440
She wants a lot from me.

1984
01:41:08,700 --> 01:41:09,900
Four red...

1985
01:41:09,900 --> 01:41:10,900
I missed the four!

1986
01:41:10,900 --> 01:41:11,320
No!

1987
01:41:12,960 --> 01:41:14,360
I was...

1988
01:41:14,360 --> 01:41:15,760
I was so shy.

1989
01:41:16,220 --> 01:41:18,080
I was so shy.

1990
01:41:18,600 --> 01:41:20,060
I didn't notice.

1991
01:41:21,840 --> 01:41:22,300
It's okay.

1992
01:41:22,660 --> 01:41:23,840
It's all fixable.

1993
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:25,660
Everything is fixable, guys.

1994
01:41:26,740 --> 01:41:28,440
We can fix all of this.

1995
01:41:31,640 --> 01:41:33,020
This is fine.

1996
01:41:34,100 --> 01:41:35,460
This is not fine.

1997
01:41:37,200 --> 01:41:38,040
This...

1998
01:41:38,760 --> 01:41:42,960
This is absolutely not fine at all.

1999
01:41:43,120 --> 01:41:44,220
It's over.

2000
01:41:44,340 --> 01:41:45,840
I ruined it already.

2001
01:41:47,280 --> 01:41:48,440
Oh no.

2002
01:41:49,140 --> 01:41:49,960
This is it.

2003
01:41:50,080 --> 01:41:53,040
Bro, 885?!

2004
01:41:59,410 --> 01:42:00,550
Ma'am...

2005
01:42:00,930 --> 01:42:01,810
I'm sorry.

2006
01:42:05,370 --> 01:42:07,330
You have so much experience.

2007
01:42:07,630 --> 01:42:08,850
I'm just a little guy.

2008
01:42:08,850 --> 01:42:10,570
I'm just a little...

2009
01:42:10,570 --> 01:42:11,810
I'm sorry.

2010
01:42:11,930 --> 01:42:13,250
I'm just a little guy.

2011
01:42:15,650 --> 01:42:17,470
Can I have five more moves, ma'am?

2012
01:42:19,130 --> 01:42:21,430
Please, can I have five more moves?

2013
01:42:23,910 --> 01:42:24,950
I'm just...

2014
01:42:24,950 --> 01:42:27,450
I'm trying to do my best, ma'am.

2015
01:42:27,530 --> 01:42:29,430
I'm trying so hard.

2016
01:42:30,170 --> 01:42:31,470
Oh my god, thank god.

2017
01:42:31,510 --> 01:42:32,270
There's a bell.

2018
01:42:33,470 --> 01:42:34,910
Okay, four more moves.

2019
01:42:35,150 --> 01:42:36,490
This is salvageable.

2020
01:42:37,530 --> 01:42:39,270
We can fix this.

2021
01:42:39,750 --> 01:42:42,030
Guys, we can always fix this.

2022
01:42:42,230 --> 01:42:44,490
We can always fix this.

2023
01:42:47,700 --> 01:42:48,800
Is there another bell?

2024
01:42:48,880 --> 01:42:50,720
There's no other bell, so I'm just gonna do this.

2025
01:42:51,720 --> 01:42:53,440
And then we have another passion.

2026
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:54,940
Here we go.

2027
01:42:55,940 --> 01:42:56,460
Okay.

2028
01:42:58,180 --> 01:42:59,120
Now I don't...

2029
01:42:59,120 --> 01:42:59,900
Oh wait, there's a four.

2030
01:43:02,180 --> 01:43:03,740
I love this.

2031
01:43:04,860 --> 01:43:06,220
Why did I do that?

2032
01:43:08,380 --> 01:43:10,100
I fumbled it.

2033
01:43:10,260 --> 01:43:13,240
I didn't realize that doesn't give me anything.

2034
01:43:15,020 --> 01:43:16,120
Oh my god.

2035
01:43:19,400 --> 01:43:20,080
Honestly,

2036
01:43:23,120 --> 01:43:23,200
hon.

2037
01:43:23,580 --> 01:43:26,060
Not exactly what I was hoping for.

2038
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:30,280
I'm an experience right now.

2039
01:43:30,480 --> 01:43:31,080
I'm like...

2040
01:43:31,080 --> 01:43:33,260
I'm so much younger than you.

2041
01:43:33,380 --> 01:43:34,960
What did you want from me?

2042
01:43:35,780 --> 01:43:37,780
You're supposed to teach me.

2043
01:43:39,900 --> 01:43:41,460
I thought I was a cool girl.

2044
01:43:41,540 --> 01:43:43,220
You're supposed to teach me.

2045
01:43:45,260 --> 01:43:46,080
She's coked.

2046
01:43:46,220 --> 01:43:46,660
She's back.

2047
01:43:46,820 --> 01:43:47,460
She's coked.

2048
01:43:47,640 --> 01:43:48,460
Airborne ninja.

2049
01:43:48,760 --> 01:43:49,880
Thank you for the superchat.

2050
01:43:49,920 --> 01:43:50,900
Thank you.

2051
01:43:52,500 --> 01:43:53,020
Okay.

2052
01:43:53,500 --> 01:43:54,880
Well, how I feel about piracy.

2053
01:43:55,040 --> 01:43:56,600
Other people on the side.

2054
01:43:58,360 --> 01:44:00,100
She can do whatever she wants.

2055
01:44:00,240 --> 01:44:01,700
I don't own her.

2056
01:44:02,360 --> 01:44:04,300
Is that pathetic enough for you?

2057
01:44:12,620 --> 01:44:13,500
Okay.

2058
01:44:14,600 --> 01:44:15,480
Okay.

2059
01:44:18,700 --> 01:44:19,580
Okay.

2060
01:44:20,040 --> 01:44:22,580
Let's upgrade this.

2061
01:44:24,660 --> 01:44:25,100
Okay.

2062
01:44:25,740 --> 01:44:26,660
Passion, right?

2063
01:44:29,620 --> 01:44:31,360
What do we do next guys?

2064
01:44:31,640 --> 01:44:33,160
What upgrade do we?

2065
01:44:33,860 --> 01:44:34,520
What?

2066
01:44:35,200 --> 01:44:37,140
Matara is not impressed.

2067
01:44:37,600 --> 01:44:38,840
Blake, thank you for the superchat.

2068
01:44:38,840 --> 01:44:40,820
Okay, what do we get?

2069
01:44:41,060 --> 01:44:41,700
Sexuality?

2070
01:44:42,220 --> 01:44:44,140
Alright, let's do sexuality.

2071
01:44:45,100 --> 01:44:46,660
Alright, let's talk.

2072
01:44:46,900 --> 01:44:48,240
Tiffany is still asleep.

2073
01:44:48,600 --> 01:44:49,920
We can talk to Belly again.

2074
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:52,640
Goodbye.

2075
01:44:54,160 --> 01:44:55,400
I'll get better.

2076
01:44:55,580 --> 01:44:56,920
I swear, ma'am.

2077
01:44:58,300 --> 01:45:01,120
I swear, I'll get better.

2078
01:45:04,060 --> 01:45:05,780
Oh shit, am I talking to you again?

2079
01:45:10,680 --> 01:45:11,200
Um...

2080
01:45:11,200 --> 01:45:13,260
You prefer one season over the other?

2081
01:45:14,420 --> 01:45:18,460
Oh, you like... Oh, I don't... Wait, did I already... Oh no, this is the same response.

2082
01:45:22,090 --> 01:45:22,610
Gifts?

2083
01:45:24,010 --> 01:45:25,570
What does gifts do, anyway?

2084
01:45:27,110 --> 01:45:28,170
Look for gifts?

2085
01:45:28,970 --> 01:45:30,570
Um, what would Tiffany want?

2086
01:45:34,170 --> 01:45:37,990
Dancer, academy, garden, sports, aquarium...

2087
01:45:37,990 --> 01:45:40,850
Mistletoe... Mistletoe...

2088
01:45:40,850 --> 01:45:44,850
Retro controller, cigarette pack...

2089
01:45:48,270 --> 01:45:49,430
Gives you gifts.

2090
01:45:49,910 --> 01:45:51,270
Gifts gives date help.

2091
01:45:51,410 --> 01:45:52,990
I... Oh, it does?

2092
01:45:55,140 --> 01:45:55,930
This one?

2093
01:45:59,490 --> 01:46:01,870
The yellow stars are like her likes.

2094
01:46:02,030 --> 01:46:02,330
Okay.

2095
01:46:03,510 --> 01:46:04,290
Um...

2096
01:46:04,290 --> 01:46:07,550
Alright, I'll get you tennis balls.

2097
01:46:08,830 --> 01:46:09,270
Hello.

2098
01:46:09,910 --> 01:46:11,990
I can't believe you bought this for me.

2099
01:46:12,230 --> 01:46:13,450
How nice is that?

2100
01:46:15,110 --> 01:46:15,850
You're welcome.

2101
01:46:16,670 --> 01:46:19,270
I don't know what else to say, I mean...

2102
01:46:19,810 --> 01:46:20,570
Want some balls?

2103
01:46:24,870 --> 01:46:27,150
Do you want some balls?

2104
01:46:27,290 --> 01:46:29,230
Like, I don't know, like...

2105
01:46:29,230 --> 01:46:29,910
I guess.

2106
01:46:30,410 --> 01:46:31,990
You have something to say.

2107
01:46:33,570 --> 01:46:34,710
We're due for like work.

2108
01:46:34,810 --> 01:46:36,090
Oh no, we know that she's a yoga teacher.

2109
01:46:36,330 --> 01:46:38,010
This is random, but how tall are you?

2110
01:46:38,010 --> 01:46:40,070
Just one inch shy of six feet.

2111
01:46:40,230 --> 01:46:41,350
Woah, she's fucking tall.

2112
01:46:42,230 --> 01:46:43,050
Giant woman.

2113
01:46:44,530 --> 01:46:46,050
Alright, we learned her height.

2114
01:46:46,530 --> 01:46:46,910
What else?

2115
01:46:47,130 --> 01:46:48,730
We don't need to go on a date anymore.

2116
01:46:49,750 --> 01:46:50,850
Oh, Tiffany, you're awake!

2117
01:46:50,910 --> 01:46:51,930
I just talked to your mom!

2118
01:46:52,030 --> 01:46:53,110
I fucked up, but like...

2119
01:46:53,870 --> 01:46:55,530
I'll get into the family somehow.

2120
01:46:59,770 --> 01:47:03,970
Hey, I didn't expect to see you here this early.

2121
01:47:23,790 --> 01:47:24,270
Alright.

2122
01:47:25,490 --> 01:47:26,430
I'm gonna talk to her.

2123
01:47:28,390 --> 01:47:28,870
Yeah?

2124
01:47:42,660 --> 01:47:44,860
Oh my god, she's so hard to read.

2125
01:47:45,740 --> 01:47:47,700
I legitimately don't know what she wants from me.

2126
01:47:53,750 --> 01:47:55,550
I don't know what she wants from me.

2127
01:47:56,470 --> 01:47:57,670
Oh, thank god, okay.

2128
01:47:58,500 --> 01:47:59,410
Oh, thank god.

2129
01:47:59,550 --> 01:48:02,730
So she wants a bad boy, but not that bad.

2130
01:48:03,070 --> 01:48:04,510
Okay, that's fine.

2131
01:48:04,770 --> 01:48:05,590
That's good to know.

2132
01:48:06,430 --> 01:48:08,150
She doesn't want a bad boy.

2133
01:48:08,850 --> 01:48:13,090
She wants a studious bad boy.

2134
01:48:13,810 --> 01:48:15,170
Alright, what do we upgrade?

2135
01:48:15,250 --> 01:48:15,550
Luck?

2136
01:48:15,910 --> 01:48:16,930
We fucking need it.

2137
01:48:18,010 --> 01:48:19,770
Oh my god, we fucking need luck.

2138
01:48:21,230 --> 01:48:23,050
Alright, second date!

2139
01:48:23,210 --> 01:48:24,230
Let's go!

2140
01:48:26,030 --> 01:48:27,850
What's the worst that could happen?

2141
01:48:30,810 --> 01:48:31,950
Gosh, she wants hiking.

2142
01:48:32,050 --> 01:48:32,850
I'm not talking to her.

2143
01:48:33,010 --> 01:48:33,490
Wow!

2144
01:48:34,630 --> 01:48:35,930
I love hiking.

2145
01:48:40,950 --> 01:48:44,490
Hey guys, have I ever told you how much I love hiking?

2146
01:48:51,150 --> 01:48:53,350
You can change my mind so fast.

2147
01:48:55,890 --> 01:48:57,590
Hiking's the best, guys.

2148
01:49:00,910 --> 01:49:03,350
I'm so passionate about it.

2149
01:49:05,350 --> 01:49:07,330
Let's see, 185.

2150
01:49:07,430 --> 01:49:09,290
Okay, we can figure it out.

2151
01:49:09,290 --> 01:49:10,390
Guys, I need help.

2152
01:49:12,570 --> 01:49:16,090
Guys, if you don't want me to fumble, we gotta work together.

2153
01:49:16,910 --> 01:49:19,090
Guys, this is a team game now.

2154
01:49:20,750 --> 01:49:24,290
This is a team Riz game.

2155
01:49:24,430 --> 01:49:26,790
We gotta Riz this together.

2156
01:49:30,490 --> 01:49:31,550
19 moves?

2157
01:49:31,670 --> 01:49:33,750
Okay, you know I can fuck this up, guys.

2158
01:49:33,890 --> 01:49:35,870
Don't say that.

2159
01:49:36,230 --> 01:49:38,830
If there's a will, there's a way.

2160
01:49:44,450 --> 01:49:46,910
Is there extra hearts anywhere?

2161
01:49:47,930 --> 01:49:50,170
Alright, I need it to be green.

2162
01:49:53,690 --> 01:49:55,250
There's nothing else to do.

2163
01:49:56,210 --> 01:49:58,010
There's only threes.

2164
01:49:58,530 --> 01:49:59,870
What do you mean do not do threes?

2165
01:49:59,990 --> 01:50:01,670
I don't have any other choice.

2166
01:50:02,410 --> 01:50:03,290
Except for this.

2167
01:50:03,570 --> 01:50:04,570
Boom, right here.

2168
01:50:05,710 --> 01:50:09,270
And then we have this right here.

2169
01:50:11,050 --> 01:50:12,550
And then... Bell?

2170
01:50:12,550 --> 01:50:14,510
I fucked up, didn't I?

2171
01:50:14,570 --> 01:50:17,070
I don't see... Oh, Bell, Bell, Bell.

2172
01:50:17,910 --> 01:50:18,510
Nice.

2173
01:50:19,290 --> 01:50:20,430
Okay, we got Bell.

2174
01:50:22,530 --> 01:50:23,730
And then...

2175
01:50:25,030 --> 01:50:26,710
No, that's not it.

2176
01:50:27,670 --> 01:50:28,950
Oh, that's it.

2177
01:50:31,070 --> 01:50:32,730
That's fucking it.

2178
01:50:33,510 --> 01:50:33,950
Okay.

2179
01:50:37,190 --> 01:50:39,170
Now we're... I'm gonna use it.

2180
01:50:39,290 --> 01:50:40,070
Oh, I need sentiment.

2181
01:50:40,370 --> 01:50:41,370
I need three, okay.

2182
01:50:42,770 --> 01:50:44,390
We can do this.

2183
01:50:44,790 --> 01:50:47,710
And then it's Bear time.

2184
01:50:51,030 --> 01:50:51,630
Four.

2185
01:50:51,930 --> 01:50:52,770
Nice, we got four.

2186
01:50:53,070 --> 01:50:54,690
See, I didn't fuck it up.

2187
01:50:56,330 --> 01:50:59,070
I didn't... I didn't fuck it up.

2188
01:51:02,190 --> 01:51:03,670
Wait, I fucked it up?

2189
01:51:03,790 --> 01:51:04,170
No!

2190
01:51:06,310 --> 01:51:08,570
I was so confident, too.

2191
01:51:08,570 --> 01:51:14,550
I was so confident, too.

2192
01:51:14,670 --> 01:51:17,530
I was like, look guys, I didn't fuck it up.

2193
01:51:18,290 --> 01:51:19,730
How could I?

2194
01:51:20,130 --> 01:51:22,430
How could I fuck this up, guys?

2195
01:51:22,850 --> 01:51:23,730
There's no way.

2196
01:51:27,230 --> 01:51:27,890
Salvageable.

2197
01:51:29,410 --> 01:51:30,310
Isn't that four hearts?

2198
01:51:32,950 --> 01:51:33,950
Isn't that four?

2199
01:51:33,950 --> 01:51:34,090
Four?

2200
01:51:37,790 --> 01:51:39,370
Oh, I fucked it up again?

2201
01:51:39,650 --> 01:51:40,210
It's okay.

2202
01:51:42,030 --> 01:51:44,990
Because I have four hearts right here.

2203
01:51:45,610 --> 01:51:47,130
I told you guys.

2204
01:51:51,750 --> 01:51:53,670
There's no more fires here.

2205
01:51:57,870 --> 01:51:58,820
What do I do?

2206
01:52:00,280 --> 01:52:00,980
I have five?

2207
01:52:01,640 --> 01:52:03,100
Where's the number five?

2208
01:52:04,780 --> 01:52:05,940
Blue and green?

2209
01:52:06,380 --> 01:52:06,820
Blue and green?

2210
01:52:07,260 --> 01:52:08,440
Where's blue and green?

2211
01:52:10,760 --> 01:52:11,640
There's four...

2212
01:52:14,260 --> 01:52:18,620
Guys, guys, don't do this to me, guys.

2213
01:52:19,520 --> 01:52:19,960
Guys.

2214
01:52:20,700 --> 01:52:23,920
Guys, I... Guys, you gotta... We gotta work this together, guys.

2215
01:52:24,020 --> 01:52:25,940
We have nine moves, we have to do this together.

2216
01:52:26,440 --> 01:52:27,840
Blue, bottom, right.

2217
01:52:28,940 --> 01:52:30,300
That's not four, that's three.

2218
01:52:31,260 --> 01:52:32,520
Guys, do you know how to count?

2219
01:52:36,760 --> 01:52:38,080
Guys, that's three!

2220
01:52:38,880 --> 01:52:40,080
That's three.

2221
01:52:40,840 --> 01:52:42,280
Blue on the... Here?

2222
01:52:42,420 --> 01:52:43,120
Like this?

2223
01:52:43,840 --> 01:52:45,120
How is that a combo?

2224
01:52:46,980 --> 01:52:48,060
Like this.

2225
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:50,520
I swear, I'm gonna do it.

2226
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:56,600
Okay.

2227
01:52:59,060 --> 01:53:00,920
Oh my god, I fucking knew it.

2228
01:53:01,040 --> 01:53:02,020
I'm so smart.

2229
01:53:02,220 --> 01:53:02,520
Wow.

2230
01:53:05,080 --> 01:53:07,360
Wait, it's... Wait, it's possible.

2231
01:53:07,360 --> 01:53:09,620
Oh my god, I'm so smart.

2232
01:53:09,940 --> 01:53:13,020
I'm so smart, I'm gonna get in the family somehow.

2233
01:53:14,900 --> 01:53:19,040
Guys, we're gonna make it into the family.

2234
01:53:19,560 --> 01:53:22,300
We're gonna make it to the family.

2235
01:53:22,800 --> 01:53:24,100
It's possible.

2236
01:53:24,780 --> 01:53:25,140
Okay.

2237
01:53:29,580 --> 01:53:30,860
Okay, what do we do?

2238
01:53:33,140 --> 01:53:34,260
Bottom, alright.

2239
01:53:34,620 --> 01:53:36,200
But it's not gonna increase anything.

2240
01:53:36,440 --> 01:53:37,660
We need points, guys.

2241
01:53:39,360 --> 01:53:41,060
Welcome to the family.

2242
01:53:41,840 --> 01:53:42,860
Guys, this...

2243
01:53:44,700 --> 01:53:47,040
Why you gotta make it weird?

2244
01:53:47,540 --> 01:53:47,800
Why?

2245
01:53:48,080 --> 01:53:49,340
It's not weird!

2246
01:53:49,880 --> 01:53:51,240
How is it weird?

2247
01:53:51,700 --> 01:53:54,720
I'm just... I'm just trying to play the game.

2248
01:53:56,040 --> 01:54:00,780
I'm just... I'm just trying to fucking... I'm trying to do my best here.

2249
01:54:00,780 --> 01:54:02,940
I'm trying so hard.

2250
01:54:07,610 --> 01:54:08,580
Now bell?

2251
01:54:08,800 --> 01:54:09,140
Where?

2252
01:54:09,400 --> 01:54:10,740
There's no bell anywhere.

2253
01:54:11,720 --> 01:54:13,120
What do you mean bell?

2254
01:54:14,780 --> 01:54:16,040
I don't see no...

2255
01:54:16,040 --> 01:54:16,040
Oh.

2256
01:54:18,820 --> 01:54:20,280
Guys, I saw the bell.

2257
01:54:21,510 --> 01:54:23,240
Oh my god, wait, it's possible.

2258
01:54:23,960 --> 01:54:25,040
Wait, okay.

2259
01:54:29,470 --> 01:54:30,210
Okay.

2260
01:54:31,090 --> 01:54:31,470
Okay.

2261
01:54:34,430 --> 01:54:35,750
Alright, guys.

2262
01:54:36,250 --> 01:54:36,850
Four hearts.

2263
01:54:37,010 --> 01:54:38,130
We don't need no hearts!

2264
01:54:38,930 --> 01:54:39,590
There's a four?

2265
01:54:40,130 --> 01:54:41,290
How is there four?

2266
01:54:41,350 --> 01:54:41,950
I'm counting!

2267
01:54:43,790 --> 01:54:44,830
That's a three?

2268
01:54:45,970 --> 01:54:47,130
That's a three?

2269
01:54:48,710 --> 01:54:51,050
Four light blue at the bottom?

2270
01:54:53,570 --> 01:54:53,890
That's...

2271
01:54:55,530 --> 01:54:57,750
Oh, thank god.

2272
01:54:58,030 --> 01:54:59,310
Oh my god, it's possible.

2273
01:55:00,190 --> 01:55:02,050
Oh my god, this is a team game, guys.

2274
01:55:03,050 --> 01:55:04,170
We did it.

2275
01:55:04,170 --> 01:55:05,630
I did it.

2276
01:55:08,290 --> 01:55:09,590
We're in.

2277
01:55:10,290 --> 01:55:11,430
I did it.

2278
01:55:14,830 --> 01:55:16,970
I fucking love hiking.

2279
01:55:19,790 --> 01:55:20,690
I...

2280
01:55:22,250 --> 01:55:26,450
I told you, I can riz, guys.

2281
01:55:27,290 --> 01:55:31,270
Guys, I fucking love hiking so much, guys.

2282
01:55:31,990 --> 01:55:32,390
Alright.

2283
01:55:34,350 --> 01:55:34,750
Wow!

2284
01:55:35,270 --> 01:55:37,610
I love hiking so much, guys.

2285
01:55:41,290 --> 01:55:41,690
Wow.

2286
01:55:41,690 --> 01:55:43,550
Hiking is my favorite activity.

2287
01:55:47,470 --> 01:55:51,950
If it helps get some more date gifts, go to the store and look for gifts with a heart beside them.

2288
01:55:52,290 --> 01:55:55,190
And give it to them, whatever girl you're seeing at the moment.

2289
01:55:55,250 --> 01:55:57,370
They'll show up in your invite as presents.

2290
01:55:57,770 --> 01:55:58,470
Thank you for the super chat.

2291
01:55:58,570 --> 01:55:59,390
Thank you, thank you.

2292
01:55:59,530 --> 01:56:00,090
Okay, alright.

2293
01:56:01,470 --> 01:56:03,450
What's your opinion on people who smoke?

2294
01:56:08,620 --> 01:56:11,320
I feel like you don't like smokers.

2295
01:56:11,920 --> 01:56:12,860
Oh, thank god.

2296
01:56:12,980 --> 01:56:14,800
You seem like a girl that doesn't smoke.

2297
01:56:15,340 --> 01:56:17,060
Okay, I don't understand her.

2298
01:56:17,120 --> 01:56:19,100
Does she like a bad boy or not?

2299
01:56:19,340 --> 01:56:20,460
I don't understand.

2300
01:56:20,760 --> 01:56:21,700
What does she want?

2301
01:56:31,220 --> 01:56:33,300
So, exactly how old are you?

2302
01:56:34,260 --> 01:56:34,540
Yeah.

2303
01:56:34,540 --> 01:56:35,280
Yeah.

2304
01:56:36,460 --> 01:56:37,340
Okay.

2305
01:56:38,080 --> 01:56:38,580
Alright.

2306
01:56:39,500 --> 01:56:42,180
And how old am I playing as?

2307
01:56:45,380 --> 01:56:47,620
Okay, let's find somebody else.

2308
01:56:48,180 --> 01:56:51,520
Oh, it's morning time.

2309
01:56:52,100 --> 01:56:52,500
Okay.

2310
01:56:53,280 --> 01:56:54,720
I have to be...

2311
01:56:56,140 --> 01:56:59,780
I have to be young because, like, she's a cougar.

2312
01:57:00,260 --> 01:57:02,080
And I'm also... There's two cougars.

2313
01:57:02,080 --> 01:57:06,520
So, like, I have to be young.

2314
01:57:06,680 --> 01:57:08,520
I just don't go to university, I guess.

2315
01:57:08,600 --> 01:57:09,420
I might be a dropout.

2316
01:57:09,960 --> 01:57:13,300
I might be a dropout.

2317
01:57:13,740 --> 01:57:14,200
New girl!

2318
01:57:14,320 --> 01:57:15,380
But we have four girls!

2319
01:57:15,460 --> 01:57:16,480
There's so many girls!

2320
01:57:16,920 --> 01:57:20,020
I don't know if I can handle so many girls, guys.

2321
01:57:20,200 --> 01:57:21,780
There's so many girls.

2322
01:57:22,140 --> 01:57:23,280
I love this picture.

2323
01:57:23,760 --> 01:57:24,310
This is a...

2324
01:57:30,120 --> 01:57:31,060
Oh, Tiffany.

2325
01:57:32,560 --> 01:57:33,860
Alright, let's gotcha.

2326
01:57:34,810 --> 01:57:35,960
Oh, thank God.

2327
01:57:38,380 --> 01:57:43,800
I was gonna be like, alright guys, it's gotcha time.

2328
01:57:44,860 --> 01:57:45,580
Okay.

2329
01:57:45,960 --> 01:57:47,320
Alright, thank God.

2330
01:57:49,600 --> 01:57:50,260
Okay.

2331
01:57:50,880 --> 01:57:51,660
But we're fine.

2332
01:57:54,400 --> 01:57:55,300
Hey!

2333
01:57:57,320 --> 01:57:58,060
That's me!

2334
01:57:59,690 --> 01:58:00,580
It's me.

2335
01:58:01,400 --> 01:58:02,800
That's me.

2336
01:58:04,340 --> 01:58:05,760
Alright, we'll buy Yo-Yo.

2337
01:58:05,920 --> 01:58:06,860
She likes Yo-Yo.

2338
01:58:07,560 --> 01:58:08,580
Can I just give this to her?

2339
01:58:09,320 --> 01:58:09,720
Yay!

2340
01:58:13,300 --> 01:58:14,480
She's gonna get me a gift!

2341
01:58:14,840 --> 01:58:15,220
Okay.

2342
01:58:15,480 --> 01:58:16,740
Wait, I'm so rich!

2343
01:58:16,840 --> 01:58:17,820
I might as well get her.

2344
01:58:18,380 --> 01:58:19,100
I'll get a pencil.

2345
01:58:19,580 --> 01:58:20,260
That's cheap.

2346
01:58:23,140 --> 01:58:24,500
I'm tolerable, guys!

2347
01:58:24,700 --> 01:58:25,060
I'm in.

2348
01:58:25,120 --> 01:58:25,800
I'm so in.

2349
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:32,720
Did I ask her how old is she?

2350
01:58:32,820 --> 01:58:34,060
Did I ask her what her favorite color is?

2351
01:58:36,800 --> 01:58:38,720
Oh, no, no, no.

2352
01:58:38,820 --> 01:58:41,120
I'm just so interested in you.

2353
01:58:41,840 --> 01:58:43,720
I'm so interested.

2354
01:58:47,820 --> 01:58:50,000
You're... I'm literally at your campus.

2355
01:58:50,540 --> 01:58:52,060
I'm not... Wait, no.

2356
01:58:52,080 --> 01:58:54,220
She thinks I'm stupid, so I'll be like...

2357
01:58:54,220 --> 01:58:55,580
Oh my gosh.

2358
01:58:55,920 --> 01:58:57,080
Are you a university professor?

2359
01:59:00,160 --> 01:59:00,940
What do you mean?

2360
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:02,300
I'm literally at your workplace.

2361
01:59:02,400 --> 01:59:03,280
I'm at the university.

2362
01:59:03,280 --> 01:59:05,160
There's only one university here.

2363
01:59:05,280 --> 01:59:07,440
There's only one.

2364
01:59:07,440 --> 01:59:07,740
Alright.

2365
01:59:08,040 --> 01:59:09,020
I'm ready.

2366
01:59:10,460 --> 01:59:11,920
I'm so ready.

2367
01:59:15,940 --> 01:59:17,740
This is it.

2368
01:59:18,660 --> 01:59:22,880
We're so... We can't... We're not gonna fumble this time.

2369
01:59:25,800 --> 01:59:27,500
This is it.

2370
01:59:27,900 --> 01:59:30,860
I forgot to get the gift, but this is it.

2371
01:59:32,400 --> 01:59:33,680
Guys, guys.

2372
01:59:33,800 --> 01:59:34,480
I forgot.

2373
01:59:34,760 --> 01:59:37,580
I forgot to get the gift, but this is it.

2374
01:59:38,240 --> 01:59:39,600
This is it.

2375
01:59:40,440 --> 01:59:42,360
Oh my god!

2376
01:59:43,180 --> 01:59:44,500
This is fine.

2377
01:59:46,660 --> 01:59:48,420
We can do this.

2378
01:59:49,340 --> 01:59:51,380
Guys, we can do this together.

2379
01:59:51,660 --> 01:59:53,640
This is a team game, guys.

2380
01:59:53,880 --> 01:59:55,780
Guys, it's not over.

2381
01:59:56,280 --> 01:59:59,540
Why is she... How did it get to 220?

2382
02:00:00,440 --> 02:00:02,440
How did we get here?

2383
02:00:06,560 --> 02:00:11,180
How did we get to 220?

2384
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:13,980
I don't understand.

2385
02:00:14,760 --> 02:00:16,620
How did we get there?

2386
02:00:18,440 --> 02:00:19,820
It's over.

2387
02:00:19,920 --> 02:00:21,340
We just started.

2388
02:00:22,160 --> 02:00:24,020
How can it be over?

2389
02:00:26,120 --> 02:00:27,120
More red?

2390
02:00:28,020 --> 02:00:30,780
Where the fuck... 1, 2, 3, 4...

2391
02:00:30,780 --> 02:00:33,100
Where is the 4 at?

2392
02:00:35,020 --> 02:00:36,780
Where do you see 4?

2393
02:00:38,360 --> 02:00:40,500
Where do you see a 4?

2394
02:00:47,680 --> 02:00:48,740
Am I stupid?

2395
02:00:52,680 --> 02:00:54,320
Don't answer that.

2396
02:00:55,900 --> 02:00:58,740
Where do you see the 4?

2397
02:00:59,440 --> 02:01:01,520
I'm so confused.

2398
02:01:02,440 --> 02:01:03,800
Oh, set up 4.

2399
02:01:03,940 --> 02:01:05,780
Where do you see 4 green?

2400
02:01:10,480 --> 02:01:11,100
How?

2401
02:01:13,340 --> 02:01:13,960
What?

2402
02:01:18,240 --> 02:01:19,780
I don't know where you see...

2403
02:01:20,300 --> 02:01:23,580
I'm looking at the same screen as you guys.

2404
02:01:24,240 --> 02:01:29,480
I'm looking at... I'm literally looking at the same game.

2405
02:01:30,860 --> 02:01:32,980
Orange swap with green.

2406
02:01:33,260 --> 02:01:34,960
There's so many oranges.

2407
02:01:36,580 --> 02:01:37,540
This?

2408
02:01:41,270 --> 02:01:42,430
Or this?

2409
02:01:42,670 --> 02:01:43,130
Wait, no.

2410
02:01:46,810 --> 02:01:47,910
Or this?

2411
02:01:49,610 --> 02:01:53,930
There's a 5... How are you reading 20 moves?

2412
02:01:53,930 --> 02:01:59,310
How do you... How do you read 20 moves ahead?

2413
02:02:00,330 --> 02:02:01,210
This.

2414
02:02:09,260 --> 02:02:09,900
Okay.

2415
02:02:13,160 --> 02:02:13,800
No!

2416
02:02:18,420 --> 02:02:22,620
Alright, now we're freestyling.

2417
02:02:24,460 --> 02:02:25,740
Okay, please.

2418
02:02:26,320 --> 02:02:27,700
What do you mean no?

2419
02:02:27,860 --> 02:02:29,640
I'm fucking... I'm trying to...

2420
02:02:29,640 --> 02:02:32,080
I was like this and one... I got one guy.

2421
02:02:32,180 --> 02:02:33,300
I literally saw a yes.

2422
02:02:33,500 --> 02:02:36,180
I swapped this over.

2423
02:02:36,740 --> 02:02:39,080
I can't let you ruin it.

2424
02:02:39,500 --> 02:02:43,220
I don't know what you want from me.

2425
02:02:44,060 --> 02:02:47,240
I'm not... I have my throwing.

2426
02:02:47,700 --> 02:02:49,660
I'm doing the best I could.

2427
02:02:51,220 --> 02:02:53,300
I'm trying to play.

2428
02:02:55,800 --> 02:02:58,760
It's over before it begun.

2429
02:02:59,160 --> 02:03:01,240
I don't understand.

2430
02:03:07,020 --> 02:03:08,960
I'm gonna do it.

2431
02:03:09,160 --> 02:03:11,820
I'm gonna fucking do it.

2432
02:03:12,180 --> 02:03:13,960
I'm fucking... Oh my god.

2433
02:03:15,880 --> 02:03:16,620
I...

2434
02:03:18,360 --> 02:03:19,480
Don't... Please stop.

2435
02:03:19,600 --> 02:03:19,800
Stop.

2436
02:03:19,960 --> 02:03:21,540
Please, I'm overthinking now.

2437
02:03:21,740 --> 02:03:22,360
Four reds.

2438
02:03:22,380 --> 02:03:23,320
I don't see this.

2439
02:03:23,520 --> 02:03:26,280
The four red fuckers you're talking about.

2440
02:03:26,800 --> 02:03:28,140
I don't see.

2441
02:03:28,300 --> 02:03:29,000
I'm blind.

2442
02:03:29,540 --> 02:03:30,440
I'm putting...

2443
02:03:30,960 --> 02:03:31,520
No.

2444
02:03:32,220 --> 02:03:33,720
The reds said...

2445
02:03:33,720 --> 02:03:34,300
Stop!

2446
02:03:34,900 --> 02:03:36,120
I don't know!

2447
02:03:37,740 --> 02:03:39,700
I love my beach.

2448
02:03:39,760 --> 02:03:41,500
One of my anime games.

2449
02:03:41,500 --> 02:03:43,660
Rainbow, thank you for the super chat.

2450
02:03:43,720 --> 02:03:44,040
Thank you.

2451
02:03:44,120 --> 02:03:44,600
Thank you.

2452
02:03:44,720 --> 02:03:45,280
Like this?

2453
02:03:45,360 --> 02:03:45,880
I'm gonna do it.

2454
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:47,120
I'm gonna fucking do it.

2455
02:03:47,180 --> 02:03:47,740
That's too late.

2456
02:03:48,060 --> 02:03:49,380
Now there's no more four reds.

2457
02:03:49,420 --> 02:03:50,800
Now you'll never get four reds.

2458
02:03:50,880 --> 02:03:52,020
I'm gonna... I'm freestyle.

2459
02:03:52,440 --> 02:03:53,520
I'm freestyling.

2460
02:03:53,600 --> 02:03:54,500
You can't stop me.

2461
02:03:54,540 --> 02:03:56,300
I'm gonna fucking freestyle now.

2462
02:03:57,220 --> 02:03:58,740
Oh, you can't stop me.

2463
02:03:58,840 --> 02:03:59,400
That's right.

2464
02:03:59,680 --> 02:04:00,520
I'm freestyle.

2465
02:04:00,760 --> 02:04:02,380
I'm going wild now.

2466
02:04:04,180 --> 02:04:05,060
That's right.

2467
02:04:05,300 --> 02:04:06,860
You can't stop me.

2468
02:04:06,880 --> 02:04:08,860
I'm freestyling this.

2469
02:04:08,860 --> 02:04:09,800
That's...

2470
02:04:10,760 --> 02:04:11,920
It's over.

2471
02:04:15,480 --> 02:04:18,260
She's over the edge, guys.

2472
02:04:18,360 --> 02:04:19,780
It's over now.

2473
02:04:20,500 --> 02:04:23,220
It's so...

2474
02:04:24,500 --> 02:04:26,400
No, let her cook.

2475
02:04:26,900 --> 02:04:27,480
No!

2476
02:04:28,480 --> 02:04:28,980
No!

2477
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:31,000
That's right.

2478
02:04:31,360 --> 02:04:34,900
I'm going in with no idea what I'm doing now.

2479
02:04:35,740 --> 02:04:37,840
That's fucking right.

2480
02:04:37,840 --> 02:04:40,520
No one will know what I'm doing.

2481
02:04:44,520 --> 02:04:45,560
That's right.

2482
02:04:45,920 --> 02:04:47,600
Head empty time.

2483
02:04:48,880 --> 02:04:50,380
Alright, now I don't know.

2484
02:04:50,560 --> 02:04:51,820
Now I'm a little stuck now.

2485
02:04:56,700 --> 02:04:58,020
No way.

2486
02:04:58,660 --> 02:04:59,140
No.

2487
02:04:59,940 --> 02:05:02,460
Alright, let's... Now I don't know anymore.

2488
02:05:03,880 --> 02:05:07,180
This freestyle has gone out of control.

2489
02:05:11,480 --> 02:05:12,600
This freestyle...

2490
02:05:12,600 --> 02:05:15,820
The freestyle has gone out of control, guys.

2491
02:05:15,980 --> 02:05:18,600
I'm at a point where I don't know what I'm doing no more.

2492
02:05:19,100 --> 02:05:23,380
I can't fuck me over, right?

2493
02:05:23,500 --> 02:05:24,240
Oh, thank God.

2494
02:05:24,320 --> 02:05:24,600
Okay.

2495
02:05:26,140 --> 02:05:26,700
Okay.

2496
02:05:27,660 --> 02:05:30,080
Now I'm definitely lost.

2497
02:05:32,460 --> 02:05:33,460
Now...

2498
02:05:34,300 --> 02:05:38,020
Now we have... Now we have a problem.

2499
02:05:38,600 --> 02:05:41,340
Now we have a problem.

2500
02:05:42,380 --> 02:05:44,460
Oh wait, unless...

2501
02:05:46,560 --> 02:05:47,600
Yeah.

2502
02:05:48,060 --> 02:05:48,520
Yeah!

2503
02:05:50,240 --> 02:05:51,280
Okay.

2504
02:05:52,980 --> 02:05:54,020
Yeah!

2505
02:05:55,300 --> 02:05:56,340
Okay.

2506
02:06:00,400 --> 02:06:02,140
Okay, now what?

2507
02:06:05,320 --> 02:06:06,520
Wait, I'm cooking.

2508
02:06:08,460 --> 02:06:10,120
Wait a minute.

2509
02:06:14,920 --> 02:06:17,140
Wait a minute, I'm actually doing something.

2510
02:06:19,280 --> 02:06:19,920
Wait.

2511
02:06:22,840 --> 02:06:24,340
How did we get here?

2512
02:06:24,720 --> 02:06:28,540
How did we get here?

2513
02:06:29,400 --> 02:06:31,500
Now I don't know what to do anymore.

2514
02:06:32,300 --> 02:06:33,720
Blue in the corner?

2515
02:06:36,140 --> 02:06:37,560
Blue in the corner?

2516
02:06:39,060 --> 02:06:41,640
That doesn't get me anything.

2517
02:06:49,560 --> 02:06:51,620
The bottom right bell?

2518
02:06:56,430 --> 02:06:57,590
Okay,

2519
02:07:03,760 --> 02:07:04,480
please.

2520
02:07:11,960 --> 02:07:13,360
Oh!

2521
02:07:40,380 --> 02:07:42,440
Absolute cinema.

2522
02:07:46,840 --> 02:07:48,240
Freestyle.

2523
02:07:56,240 --> 02:07:57,480
That's right!

2524
02:07:57,960 --> 02:08:00,300
The freestyle worked!

2525
02:08:00,460 --> 02:08:01,940
I told you!

2526
02:08:02,600 --> 02:08:03,880
I fucking...

2527
02:08:03,880 --> 02:08:06,640
Nobody believed me!

2528
02:08:07,060 --> 02:08:10,080
Nobody believed me.

2529
02:08:10,780 --> 02:08:13,020
I told you the freestyle.

2530
02:08:18,260 --> 02:08:21,340
An empty strack actually worked.

2531
02:08:21,780 --> 02:08:23,600
Alan, thank you for the super chat.

2532
02:08:23,700 --> 02:08:24,640
Thank you, thank you.

2533
02:08:25,080 --> 02:08:27,240
This stream is making me fall into alcoholism.

2534
02:08:27,960 --> 02:08:29,600
Doki, how did this work?

2535
02:08:30,140 --> 02:08:31,480
Thank you for the super chat.

2536
02:08:31,580 --> 02:08:32,680
Thank you, thank you.

2537
02:08:34,480 --> 02:08:35,880
Ace, thank you for the super chat.

2538
02:08:35,960 --> 02:08:40,840
I like how people are super chatting me about how to play the game.

2539
02:08:43,460 --> 02:08:47,340
By the way, you buy the girl's drinks, they give you more points when you talk to them.

2540
02:08:47,340 --> 02:08:48,100
Thank you for the super chat.

2541
02:08:48,180 --> 02:08:49,180
Thank you, thank you.

2542
02:08:49,620 --> 02:08:51,000
It was just...

2543
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:52,540
That was just that easy, guys.

2544
02:08:53,200 --> 02:08:54,580
What can I say?

2545
02:08:54,820 --> 02:08:56,640
I'm just naturally goaded.

2546
02:08:57,460 --> 02:08:58,500
I'm just...

2547
02:08:58,500 --> 02:09:00,480
I'm just a natural gamer.

2548
02:09:04,540 --> 02:09:05,880
Alright, sake.

2549
02:09:06,220 --> 02:09:06,940
Where's sake?

2550
02:09:07,120 --> 02:09:07,880
Oh, there it is.

2551
02:09:08,440 --> 02:09:09,440
Alright, here.

2552
02:09:10,880 --> 02:09:12,820
Oh my God, let's talk to her.

2553
02:09:14,160 --> 02:09:14,500
Hello.

2554
02:09:14,500 --> 02:09:14,740
Hello.

2555
02:09:16,200 --> 02:09:17,120
When is your birthday?

2556
02:09:20,060 --> 02:09:21,100
Oh, fuck you!

2557
02:09:21,320 --> 02:09:21,900
Oh, shit!

2558
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:25,040
Oh, fuck.

2559
02:09:25,480 --> 02:09:26,740
You want some gifts?

2560
02:09:26,840 --> 02:09:27,640
I'm so sorry.

2561
02:09:32,660 --> 02:09:33,900
There's so many...

2562
02:09:33,900 --> 02:09:36,440
Guys, there's so many girls.

2563
02:09:39,860 --> 02:09:41,620
Oh my God, okay.

2564
02:09:41,860 --> 02:09:42,400
That's fine.

2565
02:09:42,400 --> 02:09:43,720
Oh, fuck.

2566
02:09:43,800 --> 02:09:47,180
I can't handle all these women!

2567
02:09:47,600 --> 02:09:49,480
I have...

2568
02:09:49,480 --> 02:09:54,840
You guys wanted me to talk to a fifth woman, and I couldn't even...

2569
02:09:55,980 --> 02:09:58,240
I didn't remember her birthday.

2570
02:09:58,400 --> 02:09:59,180
There's just...

2571
02:09:59,180 --> 02:10:00,440
There's too many women.

2572
02:10:01,300 --> 02:10:03,460
There's just too many women.

2573
02:10:05,220 --> 02:10:06,720
Four is so many.

2574
02:10:07,360 --> 02:10:09,040
Guys, four is so many.

2575
02:10:09,400 --> 02:10:10,700
You don't understand.

2576
02:10:17,540 --> 02:10:17,980
There's...

2577
02:10:18,860 --> 02:10:19,740
There's four...

2578
02:10:19,740 --> 02:10:21,140
There's four women.

2579
02:10:24,180 --> 02:10:25,880
There's so many women.

2580
02:10:26,560 --> 02:10:27,600
There's so many...

2581
02:10:28,240 --> 02:10:30,120
You want to be a girl in a game?

2582
02:10:30,220 --> 02:10:31,440
You can change it.

2583
02:10:31,560 --> 02:10:32,800
Bonkers, thank you for the super chat.

2584
02:10:33,080 --> 02:10:34,400
Thank you for the very first super chat.

2585
02:10:34,480 --> 02:10:35,400
Thank you.

2586
02:10:38,760 --> 02:10:39,200
Okay.

2587
02:10:40,320 --> 02:10:41,480
Guys, I don't...

2588
02:10:41,480 --> 02:10:42,380
Guys, I don't know...

2589
02:10:42,380 --> 02:10:44,140
Guys, I...

2590
02:10:44,140 --> 02:10:46,800
I don't know if...

2591
02:10:46,800 --> 02:10:48,620
I can add more women...

2592
02:10:48,620 --> 02:10:49,800
in my repertoire.

2593
02:10:50,120 --> 02:10:51,260
Guys, there's...

2594
02:10:51,260 --> 02:10:53,240
I'm getting a little overwhelmed.

2595
02:10:53,460 --> 02:10:55,560
She gave me high heels?

2596
02:10:55,800 --> 02:10:56,140
Okay.

2597
02:10:59,200 --> 02:11:03,800
In the future, all Riz will be randomly generated.

2598
02:11:04,360 --> 02:11:05,640
Thank you for the super chat.

2599
02:11:05,760 --> 02:11:06,000
Thank you.

2600
02:11:08,200 --> 02:11:08,860
Alright.

2601
02:11:08,860 --> 02:11:09,080
Alright.

2602
02:11:10,640 --> 02:11:12,200
Guys, no, there's...

2603
02:11:12,200 --> 02:11:15,040
Guys, I don't know if I can handle more.

2604
02:11:15,200 --> 02:11:15,900
I...

2605
02:11:15,900 --> 02:11:21,080
I don't know if I can get a fifth one into this equation.

2606
02:11:21,300 --> 02:11:21,680
Guys.

2607
02:11:23,360 --> 02:11:24,080
There's...

2608
02:11:24,080 --> 02:11:25,400
There's eleven?

2609
02:11:31,100 --> 02:11:32,420
Thank you for the super chat.

2610
02:11:32,520 --> 02:11:33,560
Thank you.

2611
02:11:33,720 --> 02:11:35,020
Skill issue.

2612
02:11:35,760 --> 02:11:38,180
Oh, it's night time?

2613
02:11:38,820 --> 02:11:44,640
So I have learned from that is that Doki is a freestyle genius and that Doki would not be able to handle a harem.

2614
02:11:45,100 --> 02:11:46,060
Guys, I...

2615
02:11:46,060 --> 02:11:48,460
Guys, two was already too much.

2616
02:11:49,600 --> 02:11:50,080
Like...

2617
02:11:58,750 --> 02:11:59,230
Okay.

2618
02:11:59,490 --> 02:12:00,790
Wait, we have to equip it?

2619
02:12:01,530 --> 02:12:02,850
I already had it equipped.

2620
02:12:04,330 --> 02:12:05,390
How do I equip it?

2621
02:12:06,470 --> 02:12:08,110
Guys, how do I equip gifts?

2622
02:12:13,080 --> 02:12:14,980
How do I...

2623
02:12:15,600 --> 02:12:16,960
Oh, move it down?

2624
02:12:19,420 --> 02:12:19,920
What?

2625
02:12:21,500 --> 02:12:23,220
Drag it to the bottom?

2626
02:12:23,700 --> 02:12:24,600
Like here?

2627
02:12:25,100 --> 02:12:26,480
It won't let me equip it.

2628
02:12:30,220 --> 02:12:31,680
I'm dragging it.

2629
02:12:34,290 --> 02:12:35,130
I'm so...

2630
02:12:35,130 --> 02:12:35,410
Okay.

2631
02:12:37,410 --> 02:12:38,790
Alright, here we...

2632
02:12:38,790 --> 02:12:40,650
Alright, we did it, boys.

2633
02:12:41,470 --> 02:12:43,530
We learned how to use a phone.

2634
02:12:49,040 --> 02:12:49,540
Guys.

2635
02:12:49,900 --> 02:12:50,180
Guys.

2636
02:12:50,260 --> 02:12:51,220
We did the bare minimum.

2637
02:12:51,420 --> 02:12:52,260
We learned how to use...

2638
02:12:52,260 --> 02:12:53,020
Guys, it's over.

2639
02:12:53,160 --> 02:12:54,820
We learned how to use a fucking phone.

2640
02:12:56,800 --> 02:13:00,000
We learned how to use a fucking phone.

2641
02:13:00,460 --> 02:13:00,680
Okay.

2642
02:13:02,480 --> 02:13:03,560
Guys, I'm...

2643
02:13:03,560 --> 02:13:05,640
Alright, what should we upgrade?

2644
02:13:06,240 --> 02:13:07,960
Guys, what's the best next upgrade?

2645
02:13:14,860 --> 02:13:16,440
Guys, what do we get?

2646
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:18,560
Passion?

2647
02:13:18,560 --> 02:13:19,120
Passion.

2648
02:13:19,380 --> 02:13:20,720
Okay, we got passion.

2649
02:13:21,260 --> 02:13:23,060
Next up is a snow globe, apparently.

2650
02:13:23,680 --> 02:13:24,460
Wait, I have a message?

2651
02:13:25,780 --> 02:13:27,020
Well, fuck me.

2652
02:13:27,020 --> 02:13:29,320
I finally won something at the casino.

2653
02:13:29,580 --> 02:13:34,080
Great, now maybe I can put a tiny dent in my massive debt.

2654
02:13:35,340 --> 02:13:36,580
Alright, I'm ready.

2655
02:13:39,600 --> 02:13:40,500
Okay, I'm ready.

2656
02:13:44,960 --> 02:13:47,040
Okay, now you're scaring me.

2657
02:13:48,080 --> 02:13:49,300
Oh, it's safe?

2658
02:13:49,760 --> 02:13:51,880
Alright, let's go gambling, guys.

2659
02:13:54,160 --> 02:13:54,880
Guys.

2660
02:13:57,040 --> 02:13:58,280
Let's go gambling!

2661
02:13:58,280 --> 02:13:59,740
Oh, thank God.

2662
02:14:01,540 --> 02:14:03,860
This is the riskiest gamble.

2663
02:14:04,220 --> 02:14:07,180
Every photo is a new gamble.

2664
02:14:07,700 --> 02:14:09,080
Every fucking photo.

2665
02:14:09,340 --> 02:14:10,060
Okay, we're good.

2666
02:14:10,480 --> 02:14:11,260
We're okay.

2667
02:14:11,860 --> 02:14:12,620
We're okay.

2668
02:14:12,860 --> 02:14:14,520
Everything is fine.

2669
02:14:21,990 --> 02:14:23,710
What did I ask her?

2670
02:14:24,490 --> 02:14:25,730
Guys, I...

2671
02:14:25,730 --> 02:14:26,790
What's your favorite?

2672
02:14:27,490 --> 02:14:28,770
Oh, thank God.

2673
02:14:28,990 --> 02:14:30,870
There's so many women I talked to already.

2674
02:14:32,290 --> 02:14:33,490
Oh, thank God.

2675
02:14:33,590 --> 02:14:34,830
Okay, date time!

2676
02:14:35,570 --> 02:14:36,410
Date time!

2677
02:14:38,610 --> 02:14:39,690
Let's go!

2678
02:14:39,910 --> 02:14:41,010
Date time!

2679
02:14:42,010 --> 02:14:43,130
Date time!

2680
02:14:43,990 --> 02:14:45,910
Look, none of them asked me to go steady.

2681
02:14:47,790 --> 02:14:49,890
None of them asked me to go steady, so it's fine.

2682
02:14:52,730 --> 02:14:53,290
Oh!

2683
02:14:55,230 --> 02:14:55,790
260?!

2684
02:14:55,790 --> 02:14:56,830
Okay.

2685
02:15:01,290 --> 02:15:04,070
Matches made that is just other than the one you selected.

2686
02:15:05,130 --> 02:15:09,130
Increase the set amount of broken hearts that fall by for the remainder of the date.

2687
02:15:10,670 --> 02:15:12,630
Consume a select row of tokens.

2688
02:15:12,930 --> 02:15:15,730
Broken hearts...

2689
02:15:18,740 --> 02:15:19,260
Green?!

2690
02:15:21,300 --> 02:15:21,820
Green?!

2691
02:15:25,940 --> 02:15:28,520
Guys, I don't know if I can freestyle this, guys.

2692
02:15:29,560 --> 02:15:30,700
Guys, I...

2693
02:15:31,860 --> 02:15:34,960
Guys, we have a little problem here.

2694
02:15:34,960 --> 02:15:39,140
Freestyling for 260 is...

2695
02:15:39,140 --> 02:15:39,840
Okay.

2696
02:15:40,960 --> 02:15:41,600
Alright.

2697
02:15:42,240 --> 02:15:43,460
We're gonna freestyle.

2698
02:15:44,380 --> 02:15:45,530
We're gonna...

2699
02:15:45,720 --> 02:15:46,460
Okay.

2700
02:15:47,400 --> 02:15:48,900
We got the bell.

2701
02:15:49,400 --> 02:15:50,140
Alright.

2702
02:15:51,740 --> 02:15:54,960
How did I fuck it up already?!

2703
02:15:57,980 --> 02:15:58,840
I...

2704
02:16:00,730 --> 02:16:02,200
I'm getting that heart.

2705
02:16:02,200 --> 02:16:03,360
Fuck it.

2706
02:16:04,740 --> 02:16:08,360
How did I already fuck it up?!

2707
02:16:08,360 --> 02:16:09,240
That's it.

2708
02:16:09,760 --> 02:16:10,700
That's it!

2709
02:16:11,020 --> 02:16:12,140
We're going!

2710
02:16:14,340 --> 02:16:15,780
That's it!

2711
02:16:17,800 --> 02:16:19,240
That's it!

2712
02:16:22,580 --> 02:16:23,860
That's it!

2713
02:16:24,400 --> 02:16:26,420
No more playing around.

2714
02:16:26,420 --> 02:16:26,780
No.

2715
02:16:32,660 --> 02:16:34,100
It's over.

2716
02:16:38,710 --> 02:16:39,490
It's over.

2717
02:16:40,010 --> 02:16:43,670
It only took one guy to make me go nuclear.

2718
02:16:47,510 --> 02:16:49,790
It's already over.

2719
02:16:49,790 --> 02:16:50,790
It's...

2720
02:16:50,790 --> 02:16:53,730
Why did she...

2721
02:16:53,730 --> 02:16:55,570
It's so...

2722
02:16:55,570 --> 02:16:56,390
It's...

2723
02:16:57,210 --> 02:16:59,610
It's not going so well, guys.

2724
02:16:59,710 --> 02:17:00,630
I already...

2725
02:17:00,630 --> 02:17:02,350
I already blew up.

2726
02:17:02,770 --> 02:17:04,750
I already...

2727
02:17:04,750 --> 02:17:05,630
Alright.

2728
02:17:08,890 --> 02:17:10,170
Alright.

2729
02:17:11,310 --> 02:17:13,210
We're at plus four.

2730
02:17:15,370 --> 02:17:16,730
Here we go.

2731
02:17:17,970 --> 02:17:19,110
Okay.

2732
02:17:19,110 --> 02:17:19,290
Okay.

2733
02:17:20,330 --> 02:17:21,850
This is not good.

2734
02:17:23,050 --> 02:17:23,730
This...

2735
02:17:23,730 --> 02:17:26,850
This is a little awkward now.

2736
02:17:29,030 --> 02:17:29,890
It's okay.

2737
02:17:30,010 --> 02:17:31,330
I get another bell.

2738
02:17:31,470 --> 02:17:32,170
That's fine.

2739
02:17:34,930 --> 02:17:36,030
That's okay.

2740
02:17:37,470 --> 02:17:38,870
Oh, thank God.

2741
02:17:39,830 --> 02:17:41,090
Oh, thank God.

2742
02:17:41,390 --> 02:17:42,710
Okay, we're gonna get more sentiment.

2743
02:17:44,770 --> 02:17:49,970
Let's grab some sentiment and then let's grab an extra turn so it's like I didn't make a mistake there.

2744
02:17:50,650 --> 02:17:52,530
And then...

2745
02:17:57,450 --> 02:17:58,510
Okay.

2746
02:17:59,470 --> 02:18:00,010
Okay.

2747
02:18:00,730 --> 02:18:02,010
Let's use an item.

2748
02:18:03,350 --> 02:18:05,230
Guys, are any of these items good?

2749
02:18:05,350 --> 02:18:05,810
Guys?

2750
02:18:06,190 --> 02:18:06,830
Guys?

2751
02:18:07,470 --> 02:18:08,250
Guys, please.

2752
02:18:08,430 --> 02:18:09,910
This is an SOS right now.

2753
02:18:10,050 --> 02:18:10,430
Guys.

2754
02:18:10,950 --> 02:18:13,390
Are any of these good?

2755
02:18:14,110 --> 02:18:15,730
Like, five red?

2756
02:18:15,930 --> 02:18:16,450
Where?

2757
02:18:17,590 --> 02:18:19,330
I can't count to five?

2758
02:18:28,540 --> 02:18:29,040
Okay.

2759
02:18:29,540 --> 02:18:33,900
You will not lose any moves until a match is made as of a different than the one you selected.

2760
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:34,460
Let's do it.

2761
02:18:35,740 --> 02:18:37,140
So how do I do this?

2762
02:18:37,240 --> 02:18:37,500
Okay.

2763
02:18:45,440 --> 02:18:46,900
Let's get the orange.

2764
02:18:48,140 --> 02:18:49,220
Get the hearts?

2765
02:18:49,780 --> 02:18:50,260
Really?

2766
02:18:53,020 --> 02:18:55,440
Do we get red or...

2767
02:18:55,440 --> 02:18:56,040
Red?

2768
02:18:56,040 --> 02:18:56,920
Red?

2769
02:18:58,960 --> 02:18:59,600
Red!

2770
02:19:02,200 --> 02:19:03,340
What did I do?

2771
02:19:10,960 --> 02:19:11,600
Wait.

2772
02:19:11,920 --> 02:19:12,760
I clicked red.

2773
02:19:15,700 --> 02:19:17,080
What did I do?

2774
02:19:19,500 --> 02:19:21,140
Oh, do your reds now!

2775
02:19:21,340 --> 02:19:21,660
Oh!

2776
02:19:21,960 --> 02:19:22,220
Oh!

2777
02:19:22,400 --> 02:19:22,780
Oh!

2778
02:19:23,640 --> 02:19:24,280
Okay.

2779
02:19:25,460 --> 02:19:26,720
I'll do this first.

2780
02:19:28,960 --> 02:19:30,240
And then...

2781
02:19:33,670 --> 02:19:34,530
I do this.

2782
02:19:34,930 --> 02:19:36,090
I do this.

2783
02:19:36,850 --> 02:19:37,830
Which red do I do?

2784
02:19:41,950 --> 02:19:43,490
Right or bottom?

2785
02:19:44,270 --> 02:19:45,870
Right or bottom?

2786
02:19:48,290 --> 02:19:50,370
Right or bottom, guys?

2787
02:19:51,290 --> 02:19:52,510
Right or bottom?

2788
02:19:55,190 --> 02:19:57,570
Guys, okay, now we used it all up.

2789
02:19:57,610 --> 02:19:58,850
Alright, that's fine.

2790
02:19:59,930 --> 02:20:01,010
Okay, now we're fucked.

2791
02:20:02,790 --> 02:20:03,430
Now!

2792
02:20:03,430 --> 02:20:03,710
Now!

2793
02:20:04,790 --> 02:20:05,850
This is over.

2794
02:20:06,590 --> 02:20:08,370
Now we can say it's over.

2795
02:20:11,350 --> 02:20:12,890
Guys, who let me freestyle?

2796
02:20:13,690 --> 02:20:14,990
Who do we blame for this?

2797
02:20:15,030 --> 02:20:16,150
Because it's not my fault.

2798
02:20:20,770 --> 02:20:22,490
Who do we blame...

2799
02:20:22,490 --> 02:20:24,170
For making me have a breakdown?

2800
02:20:28,550 --> 02:20:30,370
We gotta blame somebody.

2801
02:20:30,370 --> 02:20:36,370
If that one person didn't make me have a breakdown there...

2802
02:20:36,370 --> 02:20:38,810
This would've been salvageable.

2803
02:20:45,440 --> 02:20:47,160
Green from the left?

2804
02:20:48,360 --> 02:20:50,200
How the fuck were you counting five?

2805
02:20:54,230 --> 02:20:55,450
That's three.

2806
02:20:58,290 --> 02:20:59,830
One, two, three.

2807
02:21:01,370 --> 02:21:01,780
This?

2808
02:21:02,830 --> 02:21:03,830
Oh, shit!

2809
02:21:04,530 --> 02:21:05,230
Okay.

2810
02:21:08,930 --> 02:21:09,630
Alright.

2811
02:21:11,510 --> 02:21:12,870
It's working?

2812
02:21:14,650 --> 02:21:18,330
Guys, I blame the guy that made me have a breakdown there.

2813
02:21:18,510 --> 02:21:25,590
I blame whoever made me have a breakdown.

2814
02:21:26,270 --> 02:21:27,330
That's on you.

2815
02:21:31,200 --> 02:21:32,490
That's on you.

2816
02:21:32,490 --> 02:21:34,010
Okay, we could've saved this.

2817
02:21:37,890 --> 02:21:39,870
No, blame yourself.

2818
02:21:44,240 --> 02:21:45,380
Oh, thank God.

2819
02:21:45,460 --> 02:21:46,480
Okay, we have a move.

2820
02:21:47,360 --> 02:21:48,860
We can still fix this.

2821
02:21:50,920 --> 02:21:52,240
This is like...

2822
02:21:52,240 --> 02:21:53,600
Guys, this is so scary.

2823
02:21:55,280 --> 02:21:56,700
Oh, shit, no!

2824
02:21:57,060 --> 02:21:57,560
Wait, no!

2825
02:21:59,580 --> 02:22:00,740
That was...

2826
02:22:00,740 --> 02:22:01,900
That could've...

2827
02:22:01,900 --> 02:22:03,400
We could've fucked up.

2828
02:22:07,040 --> 02:22:09,320
We almost fucked it up.

2829
02:22:09,620 --> 02:22:13,620
But it's okay, we didn't.

2830
02:22:13,760 --> 02:22:14,760
And that's all that matters.

2831
02:22:15,640 --> 02:22:17,780
We salvaged it.

2832
02:22:18,240 --> 02:22:20,280
We salvaged it.

2833
02:22:27,650 --> 02:22:29,150
There's another orange here.

2834
02:22:34,350 --> 02:22:35,450
Five hearts?

2835
02:22:35,450 --> 02:22:36,450
Oh, shit, you're right.

2836
02:22:39,030 --> 02:22:40,110
Alright, nice.

2837
02:22:40,790 --> 02:22:43,010
Okay, now we're maxed.

2838
02:22:48,450 --> 02:22:48,830
Alright.

2839
02:22:51,530 --> 02:22:54,010
Let's figure this out, guys, as a team.

2840
02:22:56,230 --> 02:22:57,350
But we do tier.

2841
02:22:57,470 --> 02:22:59,110
It's not gonna hit 260, though.

2842
02:23:00,270 --> 02:23:01,330
Five tiers doesn't...

2843
02:23:01,330 --> 02:23:03,110
Does five tiers build it up?

2844
02:23:03,910 --> 02:23:04,370
Chat?

2845
02:23:05,550 --> 02:23:07,230
Does that give us points?

2846
02:23:12,600 --> 02:23:13,740
We don't need sentiment, guys.

2847
02:23:13,860 --> 02:23:15,140
I need love.

2848
02:23:15,640 --> 02:23:17,400
We don't need sentiment.

2849
02:23:17,840 --> 02:23:19,840
We need love.

2850
02:23:28,730 --> 02:23:30,790
C10 to C18.

2851
02:23:33,610 --> 02:23:36,230
Oh my fucking god.

2852
02:23:37,750 --> 02:23:40,810
Guys, but what about love?

2853
02:23:42,930 --> 02:23:45,170
Love is important.

2854
02:23:46,030 --> 02:23:46,790
Okay.

2855
02:23:47,290 --> 02:23:50,250
How do we do this?

2856
02:23:50,330 --> 02:23:51,190
We got this.

2857
02:23:51,670 --> 02:23:52,970
Select our target.

2858
02:23:53,210 --> 02:23:53,450
Okay.

2859
02:23:54,190 --> 02:23:56,250
Clearly, we want the...

2860
02:23:56,250 --> 02:23:58,770
Okay, guys, we need to figure this out.

2861
02:23:59,330 --> 02:24:00,130
Five green?

2862
02:24:01,890 --> 02:24:02,590
Where?

2863
02:24:05,050 --> 02:24:07,290
What is love?

2864
02:24:08,470 --> 02:24:09,650
Where's five?

2865
02:24:09,770 --> 02:24:11,230
Where do you see five?

2866
02:24:11,230 --> 02:24:12,330
I see two.

2867
02:24:14,270 --> 02:24:16,310
Green into a big combo.

2868
02:24:16,550 --> 02:24:16,830
Where?

2869
02:24:18,010 --> 02:24:19,570
L-shaped green.

2870
02:24:23,270 --> 02:24:23,870
Here?

2871
02:24:24,750 --> 02:24:26,290
Oh shit, I see it.

2872
02:24:26,950 --> 02:24:29,090
No, if we do that, we get the hearts.

2873
02:24:29,330 --> 02:24:30,770
Guys, no, that's a bad.

2874
02:24:31,270 --> 02:24:32,250
That's a bad.

2875
02:24:32,350 --> 02:24:38,850
If we do this, these fall down, and then we get all the negative hearts.

2876
02:24:42,110 --> 02:24:43,730
Wait, top row?

2877
02:24:46,070 --> 02:24:47,770
The second row?

2878
02:24:48,210 --> 02:24:50,530
If we do this...

2879
02:24:50,530 --> 02:24:51,810
How?

2880
02:24:55,660 --> 02:24:57,120
They don't?

2881
02:25:01,340 --> 02:25:03,000
They don't.

2882
02:25:04,320 --> 02:25:05,180
No, they do.

2883
02:25:05,620 --> 02:25:06,560
No, they don't.

2884
02:25:07,700 --> 02:25:09,980
I can't see stuff.

2885
02:25:12,280 --> 02:25:13,180
Okay.

2886
02:25:13,180 --> 02:25:13,380
Okay.

2887
02:25:14,260 --> 02:25:15,680
You're right, I am blind.

2888
02:25:21,290 --> 02:25:22,670
I'm blind, guys.

2889
02:25:23,490 --> 02:25:24,810
I am actually blind.

2890
02:25:25,410 --> 02:25:27,730
I might as well be... Oh my god, that was so close.

2891
02:25:27,950 --> 02:25:29,370
That was actually so close.

2892
02:25:29,450 --> 02:25:31,410
I almost could have fucked that up right there.

2893
02:25:31,650 --> 02:25:33,250
That was actually so close.

2894
02:25:33,290 --> 02:25:33,830
Holy shit.

2895
02:25:34,070 --> 02:25:35,130
I almost did it.

2896
02:25:35,390 --> 02:25:37,290
I almost autopiloted that.

2897
02:25:37,290 --> 02:25:38,150
I...

2898
02:25:39,990 --> 02:25:41,590
I actually...

2899
02:25:41,590 --> 02:25:43,250
I almost just go...

2900
02:25:43,250 --> 02:25:46,790
Right here.

2901
02:25:51,180 --> 02:25:51,590
Okay.

2902
02:25:53,050 --> 02:25:54,270
That was...

2903
02:25:54,270 --> 02:25:59,630
That was almost an autopilot mistake there, but we fucking powered through.

2904
02:26:00,980 --> 02:26:01,750
Oh my god.

2905
02:26:02,170 --> 02:26:02,790
Fucking...

2906
02:26:02,790 --> 02:26:05,330
Easiest game of my fucking life.

2907
02:26:10,320 --> 02:26:11,120
Easy.

2908
02:26:11,600 --> 02:26:12,880
I did it.

2909
02:26:13,160 --> 02:26:15,360
I fucking did it.

2910
02:26:15,880 --> 02:26:17,840
Are you for real?

2911
02:26:25,900 --> 02:26:27,860
Guys, she said I'm perfect.

2912
02:26:28,440 --> 02:26:28,900
Guys.

2913
02:26:29,840 --> 02:26:31,060
She said I'm perfect.

2914
02:26:31,880 --> 02:26:34,700
My fake personality that I crafted just for her.

2915
02:26:35,740 --> 02:26:36,620
It's perfect.

2916
02:26:41,000 --> 02:26:43,820
I'm basically like Ratatouille-ing this.

2917
02:26:44,000 --> 02:26:46,500
Chat is like the fucking rat on my head at the moment.

2918
02:26:47,340 --> 02:26:48,260
Oh shit.

2919
02:26:50,600 --> 02:26:52,520
Do you think she'll be okay if I ask her cup size?

2920
02:26:53,660 --> 02:26:54,440
Oh, thank god.

2921
02:26:55,100 --> 02:26:56,620
Thank... This is true love.

2922
02:27:02,520 --> 02:27:04,660
Holy shit, are they all D cups?

2923
02:27:06,460 --> 02:27:07,380
Jesus Christ.

2924
02:27:08,560 --> 02:27:10,120
Are you all D cups?

2925
02:27:11,120 --> 02:27:12,760
Oh, I should get her alcohol.

2926
02:27:13,060 --> 02:27:14,200
Wait, what's...

2927
02:27:14,200 --> 02:27:15,000
Is she like wine?

2928
02:27:15,200 --> 02:27:16,620
Oh, of course, because you're a classy girl.

2929
02:27:17,020 --> 02:27:18,340
Guys, I'm not meeting another girl.

2930
02:27:18,460 --> 02:27:18,980
I can't.

2931
02:27:19,220 --> 02:27:19,620
I...

2932
02:27:19,620 --> 02:27:21,300
I could barely survive.

2933
02:27:24,840 --> 02:27:26,100
You like wine.

2934
02:27:28,360 --> 02:27:29,560
You don't want wine?

2935
02:27:35,640 --> 02:27:36,440
Yoga instructor.

2936
02:27:36,440 --> 02:27:38,640
Yoga instructor.

2937
02:27:38,720 --> 02:27:41,700
That's the only thing I remember from these women.

2938
02:27:42,260 --> 02:27:44,240
What they do for a living.

2939
02:27:45,140 --> 02:27:45,980
I'm sorry.

2940
02:27:46,420 --> 02:27:47,640
I can't remember.

2941
02:27:48,060 --> 02:27:49,240
I legitimately...

2942
02:27:49,240 --> 02:27:52,160
I legitimately can't remember like...

2943
02:27:52,160 --> 02:27:52,720
What...

2944
02:27:52,720 --> 02:27:56,280
What their favorite colors are.

2945
02:27:56,420 --> 02:27:58,520
I can't even remember like...

2946
02:27:58,520 --> 02:28:00,140
Other people's favorite colors.

2947
02:28:00,400 --> 02:28:01,840
I can't, guys.

2948
02:28:02,080 --> 02:28:04,680
I cannot do five girls.

2949
02:28:04,680 --> 02:28:06,680
Guys, you don't understand.

2950
02:28:08,420 --> 02:28:10,320
Five is just too many.

2951
02:28:10,940 --> 02:28:11,940
It's just...

2952
02:28:11,940 --> 02:28:13,900
It's just too many.

2953
02:28:14,320 --> 02:28:15,340
Oh, my God.

2954
02:28:15,840 --> 02:28:17,640
Oh, my God.

2955
02:28:18,100 --> 02:28:22,200
My bestie took this picture in class when I wasn't looking.

2956
02:28:22,760 --> 02:28:23,220
Uh-oh.

2957
02:28:23,460 --> 02:28:24,320
Panty shot.

2958
02:28:24,480 --> 02:28:25,500
So embarrassing.

2959
02:28:25,900 --> 02:28:27,800
But let me send it to you.

2960
02:28:28,480 --> 02:28:29,160
Okay.

2961
02:28:29,380 --> 02:28:32,780
I'm gonna predict where the panty shot is.

2962
02:28:32,780 --> 02:28:35,000
Right here.

2963
02:28:41,570 --> 02:28:42,710
Okay.

2964
02:28:42,850 --> 02:28:44,610
This is like...

2965
02:28:44,610 --> 02:28:46,070
We were all...

2966
02:28:46,070 --> 02:28:47,430
We were close.

2967
02:28:48,510 --> 02:28:50,850
We were so close.

2968
02:28:51,510 --> 02:28:53,410
Let's just...

2969
02:28:53,410 --> 02:28:54,430
There we go.

2970
02:28:57,520 --> 02:28:58,090
Okay.

2971
02:28:58,810 --> 02:28:59,290
All right.

2972
02:28:59,630 --> 02:29:00,510
Wow.

2973
02:29:00,510 --> 02:29:00,850
Wow.

2974
02:29:01,110 --> 02:29:03,170
That was...

2975
02:29:03,170 --> 02:29:04,050
Wow.

2976
02:29:04,470 --> 02:29:05,530
What a good friend.

2977
02:29:05,870 --> 02:29:06,850
That's all I could say.

2978
02:29:07,590 --> 02:29:09,410
What a great friend.

2979
02:29:12,130 --> 02:29:12,610
Okay.

2980
02:29:13,270 --> 02:29:13,910
All right.

2981
02:29:16,610 --> 02:29:17,090
From...

2982
02:29:17,090 --> 02:29:18,330
From the other girl.

2983
02:29:19,070 --> 02:29:20,470
It's so nice out this morning.

2984
02:29:20,570 --> 02:29:22,670
We should go for a walk in the park one of these days.

2985
02:29:22,790 --> 02:29:23,810
I'd love to have company.

2986
02:29:24,090 --> 02:29:25,110
Oh, my God.

2987
02:29:25,110 --> 02:29:27,130
What a nice girl.

2988
02:29:27,370 --> 02:29:29,110
What a nice demure girl.

2989
02:29:29,490 --> 02:29:30,930
Five is just too many.

2990
02:29:30,970 --> 02:29:33,650
One is too many for you, Doki.

2991
02:29:34,010 --> 02:29:35,790
Thank you for the super chat.

2992
02:29:35,930 --> 02:29:36,910
Thank you, thank you.

2993
02:29:37,270 --> 02:29:38,570
Blondie, thank you for the super chat.

2994
02:29:38,670 --> 02:29:39,490
Thank you, thank you.

2995
02:29:39,890 --> 02:29:44,990
Never thought watching someone else go on a date would be more successful than actually going on a date.

2996
02:29:45,330 --> 02:29:46,430
You just be like...

2997
02:29:46,430 --> 02:29:47,850
All right, let's do the stuff that...

2998
02:29:47,850 --> 02:29:53,130
Doki, to be successful on your date, do the things that Doki...

2999
02:29:53,130 --> 02:29:56,170
Do the things that Doki doesn't do.

3000
02:29:56,290 --> 02:29:58,270
So everything she does now...

3001
02:29:58,270 --> 02:30:01,050
is basically the wrong thing.

3002
02:30:02,930 --> 02:30:03,350
Pop quiz.

3003
02:30:03,810 --> 02:30:04,970
How big are my boobs?

3004
02:30:05,510 --> 02:30:06,690
As if I even have to ask.

3005
02:30:06,710 --> 02:30:07,150
D -size!

3006
02:30:07,550 --> 02:30:09,510
Because I only asked, like, two people.

3007
02:30:10,110 --> 02:30:11,110
Well, I'll be damned.

3008
02:30:11,490 --> 02:30:12,130
You got it.

3009
02:30:12,970 --> 02:30:15,770
Oh, my God.

3010
02:30:16,050 --> 02:30:17,970
I've only asked two people.

3011
02:30:18,130 --> 02:30:19,450
Let's see.

3012
02:30:19,710 --> 02:30:21,350
Longest relationship you've ever had?

3013
02:30:21,350 --> 02:30:22,390
Oh, shit.

3014
02:30:22,530 --> 02:30:24,410
My longest probably a year and some change.

3015
02:30:24,570 --> 02:30:26,970
I'm lucky I can keep it together for two weeks.

3016
02:30:27,390 --> 02:30:28,090
Several years.

3017
02:30:28,230 --> 02:30:28,810
Oh, my gosh.

3018
02:30:28,950 --> 02:30:30,190
Is she looking for something serious?

3019
02:30:30,350 --> 02:30:31,110
I can't tell.

3020
02:30:33,910 --> 02:30:34,430
Whoa.

3021
02:30:35,670 --> 02:30:36,710
Oh, fuck.

3022
02:30:36,950 --> 02:30:39,050
Okay, I remember two things.

3023
02:30:39,550 --> 02:30:40,350
Cup sizes.

3024
02:30:41,510 --> 02:30:44,150
And what they do for a living.

3025
02:30:45,110 --> 02:30:46,230
Probably a year.

3026
02:30:46,370 --> 02:30:47,210
You think a year?

3027
02:30:48,270 --> 02:30:49,370
Oh, thank God.

3028
02:30:49,530 --> 02:30:49,710
Okay.

3029
02:30:53,110 --> 02:30:55,190
I couldn't tell what she wanted from me.

3030
02:30:55,970 --> 02:30:56,850
I legitimately...

3031
02:30:56,850 --> 02:30:58,170
I couldn't tell, guys.

3032
02:30:59,790 --> 02:31:00,230
Like...

3033
02:31:00,230 --> 02:31:01,630
Should I buy her more gifts?

3034
02:31:02,070 --> 02:31:04,870
If I buy her more gifts, does she give me more stuff, chat?

3035
02:31:05,750 --> 02:31:08,430
Guys, does she give me more stuff if I buy her more gifts?

3036
02:31:10,330 --> 02:31:11,470
She doesn't like wine.

3037
02:31:11,510 --> 02:31:12,270
She likes sake.

3038
02:31:13,510 --> 02:31:13,950
Yeah?

3039
02:31:13,950 --> 02:31:14,710
Okay.

3040
02:31:15,010 --> 02:31:16,090
We know what to do.

3041
02:31:16,550 --> 02:31:17,990
I'm gonna get her some drinks.

3042
02:31:18,570 --> 02:31:21,950
And then buy her a puzzle cube.

3043
02:31:24,010 --> 02:31:24,790
Alright.

3044
02:31:25,250 --> 02:31:26,270
What did you give me?

3045
02:31:28,070 --> 02:31:29,730
Consumes all talent tokens.

3046
02:31:29,850 --> 02:31:30,790
Oh, that's good!

3047
02:31:33,970 --> 02:31:34,750
Alright.

3048
02:31:35,850 --> 02:31:36,690
It's time.

3049
02:31:39,730 --> 02:31:40,270
Okay.

3050
02:31:40,270 --> 02:31:42,810
We can do this, chat.

3051
02:31:43,770 --> 02:31:44,450
Remember...

3052
02:31:44,450 --> 02:31:46,270
The moment we get one girl...

3053
02:31:47,290 --> 02:31:47,970
Like...

3054
02:31:47,970 --> 02:31:49,830
We got this, guys.

3055
02:31:50,350 --> 02:31:52,090
We just need one...

3056
02:31:52,090 --> 02:31:53,990
One woman...

3057
02:31:53,990 --> 02:31:55,150
To think we're cool.

3058
02:31:56,450 --> 02:31:57,130
That's...

3059
02:31:57,130 --> 02:31:59,330
We just need...

3060
02:31:59,970 --> 02:32:02,270
That's all we need, like...

3061
02:32:04,430 --> 02:32:07,110
We just need one of them...

3062
02:32:07,110 --> 02:32:08,510
To think we're cool.

3063
02:32:12,410 --> 02:32:13,170
It...

3064
02:32:13,170 --> 02:32:14,290
It...

3065
02:32:14,290 --> 02:32:16,110
It can't be that difficult, right?

3066
02:32:17,770 --> 02:32:19,290
It can't...

3067
02:32:19,290 --> 02:32:21,250
We just need to think we're pretty cool.

3068
02:32:23,150 --> 02:32:23,910
Alright.

3069
02:32:24,050 --> 02:32:24,650
That's good.

3070
02:32:25,390 --> 02:32:26,810
We're not dead!

3071
02:32:27,050 --> 02:32:29,350
This is doable.

3072
02:32:30,210 --> 02:32:31,570
This is so...

3073
02:32:31,570 --> 02:32:34,090
It's so doable, guys.

3074
02:32:34,410 --> 02:32:36,230
Just keep believing!

3075
02:32:40,270 --> 02:32:41,010
Okay.

3076
02:32:44,050 --> 02:32:44,470
Okay.

3077
02:32:44,750 --> 02:32:45,570
That's fine.

3078
02:32:45,670 --> 02:32:46,670
We fixed it.

3079
02:32:47,330 --> 02:32:48,170
That's...

3080
02:32:48,170 --> 02:32:49,730
That's fine.

3081
02:32:50,350 --> 02:32:51,670
We salvaged it.

3082
02:32:52,850 --> 02:32:53,690
We...

3083
02:32:53,870 --> 02:32:54,890
Guys, I...

3084
02:32:54,890 --> 02:32:57,290
I freestyled too hard.

3085
02:32:57,910 --> 02:33:00,230
I freestyled...

3086
02:33:00,230 --> 02:33:01,410
I...

3087
02:33:01,410 --> 02:33:02,970
There's no way...

3088
02:33:02,970 --> 02:33:05,570
Guys, it's okay, like...

3089
02:33:05,570 --> 02:33:07,970
Sometimes I get a little too excited.

3090
02:33:07,970 --> 02:33:08,970
I...

3091
02:33:09,970 --> 02:33:12,450
I just got...

3092
02:33:13,770 --> 02:33:16,110
I got too excited, okay?

3093
02:33:16,670 --> 02:33:17,650
Like, it's...

3094
02:33:17,650 --> 02:33:18,990
I'm working on it.

3095
02:33:19,690 --> 02:33:20,990
I just...

3096
02:33:20,990 --> 02:33:22,310
It was...

3097
02:33:22,310 --> 02:33:23,270
Woah.

3098
02:33:25,910 --> 02:33:27,230
Not bad.

3099
02:33:27,630 --> 02:33:28,070
Woah.

3100
02:33:31,570 --> 02:33:33,810
Same green full left?

3101
02:33:35,150 --> 02:33:36,150
What?

3102
02:33:39,970 --> 02:33:40,610
Oh!

3103
02:33:43,250 --> 02:33:44,790
Okay, we need more sentiment.

3104
02:33:44,990 --> 02:33:46,810
I realized we were not working on sentiment.

3105
02:33:48,710 --> 02:33:50,090
It should be fine.

3106
02:33:52,310 --> 02:33:52,950
Uh...

3107
02:33:52,950 --> 02:33:55,430
And then we get an extra move here, so that's good.

3108
02:33:55,810 --> 02:33:56,350
Alright.

3109
02:33:57,470 --> 02:34:00,510
And then we get more hearts, which is also good.

3110
02:34:02,290 --> 02:34:02,930
Alright.

3111
02:34:05,110 --> 02:34:06,310
Alright, guys.

3112
02:34:06,930 --> 02:34:09,690
Get those broken hearts out of here.

3113
02:34:10,770 --> 02:34:12,070
And then red.

3114
02:34:13,270 --> 02:34:13,830
Okay.

3115
02:34:14,990 --> 02:34:17,070
Do we do red or pink first, guys?

3116
02:34:18,770 --> 02:34:20,550
Hearts, do we do red or heart?

3117
02:34:20,730 --> 02:34:21,350
What do we do?

3118
02:34:22,870 --> 02:34:24,350
Pink, four hearts?

3119
02:34:24,450 --> 02:34:25,010
Where's the four?

3120
02:34:26,530 --> 02:34:27,770
Guys, I can't count.

3121
02:34:29,690 --> 02:34:32,070
Where the fuck do you see four hearts?

3122
02:34:37,160 --> 02:34:37,720
Oh!

3123
02:34:37,720 --> 02:34:39,400
Oh, thank God.

3124
02:34:40,740 --> 02:34:41,560
I'm not...

3125
02:34:41,560 --> 02:34:43,460
I'm not that blind.

3126
02:34:44,080 --> 02:34:44,680
Alright.

3127
02:34:47,540 --> 02:34:48,480
We're okay.

3128
02:34:51,260 --> 02:34:51,820
No!

3129
02:34:53,540 --> 02:34:55,300
We're not okay anymore.

3130
02:34:56,260 --> 02:34:57,640
We have a bell.

3131
02:34:58,660 --> 02:34:59,780
Nice.

3132
02:35:01,840 --> 02:35:03,460
We do this first.

3133
02:35:06,140 --> 02:35:07,320
We'll do this.

3134
02:35:08,040 --> 02:35:09,440
And then we'll do this.

3135
02:35:13,130 --> 02:35:14,770
And then we do this.

3136
02:35:21,260 --> 02:35:22,980
And then we do this.

3137
02:35:23,660 --> 02:35:25,380
And then...

3138
02:35:25,380 --> 02:35:26,100
You know what?

3139
02:35:26,200 --> 02:35:28,980
And then after that, I can do whatever the fuck I want.

3140
02:35:34,340 --> 02:35:36,740
And then after that...

3141
02:35:36,740 --> 02:35:37,720
I can freestyle.

3142
02:35:37,720 --> 02:35:38,140
Freestyle.

3143
02:35:41,220 --> 02:35:42,400
Let's go.

3144
02:35:44,660 --> 02:35:45,340
Easy.

3145
02:35:48,580 --> 02:35:49,940
Fucking easy.

3146
02:35:53,400 --> 02:35:53,740
Really?

3147
02:35:55,340 --> 02:35:56,080
Look at that.

3148
02:35:56,280 --> 02:35:57,140
Didn't fumble.

3149
02:35:57,300 --> 02:35:59,280
I'm actually getting better at rizzing.

3150
02:36:00,120 --> 02:36:02,400
This is actually like a character art, guys.

3151
02:36:02,580 --> 02:36:04,000
I'm improving.

3152
02:36:04,000 --> 02:36:05,220
Whoa.

3153
02:36:06,720 --> 02:36:08,260
I love swimming.

3154
02:36:09,960 --> 02:36:11,220
Oh, I got a new message.

3155
02:36:11,360 --> 02:36:12,120
You're so close.

3156
02:36:12,540 --> 02:36:20,320
Once your relationship with a girl is at four or more hearts, there's a chance you can pull her home after the next date?

3157
02:36:21,720 --> 02:36:24,640
Take her out at night, though?

3158
02:36:27,140 --> 02:36:27,780
That's...

3159
02:36:27,780 --> 02:36:29,520
the only way.

3160
02:36:29,800 --> 02:36:31,520
But we haven't...

3161
02:36:31,520 --> 02:36:32,880
Wait, but...

3162
02:36:32,880 --> 02:36:35,120
Do you think she's gonna hold hands with me?

3163
02:36:36,200 --> 02:36:36,600
Guys?

3164
02:36:37,640 --> 02:36:39,300
Am I...

3165
02:36:39,300 --> 02:36:42,160
Am I gonna hold hands with her?

3166
02:36:47,340 --> 02:36:48,240
What?

3167
02:36:49,400 --> 02:36:49,980
What?

3168
02:36:51,860 --> 02:36:53,340
Oh shit.

3169
02:37:01,780 --> 02:37:03,670
I only have...

3170
02:37:04,560 --> 02:37:05,340
Guys.

3171
02:37:06,240 --> 02:37:07,860
Guys, we can't...

3172
02:37:07,860 --> 02:37:10,300
We can't be honest right now.

3173
02:37:11,000 --> 02:37:11,640
Guys.

3174
02:37:14,400 --> 02:37:15,860
Oh shit.

3175
02:37:16,860 --> 02:37:17,800
Guys.

3176
02:37:18,300 --> 02:37:19,360
I don't know.

3177
02:37:19,480 --> 02:37:21,220
She wants me to be honest.

3178
02:37:24,500 --> 02:37:26,620
Oh, thank God.

3179
02:37:27,900 --> 02:37:29,020
Oh, thank God.

3180
02:37:29,020 --> 02:37:30,200
Oh, thank God.

3181
02:37:30,560 --> 02:37:31,700
We're okay.

3182
02:37:34,200 --> 02:37:35,500
Oh, thank God.

3183
02:37:35,600 --> 02:37:36,520
Okay, we're fine.

3184
02:37:36,940 --> 02:37:37,560
We're fine.

3185
02:37:37,840 --> 02:37:39,240
Everything is fine.

3186
02:37:39,460 --> 02:37:40,180
We're fine.

3187
02:37:40,400 --> 02:37:43,080
Everything is fine.

3188
02:37:44,180 --> 02:37:45,700
I don't know.

3189
02:37:46,120 --> 02:37:51,340
My entire personality in this date right now is manufactured so I can see...

3190
02:37:51,340 --> 02:37:52,760
so we can hold hands.

3191
02:37:52,760 --> 02:37:53,700
So...

3192
02:37:57,240 --> 02:37:57,920
Like...

3193
02:37:57,920 --> 02:38:02,440
My entire personality is manufactured right now because I want to hold her hand.

3194
02:38:03,680 --> 02:38:04,360
Like...

3195
02:38:04,360 --> 02:38:07,020
Pre-marital eye contact incoming.

3196
02:38:08,240 --> 02:38:09,460
Thank you for the super chat.

3197
02:38:09,540 --> 02:38:09,800
Thank you.

3198
02:38:09,860 --> 02:38:10,580
Thank you.

3199
02:38:13,660 --> 02:38:14,340
Okay.

3200
02:38:15,320 --> 02:38:16,000
Um...

3201
02:38:16,000 --> 02:38:17,720
What do we want, guys?

3202
02:38:18,780 --> 02:38:20,720
What's the best upgrade next?

3203
02:38:22,760 --> 02:38:23,660
See what luck?

3204
02:38:24,120 --> 02:38:26,540
I don't have enough for that.

3205
02:38:29,600 --> 02:38:31,620
I don't know what to get.

3206
02:38:36,680 --> 02:38:37,260
Passion?

3207
02:38:37,460 --> 02:38:38,320
Red or green?

3208
02:38:40,520 --> 02:38:41,820
Red or green?

3209
02:38:42,040 --> 02:38:42,620
Flirtation?

3210
02:38:44,400 --> 02:38:46,700
Do we have flirtation or sexuality?

3211
02:38:47,460 --> 02:38:48,500
Oh, flirt for Tiffany?

3212
02:38:48,660 --> 02:38:49,220
Who's Tiffany?

3213
02:38:49,600 --> 02:38:50,720
Oh, sorry.

3214
02:38:52,060 --> 02:38:53,300
Guys, I told you.

3215
02:38:53,300 --> 02:38:54,300
There's too many girls.

3216
02:38:54,480 --> 02:38:55,600
I already forgot their names.

3217
02:38:55,680 --> 02:38:57,320
I just know what they look like now.

3218
02:38:57,580 --> 02:39:05,060
I'm at a point where my brain has deleted what their names are and just know what they look like.

3219
02:39:05,700 --> 02:39:08,640
There's too many to keep track of, chat.

3220
02:39:09,080 --> 02:39:10,880
That was me.

3221
02:39:10,980 --> 02:39:12,520
There's too many to keep track.

3222
02:39:13,060 --> 02:39:15,140
I can't do a fifth woman.

3223
02:39:19,460 --> 02:39:19,980
Alright.

3224
02:39:19,980 --> 02:39:22,360
We gotta talk to her at...

3225
02:39:23,780 --> 02:39:26,920
We gotta talk to her at night.

3226
02:39:32,390 --> 02:39:32,870
Anton!

3227
02:39:33,210 --> 02:39:33,370
Thank you.

3228
02:39:33,750 --> 02:39:38,430
If you give her the right gift, you get enough points to afford a 2800?

3229
02:39:39,210 --> 02:39:40,570
Oh, I got a message from Aiko.

3230
02:39:41,230 --> 02:39:41,730
Hey, handsome.

3231
02:39:42,270 --> 02:39:44,690
I really enjoyed our...

3232
02:39:47,810 --> 02:39:48,290
Okay.

3233
02:39:48,970 --> 02:39:50,970
Let's figure out...

3234
02:39:50,970 --> 02:39:53,630
Let's decide... Let's play a game, chat.

3235
02:39:55,130 --> 02:39:57,610
Guys, let's play a game.

3236
02:39:58,430 --> 02:40:00,070
Where do we need a sensor?

3237
02:40:02,810 --> 02:40:04,970
I think it's...

3238
02:40:06,410 --> 02:40:08,030
Get the sensor image!

3239
02:40:08,150 --> 02:40:08,610
Okay.

3240
02:40:08,910 --> 02:40:09,450
Okay.

3241
02:40:10,570 --> 02:40:12,730
We're not gonna play that game.

3242
02:40:13,230 --> 02:40:14,830
We're not...

3243
02:40:18,250 --> 02:40:24,590
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH Right here.

3244
02:40:26,590 --> 02:40:27,990
Okay.

3245
02:40:29,030 --> 02:40:30,430
Okay.

3246
02:40:31,110 --> 02:40:32,510
So...

3247
02:40:32,510 --> 02:40:33,670
Whoa.

3248
02:40:34,310 --> 02:40:35,010
Okay.

3249
02:40:37,110 --> 02:40:38,510
So...

3250
02:40:38,510 --> 02:40:40,690
You can sort of...

3251
02:40:40,690 --> 02:40:41,450
What?

3252
02:40:44,150 --> 02:40:44,970
Okay.

3253
02:40:44,970 --> 02:40:45,650
Okay.

3254
02:40:53,530 --> 02:40:54,650
Alright.

3255
02:40:56,730 --> 02:40:59,930
This is beyond hand-holding, chat.

3256
02:41:01,570 --> 02:41:02,330
Guys.

3257
02:41:02,930 --> 02:41:03,790
This...

3258
02:41:03,790 --> 02:41:06,330
This is beyond hand-holding.

3259
02:41:06,690 --> 02:41:07,090
Guys.

3260
02:41:08,610 --> 02:41:09,730
I...

3261
02:41:09,730 --> 02:41:10,950
Guys.

3262
02:41:11,610 --> 02:41:14,130
This is not hand-holding, guys.

3263
02:41:14,130 --> 02:41:14,890
This is...

3264
02:41:14,890 --> 02:41:16,630
This is...

3265
02:41:17,840 --> 02:41:19,290
This is not...

3266
02:41:19,290 --> 02:41:20,010
This is...

3267
02:41:20,010 --> 02:41:20,530
Guys!

3268
02:41:21,090 --> 02:41:23,150
I thought we were gonna...

3269
02:41:23,150 --> 02:41:27,770
I thought we were gonna hold hands.

3270
02:41:28,770 --> 02:41:29,570
I know.

3271
02:41:32,830 --> 02:41:34,470
I know.

3272
02:41:34,470 --> 02:41:34,470
Well,

3273
02:41:38,770 --> 02:41:39,550
we're at the beach.

3274
02:41:40,400 --> 02:41:40,810
Oh.

3275
02:41:42,230 --> 02:41:44,130
Sorry, I don't know.

3276
02:41:44,130 --> 02:41:45,450
I thought this...

3277
02:41:45,450 --> 02:41:47,710
We're literally on the beach, though, Tiffany.

3278
02:41:51,830 --> 02:41:54,010
Tiffany, we're at the beach.

3279
02:41:54,130 --> 02:41:57,930
I thought you wanted me to answer the beach answer.

3280
02:42:00,770 --> 02:42:02,790
We're at the beach.

3281
02:42:07,190 --> 02:42:08,110
We'll see.

3282
02:42:08,270 --> 02:42:09,310
Thank you for the super chat.

3283
02:42:09,390 --> 02:42:10,470
Thank you, thank you.

3284
02:42:11,450 --> 02:42:13,210
Doki's laugh made that one more.

3285
02:42:13,790 --> 02:42:15,070
Thank you for the super chat.

3286
02:42:15,150 --> 02:42:16,270
Thank you, thank you.

3287
02:42:20,770 --> 02:42:22,190
Tati, thank you for the super chat.

3288
02:42:22,310 --> 02:42:22,910
Thank you, thank you.

3289
02:42:22,970 --> 02:42:24,630
I left the room for like two minutes.

3290
02:42:24,730 --> 02:42:25,210
What happened?

3291
02:42:25,270 --> 02:42:25,970
Nothing happened.

3292
02:42:26,490 --> 02:42:27,170
Nothing happened.

3293
02:42:27,470 --> 02:42:29,030
No, you didn't miss out on anything.

3294
02:42:30,390 --> 02:42:31,190
Nothing happened.

3295
02:42:32,810 --> 02:42:33,210
Disrespectful.

3296
02:42:33,270 --> 02:42:34,090
Thank you for the super chat.

3297
02:42:34,170 --> 02:42:35,050
Thank you, thank you.

3298
02:42:35,350 --> 02:42:37,650
My earphone jack disconnected in my bank...

3299
02:42:37,650 --> 02:42:38,470
In my bank.

3300
02:42:39,370 --> 02:42:43,570
...at work, and you screamed so loud at the right time...

3301
02:42:43,570 --> 02:42:46,170
...that everyone is looking at me.

3302
02:42:46,590 --> 02:42:48,990
We just held hands, you know?

3303
02:42:49,350 --> 02:42:53,630
We just held hands.

3304
02:42:54,750 --> 02:42:55,670
That's...

3305
02:42:55,670 --> 02:42:56,130
Yeah.

3306
02:42:57,130 --> 02:42:58,050
Yeah.

3307
02:42:58,630 --> 02:42:59,850
Hand-holding.

3308
02:43:04,470 --> 02:43:05,390
Okay.

3309
02:43:05,830 --> 02:43:07,170
Okay, $3.50.

3310
02:43:07,170 --> 02:43:09,480
Alright, you like to...

3311
02:43:10,630 --> 02:43:13,570
Oh my god, I've lost track of what people like.

3312
02:43:14,810 --> 02:43:17,710
Guys, I've lost track of what they all like.

3313
02:43:17,890 --> 02:43:20,910
Guys, I can't tell no more.

3314
02:43:23,070 --> 02:43:23,690
Green!

3315
02:43:24,150 --> 02:43:25,210
Okay, green.

3316
02:43:26,910 --> 02:43:31,650
I'm serious when I say I don't know anymore what they like.

3317
02:43:31,930 --> 02:43:36,270
I don't know anymore.

3318
02:43:36,270 --> 02:43:38,190
Okay, but now I know they like green.

3319
02:43:38,610 --> 02:43:41,270
There's just so many of them that...

3320
02:43:41,270 --> 02:43:42,510
I just...

3321
02:43:42,510 --> 02:43:44,350
I can't tell anymore.

3322
02:43:44,450 --> 02:43:45,330
There's too many.

3323
02:43:46,070 --> 02:43:48,910
There's just way too many to keep track.

3324
02:43:51,870 --> 02:43:57,450
Yeah, I don't have any pink at the moment, so I'm just gonna...

3325
02:43:57,450 --> 02:43:59,430
I'm just freestyling again.

3326
02:44:00,170 --> 02:44:02,070
It's our favorite thing to do, chat.

3327
02:44:02,970 --> 02:44:05,610
It's our favorite thing to do.

3328
02:44:06,270 --> 02:44:07,450
Oh my god!

3329
02:44:08,570 --> 02:44:09,710
We're so fucked.

3330
02:44:09,850 --> 02:44:10,610
We need $3.50.

3331
02:44:11,310 --> 02:44:15,770
We need $3.50, guys.

3332
02:44:16,750 --> 02:44:18,290
Alright, there we go.

3333
02:44:19,790 --> 02:44:21,610
What do we do here?

3334
02:44:24,190 --> 02:44:25,270
It's so over?

3335
02:44:25,390 --> 02:44:26,190
No, it's fine.

3336
02:44:26,310 --> 02:44:27,050
Don't say that.

3337
02:44:27,710 --> 02:44:29,490
It's never over, guys.

3338
02:44:30,370 --> 02:44:30,990
It's...

3339
02:44:30,990 --> 02:44:32,450
Guys, don't say that.

3340
02:44:32,510 --> 02:44:34,210
Guys, it's never over.

3341
02:44:35,050 --> 02:44:39,470
Guys, guys, guys, guys.

3342
02:44:39,470 --> 02:44:41,370
It's never over, guys.

3343
02:44:41,670 --> 02:44:42,970
Don't be silly.

3344
02:44:45,190 --> 02:44:47,190
Don't be silly, guys.

3345
02:44:49,010 --> 02:44:50,310
It's not over.

3346
02:44:50,550 --> 02:44:51,950
There's still hope.

3347
02:44:54,990 --> 02:44:56,430
I can set up five red?

3348
02:44:58,410 --> 02:45:00,190
I can do that?

3349
02:45:03,940 --> 02:45:06,960
Red bottom, the top four red?

3350
02:45:08,750 --> 02:45:10,000
That's not four.

3351
02:45:11,640 --> 02:45:13,200
That's three.

3352
02:45:16,470 --> 02:45:17,320
That's not...

3353
02:45:18,350 --> 02:45:20,430
Match blue in the bottom middle?

3354
02:45:22,030 --> 02:45:23,090
Music notes?

3355
02:45:23,850 --> 02:45:24,270
Here?

3356
02:45:32,020 --> 02:45:33,040
Here?

3357
02:45:35,140 --> 02:45:36,200
No.

3358
02:45:36,460 --> 02:45:36,840
Okay.

3359
02:45:39,480 --> 02:45:41,080
There's a right blue?

3360
02:45:43,520 --> 02:45:44,480
Here.

3361
02:45:46,580 --> 02:45:47,940
This one.

3362
02:45:48,440 --> 02:45:50,820
I need everybody to know if I'm...

3363
02:45:51,440 --> 02:45:52,380
This one?

3364
02:45:54,460 --> 02:45:55,420
Yes.

3365
02:45:55,900 --> 02:45:56,540
Alright.

3366
02:45:57,240 --> 02:45:58,100
Oh shit!

3367
02:45:59,480 --> 02:46:01,680
Oh shit, we're so smart.

3368
02:46:02,140 --> 02:46:03,100
I'm so smart.

3369
02:46:05,080 --> 02:46:06,040
Alright.

3370
02:46:14,820 --> 02:46:16,300
Alright, now I'm lost.

3371
02:46:16,840 --> 02:46:18,000
We're not back.

3372
02:46:18,100 --> 02:46:19,700
We have 350, guys.

3373
02:46:19,840 --> 02:46:23,240
We're like so far from back, guys.

3374
02:46:25,220 --> 02:46:29,260
Guys, we're so far from back.

3375
02:46:30,840 --> 02:46:35,940
I don't know where you think the back part's at, but we're not there.

3376
02:46:37,840 --> 02:46:40,960
We are most definitely not there.

3377
02:46:45,380 --> 02:46:45,840
Okay.

3378
02:46:47,360 --> 02:46:49,440
We can maybe...

3379
02:46:49,440 --> 02:46:50,800
Consume all talents.

3380
02:46:50,840 --> 02:46:54,500
Okay, if we get five, we might be able to do this and then be back again.

3381
02:46:55,620 --> 02:46:56,640
We're gonna do that.

3382
02:46:57,560 --> 02:46:59,780
And then we're gonna get enough talents here.

3383
02:47:01,380 --> 02:47:02,300
And then...

3384
02:47:02,300 --> 02:47:05,760
If I do this and I consume all the green, will it work?

3385
02:47:06,360 --> 02:47:08,340
Will we get all the bonus points for green?

3386
02:47:08,660 --> 02:47:11,340
Guys, there's 11 moves and we're at 94.

3387
02:47:14,040 --> 02:47:15,500
Okay, I'm gonna consume this.

3388
02:47:16,640 --> 02:47:19,040
Guys, if I do this...

3389
02:47:19,940 --> 02:47:21,160
Oh, talent is blue?

3390
02:47:21,740 --> 02:47:22,960
Your talent is blue?

3391
02:47:23,160 --> 02:47:24,500
I thought it was green!

3392
02:47:32,840 --> 02:47:34,420
Oh, this consumes blue!

3393
02:47:35,700 --> 02:47:37,960
Oh my God, I'm so fucking stupid.

3394
02:47:37,960 --> 02:47:39,080
Oh my...

3395
02:47:42,640 --> 02:47:46,500
I didn't realize it meant it consumes this color.

3396
02:47:47,080 --> 02:47:48,820
I'm so stupid.

3397
02:47:49,460 --> 02:47:50,080
Okay, okay.

3398
02:47:51,280 --> 02:47:53,440
Okay, we still got this.

3399
02:47:54,100 --> 02:47:56,360
We still got this.

3400
02:47:56,960 --> 02:47:58,160
I was thinking...

3401
02:47:58,840 --> 02:48:01,120
I don't know what I was thinking.

3402
02:48:01,580 --> 02:48:02,800
I know, I know.

3403
02:48:03,140 --> 02:48:05,340
Alright, we're still gonna use it though.

3404
02:48:06,340 --> 02:48:07,400
Alright.

3405
02:48:08,160 --> 02:48:08,840
Nice.

3406
02:48:11,220 --> 02:48:12,960
Then we get an extra here.

3407
02:48:13,620 --> 02:48:15,440
And then we can get red here.

3408
02:48:16,940 --> 02:48:18,080
Yes.

3409
02:48:18,800 --> 02:48:19,340
Alright.

3410
02:48:20,820 --> 02:48:21,680
350.

3411
02:48:23,240 --> 02:48:24,020
Okay.

3412
02:48:28,080 --> 02:48:28,740
Alright.

3413
02:48:30,180 --> 02:48:31,500
Okay.

3414
02:48:32,660 --> 02:48:34,460
Now, this is...

3415
02:48:34,460 --> 02:48:36,240
This is very risky.

3416
02:48:36,600 --> 02:48:37,460
We can get...

3417
02:48:38,380 --> 02:48:40,360
One more and do another talent.

3418
02:48:42,720 --> 02:48:43,440
Yeah.

3419
02:48:44,440 --> 02:48:46,340
And then consume a selected...

3420
02:48:46,340 --> 02:48:48,440
Alright, should we do vintage platform?

3421
02:48:49,100 --> 02:48:50,380
Or hairbrush?

3422
02:48:51,200 --> 02:48:52,600
Guys, which one?

3423
02:48:57,300 --> 02:48:58,120
Left heart?

3424
02:48:58,200 --> 02:48:59,240
We should do left heart?

3425
02:49:01,660 --> 02:49:02,880
Left bell?

3426
02:49:02,880 --> 02:49:03,260
Left bell?

3427
02:49:05,640 --> 02:49:07,040
Guys, I...

3428
02:49:07,040 --> 02:49:08,520
Where are you seeing this bell?

3429
02:49:10,920 --> 02:49:13,680
Move the bell to the left side?

3430
02:49:14,380 --> 02:49:16,800
Guys, where the fuck are you seeing this bell?

3431
02:49:20,210 --> 02:49:21,910
Bell left corner?

3432
02:49:22,670 --> 02:49:25,030
The fuck you want me to move this to?

3433
02:49:26,750 --> 02:49:29,450
Like, there's nowhere to move this.

3434
02:49:30,970 --> 02:49:32,830
Bottom left to up?

3435
02:49:35,250 --> 02:49:36,630
Are you blind?

3436
02:49:36,890 --> 02:49:37,910
Am I blind?

3437
02:49:42,050 --> 02:49:45,810
There are two directions.

3438
02:49:47,450 --> 02:49:48,630
Yes.

3439
02:49:49,770 --> 02:49:50,930
Oh shit.

3440
02:49:53,980 --> 02:49:55,650
We figured it out.

3441
02:49:57,100 --> 02:49:59,130
We did it, everybody.

3442
02:49:59,950 --> 02:50:03,470
We fucking did it.

3443
02:50:04,650 --> 02:50:05,230
Okay.

3444
02:50:08,020 --> 02:50:08,310
Alright.

3445
02:50:09,550 --> 02:50:11,390
Oh, we can get four here.

3446
02:50:12,070 --> 02:50:12,870
Is this worth it?

3447
02:50:14,050 --> 02:50:16,330
Four reds, this could be worth it, right?

3448
02:50:16,890 --> 02:50:18,350
This should be worth it.

3449
02:50:19,790 --> 02:50:22,090
Okay, we have a hundred.

3450
02:50:27,090 --> 02:50:30,170
Okay, do we do platform shoes or hairbrush, guys?

3451
02:50:31,110 --> 02:50:31,690
Brush?

3452
02:50:32,190 --> 02:50:33,750
But where do we do it at?

3453
02:50:34,610 --> 02:50:37,050
Guys, where do we do it at?

3454
02:50:45,670 --> 02:50:47,310
I say brush?

3455
02:50:48,110 --> 02:50:48,830
Brush your shoes.

3456
02:50:49,310 --> 02:50:50,470
Brush your shoes.

3457
02:50:51,290 --> 02:50:52,130
Brush?

3458
02:50:52,350 --> 02:50:53,070
I'm doing it.

3459
02:50:53,130 --> 02:50:54,930
Alright, what row?

3460
02:50:55,410 --> 02:50:56,730
Guys, this is it.

3461
02:50:56,830 --> 02:50:58,750
We have five turns.

3462
02:51:01,490 --> 02:51:03,550
Do something with Tiffany.

3463
02:51:04,190 --> 02:51:07,830
I did not mean the word like that.

3464
02:51:07,890 --> 02:51:12,790
But we have two moves to figure this out together.

3465
02:51:13,490 --> 02:51:14,750
This or this?

3466
02:51:15,370 --> 02:51:16,290
Which second row?

3467
02:51:16,490 --> 02:51:17,550
Which way are you counting?

3468
02:51:17,850 --> 02:51:19,550
One, two or one, two?

3469
02:51:19,910 --> 02:51:20,230
Yeah?

3470
02:51:27,570 --> 02:51:28,170
Here.

3471
02:51:29,290 --> 02:51:30,330
Right here.

3472
02:51:31,210 --> 02:51:32,250
Your final answer.

3473
02:51:34,110 --> 02:51:35,570
Right here.

3474
02:51:35,730 --> 02:51:36,750
I'm gonna do it.

3475
02:51:36,790 --> 02:51:38,210
It's gonna get done.

3476
02:51:40,430 --> 02:51:41,430
Alright.

3477
02:51:43,090 --> 02:51:44,090
Yes.

3478
02:51:45,790 --> 02:51:48,130
Alright, alright, alright, alright.

3479
02:51:50,330 --> 02:51:50,830
Okay.

3480
02:51:52,270 --> 02:51:53,590
We put green here.

3481
02:51:57,330 --> 02:51:58,330
Or...

3482
02:52:00,050 --> 02:52:01,050
Alright.

3483
02:52:01,870 --> 02:52:02,310
Alright.

3484
02:52:02,610 --> 02:52:05,090
We can get another three and get platform shoes.

3485
02:52:05,170 --> 02:52:05,710
Do we do it?

3486
02:52:06,390 --> 02:52:07,850
Is it worth it, guys?

3487
02:52:08,450 --> 02:52:12,950
If we do three and get platform shoes...

3488
02:52:20,360 --> 02:52:21,540
Is it worth it?

3489
02:52:23,240 --> 02:52:23,680
Alright.

3490
02:52:25,780 --> 02:52:26,220
Alright.

3491
02:52:28,980 --> 02:52:29,420
No?

3492
02:52:30,200 --> 02:52:31,340
Green star at the top?

3493
02:52:31,420 --> 02:52:32,960
Okay, we'll get the green star first.

3494
02:52:33,520 --> 02:52:34,780
We'll do this first, actually.

3495
02:52:38,460 --> 02:52:39,320
Oh my God.

3496
02:52:39,780 --> 02:52:41,320
Oh my God, guys, wait.

3497
02:52:41,940 --> 02:52:43,020
Wait, this is possible.

3498
02:52:43,860 --> 02:52:44,340
Wait.

3499
02:52:45,120 --> 02:52:46,020
Wait a minute.

3500
02:52:47,260 --> 02:52:48,140
Wait a minute.

3501
02:52:49,880 --> 02:52:50,720
Wait a minute.

3502
02:52:51,800 --> 02:52:52,460
Oh, fuck.

3503
02:52:52,520 --> 02:52:52,800
Okay.

3504
02:52:53,600 --> 02:52:54,020
Okay.

3505
02:52:54,900 --> 02:52:56,060
Is it worth it?

3506
02:52:58,180 --> 02:52:59,200
Do we do it?

3507
02:52:59,740 --> 02:53:01,860
Do we get... Do we get the shoes?

3508
02:53:02,280 --> 02:53:04,300
If we get the shoes, we have three turns.

3509
02:53:10,880 --> 02:53:11,440
Alright.

3510
02:53:12,720 --> 02:53:14,300
We're not choosing hearts!

3511
02:53:14,460 --> 02:53:15,260
There's no...

3512
02:53:15,260 --> 02:53:15,720
Okay.

3513
02:53:19,470 --> 02:53:20,710
Alright, here we go.

3514
02:53:21,370 --> 02:53:23,530
Alright, three turns and a drink.

3515
02:53:23,610 --> 02:53:24,070
Which color?

3516
02:53:24,230 --> 02:53:24,910
What do we do?

3517
02:53:25,550 --> 02:53:26,110
Red?

3518
02:53:26,930 --> 02:53:27,910
Oh God, okay.

3519
02:53:29,290 --> 02:53:30,330
Okay, we go up.

3520
02:53:30,830 --> 02:53:31,330
Which way?

3521
02:53:33,070 --> 02:53:33,630
Orange?

3522
02:53:34,790 --> 02:53:36,210
And we move here.

3523
02:53:37,350 --> 02:53:38,950
There's only one thing we can do in orange.

3524
02:53:38,950 --> 02:53:39,430
Orange?

3525
02:53:40,570 --> 02:53:41,250
Orange?

3526
02:53:41,530 --> 02:53:41,850
Here?

3527
02:53:48,340 --> 02:53:49,800
But we move here.

3528
02:54:01,050 --> 02:54:02,870
Okay, I'm clicking it.

3529
02:54:03,810 --> 02:54:05,030
I'm gonna click it.

3530
02:54:05,930 --> 02:54:07,290
And I move this.

3531
02:54:08,330 --> 02:54:09,950
Which we move first, actually.

3532
02:54:11,190 --> 02:54:12,850
Is that the only thing we can move?

3533
02:54:13,310 --> 02:54:13,890
Which one?

3534
02:54:14,030 --> 02:54:15,870
This one or this one?

3535
02:54:22,460 --> 02:54:23,680
This one.

3536
02:54:25,000 --> 02:54:26,060
This one?

3537
02:54:26,160 --> 02:54:27,240
Which one?

3538
02:54:27,340 --> 02:54:29,860
There's so many oranges, I'm freaking out!

3539
02:54:31,420 --> 02:54:32,400
This one.

3540
02:54:35,300 --> 02:54:36,120
And then this.

3541
02:54:39,800 --> 02:54:40,480
Yeah?

3542
02:54:40,920 --> 02:54:41,880
I'm gonna do it!

3543
02:54:42,580 --> 02:54:43,980
I'm gonna fucking do it!

3544
02:54:46,040 --> 02:54:49,440
Oh my God, this three moves bullshit is gonna fucking kill me.

3545
02:54:49,820 --> 02:54:52,540
I'm gonna go fucking crazy.

3546
02:54:52,540 --> 02:54:53,640
I'm...

3547
02:54:54,820 --> 02:54:57,360
I'm gonna go crazy.

3548
02:55:03,260 --> 02:55:04,440
I'm gonna...

3549
02:55:04,440 --> 02:55:06,800
I'm gonna go crazy.

3550
02:55:07,580 --> 02:55:08,540
I'm gonna...

3551
02:55:13,740 --> 02:55:15,340
Oh wait, orange again.

3552
02:55:15,820 --> 02:55:16,840
Wait, I can do another orange.

3553
02:55:22,400 --> 02:55:23,620
Wait, which one?

3554
02:55:23,800 --> 02:55:24,060
Okay.

3555
02:55:25,060 --> 02:55:25,660
No?

3556
02:55:26,160 --> 02:55:27,200
Why no?

3557
02:55:32,440 --> 02:55:33,240
Yeah?

3558
02:55:35,340 --> 02:55:36,300
Okay.

3559
02:55:40,260 --> 02:55:41,940
And another one.

3560
02:55:50,090 --> 02:55:51,810
And another one.

3561
02:55:52,690 --> 02:55:57,620
And another one.

3562
02:56:01,100 --> 02:56:04,600
Yeah, but I have... Don't I have the unlimited moves right now?

3563
02:56:07,220 --> 02:56:09,280
I have unlimited moves though!

3564
02:56:16,500 --> 02:56:17,560
Wait, no!

3565
02:56:17,920 --> 02:56:19,940
What happened to my unlimited orange moves?

3566
02:56:30,010 --> 02:56:30,670
Okay.

3567
02:56:31,810 --> 02:56:32,350
Orange

3568
02:56:37,660 --> 02:56:38,080
moves!

3569
02:57:04,900 --> 02:57:06,980
Oh my God, we did it!

3570
02:57:07,540 --> 02:57:08,640
Oh, we did it!

3571
02:57:12,070 --> 02:57:14,140
My God, I'm the coolest guy she knows.

3572
02:57:18,810 --> 02:57:20,470
We're ratatouille-ing this.

3573
02:57:20,590 --> 02:57:21,610
I'm bringing you guys along.

3574
02:57:27,530 --> 02:57:31,210
We're ratatouille-ing you along on this date.

3575
02:57:33,710 --> 02:57:35,130
Oh my God.

3576
02:57:35,510 --> 02:57:36,190
Oh shit.

3577
02:57:36,870 --> 02:57:38,150
How much do you weigh?

3578
02:57:41,470 --> 02:57:42,550
Oh shit.

3579
02:57:43,010 --> 02:57:43,330
Nice.

3580
02:57:43,410 --> 02:57:44,110
Good for you.

3581
02:57:45,010 --> 02:57:46,050
Good for you.

3582
02:57:48,610 --> 02:57:49,150
Um...

3583
02:57:49,800 --> 02:57:51,830
Can I bring some people to our date?

3584
02:57:52,410 --> 02:57:54,870
Like, don't freak out, okay?

3585
02:57:54,890 --> 02:57:56,950
If you hear things underneath my hat...

3586
02:57:56,950 --> 02:57:58,730
Don't freak out, you're just crazy.

3587
02:57:59,690 --> 02:58:00,930
How tall are you?

3588
02:58:04,370 --> 02:58:04,910
Alright.

3589
02:58:06,130 --> 02:58:06,910
We learned her.

3590
02:58:07,230 --> 02:58:08,370
It's still the afternoon.

3591
02:58:08,610 --> 02:58:10,430
Okay, and then she's tired of talking to me.

3592
02:58:10,750 --> 02:58:11,610
Alright, Jessie!

3593
02:58:11,610 --> 02:58:11,830
Jessie!

3594
02:58:13,310 --> 02:58:16,450
Hello, Jessie.

3595
02:58:17,310 --> 02:58:18,650
Is it nighttime yet?

3596
02:58:18,790 --> 02:58:19,770
Oh, it's still evening.

3597
02:58:20,110 --> 02:58:20,670
Goddammit.

3598
02:58:21,110 --> 02:58:22,510
Oh, she's doing fitness.

3599
02:58:24,170 --> 02:58:24,270
Hey!

3600
02:58:27,390 --> 02:58:28,690
Oh, me?

3601
02:58:30,010 --> 02:58:31,830
Thanks, it does feel a little warm here.

3602
02:58:36,400 --> 02:58:36,960
Alright.

3603
02:58:37,320 --> 02:58:37,980
What does she want?

3604
02:58:38,600 --> 02:58:39,160
Martini.

3605
02:58:39,480 --> 02:58:41,460
Maybe she'll want a drink while she's working out.

3606
02:58:42,000 --> 02:58:43,200
There's nothing wrong with that.

3607
02:58:43,860 --> 02:58:45,380
Like, you do you, girl.

3608
02:58:49,900 --> 02:58:50,720
Alright, nice.

3609
02:58:50,940 --> 02:58:52,580
Alright, time to talk.

3610
02:58:57,340 --> 02:58:58,380
Doesn't she smoke?

3611
02:58:58,600 --> 02:58:59,980
I think you're kinda sexy.

3612
02:59:01,540 --> 02:59:02,220
Oh, yeah?

3613
02:59:02,360 --> 02:59:02,940
You smoke?

3614
02:59:03,160 --> 02:59:03,900
Oh, me too.

3615
02:59:04,000 --> 02:59:04,900
I can totally smoke.

3616
02:59:07,960 --> 02:59:09,900
Not my first time.

3617
02:59:13,540 --> 02:59:16,920
Hey, I took this for you, ya pervert!

3618
02:59:17,440 --> 02:59:18,920
Hope it came out alright.

3619
02:59:19,200 --> 02:59:20,120
It was...

3620
02:59:21,400 --> 02:59:22,040
Okay.

3621
02:59:22,660 --> 02:59:24,400
Guys, I'm a little nervous, guys.

3622
02:59:25,780 --> 02:59:28,320
I hope nothing shows at the fucking corners.

3623
02:59:41,920 --> 02:59:42,560
Okay.

3624
02:59:43,640 --> 02:59:46,000
I don't even know how to censor this.

3625
02:59:46,540 --> 02:59:47,020
I...

3626
02:59:47,020 --> 02:59:50,940
I don't even...

3627
02:59:50,940 --> 02:59:52,860
I don't even...

3628
02:59:55,800 --> 02:59:56,540
God.

3629
02:59:56,540 --> 02:59:59,120
Holy shit.

3630
03:00:01,000 --> 03:00:03,060
Oh my God.

3631
03:00:04,420 --> 03:00:05,820
Guys, I...

3632
03:00:05,820 --> 03:00:07,960
I don't know how to...

3633
03:00:07,960 --> 03:00:10,320
I don't...

3634
03:00:10,320 --> 03:00:14,420
I don't know how to censor this, guys.

3635
03:00:15,640 --> 03:00:17,780
Guys, this is a problem.

3636
03:00:17,960 --> 03:00:19,620
I need to use two censors.

3637
03:00:19,780 --> 03:00:21,120
This is such a problem.

3638
03:00:21,120 --> 03:00:21,400
This is...

3639
03:00:23,260 --> 03:00:26,060
This is a huge problem.

3640
03:00:29,000 --> 03:00:31,420
Oh my God, I don't even know if I'm safe.

3641
03:00:31,900 --> 03:00:33,320
I don't even...

3642
03:00:33,320 --> 03:00:34,440
I don't even...

3643
03:00:34,440 --> 03:00:35,560
Oh God, okay.

3644
03:00:36,120 --> 03:00:36,540
Alright.

3645
03:00:36,900 --> 03:00:38,420
This is gonna...

3646
03:00:38,420 --> 03:00:40,360
This is actually gonna be really bad.

3647
03:00:41,600 --> 03:00:42,560
Oh, God.

3648
03:00:42,680 --> 03:00:43,280
This is not...

3649
03:00:47,580 --> 03:00:48,860
This is...

3650
03:00:48,860 --> 03:00:50,080
Okay, great.

3651
03:00:51,660 --> 03:00:52,460
You...

3652
03:00:58,300 --> 03:01:04,420
You can sort of tell where this is...

3653
03:01:04,420 --> 03:01:05,120
Where...

3654
03:01:05,120 --> 03:01:05,660
What...

3655
03:01:05,660 --> 03:01:08,260
What's going on?

3656
03:01:09,280 --> 03:01:11,600
Guys, do you think she likes me?

3657
03:01:12,220 --> 03:01:13,040
Alright, guys.

3658
03:01:14,520 --> 03:01:16,680
Guys, do you think she likes me, guys?

3659
03:01:16,920 --> 03:01:17,700
She's...

3660
03:01:17,700 --> 03:01:19,260
She's just...

3661
03:01:19,260 --> 03:01:22,860
She's just really enjoying TV, chat.

3662
03:01:24,440 --> 03:01:25,400
Like...

3663
03:01:26,260 --> 03:01:27,060
She's...

3664
03:01:28,260 --> 03:01:28,840
She's...

3665
03:01:28,840 --> 03:01:31,700
I wonder what she's watching right now.

3666
03:01:31,820 --> 03:01:33,160
I wonder...

3667
03:01:33,160 --> 03:01:37,240
I wonder what she's watching at the moment, chat.

3668
03:01:37,520 --> 03:01:39,040
Could be anything.

3669
03:01:43,750 --> 03:01:45,510
I'm the pervert!

3670
03:01:45,510 --> 03:01:50,510
She sent this to me and I'm the pervert!

3671
03:01:51,570 --> 03:01:52,290
Okay.

3672
03:01:53,030 --> 03:01:53,710
Alright.

3673
03:01:54,590 --> 03:01:56,710
What a wild ride there.

3674
03:01:58,290 --> 03:02:03,170
Guys, I don't even want to talk to these ladies anymore.

3675
03:02:03,390 --> 03:02:03,850
I just...

3676
03:02:03,850 --> 03:02:06,490
I'm just gonna wait until this date night.

3677
03:02:08,850 --> 03:02:10,290
I'm just...

3678
03:02:10,290 --> 03:02:11,130
I'm sorry.

3679
03:02:11,390 --> 03:02:11,810
I don't...

3680
03:02:13,730 --> 03:02:15,210
Oh my God.

3681
03:02:15,210 --> 03:02:15,530
Yes!

3682
03:02:21,680 --> 03:02:23,080
Oh my God.

3683
03:02:25,380 --> 03:02:26,700
You wanna...

3684
03:02:27,140 --> 03:02:29,820
You wanna go on a...

3685
03:02:29,820 --> 03:02:30,980
On a...

3686
03:02:30,980 --> 03:02:31,800
On a...

3687
03:02:32,860 --> 03:02:33,740
Date...

3688
03:02:33,740 --> 03:02:36,580
Wait, how do I...

3689
03:02:37,280 --> 03:02:38,460
How do I...

3690
03:02:38,460 --> 03:02:39,800
Go on this date?

3691
03:02:41,340 --> 03:02:42,700
Wait, I got denied?

3692
03:02:45,020 --> 03:02:46,740
How do I get denied?

3693
03:02:48,060 --> 03:02:50,840
She doesn't even want to go on a date with me.

3694
03:02:52,180 --> 03:02:54,020
Wait, what do I get, chat?

3695
03:02:54,820 --> 03:02:55,800
Guys, what do I...

3696
03:02:55,800 --> 03:02:57,380
At the wizard tomorrow?

3697
03:02:59,720 --> 03:03:00,260
What?

3698
03:03:00,980 --> 03:03:02,420
Guys, what do I get, guys?

3699
03:03:02,680 --> 03:03:04,040
Guys, I need to know.

3700
03:03:05,940 --> 03:03:06,480
Pink?

3701
03:03:07,000 --> 03:03:07,400
Passion?

3702
03:03:09,900 --> 03:03:10,440
Passion.

3703
03:03:10,660 --> 03:03:11,000
Okay.

3704
03:03:11,680 --> 03:03:12,100
Alright.

3705
03:03:12,100 --> 03:03:13,000
Alright, I'm gonna...

3706
03:03:13,000 --> 03:03:13,980
I'm skipping this.

3707
03:03:14,100 --> 03:03:14,460
I...

3708
03:03:15,180 --> 03:03:17,240
I'm fucking rotating this a day.

3709
03:03:17,420 --> 03:03:17,740
I...

3710
03:03:17,740 --> 03:03:18,480
I can't.

3711
03:03:18,520 --> 03:03:18,880
I'm...

3712
03:03:19,920 --> 03:03:20,480
I...

3713
03:03:20,480 --> 03:03:21,480
Oh my God.

3714
03:03:21,780 --> 03:03:22,340
I...

3715
03:03:22,340 --> 03:03:22,680
I...

3716
03:03:22,680 --> 03:03:23,380
There's...

3717
03:03:23,380 --> 03:03:24,580
Other than...

3718
03:03:24,580 --> 03:03:26,140
Alright, morning time.

3719
03:03:26,480 --> 03:03:28,780
Okay, we just gotta wait until it's night time.

3720
03:03:29,360 --> 03:03:29,660
Alright.

3721
03:03:30,940 --> 03:03:32,380
You're gonna take too long.

3722
03:03:33,580 --> 03:03:34,140
I...

3723
03:03:35,020 --> 03:03:36,020
Alright, what size?

3724
03:03:36,100 --> 03:03:37,820
Oh, you're also the D cup.

3725
03:03:37,880 --> 03:03:39,580
I only know two bust sizes.

3726
03:03:39,580 --> 03:03:41,280
And they're both D.

3727
03:03:42,400 --> 03:03:43,780
I can do Tiffany now?

3728
03:03:44,420 --> 03:03:45,100
Okay.

3729
03:03:45,860 --> 03:03:46,520
Hey, Tiffany.

3730
03:03:49,700 --> 03:03:51,640
Wow, I really like the gym.

3731
03:03:51,780 --> 03:03:52,060
Okay.

3732
03:03:53,560 --> 03:03:53,940
Alright.

3733
03:03:57,460 --> 03:03:58,600
Hey, Tiffany.

3734
03:03:59,240 --> 03:04:00,740
I love hiking.

3735
03:04:14,500 --> 03:04:15,180
Okay.

3736
03:04:17,520 --> 03:04:18,760
Let's do this again.

3737
03:04:27,140 --> 03:04:28,680
Oh, thank God, bro.

3738
03:04:28,780 --> 03:04:31,320
I feel like I'm fucking gambling every time.

3739
03:04:31,580 --> 03:04:33,080
Oh, thank God.

3740
03:04:35,160 --> 03:04:35,740
God.

3741
03:04:36,480 --> 03:04:39,300
This feels like a goddamn gamble.

3742
03:04:40,560 --> 03:04:40,920
Okay.

3743
03:04:41,740 --> 03:04:43,060
Wanna go on a...

3744
03:04:43,060 --> 03:04:43,720
You wanna...

3745
03:04:43,720 --> 03:04:44,320
You have a gift?

3746
03:04:44,460 --> 03:04:44,980
Oh, I can.

3747
03:04:45,160 --> 03:04:45,460
Okay.

3748
03:04:47,100 --> 03:04:48,180
Okay, nice.

3749
03:04:48,340 --> 03:04:48,680
Alright.

3750
03:04:49,120 --> 03:04:50,160
Oh, I have two!

3751
03:04:50,960 --> 03:04:56,180
Consume a select broken tokens plus one move for every four of a kind?

3752
03:04:56,620 --> 03:04:57,680
Wait, that's great.

3753
03:04:58,520 --> 03:05:00,840
And I guess we'll take away the perfume, right?

3754
03:05:03,870 --> 03:05:04,940
And we'll do this.

3755
03:05:05,620 --> 03:05:06,420
Eyelash curler.

3756
03:05:06,580 --> 03:05:06,860
Okay.

3757
03:05:08,720 --> 03:05:10,560
Oh, don't date until nighttime?

3758
03:05:11,380 --> 03:05:12,160
I'm just...

3759
03:05:12,160 --> 03:05:13,120
I'm gonna travel.

3760
03:05:16,940 --> 03:05:18,340
I'm traveling.

3761
03:05:20,160 --> 03:05:21,180
Alright, guys.

3762
03:05:21,580 --> 03:05:24,540
Who would've thought it was gonna be the teach...

3763
03:05:24,540 --> 03:05:26,620
I'm not gonna talk to her.

3764
03:05:27,300 --> 03:05:29,740
I can barely remember all the women.

3765
03:05:31,360 --> 03:05:32,780
You wanna drink?

3766
03:05:32,920 --> 03:05:33,900
Oh, you might as well.

3767
03:05:33,940 --> 03:05:34,680
Let's just talk.

3768
03:05:34,800 --> 03:05:35,460
You wanna...

3769
03:05:36,940 --> 03:05:38,180
Oh, I got a good one?

3770
03:05:39,800 --> 03:05:40,320
Okay.

3771
03:05:42,960 --> 03:05:43,480
Fuck.

3772
03:05:43,720 --> 03:05:44,060
Okay.

3773
03:05:47,580 --> 03:05:48,440
You know what?

3774
03:05:48,440 --> 03:05:49,460
You're not even endgame.

3775
03:05:52,780 --> 03:05:54,460
You're not even endgame.

3776
03:05:57,280 --> 03:05:58,300
What's my fav...

3777
03:05:58,300 --> 03:05:59,100
Oh, it's Lilac.

3778
03:05:59,180 --> 03:05:59,600
I remember.

3779
03:06:01,700 --> 03:06:04,320
It doesn't matter what I say to her.

3780
03:06:04,860 --> 03:06:05,240
I...

3781
03:06:05,240 --> 03:06:06,180
Oh, man.

3782
03:06:06,560 --> 03:06:08,260
That's crazy.

3783
03:06:09,140 --> 03:06:10,820
It doesn't matter.

3784
03:06:10,960 --> 03:06:12,660
She's not endgame.

3785
03:06:12,660 --> 03:06:13,380
Hmm?

3786
03:06:17,340 --> 03:06:17,940
Alright.

3787
03:06:18,920 --> 03:06:20,120
You're perfect.

3788
03:06:20,840 --> 03:06:21,540
But what if...

3789
03:06:21,540 --> 03:06:24,500
Oh, my God.

3790
03:06:24,580 --> 03:06:26,240
What do you want from me?

3791
03:06:28,180 --> 03:06:29,540
Okay, go buy your own food.

3792
03:06:29,660 --> 03:06:30,300
I'm fucking...

3793
03:06:30,300 --> 03:06:30,960
I need it.

3794
03:06:31,560 --> 03:06:32,500
Alright, guys.

3795
03:06:32,960 --> 03:06:33,400
Okay.

3796
03:06:33,920 --> 03:06:35,500
Alright, who's endgame, guys?

3797
03:06:35,940 --> 03:06:36,680
Actually, no.

3798
03:06:36,740 --> 03:06:37,840
Because I could fuck up.

3799
03:06:37,840 --> 03:06:38,420
Oh, God.

3800
03:06:38,940 --> 03:06:40,600
I can't fuck this up.

3801
03:06:44,950 --> 03:06:45,550
Okay.

3802
03:06:46,590 --> 03:06:48,850
You know, Aiko was there for me in the beginning.

3803
03:06:48,930 --> 03:06:50,790
She was the easiest to read, guys.

3804
03:06:52,050 --> 03:06:52,650
Aiko...

3805
03:06:52,650 --> 03:06:54,210
Aiko knew what I wanted.

3806
03:06:54,510 --> 03:06:56,110
And I knew what Aiko wanted.

3807
03:06:58,830 --> 03:06:59,730
It's time.

3808
03:07:01,230 --> 03:07:01,730
Alright.

3809
03:07:02,930 --> 03:07:03,530
It's...

3810
03:07:03,530 --> 03:07:05,050
Oh, fuck.

3811
03:07:05,050 --> 03:07:05,550
It's time.

3812
03:07:05,690 --> 03:07:06,010
Okay.

3813
03:07:06,450 --> 03:07:06,710
No.

3814
03:07:06,910 --> 03:07:07,450
Fuck.

3815
03:07:08,570 --> 03:07:09,170
Alright.

3816
03:07:09,170 --> 03:07:09,890
Okay.

3817
03:07:11,070 --> 03:07:11,550
Alright.

3818
03:07:13,030 --> 03:07:13,510
Okay.

3819
03:07:14,730 --> 03:07:15,210
Alright.

3820
03:07:16,950 --> 03:07:17,430
Alright.

3821
03:07:18,650 --> 03:07:19,070
Wow.

3822
03:07:21,850 --> 03:07:22,330
Okay.

3823
03:07:22,930 --> 03:07:23,750
Wait, get her...

3824
03:07:23,750 --> 03:07:24,590
Get her a drink?

3825
03:07:24,710 --> 03:07:25,890
Okay, I'll get her a drink.

3826
03:07:25,970 --> 03:07:26,710
Where's the sake?

3827
03:07:27,710 --> 03:07:29,230
I know she likes sake.

3828
03:07:29,590 --> 03:07:30,910
Wait, is there no sake anymore?

3829
03:07:31,410 --> 03:07:32,310
Oh, there it is.

3830
03:07:32,390 --> 03:07:32,650
Alright.

3831
03:07:33,350 --> 03:07:34,590
Why do I need to get her a drink?

3832
03:07:36,170 --> 03:07:36,890
Where's the sake?

3833
03:07:36,950 --> 03:07:37,130
No.

3834
03:07:38,430 --> 03:07:39,250
Wait, why?

3835
03:07:41,310 --> 03:07:42,450
Why do I need a drink?

3836
03:07:42,670 --> 03:07:43,430
Give her...

3837
03:07:43,430 --> 03:07:44,280
Why do I need to give...

3838
03:07:44,930 --> 03:07:46,430
Oh, it makes it easier?

3839
03:07:47,590 --> 03:07:49,270
Does it have to be her favorite drink?

3840
03:07:50,290 --> 03:07:51,210
Wait, I got...

3841
03:07:51,210 --> 03:07:52,530
Wait, it makes the game easier?

3842
03:07:52,690 --> 03:07:53,430
Oh my god.

3843
03:07:53,630 --> 03:07:54,210
You say...

3844
03:07:54,210 --> 03:07:55,650
Why you tell me that now?

3845
03:07:58,250 --> 03:07:58,670
Fucking...

3846
03:07:59,970 --> 03:08:00,390
Okay.

3847
03:08:01,950 --> 03:08:02,790
This feels...

3848
03:08:02,790 --> 03:08:03,390
Here's beer.

3849
03:08:03,490 --> 03:08:04,010
It was cheap.

3850
03:08:07,790 --> 03:08:08,390
Alright.

3851
03:08:09,770 --> 03:08:10,350
Okay.

3852
03:08:10,690 --> 03:08:11,290
Is it...

3853
03:08:11,290 --> 03:08:11,890
Are we ready?

3854
03:08:13,990 --> 03:08:15,010
Are we...

3855
03:08:15,010 --> 03:08:16,690
Are we good to go?

3856
03:08:16,790 --> 03:08:17,570
And food?

3857
03:08:18,370 --> 03:08:18,750
Alright.

3858
03:08:19,210 --> 03:08:19,930
What's your favorite?

3859
03:08:20,030 --> 03:08:20,470
You know what?

3860
03:08:20,530 --> 03:08:22,810
I feel like I can spoil you today.

3861
03:08:24,410 --> 03:08:25,010
Alright.

3862
03:08:25,270 --> 03:08:25,950
One more.

3863
03:08:26,930 --> 03:08:27,930
One more to go.

3864
03:08:29,510 --> 03:08:30,190
You know what?

3865
03:08:30,330 --> 03:08:30,770
Oh, tomato.

3866
03:08:32,490 --> 03:08:33,090
Alright.

3867
03:08:33,390 --> 03:08:34,470
Tomatoes is her favorite.

3868
03:08:34,850 --> 03:08:35,230
Alright!

3869
03:08:35,230 --> 03:08:36,950
Here we go!

3870
03:08:40,430 --> 03:08:40,970
Talk?

3871
03:08:41,290 --> 03:08:42,130
Talk with her?

3872
03:08:43,550 --> 03:08:45,990
Do we talk with her or do we go on a date?

3873
03:08:47,830 --> 03:08:48,730
It was destiny.

3874
03:08:49,290 --> 03:08:50,750
Her favorite food is tomatoes.

3875
03:08:59,160 --> 03:08:59,700
Censor?!

3876
03:09:03,300 --> 03:09:04,320
Wait, why?

3877
03:09:06,680 --> 03:09:08,220
Oh, Port Bar and Lounge.

3878
03:09:08,260 --> 03:09:08,780
Let's go.

3879
03:09:10,640 --> 03:09:12,940
What's she gonna wear?

3880
03:09:15,320 --> 03:09:16,020
Yeah!

3881
03:09:17,880 --> 03:09:18,580
Alright.

3882
03:09:22,340 --> 03:09:23,040
Okay.

3883
03:09:24,900 --> 03:09:25,560
Heart.

3884
03:09:29,150 --> 03:09:30,910
Yeah, it's not that bad.

3885
03:09:34,190 --> 03:09:34,890
Alright.

3886
03:09:40,110 --> 03:09:40,810
Okay.

3887
03:09:43,270 --> 03:09:47,270
Yo, can you preemptively censor the right side of the screen if you succeed on this date?

3888
03:09:47,690 --> 03:09:48,470
She will.

3889
03:09:49,710 --> 03:09:50,270
Woah.

3890
03:09:52,530 --> 03:09:53,090
Alright.

3891
03:09:53,370 --> 03:09:53,850
Alright.

3892
03:09:54,010 --> 03:09:54,170
Delete.

3893
03:09:54,310 --> 03:09:55,250
Thank you for the super chat.

3894
03:09:55,350 --> 03:09:55,630
Thank you.

3895
03:09:55,690 --> 03:09:56,330
Thank you.

3896
03:09:56,410 --> 03:09:56,550
Okay.

3897
03:09:56,990 --> 03:09:57,550
Alright.

3898
03:09:58,350 --> 03:09:58,910
Woah.

3899
03:09:59,010 --> 03:09:59,450
Okay.

3900
03:10:00,310 --> 03:10:01,530
Oh my god.

3901
03:10:01,590 --> 03:10:01,970
Okay.

3902
03:10:04,910 --> 03:10:05,470
Wow.

3903
03:10:07,050 --> 03:10:07,610
Wowee.

3904
03:10:08,170 --> 03:10:08,730
Wowza.

3905
03:10:09,210 --> 03:10:09,490
Hahaha.

3906
03:10:10,610 --> 03:10:11,990
Alright, I'll do reds here.

3907
03:10:13,530 --> 03:10:14,370
Um...

3908
03:10:14,990 --> 03:10:17,070
And then four reds here.

3909
03:10:18,130 --> 03:10:18,970
Alright.

3910
03:10:20,570 --> 03:10:21,410
Wowee.

3911
03:10:22,390 --> 03:10:24,510
Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.

3912
03:10:24,790 --> 03:10:26,050
Wow, wow.

3913
03:10:27,050 --> 03:10:28,350
Wait, no?

3914
03:10:28,830 --> 03:10:29,270
Why?

3915
03:10:31,530 --> 03:10:32,370
Okay.

3916
03:10:34,130 --> 03:10:35,750
I think I'm doing okay.

3917
03:10:36,450 --> 03:10:36,850
Hahaha.

3918
03:10:40,290 --> 03:10:41,970
I think...

3919
03:10:41,970 --> 03:10:42,590
I'm getting flustered right now.

3920
03:10:42,810 --> 03:10:43,610
Okay.

3921
03:10:44,170 --> 03:10:47,490
I think things are going quite dandy.

3922
03:10:51,810 --> 03:10:52,330
Um...

3923
03:10:52,330 --> 03:10:53,010
Wowee.

3924
03:10:53,230 --> 03:10:54,230
Zowie mama.

3925
03:10:56,290 --> 03:10:57,670
Not okay.

3926
03:10:58,410 --> 03:11:00,510
I'm getting flustered right now.

3927
03:11:01,790 --> 03:11:05,290
I'm getting a little flustered.

3928
03:11:05,710 --> 03:11:07,770
I'm getting a little...

3929
03:11:08,350 --> 03:11:09,370
Not bad.

3930
03:11:10,430 --> 03:11:11,670
Oh my god, I'm doing it.

3931
03:11:11,710 --> 03:11:12,510
I don't know how.

3932
03:11:14,830 --> 03:11:15,270
Alright.

3933
03:11:17,170 --> 03:11:18,050
And then...

3934
03:11:18,050 --> 03:11:18,430
You know what?

3935
03:11:18,650 --> 03:11:19,090
Convert.

3936
03:11:20,730 --> 03:11:22,090
Alright, here we go.

3937
03:11:24,870 --> 03:11:26,930
I was getting a little scared, guys.

3938
03:11:27,470 --> 03:11:28,810
I was getting very scared.

3939
03:11:29,170 --> 03:11:29,390
Hahaha.

3940
03:11:29,770 --> 03:11:31,610
I was getting very scared.

3941
03:11:32,310 --> 03:11:32,530
Hahaha.

3942
03:11:35,350 --> 03:11:35,790
Orange.

3943
03:11:36,370 --> 03:11:36,810
Uh...

3944
03:11:36,810 --> 03:11:37,410
Which one?

3945
03:11:37,490 --> 03:11:39,410
There's so many or- Oh wait, I can do reds here though.

3946
03:11:40,790 --> 03:11:41,230
Yeah!

3947
03:11:41,670 --> 03:11:42,830
And then I can do another red here.

3948
03:11:43,530 --> 03:11:43,850
Yay!

3949
03:11:50,960 --> 03:11:52,320
Julia, thank you for the superchat.

3950
03:11:52,440 --> 03:11:53,120
Thank you, thank you.

3951
03:11:53,180 --> 03:11:55,040
You're gonna need this for when...

3952
03:11:55,040 --> 03:11:55,640
Wait, what?

3953
03:11:56,480 --> 03:11:57,200
What do you mean?

3954
03:11:57,940 --> 03:11:59,120
It can't be that bad.

3955
03:11:59,640 --> 03:12:00,880
What's the worst that could happen?

3956
03:12:03,840 --> 03:12:04,720
What's the...

3957
03:12:04,720 --> 03:12:06,780
What's the worst that could happen?

3958
03:12:09,200 --> 03:12:09,640
What's...

3959
03:12:10,100 --> 03:12:12,280
Oh man, what's the worst that could happen?

3960
03:12:13,140 --> 03:12:14,020
What's the...

3961
03:12:14,020 --> 03:12:15,040
Whoa, what?

3962
03:12:16,020 --> 03:12:17,440
Four hearts?

3963
03:12:18,100 --> 03:12:20,320
Where the fuck you seeing this four hearts?

3964
03:12:22,140 --> 03:12:23,300
That's three.

3965
03:12:23,660 --> 03:12:24,880
That's three.

3966
03:12:25,380 --> 03:12:26,620
That's two.

3967
03:12:27,380 --> 03:12:28,700
That's three.

3968
03:12:30,360 --> 03:12:32,900
Guys, you gotta talk to me in battleship terms.

3969
03:12:33,480 --> 03:12:34,100
You gotta...

3970
03:12:34,100 --> 03:12:34,480
Hahaha.

3971
03:12:34,820 --> 03:12:35,520
You gotta...

3972
03:12:35,520 --> 03:12:37,980
This gotta be done in battleships.

3973
03:12:38,100 --> 03:12:38,840
Oh, there's four.

3974
03:12:39,980 --> 03:12:40,120
Alright.

3975
03:12:40,700 --> 03:12:41,540
That's fine.

3976
03:12:44,160 --> 03:12:44,880
Alright.

3977
03:12:46,180 --> 03:12:47,040
Do this.

3978
03:12:48,580 --> 03:12:49,700
And then...

3979
03:12:49,700 --> 03:12:51,220
We do orange.

3980
03:12:52,440 --> 03:12:54,620
E4 and a G4.

3981
03:12:55,720 --> 03:12:56,880
Alright, guys.

3982
03:12:58,100 --> 03:13:00,160
We gotta figure this out now together.

3983
03:13:00,420 --> 03:13:01,000
Four blue.

3984
03:13:02,660 --> 03:13:04,220
Oh, there's four blue right here.

3985
03:13:06,660 --> 03:13:08,320
And then there's...

3986
03:13:08,320 --> 03:13:09,100
Four red.

3987
03:13:09,280 --> 03:13:09,840
Four...

3988
03:13:09,840 --> 03:13:11,280
Wait, four red.

3989
03:13:12,020 --> 03:13:13,060
This is so risky.

3990
03:13:13,060 --> 03:13:14,880
Oh my God, that was so risky.

3991
03:13:15,400 --> 03:13:18,240
Oh, that's so risky.

3992
03:13:19,020 --> 03:13:19,660
Alright.

3993
03:13:20,920 --> 03:13:21,560
Okay.

3994
03:13:22,760 --> 03:13:23,940
Oh, we're almost there.

3995
03:13:28,760 --> 03:13:29,080
Why?

3996
03:13:29,180 --> 03:13:30,360
We're not close yet.

3997
03:13:30,880 --> 03:13:31,980
We should be fine.

3998
03:13:32,780 --> 03:13:33,260
Right?

3999
03:13:35,940 --> 03:13:37,620
Guys, we should be fine.

4000
03:13:37,700 --> 03:13:38,740
We're not there yet.

4001
03:13:39,800 --> 03:13:43,520
This is nothing bad's gonna happen yet, guys.

4002
03:13:45,960 --> 03:13:47,820
And then we get an extra turn.

4003
03:13:50,080 --> 03:13:51,800
Like, look, she's...

4004
03:13:51,800 --> 03:13:53,000
She's okay.

4005
03:14:11,660 --> 03:14:15,940
Oh, my bedroom.

4006
03:14:33,970 --> 03:14:36,890
I think that's where they are.

4007
03:14:43,630 --> 03:14:45,230
Alright, let's...

4008
03:14:45,230 --> 03:14:46,190
Let's go gambling.

4009
03:14:52,050 --> 03:14:54,650
That was not where they are.

4010
03:14:57,650 --> 03:15:00,570
That was not where they are.

4011
03:15:00,810 --> 03:15:01,670
That's fine.

4012
03:15:02,090 --> 03:15:03,550
We got it.

4013
03:15:03,570 --> 03:15:04,110
Okay.

4014
03:15:05,150 --> 03:15:05,670
It's...

4015
03:15:06,750 --> 03:15:07,790
It's okay.

4016
03:15:08,170 --> 03:15:09,010
It's okay.

4017
03:15:09,410 --> 03:15:09,970
It was almost...

4018
03:15:11,250 --> 03:15:11,770
We...

4019
03:15:11,770 --> 03:15:13,490
The bottle won't move!

4020
03:15:13,870 --> 03:15:14,770
Okay, alright.

4021
03:15:15,090 --> 03:15:15,850
Let's see.

4022
03:15:16,410 --> 03:15:16,970
No, it won't.

4023
03:15:17,010 --> 03:15:18,010
It doesn't move that much.

4024
03:15:19,790 --> 03:15:20,690
Okay, you're right.

4025
03:15:20,750 --> 03:15:21,650
We might need one more.

4026
03:15:21,730 --> 03:15:22,950
Let's just...

4027
03:15:22,950 --> 03:15:23,990
Let's just...

4028
03:15:23,990 --> 03:15:24,430
Okay.

4029
03:15:24,710 --> 03:15:26,370
Oh my God.

4030
03:15:26,390 --> 03:15:28,510
I didn't think this game would go so long.

4031
03:15:28,590 --> 03:15:29,510
But here we go.

4032
03:15:29,550 --> 03:15:29,950
Alright.

4033
03:15:30,690 --> 03:15:31,170
Go ahead.

4034
03:15:31,490 --> 03:15:33,010
I could do whatever the fuck I...

4035
03:15:42,450 --> 03:15:43,950
Let me turn this.

4036
03:15:48,600 --> 03:15:49,040
Alright.

4037
03:15:49,560 --> 03:15:49,900
Don't worry.

4038
03:15:50,000 --> 03:15:51,280
I'll make my own sound.

4039
03:15:54,160 --> 03:15:55,540
She's like going...

4040
03:15:56,260 --> 03:15:57,580
Wow, wow, wow, wow!

4041
03:15:57,860 --> 03:15:58,000
Woo!

4042
03:15:58,960 --> 03:15:59,340
Yeah!

4043
03:15:59,540 --> 03:15:59,920
Wow!

4044
03:16:00,360 --> 03:16:00,760
Yeah!

4045
03:16:01,500 --> 03:16:01,800
Woo!

4046
03:16:02,920 --> 03:16:04,260
Let's go!

4047
03:16:04,440 --> 03:16:05,200
Wowee!

4048
03:16:10,390 --> 03:16:11,150
Yoohoohoo!

4049
03:16:13,030 --> 03:16:14,550
I know.

4050
03:16:14,930 --> 03:16:15,350
Yeah!

4051
03:16:16,010 --> 03:16:16,390
Wowee!

4052
03:16:19,850 --> 03:16:20,310
Yeah!

4053
03:16:21,410 --> 03:16:22,130
Yippee!

4054
03:16:22,330 --> 03:16:22,610
Yeah!

4055
03:16:22,750 --> 03:16:23,130
Yeah!

4056
03:16:23,670 --> 03:16:24,570
Yippee-ki-yay!

4057
03:16:26,050 --> 03:16:27,310
Oh my God!

4058
03:16:27,390 --> 03:16:27,750
Yeah!

4059
03:16:29,050 --> 03:16:30,030
Oh my God.

4060
03:16:30,030 --> 03:16:31,330
How fast do I have to go?

4061
03:16:32,310 --> 03:16:32,670
Jesus!

4062
03:16:33,750 --> 03:16:34,370
I

4063
03:16:39,580 --> 03:16:42,140
went too fast.

4064
03:16:56,700 --> 03:16:57,900
I went too fast.

4065
03:16:58,620 --> 03:17:00,020
I did not realize.

4066
03:17:02,760 --> 03:17:03,120
I...

4067
03:17:04,940 --> 03:17:05,660
I...

4068
03:17:07,080 --> 03:17:08,800
I didn't know.

4069
03:17:09,640 --> 03:17:10,080
I...

4070
03:17:11,820 --> 03:17:12,700
I...

4071
03:17:12,700 --> 03:17:15,200
I didn't know.

4072
03:17:19,350 --> 03:17:20,230
I...

4073
03:17:21,130 --> 03:17:22,930
I didn't know.

4074
03:17:23,390 --> 03:17:26,070
I didn't know she'd take her clothes off.

4075
03:17:26,790 --> 03:17:27,590
I...

4076
03:17:27,590 --> 03:17:30,970
I didn't know her clothes would be off.

4077
03:17:35,660 --> 03:17:36,540
Guys...

4078
03:17:36,540 --> 03:17:38,040
We're gonna lock that in.

4079
03:17:38,820 --> 03:17:39,820
Okay, and then...

4080
03:17:39,840 --> 03:17:41,700
We're still safe here.

4081
03:17:42,020 --> 03:17:43,340
We're still...

4082
03:17:43,340 --> 03:17:45,600
We're still a little safe here.

4083
03:17:46,280 --> 03:17:47,160
I...

4084
03:17:47,820 --> 03:17:49,040
I didn't know.

4085
03:17:50,500 --> 03:17:50,940
I...

4086
03:17:51,380 --> 03:17:52,940
I didn't...

4087
03:17:52,940 --> 03:17:55,340
Oh my God, this is so not safe.

4088
03:17:56,960 --> 03:18:00,000
This is so not safe, guys.

4089
03:18:00,900 --> 03:18:03,300
This is so not safe.

4090
03:18:05,040 --> 03:18:06,800
This is...

4091
03:18:11,320 --> 03:18:11,860
This...

4092
03:18:11,860 --> 03:18:14,660
This is not safe at all.

4093
03:18:21,360 --> 03:18:23,060
Guys, you guys don't wanna play but you won't.

4094
03:18:27,620 --> 03:18:32,280
Okay, I feel a little more confident.

4095
03:18:42,620 --> 03:18:43,300
I...

4096
03:18:43,300 --> 03:18:44,260
I...

4097
03:18:44,260 --> 03:18:44,560
I...

4098
03:18:44,560 --> 03:18:44,800
I...

4099
03:18:44,800 --> 03:18:46,140
There we go.

4100
03:18:46,200 --> 03:18:47,160
There we go.

4101
03:18:47,180 --> 03:18:47,640
We did it.

4102
03:18:48,460 --> 03:18:49,080
There we go.

4103
03:18:49,120 --> 03:18:49,560
Wow!

4104
03:18:49,860 --> 03:18:51,960
We did it.

4105
03:18:52,000 --> 03:18:53,520
We're just playing Bejeweled now.

4106
03:18:54,020 --> 03:18:56,060
Like, it's Bejeweled time.

4107
03:18:57,040 --> 03:18:59,000
It's Bejeweled time.

4108
03:18:59,400 --> 03:18:59,640
Okay.

4109
03:19:00,120 --> 03:19:00,840
We're just...

4110
03:19:00,840 --> 03:19:04,160
We're just having a fun Bejeweled hours.

4111
03:19:05,840 --> 03:19:06,520
Bejeweled...

4112
03:19:06,520 --> 03:19:09,040
Oh my God, I can't.

4113
03:19:11,840 --> 03:19:13,480
I can't.

4114
03:19:13,680 --> 03:19:14,760
I can't.

4115
03:19:14,900 --> 03:19:15,180
I can't.

4116
03:19:15,180 --> 03:19:16,200
Oh my God.

4117
03:19:17,500 --> 03:19:19,700
Oh my God, I...

4118
03:19:21,860 --> 03:19:23,160
I can't.

4119
03:19:23,300 --> 03:19:23,940
I can't.

4120
03:19:24,920 --> 03:19:26,100
I can't.

4121
03:19:27,040 --> 03:19:31,200
Guys, this will be fun.

4122
03:19:31,440 --> 03:19:33,800
Everything will be fun.

4123
03:19:33,920 --> 03:19:34,840
You guys...

4124
03:19:34,840 --> 03:19:36,260
Oh my God, I can't.

4125
03:19:37,880 --> 03:19:38,700
Wowee!

4126
03:19:40,720 --> 03:19:41,520
Wowee!

4127
03:19:41,560 --> 03:19:43,120
I'm not fast enough.

4128
03:19:43,340 --> 03:19:44,340
I can't.

4129
03:19:44,360 --> 03:19:45,560
I'm sorry, ma'am.

4130
03:19:45,720 --> 03:19:48,000
I'm just not fast enough.

4131
03:19:48,120 --> 03:19:48,800
I'm sorry.

4132
03:19:49,380 --> 03:19:50,620
I'm sorry.

4133
03:19:50,760 --> 03:19:53,600
I can't be as fast as you want me.

4134
03:19:54,320 --> 03:19:55,600
Oh my God.

4135
03:19:55,700 --> 03:19:56,160
Okay.

4136
03:19:57,000 --> 03:19:57,800
Okay.

4137
03:19:58,180 --> 03:19:58,680
I'm done.

4138
03:19:59,160 --> 03:19:59,880
Oh my God.

4139
03:20:01,560 --> 03:20:02,620
I'm done.

4140
03:20:03,180 --> 03:20:03,980
Oh my God.

4141
03:20:05,460 --> 03:20:07,900
Slow and steady wins the race.

4142
03:20:07,900 --> 03:20:09,000
I'm panicking.

4143
03:20:09,380 --> 03:20:10,240
I don't...

4144
03:20:10,840 --> 03:20:13,060
Oh my God, I lost all the progress.

4145
03:20:13,380 --> 03:20:14,660
I'm so slow.

4146
03:20:14,660 --> 03:20:14,820
I'm so slow.

4147
03:20:14,900 --> 03:20:15,520
I'm sorry.

4148
03:20:15,960 --> 03:20:17,320
I'm sorry, ma'am.

4149
03:20:17,360 --> 03:20:18,720
Can you please teach me?

4150
03:20:19,200 --> 03:20:21,200
I'm so sorry.

4151
03:20:22,820 --> 03:20:24,260
I'm just...

4152
03:20:24,260 --> 03:20:24,900
Wowee.

4153
03:20:26,980 --> 03:20:28,720
I just need a B.

4154
03:20:28,880 --> 03:20:29,660
Oh my God.

4155
03:20:29,700 --> 03:20:30,800
Please hold my hand.

4156
03:20:31,220 --> 03:20:32,800
Please hold my hand.

4157
03:20:34,460 --> 03:20:35,700
Oh my God.

4158
03:20:35,700 --> 03:20:36,980
I'm so embarrassed.

4159
03:20:37,640 --> 03:20:38,780
Oh shit.

4160
03:20:38,780 --> 03:20:41,020
She's making all these sounds.

4161
03:20:41,520 --> 03:20:42,340
She's...

4162
03:20:43,820 --> 03:20:44,700
No.

4163
03:20:44,920 --> 03:20:45,140
No.

4164
03:20:45,320 --> 03:20:45,620
No.

4165
03:20:45,720 --> 03:20:46,160
No.

4166
03:20:46,160 --> 03:20:46,520
No.

4167
03:20:46,660 --> 03:20:47,380
No.

4168
03:20:47,800 --> 03:20:48,320
Stop.

4169
03:20:48,880 --> 03:20:49,200
Stop.

4170
03:20:49,860 --> 03:20:52,580
I just want to play Benchmode, ma'am.

4171
03:20:52,660 --> 03:20:53,380
I just...

4172
03:20:53,980 --> 03:20:57,400
I just wanted to play Benchmode.

4173
03:20:58,440 --> 03:20:59,320
I...

4174
03:20:59,320 --> 03:20:59,860
Please.

4175
03:21:01,000 --> 03:21:01,740
Please.

4176
03:21:02,620 --> 03:21:04,460
I just...

4177
03:21:04,460 --> 03:21:05,040
I...

4178
03:21:05,040 --> 03:21:06,280
I can't.

4179
03:21:06,280 --> 03:21:07,660
I can't focus.

4180
03:21:08,000 --> 03:21:08,480
I just...

4181
03:21:11,260 --> 03:21:12,800
Oh my God.

4182
03:21:13,360 --> 03:21:15,420
No, I'm slowing down again.

4183
03:21:16,060 --> 03:21:17,080
I can't.

4184
03:21:17,420 --> 03:21:18,520
Oh my God.

4185
03:21:18,520 --> 03:21:18,860
Okay.

4186
03:21:19,020 --> 03:21:19,280
Okay.

4187
03:21:19,340 --> 03:21:20,860
I feel a lot more safe now.

4188
03:21:21,480 --> 03:21:22,280
This is fine.

4189
03:21:22,540 --> 03:21:23,320
Everything is...

4190
03:21:23,880 --> 03:21:24,420
Oh my God.

4191
03:21:24,440 --> 03:21:24,680
Okay.

4192
03:21:24,760 --> 03:21:26,140
I feel...

4193
03:21:26,140 --> 03:21:27,860
I just...

4194
03:21:27,860 --> 03:21:28,060
Guys.

4195
03:21:28,420 --> 03:21:30,320
I'm so flustered right now.

4196
03:21:30,400 --> 03:21:32,040
This is not what I expected.

4197
03:21:32,380 --> 03:21:32,660
I...

4198
03:21:33,100 --> 03:21:34,300
I'm back at 100.

4199
03:21:36,280 --> 03:21:36,480
I...

4200
03:21:39,340 --> 03:21:39,920
She's...

4201
03:21:39,920 --> 03:21:45,140
She's saying things and I'm just like, Ma 'am, I just wanted to hold your hand.

4202
03:21:45,380 --> 03:21:46,700
And I...

4203
03:21:46,700 --> 03:21:47,520
Oh my God.

4204
03:21:47,640 --> 03:21:48,600
Back at 100.

4205
03:21:48,920 --> 03:21:49,600
And I...

4206
03:21:50,500 --> 03:21:51,800
You're so pretty.

4207
03:21:53,580 --> 03:21:55,280
You're really beautiful.

4208
03:21:56,120 --> 03:21:56,700
And...

4209
03:21:56,700 --> 03:21:58,220
I think you would make...

4210
03:21:58,220 --> 03:22:01,200
I think you are a wonderful woman.

4211
03:22:02,100 --> 03:22:03,280
And I hope...

4212
03:22:03,280 --> 03:22:04,580
I hope...

4213
03:22:04,580 --> 03:22:05,720
This is not...

4214
03:22:05,720 --> 03:22:07,640
Just a one time thing.

4215
03:22:08,480 --> 03:22:08,860
And...

4216
03:22:09,960 --> 03:22:10,720
And...

4217
03:22:10,720 --> 03:22:15,080
Like that we might be able to see each other again.

4218
03:22:16,140 --> 03:22:16,900
And...

4219
03:22:17,720 --> 03:22:18,340
And...

4220
03:22:18,340 --> 03:22:19,740
I'm sorry.

4221
03:22:20,100 --> 03:22:20,580
I'm...

4222
03:22:20,580 --> 03:22:21,300
I'm sorry.

4223
03:22:21,480 --> 03:22:22,880
I don't know what I'm doing.

4224
03:22:23,860 --> 03:22:26,780
I just wanted to play Bejeweled.

4225
03:22:27,340 --> 03:22:32,640
I'm so sorry for making you wait for so long.

4226
03:22:32,700 --> 03:22:35,000
And I'm still playing anime Bejeweled.

4227
03:22:35,000 --> 03:22:37,920
Because I can't concentrate right now.

4228
03:22:37,920 --> 03:22:39,000
And I...

4229
03:22:39,520 --> 03:22:40,820
Oh my God.

4230
03:22:40,900 --> 03:22:42,900
We're still fucking here.

4231
03:22:44,120 --> 03:22:45,840
I'm at 300.

4232
03:22:46,380 --> 03:22:50,320
I'm just stumbling chat every time I get close enough.

4233
03:22:50,720 --> 03:22:51,480
I just...

4234
03:22:51,480 --> 03:22:53,100
I don't know what to do.

4235
03:22:53,480 --> 03:22:57,120
Like the highest I've ever got to was 400.

4236
03:22:57,460 --> 03:22:58,940
And then she cools down.

4237
03:22:59,100 --> 03:23:00,660
And then I'm like, I'm sorry.

4238
03:23:01,200 --> 03:23:02,400
I'm so sorry.

4239
03:23:02,660 --> 03:23:03,960
I'm trying my best.

4240
03:23:03,960 --> 03:23:06,600
But I can't do it that fast.

4241
03:23:06,700 --> 03:23:07,700
I'm still learning.

4242
03:23:07,920 --> 03:23:09,820
I'm just a young boy.

4243
03:23:10,600 --> 03:23:13,240
I did it.

4244
03:23:15,480 --> 03:23:18,140
She's not saying anything, guys.

4245
03:23:18,260 --> 03:23:18,980
She's not...

4246
03:23:18,980 --> 03:23:20,220
She's not...

4247
03:23:20,960 --> 03:23:22,180
Oh, fuck.

4248
03:23:22,320 --> 03:23:22,720
Okay.

4249
03:23:26,620 --> 03:23:28,780
Does she say more stuff?

4250
03:23:30,180 --> 03:23:33,240
Does she say anything else?

4251
03:23:33,960 --> 03:23:39,600
Because I think I can censor this correctly if I try hard enough.

4252
03:23:40,200 --> 03:23:41,520
I think.

4253
03:23:46,270 --> 03:23:47,330
Thank God.

4254
03:23:48,090 --> 03:23:49,770
Oh, thank God.

4255
03:23:49,910 --> 03:23:50,290
Okay.

4256
03:23:52,350 --> 03:23:53,970
Oh, thank God.

4257
03:23:56,030 --> 03:23:56,950
Oh my God.

4258
03:23:57,330 --> 03:23:59,350
There's no more after this, right?

4259
03:24:00,610 --> 03:24:01,730
Oh, it's okay.

4260
03:24:03,850 --> 03:24:04,610
Alright.

4261
03:24:04,610 --> 03:24:05,230
Okay.

4262
03:24:05,550 --> 03:24:07,750
I got a little bit scared.

4263
03:24:08,730 --> 03:24:10,250
Okay, we're fine.

4264
03:24:13,350 --> 03:24:14,570
We're so fine.

4265
03:24:14,870 --> 03:24:15,610
I can...

4266
03:24:17,510 --> 03:24:20,610
Okay, that might be a little too risky, but...

4267
03:24:21,730 --> 03:24:22,750
Right here.

4268
03:24:23,310 --> 03:24:23,670
Alright.

4269
03:24:23,670 --> 03:24:23,770
Alright.

4270
03:24:30,130 --> 03:24:33,010
Nixxi, thank you for the Akasupa.

4271
03:24:33,150 --> 03:24:34,450
Thank you, thank you.

4272
03:24:35,970 --> 03:24:39,830
Are you as red as this Akasupa right now?

4273
03:24:40,870 --> 03:24:43,570
I hope this works.

4274
03:24:47,370 --> 03:24:48,130
Wait.

4275
03:24:49,610 --> 03:24:51,670
It's not over?!

4276
03:24:52,430 --> 03:24:53,170
What?

4277
03:24:54,570 --> 03:24:55,310
Alright.

4278
03:24:56,450 --> 03:24:57,110
Okay.

4279
03:24:57,450 --> 03:24:58,890
There's more?!

4280
03:24:58,890 --> 03:24:59,690
How much more?

4281
03:24:59,950 --> 03:25:02,470
What the- Oh my God, no!

4282
03:25:09,580 --> 03:25:10,320
Okay.

4283
03:25:16,060 --> 03:25:17,600
Is there- Is there more?

4284
03:25:20,280 --> 03:25:21,520
My bedroom.

4285
03:25:22,380 --> 03:25:23,750
My bedroom warning.

4286
03:25:24,300 --> 03:25:25,740
Oh, she went back to my place.

4287
03:25:28,440 --> 03:25:28,900
Oh my God.

4288
03:25:29,320 --> 03:25:32,200
I'll have to give you some pointers next time.

4289
03:25:35,000 --> 03:25:36,160
That's fine.

4290
03:25:38,440 --> 03:25:39,760
That's...

4291
03:25:40,880 --> 03:25:42,020
That's fine.

4292
03:25:45,540 --> 03:25:46,860
That's...

4293
03:25:49,950 --> 03:25:50,550
Wow.

4294
03:25:53,170 --> 03:25:54,330
Wow.

4295
03:25:56,290 --> 03:25:56,950
Wow.

4296
03:25:59,070 --> 03:25:59,730
Wow.

4297
03:26:04,850 --> 03:26:06,190
I did it.

4298
03:26:07,320 --> 03:26:07,990
Wow.

4299
03:26:25,580 --> 03:26:26,830
I did it.

4300
03:26:33,040 --> 03:26:34,750
I worked so hard.

4301
03:26:36,740 --> 03:26:40,160
I worked so hard to succeed.

4302
03:26:47,740 --> 03:26:52,040
I worked so hard too!

4303
03:26:53,720 --> 03:26:56,860
I got it!

4304
03:26:57,160 --> 03:26:59,190
All that effort...

4305
03:27:10,060 --> 03:27:12,660
Effort what?!

4306
03:27:17,590 --> 03:27:20,520
People are like, go check her profile.

4307
03:27:27,040 --> 03:27:29,280
Guys, is it worth...

4308
03:27:29,280 --> 03:27:33,100
Guys, is it worth like...

4309
03:27:33,880 --> 03:27:36,900
We might not have- We might not have chat.

4310
03:27:37,020 --> 03:27:40,820
I'm gonna- I'm gonna put a black bar over it.

4311
03:27:41,080 --> 03:27:42,940
Oh my God, all that work.

4312
03:27:47,060 --> 03:27:50,000
I played it so perfectly.

4313
03:27:51,000 --> 03:27:53,700
At the very end.

4314
03:27:54,100 --> 03:27:58,920
At the very end.

4315
03:27:59,500 --> 03:28:00,420
Right

4316
03:28:03,710 --> 03:28:12,250
at the end was where everything went down.

4317
03:28:13,490 --> 03:28:14,290
I just...

4318
03:28:14,290 --> 03:28:17,950
I just wanted to look at her profile.

4319
03:28:23,750 --> 03:28:27,010
Why would you put that there?

4320
03:28:31,500 --> 03:28:35,880
Oh my God, I worked so hard to get to this part of the game.

4321
03:28:36,320 --> 03:28:44,040
Alright guys, I'm gonna snip the chat.

4322
03:28:44,260 --> 03:28:45,800
The chat will disappear.

4323
03:28:46,520 --> 03:28:49,480
Because we're gonna edit the pod.

4324
03:28:50,000 --> 03:28:54,340
I can't believe I worked so hard to get to this exact moment.

4325
03:28:54,900 --> 03:28:58,020
And we lost it all at the finish.

4326
03:28:58,020 --> 03:29:04,140
Like, we were one centimeter away from the finish line.

4327
03:29:04,380 --> 03:29:08,620
Just because I looked at the goddamn profile.

4328
03:29:09,360 --> 03:29:10,120
Oh,

4329
03:29:22,830 --> 03:29:25,910
that build up just got ruined at the end.

4330
03:29:26,310 --> 03:29:29,510
I can't help but feel that there's an eye in it.

4331
03:29:32,850 --> 03:29:35,870
I could've just closed the game.

4332
03:29:35,870 --> 03:29:38,550
We could've just closed the game.

4333
03:29:42,810 --> 03:29:45,390
I just had to look at her profile.

4334
03:29:45,610 --> 03:29:49,290
I was like, oh cool, what did I unlock by completing that?

4335
03:29:52,750 --> 03:29:54,730
I just had to close the game.

4336
03:29:54,850 --> 03:29:56,010
She was endgame.

4337
03:29:56,170 --> 03:29:58,130
She literally ended my career.

4338
03:30:00,230 --> 03:30:02,950
Hey Doki, I don't have to worry about a 9-5 job or rush hour.

4339
03:30:03,030 --> 03:30:05,010
Because I have to stream my other monitor while I work.

4340
03:30:05,350 --> 03:30:06,570
Great stream, 10 out of 10.

4341
03:30:06,710 --> 03:30:08,170
I need to go see my boss now.

4342
03:30:08,510 --> 03:30:09,990
Thank you for the super chat, Evian.

4343
03:30:10,450 --> 03:30:12,950
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.

4344
03:30:13,370 --> 03:30:15,870
Liam, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

4345
03:30:17,610 --> 03:30:21,210
No, Kaz, she said she liked being choked, not choking.

4346
03:30:21,550 --> 03:30:23,870
Thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

4347
03:30:25,030 --> 03:30:26,470
Oh my god.

4348
03:30:29,050 --> 03:30:33,070
Just before I get into any more trouble, I'm going to swap the screen.

4349
03:30:33,590 --> 03:30:37,530
I don't want to get into more trouble.

4350
03:30:38,970 --> 03:30:41,050
Poor Fodder is one and all.

4351
03:30:41,690 --> 03:30:42,330
Bear witness.

4352
03:30:42,530 --> 03:30:44,030
Thank you for the super chat, Sterling.

4353
03:30:44,150 --> 03:30:45,970
Thank you, you were all there, everybody.

4354
03:30:46,490 --> 03:30:48,270
You were all here.

4355
03:30:51,890 --> 03:30:54,130
Alright guys, I'm gonna...

4356
03:30:56,010 --> 03:30:57,450
Guys, I'm gonna...

4357
03:30:58,130 --> 03:31:04,170
I'm gonna put a censor bar in the editing.

4358
03:31:05,490 --> 03:31:07,390
To hide, you know...

4359
03:31:08,270 --> 03:31:12,070
The one second you were all here.

4360
03:31:13,070 --> 03:31:16,010
That was... Wow, that was...

4361
03:31:16,010 --> 03:31:18,210
That was an adventure.

4362
03:31:19,230 --> 03:31:22,390
And I learned a lot.

4363
03:31:23,530 --> 03:31:26,370
And I hope...

4364
03:31:27,110 --> 03:31:28,590
And I...

4365
03:31:29,150 --> 03:31:31,170
I hope... I hope...

4366
03:31:31,170 --> 03:31:33,990
I hope they let me hold hands.

4367
03:31:34,590 --> 03:31:36,870
I hope she lets me hold her hand again.

4368
03:31:47,030 --> 03:31:48,630
That was...

4369
03:31:48,630 --> 03:31:49,010
Wow.

4370
03:31:49,970 --> 03:31:50,290
Wow.

4371
03:31:50,290 --> 03:31:50,670
Wow.

4372
03:31:56,470 --> 03:31:58,090
It's part two.

4373
03:31:58,650 --> 03:32:00,550
Say thank you for the super chat.

4374
03:32:00,810 --> 03:32:02,050
Thank you, thank you.

4375
03:32:03,270 --> 03:32:03,910
Wow.

4376
03:32:05,090 --> 03:32:06,750
We were all here.

4377
03:32:06,930 --> 03:32:08,010
Alan, thank you for the super chat.

4378
03:32:08,090 --> 03:32:09,270
Thank you, thank you.

4379
03:32:10,710 --> 03:32:11,350
Wowie.

4380
03:32:13,790 --> 03:32:14,430
Alright.

4381
03:32:14,910 --> 03:32:17,110
I'm gonna head out now.

4382
03:32:17,650 --> 03:32:19,990
As always, everybody, stay hydrated.

4383
03:32:20,390 --> 03:32:22,490
Posture check, get up and move around to get that blood flow.

4384
03:32:22,590 --> 03:32:24,210
And if you stay up for me...

4385
03:32:24,210 --> 03:32:25,970
Wow, head to bed.

4386
03:32:26,150 --> 03:32:28,330
Cause you all deserve it.

4387
03:32:28,570 --> 03:32:30,110
I hope you guys enjoyed...

4388
03:32:30,910 --> 03:32:32,110
My adventures of...

4389
03:32:34,030 --> 03:32:34,510
Wow.

4390
03:32:37,870 --> 03:32:40,290
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

4391
03:32:41,270 --> 03:32:42,590
Bye bye, guys.

4392
03:32:42,850 --> 03:32:43,510
Bye bye.

4393
03:34:00,770 --> 03:34:01,430
Bye bye.
