145
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:47,040
Oh, guys, look at this.

00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:52,780
Because I can run mods.

149
00:16:55,900 --> 00:17:04,260

thing, where it actually disables flash.

176
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:54,260
Look, look, I'm, is it a bad time to tell you guys that I'm

Is it, is it a bad time to admit that I was never good at
bullying?

179
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:13,940
Bullying is a lot harder than expected.

180
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:17,700
Bullying is just, bullying is just as hard as our IRA.

181

Okay, this time.

182
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,560
There's no way.

183
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:24,920
At least let me hit one guy.

184
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,800

00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:31,920

00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:47,380
I swear to God.

191
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,260

Okay, we're gonna do stealth mode.

197
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,420
I might be able to stealth this.

198
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:05,350
Oh.

199
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:06,750
It's stealth.

200
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:08,790
It's almost stealth.

201
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,420
It's almost stealth.

202
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:26,360
I did it, guys.

203
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:29,200

not that we're too lazy to install mods is that we're not

208
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:49,920

I don't have to ask anybody.

212
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:05,040

277
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:24,340
You know what?

278
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,440

285
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:24,520
It went further.

286
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:28,240
It went further beyond.

287
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:30,200
Oh my god.

288
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:38,720
Did you guys hear that, like, they wanted to make a Batman
Beyond animated film in the same, from the same studios that

289
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,580
did the Spider-Verse movies?

290
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:43,180
And then Warner Brothers was like, no.

291
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:49,640
Like, they had, like, like, they drafted, like, storyboards
and everything.

292
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:57,880
And then Warner Brothers was like, no, yeah, I was looking
at the artwork for it.

293
00:24:58,140 --> 00:24:59,820
It looked so good.

294
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,820
That is so bad.

295
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:11,140
Oh, that's why there's wheelchairs everywhere.

296
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:13,800
Oh.

297
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:20,470
Okay, where is these fingerprints going this way?

298
00:25:22,370 --> 00:25:23,070
Yeah, Warner.

299
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:29,830
I mean, like, I'm honestly not surprised because Warner
Brothers has been like, you know shelving a lot of stuff

300
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:37,090
down so like are you guys really surprised though that this
side is shelving they've been like shelving a lot of

301
00:25:37,090 --> 00:25:46,010
projects in general so it's not like the first time i can
just you've done nothing but wine since we got busted out

302
00:25:46,010 --> 00:25:53,950
yeah joker sends his girlfriend down and tells us to guard
the tunnel joker tells us to kill the bat we kill the fat

303
00:25:57,010 --> 00:25:57,790
Did you do it?

304
00:25:57,930 --> 00:25:59,070
Did you do it?

305
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:04,730
Funny thing, he said the same to me.

306
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:06,710
I told him I ain't even have a sister.

307
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:08,630
He just kept telling me to do it.

308
00:26:09,010 --> 00:26:09,910
So I got in my car.

309
00:26:10,450 --> 00:26:11,630
What the fuck?

310
00:26:13,450 --> 00:26:15,650
Bro, you could have just killed a random girl.

311
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:18,530
Kind of a mystery, you know.

312
00:26:18,850 --> 00:26:24,990
I mean, don't get me wrong, but he acts all crazy one minute
and then the next, these old plans and jobs.

313
00:26:25,870 --> 00:26:26,990
Who knows what goes on here?

314
00:26:27,610 --> 00:26:30,650
Bro, that guy came just killed a random girl instead of his
sister.

315
00:26:30,770 --> 00:26:31,550
He doesn't care.

316
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:33,270
He just hates women, I guess.

317
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:37,190
Again.

318
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:39,310
There's one.

319
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:39,950
There's no way.

320
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:40,910
Come on.

321
00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:42,830
No!

322
00:26:42,930 --> 00:26:43,330
Fuck!

323
00:26:43,690 --> 00:26:44,650
Okay, I'm gonna go in.

324
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:45,590
Whoa!

325
00:26:46,150 --> 00:26:46,950
There's no way!

326
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:47,750
You!

327
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:48,910
No!

328
00:26:50,290 --> 00:26:51,090
Get me.

329
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:52,150
Get me out of here.

330
00:26:52,670 --> 00:26:52,890
Okay.

331
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:54,650
There you go.

332
00:26:54,730 --> 00:26:54,970
It's fine.

333
00:26:55,130 --> 00:26:55,350
It's fine.

334
00:26:55,870 --> 00:27:09,070
I just needed to get rid of guns oh god okay it's fine I
still remember how to dodge I just got rid of the guns okay

335
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:25,570
no gun ow it's okay I can reach it no how are you getting
guns again that's illegal picking up a gun from the floor

336
00:27:25,570 --> 00:27:32,430
that's so insane If I can't pick up a random gun on the
floor, you can't either.

337
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:35,390
Because they can pick up.

338
00:27:35,610 --> 00:27:39,010
No, if it touches the floor, it's like a five second rule.

339
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:41,330
And five seconds is already gone.

340
00:27:41,670 --> 00:27:48,170
So, like, what's the point of having a five second rule if
they can just pick up a gun after five seconds?

341
00:27:48,290 --> 00:27:49,190
Like, come on.

342
00:27:49,410 --> 00:27:50,350
That's not fair.

343
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:55,390
Like, the floor is like, exactly.

344
00:27:55,950 --> 00:27:56,990
All right, let me...

345
00:27:58,430 --> 00:28:08,650
Let me fucking tag this This wall real quick Boop They're
gonna need this Yeah, they don't want to get gun cooties

346
00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:11,710
That's how you get cooties

347
00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:19,990
Sweet, thank you for the super chat Thank you, thank you I
work too much But being here is more important Who need No,

very important important i still haven't fixed my sleep

349
00:28:28,850 --> 00:28:37,570
schedule it's been like two weeks i still haven't fixed it
guys remember to backseat me for the riddles i'm too stupid

350
00:28:37,570 --> 00:28:44,530
to solve this right now this is why bat you know what i
noticed i noticed that all of batman's robins have like

351
00:28:44,530 --> 00:28:48,370
black hair so like it's not random

352
00:28:54,310 --> 00:29:03,170
i've noticed it the kids he's adopting it's not random he's
got a type

353
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:21,160
whoa he's got a type yeah there was the red hair yeah but
like we who we don't really think about that person

354
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:40,700
he had in pre-crisis yes but then he died his because he
realized he wasn't he wasn't the favorite he realized he

355
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:51,940
wasn't he wasn't I'm having a conversation I'm so sorry whoa
where the fuck did I get shot at as I was saying he realized

356
00:29:51,940 --> 00:30:00,420
he realized that you know he wasn't getting the same
treatment as the other Robins I mean He was literally the

357
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:01,660
first one to die.

358
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:05,480
So, like, at this point, like, wow.

359
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:09,440
The robin that doesn't have black hair dies?

360
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:12,640
That's what a coincidence.

361
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:16,180
Yeah, it was so rude.

362
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:17,800
Where am I supposed to go?

363
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:20,140
I need to...

364
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:21,860
I already lost the trail.

365
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,220
I was in a lot looking at the trail.

366
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:27,860
Where is it?

367
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:28,820
Oh, shit.

368
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:30,440
Where's the DNA?

369
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:32,180
Oh, there it is.

370
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:33,760
Oh, there it is.

371
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:34,680
There's where it goes.

372
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:37,480
I'm so happy it doesn't have flashbang anymore.

373
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:39,660
I hated that shit so much.

374
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:42,740
This way.

375
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:44,740
Okay, there it is.

376
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:47,400
Oh, it has...

377
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:49,420
Oh, the structural weakness.

378
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:52,320
Does it really matter if I...

379
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:55,280
Oh, wait, I can collapse this structure.

380
00:31:03,050 --> 00:31:03,310
Alright.

381
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:03,910
Woo!

382
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:06,810
How do you not hear that?

383
00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:07,890
Oh, that doesn't matter.

384
00:31:08,050 --> 00:31:09,030
It was just lore.

385
00:31:09,730 --> 00:31:15,310
I returned to my work, but I could not shake the pictures
from my mind.

386
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:25,290
I should have been repulsed, but I was more eager than ever
to find an explanation for why someone would do this.

387
00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:28,770
Oh, okay.

388
00:31:31,570 --> 00:31:32,910
You know they don't have guns.

389
00:31:32,970 --> 00:31:33,890
I can just beat them up.

390
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:39,430
I actually wonder if the Joker actually provides insurance.

391
00:31:40,090 --> 00:31:42,210
Do you guys think the Joker would provide insurance?

392
00:31:45,010 --> 00:31:54,070
Because like, I feel like being a henchman is like, like
such a, like, it's like literally the only job I feel like.

393
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:55,230
No?

394
00:31:56,510 --> 00:31:58,330
He could be a good employer.

395
00:31:58,570 --> 00:31:59,710
You don't know that.

396
00:32:00,270 --> 00:32:02,190
Joe, not a chance.

397
00:32:02,430 --> 00:32:04,690
He could be a good employer.

398
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:09,250
Okay, let me get...

399
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:10,150
Oh, shit, no!

400
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:12,230
Okay, counter him.

401
00:32:13,010 --> 00:32:14,750
Gotta get this guy...

402
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:15,650
Get out.

403
00:32:15,890 --> 00:32:16,270
Get out.

404
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:17,330
Get out.

405
00:32:17,610 --> 00:32:19,030
Okay, get him out first.

406
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:22,510
Like, he pays his taxes.

407
00:32:23,890 --> 00:32:28,150
Okay, if he pays his taxes, he could be paying insurance.

408
00:32:28,550 --> 00:32:31,590
But to be fair, he does employ a lot of henchmen.

409
00:32:32,030 --> 00:32:34,190
So that is a lot of insurance.

410
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:36,930
Does he offer a 401k?

411
00:32:37,010 --> 00:32:37,490
Oh, yeah!

412
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:38,590
Wait, you're alive?

413
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:41,690
Oh, there...

414
00:32:41,690 --> 00:32:43,630
Oh, okay, he's just gonna jog off.

415
00:32:45,370 --> 00:32:47,430
Bro, I don't think that guy's alive, though.

416
00:32:47,670 --> 00:32:49,450
I don't think he's alive.

417
00:32:49,890 --> 00:32:51,890
Alright, which one do we upgrade, guys?

418
00:32:52,310 --> 00:33:01,030
Combo boost, combo batterang, HP, batteram power, twin
batterams, Sonic batterams.

419
00:33:03,130 --> 00:33:05,330
Okay, these are not available for upgrade.

420
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:17,550
great i don't think oh wait they are nice take down batter m
combo boost okay combo boost joker pace spikes potion neil

421
00:33:17,550 --> 00:33:22,350
thank you for the super chat thank you thank you i'll get
the combo boost

422
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:32,830
are you okay the guard wouldn't have lasted much longer is
he okay he struck his head when they knocked him to the

423
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:39,430
ground oh no away from here as soon as you can take him to
the medical It's the safest place on the island.

424
00:33:40,530 --> 00:33:47,150
I like being a henchman has to be like the most lucrative
job there is in Gotham City.

425
00:33:47,970 --> 00:33:49,610
Like there's so many henchmans.

426
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:52,450
Like there's so many mob bosses too.

427
00:33:53,210 --> 00:33:58,810
It's like, it's like the only job in Gotham City.

428
00:33:59,630 --> 00:34:00,890
Think about it.

429
00:34:01,190 --> 00:34:04,050
I just noticed it's literally like the only job.

430
00:34:04,170 --> 00:34:06,970
Like this entire town is controlled by the mob.

431
00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:10,350
And it's just like, I think the police is useless.

432
00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:14,630
Why be a cop when he can just be a fucking, like, underling?

433
00:34:19,650 --> 00:34:21,250
There's no reason to be...

434
00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:24,950
Why be paid, like, minimal wage as a cop when you can be...

435
00:34:24,950 --> 00:34:32,670
Why be paid, like, $11 for an hour for a cop when you be
paid, like, I don't know, like, a hundred bucks per hour

436
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:35,650
because you're always going on heist and everything.

437
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:36,510
Boop.

438
00:34:39,270 --> 00:34:50,150
nice i did that no don't grab the gun no i can't run no
don't pick up the gun no oh he's not picking up the gun he

00:34:50,150 --> 00:34:59,590

need He doesn't come back.

441
00:35:11,350 --> 00:35:12,570
Oh yeah, you think about it.

442
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:14,190
Batman is sort of like a furry.

443
00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:16,450
Because he's wearing a...

444
00:35:16,450 --> 00:35:18,970
He's wearing an outfit inspired by a bat.

445
00:35:24,610 --> 00:35:26,110
Why is the junk...

446
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:28,790
Junkling obsessed with man and bat?

447
00:35:28,990 --> 00:35:30,010
Is he a furry?

448
00:35:30,690 --> 00:35:31,210
Thank you.

449
00:35:31,510 --> 00:35:32,770
Thank you.

450
00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:34,110
Thank you.

451
00:35:34,110 --> 00:35:34,270
Thank you.

452
00:35:34,690 --> 00:35:35,970
Oh shit, my chat.

453
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:37,370
God, give me a sec.

454
00:35:37,890 --> 00:35:39,650
I need to reload my chat.

455
00:35:40,490 --> 00:35:41,870
He has bat ears.

456
00:35:42,110 --> 00:35:42,370
Yeah.

457
00:35:43,490 --> 00:35:45,230
And he likes Catwoman!

458
00:35:46,970 --> 00:35:48,630
Catwoman is definitely a furry.

459
00:35:49,050 --> 00:35:50,350
If you think about it.

460
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:54,190
$9 billion fursuit.

461
00:35:54,550 --> 00:35:56,510
No, but you don't understand!

462
00:35:57,450 --> 00:36:01,450
Like, fursuits actually are, like, a fucking so expensive.

463
00:36:01,590 --> 00:36:03,490
And he's a billionaire, too!

464
00:36:04,610 --> 00:36:05,770
It fits him.

465
00:36:06,010 --> 00:36:06,790
It fits him.

466
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:08,030
Alright.

467
00:36:08,890 --> 00:36:09,690
Where am I going?

468
00:36:10,530 --> 00:36:11,890
Oh, okay, that's locked.

469
00:36:12,310 --> 00:36:12,310
Okay.

470
00:36:12,490 --> 00:36:13,230
Wait, what's the riddle?

471
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:15,990
I don't remember what the riddle was in this area.

472
00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:17,270
Guys, where is the riddle?

473
00:36:19,050 --> 00:36:19,890
Where is the riddle?

474
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:30,460
I don't know what the riddle was.

475
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:35,800
I don't remember the riddle.

476
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:37,940
There's a tape?

477
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:39,900
Where's the tape?

478
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:46,820
Tape?

479
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:49,200
There's no tape here.

480
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:50,460
You fucking liars.

481
00:36:52,700 --> 00:37:01,440
where the fuck is the tape oh it's near the entrance okay
don't worry i won't miss the lore oh yeah do you know

482
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:11,800
there's lore on why he wears his underwear outside of his
suit i know they have lore for everything who's this

483
00:37:16,330 --> 00:37:19,910
okay but like 20 is like nothing in gotham at this rate

484
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:54,510
Anything that does matter is the mark.

485
00:37:55,370 --> 00:37:57,870
Have you seen my work, Miss Cassidy?

486
00:37:58,170 --> 00:37:59,450
What the fuck is this guy?

487
00:37:59,790 --> 00:38:02,530
This is actually a villain I don't know.

488
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:17,000
He's important enough to have, like, only voice file, but
I'm like, what the fuck is this guy?

489
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:27,600
Anyway, so the reason why Batman wears his underwear outside
of his, like, superhero suit is that it acts as, like, a

490
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,140
filtration device.

491
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:37,420
I don't remember if it was like gas or whatever, but like he
can use it to, he can take, so he can take his underwear off

492
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:41,440
very fast and use it as like a filtration thing.

493
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:52,900
Yeah, yeah, like to like, to like, you know, put it, put it
over his mouth to filter stuff.

494
00:38:53,400 --> 00:39:00,840
And I don't, it's obviously bullshit that they invented
later on, but like, that's like the current lore as to why,

495
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:03,520
that's the why he wears underwear.

496
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:12,720
Outside of his like suit it's obvious it's like they
invented it just for like as like a bullshit reason But

497
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:19,640
that's like the canon reason why he fucking wears his
underwear It's like a gas mask.

498
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:29,860
Yeah, it's like apparently a fucking like it's it's
apparently a gas mask All right, is there anybody here?

499
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,340
I want to be sure there's anybody here.

500
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:36,160
Okay Is there anything in here?

501
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:38,360
What's the sauce for this?

502
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,760
YouTube shorts is always YouTube shorts.

503
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:45,360
I thought, real soft.

504
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:48,280
How do you reflect on your successes and failures, Batman?

505
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:49,760
I don't.

506
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:51,140
If I don't think about it.

507
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:54,940
If I never think about it, then I'll never feel guilty.

508
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:59,800
Yeah, next time I'll be stuck in deadly gas, I'll use my
underwear.

509
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:00,420
Exactly!

510
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:01,840
We're all learning.

511
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:05,840
Hello.

512
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:10,480
Ooh, I don't like two people, one voice, no gun.

513
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:11,260
Two face?

514
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:12,760
Ow!

515
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:16,480
Wait, what's going on over there?

516
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:18,020
Is this a laughing gas?

517
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:20,440
What's going on?

518
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:24,260
What the fuck is going on?

519
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:26,960
What the fuck?

520
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:29,960
Is everything okay?

521
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:32,620
Is...

522
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:33,980
What the fuck is...

523
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:34,320
What?

524
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:37,540
What is going on?

525
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:41,520
Oh, this doesn't look too good.

526
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:43,620
Are they okay?

527
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:46,660
Wait, how did you die?

528
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:48,520
They're all locked up.

529
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:52,800
Return to monkey.

530
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:56,280
Holy shit, what's going on?

531
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:59,560
Okay, there's the electricity.

532
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:01,860
I wonder if there's like anything extra up top.

533
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:04,140
Is there anything, any loot?

534
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:12,300
I know there's like a party going downstairs, but loot
supplies can only be used only in a breakout attempt.

535
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:13,700
This is important.

536
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:15,500
This is the breakout attempt.

537
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:17,960
There might be stuff here.

538
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:19,140
Teeth!

539
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:20,460
Teeth!

540
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:21,840
Teeth!

541
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:22,880
Teeth!

542
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:24,420
Alright.

543
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:25,780
Nope.

544
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:27,580
Can't activate that yet.

545
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:28,580
Oh.

546
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,460

he is not he is not fit He's not Arkham Asylum Material.

555
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:53,200
This is why nobody remembers him.

556
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:55,940
20 people in like three months.

557
00:42:56,280 --> 00:43:02,880
Like, if I was allowed to kill, I'm pretty sure I've killed
like 100 today.

558
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:05,680
It's still...

559
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:12,320
The thing is, like, it might have been like one week since
we started playing this game.

560
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:19,020
But, like, all right now, like, for Batman, it's still,
like, maybe two hours have passed for Batman.

561
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:26,800
Batman and like if we're going by Batman time if I was
allowed to kill him in Batman I'm pretty sure I've killed a

562
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:31,860
hundred people in Batman within two hours in Arkham aside

563
00:43:37,070 --> 00:43:49,590
I'm just saying I'm so I just like who the fuck cares about
mr.

that's a ventricle request i know that was a timid orphan

566
00:44:10,650 --> 00:44:17,510

him being sent to a black gate prison there he encountered a

567
00:44:17,510 --> 00:44:25,810
puppet scarface and oh yeah he's like a mob bob son or
something and probably murdered inseparable with a scarface

568
00:44:25,810 --> 00:44:32,310
directing a series of criminal activities while most believe
that wesker is simply acting out a second personality

569
00:44:32,310 --> 00:44:38,710
through the puppet wesker sees himself as a reluctant lackey
who merely does his parents biddy what was this what's his

572
00:44:57,470 --> 00:44:58,030
This...

573
00:44:58,030 --> 00:44:58,210
Wait.

574
00:44:59,430 --> 00:45:02,010
We just have a mental health problem in Gotham City.

575
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:03,910
When Teen was...

576
00:45:03,910 --> 00:45:07,850
If we give the criminals, like, actually meds, do you think
they'll be better?

577
00:45:11,110 --> 00:45:11,670
Batman!

578
00:45:13,530 --> 00:45:18,010
You could have stopped on this if you improved the mental
health system!

579
00:45:18,630 --> 00:45:19,750
In Gotham City!

580
00:45:19,830 --> 00:45:21,870
Instead of running around in your underwear!

581
00:45:22,130 --> 00:45:24,230

00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:04,160
Really not interested in a bunch of flowers, Ivy.

588
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:06,220
They're in pain!

589
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:07,800
Cry for help!

590
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:08,860
Ooh!

591
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:10,640
Where are your babies?

592
00:46:11,020 --> 00:46:11,680
Just stay where you are.

593
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:13,720
Last thing I need is you running out.

594
00:46:14,140 --> 00:46:15,780
Just stay- How is she gonna get out?

595
00:46:16,780 --> 00:46:18,340
I'll save you.

596
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:21,200
Just stay where you are.

597
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:23,940
Like, she's- Where is she gonna go?

598
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:29,440
Botanus, Pamela, Isla.

599
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:34,540
was transformed by a science experiment gone wrong into a
plant-human hybrid.

600
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:40,460
When chlorophyll flowing through her veins instead of
bloods, she developed a toxic touch and a pheromone-fueled

601
00:46:40,460 --> 00:46:41,720
talent for seduction.

602
00:46:42,740 --> 00:46:50,020
Her crimes have become more ecologically focused as she has
increasingly abandoned her human side, identifying more with

603
00:46:50,020 --> 00:46:51,100
the natural world.

604
00:46:51,460 --> 00:46:57,620
Her unique brand of eco-terrorism often puts her in a
conflict with Batman, whose iron will usually protects him

605
00:46:57,620 --> 00:46:59,440
from her seductive powers.

606
00:46:59,460 --> 00:47:01,980
It's just not hot enough, I guess.

607
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:03,840
It's just not his type.

608
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:05,240
Five foot.

609
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:08,060
Wait, she's taller than the ventriloquist.

610
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:13,540
An ability to encourage and direct the growth of all plant
life.

611
00:47:14,020 --> 00:47:15,240
Plant G is mixed into her DNA.

612
00:47:15,460 --> 00:47:18,980
Makes her an unpredictable and formidable physical opponent.

613
00:47:19,580 --> 00:47:23,280
Exudes natural hormones that enable her to exert control
over victims.

614
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:27,380
Are you crying?

615
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:32,040
Wait, why is she wearing a shirt?

616
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:39,800
I mean, I meant that in a way where, like, her clothes are
her plants, you know?

617
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:44,440
Didn't mean that in any other way.

618
00:47:45,100 --> 00:47:49,240
Because, look, look, she's not wearing a red shirt here.

619
00:47:49,540 --> 00:47:50,160
She's...

620
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:58,340
I'm saying it because she's wearing a red shirt.

621
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:06,780
She's not wearing a shirt here like her clothes are plants
and that's not a plant It's not like in any it's not

622
00:48:06,780 --> 00:48:07,620
perverted way.

623
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:09,400
I'm not saying in a perverted way.

624
00:48:09,740 --> 00:48:16,120
I'm saying it as a lore way That's not a part of her.

625
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:16,860
It's red.

626
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:30,500
That's not a natural plant I'm just saying it's not it
doesn't fit lore According to the lore My shirt should be

627
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:31,280
green.

628
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:35,020
Alan, on the feeling said what everyone wanted.

629
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:36,760
Shake my head.

630
00:48:39,660 --> 00:48:41,240
They're all like little monkeys.

631
00:48:43,700 --> 00:48:44,540
Who's they?

632
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:46,660
Okay.

633
00:48:53,660 --> 00:48:56,240
A case of mistaken identity.

634
00:48:58,020 --> 00:48:58,240
What?

635
00:48:58,700 --> 00:48:59,040
Who?

636
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:03,510
Who is that?

637
00:49:03,690 --> 00:49:04,350
Is that guard?

638
00:49:04,630 --> 00:49:05,010
Wait, what are you?

639
00:49:05,010 --> 00:49:05,490
Is Quincy?

640
00:49:07,450 --> 00:49:08,390
Oh, Aaron?

641
00:49:08,710 --> 00:49:10,470
You need to get me out of this cell.

642
00:49:11,970 --> 00:49:12,370
It's me.

643
00:49:12,590 --> 00:49:13,110
Cash.

644
00:49:13,390 --> 00:49:14,650
I need it out there.

645
00:49:14,790 --> 00:49:15,630
I can help you.

646
00:49:18,170 --> 00:49:20,910
You've been, like, useless so far, though.

647
00:49:21,170 --> 00:49:22,630
Why would I need your help?

648
00:49:23,830 --> 00:49:23,930
Oh.

649
00:49:26,210 --> 00:49:26,730
Harley?

650
00:49:27,570 --> 00:49:28,090
Harley?

651
00:49:29,510 --> 00:49:30,510
You have to help me.

652
00:49:30,710 --> 00:49:31,110
Ivy?

653
00:49:31,470 --> 00:49:33,150
Gee, you look like crap.

654
00:49:33,410 --> 00:49:35,050
Maybe I can seek you some shampoo.

655
00:49:36,030 --> 00:49:37,090
Can't you hear them?

656
00:49:37,530 --> 00:49:39,750
They're crying out to me in agony.

657
00:49:39,750 --> 00:49:43,530
Yeah, well, I really don't have to come up to this Please
let me out.

658
00:49:43,850 --> 00:49:45,450
They'll die without me.

659
00:49:45,490 --> 00:49:46,710
I don't know red.

660
00:49:47,130 --> 00:49:47,890
You're not a mr.

661
00:49:48,030 --> 00:49:49,210

No Evie I Told you to stay in there.

665
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:11,000
Ivy, what the fuck?

666
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:16,440
Whoa.

667
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:23,840
They're just really good friends, guys.

668
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:30,660
Guys, they're just best friends.

669
00:50:33,260 --> 00:50:34,020
Ow.

670
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,740
No, I wanted to scat him.

671
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:38,980
Yeah, they're roommates.

672
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:42,000
No!

673
00:50:42,580 --> 00:50:45,520
I wanted to scan him for Clayface!

674
00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:51,180
Just gals being pals.

675

Alright, guess we'll rescue you.

676
00:50:59,220 --> 00:51:01,820
He's taken control of the security overrides.

677
00:51:02,420 --> 00:51:06,820
I have the sequence generator, but without the terminal in
my office, it's useless.

678
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:08,820
Your terminal has been destroyed.

679
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:10,160
Give me the sequencer.

680
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:10,620
What?

681
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:12,280
Oh, yes.

682
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:12,840
Of course.

683
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:18,300
It's like the Sailor Moon English dub where they're like,
they're just cousins.

684
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:23,320
Wow.

685
00:51:23,940 --> 00:51:26,900
They're so, such good cousins to each other.

686
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:31,460
Bro can use five one two bit decryption key.

687
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:33,680
Use ultrasound to bypass security systems.

688
00:51:33,780 --> 00:51:34,920
Oh my god, you finally do this.

689
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:36,620
There's always a way out.

690
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:49,260
always my fist will make the way out which one is it this
one okay yeah whoop i'll just shoot the problem oh never

691
00:51:49,260 --> 00:52:03,540
mind what what what am i doing what the fuck am i doing

692
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:08,380
Is that hacking?

693
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:11,000
Is this...

694
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,640
Oh, I make it green.

695
00:52:14,380 --> 00:52:16,060
Wait, oh, he changed.

696
00:52:18,940 --> 00:52:19,100
Clayface.

697
00:52:19,560 --> 00:52:20,800
I'm losing patience.

698
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:22,300
You're cheating.

699
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:26,420
Alright, initially an actor in horror films.

700
00:52:27,020 --> 00:52:33,960
Kylo went mad when he learned a classic film of his was to
be remade with different actor in the lead role.

701
00:52:34,380 --> 00:52:37,120
He took on the mask of the film's villain, Clayface.

702
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:42,000
and killed several of the remakes cast and crew before being
stopped by Batman and Robin.

703
00:52:42,700 --> 00:52:48,060
Later, Carlo joined a mud pack in the lines of
shape-changing mutated villains who had subsequently used

704
00:52:48,060 --> 00:52:49,060
the name Clayface.

705
00:52:49,420 --> 00:52:53,980
While the group was defeated, Carlo tricked his allies and
injected himself with the essences of several of them.

706
00:52:54,300 --> 00:52:59,560
Becoming a superhuman, imbued with the ability to change
shape, no, he just wants to be an actor.

707
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:03,840
That's all.

708
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:04,540
He doesn't want...

709
00:53:04,540 --> 00:53:06,440
Oh, he must be, like, really old, too.

710
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:08,300
Because he was...

711
00:53:08,300 --> 00:53:09,000
He got...

712
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:10,120
Oh,

713
00:53:13,620 --> 00:53:13,640
yeah.

714
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:14,740
Any fun facts?

715
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:16,140
Six push five.

716
00:53:17,340 --> 00:53:17,920
Professional criminal.

717
00:53:18,060 --> 00:53:19,480
It can alter his physical form.

718
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:21,120
Adopting appearance of nearly anyone.

719
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:22,120
His mouthful.

720
00:53:22,220 --> 00:53:23,640
His touch can be poisonous.

721
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:27,640
Get me out of here.

722
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:30,780
You rescued the wrong warden.

723
00:53:31,340 --> 00:53:32,200
He's an imposter.

724
00:53:33,100 --> 00:53:34,640
Wait, what is he doing with that doll?

725
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:37,240
Playface?

726
00:53:38,100 --> 00:53:38,660
Playface?

727
00:53:41,180 --> 00:53:45,960
Clayface, what are you doing with this little doll?

728
00:53:46,420 --> 00:53:48,420
I'm just curious, Clayface.

729
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:55,460
Whoa!

730
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:57,580
Again!

731
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:09,330
Is that it?

732
00:54:09,550 --> 00:54:11,390
I don't think he knows Commissioner Gordon.

733
00:54:15,770 --> 00:54:25,450
I don't think he knows like he I don't think he's like met
Commissioner Gordon he definitely hasn't really studied this

734
00:54:25,450 --> 00:54:45,070
role yet again again again oh no more magic tricks no more
the Commissioner who laughs he probably only saw him on TV.

735
00:54:45,390 --> 00:54:46,810
Yeah, he probably has.

736
00:54:47,430 --> 00:54:49,290
He doesn't know, like, what he actually does.

737
00:54:49,530 --> 00:54:50,810
Oh, riddle me this.

738
00:54:55,250 --> 00:54:55,830
You...

739
00:54:56,510 --> 00:54:57,090
Nice.

740
00:54:57,930 --> 00:54:58,990
Riddle me this.

741
00:55:01,950 --> 00:55:03,030
Fake fan.

742
00:55:03,530 --> 00:55:05,310
Wait, if I talk to him, will he...

743
00:55:06,010 --> 00:55:07,890
Will he change back?

744
00:55:09,390 --> 00:55:09,970
No.

745
00:55:10,430 --> 00:55:12,150
Aw, look, there's another wheelchair!

746
00:55:13,710 --> 00:55:20,190
Like, I'm pretty sure there's not a lot of people who are,
like, who need that wheelchair.

747
00:55:20,430 --> 00:55:24,350
I think it's just Joker trying to convince someone to do
stuff.

748
00:55:25,890 --> 00:55:27,570
I don't want to break the glass.

749
00:55:27,830 --> 00:55:29,310
What the fuck?

750
00:55:31,230 --> 00:55:32,030
Who's your arm?

751
00:55:34,350 --> 00:55:35,410
Who's your arm?

752
00:55:38,470 --> 00:55:39,670
Is it inside?

753
00:55:39,850 --> 00:55:40,990
I don't know what it is.

754
00:55:41,410 --> 00:55:42,350
Who are you?

755
00:55:42,450 --> 00:55:43,570

One punch.

772
00:57:13,630 --> 00:57:17,270
Like, I wish he did not have a single plan for this.

773
00:57:18,110 --> 00:57:20,510
He did not have a fucking plan.

774
00:57:21,290 --> 00:57:23,090
How do I do this?

775
00:57:25,730 --> 00:57:26,770
Or just hack this?

776
00:57:27,270 --> 00:57:28,230
Wait, can I hack this?

777
00:57:29,630 --> 00:57:30,150
No.

00:57:30,730 --> 00:57:31,030
Fuck.

00:57:31,370 --> 00:57:33,290
Wait, how the fuck do I get over there?

796
00:58:47,140 --> 00:58:47,520
Oh, shit!

797
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:48,320
He's grabbing a gun!

00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:50,200
Somebody stop him!

799
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:51,280

800
00:58:52,060 --> 00:58:52,620
There you go.

801
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:55,620

Just punch around on me!

00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:11,180
Eventually!

808
00:59:12,380 --> 00:59:14,040
Eventually it'll all hit you.

809
00:59:16,460 --> 00:59:17,040
Okay.

810
00:59:18,020 --> 00:59:20,020
I love buddy mashing.

811
00:59:20,260 --> 00:59:22,160
It's my favorite part about fighting games.

812
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:23,720
Okay.

813
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:24,560
Am I?

814
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:25,080
Am I doing it?

815
00:59:25,240 --> 00:59:25,680
Am I doing it?

816
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:26,840
Am I pressing Y and B?

817
00:59:27,100 --> 00:59:27,480
Am I...

818
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:32,060
Nice.

819
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:33,300
Last guy.

820
00:59:35,560 --> 00:59:36,020
Goodbye.

821
00:59:37,740 --> 00:59:39,180
I'm doing it.

822
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,100
Was that as easy as it looked?

823
00:59:46,180 --> 00:59:49,620
Well, it won't be so easy trying to catch me.

824
00:59:54,040 --> 00:59:59,500
I mean, if I actually shoot you, it'd be...

825
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:08,280
easier i feel like why wouldn't i tranquilize your guns like
what are my batman gear that's just not just fist and bat

826
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:17,120
around i feel like it'd be easier to have a tranquilizer and
i can just tranquilize villains because i can't kill but i

827
01:00:17,120 --> 01:00:28,340
can like put them to sleep if i put them in a coma does that
count as killing thank you for the super chat thank you

828
01:00:28,340 --> 01:00:34,620
thank you it's 11 p.m i have nothing planned tomorrow but

01:00:53,360 --> 01:00:55,060

832
01:00:58,840 --> 01:01:01,380
This roll fucking sucks!

833
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:07,360
Because, like, putting them in a vegetable state is almost
practically the same thing!

834
01:01:10,680 --> 01:01:12,360
Oh, wait, let me hack this.

835
01:01:13,060 --> 01:01:13,420

Yeah, but technically I'm sort of doing it already!

837
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:20,860
I can't even think about it!

838
01:01:25,600 --> 01:01:26,840
And then...

wouldn't be hacking because i made it okay i'm a little lost

841
01:01:49,260 --> 01:01:51,600
putting them in the vegetable state like

This is not power, guys.

856
01:03:23,420 --> 01:03:24,480
Can I hack this?

857
01:03:24,620 --> 01:03:24,920
No.

858
01:03:28,850 --> 01:03:30,790
What the fuck do I need to go?

859
01:03:31,990 --> 01:03:33,950
The door is locked.

860
01:03:35,830 --> 01:03:37,310
I'm chasing Harley.

861
01:03:37,430 --> 01:03:38,850
Yeah, but the doors are locked.

862
01:03:39,050 --> 01:03:40,050
I hacked everything.

863
01:03:41,730 --> 01:03:42,370
I think?

864
01:03:44,430 --> 01:03:47,350
I forgot where she ran to.

865
01:03:52,430 --> 01:03:54,310
I flew up a wall?

866
01:03:55,390 --> 01:03:59,490
I'm just like, when did I do that?

867
01:03:59,790 --> 01:04:01,090
I'm so confused.

868
01:04:08,140 --> 01:04:10,560
Where I got the last trophy.

869
01:04:12,980 --> 01:04:14,480
I'm so lost.

870
01:04:14,900 --> 01:04:16,360
This is why I need a robin.

871
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:17,440
Robins!

872
01:04:17,560 --> 01:04:18,740
Where are you?

873
01:04:19,880 --> 01:04:22,060
Go straight to the side.

874
01:04:22,460 --> 01:04:23,100
This one?

875
01:04:25,720 --> 01:04:27,540
Where are my robins?

876
01:04:27,720 --> 01:04:28,760
Oh wait, this way.

877
01:04:30,320 --> 01:04:31,260
That's me here.

878
01:04:38,890 --> 01:04:42,290
Prometheus Arkham God's most wanted and most hated...

879
01:04:42,310 --> 01:04:47,390
Wait, there's someone more hated than fucking Batman than
Batman and Joker?

880
01:04:50,250 --> 01:04:50,890
No way.

881
01:04:51,450 --> 01:04:52,810
Oh, let me do this.

882
01:04:54,910 --> 01:04:55,950
Try using your...

883
01:04:55,950 --> 01:04:56,390
No!

884
01:04:58,930 --> 01:05:01,570
I'll need eyes when I have chat.

885
01:05:14,170 --> 01:05:15,450
Who's my favorite, Robin?

886
01:05:19,180 --> 01:05:20,320
What if I just let them die?

887
01:05:31,540 --> 01:05:32,740
I didn't kill him.

888
01:05:32,840 --> 01:05:33,700
Gravity killed him.

889
01:05:33,880 --> 01:05:35,880
Oh, I have to save...

890
01:05:43,100 --> 01:05:46,160
Why do I have to save them?

891
01:05:47,040 --> 01:05:52,920
Oh, yeah, those two guards are the most important guards,
and I can just hire new ones.

892
01:05:54,280 --> 01:05:56,580
Like, there's so many guards I've died already.

893
01:05:56,720 --> 01:05:59,700
Like, at this point, it's just I don't really care anymore.

894
01:06:00,100 --> 01:06:01,740
I just finally turned up.

895
01:06:09,820 --> 01:06:10,400
Oh, yes.

896
01:06:10,540 --> 01:06:11,000
Okay.

897
01:06:14,460 --> 01:06:16,280
Okay, you do your exposition.

898
01:06:16,460 --> 01:06:17,440
I'm going to do this.

899
01:06:21,300 --> 01:06:23,100
Oh, it's not my fault.

900
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:25,800
Wait, what?

901
01:06:34,090 --> 01:06:35,810
Wait, where's the other one?

902
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:42,340
Oh, no.

903
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:43,960
Oh, no, I don't do it.

904
01:06:43,980 --> 01:06:44,740
Oh, they pressure!

905
01:06:48,180 --> 01:06:48,840
That's okay.

906
01:06:50,120 --> 01:06:51,120
No, it's not okay!

907
01:06:51,320 --> 01:06:51,660
No!

908
01:06:54,000 --> 01:07:04,520
I thought I could I thought I could do it I thought I could
just do it before it comes back up okay I'll let her do her

909
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:20,180

01:07:33,180 --> 01:07:34,480
Oh, hacked.

912
01:07:39,100 --> 01:07:39,680
No!

913
01:07:41,980 --> 01:07:43,620
I don't like pressure!

914
01:07:47,740 --> 01:07:47,740
Please.

915
01:07:48,820 --> 01:07:48,820
Please.

916
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:51,220
Where can I get me one of those?

917
01:07:51,420 --> 01:07:51,740
Please.

918
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:52,640
Please!

919
01:07:56,760 --> 01:07:58,060
Don't try to back up!

920
01:07:58,160 --> 01:07:58,440
Please!

921
01:07:58,540 --> 01:07:59,920
I'm so stuck in the cutscene!

922
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:04,260
There you go.

923
01:08:05,160 --> 01:08:05,640

Oh shit.

928
01:08:35,310 --> 01:08:41,150
All right, 11 seconds I can do this Why do you have to take
so long to bring out your fucking hacking thing?

929
01:08:41,790 --> 01:08:45,310

01:09:18,310 --> 01:09:19,690
Can I go back inside?

934
01:09:23,010 --> 01:09:24,010
Oh wait, that's not the inside.

935
01:09:24,210 --> 01:09:24,870
It was this way.

936
01:09:28,520 --> 01:09:29,780
Is it locked forever?

937
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:31,920
No, it's locked forever!

938
01:09:34,020 --> 01:09:35,460
Wait, where do I go?

939
01:09:37,240 --> 01:09:39,280
This really... where do I go?

940
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:42,600
Just like, where?

941
01:09:43,760 --> 01:09:44,320
Here?

942
01:09:44,780 --> 01:09:45,840
Oh, there's a hack.

943
01:09:47,080 --> 01:09:48,180
Must be a hack here too.

944
01:09:52,280 --> 01:09:54,360
Alright, this way.

945
01:09:54,880 --> 01:09:55,140
Oh.

946
01:09:56,220 --> 01:09:57,840
It's not... Oh, there we go.

947
01:09:58,400 --> 01:09:58,840
Yay!

948
01:10:04,220 --> 01:10:05,660
This may take a while.

949
01:10:06,040 --> 01:10:07,160
The systems lock me out.

950
01:10:07,440 --> 01:10:08,160
Oh, shit.

951
01:10:08,280 --> 01:10:10,060
This is the the gas chamber.

952
01:10:10,980 --> 01:10:13,540
Wait, it was a real gas chamber this entire time.

953
01:10:13,860 --> 01:10:15,220
Hey, welcome to the tomato farm!

954
01:10:15,480 --> 01:10:16,040
Welcome, welcome!

955
01:10:18,440 --> 01:10:18,940
Okay.

956
01:10:19,080 --> 01:10:20,240
Oh wait, I can go up.

957
01:10:23,080 --> 01:10:23,580
Nice.

958
01:10:24,920 --> 01:10:26,500
What do I do up here, though?

959
01:10:27,860 --> 01:10:30,640
I can go up, but what's the point?

960
01:10:31,740 --> 01:10:32,760
Really, let me do this!

961
01:10:34,200 --> 01:10:35,660
Okay, I need to blow this up.

962
01:10:38,920 --> 01:10:39,960
There you go.

963
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:45,140
Surely nothing bad's going to happen.

964
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:47,320
I'm underwear.

965
01:10:50,600 --> 01:10:51,320
Yeah, see?

966
01:10:51,860 --> 01:10:53,300
Oh, no, that's still the gas.

967
01:10:56,100 --> 01:10:57,220
Wait, but where's the question?

968
01:10:57,240 --> 01:11:18,260
question mark how do I do this no no it's so far I can't
turn the fan off come back later that's code for I'm never

969
01:11:18,260 --> 01:11:25,380

970
01:11:30,780 --> 01:11:31,780
Let's see.

971
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:33,300
I guess we go back here.

972
01:11:40,600 --> 01:11:43,840
Room is the end of days for even the most celebrated killer.

973
01:11:44,080 --> 01:11:44,640
What's that mean?

974
01:11:45,400 --> 01:11:46,700
Bro, I'm on detective mode.

975
01:11:47,640 --> 01:11:49,060
Can I get canceled for beating up?

976
01:11:50,560 --> 01:11:51,880
For beating him up?

977
01:11:56,500 --> 01:11:57,680
God damn it, Batman!

978
01:11:58,600 --> 01:11:59,680
This is not good!

979
01:12:01,640 --> 01:12:03,420
They need medical help!

980
01:12:06,300 --> 01:12:07,680
Wait, who's that over there?

981
01:12:07,700 --> 01:12:08,760
come on

982
01:12:13,390 --> 01:12:28,570
oh no he's dead more teeth teeth teeth teeth is important i

983
01:12:32,730 --> 01:12:43,770
oh who has four walls two sides and one x dna i actually
don't know who that is all right who that did i already do

984
01:12:43,770 --> 01:12:45,070
this i already did this hack.

985
01:12:46,270 --> 01:12:48,670
I'll get over there so I can beat him up.

986
01:12:50,250 --> 01:12:51,090
Is that Two-Face?

987
01:12:53,190 --> 01:12:54,170
Oh, where Two-Face?

988
01:12:55,950 --> 01:12:56,870
Security guard.

989
01:12:57,070 --> 01:12:58,810
Oh, where do I get this out?

990
01:13:00,310 --> 01:13:00,770
Wall.

991
01:13:01,850 --> 01:13:02,310
Oh.

992
01:13:02,310 --> 01:13:03,930
Wall Mountain and Heldwood.

993
01:13:04,070 --> 01:13:05,590
Okay, I can't do that, obviously.

994
01:13:06,190 --> 01:13:07,570
I'm so confused.

995
01:13:11,420 --> 01:13:13,300
Look for his old cell.

996
01:13:14,720 --> 01:13:15,220
Oh, dead!

997
01:13:15,340 --> 01:13:15,720
There it is!

998
01:13:17,900 --> 01:13:19,060
That's his cell.

999
01:13:21,980 --> 01:13:26,280
District Attorney Harvey Dent was one of the Batman's
strongest allies in Gotham City.

1000
01:13:27,220 --> 01:13:31,200
Until the criminal threw acid in Dent's face, hitlessly
scarring him.

1001
01:13:31,540 --> 01:13:37,480
The wounds fractured his psyche and he was born as a
schizoid criminal mastermind, obsessed with duality.

1002
01:13:37,900 --> 01:13:43,600
His former good luck charm, a two-headed trick silver
dollar, was damaged on one side in attack, and Den has

1003
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:46,840
seized on it as a reflection of his half-scarred visage.

1004
01:13:47,440 --> 01:13:50,800
On it as a reflection, he flips it to decide the fate of his
victims.

1005
01:13:51,240 --> 01:13:58,580
Despite Batman's effort to reform his former ally, Den is
consumed by his fixation on chance, and his crimes are

1006
01:13:58,580 --> 01:14:03,060
designated to design to prove out his diametric philosophy.

1007
01:14:07,740 --> 01:14:09,260
All right, how tall is he, though?

1008
01:14:13,120 --> 01:14:15,240
The most important question.

1009
01:14:15,700 --> 01:14:17,060
How tall is he?

1010
01:14:18,220 --> 01:14:22,340
He loosely scarred on the left side, which he plays out with
clothing, that's definitely solid on one.

1011
01:14:22,540 --> 01:14:25,520
It's not like, oh, I thought it was like a fun fact, but
it's just an attribute.

1012
01:14:31,510 --> 01:14:33,690
The question, how tall is he?

1013
01:14:34,390 --> 01:14:35,130
Where'd I go?

1014
01:14:37,470 --> 01:14:38,970
I'll always be lost.

1015
01:14:44,850 --> 01:14:47,510
I'll never, ever figure out where to go.

1016
01:14:50,630 --> 01:14:51,970
Let's stay here.

1017
01:14:54,870 --> 01:14:55,230
Clock gate.

1018
01:14:55,910 --> 01:14:56,990
Oh, my clock!

1019
01:14:58,110 --> 01:14:59,090
I've so many...

1020
01:14:59,090 --> 01:15:01,010
God, the Batman has so many gadgets.

1021
01:15:01,290 --> 01:15:01,790
I forgot.

1022
01:15:02,390 --> 01:15:03,290
I forgot.

1023
01:15:05,750 --> 01:15:07,370
Bro, I never used this.

1024
01:15:08,870 --> 01:15:10,170
Oh, my God.

1025
01:15:10,290 --> 01:15:11,050
His other...

1026
01:15:11,050 --> 01:15:12,290
His useful tool.

1027
01:15:12,910 --> 01:15:13,310
Wow!

1028
01:15:14,270 --> 01:15:14,670
Where did...

1029
01:15:14,670 --> 01:15:16,070
How did you get over here?

1030
01:15:17,230 --> 01:15:18,550
What the fuck?

1031
01:15:18,750 --> 01:15:18,950
Please.

1032
01:15:18,970 --> 01:15:28,550
don't cancel me he it was self-defense it's him again for
the record the patient has transferred

1033

01:16:00,010 --> 01:16:02,350

1037
01:16:19,040 --> 01:16:24,560

sends people to arkham asylum knowing that they look safe

1038
01:16:24,560 --> 01:16:30,260
just so he could be i think he has anger issues i think like
he just wants to beat up his problem instead of actually

1039
01:16:30,260 --> 01:16:38,620
rehabilitating like investing in like proper mental care to
these people like majority of the criminals here are just

1040
01:16:38,620 --> 01:16:48,500
like mentally unwell like i'm like there's literally like
six nurses like six nurses in the entire arkham asylum and

1041
01:16:48,500 --> 01:16:58,580
like i feel like you know maybe they have more nurses you
know maybe if arkham asylum a asylum a mental hospital

1042
01:16:58,580 --> 01:17:06,200
assigned more medical professionals things would be a little
better instead of six nurses

1043
01:17:14,320 --> 01:17:25,940
about it like that's the biggest issue i have on batman so
i'm like lagging by like crazy for some reason i'm like like

with gotham gotham in general just has is not really the

1047
01:18:15,340 --> 01:18:27,540

many billionaires maybe gotham is like texas in a way that

1048
01:18:27,540 --> 01:18:38,700
like taxes are like um the tax it's like it's like the taxes
are really like barely existent in in gotham so like all the

1060
01:20:28,240 --> 01:20:30,820
Doki, who's going to become good at payroll?

1061
01:20:30,940 --> 01:20:31,480
Please help me.

1062
01:20:31,600 --> 01:20:32,720
My family keeps losing.

1063
01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:34,040
Boy, assassin.

1064
01:20:38,140 --> 01:20:45,020
I mean, Batman is willing to just throw away, like, his
fucking car so easily.

1065
01:20:46,020 --> 01:20:49,980
And that car is, like, I would not be surprised if it's,
like, $100 million.

1066
01:20:51,180 --> 01:20:55,300
I would not be surprised at a hundred million dollar car
right there.

1067
01:20:55,580 --> 01:20:56,620
He doesn't care!

1068
01:20:58,160 --> 01:21:00,020
Hey, we're gonna need this.

1069
01:21:00,560 --> 01:21:02,720
Stop buying bat team...

1070
01:21:02,720 --> 01:21:03,260
No.

1071
01:21:05,200 --> 01:21:07,720
They're not even great gadgets, too.

1072
01:21:14,110 --> 01:21:14,570
Oh, yeah.

1073
01:21:14,650 --> 01:21:15,750
I didn't see the hack here.

1074
01:21:23,580 --> 01:21:23,940
Yeah.

1075
01:21:28,370 --> 01:21:35,250
I hate the argument of, like, how much prep time does Batman
have would be like, who's going to win?

1076
01:21:35,350 --> 01:21:38,610
Batman versus X, and then people would be like, how much
prep time does he get?

1077
01:21:38,830 --> 01:21:40,730
Well, sometimes people don't get prep time.

1078
01:21:41,750 --> 01:21:46,650
Majority of time, people will never get prep time if you
think about it.

1079
01:21:50,750 --> 01:21:54,230
Usually, when something happens, it sometimes comes by a
surprise.

1080
01:21:54,870 --> 01:21:56,570
Why are we giving him prep time?

1081
01:21:58,530 --> 01:21:58,970
...

1082
01:22:05,450 --> 01:22:08,110
A good villain would never give you prep time.

1083
01:22:08,270 --> 01:22:10,130
It's always a surprise.

1084
01:22:17,830 --> 01:22:18,350
Excellent.

1085
01:22:19,650 --> 01:22:21,170
I'll leave it to you then, my dear.

1086
01:22:22,230 --> 01:22:23,210
Get him!

1087
01:22:28,360 --> 01:22:28,600
Where?

1088
01:22:29,140 --> 01:22:29,820
Oh, there.

1089
01:22:30,780 --> 01:22:31,080
Alright.

1090
01:22:31,720 --> 01:22:32,640
Give me a sec.

1091
01:22:34,020 --> 01:22:35,740
Let me beat up some people real quick.

1092
01:22:37,480 --> 01:22:39,260
Let me beat up some people real quick.

1093
01:22:39,460 --> 01:22:39,940
Ooh, nice.

1094
01:22:40,500 --> 01:22:41,500
That's fucking right.

1095
01:22:41,640 --> 01:22:42,240
Get down.

1096
01:22:42,620 --> 01:22:43,480
Oh, shit!

1097
01:22:44,220 --> 01:22:44,820
Electricity!

1098
01:22:45,560 --> 01:22:46,100

1099
01:22:50,460 --> 01:22:52,380
My floor is lava!

1100
01:22:54,940 --> 01:22:55,960

01:23:00,720 --> 01:23:01,380
We're fine here.

1104
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:02,680
It's not this floor.

1105
01:23:07,220 --> 01:23:07,920

You're just gonna do that to party like that?

1134
01:26:27,230 --> 01:26:27,710
No!

1135
01:26:27,990 --> 01:26:29,070
It's okay, she has Ivy.

1136
01:26:29,570 --> 01:26:31,490
Her best friend and roommate.

1137
01:26:42,380 --> 01:26:44,720
We've been easy with prep time.

1138
01:26:50,070 --> 01:26:51,250
Wait, who's that?

1139
01:26:51,270 --> 01:26:52,750
Why the smiles next to certain names?

1140
01:26:52,870 --> 01:26:53,130
Yeah.

1141
01:26:53,410 --> 01:26:55,330
You're the detective, you tell me.

1142
01:26:57,030 --> 01:26:58,170
backseat me, Harley.

1143
01:26:59,770 --> 01:27:02,250
Just punch her in the head like all the other ones.

1144
01:27:02,970 --> 01:27:03,490
What?

1145
01:27:06,210 --> 01:27:07,550
You won't hit a woman?

1146
01:27:08,710 --> 01:27:12,010
She killed more people than the Joker goons.

1147
01:27:12,130 --> 01:27:16,510
He's in the secret lab in the gardens and, oh crap.

1148
01:27:16,750 --> 01:27:17,810
Yep, I know.

1149
01:27:17,950 --> 01:27:20,110
She literally killed more than the other guys.

1150
01:27:28,760 --> 01:27:29,800
What the fuck?

1151
01:27:30,040 --> 01:27:31,200
This should be equality!

1152
01:27:32,260 --> 01:27:33,540
Oracle, I'm done.

1153
01:27:34,720 --> 01:27:35,760
Harley is...

1154
01:27:35,760 --> 01:27:37,500
Oh, she's quiet.

1155
01:27:38,680 --> 01:27:40,680
So you can find the secret lab in the gardens.

1156
01:27:41,340 --> 01:27:41,600
Yes.

1157
01:27:42,360 --> 01:27:43,980
Harley's been everywhere on the island.

1158
01:27:44,460 --> 01:27:47,840
So I'm calibrating the scanner to only show prints that have
traces of chlorophyll.

1159
01:27:48,260 --> 01:27:48,680
Okay, listen.

1160
01:27:49,080 --> 01:27:49,440
Be careful.

1161
01:27:50,020 --> 01:27:50,880
I rerouted away.

1162
01:27:50,900 --> 01:27:53,700
I can fix her, but she's high.

1163
01:27:54,520 --> 01:27:54,540
...

1164
01:27:54,540 --> 01:27:54,820

obsessively um searching for a way to cure her the

1178
01:30:33,930 --> 01:30:40,250
corporation that funded his research and norah's life pulled
the plug triggering an accident that transformed fry's body

1179
01:30:40,250 --> 01:30:49,510
into a uh into a cold blooded form that must always be kept
below zero at normal room temperature he will die willing a

1180
01:30:49,510 --> 01:30:56,470
number of freezing weapons he wears protective armor and his
quest to somehow bring back his lovely wife and avenge her

01:31:45,710 --> 01:31:46,490
Oh, nice.

1192
01:31:46,790 --> 01:31:48,910
We're... Jesus Christ, that's a lot of bodies.

1193
01:31:50,970 --> 01:31:51,410
That's...

1194
01:31:51,410 --> 01:31:52,730
Ice to meet you.

1195
01:31:53,130 --> 01:31:54,950
Thank you for the super chapter, Maynator.

1196
01:31:55,130 --> 01:31:55,510
Thank you.

1197
01:31:55,770 --> 01:31:56,130
Thank you.

1198
01:31:58,210 --> 01:31:58,650
Alright.

1199
01:31:58,930 --> 01:31:59,730
Is there anything over here?

1200
01:32:03,120 --> 01:32:04,240
Oh, wait, this should be.

1201
01:32:04,260 --> 01:32:05,560
Yeah, there should be a video.

1202
01:32:08,260 --> 01:32:09,420
What is he

1203
01:32:23,070 --> 01:32:25,610
saying?

1204
01:32:26,730 --> 01:32:27,450
Oh, shit!

1205
01:32:37,590 --> 01:32:40,090
How the fuck is he stronger than the guard?

1206
01:32:41,370 --> 01:32:44,290
I would assume the guards are more trained than him.

1207
01:32:44,490 --> 01:32:45,750
He's literally in asylum.

1208
01:32:46,050 --> 01:32:46,890
There's no way.

1209
01:32:47,410 --> 01:32:51,090
There's no way he's getting the proteins necessary to keep
up his muscle.

1210
01:32:53,870 --> 01:32:54,430
Poor bitch.

1211
01:32:54,450 --> 01:32:56,070
Poor me.

1212
01:32:57,810 --> 01:33:00,850
Hiring these god-awful guards.

1213
01:33:02,910 --> 01:33:04,090
Alright, hacking time.

1214
01:33:04,230 --> 01:33:04,690
Wait, what?

1215
01:33:05,530 --> 01:33:06,170
Can I hack?

1216
01:33:07,690 --> 01:33:08,570
Currently inactive.

1217
01:33:08,710 --> 01:33:09,310
Oh, they're all inactive.

1218
01:33:09,350 --> 01:33:09,630
Oh, wait, no.

1219
01:33:09,690 --> 01:33:10,650
Except for this one.

1220
01:33:16,060 --> 01:33:17,760
I guess it's sort of like prison.

1221
01:33:18,080 --> 01:33:20,360
I mean, it is prison where they like train up.

1222
01:33:20,500 --> 01:33:22,180
All they do is fucking it.

1223
01:33:23,380 --> 01:33:28,100
All they do is fucking get buffed as fuck in prison and
lifting weights and stuff.

1224
01:33:29,280 --> 01:33:39,020
I feel like If yours are I feel like if I was like the
warden of Arkham Asylum I would not buy any train Like I

1225
01:33:39,020 --> 01:33:46,660
would not buy a gym Like why the fuck would I give prisoners
time to train and get buff

1226
01:33:49,840 --> 01:34:02,760
No I'm so stow wow Never mind I got trapped by ridders this
is why you should not be a completionist

1227
01:34:08,710 --> 01:34:20,550
nice they brought the animal before me shameless and barking
like a mad dog for what felt like days i endured his boasts

1228
01:34:20,550 --> 01:34:31,090
he took pleasure recounting his actions cataloging his
depraved crimes what should have been revenge turned to pity

1229
01:34:31,090 --> 01:34:54,190
this poor dog needed my help oh wait how do i get up oh wait

1234
01:35:39,400 --> 01:35:41,120
Track Harley's fingerprints.

1235
01:35:41,820 --> 01:35:41,820
Where?

1236
01:35:42,780 --> 01:35:44,600
Where is her fingerprints?

1237
01:35:45,740 --> 01:35:45,960
Do I?

1238
01:35:46,980 --> 01:35:48,040
Do I go back?

1239
01:35:48,820 --> 01:35:49,660
Oh, wait, is that door?

1240
01:35:49,800 --> 01:35:50,380
That's a door!

1241
01:35:51,680 --> 01:35:52,260
Wait, no.

1242
01:35:53,540 --> 01:35:54,260
No, wait.

1243
01:35:54,900 --> 01:35:55,160
Wait.

1244
01:35:56,920 --> 01:35:57,840
Oh, no.

1245
01:35:58,380 --> 01:35:58,960
Oh.

1246
01:36:00,580 --> 01:36:01,720
Do I go backwards?

1247
01:36:03,120 --> 01:36:04,100
I must go backwards.

1248
01:36:04,260 --> 01:36:05,460
There's nowhere else to go.

1249
01:36:08,100 --> 01:36:09,280
What did you touch, Harley?

1250
01:36:09,860 --> 01:36:10,980
Oh, yeah, it's backwards.

1251
01:36:12,360 --> 01:36:13,120
It's backwards.

1252
01:36:13,480 --> 01:36:14,520
Okay, that Arkhamad.

1253
01:36:14,660 --> 01:36:15,300
Okay, I got it.

1254
01:36:15,320 --> 01:36:16,060
I figured it out.

1255
01:36:17,560 --> 01:36:18,480
I figured it out.

1256
01:36:19,160 --> 01:36:19,740
It's up here.

1257
01:36:20,160 --> 01:36:21,440
We're always lost.

1258
01:36:22,300 --> 01:36:23,900
That's my secret, Chad.

1259
01:36:24,140 --> 01:36:25,720
We're always lost.

1260
01:36:27,260 --> 01:36:28,080
Alright, this way.

1261
01:36:29,520 --> 01:36:30,060
This way.

1262
01:36:30,300 --> 01:36:30,500
Oh.

1263
01:36:30,580 --> 01:36:33,460
God, I was not- I did not realize that was a gift.

1264
01:36:50,520 --> 01:36:56,010
I guess you don't have to pay them, too.

1265
01:36:56,310 --> 01:36:58,250
Because they'll be too stupid to want money.

1266
01:36:59,030 --> 01:37:00,890
If you, like, expose them to the chemicals.

1267
01:37:01,950 --> 01:37:02,370
smart.

1268
01:37:02,710 --> 01:37:03,390
What do you think about?

1269
01:37:03,450 --> 01:37:04,290
There's so many riddles.

1270
01:37:04,990 --> 01:37:06,930
I'm just going to pretend I didn't see it.

1271
01:37:08,650 --> 01:37:08,950
Oh!

1272
01:37:10,010 --> 01:37:11,890
That's, this is Calendar Man still.

1273
01:37:11,990 --> 01:37:12,910
Where's Calendar Man?

1274
01:37:14,050 --> 01:37:14,530
Look at that.

1275
01:37:14,570 --> 01:37:15,310
See guys?

1276
01:37:15,650 --> 01:37:16,670
I'm not that stupid.

1277
01:37:17,670 --> 01:37:19,990
I recognize this riddle for Calendar Man.

1278
01:37:22,510 --> 01:37:22,990
Okay.

1279
01:37:23,490 --> 01:37:27,070
No, Joker apparently pays really well because he doesn't do
shit for money.

1280
01:37:29,210 --> 01:37:37,270
Like, he does this for, like, he doesn't care about money so
he actually pays really really well because he doesn't care

1281
01:37:37,270 --> 01:37:47,090
about the money that he gets from the heist all he does he
cares about is mayhem so he gives away all the money uh to

1282
01:37:47,090 --> 01:37:54,590
his yeah it's about the message so he pays he's actually a
really nice boss when it comes to the money not the other

1283
01:37:54,590 --> 01:37:55,390
stuff though

1284
01:38:01,950 --> 01:38:07,750
like oh there it is this has to hey guys where you guys
think is calendars man sell do you think it's the one filter

1285
01:38:07,750 --> 01:38:09,370
of calendars uh

1286
01:38:15,770 --> 01:38:27,870
calendar man god that outfit is so stupid fixated on the
calendar julian day became calendar man a villain who tied

1287
01:38:27,870 --> 01:38:33,590
and tied his crimes met thematically to certain holidays
throughout the year often leaving clues by which he could be

1288
01:38:33,590 --> 01:38:33,890
caught.

1289
01:38:34,470 --> 01:38:40,610
Gotham City's hopes for a day off are often clouded by a
knowledge that any holiday of note is likely to be shadowed

1290
01:38:40,610 --> 01:38:42,150
by calendar man's presence.

1291
01:38:42,470 --> 01:38:45,430
Then like, don't release him on holidays.

1292
01:38:46,710 --> 01:38:48,990
On holidays, you put him on house arrest.

1293
01:38:49,690 --> 01:38:51,090
Because he has a pattern.

1294
01:38:52,790 --> 01:38:53,310
Gotham!

1295
01:38:56,590 --> 01:38:59,410
Just put him on house arrest on holidays!

1296
01:39:03,770 --> 01:39:05,710
Don't have a holiday in Goth...

1297
01:39:05,710 --> 01:39:06,250
You know what?

1298
01:39:06,350 --> 01:39:08,410
Just don't have a holiday in Gotham City.

1299
01:39:11,670 --> 01:39:13,310
He escapes, obviously.

1300
01:39:13,690 --> 01:39:15,670
Well, cap him on 24 hours.

1301
01:39:15,870 --> 01:39:17,850
There's not enough holidays in the world.

1302
01:39:18,330 --> 01:39:20,050
Guys, there's...

1303
01:39:20,050 --> 01:39:21,630
First off, there's not a lot of holidays.

1304
01:39:21,790 --> 01:39:23,710
So you can use one day on...

1305
01:39:23,710 --> 01:39:25,710
You can use the holidays to...

1306
01:39:25,710 --> 01:39:27,210
To fucking...

1307
01:39:27,210 --> 01:39:29,230
Make sure he doesn't escape.

1308
01:39:30,350 --> 01:39:31,930
Is he getting away with...

1309
01:39:31,950 --> 01:39:35,790
Just go somewhere else.

1310
01:39:36,230 --> 01:39:38,270
Clearly his only crime is in Gotham City.

1311
01:39:38,690 --> 01:39:41,610
So have a vacation outside of Gotham.

1312
01:39:42,130 --> 01:39:44,170
What about birthdays?

1313
01:39:44,850 --> 01:39:48,250
Okay, I don't think Calendar Man gives a fuck about
birthdays, guys.

1314
01:39:49,390 --> 01:39:50,510
That's not a holiday.

1315
01:39:50,850 --> 01:39:53,970
Your boss is not going to give you a holiday because it's
your birthday.

1316
01:39:54,490 --> 01:39:55,950
Don't fucking...

1317
01:39:57,070 --> 01:39:57,650
Guys.

1318
01:39:59,310 --> 01:40:01,770
Guys, you go to work on your birthday.

1319
01:40:01,950 --> 01:40:03,270
Welcome to adult life.

1320
01:40:03,390 --> 01:40:03,970
I'm sorry.

1321
01:40:06,930 --> 01:40:10,530
You're fucking working on your holiday, guys.

1322
01:40:23,370 --> 01:40:24,530
Stop talking.

1323
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:55,760
That is definitely news.

1324
01:40:56,660 --> 01:40:58,500
We don't have proof, but he's definitely dead.

1325
01:40:59,980 --> 01:41:03,680
I like how someone was like, But Doki, my birthday is on
summer break.

1326
01:41:04,160 --> 01:41:10,780
I hate to break it to you, but like, For some jobs, there's
no summer break.

1327
01:41:14,100 --> 01:41:15,900
In the adult world.

1328
01:41:22,680 --> 01:41:23,660
Okay, let's see.

1329
01:41:23,760 --> 01:41:24,740
We have to go this way.

1330
01:41:27,340 --> 01:41:28,760
No, don't tell it.

1331
01:41:29,100 --> 01:41:31,480
No, don't tell him that.

1332
01:41:32,460 --> 01:41:32,960
No!

1333
01:41:35,320 --> 01:41:37,500

01:42:17,700 --> 01:42:22,680
Oh, so like, you know, Radar, like, I don't care about these
guys now being out.

1340
01:42:25,920 --> 01:42:28,920
Because they're, like, weaker than the other goons.

1341
01:42:50,620 --> 01:42:52,240
Oh, do you think there's...

1342
01:43:01,070 --> 01:43:01,410
Wait.

1343
01:43:01,710 --> 01:43:03,170
This should be...

1344
01:43:03,170 --> 01:43:05,170
Did I unlock more in the Easter egg time?

1345
01:43:05,830 --> 01:43:06,650

01:43:36,710 --> 01:43:44,970

reason why I have, like, 500 robins.

1350
01:43:46,970 --> 01:43:49,410
I'm done playing with you right now.

1351
01:43:50,230 --> 01:43:51,690
Time for a new robin.

1352
01:43:56,810 --> 01:43:58,390
Alright, let's see.

1353
01:43:59,250 --> 01:44:02,910
These guys are so fucking weak, like, I just slap him once.

1354
01:44:04,030 --> 01:44:08,730
Like, I'm just like, am I supposed to be scared of these
guys?

1355
01:44:09,170 --> 01:44:11,790
Or am I gonna have, like, the regular Joker goons?

1356
01:44:12,710 --> 01:44:15,250
The regular ones are at least more of a challenge.

1357
01:44:15,590 --> 01:44:23,610
These guys are just it's just sad Oh, wait Wait, what?

01:44:36,780 --> 01:44:39,240
How did they beat up the guys with guns?

1361
01:44:39,680 --> 01:44:41,240
They're literally one-shot!

1362
01:44:41,980 --> 01:44:43,020
How did you die?

1363
01:44:44,080 --> 01:44:45,480
They're so weak

1364
01:44:51,360 --> 01:44:52,000
Help!

1365
01:45:07,980 --> 01:45:09,580
I'm too strong.

1366
01:45:10,220 --> 01:45:11,540
They have guns!

1367
01:45:13,520 --> 01:45:14,540
Okay, it's this way.

1368
01:45:22,550 --> 01:45:22,830
Wow.

1369
01:45:31,620 --> 01:45:33,180
Oh my, this is sad.

1370
01:45:33,180 --> 01:45:34,360
I'm- This is so sad.

1371
01:45:34,480 --> 01:45:35,020
Please stop.

1372
01:45:37,180 --> 01:45:38,700
This is too sad.

1373
01:45:39,040 --> 01:45:39,560
Please stop.

1374
01:45:41,480 --> 01:45:42,180
Please stop.

1375
01:45:43,920 --> 01:45:46,460
Dogs are supposed to get harder, not easier.

1376
01:45:46,940 --> 01:45:47,440
Come on.

1377
01:45:47,760 --> 01:45:50,240
What- Joker, you fucking fell off.

1378
01:45:51,900 --> 01:45:54,260
Like, the fact that it just takes one hit.

1379
01:45:54,620 --> 01:45:56,000
That's the saddest part.

1380
01:45:58,940 --> 01:45:59,680
What's the riddle?

1381
01:46:00,380 --> 01:46:01,600
I already forgot the riddle.

1382
01:46:01,900 --> 01:46:02,920
It's the free XP.

1383
01:46:03,700 --> 01:46:05,420
Thank you for the free XP.

1384
01:46:07,820 --> 01:46:09,400
What the fuck is the ridder?

1385
01:46:12,340 --> 01:46:14,200
Batman is too strong.

1386
01:46:15,960 --> 01:46:16,740
Wait, deceased?

1387
01:46:18,780 --> 01:46:19,940
Oh no, he's okay.

1388
01:46:20,120 --> 01:46:21,280
These guys are deceased.

1389
01:46:23,740 --> 01:46:24,420
In the graveyard?

1390
01:46:24,540 --> 01:46:25,700
Oh, it's on the other side.

1391
01:46:25,840 --> 01:46:26,100
Okay.

1392
01:46:27,500 --> 01:46:30,440
I thought like it was like, uh...

1393
01:46:30,920 --> 01:46:33,160
Okay, I thought it was like in that little hole.

1394
01:46:33,180 --> 01:46:33,840
that we're in.

1395
01:46:34,620 --> 01:46:35,660
All right, come over here.

1396
01:46:36,420 --> 01:46:36,420
Teeth!

1397
01:46:37,960 --> 01:46:38,840
Teeth!

1398
01:46:40,020 --> 01:46:40,020
Teeth!

1399
01:46:40,740 --> 01:46:41,580
There you go.

1400
01:46:43,140 --> 01:46:45,280
All right, we're gonna go to the gardens!

1401
01:46:45,720 --> 01:46:47,020
Poison Ivy!

1402
01:46:48,200 --> 01:46:50,160
I'm coming over!

1403
01:46:55,180 --> 01:46:56,060
Teeth!

1404
01:46:56,860 --> 01:47:00,100
Is the number up to the guards?

1405
01:47:04,250 --> 01:47:07,170
Oh, not botanical time?

1406
01:47:09,010 --> 01:47:10,730
Oh, no, it is a botanical tab.

1407
01:47:11,010 --> 01:47:11,390
Okay, locate.

1408
01:47:12,030 --> 01:47:12,830
Tracker thing.

1409
01:47:16,400 --> 01:47:17,260
Oh, there's your finger.

1410
01:47:17,340 --> 01:47:18,340
Wait, did she touch the floor?

1411
01:47:19,200 --> 01:47:20,580
Why the fuck did you touch the floor?

1412
01:47:22,680 --> 01:47:24,960
Oh, maybe she's, like, doing cartwheels, you know?

1413
01:47:25,540 --> 01:47:25,920
Maybe.

1414
01:47:27,100 --> 01:47:27,840
Wait, are they dead?

1415
01:47:27,980 --> 01:47:30,920
Oh, I was like, oh, how nice they're reading books.

1416
01:47:32,600 --> 01:47:34,500
Why is she touching so many floors?

1417
01:47:40,590 --> 01:47:40,990
Okay.

1418
01:47:41,130 --> 01:47:41,490
Okay.

1419
01:47:42,590 --> 01:47:44,090
Oh, watch this.

1420
01:47:45,290 --> 01:47:45,730
Okay.

1421
01:47:47,850 --> 01:47:49,010
Wait,

1422
01:47:52,830 --> 01:47:52,830
wait.

1423
01:47:53,430 --> 01:47:55,490
Watch this.

1424
01:48:00,450 --> 01:48:02,770
Come on.

1425
01:48:03,850 --> 01:48:04,950
It worked!

1426
01:48:05,230 --> 01:48:06,430
It's one!

1427
01:48:06,790 --> 01:48:07,670
One is something!

1428
01:48:13,310 --> 01:48:14,790
What is something?

1429
01:48:18,930 --> 01:48:20,950
It's that easy.

1430
01:48:22,410 --> 01:48:22,470
Nice.

1431
01:48:22,690 --> 01:48:24,870
It's the number of...

1432
01:48:24,870 --> 01:48:29,070
You may still reach a level just below my genius one day.

1433
01:48:30,830 --> 01:48:31,490
What the fuck?

1434
01:48:31,650 --> 01:48:32,550
What did you say?

1435
01:48:33,330 --> 01:48:33,670
Scrub.

1436
01:48:33,810 --> 01:48:34,150
Thank you.

1437
01:48:34,490 --> 01:48:35,150
Super chat.

1438
01:48:35,310 --> 01:48:35,730
Thank you.

1439
01:48:35,730 --> 01:48:36,170
Thank you.

1440
01:48:36,350 --> 01:48:40,670
Please put me in a vegetable state so poison ivy will love
me.

1441
01:48:41,050 --> 01:48:41,350
Okay.

1442
01:48:42,870 --> 01:48:43,390
Okay.

1443
01:48:45,370 --> 01:48:46,450
That's pretty good.

1444
01:48:46,930 --> 01:48:48,510
Poison Ivy will never love you.

1445
01:48:53,130 --> 01:48:53,650
Alright.

1446
01:48:53,870 --> 01:48:54,990
What do we upgrade, guys?

1447
01:48:55,330 --> 01:48:56,790
What's the best upgrade to get?

1448
01:48:59,590 --> 01:49:00,790
I missed the tape.

1449
01:49:00,890 --> 01:49:01,470
Where's the tape?

1450
01:49:02,010 --> 01:49:03,070
Oh, tape on the bench?

1451
01:49:03,170 --> 01:49:03,490
Okay.

1452
01:49:05,870 --> 01:49:08,330
You have to face reality right now!

1453
01:49:09,330 --> 01:49:10,850
She's never gonna love you!

1454
01:49:11,510 --> 01:49:12,570
You're not a pig.

1455
01:49:13,570 --> 01:49:16,750
Even if you're a vegetable state, you don't have any greens
in you.

1456
01:49:22,760 --> 01:49:23,880
Your twin batteran?

1457
01:49:24,060 --> 01:49:25,660
Okay, I'm gonna get the twin batteram.

1458
01:49:26,080 --> 01:49:27,100
Combo batteram?

1459
01:49:27,420 --> 01:49:28,940
What the fuck is combo batteram?

1460
01:49:32,490 --> 01:49:33,270
Oh, shit.

1461
01:49:33,450 --> 01:49:33,630
Nice.

1462
01:49:33,710 --> 01:49:34,410
I'll do that.

1463
01:49:38,780 --> 01:49:41,700
If I want to plant, mommy, fucking date a florist.

1464
01:49:46,820 --> 01:49:48,240
It's less lethal.

1465
01:49:51,920 --> 01:49:55,720
There's no fucking...

1466
01:49:55,720 --> 01:49:57,120
There's no tape here.

1467
01:49:58,140 --> 01:49:59,560
Oh, there's tape here.

1468
01:50:03,070 --> 01:50:05,270
It's not the same.

1469
01:50:10,960 --> 01:50:12,960
Today is a special day.

1470
01:50:14,790 --> 01:50:16,610
This is the anniversary of...

1471
01:50:37,370 --> 01:50:39,790
He showed me the bigger world.

1472
01:50:44,900 --> 01:50:47,500
You tried to kill everyone in Gotham.

1473
01:50:47,820 --> 01:50:51,440
Well, sometimes you need to broom back hard in order to make
something flourish.

1474
01:50:53,100 --> 01:50:59,260
To be fair, if she was a real eco-terrorist, she would not
be aiming for Gotham City.

1475
01:51:00,380 --> 01:51:03,320
Because she could just aim for the oil rigs in the ocean.

1476
01:51:04,160 --> 01:51:07,320
That's like owned by the entire, like by private
corporations.

1477
01:51:07,520 --> 01:51:09,200
That's not in Gotham City.

1478
01:51:11,480 --> 01:51:14,360
Not a real eco-terrorist.

1479
01:51:16,540 --> 01:51:17,820
Fucking rookie.

1480
01:51:25,820 --> 01:51:41,960
but she's just a rookie you gotta start small if she wants
to change the world she should not be aiming for small poser

1481
01:51:41,960 --> 01:51:43,440
what a fucking poser

1482
01:51:46,600 --> 01:51:49,920

01:51:57,400 --> 01:52:08,080

1484
01:52:08,080 --> 01:52:15,820

like the whole idea is that um any publicity is good

1485
01:52:15,820 --> 01:52:26,940
publicity so like do they have guns oh they do that's scary
oh that's a lot of them or sorry soup they threw soup at the

1486
01:52:26,940 --> 01:52:31,580
Mona Lisa because their idea is that any publicity is good

1487
01:52:32,100 --> 01:52:33,580
So they're like, weirr.

1488
01:52:35,600 --> 01:52:36,020
Oops.

1490
01:52:38,500 --> 01:52:39,460
Ah, shit!

01:52:40,040 --> 01:52:40,880
Fly, fly, fly!

1492
01:52:42,980 --> 01:52:44,000
It's okay.

1493
01:52:44,100 --> 01:52:44,860
They always forget.

1494
01:52:46,140 --> 01:52:48,680
But like, it doesn't really work like that.

1495
01:52:50,060 --> 01:52:50,620
Wait, there's...

1496
01:52:50,620 --> 01:52:51,680

No, you guys.

1504
01:53:34,200 --> 01:53:34,600
No, no, no, no.

1505
01:53:34,680 --> 01:53:35,080
It was all.

1506
01:53:35,100 --> 01:53:37,160
I almost got a strike, guys.

1507
01:53:38,460 --> 01:53:40,040
I almost did it.

1508
01:53:40,100 --> 01:53:41,940
You don't understand.

1509
01:53:47,260 --> 01:53:47,980
There you go.

1510
01:53:49,420 --> 01:53:50,060
That's different.

1511
01:53:59,090 --> 01:53:59,770

There you go.

1515
01:54:05,750 --> 01:54:06,650
Alright, it's fine.

1516
01:54:06,910 --> 01:54:07,250
fine.

1517
01:54:08,050 --> 01:54:09,430
How do I activate?

1518
01:54:09,650 --> 01:54:11,410
Okay, I don't have double batter hands yet.

1519
01:54:13,110 --> 01:54:13,690
No!

1520
01:54:18,080 --> 01:54:20,100

How did he get him so fast?

1526
01:54:34,750 --> 01:54:37,030
How did he get him so fast?

1527
01:54:37,230 --> 01:54:38,170
I don't understand!

1528
01:54:39,610 --> 01:54:40,210
No!

1529
01:54:45,080 --> 01:54:46,980
Joker, you ghoster!

1530
01:54:49,320 --> 01:54:51,000
Joker's ghosting!

Fucking no integrity!

1535
01:55:04,960 --> 01:55:08,320
I can't believe my criminal doesn't have any integrity.

1536
01:55:09,320 --> 01:55:11,440
It's so fucked up.

1537
01:55:12,600 --> 01:55:14,120
I'm just gonna...

1538
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:15,300
Nothing?

1539
01:55:17,100 --> 01:55:18,620
That's so fucked up.

1540
01:55:20,260 --> 01:55:20,680
No.

1541

I eat punks like these for breakfast.

1638
02:02:50,480 --> 02:02:51,500
What were they doing in here?

1639
02:02:52,020 --> 02:02:56,020
The ones that weren't hitting me went over there and started
doing something to the power controls.

1640
02:02:56,500 --> 02:02:58,040
I have no idea what they were doing.

1641
02:03:02,510 --> 02:03:10,070
Karatad next to the the crowbar looks like Joker is booby
trapped as control box this is going to be tougher than

1646
02:03:39,500 --> 02:03:40,120
I did it.

1647
02:03:41,080 --> 02:03:44,920
I thought the gardens would be the last place those escaped
goons would be interested in.

1648
02:03:45,680 --> 02:03:47,200
So much for logic in this place.

1649
02:03:47,280 --> 02:03:48,420
Maybe just leave.

1650
02:03:50,140 --> 02:03:52,000
Actually, no, they can't leave because it's an island.

1651
02:03:53,060 --> 02:03:54,520
I was wondering, where are the boats?

1652
02:03:56,860 --> 02:03:58,480
Sorry, he can't just leave.

1653
02:03:59,580 --> 02:04:01,400
Yeah, but like, poison ivy.

1654
02:04:01,540 --> 02:04:03,500
Why would you think it's the last place people will leave?

1655
02:04:03,520 --> 02:04:03,780
B.

1656
02:04:03,960 --> 02:04:04,960
It's literally poisonous.

1657
02:04:05,220 --> 02:04:06,420
What the fuck?

1658
02:04:07,160 --> 02:04:08,100
What are all these?

1659
02:04:10,220 --> 02:04:11,800
Are these things at the bottom?

1660
02:04:12,160 --> 02:04:13,560
Oh, it's the booby traps.

1661
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:14,000
Okay.

1662
02:04:15,640 --> 02:04:17,940
What do I do?

1663
02:04:21,170 --> 02:04:22,270
Wait, can't you swim?

1664
02:04:22,550 --> 02:04:22,890

1666
02:04:27,510 --> 02:04:29,170
Couldn't this guy fucking swim?

1667
02:04:31,910 --> 02:04:34,870
There's no sharks in fucking got... Actually, there might
be.

She lost her license.

1679
02:07:01,960 --> 02:07:04,600
I can't believe murder can make you lose your license.

1680
02:07:04,860 --> 02:07:05,940
It's a bit unfair.

1681
02:07:19,080 --> 02:07:20,060
You're right.

1682
02:07:20,320 --> 02:07:21,740
You can't revoke a PhD.

1710
02:09:01,540 --> 02:09:04,440
She can't even practice her fucking doctorate.

1711
02:09:06,720 --> 02:09:08,660
Her PhD is useless.

1712
02:09:11,540 --> 02:09:24,860
Also, where the fuck is mad hatter puzzle she can't just not
legally oh

1713
02:09:30,260 --> 02:09:40,800
so now she's not she was never a real doctor anyway it's a
PhD it's not even a medical doctor it's just professors it's

1714
02:09:40,800 --> 02:09:48,840
just a it's just a PhD professor he she writes research
papers not fucking not fucking cures cancer

1715
02:09:53,620 --> 02:10:01,240
okay but like you know oh there it is but like i'm not
trying to say professors do not deserve to be called doctors

1716
02:10:01,240 --> 02:10:03,800
i just want you guys to know that you know

1717
02:10:07,340 --> 02:10:12,380
i'm just saying that like you guys are saying she's a
medical doctor but she is not a medical doctor she is a

1718
02:10:12,380 --> 02:10:26,840
theoretical doctor i several people are typing a young age
with lewis caro's book of alice adventures in wonderland

1719
02:10:26,840 --> 02:10:35,160
jarvis is uh jarvis jarvis jervis tech and expert hypnotist
embraced the delusion that he was the incarnation of a

1720
02:10:35,160 --> 02:10:43,580
character in the story the mad hatter using his skills for
mesmerism the mad hatter has committed many crimes often

1721
02:10:43,580 --> 02:10:49,400
themed around the book that inspired him and his love of
hats and headgear oh my god he plays Team Fortress 2.

1722
02:10:50,140 --> 02:10:57,640
Doing so far as to implant his hats with mind-controlled
chips to amplify the synopsis skills.

1723
02:10:58,300 --> 02:11:05,520
Above all other headwear, however, he covets Batman's
distinctive cal and will stop at just fucking hiring a

1724
02:11:05,520 --> 02:11:06,240
cosplayer!

1725
02:11:08,640 --> 02:11:09,760
Make it...

1726
02:11:09,760 --> 02:11:11,660
Oh yeah, it's a collector's item.

1727
02:11:13,940 --> 02:11:17,480
Oh, he wants especially one of a kind items.

1728
02:11:20,450 --> 02:11:21,770
All right, where do I go?

1729
02:11:22,350 --> 02:11:23,730
It's this way.

1730
02:11:25,530 --> 02:11:27,630
He wants the real thing.

1731
02:11:30,310 --> 02:11:31,850
He wants the one of a kind color.

1732
02:11:32,150 --> 02:11:35,690
Okay, but like Batman does not have one bat suit.

1733
02:11:35,950 --> 02:11:36,710
That's all I'm going to say.

1734
02:11:37,270 --> 02:11:39,930
There's no way he has one bat suit.

1735
02:11:42,190 --> 02:11:45,550
Just give him the cow to stop so he stop.

1736
02:11:45,790 --> 02:11:47,210
He's also schizophrenic.

1737
02:11:47,370 --> 02:11:48,610
They're all schizophrenic!

1738
02:11:49,070 --> 02:12:00,550
there's a pattern Batman oh shit at this rate you'll never
catch me Batman if the majority of the villain is

1739
02:12:00,550 --> 02:12:12,870
schizophrenic maybe the issue is the schizophrenia that's
running around fucking Gotham City he's also schizophrenic I

1740
02:12:12,870 --> 02:12:19,710
swear 80% of these villains are just schizophrenic Look!

1741
02:12:22,690 --> 02:12:23,770
Delusion schizophrenic!

1742
02:12:26,980 --> 02:12:29,460
There must be something... You know, it might be the water,
honestly.

1743
02:12:29,640 --> 02:12:33,760
I feel like there's something wrong with the gene pool in
Gotham City.

1744
02:12:36,780 --> 02:12:40,680
Like, it's like Australia where like all the criminals got
like...

1745
02:12:40,680 --> 02:12:44,480
got like deported to Australia a long time ago.

1746
02:12:45,400 --> 02:12:48,860
Like, I feel like at this point there's... there's has to be
a pattern.

1747
02:13:07,550 --> 02:13:10,030
Like, there's something has to be in the water!

1748
02:13:10,430 --> 02:13:13,270
Or, like, medical history, there's something wrong!

1749
02:13:15,530 --> 02:13:15,790
Batman!

1750
02:13:18,770 --> 02:13:23,310
Please, fund the medical facilities in Gotham City, Batman!

1751
02:13:24,110 --> 02:13:25,510
That's all we need!

1752
02:13:26,510 --> 02:13:28,510
We can fix it so easily.

1753
02:13:35,760 --> 02:13:37,520
It's always the water.

1754
02:13:44,160 --> 02:13:44,880
Oh, no.

1755
02:13:44,900 --> 02:13:46,900
Oh, hey.

1756
02:13:47,280 --> 02:13:47,840
Reload me this.

1757
02:13:48,020 --> 02:13:48,560
Oh, no.

1758
02:13:48,880 --> 02:13:50,740
Why is there mushrooms here?

1759
02:13:55,550 --> 02:13:55,810
Oh.

1760
02:14:00,990 --> 02:14:02,330
Here we go.

1761
02:14:05,370 --> 02:14:06,010
Nice.

1762
02:14:09,530 --> 02:14:13,790
Can't believe you blame my felonies on my genetics.

1763
02:14:15,110 --> 02:14:16,830
It's like the murder cheese.

1764
02:14:16,950 --> 02:14:17,610
Whoops, sorry.

1765
02:14:18,150 --> 02:14:20,150
It's like the murder cheese from Riverdale.

1766
02:14:32,470 --> 02:14:34,090
I make sure there's...

1767
02:14:34,090 --> 02:14:37,310
Oh, it's so nice that the mod gets rid of the flashbang.

1768
02:14:37,790 --> 02:14:39,930
It's actually so fucking nice, man.

1769
02:14:41,750 --> 02:14:42,570
Holy shit.

1770
02:14:42,770 --> 02:14:45,710
The shadows can only be seen by those with a different view
of life.

1771
02:14:45,830 --> 02:14:47,030
What the fuck does that mean?

1772
02:14:50,640 --> 02:14:51,160
What?

1773
02:14:52,360 --> 02:14:53,600
What the fuck is that?

1774
02:15:00,850 --> 02:15:01,370
Joker?

1775
02:15:10,940 --> 02:15:11,460
Ooh.

1776
02:15:11,820 --> 02:15:13,020
I don't like this.

1777
02:15:19,140 --> 02:15:20,760
I don't like this.

1778
02:15:20,780 --> 02:15:21,320
Joker.

1779
02:15:23,960 --> 02:15:25,440
What the fuck do I get out of here?

1780
02:15:25,600 --> 02:15:26,020
Oh, this way.

1781
02:15:27,700 --> 02:15:28,220
Wee!

1782
02:15:29,800 --> 02:15:31,940
I missed the scan in the vent.

1783
02:15:32,340 --> 02:15:32,760
It's alright.

1784
02:15:36,840 --> 02:15:38,260
I cannot deal with mazes.

1785
02:15:40,260 --> 02:15:43,340
A rat catcher needs more than just his charm to lead.

1786
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:45,280
Oh, it's the Pied Piper.

1787
02:15:48,660 --> 02:15:50,420
I need to scan some rats.

1788
02:15:52,620 --> 02:15:54,920
Where are the rats?

1789
02:15:58,470 --> 02:15:58,950
Whoop.

1790
02:16:00,070 --> 02:16:01,150
What the fuck is that?

1791
02:16:01,550 --> 02:16:01,550
Oh.

1792
02:16:01,970 --> 02:16:06,230
I told you what you wanted to know.

1793
02:16:07,370 --> 02:16:08,330
Pulling time.

1794
02:16:10,270 --> 02:16:11,230
You can let me go.

1795
02:16:11,510 --> 02:16:13,970
Hey, you promise you won't tell anyone about Joker's plan?

1796
02:16:15,010 --> 02:16:15,930
Well, okay then.

1797
02:16:16,530 --> 02:16:17,630
Help this guy to his feet.

1798
02:16:17,990 --> 02:16:19,010
Then shoot him in the face.

1799
02:16:19,210 --> 02:16:22,190
Why do we always go back to Riverdale, Toki?

1800
02:16:24,090 --> 02:16:25,730
Alan, thank you, thank you.

1801
02:16:25,970 --> 02:16:27,990
You think we just let you walk out of here?

1802
02:16:28,850 --> 02:16:29,750
Doesn't even have guns.

1803
02:16:29,890 --> 02:16:30,690
How do they shoot?

1804
02:16:30,790 --> 02:16:31,190
It's funny.

1805
02:16:31,350 --> 02:16:31,790
Listen up.

1806
02:16:32,190 --> 02:16:33,690
I'm going to kick you a bit more.

1807
02:16:34,010 --> 02:16:37,590
Then when you pass out, I drag you back in there and throw
you down the hall.

1808
02:16:37,970 --> 02:16:39,130
Let all your friends watch.

1809
02:16:39,290 --> 02:16:39,690
Yeah.

1810
02:16:41,030 --> 02:16:42,530
I could stop this at...

1811
02:16:42,530 --> 02:16:42,650
Oh!

1812
02:16:43,430 --> 02:16:47,090
I could have stopped this at any time, but I had to stay
there for a long.

1813
02:16:47,310 --> 02:16:49,050
How fucked up are you, Doki?

1814
02:16:52,030 --> 02:16:52,830
I'm sorry.

1815
02:16:54,090 --> 02:16:56,530
I saved you earlier, but the lore was more important!

1816
02:17:00,730 --> 02:17:04,090
God damn, I hated when they interrupted my fucking
finishers.

1817
02:17:05,730 --> 02:17:08,050
I'm so sorry, man, the lore was just too good.

1818
02:17:13,480 --> 02:17:14,480
Alright, are you okay?

1819
02:17:14,760 --> 02:17:16,460
Sorry for giving you extra trauma.

1820
02:17:20,090 --> 02:17:20,910
Are you okay?

1821
02:17:21,510 --> 02:17:22,790
Do I look okay?

1822
02:17:23,390 --> 02:17:24,630
They were gonna kill me.

1823
02:17:25,310 --> 02:17:27,150
Yeah, I just got there, sorry.

1824
02:17:28,770 --> 02:17:30,870
I literally just got there.

1825
02:17:31,930 --> 02:17:33,530
Are they still in there?

1826
02:17:33,830 --> 02:17:34,330
No, man.

1827
02:17:34,630 --> 02:17:35,790
No one's come out since.

1828
02:17:36,570 --> 02:17:37,730
You've got to help them.

1829
02:17:38,390 --> 02:17:39,090
Stay here.

1830
02:17:40,170 --> 02:17:41,030
I was not watching.

1831
02:17:41,190 --> 02:17:42,230
I swear to God.

1832
02:17:43,990 --> 02:17:45,750
Rescue orderlies held hostage in the Avery.

1833
02:17:46,010 --> 02:17:46,650
In the Avery.

1834
02:17:46,970 --> 02:17:47,870
Where am I?

1835
02:17:48,490 --> 02:17:50,390
There's so many objectives.

1836
02:17:54,520 --> 02:17:55,120
Oh my god.

1837
02:17:55,180 --> 02:17:56,860
There's so many things to do.

1838
02:17:57,520 --> 02:17:58,800
Can't you do this?

1839
02:18:00,180 --> 02:18:00,760
Okay.

1840
02:18:00,780 --> 02:18:01,080
Okay.

1841
02:18:02,120 --> 02:18:03,220
Oh, hey, really need this.

1842
02:18:03,340 --> 02:18:04,840
Oh, I don't have that thing again.

1843
02:18:07,000 --> 02:18:08,040
Is it this way?

1844
02:18:09,620 --> 02:18:11,140
Yeah, that should be it.

1845
02:18:17,180 --> 02:18:18,520
Where are the fucking rats?

1846
02:18:55,920 --> 02:18:58,620
She's using her womanly charms against him.

1847
02:18:59,300 --> 02:19:00,420
Ducky, thank you, my super chat.

1848
02:19:00,660 --> 02:19:01,400
Thank you, thank you.

1849
02:19:01,520 --> 02:19:05,280
Clearly, those grunts don't know the epic guy in Lowe's of
high school.

1850
02:19:06,300 --> 02:19:08,360
I fucking love that quote.

1851
02:19:13,240 --> 02:19:14,120
Is this a tribute to...

1852
02:19:14,120 --> 02:19:15,060
Oh, wait, Constantine?

1853
02:19:16,780 --> 02:19:17,660
Oh, Constance.

1854
02:19:17,800 --> 02:19:18,680
Okay, never mind.

1855
02:19:24,110 --> 02:19:27,050
There's no claws in the guard so someone's using the roof
instead.

1856
02:19:28,190 --> 02:19:29,530
Is that one of the orderlies?

1857
02:19:30,790 --> 02:19:32,670
Wait, how did they get them in there?

1858
02:19:32,670 --> 02:19:34,390
The bat is on the way.

1859
02:19:34,810 --> 02:19:37,470
If you see him, send the annoying doctors to hell.

1860
02:19:41,290 --> 02:19:43,630
Yeah, they're going down.

1861
02:19:51,410 --> 02:19:51,750
Oh.

1862
02:19:55,850 --> 02:19:57,130
If I hear what?

1863
02:19:57,750 --> 02:19:59,610
If I hear what, Joker!

1864
02:20:01,670 --> 02:20:03,630
What am I going to hear?

1865
02:20:05,350 --> 02:20:05,950
Joker!

1866
02:20:06,710 --> 02:20:07,990
If I hear what?

1867
02:20:12,130 --> 02:20:13,770
I'll never know.

1868
02:20:14,630 --> 02:20:16,730
I'll never know, guys.

1869
02:20:19,730 --> 02:20:21,990
Oh my god, I was too slow.

1870
02:20:22,610 --> 02:20:24,810
I'll never know what I'm gonna hear.

1871
02:20:27,590 --> 02:20:28,210
My god.

1872
02:20:28,810 --> 02:20:30,030
I can't believe it.

1873
02:20:30,670 --> 02:20:31,710
That was too slow.

1874
02:20:33,330 --> 02:20:33,750
Please.

1875
02:20:34,350 --> 02:20:35,350
Did it crash again?

1876
02:20:35,490 --> 02:20:36,490
Like, what?

1877
02:20:37,350 --> 02:20:39,670
Oh my god, it crashed again.

1878
02:20:40,570 --> 02:20:41,190
No!

1879
02:20:42,470 --> 02:20:44,950
Give me a second, crash it again.

1880
02:20:45,070 --> 02:20:46,410
Let me...

1881
02:20:46,410 --> 02:20:46,930
Yeah.

1882
02:20:49,490 --> 02:20:50,070
Play.

1883
02:20:52,950 --> 02:20:54,370
Next time, man.

1884
02:20:56,770 --> 02:20:57,810
Do be fair.

1885
02:20:57,950 --> 02:21:00,030
Like, this PC has been like...

1886
02:21:00,030 --> 02:21:01,790
It's just been like Frankenstein.

1887
02:21:02,530 --> 02:21:03,330
For us.

1888
02:21:04,650 --> 02:21:09,930
So maybe there has always been that one part that's fucking
up my PC, but I'll never know.

1889
02:21:10,030 --> 02:21:10,610
Okay.

1890
02:21:18,920 --> 02:21:20,720
Played it recently, mod 3 and still crashes.

1891
02:21:20,840 --> 02:21:21,440
It's not me!

1892
02:21:21,700 --> 02:21:22,420
It's just that...

1893
02:21:22,420 --> 02:21:23,980
Okay, games that are like...

1894
02:21:24,860 --> 02:21:28,320
Old games are not compatible with new stuff, to be fair.

1895
02:21:28,660 --> 02:21:30,380
Because, like, you know...

1896
02:21:30,380 --> 02:21:35,400
Like, they're not compatible in terms of, like, the more new
it is.

1897
02:21:35,460 --> 02:21:39,280
Like, the graphics cards are not compatible with the old
shit in games.

1898
02:21:39,740 --> 02:21:41,120
Alright, y'all finally...

1899
02:21:41,120 --> 02:21:42,380
I finally know!

1900
02:21:42,740 --> 02:21:43,980
Get me out of this thing!

1901
02:21:46,040 --> 02:21:48,220
Listen, the Batman's on the way.

1902
02:21:48,780 --> 02:21:51,440
If you see him, send the annoying doctors to happen.

1903
02:21:51,600 --> 02:21:52,520
Yeah, the optimization.

1904
02:21:52,780 --> 02:21:54,240
That's the down one, right?

1905
02:21:55,260 --> 02:21:55,680
Yeah.

1906
02:21:56,400 --> 02:21:57,700
They're going down.

1907
02:22:06,640 --> 02:22:08,800
Joker's men are all wearing the security colors.

1908
02:22:09,460 --> 02:22:11,600
I'll need to take out the operator first.

1909
02:22:12,880 --> 02:22:14,080
No, is this stealth?

1910
02:22:15,460 --> 02:22:15,980
No.

1911
02:22:17,680 --> 02:22:18,200
No.

1912
02:22:20,180 --> 02:22:21,420
Is this stealth?

1913
02:22:21,800 --> 02:22:22,320
No!

1914
02:22:26,100 --> 02:22:29,020
Okay, okay, I have the Sonic Battle Ram.

1915
02:22:31,340 --> 02:22:32,720
There you go.

1916
02:22:33,240 --> 02:22:33,520
Look over.

1917
02:22:33,760 --> 02:22:33,920
What?

1918
02:22:35,140 --> 02:22:35,560
No!

1919
02:22:36,780 --> 02:22:39,060
It could be anybody's Battle Ram!

1920
02:22:42,240 --> 02:22:44,440
It could be anybody's!

1921
02:22:44,800 --> 02:22:46,140
Why would it be me?

1922
02:22:50,840 --> 02:22:52,960
Guys, it could be anybody!

1923
02:22:54,060 --> 02:22:54,860
I don't understand.

1924
02:22:54,940 --> 02:22:55,840
How did he know?

1925
02:22:56,980 --> 02:22:58,600
How did he know?

1926
02:23:01,660 --> 02:23:03,940
It could be Robbins.

1927
02:23:04,580 --> 02:23:07,340
Like, how did he know it's mine?

1928
02:23:07,660 --> 02:23:08,960
I don't understand.

1929
02:23:12,180 --> 02:23:13,940
It literally could have been anybody's.

1930
02:23:14,120 --> 02:23:15,100
That's all I'm going to say.

1931
02:23:16,160 --> 02:23:16,280
Who else?

1932
02:23:16,340 --> 02:23:17,020
I don't know.

1933
02:23:17,160 --> 02:23:18,980
Other bat enthusiast.

1934
02:23:20,440 --> 02:23:22,200
Why did Junker crash the game?

1935
02:23:22,320 --> 02:23:23,380
Is he stupid?

1936
02:23:23,840 --> 02:23:25,980
Thank you for the super chat.

1937
02:23:26,100 --> 02:23:27,360
Thank you, thank you.

1938
02:23:29,780 --> 02:23:33,080
It could have been a Batman fan, you know?

1939
02:23:34,060 --> 02:23:35,780
Okay, all right.

1940
02:23:36,980 --> 02:23:38,020
It's capitalism.

1941
02:23:38,800 --> 02:23:43,480
Someone, they must have sold, like, bootleg Batman Battle
Rams.

1942
02:23:44,340 --> 02:23:44,600
All right?

1943
02:23:44,920 --> 02:23:47,740
Like, someone has merchandise, Batman.

1944
02:23:48,580 --> 02:23:52,620
I bet you, Bruce, I bet you Bruce Wayne has, like, trademark
Batman.

1945
02:24:00,780 --> 02:24:07,140
There's no fucking way Battle Ramps are not like a trademark
item where people fucking sell it.

1946
02:24:07,620 --> 02:24:08,960
There's no fucking way.

1947
02:24:09,400 --> 02:24:09,920
No.

1948
02:24:15,540 --> 02:24:16,960
Joker wants some style.

1949
02:24:17,440 --> 02:24:18,560
I'm gonna do it.

1950
02:24:19,080 --> 02:24:20,700
I don't know how that works, but okay.

1951
02:24:21,480 --> 02:24:22,980
Yes, but no.

1952
02:24:28,370 --> 02:24:30,090
There's no fucking way.

1953
02:24:30,270 --> 02:24:32,170
He does not have Batman trademarked.

1954
02:24:32,890 --> 02:24:35,630
Pretend that's the same metal Kate, right?

1955
02:24:35,910 --> 02:24:36,850
Thank you for the super chat.

1956
02:24:37,190 --> 02:24:37,330
Thank you.

1957
02:24:37,710 --> 02:24:38,090
Thank you.

1958
02:24:38,590 --> 02:24:40,350
There has to be Batman merch.

1959
02:24:40,690 --> 02:24:42,210
It's fucking capitalism.

1960
02:24:42,850 --> 02:24:46,390
Why would they not fucking capitalize on Batman?

1961
02:24:49,810 --> 02:24:51,990
I bet you Batman is somebody's Oshi.

1962
02:25:01,510 --> 02:25:04,150
Hey, how the fuck do I do this?

1963
02:25:04,330 --> 02:25:09,590
Batman better not try and mess with us not kill him

1964
02:25:12,790 --> 02:25:37,850
Okay No No I can't believe it I'm so close How Oh my god,
how I'm so fucking sad.

1965
02:25:39,410 --> 02:25:40,910
I'm so sad.

1966
02:25:41,490 --> 02:25:43,790
I was doing so well.

1967
02:25:44,770 --> 02:25:46,130
He saw my hands.

1968
02:25:46,330 --> 02:25:47,470
I don't understand.

1969
02:25:49,510 --> 02:25:53,330
Kaz, Bruce Wayne having Batman trademark will be a little
bit sussy.

1970
02:25:53,630 --> 02:25:54,730
Thank you for the super chat.

1971
02:25:55,090 --> 02:25:55,250
Thank you.

1972
02:25:55,590 --> 02:25:56,030
Thank you.

1973
02:25:56,090 --> 02:25:58,270
That's why he has so many robins!

1974
02:25:58,590 --> 02:25:59,030
Exactly!

1975
02:25:59,930 --> 02:26:02,370
Limited edition new robin merch!

1976
02:26:02,890 --> 02:26:04,070
Oh my god.

1977
02:26:04,330 --> 02:26:06,850
Bro, it makes so much more sense.

1978
02:26:10,970 --> 02:26:12,530
I am cast.

1979
02:26:12,750 --> 02:26:13,870
Thank you for the super chat.

1980
02:26:14,210 --> 02:26:14,410
Thank you.

1981
02:26:14,510 --> 02:26:15,230
Thank you.

1982
02:26:16,450 --> 02:26:17,890
It makes sense.

1983
02:26:30,580 --> 02:26:31,480
Stop it.

1984
02:26:32,780 --> 02:26:34,600
New Robin debut.

1985
02:26:35,620 --> 02:26:36,340

1987
02:26:39,160 --> 02:26:39,880
Help me.

02:26:40,380 --> 02:26:40,860
Someone.

1989
02:26:41,440 --> 02:26:42,500
Get me out of this thing.

1990
02:26:42,860 --> 02:26:43,000
Yeah.

1991
02:26:44,080 --> 02:26:44,700
Okay.

1992
02:26:44,960 --> 02:26:45,760
Jason was not making it.

1993
02:26:45,780 --> 02:26:55,860
enough money so they had to they had to graduate him but
then it was a publicity stunt so it boosted Jason's number

1994
02:26:55,860 --> 02:27:05,100
it boosted Jason's number by grad by and then like they
brought him back they ungraduated him it's

1995
02:27:10,500 --> 02:27:18,640
so smart Bruce is so fucking smart oh my god this is how he
became a billionaire this is exactly how merchandising

1996
02:27:18,640 --> 02:27:34,360
merchandising Batman merchandising is the most lucrative
like It's the most lucrative way to earn money from him Wait

1997
02:27:34,360 --> 02:27:37,240
scan the guy on the wall There's a guy

1998
02:27:49,190 --> 02:27:54,570
Yeah but tech is like a side thing It's the side gear Oh
this guy

1999
02:27:59,970 --> 02:28:01,970
Killer that's the killer mod

2000
02:28:06,230 --> 02:28:12,610
Walker was a minor criminal who adopted the identity of
Cameron Van Cleer, a bastard criminal who in turn

2001
02:28:12,610 --> 02:28:15,630
masqueraded as a costume super villain, killer moth.

2002
02:28:16,070 --> 02:28:19,350
He has a hired gun for Gotham's Oh my god.

2003
02:28:20,090 --> 02:28:21,310
It looks fucking stupid.

2004
02:28:22,170 --> 02:28:27,530
But his, and he used a weapon including his Cancun gun, does
not protect him from regular defeat at the hands of Batman.

2005
02:28:27,890 --> 02:28:29,530
We don't fuck would hire this guy.

2006
02:28:31,730 --> 02:28:34,470
With the fame and identity chance, skilled inventor.

2007
02:28:35,350 --> 02:28:37,530
Immoral and way of my feelings of insecurity.

2008
02:28:37,690 --> 02:28:39,770
Oh I'm sorry, I didn't mean that.

2009
02:28:43,790 --> 02:28:44,570
I'm sorry, man.

2010
02:28:44,750 --> 02:28:46,350
I didn't mean that.

2011
02:28:50,050 --> 02:28:51,550
I'm sorry, bro.

2012
02:28:51,910 --> 02:28:53,370
I was...

2013
02:28:53,370 --> 02:28:54,590
No, no, please.

2014
02:28:54,690 --> 02:28:56,470
I don't want to fuck it up again.

2015
02:29:05,160 --> 02:29:06,580
Okay, I can do this.

2016
02:29:07,460 --> 02:29:08,640
I can do this, guys.

2017
02:29:10,020 --> 02:29:11,560
You matter, Mothman.

2018
02:29:11,900 --> 02:29:12,720
You matter.

2019
02:29:14,460 --> 02:29:15,160
Why did I say that?

2020
02:29:15,180 --> 02:29:17,020
Fucking who told me to do the takedown?

2021
02:29:21,000 --> 02:29:21,520
Alright.

2022
02:29:21,840 --> 02:29:25,620
I listened to the one guy that was like you should do the
takedown.

2023
02:29:25,700 --> 02:29:28,180
And I was like I should do the takedown.

2024
02:29:34,560 --> 02:29:35,540
God damn it.

2025
02:29:36,840 --> 02:29:37,900
God damn it.

2026
02:29:38,000 --> 02:29:38,960
I got one guy.

2027
02:29:39,260 --> 02:29:40,320
It was me.

2028
02:29:41,020 --> 02:29:41,860
Fuck you.

2029
02:29:43,980 --> 02:29:46,820
I saw someone that was like do the silent takedown.

2030
02:29:47,020 --> 02:29:48,060
It'll be so funny.

2031
02:29:48,080 --> 02:29:52,100
I was like, whoa, really?

2032
02:29:52,380 --> 02:29:54,340
Would it actually be that funny?

2033
02:29:55,240 --> 02:29:55,640
Alright.

2034
02:29:56,320 --> 02:29:57,180
How the fuck?

2035
02:29:58,620 --> 02:29:59,840
Please get me out of here.

2036
02:30:00,820 --> 02:30:01,300
Please.

2037
02:30:01,460 --> 02:30:02,840
It was me, Barry.

2038
02:30:04,920 --> 02:30:07,400
God, just let these janitors die!

2039
02:30:07,600 --> 02:30:09,500
I don't care anymore.

2040
02:30:10,620 --> 02:30:11,920
Bab, I should get two.

2041
02:30:12,240 --> 02:30:13,880
She should get at least two.

2042
02:30:22,550 --> 02:30:25,190
All I'm saying is that I should get at least two.

2043
02:30:35,990 --> 02:30:36,990
Okay, I'm gonna run.

2044
02:30:37,170 --> 02:30:37,370
Alright.

2045
02:30:38,630 --> 02:30:39,790
Wait, do I have to scan it again?

2046
02:30:39,890 --> 02:30:41,910
Do I have to scan this fucker again?

2047
02:30:42,510 --> 02:30:44,830
I'll scan him later when I kill them all.

2048
02:30:47,650 --> 02:30:50,050
I'm gonna do that little thing I did earlier.

2049
02:30:50,850 --> 02:30:52,390
It doesn't stand a chance.

2050
02:30:52,590 --> 02:30:53,450
Not a chance.

2051
02:31:04,360 --> 02:31:04,780
There you go.

2052
02:31:05,740 --> 02:31:06,180
There you go.

2053
02:31:07,020 --> 02:31:08,170
I did it.

2054
02:31:09,320 --> 02:31:10,360
I fucking did it.

2055
02:31:13,500 --> 02:31:15,720
Take down the head henchmen.

2056
02:31:16,200 --> 02:31:16,200
What?

2057
02:31:16,440 --> 02:31:16,780
Take down?

2058
02:31:16,900 --> 02:31:17,500
Oh, I did it.

2059
02:31:20,220 --> 02:31:20,880
I did it.

2060
02:31:23,040 --> 02:31:24,460
Now pull the lever.

2061
02:31:24,720 --> 02:31:25,320
You're right.

2062
02:31:29,930 --> 02:31:31,090
Push try.

2063
02:31:34,710 --> 02:31:35,290
Okay.

2064
02:31:36,510 --> 02:31:38,470
Now I can scan him.

2065
02:31:46,900 --> 02:31:48,380
Wait, but is that what they want?

2066
02:31:48,580 --> 02:31:49,940
They get to be strong.

2067
02:31:53,020 --> 02:31:53,360
Oh, hey.

2068
02:31:53,500 --> 02:31:53,880
Hey there.

2069
02:31:54,240 --> 02:31:55,180
I didn't even see you.

2070
02:31:59,540 --> 02:32:00,680
Alright, where's the...

2071
02:32:00,680 --> 02:32:00,900
Where's he?

2072
02:32:01,960 --> 02:32:03,320
Let me scan him again.

2073
02:32:04,500 --> 02:32:05,860
Let me scan him first.

2074
02:32:06,000 --> 02:32:06,720
Don't come over!

2075
02:32:08,500 --> 02:32:09,220
Oh, shit.

2076
02:32:09,360 --> 02:32:09,620
Okay.

2077
02:32:10,400 --> 02:32:11,140
Get over here.

2078
02:32:11,840 --> 02:32:12,180
Oh, wait.

2079
02:32:12,220 --> 02:32:12,940
That's the last guy.

2080
02:32:13,240 --> 02:32:14,680
Oh, fuck.

2081
02:32:16,360 --> 02:32:16,800
Nice.

2082
02:32:17,080 --> 02:32:17,780
I did it.

2083
02:32:23,770 --> 02:32:25,710
Rob, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

2084
02:32:25,850 --> 02:32:28,150
I feel like Jason graduated from being big hit on the
Indies.

2085
02:32:28,250 --> 02:32:29,850
By the way, I'm loving the stream, Jokey, keep it.

2086
02:32:29,910 --> 02:32:31,830
Yeah, but he crawled back to Batman.

2087
02:32:36,920 --> 02:32:39,940
Joker wanted the entrance to the Titan production plant
guarded.

2088
02:32:40,280 --> 02:32:42,680
I should pick up Harley's trail again so I can find it.

2089
02:32:45,580 --> 02:32:46,840
Alright, cut over here.

2090
02:32:47,000 --> 02:32:48,140
I saved your life, we're gonna say.

2091
02:32:50,700 --> 02:32:51,820
Say thank you!

2092
02:32:52,700 --> 02:32:53,420
I'm sorry.

2093
02:32:54,080 --> 02:32:56,180
I thought I was working for Dr. Young.

2094
02:32:57,060 --> 02:33:00,120
I had no idea Joker was involved until he burst in the lab.

2095
02:33:01,300 --> 02:33:02,080
Where is the lab?

2096
02:33:02,700 --> 02:33:03,380
Back over there.

2097
02:33:03,500 --> 02:33:04,740
I always get buzzed through.

2098
02:33:05,540 --> 02:33:08,000
There's a hidden door, but, well, you know, it's hidden.

2099
02:33:08,640 --> 02:33:09,340
I'll find it.

2100
02:33:09,720 --> 02:33:10,280
Stay here.

2101
02:33:11,640 --> 02:33:12,760
Alright, let's go.

2102
02:33:19,830 --> 02:33:20,350
Wait, yes!

2103
02:33:20,370 --> 02:33:21,630
He does have a wife!

2104
02:33:23,190 --> 02:33:25,470
He does have a wife.

2105
02:33:26,790 --> 02:33:28,690
Other robins eventually come back.

2106
02:33:29,190 --> 02:33:31,630
The merchandising is just too good.

2107
02:33:32,690 --> 02:33:33,350
The branding.

2108
02:33:45,670 --> 02:33:47,730
It's almost like Nightwing.

2109
02:33:48,170 --> 02:33:49,690
Nightwing had a good...

2110
02:33:49,690 --> 02:33:52,290
Nightwing becomes Batman later.

2111
02:33:53,130 --> 02:33:54,430
He's part of the problem.

2112
02:33:57,710 --> 02:34:02,010
He doesn't have his solo career because he ends up becoming
Batman.

2113
02:34:04,190 --> 02:34:06,110
It's all connected.

2114
02:34:09,690 --> 02:34:10,690
Where'd I go?

2115
02:34:15,210 --> 02:34:16,750
Did I go the other way?

2116
02:34:17,430 --> 02:34:18,390
Oh yeah, I guess so.

2117
02:34:19,130 --> 02:34:20,110
Right at the other door, right?

2118
02:34:23,770 --> 02:34:25,750
Batman's just too good of a branding!

2119
02:34:26,050 --> 02:34:26,770
The capitalism!

2120
02:34:27,170 --> 02:34:28,010
It's just too good!

2121
02:34:28,870 --> 02:34:31,410
Just think about the merchandising!

2122
02:34:38,680 --> 02:34:40,480
Is it in Termina?

2123
02:34:41,380 --> 02:34:42,760
Oh, don't leave?

2124
02:34:42,880 --> 02:34:43,840
Okay, don't save.

2125
02:34:43,860 --> 02:34:45,880

2126
02:34:51,580 --> 02:35:03,700

2127
02:35:03,700 --> 02:35:05,440
sort of ran sorry

2128
02:35:08,880 --> 02:35:17,060
the wall there's a vent over there How do I get to that
vent?

2129
02:35:24,760 --> 02:35:25,700
Oh, it's this way.

2130
02:35:25,900 --> 02:35:26,080
Okay.

2131
02:35:27,040 --> 02:35:27,780
Oh, there it is.

2132
02:35:33,580 --> 02:35:33,980
Okay.

2133
02:35:34,060 --> 02:35:34,680
Oh, I can open it.

2134
02:35:34,720 --> 02:35:36,840
I was going to say I should use my backlaw or not.

2135
02:35:40,540 --> 02:35:42,720
I bet you Superman isn't even a farmish boy.

2136
02:35:42,820 --> 02:35:43,800
It's just all PR.

2137
02:35:48,600 --> 02:35:51,360
I bet you Clark Kent isn't a farm boy.

2138
02:35:51,980 --> 02:35:53,000
What the fuck is that?

2139
02:36:04,510 --> 02:36:05,230
Oh, no.

2140
02:36:05,410 --> 02:36:06,230
Don't say that.

2141
02:36:09,410 --> 02:36:09,810
Wait,

2142
02:36:16,590 --> 02:36:16,590
what?

2143
02:36:17,890 --> 02:36:18,750
I'm just back here.

2144
02:36:20,490 --> 02:36:21,450
Wait, I could have done that.

2145
02:36:22,590 --> 02:36:23,990
I could have just done this?

2146
02:36:26,990 --> 02:36:27,950
Wait, this is what...

2147
02:36:27,950 --> 02:36:28,890
This was naturally, no.

2148
02:36:28,990 --> 02:36:30,050
This was more complicated.

2149
02:36:33,510 --> 02:36:35,570
It was actually more complicated.

2150
02:36:35,670 --> 02:36:36,230
Not gonna lie.

2151
02:36:36,330 --> 02:36:37,590
What the fuck is this statue?

2152
02:36:39,130 --> 02:36:48,510

Okay.

02:37:26,170 --> 02:37:28,190
Time to do the Joker gas.

02:37:31,920 --> 02:37:32,440

2158
02:37:39,370 --> 02:37:40,390

Oh, there it is.

Oh, thank God it's next to me because I would never find it.

Thank fucking God.

2164
02:38:02,740 --> 02:38:03,040

02:38:57,210 --> 02:38:58,990
I cannot charge that!

2173
02:39:00,450 --> 02:39:02,350
Okay, that's bullshit.

2174
02:39:03,310 --> 02:39:04,910
That is so bullshit.

2175
02:39:08,070 --> 02:39:08,950
Oh shit.

2176
02:39:09,570 --> 02:39:10,530
Oh fuck.

2177
02:39:11,910 --> 02:39:13,830
What is he doing?

2178
02:39:14,830 --> 02:39:15,190
Ow.

2179
02:39:19,000 --> 02:39:20,380
That is okay.

2180
02:39:21,020 --> 02:39:22,260
That is actually bullshit.

2181
02:39:22,280 --> 02:39:23,280
Bullshit, though.

2182
02:39:23,680 --> 02:39:26,060
That is actually bullshit.

2183
02:39:27,500 --> 02:39:28,300
Alright, here we go.

2184
02:39:28,500 --> 02:39:28,940
There's two.

2185
02:39:29,320 --> 02:39:30,020
How the fuck?

2186
02:39:30,400 --> 02:39:30,500
No!

2187
02:39:31,500 --> 02:39:33,060
This is much worse!

2188
02:39:33,760 --> 02:39:34,100
No!

2189
02:39:41,240 --> 02:39:42,400
Okay, there you go.

2190
02:39:43,280 --> 02:39:45,180
I can hit both of them at the same time.

2191
02:39:47,560 --> 02:39:48,700
That's fucking right.

2192
02:39:49,280 --> 02:39:49,720
No!

2193
02:39:50,220 --> 02:39:51,400
He's in...

2194
02:39:51,400 --> 02:39:52,960
I need to get this guy, too!

2195
02:39:54,140 --> 02:39:55,180
What do I do?

2196
02:39:55,280 --> 02:39:56,620
Oh, I just didn't hit him.

2197
02:39:56,720 --> 02:39:56,960
Okay.

2198
02:39:59,540 --> 02:40:02,180
I'm just like, what do I do?

2199
02:40:03,260 --> 02:40:03,920
Get him, too.

2200
02:40:04,140 --> 02:40:04,620
That's right.

2201
02:40:04,720 --> 02:40:05,700
Stop hitting yourself.

2202
02:40:07,280 --> 02:40:08,600
Stop hitting yourself.

2203
02:40:10,380 --> 02:40:11,580
Are you guys stupid?

2204
02:40:11,860 --> 02:40:12,340
Oh, shit.

2205
02:40:12,500 --> 02:40:13,240
I didn't mean that.

2206
02:40:13,420 --> 02:40:14,320
I didn't mean that.

2207
02:40:14,460 --> 02:40:14,840
I didn't mean that.

2208
02:40:15,040 --> 02:40:15,520
I'm so sorry.

2209
02:40:15,640 --> 02:40:16,640
I did not mean that.

2210
02:40:19,000 --> 02:40:19,400
Oh.

2211
02:40:22,640 --> 02:40:23,180
Oh, my God.

2212
02:40:23,240 --> 02:40:24,260
They're picking up people.

2213
02:40:28,220 --> 02:40:31,460
Okay, I need a gift.

2214
02:40:31,820 --> 02:40:32,280
Get out of there.

2215
02:40:32,660 --> 02:40:33,780
Oh, okay.

It's the only way.

2222
02:40:47,440 --> 02:40:48,480
Tossing people.

2223
02:40:48,640 --> 02:40:49,400
That's illegal.

2224
02:40:49,600 --> 02:40:50,880
Why are they tossing people?

2225
02:40:51,400 --> 02:40:53,000
Why can't I toss people?

2226
02:40:53,080 --> 02:40:54,260

02:42:00,680 --> 02:42:01,180
Please.

2245
02:42:02,080 --> 02:42:02,540
Please.

2246
02:42:03,200 --> 02:42:04,600
Please let me pick you up!

2247
02:42:06,820 --> 02:42:09,220
You wouldn't let me pick him up.

2248
02:42:11,360 --> 02:42:11,860
Easy.

2249
02:42:15,600 --> 02:42:16,100
Oracle.

2250
02:42:16,720 --> 02:42:18,480
I've destroyed the Titan production facility.

2251
02:42:19,240 --> 02:42:21,680
But Joker escaped with enough to cause us real problems.

2252
02:42:22,060 --> 02:42:23,620
Just when you think it can't get any worse.

2253
02:42:24,200 --> 02:42:27,560
They've been using a venom plant hybrid to create the Titan
strain.

2254
02:42:30,320 --> 02:42:36,060
One person on Arkham Island who can help us and what makes
you think poison ivy will help you if her plants are at risk

2255
02:42:36,060 --> 02:42:36,860
She'll listen.

2256
02:42:37,660 --> 02:42:41,740
I have a sample of her plant life matters She'll be
somewhere in the gardens.

2257
02:42:42,160 --> 02:42:56,400
I'll track her down All right, let's go this way no way out
this elevator shaft mutual coming up It's time it's time

2258
02:42:56,400 --> 02:42:59,340
it's time for that one oh wait upgrade time

2259
02:43:05,340 --> 02:43:06,380
Upgrade time.

2260
02:43:07,980 --> 02:43:09,600
Which, what upgrade do we get?

2261
02:43:10,860 --> 02:43:12,260
That's why Ivy's gonna help us.

2262
02:43:12,340 --> 02:43:13,280
She loves plants.

2263
02:43:14,040 --> 02:43:17,980
I'm pretty sure they're getting, the plants are like getting
tortured right now, making that venom.

2264
02:43:21,280 --> 02:43:22,020
What do we get?

2265
02:43:22,840 --> 02:43:23,220
Health?

2266
02:43:23,400 --> 02:43:23,740
Armor?

2267
02:43:24,120 --> 02:43:24,660
Okay, armor.

2268
02:43:24,960 --> 02:43:25,220
Nice.

2269
02:43:28,040 --> 02:43:29,340
Don't worry, Ivy!

2270
02:43:31,540 --> 02:43:33,080
We're gonna commit...

2271
02:43:36,160 --> 02:43:39,240
I don't know if that is considered eco-terrorism.

2272
02:43:39,760 --> 02:43:41,080
I don't even...

2273
02:43:41,700 --> 02:43:43,600
No, because we're saving the plants.

2274
02:43:44,040 --> 02:43:45,280
No, no, we're good people.

2275
02:43:45,500 --> 02:43:46,360
Yes, we're good people.

2276
02:43:47,480 --> 02:43:48,940
We're good people this time.

2277
02:43:49,780 --> 02:43:50,900
Where the fuck is the terminal?

2278
02:43:51,740 --> 02:43:52,520
Oh, there it is.

2279
02:44:00,280 --> 02:44:00,980
How do I...

2280
02:44:02,180 --> 02:44:03,160
How do I...

2281
02:44:03,160 --> 02:44:04,440
How do I do this?

2282
02:44:05,660 --> 02:44:06,120
Where the fuck?

2283
02:44:06,220 --> 02:44:06,720
Oh, there it is.

2284
02:44:10,490 --> 02:44:12,750
I'm going to need something to get over this ravine.

2285
02:44:14,670 --> 02:44:15,230
How?

2286
02:44:22,810 --> 02:44:23,630
What did I do?

2287
02:44:24,250 --> 02:44:24,990
Oh, my ship!

2288
02:44:30,670 --> 02:44:31,490
The bat ship!

2289
02:44:35,720 --> 02:44:36,040
Whoa!

2290
02:44:40,560 --> 02:44:42,600
Why didn't you give me this earlier?

2291
02:44:48,370 --> 02:44:50,490
Should I just pick this up?

2292
02:44:58,710 --> 02:44:59,850
The line launcher.

2293
02:45:00,710 --> 02:45:01,630
That's right!

2294
02:45:02,050 --> 02:45:05,230
I can go back and do all this stuff that needs this.

2295
02:45:05,910 --> 02:45:06,970
But I won't.

2296
02:45:12,150 --> 02:45:14,670
But I won't.

2297
02:45:15,330 --> 02:45:15,550
Yay.

2298
02:45:23,490 --> 02:45:24,890
Where is Ivy?

2299
02:45:28,600 --> 02:45:31,560
Locate poison Ivy using the Thermo Trail.

2300
02:45:32,200 --> 02:45:33,160
Yeah, where is it?

2301
02:45:35,260 --> 02:45:36,940
That 24%.

2302
02:45:36,940 --> 02:45:39,500
I guess like...

2303
02:45:39,500 --> 02:45:41,920
Oh, the closer I get, the high percentage.

2304
02:45:45,640 --> 02:45:48,640
It's back this way.

2305
02:45:49,900 --> 02:45:51,760
I guess I could get that one-wheeler trophy.

2306
02:45:52,620 --> 02:45:53,920
I'll give you guys a one.

2307
02:45:54,260 --> 02:45:56,160
I'll give you guys, like, a plus one.

2308
02:45:57,180 --> 02:45:58,160
Don't worry.

2309
02:45:58,960 --> 02:45:59,840
Where is it?

2310
02:46:00,540 --> 02:46:00,980
Here?

2311
02:46:01,440 --> 02:46:01,980
It's here.

2312
02:46:02,840 --> 02:46:03,500
You gotta see?

2313
02:46:03,920 --> 02:46:05,140
I'm a good person.

2314
02:46:06,000 --> 02:46:07,660
I gave you guys that one.

2315
02:46:11,760 --> 02:46:12,340
Oh

2316
02:46:18,680 --> 02:46:32,280
Only oh only because it's I have to go here anyway The only
reason is because I have to be here Poison Abbey we're here

2317
02:46:32,280 --> 02:46:33,700
to save your plants.

2318
02:46:34,000 --> 02:46:42,040
I'm here now my poor darling Yes, I know he's found us but I
won't let him hurt you.

2319
02:46:43,060 --> 02:46:44,640
I'll kill him first.

2320
02:46:46,160 --> 02:46:46,560
Muddy.

2321
02:46:47,140 --> 02:46:49,880
I know Dr. Young mutated these plants to produce venom.

2322
02:46:50,620 --> 02:46:50,640
Yes.

2323
02:46:51,220 --> 02:46:54,860
And I heard it through the grapevine the evil woman paid the
price.

2324
02:46:56,840 --> 02:46:58,600
I need you to help me create an antidote.

2325
02:46:59,100 --> 02:46:59,860
Why should I?

2326
02:47:00,480 --> 02:47:01,940
Let Joker have his fun.

2327
02:47:02,740 --> 02:47:04,900
I'll enjoy watching you squirm.

2328
02:47:09,240 --> 02:47:09,920
Ow!

2329
02:47:12,760 --> 02:47:15,120
Are you still wearing a shirt?

2330
02:47:16,640 --> 02:47:18,620
Every plant on this island will get the same.

2331
02:47:18,760 --> 02:47:22,400
I mean as if like why is she wearing her like green outfit?

2332
02:47:22,860 --> 02:47:24,260
Growing deep in Arkham Island.

2333
02:47:24,960 --> 02:47:27,200
Only it can counter the effects of this time story.

2334
02:47:28,240 --> 02:47:29,720
Where do I find it?

2335
02:47:30,180 --> 02:47:32,120
Oh, and Killer Crocs lair.

2336
02:47:33,520 --> 02:47:36,240
You didn't think it would be easy, did you?

2337
02:47:37,860 --> 02:47:40,320
I mean her fucking plant outfit!

2338
02:47:40,840 --> 02:47:41,440

Save the bird.

2347
02:48:18,900 --> 02:48:20,760
Just let the innocent people die.

2348
02:48:21,100 --> 02:48:21,760
Okay, look.

2349
02:48:22,040 --> 02:48:23,400
Sometimes... Wait, what the fuck?

2350
02:48:24,260 --> 02:48:27,440
We don't have guns, though.

2351
02:48:27,500 --> 02:48:29,960
Can I just do this?

2352
02:48:36,820 --> 02:48:38,020
Alright, who's next?

2353
02:48:39,220 --> 02:48:40,060

Come on!

2356
02:48:43,700 --> 02:48:45,180
You can't dodge this forever!

2357
02:48:50,240 --> 02:48:51,120
That's right.

2358
02:48:54,100 --> 02:48:55,600
All right, get over here.

2359
02:48:56,680 --> 02:48:56,800
Nice.

2360
02:48:57,920 --> 02:48:58,660
All right, you know what?

2361
02:48:59,120 --> 02:49:00,860
By the, like, the eighth guy.

2362
02:49:01,120 --> 02:49:02,440
Look, he lined up, too.

2363
02:49:03,100 --> 02:49:05,200
They're like, me, my turn, my turn.

2364
02:49:08,240 --> 02:49:10,760
They're like, it's my turn.

2365
02:49:12,080 --> 02:49:13,640
All right, next is your turn.

2366
02:49:14,520 --> 02:49:15,060
Get over here.

2367
02:49:15,200 --> 02:49:16,280
Last guy.

2368
02:49:18,360 --> 02:49:18,800
Come on.

2369
02:49:18,860 --> 02:49:20,600
You can't dodge this forever.

2370
02:49:22,220 --> 02:49:22,700
Shout.

2371
02:49:23,460 --> 02:49:23,860
Hold on.

2372
02:49:23,880 --> 02:49:24,740
Thank you for the super chat.

2373
02:49:24,920 --> 02:49:25,100
Thank you.

2374
02:49:25,340 --> 02:49:25,900
Thank you.

2375
02:49:26,720 --> 02:49:27,180
Mommy.

2376
02:49:27,980 --> 02:49:28,600
Look at that.

2377
02:49:28,920 --> 02:49:29,880
It's that easy.

2378
02:49:31,980 --> 02:49:32,060
Hoop.

2379
02:49:34,740 --> 02:49:36,880
They didn't put their stats on intellect.

2380
02:49:37,120 --> 02:49:37,860
That's for sure.

2381
02:49:40,780 --> 02:49:41,160
Alright.

2382
02:49:41,320 --> 02:49:44,900
We gotta collect plant spores from Killer Crocs.

2383
02:49:45,200 --> 02:49:47,320
Talk to... Where the fuck is that?

2384
02:49:48,040 --> 02:49:50,160
Is that outside of Gotham?

2385
02:49:50,440 --> 02:49:51,140
Oh, it is.

2386
02:49:51,180 --> 02:49:53,020
It's at the Gotham Mansion.

2387
02:49:54,020 --> 02:49:55,480
Alright, how do I get out of here?

2388
02:49:55,540 --> 02:49:56,260
I don't remember.

2389
02:50:00,300 --> 02:50:01,300
This way?

2390
02:50:02,320 --> 02:50:03,160
Yes, this way.

2391
02:50:04,740 --> 02:50:05,100
Nice.

2392
02:50:05,240 --> 02:50:06,560
It was that easy.

2393
02:50:08,520 --> 02:50:09,480
Where are the rats?

2394
02:50:11,200 --> 02:50:12,400
Oh, I solved it.

2395
02:50:12,800 --> 02:50:13,820
You found that one too?

2396
02:50:15,200 --> 02:50:16,320
Humpty Dumpty.

2397
02:50:16,660 --> 02:50:18,740
Wait, I didn't know there's a Humpty Dumpty.

2398
02:50:19,980 --> 02:50:24,100
An obese, bald man named Humpty Dumpty is for his egg-like
form.

2399
02:50:24,400 --> 02:50:25,700
Humpty Dum...

2400
02:50:26,340 --> 02:50:28,200
Humphrey Dumpler is obsessed.

2401
02:50:28,280 --> 02:50:30,640
Okay, now that's just her parents being cruel.

2402
02:50:31,680 --> 02:50:32,540
It's like...

2403
02:50:32,540 --> 02:50:34,600
This is just his parents' fault.

2404
02:50:35,660 --> 02:50:40,980
Humpty Dumpler is obsessed with taking things apart and
putting them back together.

2405
02:50:41,160 --> 02:50:44,300
His crimes at first were minor break-ins, leading to
small...

2406
02:50:45,200 --> 02:50:46,480
Like, you would...

2407
02:50:46,480 --> 02:50:48,920
The fuck's that fat Mario!

2408
02:50:49,540 --> 02:50:50,840
Holy shit, bro!

2409
02:50:51,260 --> 02:50:53,300
His name is already a Humphrey Dumpler!

2410
02:50:53,480 --> 02:50:55,200
You don't have to do that to him!

2411
02:50:56,720 --> 02:50:59,280
You set up for failure, yeah!

2412
02:51:01,000 --> 02:51:07,240
Functioning due to Dumpler's inability adequately
reassembled them after taking them apart, but soon his

2413
02:51:07,240 --> 02:51:14,280
obsession grew to the point that major disasters occurred in
Gotham, and Dumpler's crimes also extended to a gruesome

2414
02:51:14,280 --> 02:51:22,860
attempt to fix his abusive grandmother by the submarine whoa
and then tempting a frankenstein-like reassembly outcome he

2415
02:51:22,860 --> 02:51:29,880
is a model inmate his quiet nature imposing physique bearing
him to the madness surrounding him jesus he just wants to

2416
02:51:29,880 --> 02:51:35,960
fucking take things apart that's all he wants to do what did
he fucking debut 2003

2417
02:51:39,040 --> 02:51:46,540
ritualized child through this bro this person just had a
really fucking hard life His parents named him Humphrey

2418
02:51:46,540 --> 02:51:47,220
Dumpler!

2419
02:51:50,960 --> 02:51:52,740
What is that his fault?

2420
02:51:56,060 --> 02:51:58,620
His parents literally named him Humphrey Dumpler.

2421
02:52:00,500 --> 02:52:01,500
Alright, we gotta go.

2422
02:52:03,160 --> 02:52:06,100
We gotta go into the vent.

2423
02:52:06,740 --> 02:52:08,060
Apparently, there you go.

2424
02:52:08,180 --> 02:52:08,980
Vent time.

2425
02:52:09,480 --> 02:52:10,540
I'm gonna find some rats.

2426
02:52:12,120 --> 02:52:13,980
Where's the rat catcher?

2427
02:52:15,000 --> 02:52:16,160
No rats here.

2428
02:52:17,000 --> 02:52:18,700
Where's the fucking rats?

2429
02:52:23,160 --> 02:52:30,360
Oh my god there's no rats anywhere Look down in vent There's
another vent

2430
02:52:34,420 --> 02:52:45,910
Where It's a sewer No rats in here Scan the broken vent Is
that where the rat is?

2431
02:52:48,410 --> 02:52:56,350
Liars This vent in front of me Is that a vent?

2432
02:53:00,890 --> 02:53:04,010

2433
02:53:07,370 --> 02:53:09,070

2434
02:53:12,390 --> 02:53:14,630
we'll never figure it out

2435
02:53:20,710 --> 02:53:33,730
let's see we'll just go back downstairs and then wait
there's a person there bro i'm not even thinking about you

2436
02:53:33,730 --> 02:53:38,690
right now I want to kill this one guy that's underneath.

2437
02:53:41,230 --> 02:53:42,110
The rats?

2438
02:53:44,830 --> 02:53:46,530
Wait, this is a...

2439
02:53:46,530 --> 02:53:47,330
This is a sewer.

2440
02:53:47,650 --> 02:53:48,310
I should be coming here.

2441
02:53:48,350 --> 02:53:48,670
Oh, dang!

2442
02:53:48,750 --> 02:53:50,010
I found the trophy!

2443
02:53:54,340 --> 02:53:54,780
Nice.

2444
02:53:58,660 --> 02:54:00,380
Okay, now I need to remember how to get out of here.

2445
02:54:03,500 --> 02:54:04,160
This way?

2446
02:54:04,480 --> 02:54:04,900
No.

2447
02:54:05,500 --> 02:54:06,200
Where am I?

2448
02:54:09,760 --> 02:54:10,760
Oh no.

2449
02:54:12,680 --> 02:54:15,580
Okay, I thought like it's the cliff is just gonna start.

2450
02:54:15,980 --> 02:54:18,100
I literally thought like it's just gonna fall on me.

2451
02:54:18,180 --> 02:54:20,360
I was like, oh fuck, I might have fucked up.

2452
02:54:24,240 --> 02:54:24,760
Alright.

2453
02:54:25,980 --> 02:54:26,740
Where the fuck?

2454
02:54:27,360 --> 02:54:27,520
Where?

2455
02:54:28,940 --> 02:54:30,100
Where am I?

2456
02:54:31,680 --> 02:54:33,360
Where the fuck am I?

2457
02:54:33,920 --> 02:54:35,140

02:54:37,360 --> 02:54:37,880

2465
02:56:20,340 --> 02:56:35,340
look down here oh there it is we did it we beat the rats
once employed as an actual rat catcher in Gotham Otis

2466
02:56:35,340 --> 02:56:43,740
Flemingon soon started using his natural gift and affinity
with an ability to control rats to stage a variety of crimes

2467
02:56:43,740 --> 02:56:51,080
eventually his control over the vermin grew until he
threatened Gotham City with a variable army of rodents.

2468
02:56:51,540 --> 02:56:58,120
Incarcerated many times at Blackgate, he's able to do as
much damage within prisons and without using his loyal pets

2469
02:56:58,120 --> 02:57:05,340
to relay messages and transport materials outside the maze
of ventilation ducts that wind through the giant prison.

2470
02:57:05,500 --> 02:57:07,000
Oh wait, how tall is he though?

2471
02:57:07,360 --> 02:57:08,300
I put 11.

2472
02:57:11,240 --> 02:57:13,920
Oh, he lives in the sewer.

2473
02:57:14,220 --> 02:57:14,780
Poor guy.

2474
02:57:17,380 --> 02:57:18,580
Alright, you guys get to look at him.

2475
02:57:18,680 --> 02:57:19,420
I'm going to use the bathroom.

2476
02:57:19,520 --> 02:57:22,500
I'll bear back i'm

2477
03:00:18,200 --> 03:00:21,300

2478

2479
03:00:48,880 --> 03:00:51,140
Wait, how is he... Come on, I need to pull you in.

2480
03:00:51,620 --> 03:00:55,900
I will pull you into the water if it's the last thing I do.

2481
03:00:56,880 --> 03:00:57,980
Whoops, sorry, I couldn't aim.

2482
03:00:58,580 --> 03:01:00,800
Come on, you can't stay up there forever.

2483
03:01:02,040 --> 03:01:05,820
Oh my god, they actually programmed it, so I can't, like,
electrocute them.

2484
03:01:05,900 --> 03:01:06,800
That's so fucked up.

2485
03:01:07,680 --> 03:01:08,820
That's actually so fucked up.

2486
03:01:08,900 --> 03:01:10,080
I guess I'll do this then.

2487
03:01:13,160 --> 03:01:16,180
I guess I'll do it the hard way.

2488
03:01:17,900 --> 03:01:18,380
Okay.

2489
03:01:20,980 --> 03:01:24,600
I guess I'll do it this way.

2490
03:01:25,360 --> 03:01:28,780
Do you guys know they're planning on rebooting DC Comics
again?

2491
03:01:29,520 --> 03:01:33,600
I don't even know how many times they rebooted the fucking
DC lore.

2492
03:01:39,360 --> 03:01:40,080
Again?

2493
03:01:40,600 --> 03:01:41,740
Yeah, again.

2494
03:01:43,500 --> 03:01:44,840
Alright, goodbye.

2495
03:01:46,540 --> 03:01:48,860
How many times have they rebooted DC?

2496
03:01:48,880 --> 03:02:10,900
universe anyway all right let's see no no i'm not no i'm not
i just got your gift up there what did my sonic thing go i

2497
03:02:10,900 --> 03:02:13,080
was gonna say where did it go

2498
03:02:16,620 --> 03:02:21,080
no come on let me Get down!

2499
03:02:21,320 --> 03:02:21,740
Get down!

2500
03:02:25,650 --> 03:02:26,390
Yes, there you go.

2501
03:02:26,690 --> 03:02:27,270
Silent take down.

2502
03:02:28,550 --> 03:02:30,510
It's been rebooted five times.

2503
03:02:31,390 --> 03:02:33,230
I think that's like one of the biggest issues.

2504
03:02:35,090 --> 03:02:40,130
One of the biggest issues is just rebooted so many times
that you don't know which is the real like that.

2505
03:02:40,330 --> 03:02:44,950
Like, you know, it gets boring because it's the... How many
times are we going to watch Batman's parents die?

2506
03:02:46,670 --> 03:02:47,830
Like at that rate.

2507
03:02:49,070 --> 03:03:01,450
How many times do we watch his die I'm gonna go goodbye

2508
03:03:04,860 --> 03:03:18,660
new new new new 52 I swear to God if this one guy ruins at
all.

2509
03:03:28,730 --> 03:03:31,590
They better not wreak on badmints underwear.

2510
03:03:35,290 --> 03:03:35,710
I swear.

2511
03:03:36,110 --> 03:03:38,030
If they take away his underwear, I'm out.

2512
03:03:40,410 --> 03:03:41,410
I want him dead.

2513
03:03:52,780 --> 03:03:53,520
The fuck is...

2514
03:03:53,520 --> 03:03:55,220
You didn't do anything?

2515
03:03:57,180 --> 03:03:59,000
You didn't even do anything either.

2516
03:03:59,140 --> 03:04:00,380
You can't blame that on me.

2517
03:04:01,520 --> 03:04:02,180
What the fuck?

2518
03:04:03,420 --> 03:04:04,380
What the fuck?

2519
03:04:04,540 --> 03:04:06,400
You're a little tight.

2520
03:04:06,700 --> 03:04:07,320
Wait, what?

2521
03:04:07,640 --> 03:04:09,620
I thought you were against this, Ivy.

2522
03:04:10,640 --> 03:04:11,640
Shall I give her another?

2523
03:04:12,440 --> 03:04:14,460
I think she wants it.

2524
03:04:20,190 --> 03:04:26,050
I was hoping for a 40-foot killer plant, but you don't
always get what you want, do you?

2525
03:04:26,550 --> 03:04:27,230
Oh, shit.

2526
03:04:27,270 --> 03:04:28,330
Is she beefed up now?

2527
03:04:28,710 --> 03:04:30,790
Is she going to be a domi-mommy now?

2528
03:04:33,820 --> 03:04:39,520
It's like those like the, you know, like those like
bodybuilders, oh my gosh, the wood Women bodybuilding

2529
03:04:39,520 --> 03:04:42,020
competitions go so fucking hard.

2530
03:04:44,320 --> 03:04:45,020
Oh my god.

2531
03:04:45,640 --> 03:04:47,580
She's gonna be like those women bodybuilders.

2532
03:04:51,230 --> 03:04:51,850
Where do I go?

2533
03:04:52,410 --> 03:04:53,270
Collect plants.

2534
03:04:53,470 --> 03:04:54,690
How do I get out of here then?

2535
03:04:55,590 --> 03:04:56,450
What do I do?

2536
03:04:57,070 --> 03:04:59,010
Can I just cut it with my batter at him?

2537
03:04:59,250 --> 03:05:00,650
Maybe my fist can cut it.

2538
03:05:07,700 --> 03:05:08,200
Where the fuck?

2539
03:05:08,300 --> 03:05:09,900
Where do I go then?

2540
03:05:10,220 --> 03:05:10,800
Where do I go back?

2541
03:05:17,610 --> 03:05:18,330
Drop down?

2542
03:05:19,430 --> 03:05:20,190
There's a down?

2543
03:05:20,210 --> 03:05:20,870
Oh,

2544
03:05:27,090 --> 03:05:27,870
there's a down.

2545
03:05:31,010 --> 03:05:34,030
Sorry, I forgot where down is.

2546
03:05:35,850 --> 03:05:36,470
Alright, nice.

2547
03:05:36,850 --> 03:05:37,950
Go up.

2548
03:05:38,550 --> 03:05:39,470
This way.

2549
03:05:41,130 --> 03:05:43,530
Bro, I swear, if she is not...

2550
03:05:43,530 --> 03:05:49,790
If she is not swole as fuck, like, the women bodybuilder
competition, then they've...

2551
03:05:49,790 --> 03:05:51,470
Then they've missed a point.

2552
03:05:51,590 --> 03:05:52,410
They missed a mark.

2553
03:05:53,450 --> 03:05:54,090
Okay.

2554
03:05:54,650 --> 03:05:57,130
Titan must be having a different effect on Ivy.

2555
03:05:57,830 --> 03:05:58,910
Her plants are growing.

2556
03:05:59,670 --> 03:06:00,930
They'll soon be out of control.

2557
03:06:08,330 --> 03:06:11,030
If she's not extra hot, I'm done.

2558
03:06:12,610 --> 03:06:15,750
Oh, no!

2559
03:06:16,550 --> 03:06:17,070
Wait, are they...

2560
03:06:17,070 --> 03:06:18,310
Oh, no, did they kill them?

2561
03:06:18,510 --> 03:06:19,170
Oh, thank God.

2562
03:06:19,270 --> 03:06:20,390
Okay, I was gonna say...

2563
03:06:20,390 --> 03:06:21,650
I thought they were gonna make them swole.

2564
03:06:22,050 --> 03:06:26,250
That pod appears to contain similar spores to the ones Ivy
used to attack Gotham last year.

2565
03:06:26,550 --> 03:06:26,790
That is...

2566
03:06:26,790 --> 03:06:27,430
They're deadly.

2567
03:06:28,490 --> 03:06:40,150
I just Hit it Why can't I make a flame Bad a flame thrower A
bat flamethrower I should be able to make a bat Ow Oh it

2568
03:06:40,150 --> 03:06:46,230

2569
03:06:49,300 --> 03:06:53,640

03:07:02,000 --> 03:07:05,220
Just punch the plant, just punch the plant, Batman.

2573
03:07:06,240 --> 03:07:07,360
Wait, okay, he has XP!

2574
03:07:07,700 --> 03:07:08,700
I'm gonna punch all the plants.

2575
03:07:10,500 --> 03:07:10,900
I guess.

2576
03:07:11,620 --> 03:07:13,200
Fuck the environment, but in-game.

2577
03:07:14,720 --> 03:07:15,320
There we go.

2578
03:07:15,520 --> 03:07:17,500
Oh my god, oh, it's just 25 XP.

2579
03:07:17,680 --> 03:07:18,660
It's not that much, actually.

2580
03:07:19,780 --> 03:07:20,660
Fist the...

2581
03:07:20,660 --> 03:07:20,980
No!

2582
03:07:24,300 --> 03:07:26,480
Batman just fist the plant.

2583
03:07:28,360 --> 03:07:28,800
Batman.

2584
03:07:28,900 --> 03:07:33,020
Why so serious, Batman?

2585
03:07:33,500 --> 03:07:35,140
Just fist a plant.

2586
03:07:37,660 --> 03:07:38,900
There we go.

2587
03:07:39,440 --> 03:07:41,520
But it adds up, Toki.

2588
03:07:41,980 --> 03:07:45,920
No, I feel like this is just some fucking somebody sick
fetish right now.

2589
03:07:47,760 --> 03:07:48,880
Oh, shit.

2590
03:07:50,600 --> 03:07:51,000
All right.

2591
03:07:52,620 --> 03:07:55,060
Like how it kills him.

2592
03:08:04,360 --> 03:08:13,540
all right let's see you know i realized i found out that
before like disney bought marvel and made all the fucking

2593
03:08:13,540 --> 03:08:23,340
disney movies uh okay i gotta go this way right um the only
popular characters in marvel was like spider-man and was

2594
03:08:23,340 --> 03:08:30,680
just spider-man the x-men and wolver i mean wolverine is
practically a fucking x-men and like dc basically had the

2595
03:08:30,680 --> 03:08:35,540
fucking monopoly really for DC hero for the hero market.

2596
03:08:41,270 --> 03:08:44,910
And now everything has to be a fucking emce- the- was it?

2597
03:08:45,290 --> 03:08:47,950
Has to be like a- a universe- What was the word?

2598
03:08:48,050 --> 03:08:48,870
A cinematic universe?

2599
03:08:49,030 --> 03:08:50,990
Now everything has to be a goddamn cinematic universe.

2600
03:08:51,390 --> 03:08:52,830
I'm so tired of cinematic universe.

2601
03:08:52,930 --> 03:08:53,630
Just let it end.

2602
03:08:54,870 --> 03:08:56,210
Let it end!

2603
03:08:57,570 --> 03:09:00,230
I feel like downstairs is poison.

2604
03:09:07,780 --> 03:09:07,980
Whoops.

2605
03:09:13,020 --> 03:09:25,200
I'm tired of MCU's I'm tired of cinematic universes Let
things end Who gives a fuck about nostalgia I don't care

2606
03:09:34,680 --> 03:09:36,080

2607
03:09:36,580 --> 03:09:41,900
Oh back here, okay Where do I go there?

2608
03:09:43,200 --> 03:09:44,300
Can I climb on TV?

2609
03:09:45,600 --> 03:09:48,960
Wee Guys, I can't climb on TVs.

2610
03:09:54,750 --> 03:09:54,910
Oh, wait.

2611
03:09:54,910 --> 03:09:55,730
I'm up here now.

2612
03:09:55,950 --> 03:09:56,890
How did I get up here?

2613
03:09:57,490 --> 03:09:58,310
Where am I?

2614
03:09:58,510 --> 03:10:00,890
How did I get up here?

2615
03:10:01,410 --> 03:10:02,190
What do I do?

2616
03:10:08,630 --> 03:10:08,990
Oh.

2617
03:10:10,050 --> 03:10:10,550
Balcony.

2618
03:10:10,850 --> 03:10:11,070
Okay.

2619
03:10:11,230 --> 03:10:11,950
I looked around.

2620
03:10:13,370 --> 03:10:13,670
Alright.

2621
03:10:15,290 --> 03:10:16,230
Question mark.

2622
03:10:17,190 --> 03:10:18,030
Maybe here?

2623
03:10:19,830 --> 03:10:21,250
I head across here?

2624
03:10:21,410 --> 03:10:22,130
No, that's a podium.

2625
03:10:22,290 --> 03:10:22,910
God damn it.

2626
03:10:22,930 --> 03:10:23,570
That's a podium.

2627
03:10:24,130 --> 03:10:25,310
That's a fucking...

2628
03:10:25,330 --> 03:10:25,850
Chloe.

2629
03:10:29,230 --> 03:10:30,590
Where do I drop?

2630
03:10:30,810 --> 03:10:31,770
Oh, I can drop here.

2631
03:10:34,310 --> 03:10:35,090
Alright, nice.

2632
03:10:35,730 --> 03:10:36,430
Can I punch...

2633
03:10:36,430 --> 03:10:37,170
Can I fist this flat?

2634
03:10:37,410 --> 03:10:37,750
No, wait.

2635
03:10:37,770 --> 03:10:38,270
Oh, this way.

2636
03:10:40,890 --> 03:10:41,310
Okay.

2637
03:10:42,190 --> 03:10:43,290
Go up here.

2638
03:10:45,190 --> 03:10:47,070
I'm tired of nostalgia bait.

2639
03:10:48,090 --> 03:10:48,870
It's so stupid.

2640
03:10:48,910 --> 03:10:51,690
Did you guys know they released new Star Wars stuff again?

2641
03:10:52,830 --> 03:10:54,030
I'm so tired.

2642
03:10:57,870 --> 03:10:58,410
Please.

2643
03:11:00,630 --> 03:11:02,270
Where do I go?

2644
03:11:02,490 --> 03:11:02,790
Here?

2645
03:11:03,130 --> 03:11:03,790
I guess so.

2646
03:11:05,490 --> 03:11:08,330
I've lost track of how many fucking...

2647
03:11:09,710 --> 03:11:10,250
Uh...

2648
03:11:10,250 --> 03:11:11,010
What the fuck?

2649
03:11:11,570 --> 03:11:14,790
I lost track of how many fucking Star Wars shit they've made
already.

2650
03:11:16,510 --> 03:11:17,190
Maybe here?

2651
03:11:18,950 --> 03:11:19,490
Yeah.

2652
03:11:19,710 --> 03:11:20,810
I was like looking at Disney.

2653
03:11:21,210 --> 03:11:21,750
Please!

2654
03:11:22,010 --> 03:11:22,990
Is that a fuck?

2655
03:11:23,090 --> 03:11:23,750
Okay, nice.

2656
03:11:23,950 --> 03:11:24,570
That counts.

2657
03:11:26,690 --> 03:11:28,050
Okay, that counts.

2658
03:11:28,270 --> 03:11:29,010
I take this.

2659
03:11:34,160 --> 03:11:35,440
This way.

2660
03:11:37,060 --> 03:11:37,780
That counts.

2661
03:11:38,120 --> 03:11:38,420
No!

2662
03:11:40,860 --> 03:11:42,140
Let me exploit!

2663
03:11:43,800 --> 03:11:44,660
Oh, hey.

2664
03:11:44,940 --> 03:11:46,080
Let me exploit it.

2665
03:11:46,360 --> 03:11:46,860
Oh, nice.

2666
03:11:47,120 --> 03:11:47,660
That works.

2667
03:11:52,240 --> 03:11:52,880
Yay!

2668
03:11:55,220 --> 03:11:56,240
That works.

2669
03:11:56,420 --> 03:11:56,780
That's nice.

2670
03:11:57,900 --> 03:11:59,100
Oh, hey guys.

2671
03:12:01,400 --> 03:12:02,900
I figured you'd be here about now.

2672
03:12:03,480 --> 03:12:04,600
What's the deal with the plants?

2673
03:12:05,240 --> 03:12:05,920
It's complicated.

2674
03:12:06,900 --> 03:12:07,560
Let me guess.

2675
03:12:07,980 --> 03:12:08,760
Poison Ivy.

2676
03:12:09,360 --> 03:12:10,420
She teamed up with Joker.

2677
03:12:11,180 --> 03:12:11,760
All that matters.

2678
03:12:11,800 --> 03:12:13,220
I have no idea how to do this legit.

2679
03:12:13,360 --> 03:12:15,500
I'm glad that I've exploited my way into this.

2680
03:12:15,720 --> 03:12:17,000
There's always a butt, isn't there?

2681
03:12:17,440 --> 03:12:18,700
Where do you keep Killer Croc?

2682
03:12:19,040 --> 03:12:21,420
I found a door in the sewers, but it's sealed shut.

2683
03:12:22,020 --> 03:12:24,500
That monster's got his own special cell.

2684
03:12:26,980 --> 03:12:32,940
treatment elevator goes right down to an old sewer he just
dropped meat down there every day or so and try to forget

2685
03:12:32,940 --> 03:12:38,800
about it it's locked off more security than the joker you
won't get in without the warden's permission he has the

2686
03:12:38,800 --> 03:12:45,660
codes i have the codes thanks cash stay here and do not go
near the plants how do you like not go near they're

2687
03:12:45,660 --> 03:12:56,040

oh their people their companies are too scared to do

2688
03:12:56,040 --> 03:13:00,480
anything but nostalgia bait because they don't want to make
anything new they're too scared of spending money that

2689
03:13:00,480 --> 03:13:14,400
they're losing money it's so stupid okay okay can access to
killer crocs there via intensive treatment how to get out of

2690
03:13:14,400 --> 03:13:23,180

here it's so dumb Because they're too scared of spending

2691
03:13:23,180 --> 03:13:31,420
money On experimenting That they end up making it worse So
like, what's the point?

2692
03:13:33,780 --> 03:13:42,320
I don't get out of here now I've already exploded my way to
here But now I don't know how to get there I guess like This

2693
03:13:42,320 --> 03:13:42,840

2694
03:13:48,600 --> 03:13:49,640
I'm lost

2695
03:13:57,080 --> 03:14:05,160
Um Um Whoops Yeah!

2696
03:14:09,020 --> 03:14:09,960
Yes!

2697
03:14:11,140 --> 03:14:12,880
That's what I like!

2698
03:14:17,830 --> 03:14:20,270
I did it!

2699
03:14:21,990 --> 03:14:23,290
I figured it out.

2700
03:14:24,210 --> 03:14:25,470
The cheese.

2701
03:14:27,930 --> 03:14:31,870
Cheezed my way out, and that's how I like it.

2702
03:14:32,510 --> 03:14:33,470
Alright, grapple here.

2703
03:14:37,520 --> 03:14:38,200
Nice.

2704
03:14:39,300 --> 03:14:41,240
That was just that easy.

2705
03:14:49,500 --> 03:14:52,740
Like you said, this island has been well and truly buried.

2706
03:14:52,900 --> 03:14:53,440
Oh well.

2707
03:14:55,880 --> 03:14:57,140
We got to go.

03:14:58,860 --> 03:14:59,740
Over here.

2709
03:14:59,880 --> 03:15:02,820
I guess I can go from the right side.

2710
03:15:02,980 --> 03:15:03,900
I'll go right side.

2711
03:15:04,600 --> 03:15:04,880
Whee!

2712
03:15:05,700 --> 03:15:10,240
Any more plants that would like the back treatment?

Oh, this one plant.

2716
03:15:16,340 --> 03:15:17,660
You thought you could get away.

2717
03:15:19,100 --> 03:15:20,860
You thought you could get away.

2718
03:15:21,520 --> 03:15:21,640

All right.

2725
03:15:35,620 --> 03:15:36,360
Sit this way.

2726
03:15:36,500 --> 03:15:36,980
Okay, here.

2727
03:15:37,540 --> 03:15:39,340
I might even have 50% of this game.

2728
03:15:39,440 --> 03:15:40,240
What the fuck?

2729
03:15:40,880 --> 03:15:42,280
Why are they wearing jackets now?

2730
03:15:43,480 --> 03:15:44,120
See?

2731
03:15:46,420 --> 03:15:47,500

2732
03:15:47,880 --> 03:15:49,000
The Joker's great!

2733
03:15:49,720 --> 03:15:54,400
Their men was cold and the Joker gave them jackets, guys.

2734
03:15:54,760 --> 03:15:55,480
Look at that.

2735
03:15:55,620 --> 03:15:56,920
Now it's bowling time.

2736
03:15:57,760 --> 03:15:58,080
Bowling!

2737
03:16:00,560 --> 03:16:01,200
Nice.

2738
03:16:01,480 --> 03:16:01,580
Three.

2739
03:16:01,960 --> 03:16:02,700
I take this.

2740
03:16:04,120 --> 03:16:05,060
Look at that.

2741
03:16:06,200 --> 03:16:08,200
Joker is so considerate, guys.

2742
03:16:09,160 --> 03:16:12,140
They literally gave them jackets because he doesn't want
them to be cold.

2743
03:16:14,840 --> 03:16:16,540
Your boss would never...

2744
03:16:16,540 --> 03:16:17,260
He's so nice.

2745
03:16:17,340 --> 03:16:18,100
I know, right?

2746
03:16:18,340 --> 03:16:19,300
He's so nice!

2747
03:16:21,260 --> 03:16:22,300
Nah, that's fucking right.

2748
03:16:24,620 --> 03:16:26,640
I gotta make sure, like...

2749
03:16:26,640 --> 03:16:29,540
Oh, nice, I took his... I took his fucking taser all the
way.

2750
03:16:30,160 --> 03:16:33,620
Oh, I wanted to use the weapon for that one time, but not
the other time.

2751
03:16:37,180 --> 03:16:38,060
Okay, nice.

2752
03:16:40,300 --> 03:16:42,240
Okay, I'll counter that.

2753
03:16:44,280 --> 03:16:46,060
How can I throw my batter-ems?

2754
03:16:48,120 --> 03:16:49,380
Wait, how did he pick that up?

2755
03:16:53,330 --> 03:16:53,890
Alright, nope.

2756
03:16:54,590 --> 03:16:55,250
That's fucking right.

2757
03:16:55,350 --> 03:16:55,670
Counter.

2758
03:16:56,010 --> 03:16:56,930
How did I counter that?

2759
03:16:57,010 --> 03:16:57,390
No!

2760
03:16:58,910 --> 03:16:59,510
Oh, shit.

2761
03:16:59,770 --> 03:17:00,090
No, no, no, no, no.

2762
03:17:00,430 --> 03:17:01,010
That's fucking right.

2763
03:17:01,130 --> 03:17:02,030
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2764
03:17:02,070 --> 03:17:02,590
Get away from me!

2765
03:17:04,750 --> 03:17:05,050
Okay.

2766
03:17:05,970 --> 03:17:07,190
Now I'm just gonna go.

2767
03:17:07,330 --> 03:17:13,310
Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop,
boop, boop.

2768
03:17:13,310 --> 03:17:14,650
He can die eventually, right?

2769
03:17:16,290 --> 03:17:16,690
That's right.

2770
03:17:17,510 --> 03:17:18,410
He'll die eventually.

2771
03:17:19,690 --> 03:17:21,890
There's no way you can live through all these battle radons.

2772
03:17:22,550 --> 03:17:23,470
Simple physics!

2773
03:17:24,550 --> 03:17:27,070
Okay, now I'm just gonna...

2774
03:17:27,070 --> 03:17:28,790
Now you're just pissing me off.

2775
03:17:30,810 --> 03:17:31,350
Okay.

2776
03:17:32,150 --> 03:17:34,130
You've lived long enough.

2777
03:17:36,050 --> 03:17:37,670
You've lived long enough.

2778
03:17:40,850 --> 03:17:42,150
Now I see it.

2779
03:17:42,210 --> 03:17:43,250
Now you don't...

2780
03:17:47,300 --> 03:17:49,480
There was a sniper up on the roof.

2781
03:17:49,580 --> 03:17:51,320
He got there somehow.

2782
03:17:52,060 --> 03:17:52,880
I'll find a way.

2783
03:17:53,060 --> 03:17:53,820
Where's the sniper?

2784
03:17:56,120 --> 03:17:57,020
This guy?

2785
03:17:58,820 --> 03:17:59,940
Oh, that guy is the sniper.

2786
03:18:00,280 --> 03:18:00,500
Okay.

2787
03:18:00,960 --> 03:18:02,220
I mean, I can literally just go.

2788
03:18:03,540 --> 03:18:04,560
I can just climb.

2789
03:18:05,960 --> 03:18:07,140
Batman, climb.

2790
03:18:08,700 --> 03:18:09,740
I can't just climb.

2791
03:18:10,760 --> 03:18:11,140
Alright.

2792
03:18:12,240 --> 03:18:13,140
That's not fair.

2793
03:18:16,180 --> 03:18:16,780
Alright.

2794
03:18:17,140 --> 03:18:18,740
I thought I could just climb.

2795
03:18:19,580 --> 03:18:27,580
understand you mean i can't just climb everything who would
have thought i can't just climb everything

2796
03:18:30,980 --> 03:18:47,940
goodbye he's not a spy there we no oh wait no i can't just
get up there what if i line this i'm there must be an

2797
03:18:47,940 --> 03:18:50,600
exploit Oh, he sees me.

2798
03:18:51,180 --> 03:18:51,920
No, he doesn't.

2799
03:18:53,740 --> 03:18:55,120
Okay, there must be...

2800
03:18:55,120 --> 03:18:56,500
There's always an exploit.

2801
03:18:58,960 --> 03:19:00,540
There's always an exploit.

2802
03:19:01,460 --> 03:19:02,220
God damn it.

2803
03:19:02,860 --> 03:19:04,260
How the fuck do I get across?

2804
03:19:05,970 --> 03:19:07,580
Go up the tower?

2805
03:19:08,140 --> 03:19:08,860
This tower?

2806
03:19:09,360 --> 03:19:11,020
Okay, this must be the tower.

2807
03:19:13,560 --> 03:19:13,820
Ew.

2808
03:19:18,040 --> 03:19:18,660
Okay.

2809
03:19:20,160 --> 03:19:21,260
Oh, there is.

2810
03:19:22,000 --> 03:19:23,880
There's always an exploit.

2811
03:19:27,660 --> 03:19:30,280
I did not see that!

2812
03:19:31,680 --> 03:19:32,780
Holy shit!

2813
03:19:34,240 --> 03:19:37,240
Joker, you need to invest in better goons.

2814
03:19:38,700 --> 03:19:39,820
They're not gonna lie.

2815
03:19:40,960 --> 03:19:43,160
I love 2010 NPCs.

2816
03:19:43,720 --> 03:19:45,180
It made me feel so smart.

2817
03:19:48,750 --> 03:19:49,950
It's dark out.

2818
03:19:50,390 --> 03:19:51,870
Then don't be a fucking sniper!

2819
03:19:52,650 --> 03:19:53,730
Oh, Shit.

2820
03:19:54,490 --> 03:19:55,330
Structural integrity.

2821
03:19:56,390 --> 03:19:57,750
I'm seeing seismic activity.

2822
03:20:00,120 --> 03:20:01,460
Ivy's plants are taking hold.

2823
03:20:01,960 --> 03:20:04,900
I've got to stop them before the entire island is under her
control.

2824
03:20:06,580 --> 03:20:11,180
If she is not swole as fuck, then this game's a 9 out of 10.

2825
03:20:12,180 --> 03:20:13,140
No swole Ivy.

2826
03:20:15,000 --> 03:20:16,020
It doesn't make sense.

2827
03:20:16,120 --> 03:20:18,220
Why is she not swole, but the goons are?

2828
03:20:18,700 --> 03:20:19,740
I don't understand.

2829
03:20:23,440 --> 03:20:24,420
Wait, what's over here?

2830
03:20:28,190 --> 03:20:28,970
Oh, no.

2831
03:20:29,150 --> 03:20:30,310
Am I gonna be lost again?

2832
03:20:34,690 --> 03:20:36,210
I think I'm gonna be lost again.

2833
03:20:40,310 --> 03:20:42,190
Okay, I need to go here.

2834
03:20:42,670 --> 03:20:42,990
Oh, my God.

2835
03:20:43,110 --> 03:20:43,970
I'm gonna be lost again.

2836
03:20:46,090 --> 03:20:49,010
If she is, I swear I'm gonna lose a Batman.

2837
03:20:54,010 --> 03:20:55,370
Plants can be swole.

2838
03:20:55,590 --> 03:20:56,910
What the fuck are you talking about?

2839
03:20:57,010 --> 03:20:58,230
There's thick plants.

2840
03:21:04,360 --> 03:21:05,880
Plants can be plump.

2841
03:21:09,870 --> 03:21:22,110
okay let's see i need to figure out how to do this oh my god

2843
03:21:40,200 --> 03:21:43,500

2844
03:21:49,840 --> 03:21:50,950
All right.

2845
03:21:57,860 --> 03:22:00,470
Wait, no more inverted takedowns?

2846
03:22:01,020 --> 03:22:03,680
Wait, did he fucked up all the Gorgos?

2847
03:22:05,720 --> 03:22:06,460
Ow.

2848
03:22:09,140 --> 03:22:09,480
Ow.

2849
03:22:10,840 --> 03:22:11,900
Nope, nope.

2850
03:22:12,840 --> 03:22:15,600
There's no way he exploded this one, right?

2851
03:22:17,600 --> 03:22:20,090
He exploded this one.

2852
03:22:23,440 --> 03:22:25,030
There's no...

2853
03:22:28,240 --> 03:22:30,780
Whoa, he doesn't know.

2854
03:22:31,940 --> 03:22:34,080
He doesn't know.

2855
03:22:36,900 --> 03:22:40,780
There's no way they saw me, guys.

2856
03:22:42,060 --> 03:22:43,400
Watch this.

2857
03:22:44,880 --> 03:22:46,020
Bowling time.

2858
03:22:48,160 --> 03:22:48,560
Two.

2859
03:22:52,960 --> 03:22:53,640
Okay, there you go.

2860
03:22:54,900 --> 03:22:56,600
There's no way they saw me here.

2861
03:22:59,460 --> 03:23:00,640
What the fuck?

2862
03:23:00,780 --> 03:23:01,380
I'm in the corner!

2863
03:23:02,380 --> 03:23:03,560
This is...

2864
03:23:03,560 --> 03:23:05,920
This is fucking legal!

2865
03:23:07,660 --> 03:23:09,540
Who shot me?

2866
03:23:09,920 --> 03:23:10,500
Oh!

2867
03:23:14,700 --> 03:23:16,140
Oh my gosh.

2868
03:23:17,120 --> 03:23:18,200
Oh, dude, no.

2869
03:23:18,300 --> 03:23:19,860
I can't believe it.

2870
03:23:20,720 --> 03:23:23,060
I can't believe they saw me.

2871
03:23:25,300 --> 03:23:26,440
Okay, this time I got this.

2872
03:23:26,460 --> 03:23:27,860
I can do this.

2873
03:23:28,820 --> 03:23:30,900
I can do this this time.

2874
03:23:30,940 --> 03:23:32,400
I don't need no gargoyle.

2875
03:23:35,300 --> 03:23:37,160
I don't need no gargoyles.

2876
03:23:37,920 --> 03:23:40,300
The gargoyles are not a crutch for me.

2877
03:23:42,900 --> 03:23:44,840
It's not a crutch, I swear.

2878
03:23:48,260 --> 03:23:50,340
I can't believe they're learning.

2879
03:23:50,800 --> 03:23:52,920
I can't believe the AIs are learning.

2880
03:23:53,080 --> 03:23:54,080
This isn't fair.

2881
03:23:56,040 --> 03:23:57,860
How do you afford all these guns?

2882
03:24:00,180 --> 03:24:01,140
There you go.

2883
03:24:02,060 --> 03:24:03,960
God damn it, now I actually have to stealth.

2884
03:24:08,180 --> 03:24:10,000
Can I just, like, keep killing them here?

2885
03:24:10,840 --> 03:24:11,520
an event

2886
03:24:16,160 --> 03:24:27,090
it's not a crutch i swear okay wait

2887
03:24:31,620 --> 03:24:41,280

2888
03:24:41,280 --> 03:24:50,280
okay they'll have to turn around someday right not everybody
totally better my Thank you.

2889
03:24:50,300 --> 03:24:50,900
Thank you.

2890
03:24:51,440 --> 03:24:52,000
That's okay.

2891
03:24:52,120 --> 03:24:53,780
They have to turn around soon, right?

2892
03:24:55,000 --> 03:24:55,680
Come on.

2893
03:24:55,880 --> 03:24:56,940
Turn around.

2894
03:24:57,380 --> 03:24:58,660
Turn around.

2895
03:25:01,900 --> 03:25:02,180
Alright.

2896
03:25:03,100 --> 03:25:03,560
That's fine.

2897
03:25:05,900 --> 03:25:06,400
It's fine.

2898
03:25:06,620 --> 03:25:09,180
As long as Joker doesn't ghost me again, we're fine.

2899
03:25:10,120 --> 03:25:11,620
Because then he doesn't do any ghosting.

2900
03:25:12,300 --> 03:25:13,120
Oh my god, look at that.

2901
03:25:13,320 --> 03:25:14,240
They're back to back.

2902
03:25:15,060 --> 03:25:16,120
They're covered his back.

2903
03:25:16,200 --> 03:25:17,220
What are these AIs?

2904
03:25:17,280 --> 03:25:18,220
He's so smart.

2905
03:25:18,380 --> 03:25:18,560
Oh.

2906
03:25:19,460 --> 03:25:20,400
He doesn't see me right?

2907
03:25:20,880 --> 03:25:21,760
Oh no, he doesn't see.

2908
03:25:21,880 --> 03:25:22,800
Definitely doesn't see me.

2909
03:25:23,360 --> 03:25:23,800
Alright, come on.

2910
03:25:23,840 --> 03:25:24,260
Come up.

2911
03:25:25,080 --> 03:25:25,660
Come up.

2912
03:25:26,400 --> 03:25:27,200
That's fucking right.

2913
03:25:28,080 --> 03:25:29,340
Go closer to your friend.

2914
03:25:30,040 --> 03:25:30,320
Oh fuck.

2915
03:25:30,500 --> 03:25:31,120
No, that's not cool.

2916
03:25:31,920 --> 03:25:32,580
That's not fair.

2917
03:25:33,240 --> 03:25:34,460
Why are you over here?

2918
03:25:36,500 --> 03:25:36,980
Oh, okay.

2919
03:25:40,370 --> 03:25:40,490
Ooh!

2920
03:25:41,650 --> 03:25:42,390
There's a seed.

2921
03:25:43,030 --> 03:25:43,410
There's a seed.

2922
03:25:44,630 --> 03:25:45,690
There's a seed.

2923
03:25:52,160 --> 03:25:52,880
It's okay!

2924
03:25:58,530 --> 03:25:59,250
Okay.

2925
03:26:06,170 --> 03:26:06,810
Back up, Bakko.

2926
03:26:09,170 --> 03:26:11,190
It's not a crutch, I swear!

2927
03:26:15,490 --> 03:26:18,150
The gargoyles are not a crutch!

2928
03:26:19,950 --> 03:26:21,610
I swear to God!

2929
03:26:22,510 --> 03:26:22,770
Okay.

2930
03:26:23,650 --> 03:26:23,990
Alright.

2931
03:26:24,550 --> 03:26:25,830
We can do this.

2932
03:26:27,750 --> 03:26:27,890
Alright.

2933
03:26:28,110 --> 03:26:28,430
Oh!

2934
03:26:28,630 --> 03:26:28,770
Oh!

2935
03:26:28,870 --> 03:26:29,410
I have an idea!

2936
03:26:29,830 --> 03:26:30,210
I have an idea!

2937
03:26:30,450 --> 03:26:30,790
I have an idea!

2938
03:26:32,050 --> 03:26:32,250
Okay.

2939
03:26:34,250 --> 03:26:35,450
I'm gonna tag this.

2940
03:26:36,450 --> 03:26:37,370
I have an idea.

2941
03:26:38,430 --> 03:26:39,450
I have an idea.

2942
03:26:40,250 --> 03:26:40,650
Guys!

2943
03:26:41,330 --> 03:26:42,490
I figured it out.

2944
03:26:42,670 --> 03:26:44,310
I'm gonna set up a trap.

2945
03:26:45,570 --> 03:26:47,250
Okay, and then...

2946
03:26:47,250 --> 03:26:48,210
And then...

2947
03:26:48,870 --> 03:26:49,350
Okay.

2948
03:26:52,910 --> 03:26:54,690
Wait, I can't use this here.

2949
03:26:55,370 --> 03:26:57,230
Wait, I can't- I can't- okay.

2950
03:26:57,770 --> 03:26:58,470
It's okay.

2951
03:26:58,870 --> 03:26:59,590
It's fine.

2952
03:26:59,890 --> 03:27:05,250
I just realized I cannot use the explosives while in the
vent, but it's okay.

2953
03:27:05,370 --> 03:27:06,690
He walked into my trap.

2954
03:27:07,410 --> 03:27:08,990
He walked into my trap.

2955
03:27:09,330 --> 03:27:10,550
He was alone.

2956
03:27:12,270 --> 03:27:12,950
There we go.

2957
03:27:13,310 --> 03:27:14,230
It's that easy.

2958
03:27:16,050 --> 03:27:16,930
My trap.

2959
03:27:18,170 --> 03:27:19,150
Being alone.

2960
03:27:24,390 --> 03:27:25,810
Alright, don't worry.

2961
03:27:25,970 --> 03:27:26,310
Don't worry.

2962
03:27:26,450 --> 03:27:27,390
He doesn't know.

2963
03:27:30,010 --> 03:27:31,930
There's no way he knows.

2964
03:27:32,290 --> 03:27:32,530
Yes!

2965
03:27:36,250 --> 03:27:37,970
There's no way.

2966
03:27:38,670 --> 03:27:40,870
There's no way they knew.

2967
03:27:42,690 --> 03:27:43,450
There's no way.

2968
03:27:43,810 --> 03:27:44,990
He's alone!

2969
03:27:45,310 --> 03:27:46,490
You're alone!

2970
03:27:47,330 --> 03:27:48,490
You're alone!

2971
03:27:49,410 --> 03:27:51,290
I'm coming for you!

2972
03:27:51,850 --> 03:27:53,030
You have no friends!

2973
03:27:53,350 --> 03:27:54,590
This is the perfect cover!

2974
03:27:57,710 --> 03:27:58,230
Oh shit.

2975
03:27:58,330 --> 03:27:59,110
Wait, that's not great.

2976
03:27:59,390 --> 03:27:59,790
Never mind.

2977
03:27:59,930 --> 03:28:00,330
Never mind.

2978
03:28:00,510 --> 03:28:00,750
Yes.

2979
03:28:00,810 --> 03:28:01,450
friends now.

2980
03:28:02,570 --> 03:28:03,910
He has friends now, guys.

2981
03:28:04,170 --> 03:28:04,870
That's not good.

2982
03:28:05,430 --> 03:28:06,390
Wait, is it bowling time?

2983
03:28:07,290 --> 03:28:08,650
Wait, wait, it's bowling time.

2984
03:28:09,470 --> 03:28:09,730
Okay.

2985
03:28:11,890 --> 03:28:12,290
Whoa.

2986
03:28:13,710 --> 03:28:16,490
No, no, don't turn back.

2987
03:28:16,690 --> 03:28:17,390
No, no, no.

2988
03:28:17,530 --> 03:28:18,150
Don't turn back.

2989
03:28:18,250 --> 03:28:19,030
Don't huddle up.

2990
03:28:19,630 --> 03:28:20,710
This is not among us.

2991
03:28:20,910 --> 03:28:21,550
Stop huddling.

2992
03:28:21,750 --> 03:28:22,550
It's not fun.

2993
03:28:23,570 --> 03:28:25,210
Oh, hey, look at my legs, though.

2994
03:28:27,530 --> 03:28:28,330
Holy shit.

2995
03:28:28,470 --> 03:28:30,330
Look at how thick my thighs are, though.

2996
03:28:30,810 --> 03:28:36,450
Hooker hired the finest goons with exactly 45 degrees of...

2997
03:28:36,450 --> 03:28:36,930
What?

2998
03:28:37,490 --> 03:28:37,830
No!

2999
03:28:38,050 --> 03:28:38,590
Do not!

3000
03:28:38,810 --> 03:28:39,290
I swear!

3001
03:28:39,850 --> 03:28:42,190
What did he...

3002
03:28:42,190 --> 03:28:43,590
Why was he paranoid?

3003
03:28:44,350 --> 03:28:45,970
Someone held that baby.

3004
03:28:46,230 --> 03:28:46,750
No!

3005
03:28:49,690 --> 03:28:53,190
I can't believe you were paranoid!

3006
03:28:53,850 --> 03:28:55,530
We were so close!

3007
03:28:56,470 --> 03:28:58,010
I'm so sad.

3008
03:28:58,730 --> 03:29:00,010
I'm so sad.

3009
03:29:03,710 --> 03:29:08,890
Oh my god, I can't believe it Why were you paranoid?

3010
03:29:09,230 --> 03:29:10,470
I don't understand

3011
03:29:15,810 --> 03:29:18,730
Like there was no reason to be paranoid

3012
03:29:25,770 --> 03:29:29,810
All I'm saying was there was no reason for him to be that
scary

3013
03:29:33,990 --> 03:29:35,250
I'm just gonna kill this guy.

3014
03:29:36,850 --> 03:29:37,150
Okay.

3015
03:29:38,930 --> 03:29:40,030
We got this.

3016
03:29:40,170 --> 03:29:41,910
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

3017
03:29:41,970 --> 03:29:42,650
This is it.

3018
03:29:42,790 --> 03:29:43,410
This is the try.

3019
03:29:44,330 --> 03:29:44,830
This is it.

3020
03:29:47,810 --> 03:29:48,930
This is it.

3021
03:29:54,320 --> 03:29:54,760
Okay.

3022
03:29:56,220 --> 03:29:56,660
Alright.

3023
03:29:56,880 --> 03:29:58,320
I'm gonna start painting.

3024
03:30:05,250 --> 03:30:05,690
No.

3025
03:30:08,670 --> 03:30:09,330
No!

3026
03:30:11,410 --> 03:30:11,930
It's fine.

3027
03:30:13,090 --> 03:30:13,930
Not crutch.

3028
03:30:16,750 --> 03:30:17,750
It's fine.

3029
03:30:20,670 --> 03:30:21,870
Um, it's fine.

03:30:22,190 --> 03:30:23,050
It's so fine.

03:30:23,230 --> 03:30:24,230
We're so fine.

3032
03:30:25,090 --> 03:30:26,590
We're so fine.

3033
03:30:27,310 --> 03:30:27,590
Okay.

3034
03:30:28,290 --> 03:30:29,770

You can't come up here.

3074
03:33:31,180 --> 03:33:32,400
I'm fucking on the ceiling.

3075
03:33:37,340 --> 03:33:38,300
Look at them.

03:33:39,220 --> 03:33:40,380
There's no way.

3077
03:33:41,720 --> 03:33:42,800
There's no way.

3078
03:33:44,980 --> 03:33:45,380
What do you mean?

3079
03:33:45,400 --> 03:33:46,800

Come on, leave.

3088
03:34:07,940 --> 03:34:09,180
God, you're so paranoid.

3089
03:34:10,260 --> 03:34:11,020
This one guy.

3090
03:34:11,080 --> 03:34:12,520
I'm just gonna bone rush him.

3091
03:34:13,340 --> 03:34:14,340
I'm just gonna fucking bone.

3092
03:34:14,420 --> 03:34:16,500
There's no way he can fucking kill me.

3093
03:34:17,560 --> 03:34:18,860
He's just one guy.

3094
03:34:21,720 --> 03:34:22,300
Alright.

3095
03:34:23,680 --> 03:34:24,620
This is it.

3096
03:34:25,520 --> 03:34:26,820
I I can do this.

3097
03:34:28,660 --> 03:34:28,660
Watch.

3098
03:34:33,760 --> 03:34:39,170
I'm gonna bone rush him.

3099
03:34:45,130 --> 03:34:45,850
Okay.

3100
03:34:48,270 --> 03:34:49,090
It worked.

3101
03:34:51,210 --> 03:34:52,750
I told you, there's no way.

3102
03:34:54,210 --> 03:34:55,690
I told you.

3103
03:35:00,380 --> 03:35:01,120
There's no way.

3104
03:35:01,360 --> 03:35:02,920
See, eventually they'll split up.

3105
03:35:04,140 --> 03:35:04,760
Please!

3106
03:35:05,040 --> 03:35:05,400
No!

3107
03:35:05,760 --> 03:35:06,080
No!

3108
03:35:06,320 --> 03:35:06,320
No!

3109
03:35:06,540 --> 03:35:06,540
No!

3110
03:35:08,900 --> 03:35:09,580
No!

3111
03:35:11,220 --> 03:35:11,540
No!

3112
03:35:12,760 --> 03:35:13,440
No!

3113
03:35:13,440 --> 03:35:13,440
No!

3114
03:35:13,440 --> 03:35:13,440
No!

3115
03:35:13,440 --> 03:35:13,440
No!

3116
03:35:13,440 --> 03:35:15,020
I told you, they'll split up.

3117
03:35:15,640 --> 03:35:16,920
There's no way.

3118
03:35:18,260 --> 03:35:19,180
There's no way.

3119
03:35:19,300 --> 03:35:21,140
I told you, they'll split up eventually.

3120
03:35:21,840 --> 03:35:22,520
They'll split.

3121
03:35:22,920 --> 03:35:24,400
I told you.

3122
03:35:24,940 --> 03:35:27,880
The buddy system will eventually fail.

3123
03:35:29,560 --> 03:35:30,220
There we go.

3124
03:35:30,520 --> 03:35:32,680
The buddy system will fail!

3125
03:35:40,740 --> 03:35:42,420
I knew it.

3126
03:35:48,180 --> 03:35:50,000
Oh, I don't think I'm gonna blow this correctly.

3127
03:35:51,160 --> 03:35:51,820
That's fine.

3128
03:36:02,050 --> 03:36:02,350
Oh.

3129
03:36:03,290 --> 03:36:03,770
No.

3130
03:36:08,340 --> 03:36:09,120
There you go.

3131

3132
03:36:09,720 --> 03:36:10,060

3133
03:36:10,280 --> 03:36:10,820
The light up!

3134
03:36:11,360 --> 03:36:11,500

3135
03:36:15,270 --> 03:36:15,890
light up!

3136
03:36:16,230 --> 03:36:16,750
Ah!

3137
03:36:21,030 --> 03:36:25,830

3138
03:36:30,950 --> 03:36:35,690
I went between them How is that possible?

3139
03:36:36,670 --> 03:36:38,830
How can you go between them, Doki?

3140
03:36:40,830 --> 03:36:48,190
Oh my god They're leaving the buddy system This is it No

3141
03:36:52,990 --> 03:36:56,290
No Wait.

3142

Okay.

3143
03:37:02,090 --> 03:37:03,890
They're leaving the buddy system.

3144
03:37:05,530 --> 03:37:06,730
I knew it!

3145
03:37:07,550 --> 03:37:09,590
The buddy system is in forever!

3146
03:37:11,230 --> 03:37:11,470
Okay.

3147
03:37:12,830 --> 03:37:13,170
Alright.

3148
03:37:14,610 --> 03:37:15,890
I just gotta kill him.

3149
03:37:16,570 --> 03:37:17,590
This building is ours.

3150
03:37:18,030 --> 03:37:18,890
Joker said so.

3151
03:37:20,650 --> 03:37:21,030
Yes!

3152
03:37:25,100 --> 03:37:25,720
Abaco!

3153
03:37:31,180 --> 03:37:31,780
Okay.

3154
03:37:32,440 --> 03:37:33,340
Alright, here we go.

3155
03:37:34,920 --> 03:37:35,560
This is it.

3156
03:37:39,970 --> 03:37:41,210
There's no way I can best.

3157
03:37:41,690 --> 03:37:42,830
There's no way I can best!

3158
03:37:44,870 --> 03:37:46,250
That's fucking right!

3159
03:37:47,150 --> 03:37:47,670
Bam!

3160
03:37:48,450 --> 03:37:49,130
There we go.

3161
03:37:51,770 --> 03:37:52,950
I did it.

3162
03:37:54,610 --> 03:37:56,010
That's how you do it.

3163
03:37:56,590 --> 03:37:58,150
That's how you stealth.

3164
03:38:01,190 --> 03:38:03,250
That's how you stealth guys.

3165
03:38:04,930 --> 03:38:06,370
Any questions?

3166
03:38:08,910 --> 03:38:10,170
Any questions, guys?

3167
03:38:10,510 --> 03:38:11,810
I'm willing to...

03:38:11,810 --> 03:38:14,250
I'm here all day.

3169
03:38:15,810 --> 03:38:17,750
Alright, how the fuck do I unlock this?

3170
03:38:19,050 --> 03:38:21,170
It is inside.

3171
03:38:23,450 --> 03:38:26,330
The stealthiest bird out there.

3172
03:38:27,150 --> 03:38:30,290
Where the fuck is the code thing for this?

3173
03:38:31,550 --> 03:38:33,890
How the hell the hell am I supposed to hack this?

3174
03:38:34,090 --> 03:38:35,630
What is this?

3175
03:38:36,810 --> 03:38:38,350
What the fuck is this?

3176
03:38:40,650 --> 03:38:41,610
Follows execution.

No problem.

3180
03:38:46,890 --> 03:38:49,190
Oh, I could have done this and be like, peekaboo.

3181
03:38:50,410 --> 03:38:50,890
What the fuck do I?

3182
03:38:50,950 --> 03:38:52,210
Oh, it's over here.

3183
03:38:55,660 --> 03:38:56,140
All right.

3184
03:38:56,640 --> 03:38:57,900

03:39:01,540 --> 03:39:03,800
It should be here.

3187
03:39:05,020 --> 03:39:05,320

3188
03:39:08,060 --> 03:39:08,820

3192
03:39:46,110 --> 03:39:47,050
Oh, this one's harder.

3193
03:39:48,230 --> 03:39:48,610
Oh, no.

3194
03:39:52,170 --> 03:39:52,750

03:39:53,150 --> 03:39:53,830
Oh, my God.

3196
03:39:53,950 --> 03:39:54,950
That one was so difficult.

3197
03:39:55,130 --> 03:39:56,210
I couldn't find it.

3198
03:39:58,690 --> 03:39:59,230
It's okay.

3199
03:39:59,310 --> 03:39:59,670
I did it.

3200
03:39:59,890 --> 03:40:00,250
First try.

3201
03:40:01,670 --> 03:40:02,630
First fucking try.

3202
03:40:07,240 --> 03:40:09,220
Can't believe there was a timer this entire time.

3203
03:40:09,880 --> 03:40:11,520
I was definitely not paying attention.

3204
03:40:13,480 --> 03:40:14,440

03:40:47,820 --> 03:40:49,060
There's nothing in here.

3210
03:40:50,960 --> 03:40:53,800
It's a point of hacking here if there's nothing here.

3211
03:40:55,920 --> 03:40:56,640
What the fuck?

3212
03:40:56,880 --> 03:40:59,040
I felt cheated out of this.

3213
03:41:00,720 --> 03:41:03,820
Oh my god, I felt cheated out of this area.

3214
03:41:04,280 --> 03:41:04,780

03:41:17,260 --> 03:41:19,700
Okay, we gotta go this way.

3221
03:41:20,700 --> 03:41:23,020
Did anyone catch the game last night?

3222
03:41:24,320 --> 03:41:24,440
Huh?

3223
03:41:30,700 --> 03:41:31,580

3224
03:41:33,200 --> 03:41:34,080

3225
03:41:48,800 --> 03:41:49,680
What?

3226
03:41:58,090 --> 03:41:58,970
Huh?

3227
03:42:00,610 --> 03:42:01,990
Why is it in the back car?

3228
03:42:15,940 --> 03:42:16,380
Joker!

3229
03:42:20,750 --> 03:42:21,570
What?

3230
03:42:22,170 --> 03:42:26,370
Oh my god!

3231
03:42:26,390 --> 03:42:27,790
God, it's so cool!

3232
03:42:35,700 --> 03:42:37,760
Oh my god, it's so cool!

3233
03:42:37,980 --> 03:42:38,920
I get to play Joker!

3234
03:42:40,420 --> 03:42:43,380
Oh my god, it's like...

3235
03:42:43,380 --> 03:42:45,180
Yeah, Roboversa!

3236
03:42:47,580 --> 03:42:47,900
Brickham

3237
03:42:54,260 --> 03:42:56,940
Asylum was run by the criminals.

3238
03:42:57,940 --> 03:43:00,380
Just got to check your prisoner, dear.

3239
03:43:01,220 --> 03:43:03,160
Whatever, just be quick.

3240
03:43:03,380 --> 03:43:03,740
Whoa!

3241
03:43:05,140 --> 03:43:06,800
No, he's not.

3242
03:43:07,000 --> 03:43:07,940
We really should.

3243
03:43:07,960 --> 03:43:09,660
She feels sorry for him.

3244
03:43:09,860 --> 03:43:12,180
He never fully got over his parents' death.

3245
03:43:12,760 --> 03:43:15,000
It left him quite insane.

3246
03:43:15,820 --> 03:43:17,200
Oh my god, Mastery dropped.

3247
03:43:17,260 --> 03:43:18,060
Thank you for the 50.

3248
03:43:18,160 --> 03:43:18,680
Give the ships.

3249
03:43:18,800 --> 03:43:19,040
Thank you.

3250
03:43:19,340 --> 03:43:19,860
Thank you.

3251
03:43:20,400 --> 03:43:21,000
We appreciate it.

3252
03:43:21,200 --> 03:43:21,460
Thank you.

3253
03:43:23,640 --> 03:43:24,940
How does he know my identity?

3254
03:43:27,560 --> 03:43:28,780
Oh, oh.

3255
03:43:31,580 --> 03:43:33,580
He's all yours, Joker.

3256
03:43:34,940 --> 03:43:36,540
Am I using my Bruce Wayne voice?

3257
03:43:36,740 --> 03:43:37,940
Come on, Mr. J, we're ready.

3258
03:43:37,960 --> 03:43:40,300
No, put me like, I want to be the Joker.

3259
03:43:41,440 --> 03:43:42,120
Oh.

3260
03:43:42,200 --> 03:43:45,560
Let's start the party with a bag.

3261
03:43:51,260 --> 03:43:52,540
Oh, what?

3262
03:43:54,440 --> 03:43:55,800
I don't...

3263
03:43:55,800 --> 03:43:58,280
How the fuck was I supposed to know?

3264
03:43:58,640 --> 03:44:00,920
Rest in peace, Bruce Wade.

3265
03:44:01,740 --> 03:44:02,680
Oh, shit.

3266
03:44:05,100 --> 03:44:08,740
How the fuck was I supposed to know I was supposed to die?

3267
03:44:09,400 --> 03:44:10,080
Whoa.

3268
03:44:10,460 --> 03:44:11,400
Wait, what?

3269
03:44:21,850 --> 03:44:24,290
I thought it was still a cutscene.

3270
03:44:24,650 --> 03:44:27,530
I thought we were still in a cutscene.

3271
03:44:31,500 --> 03:44:33,300
Are you okay, Batman?

3272
03:44:34,520 --> 03:44:36,060
He is not okay.

3273
03:44:42,720 --> 03:44:44,100
What am I...

3274
03:44:45,240 --> 03:44:46,460
I guess I'll fly here.

3275
03:44:46,600 --> 03:44:47,040
Oh, shit.

3276
03:44:47,140 --> 03:44:48,340
I don't know where to fly to.

3277
03:44:50,360 --> 03:44:51,200
That exploited?

3278
03:44:51,900 --> 03:44:52,180
No.

3279
03:44:53,740 --> 03:44:54,140
What?

3280
03:44:56,120 --> 03:44:57,280
Oh, line?

3281
03:44:57,960 --> 03:44:58,900
Oh, I had my gadgets.

3282
03:44:59,020 --> 03:45:00,020
I didn't know I had my gadgets.

3283
03:45:06,960 --> 03:45:08,960
I didn't know I had my gadgets with me.

3284
03:45:09,080 --> 03:45:09,840
I thought, like...

3285
03:45:09,840 --> 03:45:11,400
What are you doing, little bat?

3286
03:45:19,460 --> 03:45:20,640
Okay, it's time.

3287
03:45:26,200 --> 03:45:27,100
Go up.

3288
03:45:27,460 --> 03:45:27,940
Go up.

3289
03:45:28,200 --> 03:45:28,640
What?

3290
03:45:28,800 --> 03:45:29,280
How?

3291
03:45:30,520 --> 03:45:31,080
How?

3292
03:45:32,600 --> 03:45:34,740
I was so fast.

3293
03:45:34,920 --> 03:45:35,660
Come on.

3294
03:45:35,980 --> 03:45:37,120
That was bullshit.

3295
03:45:38,060 --> 03:45:39,900
That was fucking bullshit.

3296
03:45:40,260 --> 03:45:40,720
What?

3297
03:45:44,360 --> 03:45:46,140
Oh my god.

3298
03:45:46,560 --> 03:45:49,160
Okay, that was also bullshit.

3299
03:45:56,370 --> 03:45:57,650
Okay, here you go.

3300
03:45:59,510 --> 03:46:01,530
It's a joke there is no middle stick.

3301
03:46:02,170 --> 03:46:05,150
You fuckers, I actually thought I fucked up.

3302
03:46:05,550 --> 03:46:07,230
I actually thought I fucked up.

3303
03:46:07,570 --> 03:46:11,230
I was like, I thought you've been like middle button, you
know, like the middle mouse button.

3304
03:46:15,110 --> 03:46:17,390
Oh my god, do we have to dodge?

3305
03:46:19,530 --> 03:46:22,730
You fucker, I actually thought I fucked it up.

3306
03:46:28,330 --> 03:46:30,610
Gotta get him out of here.

3307
03:46:31,910 --> 03:46:35,770
Oh, the chimney saw, I was like, no, there was a middle
mouse, buddy!

3308
03:46:36,270 --> 03:46:36,310
What?

3309
03:46:40,790 --> 03:46:41,350
No!

3310
03:46:41,930 --> 03:46:42,350
No!

3311
03:46:42,630 --> 03:46:44,350
I actually did crash!

3312
03:46:47,170 --> 03:46:48,610
God damn it!

3313
03:46:50,410 --> 03:46:53,130
I actually did crash.

3314
03:46:55,250 --> 03:46:55,810

You know how, like, some women, men send, like, love letters
to, like, serial killers in prison?

3454
03:57:54,370 --> 03:57:57,050

3455
03:57:59,610 --> 03:58:01,810
Oh, no, oh, no, oh, no, I can't find it.

3456
03:58:01,970 --> 03:58:02,570
I can't find it.

3457
03:58:02,730 --> 03:58:03,010
I can't.

3458
03:58:03,070 --> 03:58:03,990
Oh, here you go.

A lot of like serial killers have like wives and like have
have like outside wives and husbands.

3463
03:58:19,440 --> 03:58:25,080
It was like this famous like there was like a murder or
something that was like on trial and then like I don't know

3464
03:58:25,080 --> 03:58:26,300
if it was a guy or girl.

3465
03:58:27,020 --> 03:58:31,940
And then I think it was like fangirls where like oh my god
he's so hot he can't be a murder.

3466
03:58:32,200 --> 03:58:32,800
Look at him.

3467
03:58:32,900 --> 03:58:33,980
He's just misunderstood.

3468
03:58:34,520 --> 03:58:35,840
He's so hot though.

3469
03:58:35,920 --> 03:58:37,260
And I'm just like what the fuck is her?

3470
03:58:40,660 --> 03:58:43,620

No, it wasn't.

3473
03:58:49,160 --> 03:58:51,400
It was someone recent, too.

3474
03:58:52,980 --> 03:58:54,120
I can fix him.

3475
03:58:54,420 --> 03:58:58,120
Even though he murdered so many women, he wouldn't murder
me.

3476
03:58:58,720 --> 03:59:00,660
Like, what the fuck?

3477
03:59:00,900 --> 03:59:01,720

Wait, I don't need a bullet.

3483
03:59:12,600 --> 03:59:13,260

3484
03:59:14,560 --> 03:59:15,000

Oh, he's getting guns!

3487
03:59:19,980 --> 03:59:20,440
I forgot!

3488
03:59:20,620 --> 03:59:20,640
Oh!

3489
03:59:20,960 --> 03:59:21,380
That's right.

3490
03:59:21,400 --> 03:59:21,860
No guns.

3491
03:59:22,060 --> 03:59:22,620
No guns.

3492
03:59:24,880 --> 03:59:25,380
Okay.

3493
03:59:25,920 --> 03:59:26,820
There's no guns.

3494
03:59:26,940 --> 03:59:27,820
I can fly.

3495
03:59:29,820 --> 03:59:30,560
It does.

3496
03:59:30,580 --> 03:59:32,080
It happens a lot more.

3497
03:59:32,640 --> 03:59:35,420
Like, a lot more frequently than you expect.

3498
03:59:35,780 --> 03:59:36,300
Get out.

3499
03:59:36,460 --> 03:59:37,000
No gun.

3500
03:59:37,640 --> 03:59:39,160
This is a fair match.

3501
03:59:40,720 --> 03:59:41,220
Okay.

3502
03:59:41,900 --> 03:59:42,760
That's fucking hard.

3503
03:59:42,920 --> 03:59:43,400
Get over here.

3504
03:59:43,840 --> 03:59:44,640
Get over here!

3505
03:59:45,180 --> 03:59:45,660
Oh shit.

3506
03:59:47,280 --> 03:59:48,100
It's okay.

3507
03:59:49,180 --> 03:59:50,660
Gotta dodge all these guys.

3508
03:59:53,300 --> 03:59:54,240
Throw, throw, throw!

3509
03:59:54,800 --> 03:59:54,940
Throw!

3510
03:59:58,420 --> 03:59:58,980
Okay.

3511
03:59:59,720 --> 04:00:01,060
We gotta get him out of here.

3512
04:00:01,680 --> 04:00:02,740
I can't do a takedown!

3513
04:00:02,900 --> 04:00:04,060
They're all trying to get the gun!

3514
04:00:04,960 --> 04:00:05,520
No.

3515
04:00:05,820 --> 04:00:07,320
No gun for you.

3516
04:00:08,000 --> 04:00:08,340
No!

3517
04:00:08,440 --> 04:00:09,560
There's too many people!

3518
04:00:11,460 --> 04:00:13,940
Okay, one of you guys would let me do a finish, right?

3519
04:00:19,810 --> 04:00:21,270
Nice, we're fine.

3520
04:00:24,870 --> 04:00:25,910
Why can't I get a gun?

3521
04:00:27,450 --> 04:00:30,710
I know, like, I keep asking about it, but I just want gun.

3522
04:00:32,010 --> 04:00:34,310
Like, it can be a non-lethal gun, you know?

3523
04:00:34,670 --> 04:00:40,810
Like, it's a bullet that just stops, like, that just, like,
pinches the skin, and it hurts a little bit.

3524
04:00:42,270 --> 04:00:43,590
Like, it stuns you.

3525
04:00:43,830 --> 04:00:44,890
Yeah, stun guns.

3526
04:00:44,910 --> 04:01:00,470
stun guns aren't lethal Batman why can't I have a better gun
a better stun yeah stun guns aren't lethal that's different

3527
04:01:05,300 --> 04:01:18,320
all right is there anything here that I need to look at oh
the real earth um okay actually maybe not

3528
04:01:22,340 --> 04:01:23,180
Hmm.

3529
04:01:23,680 --> 04:01:24,420
Good question.

3530
04:01:25,000 --> 04:01:26,020
Good question.

3531
04:01:27,520 --> 04:01:28,100
Here?

3532
04:01:31,590 --> 04:01:32,910
Yeah, it's here.

3533
04:01:36,430 --> 04:01:38,050
What a great question.

3534
04:01:38,490 --> 04:01:39,050
Wait, what?

3535
04:01:39,190 --> 04:01:40,090
Where am I?

3536
04:01:49,540 --> 04:01:50,380
Huh?

3537
04:02:21,030 --> 04:02:23,470
You'll be back, and I'll kill him.

3538
04:02:24,030 --> 04:02:27,230
Then cash, then you.

3539
04:02:30,110 --> 04:02:36,770
I don't think like I feel like as a guard you would want to
be like nice to them so like because like they're always

3540
04:02:36,770 --> 04:02:42,030
breaking out right so they're always breaking you know
they're always breaking out there's no like if they break

3541
04:02:42,030 --> 04:02:51,930
out it's like whenever they do break out so like I feel like
at that point you'd want to be nice to them so like so so

3542
04:02:51,930 --> 04:02:56,770
why would you like you know be antagonistic to them when you
know they're gonna fucking break out

3543
04:03:03,290 --> 04:03:13,370
Okay, all I'm saying is that eventually Eventually they're
gonna get out My game crashed

3544
04:03:19,490 --> 04:03:23,810
So like why would you ever be like antagonistic to the
villains

3545
04:03:27,590 --> 04:03:34,130
What okay but like if you're more mean to them then they'll
be like they're gonna like you know if they're gonna kill

3546
04:03:34,130 --> 04:03:39,650
you anyway okay so like you're going in thinking these
villains are gonna kill you anyway but like if you're like

3547
04:03:39,650 --> 04:03:46,750
extra mean to them then they're gonna make it more painful
more slow and painful you know so if you're nice to them

3548
04:03:46,750 --> 04:03:56,230
they'll be like you know what you were nice to me oh yeah
we'll we'll let it end quick you know it'll be quick but

3549
04:03:56,230 --> 04:03:57,650
instead because cash was

3550
04:04:13,500 --> 04:04:14,120
What?

3551
04:04:14,640 --> 04:04:17,860
One step closer and this goes into the water.

3552
04:04:18,300 --> 04:04:19,820
I feel like the water's already tainted.

3553
04:04:20,020 --> 04:04:21,900
I'm out of Joker's shit in there.

3554
04:04:22,920 --> 04:04:24,160
Darkest nightmares.

3555
04:04:24,740 --> 04:04:28,320
And you will never reach your precious venom roots.

3556
04:04:30,640 --> 04:04:32,180
Oh no, not the water.

3557
04:04:37,320 --> 04:04:37,920
Oh shit!

3558
04:04:40,880 --> 04:04:42,400
Wait, is he gonna beat him?

3559
04:04:43,840 --> 04:04:44,460
Oh!

3560
04:04:53,220 --> 04:05:01,360
looking access to the killer crocs there where is that okay
this way oh my okay i don't think he can breathe down there

3561
04:05:01,360 --> 04:05:09,280
so like he could have been he might as well be dead i don't
know i don't know if he could actually like breathe down

3562
04:05:09,280 --> 04:05:18,520
like i don't know no i can't swim what are you fucking sonic

3563
04:05:23,160 --> 04:05:24,440
God damn it.

3564
04:05:24,560 --> 04:05:26,060
I can't swim, guys.

3565
04:05:28,080 --> 04:05:29,220
Why can't you swim?

3566
04:05:35,250 --> 04:05:38,450
Perfect time for the underweight gas mask.

3567
04:05:38,810 --> 04:05:40,610
Thank you for the super chat, Jonathan.

3568
04:05:41,110 --> 04:05:41,310
Thank you.

3569
04:05:41,450 --> 04:05:42,090
Thank you.

3570
04:05:42,450 --> 04:05:45,290
What's the point of you can't swim, Batman?

3571
04:05:47,290 --> 04:05:49,550
Is this why Aquaman's on the team?

3572
04:05:50,410 --> 04:05:52,550
Is he your, like, token swim boy?

3573
04:05:55,210 --> 04:05:56,590
swim so you got Aquaman?

3574
04:06:00,320 --> 04:06:02,740
He's carrying too much muscle, Toki.

3575
04:06:03,020 --> 04:06:04,220
Don't understand.

3576
04:06:08,760 --> 04:06:12,340
Oracle, I'm heading into Crocs' lair to collect the plant
scores Ivy spoke about.

3577
04:06:13,020 --> 04:06:14,880
He's in some kind of old sewer network.

3578
04:06:15,460 --> 04:06:16,340
Send me the schematics.

3579
04:06:16,500 --> 04:06:17,840
It's like a maze down here.

3580
04:06:18,000 --> 04:06:19,300
There's nothing on record.

3581
04:06:19,800 --> 04:06:21,580
Bruce, are you sure about this?

3582
04:06:22,180 --> 04:06:23,260
Sounds like a suicide mission.

3583
04:06:23,440 --> 04:06:24,900
Holy chill, Toki.

3584
04:06:25,240 --> 04:06:32,500
No one cares about Aquaman until the aquaman moved until
like what's his name jason samoa fucking played aquaman

3585
04:06:32,500 --> 04:06:47,680
croc's just an animal and animals just need traps and the
right bait i'll be fine oh that's a bigger okay all right oh

3586
04:06:47,680 --> 04:06:51,980

3588
04:07:02,680 --> 04:07:03,680
Whoa, where is he?

3589
04:07:04,340 --> 04:07:08,780
But all I'm saying, no one cared about him until Jason Mamoa
was...

3590
04:07:08,780 --> 04:07:11,760
Until Jason Mamoa was Batman.

3591
04:07:12,400 --> 04:07:14,580
Not Batman, was Hawk of Man.

3592
04:07:24,080 --> 04:07:25,240
That'll be fine.

3593
04:07:25,700 --> 04:07:26,980
Is he gonna do Eat Me?

3594
04:07:34,820 --> 04:07:36,560
Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.

I can't believe I have been on Wi-Fi in fucking forever.

What do you mean?

3611
04:09:09,540 --> 04:09:11,140
Imagine thinking of Super Chat.

3612
04:09:11,840 --> 04:09:15,240
Maybe the Wi-Fi is the ransom mail.

3613
04:09:15,940 --> 04:09:18,800
I can't believe I'm on fucking Wi-Fi.

3614

Why are you not connecting?

3619
04:09:35,700 --> 04:09:37,060
Is it because I'm on Wi-Fi?

3620
04:09:38,700 --> 04:09:41,160
Guys, I'm trying to figure this out.

04:12:57,190 --> 04:12:59,870
Oh, whoops.

3653
04:13:00,270 --> 04:13:00,270
Okay.

3654
04:13:02,710 --> 04:13:03,190
Nice.

3655
04:13:03,570 --> 04:13:04,350
We did it.

3656
04:13:06,270 --> 04:13:06,910
There we go.

3657
04:13:07,010 --> 04:13:07,850
I figured it out.

3658
04:13:08,250 --> 04:13:09,470
Guys, I figured it out.

3659
04:13:12,510 --> 04:13:14,250
Here we go.

3660
04:13:15,890 --> 04:13:17,230
Everything is fine.

3661
04:13:18,570 --> 04:13:19,930
We figured it all out.

3662
04:13:20,250 --> 04:13:22,170
Nothing to worry about.

3663
04:13:24,070 --> 04:13:25,330
Like we never left.

3664
04:13:27,150 --> 04:13:27,990
There we go.

3665
04:13:29,130 --> 04:13:29,910
Easy.

3666
04:13:31,410 --> 04:13:32,810
So easy.

3667
04:13:33,770 --> 04:13:34,910
Back compute.

3668
04:13:35,350 --> 04:13:36,450
Everything is gold.

3669
04:13:36,890 --> 04:13:41,590
It's like if anything wrong can happen, that's happening,
it's happening today.

3670
04:13:45,250 --> 04:13:46,030
Nice.

3671
04:13:47,150 --> 04:13:48,450
Let me gather this.

3672
04:13:53,130 --> 04:13:55,850
And my computer is slowly dying.

3673
04:13:56,530 --> 04:13:59,270
My internet is slowly dying too.

3674
04:14:05,430 --> 04:14:07,270
We're here for the ride.

3675
04:14:07,990 --> 04:14:09,850
Am I halfway through this game yet?

3676
04:14:14,090 --> 04:14:16,070
Murphy's Law and Fall In Fact.

3677
04:14:18,930 --> 04:14:19,390
Oh, there you go.

3678
04:14:19,470 --> 04:14:20,010
Okay, so we're here.

3679
04:14:21,790 --> 04:14:22,390
Wait, what?

3680
04:14:26,190 --> 04:14:26,850
Ah!

3681
04:14:27,170 --> 04:14:27,790
What do you mean?

3682
04:14:27,810 --> 04:14:29,110
What happened?!

3683
04:14:32,260 --> 04:14:32,900
Batman!

3684
04:14:33,400 --> 04:14:34,860
Why did it curve Batman?

3685
04:14:35,360 --> 04:14:36,420
Why did it curve?

3686
04:14:37,420 --> 04:14:43,420
Why the fuck?

3687
04:14:44,240 --> 04:14:46,140
You don't need to curve the bullet!

3688
04:14:53,430 --> 04:14:55,130
Wait, what is this behind me?

3689
04:14:55,690 --> 04:14:55,990
Okay.

3690
04:14:57,250 --> 04:14:57,770
There we go.

3691
04:15:02,090 --> 04:15:04,270
It's normal to curve.

3692
04:15:07,570 --> 04:15:08,350
Okay, nice.

3693
04:15:12,140 --> 04:15:13,960
Now, I actually don't even know how much...

3694
04:15:13,960 --> 04:15:15,740
You guys have given me so many conflicting answers.

3695
04:15:15,880 --> 04:15:17,660
I actually don't even know how much I have left.

3696
04:15:23,060 --> 04:15:23,460
Okay.

3697
04:15:25,180 --> 04:15:25,980
There we go.

3698
04:15:26,200 --> 04:15:27,240
Oh, my guys.

3699
04:15:29,920 --> 04:15:30,660
Alright, there you go.

3700
04:15:30,780 --> 04:15:32,440
I trust my doctor.

3701
04:15:34,820 --> 04:15:37,100
I feel like I can just crouch, walk as fast.

3702
04:15:41,440 --> 04:15:43,280
Are we 75% done?

3703
04:15:43,460 --> 04:15:44,900
Wait, I can actually finish this today.

3704
04:15:48,200 --> 04:15:48,680
Okay.

3705
04:15:49,860 --> 04:15:50,620
Thank God.

3706
04:15:53,400 --> 04:15:56,440
Technically, I can finish this today if it's 75%.

3707
04:16:03,040 --> 04:16:04,720
Alright, we're in it for the long haul.

3708
04:16:06,260 --> 04:16:08,480
We went through so many things together, guys.

3709
04:16:10,440 --> 04:16:11,820
Why did he go that way?

3710
04:16:16,570 --> 04:16:17,050
Okay.

3711
04:16:19,930 --> 04:16:20,410
Okay.

3712
04:16:27,270 --> 04:16:28,750

04:26:36,740 --> 04:26:38,120
Alright, what do we upgrade?

3824
04:26:40,180 --> 04:26:40,900
What's the next?

3825
04:26:40,940 --> 04:26:41,980
I guess batter and power.

3826
04:26:42,200 --> 04:26:42,440
You know what?

3827
04:26:42,440 --> 04:26:43,500
Yeah, batter and power.

3828
04:26:44,340 --> 04:26:44,800
Look at.

3829
04:26:46,800 --> 04:26:48,120
Wait, did I go the wrong way?

3830
04:26:48,580 --> 04:26:49,340
Oh, in the wrong way.

3831
04:26:49,380 --> 04:26:49,900
Fuck, okay.

3832
04:26:50,080 --> 04:26:50,860
It's this way.

3833
04:26:51,900 --> 04:26:54,680
Yeah, just enough, I think.

3834
04:26:56,080 --> 04:26:56,480
Guys!

3835
04:26:59,800 --> 04:27:00,620
Wait, this way.

3836
04:27:02,140 --> 04:27:02,740
Wee!

3837
04:27:03,720 --> 04:27:05,000
It was not this way, guys.

3838
04:27:05,140 --> 04:27:06,340
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

3839
04:27:06,380 --> 04:27:07,280
I'm cheesing the system.

3840
04:27:08,060 --> 04:27:08,960
I'm cheesing it?

3841
04:27:10,700 --> 04:27:12,960
I'm cheesing the system, but...

3842
04:27:13,660 --> 04:27:14,040
Yay!

3843
04:27:15,060 --> 04:27:16,260
Maybe I'll...

3844
04:27:16,260 --> 04:27:16,720
Yes!

3845
04:27:17,020 --> 04:27:17,720
I did it!

3846
04:27:20,360 --> 04:27:20,960
Nice.

3847
04:27:21,380 --> 04:27:23,360
I cheesed it perfectly.

3848
04:27:27,180 --> 04:27:27,780
Nice.

3849
04:27:27,780 --> 04:27:29,080
Perfectly cheesed.

3850
04:27:30,960 --> 04:27:32,320
As all things should be.

3851
04:27:35,160 --> 04:27:36,260
Alright, let's see.

3852
04:27:36,340 --> 04:27:36,980
Where do we go?

3853
04:27:38,100 --> 04:27:39,240
Oh, it's this place.

3854
04:27:40,360 --> 04:27:41,120
It's this way.

3855
04:27:42,160 --> 04:27:42,420
Alright.

3856
04:27:44,220 --> 04:27:45,320
Gotta go ahead this way.

3857
04:27:46,100 --> 04:27:46,560
Oh, shit!

3858
04:27:46,660 --> 04:27:47,140
Hey guys!

3859
04:27:47,480 --> 04:27:47,780
Whoa!

3860
04:27:48,680 --> 04:27:49,680
Guys, guys!

3861
04:27:49,840 --> 04:27:50,340
Come on!

3862
04:27:51,120 --> 04:27:52,820
I have two batterans.

3863
04:27:53,040 --> 04:27:54,520
Oh, this is the wrong battering!

3864
04:27:55,380 --> 04:27:56,920
Now I have two battering.

3865
04:27:57,100 --> 04:27:58,460
No, this is the wrong one again!

3866
04:28:01,200 --> 04:28:02,380
Oh, damn it.

3867
04:28:02,660 --> 04:28:04,180
Let me just get rid of this guy.

3868
04:28:05,960 --> 04:28:06,560
Alright, nice.

3869
04:28:07,580 --> 04:28:09,360
I did not see all of these people.

3870
04:28:10,740 --> 04:28:11,200
What's up, guys?

3871
04:28:11,440 --> 04:28:12,600
Wait, you have a gun?

3872
04:28:13,340 --> 04:28:13,920
Oh, my God.

3873
04:28:14,660 --> 04:28:15,120
Don't worry.

3874
04:28:15,660 --> 04:28:16,440
Darks, so slide.

3875
04:28:18,700 --> 04:28:20,740
Also, Joy Boys, welcome to the tomato farm.

3876
04:28:21,020 --> 04:28:21,500
Welcome, welcome.

3877
04:28:23,140 --> 04:28:23,760
A detective.

3878
04:28:23,960 --> 04:28:25,040
Yes, we have standards.

3879
04:28:25,340 --> 04:28:27,420
What the fuck are you doing with this box?

3880
04:28:28,240 --> 04:28:29,700
Oh, no, a toaster.

3881
04:28:30,240 --> 04:28:30,940
What will we do?

3882
04:28:30,960 --> 04:28:32,820
Oh no, he's grabbing the gun.

3883
04:28:32,980 --> 04:28:34,960
He's grabbing the gun.

3884
04:28:38,260 --> 04:28:39,500
Detective Shade, thank you for the super chat.

3885
04:28:39,580 --> 04:28:40,400
Thank you, thank you.

3886
04:28:40,680 --> 04:28:41,960
Yes, we have standards.

3887
04:28:42,200 --> 04:28:47,260
But if a homie asks for a kiss, need a serious, and then the
homie will get a kiss on the serious.

3888
04:28:48,300 --> 04:28:50,140
Thank you for the super chat, Shane.

3889
04:28:50,400 --> 04:28:51,200
Thank you, thank you.

3890
04:28:56,700 --> 04:28:57,340
It's okay.

3891
04:28:57,660 --> 04:28:58,840
I've got the mold samples.

3892
04:28:59,380 --> 04:29:01,080
I'm heading to the Batcave to mix up the antidote.

3893
04:29:01,080 --> 04:29:01,580
That's true.

3894
04:29:01,660 --> 04:29:02,760
You can't reject the homie.

3895
04:29:03,960 --> 04:29:15,860
what you're doing being even a fan of a hundred dollar fog
raw can enjoy a 12 dollar bucket of i'm the fog raw right

3896
04:29:15,860 --> 04:29:21,240
i'm the duck you fucking force fed and then ate the liver of
right guys

3897
04:29:25,420 --> 04:29:33,080
right all right i am right

3898
04:29:37,260 --> 04:29:40,740
guys I need a dough!

3899
04:29:41,220 --> 04:29:42,120
Scan and opus.

3900
04:29:51,560 --> 04:29:52,580
Alright, this way.

3901
04:29:53,340 --> 04:29:55,320
I'm in the bat cave.

3902
04:29:55,780 --> 04:29:58,060
That's definitely not OSHA approved.

3903
04:29:59,480 --> 04:30:00,380
Where am I getting all this?

3904
04:30:00,680 --> 04:30:03,960
This is where all the power bill went to.

3905
04:30:04,640 --> 04:30:04,880
Close.

3906
04:30:05,380 --> 04:30:06,960
It's been more difficult than I expected.

3907
04:30:10,260 --> 04:30:13,800
The process is slow, difficult, and doesn't produce much
antidote.

3908
04:30:14,440 --> 04:30:22,940
and the good news the chemical will definitely stop ivy it
may also reverse the Titan transformation I need to run some

3909
04:30:22,940 --> 04:30:31,840
more tests to be sure I've set the computer to create more
but I need to get out of here and find Ivy thank God her

I don't understand.

04:32:36,740 --> 04:32:39,220
How could the Wi-Fi do this to me?

3928
04:32:39,540 --> 04:32:42,180
I don't know.

3929
04:32:44,620 --> 04:32:45,900
Oh my god.

3930
04:32:48,140 --> 04:32:50,900
How could the Wi-Fi do this?

3931
04:32:52,420 --> 04:32:54,940
Up in nothing but great to the Wi-Fi.

3933
04:32:57,620 --> 04:32:59,080

04:32:59,620 --> 04:33:00,540
Am I...

3935
04:33:06,660 --> 04:33:08,160
Oh my god.

3936
04:33:09,380 --> 04:33:11,660

Everything is fine.

3955
04:34:38,220 --> 04:34:38,860
There we go.

3956
04:34:42,820 --> 04:34:44,900
Alright, wait, I forgot to...

3957
04:34:44,900 --> 04:34:46,720
I need to tap back into my...

3958
04:34:46,720 --> 04:34:48,140
so I can see my chat.

3959
04:34:48,880 --> 04:34:49,020
Okay.

3960
04:34:50,280 --> 04:34:50,600
Nice.

3961
04:34:51,880 --> 04:34:52,220
That's Alan.

3962
04:34:52,320 --> 04:34:53,040
Thank you for the super chat.

3963
04:34:53,180 --> 04:34:53,360
Thank you.

3964
04:34:53,600 --> 04:34:53,780
Thank you.

3965
04:34:53,780 --> 04:34:55,180
We gotta stop Poison Ivy now.

3966
04:34:55,240 --> 04:34:56,120
How do I get out of here?

3967
04:34:57,420 --> 04:34:58,440
I guess, like, here?

3968
04:34:59,420 --> 04:35:00,000
That's what I'm saying.

3969
04:35:00,100 --> 04:35:02,660
Okay, anyway, as I was saying, who the fuck built this?

3970
04:35:07,940 --> 04:35:08,260
Like...

3971
04:35:08,260 --> 04:35:10,120
Are you guys as confused as me?

3972
04:35:11,440 --> 04:35:11,960
I don't know.

3973
04:35:12,100 --> 04:35:12,440
Who built this?

3974
04:35:12,460 --> 04:35:17,140
This way is blocked by plants.

3975
04:35:17,760 --> 04:35:19,040
I need to find another way out.

3976
04:35:19,860 --> 04:35:20,800
I guess this way.

3977
04:35:23,800 --> 04:35:26,360
There's no way Bruce Wayne did this.

3978
04:35:26,960 --> 04:35:28,520
Like, yeah, he beats up people.

3979
04:35:28,900 --> 04:35:31,540
But, like, he does not have the fucking...

3980
04:35:31,540 --> 04:35:35,300
He does not have, like, the work ethics to build this.

3981
04:35:35,700 --> 04:35:36,560
God damn it.

3982
04:35:38,440 --> 04:35:41,200
There's no way to let Alfred build this.

3983
04:35:41,320 --> 04:35:42,440
He's fucking old.

3984
04:35:45,280 --> 04:35:45,960
Oh.

3985
04:35:47,360 --> 04:35:48,520
Oh, okay, here we go.

3986
04:35:48,620 --> 04:35:50,340
Oh, I can finally do that wall.

3987
04:35:50,660 --> 04:35:51,020
Okay, nice.

3988
04:35:51,280 --> 04:35:51,420
Okay.

3989
04:35:56,780 --> 04:35:58,920
He built multiple by himself?

3990
04:36:00,800 --> 04:36:01,160
Bro.

3991
04:36:01,660 --> 04:36:02,520
Okay, Labrador.

3992
04:36:03,900 --> 04:36:04,980
Nice kick, Batman.

3993
04:36:06,000 --> 04:36:06,380
Ugh.

3994
04:36:09,080 --> 04:36:12,820
There's no way he built this by himself.

3995
04:36:13,980 --> 04:36:14,320
Okay.

3996
04:36:16,900 --> 04:36:21,100
Jason Mamoa built it painted thank you for the super chat
thank you thank you

3997
04:36:26,110 --> 04:36:33,830

got like kryptonite like those like you know like those like

3998
04:36:33,830 --> 04:36:38,250
mob wrist brace or whatever and but then it's like
kryptonite

3999
04:36:41,930 --> 04:36:46,330
because Alfred does not have the engineer degree to build a
fucking bad cave

4000
04:36:50,310 --> 04:36:55,070
I refuse to believe that he has the degree to fucking...

4001
04:36:55,070 --> 04:36:58,430
The engineer degree to build a back gate.

4002
04:37:01,430 --> 04:37:03,430
Where do I go from here?

4003
04:37:05,850 --> 04:37:07,570
Sure he does.

4004
04:37:08,210 --> 04:37:11,270
Guys, I know you're all Alfred fanboys.

4005
04:37:11,990 --> 04:37:15,010
But like, you guys have to think real fast.

4006
04:37:17,470 --> 04:37:20,210
Guys, think for a second, please.

4007
04:37:27,340 --> 04:37:29,060
He can get one.

4008
04:37:29,180 --> 04:37:32,480
Yes, but that doesn't mean he's qualified to fucking build a
bat cave.

4009
04:37:33,760 --> 04:37:35,500
Alfred's Mike Kamioshi.

4010
04:37:39,480 --> 04:37:41,260
It's true, I just googled it.

4011
04:37:41,520 --> 04:37:44,820
Then that makes me less trustworthy of the bat cave.

4012
04:37:46,100 --> 04:37:47,980
He doesn't even have a degree for this.

4013
04:37:48,060 --> 04:37:53,140
How can I trust him to build a fucking structure in a cave?

4014
04:37:56,080 --> 04:37:57,140
Alfred's a homie.

4015
04:37:57,220 --> 04:37:58,200
Well, he's fucking dead.

4016
04:38:03,140 --> 04:38:06,220
Do you not remember what I established?

4017
04:38:06,980 --> 04:38:09,380
He's been dead for five years.

4018
04:38:10,600 --> 04:38:11,640
Here I go.

4019
04:38:15,940 --> 04:38:17,240
I'm called for.

4020
04:38:21,170 --> 04:38:21,590
Here?

4021
04:38:24,490 --> 04:38:25,970
I'm just back here.

4022
04:38:29,170 --> 04:38:30,990
Isn't this the original cave?

4023
04:38:31,970 --> 04:38:32,790
No, this is different.

4024
04:38:36,450 --> 04:38:37,290
Too soon.

4025
04:38:39,030 --> 04:38:39,850
Oh, no, this is different.

4026
04:38:46,180 --> 04:38:48,160
You guys had to know this sooner or later.

4027
04:38:48,700 --> 04:38:50,820
Because I've said it during the part one.

4028
04:38:58,130 --> 04:39:00,930
He won't be when they reboot it.

4029
04:39:02,450 --> 04:39:03,790
Okay, that's true.

4030
04:39:04,330 --> 04:39:04,930
That's true.

4031
04:39:05,790 --> 04:39:06,770
You're not wrong.

4032
04:39:06,970 --> 04:39:08,050
You're not wrong, guys.

4033
04:39:08,410 --> 04:39:09,010
Don't worry.

4034
04:39:09,110 --> 04:39:11,190
When they reboot it.

4035
04:39:14,690 --> 04:39:18,550
That man literally chose to build a getaway home under
asylum.

4036
04:39:19,550 --> 04:39:20,110
Yes, but who?

4037
04:39:20,330 --> 04:39:23,210
There's no way Bruce Wayne built this by himself.

4038
04:39:23,410 --> 04:39:26,710
I refuse to believe Bruce Wayne built this by himself.

4039
04:39:27,030 --> 04:39:27,670
He doesn't have...

4040
04:39:27,670 --> 04:39:29,090
He didn't even finish school.

4041
04:39:30,430 --> 04:39:32,490
He went and learned martial arts.

4042
04:39:35,290 --> 04:39:36,770
Lucius Fox is underrated.

4043
04:39:37,350 --> 04:39:44,710
with the gadgets and stuff yeah they really get one guy to
build the fucking oh my god it's time to fist this plant he

4044
04:39:44,710 --> 04:39:56,950
filed some tools like now i'm scared because he's more
likely to build a sinkhole they won't get that far my

4045
04:39:56,950 --> 04:40:00,910
antidote will stop them all

4046
04:40:05,060 --> 04:40:09,640
right go keep please he's a billionaire

4047
04:40:16,860 --> 04:40:25,080
even the bat cave that's fucked up okay that's fucked up
that he got two like elderly people to build his fucking

4048
04:40:25,080 --> 04:40:35,800
home unfortunately unfortunately nothing that simple I'm at
the main sewer junction and appears to be polluted with

4049
04:40:35,800 --> 04:40:46,360
Titan I feel like that's even worse what's he doing now oh
shit fist fist All right, ow.

4050
04:40:52,620 --> 04:40:53,500
Where do I go?

4051
04:40:54,320 --> 04:40:55,120
Where am I?

4052
04:40:55,780 --> 04:40:57,420
Okay, I need to figure out how to get up there.

4053
04:40:58,760 --> 04:40:59,700
Where are the plants?

4054
04:41:02,420 --> 04:41:05,680
He made kids build his fucking game?

4055
04:41:12,020 --> 04:41:14,220
Like I said, Robbins.

4056
04:41:15,060 --> 04:41:15,900
Help with building.

4057
04:41:16,440 --> 04:41:18,920
Bro, the elderly and the kids?

4058
04:41:19,200 --> 04:41:20,340
We need to stop him.

4059
04:41:22,500 --> 04:41:24,580
Somebody saw Batman.

4060
04:41:37,310 --> 04:41:40,390
Alright, I think it's like...

4061
04:41:40,390 --> 04:41:42,730
Am I close to the fucking area yet?

4062
04:41:43,950 --> 04:41:45,910
No, I have to get head up.

4063
04:41:46,630 --> 04:41:46,890
No.

4064
04:41:48,410 --> 04:41:50,790
Who's gonna stop him, Joker?

4065
04:41:51,450 --> 04:41:54,510
No one can stop him.

4066
04:41:55,510 --> 04:41:57,770
Game that, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank
you!

4067
04:41:58,010 --> 04:41:58,750
Batman Facts.

4068
04:41:59,010 --> 04:42:02,330
Batman builds a Batman with the help of Alfred, Robin, and
Harold.

4069
04:42:02,890 --> 04:42:03,690
Batman's tech guide.

4070
04:42:03,830 --> 04:42:09,810
Wayne tells a construction cool he's building a scenic cave,
and then they haul it out and assemble the mechanical bits.

4071
04:42:10,350 --> 04:42:10,750
But this

4072
04:42:21,530 --> 04:42:24,230
time, it's full of Titan.

4073
04:42:24,910 --> 04:42:25,810
How do I stop it?

4074
04:42:26,890 --> 04:42:29,910
Oh my god, he's gonna poison the water supply again.

4075
04:42:30,650 --> 04:42:31,590
Also, thank you, and Super Chat.

4076
04:42:31,630 --> 04:42:32,150
Yeah, I want to read.

4077
04:42:32,250 --> 04:42:32,470
Thank you.

4078
04:42:32,570 --> 04:42:33,070
Thank you.

4079
04:42:33,190 --> 04:42:34,330
I can't believe it!

4080
04:42:35,030 --> 04:42:40,290
He got kids and the other He's gonna stop him!

4081
04:42:44,050 --> 04:42:45,290
Alright, fist.

4082
04:42:49,450 --> 04:42:51,290
Why does this look like a...

4083
04:42:51,290 --> 04:42:53,400
Why does this cave shape like a bat?

4084
04:42:54,710 --> 04:42:54,990
Hmm.

4085
04:42:57,150 --> 04:42:57,850
Wee.

4086
04:43:00,750 --> 04:43:01,830
That's weird.

4087
04:43:07,160 --> 04:43:07,580
Ow.

4088
04:43:09,780 --> 04:43:10,940
Where did I go?

4089
04:43:11,880 --> 04:43:12,440
This way?

4090
04:43:14,500 --> 04:43:15,560
Where the fuck is he?

4091
04:43:16,900 --> 04:43:18,480
God, there's so many areas.

4092
04:43:19,760 --> 04:43:20,720
They go the wrong way?

4093
04:43:23,700 --> 04:43:24,340
This way?

4094
04:43:26,020 --> 04:43:28,560
Bro, where the fuck is the exit?

4095
04:43:32,050 --> 04:43:33,550
Okay, it's like here.

4096
04:43:35,450 --> 04:43:36,790
It's below me, I think.

4097
04:43:39,030 --> 04:43:40,050
Yeah, it's right here.

4098
04:43:40,170 --> 04:43:40,830
Okay, thank God.

4099
04:43:44,940 --> 04:43:45,460

believe I went down.

4102
04:44:16,540 --> 04:44:18,020
This is... It's because I'm on Wi-Fi.

4103
04:44:19,720 --> 04:44:23,060
Even my fucking brain cells have gone down with the Wi-Fi.

4104
04:44:25,320 --> 04:44:27,260
Gamers don't look up, Cos.

4105
04:44:27,580 --> 04:44:28,000
No!

4106
04:44:28,600 --> 04:44:29,020

04:44:41,880 --> 04:44:42,580
Back in the beginning?

Okay, I can fast travel.

04:44:43,780 --> 04:44:45,020
I can, like, speedrun this.

4115
04:44:46,740 --> 04:44:48,040
I blame the Wi-Fi.

4116
04:44:49,240 --> 04:45:02,380
If I wasn't on Wi-Fi, things would be easier it's never my
fault it's the wi-fi's fault all right here we go

4133
04:46:44,770 --> 04:46:45,810
Can I...

4134
04:46:45,810 --> 04:46:47,030
Can I do it from...

4135
04:46:47,950 --> 04:46:48,550
With the claw?

4136
04:46:50,070 --> 04:46:50,310
Wait.

4137
04:46:50,930 --> 04:46:51,350

Nice.

4139
04:46:56,570 --> 04:46:57,370
Back claw time.

04:47:05,870 --> 04:47:07,110
Make a bridge for me!

4145
04:47:11,450 --> 04:47:13,870
God damn it, I wanted them to make a bridge.

4146
04:47:14,030 --> 04:47:15,070
Wait, how the...

4147
04:47:15,070 --> 04:47:16,850
How the fuck do I get over there still?

4148
04:47:18,890 --> 04:47:19,850
Instructions unclear.

4149
04:47:24,590 --> 04:47:25,070
Alright.

4150
04:47:26,770 --> 04:47:28,090
Obviously not this.

4151
04:47:30,810 --> 04:47:31,770
Drapa and...

4152
04:47:31,870 --> 04:47:33,790
Can I grapple up now?

4153
04:47:34,330 --> 04:47:34,910
Oh, now I can.

4154
04:47:35,010 --> 04:47:35,210
Okay.

4155
04:47:35,510 --> 04:47:37,210
I didn't realize I can grapple now.

4156
04:47:39,010 --> 04:47:39,030
Yes.

4157
04:47:40,270 --> 04:47:40,670
Yay.

4158
04:47:42,550 --> 04:47:43,630
Wow, what the fuck?

4159
04:47:43,830 --> 04:47:44,890
Where did you come from?

4160
04:47:46,330 --> 04:47:47,050
Holy shit.

4161
04:47:47,450 --> 04:47:48,530
I'm so blind.

4162
04:47:49,090 --> 04:47:50,190
All right, so thank you for the five.

4163
04:47:50,270 --> 04:47:51,070

Well, enjoy it while you can.

4169
04:48:00,610 --> 04:48:01,850

4201
04:50:20,560 --> 04:50:21,200
Gargoyle!

04:50:24,780 --> 04:50:27,500

in the dream again I made a new pile

4220
04:52:35,460 --> 04:52:37,200
File number two.

4221
04:52:40,640 --> 04:52:41,520
My pile.

4222
04:52:42,280 --> 04:52:43,960
Alright, what was the riddle for this?

4223
04:52:44,180 --> 04:52:44,780
Riddle me this.

4224
04:52:45,620 --> 04:52:46,720
Oh, hey, there's a thing here.

4225
04:52:49,940 --> 04:52:50,900
See, I think it was super chat.

4226
04:52:50,940 --> 04:52:53,400
I think the concussion won't kill him, but the medical...

4227
04:52:53,400 --> 04:52:54,280
That's what I'm saying.

4228
04:52:54,900 --> 04:52:57,680
Like, this is much worse than, like, not killing.

4229
04:52:58,140 --> 04:53:00,240
Because now you're giving him, like, medical debt.

4230
04:53:00,840 --> 04:53:01,640
In America.

4231
04:53:02,580 --> 04:53:07,580
And I'm pretty sure, like, because, like, it's a superhero
area, too.

4232
04:53:08,980 --> 04:53:13,840
So, like, the insurance is, like, even worse than normal
insurance.

4233
04:53:14,420 --> 04:53:15,380
And I feel like the meta...

4234
04:53:15,380 --> 04:53:15,800
Oh, my gosh.

4235
04:53:15,880 --> 04:53:18,300
Being a doctor must be so fucking nice.

4236
04:53:18,900 --> 04:53:21,540
Because all the people that are, like, need doctors.

4237
04:53:25,160 --> 04:53:26,420
Riddling me this.

4238
04:53:27,920 --> 04:53:30,300
Wait, that's why Batman owns, like, a pharmacy.

4239
04:53:31,220 --> 04:53:34,100
Do you guys know Batman also owns a pharmacy?

4240
04:53:34,720 --> 04:53:36,160
Oh my god!

4241
04:53:36,920 --> 04:53:38,320
That's so fucked up, Batman.

4242
04:53:43,560 --> 04:53:45,800
Batman, that's pretty fucked up.

4243
04:53:46,060 --> 04:53:47,300
He is part of the problem.

4244
04:53:49,360 --> 04:53:51,260
He is actually part of the problem.

4245
04:53:51,680 --> 04:53:52,220
Holy shit.

4246
04:53:53,560 --> 04:53:55,160
I never realized that.

4247
04:53:58,660 --> 04:53:59,720
Anything to scan here?

4248
04:54:00,940 --> 04:54:01,840
It all adds up.

4249
04:54:01,940 --> 04:54:02,180
Oh yeah.

4250
04:54:02,180 --> 04:54:25,290
I mean okay it's time for hacking time okay where's the
other one nice two last one oh no why is the last one always

4251
04:54:25,290 --> 04:54:34,850
the hardest where is it oh here is nice the Batman infinite
money glitch.

4252
04:54:35,630 --> 04:54:38,310
It's like the infinite chocolate glitch, but for money.

4253
04:54:40,670 --> 04:54:40,670
Nice.

4254
04:54:40,810 --> 04:54:41,610
How do I solve this riddle?

4255
04:54:41,750 --> 04:54:42,710
What was this riddle again?

4256
04:54:46,450 --> 04:54:47,690
What was this one's riddle?

4257
04:54:55,380 --> 04:54:56,520
Blow up the floor?

4258
04:54:56,840 --> 04:54:57,940
No, there's nothing there.

4259
04:54:59,180 --> 04:55:00,720
No, Batman doesn't own everything.

4260
04:55:00,940 --> 04:55:05,020
Because for some fucking reason, Gotham has like 200 fucking
billionaires that live here.

4261
04:55:05,380 --> 04:55:09,520
Like every villain is either... Every villain or hero here
is either...

4262
04:55:10,200 --> 04:55:15,980
It's either a billionaire, villain, or a billionaire hero.

4263
04:55:17,980 --> 04:55:18,320
What?

4264
04:55:19,740 --> 04:55:21,140
I hear people.

4265
04:55:21,240 --> 04:55:21,980
Oh, there they are.

4266
04:55:23,080 --> 04:55:25,460
It's a new Silicon Valley.

4267
04:55:27,960 --> 04:55:28,260
Alright.

4268
04:55:28,940 --> 04:55:29,640
Hoop, hoop.

4269
04:55:29,800 --> 04:55:30,920
Oh, wait, that's not what I wanted.

4270
04:55:31,500 --> 04:55:31,660
Hoop.

4271
04:55:32,880 --> 04:55:33,760
There we go.

4272
04:55:34,380 --> 04:55:35,340
Get down over here.

4273
04:55:36,540 --> 04:55:36,620
Nice.

4274
04:55:42,850 --> 04:55:43,670
There's a vent.

4275
04:55:43,830 --> 04:55:44,230
It's in the vent.

4276
04:55:44,250 --> 04:55:44,530
vent?

4277
04:55:44,770 --> 04:55:45,050
The ridder?

4278
04:55:46,370 --> 04:55:47,850
Okay, is it in this vent?

4279
04:55:49,170 --> 04:55:49,870
Ow, sorry.

4280
04:55:53,230 --> 04:55:54,590
Where's the ridder?

4281
04:56:04,300 --> 04:56:05,160
What's this?

4282
04:56:05,520 --> 04:56:06,200
Where am I?

4283
04:56:09,340 --> 04:56:10,760
I don't know where I am.

4284
04:56:11,920 --> 04:56:12,760
Where's this place?

4285
04:56:13,900 --> 04:56:15,140
Where the fuck am I?

4286
04:56:15,680 --> 04:56:18,600
Oh, I'm in this other event area.

4287
04:56:23,190 --> 04:56:25,150
Gotham City is either where all the rich people live.

4288
04:56:25,170 --> 04:56:29,150
or all the poor people if there's no middle class in Gotham
City.

4289
04:56:30,090 --> 04:56:32,350
You just think about it.

4290
04:56:39,230 --> 04:56:39,610
Alright.

4291
04:56:39,870 --> 04:56:41,890
I don't know where the riddle is for this one.

4292
04:56:42,070 --> 04:56:42,670
Oh well.

4293
04:56:45,030 --> 04:56:47,390
I think we have to go back this way.

4294
04:56:50,530 --> 04:56:51,550
Alex, thank you for the super chat.

4306
04:57:21,310 --> 04:57:24,270

4307
04:57:25,470 --> 04:57:26,830

04:58:45,350 --> 04:58:47,710

4323
04:58:49,910 --> 04:58:50,790
Here we go.

4324
04:58:51,310 --> 04:58:52,070
This is it.

4325
04:58:53,490 --> 04:58:54,350

Oh, thank fucking God.

4329
04:58:59,070 --> 04:59:01,930

area again.

4330
04:59:02,210 --> 04:59:02,590
Okay.

4331
04:59:03,450 --> 04:59:05,070

04:59:06,430 --> 04:59:09,370
Tomato PC upgrade fun.

4334
04:59:21,890 --> 04:59:24,330
Okay, it's either getting hurt by Batman or getting hurt.

4335
04:59:24,390 --> 04:59:26,930
I feel like I would get hurt by Joker rather than...

4336
04:59:26,930 --> 04:59:29,050
No, get hurt by Batman rather than Joker.

4337
04:59:29,510 --> 04:59:32,230
But Joker would actually make it slow and painful.

4338
04:59:35,010 --> 04:59:35,170
Heat.

4339
04:59:35,850 --> 04:59:35,970
Heat.

4340
04:59:39,050 --> 04:59:41,210
The year is 2055.

4341
04:59:41,810 --> 04:59:43,270
Doki is finally at the 5th.

4342
04:59:43,290 --> 04:59:44,750
10% of Batman.

4343
04:59:45,250 --> 04:59:46,710
Would this be the year?

4344
04:59:47,890 --> 04:59:49,510

4349
05:00:06,580 --> 05:00:07,700
The gun!

4350
05:00:08,440 --> 05:00:09,840
Oh my god.

4351
05:00:10,900 --> 05:00:12,160
I'll just kill him.

4352
05:00:14,000 --> 05:00:14,560
Ow!

4353
05:00:18,740 --> 05:00:19,840
It's the gun!

4354
05:00:20,660 --> 05:00:21,760
The gun guy!

4355
05:00:23,920 --> 05:00:24,560

4358
05:00:28,820 --> 05:00:29,700
It's okay.

4359
05:00:29,840 --> 05:00:30,480
We got the gun.

4360
05:00:31,280 --> 05:00:32,740
We got the gun, guys.

4361
05:00:33,560 --> 05:00:34,420
That's okay.

4362
05:00:34,880 --> 05:00:35,300
Okay.

4363
05:00:35,300 --> 05:00:39,380
We're good.

05:00:42,140 --> 05:00:42,400
We're okay.

4365
05:00:42,680 --> 05:00:43,000
We're okay.

4366
05:00:43,840 --> 05:00:44,520
We're okay.

4367
05:00:46,020 --> 05:00:48,040
Everything is fine.

4368
05:00:49,520 --> 05:00:51,220

05:00:51,500 --> 05:00:51,880
Welcome, welcome.

4370
05:00:52,420 --> 05:00:53,300
Jesus Christ!

4371
05:00:53,960 --> 05:00:54,440
Get away!

4372
05:00:55,760 --> 05:00:56,040

Okay.

Got it countered correctly.

4376
05:01:04,950 --> 05:01:05,770
Nice, alright.

4377
05:01:05,930 --> 05:01:06,390
Get him out.

4378
05:01:07,290 --> 05:01:08,190
No, what?

4379
05:01:08,330 --> 05:01:09,510
Are you- what?

4380
05:01:10,370 --> 05:01:11,510

4381
05:01:11,530 --> 05:01:12,170

4382
05:01:12,690 --> 05:01:13,210
I swear.

4383
05:01:13,430 --> 05:01:14,970
I know I got shinked.

4384
05:01:15,490 --> 05:01:17,010
I got fucking shinked.

4385
05:01:17,570 --> 05:01:19,270
I can't believe it.

4386
05:01:20,110 --> 05:01:22,250
I can't believe I got shaked.

4387
05:01:22,570 --> 05:01:23,810
Okay, I'll use the remote control.

4388
05:01:25,010 --> 05:01:25,650

05:01:25,730 --> 05:01:26,670

That's right.

4395
05:01:41,510 --> 05:01:42,690
You can't do it.

05:01:42,850 --> 05:01:43,110

The shake is not good.

Okay, nice.

4424
05:03:09,930 --> 05:03:12,310
I messed up the combo for that, but that's okay.

4425
05:03:13,590 --> 05:03:14,270
That's alright.

4426
05:03:14,530 --> 05:03:17,050

05:03:56,850 --> 05:03:57,710
Hacking time.

the ham asylum?

4468
05:04:55,640 --> 05:04:55,880

05:05:05,400 --> 05:05:10,520
Getting camped however the Rizu won't stop any further aside
from being effective in this location.

05:05:10,720 --> 05:05:11,820
Wait, what do we do?

4474
05:05:15,060 --> 05:05:15,780
Far right?

4475
05:05:16,040 --> 05:05:16,640

4476
05:05:16,820 --> 05:05:18,180

I'm glad you enjoyed that stream.

4494
05:05:40,020 --> 05:05:46,280
I've been, like, bumping into, like, a lot of fucking, like,
not fan interactions, but, like, a lot of random

4495
05:05:46,280 --> 05:05:46,920
interaction.

4496
05:05:47,100 --> 05:05:47,740
It's been funny.

4497
05:05:49,200 --> 05:05:52,560
The amount of random interactions I've been getting in
voice.

4498
05:05:57,590 --> 05:05:58,310
Nico Maioshi.

4499
05:05:58,830 --> 05:06:00,350
He's not even single!

4500
05:06:03,910 --> 05:06:05,830
Wait, oh wait, there's something over there.

4501
05:06:09,410 --> 05:06:09,810
What's that?

4502
05:06:09,890 --> 05:06:10,830
Oh, there's tape.

4503
05:06:34,730 --> 05:06:37,570
I can love him from a fire!

4504
05:06:47,350 --> 05:06:53,710
If you see him, you wait long enough, he will eventually be
seen.

4505
05:06:57,570 --> 05:07:01,490
Guys, guys, please love yourself.

05:17:51,300 --> 05:17:52,600
Oh my god.

4708
05:17:53,100 --> 05:17:54,960
I got one guide so hard.

4709
05:17:56,380 --> 05:17:58,020
They would always exist.

4710
05:17:58,300 --> 05:17:59,580
But at least it's easier now.

4711
05:18:01,240 --> 05:18:04,720
At least it's so much easier now.

4712
05:18:05,680 --> 05:18:06,760
Oh my god.

You've got actually several hours of the game left, by the
way.

4763
05:21:06,790 --> 05:21:09,070
So it's okay to stop here if need be.

4764
05:21:09,690 --> 05:21:10,490

How much more do I have?

4770

05:21:35,760 --> 05:21:36,780
Ah, fuck, okay.

4777
05:21:38,540 --> 05:21:40,780
I still have two boss battles left.

4778
05:21:41,220 --> 05:21:42,640
One, at least two?

4779
05:21:44,780 --> 05:21:46,480

05:21:48,300 --> 05:21:49,120
I can do that.

4783
05:21:49,680 --> 05:21:50,820
That's fucking easy.

4784
05:21:51,680 --> 05:21:53,180
Okay, I need to figure out how to do this, though.

4785
05:21:54,040 --> 05:21:55,400

4786
05:21:58,260 --> 05:21:59,180

Alright.

4796
05:22:48,520 --> 05:22:50,040
We'll get out of this area.

4797
05:22:50,140 --> 05:22:51,340
We'll do the last part.

4798
05:22:51,920 --> 05:22:55,500
We'll do the last part another time.

4799
05:22:57,060 --> 05:22:58,380
We need to get outside.

4800
05:22:58,620 --> 05:23:02,000
Okay, we'll get outside and then we'll call it here.

4801
05:23:06,620 --> 05:23:07,000
Alright.

4802
05:23:11,040 --> 05:23:11,860
Now we're outside.

4803
05:23:12,060 --> 05:23:12,960
Wait, is that...

4804
05:23:12,960 --> 05:23:13,560

4805
05:23:13,840 --> 05:23:14,020
Okay.

4806
05:23:14,040 --> 05:23:15,000
That might be getting stronger.

4807
05:23:15,380 --> 05:23:18,800
We'll go to the next area and then we'll call it here.

4808
05:23:19,240 --> 05:23:21,100
We'll go to the next area.

4809
05:23:21,140 --> 05:23:22,360
You'll be walking into a trap.

4810
05:23:22,740 --> 05:23:24,160
That's what she thinks.

4811
05:23:26,380 --> 05:23:28,120
Oh wait, actually we can like do this.

4812
05:23:28,920 --> 05:23:30,680

4813
05:23:30,680 --> 05:23:32,880
Uh, let's go to the...

4814
05:23:32,880 --> 05:23:34,120
Easter egg first.

4815
05:23:36,860 --> 05:23:37,400
Twist!

4816
05:23:39,400 --> 05:23:41,900
This island belongs to me now.

4817
05:23:43,340 --> 05:23:44,460
Oh, is that Ivy?

4818
05:23:45,380 --> 05:23:47,420
It almost says literally an hour.

4819
05:23:47,560 --> 05:23:48,600
I don't...

4820
05:23:48,600 --> 05:23:49,380

4821
05:23:51,620 --> 05:23:53,740
Oh shit, there's four of you guys!

4822
05:23:55,200 --> 05:23:56,980
You know, I think that's a good time to call it.

4823
05:24:03,080 --> 05:24:03,700
It's alright.

4824
05:24:03,800 --> 05:24:05,920
The game decided this is where I'm ending.

4825
05:24:06,400 --> 05:24:06,980
It's okay.

4826
05:24:07,040 --> 05:24:08,300
The game...

4827
05:24:13,760 --> 05:24:15,720
We let the game decide.

4828
05:24:16,560 --> 05:24:17,360
We let...

4829
05:24:17,360 --> 05:24:18,680
It's okay, guys.

4830
05:24:18,860 --> 05:24:21,860
We just let the game decide to call me a year.

4831
05:24:22,340 --> 05:24:25,320
Like a game said, the stream is over.

4832
05:24:28,540 --> 05:24:29,620
