1
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:53,450
Everybody!

2
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:55,850
Hey, guys!

3
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:56,810
Oh, my gosh.

4
00:02:57,450 --> 00:02:57,450
Okay.

5
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:01,650
Whoa, Batman!

6
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:03,210
Today's the day.

7
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:05,550
We will be finishing Batman.

8
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:07,170
Finally.

9
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:13,910
Also, guys, I don't know if you guys noticed this, but do I
look a little different to you?

10
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:22,550
So for those who don't know, I have a... I was raised...

11
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:25,690
by a single parent, i.e.

12
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:27,130
I only have one.

13
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:29,050
Okay, not for real single.

14
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:33,730
I meant like this skin suit.

15
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:41,730
Okay, I have a mom and a dad, but for this skin suit, I only
have one mama.

16
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:47,050
I don't have a, I don't have a papa because my mama is my
papa.

17
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:47,750
So

18
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:53,910
This skin suit.

19
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:56,290
My mama is my papa.

20
00:03:57,170 --> 00:04:10,550
So, uh, yesterday, yesterday my mama papa, uh, um, did a
little bit of some refurbishing for my skin suit because my

21
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:13,010
skin suit was very, very old.

22
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:22,490
So now, now if you guys follow me on Twitter, you might have
noticed I.

23
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:29,350
I posted a little picture on the Twitter because I can do
this now.

24
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:36,540
I can do this now.

25
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,120
It's so good!

26
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:49,100

Did you guys know you can name your play button anything?

39
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:13,200
And I was like, there's no way.

40
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:18,840
There's no way they would let me name my play button, Doki
Bird, FPS VTuber.

41
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,080
Because VTuber, TTV, YouTube, Facebook.

00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:25,080
I saw it.

43
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:25,600
It was there.

44
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,860
It was actually there.

45
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:29,500
And I was like, holy shit, there is a way.

00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:34,760
A fucking course.

00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,020
Also, another, there's so many updates.

50
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:51,500
Oh my gosh, there's so many updates I have to give you guys.

00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:59,420
Um, but I was talking to like, for those who aren't into

besties are gonna be competing in algs challenger circuit i

63
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:55,840

64
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:58,440
way to the semi-finals.

65
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:04,240
Anyway, so I think it's like either next week or the week
after that.

66
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:11,780
We're just going to see what Wig's schedule is going to be
like, because it's all dependent on him, since he's like the

67
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:13,580
busy one out of the three of us.

68
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,640
I was also invited to the Apex invitation.

69
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:30,780
For those who don't know, there is a invitation, they just
recently announced the Nessie Cup Invitationals in NA, and I

70
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:40,060
was invited to participate in at least one of them, because,
well, to be fair, it's more so, I was like, tempo, can I

71
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:40,420
join?

72
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:41,360
And he's like, yeah.

73
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:49,640
So, like, that was basically how it went.

74
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:55,180
because I was like oh hey I just saw this can I join yeah
you can I was like sweet

75
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:02,160
so so I'm gonna be there too

76
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:12,320
um for and it's I don't even know if I'm gonna win any money
but it was like 25 000 or something I don't know it was like

77
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:19,680
wait let me see where if I could find the um let me see if I
could find like the details of it it's like something i just

78
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:30,880
saw it pop up on my twitter and i was like can i join yeah
you can i'm like cool yeah all right apex legends nesting

79
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:41,180
cup oh yeah yeah it's 25 what is it holy shit okay each
event wait it's 50 000 holy fuck okay apparently each event

80
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:43,660
is $50,000 prize pool.

81
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,060
It's like mini games too.

82
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,220
Which is the best part?

83
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,640
It's like, and there's like three of them.

84
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:55,240
So I asked if I could join like at least one of them.

85
00:10:55,720 --> 00:11:02,440
So I wanted to do the mini games one because like there's
like hide and seek and stuff like that and like fisting,

86
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:03,900
like punching people out.

87
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:08,520
And I was like, I rather do the ones where I can like not
actually shoot my gun.

88
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,160
And that's fine with me.

89
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:20,880
because there's like there's like three different
invitations the second one is like where you actually have

90
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:27,020
to shoot your gun and play as a team but the first
invitational and the third invitational is like you get to

91
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:33,000
fuck around and you can you don't have to like actually
shoot your gun so i was like i would like to be in either of

92
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,080
those for that sweet 50k

93
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:56,960
to shoot my gun sign me up so yeah so those are like the
apex updates for uh for like for i don't when is the first

94
00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:03,740
one again that one is on march 7th so i might be on the
march 7th one i'm not sure yeah i'm just waiting for i'm

95
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:10,940
just waiting for uh i'm just waiting for like to know which
one I'm going to be in but there's gonna be no it's a 50k

96
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:19,040
prize pool of course it's not per person what the fuck I
just like I feel like that it was like per person like I

97
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:26,620
feel like that money would be used instead to improve apex
more I do not think that they would be willing to give 50k

98
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:32,740
per person in a random tournament I'd rather have that money
be used in apex legends in general and just improve the game

99
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:39,220
Super chat, thank you, thank you.

100
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,480

00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,460

Of course not.

104
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:46,940

00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,260
My babies know your every move.

Ow!

161
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:51,320
arrogant enough to think you could have Ow!

You will fail And we We will become the most powerful Force
on the planet Who's we?

163
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,660
You think the Joker Gives a fuck about you, Ivy?

164
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:06,640
He's always a solo act.

165
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:08,440
He barely gives a fuck about Harley.

166
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:13,080
He's always like Selling Harley off to the next guy.

167
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,380
You think you're gonna Be different, Ivy?

168
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:22,460
You're just delaying me I can fix her.

169
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:26,500
Oh.

170
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:31,340
Oh, she's talking about her and the plants.

171
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,900
Oh, that makes more sense.

172
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:35,680
Yeah, it's gonna be like, who the fuck is we?

173
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:37,620
Oh.

00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,760
I'll make sure I fist every plant around me.

175
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:47,820
The other sniper, I'm gonna pretend, if I don't look at the
other sniper, he doesn't exist.

176
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:53,420
If you don't acknowledge the problem, it'll eventually go
away, right?

177
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:57,880
You will pay Batman for hurting my babies.

178
00:16:58,140 --> 00:17:00,080
What if they're into this thing?

179
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:08,100
When I finish with Batman, I'll be coming after you, Joker.

180
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:10,180
Will you really?

181
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,140
Oh, that's gratitude.

182
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:16,860
You give him presents, experimental- Whoa!

183
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:20,400
Whoa!

184
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:21,620
Joker!

185
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:25,160
Ow.

186
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:27,180
Where the fuck shot?

187
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:28,240

00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,180

Who, ow!

195
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:49,350
I salute my fallen enemy!

196
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:51,710
Oh, my God.

197
00:17:52,630 --> 00:18:07,750
I supposed to know no okay at least I get to fist these
plants again you will pay Batman for hurting my babies when

198
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:18,690

waiting I can't grapple there's too many people talking

199
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:22,350

00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:32,550
All right, I still hit him.

201
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:34,590
It's gonna be like, I miss.

202
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:38,470
Where?

203
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:39,810
Where, no!

204
00:18:41,210 --> 00:18:43,230
If I keep running, you can't catch me!

205
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:44,590
I'll just keep dodging.

206
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:46,070
I'll just keep dodging.

207
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:47,270
I have no stamina.

208
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:47,950
It's 2010!

209
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:48,570
Ow.

210
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:50,130
It's okay.

211
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:51,270
We can hack this.

212
00:18:53,810 --> 00:18:54,230
All right.

213
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:55,970
It's 2010.

214
00:18:56,090 --> 00:18:57,310
There's no stamina in this game.

215
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:58,290
I can dodge forever.

216
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:00,750
Look, how the fuck do I?

217
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:05,450
I need to remember how to hack again.

218
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:06,790
Please.

219
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:13,470
Where's the green?

220
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:14,430
Oh, there it is.

221
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:15,990
I really don't want...

222
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:17,790
I'm too lazy to walk around.

223
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:21,590
Ooh.

224
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:22,930
Interview tape.

225
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:24,350
Tape page and interview 20.

226
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:53,320
Scared?

227
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:54,560
Yes, scared.

228
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,480
There's obviously something.

229
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,880
Something that made you what you are.

230
00:19:59,020 --> 00:19:59,760
What if...

231
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,000
What if I'm too scared?

232
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:02,860
No!

233
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:05,220
Don't make him trauma dump!

234
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:07,520
You're gonna fall in love!

235
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,240
No!

236
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:19,480
Don't you remember what happened to Harley?

237
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:22,460
The moment he starts trauma dumping, it's over!

238
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:25,400
It's so fucking over!

239
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:31,760
I wonder if there's anything at the...

240
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:33,320
Oh, can I scan this?

241
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:34,200
No, I can scan this.

242
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:36,060
I thought there would be something here.

243
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:37,600
Wait, how do I get inside here?

244
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:41,140
You're gonna...

245
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:43,540
You're gonna be like, I can fix him!

246
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,400
And it'll be over!

247
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,400
It'll be over for you!

248
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,740
Thank you for the super chat.

249
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:51,800
Thank you, thank you.

250
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,480
So that's how it works.

251
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:56,440
Red Pixel, thank you for the super chat.

252
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:56,740
Thank you, thank you.

253
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:57,420
Thank you.

254
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:58,040
Hi, Doki.

255
00:20:58,380 --> 00:20:59,200
Congrats on the play button.

256
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:03,860
I wonder if it's possible that the name take up the entire
width of the plaque for the next one.

257
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:04,840
I don't know.

258
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:13,380
If I ever get a million, I'm just, like, thinking if I
should, like, if I should add more to it or just do Doki

259
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:13,720
Bird.

260
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:20,420
I was like, do I, I mean, the best thing about it is that
you can technically, you can buy, like, unlimited play

261
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:20,960
buttons.

262
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:23,420
It's, like, around, like, a hundred.

263
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:32,080
I remember it was, like, it was, like, I remember the Aston
about it before it was like two hundred dollars i think you

264
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:39,460
can buy like unlimited play button so it's not like they
said they send you the first one for free and then they um

265
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:50,040
and then the the rest you can you can pay for extra copies
so i'm just like do i actually get a real one do i keep I

266
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,700
keep adding more to it.

267
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:56,240
Let's see.

268
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:57,340
Can I go over?

269
00:21:58,340 --> 00:21:58,880
It's me.

270
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:05,820
I mean, good for you for the photosynthesis.

271
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:09,500
I mean, we need more trees for oxygen.

272
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:11,420
So, like, good on you, Ivy.

273
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,160
Good on you.

274
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:15,320
Oh, hey.

275
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:16,840
Need that, actually.

276
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:19,380
New brick.

277
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:31,180
metal and paint covered old wounds fresh blood was injected
into the body bright new minds came and all swore to uphold

278
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:43,060
our promises we all knew we were the ones to fix this city
and the city would thank us and tom thank you for the super

279
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:49,660
chat thank you thank you so you're saying if we super chat
you $200, we can request a new play button for your

280
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:50,520
collection.

281
00:22:51,140 --> 00:23:07,720
Um, like, in theory, yes, in theory, I could, if you, if you
like, you know, super chat me $200, in theory, I could order

282
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:10,760
a play button if I wanted to.

283
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:19,300
I could technically just decorate an entire wall with just
like silver play buttons that you've like sent me money to

284
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:28,760
buy for in theory yes chat personalized play button because
the thing is the reason why they do this is because like if

285
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:35,940
your channel is owned by like multiple people so you can
like buy more play buttons for the rest of the people in

286
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:48,580
your like youtube team so in theory i could be like you guys
are part of my x amount of play buttons and just name it

287
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:57,040
just name it in with whatever suggestions you give me and
just order like i don't know like 20 of them of different

288
00:23:57,040 --> 00:24:04,240
fucking names yes in theory we could do this but the best
thing about this is that this is all theoretical

289
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:13,380
Stephen towards the play button thank you for the super chat
thank you thank you

290
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:19,580
Yes, this is all theoretical, guys.

291
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:21,900
It is possible.

292
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,140

333
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:05,020
All right.

334
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:12,320
We will make a community post after this stream for all you

337
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:49,680

339
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:54,760
I won't let you destroy it, Batman.

340
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:58,080
Wait, she's not swole!

341
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,060
What's the point?

342
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:04,140
Now I realize they were evolving.

343
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:05,920
Growing stronger.

344
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,720
What's the point if she's not swole?

345
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:14,400
Why doesn't the Bane Juice make her swole?

346
00:28:22,290 --> 00:28:23,910
Holy fuck, what?

347
00:28:28,410 --> 00:28:31,390
This looks so wrong.

348
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:32,910
Okay, I don't know how to...

349
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:33,470
What do I do?

350
00:28:34,010 --> 00:28:34,930
What the fuck do I do?

351
00:28:35,770 --> 00:28:36,110
Oh, God.

352
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:36,690
What do I do?

353
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:37,190
Batarang?

354
00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:39,470
Batarang?

355
00:28:39,930 --> 00:28:42,450
What do I do?

356
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:45,070
Okay.

357
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:47,470
Is it Batarang time?

358
00:28:48,550 --> 00:28:49,230
Batarang.

359
00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:50,850
Batarang.

360
00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:53,090
Oh, shit, it is Baderang!

361
00:28:54,970 --> 00:28:55,270
Baderang!

362
00:28:55,430 --> 00:28:56,030
Oh, fuck.

363
00:28:56,590 --> 00:28:57,410
Okay, it's Baderang.

364
00:28:58,590 --> 00:28:59,550
Oh, it's the Baderang.

365
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:01,310
Okay, open your mouth, Ivy.

366
00:29:03,770 --> 00:29:04,250
Baderang!

367
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:06,730
Wait, I can do two Baderangs.

368
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:07,930
Whoa.

369
00:29:09,650 --> 00:29:10,130
Alright.

370
00:29:10,670 --> 00:29:11,230

371
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:12,810

372
00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:13,310

373
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:13,610

Okay, only one Baderang, apparently.

375
00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:20,070
I can only do one Baderang at a time.

376
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:21,670
The four...

00:29:21,770 --> 00:29:24,850

00:31:07,770 --> 00:31:09,890

Thank God.

439
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:34,640

00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:38,140
Boop.

441
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:39,120
Concussion.

We're okay.

443
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:46,760
Jokey Bird confirmed hate environment activist.

444
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:47,740
Hey, hey.

445
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:52,100
I was president of my environmental club.

446
00:33:53,880 --> 00:34:01,920
I don't know how I became president, but like, I was But
thank you for this super chat.

00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:02,240
Thank you.

448
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:03,220
Thank you, Tom.

449
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:15,220
Look, it's, it's still, it was still, it was still in my
college application, so it counts.

450
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:24,100
You know, like, I was that type of Asian that basically
signed up for anything, for, like, everything, so I can,

451
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:25,880
like, boost up my college application.

452
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,460
Like, you might not believe.

453
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:29,600
I want to save the environment.

454
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,620
The environment is very, very important.

455
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:37,760
But, like, you know, you're not like, like, you know, the
environmental person.

456
00:34:40,610 --> 00:34:48,100
You know, I cared about the environment, but not to the
extent where I should have been the president.

457
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:55,520
It just looked really good on my college applications.

458
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,000
Also, uh...

459
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:59,420

00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:05,280
Yes, that's better.

465
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:08,200
I cared enough about the environment.

466
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:10,080
Okay.

467
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,460
Where's the worth it in the end?

468
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:12,960
I mean, I got to college.

469
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:17,280
And then I became a V-tuber and didn't use my degree for
this.

470
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:19,280
So, like, yeah.

471
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:22,120
Hey, hey.

472
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:24,340
It was Canadian college.

473
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:28,060
So, it's, you know, so, like, the tuition fee.

474
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:31,220
was not as bad as American college.

475
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:35,700
Alright, like, at least it was Canadian college.

476
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:38,340
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

she got another upgrade.

509
00:38:03,570 --> 00:38:05,670
Alright, let's upgrade.

510
00:38:05,930 --> 00:38:07,750
We have...

511
00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:08,030
Oh.

512
00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:08,970
No!

513
00:38:09,210 --> 00:38:09,870
Don't...

514
00:38:11,350 --> 00:38:13,210
Okay, okay.

515
00:38:13,790 --> 00:38:15,770
At least it crashed after.

516
00:38:16,370 --> 00:38:18,350
At least it's after.

517
00:38:19,690 --> 00:38:22,050
That's all that matters.

518
00:38:24,890 --> 00:38:28,170
It crashed after the fight.

519
00:38:28,650 --> 00:38:29,510
Oh, thank God.

520
00:38:30,010 --> 00:38:30,730
Oh, thank God.

521
00:38:30,890 --> 00:38:32,110
I was going to be so sad.

522
00:38:33,070 --> 00:38:35,210
Thank God it wasn't in the middle of the Ivy fight.

523
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:36,830
Oh, thank God.

524
00:38:37,570 --> 00:38:37,830
All right.

525
00:38:37,970 --> 00:38:38,770
It should have saved.

526
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:39,650
It should have saved.

527
00:38:40,010 --> 00:38:41,910
We just had to listen to Joker talk again.

528
00:38:42,210 --> 00:38:42,750
That's okay.

529
00:38:46,110 --> 00:38:46,790
All right.

530
00:38:47,670 --> 00:38:48,450
It's all right.

531
00:38:49,130 --> 00:38:49,690
It's all right.

532
00:38:49,790 --> 00:38:50,770
We're almost there.

533
00:38:51,330 --> 00:38:52,850
We're almost at the finale.

534
00:38:54,410 --> 00:38:55,230
We just need...

535
00:38:55,230 --> 00:38:57,830
We just have one more boss left, apparently.

536
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:02,760
Alright, let's go.

537
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:05,680
I forgot what I was talking about.

538
00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:10,090
Alright, here we go.

539
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:20,040
The crash.

540
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:21,240
My biggest boss.

541
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:22,940
Ta-da!

542
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:25,440
That's me!

543
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:26,580
Where'd I go?

544
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:32,600
Okay, I have to wait until he tells us me what to do for

545
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:54,180

548
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:20,540
Oh but guys what a three batter guys why didn't you tell me

549
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:39,700
You know I don't fucking read I was expecting you guys to
help me to the best upgrades But, but Doki, two is, three is

550
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:40,480
better than two.

551
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,780
Guys, we don't need more batarangs.

552
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:44,900
We don't need more batarangs.

553
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:47,380
Fine, we'll have more batarangs.

554
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:48,480
Fine.

555
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:50,720
Three is better than two.

556
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:53,780
All right, where do I go?

557
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,120
Where the fuck's the party?

558
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:58,220
Three are right.

559
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:01,860
Guys, we could have made the hacking easier.

560
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:03,320
What do you mean?

561
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:05,020
I mean...

562
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:09,080
I would have struggled so hard trying to hack.

563
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:13,920
Does someone say more, Batarans?

564
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:16,500
I swear to fucking God.

565
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:19,280
Alright, let's get these guys out of here.

566
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:22,380
Alright.

567
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:24,240
Well, it's not really...

568
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:26,240
It can't have more brain damage, right?

569
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:29,580
They're already lost causes, I feel like.

570
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:33,700
Unless Batman, you know, starts funding the medical...

571
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,140
In the city?

572
00:41:39,910 --> 00:41:43,250
I still can't believe Batman was Big Pharma this entire
time.

573
00:41:44,450 --> 00:41:46,310
No wonder everybody's crazy here.

574
00:41:47,570 --> 00:41:49,030
This is how he makes his money.

575
00:41:50,270 --> 00:41:52,350
But the TV is joking.

576
00:41:56,450 --> 00:41:57,530
What's that?

577
00:41:58,970 --> 00:42:00,370
What's going on over there?

578
00:42:01,470 --> 00:42:02,170
What is that?

579
00:42:04,210 --> 00:42:05,210
What does that say?

580
00:42:05,790 --> 00:42:06,590
Monster cell?

581
00:42:06,650 --> 00:42:08,490
Oh my god!

582
00:42:09,990 --> 00:42:11,510
Oh my god!

583
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:12,970
This is it!

584
00:42:13,650 --> 00:42:14,570
Hey guys.

585
00:42:15,870 --> 00:42:18,730
If your name's not on the list, you ain't going in.

586
00:42:18,970 --> 00:42:20,170
But it's me, Batman!

587
00:42:20,670 --> 00:42:22,730
Let's see, yeah, A, no it's not right.

588
00:42:23,110 --> 00:42:25,730
B, B, Bane.

589
00:42:26,790 --> 00:42:28,170
Ah, here it is.

590
00:42:28,270 --> 00:42:30,750
That's right, I should get VIP right now.

591
00:42:30,910 --> 00:42:31,390
Hey!

592
00:42:32,690 --> 00:42:34,330
I'm the guest of honor?

593
00:42:35,610 --> 00:42:38,170
Give him a big Welcome, guys.

594
00:42:38,910 --> 00:42:39,310
It's me.

595
00:42:39,550 --> 00:42:40,110
I'm special.

596
00:42:43,070 --> 00:42:43,490
Yay!

597
00:42:45,130 --> 00:42:46,090
Oh, my God!

598
00:42:46,850 --> 00:42:48,290
Guys, how do you know it's my birthday?

599
00:42:48,990 --> 00:42:50,470
Because every day is my birthday.

600
00:42:52,770 --> 00:42:53,270
Yay!

601
00:42:54,410 --> 00:42:56,630
Happy birthday to me.

602
00:42:57,390 --> 00:42:59,830
Happy birthday to me.

603
00:43:00,170 --> 00:43:00,350
What?

604
00:43:01,390 --> 00:43:02,350
Where's the birthdays?

605
00:43:03,730 --> 00:43:03,990
Hello?

606
00:43:05,290 --> 00:43:06,110
Birthday?

607
00:43:07,450 --> 00:43:09,250
Are you excited, Max?

608
00:43:09,710 --> 00:43:09,950
Yeah?

609
00:43:10,130 --> 00:43:12,790
I mean, we've been building up to this point all night.

610
00:43:13,750 --> 00:43:17,230
Don't tell me you've not been looking forward to it.

611
00:43:18,630 --> 00:43:20,230
I know I have.

612
00:43:20,330 --> 00:43:21,050
Where's the cake?

613
00:43:22,610 --> 00:43:23,150
Oh!

614
00:43:24,910 --> 00:43:27,550
Everyone always said I should be in television.

615
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:29,490
You don't want to miss this.

616
00:43:29,770 --> 00:43:30,150
Really?

617
00:43:30,790 --> 00:43:32,250
It'll be a blast.

618
00:43:32,350 --> 00:43:34,310
Oh my god, you were here this entire time?

619
00:43:35,310 --> 00:43:35,850
Nine.

620
00:43:37,370 --> 00:43:41,870
8 Wait, where are you going?

621
00:43:42,910 --> 00:43:43,830
Wait, wait a minute.

622
00:43:44,370 --> 00:43:44,990
Wait a minute.

623
00:43:45,810 --> 00:43:47,970
Oh, oh!

624
00:43:51,250 --> 00:43:52,530
Wait a minute.

625
00:43:53,190 --> 00:43:54,350
Is that a bomb?

626
00:44:01,670 --> 00:44:05,810
Oh hey, I like how the blast put me closer to the room.

627
00:44:06,390 --> 00:44:08,030
It like sucked me back in.

The saddest thing is you know Harley would pay for it too.

634
00:45:21,540 --> 00:45:23,740
That's like the saddest thing.

635
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:27,780
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

636
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:29,300
All right, that's fine.

00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:30,380
We will...

638
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:32,380
We'll get on top of this guy.

639
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,000
Oh, God, oh, God, no!

640
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:35,740
Fuck!

641
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:37,400
Oh, get away from me, get away from me!

642
00:45:38,180 --> 00:45:39,140
That's all right, there's friendly...

643
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:42,240
I...

644
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:43,600
Please...

645
00:45:44,380 --> 00:45:45,280
Please, game.

646
00:45:47,580 --> 00:45:49,680
Please, we were so...

647
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:50,460
Please!

648
00:45:55,890 --> 00:45:57,430
Please, let me out!

649
00:45:58,230 --> 00:45:59,550
Let me out!

650
00:46:03,570 --> 00:46:07,010
I just want to beat the Batman.

651
00:46:07,870 --> 00:46:09,890
I just want to beat Batman.

652
00:46:13,410 --> 00:46:15,750
Perfectly optimized game.

653
00:46:16,470 --> 00:46:25,790
Guys, it can't mostly be my PC is also because this game is
very old and the older games are rarely ever optimized for

654
00:46:25,790 --> 00:46:26,890
newer PCs.

655
00:46:28,050 --> 00:46:35,090
Guys, look, my PC might be a tomato, but like, you can't
fully blame it on my PC.

656
00:46:38,310 --> 00:46:39,910
This game needs a remake?

657
00:46:40,110 --> 00:46:40,750
I don't know.

658
00:46:40,970 --> 00:46:42,590
I don't trust remakes anymore.

659
00:46:43,550 --> 00:46:46,210
Unless, I mean, like, Dead Space is like one of the rare
remakes.

660
00:46:46,230 --> 00:46:48,550
Remakes that actually, like, ow.

661
00:46:48,690 --> 00:46:49,990
Oh, okay, that didn't hit me.

662
00:46:50,150 --> 00:46:50,730
That's great.

663
00:46:54,190 --> 00:46:59,450
Dead Space is, like, one of the rare, rare remakes that,
like, are actually, they actually...

664
00:46:59,450 --> 00:47:00,150
Oh, nice!

665
00:47:00,330 --> 00:47:01,470
He's better at bullying than me.

666
00:47:05,770 --> 00:47:06,990
Oh, fuck, okay.

667
00:47:09,830 --> 00:47:11,210
They already got a remake?

668
00:47:11,490 --> 00:47:13,230
This is the Game of the Year version.

669
00:47:13,570 --> 00:47:15,150
Wait, when did they get a remake?

670
00:47:15,810 --> 00:47:16,210
Wait.

671
00:47:18,470 --> 00:47:19,450
All right, nice.

672
00:47:19,750 --> 00:47:20,210
Got it.

673
00:47:23,950 --> 00:47:25,270
No, no, no, no, no, no, fuck.

674
00:47:27,330 --> 00:47:28,750
This will hurt.

675
00:47:29,850 --> 00:47:30,710
They're lying.

676
00:47:31,310 --> 00:47:32,290
Console only.

677
00:47:32,470 --> 00:47:33,170
God damn it.

678
00:47:33,310 --> 00:47:34,590
It's always console only.

679
00:47:36,010 --> 00:47:38,070
Too lazy to play this on console.

680
00:47:38,290 --> 00:47:39,970
Why can't everything be on Steam?

681
00:47:41,070 --> 00:47:43,090
Dude, fuck console exclusives, man.

682
00:47:43,310 --> 00:47:45,250
I hate console exclusives so much.

683
00:47:46,770 --> 00:47:48,070
There's no point!

684
00:47:49,570 --> 00:47:51,130
There's no fucking point!

685
00:47:52,930 --> 00:47:53,150
Oling!

686
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:00,800
Console exclusive is fucking stupid, I'm gonna say it.

687
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:04,400
Because eventually, nothing is ever console exclusive.

688
00:48:04,620 --> 00:48:06,660
Eventually, everything comes back to Steam.

689
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:12,500
Wow, Alex, you're very hurtful.

690
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:14,920
Everything eventually gets on Steam.

691
00:48:15,020 --> 00:48:16,820
There's no such thing as console exclusive.

692
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:27,500
all the bait it's all the fucking bait except for nintendo
switch stuff because like it's harder to like port things

693
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:38,340
from the switch to pc all right nice i'm just gonna use
these guys as bowling for a little bit all right nice thank

bloodborne will get ported to seem it's just Just like, it

695
00:48:48,740 --> 00:48:49,700

696
00:48:51,140 --> 00:48:51,740
Uh...

697
00:48:51,740 --> 00:48:58,240
I feel like there has to be like some fucking contract right
now that's restricting it from hoarding it.

698
00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:01,020
But I feel like eventually it's gonna happen.

699
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:03,980
Okay, nice.

700
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:04,900

705
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:11,760
Nice.

It's time to...

707
00:49:13,060 --> 00:49:14,960
It's time to slap them.

708
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:17,020
It's time to slap your friends.

709
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:18,620
That's fucking right.

710
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:21,940
It's been a decade.

711
00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:25,360
I mean, eventually contracts run out, right?

712
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:27,160
Right, guys?

713
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:30,960
I feel like we're gonna see, like, a remake of Blood...

714
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:36,560
Maybe a remaster or a remake of Bloodborne on Steam or some
shit.

Okay, we just gotta leave.

756
00:52:22,460 --> 00:52:23,740
Okay, this will be easier now.

757
00:52:23,860 --> 00:52:25,700
Now that there's one, it'll be easier.

758
00:52:27,420 --> 00:52:29,360
It should be easier, theoretically.

759
00:52:30,100 --> 00:52:31,480
Theoretically, it should be easier.

760
00:52:32,940 --> 00:52:34,060
Alright, alright, alright, alright.

00:52:53,820 --> 00:52:54,880
I thought it was over.

773
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:56,540
I thought it was over.

774
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:57,860
I almost could have died.

775
00:52:59,700 --> 00:53:01,060
Nicely done, bats.

776
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:03,160
You deserve a prize.

777
00:53:03,340 --> 00:53:06,380
Your old pal, Commissioner Gordon.

778
00:53:06,860 --> 00:53:07,340
Gordon?

779
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:11,840
Say, he looks all run down.

780
00:53:12,340 --> 00:53:13,280
What happened, Gordon?

781
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:15,420
Wait, what?

782
00:53:16,460 --> 00:53:17,120

00:53:57,660 --> 00:54:00,920
Months of planning down the crapper.

788
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:10,200
I just wanted to bring down your grim facade and for once
let you see the world as I see it.

789
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:12,900
Giggling in a corner and bleeding.

790
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:15,640
But you've denied me even that.

791
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:18,720
I have nothing to live for.

792
00:54:18,740 --> 00:54:19,600
Oh shit!

793
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:24,520
That's actually scary.

794
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:27,940
Joker on Venom Juice.

You whispered that.

808
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:17,040
I like how... I like how the bane juice makes him have a
mohawk as if it affects his fucking hair.

809
00:55:20,830 --> 00:55:24,250
That's for inside voices, not outside voices.

00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:38,420
There's never a good time to counter!

839
00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:40,140
Oh shit.

840
00:58:40,300 --> 00:58:41,360
How do I get rid of this?

841
00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:42,460
How to get rid of teeth.

842
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:43,220
Teeth.

843
00:58:43,740 --> 00:58:44,620
Get away from me, teeth.

I just need to help the other one.

846
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:51,580
Use the middle stick to avoid the crashes.

847
00:58:54,940 --> 00:58:55,840
It's fine.

848
00:58:56,840 --> 00:58:57,360
We're fine.

849
00:58:57,720 --> 00:58:59,220
Now I can just why everything.

850
00:58:59,720 --> 00:59:00,500
Nope, never mind.

851
00:59:01,160 --> 00:59:01,720

852
00:59:01,900 --> 00:59:02,340

00:59:47,310 --> 00:59:48,670
Holy shit!

868
00:59:49,570 --> 00:59:54,510
Please beat Batman, we need you to beat Batman!

869
00:59:56,090 --> 00:59:57,590
Oh my god!

870
01:00:00,270 --> 01:00:01,930
Oh my god!

871
01:00:02,470 --> 01:00:05,510
Bro, my fucking thing is freaking out right now!

872
01:00:06,030 --> 01:00:09,030
Everything... Everything is freaking out!

873
01:00:09,810 --> 01:00:10,930
Holy shit!

874
01:00:11,650 --> 01:00:13,170
Oh my god!

875
01:00:14,310 --> 01:00:14,830
I don't know.

876
01:00:15,530 --> 01:00:16,770
I don't know if it's okay.

877
01:00:17,570 --> 01:00:20,750
Please get me out of this hell hole.

878
01:00:21,110 --> 01:00:22,470
Get me out.

879
01:00:22,470 --> 01:00:22,750
Ow!

880
01:00:27,510 --> 01:00:28,870
Oh shit.

881
01:00:30,150 --> 01:00:30,170
Please.

882
01:00:31,650 --> 01:00:33,330
Let me kill Batman.

883
01:00:34,930 --> 01:00:35,610
Let me kill Batman.

884
01:00:35,610 --> 01:00:35,890
I'm not Batman.

885
01:00:36,110 --> 01:00:37,150
Let me kill Joker.

886
01:00:38,270 --> 01:00:39,810
Oh my god.

887
01:00:41,430 --> 01:00:42,510
Wait, there's more?

888
01:00:42,890 --> 01:00:44,210
I think if you're not with me.

889
01:00:44,310 --> 01:00:45,190
Oh, God.

890
01:00:46,110 --> 01:00:46,830
Oh, God.

891
01:00:46,930 --> 01:00:48,150
Am I back in it?

892
01:00:48,270 --> 01:00:49,850
Use your imagination.

893
01:00:50,750 --> 01:00:52,310
Bro, we're in the back!

894
01:00:52,650 --> 01:00:53,150
Oh,

895
01:00:57,430 --> 01:00:57,550
shit.

896
01:00:57,930 --> 01:00:58,590
Where am I?

897
01:00:59,310 --> 01:01:00,970
Where am I?

898
01:01:02,410 --> 01:01:03,890
Oh, my God.

899
01:01:04,370 --> 01:01:05,230
Oh, my God.

900
01:01:05,350 --> 01:01:06,090
Give me a sec.

901
01:01:06,490 --> 01:01:07,450
Give me a sec.

902
01:01:07,750 --> 01:01:09,790
It's a journey right now.

903
01:01:10,010 --> 01:01:10,810
It's a journey.

904
01:01:14,010 --> 01:01:15,230
Holy shit.

905
01:01:16,530 --> 01:01:17,150

It's okay, we're fine.

915
01:02:45,950 --> 01:02:46,410
We're back.

916
01:02:47,230 --> 01:02:47,910
Use the bat claw.

917
01:02:48,070 --> 01:02:48,990
Okay, I figured it out.

918
01:02:49,970 --> 01:02:51,330
I figured it out, guys.

919
01:02:52,370 --> 01:02:54,050
I have to use the bat claw.

920
01:02:54,730 --> 01:02:57,510
For my pure intuition, I figured out how to kill Joker.

921
01:02:59,810 --> 01:03:00,970
Aw, this is me.

922
01:03:03,010 --> 01:03:03,450
What?

923
01:03:03,770 --> 01:03:04,050
Oh.

924
01:03:07,770 --> 01:03:09,510
Nice, I got him.

925
01:03:10,190 --> 01:03:11,590
I did it all by myself.

926
01:03:12,510 --> 01:03:13,210
Get down!

927
01:03:15,010 --> 01:03:16,850
My natural intuition.

928
01:03:17,410 --> 01:03:18,770
Without looking at chat.

929
01:03:19,990 --> 01:03:20,850
Boom, boom.

930
01:03:22,270 --> 01:03:23,090
That's fucking right.

931
01:03:23,170 --> 01:03:25,090
You're never gonna get out of this.

932
01:03:26,430 --> 01:03:26,810
What?

933
01:03:29,530 --> 01:03:29,690
Ooh.

934
01:03:31,210 --> 01:03:31,810
Ooh.

935
01:03:32,870 --> 01:03:33,150
Ow.

936
01:03:33,490 --> 01:03:35,390
Okay, can I run away from this?

937
01:03:39,100 --> 01:03:40,660
What if I just...

938
01:03:41,300 --> 01:03:42,160
Alright, round two.

939
01:03:42,760 --> 01:03:44,120
Oh my god, it's like Mario!

940
01:03:44,920 --> 01:03:46,280
Three hits and you're out!

941
01:03:47,820 --> 01:03:48,920
Okay, what if I...

942
01:03:48,920 --> 01:03:51,500
I have three battle rides right now.

943
01:03:52,920 --> 01:03:53,620
Alright, nice.

944
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:57,040
Oh shit!

945
01:03:58,840 --> 01:03:59,400
Nice.

946
01:04:00,560 --> 01:04:01,680
We're fine, we're fine.

947
01:04:01,840 --> 01:04:02,660
Everything is fine.

948
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:05,940
I'm doing all the combos necessary.

949
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:07,180
Boop!

950
01:04:09,340 --> 01:04:09,740
Okay.

951
01:04:10,600 --> 01:04:10,900
Look at that.

952
01:04:10,980 --> 01:04:11,740
I'm comboing!

953
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:12,980
Finally!

954
01:04:13,160 --> 01:04:15,500
It took me the rest of this game to learn how to combo!

955
01:04:18,660 --> 01:04:19,340
Oh god.

956
01:04:19,560 --> 01:04:20,480
Maybe my...

957
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:20,760
Yes.

958
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:21,020
Okay.

959
01:04:21,080 --> 01:04:23,740
I just need to bait these guys to kill him.

960
01:04:24,920 --> 01:04:25,340
Oh shit.

961
01:04:25,460 --> 01:04:25,640
Nope.

962
01:04:26,180 --> 01:04:26,720
No knife.

963
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:30,120
It's alright.

964
01:04:30,300 --> 01:04:30,780
We're good.

965
01:04:31,480 --> 01:04:32,660
We just have to keep...

966
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:35,440
We just gotta have to make sure we don't get hit.

967
01:04:36,360 --> 01:04:37,500
Everything will be fine.

968
01:04:38,680 --> 01:05:07,680
all right nice explode hold down just don't hit me no I'm so
close no why did you come down it's not fair it should be

969
01:05:07,680 --> 01:05:13,820
like a magical We're all cutscene where nothing interrupts
me when I transform into a magical girl, but instead nobody

970
01:05:13,820 --> 01:05:16,580
interrupts me when I fucking try to kill Joker.

971
01:05:18,580 --> 01:05:19,820
There's no etiquette.

972
01:05:20,700 --> 01:05:23,140
I can't believe it.

973
01:05:24,020 --> 01:05:24,380
Alright.

974
01:05:25,500 --> 01:05:26,600
It's okay, we're fine.

975
01:05:28,160 --> 01:05:28,640
We're fine.

976
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:30,960
Where is the etiquette?

977
01:05:31,160 --> 01:05:35,100
You're supposed to not touch somebody when they're doing the
cutscene.

978
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:43,540
No, it's like when you're in a cutscene, you don't interrupt
him.

979
01:05:44,360 --> 01:05:45,500
That's always the rule.

980
01:05:45,820 --> 01:05:46,520
I'm going to explode.

981
01:05:46,860 --> 01:05:47,540
I'm going to explode.

982
01:05:47,980 --> 01:05:48,340
Please.

983
01:05:48,520 --> 01:05:49,020
No!

984
01:05:49,660 --> 01:05:51,240
So close!

985
01:05:53,300 --> 01:05:53,840
Stop!

986
01:05:56,900 --> 01:05:57,440
Stop!

987
01:06:01,160 --> 01:06:02,640
This is not fair.

988
01:06:03,680 --> 01:06:04,980
This is not fair.

989
01:06:05,660 --> 01:06:07,440
This boss fight fucking sucks.

990
01:06:11,480 --> 01:06:13,600
I can't believe it.

991
01:06:14,120 --> 01:06:15,400
Why does it take so long?

992
01:06:15,520 --> 01:06:18,880
Batman, why don't you have better upper body strength?

993
01:06:20,360 --> 01:06:21,740
I don't understand.

994
01:06:25,500 --> 01:06:26,100
Why?

995
01:06:26,620 --> 01:06:28,820
Why are you not jacked enough?

996
01:06:30,840 --> 01:06:32,400
Okay, here we go.

997
01:06:32,860 --> 01:06:33,500
Jack Rider!

998
01:06:33,880 --> 01:06:34,760
Can you hear me?

999
01:06:34,980 --> 01:06:35,220
Okay.

1000
01:06:35,820 --> 01:06:36,940
Alright, there we go.

1001
01:06:37,220 --> 01:06:37,740
We got it!

1002
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:40,880
Here we go.

1003
01:06:41,140 --> 01:06:43,860
Batman, you could have made more antidotes!

1004
01:06:47,940 --> 01:06:48,880
Alright, nice.

1005
01:06:49,860 --> 01:06:50,820
Alright, one more.

1006
01:06:52,580 --> 01:06:54,080
We just need one more.

1007
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:56,360
And then we should be fine.

1008
01:06:58,240 --> 01:06:59,600
Can I just run away?

1009
01:07:00,420 --> 01:07:01,260
There's no way.

1010
01:07:01,460 --> 01:07:02,420
I understand now.

1011
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:03,660
Never dodge, bro.

1012
01:07:03,800 --> 01:07:04,320
Just run.

1013
01:07:07,100 --> 01:07:08,160
Alright, here we go.

1014
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:09,560
Here we go.

1015
01:07:09,880 --> 01:07:10,320
Last one.

1016
01:07:12,800 --> 01:07:13,600
Last one.

1017
01:07:14,560 --> 01:07:17,060
There's no way I can get distracted this time.

1018
01:07:18,300 --> 01:07:19,740
As long as I keep...

1019
01:07:19,740 --> 01:07:21,640
As long as I keep throwing my punch.

1020
01:07:22,160 --> 01:07:22,320
Ow.

1021
01:07:22,900 --> 01:07:23,440
Oh no.

1022
01:07:23,780 --> 01:07:24,900
Oh no, he has guns.

1023
01:07:25,420 --> 01:07:25,860
No!

1024
01:07:27,620 --> 01:07:29,740
Why are you letting them have guns now?

1025
01:07:29,780 --> 01:07:30,560
This is not fair!

1026
01:07:32,600 --> 01:07:33,820
This is not fair!

1027
01:07:35,500 --> 01:07:36,000
Okay.

1028
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:38,020
Alright, get rid of him.

1029
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:40,560
Oh, God.

1030
01:07:40,780 --> 01:07:40,940
Oh, God.

1031
01:07:41,020 --> 01:07:43,460
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1032
01:07:43,460 --> 01:07:44,060
Get the gun away.

1033
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:44,720
Get the gun away.

1034
01:07:44,940 --> 01:07:45,440
No guns.

1035
01:07:45,960 --> 01:07:46,880
No guns allowed.

1036
01:07:47,460 --> 01:07:48,160
Mele's only.

1037
01:07:50,040 --> 01:07:50,300
Okay.

1038
01:07:50,500 --> 01:07:51,580
I gotta get rid of him.

1039
01:07:53,880 --> 01:07:56,700
I don't like... I don't like the fucking...

1040
01:07:56,700 --> 01:07:59,380
Okay, I'm gonna hope the bombs will kill them for me.

1041
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:01,560
Okay.

1042
01:08:01,560 --> 01:08:02,360
God damn it.

1043
01:08:02,460 --> 01:08:03,140
There's so many.

1044
01:08:04,280 --> 01:08:04,520
Oh!

1045
01:08:04,780 --> 01:08:05,600
Who has the gun?

1046
01:08:06,140 --> 01:08:06,800
Who has the gun?

1047
01:08:06,900 --> 01:08:07,800
How did you get the gun?

1048
01:08:08,660 --> 01:08:09,200
Oh shit.

1049
01:08:09,720 --> 01:08:09,920
Oh shit.

1050
01:08:10,300 --> 01:08:10,300
Oh shit.

1051
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:10,600
Oh shit.

1052
01:08:10,840 --> 01:08:11,520
How do you get a gun?

1053
01:08:12,940 --> 01:08:14,120
Where did you get that?

1054
01:08:15,220 --> 01:08:15,520
Alright.

1055
01:08:15,820 --> 01:08:17,040
I gotta make sure.

1056
01:08:17,940 --> 01:08:18,120
Alright.

1057
01:08:19,020 --> 01:08:19,400
Trigger.

01:08:20,520 --> 01:08:21,060
Nice.

1059
01:08:21,900 --> 01:08:22,180
Okay.

1060
01:08:22,800 --> 01:08:23,080
Why?

1061
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:24,500
Dodge.

1062
01:08:26,120 --> 01:08:26,500
God.

1063
01:08:26,720 --> 01:08:27,140
No wonder.

1064
01:08:27,680 --> 01:08:30,020
No wonder everyone was like, this is the worst one.

1065
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:34,540
No wonder everyone's like, this is the worst boss.

1066
01:08:34,800 --> 01:08:36,220
But I agree.

1067
01:08:36,940 --> 01:08:37,880
I fucking agree.

1068
01:08:38,040 --> 01:08:38,640
This is the worst.

1069
01:08:38,660 --> 01:08:40,260
Worst boss fight.

1070
01:08:42,160 --> 01:08:43,360
Jesus Christ.

1071
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:47,980
Got that.

1072
01:08:48,980 --> 01:08:49,320
Then.

1073
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:50,420
Get closer.

1074
01:08:50,500 --> 01:08:50,920
Get closer.

1075
01:08:51,740 --> 01:08:51,800
No!

1076
01:08:51,940 --> 01:08:52,780
It's not close enough!

1077
01:08:54,620 --> 01:08:55,020
Please.

1078
01:08:55,820 --> 01:08:56,140
Jump.

1079
01:08:58,280 --> 01:08:58,580
Okay.

1080
01:08:59,280 --> 01:08:59,600
Thank God.

1081
01:08:59,760 --> 01:09:00,420
No, no, no!

1082
01:09:00,460 --> 01:09:00,780
Not the gun!

1083
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:01,120
Not the gun!

1084
01:09:02,100 --> 01:09:03,100
Not the gun!

1085
01:09:03,460 --> 01:09:03,660
Alright.

1086
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:06,320
Okay, we got rid of the gun.

1087
01:09:08,040 --> 01:09:08,640
Yes!

1088
01:09:08,660 --> 01:09:08,880
Yes!

1089
01:09:09,540 --> 01:09:10,000
No!

1090

1092
01:09:13,820 --> 01:09:13,920

01:09:22,360 --> 01:09:22,940
No!

1096
01:09:24,660 --> 01:09:26,140
Nobody died!

1097
01:09:27,200 --> 01:09:29,440
How did you live?

1098
01:09:30,040 --> 01:09:31,900
How did you live?

1099
01:09:34,040 --> 01:09:36,460
Who let you live?

1100
01:09:37,140 --> 01:09:38,300
Who let you live?

1101
01:09:38,800 --> 01:09:39,240
Okay.

1102
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:40,480
There we go.

1103
01:09:41,380 --> 01:09:41,980
We should be fine.

1104
01:09:41,980 --> 01:09:44,000
Please, please, do not get close to me.

1105
01:09:44,020 --> 01:09:44,540
Please.

1106
01:09:51,660 --> 01:09:53,380
Oh, my God.

1107
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:55,900
How do they keep coming back?

1108
01:09:56,640 --> 01:09:59,320
It's just, it's always the one guy.

1109
01:10:00,740 --> 01:10:03,740
Why is it always the one guy?

1110
01:10:04,920 --> 01:10:05,600
No, no.

1111
01:10:06,700 --> 01:10:08,400

Why is it always one guy?

1123
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:27,200
How is this possible?

1124
01:12:27,880 --> 01:12:31,100
How is it always one person that was alive?

1125
01:12:31,780 --> 01:12:32,560
How?

1126
01:12:33,260 --> 01:12:36,300

There's no fucking way!

01:12:40,060 --> 01:12:42,160
I'm actually so unlucky.

1129
01:12:43,100 --> 01:12:44,920
I've never been so unlucky before.

1130
01:12:47,380 --> 01:12:48,380
Oh my god.

1131
01:12:50,220 --> 01:12:53,780

1142
01:13:48,220 --> 01:13:51,120
This has nothing to do with luck.

1143
01:13:54,160 --> 01:13:56,540
I thought he was dead.

1144
01:13:59,820 --> 01:14:00,440

1186
01:15:48,100 --> 01:15:48,520
Oh, shit.

1187
01:15:48,640 --> 01:15:49,120
Not the guns.

1188
01:15:50,120 --> 01:15:50,960
Not the gun.

1189
01:15:54,040 --> 01:15:55,560
Okay, we gotta get rid of him.

1190
01:15:56,900 --> 01:15:58,320
And then punch him in the back.

1191
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:00,840
Okay, I'm gonna get hit at him.

1192
01:16:02,380 --> 01:16:02,740
Oh.

1193
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:07,460
God, there's still so many!

1194
01:16:07,840 --> 01:16:08,900
No, he's going for the gun!

1195
01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:09,880
Okay.

1196
01:16:09,900 --> 01:16:11,700
George, don't gun for you!

1197
01:16:11,780 --> 01:16:12,760
Is he okay?

1198
01:16:13,440 --> 01:16:15,420
As long as there's...

1199
01:16:15,420 --> 01:16:17,460
As long as like he doesn't get the gun, we're fine.

1200
01:16:19,820 --> 01:16:21,780
I just hope he... I just wanted him to not hold the gun.

1201
01:16:23,840 --> 01:16:23,860
Alright.

1202
01:16:25,880 --> 01:16:27,920
How many more are there?

1203
01:16:30,620 --> 01:16:31,020
Okay.

1204
01:16:31,160 --> 01:16:35,780
Last guy.

1205
01:16:37,340 --> 01:16:37,500
Alright.

1206
01:16:38,860 --> 01:16:39,260
Nice!

1207
01:16:39,900 --> 01:16:41,820
I told you I can learn.

1208
01:16:44,240 --> 01:16:45,940
I double tap for real.

1209
01:16:53,580 --> 01:16:54,740
I can take it.

1210
01:16:55,280 --> 01:16:57,400
I can take anything you throw at me, Bats.

1211
01:16:58,180 --> 01:16:58,980
I did it.

1212
01:16:59,760 --> 01:17:01,940
I'm actually going to win.

1213
01:17:02,860 --> 01:17:04,480
Ready for the next round?

1214
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:05,420
Always.

1215
01:17:05,720 --> 01:17:06,180
What?

1216
01:17:06,700 --> 01:17:09,000
I'll never let you win.

1217
01:17:10,100 --> 01:17:12,000
Maybe he just...

1218
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:12,720
Oh, shit.

1219
01:17:14,060 --> 01:17:15,140
Oh, fuck.

1220
01:17:21,620 --> 01:17:23,660
That's like a broken hand right there.

1221
01:17:23,760 --> 01:17:26,220
Like, he literally put explosives on his hand.

1222
01:17:26,440 --> 01:17:27,780
Like, what the fuck?

1223
01:17:28,640 --> 01:17:29,680
Holy fuck.

1224
01:17:37,500 --> 01:17:38,800
Yeah, sorry, Barbara.

1225
01:17:39,140 --> 01:17:40,760
I sort of...

1226
01:17:40,760 --> 01:17:42,620
He got electrocuted several times.

1227
01:17:43,140 --> 01:17:45,100
Because I kept getting one guide.

1228
01:17:46,020 --> 01:17:48,060
All super criminals are back in custody.

1229
01:17:49,900 --> 01:17:50,960
Quite a mess in there.

1230
01:17:51,740 --> 01:17:54,240
And the venom-enhanced inmates are returning to normal.

1231
01:17:55,020 --> 01:17:57,120
But what about the bones?

1232
01:18:02,500 --> 01:18:03,620
I'll survive.

1233
01:18:04,740 --> 01:18:05,440
See you tonight, Barbara.

1234
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:07,420
Shame about your car.

1235
01:18:07,560 --> 01:18:08,940
This is a break damage, Barbara.

1236
01:18:09,440 --> 01:18:09,780
Thanks, Jim.

1237
01:18:10,060 --> 01:18:11,220
But I have one on the way.

1238
01:18:11,660 --> 01:18:12,400
Get some rest.

1239
01:18:12,840 --> 01:18:14,820
You deserve it.

01:18:16,910 --> 01:18:18,150
Stay safe, Jim.

1241
01:18:18,230 --> 01:18:19,270
Two officers down.

1242
01:18:19,370 --> 01:18:21,390
The suspect is fleeing in their patrol car.

1243
01:18:30,820 --> 01:18:33,260
Yeah, his arm is his hand is definitely broken.

1244
01:18:33,860 --> 01:18:34,560
Holy fuck.

1245
01:18:37,760 --> 01:18:39,440
We did it!

1246
01:18:39,720 --> 01:18:41,300
We beat Batman!

1247
01:18:43,040 --> 01:18:43,460
Wait!

1248
01:18:43,860 --> 01:18:45,400
I could have beat this game!

1249
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:50,140
I could have beat this game two days ago in part three!

1250
01:18:50,860 --> 01:18:55,480
You guys were like, oh, it's gonna take her like two to
three more hours.

1251
01:18:55,680 --> 01:18:56,820
Like three more hours.

1252
01:18:57,160 --> 01:19:03,560
I could have literally played an hour and we could have just
beat the game two days ago.

1253
01:19:04,180 --> 01:19:05,680
I can't believe it.

1254
01:19:08,640 --> 01:19:17,800
I can't fucking believe it What do you mean it almost took
me two hours It took me an hour We had like 5-20 minutes of

1255
01:19:17,800 --> 01:19:19,380
Zaxx and Donning in the beginning

1256
01:19:22,780 --> 01:19:27,840

The remastered slash remake.

1263
01:19:59,840 --> 01:20:04,460
We're gonna do Resident Evil 4 for next week, our new
playthrough.

1264
01:20:04,860 --> 01:20:07,540
Oh my god, I wrote down like a shitload of games.

1265
01:20:08,260 --> 01:20:10,960
Is that the same fucking picture of Batman beating up a guy
again?

1266
01:20:11,420 --> 01:20:12,400
I swear, I just saw this.

1267
01:20:12,680 --> 01:20:14,260

1271
01:20:17,400 --> 01:20:21,420
Um, I was like, I was writing, like, a bunch of games and

01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:29,220
Okay, wait, let me... Okay, we don't care about the credits
anyway.

1275
01:20:30,560 --> 01:20:30,880
Let me,

1276
01:20:34,640 --> 01:20:35,720

1277
01:20:35,960 --> 01:20:38,080
Alright, I actually made a little games list too.

01:20:38,660 --> 01:20:40,700
Okay, there's like, let's see.

Ranch, Club Penguin, Digimon World, the Batman Telltale

1280
01:20:55,080 --> 01:20:55,620

Telltale series on like, do they have the Minecraft Telltale

1282
01:21:04,880 --> 01:21:06,020

1283
01:21:06,200 --> 01:21:09,160
Do they have it on the PlayStation, or is it an Xbox
exclusive?

1284
01:21:09,940 --> 01:21:11,240
Because then I need to buy an Xbox.

01:21:11,520 --> 01:21:13,480
I need to buy an Xbox.

1286
01:21:16,360 --> 01:21:23,000
Is the Minecraft Telltale Series only on Xbox?

1287
01:21:23,600 --> 01:21:25,220
Because you can't get it online anymore.

1288
01:21:25,380 --> 01:21:26,740

And then he dies.

1323
01:23:53,980 --> 01:23:56,800

01:24:17,560 --> 01:24:19,700
It turns into fucking pork.

Flight Simulator, Train Simulator, DuckTales Remastered,

1337
01:25:05,330 --> 01:25:05,950
Dead Rising.

1338
01:25:06,170 --> 01:25:08,150
Okay, I've always wanted to try out Dead Rising.

1339
01:25:08,270 --> 01:25:10,030
I think Dead Rising would be really fun.

1340
01:25:10,510 --> 01:25:19,010
Crash Bandicoot Trilogy and Racing, Tokyo Jungle, Sleeping
Dogs, the original Kingdom Hearts, Halo Infinite, or like

1341
01:25:19,010 --> 01:25:26,210
anything from Halo, Sunset Overdrive, and then I was
watching Shore 4 play like Supermarket Simulator, and then I

1342
01:25:26,210 --> 01:25:31,550
was like, you know what, I want to know what it's like to be
Minimum wage.

1343
01:25:35,510 --> 01:25:41,490
I was watching ShareForeplay Supermarket Simulator for like,
like I wasn't watching for seven hours.

1344
01:25:41,670 --> 01:25:43,810
I watched like the last two hours of it.

1345
01:25:44,190 --> 01:25:50,690
And it's like that type of game where like you just turn off
your brain and just like, turn off your brain and restock.

1346
01:25:52,830 --> 01:25:53,350

I'm glad you guys have been enjoying it.

1363
01:26:14,090 --> 01:26:21,570
Uh, but yeah, there's like, I've been like slowly writing
down all the games that I've wanted to play, uh, that I've

1364
01:26:21,570 --> 01:26:24,570
been wanting to play, like the past couple of years.

1365
01:26:24,910 --> 01:26:32,510
So, like, I'm, I'm like super excited to like, try, like,
eventually do everything on this this there's like oh my god

1366
01:26:32,510 --> 01:26:40,050
i love how like people were like when they saw the sonic
game that put for this week people were like oh my god she's

1367
01:26:40,050 --> 01:26:47,190
funny she's gonna be playing sonic and then they read which
type of sonic i'm gonna be playing and everyone was like oh

1368
01:26:47,190 --> 01:26:50,030
it's that sonic game

1369
01:26:53,850 --> 01:27:04,750
that's so funny people were like oh no the monkey paw is
like to play sonic it's sonic dreams collection

1370
01:27:07,810 --> 01:27:17,230
Pikachu thank you for the 50 gifted ships thank you thank
you I really appreciate it thank you so much um all you

1371
01:27:17,230 --> 01:27:29,170
zoomers and and uh gen a you guys were not you guys never
lived until you saw sonic dreams collection which is in my

1372
01:27:29,170 --> 01:27:32,330
opinion one of the Sonic games out there.

1373
01:27:32,410 --> 01:27:34,390
I've never played Sonic Dreams Collection before.

1374
01:27:34,950 --> 01:27:38,590
I remember when it first came out and I seen like a
playthrough of it.

1375
01:27:39,570 --> 01:27:44,930
And honestly, in my opinion, definitely one of the best
Sonic games out there.

1376
01:27:45,230 --> 01:27:49,890
Did you guys know that the creators of Sonic Dream
Collection went on to create Neon White?

1377
01:27:53,670 --> 01:28:01,810
I think that's actually crazy that the creator of Sonic
Dreams Collection neon white.

1378
01:28:02,390 --> 01:28:06,950
Like the jump between that to this was the origin story.

1379
01:28:07,170 --> 01:28:10,950
The origin story of the devs of neon white.

1380
01:28:11,590 --> 01:28:12,890
That's so that's insane.

1381
01:28:13,990 --> 01:28:20,010
And also Tattletal, Tattal, Tattal, like the indie horror
game, indie mascot horror game.

1382
01:28:21,870 --> 01:28:22,750

Thank you for being there and making me laugh for another
year while I get old.

1397
01:29:10,090 --> 01:29:10,950

Thank you.

1409
01:29:26,690 --> 01:29:28,530
It's one of the best Sonic games, in my opinion.

1410
01:29:28,810 --> 01:29:29,590
I never played it.

1411
01:29:29,810 --> 01:29:30,690
Never changed.

1412
01:29:31,910 --> 01:29:32,370
Shogi.

1413
01:29:32,370 --> 01:29:34,910
Thank you for the Magenta Supa.

1414
01:29:35,370 --> 01:29:36,690
Thank you, thank you.

1415
01:29:37,790 --> 01:29:39,290
It's no problem, guys.

1416
01:29:39,730 --> 01:29:43,510
I still think it's one of the best Sonic games out there.

1417
01:29:43,970 --> 01:29:45,510
That's why you know it's good.

1418
01:29:45,790 --> 01:29:48,790
I've never played it, but I think it's the best one.

1419
01:29:49,110 --> 01:29:51,030
That's when you know it's a really good Sonic game.

1420
01:29:51,110 --> 01:29:53,450
You don't have to play it to know it's peak Sonic.

1421
01:29:54,410 --> 01:29:56,290
Um, Nexie, thank you for the Akasupa.

1422
01:29:56,550 --> 01:29:56,790

01:29:57,810 --> 01:30:00,690
Super excited for you and all the fun games you have
planned.

Thank you guys Yeah This was a very short stream.

1430
01:30:10,710 --> 01:30:13,850
Um, I legitimately thought it would be a lot longer.

1431
01:30:13,990 --> 01:30:24,850
I mean to be fair Uh, to be fair like I did I feel like I
was going my PC was going through a lot like the last like

1432
01:30:24,850 --> 01:30:26,610
uh two days ago It's going through a lot.

1433
01:30:26,630 --> 01:30:32,290
I was on fucking wi-fi and like My crashes was insane.

1434
01:30:33,230 --> 01:30:35,930

We powered through.

1437
01:30:41,210 --> 01:30:43,550
Guys, I swear it's not a PC.

1438
01:30:43,890 --> 01:30:46,750
Okay, maybe it's a little bit of a PC issue, okay?

1439
01:30:47,030 --> 01:30:53,170
But, like, I swear, guys, it's not just my PC, though.

1440
01:30:53,470 --> 01:30:55,230
It can't just be my PC.

1441
01:30:55,590 --> 01:30:59,390
There was more at stake with the game.
