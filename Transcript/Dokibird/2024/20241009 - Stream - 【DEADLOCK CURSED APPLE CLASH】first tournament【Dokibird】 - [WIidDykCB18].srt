1
00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:03,990
All right, have a nice pee.

2
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:09,950
All right, I have no idea.

3
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:21,150
Guys, if we... if we can get knocked out early, then we don't have... okay, I shouldn't say that.

4
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:28,230
Then we don't have to do day two.

5
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:34,930
And then all I'm saying is, one guy has to survive a hurricane, so...

6
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:43,350
One guy has to survive a hurricane, so...

7
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:46,710
Which guy has to survive a hurricane?

8
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:50,890
Okay, Raditz.

9
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:59,530
So, I don't know my sound guys in chat, but like, I don't have my... I don't have my...

10
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:00,930
I forgot to save my deadlock.

11
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:02,470
Deadlock sound settings.

12
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:03,210
Do you see what's happening?

13
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:03,790
What?

14
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:04,550
What's happening?

15
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:05,630
What's happening?

16
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:06,690
What?

17
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:09,370
I'm going in and out of Ramblin.

18
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:10,750
Oh, I don't see that.

19
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:12,950
That's good.

20
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:13,270
That's good.

21
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:14,050
Hello.

22
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:15,550
That's a good sign.

23
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:16,010
Why is that good?

24
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:17,170
Oh.

25
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:19,250
Okay.

26
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:22,030
The aura.

27
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:23,050
Okay.

28
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:24,070
The aura.

29
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:25,270
Disqualified.

30
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:29,510
Oh my gosh, I don't even know what I'm supposed to...

31
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:30,390
Okay.

32
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:32,170
Three, two, three, two, one.

33
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:32,370
Okay.

34
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:33,110
Three, two, one, four.

35
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:33,430
Okay.

36
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:37,150
It's been a while since I've played A's!

37
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:43,520
We don't even have an Abrams on our team because they took Abrams from us.

38
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:45,570
I know.

39
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:54,180
Where the fuck...

40
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:55,180
Wait, where is Sage at?

41
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,300
He's not even in the voice.

42
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,140
I'm not sure.

43
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,400
Wait, is he like, there for real?

44
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:00,740
He's there.

45
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:01,600
Oh, okay.

46
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,560
I was gonna say, I'll be...

47
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:03,720
Wait.

48
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:07,920
Oh, what the fuck?

49
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,820
Okay, this must be EU favorite.

50
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:10,440
There's no way.

51
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

52
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:11,520
Hunter King.

53
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:12,580
Hunter King.

54
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:13,560
Oh, okay.

55
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:14,440
It is King.

56
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,280
Yeah, because I was like, what the fuck?

57
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:18,240
How are they hitting that before me?

58
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,600
They're denying it really well.

59
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:23,620
All right, are these people EU?

60
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,780
Um, half of them are.

61
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:27,400
No, I know like the main...

62
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,860
The captain is, but I know like some of them are NA.

63
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:32,240
Oh my god.

64
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:32,940
Oh my god.

65
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:34,960
Wait, this feels kind of impossible.

66
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:37,400
We're on EU ping, bro.

67
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:38,600
Yeah, we sure are.

68
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:39,300
Yeah.

69
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,840
I shot one bullet and I was like, that's not East Coast.

70
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:45,740
Okay.

71
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,180
That's fine.

72
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,680
We just use that as an excuse.

73
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:54,000
Yeah, yeah, that's our excuse.

74
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,220
Yeah, if we lose, that's because of our ping, right guys?

75
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:57,160
Yeah.

76
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:00,840
I'm just shooting in the general direction, hoping for the best.

77
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:02,800
I'll stride through my enemies.

78
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:03,280
I feel that.

79
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:08,900
I hope you're farming for me because... yeah.

80
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:11,960
I'm trying, I'm trying.

81
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:15,000
Ray's a professional farmer.

82
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:16,460
Yeah, I hope you're farming.

83
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,180
I'm not... I'm not doing so hot, just saying.

84
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:22,560
We're getting them low.

85
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:23,180
We're getting them low.

86
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:27,580
Yeah, you just gotta fry them, Ray.

87
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,120
Bro, fuck you and your EU, like...

88
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:34,560
I mean, I got him low, I got him...

89
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,860
Oh my god, he's so low, he's so low.

90
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:36,360
I have to reload.

91
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:38,980
He's actually one.

92
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:40,020
I actually got him one.

93
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:41,900
Yeah, literally one crack.

94
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,120
He's got no swap.

95
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:48,560
I don't think I've secured a single one.

96
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,700
I secured one from their side.

97
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:53,420
Oh, nice, nice.

98
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:53,860
That's good.

99
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,780
Oh my god, he parried me.

100
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:58,980
How did he parry me in this...

101
00:03:58,980 --> 00:03:59,280
Oh, never mind.

102
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,800
How did he parry me?

103
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:03,380
Oh, the kelvin's still there.

104
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:09,010
I can go bye-bye.

105
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:09,910
I'm gonna buy, actually.

106
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:10,990
Are you gonna be okay?

107
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:14,350
I hope you're gonna be okay, because I'm not looking at you.

108
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:18,470
That's a good teammate right there.

109
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:20,090
You just... you set him up for success.

110
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:21,130
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

111
00:04:21,330 --> 00:04:21,910
I just left.

112
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:24,110
I'm not gonna look, so whatever happens...

113
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:26,610
Yeah, I was gonna say, like...

114
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:30,370
All right.

115
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:34,670
Oh, okay, there you go.

116
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:36,470
I fucking finally denied them something.

117
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:42,730
Forgot what little ammo he has, too.

118
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:46,010
Oh, fuck.

119
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,920
Oh, you're so low.

120
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,940
Yeah, I'm gonna come back here.

121
00:04:58,780 --> 00:04:59,620
I'll be back.

122
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:00,060
I'll be back.

123
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:00,860
Fuck, okay.

124
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:01,820
No!

125
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:03,420
No!

126
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:04,740
Why did you die?

127
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:05,440
Okay.

128
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,440
You went all the way back?

129
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,820
I'm so low.

130
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:17,820
For the moment you left, they fucking pushed.

131
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:22,800
They actually pushed the moment you fucking left.

132
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,920
You know what would be really funny?

133
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:29,940
Is if they're not EU.

134
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:32,740
Well, the captain is EU, so...

135
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:36,360
Yeah, I was gonna say, what if they're NA, and they're also playing on this one?

136
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,040
What the hell?

137
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:38,520
Why are we fighting an EU team?

138
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,640
They're like, these guys are lagging.

139
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,520
What part of...

140
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,020
Oh my god.

141
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:47,100
It was just, oh my god, I fucking unlocked the wrong thing.

142
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,260
It's a mess right now.

143
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,240
I'm too squishy.

144
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:54,620
Okay, I need you to tell me when I need to start farming, because I don't know.

145
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:56,480
Gotcha.

146
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,440
Seven minutes.

147
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,340
Seven minutes to camp spawn.

148
00:05:59,460 --> 00:05:59,620
Yeah.

149
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:05,360
You want to get a bunch of 500 items, and then once you get Tesla bullets, that's when you can farm.

150
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:07,060
Okay.

151
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:08,620
Thank god I'm not solo laning.

152
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:09,780
Holy shit.

153
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,140
I'd be so sad.

154
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,040
Solo laning in this thing against Magenna is, you know...

155
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,300
Thank god that's not me.

156
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:18,300
That's all I'm saying.

157
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:21,160
Yeah, Abrams has got to be worse.

158
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:21,840
I feel bad for him.

159
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,360
I'm trying to press the parry button.

160
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:25,460
I just, I just can't.

161
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,280
It's like Street Fighter.

162
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:26,980
You gotta guess, right?

163
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:28,400
I'm just guessing.

164
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,280
Who's my tether?

165
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:30,520
I tethered one.

166
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:31,520
The one I casted.

167
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,400
Oh, I got ulted.

168
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:32,840
Goodbye.

169
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:35,000
I'm gonna watch you.

170
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,560
Pocket ultied me?

171
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,060
Oh, I'm trying to help you.

172
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:42,940
I'm assisting.

173
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:43,600
I'm assisting.

174
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:46,640
I somehow survived two ultimates.

175
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:49,160
Yep, I don't know how, but you're gaming.

176
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:51,260
Honestly, you're a gamer.

177
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:54,240
Wait, what the fuck is he doing over there?

178
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:55,540
Good luck gaming.

179
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,320
I'm really low.

180
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:57,240
I think we should just group back.

181
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:57,920
We have our zipline.

182
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:58,380
Yeah.

183
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,700
All right.

184
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,340
I've hidden successfully.

185
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:06,600
I've always known you can.

186
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,100
Do you have your boosting tin?

187
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,160
You're talking to me?

188
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:13,740
What the fuck is...

189
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:15,060
Oh, oh, okay.

190
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,420
The lane booster.

191
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:16,900
I was like...

192
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,760
You hit her with the boosting tin and broke the brain.

193
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:20,420
That was bad.

194
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:25,040
I mean, if you just said boosting, it would've been fine.

195
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,680
We added the extra words in there.

196
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:37,540
I think I may be in the statistical worst matchup.

197
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,060
You could've swapped.

198
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:41,440
Oh my god, I'm just getting obliterated.

199
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:41,580
Get down.

200
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:43,300
You could've swapped me.

201
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:46,020
My ping paradox against low ping Abrams.

202
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:55,740
Don't worry, my laner was sitting in the bush void, sitting with like five turrets.

203
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:56,840
And I was like, all right, well.

204
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:59,860
It is what it is, you know?

205
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:04,000
Actually, I think this isn't the worst matchup.

206
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:08,540
Yeah, I mean, this is like Shove's worst matchup, but I think...

207
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:08,900
I'm telling you.

208
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:09,400
You got your ultimate?

209
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:10,520
Yeah, I do.

210
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:12,620
All right, I'm gonna push.

211
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,200
No, Ramblin!

212
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:15,180
I'll get the one.

213
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,440
No, wait, what's happening?

214
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,080
What happened to you?

215
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,840
I thought their ultimate wasn't up again, but it was.

216
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:24,920
Oh my god.

217
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:27,500
I slept in though.

218
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,960
I was like, what?

219
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:29,700
I got him!

220
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:30,160
I got him!

221
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:30,760
I got him!

222
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:32,740
Nice, okay.

223
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:34,680
It's fine.

224
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,940
I just saw you insta-die.

225
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:39,060
Yeah, I got stunned.

226
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:46,320
Don't worry, we'll get our ultimate soon enough.

227
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,160
I was just like, why the fuck you just disappeared?

228
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,040
Okay, are you back?

229
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:56,360
Yeah, I'm back.

230
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:56,920
All right.

231
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:02,460
It's fine, we got our one fucking kill.

232
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:03,740
That's all that matters.

233
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,740
Oh hey, the farm's up.

234
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:07,660
It's time.

235
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:08,360
Goodbye.

236
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,460
It is time.

237
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,860
I believe in you.

238
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,660
I don't know how I'm going to...

239
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:15,340
Holy shit.

240
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:17,640
Wait, what the fuck?

241
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,940
How did it get worse?

242
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:19,540
The lag.

243
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,180
Oh no.

244
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,020
They're close by the way, so they might jump on you.

245
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:24,600
I know.

246
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:26,620
You know, the lag actually got worse.

247
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:27,040
How?

248
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,040
My lag was my... it was fine earlier until now.

249
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,180
Let me know if they push me.

250
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:36,420
I don't know, you want to look for something here?

251
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,200
Uh, sure.

252
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,800
I'm gonna have you guys stay on this side.

253
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,020
I'm also down to come.

254
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:45,420
Avery might be heading towards...

255
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:46,520
Our tower's going down in a second.

256
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,440
You have a good eye.

257
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,840
It's Jover for him.

258
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,120
I'm here to fight blue.

259
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:54,860
I tethered pocket.

260
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:55,900
Okay, I'm coming back.

261
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:56,400
No!

262
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:02,580
You were supposed to be the chosen one!

263
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,440
I got one.

264
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,400
I'm just getting refilted on cooldown.

265
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,160
Oh, pocket's still here.

266
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:13,280
Oh god.

267
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,080
On me, on me.

268
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:15,320
Holy shit.

269
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:16,220
I'm on my way.

270
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:16,920
Oh no.

271
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,420
I didn't know, I didn't know.

272
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,160
Oh god.

273
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,060
Life isn't beautiful after all!

274
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:26,920
No.

275
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,620
I'm coming back, I'm coming back.

276
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:31,620
Everybody go Zippington.

277
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:33,940
Oh actually, wait, I'm gonna farm this real fast.

278
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:36,640
Yeah, Abrams is gonna be in our jungle.

279
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:38,700
I'm coming.

280
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:41,100
What the fuck?

281
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:41,940
Abrams, Abrams.

282
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,380
Oh my god, there's an Abrams here!

283
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:57,680
Alright guys, hey, um, I got Abrams.

284
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:00,860
I tethered him, I tethered him.

285
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,400
There's three in our green jungle, so...

286
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:04,520
Okay.

287
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,520
Guys, I wish...

288
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,460
I'm getting ultied!

289
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:14,100
Okay, I need to know who the fuck lag-switched the server.

290
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:14,860
Behind us?

291
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:15,700
Yeah.

292
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:16,940
Or...

293
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:21,900
Oh my god.

294
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,360
No, I don't.

295
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,980
I don't, I really don't.

296
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,000
He's so low that...

297
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,040
Oh, he's coming back.

298
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:34,800
Fucking, I'm trying!

299
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:38,500
Oh, who got ultied there?

300
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:39,320
Don't die.

301
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:39,820
Who hooked me?

302
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:43,500
If I can rotate to a green...

303
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:46,120
Yeah, they used Kalvindome.

304
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:46,840
Yeah.

305
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:49,360
I'm just getting giga-locked down!

306
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:51,600
Wait, you wanna swap with me, Gummi?

307
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:53,320
I can go yellow and hold if you wanna hold this walker.

308
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:55,980
Uh, sure, I can do that.

309
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:57,200
I got a Void.

310
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:00,520
There's a Kalvind here!

311
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,900
There's a Kalvind.

312
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:06,880
Oh, that's cool.

313
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,100
I got the swap.

314
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,840
I'm coming, I'm coming green!

315
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,780
Oh, nice shot!

316
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:16,560
Nice.

317
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:17,600
Where are you, Gummi?

318
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:19,320
Yeah.

319
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,560
Oh, that roll was...

320
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:22,820
Oh, don't die!

321
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:24,180
The fucking...

322
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:24,600
Die!

323
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,880
I don't think they're feeding, people.

324
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,800
Oh, they got it!

325
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,080
I don't think they're here, though.

326
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,300
I'm gonna try and get something to farm.

327
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,520
I need to farm so bad.

328
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:38,460
Okay, maybe we can take this tower, question mark?

329
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,620
I'll be right back, guys.

330
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:41,200
I'm farming.

331
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:51,420
The Abrams is purple and I don't think anybody else is killing it, probably, unless they send, like, four.

332
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,300
Oh my god.

333
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:57,080
I'm having a...

334
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:00,140
This game looks so weird when you're lagging, I never realized.

335
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:01,080
Nice.

336
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:01,720
She ulted.

337
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:03,560
I have barrier for you.

338
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:04,440
Okay, I'm coming back.

339
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,120
Yeah, I can tank.

340
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:05,900
I can tank her.

341
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,160
Oh, it was red, but it's okay.

342
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:12,640
Oh, there's someone on you!

343
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:15,380
Who's you?

344
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:16,400
Who's you?

345
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:17,920
You need to be...

346
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,580
I am you, I'm you.

347
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:21,600
You need to be very specific.

348
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:24,480
I'm coming, guys.

349
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:27,580
Yeah, I'm going for this.

350
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,620
I see dynamite.

351
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,220
I'm not late.

352
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,580
We're not on, uh, purple.

353
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,180
Where did I go?

354
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:38,060
I'm just a little guy.

355
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:42,140
Pockets by me.

356
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,680
They might come down here with me.

357
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:45,380
I'm heading over.

358
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:46,620
Oh, are we coming to blue?

359
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:48,620
Yeah, they wasted wraith ult on me.

360
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:49,680
They're downstairs with me.

361
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,200
I'm heading over.

362
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:52,480
I'm coming.

363
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:53,800
I'm coming.

364
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,440
I'm pocking them up.

365
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,200
There's three in here.

366
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:57,180
We're here.

367
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:57,640
We're here.

368
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:58,000
We're here.

369
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,400
There's four, I think.

370
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:00,460
I can't tell.

371
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,520
There seems to be a lot of people.

372
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,420
Don't go in.

373
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:03,960
There's a dynamo.

374
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:04,360
He's waiting.

375
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:05,300
They're half.

376
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:05,760
They're all half.

377
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,340
They're healing now.

378
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:06,780
Okay.

379
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:10,380
Oh, okay.

380
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:12,280
I'm like...

381
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,380
Oh my god.

382
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:14,300
There's a dynamo.

383
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:14,760
Okay.

384
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,580
Oh my god.

385
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,000
The fucking sound.

386
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:24,840
I'm dead.

387
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,140
I believe in you guys.

388
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,820
Okay, I stopped believing.

389
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:28,740
Oh, I got that.

390
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:32,140
We got Abrams, though.

391
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,280
That's a big chunk of money.

392
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,000
There were so many people there.

393
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:36,760
That was a moral victory.

394
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:39,380
It's okay.

395
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:40,600
It's okay.

396
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:40,900
I'll get your land.

397
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,840
Yeah, I don't want to deal with that.

398
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:43,680
We blame ping.

399
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:44,480
We blame...

400
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,600
Just be like...

401
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,560
Three blue, four blue, four blue, ping a walker.

402
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:50,200
Just a heads up for everyone.

403
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:52,220
Bravoss.

404
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:52,460
I'm coming.

405
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:52,780
I'm coming blue.

406
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:53,520
I'm coming blue.

407
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,540
Coming back to blue as well.

408
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:59,580
I think I can tether one.

409
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:00,640
I tethered pocket.

410
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,600
Oh, I might try to get a swap.

411
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,540
It's not your fault, ping.

412
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:10,660
They're rotating out.

413
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:11,320
Might go green.

414
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,040
Blame the ping.

415
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:12,740
Blame the ping.

416
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:13,400
Just remember.

417
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:14,620
It's not us.

418
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:15,300
It's the game.

419
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,040
I'm going purple.

420
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:20,440
Abrams is going green.

421
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:22,320
I'll come from the beginning.

422
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:24,040
Abrams going there too.

423
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:26,140
Whoa.

424
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,880
I might just fucking wait until I get...

425
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:29,680
Oh, I'm a cube.

426
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,200
What the fuck is going on?

427
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:35,760
Abrams here.

428
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:36,580
Abrams is here.

429
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:38,760
Good fight.

430
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:39,180
Good fight.

431
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:39,560
Keep going.

432
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:40,220
There's only one left.

433
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:40,620
Get him.

434
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:40,900
Get him.

435
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:41,160
Get him.

436
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:41,760
Get him.

437
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:42,080
Get him.

438
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:42,340
Get him.

439
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:42,740
Oh, pocket.

440
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:43,780
We're in Z.

441
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:44,340
I see him.

442
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:46,900
Oh my god.

443
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,240
He's fucking running like a little bitch.

444
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:49,520
I know.

445
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:49,940
We're okay.

446
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:51,980
Fuck your shit.

447
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:58,200
Oh my god.

448
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:03,720
I've played EU servers, but I've never had this lag before.

449
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:04,660
So it's so weird.

450
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:06,740
Oh my god, guys.

451
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:09,360
Where does she come from?

452
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:16,460
Okay.

453
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,260
Oh, I can get this now.

454
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:19,240
What is it?

455
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,320
What's my next one?

456
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,000
Five.

457
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:22,400
One.

458
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:23,700
There's three here.

459
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:24,000
One.

460
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:25,500
I'm trying to get a swap green.

461
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,400
Oh, turn around.

462
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:29,820
Don't worry.

463
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,480
I distracted them with my feet.

464
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:33,680
Love that.

465
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:34,560
Keep doing that.

466
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:35,660
I believe.

467
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:36,680
Distracting them with your feet.

468
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:42,020
First Jerry, then Vindicta, huh?

469
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,080
All right.

470
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:50,220
How is he chasing you?

471
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:52,180
There's an Abram here.

472
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:53,700
Yeah.

473
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:58,680
Are you okay over there?

474
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:01,540
I like to believe I'm okay.

475
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,540
Oh, all right.

476
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,640
I'm still...

477
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,700
I'm watching this.

478
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:09,880
I'm gonna clear yellow, and then I can come over.

479
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:11,500
I wish I could farm.

480
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:14,940
You can go farm purple side, maybe.

481
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:19,620
Are you guys okay if I leave you guys to farm?

482
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:21,140
Are you guys okay with that?

483
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:23,300
I haven't...

484
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:26,040
I've been getting cyberbullied so I couldn't farm.

485
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:31,160
Nice.

486
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,180
Three more here.

487
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:34,320
We have two executes, but I think we can handle Abram.

488
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:35,600
That's good.

489
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,080
Oh my gosh.

490
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,320
Maybe this is too strong for me.

491
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:39,160
No, we're fine.

492
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,560
Yellow's shoved also, by the way.

493
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,480
If they stay here, we might be good.

494
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,180
Wait, you guys want to fight?

495
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:46,020
Will you guys be okay?

496
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:46,660
Down.

497
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:48,360
Moving up.

498
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:49,520
I'm coming.

499
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:50,340
Oh, Abram's right.

500
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:52,340
Oh, Dynamo has ult, though.

501
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,680
One of them's in the mid-boss.

502
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:57,220
Top mid-boss.

503
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:57,820
Top mid-boss.

504
00:17:58,140 --> 00:17:58,840
Yeah, we should...

505
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,040
I'm swapping one.

506
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:02,900
I don't think we need to fight.

507
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:04,440
I'm going to go blue.

508
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,140
Maybe I'll go blue with you going to the tower.

509
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:11,200
Yeah.

510
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:13,120
Also, the buffs are up.

511
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:17,820
Say less!

512
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:19,120
Oh, Wraith's next to me.

513
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:19,760
Two green.

514
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,320
You okay, boy?

515
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:23,380
I'm good.

516
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,600
I'm tempted to just fucking farm for Ricochet right now.

517
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:29,540
Do it, do it, do it.

518
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,140
Oh, there's a big squad pulling up on us.

519
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:31,920
Yeah, I'm gonna do it.

520
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I'm gonna fucking farm just for Ricochet.

521
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,460
Wait, TP'd out?

522
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:38,740
No.

523
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:40,820
Oh, you should get Tesla bullet first, though.

524
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,940
Makes the farming juicier.

525
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,080
How much is Tesla bullets?

526
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:49,740
3,000.

527
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:50,480
3,000?

528
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,420
Okay, I'm gonna go for Ricochet first, because...

529
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:52,820
Oh, you should.

530
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,280
You should go with that purple wave.

531
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:55,660
Just because...

532
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,860
Actually, what?

533
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,360
Go to the purple.

534
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:00,940
Go purple.

535
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:02,180
Go purple instead of the jungle.

536
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,880
Well, actually, let me explain it in a better...

537
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:06,360
Oh, I'm dead.

538
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:09,740
I was too busy.

539
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:11,420
I was too busy looking up on that.

540
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:17,340
There's an Abrams coming over.

541
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:19,820
The minions in the lane are worth more than the jungle camp.

542
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,060
The minions are worth more than the jungle camp.

543
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:23,780
You should always try to get the minions in the lane.

544
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,720
I'm trying to swap in the Guinness if I can.

545
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:26,260
I have...

546
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:28,320
I'm so close to getting a...

547
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,080
Getting Ricochet.

548
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,360
Yeah, also, you don't want the building to die.

549
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,940
I think they just want to save the tower very desperately.

550
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:43,710
Can someone save our blue guardian?

551
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:45,450
Yeah, I'm good.

552
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:46,530
Okay.

553
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:48,330
And then, when I'm up, I'll come green.

554
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:50,470
I'm so close to it.

555
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:51,830
They might send it on purple.

556
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:52,770
Oh, yeah.

557
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:53,530
No, no, no, no, no.

558
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:54,030
There's a...

559
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:55,110
There's three.

560
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:56,170
There's three people on me.

561
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:57,930
There's an Abraham all the way back here.

562
00:19:58,050 --> 00:19:58,950
Oh, my god.

563
00:19:59,210 --> 00:19:59,670
Abraham.

564
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:00,930
That was unintentional!

565
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:01,930
Swapping him back.

566
00:20:01,930 --> 00:20:02,510
I'm so mad.

567
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:05,350
Run!

568
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:06,690
Run!

569
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:09,830
He wasn't even doing that intentionally.

570
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:10,770
Oh, no.

571
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:11,190
Pocket top.

572
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:14,250
What the fuck?

573
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:18,370
Holy shit.

574
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:22,750
That's actually so unlucky.

575
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:26,090
How did I lose my money?

576
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:26,570
What?

577
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:27,970
Oh, yeah.

578
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:31,390
You lose your farm from jungle camps if you die without spending it.

579
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:31,970
There's three on me.

580
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:32,350
I can pull.

581
00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:33,410
Really?

582
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:34,350
I'm on my way.

583
00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:36,110
How did you know that?

584
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:37,370
I used Wraith ult.

585
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:38,110
I'm good.

586
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:39,390
I'm coming blue.

587
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:40,330
Are we able to fight this or no?

588
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:41,910
After I heal, I'm going to get Wraith ulted.

589
00:20:41,930 --> 00:20:42,430
They're backing up.

590
00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:43,150
They're backing up.

591
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:47,090
Oh, my god.

592
00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:48,610
That's so unlucky for me.

593
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:50,590
I literally lost all my farm from jungle.

594
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:53,330
Abrams is tethered, but...

595
00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:53,570
I'm here.

596
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:54,250
I'm on Abrams.

597
00:20:54,810 --> 00:20:56,870
I'm going to grab Tesla now since I have it.

598
00:20:58,510 --> 00:21:00,030
Wraith exited green side.

599
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:05,090
It's not in my thing.

600
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:05,830
Tesla.

601
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:08,390
Tesla bullets are here.

602
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:11,770
I can't believe it.

603
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:13,210
Ugh, that farm I did.

604
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:16,030
Oh, Abrams on me.

605
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:16,070
I'm coming.

606
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:21,750
That's like the most unlucky thing that happened to me.

607
00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:24,570
No, I'm dumped out.

608
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:27,690
There's a pocket behind also.

609
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:29,590
I'm on the pocket.

610
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:32,730
Oh, I got ulted out.

611
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:34,110
That's unlucky.

612
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:36,670
Plumbing Abrams away.

613
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:38,950
I'm dead to pocket here.

614
00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:44,510
Do you need help?

615
00:21:44,690 --> 00:21:45,190
Do you need...

616
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:45,390
I know.

617
00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:46,430
I'm Wraith ulted.

618
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:50,490
Magical Leap these nuts.

619
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:52,150
You sicko.

620
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:53,150
I'm heading over.

621
00:21:53,330 --> 00:21:54,850
Buck is going under towards mid.

622
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:55,750
I see him.

623
00:21:55,850 --> 00:21:56,330
He's over here.

624
00:21:56,430 --> 00:21:57,350
I don't want to be here.

625
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:58,630
Oh, I don't want to be here either.

626
00:21:58,830 --> 00:21:59,990
Oh my god.

627
00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:01,310
What the fuck?

628
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:02,030
Okay, goodbye.

629
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:06,890
Someone just hit my head.

630
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:08,870
Oh my god, I'm yellow.

631
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:10,350
There's like four on Ramblin.

632
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:12,490
Oh my god, please.

633
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:12,950
I'm leaving.

634
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:14,090
I farmed some stuff.

635
00:22:14,170 --> 00:22:14,750
I need to go.

636
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:15,130
I...

637
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:19,470
I'm so scared of losing my farm after that one time.

638
00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:21,510
Play it safe.

639
00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:24,410
I guess...

640
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:26,950
They're trying to get the green walker.

641
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:28,710
Oh, they are?

642
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:29,270
Okay.

643
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:30,690
I'm heading over.

644
00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:32,890
Holy shit.

645
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:33,290
Okay.

646
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:34,390
This is tethered.

647
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:35,230
Mechanics is low.

648
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:36,170
Heading over.

649
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:37,190
There's like two behind us.

650
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:37,850
Wait, we can...

651
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:38,730
We can kill this.

652
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:40,050
Oh my god.

653
00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:41,190
I'm here.

654
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:43,490
Oh, she has so much healing in this pit.

655
00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:43,550
Oh my...

656
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:44,870
Oh my...

657
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:46,890
Oh no.

658
00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:51,790
You don't sound very happy right now.

659
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:56,350
Nah, that walker is just dead, I think, sadly.

660
00:22:57,630 --> 00:22:58,210
I'm here on Abrams.

661
00:22:59,290 --> 00:23:00,130
Swapping him back.

662
00:23:01,010 --> 00:23:02,990
Oh, there's a wraith behind you.

663
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:04,390
Oh, I couldn't...

664
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:04,970
I didn't get the sleep.

665
00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:07,610
Oh, he ulted, you guys.

666
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:08,730
Yeah.

667
00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:14,890
Anima's one.

668
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:15,870
Nice.

669
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:24,760
Oh, I got...

670
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:25,020
It's okay.

671
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:25,640
Like, I got hooked.

672
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:26,480
I got hooked.

673
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:28,760
I'm okay.

674
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:33,620
Weak minds can never catch me.

675
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,920
Guys, life isn't beautiful after all.

676
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,640
Holy shit, he heals.

677
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:41,480
I mean...

678
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:43,520
We really need a flex.

679
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:44,380
Oh, wait.

680
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:45,960
Oh my goodness.

681
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,440
Surely, it's killable.

682
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:47,880
Okay.

683
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,900
I always believed in you, Gumi.

684
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:53,460
Wait, maybe life is beautiful.

685
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:54,840
I really need to go.

686
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:57,120
Maybe we can turn this around right here, right now.

687
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:00,200
I'm gonna turn my monitor on.

688
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:01,700
I've been playing with my monitor off.

689
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:03,160
Glasses are on.

690
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:05,560
I'm moving to EU so I can play with this ping.

691
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,220
I'm applying for citizenship.

692
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,940
I'm applying for citizenship.

693
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:13,340
I'm applying for asylum so I can...

694
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:15,400
I'm applying for asylum right now.

695
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,560
Right, this is coming over to you guys.

696
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:22,020
She's invading.

697
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:22,380
She's invading.

698
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:25,080
I'm afflicted.

699
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,160
Oh, I'm dying in the altar.

700
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,760
Oh shit, do you guys need help?

701
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,040
I fucking left second.

702
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:31,860
They spent like three alts, four alts.

703
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:34,080
I don't think there's any help in that one.

704
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:35,060
They spent four alts.

705
00:24:38,650 --> 00:24:40,050
Oh my god, I'm almost...

706
00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:44,530
Guys, I really need like just a tiny bit more farm and then I can have Ricochet.

707
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:46,150
I am so close.

708
00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:49,870
I really need like four alts.

709
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:50,310
Please.

710
00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:51,930
They're still chasing you, Ramblin.

711
00:24:52,530 --> 00:24:54,010
Please, where is the four?

712
00:24:58,170 --> 00:24:58,690
Here.

713
00:24:58,890 --> 00:24:59,670
Ramblin's Cuber.

714
00:25:01,290 --> 00:25:02,990
There's an Abrams right there.

715
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:03,690
Are you okay?

716
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:06,910
Ramblin has been vibing.

717
00:25:07,390 --> 00:25:08,110
Kelvin's one.

718
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:08,730
I'm cubing.

719
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:09,590
Okay.

720
00:25:10,090 --> 00:25:11,470
All right guys, I'm leaving.

721
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:12,790
I'm leaving because I need...

722
00:25:12,790 --> 00:25:14,350
There's that one last farm right there.

723
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:16,930
There's that one last farm right there.

724
00:25:16,930 --> 00:25:17,630
It's awesome.

725
00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:19,370
It's literally right there.

726
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:20,370
I need four.

727
00:25:21,210 --> 00:25:22,230
Can we contest or not?

728
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:22,450
I'll try.

729
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:23,430
Ramblin has nothing as well.

730
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:24,410
I'm also gonna try to steal.

731
00:25:24,410 --> 00:25:25,110
Doki has altski.

732
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:25,970
If Doki comes out.

733
00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:26,530
Yeah, I'm coming.

734
00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:26,910
I can.

735
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:27,210
I can come.

736
00:25:27,210 --> 00:25:27,970
I'm going for it.

737
00:25:28,170 --> 00:25:29,650
I'll try to sneak Doki and then...

738
00:25:29,650 --> 00:25:29,790
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

739
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:31,010
I have no...

740
00:25:31,010 --> 00:25:31,730
They have no dynamo.

741
00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:32,610
I can go in first.

742
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:34,890
I am very far, so give me a sec.

743
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:35,690
I'm walled out.

744
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:37,110
Fuck, I was just too early.

745
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:37,730
I'm so close.

746
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:38,590
Meme on my way.

747
00:25:39,050 --> 00:25:40,710
Wait, you guys...

748
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:42,370
Are you guys...

749
00:25:42,370 --> 00:25:42,490
Oh.

750
00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:44,490
I think we should go home.

751
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:45,110
We should turtle.

752
00:25:45,290 --> 00:25:45,650
We should turtle.

753
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:47,430
Guys, I got ricochet.

754
00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:47,950
It's over.

755
00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:49,330
I can actually contribute.

756
00:25:49,730 --> 00:25:50,190
Oh, yeah.

757
00:25:50,530 --> 00:25:51,310
Oh, yeah.

758
00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:58,210
I can finally do something.

759
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:00,150
Her power spike.

760
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:04,070
I'm dead.

761
00:26:04,450 --> 00:26:06,090
Oh, my god.

762
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:06,650
Okay.

763
00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:08,290
Okay.

764
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:11,690
Guys, it's okay.

765
00:26:11,730 --> 00:26:12,190
I have ricochet.

766
00:26:15,730 --> 00:26:16,450
It's okay.

767
00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:17,730
Did you apply for citizenship yet?

768
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:18,410
Oh, yeah.

769
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:20,350
By the way, I got one...

770
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:21,010
Step one done.

771
00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:22,330
Step one is over.

772
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:24,270
Oh, it's over for them.

773
00:26:26,090 --> 00:26:26,490
Oh.

774
00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:28,610
By the way, I got chased.

775
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:31,610
You're their own people.

776
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:32,670
Why would they do that?

777
00:26:33,910 --> 00:26:36,330
I was trying to apply for citizenship.

778
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:38,030
Why would they do that to me?

779
00:26:38,050 --> 00:26:39,110
You're doing it right now.

780
00:26:40,090 --> 00:26:41,610
I don't like those liking you.

781
00:26:43,130 --> 00:26:43,850
Me too.

782
00:26:43,850 --> 00:26:44,990
I would like...

783
00:26:44,990 --> 00:26:45,930
Yeah, maybe we could all...

784
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:46,250
Can we like...

785
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:49,810
Maybe if we pause the game for like seven hours and then we all like...

786
00:26:49,810 --> 00:26:50,370
Get on a flight.

787
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:53,790
Get the closest European country and then just land there.

788
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:55,190
British.

789
00:26:55,330 --> 00:26:56,270
We get on British Airway.

790
00:26:56,550 --> 00:26:57,170
British Airway.

791
00:26:57,250 --> 00:27:02,330
Go to London and then all of us land there and then unpause the game and then we win.

792
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:03,930
We catch up with 50 points.

793
00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:05,550
Yeah, I'm down.

794
00:27:07,030 --> 00:27:07,330
That's...

795
00:27:07,330 --> 00:27:07,830
It'll be just...

796
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:09,150
It's just that easy, right?

797
00:27:11,850 --> 00:27:12,610
I'm down.

798
00:27:12,730 --> 00:27:14,410
I mean, this sounds like a plan of attack.

799
00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:15,250
Yeah, yeah.

800
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:16,910
Honestly, I feel...

801
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:20,990
Someone was like, but Britain's not EU.

802
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:22,530
They're not in the European Union.

803
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:23,790
True, that's true.

804
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:32,230
What the fuck?

805
00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:33,610
It's a sleep.

806
00:27:33,850 --> 00:27:35,490
Tether, tether, tether, tether.

807
00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:37,450
Guys, I need help with a fucking...

808
00:27:37,450 --> 00:27:38,750
There's two people on me.

809
00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:39,130
Guys, I need help with a fucking...

810
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:42,250
They're not on you, they're on our base.

811
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:43,010
Oh, okay.

812
00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:45,350
But I'm in the base, so technically they're on me.

813
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:50,230
I think the patron might be American.

814
00:27:50,810 --> 00:27:52,250
Yes, he's North American.

815
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:53,710
Our fucking patron's a traitor.

816
00:27:54,690 --> 00:27:55,330
Come on, dude.

817
00:27:55,610 --> 00:28:00,790
Okay, so our issue was that we didn't have a single European player.

818
00:28:00,990 --> 00:28:02,470
I think that was our problem.

819
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:03,290
I did not.

820
00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:09,070
How do you know a bunch of European people?

821
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:10,390
All right, okay.

822
00:28:10,930 --> 00:28:15,770
Maybe, like, we can grab a European people in person and just be like, can we pause so we can swap?

823
00:28:16,690 --> 00:28:20,330
Can we pause so we can, like, there's something wrong with our accounts and then...

824
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:26,070
Wait, was the server...

825
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:27,190
Did we pick the server or...

826
00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:31,910
No, they said they were going to pick a server that's, like, the closest to all of us.

827
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:33,510
But it's clearly not.

828
00:28:34,810 --> 00:28:39,690
There's no way this is the closest server, because I play with Europeans.

829
00:28:41,130 --> 00:28:43,410
And I've never lagged this badly before.

830
00:28:44,650 --> 00:28:45,110
Yeah.

831
00:28:46,530 --> 00:28:47,110
Hey.

832
00:28:48,090 --> 00:28:49,250
You live and you learn.

833
00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:50,890
Yeah, we live and we learn.

834
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:51,850
Not bad, not bad.

835
00:28:52,210 --> 00:28:53,390
We should be, like...

836
00:28:53,390 --> 00:28:55,070
Oh, it's... Yeah, it's auto select region.

837
00:28:55,690 --> 00:28:56,830
What region are we in?

838
00:28:59,290 --> 00:29:00,510
What's our region?

839
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:06,590
Didn't we have played US East to even it out between EU and anyone on, like, West Coast?

840
00:29:07,430 --> 00:29:09,730
I just... Yeah, it should be, like, on the left side, right?

841
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:11,310
I mean, it should be London, right?

842
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:15,310
Oh, no.

843
00:29:15,690 --> 00:29:16,630
I've never played in London.

844
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:17,210
Bro, I...

845
00:29:17,210 --> 00:29:17,730
There's no London.

846
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:18,350
I played...

847
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:19,770
I played League.

848
00:29:21,850 --> 00:29:23,290
What server did they play?

849
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:25,010
What was... No, there's England.

850
00:29:25,650 --> 00:29:26,190
Was it England?

851
00:29:26,910 --> 00:29:28,270
We should have just picked, like, South Africa.

852
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:29,290
What if we were in Finland?

853
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:30,310
Wait, we're all lagging.

854
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:30,990
I played...

855
00:29:31,490 --> 00:29:33,890
I... Okay, I don't even know.

856
00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:34,730
Wait, I'm gonna mess it up.

857
00:29:34,810 --> 00:29:35,270
We've been okay in Finland.

858
00:29:35,670 --> 00:29:36,550
Oh, my God.

859
00:29:36,730 --> 00:29:37,850
That was actually...

860
00:29:37,850 --> 00:29:38,930
Hey, Doki, complain!

861
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:39,670
Complain!

862
00:29:41,810 --> 00:29:43,810
Oh, no, they're saying sorry.

863
00:29:47,610 --> 00:29:48,890
Apparently, they're, like...

864
00:29:48,890 --> 00:29:49,570
Sorry, we did...

865
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:50,410
They actually apologized.

866
00:29:50,730 --> 00:29:51,870
They're, like, sorry, we...

867
00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:53,290
For the lag.

868
00:29:53,390 --> 00:29:55,290
And then, apparently, we've been running it on...

869
00:29:56,850 --> 00:30:00,170
And apparently, our game was the worst the lag has ever been.

870
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:02,110
That's crazy.

871
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:04,980
It's a good vibe, you know?

872
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:09,230
Our game was the worst the lag has ever been.

873
00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:13,070
It is what it is.

874
00:30:14,530 --> 00:30:16,530
Do we play next, or do we go to the winners?

875
00:30:18,870 --> 00:30:21,710
So, it's first to one.

876
00:30:22,810 --> 00:30:24,370
Little European situation.

877
00:30:24,930 --> 00:30:26,670
Oh, our next match is against Americans.

878
00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:28,090
Our next match is against Americans.

879
00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:29,570
It's over.

880
00:30:29,570 --> 00:30:31,330
It's win-win, it's over.

881
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:37,070
I kind of liked the European ping, though.

882
00:30:37,290 --> 00:30:38,090
No, you did not.

883
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:40,870
You were, like, Stockholm Syndrome'd yourself, dude.

884
00:30:42,610 --> 00:30:44,710
That very felt good.

885
00:30:46,150 --> 00:30:50,470
There was only three players that had sub 100 ping.

886
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:51,090
There was...

887
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:56,950
Those three players had to be on the other team, because it wasn't us.

888
00:30:57,450 --> 00:30:59,110
I think they were three, America, three of you.

889
00:31:02,990 --> 00:31:05,690
I think I got reyfelted six times.

890
00:31:07,210 --> 00:31:10,550
Bro, I was, like, stuttering so hard.

891
00:31:10,890 --> 00:31:12,810
Like, my frame...

892
00:31:12,810 --> 00:31:16,810
Like, my guy was, like, fucking five frames per second because of the lag.

893
00:31:17,490 --> 00:31:19,430
If we were European, this could have never happened.

894
00:31:19,630 --> 00:31:20,370
That's so true.

895
00:31:20,970 --> 00:31:21,530
We should have...

896
00:31:22,530 --> 00:31:23,770
Oh, my God.

897
00:31:23,930 --> 00:31:25,210
We knew we would...

898
00:31:25,210 --> 00:31:27,550
Both all of us would have just left NA yesterday.

899
00:31:27,930 --> 00:31:28,770
Yeah, we would have just moved to Europe.

900
00:31:28,770 --> 00:31:31,030
Wait, I got the plant yesterday.

901
00:31:31,670 --> 00:31:32,450
At a business expense.

902
00:31:32,450 --> 00:31:35,850
Okay, before our next game, we all order some fish and chips.

903
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:36,650
Yeah, just...

904
00:31:36,650 --> 00:31:37,890
No, we're playing against Americans.

905
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:39,050
We're playing...

906
00:31:39,050 --> 00:31:40,270
We're playing against Americans.

907
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:41,260
I didn't know that it's gonna...

908
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:42,450
You deserve it.

909
00:31:45,330 --> 00:31:47,590
I'm eating a jacket potato with some beans.

910
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:48,710
I can't believe it.

911
00:31:48,770 --> 00:31:50,050
I couldn't even use my...

912
00:31:50,050 --> 00:31:51,110
I don't even use my...

913
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:52,490
A jacket potato?

914
00:31:53,130 --> 00:31:55,450
With some baked beans and tuna.

915
00:31:56,490 --> 00:31:56,810
Tuna?

916
00:31:57,810 --> 00:31:58,750
Yeah, some tuna.

917
00:31:59,730 --> 00:32:00,610
Beans are fire.

918
00:32:01,290 --> 00:32:03,290
You know, guys, I was like literally in a meeting.

919
00:32:03,730 --> 00:32:04,070
Yeah?

920
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:04,710
What's up?

921
00:32:04,850 --> 00:32:06,870
Oh, yeah, yeah.

922
00:32:06,870 --> 00:32:08,510
So you had your own AI play?

923
00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:11,910
Bro, I was farming against McGuinness.

924
00:32:12,050 --> 00:32:13,570
And I was like, wow, this is really laggy.

925
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:14,770
And mid-meeting, I'm like, yeah.

926
00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:19,110
So, you know, the thing about that is we can just look to do some, you know, we can...

927
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:21,450
I thought you were trolling when you said that yesterday.

928
00:32:21,970 --> 00:32:23,990
No, I literally had a meeting at 12.

929
00:32:24,170 --> 00:32:24,550
I was...

930
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:26,150
I told Gumi, I was like, I'll be in a meeting.

931
00:32:26,150 --> 00:32:26,330
Yeah.

932
00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:32,330
He's in a meeting for the first 15 minutes of laning.

933
00:32:32,870 --> 00:32:39,390
I'm like, if you don't get the TPS reports, the viewership analysis of that, I'm just like getting punched to death by McGuinness.

934
00:32:39,530 --> 00:32:39,830
I was like...

935
00:32:43,790 --> 00:32:45,070
But I don't...

936
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:46,650
Who had to lane against Abrams?

937
00:32:46,770 --> 00:32:47,830
I'm sorry for you.

938
00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:49,110
Sorry, Void.

939
00:32:49,330 --> 00:32:49,530
Void.

940
00:32:50,090 --> 00:32:55,350
I think maybe for our next draft, we should draft Abrams and Shiv first.

941
00:32:55,770 --> 00:32:57,410
I think they had first pick.

942
00:32:57,410 --> 00:32:57,970
They knew.

943
00:32:58,270 --> 00:32:59,630
You can't tell me they didn't know.

944
00:32:59,690 --> 00:33:00,530
They picked Abrams.

945
00:33:00,690 --> 00:33:01,430
Yeah, I got the plan.

946
00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:02,010
I got the plan.

947
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:04,970
We first ban Kelvin, first pick Abrams.

948
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:05,690
No, we...

949
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:10,190
No, how about we just ban Abrams in general and nobody can have it?

950
00:33:10,270 --> 00:33:10,850
I don't know.

951
00:33:11,410 --> 00:33:13,130
We have three Abrams players though.

952
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:13,990
Yeah.

953
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:16,890
Yeah, to make it fair, you ban it so none of you can play.

954
00:33:17,690 --> 00:33:19,630
And then nobody can be happy.

955
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:25,170
Well, if it's on NA ping, I don't...

956
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:26,490
It's NA ping, by the way.

957
00:33:26,490 --> 00:33:28,750
Yeah, next team is versus Americans.

958
00:33:29,170 --> 00:33:30,910
I wanted to know what my ping...

959
00:33:30,910 --> 00:33:31,670
What do you guys think about the Kelvin ban?

960
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:33,010
Frick that guy.

961
00:33:33,930 --> 00:33:34,390
I...

962
00:33:34,390 --> 00:33:35,490
I don't know what you can ban.

963
00:33:35,610 --> 00:33:36,970
I don't know what's a good ban character.

964
00:33:37,290 --> 00:33:38,190
I don't think any of us play him.

965
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:38,790
Yeah.

966
00:33:40,170 --> 00:33:41,790
I got a Kelvin game in.

967
00:33:42,490 --> 00:33:43,070
I lost.

968
00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:44,090
Oh.

969
00:33:44,490 --> 00:33:46,570
Okay, well then, yeah.

970
00:33:46,730 --> 00:33:48,010
Yeah, let's make sure to ban it.

971
00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:51,610
Sounds good.

972
00:33:51,690 --> 00:33:52,170
Sounds good.

973
00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:53,710
That's toxic.

974
00:33:54,890 --> 00:33:57,870
Hold on, I'm reading the learn to play section real quick.

975
00:33:57,870 --> 00:33:58,230
Okay.

976
00:33:58,790 --> 00:34:00,250
I'm learning to play, I'm learning to play.

977
00:34:00,650 --> 00:34:02,930
I'm doing the four minute get started tutorial.

978
00:34:03,190 --> 00:34:03,650
Oh, true.

979
00:34:04,090 --> 00:34:04,710
I'm putting up Kelvin in the sandbox.

980
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:05,550
Breakdown of the tutorials.

981
00:34:07,490 --> 00:34:10,450
I have the eight minute lane training incompleted.

982
00:34:12,090 --> 00:34:13,650
What does that even mean?

983
00:34:14,170 --> 00:34:14,410
We can even...

984
00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:16,110
Oh,

985
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:21,500
apparently my stream died.

986
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:23,140
How the frick did my stream die?

987
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:24,620
It died multiple times, apparently.

988
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:25,320
Me?

989
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:25,540
What the frick?

990
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:26,480
How?

991
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:30,500
Oh, did the pain really?

992
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:33,380
My PC was like, I gotta connect to Europe.

993
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,620
It sounds like that.

994
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,280
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

995
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:43,280
The Europeans took down a PC.

996
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:45,660
I have a question.

997
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:46,520
Yes.

998
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:51,900
The very first Slam Doki, you had like a new PC that was unset up in your...

999
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:53,800
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1000
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:54,580
That was me.

1001
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:56,320
Are you still using it?

1002
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:59,160
Yeah, no, I'm using the new PC.

1003
00:34:59,300 --> 00:34:59,980
Okay, okay.

1004
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:01,300
I was like, ugh, I was sitting there the whole time.

1005
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:02,880
I used it since the last Slam.

1006
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:04,400
Okay, all right.

1007
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:08,220
That's why when you spectated my game, it didn't look dog shit.

1008
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:10,840
You know what's funny?

1009
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:19,380
Like, as a professional, when I watch and the match is in fucking slow motion, you just ignore it and you're like, wow, nice, nice punish there with the...

1010
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:24,380
It's just normal for me at that point.

1011
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:26,220
Everybody complained about...

1012
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:29,000
You were EU in that tournament.

1013
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,400
It was like the first three seconds.

1014
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:37,540
It's only the first three seconds.

1015
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:42,800
Watching you get coached and the game just freezes and Brawl Pro is like, Doki, what's going on over there?

1016
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:48,500
Hey, it worked out in the end.

1017
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:53,800
Are we like right after or like, are they playing another game before us?

1018
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:54,560
I don't know.

1019
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,280
I'm doing the training segment.

1020
00:35:57,080 --> 00:36:00,020
I don't even remember how the schedule goes.

1021
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:01,840
Like if there's a gap in between.

1022
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:06,960
Chat, is there a gap in between or are we up next?

1023
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:08,160
Yeah, chat, you tell us.

1024
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:09,220
Yeah, you tell us.

1025
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:11,400
We just went through some fucking trauma right now.

1026
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:12,240
Yeah, chat will know.

1027
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:15,280
We're not fighting the EU demons like the...

1028
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:21,320
Guys, I need to know what words they're ping.

1029
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:24,440
I need to know what they're ping was.

1030
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:26,080
Everyone talks to him now.

1031
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:28,420
Tell us where they live.

1032
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:33,780
I think our match is supposed to be 1.45-ish PST.

1033
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:35,080
1.45?

1034
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:36,380
What?

1035
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,320
Maybe like another...

1036
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:39,400
Are they going to play the other one first?

1037
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:40,220
Wait, how?

1038
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,440
Okay, I'll be like, can we play...

1039
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:43,520
Wait, our match is in 40 minutes?

1040
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:45,980
I have to go.

1041
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,580
They were in 3-ping.

1042
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:54,460
The AV team was on 3-ms.

1043
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:58,340
World boss, world boss, 7 minutes.

1044
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:02,820
When is our next match?

1045
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:05,040
Because I'll go.

1046
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,360
I have to go.

1047
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:10,340
I think it's 30 to 45 minutes from now.

1048
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:14,280
We can't play with team Doki if Doki leaves.

1049
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:18,000
It's going to be team Doki in parentheses.

1050
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:18,680
No bird.

1051
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:19,620
I'm not there.

1052
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:20,600
I'm like the...

1053
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:21,580
I'm like the org leader.

1054
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:22,860
You know, the org leader.

1055
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:24,760
I'm the org.

1056
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:27,600
That's you.

1057
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:28,240
That's me.

1058
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:30,780
Wait, if we have that long, we could definitely move.

1059
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:34,840
Yeah, I was going to say, can we have our next...

1060
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:35,740
Our match up...

1061
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:37,100
Match next, if possible.

1062
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:38,300
No, I meant to Europe, but...

1063
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:38,800
Oh, wait.

1064
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:39,280
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

1065
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:40,300
Europe, yeah.

1066
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,640
Why don't we just move to Europe?

1067
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:44,640
Oh, true.

1068
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:47,220
Yeah, what if we didn't consider moving them to North America?

1069
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:48,020
That's...

1070
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:49,020
Yeah, why can't they move?

1071
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:52,340
No, because the tournament's hosted in London.

1072
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:53,260
They can come too.

1073
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:54,620
Oh, yeah, true.

1074
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,840
And SageM's going to pay for it, right?

1075
00:37:57,260 --> 00:37:57,460
Yeah.

1076
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:58,600
Yeah, we can slam.

1077
00:37:58,880 --> 00:37:59,940
Let's make it happen.

1078
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:02,360
Let's make Deadlock slam.

1079
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:03,880
Brick it.

1080
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:07,440
You know, running tournaments costs a lot of money.

1081
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:09,580
Get all the fighting game players to play Deadlock.

1082
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,360
Well, you just have to win the tournament and you get money back.

1083
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:12,220
Oh, true.

1084
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,000
Oh, that's true, yeah.

1085
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:14,640
Yeah.

1086
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,500
Wait, does this tournament even have a prize?

1087
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:17,520
No, it's for charity.

1088
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:21,060
We were complaining for charity.

1089
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:25,360
Yeah, who was complaining about paying?

1090
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:26,660
It was for the kids.

1091
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:27,640
How could you?

1092
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:29,120
You know what's funny about that?

1093
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:34,380
It's like whenever I work a charity event, I literally don't look at the talking points and I just say, for the kids, guys.

1094
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:35,820
Like, that's like, I just...

1095
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:36,880
I'm like, guys, it's for the kids.

1096
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:41,160
We're the children, guys.

1097
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,200
They're very important.

1098
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:45,000
All right, let's see.

1099
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:46,480
Okay, yeah.

1100
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:47,760
It's literally in...

1101
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:50,780
Oh, yeah.

1102
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:52,280
It's gonna be a while.

1103
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:54,480
It's at 45 minutes.

1104
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:55,580
Oh, okay.

1105
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:58,700
He has to literally go at two.

1106
00:38:59,260 --> 00:38:59,380
Yeah.

1107
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:02,260
Yeah, I have to get subbed out.

1108
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,380
Can we hire our own sub?

1109
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,220
I'm sure if we're in here.

1110
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:14,020
Oh, my God, I forgot.

1111
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,640
I literally looked up fish and chips.

1112
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:19,400
I can't believe...

1113
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,520
I guess we got an excavator.

1114
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:22,780
I mean, I'm down for sure.

1115
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:27,100
What happens if we get a sub and then we qualify for tomorrow?

1116
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,740
We do day two.

1117
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:30,500
And by the way, I didn't think we're gonna...

1118
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:32,320
Guys, we're not gonna qualify.

1119
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,120
It's at six in the morning tomorrow.

1120
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:35,760
It's at six in the morning?

1121
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:43,680
I'm learning so much about this tournament as it goes.

1122
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:45,180
Like, there's so many things I didn't know.

1123
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:47,420
I didn't know either.

1124
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:51,620
Because I didn't say anything because I knew we're not gonna get day two after that.

1125
00:39:54,620 --> 00:40:05,300
Guys, I decided to omit that information because I felt like there was no possibility that we were gonna get to day two.

1126
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:06,960
What kind of belief is this?

1127
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:07,880
What do you mean?

1128
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:08,800
I'm about to lock in.

1129
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:09,100
Hold on.

1130
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:10,860
We're not gonna be locked in.

1131
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:13,140
We're gonna be fighting other European teams.

1132
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,320
I'm missing the frame.

1133
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:20,380
If we win against the NA team, we have to play that European team again.

1134
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,020
Oh, then it's over for them.

1135
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:23,960
I'm moving to EU.

1136
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:24,900
I'm locking in.

1137
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:25,760
It's done.

1138
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:26,800
Like, I'm about to...

1139
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:27,120
Hold on.

1140
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,260
I'm about to learn Swedish.

1141
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:30,520
Like, I'm about to beat their ass.

1142
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:30,820
Hold on.

1143
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:33,860
They're speaking English.

1144
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:34,340
What are you...

1145
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:43,760
They're gonna need a translator if they want to talk to me.

1146
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:44,700
I'm about to lock in.

1147
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:45,020
Hold on.

1148
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:45,920
I'm about to be European.

1149
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:51,100
Can't fucking immigrate right now just for deadlock.

1150
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,400
Oh my god.

1151
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:58,840
It's all right, guys.

1152
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:01,000
For that one game, we put...

1153
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,860
I can't believe we have to wait 45 minutes.

1154
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:05,080
Yeah.

1155
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:06,520
What are we gonna do?

1156
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:08,120
I mean, I can play...

1157
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:08,560
Let's pick it up again.

1158
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:08,940
All right.

1159
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:10,340
I can play like...

1160
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:13,360
Okay, if they don't start at exactly...

1161
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:16,240
If they start like late, then I definitely can't do it.

1162
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:19,180
But like, if they start early, I can do the second match.

1163
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:20,140
What do you have to go do?

1164
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:21,740
I have another stream scheduled.

1165
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:22,420
I had a collab.

1166
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:23,640
Oh no.

1167
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:23,920
I had like two...

1168
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:25,600
Do they play deadlock?

1169
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:27,800
Exactly.

1170
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:29,680
Maybe they can sub in.

1171
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:33,180
I don't think they can sub in here.

1172
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:34,380
Okay, let's just...

1173
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:36,580
Should we just six-stack right now and see what...

1174
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:38,560
Play the game as it's intended?

1175
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:40,020
Oh, yeah.

1176
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:40,420
Yeah.

1177
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:43,260
We might as well play the game as it was intended.

1178
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:45,240
Wait, I haven't seen...

1179
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:46,140
Do we even have time though?

1180
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:47,300
What if our game goes long?

1181
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:49,100
Fucking do you really think?

1182
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:51,580
What if one of them gets stomped?

1183
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:53,000
What if they have like a 10-minute game?

1184
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:53,840
Then we'll just leave.

1185
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:55,140
I'm pretty sure we can't get...

1186
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:55,360
Oh, true.

1187
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:56,060
You're right.

1188
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:57,820
There's no rank yet.

1189
00:41:58,020 --> 00:41:59,280
We could just leave.

1190
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:00,560
Oh, right.

1191
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:03,020
You would leave a game in progress?

1192
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:04,180
Yes.

1193
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:06,500
You would leave...

1194
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:07,800
You've seen me in SageAnne's Lab.

1195
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:08,340
If Doki dodges...

1196
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:12,180
You would dodge a game in progress?

1197
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:12,780
That's true.

1198
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:15,520
Only Doki if he dodges and the rest of us can legally leave.

1199
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:16,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1200
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:19,240
If Doki dodges, it's good for the rest of us.

1201
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:21,920
Yeah, I dodge because I'll just be like, get the sub in.

1202
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:25,780
By the way, you guys should find a backup sub right now.

1203
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:30,280
The idea of leaving a game in progress to me is like...

1204
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:32,460
That's against the rules.

1205
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:33,220
You can't do that.

1206
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:36,220
It's not in the terms of service.

1207
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:37,440
Oh.

1208
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:39,960
Do you know that for sure?

1209
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:40,580
I don't know.

1210
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:41,860
You're gonna fact check me?

1211
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:44,020
Go fucking read the terms of service.

1212
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:45,340
All right, hold on.

1213
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:49,480
In section 1.8, zombies are from the top.

1214
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:53,960
We got time.

1215
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:54,660
All right.

1216
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:56,920
Okay, who's making the lobby?

1217
00:42:57,940 --> 00:42:58,940
I'm in Goomy's Lobby.

1218
00:42:59,260 --> 00:43:00,180
You'll queue without me and Ray.

1219
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:00,960
We're on third limited.

1220
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:02,760
What do you mean queue without you?

1221
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:04,680
What do you mean queue without you?

1222
00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:06,760
Ray is deafened.

1223
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:07,840
He's locked in.

1224
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:09,320
What is happening to this team?

1225
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:11,220
You guys are doing an MMO boss?

1226
00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:13,720
I got someone leaving at 2 p.m.

1227
00:43:13,780 --> 00:43:16,000
I need to play a real game, guys.

1228
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:17,160
Oh, now you want to win.

1229
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:20,800
No, I just want to know what it's like to play a real game.

1230
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:24,240
You know, we all played together last night.

1231
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:26,780
Yeah, and I was busy last night.

1232
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:33,080
Okay, I need to know what it's like to play a real game, guys.

1233
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:33,640
Come on.

1234
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:35,200
How many MMOs have you played?

1235
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:35,800
Huh?

1236
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:37,640
How many games have you played?

1237
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:39,620
Oh, that's a good question.

1238
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:40,920
Let's see how many hours I have.

1239
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:42,420
Like...

1240
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:46,960
I have...

1241
00:43:47,660 --> 00:43:50,040
Okay, to be fair, I had the game open too sometimes.

1242
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:55,860
So I had the game opened for 17 hours, but I know for sure I didn't play 17 hours of games.

1243
00:43:56,520 --> 00:44:03,600
I think I've had maybe like at least 10 games.

1244
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:05,700
All right.

1245
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:06,640
That's pretty good.

1246
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:09,220
I think it's pretty good.

1247
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:13,240
Are you seeing my stats?

1248
00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:16,220
Wait, Gumi, are we...

1249
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:17,620
Gumi, invite me.

1250
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:19,600
Invite me to your group.

1251
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:21,080
You're not even online!

1252
00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:22,060
Yes, I am!

1253
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:23,020
Oh, not like...

1254
00:44:23,020 --> 00:44:25,040
You're not online on Steam!

1255
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:26,540
Oh, you can send our code, yeah.

1256
00:44:26,860 --> 00:44:27,660
Yeah, you can send...

1257
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:28,200
Yeah, the code.

1258
00:44:29,180 --> 00:44:30,300
Send me the code.

1259
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:33,700
Copy party code.

1260
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:36,780
Okay, let me make sure I don't show the code to people.

1261
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:38,180
All right.

1262
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:39,500
Oh.

1263
00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:43,460
One, two, three, four, five.

1264
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:44,300
I'm in.

1265
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:47,680
Our party contains a wide skill range of players.

1266
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:48,700
I'm in.

1267
00:44:51,690 --> 00:44:52,950
Toki must be really good.

1268
00:44:53,470 --> 00:44:54,790
Yeah, I'm too high.

1269
00:44:54,810 --> 00:44:55,730
We skewed our MMR.

1270
00:44:55,890 --> 00:44:57,150
I'm too high for you guys.

1271
00:44:58,270 --> 00:44:59,410
Yeah, so that's...

1272
00:44:59,410 --> 00:45:01,130
You might make us fight two tough opponents.

1273
00:45:01,330 --> 00:45:02,090
Oh, no.

1274
00:45:10,470 --> 00:45:12,930
Are we getting Ramblin and Ray in here?

1275
00:45:14,050 --> 00:45:14,970
I'd love to.

1276
00:45:15,810 --> 00:45:16,490
Right, guys?

1277
00:45:16,850 --> 00:45:17,470
Right, Ramblin?

1278
00:45:18,650 --> 00:45:19,050
Ramblin?

1279
00:45:19,650 --> 00:45:22,410
I mean, I can join, but you think that a team of mine will be paused for five minutes?

1280
00:45:23,990 --> 00:45:25,290
Come on, get in here.

1281
00:45:27,010 --> 00:45:29,570
I want to know what it's like to play a real game.

1282
00:45:32,090 --> 00:45:34,210
I can't believe they're world bossing.

1283
00:45:35,350 --> 00:45:36,350
I'm hopping on.

1284
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:54,120
Wait, did somebody actually have three ping?

1285
00:45:54,860 --> 00:45:55,200
Yes.

1286
00:45:57,820 --> 00:45:58,560
Name them.

1287
00:46:01,860 --> 00:46:06,420
That's what I get to like the US, the California Valorant server.

1288
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:15,820
That's why I was so surprised that the auto select favored that, favored one region, because only three of them had 3ms.

1289
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:19,380
While, like, overall, it should be like...

1290
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:20,480
It should have found the middle.

1291
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:23,860
It should have found the middle.

1292
00:46:25,460 --> 00:46:26,480
Ramblin, type him in.

1293
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:28,440
Liberty, throw my...

1294
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:29,740
Oh.

1295
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:31,380
Ray, can you hear us?

1296
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:32,580
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1297
00:46:33,220 --> 00:46:33,980
You joining us?

1298
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:35,900
For what?

1299
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:37,240
Is the game starting?

1300
00:46:38,020 --> 00:46:39,100
Yeah, the game is starting.

1301
00:46:39,220 --> 00:46:40,120
Turn the game right now.

1302
00:46:40,220 --> 00:46:40,760
Go, come on.

1303
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:43,520
Is it actually a turn a game or...

1304
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:44,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1305
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:45,220
Our game just got up.

1306
00:46:45,380 --> 00:46:46,540
Yeah, you have...

1307
00:46:46,540 --> 00:46:48,180
They decided to move our game up.

1308
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:49,880
Oh, I'm coming, I'm coming.

1309
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:52,980
Sorry, I'm just trying to kill this world boss real quick.

1310
00:46:53,260 --> 00:46:54,300
Sorry, we'll just auto it to death.

1311
00:46:57,080 --> 00:46:57,980
I'm coming, I'm coming.

1312
00:47:01,130 --> 00:47:03,030
No, I'm starting to feel bad.

1313
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:04,830
Why is no one else cracking?

1314
00:47:05,790 --> 00:47:06,490
What do you mean?

1315
00:47:06,570 --> 00:47:07,450
Why are you feeling bad?

1316
00:47:08,290 --> 00:47:08,910
Don't be nervous.

1317
00:47:09,030 --> 00:47:10,230
Yeah, don't be nervous.

1318
00:47:10,330 --> 00:47:11,750
We're playing N18 this time.

1319
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:13,550
So what's the code?

1320
00:47:13,730 --> 00:47:13,930
What's the code?

1321
00:47:14,130 --> 00:47:14,450
Yeah.

1322
00:47:16,940 --> 00:47:21,870
This one, put it in the join party portion.

1323
00:47:24,250 --> 00:47:25,270
I'm in.

1324
00:47:28,170 --> 00:47:30,150
Okay, lock in your character.

1325
00:47:35,890 --> 00:47:44,030
I want to play an experience with their Abramad.

1326
00:47:45,450 --> 00:47:46,650
It just sounds so awesome.

1327
00:47:47,810 --> 00:47:49,030
Are their Abramad three ping?

1328
00:47:49,390 --> 00:47:52,970
Yeah, but I'm fighting against somebody who has 150 ping.

1329
00:47:53,290 --> 00:47:55,230
You want to fight somebody who has 100 ping?

1330
00:47:56,610 --> 00:48:00,450
Like, dude, my heavy melees would go in.

1331
00:48:02,210 --> 00:48:03,350
You know what's fun?

1332
00:48:03,610 --> 00:48:06,170
Like, okay, so the fighting game player in me was like, oh, it's laggy.

1333
00:48:06,230 --> 00:48:07,110
I should just punch them.

1334
00:48:07,270 --> 00:48:08,450
And they immediately parried me.

1335
00:48:08,530 --> 00:48:09,710
And I was like, what's happening here?

1336
00:48:09,770 --> 00:48:11,090
And I was like, what's going on?

1337
00:48:11,570 --> 00:48:12,830
I was like, what is this?

1338
00:48:15,630 --> 00:48:19,730
Like that's, you know, when it's laggy and fighting games, you, you abuse the lag tactic.

1339
00:48:19,930 --> 00:48:22,830
There's so many things for you to be cheesy in fighting games with lag.

1340
00:48:22,950 --> 00:48:25,370
So I was like, oh, I'll just abuse the lag tactics.

1341
00:48:25,390 --> 00:48:27,050
And I punched and I was like, oh, my bad.

1342
00:48:28,450 --> 00:48:30,230
They parried me so fast.

1343
00:48:31,210 --> 00:48:32,450
They were gaming.

1344
00:48:33,130 --> 00:48:36,270
I'm pretty sure like they could see you like 100 frames ahead.

1345
00:48:36,310 --> 00:48:40,930
Like at that point, like you were just slow motion parrying.

1346
00:48:41,870 --> 00:48:42,270
Yeah.

1347
00:48:43,270 --> 00:48:43,670
Yeah.

1348
00:48:43,810 --> 00:48:45,910
I was like, oh, there's no way they're going to be ready.

1349
00:48:46,010 --> 00:48:50,150
I mean, people on North American ping don't like parry that fast.

1350
00:48:50,170 --> 00:48:52,970
Then like, you know, the first time you punch them, I was like, all right.

1351
00:48:53,230 --> 00:48:56,150
I think they just see you and it's like slow-mo for them.

1352
00:48:56,770 --> 00:48:57,570
Oh, true.

1353
00:48:57,890 --> 00:48:59,310
I wonder if that was what it was like.

1354
00:48:59,890 --> 00:49:03,810
Because I was definitely like my, my, my character was not okay.

1355
00:49:04,190 --> 00:49:07,150
She was not, she did not feel okay.

1356
00:49:09,870 --> 00:49:10,670
It's crazy.

1357
00:49:11,250 --> 00:49:12,970
Oh, so my chat was like, I made it.

1358
00:49:13,070 --> 00:49:13,670
Did they win?

1359
00:49:25,830 --> 00:49:26,150
Assimilation.

1360
00:49:26,550 --> 00:49:27,450
We won so hard.

1361
00:49:27,570 --> 00:49:28,990
We became European.

1362
00:49:34,850 --> 00:49:35,810
Oh, my God.

1363
00:49:35,910 --> 00:49:37,770
Wait, are queues really that long?

1364
00:49:38,470 --> 00:49:39,390
Yeah, your skill level is too high.

1365
00:49:39,390 --> 00:49:40,690
Oh, my God.

1366
00:49:40,810 --> 00:49:41,570
Wait, really?

1367
00:49:41,950 --> 00:49:43,030
Oh, I knew it.

1368
00:49:43,130 --> 00:49:45,150
I knew I was better than all of them.

1369
00:49:48,790 --> 00:49:50,230
You knew it was a skill issue.

1370
00:49:51,010 --> 00:49:51,810
Yeah, yeah.

1371
00:49:52,330 --> 00:49:56,690
I think it's because our party has a wide skill range of players.

1372
00:49:56,810 --> 00:49:59,490
So it's just trying to find someone who's as powerful as us.

1373
00:49:59,670 --> 00:50:03,990
Oh, I thought like, I thought Deadlock just goes with the highest MMR.

1374
00:50:04,610 --> 00:50:06,030
It just goes with that because they don't balance.

1375
00:50:06,090 --> 00:50:07,230
I thought they don't balance MMR.

1376
00:50:07,890 --> 00:50:09,290
Individual lanes against each other.

1377
00:50:10,330 --> 00:50:13,310
I actually think they're trying to put us in an EU server.

1378
00:50:14,730 --> 00:50:16,790
Transferring us to EU right now.

1379
00:50:16,910 --> 00:50:26,910
I actually don't know if you noticed this, Void, but I noticed in matches now where I have this logo, it tends to put the highest MMR player in a duo with the lowest MMR in your group.

1380
00:50:26,970 --> 00:50:27,470
Have you seen that?

1381
00:50:27,870 --> 00:50:28,530
I don't know.

1382
00:50:29,390 --> 00:50:31,710
I saw that a couple of times recently.

1383
00:50:31,710 --> 00:50:37,910
What usually happens for me is one of my solo lanes wants to swap.

1384
00:50:38,190 --> 00:50:42,630
So I swap and then I kill them early and the guy I swapped with explodes.

1385
00:50:43,010 --> 00:50:43,550
Yeah, yeah.

1386
00:50:44,730 --> 00:50:48,170
You guys both agreed to smurf is what happened.

1387
00:50:51,030 --> 00:50:53,090
You sacrificed your teammates.

1388
00:50:53,930 --> 00:50:55,030
He sacrificed himself.

1389
00:50:56,050 --> 00:50:56,910
Smurfing is illegal.

1390
00:50:57,070 --> 00:51:00,210
As a boy scout, I would never leave a game in progress or smurf.

1391
00:51:01,710 --> 00:51:01,810
Nerd.

1392
00:51:03,410 --> 00:51:03,610
What?

1393
00:51:10,830 --> 00:51:11,230
What?

1394
00:51:12,150 --> 00:51:12,550
Huh?

1395
00:51:12,610 --> 00:51:13,350
I didn't hear you.

1396
00:51:13,490 --> 00:51:15,350
I was just checking.

1397
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:24,120
Maybe we should get on another account.

1398
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:26,200
Wait, you have other accounts?

1399
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:29,280
I do have another account that I have easy access to.

1400
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:31,140
Well, we did have this.

1401
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:33,140
We had this logo before, so it might not matter.

1402
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:39,740
Wait, are you trying to say you're gonna smurf?

1403
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:43,340
No, I would never.

1404
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:46,360
Well, mama don't know won't hurt her.

1405
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:49,180
Who's mama?

1406
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:50,300
Who's mama?

1407
00:51:50,580 --> 00:51:51,280
Who's that?

1408
00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:52,640
Who's mama?

1409
00:51:53,740 --> 00:51:56,660
Oh yeah, who decided that Gumi was our coach?

1410
00:51:56,860 --> 00:51:57,980
Oh, true, true.

1411
00:51:58,080 --> 00:51:58,540
That is true.

1412
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:00,380
What coach don't know.

1413
00:52:01,220 --> 00:52:05,140
Bro, did you guys hear that this hurricane is so powerful that it's like picking up fire?

1414
00:52:05,140 --> 00:52:05,160
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1415
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:07,240
You're gonna die to Milton.

1416
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:07,820
Oh, we're not dying.

1417
00:52:08,020 --> 00:52:15,220
You're gonna survive through Milton.

1418
00:52:19,780 --> 00:52:22,240
Why did you say that?

1419
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:25,280
That's crazy.

1420
00:52:25,700 --> 00:52:26,940
What the flip?

1421
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:29,620
Oh my god.

1422
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:31,540
One bad Geist game.

1423
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:32,460
One bad Geist game.

1424
00:52:32,460 --> 00:52:34,460
Yeah, you play one game with a hard lane.

1425
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:35,960
What?

1426
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:39,180
One game, hard lane, 150 ping.

1427
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:41,020
I said in Minecraft.

1428
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:47,360
You know what?

1429
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:48,400
Tonight, I'm just opening my door.

1430
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:49,100
I'm running in that.

1431
00:52:49,580 --> 00:52:50,640
Yeah, just get out there.

1432
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:51,340
Go scrap.

1433
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:58,240
The thing is, like, now, if you die, we get to laugh about it.

1434
00:52:58,860 --> 00:53:02,040
Like, it'll be...

1435
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:02,460
No, I'd be...

1436
00:53:02,460 --> 00:53:03,200
I would be crushed.

1437
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:06,480
But I will make fun of Doki for a long time.

1438
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:09,340
I'd be like, why did you do that to him?

1439
00:53:09,820 --> 00:53:13,860
Why did you give the prophecy to him?

1440
00:53:17,020 --> 00:53:21,920
This European hurricane pulled up and pulled him out of his house on 150 MS.

1441
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:25,020
You just sentence him to death.

1442
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:28,460
That's why we have 150 MS.

1443
00:53:28,580 --> 00:53:30,220
The 5G towers are getting taken.

1444
00:53:30,380 --> 00:53:31,520
It was all for charity.

1445
00:53:31,980 --> 00:53:33,560
Wait, yes, I'm linked to the charity.

1446
00:53:33,700 --> 00:53:34,660
I forgot to ping it.

1447
00:53:34,740 --> 00:53:36,400
I forgot to pin it in my chat.

1448
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:37,800
Yes, I will link to it.

1449
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:41,300
Oh, none of you guys linked to charity.

1450
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:42,640
That's...

1451
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:43,340
Wait, what is...

1452
00:53:43,340 --> 00:53:44,800
I was in a meeting.

1453
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:45,960
What am I supposed to put?

1454
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:47,040
Oh, okay.

1455
00:53:47,220 --> 00:53:48,160
Guys, here's the...

1456
00:53:49,660 --> 00:53:50,400
I'll add it.

1457
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:50,880
What is it?

1458
00:53:53,580 --> 00:53:54,500
Yeah, I'll put the code.

1459
00:53:55,220 --> 00:53:56,280
For the kids.

1460
00:53:56,460 --> 00:53:57,060
There we go.

1461
00:53:57,540 --> 00:53:59,100
Yeah, I wrote for the kids.

1462
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:05,980
I mean, him dying for charity would blow up the charity.

1463
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:07,520
And then people would start donating.

1464
00:54:08,380 --> 00:54:11,020
Harsh words, I don't know if you are correct.

1465
00:54:12,940 --> 00:54:14,040
What are you saying?

1466
00:54:16,260 --> 00:54:17,060
This bird.

1467
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:18,500
Calm down.

1468
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:23,680
For the kids, for the kids, for the kids.

1469
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:29,180
Every time Ray dies, we donate one dollar.

1470
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:33,600
Deadlock, of course, right?

1471
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:34,320
For the kids, guys.

1472
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:35,040
For the kids, guys.

1473
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:35,580
It's for the kids.

1474
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:37,640
I'm like Kenny from South Park or something.

1475
00:54:40,020 --> 00:54:40,820
One, one...

1476
00:54:40,820 --> 00:54:43,400
Okay, how many times have you died for the last game?

1477
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:44,900
I mean, we should...

1478
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:47,220
I died like 10 times.

1479
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:48,860
10 times, so that's like $100.

1480
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:51,860
Oh, I thought we were doing times 10.

1481
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:56,360
That's crazy.

1482
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:01,100
You might as well donate a little more if it's for the children, right?

1483
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:03,920
You said blow up the charity, too.

1484
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:05,420
That's a crazy thing to say.

1485
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:07,240
Why did you say it like that?

1486
00:55:07,460 --> 00:55:08,680
Because it'll go viral.

1487
00:55:09,020 --> 00:55:17,660
Because we'd be like, during the hurricane, this man played for the Deadlock tournament.

1488
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:24,860
Even though he was going through one of the biggest hurricanes in America right now.

1489
00:55:25,100 --> 00:55:26,420
And here's the charity link.

1490
00:55:29,100 --> 00:55:30,440
It went viral.

1491
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:31,320
It was.

1492
00:55:31,900 --> 00:55:37,860
When I said I was a Boy Scout, I could be outside doing cocaine and I'd be way less...

1493
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:42,580
I'd be way less evil than what's happening here, I bet.

1494
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:45,120
You have an evil choice already.

1495
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:52,480
I could just be on the corner selling drugs and I'd be like, I'm the morally outstanding one.

1496
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:54,120
I am a good person.

1497
00:55:56,580 --> 00:55:59,220
I'm literally in a charity tournament.

1498
00:55:59,220 --> 00:56:02,820
That just absolves me from all evil.

1499
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:07,820
I'm just like outside selling a bunch of high schoolers fentanyl and I'm like, I'm the good guy on this team.

1500
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:12,440
No, not yet.

1501
00:56:12,540 --> 00:56:14,400
Not yet because you haven't started yet.

1502
00:56:14,980 --> 00:56:15,920
Oh, okay.

1503
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:19,780
Remember guys, shout outs to Milton, you know?

1504
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:21,580
Yeah, shout outs to Milton.

1505
00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:23,700
Milton, man of storm.

1506
00:56:23,700 --> 00:56:24,080
Oh.

1507
00:56:28,180 --> 00:56:28,580
Imagine.

1508
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:29,660
You guys get that reference?

1509
00:56:30,260 --> 00:56:33,980
Yeah, yeah, I got peer pressured.

1510
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:35,160
I wanted to be just as cool.

1511
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:36,240
Wow, right?

1512
00:56:36,660 --> 00:56:36,820
Wrong.

1513
00:56:41,240 --> 00:56:42,440
Millhouse, man of storm.

1514
00:56:44,540 --> 00:56:47,800
Guys, Ray's gonna die.

1515
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:48,960
You gotta laugh at his jokes.

1516
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:56,500
Oh, that's why when you said that reference, we all pretended to know what he was saying to make him feel better.

1517
00:56:57,060 --> 00:56:58,060
Yeah, you know what?

1518
00:56:58,820 --> 00:57:00,000
I'm jumping in this hurricane.

1519
00:57:01,380 --> 00:57:03,760
Wait, before you jump, can you like...

1520
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:05,440
Before you jump, can you link the charity?

1521
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:06,580
I'm taking down my shutters.

1522
00:57:06,700 --> 00:57:07,740
I'm just gonna open my fucking window.

1523
00:57:07,740 --> 00:57:09,480
No, no, no, can you link the charity before you jump?

1524
00:57:13,260 --> 00:57:14,340
I'll record a video.

1525
00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:16,500
You'll record a video?

1526
00:57:16,620 --> 00:57:20,620
I'm gonna make a video where I say Doki's my 13th reason why in the majority of the world.

1527
00:57:22,420 --> 00:57:23,460
Has it happened?

1528
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:25,340
Ray, that's just a $5 dono.

1529
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:26,460
Thank you, Ray.

1530
00:57:28,420 --> 00:57:30,340
$5, big fan of Ray.

1531
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:35,940
Wish, guys, we should all donate to charity in the name of...

1532
00:57:39,860 --> 00:57:41,280
Does it have a message?

1533
00:57:41,700 --> 00:57:42,720
Oh, it doesn't have...

1534
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:45,600
Guys, guys, someone should donate in the name for...

1535
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:47,420
As a memorial to Raytus.

1536
00:57:48,460 --> 00:57:50,860
I think everyone should donate in the name of Raytus.

1537
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:53,640
Yeah, yeah, if you're gonna donate to charity, just be like...

1538
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:55,840
Rest in peace, Raytus.

1539
00:57:55,860 --> 00:57:57,120
Don't say that.

1540
00:57:57,920 --> 00:57:58,680
Doki, no!

1541
00:57:59,700 --> 00:58:00,580
Doki, Doki!

1542
00:58:01,140 --> 00:58:03,000
I'm in Minecraft, in Minecraft.

1543
00:58:04,780 --> 00:58:07,160
There's so many times you can pull that out.

1544
00:58:07,180 --> 00:58:08,800
You can't just end Minecraft your way through life, okay?

1545
00:58:08,840 --> 00:58:10,320
You can't just like...

1546
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:11,660
You're at a job interview, you're like...

1547
00:58:11,660 --> 00:58:12,700
What makes you a bad candidate?

1548
00:58:12,820 --> 00:58:13,940
I do drugs in Minecraft.

1549
00:58:14,120 --> 00:58:14,940
Like, you can't just like...

1550
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:18,840
End Minecraft your way through life, like...

1551
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:22,560
Jeez.

1552
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:24,520
Oh, man.

1553
00:58:24,840 --> 00:58:26,300
It's okay, it's okay, guys.

1554
00:58:26,420 --> 00:58:28,180
We've been in queue for like 15 minutes.

1555
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:28,880
How?

1556
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:30,800
Oh my god.

1557
00:58:31,100 --> 00:58:33,200
This queue is the longest I've seen, I think.

1558
00:58:33,340 --> 00:58:35,280
This is the longest I've been in, I think.

1559
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:36,880
I thought this queue was popular.

1560
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:37,780
What's going on?

1561
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:38,460
But I swear...

1562
00:58:38,460 --> 00:58:39,840
Maybe it's bugged, maybe it's bugged.

1563
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:41,640
Wait, it can get bugged?

1564
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:45,120
I can split it real quick.

1565
00:58:47,220 --> 00:58:50,300
Because the other turning game is at the 10 minute mark.

1566
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:52,040
And then Void Dodge is for us.

1567
00:58:52,040 --> 00:58:53,540
It doesn't look like it's going to last long.

1568
00:58:53,620 --> 00:58:54,480
No, I can...

1569
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:55,240
Yeah, that's true.

1570
00:58:56,340 --> 00:58:56,580
Wait.

1571
00:58:56,720 --> 00:58:58,700
It's not a beatdown, but it...

1572
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:01,440
It looks like it's about to escalate.

1573
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:02,200
Okay.

1574
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:03,340
That's even down five minutes.

1575
00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:04,620
Yeah.

1576
00:59:06,300 --> 00:59:06,980
All right.

1577
00:59:07,380 --> 00:59:08,240
What's the plan?

1578
00:59:08,560 --> 00:59:09,760
Guys, who needs a warm-up?

1579
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:12,300
When you're just such a solid Splatoon like us.

1580
00:59:12,340 --> 00:59:13,080
Like, look at us go.

1581
00:59:13,380 --> 00:59:16,700
I mean, we already warmed up because we're at 150 ping.

1582
00:59:16,780 --> 00:59:18,320
So we're like Rock Lee taking off the weights.

1583
00:59:18,580 --> 00:59:18,880
You know what I'm saying?

1584
00:59:19,100 --> 00:59:19,120
Yeah.

1585
00:59:19,460 --> 00:59:22,060
Guys, I think I barely played the game during that last game.

1586
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:22,860
So I think I...

1587
00:59:22,860 --> 00:59:27,140
I think I need a little bit of warm-up.

1588
00:59:28,120 --> 00:59:30,260
All right, me, you, and...

1589
00:59:30,260 --> 00:59:31,200
Wait, why don't we just go into...

1590
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:31,640
Why don't we drop in an apex?

1591
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:34,900
Let's go into sandbox mode and just practice on each other.

1592
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:35,820
Oh, true.

1593
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:36,600
Sandbox?

1594
00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:37,620
The sandbox?

1595
00:59:37,620 --> 00:59:39,000
Let's get Void back in here.

1596
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:40,080
Void, get back in.

1597
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:42,240
The game is actually starting for real now.

1598
00:59:43,100 --> 00:59:43,960
I'm almost there.

1599
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:47,840
There's the code.

1600
00:59:47,860 --> 00:59:49,900
Did you just have him do 1v1s in a lane?

1601
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:53,900
Wait, but then that's not fair to the person I'm laning against.

1602
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:55,140
Because I'm too good.

1603
00:59:56,280 --> 00:59:57,580
I just got absolutely plucked.

1604
01:00:00,980 --> 01:00:01,860
Unknown joined.

1605
01:00:02,460 --> 01:00:02,760
Who's that?

1606
01:00:02,780 --> 01:00:04,000
Oh, yeah, that's my new name.

1607
01:00:04,420 --> 01:00:04,860
Gulp?

1608
01:00:05,700 --> 01:00:06,800
Is it actually?

1609
01:00:07,460 --> 01:00:08,460
That's the real Voidlock.

1610
01:00:08,460 --> 01:00:11,780
He's so powerful, my Steam can't figure out his name.

1611
01:00:12,420 --> 01:00:13,320
It's Voidlock.

1612
01:00:14,620 --> 01:00:15,700
You not like Bluelock?

1613
01:00:16,580 --> 01:00:17,820
I love Bluelock.

1614
01:00:18,120 --> 01:00:18,760
I do too.

1615
01:00:19,660 --> 01:00:20,380
Let's go.

1616
01:00:23,260 --> 01:00:28,480
Oh, that's your dog, by the way, guys.

1617
01:00:29,320 --> 01:00:30,600
I think your dog did something.

1618
01:00:38,950 --> 01:00:41,250
Do we even have enough time to play an actual game?

1619
01:00:41,710 --> 01:00:42,150
Not really.

1620
01:00:42,470 --> 01:00:43,270
No, I don't think so.

1621
01:00:43,330 --> 01:00:44,070
That's why we're laning.

1622
01:00:47,890 --> 01:00:52,690
Okay, I'll DC all my Smurfs and then we can all DC.

1623
01:00:54,330 --> 01:00:55,550
Oh, the game went a lot more easy.

1624
01:00:55,570 --> 01:00:56,170
We have time.

1625
01:00:56,290 --> 01:00:56,710
We have time.

1626
01:00:58,350 --> 01:00:59,370
Okie, lock in.

1627
01:00:59,630 --> 01:01:00,690
Wait, I have to lock in?

1628
01:01:01,890 --> 01:01:02,530
Okay, I locked in.

1629
01:01:03,790 --> 01:01:05,390
Okay, I'll give it five minutes.

1630
01:01:06,230 --> 01:01:06,730
Five minutes?

1631
01:01:07,350 --> 01:01:08,450
I need to eat a Tums.

1632
01:01:09,170 --> 01:01:10,630
Wait, we're back in a queue?

1633
01:01:11,530 --> 01:01:11,870
Yeah.

1634
01:01:12,350 --> 01:01:12,690
Yeah.

1635
01:01:12,790 --> 01:01:13,790
What happened to Sandbox?

1636
01:01:15,710 --> 01:01:16,710
Do we want a Sandbox?

1637
01:01:17,290 --> 01:01:18,210
I thought we were doing a...

1638
01:01:18,210 --> 01:01:18,930
Oh, it's fine.

1639
01:01:19,070 --> 01:01:20,350
Can we set the Sandbox so you're...

1640
01:01:20,350 --> 01:01:20,950
I don't even care.

1641
01:01:22,750 --> 01:01:25,170
She's actually serious about this.

1642
01:01:33,640 --> 01:01:34,440
All right.

1643
01:01:35,180 --> 01:01:36,080
Look at us.

1644
01:01:37,080 --> 01:01:38,000
Look at our squad.

1645
01:01:38,140 --> 01:01:39,480
Oh my god, look at us.

1646
01:01:39,540 --> 01:01:40,900
I'm buying everything right now.

1647
01:01:41,620 --> 01:01:42,860
All right, we'll ping a Rion.

1648
01:01:43,580 --> 01:01:45,060
I'm changing teams.

1649
01:01:45,220 --> 01:01:45,700
Wait, why?

1650
01:01:48,300 --> 01:01:49,900
This is what they felt like?

1651
01:01:50,780 --> 01:01:51,180
Holy...

1652
01:01:51,180 --> 01:01:52,200
This must be nice.

1653
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:54,240
Oh my god.

1654
01:01:54,340 --> 01:01:54,900
Yeah, I was gonna...

1655
01:01:54,900 --> 01:01:56,520
Or let's practice killing these minions for 30 minutes.

1656
01:01:56,540 --> 01:02:00,200
When I was doing killing minions, I was like, how are they denying me of that?

1657
01:02:03,960 --> 01:02:04,680
That's so cute.

1658
01:02:05,020 --> 01:02:05,900
Don't ult me, please.

1659
01:02:07,360 --> 01:02:08,260
Don't ult me.

1660
01:02:08,340 --> 01:02:09,360
I'm too hot and sexy.

1661
01:02:16,360 --> 01:02:17,200
What the fuck?

1662
01:02:18,840 --> 01:02:19,120
Yo!

1663
01:02:21,120 --> 01:02:22,600
Okay, where's my lane partner?

1664
01:02:23,100 --> 01:02:24,240
Wait, am I solo lane?

1665
01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:26,280
Wait, who bought items?

1666
01:02:27,560 --> 01:02:28,820
What, you didn't?

1667
01:02:31,220 --> 01:02:33,340
I thought we were warming up at level 1 first.

1668
01:02:34,340 --> 01:02:35,320
This is level 1.

1669
01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:35,760
This is level 1.

1670
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:37,040
You don't see a magic carpet Viscous level 1?

1671
01:02:37,060 --> 01:02:39,740
Bro, I saw a magic carpet Viscous and that's all I know.

1672
01:02:45,820 --> 01:02:48,080
I hate the Marauder Beetles sound effect.

1673
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:49,560
Oh, that's...

1674
01:02:49,560 --> 01:02:50,320
No, don't do this.

1675
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:50,680
Oh wait, no.

1676
01:02:51,900 --> 01:02:54,020
Give us flux slots.

1677
01:02:55,660 --> 01:02:56,580
What the fuck?

1678
01:02:58,420 --> 01:02:59,040
I'm gonna...

1679
01:02:59,040 --> 01:02:59,620
I'm grabbing.

1680
01:02:59,720 --> 01:03:01,120
I'm gonna grab that item.

1681
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:01,920
I'm gonna...

1682
01:03:06,120 --> 01:03:06,940
I'm buying.

1683
01:03:07,120 --> 01:03:08,120
I'm fucking buying.

1684
01:03:09,360 --> 01:03:10,800
Get your ass back here.

1685
01:03:14,120 --> 01:03:14,760
What?

1686
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:17,440
Unstoppable.

1687
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:18,840
Where are you?

1688
01:03:19,340 --> 01:03:19,620
No.

1689
01:03:21,040 --> 01:03:23,160
Oh, you guys aren't ready.

1690
01:03:29,880 --> 01:03:31,620
You're fucking cheating.

1691
01:03:31,880 --> 01:03:32,900
You're such a whore.

1692
01:03:35,140 --> 01:03:37,860
I was like, Ray's doing a lot of damage.

1693
01:03:39,220 --> 01:03:40,960
He left clicked me for 300 damage.

1694
01:03:42,500 --> 01:03:50,980
Who the fuck put this at 0 cooldown?

1695
01:03:51,820 --> 01:03:53,900
Who put this at 0 cooldown?

1696
01:03:54,640 --> 01:03:56,500
How is this actual practice?

1697
01:03:57,800 --> 01:04:00,400
There I was in lane, level 1, farming.

1698
01:04:01,140 --> 01:04:03,320
Like a hardworking individual.

1699
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:06,220
And this guy's magic carpet goofballing.

1700
01:04:09,300 --> 01:04:13,720
Oh my god.

1701
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:17,840
What if I can't...

1702
01:04:18,360 --> 01:04:20,220
If I can't beat them?

1703
01:04:32,540 --> 01:04:34,380
That's right, I'm coming for you.

1704
01:04:34,460 --> 01:04:36,080
I'm fucking coming for you.

1705
01:04:40,440 --> 01:04:42,600
Who uses this item?

1706
01:04:42,860 --> 01:04:44,260
Who actually uses magic carpet?

1707
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,280
Look at Ramblin.

1708
01:04:49,380 --> 01:04:50,660
I'm fucking burning.

1709
01:05:03,640 --> 01:05:06,100
What is going on?

1710
01:05:06,560 --> 01:05:08,520
No magic carpet for you.

1711
01:05:08,520 --> 01:05:08,540
No.

1712
01:05:10,350 --> 01:05:11,700
No, I'm just kidding.

1713
01:05:12,100 --> 01:05:14,660
Leave me alone.

1714
01:05:17,060 --> 01:05:18,700
That's looking great.

1715
01:05:26,170 --> 01:05:27,540
Infinite cooldown Naga.

1716
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:29,680
Bro, there's a DBZ battle in the air.

1717
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:31,120
What the fuck is happening?

1718
01:05:32,280 --> 01:05:34,340
Sparking Zero just came out.

1719
01:05:35,080 --> 01:05:36,220
This is insane.

1720
01:05:36,220 --> 01:05:37,780
What the hell is going on?

1721
01:05:47,700 --> 01:05:50,120
Oh my god, get me out of here.

1722
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:54,620
I picked someone who sits on the floor like an idiot.

1723
01:05:54,780 --> 01:05:55,460
Like what am I doing?

1724
01:05:56,680 --> 01:05:58,560
Clearly doing the wrong thing.

1725
01:05:59,940 --> 01:06:02,800
Guys, this is exactly how our tournament match is going to go.

1726
01:06:04,420 --> 01:06:06,340
I'm taking this building to the next game.

1727
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:08,320
You're taking magic carpet?

1728
01:06:08,640 --> 01:06:09,500
Yeah, magic carpet.

1729
01:06:09,780 --> 01:06:11,540
I mean, magic carpet, Viscous is real.

1730
01:06:11,780 --> 01:06:12,820
It's factual meta.

1731
01:06:13,260 --> 01:06:15,300
People want to nerf it.

1732
01:06:15,580 --> 01:06:17,160
It's way too good right now.

1733
01:06:17,240 --> 01:06:20,120
You might as well just play Viscous just for magic carpet.

1734
01:06:26,040 --> 01:06:28,580
You might as well all get knocked down too, just in case.

1735
01:06:33,180 --> 01:06:36,100
We all just buy knockdown just in case.

1736
01:06:43,020 --> 01:06:44,280
That's fucking right.

1737
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:46,080
I'm giving you practice.

1738
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:47,700
What do I look like?

1739
01:06:47,720 --> 01:06:49,040
I'm stealthed on the carpet.

1740
01:06:49,400 --> 01:06:50,220
You're stealthed?

1741
01:06:50,260 --> 01:06:51,200
Wait, where are you?

1742
01:06:56,300 --> 01:06:58,260
I'm going to go find you.

1743
01:06:58,520 --> 01:07:00,780
I guess it doesn't unstealth.

1744
01:07:01,060 --> 01:07:01,640
Curse?

1745
01:07:02,860 --> 01:07:04,080
You bought curse?

1746
01:07:04,380 --> 01:07:05,540
You bought curse?

1747
01:07:06,920 --> 01:07:07,680
Okay, wait.

1748
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:09,880
Oh!

1749
01:07:22,910 --> 01:07:24,530
What the fuck are you?

1750
01:07:24,730 --> 01:07:26,430
You're a monster.

1751
01:07:31,790 --> 01:07:32,570
That's fucked.

1752
01:07:32,630 --> 01:07:34,270
I had to send a message.

1753
01:07:38,310 --> 01:07:40,570
What do you want from me?

1754
01:07:44,010 --> 01:07:45,350
I'm fucking gonna hide.

1755
01:07:46,310 --> 01:07:49,330
If nobody can see where I am, I'll...

1756
01:07:51,770 --> 01:07:55,430
This guy Ramblin's having the time of his fucking life up there, I can tell.

1757
01:07:58,290 --> 01:07:59,090
That's it.

1758
01:08:04,690 --> 01:08:06,470
Why do you think that's it?

1759
01:08:08,270 --> 01:08:09,370
That's it.

1760
01:08:10,210 --> 01:08:11,450
Unstoppable.

1761
01:08:13,910 --> 01:08:15,150
Oh, she's...

1762
01:08:15,150 --> 01:08:17,710
She's like infinitely...

1763
01:08:17,770 --> 01:08:20,270
big chillin'.

1764
01:08:21,290 --> 01:08:22,290
That's it.

1765
01:08:25,790 --> 01:08:27,670
Easiest game of my life.

1766
01:08:31,730 --> 01:08:34,310
I will go on forever.

1767
01:08:38,870 --> 01:08:39,270
Yay!

1768
01:08:42,230 --> 01:08:43,750
I wonder what this looks like.

1769
01:08:43,790 --> 01:08:45,250
Is this just a carpet flying around?

1770
01:08:45,690 --> 01:08:46,950
I don't even see you.

1771
01:08:51,530 --> 01:08:52,930
They took out Bebop.

1772
01:08:53,170 --> 01:08:53,730
Oh, shit.

1773
01:08:53,810 --> 01:08:54,710
No, not Bebop.

1774
01:08:56,290 --> 01:08:58,790
No, not Bebop.

1775
01:08:59,490 --> 01:09:00,610
Anyone but him.

1776
01:09:00,710 --> 01:09:02,750
Oh my god, he's just a silly little guy.

1777
01:09:03,370 --> 01:09:04,630
Bro, what the fuck?

1778
01:09:04,690 --> 01:09:08,250
Oh my god, there's a hazel.

1779
01:09:08,250 --> 01:09:09,290
He's bouncing off his building.

1780
01:09:21,810 --> 01:09:23,410
I think we're ready for you.

1781
01:09:23,590 --> 01:09:24,650
I think we're so ready.

1782
01:09:24,890 --> 01:09:26,230
We're so ready.

1783
01:09:26,730 --> 01:09:27,890
I don't think they can take us.

1784
01:09:28,070 --> 01:09:31,570
I think like, after that training arc of 150...

1785
01:09:32,430 --> 01:09:34,130
I'm pretty sure I was 200 MS.

1786
01:09:34,230 --> 01:09:35,250
Because I'm on West Coast.

1787
01:09:35,810 --> 01:09:37,230
So like, I'm pretty sure I had...

1788
01:09:38,010 --> 01:09:39,230
I'm also West Coast.

1789
01:09:39,690 --> 01:09:40,450
West Coast.

1790
01:09:41,090 --> 01:09:42,750
Yeah, I'm pretty sure I was 200.

1791
01:09:42,910 --> 01:09:44,470
Because I know I'm 200 in Apex.

1792
01:09:45,530 --> 01:09:47,190
Gumi, I swear to fucking god.

1793
01:09:47,990 --> 01:09:48,830
I will...

1794
01:09:48,830 --> 01:09:51,150
I will make sure we get to Day 2.

1795
01:09:51,630 --> 01:09:52,130
If you do...

1796
01:09:52,130 --> 01:09:55,890
Southern California to EU is pretty far.

1797
01:09:56,230 --> 01:09:57,330
That's the worst thing you've said today.

1798
01:10:00,050 --> 01:10:01,570
Yeah, that is crazy.

1799
01:10:01,850 --> 01:10:04,410
When you said you wish Rey died, I thought that was less offensive.

1800
01:10:06,390 --> 01:10:10,210
If you keep doing that, I'll make sure we make it to Day 2.

1801
01:10:10,210 --> 01:10:12,250
I swear to fucking god.

1802
01:10:15,830 --> 01:10:21,730
So, my chat was asking about it, but if people missed it, their team was half EU, right?

1803
01:10:22,030 --> 01:10:22,590
Yeah, yeah.

1804
01:10:22,630 --> 01:10:22,930
Half.

1805
01:10:23,490 --> 01:10:27,650
And then the other half was not, but we played on EU servers where we had like 160 ping.

1806
01:10:27,690 --> 01:10:30,310
Yeah, but the other three were with 3 MS.

1807
01:10:30,750 --> 01:10:31,250
3 ping.

1808
01:10:32,210 --> 01:10:33,390
But they had like...

1809
01:10:33,390 --> 01:10:36,170
Apparently our match was the worst the ping has ever been.

1810
01:10:37,090 --> 01:10:37,870
I mean, I believe that.

1811
01:10:37,870 --> 01:10:39,870
Oh my god.

1812
01:10:43,810 --> 01:10:44,150
Oh my god.

1813
01:10:44,850 --> 01:10:45,930
Oh my god.

1814
01:10:46,910 --> 01:10:49,070
All I'm saying is that...

1815
01:10:49,070 --> 01:10:50,690
Shout out to the guys.

1816
01:10:50,970 --> 01:10:53,030
Shout out to everybody for donating to the charity.

1817
01:10:55,250 --> 01:10:56,370
Guys, because...

1818
01:10:56,370 --> 01:10:56,930
Look in chat.

1819
01:10:57,250 --> 01:10:58,430
Yeah, look in chat, guys.

1820
01:10:59,070 --> 01:10:59,590
And for Rey.

1821
01:11:00,290 --> 01:11:01,830
It's for Rey and the kids.

1822
01:11:02,750 --> 01:11:05,030
In that order.

1823
01:11:05,030 --> 01:11:06,090
Kids first.

1824
01:11:06,390 --> 01:11:07,230
Oh my god.

1825
01:11:11,770 --> 01:11:22,010
You guys are gonna laugh, but wait until he's mid-game and his power goes out and he just disconnects and you never hear from him again.

1826
01:11:26,890 --> 01:11:28,790
That's my boy right there.

1827
01:11:28,830 --> 01:11:30,190
And you're wishing ill will on him?

1828
01:11:30,270 --> 01:11:30,830
That's crazy.

1829
01:11:32,750 --> 01:11:33,350
That's crazy.

1830
01:11:33,550 --> 01:11:36,190
You are very specific about that, Seija.

1831
01:11:36,450 --> 01:11:38,010
You are so specific.

1832
01:11:38,870 --> 01:11:40,510
Are you trying to...

1833
01:11:40,510 --> 01:11:41,790
What are you trying to say?

1834
01:11:42,350 --> 01:11:43,710
What's gonna happen?

1835
01:11:47,430 --> 01:11:48,870
Oh my god.

1836
01:11:48,990 --> 01:11:50,310
I'm gonna plug right now.

1837
01:11:50,390 --> 01:11:51,630
I'm plugging right now.

1838
01:11:54,250 --> 01:11:55,310
I'm gonna plug.

1839
01:11:59,770 --> 01:12:03,510
Dude, that's throw loops.

1840
01:12:03,670 --> 01:12:04,730
That's three-potter right there.

1841
01:12:07,870 --> 01:12:08,670
I'm safe.

1842
01:12:08,810 --> 01:12:10,290
No one will know where I am.

1843
01:12:13,150 --> 01:12:16,550
No one will know where I am because I have to tab out and send a message.

1844
01:12:16,550 --> 01:12:20,230
Gumi Gumi flew right at you.

1845
01:12:20,810 --> 01:12:22,370
Please, I need to type a message.

1846
01:12:22,910 --> 01:12:24,470
Gumi, I swear to god.

1847
01:12:24,470 --> 01:12:27,250
I think the bot is gonna start punching you.

1848
01:12:31,090 --> 01:12:33,610
I'm trying to type a message.

1849
01:12:34,890 --> 01:12:35,970
Is it for charity?

1850
01:12:36,330 --> 01:12:37,650
Yeah, it's for charity.

1851
01:12:38,130 --> 01:12:39,990
Of course, everything I do is for charity.

1852
01:12:41,690 --> 01:12:42,210
Well...

1853
01:12:43,730 --> 01:12:44,250
Well...

1854
01:12:44,250 --> 01:12:45,230
Well, what?

1855
01:12:45,410 --> 01:12:47,170
Well, what?

1856
01:12:48,450 --> 01:12:52,930
I'm watching Voi get his 50 reps of Riju punching in.

1857
01:12:52,930 --> 01:12:54,110
What is Bebop doing here?

1858
01:12:55,910 --> 01:12:56,450
Well, you know.

1859
01:12:57,350 --> 01:12:58,790
I gotta make sure I can punch it.

1860
01:12:59,290 --> 01:13:00,930
How do you check for ping anyway?

1861
01:13:01,230 --> 01:13:02,010
Oh, 13ms.

1862
01:13:02,030 --> 01:13:02,190
Oh,

1863
01:13:05,510 --> 01:13:06,410
27ms.

1864
01:13:06,610 --> 01:13:06,970
There we go.

1865
01:13:07,630 --> 01:13:10,450
Wait, somebody should check what their ping was last match.

1866
01:13:10,750 --> 01:13:11,450
Can we though?

1867
01:13:11,450 --> 01:13:13,650
I know for sure I had 150.

1868
01:13:15,150 --> 01:13:17,590
Wait, no, Seija, you should check because you're closest.

1869
01:13:18,150 --> 01:13:19,330
Wait, you're also SoCal, right?

1870
01:13:19,690 --> 01:13:20,610
Yeah, I'm OC.

1871
01:13:21,350 --> 01:13:22,690
Yeah, so I must have 150 also.

1872
01:13:23,970 --> 01:13:26,650
Oh, I'm in Canada, so RNG is not the best.

1873
01:13:27,190 --> 01:13:29,890
Well, also, you're further north.

1874
01:13:29,930 --> 01:13:31,010
Yeah, I'm further, too.

1875
01:13:31,130 --> 01:13:31,710
I'm further in.

1876
01:13:33,150 --> 01:13:34,150
I covered it.

1877
01:13:34,330 --> 01:13:35,470
I fucked it.

1878
01:13:35,530 --> 01:13:36,230
I covered it.

1879
01:13:37,610 --> 01:13:38,050
Shite.

1880
01:13:39,310 --> 01:13:39,850
Alright.

1881
01:13:40,350 --> 01:13:41,670
I need to send my message.

1882
01:13:44,890 --> 01:13:45,850
Oh, okay.

1883
01:13:47,070 --> 01:13:49,550
By the way, this is our draft link, by the way.

1884
01:13:50,530 --> 01:13:50,750
Huh?

1885
01:13:52,130 --> 01:13:55,310
We could probably do it sooner than later, right?

1886
01:13:57,990 --> 01:13:59,730
The donation's insane.

1887
01:14:00,010 --> 01:14:01,530
You just saw it?

1888
01:14:01,970 --> 01:14:03,290
I didn't even see it.

1889
01:14:03,410 --> 01:14:04,770
I thought we were just trolling.

1890
01:14:09,950 --> 01:14:10,870
That's insane.

1891
01:14:10,950 --> 01:14:12,250
It's for the kids.

1892
01:14:12,390 --> 01:14:12,970
See, Joe?

1893
01:14:14,810 --> 01:14:16,590
I'm a big charity event fan.

1894
01:14:16,690 --> 01:14:17,130
I'm with it.

1895
01:14:17,670 --> 01:14:19,610
Are we drafted?

1896
01:14:20,030 --> 01:14:21,090
They're 40k down.

1897
01:14:23,230 --> 01:14:24,370
Hey, just like us.

1898
01:14:24,730 --> 01:14:26,670
I was gonna say it, but then I stopped myself.

1899
01:14:28,230 --> 01:14:29,170
Wait, what did he do?

1900
01:14:29,890 --> 01:14:30,830
They're down 40k.

1901
01:14:31,810 --> 01:14:32,710
Oh, shit!

1902
01:14:33,030 --> 01:14:33,630
Let's go!

1903
01:14:34,970 --> 01:14:36,110
Wait, who's they?

1904
01:14:36,110 --> 01:14:38,890
The team that we lost against?

1905
01:14:41,050 --> 01:14:42,150
Oh, I forgot.

1906
01:14:42,470 --> 01:14:44,050
One of these teams are the teams we lost against.

1907
01:14:44,370 --> 01:14:44,870
Yeah, yeah.

1908
01:14:46,710 --> 01:14:48,230
Are they the team that...

1909
01:14:48,230 --> 01:14:50,910
Imagine they went against a better EU team.

1910
01:14:53,090 --> 01:14:53,690
No.

1911
01:14:54,770 --> 01:14:55,590
Who's winning?

1912
01:14:56,310 --> 01:14:58,730
What if they're actually beasts on 100 ping?

1913
01:14:59,510 --> 01:15:00,430
Which one?

1914
01:15:00,630 --> 01:15:01,390
The NA team?

1915
01:15:01,830 --> 01:15:03,870
No, the three ping guys.

1916
01:15:03,870 --> 01:15:05,650
What if they're like, oh, this is weird.

1917
01:15:08,970 --> 01:15:10,170
I'm literally...

1918
01:15:10,810 --> 01:15:12,150
Oh my god.

1919
01:15:12,530 --> 01:15:13,670
That's crazy.

1920
01:15:13,810 --> 01:15:14,070
Okay.

1921
01:15:15,410 --> 01:15:16,170
Oh, no.

1922
01:15:16,370 --> 01:15:20,670
The AU team is beating the other team that they're playing against.

1923
01:15:21,890 --> 01:15:22,910
Are they also American?

1924
01:15:23,950 --> 01:15:26,910
I'm gonna look up the fucking Wikipedia right now.

1925
01:15:27,730 --> 01:15:30,170
It says that's country flags next to...

1926
01:15:30,550 --> 01:15:31,150
Okay.

1927
01:15:31,850 --> 01:15:32,750
Oh, they are EU?

1928
01:15:32,910 --> 01:15:33,750
No, they are EU.

1929
01:15:33,930 --> 01:15:35,090
So they can't even blame ping.

1930
01:15:35,290 --> 01:15:36,850
It's like their own skill diff.

1931
01:15:38,750 --> 01:15:40,250
Maybe they're on American ping now.

1932
01:15:41,550 --> 01:15:44,870
They have the country flags.

1933
01:15:45,830 --> 01:15:47,130
The country flags.

1934
01:15:47,570 --> 01:15:49,230
That's next to their names.

1935
01:15:49,350 --> 01:15:55,910
One is from UK and one is from Poland and then the others don't have the flags but I assume they're also EU.

1936
01:15:57,650 --> 01:15:59,090
So we had excuses.

1937
01:16:00,610 --> 01:16:01,010
True.

1938
01:16:01,970 --> 01:16:04,770
So if we win this next game, how many more games do we play today?

1939
01:16:05,510 --> 01:16:08,510
And then it'll be immediately the last game.

1940
01:16:09,150 --> 01:16:10,690
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1941
01:16:10,990 --> 01:16:12,530
So at most, two more games.

1942
01:16:13,430 --> 01:16:16,770
This is feeling like a TFT, Tony, with the time in between games, bro.

1943
01:16:18,070 --> 01:16:20,710
I never played TFT so I don't know that reference.

1944
01:16:21,970 --> 01:16:22,170
Oh.

1945
01:16:24,550 --> 01:16:25,890
Yeah, no one plays TFT, right?

1946
01:16:25,890 --> 01:16:26,530
Yeah, yeah.

1947
01:16:26,530 --> 01:16:27,910
My bad, my bad.

1948
01:16:27,970 --> 01:16:31,010
You gotta be more with the times.

1949
01:16:31,410 --> 01:16:31,850
It's not a TFT anymore.

1950
01:16:31,850 --> 01:16:32,590
It's like Among Us.

1951
01:16:32,690 --> 01:16:34,870
There's like a giant emergency meeting in between the games.

1952
01:16:35,810 --> 01:16:37,430
Oh, that's...

1953
01:16:37,430 --> 01:16:39,290
No, that's still not relevant.

1954
01:16:40,510 --> 01:16:41,290
It's like...

1955
01:16:41,290 --> 01:16:43,330
It's lockdown protocol now.

1956
01:16:43,610 --> 01:16:43,990
Lockdown protocol.

1957
01:16:45,670 --> 01:16:52,070
It's lockdown protocol and we all gathered around in the main lobby.

1958
01:16:55,350 --> 01:16:55,910
Yeah.

1959
01:17:01,530 --> 01:17:03,050
Can't even relate.

1960
01:17:03,570 --> 01:17:05,830
An unrelatable streamer.

1961
01:17:06,730 --> 01:17:07,570
Who can relate?

1962
01:17:07,670 --> 01:17:07,990
Very usual.

1963
01:17:12,650 --> 01:17:14,410
Alright, let's see.

1964
01:17:16,450 --> 01:17:17,530
New message.

1965
01:17:17,910 --> 01:17:18,010
Alright.

1966
01:17:18,390 --> 01:17:21,050
I love that Rae just gets called old in cold blood.

1967
01:17:21,190 --> 01:17:22,930
What are you doing to them, Ramblin?

1968
01:17:22,930 --> 01:17:24,830
I'm rescuing them.

1969
01:17:25,030 --> 01:17:27,110
Rae looked at the donation.

1970
01:17:29,850 --> 01:17:30,930
Oh yeah, I saw that.

1971
01:17:31,330 --> 01:17:34,010
RIP Raeditz, your flip into the hurricane was epic.

1972
01:17:34,790 --> 01:17:37,290
I'm literally doing tricks on it.

1973
01:17:37,870 --> 01:17:38,890
Right now.

1974
01:17:39,190 --> 01:17:40,910
You brought your setup outside.

1975
01:17:42,650 --> 01:17:44,170
It's like he's in the rain.

1976
01:17:45,270 --> 01:17:46,550
Doing a McTwist.

1977
01:17:46,730 --> 01:17:47,810
He's like, what a...

1978
01:17:48,670 --> 01:17:49,270
McTwist.

1979
01:17:50,190 --> 01:17:51,350
What is a McTwist?

1980
01:17:52,010 --> 01:17:53,590
You gotta do the McTwist over the helicopter.

1981
01:17:53,870 --> 01:17:59,490
When Rae died like 10 times, he was in the center of that hurricane right there.

1982
01:18:03,430 --> 01:18:04,990
Isn't the eye the worst place to be?

1983
01:18:05,430 --> 01:18:06,670
No, it's the best place to be.

1984
01:18:06,990 --> 01:18:09,970
It's the best place to be because it's where nothing happens in the center.

1985
01:18:10,770 --> 01:18:13,670
Not really though, because it's going to move and then you're going to be in the...

1986
01:18:13,670 --> 01:18:15,670
You have to continuously move with the eye.

1987
01:18:15,670 --> 01:18:20,110
Because I don't know if you guys know this, but hurricanes move a lot.

1988
01:18:21,450 --> 01:18:25,950
No, as a Californian, this is the most foreign concept to me of all time.

1989
01:18:26,530 --> 01:18:29,150
If the ground starts shaking, I got you covered.

1990
01:18:29,510 --> 01:18:32,370
Oh my god, so much chat was like, wow, natural PC cooling?

1991
01:18:32,710 --> 01:18:33,070
Wow.

1992
01:18:33,790 --> 01:18:34,610
Oh, that's true.

1993
01:18:34,670 --> 01:18:37,070
Yeah, you got that PC cooling in the hurricane.

1994
01:18:37,690 --> 01:18:38,670
You got the water cooling.

1995
01:18:40,510 --> 01:18:41,910
I hate water cooling.

1996
01:18:42,330 --> 01:18:44,890
I don't know if anybody else hates water cooling.

1997
01:18:44,990 --> 01:18:46,450
That shit always explodes on me.

1998
01:18:47,590 --> 01:18:48,450
I'm a hater.

1999
01:18:48,630 --> 01:18:49,890
You just stick a big ass fan in there.

2000
01:18:51,290 --> 01:18:53,450
Like the radiator always dies or like...

2001
01:18:53,450 --> 01:18:55,510
I don't think that's supposed to happen.

2002
01:18:56,130 --> 01:18:57,850
I don't think that's common.

2003
01:18:58,190 --> 01:19:01,770
Do you just use water cooling or do you do lava cooling as well to make obsidian?

2004
01:19:02,370 --> 01:19:03,270
Lava cooling?

2005
01:19:03,310 --> 01:19:04,650
I gotta get in on that one.

2006
01:19:06,030 --> 01:19:07,730
Lava cooling sounds like...

2007
01:19:09,510 --> 01:19:10,650
I gotta get in on that.

2008
01:19:10,650 --> 01:19:13,670
Oh, I saw like a PC where you can get Mountain Dew cooling.

2009
01:19:14,470 --> 01:19:15,730
Can I ban McGuinness?

2010
01:19:16,630 --> 01:19:17,110
Oh, we're banning?

2011
01:19:17,250 --> 01:19:17,870
We're picking a banner?

2012
01:19:18,270 --> 01:19:20,310
Yeah, what do we not play?

2013
01:19:22,270 --> 01:19:23,430
I can ban McGuinness.

2014
01:19:23,650 --> 01:19:25,530
Do you want me to...

2015
01:19:25,530 --> 01:19:29,470
I can request an A server and be like...

2016
01:19:29,470 --> 01:19:32,050
What specific server do we want to play on?

2017
01:19:32,890 --> 01:19:34,050
Sounds like most of you guys are west.

2018
01:19:35,830 --> 01:19:37,070
Just put England.

2019
01:19:41,550 --> 01:19:43,210
I ban McGuinness already.

2020
01:19:48,410 --> 01:19:50,750
We should play...

2021
01:19:50,750 --> 01:19:52,570
We should get Abrams for Doki.

2022
01:19:52,890 --> 01:19:53,510
Do we get two picks?

2023
01:19:54,750 --> 01:19:55,790
I don't know.

2024
01:19:56,570 --> 01:19:58,670
Can we get Viscous so I can play anything else?

2025
01:19:59,650 --> 01:20:01,630
We can go Abrams, Viscous.

2026
01:20:02,270 --> 01:20:03,970
I literally just learned Haze.

2027
01:20:04,310 --> 01:20:05,790
Oh my god, time to go back to Abrams.

2028
01:20:05,850 --> 01:20:06,630
Let's fucking go.

2029
01:20:06,830 --> 01:20:07,470
Let's go.

2030
01:20:10,890 --> 01:20:11,870
Let's fucking go.

2031
01:20:12,250 --> 01:20:13,530
Abrams, buy the magic carpet.

2032
01:20:16,290 --> 01:20:18,450
What does that even look like?

2033
01:20:18,870 --> 01:20:19,050
Wait.

2034
01:20:19,870 --> 01:20:20,790
For Abrams.

2035
01:20:20,950 --> 01:20:24,290
I don't know if I meant like for Abrams.

2036
01:20:24,390 --> 01:20:28,390
Oh my god, imagine Abrams up in the sky and then he does the number four.

2037
01:20:30,670 --> 01:20:32,090
Bro, that shit would be sick.

2038
01:20:32,110 --> 01:20:32,730
The number four.

2039
01:20:32,730 --> 01:20:35,350
I think there used to be even a melee on the carpet.

2040
01:20:36,070 --> 01:20:37,570
Wait, can you still do it?

2041
01:20:38,090 --> 01:20:38,750
I don't think so.

2042
01:20:38,750 --> 01:20:39,530
That was a Yamato build.

2043
01:20:40,730 --> 01:20:42,490
Yeah, I can't do it.

2044
01:20:42,610 --> 01:20:43,990
Whenever I try it, I fall off.

2045
01:20:44,470 --> 01:20:45,690
So you just do like drive-by backstops.

2046
01:20:45,950 --> 01:20:48,870
So like, okay, get over here, Mirage.

2047
01:20:49,170 --> 01:20:50,730
We're going to have a magic carpet fight.

2048
01:20:52,490 --> 01:20:53,810
What are we locking now?

2049
01:20:57,130 --> 01:20:58,550
I think I void pocket now.

2050
01:20:58,550 --> 01:20:59,390
Okay, pocket.

2051
01:21:00,370 --> 01:21:00,850
Pocket.

2052
01:21:03,610 --> 01:21:06,370
You can last pick it.

2053
01:21:07,210 --> 01:21:08,430
Probably, they won't take it.

2054
01:21:08,810 --> 01:21:10,250
Okay, what about you?

2055
01:21:11,690 --> 01:21:14,650
I can play...

2056
01:21:14,650 --> 01:21:15,250
Infernus, Shiv.

2057
01:21:16,570 --> 01:21:17,750
They won't play Infernus.

2058
01:21:18,070 --> 01:21:20,550
I can play Shiv or...

2059
01:21:21,990 --> 01:21:23,710
I'm thinking who's good for our team here.

2060
01:21:24,230 --> 01:21:25,870
Wait, what server are we requesting to?

2061
01:21:25,870 --> 01:21:27,530
Like, specific server.

2062
01:21:28,310 --> 01:21:29,250
What are our options?

2063
01:21:29,730 --> 01:21:30,530
I don't know.

2064
01:21:33,150 --> 01:21:36,390
I'm assuming there's West, Central, and East.

2065
01:21:36,530 --> 01:21:37,310
So we want Shiv then?

2066
01:21:37,650 --> 01:21:38,610
I'll just lock in Shiv.

2067
01:21:41,790 --> 01:21:44,470
We want West, Coast, Central, or East.

2068
01:21:45,550 --> 01:21:47,270
Five of us are West Coast.

2069
01:21:49,410 --> 01:21:50,930
Me and Ray are both East Coast.

2070
01:21:50,930 --> 01:21:53,370
Can we request West Coast server?

2071
01:21:55,870 --> 01:21:58,430
And if anything, East Coast server.

2072
01:21:58,650 --> 01:21:59,010
Central.

2073
01:22:01,570 --> 01:22:03,550
We deserve to know what it feels like.

2074
01:22:08,210 --> 01:22:08,770
Bebop!

2075
01:22:10,210 --> 01:22:11,250
No way.

2076
01:22:11,410 --> 01:22:12,990
They bebop this?

2077
01:22:13,490 --> 01:22:14,490
They're playing bebop?

2078
01:22:14,770 --> 01:22:15,430
Oh no.

2079
01:22:16,170 --> 01:22:16,950
That's Yuumi's enemy.

2080
01:22:17,470 --> 01:22:18,530
I want Bibimbap now.

2081
01:22:18,890 --> 01:22:19,830
Yeah, give me Talon.

2082
01:22:20,510 --> 01:22:22,330
Okay, this is what we've locked in.

2083
01:22:22,330 --> 01:22:23,010
You know what?

2084
01:22:23,070 --> 01:22:25,230
I'm happy as long as we don't go against McGuinness.

2085
01:22:26,030 --> 01:22:26,490
True.

2086
01:22:27,810 --> 01:22:29,870
I'm happy because you guys can finally parry.

2087
01:22:35,890 --> 01:22:36,350
Guys,

2088
01:22:40,530 --> 01:22:41,770
don't do that to me.

2089
01:22:42,630 --> 01:22:42,990
Sorry.

2090
01:22:47,090 --> 01:22:51,170
I just did it subconsciously.

2091
01:22:53,430 --> 01:22:54,590
I'm going to use the bathroom.

2092
01:22:57,170 --> 01:22:59,870
I guess I also have to use the bathroom.

2093
01:23:00,110 --> 01:23:01,550
I'm going to pee in Void's bathroom.

2094
01:23:02,350 --> 01:23:03,930
Hey guys, I'm going to be here.

2095
01:23:05,310 --> 01:23:05,770
Oh, me too.

2096
01:23:05,810 --> 01:23:06,650
I actually don't need to go.

2097
01:23:06,650 --> 01:23:07,230
Oh, okay.

2098
01:23:09,010 --> 01:23:11,410
I just wanted to be included.

2099
01:23:12,010 --> 01:23:13,930
Are you going to be included in the bathroom?

2100
01:23:14,390 --> 01:23:14,910
Yeah.

2101
01:23:15,410 --> 01:23:16,410
In the bathroom party?

2102
01:23:17,070 --> 01:23:18,450
And then leave our chat alone?

2103
01:23:19,330 --> 01:23:19,690
Empty?

2104
01:23:20,210 --> 01:23:21,090
With no entertainment?

2105
01:23:21,830 --> 01:23:28,390
Because I was going to say, people in other people's chats, I'd never leave you guys to go to the bathroom.

2106
01:23:28,750 --> 01:23:29,930
That's what I was going to say.

2107
01:23:31,130 --> 01:23:34,470
I would like to co-sign that I would also never leave.

2108
01:23:34,470 --> 01:23:36,550
Yeah, so like, we care.

2109
01:23:38,630 --> 01:23:39,950
That's the difference.

2110
01:23:40,450 --> 01:23:42,510
My stream chat...

2111
01:23:46,630 --> 01:23:51,710
My chat, all they talk about is that your laugh makes them laugh.

2112
01:23:52,130 --> 01:23:53,150
Oh shit, really?

2113
01:23:53,410 --> 01:24:00,890
Guys, instead of listening second hand at Sejam's stream, you can head over on YouTube and check me out.

2114
01:24:01,310 --> 01:24:02,110
It's Doki Bird.

2115
01:24:06,570 --> 01:24:13,830
But if you guys want to listen to a second hand to my chat, you can head over to Sejam's stream, which is on Twitch.

2116
01:24:13,850 --> 01:24:16,630
And that's why I can co-sign that Doki is awesome.

2117
01:24:16,910 --> 01:24:17,590
Yeah, see?

2118
01:24:18,350 --> 01:24:19,330
But you can leave everybody else.

2119
01:24:19,410 --> 01:24:25,910
If you're in all the other people's chats who left you for the bathroom, you should come to our streams, because we wouldn't leave you.

2120
01:24:27,650 --> 01:24:28,290
Hey, Goomy.

2121
01:24:29,350 --> 01:24:30,090
What happened?

2122
01:24:30,210 --> 01:24:30,950
I was peeing.

2123
01:24:31,690 --> 01:24:32,270
Oh, there was nothing.

2124
01:24:32,270 --> 01:24:32,790
We just left.

2125
01:24:34,850 --> 01:24:35,110
Yeah.

2126
01:24:35,490 --> 01:24:37,230
I have a wireless headphone.

2127
01:24:37,670 --> 01:24:38,490
Yeah, same.

2128
01:24:39,910 --> 01:24:41,910
What did we say?

2129
01:24:42,150 --> 01:24:43,170
We were talking.

2130
01:24:43,510 --> 01:24:46,930
If anyone wants to listen to me not second hand, hop over on YouTube.

2131
01:24:47,870 --> 01:24:54,910
And I was like, no, also hop over to Sejam's stream and everybody else who's playing in this tournament.

2132
01:24:54,930 --> 01:24:56,470
I wouldn't leave you guys alone, chat.

2133
01:24:56,610 --> 01:24:57,910
I wouldn't go pee.

2134
01:24:57,910 --> 01:25:00,630
She said she'd sell your body for drugs.

2135
01:25:00,850 --> 01:25:02,710
I'd take my chat to the bathroom with me.

2136
01:25:03,250 --> 01:25:04,310
Wait, you took your chat?

2137
01:25:04,450 --> 01:25:07,390
Wait, you actually talked to your chat while you were in your bathroom?

2138
01:25:08,370 --> 01:25:09,570
No, I have a camera and everything, yeah.

2139
01:25:09,830 --> 01:25:10,450
Oh, shit.

2140
01:25:11,610 --> 01:25:12,810
Are you lying?

2141
01:25:13,850 --> 01:25:16,170
No, I have a GoPro on mine.

2142
01:25:17,570 --> 01:25:18,230
Isn't that bannable?

2143
01:25:18,230 --> 01:25:19,070
Where is the GoPro on?

2144
01:25:19,510 --> 01:25:21,010
Yeah, where is it on?

2145
01:25:24,050 --> 01:25:26,830
Also, isn't that a bannable offense on Twitch?

2146
01:25:31,270 --> 01:25:33,050
Wasn't there like a really tall guy who did that?

2147
01:25:33,130 --> 01:25:37,150
Yeah, wasn't there one guy that did that once where they went to a bathroom and got banned?

2148
01:25:37,310 --> 01:25:38,450
Didn't that happen before?

2149
01:25:38,690 --> 01:25:40,570
Oh, like streaming in the bathroom, right?

2150
01:25:41,070 --> 01:25:41,470
Yeah.

2151
01:25:44,450 --> 01:25:46,410
I think that guy's also a doctor.

2152
01:25:47,110 --> 01:25:47,870
Oh, he's a doctor?

2153
01:25:48,290 --> 01:25:49,310
He has an MD?

2154
01:25:50,170 --> 01:25:50,910
An MD, yeah.

2155
01:25:51,030 --> 01:25:56,830
I was at TwitchCon this year and I was wearing a microphone and I took it off and I was like, we don't want any recording in the bathroom, right guys?

2156
01:25:56,910 --> 01:25:58,230
And Twitch did not laugh.

2157
01:26:07,430 --> 01:26:10,310
At least we can laugh with you.

2158
01:26:10,910 --> 01:26:14,010
They didn't laugh, you just see them look down and write something on a piece of paper.

2159
01:26:16,050 --> 01:26:19,730
Guys, when there's no slam at next year's TwitchCon, we know why.

2160
01:26:20,170 --> 01:26:21,490
We know why they did it.

2161
01:26:21,590 --> 01:26:23,210
So here's the code, guys.

2162
01:26:24,090 --> 01:26:24,490
Nice.

2163
01:26:24,810 --> 01:26:26,790
Alright, here we go.

2164
01:26:26,810 --> 01:26:28,270
We're not showing it on stream, right, everybody?

2165
01:26:28,370 --> 01:26:29,570
No, of course not.

2166
01:26:29,730 --> 01:26:30,550
You guys would never do that?

2167
01:26:30,710 --> 01:26:33,850
No, that's why I'm the first one in here.

2168
01:26:35,810 --> 01:26:38,270
Well, I didn't want to leave all of you because, you know.

2169
01:26:38,570 --> 01:26:40,190
Why are they all Warden?

2170
01:26:41,570 --> 01:26:41,790
What?

2171
01:26:41,830 --> 01:26:42,610
It's like a puzzle.

2172
01:26:44,510 --> 01:26:46,230
Who do I join with?

2173
01:26:47,090 --> 01:26:49,550
Uh, Ducky's Abrams.

2174
01:26:49,830 --> 01:26:51,250
Wait, why are they all Warden?

2175
01:26:51,310 --> 01:26:52,110
That's terrifying.

2176
01:26:52,430 --> 01:26:53,170
I'm scared.

2177
01:26:53,830 --> 01:26:55,770
Why are they so coordinated?

2178
01:26:56,050 --> 01:26:57,630
Wait, two of them are connected.

2179
01:26:57,910 --> 01:26:59,070
It's like the hat and the body.

2180
01:26:59,250 --> 01:26:59,850
Do you see that?

2181
01:26:59,930 --> 01:27:00,450
In order.

2182
01:27:00,870 --> 01:27:02,310
Oh my god.

2183
01:27:02,570 --> 01:27:06,270
Oh, they're trying to do it in order, so it...

2184
01:27:06,270 --> 01:27:07,730
I'm messing it up, I'm messing it up.

2185
01:27:10,750 --> 01:27:13,390
Yeah, you guys were being coordinated.

2186
01:27:13,390 --> 01:27:14,510
You're in the bottom.

2187
01:27:15,810 --> 01:27:16,990
Yeah, look at that.

2188
01:27:17,290 --> 01:27:18,550
Yeah, that's icky, right?

2189
01:27:19,350 --> 01:27:21,490
You guys were trying to be coordinated.

2190
01:27:23,430 --> 01:27:25,010
Wait, let them do it and I give you the feet.

2191
01:27:25,110 --> 01:27:25,770
Okay, okay.

2192
01:27:27,850 --> 01:27:30,550
Okay, we need him to move up and go, Ray, go!

2193
01:27:31,130 --> 01:27:31,290
Yeah!

2194
01:27:34,190 --> 01:27:35,630
Wait, that is sick.

2195
01:27:36,310 --> 01:27:37,510
You have the feet at the bottom.

2196
01:27:38,250 --> 01:27:40,250
Look at this guy's mustache over here, pissed.

2197
01:27:40,330 --> 01:27:41,670
He's so mad he can't get up.

2198
01:27:41,670 --> 01:27:43,410
Bro, they were practicing their whole...

2199
01:27:43,410 --> 01:27:47,710
Yeah, so much that they were practicing their whole lives for this moment and we ruined it in one second.

2200
01:27:48,630 --> 01:27:50,770
They couldn't even get it going.

2201
01:27:51,870 --> 01:27:53,290
Okay, what lane am I going?

2202
01:27:53,590 --> 01:27:54,690
Am I staying back in green?

2203
01:27:55,690 --> 01:27:57,560
I don't know.

2204
01:27:59,940 --> 01:28:01,060
I'm chill with whatever.

2205
01:28:01,600 --> 01:28:03,280
Do you want to send...

2206
01:28:03,280 --> 01:28:05,720
Do you want to play in a lane that's not a side lane board?

2207
01:28:08,540 --> 01:28:08,980
Um...

2208
01:28:08,980 --> 01:28:13,740
Low-key, yeah, but I'm also chill with a side lane too.

2209
01:28:13,840 --> 01:28:14,460
What's happening?

2210
01:28:15,840 --> 01:28:19,240
If I'm in one of the other lanes, I do like roaming a lot.

2211
01:28:19,320 --> 01:28:22,600
Yeah, I was going to say, you have a little bit more agency if you're not in a side lane.

2212
01:28:23,020 --> 01:28:23,400
Yeah.

2213
01:28:23,740 --> 01:28:24,460
I can lane with Doki.

2214
01:28:24,980 --> 01:28:25,340
Alright.

2215
01:28:26,220 --> 01:28:28,200
I need somebody to babysit me.

2216
01:28:29,040 --> 01:28:29,560
I got you.

2217
01:28:30,340 --> 01:28:32,100
Great Talon solo lane.

2218
01:28:32,360 --> 01:28:32,720
Alright.

2219
01:28:35,820 --> 01:28:37,640
I like how they were like, Hey guys.

2220
01:28:37,640 --> 01:28:38,720
Two moustaches.

2221
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:41,600
Yeah, they look a little...

2222
01:28:41,600 --> 01:28:45,180
Wait, let them choose their characters first.

2223
01:28:45,700 --> 01:28:47,680
Oh, well they know what I'm doing now.

2224
01:28:49,140 --> 01:28:49,660
Well...

2225
01:28:51,180 --> 01:28:52,200
Sorry guys.

2226
01:28:52,400 --> 01:28:54,100
I sort of messed up a little.

2227
01:28:54,140 --> 01:28:56,120
Wait, none of them even picked Warden.

2228
01:28:56,260 --> 01:28:57,380
Yeah, they're wild picks.

2229
01:28:58,400 --> 01:29:00,740
That's literally the only profile picture they had.

2230
01:29:01,480 --> 01:29:02,460
You guys are disgusting.

2231
01:29:03,480 --> 01:29:05,600
So we're against Infernus Wraith.

2232
01:29:06,980 --> 01:29:08,640
Bebop is next to us.

2233
01:29:09,180 --> 01:29:10,920
Yeah, but we can always...

2234
01:29:10,920 --> 01:29:12,060
Do we have to go to these lanes?

2235
01:29:12,520 --> 01:29:15,220
We can swap lanes right now.

2236
01:29:15,880 --> 01:29:17,380
Well, we can also swap in game now.

2237
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:18,860
Yeah, that's true.

2238
01:29:19,660 --> 01:29:20,380
That is true.

2239
01:29:20,980 --> 01:29:21,700
Dynamo hate.

2240
01:29:22,400 --> 01:29:24,140
Their solo lanes are really strong.

2241
01:29:24,320 --> 01:29:26,140
I don't know, Ray, because you...

2242
01:29:26,140 --> 01:29:29,300
I was going to say, I don't know how you do against Mo and Krill.

2243
01:29:30,140 --> 01:29:31,580
But Bebop is probably worse for you, right?

2244
01:29:32,360 --> 01:29:32,820
Yeah, yeah.

2245
01:29:32,820 --> 01:29:34,860
I feel like I could do decently against Mo.

2246
01:29:35,400 --> 01:29:38,300
Are we happy about these formations, everyone?

2247
01:29:38,440 --> 01:29:39,660
Do we want to swap anything around?

2248
01:29:39,860 --> 01:29:40,440
Do we care?

2249
01:29:40,840 --> 01:29:46,120
The only thing I was going to say is, do we want to send Pocket or Viscous into the solo lane against Bebop?

2250
01:29:47,240 --> 01:29:48,780
I love fighting Bebop.

2251
01:29:49,420 --> 01:29:51,280
Okay, we can swap Sage and Min.

2252
01:29:51,980 --> 01:29:53,080
I think that's a good idea.

2253
01:29:54,840 --> 01:29:59,140
Okay, I'm just going to ready up here, and then we're going to swap in game.

2254
01:29:59,140 --> 01:30:00,340
All right.

2255
01:30:01,100 --> 01:30:02,500
They won't expect it.

2256
01:30:03,260 --> 01:30:03,740
Yeah.

2257
01:30:04,240 --> 01:30:08,540
Yeah, they're not going to have our streams turn up to see what we're talking about.

2258
01:30:08,640 --> 01:30:09,540
A charity tournament?

2259
01:30:09,740 --> 01:30:11,060
Yeah, a charity for the kids?

2260
01:30:13,660 --> 01:30:18,800
Are they really going to sabotage the children for the sake of winning?

2261
01:30:19,180 --> 01:30:19,820
That's true.

2262
01:30:20,560 --> 01:30:22,220
Anyway, so whose streams do you guys have open?

2263
01:30:23,620 --> 01:30:24,980
We just open up all those streams.

2264
01:30:24,980 --> 01:30:28,360
Yeah, we just open all the streams right now while we're talking about it.

2265
01:30:29,520 --> 01:30:31,100
I'm watching Warden's mustache.

2266
01:30:31,220 --> 01:30:32,640
Okay, so like the Haze, right?

2267
01:30:32,880 --> 01:30:36,620
They're just saying that the Haze is going to start flanking the blue lane.

2268
01:30:39,060 --> 01:30:41,180
I'm actually a three-year sub to Warden's hat.

2269
01:30:42,140 --> 01:30:42,760
Oh, shit!

2270
01:30:43,800 --> 01:30:45,700
I bet you're not even a tier 3 sub.

2271
01:30:46,520 --> 01:30:47,240
You got me.

2272
01:30:47,400 --> 01:30:48,280
I knew it.

2273
01:30:48,600 --> 01:30:51,020
Because I'm the tier 3 sub, and I never saw you there.

2274
01:30:51,020 --> 01:30:51,760
I'm only a tier 2.

2275
01:30:52,840 --> 01:30:54,180
Is there a tier 3 club?

2276
01:30:54,280 --> 01:30:54,940
I didn't know.

2277
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:56,480
Damn.

2278
01:30:57,020 --> 01:30:58,120
Yeah, I'm in a tier 3 club.

2279
01:30:58,200 --> 01:30:59,000
That's fucking right.

2280
01:30:59,580 --> 01:31:00,060
Damn.

2281
01:31:00,560 --> 01:31:01,540
Yeah, you fake fan.

2282
01:31:02,960 --> 01:31:04,700
Have you guys ever tier 3 subbed anybody?

2283
01:31:05,680 --> 01:31:05,860
Nope.

2284
01:31:06,640 --> 01:31:08,560
I've never even tier 2 subbed anyone.

2285
01:31:08,800 --> 01:31:09,860
I'm a tier 3 sub to Rambo.

2286
01:31:10,360 --> 01:31:12,280
I think I tier 3 subbed once.

2287
01:31:12,800 --> 01:31:13,500
One whole time.

2288
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,000
I did it once, but it was for feet pics.

2289
01:31:16,240 --> 01:31:17,280
I don't think that counts.

2290
01:31:17,960 --> 01:31:20,360
Are we good to start the match?

2291
01:31:20,740 --> 01:31:21,820
I assume we are.

2292
01:31:23,140 --> 01:31:24,500
Whose pics were they?

2293
01:31:24,920 --> 01:31:26,000
Guys, I'll be honest.

2294
01:31:27,240 --> 01:31:30,240
I don't know what server we're on, but I chose West.

2295
01:31:30,360 --> 01:31:30,920
It looks like West.

2296
01:31:32,440 --> 01:31:33,780
I clicked in West.

2297
01:31:34,140 --> 01:31:34,880
It's over.

2298
01:31:35,240 --> 01:31:35,920
Oh my god.

2299
01:31:36,180 --> 01:31:37,060
It's fucking over.

2300
01:31:37,920 --> 01:31:38,140
Alright.

2301
01:31:39,180 --> 01:31:40,800
Okay, Blaine and...

2302
01:31:41,540 --> 01:31:42,020
Okay.

2303
01:31:43,620 --> 01:31:44,440
Oh my god.

2304
01:31:45,020 --> 01:31:46,820
I'm not going in and out of Ramblin.

2305
01:31:46,920 --> 01:31:48,460
I'm not going in and out of Ramblin.

2306
01:31:48,460 --> 01:31:49,140
Oh my god.

2307
01:31:49,360 --> 01:31:51,060
My character is okay.

2308
01:31:52,480 --> 01:31:54,400
Wait, no way.

2309
01:31:54,480 --> 01:31:55,600
Ramblin said good luck.

2310
01:32:00,580 --> 01:32:01,980
Good luck.

2311
01:32:04,180 --> 01:32:04,940
I'm sorry.

2312
01:32:06,280 --> 01:32:07,580
Yeah, they didn't swap.

2313
01:32:09,420 --> 01:32:10,000
Oh my god.

2314
01:32:10,080 --> 01:32:11,020
I can actually...

2315
01:32:11,020 --> 01:32:14,880
I can actually hit the orbs.

2316
01:32:15,320 --> 01:32:16,620
That's crazy.

2317
01:32:16,620 --> 01:32:16,700
That's crazy.

2318
01:32:16,920 --> 01:32:17,720
Holy shit.

2319
01:32:17,740 --> 01:32:19,260
I've never...

2320
01:32:19,260 --> 01:32:23,660
I can actually deny them.

2321
01:32:23,840 --> 01:32:24,720
Oh my god.

2322
01:32:24,800 --> 01:32:28,180
What is this beautiful landscape I've encountered?

2323
01:32:35,580 --> 01:32:37,400
This is so crazy.

2324
01:32:38,300 --> 01:32:40,080
I don't know how to feel about it.

2325
01:32:41,160 --> 01:32:42,740
Yeah, now that I have EU citizenship.

2326
01:32:43,040 --> 01:32:43,700
I don't know what to tell them.

2327
01:32:45,400 --> 01:32:46,740
Now that we're EU gamers.

2328
01:32:47,120 --> 01:32:48,320
I'm going to buy real fast.

2329
01:32:49,180 --> 01:32:49,720
Me too.

2330
01:32:49,940 --> 01:32:51,520
Now that we speak their language.

2331
01:32:52,300 --> 01:32:53,060
I know.

2332
01:32:53,200 --> 01:32:55,480
Now that Sejuan learned fucking Swedish.

2333
01:32:55,640 --> 01:32:56,820
Like, what the fuck is he going to do now?

2334
01:32:57,200 --> 01:32:58,560
Yeah, what are they going to do about me now?

2335
01:32:59,800 --> 01:33:00,180
Yeah.

2336
01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:02,800
After he burned his American passport.

2337
01:33:03,320 --> 01:33:03,860
Like, point.

2338
01:33:07,060 --> 01:33:08,560
Literally never even heard of America.

2339
01:33:09,400 --> 01:33:10,380
What's with these Americans?

2340
01:33:10,380 --> 01:33:13,480
They call their leagues the world championships.

2341
01:33:13,660 --> 01:33:15,000
And only Americans can play in it.

2342
01:33:15,220 --> 01:33:16,460
You know what I'm saying, guys?

2343
01:33:16,860 --> 01:33:17,400
That's true.

2344
01:33:17,960 --> 01:33:19,320
Now I sound like a real fucking European.

2345
01:33:19,340 --> 01:33:20,880
What the fuck is American football?

2346
01:33:20,980 --> 01:33:22,600
You don't even use your legs.

2347
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:23,260
NA.

2348
01:33:23,700 --> 01:33:24,080
NA.

2349
01:33:24,780 --> 01:33:25,640
NA play.

2350
01:33:26,380 --> 01:33:26,380
NA.

2351
01:33:29,040 --> 01:33:29,920
Land of the free.

2352
01:33:30,040 --> 01:33:30,940
Am I right, guys?

2353
01:33:31,340 --> 01:33:32,140
Oh, I'm going to get punched.

2354
01:33:44,340 --> 01:33:47,580
Oh my god.

2355
01:33:47,700 --> 01:33:47,780
Oh my god.

2356
01:33:47,780 --> 01:33:49,600
It's so weird being able to deny.

2357
01:33:50,060 --> 01:33:52,620
I feel like we're in a hyperbolic time.

2358
01:33:53,060 --> 01:33:53,620
Yeah.

2359
01:33:55,380 --> 01:33:56,780
It's so weird.

2360
01:33:56,860 --> 01:33:58,520
I'm not used to it at all.

2361
01:34:01,220 --> 01:34:01,540
Oh my god.

2362
01:34:01,540 --> 01:34:02,780
I feel like I should be culling my tether.

2363
01:34:02,920 --> 01:34:03,540
I'm going to pull up on him.

2364
01:34:04,500 --> 01:34:04,820
Oh.

2365
01:34:06,800 --> 01:34:07,340
Okay, okay.

2366
01:34:07,520 --> 01:34:08,500
That's got a little bit of damage.

2367
01:34:09,020 --> 01:34:09,980
Oh my god.

2368
01:34:10,560 --> 01:34:11,740
I mean, you have so much regen.

2369
01:34:12,220 --> 01:34:14,780
But I'm having to poke a little bit.

2370
01:34:17,260 --> 01:34:18,260
It's just Mo and Krill.

2371
01:34:18,320 --> 01:34:19,200
What are they going to do?

2372
01:34:19,420 --> 01:34:20,440
Buy Shadow Weave?

2373
01:34:20,960 --> 01:34:22,060
What the fuck is Shadow Weave?

2374
01:34:22,160 --> 01:34:22,680
I got him.

2375
01:34:22,680 --> 01:34:23,060
I got him.

2376
01:34:28,520 --> 01:34:28,620
Bye.

2377
01:34:34,520 --> 01:34:35,760
I need to upgrade.

2378
01:34:35,940 --> 01:34:36,080
Okay.

2379
01:34:37,860 --> 01:34:38,740
Alright, I'm back.

2380
01:34:50,490 --> 01:34:51,010
Oh, okay.

2381
01:34:51,450 --> 01:34:52,350
My bad, my bad.

2382
01:34:55,350 --> 01:34:58,650
Oh, he's in here doing the farm.

2383
01:34:59,630 --> 01:35:00,090
Oh, he is?

2384
01:35:00,150 --> 01:35:00,670
I'm coming over.

2385
01:35:02,270 --> 01:35:03,510
Oh, he left.

2386
01:35:04,970 --> 01:35:06,210
Okay, right idea though.

2387
01:35:07,010 --> 01:35:07,450
Yep.

2388
01:35:08,110 --> 01:35:10,290
I'm coming back to you.

2389
01:35:11,530 --> 01:35:12,590
Oh, I'm stuck.

2390
01:35:13,730 --> 01:35:14,610
Oh, goodbye.

2391
01:35:16,010 --> 01:35:17,010
He's low though.

2392
01:35:17,250 --> 01:35:17,810
He's one.

2393
01:35:17,930 --> 01:35:18,090
He's one.

2394
01:35:18,170 --> 01:35:18,390
He's one.

2395
01:35:18,730 --> 01:35:19,030
Nice.

2396
01:35:19,910 --> 01:35:20,530
She's one too.

2397
01:35:22,810 --> 01:35:23,530
I got her.

2398
01:35:25,550 --> 01:35:26,910
I'm fucking backing out.

2399
01:35:27,510 --> 01:35:30,730
Oh my god, this is what it's like to play the game at an actual level.

2400
01:35:33,770 --> 01:35:34,530
I'm buying.

2401
01:35:34,690 --> 01:35:35,110
I'm going to buy.

2402
01:35:35,730 --> 01:35:37,310
Yeah, I'm going to shove this in.

2403
01:35:37,890 --> 01:35:39,030
I believe in you.

2404
01:35:39,110 --> 01:35:39,790
I kill our camps.

2405
01:35:41,190 --> 01:35:42,510
It's brutal out there, huh?

2406
01:35:42,790 --> 01:35:44,630
I'll come by.

2407
01:35:45,150 --> 01:35:46,190
He's going green.

2408
01:35:47,110 --> 01:35:48,150
I'm here now.

2409
01:35:48,850 --> 01:35:49,990
We can back it up then.

2410
01:35:50,350 --> 01:35:50,850
Okay.

2411
01:35:52,350 --> 01:35:53,490
Let me shop real quick.

2412
01:35:54,710 --> 01:35:55,610
I don't know.

2413
01:35:56,790 --> 01:35:58,070
What are you going to do?

2414
01:35:58,130 --> 01:35:58,810
Kill us?

2415
01:35:58,810 --> 01:36:00,810
I'm staying.

2416
01:36:04,910 --> 01:36:05,870
I'm tethered.

2417
01:36:09,040 --> 01:36:09,520
Whoa.

2418
01:36:10,040 --> 01:36:10,520
Here.

2419
01:36:11,380 --> 01:36:11,860
Yeah.

2420
01:36:13,660 --> 01:36:14,320
Work on tower.

2421
01:36:14,780 --> 01:36:16,660
We have ult first too, I'm going to get a little...

2422
01:36:16,660 --> 01:36:16,820
Oh!

2423
01:36:17,240 --> 01:36:18,300
Big man's on top.

2424
01:36:18,420 --> 01:36:22,780
Oh, he's so low!

2425
01:36:23,440 --> 01:36:23,680
Yeah.

2426
01:36:27,210 --> 01:36:28,130
Furnace is one.

2427
01:36:28,290 --> 01:36:29,290
Yeah, I'm going to push up his end.

2428
01:36:29,290 --> 01:36:30,530
Moe's going green again.

2429
01:36:33,470 --> 01:36:34,350
Goodbye, goodbye.

2430
01:36:34,950 --> 01:36:35,510
They're both low.

2431
01:36:35,950 --> 01:36:36,430
Oh, they are?

2432
01:36:36,570 --> 01:36:38,230
Oh, I went back because you said...

2433
01:36:39,830 --> 01:36:42,950
Me and Ramblin do get confused for each other a lot.

2434
01:36:42,970 --> 01:36:44,710
We're literally the same person, so like, undetainable.

2435
01:36:48,970 --> 01:36:49,850
I'm here.

2436
01:36:50,510 --> 01:36:51,610
I'm here with you.

2437
01:36:55,190 --> 01:36:57,450
They might collapse on you also, right?

2438
01:36:58,910 --> 01:37:00,390
I'm gonna come to green.

2439
01:37:05,100 --> 01:37:06,200
I have ult now.

2440
01:37:07,800 --> 01:37:08,660
I'm ulting green.

2441
01:37:09,840 --> 01:37:10,900
Bird coming in green.

2442
01:37:11,300 --> 01:37:12,120
Yeah, we can fight off this.

2443
01:37:13,600 --> 01:37:14,880
I'm coming over here.

2444
01:37:15,420 --> 01:37:16,920
I'm here, I'm here, I'm here.

2445
01:37:17,460 --> 01:37:19,460
Oh, I can't.

2446
01:37:19,480 --> 01:37:20,260
I have the turret on me.

2447
01:37:20,800 --> 01:37:21,280
He's just backing.

2448
01:37:21,700 --> 01:37:23,500
Oh, he was behind us?

2449
01:37:23,560 --> 01:37:23,820
Wow.

2450
01:37:24,260 --> 01:37:24,740
Yeah.

2451
01:37:24,960 --> 01:37:26,240
I didn't see him.

2452
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:28,640
My bad.

2453
01:37:31,740 --> 01:37:32,920
We have a lot of money, too.

2454
01:37:33,260 --> 01:37:34,100
Wait, what the fuck?

2455
01:37:34,580 --> 01:37:35,100
I dived him?

2456
01:37:35,260 --> 01:37:35,620
Oh, nice.

2457
01:37:35,700 --> 01:37:36,000
That's huge.

2458
01:37:36,060 --> 01:37:36,440
No, he's dead.

2459
01:37:37,540 --> 01:37:38,220
Oh, nice.

2460
01:37:39,760 --> 01:37:40,700
I dived him back.

2461
01:37:41,900 --> 01:37:42,740
Oh, they blackballed.

2462
01:37:42,760 --> 01:37:43,800
No, goodbye.

2463
01:37:46,220 --> 01:37:47,880
I can fight him while you run.

2464
01:37:48,380 --> 01:37:48,960
I'll try.

2465
01:37:49,840 --> 01:37:50,640
I got out, I got out.

2466
01:37:51,060 --> 01:37:52,800
Haze is at the end of the tower.

2467
01:37:53,460 --> 01:37:54,560
I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay.

2468
01:37:55,260 --> 01:37:55,920
I'm chilling.

2469
01:37:56,000 --> 01:38:00,580
I'm okay.

2470
01:38:01,940 --> 01:38:03,740
Excuse me, I'm going to be behind the blue lane.

2471
01:38:04,980 --> 01:38:06,620
Oh, one and then five.

2472
01:38:06,920 --> 01:38:07,960
I might need to go back for heals.

2473
01:38:08,240 --> 01:38:08,760
I'm going to go back.

2474
01:38:09,280 --> 01:38:10,840
Can you come in green to poke them a little bit?

2475
01:38:13,040 --> 01:38:13,400
Yay!

2476
01:38:14,380 --> 01:38:14,940
I'm behind them.

2477
01:38:16,680 --> 01:38:18,340
Right there is exactly one HP.

2478
01:38:19,400 --> 01:38:20,720
Yeah, I just helped poke a little bit.

2479
01:38:21,300 --> 01:38:21,740
You guys are.

2480
01:38:23,220 --> 01:38:24,520
I'm coming back now.

2481
01:38:26,380 --> 01:38:27,200
Furnace backed.

2482
01:38:28,700 --> 01:38:29,820
I'm here.

2483
01:38:30,100 --> 01:38:30,780
Creeps responding.

2484
01:38:35,020 --> 01:38:35,740
I'm going to go steal.

2485
01:38:35,740 --> 01:38:36,460
Hello, everybody.

2486
01:38:37,840 --> 01:38:38,720
Abrams is here.

2487
01:38:40,540 --> 01:38:40,900
Welcome.

2488
01:38:46,660 --> 01:38:47,700
I'm coming to green.

2489
01:38:50,440 --> 01:38:51,200
Yeah, I'll pull up.

2490
01:38:51,520 --> 01:38:52,220
I have rage now.

2491
01:38:56,100 --> 01:38:58,360
And Furnace is in my lane now.

2492
01:38:58,360 --> 01:38:59,960
I'm on dynamo.

2493
01:39:03,860 --> 01:39:04,900
Oh, what the fuck?

2494
01:39:04,920 --> 01:39:05,320
Where did he go?

2495
01:39:07,840 --> 01:39:09,060
Where did he go?

2496
01:39:09,640 --> 01:39:11,080
He was in the sky doing his thing.

2497
01:39:12,440 --> 01:39:13,840
I lost track of him.

2498
01:39:15,820 --> 01:39:16,820
I may have trolled.

2499
01:39:17,060 --> 01:39:18,960
I might need a little bit of help.

2500
01:39:20,200 --> 01:39:20,900
Okay, I'm on my way.

2501
01:39:21,080 --> 01:39:23,720
I'm going to just take their farm.

2502
01:39:23,900 --> 01:39:24,760
I'm going to go shop.

2503
01:39:24,760 --> 01:39:26,760
I'll go get the yellow farm.

2504
01:39:26,760 --> 01:39:26,800
Me too.

2505
01:39:26,900 --> 01:39:28,040
I need to shop too.

2506
01:39:29,440 --> 01:39:29,940
I'm here.

2507
01:39:30,140 --> 01:39:30,900
I'm going to be farming yellow as well.

2508
01:39:31,520 --> 01:39:32,640
I'm just going back.

2509
01:39:32,920 --> 01:39:33,660
They left.

2510
01:39:33,760 --> 01:39:35,000
I saw Inferno zipping away.

2511
01:39:35,640 --> 01:39:37,440
Do we help the other lanes or what?

2512
01:39:39,380 --> 01:39:42,340
Yeah, I'm just shoving this in.

2513
01:39:43,020 --> 01:39:44,720
Let's do it real quick and then dip in.

2514
01:39:44,900 --> 01:39:46,740
You can just farm all our jungle in their camps too.

2515
01:39:46,840 --> 01:39:47,460
Alright, yeah.

2516
01:39:48,900 --> 01:39:49,580
I farm.

2517
01:39:50,900 --> 01:39:51,580
Farm time.

2518
01:39:52,260 --> 01:39:52,840
Farm time.

2519
01:39:54,680 --> 01:39:56,640
The waves are always the most money.

2520
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:58,540
So anytime you can catch a wave, you should do that.

2521
01:39:58,680 --> 01:40:00,160
And then in between, get the camps.

2522
01:40:01,400 --> 01:40:02,100
Sweet, I'm learning.

2523
01:40:03,320 --> 01:40:03,920
We love that.

2524
01:40:04,160 --> 01:40:05,200
On top of my head?

2525
01:40:05,420 --> 01:40:06,100
We love learning.

2526
01:40:07,120 --> 01:40:08,760
Not really, but like...

2527
01:40:08,760 --> 01:40:09,380
I'm trying my best.

2528
01:40:16,600 --> 01:40:19,220
I like just reinforcing it and just...

2529
01:40:19,220 --> 01:40:19,940
Oh, Bebop's over here.

2530
01:40:22,600 --> 01:40:24,240
Grab that green wave.

2531
01:40:24,760 --> 01:40:25,980
I got a reload.

2532
01:40:28,400 --> 01:40:29,520
Moe is here too.

2533
01:40:30,320 --> 01:40:30,920
I'm with you.

2534
01:40:31,340 --> 01:40:32,000
I'm coming back.

2535
01:40:36,100 --> 01:40:36,620
Disarmed?

2536
01:40:36,760 --> 01:40:37,200
Oh, nice.

2537
01:40:38,300 --> 01:40:38,820
Exploded.

2538
01:40:42,180 --> 01:40:43,640
I'm coming over.

2539
01:40:43,860 --> 01:40:45,000
There's more farm here.

2540
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:45,740
There's one here.

2541
01:40:47,160 --> 01:40:48,260
I'm going yellow.

2542
01:40:49,420 --> 01:40:50,300
He's bald.

2543
01:40:50,840 --> 01:40:51,660
Oh, hey.

2544
01:40:53,220 --> 01:40:54,820
Are you guys okay over there?

2545
01:40:55,020 --> 01:40:55,540
Need help?

2546
01:40:56,280 --> 01:40:57,320
I stunned him.

2547
01:40:58,860 --> 01:41:00,180
I'm heading over.

2548
01:41:02,120 --> 01:41:03,940
I think Haze is coming over too.

2549
01:41:04,940 --> 01:41:06,300
Oh, there's Moe too.

2550
01:41:06,860 --> 01:41:07,720
We can dive.

2551
01:41:07,840 --> 01:41:09,020
I'm on my way.

2552
01:41:09,020 --> 01:41:09,940
Haze ulted.

2553
01:41:10,180 --> 01:41:12,380
I'm gonna burn.

2554
01:41:12,780 --> 01:41:13,580
Haze ult canceled.

2555
01:41:13,820 --> 01:41:16,960
I need help though.

2556
01:41:18,640 --> 01:41:19,640
Nice burn!

2557
01:41:21,840 --> 01:41:23,380
Please stop!

2558
01:41:25,960 --> 01:41:26,700
Bro!

2559
01:41:27,940 --> 01:41:28,920
Like, stop!

2560
01:41:30,720 --> 01:41:31,800
Yeah, we can just back it up.

2561
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:32,220
Yeah.

2562
01:41:34,940 --> 01:41:36,660
Oh my god.

2563
01:41:36,660 --> 01:41:37,180
Oh, I got hooked.

2564
01:41:38,040 --> 01:41:39,820
There's like three people there.

2565
01:41:39,980 --> 01:41:41,000
You're so dead.

2566
01:41:41,140 --> 01:41:42,900
Okay, they used like every ult.

2567
01:41:43,540 --> 01:41:45,100
Okay, I'm fucking backing out for it.

2568
01:41:46,860 --> 01:41:48,460
Nice, we can just go farm and take the buffs.

2569
01:41:51,020 --> 01:41:53,960
They used Inferno's Dynamo, Haze, and Mooncrawl.

2570
01:41:54,880 --> 01:41:58,960
Okay, I'm backing out of green.

2571
01:41:59,960 --> 01:42:00,280
Yeah.

2572
01:42:03,700 --> 01:42:05,220
I'm gonna farm here a little.

2573
01:42:07,060 --> 01:42:08,540
Oh, I don't care if it's on me.

2574
01:42:08,760 --> 01:42:09,640
I can hold green.

2575
01:42:10,140 --> 01:42:11,840
Yeah, we can fight for this, Aaron.

2576
01:42:12,900 --> 01:42:13,760
Okay, I'll be here.

2577
01:42:14,920 --> 01:42:15,280
Dynamo.

2578
01:42:18,420 --> 01:42:20,320
I'm gonna come over purple, man.

2579
01:42:21,200 --> 01:42:21,780
Mommy, wait.

2580
01:42:22,480 --> 01:42:23,540
I don't know why I tried to hook you.

2581
01:42:23,760 --> 01:42:24,800
Alright, I'm heading over.

2582
01:42:25,680 --> 01:42:27,540
Yeah, we can...

2583
01:42:27,540 --> 01:42:30,200
Or walkers have.

2584
01:42:31,960 --> 01:42:33,760
You wanna push that wave out there?

2585
01:42:33,760 --> 01:42:35,440
Wanna push where?

2586
01:42:36,260 --> 01:42:37,340
Push that green wave.

2587
01:42:37,460 --> 01:42:38,400
Okay, yeah.

2588
01:42:39,220 --> 01:42:40,880
I'm gonna push the yellow while you guys are doing Aaron.

2589
01:42:43,080 --> 01:42:45,860
Oh, they got the Aaron.

2590
01:42:45,980 --> 01:42:46,900
There's a lot here.

2591
01:42:47,620 --> 01:42:48,620
I'm coming over to you guys.

2592
01:42:49,160 --> 01:42:50,580
We should be able to win this.

2593
01:42:50,860 --> 01:42:51,600
Yeah, I'm heading over.

2594
01:42:53,260 --> 01:42:53,960
Dynamo's in blue.

2595
01:42:55,020 --> 01:42:55,420
Nice.

2596
01:42:57,480 --> 01:42:58,280
I see...

2597
01:42:59,200 --> 01:43:00,840
Dynamo's coming over now.

2598
01:43:00,840 --> 01:43:02,080
I'm on the Wraith.

2599
01:43:03,700 --> 01:43:04,720
Pyro's in front of me.

2600
01:43:05,380 --> 01:43:06,360
I'm getting Wraith ulted.

2601
01:43:07,740 --> 01:43:08,660
Pyro's behind you guys.

2602
01:43:08,740 --> 01:43:09,500
Dynamo's behind you guys.

2603
01:43:11,920 --> 01:43:12,560
You got him?

2604
01:43:13,500 --> 01:43:13,980
We should...

2605
01:43:15,220 --> 01:43:16,520
Can we mid boss?

2606
01:43:17,200 --> 01:43:17,660
Oh, sure.

2607
01:43:19,860 --> 01:43:21,060
I'm crushing the walker.

2608
01:43:22,180 --> 01:43:23,020
We have a bird.

2609
01:43:26,560 --> 01:43:27,560
I'm starting it.

2610
01:43:27,560 --> 01:43:28,800
Never calm.

2611
01:43:28,880 --> 01:43:33,840
I don't think we can.

2612
01:43:34,100 --> 01:43:35,020
Yeah, it's probably not.

2613
01:43:35,220 --> 01:43:36,700
Yeah, I'm backing up.

2614
01:43:38,640 --> 01:43:39,840
You're too far away from it.

2615
01:43:40,700 --> 01:43:41,900
Yeah, we can just take their farm.

2616
01:43:42,160 --> 01:43:43,460
Push in on the walkers.

2617
01:43:45,160 --> 01:43:45,520
Yippee!

2618
01:43:46,120 --> 01:43:47,260
Wait, I want to push this farm.

2619
01:43:47,400 --> 01:43:48,200
I want to push blue farm.

2620
01:43:48,320 --> 01:43:50,520
Can we kill them again and then the boss is a little weak for us?

2621
01:43:51,280 --> 01:43:52,140
We can stop them.

2622
01:43:53,580 --> 01:43:54,700
They're shooting me.

2623
01:43:54,700 --> 01:43:55,580
Push mode activate.

2624
01:43:56,260 --> 01:43:57,380
I'm going on Dynamo.

2625
01:43:59,760 --> 01:44:01,500
I'm going to grab this farm real quick.

2626
01:44:07,680 --> 01:44:08,940
He's just hiding there.

2627
01:44:09,160 --> 01:44:10,160
There's a Haze in blue.

2628
01:44:12,460 --> 01:44:13,660
There's a Moe and Haze.

2629
01:44:13,740 --> 01:44:14,280
Oh, they're all there.

2630
01:44:14,380 --> 01:44:14,680
They're all in blue.

2631
01:44:15,380 --> 01:44:16,560
I saw three on blue.

2632
01:44:18,900 --> 01:44:19,860
Blue tower.

2633
01:44:20,340 --> 01:44:20,780
I'm a bird.

2634
01:44:22,560 --> 01:44:25,460
Yeah, it's way too late.

2635
01:44:25,460 --> 01:44:27,140
Oh, you are by yourself.

2636
01:44:27,920 --> 01:44:29,160
I'm so dead.

2637
01:44:29,460 --> 01:44:31,800
Yeah, I'm like watching this.

2638
01:44:31,880 --> 01:44:33,760
I can try to deny their farm.

2639
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:35,380
They burned three ults.

2640
01:44:35,540 --> 01:44:35,960
Yeah, yeah.

2641
01:44:36,020 --> 01:44:36,900
They burned Bebop ult.

2642
01:44:37,800 --> 01:44:38,880
They burned four ults.

2643
01:44:39,020 --> 01:44:40,880
Holy shit, just for you?

2644
01:44:41,060 --> 01:44:42,120
What did you do to them?

2645
01:44:43,020 --> 01:44:44,560
What did you do?

2646
01:44:45,420 --> 01:44:46,420
I just existed.

2647
01:44:46,580 --> 01:44:47,460
They don't like Europeans.

2648
01:44:48,960 --> 01:44:51,800
They don't like that you betrayed America.

2649
01:44:52,460 --> 01:44:53,900
There's a Moe coming to you.

2650
01:44:53,900 --> 01:44:55,760
There's two coming to you in green.

2651
01:44:57,140 --> 01:44:57,960
I'm chilling.

2652
01:44:58,160 --> 01:44:58,980
I'm going to go purple.

2653
01:44:59,600 --> 01:45:01,340
It looks like they're collapsing on green.

2654
01:45:01,680 --> 01:45:02,260
Yeah, they are.

2655
01:45:02,420 --> 01:45:03,060
I backed up.

2656
01:45:03,420 --> 01:45:04,120
Moe's up here with me.

2657
01:45:08,260 --> 01:45:10,520
They were so mad that you betrayed America.

2658
01:45:11,180 --> 01:45:12,200
From just one game.

2659
01:45:13,960 --> 01:45:17,040
I can push green whenever.

2660
01:45:19,100 --> 01:45:19,660
I'm waiting.

2661
01:45:22,080 --> 01:45:23,200
Oh, I'm in trouble.

2662
01:45:23,200 --> 01:45:25,020
I'm with you.

2663
01:45:25,240 --> 01:45:26,680
Oh, I am in trouble.

2664
01:45:27,040 --> 01:45:27,740
Oh, you are.

2665
01:45:27,880 --> 01:45:29,160
I'm trying to help you.

2666
01:45:29,520 --> 01:45:30,140
Wait, nevermind.

2667
01:45:30,260 --> 01:45:33,280
They slept in Wraith ulting me.

2668
01:45:34,140 --> 01:45:35,820
I'm pretty sure I get purple walker here.

2669
01:45:36,740 --> 01:45:38,060
Yeah, you can probably get up.

2670
01:45:41,200 --> 01:45:43,080
There's a Moe here in front of me.

2671
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:44,460
Yep.

2672
01:45:45,240 --> 01:45:45,960
There's three.

2673
01:45:46,240 --> 01:45:46,780
There's four.

2674
01:45:46,880 --> 01:45:47,160
There's four.

2675
01:45:47,640 --> 01:45:51,720
Yeah, you got the walker then.

2676
01:45:51,720 --> 01:45:53,360
I'm going blue.

2677
01:45:54,020 --> 01:45:55,740
I don't know where to go.

2678
01:45:57,100 --> 01:45:58,820
You can just stay far instead.

2679
01:45:59,080 --> 01:46:01,680
Just look for the green triangles.

2680
01:46:02,520 --> 01:46:03,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2681
01:46:04,820 --> 01:46:05,380
Alright.

2682
01:46:12,270 --> 01:46:14,270
There's a Haze on Wraith.

2683
01:46:14,870 --> 01:46:16,230
I'm going to steal their shot.

2684
01:46:16,930 --> 01:46:17,970
I'll get you on Wraith.

2685
01:46:19,350 --> 01:46:20,810
They can probably push the blue walker.

2686
01:46:22,970 --> 01:46:24,270
I'm already on it.

2687
01:46:25,450 --> 01:46:26,010
Hello.

2688
01:46:26,190 --> 01:46:26,530
We're here.

2689
01:46:27,790 --> 01:46:28,930
We're here to help.

2690
01:46:29,830 --> 01:46:32,470
I'm afraid of the five ult burn here.

2691
01:46:33,030 --> 01:46:34,550
Nice, we got the walker.

2692
01:46:34,870 --> 01:46:35,470
Buffed her up.

2693
01:46:42,140 --> 01:46:44,020
There's a B-Bomb coming over.

2694
01:46:47,570 --> 01:46:49,210
I'm going to steal your fucking farm.

2695
01:46:49,730 --> 01:46:50,690
Oh, I shouldn't.

2696
01:46:50,810 --> 01:46:51,330
They're coming over.

2697
01:46:52,430 --> 01:46:54,290
They might be collapsing on you.

2698
01:46:56,150 --> 01:46:57,070
I'm sorry.

2699
01:46:57,210 --> 01:46:58,190
It was a joke.

2700
01:46:58,190 --> 01:47:00,270
It was a prank, bro.

2701
01:47:00,270 --> 01:47:01,590
It was a prank.

2702
01:47:02,030 --> 01:47:03,690
Me to try and steal it.

2703
01:47:09,470 --> 01:47:12,250
You did not have to be splitting farm with me.

2704
01:47:14,270 --> 01:47:15,350
We got the Urn.

2705
01:47:16,450 --> 01:47:16,670
Okay.

2706
01:47:16,910 --> 01:47:19,930
They want our purple Guardian also.

2707
01:47:20,050 --> 01:47:21,170
There's an Infernus on me.

2708
01:47:23,310 --> 01:47:25,910
Okay, I'm heading over.

2709
01:47:25,910 --> 01:47:27,730
I'm going to support Urn.

2710
01:47:28,390 --> 01:47:29,450
Infernus ulted me.

2711
01:47:29,890 --> 01:47:30,470
I should be okay.

2712
01:47:31,050 --> 01:47:32,030
I'm heading over to you guys.

2713
01:47:32,850 --> 01:47:34,450
I got Haze and Mooncrawl.

2714
01:47:35,270 --> 01:47:36,590
There's a Wraith here too.

2715
01:47:37,610 --> 01:47:38,690
We should go check out the Urn.

2716
01:47:38,930 --> 01:47:39,930
I don't know where the Dynamo went.

2717
01:47:40,290 --> 01:47:42,130
I'm heading to the area now.

2718
01:47:42,890 --> 01:47:43,610
Just in case.

2719
01:47:45,710 --> 01:47:47,330
They have no Hazel and no Mooncrawl.

2720
01:47:47,410 --> 01:47:47,870
They're both purple.

2721
01:47:50,430 --> 01:47:51,590
I'm heading over.

2722
01:47:52,650 --> 01:47:54,230
There's a Void coming.

2723
01:47:54,710 --> 01:47:55,970
We can get the Urn.

2724
01:47:55,970 --> 01:47:56,770
We can turn it in.

2725
01:47:56,990 --> 01:47:59,310
When I'm up, I can go purple or blue.

2726
01:47:59,970 --> 01:48:01,030
Monocle is right there.

2727
01:48:05,250 --> 01:48:06,870
Might be looking to fight for no reason.

2728
01:48:08,110 --> 01:48:08,610
That's fine.

2729
01:48:10,650 --> 01:48:11,830
I can clear purple.

2730
01:48:12,630 --> 01:48:13,470
And then probably blue.

2731
01:48:13,630 --> 01:48:15,110
I'm just going to grab this real fast.

2732
01:48:18,050 --> 01:48:19,090
Heading over to you guys.

2733
01:48:19,630 --> 01:48:20,770
I'm coming over green then.

2734
01:48:22,430 --> 01:48:23,670
I'm here in green too.

2735
01:48:28,610 --> 01:48:30,050
Are we pushing up?

2736
01:48:30,810 --> 01:48:31,870
Void is just killing everyone.

2737
01:48:32,090 --> 01:48:32,650
That's what's happening.

2738
01:48:32,990 --> 01:48:33,410
Oh, nice.

2739
01:48:33,530 --> 01:48:33,750
Cool.

2740
01:48:39,830 --> 01:48:43,370
Do we have time to do mid-boss?

2741
01:48:46,850 --> 01:48:48,310
I think I'm going to push.

2742
01:48:48,610 --> 01:48:49,510
Infernus is on green.

2743
01:48:52,810 --> 01:48:54,310
I don't know where to go.

2744
01:48:55,250 --> 01:48:56,470
We're on mid-boss right now.

2745
01:48:59,230 --> 01:49:00,070
I'm here to help.

2746
01:49:00,190 --> 01:49:01,210
Dynamo is far on yellow.

2747
01:49:02,590 --> 01:49:03,570
Infernus is not close either.

2748
01:49:05,090 --> 01:49:06,250
I'm pushing out a little bit.

2749
01:49:06,810 --> 01:49:07,330
I'll parry.

2750
01:49:08,370 --> 01:49:11,290
I'm going to fly and look around.

2751
01:49:13,190 --> 01:49:13,550
Nice.

2752
01:49:17,150 --> 01:49:17,950
Yes sir!

2753
01:49:17,950 --> 01:49:18,030
Yes sir!

2754
01:49:21,270 --> 01:49:23,430
What do I upgrade next?

2755
01:49:23,650 --> 01:49:31,050
I'll probably just shove some waves here.

2756
01:49:31,870 --> 01:49:33,550
I found Link can fly some more stuff.

2757
01:49:35,450 --> 01:49:36,990
Oh, there's a mowing curl in green.

2758
01:49:38,150 --> 01:49:39,430
In this line, bro.

2759
01:49:48,580 --> 01:49:50,620
Oh, Infernus is in green.

2760
01:49:50,620 --> 01:49:50,660
In this line.

2761
01:49:54,460 --> 01:49:55,160
I'm here.

2762
01:49:55,500 --> 01:49:56,620
If you want to get crazy.

2763
01:49:57,140 --> 01:49:58,260
I'm here too.

2764
01:49:59,120 --> 01:50:02,120
I'm down to get some freaky right now.

2765
01:50:02,380 --> 01:50:03,140
You guys want to get freaky?

2766
01:50:03,360 --> 01:50:04,580
Yeah, I'm fucking ready.

2767
01:50:05,540 --> 01:50:07,040
Wraith is coming over from blue.

2768
01:50:11,540 --> 01:50:13,300
They clicked all of the ultimates.

2769
01:50:13,420 --> 01:50:15,500
They clicked everything.

2770
01:50:15,840 --> 01:50:17,760
I stunned everybody, by the way.

2771
01:50:19,160 --> 01:50:21,400
There's no way I lived through this, right?

2772
01:50:23,180 --> 01:50:24,540
Oh my god.

2773
01:50:25,040 --> 01:50:26,660
Okay, we did it.

2774
01:50:28,120 --> 01:50:29,980
What the fuck happened?

2775
01:50:31,900 --> 01:50:34,420
I don't even know what the fuck happened there.

2776
01:50:40,320 --> 01:50:42,980
Holy shit, we actually did get freaky.

2777
01:50:44,780 --> 01:50:45,880
I'm in with you.

2778
01:50:46,720 --> 01:50:47,580
Hello, thank you.

2779
01:50:48,280 --> 01:50:48,820
I can tether.

2780
01:50:58,340 --> 01:50:59,080
I don't know.

2781
01:51:00,020 --> 01:51:00,380
Nice.

2782
01:51:02,540 --> 01:51:04,640
Getting freaky right now.

2783
01:51:06,660 --> 01:51:08,740
Wow, I was wondering where the Wraith was.

2784
01:51:08,820 --> 01:51:10,640
Oh yeah, freaky time!

2785
01:51:15,810 --> 01:51:17,590
Oh, thank god this was a 20 game.

2786
01:51:20,270 --> 01:51:21,530
Yeah, what about the next game though?

2787
01:51:21,750 --> 01:51:22,250
Oh, no.

2788
01:51:22,250 --> 01:51:22,570
What?

2789
01:51:28,350 --> 01:51:29,810
Alright, the Patron.

2790
01:51:36,530 --> 01:51:38,790
Oh yeah, you're gonna go inside?

2791
01:51:42,530 --> 01:51:44,570
The streamer is awesome.

2792
01:51:44,990 --> 01:51:46,070
Oh my goodness.

2793
01:51:46,070 --> 01:51:47,650
The Patron's up right now.

2794
01:51:48,150 --> 01:51:50,250
I'm getting moaned for ulting me!

2795
01:51:50,250 --> 01:51:53,030
I'm getting moaned for ulting me!

2796
01:51:54,610 --> 01:51:55,830
Oh shit, hey.

2797
01:51:59,470 --> 01:52:01,650
Bro, what am I looking at?

2798
01:52:04,730 --> 01:52:06,370
You don't know how to parry.

2799
01:52:06,510 --> 01:52:08,810
Wait, I just realized these players don't know how to parry.

2800
01:52:17,420 --> 01:52:17,800
Nice.

2801
01:52:18,880 --> 01:52:19,400
Nice.

2802
01:52:25,460 --> 01:52:27,360
Oh my god, this is what it would've been.

2803
01:52:27,440 --> 01:52:28,480
Yeah, this is it.

2804
01:52:31,460 --> 01:52:32,180
Nice.

2805
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:35,280
We did it!

2806
01:52:35,540 --> 01:52:36,260
Yippee!

2807
01:52:41,220 --> 01:52:42,920
Oh my god.

2808
01:52:44,540 --> 01:52:45,140
Yay!

2809
01:52:47,180 --> 01:52:47,900
What?

2810
01:52:48,300 --> 01:52:48,460
What?

2811
01:52:52,400 --> 01:52:53,000
What?

2812
01:52:53,120 --> 01:52:54,120
Wait, is it like straight after?

2813
01:52:56,920 --> 01:52:57,860
Apparently, yeah.

2814
01:52:58,100 --> 01:52:58,520
Straight after?

2815
01:52:59,420 --> 01:53:01,400
Okay, wait, if it's immediately, okay.

2816
01:53:02,520 --> 01:53:02,820
Okay.

2817
01:53:03,580 --> 01:53:06,500
Is the game...

2818
01:53:06,500 --> 01:53:08,180
If it's immediately, okay, let me see.

2819
01:53:08,500 --> 01:53:10,780
I might be 30 minutes late.

2820
01:53:12,780 --> 01:53:13,980
We made it.

2821
01:53:14,320 --> 01:53:15,260
We made it.

2822
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:16,660
We made it.

2823
01:53:16,820 --> 01:53:18,300
I'm mid-tournament.

2824
01:53:19,280 --> 01:53:22,080
We made it too far in the tournament.

2825
01:53:24,620 --> 01:53:27,980
It's for charity and for the kids.

2826
01:53:33,540 --> 01:53:35,760
Oh my god, they're watching the stream.

2827
01:53:35,900 --> 01:53:36,660
Yes, ASAP.

2828
01:53:36,800 --> 01:53:39,520
Okay, here's the...

2829
01:53:39,520 --> 01:53:40,440
Here it is.

2830
01:53:41,600 --> 01:53:42,260
The...

2831
01:53:42,260 --> 01:53:43,440
The thing, okay.

2832
01:53:43,740 --> 01:53:44,920
We gotta do this instant.

2833
01:53:45,480 --> 01:53:45,900
Alright.

2834
01:53:47,340 --> 01:53:50,320
It's for the kids.

2835
01:53:55,150 --> 01:53:57,110
We are doing it for them.

2836
01:53:57,690 --> 01:53:58,830
Alright, who are we banning?

2837
01:53:59,050 --> 01:53:59,630
For the kids.

2838
01:54:00,210 --> 01:54:01,470
Are we banning children?

2839
01:54:03,990 --> 01:54:04,350
Are we?

2840
01:54:04,510 --> 01:54:05,050
No, no.

2841
01:54:05,250 --> 01:54:07,390
The team that beat the shit out of us.

2842
01:54:07,710 --> 01:54:08,130
Advanced.

2843
01:54:11,070 --> 01:54:11,690
Let's go!

2844
01:54:11,690 --> 01:54:12,570
I like that, I like that.

2845
01:54:13,870 --> 01:54:17,570
Wait, are we down to ban McGuinness?

2846
01:54:18,170 --> 01:54:19,590
I mean, do we need to?

2847
01:54:19,830 --> 01:54:20,350
Do we need to?

2848
01:54:20,450 --> 01:54:21,310
Do they play McGuinness?

2849
01:54:21,410 --> 01:54:22,450
We can literally check their bots.

2850
01:54:22,790 --> 01:54:26,610
Cory, someone check the bots right now!

2851
01:54:28,810 --> 01:54:30,130
Okay, wait, chat, chat!

2852
01:54:30,770 --> 01:54:31,710
The team we're playing.

2853
01:54:32,850 --> 01:54:33,290
Aqua.

2854
01:54:34,050 --> 01:54:35,450
Did they ban...

2855
01:54:35,450 --> 01:54:36,990
Do they have McGuinness?

2856
01:54:38,110 --> 01:54:39,210
I like this.

2857
01:54:39,210 --> 01:54:40,270
This is our strat.

2858
01:54:40,530 --> 01:54:42,570
Chat, who should we draft?

2859
01:54:42,770 --> 01:54:43,130
Hurry up.

2860
01:54:45,490 --> 01:54:46,250
Chat, please.

2861
01:54:46,450 --> 01:54:47,150
For the kids.

2862
01:54:47,270 --> 01:54:50,430
We just need to know if, you know...

2863
01:54:52,590 --> 01:54:53,990
Wait, we haven't read it up yet, right?

2864
01:54:54,070 --> 01:54:55,630
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2865
01:54:56,910 --> 01:54:58,050
They're scouting us out.

2866
01:54:59,270 --> 01:55:00,090
They don't know what we play.

2867
01:55:00,210 --> 01:55:01,050
We play everything.

2868
01:55:03,010 --> 01:55:04,250
Don't worry, I'll unready.

2869
01:55:05,510 --> 01:55:08,130
My chat was telling me they're calling us by our in-game name.

2870
01:55:08,230 --> 01:55:09,610
So, like, yo, Jam Jimadome.

2871
01:55:11,750 --> 01:55:12,630
Jam Jimadome!

2872
01:55:13,010 --> 01:55:13,930
With the pic!

2873
01:55:15,130 --> 01:55:16,790
Owner of the Jam's El Jimadome.

2874
01:55:16,870 --> 01:55:17,330
That's him.

2875
01:55:18,730 --> 01:55:22,250
So, I was like, are you asking us to stream snipe for the kids?

2876
01:55:22,970 --> 01:55:24,910
Well, this is a charity.

2877
01:55:25,650 --> 01:55:26,910
The kids would be down.

2878
01:55:27,270 --> 01:55:29,210
You know what?

2879
01:55:29,290 --> 01:55:31,410
The kids would absolutely love that.

2880
01:55:32,750 --> 01:55:33,930
Kids love stream sniping.

2881
01:55:33,930 --> 01:55:35,350
It's their favorite hobby.

2882
01:55:40,490 --> 01:55:41,010
Who's banning?

2883
01:55:42,030 --> 01:55:42,790
They're EU!

2884
01:55:43,050 --> 01:55:46,010
But we can ask for the most...

2885
01:55:46,010 --> 01:55:47,250
We can ask for...

2886
01:55:47,250 --> 01:55:48,610
Yeah, an East Coast server.

2887
01:55:49,250 --> 01:55:51,330
We could be like, can we have East Coast?

2888
01:55:51,470 --> 01:55:53,470
So it's in the middle between all of us.

2889
01:55:55,410 --> 01:55:57,550
They should just put a server in the middle of the ocean.

2890
01:55:57,710 --> 01:55:58,530
You want me to ban?

2891
01:55:59,110 --> 01:56:01,290
Are we all in agreement with banning Kelvin?

2892
01:56:01,290 --> 01:56:01,990
Sure.

2893
01:56:05,170 --> 01:56:08,290
They banned Pocket.

2894
01:56:09,070 --> 01:56:09,870
Wow.

2895
01:56:10,750 --> 01:56:11,230
Haters.

2896
01:56:12,090 --> 01:56:12,550
Pocket?

2897
01:56:13,070 --> 01:56:15,450
Pocket is his second best character.

2898
01:56:16,270 --> 01:56:16,790
It's true.

2899
01:56:17,330 --> 01:56:18,450
That's not even his first pick.

2900
01:56:18,550 --> 01:56:21,350
Should I pick Hayes?

2901
01:56:22,630 --> 01:56:23,110
Probably Abrams.

2902
01:56:23,430 --> 01:56:25,590
Oh, they're picking Abrams already.

2903
01:56:26,650 --> 01:56:26,970
No!

2904
01:56:28,130 --> 01:56:29,410
I need to pick Hayes.

2905
01:56:31,290 --> 01:56:33,190
Why are they always first picking?

2906
01:56:33,270 --> 01:56:35,070
And then I'm locking in Peridot.

2907
01:56:35,510 --> 01:56:37,970
How did they always first pick every time?

2908
01:56:38,710 --> 01:56:39,610
You should pick Viscous.

2909
01:56:42,210 --> 01:56:43,290
He saw me hover.

2910
01:56:43,650 --> 01:56:44,470
He's only a Viscous player.

2911
01:56:46,770 --> 01:56:48,370
He's a demon on the goo man.

2912
01:56:48,550 --> 01:56:49,590
He saw me hover.

2913
01:56:49,990 --> 01:56:51,530
There's like a puffer fish in his helmet.

2914
01:56:52,090 --> 01:56:54,990
Yeah, Viscous is like goo from the sea.

2915
01:56:54,990 --> 01:56:56,670
Also, I gave you guys the new code, by the way.

2916
01:56:57,410 --> 01:56:58,190
Oh, there's a new code?

2917
01:56:58,190 --> 01:56:58,690
Is that the lore?

2918
01:56:59,270 --> 01:57:00,610
Yeah, that's the lore.

2919
01:57:02,370 --> 01:57:04,630
They chose Vindicta?!

2920
01:57:06,190 --> 01:57:07,930
It's okay, I play V-Buff.

2921
01:57:16,310 --> 01:57:18,730
Can we just like forfeit right now?

2922
01:57:26,580 --> 01:57:28,240
Okay, it's our turn, right?

2923
01:57:28,240 --> 01:57:30,680
So, we want...

2924
01:57:30,680 --> 01:57:31,740
Oh no, it's Talon's turn.

2925
01:57:40,730 --> 01:57:48,650
I could play Paradox, but I think I might want to play Warden.

2926
01:57:49,350 --> 01:57:50,290
You want Warden instead?

2927
01:57:50,690 --> 01:57:51,450
Pick me...

2928
01:57:51,450 --> 01:57:55,230
I don't mind having the choice right now.

2929
01:57:55,330 --> 01:57:56,150
So we can pick other people.

2930
01:57:56,790 --> 01:57:57,690
Pick me Lash.

2931
01:57:58,590 --> 01:58:00,070
You want Lash?

2932
01:58:00,570 --> 01:58:01,550
Yeah, frick it.

2933
01:58:01,770 --> 01:58:02,890
Don't you also play Wraith?

2934
01:58:06,150 --> 01:58:06,870
Yeah, but...

2935
01:58:06,870 --> 01:58:10,650
Yeah, my mouse is bugging out when I hold left click.

2936
01:58:15,540 --> 01:58:17,020
Did I give the wrong...

2937
01:58:17,020 --> 01:58:20,100
I feel like Lash is an insane pick after they do Vindicta greats.

2938
01:58:20,740 --> 01:58:22,100
Yeah, Lash is a good choice.

2939
01:58:22,320 --> 01:58:23,940
I also play Lash if you want to pick something else.

2940
01:58:24,880 --> 01:58:26,380
If you want to play Lash, we can do that, sure.

2941
01:58:26,900 --> 01:58:28,400
Actually, because I think...

2942
01:58:29,240 --> 01:58:30,220
Well, let's see what they pick.

2943
01:58:31,280 --> 01:58:32,500
They picked Dynamo.

2944
01:58:32,960 --> 01:58:33,920
It's our turn.

2945
01:58:35,100 --> 01:58:36,840
How the frick did they always first pick?

2946
01:58:38,620 --> 01:58:39,060
Yeah.

2947
01:58:39,880 --> 01:58:41,560
I'm also down to play Infernus.

2948
01:58:42,340 --> 01:58:43,300
Infernus, I'm down.

2949
01:58:43,580 --> 01:58:45,220
I'm down to lock in Infernus.

2950
01:58:45,480 --> 01:58:47,280
We know they're EU.

2951
01:58:47,680 --> 01:58:49,280
They are EU.

2952
01:58:49,300 --> 01:58:51,520
We can try and ask for an ESCO server.

2953
01:58:53,540 --> 01:58:54,800
Can we get an ESCO server?

2954
01:58:54,800 --> 01:59:00,200
As a fellow European, I think a US West server...

2955
01:59:00,200 --> 01:59:01,200
Yeah, yeah.

2956
01:59:01,200 --> 01:59:04,080
It's only fair for the kids.

2957
01:59:05,620 --> 01:59:07,560
We're literally here for the children.

2958
01:59:09,200 --> 01:59:10,240
Oh, look at that.

2959
01:59:10,360 --> 01:59:10,960
For the children.

2960
01:59:12,060 --> 01:59:14,040
They care about the kids.

2961
01:59:14,280 --> 01:59:15,760
I mean, that's where the majority of the children are, right?

2962
01:59:15,820 --> 01:59:15,940
Yeah.

2963
01:59:18,860 --> 01:59:19,260
Yeah.

2964
01:59:20,260 --> 01:59:21,860
Most people do live on the East Coast.

2965
01:59:22,120 --> 01:59:22,480
Sure, sure.

2966
01:59:22,620 --> 01:59:24,820
We combine the majority of the children on the East Coast.

2967
01:59:24,920 --> 01:59:27,880
I'm pretty sure that's more than London, right?

2968
01:59:27,880 --> 01:59:30,020
It might be.

2969
01:59:40,080 --> 01:59:43,860
Our team is like, kind of tanky.

2970
01:59:44,140 --> 01:59:45,120
I like our team.

2971
01:59:45,380 --> 01:59:47,520
I'm down for Bbop or McGuinness.

2972
01:59:48,540 --> 01:59:50,560
I have two open slots.

2973
01:59:50,880 --> 01:59:51,620
I'm down for the McGuinness.

2974
01:59:52,720 --> 01:59:53,060
Okay.

2975
01:59:53,420 --> 01:59:56,340
I mean, Bbop into the Flyers is...

2976
01:59:56,340 --> 01:59:57,780
Are you a hook god?

2977
01:59:58,440 --> 01:59:59,280
I don't know if I'm a hook god.

2978
02:00:01,040 --> 02:00:02,440
I'm a bomb god.

2979
02:00:02,820 --> 02:00:04,260
Hook god, on the other hand.

2980
02:00:06,960 --> 02:00:07,720
Okay, I'm a beam god.

2981
02:00:07,960 --> 02:00:09,380
It must be a beam god.

2982
02:00:11,080 --> 02:00:12,040
Beam god.

2983
02:00:12,680 --> 02:00:13,940
We want Bbop?

2984
02:00:14,320 --> 02:00:14,740
Bbop?

2985
02:00:16,060 --> 02:00:17,380
I don't know what I want.

2986
02:00:17,800 --> 02:00:19,100
I'm easily swayed.

2987
02:00:19,180 --> 02:00:20,060
I need to be told.

2988
02:00:20,300 --> 02:00:20,860
I don't know.

2989
02:00:22,100 --> 02:00:25,080
I'm playing this the 11th time I've played the game.

2990
02:00:25,080 --> 02:00:27,140
I believe in the Bbop.

2991
02:00:27,640 --> 02:00:28,360
Bbop.

2992
02:00:28,620 --> 02:00:29,060
Bbop.

2993
02:00:30,880 --> 02:00:31,520
Flawless draft.

2994
02:00:33,220 --> 02:00:34,520
We're tanky.

2995
02:00:34,820 --> 02:00:36,040
We're tanky.

2996
02:00:36,360 --> 02:00:37,440
They can't kill us.

2997
02:00:38,040 --> 02:00:39,240
They can't kill us now.

2998
02:00:39,940 --> 02:00:41,360
You can't milk those.

2999
02:00:41,780 --> 02:00:42,000
What?

3000
02:00:42,520 --> 02:00:42,780
What?

3001
02:00:43,160 --> 02:00:43,460
What?

3002
02:00:48,680 --> 02:00:50,520
I want Arlene.

3003
02:00:50,520 --> 02:00:50,580
Where are the other teams?

3004
02:00:53,220 --> 02:00:54,700
I'm down for wherever.

3005
02:01:00,270 --> 02:01:01,310
Where's the other team?

3006
02:01:01,390 --> 02:01:02,070
Oh, there they are.

3007
02:01:03,050 --> 02:01:04,850
I'm just happy we're on East Coast.

3008
02:01:05,010 --> 02:01:07,050
Who finishes as well with Bbop?

3009
02:01:07,570 --> 02:01:09,570
I don't know if I want a solo lane, per se.

3010
02:01:11,490 --> 02:01:13,750
Who's going to play in my lane?

3011
02:01:14,450 --> 02:01:15,210
I'm going to be Haze.

3012
02:01:16,490 --> 02:01:18,230
Oh wait, if they're watching my stream...

3013
02:01:18,230 --> 02:01:19,770
I'm going to be...

3014
02:01:21,050 --> 02:01:21,490
Infernus.

3015
02:01:21,490 --> 02:01:22,170
You're going to be Warden.

3016
02:01:22,470 --> 02:01:23,930
Yeah, I'm going to be Warden.

3017
02:01:24,750 --> 02:01:28,430
What are the other characters in this game?

3018
02:01:29,510 --> 02:01:30,370
What are you guys going to do?

3019
02:01:30,630 --> 02:01:33,050
I prefer not solo laning.

3020
02:01:34,070 --> 02:01:34,670
Not much.

3021
02:01:35,750 --> 02:01:37,410
I have no prep.

3022
02:01:37,590 --> 02:01:39,610
Guys, the kids are depending on us.

3023
02:01:39,770 --> 02:01:40,010
Guys.

3024
02:01:40,910 --> 02:01:42,330
The kids are depending on us.

3025
02:01:45,240 --> 02:01:46,930
If we lose...

3026
02:01:47,490 --> 02:01:49,710
We will disappoint the NA children.

3027
02:01:51,490 --> 02:01:51,770
What do you guys want?

3028
02:01:52,870 --> 02:01:55,150
As long as I don't fight Wraith, I think I'm good.

3029
02:01:55,350 --> 02:01:55,910
I can stick with Gumi.

3030
02:01:57,330 --> 02:01:59,550
You want to solo, Warden, or do you want me to go?

3031
02:02:00,010 --> 02:02:00,750
I can go solo.

3032
02:02:01,770 --> 02:02:02,450
If Wraith's in blue.

3033
02:02:03,430 --> 02:02:05,730
Vindicta is on green lane.

3034
02:02:07,170 --> 02:02:08,390
Do you want to go, Gumi?

3035
02:02:09,150 --> 02:02:10,550
No, I'm just saying it.

3036
02:02:11,750 --> 02:02:12,770
If that matters.

3037
02:02:15,210 --> 02:02:17,550
I don't want Gumi against Warden.

3038
02:02:19,090 --> 02:02:19,610
Yeah.

3039
02:02:20,450 --> 02:02:21,490
Me and Gumi can swap.

3040
02:02:22,030 --> 02:02:22,730
Watch out, Void.

3041
02:02:22,790 --> 02:02:23,550
You're against moron ultimate.

3042
02:02:24,010 --> 02:02:25,210
I don't want to lane with Doki.

3043
02:02:26,170 --> 02:02:27,490
What's that supposed to mean?

3044
02:02:27,490 --> 02:02:28,630
I'm an ultimate player.

3045
02:02:29,410 --> 02:02:31,990
I don't really know how to farm that well.

3046
02:02:32,370 --> 02:02:33,810
All I know is bomb.

3047
02:02:34,570 --> 02:02:34,970
And Doki.

3048
02:02:35,390 --> 02:02:36,490
And I don't know anything.

3049
02:02:38,430 --> 02:02:40,550
It's like putting two dweebs together.

3050
02:02:40,850 --> 02:02:41,350
In a locker.

3051
02:02:43,510 --> 02:02:45,450
So maybe Doki swapped me?

3052
02:02:45,450 --> 02:02:47,530
Two dweebs in one locker.

3053
02:02:50,930 --> 02:02:54,090
I mean, I've jumped into a couple lockers in my life.

3054
02:02:54,170 --> 02:02:55,050
Oh my god, are you okay?

3055
02:02:56,970 --> 02:02:58,830
Because you had no friends back then.

3056
02:03:03,070 --> 02:03:04,930
That was reflex, I'm sorry.

3057
02:03:11,390 --> 02:03:13,010
Okay, Doki, do you know how to swap?

3058
02:03:13,010 --> 02:03:15,030
Yeah, just walk over to blue.

3059
02:03:15,990 --> 02:03:17,870
Well, you get off the rope early.

3060
02:03:18,170 --> 02:03:19,290
And then you tether to blue.

3061
02:03:19,550 --> 02:03:19,690
Okay.

3062
02:03:25,210 --> 02:03:26,490
What's going on here, guys?

3063
02:03:26,930 --> 02:03:30,110
I feel like Doki has said evil things to me all day long.

3064
02:03:31,630 --> 02:03:33,170
It's too easy.

3065
02:03:33,310 --> 02:03:33,850
I'm sorry.

3066
02:03:34,210 --> 02:03:36,790
He just puts it out there.

3067
02:03:37,250 --> 02:03:39,010
I appreciate you being there.

3068
02:03:39,490 --> 02:03:41,870
Well, Doki, your mom puts it out there.

3069
02:03:55,630 --> 02:03:58,230
At least I have a mom.

3070
02:03:59,790 --> 02:04:00,170
What?

3071
02:04:01,950 --> 02:04:05,210
Who is that talking about?

3072
02:04:07,770 --> 02:04:09,650
Doki, look at your character!

3073
02:04:13,010 --> 02:04:14,350
The time is now.

3074
02:04:14,410 --> 02:04:16,370
Aqua hasn't even locked the character!

3075
02:04:21,150 --> 02:04:22,650
And not even the last person!

3076
02:04:22,810 --> 02:04:24,010
I think Aqua is great.

3077
02:04:24,330 --> 02:04:25,450
Aqua locked it earlier.

3078
02:04:27,670 --> 02:04:30,830
Guys, I think we could go pro in this game with this team.

3079
02:04:30,950 --> 02:04:32,630
I think we got it.

3080
02:04:32,850 --> 02:04:33,470
This is the squad, right?

3081
02:04:38,250 --> 02:04:41,750
Not even the last person who didn't lock the character.

3082
02:04:41,750 --> 02:04:43,530
It's not even my fault.

3083
02:04:43,570 --> 02:04:45,870
They did lock in earlier is the thing.

3084
02:04:47,530 --> 02:04:51,230
If this guy doesn't lock in, I'm gonna be dead.

3085
02:05:01,170 --> 02:05:06,370
The only reason why I'm this toxic is because I'm playing a MOBA and I've never played a MOBA before until now.

3086
02:05:08,250 --> 02:05:09,190
You're like venom.

3087
02:05:09,190 --> 02:05:09,850
It's like spreading.

3088
02:05:10,930 --> 02:05:13,110
It's injected into my veins right now.

3089
02:05:13,250 --> 02:05:14,190
The MOBA toxicity.

3090
02:05:15,670 --> 02:05:18,810
I hear right after the 10 hour mark is where it really kicks in.

3091
02:05:19,070 --> 02:05:20,290
How come you guys aren't toxic?

3092
02:05:20,890 --> 02:05:24,730
Wait, they keep changing it to auto-select region and it's making me nervous.

3093
02:05:24,770 --> 02:05:26,610
You just haven't seen SageM late at night.

3094
02:05:27,090 --> 02:05:28,270
Yeah, you haven't seen me in solo queue.

3095
02:05:29,190 --> 02:05:30,370
You know the best part?

3096
02:05:30,990 --> 02:05:33,850
Late at night, I was like, bro, my team will not group.

3097
02:05:34,010 --> 02:05:37,370
And Danny Shifter was like, oh man, the MOBA's getting you, bro.

3098
02:05:37,510 --> 02:05:38,330
You gotta just chill.

3099
02:05:38,470 --> 02:05:42,350
And then I came in the next day and he was flaming the shit out of his team.

3100
02:05:42,590 --> 02:05:44,330
Wait, somebody is changing you.

3101
02:05:44,510 --> 02:05:45,910
You can change it yourself.

3102
02:05:47,470 --> 02:05:49,210
Somebody else is changing.

3103
02:05:50,150 --> 02:05:51,750
So who's changing it?

3104
02:05:52,430 --> 02:05:53,450
What, the region?

3105
02:05:53,790 --> 02:05:54,150
Yeah.

3106
02:05:54,770 --> 02:05:56,130
I'm changing it back.

3107
02:05:57,290 --> 02:05:58,650
We're battling, literally battling.

3108
02:06:00,510 --> 02:06:02,230
The first battle.

3109
02:06:02,770 --> 02:06:04,150
I'm changing it back.

3110
02:06:09,170 --> 02:06:11,990
I picked Warden specifically for the high ping.

3111
02:06:12,090 --> 02:06:13,110
I don't have to aim my ult.

3112
02:06:13,770 --> 02:06:15,250
Wait, let me turn on cheats real quick.

3113
02:06:15,250 --> 02:06:16,710
Who keeps, oh my god, dead cheats?

3114
02:06:18,910 --> 02:06:19,390
Enable.

3115
02:06:20,250 --> 02:06:21,210
F7, enable.

3116
02:06:21,450 --> 02:06:22,290
Now someone's gone?

3117
02:06:22,550 --> 02:06:24,090
You just kicked that guy right out of the game.

3118
02:06:24,690 --> 02:06:28,890
This cheat's enabled and they're like, I'm not dealing with this.

3119
02:06:28,890 --> 02:06:31,950
What kind of charity event is this?

3120
02:06:32,890 --> 02:06:35,310
That's it, let's forfeit.

3121
02:06:36,530 --> 02:06:39,730
If there's one thing kids love, it's cheating.

3122
02:06:41,550 --> 02:06:45,250
What does cheat's enable do anyway?

3123
02:06:46,890 --> 02:06:50,090
What kind of cheats does it give you?

3124
02:06:53,330 --> 02:06:54,750
Infinite money.

3125
02:06:55,570 --> 02:06:56,750
Walk through walls.

3126
02:06:56,750 --> 02:06:58,270
Hide anywhere.

3127
02:06:58,510 --> 02:07:03,670
Suddenly put bots in and then kick a person out.

3128
02:07:05,030 --> 02:07:06,190
What does it keep saying?

3129
02:07:06,650 --> 02:07:08,790
What are we waiting for anyway?

3130
02:07:09,790 --> 02:07:10,810
I don't know.

3131
02:07:11,130 --> 02:07:11,470
Doki?

3132
02:07:14,630 --> 02:07:15,910
Do some...

3133
02:07:15,910 --> 02:07:17,370
What do you want me to do?

3134
02:07:18,130 --> 02:07:19,070
Do something!

3135
02:07:20,010 --> 02:07:22,310
It could be the broadcast thing, right?

3136
02:07:22,810 --> 02:07:24,750
Yeah, I think they just got...

3137
02:07:25,430 --> 02:07:28,150
They just went back to...

3138
02:07:28,150 --> 02:07:30,710
Then they'll put it back to east, right?

3139
02:07:31,530 --> 02:07:34,050
You know, it could be like hurry up and wait.

3140
02:07:34,770 --> 02:07:36,150
No, I put it on east.

3141
02:07:38,650 --> 02:07:44,430
I don't know if it's the casters putting it on east or...

3142
02:07:45,790 --> 02:07:47,890
I think it might be the players.

3143
02:07:48,830 --> 02:07:49,370
Oh my gosh.

3144
02:07:52,110 --> 02:07:53,690
Oh my gosh.

3145
02:07:53,930 --> 02:07:54,390
What's the word?

3146
02:07:54,730 --> 02:08:00,690
What's the word when you have a sign outside of a store but you're upset at the store?

3147
02:08:02,490 --> 02:08:03,130
Protesting!

3148
02:08:03,330 --> 02:08:03,970
Boycotting!

3149
02:08:05,030 --> 02:08:06,110
We're leaving.

3150
02:08:06,490 --> 02:08:07,710
Sorry, chat.

3151
02:08:12,130 --> 02:08:13,930
They should be back.

3152
02:08:14,010 --> 02:08:15,210
They said they're back now.

3153
02:08:15,730 --> 02:08:17,310
Krusty Krab is unfair.

3154
02:08:17,850 --> 02:08:19,150
Mr. Krabs is in there.

3155
02:08:19,150 --> 02:08:20,170
Mr. Krabs is in there.

3156
02:08:22,170 --> 02:08:23,770
Standing at the concession.

3157
02:08:24,530 --> 02:08:29,310
Oh, they said they're gonna auto-server the server and see what it gives us, but like...

3158
02:08:33,930 --> 02:08:37,010
Someone click the drop-down US East at the last possible second.

3159
02:08:37,550 --> 02:08:39,470
Someone, but it's not gonna be us.

3160
02:08:40,870 --> 02:08:41,470
For the kids.

3161
02:08:43,310 --> 02:08:44,410
Yeah, for the children.

3162
02:08:45,730 --> 02:08:52,090
Someone does it, but like, it's definitely not gonna be us who does that.

3163
02:08:53,630 --> 02:08:57,290
Yeah, I hope it gets South Africa.

3164
02:08:57,950 --> 02:08:59,390
I'm VPNing right now.

3165
02:09:00,710 --> 02:09:01,690
Oh, look at that.

3166
02:09:01,770 --> 02:09:04,150
It's Goomy that doesn't pick at the end.

3167
02:09:04,710 --> 02:09:08,330
I'm VPNing to Antarctica, so that way it autos to South Africa.

3168
02:09:09,270 --> 02:09:10,070
Alright, let's see.

3169
02:09:10,390 --> 02:09:11,710
Let's see what ping we get.

3170
02:09:11,710 --> 02:09:12,190
I'm missing.

3171
02:09:12,550 --> 02:09:13,310
I'm nice.

3172
02:09:13,530 --> 02:09:14,330
Make sure you guys swap.

3173
02:09:17,710 --> 02:09:18,750
231 MS.

3174
02:09:19,210 --> 02:09:20,550
What do you guys get?

3175
02:09:20,750 --> 02:09:22,150
I have 134.

3176
02:09:23,430 --> 02:09:23,910
139.

3177
02:09:25,830 --> 02:09:27,210
You should've given us East.

3178
02:09:27,270 --> 02:09:28,130
Alright guys, I'm gonna roleplay.

3179
02:09:28,290 --> 02:09:29,230
I'm gonna roleplay.

3180
02:09:31,910 --> 02:09:32,390
Alright.

3181
02:09:33,110 --> 02:09:33,710
I'm swapping.

3182
02:09:33,850 --> 02:09:34,170
I jumped.

3183
02:09:34,170 --> 02:09:35,670
Oh my god.

3184
02:09:38,770 --> 02:09:40,690
We can complain now!

3185
02:09:47,930 --> 02:09:50,230
Are you guys lagging hard or are you guys okay?

3186
02:09:50,370 --> 02:09:51,930
I mean, it's 130 MS, of course.

3187
02:09:52,030 --> 02:09:53,150
It's definitely not East.

3188
02:09:53,870 --> 02:09:55,130
Is this South Africa?

3189
02:09:58,350 --> 02:09:59,390
I think it's South Africa.

3190
02:09:59,710 --> 02:10:01,970
I can't Kovacs this.

3191
02:10:01,970 --> 02:10:05,550
I got a shotgun, so just aim at the middle and we'll call it a day.

3192
02:10:06,050 --> 02:10:07,370
I can't Kovacs it.

3193
02:10:07,530 --> 02:10:08,910
They're denying it.

3194
02:10:09,190 --> 02:10:09,690
Yeah.

3195
02:10:13,250 --> 02:10:14,590
It's already over.

3196
02:10:18,710 --> 02:10:19,930
Lagging for the children.

3197
02:10:20,310 --> 02:10:21,230
100 ping!

3198
02:10:21,830 --> 02:10:22,630
Let's go!

3199
02:10:25,130 --> 02:10:26,570
I need a punch.

3200
02:10:27,070 --> 02:10:27,770
I need a punch.

3201
02:10:28,790 --> 02:10:30,130
I don't have bullets for that gummy.

3202
02:10:30,130 --> 02:10:30,450
Alright.

3203
02:10:32,230 --> 02:10:32,990
Here we go.

3204
02:10:33,130 --> 02:10:33,970
It's the only way.

3205
02:10:34,290 --> 02:10:37,030
All I have to do is just hold down my button.

3206
02:10:38,290 --> 02:10:39,210
There you go.

3207
02:10:42,090 --> 02:10:44,010
I'm curious to see your hooks on this thing.

3208
02:10:44,250 --> 02:10:45,010
Yeah, I'm curious.

3209
02:10:45,370 --> 02:10:46,670
Yeah, I'm kind of curious too.

3210
02:10:51,430 --> 02:10:54,610
I couldn't see the orb because your big robot shoulder was in the way.

3211
02:10:54,630 --> 02:10:56,110
If I was on East, I'd be at 100 ping.

3212
02:10:56,230 --> 02:10:59,230
I could steal it.

3213
02:11:01,610 --> 02:11:03,010
I'm scared to get staked here.

3214
02:11:03,090 --> 02:11:04,650
Okay, I got staked.

3215
02:11:05,010 --> 02:11:06,010
They're playing really passive.

3216
02:11:07,550 --> 02:11:10,490
Oh, I needed the sleep dart.

3217
02:11:13,550 --> 02:11:15,350
What do you think you're doing, weirdo?

3218
02:11:15,650 --> 02:11:18,450
Vindicta characters for weenies.

3219
02:11:20,890 --> 02:11:21,350
100%.

3220
02:11:21,350 --> 02:11:23,530
Yeah, I feel like Vindicta is on the enemy team at least.

3221
02:11:24,110 --> 02:11:24,530
You know?

3222
02:11:24,530 --> 02:11:25,990
I agree.

3223
02:11:33,560 --> 02:11:35,820
It's okay, I'm not teleporting this time.

3224
02:11:39,240 --> 02:11:41,880
We're not getting any of our farm, but that's okay.

3225
02:11:44,940 --> 02:11:47,300
Yeah, we don't need creeps, right?

3226
02:11:48,300 --> 02:11:49,560
Yeah, we don't need it.

3227
02:11:51,080 --> 02:11:53,000
I'm pre-firing my laser.

3228
02:11:55,860 --> 02:11:57,260
Oh, that's not good.

3229
02:11:57,260 --> 02:11:59,140
You punched me into the...

3230
02:12:02,960 --> 02:12:04,400
Oh, that's awkward.

3231
02:12:07,920 --> 02:12:08,760
That's awkward.

3232
02:12:09,800 --> 02:12:11,040
That's pretty awkward.

3233
02:12:11,620 --> 02:12:12,460
Oh my god, guys, guys.

3234
02:12:12,620 --> 02:12:13,920
I co-vacced successfully.

3235
02:12:14,080 --> 02:12:14,820
I co-vacced it.

3236
02:12:16,280 --> 02:12:18,180
To be fair, I was...

3237
02:12:18,180 --> 02:12:18,920
Wait, they're diving you.

3238
02:12:20,040 --> 02:12:23,400
I was aiming for a minion, but the minion disappeared.

3239
02:12:23,400 --> 02:12:24,080
Disappeared!

3240
02:12:24,900 --> 02:12:28,520
Oh no, we should have told them to swap.

3241
02:12:31,080 --> 02:12:32,760
I was thinking about it.

3242
02:12:34,040 --> 02:12:36,980
Yeah, King, because we didn't say anything so they're like, they must be okay, right?

3243
02:12:41,240 --> 02:12:43,420
With coordination, this can be deadly.

3244
02:12:44,160 --> 02:12:45,000
We're the children, guys.

3245
02:12:45,040 --> 02:12:45,660
We're gonna lag.

3246
02:12:45,800 --> 02:12:46,480
Do it for them.

3247
02:12:47,340 --> 02:12:48,360
No, no, it's good.

3248
02:12:48,440 --> 02:12:48,740
It's good.

3249
02:12:48,800 --> 02:12:49,980
We might not make it today, too.

3250
02:12:49,980 --> 02:12:53,060
Oh, Fork, I forgot how small my hook was.

3251
02:12:53,080 --> 02:12:53,820
That is good.

3252
02:12:55,040 --> 02:12:58,760
Because one of our players has to survive a hurricane anyway.

3253
02:12:59,680 --> 02:13:02,100
Stop talking about it like that!

3254
02:13:07,000 --> 02:13:07,600
Yeowch!

3255
02:13:11,320 --> 02:13:12,940
I'm so scared of getting punched.

3256
02:13:14,620 --> 02:13:18,180
I wanna buy.

3257
02:13:18,320 --> 02:13:18,760
I'm buying.

3258
02:13:18,760 --> 02:13:20,100
Alright, alright.

3259
02:13:21,160 --> 02:13:21,960
Good comms.

3260
02:13:23,320 --> 02:13:25,980
Okay, I don't know what to do for my build here.

3261
02:13:26,140 --> 02:13:28,720
Okay, and then ult, and then one, two.

3262
02:13:28,840 --> 02:13:29,020
Okay.

3263
02:13:31,560 --> 02:13:32,740
How ahead of them are they?

3264
02:13:34,700 --> 02:13:35,540
I'll take the shot!

3265
02:13:36,580 --> 02:13:37,880
When she has ult, though, I can't stay.

3266
02:13:38,500 --> 02:13:40,380
How ahead of their farm are they from us?

3267
02:13:40,520 --> 02:13:40,960
Oh, they are.

3268
02:13:43,400 --> 02:13:44,440
They're pretty ahead.

3269
02:13:57,240 --> 02:13:57,620
Hey, listen.

3270
02:13:58,280 --> 02:13:58,960
Oh, he's in ult.

3271
02:13:59,120 --> 02:14:00,020
Oh, no.

3272
02:14:00,720 --> 02:14:01,680
I'm listening, I'm listening.

3273
02:14:03,240 --> 02:14:03,600
Nice.

3274
02:14:03,960 --> 02:14:04,480
Oh, yes, got it!

3275
02:14:05,280 --> 02:14:06,500
Okay, okay.

3276
02:14:07,120 --> 02:14:08,840
Wow, that hit me.

3277
02:14:09,860 --> 02:14:11,500
I fucking believed in you guys.

3278
02:14:12,300 --> 02:14:13,200
Wait, hook her into the tower.

3279
02:14:13,640 --> 02:14:13,860
Oh.

3280
02:14:16,760 --> 02:14:18,020
I put a bomb on her.

3281
02:14:18,800 --> 02:14:19,480
Nice, nice.

3282
02:14:19,480 --> 02:14:19,860
Did you do anything?

3283
02:14:20,220 --> 02:14:20,920
That was actually pretty good.

3284
02:14:21,020 --> 02:14:23,960
The bomb didn't go off.

3285
02:14:23,960 --> 02:14:24,620
Oh, okay.

3286
02:14:24,760 --> 02:14:25,420
That's okay, it's okay.

3287
02:14:25,520 --> 02:14:26,860
It's the thought that counts, you know?

3288
02:14:27,680 --> 02:14:28,700
It's the thought that counts.

3289
02:14:28,980 --> 02:14:31,580
It gave them a sense of...

3290
02:14:32,260 --> 02:14:33,100
Oh, shit.

3291
02:14:33,360 --> 02:14:35,540
The sense of...

3292
02:14:35,540 --> 02:14:36,860
They're scared now.

3293
02:14:37,460 --> 02:14:38,440
They're so scared.

3294
02:14:39,420 --> 02:14:39,800
Excuse me.

3295
02:14:43,040 --> 02:14:45,400
God, I feel so fucking weak like a little baby.

3296
02:14:47,220 --> 02:14:50,260
After playing Abrams, I don't know what I am anymore.

3297
02:14:50,380 --> 02:14:51,340
Oh, I'm so low.

3298
02:14:51,340 --> 02:14:52,060
I have ult.

3299
02:14:52,700 --> 02:14:54,160
Okay, nice.

3300
02:14:54,260 --> 02:14:54,780
Oh, she's on me.

3301
02:14:55,000 --> 02:14:55,200
Do me.

3302
02:14:56,020 --> 02:14:56,500
Boom!

3303
02:15:00,700 --> 02:15:02,340
Oh, even in the lag.

3304
02:15:08,140 --> 02:15:10,140
The lag undid my bomb?

3305
02:15:10,620 --> 02:15:11,540
Wait, what?

3306
02:15:11,860 --> 02:15:12,520
It does that?

3307
02:15:15,580 --> 02:15:16,720
We're gaming now, though.

3308
02:15:16,740 --> 02:15:18,480
We're gaming, we're gaming.

3309
02:15:18,940 --> 02:15:21,080
This feels worse than the first game for me.

3310
02:15:21,080 --> 02:15:22,000
I think gank blue.

3311
02:15:22,380 --> 02:15:22,740
Really?

3312
02:15:26,080 --> 02:15:27,620
Wait, you're in US East.

3313
02:15:28,600 --> 02:15:29,120
Yeah, I don't know.

3314
02:15:30,200 --> 02:15:31,080
That's crazy.

3315
02:15:32,100 --> 02:15:34,540
I had 180 ping, now I'm at 120.

3316
02:15:35,280 --> 02:15:36,160
I'm tethered!

3317
02:15:37,840 --> 02:15:39,360
That should not be possible.

3318
02:15:40,180 --> 02:15:42,660
Don't worry, CJ, I'll cast a bomb upon you.

3319
02:15:43,160 --> 02:15:43,700
Oh, thank you.

3320
02:15:44,200 --> 02:15:45,020
How much do you have, Ramblin?

3321
02:15:45,660 --> 02:15:46,180
111.

3322
02:15:46,640 --> 02:15:50,500
Yeah, so this is EU for sure.

3323
02:15:50,780 --> 02:15:51,920
Yeah, no, 100%.

3324
02:15:51,920 --> 02:15:53,000
I have 130.

3325
02:15:54,140 --> 02:15:55,060
I have 150.

3326
02:15:57,700 --> 02:15:59,300
Like, this cannot be East.

3327
02:16:04,170 --> 02:16:06,470
This could be East in our dreams.

3328
02:16:07,510 --> 02:16:09,650
If we close our eyes.

3329
02:16:09,650 --> 02:16:10,710
Wait, wait, wait.

3330
02:16:10,770 --> 02:16:19,590
This feels like nothing changed at all.

3331
02:16:19,950 --> 02:16:22,330
Okay, I'll farm now.

3332
02:16:22,650 --> 02:16:24,250
I had to look at my build and stuff.

3333
02:16:24,370 --> 02:16:25,230
I got confused.

3334
02:16:29,090 --> 02:16:30,030
Abrams is blue!

3335
02:16:30,330 --> 02:16:31,650
Oh, Abram is blue.

3336
02:16:32,010 --> 02:16:32,710
I'm here with you.

3337
02:16:32,950 --> 02:16:33,610
I look back.

3338
02:16:35,710 --> 02:16:37,450
Okay, I'm gonna...

3339
02:16:42,650 --> 02:16:43,670
I'm farming, I'm farming.

3340
02:16:43,850 --> 02:16:44,830
Please don't let me die.

3341
02:16:45,810 --> 02:16:48,110
I'll be honest, I was trying to hit the minion the entire time.

3342
02:16:49,790 --> 02:16:50,750
Is there healing in there?

3343
02:16:51,190 --> 02:16:52,390
I'm gonna go do my account.

3344
02:16:53,510 --> 02:16:55,510
I accidentally went downstairs and now I'm scared.

3345
02:16:59,570 --> 02:17:01,270
Now I have to go the long way home.

3346
02:17:07,850 --> 02:17:08,890
Is Talon in blue?

3347
02:17:10,830 --> 02:17:12,170
Yeah, I think Talon is in blue.

3348
02:17:14,570 --> 02:17:16,990
I need you back here.

3349
02:17:17,270 --> 02:17:18,750
I'm heading back, I'm heading back.

3350
02:17:18,830 --> 02:17:19,770
I'm heading back to you now.

3351
02:17:21,570 --> 02:17:27,790
I'm gonna go buy stuff.

3352
02:17:27,810 --> 02:17:28,510
I can't hook!

3353
02:17:29,670 --> 02:17:30,710
You can.

3354
02:17:30,930 --> 02:17:31,910
I believe in you.

3355
02:17:32,730 --> 02:17:33,370
I'm here.

3356
02:17:35,430 --> 02:17:36,650
On the map.

3357
02:17:37,430 --> 02:17:38,990
Oh my god!

3358
02:17:39,390 --> 02:17:40,390
Talon is back in purple.

3359
02:17:41,410 --> 02:17:42,110
Oh nice, nice.

3360
02:17:43,190 --> 02:17:44,690
I'll get on the side, I'll force him out.

3361
02:17:47,650 --> 02:17:48,650
He's one.

3362
02:17:58,170 --> 02:17:58,670
Oh!

3363
02:18:04,390 --> 02:18:05,650
Oh my god!

3364
02:18:06,190 --> 02:18:06,790
You slept the Wraith.

3365
02:18:07,070 --> 02:18:09,630
I backed up.

3366
02:18:10,490 --> 02:18:11,510
Wraith is kinda terrible.

3367
02:18:12,110 --> 02:18:13,690
Wraith is low, Wraith is so low.

3368
02:18:14,510 --> 02:18:16,070
He's fine, he's dead, he's dead, he's dead.

3369
02:18:16,850 --> 02:18:18,270
He's in the tower.

3370
02:18:18,910 --> 02:18:20,030
I'll go to purple.

3371
02:18:21,210 --> 02:18:22,110
I'm heading over.

3372
02:18:23,830 --> 02:18:25,770
I will play as safe as I can.

3373
02:18:26,550 --> 02:18:27,670
Oh, you're good, we have a lead.

3374
02:18:29,610 --> 02:18:30,710
We got this.

3375
02:18:31,750 --> 02:18:32,310
I believe.

3376
02:18:33,270 --> 02:18:34,150
Wait, actually...

3377
02:18:34,890 --> 02:18:36,030
Wait, what the fuck?

3378
02:18:36,030 --> 02:18:37,190
I got a Vindicta on me.

3379
02:18:37,730 --> 02:18:39,630
I'm gonna buy a fucking knockdown, you bitch.

3380
02:18:39,730 --> 02:18:40,630
If you do this again.

3381
02:18:49,450 --> 02:18:51,270
I swear to god, I will...

3382
02:18:51,270 --> 02:18:53,590
I will fucking buy a knockdown.

3383
02:18:54,270 --> 02:18:56,410
If you do that to me one more time.

3384
02:18:58,210 --> 02:18:58,650
Oh,

3385
02:19:03,480 --> 02:19:04,320
there's three, there's three.

3386
02:19:04,320 --> 02:19:05,540
Wait, three or two?

3387
02:19:07,340 --> 02:19:08,220
I'm in the area.

3388
02:19:08,720 --> 02:19:09,980
I'm gonna try to fight them.

3389
02:19:11,080 --> 02:19:12,220
I'm by myself right now.

3390
02:19:12,240 --> 02:19:12,900
They don't know I'm on the bridge.

3391
02:19:14,860 --> 02:19:15,780
Yeah, I'm by myself.

3392
02:19:15,920 --> 02:19:16,680
I'm going on Wraith.

3393
02:19:19,760 --> 02:19:20,460
I'm here with you.

3394
02:19:21,360 --> 02:19:22,000
Wraith is one.

3395
02:19:23,140 --> 02:19:23,980
Yeah, Wraith is so low.

3396
02:19:24,580 --> 02:19:25,200
I'm gonna grab the yellow.

3397
02:19:25,280 --> 02:19:25,520
Nice.

3398
02:19:25,520 --> 02:19:26,380
Oh, she fucked up her TP.

3399
02:19:34,190 --> 02:19:34,730
Oh.

3400
02:19:35,730 --> 02:19:36,270
Nice.

3401
02:19:37,810 --> 02:19:38,550
They bursted her left.

3402
02:19:38,890 --> 02:19:39,790
He's heading to you.

3403
02:19:40,270 --> 02:19:41,370
Whoever is over there.

3404
02:19:42,810 --> 02:19:43,890
Me and him are fighting.

3405
02:19:45,910 --> 02:19:47,150
Oh, he fucking left.

3406
02:19:47,370 --> 02:19:47,630
Oh.

3407
02:19:50,850 --> 02:19:51,390
Sorry.

3408
02:19:54,930 --> 02:19:56,770
Thanks for the farm, I guess.

3409
02:20:02,570 --> 02:20:03,510
Oh, shit.

3410
02:20:03,630 --> 02:20:04,010
Goodbye.

3411
02:20:05,010 --> 02:20:07,010
I can't, I got tethered, I got tethered.

3412
02:20:08,830 --> 02:20:09,270
Yeah,

3413
02:20:12,490 --> 02:20:13,290
I'm fucking leaving.

3414
02:20:23,390 --> 02:20:25,290
I'm coming over to green.

3415
02:20:25,550 --> 02:20:26,530
You guys need help in green?

3416
02:20:27,230 --> 02:20:27,650
Oh, okay.

3417
02:20:28,690 --> 02:20:30,210
I guess I'll come back to blue.

3418
02:20:30,410 --> 02:20:31,450
They're coming to push blue tower.

3419
02:20:31,910 --> 02:20:33,370
Yeah, I'm back in blue now.

3420
02:20:33,710 --> 02:20:34,090
I'm here.

3421
02:20:35,030 --> 02:20:35,970
Goodbye, blue.

3422
02:20:37,730 --> 02:20:38,590
I'm here, blue.

3423
02:20:43,770 --> 02:20:45,970
I did not mean to hook you at all, CGM.

3424
02:20:46,330 --> 02:20:46,750
It's okay.

3425
02:20:47,550 --> 02:20:48,370
Life goes on.

3426
02:20:49,770 --> 02:20:51,710
It really does, doesn't it?

3427
02:20:51,790 --> 02:20:53,090
Life goes on.

3428
02:20:53,090 --> 02:20:54,290
It's always fine.

3429
02:20:57,350 --> 02:20:59,270
No, it's like, it's all good.

3430
02:21:02,910 --> 02:21:04,170
There's a Wraith near me.

3431
02:21:05,230 --> 02:21:06,710
I'll try to look silly.

3432
02:21:07,730 --> 02:21:08,390
There's a Wraith here.

3433
02:21:08,830 --> 02:21:11,390
How am I gonna hook you when you look like that?

3434
02:21:11,750 --> 02:21:12,510
You can hold this.

3435
02:21:12,810 --> 02:21:13,670
I'll just get a buy and leave.

3436
02:21:14,850 --> 02:21:15,570
Is there someone there, purple?

3437
02:21:16,750 --> 02:21:18,950
There was Paradox, but she's gone.

3438
02:21:19,510 --> 02:21:21,150
Abrams is here on green.

3439
02:21:21,510 --> 02:21:22,330
Wait, there's...

3440
02:21:22,890 --> 02:21:23,770
Yeah, I'm coming over to blue.

3441
02:21:23,850 --> 02:21:24,450
I need help.

3442
02:21:27,470 --> 02:21:28,550
I have two on me.

3443
02:21:28,610 --> 02:21:29,270
I have two on blue.

3444
02:21:29,650 --> 02:21:31,230
Yeah, I'm pulling up.

3445
02:21:32,350 --> 02:21:32,970
Okay, I'm heading over.

3446
02:21:33,230 --> 02:21:33,710
Can you swap?

3447
02:21:35,610 --> 02:21:37,670
I slept, I slept, I slept, I slept!

3448
02:21:38,850 --> 02:21:40,950
I may be dead though from that, but...

3449
02:21:41,570 --> 02:21:42,750
Oh, I slept the Wraith.

3450
02:21:43,190 --> 02:21:43,950
Oh, we didn't get her.

3451
02:21:44,390 --> 02:21:45,290
Nice, nice, nice.

3452
02:21:45,290 --> 02:21:46,750
Talon's about to be there.

3453
02:21:47,670 --> 02:21:49,390
I'm dead to this, I think.

3454
02:21:52,370 --> 02:21:53,250
The ping.

3455
02:21:53,750 --> 02:21:54,590
Makes it so hard to ping.

3456
02:21:58,630 --> 02:21:59,670
One, two...

3457
02:21:59,670 --> 02:22:01,490
One, five...

3458
02:22:01,490 --> 02:22:01,730
Okay.

3459
02:22:03,690 --> 02:22:05,290
Alright, I just need...

3460
02:22:07,810 --> 02:22:08,790
Coming back.

3461
02:22:09,470 --> 02:22:10,010
Where should I go?

3462
02:22:10,550 --> 02:22:13,590
Yeah, we should shove in everything else, basically.

3463
02:22:13,590 --> 02:22:14,290
Okay.

3464
02:22:14,550 --> 02:22:15,510
Get that green tower.

3465
02:22:17,010 --> 02:22:18,490
Yeah, I was gonna say.

3466
02:22:19,770 --> 02:22:21,010
I'm at green, I'm at green now.

3467
02:22:21,090 --> 02:22:21,950
I'm here, I'm here.

3468
02:22:26,380 --> 02:22:27,380
I'm here with you.

3469
02:22:30,140 --> 02:22:31,560
No one on the right side of the map.

3470
02:22:33,000 --> 02:22:34,500
Yeah, I can go shove in.

3471
02:22:34,800 --> 02:22:35,500
Can we get the green tower?

3472
02:22:35,740 --> 02:22:36,460
I'm over right now.

3473
02:22:37,540 --> 02:22:39,220
I can maybe push this walker.

3474
02:22:40,040 --> 02:22:40,400
Nice.

3475
02:22:41,460 --> 02:22:42,500
Get that buff as well.

3476
02:22:42,500 --> 02:22:44,040
Oh, right here.

3477
02:22:45,020 --> 02:22:45,960
I think it's killable.

3478
02:22:48,060 --> 02:22:49,700
She was not.

3479
02:22:52,300 --> 02:22:53,240
They have a lot of people.

3480
02:22:56,780 --> 02:22:57,540
Oh,

3481
02:23:01,060 --> 02:23:01,320
no.

3482
02:23:03,620 --> 02:23:04,380
No.

3483
02:23:06,180 --> 02:23:07,580
Eat hot chips.

3484
02:23:07,580 --> 02:23:11,140
I'm gonna grab this farm real fast.

3485
02:23:13,340 --> 02:23:13,900
Where are you, green?

3486
02:23:15,100 --> 02:23:16,180
Yeah, I see two in green.

3487
02:23:17,000 --> 02:23:17,860
They're heading to yellow.

3488
02:23:18,020 --> 02:23:19,260
Oh, yeah, they're heading to you.

3489
02:23:19,600 --> 02:23:23,720
My senses are honed.

3490
02:23:27,260 --> 02:23:27,620
I'm deaf.

3491
02:23:28,860 --> 02:23:30,340
It's about to get sticky.

3492
02:23:30,580 --> 02:23:31,200
I'm pretty low.

3493
02:23:32,160 --> 02:23:32,780
Where are they?

3494
02:23:32,940 --> 02:23:33,500
I see them.

3495
02:23:33,620 --> 02:23:34,020
They're right here.

3496
02:23:34,180 --> 02:23:34,500
I'm pretty bad.

3497
02:23:34,600 --> 02:23:35,500
I pushed the walker.

3498
02:23:35,520 --> 02:23:35,980
The walker's half.

3499
02:23:36,060 --> 02:23:36,720
He ran to this one.

3500
02:23:38,360 --> 02:23:39,080
Careful, I'm...

3501
02:23:39,080 --> 02:23:40,680
Oh, I...

3502
02:23:40,680 --> 02:23:43,040
I don't have the life steal for that yet.

3503
02:23:43,400 --> 02:23:43,940
Oh, no.

3504
02:23:44,320 --> 02:23:45,040
He's coming to me.

3505
02:23:45,140 --> 02:23:45,720
He's coming to me.

3506
02:23:45,920 --> 02:23:46,480
I can stall.

3507
02:23:48,860 --> 02:23:49,300
Yeah.

3508
02:23:50,980 --> 02:23:51,420
Nice.

3509
02:23:53,020 --> 02:23:53,640
He's half.

3510
02:23:53,740 --> 02:23:54,020
He's half.

3511
02:23:56,520 --> 02:23:57,320
That was bad.

3512
02:23:58,840 --> 02:23:59,720
He's one.

3513
02:23:59,840 --> 02:24:00,000
He's one.

3514
02:24:00,020 --> 02:24:00,360
He's one.

3515
02:24:02,040 --> 02:24:02,480
Nice.

3516
02:24:03,620 --> 02:24:05,380
I think I got both of these walkers.

3517
02:24:06,920 --> 02:24:07,600
Yeah, I'm...

3518
02:24:07,600 --> 02:24:08,580
I'm not dipping.

3519
02:24:09,000 --> 02:24:10,960
There's a dynamo here.

3520
02:24:15,300 --> 02:24:17,060
I'm gonna try to defend this tower, but...

3521
02:24:17,060 --> 02:24:18,800
I'm a little low.

3522
02:24:19,020 --> 02:24:20,820
I'm dead as fuck.

3523
02:24:25,740 --> 02:24:26,820
This is a terrible ult by me.

3524
02:24:27,780 --> 02:24:28,800
I have a dynamo on me.

3525
02:24:29,880 --> 02:24:30,220
Teleporting.

3526
02:24:30,640 --> 02:24:30,880
Coming.

3527
02:24:32,520 --> 02:24:33,120
I have two.

3528
02:24:33,160 --> 02:24:33,380
I have two.

3529
02:24:33,460 --> 02:24:33,800
I have two on me.

3530
02:24:33,980 --> 02:24:34,680
You have a lot on you.

3531
02:24:35,440 --> 02:24:36,440
Oh, more than two?

3532
02:24:36,560 --> 02:24:37,520
Oh, that's...

3533
02:24:37,520 --> 02:24:38,980
Oh, I...

3534
02:24:40,060 --> 02:24:40,840
I didn't realize.

3535
02:24:42,060 --> 02:24:43,160
Yeah, you have to back up fully.

3536
02:24:43,260 --> 02:24:43,840
I need heal.

3537
02:24:47,240 --> 02:24:48,320
This is the last one they need.

3538
02:24:49,700 --> 02:24:50,200
Oooo!

3539
02:24:51,860 --> 02:24:52,860
I'm alive!

3540
02:24:54,620 --> 02:24:55,620
I'm alive!

3541
02:24:57,620 --> 02:25:01,140
I can be there in like 30 seconds with really good buy.

3542
02:25:01,820 --> 02:25:02,260
Okay.

3543
02:25:05,420 --> 02:25:06,500
Where should I go?

3544
02:25:06,760 --> 02:25:09,740
Should I go to...

3545
02:25:11,720 --> 02:25:13,200
I'm gonna be behind this Wraith.

3546
02:25:13,800 --> 02:25:14,500
I'm gonna go for Walker.

3547
02:25:15,160 --> 02:25:16,720
I have a Wraith on me.

3548
02:25:20,080 --> 02:25:21,520
I'm heading over to you.

3549
02:25:21,720 --> 02:25:22,420
Paradox is one.

3550
02:25:23,740 --> 02:25:24,560
Vindictus is on me also.

3551
02:25:24,800 --> 02:25:25,820
Oh, I got her.

3552
02:25:27,260 --> 02:25:28,280
I'm helping you.

3553
02:25:28,300 --> 02:25:28,840
Vindictus is low.

3554
02:25:30,100 --> 02:25:31,720
I'm on my way towards that fight.

3555
02:25:32,020 --> 02:25:35,980
I got lag-eated away.

3556
02:25:36,080 --> 02:25:36,460
I'm sorry.

3557
02:25:36,640 --> 02:25:37,060
Paradox here.

3558
02:25:39,620 --> 02:25:40,680
One HP of Paradox.

3559
02:25:40,980 --> 02:25:41,520
I'm heading over.

3560
02:25:42,200 --> 02:25:43,680
I have ult, so I can help.

3561
02:25:45,460 --> 02:25:48,380
Oh, nice.

3562
02:25:53,420 --> 02:25:54,620
They're doing it!

3563
02:25:57,880 --> 02:25:59,700
I'm just like that.

3564
02:25:59,720 --> 02:26:00,820
Coach is happy.

3565
02:26:05,840 --> 02:26:07,360
Oh, I slept the creep.

3566
02:26:08,140 --> 02:26:09,080
Huge, huge, huge.

3567
02:26:09,080 --> 02:26:11,100
That creep is really tired.

3568
02:26:11,420 --> 02:26:11,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3569
02:26:12,040 --> 02:26:12,760
He's EP now.

3570
02:26:14,360 --> 02:26:18,060
Oh, you guys scared the shit out of me there.

3571
02:26:18,800 --> 02:26:19,880
I'm gonna steal their shop too.

3572
02:26:20,760 --> 02:26:21,720
Oh, damn.

3573
02:26:21,840 --> 02:26:23,100
Steal their shop.

3574
02:26:23,100 --> 02:26:24,140
Yeah, that's very...

3575
02:26:24,140 --> 02:26:26,020
You said that earlier, and I was like, hmm.

3576
02:26:26,240 --> 02:26:27,180
You just mean shop at it?

3577
02:26:29,340 --> 02:26:30,440
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

3578
02:26:31,880 --> 02:26:32,620
I'm dipping.

3579
02:26:32,820 --> 02:26:33,460
I think I'm okay.

3580
02:26:35,280 --> 02:26:36,860
Oh, they're fucking heading over.

3581
02:26:37,880 --> 02:26:39,540
There's an Abrams to my left, by the way.

3582
02:26:40,540 --> 02:26:43,180
Oh, there's so many people over there.

3583
02:26:44,720 --> 02:26:46,080
I'm heading over to you.

3584
02:26:48,700 --> 02:26:49,820
I may be running.

3585
02:26:52,200 --> 02:26:53,160
Are we gonna fight?

3586
02:26:53,480 --> 02:26:55,660
There's a granny over there.

3587
02:26:56,340 --> 02:26:57,220
I'm coming, I'm coming.

3588
02:26:57,280 --> 02:26:59,040
I'm here, I'm here, I'm here, I'm here.

3589
02:27:01,460 --> 02:27:02,740
Oh, he fucking hooked me.

3590
02:27:02,840 --> 02:27:03,100
No!

3591
02:27:04,300 --> 02:27:05,300
Me too, me too.

3592
02:27:06,780 --> 02:27:06,980
Okay.

3593
02:27:07,840 --> 02:27:08,760
There's an Abrams right here.

3594
02:27:12,440 --> 02:27:15,040
As long as Ramblin survives all is well.

3595
02:27:15,380 --> 02:27:15,720
No.

3596
02:27:16,960 --> 02:27:18,980
Oh, I'm getting chased by Abrams.

3597
02:27:20,840 --> 02:27:21,960
He's on me, Abrams.

3598
02:27:24,140 --> 02:27:24,700
Alright.

3599
02:27:26,160 --> 02:27:27,300
I have to go back.

3600
02:27:28,760 --> 02:27:31,000
I'll never die.

3601
02:27:32,460 --> 02:27:33,900
I need to go back.

3602
02:27:33,980 --> 02:27:34,560
I'm solo.

3603
02:27:38,740 --> 02:27:41,800
I'm like fucking gonna die.

3604
02:27:41,940 --> 02:27:42,900
Okay, I'm gonna save for Ricochet.

3605
02:27:45,860 --> 02:27:46,420
Woah.

3606
02:27:46,420 --> 02:27:46,580
Woah.

3607
02:27:48,800 --> 02:27:49,700
This is it.

3608
02:27:49,740 --> 02:27:50,650
It's Ricochet time.

3609
02:27:51,760 --> 02:27:52,480
Nice.

3610
02:27:53,920 --> 02:27:54,660
Okay.

3611
02:27:55,860 --> 02:27:57,020
Oh, nice.

3612
02:28:00,560 --> 02:28:02,160
Oh, three green.

3613
02:28:03,380 --> 02:28:04,280
I'm heading over.

3614
02:28:04,460 --> 02:28:06,010
We have Blast and Bebop.

3615
02:28:07,280 --> 02:28:09,040
I haven't hit a single hook.

3616
02:28:09,040 --> 02:28:10,400
They're going for the tower.

3617
02:28:10,400 --> 02:28:11,000
Woah.

3618
02:28:12,160 --> 02:28:13,080
I'm here.

3619
02:28:14,200 --> 02:28:15,420
I'll be late.

3620
02:28:15,420 --> 02:28:16,400
He's late.

3621
02:28:17,340 --> 02:28:18,000
He's one.

3622
02:28:23,540 --> 02:28:24,580
Go, Bebop.

3623
02:28:24,680 --> 02:28:24,900
Go.

3624
02:28:25,160 --> 02:28:26,000
Go, Bebop.

3625
02:28:26,120 --> 02:28:26,360
Go.

3626
02:28:28,600 --> 02:28:29,260
Are you mid?

3627
02:28:37,960 --> 02:28:38,620
Yeah, that's true.

3628
02:28:38,700 --> 02:28:39,480
They don't have a shop anymore.

3629
02:28:39,620 --> 02:28:39,960
It's stolen.

3630
02:28:42,720 --> 02:28:43,500
I'm here.

3631
02:28:43,500 --> 02:28:43,540
I'm here.

3632
02:28:45,800 --> 02:28:47,220
I have to be in the fucking pit.

3633
02:28:49,100 --> 02:28:49,760
Who's parrying?

3634
02:28:50,520 --> 02:28:51,220
I can parry.

3635
02:28:52,880 --> 02:28:53,580
Don't worry.

3636
02:28:54,480 --> 02:28:55,240
Alright, parry gang.

3637
02:28:56,980 --> 02:28:57,440
Parrying.

3638
02:28:59,660 --> 02:29:00,660
We got it.

3639
02:29:00,700 --> 02:29:02,360
Okay, I was gonna say, did we get it?

3640
02:29:06,060 --> 02:29:07,820
I think I killed somebody.

3641
02:29:12,240 --> 02:29:12,680
Nice.

3642
02:29:14,260 --> 02:29:15,500
Yellow lane needs help.

3643
02:29:18,300 --> 02:29:19,320
I'm heading over.

3644
02:29:19,960 --> 02:29:20,060
Oh.

3645
02:29:23,020 --> 02:29:23,680
You're gaming.

3646
02:29:24,000 --> 02:29:25,060
Oh, I might be dead.

3647
02:29:25,640 --> 02:29:26,320
It's okay though.

3648
02:29:26,360 --> 02:29:27,040
We can get the Paradox.

3649
02:29:28,460 --> 02:29:29,700
Did we get him?

3650
02:29:30,380 --> 02:29:31,380
Nah, I fried him.

3651
02:29:33,720 --> 02:29:35,120
We can just take the tower.

3652
02:29:35,120 --> 02:29:35,680
Yeah.

3653
02:29:38,820 --> 02:29:39,320
Yippee!

3654
02:29:41,620 --> 02:29:43,620
Oh shit.

3655
02:29:44,120 --> 02:29:45,120
I'm gonna get for the other tower.

3656
02:29:45,660 --> 02:29:47,040
Both your towers, I guess.

3657
02:29:49,500 --> 02:29:50,500
Goodbye.

3658
02:29:55,210 --> 02:29:55,750
Goodbye.

3659
02:29:56,350 --> 02:29:58,070
I can go get purple.

3660
02:30:00,010 --> 02:30:01,010
Alright.

3661
02:30:03,210 --> 02:30:05,450
I'm gonna go farm.

3662
02:30:05,450 --> 02:30:07,510
I'll see you guys later.

3663
02:30:07,770 --> 02:30:08,250
I'll come back.

3664
02:30:08,490 --> 02:30:09,130
I'll get the urn.

3665
02:30:10,670 --> 02:30:12,930
Hey, I wanted to farm this.

3666
02:30:15,190 --> 02:30:17,090
We can farm together.

3667
02:30:17,590 --> 02:30:18,530
Come down here.

3668
02:30:19,090 --> 02:30:19,390
Yeah.

3669
02:30:20,950 --> 02:30:21,550
Come here.

3670
02:30:22,670 --> 02:30:23,810
There you go.

3671
02:30:26,170 --> 02:30:26,530
Hello.

3672
02:30:27,530 --> 02:30:29,010
Is that Talon near me?

3673
02:30:29,130 --> 02:30:30,290
Oh, I have a Wraith too.

3674
02:30:30,690 --> 02:30:33,490
I have somebody else.

3675
02:30:33,490 --> 02:30:35,090
Oh my god, they love me.

3676
02:30:35,570 --> 02:30:39,090
You just wanna be sure you're included, you know?

3677
02:30:39,570 --> 02:30:41,950
I'm saying, thank you, enemy team.

3678
02:30:42,750 --> 02:30:44,330
Paradox, it's Paradox for me.

3679
02:30:46,430 --> 02:30:47,230
Where'd he go?

3680
02:30:48,470 --> 02:30:49,750
Oh, I'm solo Blackhold.

3681
02:30:50,030 --> 02:30:51,650
It's vibes though, honestly.

3682
02:30:52,310 --> 02:30:53,030
You guys be okay?

3683
02:30:55,410 --> 02:30:56,370
I'm Q-Bert.

3684
02:30:56,530 --> 02:30:57,010
Oh, nice.

3685
02:30:57,770 --> 02:30:59,390
Q-Bert mode?

3686
02:30:59,750 --> 02:31:00,830
Paradox is my hero.

3687
02:31:01,650 --> 02:31:03,290
Oh my god, I'm so close to a Ricochet.

3688
02:31:03,430 --> 02:31:04,890
Please live for like 5 seconds.

3689
02:31:07,190 --> 02:31:08,830
Oh my god, I got it.

3690
02:31:12,770 --> 02:31:14,050
I'm gonna use the boost.

3691
02:31:14,470 --> 02:31:16,010
That's how desperate I want the Ricochet.

3692
02:31:16,970 --> 02:31:17,870
Where is this guy?

3693
02:31:19,450 --> 02:31:20,130
Okay, I'm heading over.

3694
02:31:20,530 --> 02:31:22,530
I worked hard for that Ramblin'.

3695
02:31:23,290 --> 02:31:24,070
I'm speeding!

3696
02:31:31,620 --> 02:31:32,560
Wait, where did he go?

3697
02:31:32,560 --> 02:31:34,880
He's so low.

3698
02:31:35,100 --> 02:31:36,600
Oh, that guy bamboozled.

3699
02:31:36,800 --> 02:31:37,500
He got a DPR.

3700
02:31:39,740 --> 02:31:40,660
Nice.

3701
02:31:41,300 --> 02:31:42,840
Off we go.

3702
02:31:46,820 --> 02:31:47,740
Nice.

3703
02:31:54,100 --> 02:31:55,700
Off we go.

3704
02:31:56,460 --> 02:31:57,640
My team is just decoded.

3705
02:31:58,680 --> 02:32:01,660
We didn't need the NA ping, guys.

3706
02:32:01,940 --> 02:32:03,540
We didn't need it.

3707
02:32:04,240 --> 02:32:05,680
We're just gamers.

3708
02:32:06,860 --> 02:32:09,080
No wonder these guys are in loser bracket with us.

3709
02:32:17,440 --> 02:32:19,860
And I mean it.

3710
02:32:26,190 --> 02:32:26,740
He's asleep.

3711
02:32:26,740 --> 02:32:27,540
He's asleep.

3712
02:32:29,060 --> 02:32:29,860
Abrams low.

3713
02:32:32,600 --> 02:32:33,400
What happened?

3714
02:32:34,200 --> 02:32:35,440
Alright, here we go.

3715
02:32:37,720 --> 02:32:39,220
Am I fucking dead?

3716
02:32:39,380 --> 02:32:39,980
Oh shit.

3717
02:32:40,520 --> 02:32:41,320
Who shot?

3718
02:32:41,460 --> 02:32:42,300
Oh, it's the grandpa.

3719
02:32:43,580 --> 02:32:46,300
I was not paying attention.

3720
02:32:46,640 --> 02:32:47,720
I was like, hee hee.

3721
02:32:49,860 --> 02:32:51,120
I believe in you guys.

3722
02:32:51,240 --> 02:32:52,620
I don't even need to be in the endgame.

3723
02:32:56,740 --> 02:32:58,120
I don't even need to be there.

3724
02:32:58,380 --> 02:32:58,780
Yay!

3725
02:33:00,520 --> 02:33:02,060
Alright, so anyway, guys.

3726
02:33:03,140 --> 02:33:04,580
We're going to be at day two.

3727
02:33:04,580 --> 02:33:05,960
That's not who I am as a person.

3728
02:33:06,120 --> 02:33:07,540
That's not who I am as a person.

3729
02:33:07,820 --> 02:33:09,240
I let my anger take over me.

3730
02:33:09,900 --> 02:33:11,820
Guys, we're going to be in day two, guys.

3731
02:33:12,080 --> 02:33:12,440
Unlucky.

3732
02:33:14,200 --> 02:33:16,060
Can we let this team advance instead?

3733
02:33:17,760 --> 02:33:20,440
We should have FFed.

3734
02:33:20,440 --> 02:33:22,120
I think my game just crashed.

3735
02:33:22,160 --> 02:33:24,060
We should have FFed.

3736
02:33:24,720 --> 02:33:25,840
Suffering from success.

3737
02:33:26,500 --> 02:33:27,340
Is it 12pm tomorrow?

3738
02:33:27,600 --> 02:33:29,100
No, it's 6 in the morning.

3739
02:33:29,640 --> 02:33:32,160
No, no, no, I'm not doing it.

3740
02:33:32,340 --> 02:33:35,780
All I'm saying is, thank god my power's out because of the surge.

3741
02:33:36,620 --> 02:33:38,240
I think my power's going to be out too.

3742
02:33:38,800 --> 02:33:39,980
I will not be there.

3743
02:33:40,320 --> 02:33:43,180
Good luck at Doki and Juni at 6am.

3744
02:33:43,180 --> 02:33:44,020
No, I'm not there.

3745
02:33:45,420 --> 02:33:50,040
Guys, you guys, I should have told you guys.

3746
02:33:50,360 --> 02:33:52,240
I didn't think we would make it to day two.

3747
02:33:53,560 --> 02:33:55,200
You know, you got that at 6am.

3748
02:33:55,980 --> 02:33:58,040
Just tell them to advance the other team, man.

3749
02:33:59,120 --> 02:34:00,580
We did it for the kids.

3750
02:34:02,120 --> 02:34:05,500
I will donate to the charity if the other team gets advanced.

3751
02:34:05,800 --> 02:34:06,560
How much though?

3752
02:34:07,040 --> 02:34:08,320
Okay, how much?

3753
02:34:08,880 --> 02:34:09,360
Enough.

3754
02:34:09,360 --> 02:34:09,700
Enough.

3755
02:34:11,380 --> 02:34:12,840
For the kids.

3756
02:34:13,100 --> 02:34:14,620
I'm waiting, I'm refreshing.

3757
02:34:15,300 --> 02:34:17,440
I'm refreshing the charity.

3758
02:34:21,560 --> 02:34:24,600
We'll let the other team play, but they have to be under Team Doki Bird.

3759
02:34:25,280 --> 02:34:26,560
Yeah, yeah, they can play as Doki Bird.

3760
02:34:26,800 --> 02:34:28,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3761
02:34:29,040 --> 02:34:31,580
You have to be under Team Doki Bird.

3762
02:34:33,960 --> 02:34:35,400
No, guys.

3763
02:34:36,140 --> 02:34:36,700
No.

3764
02:34:36,700 --> 02:34:37,300
Okay.

3765
02:34:37,660 --> 02:34:39,740
I don't want to be the messenger though.

3766
02:34:48,600 --> 02:34:50,790
Congrats on making it to day two.

3767
02:34:52,920 --> 02:34:53,820
Wait, okay.

3768
02:34:53,900 --> 02:34:56,580
They said they will avoid having a start at 6.

3769
02:34:57,920 --> 02:34:59,260
Don't say like 6.30.

3770
02:35:00,020 --> 02:35:00,520
7.

3771
02:35:01,860 --> 02:35:04,280
You guys will be the 7am match.

3772
02:35:04,280 --> 02:35:07,840
Waking up at 6.30 to play on 180 ping.

3773
02:35:08,100 --> 02:35:09,760
Okay, how about we negotiate?

3774
02:35:10,560 --> 02:35:11,660
And like...

3775
02:35:12,280 --> 02:35:16,400
If you give us NA servers, we'll be fine.

3776
02:35:17,660 --> 02:35:20,600
I don't want to wake up.

3777
02:35:22,380 --> 02:35:24,580
We made it this far.

3778
02:35:26,900 --> 02:35:28,940
Can't we just advance another team?

3779
02:35:30,140 --> 02:35:30,600
What?

3780
02:35:30,600 --> 02:35:32,840
We can just advance another team, right?

3781
02:35:33,200 --> 02:35:33,720
Yeah.

3782
02:35:36,320 --> 02:35:36,840
What?

3783
02:35:36,840 --> 02:35:37,700
They're typing.

3784
02:35:38,140 --> 02:35:38,720
They're typing.

3785
02:35:44,440 --> 02:35:45,300
They're typing.

3786
02:35:45,480 --> 02:35:46,880
I don't know what they're trying to say.

3787
02:35:48,920 --> 02:35:50,480
I can't believe it.

3788
02:35:50,560 --> 02:35:52,340
I can't believe we made it.

3789
02:35:52,340 --> 02:35:53,100
You didn't believe in us?

3790
02:35:56,480 --> 02:35:58,460
That's because the silence was so loud.

3791
02:35:58,460 --> 02:36:01,740
That was the loudest silence I've ever heard in my life.

3792
02:36:01,820 --> 02:36:02,820
That is insane.

3793
02:36:07,520 --> 02:36:10,200
We're so good at video games, guys.

3794
02:36:11,560 --> 02:36:13,960
We're so good at video games.

3795
02:36:14,340 --> 02:36:15,600
Okay, who is the best at PR?

3796
02:36:15,920 --> 02:36:18,140
I need you guys to type a response for me and I'll copy it.

3797
02:36:19,700 --> 02:36:21,720
Type a PR message for me.

3798
02:36:21,980 --> 02:36:23,840
This guy is literally the face of Chipotle.

3799
02:36:24,960 --> 02:36:25,740
He is.

3800
02:36:26,700 --> 02:36:31,900
I want a bowl with white rice and black beans and chicken.

3801
02:36:32,060 --> 02:36:33,240
Why didn't you just say hey?

3802
02:36:34,720 --> 02:36:35,940
We really appreciate it.

3803
02:36:36,080 --> 02:36:37,540
You know, we love charity.

3804
02:36:38,000 --> 02:36:38,380
Bye!

3805
02:36:41,740 --> 02:36:43,060
Our team's not available.

3806
02:36:43,180 --> 02:36:47,720
We just filled in last minute, but we would love to send another team in our place and donate to Charity Smile.

3807
02:36:47,860 --> 02:36:50,000
Good luck to my boy Raiden portioning in the rain.

3808
02:36:50,000 --> 02:36:51,900
Wait, that's what I was saying.

3809
02:36:55,420 --> 02:36:56,880
I had to write something.

3810
02:36:57,920 --> 02:36:59,280
Oh my god.

3811
02:37:00,320 --> 02:37:00,720
Okay.

3812
02:37:01,820 --> 02:37:02,320
Alright.

3813
02:37:02,840 --> 02:37:04,500
No one can freak it like him in the rain.

3814
02:37:04,600 --> 02:37:05,040
Put that in there.

3815
02:37:05,060 --> 02:37:05,640
That's true.

3816
02:37:05,820 --> 02:37:09,400
I noticed you're drinking a Philz coffee.

3817
02:37:09,580 --> 02:37:09,980
Which order?

3818
02:37:11,160 --> 02:37:13,440
This is a black filtered soul cold brew.

3819
02:37:15,220 --> 02:37:16,620
A black coffee?

3820
02:37:16,700 --> 02:37:18,540
When you're an adult, you'll understand.

3821
02:37:19,600 --> 02:37:20,880
I drink black coffee.

3822
02:37:21,460 --> 02:37:22,900
But I drink black iced coffee.

3823
02:37:23,340 --> 02:37:25,800
I also drink black coffee, except decaf.

3824
02:37:26,000 --> 02:37:26,460
At home.

3825
02:37:27,600 --> 02:37:28,160
Decaf?

3826
02:37:29,500 --> 02:37:30,760
Are you an alien?

3827
02:37:31,980 --> 02:37:32,700
A reptile?

3828
02:37:32,880 --> 02:37:34,780
Wait, cold decaf?

3829
02:37:34,900 --> 02:37:37,080
I get really upset.

3830
02:37:37,840 --> 02:37:39,200
It makes me want to cry.

3831
02:37:39,340 --> 02:37:40,240
And I also vibrate.

3832
02:37:41,400 --> 02:37:42,640
That sounds like a dad.

3833
02:37:42,880 --> 02:37:44,100
That's how I am every day.

3834
02:37:44,100 --> 02:37:44,940
Oh.

3835
02:37:46,500 --> 02:37:47,020
Whoa.

3836
02:37:47,780 --> 02:37:49,480
It's like the Satsui no Hado.

3837
02:37:51,120 --> 02:37:51,640
Okay.

3838
02:37:52,400 --> 02:37:53,880
My chat gets that reference.

3839
02:37:53,980 --> 02:37:54,860
None of you will get that reference.

3840
02:37:54,960 --> 02:37:55,420
That's okay.

3841
02:37:56,680 --> 02:37:58,140
That was for my chat.

3842
02:37:59,160 --> 02:38:00,340
That was for my chat.

3843
02:38:00,860 --> 02:38:02,220
What would you guys understand?

3844
02:38:02,480 --> 02:38:05,540
It's like Sasuke suppressing his curse mark.

3845
02:38:06,100 --> 02:38:06,720
Oh, okay.

3846
02:38:07,840 --> 02:38:09,360
I don't watch anime.

3847
02:38:09,560 --> 02:38:11,260
Can you get me something more normie?

3848
02:38:11,260 --> 02:38:12,380
I don't watch anime.

3849
02:38:13,220 --> 02:38:20,940
It's like when somebody wants to say that Raditz is going to die in a hurricane, but instead they say, like, I hope Raditz does well in the hurricane.

3850
02:38:21,420 --> 02:38:21,900
Oh.

3851
02:38:26,500 --> 02:38:28,560
Now you're speaking my language.

3852
02:38:29,260 --> 02:38:29,960
Right there.

3853
02:38:29,960 --> 02:38:30,720
Uh...

3854
02:38:33,720 --> 02:38:34,060
Yeah.

3855
02:38:37,280 --> 02:38:37,780
Okay, I'm leaving.

3856
02:38:38,140 --> 02:38:41,060
Are you still typing a message?

3857
02:38:41,520 --> 02:38:43,500
I already typed the first message!

3858
02:38:48,000 --> 02:38:48,680
Okay.

3859
02:38:50,220 --> 02:38:51,960
Alright, I said...

3860
02:38:52,680 --> 02:38:53,680
Okay, I'm still typing.

3861
02:39:08,180 --> 02:39:10,000
She's really locked in.

3862
02:39:10,160 --> 02:39:11,440
She's locked in.

3863
02:39:37,200 --> 02:39:38,540
Okay, I said...

3864
02:39:38,540 --> 02:39:42,460
One of them is literally in Hurricane Milton right now, so he won't have power tomorrow.

3865
02:39:43,540 --> 02:39:45,460
He just put it all on red!

3866
02:39:46,200 --> 02:39:47,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3867
02:39:48,380 --> 02:39:50,020
I have to feed my cats.

3868
02:39:50,180 --> 02:39:50,840
Did you mention that?

3869
02:39:52,260 --> 02:39:54,020
I also have to feed Seijin's cats.

3870
02:39:54,320 --> 02:39:55,960
Yeah, me and Ram got to feed my cats.

3871
02:39:56,920 --> 02:39:57,760
That's three down.

3872
02:39:57,940 --> 02:39:58,660
That's three down.

3873
02:39:58,660 --> 02:40:05,000
Yeah, yeah, I said half the team might not be able to make it because it's really early and one of them is literally in Hurricane Milton.

3874
02:40:06,820 --> 02:40:09,040
There's three cats, so I could use one more volunteer.

3875
02:40:09,800 --> 02:40:10,980
Oh, I am down.

3876
02:40:11,120 --> 02:40:11,360
I'm local.

3877
02:40:11,560 --> 02:40:13,140
Okay, so me, Void, and Ramlin got to feed my cats.

3878
02:40:13,180 --> 02:40:13,900
Now we're down to two.

3879
02:40:15,580 --> 02:40:16,760
I got to feed the past you.

3880
02:40:18,020 --> 02:40:19,000
Now it's just Doki.

3881
02:40:19,880 --> 02:40:20,600
Yeah, so...

3882
02:40:20,600 --> 02:40:23,280
And I'm West Coast, and that's...

3883
02:40:23,280 --> 02:40:23,560
Yeah.

3884
02:40:24,540 --> 02:40:24,940
I'm...

3885
02:40:25,860 --> 02:40:26,660
I can't...

3886
02:40:26,660 --> 02:40:29,780
All of us except Ray are West Coast, I think.

3887
02:40:30,140 --> 02:40:31,800
No, don't say that.

3888
02:40:32,160 --> 02:40:36,100
If it's Doki against the enemy team, that's just unfair, you know?

3889
02:40:36,500 --> 02:40:37,480
Like, Doki's just too good.

3890
02:40:37,740 --> 02:40:40,100
I mean, maybe they should just forfeit the rest of the tournament and we win.

3891
02:40:40,180 --> 02:40:41,540
Yeah, and then just Doki wins.

3892
02:40:42,200 --> 02:40:43,140
For the kids.

3893
02:40:44,500 --> 02:40:45,040
For the kids.

3894
02:40:48,760 --> 02:40:49,700
I think that sounds good.

3895
02:40:52,580 --> 02:40:54,340
Okay, they're typing.

3896
02:40:54,820 --> 02:40:55,580
They're trying to...

3897
02:40:56,560 --> 02:40:59,720
They're trying to negotiate with us.

3898
02:41:00,120 --> 02:41:01,200
Yeah, you got that, Doki.

3899
02:41:01,220 --> 02:41:04,420
They said, what about 915 PST?

3900
02:41:04,860 --> 02:41:06,200
They're negotiating.

3901
02:41:06,860 --> 02:41:07,980
I mean, that's the hurricane.

3902
02:41:08,340 --> 02:41:09,120
That's the...

3903
02:41:15,260 --> 02:41:17,720
We're having a negotiation session.

3904
02:41:20,300 --> 02:41:20,980
So...

3905
02:41:20,980 --> 02:41:24,080
915 is off the table for us.

3906
02:41:25,160 --> 02:41:26,580
Is that right?

3907
02:41:28,560 --> 02:41:31,000
I need us to be in advance so we have evidence.

3908
02:41:31,180 --> 02:41:31,420
I need...

3909
02:41:32,700 --> 02:41:34,520
That's why I'm vocalizing.

3910
02:41:40,340 --> 02:41:42,120
We forgot to ask Milton.

3911
02:41:42,520 --> 02:41:44,000
We gotta ask Milton.

3912
02:41:44,400 --> 02:41:46,300
Can you, like, come by later?

3913
02:41:46,300 --> 02:41:47,940
Can you, like, get me a car?

3914
02:41:48,840 --> 02:41:50,080
I got a deadlock, Kearney.

3915
02:41:50,280 --> 02:41:51,660
Can you, like, chow for a couple hours?

3916
02:41:52,180 --> 02:41:54,540
Milton doesn't care about your schedule.

3917
02:42:01,750 --> 02:42:02,150
Milton?

3918
02:42:03,030 --> 02:42:04,130
What do you think, Milton?

3919
02:42:04,350 --> 02:42:05,070
I'm not getting back.

3920
02:42:06,610 --> 02:42:08,130
Who's naming these, by the way?

3921
02:42:08,190 --> 02:42:09,550
I think Milton's ghosting us.

3922
02:42:10,550 --> 02:42:12,350
I don't think I like the name Milton.

3923
02:42:13,170 --> 02:42:15,690
There's, like, a groundhog that comes up and names the hurricanes.

3924
02:42:17,550 --> 02:42:17,950
Really?

3925
02:42:17,950 --> 02:42:18,010
Really?

3926
02:42:19,510 --> 02:42:20,150
Yeah.

3927
02:42:24,400 --> 02:42:25,040
Okay.

3928
02:42:25,440 --> 02:42:29,500
I said, talked with the team, and we think we can't do it.

3929
02:42:29,580 --> 02:42:31,060
Is it possible to...

3930
02:42:31,060 --> 02:42:35,380
Is it possible to advance the other team?

3931
02:42:37,660 --> 02:42:39,020
Put it at 12 p.m.

3932
02:42:39,040 --> 02:42:40,400
or advance another team?

3933
02:42:41,280 --> 02:42:42,560
Hard negotiation.

3934
02:42:43,420 --> 02:42:48,660
Do you think this would be 12 p.m.?

3935
02:42:48,660 --> 02:42:49,360
Or the other group?

3936
02:42:49,880 --> 02:42:50,540
I think so.

3937
02:42:51,000 --> 02:42:51,240
Yeah.

3938
02:42:53,420 --> 02:42:55,280
Maybe 9 p.m.?

3939
02:42:55,280 --> 02:43:00,920
I don't know if it was super duper early, but...

3940
02:43:00,920 --> 02:43:03,880
They at least had, like, a couple-hour buffer before us.

3941
02:43:04,180 --> 02:43:04,460
Yeah.

3942
02:43:04,680 --> 02:43:04,920
Okay.

3943
02:43:05,100 --> 02:43:08,880
I said, talked to this team, and we think we can't do it.

3944
02:43:09,220 --> 02:43:11,960
As the best time will be at 12 p.m.

3945
02:43:12,000 --> 02:43:12,600
for us.

3946
02:43:14,200 --> 02:43:15,340
12 p.m.

3947
02:43:15,340 --> 02:43:17,580
Is it possible to advance the other team?

3948
02:43:17,660 --> 02:43:18,200
I'm sorry.

3949
02:43:19,700 --> 02:43:21,080
I'm sorry.

3950
02:43:21,800 --> 02:43:23,540
Let's tag in Milton.

3951
02:43:24,400 --> 02:43:25,160
Thoughts?

3952
02:43:27,120 --> 02:43:28,300
Team Milton.

3953
02:43:29,000 --> 02:43:31,640
Team Milton, join in the tourney.

3954
02:43:31,660 --> 02:43:33,400
Join the tourney.

3955
02:43:33,920 --> 02:43:34,820
For the kids.

3956
02:43:35,180 --> 02:43:36,240
For the kids.

3957
02:43:42,650 --> 02:43:45,670
Since half the team will be missing...

3958
02:43:47,190 --> 02:43:48,710
Half the team will be missing.

3959
02:43:48,810 --> 02:43:49,130
Okay.

3960
02:43:49,750 --> 02:43:53,330
If it turns out there's a Day 3 to this tournament, I'm gonna scream.

3961
02:43:53,330 --> 02:43:55,270
You said you can't even do Day 2!

3962
02:43:56,110 --> 02:43:57,750
And you're not even gonna be involved!

3963
02:43:58,770 --> 02:44:00,090
We didn't even know there was a Day 2.

3964
02:44:00,190 --> 02:44:01,370
Now there's about to be a Day 4.

3965
02:44:03,110 --> 02:44:04,290
It's a week-long event.

3966
02:44:04,630 --> 02:44:06,290
It's like the Dota International.

3967
02:44:06,590 --> 02:44:08,130
That was my bad.

3968
02:44:08,250 --> 02:44:11,330
I didn't think we would make it to Day 2.

3969
02:44:11,410 --> 02:44:12,130
Not gonna lie.

3970
02:44:12,130 --> 02:44:14,070
Why would you do that?

3971
02:44:14,890 --> 02:44:16,270
No, I told you, Gumi.

3972
02:44:16,350 --> 02:44:17,810
I told you there's a Day 2.

3973
02:44:18,490 --> 02:44:18,850
Yes, I did.

3974
02:44:18,930 --> 02:44:19,390
I remember.

3975
02:44:19,570 --> 02:44:20,750
I told you there was a Day 2.

3976
02:44:20,870 --> 02:44:23,170
And I was like, there's no way we're gonna make it to Day 2, right, Gumi?

3977
02:44:23,290 --> 02:44:24,370
And you were just like, yeah, nah.

3978
02:44:24,530 --> 02:44:26,490
And then I was like, okay, get a team.

3979
02:44:28,090 --> 02:44:30,130
I literally told you there was a Day 2!

3980
02:44:30,170 --> 02:44:30,490
Where?

3981
02:44:31,030 --> 02:44:31,790
In the car!

3982
02:44:32,950 --> 02:44:33,810
I don't remember.

3983
02:44:34,090 --> 02:44:35,710
You cannot pull that on me.

3984
02:44:35,970 --> 02:44:37,930
You cannot pull that on me.

3985
02:44:41,470 --> 02:44:44,670
I literally told you there was a Day 2 in the car.

3986
02:44:44,870 --> 02:44:46,770
When I was like, do you want to do it?

3987
02:44:53,040 --> 02:44:53,400
Huh?

3988
02:44:53,540 --> 02:44:54,060
You say something?

3989
02:44:54,920 --> 02:44:56,000
You fucking whore.

3990
02:44:57,400 --> 02:44:59,660
You just had no faith in us this whole time.

3991
02:44:59,740 --> 02:45:00,460
That's so crazy.

3992
02:45:02,960 --> 02:45:05,100
It's not that I didn't have faith in you guys.

3993
02:45:05,180 --> 02:45:07,400
I just thought we would get eliminated earlier.

3994
02:45:08,120 --> 02:45:09,080
You had faith in the other teams.

3995
02:45:09,340 --> 02:45:09,380
Yeah, I did.

3996
02:45:09,380 --> 02:45:12,200
I honestly had faith that they would be better.

3997
02:45:12,520 --> 02:45:18,200
What if we're just the best?

3998
02:45:18,540 --> 02:45:21,760
You know, if we weren't on EU ping, who knows?

3999
02:45:29,620 --> 02:45:32,760
They used to use a system of...

4000
02:45:33,500 --> 02:45:35,660
How to name a hurricane.

4001
02:45:38,020 --> 02:45:42,400
I honestly thought we were gonna be facing against the teams with the pro players.

4002
02:45:42,500 --> 02:45:45,060
So that's why I was like, well...

4003
02:45:45,060 --> 02:45:47,480
If we're facing the teams with the pro players...

4004
02:45:47,480 --> 02:45:48,840
Maybe that'd be...

4005
02:45:50,300 --> 02:45:51,060
No faith.

4006
02:45:51,180 --> 02:45:54,360
That team would have been free if it was a West Coast server.

4007
02:45:54,540 --> 02:45:55,040
That's all I'm saying.

4008
02:45:55,180 --> 02:45:55,760
That's true.

4009
02:45:56,000 --> 02:45:58,200
But then we would absolutely be on Day 2.

4010
02:46:01,140 --> 02:46:04,300
Yeah, really?

4011
02:46:04,640 --> 02:46:06,520
My chat's saying it's our fault for not...

4012
02:46:06,520 --> 02:46:08,340
We let you down by playing so well.

4013
02:46:09,240 --> 02:46:10,040
That's true.

4014
02:46:10,540 --> 02:46:11,660
It's on us, really.

4015
02:46:11,660 --> 02:46:13,160
I'm literally on your team.

4016
02:46:13,240 --> 02:46:16,320
How could you guys not stand back harder?

4017
02:46:30,020 --> 02:46:30,620
Alright.

4018
02:46:30,820 --> 02:46:33,000
I gotta head off to my next stream now.

4019
02:46:33,540 --> 02:46:34,240
I'll see you guys.

4020
02:46:34,980 --> 02:46:35,580
GG's.

4021
02:46:37,440 --> 02:46:38,640
GG's, everyone.

4022
02:46:39,300 --> 02:46:40,700
Good job, everybody.

4023
02:46:41,200 --> 02:46:41,860
Bye-bye.

4024
02:46:42,500 --> 02:46:46,060
See you guys later tonight for scrims.

4025
02:46:46,640 --> 02:46:47,700
Bye-bye, everybody.

4026
02:46:48,400 --> 02:46:48,960
Bye-bye.

4027
02:46:51,480 --> 02:46:51,960
Okay.

4028
02:46:52,040 --> 02:46:53,440
I'm sorry I couldn't do Day 2.

4029
02:46:53,660 --> 02:46:56,220
Honestly, I was trying to negotiate.

4030
02:46:56,560 --> 02:46:58,560
Trying to see if we could get a middle point.

4031
02:46:59,180 --> 02:46:59,940
But, yeah.

4032
02:47:00,780 --> 02:47:02,760
The majority of the team can't do it.

4033
02:47:03,820 --> 02:47:04,300
Like...

4034
02:47:05,780 --> 02:47:07,480
The majority of the team can't do it.

4035
02:47:07,580 --> 02:47:09,040
There's nothing I can do.

4036
02:47:09,500 --> 02:47:10,720
I don't want to...

4037
02:47:12,120 --> 02:47:12,600
Yeah.

4038
02:47:13,160 --> 02:47:14,380
But it was fun.

4039
02:47:14,440 --> 02:47:15,800
It was really fun playing everybody.

4040
02:47:16,060 --> 02:47:17,460
Oh, my OBS crashed.

4041
02:47:17,460 --> 02:47:17,980
Whoops.

4042
02:47:19,240 --> 02:47:20,840
OBS crashed.

4043
02:47:21,140 --> 02:47:21,500
Oops.

4044
02:47:25,160 --> 02:47:26,000
Alright.

4045
02:47:26,760 --> 02:47:28,500
Sorry, my OBS crashed.

4046
02:47:29,580 --> 02:47:30,420
But...

4047
02:47:30,420 --> 02:47:32,120
Anyway, we're back.

4048
02:47:32,720 --> 02:47:35,020
I do feel really bad because it is a charity.

4049
02:47:36,320 --> 02:47:43,840
I even moved around my schedule to play until the very end.

4050
02:47:47,460 --> 02:47:48,480
And now we're late to the other collab.

4051
02:47:48,620 --> 02:47:50,560
Oh my gosh, my schedule is so all over the place.

4052
02:47:52,860 --> 02:47:55,060
But I had fun playing with the group.

4053
02:47:55,180 --> 02:47:56,940
I had fun playing with the group.

4054
02:47:57,040 --> 02:47:58,120
I was very surprised.

4055
02:47:58,680 --> 02:47:59,440
Like I said.

4056
02:48:06,520 --> 02:48:08,100
I really lost my train of thought.

4057
02:48:12,140 --> 02:48:13,820
I really lost my train of thought.

4058
02:48:13,820 --> 02:48:15,520
But I tried.

4059
02:48:15,800 --> 02:48:19,680
I tried to see if I could get a middle point.

4060
02:48:20,040 --> 02:48:25,660
But since it's an EU tournament our team is full NA.

4061
02:48:25,920 --> 02:48:28,200
So there's nothing we can do.

4062
02:48:28,560 --> 02:48:33,340
Our team is like full NA.

4063
02:48:36,640 --> 02:48:40,180
I can try and find...

4064
02:48:41,660 --> 02:48:42,960
Okay, I don't know.

4065
02:48:43,080 --> 02:48:46,600
At this point, I don't want to force people to play if they don't want to play as well.

4066
02:48:47,640 --> 02:48:50,020
I don't want to force people to play if they can't play too.

4067
02:48:53,760 --> 02:48:55,120
It is what it is.

4068
02:48:56,540 --> 02:48:58,880
Anyway, I'm going to raid the next collab.

4069
02:48:59,140 --> 02:49:00,580
And then we're going to start the stream there.

4070
02:49:02,580 --> 02:49:03,560
It was fun.

4071
02:49:06,740 --> 02:49:11,360
No, I do not think they want to play against in the semi-finals.

4072
02:49:11,540 --> 02:49:12,500
No, I don't.

4073
02:49:12,620 --> 02:49:15,180
I heard about what happened in Group A.

4074
02:49:17,800 --> 02:49:21,140
I heard about what happened in Group A.

4075
02:49:21,240 --> 02:49:27,300
I do not think they want to play against those teams.

4076
02:49:32,400 --> 02:49:34,400
I don't think they want to go again.

4077
02:49:34,400 --> 02:49:35,380
I don't know.

4078
02:49:35,600 --> 02:49:38,160
I don't think they want to go again.

4079
02:49:38,280 --> 02:49:42,140
Anyway, guys, I'm going to raid into what happened.

4080
02:49:42,360 --> 02:49:44,720
Group A was the group with all the pros.

4081
02:49:45,160 --> 02:49:48,480
There were two teams that were full-on pro players.

4082
02:49:49,680 --> 02:50:02,040
Our team had fighting game pros, but the other one was actual FPS pros and MOBA pros and CS pros.

4083
02:50:02,860 --> 02:50:04,500
That's where Holostars were placed.

4084
02:50:05,940 --> 02:50:09,240
I don't think they want to go again.

4085
02:50:09,360 --> 02:50:11,540
I don't think they want to go again.

4086
02:50:15,800 --> 02:50:18,340
That surprised Group B was the easier group.

4087
02:50:18,880 --> 02:50:24,040
Anyway, guys, I'm going to go raid to the other stream and then join them.

4088
02:50:24,600 --> 02:50:25,700
I'll see you guys there.

4089
02:50:26,000 --> 02:50:26,880
Thanks for coming.

4090
02:50:27,080 --> 02:50:28,300
I had a really fun playing with this team.

4091
02:50:28,440 --> 02:50:29,520
Sorry that we couldn't make it to date.

4092
02:50:29,520 --> 02:50:31,640
Sorry we couldn't play day 2.

4093
02:50:32,280 --> 02:50:40,540
If my team was okay with it, I would have played day 2, but if majority of my team can't do it, then my hands are tied at that point.

4094
02:50:41,480 --> 02:50:42,580
Anyway, I'm going to raid.

4095
02:50:42,720 --> 02:50:43,460
I'll see you guys there.

4096
02:50:44,360 --> 02:50:44,800
Bye!
