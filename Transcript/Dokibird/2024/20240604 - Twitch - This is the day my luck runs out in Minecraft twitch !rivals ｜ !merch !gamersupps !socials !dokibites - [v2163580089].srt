1
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,920
Uh, hello.

2
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:57,000
Welcome to day three.

3
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,000
Welcome.

4
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:07,120
Welcome to day three.

5
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:17,420
I never expected to live this far.

6
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:19,380
But here we are.

7
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:25,080
Day three of Minecraft Twitch Rivals!

8
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,620
Let's fucking go!

9
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,480
Good morning, everyone.

10
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,760
Good morning.

11
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,880
Give it up for day three!

12
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,740
Day fucking three!

13
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:41,800
Oh shit, sorry.

14
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:42,740
Oh my gosh.

15
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,160
I already misbroke the rule.

16
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:50,420
Okay, so for those who don't know, today, they're enforcing rules more heavily.

17
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:59,100
So, other than the fact that we're not... they're like, guys, they had like a...

18
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:04,720
today, this morning, they had like, they're enforcing... they're like, we're gonna be enforcing rules now, more...

19
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,800
more strictly.

20
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:08,780
And then, so like, other stuff, it's like, understandable.

21
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,540
No metagaming, like, no stream sniping.

22
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:12,620
You know, stuff like that.

23
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:13,860
That we don't do.

24
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:16,960
And then, they're like, no...

25
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,480
no mic spamming.

26
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,040
Like, no...

27
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:20,480
playing copyright music.

28
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:24,880
Because remember yesterday, people were obnoxiously playing copyright music yesterday.

29
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,460
So they were like, no copyright music.

30
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:34,020
Uh, we're not allowed to like, talk to people outside of the in-game voice chat.

31
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:34,980
Stuff like that.

32
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:44,260
Um, so, cause like, people were talking, you know, people were interacting with like, with... apparently some people were interacting on like, Discord and stuff.

33
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,800
Like, with Discord audio.

34
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,560
So like, no voice proximity.

35
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:50,120
Which I was like, oh my god, that's so smart.

36
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,800
But also, oh my god!

37
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,960
Wait, that's cheating!

38
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:57,880
So...

39
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:00,740
So they were enforcing that.

40
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:04,620
But the one rule that stood out to me the most...

41
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,220
No profanity.

42
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,020
So...

43
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,780
So no more profanity for this bird.

44
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:24,760
So that was like, one of the the five rules.

45
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:27,200
I don't know, five or six rules that they're trying to enforce.

46
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:28,520
Now...

47
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,820
There was another one that interested me.

48
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:34,960
Not as like, isn't like, oh, I'm gonna do it.

49
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:38,120
But like, one of them was like, uh, no!

50
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,480
Oh my gosh.

51
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:40,740
Okay, let me read it again.

52
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:42,440
I thought that rule was so interesting.

53
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:47,040
Cause I'm like, wait, we're actually not allowed to do that?

54
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,140
Let me find it again.

55
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:52,320
It was actually, I was like, what the heck?

56
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:54,360
See, I'm learning.

57
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,660
But one of them...

58
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:00,440
Oh my gosh, where is it?

59
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,020
Where's the general announcement?

60
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:02,900
Oh yeah!

61
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:11,700
Uh, unfair competition, negative behavior, and dishonest acts are strictly forbidden!

62
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:15,220
So that means, no gaslighting!

63
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:26,420
Players are expected to maintain a positive attitude towards fellow competitors!

64
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:33,620
And organizers to ensure a friendly environment!

65
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:42,760
Okay, it doesn't say no gaslighting, but it says unfair competition and negative behavior and dishonest acts are strictly forbidden.

66
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:47,080
I assume that means you can't gaslight others!

67
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:49,120
I assume!

68
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:51,280
I don't know if that's true or not.

69
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:55,140
But like, uh, but like, I assume that's what it means.

70
00:05:55,400 --> 00:06:01,920
Because like, what does like, what does like, uh, what does like, dishonest acts mean?

71
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:04,820
Or like, or like, negative, like, what does that mean?

72
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:08,200
This is like that one guy that was like, this is the wrong house!

73
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:09,540
Does that count?

74
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:19,120
Like, is, remember when like, Agumi and I were running towards the house, and then one of them was like, this, like, is fake comms considered dishonest?

75
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:22,240
Like, does that count?

76
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,180
I don't know!

77
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:27,160
But like, that rule is actually pretty frickin' vague.

78
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:35,500
Okay, I had to uh, that rule was pretty frickin' vague.

79
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:41,340
So like, I couldn't really tell, uh, what that actually meant.

80
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:55,260
Um, also, uh, apparently you're allowed, uh, you're allowed to rat out other prop players if you're a prop.

81
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:59,460
And like, that's messed up.

82
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:11,700
Like, cause like, that's so, like, why, like, who would wanna be a prop at that point?

83
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:15,480
Like, just eliminate a fellow prop player!

84
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:16,380
Yeah!

85
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:20,400
You're allowed to, like, shout, like, rat other prop members out!

86
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:26,140
Okay, so the fourth game, the fourth, okay, wait, one, two, okay, sorry, the fifth game.

87
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:31,080
The fifth game is called, like, uh, Duck Duck Curse or some shit.

88
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:32,640
I mean, some frick.

89
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:34,540
I'm trying.

90
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:35,580
Okay.

91
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:37,800
I'm trying really hard.

92
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:42,300
I'm not a Minecraft player, so that's built in.

93
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:44,480
Man, I'm an FPS gamer.

94
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:54,060
We've said, like, I've heard and said, like, so much profanity, and I've heard so much worse.

95
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:58,180
Anyway.

96
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:13,120
Anyway, so basically, it's like, uh, RNG, so we have to run around and find, like, cursed dolls, and then we have to, like, uh, but the thing is, the cursed doll can either be safe or a curse.

97
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:15,220
So it's, like, RNG.

98
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:21,080
Um, so you don't know if you're gonna get the curse or the safe doll.

99
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:27,940
And then when you find the cursed doll, you have to run away, because, like, I assume they look like this, I assume, because these look like cursed dolls.

100
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:31,500
So, like, you have to, like, run away, and if you get caught, you get eliminated.

101
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,560
Oh my gosh, if I get eliminated on the first game, oh my gosh.

102
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:35,740
Freedom.

103
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:45,660
I mean, it would be fun if day four...

104
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:53,940
Anyway, freedom is so close.

105
00:08:54,640 --> 00:09:06,520
Anyway, day, uh, okay, game game five game five is ten people will be eliminated, but game six, thirty people will be eliminated.

106
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:25,120
Right now, players are arguing with the organizers on whether or not you should be allowed to rat out other prop prop players, because one of them was, like, one of, one of, I saw people using the rules against the admins, and was, like, ratting other prop members is negative behavior.

107
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:30,460
So vague!

108
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:32,600
Like, that's what I'm saying!

109
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:35,780
Those rules are so goddamn vague!

110
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:46,240
Like, so, like, I see like, people in the server, the discord chat, was like, that is negative behavior because it's griefing other players!

111
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,440
So, so, um...

112
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:53,500
So, it's, like, dishonest!

113
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,940
It ruins competitive integrity!

114
00:09:56,500 --> 00:10:02,160
So, like, the admins and, like, the players are, like, arguing right now about it, and that's why we're not starting it.

115
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:05,660
I think, I think, there's 94 players?

116
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,780
Oh, that means, like, all of them are just admins.

117
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:09,900
Like, how is there 94 players?

118
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:11,900
There should be only 80 players.

119
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,420
How is there, like, so many admins?

120
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,660
Not the competitive integrity.

121
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:28,780
That's why we're not starting it, because people are, like, arguing right now about the rules for the second game.

122
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,080
I mean, that's what I'm saying!

123
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,140
It's so vague!

124
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:38,200
Like, what counts as what counts as competitive and, like, what counts as negative?

125
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:38,980
Negative behavior!

126
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:42,000
It's so goddamn vague!

127
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:52,200
Oh, they're making changes to the launcher?

128
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:53,540
Alright.

129
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:54,500
Okay.

130
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,940
Alright, I don't know.

131
00:10:56,380 --> 00:11:04,320
Yeah, and apparently, okay, one other funny thing is that people were complaining about the copyright music that was being played yesterday.

132
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:08,700
Like, whoever that little hecker was that...

133
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:11,740
that...

134
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:12,420
that...

135
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:20,180
Because, like, apparently people, like, uploaded their bots and got copyright striked.

136
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:20,900
Yeah!

137
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:35,500
Like, whoever that was, I don't know if they're still in this lobby, but people were complaining because they're, like, we got a copyright strike because someone got, like, um...

138
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,640
Someone, you know, people were playing copyright music.

139
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:42,880
So people were like, bro, my bot got a strike!

140
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,400
Like, bro, I got a claim!

141
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,420
I can't monetize it!

142
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:49,520
So yeah, I thought that was...

143
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,920
Well, to me, it was funny.

144
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,400
But, like, obviously, that sucks, man.

145
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:01,580
Like, that sucks, bro.

146
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:04,860
But, like, to me, that was pretty funny.

147
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:11,460
Alright.

148
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:12,460
Alright, I guess...

149
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:14,420
I guess we should...

150
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:16,960
I guess we cannot take meds for a little bit.

151
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:18,320
Alright.

152
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:20,760
Where is everybody?

153
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,160
There should be, like, 90 players.

154
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,200
Where is Gumi?

155
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:28,540
I need her to clutch it for me.

156
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:32,300
I need her to...

157
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:37,100
I need her to, like, move on to day 4 for me and suffer.

158
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:40,120
I was just, like, a colleague before.

159
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,500
Alright, where is me?

160
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:44,020
A, B, C...

161
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:45,020
Wait, where is D?

162
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,100
Oh, my God.

163
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,680
All the Ds are almost dead.

164
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:49,480
Except for me!

165
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:52,180
Yay!

166
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:56,960
It's not metagaming because it's happening in-game.

167
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,720
Which is not allowed to metagame outside, like, outside of the game.

168
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:04,920
Uh...

169
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:05,400
Whoa!

170
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,000
Guys!

171
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:10,980
Guys!

172
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,340
Oh, my God, do you see that?

173
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:16,940
Guys, it's already getting spicy in the server.

174
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,280
People are already playing music in the lobby.

175
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,760
Can we please stop that?

176
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:28,260
Oh, no!

177
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,620
It's already getting spicy!

178
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:39,080
Oh, my God!

179
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:42,380
They have to write it in Spanish too because they don't know!

180
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,980
They don't know!

181
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:46,700
It was just a language barrier.

182
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:56,080
To be fair, the complaints of it was mostly in English, so I don't know if the Spanish players knew that that was not allowed.

183
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:58,820
Oh, my God.

184
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:00,460
You got called out in two languages.

185
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:03,200
Oh, my God, in front of everybody!

186
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,320
Oh, my God!

187
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,400
In front of everyone!

188
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,300
Holy shit!

189
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:11,900
Oh, shoot!

190
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:13,880
Holy shoot!

191
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,000
Oh, my God!

192
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,460
Oh, my God!

193
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:21,500
Gumi's in the kitchen.

194
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:24,780
Gumi's gonna carry me, right?

195
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:26,460
Gumi's gonna carry me, right?

196
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:26,760
She's gonna...

197
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,300
She's gonna carry me, right?

198
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:32,660
Liars!

199
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:34,140
There's no Gumi in here.

200
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,040
There is a TV.

201
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,100
She's in the dining hall?

202
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,080
That's not a kitchen!

203
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:47,980
Guys, you guys need to know the difference between a kitchen and a dining hall.

204
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:55,680
What?

205
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,240
Actually?

206
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:56,860
Oh, my gosh!

207
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,480
What is the admin calling out about now?

208
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,040
Oh!

209
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:02,700
Oh!

210
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:10,230
Oh, my God!

211
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:11,950
The callouts are real!

212
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:14,690
The callouts are real!

213
00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:17,530
I told you guys.

214
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:20,970
They're enforcing the rules like legit now.

215
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:22,130
Gumi!

216
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:23,250
Gumi!

217
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:26,230
We're live!

218
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:27,790
Get in the backpack!

219
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:28,350
Get in!

220
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:29,110
Yay!

221
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:29,370
Yay!

222
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:32,790
I told you guys, but your skin...

223
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:33,610
You put it on wrong.

224
00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:34,410
I know.

225
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:35,690
I can't be bothered.

226
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:36,850
I know since day one.

227
00:15:37,090 --> 00:15:38,790
I can't be bothered!

228
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:40,550
Tucker, Pickle...

229
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:42,330
I don't know if I...

230
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:45,230
As long as the front works, that's all that matters.

231
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:45,990
Hello, Shane.

232
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:48,470
Yeah, okie-dokie.

233
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:52,590
That was a funny joke.

234
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:54,110
Okie-dokie.

235
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:55,590
What the?

236
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:56,010
Duh.

237
00:15:56,370 --> 00:15:57,190
Hi, guys.

238
00:15:58,330 --> 00:16:01,990
Gumi, did you see the hard enforcement of rules today?

239
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:02,910
I did!

240
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:04,470
Did you see that?

241
00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:07,090
No swearing!

242
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:08,530
Hello?

243
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:10,390
You found one, Sam?

244
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:12,570
What's up, Gumiho?

245
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:16,550
Today will probably be the most RNG day, I think.

246
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:17,710
Gummy!

247
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:19,570
Well, ouch.

248
00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:21,470
Well, also, I wonder...

249
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:23,110
I wonder if it's going to be like...

250
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:25,170
So tired already.

251
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:29,870
You guys find any over here, Oli?

252
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:32,710
The thing is, I don't know if like...

253
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:34,290
If you get eliminated...

254
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:36,030
As a hider...

255
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:38,390
Like, as a prop hider...

256
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:41,190
Like, how do the hunters get eliminated then?

257
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:42,690
Like, I don't understand.

258
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:45,070
Why would the prop players want to call each other?

259
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:47,170
Why would the prop players...

260
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:50,170
Call out other prop players?

261
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:51,910
Because how would the hunters die?

262
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:54,890
Like, I feel like that's just...

263
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:55,570
That's just...

264
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:56,170
That's just dumb!

265
00:16:57,930 --> 00:16:59,310
Gummy, do you understand the...

266
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:00,550
Prop hunt thing?

267
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:01,390
On how it's getting...

268
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:03,270
I thought prop hunt would be like a team game.

269
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:05,990
But do you see people arguing about whether or not you can call...

270
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:08,550
Like, throw other prop players under the bus?

271
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:10,170
To get eliminated?

272
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:11,470
I did see that.

273
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:12,690
Yeah, so I'm confused.

274
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:15,730
I thought the prop hunt was a team-based game.

275
00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:18,050
No, I think it's a one-for-all.

276
00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:20,610
But then how would the hunters get eliminated?

277
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:22,070
I guess like...

278
00:17:22,070 --> 00:17:23,010
If they don't hunt enough?

279
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:24,970
If they don't get at least one person or something?

280
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:28,190
Yeah, but then like, prop players can get eliminated by like...

281
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:29,350
You know, getting caught.

282
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:31,130
So like, how would...

283
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:33,750
That's so... That's so confusing.

284
00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:35,590
So like, it's better...

285
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:37,370
It's just better to be a hunter...

286
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:38,450
Than a prop player.

287
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:41,210
Yeah...

288
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:42,410
And Frost!

289
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:43,470
I have 28!

290
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:45,130
Oh, for an important...

291
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:46,050
Oh, important announcement.

292
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:49,890
Server restarting?

293
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:51,330
Oh, they're restarting the server.

294
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:53,630
I thought...

295
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:55,730
Aww, I wish it was a team game.

296
00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:58,030
Any music of any kind is not allowed in voice chat.

297
00:17:58,530 --> 00:17:59,050
Nooooo!

298
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:02,230
Nooooo!

299
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:03,330
Why are you guys...

300
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:04,950
Complaining about...

301
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:06,330
Minecraft, please.

302
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:12,450
I'm just like...

303
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:14,650
I'm just like...

304
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:14,670
I'm just like...

305
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:15,830
Why does it matter?

306
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:17,630
Why?

307
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:22,050
I'm so...

308
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:22,490
I'm so confused!

309
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:26,010
Why would it matter if you can't play...

310
00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:26,590
If you...

311
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:29,930
If you want to play music...

312
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:31,370
In voice chat...

313
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:33,950
Just play music in your own stream.

314
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:35,070
You have to realize that.

315
00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:38,690
That doesn't make sense to me.

316
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:39,590
I'm sorry.

317
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:41,270
I'm not... I don't understand.

318
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:43,510
Guys, I actually...

319
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:44,710
I don't understand.

320
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:44,870
I don't understand.

321
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:45,890
Okay.

322
00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:48,210
Alright.

323
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:53,150
Voice chat will be completely disabled by the server in...

324
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:54,210
Oh, in prop hunt.

325
00:18:54,530 --> 00:18:55,090
Oh!

326
00:18:58,590 --> 00:18:59,150
Hello?

327
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:00,210
Hey!

328
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:03,990
So...

329
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:05,810
Yeah?

330
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:08,330
I found out...

331
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:10,230
Okay, so they're turning up voice chat...

332
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:12,270
For the prop hunt thing, so we don't grief each other.

333
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:12,750
Yeah.

334
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:17,070
I'm pretty sure...

335
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:17,410
It's like...

336
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:19,570
Hunters have to at least get one.

337
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:21,830
I'm pretty sure it's going to be a really big house.

338
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:23,390
So like...

339
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:25,750
It makes it even...

340
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:28,510
That hunters only have to get one and props have to survive.

341
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:30,410
I...

342
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:31,890
I'm just making...

343
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:32,630
That's why I'm like...

344
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:34,730
The transform run is just so confusing.

345
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:36,290
I'm just...

346
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:38,850
But I also don't like that we have to do tasks.

347
00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:41,250
Yeah, you have to do tasks as a prop.

348
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:43,890
So it feels like it's better to be a hunter than a prop.

349
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:45,490
Because it's easier to grab...

350
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:46,870
Like hunt props.

351
00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:48,750
Than it is to like...

352
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:50,170
Be a prop.

353
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:51,490
And then you have to like...

354
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:54,590
Make sure you don't get caught while doing tasks.

355
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:57,550
Because I feel like props will get eliminated so fast.

356
00:19:57,610 --> 00:19:58,390
Because of it.

357
00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:00,270
Yeah, I agree.

358
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:01,430
Yeah.

359
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:03,230
That's why I was like so confused.

360
00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:05,590
It would have been better if it was just a team game.

361
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:07,450
And then like all the props...

362
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:09,450
Or like if the hunters win and get everybody.

363
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:10,950
All the props...

364
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:12,930
Would win on one side.

365
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:15,350
Because then it's more RNG.

366
00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:17,690
And like people can actually work together.

367
00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:19,210
Yeah.

368
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:20,990
It's kind of like...

369
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:22,650
You're trying to think of like prop hunt rules.

370
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:23,390
Yeah.

371
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:25,750
Yeah.

372
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:28,350
Because I feel like it's hard to limit...

373
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:31,230
Because it's just better to be RNG'd as a hunter.

374
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:33,690
Than it is to be RNG'd as a prop.

375
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:35,730
Because like...

376
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:37,130
What if you just don't do anything?

377
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:39,290
What if you just do one task?

378
00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:40,470
And then like...

379
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:42,670
Or like what if all the prop players...

380
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:44,830
Successfully do all the tasks?

381
00:20:45,290 --> 00:20:46,550
And not like...

382
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:49,550
It's just confusing.

383
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:54,650
Are you in the lobby now?

384
00:20:56,290 --> 00:20:57,330
I'm launching.

385
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:58,190
Yeah, yeah.

386
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:00,030
Because you see the new...

387
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:02,530
They're like nobody is allowed to use third priority.

388
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:04,510
I was like...

389
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:06,390
People were using Discord?

390
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:09,650
Dude, I thought that shit wasn't allowed.

391
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:10,810
Like from day one.

392
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:11,470
Yeah.

393
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:12,970
And then I'm like...

394
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:15,110
Did they get disqualified?

395
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:16,950
Or are they still in the game?

396
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:17,710
I'm like...

397
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:18,470
That's pretty unfair.

398
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:21,290
They're using Discord groups.

399
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:26,390
I have to deal with 100 people...

400
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:27,630
Mic spamming my lobby.

401
00:21:27,770 --> 00:21:29,830
And they get to be in a Discord group?

402
00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:31,790
Yeah, what's it called?

403
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:33,370
I found out that in-game...

404
00:21:33,370 --> 00:21:35,230
I forgot that in-game voice...

405
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:36,810
Yeah, it has a group chat.

406
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:38,690
They disabled it.

407
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:40,950
Yeah, I asked a question about it and they're like...

408
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:41,130
No!

409
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:42,130
Not allowed.

410
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:45,170
Yeah, so for chat, for those who don't know...

411
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:46,270
This is actually not allowed.

412
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:47,590
The group voice chat.

413
00:21:47,870 --> 00:21:49,730
Even though it's in the game.

414
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:50,910
It's not allowed.

415
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:55,830
They want everybody to have...

416
00:21:55,830 --> 00:21:57,210
To use voice proximity.

417
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:00,650
Alright, I'm launching now.

418
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:02,330
Alright, I'll see you in game.

419
00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:04,210
Bye-bye.

420
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:05,390
Bye-bye.

421
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:08,870
Guys, I'm pretty sure...

422
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:11,550
Guys...

423
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:15,470
If we make it to the second game...

424
00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:17,530
If I get propped...

425
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:18,050
It's over.

426
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:25,270
If I get propped...

427
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:26,070
It's so over.

428
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:29,090
What we discovered.

429
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:35,510
Guys, they actually have to...

430
00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:37,150
Disable the voice chat.

431
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:39,510
So it's emotes mode only.

432
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:41,490
In the transform...

433
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:42,470
In the prop hut.

434
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:45,590
No, we have to do tasks.

435
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:47,310
Dude, if we're propped...

436
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:48,770
We have to do tasks.

437
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:51,070
So we can't stay at propped forever.

438
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:53,570
We have to move around...

439
00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:54,950
And do stuff.

440
00:22:55,410 --> 00:22:56,510
And that's what I'm saying!

441
00:22:56,930 --> 00:22:59,570
If we get propped...

442
00:22:59,570 --> 00:23:01,530
The RNG is so bad.

443
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:02,770
Because the hunter...

444
00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:04,070
We have to camp the...

445
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:06,550
I guess if they don't know the task...

446
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:07,410
They can't camp it.

447
00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:10,090
But it feels like it's easier...

448
00:23:10,090 --> 00:23:11,530
To be a hunter.

449
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:14,270
Yeah.

450
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:16,150
The hunter advantage.

451
00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:21,050
It's so...

452
00:23:21,050 --> 00:23:21,990
Oh my god.

453
00:23:22,010 --> 00:23:23,250
It's so big.

454
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:26,750
30 people will be eliminated.

455
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:29,150
Transport in the prop hut 2.

456
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:30,950
Because I'm like thinking...

457
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:33,350
I honestly thought it was supposed to be...

458
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:33,990
A team game.

459
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:35,250
That's like legit.

460
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:36,270
That's what I thought.

461
00:23:36,530 --> 00:23:37,730
I was like oh my gosh.

462
00:23:37,770 --> 00:23:38,530
It's like a team game.

463
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:42,490
Because like whoever...

464
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:44,350
Whichever side wins...

465
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:45,630
They can move on.

466
00:23:45,810 --> 00:23:46,330
But no.

467
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:48,330
It's not a team game.

468
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:52,790
It's not a team game.

469
00:23:52,930 --> 00:23:54,450
It's a one for all.

470
00:24:00,530 --> 00:24:03,390
It's a one for all.

471
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:04,150
It's a one for all.

472
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:05,550
Every...

473
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:08,750
Every hunter and prop for themselves.

474
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:09,510
Chat.

475
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:12,430
Alright.

476
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:13,530
Let's see.

477
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:16,510
They're completely disabling voice chat.

478
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:18,190
So other props...

479
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:20,530
Other props can't throw...

480
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:22,710
Other props can't throw...

481
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:23,970
Throw each other out.

482
00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:25,350
To get eliminated fast.

483
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:26,690
That just makes me wonder.

484
00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:29,710
I guess like props...

485
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:31,970
That have the least completed task...

486
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:32,790
Get eliminated.

487
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:35,010
But then like...

488
00:24:35,010 --> 00:24:36,090
What if there's like...

489
00:24:36,090 --> 00:24:39,950
We should gatekeep Ambrose.

490
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:40,290
Okay.

491
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:45,330
How many eggs do you guys have?

492
00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:46,890
I'm just like thinking like...

493
00:24:48,770 --> 00:24:50,370
I'm just thinking like...

494
00:24:50,370 --> 00:24:51,710
What if we have...

495
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:53,350
Like what if we...

496
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:54,350
Have more...

497
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:55,810
More members...

498
00:24:55,810 --> 00:24:58,310
Like I guess we'll have to do tiebreakers.

499
00:24:58,670 --> 00:24:59,810
Because what if like...

500
00:24:59,810 --> 00:25:01,990
There's hunters that got like zero kills.

501
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:04,670
And there's props that done zero tasks.

502
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:06,590
But like...

503
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:08,890
Zero tasks.

504
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:11,270
But there's like more...

505
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:13,010
How do you eliminate all of them?

506
00:25:13,010 --> 00:25:14,870
All the guardians look the same in my eyes.

507
00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:16,450
Yeah I brought us to the wrong side.

508
00:25:16,930 --> 00:25:18,330
Where are we going?

509
00:25:18,870 --> 00:25:20,750
Is there a third one?

510
00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:23,090
This is just like...

511
00:25:23,090 --> 00:25:23,830
Where are we going?

512
00:25:24,210 --> 00:25:26,090
Gumi doesn't have any of the eggs.

513
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:28,210
Gumi has zero bro.

514
00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:29,290
Why am I bald?

515
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:32,570
Average day.

516
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:36,070
Registered in the state of YouTube.

517
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:38,490
Oh!

518
00:25:38,810 --> 00:25:39,870
Wait I don't care.

519
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:41,710
About easter eggs.

520
00:25:43,170 --> 00:25:44,550
Oh my gosh.

521
00:25:46,930 --> 00:25:49,550
I actually don't care about the easter eggs.

522
00:25:49,810 --> 00:25:50,790
So Gumi is a third one?

523
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:53,430
Like besides the parkour one and the other one?

524
00:25:53,530 --> 00:25:55,290
Like a hidden one?

525
00:25:55,630 --> 00:25:56,510
What are we doing?

526
00:25:56,850 --> 00:25:58,870
Are we still finding easter eggs?

527
00:26:01,290 --> 00:26:03,350
Cause like there's no...

528
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:04,410
There's no...

529
00:26:04,410 --> 00:26:05,490
That's a lie.

530
00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:06,930
What?

531
00:26:09,550 --> 00:26:12,190
I remember you lied before.

532
00:26:12,770 --> 00:26:13,330
I'm gonna stand on it.

533
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:15,450
I'm gonna stand on it.

534
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:16,950
Yeah who needs eggs?

535
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:20,030
Wait is there another...

536
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:20,610
There's another ad.

537
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:21,890
An announcement?

538
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:25,030
Oh my god look at the crowd.

539
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:26,510
For the easter eggs.

540
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:29,310
It's like when you dangle keys in front of a baby.

541
00:26:29,930 --> 00:26:31,370
But you dangle...

542
00:26:31,370 --> 00:26:32,530
Oh my god there is one here!

543
00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:33,070
How many do you have?

544
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:33,750
28.

545
00:26:36,390 --> 00:26:37,270
Oh okay.

546
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:41,670
It's like dangling keys in front of a child.

547
00:26:41,890 --> 00:26:43,130
Or dangling easter eggs.

548
00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:44,690
In front of like the Minecraft players.

549
00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:45,850
So like...

550
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:47,990
To like pad the time.

551
00:26:53,330 --> 00:26:54,450
Oh my god.

552
00:26:54,490 --> 00:26:54,710
Oh my god.

553
00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:55,350
Where's your hat?

554
00:26:56,230 --> 00:26:57,310
That's what I'm saying.

555
00:26:57,450 --> 00:26:58,250
Where'd my hair go?

556
00:26:59,050 --> 00:26:59,910
Oh my god.

557
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:02,730
It looks like you shaved the top of your head.

558
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:04,810
Hold my hand.

559
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:06,610
What happened to your skin?

560
00:27:07,330 --> 00:27:08,230
I don't know.

561
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:09,130
What did you do?

562
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:11,550
I don't feel so good.

563
00:27:14,290 --> 00:27:16,990
Does it look right?

564
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:17,970
It doesn't look right.

565
00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:18,870
It doesn't look right at all.

566
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:22,610
Where did she go?

567
00:27:22,790 --> 00:27:23,870
Oh my god she died!

568
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:25,550
Oh my god!

569
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:26,590
She disappeared!

570
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:29,970
One less player.

571
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:32,230
One less player to worry about.

572
00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:37,990
I'm joking guys!

573
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:39,610
I'm joking!

574
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:40,670
Chad!

575
00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:44,910
She carried me all the way to game day 3.

576
00:27:46,130 --> 00:27:47,830
There goes your kegs.

577
00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:48,410
Exactly!

578
00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:48,690
Guys!

579
00:27:48,970 --> 00:27:49,850
I'm joking.

580
00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:51,790
I need her to carry me.

581
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:53,150
Wait.

582
00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:53,570
No.

583
00:27:54,410 --> 00:27:54,890
No.

584
00:27:55,030 --> 00:27:55,790
She's gone.

585
00:27:57,230 --> 00:27:59,210
There's a high chance I'll get eliminated.

586
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:01,790
On the first game.

587
00:28:02,570 --> 00:28:05,190
And if I get eliminated on the first game...

588
00:28:06,370 --> 00:28:08,170
I don't have to do day 4.

589
00:28:14,410 --> 00:28:16,190
I don't need to do day 4.

590
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:48,130
I don't have to do day 4.

591
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:49,810
One last game.

592
00:28:49,810 --> 00:28:50,110
I don't know.

593
00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:57,070
I can just... I can just not... not stream tomorrow.

594
00:28:58,230 --> 00:29:00,870
No, Doki, you gotta try.

595
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:02,430
Doki.

596
00:29:05,930 --> 00:29:07,730
Doki is losing it.

597
00:29:08,290 --> 00:29:17,550
All I'm saying, guys, with Gumi eliminated, there is a high chance that I too will be eliminated.

598
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:20,170
Snap out of it.

599
00:29:22,290 --> 00:29:28,210
I don't have to stay awake and I'm holding everybody hostage, even my own.

600
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:30,750
I'm holding myself hostage.

601
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:33,550
Oh my god.

602
00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:36,130
Wait, what's the new... there's a new announcement.

603
00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:37,250
What is it?

604
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:38,070
Alright.

605
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:45,410
Alright, what is the new... guys, seriously, stop playing music over a mic!

606
00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:47,530
Are people still doing this?

607
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:54,060
Bro.

608
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,220
Oh my god.

609
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:56,680
Oh my god.

610
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:58,280
People are admin mad.

611
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:01,380
Admin's actually mad.

612
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:08,200
They're like, alright, we're actually gonna remove people now.

613
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,560
You keep playing music.

614
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:10,960
Oh my god, guys.

615
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:16,020
I'm gonna start snitching.

616
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:22,720
Oh my god, it's time.

617
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:23,440
It's time.

618
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:28,440
It's time to start my Doki arc and start snitching.

619
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:32,640
Quick, play music and be free.

620
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:33,360
No, no.

621
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:36,220
If I can, like, catch people.

622
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:42,960
If I can catch people playing music, one less person to worry about.

623
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:46,400
No negativity, remember?

624
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:47,980
It's not negativity.

625
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:50,500
I'm looking at the competitive integrity.

626
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:52,100
Of this game.

627
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:58,980
Oh my god, you're right.

628
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,360
If I play...

629
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,800
That's actually messed up.

630
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,420
That's like a brilliant plan.

631
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:09,140
Like, oh my god, a villain came up with this perfect plan.

632
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:10,900
That's when you know I'm not a villain.

633
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:14,900
Because the fact that... and like, I'm not an actual villain.

634
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,940
Because even I wouldn't have come up with that.

635
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:22,240
But someone in my chat was like, quick, play music over a group of people and call somebody out.

636
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,380
That's so evil.

637
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:29,820
That's actually so god damn evil.

638
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:33,300
Oh my god.

639
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:37,400
You, sir, are a very evil person.

640
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,720
That's so...

641
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:44,160
Guys, the Among Us part of this game ended, chat.

642
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:45,920
Oh my god, we're 30...

643
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,480
We're 33 minutes late.

644
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:51,420
Because the server is messed up at the moment.

645
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:52,860
Oh, okay.

646
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:54,940
Alright, let's see.

647
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:56,680
Okay, wait, what was the info?

648
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:58,820
What was the info?

649
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:00,060
Yeah.

650
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:05,360
Okay, they were saying that the doll, every level, would speed up.

651
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:06,260
Oh.

652
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:09,940
Okay, so the bad doll is gonna get faster and faster.

653
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:10,980
Ooh, okay.

654
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:14,100
Interesting.

655
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:14,440
Interesting.

656
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,000
They have someone working for them.

657
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,420
Yeah, they have someone on the inside.

658
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:19,760
Yeah, they got a guy on the inside.

659
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:20,780
That's crazy.

660
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:21,260
Ooh.

661
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:24,420
Guys, we got insider info.

662
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:26,720
I'm gonna snitch them out for it.

663
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,060
Hey.

664
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:31,060
You heard the secrets too?

665
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:32,140
Yeah.

666
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,760
We're being spied on, James.

667
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,960
The TV up there?

668
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:39,860
No, there is a TV up there, though, if you need to get down.

669
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:41,280
Oh, I got that one.

670
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:44,200
I got three secret guys.

671
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:45,940
I didn't know that.

672
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:51,720
Well, you're gonna do uninstall the info from my brain?

673
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:56,160
Oh, thank God.

674
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,080
Oh, my God.

675
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,320
I'm gonna snitch them.

676
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,240
I'm gonna snitch them out to the admins.

677
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:07,100
One of your admin gave the other...

678
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:07,880
One of your...

679
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:11,220
One of your admins gave the other player insight.

680
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:11,960
Insider info.

681
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:14,460
So, she was metagaming.

682
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:21,240
She was metagaming.

683
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:24,100
Rule number 33.

684
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:29,120
I don't know where anymore are.

685
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:30,900
Oh, my God.

686
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:31,980
Goomy, goomy, goomy.

687
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:36,340
I heard insider info from somebody that's apparently friends with the admin.

688
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:40,820
They were telling one player that, like, the doll...

689
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:43,160
It's gonna get faster and faster each round.

690
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:44,820
The evil doll.

691
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:46,520
Okay.

692
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:47,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

693
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:48,820
Oh, God.

694
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,360
Is this one hide-and-seek?

695
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:56,120
Or is it hide-and-seek tag or something?

696
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,820
It's like hide-and-seek tag.

697
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:01,080
It seems like it's almost like musical chairs.

698
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:02,020
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

699
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:03,640
Musical chairs with hide-and-seek.

700
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:04,780
Yeah.

701
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:09,520
So, like, if you are unlucky and you get a bad doll, you have to start hiding.

702
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:10,560
Yeah.

703
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:14,940
You know, I find it funny, Ant, how we were saying we want to search everywhere but the black corner.

704
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,280
And that's exactly where it was.

705
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:17,040
Yeah.

706
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,640
I feel like my frames are dropping.

707
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:21,000
Does it really matter, though?

708
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:22,660
The frames are...

709
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,740
I was doing 30 before and now I'm at 100.

710
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:26,740
You were running 30.

711
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:26,960
Oh, yeah.

712
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:27,440
I'm at 100, too.

713
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:30,280
Yesterday, I was running 30 in the lobby.

714
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:31,900
There's a lot more people yesterday, too.

715
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:33,400
They did also...

716
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:33,700
I'm back.

717
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:36,940
They did turn down the default run distance, as well.

718
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:37,740
All right.

719
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:37,960
Oh.

720
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:42,040
I turned it back up, though, because I just wasn't rendering, like, the whole, like, lobby.

721
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:42,820
Yeah.

722
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:46,480
I turned down the render distance just because I didn't need that much.

723
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:47,380
It was, like, at 20.

724
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:49,980
I might turn it back down, to be honest.

725
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:50,960
I'm at, like, 8.

726
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:51,560
I'm at, like...

727
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:53,580
People are still complaining about the music.

728
00:34:56,540 --> 00:34:59,460
I don't think it matters if the frames are low.

729
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:00,220
Yeah.

730
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:03,660
But, like, we're not, like, talking during the game.

731
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:05,480
We're just talking while we wait for the event to start.

732
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:05,760
I know.

733
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:06,660
I know.

734
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:07,200
But, like...

735
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:07,440
Yeah.

736
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,720
I'm at around, like, 3,000 renders right now.

737
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:09,860
Yeah.

738
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:09,960
I did the same thing.

739
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:10,460
I was, like...

740
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:11,960
I feel like they're talking about us, but...

741
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:12,700
That might work.

742
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:13,900
We're, like, the only ones on.

743
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:14,640
We're all on call.

744
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:15,260
So, I don't know.

745
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:16,580
So, how's the rest week?

746
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:17,540
All right, guys.

747
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:21,120
Well, I've been in the server with 100-plus people for, like, three days straight.

748
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:21,980
Oh, my God.

749
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:22,440
Guys, look.

750
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:23,000
A knight right there.

751
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:26,140
My social battery is not okay at the moment.

752
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,280
I vanished into a wall.

753
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:35,740
It's not okay.

754
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:36,640
Oh.

755
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:40,780
You silly Billy.

756
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:43,920
Sounds like the opposite of resting.

757
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:44,740
Oh, my God.

758
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:45,380
10 seconds.

759
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:46,980
10 seconds, guys.

760
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:48,680
Oh, my God.

761
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:49,700
I cannot wait.

762
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:52,060
I cannot wait to be the first 10 out.

763
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,520
I can't wait, guys.

764
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:00,440
What the...

765
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:02,480
What the fuck is this?

766
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:03,140
Whoa.

767
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:03,980
Whoa.

768
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:04,580
Whoa.

769
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:04,860
Whoa.

770
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:04,880
Whoa.

771
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:06,200
Whoa.

772
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,600
Stop it!

773
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:11,780
You sound... Doki, please, at least, like, pretend.

774
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:14,240
Guys, help me out.

775
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:15,500
Guys, help me out.

776
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:16,920
Guys, help me out.

777
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:20,400
Guys...

778
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:23,960
Oh, but don't eliminate it, guys.

779
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:29,660
Oh, wait.

780
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:30,480
Hey!

781
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:35,780
Alright, all on red!

782
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:36,460
All on red!

783
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:37,000
All on red!

784
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:37,820
All on red!

785
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:38,580
All on red!

786
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:38,780
Yeah!

787
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,380
All on red!

788
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,000
All on red!

789
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:44,980
Go bring my meds!

790
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:46,440
I need to take my meds soon!

791
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:49,320
Go bring my meds!

792
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:49,340
I need to take my meds soon!

793
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:50,820
Alright, I should take my meds.

794
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:53,840
Oh my god, the voices, they're getting louder!

795
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:55,340
They're getting...

796
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:57,020
The one with the most people, like...

797
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:59,420
I wonder, are they gonna TP us?

798
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:01,280
Based off of what color we're standing on?

799
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:04,260
Maybe let's stand up...

800
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:06,180
Well, maybe later we'll go on red, yeah?

801
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:07,180
Yeah, yeah, sure.

802
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:09,920
Oh, I have an idea.

803
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:11,420
If we both...

804
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:15,880
If we both pick the same doll, the doll will only kill one of us.

805
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:18,840
That sounds like the most...

806
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:21,000
Worst idea you've ever come up with.

807
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:25,120
But, like, that's why it's a 50-50.

808
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:25,580
But, like, that's why it's a 50-50.

809
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:27,100
No, it sounds like you're a dumb...

810
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:28,000
What?

811
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,640
You can't swear profanity!

812
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:30,480
I didn't swear!

813
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:31,060
I didn't swear!

814
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:34,980
What were you saying?

815
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:35,480
I didn't swear!

816
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:38,520
Just dumb!

817
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:39,140
You're just dumb!

818
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:42,260
I feel like there was a second word there!

819
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:43,220
Dumb bear!

820
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:43,460
Dumb bear!

821
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:43,720
Dumb bear!

822
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:44,380
Dumb bear!

823
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:52,380
All I'm saying is that this doll will only pick one of us.

824
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:53,320
Look around!

825
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:54,400
Do you think you're gonna hide?

826
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:57,380
Stop talking to me!

827
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:01,920
I think it's a good plan.

828
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:02,520
I think it's a good plan.

829
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:03,080
I don't understand.

830
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:06,540
You're the same person who doesn't know how to read.

831
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:07,140
You're the same person who doesn't know how to read.

832
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:09,000
Yeah, but that doesn't require reading.

833
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,040
It's just probability.

834
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,280
It's just probability.

835
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:15,920
It's just probability.

836
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:16,000
It's math.

837
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:19,100
We're next to the...

838
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:21,220
Wait, the Spanish players know what they're doing.

839
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:21,520
Oh.

840
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:23,900
Oh.

841
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:29,320
Oh my god!

842
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:30,500
It's like roulette!

843
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:34,940
Any of you remain with a chance to escape the house of nightmares.

844
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:38,200
But it won't be easy.

845
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,780
And for this next challenge...

846
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:41,580
Wait, what?

847
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:42,560
You'll have some company.

848
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,040
Oh my god.

849
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:45,800
Wait, that's so scary.

850
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:47,160
This is literally RNG.

851
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:49,120
Oh, I hate this.

852
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,500
My stress is already going up.

853
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:55,420
Each of these dolls are either a safe doll or a cursed one.

854
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:57,480
My stress is already going up.

855
00:38:57,540 --> 00:38:58,140
I hate this.

856
00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:01,720
You will each choose a doll by standing...

857
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:03,140
I'm already anxious.

858
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:07,020
Once the time runs out...

859
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:08,880
Your choice will be locked.

860
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:15,440
The doll chosen by the most players will become the group's selection.

861
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:18,680
And the nature of your doll will be revealed.

862
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:22,960
There are only five dolls of this type left?

863
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:23,140
There are only five dolls of this type left?

864
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:25,100
You'll be safe until your next selection.

865
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:25,880
Bro, what?

866
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:36,380
If the group chooses a cursed doll, you'll face dire consequences as the evil spirits of that doll will be out to get you.

867
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:37,600
Wait, then how do you live?

868
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:38,960
You just run around the circle?

869
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:46,180
The spirits will spawn in the form of multiple dolls who will chase you for five minutes Bro, what the heck?

870
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:47,720
when only one player is eliminated.

871
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:50,260
Each doll has different abilities.

872
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:51,180
That's so scary!

873
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:55,040
Some have the ability to multiply That's gonna be me.

874
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:57,100
And others will hurl fireballs.

875
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:58,060
What?

876
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:07,120
When being chased, you can hide in places like toy boxes, arcade machines, or clothing drawers by clicking on them.

877
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:08,560
Can they like...

878
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:10,460
Can they like open the place?

879
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:13,380
Hiding spots only protect you for a few seconds.

880
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,080
Wait, that's dumb!

881
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:20,080
And each hiding spot will only be used once before disappearing for the remainder of the rounds.

882
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:24,700
So choose wisely when and where you hide.

883
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:29,300
Guys, I'm already stressed out listening to this.

884
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:31,420
The dolls will be held too fast to outrun.

885
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:36,200
Your only option for safety will be the remaining hiding spots.

886
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:41,580
After each elimination a new round will start.

887
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:42,600
Guys...

888
00:40:43,390 --> 00:40:44,100
Let's gotcha!

889
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:46,460
Let's gotcha!

890
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:50,420
Quenching the conjurer's blood thirst.

891
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:53,220
I'm gonna use all of them so no one can hide.

892
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,160
That's so true.

893
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:57,540
That's actually so scary.

894
00:40:57,740 --> 00:40:59,060
Oh my god.

895
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:00,720
That's actually so scary.

896
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:02,040
What?

897
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:04,240
Oh my god.

898
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:09,060
I think it's really really quiet.

899
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:10,000
I don't know which one of them.

900
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:12,780
It's only if you choose the doll that's...

901
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:19,920
I'm listening to other people's I'm listening to other people's I'm listening to other people's I'm listening to other people's I'm listening to other people's right now.

902
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:22,240
It's...

903
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:22,760
Yeah,

904
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:27,760
the fridge is gonna save us!

905
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:28,540
The fridge is gonna save us!

906
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:29,180
The fridge is gonna save us!

907
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:31,720
So we're gonna pick the same square together?

908
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:32,940
So we're gonna pick the same square together?

909
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:34,160
Oh yeah.

910
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:37,720
Okay, remember, use the hiding spots later.

911
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:38,860
Oh, okay.

912
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:40,400
But what if, like...

913
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:44,080
But if we use up all the hiding spaces then nobody can get it.

914
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:47,360
Yeah, but I mean you also can't get it, idiot.

915
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:50,260
Yeah, but the probability-wise...

916
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:54,520
Yeah, I don't think it matters where you stand.

917
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:55,200
I feel like...

918
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:57,620
I don't know.

919
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:03,800
The same odds on each one, but whichever one gets selected, you're competing against everyone.

920
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:07,480
Can we all agree not to use the hiding cluster later in the game?

921
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:08,940
Let's use the hiding cluster.

922
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:13,800
Is everybody in the room chased or just the people on the thing?

923
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:15,760
Why would it be...

924
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:20,520
No, I shouldn't stick with the pros because the pros are faster runners.

925
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:22,540
I'm trying to play DBD and just break their ankles, man.

926
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:24,840
All I'm saying, guys, that doesn't...

927
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:33,840
Guys, if I always stick with the pros, if we get RNG into a core stall, all of them are better players than me.

928
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:37,020
And they would kill me first.

929
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:40,180
They're faster runners.

930
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:41,520
Oh, wow.

931
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:42,080
Holy crap.

932
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:44,440
Oh, my God.

933
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:46,360
I don't know.

934
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:50,940
Yeah, I'm...

935
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:52,440
That's why I'm scared.

936
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:53,940
Do you want to be the big one?

937
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:56,780
So, just spread it out.

938
00:42:58,820 --> 00:43:00,700
What happens if I'm not surviving?

939
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:04,360
My competitor desk is messing me up, guys.

940
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:09,160
Yeah, I think everybody goes there.

941
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:09,800
Oh, okay.

942
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:11,700
It's yours.

943
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:14,120
Those little voices.

944
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:15,660
Those little voices.

945
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:16,660
Those little voices are so strong.

946
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:20,220
I can't.

947
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:21,220
I can't.

948
00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:21,520
I...

949
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:22,880
I survived.

950
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:25,320
I'm surprised I survived as long as I could.

951
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:33,000
I'm surprised I survived this long.

952
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:40,560
It was just...

953
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:41,640
It was a lie.

954
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:43,300
It was a lie.

955
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:44,800
All right.

956
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:45,540
If I stick with...

957
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:47,180
I think I'm going to stick with the crowd then.

958
00:43:47,580 --> 00:43:49,080
The more people...

959
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:52,460
I guess, like, the more people there are in that space...

960
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:53,880
Um...

961
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:55,200
The...

962
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:56,760
Uh...

963
00:43:57,420 --> 00:43:57,980
Oh...

964
00:43:57,980 --> 00:43:58,720
Oh...

965
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:03,040
Who is everybody voting for?

966
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:09,660
If there's a huge amount of people together...

967
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:12,560
Then, like, probability-wise...

968
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:13,000
Maybe?

969
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:21,300
I'm a little stressed.

970
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:23,560
Wait...

971
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:26,200
Ah...

972
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:26,440
Ah...

973
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:27,020
Ah...

974
00:44:27,020 --> 00:44:28,000
Ah...

975
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:32,600
We all suffer the same fate to get there.

976
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:34,900
Oh, God.

977
00:44:35,860 --> 00:44:37,320
I'm actually anxious.

978
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:38,440
I don't know why.

979
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:40,100
I don't know why I'm so anxious.

980
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:41,800
No!

981
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:47,200
There's only one dog?

982
00:44:50,750 --> 00:44:51,690
That's messed up.

983
00:44:53,770 --> 00:44:55,250
That's actually messed up.

984
00:44:55,250 --> 00:44:55,590
That's so messed up, guys.

985
00:44:55,970 --> 00:44:57,890
That's so messed up!

986
00:44:57,990 --> 00:45:02,470
That's so messed up!

987
00:45:02,810 --> 00:45:05,850
How did I... Oh my...

988
00:45:05,850 --> 00:45:06,850
Oh, Chris.

989
00:45:07,130 --> 00:45:08,070
It's me.

990
00:45:08,490 --> 00:45:10,030
It always happens.

991
00:45:10,550 --> 00:45:11,810
To Doki!

992
00:45:16,090 --> 00:45:17,910
The Doki experience.

993
00:45:18,810 --> 00:45:20,030
Right here.

994
00:45:20,850 --> 00:45:23,610
The Doki experience right now.

995
00:45:29,730 --> 00:45:31,990
This is the Doki experience.

996
00:45:32,450 --> 00:45:33,130
Oh, wait.

997
00:45:33,170 --> 00:45:33,950
Everybody's running.

998
00:45:34,910 --> 00:45:36,930
Why is everybody running right now?

999
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:46,210
Five minutes of this.

1000
00:45:46,310 --> 00:45:47,250
FIVE MINUTES OF THIS!

1001
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:53,140
If I stand in the middle...

1002
00:45:53,660 --> 00:45:54,480
Oh, no.

1003
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:55,860
A lot of people are running away.

1004
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:58,640
So that makes me really nervous.

1005
00:45:58,660 --> 00:45:58,840
So that makes me really nervous.

1006
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:02,100
Like, why are people running away?

1007
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:07,600
I wanna stay near the crowd.

1008
00:46:07,980 --> 00:46:08,040
I wanna stay near the crowd.

1009
00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:10,860
Audio for you.

1010
00:46:10,940 --> 00:46:11,160
It's impossible.

1011
00:46:11,540 --> 00:46:11,760
Go!

1012
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:12,220
Go!

1013
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:12,540
Go!

1014
00:46:12,980 --> 00:46:13,600
Oh, what?

1015
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:15,720
What happened?

1016
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:16,240
Run!

1017
00:46:17,540 --> 00:46:18,820
Why are you running?

1018
00:46:19,740 --> 00:46:20,340
Why are you running?

1019
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:21,180
Because it's coming.

1020
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:23,460
You can't even see it!

1021
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:24,040
It's coming!

1022
00:46:24,340 --> 00:46:24,780
Into!

1023
00:46:25,060 --> 00:46:25,500
Into!

1024
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:26,120
Into!

1025
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:26,500
Into!

1026
00:46:26,580 --> 00:46:27,000
Into!

1027
00:46:27,460 --> 00:46:29,360
I didn't know if you were just getting your steps in.

1028
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:30,000
I didn't know if you were just getting your steps in.

1029
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:30,380
Oh, my God.

1030
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:32,700
Yay, free intel!

1031
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:34,000
The herd mentality!

1032
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:37,520
I love following the herd!

1033
00:46:40,460 --> 00:46:43,900
I've been doing the whole lobby here!

1034
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:45,220
Follow the herd!

1035
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:48,800
What does it mean if you're even safe?

1036
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:50,780
What does Sigma?

1037
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:52,440
Follow the herd.

1038
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:53,240
What does Sigma?

1039
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:54,360
Mob strong.

1040
00:46:54,380 --> 00:46:55,220
What does Sigma?

1041
00:46:55,260 --> 00:46:56,520
I like crowds.

1042
00:46:56,900 --> 00:46:57,880
I don't mind.

1043
00:46:58,140 --> 00:46:58,780
Mob.

1044
00:46:58,780 --> 00:47:00,680
That's where I want to be, Derek.

1045
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:03,820
Guys, stop laughing at me.

1046
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:05,640
Two minutes, two minutes for you.

1047
00:47:05,780 --> 00:47:07,000
Just hold, hold, hold.

1048
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:08,520
Holy, I'm normal.

1049
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:09,960
I'm raving.

1050
00:47:10,660 --> 00:47:11,480
Nah, I'm just lying.

1051
00:47:12,220 --> 00:47:13,060
Serpia, you're normal.

1052
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:14,120
Strong.

1053
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:16,040
Together.

1054
00:47:17,140 --> 00:47:17,620
No!

1055
00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:18,380
No!

1056
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:22,620
Nah, that was Aura, bro.

1057
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:24,160
Bro, that was Aura.

1058
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:26,840
Plus 1000 Aura.

1059
00:47:28,780 --> 00:47:29,140
Strong.

1060
00:47:29,340 --> 00:47:29,560
Is he coming?

1061
00:47:31,660 --> 00:47:32,680
Kill someone, bro.

1062
00:47:32,740 --> 00:47:33,560
Just kill someone.

1063
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:38,100
This doll got one tapped, man.

1064
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:39,400
Is he coming?

1065
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:42,260
I'm worried at the end it's going to go like hyperspeed and we're all going to get bopped.

1066
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,200
All 40 of us in here are going to be the ones to get out.

1067
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:52,300
If no one dies, there's going to be 10 rounds until someone dies.

1068
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:53,880
Like, 15 minutes.

1069
00:47:54,460 --> 00:47:55,320
Yeah, we all win.

1070
00:47:55,980 --> 00:47:57,500
They have to split the money.

1071
00:47:58,780 --> 00:48:00,200
They give us each $70,000.

1072
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:01,780
Can we vote someone to be like $70,000?

1073
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:04,140
Not it.

1074
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:06,380
This is my goddamn life!

1075
00:48:07,420 --> 00:48:08,260
Okay, fine.

1076
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:09,220
We'll sacrifice Andre.

1077
00:48:09,380 --> 00:48:11,020
This has to be the lock into me!

1078
00:48:11,020 --> 00:48:11,800
What's his color?

1079
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:14,780
Yo, I'll sacrifice for 40 Gs.

1080
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:16,220
Wait, I have a question.

1081
00:48:16,380 --> 00:48:17,700
I have a question for Scott.

1082
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:18,580
He didn't help me out.

1083
00:48:18,620 --> 00:48:19,900
I'll sacrifice one per person.

1084
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:20,760
Sorry.

1085
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:23,840
I'm losing it.

1086
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:26,060
I'm actually losing it.

1087
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:26,720
So...

1088
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:30,180
Of course the gray person's the weakest.

1089
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:32,820
I'm stuck in Purgatory!

1090
00:48:34,460 --> 00:48:37,180
This is frickin' Purgatory!

1091
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:40,040
This is frickin' Purgatory!

1092
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:41,140
I don't know.

1093
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:43,660
There's no man once per round.

1094
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:50,080
If you're safe, is that actually a thing?

1095
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:51,260
Is it even safe?

1096
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:53,300
Dude, I'm nervous.

1097
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:53,820
I don't know.

1098
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:55,900
I don't know where it is.

1099
00:48:55,900 --> 00:48:56,920
I don't know where it is.

1100
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:58,860
Some people are here, though.

1101
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:00,780
Can we do a head count, guys?

1102
00:49:00,820 --> 00:49:03,600
It has to be like one person and then we're free!

1103
00:49:04,260 --> 00:49:05,040
That's what it really is!

1104
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:05,520
50 seconds.

1105
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:05,880
Just wait.

1106
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:08,120
Marco!

1107
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:08,600
Marco!

1108
00:49:10,020 --> 00:49:10,500
Polo!

1109
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:10,980
Polo!

1110
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:11,200
Marco!

1111
00:49:12,100 --> 00:49:12,580
Polo!

1112
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:15,240
Guys, always go to the same color.

1113
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:15,820
Polo!

1114
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:16,960
Polo!

1115
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:18,920
It's coming!

1116
00:49:19,060 --> 00:49:19,540
It's coming!

1117
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:19,800
It's coming!

1118
00:49:21,260 --> 00:49:21,960
He's coming!

1119
00:49:22,060 --> 00:49:22,540
He's coming!

1120
00:49:22,540 --> 00:49:22,620
He's coming!

1121
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:23,700
He's coming!

1122
00:49:24,340 --> 00:49:24,800
Polo!

1123
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:24,880
Polo!

1124
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:24,940
It's coming!

1125
00:49:27,820 --> 00:49:29,020
He's behind us!

1126
00:49:33,540 --> 00:49:34,000
Polo!

1127
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:34,460
Polo!

1128
00:49:34,460 --> 00:49:34,480
Polo!

1129
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:34,960
Polo!

1130
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:36,060
Polo!

1131
00:49:36,060 --> 00:49:36,260
Polo!

1132
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:36,780
Polo!

1133
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:37,520
Polo!

1134
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:37,520
Polo!

1135
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:37,520
Polo!

1136
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:38,820
Polo!

1137
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:39,340
Polo!

1138
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:41,180
Run into it!

1139
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:41,860
Let's run into it!

1140
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:42,640
Oh my God!

1141
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:44,560
Oh my God!

1142
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:47,100
It hit me!

1143
00:49:47,180 --> 00:49:47,560
It hit me!

1144
00:49:48,100 --> 00:49:48,560
Woah!

1145
00:49:48,580 --> 00:49:48,920
Woah!

1146
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:49,340
Woah!

1147
00:49:50,660 --> 00:49:51,880
I saw someone die here!

1148
00:49:52,540 --> 00:49:52,780
I got hit!

1149
00:49:54,260 --> 00:49:54,860
What?

1150
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:57,180
They didn't get one?

1151
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:00,800
How do I come back to the room?

1152
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:01,860
I got hit.

1153
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,500
I got hit twice by it.

1154
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:04,860
Oh my god.

1155
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:07,240
My health restored.

1156
00:50:09,060 --> 00:50:10,780
That was so stressful.

1157
00:50:11,740 --> 00:50:13,380
That was so stressful.

1158
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:14,700
That was so stressful.

1159
00:50:14,700 --> 00:50:17,440
Where is the entrance?

1160
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:19,480
TPS, TPS, TPS.

1161
00:50:20,340 --> 00:50:21,120
Oh, it's here.

1162
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:22,460
Oh.

1163
00:50:22,820 --> 00:50:23,600
Oh, we're back.

1164
00:50:24,260 --> 00:50:24,720
What?

1165
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:28,100
Do we go all on the same line?

1166
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:29,860
Purple.

1167
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:33,180
Blue, blue, blue, blue.

1168
00:50:35,540 --> 00:50:37,820
Blue, blue, blue, blue.

1169
00:50:39,180 --> 00:50:40,760
Blue, blue, blue, blue.

1170
00:50:40,820 --> 00:50:41,280
Blue, blue, blue, blue.

1171
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:41,560
Blue, blue, blue, blue.

1172
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:42,180
I knew it, I knew it.

1173
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:43,240
It's fine.

1174
00:50:43,380 --> 00:50:44,160
I knew it.

1175
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:44,960
I knew it.

1176
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:52,800
It's okay.

1177
00:50:53,620 --> 00:50:54,620
There's a crowd.

1178
00:50:57,160 --> 00:50:58,400
There's a crowd.

1179
00:50:58,400 --> 00:50:59,380
There's a crowd.

1180
00:51:00,700 --> 00:51:01,140
There's a crowd.

1181
00:51:01,140 --> 00:51:01,920
That's all sweet.

1182
00:51:02,420 --> 00:51:04,800
It's going to be me, right?

1183
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:05,500
It's going to be me.

1184
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:07,860
I'm okay!

1185
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:09,260
I'm okay!

1186
00:51:15,450 --> 00:51:15,890
Nice.

1187
00:51:16,710 --> 00:51:18,930
Wait, all of us have chosen the same?

1188
00:51:19,750 --> 00:51:21,110
Wait, what?

1189
00:51:21,790 --> 00:51:22,410
Wait, what?

1190
00:51:23,690 --> 00:51:25,050
Oh no, not yet.

1191
00:51:25,950 --> 00:51:26,410
Where did we choose this?

1192
00:51:26,730 --> 00:51:28,010
Where did we choose this?

1193
00:51:29,270 --> 00:51:31,090
No, it's going to be good.

1194
00:51:31,430 --> 00:51:32,090
It's going to be good.

1195
00:51:32,330 --> 00:51:33,130
It's going to be good.

1196
00:51:33,290 --> 00:51:34,090
Not too bad.

1197
00:51:34,230 --> 00:51:39,190
I mean, at least there's no RNG on what we choose.

1198
00:51:39,410 --> 00:51:39,850
Okay.

1199
00:51:42,290 --> 00:51:43,670
There's a huge crowd here.

1200
00:51:45,350 --> 00:51:45,790
Okay.

1201
00:51:46,650 --> 00:51:47,290
I'm confused.

1202
00:51:48,370 --> 00:51:48,810
I'm...

1203
00:51:50,170 --> 00:51:50,610
What?

1204
00:51:52,010 --> 00:51:52,330
No!

1205
00:51:56,630 --> 00:51:57,510
That's me, right?

1206
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:04,700
Okay, bye-bye.

1207
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,080
That's me, that's me!

1208
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:08,260
We should stop listening to the loud guys.

1209
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:09,560
He's coming, he's coming!

1210
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:12,200
This thing is fast.

1211
00:52:12,740 --> 00:52:14,180
Is that all of us?

1212
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:16,920
Wait, is it like majority?

1213
00:52:17,220 --> 00:52:18,060
I'm so confused.

1214
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:19,220
It's for everybody!

1215
00:52:20,540 --> 00:52:21,560
Is it just one?

1216
00:52:23,260 --> 00:52:24,260
I'm dead, I'm dead!

1217
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:25,380
I hear him, I hear him!

1218
00:52:26,320 --> 00:52:27,560
I'd rather stay with the group.

1219
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:29,400
I hear him, I hear him!

1220
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:33,540
We got this.

1221
00:52:34,140 --> 00:52:35,120
Oh, there's a group there.

1222
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,320
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

1223
00:52:38,180 --> 00:52:39,020
Coming, coming, coming!

1224
00:52:40,020 --> 00:52:40,640
He's coming, coming, coming!

1225
00:52:41,140 --> 00:52:43,460
He's coming, coming, coming!

1226
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:46,340
This doll is going to have a different ability than the last one.

1227
00:52:46,540 --> 00:52:46,940
He's coming?

1228
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:47,920
He's coming or not?

1229
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:50,720
He's coming or not?

1230
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:52,940
This doll has kill aura.

1231
00:52:53,180 --> 00:52:53,860
He's coming or not?

1232
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:55,480
Is she coming?

1233
00:52:56,520 --> 00:52:58,840
Don't attract her, don't attract her!

1234
00:52:59,140 --> 00:53:00,720
So you might not be able to outrun it very well.

1235
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:02,980
I'm sure we can still outrun it eventually.

1236
00:53:03,860 --> 00:53:04,540
Oh my god!

1237
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:07,260
He's coming, he's coming, he's coming!

1238
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:08,000
Why are you guys yelling?

1239
00:53:08,740 --> 00:53:09,920
I got you.

1240
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:11,360
Oh!

1241
00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:14,360
He got somebody!

1242
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:16,420
Oh my god!

1243
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:20,080
Oh my god!

1244
00:53:21,820 --> 00:53:23,000
Oh my god!

1245
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:24,920
Oh my god!

1246
00:53:25,380 --> 00:53:26,200
Another round!

1247
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:28,840
At least we won't have to be here for 50 minutes.

1248
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:29,560
It's so tight!

1249
00:53:29,580 --> 00:53:30,460
We played!

1250
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:32,380
Oh my god!

1251
00:53:32,780 --> 00:53:34,500
That's probably the worst part of all of this.

1252
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:37,760
The save dolls are just pointless.

1253
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:40,500
This is so stressful.

1254
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:41,300
Yeah.

1255
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:44,360
Oh man.

1256
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:46,680
Anyone but the weak will get gone.

1257
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:48,080
Dude, I saw this!

1258
00:53:49,580 --> 00:53:52,280
You do not go back to the middle!

1259
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:53,820
I was dictating!

1260
00:53:54,060 --> 00:53:55,320
I was getting scared!

1261
00:53:55,540 --> 00:53:56,080
I was alone!

1262
00:53:56,300 --> 00:53:57,000
We got it!

1263
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:57,560
We got it!

1264
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:01,600
We got it!

1265
00:54:01,660 --> 00:54:02,240
We got it!

1266
00:54:08,180 --> 00:54:08,660
AAAAHHH!!

1267
00:54:11,620 --> 00:54:12,100
Aghhh!

1268
00:54:17,820 --> 00:54:18,520
We're back.

1269
00:54:18,820 --> 00:54:19,120
Alright.

1270
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:21,460
Let's fucking go!

1271
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:23,340
Yes we are ready!

1272
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:24,100
Let's fucking go.

1273
00:54:24,180 --> 00:54:24,460
Let's go!

1274
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:27,140
I dont know which side to go.

1275
00:54:27,560 --> 00:54:28,500
Let's keep going!

1276
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:29,820
I can't move.

1277
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:38,780
Watch that angle to the left, we need someone to watch that angle over here.

1278
00:54:39,100 --> 00:54:40,380
I don't like this...

1279
00:54:41,050 --> 00:54:42,380
Just keep swimming!

1280
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:44,480
Just keep swimming!

1281
00:54:44,860 --> 00:54:46,160
Just keep swimming!

1282
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:51,740
I don't like that.

1283
00:54:52,220 --> 00:54:53,120
Are you running?

1284
00:54:53,380 --> 00:54:56,020
Are you running?

1285
00:54:56,780 --> 00:54:58,320
No, no, no, we're fine.

1286
00:54:58,560 --> 00:54:59,780
It's a terrible spot!

1287
00:54:59,780 --> 00:55:00,940
It's a terrible spot!

1288
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:02,920
It's actually not terrible.

1289
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:05,000
It's a terrible spot!

1290
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:06,520
No, it's the best as fuck!

1291
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:11,840
Guys, I'm scared, I don't want to die.

1292
00:55:12,860 --> 00:55:13,660
Run the dog!

1293
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:14,740
RUN THE DOG!

1294
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:25,560
They're trolling, they're trolling, it's a lie.

1295
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:26,240
They're trolling, dude.

1296
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:27,140
They're trolling, dude.

1297
00:55:29,780 --> 00:55:31,500
I got the cry of help, though.

1298
00:55:31,900 --> 00:55:34,280
The cry of help.

1299
00:55:34,520 --> 00:55:35,960
The cry of help.

1300
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:37,540
I'm serious!

1301
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:38,520
How many dogs are there?

1302
00:55:38,540 --> 00:55:39,340
Multiple, multiple.

1303
00:55:39,860 --> 00:55:42,560
There were two before, there were two before.

1304
00:55:43,140 --> 00:55:44,360
Oh my god.

1305
00:55:44,700 --> 00:55:45,780
Hold the corner, hold the corner!

1306
00:55:46,100 --> 00:55:48,300
The cry of help there was incredible.

1307
00:55:56,280 --> 00:55:56,800
Panic!

1308
00:55:57,100 --> 00:55:57,620
Panic!

1309
00:55:57,620 --> 00:55:58,040
Fear!

1310
00:55:58,740 --> 00:55:59,260
Panic!

1311
00:55:59,620 --> 00:55:59,720
Fear!

1312
00:55:59,780 --> 00:56:03,800
What is going on?

1313
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:04,660
What is going on?

1314
00:56:04,660 --> 00:56:06,540
Absolute fear and mayhem.

1315
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:07,460
Absolute fear and mayhem.

1316
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:08,140
That's what...

1317
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:10,820
That's what's going on.

1318
00:56:10,980 --> 00:56:11,440
Oh my god.

1319
00:56:12,460 --> 00:56:12,860
Oh my god.

1320
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:16,920
Oh my god.

1321
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:22,060
This is like the Stanford Prison Experiment.

1322
00:56:22,460 --> 00:56:22,760
This is like the Stanford Prison Experiment.

1323
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:23,260
Oh my god.

1324
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:26,900
I swear, son!

1325
00:56:27,260 --> 00:56:27,420
I swear, son!

1326
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:29,680
Researchers are gonna see this.

1327
00:56:29,780 --> 00:56:30,420
They're gonna study this!

1328
00:56:35,780 --> 00:56:36,960
I'm going through this game.

1329
00:56:37,220 --> 00:56:38,020
I'm going through this game.

1330
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:41,560
Oh no.

1331
00:56:41,900 --> 00:56:42,740
Oh god.

1332
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:44,900
Oh my god.

1333
00:56:45,900 --> 00:56:47,840
Go right, go right, go right!

1334
00:56:48,180 --> 00:56:49,800
I peaced away from the group.

1335
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,660
I peaced away from the group.

1336
00:56:51,820 --> 00:56:52,160
Guys.

1337
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:56,240
I peaced away from the group.

1338
00:56:56,320 --> 00:56:57,560
I'm so scared.

1339
00:56:58,540 --> 00:56:59,100
No.

1340
00:56:59,780 --> 00:57:02,080
Other way, other way.

1341
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:03,000
Run, other way, other way!

1342
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:04,720
Oh my god, Ollie!

1343
00:57:05,060 --> 00:57:06,780
Oh my god, there's multiple cuts!

1344
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:07,840
Ollie, Ollie!

1345
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:09,500
Oh, no.

1346
00:57:10,380 --> 00:57:11,300
Oh my god.

1347
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:13,860
There's multiple cuts.

1348
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:18,220
We got eliminated.

1349
00:57:20,620 --> 00:57:22,880
Ollie got shanked.

1350
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:23,700
Awesome!

1351
00:57:25,060 --> 00:57:26,160
You're just a bad luck!

1352
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:28,160
Good luck!

1353
00:57:57,240 --> 00:57:58,600
Trust me!

1354
00:57:58,600 --> 00:57:59,180
Trust me!

1355
00:57:59,260 --> 00:57:59,700
Trust me!

1356
00:58:12,700 --> 00:58:14,500
Here we go again.

1357
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:16,700
It doesn't matter.

1358
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:17,440
It's majority.

1359
00:58:18,020 --> 00:58:19,520
It's always majority.

1360
00:58:19,640 --> 00:58:20,760
That's the thing.

1361
00:58:20,920 --> 00:58:22,280
It doesn't matter.

1362
00:58:23,380 --> 00:58:25,060
It's literally majority picks.

1363
00:58:25,260 --> 00:58:27,000
Everybody still has to run.

1364
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:30,520
So it doesn't matter if you pick a safe doll.

1365
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:36,780
If the majority picks a bad doll, it's over.

1366
00:58:42,420 --> 00:58:46,220
No matter what, somebody has to die.

1367
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:57,380
8 more to go.

1368
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:00,860
8 more to go.

1369
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:01,740
I'm fine.

1370
00:59:02,700 --> 00:59:03,760
There's nothing here.

1371
00:59:06,360 --> 00:59:08,900
There's like 8 more dolls to go.

1372
00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:10,340
They're coming.

1373
00:59:10,820 --> 00:59:10,900
They're coming.

1374
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:11,440
They're coming.

1375
00:59:12,420 --> 00:59:13,940
Anyone on the right?

1376
00:59:14,460 --> 00:59:17,160
We don't want to run into anything too.

1377
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:17,860
Okay.

1378
00:59:19,020 --> 00:59:19,840
Trust me.

1379
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:25,480
I hope it means like the dolls are fast.

1380
00:59:25,780 --> 00:59:27,080
They kill people faster.

1381
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:29,460
Because each round is faster.

1382
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:30,680
I'm so scared.

1383
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:34,580
Oh, we're so good.

1384
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:35,320
They want that info.

1385
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:35,800
I don't know.

1386
00:59:36,140 --> 00:59:36,660
Hi.

1387
00:59:38,180 --> 00:59:38,320
Hi.

1388
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:42,820
Apparently the suits are not very safe.

1389
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:44,860
They're running on the left.

1390
00:59:45,380 --> 00:59:46,820
They'll camp you.

1391
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:48,100
They'll camp you?

1392
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:49,960
Then there's no point in having hiding spots.

1393
00:59:50,700 --> 00:59:51,580
Okay, you know what?

1394
00:59:52,080 --> 00:59:52,600
Go!

1395
00:59:52,600 --> 00:59:53,760
Okay, run, run, run.

1396
00:59:54,260 --> 00:59:54,960
We'll be right back.

1397
00:59:56,080 --> 00:59:56,580
They're beaches.

1398
00:59:57,240 --> 00:59:58,020
Okay, okay, okay.

1399
01:00:00,120 --> 01:00:00,800
My heart.

1400
01:00:01,160 --> 01:00:02,280
My poor heart.

1401
01:00:05,360 --> 01:00:06,040
Oh, boy.

1402
01:00:06,700 --> 01:00:07,560
We're chill, I think.

1403
01:00:07,940 --> 01:00:08,580
It's kind of clear.

1404
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:11,740
But I don't know where it went.

1405
01:00:12,780 --> 01:00:13,740
Guys, were we locked in there?

1406
01:00:13,740 --> 01:00:14,220
We're tilling, guys.

1407
01:00:15,540 --> 01:00:16,700
It looks like we're okay.

1408
01:00:17,820 --> 01:00:18,520
Play the corner.

1409
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:20,120
One more.

1410
01:00:23,660 --> 01:00:24,960
How many hearts?

1411
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:25,260
How many hearts?

1412
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:26,880
It does half a heart.

1413
01:00:26,980 --> 01:00:27,680
You can get hit four times.

1414
01:00:29,120 --> 01:00:30,400
Take off for the team.

1415
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:31,180
Take off for the team.

1416
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:33,760
Thank you for the 10,000 biddies!

1417
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:37,620
Thank you for following my therapy.

1418
01:00:39,900 --> 01:00:40,300
Sam?

1419
01:00:43,120 --> 01:00:43,760
Are you running?

1420
01:00:43,880 --> 01:00:44,420
Are you okay?

1421
01:00:44,920 --> 01:00:46,800
There's two dolls that direction, but they turned left.

1422
01:00:47,020 --> 01:00:47,960
There's two dolls that direction.

1423
01:00:48,180 --> 01:00:50,860
I think we're good over here right now.

1424
01:00:50,860 --> 01:00:53,100
Are they faster than you running?

1425
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:53,780
Definitely faster.

1426
01:00:54,740 --> 01:00:55,880
Don't leave the group.

1427
01:00:55,880 --> 01:00:56,600
The dolls will find you.

1428
01:00:58,080 --> 01:00:59,340
Don't leave the group.

1429
01:00:59,420 --> 01:01:01,400
I left the group and I got fucking tapped.

1430
01:01:02,980 --> 01:01:03,940
Don't leave the group.

1431
01:01:04,020 --> 01:01:04,780
Together always.

1432
01:01:06,300 --> 01:01:07,980
You don't regen.

1433
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:09,040
No, you don't regen.

1434
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:12,420
Somebody sacrificed Doki.

1435
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:13,840
Wait, why me?

1436
01:01:16,420 --> 01:01:17,720
I didn't do anything.

1437
01:01:18,040 --> 01:01:18,900
I'm just a baby.

1438
01:01:19,460 --> 01:01:20,340
Doki is cool.

1439
01:01:20,860 --> 01:01:22,440
Music is getting very loud.

1440
01:01:23,220 --> 01:01:29,900
I don't have any music.

1441
01:01:30,100 --> 01:01:31,140
Doki alone.

1442
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:33,420
Is that why there's music?

1443
01:01:33,740 --> 01:01:36,340
Is anybody being hunted?

1444
01:01:36,560 --> 01:01:37,160
No.

1445
01:01:38,560 --> 01:01:39,920
Hi Sean.

1446
01:01:46,560 --> 01:01:47,580
Negative behavior.

1447
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:49,200
We'll see you.

1448
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:51,680
No pee-pee.

1449
01:01:51,800 --> 01:01:52,380
No pee-pee.

1450
01:01:52,820 --> 01:01:56,080
No pee-pee.

1451
01:01:56,080 --> 01:01:56,880
Pee-pee your pants.

1452
01:01:57,160 --> 01:01:59,500
Pee-pee my pants.

1453
01:01:59,740 --> 01:01:59,920
Shut up.

1454
01:02:00,260 --> 01:02:03,060
Go, go, go.

1455
01:02:04,360 --> 01:02:05,360
Nothing to be afraid of.

1456
01:02:05,360 --> 01:02:05,620
We're chilling.

1457
01:02:06,120 --> 01:02:07,680
No, we're not chilling.

1458
01:02:07,840 --> 01:02:09,340
I do nap.

1459
01:02:10,620 --> 01:02:12,540
I do not chill.

1460
01:02:12,540 --> 01:02:13,160
I do not chill.

1461
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:17,080
I do not chill.

1462
01:02:17,700 --> 01:02:18,240
I do not chill anymore.

1463
01:02:18,780 --> 01:02:19,220
Okay.

1464
01:02:20,660 --> 01:02:21,100
Okay.

1465
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:21,880
Okay.

1466
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:23,640
Yes, we're not chill.

1467
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:24,940
Oh my God.

1468
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:27,700
Do not chill.

1469
01:02:31,580 --> 01:02:32,020
Do not chill.

1470
01:02:32,020 --> 01:02:32,780
Do not chill.

1471
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:33,200
Do not chill.

1472
01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:36,860
I messed up the stairs.

1473
01:02:37,080 --> 01:02:37,800
I messed up the stairs.

1474
01:02:37,860 --> 01:02:38,780
I'm not in the group.

1475
01:02:38,840 --> 01:02:39,960
I'm not in the group.

1476
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:41,100
I messed up the stairs.

1477
01:02:41,100 --> 01:02:42,240
I messed up the stairs.

1478
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:43,100
I messed up the stairs.

1479
01:02:43,100 --> 01:02:43,640
I messed up the stairs.

1480
01:02:43,640 --> 01:02:44,080
I'm gonna do the kanga.

1481
01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:46,200
I'm gonna do the kanga.

1482
01:02:46,760 --> 01:02:47,180
Everybody kanga.

1483
01:02:47,180 --> 01:02:47,200
Everybody kanga.

1484
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:47,880
My God.

1485
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:48,900
The mic is bad.

1486
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:52,420
Guys, how do we get intel on everybody's yank.

1487
01:02:55,100 --> 01:02:56,760
Oh God, this is not intel.

1488
01:02:56,920 --> 01:03:00,400
This is just a school trip that you can't get off of.

1489
01:03:00,540 --> 01:03:01,760
You can't get out.

1490
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:03,080
This is worse.

1491
01:03:06,420 --> 01:03:07,580
This is worse.

1492
01:03:07,980 --> 01:03:09,960
It's like a mandatory school trip.

1493
01:03:17,840 --> 01:03:21,420
I sure hope the next one is a safe doll.

1494
01:03:23,140 --> 01:03:26,660
I sure hope it's a safe doll.

1495
01:03:26,660 --> 01:03:26,800
Karma!

1496
01:03:37,960 --> 01:03:40,260
He actually got Karma!

1497
01:03:40,260 --> 01:03:41,620
Yeah, he got it!

1498
01:03:43,160 --> 01:03:44,360
I'm gonna throw up.

1499
01:03:44,420 --> 01:03:45,400
I'm gonna throw up.

1500
01:03:45,460 --> 01:03:45,960
I hate this.

1501
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:51,540
Steve actually got Karma.

1502
01:03:51,940 --> 01:03:53,640
That's so funny.

1503
01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:54,840
I hate this!

1504
01:04:02,140 --> 01:04:02,860
This is worse.

1505
01:04:05,560 --> 01:04:06,680
This is worse.

1506
01:04:09,600 --> 01:04:11,840
This is worse.

1507
01:04:12,980 --> 01:04:16,740
This is it.

1508
01:04:17,040 --> 01:04:18,260
I'm after Abe.

1509
01:04:18,560 --> 01:04:22,700
Are you goddamn- It doesn't matter anyway, guys.

1510
01:04:22,980 --> 01:04:24,020
No, what am I saying?

1511
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:25,020
It doesn't matter.

1512
01:04:25,020 --> 01:04:25,020
It's better.

1513
01:04:25,700 --> 01:04:26,580
It's majority.

1514
01:04:27,080 --> 01:04:29,900
I feel like when people pick safe dolls, they should be safe.

1515
01:04:31,360 --> 01:04:37,720
I feel like if you pick safe dolls, you should automatically be safe.

1516
01:04:38,540 --> 01:04:41,180
Barpo, Barpo, you went alone last time.

1517
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:47,000
We should not be forced to do this.

1518
01:04:49,180 --> 01:04:51,600
We should not be forced.

1519
01:04:51,860 --> 01:04:53,140
Why even vote?

1520
01:04:55,020 --> 01:04:56,440
I don't know why.

1521
01:04:56,840 --> 01:05:06,520
Yeah, but if you have a safe doll, you shouldn't be forced to do this again.

1522
01:05:08,540 --> 01:05:10,860
I feel like he might be revived.

1523
01:05:12,300 --> 01:05:13,020
Is he coming?

1524
01:05:13,480 --> 01:05:14,360
Is he coming?

1525
01:05:16,040 --> 01:05:18,500
Oh my god, the illusion choice.

1526
01:05:18,680 --> 01:05:19,800
This is the illusion choice.

1527
01:05:19,840 --> 01:05:21,080
My heart can't take this.

1528
01:05:25,020 --> 01:05:26,860
You vote, we all lose.

1529
01:05:34,160 --> 01:05:38,320
It's a guy that wants to be my wife.

1530
01:05:38,580 --> 01:05:38,920
No!

1531
01:05:39,620 --> 01:05:40,360
No!

1532
01:05:42,060 --> 01:05:42,520
No!

1533
01:05:48,120 --> 01:05:49,660
Six more to go.

1534
01:05:50,080 --> 01:05:51,260
What is this?

1535
01:05:52,340 --> 01:05:54,440
Six more to go.

1536
01:05:58,420 --> 01:06:02,140
This guy forgot, lost his male wife.

1537
01:06:05,560 --> 01:06:11,160
It doesn't matter where we're... they randomly put us... they randomly group us out.

1538
01:06:11,320 --> 01:06:14,280
It doesn't matter where we're...

1539
01:06:14,280 --> 01:06:17,060
Cheap, he died in front of me in my arms.

1540
01:06:17,120 --> 01:06:19,960
It doesn't matter where, like, you get grouped up into.

1541
01:06:19,960 --> 01:06:21,540
It's, like, random.

1542
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:23,500
Wait, no, no, Cheap, it actually was invisible.

1543
01:06:23,820 --> 01:06:26,040
No, it was invisible, Cheap, I swear.

1544
01:06:26,160 --> 01:06:27,880
It was actually not there and then spawned in.

1545
01:06:27,900 --> 01:06:29,100
Don't do black, don't do black, don't do black, don't do black.

1546
01:06:29,560 --> 01:06:30,820
Listen, the trick is...

1547
01:06:32,920 --> 01:06:34,380
Alright, I'll be up next to this door.

1548
01:06:34,680 --> 01:06:41,000
But I, I, I actually got caught on something and the doll was face to face with me and walked by me instead, so...

1549
01:06:41,880 --> 01:06:42,960
I'm ready, Banzai.

1550
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:44,360
Yup, yup, yup.

1551
01:06:44,700 --> 01:06:46,040
So, like, able to damage you.

1552
01:06:48,420 --> 01:06:49,280
Oh, no!

1553
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:49,800
Oh, no!

1554
01:06:49,800 --> 01:06:50,260
It doesn't matter.

1555
01:06:53,260 --> 01:06:55,580
I'm not even on that, but we all get caught.

1556
01:07:01,040 --> 01:07:03,020
This one is, this one is very hard, you guys.

1557
01:07:03,140 --> 01:07:04,320
No, it doesn't exist.

1558
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:05,300
Alright, alright, alright.

1559
01:07:05,740 --> 01:07:07,620
We know the route, we know the route, guys.

1560
01:07:07,840 --> 01:07:08,300
We know...

1561
01:07:08,300 --> 01:07:09,940
We know the route, we know the route, we know the route.

1562
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:11,140
We know the route, guys, we know the route.

1563
01:07:11,360 --> 01:07:11,660
We know the route...

1564
01:07:11,660 --> 01:07:12,480
To the corner, to the corner.

1565
01:07:12,580 --> 01:07:13,460
To the corner, to the corner.

1566
01:07:14,040 --> 01:07:14,440
We know the route.

1567
01:07:15,700 --> 01:07:16,860
Hold up, hold up.

1568
01:07:16,860 --> 01:07:17,360
I'm in the middle.

1569
01:07:18,160 --> 01:07:18,960
I'm in the middle.

1570
01:07:19,840 --> 01:07:21,340
Because I don't contribute.

1571
01:07:25,140 --> 01:07:25,660
No, no, no.

1572
01:07:25,900 --> 01:07:28,420
No, no, no.

1573
01:07:28,520 --> 01:07:33,580
We know Dundrills.

1574
01:07:34,420 --> 01:07:36,400
I'm a leech.

1575
01:07:38,660 --> 01:07:40,180
I'm just here to leech.

1576
01:07:40,180 --> 01:07:40,900
I'm good, I'm good.

1577
01:07:42,120 --> 01:07:43,140
I'm safe, no worries.

1578
01:07:43,800 --> 01:07:44,640
Oh my god.

1579
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:46,320
Dukie rat tactics.

1580
01:07:52,640 --> 01:07:53,520
Of course.

1581
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:55,320
They're running, they're running, they're running.

1582
01:07:57,140 --> 01:07:59,360
They're running away from the hot pack in a minute.

1583
01:08:00,600 --> 01:08:02,200
Oh my god.

1584
01:08:05,900 --> 01:08:06,940
They're running away.

1585
01:08:07,700 --> 01:08:09,040
I'm running for nothing, bro.

1586
01:08:09,120 --> 01:08:09,740
I'm running for nothing.

1587
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:15,700
Stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it.

1588
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:16,480
Stop it, stop it, guys.

1589
01:08:16,700 --> 01:08:17,820
Intersection, intersection.

1590
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:20,000
Nah, fuck intersection.

1591
01:08:20,580 --> 01:08:21,800
Stop it, stop it, stop it.

1592
01:08:21,860 --> 01:08:22,680
Stop it, stop it, stop it.

1593
01:08:23,020 --> 01:08:25,640
Stop it, stop it, stop it.

1594
01:08:25,880 --> 01:08:26,700
Hold the corner.

1595
01:08:29,440 --> 01:08:30,740
Corner, corner, corner.

1596
01:08:31,100 --> 01:08:32,420
It's such a grief, bro.

1597
01:08:34,040 --> 01:08:35,460
Did you guys see anything?

1598
01:08:36,020 --> 01:08:37,760
Yeah, we got shot at.

1599
01:08:37,760 --> 01:08:38,040
Why didn't we see anything?

1600
01:08:39,940 --> 01:08:41,720
I was like, we're gonna go for a little- Oh, sorry.

1601
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:44,320
The little kid behind the bar.

1602
01:08:44,320 --> 01:08:45,020
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1603
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:47,900
Where's my mom?

1604
01:08:48,220 --> 01:08:49,480
The kid at the supermarket?

1605
01:08:51,840 --> 01:08:54,100
The kid at the supermarket?

1606
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:55,900
I don't know.

1607
01:08:55,900 --> 01:09:01,680
You guys, let me- The kid at the supermarket.

1608
01:09:01,680 --> 01:09:02,680
The kid at the supermarket, where's my mom?

1609
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:02,960
Sam?

1610
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:03,460
Sam?

1611
01:09:03,740 --> 01:09:09,840
Sam's balls are on the ground dude, that's crazy.

1612
01:09:10,260 --> 01:09:10,260
Sam!

1613
01:09:10,500 --> 01:09:11,740
Sam's balls are on the ground dude, that's crazy.

1614
01:09:11,740 --> 01:09:11,880
Sam!

1615
01:09:11,880 --> 01:09:12,920
Sam's balls are on the ground dude, that's crazy.

1616
01:09:13,680 --> 01:09:16,060
Bro I thought game day 2 was bad.

1617
01:09:16,140 --> 01:09:18,060
I don't know, this is worse.

1618
01:09:18,700 --> 01:09:21,400
This is actually much worse than day 2.

1619
01:09:22,460 --> 01:09:25,280
I think everybody can kill the doll.

1620
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:26,940
Sam just said info, we're good.

1621
01:09:27,260 --> 01:09:28,020
This is worse.

1622
01:09:30,100 --> 01:09:32,480
And I have to listen to the voices.

1623
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:39,080
I need an adult.

1624
01:09:39,760 --> 01:09:41,320
I need an adult guys.

1625
01:09:42,840 --> 01:09:43,960
The voices.

1626
01:09:46,900 --> 01:09:48,620
I'm just worried about the situation.

1627
01:09:48,660 --> 01:09:53,300
We're waiting here, one comes, we run the other way and get totally pinched.

1628
01:09:53,320 --> 01:09:53,780
They're running, they're running.

1629
01:09:53,820 --> 01:09:55,080
They're running, they're running.

1630
01:09:58,020 --> 01:10:02,120
Watch out for being pinched, watch in front of you.

1631
01:10:02,320 --> 01:10:03,640
Following Sam, following Sam.

1632
01:10:04,420 --> 01:10:05,920
Everyone go the same way.

1633
01:10:06,220 --> 01:10:08,220
Don't split, don't split, don't split.

1634
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:09,820
Don't split guys, don't split, don't split.

1635
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:11,520
Sam, Sam, Sam.

1636
01:10:12,980 --> 01:10:13,780
Did you guys hear that?

1637
01:10:14,620 --> 01:10:16,340
There's so many people.

1638
01:10:17,580 --> 01:10:18,640
Sam, Sam, Sam.

1639
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:19,100
Sam, please save us.

1640
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:23,060
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

1641
01:10:24,020 --> 01:10:25,440
Sam, no, no, this is a terrible corner.

1642
01:10:25,440 --> 01:10:26,320
They can sneak up behind us.

1643
01:10:26,340 --> 01:10:27,560
I like it.

1644
01:10:29,320 --> 01:10:30,700
Let's go to the center, go to the center.

1645
01:10:30,980 --> 01:10:33,860
Or, or, or, or...

1646
01:10:38,980 --> 01:10:43,080
Don't let me go.

1647
01:10:43,460 --> 01:10:54,960
Don't let me go.

1648
01:10:55,440 --> 01:10:55,700
Nice corner!

1649
01:10:56,500 --> 01:10:58,020
Nice corner!

1650
01:11:13,460 --> 01:11:18,080
I am 4.3!

1651
01:11:18,360 --> 01:11:18,800
Pornen!

1652
01:11:18,940 --> 01:11:19,580
Pornen!

1653
01:11:19,740 --> 01:11:19,940
Pornen!

1654
01:11:20,240 --> 01:11:21,840
I can't believe it!

1655
01:11:23,320 --> 01:11:24,320
TwitchSames is back!

1656
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:25,960
TwitchSames is back!

1657
01:11:26,760 --> 01:11:27,340
Oh, there's one!

1658
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:35,440
Save,

1659
01:11:43,980 --> 01:11:45,280
save, save, save, save, guys.

1660
01:11:46,440 --> 01:11:48,360
Still run, still run, still run.

1661
01:11:48,660 --> 01:11:49,920
Still run, still run.

1662
01:11:52,740 --> 01:11:53,900
I sold a player.

1663
01:11:54,160 --> 01:11:55,760
We're good, we're good, we're good, we're good, we're good.

1664
01:11:56,360 --> 01:11:58,160
Behind, behind, behind, behind, behind!

1665
01:11:59,360 --> 01:12:00,000
Ahh, trolled.

1666
01:12:01,080 --> 01:12:02,120
Troll, troll, trolled.

1667
01:12:09,140 --> 01:12:11,760
Lime, lime, lime, lime, lime, lime.

1668
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:14,240
Both lime, both lime, both lime.

1669
01:12:15,240 --> 01:12:16,380
Both lime, lime!

1670
01:12:17,220 --> 01:12:17,940
Give it a kiss, give it a kiss.

1671
01:12:18,740 --> 01:12:19,840
Don't leave him on top of us.

1672
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:23,920
Kendo, shut up, Kendo, why are you so angry?

1673
01:12:24,660 --> 01:12:26,300
Listen to me, listen to me.

1674
01:12:26,540 --> 01:12:27,980
No, it's black, it's black now.

1675
01:12:33,700 --> 01:12:34,500
I'm so...

1676
01:12:34,940 --> 01:12:35,720
I'm so sorry.

1677
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:38,860
Lying, lying, lying.

1678
01:12:39,100 --> 01:12:41,480
Green, green, green, green, green, green.

1679
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:43,080
Green is life, green is life.

1680
01:12:44,040 --> 01:12:45,620
Green and they're suffering.

1681
01:12:46,460 --> 01:12:47,580
Green, green, what's your problem?

1682
01:12:47,660 --> 01:12:48,420
Green, what's your problem?

1683
01:12:48,420 --> 01:12:49,860
Oh god, I swear.

1684
01:12:49,860 --> 01:12:50,440
What does green do?

1685
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:51,580
What's green's power?

1686
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:54,120
You're pro-law, you're suffering.

1687
01:12:54,820 --> 01:12:56,220
Green power, green power.

1688
01:12:56,720 --> 01:12:59,100
Yeah, this doll has a different melody.

1689
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:01,020
Are you having fun?

1690
01:13:01,740 --> 01:13:04,720
These dolls are faster, these dolls are faster, these dolls are faster.

1691
01:13:05,420 --> 01:13:06,300
I don't know.

1692
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:07,540
I don't know.

1693
01:13:08,220 --> 01:13:08,820
Yay.

1694
01:13:15,300 --> 01:13:15,900
Yay.

1695
01:13:19,440 --> 01:13:20,420
Was that good?

1696
01:13:20,500 --> 01:13:20,940
Was that good?

1697
01:13:21,300 --> 01:13:24,560
I don't know what that even means for us.

1698
01:13:24,780 --> 01:13:25,380
Red, we're safe!

1699
01:13:26,540 --> 01:13:27,320
What's the matter?

1700
01:13:28,460 --> 01:13:29,300
There's no point.

1701
01:13:29,540 --> 01:13:31,360
Red, red, red, red, red.

1702
01:13:31,640 --> 01:13:32,600
It's a scam.

1703
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:35,560
We're not actually safe.

1704
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:39,420
It's a scam.

1705
01:13:39,420 --> 01:13:39,580
It's a scam.

1706
01:13:39,580 --> 01:13:41,400
Blood will be shed on this red pick.

1707
01:13:42,860 --> 01:13:43,660
What's the point?

1708
01:13:43,720 --> 01:13:44,600
We have to kill it.

1709
01:13:44,700 --> 01:13:46,680
Ten people have to die anyways, right?

1710
01:13:46,840 --> 01:13:47,360
It's just a game.

1711
01:13:47,360 --> 01:13:47,800
It's just a game.

1712
01:13:48,420 --> 01:13:48,760
Oh, no!

1713
01:13:50,200 --> 01:13:51,840
The delusion of choice!

1714
01:13:52,500 --> 01:13:54,780
We're just making this round longer!

1715
01:13:56,940 --> 01:13:58,160
Stay with the green.

1716
01:13:58,200 --> 01:13:58,880
Yeah, regenerate.

1717
01:14:00,940 --> 01:14:01,820
Oh, please!

1718
01:14:04,060 --> 01:14:06,740
We already had three dolls left.

1719
01:14:10,280 --> 01:14:11,000
Six more.

1720
01:14:11,080 --> 01:14:13,180
Okay, we obviously know what a good doll looks like.

1721
01:14:13,260 --> 01:14:14,160
Light blue, light blue, light blue.

1722
01:14:14,160 --> 01:14:15,240
Aqua, Aqua, light blue.

1723
01:14:15,640 --> 01:14:17,260
Light blue, light blue, light blue.

1724
01:14:17,340 --> 01:14:17,620
Light blue, light blue, light blue.

1725
01:14:18,720 --> 01:14:20,760
This is bad, this is bad, this is bad, this is bad.

1726
01:14:20,760 --> 01:14:22,160
Oh, this man is gonna chase us.

1727
01:14:22,480 --> 01:14:28,760
The longer I'm in your support, the sadder he tries.

1728
01:14:32,440 --> 01:14:36,580
Oh, this is supposed to be the less stressful one, too!

1729
01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:39,060
Oh, yeah, yeah, the colors are going for it.

1730
01:14:39,160 --> 01:14:39,660
Oh, yeah.

1731
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:43,200
This is supposed to be the less stressful one.

1732
01:14:44,060 --> 01:14:45,380
Safe goals are completely pointless.

1733
01:14:46,140 --> 01:14:47,780
Yeah, I'm scared, I'm scared.

1734
01:14:49,440 --> 01:14:50,480
What's the point of the...

1735
01:14:50,480 --> 01:14:51,160
What's the point of the...

1736
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:53,120
Yeah, what's the point of the safe one?

1737
01:14:53,180 --> 01:14:54,140
Good question!

1738
01:14:54,420 --> 01:14:56,900
What is the point of the safe doll?!

1739
01:14:58,160 --> 01:14:59,480
Very good question!

1740
01:14:59,820 --> 01:15:00,640
Nobody knows.

1741
01:15:06,280 --> 01:15:09,140
Nobody knows what's the point of the safe doll.

1742
01:15:09,460 --> 01:15:10,780
Nobody knows.

1743
01:15:11,020 --> 01:15:11,740
Yeah, same as always.

1744
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:13,440
I don't know.

1745
01:15:13,560 --> 01:15:14,960
Stay in the intersection.

1746
01:15:15,360 --> 01:15:15,380
Did you see the lights?

1747
01:15:17,360 --> 01:15:18,520
Oh yeah, go, yeah, go, yeah.

1748
01:15:18,520 --> 01:15:19,240
Oh, they didn't shoot you?

1749
01:15:20,140 --> 01:15:22,400
Stay here, stay here.

1750
01:15:23,260 --> 01:15:24,220
Guard this.

1751
01:15:24,660 --> 01:15:26,080
We've been chilling here.

1752
01:15:26,240 --> 01:15:26,760
We've been chilling.

1753
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,220
We've been chilling, we've been chilling.

1754
01:15:35,020 --> 01:15:44,260
I like how the Strat is just following the Spanish players.

1755
01:15:44,740 --> 01:15:46,180
They know what they're doing.

1756
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,320
They know exactly what they're doing.

1757
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:52,000
Oh my god.

1758
01:15:52,240 --> 01:15:54,260
$70,000 for Latin America?

1759
01:15:54,540 --> 01:15:56,800
That's a lot of money converted for them.

1760
01:15:56,980 --> 01:15:57,540
How many are there?

1761
01:15:57,860 --> 01:16:00,720
That's when you know they really want to win, guys.

1762
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:01,500
Not gonna lie.

1763
01:16:01,800 --> 01:16:03,680
If Latin America...

1764
01:16:05,020 --> 01:16:05,980
$70,000?

1765
01:16:06,260 --> 01:16:08,240
It's like you're sick.

1766
01:16:10,580 --> 01:16:12,000
There's definitely two of these ones.

1767
01:16:12,260 --> 01:16:13,420
These guys are running here.

1768
01:16:13,460 --> 01:16:13,980
They're running right there.

1769
01:16:14,160 --> 01:16:15,020
They're running?

1770
01:16:15,200 --> 01:16:15,560
They're running.

1771
01:16:16,180 --> 01:16:16,500
Are you laughing?

1772
01:16:16,500 --> 01:16:16,800
Can you talk to my left side?

1773
01:16:16,900 --> 01:16:17,860
No no no no.

1774
01:16:17,860 --> 01:16:19,760
It's just 100ب toward me.

1775
01:16:22,600 --> 01:16:23,680
Wow wow!

1776
01:16:25,740 --> 01:16:27,060
For me, too.

1777
01:16:27,100 --> 01:16:27,820
Cause there's a hundred K F tip in here.

1778
01:16:27,820 --> 01:16:29,200
Damn this is too many Chromecube messages.

1779
01:16:31,300 --> 01:16:32,420
They're running for heaven.

1780
01:16:32,940 --> 01:16:34,540
Hey you're reacts a lot...

1781
01:17:15,980 --> 01:17:16,140
I'm literally shooting fireballs at people.

1782
01:17:49,520 --> 01:17:50,220
I

1783
01:17:53,410 --> 01:17:54,090
was 1HP!

1784
01:17:54,110 --> 01:17:55,650
I was 1HP!

1785
01:17:55,730 --> 01:17:57,290
I was 1HP!

1786
01:17:57,290 --> 01:17:57,290
I was 1HP!

1787
01:17:58,450 --> 01:18:00,530
I was 1HP!

1788
01:18:00,630 --> 01:18:02,210
I would've been out!

1789
01:18:05,110 --> 01:18:09,950
Are you like this so you see it from all the noise?

1790
01:18:13,350 --> 01:18:14,910
Goomy is so done.

1791
01:18:15,650 --> 01:18:17,530
Goomy is so done.

1792
01:18:20,770 --> 01:18:22,110
Honestly, say it.

1793
01:18:26,490 --> 01:18:27,530
It's magenta!

1794
01:18:30,270 --> 01:18:31,130
I was doing it!

1795
01:18:39,890 --> 01:18:40,930
Five more.

1796
01:18:41,390 --> 01:18:42,410
Five more!

1797
01:18:48,290 --> 01:18:49,870
I'll be okay if I get eliminated here.

1798
01:18:49,970 --> 01:18:50,570
I actually can.

1799
01:18:50,930 --> 01:18:51,290
I can.

1800
01:18:51,470 --> 01:18:52,190
I'm so tired.

1801
01:18:52,710 --> 01:18:54,670
I'm so goddamn tired.

1802
01:18:55,890 --> 01:18:56,750
I'm so tired.

1803
01:18:57,490 --> 01:18:58,990
I'm so tired.

1804
01:18:59,390 --> 01:19:00,630
Oh my god, these are fast.

1805
01:19:00,790 --> 01:19:01,230
These are fast.

1806
01:19:02,410 --> 01:19:03,470
I'm so tired.

1807
01:19:03,750 --> 01:19:04,370
Anyone follow?

1808
01:19:04,490 --> 01:19:05,130
Anyone follow us?

1809
01:19:05,270 --> 01:19:06,710
Yeah, 1, 1, 1, 1.

1810
01:19:06,730 --> 01:19:08,450
Yes, yes, 1, 1, yes, yes, 1, 1, 1.

1811
01:19:11,550 --> 01:19:12,270
It's not.

1812
01:19:12,410 --> 01:19:12,670
It's not.

1813
01:19:12,690 --> 01:19:13,070
It's not.

1814
01:19:16,270 --> 01:19:17,610
That was fast!

1815
01:19:18,850 --> 01:19:20,050
That was so fast!

1816
01:19:20,050 --> 01:19:20,770
That was so fast!

1817
01:19:20,870 --> 01:19:21,690
Oh my god.

1818
01:19:21,690 --> 01:19:22,910
They're a lot faster now.

1819
01:19:23,170 --> 01:19:23,910
Oh my god.

1820
01:19:23,910 --> 01:19:25,110
They're a lot faster.

1821
01:19:25,110 --> 01:19:25,390
They're a lot faster.

1822
01:19:25,530 --> 01:19:27,670
Well, now only the superior red man is left.

1823
01:19:28,150 --> 01:19:29,390
We're in the competition.

1824
01:19:29,470 --> 01:19:30,070
It's really fast.

1825
01:19:30,270 --> 01:19:31,110
It's really fast.

1826
01:19:31,190 --> 01:19:32,930
Frankie, if you get locked on, you're dead.

1827
01:19:33,030 --> 01:19:33,590
You're dead.

1828
01:19:34,290 --> 01:19:35,410
Guys, guys.

1829
01:19:35,430 --> 01:19:38,570
If he's gonna hit you, just hit the spots.

1830
01:19:38,830 --> 01:19:39,390
The hidden spots.

1831
01:19:39,490 --> 01:19:40,670
If he's gonna hit you, just thug it out.

1832
01:19:40,710 --> 01:19:41,250
Just ignore him.

1833
01:19:41,970 --> 01:19:42,590
Thug it out.

1834
01:19:42,690 --> 01:19:43,870
Hit the thug shake.

1835
01:19:43,930 --> 01:19:44,370
Thug shake.

1836
01:19:44,570 --> 01:19:44,890
Ignore him.

1837
01:19:44,890 --> 01:19:45,950
Just right click this.

1838
01:19:46,330 --> 01:19:46,770
Yeah.

1839
01:19:47,070 --> 01:19:48,210
My spot keeps being like this.

1840
01:19:48,210 --> 01:19:48,590
I'm gonna take you.

1841
01:19:48,590 --> 01:19:49,150
Orange.

1842
01:19:49,210 --> 01:19:49,930
Orange.

1843
01:19:50,550 --> 01:19:51,270
Orange.

1844
01:19:53,930 --> 01:19:54,650
Orange.

1845
01:19:55,110 --> 01:19:55,830
Orange.

1846
01:19:56,390 --> 01:19:56,830
Orange.

1847
01:19:56,830 --> 01:19:57,130
Orange.

1848
01:19:58,030 --> 01:19:58,750
Orange.

1849
01:19:58,970 --> 01:19:59,230
Orange.

1850
01:19:59,230 --> 01:19:59,270
Orange.

1851
01:19:59,430 --> 01:19:59,810
Orange.

1852
01:19:59,970 --> 01:19:59,990
Orange.

1853
01:19:59,990 --> 01:20:00,130
Orange.

1854
01:20:00,130 --> 01:20:00,490
Orange.

1855
01:20:00,490 --> 01:20:00,550
Orange.

1856
01:20:00,590 --> 01:20:00,670
Orange.

1857
01:20:04,350 --> 01:20:05,070
Orange.

1858
01:20:09,770 --> 01:20:10,490
Orange.

1859
01:20:24,460 --> 01:20:27,180
This is the social experiment.

1860
01:20:27,400 --> 01:20:29,760
This is the Stanford Prison Experiment.

1861
01:20:29,800 --> 01:20:32,980
I refuse to believe this is a tournament anymore.

1862
01:20:35,280 --> 01:20:38,160
This is a psychology experiment.

1863
01:20:39,320 --> 01:20:43,620
A declining mental capacity of a typical streamer.

1864
01:20:44,420 --> 01:20:46,320
I refuse to believe.

1865
01:20:47,040 --> 01:20:48,280
I think he's fireball boy.

1866
01:20:48,980 --> 01:20:49,900
He's coming for us!

1867
01:20:50,360 --> 01:20:52,040
He's coming for us.

1868
01:20:52,040 --> 01:20:53,500
He's coming for us.

1869
01:20:53,980 --> 01:20:55,900
But they're all faster than me.

1870
01:20:56,360 --> 01:20:57,180
He's coming.

1871
01:20:58,100 --> 01:20:59,140
I'm so scared.

1872
01:21:00,520 --> 01:21:01,560
I'm so scared.

1873
01:21:02,040 --> 01:21:02,880
He's coming.

1874
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,980
You guys are all good Minecraft players.

1875
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:06,260
Oh my god.

1876
01:21:06,300 --> 01:21:06,460
What?

1877
01:21:09,640 --> 01:21:10,900
He's so loud.

1878
01:21:12,660 --> 01:21:13,640
He's so loud.

1879
01:21:13,640 --> 01:21:14,600
He's so loud.

1880
01:21:14,760 --> 01:21:16,860
They're all better players than me.

1881
01:21:17,820 --> 01:21:19,000
No, Axxo, no!

1882
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,160
They're all better players than me.

1883
01:21:22,160 --> 01:21:23,400
They're faster than me.

1884
01:21:23,960 --> 01:21:24,840
Axxo, run!

1885
01:21:25,180 --> 01:21:26,880
No, Axxo!

1886
01:21:27,360 --> 01:21:28,320
No, Axxo!

1887
01:21:28,380 --> 01:21:31,040
They're all faster than me.

1888
01:21:31,500 --> 01:21:34,600
They're all faster than me.

1889
01:21:34,880 --> 01:21:35,620
Help!

1890
01:21:36,860 --> 01:21:37,300
Help!

1891
01:21:38,460 --> 01:21:39,200
He's like a lion.

1892
01:21:39,660 --> 01:21:40,580
I don't hear it.

1893
01:21:41,700 --> 01:21:43,640
He's still there.

1894
01:21:43,700 --> 01:21:44,000
He's still there.

1895
01:21:46,600 --> 01:21:47,860
No, I messed up the stairs.

1896
01:21:47,980 --> 01:21:49,000
I messed up the stairs, guys.

1897
01:21:49,100 --> 01:21:50,020
I messed up the stairs.

1898
01:21:51,400 --> 01:21:52,120
He's right there.

1899
01:21:52,840 --> 01:21:54,740
He's right there.

1900
01:21:55,140 --> 01:21:55,860
Bro, there's nothing.

1901
01:21:58,060 --> 01:21:58,520
Axxo, no!

1902
01:21:59,740 --> 01:22:00,300
Axxo, no!

1903
01:22:02,520 --> 01:22:03,460
Axxo is right there!

1904
01:22:04,720 --> 01:22:05,340
Oh, he's behind.

1905
01:22:05,480 --> 01:22:05,820
He's still behind.

1906
01:22:06,120 --> 01:22:07,160
He's still behind.

1907
01:22:09,080 --> 01:22:10,140
He's still right behind.

1908
01:22:10,320 --> 01:22:11,340
I hear something.

1909
01:22:11,600 --> 01:22:12,300
I hear something.

1910
01:22:12,620 --> 01:22:13,100
I don't like him.

1911
01:22:13,320 --> 01:22:14,440
Okay, okay, okay.

1912
01:22:14,480 --> 01:22:18,340
You lived in my dreams.

1913
01:22:18,360 --> 01:22:18,880
Stay.

1914
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:21,460
Relocate my fantasy.

1915
01:22:22,740 --> 01:22:24,440
I stay reality.

1916
01:22:25,960 --> 01:22:27,640
You made my dreams.

1917
01:22:27,900 --> 01:22:28,400
Stay.

1918
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:33,960
She was a broken, kind, Oh my god...

1919
01:22:33,960 --> 01:22:34,480
What the fuck?

1920
01:22:35,300 --> 01:22:37,460
Run, run, run, run, run!

1921
01:22:38,460 --> 01:22:40,380
It's on us, it's on us, it's on us, it's on us!

1922
01:22:40,780 --> 01:22:41,580
It's right there!

1923
01:22:41,740 --> 01:22:42,760
IT'S RIGHT THERE!

1924
01:22:42,900 --> 01:22:44,220
It's right there, it's right there!

1925
01:22:44,500 --> 01:22:46,580
I'm so scared, I'm so scared, I'm so scared...

1926
01:22:46,580 --> 01:22:47,240
Ow!

1927
01:22:49,600 --> 01:22:50,480
Five up!

1928
01:22:51,360 --> 01:22:52,180
Five up!

1929
01:22:54,900 --> 01:22:55,340
Help!

1930
01:22:57,080 --> 01:22:57,520
Please!

1931
01:22:57,520 --> 01:22:58,140
Oh, please!

1932
01:22:58,260 --> 01:22:59,460
Let's kill somebody!

1933
01:23:01,340 --> 01:23:02,700
That's mental torture!

1934
01:23:05,060 --> 01:23:06,840
That's mental torture!

1935
01:23:08,300 --> 01:23:10,440
Oh my god!

1936
01:23:10,840 --> 01:23:12,820
That's mental torture!

1937
01:23:15,580 --> 01:23:17,800
Just give us money for this!

1938
01:23:17,840 --> 01:23:18,620
I don't care!

1939
01:23:18,700 --> 01:23:21,080
We deserve money for doing this!

1940
01:23:21,320 --> 01:23:23,540
The sick entertainment for viewers!

1941
01:23:27,520 --> 01:23:29,400
It keeps doing that!

1942
01:23:29,900 --> 01:23:34,340
We deserve money for this!

1943
01:23:39,560 --> 01:23:41,560
Oh my god!

1944
01:23:42,440 --> 01:23:44,660
I can't be confident!

1945
01:23:52,400 --> 01:23:54,740
This is so sad!

1946
01:23:55,100 --> 01:23:56,620
We deserve to be rewarded!

1947
01:23:57,520 --> 01:23:58,500
I don't care if we get punished for this!

1948
01:23:58,540 --> 01:23:59,320
I don't care!

1949
01:23:59,560 --> 01:24:00,760
Not you guys!

1950
01:24:01,080 --> 01:24:02,220
Not you guys!

1951
01:24:02,220 --> 01:24:04,200
The sick entertainment for viewers!

1952
01:24:06,180 --> 01:24:16,360
You deserve kind of that $30,000!

1953
01:24:18,480 --> 01:24:21,660
Oh, ha, ha, ha, ha...

1954
01:24:40,400 --> 01:24:45,100
We can't mute guys, we have to listen to no one, we have to run.

1955
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:46,960
That's the worst part.

1956
01:24:47,920 --> 01:24:49,340
We have to run.

1957
01:24:50,100 --> 01:24:51,820
It's either light blue or brown.

1958
01:24:52,700 --> 01:24:55,480
Yeah they are, they're basically the Pixar seagulls.

1959
01:25:00,560 --> 01:25:02,460
I'll try and turn it down again.

1960
01:25:04,140 --> 01:25:06,720
Dude this game is lasting way too much.

1961
01:25:07,020 --> 01:25:09,080
I did not expect us to lose this long.

1962
01:25:10,340 --> 01:25:12,160
How many people need to die?

1963
01:25:13,080 --> 01:25:13,520
Three?

1964
01:25:15,120 --> 01:25:15,920
Three more.

1965
01:25:16,220 --> 01:25:18,380
I feel like the remainder of people are going to die.

1966
01:25:20,500 --> 01:25:21,700
Goodbye, this is it.

1967
01:25:21,760 --> 01:25:22,480
I can feel it.

1968
01:25:22,540 --> 01:25:24,240
This has to be it, this has to be it.

1969
01:25:24,300 --> 01:25:24,560
Please.

1970
01:25:25,480 --> 01:25:26,700
Please just kill me.

1971
01:25:27,340 --> 01:25:28,260
Just take me out.

1972
01:25:29,060 --> 01:25:29,420
Please.

1973
01:25:29,660 --> 01:25:31,840
Just like instantly run at me.

1974
01:25:31,920 --> 01:25:32,460
I don't care.

1975
01:25:32,720 --> 01:25:33,080
Run!

1976
01:25:33,220 --> 01:25:35,020
Just instantly run at me.

1977
01:25:35,380 --> 01:25:36,000
And stab me in the heart.

1978
01:25:36,020 --> 01:25:36,420
Is it coming?

1979
01:25:36,540 --> 01:25:36,820
Is it coming?

1980
01:25:36,940 --> 01:25:38,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1981
01:25:39,300 --> 01:25:40,080
Stab me in the heart.

1982
01:25:40,080 --> 01:25:40,340
It's coming.

1983
01:25:41,120 --> 01:25:42,420
Don't stop, don't stop, don't stop.

1984
01:25:42,720 --> 01:25:43,460
Don't stop.

1985
01:25:44,680 --> 01:25:45,400
Believe in me.

1986
01:25:45,620 --> 01:25:46,760
Instantly stab me please.

1987
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:47,920
Hold on to my feelings.

1988
01:25:47,960 --> 01:25:48,520
Oh my god.

1989
01:25:49,920 --> 01:25:52,180
You were so close.

1990
01:25:52,180 --> 01:25:52,820
You walked through.

1991
01:25:53,760 --> 01:25:54,380
You walked through.

1992
01:25:54,380 --> 01:25:55,400
It was literally right here.

1993
01:25:58,660 --> 01:26:00,020
Was it right here?

1994
01:26:00,380 --> 01:26:00,660
I don't believe it.

1995
01:26:00,900 --> 01:26:01,380
I think so.

1996
01:26:01,620 --> 01:26:03,100
No, this one is really close.

1997
01:26:03,100 --> 01:26:03,720
Oh my god.

1998
01:26:03,740 --> 01:26:04,440
This one is...

1999
01:26:04,440 --> 01:26:06,000
Oh my god.

2000
01:26:06,680 --> 01:26:07,960
We should stop this one.

2001
01:26:08,960 --> 01:26:11,300
We should just stop thinking of this one.

2002
01:26:11,440 --> 01:26:13,140
I think we have to go through every single one of them now.

2003
01:26:13,200 --> 01:26:13,720
That's the last one.

2004
01:26:13,720 --> 01:26:14,520
The other guy, Axel.

2005
01:26:14,620 --> 01:26:15,980
He's my friend, my friend.

2006
01:26:16,100 --> 01:26:16,120
Yes, yes.

2007
01:26:16,600 --> 01:26:17,940
I met him.

2008
01:26:18,300 --> 01:26:19,280
No, there's no...

2009
01:26:19,280 --> 01:26:19,660
He's dying.

2010
01:26:20,560 --> 01:26:22,580
Siren, siren, siren, siren, siren.

2011
01:26:22,580 --> 01:26:24,360
Siren, siren, siren, siren.

2012
01:26:24,360 --> 01:26:28,540
Siren, siren, siren, siren, siren.

2013
01:26:30,360 --> 01:26:31,800
Siren, siren, siren, siren, siren.

2014
01:26:31,800 --> 01:26:33,880
Siren, siren, siren, siren, siren.

2015
01:26:35,940 --> 01:26:37,940
Siren, siren, siren, siren, siren.

2016
01:26:37,940 --> 01:26:38,940
Siren, siren, siren, siren, siren.

2017
01:26:38,940 --> 01:26:39,320
Siren, siren, siren, siren, siren.

2018
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:41,360
Siren, siren, siren, siren, siren.

2019
01:26:41,360 --> 01:26:42,860
Siren, siren, siren, siren, siren.

2020
01:26:43,020 --> 01:26:44,400
Siren, siren, siren, siren, siren.

2021
01:26:46,360 --> 01:26:48,120
Siren, siren, siren, siren, siren.

2022
01:26:49,340 --> 01:26:51,440
Siren, siren, siren, siren, siren.

2023
01:26:53,680 --> 01:26:54,340
Siren, siren, siren, siren, siren.

2024
01:26:54,340 --> 01:26:55,260
Alright, this is where I die.

2025
01:26:55,560 --> 01:26:57,920
Just run at me.

2026
01:26:58,220 --> 01:26:59,500
Stab me, that's all I want.

2027
01:27:00,100 --> 01:27:00,920
Just stab me.

2028
01:27:01,320 --> 01:27:02,440
Put me out of my misery.

2029
01:27:02,680 --> 01:27:04,260
Just stab me.

2030
01:27:04,780 --> 01:27:05,720
I'm being hunted.

2031
01:27:05,840 --> 01:27:06,520
Is it coming?

2032
01:27:06,840 --> 01:27:06,880
Is it coming?

2033
01:27:07,380 --> 01:27:08,460
Yes or no?

2034
01:27:08,660 --> 01:27:09,000
Is it?

2035
01:27:09,160 --> 01:27:09,480
Question mark?

2036
01:27:09,480 --> 01:27:10,920
I don't think any of them followed.

2037
01:27:11,420 --> 01:27:12,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2038
01:27:12,280 --> 01:27:12,980
One followed once.

2039
01:27:13,200 --> 01:27:15,900
Oh my god, I thought it was gonna be hunting me.

2040
01:27:16,060 --> 01:27:17,940
I thought it was it.

2041
01:27:18,180 --> 01:27:18,840
I don't know.

2042
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:19,380
I don't think so.

2043
01:27:19,380 --> 01:27:20,120
We shouldn't run.

2044
01:27:20,240 --> 01:27:20,540
We shouldn't run.

2045
01:27:20,660 --> 01:27:21,220
We should stay in the corner.

2046
01:27:21,280 --> 01:27:21,720
Is it behind us?

2047
01:27:21,940 --> 01:27:22,320
Is it behind us?

2048
01:27:22,440 --> 01:27:23,760
I don't know, but it's somewhere.

2049
01:27:23,760 --> 01:27:24,860
It's not behind us.

2050
01:27:24,880 --> 01:27:26,100
It's not here.

2051
01:27:26,240 --> 01:27:28,300
Why would we move from a place that's...

2052
01:27:28,780 --> 01:27:29,700
Let's hold the corner.

2053
01:27:29,700 --> 01:27:30,300
Hit me, hit me, hit me.

2054
01:27:30,500 --> 01:27:31,100
Come, come, come.

2055
01:27:31,500 --> 01:27:32,240
We can hold the corner.

2056
01:27:32,240 --> 01:27:32,580
It's fine.

2057
01:27:35,540 --> 01:27:37,680
Oh man, I don't trust that spot, guys.

2058
01:27:38,100 --> 01:27:38,980
Watch that side.

2059
01:27:39,040 --> 01:27:40,040
I'm gonna watch the side.

2060
01:27:40,200 --> 01:27:41,080
I mean, I got it.

2061
01:27:41,080 --> 01:27:42,680
It's hunting you from over here, so...

2062
01:27:43,300 --> 01:27:44,320
This is so sad.

2063
01:27:46,460 --> 01:27:47,660
I got one earlier.

2064
01:27:47,880 --> 01:27:48,760
That's why I wanted to go...

2065
01:27:48,760 --> 01:27:49,740
Groups are shrinking, man.

2066
01:27:49,740 --> 01:27:50,020
This is scary.

2067
01:27:50,020 --> 01:27:50,760
Oh, there's a group coming over here?

2068
01:27:51,520 --> 01:27:52,000
Question mark?

2069
01:27:53,760 --> 01:27:54,060
Let's get, let's get.

2070
01:27:54,100 --> 01:27:54,840
Running from the other end.

2071
01:27:54,920 --> 01:27:56,200
Oh yeah, it's right here, it's right here.

2072
01:27:56,280 --> 01:27:57,400
It's right in front of me, it's right in front of me.

2073
01:27:57,680 --> 01:27:58,460
It's chilling, it's chilling.

2074
01:27:58,560 --> 01:27:59,100
Just circling around.

2075
01:27:59,960 --> 01:28:02,400
Go, go, go, go, go.

2076
01:28:02,780 --> 01:28:03,660
Don't scream, don't scream.

2077
01:28:04,160 --> 01:28:05,440
Wait, there's one here as well.

2078
01:28:05,460 --> 01:28:06,160
There's one here as well.

2079
01:28:06,980 --> 01:28:07,540
Don't scream.

2080
01:28:08,560 --> 01:28:09,360
Okay, let's go that way.

2081
01:28:09,360 --> 01:28:10,100
They turned around, they turned around.

2082
01:28:11,320 --> 01:28:12,680
Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh.

2083
01:28:13,100 --> 01:28:14,140
Stay near the other crab.

2084
01:28:14,240 --> 01:28:15,220
Stay near the other crab.

2085
01:28:15,300 --> 01:28:16,080
Stay near the other crab.

2086
01:28:16,120 --> 01:28:18,360
Remember guys, just don't die and everything will be fine.

2087
01:28:20,360 --> 01:28:21,280
Wolfie, just stay back here.

2088
01:28:21,360 --> 01:28:21,500
You're good.

2089
01:28:21,900 --> 01:28:23,260
Oh, he is behind us.

2090
01:28:23,260 --> 01:28:23,440
Wow.

2091
01:28:23,440 --> 01:28:24,840
He hit my butt.

2092
01:28:25,560 --> 01:28:26,700
He's right behind me, isn't he?

2093
01:28:26,820 --> 01:28:27,280
Okay, okay, okay.

2094
01:28:27,380 --> 01:28:28,540
He is right behind me.

2095
01:28:28,760 --> 01:28:30,460
Oh no, this is it, this is it, guys.

2096
01:28:30,460 --> 01:28:31,900
This is it, I'm the slowest.

2097
01:28:32,360 --> 01:28:34,600
I don't know the tech, I don't know the tech.

2098
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:36,420
Goodbye.

2099
01:28:37,520 --> 01:28:37,940
Goodbye.

2100
01:28:39,540 --> 01:28:40,440
Goodbye, guys.

2101
01:28:40,760 --> 01:28:42,260
I don't know the running tech.

2102
01:28:43,260 --> 01:28:44,560
It is right behind us.

2103
01:28:44,600 --> 01:28:45,300
I don't know.

2104
01:28:46,780 --> 01:28:48,800
I don't know the running tech.

2105
01:28:48,880 --> 01:28:49,700
This is it.

2106
01:28:51,860 --> 01:28:53,320
Oh, got me.

2107
01:28:53,440 --> 01:28:53,700
Go, T élect envolves you.

2108
01:28:53,700 --> 01:28:53,720
Wow.

2109
01:28:53,720 --> 01:28:53,840
Where was she?

2110
01:28:54,140 --> 01:28:54,480
You got her.

2111
01:28:54,480 --> 01:28:55,960
Gummy, Gummy, run.

2112
01:28:56,380 --> 01:28:58,080
We had a good run.

2113
01:28:58,860 --> 01:29:02,120
We had such a good run, everybody !

2114
01:29:03,160 --> 01:29:06,180
We had such a good run, everyone!

2115
01:29:08,420 --> 01:29:12,840
We had an insane run, everybody, but this is it.

2116
01:29:14,660 --> 01:29:15,960
This is it.

2117
01:29:16,280 --> 01:29:17,360
It was worth a shot.

2118
01:29:17,500 --> 01:29:17,960
It was worth a shot.

2119
01:29:17,960 --> 01:29:18,740
Yeah, I think so.

2120
01:29:18,960 --> 01:29:19,820
What the mid-wing?

2121
01:29:19,900 --> 01:29:20,500
Is it still behind us?

2122
01:29:20,500 --> 01:29:21,060
You got me there.

2123
01:29:21,220 --> 01:29:21,740
No, no, no.

2124
01:29:21,920 --> 01:29:22,240
Yeah.

2125
01:29:22,920 --> 01:29:23,960
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

2126
01:29:24,160 --> 01:29:25,940
Yeah, I never managed to get there.

2127
01:29:26,180 --> 01:29:26,960
Throw in fireballs.

2128
01:29:27,640 --> 01:29:27,940
Throw in fireballs.

2129
01:29:28,660 --> 01:29:29,540
Oh my god.

2130
01:29:29,680 --> 01:29:30,020
Right, right, right.

2131
01:29:30,300 --> 01:29:30,800
Yeah, right.

2132
01:29:31,140 --> 01:29:31,680
Uh-oh.

2133
01:29:32,640 --> 01:29:36,040
I just want somebody to turn around and just take it.

2134
01:29:37,540 --> 01:29:38,600
This is a good lap.

2135
01:29:38,680 --> 01:29:39,320
This is a good loop.

2136
01:29:39,340 --> 01:29:39,780
We can run.

2137
01:29:39,960 --> 01:29:40,700
Yeah, oh my god.

2138
01:29:40,720 --> 01:29:42,360
This is not even like hide anymore.

2139
01:29:42,520 --> 01:29:43,740
It's just run.

2140
01:29:45,140 --> 01:29:45,860
No, I'm safe.

2141
01:29:45,880 --> 01:29:46,200
I'm safe.

2142
01:29:46,300 --> 01:29:47,000
It's just...

2143
01:29:47,580 --> 01:29:47,940
No, I'm safe.

2144
01:29:47,940 --> 01:29:50,160
It's not even hide and seek.

2145
01:29:50,700 --> 01:29:51,640
We're just...

2146
01:29:51,640 --> 01:29:53,600
It's like a marathon run.

2147
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:57,260
We're just doing a marathon right now.

2148
01:29:58,520 --> 01:29:59,180
Oh my god.

2149
01:29:59,520 --> 01:30:00,080
Oh my god.

2150
01:30:00,180 --> 01:30:02,300
Turn, turn, turn, turn, turn.

2151
01:30:02,440 --> 01:30:03,780
Turn around, turn around, turn around.

2152
01:30:03,900 --> 01:30:04,820
Oh my god.

2153
01:30:05,700 --> 01:30:07,140
I think I'm done.

2154
01:30:07,160 --> 01:30:07,720
Marathon!

2155
01:30:08,280 --> 01:30:09,420
Turn around, turn around.

2156
01:30:09,680 --> 01:30:10,420
I'm scared.

2157
01:30:10,780 --> 01:30:13,280
Every now and then I fall apart.

2158
01:30:13,920 --> 01:30:16,820
And I'm gonna be a liar.

2159
01:30:17,220 --> 01:30:17,900
I'm scared.

2160
01:30:23,520 --> 01:30:24,740
This is not good.

2161
01:30:24,900 --> 01:30:26,520
We got to converge with those guys.

2162
01:30:26,680 --> 01:30:27,360
We screwed up.

2163
01:30:27,720 --> 01:30:28,380
Oh, come on.

2164
01:30:28,420 --> 01:30:29,020
We did not screw up.

2165
01:30:29,140 --> 01:30:29,880
Oh, here it is.

2166
01:30:30,160 --> 01:30:31,060
This sacrifice.

2167
01:30:32,080 --> 01:30:33,620
Goodbye, funny guy, if you want to.

2168
01:30:34,320 --> 01:30:37,560
This is it.

2169
01:30:38,460 --> 01:30:41,140
It would be so poetic that I got eliminated last person.

2170
01:30:41,500 --> 01:30:44,080
As the last person I get eliminated right away.

2171
01:30:44,240 --> 01:30:45,660
It would be so poetic though.

2172
01:30:46,020 --> 01:30:46,920
Oh my god.

2173
01:30:46,920 --> 01:30:50,120
After going through like the entire round.

2174
01:30:50,260 --> 01:30:51,320
The stressful day.

2175
01:30:51,620 --> 01:30:54,180
I am the last person to be out.

2176
01:30:55,860 --> 01:30:58,660
It would be so poetic.

2177
01:31:00,020 --> 01:31:01,700
After everything we've been through.

2178
01:31:05,140 --> 01:31:08,540
It would be so poetic.

2179
01:31:11,700 --> 01:31:13,780
Guys, green is not going to happen.

2180
01:31:13,960 --> 01:31:14,960
Green is not going to happen.

2181
01:31:15,040 --> 01:31:16,180
I'm going to be honest.

2182
01:31:20,160 --> 01:31:20,800
I'm not going tolife completely.

2183
01:31:20,800 --> 01:31:22,780
No, why does it have to be saved?

2184
01:31:25,180 --> 01:31:25,720
Why?

2185
01:31:29,360 --> 01:31:33,180
Say it to the moon .

2186
01:31:34,080 --> 01:31:34,660
Why?

2187
01:31:34,660 --> 01:31:36,320
I don't care, it's just not there.

2188
01:31:36,600 --> 01:31:39,440
Just no matter what, it's just not there.

2189
01:31:42,740 --> 01:31:44,040
Yeah, she is still alive.

2190
01:31:44,620 --> 01:31:45,200
Whatever.

2191
01:31:45,880 --> 01:31:46,900
That's not good.

2192
01:31:46,900 --> 01:31:48,880
I just don't want to be here.

2193
01:31:49,880 --> 01:31:51,160
The round is going to be safe.

2194
01:31:51,380 --> 01:31:53,180
We have to be brave and get our clothes on.

2195
01:31:53,180 --> 01:31:54,900
We are not going to have to pick this one anyways.

2196
01:31:56,100 --> 01:31:58,180
Maybe it doesn't matter what we're picking.

2197
01:31:58,260 --> 01:32:00,100
We're going to pick the things we want.

2198
01:32:00,240 --> 01:32:00,640
Pfft.

2199
01:32:02,520 --> 01:32:02,920
Pfft.

2200
01:32:03,240 --> 01:32:04,140
This is the line.

2201
01:32:04,640 --> 01:32:05,680
Oh my god.

2202
01:32:06,840 --> 01:32:08,200
Oh my god.

2203
01:32:09,580 --> 01:32:10,280
Oh my god.

2204
01:32:10,860 --> 01:32:11,620
Oh my god.

2205
01:32:12,480 --> 01:32:13,100
Don't be safe.

2206
01:32:13,100 --> 01:32:13,540
Don't be safe.

2207
01:32:13,620 --> 01:32:14,000
Don't be safe.

2208
01:32:14,020 --> 01:32:14,420
Don't be safe.

2209
01:32:15,180 --> 01:32:17,160
Why does he keep screaming?

2210
01:32:17,380 --> 01:32:18,320
Who is this?

2211
01:32:18,320 --> 01:32:20,360
Call the streamer out right now to me.

2212
01:32:20,600 --> 01:32:21,900
Who is this?

2213
01:32:21,900 --> 01:32:26,620
And I will specifically meet that person in voice chat if I live.

2214
01:32:28,960 --> 01:32:29,720
Is it?

2215
01:32:29,800 --> 01:32:30,660
Oh my god.

2216
01:32:34,920 --> 01:32:36,460
Okay, I have power.

2217
01:32:37,840 --> 01:32:40,400
Okay, well there's just one dog left.

2218
01:32:43,100 --> 01:32:43,460
What's the point?

2219
01:32:43,460 --> 01:32:45,640
What's the point of safe dolls, bro?

2220
01:32:45,800 --> 01:32:47,300
Where is he?

2221
01:32:50,620 --> 01:32:52,460
Oh wait, I got the wrong one.

2222
01:32:52,560 --> 01:32:52,840
Whoops.

2223
01:32:53,240 --> 01:32:53,720
Sorry.

2224
01:32:54,880 --> 01:32:55,480
It's meaningless.

2225
01:32:55,820 --> 01:32:57,540
We're all meant to die anyway.

2226
01:32:59,840 --> 01:33:01,160
Red guys don't die.

2227
01:33:01,260 --> 01:33:02,260
Red guys don't die.

2228
01:33:02,320 --> 01:33:02,960
Red guys don't die.

2229
01:33:04,140 --> 01:33:05,140
Red guys don't die.

2230
01:33:05,360 --> 01:33:05,660
Red guys don't die.

2231
01:33:06,260 --> 01:33:06,740
Sorry.

2232
01:33:09,080 --> 01:33:10,000
Oh my god, bro.

2233
01:33:10,080 --> 01:33:11,640
Thank you for the tier one.

2234
01:33:11,640 --> 01:33:13,780
I'm going through hell right now.

2235
01:33:14,620 --> 01:33:15,600
This is it.

2236
01:33:15,980 --> 01:33:18,060
Goodbye, everybody.

2237
01:33:18,300 --> 01:33:19,620
It was a good run.

2238
01:33:20,220 --> 01:33:22,220
It was a good run, everyone.

2239
01:33:23,720 --> 01:33:24,780
I had a...

2240
01:33:25,560 --> 01:33:26,580
Run, run, run!

2241
01:33:26,920 --> 01:33:28,440
It was a good run.

2242
01:33:28,620 --> 01:33:31,560
I had a great time in here with everybody.

2243
01:33:32,740 --> 01:33:35,940
It was such a good run that like...

2244
01:33:36,480 --> 01:33:37,620
Guys, we win or not?

2245
01:33:37,680 --> 01:33:38,120
We win or not?

2246
01:33:38,120 --> 01:33:38,580
We win or not?

2247
01:33:38,580 --> 01:33:39,500
We had such a good run.

2248
01:33:39,500 --> 01:33:42,240
We had such a good run.

2249
01:33:42,240 --> 01:33:42,600
We had such a good run.

2250
01:33:42,820 --> 01:33:44,880
We had such a good run and this is it.

2251
01:33:44,940 --> 01:33:45,800
This is where we...

2252
01:33:46,680 --> 01:33:48,520
This is where we call it.

2253
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:53,260
Guys, if it says that it's targeting you, you have to jump inside one of those hiding places.

2254
01:33:53,400 --> 01:33:54,700
If you don't do it, it's gonna kill you.

2255
01:33:54,880 --> 01:33:55,640
Just so you know.

2256
01:33:55,860 --> 01:33:57,380
I was targeted last time.

2257
01:33:57,540 --> 01:33:59,000
I was targeted last time.

2258
01:33:59,000 --> 01:33:59,400
That's insane.

2259
01:33:59,760 --> 01:34:00,620
I was hunted in a crowd.

2260
01:34:02,020 --> 01:34:02,460
GG!

2261
01:34:04,740 --> 01:34:05,200
No way!

2262
01:34:05,520 --> 01:34:05,720
GG!

2263
01:34:05,960 --> 01:34:06,460
Who was?

2264
01:34:06,940 --> 01:34:07,700
Who died?

2265
01:34:10,320 --> 01:34:10,880
GG!

2266
01:34:11,960 --> 01:34:12,520
No...

2267
01:34:12,520 --> 01:34:13,140
GG!

2268
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:18,160
No...

2269
01:34:18,160 --> 01:34:18,760
No...

2270
01:34:18,760 --> 01:34:18,820
No...

2271
01:34:18,820 --> 01:34:19,040
No...

2272
01:34:19,040 --> 01:34:19,320
No...

2273
01:34:19,320 --> 01:34:20,160
No...

2274
01:34:20,160 --> 01:34:21,000
No...

2275
01:34:22,520 --> 01:34:25,580
Are we the last six in our room, guys?

2276
01:34:25,780 --> 01:34:26,660
Oh my god!

2277
01:34:26,960 --> 01:34:29,180
I think so.

2278
01:34:29,280 --> 01:34:30,960
I think we all have a set spawn room.

2279
01:34:31,220 --> 01:34:31,980
No, no, no.

2280
01:34:36,940 --> 01:34:39,220
This is the pain that never ends.

2281
01:34:43,770 --> 01:34:46,560
I think this one was the worst one.

2282
01:34:51,240 --> 01:34:52,480
30 people.

2283
01:34:52,640 --> 01:34:56,080
30 people are going to get eliminated in the next one.

2284
01:34:56,200 --> 01:34:58,620
It's the prop hunt game.

2285
01:35:00,660 --> 01:35:02,580
Wait, Iroh got eliminated?

2286
01:35:03,180 --> 01:35:04,040
Oh my god.

2287
01:35:04,380 --> 01:35:07,820
To be fair, I was surprised that he lived this long.

2288
01:35:10,980 --> 01:35:13,220
I was just as stressed.

2289
01:35:14,020 --> 01:35:15,140
Oh my god.

2290
01:35:15,320 --> 01:35:16,520
I need to be in a corner.

2291
01:35:17,120 --> 01:35:18,200
I need to... wait.

2292
01:35:18,400 --> 01:35:19,340
Okay, that's cool.

2293
01:35:23,480 --> 01:35:25,020
Give me a sec, guys.

2294
01:35:33,400 --> 01:35:34,720
Oh my god.

2295
01:35:34,820 --> 01:35:36,520
Let me turn down the...

2296
01:35:36,520 --> 01:35:38,440
Wait, voice chat would be...

2297
01:35:38,440 --> 01:35:39,940
Okay, give me a sec.

2298
01:35:40,140 --> 01:35:42,720
I actually need a tiny reset myself.

2299
01:35:47,820 --> 01:35:49,020
Thank god.

2300
01:35:49,540 --> 01:35:52,820
I feel like they should have play tested that game.

2301
01:35:55,560 --> 01:35:57,920
Devlin, thank you for the 100 biddies.

2302
01:35:57,920 --> 01:35:58,980
Thank you, thank you.

2303
01:36:01,540 --> 01:36:04,800
I'm so sorry for the voices, guys.

2304
01:36:04,960 --> 01:36:07,320
I couldn't take my meds, guys.

2305
01:36:07,480 --> 01:36:08,880
We needed intel.

2306
01:36:09,140 --> 01:36:10,340
I'm so...

2307
01:36:10,340 --> 01:36:15,880
I'm so sorry for the screaming earlier.

2308
01:36:19,840 --> 01:36:21,920
Bro, I'm so tired.

2309
01:36:22,720 --> 01:36:25,720
That one game exhausted me.

2310
01:36:26,440 --> 01:36:27,900
Oh my god.

2311
01:36:27,920 --> 01:36:32,720
That one fucking game actually exhausted me.

2312
01:36:32,760 --> 01:36:34,560
I actually had to mute somebody.

2313
01:36:34,860 --> 01:36:37,020
I was like, no, bro.

2314
01:36:37,620 --> 01:36:41,720
If this is a Stanford prison experiment, bro, I'm fucking...

2315
01:36:41,720 --> 01:36:42,800
Let me out.

2316
01:36:43,600 --> 01:36:45,600
Let me out of that prison.

2317
01:36:48,500 --> 01:36:51,240
The voices were so strong.

2318
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:53,560
Oh my god.

2319
01:36:53,660 --> 01:36:56,620
All that for 10 people to be eliminated.

2320
01:36:56,620 --> 01:36:58,180
That's the worst part.

2321
01:36:59,720 --> 01:37:02,960
Only 10 people were eliminated.

2322
01:37:03,880 --> 01:37:06,740
At least experiment subjects got paid.

2323
01:37:07,320 --> 01:37:09,000
Bro, I should get paid.

2324
01:37:09,180 --> 01:37:15,780
I should get paid for like the mental toll that took out of me.

2325
01:37:15,940 --> 01:37:17,540
It was good content.

2326
01:37:17,860 --> 01:37:20,080
Yeah, the next game is 30.

2327
01:37:20,540 --> 01:37:23,320
Bro, those puppets should have killed 20 people.

2328
01:37:23,700 --> 01:37:25,020
I don't understand.

2329
01:37:25,020 --> 01:37:28,900
Instead, they should have got a goddamn double kill.

2330
01:37:30,300 --> 01:37:32,920
Instead, they put us through hell.

2331
01:37:33,100 --> 01:37:37,420
They put us through hell for sick entertainment.

2332
01:37:39,640 --> 01:37:42,120
Bro, it's just a game.

2333
01:37:43,080 --> 01:37:44,480
Oh my god.

2334
01:37:46,200 --> 01:37:48,740
It might be just a game.

2335
01:37:49,100 --> 01:37:50,280
But my...

2336
01:37:50,280 --> 01:37:54,840
I felt like I just aged another 50 years playing this game.

2337
01:37:56,840 --> 01:37:59,640
Nobody gets paid until day 5.

2338
01:38:01,120 --> 01:38:02,920
The content of winning.

2339
01:38:03,360 --> 01:38:05,500
I was actually going crazy.

2340
01:38:05,940 --> 01:38:08,500
I was going goddamn crazy.

2341
01:38:08,640 --> 01:38:11,180
I thought I was going to turn into Joker.

2342
01:38:12,400 --> 01:38:13,660
I thought...

2343
01:38:14,620 --> 01:38:17,600
I thought I was going to turn into Joker right there.

2344
01:38:21,880 --> 01:38:23,360
Oh my god.

2345
01:38:25,020 --> 01:38:25,660
Oh, but it's over.

2346
01:38:25,880 --> 01:38:26,560
Day 10.

2347
01:38:26,620 --> 01:38:27,500
Game 2.

2348
01:38:27,780 --> 01:38:28,600
Prop hunt.

2349
01:38:29,620 --> 01:38:30,180
Yeah.

2350
01:38:32,160 --> 01:38:34,560
I'm going to die so fast as a prop.

2351
01:38:34,680 --> 01:38:36,860
Guys, knowing my luck, I'm going to get prop.

2352
01:38:37,340 --> 01:38:38,880
I'm going to get like...

2353
01:38:39,660 --> 01:38:40,220
Insta...

2354
01:38:40,220 --> 01:38:43,360
Insta fucking ganked by a hunter.

2355
01:38:44,680 --> 01:38:46,160
Jokey bird is coming back.

2356
01:38:46,420 --> 01:38:47,380
I had to mute.

2357
01:38:47,460 --> 01:38:48,060
I can't...

2358
01:38:48,060 --> 01:38:49,720
I can't...

2359
01:38:49,720 --> 01:38:51,300
I can't listen to the voices anymore.

2360
01:38:51,900 --> 01:38:52,840
I can't.

2361
01:38:53,700 --> 01:38:54,260
Guys.

2362
01:38:55,020 --> 01:38:56,460
Are they doing a...

2363
01:38:56,460 --> 01:38:58,400
Are they looking at a funeral for their friend?

2364
01:38:58,600 --> 01:38:59,120
Oh, they are.

2365
01:39:15,860 --> 01:39:17,060
Holy shit.

2366
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:19,600
Oh

2367
01:39:22,890 --> 01:39:23,590
my God.

2368
01:39:24,430 --> 01:39:26,450
I got it.

2369
01:39:30,590 --> 01:39:33,570
Okay, I don't think they're friends.

2370
01:39:33,770 --> 01:39:41,650
I don't... guys, I... I don't think that... I don't think that was... that was a friend, guys.

2371
01:39:43,690 --> 01:39:47,230
That was... that was definitely not for a friend.

2372
01:39:50,570 --> 01:39:54,810
Hello... hello... I'm here... I'm here...

2373
01:39:56,450 --> 01:39:57,310
Yeah, you made it.

2374
01:39:57,470 --> 01:39:59,010
I made it.

2375
01:39:59,370 --> 01:40:00,690
Were you ever hunted?

2376
01:40:01,170 --> 01:40:03,610
Yeah, I was hunted.

2377
01:40:07,050 --> 01:40:08,730
That means you didn't die.

2378
01:40:09,010 --> 01:40:10,170
All my other friends died.

2379
01:40:14,110 --> 01:40:16,130
This is helligumi.

2380
01:40:16,990 --> 01:40:19,010
That last game was hell.

2381
01:40:19,530 --> 01:40:22,610
I don't know if you're gonna like the next game anymore.

2382
01:40:22,890 --> 01:40:24,110
I think the next game's harder.

2383
01:40:24,910 --> 01:40:25,530
Yeah...

2384
01:40:26,450 --> 01:40:28,010
Me was a good run, Gumi.

2385
01:40:28,950 --> 01:40:31,790
Get to day four for me, Gumi.

2386
01:40:32,030 --> 01:40:33,750
I believe in you.

2387
01:40:35,230 --> 01:40:37,430
I believe in you, Gumi.

2388
01:40:37,630 --> 01:40:39,190
Live on for me.

2389
01:40:43,010 --> 01:40:44,210
Live on.

2390
01:40:44,450 --> 01:40:49,430
If you're a hunter and I'm a prop, I'll give you that one point, Gumi.

2391
01:40:49,810 --> 01:40:52,550
I don't know how to find you.

2392
01:40:52,790 --> 01:40:53,970
You'll know it's me.

2393
01:40:55,770 --> 01:40:59,010
You go into a room and you see a prop moving.

2394
01:40:59,870 --> 01:41:00,630
That's me.

2395
01:41:01,410 --> 01:41:03,410
You take that one point.

2396
01:41:03,570 --> 01:41:07,790
You take that one point and take it over the day for it, Gumi.

2397
01:41:09,550 --> 01:41:12,250
But we don't know how it's gonna be like.

2398
01:41:12,750 --> 01:41:17,190
It's basically... it's like a one for all.

2399
01:41:17,370 --> 01:41:18,190
That's what you said.

2400
01:41:19,450 --> 01:41:19,970
Maybe.

2401
01:41:20,070 --> 01:41:20,610
I don't know.

2402
01:41:20,870 --> 01:41:21,790
It can't be team.

2403
01:41:21,870 --> 01:41:22,090
It feels bad.

2404
01:41:22,090 --> 01:41:22,630
What?

2405
01:41:23,430 --> 01:41:25,310
Abe died because his game crashed.

2406
01:41:25,570 --> 01:41:26,210
Wait, really?

2407
01:41:26,810 --> 01:41:27,930
That's why he died?

2408
01:41:28,250 --> 01:41:29,090
You know what's funny?

2409
01:41:29,770 --> 01:41:33,770
Abe was like, we should sacrifice Doki to the monster.

2410
01:41:34,490 --> 01:41:36,690
And then he died like ten seconds later.

2411
01:41:50,350 --> 01:41:51,690
Dude, I'll be honest.

2412
01:41:51,810 --> 01:41:55,450
I was so ready to sacrifice any random that I saw.

2413
01:41:55,750 --> 01:41:58,070
Oh my god, nothing's chasing us.

2414
01:41:58,070 --> 01:42:00,510
Bro, I just wanted it to be over.

2415
01:42:00,770 --> 01:42:02,710
That shit was so stressful.

2416
01:42:03,470 --> 01:42:04,930
Like, the safe dolls...

2417
01:42:04,930 --> 01:42:05,350
Did you F5?

2418
01:42:05,750 --> 01:42:06,750
No, I didn't.

2419
01:42:06,770 --> 01:42:07,810
I just followed the crowd.

2420
01:42:08,110 --> 01:42:09,710
The safe zones didn't matter.

2421
01:42:09,870 --> 01:42:11,990
I did understand the safe dolls.

2422
01:42:12,510 --> 01:42:13,990
So, it didn't matter.

2423
01:42:14,110 --> 01:42:16,370
It was just until we got rid of all the dolls.

2424
01:42:16,450 --> 01:42:16,810
Yeah.

2425
01:42:16,810 --> 01:42:17,430
And ten people.

2426
01:42:17,550 --> 01:42:19,670
The safe zones actually did nothing.

2427
01:42:19,770 --> 01:42:20,570
Yeah, it did nothing.

2428
01:42:20,570 --> 01:42:22,350
It just prolonged the game.

2429
01:42:23,190 --> 01:42:23,690
Yeah.

2430
01:42:24,110 --> 01:42:25,990
And like, we had to choose all the dolls anyway.

2431
01:42:26,110 --> 01:42:26,930
So like, what's the point?

2432
01:42:26,930 --> 01:42:30,090
Yeah, and then like, even like, and then there's always majority.

2433
01:42:30,490 --> 01:42:31,310
Majority wins.

2434
01:42:31,790 --> 01:42:33,390
So like, it doesn't matter what we choose.

2435
01:42:33,950 --> 01:42:35,330
Illusion of choice of illusion.

2436
01:42:36,530 --> 01:42:40,270
Yeah, and then one guy was screaming at the top of his... I muted that guy.

2437
01:42:41,070 --> 01:42:42,050
There was one...

2438
01:42:42,050 --> 01:42:42,470
Who's it?

2439
01:42:42,550 --> 01:42:42,790
Tell me.

2440
01:42:42,790 --> 01:42:43,090
Who's it?

2441
01:42:43,150 --> 01:42:43,950
Oh, you're gonna mute him too?

2442
01:42:44,830 --> 01:42:46,350
Yeah, it's the sap guy.

2443
01:42:49,070 --> 01:42:50,650
I know who you're talking about.

2444
01:42:51,770 --> 01:42:53,190
Yeah, I muted him.

2445
01:42:53,310 --> 01:42:55,130
I was like, chat, tell me who it is.

2446
01:42:55,210 --> 01:42:55,810
I can't.

2447
01:42:55,810 --> 01:42:59,990
But I cannot hear him yell at me, yell at everybody anymore.

2448
01:43:00,210 --> 01:43:01,030
I can't.

2449
01:43:02,650 --> 01:43:08,430
Oh no, yeah, I kept muting until like, it got mid-round just to hear if someone's coming or not.

2450
01:43:08,630 --> 01:43:12,910
Yeah, I like, kept it on the entire time because I was so scared.

2451
01:43:12,910 --> 01:43:14,550
I was so scared that I was gonna die.

2452
01:43:15,670 --> 01:43:18,290
No, I was like, kind of getting pissed off.

2453
01:43:18,410 --> 01:43:20,270
Oh no, I was just crying.

2454
01:43:20,830 --> 01:43:21,590
I was crying.

2455
01:43:21,610 --> 01:43:24,990
Like, I feel like loud does not equal funny, so I was just getting it wrong.

2456
01:43:24,990 --> 01:43:27,530
Yeah, it was just not funny.

2457
01:43:28,350 --> 01:43:31,730
Like, unless you say something funny, but they weren't saying anything funny.

2458
01:43:33,190 --> 01:43:34,930
This is the person I lied to on day one.

2459
01:43:35,050 --> 01:43:35,550
I feel bad.

2460
01:43:35,650 --> 01:43:35,790
This one?

2461
01:43:35,810 --> 01:43:36,430
Rest in peace.

2462
01:43:36,690 --> 01:43:37,390
I don't.

2463
01:43:40,510 --> 01:43:44,770
I learned that from, I learned that from the Spanish people.

2464
01:43:45,050 --> 01:43:47,270
I unmuted and they were spitting at somebody's grave.

2465
01:43:51,890 --> 01:43:55,570
Yeah, yeah, I was like, oh look, they're paying respect to their dead friend.

2466
01:43:55,570 --> 01:44:00,190
And then I unmuted, and it was just a group of people, like, spitting on his grave.

2467
01:44:00,330 --> 01:44:01,730
I was like, oh, I don't think that's a friend.

2468
01:44:01,970 --> 01:44:02,710
I don't...

2469
01:44:06,130 --> 01:44:07,770
Yeah, I'm watering the grass a little bit.

2470
01:44:07,790 --> 01:44:08,130
Yeah, yeah.

2471
01:44:10,110 --> 01:44:12,010
A VTuber lived longer than you.

2472
01:44:17,700 --> 01:44:20,660
Oh shit, wait, we're on the same channel!

2473
01:44:20,980 --> 01:44:22,240
I'm so sorry.

2474
01:44:23,100 --> 01:44:24,200
I'm sorry, Eva.

2475
01:44:24,240 --> 01:44:26,180
Sorry, sorry, we're sorry, we're sorry.

2476
01:44:26,380 --> 01:44:27,000
We're sorry.

2477
01:44:30,040 --> 01:44:30,840
Okay, are we off yet?

2478
01:44:35,620 --> 01:44:37,120
She's watering the flowers, man.

2479
01:44:37,120 --> 01:44:39,280
We're watering the flowers, we're watering the flowers.

2480
01:44:42,540 --> 01:44:43,160
Who's next?

2481
01:44:44,800 --> 01:44:47,140
Okay, that's not me, guys, that's not me.

2482
01:44:49,380 --> 01:44:51,300
They heard all of it, Gumi.

2483
01:44:53,400 --> 01:44:57,360
We're just paying respect by help making sure the flowers.

2484
01:44:57,820 --> 01:44:57,860
Yeah, we're watering the flowers.

2485
01:44:57,860 --> 01:44:58,240
Yeah.

2486
01:44:58,760 --> 01:44:59,120
Yeah.

2487
01:44:59,220 --> 01:44:59,260
Yeah.

2488
01:45:01,300 --> 01:45:01,660
Yeah.

2489
01:45:03,700 --> 01:45:04,060
Yeah.

2490
01:45:04,060 --> 01:45:05,640
See, Mendo has no flowers.

2491
01:45:05,640 --> 01:45:08,120
Yeah, yeah, because nobody paid respect to him.

2492
01:45:08,640 --> 01:45:09,540
How are we doing, guys?

2493
01:45:11,160 --> 01:45:12,000
Scared, but confident?

2494
01:45:12,720 --> 01:45:13,080
Yeah.

2495
01:45:13,180 --> 01:45:13,560
Who's next?

2496
01:45:13,740 --> 01:45:16,240
We're making sure, we're making sure that they're hydrated.

2497
01:45:17,660 --> 01:45:20,600
Oh, this one I can't spit on, I'm going to throw it back on the floor.

2498
01:45:20,600 --> 01:45:21,340
Oh, we gotta say goodbye to Gumi.

2499
01:45:21,340 --> 01:45:21,720
Me too.

2500
01:45:21,840 --> 01:45:23,340
I don't know who they are, but I will too.

2501
01:45:23,580 --> 01:45:25,340
We're gonna say goodbye to the red velvet.

2502
01:45:25,560 --> 01:45:26,880
I didn't mean to say goodbye to Gumi.

2503
01:45:27,060 --> 01:45:27,360
Oh, no.

2504
01:45:27,360 --> 01:45:28,220
We gotta say goodbye to red velvet.

2505
01:45:57,120 --> 01:46:00,920
I don't remember the rest.

2506
01:46:02,360 --> 01:46:05,420
I don't know who this person is, but 07.

2507
01:46:05,820 --> 01:46:07,080
Is this the guy that you were talking about?

2508
01:46:07,460 --> 01:46:08,340
You don't like this guy?

2509
01:46:08,720 --> 01:46:10,380
No, this guy didn't even follow me back on Twitter.

2510
01:46:11,180 --> 01:46:11,540
Damn!

2511
01:46:11,720 --> 01:46:12,780
Who is this guy?

2512
01:46:12,940 --> 01:46:13,620
Who is this guy?

2513
01:46:15,320 --> 01:46:17,220
Wait, did he get out in this last game?

2514
01:46:17,440 --> 01:46:18,400
No, yesterday.

2515
01:46:19,540 --> 01:46:24,580
I was gonna say, we had a run from the beast, but surely you'd think Sonic would be fast.

2516
01:46:24,900 --> 01:46:25,580
Clearly not.

2517
01:46:25,580 --> 01:46:25,940
Oh!

2518
01:46:26,200 --> 01:46:26,340
Oh!

2519
01:46:28,640 --> 01:46:30,400
No, they lost in the task one.

2520
01:46:30,560 --> 01:46:32,580
The puzzle, quote on quote.

2521
01:46:33,360 --> 01:46:33,800
Damn.

2522
01:46:34,120 --> 01:46:37,500
So he might be fast with his feet, but he's not fast with his brain.

2523
01:46:37,940 --> 01:46:38,120
Oh!

2524
01:46:39,260 --> 01:46:40,780
Oh my god, look, it's me!

2525
01:46:41,560 --> 01:46:42,340
I see you!

2526
01:46:43,020 --> 01:46:45,260
And dead bodies to the left and right of you.

2527
01:46:45,520 --> 01:46:47,200
Yeah, all my friends are freaking dead.

2528
01:46:47,200 --> 01:46:48,700
No, they're still... Bear!

2529
01:46:48,880 --> 01:46:49,760
Bear's still alive!

2530
01:46:51,160 --> 01:46:51,920
Mr. Bear!

2531
01:46:52,020 --> 01:46:54,240
Yeah, Wally's still alive.

2532
01:46:54,780 --> 01:46:55,920
Where's your grave, Doki?

2533
01:46:56,060 --> 01:46:57,020
Mine's all the way back here.

2534
01:46:57,600 --> 01:46:58,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2535
01:46:59,480 --> 01:47:01,520
Is it alphabetical?

2536
01:47:01,820 --> 01:47:03,920
Yeah, yeah, so I get the front.

2537
01:47:04,100 --> 01:47:05,140
Shay, wanna hear something funny?

2538
01:47:06,440 --> 01:47:08,080
Doki hard-muted Sapnap.

2539
01:47:08,580 --> 01:47:08,980
That's funny.

2540
01:47:09,960 --> 01:47:11,120
I think it's so funny.

2541
01:47:11,620 --> 01:47:12,760
I mean, I don't blame you.

2542
01:47:12,880 --> 01:47:13,960
He was screaming!

2543
01:47:14,160 --> 01:47:16,280
I was like, I clearly can't focus!

2544
01:47:16,420 --> 01:47:17,720
During the last game...

2545
01:47:18,700 --> 01:47:19,100
Yeah?

2546
01:47:19,720 --> 01:47:20,940
Oh, you muted him during the last game?

2547
01:47:20,940 --> 01:47:22,820
Yeah, during the last game I muted him.

2548
01:47:22,900 --> 01:47:24,220
I was like, chat, who is this guy?

2549
01:47:24,240 --> 01:47:25,180
He's the person that keeps yelling!

2550
01:47:25,420 --> 01:47:27,020
And everybody just said, you're that guy.

2551
01:47:27,360 --> 01:47:35,100
So, that might have been my fault because I had a strategy and he was like right next to me and I knew people would listen to him because he just screams.

2552
01:47:36,680 --> 01:47:37,080
Yeah?

2553
01:47:37,620 --> 01:47:38,020
Okay.

2554
01:47:39,020 --> 01:47:39,840
Oh, okay.

2555
01:47:41,260 --> 01:47:43,300
Eight people get selected.

2556
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:48,280
Oh, so you have to like survive and you get points and you complete tasks and you get points.

2557
01:47:50,820 --> 01:47:51,280
Don't mind!

2558
01:47:51,280 --> 01:47:52,620
What are these?

2559
01:47:52,700 --> 01:47:54,620
Oh, you respawn if you're a hunter as a pro.

2560
01:47:54,880 --> 01:47:56,060
Bro, what the heck?

2561
01:47:56,120 --> 01:47:58,380
This rules is like an essay.

2562
01:47:59,460 --> 01:48:00,880
They'll show a video, man.

2563
01:48:00,920 --> 01:48:01,780
They'll show you a video.

2564
01:48:03,380 --> 01:48:04,820
Monsters upon respawning.

2565
01:48:05,020 --> 01:48:06,160
Monsters will still be monsters.

2566
01:48:07,040 --> 01:48:10,660
Players will be able to select a monster class which they will want to play next.

2567
01:48:11,180 --> 01:48:11,200
What?

2568
01:48:11,940 --> 01:48:12,880
That's what I'm saying!

2569
01:48:13,020 --> 01:48:14,340
It's a goddamn essay!

2570
01:48:15,040 --> 01:48:15,420
Maybe.

2571
01:48:16,280 --> 01:48:23,800
So, my best thing I'd say is obviously try to complete tasks but I'd say try to get those survival points because it might come down to just simple points.

2572
01:48:24,100 --> 01:48:24,440
Yeah.

2573
01:48:24,960 --> 01:48:27,860
Wait, so what do you mean by it's your fault?

2574
01:48:28,220 --> 01:48:29,060
What did you do?

2575
01:48:29,360 --> 01:48:36,180
So, basically the way that last game worked is whatever color got picked, that's where they would start spawning.

2576
01:48:36,720 --> 01:48:47,160
So, I wanted them to spawn on the opposite side so we had as much time to run and Sapnep was the person to my right so I was like, Sapnep, just get them all to pick the other side.

2577
01:48:48,020 --> 01:48:49,120
You made that!

2578
01:48:49,540 --> 01:48:49,680
It was you!

2579
01:48:49,840 --> 01:48:51,720
It was you all along!

2580
01:48:53,080 --> 01:48:54,040
I'm sorry!

2581
01:48:54,860 --> 01:48:56,060
Alright, I'm sorry.

2582
01:48:56,440 --> 01:48:59,400
My chat had to pay for my therapy for that game!

2583
01:49:00,700 --> 01:49:02,460
My bad, my bad, my bad.

2584
01:49:02,840 --> 01:49:04,780
Oh my god, it was him!

2585
01:49:04,940 --> 01:49:06,240
He was the mastermind!

2586
01:49:06,500 --> 01:49:12,460
As a hunter, you just get points for killing someone but you don't want to hit the wrong people because then you lose points.

2587
01:49:13,200 --> 01:49:17,800
Divide into two groups props and hunters And then it just leaves my points to get eliminated.

2588
01:49:19,540 --> 01:49:21,160
Start as hunters with the remaining...

2589
01:49:21,160 --> 01:49:22,580
Oh my god, there's so much reading!

2590
01:49:24,180 --> 01:49:27,380
Each round, eight participants start as hunters while the remaining will start as props.

2591
01:49:27,560 --> 01:49:30,460
A total of four rounds of playing elimination will occur after all rounds have been played.

2592
01:49:30,680 --> 01:49:32,680
Rounds will be randomly selected.

2593
01:49:32,920 --> 01:49:35,120
If a player dies, they will have a cooldown before they may respawn.

2594
01:49:35,360 --> 01:49:37,200
Props become monsters upon respawning.

2595
01:49:37,260 --> 01:49:39,440
While as monsters, there will still be monsters in both cases.

2596
01:49:39,660 --> 01:49:41,440
Players will be able to select which they want to play next.

2597
01:49:41,540 --> 01:49:44,760
Each group has specific game objectives they must achieve as...

2598
01:49:44,760 --> 01:49:46,060
Oh my god!

2599
01:49:46,060 --> 01:49:46,120
Ah!

2600
01:49:48,740 --> 01:49:49,140
Bro!

2601
01:49:50,200 --> 01:49:51,000
That's... okay.

2602
01:49:51,420 --> 01:49:52,000
Props gameplay.

2603
01:49:52,260 --> 01:49:54,440
As props, players must survive as much as possible.

2604
01:49:54,580 --> 01:49:57,500
If a player survives for at least five minutes during a set round, the player will earn points.

2605
01:49:57,740 --> 01:50:01,780
Props can activate door locks to help running from the hunters but there's a point penalty by each.

2606
01:50:01,960 --> 01:50:03,820
Props will also be given four quests to complete.

2607
01:50:03,940 --> 01:50:07,860
Upon completing a quest, the player can earn special items and will also earn points.

2608
01:50:08,060 --> 01:50:13,020
Props can solidify on other objects by pressing F at positions they would like.

2609
01:50:13,020 --> 01:50:15,740
They can also ship ship each other objects by clicking at them.

2610
01:50:15,820 --> 01:50:22,120
Prop disguise includes but are not limited to skulls, kennels, holders, pots, statues, chairs, etc.

2611
01:50:22,500 --> 01:50:29,440
An anti-AFK system is applied to the game, making props visible to everyone if they stay in the same position for 60 seconds.

2612
01:50:29,640 --> 01:50:34,420
The AFK debuff will be removed once the player moves at least four blocks away from the position.

2613
01:50:34,680 --> 01:50:36,360
If a prop is defeated by a hunter...

2614
01:50:36,910 --> 01:50:37,640
There's more?

2615
01:50:37,880 --> 01:50:42,800
Okay guys, there's like an elimination paragraph as well.

2616
01:50:43,380 --> 01:50:54,840
Hahahaha As hunters, players will have to select one out of three available hunting classes, each ummm each possessing different abilities.

2617
01:50:55,180 --> 01:50:57,800
They can be used every few minutes to give them some advantage.

2618
01:50:58,180 --> 01:51:02,380
These can be selected at the start of each round and also hunters must defeat as many props as possible.

2619
01:51:02,540 --> 01:51:03,700
Defeating a prop will give you a point.

2620
01:51:03,820 --> 01:51:06,400
Hunters must pay close attention before striking objects.

2621
01:51:06,560 --> 01:51:09,220
Once hitting regular will have deals they will die.

2622
01:51:10,140 --> 01:51:11,640
Participate all rounds or government.

2623
01:51:13,080 --> 01:51:15,280
Survive ten minutes plus two points.

2624
01:51:15,420 --> 01:51:17,460
Complete a task plus five.

2625
01:51:17,780 --> 01:51:20,160
Defeat a prop plus five points.

2626
01:51:20,440 --> 01:51:22,100
Incorrect prop hit minus two.

2627
01:51:24,120 --> 01:51:24,760
Alright.

2628
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:26,640
Okay.

2629
01:51:26,820 --> 01:51:27,460
Alright.

2630
01:51:27,600 --> 01:51:28,800
I read a lot of that.

2631
01:51:29,200 --> 01:51:30,140
Alright guys.

2632
01:51:30,980 --> 01:51:32,220
Alright guys.

2633
01:51:32,360 --> 01:51:33,880
We gotta be in emote only mode.

2634
01:51:36,240 --> 01:51:37,660
Emote only mode.

2635
01:51:37,800 --> 01:51:39,120
I finished reading two.

2636
01:51:39,300 --> 01:51:41,040
That was like three goddamn pages.

2637
01:51:41,040 --> 01:51:42,960
That was like a goddamn essay.

2638
01:51:46,680 --> 01:51:47,900
Good luck guys.

2639
01:51:48,780 --> 01:51:50,820
I hope you make it to day four Gumi.

2640
01:51:51,100 --> 01:51:52,300
Rest in peace Gun Teddy.

2641
01:51:52,840 --> 01:51:53,620
Rest in peace.

2642
01:51:56,200 --> 01:51:57,520
Rest in peace funny guy.

2643
01:51:57,800 --> 01:52:00,360
I'll never know actually how funny you were.

2644
01:52:01,720 --> 01:52:02,180
Huh?

2645
01:52:02,440 --> 01:52:03,680
You say something I was peeing.

2646
01:52:05,520 --> 01:52:05,980
Okay.

2647
01:52:06,240 --> 01:52:06,700
Gumi.

2648
01:52:06,920 --> 01:52:08,820
I believe in you to make it to day four.

2649
01:52:08,820 --> 01:52:09,600
Do it for me.

2650
01:52:09,720 --> 01:52:10,700
Do it for everybody.

2651
01:52:11,340 --> 01:52:12,720
Do it for our fans.

2652
01:52:14,180 --> 01:52:14,580
Okay.

2653
01:52:14,640 --> 01:52:15,300
Just do...

2654
01:52:15,300 --> 01:52:16,920
Try to do more tasks than surviving.

2655
01:52:17,240 --> 01:52:17,480
Okay.

2656
01:52:17,780 --> 01:52:18,980
I think it's gonna come down to points.

2657
01:52:19,040 --> 01:52:19,400
Yeah.

2658
01:52:19,400 --> 01:52:19,600
Yeah.

2659
01:52:19,700 --> 01:52:19,880
Yeah.

2660
01:52:19,960 --> 01:52:21,060
I'll try my best.

2661
01:52:21,620 --> 01:52:22,720
I'll try my best.

2662
01:52:22,760 --> 01:52:24,180
This will be the last time we can talk.

2663
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:25,400
Oh.

2664
01:52:25,400 --> 01:52:25,800
Okay.

2665
01:52:25,860 --> 01:52:26,160
Nevermind.

2666
01:52:27,020 --> 01:52:27,420
Nevermind.

2667
01:52:28,700 --> 01:52:31,320
We can still talk.

2668
01:52:31,480 --> 01:52:31,800
Oh yeah.

2669
01:52:31,860 --> 01:52:33,000
Do you put emote only mode?

2670
01:52:34,420 --> 01:52:34,820
Yeah.

2671
01:52:34,840 --> 01:52:35,340
I'm about to.

2672
01:52:35,340 --> 01:52:35,820
Yeah.

2673
01:52:36,020 --> 01:52:39,000
They said in general that they need to ensure everyone is in it.

2674
01:52:39,160 --> 01:52:39,520
Ah.

2675
01:52:40,980 --> 01:52:41,540
Yeah.

2676
01:52:41,640 --> 01:52:42,900
I put mine in just now.

2677
01:52:44,860 --> 01:52:45,920
Oh my god.

2678
01:52:46,200 --> 01:52:46,340
Oh my god.

2679
01:52:46,520 --> 01:52:48,420
What a freaking diabolical plan.

2680
01:52:48,420 --> 01:52:50,200
What a freaking diabolical plan.

2681
01:52:50,920 --> 01:52:52,700
To use sap for that.

2682
01:52:53,340 --> 01:52:55,300
That shit actually made me crazy.

2683
01:52:55,740 --> 01:52:57,880
That shit actually made me crazy.

2684
01:52:57,880 --> 01:53:01,560
My chat and I were like mentally drained.

2685
01:53:02,240 --> 01:53:02,460
My chat and I were like mentally drained.

2686
01:53:02,460 --> 01:53:04,240
I actually didn't hear the plan.

2687
01:53:06,320 --> 01:53:06,800
Oh.

2688
01:53:06,960 --> 01:53:09,080
Basically, what he did...

2689
01:53:09,080 --> 01:53:16,340
What your friend did was that he convinced sap to yell as loud as he can to convince people to go on the other side of the map.

2690
01:53:16,800 --> 01:53:17,680
So like...

2691
01:53:17,680 --> 01:53:21,800
Him and their friends would be like on the other side.

2692
01:53:21,980 --> 01:53:23,160
So the monster...

2693
01:53:23,160 --> 01:53:27,120
The puppet would chase the people on the majority of the...

2694
01:53:27,120 --> 01:53:28,340
of the colors.

2695
01:53:29,860 --> 01:53:32,740
So like the people on the other side get to have like a free run.

2696
01:53:32,960 --> 01:53:34,740
Like a free... uh...

2697
01:53:35,880 --> 01:53:37,380
Free reset, I guess.

2698
01:53:38,520 --> 01:53:39,760
Ah, I see.

2699
01:53:39,820 --> 01:53:47,680
So yeah, he convinced sap to like yell as loud as he can to put everybody in one square while their group were on the other opposite side.

2700
01:53:50,990 --> 01:53:52,570
And that was so evil.

2701
01:53:52,870 --> 01:53:57,110
I can't believe us spitting on E-Rob's grave was on the main channel.

2702
01:53:59,370 --> 01:54:00,830
I can't believe.

2703
01:54:01,050 --> 01:54:02,850
Dude, why did he put that on the main channel?

2704
01:54:03,030 --> 01:54:03,350
Yeah!

2705
01:54:03,590 --> 01:54:06,050
We were doing so many other things!

2706
01:54:07,550 --> 01:54:13,930
We were doing so many things like feeding the orphans, watering flowers, helping cats out of trees.

2707
01:54:14,070 --> 01:54:17,830
We were like showing people where the eggs are and everything.

2708
01:54:17,990 --> 01:54:19,490
Being a good citizen.

2709
01:54:19,850 --> 01:54:22,610
And then they show us spitting on E-Rob's grave.

2710
01:54:26,870 --> 01:54:28,690
I can't believe it.

2711
01:54:30,970 --> 01:54:32,270
This is like...

2712
01:54:33,090 --> 01:54:33,470
Propaganda.

2713
01:54:35,230 --> 01:54:35,870
Propaganda?

2714
01:54:35,870 --> 01:54:37,470
Why did you use that word?

2715
01:54:37,590 --> 01:54:39,550
It's negative propaganda against us.

2716
01:54:39,750 --> 01:54:40,510
It's slander!

2717
01:54:43,290 --> 01:54:44,410
It's slander!

2718
01:54:47,550 --> 01:54:48,650
Oh my god.

2719
01:54:49,210 --> 01:54:52,010
This is the longest five seconds in the world.

2720
01:54:54,990 --> 01:54:59,550
That's crazy that they have to check each individual stream if we're in emo only mode.

2721
01:55:00,370 --> 01:55:01,430
You were wrong.

2722
01:55:02,510 --> 01:55:04,810
It's easier to be a prop in this game mode.

2723
01:55:05,990 --> 01:55:06,550
Why?

2724
01:55:07,090 --> 01:55:08,070
Oh, to get tasks.

2725
01:55:08,250 --> 01:55:08,390
Yeah.

2726
01:55:08,670 --> 01:55:09,650
What with the new points?

2727
01:55:09,750 --> 01:55:09,950
Yeah.

2728
01:55:10,470 --> 01:55:11,830
Because I thought they were gonna...

2729
01:55:13,730 --> 01:55:14,110
Yeah?

2730
01:55:15,430 --> 01:55:19,230
Because the hunters get minus two points if they hit something wrong.

2731
01:55:19,350 --> 01:55:19,590
Yeah.

2732
01:55:19,910 --> 01:55:20,530
That's true.

2733
01:55:20,970 --> 01:55:22,230
So it's kind of doomed.

2734
01:55:22,410 --> 01:55:24,550
I'm just thinking how...

2735
01:55:25,910 --> 01:55:27,410
There's so many props too.

2736
01:55:27,590 --> 01:55:28,730
What if it's just a hitbox?

2737
01:55:29,070 --> 01:55:29,290
You know?

2738
01:55:31,970 --> 01:55:34,710
Like the messed up hitbox that freaks you up.

2739
01:55:34,870 --> 01:55:35,490
Freaks you up.

2740
01:55:40,630 --> 01:55:41,070
Yeah.

2741
01:55:41,070 --> 01:55:43,710
So I think everybody should get a chance to play hunter once, right?

2742
01:55:43,930 --> 01:55:44,950
Or is it like...

2743
01:55:44,950 --> 01:55:46,290
It could be RNG though.

2744
01:55:47,830 --> 01:55:48,790
Yeah, it's RNG.

2745
01:55:49,530 --> 01:55:49,970
Yeah.

2746
01:55:51,830 --> 01:55:54,870
But then when you die as a prop, you get respawned as a hunter.

2747
01:55:55,950 --> 01:55:58,530
So we have to also hunt as a prop.

2748
01:55:58,790 --> 01:56:00,170
As we die.

2749
01:56:03,350 --> 01:56:03,790
Right?

2750
01:56:03,790 --> 01:56:04,850
Unless I misread it.

2751
01:56:07,150 --> 01:56:07,630
Huh?

2752
01:56:07,730 --> 01:56:08,290
I wasn't listening.

2753
01:56:08,930 --> 01:56:13,070
I said if we get caught as a prop, we have to hunt after that.

2754
01:56:13,370 --> 01:56:14,690
Yeah, you become a hunter next.

2755
01:56:15,750 --> 01:56:18,910
Yeah, so it's just like living as long as you can, doing tasks.

2756
01:56:20,390 --> 01:56:20,870
Yeah.

2757
01:56:21,410 --> 01:56:22,270
I just...

2758
01:56:22,270 --> 01:56:25,130
There were so many words.

2759
01:56:25,950 --> 01:56:27,350
There were so many...

2760
01:56:27,350 --> 01:56:28,930
It's okay, they're gonna play a video.

2761
01:56:29,090 --> 01:56:29,890
Thank god.

2762
01:56:29,890 --> 01:56:30,950
The video will help a lot.

2763
01:56:30,970 --> 01:56:31,730
I need the visuals.

2764
01:56:33,750 --> 01:56:36,170
I need my coco melon.

2765
01:56:36,210 --> 01:56:37,690
I need my coco melon.

2766
01:56:37,890 --> 01:56:38,230
Please.

2767
01:56:38,470 --> 01:56:40,250
Coco melon.

2768
01:56:41,610 --> 01:56:44,630
To be fair, the video on the last game was not helpful at all.

2769
01:56:45,250 --> 01:56:47,670
Because it implied that you're safe.

2770
01:56:47,850 --> 01:56:49,670
That it's not majority.

2771
01:56:50,450 --> 01:56:52,810
I didn't even say that in the rules either.

2772
01:56:53,050 --> 01:56:53,350
Yeah.

2773
01:56:56,930 --> 01:56:57,450
I...

2774
01:56:58,370 --> 01:57:03,190
It was a time It would've been helpful knowing the dolls had abilities and showing which doll had what ability.

2775
01:57:03,310 --> 01:57:04,310
Like the fireball kind.

2776
01:57:04,330 --> 01:57:04,610
Yeah.

2777
01:57:04,630 --> 01:57:09,750
I feel like this game is really well coded though.

2778
01:57:10,090 --> 01:57:13,470
It's well coded, but I feel like they should've tested the games more.

2779
01:57:15,590 --> 01:57:20,850
Like, I feel like there's so many things that could've been adjusted if the games were tested a little bit more.

2780
01:57:21,810 --> 01:57:23,130
Like the tiebreaker one.

2781
01:57:23,270 --> 01:57:24,630
Do you remember the tiebreaker on day one?

2782
01:57:25,310 --> 01:57:29,870
And how there's barely enough time for people to do the tiebreaker.

2783
01:57:30,390 --> 01:57:31,510
If they got cursed.

2784
01:57:33,410 --> 01:57:34,570
Stuff like that.

2785
01:57:34,770 --> 01:57:35,770
I got the info about that.

2786
01:57:35,950 --> 01:57:41,230
Apparently you can see the person who's cursed, but you can't see the people who aren't cursed.

2787
01:57:41,490 --> 01:57:42,670
It's like the other thing.

2788
01:57:42,850 --> 01:57:47,090
Oh, so like the people who are cursed don't even know where they are.

2789
01:57:48,390 --> 01:57:50,950
No, but here Dokia, I'll teach you a trick.

2790
01:57:52,190 --> 01:57:57,310
If you play F5 and you just run around like this, you can scan around the area better.

2791
01:57:58,010 --> 01:57:58,490
Oh.

2792
01:57:59,890 --> 01:58:05,690
People keep telling me to play F5, but like, I'm so bad at moving when it comes to F5.

2793
01:58:06,870 --> 01:58:07,350
Play.

2794
01:58:08,210 --> 01:58:09,170
Monsters earn...

2795
01:58:10,170 --> 01:58:12,410
Monsters earn five points by killing props.

2796
01:58:12,650 --> 01:58:14,450
You don't lose points for doing a puzzle incorrectly.

2797
01:58:15,150 --> 01:58:18,750
If you die by killing a false prop as a hunter, you have to respawn.

2798
01:58:18,770 --> 01:58:21,070
Respawn timers are 120 seconds.

2799
01:58:21,430 --> 01:58:23,370
Wait, that's a lot.

2800
01:58:23,990 --> 01:58:24,910
Dying is bad.

2801
01:58:25,190 --> 01:58:26,730
60 seconds in fourth round.

2802
01:58:27,730 --> 01:58:28,250
Holy...

2803
01:58:28,250 --> 01:58:29,130
Oh, wow.

2804
01:58:31,850 --> 01:58:32,970
Wait, that's...

2805
01:58:32,970 --> 01:58:34,010
Dying is just bad.

2806
01:58:35,090 --> 01:58:35,930
Yeah, I agree.

2807
01:58:36,650 --> 01:58:37,890
That's like so long.

2808
01:58:38,270 --> 01:58:39,310
Might as well just stand still.

2809
01:58:41,210 --> 01:58:42,710
Well, there's the timer.

2810
01:58:42,730 --> 01:58:44,110
60 seconds AFK timer.

2811
01:58:44,370 --> 01:58:45,070
Oh, true.

2812
01:58:45,790 --> 01:58:48,730
But still, I feel like...

2813
01:58:48,730 --> 01:58:50,170
Wait, hold on.

2814
01:58:50,530 --> 01:58:52,410
Let's go discuss with my Minecraft friends.

2815
01:58:52,570 --> 01:58:54,050
Yeah, that's true.

2816
01:58:54,050 --> 01:58:56,390
We should have been talking about strats with them.

2817
01:58:59,730 --> 01:59:06,270
Well, I guess we do have to play F5 chat because it's a prop, so we have to know where people are.

2818
01:59:07,550 --> 01:59:09,650
It doesn't say anything about losing points.

2819
01:59:09,690 --> 01:59:14,190
You just gotta... Like, when you die as a prop, you become a hunter, so you just gotta stay locked in no matter what you are, honestly.

2820
01:59:14,470 --> 01:59:17,730
Like, either do your tasks or go for prop kills.

2821
01:59:18,010 --> 01:59:18,310
Gumi!

2822
01:59:18,450 --> 01:59:18,710
Gumi!

2823
01:59:18,830 --> 01:59:19,070
Gumi!

2824
01:59:19,370 --> 01:59:19,650
Hi!

2825
01:59:21,510 --> 01:59:22,930
Did you guys see the TV below the table?

2826
01:59:24,690 --> 01:59:25,370
Made you look.

2827
01:59:26,030 --> 01:59:27,070
Yeah, I don't believe you.

2828
01:59:28,090 --> 01:59:28,490
Evil.

2829
01:59:28,710 --> 01:59:29,890
I'm not helping you next time.

2830
01:59:29,910 --> 01:59:30,410
I looked.

2831
01:59:30,410 --> 01:59:30,950
I'm not gonna lie.

2832
01:59:30,990 --> 01:59:31,330
I didn't look.

2833
01:59:32,510 --> 01:59:34,850
This one over here looks like a TV.

2834
01:59:38,310 --> 01:59:39,350
I believe it.

2835
01:59:39,830 --> 01:59:40,410
Oh, I'm here.

2836
01:59:40,570 --> 01:59:40,890
I'm coming.

2837
01:59:41,010 --> 01:59:41,170
I'm coming.

2838
01:59:42,530 --> 01:59:43,130
I'm alright.

2839
01:59:43,370 --> 01:59:45,070
I feel like this is the one I get out.

2840
01:59:45,310 --> 01:59:46,530
Already discussing strats?

2841
01:59:47,330 --> 01:59:48,190
Hey, what's the strat?

2842
01:59:48,330 --> 01:59:52,030
The strat is to do a speedrun, depending on the map.

2843
01:59:52,030 --> 01:59:53,030
You speedrun the tasks.

2844
01:59:53,130 --> 01:59:54,010
That's what I thought, yeah.

2845
01:59:54,150 --> 01:59:54,730
And then you int.

2846
01:59:55,010 --> 01:59:57,370
And then you become a hunter, so you can get the points.

2847
01:59:57,590 --> 01:59:59,810
Because, like, you don't really get many minuses.

2848
01:59:59,810 --> 02:00:01,450
You just need to be careful as a hunter to not hit the wrong things.

2849
02:00:01,510 --> 02:00:03,370
I would only ever hit something if you see it moving, honestly.

2850
02:00:03,730 --> 02:00:04,050
Really?

2851
02:00:04,050 --> 02:00:04,950
You want to try to survive?

2852
02:00:05,730 --> 02:00:07,170
No, because it's only two points for survival.

2853
02:00:07,730 --> 02:00:08,910
But, like, if you get hit, you just die.

2854
02:00:08,910 --> 02:00:12,070
It's five points for kill, and it's only two for survival every five minutes.

2855
02:00:12,190 --> 02:00:14,050
You get so many more points for killing.

2856
02:00:14,450 --> 02:00:16,410
Did you see the message they sent in general chat?

2857
02:00:16,670 --> 02:00:20,830
That the respawn timer is 120 seconds for the first two rounds or three rounds?

2858
02:00:21,250 --> 02:00:28,070
So, if you can speedrun your tasks fast and then die, you can probably get a hunter within, like, five minutes-ish when you respawn, and you can just get a lot of points killing people.

2859
02:00:28,230 --> 02:00:29,770
And they can't do anything because they're on respawn.

2860
02:00:30,590 --> 02:00:34,210
I mean, depending on, like, how far you want to, like, try and game the system.

2861
02:00:34,550 --> 02:00:38,810
I wonder if, like, props have, like, certain speeds, just like prop hunt.

2862
02:00:40,010 --> 02:00:43,990
I assume it's going to be, like, that we all move, like, the same amount of speed, where you have to move a little faster.

2863
02:00:44,170 --> 02:00:45,310
I feel like hunters should move faster, honestly.

2864
02:00:45,470 --> 02:00:47,890
Like, the smaller the prop you are, the faster you can be.

2865
02:00:48,010 --> 02:00:48,870
But you have less HP.

2866
02:00:50,290 --> 02:00:53,150
Yeah, I want to know, like, how much HP you have with, like, large things, or if it's, like, one hit.

2867
02:00:53,310 --> 02:00:55,250
Yeah, because I feel like large items should have more HP.

2868
02:00:56,030 --> 02:01:00,670
Skull, lantern, like, candle, chair, and something else, right?

2869
02:01:01,190 --> 02:01:02,230
There's only a couple of small things.

2870
02:01:02,470 --> 02:01:03,470
Like, it would be things like this, I think.

2871
02:01:03,530 --> 02:01:05,390
Oh my god, there's a squad of FBI.

2872
02:01:06,290 --> 02:01:08,910
Bro, they're fucking walking like a squad.

2873
02:01:09,390 --> 02:01:11,090
It's like, Mr. President, get down.

2874
02:01:13,910 --> 02:01:15,750
Mr. President, get down.

2875
02:01:17,690 --> 02:01:18,650
What the heck?

2876
02:01:18,650 --> 02:01:19,670
Are they real people?

2877
02:01:21,890 --> 02:01:23,650
Are those real people?

2878
02:01:24,030 --> 02:01:24,250
Are those real people?

2879
02:01:24,250 --> 02:01:24,690
Like, what the?

2880
02:01:24,850 --> 02:01:26,270
They're so coordinated.

2881
02:01:27,150 --> 02:01:32,010
What if we say, like, right now, we're going to turn into, like, a very specific item, like a skull.

2882
02:01:32,510 --> 02:01:33,470
Right, and just don't want to do this.

2883
02:01:34,330 --> 02:01:36,210
I think I want to turn into...

2884
02:01:36,930 --> 02:01:39,230
Yeah, a skull probably would be the easiest.

2885
02:01:40,670 --> 02:01:42,290
Either the skull or, like, the...

2886
02:01:42,890 --> 02:01:44,130
There was another small one they mentioned.

2887
02:01:44,810 --> 02:01:45,250
Candles?

2888
02:01:46,150 --> 02:01:46,850
Yeah, candles.

2889
02:01:47,170 --> 02:01:48,450
There's chairs, too.

2890
02:01:48,450 --> 02:01:50,330
I haven't seen a lot of chairs here, though.

2891
02:01:51,950 --> 02:01:52,550
It's like...

2892
02:01:53,370 --> 02:01:56,290
Yeah, I mean, I was looking at the... those chairs over there are, like, sort of big.

2893
02:01:56,470 --> 02:01:57,710
Like, the ones in the kitchen.

2894
02:01:57,790 --> 02:01:58,270
Like, those are massive.

2895
02:01:59,070 --> 02:01:59,370
Yeah.

2896
02:01:59,370 --> 02:02:02,470
I wonder what would be, like, the best spot to, like, hide.

2897
02:02:03,910 --> 02:02:04,310
I'm just...

2898
02:02:04,310 --> 02:02:05,830
I wonder what the tasks are.

2899
02:02:06,010 --> 02:02:08,890
I hope they're, like, not... I hope the tasks are, like, somewhat easy.

2900
02:02:09,110 --> 02:02:10,110
Yeah, that's what I'm thinking.

2901
02:02:10,230 --> 02:02:12,690
I mean, four tasks in ten minutes has got to be easier.

2902
02:02:12,870 --> 02:02:15,530
Yeah, but then I'm, like, wondering if they're going to be, like, divided into different rooms.

2903
02:02:15,630 --> 02:02:19,890
You're going to see, like, props running around everywhere trying to get to various rooms.

2904
02:02:20,330 --> 02:02:20,650
Yeah.

2905
02:02:20,790 --> 02:02:25,070
It's also going to be, like, because there's three different types of monsters with different powers, but we don't know what that is.

2906
02:02:25,130 --> 02:02:25,410
Yeah.

2907
02:02:25,830 --> 02:02:30,910
Like, if there's one that just has, like, a sensor there's a monster in the room, you just stay AFK in that room for a minute and wait for them to move.

2908
02:02:31,310 --> 02:02:33,370
I think it could be one that gives you, like, a speed boost.

2909
02:02:33,730 --> 02:02:35,850
One that maybe helps you find props that are hidden.

2910
02:02:36,150 --> 02:02:38,930
And one that... I don't know what the third one could be, but...

2911
02:02:40,430 --> 02:02:42,410
Maybe, like, a range ability or some kind.

2912
02:02:43,150 --> 02:02:43,470
Cool.

2913
02:02:44,410 --> 02:02:45,210
Oh my gosh.

2914
02:02:45,270 --> 02:02:46,630
Finally the timer started!

2915
02:02:49,530 --> 02:02:49,930
Yay!

2916
02:02:54,640 --> 02:02:56,900
And then on the... like, let's say you're in a tie.

2917
02:02:58,080 --> 02:02:59,340
It's a free-for-all deathmatch.

2918
02:02:59,540 --> 02:03:01,900
So you just, like, want to be with your ally if you have any in there.

2919
02:03:02,240 --> 02:03:02,640
Yeah.

2920
02:03:05,500 --> 02:03:09,940
Wouldn't the tiebreaker be only one person survive out of everybody?

2921
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:12,760
Well, like, the bottom 30 people.

2922
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:17,160
So, like, let's say multiple people have the same amount of points in the bottom 30.

2923
02:03:19,100 --> 02:03:20,520
It's like, I think we'll see a tiebreaker.

2924
02:03:20,660 --> 02:03:21,120
I'm not gonna lie.

2925
02:03:22,420 --> 02:03:22,780
Yeah.

2926
02:03:25,700 --> 02:03:26,380
I'm gonna...

2927
02:03:27,180 --> 02:03:28,220
I'm gonna get knocked out.

2928
02:03:29,020 --> 02:03:30,020
I'm gonna get knocked out.

2929
02:03:30,880 --> 02:03:31,400
Parkour time.

2930
02:03:31,840 --> 02:03:32,180
Parkour time.

2931
02:03:32,180 --> 02:03:32,760
Oh my god.

2932
02:03:32,920 --> 02:03:34,180
This is not RNG.

2933
02:03:34,240 --> 02:03:35,940
This is actually tryhard time.

2934
02:03:36,740 --> 02:03:37,280
Yeah, right?

2935
02:03:39,060 --> 02:03:39,900
This is not fair.

2936
02:03:41,680 --> 02:03:43,060
What happened to the RNG?

2937
02:03:43,060 --> 02:03:43,340
What happened to the RNG?

2938
02:03:46,060 --> 02:03:46,420
Yeah.

2939
02:03:46,640 --> 02:03:48,240
We made it this far, guys.

2940
02:03:48,500 --> 02:03:49,880
We made it to Day 3.

2941
02:03:50,800 --> 02:03:52,600
Nah, we gotta be Day 5 Warlord.

2942
02:03:52,720 --> 02:03:53,640
All four of us.

2943
02:03:53,980 --> 02:03:55,760
All four of us?

2944
02:03:55,840 --> 02:03:55,980
Okay.

2945
02:03:56,200 --> 02:03:58,500
I don't know what kind of copium you have.

2946
02:03:58,680 --> 02:04:01,160
Guys, if you guys win, give me $1,000, please.

2947
02:04:02,560 --> 02:04:02,920
Please.

2948
02:04:04,560 --> 02:04:05,640
I'll say it right here, right now.

2949
02:04:05,720 --> 02:04:06,480
I'll be shameless.

2950
02:04:06,640 --> 02:04:07,500
I want $1,000.

2951
02:04:07,920 --> 02:04:08,940
Only if you do the same.

2952
02:04:10,100 --> 02:04:10,820
Okay, fine.

2953
02:04:10,960 --> 02:04:11,300
I will.

2954
02:04:11,420 --> 02:04:12,180
I will, actually.

2955
02:04:13,060 --> 02:04:13,480
I promise.

2956
02:04:14,280 --> 02:04:17,840
I'll give you guys points if... Wait, no.

2957
02:04:17,860 --> 02:04:18,320
That's colluding.

2958
02:04:18,460 --> 02:04:20,260
I was gonna say, I'll give you guys points if you split the money.

2959
02:04:21,060 --> 02:04:21,440
Okay.

2960
02:04:24,420 --> 02:04:27,520
If you guys make it to the top 20...

2961
02:04:27,520 --> 02:04:28,580
If you guys make it...

2962
02:04:28,580 --> 02:04:30,920
I'll give you guys points if you guys split your cash earnings.

2963
02:04:31,600 --> 02:04:33,280
If you make it to the top 20.

2964
02:04:35,260 --> 02:04:35,640
Shining.

2965
02:04:35,640 --> 02:04:36,020
Shining.

2966
02:04:36,360 --> 02:04:36,740
Look.

2967
02:04:40,040 --> 02:04:41,060
Oh my god.

2968
02:04:41,620 --> 02:04:42,320
Here we go.

2969
02:04:43,060 --> 02:04:44,120
You want me to get the video?

2970
02:04:44,460 --> 02:04:44,900
Oh, I'm hunted.

2971
02:04:45,040 --> 02:04:45,420
I'm hunted.

2972
02:04:45,480 --> 02:04:46,440
Oh, I'm hunted.

2973
02:04:48,680 --> 02:04:49,340
I'm hunted.

2974
02:04:49,500 --> 02:04:50,380
Die, die, die.

2975
02:04:50,700 --> 02:04:51,260
Help.

2976
02:04:51,440 --> 02:04:56,160
Guys, we're waiting to start.

2977
02:04:56,180 --> 02:04:57,640
We're still waiting?

2978
02:04:58,160 --> 02:04:59,760
There's more rules?

2979
02:05:03,400 --> 02:05:06,760
They posted more rules.

2980
02:05:07,180 --> 02:05:09,460
How are there more rules?

2981
02:05:10,240 --> 02:05:11,240
Bro, okay.

2982
02:05:11,580 --> 02:05:12,720
Give me a sec.

2983
02:05:12,820 --> 02:05:14,100
Let me read this.

2984
02:05:14,660 --> 02:05:15,140
Okay.

2985
02:05:16,880 --> 02:05:19,000
You don't lose points for doing any monsters.

2986
02:05:19,060 --> 02:05:20,920
Earn 5 points by killing props.

2987
02:05:21,440 --> 02:05:25,760
Do not get killed as a prop in any round unless you base on points by the end of round 4.

2988
02:05:27,180 --> 02:05:30,240
We will count steps taken for hunters.

2989
02:05:30,420 --> 02:05:30,860
What?

2990
02:05:31,200 --> 02:05:32,860
We count steps taken?

2991
02:05:36,200 --> 02:05:37,620
You will not spawn as...

2992
02:05:37,620 --> 02:05:38,720
You start as a hunter in round 1.

2993
02:05:38,800 --> 02:05:39,360
You will not...

2994
02:05:39,460 --> 02:05:39,840
Okay.

2995
02:05:40,180 --> 02:05:40,700
Alright.

2996
02:05:40,940 --> 02:05:42,540
I swear I registered this.

2997
02:05:44,880 --> 02:05:46,900
I was like, how is there more?

2998
02:05:49,420 --> 02:05:51,240
I was so surprised.

2999
02:05:51,620 --> 02:05:54,640
I was like, there's more to read?

3000
02:05:59,400 --> 02:06:00,820
I'm crouching up and down in the corner.

3001
02:06:02,180 --> 02:06:02,700
Okay.

3002
02:06:03,600 --> 02:06:04,500
What is this?

3003
02:06:05,600 --> 02:06:06,540
This is it.

3004
02:06:08,240 --> 02:06:09,280
This is it.

3005
02:06:09,460 --> 02:06:11,500
Guys, I feel like...

3006
02:06:11,500 --> 02:06:15,280
Guys, I feel like when I'm a hunter, I have to play in first person.

3007
02:06:15,520 --> 02:06:21,900
I think as a hunter, I would absolutely accidentally hit other things if I wasn't first person.

3008
02:06:22,860 --> 02:06:27,900
Because I don't play enough Minecraft to realize where the

3009
02:06:31,080 --> 02:06:31,720
hitboxes are.

3010
02:06:32,140 --> 02:06:33,560
Like, I'm so bad with hitboxes.

3011
02:06:34,280 --> 02:06:35,400
Where are the hunters?

3012
02:06:35,700 --> 02:06:36,560
That's what I think too.

3013
02:06:36,560 --> 02:06:37,220
Oh my god.

3014
02:06:39,220 --> 02:06:39,580
Oh.

3015
02:06:41,460 --> 02:06:44,000
Please show me the video of what the task is.

3016
02:06:45,720 --> 02:06:47,900
I wanna know what the task is.

3017
02:06:48,520 --> 02:06:51,940
Being a hunter first round is also great because you don't know the map and how it's playing out.

3018
02:06:52,580 --> 02:06:57,940
Me, personally, if I'm a runner, I'm gonna play and just get a feel for everything.

3019
02:06:58,640 --> 02:07:00,380
I'm gonna do my tasks and everything because those are high points.

3020
02:07:00,440 --> 02:07:03,220
I'm just gonna play passive and get a feel for how aggressive everything is.

3021
02:07:04,720 --> 02:07:05,260
Stealing intel.

3022
02:07:06,920 --> 02:07:07,960
Adjust and see.

3023
02:07:11,200 --> 02:07:12,460
Stealing strats right now.

3024
02:07:12,740 --> 02:07:15,400
It wouldn't matter anyway because I don't know what I'm doing.

3025
02:07:15,600 --> 02:07:17,440
I feel like these Minecraft players know more than me.

3026
02:07:20,340 --> 02:07:21,800
Thanks for the free intel.

3027
02:07:23,140 --> 02:07:23,580
Loser.

3028
02:07:24,140 --> 02:07:31,440
But not really a loser because they might have a chance from... they might have a chance of winning $70,000 because they play this game more.

3029
02:07:31,620 --> 02:07:32,180
But still.

3030
02:07:32,720 --> 02:07:34,460
Thanks for revealing your strats.

3031
02:07:40,800 --> 02:07:41,560
Yeah.

3032
02:07:43,080 --> 02:07:43,840
Yeah.

3033
02:07:43,940 --> 02:07:44,640
Alright, here we go.

3034
02:07:45,420 --> 02:07:46,880
We made it.

3035
02:07:47,100 --> 02:07:48,920
Wait, we all have one bar?

3036
02:07:49,820 --> 02:07:50,580
Woah!

3037
02:07:51,540 --> 02:07:52,240
Woah!

3038
02:07:52,540 --> 02:07:53,300
Woah!

3039
02:07:54,340 --> 02:07:54,720
Wait.

3040
02:07:55,340 --> 02:07:57,340
What the heck?

3041
02:07:59,120 --> 02:08:02,180
Someone's chat was like we all have one bar.

3042
02:08:02,960 --> 02:08:04,880
They kicked this out?

3043
02:08:04,880 --> 02:08:06,480
Oh, because...

3044
02:08:06,480 --> 02:08:08,120
That would be awkward.

3045
02:08:10,260 --> 02:08:13,160
Okay, now it's okay.

3046
02:08:13,600 --> 02:08:14,760
That was crazy.

3047
02:08:15,440 --> 02:08:21,080
Someone in the chat was like everybody has one bar and then we all got kicked out.

3048
02:08:22,400 --> 02:08:26,360
Guys, I think they started the server like on the opposite side of the world.

3049
02:08:27,680 --> 02:08:30,100
On the opposite side of NA.

3050
02:08:30,640 --> 02:08:31,780
I'm pretty sure.

3051
02:08:31,900 --> 02:08:32,620
NA and SA.

3052
02:08:33,560 --> 02:08:37,680
I think they started the server in like Japan or something.

3053
02:08:39,120 --> 02:08:41,240
Because why did all of us get one bar?

3054
02:08:41,380 --> 02:08:42,000
That was crazy.

3055
02:08:46,560 --> 02:08:47,940
They're going to fix the server.

3056
02:08:50,440 --> 02:08:52,560
Okay, they're going to move us again soon.

3057
02:08:54,920 --> 02:08:56,200
My heart, man.

3058
02:08:56,580 --> 02:08:59,440
This has been the most stressful rest week of my life.

3059
02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:01,480
Hey.

3060
02:09:02,640 --> 02:09:03,280
Made it.

3061
02:09:03,320 --> 02:09:03,680
Oh, Doki.

3062
02:09:04,020 --> 02:09:05,280
I got some bad news.

3063
02:09:05,460 --> 02:09:06,540
Yeah, what's the bad news?

3064
02:09:06,920 --> 02:09:08,880
We all discussed it.

3065
02:09:08,900 --> 02:09:10,240
We're going to target you.

3066
02:09:10,480 --> 02:09:11,100
Wait, what?

3067
02:09:11,260 --> 02:09:11,660
Why me?

3068
02:09:12,720 --> 02:09:15,380
Yeah, I'm not going to but they all want to.

3069
02:09:15,520 --> 02:09:15,920
Wait, what?

3070
02:09:15,920 --> 02:09:16,480
What did I do?

3071
02:09:17,480 --> 02:09:18,720
They just want you out.

3072
02:09:18,940 --> 02:09:19,060
What?

3073
02:09:20,220 --> 02:09:24,240
Apparently you're too good and Gumi said she was gunning for you.

3074
02:09:24,480 --> 02:09:25,680
Okay, now I know you're lying.

3075
02:09:25,760 --> 02:09:27,000
Gumi would never throw me out.

3076
02:09:27,100 --> 02:09:27,660
You're lying.

3077
02:09:28,140 --> 02:09:29,220
We have a pact.

3078
02:09:29,380 --> 02:09:30,140
Gumi would never.

3079
02:09:30,280 --> 02:09:30,880
Oh my god.

3080
02:09:31,120 --> 02:09:32,100
I'm telling Gumi this.

3081
02:09:32,160 --> 02:09:33,260
I'm telling Gumi this.

3082
02:09:33,300 --> 02:09:33,420
It's true.

3083
02:09:33,680 --> 02:09:33,740
It's true.

3084
02:09:33,760 --> 02:09:34,000
It's true.

3085
02:09:34,020 --> 02:09:34,420
It's true.

3086
02:09:37,320 --> 02:09:38,480
Where is Gumi?

3087
02:09:38,740 --> 02:09:39,300
Where is Gumi?

3088
02:09:39,300 --> 02:09:40,140
Gumi would never.

3089
02:09:40,420 --> 02:09:43,240
She would never wrap me up.

3090
02:09:45,380 --> 02:09:47,580
Gumi would never do such a thing.

3091
02:09:47,980 --> 02:09:49,000
Wait, where is she?

3092
02:09:50,460 --> 02:09:51,940
I gotta buy an account.

3093
02:09:52,640 --> 02:09:52,920
What?

3094
02:09:54,120 --> 02:09:56,480
Someone said I gotta buy an account.

3095
02:10:00,440 --> 02:10:01,880
Are you going to win?

3096
02:10:01,880 --> 02:10:03,760
Alright, where is she?

3097
02:10:04,480 --> 02:10:06,000
I'm gonna ride him out.

3098
02:10:06,840 --> 02:10:07,720
It's over.

3099
02:10:08,480 --> 02:10:09,920
It's over for him.

3100
02:10:12,360 --> 02:10:13,520
Gumi would never.

3101
02:10:13,820 --> 02:10:16,000
She would never do such a thing to me.

3102
02:10:18,340 --> 02:10:20,660
Also, like, how do you target people anyway?

3103
02:10:22,200 --> 02:10:24,320
Like, you can't even see any.

3104
02:10:24,600 --> 02:10:26,480
You're literally a prop.

3105
02:10:29,780 --> 02:10:30,760
That's messed up.

3106
02:10:31,880 --> 02:10:32,480
That's messed up.

3107
02:10:32,560 --> 02:10:33,780
That breaks rule 33.

3108
02:10:34,700 --> 02:10:35,980
No neg...

3109
02:10:35,980 --> 02:10:37,940
No negative behavior.

3110
02:10:44,360 --> 02:10:46,660
That breaks rule 33.

3111
02:10:48,220 --> 02:10:50,360
This has to be a positive...

3112
02:10:50,360 --> 02:10:50,620
Oh, wait.

3113
02:10:50,660 --> 02:10:53,800
I broke rule 33 when I was on the main broadcast.

3114
02:10:57,760 --> 02:10:58,400
Whoops.

3115
02:10:58,400 --> 02:10:59,040
Oopsie.

3116
02:10:59,980 --> 02:11:00,820
It's okay.

3117
02:11:00,920 --> 02:11:01,860
It was in...

3118
02:11:02,720 --> 02:11:04,060
It was like...

3119
02:11:04,060 --> 02:11:07,220
like a positive thing that happened there.

3120
02:11:07,840 --> 02:11:09,060
Where is she?

3121
02:11:09,780 --> 02:11:11,160
I don't know where she is.

3122
02:11:13,320 --> 02:11:14,500
Where did she go?

3123
02:11:15,880 --> 02:11:17,020
That was actually crazy.

3124
02:11:17,100 --> 02:11:20,060
I realized a lot of Minecraft players died during the first game.

3125
02:11:20,800 --> 02:11:23,060
Which is insane to think about for me.

3126
02:11:24,280 --> 02:11:25,220
I don't know.

3127
02:11:25,740 --> 02:11:31,600
I actually think it's like actually crazy that I lived longer than a lot of like...

3128
02:11:32,260 --> 02:11:32,700
uh...

3129
02:11:33,640 --> 02:11:36,320
a lot of the well-known Minecraft players in this game.

3130
02:11:36,680 --> 02:11:38,820
Yeah, respawn hunters should not get points.

3131
02:11:38,940 --> 02:11:39,740
That's just how it should go.

3132
02:11:40,180 --> 02:11:40,620
Yeah.

3133
02:11:40,760 --> 02:11:42,400
Oh, they're angry about the rules.

3134
02:11:43,400 --> 02:11:44,580
They're angry about the rules.

3135
02:11:49,100 --> 02:11:49,980
They're angry.

3136
02:11:51,840 --> 02:11:52,280
They're angry.

3137
02:11:53,260 --> 02:11:53,860
They're angry.

3138
02:11:53,960 --> 02:11:54,220
They're angry.

3139
02:11:54,220 --> 02:11:54,420
They're angry.

3140
02:11:54,540 --> 02:11:59,880
They're angry.

3141
02:11:59,880 --> 02:12:02,660
There is things that need to be done.

3142
02:12:03,920 --> 02:12:04,780
It's a little silly.

3143
02:12:05,320 --> 02:12:06,180
There's like...

3144
02:12:07,920 --> 02:12:10,660
It's definitely like speed running and then dying.

3145
02:12:10,860 --> 02:12:14,400
It's just depending on like how hard the tasks are.

3146
02:12:14,600 --> 02:12:15,660
And if you're able to do them all.

3147
02:12:15,760 --> 02:12:16,240
Yeah.

3148
02:12:18,480 --> 02:12:19,600
A lot of question marks.

3149
02:12:19,740 --> 02:12:24,440
I think the cinematic will give a few of those questions answers, but...

3150
02:12:24,440 --> 02:12:25,700
Yeah, that's the thing.

3151
02:12:25,760 --> 02:12:29,640
I think some people are tweaking about the rules, but I feel like the cinematic will make it so much more simpler.

3152
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:31,580
It also depends on the power of the monster.

3153
02:12:32,400 --> 02:12:32,800
Yep.

3154
02:12:34,420 --> 02:12:35,500
Oh my god, I'm listening.

3155
02:12:35,700 --> 02:12:36,640
I'm seeing the strats.

3156
02:12:37,100 --> 02:12:37,820
Oh my god.

3157
02:12:38,800 --> 02:12:40,120
I hear people complaining.

3158
02:12:41,720 --> 02:12:43,420
And I gotta steal the strats.

3159
02:12:43,440 --> 02:12:43,820
Oh, big time.

3160
02:12:43,920 --> 02:12:44,380
Big time.

3161
02:12:44,380 --> 02:12:46,220
I gotta steal the strats from the speed runners.

3162
02:12:48,800 --> 02:12:51,540
From the Minecraft speed runners gamers.

3163
02:12:54,520 --> 02:12:55,380
You're my sunflower.

3164
02:12:56,860 --> 02:12:58,600
Momon makes it so...

3165
02:12:58,600 --> 02:13:00,920
Oh, is that the remaining Spanish players?

3166
02:13:01,120 --> 02:13:01,720
Is that it?

3167
02:13:02,200 --> 02:13:03,940
I thought there was more.

3168
02:13:04,060 --> 02:13:04,920
There must be more.

3169
02:13:05,320 --> 02:13:06,320
I'm pretty sure.

3170
02:13:09,140 --> 02:13:09,960
You know what?

3171
02:13:09,960 --> 02:13:10,880
There's 80 of us.

3172
02:13:11,180 --> 02:13:13,540
They must have been separated into other groups.

3173
02:13:15,140 --> 02:13:19,880
I'm just trying to find Gumi so I can rat bad boy out.

3174
02:13:20,460 --> 02:13:21,600
Can't believe it.

3175
02:13:21,740 --> 02:13:27,600
I almost believed him until he said Gumi threw me under the bus.

3176
02:13:28,100 --> 02:13:33,400
After everything she did, there was no way she would throw me under the bus.

3177
02:13:34,620 --> 02:13:42,440
She already wasted so much time, like, dragging me through the finish line for so many days.

3178
02:13:42,640 --> 02:13:44,340
Why stop now?

3179
02:13:48,600 --> 02:13:51,300
She dragged me to the finish line.

3180
02:13:51,620 --> 02:13:54,020
So why would she stop now?

3181
02:13:56,220 --> 02:13:58,980
That's when I knew he was lying.

3182
02:14:02,980 --> 02:14:03,800
Oh my god.

3183
02:14:03,960 --> 02:14:05,080
Is she just AFK?

3184
02:14:05,580 --> 02:14:07,660
I don't even feel like I haven't bumped into her at all.

3185
02:14:09,480 --> 02:14:10,640
Guys, yay or nay?

3186
02:14:10,740 --> 02:14:11,640
Is she AFK?

3187
02:14:12,660 --> 02:14:15,440
Or is she actually moving around so that I couldn't...

3188
02:14:15,440 --> 02:14:17,620
I just barely missed her.

3189
02:14:17,700 --> 02:14:18,100
She's not?

3190
02:14:18,300 --> 02:14:18,580
Okay.

3191
02:14:20,500 --> 02:14:20,940
Okay.

3192
02:14:21,320 --> 02:14:22,200
I'm just unlucky.

3193
02:14:26,250 --> 02:14:27,710
Yeah, that's actually crazy.

3194
02:14:29,650 --> 02:14:31,330
Alright, let's try this just to do task.

3195
02:14:31,570 --> 02:14:32,170
I'm just unlucky.

3196
02:14:33,530 --> 02:14:34,450
What the heck?

3197
02:14:34,490 --> 02:14:35,730
Where could she have gone?

3198
02:14:39,880 --> 02:14:41,140
Wait, is that... no?

3199
02:14:41,580 --> 02:14:43,000
There's only two people outside.

3200
02:14:45,600 --> 02:14:46,580
Oh my god.

3201
02:14:46,620 --> 02:14:50,280
This is a harder hide and seek than the actual hide and seek game.

3202
02:14:54,400 --> 02:14:57,760
This is actually a harder hide and seek game.

3203
02:15:00,920 --> 02:15:02,900
Now I'm playing the real mini game.

3204
02:15:03,200 --> 02:15:03,900
Find Goomy.

3205
02:15:04,340 --> 02:15:07,500
For example, you know the TNT tag game that they played to get people out?

3206
02:15:07,880 --> 02:15:08,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3207
02:15:09,680 --> 02:15:11,340
Everyone could be running at the same speed.

3208
02:15:16,320 --> 02:15:18,820
Bro, that's what I thought for the game.

3209
02:15:19,040 --> 02:15:19,660
They weren't.

3210
02:15:20,560 --> 02:15:21,040
So...

3211
02:15:21,680 --> 02:15:22,160
Intel.

3212
02:15:32,720 --> 02:15:34,320
Just gotta be sneaky.

3213
02:15:35,800 --> 02:15:37,120
Just wanted the Intel.

3214
02:15:38,180 --> 02:15:38,920
You know what?

3215
02:15:38,940 --> 02:15:39,260
They're doing?

3216
02:15:39,580 --> 02:15:41,180
They're actual Minecraft players.

3217
02:15:42,680 --> 02:15:43,280
Wanted to know.

3218
02:15:49,340 --> 02:15:51,060
A minute and a half.

3219
02:15:51,280 --> 02:15:51,660
Jesus.

3220
02:15:52,160 --> 02:15:53,260
That's so long.

3221
02:15:54,640 --> 02:15:55,820
Are they on this side?

3222
02:15:59,670 --> 02:16:00,230
No.

3223
02:16:00,930 --> 02:16:01,490
Goomy!

3224
02:16:02,550 --> 02:16:02,830
Goomy!

3225
02:16:03,730 --> 02:16:04,290
Goomy!

3226
02:16:04,370 --> 02:16:06,750
You weren't throwing me under the bus, right?

3227
02:16:06,850 --> 02:16:07,230
Goomy?

3228
02:16:08,090 --> 02:16:10,030
How would I throw you under the bus?

3229
02:16:10,790 --> 02:16:14,570
Badboy was saying everybody was gonna throw me under the bus, including you.

3230
02:16:16,390 --> 02:16:18,070
But I didn't believe it.

3231
02:16:18,190 --> 02:16:20,710
I didn't believe it because I was like, Goomy would never.

3232
02:16:21,690 --> 02:16:22,690
I would never.

3233
02:16:23,090 --> 02:16:24,470
Not after how much...

3234
02:16:25,770 --> 02:16:26,830
That's what I said!

3235
02:16:27,110 --> 02:16:28,530
I was like, there's no way!

3236
02:16:29,090 --> 02:16:31,070
Goomy dragged me to the finish line.

3237
02:16:31,190 --> 02:16:32,650
Why would she throw me under now?

3238
02:16:36,150 --> 02:16:36,890
Badboy's a liar.

3239
02:16:36,970 --> 02:16:37,690
Don't trust him.

3240
02:16:37,690 --> 02:16:40,050
He tried to scare me.

3241
02:16:40,230 --> 02:16:41,670
He tried to tell me.

3242
02:16:41,950 --> 02:16:43,430
He's such a bad boy.

3243
02:16:46,790 --> 02:16:47,270
Badboys!

3244
02:16:49,250 --> 02:16:50,130
Oh my god.

3245
02:16:50,310 --> 02:16:51,710
I'm just looking for eggs though.

3246
02:16:51,730 --> 02:16:52,630
Because I feel like...

3247
02:16:52,630 --> 02:16:54,330
It takes so long.

3248
02:16:55,430 --> 02:16:57,250
Yeah, but it doesn't matter though.

3249
02:16:57,450 --> 02:16:58,230
The eggs do nothing.

3250
02:16:59,530 --> 02:17:00,490
You don't know that.

3251
02:17:00,550 --> 02:17:03,730
What if they give you 20 million subs if you get all of them first?

3252
02:17:04,110 --> 02:17:06,610
Okay, but you gotta live to the last day.

3253
02:17:07,050 --> 02:17:07,670
Okay, but you gotta live to the last day.

3254
02:17:07,690 --> 02:17:09,290
Nah, I'd win.

3255
02:17:09,570 --> 02:17:14,090
Because like, every day they add 10 more eggs, so...

3256
02:17:14,090 --> 02:17:15,290
Nah, I'd win.

3257
02:17:15,570 --> 02:17:17,790
What if they gift everyone 20 million?

3258
02:17:17,970 --> 02:17:19,150
Oh no, they can't be pleased.

3259
02:17:19,330 --> 02:17:21,110
And they paste in the traduction...

3260
02:17:21,110 --> 02:17:23,550
If they did that, then like...

3261
02:17:23,550 --> 02:17:25,290
Then like, I'd rather they just...

3262
02:17:26,130 --> 02:17:29,210
I'd rather they just split the 70k to the other days.

3263
02:17:29,450 --> 02:17:30,310
Instead of that.

3264
02:17:31,590 --> 02:17:32,830
No, I feel that too.

3265
02:17:36,090 --> 02:17:37,050
Is this...

3266
02:17:37,690 --> 02:17:38,810
Yeah, I found absolutely nothing.

3267
02:17:39,290 --> 02:17:41,030
You found 20 million eggs?

3268
02:17:41,150 --> 02:17:42,530
He's my friend, not your friend.

3269
02:17:42,530 --> 02:17:43,130
I have 28.

3270
02:17:43,610 --> 02:17:47,010
I heard that they like, activate the eggs late too, sometimes.

3271
02:17:47,330 --> 02:17:48,610
Say he that you're my friend.

3272
02:17:48,670 --> 02:17:50,190
Oh, I heard that too.

3273
02:17:50,390 --> 02:17:53,330
Yeah, yeah, because someone in the general chat like, activated the...

3274
02:17:53,330 --> 02:17:55,950
He said the final egg was activated after...

3275
02:17:55,950 --> 02:17:57,330
I'm a better friend than him.

3276
02:17:57,590 --> 02:17:59,210
After half the...

3277
02:17:59,210 --> 02:18:00,490
The day was over.

3278
02:18:01,350 --> 02:18:02,650
Yeah, that's so int.

3279
02:18:02,770 --> 02:18:04,830
That's so... That's messed up.

3280
02:18:04,890 --> 02:18:06,190
That's Ashley messed up.

3281
02:18:07,690 --> 02:18:08,610
Oh, here we go.

3282
02:18:11,550 --> 02:18:12,430
Here we go.

3283
02:18:14,630 --> 02:18:18,870
You know, if a non-Minecraft player makes it to day four, that's a goddamn win in my book.

3284
02:18:19,570 --> 02:18:21,570
Well, there's a lot of non-Minecraft players.

3285
02:18:21,570 --> 02:18:26,930
No, there is... You know damn well the majority of the players here that are live aren't Minecraft players.

3286
02:18:27,070 --> 02:18:29,630
The one that Red died to was like the fast one.

3287
02:18:29,710 --> 02:18:30,750
Like it was like super speed.

3288
02:18:30,890 --> 02:18:32,290
Like super fast or something.

3289
02:18:33,210 --> 02:18:34,590
So I guess that's like a thing.

3290
02:18:34,590 --> 02:18:35,550
Okay, I'm coming.

3291
02:18:38,510 --> 02:18:39,930
Did you ever hide in the...

3292
02:18:39,930 --> 02:18:42,410
No, because they were saying that they camped people.

3293
02:18:43,490 --> 02:18:44,290
Oh, I hid in one.

3294
02:18:44,450 --> 02:18:45,290
Wait, did it work?

3295
02:18:47,090 --> 02:18:49,330
Well, it was busy chasing someone else.

3296
02:18:49,510 --> 02:18:49,610
Oh.

3297
02:18:50,770 --> 02:18:56,090
I didn't hide because like people were saying that like the puppet was camping people outside.

3298
02:18:56,510 --> 02:18:56,650
Really?

3299
02:18:56,790 --> 02:18:57,530
Oh, that's scary.

3300
02:18:57,750 --> 02:18:58,930
Yeah, so then I didn't hide.

3301
02:18:59,050 --> 02:18:59,790
So I got scared.

3302
02:19:00,130 --> 02:19:00,510
Good luck.

3303
02:19:00,510 --> 02:19:01,970
Good luck, everybody.

3304
02:19:02,330 --> 02:19:03,130
Good luck.

3305
02:19:03,390 --> 02:19:05,050
If you see me, run into me as a prop.

3306
02:19:05,410 --> 02:19:05,990
I will.

3307
02:19:06,410 --> 02:19:07,250
Thank you.

3308
02:19:08,770 --> 02:19:09,290
Alright.

3309
02:19:09,470 --> 02:19:10,830
Let's go back in my house.

3310
02:19:10,870 --> 02:19:12,890
Alright, now we're not one by.

3311
02:19:13,690 --> 02:19:14,830
Oh, wait a minute.

3312
02:19:15,790 --> 02:19:17,330
We're not one by now.

3313
02:19:17,430 --> 02:19:20,730
Everybody to the other edge of the corner so you don't...

3314
02:19:20,730 --> 02:19:23,730
You can only start as a hunter one round.

3315
02:19:24,650 --> 02:19:25,870
Oh, good tech.

3316
02:19:26,230 --> 02:19:26,750
Interesting.

3317
02:19:27,210 --> 02:19:27,770
How do you know that?

3318
02:19:27,810 --> 02:19:29,730
And there's a two minute respawn.

3319
02:19:30,570 --> 02:19:31,570
It is.

3320
02:19:31,650 --> 02:19:32,610
It is.

3321
02:19:32,610 --> 02:19:33,710
Yeah, read general chat.

3322
02:19:34,070 --> 02:19:35,450
They gave a lot of tips.

3323
02:19:35,930 --> 02:19:36,930
Wait, what was the...

3324
02:19:36,930 --> 02:19:38,230
You can peek.

3325
02:19:38,450 --> 02:19:39,350
What do you think?

3326
02:19:40,690 --> 02:19:41,090
Um...

3327
02:19:41,090 --> 02:19:42,870
You are my friend.

3328
02:19:44,210 --> 02:19:46,810
Wow, he's a Naruto enjoyer?

3329
02:19:47,350 --> 02:19:48,290
You are...

3330
02:19:49,090 --> 02:19:50,630
I'm listening to the intel.

3331
02:19:51,030 --> 02:19:52,250
You are my friend.

3332
02:19:52,710 --> 02:19:54,370
I'm listening to the intel.

3333
02:19:54,810 --> 02:19:55,350
Yeah.

3334
02:19:55,910 --> 02:19:57,630
I don't know the lyrics.

3335
02:19:58,950 --> 02:20:00,290
We've been in emote mode.

3336
02:20:00,510 --> 02:20:02,050
For like years now.

3337
02:20:04,070 --> 02:20:06,370
Only two hours have passed.

3338
02:20:06,370 --> 02:20:06,810
I swear.

3339
02:20:06,950 --> 02:20:07,730
I feel like...

3340
02:20:08,290 --> 02:20:10,450
I feel like I've been trapped in this purgatory.

3341
02:20:10,510 --> 02:20:11,810
For like eight years.

3342
02:20:12,110 --> 02:20:13,310
Since day one.

3343
02:20:13,790 --> 02:20:18,170
Since day one I've been in purgatory.

3344
02:20:20,210 --> 02:20:21,770
For eight years.

3345
02:20:23,530 --> 02:20:25,350
And it's not gonna be me.

3346
02:20:25,610 --> 02:20:26,630
I love Minecraft.

3347
02:20:26,630 --> 02:20:27,050
I...

3348
02:20:27,050 --> 02:20:29,390
I love Minecraft!

3349
02:20:36,910 --> 02:20:38,910
Right, voice chat will be...

3350
02:20:38,910 --> 02:20:41,150
voice chat will be gone soon, guys.

3351
02:20:42,930 --> 02:20:43,550
Yeah.

3352
02:20:46,910 --> 02:20:48,430
I feel like...

3353
02:20:48,430 --> 02:20:51,070
I feel like one of those like pets.

3354
02:20:51,530 --> 02:20:56,430
that have their life span extended I've been extended for like way too long.

3355
02:20:56,550 --> 02:20:57,610
You know what I mean?

3356
02:20:57,670 --> 02:21:04,550
By like ultra rich like owners and they extend their pets lifespan to like...

3357
02:21:07,090 --> 02:21:11,130
Longer than they should have been alive in this event.

3358
02:21:11,490 --> 02:21:13,010
And Gumi's the owner.

3359
02:21:13,230 --> 02:21:16,710
Gumi has extended my lifespan to the point where like...

3360
02:21:16,710 --> 02:21:19,030
It should not be possible for me to be here.

3361
02:21:22,870 --> 02:21:27,730
I should not... I'm like blind in both eyes like crawling right now.

3362
02:21:28,050 --> 02:21:29,450
I need to wear a diaper.

3363
02:21:29,590 --> 02:21:30,210
I'm like please.

3364
02:21:33,030 --> 02:21:35,990
I can't... am I still... am I still alive?

3365
02:21:39,890 --> 02:21:40,450
What?

3366
02:21:45,730 --> 02:21:46,970
Keep the respawn timer.

3367
02:21:46,970 --> 02:21:48,450
No that's if you die as a hunter.

3368
02:21:49,570 --> 02:21:49,970
Oh!

3369
02:21:49,990 --> 02:21:50,430
I see.

3370
02:21:50,830 --> 02:21:51,590
Rob to hunter.

3371
02:21:51,690 --> 02:21:52,010
Yes!

3372
02:21:52,090 --> 02:21:52,870
No problem, no problem.

3373
02:21:53,270 --> 02:21:53,870
It's reduced.

3374
02:21:53,990 --> 02:21:56,230
They said it was reduced like...

3375
02:21:56,230 --> 02:21:57,490
Rob turning to a hunter.

3376
02:21:58,510 --> 02:21:58,910
Oh!

3377
02:22:00,570 --> 02:22:01,470
That's messed up.

3378
02:22:02,370 --> 02:22:03,230
That is crazy.

3379
02:22:03,290 --> 02:22:03,810
Why can't he hear that?

3380
02:22:03,810 --> 02:22:06,110
I'll run into my first friend and look up to him and use a prop.

3381
02:22:06,910 --> 02:22:09,290
I know for a fact because I've read all this out loud.

3382
02:22:09,350 --> 02:22:09,910
Oh my god.

3383
02:22:09,950 --> 02:22:11,890
They said somewhere me and Wally noticed that.

3384
02:22:12,010 --> 02:22:12,230
Yeah.

3385
02:22:13,150 --> 02:22:14,490
You are my friend.

3386
02:22:15,390 --> 02:22:18,250
Where are like the non Minecraft players still alive?

3387
02:22:18,610 --> 02:22:19,010
It's like...

3388
02:22:19,030 --> 02:22:19,430
It's me.

3389
02:22:19,670 --> 02:22:20,310
It is.

3390
02:22:20,550 --> 02:22:22,790
We can't say Gumi because she plays a lot of Minecraft.

3391
02:22:23,110 --> 02:22:26,390
Like she plays exponentially a lot amount... large amount.

3392
02:22:26,550 --> 02:22:29,710
She's part of like at least two different Minecraft servers.

3393
02:22:30,510 --> 02:22:32,130
Like at least two.

3394
02:22:32,690 --> 02:22:33,130
Yeah.

3395
02:22:33,350 --> 02:22:33,950
Oh yeah.

3396
02:22:33,970 --> 02:22:34,910
You guys can't talk to me.

3397
02:22:34,990 --> 02:22:35,270
So yeah.

3398
02:22:35,330 --> 02:22:36,030
I don't even know.

3399
02:22:36,110 --> 02:22:36,830
I'm talking to myself.

3400
02:22:37,370 --> 02:22:41,390
I'm actually curious who's like not a Minecraft player that's still alive.

3401
02:22:41,650 --> 02:22:44,510
You get five points from finishing a task and you get five points per kill.

3402
02:22:44,530 --> 02:22:46,790
So the faster you become a hunter you know.

3403
02:22:47,150 --> 02:22:47,590
Yeah.

3404
02:22:47,830 --> 02:22:48,550
That's true.

3405
02:22:48,550 --> 02:22:54,290
I think it's when they said that everybody's doing it then like there's gonna be less people to kill anyway.

3406
02:22:54,410 --> 02:22:54,550
That's my problem.

3407
02:22:54,570 --> 02:22:56,370
So far what we've seen is very open.

3408
02:22:56,550 --> 02:22:59,450
But I assume past the corridors it'll be...

3409
02:22:59,450 --> 02:23:00,030
Can you approach for a second?

3410
02:23:00,030 --> 02:23:00,230
I don't know guys.

3411
02:23:00,270 --> 02:23:00,730
I'm scared.

3412
02:23:00,990 --> 02:23:02,110
Dude your ass is out.

3413
02:23:02,110 --> 02:23:02,810
I'm scared too.

3414
02:23:02,950 --> 02:23:03,230
Yeah.

3415
02:23:03,230 --> 02:23:03,290
Yeah.

3416
02:23:03,290 --> 02:23:03,310
Yeah.

3417
02:23:03,310 --> 02:23:03,370
Yeah.

3418
02:23:03,370 --> 02:23:03,490
Yeah.

3419
02:23:03,490 --> 02:23:03,610
Yeah.

3420
02:23:03,610 --> 02:23:03,670
Yeah.

3421
02:23:03,670 --> 02:23:03,890
Yeah.

3422
02:23:03,890 --> 02:23:04,210
Yeah.

3423
02:23:04,330 --> 02:23:04,630
Yeah.

3424
02:23:04,630 --> 02:23:05,090
Can you approach for three?

3425
02:23:05,090 --> 02:23:05,710
Last 30.

3426
02:23:05,930 --> 02:23:06,410
Okay I'm wrong.

3427
02:23:08,010 --> 02:23:08,410
Five minutes.

3428
02:23:08,650 --> 02:23:09,350
Another five?

3429
02:23:09,490 --> 02:23:11,430
I know we can't sing a song but can we make up a song together?

3430
02:23:11,610 --> 02:23:14,270
Yeah I'm associated with the normal hunter respawn period.

3431
02:23:14,310 --> 02:23:15,610
Uh I'm curious if that's right.

3432
02:23:16,150 --> 02:23:16,850
Oh wait.

3433
02:23:16,890 --> 02:23:19,010
Do we have to increase that on our own as well or?

3434
02:23:19,130 --> 02:23:21,950
See I feel like when we were singing the clapping hands song it was feeling good.

3435
02:23:22,130 --> 02:23:24,250
It was making my hair and teeth so dry like .

3436
02:23:25,070 --> 02:23:32,790
I don't know if I know but I think doing tasks and then dying quickly is actually moving us.

3437
02:23:32,890 --> 02:23:33,170
If you're happy in all the classes.

3438
02:23:33,170 --> 02:23:33,470
That was good.

3439
02:23:33,530 --> 02:23:33,750
Who did that?

3440
02:23:34,030 --> 02:23:34,430
Yeah.

3441
02:23:34,430 --> 02:23:34,610
The one you talked about.

3442
02:23:34,610 --> 02:23:34,790
Okay!

3443
02:23:34,990 --> 02:23:42,030
If you're happy and you know it, if you really want to show it, if you're happy and you know it, keep fighting for your plans.

3444
02:23:42,870 --> 02:23:45,630
I feel like we're trying to cope.

3445
02:23:46,330 --> 02:23:47,450
See, that made me feel better.

3446
02:23:47,490 --> 02:23:47,990
Anyone else?

3447
02:23:48,270 --> 02:23:49,090
I feel better.

3448
02:23:49,210 --> 02:23:49,770
I feel lighter.

3449
02:23:49,910 --> 02:23:50,810
I feel a little lighter.

3450
02:23:51,030 --> 02:23:53,210
I feel like we're inhaling some copium at the moment.

3451
02:23:53,790 --> 02:23:55,110
We're gaslighting each other.

3452
02:23:55,970 --> 02:23:55,990
It's not gone.

3453
02:23:56,010 --> 02:23:56,530
There's two left.

3454
02:23:57,110 --> 02:23:57,790
It's not gone.

3455
02:23:57,830 --> 02:23:59,230
Look, just remember this.

3456
02:23:59,270 --> 02:24:00,510
If you die...

3457
02:24:01,550 --> 02:24:03,450
In the game, you die in your life.

3458
02:24:03,450 --> 02:24:04,970
In real life!

3459
02:24:05,010 --> 02:24:05,530
Exactly!

3460
02:24:06,570 --> 02:24:08,050
Guys, I'm gonna die in real life.

3461
02:24:08,290 --> 02:24:10,990
Oh, I can't.

3462
02:24:10,990 --> 02:24:11,570
I can't.

3463
02:24:14,310 --> 02:24:16,730
I've... I've lived through enough.

3464
02:24:19,970 --> 02:24:21,550
Oh, thank God.

3465
02:24:25,360 --> 02:24:26,580
Wait, again?

3466
02:24:27,330 --> 02:24:29,300
I used... Oh my God!

3467
02:24:30,620 --> 02:24:32,800
Just eliminate me now!

3468
02:24:38,560 --> 02:24:41,180
Just... Just elim... Just take me out!

3469
02:24:42,020 --> 02:24:43,320
This is how to get you.

3470
02:24:45,460 --> 02:24:47,480
This is literally how to get you.

3471
02:24:49,620 --> 02:24:51,380
Just eliminate me now.

3472
02:24:58,180 --> 02:24:59,580
Oh my God.

3473
02:25:02,620 --> 02:25:04,120
You couldn't even reach the paintings.

3474
02:25:04,300 --> 02:25:05,560
Wait, do we need to render this?

3475
02:25:05,560 --> 02:25:06,820
You're too high in 10.

3476
02:25:07,400 --> 02:25:08,260
You're increasing.

3477
02:25:08,540 --> 02:25:09,320
You're not gonna lag.

3478
02:25:09,360 --> 02:25:10,800
And it's also... Just crank it.

3479
02:25:10,900 --> 02:25:13,300
You're not... You're not gonna lag, bro.

3480
02:25:13,540 --> 02:25:15,260
And just crank it down.

3481
02:25:15,580 --> 02:25:16,540
You died in the game.

3482
02:25:16,600 --> 02:25:17,820
You died in real life!

3483
02:25:18,200 --> 02:25:19,760
Oh my God.

3484
02:25:20,700 --> 02:25:21,220
Please.

3485
02:25:23,020 --> 02:25:25,180
I think this is psychological torture.

3486
02:25:29,040 --> 02:25:30,780
Trying to push us to our limit.

3487
02:25:32,200 --> 02:25:33,240
I refuse.

3488
02:25:33,240 --> 02:25:34,180
I don't know where you're going.

3489
02:25:34,900 --> 02:25:36,180
This is a squid game.

3490
02:25:36,300 --> 02:25:38,580
This is actually a squid game.

3491
02:25:38,780 --> 02:25:39,220
Hannah.

3492
02:25:41,000 --> 02:25:42,460
Did you see the...

3493
02:25:42,460 --> 02:25:43,320
This is a squid game IRL.

3494
02:25:43,500 --> 02:25:44,840
What's your strat gonna be?

3495
02:25:45,180 --> 02:25:46,280
This is a nice strat.

3496
02:25:46,280 --> 02:25:48,380
Yeah, it's nice, peace, and quiet.

3497
02:25:50,860 --> 02:25:53,200
I feel like this is real squid game.

3498
02:25:53,240 --> 02:25:54,740
This is psychological torture.

3499
02:25:55,000 --> 02:25:56,000
Well, I've been doing tasks for the past year, so...

3500
02:25:56,000 --> 02:25:58,380
I think that should be a good thing.

3501
02:25:58,460 --> 02:25:59,140
Yeah, tasks.

3502
02:25:59,680 --> 02:26:00,720
They bait us.

3503
02:26:00,780 --> 02:26:01,900
They put us in a room.

3504
02:26:02,040 --> 02:26:02,520
Hi.

3505
02:26:02,520 --> 02:26:03,400
That we got in.

3506
02:26:03,440 --> 02:26:04,380
Yeah, daily tasks.

3507
02:26:04,540 --> 02:26:06,080
And then they take us back to the lobby.

3508
02:26:06,300 --> 02:26:07,540
I want you to win the whole event.

3509
02:26:07,580 --> 02:26:08,940
To see who cracks first.

3510
02:26:09,360 --> 02:26:09,460
Yeah.

3511
02:26:09,900 --> 02:26:11,220
Am I allowed in this corner?

3512
02:26:11,240 --> 02:26:11,680
I will try.

3513
02:26:12,100 --> 02:26:13,160
I will try, Hannah.

3514
02:26:13,500 --> 02:26:14,400
Very good.

3515
02:26:14,600 --> 02:26:15,280
You said welcome.

3516
02:26:15,280 --> 02:26:15,960
Oh, thank you.

3517
02:26:16,260 --> 02:26:17,180
I'll do my best.

3518
02:26:17,180 --> 02:26:17,720
Hey, that was mean.

3519
02:26:18,780 --> 02:26:19,920
I want you to win.

3520
02:26:20,680 --> 02:26:22,000
Can't we share corners?

3521
02:26:22,420 --> 02:26:23,480
I can help you.

3522
02:26:24,020 --> 02:26:25,140
You can do it.

3523
02:26:25,180 --> 02:26:25,200
You can do it.

3524
02:26:25,220 --> 02:26:26,020
I believe in you.

3525
02:26:26,020 --> 02:26:27,160
Yeah, but we can share corners.

3526
02:26:27,620 --> 02:26:27,880
Precious space, guys.

3527
02:26:27,880 --> 02:26:28,080
Yeah.

3528
02:26:28,600 --> 02:26:31,300
I can share tips with you.

3529
02:26:31,820 --> 02:26:32,480
What's the tip?

3530
02:26:32,480 --> 02:26:33,120
Don't kill me.

3531
02:26:33,140 --> 02:26:33,560
You first.

3532
02:26:33,800 --> 02:26:34,160
Hey.

3533
02:26:34,740 --> 02:26:36,060
No, I got no tips.

3534
02:26:36,740 --> 02:26:38,840
No corner for you.

3535
02:26:39,380 --> 02:26:40,760
No corner for you.

3536
02:26:40,940 --> 02:26:41,840
Oh, my God.

3537
02:26:41,960 --> 02:26:42,780
Hey, my other side.

3538
02:26:43,300 --> 02:26:44,400
Hey, my friend.

3539
02:26:44,800 --> 02:26:45,240
Why?

3540
02:26:45,660 --> 02:26:47,120
This is too close to the lobby.

3541
02:26:47,240 --> 02:26:51,620
Man, I love how people are screaming because loud equals funny.

3542
02:26:51,720 --> 02:26:52,580
Loud equals funny.

3543
02:26:52,600 --> 02:26:53,440
Loud equals funny.

3544
02:26:53,660 --> 02:26:55,440
I'm going to be so loud to be so funny.

3545
02:26:55,560 --> 02:26:56,000
We will.

3546
02:26:56,000 --> 02:26:56,180
We will.

3547
02:26:56,180 --> 02:26:57,020
I'm going to make people laugh.

3548
02:26:57,020 --> 02:26:59,320
I'm going to make people laugh by being really loud real quick.

3549
02:26:59,600 --> 02:27:00,320
Yeah, do it.

3550
02:27:00,340 --> 02:27:00,500
Do it.

3551
02:27:00,500 --> 02:27:00,800
Scream.

3552
02:27:00,800 --> 02:27:01,900
Scream right now, Gumi.

3553
02:27:01,980 --> 02:27:02,320
Do it.

3554
02:27:02,340 --> 02:27:02,460
You're going to be so loud to be so funny.

3555
02:27:02,460 --> 02:27:02,920
Oh, man.

3556
02:27:03,120 --> 02:27:05,100
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3557
02:27:05,100 --> 02:27:05,900
Look, everyone's going to laugh.

3558
02:27:05,940 --> 02:27:06,060
What?

3559
02:27:06,220 --> 02:27:06,640
Ah!

3560
02:27:08,140 --> 02:27:08,600
.

3561
02:27:08,600 --> 02:27:08,740
.

3562
02:27:08,740 --> 02:27:08,980
.

3563
02:27:08,980 --> 02:27:09,300
.

3564
02:27:09,300 --> 02:27:09,700
.

3565
02:27:09,700 --> 02:27:09,720
.

3566
02:27:09,720 --> 02:27:10,000
.

3567
02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:10,680
.

3568
02:27:10,680 --> 02:27:12,180
The timing.

3569
02:27:17,720 --> 02:27:19,440
I don't want to hear you guys.

3570
02:27:20,020 --> 02:27:20,480
.

3571
02:27:21,680 --> 02:27:22,140
.

3572
02:27:22,740 --> 02:27:23,200
.

3573
02:27:23,200 --> 02:27:23,300
.

3574
02:27:23,300 --> 02:27:24,420
Silence!

3575
02:27:24,960 --> 02:27:25,960
Stop speaking Spanish!

3576
02:27:28,080 --> 02:27:30,240
That was a little man.

3577
02:27:46,000 --> 02:27:48,080
The grinning!

3578
02:28:01,980 --> 02:28:03,220
Heck the heck!

3579
02:28:23,300 --> 02:28:24,700
There's no like...

3580
02:28:25,180 --> 02:28:26,120
There's no attacks.

3581
02:28:53,300 --> 02:28:56,240
Two points for every five minutes they survive.

3582
02:28:57,360 --> 02:29:04,840
When being chased, hiders may lock doors behind them at a cost of two points for every locked door.

3583
02:29:06,540 --> 02:29:11,960
Additionally, hiders can earn five points for each puzzle they complete around the house.

3584
02:29:12,100 --> 02:29:12,840
What's a puzzle?

3585
02:29:13,480 --> 02:29:15,720
There are four types of puzzles.

3586
02:29:16,400 --> 02:29:22,040
One involves identifying things with eyes that do not belong to them.

3587
02:29:22,040 --> 02:29:28,320
Another requires using clues in the walls to unlock an ancient chest.

3588
02:29:28,420 --> 02:29:28,460
No!

3589
02:29:29,160 --> 02:29:33,700
Third, you must find a key to unlock the chest in the tower.

3590
02:29:34,080 --> 02:29:40,060
And the final puzzle type entails locating the witch's hex chest near some stairs.

3591
02:29:41,500 --> 02:29:42,280
No!

3592
02:29:45,240 --> 02:29:46,780
This is not...

3593
02:29:46,780 --> 02:29:48,320
This is a puzzle!

3594
02:29:48,960 --> 02:29:51,680
Why did we have these puzzles yesterday?

3595
02:29:54,280 --> 02:29:58,180
When a hider is eliminated by a hunter, they will...

3596
02:29:58,180 --> 02:29:59,340
This is an actual puzzle!

3597
02:30:00,300 --> 02:30:02,400
We had tasks yesterday!

3598
02:30:02,860 --> 02:30:04,980
Yesterday's task should have been today's task!

3599
02:30:05,280 --> 02:30:06,040
Because they will determine who survives.

3600
02:30:06,760 --> 02:30:12,540
To recap, hiders earn points by surviving and completing puzzles.

3601
02:30:13,140 --> 02:30:17,060
Hunters earn points by finding and eliminating hiders.

3602
02:30:20,060 --> 02:30:20,820
Goodbye.

3603
02:30:20,820 --> 02:30:21,200
Goodbye.

3604
02:30:22,700 --> 02:30:28,020
After each round, players at risk of elimination will be displayed.

3605
02:30:28,700 --> 02:30:36,100
In the final round, the 30 contestants with the lowest score will be eliminated.

3606
02:30:36,880 --> 02:30:37,640
I'm going to be right here.

3607
02:30:37,640 --> 02:30:38,680
This is where I'm going to...

3608
02:30:39,520 --> 02:30:40,580
Oh my god.

3609
02:30:47,380 --> 02:30:49,300
That's so dumb!

3610
02:30:50,820 --> 02:30:52,560
This is a puzzle!

3611
02:30:52,800 --> 02:30:54,120
These are puzzles!

3612
02:30:54,280 --> 02:30:55,140
These are tasks!

3613
02:30:59,320 --> 02:31:01,980
Now the actual puzzles!

3614
02:31:02,680 --> 02:31:03,360
No!

3615
02:31:03,700 --> 02:31:05,040
I cannot chat!

3616
02:31:05,180 --> 02:31:06,040
Help me!

3617
02:31:07,440 --> 02:31:08,440
No!

3618
02:31:10,040 --> 02:31:11,040
No!

3619
02:31:15,700 --> 02:31:16,200
Ah!

3620
02:31:19,600 --> 02:31:20,600
Chat!

3621
02:31:20,760 --> 02:31:20,800
Chat!

3622
02:31:20,800 --> 02:31:23,900
Chat can't even backseat me on puzzles!

3623
02:31:26,560 --> 02:31:28,600
I have to think for my own!

3624
02:31:29,460 --> 02:31:33,460
What's the point of being a streamer if we have to do our own thinking?

3625
02:31:38,400 --> 02:31:39,740
Wait, what the heck?

3626
02:31:40,380 --> 02:31:41,120
Welcome back.

3627
02:31:41,300 --> 02:31:42,880
Wait, everybody can talk?

3628
02:31:43,000 --> 02:31:43,300
I am.

3629
02:31:43,520 --> 02:31:44,080
Silence!

3630
02:31:44,520 --> 02:31:45,080
No.

3631
02:31:46,000 --> 02:31:46,480
No.

3632
02:31:46,840 --> 02:31:47,380
No.

3633
02:31:47,980 --> 02:31:48,540
No.

3634
02:31:49,420 --> 02:31:50,800
Bro, I was just talking about that.

3635
02:31:51,660 --> 02:31:52,200
I like you so much.

3636
02:31:53,480 --> 02:31:55,680
I almost remember the bears to die off the map.

3637
02:31:56,500 --> 02:31:56,860
Painting?

3638
02:31:56,860 --> 02:31:58,380
But then you're giving people free points.

3639
02:31:58,400 --> 02:32:00,720
If everyone does that, the round is going to end in like 25 seconds.

3640
02:32:01,060 --> 02:32:01,420
Oh jeez.

3641
02:32:01,580 --> 02:32:02,520
Well, keep from the chat.

3642
02:32:02,720 --> 02:32:03,180
Wait, what's this crap?

3643
02:32:03,180 --> 02:32:03,660
I was just feeling like it's fair.

3644
02:32:03,660 --> 02:32:04,900
Some of them seem pretty easy.

3645
02:32:05,000 --> 02:32:06,580
I think it's better to die early.

3646
02:32:06,680 --> 02:32:07,780
That seems hard.

3647
02:32:07,900 --> 02:32:08,380
That seems...

3648
02:32:08,380 --> 02:32:08,560
Oh!

3649
02:32:08,980 --> 02:32:09,440
Like late around?

3650
02:32:09,760 --> 02:32:11,360
I could go with the round that's not that bad.

3651
02:32:12,500 --> 02:32:14,660
Yo, the timer is longer than the first round, man.

3652
02:32:14,660 --> 02:32:16,340
So we're all just going to try to survive as we go?

3653
02:32:16,380 --> 02:32:16,840
Yeah, exactly.

3654
02:32:16,840 --> 02:32:18,920
So like if you're like up to the first round that means like...

3655
02:32:18,920 --> 02:32:18,980
Guys.

3656
02:32:18,980 --> 02:32:19,380
This is bad.

3657
02:32:19,940 --> 02:32:21,780
I have to think for myself guys.

3658
02:32:22,580 --> 02:32:23,540
Guys, this is bad.

3659
02:32:23,580 --> 02:32:24,320
Being a hunter the first round is probably the best on Twitter.

3660
02:32:24,320 --> 02:32:26,100
I'm supposed to be a puppet for my chat.

3661
02:32:26,220 --> 02:32:26,360
Yeah.

3662
02:32:26,800 --> 02:32:28,460
And regurgitate everything they tell me.

3663
02:32:28,560 --> 02:32:29,160
This is bad.

3664
02:32:29,260 --> 02:32:29,520
Oh yeah.

3665
02:32:29,520 --> 02:32:30,020
No it is.

3666
02:32:30,060 --> 02:32:33,480
I spent 4 years being a streamer to not think for myself.

3667
02:32:33,480 --> 02:32:34,380
Oh Mike, you don't want to be...

3668
02:32:34,380 --> 02:32:36,020
You want to get turned into a beast or what?

3669
02:32:36,100 --> 02:32:36,960
Not everyone seems to be a hunter.

3670
02:32:36,960 --> 02:32:38,660
To not do problem solving for myself.

3671
02:32:38,840 --> 02:32:39,180
I think...

3672
02:32:39,180 --> 02:32:40,800
I don't know if it's better to just die off the map and the first round.

3673
02:32:40,800 --> 02:32:41,800
Now, I have to use my brain.

3674
02:32:42,060 --> 02:32:43,940
Oh, that's a waste of time.

3675
02:32:43,940 --> 02:32:44,060
Guys.

3676
02:32:44,060 --> 02:32:46,220
It's not like riding a bicycle where I can just use my brain again.

3677
02:32:46,660 --> 02:32:47,620
Guys, it's not like that.

3678
02:32:47,900 --> 02:32:49,080
Guys, I'm really stupid.

3679
02:32:49,220 --> 02:32:50,000
I don't know if you guys know this.

3680
02:32:50,080 --> 02:32:50,920
I'm really, really stupid.

3681
02:32:56,040 --> 02:32:58,760
It's not like that, guys.

3682
02:32:59,880 --> 02:33:03,560
At this rate, 50% of my brain cells have been on vacation.

3683
02:33:03,840 --> 02:33:05,280
And they are not coming back.

3684
02:33:05,320 --> 02:33:06,720
They're still using their vacation aids.

3685
02:33:09,680 --> 02:33:11,640
Yeah, code for a chest.

3686
02:33:11,760 --> 02:33:13,020
Finding a key for a chest.

3687
02:33:13,020 --> 02:33:14,720
And then just finding something.

3688
02:33:15,340 --> 02:33:17,980
Yeah, and then find a hex chest behind stairs?

3689
02:33:18,360 --> 02:33:19,960
Yeah, find a hex chest on stairs.

3690
02:33:20,460 --> 02:33:24,020
Okay, but like for the code one, how do you think the code one works?

3691
02:33:24,780 --> 02:33:27,160
There will be codes randomly everywhere.

3692
02:33:28,040 --> 02:33:32,280
I wonder if the task will disappear after somebody finishes it.

3693
02:33:32,380 --> 02:33:33,360
There's no way, right?

3694
02:33:33,780 --> 02:33:35,440
If you just follow the horde again.

3695
02:33:35,660 --> 02:33:35,980
I don't know.

3696
02:33:36,780 --> 02:33:37,260
Alright.

3697
02:33:38,560 --> 02:33:41,040
We're going to win, you son of a bitch.

3698
02:33:41,640 --> 02:33:42,460
I'm not going to lie, I was just trying to tell him.

3699
02:33:43,020 --> 02:33:44,000
You can just hide from the ground.

3700
02:33:44,780 --> 02:33:45,980
Wait, how come they can?

3701
02:33:46,420 --> 02:33:48,820
Is it like, puta, a bad word?

3702
02:33:49,080 --> 02:33:50,200
Me or nay?

3703
02:33:50,500 --> 02:33:51,860
How do I know that word?

3704
02:33:53,220 --> 02:33:55,560
Wait, why can they swear in Spanish?

3705
02:33:56,160 --> 02:33:56,420
Really?

3706
02:33:56,980 --> 02:33:58,600
But like, we can't swear in English.

3707
02:33:59,560 --> 02:34:00,760
Yeah, but I think that's Spanish.

3708
02:34:03,400 --> 02:34:04,420
Wait a minute.

3709
02:34:04,940 --> 02:34:05,760
Yeah, it is active.

3710
02:34:06,160 --> 02:34:07,240
Yeah, well, I mean like...

3711
02:34:09,000 --> 02:34:09,940
I don't know.

3712
02:34:10,040 --> 02:34:12,160
I thought the green one that highlights...

3713
02:34:12,160 --> 02:34:12,280
Rocks?

3714
02:34:12,560 --> 02:34:12,880
Rocks?

3715
02:34:12,880 --> 02:34:13,180
I don't think so.

3716
02:34:14,800 --> 02:34:20,580
I was listening to the freaking cinematic!

3717
02:34:20,980 --> 02:34:21,940
You dumb people!

3718
02:34:26,500 --> 02:34:29,280
Sorry, I need to take my meds for like five seconds.

3719
02:34:31,080 --> 02:34:32,420
Well, now you can't turn into the props.

3720
02:34:32,560 --> 02:34:34,280
That prop won't seem to work for us, too.

3721
02:34:34,340 --> 02:34:34,660
Why?

3722
02:34:34,700 --> 02:34:35,160
Why is it?

3723
02:34:35,260 --> 02:34:35,360
Why?

3724
02:34:35,560 --> 02:34:37,860
Because if like, you're running past another prop, you're going to think it's fine.

3725
02:34:37,900 --> 02:34:38,840
You get free hits that way.

3726
02:34:38,860 --> 02:34:40,780
Actually, yeah, no, but you get them slowly and seriously.

3727
02:34:40,940 --> 02:34:41,500
They can't even run.

3728
02:34:41,860 --> 02:34:43,000
They have moon up out, actually.

3729
02:34:43,540 --> 02:34:44,300
I don't know.

3730
02:34:44,380 --> 02:34:44,800
Wait, what?

3731
02:34:44,840 --> 02:34:45,320
Say that again?

3732
02:34:45,600 --> 02:34:46,140
You can...

3733
02:34:46,140 --> 02:34:46,740
The prop one?

3734
02:34:46,960 --> 02:34:48,560
Imagine you're running past another prop.

3735
02:34:48,700 --> 02:34:49,900
You're going to be like, oh, that's chill.

3736
02:34:50,220 --> 02:34:50,800
But if it's a...

3737
02:34:50,800 --> 02:34:52,580
It could be a hunter.

3738
02:34:52,760 --> 02:34:53,420
So like...

3739
02:34:53,420 --> 02:34:54,000
You know what I mean?

3740
02:34:54,080 --> 02:34:56,220
If you see a prop running, you think there's a hunter behind them.

3741
02:34:56,600 --> 02:34:57,400
No, but like...

3742
02:34:57,800 --> 02:35:00,240
There's a hint that the hunter can be a prop.

3743
02:35:00,600 --> 02:35:01,280
No, I know.

3744
02:35:01,360 --> 02:35:03,260
But why as a prop?

3745
02:35:03,340 --> 02:35:04,420
Would you see a prop running?

3746
02:35:05,460 --> 02:35:07,420
Like, would you not think the hunter's behind them?

3747
02:35:07,780 --> 02:35:08,160
They're just looking for things.

3748
02:35:08,160 --> 02:35:09,040
No, they're just looking for things.

3749
02:35:09,100 --> 02:35:10,140
They could be looking to pass.

3750
02:35:10,280 --> 02:35:10,580
Yeah.

3751
02:35:10,840 --> 02:35:10,880
Okay.

3752
02:35:12,060 --> 02:35:13,340
Wait, do you know which one's for dice?

3753
02:35:13,440 --> 02:35:15,460
Do we think there's only one set of dice for the team?

3754
02:35:15,500 --> 02:35:16,720
Or do we think like there's only one set of dice?

3755
02:35:17,020 --> 02:35:17,360
There's three.

3756
02:35:17,800 --> 02:35:18,320
There's three.

3757
02:35:18,460 --> 02:35:19,600
And you need to do all three.

3758
02:35:20,180 --> 02:35:20,460
Yeah.

3759
02:35:20,480 --> 02:35:21,800
Do all three of what?

3760
02:35:21,920 --> 02:35:22,120
Okay.

3761
02:35:22,120 --> 02:35:24,240
You have to do all three of the tasks?

3762
02:35:24,300 --> 02:35:24,820
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3763
02:35:24,960 --> 02:35:25,020
I did.

3764
02:35:25,140 --> 02:35:25,680
Okay, yeah, yeah.

3765
02:35:25,760 --> 02:35:25,960
Yeah.

3766
02:35:26,700 --> 02:35:26,980
Yeah.

3767
02:35:40,940 --> 02:35:41,600
This is perfect.

3768
02:35:42,980 --> 02:35:47,580
Yeah, best bet is just to like figure out how to do them and then hopefully not die.

3769
02:35:49,380 --> 02:35:52,400
I also think it would be nice to be the hunter the first round just so you can see things.

3770
02:35:52,460 --> 02:35:52,940
I agree.

3771
02:35:53,420 --> 02:35:53,820
That's true.

3772
02:35:57,680 --> 02:35:59,460
Whoever starts as hunter gets huge advantage.

3773
02:35:59,640 --> 02:36:04,600
I just think it's crazy that like being a hunter all you need is five kills and then you get more points than any prop could get.

3774
02:36:04,620 --> 02:36:04,820
Yeah.

3775
02:36:04,980 --> 02:36:05,500
It's crazy.

3776
02:36:07,640 --> 02:36:09,520
Yeah, being hunter seems like an advantage.

3777
02:36:09,540 --> 02:36:10,860
It's literally like right beside the chest, I love it.

3778
02:36:12,660 --> 02:36:13,900
Oh, so it's that simple?

3779
02:36:14,040 --> 02:36:14,520
Yeah.

3780
02:36:15,320 --> 02:36:16,260
I hope so.

3781
02:36:16,360 --> 02:36:17,800
I feel like I should survive.

3782
02:36:18,060 --> 02:36:18,400
Well, good luck guys.

3783
02:36:18,680 --> 02:36:20,400
Let's see who comes out on the other side.

3784
02:36:20,920 --> 02:36:28,240
I feel like I should survive instead of doing tasks if you have to complete all three tasks to get five points.

3785
02:36:28,340 --> 02:36:29,140
It's not worth it.

3786
02:36:39,610 --> 02:36:40,090
Okay.

3787
02:36:55,170 --> 02:36:56,510
Maybe a skull.

3788
02:36:56,790 --> 02:36:59,030
Oh, I can't change into a prop.

3789
02:36:59,030 --> 02:37:00,210
I can't change into a prop for 12 seconds.

3790
02:37:02,110 --> 02:37:03,070
I don't know.

3791
02:37:04,470 --> 02:37:06,330
I want to be a...

3792
02:37:07,710 --> 02:37:09,450
Wait, can I get on top of here?

3793
02:37:10,030 --> 02:37:10,730
All right.

3794
02:37:12,890 --> 02:37:13,450
Okay.

3795
02:37:13,470 --> 02:37:13,970
That's dumb.

3796
02:37:16,270 --> 02:37:18,790
Like the timer is still starting.

3797
02:37:24,750 --> 02:37:25,950
How do I lock in?

3798
02:37:32,580 --> 02:37:33,620
This is scary.

3799
02:37:35,160 --> 02:37:36,240
Rotation locked.

3800
02:37:36,800 --> 02:37:37,360
Okay.

3801
02:37:37,860 --> 02:37:38,420
Okay.

3802
02:37:38,420 --> 02:37:38,940
Okay.

3803
02:37:38,960 --> 02:37:39,760
Oh.

3804
02:37:43,730 --> 02:37:45,170
Oh, I'm scared.

3805
02:37:50,620 --> 02:37:52,520
I don't know how to lock in.

3806
02:38:03,080 --> 02:38:04,660
Oh, rotation lock.

3807
02:38:04,700 --> 02:38:05,240
There you go.

3808
02:38:29,200 --> 02:38:29,760
Whoa.

3809
02:38:30,980 --> 02:38:31,540
Whoa.

3810
02:38:36,690 --> 02:38:37,250
Guys.

3811
02:38:37,370 --> 02:38:38,150
I want to know...

3812
02:38:38,150 --> 02:38:39,630
Is there like each point?

3813
02:38:41,130 --> 02:38:41,990
Each point has some kind of a lock.

3814
02:38:52,160 --> 02:38:55,460
Each point you get per

3815
02:38:59,030 --> 02:39:07,870
puzzle, or is it like you get points for completing all puzzles?

3816
02:39:08,830 --> 02:39:10,650
Can you guys let me know that?

3817
02:39:12,630 --> 02:39:18,710
Per puzzle, or is it all puzzles?

3818
02:39:18,890 --> 02:39:25,710
Okay, yay for per puzzle you get points, nay for you get points for all puzzles.

3819
02:39:31,700 --> 02:39:32,820
Oh, per puzzle?

3820
02:39:33,000 --> 02:39:34,720
Oh, so it does benefit doing puzzles.

3821
02:39:34,880 --> 02:39:35,380
Okay.

3822
02:39:37,140 --> 02:39:38,240
That's good to know.

3823
02:39:42,270 --> 02:39:44,570
Okay, we just gotta find stuff then.

3824
02:39:46,350 --> 02:39:48,870
Told you, some of these are so confusing.

3825
02:39:49,590 --> 02:39:51,650
We're supposed to get two points per two minutes.

3826
02:39:51,730 --> 02:39:52,210
We live.

3827
02:40:02,920 --> 02:40:03,640
I don't know.

3828
02:40:06,840 --> 02:40:07,880
Oh god.

3829
02:40:08,260 --> 02:40:08,980
Oh god.

3830
02:40:09,300 --> 02:40:10,000
Oh god.

3831
02:40:21,160 --> 02:40:23,060
I don't know where the puzzles are.

3832
02:40:24,860 --> 02:40:25,700
It's scary.

3833
02:40:26,480 --> 02:40:28,080
Do I even get any points?

3834
02:40:28,500 --> 02:40:31,280
Am I even getting anything?

3835
02:40:35,200 --> 02:40:36,960
It's a lot of monsters.

3836
02:40:45,110 --> 02:40:46,770
I have to move soon.

3837
02:40:47,550 --> 02:40:49,470
Please bypass me soon.

3838
02:40:49,910 --> 02:40:51,110
Oh, he's lagging.

3839
02:40:51,210 --> 02:40:51,530
No!

3840
02:40:56,070 --> 02:40:56,770
No!

3841
02:40:56,770 --> 02:40:57,630
Did he?

3842
02:40:57,750 --> 02:40:58,010
No!

3843
02:40:59,790 --> 02:41:02,190
He was lagging too!

3844
02:41:04,510 --> 02:41:06,890
Would I survive longer for two minutes?

3845
02:41:06,890 --> 02:41:10,850
Wait, let me check the points again.

3846
02:41:11,810 --> 02:41:15,590
Okay, survive for five minutes.

3847
02:41:15,730 --> 02:41:15,970
No!

3848
02:41:16,170 --> 02:41:18,510
I didn't survive for five minutes!

3849
02:41:20,130 --> 02:41:25,330
It was five minutes, not two!

3850
02:41:26,390 --> 02:41:27,930
I read it wrong!

3851
02:41:28,230 --> 02:41:31,550
It was five minutes, guys!

3852
02:41:34,050 --> 02:41:36,310
It wasn't two!

3853
02:41:41,530 --> 02:41:42,210
Goodbye.

3854
02:41:44,130 --> 02:41:46,470
I thought it said two minutes.

3855
02:41:46,650 --> 02:41:47,030
Bro!

3856
02:41:47,370 --> 02:41:50,590
Okay, it's like five paragraphs.

3857
02:41:50,890 --> 02:41:51,870
Not even paragraphs.

3858
02:41:52,410 --> 02:41:55,630
I swear, the rules are like a thousand words.

3859
02:41:56,570 --> 02:42:01,170
It's so hard to retain some of the information.

3860
02:42:03,290 --> 02:42:05,250
Bro, how did he know?

3861
02:42:05,390 --> 02:42:06,330
I locked it.

3862
02:42:06,550 --> 02:42:08,530
I locked my rotation.

3863
02:42:09,810 --> 02:42:14,190
Bro, okay, the worst part was he was lagging, so I got so confused.

3864
02:42:14,390 --> 02:42:16,330
I was like, is he walking past me?

3865
02:42:16,790 --> 02:42:21,810
I was like, is that man walking past me or is he trying to kill me?

3866
02:42:22,270 --> 02:42:24,130
He's so... he's lagging!

3867
02:42:27,530 --> 02:42:30,630
Like, why is he lagging as the monster?

3868
02:42:32,670 --> 02:42:33,190
Sad.

3869
02:42:33,670 --> 02:42:36,530
Okay, so per puzzle, you can get five.

3870
02:42:36,530 --> 02:42:37,930
You didn't get points.

3871
02:42:38,150 --> 02:42:42,430
They made it seem like you have to complete all tasks.

3872
02:42:42,890 --> 02:42:44,530
So I got confused with that rule.

3873
02:42:46,090 --> 02:42:46,570
Yay!

3874
02:42:48,270 --> 02:42:48,750
Yay!

3875
02:42:49,070 --> 02:42:51,790
Let me in, let me in, let me in, let me in, let me in.

3876
02:42:53,250 --> 02:42:53,730
Uh...

3877
02:42:56,250 --> 02:42:57,330
Oh, that's why!

3878
02:42:57,570 --> 02:42:59,830
Wait, that's actually bullshit!

3879
02:43:02,470 --> 02:43:04,610
It reveals a prop!

3880
02:43:04,610 --> 02:43:07,330
So that... I didn't know that!

3881
02:43:07,850 --> 02:43:10,570
We had no intel as to what they are!

3882
02:43:14,910 --> 02:43:16,130
Oh my god!

3883
02:43:16,170 --> 02:43:18,510
That's why I was like wondering, I was like, how did they find out?

3884
02:43:18,690 --> 02:43:19,910
Like, I was so confused.

3885
02:43:20,410 --> 02:43:22,190
Like, how did they find out?

3886
02:43:22,270 --> 02:43:25,110
I was... I was like a monster.

3887
02:43:28,270 --> 02:43:30,070
Wait, how do we...

3888
02:43:30,610 --> 02:43:31,010
Uh...

3889
02:43:31,570 --> 02:43:32,830
Bro, what the heck?

3890
02:43:34,610 --> 02:43:35,510
Here, fat...

3891
02:43:35,510 --> 02:43:37,250
Press F to reveal.

3892
02:43:37,870 --> 02:43:38,430
Okay.

3893
02:43:41,830 --> 02:43:43,970
Okay, I know like there's a lot of them.

3894
02:43:45,570 --> 02:43:46,670
There are no pro...

3895
02:43:46,670 --> 02:43:46,850
Yeah!

3896
02:43:47,070 --> 02:43:48,230
Oh my god!

3897
02:43:48,370 --> 02:43:50,010
So that's how...

3898
02:43:50,690 --> 02:43:52,490
That's actually messed up!

3899
02:43:52,510 --> 02:43:56,410
If I knew a monster had that ability, I would not just sit there.

3900
02:44:00,810 --> 02:44:04,630
I would 100% not just sit there!

3901
02:44:04,870 --> 02:44:06,930
That's actually so messed up!

3902
02:44:10,930 --> 02:44:13,170
Oh my god, that's so smart.

3903
02:44:14,230 --> 02:44:14,870
Jesus.

3904
02:44:14,990 --> 02:44:17,130
Wait, I don't remember the skull being there.

3905
02:44:17,790 --> 02:44:19,690
Actually, I don't remember in general.

3906
02:44:27,210 --> 02:44:29,790
I don't remember what the props were.

3907
02:44:32,610 --> 02:44:34,950
It's been so long already.

3908
02:44:35,090 --> 02:44:35,730
I already forgot.

3909
02:44:38,350 --> 02:44:39,430
Oh my god.

3910
02:44:39,810 --> 02:44:41,350
Are they actually still there?

3911
02:44:41,570 --> 02:44:42,790
Okay, they're not there then.

3912
02:44:42,970 --> 02:44:44,030
They're not there.

3913
02:44:44,090 --> 02:44:45,670
There's only one prop remaining?

3914
02:44:46,190 --> 02:44:47,110
Bro, what?

3915
02:44:49,770 --> 02:44:52,150
Oh my god.

3916
02:44:53,490 --> 02:44:55,290
Can't believe it!

3917
02:44:57,370 --> 02:45:03,550
This ability, the revealing probability was actually so messed up!

3918
02:45:03,750 --> 02:45:05,790
It was so messed up!

3919
02:45:06,410 --> 02:45:11,870
No wonder he knew I was just there.

3920
02:45:16,990 --> 02:45:18,190
Please wait.

3921
02:45:19,930 --> 02:45:21,570
Who has the most points?

3922
02:45:21,790 --> 02:45:22,770
Zero points?

3923
02:45:23,450 --> 02:45:24,810
Okay, zero points.

3924
02:45:24,810 --> 02:45:25,350
Hey, there's me.

3925
02:45:25,450 --> 02:45:25,990
Zero points.

3926
02:45:29,950 --> 02:45:30,850
That's me.

3927
02:45:31,990 --> 02:45:34,010
Wait, we all have zero points.

3928
02:45:35,010 --> 02:45:36,330
Oh my god.

3929
02:45:38,950 --> 02:45:39,990
Oh my god.

3930
02:45:42,050 --> 02:45:45,490
I feel like they should've told us what each hunter ability does.

3931
02:45:47,250 --> 02:45:53,830
Because like, if I knew that one of the hunters can literally see...

3932
02:45:56,030 --> 02:46:00,290
I can literally see what the prop...

3933
02:46:00,290 --> 02:46:02,010
I would not have just stood there.

3934
02:46:02,130 --> 02:46:03,670
I would've ran away.

3935
02:46:08,490 --> 02:46:09,710
Oh my god.

3936
02:46:09,890 --> 02:46:12,050
After seeing that, I'm like, what?

3937
02:46:13,570 --> 02:46:14,330
I was like, how?

3938
02:46:16,190 --> 02:46:18,510
I would've 100% just ran.

3939
02:46:19,430 --> 02:46:20,350
Oh my god.

3940
02:46:20,370 --> 02:46:22,650
Might as well just be a goddamn...

3941
02:46:24,050 --> 02:46:26,590
Being a hunter is just better.

3942
02:46:26,590 --> 02:46:28,430
There's like no reason.

3943
02:46:29,050 --> 02:46:29,850
I feel.

3944
02:46:30,410 --> 02:46:32,550
There's actually no reason to be a prop.

3945
02:46:33,430 --> 02:46:36,690
If I was a hunter I can just find people.

3946
02:46:38,170 --> 02:46:39,790
Do puzzles or something.

3947
02:46:44,040 --> 02:46:45,700
Let's all just be skulls.

3948
02:46:48,380 --> 02:46:51,780
Just just kill me now so I can find props.

3949
02:46:54,560 --> 02:46:59,680
Just kill me now in game so I can be a hunter.

3950
02:47:00,740 --> 02:47:02,280
It's just worth it.

3951
02:47:02,420 --> 02:47:03,480
Cards do puzzles.

3952
02:47:09,000 --> 02:47:11,360
There's no stuff here.

3953
02:47:15,660 --> 02:47:17,480
Where are some of the tasks.

3954
02:47:20,640 --> 02:47:21,740
Oh my god.

3955
02:47:23,060 --> 02:47:23,980
The thing is.

3956
02:47:24,040 --> 02:47:26,480
I feel like that's the— I feel like we're all- we all want to be hit by the hunter.

3957
02:47:28,500 --> 02:47:31,620
Like, the moment you get hunter, you just- it's like free.

3958
02:47:31,900 --> 02:47:32,340
Freelo.

3959
02:47:33,600 --> 02:47:34,040
IMO.

3960
02:47:35,720 --> 02:47:39,180
All of us is just trying to find, like, the puzzle and stuff.

3961
02:47:41,140 --> 02:47:41,800
Wait, no!

3962
02:47:42,020 --> 02:47:43,280
I want to be there!

3963
02:47:44,800 --> 02:47:45,500
I'm gonna die.

3964
02:47:46,080 --> 02:47:47,960
I'd rather- I don't know.

3965
02:47:48,740 --> 02:47:49,820
I'd rather just die.

3966
02:47:55,160 --> 02:47:56,120
There's no reason.

3967
02:47:56,860 --> 02:47:58,160
Oh my god.

3968
02:47:58,260 --> 02:48:00,040
I literally don't know where the puzzles are.

3969
02:48:00,820 --> 02:48:01,440
Hello?

3970
02:48:02,120 --> 02:48:02,740
Puzzles?

3971
02:48:03,940 --> 02:48:08,440
We're all just running around with, like, as if headless chickens.

3972
02:48:11,260 --> 02:48:13,900
We're all, like, headless chickens right now.

3973
02:48:14,000 --> 02:48:15,080
Just running around.

3974
02:48:15,360 --> 02:48:16,660
One is an actual chicken!

3975
02:48:18,460 --> 02:48:20,480
One of them is even a chicken themselves!

3976
02:48:25,080 --> 02:48:26,080
The eyes!

3977
02:48:26,280 --> 02:48:27,080
Where are the eyes?

3978
02:48:28,160 --> 02:48:29,640
Where are the goddamn eyes?

3979
02:48:31,820 --> 02:48:34,260
Bro, I've been moving for, like, 20 years.

3980
02:48:34,380 --> 02:48:35,280
You cannot say that.

3981
02:48:36,520 --> 02:48:38,460
Your location will be revealed.

3982
02:48:38,740 --> 02:48:39,320
I know!

3983
02:48:39,460 --> 02:48:41,200
I've been running for 20 years!

3984
02:48:41,440 --> 02:48:43,480
I know my location will be revealed!

3985
02:48:46,120 --> 02:48:46,640
Yes!

3986
02:48:49,340 --> 02:48:52,980
There's three- two out of three course paintings?!

3987
02:48:52,980 --> 02:48:59,140
I don't even get that point automatic- Oh, wait.

3988
02:49:02,960 --> 02:49:03,880
Oh my god.

3989
02:49:03,900 --> 02:49:07,940
The fact that I don't even get that point automatically is the worst part.

3990
02:49:09,040 --> 02:49:09,680
No!

3991
02:49:10,060 --> 02:49:10,700
No!

3992
02:49:11,040 --> 02:49:13,480
Please hit the candle and not me!

3993
02:49:14,060 --> 02:49:14,700
Please!

3994
02:49:15,020 --> 02:49:15,900
The candle!

3995
02:49:18,600 --> 02:49:19,240
Please!

3996
02:49:19,240 --> 02:49:20,360
The candle!

3997
02:49:20,900 --> 02:49:21,420
No!

3998
02:49:22,540 --> 02:49:24,300
I was so close!

3999
02:49:24,300 --> 02:49:24,620
Yes!

4000
02:49:27,280 --> 02:49:28,020
No!

4001
02:49:28,320 --> 02:49:29,620
I got two!

4002
02:49:29,860 --> 02:49:33,040
I couldn't find the last painting!

4003
02:49:34,340 --> 02:49:35,080
No!

4004
02:49:39,260 --> 02:49:40,000
No!

4005
02:49:45,320 --> 02:49:47,400
That was so close.

4006
02:49:47,720 --> 02:49:49,820
I almost juked them, too!

4007
02:49:50,340 --> 02:49:52,740
I almost juked them!

4008
02:49:54,560 --> 02:49:55,360
It's GG.

4009
02:49:55,560 --> 02:49:57,200
This- this game is hard.

4010
02:49:58,560 --> 02:50:03,560
I think it's really hard because, like, the puzzles are, like, so difficult.

4011
02:50:03,700 --> 02:50:08,140
And, like, when you're a hunter, you get more out of it as a hunter.

4012
02:50:08,560 --> 02:50:14,520
Like, it's so RNG to the fact that you get more points as a- when you- if you get RNG'd as a hunter.

4013
02:50:15,420 --> 02:50:17,120
Versus, like, being an object.

4014
02:50:17,400 --> 02:50:20,640
So it's already, like, skewed towards RNG for hunters.

4015
02:50:21,280 --> 02:50:21,760
Yeah.

4016
02:50:22,100 --> 02:50:25,000
Whoever gets, like, good RNG for that- basically...

4017
02:50:25,720 --> 02:50:26,580
gets points.

4018
02:50:27,800 --> 02:50:29,580
Because there's more props to kill, too.

4019
02:50:29,720 --> 02:50:31,100
There's a lot of props, too.

4020
02:50:31,160 --> 02:50:31,760
Running around.

4021
02:50:31,880 --> 02:50:32,980
And everybody's moving around.

4022
02:50:33,340 --> 02:50:35,200
Nobody wants to hide, I feel like.

4023
02:50:35,840 --> 02:50:37,580
Like, literally nobody wants to hide.

4024
02:50:37,700 --> 02:50:40,280
And then the fact that they have that power to...

4025
02:50:41,060 --> 02:50:41,940
see objects.

4026
02:50:42,300 --> 02:50:45,940
Like, literally see props is, like, messed up.

4027
02:50:46,960 --> 02:50:49,520
I think this should- this game definitely should have been balanced more.

4028
02:50:50,500 --> 02:50:54,380
This game definitely feels like it could- it needs a lot of balancing.

4029
02:50:54,680 --> 02:50:55,340
I feel.

4030
02:50:57,460 --> 02:51:00,440
I think they should remove the monster that could literally see props.

4031
02:51:01,260 --> 02:51:03,180
Because, like, we already have to move?

4032
02:51:03,540 --> 02:51:06,580
I think, like, because, like, IMO, we already have to move anyway.

4033
02:51:06,920 --> 02:51:10,660
So there's no reason for a monster to be able to have, like, the sight to see props.

4034
02:51:10,960 --> 02:51:11,820
If we're moving.

4035
02:51:11,960 --> 02:51:13,940
If we have one minute to move.

4036
02:51:15,160 --> 02:51:17,640
Like, I know, like, the cooldown's really hard.

4037
02:51:17,740 --> 02:51:18,840
Like, there's a huge cooldown.

4038
02:51:19,300 --> 02:51:20,820
But, like I said, we're already moving.

4039
02:51:21,020 --> 02:51:21,820
So it doesn't matter.

4040
02:51:21,820 --> 02:51:24,160
Like, it's just better to be the Grinner.

4041
02:51:27,040 --> 02:51:28,020
It's just easier.

4042
02:51:29,060 --> 02:51:30,920
Oh, there's 13 props remaining.

4043
02:51:34,260 --> 02:51:35,900
I know you're all running.

4044
02:51:36,100 --> 02:51:37,780
Because you want to do tasks.

4045
02:51:41,800 --> 02:51:43,100
Nobody's hiding anymore.

4046
02:51:43,360 --> 02:51:44,260
I know that.

4047
02:51:44,960 --> 02:51:47,120
I know none of you guys like to hide.

4048
02:51:49,960 --> 02:51:50,880
I know that.

4049
02:51:50,880 --> 02:51:52,460
None of you guys like to hide.

4050
02:51:55,850 --> 02:51:58,050
Yeah, this has been...

4051
02:51:58,050 --> 02:51:58,690
Whoa!

4052
02:51:59,310 --> 02:51:59,910
Wait.

4053
02:52:00,510 --> 02:52:01,530
This room has...

4054
02:52:01,530 --> 02:52:03,190
Wait, they don't change locations?

4055
02:52:03,250 --> 02:52:04,090
For rooms?

4056
02:52:09,740 --> 02:52:10,920
Wait a minute.

4057
02:52:12,000 --> 02:52:14,380
I feel like when you know what the puzzles are...

4058
02:52:14,380 --> 02:52:15,440
Wait, that's not fair!

4059
02:52:15,760 --> 02:52:17,140
The puzzles aren't locked.

4060
02:52:18,000 --> 02:52:18,820
I think.

4061
02:52:19,300 --> 02:52:21,260
I think, like, uh...

4062
02:52:21,260 --> 02:52:24,180
The puzzles aren't, like, locked to a specific location.

4063
02:52:26,980 --> 02:52:28,240
I feel like, right?

4064
02:52:29,760 --> 02:52:31,480
Because, like, why would...

4065
02:52:31,480 --> 02:52:32,400
Um...

4066
02:52:34,280 --> 02:52:34,760
Yeah.

4067
02:52:34,920 --> 02:52:38,700
So, like, I could just go there and unlock...

4068
02:52:38,700 --> 02:52:39,800
Wait, that's not fair!

4069
02:52:41,180 --> 02:52:42,660
We just, like, run...

4070
02:52:42,660 --> 02:52:43,280
Yeah!

4071
02:52:43,600 --> 02:52:44,260
Okay, guys.

4072
02:52:44,380 --> 02:52:46,800
The worst part is that I am directionally challenged.

4073
02:52:47,100 --> 02:52:49,500
So I don't really remember where the paintings are.

4074
02:52:52,000 --> 02:52:54,860
I guess we just gotta figure out where the paintings are again.

4075
02:52:55,160 --> 02:52:56,580
I guess we just gotta figure out where the paintings are again.

4076
02:52:56,580 --> 02:52:57,340
The puzzles...

4077
02:52:57,340 --> 02:53:00,580
The fact that the puzzles aren't locked specifically...

4078
02:53:00,580 --> 02:53:02,860
So, like, that's one of them.

4079
02:53:03,240 --> 02:53:04,200
Like, the intel.

4080
02:53:05,080 --> 02:53:06,840
This is the north rooms.

4081
02:53:07,740 --> 02:53:09,260
And I guess, like...

4082
02:53:10,800 --> 02:53:11,380
X...

4083
02:53:11,380 --> 02:53:12,220
Uh...

4084
02:53:12,880 --> 02:53:13,460
X...

4085
02:53:13,460 --> 02:53:14,560
X...

4086
02:53:14,560 --> 02:53:14,920
That?

4087
02:53:15,600 --> 02:53:16,180
Yeah.

4088
02:53:16,300 --> 02:53:17,420
So that's north room.

4089
02:53:17,500 --> 02:53:18,600
So that's one of the puzzles.

4090
02:53:20,620 --> 02:53:21,900
Wait, that's not fair!

4091
02:53:24,560 --> 02:53:25,920
Wait a minute.

4092
02:53:25,920 --> 02:53:27,800
Why don't they rotate that?

4093
02:53:29,500 --> 02:53:32,940
They should at least randomize the location.

4094
02:53:36,080 --> 02:53:39,140
I feel like they should randomize the locations for this.

4095
02:53:40,580 --> 02:53:41,140
Okay.

4096
02:53:43,520 --> 02:53:45,340
Where are the other paintings, though?

4097
02:53:49,060 --> 02:53:53,560
I feel like people will know where the paintings are better than me.

4098
02:53:53,820 --> 02:53:55,020
Because I found two.

4099
02:53:55,020 --> 02:53:56,800
But I don't know where the others are.

4100
02:53:57,220 --> 02:53:58,740
Where the other paintings are.

4101
02:54:00,760 --> 02:54:01,760
Oh my god.

4102
02:54:03,940 --> 02:54:05,380
Where's the last prop?

4103
02:54:05,780 --> 02:54:07,120
I didn't even get to see...

4104
02:54:07,120 --> 02:54:07,600
Okay, courtyard.

4105
02:54:08,560 --> 02:54:10,480
Courtyard takes us to this chest.

4106
02:54:11,460 --> 02:54:13,520
I mean, we have one minute to run to here.

4107
02:54:14,380 --> 02:54:18,620
So, like, me completing one task should be okay.

4108
02:54:19,240 --> 02:54:20,280
Question mark.

4109
02:54:22,160 --> 02:54:24,780
I just need to go up the stairs.

4110
02:54:24,880 --> 02:54:25,000
Okay.

4111
02:54:25,000 --> 02:54:25,200
Let's go up the stairs.

4112
02:54:25,200 --> 02:54:25,800
For that.

4113
02:54:26,120 --> 02:54:26,940
God damn it.

4114
02:54:26,980 --> 02:54:29,240
I wish I could, like, have you guys backseat me right now.

4115
02:54:29,740 --> 02:54:31,140
My brain is really tired.

4116
02:54:34,760 --> 02:54:35,680
I'm really tired.

4117
02:54:36,760 --> 02:54:39,260
I'm trying to strategize.

4118
02:54:41,500 --> 02:54:42,060
Oh.

4119
02:54:42,160 --> 02:54:43,120
One left.

4120
02:54:44,780 --> 02:54:46,140
Wherever they are.

4121
02:54:46,500 --> 02:54:47,600
Unlike the crowds.

4122
02:54:51,700 --> 02:54:52,820
One left.

4123
02:54:52,880 --> 02:54:53,640
Oh my god.

4124
02:54:53,660 --> 02:54:54,760
This guy might have five points.

4125
02:54:58,880 --> 02:55:06,160
God dammit, I know in this group of 80 people have photographic memory so they remember where each prop is.

4126
02:55:06,440 --> 02:55:07,460
I can feel it.

4127
02:55:07,580 --> 02:55:11,380
I can feel the photographic mem- oh shit.

4128
02:55:11,760 --> 02:55:15,020
And I'm gonna hit that by 0 points anyway so it doesn't matter.

4129
02:55:17,280 --> 02:55:20,760
It doesn't matter, I already have 0 points anyway.

4130
02:55:23,400 --> 02:55:24,140
There's me.

4131
02:55:24,880 --> 02:55:26,280
There's me over there.

4132
02:55:26,280 --> 02:55:28,280
Bro, people have 5 points?

4133
02:55:29,100 --> 02:55:30,340
Oh, it's the task.

4134
02:55:30,500 --> 02:55:31,160
It's the task!

4135
02:55:31,360 --> 02:55:32,580
That's what I'm saying!

4136
02:55:33,240 --> 02:55:35,360
They know where to go!

4137
02:55:35,920 --> 02:55:38,580
That's literally what I'm saying!

4138
02:55:38,700 --> 02:55:39,900
They know where to go!

4139
02:55:40,260 --> 02:55:42,720
Cause none of the area is randomized!

4140
02:55:44,620 --> 02:55:49,400
So they literally are just going the same place.

4141
02:55:49,620 --> 02:55:52,600
I wonder if the chest stuff is randomized or not.

4142
02:55:54,260 --> 02:55:55,960
That's what I'm saying guys!

4143
02:56:01,020 --> 02:56:03,220
Bro, people are hunters, man.

4144
02:56:04,880 --> 02:56:08,560
Literally a hunter can kill 5 people and they're safe.

4145
02:56:13,240 --> 02:56:15,020
You just need to kill 5.

4146
02:56:16,880 --> 02:56:19,100
Come on, hunter, hunter!

4147
02:56:19,920 --> 02:56:22,480
80 people, hunter RNG, let's go!

4148
02:56:23,340 --> 02:56:23,820
Oh my

4149
02:56:29,510 --> 02:56:31,550
god, where is the courtyard?

4150
02:56:34,070 --> 02:56:34,670
Guys.

4151
02:56:34,670 --> 02:56:38,290
I don't remember where this stuff is.

4152
02:56:40,470 --> 02:56:41,870
Wait, a lot of people are going this way.

4153
02:56:41,990 --> 02:56:43,170
That's it, that's it, that's it!

4154
02:56:43,870 --> 02:56:45,370
Follow the stones!

4155
02:56:52,010 --> 02:56:52,410
What?

4156
02:56:52,550 --> 02:56:54,130
Oh, what?!

4157
02:56:56,170 --> 02:56:57,230
Okay, this is dumb.

4158
02:57:08,760 --> 02:57:10,240
Oh my god, please.

4159
02:57:13,120 --> 02:57:13,920
And then...

4160
02:57:14,220 --> 02:57:16,200
Are you goddamn kidding...

4161
02:57:16,200 --> 02:57:16,520
Please.

4162
02:57:16,720 --> 02:57:17,520
For the love...

4163
02:57:17,520 --> 02:57:18,600
Please, just kill me.

4164
02:57:18,700 --> 02:57:19,320
I don't care.

4165
02:57:19,440 --> 02:57:19,840
Just...

4166
02:57:19,840 --> 02:57:20,820
Just let...

4167
02:57:20,820 --> 02:57:22,160
I can't.

4168
02:57:22,240 --> 02:57:23,320
I can't.

4169
02:57:23,320 --> 02:57:24,120
Just kill me.

4170
02:57:28,920 --> 02:57:31,120
Please, just let me have this, guys.

4171
02:57:31,220 --> 02:57:32,020
I can't.

4172
02:57:32,020 --> 02:57:32,660
I can't!

4173
02:57:32,660 --> 02:57:33,860
I literally can't!

4174
02:57:34,240 --> 02:57:37,840
Let me have this, guys!

4175
02:57:38,060 --> 02:57:38,620
Please!

4176
02:57:39,840 --> 02:57:41,060
Just kill me!

4177
02:57:44,820 --> 02:57:46,120
I can't!

4178
02:57:46,120 --> 02:57:47,420
I can't even M5!

4179
02:57:51,980 --> 02:57:53,100
I can't see!

4180
02:57:57,070 --> 02:57:58,430
I literally...

4181
02:57:58,430 --> 02:57:59,450
I can't...

4182
02:57:59,450 --> 02:58:00,930
Their body block is...

4183
02:58:00,930 --> 02:58:02,810
I can't even open it!

4184
02:58:03,090 --> 02:58:03,670
Bro!

4185
02:58:04,850 --> 02:58:08,570
Bro, we're stuck in third person, so I couldn't even...

4186
02:58:08,570 --> 02:58:10,650
I couldn't even hit it!

4187
02:58:11,290 --> 02:58:14,510
I wanted to go back to first person.

4188
02:58:14,950 --> 02:58:15,890
I actually...

4189
02:58:15,890 --> 02:58:16,390
I was like...

4190
02:58:16,390 --> 02:58:17,210
I can't!

4191
02:58:17,250 --> 02:58:19,070
Just put me back in first person!

4192
02:58:19,210 --> 02:58:20,990
I can't do third POV!

4193
02:58:21,330 --> 02:58:24,110
I can't do third POV!

4194
02:58:28,090 --> 02:58:29,830
Oh my god!

4195
02:58:29,950 --> 02:58:33,210
I cannot do third POV, man!

4196
02:58:33,310 --> 02:58:33,990
I can't!

4197
02:58:34,030 --> 02:58:35,970
It's actually terrible!

4198
02:58:36,890 --> 02:58:40,390
Third POV is actually a crime...

4199
02:58:40,390 --> 02:58:41,510
for a prop.

4200
02:58:45,920 --> 02:58:46,960
Oh my god.

4201
02:58:46,960 --> 02:58:49,500
I mean, that can't be the only prop left, right?

4202
02:58:51,700 --> 02:58:52,260
Nice!

4203
02:58:56,140 --> 02:58:57,640
Oh my god!

4204
02:58:57,740 --> 02:58:59,000
That five kill!

4205
02:58:59,180 --> 02:59:00,340
I told you it's better!

4206
02:59:02,720 --> 02:59:03,460
Wait, what?

4207
02:59:09,280 --> 02:59:09,840
Wait...

4208
02:59:09,840 --> 02:59:11,260
That's so dumb!

4209
02:59:19,580 --> 02:59:21,740
Can I have that five points, sir?

4210
02:59:23,120 --> 02:59:23,680
Please?

4211
02:59:25,820 --> 02:59:26,540
Please?

4212
02:59:39,850 --> 02:59:41,630
No, no, no, no...

4213
02:59:43,110 --> 02:59:44,250
No fair!

4214
02:59:45,830 --> 02:59:47,710
No, I had to wait...

4215
02:59:50,620 --> 02:59:51,820
It's not fair!

4216
02:59:52,260 --> 02:59:53,420
I had a cooldown!

4217
02:59:55,960 --> 02:59:58,960
Oh my god, I had a cooldown!

4218
03:00:00,460 --> 03:00:02,480
That could have been my points!

4219
03:00:04,600 --> 03:00:05,540
I'm sad.

4220
03:00:06,220 --> 03:00:08,260
I literally had a cooldown.

4221
03:00:09,620 --> 03:00:11,440
I literally had a cooldown.

4222
03:00:12,140 --> 03:00:13,020
I think it's sad.

4223
03:00:18,220 --> 03:00:19,540
Oh my god.

4224
03:00:22,420 --> 03:00:23,720
Cooldown shouldn't be a thing.

4225
03:00:23,900 --> 03:00:24,700
I'm gonna say it.

4226
03:00:24,960 --> 03:00:26,720
The cooldown should not be a thing.

4227
03:00:29,340 --> 03:00:30,440
Get rid of them!

4228
03:00:30,660 --> 03:00:32,560
Down with cooldowns!

4229
03:00:34,460 --> 03:00:36,240
Just the killing cooldown though.

4230
03:00:36,360 --> 03:00:37,960
I don't care about the ability cooldown.

4231
03:00:37,960 --> 03:00:40,220
Down with the killing cooldown!

4232
03:00:42,120 --> 03:00:44,120
I'm not gonna do the chest anymore.

4233
03:00:44,360 --> 03:00:46,220
That chest actually messed me up.

4234
03:00:46,740 --> 03:00:48,500
That messed me up so much.

4235
03:00:50,780 --> 03:00:52,260
Made me so sad.

4236
03:00:54,060 --> 03:00:57,220
That would've been an easy 10 points too.

4237
03:00:57,360 --> 03:00:58,700
I think that made me so sad.

4238
03:00:59,180 --> 03:01:02,860
Literally, if all those monsters didn't block me...

4239
03:01:02,860 --> 03:01:05,020
and I just needed to wait 5 more seconds...

4240
03:01:05,940 --> 03:01:06,920
10 points.

4241
03:01:10,800 --> 03:01:11,940
Oh my god.

4242
03:01:12,140 --> 03:01:12,400
Oh my god.

4243
03:01:14,240 --> 03:01:16,640
And then the monsters that body blocked me...

4244
03:01:16,640 --> 03:01:18,760
so I couldn't even see anything.

4245
03:01:18,980 --> 03:01:19,380
What the?

4246
03:01:19,540 --> 03:01:20,440
Oh, that's the admin.

4247
03:01:20,820 --> 03:01:22,560
I was like, what was that?

4248
03:01:24,220 --> 03:01:26,620
At least not 0 points, guys.

4249
03:01:26,760 --> 03:01:28,800
At least not 0 points.

4250
03:01:29,400 --> 03:01:34,760
At least not 0 points.

4251
03:01:34,840 --> 03:01:36,000
That's all that matters.

4252
03:01:41,780 --> 03:01:44,360
We made it to not 0 points.

4253
03:01:51,630 --> 03:01:53,070
Definitely wish a lot of...

4254
03:01:53,070 --> 03:01:55,690
I would definitely wish some of these were in the rules.

4255
03:01:58,910 --> 03:02:01,290
I know we already had 1,000 words.

4256
03:02:01,890 --> 03:02:05,190
But like, if I had 1,500...

4257
03:02:05,190 --> 03:02:07,810
I don't mind if it went to 1,500.

4258
03:02:07,810 --> 03:02:09,570
I do not mind.

4259
03:02:13,370 --> 03:02:16,430
If I already read 1,000, I could read 500 more.

4260
03:02:19,390 --> 03:02:22,290
I could've definitely read 500 more words.

4261
03:02:28,050 --> 03:02:30,330
Wait, there's so many of us as well!

4262
03:02:30,410 --> 03:02:30,670
Okay.

4263
03:02:30,910 --> 03:02:31,390
Okay.

4264
03:02:31,710 --> 03:02:32,930
Oh my god, wait.

4265
03:02:33,410 --> 03:02:33,890
Wait.

4266
03:02:33,990 --> 03:02:35,250
This is so good.

4267
03:02:37,530 --> 03:02:38,290
Oh my god.

4268
03:02:38,310 --> 03:02:40,550
No wonder they couldn't kill us right off the bat.

4269
03:02:40,550 --> 03:02:43,090
I've realized why they couldn't kill us right off the bat!

4270
03:02:46,370 --> 03:02:48,250
Oh, it makes sense now!

4271
03:02:52,990 --> 03:02:55,750
Why they couldn't kill us right off the bat!

4272
03:02:57,790 --> 03:02:59,110
Oh my god.

4273
03:02:59,390 --> 03:03:02,530
Everything makes so much more sense now.

4274
03:03:03,030 --> 03:03:04,310
Oh my god.

4275
03:03:05,630 --> 03:03:06,130
Wait.

4276
03:03:06,270 --> 03:03:07,870
Oh, there's a bone right here.

4277
03:03:08,450 --> 03:03:09,690
There's a bone right...

4278
03:03:09,970 --> 03:03:10,450
Wait, what?

4279
03:03:11,490 --> 03:03:12,510
What the heck?

4280
03:03:13,270 --> 03:03:13,790
No.

4281
03:03:14,430 --> 03:03:15,430
Oh, that's not good.

4282
03:03:15,730 --> 03:03:16,170
Oh, wait.

4283
03:03:17,770 --> 03:03:18,490
Come on.

4284
03:03:18,510 --> 03:03:18,890
Come on.

4285
03:03:18,890 --> 03:03:19,250
Come on.

4286
03:03:19,270 --> 03:03:19,650
Let me...

4287
03:03:19,650 --> 03:03:20,670
Let me munch you.

4288
03:03:21,250 --> 03:03:22,430
Let me munch you!

4289
03:03:24,650 --> 03:03:25,170
Yes!

4290
03:03:25,730 --> 03:03:26,630
Prop kill down.

4291
03:03:26,990 --> 03:03:27,510
Yay!

4292
03:03:28,970 --> 03:03:29,490
Okay.

4293
03:03:30,050 --> 03:03:31,950
Now to wait another minute.

4294
03:03:34,490 --> 03:03:37,250
Now to wait one minute, yeah.

4295
03:03:39,330 --> 03:03:40,190
I'll just...

4296
03:03:40,890 --> 03:03:42,610
Now to wait a minute.

4297
03:03:47,110 --> 03:03:49,310
Now to wait 30 seconds.

4298
03:03:52,010 --> 03:03:52,490
Yay!

4299
03:03:53,370 --> 03:03:55,410
I'm gonna chase you down, sir.

4300
03:03:56,010 --> 03:03:57,330
Until it's over.

4301
03:03:58,110 --> 03:03:59,730
Until I nom you up.

4302
03:03:59,850 --> 03:04:01,050
Nom, nom, nom, nom, nom.

4303
03:04:01,770 --> 03:04:03,170

You guys got this, guys.

You guys got this.

03:04:46,010 --> 03:04:46,690
You know what?

4320
03:04:46,710 --> 03:04:47,570
I... You know what?

4321
03:04:47,610 --> 03:04:48,010
Fuck you.

4322
03:04:48,070 --> 03:04:50,050
I had to... I got body blocked too.

4323
03:04:53,290 --> 03:04:55,450
I got body blocked too!

4324
03:04:57,770 --> 03:05:00,310
You don't get to have this.

4325
03:05:01,050 --> 03:05:02,250

Who nom'd him?

4330
03:05:07,510 --> 03:05:08,190
Wait.

4331
03:05:08,290 --> 03:05:09,230
That was my nom!

4332
03:05:13,010 --> 03:05:14,790
That was my nom!

4333
03:05:15,650 --> 03:05:23,050

03:05:33,630 --> 03:05:34,890
That was my nom time!

4338
03:05:34,890 --> 03:05:35,090
That was my nom time!

4339
03:05:35,090 --> 03:05:35,830
Ahahaha!

4340
03:05:36,330 --> 03:05:37,750
It's my turn to nom!

4341
03:05:40,070 --> 03:05:42,110
Nom, nom, nom, nom, nom, nom!

4342
03:05:44,190 --> 03:05:45,450
You don't get that.

4343
03:05:46,090 --> 03:05:46,830
Forget that!

4344
03:05:47,870 --> 03:05:49,810
After all the pain I had to go through.

4345
03:05:51,070 --> 03:05:52,370
You don't get that nom.

4346
03:05:53,430 --> 03:05:53,970
Oh hey.

4347
03:05:54,370 --> 03:05:55,490
Nom, nom, nom, nom, nom!

4348
03:05:56,450 --> 03:05:57,570
Nom, nom, nom, nom, nom!

4349
03:05:57,970 --> 03:05:58,730
Back here!

4350
03:05:59,790 --> 03:06:00,950
Nom, nom, nom, nom, nom!

4351
03:06:02,110 --> 03:06:02,510
Ow!

4352
03:06:07,720 --> 03:06:08,840
My nom!

4353
03:06:10,460 --> 03:06:11,720
Oh, you have cool down.

4354
03:06:13,860 --> 03:06:15,120
You have a cool down.

4355
03:06:16,340 --> 03:06:19,040
I steal that like how you stole my cool down.

4356
03:06:22,420 --> 03:06:23,600
No, I can't see.

4357
03:06:25,980 --> 03:06:27,040
Where did he go?

4358
03:06:30,990 --> 03:06:32,050
Where did he go?

4359
03:06:42,320 --> 03:06:43,540
Wait, where did he go?

4360
03:06:43,540 --> 03:06:47,640
Oh, no, my free nom.

4361
03:06:53,640 --> 03:06:54,380
What?

4362
03:06:55,160 --> 03:06:56,820
There's no way.

4363
03:06:57,400 --> 03:06:59,460
Okay, no, no.

4364
03:06:59,600 --> 03:07:01,060
Are you serious?

4365
03:07:01,780 --> 03:07:03,640
Okay, I'm actually mad.

4366
03:07:03,880 --> 03:07:05,160
There's no way.

4367
03:07:05,420 --> 03:07:11,860
Like, I had so many points because I nommed.

4368
03:07:13,060 --> 03:07:15,040
They're restarting it?

4369
03:07:15,700 --> 03:07:16,440
What?

4370
03:07:16,740 --> 03:07:17,480
Okay.

4371
03:07:17,880 --> 03:07:18,840
That's actually not fair.

4372
03:07:19,220 --> 03:07:20,720
I actually don't like that.

4373
03:07:21,160 --> 03:07:26,240
Like, I actually had the best round of my life and they're restarting it.

4374
03:07:28,080 --> 03:07:29,360
Oh, my God.

4375
03:07:30,720 --> 03:07:32,080
That made me sad.

4376
03:07:32,300 --> 03:07:33,520
That actually made me sad.

4377
03:07:35,320 --> 03:07:37,600
I feel like they should just commit to it.

4378
03:07:37,680 --> 03:07:39,980
There's no, they should just commit to it.

4379
03:07:42,360 --> 03:07:45,760
Like, honestly, there's no reason to keep.

4380
03:07:48,060 --> 03:07:51,480
Because like everybody... because it's RNG for the hunters.

4381
03:07:52,240 --> 03:07:54,520
Literally, whoever gets hunters wins.

4382
03:07:55,940 --> 03:08:05,020
So, it's like, I don't feel like they should just... they should rerun it because like the people who got hunters last time, like there's no guarantee they're gonna get hunter again.

4383
03:08:05,920 --> 03:08:11,880
So like, you might as well just commit to it because they didn't restart the other games when it wasn't fair.

4384
03:08:13,600 --> 03:08:18,000
I know like a lot of people complain about this game because the game was That was actually messed up.

4385
03:08:20,100 --> 03:08:22,460
But like, I feel like they should have committed.

4386
03:08:23,540 --> 03:08:24,720
Because it took like...

4387
03:08:24,720 --> 03:08:27,760
We had like a 40 minute delay to set this game up too.

4388
03:08:28,400 --> 03:08:32,180
And then, like we already committed four rounds to it.

4389
03:08:32,860 --> 03:08:35,000
Like four rounds has been committed already.

4390
03:08:36,960 --> 03:08:39,460
I don't even know if I like made it in too.

4391
03:08:39,760 --> 03:08:41,500
Like, I don't know if I made it in.

4392
03:08:41,520 --> 03:08:42,740
I just feel like, you know...

4393
03:08:42,740 --> 03:08:45,060
We already committed four rounds of this.

4394
03:08:45,060 --> 03:08:47,540
We might as well just commit to the full...

4395
03:08:47,540 --> 03:08:49,660
Just keep going, you know?

4396
03:08:50,960 --> 03:08:52,700
At that point, we should just keep going.

4397
03:08:58,820 --> 03:09:01,620
I got the hunter too.

4398
03:09:01,820 --> 03:09:03,940
And I nom nom nom nom.

4399
03:09:04,780 --> 03:09:06,680
I nom nom nom nom.

4400
03:09:09,560 --> 03:09:11,400
I worked so hard.

4401
03:09:12,060 --> 03:09:13,960
I nom nom nom nom.

4402
03:09:15,700 --> 03:09:18,740
And I don't get to keep my points.

4403
03:09:20,400 --> 03:09:21,660
Oh, I get eliminated anyway.

4404
03:09:21,900 --> 03:09:22,500
Like what the...

4405
03:09:22,500 --> 03:09:24,020
It doesn't matter.

4406
03:09:24,380 --> 03:09:25,200
I already got...

4407
03:09:25,200 --> 03:09:25,780
Wait, no?

4408
03:09:26,020 --> 03:09:27,380
Wait, I don't.

4409
03:09:27,380 --> 03:09:28,080
Wait, I would...

4410
03:09:28,080 --> 03:09:28,560
Oh no, I do.

4411
03:09:28,640 --> 03:09:29,120
I'm 24.

4412
03:09:29,420 --> 03:09:30,680
I got eliminated anyway.

4413
03:09:33,580 --> 03:09:34,920
And I still said...

4414
03:09:35,580 --> 03:09:36,180
Keep it.

4415
03:09:45,950 --> 03:09:48,830
People are now complaining because...

4416
03:09:49,310 --> 03:09:50,450
People are like...

4417
03:09:51,510 --> 03:09:53,630
Some people kept going.

4418
03:09:54,030 --> 03:09:54,870
Kept like...

4419
03:09:54,870 --> 03:09:58,130
Some people actually stopped playing because they said they're going to rerun it.

4420
03:09:58,870 --> 03:10:00,010
So people are mad.

4421
03:10:00,370 --> 03:10:03,630
It's like now they're in a lose-lose situation now.

4422
03:10:03,930 --> 03:10:07,770
They're in a lose-lose situation because they said like keep it.

4423
03:10:07,970 --> 03:10:11,250
But because if they kept it, a lot of people actually...

4424
03:10:15,050 --> 03:10:16,730
Like because like...

4425
03:10:20,250 --> 03:10:20,730
Uh...

4426
03:10:21,910 --> 03:10:23,810
Wait, are we keeping it?

4427
03:10:23,870 --> 03:10:24,470
I'm eliminated.

4428
03:10:27,430 --> 03:10:29,650
Oh, apparently the chest...

4429
03:10:31,590 --> 03:10:33,070
The chest was broken.

4430
03:10:33,310 --> 03:10:34,230
Remember that chest?

4431
03:10:34,890 --> 03:10:36,110
Guys, I don't even know.

4432
03:10:36,210 --> 03:10:37,310
Are we eliminated or not?

4433
03:10:40,900 --> 03:10:42,540
Apparently, you know that chest?

4434
03:10:42,920 --> 03:10:45,600
Where I was like, what the heck is this chest?

4435
03:10:45,780 --> 03:10:46,300
You know?

4436
03:10:47,580 --> 03:10:49,580
I was like, what the heck is that chest?

4437
03:10:49,840 --> 03:10:50,580
That chest...

4438
03:10:50,580 --> 03:10:52,300
That chest was broken for everybody.

4439
03:10:52,680 --> 03:10:55,600
Nobody was able to open that chest.

4440
03:10:56,600 --> 03:10:58,080
I'm reading the general.

4441
03:11:00,600 --> 03:11:01,400
Nobody...

4442
03:11:02,140 --> 03:11:04,980
Nobody was able to read that.

4443
03:11:05,300 --> 03:11:08,160
Nobody was able to open that chest.

4444
03:11:16,080 --> 03:11:18,060
Oh my God.

4445
03:11:21,020 --> 03:11:22,480
Oh my God.

4446
03:11:23,000 --> 03:11:24,300
People are mad.

4447
03:11:24,540 --> 03:11:26,360
People are so mad.

4448
03:11:27,060 --> 03:11:29,820
Yeah, there's some crucial info not to be given.

4449
03:11:30,040 --> 03:11:32,420
Yeah, people are complaining about the fact that...

4450
03:11:33,540 --> 03:11:34,040
Hello?

4451
03:11:34,540 --> 03:11:36,980
Oh my... people are so angry right now.

4452
03:11:38,940 --> 03:11:39,840
I'll be honest.

4453
03:11:40,000 --> 03:11:42,020
I was really annoyed throughout the game.

4454
03:11:42,120 --> 03:11:43,720
I just did not give a fuck at some point.

4455
03:11:43,980 --> 03:11:44,840
Yeah, I was like...

4456
03:11:44,840 --> 03:11:46,760
I was complaining because like I didn't know.

4457
03:11:46,880 --> 03:11:49,740
They told us a hundred abilities that one of them can literally see.

4458
03:11:50,240 --> 03:11:50,780
The prop.

4459
03:11:51,920 --> 03:11:52,280
Like...

4460
03:11:52,280 --> 03:11:53,880
And so like what's the point of hiding?

4461
03:11:54,520 --> 03:11:56,420
They have the ability to see a prop.

4462
03:11:57,440 --> 03:11:58,400
And I didn't know.

4463
03:11:58,920 --> 03:11:59,940
Three minute cooldown.

4464
03:12:00,440 --> 03:12:02,960
Yeah, but like when you start out, you don't know, you know?

4465
03:12:03,100 --> 03:12:05,360
So like I stood still because I was like, oh, okay.

4466
03:12:05,420 --> 03:12:07,980
I have like 50 seconds and there was like three hunters around me.

4467
03:12:08,260 --> 03:12:11,380
And then like and then they wouldn't just walked up to me and killed me.

4468
03:12:11,440 --> 03:12:12,340
So I was so confused.

4469
03:12:12,420 --> 03:12:13,280
I was like, what the heck?

4470
03:12:13,280 --> 03:12:14,320
And then looked at the hundred abilities.

4471
03:12:14,380 --> 03:12:18,060
I was like, oh if I knew that that specific monster can see props.

4472
03:12:18,300 --> 03:12:19,360
I wouldn't have stood still.

4473
03:12:19,740 --> 03:12:22,200
I would have been like, what the heck?

4474
03:12:23,080 --> 03:12:24,920
It feels very...

4475
03:12:25,800 --> 03:12:26,960
It's hunter-sided.

4476
03:12:27,320 --> 03:12:29,800
It's very, it's overly hunter-sided.

4477
03:12:29,900 --> 03:12:31,180
Yeah, no, 100%.

4478
03:12:36,380 --> 03:12:39,760
And like the puzzles were all the same area.

4479
03:12:40,800 --> 03:12:42,780
Yeah, so hunters knew where to camp.

4480
03:12:42,900 --> 03:12:44,840
I saw like five different people camping.

4481
03:12:45,000 --> 03:12:45,340
Yeah.

4482
03:12:45,340 --> 03:12:45,640
Yeah.

4483
03:12:45,640 --> 03:12:45,860
Yeah.

4484
03:12:46,200 --> 03:12:48,820
Like I had a key and they were camping the chest.

4485
03:12:48,880 --> 03:12:49,720
Like it was just joking.

4486
03:12:49,720 --> 03:12:50,600
Yeah.

4487
03:12:50,780 --> 03:12:52,040
Yeah, like it was just no point.

4488
03:12:52,240 --> 03:12:54,600
Like because it would all just like there.

4489
03:12:55,220 --> 03:13:00,280
I feel like at that point someone's like you guys are a crime because you don't want to die.

4490
03:13:00,380 --> 03:13:02,280
No, because it was bullshit.

4491
03:13:02,500 --> 03:13:03,480
Wait, is that?

4492
03:13:03,940 --> 03:13:05,720
Guess who complained about that?

4493
03:13:05,800 --> 03:13:06,380
You see that?

4494
03:13:08,220 --> 03:13:08,660
Sap.

4495
03:13:10,760 --> 03:13:12,440
Wait, but Sap got eliminated.

4496
03:13:14,080 --> 03:13:16,660
Yeah, but he's like, he's a millionaire.

4497
03:13:16,880 --> 03:13:17,700
So he didn't do a fuck.

4498
03:13:18,120 --> 03:13:18,560
Yeah.

4499
03:13:18,560 --> 03:13:19,700
But then right after that, I was like, oh shit.

4500
03:13:19,700 --> 03:13:22,740
He was like, that was the worst game I've ever played.

4501
03:13:23,420 --> 03:13:26,660
Like I don't if they run back any other game.

4502
03:13:26,840 --> 03:13:28,380
I think it'd be fine rather than rerunning.

4503
03:13:28,480 --> 03:13:31,060
Yeah, I feel like it was just I was annoyed.

4504
03:13:31,220 --> 03:13:32,100
I was actually here.

4505
03:13:32,580 --> 03:13:35,440
I feel like the rules for the hunter.

4506
03:13:36,120 --> 03:13:38,660
The hunter ability should have been given to us.

4507
03:13:38,740 --> 03:13:40,360
If they already wrote a thousand ways for rules.

4508
03:13:41,400 --> 03:13:47,260
They kind of they kind of did give us the hunters abilities in the video, but not really.

4509
03:13:47,440 --> 03:13:49,500
I didn't know what it wasn't told to us.

4510
03:13:50,220 --> 03:13:50,940
They did.

4511
03:13:51,040 --> 03:13:51,240
They did.

4512
03:13:51,480 --> 03:13:54,640
They did the red one changes into a problem.

4513
03:13:54,680 --> 03:13:55,380
The black one.

4514
03:13:55,760 --> 03:13:59,680
The black eyeball ones changes into no, the red one can see props.

4515
03:14:00,420 --> 03:14:01,800
No, there's two red ones.

4516
03:14:01,940 --> 03:14:08,220
Oh, the red dinosaur one has can reveal props for a bit to itself.

4517
03:14:08,520 --> 03:14:09,400
I didn't know.

4518
03:14:09,460 --> 03:14:13,740
I didn't register that because people were talking to so I didn't register it quite.

4519
03:14:13,840 --> 03:14:16,680
Well, yeah, I was really annoyed when people were.

4520
03:14:16,700 --> 03:14:18,160
Yeah, it's just I don't know.

4521
03:14:18,260 --> 03:14:19,600
I feel like and then.

4522
03:14:19,700 --> 03:14:23,740
The fact that I would say we're going to rerun it and then like people actually stop playing.

4523
03:14:26,180 --> 03:14:37,140
Was like didn't like apparently a couple people like stopped a couple of people actually stopped playing and got eliminated because they heard it was going to be rerun.

4524
03:14:44,980 --> 03:14:45,920
Holy shit.

4525
03:14:45,940 --> 03:14:46,840
Sap is angry.

4526
03:14:49,660 --> 03:14:52,540
Don't running a different game is not an option.

4527
03:14:52,780 --> 03:14:54,140
Don't eliminate anyone.

4528
03:14:54,240 --> 03:14:54,720
Just do more.

4529
03:14:54,720 --> 03:14:55,640
Limbs for other games.

4530
03:14:55,700 --> 03:14:56,440
That game was shit.

4531
03:14:56,520 --> 03:14:57,800
Like I okay, you know what?

4532
03:14:57,820 --> 03:14:58,700
That's on our side.

4533
03:14:59,020 --> 03:15:08,100
Oh my God, they're not running any other games and they want to rerun that same game.

4534
03:15:08,180 --> 03:15:10,860
Dude, right running the same game doesn't change.

4535
03:15:11,080 --> 03:15:13,120
And yeah, it would be a hundred sided.

4536
03:15:13,260 --> 03:15:16,380
It's just Hunter said if I got Hunter to I got Hunter.

4537
03:15:16,680 --> 03:15:18,840
So like I saw you catch up in point.

4538
03:15:18,960 --> 03:15:22,880
Yeah, I literally caught up because I got like four kills.

4539
03:15:24,720 --> 03:15:33,860
And the thing is I tried to get killed early and there was just fuckers dancing around with props because like why would you kill a prop if you're ahead and like you don't.

4540
03:15:34,940 --> 03:15:37,260
If you kill them, it's like less props for you.

4541
03:15:37,600 --> 03:15:38,060
Yeah.

4542
03:15:38,180 --> 03:15:38,400
Yeah.

4543
03:15:38,440 --> 03:15:38,560
Yeah.

4544
03:15:38,560 --> 03:15:40,260
So they were like camping other props too.

4545
03:15:40,940 --> 03:15:44,960
I saw like three people just running around with props for fun.

4546
03:15:45,140 --> 03:15:45,660
Yeah.

4547
03:15:47,580 --> 03:15:52,020
It's actually I feel like yeah this that one was actually.

4548
03:15:52,460 --> 03:15:54,600
Uh, that one.

4549
03:15:54,600 --> 03:15:55,740
It was actually messed up.

4550
03:15:55,780 --> 03:15:56,620
I feel like.

4551
03:15:59,000 --> 03:16:01,960
And the thing is there's so many there's 80 of us too.

4552
03:16:02,260 --> 03:16:04,940
So like the fact that there's like 80 of us.

4553
03:16:06,280 --> 03:16:08,020
She's gonna be a lot of complaining.

4554
03:16:09,960 --> 03:16:15,000
No, like once the event ended or the round ended and we got eliminated.

4555
03:16:15,220 --> 03:16:17,940
I saw the general chat move like 20 messages.

4556
03:16:18,020 --> 03:16:18,320
Yeah.

4557
03:16:18,360 --> 03:16:18,880
Yeah.

4558
03:16:18,880 --> 03:16:19,300
Yeah.

4559
03:16:19,300 --> 03:16:20,340
It's just like.

4560
03:16:23,040 --> 03:16:24,080
I was lucky.

4561
03:16:24,080 --> 03:16:27,880
I was like, oh my God, it's so fast.

4562
03:16:30,360 --> 03:16:31,900
Nobody is happy.

4563
03:16:35,700 --> 03:16:36,180
Damn.

4564
03:16:36,240 --> 03:16:37,100
I'm just hopping on balance.

4565
03:16:37,320 --> 03:16:37,880
Oh my God.

4566
03:16:37,920 --> 03:16:38,880
Wait, what's the chest broken?

4567
03:16:39,080 --> 03:16:41,020
Because like people were complaining that the chest was broken.

4568
03:16:41,240 --> 03:16:41,840
Yeah, I was.

4569
03:16:42,060 --> 03:16:46,080
My chest was laughing at me because I was like, why can't I open the chest?

4570
03:16:47,180 --> 03:16:52,020
If you're like laughing at me, I didn't realize the chest was broken.

4571
03:16:53,440 --> 03:16:54,600
I just gave up.

4572
03:16:54,640 --> 03:16:55,440
The chest was broken.

4573
03:16:55,640 --> 03:16:56,800
You can't click the middle part.

4574
03:16:57,180 --> 03:16:58,880
I just I just gave up.

4575
03:16:58,980 --> 03:17:03,420
Yeah, I was so confused.

4576
03:17:03,700 --> 03:17:05,880
I thought I was being stupid.

4577
03:17:06,080 --> 03:17:08,000
I thought I was like, why can't I click the middle part?

4578
03:17:08,120 --> 03:17:09,140
I'm so confused.

4579
03:17:10,000 --> 03:17:12,240
Then my chat was laughing at me.

4580
03:17:13,200 --> 03:17:15,940
I thought it was me, but it's not me.

4581
03:17:16,880 --> 03:17:18,160
It wasn't me.

4582
03:17:22,300 --> 03:17:25,060
Did someone just said just give one thousand to everyone?

4583
03:17:27,200 --> 03:17:27,600
Bro.

4584
03:17:27,780 --> 03:17:28,240
Okay.

4585
03:17:28,920 --> 03:17:30,360
I agree.

4586
03:17:31,100 --> 03:17:33,320
I agree you.

4587
03:17:34,420 --> 03:17:36,360
1K for everyone.

4588
03:17:41,740 --> 03:17:45,520
1K for getting to top 80.

4589
03:17:52,020 --> 03:17:54,680
We don't minecrafters don't need 70K.

4590
03:18:00,540 --> 03:18:01,940
That shit was so annoying.

4591
03:18:02,140 --> 03:18:09,480
Oh, I want like I I think I went fucking nonverbal because I was just so annoyed that I was getting camped or like this.

4592
03:18:09,540 --> 03:18:10,220
And now we're having.

4593
03:18:11,460 --> 03:18:12,720
I kind of just want it out.

4594
03:18:13,700 --> 03:18:18,200
Like is in the fact that it's like 80, 80 people.

4595
03:18:19,980 --> 03:18:20,360
80.

4596
03:18:20,440 --> 03:18:21,780
Like eight people gets that.

4597
03:18:21,780 --> 03:18:22,160
That'd be Hunter.

4598
03:18:22,260 --> 03:18:24,000
But there's not enough Hunter spots for everybody.

4599
03:18:27,950 --> 03:18:29,530
I'm turning off emote only for now.

4600
03:18:29,810 --> 03:18:30,470
Yeah, me too.

4601
03:18:30,710 --> 03:18:32,110
Are turning out emo only.

4602
03:18:32,290 --> 03:18:33,410
How do you turn off emo only?

4603
03:18:33,530 --> 03:18:33,790
I don't know.

4604
03:18:33,790 --> 03:18:34,510
My mods still away.

4605
03:18:35,170 --> 03:18:36,010
Oh my God.

4606
03:18:36,150 --> 03:18:37,410
Am I monitoring your channel?

4607
03:18:37,450 --> 03:18:39,110
So I'm I know I am nevermind.

4608
03:18:39,510 --> 03:18:40,670
You are you should be.

4609
03:18:40,930 --> 03:18:41,550
I don't know.

4610
03:18:41,570 --> 03:18:42,750
My let me check.

4611
03:18:42,870 --> 03:18:43,070
I'll do.

4612
03:18:43,170 --> 03:18:43,710
Oh, no, no, no.

4613
03:18:43,750 --> 03:18:44,150
My moderator.

4614
03:18:44,170 --> 03:18:45,050
So wait moderator.

4615
03:18:45,150 --> 03:18:45,650
Can you?

4616
03:18:45,670 --> 03:18:46,150
Oh, nice.

4617
03:18:46,230 --> 03:18:46,630
Thank you.

4618
03:18:46,630 --> 03:18:46,890
Mine.

4619
03:18:47,510 --> 03:18:48,130
All right guys.

4620
03:18:48,170 --> 03:18:48,830
Now you can go.

4621
03:18:48,850 --> 03:18:49,730
It was awful.

4622
03:18:49,810 --> 03:18:50,970
I know it was awful.

4623
03:18:51,030 --> 03:18:51,990
You guys can yell now.

4624
03:18:53,730 --> 03:18:55,530
It was so fucking bad.

4625
03:18:59,310 --> 03:19:02,150
Like I understand the inherent like.

4626
03:19:03,150 --> 03:19:04,550
The way they want to do it.

4627
03:19:04,630 --> 03:19:07,090
I thought they would at least split lobbies or something.

4628
03:19:07,790 --> 03:19:09,970
Yeah, if they split lobbies, that would make sense.

4629
03:19:10,170 --> 03:19:13,170
No, and it took like like it took like 40 minutes of prep time.

4630
03:19:17,060 --> 03:19:20,720
It took like nearly 40 minutes of prep time just for it to not be.

4631
03:19:23,720 --> 03:19:25,220
There was a cool down.

4632
03:19:25,220 --> 03:19:26,840
A one minute for the hunters.

4633
03:19:28,860 --> 03:19:31,900
Yeah, there was 100s get like a one minute cooldown.

4634
03:19:32,120 --> 03:19:36,660
But like if you start as Hunter, I literally got like 20 points from with the cooldowns.

4635
03:19:36,960 --> 03:19:42,840
Yeah, cuz like once you start as Hunter, everyone's literally running around trying to do that task.

4636
03:19:43,020 --> 03:19:44,480
Also, they did so easy.

4637
03:19:44,540 --> 03:19:45,760
I get killed like right off the bat.

4638
03:19:46,440 --> 03:19:48,960
And I couldn't tell if you can redo the same task.

4639
03:19:49,100 --> 03:19:51,340
If I knew that I would have stayed at the same task.

4640
03:19:51,420 --> 03:19:51,900
Wait, you can.

4641
03:19:52,860 --> 03:19:54,900
Yeah, it seems like the task.

4642
03:19:54,900 --> 03:19:55,920
Reset each round.

4643
03:19:59,140 --> 03:19:59,540
Yeah.

4644
03:20:01,760 --> 03:20:06,060
If they're not going to randomize the location make there be like a barrier so the hunters can't camp it.

4645
03:20:07,020 --> 03:20:08,220
Yeah, I think so.

4646
03:20:08,400 --> 03:20:14,740
Like if they make a barrier around a task, at least it like lets a prop get some points when they're camping that shit.

4647
03:20:15,180 --> 03:20:18,760
Cuz like on the very first round, I got the key for the chest.

4648
03:20:18,960 --> 03:20:20,720
Yeah, it was just a Hunter standing at it right away.

4649
03:20:20,800 --> 03:20:21,740
Like I couldn't do nothing.

4650
03:20:21,820 --> 03:20:24,000
And then I got chased by another Hunter because they saw I had the key.

4651
03:20:24,900 --> 03:20:25,100
Yeah.

4652
03:20:25,760 --> 03:20:34,060
And then it's just the fact that like the puzzles didn't rotate and people were just doing the same task over and over again.

4653
03:20:34,560 --> 03:20:37,600
And they just had like a pathway to like a path.

4654
03:20:37,720 --> 03:20:43,540
If the puzzles like if the puzzles themselves randomized, it would have been more fair because people don't have like a set pathway.

4655
03:20:45,920 --> 03:20:53,940
And the fact that they decided that at the very last game that it's not working and then they say it said it in the middle of the game for everybody.

4656
03:20:54,460 --> 03:20:55,700
It's what was messed up.

4657
03:20:55,800 --> 03:20:57,580
They should have just like said in the first round.

4658
03:20:58,560 --> 03:20:59,380
If they didn't.

4659
03:20:59,380 --> 03:21:03,040
If they did not say like we should reset then like people would have been fine.

4660
03:21:03,180 --> 03:21:06,140
But the fact that they said we should reset and...

4661
03:21:07,620 --> 03:21:11,260
Umm Then like then like...

4662
03:21:11,260 --> 03:21:12,040
Then they would have been...

4663
03:21:12,040 --> 03:21:15,080
Everybody would have been more agreeable with the elimination.

4664
03:21:16,740 --> 03:21:19,080
Yeah, a couple of the tasks were definitely broken.

4665
03:21:19,260 --> 03:21:19,500
Yeah.

4666
03:21:21,200 --> 03:21:22,820
I didn't even realize certain...

4667
03:21:22,820 --> 03:21:23,920
I didn't know it.

4668
03:21:23,940 --> 03:21:25,340
No, certain items have certain abilities.

4669
03:21:29,720 --> 03:21:30,980
Oh my god, woah.

4670
03:21:38,730 --> 03:21:41,530
Yeah, apparently some people didn't get Hunter and they're mad.

4671
03:21:41,830 --> 03:21:44,710
Because like, they couldn't make it.

4672
03:21:44,970 --> 03:21:48,270
Just rerun the pr- I don't want to rerun the dog game, man!

4673
03:21:48,750 --> 03:21:49,790
The dog game!

4674
03:21:49,790 --> 03:21:53,610
The admins literally said they can't rerun any of the past games.

4675
03:21:54,190 --> 03:21:57,550
I don't understand why they couldn't rerun any of the past ones though.

4676
03:22:00,810 --> 03:22:01,650
I don't know.

4677
03:22:02,610 --> 03:22:04,270
Doki, let's make our own Twitch Rivals.

4678
03:22:04,510 --> 03:22:08,770
Yeah, you know they actually offered for me to- Why did you say yes?

4679
03:22:09,390 --> 03:22:09,870
What?

4680
03:22:10,810 --> 03:22:11,770
Did you say yes?

4681
03:22:13,370 --> 03:22:14,230
Is it bad?

4682
03:22:15,470 --> 03:22:17,850
No, I'm asking, did you say yes?

4683
03:22:19,710 --> 03:22:23,290
Well, we're still- I don't know any other details.

4684
03:22:23,370 --> 03:22:25,810
They just asked me if I wanted to do a Twitch Rival.

4685
03:22:26,010 --> 03:22:26,790
If you wanted to?

4686
03:22:27,150 --> 03:22:28,470
I thought it would be cool.

4687
03:22:29,590 --> 03:22:31,050
I'm asking, did you say yes?

4688
03:22:31,050 --> 03:22:32,830
Did you say yes?

4689
03:22:33,250 --> 03:22:36,410
If you say yes, code a good one at least.

4690
03:22:36,550 --> 03:22:37,650
Make sure it's a good one.

4691
03:22:38,490 --> 03:22:38,970
Yeah...

4692
03:22:38,970 --> 03:22:44,370
Oh yeah, because like, your reputation gets hit for having a bad one.

4693
03:22:44,770 --> 03:22:46,970
And it's not even your fault, I feel like.

4694
03:22:46,990 --> 03:22:47,550
Not necessarily.

4695
03:22:47,970 --> 03:22:54,650
Well, they will say like, oh, remember that HenaXXRose Twitch Rivals that happened?

4696
03:22:54,850 --> 03:22:55,890
That one was shit.

4697
03:22:56,130 --> 03:22:57,890
Like, it will be tied to your name.

4698
03:22:58,010 --> 03:22:58,810
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

4699
03:23:00,530 --> 03:23:01,590
Yeah, that's why.

4700
03:23:02,310 --> 03:23:03,790
That's why, that's why.

4701
03:23:04,170 --> 03:23:05,610
That's why it's like, risky.

4702
03:23:10,810 --> 03:23:11,970
Dude, run a...

4703
03:23:11,970 --> 03:23:14,970
Well, I think just Mr. Toast.

4704
03:23:15,810 --> 03:23:17,930
Multiple Apex Legends Twitch Rivals.

4705
03:23:28,050 --> 03:23:29,130
Oh my god.

4706
03:23:29,990 --> 03:23:31,110
There's no winning.

4707
03:23:31,570 --> 03:23:33,490
There's actually no winning.

4708
03:23:33,990 --> 03:23:37,650
I'm just talking.

4709
03:23:39,970 --> 03:23:44,530
Honestly, like, elimination or not, I kind of don't give a fuck at this point.

4710
03:23:44,870 --> 03:23:45,990
I think like...

4711
03:23:47,150 --> 03:23:50,510
I like how people are like, I got propped four times and made it.

4712
03:23:51,930 --> 03:23:57,210
And then they're like, well, to be fair, they are full on Minecraft players, so they know how to...

4713
03:23:57,210 --> 03:23:58,810
They have like, set routes and stuff.

4714
03:23:59,410 --> 03:24:01,390
I'm too stupid for set routes, man.

4715
03:24:01,390 --> 03:24:03,210
I don't know what I'm doing.

4716
03:24:03,430 --> 03:24:05,350
I don't remember where the things are.

4717
03:24:18,830 --> 03:24:21,670
Yeah, people are just mad because some people...

4718
03:24:22,670 --> 03:24:23,190
Uh...

4719
03:24:24,490 --> 03:24:27,150
Some people got eliminated because of the announcement.

4720
03:24:28,070 --> 03:24:30,690
Yeah, some people literally are just...

4721
03:24:30,690 --> 03:24:32,910
Bam, clicking shit just for...

4722
03:24:32,910 --> 03:24:35,270
To test things out because they heard there was a rerun.

4723
03:24:35,450 --> 03:24:35,870
Yeah.

4724
03:24:36,170 --> 03:24:39,470
So, a lot of people lost a lot of points because of that.

4725
03:24:44,330 --> 03:24:48,310
The problem is that with 10 minutes hitting the prop, you gain 4 points while being a hunter.

4726
03:24:48,470 --> 03:24:48,890
Yeah.

4727
03:24:49,190 --> 03:24:50,150
Yeah, that's so true.

4728
03:24:50,350 --> 03:24:57,310
You gain more from being a hunter because like, as a prop, you only gain 4 points for surviving 10 minutes.

4729
03:24:58,670 --> 03:25:00,030
When a hunter can get...

4730
03:25:00,030 --> 03:25:00,730
You get 2 points.

4731
03:25:00,770 --> 03:25:01,630
You get 2 points for 5.

4732
03:25:01,630 --> 03:25:02,430
No, for 5 minutes.

4733
03:25:02,530 --> 03:25:02,910
Yeah.

4734
03:25:03,070 --> 03:25:04,770
And I didn't even get my 2 points from surviving 10 minutes.

4735
03:25:04,770 --> 03:25:05,330
I didn't either.

4736
03:25:05,710 --> 03:25:08,090
I survived 4 minutes at most.

4737
03:25:08,590 --> 03:25:09,930
Because there's just too many hunters.

4738
03:25:10,070 --> 03:25:12,830
By the time 4 minutes hit, there's just too many hunters.

4739
03:25:14,570 --> 03:25:15,330
And like...

4740
03:25:15,330 --> 03:25:18,490
Yo, whoever that is in the fucking general chat is sucking mad dick.

4741
03:25:18,690 --> 03:25:21,830
What do you mean you got eliminated and thought the event was fun?

4742
03:25:22,110 --> 03:25:24,270
Like the last game or the whole entire event?

4743
03:25:25,650 --> 03:25:27,810
I obviously thought that last game was fun.

4744
03:25:27,850 --> 03:25:28,710
You're pissing me off.

4745
03:25:28,850 --> 03:25:28,890
Pootlicker!

4746
03:25:30,910 --> 03:25:31,390
Dickrider!

4747
03:25:37,630 --> 03:25:40,530
That last game was not fun.

4748
03:25:40,710 --> 03:25:41,450
Don't lie.

4749
03:25:42,070 --> 03:25:42,810
That last game was not fun.

4750
03:25:42,830 --> 03:25:44,850
That last game was so frustrating.

4751
03:25:46,230 --> 03:25:48,170
The Twitch Rivals guy is typing.

4752
03:25:48,570 --> 03:25:49,690
Oh shit.

4753
03:25:55,150 --> 03:25:56,390
So funny.

4754
03:25:58,710 --> 03:25:59,870
There's no way.

4755
03:26:02,150 --> 03:26:04,210
I'm about to launch Poké Bro.

4756
03:26:06,210 --> 03:26:07,870
if I fucking give a fuck.

4757
03:26:07,990 --> 03:26:08,410
What the hell?

4758
03:26:09,610 --> 03:26:12,290
Guys, the Twitch Rivals person is...

4759
03:26:14,590 --> 03:26:16,070
It's typing now.

4760
03:26:18,490 --> 03:26:23,150
The thing is, if they say like eliminate all the people...

4761
03:26:23,900 --> 03:26:26,570
They're gonna have 30 really angry... Well, not 29.

4762
03:26:26,970 --> 03:26:28,470
No, 28 because I don't care anymore.

4763
03:26:28,670 --> 03:26:30,890
28 really angry streamers.

4764
03:26:31,170 --> 03:26:34,570
And I think like... I think Sapsnap is in it.

4765
03:26:38,990 --> 03:26:45,610
I think... I think Sap is like one of those 28 really angry players that got eliminated.

4766
03:26:46,870 --> 03:26:51,610
Because of the lack of clarity in the game mechanics of Pop-on, we've determined that the game did not work fairly.

4767
03:26:51,750 --> 03:26:55,730
We invite all players for today who participate in this game to join us tomorrow.

4768
03:26:56,070 --> 03:27:01,890
Tomorrow we will run three events starting with Doll Game and the 30 people who should have been eliminated will be eliminated then.

4769
03:27:03,290 --> 03:27:03,770
What?

4770
03:27:03,770 --> 03:27:06,050
So you're making us fucking get eliminated tomorrow?

4771
03:27:07,550 --> 03:27:08,810
I don't get it.

4772
03:27:08,890 --> 03:27:10,170
Like what are you saying?

4773
03:27:14,740 --> 03:27:15,260
What?

4774
03:27:15,320 --> 03:27:20,800
Run three games starting with the Doll Game and the 30 people who should have been eliminated will be eliminated then.

4775
03:27:21,020 --> 03:27:24,960
I guess like we're gonna play Doll Game and then we're gonna see who are the 30 people.

4776
03:27:25,780 --> 03:27:27,020
That are gonna...

4777
03:27:27,620 --> 03:27:28,460
That are gonna...

4778
03:27:28,460 --> 03:27:28,500
Okay.

4779
03:27:29,000 --> 03:27:30,280
I don't know.

4780
03:27:30,300 --> 03:27:30,340
What?

4781
03:27:30,340 --> 03:27:31,100
Doll Game!

4782
03:27:32,840 --> 03:27:34,020
That was so...

4783
03:27:34,020 --> 03:27:35,440
That was...

4784
03:27:35,720 --> 03:27:36,440
Oh my god.

4785
03:27:36,500 --> 03:27:36,940
I hate it.

4786
03:27:36,960 --> 03:27:38,480
I think I hate that game the most.

4787
03:27:38,600 --> 03:27:41,560
That game was so anxiety and anxiousness.

4788
03:27:41,920 --> 03:27:43,380
I think we should go sky.

4789
03:27:45,320 --> 03:27:46,660
We should go sky?

4790
03:27:47,320 --> 03:27:49,200
I think we go sky, Dokie.

4791
03:27:49,480 --> 03:27:50,120
What do you mean sky?

4792
03:27:50,480 --> 03:27:51,080
What does that mean?

4793
03:27:55,020 --> 03:27:56,140
I can't say it.

4794
03:27:56,820 --> 03:27:57,260
But...

4795
03:27:58,700 --> 03:27:59,380
Type it.

4796
03:28:02,380 --> 03:28:03,500
Alright, I'm gonna type it.

4797
03:28:04,400 --> 03:28:06,380
I think we should...

4798
03:28:24,780 --> 03:28:26,400
Oh my god.

4799
03:28:26,800 --> 03:28:27,500
Oh my god.

4800
03:28:27,500 --> 03:28:28,940
This game pisses me off.

4801
03:28:28,940 --> 03:28:30,660
Oh my god.

4802
03:28:32,810 --> 03:28:33,160
Yes.

4803
03:28:37,820 --> 03:28:39,180
Oh my god.

4804
03:28:39,680 --> 03:28:41,280
People are not happy.

4805
03:28:41,520 --> 03:28:44,500
Even though we're re-running because we have to come back tomorrow.

4806
03:28:44,880 --> 03:28:46,620
So people are not happy.

4807
03:28:46,620 --> 03:28:51,680
But there's one person that's extremely happy.

4808
03:28:52,320 --> 03:28:53,660
Yeah, I saw that shit.

4809
03:28:53,740 --> 03:28:54,080
I saw.

4810
03:28:55,300 --> 03:28:56,340
Do you know what I mean?

4811
03:28:56,380 --> 03:28:56,680
Let's go.

4812
03:28:56,780 --> 03:28:59,440
There is one person.

4813
03:28:59,440 --> 03:29:01,520
And it's the one person everyone knows.

4814
03:29:02,400 --> 03:29:04,920
Very happy right now.

4815
03:29:06,420 --> 03:29:07,020
Very happy.

4816
03:29:07,620 --> 03:29:08,720
Very happy.

4817
03:29:10,500 --> 03:29:11,700
Very happy.

4818
03:29:12,380 --> 03:29:13,000
Very happy.

4819
03:29:13,000 --> 03:29:14,540
Very happy.

4820
03:29:15,660 --> 03:29:16,260
Very happy.

4821
03:29:16,440 --> 03:29:18,480
If they didn't, they would have been eliminated.

4822
03:29:18,840 --> 03:29:19,540
And they...

4823
03:29:19,540 --> 03:29:23,380
I bet you Twitch staff did not want to piss him off.

4824
03:29:26,860 --> 03:29:28,140
Wait, they're kind of spitting.

4825
03:29:28,380 --> 03:29:29,160
Wait, hold on.

4826
03:29:29,200 --> 03:29:29,400
Pause.

4827
03:29:30,840 --> 03:29:32,660
The person typing in chat is kind of spitting.

4828
03:29:32,920 --> 03:29:33,480
Wait, why?

4829
03:29:33,720 --> 03:29:34,320
What did they say?

4830
03:29:35,100 --> 03:29:39,220
They think that the people who made it today should have to play.

4831
03:29:39,400 --> 03:29:40,800
And I kind of agree with that.

4832
03:29:41,000 --> 03:29:42,380
Yeah, I agree with that, honestly.

4833
03:29:42,580 --> 03:29:44,160
But the thing is they have to eliminate 30.

4834
03:29:44,160 --> 03:29:47,460
Or they cut the eliminations to, like, 15.

4835
03:29:48,660 --> 03:29:50,800
Well, then that one makes sense for the later games.

4836
03:29:50,920 --> 03:29:53,000
Because I think they, like, coded it specifically.

4837
03:29:56,080 --> 03:29:56,880
Where, um...

4838
03:29:59,340 --> 03:30:01,160
Where they're forced...

4839
03:30:02,600 --> 03:30:04,460
Sorry, I'm fucking playing Pocket Rogue right now.

4840
03:30:04,600 --> 03:30:08,600
Where they're forced to, um, have a set amount of people per day.

4841
03:30:08,720 --> 03:30:09,240
Yeah, oh, that's true.

4842
03:30:09,280 --> 03:30:09,860
Like, per lobby?

4843
03:30:10,440 --> 03:30:11,100
That's true.

4844
03:30:11,320 --> 03:30:11,560
Yeah.

4845
03:30:12,060 --> 03:30:13,440
What did AntVenom posted?

4846
03:30:13,440 --> 03:30:16,200
Someone told me to look at what AntVenom tweeted.

4847
03:30:17,280 --> 03:30:18,020
Didn't tweet at all.

4848
03:30:19,480 --> 03:30:20,900
Wait, they didn't tweet or say anything.

4849
03:30:21,260 --> 03:30:21,920
What do you mean?

4850
03:30:23,120 --> 03:30:24,580
Or did they say something in my chat?

4851
03:30:25,940 --> 03:30:30,060
Dude, I don't think AntVenom himself would go out of his way to go into your chat.

4852
03:30:30,300 --> 03:30:30,900
Yeah, I know.

4853
03:30:30,960 --> 03:30:32,580
That's why someone's like, look at what AntVenom...

4854
03:30:32,580 --> 03:30:34,160
What did they... I don't know what they said.

4855
03:30:34,760 --> 03:30:36,320
I was like, who's AntVenom?

4856
03:30:38,160 --> 03:30:40,640
Like, who... I don't even know who that is.

4857
03:30:44,720 --> 03:30:45,760
Oh, Megalol.

4858
03:30:51,060 --> 03:30:52,560
I was just like, who?

4859
03:30:57,220 --> 03:30:59,780
Oh my god, you see, like, people pulling up clips?

4860
03:31:04,320 --> 03:31:06,640
I do, I do see it.

4861
03:31:11,880 --> 03:31:13,460
Join our voice channel?

4862
03:31:13,520 --> 03:31:14,380
Oh my god.

4863
03:31:14,640 --> 03:31:14,840
No.

4864
03:31:15,100 --> 03:31:16,320
He's being taken.

4865
03:31:18,480 --> 03:31:19,240
Oh my god.

4866
03:31:19,660 --> 03:31:21,720
Wait, why are they taking this person?

4867
03:31:21,880 --> 03:31:23,280
Did this person complain a lot?

4868
03:31:23,780 --> 03:31:26,800
I think this person... this person wrote an entire...

4869
03:31:27,280 --> 03:31:31,760
Oh, that's the one that wrote, like, three paragraphs of why, like, it's justified to not rerun?

4870
03:31:32,020 --> 03:31:32,620
Yeah, yeah.

4871
03:31:32,620 --> 03:31:35,740
Like, the one that was like, was the game not fair?

4872
03:31:36,020 --> 03:31:36,460
Yes!

4873
03:31:37,020 --> 03:31:38,020
Oh, I remember that!

4874
03:31:38,020 --> 03:31:38,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

4875
03:31:45,460 --> 03:31:47,440
Oh my god, they're kidnapping them.

4876
03:31:47,700 --> 03:31:49,920
They're kidnapping them to talk in voice.

4877
03:31:51,640 --> 03:31:52,440
It's Jover.

4878
03:31:52,800 --> 03:31:54,420
It's so Jover.

4879
03:32:00,370 --> 03:32:02,510
Oh my god, people don't even want to play anymore.

4880
03:32:03,050 --> 03:32:07,870
People were like, like, this is messed up, I don't even want to play anymore.

4881
03:32:08,010 --> 03:32:09,930
I think they should just give us the money.

4882
03:32:10,310 --> 03:32:11,490
Honestly, yeah, just give us...

4883
03:32:12,150 --> 03:32:13,570
Dude, just spread it.

4884
03:32:13,910 --> 03:32:14,310
Yeah.

4885
03:32:14,670 --> 03:32:15,410
At this point.

4886
03:32:15,930 --> 03:32:19,530
I think that's the only thing that can make everybody happy, to spread the money.

4887
03:32:19,750 --> 03:32:20,410
Because, like...

4888
03:32:22,250 --> 03:32:23,350
I mean, if it's like...

4889
03:32:23,350 --> 03:32:23,810
We're winning nonetheless.

4890
03:32:24,330 --> 03:32:26,510
Yeah, like, just split from the 70k.

4891
03:32:28,310 --> 03:32:29,710
Because even so...

4892
03:32:30,350 --> 03:32:31,770
Like, they still get like...

4893
03:32:31,770 --> 03:32:33,590
Like, 30,000.

4894
03:32:33,670 --> 03:32:35,410
That's still a lot of money.

4895
03:32:36,790 --> 03:32:37,310
Yeah.

4896
03:32:37,790 --> 03:32:39,130
That's like the most...

4897
03:32:39,130 --> 03:32:41,590
That's like more than like, any other Twitch Rivals.

4898
03:32:43,690 --> 03:32:45,990
Or not even that, just give like 500 each.

4899
03:32:46,290 --> 03:32:47,030
That got eliminated.

4900
03:32:50,340 --> 03:32:53,400
No, the thing is, first place gets 70k chat.

4901
03:32:53,900 --> 03:32:54,720
That's the thing.

4902
03:32:54,940 --> 03:32:56,680
First place gets 70k.

4903
03:32:56,940 --> 03:32:58,180
So if they take like...

4904
03:32:58,180 --> 03:33:01,860
If they just give like 500 to like, all the remaining players that got eliminated.

4905
03:33:02,360 --> 03:33:04,520
Then like, at best, not even like...

4906
03:33:04,520 --> 03:33:05,600
They can still keep 50k.

4907
03:33:05,800 --> 03:33:06,160
Yeah.

4908
03:33:07,180 --> 03:33:08,340
Because each like...

4909
03:33:08,340 --> 03:33:10,080
The first place can at least keep 50k.

4910
03:33:10,180 --> 03:33:11,940
And that's still a lot of money.

4911
03:33:12,600 --> 03:33:14,220
50k is still a lot.

4912
03:33:17,940 --> 03:33:18,420
There's...

4913
03:33:18,420 --> 03:33:20,560
Oh my god, there's another thing.

4914
03:33:23,660 --> 03:33:24,280
There's more?

4915
03:33:26,360 --> 03:33:26,720
Dude...

4916
03:33:27,320 --> 03:33:28,800
I don't even want to look at that.

4917
03:33:29,040 --> 03:33:29,180
Wait.

4918
03:33:29,880 --> 03:33:30,680
Where's the more?

4919
03:33:33,260 --> 03:33:34,180
No, they're just typing.

4920
03:33:34,560 --> 03:33:35,060
Oh, no, no.

4921
03:33:35,140 --> 03:33:37,760
They're just saying, tomorrow run three events starting with a doll game.

4922
03:33:40,500 --> 03:33:41,420
I guess like...

4923
03:33:41,420 --> 03:33:42,800
I guess they meant like...

4924
03:33:44,720 --> 03:33:47,560
30 people would just be eliminated in general with a doll game.

4925
03:33:47,820 --> 03:33:49,060
God, a doll game was so stressful.

4926
03:33:49,180 --> 03:33:50,540
I feel like they definitely get a doll game.

4927
03:33:50,540 --> 03:33:53,880
I feel like it shouldn't be...

4928
03:33:53,880 --> 03:33:57,160
It should be like if you get a safe doll, you should be just safe automatically.

4929
03:34:00,400 --> 03:34:00,920
Sorry.

4930
03:34:01,020 --> 03:34:01,840
Do you see that?

4931
03:34:03,240 --> 03:34:04,700
I'm putting in the cake.

4932
03:34:05,440 --> 03:34:07,700
It puts all emojis right away.

4933
03:34:08,200 --> 03:34:11,100
That's so tone down.

4934
03:34:11,820 --> 03:34:12,860
That's so...

4935
03:34:15,670 --> 03:34:15,950
That's right.

4936
03:34:16,250 --> 03:34:18,110
That's like, read the room.

4937
03:34:20,430 --> 03:34:21,870
For context, basically...

4938
03:34:21,870 --> 03:34:30,450
Basically, in announcements, they add all of us and said, Don't forget that Twitch Rivals will be rating and gifting 25 subs to a lucky random channel at the end of the day.

4939
03:34:30,590 --> 03:34:32,150
Just make sure to be streaming.

4940
03:34:32,630 --> 03:34:34,310
Yeah, and then people...

4941
03:34:34,870 --> 03:34:39,510
People are mad right now because it's so...

4942
03:34:39,510 --> 03:34:41,690
It's so... oh my god.

4943
03:34:41,930 --> 03:34:47,510
And then people are reacting to it and putting like skull emoji and kek.

4944
03:34:47,610 --> 03:34:48,170
W.

4945
03:34:50,090 --> 03:34:53,810
Dude, the first thing I saw was a skull emoji right away after they posted it.

4946
03:34:53,830 --> 03:34:54,450
Yeah, yeah.

4947
03:34:54,750 --> 03:34:56,430
The skull emoji.

4948
03:34:56,790 --> 03:34:59,490
And someone reacted with the question mark.

4949
03:35:03,750 --> 03:35:07,310
Okay, whatever happens, not gonna lie, this was content.

4950
03:35:08,510 --> 03:35:10,370
No, it was good content.

4951
03:35:10,630 --> 03:35:12,310
Yeah, this is so... like...

4952
03:35:13,550 --> 03:35:16,790
It's so fun to see drama when you're not involved in it.

4953
03:35:16,910 --> 03:35:17,370
You know?

4954
03:35:18,830 --> 03:35:23,290
You get to watch at the sideline as everything's getting cooked right now.

4955
03:35:23,930 --> 03:35:26,830
I like how someone was like, please tell me where the last egg is.

4956
03:35:30,650 --> 03:35:32,610
Can you guys tell us where the last two eggs are?

4957
03:35:32,890 --> 03:35:34,590
Yeah, guys, do you know where the last two eggs are?

4958
03:35:34,770 --> 03:35:37,110
Well, if we weren't eliminated, we would tell you.

4959
03:35:41,010 --> 03:35:41,810
Wait, what?

4960
03:35:42,250 --> 03:35:43,270
Wait, that's messed up.

4961
03:35:43,290 --> 03:35:43,730
Do you see that?

4962
03:35:44,510 --> 03:35:44,730
What?

4963
03:35:44,770 --> 03:35:45,010
Where?

4964
03:35:45,050 --> 03:35:45,190
Where?

4965
03:35:45,350 --> 03:35:46,650
The dolls are ping-based.

4966
03:35:47,270 --> 03:35:50,130
So people get to spawn randomly in the same position during the whole...

4967
03:35:50,130 --> 03:35:51,850
So if you're closer, you can immediately get targeted.

4968
03:35:52,070 --> 03:35:54,590
So, like, if you have worse ping, you basically spawn late.

4969
03:35:55,390 --> 03:35:57,130
I got spawned in the same spot each time.

4970
03:35:57,290 --> 03:35:59,250
Yeah, I know that, but apparently, like...

4971
03:35:59,730 --> 03:36:00,130
Uh...

4972
03:36:00,910 --> 03:36:01,310
Uh...

4973
03:36:01,310 --> 03:36:03,770
If you have bad ping, you're closer to the doll.

4974
03:36:06,670 --> 03:36:07,890
That's actually messed up.

4975
03:36:07,910 --> 03:36:08,350
Wait, what?

4976
03:36:08,670 --> 03:36:10,170
That's so messed up.

4977
03:36:11,050 --> 03:36:12,550
I did not know that.

4978
03:36:17,340 --> 03:36:18,040
Yeah.

4979
03:36:18,840 --> 03:36:21,080
I literally pinged them.

4980
03:36:24,320 --> 03:36:26,240
Wait, what did... wait, what?

4981
03:36:26,380 --> 03:36:27,280
Wrong team chat.

4982
03:36:27,280 --> 03:36:30,720
I posted a fucking screen... screenshot of my Pokérogue.

4983
03:36:35,360 --> 03:36:36,940
Whoa, you're lagging!

4984
03:36:36,980 --> 03:36:37,280
Whoa!

4985
03:36:38,960 --> 03:36:40,360
You're lagging!

4986
03:36:40,620 --> 03:36:42,020
You're lagging!

4987
03:36:47,810 --> 03:36:49,810
Wait, 5UP made it in!

4988
03:36:49,930 --> 03:36:50,490
Oh, you know what?

4989
03:36:50,690 --> 03:36:51,270
Great.

4990
03:36:51,450 --> 03:36:52,290
Great for 5UP.

4991
03:36:52,350 --> 03:36:54,010
5UP made it in, but he's arguing...

4992
03:36:54,010 --> 03:36:56,230
He's representing the people that got eliminated.

4993
03:36:56,530 --> 03:36:59,650
Because he was mad that the chest was broken.

4994
03:37:01,410 --> 03:37:04,340
It's so funny!

4995
03:37:04,620 --> 03:37:07,500
Like, he made it, but, like, he's...

4996
03:37:07,500 --> 03:37:12,480
He's just... he's really mad at the chest being broken.

4997
03:37:12,920 --> 03:37:14,800
That he's fighting for us.

4998
03:37:16,000 --> 03:37:17,740
It's about the principles.

4999
03:37:18,540 --> 03:37:19,820
He's a real one.

5000
03:37:22,640 --> 03:37:23,220
Representing...

5001
03:37:23,220 --> 03:37:26,480
True, to be fair, to be fair, he would've had more points.

5002
03:37:26,860 --> 03:37:32,120
He could've... he could've had so much more points if that shit wasn't broken.

5003
03:37:33,680 --> 03:37:34,540
That's funny.

5004
03:37:35,160 --> 03:37:36,320
That's so funny.

5005
03:37:40,180 --> 03:37:42,140
Hey, someone's gotta represent us.

5006
03:37:42,300 --> 03:37:42,760
Yeah!

5007
03:37:43,020 --> 03:37:44,780
We're not even arguing, we're just watching.

5008
03:37:45,940 --> 03:37:49,160
I... I bet you they just didn't wanna make that person mad.

5009
03:37:52,130 --> 03:37:53,390
It's true!

5010
03:37:54,310 --> 03:37:55,090
Like...

5011
03:37:56,080 --> 03:37:57,830
Because he was really mad.

5012
03:38:03,350 --> 03:38:08,450
Because if you could've seen the... how mad he was.

5013
03:38:11,970 --> 03:38:12,750
Um...

5014
03:38:12,750 --> 03:38:14,360
Mr. Krabs!

5015
03:38:14,710 --> 03:38:15,770
Mr. Krabs!

5016
03:38:15,770 --> 03:38:16,950
I'm a Krabs!

5017
03:38:19,520 --> 03:38:22,680
Take the 30 eliminated people, have them compete in a separate game.

5018
03:38:23,100 --> 03:38:24,060
Okay, well...

5019
03:38:24,060 --> 03:38:24,300
Five?

5020
03:38:24,300 --> 03:38:25,900
People can't code that shit, man.

5021
03:38:25,980 --> 03:38:27,280
Yeah, they can't code that in time.

5022
03:38:28,100 --> 03:38:29,420
Use your noggin, man.

5023
03:38:29,820 --> 03:38:31,200
I guess they could do that for the dolls.

5024
03:38:35,080 --> 03:38:37,320
Someone said I got... wait, is Sylvie trolling?

5025
03:38:37,520 --> 03:38:40,260
There's no way you can get 47 points as a hunter!

5026
03:38:44,340 --> 03:38:45,460
Oh, over all the rounds.

5027
03:38:45,480 --> 03:38:46,680
Oh, she's also one of the hosts.

5028
03:38:46,740 --> 03:38:47,680
She's also a host.

5029
03:38:48,000 --> 03:38:48,240
Oh.

5030
03:38:53,130 --> 03:38:54,090
Wait, as a hunter?

5031
03:38:55,250 --> 03:38:55,590
Yeah.

5032
03:38:55,970 --> 03:38:57,490
Wait, how the heck did she get 47?

5033
03:38:58,630 --> 03:39:00,210
She probably was a hunter multiple rounds.

5034
03:39:00,990 --> 03:39:03,030
Wait, she got a hunter multiple rounds?

5035
03:39:04,330 --> 03:39:04,670
Probably.

5036
03:39:05,170 --> 03:39:06,770
Wait, I thought you could only get it once.

5037
03:39:06,950 --> 03:39:07,930
Wait, that's not fair.

5038
03:39:08,290 --> 03:39:08,350
No.

5039
03:39:09,030 --> 03:39:09,690
You can get...

5040
03:39:09,690 --> 03:39:11,710
Girl, that's what people were talking about!

5041
03:39:12,190 --> 03:39:12,550
Wait, I didn't realize!

5042
03:39:13,050 --> 03:39:15,530
I thought you'd be like, oh, you can get it once and you won't get it again.

5043
03:39:15,650 --> 03:39:16,770
But that's actually rigged!

5044
03:39:16,770 --> 03:39:17,810
If you can get double hunter!

5045
03:39:19,710 --> 03:39:20,370
Wait a minute!

5046
03:39:20,370 --> 03:39:21,590
Okay, now I'm mad.

5047
03:39:27,030 --> 03:39:28,130
Now I'm mad.

5048
03:39:30,250 --> 03:39:32,050
Now I'm gonna start piping.

5049
03:39:32,410 --> 03:39:34,070
Now I'm gonna be mad, too.

5050
03:39:36,830 --> 03:39:41,190
I went in and be like, well, at least you can get hunter only once if you do get it.

5051
03:39:41,390 --> 03:39:42,370
Girl, I got hunters, too!

5052
03:39:42,830 --> 03:39:45,110
You get multiple hunters?

5053
03:39:45,430 --> 03:39:47,310
Yeah, there's some people who got hunter multiple times.

5054
03:39:47,310 --> 03:39:49,130
What is this RNG?

5055
03:39:52,170 --> 03:39:54,170
Someone's like, Doki is typing now.

5056
03:39:58,390 --> 03:40:00,170
Did you see me tap up?

5057
03:40:00,810 --> 03:40:01,670
Hold on.

5058
03:40:02,050 --> 03:40:03,170
Wait, give me a second.

5059
03:40:04,490 --> 03:40:06,470
I think I should also finish.

5060
03:40:06,570 --> 03:40:07,290
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm pumped.

5061
03:40:07,390 --> 03:40:08,390
This is fun.

5062
03:40:08,590 --> 03:40:14,330
I think we should not rerun the game, but I think you should give us our money.

5063
03:40:16,190 --> 03:40:17,290
Wait, what?

5064
03:40:17,290 --> 03:40:18,050
Honestly?

5065
03:40:19,430 --> 03:40:28,270
Just re-divide the prizes and give 500 to the people that got eliminated.

5066
03:40:29,510 --> 03:40:30,190
Lemel.

5067
03:40:30,510 --> 03:40:35,810
I added Lemel there so people won't take it too seriously, but I'm sort of serious.

5068
03:40:40,310 --> 03:40:41,430
I'm not joking.

5069
03:40:43,110 --> 03:40:43,890
Hold on.

5070
03:40:43,910 --> 03:40:44,190
Don't worry.

5071
03:40:44,290 --> 03:40:44,730
I'll support you.

5072
03:40:44,750 --> 03:40:45,150
Wait.

5073
03:40:45,190 --> 03:40:45,930
She's cooking.

5074
03:40:46,390 --> 03:40:47,070
She's cooking.

5075
03:40:47,070 --> 03:40:47,270
She's cooking.

5076
03:40:51,970 --> 03:40:53,810
What are you...

5077
03:40:53,810 --> 03:40:55,750
I'm probably satisfied.

5078
03:40:55,810 --> 03:40:58,310
Got $500 for three days of this?

5079
03:40:58,810 --> 03:40:59,930
I'll take that.

5080
03:41:00,170 --> 03:41:02,230
I'm going to have to start from day one.

5081
03:41:05,390 --> 03:41:11,010
Oh my God!

5082
03:41:11,030 --> 03:41:11,390
Look!

5083
03:41:11,490 --> 03:41:12,410
Look at what's happening!

5084
03:41:12,890 --> 03:41:13,010
What?

5085
03:41:13,530 --> 03:41:14,090
Look!

5086
03:41:17,270 --> 03:41:19,370
People are mad about the copyright stuff.

5087
03:41:19,510 --> 03:41:24,010
To be fair, they like told people that, oh my god, he's calling...

5088
03:41:25,270 --> 03:41:28,630
Oh my god, look at this, he's calling and people are reacting.

5089
03:41:29,070 --> 03:41:32,990
Oh my god, he's calling people up for the music stuff.

5090
03:41:36,770 --> 03:41:39,950
If you guys go see them discord right now.

5091
03:41:42,170 --> 03:41:43,150
Mycrafters are fighting.

5092
03:41:43,350 --> 03:41:44,890
They're actually fighting.

5093
03:41:48,170 --> 03:41:49,410
They're fighting.

5094
03:41:49,730 --> 03:41:51,070
Somebody called...

5095
03:41:51,070 --> 03:41:51,650
Shakira, Shakira.

5096
03:41:51,950 --> 03:41:53,690
Somebody called out...

5097
03:41:53,690 --> 03:41:59,010
Somebody called out another Minecrafter for playing music and they responded, cry.

5098
03:42:04,590 --> 03:42:05,930
Oh my god.

5099
03:42:07,030 --> 03:42:07,890
Damn.

5100
03:42:13,760 --> 03:42:15,130
Oh my god.

5101
03:42:17,950 --> 03:42:19,230
That's actually crazy.

5102
03:42:19,430 --> 03:42:21,570
Holy shit, I'm enjoying this now.

5103
03:42:23,650 --> 03:42:24,130
What?

5104
03:42:24,310 --> 03:42:25,350
I'm down.

5105
03:42:26,110 --> 03:42:29,970
I'm down to keep going if I get to see stuff like this.

5106
03:42:30,950 --> 03:42:32,310
Fight, fight, fight.

5107
03:42:33,530 --> 03:42:34,490
Minecraft fight.

5108
03:42:35,150 --> 03:42:36,290
Take it to bed warriors.

5109
03:42:36,390 --> 03:42:38,170
They should just take it to the bed warriors to settle.

5110
03:42:40,530 --> 03:42:43,310
I think you guys should 1v1.

5111
03:42:43,510 --> 03:42:45,110
I think you guys should just take it.

5112
03:42:45,110 --> 03:42:46,150
Take it to the bed warriors.

5113
03:42:48,150 --> 03:42:49,870
I think you guys should take it to bed.

5114
03:42:50,650 --> 03:42:52,050
Who said that?

5115
03:42:52,310 --> 03:42:52,770
Who said that?

5116
03:42:53,290 --> 03:42:55,470
Some repressed rage there.

5117
03:42:59,840 --> 03:43:00,850
Oh my god.

5118
03:43:02,830 --> 03:43:03,950
Oh my god.

5119
03:43:04,820 --> 03:43:06,570
Just give us $500 each.

5120
03:43:07,490 --> 03:43:08,490
I'm satisfied.

5121
03:43:10,830 --> 03:43:11,450
$500.

5122
03:43:17,330 --> 03:43:18,370
Okay, guys.

5123
03:43:19,950 --> 03:43:21,870
I think Doki was right.

5124
03:43:24,630 --> 03:43:27,850
I think they should give us money.

5125
03:43:31,570 --> 03:43:32,230
That's all.

5126
03:43:33,670 --> 03:43:34,570
Tongue out emoji.

5127
03:43:38,090 --> 03:43:38,610
Bro.

5128
03:43:39,770 --> 03:43:41,990
I like how both of us, we don't care anymore.

5129
03:43:42,150 --> 03:43:44,070
Like just, we don't even want to come to day 4.

5130
03:43:44,070 --> 03:43:45,550
Just give us some money.

5131
03:43:46,130 --> 03:43:47,830
Just give us some money.

5132
03:43:53,220 --> 03:43:56,920
I think $500 per person is good.

5133
03:43:57,160 --> 03:43:59,300
$500 per person who got eliminated.

5134
03:43:59,700 --> 03:44:01,420
We already invested 3 days of this.

5135
03:44:02,280 --> 03:44:03,380
Yeah, suck my balls.

5136
03:44:03,620 --> 03:44:03,840
Yeah.

5137
03:44:05,140 --> 03:44:05,700
Yeah.

5138
03:44:05,820 --> 03:44:06,380
Yeah.

5139
03:44:06,520 --> 03:44:06,880
Yeah.

5140
03:44:07,800 --> 03:44:08,300
Yeah.

5141
03:44:10,540 --> 03:44:11,100
Yeah.

5142
03:44:11,560 --> 03:44:12,120
Yeah.

5143
03:44:12,120 --> 03:44:12,420
Oh, man.

5144
03:44:12,440 --> 03:44:14,540
If you guys could only see...

5145
03:44:15,700 --> 03:44:19,020
If you guys could only see the skirt fight.

5146
03:44:20,120 --> 03:44:21,940
It's actually so good.

5147
03:44:24,380 --> 03:44:25,840
I'd be mining.

5148
03:44:26,980 --> 03:44:29,640
I say revive everyone from the whole event.

5149
03:44:29,680 --> 03:44:31,280
Double the prize pool.

5150
03:44:31,880 --> 03:44:32,200
Sorry.

5151
03:44:34,100 --> 03:44:40,360
Instead of 70k, the first place player can get 140k.

5152
03:44:42,200 --> 03:44:45,800
Let's all donate and double the prize pool.

5153
03:44:49,080 --> 03:44:49,940
Oh, my God.

5154
03:44:49,960 --> 03:44:52,260
The ad was like, please feel free to log off.

5155
03:44:52,280 --> 03:44:54,980
We're continuing to discuss this and working.

5156
03:44:55,200 --> 03:44:56,600
Oh, they're still working on a solution.

5157
03:44:57,820 --> 03:44:59,300
Girl, is there no solution?

5158
03:44:59,480 --> 03:45:00,440
What's going on?

5159
03:45:01,000 --> 03:45:02,580
Bro, just end the tournament.

5160
03:45:02,980 --> 03:45:04,480
Just end the event.

5161
03:45:04,800 --> 03:45:05,660
Check us out already.

5162
03:45:05,780 --> 03:45:06,060
Yeah.

5163
03:45:06,520 --> 03:45:07,040
Yeah.

5164
03:45:07,140 --> 03:45:07,380
Yeah.

5165
03:45:07,380 --> 03:45:07,820
Yeah.

5166
03:45:10,100 --> 03:45:11,560
Amazon, we know you have a lot of money.

5167
03:45:11,640 --> 03:45:14,020
Just increase the prize pool and give us each all of us 3 money.

5168
03:45:14,020 --> 03:45:14,480
Amazon, please.

5169
03:45:14,800 --> 03:45:15,640
Amazon, please.

5170
03:45:16,860 --> 03:45:19,040
To be fair, Twitch is losing money every year.

5171
03:45:19,400 --> 03:45:20,700
If you guys didn't know that, chat.

5172
03:45:21,440 --> 03:45:23,720
Yeah, it's been in the negatives for like years now.

5173
03:45:23,820 --> 03:45:25,400
They have not been a profit, by the way.

5174
03:45:25,560 --> 03:45:31,020
I think like Twitch, like for Amazon, Twitch is like a, like what is it called?

5175
03:45:31,140 --> 03:45:32,600
A tax write-off type deal.

5176
03:45:33,300 --> 03:45:37,800
Like they know it doesn't profit, but like they're only doing it because it's a nice deal.

5177
03:45:37,800 --> 03:45:39,040
It's a nice tax write-off or something.

5178
03:45:39,400 --> 03:45:39,960
Yeah.

5179
03:45:43,060 --> 03:45:44,400
Yeah, I don't know what she said.

5180
03:45:45,240 --> 03:45:47,020
Yeah, it's like a vanity project.

5181
03:45:47,740 --> 03:45:48,840
A loss leader?

5182
03:45:49,140 --> 03:45:50,840
What does loss leader mean?

5183
03:45:51,120 --> 03:45:53,100
Guys, let's learn economics while people are fighting.

5184
03:45:53,100 --> 03:45:54,560
Dude, Tubbo just typed, can I get revived?

5185
03:45:58,620 --> 03:46:02,380
Yes, I think we should revive him.

5186
03:46:02,740 --> 03:46:05,040
Now that he said something, I agree.

5187
03:46:05,620 --> 03:46:06,580
Yeah, I agree.

5188
03:46:06,580 --> 03:46:08,500
I like unfairly took his spot.

5189
03:46:15,560 --> 03:46:17,160
Someone's like, is there a call going on?

5190
03:46:17,260 --> 03:46:18,180
Oh, they want in.

5191
03:46:18,340 --> 03:46:19,860
They want in on this.

5192
03:46:22,980 --> 03:46:26,320
Guys, I'm glad all of you guys like drama because I saw...

5193
03:46:26,320 --> 03:46:32,620
I don't know if it's the same for you, Gumi, but I actually had more people watching now just to know what the fuck is going on.

5194
03:46:33,180 --> 03:46:36,480
Just to know what the drama is like right now.

5195
03:46:40,140 --> 03:46:48,060
When people are watching the game over screen to know what's going on in the Minecraft wars.

5196
03:46:49,560 --> 03:46:51,380
I think I stopped them from talking.

5197
03:46:51,580 --> 03:46:52,160
I think...

5198
03:46:53,360 --> 03:46:53,800
No!

5199
03:46:54,440 --> 03:46:55,900
I don't want to get in a call.

5200
03:46:56,040 --> 03:46:57,720
Wait, but we get in a call and mute ourselves.

5201
03:46:57,840 --> 03:46:58,700
We can listen to the fight.

5202
03:46:59,980 --> 03:47:00,640
I know.

5203
03:47:01,120 --> 03:47:01,960
Oh my God.

5204
03:47:02,180 --> 03:47:03,880
I think it'd be like Worldstar.

5205
03:47:06,800 --> 03:47:07,460
Oh my God.

5206
03:47:07,480 --> 03:47:08,360
It's going to be like Worldstar.

5207
03:47:10,440 --> 03:47:11,380
I think people...

5208
03:47:11,380 --> 03:47:11,800
Oh my gosh.

5209
03:47:12,160 --> 03:47:13,940
Wait, what is he saying in Spanish?

5210
03:47:14,580 --> 03:47:15,100
Deep L?

5211
03:47:15,240 --> 03:47:15,900
Deep L-ing is?

5212
03:47:16,480 --> 03:47:17,140
Deep L-ing?

5213
03:47:17,280 --> 03:47:17,780
We're going...

5214
03:47:17,780 --> 03:47:18,620
See you tomorrow.

5215
03:47:18,620 --> 03:47:19,760
See you tomorrow.

5216
03:47:19,760 --> 03:47:20,300
Don't see me tomorrow.

5217
03:47:20,300 --> 03:47:20,320
Geez.

5218
03:47:24,380 --> 03:47:29,200
Oh my God.

5219
03:47:32,980 --> 03:47:34,680
Yeah, it's just a see you tomorrow.

5220
03:47:34,680 --> 03:47:38,240
I like how like everybody that was arguing mostly...

5221
03:47:39,120 --> 03:47:40,220
Shut the fuck up.

5222
03:47:40,400 --> 03:47:40,800
What?

5223
03:47:41,540 --> 03:47:42,980
They all shut the fuck up now.

5224
03:47:43,080 --> 03:47:43,740
Oh, no, no, no, no.

5225
03:47:43,760 --> 03:47:46,020
I meant like it was all in English.

5226
03:47:46,660 --> 03:47:47,380
Oh my God.

5227
03:47:47,400 --> 03:47:48,000
They're beefing.

5228
03:47:48,000 --> 03:47:48,560
They're beefing.

5229
03:47:48,560 --> 03:47:48,720
Look.

5230
03:47:48,820 --> 03:47:49,040
Wait, what?

5231
03:47:49,140 --> 03:47:49,520
Look.

5232
03:47:49,820 --> 03:47:50,220
Look.

5233
03:47:50,420 --> 03:47:50,680
Look.

5234
03:47:52,700 --> 03:47:54,140
Your takes were not good.

5235
03:47:54,320 --> 03:47:55,700
Can I join a voice chat?

5236
03:47:55,860 --> 03:47:56,840
Oh my God.

5237
03:47:56,860 --> 03:47:57,500
They're going to fight.

5238
03:48:04,430 --> 03:48:05,550
Oh my God.

5239
03:48:05,630 --> 03:48:07,210
They're going to go to voice chat, guys.

5240
03:48:07,550 --> 03:48:07,950
Oh my God.

5241
03:48:12,170 --> 03:48:12,570
I'm not going to be able to do anything.

5242
03:48:12,950 --> 03:48:13,350
Goddamn.

5243
03:48:13,590 --> 03:48:14,510
Use your words.

5244
03:48:14,730 --> 03:48:15,410
Use your...

5245
03:48:15,410 --> 03:48:17,070
Talk to me in person.

5246
03:48:17,650 --> 03:48:18,050
No.

5247
03:48:18,450 --> 03:48:19,830
Don't use your fucking...

5248
03:48:21,170 --> 03:48:22,070
Don't type to me.

5249
03:48:22,110 --> 03:48:22,810
Don't type to me.

5250
03:48:22,870 --> 03:48:23,070
You people are warriors.

5251
03:48:23,270 --> 03:48:24,110
See if you can say it.

5252
03:48:24,170 --> 03:48:26,130
Look me in the eye and say it to my face.

5253
03:48:27,390 --> 03:48:28,690
Turn webcam on.

5254
03:48:34,340 --> 03:48:38,640
Turn the webcam off and look me in the eye and talk to me like that.

5255
03:48:40,400 --> 03:48:40,800
Can we just stop?

5256
03:48:41,100 --> 03:48:41,580
I don't feel so good.

5257
03:48:44,860 --> 03:48:47,080
Bro, are they going to a different point?

5258
03:48:47,140 --> 03:48:52,940
Bro, are they going to a different Minecraft server to talk?

5259
03:48:53,660 --> 03:48:55,120
Wait, that's so funny.

5260
03:48:55,180 --> 03:48:55,800
Do you see that?

5261
03:48:56,020 --> 03:48:58,620
They're not even going to use this server.

5262
03:48:59,060 --> 03:49:01,320
Do you know what that stands for?

5263
03:49:01,540 --> 03:49:01,700
What?

5264
03:49:02,400 --> 03:49:06,700
Oh man, it's like Ultimate Hardcore or something.

5265
03:49:08,100 --> 03:49:08,900
Oh my god.

5266
03:49:08,960 --> 03:49:10,360
It stands for Hardcore Minecrafters.

5267
03:49:10,360 --> 03:49:11,820
Oh my god.

5268
03:49:11,960 --> 03:49:14,240
It's like an exclusive Minecraft server.

5269
03:49:14,600 --> 03:49:17,480
An exclusive Minecraft server voice chat.

5270
03:49:17,780 --> 03:49:20,520
Guys, they're not even going to argue in this server.

5271
03:49:20,660 --> 03:49:23,740
They're taking it to the Ultimate Hardcore Minecraft server.

5272
03:49:24,020 --> 03:49:27,300
With all the Ultimate Hardcore players to duke it out.

5273
03:49:32,600 --> 03:49:33,960
That's crazy.

5274
03:49:34,800 --> 03:49:36,780
That's actually crazy.

5275
03:49:37,620 --> 03:49:40,120
They're going to the... to the like...

5276
03:49:40,360 --> 03:49:42,560
This rank Minecraft server.

5277
03:49:43,440 --> 03:49:46,320
The fight is not for us peasants.

5278
03:49:47,600 --> 03:49:48,780
Oh my god.

5279
03:49:48,820 --> 03:49:50,420
They're not even going to let us watch?

5280
03:49:51,000 --> 03:49:51,340
They're not?

5281
03:49:51,340 --> 03:49:51,740
I know!

5282
03:49:53,040 --> 03:49:54,440
What are they tired of?

5283
03:49:54,480 --> 03:49:57,520
Tell Aunt Frost to give us an invite right now.

5284
03:49:58,960 --> 03:50:00,400
Tell Aunt Frost.

5285
03:50:01,220 --> 03:50:03,520
We want to listen in.

5286
03:50:03,840 --> 03:50:05,280
It's not fair.

5287
03:50:06,400 --> 03:50:08,040
The content we're missing.

5288
03:50:08,040 --> 03:50:09,160
I want to know the tea.

5289
03:50:09,360 --> 03:50:10,400
Let me in.

5290
03:50:14,400 --> 03:50:15,820
I can't believe it.

5291
03:50:15,860 --> 03:50:18,460
The offscreen Goku vs Frieza.

5292
03:50:20,980 --> 03:50:21,660
Oh my god.

5293
03:50:21,680 --> 03:50:22,420
He sent me an invite.

5294
03:50:25,320 --> 03:50:25,760
Okay.

5295
03:50:25,840 --> 03:50:25,940
Okay.

5296
03:50:25,940 --> 03:50:26,140
Okay.

5297
03:50:26,560 --> 03:50:28,060
Oh my god.

5298
03:50:30,200 --> 03:50:30,640
Guys.

5299
03:50:30,640 --> 03:50:31,080
Guys.

5300
03:50:31,140 --> 03:50:33,240
We're in the Ultimate Hardcore server.

5301
03:50:34,740 --> 03:50:35,180
Wait.

5302
03:50:35,280 --> 03:50:35,980
I don't have a roll.

5303
03:50:36,400 --> 03:50:37,000
I don't have a roll.

5304
03:50:37,800 --> 03:50:39,220
Give me a roll.

5305
03:50:41,520 --> 03:50:42,340
Oh my god.

5306
03:50:42,420 --> 03:50:42,640
Bro.

5307
03:50:43,680 --> 03:50:44,080
Bro.

5308
03:50:44,240 --> 03:50:47,100
I see all the Minecraft players, guys.

5309
03:50:48,260 --> 03:50:49,280
Oh my god.

5310
03:50:50,900 --> 03:50:52,960
They gave us a roll just to like...

5311
03:50:53,660 --> 03:50:56,280
Just to look at the weight here.

5312
03:50:56,720 --> 03:50:57,860
We have no roll.

5313
03:50:58,300 --> 03:50:59,960
We have no roll so we can't see.

5314
03:50:59,960 --> 03:51:00,700
He's the owner of the server.

5315
03:51:00,880 --> 03:51:03,600
He's literally the owner of the server.

5316
03:51:04,060 --> 03:51:05,140
Give me a fucking roll.

5317
03:51:05,320 --> 03:51:06,040
Give us a roll.

5318
03:51:06,180 --> 03:51:07,360
Give us a roll right now.

5319
03:51:07,400 --> 03:51:08,140
We want to listen.

5320
03:51:08,620 --> 03:51:10,240
We want to listen to this fight.

5321
03:51:11,460 --> 03:51:11,820
Guys.

5322
03:51:12,580 --> 03:51:13,380
We're so cool.

5323
03:51:13,380 --> 03:51:13,680
Guys.

5324
03:51:13,840 --> 03:51:18,180
We're so cool that we're in the Ultimate Hardcore Minecraft server.

5325
03:51:18,240 --> 03:51:18,420
I'm in.

5326
03:51:18,660 --> 03:51:18,920
Wait.

5327
03:51:19,020 --> 03:51:19,120
Wait.

5328
03:51:19,140 --> 03:51:19,480
What about me?

5329
03:51:19,520 --> 03:51:20,060
I'm not in yet.

5330
03:51:20,100 --> 03:51:20,500
I'm not in.

5331
03:51:21,760 --> 03:51:22,060
No.

5332
03:51:22,080 --> 03:51:22,820
They gave me a roll too.

5333
03:51:23,000 --> 03:51:23,480
It's because you're offline.

5334
03:51:23,700 --> 03:51:24,260
It's because you're offline.

5335
03:51:24,320 --> 03:51:24,640
Okay.

5336
03:51:24,740 --> 03:51:24,880
Okay.

5337
03:51:24,920 --> 03:51:25,800
The rare online.

5338
03:51:26,040 --> 03:51:27,220
The rare online moment.

5339
03:51:27,340 --> 03:51:27,540
I'm here.

5340
03:51:27,720 --> 03:51:30,500
Can you give Noki the roll too?

5341
03:51:30,580 --> 03:51:31,240
She has a lot to say about this.

5342
03:51:31,240 --> 03:51:34,360
I just want you to know I haven't been online for three months.

5343
03:51:34,480 --> 03:51:35,300
Or not three months.

5344
03:51:35,320 --> 03:51:35,900
For like...

5345
03:51:35,900 --> 03:51:36,240

Okay.

5347
03:51:39,960 --> 03:51:40,280

But we can't talk to each other.

5351
03:51:45,880 --> 03:51:46,000
Yeah.

5352
03:51:46,000 --> 03:51:46,240
It's okay.

5353
03:51:46,260 --> 03:51:46,580
We can type.

5354
03:51:46,680 --> 03:51:46,920
We can type.

5355
03:51:48,180 --> 03:51:48,500
Okay.

5356
03:51:48,540 --> 03:51:48,720
Okay.

5357
03:51:48,720 --> 03:51:49,120

5358
03:51:49,180 --> 03:51:49,440
Yeah.

5359
03:51:49,480 --> 03:51:49,580
Yeah.

5360
03:51:49,580 --> 03:51:49,760
Yeah.

5361
03:51:49,760 --> 03:51:49,920
Yeah.

5362
03:51:50,260 --> 03:51:50,580
Okay.

5368
03:51:55,500 --> 03:51:55,840
Wait.

03:51:55,860 --> 03:51:56,900
I'm not in yet.

5370
03:51:56,940 --> 03:51:57,580
I don't have a roll yet.

5371
03:51:58,120 --> 03:51:59,360
I told him to give me a roll.

5372
03:52:00,240 --> 03:52:00,560
Oh.

5373
03:52:00,720 --> 03:52:01,040
Wait.

5374
03:52:01,140 --> 03:52:01,860
What about my roll?

5375
03:52:03,180 --> 03:52:03,500
Bitch.

5376
03:52:03,500 --> 03:52:04,680
I told him to give him a roll.

5377
03:52:04,720 --> 03:52:05,700
You just have to wait.

5378
03:52:05,900 --> 03:52:06,600
I just have to wait?

5379
03:52:06,600 --> 03:52:08,400
We're missing information right now.

5380
03:52:08,500 --> 03:52:08,920
We're missing information.

5381
03:52:08,920 --> 03:52:08,940
Okay.

5382
03:52:08,940 --> 03:52:09,000
Okay.

5383
03:52:09,080 --> 03:52:09,380
Okay.

5384
03:52:09,380 --> 03:52:10,120
You type me the info.

5385
03:52:10,220 --> 03:52:10,960
I'll read it out the chat.

5386
03:52:11,280 --> 03:52:11,640
Okay.

5387
03:52:11,640 --> 03:52:12,000
Okay.

5388
03:52:12,000 --> 03:52:13,220
I'll wait like one minute.

5389
03:52:13,280 --> 03:52:14,760
If he doesn't give me a roll, I'm gonna yell at you.

5390
03:52:15,440 --> 03:52:15,800
Okay.

5391
03:52:15,820 --> 03:52:16,520

Okay.

5397
03:52:18,860 --> 03:52:20,620
Gumi is gonna give us the insider knowledge.

5398
03:52:20,920 --> 03:52:22,420
I still don't have a roll yet.

5399
03:52:22,620 --> 03:52:25,020
I still... I still don't have...

5400
03:52:26,200 --> 03:52:26,920
We're roll...

5401
03:52:28,200 --> 03:52:28,560
Sad.

5402
03:52:32,740 --> 03:52:35,640
They're talking about the spawn spots.

5403
03:52:35,640 --> 03:52:36,340
They're talking about the spawn spots.

5404
03:52:40,540 --> 03:52:42,320
They're actually beefing.

5405
03:52:44,080 --> 03:52:46,600
I need to know.

5406
03:52:47,160 --> 03:52:47,980
Oh my god.

5407
03:52:48,000 --> 03:52:50,140
They're actually beefing.

5408
03:52:59,360 --> 03:53:03,040
I'm missing a good beefing content.

5409
03:53:10,320 --> 03:53:12,380
I can't believe it.

5410
03:53:12,380 --> 03:53:14,780
I can't believe it.

5411
03:53:14,780 --> 03:53:16,740
Minecraft streamers are wild.

5412
03:53:17,000 --> 03:53:19,700
Bro, apparently they're actually arguing.

5413
03:53:20,440 --> 03:53:21,860
Oh my god.

5414
03:53:21,980 --> 03:53:24,540
They're talking about spawn spots.

5415
03:53:25,040 --> 03:53:26,680
What the heck does that mean?

5416
03:53:32,260 --> 03:53:34,360
Oh my god.

5417
03:53:34,460 --> 03:53:34,640
Okay.

5418
03:53:34,640 --> 03:53:35,340
Okay guys.

5419
03:53:35,800 --> 03:53:36,760
We're gonna...

5420
03:53:36,760 --> 03:53:38,060
We don't have the roll yet.

5421
03:53:38,160 --> 03:53:39,960
So I'm gonna steal Gumi's content right now.

5422
03:53:42,520 --> 03:53:43,080
Guys.

5423
03:53:43,820 --> 03:53:45,320
I'm gonna steal Gumi's content.

5424
03:53:50,650 --> 03:53:53,130
What the heck is this nerd talk?

5425
03:54:01,390 --> 03:54:02,610
Oh my god.

5426
03:54:10,100 --> 03:54:11,220
What the heck?

5427
03:54:15,860 --> 03:54:17,160
Oh my god.

5428
03:54:21,700 --> 03:54:22,260
Oh

5429
03:54:31,120 --> 03:54:31,200
my god.

5430
03:54:31,460 --> 03:54:31,860
Guys.

5431
03:54:31,880 --> 03:54:32,560
I got the roll.

5432
03:54:32,740 --> 03:54:33,100
Guys.

5433
03:54:33,100 --> 03:54:33,100
I got the roll.

5434
03:54:33,100 --> 03:54:34,040
No more stealing content.

5435
03:54:34,280 --> 03:54:34,800
I got the roll.

5436
03:54:35,100 --> 03:54:35,280
Okay.

5437
03:54:35,360 --> 03:54:35,800
I'm going in.

5438
03:54:35,840 --> 03:54:36,160
I'm going in.

5439
03:54:36,300 --> 03:54:37,100
I'm going in.

5440
03:54:37,480 --> 03:54:38,380
I'm going in.

5441
03:54:39,600 --> 03:54:40,000
I'm going in.

5442
03:54:40,260 --> 03:54:40,800
I'm going in.

5443
03:54:41,120 --> 03:54:41,520
I'm going in.

5444
03:54:41,520 --> 03:54:41,580
I'm going in.

5445
03:54:41,580 --> 03:54:41,620
I'm going in.

5446
03:54:41,620 --> 03:54:41,780
I'm going in.

5447
03:54:41,940 --> 03:54:42,560
I'm going in.

5448
03:54:42,980 --> 03:54:43,840
I'm going in.

5449
03:54:45,800 --> 03:54:47,080
I'm going in.

5450
03:54:48,780 --> 03:54:49,580
I'm going in.

5451
03:54:53,740 --> 03:54:55,520
I'm going in.

5452
03:54:56,020 --> 03:54:58,840
There's 17 people in this car!

5453
03:54:59,700 --> 03:55:02,340
Yo, sorry to interrupt,

5454
03:55:06,600 --> 03:55:09,620
but you guys should probably read what someone said.

5455
03:55:09,880 --> 03:55:11,540
Don't read it out loud.

5456
03:55:11,960 --> 03:55:13,300
Don't read it out loud.

5457
03:55:13,500 --> 03:55:15,840
You should read it.

5458
03:55:15,920 --> 03:55:17,500
That would, like, yeah.

5459
03:55:18,340 --> 03:55:18,740
Wait, what?

5460
03:55:19,840 --> 03:55:20,440
Hashtag VC.

5461
03:55:22,180 --> 03:55:25,060
No, I don't want the world to look at that.

5462
03:55:25,060 --> 03:55:25,360
Wait, do I?

5463
03:55:26,100 --> 03:55:27,240
Yeah, I figured.

5464
03:55:28,900 --> 03:55:30,280
That's what I was thinking as well.

5465
03:55:30,540 --> 03:55:31,540
Yeah, I figured as much.

5466
03:55:33,160 --> 03:55:34,000
Oh my god.

5467
03:55:34,540 --> 03:55:38,100
I just feel like eliminating 30 people off a mad RNG game is a bit crazy.

5468
03:55:39,080 --> 03:55:41,940
Isn't that the same thing in the Rock, Paper, Scissors game we played?

5469
03:55:42,080 --> 03:55:43,480
No, they can't hear me.

5470
03:55:43,500 --> 03:55:44,500
I muted myself on Discord.

5471
03:55:45,040 --> 03:55:46,600
I muted myself on Discord, guys.

5472
03:55:46,740 --> 03:55:48,080
You can stack a group with your friends.

5473
03:55:48,200 --> 03:55:50,640
I think a lot of people walk in the same circles with their friends.

5474
03:55:50,700 --> 03:55:51,500
But it's RNG.

5475
03:55:51,980 --> 03:55:54,480
I had an alliance of maybe five, six people.

5476
03:55:55,060 --> 03:56:00,160
If you queue into your friends, you can 100% trust them.

5477
03:56:00,220 --> 03:56:02,360
Versus maybe other people who don't queue into their friends at all.

5478
03:56:02,460 --> 03:56:03,060
How is that fair?

5479
03:56:04,280 --> 03:56:05,540
I'm not saying it's fair.

5480
03:56:05,860 --> 03:56:07,140
Here's the best thing I can say about that.

5481
03:56:07,280 --> 03:56:10,360
You're allowed to hear it because other people are showing it.

5482
03:56:11,000 --> 03:56:14,480
Other people are showing the nerd fight right now.

5483
03:56:14,560 --> 03:56:16,320
They just lied to me on the last round.

5484
03:56:16,520 --> 03:56:17,860
We're meant to hear this.

5485
03:56:19,040 --> 03:56:20,840
Everyone else is streaming the scum.

5486
03:56:22,040 --> 03:56:22,720
That's the game.

5487
03:56:22,720 --> 03:56:25,240
I was never a hunter and I still survived.

5488
03:56:26,300 --> 03:56:28,880
Bro, is this what Minecraft players talk about?

5489
03:56:29,220 --> 03:56:30,500
Is this what they argue about?

5490
03:56:30,840 --> 03:56:32,480
The argument there is that it's random.

5491
03:56:32,660 --> 03:56:33,880
What I'm saying there is...

5492
03:56:33,880 --> 03:56:38,960
Bro, if this was an FPS game right now, I'm going to say it.

5493
03:56:39,080 --> 03:56:44,120
If this was an FPS game and there's disagreements, this is going to be...

5494
03:56:44,120 --> 03:56:45,760
It would be so much less civil.

5495
03:56:46,940 --> 03:56:48,540
Again, another six seconds.

5496
03:56:48,880 --> 03:56:52,260
FPS gamers will start saying the most fun stuff.

5497
03:56:52,260 --> 03:56:53,400
Fucked up shit.

5498
03:56:53,800 --> 03:56:55,200
I don't have to play the game anymore.

5499
03:56:55,340 --> 03:56:57,640
It's a different way to play the entire round.

5500
03:56:57,700 --> 03:56:58,580
I get a free pass.

5501
03:56:58,760 --> 03:56:59,400
Other people don't.

5502
03:56:59,740 --> 03:57:03,280
This is actually like a nerd fight right now.

5503
03:57:05,220 --> 03:57:07,480
It's different because that's the mechanic of the game.

5504
03:57:07,560 --> 03:57:10,820
The mechanic of the game is that you can lie to each other and do that to try and get points.

5505
03:57:10,920 --> 03:57:12,680
Whereas with this, there was no mechanic of the game.

5506
03:57:12,760 --> 03:57:15,360
If you got hunter round one, you did not have to play the rest of the rounds.

5507
03:57:15,420 --> 03:57:16,880
You could have just killed everyone the first round.

5508
03:57:16,960 --> 03:57:19,540
I feel like we shouldn't be arguing about...

5509
03:57:19,540 --> 03:57:21,240
I got hunter round one.

5510
03:57:21,240 --> 03:57:22,320
This is so civilized.

5511
03:57:22,840 --> 03:57:25,660
This is an actual debate club right now.

5512
03:57:26,320 --> 03:57:29,620
No, I've seen Apex and a lot of people argue.

5513
03:57:32,380 --> 03:57:33,500
Nerd fight.

5514
03:57:35,960 --> 03:57:39,300
I'm arguing that there were ugly things happening that...

5515
03:57:39,300 --> 03:57:41,180
This is an actual argument.

5516
03:57:41,460 --> 03:57:42,700
Okay, but the question is...

5517
03:57:43,240 --> 03:57:46,620
I think we all agree that we see this shit, right?

5518
03:57:46,680 --> 03:57:49,300
Because it's like, bro, I was lowkey thinking that.

5519
03:57:49,300 --> 03:57:50,900
You could look at past games and say that.

5520
03:57:50,920 --> 03:57:51,020
You could look at past games and say that.

5521
03:57:51,240 --> 03:57:53,560
Where are we drawing the line on what games get rerun?

5522
03:57:54,340 --> 03:57:58,800
I've seen fucked up shit when Apex and Overwatch gamers start arguing.

5523
03:57:59,020 --> 03:58:02,620
When FPS gamers start arguing, it's actually so messed up.

5524
03:58:02,720 --> 03:58:06,100
They get real personal unga bunga.

5525
03:58:08,460 --> 03:58:10,360
I feel like I'm in a debate club.

5526
03:58:10,960 --> 03:58:16,140
Here's my thing is that this game, there was a lot more factors that were completely RNG.

5527
03:58:16,200 --> 03:58:19,020
If you spawned on the east wing, you spawned next to all three paintings.

5528
03:58:19,240 --> 03:58:20,900
And so you could just run to all three paintings immediately.

5529
03:58:20,900 --> 03:58:23,640
And get 10 points, 15 points, however many points it was.

5530
03:58:23,980 --> 03:58:24,920
Just for the paintings.

5531
03:58:25,720 --> 03:58:27,960
I'm gonna up the volume so you guys can hear the argument better.

5532
03:58:28,100 --> 03:58:29,820
That's five points that you can get if someone has spawned on the west side.

5533
03:58:29,880 --> 03:58:32,580
By the time they run to the east side, the hunters are coming out of the door killing them.

5534
03:58:33,040 --> 03:58:35,860
So there is no balance in the idea of...

5535
03:58:36,280 --> 03:58:39,440
There's more randomness, but we're saying that that's just not a good argument to rerun.

5536
03:58:40,080 --> 03:58:41,420
I'm not saying we should rerun.

5537
03:58:41,520 --> 03:58:42,140
Let me make that clear.

5538
03:58:42,300 --> 03:58:43,960
I guess I should clarify my stance.

5539
03:58:44,020 --> 03:58:45,540
I'm not even saying that it should be rerun.

5540
03:58:45,640 --> 03:58:46,360
I'm not saying that's the solution.

5541
03:58:46,420 --> 03:58:47,900
I'm saying that game should have never been played, right?

5542
03:58:48,180 --> 03:58:48,460
Exactly.

5543
03:58:49,000 --> 03:58:49,280
Yeah.

5544
03:58:49,280 --> 03:58:51,900
That's the only take that is actually real, I think.

5545
03:58:51,980 --> 03:58:54,600
That game was completely unbalanced and it shouldn't have been played.

5546
03:58:55,620 --> 03:58:59,080
On the first round, a hunter got 25 points.

5547
03:58:59,320 --> 03:59:01,580
And that's just an example of one hunter on the first round.

5548
03:59:01,580 --> 03:59:01,880
Right.

5549
03:59:02,000 --> 03:59:02,960
In a single round.

5550
03:59:03,220 --> 03:59:03,760
That's guaranteed.

5551
03:59:04,400 --> 03:59:04,800
100%.

5552
03:59:05,400 --> 03:59:06,540
That's only five kills.

5553
03:59:06,960 --> 03:59:10,260
One thing I'm saying about that is sure the hunting was OP.

5554
03:59:10,960 --> 03:59:11,780
But let's be honest.

5555
03:59:11,820 --> 03:59:15,140
When we were all sitting there and looking at the points, we all knew that the hunting side was OP.

5556
03:59:15,600 --> 03:59:16,000
Right.

5557
03:59:16,320 --> 03:59:17,600
Everyone knew the hunting was going to be OP.

5558
03:59:17,960 --> 03:59:18,880
Bro, this is great.

5559
03:59:19,280 --> 03:59:20,420
I'm glad I made it to day three.

5560
03:59:20,500 --> 03:59:21,220
We knew it.

5561
03:59:21,440 --> 03:59:23,580
I'm so happy I made it to day three.

5562
03:59:24,240 --> 03:59:27,420
The biggest argument though is yes, we know the hunter is OP.

5563
03:59:27,520 --> 03:59:29,180
There's not much you can do about that.

5564
03:59:30,160 --> 03:59:34,820
But if the hunter is so OP and the task isn't working.

5565
03:59:35,600 --> 03:59:36,000
Yeah.

5566
03:59:36,100 --> 03:59:38,800
Then the survivors are playing at such a huge deficit at that point.

5567
03:59:38,800 --> 03:59:39,000
What's going on?

5568
03:59:39,660 --> 03:59:41,660
That's a goddamn nerd fight.

5569
03:59:41,740 --> 03:59:42,260
That's what?

5570
03:59:43,160 --> 03:59:45,960
You can't run the game with the survivors already at a disadvantage.

5571
03:59:45,960 --> 03:59:46,340
Okay.

5572
03:59:46,340 --> 03:59:46,640
I'll show you guys.

5573
03:59:46,920 --> 03:59:48,680
Actually, I want to show you guys how many people.

5574
03:59:48,700 --> 03:59:49,160
There's a lot.

5575
03:59:49,160 --> 03:59:49,260
There's a lot.

5576
03:59:49,280 --> 03:59:50,480
There's a lot of people in this god.

5577
03:59:50,580 --> 03:59:57,760
Because if you spawn at the middle chest, the turning one, for me personally, which I spawn twice, fiddled with it for a solid like minute, does not work for me.

5578
03:59:57,860 --> 03:59:59,300
So you can't have that as an argument.

5579
04:00:00,360 --> 04:00:06,120
And so if I spawn there and then I just lose the advantage because now I'm at like, what, 20 seconds to find the other tasks and then the hunters just beeline it.

5580
04:00:06,220 --> 04:00:08,460
Bro, is this what being in a Minecraft community is like?

5581
04:00:08,540 --> 04:00:08,980
You can't have that.

5582
04:00:08,980 --> 04:00:09,780
People fight like this?

5583
04:00:09,900 --> 04:00:10,800
And so I'm just fucked now.

5584
04:00:11,720 --> 04:00:13,460
You don't need to talk about anything else.

5585
04:00:13,480 --> 04:00:13,880
You're not allowed to.

5586
04:00:13,920 --> 04:00:14,360
You're in Minecraft.

5587
04:00:14,640 --> 04:00:16,680
All the fiddle of like the time and everything doesn't matter.

5588
04:00:16,740 --> 04:00:19,080
The only thing that actually matters is if the game is good or bad.

5589
04:00:19,080 --> 04:00:19,260
You're not allowed to.

5590
04:00:19,260 --> 04:00:19,620
That's the only buggy.

5591
04:00:20,060 --> 04:00:21,400
Is this every day for them?

5592
04:00:21,440 --> 04:00:21,660
That's the only good thing.

5593
04:00:21,720 --> 04:00:23,540
It doesn't matter how unbalanced anything is.

5594
04:00:23,620 --> 04:00:25,260
It doesn't matter how left or right anything happens.

5595
04:00:25,400 --> 04:00:32,060
If things work for some players and don't work for other players and they're doing the same inputs and the same everything, that's, that's what I can give up.

5596
04:00:32,260 --> 04:00:33,700
That's just the only thing that makes sense.

5597
04:00:33,700 --> 04:00:35,660
Nothing else about the balancing matters at all.

5598
04:00:35,760 --> 04:00:37,020
Everyone's going into the same game.

5599
04:00:37,280 --> 04:00:40,540
If it just genuinely doesn't work, then that's the only thing that makes sense.

5600
04:00:40,540 --> 04:00:41,240
Can I just call to the call?

5601
04:00:41,340 --> 04:00:42,000
Because he has good takes.

5602
04:00:42,680 --> 04:00:42,940
Who?

5603
04:00:43,400 --> 04:00:43,780
Yes, Kyle.

5604
04:00:44,720 --> 04:00:48,040
He's adding another person to argue?!

5605
04:00:48,040 --> 04:00:49,240
Like the problem was...

5606
04:00:49,240 --> 04:00:51,580
The problem with the tomorrow is like one thing that's going to happen is, um...

5607
04:00:51,580 --> 04:00:52,520
Bro, did you hear that?

5608
04:00:52,580 --> 04:00:53,640
Bro, can we add the other guy?

5609
04:00:53,720 --> 04:00:54,520
He has some good points.

5610
04:00:54,520 --> 04:00:55,100
You know how at the end of the last game, right?

5611
04:00:55,940 --> 04:00:58,820
Or the dull, dull, whatever stupid name it was.

5612
04:00:58,840 --> 04:01:00,260
Another fighter has joined the lobby.

5613
04:01:00,260 --> 04:01:03,760
You know how when we got it down to just one color, it did the same thing where it just kind of spawned somewhere?

5614
04:01:04,360 --> 04:01:10,100
If we had to eliminate six people that last round and there's only one color and it spawned Bro, I'm the only non-Minecraft person in this call.

5615
04:01:10,500 --> 04:01:11,120
You know what I mean?

5616
04:01:11,160 --> 04:01:13,160
This is like a whole new world for us, guys.

5617
04:01:13,400 --> 04:01:13,820
The solution's fixed.

5618
04:01:14,820 --> 04:01:18,000
It would have been so random if you spawned in front of it, like randomly.

5619
04:01:18,480 --> 04:01:19,280
That's a strategy.

5620
04:01:19,340 --> 04:01:19,820
That's a strategy.

5621
04:01:19,940 --> 04:01:20,960
Here comes a new challenger.

5622
04:01:21,000 --> 04:01:23,420
No, if you don't know where you're spawning and you just randomly spawn in front of it.

5623
04:01:23,420 --> 04:01:25,240
I'm literally like the fly on the wall right now.

5624
04:01:25,560 --> 04:01:26,780
No, what I'm saying, what I'm saying.

5625
04:01:26,860 --> 04:01:33,440
What I'm saying is, you know how when it got to the end of the game and there was like only one color left, right?

5626
04:01:34,020 --> 04:01:35,400
Can someone give a roll?

5627
04:01:35,560 --> 04:01:39,980
It just kind of just put it down somewhere and you didn't really get to choose.

5628
04:01:40,020 --> 04:01:43,800
Like, it just kind of ended up spawning in front of you because it was only one color left.

5629
04:01:44,320 --> 04:01:50,960
So imagine like the last round of tomorrow when you just randomly spawned in front of You need to get rid of six people and it just spawns right in front of you.

5630
04:01:51,040 --> 04:01:52,080
Like, that's just unlucky.

5631
04:01:54,100 --> 04:01:59,280
My argument, my only argument for that is there is the safe zones, which I'm hoping they would put more in.

5632
04:01:59,360 --> 04:02:00,200
And then that's a strategy.

5633
04:02:00,260 --> 04:02:01,060
Run to the safe zone.

5634
04:02:01,300 --> 04:02:01,920
Oh my God.

5635
04:02:02,020 --> 04:02:04,840
Why are they strategizing now?

5636
04:02:06,720 --> 04:02:08,420
You can't use that as an argument at all.

5637
04:02:08,460 --> 04:02:12,660
The only thing that I can get by at all, there's two things that the admins did wrong.

5638
04:02:12,720 --> 04:02:14,040
And it's just, this is an objective fact.

5639
04:02:14,120 --> 04:02:15,340
There's two things that they did wrong.

5640
04:02:15,380 --> 04:02:16,200
It's an objective fact?

5641
04:02:16,200 --> 04:02:17,860
That would cause the game to have to be replayed.

5642
04:02:17,860 --> 04:02:17,980
Okay.

5643
04:02:18,000 --> 04:02:18,540
The objective fact?

5644
04:02:18,540 --> 04:02:21,780
As if there was genuine bugs affecting people playing, that stuff didn't work.

5645
04:02:21,920 --> 04:02:23,240
And they were doing the same things with other people.

5646
04:02:23,240 --> 04:02:23,400
Like, let me show you the participants.

5647
04:02:23,440 --> 04:02:24,320
I'm just checking stuff.

5648
04:02:24,420 --> 04:02:24,660
Okay.

5649
04:02:24,760 --> 04:02:28,360
There were things that maybe some people could do on low ping, but other people couldn't do on high ping and they didn't test it.

5650
04:02:28,520 --> 04:02:29,640
That is valid.

5651
04:02:29,800 --> 04:02:37,460
The only other thing that's valid is they canceled it in the middle of the fourth game and some people trolled in their heads knowing that it was going to be canceled because that's what they said.

5652
04:02:37,580 --> 04:02:38,720
And now they're going to walk it back.

5653
04:02:38,820 --> 04:02:39,540
Those are the only two things.

5654
04:02:39,700 --> 04:02:42,100
Every RNG argument, we're not going to get anywhere.

5655
04:02:42,660 --> 04:02:44,200
There's no point in even talking about it.

5656
04:02:44,300 --> 04:02:46,260
Every single game you will ever play, ever.

5657
04:02:46,380 --> 04:02:47,500
In any game.

5658
04:02:47,500 --> 04:02:47,980
We're not going to get anywhere.

5659
04:02:48,000 --> 04:02:49,440
In Minecraft, it's going to be RNG.

5660
04:02:49,880 --> 04:02:57,100
Half of the games in this event were made to have RNG in them because they wanted it to be fair to the lower placing players.

5661
04:02:57,320 --> 04:02:58,660
That's why there's RNG factors.

5662
04:02:59,020 --> 04:03:07,240
The whole entire point of this event was to maybe see like some random like VTuber versus Feinberg in the final.

5663
04:03:07,400 --> 04:03:07,820
That's me!

5664
04:03:07,840 --> 04:03:08,820
That was the whole entire point.

5665
04:03:08,840 --> 04:03:11,800
If you run back hunt and run 10 times, I think our staff gets the final point.

5666
04:03:11,800 --> 04:03:13,580
That's me on the random VTuber!

5667
04:03:13,640 --> 04:03:14,440
Oh my god!

5668
04:03:14,500 --> 04:03:17,420
If you run this game 10 times, I don't think you see the same person in the final two once.

5669
04:03:18,060 --> 04:03:19,840
I just don't think it's going to happen.

5670
04:03:19,960 --> 04:03:20,600
So that's the point.

5671
04:03:20,660 --> 04:03:21,900
It's designed like that.

5672
04:03:22,000 --> 04:03:30,280
So there's the RNG argument literally has no like stake, no impact on anything because it's the point of the event.

5673
04:03:30,300 --> 04:03:31,280
You're talking about me!

5674
04:03:31,380 --> 04:03:32,440
It's the point of any game.

5675
04:03:33,020 --> 04:03:36,500
I think that argument changes my mind because I was against you on this.

5676
04:03:36,580 --> 04:03:42,820
I think that the RNG, like the balance of the game was for a $100,000 event.

5677
04:03:44,920 --> 04:03:45,840
That's my argument.

5678
04:03:46,020 --> 04:03:46,980
That was despicable.

5679
04:03:46,980 --> 04:03:47,440
Yeah.

5680
04:03:47,840 --> 04:03:51,140
To put $70,000 on the line and then make you play that game.

5681
04:03:51,140 --> 04:03:51,480
Exactly.

5682
04:03:51,980 --> 04:03:53,700
It's for sure not fair to people.

5683
04:03:53,740 --> 04:03:55,620
I don't think anyone disagrees with that take.

5684
04:03:56,900 --> 04:04:05,360
All these games we've been playing, like I go into it just being like, I could just randomly, like that curse one, I could randomly just spawn with it and everyone just runs away from me.

5685
04:04:05,400 --> 04:04:06,900
Like what was I supposed to do at that point?

5686
04:04:07,020 --> 04:04:07,300
Right.

5687
04:04:07,420 --> 04:04:07,640
Yeah.

5688
04:04:08,040 --> 04:04:08,940
There's a lot of these games.

5689
04:04:08,940 --> 04:04:12,140
Now they're doing the doll game, which to me was...

5690
04:04:13,480 --> 04:04:13,840
Exactly.

5691
04:04:14,440 --> 04:04:14,800
100%.

5692
04:04:14,800 --> 04:04:15,680
That's me!

5693
04:04:15,720 --> 04:04:16,180
That's me!

5694
04:04:16,460 --> 04:04:16,820
That's me!

5695
04:04:16,980 --> 04:04:25,240
I think the best solution out of all of this, like it sucks to say, calculate the points of the people who got fucked over and then just move the people on, move the fucking top 40 scores.

5696
04:04:25,560 --> 04:04:31,860
Because at the end of the day, like I think running it back, I mean, you guys saw the thing in VC, like running it back isn't really the best idea.

5697
04:04:32,120 --> 04:04:32,240
Yeah.

5698
04:04:32,380 --> 04:04:32,420
Yeah.

5699
04:04:32,420 --> 04:04:32,620
Yeah.

5700
04:04:32,620 --> 04:04:32,640
Yeah.

5701
04:04:32,640 --> 04:04:32,780
Yeah.

5702
04:04:32,780 --> 04:04:32,940
Yeah.

5703
04:04:32,940 --> 04:04:32,980
Yeah.

5704
04:04:32,980 --> 04:04:33,280
Yeah.

5705
04:04:33,280 --> 04:04:33,300
Yeah.

5706
04:04:33,300 --> 04:04:33,460
Yeah.

5707
04:04:33,460 --> 04:04:33,760
Yeah.

5708
04:04:33,760 --> 04:04:35,760
I'm a lower class compared to the minecrafters.

5709
04:04:36,440 --> 04:04:36,520
No matter what people are going to be fucked over, right?

5710
04:04:36,540 --> 04:04:47,200
So I think the best thing you can do, like the best thing you can do in this situation is just calculate the points because obviously there are people that got fucked over like through and like all those people.

5711
04:04:47,200 --> 04:04:48,700
I'm in the thick of the Minecraft drama.

5712
04:04:48,940 --> 04:04:50,140
Like there was bugs, right?

5713
04:04:50,200 --> 04:05:00,320
But it's not like the, the way they make it sound is like, it's only one person experienced a bug or one different person experienced something or like five like a set of people I had the checkbook and you all laughed at me because you thought I fucked up.

5714
04:05:00,320 --> 04:05:01,380
We were all given the same thing.

5715
04:05:01,400 --> 04:05:02,820
We were all given the same.

5716
04:05:02,900 --> 04:05:03,740
That is not true.

5717
04:05:03,740 --> 04:05:04,760
We were all given the same idea.

5718
04:05:04,760 --> 04:05:06,380
You all laughed at me.

5719
04:05:07,540 --> 04:05:12,300
So the best thing that they can do is just count the scores, get a bunch of people and count the scores.

5720
04:05:12,380 --> 04:05:13,220
I don't, I don't agree.

5721
04:05:13,540 --> 04:05:14,880
Cause you thought it was possible.

5722
04:05:14,940 --> 04:05:22,840
I don't agree because there's multiple people, like I said, if I, if the only argument that you guys are going to listen to, it's still the biggest argument.

5723
04:05:23,040 --> 04:05:25,020
There's a fundamental flaw with one of the tasks.

5724
04:05:25,160 --> 04:05:27,240
People couldn't get points, which they need a survivor.

5725
04:05:27,980 --> 04:05:30,800
And therefore they're probably getting eliminated because they didn't get hunter.

5726
04:05:30,920 --> 04:05:32,100
That is fundamentally just.

5727
04:05:33,200 --> 04:05:34,880
There's nothing to it other than that.

5728
04:05:35,160 --> 04:05:39,460
Do we have a disadvantage that you literally couldn't do and then you lose.

5729
04:05:40,140 --> 04:05:42,240
And I don't think that's fair for a tournament setting.

5730
04:05:42,460 --> 04:05:42,820
I agree.

5731
04:05:42,880 --> 04:05:43,120
I agree.

5732
04:05:43,260 --> 04:05:47,240
We never had the same chance of rolling hunter and everybody has the same disadvantage.

5733
04:05:47,880 --> 04:05:47,900
No, it's not about that.

5734
04:05:47,900 --> 04:05:49,240
It's not about the hunter, it's about the thing not working.

5735
04:05:49,240 --> 04:05:49,980
It's not the same disadvantage.

5736
04:05:50,100 --> 04:05:52,500
That's an awful argument to say you had a disadvantage of thing breaking.

5737
04:05:52,640 --> 04:05:53,700
Some people's it worked.

5738
04:05:53,800 --> 04:05:54,280
All right.

5739
04:05:54,300 --> 04:05:56,100
If it works for some people, it should work for everybody.

5740
04:05:56,340 --> 04:05:57,500
So that's a terrible argument.

5741
04:05:57,980 --> 04:05:58,340
Right.

5742
04:05:58,440 --> 04:06:00,700
I also think that the RNG argument is a bit flawed too.

5743
04:06:00,780 --> 04:06:00,980
Yeah.

5744
04:06:02,100 --> 04:06:19,960
The RNG argument is way different because if you RNG and happen to be a hunter, then now congratulations, you can easily rack up 20 to 30 points this round by being a hunter the entire game while other people would never have the opportunity to do that no matter when they die or when they became a hunter or how many points they tried to get while they were as a prop.

5745
04:06:20,080 --> 04:06:21,940
You can never get that number of points.

5746
04:06:21,940 --> 04:06:23,100
Do I have any Minecraft viewers?

5747
04:06:23,400 --> 04:06:24,720
How long do these arguments last?

5748
04:06:25,180 --> 04:06:26,480
Yeah, but that's the point of the event.

5749
04:06:26,500 --> 04:06:28,200
Because they already sort of figured it out.

5750
04:06:28,380 --> 04:06:29,180
No, but it's not supposed to be...

5751
04:06:29,180 --> 04:06:30,220
I do understand that argument.

5752
04:06:30,300 --> 04:06:30,480
Okay.

5753
04:06:30,500 --> 04:06:30,740
I do.

5754
04:06:30,740 --> 04:06:31,460
I do understand.

5755
04:06:31,640 --> 04:06:32,080
I do understand.

5756
04:06:32,080 --> 04:06:35,280
Like, I understand the RNG is bad and the game is bad.

5757
04:06:35,920 --> 04:06:37,560
As someone in here that like...

5758
04:06:38,260 --> 04:06:39,800
How long do these arguments go?

5759
04:06:39,800 --> 04:06:42,720
If it was full skill-based, I should be in the top 20, right?

5760
04:06:42,800 --> 04:06:44,100
I'm like, sure, whatever.

5761
04:06:44,260 --> 04:06:44,400
Right?

5762
04:06:44,440 --> 04:06:47,220
Like, I'm not looking forward to playing these games, right?

5763
04:06:47,280 --> 04:06:52,880
Like, I'm not looking forward to getting random targeted by a doll, random spawn with a Guys, some of them make like actual spreadsheets because they're speedrunners.

5764
04:06:53,080 --> 04:06:53,300
Random not choosing a hunter.

5765
04:06:53,400 --> 04:06:53,980
Like, I didn't give them the throw for once.

5766
04:06:53,980 --> 04:06:55,700
Minecraft speedrunners are on a whole nother level.

5767
04:06:56,000 --> 04:06:57,880
It's a mix of RNG and skill.

5768
04:06:57,980 --> 04:07:00,680
People qualify being prop all four times.

5769
04:07:00,780 --> 04:07:02,060
And I guarantee you there were people who didn't.

5770
04:07:02,080 --> 04:07:07,480
There were people that were hunter starting that didn't qualify starting as hunter and then propping three times.

5771
04:07:07,600 --> 04:07:10,760
I'm willing to guarantee you could add, like, you'd have to look at every VOD, right?

5772
04:07:10,880 --> 04:07:21,300
But there's just, there's just no, like, I would honestly, I would, I would put money onto the fact that whoever got hunter first round probably made it through.

5773
04:07:22,540 --> 04:07:23,320
That's so true.

5774
04:07:23,440 --> 04:07:23,800
I agree.

5775
04:07:24,260 --> 04:07:26,940
The 90% minimum got through.

5776
04:07:27,140 --> 04:07:27,240
Yeah.

5777
04:07:27,320 --> 04:07:27,520
Yeah.

5778
04:07:27,520 --> 04:07:29,500
Oh, didn't you start us on their first round of zero points?

5779
04:07:29,580 --> 04:07:29,860
Yeah.

5780
04:07:29,860 --> 04:07:31,440
I started off as hunter.

5781
04:07:31,480 --> 04:07:31,860
First round.

5782
04:07:32,080 --> 04:07:32,280
I got 20.

5783
04:07:32,380 --> 04:07:33,320
And the second round I got zero.

5784
04:07:33,560 --> 04:07:36,060
And then second, third round I think I got, like, five.

5785
04:07:36,400 --> 04:07:37,700
And then the last one I think I got, like, five.

5786
04:07:37,720 --> 04:07:39,120
Yeah, but you started as hunter and got 20 points.

5787
04:07:39,200 --> 04:07:40,140
You started as hunter and got 20.

5788
04:07:40,200 --> 04:07:44,420
You got more points than I got the entire game as hunter in a single round.

5789
04:07:44,680 --> 04:07:47,260
The reason I got more points is because, like, I was just stealing people's kills.

5790
04:07:47,720 --> 04:07:48,000
Yeah.

5791
04:07:48,040 --> 04:07:48,980
It's still getting a kill.

5792
04:07:49,000 --> 04:07:49,280
Right.

5793
04:07:49,820 --> 04:07:50,100
Exactly.

5794
04:07:50,340 --> 04:07:51,520
You were still getting kills though.

5795
04:07:51,580 --> 04:07:51,860
Right.

5796
04:07:52,000 --> 04:07:52,280
Exactly.

5797
04:07:52,860 --> 04:07:55,140
And then there was a cool down for you to get kills.

5798
04:07:55,220 --> 04:07:55,740
No matter what.

5799
04:07:55,960 --> 04:08:00,600
There was two rounds I could have got, like, 15 points as the hunter, but I only got five because you're on a cool down for a minute.

5800
04:08:00,720 --> 04:08:01,460
So, like, I don't know.

5801
04:08:02,080 --> 04:08:02,600
I don't want to start the hunter conversation.

5802
04:08:02,900 --> 04:08:03,940
Again, like...

5803
04:08:03,940 --> 04:08:05,160
They should do bedwars right now.

5804
04:08:05,280 --> 04:08:05,480
This is a bedwars settlement.

5805
04:08:05,480 --> 04:08:07,460
...wholeheartedly with the whole, like, things not working.

5806
04:08:07,560 --> 04:08:17,040
The hunter topic is just fundamentally flawed because at the end of the day, we all knew before the event... the game started that hunting would be everyone's best chance of surviving.

5807
04:08:17,840 --> 04:08:18,240
And...

5808
04:08:18,240 --> 04:08:18,600
Yep.

5809
04:08:18,820 --> 04:08:19,960
We just got unlucky.

5810
04:08:20,260 --> 04:08:20,840
And, like...

5811
04:08:20,840 --> 04:08:21,140
What's the general...

5812
04:08:21,140 --> 04:08:21,740
I was annoyed...

5813
04:08:22,180 --> 04:08:22,820
I got unlucky...

5814
04:08:22,820 --> 04:08:25,080
What's the general consensus for, like, what should happen?

5815
04:08:25,380 --> 04:08:26,400
Man, they're actually constructed.

5816
04:08:26,400 --> 04:08:27,080
Well, the biggest problem...

5817
04:08:27,080 --> 04:08:29,260
Let's just keep it kind of straight, more or less.

5818
04:08:29,660 --> 04:08:31,960
Ninety percent of the people that are...

5819
04:08:32,800 --> 04:08:42,240
We're in the 40% are probably gonna be like yeah Let's just eliminate them and then most of the 90% of the 30 people are gonna say the same thing No, let's just do something again.

5820
04:08:42,400 --> 04:08:45,000
Like no matter what like people are gonna be mad

5821
04:09:07,460 --> 04:09:13,660
It depends on what the next games are cuz I don't think playing the doll game again is also a good solution No, I agree.

5822
04:09:13,820 --> 04:09:23,600
That's my biggest gripe with the solution is like I don't like I'm like the audience right now I have no idea what's going on in the Minecraft area Very common

5823
04:09:45,640 --> 04:09:57,240
I would hate to be eliminated from the game if it came down to me not being able to do the chest twice Even though I was there and had time to do it

5824
04:10:02,020 --> 04:10:06,460
I mean, that's something they could do, but have people report it individually and show the clip.

5825
04:10:07,420 --> 04:10:14,900
If you got scuffed by that lag or by that glitch, have you send them a clip and then do the calculation based off of that.

5826
04:10:15,180 --> 04:10:21,620
But there's still the fourth round, where people trolled because they thought it was getting restarted.

5827
04:10:21,760 --> 04:10:24,420
Okay, but there was only two props left.

5828
04:10:24,680 --> 04:10:26,980
Oh man, you guys should have seen the Discord.

5829
04:10:27,240 --> 04:10:30,820
The Discord peep, like the chat peep, was actually crazy.

5830
04:10:30,820 --> 04:10:32,580
It was insane.

5831
04:10:38,820 --> 04:10:45,400
They're so civilized in the voice call, but the Discord fight was insane.

5832
04:10:45,900 --> 04:10:47,920
When they're typing, it was so bad.

5833
04:10:48,140 --> 04:10:50,440
People were actually fighting in the chat.

5834
04:10:51,700 --> 04:10:53,380
Someone literally responded.

5835
04:10:53,700 --> 04:10:58,100
Someone called somebody out, and then the person responded with cry.

5836
04:10:58,500 --> 04:11:00,100
I was like, what?

5837
04:11:00,820 --> 04:11:01,060
That's stupid.

5838
04:11:01,280 --> 04:11:02,140
Tell us now.

5839
04:11:02,200 --> 04:11:03,060
Let us know.

5840
04:11:03,360 --> 04:11:05,680
We'll look at your bots and give you back your normal points.

5841
04:11:05,840 --> 04:11:07,120
And if you would have made it, you would have made it.

5842
04:11:07,180 --> 04:11:13,200
I think the only, if you're trying to make it the most balanced quote-on-quote, which I still think is not balanced because the game is flawed.

5843
04:11:13,460 --> 04:11:20,540
But the most balanced would be if you genuinely got bugged, either by not getting points for survival or the chest not working.

5844
04:11:21,220 --> 04:11:22,100
What's going on?

5845
04:11:22,220 --> 04:11:24,160
We're watching a Minecraft fight right now.

5846
04:11:24,160 --> 04:11:24,760
I don't know which ones.

5847
04:11:24,940 --> 04:11:27,000
We're listening into a Minecraft fight.

5848
04:11:27,100 --> 04:11:28,960
Sure, submitting a clip and having them do all the calculations.

5849
04:11:28,960 --> 04:11:32,260
I guess is, in theory, the most fair way to do it.

5850
04:11:32,320 --> 04:11:32,480
Sure.

5851
04:11:32,640 --> 04:11:34,880
Now, it's still not fair.

5852
04:11:35,120 --> 04:11:35,700
I'm getting Christian.

5853
04:11:36,380 --> 04:11:43,160
At the end of the day, this is a Minecraft new challenger is here.

5854
04:11:43,200 --> 04:11:45,260
I feel like we still had a good four minutes left.

5855
04:11:45,480 --> 04:11:47,240
But there was like two people alive.

5856
04:11:47,680 --> 04:11:49,620
If you found the person, like, PG.

5857
04:11:49,900 --> 04:11:51,300
Play the fourth round again, and that's it.

5858
04:11:51,360 --> 04:11:53,520
If you had to play the fourth round again, you just couldn't count that round.

5859
04:11:53,520 --> 04:11:58,060
But you can't do that because now everyone's going to know the rest and just look at bots.

5860
04:11:58,060 --> 04:11:59,820
Just stop it before that round.

5861
04:11:59,940 --> 04:12:01,680
Oh, sorry, before they said it.

5862
04:12:01,740 --> 04:12:02,880
Before they announced it.

5863
04:12:02,960 --> 04:12:04,920
Just those two people that were left as props.

5864
04:12:05,900 --> 04:12:07,000
They're still going.

5865
04:12:07,020 --> 04:12:08,180
Apparently this lasts for a while.

5866
04:12:09,140 --> 04:12:10,360
I don't know.

5867
04:12:10,620 --> 04:12:12,740
Is this what it feels like to be a reaction channel?

5868
04:12:12,860 --> 04:12:14,560
But I'm reacting to stuff live?

5869
04:12:15,120 --> 04:12:16,280
Bro, I'm patient zero.

5870
04:12:18,020 --> 04:12:21,100
I'm here, like, I'm in the drama.

5871
04:12:21,500 --> 04:12:23,580
No, all 30 people have to get eliminated.

5872
04:12:26,160 --> 04:12:28,040
It's not 30 people going into the doll game.

5873
04:12:28,040 --> 04:12:29,020
30 people have to get eliminated.

5874
04:12:29,300 --> 04:12:30,300
Everyone goes into the doll game.

5875
04:12:30,300 --> 04:12:35,360
If they change their mind and, like, send the 30 eliminations into doll game and let in...

5876
04:12:35,360 --> 04:12:37,280
Oh, shit, did people leak the Discord chats?

5877
04:12:39,560 --> 04:12:41,040
Wait, what got leaked?

5878
04:12:41,300 --> 04:12:43,780
Eventually the games tomorrow won't work for those people.

5879
04:12:43,880 --> 04:12:44,300
Oh, my God.

5880
04:12:44,580 --> 04:12:47,600
Are the Latin American streamers mad?

5881
04:12:48,140 --> 04:12:49,080
Oh, my God.

5882
04:12:49,100 --> 04:12:50,060
Are they farting?

5883
04:12:50,720 --> 04:12:53,880
Wait, was it a Latin American streamer that called out...

5884
04:12:53,880 --> 04:12:55,080
Oh, my God.

5885
04:12:56,800 --> 04:12:57,960
Oh, my God.

5886
04:13:07,360 --> 04:13:08,200
Oh, my God.

5887
04:13:08,520 --> 04:13:09,240
Oh, my God.

5888
04:13:09,540 --> 04:13:11,460
Oh, my God.

5889
04:13:11,620 --> 04:13:12,380
Oh, my God.

5890
04:13:12,900 --> 04:13:13,820
Oh, my God.

5891
04:13:13,820 --> 04:13:14,180
Oh, my God.

5892
04:13:15,640 --> 04:13:16,240
Oh!

5893
04:13:20,540 --> 04:13:26,360
You can't give up a spamming chat and someone's going to stop being the most annoying.

5894
04:13:26,360 --> 04:13:32,260
You can't add points to that because that happens to people who survived and then it's just like...

5895
04:13:32,260 --> 04:13:33,740
We saw that!

5896
04:13:33,860 --> 04:13:35,660
That was like one of the shoes top!

5897
04:13:36,000 --> 04:13:42,780
I think it should be added if people stand clicked and lost all their points at the end and also the hiding bonus.

5898
04:13:43,300 --> 04:13:44,700
Because that's literally...

5899
04:13:47,480 --> 04:13:49,260
The chat has a free combo code.

5900
04:13:51,960 --> 04:13:55,420
I lost five points to that and I still...

5901
04:13:56,620 --> 04:13:58,700
A lot of people that are arguing qualified in this.

5902
04:13:58,780 --> 04:13:59,720
It's more of just like...

5903
04:13:59,720 --> 04:14:00,120
Yeah, exactly.

5904
04:14:00,620 --> 04:14:02,480
Everyone that's putting on one side...

5905
04:14:02,480 --> 04:14:04,920
I don't want to guess, but I'm going to guess.

5906
04:14:05,080 --> 04:14:06,240
Sam, did you not qualify?

5907
04:14:07,040 --> 04:14:07,400
What?

5908
04:14:07,520 --> 04:14:07,920
Oh, no, no.

5909
04:14:07,960 --> 04:14:08,640
I got eliminated.

5910
04:14:09,280 --> 04:14:12,900
I'm just saying, you're on the opposite side.

5911
04:14:13,200 --> 04:14:14,160
Obviously, you're going to walk.

5912
04:14:15,000 --> 04:14:15,360
No, no.

5913
04:14:17,260 --> 04:14:19,380
That's why 90% are going to say both sides.

5914
04:14:19,740 --> 04:14:21,920
The thing is, you're saying that.

5915
04:14:21,920 --> 04:14:24,020
I actually don't think the game should be replayed at all.

5916
04:14:24,040 --> 04:14:25,400
I don't think that should happen.

5917
04:14:25,420 --> 04:14:26,540
I think that makes no sense.

5918
04:14:26,720 --> 04:14:31,520
I don't even know if they should try and do all this shenanigary where they try and fix the eliminations or whatever.

5919
04:14:31,660 --> 04:14:32,600
I don't think that's correct.

5920
04:14:33,400 --> 04:14:34,780
You were just saying things with 5-0.

5921
04:14:34,840 --> 04:14:36,140
That's why I was like, oh, maybe...

5922
04:14:36,140 --> 04:14:41,940
What I'm saying is that that game was fundamentally flawed from the beginning, right?

5923
04:14:42,060 --> 04:14:44,660
There was never going to be a good outcome by playing that game.

5924
04:14:44,820 --> 04:14:47,000
And I think that that was realized by most people round one.

5925
04:14:47,120 --> 04:14:48,280
In my VOD, you can go watch my VOD.

5926
04:14:48,360 --> 04:14:50,420
In round one, I said, okay, so you cannot win as a prop.

5927
04:14:50,620 --> 04:14:51,260
I literally said that.

5928
04:14:51,260 --> 04:14:52,400
You cannot win as the prop.

5929
04:14:53,040 --> 04:14:54,300
You're not going to win as the prop.

5930
04:14:54,300 --> 04:14:56,740
I didn't realize how one-sided it was going to be.

5931
04:14:56,740 --> 04:14:57,940
That's actually crazy.

5932
04:14:58,340 --> 04:14:59,460
And that was exactly what I said.

5933
04:15:00,040 --> 04:15:01,660
There's multiple dramas.

5934
04:15:01,960 --> 04:15:02,380
Guys!

5935
04:15:02,680 --> 04:15:03,100
Guys!

5936
04:15:04,180 --> 04:15:06,240
I'm so happy I made it to day three.

5937
04:15:06,860 --> 04:15:07,880
It should not be played.

5938
04:15:08,040 --> 04:15:10,000
It should not be played.

5939
04:15:10,680 --> 04:15:13,260
When there's money on the line or something, you shouldn't do that.

5940
04:15:13,300 --> 04:15:14,520
This is what I saw.

5941
04:15:14,780 --> 04:15:17,420
It should have been stopped round one.

5942
04:15:17,900 --> 04:15:18,320
Exactly.

5943
04:15:18,400 --> 04:15:19,340
That's exactly what I think.

5944
04:15:19,660 --> 04:15:20,340
That's the biggest thing.

5945
04:15:20,340 --> 04:15:21,340
Have a day three surviving.

5946
04:15:22,920 --> 04:15:27,040
You've come to a point, though, where this is very important.

5947
04:15:27,460 --> 04:15:30,420
Where you're saying, you know, the entire event...

5948
04:15:30,420 --> 04:15:30,820
Wait!

5949
04:15:30,820 --> 04:15:31,320
People turning!

5950
04:15:32,180 --> 04:15:32,580
Wait!

5951
04:15:35,380 --> 04:15:36,640
Tomorrow could be even worse.

5952
04:15:36,780 --> 04:15:37,520
Oh my God, that's crazy!

5953
04:15:38,120 --> 04:15:43,680
At this point, putting us all into the doll game tomorrow, 70 people, is like putting us in a blender.

5954
04:15:44,140 --> 04:15:45,420
Oh my God!

5955
04:15:46,140 --> 04:15:46,460
Right.

5956
04:15:48,140 --> 04:15:49,480
I don't think that's fair.

5957
04:15:49,580 --> 04:15:50,900
I don't think that they should do something where...

5958
04:15:50,900 --> 04:15:52,480
10% of the people that survived.

5959
04:15:52,800 --> 04:15:54,600
This time will probably get eliminated.

5960
04:15:54,760 --> 04:15:55,440
And they'll be...

5961
04:15:55,440 --> 04:15:56,420
I'm going to be honest.

5962
04:15:56,540 --> 04:15:57,400
If I get eliminated...

5963
04:15:57,400 --> 04:16:00,220
If they do the doll game tomorrow and I get eliminated because of it, I'll be pissed.

5964
04:16:00,740 --> 04:16:01,140
Right.

5965
04:16:01,280 --> 04:16:01,900
Don't worry.

5966
04:16:02,060 --> 04:16:02,440
I'd be mad.

5967
04:16:03,260 --> 04:16:04,140
Would you not be?

5968
04:16:04,160 --> 04:16:05,420
We can think it's not fair.

5969
04:16:05,520 --> 04:16:09,460
But it's like, it's literally the point of how they designed the event and how they designed the game.

5970
04:16:09,460 --> 04:16:11,520
Bro, people have to turn on one camera to argue!

5971
04:16:12,120 --> 04:16:15,720
I can't let random VTubers have a chance.

5972
04:16:16,800 --> 04:16:21,780
These games have had significantly more randomness than other potential rivals that we've...

5973
04:16:21,780 --> 04:16:23,300
like, that have existed right in the past.

5974
04:16:23,420 --> 04:16:25,840
Like the 2021 Minecraft Rivals.

5975
04:16:26,180 --> 04:16:26,620
Right.

5976
04:16:26,640 --> 04:16:28,760
Rivals is always scuffed in RNG.

5977
04:16:28,860 --> 04:16:29,940
But this...

5978
04:16:29,940 --> 04:16:32,020
The point of this event is...

5979
04:16:32,020 --> 04:16:32,980
I can't believe it.

5980
04:16:33,320 --> 04:16:37,760
I think you guys are getting mixed up with what...

5981
04:16:37,760 --> 04:16:38,340
There's two...

5982
04:16:38,340 --> 04:16:39,740
There's multiple different types of RNG.

5983
04:16:40,320 --> 04:16:44,420
All the other events that we've done so far is a different type of RNG to this.

5984
04:16:44,840 --> 04:16:45,280
Yes.

5985
04:16:45,300 --> 04:16:46,520
I agree 100%.

5986
04:16:47,020 --> 04:16:48,580
It's completely unbalanced RNG.

5987
04:16:48,720 --> 04:16:50,200
It's RNG that everyone is going through.

5988
04:16:50,280 --> 04:16:50,860
But this is not...

5989
04:16:50,860 --> 04:16:51,420
It was still unbalanced.

5990
04:16:51,780 --> 04:16:52,360
It's in the doll game.

5991
04:16:52,420 --> 04:16:54,240
But if you're in the doll game...

5992
04:16:54,240 --> 04:16:56,020
The doll game is a little bit unbalanced as well.

5993
04:16:56,020 --> 04:16:59,480
There's a group of 30 people running into a hallway and then there's a doll in front of it.

5994
04:16:59,580 --> 04:17:00,440
You can still...

5995
04:17:00,440 --> 04:17:01,120
You still...

5996
04:17:01,120 --> 04:17:02,680
How does the AI choose...

5997
04:17:02,680 --> 04:17:05,040
I disagree with that.

5998
04:17:05,040 --> 04:17:07,520
The only part in the doll game that was unfair is the spawn.

5999
04:17:07,660 --> 04:17:09,980
If you are right next to the yellow blonde doll that...

6000
04:17:09,980 --> 04:17:11,880
You're sending me some of the tweets.

6001
04:17:12,140 --> 04:17:12,940
That's the whole thing.

6002
04:17:12,960 --> 04:17:13,760
Everything else was like...

6003
04:17:13,760 --> 04:17:16,680
Now you have decisions on if you want to be in the middle of the group or if you want to be behind.

6004
04:17:16,960 --> 04:17:17,660
How do you react?

6005
04:17:17,760 --> 04:17:21,560
The fact that Sap actually attacked the Latin American...

6006
04:17:21,560 --> 04:17:21,760
But now you've got like...

6007
04:17:21,760 --> 04:17:26,500
The fact that Sap actually antagonized the Spanish speaking streamers?

6008
04:17:26,920 --> 04:17:28,480
That's so crazy.

6009
04:17:29,300 --> 04:17:34,440
Can we revive Red Velvet because he couldn't do anything against that blonde dude?

6010
04:17:34,620 --> 04:17:35,200
Oh my god.

6011
04:17:35,200 --> 04:17:35,440
You know what I mean?

6012
04:17:35,720 --> 04:17:36,480
That's the whole thing.

6013
04:17:36,500 --> 04:17:38,060
We could go back into games and be like...

6014
04:17:38,660 --> 04:17:41,160
Bro, did they not learn what happened in Rust?

6015
04:17:42,900 --> 04:17:44,700
Any game could have had a little problem.

6016
04:17:45,080 --> 04:17:45,740
Like Red.

6017
04:17:45,900 --> 04:17:47,000
I feel bad for Red.

6018
04:17:47,000 --> 04:17:48,220
That was a crazy drama.

6019
04:17:48,740 --> 04:17:50,580
But we're not talking about reviving Red now.

6020
04:17:50,800 --> 04:17:51,680
Oh my god.

6021
04:17:51,760 --> 04:17:54,360
It just gave me like Rust memories.

6022
04:17:54,680 --> 04:17:57,740
Like even with the RNG of today...

6023
04:17:57,740 --> 04:17:59,420
Like I'll be fully honest.

6024
04:17:59,480 --> 04:18:01,980
I got Hunter round one and that obviously gave me a buff.

6025
04:18:02,140 --> 04:18:03,760
But in the three rounds after that...

6026
04:18:03,760 --> 04:18:03,780
What was that?

6027
04:18:03,780 --> 04:18:09,340
So like there was a similar situation and why like Rust is like now divided in between...

6028
04:18:09,340 --> 04:18:10,300
Now like different.

6029
04:18:10,480 --> 04:18:15,140
Because in the past, Rust would invite like separate communities together.

6030
04:18:15,500 --> 04:18:21,500
But it got really bad for one of them to the point where they don't do that anymore.

6031
04:18:21,500 --> 04:18:22,280
For Rust.

6032
04:18:22,740 --> 04:18:25,000
That's why they don't do Rust Twitch Rivals anymore.

6033
04:18:28,100 --> 04:18:33,220
And in those three rounds as a prop, I got instant elims and I got enough kills to just go through just off of that.

6034
04:18:33,460 --> 04:18:34,720
And I think that was awesome.

6035
04:18:34,720 --> 04:18:36,100
Yeah, the Rust Twitch Rivals.

6036
04:18:36,220 --> 04:18:38,780
This is basically like the Rust Twitch Rivals.

6037
04:18:38,820 --> 04:18:39,900
That's just the name of the game.

6038
04:18:39,980 --> 04:18:40,720
Like it was stupid.

6039
04:18:40,900 --> 04:18:41,260
It was like...

6040
04:18:41,260 --> 04:18:42,120
I will agree.

6041
04:18:42,220 --> 04:18:43,620
Like the Hunter thing was just dumb.

6042
04:18:43,700 --> 04:18:44,700
But we all knew it going into it.

6043
04:18:44,700 --> 04:18:45,900
Are we still talking about the Hunter thing?

6044
04:18:45,900 --> 04:18:50,500
Like 90 % of the people here probably had an idea that maybe we should just die right away and just respawn.

6045
04:18:51,680 --> 04:18:56,080
I got 25 of my 30 points from just being...

6046
04:18:56,080 --> 04:18:57,400
I never personally killed myself.

6047
04:18:57,560 --> 04:18:58,580
I never got to be a Hunter.

6048
04:18:58,880 --> 04:18:59,880
And I still survived.

6049
04:19:00,000 --> 04:19:00,900
I only killed one person.

6050
04:19:00,900 --> 04:19:02,480
Yeah, I never intentionally killed myself either.

6051
04:19:02,580 --> 04:19:03,320
And I made it fine.

6052
04:19:03,700 --> 04:19:04,900
I did have one round as Hunter.

6053
04:19:05,040 --> 04:19:05,420
But like...

6054
04:19:05,420 --> 04:19:06,120
It was possible.

6055
04:19:06,120 --> 04:19:07,540
My first round I got almost no points.

6056
04:19:07,640 --> 04:19:08,500
And so it was fine.

6057
04:19:08,500 --> 04:19:08,960
But I didn't...

6058
04:19:08,960 --> 04:19:09,500
Yeah, sure.

6059
04:19:09,560 --> 04:19:10,360
You've got to be a Hunter.

6060
04:19:10,440 --> 04:19:11,740
But like there's people that survive.

6061
04:19:12,140 --> 04:19:18,940
Like again, like would like random VTuber number 13 survive being a Hunter like a Hydra three, four times?

6062
04:19:19,020 --> 04:19:19,280
No.

6063
04:19:19,280 --> 04:19:19,820
No.

6064
04:19:20,920 --> 04:19:21,240
No.

6065
04:19:23,380 --> 04:19:23,700
No.

6066
04:19:24,340 --> 04:19:26,160
Look, look, I'm not like...

6067
04:19:26,660 --> 04:19:29,680
What I'm going to say, I don't want everyone to think that like I'm coke and saying that I need to change it.

6068
04:19:29,760 --> 04:19:31,120
I don't carry the weight.

6069
04:19:31,160 --> 04:19:33,720
Because the thing is, I was propped four times, right?

6070
04:19:33,780 --> 04:19:35,520
It was impossible for me to have ever won the game.

6071
04:19:35,580 --> 04:19:36,660
I literally could never win the game.

6072
04:19:36,780 --> 04:19:39,640
The first two rounds, I could not get any points because I couldn't run around.

6073
04:19:39,760 --> 04:19:40,200
Oh my God.

6074
04:19:40,200 --> 04:19:40,680
How could you?

6075
04:19:40,980 --> 04:19:42,900
I'm not just random VTuber number 13.

6076
04:19:43,680 --> 04:19:45,380
I'm random VTuber number one.

6077
04:19:47,120 --> 04:19:47,800
I'm a pro.

6078
04:19:48,020 --> 04:19:48,160
I'm a pro.

6079
04:19:48,160 --> 04:19:48,460
I'm a pro.

6080
04:19:48,460 --> 04:19:49,160
I'm a pro.

6081
04:19:54,200 --> 04:19:54,680
That's a lot of intense.

6082
04:19:54,680 --> 04:19:54,800
But by way of a heads up.

6083
04:19:54,800 --> 04:20:00,480
I mean, if I would have gotten the失 방 at one point, I never would have been able That is saying, bro, I like was a for the first semicolons of it.

6084
04:20:00,760 --> 04:20:02,220
If I would have done it, I can...

6085
04:20:02,220 --> 04:20:02,680
yeah.

6086
04:20:02,680 --> 04:20:02,720
I can popping food off you.

6087
04:20:02,720 --> 04:20:02,740
Can I walk an extra mile to the top of yours?

6088
04:20:02,760 --> 04:20:02,780
No, no, no, no, no, no.

6089
04:20:03,060 --> 04:20:08,960
You need some whipps to...

6090
04:20:08,960 --> 04:20:09,740
Bye -bye.

6091
04:20:09,740 --> 04:20:13,560
Uh, I have one more thing.

6092
04:20:13,700 --> 04:20:18,120
Uh -huh.

6093
04:20:18,120 --> 04:20:26,140
Then how could you ever say that if somebody said, oh, today's game was complete bull, and they're mad, how could you ever disagree with them?

6094
04:20:26,180 --> 04:20:29,960
You're basically agreeing by saying that you would be mad if you got eliminated tomorrow.

6095
04:20:30,020 --> 04:20:30,360
Right, right, right.

6096
04:20:31,060 --> 04:20:39,740
The counter to that kind of is like I was saying earlier, besides the glitchy things, we all knew that it was dumb.

6097
04:20:39,920 --> 04:20:44,340
We all knew going into the game, the point, how it was going to run, what points we would get where.

6098
04:20:44,340 --> 04:20:52,480
I agree with 5up with the point of that people that didn't get points because of being buggy is fundamentally the problem.

6099
04:20:52,700 --> 04:20:56,580
That's the number one problem in this whole entire thing, and them calling it early.

6100
04:20:57,160 --> 04:21:13,500
The reason that if I was to have lost, and whatever, get a second chance, I'd feel like I was lucky, because I knew going into the game that I had to just rage that I'd get RNG Hunter, and if I didn't, I'd probably get eliminated.

6101
04:21:13,780 --> 04:21:14,300
Yeah.

6102
04:21:14,340 --> 04:21:15,480
Yeah, I mean, that's basically what I'm saying.

6103
04:21:15,560 --> 04:21:16,400
Yeah, it's true.

6104
04:21:17,460 --> 04:21:19,820
We can all agree, Hunter was bullshit.

6105
04:21:20,120 --> 04:21:22,900
Like, why are we still arguing about this?

6106
04:21:23,360 --> 04:21:26,320
Like, why are we still arguing about the Hunter?

6107
04:21:26,320 --> 04:21:28,760
We all know it's bullshit.

6108
04:21:29,320 --> 04:21:33,200
If you did it three times, then you would have been eliminated if it just didn't work for you.

6109
04:21:33,320 --> 04:21:34,200
You would have been at risk.

6110
04:21:35,020 --> 04:21:35,780
That's what I'm saying.

6111
04:21:36,200 --> 04:21:37,560
That's what I'm saying too.

6112
04:21:38,900 --> 04:21:39,560
What's a word?

6113
04:21:39,760 --> 04:21:43,160
If then we were to give people points for that too, right?

6114
04:21:44,080 --> 04:21:51,920
I could literally say the same thing of just being like, oh, I spent 40 seconds doing it, so I could have survived if I had been hiding instead, you know what I mean?

6115
04:21:52,400 --> 04:21:52,520
Yeah.

6116
04:21:53,320 --> 04:21:54,940
What's the guys' consensus right now?

6117
04:21:55,380 --> 04:21:55,780
Nothing.

6118
04:21:56,000 --> 04:21:57,480
Is this something that we're...

6119
04:21:57,480 --> 04:22:00,500
Here's my question.

6120
04:22:00,740 --> 04:22:03,300
Why is it consensus after REA 534?

6121
04:22:03,300 --> 04:22:05,160
Is anything we say having an effect on this or not?

6122
04:22:06,560 --> 04:22:07,280
Probably not.

6123
04:22:07,540 --> 04:22:09,780
Yeah, we're just yelling at each other for no reason.

6124
04:22:10,000 --> 04:22:10,500
Obviously it's not going to happen.

6125
04:22:10,500 --> 04:22:11,880
There's no fruitful end of the conversation.

6126
04:22:12,240 --> 04:22:12,420
Yeah.

6127
04:22:12,420 --> 04:22:12,960
Unless there's an actual end.

6128
04:22:12,960 --> 04:22:15,680
Well, we'll probably look through the Discord chat and see what people think.

6129
04:22:16,720 --> 04:22:17,980
I just want to know...

6130
04:22:17,980 --> 04:22:21,180
I want you guys to answer some questions for me just because I'm curious.

6131
04:22:21,260 --> 04:22:22,920
Not that this would affect literally anything.

6132
04:22:23,240 --> 04:22:23,540
Okay.

6133
04:22:24,540 --> 04:22:26,500
What is the problem with the doll game?

6134
04:22:27,580 --> 04:22:31,420
The problem with the doll game is if you spawn next to the...

6135
04:22:31,420 --> 04:22:34,400
Okay, so there was set spawn points when the doll actually spawns itself.

6136
04:22:34,620 --> 04:22:34,940
All right?

6137
04:22:35,020 --> 04:22:35,100
I know.

6138
04:22:36,080 --> 04:22:45,620
So if you spawned next to that spawn point of specifically the yellow doll or other dolls, it's going to fundamentally seek you and the other people can just run just on spawn points.

6139
04:22:45,980 --> 04:22:46,880
There's nothing you can do.

6140
04:22:47,020 --> 04:22:55,160
And so if you change the spawn points to where that's where you voted and that's where you were going to start instead of your set spawn, that helps a lot.

6141
04:22:55,240 --> 04:22:57,520
The only flaw then becomes the final round.

6142
04:22:57,780 --> 04:23:00,700
Where does the doll spawn when the entire circle is the same color?

6143
04:23:01,160 --> 04:23:01,520
Yep.

6144
04:23:03,120 --> 04:23:04,820
Because then if you are randomly...

6145
04:23:04,820 --> 04:23:11,460
Let's say like the last round is that like blonde doll and it just like you are like happened to be right where it spawns.

6146
04:23:11,460 --> 04:23:14,420
It's just going to immediately speed 20 at you and kill you.

6147
04:23:14,500 --> 04:23:16,240
I think a blonde doll is problematic as how it works.

6148
04:23:16,380 --> 04:23:26,920
But the problem is too if we do the doll game again and we don't have that blonde one, we will be waiting for three hours for everyone to die because it already took long enough with the other ones.

6149
04:23:27,100 --> 04:23:29,100
And we survive sometimes with the other ones.

6150
04:23:29,260 --> 04:23:37,440
Like if we don't like have that random RNG effect to it, skill will come into a factor and we'll all just survive.

6151
04:23:37,920 --> 04:23:39,980
What if they give you longer grace period?

6152
04:23:40,700 --> 04:23:41,680
Bro are we like...

6153
04:23:41,680 --> 04:23:43,120
Are the minecrafters...

6154
04:23:43,120 --> 04:23:46,100
Guys we are getting intel for the next event.

6155
04:23:46,520 --> 04:23:47,020
Yeah that would help.

6156
04:23:47,240 --> 04:23:48,200
As long as they like...

6157
04:23:48,200 --> 04:23:51,740
I mean the problem is it seems like the things don't move.

6158
04:23:52,040 --> 04:23:55,900
Like they move randomly until they get close enough and then they start hunting.

6159
04:23:56,520 --> 04:23:57,740
It's like if we all...

6160
04:23:57,740 --> 04:24:06,600
If they like wait two seconds, we are all going to be like sitting in corners for like a minute waiting for them to randomly like walk into our hallway and then like attack us.

6161
04:24:06,720 --> 04:24:07,040
You know what I mean?

6162
04:24:07,140 --> 04:24:09,700
I mean there were multiple rounds during the doll game.

6163
04:24:09,700 --> 04:24:11,740
That I'm like running at the front of the group.

6164
04:24:11,860 --> 04:24:19,120
I ran into the doll and because of the way the doll AY works like you can just turn around immediately and like pass your hitbox past someone else's and it will never target you.

6165
04:24:19,280 --> 04:24:19,500
Yep.

6166
04:24:19,540 --> 04:24:20,140
If you...

6167
04:24:20,140 --> 04:24:21,240
It was never even hunted.

6168
04:24:21,380 --> 04:24:22,340
It was never even hunted.

6169
04:24:22,360 --> 04:24:24,400
It all takes like five seconds to hit you.

6170
04:24:24,520 --> 04:24:25,200
If you...

6171
04:24:25,200 --> 04:24:25,760
I mean that's just...

6172
04:24:25,760 --> 04:24:29,100
Bro they're so mad that random VTuber number 13 made it here.

6173
04:24:30,160 --> 04:24:33,420
I don't understand why I got brought up like two to three times.

6174
04:24:33,800 --> 04:24:34,240
Like...

6175
04:24:35,420 --> 04:24:35,860
Bro...

6176
04:24:35,860 --> 04:24:38,060
I'm sorry for eliminating...

6177
04:24:38,060 --> 04:24:39,120
I'm sorry for...

6178
04:24:40,520 --> 04:24:40,920
...eliminating...

6179
04:24:40,920 --> 04:24:41,060
...eliminating...

6180
04:24:41,060 --> 04:24:43,140
...your fellow Minecraft players.

6181
04:24:43,540 --> 04:24:43,920
It might be.

6182
04:24:44,100 --> 04:24:44,260
It might be.

6183
04:24:45,660 --> 04:24:50,260
Why not just put people in that like whole potato game and let like...

6184
04:24:50,260 --> 04:24:51,300
Well actually I guess...

6185
04:24:51,300 --> 04:24:52,080
That's actually crazy.

6186
04:24:52,180 --> 04:24:53,680
...I guess if people can't be added to tomorrow...

6187
04:24:53,680 --> 04:24:56,120
Put all 70 of us in Hot Potato and we'll just let it play out.

6188
04:24:57,060 --> 04:24:59,540
I mean that would basically be the same thing as the one game right?

6189
04:25:00,800 --> 04:25:01,600
I mean...

6190
04:25:01,600 --> 04:25:03,640
You guys know there's random VTuber streams on YouTube.

6191
04:25:03,640 --> 04:25:04,940
You can control your fate more with Hot Potato.

6192
04:25:06,200 --> 04:25:06,700
What are the other ones?

6193
04:25:06,940 --> 04:25:08,400
I don't know.

6194
04:25:08,400 --> 04:25:08,620
I don't know.

6195
04:25:08,720 --> 04:25:10,080
What about the...

6196
04:25:10,080 --> 04:25:13,320
At least with Hot Potato I can find Feinberg and try and give him the potato all game.

6197
04:25:13,480 --> 04:25:13,760
I mean...

6198
04:25:13,760 --> 04:25:14,720
Oh my god they're laughing now!

6199
04:25:14,980 --> 04:25:16,380
They're reconnecting!

6200
04:25:17,420 --> 04:25:21,440
The people agree that if they reviewed the VODs and added in the points for...

6201
04:25:22,460 --> 04:25:24,200
We might agree but they might not.

6202
04:25:24,420 --> 04:25:25,840
For survival slash...

6203
04:25:25,840 --> 04:25:26,820
For people who spam...

6204
04:25:26,820 --> 04:25:28,940
Well I mean obviously they're going to do that right?

6205
04:25:29,060 --> 04:25:30,120
Like obviously they're going to do that.

6206
04:25:30,180 --> 04:25:30,920
Like that has to be done.

6207
04:25:31,040 --> 04:25:32,080
Like if there were survival points...

6208
04:25:32,080 --> 04:25:32,440
I don't know.

6209
04:25:32,440 --> 04:25:32,740
I don't know.

6210
04:25:33,140 --> 04:25:34,720
If people tried to do things...

6211
04:25:34,720 --> 04:25:34,860
They won't.

6212
04:25:34,860 --> 04:25:37,560
They won't do anything about this game if they're just gonna have it all survive tomorrow.

6213
04:25:37,600 --> 04:25:37,760
That has to be done.

6214
04:25:37,760 --> 04:25:38,540
Oh no.

6215
04:25:38,700 --> 04:25:40,800
I mean obviously I think we already know that's not happening.

6216
04:25:40,900 --> 04:25:41,760
Like that's not going to occur.

6217
04:25:42,480 --> 04:25:43,260
That's what they said.

6218
04:25:43,360 --> 04:25:43,860
I don't expect...

6219
04:25:43,860 --> 04:25:44,660
That's what they said right now.

6220
04:25:44,700 --> 04:25:46,480
Right now that's what I'm planning for.

6221
04:25:46,560 --> 04:25:47,960
That we're playing that game tomorrow.

6222
04:25:48,260 --> 04:25:48,880
That's what I'm planning for.

6223
04:25:48,880 --> 04:25:52,880
And obviously like I think the best thing is like if that happens we all just like accept it.

6224
04:25:52,940 --> 04:25:53,360
Go GG.

6225
04:25:53,420 --> 04:25:54,200
Like GG go next.

6226
04:25:54,480 --> 04:25:54,640
And...

6227
04:25:54,640 --> 04:25:56,140
Oh my god they're finally accepting it.

6228
04:25:56,220 --> 04:25:56,280
I don't know.

6229
04:25:56,280 --> 04:25:58,000
Like not have a rift be between us as players.

6230
04:25:58,700 --> 04:26:01,120
That was literally what I said at the end of my stream.

6231
04:26:01,180 --> 04:26:02,560
I was like at the end of the day like it's a game.

6232
04:26:02,660 --> 04:26:03,440
We were playing a game.

6233
04:26:03,480 --> 04:26:03,680
Yeah.

6234
04:26:03,680 --> 04:26:05,000
Like nobody should be mad at anybody.

6235
04:26:05,000 --> 04:26:07,480
Nobody should be like hating on other people.

6236
04:26:07,560 --> 04:26:08,320
Like it's a game.

6237
04:26:08,400 --> 04:26:09,180
Like we're playing a game.

6238
04:26:09,300 --> 04:26:12,460
Yes it was definitely dumb but I mean it's just a game.

6239
04:26:12,840 --> 04:26:12,900
Like...

6240
04:26:12,900 --> 04:26:13,980
Oh my god the recuts.

6241
04:26:14,080 --> 04:26:15,300
Oh my god guys.

6242
04:26:15,800 --> 04:26:16,160
Yeah.

6243
04:26:16,160 --> 04:26:16,520
Right.

6244
04:26:16,720 --> 04:26:16,940
Exactly.

6245
04:26:17,380 --> 04:26:17,740
Right.

6246
04:26:17,820 --> 04:26:20,640
It changes the dynamic when there's 70k on the line or whatever.

6247
04:26:20,900 --> 04:26:21,040
Friendship wins.

6248
04:26:21,060 --> 04:26:22,780
And then the game is super RNG or whatever.

6249
04:26:22,880 --> 04:26:25,860
It's like definitely changes the vibe and is very tilting.

6250
04:26:25,960 --> 04:26:27,660
Like when you feel like you can't do anything.

6251
04:26:27,660 --> 04:26:29,020
They're finally agreeing that it's RNG.

6252
04:26:29,180 --> 04:26:29,520
I don't know.

6253
04:26:29,520 --> 04:26:30,840
What I was trying to say earlier Sam.

6254
04:26:30,920 --> 04:26:34,760
Even though like you said you don't care and I'm not saying this now to like say that you do care or anything like that.

6255
04:26:35,000 --> 04:26:35,240
Yeah.

6256
04:26:35,240 --> 04:26:39,040
It's like the people that do care that will be eliminated today will be mad.

6257
04:26:39,360 --> 04:26:42,840
And if we switch it the people that did survive are gonna be mad.

6258
04:26:42,980 --> 04:26:44,080
Not at specific people.

6259
04:26:44,240 --> 04:26:45,200
Like I'm not mad at anyone here.

6260
04:26:45,560 --> 04:26:48,820
But like someone is gonna be mad no matter what happens now.

6261
04:26:48,820 --> 04:26:50,300
Guys we went through a character arc guys.

6262
04:26:50,720 --> 04:26:51,720
No matter what they choose.

6263
04:26:51,720 --> 04:26:52,820
It's like watching a movie.

6264
04:26:53,320 --> 04:26:56,700
We're just gonna have to deal with it and if you're pissy just don't play another Rivals I guess.

6265
04:26:56,800 --> 04:26:57,100
I don't know.

6266
04:26:58,500 --> 04:26:59,160
Yeah I mean.

6267
04:26:59,260 --> 04:27:03,260
30 people gone to dull RNG or 30 people gone to that game though.

6268
04:27:03,420 --> 04:27:04,220
Right exactly.

6269
04:27:05,000 --> 04:27:05,360
That's the question right.

6270
04:27:05,480 --> 04:27:13,000
That's what it comes down to is are we are we killing 30 people to a game that was the hunter game or just to dull game right because they have to kill 30 people.

6271
04:27:13,340 --> 04:27:14,200
Right I agree.

6272
04:27:14,320 --> 04:27:16,360
I think the dull game was completely unbalanced the whole time.

6273
04:27:16,460 --> 04:27:17,220
I had a goaded spawn.

6274
04:27:17,380 --> 04:27:22,120
I spawned in green and like the dolls are spawning on the opposite half the entire game so I just got to run away at the beginning for free.

6275
04:27:22,260 --> 04:27:22,400
I mean.

6276
04:27:22,480 --> 04:27:22,800
Oh yeah.

6277
04:27:22,860 --> 04:27:24,400
I mean there but there's strategy to that.

6278
04:27:24,520 --> 04:27:27,800
Like um if I will agree that I I just like.

6279
04:27:27,900 --> 04:27:28,840
I can't believe it.

6280
04:27:28,980 --> 04:27:33,620
I was like Sapnap just yelled everyone to go on the other side so they listen to him.

6281
04:27:33,620 --> 04:27:44,160
And they the the doll always just spawned on the other side because Sapnap would just scream and then like that skill to where like that's why like me and Feinberg didn't have to worry about anything.

6282
04:27:44,280 --> 04:27:45,120
The power of friendship.

6283
04:27:45,160 --> 04:27:45,980
The good ending.

6284
04:27:46,180 --> 04:27:46,820
The only problem.

6285
04:27:46,940 --> 04:27:47,320
What a twist.

6286
04:27:47,460 --> 04:27:51,760
We're talking about like unfairness in any game and every single thing whatever blah blah blah blah blah.

6287
04:27:51,880 --> 04:27:57,120
Someone like Red would have been unfairly killed because there was just physically nothing they could have done.

6288
04:27:57,140 --> 04:27:58,360
I watched Red's POV.

6289
04:27:58,460 --> 04:28:02,140
He could have gone on the other door because he ran for a riskier door.

6290
04:28:02,400 --> 04:28:02,780
Um.

6291
04:28:03,620 --> 04:28:04,240
That's the only argument I have.

6292
04:28:04,500 --> 04:28:04,720
Sure.

6293
04:28:04,840 --> 04:28:04,920
For that.

6294
04:28:05,200 --> 04:28:06,880
There is a thing he could have done.

6295
04:28:06,920 --> 04:28:07,200
He watched other people's POV.

6296
04:28:07,200 --> 04:28:07,560
Is it the best?

6297
04:28:07,560 --> 04:28:07,760
No.

6298
04:28:07,900 --> 04:28:11,440
He also didn't find any safe zone just in the area he's running.

6299
04:28:11,760 --> 04:28:14,260
That's the only argument but there was something he could have done technically.

6300
04:28:15,100 --> 04:28:18,120
And that same thought process is that there could have been other things.

6301
04:28:18,120 --> 04:28:21,780
There was not anything people could have done technically for a chest not working.

6302
04:28:22,280 --> 04:28:23,160
Just not doing it.

6303
04:28:23,240 --> 04:28:23,260
Yeah.

6304
04:28:23,260 --> 04:28:25,540
They're gonna have gold mole points from the rest of the game.

6305
04:28:25,640 --> 04:28:26,760
I mean what they could have done is.

6306
04:28:26,780 --> 04:28:27,620
I guess if you were arguing that.

6307
04:28:27,620 --> 04:28:29,000
Probably bot reviewing guys.

6308
04:28:29,080 --> 04:28:30,740
I told you Minecraft streamers.

6309
04:28:30,800 --> 04:28:31,580
You're a whole nother level.

6310
04:28:32,340 --> 04:28:33,060
Especially speedrunners.

6311
04:28:33,060 --> 04:28:33,460
Especially speedrunners.

6312
04:28:34,320 --> 04:28:36,160
Every round it got like a million points.

6313
04:28:36,220 --> 04:28:37,020
Here's the thing though.

6314
04:28:37,060 --> 04:28:37,680
Is that.

6315
04:28:39,180 --> 04:28:40,440
Yeah they're bot reviewing.

6316
04:28:40,780 --> 04:28:42,320
How do they have time to bot review?

6317
04:28:42,580 --> 04:28:43,160
It's actually not ideal though.

6318
04:28:43,200 --> 04:28:44,560
This guy literally bot reviewed in the middle of between games.

6319
04:28:44,560 --> 04:28:49,260
Round 1 and round 2 you're actually giving whoever spawned as hunter way more points by like intentionally dying to them.

6320
04:28:49,480 --> 04:28:50,820
The hunter 1 round.

6321
04:28:50,920 --> 04:28:56,780
They just probably got like a billion points because the spawn time was like one and a Yeah the spawn time should have been consistent.

6322
04:28:56,920 --> 04:28:58,560
The only way to fix the game is this.

6323
04:28:58,680 --> 04:29:00,280
Everyone should have got a turn to be the hunter.

6324
04:29:00,460 --> 04:29:02,780
And everyone should have had turns that they were not the hunter.

6325
04:29:02,780 --> 04:29:04,180
Everyone should have got one turn to be the hunter.

6326
04:29:04,300 --> 04:29:05,940
That way everybody gets a chance to be hunter.

6327
04:29:06,260 --> 04:29:09,880
And also whenever you're not hunter and whenever you die or whatever.

6328
04:29:10,960 --> 04:29:14,080
You should just have the same respawn timer across all four rounds.

6329
04:29:14,100 --> 04:29:16,220
For those who are FPS streamers this is a whole new level for us.

6330
04:29:17,080 --> 04:29:18,780
This is how arguments should be.

6331
04:29:18,920 --> 04:29:20,240
Like hunter the next round.

6332
04:29:20,460 --> 04:29:23,220
Let alone the people who are the props.

6333
04:29:24,660 --> 04:29:25,960
You have a way big advantage.

6334
04:29:26,020 --> 04:29:27,440
I've never experienced this before.

6335
04:29:27,760 --> 04:29:28,880
Just because you were hunter at the beginning and there's a cooldown timer.

6336
04:29:29,100 --> 04:29:31,820
And that's all because there's a cooldown on like killing.

6337
04:29:31,820 --> 04:29:32,040
Right?

6338
04:29:32,780 --> 04:29:33,280
There's a cooldown on killing.

6339
04:29:33,280 --> 04:29:35,820
Which means that there being a cooldown for respawning.

6340
04:29:35,960 --> 04:29:43,780
When you spam cooldowns like this into a game then it like leads to situations where like inherently just terrible gameplay emerges.

6341
04:29:44,500 --> 04:29:44,820
It's so civil.

6342
04:29:44,820 --> 04:29:47,820
The thing is it's civil but like nothing is being agreed upon.

6343
04:29:47,980 --> 04:29:48,720
I agree.

6344
04:29:48,780 --> 04:29:50,320
They probably should have told us about.

6345
04:29:50,600 --> 04:29:55,560
Cause like somebody or one of the organizers came in and was like so what did you guys agree on?

6346
04:29:55,600 --> 04:29:56,300
Now I know what happened.

6347
04:29:56,360 --> 04:29:59,780
The person hunting me that was standing on top of me was on kill cooldown.

6348
04:29:59,940 --> 04:30:01,220
But I didn't know.

6349
04:30:01,240 --> 04:30:02,380
He was on kill cooldown.

6350
04:30:02,840 --> 04:30:03,980
I'm like trying to hide.

6351
04:30:04,200 --> 04:30:04,420
Right?

6352
04:30:04,520 --> 04:30:06,960
And like so I have no idea that bro can't kill me right now.

6353
04:30:07,040 --> 04:30:07,960
What I should do is run away.

6354
04:30:08,520 --> 04:30:09,620
I have no idea of that.

6355
04:30:09,660 --> 04:30:09,960
But again.

6356
04:30:10,220 --> 04:30:10,780
Again though.

6357
04:30:10,860 --> 04:30:11,700
That's part of the game.

6358
04:30:11,820 --> 04:30:11,980
Right?

6359
04:30:12,080 --> 04:30:13,600
Like that's part of the game is you don't know everything.

6360
04:30:13,800 --> 04:30:15,120
Some people turned their webcams on.

6361
04:30:15,240 --> 04:30:15,760
That was crazy.

6362
04:30:15,780 --> 04:30:16,620
It's very disambiguous I guess.

6363
04:30:16,740 --> 04:30:17,820
I like said that as a joke.

6364
04:30:18,240 --> 04:30:19,780
About how like turn the webcam on.

6365
04:30:19,860 --> 04:30:20,740
Look into his eye.

6366
04:30:20,740 --> 04:30:21,200
To debate.

6367
04:30:21,580 --> 04:30:23,300
And some people actually did that.

6368
04:30:23,400 --> 04:30:24,380
I was like oh my god.

6369
04:30:25,100 --> 04:30:26,000
This is serious.

6370
04:30:26,320 --> 04:30:26,660
We knew the spawn time when we started the game.

6371
04:30:26,720 --> 04:30:28,440
Cause people were saying like oh it's one minute and a half.

6372
04:30:28,620 --> 04:30:29,980
Like we knew that stuff sucked.

6373
04:30:29,980 --> 04:30:32,420
And it was like the kill codon stuff was stupid.

6374
04:30:32,600 --> 04:30:33,340
We should have known that.

6375
04:30:34,000 --> 04:30:34,540
But um.

6376
04:30:34,900 --> 04:30:37,800
Like everything that was like knowledge that we knew.

6377
04:30:38,120 --> 04:30:39,540
Like once you like played around.

6378
04:30:39,800 --> 04:30:42,580
Like if you figured out all the stuff were in the same spots every single time.

6379
04:30:42,880 --> 04:30:44,240
That's just like that is just knowledge.

6380
04:30:44,500 --> 04:30:49,340
The biggest problem with that game is that people weren't getting points because the thing was buggy.

6381
04:30:49,680 --> 04:30:51,600
That's inherently the only problem.

6382
04:30:51,760 --> 04:30:52,880
If you didn't get hunter.

6383
04:30:53,020 --> 04:30:54,280
That just kind of RNG starts to beat you.

6384
04:30:54,280 --> 04:30:55,140
Yeah this feels like a court trial.

6385
04:30:55,320 --> 04:30:57,360
You can still survive if you like did this or that.

6386
04:30:57,360 --> 04:30:57,920
Or this or that.

6387
04:30:57,920 --> 04:31:00,920
But inherently if you didn't get hunter.

6388
04:31:01,140 --> 04:31:03,520
It is LU at that point.

6389
04:31:03,620 --> 04:31:11,240
Like every game in this whole entire event and continue to be will probably have some type of dumb RNG that like if you don't like.

6390
04:31:11,380 --> 04:31:11,860
Call me out.

6391
04:31:11,940 --> 04:31:12,820
Call me out right now.

6392
04:31:12,980 --> 04:31:14,860
Your head is going to explode.

6393
04:31:15,120 --> 04:31:15,760
I don't know.

6394
04:31:15,960 --> 04:31:16,740
Call me out.

6395
04:31:17,020 --> 04:31:18,480
Call out the random beat you're wearing.

6396
04:31:18,500 --> 04:31:18,520
Like who even knows.

6397
04:31:18,540 --> 04:31:24,380
Like the last game to decide who wins this event could be like oh does your name start with the letter F?

6398
04:31:24,520 --> 04:31:25,580
Oh congratulations you win.

6399
04:31:26,200 --> 04:31:27,480
For $70,000.

6400
04:31:28,320 --> 04:31:30,340
This guy coded it from above you hear that?

6401
04:31:31,180 --> 04:31:32,460
This guy is cheating.

6402
04:31:33,620 --> 04:31:38,040
Like inherently like the games coming up too could be problematic too.

6403
04:31:38,160 --> 04:31:39,860
And then what are we going to do for every single game?

6404
04:31:40,060 --> 04:31:40,520
Like oh.

6405
04:31:40,740 --> 04:31:50,260
I think the only thing I the only reason that I feel like they need to do something about this game was because everyone knew during round one that like the game was just scuffed.

6406
04:31:50,380 --> 04:31:51,620
Like it was just a scuffed game.

6407
04:31:51,920 --> 04:31:52,440
Like even.

6408
04:31:53,540 --> 04:31:53,980
Right.

6409
04:31:54,120 --> 04:31:54,920
That's what I'm saying.

6410
04:31:54,940 --> 04:31:55,920
That's what should have happened.

6411
04:31:55,980 --> 04:31:56,700
Is the rivals.

6412
04:31:56,700 --> 04:31:57,660
People should have said wait a minute.

6413
04:31:57,760 --> 04:31:58,820
This doesn't make any sense.

6414
04:31:58,820 --> 04:31:59,400
You know what's messed up.

6415
04:31:59,480 --> 04:32:02,860
Like look at the disparity and like the points already after a singular round.

6416
04:32:02,860 --> 04:32:03,160
The organizer has been listening to this.

6417
04:32:03,160 --> 04:32:03,860
We know that like.

6418
04:32:04,480 --> 04:32:06,780
One of the organizers has been listening to this and they.

6419
04:32:06,780 --> 04:32:07,100
One of the organizers has been listening to this and they.

6420
04:32:07,200 --> 04:32:07,720
One round two automatic.

6421
04:32:08,760 --> 04:32:11,480
Having these people call her events scuffed.

6422
04:32:11,720 --> 04:32:13,080
I feel so bad.

6423
04:32:13,460 --> 04:32:14,360
She has been.

6424
04:32:14,580 --> 04:32:17,120
She has been listening to this.

6425
04:32:17,140 --> 04:32:18,840
We're playing in a lot of events that cost a lot of money.

6426
04:32:18,840 --> 04:32:19,640
They were in the call.

6427
04:32:19,960 --> 04:32:21,120
They were in the call.

6428
04:32:21,280 --> 04:32:21,760
The thing that people failed to do.

6429
04:32:21,760 --> 04:32:22,460
He dipped down.

6430
04:32:22,620 --> 04:32:23,020
They did.

6431
04:32:23,500 --> 04:32:25,500
They never test the game in a computer.

6432
04:32:25,500 --> 04:32:25,760
True.

6433
04:32:26,220 --> 04:32:26,620
Yeah.

6434
04:32:26,620 --> 04:32:26,680
Yeah.

6435
04:32:26,680 --> 04:32:26,780
Yeah.

6436
04:32:26,780 --> 04:32:27,880
With competitive players.

6437
04:32:28,140 --> 04:32:28,260
Yeah.

6438
04:32:28,380 --> 04:32:29,360
With competitive players.

6439
04:32:29,380 --> 04:32:31,260
The game is never tested in a way where like.

6440
04:32:31,320 --> 04:32:32,820
We got 70k on the line.

6441
04:32:32,900 --> 04:32:33,000
Yeah.

6442
04:32:33,080 --> 04:32:34,640
You just take a hundred people out of fucking.

6443
04:32:34,640 --> 04:32:35,580
I agree with that.

6444
04:32:35,680 --> 04:32:37,780
The fact that there's 70k on the line.

6445
04:32:38,160 --> 04:32:38,560
Yeah.

6446
04:32:38,560 --> 04:32:41,440
And the games weren't as well tested as it was.

6447
04:32:41,720 --> 04:32:42,400
They figure out everything.

6448
04:32:42,740 --> 04:32:43,380
Because like.

6449
04:32:43,540 --> 04:32:45,280
I've had to test games out before.

6450
04:32:45,580 --> 04:32:46,240
One time.

6451
04:32:46,300 --> 04:32:47,120
The fact that like.

6452
04:32:47,120 --> 04:32:48,020
They didn't test the game.

6453
04:32:48,020 --> 04:32:49,460
They didn't test the games enough.

6454
04:32:49,680 --> 04:32:50,080
If.

6455
04:32:50,240 --> 04:32:51,460
With the quantity of people.

6456
04:32:51,540 --> 04:32:52,380
Hear me out Twitch Rivals.

6457
04:32:52,460 --> 04:32:53,040
If you're hearing this.

6458
04:32:53,120 --> 04:32:53,960
If Twitch Rivals.

6459
04:32:54,160 --> 04:32:54,820
Offered me.

6460
04:32:55,200 --> 04:32:55,600
Like.

6461
04:32:56,680 --> 04:32:57,120
To like.

6462
04:32:57,240 --> 04:32:58,760
Make sure their events weren't dumb.

6463
04:32:58,940 --> 04:32:59,640
I would do that.

6464
04:32:59,640 --> 04:33:00,260
Than playing this.

6465
04:33:00,480 --> 04:33:00,860
You know what I mean?

6466
04:33:01,280 --> 04:33:01,640
Like.

6467
04:33:01,740 --> 04:33:02,000
Yeah.

6468
04:33:02,000 --> 04:33:02,880
But would you do it for free?

6469
04:33:02,960 --> 04:33:03,380
They just need to like.

6470
04:33:03,400 --> 04:33:04,080
Make sure.

6471
04:33:04,240 --> 04:33:04,660
That like.

6472
04:33:04,680 --> 04:33:05,380
Their things are fair.

6473
04:33:05,560 --> 04:33:06,560
And do something like that.

6474
04:33:06,640 --> 04:33:07,740
Offer people 10 bucks.

6475
04:33:07,860 --> 04:33:09,240
To just play their game for an hour.

6476
04:33:09,380 --> 04:33:10,320
And then give feedback.

6477
04:33:10,580 --> 04:33:10,780
Yeah.

6478
04:33:10,860 --> 04:33:11,840
That's just something I've learned.

6479
04:33:11,840 --> 04:33:12,480
By playing like.

6480
04:33:12,500 --> 04:33:13,160
All of Carlin.

6481
04:33:13,220 --> 04:33:13,580
Oh.

6482
04:33:13,640 --> 04:33:13,860
Yeah.

6483
04:33:13,940 --> 04:33:14,360
A hundred percent.

6484
04:33:15,560 --> 04:33:15,920
Um.

6485
04:33:16,040 --> 04:33:16,440
At least.

6486
04:33:16,760 --> 04:33:17,500
Twitch Rivals.

6487
04:33:17,500 --> 04:33:18,120
Do you hear that?

6488
04:33:18,300 --> 04:33:20,300
If they weren't going to do the doll game thing.

6489
04:33:21,460 --> 04:33:21,900
Well then.

6490
04:33:21,900 --> 04:33:22,320
At that point.

6491
04:33:22,420 --> 04:33:23,180
How did more people join back?

6492
04:33:23,180 --> 04:33:23,940
They didn't do the doll thing.

6493
04:33:24,060 --> 04:33:24,880
That's how people left.

6494
04:33:25,060 --> 04:33:25,280
Yeah.

6495
04:33:25,280 --> 04:33:26,460
If they didn't do the doll game.

6496
04:33:26,620 --> 04:33:27,560
They'd have to give.

6497
04:33:27,560 --> 04:33:29,060
The survival points to people.

6498
04:33:29,540 --> 04:33:30,140
And then.

6499
04:33:30,160 --> 04:33:31,100
Give back the points.

6500
04:33:31,160 --> 04:33:31,960
That people randomly.

6501
04:33:32,420 --> 04:33:32,820
Killed.

6502
04:33:32,860 --> 04:33:33,160
Like.

6503
04:33:33,180 --> 04:33:33,760
Killed like.

6504
04:33:33,800 --> 04:33:34,120
Their points.

6505
04:33:34,200 --> 04:33:35,460
By punching random things.

6506
04:33:35,840 --> 04:33:36,440
And then.

6507
04:33:36,460 --> 04:33:37,020
Does everyone agree.

6508
04:33:37,160 --> 04:33:38,020
That that's better than.

6509
04:33:38,320 --> 04:33:39,100
The doll game?

6510
04:33:39,220 --> 04:33:39,560
Yeah.

6511
04:33:39,820 --> 04:33:40,920
A million percent.

6512
04:33:40,920 --> 04:33:41,220
I'm pretty sure.

6513
04:33:41,280 --> 04:33:42,680
Every single person would agree.

6514
04:33:42,880 --> 04:33:42,980
Yeah.

6515
04:33:43,020 --> 04:33:43,120
Well.

6516
04:33:43,200 --> 04:33:43,340
I mean.

6517
04:33:43,360 --> 04:33:43,680
Obviously.

6518
04:33:43,680 --> 04:33:45,000
That game's dumber than the doll game.

6519
04:33:45,440 --> 04:33:45,840
Obviously.

6520
04:33:52,100 --> 04:33:52,460
But.

6521
04:33:52,460 --> 04:33:52,560
It's a good idea.

6522
04:33:52,580 --> 04:33:54,020
Have people open a ticket.

6523
04:33:54,160 --> 04:33:54,500
If they.

6524
04:33:54,800 --> 04:33:56,020
Genuinely experienced a bug.

6525
04:33:56,220 --> 04:33:56,960
Or trolled.

6526
04:33:56,960 --> 04:33:57,960
At the end of the last round.

6527
04:33:58,000 --> 04:33:58,920
After they said it was cancelled.

6528
04:33:59,440 --> 04:34:00,320
That's what I think too.

6529
04:34:00,420 --> 04:34:00,440
Reach out.

6530
04:34:00,460 --> 04:34:00,860
With the points.

6531
04:34:00,960 --> 04:34:01,420
And go from there.

6532
04:34:01,460 --> 04:34:01,820
That's.

6533
04:34:01,820 --> 04:34:02,240
I feel like.

6534
04:34:02,360 --> 04:34:02,780
That's like.

6535
04:34:02,780 --> 04:34:03,280
The only way.

6536
04:34:03,280 --> 04:34:03,960
The only way.

6537
04:34:03,960 --> 04:34:04,800
To do anything about it.

6538
04:34:04,800 --> 04:34:05,060
Right?

6539
04:34:05,360 --> 04:34:06,060
I think if.

6540
04:34:06,080 --> 04:34:06,980
The staff knew.

6541
04:34:07,060 --> 04:34:07,520
That like.

6542
04:34:07,780 --> 04:34:08,880
Most people agree.

6543
04:34:09,020 --> 04:34:09,580
On something.

6544
04:34:10,240 --> 04:34:10,600
They.

6545
04:34:10,840 --> 04:34:11,700
Can make a better.

6546
04:34:11,860 --> 04:34:12,460
Like decision.

6547
04:34:12,460 --> 04:34:12,940
Obviously.

6548
04:34:13,000 --> 04:34:13,780
Not to like.

6549
04:34:14,340 --> 04:34:15,380
Tell them what to do.

6550
04:34:15,420 --> 04:34:15,580
But.

6551
04:34:16,160 --> 04:34:16,520
Sure.

6552
04:34:17,320 --> 04:34:18,100
I feel like.

6553
04:34:18,340 --> 04:34:18,700
Everybody.

6554
04:34:19,180 --> 04:34:20,220
Everybody prefers that.

6555
04:34:20,300 --> 04:34:20,960
Over the doll game.

6556
04:34:21,080 --> 04:34:21,380
And probably.

6557
04:34:21,460 --> 04:34:22,120
Even some people.

6558
04:34:22,160 --> 04:34:22,700
Who got eliminated.

6559
04:34:22,780 --> 04:34:23,680
Would agree that like.

6560
04:34:23,680 --> 04:34:24,620
Just give us $500.

6561
04:34:25,080 --> 04:34:26,180
I don't care anymore.

6562
04:34:26,740 --> 04:34:27,600
In order to like.

6563
04:34:27,860 --> 04:34:28,420
Calculate those.

6564
04:34:28,880 --> 04:34:29,800
Completely bugged points.

6565
04:34:30,340 --> 04:34:30,700
Yeah.

6566
04:34:30,720 --> 04:34:30,920
Like.

6567
04:34:30,920 --> 04:34:31,340
To be clear.

6568
04:34:31,400 --> 04:34:31,540
Like.

6569
04:34:31,580 --> 04:34:32,560
I don't want to come back tomorrow.

6570
04:34:32,880 --> 04:34:33,220
From.

6571
04:34:33,680 --> 04:34:34,040
Like.

6572
04:34:34,080 --> 04:34:34,420
Whatever.

6573
04:34:34,580 --> 04:34:35,140
And then.

6574
04:34:35,200 --> 04:34:35,400
Like.

6575
04:34:35,400 --> 04:34:35,820
I'm one of the people.

6576
04:34:35,840 --> 04:34:36,120
That got eliminated.

6577
04:34:36,240 --> 04:34:36,320
Right.

6578
04:34:36,360 --> 04:34:36,440
Like.

6579
04:34:36,480 --> 04:34:36,860
I don't want to come.

6580
04:34:36,880 --> 04:34:37,560
Start streaming tomorrow.

6581
04:34:37,740 --> 04:34:38,220
And start playing.

6582
04:34:38,300 --> 04:34:38,540
Rivals.

6583
04:34:39,760 --> 04:34:40,000
Like.

6584
04:34:42,260 --> 04:34:42,920
I don't understand.

6585
04:34:43,340 --> 04:34:43,580
Because.

6586
04:34:43,660 --> 04:34:44,320
The way they word it.

6587
04:34:44,360 --> 04:34:44,700
Is like.

6588
04:34:44,780 --> 04:34:44,900
Kind of.

6589
04:34:45,060 --> 04:34:45,300
Disambiguous.

6590
04:34:45,400 --> 04:34:45,680
As well.

6591
04:34:45,760 --> 04:34:46,160
In the discord.

6592
04:34:46,300 --> 04:34:46,760
About that.

6593
04:34:46,840 --> 04:34:47,080
So.

6594
04:34:47,540 --> 04:34:47,780
Like.

6595
04:34:47,800 --> 04:34:48,060
I don't know.

6596
04:34:48,100 --> 04:34:48,580
I agree.

6597
04:34:48,720 --> 04:34:49,040
I think.

6598
04:34:49,040 --> 04:34:49,560
That the only way.

6599
04:34:49,640 --> 04:34:50,020
They can do.

6600
04:34:50,080 --> 04:34:50,260
Anything.

6601
04:34:50,320 --> 04:34:51,120
That's remotely fair.

6602
04:34:51,260 --> 04:34:51,580
Is to.

6603
04:34:51,860 --> 04:34:52,100
Take.

6604
04:34:52,100 --> 04:34:53,220
All of the streams.

6605
04:34:53,460 --> 04:34:54,280
And everyone who says.

6606
04:34:54,380 --> 04:34:55,120
That they didn't get points.

6607
04:34:55,160 --> 04:34:55,620
They should have got.

6608
04:34:55,740 --> 04:34:56,500
And to fix their points.

6609
04:34:56,660 --> 04:34:57,140
And then see.

6610
04:34:57,320 --> 04:34:58,080
Who the 30 were.

6611
04:34:58,180 --> 04:34:58,360
Or whatever.

6612
04:34:58,480 --> 04:34:59,020
People can lie.

6613
04:34:59,240 --> 04:35:00,000
Regardless of how that.

6614
04:35:00,000 --> 04:35:00,240
Oh wait.

6615
04:35:00,280 --> 04:35:00,420
No.

6616
04:35:00,420 --> 04:35:00,500
There's clips.

6617
04:35:00,800 --> 04:35:01,800
Whoever gets eliminated from that.

6618
04:35:01,820 --> 04:35:02,780
Then that was how the game.

6619
04:35:02,820 --> 04:35:03,640
Should have eliminated you.

6620
04:35:03,680 --> 04:35:03,860
Right.

6621
04:35:03,920 --> 04:35:05,120
So that's just the only fair way.

6622
04:35:05,720 --> 04:35:06,260
It's not fair.

6623
04:35:06,480 --> 04:35:06,840
Because like.

6624
04:35:06,900 --> 04:35:07,720
People can like.

6625
04:35:07,960 --> 04:35:08,480
Just say.

6626
04:35:08,640 --> 04:35:11,380
And the points that people like.

6627
04:35:11,500 --> 04:35:12,060
Once they said.

6628
04:35:12,140 --> 04:35:12,700
That they were throwing.

6629
04:35:12,980 --> 04:35:13,300
Like.

6630
04:35:13,920 --> 04:35:14,240
Sure.

6631
04:35:14,340 --> 04:35:14,660
Yeah.

6632
04:35:14,820 --> 04:35:15,140
Like.

6633
04:35:15,140 --> 04:35:16,020
Give back the points.

6634
04:35:16,040 --> 04:35:16,060
Yeah.

6635
04:35:16,060 --> 04:35:16,540
You should get those back.

6636
04:35:16,540 --> 04:35:17,320
Well that's like.

6637
04:35:17,340 --> 04:35:17,760
I was throwing the last game.

6638
04:35:17,760 --> 04:35:19,120
The only reason they should get those points back.

6639
04:35:19,120 --> 04:35:20,080
Is because they said.

6640
04:35:20,080 --> 04:35:21,040
They were rewriting the game.

6641
04:35:21,300 --> 04:35:21,540
Yeah.

6642
04:35:21,660 --> 04:35:21,940
Exactly.

6643
04:35:22,040 --> 04:35:22,340
Yeah.

6644
04:35:22,440 --> 04:35:22,940
If they say.

6645
04:35:22,940 --> 04:35:23,580
They're rewriting the game.

6646
04:35:23,660 --> 04:35:24,660
Then everything is like.

6647
04:35:24,680 --> 04:35:25,500
Up in the air.

6648
04:35:25,520 --> 04:35:25,940
At that point.

6649
04:35:26,000 --> 04:35:26,320
Basically.

6650
04:35:26,420 --> 04:35:27,040
I stopped.

6651
04:35:27,040 --> 04:35:27,440
Nomming.

6652
04:35:27,640 --> 04:35:28,780
As a hunter.

6653
04:35:29,160 --> 04:35:30,740
Because I thought it was over.

6654
04:35:30,940 --> 04:35:31,460
And I killed them.

6655
04:35:31,460 --> 04:35:32,200
So that should be.

6656
04:35:32,240 --> 04:35:32,760
5 points.

6657
04:35:32,940 --> 04:35:33,860
My chest.

6658
04:35:33,880 --> 04:35:34,620
Was broken.

6659
04:35:35,100 --> 04:35:36,280
That's another 5 points.

6660
04:35:36,320 --> 04:35:37,480
That like random person.

6661
04:35:37,600 --> 04:35:38,240
That's 10 points.

6662
04:35:38,300 --> 04:35:38,760
Right there.

6663
04:35:45,140 --> 04:35:45,400
10 points.

6664
04:35:45,460 --> 04:35:46,180
I stopped.

6665
04:35:46,440 --> 04:35:46,800
Nomming.

6666
04:35:46,820 --> 04:35:47,400
I stopped.

6667
04:35:47,660 --> 04:35:48,020
Nomming.

6668
04:35:48,140 --> 04:35:48,500
Guys.

6669
04:35:48,660 --> 04:35:49,480
You were all there.

6670
04:35:49,880 --> 04:35:50,040
Like.

6671
04:35:50,040 --> 04:35:50,440
I will.

6672
04:35:50,560 --> 04:35:50,700
I will.

6673
04:35:52,120 --> 04:35:52,480
No.

6674
04:35:52,540 --> 04:35:52,720
Sorry.

6675
04:35:52,840 --> 04:35:53,180
No.

6676
04:35:53,180 --> 04:35:53,560
You go.

6677
04:35:53,860 --> 04:35:54,300
I was gonna say.

6678
04:35:54,340 --> 04:35:54,520
Like.

6679
04:35:54,580 --> 04:35:55,360
There might be like.

6680
04:35:55,400 --> 04:35:55,640
Someone.

6681
04:35:55,720 --> 04:35:56,180
That was like.

6682
04:35:56,300 --> 04:35:56,560
Like.

6683
04:35:56,640 --> 04:35:57,520
The chest was broken.

6684
04:35:57,700 --> 04:35:58,460
I got laughed at.

6685
04:35:58,520 --> 04:35:59,420
By my chat.

6686
04:35:59,540 --> 04:36:00,240
I should get.

6687
04:36:00,420 --> 04:36:01,060
I should get.

6688
04:36:01,120 --> 04:36:01,980
15 points.

6689
04:36:02,100 --> 04:36:02,640
If they like.

6690
04:36:02,640 --> 04:36:03,080
To justify.

6691
04:36:03,540 --> 04:36:04,240
My mental.

6692
04:36:05,120 --> 04:36:06,260
For those survival points.

6693
04:36:15,380 --> 04:36:16,340
And get eliminated.

6694
04:36:16,720 --> 04:36:17,240
But like.

6695
04:36:17,260 --> 04:36:17,800
That I mean.

6696
04:36:17,800 --> 04:36:18,220
That inherently.

6697
04:36:18,260 --> 04:36:19,160
They would have lost.

6698
04:36:19,380 --> 04:36:19,760
If.

6699
04:36:19,920 --> 04:36:21,080
Those people got their.

6700
04:36:21,520 --> 04:36:21,900
Designed.

6701
04:36:21,920 --> 04:36:22,220
Point.

6702
04:36:23,780 --> 04:36:24,720
And then I saw.

6703
04:36:24,820 --> 04:36:25,360
My chat.

6704
04:36:25,680 --> 04:36:26,560
Laughing at me.

6705
04:36:26,700 --> 04:36:27,800
That I couldn't.

6706
04:36:27,800 --> 04:36:28,140
Open.

6707
04:36:28,320 --> 04:36:28,820
The chest.

6708
04:36:30,260 --> 04:36:31,160
At the end of the day.

6709
04:36:32,540 --> 04:36:33,160
None of us.

6710
04:36:33,160 --> 04:36:33,900
Can get mad at each other.

6711
04:36:34,040 --> 04:36:34,380
And.

6712
04:36:34,500 --> 04:36:34,880
If.

6713
04:36:34,880 --> 04:36:35,680
We decide.

6714
04:36:35,760 --> 04:36:36,280
To do.

6715
04:36:36,320 --> 04:36:36,840
A doll game.

6716
04:36:37,040 --> 04:36:37,420
We.

6717
04:36:37,620 --> 04:36:38,400
Shut our mouths.

6718
04:36:38,520 --> 04:36:39,420
And just play the doll game.

6719
04:36:39,540 --> 04:36:40,300
If they eliminate.

6720
04:36:40,420 --> 04:36:41,000
30 people.

6721
04:36:41,120 --> 04:36:41,840
If you get eliminated.

6722
04:36:41,840 --> 04:36:42,500
Or you survive.

6723
04:36:43,700 --> 04:36:44,020
Fine.

6724
04:36:44,280 --> 04:36:44,940
Five day event.

6725
04:36:45,000 --> 04:36:45,500
Starting tomorrow.

6726
04:36:45,900 --> 04:36:46,220
Fine.

6727
04:36:46,260 --> 04:36:47,060
Just start it over.

6728
04:36:47,860 --> 04:36:48,780
Five more days.

6729
04:36:49,100 --> 04:36:49,620
Back to back.

6730
04:36:49,900 --> 04:36:50,020
What was the point of this argument?

6731
04:36:50,020 --> 04:36:51,040
If we're just gonna settle.

6732
04:36:51,140 --> 04:36:52,080
With what was originally.

6733
04:36:52,300 --> 04:36:52,820
Agreed upon.

6734
04:36:53,260 --> 04:36:54,240
Like no one should get mad.

6735
04:36:54,340 --> 04:36:55,040
At each other.

6736
04:36:55,280 --> 04:36:55,860
Like us.

6737
04:36:56,040 --> 04:36:56,360
Players.

6738
04:36:56,540 --> 04:36:57,080
Should get mad.

6739
04:36:57,140 --> 04:36:57,520
At each other.

6740
04:36:57,640 --> 04:36:58,500
The only person.

6741
04:36:59,060 --> 04:37:00,140
To be frustrated at.

6742
04:37:00,260 --> 04:37:00,820
Is the people.

6743
04:37:00,880 --> 04:37:01,620
Who allowed the game.

6744
04:37:01,680 --> 04:37:02,080
To be played.

6745
04:37:02,160 --> 04:37:02,480
Like that.

6746
04:37:02,620 --> 04:37:03,020
It's the only.

6747
04:37:03,880 --> 04:37:04,360
That's exactly.

6748
04:37:04,380 --> 04:37:04,760
What I said.

6749
04:37:04,800 --> 04:37:05,340
At the end of my stream.

6750
04:37:05,400 --> 04:37:05,640
As well.

6751
04:37:05,700 --> 04:37:06,500
Nobody should be.

6752
04:37:06,520 --> 04:37:08,440
If we did the dog game.

6753
04:37:08,480 --> 04:37:08,740
Tomorrow.

6754
04:37:08,960 --> 04:37:09,580
And I agree.

6755
04:37:10,160 --> 04:37:11,220
It has always been.

6756
04:37:11,220 --> 04:37:11,520
An issue.

6757
04:37:11,560 --> 04:37:11,900
With rivals.

6758
04:37:12,040 --> 04:37:12,840
It always will be.

6759
04:37:12,920 --> 04:37:13,180
An issue.

6760
04:37:13,200 --> 04:37:13,600
With rivals.

6761
04:37:13,760 --> 04:37:14,020
Because.

6762
04:37:14,120 --> 04:37:14,680
I don't understand.

6763
04:37:15,040 --> 04:37:16,300
Nothing happened.

6764
04:37:16,540 --> 04:37:18,920
They just argued.

6765
04:37:19,240 --> 04:37:23,440
For the sake of.

6766
04:37:23,560 --> 04:37:23,960
Arguing.

6767
04:37:24,520 --> 04:37:25,600
It just went.

6768
04:37:25,660 --> 04:37:26,620
With the original intent.

6769
04:37:26,760 --> 04:37:26,940
Like.

6770
04:37:27,280 --> 04:37:27,680
Pieces.

6771
04:37:27,720 --> 04:37:28,200
Of RNG.

6772
04:37:28,880 --> 04:37:29,480
And like.

6773
04:37:29,640 --> 04:37:30,300
Random factors.

6774
04:37:30,600 --> 04:37:31,540
That could boost.

6775
04:37:31,660 --> 04:37:32,780
Like a random player.

6776
04:37:32,820 --> 04:37:32,940
To be better.

6777
04:37:32,940 --> 04:37:33,720
What kind of drops.

6778
04:37:33,760 --> 04:37:34,180
Is there.

6779
04:37:34,220 --> 04:37:34,700
For Minecraft.

6780
04:37:35,740 --> 04:37:36,020
Apparently.

6781
04:37:36,260 --> 04:37:37,040
For money.

6782
04:37:37,060 --> 04:37:37,680
We all want.

6783
04:37:37,700 --> 04:37:38,460
To try our best.

6784
04:37:38,680 --> 04:37:38,720
Oh.

6785
04:37:38,880 --> 04:37:39,580
Another thing.

6786
04:37:39,640 --> 04:37:40,100
I just learned.

6787
04:37:40,240 --> 04:37:40,740
I don't even know.

6788
04:37:40,760 --> 04:37:41,180
If this conversation.

6789
04:37:41,280 --> 04:37:41,540
Is still going.

6790
04:37:41,600 --> 04:37:42,020
Sorry to interrupt.

6791
04:37:42,240 --> 04:37:42,360
Go ahead.

6792
04:37:42,560 --> 04:37:43,100
There you go.

6793
04:37:44,540 --> 04:37:45,100
The hunters.

6794
04:37:45,200 --> 04:37:45,860
This wasn't said.

6795
04:37:45,860 --> 04:37:46,200
In the rules.

6796
04:37:46,380 --> 04:37:46,940
The hunters.

6797
04:37:47,220 --> 04:37:48,020
If you kill a person.

6798
04:37:48,100 --> 04:37:48,740
You were at a minute cooldown.

6799
04:37:48,880 --> 04:37:49,560
Where you couldn't kill anybody.

6800
04:37:49,840 --> 04:37:50,120
Yeah.

6801
04:37:50,160 --> 04:37:50,780
We already talked about that.

6802
04:37:50,860 --> 04:37:51,040
Yeah.

6803
04:37:51,120 --> 04:37:51,400
Yeah.

6804
04:37:51,500 --> 04:37:51,780
Yeah.

6805
04:37:52,320 --> 04:37:54,180
There was multiple rounds.

6806
04:37:54,260 --> 04:37:54,640
I would have got.

6807
04:37:54,680 --> 04:37:55,340
Like 15 points.

6808
04:37:55,420 --> 04:37:55,980
There was two rounds.

6809
04:37:55,980 --> 04:37:56,720
There was a terrible.

6810
04:37:56,720 --> 04:37:57,760
There was one round.

6811
04:37:57,900 --> 04:37:58,180
Tell us that.

6812
04:37:58,280 --> 04:37:58,480
I don't know.

6813
04:37:58,500 --> 04:37:59,340
I wouldn't tell us that.

6814
04:37:59,340 --> 04:38:00,100
I don't know why.

6815
04:38:00,140 --> 04:38:00,940
That wouldn't be like.

6816
04:38:01,540 --> 04:38:02,580
They should have said that in the rules.

6817
04:38:02,860 --> 04:38:03,140
Well.

6818
04:38:03,240 --> 04:38:04,040
And like round one.

6819
04:38:04,140 --> 04:38:04,580
Round one.

6820
04:38:04,620 --> 04:38:05,120
I already said.

6821
04:38:05,160 --> 04:38:06,380
Like I was getting stood on.

6822
04:38:06,440 --> 04:38:07,520
By a guy that was on kill cooldown.

6823
04:38:07,680 --> 04:38:08,180
And I had no idea.

6824
04:38:08,180 --> 04:38:08,740
I had no idea.

6825
04:38:09,380 --> 04:38:10,140
There was a.

6826
04:38:10,180 --> 04:38:11,280
That chest with the key.

6827
04:38:11,560 --> 04:38:12,500
There was just one of them.

6828
04:38:12,540 --> 04:38:13,300
Standing in front of there.

6829
04:38:13,380 --> 04:38:13,780
And I was like.

6830
04:38:13,840 --> 04:38:14,980
I'm going to get these five points.

6831
04:38:15,080 --> 04:38:16,060
Just to get these five points.

6832
04:38:16,140 --> 04:38:16,900
And if he kills me afterwards.

6833
04:38:17,120 --> 04:38:17,440
Oh well.

6834
04:38:17,900 --> 04:38:19,280
And he just looked at me.

6835
04:38:19,380 --> 04:38:19,960
And I was like.

6836
04:38:20,340 --> 04:38:20,700
All right.

6837
04:38:20,840 --> 04:38:21,120
My guy.

6838
04:38:21,120 --> 04:38:22,240
Like got me up.

6839
04:38:22,300 --> 04:38:22,860
Like thanks.

6840
04:38:22,940 --> 04:38:23,280
I guess.

6841
04:38:23,400 --> 04:38:23,840
All right.

6842
04:38:23,860 --> 04:38:24,020
Bye.

6843
04:38:24,200 --> 04:38:24,900
And I left.

6844
04:38:25,080 --> 04:38:26,140
But now that you mentioned.

6845
04:38:26,200 --> 04:38:27,160
Once I realized that.

6846
04:38:27,200 --> 04:38:28,020
Like I killed him.

6847
04:38:28,040 --> 04:38:28,440
I had cool.

6848
04:38:28,600 --> 04:38:29,200
Kill cooldown.

6849
04:38:29,340 --> 04:38:30,380
I realized it now.

6850
04:38:30,480 --> 04:38:30,780
That like.

6851
04:38:30,840 --> 04:38:31,620
That guy probably just.

6852
04:38:31,680 --> 04:38:32,980
Literally couldn't kill me.

6853
04:38:33,480 --> 04:38:33,840
Yeah.

6854
04:38:35,700 --> 04:38:36,480
But that's a.

6855
04:38:36,580 --> 04:38:37,740
They should have put that in the rules.

6856
04:38:38,480 --> 04:38:39,220
That's really weird.

6857
04:38:39,280 --> 04:38:40,300
That they didn't add the cooldown.

6858
04:38:40,420 --> 04:38:41,020
Stuff to the rules.

6859
04:38:41,140 --> 04:38:41,640
But inherently.

6860
04:38:41,780 --> 04:38:42,800
That was a part of the game.

6861
04:38:42,960 --> 04:38:43,360
And like.

6862
04:38:43,520 --> 04:38:44,020
That's like.

6863
04:38:44,140 --> 04:38:44,440
I mean.

6864
04:38:45,340 --> 04:38:46,060
Sucks to be you.

6865
04:38:46,140 --> 04:38:46,640
If you could have gotten.

6866
04:38:46,800 --> 04:38:47,720
A triple combo.

6867
04:38:48,900 --> 04:38:49,500
I guess.

6868
04:38:51,320 --> 04:38:52,040
Jesus Christ.

6869
04:38:52,440 --> 04:38:53,180
Hitboxes were cooked.

6870
04:38:53,280 --> 04:38:53,640
Or something.

6871
04:38:53,960 --> 04:38:54,260
And then.

6872
04:38:54,740 --> 04:38:55,100
Like.

6873
04:38:55,500 --> 04:38:56,620
After round three.

6874
04:38:57,460 --> 04:38:58,400
I like realized.

6875
04:38:58,720 --> 04:38:58,900
I was like.

6876
04:38:58,980 --> 04:38:59,160
Oh.

6877
04:38:59,380 --> 04:38:59,700
Like.

6878
04:38:59,940 --> 04:39:00,860
There's just a cooldown.

6879
04:39:01,040 --> 04:39:02,040
I didn't see it.

6880
04:39:02,100 --> 04:39:02,740
But there is.

6881
04:39:03,140 --> 04:39:03,500
Yeah.

6882
04:39:03,500 --> 04:39:03,640
Yeah.

6883
04:39:03,700 --> 04:39:03,780
I mean.

6884
04:39:03,820 --> 04:39:05,020
I think that the number one mistake.

6885
04:39:05,160 --> 04:39:06,460
Is a classic Twitch Rivals move.

6886
04:39:06,520 --> 04:39:07,060
And the number one mistake.

6887
04:39:07,200 --> 04:39:08,220
Is that at the end of the game.

6888
04:39:08,320 --> 04:39:08,640
They said.

6889
04:39:08,680 --> 04:39:09,780
That they were going to redo the game.

6890
04:39:09,940 --> 04:39:10,540
Which they should have.

6891
04:39:10,620 --> 04:39:10,820
Yeah.

6892
04:39:10,960 --> 04:39:12,160
The fact that they said.

6893
04:39:12,260 --> 04:39:12,980
Before the game ended.

6894
04:39:13,120 --> 04:39:13,480
Classic.

6895
04:39:13,880 --> 04:39:14,480
Do things.

6896
04:39:15,140 --> 04:39:15,500
Classic.

6897
04:39:15,880 --> 04:39:16,480
Rivals move.

6898
04:39:21,120 --> 04:39:21,220
And then.

6899
04:39:21,220 --> 04:39:21,920
The going into the third.

6900
04:39:22,060 --> 04:39:23,060
End of the third round.

6901
04:39:23,200 --> 04:39:23,600
I was still.

6902
04:39:23,660 --> 04:39:24,560
I never was a hunter.

6903
04:39:24,840 --> 04:39:26,100
I was out of the top.

6904
04:39:26,120 --> 04:39:26,620
Bottom 30.

6905
04:39:26,760 --> 04:39:27,100
And I was like.

6906
04:39:27,140 --> 04:39:27,340
Perfect.

6907
04:39:27,500 --> 04:39:28,140
I'm surviving.

6908
04:39:28,320 --> 04:39:28,520
Cool.

6909
04:39:28,620 --> 04:39:28,860
Whatever.

6910
04:39:29,380 --> 04:39:29,920
And then.

6911
04:39:29,940 --> 04:39:30,940
I did my two challenges.

6912
04:39:31,280 --> 04:39:31,820
And then.

6913
04:39:31,840 --> 04:39:32,160
I was like.

6914
04:39:32,220 --> 04:39:32,400
Okay.

6915
04:39:32,440 --> 04:39:33,360
I'm at 30 points.

6916
04:39:33,540 --> 04:39:33,860
Awesome.

6917
04:39:33,940 --> 04:39:34,740
I think I'll be fine.

6918
04:39:35,080 --> 04:39:35,820
And then immediately.

6919
04:39:35,900 --> 04:39:36,380
When they said.

6920
04:39:36,460 --> 04:39:36,780
Oh yeah.

6921
04:39:36,820 --> 04:39:37,240
By the way.

6922
04:39:37,760 --> 04:39:38,140
We're not.

6923
04:39:38,180 --> 04:39:38,660
This doesn't count.

6924
04:39:38,800 --> 04:39:39,480
I was immediately like.

6925
04:39:39,580 --> 04:39:39,700
Well.

6926
04:39:39,800 --> 04:39:41,120
I was probably going to survive.

6927
04:39:41,120 --> 04:39:41,800
And now.

6928
04:39:42,200 --> 04:39:42,860
I'm not.

6929
04:39:44,760 --> 04:39:45,120
Again.

6930
04:39:46,920 --> 04:39:47,460
I mean.

6931
04:39:47,500 --> 04:39:48,400
If they end up.

6932
04:39:48,400 --> 04:39:48,740
Choosing.

6933
04:39:48,780 --> 04:39:49,640
To do whatever they want.

6934
04:39:49,720 --> 04:39:49,960
Tomorrow.

6935
04:39:50,140 --> 04:39:50,500
Like.

6936
04:39:51,240 --> 04:39:52,040
That's their choice.

6937
04:39:52,220 --> 04:39:52,860
And whatever.

6938
04:39:53,020 --> 04:39:53,460
And if I lose.

6939
04:39:53,540 --> 04:39:54,200
In the doll game.

6940
04:39:54,280 --> 04:39:54,460
Tomorrow.

6941
04:39:54,520 --> 04:39:55,300
If they end up doing that.

6942
04:39:55,500 --> 04:39:56,020
I mean.

6943
04:39:57,120 --> 04:39:57,680
Oh well.

6944
04:39:58,360 --> 04:39:58,820
You know.

6945
04:39:58,920 --> 04:39:59,220
Like.

6946
04:39:59,820 --> 04:40:00,180
GG.

6947
04:40:00,280 --> 04:40:00,580
I guess.

6948
04:40:00,920 --> 04:40:01,280
No.

6949
04:40:02,300 --> 04:40:03,500
For 50 minutes.

6950
04:40:04,280 --> 04:40:04,640
Everybody.

6951
04:40:04,660 --> 04:40:05,020
Just.

6952
04:40:05,260 --> 04:40:05,620
Accepted.

6953
04:40:05,640 --> 04:40:05,820
It.

6954
04:40:06,080 --> 04:40:06,440
.

6955
04:40:06,440 --> 04:40:06,600
.

6956
04:40:06,600 --> 04:40:06,860
.

6957
04:40:10,240 --> 04:40:10,560
.

6958
04:40:10,560 --> 04:40:10,700
.

6959
04:40:10,700 --> 04:40:11,300
Did everyone have.

6960
04:40:11,380 --> 04:40:11,760
Have fun today?

6961
04:40:12,800 --> 04:40:13,120
Yeah.

6962
04:40:13,280 --> 04:40:14,020
I had fun.

6963
04:40:14,240 --> 04:40:14,580
I mean.

6964
04:40:14,580 --> 04:40:15,200
I was like.

6965
04:40:15,220 --> 04:40:15,460
Yeah.

6966
04:40:15,520 --> 04:40:16,180
With all my friends.

6967
04:40:17,080 --> 04:40:17,480
It's good.

6968
04:40:17,580 --> 04:40:18,340
So fun to play.

6969
04:40:18,400 --> 04:40:19,100
Even if it didn't really.

6970
04:40:19,140 --> 04:40:19,420
Function.

6971
04:40:19,420 --> 04:40:19,680
All that.

6972
04:40:19,740 --> 04:40:19,880
Well.

6973
04:40:20,880 --> 04:40:21,660
I've never been.

6974
04:40:21,720 --> 04:40:22,280
More stressed.

6975
04:40:22,320 --> 04:40:22,700
In a Minecraft.

6976
04:40:22,800 --> 04:40:22,960
Event.

6977
04:40:23,080 --> 04:40:23,700
Ever in my life.

6978
04:40:23,820 --> 04:40:24,360
Before playing.

6979
04:40:24,440 --> 04:40:25,320
This dumb.

6980
04:40:25,440 --> 04:40:25,760
Stupid.

6981
04:40:25,780 --> 04:40:26,080
Stinky.

6982
04:40:26,160 --> 04:40:26,340
Event.

6983
04:40:27,760 --> 04:40:28,700
I was happy.

6984
04:40:28,760 --> 04:40:28,960
When I.

6985
04:40:28,960 --> 04:40:30,960
I thought I survived the main for day four, but...

6986
04:40:30,960 --> 04:40:33,920
Bro, did we just go through the five stages of grief for Minecraft players?

6987
04:40:34,220 --> 04:40:35,560
Like, for the Minecraft players?

6988
04:40:35,800 --> 04:40:37,960
Just going through the stages of grief there?

6989
04:40:38,280 --> 04:40:39,580
Bro, what was the point?

6990
04:40:39,960 --> 04:40:42,620
What was the point of this?

6991
04:40:42,620 --> 04:40:46,240
There's never, like I said earlier, there's never going to be an answer at least that makes everyone happy.

6992
04:40:46,420 --> 04:40:50,940
There will be 5, 10, 20 people on either side that will be pissed tomorrow.

6993
04:40:51,240 --> 04:40:51,640
I think they hit an acceptance.

6994
04:40:51,640 --> 04:40:52,860
Or whenever they make their final decision.

6995
04:40:53,740 --> 04:40:55,260
They've hit the acceptance stage.

6996
04:40:55,420 --> 04:40:55,820
That's just inherently going to happen.

6997
04:40:55,820 --> 04:40:57,720
And that sucks, but...

6998
04:40:59,400 --> 04:41:01,440
Acceptance has been reached.

6999
04:41:02,280 --> 04:41:04,100
If it works in your favor, if it doesn't...

7000
04:41:05,080 --> 04:41:13,040
Automatically, what ends up happening, whenever there's a problem, immediately the people that were going to get eliminated are going to be like, yes, please, do it again.

7001
04:41:13,260 --> 04:41:17,060
And then the people that survived are obviously going to be like, no, please don't.

7002
04:41:17,060 --> 04:41:19,360
I want to win 70 grand.

7003
04:41:19,700 --> 04:41:22,240
Bro, no, I just wanted $500.

7004
04:41:23,560 --> 04:41:30,160
You got to think about, like, inherently, like, what the idea of this whole entire event was supposed to be.

7005
04:41:31,260 --> 04:41:31,660
And...

7006
04:41:33,600 --> 04:41:34,000
Like...

7007
04:41:35,040 --> 04:41:35,440
Like...

7008
04:41:35,440 --> 04:41:37,240
Am I sure for day 4?

7009
04:41:37,420 --> 04:41:41,080
Like, that we're trying to do that one code thing?

7010
04:41:42,180 --> 04:41:44,320
Like, ended up trying to do it all four rounds?

7011
04:41:44,580 --> 04:41:45,540
That's kind of on them.

7012
04:41:45,680 --> 04:41:47,360
No offense, that's kind of on them.

7013
04:41:47,440 --> 04:41:48,180
Not saying they did.

7014
04:41:48,380 --> 04:41:50,120
I just thought it was stupid!

7015
04:41:51,880 --> 04:41:53,000
Or you thought it was broken?

7016
04:41:53,160 --> 04:41:54,420
Why are you doing it more than once?

7017
04:41:55,820 --> 04:41:56,640
I just thought it is!

7018
04:41:56,980 --> 04:42:00,320
If those people, if they got five extra points and survived, I'd be like, yeah.

7019
04:42:01,400 --> 04:42:02,060
I'd be upset.

7020
04:42:02,340 --> 04:42:10,180
But if they had, like, zero points going into the last round, or, like, zero points just in general, you were going to get out even if you did do that.

7021
04:42:10,360 --> 04:42:11,180
Four times.

7022
04:42:11,580 --> 04:42:12,380
Like, you know what I mean?

7023
04:42:14,280 --> 04:42:14,640
Damn.

7024
04:42:16,160 --> 04:42:16,520
Damn.

7025
04:42:17,160 --> 04:42:17,920
That's not me.

7026
04:42:19,660 --> 04:42:21,800
I don't know how much I laughed at me!

7027
04:42:21,900 --> 04:42:28,380
And if, like, people survived five minutes and didn't get points for that too, they should get those points and then calculate, see what they get.

7028
04:42:28,500 --> 04:42:31,280
And if people survived because of it, W.

7029
04:42:31,900 --> 04:42:35,440
If you don't, you probably wouldn't have survived anyways.

7030
04:42:35,740 --> 04:42:36,120
So...

7031
04:42:38,160 --> 04:42:38,560
Wow.

7032
04:42:39,040 --> 04:42:40,200
I mean, he's not wrong.

7033
04:42:40,480 --> 04:42:42,020
I am surprised I made it this far.

7034
04:42:42,320 --> 04:42:45,100
I'm surprised I got it here.

7035
04:42:45,200 --> 04:42:46,000
I got here.

7036
04:42:48,880 --> 04:42:52,000
That just means tomorrow we get to play three games if we play the dog game.

7037
04:42:52,000 --> 04:42:52,820
Hey.

7038
04:42:53,380 --> 04:42:54,140
Isn't that fun?

7039
04:42:54,760 --> 04:42:55,240
No?

7040
04:42:55,420 --> 04:42:55,840
Okay.

7041
04:42:57,440 --> 04:42:59,420
Guys, is my voice still messed up?

7042
04:42:59,600 --> 04:43:00,080
No.

7043
04:43:00,960 --> 04:43:02,480
What do you think?

7044
04:43:03,360 --> 04:43:04,580
Sorry, I'll meet up again.

7045
04:43:05,360 --> 04:43:07,460
You don't have to meet up.

7046
04:43:07,980 --> 04:43:08,860
No, please do.

7047
04:43:09,260 --> 04:43:15,520
I've been sick for the past three days.

7048
04:43:16,000 --> 04:43:17,860
Alright, guys, I think debate's over.

7049
04:43:18,100 --> 04:43:19,520
Actually, no, it's been more than six months.

7050
04:43:19,820 --> 04:43:21,100
Do you think the debate is over?

7051
04:43:22,000 --> 04:43:23,320
I've been in the rain, bro, and then he got sick.

7052
04:43:23,380 --> 04:43:25,140
Can we leave now?

7053
04:43:25,400 --> 04:43:29,120
Hey, game's game.

7054
04:43:31,600 --> 04:43:32,280
Wow.

7055
04:43:33,140 --> 04:43:34,880
Bro, what a...

7056
04:43:34,880 --> 04:43:37,840
That was... that was crazy.

7057
04:43:38,180 --> 04:43:40,100
That's actually crazy.

7058
04:43:41,080 --> 04:43:45,500
During the entire time, I ordered soup, I ordered a sandwich.

7059
04:43:47,840 --> 04:43:50,780
I caught a genusect on pokeroad.

7060
04:43:52,000 --> 04:43:53,000
I was just listening in.

7061
04:43:53,040 --> 04:43:54,560
I was actually insane.

7062
04:43:55,260 --> 04:43:57,600
Does this happen often in Minecraft?

7063
04:43:59,920 --> 04:44:01,220
Girl, I don't fucking know.

7064
04:44:02,880 --> 04:44:08,900
Bro, the fact that they debated for more than an hour straight.

7065
04:44:09,340 --> 04:44:13,400
But then they had zero... it just went back in a circle.

7066
04:44:13,760 --> 04:44:15,540
They agreed to nothing.

7067
04:44:16,080 --> 04:44:18,340
They actually... they just accepted.

7068
04:44:18,620 --> 04:44:18,740
But it was crazy.

7069
04:44:18,740 --> 04:44:19,060
It was crazy.

7070
04:44:19,420 --> 04:44:22,120
There was one part that I did tune back in.

7071
04:44:22,220 --> 04:44:24,760
And then I heard Viva say some shit.

7072
04:44:24,860 --> 04:44:27,440
Like, guys, actually there was something they didn't tell us.

7073
04:44:27,480 --> 04:44:28,460
For Hunter's set.

7074
04:44:28,520 --> 04:44:29,700
Hunter's set had a one minute cooldown.

7075
04:44:29,920 --> 04:44:32,080
And everyone in Unison said we talked about that.

7076
04:44:32,920 --> 04:44:34,260
That's so true, yeah.

7077
04:44:34,880 --> 04:44:36,800
Yeah, that was so true.

7078
04:44:37,440 --> 04:44:38,660
That was so fucking fun.

7079
04:44:38,920 --> 04:44:40,280
Oh my god.

7080
04:44:41,420 --> 04:44:43,440
That was actually crazy.

7081
04:44:44,500 --> 04:44:46,060
I was so surprised.

7082
04:44:46,520 --> 04:44:47,980
I was like...

7083
04:44:48,740 --> 04:44:50,040
What am I listening to?

7084
04:44:50,440 --> 04:44:52,100
Oh my god.

7085
04:44:52,140 --> 04:44:54,500
Everyone in Unison, they already told us.

7086
04:44:54,640 --> 04:44:55,560
Oh my god.

7087
04:44:55,940 --> 04:44:58,420
Did you see the... the fight?

7088
04:44:58,760 --> 04:45:01,660
The... you know the tweets they linked?

7089
04:45:01,760 --> 04:45:02,660
That was linked to us?

7090
04:45:03,000 --> 04:45:03,360
Yeah.

7091
04:45:03,860 --> 04:45:06,980
I can't believe the Discord got leaked.

7092
04:45:08,480 --> 04:45:10,060
They leaked it on stream.

7093
04:45:10,300 --> 04:45:11,300
Did you know that?

7094
04:45:11,920 --> 04:45:13,460
Yeah, I saw that shit.

7095
04:45:13,780 --> 04:45:15,700
Bro, they actually...

7096
04:45:15,700 --> 04:45:17,100
We're talking about the...

7097
04:45:18,740 --> 04:45:20,380
They called out the Discord fight.

7098
04:45:20,480 --> 04:45:21,840
The Discord chat fight.

7099
04:45:22,140 --> 04:45:26,380
And people were leaking the chat logs on stream.

7100
04:45:26,800 --> 04:45:27,580
Not us.

7101
04:45:27,780 --> 04:45:28,960
We were just telling you guys.

7102
04:45:29,340 --> 04:45:31,540
We just called out who it was.

7103
04:45:31,700 --> 04:45:32,380
But we were just like...

7104
04:45:32,380 --> 04:45:33,200
Oh my god, people are fighting.

7105
04:45:33,800 --> 04:45:35,960
But some people were actually...

7106
04:45:35,960 --> 04:45:43,540
Some streamers that were participating in the Twitch Rivals actually leaked the Discord chat logs on stream.

7107
04:45:44,000 --> 04:45:45,800
It was crazy.

7108
04:45:45,800 --> 04:45:46,180
It was crazy.

7109
04:45:54,090 --> 04:45:56,270
Bro, I'm glad we made it to Day 3, Gumi.

7110
04:45:56,390 --> 04:45:57,310
We would have missed out.

7111
04:45:57,950 --> 04:45:58,350
Yeah.

7112
04:45:58,730 --> 04:45:59,150
We would have.

7113
04:45:59,610 --> 04:46:01,510
Are you coming back for Day 4?

7114
04:46:02,770 --> 04:46:03,710
Yeah, see you tomorrow.

7115
04:46:04,210 --> 04:46:05,370
Let's play the doll game again.

7116
04:46:05,650 --> 04:46:06,570
When will we...

7117
04:46:06,570 --> 04:46:07,170
I'm gonna win.

7118
04:46:09,670 --> 04:46:12,150
I just have to beat a doll game.

7119
04:46:13,130 --> 04:46:15,050
That was like one of the most stressful ones.

7120
04:46:15,610 --> 04:46:15,730
That was like one of the most stressful ones.

7121
04:46:17,550 --> 04:46:18,510
When will we...

7122
04:46:18,510 --> 04:46:19,470
It'll be okay.

7123
04:46:19,630 --> 04:46:20,910
When will we win?

7124
04:46:21,010 --> 04:46:21,070
Alright.

7125
04:46:21,290 --> 04:46:25,250
Okay, I'll see you on Day 4, Gumi.

7126
04:46:25,510 --> 04:46:26,430
What if we're not playing Valorant?

7127
04:46:26,690 --> 04:46:27,390
Wait, what?

7128
04:46:28,090 --> 04:46:28,550
What?

7129
04:46:29,070 --> 04:46:29,590
What?

7130
04:46:30,230 --> 04:46:30,750
What?

7131
04:46:31,050 --> 04:46:32,870
I'll see you on Day 4, Gumi.

7132
04:46:33,390 --> 04:46:34,530
No, how about Valorant?

7133
04:46:34,630 --> 04:46:35,590
Gumi, I just went through!

7134
04:46:37,210 --> 04:46:37,730
Gumi!

7135
04:46:38,250 --> 04:46:38,610
Huh?

7136
04:46:38,970 --> 04:46:39,350
Hello?

7137
04:46:39,450 --> 04:46:42,910
Gumi, this stream could have ended two hours ago.

7138
04:46:45,710 --> 04:46:46,230
Wait.

7139
04:46:47,070 --> 04:46:47,550
Oh.

7140
04:46:49,950 --> 04:46:50,430
Hello?

7141
04:46:50,710 --> 04:46:51,710
Vtuber number 13?

7142
04:46:52,130 --> 04:46:53,090
Hey, that's me.

7143
04:46:53,330 --> 04:46:53,610
Hey, man, I'm a Vtuber.

7144
04:46:53,610 --> 04:46:55,530
I kept, like, I called out, like, three times.

7145
04:46:55,770 --> 04:46:56,650
Like, I...

7146
04:46:56,650 --> 04:47:05,010
I feel like they're like, this Vtuber should not have made it this far, but because of RNG, she's here, too.

7147
04:47:07,910 --> 04:47:12,110
That was so fucking good, they mentioned you, like, multiple times.

7148
04:47:12,110 --> 04:47:12,530
Yeah!

7149
04:47:12,530 --> 04:47:14,490
Like, what the fuck did I do?

7150
04:47:15,030 --> 04:47:15,870
I'm sorry.

7151
04:47:15,870 --> 04:47:18,270
Sorry, I got it because of R&G.

7152
04:47:24,490 --> 04:47:26,210
She eliminated Tubbo.

7153
04:47:33,660 --> 04:47:34,640
Alright, GG's.

7154
04:47:34,720 --> 04:47:35,760
I'm gonna talk to my chat.

7155
04:47:37,680 --> 04:47:38,480
Gumi, please.

7156
04:47:38,780 --> 04:47:39,080
Please.

7157
04:47:39,100 --> 04:47:40,580
I'll play Valorant tomorrow, Gumi.

7158
04:47:41,260 --> 04:47:41,760
Okay!

7159
04:47:42,280 --> 04:47:43,060
Bye, Toki!

7160
04:47:43,340 --> 04:47:44,380
Bye, Gumi!

7161
04:47:44,540 --> 04:47:44,900
Bye-bye!

7162
04:47:47,060 --> 04:47:47,920
Alright, guys.

7163
04:47:48,640 --> 04:47:50,380
That was wild.

7164
04:47:50,560 --> 04:47:51,700
That was actually wild.

7165
04:47:51,960 --> 04:47:56,140
I did not expect today's Minecraft day to be like this.

7166
04:47:59,200 --> 04:48:00,260
Day 4.

7167
04:48:00,540 --> 04:48:03,340
We're back with Day 4.

7168
04:48:08,650 --> 04:48:09,880
Oh my god.

7169
04:48:11,100 --> 04:48:12,680
I can't believe it.

7170
04:48:12,720 --> 04:48:15,560
There's multiple fights going on right now.

7171
04:48:15,680 --> 04:48:16,980
And I'm just like this random...

7172
04:48:16,980 --> 04:48:17,900
I am the random one.

7173
04:48:17,920 --> 04:48:20,620
I'm VTuber number 13 looking in the sidelines.

7174
04:48:20,660 --> 04:48:22,520
Being like, what the hell is going on?

7175
04:48:22,840 --> 04:48:24,360
What the fuck is...

7176
04:48:24,360 --> 04:48:25,160
There's like...

7177
04:48:25,160 --> 04:48:28,700
Sap is trending on Twitter because of the leaks.

7178
04:48:31,340 --> 04:48:37,300
We listened in to a fucking Minecraft debate for an hour.

7179
04:48:37,840 --> 04:48:38,860
Oh my god.

7180
04:48:40,560 --> 04:48:41,800
Also, like, yeah.

7181
04:48:41,960 --> 04:48:46,280
I only streamed the call because everybody else was streaming the call anyway.

7182
04:48:46,460 --> 04:48:47,340
So I was like, alright.

7183
04:48:50,000 --> 04:48:50,560
That was weird.

7184
04:48:50,820 --> 04:48:52,360
Oh my god.

7185
04:48:53,200 --> 04:48:54,260
That was crazy.

7186
04:48:55,580 --> 04:48:58,160
It was pretty civilized though.

7187
04:48:58,460 --> 04:49:03,740
That was pretty civilized though, for a debate... for a debate about a game.

7188
04:49:03,960 --> 04:49:08,020
I think my favorite part was when they ended it with like did you guys have fun?

7189
04:49:08,400 --> 04:49:10,440
After people were like mad.

7190
04:49:10,800 --> 04:49:12,140
Did you guys have fun?

7191
04:49:19,440 --> 04:49:20,880
Oh my god.

7192
04:49:21,100 --> 04:49:25,380
Anyway, guys, for those who are new here, welcome to my channel.

7193
04:49:25,700 --> 04:49:27,340
We're not a drama channel.

7194
04:49:27,540 --> 04:49:28,740
We just got roped in.

7195
04:49:28,980 --> 04:49:30,940
I'm literally not a Minecraft player.

7196
04:49:31,200 --> 04:49:35,040
Like, I got invited to the Minecraft Twitch Rivals, and I was like, that's fun.

7197
04:49:35,040 --> 04:49:44,060
And I think I'm one of the few streamers that are not part of the Minecraft community that's made it this far, that's still in it.

7198
04:49:44,180 --> 04:49:46,040
Because, like, there's not a lot of us left.

7199
04:49:46,740 --> 04:49:48,720
There's definitely not a lot of us left.

7200
04:49:51,560 --> 04:49:56,960
So, um, so, uh, and by the way, please check me out on YouTube.

7201
04:49:57,080 --> 04:50:02,460
I usually stream on Twitch when it comes to Twitch events, which was this event, so that's why I'm here.

7202
04:50:03,520 --> 04:50:04,780
Uh, and I...

7203
04:50:05,360 --> 04:50:06,540
That's why I'm here.

7204
04:50:06,820 --> 04:50:10,300
Uh, so check me out on YouTube.

7205
04:50:10,680 --> 04:50:12,400
You guys wanna know when I stream on Twitch?

7206
04:50:12,680 --> 04:50:18,620
It'll be, uh, it'll be like, uh, tomorrow at 12pm, same time.

7207
04:50:18,860 --> 04:50:21,100
I will be on...

7208
04:50:21,100 --> 04:50:26,600
Uh, I will usually tweet out whenever uh, I usually tweet out whenever the...

7209
04:50:26,600 --> 04:50:29,240
whenever I'm streaming on Twitch, so please follow me on Twitter.

7210
04:50:29,380 --> 04:50:32,760
I heard that my YouTube's figure is up now.

7211
04:50:33,060 --> 04:50:34,540
I don't know if it's up for pre-order now.

7212
04:50:35,040 --> 04:50:41,380
So, like, I don't know if Imod has made a command for it, or anything, but yes, I will tweet out the announcement for my YouTube's figure.

7213
04:50:41,820 --> 04:50:45,940
Um, it came out during the middle of all of this, so I couldn't.

7214
04:50:46,400 --> 04:50:48,300
Oh, it opens for pre-orders on the 11th.

7215
04:50:48,340 --> 04:50:50,380
So, it opens for pre-orders on the 11th.

7216
04:50:50,600 --> 04:50:52,260
So, yeah, I'll tweet that out later.

7217
04:50:52,500 --> 04:50:55,520
Sorry, in the midst of all this drama, like, I couldn't...

7218
04:50:55,520 --> 04:50:56,740
It's Minecraft drama.

7219
04:50:56,860 --> 04:50:59,420
The thing is, it's Minecraft drama, and my...

7220
04:50:59,420 --> 04:51:04,340
The thing about Minecraft drama is that there's drama, um, almost every week.

7221
04:51:04,340 --> 04:51:07,400
To the point where, like, people are gonna forget about it so soon.

7222
04:51:07,600 --> 04:51:12,200
Like, I swear, even somebody who's not even part of the Minecraft community, I always see Minecraft drama.

7223
04:51:12,420 --> 04:51:14,120
So, like, I feel like it just...

7224
04:51:14,740 --> 04:51:16,700
There's always stuff happening.

7225
04:51:20,560 --> 04:51:24,520
There's always stuff happening, so, like, I'm not surprised.

7226
04:51:26,880 --> 04:51:27,400
Um...

7227
04:51:27,400 --> 04:51:29,360
So, yeah, that was, like...

7228
04:51:29,360 --> 04:51:30,200
That was fun.

7229
04:51:30,980 --> 04:51:31,500
That...

7230
04:51:36,810 --> 04:51:38,290
That was fun.

7231
04:51:42,470 --> 04:51:43,370
Anyway, guys.

7232
04:51:43,610 --> 04:51:44,110
Yeah!

7233
04:51:44,250 --> 04:51:44,990
I had a great time.

7234
04:51:45,150 --> 04:51:46,930
As always, everybody, stay hydrated.

7235
04:51:47,510 --> 04:51:48,370
Poster check.

7236
04:51:48,590 --> 04:51:49,670
Get up and move around.

7237
04:51:49,950 --> 04:51:51,130
To get that blood flowing.

7238
04:51:51,310 --> 04:51:53,390
And if you stay up for me, head to bed.

7239
04:51:53,610 --> 04:51:54,990
Cause you deserve it.

7240
04:51:55,130 --> 04:51:56,750
What a rest week, guys.

7241
04:51:57,290 --> 04:51:59,250
What a rest week.

7242
04:52:02,230 --> 04:52:05,570
The people on YouTube sure are missing out right now.

7243
04:52:05,650 --> 04:52:06,070
The people on YouTube sure are missing out right now.

7244
04:52:06,090 --> 04:52:11,730
Did not expect my run for this event to lead this way.

7245
04:52:12,010 --> 04:52:12,850
Hey, guys.

7246
04:52:12,990 --> 04:52:14,270
See you guys next time, everybody.

7247
04:52:14,610 --> 04:52:15,710
Bye, guys.

7248
04:52:16,170 --> 04:52:16,770
Bye!
