1
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:47,110
HELLO EVERYBODY!

2
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:48,150
HELLO HELLO!

3
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:49,770
Sorry, I wasn't finished singing!

4
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:51,050
I mean, no, no, no!

5
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:54,710
Did you guys enjoy your, like, eighth loop of that song?

6
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:58,590
We were live this entire time!

7
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:00,010
We were looping, guys!

8
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:00,550
Right?

9
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:01,110
Yeah!

10
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:04,690
Yeah, we were looping!

11
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:06,950
For eight times in a row!

12
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:09,610
Wait...

13
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:11,590
What's wrong with my audio?

14
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,160
Am I better?

15
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:29,700
What's wrong?

16
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:39,780
I'm so sorry!

17
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:06,960
Hello?

18
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,400
Is it better?

19
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:14,180
Hello, is it better?

20
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:15,740
Oh, okay.

21
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:16,940
Oh, thank god.

22
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:17,660
I'm so sorry.

23
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:18,800
What was it?

24
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,040
What happened?

25
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:21,020
I was like, no!

26
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:22,640
No!

27
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,700
Okay, so what happened was that...

28
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,220
Um...

29
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:29,600
I had to restart my GoXLR.

30
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:33,560
And what happened was that...

31
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,060
Uh...

32
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,220
No, what happened was that...

33
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:40,780
Was that I was eating...

34
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:44,080
I ordered Jollibee's for dinner.

35
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:45,080
Sorry, dinner time.

36
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,960
And obviously, dad is very food motivated.

37
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,740
So he went into my room.

38
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,600
Because he was like, can I have some chicken?

39
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:55,040
And I was like, no, you're allergic.

40
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,500
And he's like, I don't want chicken!

41
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:59,500
And then he, like, bumped into...

42
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,040
He, like, bumped into...

43
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:03,560
Um...

44
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,080
The...

45
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,170
The power cable for the GoXLR.

46
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:09,560
So the GoXLR reset itself.

47
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:10,620
Because it was like...

48
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:11,860
It was like, what the fuck?

49
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,960
And then he bumped into it.

50
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:15,200
So the GoXLR reset itself.

51
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:16,000
But I didn't realize...

52
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,840
I thought it would be fine.

53
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:17,920
Because it was still on.

54
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:18,700
So...

55
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,040
Because I thought it was...

56
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,040
I thought it would be fine.

57
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,500
Because my GoXLR was still on.

58
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,660
But I didn't realize it, like...

59
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:27,180
It, like, fucked it up.

60
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:31,420
So...

61
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:32,880
But it's okay.

62
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:33,600
It's fine now.

63
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,480
I freaked out.

64
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,560
I was like, what are you guys talking about?

65
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,780
What do you mean?

66
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,760
What do you mean?

67
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:42,680
There's something wrong.

68
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:43,880
Also, what is my BGM?

69
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:45,340
Let's see.

70
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,240
Alright, free.

71
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:51,620
I have no idea what BGM this is, so...

72
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:53,840
Oh, this works.

73
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,240
This BGM works.

74
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:56,440
We're gonna listen to that.

75
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,920
Alright, anyway, so...

76
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,380
It has been...

77
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:03,820
Almost...

78
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:05,140
How many months has it been?

79
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,100
Since I announced the contest.

80
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,700
The waifu cup contest.

81
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,620
It's been a lot of months.

82
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:11,900
Maybe 5 plus months.

83
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:14,180
We...

84
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:17,040
We received...

85
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,620
700 plus!

86
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,000
By the way, I don't know the exact number.

87
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:23,300
But it was...

88
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,640
700 plus...

89
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,680
Entries.

90
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:30,540
So, it was a lot of work.

91
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,240
My assistant...

92
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,100
Actually...

93
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,540
Helped me out with...

94
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:37,120
Going through the first pass.

95
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:39,700
So, my assistant...

96
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:41,660
Helped me...

97
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:43,740
Narrow it down...

98
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:45,660
To a hundred...

99
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:47,340
And sixteen...

100
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,560
Files.

101
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,220
Art files to look through to.

102
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:53,180
Because, obviously...

103
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:54,740
Like, it was a lot.

104
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,960
So, my assistant looked through the criteria.

105
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,460
So, there was a criteria.

106
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,240
We had to look through the right file.

107
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:01,340
The right format.

108
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:03,560
The right logo and everything.

109
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:07,660
So, from 700 plus...

110
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:09,680
To a hundred...

111
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,660
And sixteen entries.

112
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:13,420
And from there...

113
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:14,820
I took over...

114
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:17,300
And narrowed it down...

115
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,120
To...

116
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,320
Thirty-five...

117
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,160
Thirty-four entries.

118
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:24,740
Within those thirty-four...

119
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:27,580
We selected twenty-two...

120
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:30,280
To win the eight-thousand dollar prize money.

121
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,540
So, it's not like...

122
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:33,020
They're all gonna get eight-thousand dollars.

123
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:35,480
By the way, the prize pool for this...

124
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,520
Is eight-thousand dollars.

125
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:38,340
American.

126
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,460
So, that eight-thousand dollars...

127
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:43,360
Is divided amongst...

128
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,600
Twenty-two participants.

129
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,020
I think it's twenty-two.

130
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:48,220
Twenty...

131
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,680
It's a lot.

132
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:56,360
Let me make sure I'm saying the right things.

133
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:57,380
Because...

134
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:59,240
It took a long time.

135
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,400
One of the reasons...

136
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,340
Why this took...

137
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:05,800
Forever...

138
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,980
Was that...

139
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,360
Obviously, narrowing it down...

140
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,220
Was very difficult.

141
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,020
Narrowing it down all the entries...

142
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:18,020
Was incredibly difficult.

143
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:19,760
And also...

144
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:20,940
Behind the scenes...

145
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,440
A lot of stuff was...

146
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:25,220
A lot of stuff came up behind the scenes.

147
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,760
So, basically...

148
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,420
Something would come up...

149
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:31,440
That I couldn't finish judging.

150
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,900
So, things kept coming up behind the scenes.

151
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,080
But eventually...

152
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,700
We were able to do it.

153
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,420
I was able to sit down...

154
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:40,980
For...

155
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:43,000
I think it took me...

156
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:44,840
One to two weeks.

157
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:46,540
Overall...

158
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:49,240
Overall, it took me two weeks of judging...

159
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,940
To finally get to...

160
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:53,580
Not like in two weeks...

161
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:55,360
It was like overall...

162
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,160
If we added all the time I spent...

163
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,700
When I had time to judge...

164
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:01,680
It took two weeks to narrow it down...

165
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,500
To...

166
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:05,380
To like 35...

167
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:05,900
What was it?

168
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:06,320
35?

169
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:07,580
34.

170
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,500
So, I narrowed it down to 34.

171
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,940
But only 22 entries...

172
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:13,940
Are going to get prize money.

173
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:15,580
So, for those who don't know...

174
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,280
Um...

175
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:19,080
First place...

176
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,180
We end up picking...

177
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,940
Two artworks...

178
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:24,780
For first place.

179
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:25,960
Because it was so difficult.

180
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,200
So, in the beginning...

181
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,660
It was three second places...

182
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:33,580
Um, but in the end...

183
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:35,520
I decided...

184
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,020
Well, it was me.

185
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:36,940
I was the final pick.

186
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,660
I was the final judge.

187
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:41,220
So, all the artworks... I was the final judge.

188
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,420
Um, I picked...

189
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,240
Two artwork pieces...

190
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,880
To be the...

191
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,440
To be first place.

192
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:52,140
And those two art pieces...

193
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:53,820
Will be on one cup.

194
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:54,760
One waifu cup.

195
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:57,340
So, the front side and the back side...

196
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:59,240
Will have two different illustrations.

197
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:01,200
Because it was very difficult.

198
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:03,180
It was really hard to choose between the two.

199
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:05,420
So, first place...

200
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:08,220
Not only do they get the waifu cup...

201
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:08,680
Uh...

202
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:11,020
Being on the waifu cup...

203
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:14,140
They also get $2500 each.

204
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:15,800
So...

205
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:16,720
First...

206
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,040
The two first place placements...

207
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,620
Will get $2500 each person.

208
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:23,700
Um, second place...

209
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:24,720
Gets $1000.

210
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,760
Uh, third place... $500.

211
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:30,280
Fourth to fifth place...

212
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:30,720
$250.

213
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,940
And sixth to 22nd...

214
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:34,560
Oh, sorry.

215
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:35,380
Sixth to 20th...

216
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:37,480
Sixth to 20th...

217
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,500
Will get $100.

218
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,020
So, um...

219
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:44,280
The first to fifth place winners...

220
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,120
We've contacted all the artists...

221
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:48,240
That got placed in first to fifth...

222
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,620
And I think we contacted...

223
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:52,380
I don't know if we contacted the artists for sixth to 20th...

224
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:54,280
But for the first to fifth...

225
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,120
Um...

226
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,000
Not only...

227
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,580
Not only...

228
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:00,720
Would...

229
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,820
The two first place winners...

230
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:05,960
Get to be on the waifu cup...

231
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,400
They will also...

232
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:08,760
Individually...

233
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,160
Will be on t-shirts.

234
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,220
So you can buy...

235
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:13,880
The designs on a t-shirt.

236
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,860
And not all...

237
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:16,960
And then I think...

238
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,680
I'm not sure if it's gonna change...

239
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:22,600
But the reason why we contacted first to fifth...

240
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,660
Is that...

241
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:25,760
If you buy the bundle...

242
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,080
I think it's the bundle...

243
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:29,960
You'll get a gacha for stickers...

244
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:32,640
That will include the first to fifth...

245
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,700
Prize winners.

246
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:36,640
So, you could have like a sticker...

247
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,980
That was based off the design...

248
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:38,960
Of first to fifth.

249
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:41,020
It's like...

250
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:42,140
I think it's gacha...

251
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:43,720
Regarding which one you'll get...

252
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:46,200
I'm not sure to finalize the details yet...

253
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,040
But I'll let you guys...

254
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:50,540
I'll explain more later...

255
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,860
The t-shirts are not gacha...

256
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:55,320
It's the stickers...

257
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:57,900
So first and fifth will be...

258
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:00,340
Available to purchase later on...

259
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:01,220
Anyway...

260
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:02,480
I need you guys to know...

261
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,960
It was so difficult...

262
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:07,960
It was incredibly difficult...

263
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,640
I would like to thank my assistant...

264
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,160
For making this form...

265
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,320
For making this powerpoint...

266
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:16,340
To help me with judging...

267
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:18,320
So what I will be showcasing you guys...

268
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:19,940
Right now...

269
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:21,580
Will be like...

270
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:23,320
Not all of them...

271
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,540
Because there's 700 plus entries...

272
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:26,340
But...

273
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,520
I'll be going through...

274
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:31,020
The final round...

275
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:33,340
Where I looked through the entries...

276
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:35,520
So it's like a hundred of them...

277
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:36,820
Hahahaha...

278
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:38,240
Hahahaha...

279
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:40,380
Like I said...

280
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:42,840
I'd like to thank my assistant...

281
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,700
For making this...

282
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:47,680
It was a lot easier to look through...

283
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,000
So as you see...

284
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,620
It says who the artists are...

285
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:53,020
What it looks like in different colors...

286
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:54,560
So the first one obviously...

287
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,000
There's Knight OwO...

288
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,400
By the way...

289
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,240
My criteria...

290
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,920
Of picking...

291
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:04,200
I...

292
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,980
In terms of like...

293
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,740
I looked at...

294
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:10,900
Where I believe...

295
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:13,640
Fits my personality the most...

296
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,200
Because there was some artwork...

297
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,000
That was really really good...

298
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,640
But they didn't place higher...

299
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,380
Because I felt like...

300
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:23,060
Oh I wanted it to fit like...

301
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:25,260
My personality more...

302
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:27,820
So like I didn't place it as high...

303
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:28,900
Like someone might be like...

304
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:31,080
Oh wait but this one looks really well drawn...

305
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,860
But then for like certain...

306
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:34,320
For like products...

307
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,760
I wanted it to fit my personality more...

308
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,840
So it took like... I was looking into that...

309
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,440
As well as the effort that was put into it...

310
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,000
Like how...

311
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,040
Like the effort and everything...

312
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,400
So it was so difficult guys...

313
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,380
It was...

314
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:51,460
It was so difficult...

315
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:52,500
This one's by...

316
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:56,040
Oh my gosh I love the...

317
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,020
I love like the...

318
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:00,620
The details on the dress itself...

319
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:02,180
Like the ruffles and everything...

320
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:04,480
And they include all the dragons and the tomato...

321
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,820
I love how like...

322
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,780
Everybody included...

323
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:09,980
Like elements of different...

324
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:10,820
Elements of me...

325
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:12,200
By the way it's gonna be retro doki...

326
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:16,280
For the main cup...

327
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,060
The waifu cup...

328
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:19,200
It will be retro doki...

329
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,420
But maybe in the future...

330
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:23,640
I have been talking to gamersubs about...

331
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,720
Another product in the future...

332
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,340
With current doki...

333
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:29,880
So there's that...

334
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,460
This one's 7M digital...

335
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:32,560
Oh my gosh this is gonna take a while...

336
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:34,820
But it all looks...

337
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:36,840
It's so difficult...

338
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:39,840
Oh my gosh... Like it all looks...

339
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,620
So good...

340
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,900
Like I love the dynamics...

341
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,280
Of everything...

342
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:48,360
And included the tomato...

343
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,340
And the background too...

344
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:52,260
Like I was like thinking about like...

345
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:54,400
Will it look good on a cup...

346
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,260
You know like I wanted to make sure...

347
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:58,000
The details and everything...

348
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,680
Was uh...

349
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,120
Legible you know legible...

350
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,840
Um so that people can see...

351
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,700
Exactly what it looks like...

352
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:08,320
Cause it's like it's not printed tiny...

353
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,100
But it was more so like you know...

354
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,400
I wanted to make sure that things can be seen...

355
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,160
This one's by 99raisins...

356
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,040
Uh please check out all these...

357
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:16,960

358
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:19,360
Like I said like...

359
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,320
I don't know how long it's gonna take...

360
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,280
Oh my god I'm scrolling...

361
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:23,640
This is...

362
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:27,680
This is...

363
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,920
I also like some artists...

364
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:32,460
Have made like their own background...

365
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:34,160
Like it's not just a regular rectangle...

366
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,140
They actually like...

367
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:38,080
Went out of their way to make like a custom...

368
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,680
Background shape and everything...

369
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,400
Um so like you know...

370
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,160
It's not just a rectangle and stuff...

371
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:46,160
And then there's like the dragons and everything...

372
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:48,020
There's this one...

373
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:49,140
I'm underneath the water...

374
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:50,040
I'm pressed up...

375
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:50,960
You can see the...

376
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,640
This is by...

377
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:56,560
Oh there's also...

378
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,480
So like I said...

379
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,300
Some artists submitted multiple drawings...

380
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:03,920
Um it was actually crazy cause like...

381
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,480
There are artists that submitted multiple...

382
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,220
That uh got...

383
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:09,660
It was so difficult...

384
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,020
But they could only have one artwork...

385
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:12,960
That won...

386
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:16,060
And because they could only have one artwork that won...

387
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:19,120
Um actually liked both of their pieces...

388
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:19,840
Um...

389
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:20,880
So like there are some...

390
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,060
Lots of artists that submitted more than one entry...

391
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:25,280
And I know there was like two artists...

392
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:27,600
That accidentally gave them...

393
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,380
More than one prize placements...

394
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:31,460
Because I wasn't paying attention to the username...

395
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:33,180
I was looking at the artwork...

396
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:35,480
And then I had to pick one...

397
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:39,000
And then uh move somebody from the honorable mentions...

398
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Up to...

399
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:40,760
Um...

400
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:41,760
Up to the top...

401
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:44,860
So I had to like move people around...

402
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:46,700
Um just cause it was so difficult...

403
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:48,860

00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:51,000

And I wanted to pick both...

407
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:56,700
But I can't cause I want to give everybody a chance...

408
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:59,260
I really wanted to give everybody a chance to...

409
00:15:59,260 --> 00:15:59,920

410
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,560

I picked like different elf...

421
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:26,620
Like I wanted it not to be the same outfit...

422
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:28,060
So I tried to make sure like...

423
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:30,240
It's different outfits and everything...

424
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:30,500

447
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,320
This one is by...

448
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:16,360
Alley cats...

449
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:18,620

Which is...

453
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:26,720
They did so much this...

454
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,240
They did so much but...

455
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:31,520
Like I like how this pops out of the box...

456
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:33,520
Um please support these artists...

457
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,720

Um...

462
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,900
Oh my gosh...

463
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:45,900
Another one by alley cats...

464
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:48,400
A lot of ultoki there...

465
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,120
I love...

466
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:52,460
Oh my gosh I just love the composition of this...

467
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:55,300
And there's like the sleepy dragon here too...

468
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:57,260
Oh you guys can't see it no...

469
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:57,920
Hahaha...

470
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,380
You guys can't see the bottom...

471
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:03,180
There should be a dragoon down there...

472
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:04,300
At the bottom left...

473
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:06,320
Um this one is also by alley cats...

474
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,820
Guys we're at 10 out of 115...

475
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:09,660
Guys...

476
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,560
We're here for the long run...

477
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:13,020
Hahaha...

478
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:15,060
Until we get to the final...

479
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,420
This one is...

480
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,000
Um...

481
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,060
I do like the inclusion of text too...

482
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,220
Um because like...

483
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:26,040
You know they don't have a lot of color...

484
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,980
Oh my god I didn't notice this but there's tiny dragoons here...

485
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:30,180
Uh but...

486
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:32,340
Um...

487
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,580
I like the way...

488
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:37,440
People like try to creatively...

489
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,380
Sneak in the gamersubs logo...

490
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:41,660
Um there were some people...

491
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:43,700
That did submit their artwork...

492
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:46,040
Where the gamersubs logo had to be drawn...

493
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:48,500
It can't be like copy and pasted randomly...

494
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,180
So...

495
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:50,840
We had to like...

496
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:53,420
I remember my assistant told me that...

497
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:55,740
That was one of the things...

498
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:57,580
That had to be filtered out...

499
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:59,500
Because like we had like guidelines...

500
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,440
About regarding um...

501
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:02,820
Like uh...

502
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:04,580
Acceptable pieces...

503
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:06,200
And it's just...

504
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,600
It's just interesting to see where people like...

505
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,720
Place the gamersubs logo...

506
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,920
And like have it drawn as well...

507
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,900
Like how they drew it too...

508
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:16,640
So it's interesting to see...

509
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:19,820
Um this one is also by Annie019...

510
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:21,020
Um this one...

511
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:21,900
They have like a...

512
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:24,160
Poker card theme...

513
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,600
And then there's the name...

514
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,100
My name here...

515
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,260
And the gamersubs...

516
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:29,540
Oh that's so creative...

517
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:30,600
Wait I didn't notice that...

518
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:33,720
The gamersubs logo is where like my pins are too...

519
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:34,560
On the hat...

520
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,240
And then there's like the little drag...

521
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,460
There's a tomato right here...

522
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:38,220
But you guys don't see it...

523
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,300
But he's like right here...

524
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:47,020
Um but there's the gamersubs logo too...

525
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,920
This one's also by Annie019...

526
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,600
Yes these numbers were like...

527
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,060
The submission number...

528
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:54,240
Of what number they were when they submitted...

529
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,580
So like I said...

530
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:56,740
It was a lot...

531
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:00,180
There's...

532
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:01,780
Ashix...

533
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:03,540
Um...

534
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:05,020
Oh I love the line art...

535
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:07,820
I love like the screen tones they use too...

536
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:10,720
Like a lot of the artists use like different types of screen tones...

537
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,640
Since they only have like...

538
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,800
Black and white...

539
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:16,960
Uh they only have like the usage of black and white...

540
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:17,660
And then...

541
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:20,160
This obviously has to be like transparent...

542
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,540
Like it's not fully...

543
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:23,040
It doesn't have to be yellow...

544
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:24,740
This is...

545
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:27,500
The yellow part is where the liquids are...

546
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,040
So um...

547
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,920
This is where like the...

548
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,600
I guess the gamersub...

549
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,760
Gamersub liquids was gonna be...

550
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:38,140
So it's really creative to see how they did it...

551
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:40,000
So it has to be transparent for...

552
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,300
It to pass through...

553
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:44,180
So the fact that they made the hair...

554
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:46,000
And the trophy yellow is very...

555
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,680
Like transparent is very creative...

556
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,260
So then it would be red hair...

557
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:50,260
Green hair...

558
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:51,400
And blue hair...

559
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,520
They had to keep out cross lines...

560
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:57,800
And...

561
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,100
Oh the dragoons would be yellow...

562
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,720
And then the little buttons too...

563
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,580
The little buttons would have been yellow...

564
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:04,880
Or transparent...

565
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:08,100
I love how people are creative with how...

566
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,820
They put the transparency...

567
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:12,520
Just like where they place it and everything...

568
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:13,980
And then...

569
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:15,380
This reminds me...

570
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:17,040
This art style reminds me of...

571
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:19,020
Gorilla's art style...

572
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:21,000
There's Orochima...

573
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:23,740
Um... I love the...

574
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,400
I just think it reminds me of Gorilla's...

575
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,940
Yeah it's so cool...

576
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:29,580
There's so many different art styles too...

577
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:32,520
I also made sure to pick different art styles...

578
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:33,420
For...

579
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,620
Top 22...

580
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:37,520
And the honorable mentions...

581
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,900
Just because like...

582
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:42,280
I wanted to show a diverse range of styles...

583
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:43,260
To get...

584
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:45,820
For the prize money as well...

585
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:46,920
Um... and...

586
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:50,080
I just wanted some more diversity and stuff when it comes to like...

587
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,520
Whoever gets to the top 22...

588
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:53,800
So...

589
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:54,880
Oh my god...

590
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:56,640
See...

591
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,320
You guys can tell why it's so difficult...

592
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:02,660
This one is also by Orochima...

593
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:03,680
Um...

594
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,060
And it's a different style...

595
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:07,100
Oh I love like...

596
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:08,920
It's just so dynamic in general...

597
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:09,700
Like the pose...

598
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:12,880
Like the top bottom and everything...

599
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,560
And the little dragon over there...

600
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,420
You don't see much but he's over here...

601
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:17,520
And then...

602
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:19,780
Black Buriti...

603
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:23,260
With the little star here...

604
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:24,860
He has so many...

605
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:27,040
There are so many talented artists...

606
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:30,520
Um... I wish I could make all of them into merch but...

607
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:31,020
Um...

608
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:33,320
Unfortunately...

609
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,740
We can't...

610
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:38,040
I really like this one for the fact that the background...

611
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,400
Was incredibly creative...

612
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,580
Cause like... you know...

613
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:43,660
A lot of people could just go with the rectangular box...

614
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:45,740
But they went beyond that...

615
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:46,680
And went with the...

616
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:47,840
Cause like normally...

617
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:52,620
The waifu cups are just like a rectangular box...

618
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:54,220
But I love how creative people...

619
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,280
Have been with like...

620
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:58,060
Going beyond that and like making it...

621
00:22:58,060 --> 00:22:59,900
You know like putting a star at the bottom...

622
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:02,280
And then making the box put like stars around...

623
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:04,000
With the screen tones and everything...

624
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,520
And I love the expression...

625
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,840
The expression was really good as well...

626
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,480
Uh... this one by...

627
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,300
J.O.

628
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:12,320
OSHA from... on Instagram...

629
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,500
They do have a Twitter right here...

630
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:14,920
Uh...

631
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:17,620
But it's like different...

632
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:20,400
But we have the Lunar New Year Doki!

633
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:22,600
Um...

634
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,560
I think every outfit...

635
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:26,480
Almost every outfit...

636
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,500
Is represented in...

637
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:29,600
Uh...

638
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,760
In the final selection...

639
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,580
Because like I said...

640
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:35,840
I wanted every outfit to be represented...

641
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:36,660
So...

642
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:37,600
Oh my god is that an egg?

643
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:38,220
Is that him?

644
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,720
Is that him as a dragon?

645
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:42,000
Why does he have hair?

646
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,080
Why does he...

647
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:48,580
Why does he have hair?

648
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:51,540
That's so cute!

649
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,500
He has hair over there!

650
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,460
Hahaha...

651
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:57,800
Anyway...

652
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:58,600
And there's the...

653
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:01,980
Oh I like how the dragon print...

654
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:04,080
Is also transparent too...

655
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:05,360
Uh...

656
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,460
This is Boreal Yakko...

657
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:10,400
I really like this one...

658
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,340
Hahaha...

659
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:13,820
I just thought it was so...

660
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:16,380
It was just so creative...

661
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:17,760
Hahaha...

662
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:20,960
I remember seeing this...

663
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:21,820
On Twitter...

664
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:22,340
And I was like...

665
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:23,680
Wait that's so cute...

666
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,120
Like the...

667
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,920
The dragoon racing...

668
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,300
With the long goon...

669
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,380
I thought that was...

670
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:31,640
I thought that one was like...

671
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,440
Just super clever...

672
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:33,920
Hahaha...

673
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:37,540
Yeah like the long...

674
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:39,480
The long dragoon...

675
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,260
Like it predicted...

676
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:43,240
It predicted my outfit debut...

677
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:45,300
My new skin suit debut...

678
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:46,720
You know with the wallpaper...

679
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:47,540
With the long drag...

680
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:49,160
Riding the long dragoon...

681
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:51,280
Hahaha...

682
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:51,580
Hahaha...

683
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:56,440
I remember when I saw this on Twitter...

684
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:56,960
And I was like...

685
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,600
Oh my god that's actually so cute...

686
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:00,240
Um...

687
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:03,520
And I really like the...

688
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:04,640
Uh...

689
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:05,820
By the way...

690
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:07,240
No guys by the way...

691
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:09,780
The winners are also in this powerpoint...

692
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:10,500
By the way...

693
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:16,880
That reveals who the winners are...

694
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,800
So like all the ones you see here...

695
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:21,800
The winners are in this powerpoint...

696
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:22,180
It's just...

697
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:24,440
We don't know which one is the winner...

698
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:24,840
Hahaha...

699
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,460
We just don't know which one is which...

700
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:31,340
Hahaha...

701
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:32,140
Hahaha...

702
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:33,960
This is basically...

703
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:36,620
The top 115...

704
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:37,700
Hahaha...

705
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:39,840
Um...

706
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,380
Burnt green tea...

707
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:43,880
The low made outfit...

708
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:46,540
The outfit design was...

709
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:48,120
Adorable...

710
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:50,640
Regarding turning my thief outfit...

711
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,860
Into a...

712
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:54,000
The thief outfit...

713
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,500
Into a regular maid outfit...

714
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:58,920
It's basically almost the same thing...

715
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,120
It's just they changed...

716
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:02,500
A couple little things...

717
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:05,220
That makes it into a maid outfit...

718
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:06,120
Um...

719
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:07,960
There's like...

720
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:10,360
I like the hat too...

721
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,340
I'm here to take your order...

722
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:15,000
And then all the dragoons over there...

723
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:15,680
And like...

724
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:19,140
I'm gonna serve...

725
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:21,440
The dragoons up to be consumed...

726
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:22,960
Hahaha...

727
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:25,100
Hahaha...

728
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:27,200
I don't know why you guys are so happy...

729
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,000
I'm gonna be giving you...

730
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,820
To be eaten...

731
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:32,300
Hahaha...

732
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:35,560
We are literally on a silver platter...

733
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:36,280
Guys...

734
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:39,200
This one is by Chip Oily...

735
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,200
Um...

736
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:43,000
And also in the Lunar New Year outfit...

737
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:43,700
Um...

738
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:47,160
The clouds in the background like this...

739
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,180
That's so cute...

740
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:49,800
Hahaha...

741
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,480
That's so creative...

742
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:55,800
With the clouds and stuff intersecting with the background...

743
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:56,320
Um...

744
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,920
And then a little dragoon...

745
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:00,160
I'm giving you guys a little hug...

746
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,080
Is that cute?

747
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:03,760
Alright...

748
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,100
Um...

749
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:07,880
I really like the fact that...

750
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,860
Oh the hair is done really well...

751
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:10,540
The hair...

752
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:11,520
The eyeliner...

753
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,320
And then there's a little dragoon in the background...

754
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:14,640
Wait I didn't see that...

755
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,640
There's a little dragoon silhouette...

756
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:20,520
So clever...

757
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,460
And then like the trophy...

758
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:23,880
The oshi mark...

759
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:24,440
Uh...

760
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:25,320
And then...

761
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:26,840
The little silhouette...

762
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,620
It's so clever like this...

763
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:29,740
And then the tomato...

764
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:31,680
I love how a lot of people added the tomato...

765
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,880
Oh my god that game is so cool...

766
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,160
It's like oh wait you guys can see it...

767
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,380
Hahaha... it got cut off.

768
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:38,200
But then there's the crown, too.

769
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,900
Alright, there's a clear art.

770
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:50,520
I like how this one's not straight in terms of the other ones.

771
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:52,140
It's a little slanted.

772
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,600
It's a little slanted there.

773
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,520
So it is a lot different.

774
00:27:58,740 --> 00:27:59,880
And the way they like...

775
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,040
Oh my god, the GamerSub logo!

776
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:03,900
It's not the star!

777
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:05,360
It's the GamerSub logo!

778
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:07,480
Oh, it's so creative!

779
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:19,500
Like I said, where people put the GamerSub logo, I just love the creativity the artists have when it comes to where they placed it.

780
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:21,660
And the fact that it's where the star is, too.

781
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:28,080
And you guys are here between the thighs and the screen tone for shading and everything, too.

782
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:31,300
And there's another one by Clear Art.

783
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:33,980
So the one with hugging the dragoons.

784
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:36,120
Dragon plushies.

785
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:38,280
And then the clip is the GamerSub logo.

786
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:43,320
And then all the different forms of the dragoons, too.

787
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,480
Chonky, long goon, egg, and regular goon.

788
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:49,120
And then this one by Crispy Chip.

789
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,040
We have...

790
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:56,020
As I said, I love how Tomato's just there.

791
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,720
My real form is just there.

792
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:05,700
And I love the creative background they have here.

793
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:06,380
And everything.

794
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:07,700
And...

795
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:09,400
And...

796
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:09,800
Oh, wait!

797
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:10,360
The little...

798
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:11,300
Like, the white shading.

799
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:12,240
That's so...

800
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,120
Wait, that's so smart.

801
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:18,320
Like, they added additional shading into the transparency to give it dimension.

802
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:21,080
So there's, like, the extra, like, white...

803
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,640
The white highlights and everything.

804
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:24,020
And...

805
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:24,840
Um...

806
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,600
And, like, for the transparency.

807
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,380
Especially the trophy, too.

808
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,060
The white highlights and the dark...

809
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:31,800
The dark highlights, too.

810
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,240
Um...

811
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:37,700
I recommend copying the left side of the seat so that art is covered less.

812
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:39,220
Left side.

813
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:39,920
Oh, these?

814
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:43,360
Oh, it's not covering that much, to be honest.

815
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:45,720
It's literally just...

816
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,000
It's just the bottom.

817
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:50,740
I swear you guys are not missing much.

818
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:53,100
You guys are not missing much from the artwork, guys.

819
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:54,540
I swear to God.

820
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,880
Like, I did say, oh, it's cut out.

821
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,520
But it was literally just a tiny bit.

822
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:02,500
It's just...

823
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:03,400
It's a very...

824
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:03,920
It's tiny.

825
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:04,920
I swear.

826
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:06,900
I swear, guys.

827
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,560
You're not missing...

828
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:09,120
Okay.

829
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,100
All right.

830
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:11,420
I'll make it...

831
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:13,840
I'll make it so you guys can see it better.

832
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:15,080
Okay, guys.

833
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:16,180
Okay.

834
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:20,540
I'll make it so you guys can see it better.

835
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:23,120
See, I told you.

836
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:24,080
You're not missing much.

837
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:29,960
That's really it.

838
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:31,100
That's all here.

839
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:31,940
Okay.

840
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:32,480
Okay.

841
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:33,920
Ha -ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.

842
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:35,700
Okay.

843
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:38,160
Um...

844
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,220
This is like...

845
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:40,440
Cute, morbidly.

846
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:42,660
Oh, and then there's everybody here at the bottom.

847
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:44,940
Didn't see everybody here.

848
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:46,060
Okay, wait.

849
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:47,460
Maybe you are missing much.

850
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:48,700
Maybe.

851
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:52,240
No, because you're not supposed to be right.

852
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:54,200
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.

853
00:30:58,300 --> 00:30:59,740
Okay, there we go.

854
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:00,880
Ha-ha-ha-ha.

855
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,200
Oh, there we go.

856
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,160
Is that- is that better?

857
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:08,940
Is that- is that- is that- is that better now, guys?

858
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:13,080
Is that, uh, we told you.

859
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:16,240
Well, I didn't want you guys to be right.

860
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,640
You know, I'm the streamer.

861
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:23,180
Sometimes I want to be right.

862
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,640
I want to rewrite history.

863
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:31,400
I like how someone's like, I need all the pixels.

864
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:36,200
I like how the whole gang's here, down here.

865
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:37,420
The whole gang's here.

866
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:39,660
Wait, is this the right one?

867
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:39,840
Okay.

868
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:43,020
This one's by DarlingDCT3.

869
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:46,140
Oh, there's the GamerSauce logo.

870
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:48,520
Her art style is so clean.

871
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:49,480
Oh my gosh.

872
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:54,620
And then this is my accurate- by the way, because I'm wearing a sportswear.

873
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:54,900
Sports bra.

874
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:58,620
This is like the accurate size.

875
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:10,980
Oh my god, wait.

876
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:12,360
Wait, the nails too.

877
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:15,860
I didn't realize there was nail- the- the- like she got the nails in too.

878
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:21,440
Um, this is like one of my older, older outfits, but like pre-Thief outfit too.

879
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:22,400
Um.

880
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:25,340
This is also by Darling.

881
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,700
This is also by Darling.

882
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:30,620
So, uh, in a different outfit.

883
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:36,020
Um, I like how like a lot of people, when they submitted entries, they submitted like entries with different outfits.

884
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:38,880
Just for the sake of like, you know, diversifying.

885
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:41,280
Um.

886
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:43,780
And, oh, it's so cute.

887
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:45,160
I love the little details too.

888
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:47,680
Like you can even have- even the nails are there.

889
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:49,340
Like the little nails sticking out.

890
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,360
And then the stars coming out of the trophy.

891
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:52,240
And then the trophy!

892
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:54,000
GamerSauce logo on the trophy!

893
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:55,940
Oh my god.

894
00:32:56,120 --> 00:33:00,360
And oh my god, this- use the screen tones is so well done from a lot of them.

895
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,220
Um, as the shading.

896
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:07,100
Cause it could just have been like, you know, it could honestly been just like a flat shading.

897
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:14,460
But the fact that a lot of these artists use screen tone to like, um, accentuate the- the shading a lot more.

898
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:15,620
Make it pop out more.

899
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,360
Um, it's a very nice touch.

900
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:18,340
I like the little details.

901
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,780
Uh, this is by DokoroDX.

902
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:21,720
Um.

903
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:24,600
This face is so well done.

904
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:27,220
Uh, I- I- I don't know.

905
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:35,500
It's just the hair details and the way the face is drawn is like incredibly- Like it's- it's like very stylistic.

906
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:38,480
And then like the little smoke from the gun too.

907
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:40,680
Or not from the gun, but like the environment.

908
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:42,040
Um, I don't know.

909
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:42,900
You guys look like ghosts.

910
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:43,720
Maybe you guys like-

911
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,720
You guys are like ghosts.

912
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:50,740
Like the dragoons I killed.

913
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:52,880
And you're haunting me.

914
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:56,220
You're here to haunt me.

915
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:02,260
Um, there's a rock and roll from, uh, Dreams Run Deep.

916
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:07,900
Uh, oh, I like how you guys are like- Just like, groupies.

917
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:11,540
You look like- You guys look like groupies in the show.

918
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:13,460
I just noticed.

919
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:18,660
Let me uh- Let me pop this up, boy.

920
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:19,480
Oh my god.

921
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:21,500
You guys look like you're part of the groupie gang.

922
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:27,180
Let me move- Actually, let me move my- Boop, boop, boop.

923
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:27,680
There we go.

924
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:32,500
By the way, chat, um...

925
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:34,820
When I selected...

926
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:37,140
Uh...

927
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:44,940
Oh my gosh, I just- I- I'm sorry if you guys didn't make it past the first round.

928
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:46,980
When my assistant was judging it.

929
00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:51,700
But we had to narrow it down to 150- Like, we had to narrow it down to 150.

930
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:53,900
Like, I'm sorry.

931
00:34:54,240 --> 00:35:00,120
I'm really sorry if you didn't make it to the first round- Like, the first round of- Of judging.

932
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:04,400
It was very difficult.

933
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:09,540
Uh, this is by EZD.

934
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:13,900
Uh, I like how instead of a gun, they used a water gun.

935
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,740
To be like, PG.

936
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:19,580
They're like, are we allowed to depict guns?

937
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:24,040
In the waifu cup?

938
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:28,100
So they swa- I like to think that's where their mind was.

939
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:33,320
Uh, when they were like, do I use water gun instead of gun?

940
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:37,500
Um, just to make sure, like, it fits.

941
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,880
Oh yeah, she's shooting!

942
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:44,280
Yeah, I'm shooting like- Like I say, she.

943
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:45,700
That's not me.

944
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:50,880
I like how- I like how I'm shooting like- Gamersub liquids into you.

945
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:53,420
I was like, drink some gamersubs!

946
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:55,800
Um...

947
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:58,620
Then there's like the little dragon and the little tomato in the top.

948
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:01,600
Uh, this one's by, uh- Wait.

949
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:02,500
Um...

950
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:04,260
LRESEC.

951
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:05,780
Uh, so...

952
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:08,200
I don't know what it is about the face.

953
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:09,400
The face is like...

954
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:15,340
Just- Just really nicely- It's- The face is just so pretty.

955
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:17,200
Um, in general.

956
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,920
I like how this looks like- You're a Naruto person.

957
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:20,380
Haha!

958
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:21,000
Naruto!

959
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:28,340
Yeah, your eyes go straight to the face when you look at this piece of artwork.

960
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:29,620
And then there's tomato me.

961
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:30,780
Um...

962
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:32,040
I don't know what's wrong with this dragon.

963
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:36,360
He looks like he's- He looks like he is- Oh, she's Naruto instead of me.

964
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:41,840
But- Um, the face is just very captivating.

965
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:44,520
And my eyes go straight to it, which is really nice.

966
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:48,280
And when I saw like the different colors- I really like how it works with different colors.

967
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,640
Especially the background too.

968
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:53,680
I think the background looks really nice with all the different colors and everything.

969
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:55,280
It's not a face.

970
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:55,800
Bop.

971
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:59,300
Um, this one's also by EllerySec.

972
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:05,560
Uh, and the fact that, you know, I'm painting the gamer- I think I- I really like- Oh, and then look!

973
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,180
Look at the top!

974
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:06,740
Look at this!

975
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:08,900
Look at- Oh my god!

976
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:09,420
The top!

977
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:10,800
It's so cute!

978
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:11,780
Haha!

979
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:15,260
I like the little- The little silhouettes!

980
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:16,420
At the top!

981
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:20,360
That's such a little- That's such a cute extra thing, you know?

982
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:23,760
Um, there's such a cute feature over there.

983
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:26,840
Yeah, the little details of the top part here.

984
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:29,620
Um, and then the shade- Oh my gosh, the shading for this.

985
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:30,800
Really well done.

986
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:33,060
Um, this is by EllyWife.

987
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:36,100
But- Uh, haha!

988
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:37,580
Just showing my...

989
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:38,800
Assets.

990
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,400
I don't know what else to say.

991
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:49,760
They- They- They- The- The- I would call- I call this the Marvel DC pose.

992
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:59,680
Cause you know how, like, back in the day, uh, Marvel and DC comic- I don't know if they still do it, but Marvel and DC comic book covers would be like...

993
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:00,580
Boob.

994
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:01,260
Butt.

995
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:05,980
The Black Widow pose!

996
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:06,560
Yeah!

997
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:06,960
Yeah!

998
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:09,540
I call this the Black Widow pose!

999
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:11,660
Haha!

1000
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:14,740
Um, this one's by...

1001
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:16,460
Uh, FluffyCatfish.

1002
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:19,740
I- I really like this unique take they went with it.

1003
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:21,160
Because, um...

1004
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:23,120
I felt like, you know...

1005
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:25,160
Especially with the way they put the text at the bottom.

1006
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:30,280
So people who don't know who I am would be like, Who's this girl- Who is this waifu on the waifu cup?

1007
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:32,580
So they can go straight and be like, Ah, Doki Bird.

1008
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:33,240
Haha!

1009
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:36,860
So, I like that as the touch.

1010
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:43,180
Where- Where you- And then, like, the fact that the gamer sub logo is, like, within the liquid bubbles and everything.

1011
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:44,460
Um...

1012
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:44,980
I...

1013
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:47,080
And then there's the tomato right here.

1014
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:47,480
It's like, hey!

1015
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:50,800
But I like the composition for this.

1016
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:53,480
Just because it's- It is different from the other entries.

1017
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:56,080
Um, and has its own- It's a different theme.

1018
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:57,680
Uh...

1019
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,080
Uh, compared to the others.

1020
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,580
And then there's...

1021
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:03,060
Uh, this one's by...

1022
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:03,800
Flixtamo?

1023
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:06,260
I...

1024
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:08,680
Well, you know what's going on.

1025
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:11,860
I'm just like...

1026
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:12,540
Well...

1027
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:13,120
Yeah.

1028
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:15,040
Yeah!

1029
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:18,580
I like the eyes.

1030
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:19,180
I mean...

1031
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:19,680
Yeah!

1032
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:22,660
Guys, eyes are up here!

1033
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:23,620
Haha!

1034
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:26,840
The eyes are up here!

1035
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:28,860
We're no- Nothing underneath!

1036
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:32,680
The eyes are up here!

1037
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:33,740
Guys!

1038
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:34,900
Hehehe!

1039
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:39,140
All right, and then there's Guy Keary.

1040
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:40,460
Um...

1041
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:41,240
I like the...

1042
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:44,380
I- I really like how the trophy is drawn.

1043
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:59,660
The thing I liked about this one was the fact that the transparency was very well balanced in a way that the transparency is here, but then it's balanced by other colors in the back too.

1044
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:09,660
And I really loved how the trophy was done with the GamerSub logo here and then the tomato form in the trophy and everything.

1045
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:14,220
Yeah, it's like an anime credit scene or opening.

1046
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:17,520
And everything.

1047
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:19,100
I think we all know who wins.

1048
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:19,960
No, you guys don't understand.

1049
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:29,460
When you see all the... Guys, we're only at entry 38 out of a hundred and...

1050
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:32,860
Guys, we are not even half... Guys, no, you don't understand.

1051
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:34,840
We're not even halfway.

1052
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:41,760
Halfway, chat.

1053
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:47,500
Haha, haha.

1054
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:53,480
This is from Giant Fluffy.

1055
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:55,900
This is a very different art style too.

1056
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:56,880
I like how... Oh my God.

1057
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:57,560
What is this?

1058
00:40:57,640 --> 00:41:01,000
Oh, the GamerSub logo is on the coins and the trophy!

1059
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:02,900
Yeah!

1060
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:05,180
So all the dragons are here.

1061
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:08,540
This is a very different style from the other styles that we've seen.

1062
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:11,460
And then there's like the coin, the GamerSub logo is on the coins.

1063
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:13,380
And then, you're in my hat right there!

1064
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,620
You're gonna have a safe landing!

1065
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:18,220
All the other dragons are gonna die, but like, especially the egg.

1066
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:22,060
But like, don't worry, you have the Hatter's Cushion!

1067
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:25,420
You're gonna live!

1068
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:29,680
This one's by John Fluffy.

1069
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,300
And we have here... wait, am I dead?

1070
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:34,880
Wait, wait a minute.

1071
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:37,400
The evil is no more.

1072
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:39,860
So instead of a water gun, I have a real gun now.

1073
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:47,820
So I have a real gun now instead of a water gun.

1074
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:51,240
I like the background, I like the screen tone of it.

1075
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:53,900
Oh my gosh, there's so many screen tones.

1076
00:41:53,960 --> 00:42:00,060
I like how it looks like a manga, like a panel from a manga as well.

1077
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:02,500
Get down!

1078
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:04,980
No, he's alive!

1079
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:06,240
I'm alive, guys!

1080
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:09,740
I'm just sleeping.

1081
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:12,320
So this is by GrimSilvers.

1082
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:15,700
And the tomato is just sleeping, guys.

1083
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:16,640
I'm just sleeping.

1084
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:19,200
And honestly, like... oh my god.

1085
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:20,000
Whoa.

1086
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:28,140
Anyway...

1087
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:38,340
I really like all the details on this one too, especially the colors and the shading.

1088
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:42,260
And how the clothes were drawn in general.

1089
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:46,140
It's almost been an hour, we're only 30 in.

1090
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:47,220
It's so over.

1091
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:49,820
Saigo, thank you for the super chat.

1092
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:50,900
Thank you, thank you.

1093
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:54,200
Guys, they're all so good.

1094
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:58,020
They're all really good.

1095
00:42:58,220 --> 00:43:01,340
Look, I'm building up the anticipation and the hype.

1096
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:03,800
And then there's another one by GrimSilvers.

1097
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:07,440
The details on this one is really nice, especially the shading in general.

1098
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:12,900
And... oh my gosh, I love how... I love how Meimei is drawn here.

1099
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:14,620
Oh my gosh, she's so cute.

1100
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:16,840
And then the outfit transparency too.

1101
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:18,520
That's so cute.

1102
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:21,600
And then the... you're like... the little...

1103
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:23,500
Oh my god, there's the tomato dragon!

1104
00:43:23,580 --> 00:43:25,520
I don't know what the last one is, but I assume it's an egg.

1105
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:28,540
But like the... I love the dessert for this.

1106
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:30,780
Like each of the details on this is so pretty.

1107
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:32,800
And then the gamer sub logo is the glasses.

1108
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:35,380
This is also by Grim.

1109
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:38,540
GrimSilvers sent in a lot of entries and they were all really good.

1110
00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:39,620
Um...

1111
00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:41,600
As you can tell...

1112
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:44,000
This one is dedicated to like...

1113
00:43:44,290 --> 00:43:46,400
A particular set of fans.

1114
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:47,980
Um...

1115
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:50,340
That's...

1116
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:51,700
That's all I'll say.

1117
00:43:55,180 --> 00:43:58,620
Sadly, I'm not one of those types of fans.

1118
00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:04,900
So it didn't give GrimSilvers an upper hand when it came to like the judgement of this particular entry.

1119
00:44:05,180 --> 00:44:06,460
So um...

1120
00:44:06,460 --> 00:44:10,980
He didn't bribe me with anything regarding like particular interests there.

1121
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:11,780
Uh...

1122
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:15,560
But like I said, like all his entries...

1123
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:16,840
The details are just...

1124
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:18,200
Like really pretty.

1125
00:44:19,580 --> 00:44:20,180
Um...

1126
00:44:20,180 --> 00:44:22,800
This one is from Hattie Ruto.

1127
00:44:23,580 --> 00:44:24,180
Uh...

1128
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:25,340
This one is...

1129
00:44:25,340 --> 00:44:26,940
This outfit we don't see quite often.

1130
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:27,780
We don't see...

1131
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:28,680
A lot of people...

1132
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:30,700
When we looked at the outfits...

1133
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:31,900
It was mostly...

1134
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:32,280
Uh...

1135
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:33,680
People will focus on...

1136
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:35,120
Alt girl Doki.

1137
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:36,180
But nobody...

1138
00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:36,700
Uh...

1139
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:37,420
Really...

1140
00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:38,220
Um...

1141
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:40,740
Has noticed like the other outfits.

1142
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:42,940
Which this one was included in one of them.

1143
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:43,740
Um...

1144
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:44,420
This is...

1145
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:44,780
I...

1146
00:44:44,780 --> 00:44:45,240
I don't know.

1147
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:46,380
Comfy Doki?

1148
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:47,220
I don't know what...

1149
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:47,620
How...

1150
00:44:47,620 --> 00:44:48,660
What to call this outfit.

1151
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:49,980
Uh...

1152
00:44:51,820 --> 00:44:52,780
Sister Doki?

1153
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:54,820
I guess we could call it Sister Doki.

1154
00:44:55,220 --> 00:44:55,700
Uh...

1155
00:44:57,960 --> 00:44:58,440
Sayso?

1156
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:00,700
Do we call it Sayso Doki?

1157
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:01,980
Um...

1158
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:03,340
So I guess we'll call it...

1159
00:45:03,340 --> 00:45:04,800
Either Sayso or Sister.

1160
00:45:05,860 --> 00:45:07,420
Do we call it Sayso...

1161
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:08,960
Sayso Doki?

1162
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:10,580
Okay.

1163
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:10,720
This one is...

1164
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:10,740
Okay.

1165
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:10,980
So...

1166
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:12,660
This is Sayso Doki.

1167
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,200
So we don't see this...

1168
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:15,300
Outfit a lot.

1169
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:15,800
But...

1170
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:16,400
It's very...

1171
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:16,980
Simple.

1172
00:45:17,140 --> 00:45:18,000
But like...

1173
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:18,480
Um...

1174
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:19,800
It looks really nice.

1175
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:20,160
Uh...

1176
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:20,740
In its simplicity.

1177
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:21,660
Uh...

1178
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:22,560
Especially with the...

1179
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:24,460
I like the line art of it too.

1180
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:25,600
The line art of...

1181
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:26,320
Of this one.

1182
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:27,360
Line art is very hard.

1183
00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:28,500
So I really appreciate it.

1184
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:29,940
And this one is by...

1185
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:30,380
Uh...

1186
00:45:30,380 --> 00:45:31,220
Hitominty.

1187
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:33,800
Another Sayso Doki.

1188
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:34,360
But you...

1189
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:35,380
Dragons are in it too!

1190
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:37,780
Dragons are there too!

1191
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:38,960
Uh...

1192
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:39,460
Like...

1193
00:45:39,460 --> 00:45:40,080
Doki.

1194
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:41,120
Hahaha!

1195
00:45:41,580 --> 00:45:41,680
Hahaha!

1196
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:43,360
This was...

1197
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:44,500
Incredibly cute.

1198
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:46,120
Especially the star eyes.

1199
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:49,400
I love the star eyes added in for the transparency.

1200
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:50,720
And...

1201
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:51,120
Um...

1202
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:52,820
The fact that you guys are all here too.

1203
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:53,620
So...

1204
00:45:53,620 --> 00:45:54,560
It looks like a...

1205
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:55,940
A logo almost.

1206
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:57,280
Uh...

1207
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:58,080
With like...

1208
00:45:58,080 --> 00:45:59,160
The symmetry and everything.

1209
00:45:59,380 --> 00:46:01,340
And then you see the GamerSupp logo on the headband!

1210
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:03,820
Guys we're almost halfway.

1211
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:04,760
Guys...

1212
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:05,380
Stay strong.

1213
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:06,280
Hahaha!

1214
00:46:06,660 --> 00:46:09,800
At least you guys get to see a lot of beautiful art along the way.

1215
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:10,760
This is also by Hito.

1216
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:11,660
But...

1217
00:46:11,660 --> 00:46:12,580
I guess this is...

1218
00:46:12,580 --> 00:46:12,960
Like...

1219
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:14,660
More show based off of Apex.

1220
00:46:14,740 --> 00:46:15,220
With the...

1221
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:15,840
Ape...

1222
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:16,440
The wingman.

1223
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:17,560
And...

1224
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:17,840
The...

1225
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:18,360
Hahaha!

1226
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:21,340
I like how it's so different between the two.

1227
00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:22,740
This one's more like...

1228
00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:23,280
Sayso.

1229
00:46:23,420 --> 00:46:24,280
And then...

1230
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:25,940
Pre-Overwatch Doki!

1231
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:27,240
That...

1232
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:27,640
That's true.

1233
00:46:27,820 --> 00:46:29,300
Lolly thank you for the super chat!

1234
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:29,780
Thank you!

1235
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:30,440
Thank you!

1236
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:31,800
And this one...

1237
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:32,600
Is like...

1238
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:33,140
Um...

1239
00:46:33,140 --> 00:46:34,180
Regular Doki.

1240
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:34,980
Hahaha!

1241
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:37,000
Hahaha!

1242
00:46:37,460 --> 00:46:38,020
Hahaha!

1243
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:39,400
Anyway...

1244
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:40,440
Um...

1245
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:40,980
But yeah...

1246
00:46:40,980 --> 00:46:42,040
Different styles too.

1247
00:46:42,220 --> 00:46:42,740
Like...

1248
00:46:42,740 --> 00:46:45,900
You can tell there's different styles that went into the two of these.

1249
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:46,720
Um...

1250
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:47,480
This one by...

1251
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:48,220
I am...

1252
00:46:48,220 --> 00:46:48,900
Patty Quinn!

1253
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:51,640
Um...

1254
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:52,720
I love the expression.

1255
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:54,100
It's so joyful.

1256
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:54,860
Hahaha!

1257
00:46:55,060 --> 00:46:57,540
And the way the hair is done with the highlights too.

1258
00:46:57,860 --> 00:46:58,900
Like the high...

1259
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:01,100
Like the extra shading in the hair to add more dimension.

1260
00:47:01,340 --> 00:47:04,260
The fact that people added extra shading and everything.

1261
00:47:04,460 --> 00:47:05,440
Just to like...

1262
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:07,080
Make the hair pop out more.

1263
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:07,720
I...

1264
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:08,540
I love it.

1265
00:47:08,580 --> 00:47:10,860
I just love the extra-ness people went to.

1266
00:47:10,900 --> 00:47:11,300
Especially...

1267
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:11,900
And the screen tone.

1268
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:14,020
I just love the extra stuff people went into.

1269
00:47:14,140 --> 00:47:14,880
Because they didn't have...

1270
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:16,340
They didn't just make it like super flat.

1271
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:17,440
Uh...

1272
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:19,260
And this one's by...

1273
00:47:19,740 --> 00:47:20,220
Uh...

1274
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:22,120
Inana?

1275
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:23,760
I assume...

1276
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:24,280
Sorry if I...

1277
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:26,080
I'm so sorry if I butchered your name!

1278
00:47:26,180 --> 00:47:27,300
I'm really sorry!

1279
00:47:28,060 --> 00:47:28,520
Ah!

1280
00:47:28,780 --> 00:47:30,180
The background's really pretty.

1281
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:31,220
I love the...

1282
00:47:31,220 --> 00:47:31,940
Um...

1283
00:47:31,940 --> 00:47:32,500
The fact...

1284
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:36,200
The fact that the background is themed towards...

1285
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:37,060
Um...

1286
00:47:37,060 --> 00:47:37,620
Towards...

1287
00:47:37,620 --> 00:47:37,700
Um...

1288
00:47:37,700 --> 00:47:38,820
It's the outfit as well.

1289
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:39,580
Um...

1290
00:47:39,580 --> 00:47:40,940
And then the GamerSub logo is right here!

1291
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:41,800
It's like...

1292
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:42,700
Where's GamerSub logo?

1293
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:45,040
There's the GamerSub logo right here.

1294
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:45,760
Uh...

1295
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:45,960
Yeah!

1296
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,460
The pose is very dynamic with her...

1297
00:47:47,460 --> 00:47:47,920
With...

1298
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:48,500
Sorry...

1299
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:48,880
Her...

1300
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:49,460
That's me.

1301
00:47:49,580 --> 00:47:50,380
With me holding...

1302
00:47:50,380 --> 00:47:53,460
With me holding the...

1303
00:47:53,460 --> 00:47:54,580
The hair too.

1304
00:47:54,820 --> 00:47:56,080
So it makes the...

1305
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:58,520
The hair much more dynamic guys.

1306
00:47:58,980 --> 00:48:00,620
And then this one is...

1307
00:48:00,620 --> 00:48:01,020
Frale.

1308
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:02,640
You might recognize Frale.

1309
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:03,300
Um...

1310
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:05,860
She has done a lot of Doki Bites for us.

1311
00:48:06,060 --> 00:48:06,620
So...

1312
00:48:06,620 --> 00:48:07,680
It's a very recognizable...

1313
00:48:09,580 --> 00:48:10,100
Artist...

1314
00:48:10,100 --> 00:48:10,440
Uh...

1315
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:11,020
Within...

1316
00:48:11,020 --> 00:48:11,960
The Dragoon community.

1317
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:13,240
Um...

1318
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:13,900
And...

1319
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:16,000
I love the use of screentone for the background.

1320
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:16,940
Cause it makes it...

1321
00:48:16,940 --> 00:48:17,920
Pop so much.

1322
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:18,960
Cause you can see in the...

1323
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:19,620
Extra...

1324
00:48:19,620 --> 00:48:20,900
In the other backgrounds too.

1325
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:22,680
You can see in the other backgrounds...

1326
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:23,440
How much it...

1327
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:23,880
Pop...

1328
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:25,720
The main visuals are popped out.

1329
00:48:26,060 --> 00:48:26,580
Uh...

1330
00:48:26,580 --> 00:48:27,280
With the...

1331
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:27,860
The screen...

1332
00:48:27,860 --> 00:48:29,660
Use the screentones in the back.

1333
00:48:30,180 --> 00:48:30,700
And...

1334
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:31,060
Uh...

1335
00:48:31,060 --> 00:48:31,420
There's me.

1336
00:48:31,780 --> 00:48:32,480
There's me.

1337
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:33,580
And there's also me.

1338
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:35,620
Yeah.

1339
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:37,060
The hair is like...

1340
00:48:37,060 --> 00:48:37,680
Super big.

1341
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:37,960
And bouncy.

1342
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:38,600
And everything.

1343
00:48:38,940 --> 00:48:39,940
It's just very dynamic.

1344
00:48:39,980 --> 00:48:40,560
In general.

1345
00:48:41,300 --> 00:48:42,140
And then there's...

1346
00:48:43,540 --> 00:48:43,920
Eva4111.

1347
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:46,820
There's all of you guys.

1348
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:48,900
Oh!

1349
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:49,740
There's all of you guys cheering!

1350
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:51,740
Look at you with the pom-pom!

1351
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:53,380
Oh my god!

1352
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:54,460
There you are!

1353
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:55,500
Cheering for me!

1354
00:48:55,940 --> 00:48:57,480
And then the gamer sub logo is here.

1355
00:48:57,600 --> 00:48:58,340
And then there's me too.

1356
00:48:58,480 --> 00:48:59,280
And then there's also me.

1357
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:00,460
And then there's...

1358
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:03,100
Yeah.

1359
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:03,800
It looks like...

1360
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:04,200
It looks...

1361
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:05,540
It looks like it comes from...

1362
00:49:05,540 --> 00:49:06,200
Um...

1363
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:06,700
An anime.

1364
00:49:06,980 --> 00:49:07,240
Oh!

1365
00:49:07,260 --> 00:49:07,500
And yeah.

1366
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:07,680
The anime.

1367
00:49:07,700 --> 00:49:08,440
The eyes are really pretty.

1368
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:09,400
Uh...

1369
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:11,400
If you look at the other colors with the...

1370
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:12,620
With the drinks and stuff.

1371
00:49:13,060 --> 00:49:14,100
It's the eye...

1372
00:49:14,100 --> 00:49:14,580
The eye...

1373
00:49:14,580 --> 00:49:15,020
The shape...

1374
00:49:15,020 --> 00:49:19,200
The way the eyes are done so that a little bit of the drink color comes out too.

1375
00:49:19,380 --> 00:49:20,340
I like that.

1376
00:49:20,540 --> 00:49:21,280
I really like that.

1377
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:22,260
Uh...

1378
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:22,440
Yeah.

1379
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:23,880
It looks like straight out of a manga panel.

1380
00:49:24,220 --> 00:49:25,120
Or like anime.

1381
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:26,240
Um...

1382
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:26,540
Yeah.

1383
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:28,000
And then a little shadow too.

1384
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:28,660
Like...

1385
00:49:28,660 --> 00:49:30,340
To add more dimension too.

1386
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:32,640
To separate the background from...

1387
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:33,460
Uh...

1388
00:49:33,460 --> 00:49:33,900
The piece.

1389
00:49:33,940 --> 00:49:34,500
It's so hard.

1390
00:49:34,620 --> 00:49:35,880
Guys we're at...

1391
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:37,100
Remember when I said we're halfway?

1392
00:49:37,340 --> 00:49:38,460
We're not actually halfway.

1393
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:38,920
I lied.

1394
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:41,660
I just wanted to make you guys feel like time is passing by faster.

1395
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:42,360
Uh...

1396
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:45,500
We're...

1397
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:47,820
We're only at...

1398
00:49:47,820 --> 00:49:48,780
We're at 49.

1399
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:51,480
We're at...

1400
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:52,060
Um...

1401
00:49:52,060 --> 00:49:52,700
I'm sorry.

1402
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:54,220
I'm gonna have to go a little quicker guys.

1403
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:55,980
I'm sorry I can't talk long.

1404
00:49:56,740 --> 00:49:57,140
Um...

1405
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:00,320
I wanna give a long commentary on each piece.

1406
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:02,060
But we're gonna have to go a little faster.

1407
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:03,600
I'm sorry.

1408
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:05,220
I can't talk long.

1409
00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:05,460
I'm sorry.

1410
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:05,740
I'm sorry.

1411
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:07,360
I need to do this.

1412
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:08,580
49 out of 115.

1413
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:10,280
Um...

1414
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:11,780
This is by EXO-POD.

1415
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:13,040
Umm...

1416
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:15,900
The fact that I'm like crawling out of your...

1417
00:50:15,900 --> 00:50:19,760
Out of your games of101 Cup, as if I'm on like, uh...

1418
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:20,340
The ring.

1419
00:50:20,620 --> 00:50:21,960
I'm like.��

1420
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:38,160
Sorry, I think we're in it.

1421
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:42,380
I'm pretty sure like we're in a generation where the ring is slowly becoming irrelevant.

1422
00:50:42,820 --> 00:50:47,800
I have not heard about the ring in a long time.

1423
00:50:47,980 --> 00:50:52,920
I know in Japan they made like more more movies regarding the ring.

1424
00:50:53,140 --> 00:50:57,880
But like I think in NA they stopped after the ring tune.

1425
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:07,540
But yeah, it looks like I'm coming out of this the gamer subs cup from the ring.

1426
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:08,420
I really like that though.

1427
00:51:08,460 --> 00:51:10,600
Like I'm like drink your gamer sub.

1428
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,320
This is by JingJang.

1429
00:51:16,180 --> 00:51:19,860
I just like how there's like a lot of stuff going on.

1430
00:51:19,980 --> 00:51:24,520
Like when you just look at it, you can't see everything at once.

1431
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:29,000
So there's like so much so many details going in.

1432
00:51:29,140 --> 00:51:34,160
And the fact that like you can look at it every time and you'll see find something new.

1433
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:41,720
So there's always There's always like more like there's always something new to go into.

1434
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:45,800
Oh my god, I have four favorites now.

1435
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:49,780
We're not even halfway and you already have four favorites.

1436
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:54,920
But yeah, the amount of details on this is just breathtaking.

1437
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:59,980
And this one's about Karas Regaza.

1438
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:03,280
I like how you guys are my ammunition.

1439
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:04,280
Goodbye.

1440
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:09,040
And the expression too, I love the expression on this.

1441
00:52:09,180 --> 00:52:10,880
I know exactly what I'm doing.

1442
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:15,600
You know, I know exactly what's happening.

1443
00:52:18,340 --> 00:52:19,300
It's very fitting.

1444
00:52:19,560 --> 00:52:19,760
Yeah.

1445
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:24,140
But yes, I'm going a lot a little bit faster now.

1446
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:24,720
I'm really sorry.

1447
00:52:26,100 --> 00:52:27,000
There's a lot.

1448
00:52:27,820 --> 00:52:34,360
I like this because the cup is also like the details on the cup too, but this is a different style.

1449
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:42,060
This is by KG Hazard and it reminds me of like retro style for Retro Doki.

1450
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:46,300
And oh yeah, the hair details too, like the curls and everything.

1451
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:52,040
And I love how like she even like did something with drew more like drew stuff for the cup as well.

1452
00:52:52,180 --> 00:52:57,480
And most of the transparency is coming from the liquid coming out of the cup.

1453
00:52:57,480 --> 00:53:00,440
As well as like mini like highlights.

1454
00:53:00,660 --> 00:53:06,220
She used the transparency for the highlights, the eyes, and the liquid coming out of the cup.

1455
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:10,120
Which I feel is like different from a lot of the other entries.

1456
00:53:10,220 --> 00:53:14,140
So I do like how creative they went with it.

1457
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:19,280
And the design itself is like you don't see the retro design style a lot often.

1458
00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:22,780
This is by Kisu VT.

1459
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:25,780
Bang bang.

1460
00:53:28,700 --> 00:53:30,160
The finger guns.

1461
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:31,080
Bang bang.

1462
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:38,340
I like the pose of this because of the fact that the hand is getting closer to the screen.

1463
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:41,060
To the like getting closer to you as well.

1464
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:42,780
So there's like this perspective of everything.

1465
00:53:43,060 --> 00:53:44,980
So I do like the perspective of this.

1466
00:53:45,260 --> 00:53:49,320
And also like the hair too.

1467
00:53:49,460 --> 00:53:51,420
Oh my gosh, the way the hair is done.

1468
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:54,600
The details in the hair is so pretty.

1469
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,020
Like I just love how people draw hair.

1470
00:53:57,020 --> 00:53:58,340
I don't know what else to say.

1471
00:53:58,620 --> 00:54:03,180
Like I'm really jealous of people who can draw hair really well.

1472
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:05,220
Like this is a really well drawn hair.

1473
00:54:05,460 --> 00:54:09,200
Like it looks so nice and smooth.

1474
00:54:09,380 --> 00:54:10,540
I want to touch it.

1475
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:13,640
But don't touch people's hair without like their consent.

1476
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:15,780
Like don't do that.

1477
00:54:15,820 --> 00:54:16,260
That's weird.

1478
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:18,600
Like please ask somebody who won't touch their hair.

1479
00:54:18,740 --> 00:54:20,080
Because that's that's fucking weird.

1480
00:54:20,140 --> 00:54:22,620
If somebody touches my hair randomly.

1481
00:54:22,820 --> 00:54:24,780
Like I'm like bro what the fuck.

1482
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:25,700
Like bro.

1483
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:27,000
Like bro.

1484
00:54:29,180 --> 00:54:29,580
Please.

1485
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:31,840
I will call HR.

1486
00:54:33,820 --> 00:54:34,820
Bro that's weird.

1487
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:37,080
It's weird.

1488
00:54:40,540 --> 00:54:41,140
It's okay.

1489
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:42,640
People can touch my hair.

1490
00:54:42,740 --> 00:54:43,620
I am bald.

1491
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:46,520
This one is by KittyKatVaT.

1492
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:49,200
Look at you guys.

1493
00:54:49,860 --> 00:54:50,820
There you guys are.

1494
00:54:51,020 --> 00:54:51,820
Look at you guys.

1495
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:53,140
Look at the two wagons.

1496
00:54:53,780 --> 00:54:55,400
Oh and then there's a city in the background.

1497
00:54:55,620 --> 00:54:57,000
So it's like based off of like my old videos.

1498
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:57,360
It's all like my old background.

1499
00:54:58,060 --> 00:54:58,780
Jacob A.

1500
00:54:58,800 --> 00:54:59,740
Thank you for the Jacob.

1501
00:54:59,940 --> 00:55:04,020
Oh I like how you had the pronunciation next to your name.

1502
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:05,080
And I still said it wrong.

1503
00:55:05,240 --> 00:55:06,360
Cause I don't read fully.

1504
00:55:09,260 --> 00:55:10,140
Jacob B.

1505
00:55:11,340 --> 00:55:12,140
Jacob B.

1506
00:55:12,140 --> 00:55:13,020
Thank you for the super chat.

1507
00:55:13,120 --> 00:55:13,360
Thank you.

1508
00:55:13,540 --> 00:55:15,660
And your very first super chat too.

1509
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:16,900
Thank you.

1510
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:18,020
Hey doki.

1511
00:55:18,140 --> 00:55:18,920
Today is my birthday.

1512
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:30,420
Guys,

1513
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:38,100
we're almost halfway there for real now.

1514
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:39,020
I'm not joking this time.

1515
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:40,200
We're like at 55.

1516
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:48,660
This one's by Kivonababu.

1517
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:50,380
Okay, Kivonababu.

1518
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:52,820
I love the tomato expression here.

1519
00:55:53,060 --> 00:56:02,980
I also really like the name too that's added there because it lets people know like that's me.

1520
00:56:03,220 --> 00:56:05,680
And then the extra like the background is not just fully white.

1521
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:08,960
They added like little details in there as if there's like smoke coming in the back.

1522
00:56:09,100 --> 00:56:14,060
And the trophy itself too with the extra dimension with the colors.

1523
00:56:14,180 --> 00:56:23,440
And I think like with in the different colors it really like pops out in whatever liquid color you use too.

1524
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:25,220
So this one's really nice.

1525
00:56:25,320 --> 00:56:26,600
I love also the tomato expression.

1526
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:31,160
The tomato expression at the top right?

1527
00:56:31,380 --> 00:56:32,500
It adds a nice touch.

1528
00:56:33,780 --> 00:56:35,840
They also uploaded two artworks.

1529
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:40,960
So this is Alternative Doki.

1530
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:42,620
Same artist.

1531
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:45,000
And I love the stickers on the trophy.

1532
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:48,140
I don't think... I don't know of any of the... I don't remember the other artist.

1533
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:49,460
I don't know if I've done that.

1534
00:56:49,620 --> 00:56:53,180
But like I know like the trophy has been added for a lot of entries.

1535
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:59,100
But the sticker... the cups... the trophy stickers really adds more to it.

1536
00:57:00,300 --> 00:57:02,200
Adds more to the design and everything.

1537
00:57:02,460 --> 00:57:03,880
Also the expression is so cute.

1538
00:57:04,340 --> 00:57:05,720
It's such a cute expression.

1539
00:57:06,740 --> 00:57:07,340
All right.

1540
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:10,120
This one's by kankonpeito.

1541
00:57:10,740 --> 00:57:13,540
And we have Seisodoki again.

1542
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:16,140
And then this time you're all sleeping with me.

1543
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:18,360
We're all... except for you.

1544
00:57:18,900 --> 00:57:21,020
You're... I think you're a plushie.

1545
00:57:22,020 --> 00:57:26,560
I love how the other dragoons are like actual...

1546
00:57:27,380 --> 00:57:29,320
are like drag... like the dragoons.

1547
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:31,280
And then this chonky goon does like...

1548
00:57:32,020 --> 00:57:33,960
put me out of my misery.

1549
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:42,300
Like chonky goons are being crushed right now.

1550
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:44,920
Like please mother.

1551
00:57:49,780 --> 00:57:52,780
He's just... He's just extra cuddly guys.

1552
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:56,820
He's just extra cuddly... deflated goon...

1553
00:57:56,820 --> 00:58:08,800
but I do like the composition of this... like a different take... of just... like it's just like cuddling with the plushie... And just enjoying comfy times with the dragon.

1554
00:58:09,660 --> 00:58:11,720
And this one's by coolit.

1555
00:58:11,980 --> 00:58:13,780
Oh wait it's a circle.

1556
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:15,500
Oh my god.

1557
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:17,300
So instead of a rectangle...

1558
00:58:17,300 --> 00:58:18,880
rectangular box... I'm going alright.

1559
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:18,880
I like it.

1560
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:18,880
Yeah we love this...

1561
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:18,880
we're going with...

1562
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:24,080
It's a circle and the hair is like... it's like a little hula hoop thing, like a ring.

1563
00:58:24,320 --> 00:58:29,880
So the hair is like... the hair is like looped around the hula hoop and everything.

1564
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:35,780
And then the fact that like the shoe is not just full black, so they added the transparency too.

1565
00:58:36,180 --> 00:58:39,700
And oh my god, it's a circle instead of a square!

1566
00:58:41,080 --> 00:58:43,520
That's so creative with what they did here.

1567
00:58:43,980 --> 00:58:46,960
It's almost... yeah, it's almost like Sailor Moon-like too.

1568
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:50,180
It's very... oh, and the gamer slubs is part of the hula hoop.

1569
00:58:50,440 --> 00:58:51,200
The ring.

1570
00:58:51,560 --> 00:58:52,980
Oh, that's so pretty.

1571
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:55,880
Alright, guys, we're halfway now.

1572
00:58:57,540 --> 00:58:58,420
We did it!

1573
00:58:58,500 --> 00:59:00,600
We fucking did it!

1574
00:59:02,730 --> 00:59:10,370
We did it!

1575
00:59:10,510 --> 00:59:12,170
We're actually halfway now!

1576
00:59:12,950 --> 00:59:14,590
Guys, we did it!

1577
00:59:15,130 --> 00:59:17,030
It only took us an hour.

1578
00:59:17,550 --> 00:59:19,270
For real.

1579
00:59:19,470 --> 00:59:20,370
It only...

1580
00:59:20,470 --> 00:59:23,150
It only took us an hour, but we're halfway!

1581
00:59:29,410 --> 00:59:33,010
This is by Kuni17.

1582
00:59:34,810 --> 00:59:36,430
I like the little crown on top.

1583
00:59:36,690 --> 00:59:40,330
It reminds me of like... like doodling and stuff too.

1584
00:59:41,770 --> 00:59:43,770
Took us a lot of time, but we're all... we're there.

1585
00:59:43,970 --> 00:59:45,730
Yeah, it has like Scott Pilgrim!

1586
00:59:45,770 --> 00:59:46,150
You're right!

1587
00:59:46,310 --> 00:59:49,370
It does remind me of Scott... Scott... Scott Pilgrim.

1588
00:59:50,470 --> 00:59:50,670
Scott Pilgrim.

1589
00:59:54,970 --> 00:59:56,190
I like that.

1590
01:00:03,670 --> 01:00:04,750
We're getting erzähled paths.

1591
01:00:05,130 --> 01:00:05,910
When you are happy, it's a bad time.

1592
01:00:05,910 --> 01:00:07,090
We made it to the spinal cord, the lights grew!

1593
01:00:07,090 --> 01:00:08,170
We made it to the spinal cord, and we finished this pregunta verse by songчo!

1594
01:00:08,170 --> 01:00:10,130
Oh, we do not have any taxpayer.

1595
01:00:10,270 --> 01:00:10,430
We did it.

1596
01:00:11,290 --> 01:00:11,850
We did it.

1597
01:00:15,370 --> 01:00:15,770
YohNan sangat!

1598
01:00:20,470 --> 01:00:21,330
That's so cute.

1599
01:00:21,430 --> 01:00:23,490
The bunny has the guitar pick too.

1600
01:00:23,810 --> 01:00:24,990
And then the spotlight.

1601
01:00:25,130 --> 01:00:27,210
You can see like the background is like a spotlight.

1602
01:00:27,510 --> 01:00:28,090
Free shooter!

1603
01:00:28,230 --> 01:00:29,190
Thank you for the super chat!

1604
01:00:29,290 --> 01:00:29,970
Thank you, thank you!

1605
01:00:29,970 --> 01:00:35,090
Mostly a lurker in Clip and Joy, but wanted to say thanks for all the smiles and laughs whenever I need them the most.

1606
01:00:35,170 --> 01:00:36,030
Thank you for the super chat!

1607
01:00:36,090 --> 01:00:36,930
Thank you, thank you!

1608
01:00:36,930 --> 01:00:38,230
And your very first super chat too!

1609
01:00:38,490 --> 01:00:39,630
Thank you so much!

1610
01:00:39,830 --> 01:00:41,790
I really appreciate it for the support.

1611
01:00:42,050 --> 01:00:44,650
I hope you guys are enjoying the stream.

1612
01:00:44,790 --> 01:00:46,790
I know it's like different from my usual stream.

1613
01:00:47,050 --> 01:00:49,190
And we're just looking through art and everything.

1614
01:00:50,470 --> 01:00:55,470
But I still hope you guys are having a good time just enjoying looking at the art.

1615
01:00:55,550 --> 01:01:03,110
And like enjoying the different artworks that were submitted for the Gamers Up Waifu Cup Contest.

1616
01:01:04,290 --> 01:01:05,970
People are just so talented.

1617
01:01:06,570 --> 01:01:09,430
Everybody is just so freaking talented, you know?

1618
01:01:14,090 --> 01:01:15,670
Yeah, we're on 60.

1619
01:01:16,210 --> 01:01:19,570
This is by KuromikiMT.

1620
01:01:19,690 --> 01:01:20,450
Magic the Gatherer.

1621
01:01:20,450 --> 01:01:21,050
MTG.

1622
01:01:21,250 --> 01:01:23,610
I assume MTG means Magic the Gathering, right?

1623
01:01:25,810 --> 01:01:29,930
Anytime I see MTG, I just think Magic the Gathering.

1624
01:01:37,750 --> 01:01:42,730
But yeah, I love how a lot of people who did the background, it's just a solid black.

1625
01:01:42,850 --> 01:01:50,190
But then they did like, they made it more eye-catching with the fact that it's not just a solid black background.

1626
01:01:50,450 --> 01:01:54,090
But they added like, stripes in there to give it more like, pop-ness.

1627
01:01:54,690 --> 01:01:55,570
And then...

1628
01:01:55,570 --> 01:01:56,690
Oh, hey look, there's me too.

1629
01:01:57,010 --> 01:01:57,630
There's me.

1630
01:01:57,810 --> 01:01:58,650
And there's also me.

1631
01:02:03,250 --> 01:02:06,650
Yeah, it's a nice... it's a different style from the usual.

1632
01:02:06,790 --> 01:02:11,530
So I really... I just really like the stylistic choice with the background especially too.

1633
01:02:11,710 --> 01:02:14,410
And then they use the screen tone as the shading here.

1634
01:02:14,810 --> 01:02:17,670
Like there's the extra dark shading and then there's screen tone shading.

1635
01:02:18,310 --> 01:02:20,430
Alright, and then there's Lap Herb.

1636
01:02:20,430 --> 01:02:23,070
Oh, the eyes!

1637
01:02:23,170 --> 01:02:25,970
Wait, this eye style is so... and also gun.

1638
01:02:26,190 --> 01:02:27,490
This is not PG anymore.

1639
01:02:27,810 --> 01:02:31,150
I keep forgetting, like I've been trying to like, mentally...

1640
01:02:31,150 --> 01:02:35,030
I have a mental block right now in terms of swearing because of the sponsor stream earlier.

1641
01:02:35,430 --> 01:02:40,630
You know when I said like, in the beginning of the sponsor stream, I was like, fuck.

1642
01:02:40,830 --> 01:02:41,930
And I was like, wait, can I swear?

1643
01:02:42,210 --> 01:02:49,750
And then my staff... one of my staff members that worked on this sponsor instantly messaged me and was like, you're not supposed to swear.

1644
01:02:58,220 --> 01:03:04,480
They like... they like instantly messaged me.

1645
01:03:07,940 --> 01:03:10,460
It's like, you're not supposed to swear.

1646
01:03:11,980 --> 01:03:17,360
Please, please make sure you don't swear and... or keep it minimum.

1647
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:21,680
So I have... I have like a mental block right now.

1648
01:03:21,740 --> 01:03:26,080
So I... I'll get... I'll get rid of it once soon.

1649
01:03:26,080 --> 01:03:28,060
It just takes me a couple of hours.

1650
01:03:30,280 --> 01:03:33,000
It just... it'll take a couple of hours but...

1651
01:03:33,700 --> 01:03:35,520
I'll start swearing again, don't worry.

1652
01:03:40,300 --> 01:03:45,580
Oh my gosh, and then you got... I like how you have like, your own mini gun too.

1653
01:03:45,720 --> 01:03:47,420
The dragons have their own mini gun.

1654
01:03:47,700 --> 01:03:48,720
And then...

1655
01:03:50,460 --> 01:03:54,620
And then... oh the eye style is like, really pretty in general.

1656
01:03:54,780 --> 01:03:56,060
It's such a pretty eye.

1657
01:03:56,080 --> 01:03:57,320
The eye style in general too.

1658
01:03:58,360 --> 01:04:00,580
Oh my god, and then the gun.

1659
01:04:00,900 --> 01:04:03,220
The gun, oh my god.

1660
01:04:03,640 --> 01:04:04,580
So pretty.

1661
01:04:06,040 --> 01:04:09,120
Alright, and then we have Lemmy Zest here.

1662
01:04:09,500 --> 01:04:09,980
Doki bird.

1663
01:04:10,600 --> 01:04:12,140
The detail is really nice.

1664
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:13,680
I do enjoy...

1665
01:04:13,680 --> 01:04:15,180
Sorry, I have to look at this again.

1666
01:04:15,300 --> 01:04:16,240
I just realized the eye...

1667
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:17,740
Like, it's just something about the eyes.

1668
01:04:18,020 --> 01:04:20,940
Like, the eyes are so captivating here.

1669
01:04:21,320 --> 01:04:23,880
I just... I just can't look away from the eye.

1670
01:04:26,820 --> 01:04:28,440
It's just so captivating.

1671
01:04:30,920 --> 01:04:32,940
Anyway, I love all the little details.

1672
01:04:33,020 --> 01:04:34,820
There's dragoons cheering in the...

1673
01:04:34,820 --> 01:04:36,840
I love the little dragoon pom-pom.

1674
01:04:36,840 --> 01:04:37,480
Look at this guy.

1675
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:38,380
He's like, Hey.

1676
01:04:39,140 --> 01:04:40,460
Hey, I'm here too.

1677
01:04:40,980 --> 01:04:41,460
Hey.

1678
01:04:46,060 --> 01:04:47,180
He's just like, hey.

1679
01:04:48,100 --> 01:04:49,140
But yeah, you guys...

1680
01:04:49,140 --> 01:04:53,080
Like, there's Baobao here, squishing his cheekies with me.

1681
01:04:53,220 --> 01:04:55,260
And then there's me using you as a stress ball.

1682
01:04:55,260 --> 01:04:57,780
I want to make dragoon stress balls in the future.

1683
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,020
Like, whenever I can finally make merch again.

1684
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:00,660
I want to...

1685
01:05:00,660 --> 01:05:02,880
I actually really want to make...

1686
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:05,620
I just really want to make dragoon, like...

1687
01:05:06,760 --> 01:05:07,640
Squishies, you know?

1688
01:05:07,860 --> 01:05:09,660
Like, those stress squishies.

1689
01:05:09,660 --> 01:05:10,580
So I can be like...

1690
01:05:13,240 --> 01:05:15,200
I just think it'd be really cute.

1691
01:05:17,700 --> 01:05:21,040
This is by Linaria Munkin.

1692
01:05:22,080 --> 01:05:22,560
I...

1693
01:05:22,560 --> 01:05:23,340
Oh my gosh.

1694
01:05:23,340 --> 01:05:25,360
I love the expression of the tomato.

1695
01:05:26,340 --> 01:05:27,240
I'll be like...

1696
01:05:27,240 --> 01:05:30,240
I can like, squish the dragoon squishy.

1697
01:05:32,680 --> 01:05:33,140
But...

1698
01:05:34,300 --> 01:05:36,960
I found the tomato expression is really...

1699
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:37,940
It's like...

1700
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:43,100
The tomato expression and...

1701
01:05:43,100 --> 01:05:44,940
Oh my gosh, my expression too.

1702
01:05:45,060 --> 01:05:46,280
Wait, I mean, they're both my expression.

1703
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:49,300
So both of my expressions were really nicely drawn here.

1704
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:50,440
And then I like how...

1705
01:05:50,440 --> 01:05:53,240
For this outfit, a lot of people put the gamer stuff low.

1706
01:05:53,240 --> 01:05:54,260
Like the logo on the star.

1707
01:05:54,420 --> 01:05:56,100
Or replacing the star too.

1708
01:05:56,240 --> 01:05:56,980
Yeah, it's like Kirby!

1709
01:05:57,340 --> 01:05:58,000
It is!

1710
01:05:58,060 --> 01:05:58,760
You're right!

1711
01:05:59,120 --> 01:06:00,580
It's like a little Kirby.

1712
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:03,040
Kirby, Kirby, Kirby.

1713
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:06,960
Freeze,

1714
01:06:10,300 --> 01:06:11,080
thank you for the...

1715
01:06:11,080 --> 01:06:12,160
Welcome to the tomato farm!

1716
01:06:12,340 --> 01:06:12,920
Welcome, welcome!

1717
01:06:13,480 --> 01:06:14,580
Hope you enjoy your stay.

1718
01:06:15,320 --> 01:06:17,320
Okay, this is by Leo Wart.

1719
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:19,680
So, alternative doki.

1720
01:06:19,840 --> 01:06:20,400
Oh my gosh.

1721
01:06:21,020 --> 01:06:22,280
You guys are so...

1722
01:06:22,280 --> 01:06:23,600
Like a lot of the artist...

1723
01:06:23,600 --> 01:06:26,700
The expression is just so...

1724
01:06:26,700 --> 01:06:27,260
Like...

1725
01:06:27,260 --> 01:06:30,680
I just can't keep my eyes off of the expression all the time.

1726
01:06:30,820 --> 01:06:31,220
Because like...

1727
01:06:31,220 --> 01:06:32,960
The way you guys draw faces...

1728
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:34,000
It's just like...

1729
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:34,600
I always just...

1730
01:06:34,600 --> 01:06:35,520
I want to look at the face.

1731
01:06:35,700 --> 01:06:37,100
Like my eyes can't...

1732
01:06:37,100 --> 01:06:40,380
Can't look away from the face a lot of the times.

1733
01:06:40,580 --> 01:06:41,560
And it's so cute.

1734
01:06:42,040 --> 01:06:43,080
It's really cute.

1735
01:06:43,220 --> 01:06:44,580
It's very mischievous too.

1736
01:06:44,820 --> 01:06:47,400
And then the little sparkles like cameras like...

1737
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:48,100
Doki, look over here!

1738
01:06:51,080 --> 01:06:52,460
Look over here, Doki!

1739
01:06:53,360 --> 01:06:54,920
What are you wearing?

1740
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:56,700
Gamers up.

1741
01:06:57,940 --> 01:06:59,880
I'm wearing gamers up.

1742
01:07:00,020 --> 01:07:01,680
Also, I got an update from my assistant.

1743
01:07:02,080 --> 01:07:04,000
The sticker pack is not gacha.

1744
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:07,100
If you buy the bundle, you get the whole five...

1745
01:07:08,380 --> 01:07:10,040
You get all the stickers.

1746
01:07:10,500 --> 01:07:12,780
So, it's not gacha.

1747
01:07:13,140 --> 01:07:14,480
Thank you for the correction.

1748
01:07:15,220 --> 01:07:17,140
But only if you buy the bundle.

1749
01:07:19,740 --> 01:07:47,840
Oh my god you're wearing a little gamer stuff hat and then I don't think the to miss hey I'm like a parasite so this is like retro doki before she got like I'm like the tomato is like a parasite so you know like those like parasites that consume that like consume like insect brains the one that's based off Last of Us is based off of that parasite or fungus.

1750
01:07:48,140 --> 01:07:48,920
That's me.

1751
01:07:50,660 --> 01:07:56,940
So this RetroDoki was just in time to avoid the infection.

1752
01:07:59,240 --> 01:08:00,880
Yeah, the cordyceps.

1753
01:08:01,140 --> 01:08:03,240
I'm basically like a cordyceps.

1754
01:08:09,560 --> 01:08:15,140
Say what you like about the 4Kids, but the Kirby opening was a banger.

1755
01:08:15,300 --> 01:08:18,120
And Meta Knight's English voice actor was a great fit.

1756
01:08:18,380 --> 01:08:19,400
Lali, thank you for the super chat.

1757
01:08:19,460 --> 01:08:20,160
Thank you, thank you.

1758
01:08:20,320 --> 01:08:27,060
Honestly, I think the majority of the 4Kids openings, especially the One Piece one...

1759
01:08:28,180 --> 01:08:32,280
I think 4Kids was really good with making...

1760
01:08:33,240 --> 01:08:38,280
English openings for Japanese songs.

1761
01:08:38,700 --> 01:08:42,200
I feel like... I personally think it's just really well done.

1762
01:08:43,180 --> 01:08:44,620
And they're very catchy.

1763
01:08:45,060 --> 01:08:48,720
I might not have grown up with Butterfly, but come on.

1764
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:52,920
Digimon, Digital Monsters, Digital Monsters Champion.

1765
01:08:53,700 --> 01:08:57,460
We might have like four lines, but like...

1766
01:08:58,920 --> 01:09:01,120
It was at least catchy.

1767
01:09:03,240 --> 01:09:07,060
It was at least... It was at least very catchy.

1768
01:09:09,200 --> 01:09:10,400
Gotta go fast.

1769
01:09:10,860 --> 01:09:12,200
Gotta go fast.

1770
01:09:12,540 --> 01:09:15,080
Gotta go faster, faster, f-f-f-f-faster.

1771
01:09:15,200 --> 01:09:17,820
Sonic, b-b-b-b-sonic.

1772
01:09:19,400 --> 01:09:21,920
They're really easy to sing.

1773
01:09:22,240 --> 01:09:25,800
Yeah, Butterfly sounds beautiful, but like...

1774
01:09:25,800 --> 01:09:27,620
Is it easy to sing?

1775
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:32,820
At least a child.

1776
01:09:33,240 --> 01:09:34,680
Can sing Digimon.

1777
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:42,820
At least a child can sing Digimon.

1778
01:09:43,780 --> 01:09:46,020
Digimon, Digital Monsters.

1779
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:48,440
Digital Monsters Champion.

1780
01:09:51,420 --> 01:09:52,020
Anyway.

1781
01:09:52,580 --> 01:09:55,100
But yeah, this is from Lumenshot.

1782
01:09:55,100 --> 01:09:55,460
Alright.

1783
01:09:56,120 --> 01:09:57,620
This is also by Lumenshot.

1784
01:09:57,780 --> 01:09:59,700
Oh, that's very smug of you.

1785
01:09:59,820 --> 01:10:02,440
Also like, I know like the dragon in this...

1786
01:10:02,440 --> 01:10:04,420
Particular outfit is like very...

1787
01:10:04,420 --> 01:10:06,640
Don't boo her, she's right!

1788
01:10:12,140 --> 01:10:15,480
Wait, there was another song that's like...

1789
01:10:15,480 --> 01:10:16,620
What was that other Digimon song?

1790
01:10:16,760 --> 01:10:17,640
Whenever like...

1791
01:10:17,640 --> 01:10:20,920
Whenever they accomplish something, they play that song.

1792
01:10:21,240 --> 01:10:22,140
God, what was it?

1793
01:10:22,160 --> 01:10:23,800
It was so ca- Not gonna lie.

1794
01:10:25,180 --> 01:10:25,620
Please...

1795
01:10:25,620 --> 01:10:27,300
Please love the art.

1796
01:10:27,300 --> 01:10:28,240
The art are cool.

1797
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:28,700
Very cool.

1798
01:10:28,760 --> 01:10:29,900
Thank you for the super chat, Rip.

1799
01:10:30,020 --> 01:10:30,320
Thank you.

1800
01:10:30,340 --> 01:10:30,940
Thank you.

1801
01:10:30,940 --> 01:10:33,020
Yeah, this art style is really nice.

1802
01:10:33,100 --> 01:10:34,400
And then the details of the hair too.

1803
01:10:34,520 --> 01:10:35,260
The bold...

1804
01:10:35,260 --> 01:10:35,920
The line art...

1805
01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:36,100
Wait.

1806
01:10:36,380 --> 01:10:37,540
The line art...

1807
01:10:37,540 --> 01:10:41,860
Like the boldness of the line art here and the balancing of that is really well done.

1808
01:10:42,460 --> 01:10:43,420
Hey Digimon.

1809
01:10:43,500 --> 01:10:44,220
Hey Digimon.

1810
01:10:46,540 --> 01:10:47,580
Hey Digimon.

1811
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:48,520
That's my butterfly.

1812
01:10:48,900 --> 01:10:49,420
That's...

1813
01:10:51,060 --> 01:10:51,580
That's...

1814
01:10:51,580 --> 01:10:52,960
That's my butterfly.

1815
01:10:53,480 --> 01:10:54,380
Hey Digimon.

1816
01:10:54,460 --> 01:10:54,880
Digimon.

1817
01:10:59,640 --> 01:11:00,600
Digimon.

1818
01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:01,500
You wouldn't ever ask for Durch PR.

1819
01:11:01,500 --> 01:11:02,220
You would never ask for...

1820
01:11:02,220 --> 01:11:03,860
Bang...

1821
01:11:03,860 --> 01:11:04,520
Bang TBD.

1822
01:11:05,860 --> 01:11:07,520
That's my butterfly.

1823
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:10,940
That's my coastal.

1824
01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:28,600
You guys might have Japanese Hamtaro, but we have Ham Ham Hamtaro.

1825
01:11:28,660 --> 01:11:29,600
How did it go?

1826
01:11:29,780 --> 01:11:32,220
How did the English Hamtaro song go?

1827
01:11:40,940 --> 01:11:41,440
I didn't have that.

1828
01:11:45,880 --> 01:11:47,260
I didn't forget.

1829
01:11:47,500 --> 01:11:48,800
It took me a while.

1830
01:11:49,620 --> 01:11:51,080
It's Hamtaro time.

1831
01:11:55,700 --> 01:11:56,400
That's right.

1832
01:11:56,760 --> 01:11:57,780
OK, you guys.

1833
01:11:57,920 --> 01:11:59,060
Oh, I'm sorry.

1834
01:11:59,160 --> 01:12:00,440
This is like I'm sorry.

1835
01:12:00,500 --> 01:12:00,960
This is important.

1836
01:12:03,880 --> 01:12:07,800
We'll be back to schedule the contest result.

1837
01:12:08,240 --> 01:12:08,720
Please.

1838
01:12:09,100 --> 01:12:10,520
Hamtaro song was so good.

1839
01:12:10,620 --> 01:12:10,920
OK.

1840
01:12:10,940 --> 01:12:13,740
OK, the Hamtaro song is so good.

1841
01:12:14,140 --> 01:12:15,240
It's so good.

1842
01:12:16,380 --> 01:12:17,460
OK, is it this one?

1843
01:12:18,020 --> 01:12:19,860
Wait, I got to make sure you guys don't hear it, too.

1844
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:20,120
OK.

1845
01:12:22,340 --> 01:12:23,080
Best friends.

1846
01:12:23,460 --> 01:12:24,580
Ba-ba-ba-dum.

1847
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:25,560
Ba-ba-ba-dum.

1848
01:12:25,580 --> 01:12:26,800
Bye, best friends.

1849
01:12:28,580 --> 01:12:29,640
OK, there you go.

1850
01:12:29,740 --> 01:12:30,420
Oh, there you go.

1851
01:12:30,720 --> 01:12:31,900
Hamtaro opening.

1852
01:12:33,560 --> 01:12:33,960
English.

1853
01:12:35,160 --> 01:12:37,060
This is my... This is...

1854
01:12:37,500 --> 01:12:38,880
This is my Hamtaro.

1855
01:12:42,870 --> 01:12:43,770
Is it this?

1856
01:12:46,610 --> 01:12:47,610
Oh, my God.

1857
01:12:48,950 --> 01:12:49,890
Where is it?

1858
01:12:50,930 --> 01:12:51,830
Where is it?

1859
01:12:52,090 --> 01:12:53,610
Guys, this is so important.

1860
01:12:53,710 --> 01:12:54,570
No, you don't understand.

1861
01:13:00,710 --> 01:13:02,390
OK, the credits, too.

1862
01:13:03,010 --> 01:13:04,330
Ba -ba-ba-dum.

1863
01:13:05,530 --> 01:13:07,830
Ba-ba-ba-dum.

1864
01:13:07,870 --> 01:13:08,850
Ba-ba-ba-dum.

1865
01:13:08,850 --> 01:13:10,150
Ba-ba-ba-dum.

1866
01:13:10,490 --> 01:13:12,030
Ba-ba-ba-dum.

1867
01:13:12,030 --> 01:13:12,690
That's the credits.

1868
01:13:15,750 --> 01:13:20,010
I'm running in, ba-da-ba-da-ba-da-da-dum.

1869
01:13:20,270 --> 01:13:22,390
Ba-da-ba-ba-dum.

1870
01:13:22,390 --> 01:13:23,750
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-dum.

1871
01:13:23,750 --> 01:13:28,250
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-da-da-dum.

1872
01:13:28,290 --> 01:13:29,910
Ba-ba-dum.

1873
01:13:29,910 --> 01:13:31,810
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-dum.

1874
01:13:31,870 --> 01:13:32,770
Ba-dum.

1875
01:13:33,270 --> 01:13:34,990
I told you, it's so good.

1876
01:13:36,490 --> 01:13:37,850
They'll never have this.

1877
01:13:37,930 --> 01:13:39,430
They can't take this away from us.

1878
01:13:39,490 --> 01:13:40,450
Anyway, back to...

1879
01:13:43,230 --> 01:13:45,010
They can't take this away.

1880
01:13:45,070 --> 01:13:47,130
They can make fun of us all they want.

1881
01:13:47,330 --> 01:13:50,410
But to us, those were bangers.

1882
01:13:55,510 --> 01:13:58,090
It was bangers.

1883
01:13:58,910 --> 01:14:00,950
To us, it was bangers.

1884
01:14:03,750 --> 01:14:08,730
They can't make fun of us, but we know this is what true music was like.

1885
01:14:10,530 --> 01:14:12,290
Wmercy, thank you for the super chat.

1886
01:14:12,390 --> 01:14:13,330
Thank you, thank you.

1887
01:14:13,350 --> 01:14:19,230
Instead of a version I didn't have but can instantly recognize, we had this version I grew up with but don't remember.

1888
01:14:20,110 --> 01:14:22,250
Thank you for the super chat, Wmercy.

1889
01:14:22,410 --> 01:14:23,730
Thank you, thank you.

1890
01:14:24,670 --> 01:14:26,930
Guys, I recognize it.

1891
01:14:27,110 --> 01:14:28,750
It just took...

1892
01:14:28,750 --> 01:14:31,850
Do you remember the Japanese Kirby opening?

1893
01:14:32,490 --> 01:14:33,650
I thought so.

1894
01:14:39,630 --> 01:14:40,530
That's right.

1895
01:14:41,010 --> 01:14:42,670
I thought so.

1896
01:14:48,330 --> 01:14:50,870
Kirby, Kirby, Kirby, but...

1897
01:14:51,530 --> 01:14:53,330
Kirby, Kirby, Kirby, but...

1898
01:14:53,330 --> 01:14:55,630
To be fair, it was mostly just him saying Kirby.

1899
01:14:55,890 --> 01:14:57,350
So it was very easy...

1900
01:14:59,650 --> 01:15:03,850
To be fair, it was very easy to remember because all he said was Kirby.

1901
01:15:04,850 --> 01:15:06,470
So that's why...

1902
01:15:06,470 --> 01:15:08,990
That's why I could remember it really well.

1903
01:15:10,350 --> 01:15:11,150
Alright, anyway.

1904
01:15:11,990 --> 01:15:13,010
Level 1 nod.

1905
01:15:13,070 --> 01:15:14,590
I really love the chat.

1906
01:15:14,690 --> 01:15:16,590
Sorry, back to our regular scheduled...

1907
01:15:17,670 --> 01:15:18,630
Art contest.

1908
01:15:19,170 --> 01:15:20,010
Back to...

1909
01:15:20,010 --> 01:15:22,790
Back to our regular scheduled...

1910
01:15:22,790 --> 01:15:24,010
Art contest.

1911
01:15:25,450 --> 01:15:27,670
I mean, the Sonic one is just gotta go fast.

1912
01:15:27,810 --> 01:15:29,490
Yeah, but that's why it's stuck in your head.

1913
01:15:29,790 --> 01:15:30,670
Gotta go fast.

1914
01:15:31,230 --> 01:15:32,230
Gotta go fast.

1915
01:15:32,570 --> 01:15:34,870
Gotta go faster, faster, f-f-f-faster.

1916
01:15:35,070 --> 01:15:36,310
Ba-ba-ba-da.

1917
01:15:36,470 --> 01:15:38,830
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-da-ba.

1918
01:15:39,010 --> 01:15:40,690
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.

1919
01:15:40,810 --> 01:15:41,510
All right.

1920
01:15:42,690 --> 01:15:43,970
Anyway, Level 1 nod.

1921
01:15:44,170 --> 01:15:47,270
I love the extra shading on the trophy there.

1922
01:15:47,410 --> 01:15:48,230
Because it gives like...

1923
01:15:48,230 --> 01:15:49,010
It makes it like so...

1924
01:15:49,010 --> 01:15:50,670
The trophy looks so 3D.

1925
01:15:50,730 --> 01:15:51,410
Not gonna lie.

1926
01:15:51,670 --> 01:15:52,650
I really love it.

1927
01:15:52,670 --> 01:15:53,230
And then like...

1928
01:15:53,230 --> 01:15:53,870
Uh...

1929
01:15:53,870 --> 01:15:58,650
The way the composition is, like, uh, the placements of everything is really nicely done.

1930
01:16:00,390 --> 01:16:02,290
We will never escape.

1931
01:16:02,630 --> 01:16:03,850
Whose fault is it?

1932
01:16:03,950 --> 01:16:05,430
Who started this compo-...

1933
01:16:05,430 --> 01:16:06,170
It wasn't me.

1934
01:16:06,510 --> 01:16:08,750
I didn't start this conversation.

1935
01:16:09,250 --> 01:16:11,290
I take zero blame in this.

1936
01:16:11,370 --> 01:16:13,290
I just got dragged in.

1937
01:16:13,470 --> 01:16:15,930
I got dragged in into this.

1938
01:16:16,450 --> 01:16:18,390
This is by LxNal.

1939
01:16:18,670 --> 01:16:19,310
Oh no, no.

1940
01:16:19,430 --> 01:16:21,030
Can you guys give me... Oh my god!

1941
01:16:21,030 --> 01:16:25,910
I didn't realize the little details with like the characters on the red pocket envelopes too.

1942
01:16:26,050 --> 01:16:29,810
Like all the dragoons here and then the tomato and then the long goons too.

1943
01:16:30,230 --> 01:16:33,030
Oh and the details on the dragon as well.

1944
01:16:33,190 --> 01:16:34,350
And the detail...

1945
01:16:36,110 --> 01:16:39,470
The very accurate representation of me.

1946
01:16:43,890 --> 01:16:45,370
It's in the details, guys.

1947
01:16:45,670 --> 01:16:47,590
It's the details, guys.

1948
01:16:50,930 --> 01:16:55,270
Anyway, I really like all the little details they added in general because it's just...

1949
01:16:55,860 --> 01:17:00,390
You can tell like lots of effort was put in the line art and everything.

1950
01:17:00,550 --> 01:17:02,170
Just the little tiny things there.

1951
01:17:02,550 --> 01:17:03,490
Very authentic.

1952
01:17:05,430 --> 01:17:07,870
Like I'veolve selection is dedicated and endorsed by Doki bird.

1953
01:17:08,830 --> 01:17:16,370
This one's by Madeley The thing I really liked about this is the background.

1954
01:17:16,710 --> 01:17:19,710
The background is... you look at the background.

1955
01:17:19,830 --> 01:17:28,710
They're like tiny dragoons everywhere, and they're all like... the fact that the entire background is just...

1956
01:17:28,710 --> 01:17:30,630
Tiny dragoons!

1957
01:17:30,690 --> 01:17:31,410
Like the little...

1958
01:17:31,410 --> 01:17:38,950
The effort put into that, the patterning and everything, and then the fact that, like, I think, like, the color-wise is, like, very well balanced, too.

1959
01:17:38,970 --> 01:17:41,550
Like, I, like, the red really fits the tomato.

1960
01:17:45,090 --> 01:17:49,810
Yeah, um, yeah, so, like, these are all the dragoon souls I've consumed.

1961
01:17:49,890 --> 01:17:55,070
Every time you join your membership, your... every time you join the membership, um, your soul is mine.

1962
01:17:55,130 --> 01:18:01,070
So, these are all the member goons here, um, who, like, who have absorbed their soul inside me.

1963
01:18:01,410 --> 01:18:05,950
And I've trapped them into this liminal... this black hole.

1964
01:18:07,630 --> 01:18:09,910
Every soul I consume, I get stronger.

1965
01:18:11,610 --> 01:18:12,670
Oh, look, it's me!

1966
01:18:12,710 --> 01:18:13,690
Yeah, you see yourself?

1967
01:18:14,050 --> 01:18:14,990
I see you guys!

1968
01:18:16,830 --> 01:18:19,010
The boy goons are real.

1969
01:18:21,970 --> 01:18:23,050
You're here forever.

1970
01:18:24,170 --> 01:18:28,710
Um, this is by, uh, Mange... I don't know how to pronounce this.

1971
01:18:29,950 --> 01:18:30,910
Mange... Jew?

1972
01:18:31,770 --> 01:18:34,110
Um... the style is really beautiful.

1973
01:18:35,670 --> 01:18:36,070
Um...

1974
01:18:36,590 --> 01:18:42,290
And then there's... I love the small... you know, like, what is that Rick and Morty part where it was, like, little faces?

1975
01:18:42,710 --> 01:18:45,850
This is what the tomato reminds me of!

1976
01:18:46,090 --> 01:18:47,030
Awesome, Powerball!

1977
01:18:47,090 --> 01:18:48,990
Thank you for the 10 gift ships!

1978
01:18:49,330 --> 01:18:50,270
Thank you, thank you!

1979
01:18:50,450 --> 01:18:51,790
I love how... what is it?

1980
01:18:51,870 --> 01:18:52,250
Little bites?

1981
01:18:52,590 --> 01:18:53,110
You know?

1982
01:18:53,170 --> 01:18:54,570
And then, um...

1983
01:18:54,570 --> 01:18:56,410
And then the little bits, yeah!

1984
01:18:56,550 --> 01:18:58,590
This is what the face reminded me of.

1985
01:18:58,650 --> 01:19:01,090
Because it looks like I have a very tiny little...

1986
01:19:01,410 --> 01:19:03,030
A little bit's face.

1987
01:19:03,350 --> 01:19:04,590
A little bite's face.

1988
01:19:07,770 --> 01:19:11,030
But I really love this style in general.

1989
01:19:11,350 --> 01:19:16,150
And it's just the little shading colors too of the hair.

1990
01:19:16,270 --> 01:19:16,870
The hair!

1991
01:19:17,030 --> 01:19:18,930
The way the hair is drawn as well.

1992
01:19:19,410 --> 01:19:22,270
And then, throw their souls in!

1993
01:19:27,670 --> 01:19:29,130
Blinko, thank you for the super chat!

1994
01:19:29,230 --> 01:19:29,930
Thank you, thank you!

1995
01:19:29,930 --> 01:19:30,750
Hi Doki!

1996
01:19:30,890 --> 01:19:35,730
I saw a bunch of stans at NYC selling Doki Bird art when I went to the concert there.

1997
01:19:35,850 --> 01:19:36,950
I love your clips!

1998
01:19:37,190 --> 01:19:38,490
I'm so hyped to grab this!

1999
01:19:38,690 --> 01:19:39,710
GG Bunda!

2000
01:19:39,710 --> 01:19:40,430
The art is mine!

2001
01:19:40,530 --> 01:19:40,890
I know!

2002
01:19:41,050 --> 01:19:43,990
It's so... oh my god, it's so... it's really hard.

2003
01:19:44,090 --> 01:19:45,270
It was really difficult to pick.

2004
01:19:45,670 --> 01:19:51,150
But I'm super excited that it's finally... we got the hardest part done.

2005
01:19:51,410 --> 01:19:54,770
Like, we got the hardest part done, finally.

2006
01:19:57,330 --> 01:19:59,910
But yeah, the name of the gamer sub logo is the hat.

2007
01:19:59,910 --> 01:20:02,370
And I just love how the hair is drawn.

2008
01:20:02,550 --> 01:20:04,190
It's just so pretty.

2009
01:20:04,310 --> 01:20:07,590
Like, it's just really dynamic in general, the way the hair is drawn.

2010
01:20:08,630 --> 01:20:09,630
Alright, this one.

2011
01:20:09,910 --> 01:20:10,170
Whoa!

2012
01:20:11,450 --> 01:20:11,850
Whoa!

2013
01:20:12,310 --> 01:20:13,810
My eyes are up here.

2014
01:20:15,070 --> 01:20:17,390
This was by Mafuki, not safe for work.

2015
01:20:17,410 --> 01:20:20,390
Guys, it's not safe for work, so don't open their profile at work, guys.

2016
01:20:20,590 --> 01:20:23,030
Like, it literally tells you it's not safe for work.

2017
01:20:23,230 --> 01:20:24,110
This is safe for work.

2018
01:20:24,310 --> 01:20:25,450
This is just suggestive.

2019
01:20:29,510 --> 01:20:30,790
Thank you for the...

2020
01:20:30,790 --> 01:20:34,110
Thank you for throwing another soul into the ship, Yoko.

2021
01:20:34,290 --> 01:20:35,850
Thank you for the super chat.

2022
01:20:35,970 --> 01:20:37,150
Thank you, thank you.

2023
01:20:38,250 --> 01:20:44,830
Also, as a parasite, I have successfully attached myself to her.

2024
01:20:46,970 --> 01:20:47,910
Guys, it's alright.

2025
01:20:48,190 --> 01:20:50,230
Alright, but yeah, I love, like...

2026
01:20:50,590 --> 01:20:52,250
I just... the pose is nice.

2027
01:20:52,850 --> 01:20:53,790
What can I say?

2028
01:20:54,030 --> 01:20:54,750
The pose...

2029
01:20:54,750 --> 01:20:56,850
Okay, guys, I'm gonna skip a little bit because I...

2030
01:20:57,330 --> 01:20:58,990
Speaking of not safe for work...

2031
01:20:58,990 --> 01:21:00,130
Guys, I need you guys...

2032
01:21:00,130 --> 01:21:01,090
Are you guys...

2033
01:21:01,090 --> 01:21:03,610
Okay, guys, the next one I'm gonna show you, I'm skipping...

2034
01:21:03,610 --> 01:21:05,210
I'm not skipping, but I wanted to, like...

2035
01:21:05,210 --> 01:21:08,330
I really want to show this next one right now.

2036
01:21:08,550 --> 01:21:11,830
Because I figured, like, might as well, since we're talking about not safe for work.

2037
01:21:12,070 --> 01:21:15,010
So, if you're at work, just be advised...

2038
01:21:15,010 --> 01:21:15,910
Just be advised.

2039
01:21:18,010 --> 01:21:18,450
Just...

2040
01:21:21,210 --> 01:21:21,650
Anyway...

2041
01:21:23,990 --> 01:21:26,630
Sorry, I forgot their...

2042
01:21:26,630 --> 01:21:26,950
Their...

2043
01:21:26,950 --> 01:21:27,430
Their...

2044
01:21:27,430 --> 01:21:30,050
Their actual Twitter name is Linebreaker.

2045
01:21:30,530 --> 01:21:32,190
But it's not safe for work, by the way.

2046
01:21:32,230 --> 01:21:33,350
I just forgot to put that here.

2047
01:21:33,470 --> 01:21:35,790
Their actual Twitter is Line...

2048
01:21:35,790 --> 01:21:36,970
Oh, it's Virtual Graves.

2049
01:21:37,090 --> 01:21:38,490
By the way, this is Virtual Graves.

2050
01:21:38,530 --> 01:21:39,370
You might recognize them.

2051
01:21:45,020 --> 01:21:45,980
You might...

2052
01:21:45,980 --> 01:21:49,000
I like how the tomato has a bikini.

2053
01:21:50,780 --> 01:21:53,000
You guys don't know who Virtual Graves is.

2054
01:21:53,660 --> 01:21:56,120
They've done a lot in the VTuber community.

2055
01:22:02,100 --> 01:22:03,560
So, there's this one, too.

2056
01:22:05,480 --> 01:22:10,000
Since we're talking about not safe for work, I might as well just show these right off the bat.

2057
01:22:11,320 --> 01:22:13,180
And this one is by...

2058
01:22:13,180 --> 01:22:17,260
I can feel its gravitational pull.

2059
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:20,320
They have their own gravity.

2060
01:22:25,360 --> 01:22:26,780
Thank you for the super chat.

2061
01:22:26,900 --> 01:22:27,180
Thank you.

2062
01:22:27,180 --> 01:22:27,680
Thank you.

2063
01:22:27,680 --> 01:22:29,300
Thank you for the super chat.

2064
01:22:29,400 --> 01:22:29,660
Thank you.

2065
01:22:29,680 --> 01:22:30,140
Thank you.

2066
01:22:30,140 --> 01:22:31,520
We got easy win.

2067
01:22:31,700 --> 01:22:34,740
Anyway, this is my Titan Gold.

2068
01:22:35,460 --> 01:22:36,040
And...

2069
01:22:37,300 --> 01:22:37,880
Yeah.

2070
01:22:38,280 --> 01:22:39,320
I like that.

2071
01:22:39,400 --> 01:22:40,920
I like the hard thing.

2072
01:22:41,020 --> 01:22:41,680
Like, whoa.

2073
01:22:41,880 --> 01:22:46,380
I'm just really happy about gamer subs.

2074
01:22:49,900 --> 01:22:52,820
I just love gamer subs so much.

2075
01:22:52,960 --> 01:22:53,780
Oh, my God.

2076
01:22:53,900 --> 01:22:54,800
Gamer subs.

2077
01:22:55,880 --> 01:22:56,460
Wow.

2078
01:22:56,460 --> 01:23:00,740
Did someone just use my gamer sub code, DokiBird?

2079
01:23:01,180 --> 01:23:02,520
By the way, guys.

2080
01:23:02,680 --> 01:23:04,220
I forgot to show about it.

2081
01:23:04,300 --> 01:23:11,100
But if you use my code, DokiBird, at gamer subs, you get 10% off on all earnings.

2082
01:23:13,300 --> 01:23:13,660
Whoa.

2083
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,560
I love gamer subs.

2084
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:19,680
Wow.

2085
01:23:20,360 --> 01:23:21,500
Gamer subs.

2086
01:23:23,240 --> 01:23:23,960
Okay.

2087
01:23:24,220 --> 01:23:24,680
Okay.

2088
01:23:24,680 --> 01:23:26,620
Back to the other entries.

2089
01:23:27,640 --> 01:23:30,980
I think these are the two not-safe-for-work entries.

2090
01:23:31,380 --> 01:23:31,840
Anyway.

2091
01:23:34,600 --> 01:23:35,640
We have...

2092
01:23:35,640 --> 01:23:35,860
Wait.

2093
01:23:36,020 --> 01:23:36,840
Can I have...

2094
01:23:36,840 --> 01:23:37,860
My mom made a code.

2095
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:38,140
Okay.

2096
01:23:38,200 --> 01:23:38,920
I'm going to pin your message.

2097
01:23:39,100 --> 01:23:40,740
I should have had that pinned at the very beginning.

2098
01:23:40,820 --> 01:23:41,260
I'm sorry.

2099
01:23:41,460 --> 01:23:44,900
I forgot to have that pinned at the very beginning.

2100
01:23:45,320 --> 01:23:45,840
Anyway.

2101
01:23:46,060 --> 01:23:47,740
Here's another one by...

2102
01:23:47,740 --> 01:23:49,680
Here's another one by Matt.

2103
01:23:51,780 --> 01:23:52,300
Desenhero.

2104
01:23:53,360 --> 01:23:54,660
And I like that.

2105
01:23:54,660 --> 01:23:56,600
I like how this looks like I'm driving a trophy.

2106
01:23:56,860 --> 01:23:58,780
Like, it feels like...

2107
01:24:00,160 --> 01:24:03,140
It just feels like I'm reading a comic book.

2108
01:24:03,240 --> 01:24:05,100
I really like the comic book panel.

2109
01:24:05,280 --> 01:24:06,820
And it looks like I'm driving a trophy.

2110
01:24:07,100 --> 01:24:08,500
I love the hair, too.

2111
01:24:08,560 --> 01:24:08,980
It's like...

2112
01:24:09,460 --> 01:24:13,020
It's such a stylistic way of drawing hair, as well.

2113
01:24:13,200 --> 01:24:14,120
And I'm like, whoa.

2114
01:24:15,420 --> 01:24:16,920
Yeah, it feels like a mecha.

2115
01:24:17,020 --> 01:24:17,440
Yeah.

2116
01:24:17,820 --> 01:24:20,060
You're just like, wow, we're going really fast.

2117
01:24:21,640 --> 01:24:22,120
Anyway.

2118
01:24:22,120 --> 01:24:25,060
Chonky Goons couldn't fit in the trophy, so you guys got left out.

2119
01:24:25,220 --> 01:24:26,900
You guys got left on the side of the road.

2120
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:27,300
I'm sorry.

2121
01:24:27,560 --> 01:24:28,460
There had to be one.

2122
01:24:28,680 --> 01:24:29,340
I'm sorry.

2123
01:24:29,500 --> 01:24:30,900
You guys picked the shortest straw.

2124
01:24:31,480 --> 01:24:31,960
Anyway.

2125
01:24:32,040 --> 01:24:36,820
Here's the next one by Megan Yulee.

2126
01:24:37,700 --> 01:24:38,660
I love...

2127
01:24:38,660 --> 01:24:44,880
Like, this style reminds me of, like, shoujo manga style, especially the eyes, too.

2128
01:24:45,620 --> 01:24:48,020
It reminded me heavily of shoujo manga.

2129
01:24:48,340 --> 01:24:49,120
You know what?

2130
01:24:49,220 --> 01:24:50,960
It reminds me of skip beat, I think.

2131
01:24:51,060 --> 01:24:52,020
Like, the way that...

2132
01:24:52,020 --> 01:24:55,400
I feel like I'm reading, like, the classic shoujo manga.

2133
01:24:56,280 --> 01:24:57,720
What was that publisher?

2134
01:24:57,880 --> 01:25:01,660
The publisher that makes, like...

2135
01:25:02,940 --> 01:25:03,920
Makes, like...

2136
01:25:05,140 --> 01:25:07,640
Like, who publishes specifically on...

2137
01:25:07,640 --> 01:25:10,900
By the way, do you guys know skip beat is still ongoing?

2138
01:25:11,480 --> 01:25:13,000
Like, I was so surprised.

2139
01:25:13,400 --> 01:25:15,040
I was like...

2140
01:25:15,040 --> 01:25:15,900
Oh, my...

2141
01:25:15,900 --> 01:25:18,680
Skip beat has been going on for a long time.

2142
01:25:20,500 --> 01:25:22,000
It's still ongoing.

2143
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:23,340
Yeah, clap.

2144
01:25:23,700 --> 01:25:24,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2145
01:25:24,920 --> 01:25:25,520
Like...

2146
01:25:25,520 --> 01:25:25,960
Yeah!

2147
01:25:27,240 --> 01:25:31,560
My Hero Academia ended, but skip beat is still going strong.

2148
01:25:33,520 --> 01:25:34,780
Yeah, it is!

2149
01:25:34,920 --> 01:25:37,280
I was literally looking up on it recently.

2150
01:25:38,640 --> 01:25:43,800
It's basically, like, an OG classic shoujo manga.

2151
01:25:44,760 --> 01:25:50,000
It's just about, like, this girl who, like, basically becomes an actress to get revenge...

2152
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:56,560
Like, get revenge on her ex-boyfriend because her ex-boyfriend used her to become an actor.

2153
01:25:56,780 --> 01:25:58,540
So, like, she was, like, his personal maid.

2154
01:25:58,720 --> 01:26:05,880
And then, like, she was so heartbroken that she was like, I'm gonna become an actress and I'm gonna be better than you at acting.

2155
01:26:06,180 --> 01:26:08,200
I don't even know what her goals are anymore.

2156
01:26:08,400 --> 01:26:11,180
Like, I don't even...

2157
01:26:11,180 --> 01:26:14,640
Yeah, like, I was like, it's still ongoing.

2158
01:26:14,820 --> 01:26:17,000
Is she not a better actress yet?

2159
01:26:17,060 --> 01:26:18,800
Did she not win an Oscar yet?

2160
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:21,800
I don't know what's going on anymore.

2161
01:26:21,900 --> 01:26:24,480
I don't know what's going on in skip beat.

2162
01:26:24,580 --> 01:26:25,600
But I'm just like...

2163
01:26:25,600 --> 01:26:26,700
I'm just like...

2164
01:26:26,700 --> 01:26:27,940
Did she do it?

2165
01:26:27,960 --> 01:26:28,520
Did she not?

2166
01:26:28,860 --> 01:26:30,300
Like, it's been 10 years.

2167
01:26:30,520 --> 01:26:33,400
Like, it's been 22 years.

2168
01:26:33,840 --> 01:26:36,460
Like, is she still acting?

2169
01:26:36,840 --> 01:26:37,860
Like, is she not...

2170
01:26:37,860 --> 01:26:39,640
Did she not win awards yet?

2171
01:26:43,560 --> 01:26:45,040
Damn you, Toki.

2172
01:26:45,140 --> 01:26:46,340
I wanna know now.

2173
01:26:48,800 --> 01:26:51,440
Skip beat and cliff notes, please.

2174
01:26:53,280 --> 01:26:55,060
Yeah, so like, I don't know.

2175
01:26:55,140 --> 01:26:56,220
I don't know if she...

2176
01:26:56,220 --> 01:27:00,140
Clearly she hasn't become a better act...

2177
01:27:00,140 --> 01:27:00,780
I don't know.

2178
01:27:00,820 --> 01:27:03,380
She clearly hasn't been a better actress yet.

2179
01:27:03,460 --> 01:27:03,940
Cause she's...

2180
01:27:03,940 --> 01:27:06,420
The manga is still going on.

2181
01:27:06,660 --> 01:27:11,040
So like, I assume that like, she's still competing against her ex.

2182
01:27:11,300 --> 01:27:12,180
I assume...

2183
01:27:13,520 --> 01:27:16,020
The skip beat is real.

2184
01:27:16,340 --> 01:27:16,560
So...

2185
01:27:18,260 --> 01:27:18,740
Anyway.

2186
01:27:19,720 --> 01:27:23,300
We have this one by Maya VT.

2187
01:27:24,700 --> 01:27:27,340
Guys, I think one of my favorite things too...

2188
01:27:27,340 --> 01:27:29,600
About looking at all the different art styles...

2189
01:27:29,600 --> 01:27:31,280
Is the way people draw eyes.

2190
01:27:31,640 --> 01:27:32,540
I think like...

2191
01:27:32,540 --> 01:27:34,040
Like, each artist...

2192
01:27:34,040 --> 01:27:34,700
Oh, and especially...

2193
01:27:34,700 --> 01:27:35,080
Oh my gosh.

2194
01:27:35,100 --> 01:27:36,900
Like, the details on the clothes too.

2195
01:27:37,020 --> 01:27:38,840
Like, the clothing flip fold and everything.

2196
01:27:39,040 --> 01:27:39,960
And the shading here.

2197
01:27:40,180 --> 01:27:42,080
To accentuate certain aspects.

2198
01:27:42,220 --> 01:27:43,740
That is 100% true, by the way.

2199
01:27:48,620 --> 01:27:49,540
Yeah, this one...

2200
01:27:49,540 --> 01:27:50,160
I love the...

2201
01:27:50,160 --> 01:27:51,940
The way that eyes are drawn.

2202
01:27:52,120 --> 01:27:53,200
And like, good shading.

2203
01:27:53,380 --> 01:27:54,700
I love this part of the shading.

2204
01:27:54,900 --> 01:27:55,820
Like, good job.

2205
01:27:56,060 --> 01:27:57,940
And then their GamerSub logo on the ruffles too.

2206
01:27:58,220 --> 01:28:00,580
The GamerSub logo on the ruffles.

2207
01:28:00,740 --> 01:28:01,840
Oh, that's very creative!

2208
01:28:01,840 --> 01:28:03,000
Now that I think about it.

2209
01:28:03,080 --> 01:28:03,420
That's...

2210
01:28:03,420 --> 01:28:04,600
That's really creative.

2211
01:28:04,900 --> 01:28:05,160
Anyway.

2212
01:28:05,500 --> 01:28:07,180
This part is...

2213
01:28:08,340 --> 01:28:08,820
The...

2214
01:28:08,820 --> 01:28:10,160
The chef's kiss.

2215
01:28:10,260 --> 01:28:10,560
Mwah.

2216
01:28:14,460 --> 01:28:15,200
That's the...

2217
01:28:15,200 --> 01:28:16,320
That's the chef's kiss.

2218
01:28:16,320 --> 01:28:17,200
That's the chef's kiss right here.

2219
01:28:22,020 --> 01:28:23,840
Here we have...

2220
01:28:25,980 --> 01:28:27,100
From MewChub.

2221
01:28:28,540 --> 01:28:30,140
Oh, it's so like...

2222
01:28:30,140 --> 01:28:31,560
I look so innocent here.

2223
01:28:31,860 --> 01:28:33,560
Which is also very accurate too.

2224
01:28:34,900 --> 01:28:39,000
And then I like how the GamerSub logo is the pin on my shirt.

2225
01:28:39,060 --> 01:28:41,280
It's like the pin or button on my shirt.

2226
01:28:41,520 --> 01:28:42,680
And there's also me.

2227
01:28:42,800 --> 01:28:45,920
This is before the parasite attached to her.

2228
01:28:46,980 --> 01:28:48,560
Yeah, it looks like an anime style.

2229
01:28:48,880 --> 01:28:49,060
Yeah.

2230
01:28:49,200 --> 01:28:50,580
It looks like from an anime.

2231
01:28:50,800 --> 01:28:53,060
And it reminds me of a particular anime style.

2232
01:28:53,580 --> 01:28:54,660
Oh, what is it?

2233
01:28:54,700 --> 01:28:55,740
Is it Fullmetal Alchemist?

2234
01:28:56,140 --> 01:28:57,040
Like there's something...

2235
01:28:57,040 --> 01:29:01,520
I think it sort of reminds me of Fullmetal Alchemist style a little bit too.

2236
01:29:02,180 --> 01:29:04,240
So like this is like RetroDoki.

2237
01:29:04,600 --> 01:29:07,520
Before the parasite infected her.

2238
01:29:08,540 --> 01:29:09,500
Or K-On!

2239
01:29:09,540 --> 01:29:09,740
Yeah!

2240
01:29:09,860 --> 01:29:10,520
K-On!

2241
01:29:10,940 --> 01:29:11,880
K-On too!

2242
01:29:14,380 --> 01:29:15,900
Yeah, I can see the K-On.

2243
01:29:15,920 --> 01:29:16,240
Oh my.

2244
01:29:16,320 --> 01:29:16,440
Oh my god.

2245
01:29:17,080 --> 01:29:18,680
Do people even remember K-On?

2246
01:29:19,340 --> 01:29:21,520
I never watched K-On.

2247
01:29:21,940 --> 01:29:22,500
But...

2248
01:29:23,180 --> 01:29:23,740
But...

2249
01:29:25,280 --> 01:29:27,800
I really liked their figures.

2250
01:29:28,060 --> 01:29:30,040
Because back then...

2251
01:29:30,040 --> 01:29:31,820
K-On was everywhere.

2252
01:29:32,280 --> 01:29:32,680
Like...

2253
01:29:32,680 --> 01:29:33,560
Figure wise.

2254
01:29:33,680 --> 01:29:34,700
Like there was so many...

2255
01:29:34,700 --> 01:29:37,920
So much merchandise of K-On stuff.

2256
01:29:38,260 --> 01:29:39,840
And I never watched K-On.

2257
01:29:39,900 --> 01:29:41,300
But I really liked the merch.

2258
01:29:41,560 --> 01:29:42,860
So I bought like...

2259
01:29:42,860 --> 01:29:45,340
You know how like each girl has their own figure?

2260
01:29:45,340 --> 01:29:46,140
And everything.

2261
01:29:46,300 --> 01:29:49,060
And you're supposed to collect all the girls to make like the band?

2262
01:29:49,720 --> 01:29:50,200
Um...

2263
01:29:50,200 --> 01:29:51,860
I just bought one of them.

2264
01:29:52,020 --> 01:29:53,720
Because I just thought she was the cutest.

2265
01:29:54,080 --> 01:29:56,060
So I bought the one on the piano.

2266
01:29:56,320 --> 01:29:57,500
With the bushy eyebrows.

2267
01:29:58,320 --> 01:29:59,460
That's the only one I bought.

2268
01:30:02,220 --> 01:30:03,840
I was like...

2269
01:30:03,840 --> 01:30:05,140
You will be alone forever.

2270
01:30:05,360 --> 01:30:07,080
I will not buy any other girl.

2271
01:30:07,260 --> 01:30:08,260
You will be...

2272
01:30:10,280 --> 01:30:11,220
I just...

2273
01:30:11,220 --> 01:30:12,800
I literally just bought her.

2274
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:14,040
With the piano.

2275
01:30:14,040 --> 01:30:15,100
And then...

2276
01:30:15,100 --> 01:30:17,520
And then I was just like...

2277
01:30:17,520 --> 01:30:18,600
That is it.

2278
01:30:20,020 --> 01:30:20,520
You...

2279
01:30:21,240 --> 01:30:22,900
You will have no one else.

2280
01:30:26,620 --> 01:30:28,260
I don't even know who she is.

2281
01:30:28,400 --> 01:30:32,100
I just thought she was the cutest figure out there.

2282
01:30:32,320 --> 01:30:32,900
Like you know...

2283
01:30:32,900 --> 01:30:34,320
Because you're supposed to have all of them.

2284
01:30:34,400 --> 01:30:36,340
To make the full band.

2285
01:30:37,580 --> 01:30:39,800
You don't need anyone else.

2286
01:30:40,040 --> 01:30:40,840
That's true.

2287
01:30:41,180 --> 01:30:42,100
I literally...

2288
01:30:42,100 --> 01:30:43,900
When I had like a figure case.

2289
01:30:43,900 --> 01:30:44,800
I just...

2290
01:30:44,800 --> 01:30:45,500
She just...

2291
01:30:45,500 --> 01:30:48,420
I was like...

2292
01:30:48,420 --> 01:30:50,400
You're supposed to put her with the other girls.

2293
01:30:50,400 --> 01:30:51,380
To make the band.

2294
01:30:51,700 --> 01:30:52,100
And I'm just...

2295
01:30:52,100 --> 01:30:52,880
I just put her in it.

2296
01:30:53,140 --> 01:30:54,760
I just put her in it.

2297
01:30:56,480 --> 01:30:56,920
Alright.

2298
01:30:57,520 --> 01:30:57,960
Anyway.

2299
01:30:58,040 --> 01:31:00,780
This one is by MeKQX.

2300
01:31:01,780 --> 01:31:02,620
Oh my gosh.

2301
01:31:02,700 --> 01:31:03,420
I love like...

2302
01:31:03,420 --> 01:31:04,500
The pose is really nice.

2303
01:31:04,560 --> 01:31:05,780
It's so dynamic too.

2304
01:31:06,020 --> 01:31:06,460
Like...

2305
01:31:06,460 --> 01:31:07,240
Especially the hand.

2306
01:31:07,340 --> 01:31:08,760
The fact that the hand is like bigger.

2307
01:31:08,980 --> 01:31:09,820
So that it's like...

2308
01:31:09,820 --> 01:31:10,620
She's like...

2309
01:31:10,620 --> 01:31:11,060
It's like...

2310
01:31:11,060 --> 01:31:11,900
It's like the perspective.

2311
01:31:11,900 --> 01:31:12,780
Yeah, that's the word.

2312
01:31:12,840 --> 01:31:15,280
The perspective is really nice here too.

2313
01:31:15,860 --> 01:31:17,680
And like the shading as well.

2314
01:31:17,740 --> 01:31:19,760
This is a different type of shading than you see usually.

2315
01:31:20,040 --> 01:31:21,520
It's a lot more like...

2316
01:31:21,520 --> 01:31:22,980
Pop out, I guess.

2317
01:31:23,060 --> 01:31:23,720
That's the word.

2318
01:31:23,820 --> 01:31:26,080
Definitely pops out a little bit...

2319
01:31:26,900 --> 01:31:28,900
More regarding the shading here.

2320
01:31:29,240 --> 01:31:30,040
It's different.

2321
01:31:30,180 --> 01:31:31,460
It's definitely different from...

2322
01:31:31,460 --> 01:31:33,780
The other art pieces in terms of it.

2323
01:31:35,400 --> 01:31:38,240
And we have Momo Iru.

2324
01:31:38,800 --> 01:31:40,320
Oh, that's so adorable.

2325
01:31:40,320 --> 01:31:41,380
It's so...

2326
01:31:42,420 --> 01:31:43,520
It's so adorable!

2327
01:31:43,720 --> 01:31:44,920
And then we have the tomato down here.

2328
01:31:44,960 --> 01:31:45,320
She's like...

2329
01:31:46,200 --> 01:31:48,700
She doesn't know what's gonna happen!

2330
01:31:49,620 --> 01:31:51,200
She's in my life!

2331
01:31:52,440 --> 01:31:53,920
Your life is mine!

2332
01:31:57,220 --> 01:31:58,980
This is the little guy.

2333
01:32:00,760 --> 01:32:02,860
A gremlin tomato...

2334
01:32:02,860 --> 01:32:05,200
A dubious little creature.

2335
01:32:07,220 --> 01:32:08,560
And he went...

2336
01:32:09,680 --> 01:32:10,300
I'm glad he didn't hurt myself.

2337
01:32:10,300 --> 01:32:14,780
But I like... I really... Oh, and then like the gamer stuff's here and then the gamer stuff's here.

2338
01:32:14,860 --> 01:32:18,180
So you see like both the gamer stuff logos on either side.

2339
01:32:18,280 --> 01:32:19,660
It's just really cute in general.

2340
01:32:19,760 --> 01:32:23,580
It's like a very simple and cute art for the waifu cup.

2341
01:32:24,500 --> 01:32:27,300
And then we have Moon D.Y.

2342
01:32:27,400 --> 01:32:27,760
art.

2343
01:32:27,880 --> 01:32:29,780
Oh my gosh, the details.

2344
01:32:31,700 --> 01:32:35,240
Sorry, whenever I see myself, I just can't help but...

2345
01:32:36,460 --> 01:32:36,940
just...

2346
01:32:38,280 --> 01:32:39,820
I can't help it.

2347
01:32:40,940 --> 01:32:47,660
I do like the details in this one and I just feel the aura, you know?

2348
01:32:47,720 --> 01:32:52,260
I just I can't help but laugh because I feel the aura coming off of the tomato.

2349
01:32:54,740 --> 01:32:59,160
Yeah, the inner gremlin just comes out the moment I see it.

2350
01:32:59,320 --> 01:33:01,080
It just comes out.

2351
01:33:03,520 --> 01:33:06,360
And Zonnerman, thank you for the super chat.

2352
01:33:06,420 --> 01:33:06,700
Thank you.

2353
01:33:06,700 --> 01:33:07,080
Thank you.

2354
01:33:07,080 --> 01:33:10,000
When you look up the account and you're already following, which one?

2355
01:33:12,220 --> 01:33:12,740
Which...

2356
01:33:12,740 --> 01:33:14,420
All of them?

2357
01:33:14,620 --> 01:33:18,640
All the... not the, the very suggestive ones?

2358
01:33:18,980 --> 01:33:20,200
Like Limebreaker?

2359
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:23,740
Thank you for the super chat.

2360
01:33:23,860 --> 01:33:24,140
Thank you.

2361
01:33:24,160 --> 01:33:27,380
Thank you, but I love the details and then the little blush here too.

2362
01:33:27,620 --> 01:33:36,140
The little blush here for the artwork and all the details on the clothing flow too and the shading here, that's always a plus.

2363
01:33:36,260 --> 01:33:39,000
Whenever I see shading right here, I'm like good job.

2364
01:33:39,040 --> 01:33:40,060
You already mastered.

2365
01:33:44,760 --> 01:33:47,300
But yes, the shading is really nice and well done.

2366
01:33:47,480 --> 01:33:49,980
And then the little details on the line work and everything.

2367
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:56,480
And then we have... PKT Metal Gear Solid.

2368
01:33:58,300 --> 01:34:00,440
Sorry, PKT MGS.

2369
01:34:01,080 --> 01:34:04,380
Every time I see MGS, I just think Metal Gear Solid as well.

2370
01:34:04,600 --> 01:34:07,660
I love how the gamer sub logo is on the tomato itself.

2371
01:34:08,140 --> 01:34:09,300
Oh, it's on my ass!

2372
01:34:09,300 --> 01:34:10,720
You see the eyes?

2373
01:34:14,240 --> 01:34:21,480
I love the... I love that the gamer sub logo is on my ass here.

2374
01:34:21,580 --> 01:34:22,940
You see the eyes here?

2375
01:34:23,080 --> 01:34:24,320
And then I'm like, oops.

2376
01:34:24,700 --> 01:34:25,460
I'm like, oops.

2377
01:34:25,680 --> 01:34:28,500
And then the gamer sub logo is on my ass.

2378
01:34:28,820 --> 01:34:32,080
And all the dragoons being like, yay!

2379
01:34:32,720 --> 01:34:33,240
Donkey!

2380
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:35,520
Donkey!

2381
01:34:35,680 --> 01:34:37,220
I love the face.

2382
01:34:37,400 --> 01:34:38,820
I just love this part the most.

2383
01:34:40,080 --> 01:34:42,480
Get yourself a gamer sub tramp stamp.

2384
01:34:45,500 --> 01:34:50,200
Get yourself a gamer sub tramp stamp, guys.

2385
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:52,840
And you guys are like, yippee!

2386
01:34:54,180 --> 01:34:55,060
Donkey's here!

2387
01:34:58,820 --> 01:35:01,480
And then we have probably Melody.

2388
01:35:01,740 --> 01:35:02,400
And then...

2389
01:35:03,940 --> 01:35:05,940
There's the little tomato.

2390
01:35:06,140 --> 01:35:08,260
Little me getting stomped on.

2391
01:35:08,260 --> 01:35:12,980
And then you're an accomplice to murder plus thief.

2392
01:35:13,240 --> 01:35:14,000
Or murder.

2393
01:35:14,040 --> 01:35:14,620
It could be murder.

2394
01:35:14,740 --> 01:35:16,860
This could be like a piece of a body part.

2395
01:35:17,160 --> 01:35:22,160
And I was like, dragoon, we gotta grab this so we can destroy the evidence.

2396
01:35:22,760 --> 01:35:24,300
I mean, it could be murder.

2397
01:35:24,440 --> 01:35:25,460
It could be money.

2398
01:35:25,900 --> 01:35:26,920
It could be anything.

2399
01:35:27,100 --> 01:35:28,300
We don't know what's in the bag.

2400
01:35:30,180 --> 01:35:33,980
But I love how, like, I'm coming out of the rectangular box.

2401
01:35:34,280 --> 01:35:36,020
Because I was like, you'll never catch me alive.

2402
01:35:36,020 --> 01:35:39,260
I will let this dragoon die before I get caught.

2403
01:35:40,460 --> 01:35:43,720
But yeah, so I love how... yeah, the hands on the frame, too.

2404
01:35:44,380 --> 01:35:47,960
It's really creative in the way they do it.

2405
01:35:48,040 --> 01:35:48,780
Yeah, the heist.

2406
01:35:48,940 --> 01:35:50,680
The heist or murder of the century.

2407
01:35:52,220 --> 01:35:53,020
Alright, guys.

2408
01:35:54,620 --> 01:35:55,380
Eighty-one!

2409
01:35:56,240 --> 01:35:59,340
Oh my god, this looks like it's from an anime opening.

2410
01:35:59,840 --> 01:36:03,080
Oh my gosh, the background, too.

2411
01:36:03,320 --> 01:36:04,420
Imagine the liquid.

2412
01:36:08,020 --> 01:36:12,500
You can see, like, bits of the print coming out of the...

2413
01:36:13,020 --> 01:36:16,780
Like, you can see the bits of the print from the cup as well.

2414
01:36:16,840 --> 01:36:17,320
This is really cute.

2415
01:36:17,660 --> 01:36:20,280
This is by Purisyunblue8.

2416
01:36:22,040 --> 01:36:27,640
And I really love... I just think it reminds me of, like, an anime opening in general.

2417
01:36:27,980 --> 01:36:29,100
Yeah, it really does.

2418
01:36:29,240 --> 01:36:32,260
It looks like an enoki with a heart in the middle.

2419
01:36:32,300 --> 01:36:33,060
That's so cute.

2420
01:36:33,060 --> 01:36:36,380
The heart... the O turns into a heart.

2421
01:36:36,640 --> 01:36:37,940
And then, like, a checky!

2422
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:43,280
Yeah, yeah, it's like a checky that you get at, like, a maid cafe.

2423
01:36:43,720 --> 01:36:46,780
And then I'm like, that'll be $50?

2424
01:36:49,320 --> 01:36:50,720
Guys, you don't understand.

2425
01:36:50,960 --> 01:36:54,040
I went to a maid cafe in Japan, and they were so expensive.

2426
01:36:54,540 --> 01:36:56,360
They're like, you want a photo with me?

2427
01:36:56,780 --> 01:37:01,540
You need to pay, like... you have to pay the VIP package.

2428
01:37:01,540 --> 01:37:04,720
You have to pay the VIP package.

2429
01:37:04,960 --> 01:37:06,840
But they'll sing you a song, too.

2430
01:37:07,140 --> 01:37:07,980
They'll sing you a...

2431
01:37:07,980 --> 01:37:10,320
Well, it's cheaper because, um...

2432
01:37:10,320 --> 01:37:15,420
Because, like, the US dollars at the moment is, like...

2433
01:37:15,980 --> 01:37:18,940
I guess, like, against the yen, it'll be cheaper.

2434
01:37:19,060 --> 01:37:22,540
So, like, for us, it'll be, like, $20, I think.

2435
01:37:22,620 --> 01:37:25,000
I don't know how the conversion rate is.

2436
01:37:25,100 --> 01:37:26,900
I don't know if the yen rose.

2437
01:37:27,300 --> 01:37:29,660
I think the yen rose, right?

2438
01:37:29,840 --> 01:37:30,840
It rose up, right?

2439
01:37:30,840 --> 01:37:31,680
I don't know.

2440
01:37:31,720 --> 01:37:33,440
I didn't keep track because I'm not going to Japan.

2441
01:37:33,720 --> 01:37:34,080
So...

2442
01:37:35,500 --> 01:37:36,760
So, I'm not sure.

2443
01:37:37,020 --> 01:37:39,260
But, like, maybe it'll be, like, $30 instead.

2444
01:37:43,020 --> 01:37:44,400
We have this one.

2445
01:37:46,280 --> 01:37:47,880
Oh, it's back down again.

2446
01:37:48,080 --> 01:37:48,660
I'm sorry.

2447
01:37:49,580 --> 01:37:50,460
10,000?

2448
01:37:50,580 --> 01:37:51,460
Oh, my God.

2449
01:37:51,500 --> 01:37:52,320
That's $70?

2450
01:37:53,060 --> 01:37:56,320
I remember when 10,000 yen was, like, $100.

2451
01:37:56,380 --> 01:37:57,900
It was, like, almost one...

2452
01:37:57,900 --> 01:37:59,240
It was so easy to calculate.

2453
01:37:59,560 --> 01:38:00,820
And now it's, like, $70.

2454
01:38:00,820 --> 01:38:01,860
That's crazy.

2455
01:38:02,880 --> 01:38:03,840
That's actually...

2456
01:38:03,840 --> 01:38:04,080
Wow.

2457
01:38:04,680 --> 01:38:05,820
God damn it, America.

2458
01:38:09,940 --> 01:38:17,020
This is why, for contracts now, when they're, like, do you want to be paid in American dollars or Canadian dollars?

2459
01:38:17,400 --> 01:38:19,160
I just be, like, American.

2460
01:38:20,140 --> 01:38:23,260
Trina was, like, please do not pay me in Canadian dollars.

2461
01:38:23,440 --> 01:38:25,700
I have an American dollar account.

2462
01:38:25,900 --> 01:38:28,980
I would like to receive American money.

2463
01:38:29,400 --> 01:38:29,880
I...

2464
01:38:30,680 --> 01:38:32,020
Every time, they're, like, would...

2465
01:38:32,020 --> 01:38:33,580
They're, like, okay, how would you like to pay?

2466
01:38:33,640 --> 01:38:36,880
I was, like, why transfer to my American dollar account, please?

2467
01:38:40,600 --> 01:38:41,740
I'm just, like...

2468
01:38:41,740 --> 01:38:44,820
I'm, like, I will not receive Canadian money.

2469
01:38:45,600 --> 01:38:48,840
Don't pay me in my monopoly money, please.

2470
01:38:49,700 --> 01:38:51,580
Like, it's still falling.

2471
01:38:56,400 --> 01:38:57,200
Walter, ask...

2472
01:38:57,200 --> 01:38:58,880
You ask any other Canadian.

2473
01:38:58,880 --> 01:39:02,940
They would rather be paid in American dollars than Canadian dollars.

2474
01:39:03,020 --> 01:39:05,940
You don't understand how shitty our currency is right now.

2475
01:39:06,080 --> 01:39:07,240
I don't understand.

2476
01:39:07,860 --> 01:39:11,560
Anybody would rather be paid by American money right now.

2477
01:39:11,680 --> 01:39:12,500
Unless it's Euros.

2478
01:39:12,980 --> 01:39:15,960
It's, like, Euros than American money.

2479
01:39:16,140 --> 01:39:17,800
Because, like, Euros is even worth more.

2480
01:39:18,100 --> 01:39:18,660
Like...

2481
01:39:19,740 --> 01:39:20,980
Not by a lot.

2482
01:39:21,120 --> 01:39:23,440
But, like, it's still, like, a little better.

2483
01:39:24,500 --> 01:39:25,060
Yeah.

2484
01:39:25,760 --> 01:39:26,320
Yeah.

2485
01:39:26,320 --> 01:39:26,360
Yeah.

2486
01:39:29,300 --> 01:39:32,500
Anyway, this one is by R1 Salt.

2487
01:39:32,680 --> 01:39:37,860
I really love the personality of this particular piece.

2488
01:39:38,100 --> 01:39:39,280
And the fact that, like...

2489
01:39:39,280 --> 01:39:41,560
I just love the...

2490
01:39:42,580 --> 01:39:46,280
I just love the personality and the composition of it.

2491
01:39:46,440 --> 01:39:48,000
Like, I know it's, like, a little bit simpler.

2492
01:39:48,160 --> 01:39:49,760
But especially the background, too.

2493
01:39:49,900 --> 01:39:52,640
The background, as well, is, like...

2494
01:39:53,220 --> 01:39:54,540
Is, like, really well done.

2495
01:39:54,600 --> 01:39:56,340
Because it fits the theme of the album.

2496
01:39:56,340 --> 01:39:56,720
It fits the outfit.

2497
01:39:56,720 --> 01:39:59,960
And the expression and the personality, like...

2498
01:39:59,960 --> 01:40:00,780
It's just so good.

2499
01:40:00,900 --> 01:40:02,260
It's, like, I basically...

2500
01:40:02,260 --> 01:40:02,960
Um...

2501
01:40:02,960 --> 01:40:04,000
Like...

2502
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,360
Like, you lost the deal or something.

2503
01:40:06,620 --> 01:40:08,060
Yeah, it feels like I'm, like...

2504
01:40:08,060 --> 01:40:09,040
The head...

2505
01:40:09,040 --> 01:40:10,140
The head boss.

2506
01:40:10,240 --> 01:40:11,000
Or, like...

2507
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:11,800
The...

2508
01:40:12,700 --> 01:40:14,340
You know what this reminds me of?

2509
01:40:15,180 --> 01:40:15,700
Um...

2510
01:40:15,700 --> 01:40:17,220
This reminds me of...

2511
01:40:17,220 --> 01:40:20,140
The aunt from Kung Fu Hustle.

2512
01:40:21,120 --> 01:40:21,960
That's the...

2513
01:40:21,960 --> 01:40:23,160
I just need a cigarette.

2514
01:40:23,440 --> 01:40:23,920
Like...

2515
01:40:26,340 --> 01:40:26,600
Yeah.

2516
01:40:27,120 --> 01:40:27,600
That's...

2517
01:40:27,600 --> 01:40:28,700
I just need...

2518
01:40:28,700 --> 01:40:31,160
I just need the cigarette.

2519
01:40:31,440 --> 01:40:31,920
Right?

2520
01:40:32,080 --> 01:40:32,560
Yeah.

2521
01:40:32,600 --> 01:40:32,940
This is...

2522
01:40:32,940 --> 01:40:34,940
This is what it reminds me of.

2523
01:40:35,080 --> 01:40:35,560
Yeah.

2524
01:40:38,220 --> 01:40:39,660
And the hair curls.

2525
01:40:40,320 --> 01:40:40,800
Um...

2526
01:40:42,060 --> 01:40:42,960
The badass.

2527
01:40:43,060 --> 01:40:43,280
Yeah.

2528
01:40:43,440 --> 01:40:44,480
The landlady.

2529
01:40:44,580 --> 01:40:44,940
Yeah.

2530
01:40:44,940 --> 01:40:45,880
The landlady.

2531
01:40:46,340 --> 01:40:47,500
I love that lady.

2532
01:40:47,740 --> 01:40:47,960
Yeah.

2533
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:48,980
I love...

2534
01:40:48,980 --> 01:40:50,240
I love Kung Fu Hustle.

2535
01:40:50,580 --> 01:40:51,060
Uh...

2536
01:40:51,060 --> 01:40:53,660
She looks like she's about to sell me some Toki merch.

2537
01:40:53,740 --> 01:40:55,000
Cass, thank you for the super chat.

2538
01:40:55,100 --> 01:40:55,500
Thank you.

2539
01:40:55,500 --> 01:40:56,120
Thank you.

2540
01:40:57,340 --> 01:40:57,780
Um...

2541
01:40:57,780 --> 01:40:58,900
Here we have...

2542
01:40:58,900 --> 01:41:00,300
Rare Spice.

2543
01:41:00,540 --> 01:41:01,320
Oh my gosh.

2544
01:41:01,400 --> 01:41:02,800
I like how, um...

2545
01:41:02,800 --> 01:41:04,340
For this one, it's like...

2546
01:41:04,340 --> 01:41:06,600
I'm like confined in a space.

2547
01:41:06,820 --> 01:41:08,600
Cause a lot of them are shows like the body.

2548
01:41:08,780 --> 01:41:09,460
Like the full body.

2549
01:41:09,640 --> 01:41:10,460
Or like, uh...

2550
01:41:10,460 --> 01:41:11,360
The half...

2551
01:41:11,360 --> 01:41:11,980
Half body?

2552
01:41:12,240 --> 01:41:17,960
But this one is more so focused on like the composition and like playing with the limited space they have.

2553
01:41:18,380 --> 01:41:18,820
Um...

2554
01:41:18,820 --> 01:41:19,940
So, I really like the...

2555
01:41:19,940 --> 01:41:20,140
Yeah.

2556
01:41:20,160 --> 01:41:20,920
It's like squishy.

2557
01:41:21,180 --> 01:41:23,420
The composition of this one is really nice.

2558
01:41:23,460 --> 01:41:24,380
The fact that it's like...

2559
01:41:24,380 --> 01:41:25,220
Um...

2560
01:41:25,220 --> 01:41:25,480
The composition of this one is really nice.

2561
01:41:25,480 --> 01:41:26,820
It's like a character select.

2562
01:41:26,900 --> 01:41:28,400
That's what it reminds me of, yeah.

2563
01:41:29,400 --> 01:41:34,540
This reminds me of like a character select menu of like...

2564
01:41:35,450 --> 01:41:37,560
in like a fighting game.

2565
01:41:38,150 --> 01:41:38,720
Or something.

2566
01:41:39,100 --> 01:41:39,520
Yeah.

2567
01:41:40,100 --> 01:41:41,800
This one, Renkai.

2568
01:41:42,100 --> 01:41:42,840
So cute.

2569
01:41:43,240 --> 01:41:44,640
There's Seisou Doki again.

2570
01:41:44,840 --> 01:41:46,000
I noticed a pattern.

2571
01:41:46,160 --> 01:41:47,600
A lot of like my...

2572
01:41:48,260 --> 01:41:52,480
very like, especially like the cute artists, they choose Seisou Doki.

2573
01:41:52,980 --> 01:41:55,000
And it really fits too.

2574
01:41:55,480 --> 01:41:58,240
Like it's so cute with the hugging the plushie.

2575
01:41:58,260 --> 01:42:00,480
And then the plushie tag is the GamerSup logo.

2576
01:42:00,920 --> 01:42:03,820
And you're like, this is before the infection started.

2577
01:42:07,520 --> 01:42:11,500
This is before I latched on to it.

2578
01:42:16,720 --> 01:42:21,200
But yeah, I really love... I just love how the face is done too.

2579
01:42:21,260 --> 01:42:22,300
It's just so soft looking.

2580
01:42:23,660 --> 01:42:24,780
It's just really...

2581
01:42:24,780 --> 01:42:27,440
Before she became an FPS gamer.

2582
01:42:28,080 --> 01:42:29,700
This is what she was.

2583
01:42:31,520 --> 01:42:33,900
This is RicardoConArt.

2584
01:42:35,820 --> 01:42:36,380
So...

2585
01:42:36,380 --> 01:42:38,680
I really love...

2586
01:42:38,680 --> 01:42:41,780
I just... I don't know like the whole piece itself.

2587
01:42:42,420 --> 01:42:43,540
It's just...

2588
01:42:44,300 --> 01:42:46,320
It's just really like you don't know where to...

2589
01:42:46,320 --> 01:42:47,640
Like it's just really well done.

2590
01:42:47,740 --> 01:42:51,760
Like your eyes like go everywhere because you're like looking at the details and everything.

2591
01:42:52,180 --> 01:42:54,560
And yeah, the background is really well done.

2592
01:42:54,560 --> 01:42:55,520
The fact that there's shadows.

2593
01:42:55,620 --> 01:42:58,940
There's like implying there's more dragoons in the back here too.

2594
01:42:59,160 --> 01:43:02,300
And then the dragons at the bottom and they're popping up here as well.

2595
01:43:02,560 --> 01:43:08,000
And the the movement of the piece is like really dynamic too.

2596
01:43:08,480 --> 01:43:11,300
It's just like the whole piece as well.

2597
01:43:11,320 --> 01:43:13,880
It's just super interesting to look at.

2598
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:16,680
Yeah, guys, it was hard guys.

2599
01:43:16,760 --> 01:43:18,000
Now, you know why it was so hard.

2600
01:43:18,080 --> 01:43:20,800
I bet you guys have more than 20 of favorites right now.

2601
01:43:20,900 --> 01:43:23,500
And I at first had to pick one.

2602
01:43:23,500 --> 01:43:25,100
To be the waifu cup.

2603
01:43:25,220 --> 01:43:26,660
But then in the end I picked two.

2604
01:43:26,960 --> 01:43:31,840
I was like this is really difficult to pick one.

2605
01:43:40,310 --> 01:43:41,270
All right.

2606
01:43:41,990 --> 01:43:45,790
Here we have from Risa Twitch.

2607
01:43:46,070 --> 01:43:55,470
I love the background for this and like the way the hair like the face and the hair is done for this and the tomato.

2608
01:43:55,570 --> 01:43:57,470
Because like I like the tomatoes.

2609
01:43:57,470 --> 01:44:09,930
Seems like like it doesn't blend like, you know, I mean, it doesn't blend into the piece and and and there's like in the like it's like its own thing too.

2610
01:44:10,170 --> 01:44:14,310
So like the tomato and the Dragoon doesn't blend right in.

2611
01:44:14,470 --> 01:44:19,710
So I really like that about this piece that they're very it looks like it's 3D.

2612
01:44:19,810 --> 01:44:21,530
You know what I'm saying?

2613
01:44:23,130 --> 01:44:25,770
It looks like it has dimension to it.

2614
01:44:25,830 --> 01:44:27,230
So there's like a shadow too.

2615
01:44:27,230 --> 01:44:27,970
Over here.

2616
01:44:28,110 --> 01:44:29,470
So like this is the front.

2617
01:44:29,610 --> 01:44:32,970
This is like the front piece and this is like the back plate of it.

2618
01:44:33,050 --> 01:44:35,010
It looks it could be like an acrylic block.

2619
01:44:35,130 --> 01:44:36,930
So that's what I like about this piece as well.

2620
01:44:36,990 --> 01:44:37,410
The shading.

2621
01:44:37,450 --> 01:44:38,430
Yeah, the shading and everything.

2622
01:44:38,810 --> 01:44:39,710
All right, this one.

2623
01:44:39,910 --> 01:44:40,170
Okay.

2624
01:44:40,530 --> 01:44:41,430
Yes, this one.

2625
01:44:43,110 --> 01:44:47,150
Guys remember where your eyes are before I flip back guys.

2626
01:44:47,250 --> 01:44:49,890
And you guys remember where your eyes are.

2627
01:44:54,670 --> 01:44:56,490
Remember where to put your eyes.

2628
01:44:58,150 --> 01:45:00,750
I have 11 now.

2629
01:45:00,930 --> 01:45:03,130
I like that guy was like I have 10 favorite pieces.

2630
01:45:03,250 --> 01:45:04,670
Well now I have 11.

2631
01:45:05,970 --> 01:45:10,250
So this one is by Rosen Cruz.

2632
01:45:17,790 --> 01:45:22,170
And yeah, I'll say a lot of it.

2633
01:45:22,310 --> 01:45:25,870
There's a lot of very well done like from the gun.

2634
01:45:27,370 --> 01:45:31,890
To the line work to the shading to

2635
01:45:38,910 --> 01:45:40,690
Just a lot of stuff.

2636
01:45:41,730 --> 01:45:43,710
Yes, the hair is really nice.

2637
01:45:43,790 --> 01:45:48,130
There's like the line work on the hair itself too is very well done.

2638
01:45:48,210 --> 01:45:51,710
And I realized I have like earrings to be look at closer.

2639
01:45:51,890 --> 01:45:54,950
You can see there's like earrings on the ears with the chain and everything.

2640
01:45:55,870 --> 01:45:59,670
And it's just like the line work and shading itself is just really nice.

2641
01:45:59,810 --> 01:46:05,210
And the shading on the clothes and like the game like the background is a city as well.

2642
01:46:05,430 --> 01:46:12,490
The background over there is like the city backdrop with like the gamers up logo and everything.

2643
01:46:12,790 --> 01:46:14,010
And yeah.

2644
01:46:15,330 --> 01:46:15,610
Yeah.

2645
01:46:18,090 --> 01:46:21,590
Yeah, and then there's another one here by Rosen.

2646
01:46:22,550 --> 01:46:24,790
This one is like the after party.

2647
01:46:25,870 --> 01:46:27,030
Yeah, party.

2648
01:46:29,270 --> 01:46:37,210
And this one would be like if I was able to do if I was like a lot older.

2649
01:46:38,490 --> 01:46:40,850
That's how I'll describe it.

2650
01:46:44,490 --> 01:46:45,910
I was called this piece.

2651
01:46:46,130 --> 01:46:49,990
What if Joki was a lot older than she is now?

2652
01:46:56,890 --> 01:47:00,790
This is the auntie dokey.

2653
01:47:00,930 --> 01:47:03,330
The auntie dokey piece.

2654
01:47:03,690 --> 01:47:10,890
I mean, it's the same artist and I have the same comments regarding regarding this artwork.

2655
01:47:11,110 --> 01:47:12,030
It is.

2656
01:47:13,630 --> 01:47:14,510
Wow.

2657
01:47:15,010 --> 01:47:16,650
Eyes are up here guys.

2658
01:47:17,530 --> 01:47:20,430
Eyes are up here.

2659
01:47:22,590 --> 01:47:23,030
Anyway.

2660
01:47:23,030 --> 01:47:25,790
Anyway, we're at 90.

2661
01:47:26,300 --> 01:47:33,910
We have 15 more to go chat 15 more to go 15 wonderful artworks to go.

2662
01:47:34,070 --> 01:47:38,950
So here we have Rook CL.

2663
01:47:39,270 --> 01:47:41,590
I love the little smoke detail.

2664
01:47:41,790 --> 01:47:48,250
So it's like like I'm like finger guns like bang bang and then like, you know blowing the smoke away.

2665
01:47:49,100 --> 01:47:51,810
So and then like I don't know if you guys could don't see it.

2666
01:47:51,870 --> 01:47:52,890
But the gamers up.

2667
01:47:52,890 --> 01:47:56,110
Logo are in the flower right here.

2668
01:47:56,770 --> 01:47:57,910
It's so creative.

2669
01:47:58,150 --> 01:48:06,950
It's like it's like the petals on the flower and then there's me also here and the fact that there's dokey in the background and it's not just a regular rectangle.

2670
01:48:07,330 --> 01:48:10,450
They added more dimension to the background itself.

2671
01:48:10,570 --> 01:48:17,570
And then the fact that I don't know the perspective is really nice because you can see that it gets smaller as you look down.

2672
01:48:17,870 --> 01:48:19,570
Yeah, it's like a texture too.

2673
01:48:19,730 --> 01:48:21,230
Yeah, it gets smaller when you look down.

2674
01:48:21,270 --> 01:48:22,670
So the perspective is really well.

2675
01:48:22,670 --> 01:48:24,090
Well done in general for this one.

2676
01:48:24,170 --> 01:48:26,390
I know this piece is very really very pretty.

2677
01:48:27,990 --> 01:48:29,470
90 where we going?

2678
01:48:29,590 --> 01:48:31,370
We talk Airport Ninja.

2679
01:48:31,570 --> 01:48:32,850
Thank you for the super chat.

2680
01:48:33,030 --> 01:48:33,350
Thank you.

2681
01:48:33,370 --> 01:48:34,130
Thank you.

2682
01:48:34,550 --> 01:48:35,190
All right.

2683
01:48:35,230 --> 01:48:39,970
This one is by Rook CL.

2684
01:48:40,670 --> 01:48:42,250
I really enjoy.

2685
01:48:42,330 --> 01:48:45,750
I really liked the way they did the shading for this.

2686
01:48:45,830 --> 01:48:51,630
I don't you see it from here the red green and blue but they put the hair shading a different color.

2687
01:48:52,670 --> 01:48:55,810
It flows so naturally to like the transparency.

2688
01:48:56,390 --> 01:49:18,730
So it looks oh my gosh when you look at the how the liquid is going to like the gamer sub drink is going to come through that the the the way it's done just looks like it just looks very natural on how like the colors come through in general like the drink comes through and I like how it has the trophy as the Oshima clip on there and there's me too.

2689
01:49:18,890 --> 01:49:19,310
There's me.

2690
01:49:19,310 --> 01:49:20,090
There's you as well.

2691
01:49:20,190 --> 01:49:21,730
I don't know where your hand is going.

2692
01:49:21,730 --> 01:49:22,790
I'm a little concerned.

2693
01:49:26,550 --> 01:49:27,870
But you're here too.

2694
01:49:30,010 --> 01:49:35,130
Here we have s2nani07262.

2695
01:49:37,530 --> 01:49:38,650
I like the style.

2696
01:49:38,830 --> 01:49:46,890
I like how I like I feel like I think this is like the clouded the clouds or I think this is like the gamer sub liquids.

2697
01:49:47,770 --> 01:49:48,510
The camera.

2698
01:49:48,570 --> 01:49:51,230
I don't know why I call it liquids, but I like how the I like.

2699
01:49:51,290 --> 01:49:51,710
I don't know.

2700
01:49:51,730 --> 01:49:57,570
Like the way this background is done is like super creative in a way.

2701
01:49:57,710 --> 01:50:00,410
And then there's me be like, hey, hi, I'm Paul.

2702
01:50:02,330 --> 01:50:04,530
That's how I see myself.

2703
01:50:04,790 --> 01:50:05,310
Sometimes.

2704
01:50:05,330 --> 01:50:06,310
Hi, I'm Paul.

2705
01:50:13,650 --> 01:50:28,570
Anyway, anyway, anyway, as I was saying, face is really pretty like the art style in general is just incredibly pretty in general.

2706
01:50:28,790 --> 01:50:37,350
And I like the fact that I don't know like the way this background is done is just I can't take my eyes off like the composition in general.

2707
01:50:37,570 --> 01:50:41,490
And yeah, it looks like a manga panel.

2708
01:50:41,710 --> 01:50:41,870
Yeah.

2709
01:50:41,990 --> 01:50:42,550
Yeah, I agree.

2710
01:50:42,730 --> 01:50:50,270
It looks like a manga panel and I'm going to be like poke and I'm just like poke.

2711
01:50:50,670 --> 01:50:51,710
I'm here to poke you.

2712
01:50:53,370 --> 01:50:54,250
All right.

2713
01:50:54,490 --> 01:50:54,930
92.

2714
01:50:55,490 --> 01:50:58,390
This is by Sarah Senia 92.

2715
01:50:58,870 --> 01:51:01,050
Don't wait when we actually show the results.

2716
01:51:01,330 --> 01:51:06,970
It's going to be a lot faster because I don't have to talk about a lot individual pieces because I already have talked about them.

2717
01:51:07,970 --> 01:51:17,210
So so when we get to the finalist, it'll be a lot easier because I'm just showing you guys who got picked and like tell give me my reasons why they got picked and stuff.

2718
01:51:19,870 --> 01:51:20,310
Yes.

2719
01:51:20,310 --> 01:51:20,870
Yes.

2720
01:51:21,030 --> 01:51:26,070
So this is like parasite success.

2721
01:51:27,810 --> 01:51:28,790
Infection success.

2722
01:51:30,040 --> 01:51:32,090
So yeah reveals the tomato inside.

2723
01:51:32,670 --> 01:51:34,250
I really like that.

2724
01:51:35,390 --> 01:51:41,250
The way the way they chose the transparency for this works really well.

2725
01:51:41,350 --> 01:51:45,830
I mean, it's a good pick with the hair color in the trophy, but it also balances really out.

2726
01:51:45,910 --> 01:51:49,770
Well when I looked at like the color comparison to it balances.

2727
01:51:49,770 --> 01:51:55,490
Really well in general and then like how like, you know, everybody's here everybody's here with the bunnies.

2728
01:51:55,590 --> 01:51:59,990
There's me and the tomato and just like the line art is really beautiful.

2729
01:52:00,950 --> 01:52:02,830
Like the pen work in the line art.

2730
01:52:03,970 --> 01:52:04,690
In general.

2731
01:52:04,830 --> 01:52:07,630
It looks like they it looks like an inked drawing.

2732
01:52:08,150 --> 01:52:09,610
That's what it looks like to me.

2733
01:52:09,770 --> 01:52:13,850
It looks like an inked drawing here, which is really cool.

2734
01:52:15,890 --> 01:52:16,730
All right, this one.

2735
01:52:16,810 --> 01:52:17,550
This is called.

2736
01:52:17,570 --> 01:52:19,210
This is screet tuber.

2737
01:52:20,590 --> 01:52:22,210
I love the style.

2738
01:52:22,450 --> 01:52:23,670
It's very unique.

2739
01:52:23,990 --> 01:52:29,570
Like this style is very different from all the other entries.

2740
01:52:29,710 --> 01:52:33,310
And I like how like I'm breaking through the glass, you know?

2741
01:52:34,150 --> 01:52:35,730
Yeah, it's very different.

2742
01:52:35,870 --> 01:52:39,610
It was a very different style from a lot of the entries.

2743
01:52:39,670 --> 01:52:42,890
I looked at and I don't like the face.

2744
01:52:43,090 --> 01:52:45,370
The face is so pretty.

2745
01:52:47,610 --> 01:52:47,890
Yeah.

2746
01:52:48,050 --> 01:52:49,450
Yeah, I haven't seen this.

2747
01:52:49,770 --> 01:52:55,890
Dial before the fact that like it's like half lineless artwork and half line work.

2748
01:52:58,010 --> 01:53:13,570
So like it's just very interesting to look at in general just because it's like it's such a it's very different and it was very it's just very pretty to look at.

2749
01:53:13,730 --> 01:53:13,970
Yeah.

2750
01:53:14,390 --> 01:53:19,290
Yeah, it's just it's just like I can't stop looking at the face.

2751
01:53:19,770 --> 01:53:23,230
You know, but this is by screet tuber.

2752
01:53:23,470 --> 01:53:24,090
All right.

2753
01:53:25,530 --> 01:53:26,550
Seer seer.

2754
01:53:28,950 --> 01:53:32,270
I just I love how like mecha time.

2755
01:53:34,490 --> 01:53:38,510
Like the idea that I'm just getting the robot.

2756
01:53:42,030 --> 01:53:45,070
Like get it get in the robot.

2757
01:53:45,150 --> 01:53:45,550

2758
01:53:45,850 --> 01:53:46,190
Yeah.

2759
01:53:47,910 --> 01:53:48,590
Yeah.

2760
01:53:48,650 --> 01:53:49,150
Yeah.

01:53:49,150 --> 01:53:49,550
Yeah.

2762
01:53:49,550 --> 01:53:49,750
Yeah.

2763
01:53:49,750 --> 01:53:55,930
, I just thought it was such a funny and cute piece regarding any like, hey, I'm Paul.

2764
01:53:56,770 --> 01:53:59,450
So I'm Paul over here.

2765
01:53:59,650 --> 01:54:01,270
Get in the skin suit.

2766
01:54:01,330 --> 01:54:03,290
Doki inside.

2767
01:54:03,770 --> 01:54:08,870
I don't I can't believe inside to is like the most popular animated movie.

2768
01:54:08,990 --> 01:54:15,770
Not in not including inflation, but that movie did not deserve to be it's a decent movie, but it's literally inside out one.

2769
01:54:15,870 --> 01:54:17,170
Like I don't know what to say.

2770
01:54:17,770 --> 01:54:19,390
It's literally inside out.

2771
01:54:19,390 --> 01:54:22,350
Not one, but they just added new emotion.

2772
01:54:24,270 --> 01:54:28,190
But yeah, I just thought it was like super creative and I love that.

2773
01:54:28,270 --> 01:54:30,070
I just love the way they did the tomato.

2774
01:54:30,230 --> 01:54:31,270
It is so funny.

2775
01:54:33,170 --> 01:54:36,890
This is said Bakan Ken.

2776
01:54:39,210 --> 01:54:40,730
I love okay.

2777
01:54:40,790 --> 01:54:46,150
I look did they change the shirt to the gamer stuff logo and then the trophy.

2778
01:54:46,230 --> 01:54:47,130
Oh my God.

2779
01:54:47,150 --> 01:54:48,630
The trophy is so detailed.

2780
01:54:48,630 --> 01:54:50,690
And those oh my God.

2781
01:54:50,790 --> 01:54:51,670
These heels.

2782
01:54:53,710 --> 01:54:57,150
I can kill a person with those heels.

2783
01:54:59,650 --> 01:55:03,310
I love how like this trophy.

2784
01:55:03,490 --> 01:55:10,130
The trophy is like it's very well illustrated for the trophy and just the composition in general of everything.

2785
01:55:10,410 --> 01:55:15,990
Like it's just it's just a really nice drawing overall and we're falling catches.

2786
01:55:16,170 --> 01:55:18,550
No, maybe it was me.

2787
01:55:18,630 --> 01:55:19,810
I'd be like goodbye.

2788
01:55:21,670 --> 01:55:23,450
But I love the composition.

2789
01:55:23,610 --> 01:55:28,490
I love how the backgrounds and I love how the pose in general the colors of the color selection and everything.

2790
01:55:28,990 --> 01:55:31,310
It's just very well drawn.

2791
01:55:33,410 --> 01:55:37,770
This one by seriously McGain.

2792
01:55:37,910 --> 01:55:40,190
I love the line art.

2793
01:55:40,230 --> 01:55:41,490
This is a different art style.

2794
01:55:41,550 --> 01:55:45,710
It's much more creative, but I love the background.

2795
01:55:45,850 --> 01:55:48,290
I love how they did.

2796
01:55:48,630 --> 01:55:54,050
The background because it's like it's just so I like I don't know.

2797
01:55:54,130 --> 01:55:54,410
What's the word?

2798
01:55:54,490 --> 01:56:05,550
It's like very I could see this as a t-shirt type deal, you know, like so like it's something you can see like maybe it's from like an animate like an animation or something.

2799
01:56:05,750 --> 01:56:07,170
Yeah, it's like pop art.

2800
01:56:07,370 --> 01:56:15,930
Yeah, it's very I love how it's very stylistic and it's just the background.

2801
01:56:15,990 --> 01:56:18,230
Just feel is just very pretty.

2802
01:56:18,630 --> 01:56:28,650
I think the background is just really pretty and I love how the line art the liner the differences in liner.

2803
01:56:28,750 --> 01:56:30,990
I believe I'm the moon here too.

2804
01:56:31,190 --> 01:56:36,650
I believe I believe this is the moon.

2805
01:56:38,090 --> 01:56:43,570
But I just very much enjoy the composition in this overall here.

2806
01:56:43,730 --> 01:56:45,930
We have Shady Cat.

2807
01:56:46,530 --> 01:56:47,570
I love the.

2808
01:56:48,630 --> 01:56:50,310
Use of screen tone for this.

2809
01:56:50,990 --> 01:57:06,390
The fact that like they played around with different types of screen tone different shapes to like the the what's the word these shapes of the brush of the screen tone and like just how like it's like colored.

2810
01:57:06,470 --> 01:57:07,050
It's so clean.

2811
01:57:07,190 --> 01:57:11,650
Yeah, I really like I just really like the shading and just this one that's Shady Cat.

2812
01:57:12,510 --> 01:57:15,650
All right, we're almost at the final stretch guys.

2813
01:57:15,750 --> 01:57:18,370
We have 12 more to go 12.

2814
01:57:18,370 --> 01:57:21,410
More 12 more and then we announce who wins.

2815
01:57:23,930 --> 01:57:25,590
We're very good 12 more to go.

2816
01:57:25,730 --> 01:57:29,530
I can't believe I showed almost a hundred hundred artwork.

2817
01:57:30,350 --> 01:57:33,630
This is shark e Tron.

2818
01:57:35,230 --> 01:57:37,570
I love how it includes everybody.

2819
01:57:37,590 --> 01:57:38,650
It's so dynamic.

2820
01:57:38,670 --> 01:57:39,990
Like it's just so cute.

2821
01:57:40,130 --> 01:57:41,030
Not enough dynamics.

2822
01:57:41,030 --> 01:57:47,750
Not the right word, but like I love how it has everybody that Chonky goon regular goon the bun buns.

2823
01:57:49,030 --> 01:57:59,550
Egg goon long goon tomato and then like the thief outfit and then the game yourself logo and it's just in my assets.

2824
01:58:00,230 --> 01:58:07,130

2825
01:58:07,510 --> 01:58:08,430

Okay, let's focus on my wonderful personality.

2830

Anyway, here we have Shaycee.

This is like you left your tomato out in the sun for too long.

2870
02:02:07,940 --> 02:02:10,860
You left your tomato out in the sun.

2871
02:02:13,900 --> 02:02:16,240
But I love the way.

2872
02:02:16,240 --> 02:02:19,880
I love the way like the whole thing is composed as well.

2873
02:02:20,040 --> 02:02:21,380
I love this guy's expression.

2874
02:02:21,900 --> 02:02:23,520
I love it.

2875
02:02:23,520 --> 02:02:29,500
It's like he's just like he's just like hello.

2876
02:02:29,680 --> 02:02:32,740
You left me out in the sun for five hours.

2877
02:02:35,340 --> 02:02:36,520
It's a to me.

2878
02:02:37,840 --> 02:02:42,360
You left me out in the sun for five days.

2879
02:02:43,080 --> 02:02:43,700
Please.

2880
02:02:44,400 --> 02:02:45,020
Please.

2881
02:02:45,600 --> 02:02:46,220
Please.

2882
02:02:49,340 --> 02:02:50,540
Too much game.

2883
02:02:50,620 --> 02:02:53,120
No, there's no such no too little gamer subs.

2884
02:02:53,360 --> 02:02:54,660
Too little gamer subs.

2885
02:02:54,720 --> 02:02:58,320
You better use my code to feed this to fix this tomato.

2886
02:03:01,880 --> 02:03:03,960
Anyway, I love the composition.

2887
02:03:04,200 --> 02:03:05,460
I love like the idea.

2888
02:03:05,640 --> 02:03:10,660
I like how like it's holding a gamer subs within the gamer subs, which I thought was really cute.

2889
02:03:11,220 --> 02:03:12,940
And I just love like the way it's done.

2890
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:14,340
The style is really cute in general.

2891
02:03:15,160 --> 02:03:17,300
And then we have Star Knights.

2892
02:03:17,400 --> 02:03:18,060
OMG.

2893
02:03:18,400 --> 02:03:22,260
The face when they draw the teeth like that.

2894
02:03:22,460 --> 02:03:28,680
The way sometimes when artists do that type of art with the mouth down mouth.

2895
02:03:28,880 --> 02:03:29,280
Yes.

2896
02:03:29,660 --> 02:03:36,100
There's some artists that draw like this for the mouths and it's like mwah like chef's kiss.

2897
02:03:36,320 --> 02:03:44,040
Like oh the yes the thing the way they shade the mouth like ah, it's just that was just the way.

2898
02:03:44,040 --> 02:03:44,680
They draw mouths.

2899
02:03:44,960 --> 02:03:46,320
It's like the teeth enjoys.

2900
02:03:46,620 --> 02:03:50,140
Yeah, I like the things and stuff.

2901
02:03:51,460 --> 02:03:55,020
Yeah, I just I just can't stop looking at the face.

2902
02:03:55,120 --> 02:04:10,300
It's just a really nice way of drawing the face, especially the mouth the shading on like you can see the backside of the backside of the jaw teeth to like right here and then the colors of the mouth and then the trophy is really well.

2903
02:04:10,320 --> 02:04:12,100
I really like the trophy design too.

2904
02:04:12,260 --> 02:04:13,940
Like it's like I won a race.

2905
02:04:14,040 --> 02:04:14,560
In general.

2906
02:04:15,720 --> 02:04:18,760
But yeah, this is love how they draw faces.

2907
02:04:19,560 --> 02:04:21,780
This one start with the same nose.

2908
02:04:21,840 --> 02:04:22,980
Okay, they both have star.

2909
02:04:23,420 --> 02:04:25,240
They both had stars.

2910
02:04:25,260 --> 02:04:26,160
So I got confused.

2911
02:04:26,700 --> 02:04:27,520

2912
02:04:27,820 --> 02:04:28,260
More.

2915
02:04:35,780 --> 02:04:36,960
I love the shading.

2916
02:04:37,520 --> 02:04:41,360
It's just like I'm pretty sure this is a gradient too.

2917
02:04:41,520 --> 02:04:44,960
I love the shading and like it looks like I was like.

2918
02:04:44,960 --> 02:04:51,420
I won like a gladiator fight because this reminds me of like the Roman like Hercules.

2919
02:04:51,660 --> 02:05:03,380
Like it reminds me of Hercules and like the trophy but the shading is really well done and little sparkles to like like like I said the camera Sparkle.

2920
02:05:03,380 --> 02:05:03,940

2933
02:05:49,080 --> 02:05:51,820
The tomato is overstimulated.

2934

2935
02:05:54,980 --> 02:05:57,280

I find like I won.

2944

I won the sport, you know, like when you're playing the sport thing and then you win the sport and then look like the tomatoes cheering on in the background to here and then you you know, you pour.

2945
02:06:32,860 --> 02:06:34,720
I think this is American thing too.

2946
02:06:34,860 --> 02:06:38,820
I'm pretty sure I've only seen this happening in TV shows and movies.

2947
02:06:38,840 --> 02:06:44,040
So I don't know it like if this is an actual thing people do but I really.

2948
02:06:44,200 --> 02:06:44,860
I but it's it.

02:06:44,960 --> 02:06:47,640
I thought this is a really cute composite like a cute idea.

That's great.

2953
02:06:57,600 --> 02:06:58,640
This is white.

2954
02:06:58,760 --> 02:06:59,620
This is gray.

2955
02:07:05,080 --> 02:07:05,960
It's Gatorade.

2956
02:07:06,900 --> 02:07:09,540

2963
02:07:42,100 --> 02:07:42,760

2964
02:07:42,760 --> 02:07:46,700

Oh, wow.

2971
02:08:13,540 --> 02:08:16,200

2974
02:08:26,720 --> 02:08:31,360
But I really love this like how smug I look for this one.

3000
02:10:20,770 --> 02:10:23,840
Yet the honest tomato in the background here.

3001
02:10:29,780 --> 02:10:33,440
So I really love the style and I love the Dragoon.

3002
02:10:33,500 --> 02:10:35,280
You look like such a Sanrio character.

3003
02:10:37,430 --> 02:10:38,080
I'm drowning.

3004
02:10:38,260 --> 02:10:39,220
This is by you.

3005
02:10:41,700 --> 02:10:46,300
I'm just like drowning in caper stuff.

3006
02:10:46,440 --> 02:10:48,340
That's all I can describe it.

3007
02:10:48,400 --> 02:10:53,440
I thought that was I thought I was really funny away later.

3008
02:10:53,580 --> 02:10:55,460
You got to drink all your caper supper.

3009
02:10:55,500 --> 02:10:56,460
I'll drown.

3010
02:10:57,170 --> 02:11:02,400
I thought the I thought the idea was incredibly creative.

3011
02:11:04,460 --> 02:11:07,000
That's chatting of my comfort.

3012
02:11:07,380 --> 02:11:07,860
Great.

3013
02:11:07,860 --> 02:11:09,340
Don't drink the substance.

3014
02:11:09,340 --> 02:11:10,120
Save her.

3015
02:11:10,770 --> 02:11:11,320
I thought.

3016
02:11:11,320 --> 02:11:13,280
I thought the idea was incredibly creative.

3017
02:11:13,660 --> 02:11:15,900
Yeah, drink faster.

3018
02:11:16,260 --> 02:11:17,700
You had to chug it.

3019
02:11:17,880 --> 02:11:19,200
You had to chug it.

3020
02:11:19,800 --> 02:11:23,620
But the concept was really well done.

3021
02:11:25,900 --> 02:11:29,060
Here is the pocket droid.

3022
02:11:29,300 --> 02:11:30,040
I love okay.

3023
02:11:30,180 --> 02:11:31,140
You guys don't notice this.

3024
02:11:31,280 --> 02:11:38,360
The background is like money silhouettes of the money and I love the use of line art.

3025
02:11:38,400 --> 02:11:39,560
Wait on this.

3026
02:11:39,740 --> 02:11:40,540
Like it's so.

3027
02:11:42,600 --> 02:11:44,840
Bold like is that the right word?

3028
02:11:44,980 --> 02:12:05,980
Like it's the the line art is very bold and yeah, it's very cool to look at the liner in general because it's like the weight of the line art is is very in like not what's the word is very crisp and like interesting to look at.

3029
02:12:06,080 --> 02:12:08,580
Yeah, because there's like the thickness of the lines here.

3030
02:12:08,660 --> 02:12:11,120
But then they play around with the weight of the line.

3031
02:12:11,120 --> 02:12:14,800
And then there's like little shading with line art to like the way they'd line art.

3032
02:12:14,900 --> 02:12:16,440
This is just very dying.

3033
02:12:16,620 --> 02:12:17,980
Like it's just a really nice style.

3034
02:12:18,220 --> 02:12:31,440
I really enjoyed the sound and I like the how the background is like the silhouettes of money in the background, which I thought was really interesting last to this one is by Zara.

3035
02:12:31,540 --> 02:12:32,600
Neon 17.

3036
02:12:34,620 --> 02:12:38,840
So I like the checkered background.

3037
02:12:38,920 --> 02:12:40,540
It really balances the whole piece.

3038
02:12:40,540 --> 02:12:44,040
So but I really it's just a really cute art style.

3039
02:12:44,300 --> 02:12:49,740

Yeah, that's what I look like and then squishing the chunk moon.

3042
02:12:59,920 --> 02:13:07,840
I think the face is like really cutely drawn and then I love how the little chunky coolness like in between my arms.

3043
02:13:08,540 --> 02:13:10,520
And I'm just like hugging you guys.

3044
02:13:10,520 --> 02:13:20,200
And the gamers of logo is like the clip on the you know, how like it's like one of the one of the the symbols from the car playing cars.

3045
02:13:20,400 --> 02:13:24,780
And then they use the gamer sub gamer sub logo for for it.

3046
02:13:28,160 --> 02:13:29,300
Eyes are up here.

3047
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:31,920
This is by Julio.

3048
02:13:33,120 --> 02:13:36,500
Okay guys remember eyes are up here.

3049
02:13:36,660 --> 02:13:37,180
Hahaha.

3050
02:13:40,060 --> 02:13:40,580
Hahaha.

3051
02:13:40,600 --> 02:13:40,800
Hahaha.

3052
02:13:40,800 --> 02:13:41,200
Hahaha.

3053
02:13:41,200 --> 02:13:41,600
Hahaha.

3054
02:13:41,600 --> 02:13:42,020
Hahaha.

3055
02:13:42,940 --> 02:13:46,640
But it's a very... well, it's very well drawn.

3056
02:13:46,760 --> 02:13:49,720
And like the pose itself, like it's a very confident pose.

3057
02:13:49,980 --> 02:13:50,680
That's for sure.

3058
02:13:50,840 --> 02:13:55,920
It's a very... It's a very confident pose.

3059
02:13:56,180 --> 02:13:59,540
And then, oh my god, I love how I'm holding a gun.

3060
02:13:59,720 --> 02:14:02,480
And I'm like, yeah, what are you looking at, buddy?

3061
02:14:06,780 --> 02:14:12,200
But yes, as you all know, there are other parts of this drawing that's also very well illustrated.

3062
02:14:12,460 --> 02:14:14,820
But I shall focus on the eyes right now.

3063
02:14:14,900 --> 02:14:18,560
I shall focus on the eyes.

3064
02:14:19,860 --> 02:14:22,680
And so... and then the rest is these two.

3065
02:14:23,420 --> 02:14:25,160
Do you guys see the other two?

3066
02:14:25,700 --> 02:14:26,040
Alright.

3067
02:14:26,280 --> 02:14:27,620
Alright, so...

3068
02:14:27,620 --> 02:14:30,660
I would like drum roll, please.

3069
02:14:31,300 --> 02:14:32,180
Should I go?

3070
02:14:32,320 --> 02:14:35,040
Okay, I will do honorable mentions.

3071
02:14:35,160 --> 02:14:38,840
I will start from the bottom for honorable mentions.

3072
02:14:38,880 --> 02:14:41,860
And then we'll go... we'll go up from there.

3073
02:14:41,960 --> 02:14:42,280
So...

3074
02:14:42,460 --> 02:14:43,540
Drum roll!

3075
02:14:45,720 --> 02:14:47,480
Drum roll, please!

3076
02:14:49,180 --> 02:14:50,440
We're finally here.

3077
02:14:50,620 --> 02:14:54,900
It only took us two hours to get through 100 plus entries.

3078
02:14:55,120 --> 02:15:01,320
Now imagine my assistant trying to get through 700 entries to narrow it down to 100.

3079
02:15:01,640 --> 02:15:04,060
And then I had to narrow it down to 34.

3080
02:15:04,480 --> 02:15:10,560
So like a round of applause for my assistant for getting through 700 entries.

3081
02:15:10,640 --> 02:15:12,340
To narrow it down to 100.

3082
02:15:12,340 --> 02:15:15,260
And then I had to narrow it down to 34.

3083
02:15:19,060 --> 02:15:21,340
So honorable mentions...

3084
02:15:23,020 --> 02:15:24,140
They... unfortunately...

3085
02:15:24,840 --> 02:15:27,880
There's no like prize money for honorable mention.

3086
02:15:28,100 --> 02:15:30,860
But I still wanted to like give you guys like, you know, a mention.

3087
02:15:32,940 --> 02:15:36,580
When I picked... like I said, when I picked these artwork...

3088
02:15:36,580 --> 02:15:39,920
I picked... I chose versus personality.

3089
02:15:40,700 --> 02:15:42,320
I... like... how... does it fit?

3090
02:15:42,320 --> 02:15:45,860
Does it fit my personality for the top 20... top 22?

3091
02:15:46,020 --> 02:15:47,340
And like with honorable mentions.

3092
02:15:47,620 --> 02:15:50,300
I looked at like, does it fit my personality?

3093
02:15:51,000 --> 02:15:56,080
Is it... is it like something that I think would look really good on a cup?

3094
02:15:56,600 --> 02:16:01,420
Do I... I wanted to have different styles represented in the top 22.

3095
02:16:03,120 --> 02:16:05,740
And... well, the top 20 plus honorable mentions.

3096
02:16:05,880 --> 02:16:11,360
I wanted the composition created like the creativity and the... the creativity.

3097
02:16:11,360 --> 02:16:17,960
And how it's... how like they took the idea to make the artwork.

3098
02:16:18,400 --> 02:16:20,600
Um... stuff like that.

3099
02:16:20,740 --> 02:16:23,760
I know some people might be like, oh, that's not in my...

3100
02:16:23,760 --> 02:16:26,660
This is... I got... I did the final judgment, guys.

3101
02:16:26,740 --> 02:16:29,520
In the end, I did the final judgment for everything.

3102
02:16:29,980 --> 02:16:34,180
Um... so like maybe some of your favorite pieces aren't in the honorable mentions.

3103
02:16:34,380 --> 02:16:38,280
Or... um... or... uh... or like the top 22.

3104
02:16:38,440 --> 02:16:39,760
It was very difficult.

3105
02:16:40,020 --> 02:16:41,200
It was so difficult.

3106
02:16:41,360 --> 02:16:43,260
I also wanted to give attention to like...

3107
02:16:43,260 --> 02:16:47,540
I feel like artists that like different types of art styles as well.

3108
02:16:47,920 --> 02:16:51,480
Um... I wanted to have like different types of art styles and everything.

3109
02:16:51,680 --> 02:16:56,640
So... um... it was... it was def... it was so hard to pick.

3110
02:16:56,840 --> 02:16:57,360
I...

3111
02:16:57,360 --> 02:17:03,600
It was... it was honestly one of the hardest decisions I had to make for this.

3112
02:17:03,840 --> 02:17:06,140
Anyway, we'll start with honorable mentions.

3113
02:17:08,420 --> 02:17:10,980
Our first honorable mention from...

3114
02:17:11,360 --> 02:17:12,180
Clero Art.

3115
02:17:12,960 --> 02:17:13,480
Um...

3116
02:17:14,440 --> 02:17:17,500
I won't be describing too much of the...

3117
02:17:17,500 --> 02:17:19,660
Artwork pieces regarding...

3118
02:17:19,660 --> 02:17:22,620
Um... I think I'll start describing them more when we're at the top five.

3119
02:17:22,880 --> 02:17:24,680
But this is our first honorable mention.

3120
02:17:25,000 --> 02:17:26,920
Congratulations to Clero Art.

3121
02:17:27,260 --> 02:17:30,180
Uh... for... for getting to the top 34.

3122
02:17:31,080 --> 02:17:32,780
Um... so... congratulations.

3123
02:17:32,980 --> 02:17:35,360
The honorable mentions are not ranked, by the way.

3124
02:17:35,440 --> 02:17:37,440
It's just how... wherever I place them.

3125
02:17:37,600 --> 02:17:39,940
They're not... It's not like this is the 34th piece.

3126
02:17:40,140 --> 02:17:40,780
Um... it's...

3127
02:17:40,780 --> 02:17:42,340
They're not placed anywhere.

3128
02:17:42,680 --> 02:17:44,820
Um, similar with 6th to 20th.

3129
02:17:44,880 --> 02:17:46,820
They don't have like a placement for them.

3130
02:17:46,960 --> 02:17:50,180
It's only, they're all grouped up together in 6th to 20th.

3131
02:17:50,240 --> 02:17:52,520
So, Claro Art is the first honorable mention.

3132
02:17:53,480 --> 02:17:54,000
Um...

3133
02:17:54,960 --> 02:17:56,300
Sweet and Round...

3134
02:17:56,300 --> 02:17:58,640
Um, is the next honorable mention.

3135
02:17:59,280 --> 02:18:01,440
Um, I just really love the idea.

3136
02:18:01,620 --> 02:18:03,400
Like, I thought the idea was very creative.

3137
02:18:03,480 --> 02:18:06,320
And that's why I chose this one for the honorable mention.

3138
02:18:06,620 --> 02:18:13,060
The reason why I chose Claro Art for the honorable mention was because I just love the art style and the composition.

3139
02:18:13,080 --> 02:18:14,780
The slantedness of it.

3140
02:18:14,860 --> 02:18:17,940
I thought the slantedness of it was really nicely done.

3141
02:18:18,120 --> 02:18:19,200
Uh, very creative.

3142
02:18:19,300 --> 02:18:25,440
I think I gave Claro Art two honorable mentions because I loved both of their submissions.

3143
02:18:25,920 --> 02:18:29,460
So, I just thought it was very creative in a way.

3144
02:18:29,500 --> 02:18:30,900
Um, that they done it.

3145
02:18:30,980 --> 02:18:33,080
So, that's why they had two honorable mentions.

3146
02:18:33,480 --> 02:18:36,100
Um, Matt also got an honorable mention.

3147
02:18:36,400 --> 02:18:38,040
Uh, I love the style.

3148
02:18:38,040 --> 02:18:41,060
Um, I love the style of it.

3149
02:18:41,100 --> 02:18:43,300
And the creativity regarding like...

3150
02:18:43,300 --> 02:18:45,120
Um, it looks like a comic panel.

3151
02:18:45,700 --> 02:18:46,340
Um...

3152
02:18:47,060 --> 02:18:49,960
And I just love how creative it was.

3153
02:18:50,100 --> 02:18:53,120
And like the direction they took with...

3154
02:18:53,120 --> 02:18:55,700
Uh, with the piece for the artwork.

3155
02:18:57,300 --> 02:18:57,940
Um...

3156
02:18:57,940 --> 02:18:59,040
This one...

3157
02:18:59,040 --> 02:19:01,840
Uh, another honorable mention would be Lemmy.

3158
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:04,780
Um, I really liked the...

3159
02:19:04,780 --> 02:19:06,740
I just love the details and everything.

3160
02:19:06,740 --> 02:19:09,780
And the little dragoon pom-poms that everybody is in there included.

3161
02:19:10,140 --> 02:19:11,980
And the little dragoon pom-poms.

3162
02:19:12,020 --> 02:19:13,040
And just the little details.

3163
02:19:13,180 --> 02:19:16,100
Like you can see how much like the blush had screen tone and everything.

3164
02:19:16,660 --> 02:19:19,000
Um, so I just love the little details.

3165
02:19:19,440 --> 02:19:22,040
Um, another honorable mention is Frel.

3166
02:19:22,340 --> 02:19:25,240
Um, I love how dynamic the...

3167
02:19:25,240 --> 02:19:26,860
Like the background.

3168
02:19:26,940 --> 02:19:27,760
I just love the way...

3169
02:19:27,760 --> 02:19:29,760
The composition, the background, the pose.

3170
02:19:30,120 --> 02:19:32,520
And just how clean everything is.

3171
02:19:32,780 --> 02:19:35,500
So, that's why Frel is also an honorable mention.

3172
02:19:37,480 --> 02:19:40,420
Um, Hito also got an...

3173
02:19:40,420 --> 02:19:42,080
Whoa, you saw the other honorable mention.

3174
02:19:42,280 --> 02:19:42,480
But...

3175
02:19:43,840 --> 02:19:46,740
Um, Hito also got an honorable mention.

3176
02:19:47,040 --> 02:19:49,140
Um, it was a very cute art drawing.

3177
02:19:49,300 --> 02:19:50,000
And like...

3178
02:19:50,000 --> 02:19:52,560
I wanted every outfit to be represented.

3179
02:19:53,000 --> 02:19:57,800
I wanted every outfit to have a representation in the...

3180
02:19:57,800 --> 02:19:58,700
Uh...

3181
02:19:58,700 --> 02:20:01,020
In the top 34.

3182
02:20:01,320 --> 02:20:03,660
So, I had to pick...

3183
02:20:03,660 --> 02:20:06,720
I wanted to like have one of each outfit in the top 34.

3184
02:20:06,720 --> 02:20:10,840
So, I really liked Hito's rendition of this outfit.

3185
02:20:11,080 --> 02:20:12,300
I thought it was really cute.

3186
02:20:12,420 --> 02:20:14,820
And the fact that it looked like an emblem, per se.

3187
02:20:15,140 --> 02:20:17,680
Um, and like the symmetry of everything too.

3188
02:20:17,820 --> 02:20:19,780
So, Hito got an honorable mention.

3189
02:20:20,220 --> 02:20:23,000
Um, Screetuber, I already talked about it.

3190
02:20:23,080 --> 02:20:26,380
There's just something about the style that's just very captivating.

3191
02:20:26,640 --> 02:20:28,700
Um, and that's why...

3192
02:20:30,220 --> 02:20:34,720
Um, that's why I picked Screetuber as an honorable mention.

3193
02:20:34,960 --> 02:20:36,700
The style was just very...

3194
02:20:36,700 --> 02:20:39,960
Very captivating and very unique compared to the rest of the drawing.

3195
02:20:40,600 --> 02:20:41,280
Uh...

3196
02:20:41,280 --> 02:20:46,200
And finally, the last honorable mention is...

3197
02:20:46,200 --> 02:20:47,020
Taihen Gold.

3198
02:20:47,760 --> 02:20:48,480
Um...

3199
02:20:48,480 --> 02:20:50,740
Well, I just really love gamer subs.

3200
02:20:50,980 --> 02:20:51,520
Like...

3201
02:20:54,700 --> 02:20:56,140
I just...

3202
02:20:56,140 --> 02:20:58,540
I really love gamer subs.

3203
02:21:06,700 --> 02:21:06,900
That's...

3204
02:21:07,680 --> 02:21:08,540
That's really it.

3205
02:21:08,680 --> 02:21:09,520
Like, oh my god.

3206
02:21:09,580 --> 02:21:10,220
Gamer subs.

3207
02:21:10,480 --> 02:21:12,060
By the way, you can use 10%...

3208
02:21:12,060 --> 02:21:16,180
Use my gamer sub code, Doughkeeper, for 10% off.

3209
02:21:17,520 --> 02:21:18,120
Alright!

3210
02:21:19,540 --> 02:21:21,160
6th to 20th place.

3211
02:21:21,400 --> 02:21:25,060
I shall now showcase 6th to 20th place.

3212
02:21:25,880 --> 02:21:26,480
So...

3213
02:21:28,060 --> 02:21:28,660
Um...

3214
02:21:28,660 --> 02:21:30,540
The first winner...

3215
02:21:30,540 --> 02:21:31,220
Not winner, sorry.

3216
02:21:31,280 --> 02:21:33,600
The first person who placed...

3217
02:21:33,600 --> 02:21:34,400
Um...

3218
02:21:34,400 --> 02:21:35,820
Who placed in...

3219
02:21:35,820 --> 02:21:36,340
Uh...

3220
02:21:36,340 --> 02:21:39,100
Placed is 7M Digital.

3221
02:21:39,540 --> 02:21:40,460
I just...

3222
02:21:40,460 --> 02:21:43,980
I could see this as like a graphic t-shirt.

3223
02:21:44,100 --> 02:21:45,800
Like, I thought it was really...

3224
02:21:45,800 --> 02:21:48,120
The perspective and the...

3225
02:21:49,440 --> 02:21:50,000
Um...

3226
02:21:50,720 --> 02:21:51,280
Composition...

3227
02:21:52,060 --> 02:21:52,620
Um...

3228
02:21:52,620 --> 02:21:54,020
Is like...

3229
02:21:54,800 --> 02:21:57,420
I just thought it was like really interesting to look at.

3230
02:21:57,560 --> 02:21:59,500
And like, I love the way...

3231
02:21:59,500 --> 02:22:02,560
Like, the line art and the shading of everything was done.

3232
02:22:02,800 --> 02:22:05,500
So like, the background forces you to look at her.

3233
02:22:05,820 --> 02:22:06,200
Like, me.

3234
02:22:06,360 --> 02:22:06,680
Sorry.

3235
02:22:06,880 --> 02:22:07,360
Me.

3236
02:22:10,280 --> 02:22:11,460
Number one.

3237
02:22:11,560 --> 02:22:12,640
And so...

3238
02:22:12,640 --> 02:22:13,160
Um...

3239
02:22:13,160 --> 02:22:18,640
I really liked how the background forces your eyes to look at me here.

3240
02:22:18,860 --> 02:22:20,080
And I just love the...

3241
02:22:20,080 --> 02:22:21,880
How clean everything is too.

3242
02:22:22,000 --> 02:22:24,120
And the composition in general and the perspective.

3243
02:22:24,820 --> 02:22:25,480
Um...

3244
02:22:25,480 --> 02:22:29,480
And that's why 7M Digital made it to the final pick.

3245
02:22:29,660 --> 02:22:30,200
The finals.

3246
02:22:30,820 --> 02:22:31,480
Um...

3247
02:22:31,480 --> 02:22:32,380
Next up...

3248
02:22:32,380 --> 02:22:33,400
Is...

3249
02:22:33,400 --> 02:22:34,400
Uh...

3250
02:22:34,400 --> 02:22:36,680
Mala Leafy Daisy.

3251
02:22:37,060 --> 02:22:40,180
I love the background and the details.

3252
02:22:40,520 --> 02:22:41,840
I think like...

3253
02:22:42,400 --> 02:22:44,220
The background...

3254
02:22:44,220 --> 02:22:46,140
The void goons...

3255
02:22:46,140 --> 02:22:48,100
I just love this idea.

3256
02:22:48,380 --> 02:22:51,780
And that's why I placed it into my final judgement.

3257
02:22:53,220 --> 02:22:53,940
Because...

3258
02:22:53,940 --> 02:22:58,520
The dragoon background was very interesting and a very creative take.

3259
02:22:58,820 --> 02:22:59,320
Uh...

3260
02:22:59,320 --> 02:23:01,240
Compared to like a lot of the other entries.

3261
02:23:01,560 --> 02:23:03,660
I think the background was what...

3262
02:23:03,660 --> 02:23:04,460
Like...

3263
02:23:04,460 --> 02:23:06,200
Hooked me in the most.

3264
02:23:06,600 --> 02:23:07,200
Um...

3265
02:23:07,200 --> 02:23:09,800
The rest of the pieces also very well done.

3266
02:23:11,260 --> 02:23:12,460
And like...

3267
02:23:12,460 --> 02:23:12,980
Um...

3268
02:23:12,980 --> 02:23:15,000
The eyes are like really pretty.

3269
02:23:15,200 --> 02:23:16,800
The line work in general.

3270
02:23:16,940 --> 02:23:17,640
And everything.

3271
02:23:18,020 --> 02:23:18,500
And...

3272
02:23:18,500 --> 02:23:21,560
But like the background was what sold me the most.

3273
02:23:21,700 --> 02:23:23,440
I just felt like it was incredibly creative.

3274
02:23:23,660 --> 02:23:25,660
Obviously a lot of work as well.

3275
02:23:25,780 --> 02:23:27,740
And like how like they comp...

3276
02:23:27,740 --> 02:23:29,540
Like made the composition of this.

3277
02:23:30,020 --> 02:23:30,620
Was...

3278
02:23:30,620 --> 02:23:31,160
Um...

3279
02:23:31,160 --> 02:23:32,140
Very creative.

3280
02:23:32,140 --> 02:23:33,300
The next one.

3281
02:23:34,300 --> 02:23:35,580
Similar to...

3282
02:23:36,140 --> 02:23:36,680
Um...

3283
02:23:36,680 --> 02:23:37,740
The other piece.

3284
02:23:38,260 --> 02:23:38,900
Seriously.

3285
02:23:39,180 --> 02:23:40,580
I talked about it a lot.

3286
02:23:40,620 --> 02:23:42,640
I loved the way this was composed.

3287
02:23:43,160 --> 02:23:43,780
I...

3288
02:23:43,780 --> 02:23:45,820
Just something about it.

3289
02:23:45,940 --> 02:23:46,700
The look...

3290
02:23:46,700 --> 02:23:48,300
Like the pop art for it.

3291
02:23:48,480 --> 02:23:50,940
The stylistic choice of it.

3292
02:23:51,080 --> 02:23:52,160
Was just...

3293
02:23:52,160 --> 02:23:53,320
Very...

3294
02:23:53,320 --> 02:23:54,240
Interesting.

3295
02:23:54,320 --> 02:23:54,980
In general.

3296
02:23:55,040 --> 02:23:56,000
Like very creative.

3297
02:23:56,060 --> 02:23:56,880
And I just...

3298
02:23:56,880 --> 02:23:57,920
The line work.

3299
02:23:58,080 --> 02:23:59,400
Of how they did the sit...

3300
02:23:59,400 --> 02:24:00,600
The background...

3301
02:24:00,600 --> 02:24:01,180
Like...

3302
02:24:01,180 --> 02:24:02,060
Um...

3303
02:24:02,060 --> 02:24:03,240
Elements of everything.

3304
02:24:03,380 --> 02:24:03,960
Like the moon.

3305
02:24:04,020 --> 02:24:04,580
The stars.

3306
02:24:04,740 --> 02:24:05,220
The...

3307
02:24:05,220 --> 02:24:05,800
The apartments.

3308
02:24:06,420 --> 02:24:07,000
Um...

3309
02:24:07,000 --> 02:24:08,080
Just really well done.

3310
02:24:08,240 --> 02:24:09,520
And that's why they also...

3311
02:24:09,520 --> 02:24:10,160
Uh...

3312
02:24:10,160 --> 02:24:11,500
Placed 6th to 20th.

3313
02:24:12,020 --> 02:24:12,600
Um...

3314
02:24:13,500 --> 02:24:14,280
Next one.

3315
02:24:14,520 --> 02:24:15,100
Uh...

3316
02:24:15,100 --> 02:24:15,920
Guy Keary.

3317
02:24:16,220 --> 02:24:17,700
I like the trophy.

3318
02:24:17,700 --> 02:24:19,260
The tomato and the trophy.

3319
02:24:19,480 --> 02:24:20,940
And I picked this because...

3320
02:24:20,940 --> 02:24:22,500
The perspective too.

3321
02:24:22,900 --> 02:24:24,820
Was really well done.

3322
02:24:24,980 --> 02:24:27,280
Cause your eyes are drawn to this at first.

3323
02:24:27,620 --> 02:24:29,620
And I thought it was just really well done.

3324
02:24:29,660 --> 02:24:30,500
In terms of like...

3325
02:24:30,500 --> 02:24:31,160
How...

3326
02:24:31,160 --> 02:24:32,720
They did the perspective of everything.

3327
02:24:32,940 --> 02:24:34,500
And how your eyes are drawn to tomato.

3328
02:24:34,700 --> 02:24:35,120
And you're like...

3329
02:24:35,120 --> 02:24:35,360
Wow!

3330
02:24:35,660 --> 02:24:35,860
Haha!

3331
02:24:35,960 --> 02:24:36,500
That's cute!

3332
02:24:36,840 --> 02:24:37,800
That's so cute!

3333
02:24:38,100 --> 02:24:38,800
And then you're like...

3334
02:24:38,800 --> 02:24:39,120
Wow!

3335
02:24:39,880 --> 02:24:40,400
Um...

3336
02:24:40,400 --> 02:24:41,160
And that's why...

3337
02:24:41,160 --> 02:24:42,560
They also placed 6th to 20th.

3338
02:24:43,060 --> 02:24:43,580
Um...

3339
02:24:43,580 --> 02:24:44,560
For this one...

3340
02:24:44,560 --> 02:24:46,040
I love the face.

3341
02:24:46,260 --> 02:24:47,660
From DokuroDX.

3342
02:24:48,160 --> 02:24:49,860
The face is just...

3343
02:24:49,860 --> 02:24:51,540
There's just something about...

3344
02:24:51,540 --> 02:24:53,040
The way this is drawn.

3345
02:24:53,260 --> 02:24:54,340
The face too.

3346
02:24:54,520 --> 02:24:54,800
Like...

3347
02:24:54,800 --> 02:24:55,760
It's just...

3348
02:24:55,760 --> 02:24:57,880
I know like...

3349
02:24:57,880 --> 02:24:58,180
Um...

3350
02:24:58,180 --> 02:24:59,600
I wanna say like...

3351
02:24:59,600 --> 02:25:00,060
Uh...

3352
02:25:00,620 --> 02:25:01,140
Dokuro...

3353
02:25:01,140 --> 02:25:02,100
DokuroDX...

3354
02:25:02,100 --> 02:25:02,500
Was...

3355
02:25:02,500 --> 02:25:02,960
Um...

3356
02:25:02,960 --> 02:25:04,100
Cause I had staff...

3357
02:25:04,100 --> 02:25:05,460
Give input and everything.

3358
02:25:06,060 --> 02:25:06,660
And...

3359
02:25:06,660 --> 02:25:08,180
One of the staff members...

3360
02:25:08,180 --> 02:25:09,400
Really loved...

3361
02:25:09,400 --> 02:25:09,880
How...

3362
02:25:09,880 --> 02:25:10,860
The way...

3363
02:25:10,860 --> 02:25:11,520
The head...

3364
02:25:11,520 --> 02:25:12,260
Was drawn.

3365
02:25:12,520 --> 02:25:14,660
And they actually put this in their top 5.

3366
02:25:15,020 --> 02:25:15,620
Um...

3367
02:25:15,620 --> 02:25:16,340
Because of like...

3368
02:25:16,340 --> 02:25:16,780
They were like...

3369
02:25:16,780 --> 02:25:17,320
They like...

3370
02:25:17,320 --> 02:25:18,700
Loved this part.

3371
02:25:18,840 --> 02:25:19,580
Of the drawing.

3372
02:25:19,720 --> 02:25:20,240
Like the head.

3373
02:25:20,520 --> 02:25:21,120
Um...

3374
02:25:21,120 --> 02:25:22,300
It was so difficult guys.

3375
02:25:22,400 --> 02:25:22,600
Like...

3376
02:25:22,600 --> 02:25:24,360
It was so difficult to...

3377
02:25:24,360 --> 02:25:24,760
Haha!

3378
02:25:25,060 --> 02:25:25,620
To...

3379
02:25:25,620 --> 02:25:26,380
To...

3380
02:25:26,380 --> 02:25:27,380
Um...

3381
02:25:27,380 --> 02:25:28,060
To like...

3382
02:25:28,060 --> 02:25:28,880
Figure this out.

3383
02:25:30,200 --> 02:25:30,720
Um...

3384
02:25:30,720 --> 02:25:31,300
But yeah...

3385
02:25:31,300 --> 02:25:31,620
I...

3386
02:25:31,620 --> 02:25:32,560
And then the...

3387
02:25:32,560 --> 02:25:34,580
The ghost of the dead dragoons...

3388
02:25:34,580 --> 02:25:35,460
By my side...

3389
02:25:37,400 --> 02:25:37,920
Um...

3390
02:25:39,020 --> 02:25:40,420
And then we have...

3391
02:25:40,420 --> 02:25:41,060
Rosen...

3392
02:25:41,060 --> 02:25:43,000
We all know why this one was...

3393
02:25:43,000 --> 02:25:44,120
Got made into...

3394
02:25:44,120 --> 02:25:44,600
Hahaha!

3395
02:25:47,430 --> 02:25:49,530
I feel like I don't need to explain why.

3396
02:25:49,890 --> 02:25:50,410
Like...

3397
02:25:50,410 --> 02:25:51,030
Hahaha!

3398
02:25:51,230 --> 02:25:52,330
I don't need it.

3399
02:25:52,810 --> 02:25:53,330
Hahaha!

3400
02:25:57,620 --> 02:25:59,700
I don't really need to explain why.

3401
02:25:59,840 --> 02:26:00,580
But everything is...

3402
02:26:00,580 --> 02:26:01,280
about it.

3403
02:26:01,320 --> 02:26:02,520
The reason why...

3404
02:26:03,620 --> 02:26:04,420
Um...

3405
02:26:04,420 --> 02:26:05,020
For me...

3406
02:26:05,020 --> 02:26:06,780
It wasn't placed higher...

3407
02:26:06,780 --> 02:26:07,500
Was...

3408
02:26:07,500 --> 02:26:08,680
Because I also looked into...

3409
02:26:08,680 --> 02:26:09,200
Like...

3410
02:26:09,200 --> 02:26:09,900
Uh...

3411
02:26:09,900 --> 02:26:12,140
The reason why...

3412
02:26:12,140 --> 02:26:16,180
The reason why for me...

3413
02:26:16,180 --> 02:26:18,060
It wasn't placed higher...

3414
02:26:18,060 --> 02:26:18,800
Was...

3415
02:26:18,800 --> 02:26:20,880
Because I was like...

3416
02:26:20,880 --> 02:26:21,480
Hahaha!

3417
02:26:21,940 --> 02:26:23,380
I was like...

3418
02:26:23,380 --> 02:26:25,280
I don't know...

3419
02:26:25,280 --> 02:26:25,900
Hahaha!

3420
02:26:26,700 --> 02:26:27,100
Haha!

3421
02:26:27,100 --> 02:26:27,360
Hahaha!

3422
02:26:27,640 --> 02:26:28,440
Hahaha!

3423
02:26:28,440 --> 02:26:28,460
Haha!

3424
02:26:28,460 --> 02:26:29,200
Hahaha!

3425
02:26:29,200 --> 02:26:29,320
Hahaha!

3426
02:26:29,320 --> 02:26:29,940
Haha!

3427
02:26:29,940 --> 02:26:30,560
Haha!

3428
02:26:32,620 --> 02:26:35,280
But it's a very good piece.

3429
02:26:37,100 --> 02:26:39,280
It's really well done.

3430
02:26:39,480 --> 02:26:43,160
The detail is amazing in general.

3431
02:26:50,300 --> 02:26:54,780
Alright, the next one we have...

3432
02:26:54,780 --> 02:26:56,200
I love the concept.

3433
02:26:56,280 --> 02:26:57,760
I love the maid outfit.

3434
02:26:57,760 --> 02:27:00,120
I love the fact that it was...

3435
02:27:00,700 --> 02:27:03,460
It's like my outfit turned into a maid outfit.

3436
02:27:03,660 --> 02:27:05,340
And all the dragoons are here as well.

3437
02:27:05,500 --> 02:27:06,680
I just love the creativity.

3438
02:27:06,680 --> 02:27:08,080
This is my burnt green tea.

3439
02:27:08,760 --> 02:27:09,240
Sorry.

3440
02:27:10,100 --> 02:27:11,320
Ignore the honorable mention.

3441
02:27:12,840 --> 02:27:13,740
Yeah, sorry.

3442
02:27:13,820 --> 02:27:14,600
I forgot to delete this.

3443
02:27:14,700 --> 02:27:16,060
It's not honorable mention, by the way.

3444
02:27:16,160 --> 02:27:18,280
I forgot to delete this part.

3445
02:27:18,460 --> 02:27:19,820
It's not honorable mention.

3446
02:27:19,920 --> 02:27:20,700
This guy...

3447
02:27:20,700 --> 02:27:22,520
This guy placed...

3448
02:27:23,080 --> 02:27:25,560
This guy... I know it's like...

3449
02:27:25,560 --> 02:27:27,160
Can I delete it?

3450
02:27:27,200 --> 02:27:27,740
No, I can't.

3451
02:27:27,760 --> 02:27:28,440
I can only view only.

3452
02:27:28,620 --> 02:27:30,100
Ignore the honorable mention.

3453
02:27:30,920 --> 02:27:32,000
It's actually...

3454
02:27:32,630 --> 02:27:34,140
It's actually won a prize.

3455
02:27:34,280 --> 02:27:35,420
I swapped things around.

3456
02:27:37,080 --> 02:27:38,320
It's not honorable mention.

3457
02:27:38,440 --> 02:27:39,220
It actually won.

3458
02:27:39,480 --> 02:27:41,620
It actually got 6th to 20th.

3459
02:27:43,880 --> 02:27:46,240
I just forgot to delete that part.

3460
02:27:48,340 --> 02:27:50,000
But yes, the reason I picked this...

3461
02:27:50,000 --> 02:27:53,140
I just love the outfit contest in general.

3462
02:27:54,380 --> 02:27:57,220
But yeah, this is why I picked it as...

3463
02:27:57,220 --> 02:27:59,860
Not honorable mention, but it got placed.

3464
02:28:00,660 --> 02:28:03,820
The reason why I got confused is that...

3465
02:28:03,820 --> 02:28:05,400
Yes, this isn't honorable mention.

3466
02:28:05,520 --> 02:28:09,240
It's because they had two pieces of our...

3467
02:28:09,240 --> 02:28:12,120
I really liked both their entries.

3468
02:28:12,140 --> 02:28:13,480
And I had to pick one.

3469
02:28:13,620 --> 02:28:16,100
And I picked out of these two...

3470
02:28:16,100 --> 02:28:17,840
I picked this one to be placed.

3471
02:28:18,200 --> 02:28:19,840
I love the face.

3472
02:28:20,020 --> 02:28:25,080
There's just something about the way the face is drawn...

3473
02:28:25,080 --> 02:28:27,080
That was very appealing to me.

3474
02:28:27,300 --> 02:28:30,820
And then you guys have your Naruto headband too.

3475
02:28:31,140 --> 02:28:35,520
And I just love the way the face and the head was drawn in general.

3476
02:28:35,800 --> 02:28:37,660
And that's why this one got placed.

3477
02:28:37,820 --> 02:28:39,100
And I had to choose between these two.

3478
02:28:39,380 --> 02:28:40,920
The reason why was that...

3479
02:28:40,920 --> 02:28:41,900
This is honorable mention.

3480
02:28:42,040 --> 02:28:47,540
I accidentally put two of her piece artwork into prize in 6th to 20th.

3481
02:28:47,580 --> 02:28:50,020
So I had to remove...

3482
02:28:50,020 --> 02:28:50,960
I had to like...

3483
02:28:50,960 --> 02:28:52,260
Oh, that's an oversight.

3484
02:28:52,600 --> 02:28:53,640
So that's why...

3485
02:28:53,640 --> 02:28:55,680
This used to be an honorable mention.

3486
02:28:55,780 --> 02:28:59,760
I moved her burnt green tea up into placements.

3487
02:28:59,980 --> 02:29:01,760
And put this in an honorable mention.

3488
02:29:01,980 --> 02:29:03,200
Because I got confused.

3489
02:29:07,640 --> 02:29:11,300
Anyway, next up is...

3490
02:29:12,680 --> 02:29:14,340
Oh my god, they're so...

3491
02:29:14,340 --> 02:29:15,440
Oh my god, it's gonna be...

3492
02:29:15,440 --> 02:29:17,320
I know, all of them are just really pretty.

3493
02:29:18,480 --> 02:29:22,080
It's S2 Nani07262.

3494
02:29:22,080 --> 02:29:23,880
This one also placed.

3495
02:29:24,180 --> 02:29:26,340
I love the composition.

3496
02:29:26,660 --> 02:29:27,280
I love like...

3497
02:29:27,280 --> 02:29:29,480
The background of it is so creative.

3498
02:29:29,640 --> 02:29:30,200
With the...

3499
02:29:30,200 --> 02:29:32,420
I assume this is like GamerSub Liquid.

3500
02:29:33,060 --> 02:29:33,960
With like...

3501
02:29:33,960 --> 02:29:35,920
Shaped like the dragoons and the tomato.

3502
02:29:36,160 --> 02:29:37,240
It's just very pretty.

3503
02:29:37,320 --> 02:29:40,060
It looks like a manga panel as well.

3504
02:29:40,640 --> 02:29:41,240
It...

3505
02:29:41,240 --> 02:29:42,960
Yeah, it looks like a manga panel.

3506
02:29:43,160 --> 02:29:43,740
And...

3507
02:29:43,740 --> 02:29:46,200
It just looks amazing in general.

3508
02:29:47,320 --> 02:29:49,160
Next one is...

3509
02:29:49,160 --> 02:29:50,280
KG Hazard.

3510
02:29:50,900 --> 02:29:51,500
Dartstyle.

3511
02:29:51,500 --> 02:29:53,060
Really sold me on this.

3512
02:29:53,620 --> 02:29:55,640
The fact that it was like...

3513
02:29:55,640 --> 02:29:57,220
A very unique art style.

3514
02:29:57,600 --> 02:29:59,160
Compared to like...

3515
02:29:59,880 --> 02:30:02,000
The other artwork.

3516
02:30:03,100 --> 02:30:03,560
So...

3517
02:30:05,620 --> 02:30:06,540
It was...

3518
02:30:08,040 --> 02:30:08,960
Very difficult.

3519
02:30:09,700 --> 02:30:11,300
It was very difficult to...

3520
02:30:11,300 --> 02:30:12,820
Oh my gosh, like I said, it was very difficult to pick.

3521
02:30:12,940 --> 02:30:15,360
But the art style really made it popped out a lot more.

3522
02:30:15,660 --> 02:30:17,440
And I really love...

3523
02:30:17,440 --> 02:30:18,240
It's just so creative.

3524
02:30:18,320 --> 02:30:19,340
I just love this art style.

3525
02:30:19,620 --> 02:30:21,320
Like it just brings me back to like...

3526
02:30:21,500 --> 02:30:22,060
The retro days.

3527
02:30:22,520 --> 02:30:23,760
For Retro Doki.

3528
02:30:27,060 --> 02:30:28,200
When do we...

3529
02:30:28,200 --> 02:30:28,900
When is it...

3530
02:30:28,900 --> 02:30:29,660
I need to count.

3531
02:30:29,880 --> 02:30:30,340
Are we at...

3532
02:30:30,340 --> 02:30:31,180
Okay.

3533
02:30:31,580 --> 02:30:33,280
I need to make sure like...

3534
02:30:33,280 --> 02:30:34,040
When we're...

3535
02:30:34,040 --> 02:30:35,380
Okay, let's see.

3536
02:30:36,620 --> 02:30:37,140
One...

3537
02:30:38,300 --> 02:30:38,820
One...

3538
02:30:39,600 --> 02:30:40,120
Two...

3539
02:30:41,060 --> 02:30:41,580
Three...

3540
02:30:41,580 --> 02:30:42,400
Two...

3541
02:30:43,020 --> 02:30:43,540
Three...

3542
02:30:44,700 --> 02:30:45,220
Four...

3543
02:30:46,820 --> 02:30:47,340
Five...

3544
02:30:48,420 --> 02:30:48,940
Six...

3545
02:30:48,940 --> 02:30:50,080
Okay, we're almost there.

3546
02:30:50,220 --> 02:30:51,100
Okay, I was counting.

3547
02:30:55,680 --> 02:30:56,160
Defeating...

3548
02:30:57,860 --> 02:30:58,340
Defeating...

3549
02:30:58,340 --> 02:30:59,020
Defeating...

3550
02:30:59,020 --> 02:30:59,380
Defeating...

3551
02:30:59,380 --> 02:30:59,940
Yeah, guys.

3552
02:30:59,940 --> 02:31:00,000
Four...

3553
02:31:00,000 --> 02:31:00,620
And now one.

3554
02:31:00,620 --> 02:31:00,640
Yeah.

3555
02:31:00,640 --> 02:31:00,880
I think there was about...

3556
02:31:00,880 --> 02:31:02,500
That was all about this sort of Morro-j repairs...

3557
02:31:02,500 --> 02:31:02,840
And now about this...

3558
02:31:02,840 --> 02:31:04,700
But it goes into the next question.

3559
02:31:04,780 --> 02:31:04,920
Any other questions?

3560
02:31:06,500 --> 02:31:06,980
And...

3561
02:31:11,420 --> 02:31:12,420
De경 says, Okay, so...

3562
02:31:16,540 --> 02:31:18,080
We do encourage religious continuous appeasing, there's something you want.

3563
02:31:19,840 --> 02:31:21,420
If you are a BLM fan.

3564
02:31:22,720 --> 02:31:25,000
And the composition with the background.

3565
02:31:25,180 --> 02:31:26,100
I love the attitude.

3566
02:31:26,480 --> 02:31:30,040
And that's why this one was also picked into it.

3567
02:31:30,120 --> 02:31:33,440
It was just... it just looks like I'm the fucking boss.

3568
02:31:33,880 --> 02:31:36,880
It looks like I'm the fucking boss lady.

3569
02:31:37,320 --> 02:31:39,240
So it got there.

3570
02:31:41,660 --> 02:31:42,720
Another one.

3571
02:31:42,900 --> 02:31:50,140
I love the creativity.

3572
02:31:51,480 --> 02:31:55,480
As if I was on a playing card.

3573
02:31:55,940 --> 02:31:58,400
I liked how it looked like I was on a playing card.

3574
02:31:58,640 --> 02:32:01,520
And the way it's drawn and everything, the style-wise.

3575
02:32:01,800 --> 02:32:04,160
And how I'm getting out of the box too.

3576
02:32:04,500 --> 02:32:06,880
And that's why I picked this for the placements.

3577
02:32:06,960 --> 02:32:11,180
I'm going fast for this because I already explained why I really like each artwork individually.

3578
02:32:11,740 --> 02:32:14,500
So I'm just explaining why I picked it in general.

3579
02:32:14,900 --> 02:32:17,580
I'm explaining why I picked it.

3580
02:32:18,300 --> 02:32:21,400
You can tell that I picked a lot of different styles going in.

3581
02:32:21,480 --> 02:32:23,840
Because I really want to diversify...

3582
02:32:23,840 --> 02:32:24,980
Yeah, it looks like a tarot card.

3583
02:32:25,080 --> 02:32:28,760
I want to diversify the styles.

3584
02:32:29,100 --> 02:32:35,260
So each different style has its own placement in here.

3585
02:32:36,940 --> 02:32:40,140
And then the background was what sold me for this.

3586
02:32:40,580 --> 02:32:41,800
It was just so creative.

3587
02:32:41,960 --> 02:32:44,440
I love the background of how this was drawn.

3588
02:32:44,580 --> 02:32:46,260
I love how clean this is.

3589
02:32:46,420 --> 02:32:47,820
And that's why I picked it up here.

3590
02:32:47,960 --> 02:32:50,220
Because the background was just so fucking clean.

3591
02:32:51,480 --> 02:32:52,780
It's just so creative.

3592
02:32:52,860 --> 02:32:54,780
Like the star at the end.

3593
02:32:55,120 --> 02:32:55,920
Oh my god.

3594
02:32:56,060 --> 02:32:57,160
I was just wow.

3595
02:32:58,740 --> 02:33:00,640
I think this is the last...

3596
02:33:01,460 --> 02:33:02,140
6th...

3597
02:33:02,140 --> 02:33:03,620
The 20th thing.

3598
02:33:05,000 --> 02:33:07,980
So the Seppa Kanken.

3599
02:33:10,420 --> 02:33:11,780
The composition.

3600
02:33:11,860 --> 02:33:12,600
The pose.

3601
02:33:13,320 --> 02:33:15,980
The way the trophy was drawn.

3602
02:33:16,300 --> 02:33:17,920
And the stars too.

3603
02:33:18,300 --> 02:33:19,980
And that's why I picked this one.

3604
02:33:19,980 --> 02:33:21,820
For the finalists.

3605
02:33:21,940 --> 02:33:23,180
So it's just...

3606
02:33:23,180 --> 02:33:25,380
Everything about it was just really well done.

3607
02:33:25,820 --> 02:33:28,180
And finally, we are at...

3608
02:33:28,180 --> 02:33:29,720
I think 5th place.

3609
02:33:30,900 --> 02:33:32,260
4th to 5th.

3610
02:33:32,540 --> 02:33:34,660
When I saw this on Twitter...

3611
02:33:34,660 --> 02:33:37,020
I loved this drawing.

3612
02:33:40,940 --> 02:33:42,720
When I saw...

3613
02:33:42,720 --> 02:33:44,280
I remember when I saw this on Twitter.

3614
02:33:44,460 --> 02:33:45,140
I actually...

3615
02:33:45,140 --> 02:33:46,300
I love this drawing.

3616
02:33:46,380 --> 02:33:49,840
I just love the idea of it too.

3617
02:33:49,840 --> 02:33:51,500
So this is now...

3618
02:33:51,500 --> 02:33:53,020
We're at top 5.

3619
02:33:53,720 --> 02:33:55,800
We are at top 5.

3620
02:33:56,180 --> 02:33:58,140
So I was...

3621
02:33:58,640 --> 02:34:02,400
I really liked how fun it is.

3622
02:34:02,600 --> 02:34:04,540
Like how creative this is.

3623
02:34:04,640 --> 02:34:06,640
And how fun the drawing is.

3624
02:34:06,740 --> 02:34:08,860
And it just felt like it fit my personality.

3625
02:34:09,460 --> 02:34:14,920
So that is why I picked this in the top 5.

3626
02:34:16,360 --> 02:34:18,880
This artist had like...

3627
02:34:18,880 --> 02:34:22,060
2 artworks that were really good.

3628
02:34:22,340 --> 02:34:23,900
And so it was very hard to pick.

3629
02:34:24,260 --> 02:34:24,880
Because...

3630
02:34:26,600 --> 02:34:29,240
Well they had 3 entries.

3631
02:34:29,620 --> 02:34:31,840
And it was really hard to pick one of them.

3632
02:34:32,160 --> 02:34:32,740
So...

3633
02:34:32,740 --> 02:34:35,380
This is by GrimSilvers.

3634
02:34:35,880 --> 02:34:37,180
The details.

3635
02:34:37,520 --> 02:34:40,320
The details is beautiful.

3636
02:34:40,360 --> 02:34:41,820
I love the shading.

3637
02:34:41,960 --> 02:34:42,600
The details.

3638
02:34:42,680 --> 02:34:45,220
The choice of what to make that's transparent.

3639
02:34:45,800 --> 02:34:46,420
And...

3640
02:34:46,420 --> 02:34:48,720
And that's why I picked this drawing.

3641
02:34:48,880 --> 02:34:53,240
The other artwork they did was for the other guys who are very enthusiastic.

3642
02:34:58,100 --> 02:35:00,240
This is an honorable mention.

3643
02:35:01,160 --> 02:35:03,900
Because their other artwork was also really good.

3644
02:35:04,000 --> 02:35:07,400
The details of everything was also really good.

3645
02:35:07,680 --> 02:35:08,040
So...

3646
02:35:08,040 --> 02:35:09,160
But yes.

3647
02:35:10,100 --> 02:35:12,760
This GrimSilvers got 4th to 5th.

3648
02:35:14,780 --> 02:35:17,060
I'm trying to remember what the prize money was again.

3649
02:35:17,120 --> 02:35:17,860
I know I said it.

3650
02:35:17,860 --> 02:35:19,640
So for those who don't know.

3651
02:35:19,720 --> 02:35:21,320
4th to 5th gets $250.

3652
02:35:21,620 --> 02:35:23,540
6th to 20th gets $100.

3653
02:35:23,980 --> 02:35:25,480
3rd gets $500.

3654
02:35:26,000 --> 02:35:27,900
2nd gets $1000.

3655
02:35:28,040 --> 02:35:32,600
And the 2 winners get $2500 each.

3656
02:35:33,400 --> 02:35:35,620
So just a reminder for everybody.

3657
02:35:36,440 --> 02:35:37,940
And I believe...

3658
02:35:38,940 --> 02:35:43,000
2nd to 5th will be made into a sticker pack.

3659
02:35:44,300 --> 02:35:45,140
So...

3660
02:35:45,140 --> 02:35:48,180
This and this will be stickers.

3661
02:35:48,360 --> 02:35:52,080
If you buy the bundle, you'll get stickers with these designs.

3662
02:35:53,420 --> 02:35:54,180
Anyway.

3663
02:35:55,540 --> 02:35:56,300
3rd.

3664
02:35:58,460 --> 02:35:59,980
3rd is...

3665
02:35:59,980 --> 02:36:02,880
I picked Fluffy Catfish.

3666
02:36:03,300 --> 02:36:07,380
I thought the idea was so creative.

3667
02:36:07,560 --> 02:36:10,900
It looks like I'm on a drink brand.

3668
02:36:11,220 --> 02:36:11,620
You know?

3669
02:36:11,640 --> 02:36:12,940
Like a drink advertisement.

3670
02:36:12,940 --> 02:36:17,180
It looked like I was on these classy drink advertisements.

3671
02:36:17,660 --> 02:36:21,900
And I thought that this idea was so creative.

3672
02:36:21,940 --> 02:36:24,580
And the little dokey bird at the end there.

3673
02:36:24,840 --> 02:36:26,040
At the bottom.

3674
02:36:26,100 --> 02:36:27,940
And I just realized that...

3675
02:36:28,620 --> 02:36:29,940
This is like...

3676
02:36:29,940 --> 02:36:34,780
You know like a classy margarita type deal.

3677
02:36:34,800 --> 02:36:35,340
Like a cocktail.

3678
02:36:35,700 --> 02:36:39,260
It looks like I'm on a cocktail drink advertisement at a club.

3679
02:36:39,500 --> 02:36:40,540
Like a fancy club.

3680
02:36:40,540 --> 02:36:41,360
Like those...

3681
02:36:41,360 --> 02:36:45,440
Like the 1940's clubs and stuff.

3682
02:36:47,360 --> 02:36:51,500
So I thought this was very creative in the way it was done.

3683
02:36:52,800 --> 02:36:54,460
Like a dokey teeny.

3684
02:36:54,680 --> 02:36:54,840
Yeah!

3685
02:36:55,860 --> 02:36:59,920
And that's why I picked it as 3rd place.

3686
02:37:00,360 --> 02:37:00,920
Alright.

3687
02:37:01,000 --> 02:37:04,040
Now we're on to the two 2nd placements.

3688
02:37:06,100 --> 02:37:09,120
Seishi is our first 2nd place winner.

3689
02:37:10,540 --> 02:37:15,220
I just thought overall everything was very well done.

3690
02:37:15,440 --> 02:37:20,880
I really liked the entire composition in general.

3691
02:37:21,140 --> 02:37:25,820
And I love just how everything was drawn.

3692
02:37:26,040 --> 02:37:29,300
Like the background, the pose, the shading.

3693
02:37:29,400 --> 02:37:30,040
It's so clean.

3694
02:37:30,240 --> 02:37:32,660
It was very clean and very like...

3695
02:37:32,660 --> 02:37:36,440
It just worked really well in general.

3696
02:37:36,560 --> 02:37:38,440
Like everything coming together.

3697
02:37:38,520 --> 02:37:39,560
And that's why...

3698
02:37:39,560 --> 02:37:42,700
This is our first 2nd place winner.

3699
02:37:42,960 --> 02:37:45,560
And then our other 2nd place winner was...

3700
02:37:46,980 --> 02:37:47,900
Wiro.

3701
02:37:49,700 --> 02:37:55,740
My personality was showing so well in this drawing.

3702
02:37:57,140 --> 02:38:03,160
I thought it reflected the personality very very well.

3703
02:38:03,460 --> 02:38:08,960
And the fact that it was able to portray...

3704
02:38:08,960 --> 02:38:13,880
I just thought it did so well in terms of just portraying who I am.

3705
02:38:14,280 --> 02:38:15,620
Who I am.

3706
02:38:15,840 --> 02:38:19,800
What I put out as a brand.

3707
02:38:20,120 --> 02:38:24,880
And that is why I picked this one as the 2nd place winner.

3708
02:38:27,040 --> 02:38:27,680
So...

3709
02:38:28,800 --> 02:38:34,260
It was very difficult to pick one 1st place winner.

3710
02:38:34,700 --> 02:38:38,420
And GamerSupps was...

3711
02:38:38,420 --> 02:38:39,540
Oh, by the way.

3712
02:38:39,580 --> 02:38:41,300
I just realized it's not even $8000.

3713
02:38:41,600 --> 02:38:42,400
It's more than that.

3714
02:38:42,460 --> 02:38:43,440
It's a little bit more than that.

3715
02:38:43,780 --> 02:38:44,280
Because...

3716
02:38:44,840 --> 02:38:47,600
I just realized the math ain't right.

3717
02:38:47,820 --> 02:38:49,420
It's actually more than $8000.

3718
02:38:49,680 --> 02:38:50,680
I think it's like...

3719
02:38:50,680 --> 02:38:52,360
Because I ended up...

3720
02:38:52,360 --> 02:38:53,820
I think it's $8500.

3721
02:38:55,220 --> 02:38:56,060
I think.

3722
02:38:56,500 --> 02:38:59,200
Because I ended up picking 2...

3723
02:38:59,920 --> 02:39:01,140
2 1st place winners.

3724
02:39:01,240 --> 02:39:02,900
Instead of 3 2nd place winners.

3725
02:39:03,240 --> 02:39:06,040
Because originally it was going to be 3 2nd place winners.

3726
02:39:06,380 --> 02:39:07,440
Instead of...

3727
02:39:09,120 --> 02:39:11,460
Instead of 2 2nd place winners.

3728
02:39:11,720 --> 02:39:12,160
So...

3729
02:39:12,900 --> 02:39:14,340
I ended up picking...

3730
02:39:16,280 --> 02:39:17,540
2 1st place winners.

3731
02:39:17,660 --> 02:39:20,900
And GamerSupps is paying for all this prize money, by the way.

3732
02:39:21,020 --> 02:39:24,560
They are paying for all of the prize money.

3733
02:39:25,140 --> 02:39:25,580
And...

3734
02:39:25,580 --> 02:39:26,520
Sorry, $9500.

3735
02:39:26,820 --> 02:39:27,420
Okay, I'll edit.

3736
02:39:27,580 --> 02:39:28,120
Okay, guys.

3737
02:39:28,180 --> 02:39:29,360
I'll edit that right now.

3738
02:39:29,420 --> 02:39:29,980
Oh my god.

3739
02:39:33,240 --> 02:39:33,680
Okay.

3740
02:39:34,240 --> 02:39:34,920
Okay, fine.

3741
02:39:35,080 --> 02:39:36,800
I'll edit that right now.

3742
02:39:38,140 --> 02:39:38,620
Damn!

3743
02:39:46,360 --> 02:39:46,840
And...

3744
02:39:51,380 --> 02:39:54,100
So, I asked them if it was possible.

3745
02:39:54,380 --> 02:39:55,400
And they were like...

3746
02:39:55,400 --> 02:39:56,380
They were like...

3747
02:39:56,380 --> 02:39:56,720
Yes.

3748
02:39:56,820 --> 02:39:57,800
Yeah, we can do that.

3749
02:39:57,880 --> 02:39:58,740
We can have...

3750
02:39:58,740 --> 02:40:00,160
We can pay off...

3751
02:40:00,160 --> 02:40:00,940
We can give...

3752
02:40:00,940 --> 02:40:02,680
We can have 2 first place winners.

3753
02:40:02,720 --> 02:40:03,760
Because it was very difficult.

3754
02:40:04,200 --> 02:40:06,320
Picking the last 2.

3755
02:40:06,320 --> 02:40:16,900
So, the first one I'm gonna show that got first place, they actually had, they submitted multiple entries, so it was very difficult because I really like both of their entries.

3756
02:40:17,200 --> 02:40:23,460
So, I'll show their honorable mention, so you might remember, you might remember their artwork.

3757
02:40:23,740 --> 02:40:27,180
So, their honorable mention, which I had to pick between the two.

3758
02:40:27,300 --> 02:40:27,760
Drumroll please.

3759
02:40:33,680 --> 02:40:36,920
This is an honorable mention, this is by the same artist.

3760
02:40:37,680 --> 02:40:48,600
It was very difficult picking between the one that did win, versus this one, because I loved the stickers, I felt like it looked so good on the cup.

3761
02:40:48,860 --> 02:40:57,120
Because like, it's not printed that big in general, so I felt like the face was very well done.

3762
02:40:57,880 --> 02:41:07,080
And I felt like it really, like it has like, you know, it has Alt Doki and Alternative Doki, which a lot of people love Alternative Doki.

3763
02:41:07,340 --> 02:41:11,180
And the trophy wise with the little stickers on there.

3764
02:41:11,620 --> 02:41:23,480
But, so the one I did pick, the one I did pick was, if you guys don't remember who it was, like their other artwork, was this one.

3765
02:41:24,620 --> 02:41:27,740
So, the reason why I picked this one was...

3766
02:41:27,760 --> 02:41:30,780
Okay, the one thing, I love that it says Doki Bird.

3767
02:41:31,760 --> 02:41:34,380
Some people were like, who's this waifu cup?

3768
02:41:34,640 --> 02:41:36,500
And then they'll be like, oh it's Doki Bird.

3769
02:41:37,460 --> 02:41:39,780
But it's not just that, it's not just that.

3770
02:41:39,840 --> 02:41:50,020
Anyway, I love, like I love the concept, like it's just, I felt like this fits a lot of like, the personality.

3771
02:41:50,500 --> 02:41:55,560
It's not because of the, it was, I'm joking guys, it's not because of the text.

3772
02:41:55,940 --> 02:41:56,420
Like...

3773
02:41:57,760 --> 02:41:58,460
I'm joking.

3774
02:41:58,660 --> 02:42:02,200
It's not because of the text, the reason why I picked this.

3775
02:42:02,380 --> 02:42:04,140
I'm joking guys.

3776
02:42:04,460 --> 02:42:08,940
I thought this drawing in general, I thought...

3777
02:42:09,760 --> 02:42:13,060
It's not because of name dropping.

3778
02:42:16,860 --> 02:42:22,260
It's also because I thought it fit my personality really well.

3779
02:42:22,440 --> 02:42:25,820
It's very clean, like it's very clean.

3780
02:42:26,080 --> 02:42:26,760
Um...

3781
02:42:26,760 --> 02:42:28,700
I love the way they did the background.

3782
02:42:28,780 --> 02:42:31,700
You can see like the smoke coming out behind me if you look closer.

3783
02:42:31,840 --> 02:42:35,360
And the trophy, with the GamerSup logo on the trophy.

3784
02:42:35,500 --> 02:42:36,600
And then like the little sparkle.

3785
02:42:36,900 --> 02:42:38,680
And then there's also like...

3786
02:42:38,680 --> 02:42:39,360
Um...

3787
02:42:39,360 --> 02:42:42,060
The fact that the tomato's face...

3788
02:42:42,060 --> 02:42:42,640
Like...

3789
02:42:43,300 --> 02:42:45,760
The tomato face there is...

3790
02:42:45,760 --> 02:42:46,840
I love...

3791
02:42:46,840 --> 02:42:47,460
I love...

3792
02:42:47,460 --> 02:42:49,240
But I felt like overall...

3793
02:42:49,240 --> 02:42:51,820
The overallness of everything...

3794
02:42:51,820 --> 02:42:54,120
It was just like...

3795
02:42:54,120 --> 02:42:56,520
It was just very Doki Bird.

3796
02:42:56,520 --> 02:42:57,320
Um...

3797
02:42:57,320 --> 02:42:59,240
It was incredibly Doki Bird.

3798
02:42:59,360 --> 02:43:03,700
And like branding-wise, personality, it just really fit me and everything.

3799
02:43:04,460 --> 02:43:04,980
Um...

3800
02:43:05,540 --> 02:43:10,060
And that's why like I picked this as one of the first place winners.

3801
02:43:11,160 --> 02:43:11,680
Now...

3802
02:43:12,460 --> 02:43:14,640
The other first place winner...

3803
02:43:14,640 --> 02:43:15,720
Alright, drumroll please.

3804
02:43:16,060 --> 02:43:17,820
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba...

3805
02:43:17,820 --> 02:43:18,680
Drumroll!

3806
02:43:18,880 --> 02:43:21,700
The other first place winner...

3807
02:43:21,700 --> 02:43:23,940
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba...

3808
02:43:24,840 --> 02:43:25,360
Is...

3809
02:43:26,440 --> 02:43:27,100
Meiju...

3810
02:43:27,100 --> 02:43:27,660
Uh...

3811
02:43:27,660 --> 02:43:28,960
J-U-W...

3812
02:43:28,960 --> 02:43:29,600
I'm so sorry.

3813
02:43:29,880 --> 02:43:30,540
Meiju...

3814
02:43:31,360 --> 02:43:32,080
I think.

3815
02:43:32,560 --> 02:43:33,220
I...

3816
02:43:33,220 --> 02:43:34,640
It's beaut...

3817
02:43:34,640 --> 02:43:35,860
It's a beautiful artwork.

3818
02:43:36,220 --> 02:43:36,540
Like...

3819
02:43:39,120 --> 02:43:39,780
Um...

3820
02:43:40,360 --> 02:43:41,600
Really like...

3821
02:43:41,600 --> 02:43:45,300
I think like this is incredibly well drawn.

3822
02:43:45,580 --> 02:43:46,940
It's very beautiful.

3823
02:43:47,460 --> 02:43:48,120
Um...

3824
02:43:48,120 --> 02:43:50,180
I thought like it's also a different style.

3825
02:43:50,480 --> 02:43:53,820
It's a different style from the other side.

3826
02:43:53,920 --> 02:43:54,240
So...

3827
02:43:54,240 --> 02:43:56,860
What is gonna happen is that the waifu cup...

3828
02:43:57,640 --> 02:44:00,340
The front and the back will be different.

3829
02:44:00,560 --> 02:44:04,300
So one side will be the other drawing and the other side will be this one.

3830
02:44:04,540 --> 02:44:05,020
So...

3831
02:44:05,020 --> 02:44:05,900
That is what...

3832
02:44:05,900 --> 02:44:07,680
So you can have the best of both worlds.

3833
02:44:08,320 --> 02:44:08,800
Um...

3834
02:44:08,800 --> 02:44:10,860
So it's gonna be on the same cup together.

3835
02:44:11,220 --> 02:44:14,500
And I like that it's also like a different style too.

3836
02:44:14,680 --> 02:44:15,900
It's very like different style.

3837
02:44:16,060 --> 02:44:18,320
It's beautifully drawn and everything.

3838
02:44:18,700 --> 02:44:19,520
And like...

3839
02:44:19,520 --> 02:44:19,880
You know...

3840
02:44:19,880 --> 02:44:20,500
There's like...

3841
02:44:20,500 --> 02:44:21,400
There's me also here.

3842
02:44:21,480 --> 02:44:22,600
I love the little bites.

3843
02:44:22,600 --> 02:44:23,300
Also like...

3844
02:44:23,300 --> 02:44:24,520
The little bites really help.

3845
02:44:26,660 --> 02:44:27,820
Just like...

3846
02:44:27,820 --> 02:44:30,440
The tiny ass fucking face.

3847
02:44:30,600 --> 02:44:31,340
You know I have that?

3848
02:44:31,520 --> 02:44:31,920
Wait...

3849
02:44:31,920 --> 02:44:33,320
I actually...

3850
02:44:33,320 --> 02:44:35,840
I never showed you guys this.

3851
02:44:35,880 --> 02:44:36,180
Like...

3852
02:44:36,180 --> 02:44:36,940
Give me a sec.

3853
02:44:37,080 --> 02:44:39,800
I actually realized I never showed you guys.

3854
02:44:40,540 --> 02:44:42,000
Give me a sec.

3855
02:44:42,380 --> 02:44:43,800
Oh my god.

3856
02:44:44,040 --> 02:44:46,200
I never showed you guys...

3857
02:44:46,200 --> 02:44:49,660
What I can do.

3858
02:44:50,000 --> 02:44:51,060
Give me a sec.

3859
02:44:54,400 --> 02:44:54,880
Um...

3860
02:44:54,880 --> 02:44:55,580
Let me see.

3861
02:44:55,640 --> 02:44:56,340
Where is it?

3862
02:44:56,580 --> 02:44:57,520
I haven't...

3863
02:44:57,520 --> 02:44:58,480
We haven't...

3864
02:44:59,260 --> 02:44:59,740
Um...

3865
02:44:59,740 --> 02:45:00,620
We haven't...

3866
02:45:01,400 --> 02:45:01,880
Um...

3867
02:45:01,880 --> 02:45:03,860
We haven't done this in a while.

3868
02:45:04,000 --> 02:45:04,360
Oh my god.

3869
02:45:04,400 --> 02:45:05,020
Where is it?

3870
02:45:06,020 --> 02:45:07,100
Where is it?

3871
02:45:07,120 --> 02:45:07,800
Oh no.

3872
02:45:08,140 --> 02:45:09,340
Which one is it?

3873
02:45:11,960 --> 02:45:13,260
What was the...

3874
02:45:13,260 --> 02:45:15,020
What was the trigger?

3875
02:45:15,240 --> 02:45:15,800
I don't...

3876
02:45:15,800 --> 02:45:17,020
I don't remember.

3877
02:45:17,420 --> 02:45:17,900
No.

3878
02:45:20,080 --> 02:45:21,480
I'm trying to remember how to...

3879
02:45:22,100 --> 02:45:22,580
I'm trying to remember how to...

3880
02:45:22,580 --> 02:45:23,620
I'm sorry, give me a sec.

3881
02:45:23,860 --> 02:45:24,960
I know I'm sorry.

3882
02:45:25,120 --> 02:45:26,520
I need to show you this.

3883
02:45:26,600 --> 02:45:27,640
It's so important.

3884
02:45:28,280 --> 02:45:33,940
It's actually so important, but I don't... I will remember.

3885
02:45:34,380 --> 02:45:37,140
Guys, I will remember this.

3886
02:45:37,460 --> 02:45:39,600
It's very... oh my god.

3887
02:45:40,520 --> 02:45:41,700
Where is it?

3888
02:45:41,860 --> 02:45:43,100
There's no way.

3889
02:45:43,820 --> 02:45:45,200
Did I?

3890
02:45:45,400 --> 02:45:48,700
Guys, I think I accidentally deleted it.

3891
02:45:48,700 --> 02:45:48,980
No!

3892
02:45:49,840 --> 02:45:50,380
No!

3893
02:45:51,830 --> 02:45:53,670
It was so funny!

3894
02:45:54,330 --> 02:45:57,670
I must have accidentally deleted it!

3895
02:45:58,070 --> 02:45:59,750
I'm so sad!

3896
02:46:02,940 --> 02:46:03,800
Wait, no.

3897
02:46:03,860 --> 02:46:05,780
Wait, let me see if I can find it.

3898
02:46:05,820 --> 02:46:09,400
Guys, let me see if I can find it.

3899
02:46:10,280 --> 02:46:11,180
Is it this?

3900
02:46:13,180 --> 02:46:14,200
Is it this one?

3901
02:46:14,460 --> 02:46:15,460
Guys, give me a sec.

3902
02:46:15,500 --> 02:46:17,840
I know you guys are like, what's going on?

3903
02:46:20,960 --> 02:46:21,500
No!

3904
02:46:24,180 --> 02:46:24,780
No!

3905
02:46:27,490 --> 02:46:29,670
I don't know what it was called.

3906
02:46:29,830 --> 02:46:30,570
You don't understand.

3907
02:46:31,030 --> 02:46:33,890
I actually don't remember what it was called.

3908
02:46:35,850 --> 02:46:37,430
Guys, guys, no.

3909
02:46:37,650 --> 02:46:41,730
I swear it's gonna be so worth it when I find it.

3910
02:46:41,870 --> 02:46:43,530
Guys, I swear to god.

3911
02:46:44,230 --> 02:46:48,930
Guys, it's gonna be so worth it the moment I find this.

3912
02:46:50,050 --> 02:46:51,950
It's so worth it.

3913
02:46:52,090 --> 02:46:55,690
I just need to figure out... oh, is it this?

3914
02:46:57,490 --> 02:46:59,270
Wait, I think it is.

3915
02:47:02,390 --> 02:47:03,090
It's okay.

3916
02:47:03,330 --> 02:47:03,810
Okay.

3917
02:47:10,840 --> 02:47:14,050
I found it.

3918
02:47:14,170 --> 02:47:15,530
I found it.

3919
02:47:18,100 --> 02:47:20,920
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

3920
02:47:21,000 --> 02:47:22,980
Do you realize I never showed you guys this?

3921
02:47:23,260 --> 02:47:23,740
Okay.

3922
02:47:26,860 --> 02:47:29,260
Okay, wait, give me a sec.

3923
02:47:29,620 --> 02:47:30,600
I should not...

3924
02:47:30,600 --> 02:47:31,040
be there.

3925
02:47:34,040 --> 02:47:34,520
Okay.

3926
02:47:35,160 --> 02:47:36,680
Okay, guys, guys, guys.

3927
02:47:40,560 --> 02:47:41,040
Guys.

3928
02:47:41,040 --> 02:47:42,020
Oh, guys.

3929
02:47:42,500 --> 02:47:43,760
Okay, this is very important.

3930
02:47:44,020 --> 02:47:44,780
Watch this.

3931
02:47:45,560 --> 02:47:46,560
Watch this, guys.

3932
02:47:57,040 --> 02:48:00,620
I forgot to show... I realized I never showed you guys this one.

3933
02:48:02,760 --> 02:48:03,500
Hey, guys.

3934
02:48:06,700 --> 02:48:09,720
I was not being porn dead.

3935
02:48:09,720 --> 02:48:09,840
Oh my god.

3936
02:48:09,840 --> 02:48:10,120
That's not me.

3937
02:48:10,120 --> 02:48:10,120
That was so funny to watch.

3938
02:48:10,120 --> 02:48:11,660
That's what reminded me of.

3939
02:48:11,780 --> 02:48:14,200
Think this is somebody's ears.

3940
02:48:15,320 --> 02:48:16,020
I wasn't.

3941
02:48:16,020 --> 02:48:16,260
So yeah.

3942
02:48:16,320 --> 02:48:22,160
That's why I also, I really liked that like it's real.

3943
02:48:22,200 --> 02:48:23,300
Come on man.

3944
02:48:23,300 --> 02:48:23,440
Like it's real.

3945
02:48:23,440 --> 02:48:28,360
I love the tomato and the artwork was like the faces like this.

3946
02:48:28,560 --> 02:48:30,840
I was so funny.

3947
02:48:30,960 --> 02:48:35,300
I told you.

3948
02:48:35,300 --> 02:48:35,780
I told you.

3949
02:48:35,800 --> 02:48:36,580
I told you it was worth it!

3950
02:48:36,920 --> 02:48:38,180
I told you!

3951
02:48:38,620 --> 02:48:41,640
I told you it was so worth it, guys!

3952
02:48:42,120 --> 02:48:43,260
I told you!

3953
02:48:43,280 --> 02:48:45,500
You must be like, please, Doki, anytime.

3954
02:48:45,800 --> 02:48:48,220
I told you it was so worth it!

3955
02:48:48,300 --> 02:48:51,140
The way it was worth it, chat, is...

3956
02:48:53,100 --> 02:48:55,240
Yeah, I can turn it off, see?

3957
02:48:58,740 --> 02:49:01,460
Anyway, let me go back into my skin, see?

3958
02:49:01,520 --> 02:49:03,860
I gotta pilot my mech real fast.

3959
02:49:03,860 --> 02:49:04,820
Let me...

3960
02:49:07,560 --> 02:49:09,280
Let me get back in.

3961
02:49:09,380 --> 02:49:11,640
Let me get back into the mech.

3962
02:49:14,560 --> 02:49:15,200
Anyway...

3963
02:49:15,860 --> 02:49:19,780
So yeah, that's what I wanted to show you guys.

3964
02:49:19,980 --> 02:49:23,480
That's what I wanted to show you guys.

3965
02:49:28,020 --> 02:49:30,660
But yes, these are...

3966
02:49:31,820 --> 02:49:33,140
These are the...

3967
02:49:33,860 --> 02:49:34,360
Winners.

3968
02:49:35,100 --> 02:49:38,560
The first... The first place winners, these two.

3969
02:49:38,760 --> 02:49:43,880
I figured they both will look amazing on the waifu cup.

3970
02:49:44,160 --> 02:49:45,780
But now, for those who are wondering...

3971
02:49:46,640 --> 02:49:49,920
When will we get the waifu cup?

3972
02:49:50,840 --> 02:49:53,360
Pre-orders, I believe.

3973
02:49:53,440 --> 02:49:55,860
This is a rough estimate, by the way, guys.

3974
02:49:55,940 --> 02:49:57,580
This is a rough estimate.

3975
02:49:58,160 --> 02:49:58,760
But...

3976
02:50:00,100 --> 02:50:02,220
We are looking at November.

3977
02:50:02,220 --> 02:50:04,060
For the pre-orders.

3978
02:50:05,000 --> 02:50:07,440
Pre-orders will include...

3979
02:50:08,460 --> 02:50:10,900
In November will be when we're...

3980
02:50:10,900 --> 02:50:12,280
Pre-orders will be ready.

3981
02:50:12,980 --> 02:50:14,700
And it will include...

3982
02:50:16,060 --> 02:50:17,760
The waifu cup.

3983
02:50:19,080 --> 02:50:22,220
The waifu cup t-shirts designs.

3984
02:50:22,920 --> 02:50:26,780
You can get these designs as t-shirts, basically.

3985
02:50:27,180 --> 02:50:28,480
So, like, individual.

3986
02:50:29,080 --> 02:50:31,300
So they will be as t-shirts.

3987
02:50:31,300 --> 02:50:37,780
And also, I believe, second to fifth place winners will be a sticker bundle.

3988
02:50:38,040 --> 02:50:39,780
If you buy the bundle...

3989
02:50:40,880 --> 02:50:43,040
If you buy the whole bundle...

3990
02:50:43,040 --> 02:50:45,700
You will get them...

3991
02:50:45,700 --> 02:50:52,680
You will be receiving stickers of the second to fifth place winners.

3992
02:50:53,280 --> 02:50:54,140
So, yeah!

3993
02:50:54,240 --> 02:50:57,480
That's basically all the details regarding...

3994
02:50:57,480 --> 02:50:58,280
Um...

3995
02:50:59,020 --> 02:50:59,580
Regarding...

3996
02:50:59,580 --> 02:51:00,080
Um...

3997
02:51:00,080 --> 02:51:00,420
The...

3998
02:51:00,420 --> 02:51:00,960
The...

3999
02:51:00,960 --> 02:51:02,300
The gamer sub stuff.

4000
02:51:02,640 --> 02:51:03,360
The waifu cup.

4001
02:51:04,100 --> 02:51:04,660
Wow!

4002
02:51:05,480 --> 02:51:07,440
It took a very long time to judge this.

4003
02:51:07,460 --> 02:51:09,160
I'm so happy this is finally...

4004
02:51:09,160 --> 02:51:11,780
I don't have to deal with judging...

4005
02:51:11,780 --> 02:51:12,180
Do...

4006
02:51:12,180 --> 02:51:13,500
Like, doing more judging anymore.

4007
02:51:14,420 --> 02:51:16,020
It was so difficult!

4008
02:51:16,440 --> 02:51:17,340
It was...

4009
02:51:17,340 --> 02:51:20,140
It was so difficult to judge!

4010
02:51:20,280 --> 02:51:21,520
I'm so happy!

4011
02:51:21,620 --> 02:51:24,000
Like, we finally figured it out!

4012
02:51:24,300 --> 02:51:24,860
Hahaha!

4013
02:51:26,340 --> 02:51:28,100
And I hope you guys...

4014
02:51:28,660 --> 02:51:29,180
Um...

4015
02:51:29,180 --> 02:51:30,700
I hope you guys...

4016
02:51:30,700 --> 02:51:31,420
Um...

4017
02:51:32,100 --> 02:51:34,620
Like the artworks I picked...

4018
02:51:34,620 --> 02:51:35,360
Um...

4019
02:51:35,360 --> 02:51:38,220
For the waifu cup and the finalists too.

4020
02:51:38,380 --> 02:51:39,540
I hope you guys...

4021
02:51:39,540 --> 02:51:42,780
You guys agree with me regarding the finalists.

4022
02:51:42,860 --> 02:51:44,180
It was so difficult.

4023
02:51:44,300 --> 02:51:46,120
I'm sorry you didn't make it to the...

4024
02:51:46,120 --> 02:51:47,220
As the finalists.

4025
02:51:47,340 --> 02:51:49,120
I just want you guys to know, like...

4026
02:51:49,120 --> 02:51:51,620
It was very, very, very difficult.

4027
02:51:51,780 --> 02:51:54,740
It took me five months to reach this...

4028
02:51:54,740 --> 02:51:55,700
This decision.

4029
02:51:55,860 --> 02:51:56,520
Hahaha!

4030
02:51:56,880 --> 02:51:58,260
It took me so long!

4031
02:51:58,720 --> 02:51:59,220
Um...

4032
02:51:59,220 --> 02:52:01,860
But let's congratulate all the winners.

4033
02:52:03,040 --> 02:52:05,160
Let's congratulate all the winners.

4034
02:52:05,500 --> 02:52:07,080
And all the participants.

4035
02:52:07,540 --> 02:52:11,820

If I could, I would pick more.

Yeah!

4124
02:54:52,380 --> 02:54:55,880
Yeah, it was... it was a lot of talking.

4125
02:54:56,140 --> 02:54:58,000
Definitely next week I'm going to talk a lot less.

4126
02:54:58,580 --> 02:55:06,640
As in like, I'm going to do... I'm going to like... have like a curfew when it comes to my streams for next week.

4127
02:55:06,660 --> 02:55:07,860
Because I need to rest my voice.

4128
02:55:08,500 --> 02:55:10,560
My voice is slowly dying today.

4129
02:55:14,280 --> 02:55:20,900
My slow voice is slowly dying, so I definitely need to rest my vocal cords for next week.

4130
02:55:24,520 --> 02:55:25,940
What do I want to say?

4131
02:55:26,560 --> 02:55:33,600
But yeah, I am... I am...

4132
02:55:33,600 --> 02:55:39,600
Well, it's just nice to have another thing done, you know, off the to-do list.

4133
02:55:40,260 --> 02:55:42,780
Obviously, I have so much stuff on my to-do list.

4134
02:55:42,940 --> 02:55:48,860
But it's nice that... that it's nice that... to have another thing being like, Check!

4135
02:55:49,080 --> 02:55:49,760
I did it!

4136
02:55:49,820 --> 02:55:51,300
I made progress in life!

4137
02:55:51,300 --> 02:55:56,480
Another thing to check off the list that I owe... that I had to do!

4138
02:55:57,240 --> 02:55:59,180
Yeah, one less thing in the backlog.

4139
02:55:59,560 --> 02:56:03,260
I'm so happy to finally be able to announce the winners.

4140
02:56:03,740 --> 02:56:10,660
And like... and being able to like, progress in life in terms of like, my to-do list and everything.

4141
02:56:10,980 --> 02:56:15,200
And being able to showcase so many wonderful, talented artists and individuals today.

4142
02:56:16,480 --> 02:56:20,620
Yeah, it's been... it's definitely worth it.

4143
02:56:20,700 --> 02:56:21,280
I'm so happy.

4144
02:56:21,940 --> 02:56:22,740
To showcase.

4145
02:56:22,840 --> 02:56:23,540
I love art.

4146
02:56:23,740 --> 02:56:27,040
I love being able to showcase all like, such talented people.

4147
02:56:27,360 --> 02:56:29,480
So it was such a joy to do.

4148
02:56:31,620 --> 02:56:32,220
Let's see.

4149
02:56:33,120 --> 02:56:34,480

4150
02:56:34,560 --> 02:56:35,200
Thank you, thank you!

4151
02:56:35,220 --> 02:56:37,900
Thank you for making time to show the final pics.

4152
02:56:38,140 --> 02:56:39,200
Feels like everyone won!

4153
02:56:39,360 --> 02:56:40,200
Thank you for the super chat!

4154
02:56:40,300 --> 02:56:41,120
Thank you, thank you!

4155
02:56:41,720 --> 02:56:43,540
I really... I really appreciate it!

4156
02:56:43,620 --> 02:56:44,460
Thank you so much!

4157
02:56:46,440 --> 02:56:48,800
Oh my god, I'm so tired.

4158
02:56:50,220 --> 02:56:54,680
I'm looking forward to seeing... seeing how it looks like though.

4159
02:56:54,760 --> 02:56:56,820
When it... when the samples come in.

4160
02:56:57,060 --> 02:57:00,220
I'm super excited to see what the samples will look like.

4161
02:57:00,220 --> 02:57:04,980
And how... just to have... like, be able to see it IRL.

4162
02:57:05,260 --> 02:57:08,260
You know, and see the... like, what it looks like printed on the cup.

4163
02:57:08,420 --> 02:57:09,500
And the t-shirts too.

4164
02:57:09,920 --> 02:57:11,440
And I get to get it for free.

4165
02:57:12,340 --> 02:57:13,900
Because it's my brand.

4166
02:57:16,620 --> 02:57:18,400
I love free stuff.

4167
02:57:18,400 --> 02:57:18,800
I love...

4168
02:57:21,040 --> 02:57:21,700
Yay!

4169
02:57:22,000 --> 02:57:23,440
Free t-shirt!

4170
02:57:24,540 --> 02:57:25,200
Yay!

4171
02:57:25,500 --> 02:57:27,500
I don't need to buy clothes!

4172
02:57:32,260 --> 02:57:34,880
I don't need to buy clothes!

4173
02:57:36,150 --> 02:57:36,480
Yay!

4174
02:57:39,840 --> 02:57:44,960
I would never wear it in public.

4175
02:57:45,200 --> 02:57:45,680
I feel...

4176
02:57:46,400 --> 02:57:47,440
If anything...

4177
02:57:47,440 --> 02:57:48,980
If I wear that shit in public...

4178
02:57:48,980 --> 02:57:50,120
They'll be like...

4179
02:57:50,120 --> 02:57:50,880
Hmm...

4180
02:57:51,200 --> 02:57:52,840
Why do you sound like her?

4181
02:57:53,240 --> 02:57:53,800
And why...

4182
02:57:53,800 --> 02:57:54,840
It's gonna be pajamas.

4183
02:57:55,200 --> 02:57:55,380
Yay!

4184
02:57:55,520 --> 02:57:56,300
Free pajamas!

4185
02:57:58,340 --> 02:57:58,860
Yay!

4186
02:58:00,880 --> 02:58:01,800
It'll be...

4187
02:58:01,800 --> 02:58:02,740
It'll be...

4188
02:58:02,740 --> 02:58:03,740
Free pajamas!

4189
02:58:04,540 --> 02:58:05,200
Let's go!

4190
02:58:11,060 --> 02:58:12,380
Oh yeah, story time.

4191
02:58:12,980 --> 02:58:14,360
It's about dad again.

4192
02:58:14,460 --> 02:58:15,340
It's always about him.

4193
02:58:15,400 --> 02:58:16,980
He always fucking does a new thing.

4194
02:58:17,440 --> 02:58:19,200
This isn't a story I told in members.

4195
02:58:19,340 --> 02:58:20,140
But it's a different story.

4196
02:58:20,220 --> 02:58:21,500
Because something new happened yesterday.

4197
02:58:21,840 --> 02:58:24,140
I took him for a walk yesterday.

4198
02:58:24,560 --> 02:58:26,800
We bumped into this lady with two dogs.

4199
02:58:27,080 --> 02:58:29,180
And he wouldn't leave her alone.

4200
02:58:29,640 --> 02:58:31,360
What do you mean by he wouldn't leave her alone?

4201
02:58:31,640 --> 02:58:33,360
He was in love with her.

4202
02:58:34,120 --> 02:58:36,200
Just because she pet...

4203
02:58:36,200 --> 02:58:37,320
She petted him.

4204
02:58:37,600 --> 02:58:39,100
And you know what was so fucked?

4205
02:58:39,400 --> 02:58:40,200
She was like...

4206
02:58:40,200 --> 02:58:42,640
Wouldn't it be funny if I took the leash...

4207
02:58:42,640 --> 02:58:44,940
If I took the leash and just walked away with him?

4208
02:58:45,000 --> 02:58:46,040
Do you think he'll follow me?

4209
02:58:46,040 --> 02:58:47,040
And I'll be like...

4210
02:58:47,040 --> 02:58:48,400
And she's like...

4211
02:58:48,400 --> 02:58:48,860
Can I try?

4212
02:58:49,180 --> 02:58:50,600
So then I gave her the leash.

4213
02:58:50,740 --> 02:58:51,200
And then...

4214
02:58:51,200 --> 02:58:53,460
And then dad just ran off with her.

4215
02:58:54,140 --> 02:58:54,740
Like...

4216
02:58:55,820 --> 02:58:56,840
To the...

4217
02:58:56,840 --> 02:58:59,820
To a different direction that was not towards home.

4218
02:59:04,400 --> 02:59:06,240
And then I was like...

4219
02:59:06,240 --> 02:59:07,160
What the fuck?

4220
02:59:09,480 --> 02:59:11,340
Bro, he ain't loyal.

4221
02:59:12,000 --> 02:59:12,600
Bro!

4222
02:59:12,820 --> 02:59:16,570
He literally walked in a different direction.

4223
02:59:16,590 --> 02:59:18,030
That was not my usual...

4224
02:59:18,030 --> 02:59:19,430
Our usual path by the way.

4225
02:59:19,430 --> 02:59:20,690
And like...

4226
02:59:20,690 --> 02:59:21,670
Like with her.

4227
02:59:21,790 --> 02:59:23,550
And then she like brought him back.

4228
02:59:23,650 --> 02:59:24,310
It was like...

4229
02:59:24,310 --> 02:59:24,730
Oh, wait.

4230
02:59:24,810 --> 02:59:25,090
He...

4231
02:59:25,090 --> 02:59:26,770
He was just like...

4232
02:59:26,770 --> 02:59:28,110
Oh my god.

4233
02:59:28,290 --> 02:59:30,150
He really just loves me.

4234
02:59:30,430 --> 02:59:31,630
And I'm just like...

4235
02:59:31,630 --> 02:59:32,210
Yeah.

4236
02:59:33,510 --> 02:59:34,030
Tears.

4237
02:59:35,010 --> 02:59:36,690
And then I was like...

4238
02:59:36,690 --> 02:59:37,290
Alright, dad.

4239
02:59:37,430 --> 02:59:37,770
Come on.

4240
02:59:37,830 --> 02:59:38,270
We gotta go.

4241
02:59:38,510 --> 02:59:39,330
Come on.

4242
02:59:39,370 --> 02:59:41,290
We gotta go home now.

4243
02:59:41,410 --> 02:59:42,370
We have to head home.

4244
02:59:42,750 --> 02:59:43,730
And then...

4245
02:59:43,730 --> 02:59:44,890
He started crying.

4246
02:59:45,750 --> 02:59:46,230
He like...

4247
02:59:46,230 --> 02:59:46,870
He was like...

4248
02:59:47,690 --> 02:59:48,210
Like...

4249
02:59:48,210 --> 02:59:48,310
Like...

4250
02:59:48,310 --> 02:59:48,410
Like...

4251
02:59:48,410 --> 02:59:48,530
Like...

4252
02:59:48,530 --> 02:59:48,730
Like...

4253
02:59:48,730 --> 02:59:48,850
Like...

4254
02:59:48,850 --> 02:59:49,250
At the..

4255
02:59:49,250 --> 02:59:49,930
At the other lady.

4256
02:59:50,210 --> 02:59:51,050
He's like...

4257
02:59:51,990 --> 02:59:52,590
No...

4258
02:59:56,660 --> 02:59:57,260
So...

4259
02:59:57,260 --> 02:59:59,840
like he wouldn't move.

4260
03:00:00,040 --> 03:00:01,120
He was just looking at...

4261
03:00:01,120 --> 03:00:01,340
He was like...

4262
03:00:01,340 --> 03:00:03,060
But I want to go with her.

4263
03:00:03,220 --> 03:00:03,540
I was like...

4264
03:00:03,540 --> 03:00:05,020
You just met her!

4265
03:00:05,480 --> 03:00:08,040
He started whimpering and everything.

4266
03:00:08,840 --> 03:00:09,940
And then...

4267
03:00:11,160 --> 03:00:12,500
And then like...

4268
03:00:12,500 --> 03:00:13,920
And then I was like...

4269
03:00:13,920 --> 03:00:16,280
I gave you everything...

4270
03:00:16,280 --> 03:00:17,420
I gave you...

4271
03:00:17,420 --> 03:00:19,280
And then the lady was like...

4272
03:00:19,280 --> 03:00:20,800
Oh, I'll walk with you.

4273
03:00:20,920 --> 03:00:21,520
Um...

4274
03:00:21,520 --> 03:00:21,540
You already...

4275
03:00:21,540 --> 03:00:28,340
And then the moment she walked with me, he followed, like, he went right, he walked home.

4276
03:00:32,400 --> 03:00:39,060
The moment, the moment he fucking walked with, she walked with me, he was like, yay!

4277
03:00:42,200 --> 03:00:42,720
Yay!

4278
03:00:42,720 --> 03:00:47,960
And then we got to the door of my apartment, like, the door of the lobby of my apartment building.

4279
03:00:48,280 --> 03:00:50,900
And she's like, I gotta go now, miss you.

4280
03:00:51,540 --> 03:00:52,140
Bye-bye!

4281
03:00:52,380 --> 03:00:57,620
And then, and then he, like, looked at us, like, I'm like, what?

4282
03:00:58,580 --> 03:01:01,180
And then I was like, I was like, come on!

4283
03:01:01,420 --> 03:01:02,460
And I, like, pulled him.

4284
03:01:02,640 --> 03:01:05,880
And then, and then the moment, like, the door opened, he was like, okay.

4285
03:01:06,140 --> 03:01:07,480
And then he walked in!

4286
03:01:08,940 --> 03:01:12,820
He, like, it's the moment the door opened!

4287
03:01:13,160 --> 03:01:13,940
He's like, alright!

4288
03:01:14,180 --> 03:01:15,340
And he forgot about her.

4289
03:01:15,600 --> 03:01:16,720
And he's like, home time!

4290
03:01:17,280 --> 03:01:17,680
Yay!

4291
03:01:18,260 --> 03:01:19,540
Time to go home!

4292
03:01:21,820 --> 03:01:25,720
And then he just walks ahead of me, and I was like, yay!

4293
03:01:25,940 --> 03:01:27,220
Time to go home!

4294
03:01:29,480 --> 03:01:35,950
I was just, I don't know, I even, I don't know what's wrong with everything!

4295
03:01:36,670 --> 03:01:41,670
I don't, just because this lady just started petting him, he was like, yay!

4296
03:01:42,590 --> 03:01:44,250
I'm gonna go home with her!

4297
03:01:44,830 --> 03:01:45,390
Yay!

4298
03:01:49,290 --> 03:01:52,750
I even bought him a new bed yesterday!

4299
03:01:53,870 --> 03:01:59,970
I was like, here's a more comfy bed for you, cause I love you!

4300
03:02:00,370 --> 03:02:06,050
And this bitch tried to fucking rock, run away with the other lady, I can't believe it!

4301
03:02:06,170 --> 03:02:17,710
I can't, I can't believe he tried to, or he actually was like, I gave the leash to the lady and he actually walked away from me!

4302
03:02:17,950 --> 03:02:22,270
Like, he's, he's, yes, he's using it!

4303
03:02:22,350 --> 03:02:23,850
He's literally sleeping in it right now!

4304
03:02:23,870 --> 03:02:28,250
Like, did you pet him?

4305
03:02:28,430 --> 03:02:30,190
Yes, I'm always petting him!

4306
03:02:33,390 --> 03:02:35,250
Oh my god!

4307
03:02:35,570 --> 03:02:39,730
Oh my god!

4308
03:02:40,070 --> 03:02:41,830
Like, I don't understand!

4309
03:02:43,590 --> 03:02:47,370
I love him though, even though he breaks my heart like that!

4310
03:02:47,570 --> 03:02:50,510
Like, he just likes new smells!

4311
03:02:50,690 --> 03:02:53,050
I think he also smelled the treats on her!

4312
03:02:53,870 --> 03:02:59,210
The lady was like, oh yeah, like, I had lots of treats on me, but like, I don't have any right now!

4313
03:02:59,410 --> 03:03:04,590
Cause like, she has two dogs, she was like, walking two dogs, and she's like, oh, you must smell the treats on me!

4314
03:03:04,770 --> 03:03:07,030
I'm sorry, I don't have treats right now!

4315
03:03:07,570 --> 03:03:08,510
Maybe next time!

4316
03:03:08,570 --> 03:03:11,010
Like, she was like, saying that to my dog, maybe next time!

4317
03:03:11,210 --> 03:03:19,930
So I think he, like, smelled, like, treats, like, food on her, and he got, like, extra excited too, and was like, I'm going with her, she has more food!

4318
03:03:20,150 --> 03:03:23,850
And I'm like, I'm like, bro, okay, like, there was another...

4319
03:03:23,870 --> 03:03:27,730
pet owner next to us, and she was like, wow, your dog is so muscular.

4320
03:03:28,070 --> 03:03:29,590
And I was like, he is?

4321
03:03:29,870 --> 03:03:35,190
Like, they're like, wow, your dog is so muscular!

4322
03:03:35,210 --> 03:03:36,430
And I'm like, what?

4323
03:03:37,570 --> 03:03:39,010
I don't notice that!

4324
03:03:39,150 --> 03:03:39,770
I was like, really?

4325
03:03:42,950 --> 03:03:47,330
Yeah, my, apparently, apparently, dad's muscular!

4326
03:03:47,350 --> 03:03:48,690
I don't even notice!

4327
03:03:49,170 --> 03:03:50,070
I don't...

4328
03:03:51,970 --> 03:03:52,930
And then...

4329
03:03:52,930 --> 03:03:53,670
And then...

4330
03:03:57,070 --> 03:03:59,410
He's very food-motivated, by the way.

4331
03:03:59,450 --> 03:04:01,510
He's very food-motivated.

4332
03:04:02,950 --> 03:04:05,330
I'm pretty sure it's because he smelled treats on her.

4333
03:04:05,510 --> 03:04:09,070
He was like, she has treats and you don't give me treats sometimes.

4334
03:04:09,450 --> 03:04:13,990
I'm like, I don't want to overfeed you.

4335
03:04:14,210 --> 03:04:15,970
You're just a wiener dog.

4336
03:04:16,090 --> 03:04:17,730
You're long, but you're short.

4337
03:04:18,230 --> 03:04:21,030
A fat wiener dog is bad for the back.

4338
03:04:21,090 --> 03:04:22,710
I don't want to overfeed you.

4339
03:04:22,710 --> 03:04:26,230
Like, I don't want to fuck up your back.

4340
03:04:26,830 --> 03:04:33,130
It's not good for you to have more meat on you.

4341
03:04:37,390 --> 03:04:39,750
Maybe you paid attention to his games.

4342
03:04:39,910 --> 03:04:41,530
There'd be less MTR.

4343
03:04:41,850 --> 03:04:43,630
Mercy, thank you for the super chat.

4344
03:04:43,790 --> 03:04:45,030
Thank you, thank you.

4345
03:04:49,410 --> 03:04:52,150
Oh my god, feed me, mother.

4346
03:04:52,230 --> 03:04:52,690
I feed you.

4347
03:04:52,710 --> 03:04:54,190
I feed him, like, so much.

4348
03:04:54,350 --> 03:04:55,670
But not too much.

4349
03:04:55,770 --> 03:04:58,090
Not too much that he's, like, overweight.

4350
03:04:58,510 --> 03:05:00,950
I feed him at a right amount.

4351
03:05:01,730 --> 03:05:07,050
I feed him a right amount of food.

4352
03:05:08,090 --> 03:05:10,890
But yeah, that's my dad.

4353
03:05:11,210 --> 03:05:13,850
The fact that he almost actually ran off with her.

4354
03:05:13,950 --> 03:05:15,430
Like, no hesitation, too.

4355
03:05:15,490 --> 03:05:18,510
The moment I gave the leash to the lady, he was ready.

4356
03:05:18,770 --> 03:05:20,030
He was so fucking ready.

4357
03:05:20,030 --> 03:05:24,220
He was so fucking...

4358
03:05:29,840 --> 03:05:35,540
He was waiting for this moment.

4359
03:05:36,780 --> 03:05:40,920
I need that protein, baby.

4360
03:05:44,160 --> 03:05:45,520
Okay.

4361
03:05:45,860 --> 03:05:47,940
But yeah, that's my...

4362
03:05:47,940 --> 03:05:51,020
That is my...

4363
03:05:51,020 --> 03:05:51,760
That is my...

4364
03:05:51,760 --> 03:05:53,060
That's my dad's story of the day.

4365
03:05:53,200 --> 03:05:56,360
That is my dad's story of the day, guys.

4366
03:05:59,840 --> 03:06:02,560
But anyway, I'm gonna call it here, everybody.

4367
03:06:03,180 --> 03:06:04,060
I'm tired.

4368
03:06:05,440 --> 03:06:06,660
I'm tired.

4369
03:06:07,160 --> 03:06:13,280
But as always, everybody, stay hydrated, posture check, get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

4370
03:06:13,360 --> 03:06:17,260
And if you stay up for me, head to bed, because you deserve it.

4371
03:06:17,520 --> 03:06:18,700
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

4372
03:06:19,420 --> 03:06:20,320
Bye, guys.

4373
03:06:20,920 --> 03:06:21,400
Bye!

4374
03:06:21,760 --> 03:06:23,540
