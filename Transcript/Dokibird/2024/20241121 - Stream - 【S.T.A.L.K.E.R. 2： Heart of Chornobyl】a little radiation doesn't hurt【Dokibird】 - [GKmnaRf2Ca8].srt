1
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:33,000
Oh, sorry.

2
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:34,580
No more loops, by the way.

3
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,660
I'm compiling shaders right now.

4
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:48,440
I'm compiling shaders at the moment in the background.

5
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:49,840
Sorry.

6
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:54,600
Okay, so the reason why we had so many loops is that I forgot how to stream.

7
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,920
I was like, I should get some water.

8
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:01,280
And I was like, ooh, I'm a little thirsty.

9
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:09,420
And then I was like, ooh, I should close my 200 tabs that I have open.

10
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:15,060
I had like 70 tabs opened on my, you know, since I haven't streamed in a while.

11
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:20,160
I had like 70 plus tabs opened on my PC.

12
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:22,560
So I was like, I should clean that up.

13
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:26,220
While I was like, the waiting room, the intro was going on.

14
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:29,020
And I was just like, I should close some of these.

15
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:33,860
I was like, oh, yeah.

16
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,120
I'm pretty sure, like, I just read the reviews.

17
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:40,460
And like, there was a performance issues with soccer.

18
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:43,040
He had a little performance anxiety.

19
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:45,660
So I was like, ooh, I should.

20
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,920
Oh, yeah, sorry.

21
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:51,580
I should get that fixed.

22
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:55,700
I should make sure my PC is not, you know, on fire or anything.

23
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:58,700
So I'm compiling shaders right now in the background.

24
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:03,140
So, yeah, apparently they already put our patch right now for it.

25
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:05,400
Give me a second, I need to sneeze real quick.

26
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:06,360
Oh, God.

27
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:08,460
Oh, no, come on.

28
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,000
Give me that sneeze.

29
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:10,700
No!

30
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,360
Okay, I had like, you'll want to sneeze, but you can't issue.

31
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,840
So, it's been a while, guys.

32
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,920
It's been a while.

33
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:20,260
I'm sorry.

34
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,440
It has been, I know.

35
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:26,400
A lot has been going.

36
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:29,940
I was not feeling great when I came back.

37
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:33,060
Because, you know, I got sick.

38
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,480
And I really hate taking breaks.

39
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,780
I really do.

40
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,680
And like, you know, I didn't put any schedule up.

41
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,020
And then I sort of like, I was like, all right.

42
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,960
For those who don't follow me on Twitter.

43
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,200
Because like, you know, I don't blame you.

44
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,460
You know, I don't blame you.

45
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,420
And I don't have blue skies.

46
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:52,840
Or anything.

47
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,940
The newest social media platform.

48
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,480
I barely could use Twitter alone.

49
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:59,060
Let alone like, another one.

50
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,720
And I know some of you guys don't use Twitter.

51
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,580
So you're like, we have a stream today?

52
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,220
Yes, yesterday I was like, yeah, stalker stream.

53
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,100
And then I was like, oh shit.

54
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,320
Okay, I should make a waiting room for that.

55
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:13,260
But the reason why I didn't have the waiting room early.

56
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:18,620
Was because if you aren't using 50 plus tabs, you aren't doing it.

57
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,240
Exactly.

58
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,080
Shaded Heart, thank you for the super chat.

59
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,020
Thank you, thank you.

60
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:27,660
So the reason why we didn't have the waiting room earlier.

61
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:31,080
Was because this stream, I'm sorry.

62
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:35,000
The shaders is like, it's still compiled.

63
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,720
I'll show you guys what we're looking at right now.

64
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:39,620
Because it's still compiling.

65
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,160
If I'm like, if I'm like, 5 FPS right now.

66
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:47,260
It's compiling shaders.

67
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,520
Compiling is real.

68
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:57,740
Anyway, so the reason why it took so long to make my waiting room.

69
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:59,820
You know, I could have made the waiting room yesterday.

70
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:06,020
Was because, oh my god.

71
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,340
I hate this.

72
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,180
It's like killing me.

73
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:14,220
Seeing myself at like 5 FPS right now is fucking killing me.

74
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:19,500
Was because, today we're sponsored.

75
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,660
Weird, sorry.

76
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:25,680
By the way, I was really tired.

77
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:29,340
Because I went to bed at like 6 in the morning today.

78
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,200
And I went to bed yesterday at 6 in the morning.

79
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:38,560
So that's why I took a 40 minute nap.

80
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:41,700
I took a 40 minute nap before the stream was starting.

81
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:46,900
And because of that, I literally woke up 10 minutes before the stream was supposed to start.

82
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,660
Oh my god, thank god.

83
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:52,780
I'm sorry, I'm trying to remember how to stream.

84
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:57,200
No, no, no, it's not because of Overwatch, guys.

85
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:59,760
Guys, you can't always blame Overwatch.

86
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,260
Sometimes it's just not Overwatch, guys.

87
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:05,220
Sometimes, I know it's crazy to think about.

88
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:09,240
But sometimes, it's not just about Overwatch.

89
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,120
There are other things, okay?

90
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:15,720
There are other things this time.

91
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,600
It's not just Overwatch.

92
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,600
There are other issues.

93
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,820
But anyway, anyway.

94
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,400
I had a lot of work stuff to catch up on.

95
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:33,360
So that's why there's no schedule at the moment.

96
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:35,980
Because I was sick, I was sick.

97
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,840
And I have a lot of work stuff.

98
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,740
And I have a sponsor today.

99
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:47,680
So, obviously, I couldn't be like, no stream.

100
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,420
Because I signed a contract.

101
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,660
Anton, thank you for the super chat.

102
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:55,880
Thank you, thank you.

103
00:10:58,220 --> 00:10:59,760
Nino, thank you for the super chat.

104
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:00,840
Thank you, thank you.

105
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:01,840
Yesterday was my birthday.

106
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:04,580
Gonna try and buy new PC parts to fit the higher case.

107
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,680
I'm excited to watch the console next month.

108
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,560
Oh my god, I'm so happy.

109
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:09,660
You got so much stuff.

110
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:13,100
There's more stuff that just came out.

111
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:14,820
Nino, lucky for you.

112
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:17,920
There's more things that just came out.

113
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,640
Sorry, there's a lot of things.

114
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:21,020
There's a lot of things.

115
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,920
But happy birthday to you.

116
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:24,740
Happy birthday to you.

117
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:26,560
Happy birthday dear Nino.

118
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,440
Happy birthday to you.

119
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,040
Yeah!

120
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,560
So today, we are sponsored by MSI.

121
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:37,700
Yes, MSI.

122
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:44,960
The PC slash monitor slash a lot of PC related company.

123
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:51,160
They sponsored me today to play Stalker during launch day.

124
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:57,160
So they graciously provided us a couple of Stalker codes.

125
00:11:57,540 --> 00:12:04,440
So I will be giving out key codes, game codes for Stalker 2 at the end of the stream.

126
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,480
So you guys can redeem it.

127
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,460
It is very limited.

128
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,760
I think there's like five codes.

129
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:15,360
So five lucky dragoons would be able to receive a Stalker 2 for free.

130
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:23,020
And basically, it is in regards to the promotion of their new monitor.

131
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:33,400
So if you purchase their monitor and watch a trailer, you can redeem Stalker 2 along with a free copy of Stalker 2.

132
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:38,720
Plus $30 for your Steam wallet if you purchase one of their monitors.

133
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:42,240
So it's like a special promotion with the game on launch.

134
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:46,520
You know, it's great because I was going to play Stalker 2 anyway.

135
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,880
But now I get paid to play Stalker 2.

136
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:49,480
So...

137
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:57,620
And so, it's like, you know, it all worked out in the end.

138
00:12:57,780 --> 00:13:00,820
Because I was originally thinking of playing Stalker 2 on launch.

139
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:04,320
But now I'm sponsored to play Stalker 2 on launch.

140
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,540
So it works out.

141
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,680
I mean, to be fair, I would like...

142
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:11,860
I'm not like alive at the moment.

143
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,460
I'm still like fucked up right now like health-wise.

144
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:21,240
So like, it got so bad in the beginning when I first came back.

145
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:24,980
Because I think I overdid it during the rush stream.

146
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,640
Because I was like, you know, I was like forcing myself to stream the last two days.

147
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:34,420
Because like, I felt really bad that I wasn't able to stream the rush drops as much as I would have liked.

148
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:40,220
At the end of the last day of the rush stream, I was coughing a lot.

149
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:45,980
So to the point where like, I think at night, I like actually like got to the point where I coughed myself.

150
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,540
Like to the point where I threw up because I was coughing so much.

151
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:52,900
So I was like, okay, I really, I should take a break.

152
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:55,620
I really hate taking breaks.

153
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:58,420
And I really hate it because I was gone for so long.

154
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:01,180
I was already gone for so long.

155
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:02,400
And I was like, ah!

156
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:04,840
But like, I needed to.

157
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,780
I still haven't gone to the doctors, guys.

158
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:08,560
I know.

159
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,160
No, you don't understand.

160
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:11,900
You don't understand.

161
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:15,400
I have a good excuse as to why I haven't gone to the doctors.

162
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:20,540
It's because if you're Canadian and you don't have a private doctor.

163
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:27,400
And you don't have like a private doctor, like a consistent doctor where you're like a return patient.

164
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:35,580
It is very, very hard to find a doctor that would take new patients.

165
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:37,780
It is incredibly difficult.

166
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:48,020
And even if they do, you have to wait at least like a couple of weeks to get an appointment.

167
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:58,990
So, so I was like, I called, I called like two to three doctors.

168
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:03,510
And they're like, we won't be able to see you until like maybe two to three weeks.

169
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:05,790
And I was like, I might as well like.

170
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:11,350
No, they're not walk-ins.

171
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:12,850
That's the thing.

172
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:19,230
The walk-ins are either incredibly limited or they don't provide, they don't provide walk-ins near me.

173
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:22,070
It's like a lot, they don't provide walk-ins near me.

174
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:27,690
So, so it's just like, I was just like, well, I might be better by then.

175
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:28,590
I don't fucking know.

176
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:37,290
You guys are like, well, but you guys have free health care.

177
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:38,830
Yeah, free health.

178
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:41,410
Okay, I was talking to like one of my friends about it.

179
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:49,030
I was talking to one of my friends about it because like she was also having coughing issues.

180
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:52,570
And I was like, I was like, yeah, I got it too.

181
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:54,830
I have like really bad coughing now.

182
00:15:54,830 --> 00:16:05,470
And then we're talking about like, you know, like finding private doctors here, like filing family doctors or like private doctors here is so fucking hard.

183
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:07,570
Because like, you know, they norm.

184
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:12,490
It takes so long to actually like want to see like they'll take new patients or anything.

185
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:18,490
And then they're like, we're like, oh, yeah, like I had like an issue with something.

186
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:24,810
And I just and then she was like, I decided to try out like, you know, she was like, I decided to try out.

187
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:29,470
Like the free free health care part of the free health care.

188
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:31,750
And then she was like, yeah.

189
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:33,030
And then I waited.

190
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:36,250
I waited like two months.

191
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:42,690
And then when I finally got there, the doctor was like, oh, this is not like you need to go to a different doctor.

192
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:44,870
This is not like my specialty.

193
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:47,150
Like what you have right now is not my specialty.

194
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:48,910
So you got to go to a different doctor.

195
00:16:49,210 --> 00:16:51,610
And then she was like, why the fuck?

196
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:58,590
Why did I wait two months?

197
00:16:58,590 --> 00:16:58,750
Why did I wait two months?

198
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:05,320
Yeah.

199
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:06,320
Yeah.

200
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:08,580
So that's like you guys.

201
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:17,300
I think, wow, Canada, you have free health care, but by free, you gotta wait a long time to be able to access the free part.

202
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:23,160
It's not like it's not like you you get it right away.

203
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:26,900
We still gotta we still gotta wait.

204
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:29,340
We still gotta wait.

205
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:39,840
To be fair, you guys in America, you guys gotta wait two months and then pay like two thousand dollars.

206
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:43,140
So like it's a little bit better over here.

207
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:49,000
It's a little better because at least we don't have to pay for it.

208
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,220
Like we just gotta wait.

209
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:53,320
But you guys gotta wait and pay for it.

210
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:56,500
So like that's like the only thing that's like better.

211
00:17:58,140 --> 00:17:59,500
Only two thousand?

212
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:05,820
Doki, you're thinking about 2000 America, not 2024 America.

213
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:12,200
Oh my God.

214
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:18,840
But anyway, so yeah, so I haven't seen a doctor yet about it.

215
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:21,840
So that's why like this week is a little weird.

216
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:27,140
I know we have a few confirmed streams that got announced already by like others.

217
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:37,020
Tomorrow, I don't know if I'm streaming tomorrow, but Friday, Fillion invited me and Doobie to do a collab with her.

218
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:38,820
So like I'm not sure.

219
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:47,240
I don't I think it's confirmed because like I'm not sure because like when she asked when she invited me, I told her I'm sick.

220
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:53,200
I was like, she's like, do you want to play with Doobie and I?

221
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:56,140
And I was like, bro, I just threw up.

222
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:04,420
It's like she asked me on like a thing like on Sunday or Monday.

223
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:06,680
I was like, I just threw up, Fillion.

224
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:07,720
I don't know.

225
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,860
I don't know.

226
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:15,080
And she was like, oh man, like I was like, we'll see.

227
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:18,600
And I was like, the day after that, I was like, I'll let you know tomorrow.

228
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:28,920
And then like, and then I was like, and I was like, you know what?

229
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:30,500
It's Friday.

230
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:32,780
It's like a couple of days.

231
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:35,120
I have a couple of days to recover.

232
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,480
So I was like, you know what?

233
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:38,640
It's Friday.

234
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:40,600
It's Friday, Friday.

235
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:45,880
And I was just like, I think by then I'll be OK.

236
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:52,240
Like, I was like, I think I'll be OK.

237
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,560
And so, yeah.

238
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:04,500
So like, I believe Doobie's not streaming her POV because she said like, you know, she has like her whole internet thing.

239
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:06,980
Because I mean, I was like, wait, is Doobie going to be OK?

240
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,040
Because I know she has like internet issues and stuff.

241
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:12,020
And Fillion said, yeah, yeah, it should be fine.

242
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:15,860
And Doobie was like, yeah, most likely if it gets bad, she won't be streaming her POV.

243
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:20,860
So, but yeah, it's going to be like me.

244
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:21,360
I don't know.

245
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:25,540
I think we're getting a fourth player, but we're like still deciding who to bring as a fourth.

246
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:29,680
But yeah, Fillion invited me and Doobie to play Kingdom of Life 2.

247
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:33,560
So yes, that is a confirmed stream on Friday.

248
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,100
I think it's at 3 p.m.

249
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:35,420
PST.

250
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:37,040
I gotta look back at the thing again.

251
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:41,440
And then on Saturday, I know you guys might forget about this, but you guys don't know.

252
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:44,340
We have an Apex custom on the 30th that I'm organizing.

253
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:48,040
That is like has been the most hellish thing to organize so far.

254
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:59,160
I've never had a rougher time organizing an event because I had so many other things going on at the moment.

255
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:12,740
So I had like a lot, like it was just very unlucky because I had a lot of other stuff going around, going around at the time trying to organize this custom.

256
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:20,940
But on Saturday, I will most likely be announcing the teams and the participants and the rules and everything.

257
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:30,520
So everything about the custom will be announced on Saturday and on and then the custom itself will be on the 30th.

258
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:33,220
So that's like the tentative schedule at the moment.

259
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:37,100
I still have no idea if I'm going to be streaming tomorrow because I am still not okay.

260
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:42,420
I think you guys can hear from my voice that I'm still not okay.

261
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:45,460
But like we're gonna fucking make it guys.

262
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,880
We're gonna make it.

263
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:55,840
By the way guys, I know like, you know, by the way, I hope you guys don't forget, but I am sponsored today.

264
00:21:56,140 --> 00:22:05,080
So a huge shout out to MSI for sponsoring me to play, to check out Stalker 2.

265
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:11,060
They actually sent me one of the monitors that is in the promotion.

266
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:12,680
It's ginormous.

267
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:23,480
I've never played on such a big monitor before and it's like, it's honestly been really cool to use that monitor and everything.

268
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,060
So yeah, I endorse it.

269
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:29,980
I actually got a chance to use it and everything.

270
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:37,300
It's actually been like, it's been like really cool using one of the monitors because I never used an MSI monitor before.

271
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:40,580
So it was a great experience and I mean it's free.

272
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:43,940
That's the best part.

273
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:47,900
I sure do love free stuff.

274
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:57,400
And yeah, and you guys should really, you know, if you want to support me, support MSI, support this stream, you should check out their monitors.

275
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:11,400
If you're here to game, they have really good monitors for gaming regarding refresh rate and just the response time and everything.

276
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:13,680
They're really good for that.

277
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:24,380
So it's more so, especially if you're really into gaming-wise and want a good monitor with good hertz, good refresh rate, good reaction time to everything.

278
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:28,260
And I would highly check out the MSI monitor.

279
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:32,040
Anyway, let's check out Stalker.

280
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:35,660
That's literally like the sponsored part of the portion.

281
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:38,020
So now, we're gaming.

282
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:42,430
I love MSI.

283
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:45,250
They're literally like, just play the game for as long as you want.

284
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:47,810
Like, we just want you to talk about the monitor.

285
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:49,150
And I'm like, cool.

286
00:23:54,430 --> 00:23:57,230
Now I can talk my shit.

287
00:23:59,650 --> 00:24:01,530
Genji, welcome to the tomato farm.

288
00:24:01,670 --> 00:24:02,630
Welcome, welcome.

289
00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:06,550
Loose guidelines, let's go.

290
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:09,610
Rube, thank you for the super chat.

291
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:10,530
Thank you, thank you.

292
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:12,390
I love the original Stalker games.

293
00:24:12,610 --> 00:24:13,370
Love the streams.

294
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:14,830
Thank you for the super chat, Rube.

295
00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:15,930
Thank you, thank you.

296
00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:20,650
Alright, let's check out how we're going to do this.

297
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:23,670
I guess that should be fine.

298
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:25,270
We're going to play in English, guys.

299
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:25,910
I'm not reading.

300
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:26,730
I'm sorry.

301
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:28,550
Thank you for the super chat.

302
00:24:28,650 --> 00:24:29,570
Thank you, thank you.

303
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:31,110
Hope you get well soon, Doki.

304
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:33,250
Stalker is my favorite game series.

305
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:38,430
I was playing two for almost ten hours since the launch.

306
00:24:38,530 --> 00:24:39,310
Thank you for the super chat.

307
00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:40,370
Thank you, thank you.

308
00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:41,970
Oh, that means like, it might be...

309
00:24:42,810 --> 00:24:45,590
I never played the original Stalker series.

310
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:49,590
So, I've actually been wanting to for a while to play the original Stalker series.

311
00:24:49,810 --> 00:24:50,850
But, time.

312
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:53,510
Time and I'm stuck in Silent Hill.

313
00:24:53,930 --> 00:24:56,090
Like, I will never leave the hell.

314
00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:01,570
It's 2025 and I'm still here.

315
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:02,770
It's going to be 2025.

316
00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:06,150
And we're still going to be stuck in Silent Hill.

317
00:25:10,150 --> 00:25:13,030
I was like, Gordon, thank you for the magenta soup.

318
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:14,290
Thank you.

319
00:25:14,290 --> 00:25:15,470
It's my birthday.

320
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:20,090
I couldn't ask for a better birthday present than the waifu cup dropping and my oshi streaming today.

321
00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:22,010
It's been amazing watching you this year.

322
00:25:22,290 --> 00:25:23,850
Here's to another year of great stream.

323
00:25:24,150 --> 00:25:25,890
Also, vote Doki for VTuber of the year.

324
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:27,710
Thank you for the magenta soup, Gordon.

325
00:25:27,850 --> 00:25:28,790
Thank you, thank you.

326
00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:30,310
Happy birthday to you.

327
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:31,870
Happy birthday to you.

328
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:33,410
Happy birthday, dear Gordon.

329
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:34,970
Happy birthday to you.

330
00:25:35,050 --> 00:25:35,430
Yeah!

331
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:39,710
By the way, I almost forgot to tell you guys the most important part.

332
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:45,660
I have metal forks now.

333
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,520
Still no plates though.

334
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:52,660
Baby steps.

335
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:55,460
I have metal forks now.

336
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:57,740
I don't have plates still.

337
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,640
I'm still using paper plates.

338
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:03,120
But at least I have utensils.

339
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:06,460
I have utensils.

340
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:08,400
Okay, guys?

341
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:14,820
I'm actually making progress to a functioning human being.

342
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:15,480
Alright.

343
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Thank you for pre-ordering.

344
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:17,800
Yay!

345
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:19,980
I also got a free copy of Stalker too.

346
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:20,840
Thank you, Emisa.

347
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,280
Thank you.

348
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:24,500
And you too!

349
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:25,620
What the fuck?

350
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:26,240
Rookie?

351
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:27,860
Oh, wait.

352
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:28,580
There's like...

353
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:29,160
No, maybe...

354
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,640
No, maybe I can do...

355
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:31,360
Okay.

356
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,560
I was gonna be like, rookie!

357
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:36,360
And then the next level is literally Stalker and Veteran.

358
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,300
So I'm like, oh, wait.

359
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:40,000
I actually don't know if rookie is...

360
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,760
Maybe I deserve to be in rookie level.

361
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:43,700
I don't fucking...

362
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:44,740
I don't know.

363
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:47,220
Okay.

364
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:52,020
Let's make it large because I feel like we need that.

365
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:53,920
Hit indicator.

366
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:54,540
Compass.

367
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:55,300
Ammo.

368
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:56,220
I've never played...

369
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:58,920
Like I said, I've never played Stalker before.

370
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,400
So like, okay.

371
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:02,020
Maybe not that.

372
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,200
I'll try...

373
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:09,420
Okay, let's get motion blur at zero.

374
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:10,280
Oh, wait.

375
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,220
Depth of field.

376
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:14,280
Okay, reset this though.

377
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:15,620
I think I gotta reset this.

378
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,980
I fucked up the settings already for this.

379
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,400
Motion blur quality low.

380
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:23,220
Can I turn it off?

381
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,200
Motion blur...

382
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:26,260
Zero.

383
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:27,620
Medium.

384
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:30,740
Performance boost.

385
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:33,620
We'll figure this out when we adjust this at another time.

386
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,280
But we gotta get the motion blur out of the way.

387
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:37,200
F.

388
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,740
Full screen borderless.

389
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:44,160
Full screen exclusive.

390
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:44,940
Okay.

391
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,560
Gotta get full screen exclusive.

392
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:50,640
Should field of view be at 90?

393
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:51,660
I don't know.

394
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:52,780
I don't know.

395
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:54,940
Any Stalker pros know if...

396
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:57,880
Know if I should do it at 90?

397
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:00,220
Alright, sound.

398
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:00,940
Mute all.

399
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:02,780
Also, is sound guy even alive right now?

400
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:03,900
It's been a while, sound guy.

401
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:05,980
I don't even know if you're still alive.

402
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:13,120
Does sound guy still know how to do sound things?

403
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:13,880
Who knows?

404
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,620
Who knows?

405
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:22,320
Alright, sound controls.

406
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:23,660
Mouth sensitivity.

407
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:25,900
I'm just gonna put it at 8 just in case.

408
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,200
Just in case.

409
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:30,960
I need to make sure it's...

410
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:31,500
Hold.

411
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:32,460
Hold breath.

412
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:33,560
Hold breath?

413
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:34,860
Wait, what?

414
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,480
Hold to walk.

415
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:36,960
Lean.

416
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:38,200
Oh, okay.

417
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:40,380
I just don't see sound guy, guys.

418
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,120
I don't...

419
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,360
Guys, we have an issue.

420
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,500
I don't think sound guy is alive anymore.

421
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:50,560
Where...

422
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,820
Where is he?

423
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,040
Okay, this is...

424
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:56,200
We're gonna have a little bit of an issue.

425
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:57,320
Oh, wait, what?

426
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,520
I didn't confirm?

427
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:00,360
Oh, fuck.

428
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:00,640
Okay.

429
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:04,600
Let's do...

430
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,360
We have backup sound guy?

431
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:06,920
We do?

432
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,260
Who?

433
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:11,180
Wait, who?

434
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,280
Who is it?

435
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:18,000
Alright, let's see.

436
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,540
The zone token.

437
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:20,600
I'm gonna understand that.

438
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:21,340
What?

439
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:23,080
I pressed F!

440
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,160
Okay, let me try this again.

441
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:27,440
F.

442
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:31,500
Oh, after the game is restarted.

443
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:31,900
Okay.

444
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,260
I gotta restart the game, apparently.

445
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,480
Okay, guys, we gotta restart.

446
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:37,980
We thought we were...

447
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:40,880
We thought we got right into it, but...

448
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,040
We have to restart the game.

449
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:42,800
Give me a sec.

450
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:44,960
Alright.

451
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:45,700
Now!

452
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:47,280
Now we're here!

453
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:49,400
Johnny, thank you for the super chat.

454
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:50,140
Thank you, thank you.

455
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,560
Backup sound guy.

456
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:53,020
I choose you!

457
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:54,960
Thank you for the super chat, Johnny.

458
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:55,860
Thank you, thank you.

459
00:29:58,640 --> 00:29:59,080
Alright.

460
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:01,860
Alright.

461
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:02,520
Here we go.

462
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,220
Now we're gaming for real, guys.

463
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:05,920
Now it's gaming hours.

464
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:06,540
Oh my gosh.

465
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,640
It's so weird to be streaming again.

466
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:12,900
I always, like, whenever I take a break, it's so weird to get back into streaming.

467
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:15,140
Cause it's like, how the fuck do I do all that?

468
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:17,400
How the fuck do I function as a person?

469
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,500
Oh yeah, but anyway.

470
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:23,380
I was...

471
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:24,180
We have to compile!

472
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:24,840
Okay, guys.

473
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,140
I didn't realize!

474
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:28,700
We have to compile shaders again!

475
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:31,900
It has to be faster, cause I already did it once.

476
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:36,160
It has to be faster, right?

477
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:37,620
Yeah, okay, cause we already did it.

478
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:38,200
Anyway.

479
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:43,040
The reason why I was sleeping at, like, 6 to 7 AM.

480
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:44,800
It's not just because of Overwatch.

481
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,220
I relapsed, by the way.

482
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:50,320
For those who don't follow me on Twitter, I have indeed relapsed back into Overwatch.

483
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,340
Back into the toxic relationship of Overwatch 2.

484
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:57,260
But, like, you don't understand.

485
00:30:57,260 --> 00:31:00,380
He's, like, he's changed, guys.

486
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:02,040
Like, you don't understand.

487
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:06,780
He's brought back classic mode, guys.

488
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:10,960
I don't play that mode, but, like, you know, he's attempting to change.

489
00:31:15,310 --> 00:31:25,230
He gave me an 8 game win streak in solo queue masters chat.

490
00:31:25,470 --> 00:31:27,390
You guys don't know how rare that is.

491
00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:30,990
No, I know I'm lagging cause the compiling shaders.

492
00:31:31,570 --> 00:31:34,310
He told me he won't hurt me again.

493
00:31:38,610 --> 00:31:40,090
It's different, guys.

494
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:41,450
It's different.

495
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:43,370
I got an 8, guys.

496
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:46,250
I got an 8 game win streak, guys.

497
00:31:46,430 --> 00:31:49,350
We're not gonna talk about what happened after the 8 game win streak.

498
00:31:49,530 --> 00:31:53,970
Just focus on the fact that it was an 8 game win streak.

499
00:31:57,510 --> 00:32:00,090
That's all that matters, guys.

500
00:32:00,370 --> 00:32:03,430
We don't talk about what happened after the 8 game win streak.

501
00:32:03,730 --> 00:32:05,710
Wait, I can't change the difficulty?

502
00:32:07,810 --> 00:32:09,210
Wait, what do you mean?

503
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:10,650
I don't wanna be rookie.

504
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:12,910
They're gonna make fun of me.

505
00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:14,950
Like, your goons are gonna make fun of me.

506
00:32:15,010 --> 00:32:17,950
And then they're like, oh, and we're gonna nominate her for gamer of the year?

507
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:20,190
Like...

508
00:32:23,790 --> 00:32:24,950
Oh, I said it in.

509
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:25,990
Okay, okay.

510
00:32:25,990 --> 00:32:29,370
I don't want them to make fun of me.

511
00:32:30,650 --> 00:32:31,590
Oh, okay.

512
00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:33,770
Looking for a balance between story.

513
00:32:33,950 --> 00:32:35,990
Oh, this is beginner, beginner.

514
00:32:36,470 --> 00:32:37,530
Alright, we'll do soccer.

515
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:43,550
Is it okay that I didn't play the original series?

516
00:32:43,930 --> 00:32:45,410
Like, is it okay?

517
00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:50,170
Freedoms always believed that a stone could bring out the best in folks, erasing the lines that...

518
00:32:50,170 --> 00:32:51,530
Alright, I never wanted to read anyway.

519
00:32:52,410 --> 00:32:52,970
Woah.

520
00:32:54,190 --> 00:32:54,750
Woah.

521
00:32:55,990 --> 00:32:56,890
What's happening?

522
00:32:57,070 --> 00:32:57,790
Is this Chernobyl?

523
00:32:59,470 --> 00:33:00,650
Is this the radiation?

524
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:11,230
Rookie, what a weenie.

525
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:13,890
Go back to Weenie Hut Jr, Doki.

526
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:16,570
Also, Dango, thank you for the super chat.

527
00:33:16,650 --> 00:33:17,610
Thank you, thank you.

528
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:19,410
Oh, what's that?

529
00:33:19,490 --> 00:33:20,230
Is that radiation?

530
00:33:28,110 --> 00:33:29,110
That's fine.

531
00:33:29,390 --> 00:33:30,210
What are you gonna do?

532
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:31,770
Fucking...

533
00:33:32,190 --> 00:33:32,930
Take me out?

534
00:33:34,330 --> 00:33:36,110
We don't need streamer mode.

535
00:33:36,110 --> 00:33:38,310
Let's listen to some fucking...

536
00:33:38,930 --> 00:33:40,750
Let's listen to some songs.

537
00:33:56,930 --> 00:33:58,750
Goodbye, I want no spoilers.

538
00:33:59,850 --> 00:34:01,290
What the fuck are you doing?

539
00:34:06,930 --> 00:34:07,530
What?

540
00:34:16,910 --> 00:34:18,110
The zone?

541
00:34:18,470 --> 00:34:21,290
Wait, that's what all the Dragoons kept talking about.

542
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:24,190
They're here to show support.

543
00:34:24,930 --> 00:34:26,470
True, true.

544
00:34:26,550 --> 00:34:30,130
They're like, we know Doki's gonna have like 20 minutes of just talking to people.

545
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:35,450
That's Dragoon right there.

546
00:34:35,450 --> 00:34:36,230
He knows me.

547
00:34:37,490 --> 00:34:40,950
He knows I would spend 20 or 30 minutes just chatting first.

548
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:54,140
Yeah,

549
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,220
if the government says everything is fine, then it should be the case, right?

550
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:10,700
Oh, wait.

551
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:14,480
Oh, wait, I'm the...

552
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,700
I'm holding the radiation.

553
00:35:21,310 --> 00:35:22,450
Surely, right?

554
00:35:22,810 --> 00:35:24,170
The government lying?

555
00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:29,050
I shouldn't say that, I'm gonna fucking fall out a window.

556
00:35:30,490 --> 00:35:31,370
Did you guys...

557
00:35:32,350 --> 00:35:35,050
Did you guys read that?

558
00:35:35,990 --> 00:35:40,250
There's been suspiciously a lot of people falling out of windows.

559
00:35:44,390 --> 00:35:45,590
No, Doki!

560
00:35:46,250 --> 00:35:46,730
No!

561
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:51,630
See that?

562
00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:54,270
It was a hell of a blast.

563
00:35:55,550 --> 00:35:56,730
Can't remember one.

564
00:35:57,690 --> 00:35:58,810
So fierce.

565
00:35:58,950 --> 00:35:59,890
Yeah, see, I'm okay.

566
00:36:00,370 --> 00:36:02,870
It was nice knowing you.

567
00:36:08,110 --> 00:36:12,530
Oh, man, that's a nice window over there.

568
00:36:14,370 --> 00:36:15,830
There's another way in.

569
00:36:16,350 --> 00:36:18,410
Crack in the wall to the left of the fort.

570
00:36:21,170 --> 00:36:21,810
Pugger off?

571
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:21,950
Pugger off?

572
00:36:21,950 --> 00:36:22,590
Wait, am I not...

573
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:23,850
Oh, maybe he's, like, foreign.

574
00:36:24,690 --> 00:36:25,690
I mean, to be fair...

575
00:36:25,690 --> 00:36:26,270
I mean...

576
00:36:26,270 --> 00:36:29,130
Wait, I mean, like, foreign in a foreign country.

577
00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:34,750
Let's see, why is there a British man here?

578
00:36:50,450 --> 00:36:51,410
A British Russian.

579
00:36:53,370 --> 00:36:55,650
I don't know, I thought he was talking in more of an accent.

580
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:59,890
Well, I mean, he's talking in an accent, but, you know, not a British accent.

581
00:37:00,650 --> 00:37:01,010
Like...

582
00:37:01,450 --> 00:37:03,710
Don't worry, this will look good in the British Museum.

583
00:37:18,830 --> 00:37:19,690
Laundry basket?

584
00:37:19,690 --> 00:37:20,990
Don't lie to him!

585
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:28,960
I like how he just casually chucks it, even though it's, like, a very important artifact.

586
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:31,120
It's clearly not that important.

587
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,120
Yeah, that's right, nerd.

588
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:48,920
That's fucking right, nerd!

589
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:52,960
Yeah, he wants to do it again!

590
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,500
I was ready to see you there.

591
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,080
Want me to put you in the locker next?

592
00:38:06,330 --> 00:38:08,090
I'm gonna stuff him in the locker.

593
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,900
I didn't really thought he was him.

594
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:28,720
Okay, so we gotta take this back to...

595
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,100
Oh my god, am I in the zone?

596
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:33,220
Is this the zone?

597
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:38,180
I'm gonna ask every time I head somewhere, I'm like, no, is this the zone?

598
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:44,720
Am I in the zone now?

599
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:48,180
Now I'm in the zone.

600
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:49,720
Okay, so...

601
00:38:53,670 --> 00:38:54,550
Wait, what?

602
00:38:57,530 --> 00:38:58,550
Cross the perimeter.

603
00:38:58,830 --> 00:38:59,810
Okay, we're gonna head out.

604
00:38:59,910 --> 00:39:01,030
What's the worst that could happen?

605
00:39:01,650 --> 00:39:02,530
We're in the zone!

606
00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:03,730
Oh, L.

607
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:04,910
Alright.

608
00:39:05,330 --> 00:39:06,650
What's the worst that could happen?

609
00:39:06,730 --> 00:39:07,610
Since we're in the zone.

610
00:39:07,610 --> 00:39:08,270
I'm in the zone.

611
00:39:08,330 --> 00:39:09,010
I'm locked in.

612
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:10,990
Alright, I'm reloading first, though.

613
00:39:11,490 --> 00:39:12,850
Reloading first in the zone.

614
00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:15,030
Guess we have to go here.

615
00:39:16,090 --> 00:39:18,450
Assume there's, like, nothing I need to pick up yet.

616
00:39:18,830 --> 00:39:19,790
Since it's the beginning.

617
00:39:20,890 --> 00:39:21,750
Is this Chernobyl?

618
00:39:24,390 --> 00:39:24,830
Ooh.

619
00:39:26,470 --> 00:39:28,050
Oh, it's a little spooky.

620
00:39:28,330 --> 00:39:30,190
Did I trick myself into playing a scary game?

621
00:39:30,770 --> 00:39:30,970
Did I?

622
00:39:32,450 --> 00:39:33,290
Oh, fuck.

623
00:39:33,430 --> 00:39:34,310
Hello, I'm drinking the soda.

624
00:39:34,610 --> 00:39:34,870
Whoops.

625
00:39:35,890 --> 00:39:36,370
Um...

626
00:39:36,370 --> 00:39:37,130
Press F, okay.

627
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:40,290
Let's see.

628
00:39:40,970 --> 00:39:43,490
Tap to open and use to change your weapon.

629
00:39:46,210 --> 00:39:46,690
Okay.

630
00:39:48,050 --> 00:39:49,550
Guys, this looks a little spooky.

631
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:51,630
Is this supposed to be a spooky game?

632
00:39:53,470 --> 00:39:53,950
Huh?

633
00:39:54,930 --> 00:39:56,070
It's okay, I have a gun.

634
00:39:56,290 --> 00:39:57,090
I'm not too scared.

635
00:39:57,530 --> 00:39:59,290
When you have a gun, it's not as scary.

636
00:40:02,490 --> 00:40:04,430
Guys, to be fair...

637
00:40:04,430 --> 00:40:08,450
Comparing this to Silent Hill is, like, not even a thing.

638
00:40:09,750 --> 00:40:10,270
Like...

639
00:40:10,270 --> 00:40:10,910
I...

640
00:40:10,910 --> 00:40:14,570
This is actually a lot less spooky than Silent Hill.

641
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:17,990
Maybe some items can be...

642
00:40:17,990 --> 00:40:19,050
Okay, I have to be the knife man.

643
00:40:19,990 --> 00:40:20,690
That's right.

644
00:40:20,830 --> 00:40:23,030
God, how fucking strong am I?

645
00:40:25,810 --> 00:40:26,370
Hello?

646
00:40:27,790 --> 00:40:28,890
Knock knock.

647
00:40:31,050 --> 00:40:31,610
Hello?

648
00:40:34,110 --> 00:40:34,670
Okay.

649
00:40:35,090 --> 00:40:35,370
Grab.

650
00:40:35,630 --> 00:40:36,950
Take the gun out first.

651
00:40:37,490 --> 00:40:38,790
Oh, I'm in the mines.

652
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:43,500
Oh?

653
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:49,320
Oh, but...

654
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:50,080
Put down the...

655
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:51,480
Oh, I saw the sound effects.

656
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:51,840
Okay.

657
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:55,180
Put down the sound effects a little bit.

658
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:57,300
I'll put it at 85.

659
00:40:57,660 --> 00:40:58,660
And then...

660
00:40:58,660 --> 00:40:58,840
Alright.

661
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:03,360
I'll put that at 70 so I can raise up the volume a little bit.

662
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:05,220
Boop.

663
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:07,000
Alright, I'll put it here.

664
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:07,600
Alright, guys.

665
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:09,620
Before I continue, I actually need...

666
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:10,760
I need to get...

667
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:11,580
My cough drops.

668
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,000
I'll be right back real fast.

669
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:15,140
Alright.

670
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:32,860
I have to get cough drops.

671
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:34,180
Oh!

672
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:37,760
Alright.

673
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:38,880
Okay.

674
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:40,220
I'm ready.

675
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:41,320
Also, I saw some...

676
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:42,440
It's somebody else's birthday.

677
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:44,720
But I'll wish you a happy birthday very soon.

678
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:46,900
I just want to shoot one person.

679
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:49,280
Save changes.

680
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:49,720
Okay.

681
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:51,540
Can't be that bad.

682
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:54,100
Why do I need a fire?

683
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:55,420
There's nothing in front of me.

684
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:56,800
Oh!

685
00:41:58,940 --> 00:41:59,460
What?

686
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,600
What the fuck was that?

687
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:03,340
What was that?

688
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:07,380
The fuck is that?

689
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:09,460
Hello?

690
00:42:14,110 --> 00:42:14,570
Boop!

691
00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:17,970
Anomies are...

692
00:42:17,970 --> 00:42:19,770
Never let your guard down in the zone.

693
00:42:20,330 --> 00:42:20,830
Okay.

694
00:42:21,970 --> 00:42:23,510
This is my inventory.

695
00:42:25,290 --> 00:42:25,850
Boop!

696
00:42:26,350 --> 00:42:27,550
Oh my god.

697
00:42:27,650 --> 00:42:27,990
Stop!

698
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:33,420
Wait, I won't take all of it.

699
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:39,220
How do I take all of it?

700
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:41,240
Take all.

701
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:42,140
Okay, there we go.

702
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:45,180
He seems very friendly.

703
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:47,740
Do I have...

704
00:42:47,740 --> 00:42:49,000
Can I equip this?

705
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:52,240
Q, Z, E...

706
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:54,340
Okay.

707
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:58,680
Alright, now I have this gun.

708
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:00,320
Okay, so...

709
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:00,940
He doesn't...

710
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:02,460
So, he doesn't seem very...

711
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:04,440
Friendly.

712
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:05,260
So, I'm just gonna...

713
00:43:06,580 --> 00:43:07,440
Do that.

714
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:15,880
What?

715
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,640
I had to loot so fast!

716
00:43:19,620 --> 00:43:20,440
Okay, nice.

717
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:21,540
He's dead.

718
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:23,460
Oh, please don't tell me he's gonna come over.

719
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:24,840
Please don't tell me he's gonna come over.

720
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:28,240
Alright, gotta look at my iPad.

721
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:29,700
I got...

722
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:31,520
Let me...

723
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:38,120
All personnel employed by the International Perimeter must comply with the following standards outlined in the code.

724
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:39,760
Let me know...

725
00:43:41,060 --> 00:43:42,140
How the...

726
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:43,340
How it is now.

727
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:45,300
Ensuring the safety and security of the perimeter.

728
00:43:45,980 --> 00:43:48,820
Enter areas of anonymous activity except when required.

729
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:49,600
Alright.

730
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:51,660
A frying pan into the fire.

731
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:55,400
Return after three years of service in real hell to cool off.

732
00:43:55,740 --> 00:43:57,920
Quietly trading dummies, the cheapest artifacts.

733
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:01,580
Burnt out after being taken out of the zone by some lucky stalkers.

734
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:02,240
Drinking...

735
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:02,680
Oh my god!

736
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:03,760
Name drop!

737
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:08,560
And everything seemed to be going according to plan until my flat got blown to smithereens one night.

738
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:11,150
An anomaly right in my kitchen.

739
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:14,740
It wrecked the little I had and left behind another dummy.

740
00:44:15,180 --> 00:44:16,980
Only this time, it was different.

741
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:18,760
A special anomaly.

742
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:19,680
A special dummy.

743
00:44:20,020 --> 00:44:20,520
And...

744
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:22,120
If a certain Herman is to be believed.

745
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:25,300
Special money I managed to recharge with a scientific gadget.

746
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:26,780
The catch is...

747
00:44:26,780 --> 00:44:28,760
I'll have to venture into the zone to do it.

748
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:32,260
I've heard of enough stories to avoid the zone at all costs.

749
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:33,980
But I decided to reach out to me.

750
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:34,740
Okay.

751
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:35,840
Oh, so that's me!

752
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:37,240
I had to do this thing.

753
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:39,200
Um...

754
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:40,680
Alan, thank you for the magenta soup!

755
00:44:40,860 --> 00:44:42,100
Thank you, thank you!

756
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:44,080
I'm sorry I didn't use your code to buy the cup, Doki.

757
00:44:44,180 --> 00:44:45,640
The shipping price was exorbitant.

758
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:47,120
Separator gives some of it to you!

759
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:48,680
Thank you for the magenta soup!

760
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:49,980
Thank you, thank you!

761
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:51,040
It's okay.

762
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:53,380
I really appreciate it, guys.

763
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:57,280
For everybody that bought the gamer sub stuff.

764
00:44:57,680 --> 00:44:58,020
Um...

765
00:44:58,020 --> 00:44:58,880
Because, like...

766
00:44:58,880 --> 00:44:59,120
Um...

767
00:44:59,120 --> 00:44:59,560
You guys didn't know.

768
00:44:59,660 --> 00:45:01,440
The cells determines if...

769
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:02,320
Um...

770
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:03,220
Wait, which one do I go?

771
00:45:03,340 --> 00:45:05,180
Deep into the dark, scary sewers?

772
00:45:05,540 --> 00:45:06,420
Or the outside?

773
00:45:07,660 --> 00:45:09,100
Well, it says to go outside.

774
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:17,280
Wait, but what about spooky, dark sewers?

775
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:18,600
Oh, hey!

776
00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:21,660
Ooh.

777
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:23,320
Ooh!

778
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:23,860
Ha!

779
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:24,780
Okay.

780
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:28,140
Oh, wait!

781
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:29,360
This was the same area!

782
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:30,460
I didn't see this.

783
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:32,760
Alright.

784
00:45:33,740 --> 00:45:34,700
Okay, here we go.

785
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:36,400
I guess we go forward.

786
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:40,940
Main mission, the compass shows the information.

787
00:45:41,260 --> 00:45:41,520
Okay.

788
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:43,240
What?

789
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:44,300
What is that?

790
00:45:44,380 --> 00:45:45,420
What is that?!

791
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:47,040
What the fuck?!

792
00:45:50,430 --> 00:45:50,850
Oh!

793
00:45:51,530 --> 00:45:52,390
Oh, no!

794
00:45:52,550 --> 00:45:53,450
No, I'm trying to...

795
00:45:53,450 --> 00:45:54,130
Oh!

796
00:45:54,450 --> 00:45:55,490
Oh, my God!

797
00:45:55,590 --> 00:45:58,050
How many HP does he have?!

798
00:45:58,050 --> 00:45:58,150
Oh, my God!

799
00:45:58,810 --> 00:45:59,350
Wait.

800
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:00,470
Wait, how do I heal?

801
00:46:00,830 --> 00:46:01,810
I don't remember!

802
00:46:02,650 --> 00:46:03,490
I'm bleeding!

803
00:46:04,510 --> 00:46:05,410
Oh, is it healed?

804
00:46:06,670 --> 00:46:07,650
Okay, I'm okay.

805
00:46:08,350 --> 00:46:09,270
Okay, I'm okay.

806
00:46:10,010 --> 00:46:10,550
Okay.

807
00:46:10,990 --> 00:46:12,310
The fuck was that?

808
00:46:13,350 --> 00:46:15,490
Like, I had zero contacts.

809
00:46:18,690 --> 00:46:20,430
What the fuck was that?

810
00:46:22,570 --> 00:46:23,850
Okay, hold Q.

811
00:46:23,950 --> 00:46:24,570
Okay, it's fine.

812
00:46:24,590 --> 00:46:25,290
I'm okay now.

813
00:46:25,890 --> 00:46:26,970
I used a needle.

814
00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:29,470
I used a very clean needle.

815
00:46:29,590 --> 00:46:30,670
Everything is fine.

816
00:46:30,890 --> 00:46:33,710
Anyway, for those who don't know, the amount of cells...

817
00:46:35,410 --> 00:46:36,330
Oh, hey, vodka.

818
00:46:36,950 --> 00:46:41,370
The amount of cells from the GamerSub stuff determines if I'm gonna get a flavor or not.

819
00:46:41,490 --> 00:46:43,810
So, I really appreciate everybody's support!

820
00:46:44,330 --> 00:46:47,350
You know, like, I didn't tweet anything yet about the GamerSub stuff.

821
00:46:48,070 --> 00:46:51,070
And then, like, I think, like, in the first...

822
00:46:51,070 --> 00:46:52,570
In the first, like...

823
00:46:52,570 --> 00:46:53,070
What the fuck?

824
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:56,030
In the first, like...

825
00:46:56,830 --> 00:46:59,030
Apparently, in the first, like, two hours...

826
00:46:59,030 --> 00:47:00,010
Wait, are they bad people?

827
00:47:01,150 --> 00:47:02,390
Oh, I think they're dead.

828
00:47:02,930 --> 00:47:04,070
Alright, okay.

829
00:47:04,430 --> 00:47:05,250
Woah, okay.

830
00:47:05,310 --> 00:47:06,010
I should've helped.

831
00:47:07,330 --> 00:47:07,730
They...

832
00:47:07,730 --> 00:47:10,770
We sold, like, a thousand cups in the first two hours.

833
00:47:10,990 --> 00:47:11,930
I think an hour and a half?

834
00:47:11,990 --> 00:47:12,410
I don't remember.

835
00:47:12,770 --> 00:47:14,290
I just woke up and they were like, Woah!

836
00:47:14,610 --> 00:47:15,530
You sold a thousand!

837
00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:16,590
And I was like, what?

838
00:47:18,590 --> 00:47:19,390
That's crazy.

839
00:47:20,770 --> 00:47:21,630
Oh, I've stopped bleeding.

840
00:47:22,330 --> 00:47:25,510
Guys, I don't know if you guys know this, but...

841
00:47:25,510 --> 00:47:28,810
If you wait long enough, the bleeding starts to stop.

842
00:47:28,970 --> 00:47:31,990
Because, like, your blood starts, like, uh...

843
00:47:31,990 --> 00:47:32,890
What is it called?

844
00:47:32,990 --> 00:47:33,890
Like, the scabbing?

845
00:47:34,130 --> 00:47:35,450
That's what scabbing is.

846
00:47:37,830 --> 00:47:38,390
Guys...

847
00:47:39,790 --> 00:47:43,650
Why do I need bandages when I can just wait until it scabs up?

848
00:47:44,250 --> 00:47:45,870
Guys, don't take medical advice from me.

849
00:47:49,770 --> 00:47:52,770
Might not be good to wait.

850
00:47:56,610 --> 00:47:58,050
Open the door.

851
00:47:58,190 --> 00:48:04,070
I mean, technically, yeah.

852
00:48:04,830 --> 00:48:05,590
But...

853
00:48:05,590 --> 00:48:06,770
Just don't let...

854
00:48:06,770 --> 00:48:08,470
Just don't touch anything bad!

855
00:48:09,030 --> 00:48:10,950
If you don't touch anything bad...

856
00:48:10,950 --> 00:48:12,810
Technically, you can't get an infection.

857
00:48:18,310 --> 00:48:19,250
Wait, what the fuck?

858
00:48:20,470 --> 00:48:21,050
Yvonne?

859
00:48:22,010 --> 00:48:22,950
What happened?

860
00:48:23,250 --> 00:48:23,850
What is this?

861
00:48:24,370 --> 00:48:25,810
Anti-radiation drugs?

862
00:48:25,810 --> 00:48:28,090
See, I told you a little radiation wouldn't hurt.

863
00:48:30,250 --> 00:48:30,730
Okay...

864
00:48:30,730 --> 00:48:32,290
When do I know if I'm starting...

865
00:48:32,290 --> 00:48:33,530
If I'm gonna get radiated?

866
00:48:35,710 --> 00:48:36,190
Hello?

867
00:48:39,570 --> 00:48:40,050
Oh...

868
00:48:40,050 --> 00:48:42,090
That's not a good sign.

869
00:48:44,210 --> 00:48:45,750
I just, like...

870
00:48:45,750 --> 00:48:46,810
I'm just gonna take everything.

871
00:48:46,970 --> 00:48:47,610
Wait, what's this?

872
00:48:47,770 --> 00:48:48,870
Oh, I got an artifact!

873
00:48:51,350 --> 00:48:51,830
Nice.

874
00:48:55,210 --> 00:48:56,390
Can open this.

875
00:48:56,490 --> 00:48:57,390
So I have to go this way.

876
00:48:57,570 --> 00:48:58,610
Wait, you have a gun!

877
00:48:59,450 --> 00:49:00,070
Thank you.

878
00:49:01,270 --> 00:49:02,650
So I have to go this way, then.

879
00:49:04,270 --> 00:49:05,870
Get a double barrel ASAP.

880
00:49:05,970 --> 00:49:06,310
The fuck?

881
00:49:06,330 --> 00:49:07,490
Where am I gonna get a double barrel?

882
00:49:07,550 --> 00:49:08,430
I just got here.

883
00:49:10,190 --> 00:49:12,550
Guys, if they're dead, it's free real estate.

884
00:49:13,390 --> 00:49:15,130
That's why grave robbing is legal.

885
00:49:16,250 --> 00:49:18,290
I work for a British man, so, like...

886
00:49:18,290 --> 00:49:19,250
He endorsed it.

887
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:23,040
Okay...

888
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:24,820
What's this?

889
00:49:25,340 --> 00:49:26,780
I don't even know what I'm taking anymore.

890
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:28,000
I got his...

891
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:28,940
iPad.

892
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:31,220
I got scientific medkit.

893
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:32,600
Oh!

894
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:34,160
New lore!

895
00:49:35,540 --> 00:49:36,320
New lore!

896
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:38,900
I can't open the new lore, that's okay.

897
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:41,820
I didn't wanna know anyway.

898
00:49:42,740 --> 00:49:49,260
Volition, as project leader, I'm ordering you to remain in the bunker until we receive the suits from the Institute.

899
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:50,740
Safety comes first.

900
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:58,740
Regardless of any side radiation coefficients you might have detected, if you venture into that cave one more time, I'll kick you out personally.

901
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:01,740
First out of the cave, then out of this project.

902
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:04,200
Got it?

903
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:05,860
Yes, it's all on my laptop.

904
00:50:06,220 --> 00:50:07,880
How long will these coordinates be up to date?

905
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:09,940
Until the next emission.

906
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:13,160
So that guy of yours should move his ass.

907
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:15,500
There's someone at the bunker.

908
00:50:15,820 --> 00:50:17,100
That might be the man who...

909
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:17,400
Wait!

910
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:20,180
Wait, so they were mine...

911
00:50:20,180 --> 00:50:21,380
Wait, so this was recent!

912
00:50:26,220 --> 00:50:28,460
They literally just died cause they saw me.

913
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:32,640
Wait, no, don't say that.

914
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:37,180
Stop freaking out and tell me where the data is stored.

915
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:39,860
Herman, calm the fuck down, Herman!

916
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:45,120
You can't say that when I'm already deep in the zone!

917
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:48,660
If you want me to do well...

918
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:54,520
Oh no...

919
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:55,640
Oh no...

920
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:59,940
Why did he say that when I'm in the zone already?

921
00:50:59,940 --> 00:51:04,300
At least, like, lie to me.

922
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:06,920
Okay, copy data.

923
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:15,180
I mean, he can mute himself and he's gonna freak out.

924
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:15,900
Just mute yourself.

925
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:17,000
Just...

926
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,640
Mute yourself now.

927
00:51:30,700 --> 00:51:31,420
Huh?

928
00:51:53,510 --> 00:51:54,230
Oh...

929
00:51:54,230 --> 00:51:55,910
Wait, no, I don't want to figure it out.

930
00:51:56,010 --> 00:51:56,850
Hold my hand.

931
00:52:03,570 --> 00:52:05,890
There's dead people around me, sir!

932
00:52:18,550 --> 00:52:20,130
But the money's over there!

933
00:52:20,190 --> 00:52:21,290
That's the whole point!

934
00:52:21,870 --> 00:52:23,670
Also, Frank, I thank you for the 50...

935
00:52:32,150 --> 00:52:33,150
What's that sound?

936
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:34,570
Wait, did you guys hear that?

937
00:52:43,730 --> 00:52:44,210
Wait...

938
00:52:45,130 --> 00:52:46,210
Wait, what'd I do?

939
00:52:54,390 --> 00:52:56,110
How the fuck did they die?

940
00:53:01,790 --> 00:53:02,270
What?

941
00:53:14,030 --> 00:53:15,790
Okay, yeah, that would be a little...

942
00:53:15,790 --> 00:53:16,850
That would be a little bit embarrassing.

943
00:53:17,010 --> 00:53:18,610
Okay, so I need to find something...

944
00:53:18,610 --> 00:53:21,050
So I wouldn't die...

945
00:53:21,050 --> 00:53:22,370
From the entire thing.

946
00:53:23,250 --> 00:53:23,550
Oh!

947
00:53:23,950 --> 00:53:25,010
Oh, that's what I heard!

948
00:53:25,170 --> 00:53:26,290
I fucking knew it!

949
00:53:26,510 --> 00:53:27,590
I knew I heard...

950
00:53:27,590 --> 00:53:28,310
I knew it!

951
00:53:28,510 --> 00:53:30,110
I fucking knew I heard...

952
00:53:30,110 --> 00:53:30,910
I knew I heard a...

953
00:53:30,910 --> 00:53:32,110
I knew I heard this.

954
00:53:32,970 --> 00:53:34,830
Oh, why is it so dark?

955
00:53:34,890 --> 00:53:36,410
Is the zone always this dark?

956
00:53:36,490 --> 00:53:38,250
Does it not light up in the zone?

957
00:53:41,130 --> 00:53:41,750
Well...

958
00:53:41,750 --> 00:53:42,910
Well...

959
00:53:42,910 --> 00:53:44,750
Guys, do you guys think this is radi...

960
00:53:47,190 --> 00:53:49,230
What's the worst that could happen?

961
00:53:51,030 --> 00:53:54,670
Guys, do you think this is radiation?

962
00:53:57,590 --> 00:53:59,390
What's the worst that could...

963
00:53:59,390 --> 00:54:01,530
Don't step on those.

964
00:54:03,710 --> 00:54:05,810
But what if I become Spiderman?

965
00:54:09,450 --> 00:54:11,510
Guys, I could become Spiderman.

966
00:54:16,570 --> 00:54:18,770
Okay, we should go this way then.

967
00:54:22,580 --> 00:54:23,000
Or the...

968
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,800
Exactly, or the Hulk.

969
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:27,400
Guys, I could become the Hulk, guys.

970
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:30,980
I could become Red Hulk, guys.

971
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:35,460
Like I don't even see my HP anymore.

972
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:39,960
Okay, what can I do with vodka?

973
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:41,300
Or wat...

974
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:42,260
Sorry, water.

975
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:44,300
It's no easy task.

976
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:47,820
Fortunately, this isn't an issue in the mainland.

977
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:50,120
Oh, I think I'm getting irradiated.

978
00:54:51,900 --> 00:54:52,820
The yellow...

979
00:54:54,080 --> 00:54:54,540
Okay,

980
00:54:57,630 --> 00:54:58,690
it's like here.

981
00:55:05,270 --> 00:55:07,330
How do I get across then?

982
00:55:07,810 --> 00:55:08,790
Oh, oh!

983
00:55:09,070 --> 00:55:10,170
Oh, okay, I should...

984
00:55:10,170 --> 00:55:10,850
I should stop.

985
00:55:10,950 --> 00:55:12,110
I should stop getting close to that.

986
00:55:13,030 --> 00:55:15,250
Who thought that that was a bat?

987
00:55:15,350 --> 00:55:16,690
Is the water irradiated too?

988
00:55:17,470 --> 00:55:18,330
Oh, it is.

989
00:55:18,410 --> 00:55:18,710
Okay.

990
00:55:19,230 --> 00:55:20,110
But it's not irradiated.

991
00:55:21,950 --> 00:55:23,390
Guys, but it's yellow.

992
00:55:24,410 --> 00:55:26,870
Guys, they always say follow the yellow paint.

993
00:55:28,070 --> 00:55:29,610
It's actually yellow.

994
00:55:31,970 --> 00:55:32,690
What if I can...

995
00:55:32,690 --> 00:55:33,570
Okay, it's right here.

996
00:55:37,850 --> 00:55:39,950
Freaked out that I don't see anything.

997
00:55:45,170 --> 00:55:45,650
Oh...

998
00:55:45,650 --> 00:55:46,370
It's fine.

999
00:55:46,610 --> 00:55:47,350
It's fine.

1000
00:55:47,930 --> 00:55:49,650
A little radiation doesn't hurt anybody.

1001
00:55:50,470 --> 00:55:51,850
If I just like...

1002
00:55:51,850 --> 00:55:54,010
I just touch it a little bit...

1003
00:55:54,010 --> 00:55:55,710
So it can't be that bad.

1004
00:55:55,890 --> 00:55:56,470
Wait, what's this?

1005
00:55:57,990 --> 00:55:58,850
That's an anomaly.

1006
00:55:59,430 --> 00:56:00,710
No, no, don't eat your tuna!

1007
00:56:02,550 --> 00:56:04,050
Wait, how do I grab this?

1008
00:56:05,850 --> 00:56:07,470
That's an anomaly right there.

1009
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:18,100
Guys, what is this?

1010
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:19,400
How do I use my scanner?

1011
00:56:24,570 --> 00:56:25,570
What is that?

1012
00:56:26,910 --> 00:56:28,890
How come I can't get my scanner out?

1013
00:56:32,910 --> 00:56:34,770
Oh, get your fucking scanner out!

1014
00:56:37,830 --> 00:56:39,050
Am I scanning it?

1015
00:56:39,970 --> 00:56:40,670
Am I...

1016
00:56:40,670 --> 00:56:41,610
Oh, go back?

1017
00:56:41,730 --> 00:56:42,350
Oh, fuck.

1018
00:56:42,430 --> 00:56:43,470
Oh, I skipped part of the...

1019
00:56:43,470 --> 00:56:43,730
Oh.

1020
00:56:44,210 --> 00:56:44,930
Oh, sorry.

1021
00:56:45,090 --> 00:56:46,370
I like went to step 20.

1022
00:56:50,250 --> 00:56:50,690
Sorry.

1023
00:56:51,790 --> 00:56:52,590
Oh, shit.

1024
00:56:52,630 --> 00:56:53,370
I used my HP.

1025
00:56:53,590 --> 00:56:54,210
Oh, fuck.

1026
00:56:54,210 --> 00:56:55,330
Okay, I'm...

1027
00:56:55,330 --> 00:56:55,970
I went...

1028
00:56:55,970 --> 00:56:57,310
I went to step 20.

1029
00:56:57,510 --> 00:56:57,890
Sorry.

1030
00:57:01,850 --> 00:57:03,070
Do I do this again?

1031
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:08,440
Alright.

1032
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:12,500
What do I do with this?

1033
00:57:17,010 --> 00:57:19,270
Do I drink the forbidden Kool-Aid?

1034
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:26,880
Oh, it's right here.

1035
00:57:27,460 --> 00:57:32,460
Oh, I found it.

1036
00:57:32,460 --> 00:57:32,540
I found it.

1037
00:57:35,140 --> 00:57:35,700
Okay.

1038
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:36,660
You want to...

1039
00:57:36,660 --> 00:57:38,300
You have to place them in specific...

1040
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:41,380
I'm so sorry.

1041
00:57:41,660 --> 00:57:42,600
I'm so sorry.

1042
00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:43,780
What the fuck is that?

1043
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:55,000
Okay.

1044
00:57:56,940 --> 00:57:58,320
Okay, he came back.

1045
00:57:59,360 --> 00:57:59,920
Alright.

1046
00:58:00,580 --> 00:58:01,660
Okay, I...

1047
00:58:01,660 --> 00:58:02,880
I thought he left.

1048
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:05,540
I was like...

1049
00:58:05,540 --> 00:58:05,980
Oh, look.

1050
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:06,540
He left.

1051
00:58:06,540 --> 00:58:06,580
What?

1052
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:10,560
What does it do?

1053
00:58:12,020 --> 00:58:12,500
Drop...

1054
00:58:12,500 --> 00:58:15,560
Your slot quickly hardens for 0.1 seconds.

1055
00:58:16,140 --> 00:58:17,320
Oh, my God.

1056
00:58:20,140 --> 00:58:21,980
No, his butt is pretty flat.

1057
00:58:22,020 --> 00:58:22,600
I'm not gonna lie.

1058
00:58:22,700 --> 00:58:23,860
What the fuck is that?

1059
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:26,680
Holy fuck.

1060
00:58:26,780 --> 00:58:27,020
Okay.

1061
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:27,700
Alright.

1062
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:28,520
Now, I'm...

1063
00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:30,020
Now, we go this way.

1064
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:33,420
Now, I can grab the other artifact.

1065
00:58:34,740 --> 00:58:35,220
Congratulations!

1066
00:58:35,220 --> 00:58:36,460
Welcome to the zone.

1067
00:58:36,580 --> 00:58:38,220
You're now fully certified soccer.

1068
00:58:39,060 --> 00:58:40,220
I have killed your first...

1069
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:41,800
Your...

1070
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:42,100
Oh, wait.

1071
00:58:42,220 --> 00:58:42,480
Nice.

1072
00:58:42,700 --> 00:58:42,980
Scanner.

1073
00:58:44,340 --> 00:58:45,520
First blood sucker.

1074
00:58:45,880 --> 00:58:47,080
Thank you for the super chat.

1075
00:58:47,220 --> 00:58:47,560
Thank you.

1076
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:48,260
Thank you.

1077
00:58:51,580 --> 00:58:52,100
Alright.

1078
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:52,960
Scan.

1079
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:57,100
Yeah, the tutorial is not very intuitive.

1080
00:58:57,580 --> 00:59:00,040
As like a new player...

1081
00:59:00,040 --> 00:59:02,420
It's not as intuitive as I thought.

1082
00:59:02,420 --> 00:59:02,940
But...

1083
00:59:02,940 --> 00:59:05,420
I think like if you played the first soccer, it might be...

1084
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:09,820
You might like sort of know what's going on.

1085
00:59:17,540 --> 00:59:18,620
Step back.

1086
00:59:19,300 --> 00:59:20,360
I already took damage.

1087
00:59:25,570 --> 00:59:26,790
Yeah, I think so.

1088
00:59:27,270 --> 00:59:29,150
There's like electricity all over it.

1089
00:59:29,890 --> 00:59:30,830
It's not?

1090
00:59:36,090 --> 00:59:37,290
Calm down.

1091
00:59:37,590 --> 00:59:39,310
Well, I can charge you the next...

1092
00:59:39,310 --> 00:59:41,090
Heading for the next spot.

1093
00:59:42,810 --> 00:59:43,090
Okay.

1094
00:59:46,970 --> 00:59:48,530
Okay, how the fuck was...

1095
00:59:48,530 --> 00:59:53,710
Okay, let me...

1096
00:59:53,710 --> 00:59:56,410
He said go to the next spot!

1097
01:00:00,030 --> 01:00:02,710
What is not an anomaly here?

1098
01:00:06,470 --> 01:00:06,990
Okay.

1099
01:00:07,230 --> 01:00:08,310
I thought...

1100
01:00:08,310 --> 01:00:09,230
I thought it was friendly.

1101
01:00:11,410 --> 01:00:11,930
Oh.

1102
01:00:12,550 --> 01:00:13,750
Wait, is he friendly?

1103
01:00:15,150 --> 01:00:15,970
Are you a friend?

1104
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:25,840
Not to worry about regular people!

1105
01:00:28,390 --> 01:00:29,350
Guess he was not friendly.

1106
01:00:29,870 --> 01:00:30,810
Guess he was...

1107
01:00:30,810 --> 01:00:32,130
He was not friendly, guys.

1108
01:00:32,590 --> 01:00:33,990
He was absolutely not.

1109
01:00:35,830 --> 01:00:37,990
I thought we're on the same team!

1110
01:00:42,760 --> 01:00:45,040
You mean we're not on the same team?

1111
01:00:47,240 --> 01:00:49,280
Welcome to the zone, baby.

1112
01:00:53,590 --> 01:00:55,110
How do you have so much HP?

1113
01:00:55,290 --> 01:00:55,890
I don't understand!

1114
01:00:56,670 --> 01:00:57,210
I don't...

1115
01:00:57,210 --> 01:00:57,890
He was...

1116
01:00:57,890 --> 01:00:58,670
I don't understand.

1117
01:00:59,090 --> 01:01:00,330
How do you have so much HP?

1118
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:05,860
Okay, one down.

1119
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:08,840
No, he's not.

1120
01:01:10,020 --> 01:01:10,400
Am I...

1121
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:11,180
Am I missing?

1122
01:01:11,620 --> 01:01:16,020
I'm not even...

1123
01:01:18,680 --> 01:01:19,200
Okay.

1124
01:01:19,660 --> 01:01:21,020
Okay, let me...

1125
01:01:21,020 --> 01:01:21,520
Okay.

1126
01:01:22,080 --> 01:01:23,160
Am I even hitting?

1127
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:25,220
Okay, let me...

1128
01:01:25,540 --> 01:01:26,120
Let me...

1129
01:01:26,120 --> 01:01:27,020
Guys, check...

1130
01:01:27,020 --> 01:01:27,640
Let me check my gun.

1131
01:01:27,800 --> 01:01:28,660
Let me...

1132
01:01:29,660 --> 01:01:31,000
Check my gun.

1133
01:01:32,340 --> 01:01:32,840
Where is he?

1134
01:01:35,640 --> 01:01:36,520
Did I hit him?

1135
01:01:40,020 --> 01:01:40,260
No.

1136
01:01:41,880 --> 01:01:43,060
No, no, you don't.

1137
01:01:48,830 --> 01:01:50,850
I lost these guns!

1138
01:01:51,870 --> 01:01:52,430
Please!

1139
01:01:54,070 --> 01:01:56,250
This is my first fight!

1140
01:01:59,900 --> 01:02:00,280
Alright.

1141
01:02:00,700 --> 01:02:02,000
Oh, that was a grenade?

1142
01:02:02,540 --> 01:02:02,880
Okay.

1143
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:04,360
Alright.

1144
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:05,900
Now, at least I can steal his stuff.

1145
01:02:05,980 --> 01:02:07,320
Okay, he used everything.

1146
01:02:07,980 --> 01:02:08,900
I literally...

1147
01:02:08,900 --> 01:02:10,880
That was the longest fight of his life.

1148
01:02:11,880 --> 01:02:14,880
He used all his fucking weapons.

1149
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:16,980
Oh my god, at least he has...

1150
01:02:16,980 --> 01:02:17,740
Okay, thank god.

1151
01:02:17,780 --> 01:02:19,360
Okay, he has...

1152
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:20,200
Oh, thank god.

1153
01:02:20,260 --> 01:02:20,560
Okay.

1154
01:02:20,760 --> 01:02:21,520
I'm just gonna use this gun.

1155
01:02:21,560 --> 01:02:22,440
This gun is a lot better.

1156
01:02:22,940 --> 01:02:25,880
This is a lot better.

1157
01:02:28,340 --> 01:02:29,460
Here's some radiation.

1158
01:02:31,620 --> 01:02:32,760
Don't be that bad.

1159
01:02:33,720 --> 01:02:35,120
Wait, there might be stuff over here.

1160
01:02:40,040 --> 01:02:40,400
Hello?

1161
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:46,040
Hello?

1162
01:02:47,820 --> 01:02:48,580
Hello?

1163
01:02:52,820 --> 01:02:54,420
Oh, wait, it's floating!

1164
01:02:55,940 --> 01:02:57,580
Why is it floating?

1165
01:03:00,300 --> 01:03:00,580
Okay.

1166
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:08,800
What hit me?

1167
01:03:11,580 --> 01:03:13,660
What the fuck is hitting me?

1168
01:03:18,990 --> 01:03:20,510
There's poltergeists!

1169
01:03:20,770 --> 01:03:22,550
What is wrong with this area?

1170
01:03:25,540 --> 01:03:26,560
Oh my god, please.

1171
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:27,800
Please, I'm just...

1172
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:28,740
Just...

1173
01:03:28,740 --> 01:03:31,680
I'm just trying to steal your stuff.

1174
01:03:39,840 --> 01:03:42,160
Wait, I don't...

1175
01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:43,860
I didn't save any.

1176
01:03:49,660 --> 01:03:52,540
Oh my god, are you fucking...

1177
01:03:52,540 --> 01:03:54,540
Where was the last save?

1178
01:03:56,300 --> 01:03:57,280
Where am I?

1179
01:03:58,780 --> 01:04:00,160
Wait, where was this?

1180
01:04:01,060 --> 01:04:02,780
Oh, this is where I killed those two men.

1181
01:04:03,740 --> 01:04:05,080
Do I still have their stuff?

1182
01:04:07,140 --> 01:04:08,480
Wait, no, I don't.

1183
01:04:10,180 --> 01:04:11,460
Wait, I don't have their stuff.

1184
01:04:13,900 --> 01:04:15,580
I guess they're dead?

1185
01:04:17,300 --> 01:04:18,540
I guess they despawned.

1186
01:04:20,320 --> 01:04:21,400
Bye now.

1187
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:24,600
Okay, so there's poltergeists now.

1188
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:27,420
Oh my god.

1189
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:28,080
Like, what?

1190
01:04:28,320 --> 01:04:29,900
There's so many things.

1191
01:04:29,980 --> 01:04:32,420
I didn't know Chernobyl can do all that.

1192
01:04:41,140 --> 01:04:41,660
Hello?

1193
01:04:47,040 --> 01:04:47,820
What's that?

1194
01:04:48,260 --> 01:04:49,060
Do you think they know?

1195
01:04:49,420 --> 01:04:50,280
He knows, he knows!

1196
01:04:58,470 --> 01:04:59,330
He knew.

1197
01:05:01,150 --> 01:05:01,410
He...

1198
01:05:05,090 --> 01:05:06,230
He knew.

1199
01:05:07,350 --> 01:05:08,270
I...

1200
01:05:09,030 --> 01:05:10,510
I didn't...

1201
01:05:10,570 --> 01:05:12,370
I didn't...

1202
01:05:14,150 --> 01:05:15,450
Didn't even...

1203
01:05:15,610 --> 01:05:17,670
I don't understand.

1204
01:05:19,690 --> 01:05:21,470
I didn't even...

1205
01:05:23,150 --> 01:05:26,230
I didn't even make noise.

1206
01:05:26,370 --> 01:05:27,790
I don't understand.

1207
01:05:27,790 --> 01:05:28,590
I don't understand.

1208
01:05:29,390 --> 01:05:31,710
How do I do this?

1209
01:05:33,570 --> 01:05:38,030
Okay, now this is where you forgot to take my anti-radiation meds.

1210
01:05:38,690 --> 01:05:40,310
I don't understand.

1211
01:05:44,020 --> 01:05:45,420
I was quiet.

1212
01:05:45,640 --> 01:05:46,540
I was so quiet.

1213
01:05:46,580 --> 01:05:47,300
I'm gonna save.

1214
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:49,140
I'm gonna save.

1215
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:53,320
Okay.

1216
01:05:53,980 --> 01:05:54,660
I'm just gonna run.

1217
01:05:55,760 --> 01:05:57,520
Alright, is the loot even good enough?

1218
01:05:57,940 --> 01:05:58,540
Guys?

1219
01:06:00,660 --> 01:06:02,640
Is it even worth it, guys?

1220
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:03,280
Oh, shit.

1221
01:06:03,520 --> 01:06:04,200
Wrong one.

1222
01:06:09,620 --> 01:06:10,260
Is it?

1223
01:06:14,750 --> 01:06:15,350
Alright,

1224
01:06:24,890 --> 01:06:25,190
okay.

1225
01:06:25,290 --> 01:06:25,830
I'm gonna save.

1226
01:06:26,310 --> 01:06:26,610
Alright.

1227
01:06:27,870 --> 01:06:28,610
One life.

1228
01:06:31,230 --> 01:06:32,810
We're gonna one-life this.

1229
01:06:34,970 --> 01:06:35,350
Okay.

1230
01:06:38,170 --> 01:06:41,190
Can't chase me if I run fast enough.

1231
01:06:42,730 --> 01:06:43,410
Okay, guys.

1232
01:06:43,530 --> 01:06:43,850
I...

1233
01:06:43,850 --> 01:06:44,350
Okay.

1234
01:06:45,090 --> 01:06:45,450
Okay.

1235
01:06:45,770 --> 01:06:46,090
Okay.

1236
01:06:47,490 --> 01:06:49,530
Is he gonna go throw that box?

1237
01:06:49,630 --> 01:06:50,150
Okay, guys.

1238
01:06:50,210 --> 01:06:50,730
Never mind.

1239
01:06:50,870 --> 01:06:52,210
This is not the way.

1240
01:06:53,690 --> 01:06:56,050
Can't chase me if I...

1241
01:06:56,050 --> 01:06:56,610
Okay.

1242
01:06:56,810 --> 01:06:57,070
Alright.

1243
01:06:57,170 --> 01:06:57,630
It's okay.

1244
01:06:57,830 --> 01:06:59,150
We'll wait for him to throw.

1245
01:07:01,450 --> 01:07:01,950
Alright.

1246
01:07:02,170 --> 01:07:03,150
I'm climbing up.

1247
01:07:03,150 --> 01:07:04,610
Climbing up.

1248
01:07:07,010 --> 01:07:08,570
Okay, there you go.

1249
01:07:08,750 --> 01:07:09,290
That's right.

1250
01:07:09,350 --> 01:07:10,310
What you gonna do?

1251
01:07:10,870 --> 01:07:12,270
Fucking nothing!

1252
01:07:19,180 --> 01:07:19,980
Sorry.

1253
01:07:21,080 --> 01:07:22,640
That's what he's gonna...

1254
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:24,040
I don't know.

1255
01:07:26,920 --> 01:07:28,160
Oh, shit!

1256
01:07:31,080 --> 01:07:32,740
He did something.

1257
01:07:33,140 --> 01:07:33,860
I didn't...

1258
01:07:33,860 --> 01:07:34,720
I didn't know.

1259
01:07:35,120 --> 01:07:35,560
I...

1260
01:07:35,560 --> 01:07:37,020
I didn't know!

1261
01:07:37,600 --> 01:07:38,020
Oh!

1262
01:07:38,020 --> 01:07:38,580
Okay.

1263
01:07:38,780 --> 01:07:39,420
We're fine.

1264
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:41,680
I...

1265
01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:43,660
I thought he was the friendly ones!

1266
01:07:43,700 --> 01:07:43,980
You know?

1267
01:07:44,040 --> 01:07:45,260
The one where you can touch?

1268
01:07:45,800 --> 01:07:46,320
Oh, my God.

1269
01:07:46,340 --> 01:07:47,420
How do I get down from here?

1270
01:07:48,240 --> 01:07:48,580
Okay.

1271
01:07:48,900 --> 01:07:49,500
It's fine.

1272
01:07:49,540 --> 01:07:49,920
We did it.

1273
01:07:49,960 --> 01:07:50,880
We got the loot.

1274
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:53,660
Wait, I can kill it?

1275
01:07:53,880 --> 01:07:54,680
Oh, it's over.

1276
01:07:55,440 --> 01:07:56,480
Oh, it's not over.

1277
01:07:56,560 --> 01:07:57,780
He got a fucking barrel.

1278
01:07:58,220 --> 01:07:58,500
Alright.

1279
01:07:58,560 --> 01:07:58,920
It's fine.

1280
01:07:59,020 --> 01:07:59,340
We'll leave.

1281
01:07:59,400 --> 01:07:59,740
We'll leave.

1282
01:07:59,820 --> 01:08:00,140
We'll leave.

1283
01:08:00,220 --> 01:08:00,580
He...

1284
01:08:00,580 --> 01:08:01,320
You know...

1285
01:08:01,320 --> 01:08:04,740
I know Casper is pissed.

1286
01:08:06,200 --> 01:08:06,600
Okay.

1287
01:08:06,600 --> 01:08:07,080
I...

1288
01:08:07,080 --> 01:08:08,300
I know when...

1289
01:08:08,300 --> 01:08:08,520
You know?

1290
01:08:08,620 --> 01:08:10,420
I know when, like, I should go.

1291
01:08:10,860 --> 01:08:11,300
I...

1292
01:08:12,060 --> 01:08:12,500
I...

1293
01:08:12,500 --> 01:08:13,340
Like...

1294
01:08:13,340 --> 01:08:14,420
It's a ghost.

1295
01:08:14,500 --> 01:08:15,300
What is he gonna drop?

1296
01:08:15,360 --> 01:08:16,860
He's not gonna drop anything, guys.

1297
01:08:16,920 --> 01:08:18,320
It's literally a fucking ghost.

1298
01:08:18,660 --> 01:08:20,020
What's the point of killing him?

1299
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:23,960
Okay.

1300
01:08:24,160 --> 01:08:26,020
I got anti-radiation drugs.

1301
01:08:32,640 --> 01:08:33,480
For pri...

1302
01:08:33,480 --> 01:08:34,560
No, I know...

1303
01:08:34,560 --> 01:08:34,960
You know?

1304
01:08:35,040 --> 01:08:36,320
I know when I'm beat.

1305
01:08:36,440 --> 01:08:36,800
I...

1306
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:37,300
I...

1307
01:08:37,300 --> 01:08:37,420
I...

1308
01:08:37,420 --> 01:08:37,680
I...

1309
01:08:41,480 --> 01:08:41,960
Okay.

1310
01:08:42,100 --> 01:08:42,140
Wait.

1311
01:08:42,200 --> 01:08:42,760
Let me...

1312
01:08:42,760 --> 01:08:44,020
Guys, I'm paranoid now.

1313
01:08:44,100 --> 01:08:46,400
I can't save it, because I'm too busy doing this.

1314
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:49,360
Woo!

1315
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:51,440
Alright.

1316
01:08:51,560 --> 01:08:51,880
Save.

1317
01:08:53,220 --> 01:08:55,280
I could've done F5, but, like...

1318
01:08:55,280 --> 01:08:56,660
I know this pisses you guys more.

1319
01:08:57,100 --> 01:08:57,580
More.

1320
01:08:58,580 --> 01:08:59,020
Alright.

1321
01:08:59,280 --> 01:09:00,020
Can't be that bad.

1322
01:09:00,360 --> 01:09:00,940
I did it.

1323
01:09:04,790 --> 01:09:05,270
Oh!

1324
01:09:06,990 --> 01:09:07,470
Okay.

1325
01:09:07,550 --> 01:09:08,870
That would've been really bad.

1326
01:09:10,510 --> 01:09:10,990
Okay.

1327
01:09:12,390 --> 01:09:15,110
That would've been actually really fucking bad.

1328
01:09:18,370 --> 01:09:18,850
Alright.

1329
01:09:19,090 --> 01:09:19,430
Nice.

1330
01:09:19,810 --> 01:09:20,370
I took it.

1331
01:09:26,090 --> 01:09:28,530
I feel like everything is an anomaly at this point.

1332
01:09:28,630 --> 01:09:29,590
Like, what is an anomaly?

1333
01:09:33,050 --> 01:09:35,190
Like, do I have anything that's not an anomaly?

1334
01:09:35,210 --> 01:09:36,290
Guys, you can't just say...

1335
01:09:36,290 --> 01:09:39,150
You can't say, like, anything you see is an anomaly.

1336
01:09:40,290 --> 01:09:42,290
The more damage you take...

1337
01:09:43,150 --> 01:09:44,850
But what's the radiation part?

1338
01:09:46,210 --> 01:09:47,770
Guys, a little radiation doesn't hurt.

1339
01:09:47,970 --> 01:09:48,190
See?

1340
01:09:48,250 --> 01:09:50,510
If I run past it, it should be fine.

1341
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:02,560
Wait, somebody died here.

1342
01:10:07,440 --> 01:10:08,960
Another person died here.

1343
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:12,040
But how do I treat this?

1344
01:10:13,220 --> 01:10:16,020
Guys, what do I press to treat my radiation issue?

1345
01:10:18,100 --> 01:10:19,420
There's so many now.

1346
01:10:19,560 --> 01:10:20,660
What is an anomaly?

1347
01:10:21,320 --> 01:10:23,240
I feel like everything...

1348
01:10:23,240 --> 01:10:25,640
If everything is an anomaly, then nothing...

1349
01:10:25,640 --> 01:10:28,080
Then everything is considered normal at this point.

1350
01:10:28,940 --> 01:10:30,100
Time will heal.

1351
01:10:31,720 --> 01:10:32,380
It's alright.

1352
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:35,260
People see sparks all the time.

1353
01:10:38,360 --> 01:10:40,260
Time will heal itself, right?

1354
01:10:40,600 --> 01:10:42,860
Wait, does vodka heal...

1355
01:10:45,150 --> 01:10:46,210
Does it actually?

1356
01:10:46,470 --> 01:10:48,310
Oh my god, I fucking knew it.

1357
01:10:48,430 --> 01:10:49,210
Just keep drinking.

1358
01:10:51,250 --> 01:10:53,770
I knew my doctors were wrong.

1359
01:10:54,370 --> 01:10:59,030
I knew my therapist was wrong when she said it's...

1360
01:10:59,030 --> 01:11:00,550
When she said I should stop.

1361
01:11:01,310 --> 01:11:02,330
Okay, obviously.

1362
01:11:02,890 --> 01:11:04,270
How do I get through this?

1363
01:11:04,990 --> 01:11:06,050
The window over here.

1364
01:11:08,230 --> 01:11:11,070
It's technically water if you think about it.

1365
01:11:13,070 --> 01:11:15,310
Okay, let's grab...

1366
01:11:15,310 --> 01:11:17,370
Some ammo, some bandages.

1367
01:11:18,050 --> 01:11:19,210
Oh, more vodka.

1368
01:11:19,790 --> 01:11:20,430
More medicine.

1369
01:11:21,810 --> 01:11:22,730
I think I see anomaly.

1370
01:11:22,990 --> 01:11:25,450
There's this really cute blonde girl on the right.

1371
01:11:25,850 --> 01:11:27,530
Thank you for the super chat, Kensei.

1372
01:11:27,590 --> 01:11:28,690
Thank you, thank you.

1373
01:11:29,650 --> 01:11:31,870
At this point, everything is anomaly.

1374
01:11:33,170 --> 01:11:36,030
If everything is anomaly, then everything is normal.

1375
01:11:36,030 --> 01:11:37,410
Wait, here?

1376
01:11:38,050 --> 01:11:39,070
That's the water.

1377
01:11:42,070 --> 01:11:42,850
It's like here.

1378
01:11:46,700 --> 01:11:48,300
It's like right here?

1379
01:11:49,240 --> 01:11:52,160
Oh no, I feel like I should not touch the water.

1380
01:11:53,160 --> 01:11:54,080
Oh, wait.

1381
01:11:56,180 --> 01:11:57,280
Wait a minute.

1382
01:11:57,280 --> 01:11:57,500
Wait a minute.

1383
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:08,540
Oh, wait a minute.

1384
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:10,400
Maybe I can come...

1385
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:11,860
Oh, thank God.

1386
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:13,640
Okay, I can go back up.

1387
01:12:13,740 --> 01:12:13,920
Okay.

1388
01:12:14,200 --> 01:12:18,520
I thought I fucked up a little bit, but that's okay.

1389
01:12:18,580 --> 01:12:19,460
Never punished.

1390
01:12:20,340 --> 01:12:21,540
Never punished.

1391
01:12:23,240 --> 01:12:24,440
But where...

1392
01:12:24,440 --> 01:12:25,300
Where is it?

1393
01:12:27,280 --> 01:12:28,680
Oh, it's literally right here.

1394
01:12:29,340 --> 01:12:30,860
I did not see this.

1395
01:12:33,740 --> 01:12:35,800
Such is the life in the zone.

1396
01:12:36,180 --> 01:12:37,960
Airborne, thank you for the super chat.

1397
01:12:38,060 --> 01:12:39,220
Thank you, thank you.

1398
01:12:41,380 --> 01:12:42,320
Okay, nice.

1399
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:43,300
We did it.

1400
01:12:45,480 --> 01:12:46,860
Should be the last one.

1401
01:12:51,910 --> 01:12:53,510
Well, cutscene me is a lot smarter.

1402
01:13:02,810 --> 01:13:03,290
Nice.

1403
01:13:04,390 --> 01:13:05,270
Can I scan everything?

1404
01:13:07,970 --> 01:13:08,770
Oh.

1405
01:13:31,160 --> 01:13:35,340
Aren't they ever tired of just fucking calling everything an anomaly?

1406
01:13:35,880 --> 01:13:37,180
I'm fucking tired.

1407
01:13:38,940 --> 01:13:42,100
Anomaly this, anomaly that.

1408
01:13:42,580 --> 01:13:43,280
When is it...

1409
01:13:43,280 --> 01:13:43,920
Oh, shit!

1410
01:13:45,680 --> 01:13:47,060
Oh, fuck.

1411
01:13:47,160 --> 01:13:48,140
Is that anomaly?

1412
01:13:51,560 --> 01:13:54,600
Is that also an anomaly?

1413
01:14:04,490 --> 01:14:06,410
Boy, it's anomaly.

1414
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:18,720
He sold us out?

1415
01:14:19,640 --> 01:14:22,340
I can't believe the guy I just met betrayed me.

1416
01:14:23,820 --> 01:14:24,620
Hello?

1417
01:14:25,380 --> 01:14:26,160
Are you anomaly?

1418
01:14:26,160 --> 01:14:27,120
Are they?

1419
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:32,120
Are they anomaly?

1420
01:14:33,180 --> 01:14:34,560
Are they anomalies?

1421
01:14:40,660 --> 01:14:45,340
Maybe the anomalies are just the friends we made along the way.

1422
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:47,240
Thank you for the super chat.

1423
01:14:47,320 --> 01:14:48,500
Thank you, thank you.

1424
01:14:49,960 --> 01:14:51,120
Oh, shit!

1425
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:55,160
Guys, it only took me 40 minutes to finish the tutorial.

1426
01:14:55,800 --> 01:14:56,500
It only...

1427
01:14:59,720 --> 01:15:00,640
I did it.

1428
01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:02,280
Are you anomaly?

1429
01:15:03,860 --> 01:15:05,560
That has to be anomaly.

1430
01:15:05,700 --> 01:15:05,920
No!

1431
01:15:06,140 --> 01:15:07,100
Don't shoot the guy!

1432
01:15:07,880 --> 01:15:08,240
No!

1433
01:15:08,780 --> 01:15:09,880
He's just trying...

1434
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:12,340
He's just trying to give a good lick.

1435
01:15:14,680 --> 01:15:15,960
Oh, shit!

1436
01:15:17,720 --> 01:15:17,900
Oh!

1437
01:15:33,970 --> 01:15:34,690
Richard.

1438
01:15:36,550 --> 01:15:36,950
What?

1439
01:15:36,950 --> 01:15:37,110
What?

1440
01:15:37,570 --> 01:15:38,610
What's this?

1441
01:15:39,810 --> 01:15:40,710
Yeah, why would I need a ball?

1442
01:15:41,690 --> 01:15:44,150
That happened to my dog once.

1443
01:15:53,380 --> 01:15:54,100
What?

1444
01:15:55,260 --> 01:15:56,280
Tosses to anomaly?

1445
01:15:57,760 --> 01:15:58,480
What?

1446
01:15:59,280 --> 01:16:00,760
Why do they hate balls?

1447
01:16:02,140 --> 01:16:04,760
Determine its boundaries and even temp...

1448
01:16:04,760 --> 01:16:07,020
Use tab and select the ball.

1449
01:16:08,180 --> 01:16:09,020
Okay.

1450
01:16:17,270 --> 01:16:18,110
Okay,

1451
01:16:21,370 --> 01:16:22,610
I neutralized it.

1452
01:16:24,370 --> 01:16:25,530
I'm sorry!

1453
01:16:25,770 --> 01:16:26,270
I'm sorry!

1454
01:16:27,070 --> 01:16:29,390
Guys, I did not neutralize it.

1455
01:16:33,130 --> 01:16:34,570
Guys, I did...

1456
01:16:37,370 --> 01:16:39,870
I did not neutralize.

1457
01:16:40,030 --> 01:16:40,470
What?

1458
01:16:47,910 --> 01:16:48,310
Okay.

1459
01:16:51,950 --> 01:16:53,670
Oh, my God!

1460
01:16:53,870 --> 01:16:55,330
You mean it's timed?

1461
01:16:56,010 --> 01:16:56,670
I thought...

1462
01:16:57,130 --> 01:16:58,690
Oh, I thought it was...

1463
01:16:58,690 --> 01:16:59,330
I thought...

1464
01:16:59,330 --> 01:17:00,170
I thought...

1465
01:17:00,170 --> 01:17:01,230
I didn't realize...

1466
01:17:01,850 --> 01:17:03,830
I didn't realize it's timed.

1467
01:17:04,270 --> 01:17:05,190
I was like...

1468
01:17:05,190 --> 01:17:06,230
Okay, I'm just gonna...

1469
01:17:07,330 --> 01:17:07,750
Okay.

1470
01:17:08,570 --> 01:17:11,690
I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running.

1471
01:17:13,930 --> 01:17:14,690
That's right.

1472
01:17:15,170 --> 01:17:15,830
First try.

1473
01:17:17,410 --> 01:17:19,110
Guys, it was first try, guys.

1474
01:17:19,370 --> 01:17:20,370
It was first try.

1475
01:17:26,150 --> 01:17:27,890
Molly, thank you for the super chat.

1476
01:17:28,130 --> 01:17:30,070
See, he knew I could do it, guys.

1477
01:17:30,130 --> 01:17:31,310
He believed in me.

1478
01:17:34,470 --> 01:17:35,950
I was attacked.

1479
01:17:42,230 --> 01:17:43,790
He knows nothing but my birthday suit.

1480
01:17:54,030 --> 01:17:55,390
The bartender?

1481
01:17:55,650 --> 01:17:56,250
Why is...

1482
01:17:56,250 --> 01:17:56,570
What?

1483
01:18:01,100 --> 01:18:04,160
Why is a bartender still living in the zone?

1484
01:18:04,580 --> 01:18:06,240
What kind of money will you...

1485
01:18:06,240 --> 01:18:06,440
What?

1486
01:18:06,620 --> 01:18:07,220
Move!

1487
01:18:07,580 --> 01:18:08,500
Just move!

1488
01:18:09,040 --> 01:18:11,280
Just move!

1489
01:18:15,900 --> 01:18:17,060
Is he...

1490
01:18:17,060 --> 01:18:20,100
Who's not an anomaly at this point?

1491
01:18:23,240 --> 01:18:25,480
I should be allowed to grab a sign.

1492
01:18:31,580 --> 01:18:33,000
Wait, there's some vodka.

1493
01:18:36,340 --> 01:18:36,920
Okay.

1494
01:18:37,420 --> 01:18:38,320
Wait, there's loot.

1495
01:18:38,740 --> 01:18:39,740
Okay, there's no loot.

1496
01:18:46,580 --> 01:18:48,440
Wait, oh no, I was here.

1497
01:19:06,100 --> 01:19:06,540
What?

1498
01:19:10,500 --> 01:19:11,320
I'm not special?

1499
01:19:11,420 --> 01:19:12,380
Yeah, who are you?

1500
01:19:14,360 --> 01:19:15,420
Who are you?

1501
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,480
You took tour guides for zones?

1502
01:19:29,940 --> 01:19:31,840
Oh my god.

1503
01:19:32,900 --> 01:19:33,560
He's a stalker.

1504
01:19:42,020 --> 01:19:44,440
Get away from him, he's a stalker!

1505
01:19:44,680 --> 01:19:45,900
He's gonna dox you!

1506
01:19:48,580 --> 01:19:50,380
They tried to resist, but...

1507
01:19:50,820 --> 01:19:53,000
Caution of put them in their place quick enough.

1508
01:19:53,840 --> 01:19:56,760
He made sure they wouldn't mess with the new world order.

1509
01:19:57,380 --> 01:19:59,460
Anyway, stay away from the ward.

1510
01:20:00,280 --> 01:20:03,040
And don't mention this around them, obviously.

1511
01:20:04,060 --> 01:20:06,320
Oh yeah, they're like, stay away from them!

1512
01:20:06,620 --> 01:20:07,280
And then...

1513
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:10,100
And then, and then like you're like...

1514
01:20:10,100 --> 01:20:11,860
I'm gonna do it!

1515
01:20:14,960 --> 01:20:16,180
It's always like that.

1516
01:20:16,320 --> 01:20:17,240
Stay away from him.

1517
01:20:17,240 --> 01:20:17,680
JK!

1518
01:20:18,700 --> 01:20:20,340
That means I should get close.

1519
01:20:23,560 --> 01:20:25,220
Okay, yeah, why are you helping me?

1520
01:20:26,260 --> 01:20:28,160
Or am I somehow special?

1521
01:20:29,800 --> 01:20:31,220
To quote my fictional dad...

1522
01:20:31,880 --> 01:20:34,040
Son, help if you can.

1523
01:20:34,240 --> 01:20:36,800
And if you can, don't get in the way.

1524
01:20:38,260 --> 01:20:39,840
So, don't get in the way.

1525
01:20:40,700 --> 01:20:42,140
Or help if you will.

1526
01:20:43,020 --> 01:20:44,520
My men at the post office need a hand.

1527
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:47,080
Bring them a couple of medkits.

1528
01:20:47,980 --> 01:20:50,280
You'll be able to make some friends, maybe.

1529
01:20:55,400 --> 01:20:55,840
Make some friends!

1530
01:20:57,660 --> 01:21:01,180
Okay, we gotta go to meet...

1531
01:21:01,180 --> 01:21:02,140
Go to the bar.

1532
01:21:04,940 --> 01:21:06,740
Guys, we're gonna make some friends.

1533
01:21:07,800 --> 01:21:10,100
We're totally not gonna try and kill me.

1534
01:21:13,460 --> 01:21:13,880
Nice.

1535
01:21:15,240 --> 01:21:16,400
Okay, gotta get all of this.

1536
01:21:16,460 --> 01:21:19,400
I wish there was an easier way to take all the loot.

1537
01:21:19,540 --> 01:21:20,560
I don't wanna like right click.

1538
01:21:21,200 --> 01:21:22,340
I just wanna take all...

1539
01:21:22,340 --> 01:21:24,680
I'm pretty sure there is and you guys are just gonna...

1540
01:21:32,260 --> 01:21:33,820
Okay, so there's that.

1541
01:21:35,120 --> 01:21:36,360
Open the map.

1542
01:21:37,200 --> 01:21:38,260
What's the map say?

1543
01:21:39,400 --> 01:21:40,560
What the fuck?

1544
01:21:40,680 --> 01:21:41,400
Wait, what's this?

1545
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:45,920
What is this?

1546
01:21:49,560 --> 01:21:50,920
Okay, uh...

1547
01:21:50,920 --> 01:21:52,200
What's that question mark?

1548
01:21:52,700 --> 01:21:54,140
Information about all active.

1549
01:21:54,380 --> 01:21:56,680
Use Q and E to navigate the PDA.

1550
01:21:57,360 --> 01:21:58,040
Okay.

1551
01:21:58,720 --> 01:21:59,360
What is this?

1552
01:21:59,420 --> 01:22:00,460
What's the question mark?

1553
01:22:05,800 --> 01:22:07,560
Oh my...

1554
01:22:08,500 --> 01:22:11,020
And there is a fog too?

1555
01:22:13,100 --> 01:22:14,740
This is me.

1556
01:22:18,340 --> 01:22:19,600
This is me.

1557
01:22:22,340 --> 01:22:25,740
And this is the rest of the world.

1558
01:22:27,780 --> 01:22:29,720
Welcome to the zone.

1559
01:22:30,600 --> 01:22:33,320
I'm in the lesser zone because I'm lesser I guess.

1560
01:22:33,820 --> 01:22:35,340
What's the question mark?

1561
01:22:37,320 --> 01:22:39,120
Yeah, I heard this is an open world.

1562
01:22:39,980 --> 01:22:40,640
That's a little me.

1563
01:22:44,720 --> 01:22:46,260
Alright, do you think there's bus...

1564
01:22:46,260 --> 01:22:47,720
Do you think there's actually a bus stop?

1565
01:22:52,640 --> 01:22:54,760
Are you guys good people?

1566
01:22:55,860 --> 01:22:56,900
Hey guys.

1567
01:22:59,160 --> 01:23:00,580
Oh, he's not good.

1568
01:23:00,580 --> 01:23:01,660
He's not a good person.

1569
01:23:04,480 --> 01:23:06,520
Oh, is he gonna do run after me?

1570
01:23:09,460 --> 01:23:10,020
Hello?

1571
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:16,240
How is there fighting?

1572
01:23:16,380 --> 01:23:16,920
I'm nothing!

1573
01:23:18,320 --> 01:23:19,420
Oh, I'm gonna leave.

1574
01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:20,260
Fuck this.

1575
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:23,300
You can handle this yourself.

1576
01:23:27,950 --> 01:23:29,170
What do you mean?

1577
01:23:29,390 --> 01:23:29,570
What?

1578
01:23:29,750 --> 01:23:29,910
Oh.

1579
01:23:30,930 --> 01:23:31,250
Gun.

1580
01:23:31,930 --> 01:23:33,150
I was like, what gun?

1581
01:23:37,020 --> 01:23:38,280
There you go.

1582
01:23:38,280 --> 01:23:38,800
Gun.

1583
01:23:41,620 --> 01:23:42,960
Alright, gun down.

1584
01:23:44,500 --> 01:23:45,540
Okay, we got gun.

1585
01:23:46,700 --> 01:23:48,400
Okay, I didn't realize I had a gun.

1586
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:50,080
I thought they took everything.

1587
01:23:50,340 --> 01:23:50,660
Woah!

1588
01:23:53,280 --> 01:23:54,980
I thought they took everything!

1589
01:23:56,380 --> 01:23:58,040
Oh, I'm still reloading!

1590
01:24:01,640 --> 01:24:02,160
Okay.

1591
01:24:02,160 --> 01:24:03,600
One down.

1592
01:24:09,080 --> 01:24:10,840
I'm trying to headshot!

1593
01:24:16,160 --> 01:24:16,720
How?

1594
01:24:16,960 --> 01:24:17,460
How?

1595
01:24:17,720 --> 01:24:19,060
What armor are you wearing?

1596
01:24:19,680 --> 01:24:20,180
How?

1597
01:24:22,520 --> 01:24:24,940
What is this armor that you have?

1598
01:24:28,770 --> 01:24:29,310
Okay.

1599
01:24:30,550 --> 01:24:32,170
At least I have a shotgun now.

1600
01:24:36,980 --> 01:24:38,640
Okay, I want to loot...

1601
01:24:38,640 --> 01:24:40,260
Where are the other bodies that I killed?

1602
01:24:40,360 --> 01:24:41,020
Oh, there it is.

1603
01:24:42,160 --> 01:24:44,120
Okay, he has so much ammo.

1604
01:24:45,360 --> 01:24:46,380
So good.

1605
01:24:48,020 --> 01:24:48,540
Okay.

1606
01:24:49,780 --> 01:24:51,020
He had two shotguns.

1607
01:24:52,600 --> 01:24:53,940
I have nades.

1608
01:24:54,040 --> 01:24:54,960
I wonder if there's like an...

1609
01:24:54,960 --> 01:24:55,680
Oh, wait, is that?

1610
01:24:57,120 --> 01:24:58,120
Wait, what gun is this?

1611
01:24:59,240 --> 01:24:59,580
Okay.

1612
01:24:59,920 --> 01:25:00,720
Thank God.

1613
01:25:00,820 --> 01:25:01,100
Wait!

1614
01:25:01,540 --> 01:25:03,340
They can...

1615
01:25:03,340 --> 01:25:05,340
There's durability?!

1616
01:25:05,340 --> 01:25:06,360
God fucking...

1617
01:25:06,360 --> 01:25:06,600
Okay.

1618
01:25:08,380 --> 01:25:10,660
Oh, R is take- Oh, thank God.

1619
01:25:10,660 --> 01:25:11,120
Okay.

1620
01:25:11,280 --> 01:25:11,820
Alright.

1621
01:25:12,040 --> 01:25:12,600
Thank God!

1622
01:25:13,160 --> 01:25:13,980
Now I can...

1623
01:25:14,440 --> 01:25:16,120
Now I can look less stupid.

1624
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,540
Now I can look less stupid.

1625
01:25:23,240 --> 01:25:23,680
Yay!

1626
01:25:24,860 --> 01:25:28,060
My dragoons can stop making fun of me.

1627
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,380
Why are they trying to shoot anyway?

1628
01:25:33,480 --> 01:25:34,200
Oh yeah, we should save.

1629
01:25:34,520 --> 01:25:35,280
Is it F5?

1630
01:25:36,500 --> 01:25:37,720
Yeah, I saved it.

1631
01:25:40,660 --> 01:25:41,540
They're here.

1632
01:25:44,340 --> 01:25:45,900
Man, I wish I could read that.

1633
01:25:48,980 --> 01:25:49,540
Oh!

1634
01:25:50,560 --> 01:25:51,880
This is safe water.

1635
01:25:53,080 --> 01:25:53,640
Finally!

1636
01:25:54,820 --> 01:25:56,360
This is not safe water.

1637
01:25:57,660 --> 01:25:58,780
This is...

1638
01:25:58,780 --> 01:25:59,840
This is not...

1639
01:26:00,360 --> 01:26:01,660
Wait, there was a dude there?!

1640
01:26:04,060 --> 01:26:05,160
It's fine.

1641
01:26:05,300 --> 01:26:06,220
I have vodka.

1642
01:26:07,500 --> 01:26:09,200
I didn't even see the guy in there.

1643
01:26:11,020 --> 01:26:12,200
Is there a guy here?

1644
01:26:13,440 --> 01:26:14,160
Oh, guys.

1645
01:26:14,300 --> 01:26:14,720
I'm not...

1646
01:26:14,720 --> 01:26:15,720
I'm feeling a little...

1647
01:26:15,720 --> 01:26:16,840
I'm feeling a little weird.

1648
01:26:19,240 --> 01:26:21,820
Toki, that sign says danger.

1649
01:26:23,260 --> 01:26:24,900
God, I knew you said I wish I could read.

1650
01:26:25,020 --> 01:26:26,200
How was I supposed to know?

1651
01:26:26,380 --> 01:26:27,380
How was I supposed to know?

1652
01:26:27,440 --> 01:26:28,600
Does it look like I can read?

1653
01:26:28,900 --> 01:26:30,460
I can barely read English!

1654
01:26:34,470 --> 01:26:35,750
Where's the guy I saved?

1655
01:26:36,250 --> 01:26:36,610
Where...

1656
01:26:38,790 --> 01:26:39,390
Oh wait, no.

1657
01:26:39,430 --> 01:26:40,310
They shot him here.

1658
01:26:40,850 --> 01:26:41,970
I forgot it was right here.

1659
01:26:43,650 --> 01:26:44,530
Oh, there you are.

1660
01:26:45,090 --> 01:26:45,450
Hello.

1661
01:26:48,130 --> 01:26:48,490
Answer.

1662
01:26:49,850 --> 01:26:50,890
Thank you for the super chat.

1663
01:26:50,970 --> 01:26:51,710
Thank you, thank you.

1664
01:26:51,770 --> 01:26:53,510
Not all triangles are dangerous!

1665
01:27:06,550 --> 01:27:07,390
Richard sent me.

1666
01:27:07,450 --> 01:27:09,070
I used a little bit of the medkits, though.

1667
01:27:12,410 --> 01:27:13,230
Sure, I do.

1668
01:27:13,970 --> 01:27:15,730
He came here with Squint, our leader.

1669
01:27:16,250 --> 01:27:19,410
He used to be a guide, so he knows the area.

1670
01:27:20,090 --> 01:27:23,610
And like any guide, he's got your back on the road, but...

1671
01:27:23,610 --> 01:27:26,270
Don't count on him jumping into a firefight with you.

1672
01:27:26,890 --> 01:27:29,710
Best you can hope for is he sends some help your way.

1673
01:27:30,290 --> 01:27:33,110
I might be pushing my luck here, but...

1674
01:27:33,110 --> 01:27:35,170
Could you lend me a hand with something else?

1675
01:27:35,810 --> 01:27:36,390
Wait, what?

1676
01:27:36,870 --> 01:27:37,570
Oh, a mission!

1677
01:27:38,790 --> 01:27:39,570
What are you doing here anyway?

1678
01:27:39,570 --> 01:27:40,570
Yeah, what are you doing here anyway?

1679
01:27:40,630 --> 01:27:41,550
Yeah, why are you here?

1680
01:27:41,550 --> 01:27:44,470
I could ask you the same thing, but I won't.

1681
01:27:44,730 --> 01:27:47,050
The less we know about each other, the better.

1682
01:27:47,750 --> 01:27:49,510
Lose lips and all that, you know?

1683
01:27:50,070 --> 01:27:51,510
Wait, but you want me to help you.

1684
01:27:51,930 --> 01:27:53,350
Alright, let's hear it.

1685
01:27:54,230 --> 01:27:57,030
There's four of us at the boiler house, not far from here.

1686
01:27:57,230 --> 01:27:58,550
I like how, like...

1687
01:27:59,130 --> 01:28:01,910
Because we're playing this in English...

1688
01:28:01,910 --> 01:28:05,870
Instead of them having, like, Ukrainian accents...

1689
01:28:05,870 --> 01:28:09,290
They have, like, Scottish-slash-English accents!

1690
01:28:13,590 --> 01:28:14,350
What is this?

1691
01:28:14,350 --> 01:28:17,430
Like, are we in, like, fucking the UK now?

1692
01:28:19,150 --> 01:28:21,870
Are we, like, in the United Kingdom?

1693
01:28:35,430 --> 01:28:37,070
Alright, fine.

1694
01:28:37,070 --> 01:28:38,770
Wait, how many are there, though?

1695
01:28:43,090 --> 01:28:46,050
The zone expanded to all of Europe!

1696
01:28:46,450 --> 01:28:48,770
The UK is an anomaly!

1697
01:28:57,050 --> 01:28:58,090
Alright, I'll do it.

1698
01:28:58,330 --> 01:28:59,670
I mean, it doesn't mean I have to.

1699
01:28:59,810 --> 01:29:00,690
It just shows up.

1700
01:29:02,570 --> 01:29:04,670
I'll say yes just to make him feel better.

1701
01:29:04,870 --> 01:29:06,730
And then, like, his friends will be like...

1702
01:29:07,510 --> 01:29:10,090
His friends will be like, hey, so that guy you sent...

1703
01:29:10,090 --> 01:29:11,130
Like, is he coming?

1704
01:29:13,290 --> 01:29:14,670
Yeah, and then he'll be like, yeah!

1705
01:29:14,830 --> 01:29:17,150
Like, I sent him, like, three weeks ago.

1706
01:29:21,610 --> 01:29:22,330
Alright, nice.

1707
01:29:23,210 --> 01:29:24,590
I don't have to do this mission.

1708
01:29:28,010 --> 01:29:29,750
Okay, maybe I should drink some vodka.

1709
01:29:29,750 --> 01:29:33,490
I don't like... I don't like just seeing this.

1710
01:29:34,410 --> 01:29:35,070
Alright, there we go.

1711
01:29:35,210 --> 01:29:36,090
Wait, is that not vodka?

1712
01:29:36,410 --> 01:29:37,710
No, it's water!

1713
01:29:39,610 --> 01:29:40,830
Okay, maybe beer?

1714
01:29:41,410 --> 01:29:42,550
Does beer help it?

1715
01:29:43,450 --> 01:29:44,670
Okay, alcohol.

1716
01:29:46,070 --> 01:29:47,310
Okay, it's always alcohol.

1717
01:29:49,910 --> 01:29:51,550
Alright, let's loot this area.

1718
01:29:51,910 --> 01:29:52,970
There might be some loot here.

1719
01:29:55,510 --> 01:29:56,670
Is there loot anywhere?

1720
01:29:56,670 --> 01:29:56,910
Anywhere?

1721
01:29:58,870 --> 01:29:59,470
No!

1722
01:30:00,450 --> 01:30:01,050
Water!

1723
01:30:01,550 --> 01:30:02,570
Not water!

1724
01:30:02,690 --> 01:30:04,150
Anything but water.

1725
01:30:05,090 --> 01:30:06,530
They might give you free loot.

1726
01:30:06,630 --> 01:30:10,410
Yeah, but then I'm gonna... I might have to lose some of my loot to save them.

1727
01:30:14,060 --> 01:30:14,980
Is there a door?

1728
01:30:15,720 --> 01:30:16,580
Beer o'clock!

1729
01:30:17,660 --> 01:30:19,240
The fuck is the door?

1730
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:20,980
Oh, it's over here.

1731
01:30:21,180 --> 01:30:21,480
Okay.

1732
01:30:22,520 --> 01:30:23,040
Hello?

1733
01:30:25,280 --> 01:30:26,300
Is there anything?

1734
01:30:26,300 --> 01:30:26,460
Anything?

1735
01:30:27,260 --> 01:30:28,400
Any free stuff?

1736
01:30:30,560 --> 01:30:31,140
Oh, nice.

1737
01:30:32,100 --> 01:30:32,520
Oh, R.

1738
01:30:33,340 --> 01:30:33,940
I learned.

1739
01:30:39,060 --> 01:30:39,720
It's R.

1740
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:42,380
Beer carries everything.

1741
01:30:43,280 --> 01:30:44,860
Oh, I mean, it's like a hundred...

1742
01:30:44,860 --> 01:30:46,220
Okay, so it's next door.

1743
01:30:46,300 --> 01:30:47,540
It's not that bad, actually.

1744
01:30:48,460 --> 01:30:49,500
It is next door.

1745
01:30:50,240 --> 01:30:51,300
It's not that bad.

1746
01:30:51,360 --> 01:30:52,480
Guys, but it has triangle.

1747
01:30:52,760 --> 01:30:54,340
You guys said triangle is dangerous.

1748
01:30:56,400 --> 01:30:57,200
Hello?

1749
01:30:58,760 --> 01:30:59,820
I'm here.

1750
01:31:05,060 --> 01:31:06,580
What's that sound?

1751
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:08,820
Are you an anomaly?

1752
01:31:10,220 --> 01:31:10,580
Ah!

1753
01:31:42,100 --> 01:31:42,900
Okay.

1754
01:31:47,660 --> 01:31:48,880
I see him.

1755
01:31:49,520 --> 01:31:50,260
He has to peek.

1756
01:31:52,480 --> 01:31:53,460
No, you're here.

1757
01:31:55,380 --> 01:31:55,640
Oh!

1758
01:32:03,200 --> 01:32:04,780
This is not fair!

1759
01:32:04,780 --> 01:32:06,200
I have a pistol!

1760
01:32:10,360 --> 01:32:11,280
Oh my God!

1761
01:32:12,260 --> 01:32:14,880
Get out!

1762
01:32:15,240 --> 01:32:15,700
Get out!

1763
01:32:17,020 --> 01:32:20,040
They can do that?!

1764
01:32:20,040 --> 01:32:20,840
He just...

1765
01:32:20,840 --> 01:32:22,360
He just walked out!

1766
01:32:24,080 --> 01:32:25,700
That's illegal!

1767
01:32:27,280 --> 01:32:29,320
That's actually illegal!

1768
01:32:30,140 --> 01:32:31,600
Holy fuck!

1769
01:32:32,340 --> 01:32:33,480
That's illegal!

1770
01:32:33,480 --> 01:32:33,980
Oh!

1771
01:32:36,540 --> 01:32:38,000
I'm gonna run up.

1772
01:32:39,280 --> 01:32:40,140
Where is he?

1773
01:32:43,360 --> 01:32:44,560
What the fuck?

1774
01:32:44,600 --> 01:32:47,500
He ran over here now?!

1775
01:32:47,500 --> 01:32:48,760
Where is he?

1776
01:32:51,280 --> 01:32:52,740
That was literally...

1777
01:32:52,740 --> 01:32:55,040
I don't have ammo for this anymore!

1778
01:32:57,740 --> 01:32:58,940
I need to reload.

1779
01:32:59,960 --> 01:33:00,600
Reload!

1780
01:33:05,670 --> 01:33:06,610
There we go.

1781
01:33:07,590 --> 01:33:08,630
Jesus Christ!

1782
01:33:10,330 --> 01:33:11,210
Oh, powerful!

1783
01:33:11,410 --> 01:33:12,270
Thank you for the super chat!

1784
01:33:12,350 --> 01:33:13,290
Thank you!

1785
01:33:15,490 --> 01:33:16,630
Where's the last guy?

1786
01:33:18,470 --> 01:33:20,130
I can't believe it!

1787
01:33:20,750 --> 01:33:21,790
He just...

1788
01:33:22,310 --> 01:33:23,310
Oh, you think...

1789
01:33:23,310 --> 01:33:25,470
Oh, you think that's gonna save you?

1790
01:33:25,690 --> 01:33:26,510
Oh wait, it is.

1791
01:33:26,670 --> 01:33:27,190
I don't know where...

1792
01:33:27,190 --> 01:33:27,590
Whoa!

1793
01:33:30,150 --> 01:33:30,710
Whoa!

1794
01:33:30,950 --> 01:33:30,990
Whoa!

1795
01:33:30,990 --> 01:33:31,350
Give me a sec.

1796
01:33:31,430 --> 01:33:31,890
Reloading.

1797
01:33:32,890 --> 01:33:33,670
That's fucking right.

1798
01:33:34,490 --> 01:33:35,850
That's fucking right.

1799
01:33:38,350 --> 01:33:39,150
There we go.

1800
01:33:39,250 --> 01:33:40,370
Everything is fine now.

1801
01:33:40,630 --> 01:33:41,190
That...

1802
01:33:42,050 --> 01:33:43,830
That took way too long.

1803
01:33:44,890 --> 01:33:46,670
It took...

1804
01:33:49,170 --> 01:33:51,210
Oh no, I gotta use a bandage.

1805
01:33:52,130 --> 01:33:53,990
Wait, there's more?!

1806
01:33:57,590 --> 01:33:58,510
More left?

1807
01:33:58,690 --> 01:34:00,190
No, it's night time!

1808
01:34:03,470 --> 01:34:04,270
Please!

1809
01:34:07,710 --> 01:34:09,910
Where are you?

1810
01:34:13,450 --> 01:34:15,130
Where did he come from?

1811
01:34:15,130 --> 01:34:16,410
Oh, I'm fucking turning on the lights.

1812
01:34:20,500 --> 01:34:21,300
Okay.

1813
01:34:22,800 --> 01:34:24,300
At least I have two bullets.

1814
01:34:29,200 --> 01:34:30,120
Where is he?

1815
01:34:31,320 --> 01:34:32,380
Oh shit!

1816
01:34:34,320 --> 01:34:35,320
What?!

1817
01:34:35,320 --> 01:34:36,080
Oh fuck!

1818
01:34:36,460 --> 01:34:37,100
AD!

1819
01:34:38,900 --> 01:34:41,320
There we go!

1820
01:34:41,700 --> 01:34:42,540
I knew it!

1821
01:34:43,540 --> 01:34:44,760
The cat AD!

1822
01:34:45,020 --> 01:34:45,780
My AD!

1823
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:48,500
Alright.

1824
01:34:49,120 --> 01:34:50,480
Nice, we did it.

1825
01:34:50,560 --> 01:34:51,540
Movement!

1826
01:34:54,020 --> 01:34:55,420
I fucking movement!

1827
01:34:55,420 --> 01:34:55,720
Movement!

1828
01:34:57,860 --> 01:34:58,820
Alright, nice.

1829
01:34:59,660 --> 01:35:01,420
Wait, oh wait, he's...

1830
01:35:02,120 --> 01:35:02,460
There.

1831
01:35:11,600 --> 01:35:12,740
Oh wait, I'm bleeding.

1832
01:35:13,680 --> 01:35:15,100
Sir, I'm bleeding.

1833
01:35:18,160 --> 01:35:19,880
Sir, I'm bleeding, please.

1834
01:35:20,420 --> 01:35:22,160
Sir, can you talk a little faster?

1835
01:35:42,220 --> 01:35:42,900
Yeah.

1836
01:35:44,220 --> 01:35:44,620
Yeah?

1837
01:35:44,620 --> 01:35:45,600
Sir, I'm bleeding, please.

1838
01:35:45,980 --> 01:35:47,440
I'm not okay.

1839
01:36:01,980 --> 01:36:02,620
I'm bleeding.

1840
01:36:02,620 --> 01:36:03,640
That detector will do?

1841
01:36:04,640 --> 01:36:06,740
We got time to bleed.

1842
01:36:07,100 --> 01:36:08,700
Here you go, thank you for the super chat.

1843
01:36:08,800 --> 01:36:09,900
Thank you, thank you.

1844
01:36:17,280 --> 01:36:17,920
Welcome.

1845
01:36:22,320 --> 01:36:23,600
I mean...

1846
01:36:23,600 --> 01:36:24,400
Okay.

1847
01:36:24,400 --> 01:36:24,800
Okay.

1848
01:36:27,040 --> 01:36:28,000
You know...

1849
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:28,420
What?

1850
01:36:32,120 --> 01:36:34,520
I thought he was talking about me.

1851
01:36:50,740 --> 01:36:52,300
Okay, I have attachments?

1852
01:36:52,660 --> 01:36:53,760
I don't have attachments.

1853
01:37:01,320 --> 01:37:03,180
Wait, so what were you doing here, Gloomy?

1854
01:37:12,900 --> 01:37:14,400
Yeah, you allowed him in there.

1855
01:37:14,600 --> 01:37:16,700
So what's the point of living in the zone?

1856
01:37:21,140 --> 01:37:22,200
Oh, thanks for asking.

1857
01:37:22,600 --> 01:37:24,340
Oh, Gloomy's watching my stream.

1858
01:37:29,540 --> 01:37:30,280
Thanks, Gloomy.

1859
01:37:30,400 --> 01:37:31,960
I didn't realize you were watching the stream.

1860
01:37:37,600 --> 01:37:38,440
Alright, so...

1861
01:37:38,440 --> 01:37:39,520
Okay, I should reload this.

1862
01:37:42,340 --> 01:37:42,780
Alright.

1863
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:44,660
So apparently it's better than living in the mainland.

1864
01:37:44,900 --> 01:37:47,720
Wait, if I change it to, like, Ukrainian...

1865
01:37:48,280 --> 01:37:50,360
Do they speak English Ukrainian?

1866
01:37:50,640 --> 01:37:52,460
Like, English in a Ukrainian accent?

1867
01:37:53,100 --> 01:37:54,540
Or, like, Ukrainian?

1868
01:37:55,960 --> 01:37:57,980
And it's like, put it in Ukrainian.

1869
01:37:58,200 --> 01:37:59,400
But I'm like, no, guys.

1870
01:37:59,460 --> 01:38:03,660
There's a reason why I didn't put it in...

1871
01:38:03,660 --> 01:38:04,380
Okay, no.

1872
01:38:04,480 --> 01:38:05,960
I think it's, like, full Ukrainian.

1873
01:38:10,080 --> 01:38:11,560
Guys, okay.

1874
01:38:11,660 --> 01:38:14,860
I don't think...

1875
01:38:15,680 --> 01:38:16,420
Guys,

1876
01:38:21,580 --> 01:38:23,600
I don't think I can understand what he's saying.

1877
01:38:24,740 --> 01:38:25,960
You can read.

1878
01:38:26,340 --> 01:38:28,000
It'll be fine.

1879
01:38:28,400 --> 01:38:31,520
Guys, I rather think that UK means the United Kingdom.

1880
01:38:38,080 --> 01:38:43,480
When they say UK, they mean the United Kingdom.

1881
01:38:47,180 --> 01:38:48,340
Did I get everything?

1882
01:38:49,740 --> 01:38:50,800
Oh, no, I didn't.

1883
01:38:51,400 --> 01:38:54,800
I feel like I have, like, so much, like, random junk.

1884
01:39:01,090 --> 01:39:01,490
Okay.

1885
01:39:02,250 --> 01:39:02,950
We did it.

1886
01:39:02,990 --> 01:39:03,390
We finished.

1887
01:39:03,550 --> 01:39:06,870
Okay, and then I guess, like, we can go to the actual...

1888
01:39:06,870 --> 01:39:08,530
Do we need to go back to the other guy?

1889
01:39:10,010 --> 01:39:11,930
If only Doki could read.

1890
01:39:12,610 --> 01:39:14,730
The UK Brexit, they did it so hard.

1891
01:39:14,850 --> 01:39:16,050
They went to Chernobyl.

1892
01:39:16,730 --> 01:39:24,950
I just find it fucking hilarious that, like, you would think they would have Ukrainian accents, you know?

1893
01:39:27,370 --> 01:39:33,110
But then, like, but instead, it's, like, they give them British accents.

1894
01:39:33,410 --> 01:39:35,850
So, it's, like, it's so weird.

1895
01:39:40,890 --> 01:39:42,310
Bonsai, thank you for the superchat.

1896
01:39:42,370 --> 01:39:43,070
Thank you, thank you.

1897
01:39:43,090 --> 01:39:43,930
It was your birthday?

1898
01:39:44,650 --> 01:39:46,210
Happy birthday to you.

1899
01:39:46,330 --> 01:39:48,070
Happy birthday to you.

1900
01:39:48,290 --> 01:39:50,190
Happy birthday, dear Bonsai.

1901
01:39:50,390 --> 01:39:51,850
Happy birthday to you.

1902
01:39:52,210 --> 01:39:53,290
United Chernobyl.

1903
01:39:54,430 --> 01:39:55,350
Oh, wait.

1904
01:39:59,790 --> 01:40:00,390
Okay.

1905
01:40:03,210 --> 01:40:04,510
Then we go this way.

1906
01:40:04,510 --> 01:40:05,450
See, guys?

1907
01:40:05,530 --> 01:40:06,170
I'm learning.

1908
01:40:06,710 --> 01:40:07,990
Who said I can't learn?

1909
01:40:10,930 --> 01:40:13,170
Can I, like, go from here?

1910
01:40:16,710 --> 01:40:17,590
Oh, no.

1911
01:40:17,670 --> 01:40:19,150
I don't think I was supposed to go here.

1912
01:40:22,860 --> 01:40:23,640
Wait a minute.

1913
01:40:23,760 --> 01:40:24,020
Wait.

1914
01:40:24,280 --> 01:40:25,340
This doesn't make sense.

1915
01:40:26,280 --> 01:40:27,420
How do I cross it?

1916
01:40:31,740 --> 01:40:33,600
I don't think I was supposed to go there.

1917
01:40:35,500 --> 01:40:36,620
Like here, maybe?

1918
01:40:37,420 --> 01:40:38,900
Oh, I'm sorry!

1919
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:42,940
Okay, it wasn't there.

1920
01:40:44,840 --> 01:40:46,200
Wait, I fucked it up.

1921
01:40:46,440 --> 01:40:47,960
Wait, now I'm stuck here.

1922
01:40:49,420 --> 01:40:50,580
Okay, there we go.

1923
01:40:53,260 --> 01:40:54,420
The fuck?

1924
01:40:59,680 --> 01:41:00,260
Okay.

1925
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:02,880
Oh, I have to go here.

1926
01:41:03,540 --> 01:41:03,960
Okay.

1927
01:41:04,240 --> 01:41:05,260
I have to.

1928
01:41:05,900 --> 01:41:06,900
I hate this.

1929
01:41:06,940 --> 01:41:07,960
I hate this map system.

1930
01:41:07,960 --> 01:41:12,460
I'm trying to figure out how to fucking traverse here.

1931
01:41:18,380 --> 01:41:19,620
Get me out of here.

1932
01:41:19,720 --> 01:41:21,920
Get me out of here.

1933
01:41:29,920 --> 01:41:30,940
Maybe here?

1934
01:41:35,120 --> 01:41:35,860
What's that?

1935
01:41:37,280 --> 01:41:38,620
What's that over here?

1936
01:41:38,740 --> 01:41:39,280
Oh, nice.

1937
01:41:39,660 --> 01:41:44,520
Is there any options to have Ukrainian voice actors and English subs?

1938
01:41:44,520 --> 01:41:45,980
Excuse me, this is so funny.

1939
01:41:46,120 --> 01:41:48,400
Either way, Jesus Christ.

1940
01:41:48,500 --> 01:41:49,780
Thank you for the super chat.

1941
01:41:49,940 --> 01:41:50,860
Thank you.

1942
01:41:51,060 --> 01:41:53,640
The only issue is like I gotta read.

1943
01:41:55,020 --> 01:41:58,440
Oh, strangers with guns aren't welcome to hide your weapon.

1944
01:41:58,640 --> 01:41:59,300
Use H.

1945
01:41:59,940 --> 01:42:02,220
Oh, I'm friendly!

1946
01:42:07,940 --> 01:42:09,620
Where's the strangers with guns?

1947
01:42:16,440 --> 01:42:17,420
I'm friendly.

1948
01:42:17,680 --> 01:42:18,860
I don't have guns.

1949
01:42:26,160 --> 01:42:27,780
I don't have a gun in my hand.

1950
01:42:27,880 --> 01:42:28,500
I'm friendly.

1951
01:42:31,420 --> 01:42:31,940
Hello!

1952
01:42:35,580 --> 01:42:36,100
Hey!

1953
01:42:44,680 --> 01:42:46,440
Yo, it's you around the zone.

1954
01:42:51,660 --> 01:42:52,180
Alright.

1955
01:42:52,960 --> 01:42:54,400
Thanks, NPC.

1956
01:42:55,280 --> 01:42:56,960
Mr. Kyle number 4.

1957
01:42:58,820 --> 01:43:02,180
So, what happens if I...

1958
01:43:03,060 --> 01:43:05,980
What happens if I...

1959
01:43:05,980 --> 01:43:06,840
Wait, he's friendly.

1960
01:43:09,940 --> 01:43:10,400
Yeah.

1961
01:43:11,280 --> 01:43:12,500
He doesn't care if I have a gun.

1962
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:15,960
The fuck did I hide my gun?

1963
01:43:25,920 --> 01:43:26,700
Okay.

1964
01:43:26,720 --> 01:43:27,920
Hey, so why are you in the zone?

1965
01:43:29,280 --> 01:43:29,740
Bye!

1966
01:43:35,080 --> 01:43:36,180
Yeah, how do you?

1967
01:43:37,640 --> 01:43:38,420
Okay.

1968
01:43:46,040 --> 01:43:48,780
A good soldier follows orders.

1969
01:43:50,720 --> 01:43:51,720
Oh, shit.

1970
01:43:52,260 --> 01:43:54,000
There are dogs in the military.

1971
01:43:55,800 --> 01:43:57,740
See, there's nothing to worry about.

1972
01:43:57,840 --> 01:43:58,380
They're friendly.

1973
01:44:02,080 --> 01:44:04,820
Okay, we gotta meet the Zen... Zendaya.

1974
01:44:07,520 --> 01:44:08,680
I don't remember her name.

1975
01:44:08,760 --> 01:44:09,700
I assume it's Zendaya.

1976
01:44:10,600 --> 01:44:11,620
It's like over here.

1977
01:44:15,710 --> 01:44:17,170
Are you guys having a good time?

1978
01:44:23,200 --> 01:44:23,840
Eh.

1979
01:44:25,820 --> 01:44:27,520
Join stalkers for some gossip.

1980
01:44:34,320 --> 01:44:35,440
The fuck?

1981
01:44:36,160 --> 01:44:37,280
There you go.

1982
01:44:37,860 --> 01:44:40,500
I'm gonna get copyright strike for all around the world.

1983
01:44:40,620 --> 01:44:41,700
Miss Worldwide.

1984
01:44:46,800 --> 01:44:47,640
I'm gonna be like, whoa.

1985
01:44:52,550 --> 01:44:53,770
Zendaya, is that you?

1986
01:44:54,410 --> 01:44:55,050
Oh, soldier?

1987
01:45:01,480 --> 01:45:02,320
It's alright.

1988
01:45:02,320 --> 01:45:03,900
We're gonna risk it.

1989
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:09,860
We don't need ad revenue for the 70th time.

1990
01:45:11,660 --> 01:45:14,520
I think like 20% of my channel is like demonetized.

1991
01:45:16,720 --> 01:45:18,800
That's like, fuck streamer mode!

1992
01:45:33,080 --> 01:45:37,040
Three dead wardens up the zone's ass.

1993
01:45:38,300 --> 01:45:39,640
A good start.

1994
01:45:40,560 --> 01:45:41,060
Oh!

1995
01:45:41,820 --> 01:45:42,520
Oh!

1996
01:45:43,660 --> 01:45:44,420
For me?

1997
01:45:45,640 --> 01:45:48,860
A trader who goes by Hamster is peddling this service weapon.

1998
01:45:49,420 --> 01:45:50,620
Belonged to one of those wardens.

1999
01:45:52,200 --> 01:45:53,740
He got it from Squint.

2000
01:45:54,740 --> 01:45:55,860
Apologies, Captain.

2001
01:45:56,560 --> 01:45:58,680
But Zalesia is a free trade zone.

2002
01:45:59,100 --> 01:46:00,900
We have an agreement with Caution.

2003
01:46:02,340 --> 01:46:03,500
Where is Squint?

2004
01:46:04,500 --> 01:46:06,380
The zone has its share of secrets.

2005
01:46:06,720 --> 01:46:08,700
Who are we to meddle in its designs?

2006
01:46:09,640 --> 01:46:12,080
Playing a wise and stalker sage, are you?

2007
01:46:13,080 --> 01:46:13,640
Fine.

2008
01:46:14,600 --> 01:46:18,640
Guys, so you know how this is like my first stalker game?

2009
01:46:19,200 --> 01:46:21,260
What the fuck is a stalker game?

2010
01:46:26,780 --> 01:46:29,600
Because I feel like I should ask that now.

2011
01:46:30,800 --> 01:46:33,720
They never explained it!

2012
01:46:34,360 --> 01:46:39,100
They never explained what a stalker is!

2013
01:46:42,820 --> 01:46:44,660
Oh shit!

2014
01:46:44,800 --> 01:46:45,740
No, I'm stalking the J!

2015
01:46:47,480 --> 01:46:48,300
No!

2016
01:46:49,540 --> 01:46:50,240
I...

2017
01:46:50,240 --> 01:46:51,600
I... No!

2018
01:47:01,080 --> 01:47:01,580
Oh, okay.

2019
01:47:01,620 --> 01:47:02,300
Oh, thank god.

2020
01:47:02,380 --> 01:47:04,320
Okay, I was like, what did I say?

2021
01:47:04,800 --> 01:47:06,440
What did I say?

2022
01:47:09,320 --> 01:47:11,620
Oh, so I break in the fine artifacts.

2023
01:47:11,920 --> 01:47:12,280
Okay.

2024
01:47:14,400 --> 01:47:15,360
So I'm illegal.

2025
01:47:20,600 --> 01:47:21,560
What the fuck is this?

2026
01:47:21,740 --> 01:47:23,160
I thought he would wait for me.

2027
01:47:23,980 --> 01:47:24,700
That's me.

2028
01:47:25,620 --> 01:47:27,120
Now I know what it means.

2029
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:29,300
Oh, illegal treasure hunter.

2030
01:47:29,580 --> 01:47:31,200
Oh my god, it is the UK!

2031
01:47:32,060 --> 01:47:36,840
I thought it would be for Ukraine, but it's actually for the United Kingdom!

2032
01:47:42,020 --> 01:47:44,060
I'm basically Indiana Jones!

2033
01:47:59,920 --> 01:48:03,620
The zone belongs in a museum!

2034
01:48:06,980 --> 01:48:09,300
Who should I ask about the solder yet?

2035
01:48:17,820 --> 01:48:20,960
I'm gonna move the entire zone to the UK!

2036
01:48:25,800 --> 01:48:29,020
I didn't know Chernobyl was located in London, guys.

2037
01:48:31,720 --> 01:48:36,860
I gotta find a solder and beat the shit out of him for selling us out.

2038
01:48:38,160 --> 01:48:38,680
Okay.

2039
01:48:39,060 --> 01:48:40,840
So you have any jobs for me?

2040
01:48:50,080 --> 01:48:52,520
It's actually in Birmingham, Tokyo!

2041
01:48:56,860 --> 01:48:58,860
I need my money back.

2042
01:49:01,300 --> 01:49:02,980
Who's Valek Lomax?

2043
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:04,840
The man is this Valek Lomax guy.

2044
01:49:06,100 --> 01:49:09,220
He's new to the zone, but he already made a name for himself.

2045
01:49:09,740 --> 01:49:11,180
This one sharp asshole.

2046
01:49:11,580 --> 01:49:12,620
Not afraid of risks.

2047
01:49:13,100 --> 01:49:14,760
Always full of white plants.

2048
01:49:15,960 --> 01:49:17,020
Kinda liked the guy.

2049
01:49:17,500 --> 01:49:18,480
Thought he would go far.

2050
01:49:19,220 --> 01:49:20,700
He went too far.

2051
01:49:21,160 --> 01:49:22,440
Got himself a new gun.

2052
01:49:22,840 --> 01:49:25,200
I'm still mopping about how to set him straight.

2053
01:49:26,860 --> 01:49:27,200
Okay.

2054
01:49:27,360 --> 01:49:27,900
Yeah, sure.

2055
01:49:29,940 --> 01:49:30,940
I can do it.

2056
01:49:42,380 --> 01:49:43,580
My money.

2057
01:49:43,900 --> 01:49:44,200
Alright.

2058
01:49:44,500 --> 01:49:45,780
No problem, warlock.

2059
01:49:45,860 --> 01:49:46,600
I got you.

2060
01:49:47,400 --> 01:49:48,580
I'm good at beating muscle.

2061
01:49:49,080 --> 01:49:50,760
Doesn't require a brain for that.

2062
01:49:52,860 --> 01:49:54,460
I'm gonna steal some vodka.

2063
01:49:54,460 --> 01:49:54,560
Vodka.

2064
01:49:55,140 --> 01:49:56,660
Real quick.

2065
01:49:58,220 --> 01:49:58,640
Hello.

2066
01:50:00,220 --> 01:50:02,580
You seem like...

2067
01:50:02,580 --> 01:50:02,840
Oh.

2068
01:50:03,660 --> 01:50:05,020
Okay, nevermind.

2069
01:50:06,140 --> 01:50:06,540
Hi!

2070
01:50:17,280 --> 01:50:17,800
Oh,

2071
01:50:22,400 --> 01:50:22,540
cool.

2072
01:50:22,760 --> 01:50:25,300
Oh, so it's like...

2073
01:50:25,300 --> 01:50:27,240
Oh, wait.

2074
01:50:27,320 --> 01:50:27,960
No free stuff.

2075
01:50:28,360 --> 01:50:28,820
Oh, beer.

2076
01:50:29,620 --> 01:50:31,680
Beer is so expensive these days.

2077
01:50:32,600 --> 01:50:34,640
So it's like you gotta fight yourself.

2078
01:50:34,640 --> 01:50:36,420
Oh, personal note.

2079
01:50:38,140 --> 01:50:38,460
iPad.

2080
01:50:39,640 --> 01:50:41,480
I've chosen not to speak openly about his.

2081
01:50:41,600 --> 01:50:42,200
But hear me out.

2082
01:50:42,340 --> 01:50:43,020
I've had enough.

2083
01:50:44,080 --> 01:50:44,620
Okay.

2084
01:50:47,940 --> 01:50:48,380
Oh, wait.

2085
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:52,040
Why can't all messages be like this?

2086
01:50:56,630 --> 01:50:58,090
Oh, this is what happened.

2087
01:51:00,350 --> 01:51:00,630
Okay.

2088
01:51:00,910 --> 01:51:01,650
Let's see.

2089
01:51:01,870 --> 01:51:03,390
I have to ask warlock.

2090
01:51:03,390 --> 01:51:03,930
Okay.

2091
01:51:04,370 --> 01:51:05,470
And ask gafter.

2092
01:51:05,850 --> 01:51:06,790
Ask captain.

2093
01:51:07,170 --> 01:51:10,870
Okay, so I need to find everything I need to find out about soldier.

2094
01:51:12,150 --> 01:51:12,610
Alright.

2095
01:51:14,270 --> 01:51:14,630
Open.

2096
01:51:18,550 --> 01:51:19,270
Which one?

2097
01:51:19,350 --> 01:51:19,590
Me?

2098
01:51:20,990 --> 01:51:21,710
Not me?

2099
01:51:22,950 --> 01:51:25,150
Okay, we gotta go this way.

2100
01:51:28,540 --> 01:51:30,340
Okay, where is...

2101
01:51:30,340 --> 01:51:30,900
Is it here?

2102
01:51:33,060 --> 01:51:33,460
Hello.

2103
01:51:34,500 --> 01:51:35,800
The game is based on a movie.

2104
01:51:35,920 --> 01:51:37,340
Which that movie is based on a book.

2105
01:51:37,500 --> 01:51:38,360
Called Roadside Picnic.

2106
01:51:38,720 --> 01:51:41,080
Where in the book, aliens arrived on earth to have a picnic.

2107
01:51:41,320 --> 01:51:42,260
And leaving the trash.

2108
01:51:42,580 --> 01:51:45,400
And aliens trashed another person's treasure.

2109
01:51:45,740 --> 01:51:46,960
Thank you for the super chat, Giga.

2110
01:51:47,100 --> 01:51:47,940
Thank you, thank you.

2111
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:49,620
That makes a lot more sense now.

2112
01:51:50,600 --> 01:51:52,240
I'm allowed to walk past this?

2113
01:51:57,840 --> 01:52:01,980
How do you know I'm a stalker?

2114
01:52:02,920 --> 01:52:04,700
I'm just wearing regular clothes.

2115
01:52:06,080 --> 01:52:07,000
Okay, what do you need?

2116
01:52:12,100 --> 01:52:14,260
Okay, but everybody is a piece of shit here.

2117
01:52:14,780 --> 01:52:16,300
Isn't that what the zone is?

2118
01:52:17,200 --> 01:52:18,880
You gotta be a piece of shit to be here.

2119
01:52:21,800 --> 01:52:22,220
Okay.

2120
01:52:22,220 --> 01:52:22,820
Screw me.

2121
01:52:35,200 --> 01:52:36,600
Yay,

2122
01:52:40,020 --> 01:52:40,380
murder!

2123
01:52:58,060 --> 01:53:00,360
Who's Uncle Leona?

2124
01:53:03,460 --> 01:53:04,140
Who's Uncle Leona?

2125
01:53:04,140 --> 01:53:04,980
Oh, it's Squint!

2126
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:11,540
Wait, me?

2127
01:53:14,340 --> 01:53:15,620
Yeah!

2128
01:53:17,620 --> 01:53:18,060
Yeah!

2129
01:53:19,520 --> 01:53:21,600
I'm just a guy with five bullets!

2130
01:53:24,180 --> 01:53:25,780
Wait, can you at least give me some bullets?

2131
01:53:30,840 --> 01:53:32,880
Wait, I have five bullets!

2132
01:53:33,660 --> 01:53:35,620
Like, if you want me to do this...

2133
01:53:36,500 --> 01:53:37,700
I have five bullets!

2134
01:53:38,780 --> 01:53:39,520
Please, sir!

2135
01:53:39,980 --> 01:53:42,260
Look at my- oh wait, what the fuck is this?

2136
01:53:43,140 --> 01:53:44,220
Okay, JK.

2137
01:53:44,520 --> 01:53:46,760
JK, I don't just have five bullets.

2138
01:53:46,880 --> 01:53:48,600
JK, but he doesn't know that.

2139
01:53:50,420 --> 01:53:52,360
He doesn't know that, though.

2140
01:53:56,080 --> 01:53:56,660
JK.

2141
01:54:03,680 --> 01:54:05,480
Okay, I'm still looking.

2142
01:54:05,580 --> 01:54:06,260
That's my report.

2143
01:54:10,600 --> 01:54:11,700
That's my report.

2144
01:54:12,780 --> 01:54:13,300
Alright.

2145
01:54:13,960 --> 01:54:15,280
I did my job.

2146
01:54:16,160 --> 01:54:17,100
Can I load anything here?

2147
01:54:18,280 --> 01:54:19,340
Make sure to unload.

2148
01:54:19,480 --> 01:54:21,360
Sometimes, they have bullets in the magazine.

2149
01:54:22,080 --> 01:54:23,600
I can unload a gun?

2150
01:54:24,380 --> 01:54:25,640
I mean, yeah, but like...

2151
01:54:25,640 --> 01:54:26,760
In a video game?

2152
01:54:27,360 --> 01:54:28,940
Do I have, like...

2153
01:54:28,940 --> 01:54:30,080
More bullets for this?

2154
01:54:30,840 --> 01:54:31,540
I do.

2155
01:54:31,540 --> 01:54:31,920
I do.

2156
01:54:35,310 --> 01:54:35,910
Okay.

2157
01:54:41,440 --> 01:54:43,060
Okay, that should be...

2158
01:54:43,060 --> 01:54:43,760
Good, right?

2159
01:54:45,260 --> 01:54:45,860
Okay.

2160
01:54:47,640 --> 01:54:49,260
Oh, G is to unload?

2161
01:54:50,280 --> 01:54:51,100
I need to, like...

2162
01:54:51,100 --> 01:54:52,080
Sell these.

2163
01:54:52,300 --> 01:54:55,060
Maybe if I take this, and then...

2164
01:54:55,760 --> 01:54:57,480
Okay, it's unloaded already.

2165
01:54:58,920 --> 01:54:59,520
So...

2166
01:54:59,520 --> 01:55:01,180
I'm gonna double check...

2167
01:55:01,600 --> 01:55:02,300
My guns.

2168
01:55:03,840 --> 01:55:05,520
Okay, we'll unload this.

2169
01:55:05,520 --> 01:55:06,460
G, right?

2170
01:55:07,060 --> 01:55:08,180
Guys, you lied to me.

2171
01:55:09,320 --> 01:55:10,340
Wait a minute.

2172
01:55:11,280 --> 01:55:12,660
Can't unload a gun?

2173
01:55:15,100 --> 01:55:16,280
Can't unload it?

2174
01:55:16,480 --> 01:55:17,700
I need to sell these, though.

2175
01:55:19,320 --> 01:55:21,100
Sell these, and then...

2176
01:55:21,100 --> 01:55:23,520
This, and...

2177
01:55:24,560 --> 01:55:26,340
You right-click, and it'll unload...

2178
01:55:26,340 --> 01:55:26,680
Oh!

2179
01:55:29,520 --> 01:55:30,840
Wait, why did I unload this?

2180
01:55:30,860 --> 01:55:32,240
This is the best one I have.

2181
01:55:36,480 --> 01:55:36,920
Okay.

2182
01:55:37,420 --> 01:55:38,440
Oh my god.

2183
01:55:38,580 --> 01:55:39,680
Okay, let's see.

2184
01:55:40,520 --> 01:55:41,800
Wait, do I have lots of ammo?

2185
01:55:41,900 --> 01:55:43,420
Oh my god, I have so many ammos!

2186
01:55:45,380 --> 01:55:46,460
Wait, this is...

2187
01:55:46,460 --> 01:55:47,320
Actually pretty neat.

2188
01:55:47,440 --> 01:55:50,640
Okay, we'll take this out, and then...

2189
01:55:50,640 --> 01:55:52,640
Unload these, and...

2190
01:55:53,340 --> 01:55:54,500
Okay, we're keeping that.

2191
01:55:54,920 --> 01:55:56,360
And then we'll sell all the other guns.

2192
01:55:57,520 --> 01:55:58,520
Okay, nice.

2193
01:56:00,760 --> 01:56:02,560
Okay, where is...

2194
01:56:02,560 --> 01:56:03,380
Repeat a map.

2195
01:56:04,960 --> 01:56:05,860
Where am I?

2196
01:56:08,900 --> 01:56:09,320
Warlock...

2197
01:56:09,780 --> 01:56:10,200
Bar...

2198
01:56:10,200 --> 01:56:10,900
Oh, there's Zendaya!

2199
01:56:12,920 --> 01:56:13,340
Um...

2200
01:56:14,740 --> 01:56:16,610
Hamster, trader, private box...

2201
01:56:17,940 --> 01:56:18,360
Guide...

2202
01:56:18,360 --> 01:56:20,640
Okay, we gotta go...

2203
01:56:20,640 --> 01:56:22,600
We gotta go to...

2204
01:56:22,600 --> 01:56:23,700
Oh, there's a side activity.

2205
01:56:24,260 --> 01:56:25,600
We gotta go to a trade...

2206
01:56:25,600 --> 01:56:26,500
Oh, I gotta go to the medic.

2207
01:56:26,960 --> 01:56:28,060
Wait, I need to get healed.

2208
01:56:28,060 --> 01:56:28,320
Is this where the...

2209
01:56:28,320 --> 01:56:30,600
Is this where the medic is?

2210
01:56:33,140 --> 01:56:34,260
The actress?

2211
01:56:40,250 --> 01:56:41,810
Where the fuck is he?

2212
01:56:43,350 --> 01:56:45,110
How do I go to the medbay?

2213
01:56:46,690 --> 01:56:48,030
Are you the healer?

2214
01:56:56,140 --> 01:56:58,260
Who's your boss?

2215
01:56:59,660 --> 01:57:02,160
I don't fucking know who your boss is!

2216
01:57:09,100 --> 01:57:09,840
Hello?

2217
01:57:13,120 --> 01:57:13,840
Are you the boss?

2218
01:57:29,840 --> 01:57:30,960
That's so...

2219
01:57:30,960 --> 01:57:32,260
That's what I'm saying!

2220
01:57:32,260 --> 01:57:32,500
That's what I'm saying!

2221
01:57:34,040 --> 01:57:37,860
If, like, everything's a fucking anomaly...

2222
01:57:37,860 --> 01:57:38,440
Then, like...

2223
01:57:40,540 --> 01:57:41,840
What's real?

2224
01:57:42,320 --> 01:57:44,200
That's what I'm fucking saying!

2225
01:57:47,060 --> 01:57:49,060
Read the five print.

2226
01:57:50,060 --> 01:57:51,380
We're selling this.

2227
01:57:51,580 --> 01:57:52,580
Wait, how do I sell it?

2228
01:57:56,940 --> 01:57:57,620
Um...

2229
01:57:57,620 --> 01:57:58,780
Wait, how do I sell it?

2230
01:58:01,840 --> 01:58:03,320
How do I sell it?

2231
01:58:04,260 --> 01:58:04,880
How do I sell it?

2232
01:58:04,880 --> 01:58:05,320
Take it!

2233
01:58:06,300 --> 01:58:08,240
Fucking take my...

2234
01:58:10,320 --> 01:58:11,840
He won't...

2235
01:58:11,840 --> 01:58:13,580
Oh, you're so fucking...

2236
01:58:14,520 --> 01:58:16,280
Nobody likes you.

2237
01:58:22,660 --> 01:58:24,200
Oh, he's a random?

2238
01:58:24,740 --> 01:58:25,860
He has a name.

2239
01:58:34,640 --> 01:58:35,780
Guys, he has a name.

2240
01:58:35,860 --> 01:58:37,180
He's not just some random NPC.

2241
01:58:37,960 --> 01:58:39,120
Yeah, patch me up, please.

2242
01:58:42,420 --> 01:58:43,640
No, I meant, like, mentally.

2243
01:58:45,580 --> 01:58:47,720
Okay, maybe on the outside.

2244
01:58:48,560 --> 01:58:49,380
You're a doctor.

2245
01:58:49,520 --> 01:58:51,040
You should know I am not okay.

2246
01:58:51,600 --> 01:58:53,000
You should know.

2247
01:58:58,190 --> 01:58:58,590
Okay.

2248
01:58:59,430 --> 01:59:00,430
Okay, Peter Matt.

2249
01:59:01,410 --> 01:59:02,970
Wait, then where is the trader?

2250
01:59:03,270 --> 01:59:03,710
Okay, I guess we have to go this way.

2251
01:59:03,710 --> 01:59:04,610
There's a trader here.

2252
01:59:05,910 --> 01:59:07,450
Alright, we gotta get to the trader.

2253
01:59:10,770 --> 01:59:12,290
Are you a trader?

2254
01:59:13,290 --> 01:59:14,130
What's your name?

2255
01:59:16,210 --> 01:59:17,530
Does he be here?

2256
01:59:19,010 --> 01:59:21,370
Oh my god, this area is so confusing.

2257
01:59:21,630 --> 01:59:21,930
A little.

2258
01:59:22,970 --> 01:59:23,730
Where's the trader?

2259
01:59:27,950 --> 01:59:29,750
Is it Hamster in here?

2260
01:59:30,310 --> 01:59:31,790
Wait, is that that guy?

2261
01:59:31,890 --> 01:59:32,610
The bartender?

2262
01:59:32,610 --> 01:59:34,690
Oh, it's him!

2263
01:59:35,050 --> 01:59:35,690
The warlock.

2264
01:59:35,730 --> 01:59:39,610
Okay, how do I... okay, trade.

2265
01:59:40,750 --> 01:59:41,710
Okay, take my shit.

2266
01:59:43,250 --> 01:59:43,890
Take it!

2267
01:59:46,610 --> 01:59:47,690
What do you mean?

2268
01:59:48,130 --> 01:59:49,190
Oh, okay, he takes that.

2269
01:59:49,370 --> 01:59:52,970
Okay, he doesn't take these.

2270
01:59:53,170 --> 01:59:53,410
Okay.

2271
01:59:58,750 --> 02:00:00,810
Okay, I guess I can sell this then.

2272
02:00:01,990 --> 02:00:03,430
Oh, it can't be sold?

2273
02:00:03,430 --> 02:00:06,390
Okay, at least I get a thousand and five dollars.

2274
02:00:06,930 --> 02:00:09,850
Which is like ten American, I think.

2275
02:00:11,950 --> 02:00:13,990
There's other traders that will pay more?

2276
02:00:14,190 --> 02:00:14,930
That's fine.

2277
02:00:15,150 --> 02:00:16,130
I don't need that.

2278
02:00:19,090 --> 02:00:20,050
Oh, don't?

2279
02:00:20,290 --> 02:00:21,090
Whoop, too late.

2280
02:00:21,450 --> 02:00:22,530
Wait, did I fuck up?

2281
02:00:33,480 --> 02:00:34,820
Hey, can I buy my gun back?

2282
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:43,520
Are you serious?

2283
02:00:59,070 --> 02:01:01,070
Are you...

2284
02:01:02,650 --> 02:01:04,550
How much money do I have?

2285
02:01:05,810 --> 02:01:07,090
I don't...

2286
02:01:08,290 --> 02:01:10,190
But I sold you three guns!

2287
02:01:10,610 --> 02:01:16,970
I sold you three guns!

2288
02:01:17,690 --> 02:01:20,430
Another loss to the zone.

2289
02:01:20,430 --> 02:01:22,330
I got it.

2290
02:01:23,970 --> 02:01:25,710
Also, guys, I can't.

2291
02:01:25,810 --> 02:01:30,630
If I reload a save, I wouldn't have learned anything.

2292
02:01:36,940 --> 02:01:39,080
So that's why everybody was yelling.

2293
02:01:39,300 --> 02:01:40,540
Plenty more guns.

2294
02:01:40,860 --> 02:01:44,280
So that's why everybody was yelling at me.

2295
02:01:45,640 --> 02:01:46,500
Hello, Lance.

2296
02:01:51,560 --> 02:01:53,480
That must have been an anomaly.

2297
02:02:01,960 --> 02:02:02,940
I knew it.

2298
02:02:02,980 --> 02:02:03,740
I fucking knew it.

2299
02:02:03,880 --> 02:02:05,200
He has to be an anomaly.

2300
02:02:08,480 --> 02:02:09,760
Yeah, do you have any work for me?

2301
02:02:14,300 --> 02:02:19,580
A bunch of diggers who used to bring me all sorts of useful stuff have gone off the radar.

2302
02:02:19,860 --> 02:02:22,340
I'm feeling a little uneasy about it.

2303
02:02:23,880 --> 02:02:24,880
Wait, I'll do it.

2304
02:02:25,060 --> 02:02:26,360
Don't have to save money anymore.

2305
02:02:26,460 --> 02:02:27,760
I need $3,000.

2306
02:02:28,640 --> 02:02:30,480
I have the coordinates for their last outing.

2307
02:02:30,900 --> 02:02:33,400
I told them to stay away from that tunnel.

2308
02:02:37,320 --> 02:02:39,220
Back Saturday, Bedlam.

2309
02:02:44,270 --> 02:02:44,830
Alright.

2310
02:02:46,430 --> 02:02:47,390
I'm desperate.

2311
02:02:47,830 --> 02:02:49,810
I'm very desperate right now.

2312
02:02:49,810 --> 02:02:50,570
Oh, wait, upgrade?

2313
02:02:51,650 --> 02:02:52,870
How much is an upgrade?

2314
02:02:55,090 --> 02:02:57,750
Oh, I can upgrade, like, my stuff here.

2315
02:02:58,750 --> 02:02:59,710
I can repair.

2316
02:03:01,590 --> 02:03:02,110
Okay.

2317
02:03:02,450 --> 02:03:03,610
I mean, that's good to know.

2318
02:03:05,990 --> 02:03:08,130
Okay, I need to find...

2319
02:03:08,130 --> 02:03:10,770
I need to find the other guy for this.

2320
02:03:11,410 --> 02:03:12,990
Okay, 221.

2321
02:03:14,910 --> 02:03:16,150
Wait, where am I heading?

2322
02:03:22,620 --> 02:03:23,260
Oh, okay.

2323
02:03:23,700 --> 02:03:24,500
I can meet this guy.

2324
02:03:26,720 --> 02:03:28,240
So he should be here.

2325
02:03:31,340 --> 02:03:33,060
I'm so directionally challenged.

2326
02:03:34,420 --> 02:03:35,740
He's in this house.

2327
02:03:35,800 --> 02:03:36,740
He has to be in this house.

2328
02:03:36,840 --> 02:03:37,660
Oh, he's playing the guitar!

2329
02:03:37,660 --> 02:03:39,040
Guitar!

2330
02:03:54,720 --> 02:03:55,900
Yes!

2331
02:03:59,300 --> 02:04:00,760
Well, not really.

2332
02:04:01,420 --> 02:04:03,440
I'm just getting involved.

2333
02:04:04,380 --> 02:04:05,320
Oh, it's Richie!

2334
02:04:13,340 --> 02:04:14,740
Wait, I wanna ask about Soldier.

2335
02:04:15,880 --> 02:04:16,360
Yeah.

2336
02:04:17,180 --> 02:04:18,540
Sorry for almost getting you killed.

2337
02:04:21,900 --> 02:04:22,380
Where?

2338
02:04:25,560 --> 02:04:27,180
Wait, we are trying to find Squid.

2339
02:04:27,460 --> 02:04:28,420
What has he done?

2340
02:04:46,960 --> 02:04:48,480
Oh yeah, I saw that!

2341
02:04:48,640 --> 02:04:50,060
I was like wondering what it was.

2342
02:04:57,580 --> 02:04:57,980
Okay.

2343
02:04:58,800 --> 02:04:59,000
Sure.

2344
02:05:02,600 --> 02:05:04,020
Oh yeah, I know where he is!

2345
02:05:04,400 --> 02:05:05,620
I know where Squid is!

2346
02:05:07,340 --> 02:05:09,380
Well, like, asking people is not...

2347
02:05:09,380 --> 02:05:10,180
You just gotta ask.

2348
02:05:11,640 --> 02:05:15,740
It's like those people who are like, just ask directions and you're like, NO!

2349
02:05:25,360 --> 02:05:27,880
Wait, is Squid part of his team?

2350
02:05:28,580 --> 02:05:29,920
I thought he was a bad guy.

2351
02:05:30,460 --> 02:05:33,360
Oh my god, is this like Fallout where I have to join factions?

2352
02:05:36,620 --> 02:05:37,020
Wait.

2353
02:05:39,280 --> 02:05:42,700
Do I have to like, decide which faction I wanna be in?

2354
02:05:45,240 --> 02:05:46,620
Oh shit!

2355
02:05:46,820 --> 02:05:47,320
Okay.

2356
02:05:48,560 --> 02:05:53,700
I don't know, I feel like the word people seem to have their shit together.

2357
02:05:55,880 --> 02:06:03,040
Like, you might say they did save me earlier, but like...

2358
02:06:03,040 --> 02:06:04,340
Okay, we gotta go here.

2359
02:06:04,640 --> 02:06:06,900
Explore the warehouse with radiation.

2360
02:06:07,700 --> 02:06:08,860
This is the...

2361
02:06:08,860 --> 02:06:10,280
This has to be the Squid thing.

2362
02:06:12,680 --> 02:06:14,340
Okay, Uncle Leona.

2363
02:06:14,460 --> 02:06:15,540
Maybe he'll guide me there.

2364
02:06:16,160 --> 02:06:18,740
I mean, the word seems to be like...

2365
02:06:18,740 --> 02:06:20,620
They seem to pay a lot more, too.

2366
02:06:24,770 --> 02:06:26,530
They really love the big rock?

2367
02:06:26,670 --> 02:06:28,010
Wait, I love rocks!

2368
02:06:28,510 --> 02:06:30,310
We already have so much in common!

2369
02:06:30,610 --> 02:06:33,190
We are...

2370
02:06:37,710 --> 02:06:39,410
Alright, we go this way.

2371
02:06:39,410 --> 02:06:41,990
Wait, maybe the Leona guy can guide me there.

2372
02:06:47,380 --> 02:06:50,640
Okay, I was gonna say this tiny ass thing, I can't even go through that.

2373
02:06:51,360 --> 02:06:52,220
Wait, where's the guide?

2374
02:06:53,900 --> 02:06:55,160
Where's Uncle Leona?

2375
02:06:56,600 --> 02:06:57,600
Oh, there he is.

2376
02:06:58,940 --> 02:06:59,680
Oh, okay.

2377
02:06:59,820 --> 02:07:01,100
Thanks for all the help, I guess.

2378
02:07:01,780 --> 02:07:02,520
Oh, that's it?

2379
02:07:02,580 --> 02:07:04,060
You're just gonna be like, you got this.

2380
02:07:04,080 --> 02:07:05,160
You're literally a guide!

2381
02:07:05,660 --> 02:07:06,540
Guide people!

2382
02:07:08,040 --> 02:07:08,480
Alright.

2383
02:07:08,920 --> 02:07:10,780
I guess we... Alright, we'll do the...

2384
02:07:10,780 --> 02:07:11,020
Yay!

2385
02:07:12,060 --> 02:07:14,220
Okay, I just need to figure out what to do first.

2386
02:07:14,320 --> 02:07:14,540
Okay.

2387
02:07:16,800 --> 02:07:18,040
We'll do the...

2388
02:07:18,040 --> 02:07:18,640
How am I bleeding?

2389
02:07:18,780 --> 02:07:19,200
What did I do?

2390
02:07:19,280 --> 02:07:19,680
Did I trip?

2391
02:07:20,020 --> 02:07:20,520
Did I...

2392
02:07:22,780 --> 02:07:23,820
What happened?

2393
02:07:24,040 --> 02:07:27,520
Did I fucking, like, stub my toe?

2394
02:07:34,450 --> 02:07:36,750
There was a barbed wire?

2395
02:07:38,630 --> 02:07:40,190
I'm gonna stub my toe.

2396
02:07:40,190 --> 02:07:40,310
There we go.

2397
02:07:43,370 --> 02:07:47,110
Okay, we'll go do the mini mission first, because it's, like, literally right here.

2398
02:07:49,910 --> 02:07:51,350
Okay, I already have my light on.

2399
02:07:51,770 --> 02:07:52,630
I wasn't sure.

2400
02:07:52,770 --> 02:07:54,190
This area is so dark.

2401
02:07:55,030 --> 02:07:55,230
Alright.

2402
02:07:56,650 --> 02:07:58,350
The grass, it was the anomaly.

2403
02:07:58,890 --> 02:08:00,110
Bleeding is an anomaly.

2404
02:08:00,370 --> 02:08:01,130
Thank you for the super chat.

2405
02:08:01,190 --> 02:08:01,970
Thank you, thank you.

2406
02:08:02,430 --> 02:08:04,130
Alright, we'll explore here first.

2407
02:08:04,690 --> 02:08:05,630
Can't be that bad.

2408
02:08:05,630 --> 02:08:05,690
What happened?

2409
02:08:13,960 --> 02:08:15,880
Shoot first, ask questions later.

2410
02:08:19,940 --> 02:08:20,960
Don't worry, movement.

2411
02:08:24,480 --> 02:08:24,860
Alright.

2412
02:08:26,960 --> 02:08:27,820
Oh, shit!

2413
02:08:28,500 --> 02:08:29,480
I saw the present.

2414
02:08:32,220 --> 02:08:33,240
Alright, that should be it.

2415
02:08:36,320 --> 02:08:36,800
See?

2416
02:08:36,960 --> 02:08:37,260
Easy.

2417
02:08:40,560 --> 02:08:41,080
See?

2418
02:08:41,220 --> 02:08:42,260
Look at that, guys!

2419
02:08:42,740 --> 02:08:45,040
I'm figuring out how to aim in this game!

2420
02:08:52,640 --> 02:08:53,940
Oh my god, it's a fucking nerd.

2421
02:08:55,360 --> 02:08:55,660
Okay.

2422
02:08:56,660 --> 02:08:58,420
Yeah, pay him what you owe him!

2423
02:08:58,420 --> 02:09:00,500
Pay up your debt to Warlock first.

2424
02:09:00,680 --> 02:09:02,000
He promised me a cut.

2425
02:09:03,360 --> 02:09:04,400
Ah, well...

2426
02:09:04,400 --> 02:09:06,560
I was going to pay him back, honest.

2427
02:09:07,020 --> 02:09:07,420
Now?

2428
02:09:08,340 --> 02:09:10,200
Fair enough, that's the right thing to do.

2429
02:09:10,740 --> 02:09:11,060
Done.

2430
02:09:11,500 --> 02:09:12,480
I sent the coupons.

2431
02:09:12,840 --> 02:09:14,180
Both yours and Warlock's.

2432
02:09:14,480 --> 02:09:15,000
Coupons?

2433
02:09:15,360 --> 02:09:15,600
What?

2434
02:09:16,380 --> 02:09:17,220
They just got crypto?

2435
02:09:18,320 --> 02:09:19,200
Is that...

2436
02:09:20,760 --> 02:09:22,280
Did I got crypto?

2437
02:09:31,130 --> 02:09:33,050
What the fuck is coupons?

2438
02:09:35,750 --> 02:09:37,370
Did he just send me crypto?

2439
02:09:37,630 --> 02:09:38,570
Like, cryptocurrency?

2440
02:09:40,890 --> 02:09:43,030
I thought I'd get, like, cash.

2441
02:09:45,390 --> 02:09:46,990
Wait, what happens if I kill him?

2442
02:09:50,580 --> 02:09:52,500
Would anything bad happen to me?

2443
02:09:55,380 --> 02:09:56,880
Like, I already got what I needed.

2444
02:09:59,080 --> 02:10:00,040
He died.

2445
02:10:00,040 --> 02:10:00,560
He died.

2446
02:10:03,700 --> 02:10:05,800
I don't know.

2447
02:10:06,340 --> 02:10:07,620
I lose trust.

2448
02:10:07,880 --> 02:10:09,420
Who's gonna see it?

2449
02:10:09,680 --> 02:10:12,840
If I close all the doors, no one will know it was me.

2450
02:10:24,450 --> 02:10:26,150
No one will know.

2451
02:10:32,530 --> 02:10:35,550
He didn't even react.

2452
02:10:38,070 --> 02:10:41,470
Guys, I didn't...

2453
02:10:41,790 --> 02:10:45,110
Guys, he didn't even react.

2454
02:10:46,830 --> 02:10:49,190
I didn't realize I was doing damage.

2455
02:10:49,670 --> 02:10:51,930
I didn't know how he got him.

2456
02:10:56,150 --> 02:10:57,810
I didn't know.

2457
02:10:58,330 --> 02:10:58,930
I thought...

2458
02:10:58,930 --> 02:11:01,870
I thought I did zero damage.

2459
02:11:03,710 --> 02:11:05,470
When I get found...

2460
02:11:05,470 --> 02:11:06,550
When the flashes...

2461
02:11:06,550 --> 02:11:09,110
Each particle continues to...

2462
02:11:09,800 --> 02:11:12,690
He trusted you, Doki.

2463
02:11:14,610 --> 02:11:16,090
He fucking just...

2464
02:11:16,090 --> 02:11:17,910
I don't know.

2465
02:11:18,990 --> 02:11:19,850
He collapsed.

2466
02:11:20,150 --> 02:11:22,030
I was supposed to know it worked.

2467
02:11:23,510 --> 02:11:25,330
You pumped him twice.

2468
02:11:25,390 --> 02:11:26,050
You pumped him twice on his shoulder.

2469
02:11:26,270 --> 02:11:27,530
He fell dead.

2470
02:11:28,510 --> 02:11:29,150
Truly...

2471
02:11:29,150 --> 02:11:31,110
I was a fucking nerd.

2472
02:11:31,230 --> 02:11:33,690
I knew he was a nerd.

2473
02:11:35,570 --> 02:11:36,930
Guys, it wasn't me.

2474
02:11:37,090 --> 02:11:38,630
He got a heart attack, chat.

2475
02:11:39,130 --> 02:11:42,110
He got a heart attack.

2476
02:11:43,950 --> 02:11:45,610
It wasn't me.

2477
02:11:45,610 --> 02:11:45,750
It wasn't me.

2478
02:11:48,030 --> 02:11:51,330
I thought it didn't even do damage.

2479
02:11:51,830 --> 02:11:52,750
I just let it go.

2480
02:11:52,990 --> 02:11:54,250
It doesn't even work.

2481
02:11:54,690 --> 02:11:55,710
You liars.

2482
02:11:55,910 --> 02:11:57,350
You can't even kill him.

2483
02:11:57,730 --> 02:11:59,910
He just fell over.

2484
02:12:03,510 --> 02:12:05,590
He just fell out.

2485
02:12:05,730 --> 02:12:07,610
He just fell out of the window, guys.

2486
02:12:16,940 --> 02:12:17,500
Whoa.

2487
02:12:18,960 --> 02:12:20,500
Guys, the window got him.

2488
02:12:21,440 --> 02:12:22,180
It wasn't me.

2489
02:12:26,930 --> 02:12:28,030
Here we go.

2490
02:12:32,560 --> 02:12:33,860
Oh, it's this way.

2491
02:12:34,680 --> 02:12:35,120
Okay.

2492
02:12:39,750 --> 02:12:40,650
I can't...

2493
02:12:40,650 --> 02:12:42,090
I don't have a detector, though.

2494
02:12:42,110 --> 02:12:42,950
I'm pretty sure.

2495
02:12:49,120 --> 02:12:51,480
I guess there should be an artifact here.

2496
02:12:58,730 --> 02:12:59,970
Did I get a scan?

2497
02:13:00,070 --> 02:13:00,550
Oh, I did.

2498
02:13:00,550 --> 02:13:00,650
I did.

2499
02:13:08,790 --> 02:13:10,210
Yeah, but I don't think I can...

2500
02:13:10,210 --> 02:13:11,370
There's anything in here.

2501
02:13:13,970 --> 02:13:14,730
Okay, yeah.

2502
02:13:14,890 --> 02:13:16,510
That was a mistake.

2503
02:13:16,630 --> 02:13:17,610
Oh, I got bread, though.

2504
02:13:19,050 --> 02:13:19,810
It's okay.

2505
02:13:19,930 --> 02:13:20,770
I got bread.

2506
02:13:22,750 --> 02:13:23,230
Alright.

2507
02:13:24,130 --> 02:13:24,970
Never mind.

2508
02:13:25,030 --> 02:13:25,790
That did nothing.

2509
02:13:28,170 --> 02:13:29,870
The artifact saved me?

2510
02:13:30,170 --> 02:13:31,470
Did I lose my artifact?

2511
02:13:35,500 --> 02:13:36,760
Did I lose it?

2512
02:13:36,760 --> 02:13:38,040
No, I still have it.

2513
02:13:38,100 --> 02:13:38,340
Okay.

2514
02:13:40,380 --> 02:13:41,640
I got the good... See?

2515
02:13:41,860 --> 02:13:43,040
Guys, look at that.

2516
02:13:43,480 --> 02:13:45,780
If I didn't beat up that nerd, I would have died.

2517
02:13:50,780 --> 02:13:51,940
Guys, look at that.

2518
02:13:52,280 --> 02:13:52,620
See?

2519
02:13:54,840 --> 02:13:57,380
I live because I beat up a nerd.

2520
02:13:59,340 --> 02:14:01,000
His life for mine.

2521
02:14:06,260 --> 02:14:06,640
Yeah.

2522
02:14:06,640 --> 02:14:07,120
Okay.

2523
02:14:08,960 --> 02:14:10,420
Okay, Squint is here.

2524
02:14:10,660 --> 02:14:11,280
I hear him.

2525
02:14:12,860 --> 02:14:13,860
He's playing guitar.

2526
02:14:13,980 --> 02:14:15,040
He can't be a bad person.

2527
02:14:26,060 --> 02:14:26,380
Hello?

2528
02:14:30,140 --> 02:14:30,700
Hey.

2529
02:14:34,980 --> 02:14:36,960
I'm looking for a stalker.

2530
02:14:47,400 --> 02:14:49,000
Where did he go?

2531
02:15:00,960 --> 02:15:01,920
Oh,

2532
02:15:07,380 --> 02:15:08,320
this is difficult.

2533
02:15:08,700 --> 02:15:10,500
This is difficult.

2534
02:15:12,140 --> 02:15:12,920
You know what?

2535
02:15:14,380 --> 02:15:14,920
I'm tired.

2536
02:15:19,220 --> 02:15:20,180
That's right!

2537
02:15:20,180 --> 02:15:21,780
What's he gonna do?

2538
02:15:21,920 --> 02:15:22,800
Play the guitar?

2539
02:15:23,160 --> 02:15:24,040
Oh, shit!

2540
02:15:25,780 --> 02:15:26,140
Okay.

2541
02:15:28,120 --> 02:15:29,700
I have to reload this gun.

2542
02:15:30,460 --> 02:15:31,220
Wait, what?

2543
02:15:31,500 --> 02:15:34,420
Wait, what?!

2544
02:15:34,420 --> 02:15:37,440
There's so many dogs!

2545
02:15:42,990 --> 02:15:44,030
Okay, reload.

2546
02:15:45,810 --> 02:15:48,140
How many dogs do they have?!

2547
02:15:48,140 --> 02:15:49,620
How many dogs do they have?!

2548
02:15:51,260 --> 02:15:52,680
We're not, we're not, we're okay.

2549
02:15:53,660 --> 02:15:55,360
They don't know how to walk over.

2550
02:15:55,720 --> 02:15:56,060
No!

2551
02:15:56,900 --> 02:15:57,460
No!

2552
02:15:59,240 --> 02:16:02,910
Wait, I have to jump up?

2553
02:16:03,010 --> 02:16:03,530
Okay, wait.

2554
02:16:04,590 --> 02:16:05,430
Actually, I'm curious.

2555
02:16:05,710 --> 02:16:06,770
Can he actually go up?

2556
02:16:07,390 --> 02:16:09,010
Wait, I have to jump up?

2557
02:16:14,060 --> 02:16:14,620
No!

2558
02:16:15,060 --> 02:16:18,160
I don't like the sound they make!

2559
02:16:18,160 --> 02:16:22,000
I don't like it!

2560
02:16:22,700 --> 02:16:24,160
What the fuck?!

2561
02:16:25,380 --> 02:16:26,100
Okay, no.

2562
02:16:26,180 --> 02:16:26,980
Fuck you, actually.

2563
02:16:28,460 --> 02:16:29,520
There we go.

2564
02:16:31,740 --> 02:16:32,420
Stop!

2565
02:16:32,520 --> 02:16:33,600
Stop eating the bread!

2566
02:16:33,900 --> 02:16:34,380
Stop!

2567
02:16:35,000 --> 02:16:37,060
Stop eating the bread!

2568
02:16:42,510 --> 02:16:43,190
Okay.

2569
02:16:47,020 --> 02:16:48,200
Okay, we're fine.

2570
02:16:48,340 --> 02:16:49,400
That should be all the dogs.

2571
02:16:52,320 --> 02:16:53,200
Okay, nevermind.

2572
02:16:53,940 --> 02:16:56,020
That should, now that should be all the dogs.

2573
02:16:58,160 --> 02:16:59,040
Oh my god.

2574
02:16:59,140 --> 02:17:00,860
God, please, I need to stop eating the bread.

2575
02:17:01,320 --> 02:17:01,860
I need...

2576
02:17:03,180 --> 02:17:04,780
How do I re...

2577
02:17:04,780 --> 02:17:06,060
Okay, quick access.

2578
02:17:08,740 --> 02:17:09,840
How do I quick access?

2579
02:17:09,960 --> 02:17:11,060
No, no, not you!

2580
02:17:13,500 --> 02:17:13,940
Stop!

2581
02:17:14,080 --> 02:17:14,800
How do I...

2582
02:17:18,270 --> 02:17:19,330
Oh my god.

2583
02:17:19,330 --> 02:17:21,010
I'm stressed eating.

2584
02:17:21,210 --> 02:17:22,490
I'm so stressed out.

2585
02:17:22,550 --> 02:17:23,750
I keep eating bread.

2586
02:17:29,680 --> 02:17:30,180
Wait,

2587
02:17:41,800 --> 02:17:42,780
where's that one guy?

2588
02:17:45,620 --> 02:17:46,620
Did he die?

2589
02:17:46,840 --> 02:17:47,540
Did I kill him?

2590
02:17:55,040 --> 02:17:56,520
Yeah, you found me?

2591
02:18:02,940 --> 02:18:03,380
Nice.

2592
02:18:03,660 --> 02:18:04,160
I'm gonna go in.

2593
02:18:04,560 --> 02:18:05,240
I'm gonna run in.

2594
02:18:05,940 --> 02:18:06,700
It's gonna be a drive-by.

2595
02:18:06,840 --> 02:18:07,380
Wait, where did he go?

2596
02:18:07,520 --> 02:18:10,160
I told you.

2597
02:18:12,920 --> 02:18:14,120
I told you.

2598
02:18:15,900 --> 02:18:17,020
Is that it?

2599
02:18:19,340 --> 02:18:20,700
Loot that body.

2600
02:18:21,940 --> 02:18:23,460
Told you it was gonna be a drive-by.

2601
02:18:25,320 --> 02:18:26,780
Alright, nice, I did it.

2602
02:18:27,540 --> 02:18:28,320
Where did...

2603
02:18:28,320 --> 02:18:30,060
Where did all these dogs come from?

2604
02:18:31,420 --> 02:18:32,460
Holy shit.

2605
02:18:32,560 --> 02:18:33,540
Where did they keep...

2606
02:18:33,540 --> 02:18:35,180
They keep all those dogs.

2607
02:18:39,410 --> 02:18:40,870
Oh, that's not good.

2608
02:18:40,950 --> 02:18:42,010
Oh, that's not good.

2609
02:18:42,050 --> 02:18:43,010
I gotta drink some vodka.

2610
02:18:45,210 --> 02:18:45,730
Beer.

2611
02:18:47,930 --> 02:18:49,110
Am I okay now?

2612
02:18:49,270 --> 02:18:49,630
Beer.

2613
02:18:52,250 --> 02:18:54,090
Okay, I can drag this here.

2614
02:18:54,790 --> 02:18:55,790
Wait, no I can't.

2615
02:18:55,790 --> 02:18:57,790
How do I...

2616
02:19:01,340 --> 02:19:03,100
Oh, it's he...

2617
02:19:03,100 --> 02:19:04,740
Oh my god, I'm so stupid.

2618
02:19:05,140 --> 02:19:07,780
I'm so stupid.

2619
02:19:09,680 --> 02:19:11,820
Alright, unload my guns.

2620
02:19:12,900 --> 02:19:13,920
Alright, we're gonna...

2621
02:19:13,920 --> 02:19:14,580
Unload.

2622
02:19:16,600 --> 02:19:17,400
Unload.

2623
02:19:17,720 --> 02:19:18,260
Unload.

2624
02:19:20,840 --> 02:19:23,300
Okay, we should have...

2625
02:19:23,300 --> 02:19:24,420
Is everything unloaded?

2626
02:19:25,980 --> 02:19:26,500
Unload.

2627
02:19:26,820 --> 02:19:28,420
Nice, okay, everything is unloaded.

2628
02:19:30,100 --> 02:19:32,080
And then we'll reload this.

2629
02:19:34,440 --> 02:19:35,840
Oh, there's more boomstick.

2630
02:19:36,300 --> 02:19:38,920
Means that... Oh, okay, I should get rid of some guns.

2631
02:19:40,500 --> 02:19:41,020
Okay.

2632
02:19:41,460 --> 02:19:43,040
Alright, we'll drop this.

2633
02:19:45,060 --> 02:19:46,100
Drop all.

2634
02:19:51,740 --> 02:19:54,320
Wait, is it better than the one I have?

2635
02:19:54,420 --> 02:19:55,100
Are they different?

2636
02:19:55,100 --> 02:19:57,100
Wait, they're different?

2637
02:20:01,330 --> 02:20:02,010
Wait.

2638
02:20:03,310 --> 02:20:04,510
Are they different?

2639
02:20:07,730 --> 02:20:09,050
No, they're not.

2640
02:20:11,850 --> 02:20:13,290
Wait, they are?

2641
02:20:14,170 --> 02:20:15,030
Oh, shit.

2642
02:20:17,170 --> 02:20:19,010
Oh, only the durability.

2643
02:20:19,390 --> 02:20:19,910
Oh, okay.

2644
02:20:20,710 --> 02:20:22,170
Okay, I should replace...

2645
02:20:22,170 --> 02:20:23,130
Okay, they're all shit.

2646
02:20:23,610 --> 02:20:25,090
They're all like fucked up.

2647
02:20:25,090 --> 02:20:27,970
But why does it say 2 and 3?

2648
02:20:29,290 --> 02:20:31,690
Oh, I guess like this has more durability.

2649
02:20:33,410 --> 02:20:34,010
Oh!

2650
02:20:35,090 --> 02:20:36,330
Okay, I'm learning.

2651
02:20:39,490 --> 02:20:41,430
Oh, I see.

2652
02:20:44,390 --> 02:20:46,690
Same durability stacks.

2653
02:20:46,870 --> 02:20:47,170
Oh!

2654
02:20:48,850 --> 02:20:49,670
Okay.

2655
02:20:52,210 --> 02:20:54,070
Okay, that makes more sense.

2656
02:20:54,070 --> 02:20:55,930
I can have a suppressor.

2657
02:20:56,530 --> 02:20:58,510
I didn't notice I have a suppressor.

2658
02:21:01,730 --> 02:21:02,890
This is like Fallout.

2659
02:21:03,270 --> 02:21:04,830
Wait, this game is basically like Fallout.

2660
02:21:08,720 --> 02:21:10,600
Okay, I did this.

2661
02:21:13,320 --> 02:21:15,560
Okay, we gotta go here then.

2662
02:21:22,800 --> 02:21:23,820
It's not?

2663
02:21:24,240 --> 02:21:26,980
Wait, how would you compare this game...

2664
02:21:28,300 --> 02:21:28,940
...to...

2665
02:21:28,940 --> 02:21:29,840
...Fallout?

2666
02:21:29,840 --> 02:21:31,780
If it was good!

2667
02:21:36,900 --> 02:21:39,540
I guess it's like Metro, but open world.

2668
02:21:39,660 --> 02:21:40,660
Yeah, I can see that.

2669
02:21:41,300 --> 02:21:41,740
Yeah.

2670
02:21:44,340 --> 02:21:45,640
I can see this is like...

2671
02:21:45,640 --> 02:21:47,460
...Metro with like...

2672
02:21:47,460 --> 02:21:49,540
...open world stuff.

2673
02:21:51,320 --> 02:21:52,260
Okay, I'm retired.

2674
02:21:53,460 --> 02:21:56,060
My stamina is not as good as it used to be.

2675
02:22:00,200 --> 02:22:01,420
Okay, it's over there.

2676
02:22:01,640 --> 02:22:01,960
Alright.

2677
02:22:07,770 --> 02:22:09,250
Alright, let's reload...

2678
02:22:09,250 --> 02:22:09,970
...and then head over.

2679
02:22:11,230 --> 02:22:12,710
Can't be that hard to kill.

2680
02:22:15,030 --> 02:22:17,350
Why would I need to eat food in this game?

2681
02:22:17,770 --> 02:22:19,250
Like, what is the...

2682
02:22:19,250 --> 02:22:21,270
Do I even have like a food meter?

2683
02:22:33,720 --> 02:22:34,200
Hello?

2684
02:22:35,560 --> 02:22:36,580
Wait, am I hungry?

2685
02:22:40,290 --> 02:22:41,370
It's hard to tell...

2686
02:22:41,370 --> 02:22:43,350
...because I don't have like a food meter.

2687
02:22:47,120 --> 02:22:47,660
Is that where I am?

2688
02:22:47,920 --> 02:22:49,440
Is that what the chicken is?

2689
02:22:50,500 --> 02:22:52,140
Oh my god, I'm hungry!

2690
02:22:52,620 --> 02:22:53,880
I didn't realize!

2691
02:22:54,040 --> 02:22:55,220
Oh my god, it's gone!

2692
02:22:58,020 --> 02:22:59,840
Oh my god, I was hungry!

2693
02:22:59,980 --> 02:23:01,100
It's gone now!

2694
02:23:03,400 --> 02:23:04,500
Okay, let's...

2695
02:23:04,500 --> 02:23:06,060
I guess I'll drop this...

2696
02:23:06,060 --> 02:23:08,820
...since I'm...

2697
02:23:11,340 --> 02:23:12,220
I didn't know!

2698
02:23:15,390 --> 02:23:15,680
Okay.

2699
02:23:15,680 --> 02:23:15,880
Okay.

2700
02:23:20,450 --> 02:23:22,310
Let's see, we got more stuff.

2701
02:23:24,970 --> 02:23:25,370
Hello?

2702
02:23:27,250 --> 02:23:27,650
Wait.

2703
02:23:27,990 --> 02:23:29,510
There's a lot of dead people here.

2704
02:23:31,550 --> 02:23:33,630
Why is there a lot of dead people here?

2705
02:23:34,830 --> 02:23:35,230
Squint!

2706
02:23:35,330 --> 02:23:36,970
What are you doing down in the mines?

2707
02:23:37,590 --> 02:23:37,990
Squint!

2708
02:23:38,510 --> 02:23:39,410
Oh, not the mines.

2709
02:23:39,610 --> 02:23:41,230
Why did you take me to the mines?

2710
02:23:41,330 --> 02:23:42,510
You fucking fool.

2711
02:23:45,550 --> 02:23:46,390
Dogs.

2712
02:23:47,650 --> 02:23:48,970
There's mean dogs.

2713
02:23:49,130 --> 02:23:50,050
There's evil dogs.

2714
02:23:51,590 --> 02:23:52,650
Wait, where?

2715
02:23:56,640 --> 02:23:58,240
Where are the dogs?

2716
02:24:00,900 --> 02:24:01,280
Hello?

2717
02:24:03,160 --> 02:24:04,960
Oh my god.

2718
02:24:05,060 --> 02:24:06,660
How the fuck am I gonna get to...

2719
02:24:10,820 --> 02:24:11,240
How?!

2720
02:24:14,760 --> 02:24:15,240
Okay.

2721
02:24:16,820 --> 02:24:18,640
Alright, I actually do have to thread the needle.

2722
02:24:19,980 --> 02:24:21,420
Oh, this is scary.

2723
02:24:22,680 --> 02:24:23,840
Okay, we made it.

2724
02:24:25,580 --> 02:24:26,060
Okay.

2725
02:24:26,620 --> 02:24:28,700
How the fuck was he able to make it all the way here?

2726
02:24:35,930 --> 02:24:36,910
Alright, nice.

2727
02:24:39,210 --> 02:24:40,390
Wait, there he is.

2728
02:24:44,160 --> 02:24:45,480
Alright, dog down.

2729
02:24:50,570 --> 02:24:51,710
Oh, oh, wait.

2730
02:24:51,870 --> 02:24:52,970
Oh wait, they're fighting each other.

2731
02:24:53,910 --> 02:24:55,530
Oh, they're fighting the dogs.

2732
02:25:01,920 --> 02:25:02,300
Okay.

2733
02:25:03,560 --> 02:25:05,180
Wait, isn't this where I came from?

2734
02:25:05,280 --> 02:25:07,520
Oh no, this is the death creator.

2735
02:25:08,320 --> 02:25:09,800
That's good, they're fighting the dogs.

2736
02:25:09,860 --> 02:25:10,860
I don't have to worry about them.

2737
02:25:13,580 --> 02:25:15,280
If I shoot them here, will they come over?

2738
02:25:15,500 --> 02:25:16,460
Guys, they're coming over.

2739
02:25:24,910 --> 02:25:26,610
It's okay, the dogs got him.

2740
02:25:26,610 --> 02:25:28,350
Oh, shit!

2741
02:25:33,060 --> 02:25:33,780
Okay!

2742
02:25:34,480 --> 02:25:35,200
Dogs!

2743
02:25:37,080 --> 02:25:38,260
Oh, shit!

2744
02:25:45,810 --> 02:25:47,290
Is he an evil man?

2745
02:25:48,930 --> 02:25:50,230
Are they good people?

2746
02:25:50,690 --> 02:25:52,210
Oh, they're good people, they're good people.

2747
02:25:53,030 --> 02:25:53,590
They're friendly.

2748
02:25:55,570 --> 02:25:56,150
Hello!

2749
02:25:59,110 --> 02:26:00,270
Oh, shit.

2750
02:26:00,270 --> 02:26:01,710
Oh, shit!

2751
02:26:01,970 --> 02:26:02,870
There's friendly fire!

2752
02:26:03,590 --> 02:26:05,910
Nobody told me there's friendly fire!

2753
02:26:11,310 --> 02:26:12,510
Alright, we gotta...

2754
02:26:12,510 --> 02:26:14,210
Yeah, we gotta do our radiation stuff.

2755
02:26:14,630 --> 02:26:15,630
Radiation check.

2756
02:26:17,550 --> 02:26:18,210
Uh...

2757
02:26:18,210 --> 02:26:19,570
What is...

2758
02:26:19,570 --> 02:26:21,850
Okay, we gotta put it in the beer category.

2759
02:26:26,260 --> 02:26:27,020
Oh, thank god.

2760
02:26:27,160 --> 02:26:27,480
Okay.

2761
02:26:30,260 --> 02:26:31,540
Who are you?

2762
02:26:31,540 --> 02:26:31,600
Hello.

2763
02:26:32,040 --> 02:26:33,440
Are there other stalkers?

2764
02:26:36,260 --> 02:26:37,400
Are there other stalkers?

2765
02:26:46,710 --> 02:26:49,790
Bro, they fucking...

2766
02:26:52,030 --> 02:26:53,190
What do you mean?

2767
02:26:53,610 --> 02:26:54,470
He fucking...

2768
02:26:54,470 --> 02:26:55,610
He shot first!

2769
02:26:57,850 --> 02:27:00,590
Okay, where is...

2770
02:27:00,590 --> 02:27:01,670
Where is he?

2771
02:27:02,670 --> 02:27:03,550
Where's Squint?

2772
02:27:05,710 --> 02:27:06,430
Where's Squint?

2773
02:27:06,490 --> 02:27:07,210
Might be hiding.

2774
02:27:07,330 --> 02:27:09,350
I swear, I like, looked everywhere.

2775
02:27:11,390 --> 02:27:12,890
Am I missing something?

2776
02:27:21,070 --> 02:27:22,310
Where could he be hiding?

2777
02:27:27,840 --> 02:27:29,380
Where are you hiding?

2778
02:27:33,200 --> 02:27:35,220
Oh, you think you can get away from me, don't you?

2779
02:27:35,960 --> 02:27:38,200
Oh, you think you can get away from me, Squint?

2780
02:27:38,940 --> 02:27:40,460
This is where I went down.

2781
02:27:41,360 --> 02:27:43,520
Is he actually still in the attic?

2782
02:27:45,300 --> 02:27:46,700
Maybe I didn't look properly.

2783
02:27:47,340 --> 02:27:48,920
I mean, it is like the mines.

2784
02:27:51,820 --> 02:27:53,480
Maybe he's actually still in here.

2785
02:27:55,740 --> 02:27:58,020
I don't know if I like, searched it properly.

2786
02:28:03,890 --> 02:28:05,790
Oh, sorry, attic is up.

2787
02:28:09,390 --> 02:28:09,910
Whoops.

2788
02:28:09,910 --> 02:28:10,170
Whoops.

2789
02:28:12,110 --> 02:28:14,150
Well, I can't go back down.

2790
02:28:14,410 --> 02:28:16,010
I can't go back up.

2791
02:28:17,830 --> 02:28:19,010
Up is down.

2792
02:28:19,150 --> 02:28:20,330
I don't know if you guys know that.

2793
02:28:20,750 --> 02:28:21,330
But up...

2794
02:28:21,330 --> 02:28:23,210
I gotta do this stupid thing all over again.

2795
02:28:23,930 --> 02:28:24,770
God damn it.

2796
02:28:24,950 --> 02:28:28,670
I have to do this all over again.

2797
02:28:28,750 --> 02:28:29,070
Whoops.

2798
02:28:33,000 --> 02:28:34,220
Alright, it's fine.

2799
02:28:34,400 --> 02:28:35,420
I mastered it.

2800
02:28:37,020 --> 02:28:39,000
Welcome to the zone, Doki.

2801
02:28:39,000 --> 02:28:41,420
Thank you for your very first super chat.

2802
02:28:42,020 --> 02:28:42,840
Thank you.

2803
02:28:44,740 --> 02:28:46,200
Alright, up is down.

2804
02:28:48,760 --> 02:28:50,660
Guys, let me find Squint first.

2805
02:28:50,800 --> 02:28:52,460
I gotta find Squint.

2806
02:28:53,020 --> 02:28:54,600
Wait, who's fighting again?

2807
02:28:56,120 --> 02:28:57,260
Wait, what?

2808
02:28:59,000 --> 02:29:00,580
What's going on?

2809
02:29:02,780 --> 02:29:04,000
I just got here.

2810
02:29:05,380 --> 02:29:06,660
Let me do that.

2811
02:29:06,660 --> 02:29:09,020
I'm trying to find...

2812
02:29:10,970 --> 02:29:13,030
What's going on?

2813
02:29:19,320 --> 02:29:19,980
Squint.

2814
02:29:22,260 --> 02:29:24,160
Squint, where are you hiding?

2815
02:29:28,440 --> 02:29:29,220
Squint.

2816
02:29:30,960 --> 02:29:33,100
Where the fuck are you hiding?

2817
02:29:35,480 --> 02:29:37,040
Okay, still the good people.

2818
02:29:40,130 --> 02:29:40,940
Oh, free loot.

2819
02:29:44,580 --> 02:29:45,060
Nice.

2820
02:29:47,440 --> 02:29:49,720
Why have I not looted yet?

2821
02:29:51,460 --> 02:29:52,780
I can't tell, guys.

2822
02:29:52,880 --> 02:29:53,960
They all look the same.

2823
02:29:59,810 --> 02:30:01,230
Everything looks the same, guys.

2824
02:30:01,310 --> 02:30:03,990
I can't tell what I haven't looted yet.

2825
02:30:15,630 --> 02:30:16,590
Oh, shit!

2826
02:30:17,250 --> 02:30:19,470
I thought they were the same helpful people!

2827
02:30:33,410 --> 02:30:34,330
Oh my god, please.

2828
02:30:34,390 --> 02:30:35,810
I'm still trying to find Squint.

2829
02:30:35,810 --> 02:30:38,490
Please, where is he?

2830
02:30:38,930 --> 02:30:39,810
Is he in the...

2831
02:30:39,810 --> 02:30:41,550
Oh my god, I swear to god.

2832
02:30:41,570 --> 02:30:44,150
If he was in the windmill this entire time...

2833
02:30:44,150 --> 02:30:45,870
I swear to fucking god.

2834
02:30:46,650 --> 02:30:48,850
Wait, the friendly stalkers are dead?

2835
02:30:48,970 --> 02:30:50,510
Okay, we just go to the windmill.

2836
02:30:54,100 --> 02:30:55,660
Alright, we got...

2837
02:30:56,460 --> 02:30:58,280
Okay, I think they're in the windmill.

2838
02:30:58,380 --> 02:30:59,440
I think he's in the windmill.

2839
02:30:59,780 --> 02:31:01,240
I think he's hiding in there.

2840
02:31:02,780 --> 02:31:03,800
Alright, let's drop...

2841
02:31:03,800 --> 02:31:05,260
Drop bad things.

2842
02:31:07,580 --> 02:31:08,060
Unload...

2843
02:31:08,060 --> 02:31:09,440
Oh wait, that's a better gun.

2844
02:31:11,980 --> 02:31:12,460
Drop...

2845
02:31:12,460 --> 02:31:13,280
Drop...

2846
02:31:13,280 --> 02:31:13,740
There we go.

2847
02:31:16,120 --> 02:31:17,260
And then we gotta...

2848
02:31:18,980 --> 02:31:19,840
Gotta drink.

2849
02:31:20,680 --> 02:31:22,020
Drink our vodka.

2850
02:31:26,810 --> 02:31:27,750
I know you're in here.

2851
02:31:28,790 --> 02:31:30,250
I know you're in here, Squint.

2852
02:31:30,490 --> 02:31:30,850
Woah!

2853
02:31:31,050 --> 02:31:31,270
Woah!

2854
02:31:40,480 --> 02:31:42,000
I fucking knew it.

2855
02:31:42,540 --> 02:31:43,740
I fucking knew it.

2856
02:31:43,740 --> 02:31:45,300
Oh, I'm coming over, Squint.

2857
02:31:45,860 --> 02:31:47,040
I'm coming over.

2858
02:31:48,020 --> 02:31:50,940
I don't know where you are, but I'm coming over.

2859
02:31:52,220 --> 02:31:54,540
Oh, you thought you got me this time?

2860
02:31:57,480 --> 02:31:59,720
Squint, where are you, Squint?

2861
02:32:01,780 --> 02:32:02,900
Oh, Squint!

2862
02:32:10,400 --> 02:32:12,180
That's fucking right, you nerd.

2863
02:32:13,460 --> 02:32:14,740
That's right.

2864
02:32:26,480 --> 02:32:27,440
Where's the window?

2865
02:32:27,440 --> 02:32:27,600
Where's the window?

2866
02:32:32,620 --> 02:32:33,820
Oh no!

2867
02:32:34,200 --> 02:32:35,600
He fell down the window!

2868
02:32:39,260 --> 02:32:40,060
Oh no!

2869
02:32:41,180 --> 02:32:42,820
He fell down the window!

2870
02:32:44,160 --> 02:32:50,720
Oh no!

2871
02:32:51,240 --> 02:32:52,700
Oh no, yes!

2872
02:32:57,860 --> 02:33:00,060
He said I could kill him!

2873
02:33:03,500 --> 02:33:06,060
He said I could kill him!

2874
02:33:06,620 --> 02:33:09,160
He said it was fine to kill him!

2875
02:33:11,040 --> 02:33:12,240
Oh no!

2876
02:33:13,360 --> 02:33:14,640
Window, no!

2877
02:33:14,840 --> 02:33:16,440
He fell down the window!

2878
02:33:18,480 --> 02:33:20,300
After 20 bullets.

2879
02:33:20,880 --> 02:33:22,920
Wow, that was just...

2880
02:33:22,920 --> 02:33:25,540
It was totally blameless.

2881
02:33:29,380 --> 02:33:31,440
Johnny, thank you for the super chat.

2882
02:33:31,500 --> 02:33:32,660
Thank you, thank you.

2883
02:33:32,780 --> 02:33:35,380
Oh my god, that's so unfortunate!

2884
02:33:36,680 --> 02:33:40,640
Oh my god, I can't believe the window got him!

2885
02:33:42,920 --> 02:33:44,600
Oh my god!

2886
02:33:47,260 --> 02:33:51,200
Because I wanted to be in the ward faction anyway, guys.

2887
02:33:53,380 --> 02:33:54,980
I guess I'm a ward now.

2888
02:33:55,520 --> 02:33:57,400
I mean, ward is not too bad.

2889
02:33:57,400 --> 02:33:58,640
They seem cool.

2890
02:33:59,800 --> 02:34:03,320
People just happen to fall from the window a lot!

2891
02:34:05,660 --> 02:34:11,460
I can't believe he dropped his gun and it shot him in the face.

2892
02:34:14,020 --> 02:34:17,980
Guys, he tripped and it triggered the gun.

2893
02:34:18,260 --> 02:34:20,020
Like, can you really blame me?

2894
02:34:23,440 --> 02:34:24,800
We got...

2895
02:34:25,600 --> 02:34:26,940
We did it!

2896
02:34:27,400 --> 02:34:28,820
We got the censors!

2897
02:34:30,020 --> 02:34:32,400
Guys, we did it!

2898
02:34:33,940 --> 02:34:36,580
Guys, we're truly in Eastern Europe now.

2899
02:34:40,940 --> 02:34:43,060
We're in EU!

2900
02:34:44,060 --> 02:34:44,900
We're in EU!

2901
02:34:51,750 --> 02:34:53,930
Look, all I'm saying is he did shot first.

2902
02:34:55,450 --> 02:34:58,030
We're going by...

2903
02:34:58,030 --> 02:34:58,210
Whoa.

2904
02:35:02,760 --> 02:35:03,320
Bad.

2905
02:35:04,980 --> 02:35:06,100
Bad anomaly.

2906
02:35:07,240 --> 02:35:10,260
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

2907
02:35:10,620 --> 02:35:14,360
This looks like a lot of bad anomalies.

2908
02:35:19,160 --> 02:35:21,280
How the fuck do I get home?

2909
02:35:24,430 --> 02:35:27,150
Okay, I don't know if this is the right time to just sit there.

2910
02:35:27,150 --> 02:35:28,210
But like, okay.

2911
02:35:32,540 --> 02:35:34,960
Guys, he shot first.

2912
02:35:35,060 --> 02:35:35,520
Guys.

2913
02:35:38,440 --> 02:35:40,040
How do I get home?

2914
02:35:43,380 --> 02:35:45,680
Okay, we go down and then left.

2915
02:35:45,800 --> 02:35:46,020
Okay.

2916
02:35:48,600 --> 02:35:49,300
Whoa!

2917
02:35:49,900 --> 02:35:50,560
Bad anomaly!

2918
02:35:51,220 --> 02:35:51,840
Bad!

2919
02:35:52,670 --> 02:35:53,360
Bad anomaly!

2920
02:35:54,340 --> 02:35:55,420
Oh my God!

2921
02:35:55,420 --> 02:35:59,850
Oh my God!

2922
02:36:03,310 --> 02:36:03,710
Oh my God!

2923
02:36:03,710 --> 02:36:05,310
Wait, where's my last save?

2924
02:36:05,630 --> 02:36:07,790
Where's my last save?

2925
02:36:09,030 --> 02:36:12,530
Where'd it go?

2926
02:36:12,970 --> 02:36:14,950
Oh, where did I go?

2927
02:36:15,430 --> 02:36:16,690
Where did I go?

2928
02:36:19,550 --> 02:36:20,530
Oh shit, again.

2929
02:36:21,250 --> 02:36:22,090
Oh shit.

2930
02:36:26,970 --> 02:36:29,350
Alright, we gotta do this again.

2931
02:36:29,350 --> 02:36:31,690
Oh man, it's...

2932
02:36:31,690 --> 02:36:35,270
It's so unfortunate that he fell from the window.

2933
02:36:36,170 --> 02:36:36,630
Whoa!

2934
02:36:37,510 --> 02:36:38,350
Oh my God!

2935
02:36:38,990 --> 02:36:40,710
Oh my God!

2936
02:36:40,970 --> 02:36:42,190
Oh my God!

2937
02:36:42,370 --> 02:36:43,210
But it's okay.

2938
02:36:43,630 --> 02:36:44,170
He was...

2939
02:36:44,170 --> 02:36:50,510
He was alive, but then he tripped and fell from the window again!

2940
02:36:51,130 --> 02:36:52,290
Oh shit, wait, wait.

2941
02:36:53,190 --> 02:36:57,330
Then he tripped and then he...

2942
02:36:58,250 --> 02:37:00,290
He fell from the window again.

2943
02:37:00,370 --> 02:37:01,950
Oh my God, that is so unfortunate.

2944
02:37:02,430 --> 02:37:03,410
That is so...

2945
02:37:03,410 --> 02:37:04,430
I can't believe it.

2946
02:37:04,590 --> 02:37:05,610
He was so clumsy!

2947
02:37:06,450 --> 02:37:07,430
It was so...

2948
02:37:07,430 --> 02:37:08,830
It was so tragic.

2949
02:37:09,330 --> 02:37:10,330
It really was.

2950
02:37:12,990 --> 02:37:15,970
It really was incredibly tragic.

2951
02:37:16,210 --> 02:37:17,990
Oh man, I wish I was there to stop it.

2952
02:37:18,350 --> 02:37:19,370
That's so sad.

2953
02:37:20,230 --> 02:37:21,210
I'm so sad.

2954
02:37:21,370 --> 02:37:23,370
I could do nothing to stop it.

2955
02:37:26,110 --> 02:37:27,450
It's so unfortunate.

2956
02:37:28,070 --> 02:37:28,650
It's so unfortunate.

2957
02:37:28,650 --> 02:37:30,670
And then, like, the windmill burned down too after.

2958
02:37:31,010 --> 02:37:32,170
Like, wow, so unfortunate.

2959
02:37:33,190 --> 02:37:33,770
Gone.

2960
02:37:36,010 --> 02:37:37,650
Such is the life in the zone.

2961
02:37:37,930 --> 02:37:38,230
Yep.

2962
02:37:39,610 --> 02:37:41,670
Just another day in the zone.

2963
02:37:41,870 --> 02:37:43,310
Nothing could have prevented this.

2964
02:37:43,390 --> 02:37:43,870
Exactly!

2965
02:37:45,150 --> 02:37:47,990
Like, nothing could have prevented it, guys.

2966
02:37:48,510 --> 02:37:51,010
It was simply life in the zone.

2967
02:37:55,410 --> 02:37:57,550
Oh my God, I'm like a little paranoid right now.

2968
02:37:57,770 --> 02:37:59,010
I'm a little crazy.

2969
02:38:01,950 --> 02:38:03,170
What is that sound?

2970
02:38:04,990 --> 02:38:06,770
This is how I died last time.

2971
02:38:07,370 --> 02:38:08,510
Wait, that's it?

2972
02:38:09,670 --> 02:38:11,490
Wait, isn't that how I died last time?

2973
02:38:14,290 --> 02:38:16,210
Wait, that is how I died last time.

2974
02:38:16,830 --> 02:38:17,850
Oh my God.

2975
02:38:18,390 --> 02:38:19,850
Oh my God, how do I get home?

2976
02:38:19,910 --> 02:38:20,870
I'm always lost.

2977
02:38:21,870 --> 02:38:23,230
Like, which way?

2978
02:38:23,970 --> 02:38:25,310
Okay, it's this way.

2979
02:38:27,050 --> 02:38:29,950
Oh my God, there's so many weird anomalies.

2980
02:38:33,150 --> 02:38:35,690
Like, I can't go anywhere here.

2981
02:38:39,770 --> 02:38:41,030
Oh, there's a bridge.

2982
02:38:41,570 --> 02:38:42,170
Be gone!

2983
02:38:44,850 --> 02:38:45,070
Oh.

2984
02:38:47,060 --> 02:38:48,190
Wait, there's an artifact here.

2985
02:38:48,870 --> 02:38:49,950
Not again!

2986
02:38:50,550 --> 02:38:51,410
Not again!

2987
02:38:51,910 --> 02:38:52,310
Oh.

2988
02:38:53,210 --> 02:38:54,110
Not again!

2989
02:38:54,350 --> 02:38:54,710
Not again!

2990
02:38:54,770 --> 02:38:55,170
Not again!

2991
02:38:55,190 --> 02:38:55,610
I'm sorry!

2992
02:38:55,750 --> 02:38:56,090
I'm sorry!

2993
02:38:56,210 --> 02:38:56,770
I'm sorry!

2994
02:38:58,550 --> 02:38:59,730
I'm so sorry.

2995
02:39:00,050 --> 02:39:01,170
I'm so sorry.

2996
02:39:01,450 --> 02:39:02,670
I'm on the road now.

2997
02:39:04,190 --> 02:39:05,530
I'm on the road.

2998
02:39:07,410 --> 02:39:08,490
I survived.

2999
02:39:11,110 --> 02:39:13,090
Nothing can hurt me.

3000
02:39:13,630 --> 02:39:15,310
Nothing can hurt me.

3001
02:39:15,930 --> 02:39:16,410
Nothing.

3002
02:39:16,630 --> 02:39:16,930
Oh.

3003
02:39:18,410 --> 02:39:19,730
Oh, okay.

3004
02:39:19,730 --> 02:39:20,870
I've run.

3005
02:39:21,950 --> 02:39:22,510
I've run.

3006
02:39:23,130 --> 02:39:24,010
Alright, we're fine.

3007
02:39:25,350 --> 02:39:25,930
We're fine.

3008
02:39:26,650 --> 02:39:27,470
Follow the road.

3009
02:39:27,990 --> 02:39:29,270
Wait, where did home go?

3010
02:39:30,130 --> 02:39:31,310
Wait, where did home go?

3011
02:39:32,210 --> 02:39:32,730
Wait.

3012
02:39:33,170 --> 02:39:34,170
Oh, it's right in front of me.

3013
02:39:34,230 --> 02:39:34,450
Okay.

3014
02:39:37,690 --> 02:39:38,790
It's right in front of me.

3015
02:39:39,990 --> 02:39:40,510
Okay.

3016
02:39:40,510 --> 02:39:41,590
Oh, I hate.

3017
02:39:41,770 --> 02:39:42,730
I hate this.

3018
02:39:43,250 --> 02:39:45,010
I hate this so much.

3019
02:39:45,590 --> 02:39:47,150
Oh, I hate this.

3020
02:39:48,290 --> 02:39:49,370
I hate this.

3021
02:39:49,470 --> 02:39:51,050
If I keep throwing it, nothing...

3022
02:39:51,050 --> 02:39:53,390
They can't get me if I keep throwing this.

3023
02:39:53,690 --> 02:39:55,250
They can't get me.

3024
02:39:57,770 --> 02:39:58,530
Oh, I'm here.

3025
02:39:58,890 --> 02:39:59,690
I'm here now.

3026
02:40:00,670 --> 02:40:01,750
I did it, Warden.

3027
02:40:02,050 --> 02:40:03,810
I did it, Wards.

3028
02:40:05,190 --> 02:40:06,210
I killed him.

3029
02:40:06,910 --> 02:40:08,750
I mean, he fell from the window.

3030
02:40:10,670 --> 02:40:11,150
Sorry.

3031
02:40:11,350 --> 02:40:11,590
Sorry.

3032
02:40:11,670 --> 02:40:13,110
It was like a slip of tongue.

3033
02:40:13,530 --> 02:40:13,870
Sorry.

3034
02:40:14,070 --> 02:40:14,370
Sorry.

3035
02:40:14,370 --> 02:40:16,570
Nothing bad happened.

3036
02:40:16,690 --> 02:40:19,050
He just fell through the window.

3037
02:40:22,170 --> 02:40:22,650
Sorry.

3038
02:40:22,910 --> 02:40:24,510
It's just a mental typo.

3039
02:40:24,930 --> 02:40:26,510
The mental typo, you know.

3040
02:40:28,650 --> 02:40:29,470
Hey guys, sorry.

3041
02:40:29,610 --> 02:40:30,650
He fell down the window.

3042
02:40:30,810 --> 02:40:32,250
There was nothing I could do to save him.

3043
02:40:39,360 --> 02:40:42,440
Wait, do I give this to him?

3044
02:40:42,660 --> 02:40:44,300
Wait, I have the sensors.

3045
02:40:44,300 --> 02:40:48,520
So I can pick to either give it to Richard or the Wards, right?

3046
02:40:49,920 --> 02:40:52,300
So that I could pick one or the other, right?

3047
02:40:57,040 --> 02:40:58,160
Or like...

3048
02:40:58,160 --> 02:40:58,680
Yeah?

3049
02:41:00,360 --> 02:41:01,660
Oh, it's my choice?

3050
02:41:02,080 --> 02:41:02,340
Alright.

3051
02:41:04,680 --> 02:41:04,940
Oh.

3052
02:41:07,320 --> 02:41:09,500
Okay, but like who would give the better...

3053
02:41:11,180 --> 02:41:14,500
Who would give the better loot though, guys?

3054
02:41:14,560 --> 02:41:15,520
Because he doesn't know.

3055
02:41:15,520 --> 02:41:18,900
I mean, he knows that it was an accident.

3056
02:41:19,360 --> 02:41:20,920
But like...

3057
02:41:20,920 --> 02:41:23,360
Who would be the better one?

3058
02:41:24,080 --> 02:41:26,000
Do I give it to the Wards or Richard?

3059
02:41:27,560 --> 02:41:28,840
Also, I need to use the bathroom.

3060
02:41:28,980 --> 02:41:30,900
You guys, make the choice for me.

3061
02:42:28,340 --> 02:42:29,700
Look at that radiation!

3062
02:42:31,740 --> 02:42:33,960
It's not a sickness, it's a feature.

3063
02:42:34,660 --> 02:42:35,660
That's different.

3064
02:42:36,400 --> 02:42:37,500
It's not a sickness.

3065
02:42:37,880 --> 02:42:38,180
Okay.

3066
02:42:38,180 --> 02:42:39,520
Alright, guys.

3067
02:42:39,600 --> 02:42:41,080
Have we made our choice?

3068
02:42:41,360 --> 02:42:42,560
What are we going for?

3069
02:42:43,360 --> 02:42:45,540
The Wards or Richard?

3070
02:42:46,000 --> 02:42:49,200
I don't even know what his faction is called.

3071
02:42:52,410 --> 02:42:53,870
What are we going for?

3072
02:42:54,050 --> 02:42:55,770
The Wards or Richard?

3073
02:42:56,750 --> 02:42:58,630
I mean, he's just Richard.

3074
02:43:00,010 --> 02:43:01,210
Gun or armor?

3075
02:43:01,790 --> 02:43:02,390
Okay, wait.

3076
02:43:02,550 --> 02:43:03,930
Maybe armor would be...

3077
02:43:07,190 --> 02:43:08,150
The Wards?

3078
02:43:09,830 --> 02:43:10,910
Alright, Ward time.

3079
02:43:11,130 --> 02:43:12,410
I saw more people...

3080
02:43:12,410 --> 02:43:13,950
See, I'm not a bad person.

3081
02:43:14,050 --> 02:43:15,370
You guys also picked the Wards.

3082
02:43:15,950 --> 02:43:19,030
How am I a bad person if you guys also picked this option?

3083
02:43:20,270 --> 02:43:22,390
That says more about you guys than me.

3084
02:43:22,790 --> 02:43:27,370
Okay, I'll give you guys a fair vote.

3085
02:43:28,890 --> 02:43:29,130
Alright.

3086
02:43:31,670 --> 02:43:34,070
The Wardens or the Nerds.

3087
02:43:37,350 --> 02:43:37,950
Alright.

3088
02:43:38,150 --> 02:43:38,550
There you go.

3089
02:43:38,610 --> 02:43:40,050
There's your fair option.

3090
02:43:40,790 --> 02:43:42,910
There it is.

3091
02:43:46,690 --> 02:43:47,030
Ow.

3092
02:43:47,210 --> 02:43:47,670
Oh my god.

3093
02:43:47,710 --> 02:43:49,170
Did I get the barbed wire again?

3094
02:43:49,290 --> 02:43:49,990
Fucking hell.

3095
02:43:54,450 --> 02:43:55,050
Ew.

3096
02:43:56,690 --> 02:43:57,290
Nerds!

3097
02:44:02,470 --> 02:44:06,890
How dare you call the free stockers nerds?

3098
02:44:07,010 --> 02:44:08,870
Easy answer.

3099
02:44:11,130 --> 02:44:11,810
Oh my god.

3100
02:44:11,850 --> 02:44:12,930
The nerds are winning?

3101
02:44:13,390 --> 02:44:15,090
Do I have nerds watching my stream?

3102
02:44:18,470 --> 02:44:20,010
This is a psych-ops.

3103
02:44:25,700 --> 02:44:29,970
There is a sign showing I'm a nerd.

3104
02:44:32,590 --> 02:44:34,830
Don't keep it I'm a nerd.

3105
02:44:35,270 --> 02:44:36,650
Don't say that.

3106
02:44:37,350 --> 02:44:40,590
I'm picking nerds to spite you.

3107
02:44:42,110 --> 02:44:42,990
Okay.

3108
02:44:44,210 --> 02:44:44,730
Alright.

3109
02:44:45,230 --> 02:44:49,950
So we're picking Let's see.

3110
02:44:50,130 --> 02:44:55,190
So we're picking uh Alright.

3111
02:44:55,330 --> 02:44:59,210
So we're gonna pick the nerd faction.

3112
02:44:59,610 --> 02:45:00,450
I guess.

3113
02:45:00,450 --> 02:45:02,110
They don't know, guys.

3114
02:45:02,250 --> 02:45:05,930
They don't know what happened to Oh my god.

3115
02:45:06,190 --> 02:45:07,170
I gotta heal up.

3116
02:45:08,230 --> 02:45:09,910
They don't know what happened to that guy.

3117
02:45:10,190 --> 02:45:10,910
So we're safe.

3118
02:45:11,750 --> 02:45:13,230
They just think that he fell out the window.

3119
02:45:13,390 --> 02:45:15,830
And that's the story we're gonna go with, chat.

3120
02:45:19,150 --> 02:45:19,490
Alright.

3121
02:45:19,630 --> 02:45:20,270
Here we go.

3122
02:45:21,630 --> 02:45:22,070
Alright.

3123
02:45:26,720 --> 02:45:27,160
Hello.

3124
02:45:27,360 --> 02:45:28,440
Oh, I should get some food.

3125
02:45:29,600 --> 02:45:30,580
No, that's my iPad.

3126
02:45:30,580 --> 02:45:33,260
I should open my food inventory.

3127
02:45:33,900 --> 02:45:34,420
Alright.

3128
02:45:34,660 --> 02:45:37,560
Gotta eat that sausage so I'm not as hungry.

3129
02:45:38,500 --> 02:45:38,780
Alright.

3130
02:45:39,580 --> 02:45:40,900
Oh wait, I got another sausage.

3131
02:45:41,160 --> 02:45:41,440
Nice.

3132
02:45:42,800 --> 02:45:43,060
Hello.

3133
02:45:47,220 --> 02:45:47,960
Yeah, yeah.

3134
02:45:48,040 --> 02:45:49,140
We found him.

3135
02:45:49,260 --> 02:45:50,340
Can you tell me about the squint?

3136
02:45:51,780 --> 02:45:52,640
Yeah, is he a friend?

3137
02:45:57,540 --> 02:45:58,740
See, used to.

3138
02:46:02,240 --> 02:46:03,320
Used to.

3139
02:46:03,480 --> 02:46:04,520
They're not close anymore.

3140
02:46:05,160 --> 02:46:06,640
So I'm less guilty.

3141
02:46:11,200 --> 02:46:11,920
See?

3142
02:46:12,360 --> 02:46:13,220
He's crazy.

3143
02:46:15,220 --> 02:46:17,480
He cares about the censors more than him.

3144
02:46:21,820 --> 02:46:23,180
I'm not punished.

3145
02:46:26,360 --> 02:46:27,880
Now I have zero guilt.

3146
02:46:33,180 --> 02:46:33,840
Alright.

3147
02:46:34,200 --> 02:46:35,680
Anyway, here's your censors.

3148
02:46:54,110 --> 02:46:55,830
Is that all you know?

3149
02:46:56,030 --> 02:46:56,390
Yeah.

3150
02:47:02,430 --> 02:47:03,370
I didn't kill him.

3151
02:47:03,430 --> 02:47:04,510
He fell out the window.

3152
02:47:05,390 --> 02:47:06,370
Guys, it was...

3153
02:47:06,370 --> 02:47:08,430
I saw him fall out the window.

3154
02:47:14,330 --> 02:47:16,070
We're all looking for anomalies!

3155
02:47:16,630 --> 02:47:18,410
Is there something we're not looking for?

3156
02:47:19,430 --> 02:47:19,930
Like...

3157
02:47:19,930 --> 02:47:22,690
What do you mean, what was I doing there?

3158
02:47:22,970 --> 02:47:23,450
I'm...

3159
02:47:23,450 --> 02:47:25,810
Are we all looking for anomalies?

3160
02:47:26,730 --> 02:47:27,230
Like...

3161
02:47:32,430 --> 02:47:34,690
Yeah, I remember that little performance.

3162
02:47:35,390 --> 02:47:36,810
You could see it from the post office.

3163
02:47:37,010 --> 02:47:37,810
Clear as day.

3164
02:47:38,370 --> 02:47:40,290
I should have known you had a hand in it.

3165
02:47:40,670 --> 02:47:41,830
But we're getting off topic.

3166
02:47:42,370 --> 02:47:46,310
Taking the sphere by storm would be even dumber than walking into the zone without any bolts.

3167
02:47:46,950 --> 02:47:48,890
I strongly advise against this course of action.

3168
02:47:49,570 --> 02:47:50,790
But, I've got an idea.

3169
02:47:51,650 --> 02:47:51,850
What?

3170
02:47:52,290 --> 02:47:53,530
Wait, why are you helping me?

3171
02:47:53,670 --> 02:47:54,930
And I'm supposed to believe that?

3172
02:47:56,070 --> 02:47:58,270
If you've got skin in this game, speak up.

3173
02:47:58,510 --> 02:48:00,890
If you don't, back off.

3174
02:48:00,890 --> 02:48:04,790
We have a responsibility to the people we've rescued, you know?

3175
02:48:05,450 --> 02:48:08,370
If you want to go to war against the whole sphere, be my guest.

3176
02:48:08,930 --> 02:48:10,150
But first, listen up.

3177
02:48:10,490 --> 02:48:11,670
I learned something interesting.

3178
02:48:12,270 --> 02:48:18,390
After the wards started raising hell, Suhean ordered his men to sweep the backup communications center under the ribs.

3179
02:48:18,670 --> 02:48:19,050
Okay.

3180
02:48:19,650 --> 02:48:20,170
Yeah.

3181
02:48:20,590 --> 02:48:21,630
Are there monsters there?

3182
02:48:22,510 --> 02:48:23,030
Worse.

3183
02:48:23,590 --> 02:48:25,670
Evidence of Suhean's illegal activities.

3184
02:48:25,830 --> 02:48:26,550
Illegal activities?

3185
02:48:26,630 --> 02:48:27,270
What was he doing?

3186
02:48:27,270 --> 02:48:29,490
You might be able to find something useful in there.

3187
02:48:29,750 --> 02:48:31,870
Something that'll open a door for us.

3188
02:48:32,310 --> 02:48:32,910
Oh!

3189
02:48:34,590 --> 02:48:36,670
Take a look inside your stash.

3190
02:48:37,610 --> 02:48:39,590
Wait, I can give it to...

3191
02:48:39,590 --> 02:48:40,410
Also to the...

3192
02:48:40,410 --> 02:48:42,870
I can play both sides?!

3193
02:48:42,870 --> 02:48:44,530
Let's fucking go!

3194
02:48:47,230 --> 02:48:51,030
Oh my god, I should drink some vodka real quick, though.

3195
02:48:52,190 --> 02:48:53,570
Oh my god!

3196
02:48:53,570 --> 02:48:53,750
Suhean!

3197
02:48:55,670 --> 02:48:57,790
Oh, it's your birthday?!

3198
02:48:57,790 --> 02:48:59,210
Happy birthday!

3199
02:49:00,610 --> 02:49:02,690
Have a bow on the house.

3200
02:49:04,130 --> 02:49:05,410
Oh my god!

3201
02:49:05,490 --> 02:49:09,030
I can also give the censers to the wardens!

3202
02:49:11,270 --> 02:49:12,190
Ah, shit.

3203
02:49:12,430 --> 02:49:14,550
Can you stop doing that?

3204
02:49:19,250 --> 02:49:20,250
I got it!

3205
02:49:25,570 --> 02:49:26,070
Oh!

3206
02:49:26,830 --> 02:49:27,630
Oh, whoops!

3207
02:49:27,750 --> 02:49:28,710
Okay, I guess not.

3208
02:49:28,910 --> 02:49:29,410
Nevermind.

3209
02:49:30,150 --> 02:49:32,490
Nevermind, I can't play both sides.

3210
02:49:33,150 --> 02:49:34,030
It's already too late.

3211
02:49:37,590 --> 02:49:39,470
Nevermind, I gave it to the other guy.

3212
02:49:40,230 --> 02:49:40,730
Goddammit.

3213
02:49:43,350 --> 02:49:44,130
I thought I could!

3214
02:49:53,930 --> 02:49:55,030
Thank you!

3215
02:49:56,790 --> 02:50:00,610
I love living in in Glasgow, Chernobyl!

3216
02:50:01,390 --> 02:50:03,130
What does a guide do?

3217
02:50:23,770 --> 02:50:25,470
Just kidding, my boy.

3218
02:50:25,750 --> 02:50:26,950
Just kidding!

3219
02:50:29,770 --> 02:50:30,290
Alright.

3220
02:50:30,610 --> 02:50:32,530
Why can't he just come with me?

3221
02:50:32,650 --> 02:50:34,070
And he could guide me to places.

3222
02:50:35,490 --> 02:50:37,950
Like, he's not even doing his job!

3223
02:50:38,290 --> 02:50:38,890
What is he gonna do?

3224
02:50:39,530 --> 02:50:40,050
Fucking...

3225
02:50:40,050 --> 02:50:40,330
Ugh!

3226
02:50:41,870 --> 02:50:42,390
Ugh!

3227
02:50:42,670 --> 02:50:44,050
I wonder if these can cause damage.

3228
02:50:44,230 --> 02:50:47,530
It's like minus one damage every time I chuck it.

3229
02:50:48,610 --> 02:50:50,570
Like, god, I have unlimited bolts.

3230
02:50:52,490 --> 02:50:52,970
Boom!

3231
02:50:58,030 --> 02:50:58,510
Alright.

3232
02:50:58,770 --> 02:50:59,910
What's my current mission?

3233
02:51:04,180 --> 02:51:06,960
Get into the sphere's abandoned hub.

3234
02:51:07,240 --> 02:51:08,740
Alright, we're gonna call it here, actually.

3235
02:51:08,960 --> 02:51:09,260
I...

3236
02:51:10,840 --> 02:51:11,900
We did it!

3237
02:51:12,560 --> 02:51:13,960
We did our job!

3238
02:51:14,820 --> 02:51:16,420
We did... Also, I need to rest my voice.

3239
02:51:16,480 --> 02:51:17,360
I don't wanna fuck it...

3240
02:51:19,380 --> 02:51:21,340
I don't wanna overdo it today!

3241
02:51:21,580 --> 02:51:21,880
Chat!

3242
02:51:22,080 --> 02:51:23,240
So we're gonna call it here!

3243
02:51:23,240 --> 02:51:26,060
Cause I still wanna chat with you guys!

3244
02:51:27,340 --> 02:51:29,620
I'm, like, trying to make sure I don't overdo it.

3245
02:51:29,780 --> 02:51:30,020
God!

3246
02:51:31,600 --> 02:51:33,600
But it's been so fun so far!

3247
02:51:33,840 --> 02:51:39,940
I think, like, as this being, like, my first Stalker game, I am confused.

3248
02:51:40,580 --> 02:51:50,280
I am, like, confused in some areas, because, like, I don't know if I should have played this as, like, my first game.

3249
02:51:50,280 --> 02:51:50,580
Like...

3250
02:51:55,060 --> 02:52:01,160
I think, like, it does help that you guys are, like, telling me about the lore of it.

3251
02:52:01,440 --> 02:52:06,080
So, like, so, I'm, like, learning it as we go along.

3252
02:52:06,200 --> 02:52:13,880
Learning bits about the Stalker universe as we play it, because you guys are, like, helping me with that.

3253
02:52:14,460 --> 02:52:18,160
So it is, like, I am, like, understanding a little bit more.

3254
02:52:18,160 --> 02:52:37,040
I just think it's very funny that I just think it's very funny that it's based on in, like, you know, in Ukraine, but, like, like, you know, you would think it would be, like, Metro voice acting, where they'll obviously talk in, like, an accent that matches the environment,

3255
02:52:37,540 --> 02:52:39,480
but then but...

3256
02:52:40,480 --> 02:52:49,700
I love how I love how, like, but instead instead of UK for Ukraine, it's UK for the United Kingdom.

3257
02:52:49,860 --> 02:52:53,580
Because everybody's speaking in a British accent.

3258
02:52:55,540 --> 02:52:56,840
AHAHAHAHAHAHAHA Yeah!

3259
02:52:57,440 --> 02:53:00,600
It's, like, I I don't know why.

3260
02:53:01,240 --> 02:53:05,920
Why is everybody speaking Why is, like, why is this guy Scottish?

3261
02:53:07,920 --> 02:53:15,060
Um, um, Stalker throws you into deep end no matter which game, but it's probably the least buggy out of all them unless you want to get into mods.

3262
02:53:15,300 --> 02:53:16,540
Thank you for the super chat!

3263
02:53:16,680 --> 02:53:17,280
Thank you, thank you!

3264
02:53:17,400 --> 02:53:39,200
I'm happy that, like, um, we didn't encounter any, like, issues in general, um, because, uh, uh, there wasn't anything uh, uh, regarding, like, bugs that people said they encountered during launch, uh, so it was, like, nice that it was very smooth.

3265
02:53:39,320 --> 02:53:44,520
Yeah, it was very smooth because, like, originally people were, like, talking about performance issues, and I wasn't even lagging, too.

3266
02:53:44,920 --> 02:53:48,180
Like, I, myself wasn't even lagging while playing it, so that was really good.

3267
02:53:48,880 --> 02:53:51,740
Um, Devlin, thank you for the super chat!

3268
02:53:51,840 --> 02:53:52,460
Thank you, thank you!

3269
02:53:52,480 --> 02:53:53,680
Thanks for the stream, Doki!

3270
02:53:54,220 --> 02:53:59,300
Uh, missed the beginning because of my family having to, having a birthday dinner for me, but at least I'm here for the end!

3271
02:53:59,360 --> 02:54:00,500
Thank you for the super chat, Devlin!

3272
02:54:00,600 --> 02:54:01,540
Thank you, thank you!

3273
02:54:02,820 --> 02:54:04,280
Happy birthday to you!

3274
02:54:04,680 --> 02:54:05,980
Happy birthday to you!

3275
02:54:06,200 --> 02:54:07,760
Happy birthday, dear Devlin!

3276
02:54:08,060 --> 02:54:09,300
Happy birthday to you!

3277
02:54:09,300 --> 02:54:10,100
Nyah!

3278
02:54:10,720 --> 02:54:11,240
Happy birthday!

3279
02:54:12,340 --> 02:54:14,720
Uh, it's so many people's birthdays today!

3280
02:54:14,900 --> 02:54:16,480
I know I missed a birthday earlier.

3281
02:54:16,720 --> 02:54:18,700
Let me see if I can find it.

3282
02:54:19,780 --> 02:54:22,660
Guys, does anyone remember whose birthday it was?

3283
02:54:23,020 --> 02:54:23,500
Guys?

3284
02:54:25,460 --> 02:54:25,980
Uh...

3285
02:54:25,980 --> 02:54:26,640
I'm looking.

3286
02:54:27,220 --> 02:54:29,000
Guys, which one, who was it?

3287
02:54:29,060 --> 02:54:30,900
I missed the birthday soupa earlier.

02:54:31,540 --> 02:54:32,540
Um, does anyone remember?

3289
02:54:32,900 --> 02:54:33,660

02:54:43,080 --> 02:54:47,540
Um, soccer is my favorite game to see, so it's been really fun getting to see you experience it for the first time.

3294
02:54:47,820 --> 02:54:50,800

It's, it's like fun to experience it blind.

3299
02:54:59,220 --> 02:55:04,480
And it definitely made me interested in checking out, um, the first soccer game.

3300
02:55:04,780 --> 02:55:10,320
Um, just because like, you know, like, there's like so much, like, history about, around the game.

3301
02:55:10,420 --> 02:55:13,540
So I'm like, oh my god, what was it like, what's the lore behind this?

3302
02:55:13,620 --> 02:55:15,640
Like, everything and stuff like that.

3303
02:55:15,680 --> 02:55:18,480
So, it's definitely very interesting.

3304
02:55:19,240 --> 02:55:21,640
Alright, I'm trying to see, uh...

3305
02:55:22,220 --> 02:55:24,260
I'm trying to see whose other birthday I missed.

3306
02:55:24,280 --> 02:55:26,700
I'm sorry if I missed your birthday soupa!

3307
02:55:26,820 --> 02:55:28,940

02:55:36,380 --> 02:55:36,820

Yeah!

3318
02:55:46,900 --> 02:55:48,500
I'm sad I didn't hear it.

3319
02:55:48,960 --> 02:55:49,720
Cheeky, breeky.

3320
02:55:49,920 --> 02:55:52,180
Where, where would they, where would they say that?

3321
02:55:52,940 --> 02:55:56,560
Yeah, I saw people, like, like, talking about it in chat.

3322
02:55:56,980 --> 02:56:00,520
But I don't know, like, where, in what case, like, we'd get that interaction.

3323
02:56:02,180 --> 02:56:02,680
Um...

3324
02:56:04,780 --> 02:56:05,280
Uh...

3325
02:56:05,280 --> 02:56:09,260
Yeah, it's actually, uh, it's very interesting so far.

02:56:09,860 --> 02:56:11,660
Um, I'm, okay, let me see.

3327
02:56:12,200 --> 02:56:13,300
In the first stalker?

3328
02:56:13,400 --> 02:56:14,980
Oh, no, oh, it's in the bandits?

3329
02:56:15,200 --> 02:56:15,820
Okay, let me see.

3330
02:56:16,180 --> 02:56:20,600
How long, guys, I'm gonna, how long to complete stalker 2?

3331
02:56:29,900 --> 02:56:30,900
Okay, um...

3332
02:56:30,900 --> 02:56:31,760
Ahaha!

3333
02:56:36,320 --> 02:56:37,760
Okay, um...

3334
02:56:41,340 --> 02:56:42,060
Um...

3335
02:56:42,060 --> 02:56:44,900
Stalker 2 dev says, I mean, we saw the map.

3336
02:56:45,380 --> 02:56:45,820
Hahaha!

3337
02:56:46,320 --> 02:56:49,940
We saw the map.

3338
02:56:50,500 --> 02:56:53,240
Stalker 2 dev says, the game is huge.

3339
02:56:53,540 --> 02:57:00,860
It takes 100 hours to fully beat and was built Oh my fucking...

3340
02:57:01,780 --> 02:57:03,320
Oh my god.

3341
02:57:04,900 --> 02:57:06,140
Oh, anyway.

3342
02:57:06,520 --> 02:57:08,080
Speaking of stalker 2.

3343
02:57:08,620 --> 02:57:11,440
I have some free codes for you guys.

3344
02:57:11,900 --> 02:57:12,240
Yeah.

3345
02:57:12,560 --> 02:57:13,560
So you guys stayed up here.

3346
02:57:17,040 --> 02:57:19,860
MSI sponsored today's stream.

3347
02:57:21,560 --> 02:57:26,640
And because of that, is in order to promote their newest promotion regarding the monitors.

3348
02:57:26,640 --> 02:57:33,180

02:57:33,660 --> 02:57:36,320
Plus $30 of Steam Wallet.

3350
02:57:36,540 --> 02:57:40,320
So this is, again, thank you to MSI for sponsoring today's stream.

3351
02:57:40,680 --> 02:57:43,460
I was originally going to play stalker 2 anyway on launch day.

3352
02:57:44,020 --> 02:57:45,680
So, you know, it was a great bonus.

3353
02:57:45,900 --> 02:57:48,560
You know, a little happy bonus that it was sponsored.

3354
02:57:48,980 --> 02:57:52,040
And they provided free game codes for the dragoons.

3355
02:57:52,320 --> 02:57:54,300
So I'm going to grab those real quick.

3356
02:57:54,400 --> 02:57:55,900
Alright guys, I'm going to give you guys a countdown.

3357
02:57:55,900 --> 02:57:58,300
Okay, there's going to be a stream delay actually.

3358
02:57:58,560 --> 02:58:00,020
So I'm going to...

3359
02:58:00,680 --> 02:58:02,760

02:58:02,760 --> 02:58:04,780
Wait, you know what would be so fucked up?

3361
02:58:04,920 --> 02:58:05,600
If I...

3362
02:58:06,900 --> 02:58:07,620
Okay.

3363
02:58:08,060 --> 02:58:08,440
Alright.

3364
02:58:08,980 --> 02:58:11,860
I'm going to see how fast you guys can type.

3365
02:58:12,680 --> 02:58:14,620
For the first one.

3366
02:58:15,260 --> 02:58:15,980
So...

3367
02:58:15,980 --> 02:58:16,440

02:58:21,980 --> 02:58:22,380
Alright.

3374
02:58:22,900 --> 02:58:23,780
The first code.

3375
02:58:23,780 --> 02:58:25,800
I'm going to type it on screen.

3376
02:58:26,000 --> 02:58:28,400
And then we'll see how good you guys are.

3377

Last letter.

3392
02:59:13,770 --> 02:59:14,770
Last...

3393
02:59:14,770 --> 02:59:15,950
Last letter.

3394
02:59:16,150 --> 02:59:17,350
What would it be?

3395
02:59:18,470 --> 02:59:20,570
What would be the last one?

3396
02:59:22,430 --> 02:59:24,370
What's the last letter?

3397
02:59:26,690 --> 02:59:27,490
What?

3398
02:59:28,390 --> 02:59:29,130
W.

3399
02:59:29,530 --> 02:59:30,990
Okay, did anyone get it?

3400
02:59:31,210 --> 02:59:32,010
Who got it?

3401
02:59:32,810 --> 02:59:34,810
That's so evil.

3402
02:59:35,470 --> 02:59:37,110
Guess the last letter.

3403
02:59:40,370 --> 02:59:41,350
Oh my god.

3404
02:59:41,670 --> 02:59:43,290
Guess the last letter.

You monster.

3406
02:59:46,910 --> 02:59:50,030
Oh my god, it was already redeemed?

3407
02:59:50,450 --> 02:59:51,390
Who got it?

3408
02:59:51,810 --> 02:59:53,890
Who got it?

3409
02:59:54,390 --> 02:59:55,510
Alright, next one.

3410
02:59:55,730 --> 02:59:56,890
This is the next one.

3411
02:59:56,970 --> 02:59:58,850
Okay, the next one I'm gonna post it in chat.

3412
02:59:59,610 --> 03:00:01,290
Okay, you don't be really evil.

3413
03:00:03,210 --> 03:00:03,690
Alright.

3414
03:00:05,770 --> 03:00:06,750
Alright, alright.

The next one I'm gonna post it on...

3416
03:00:08,470 --> 03:00:10,770
My internet is nowhere fast enough for this.

3417
03:00:11,170 --> 03:00:11,490
Alright.

3418
03:00:13,350 --> 03:00:13,830

I'm gonna tweet it.

3422
03:00:20,230 --> 03:00:22,930
A person just brute-forced this.

3423
03:00:23,810 --> 03:00:25,570
Just give away all the...

3424
03:00:25,570 --> 03:00:26,830
Oh, that's fucking evil.

3425
03:00:27,030 --> 03:00:29,810
Give away all the codes and I remove the last letter.

3426
03:00:30,290 --> 03:00:30,790
Alright.

3427
03:00:31,530 --> 03:00:32,750
And it's sticking out.

3428
03:00:33,010 --> 03:00:34,230
They had to guess.

3429
03:00:34,510 --> 03:00:35,710
Alright, here we go.

3430
03:00:36,050 --> 03:00:36,930

Oh, Alan got another one.

3442
03:00:57,150 --> 03:00:58,190
Alan got this one.

3443
03:00:58,250 --> 03:00:58,510
Alright.

3444
03:00:59,290 --> 03:00:59,850
Okay.

3445
03:01:00,290 --> 03:01:01,950

Now, what would the last two be?

3452
03:01:23,670 --> 03:01:25,550
Wait, this is the one I just...

3453

Oh, sorry.

3454
03:01:27,070 --> 03:01:28,010
I have to retype this.

3455
03:01:28,090 --> 03:01:29,510
I gave you guys the wrong one.

3456
03:01:30,790 --> 03:01:31,290

03:01:49,470 --> 03:01:50,810
Alright, who redeemed it?

3468
03:01:51,550 --> 03:01:53,370
Oh, I keep forgetting my glasses.

3469
03:01:54,250 --> 03:01:55,730
There's no 6, by the way.

3470
03:01:55,790 --> 03:01:57,650
I just needed to fix myself.

3471
03:01:58,650 --> 03:01:59,610
There's no 5, by the way.

3472
03:01:59,710 --> 03:02:00,930
There's no 7, by the way.

3473
03:02:02,470 --> 03:02:03,050
Guys...

3474
03:02:03,050 --> 03:02:05,350
Oh, Wafflestein got this one.

3475
03:02:07,050 --> 03:02:07,910
How am I evil?

3476
03:02:08,350 --> 03:02:09,990
I'm literally a pussy.

3477
03:02:10,730 --> 03:02:11,310
Alright.

3478
03:02:11,850 --> 03:02:12,610
Last one.

3479
03:02:14,790 --> 03:02:15,790
Last one.

3480
03:02:16,410 --> 03:02:16,930
Guys.

3481
03:02:17,750 --> 03:02:18,830
Last one.

3482
03:02:19,270 --> 03:02:19,610
Alright.

3483
03:02:20,910 --> 03:02:23,170
Alright, I'm posting this one in chat.

3484
03:02:23,790 --> 03:02:24,870
Make the last one.

3485
03:02:24,930 --> 03:02:26,110
What if I reverse it?

3486
03:02:26,430 --> 03:02:28,210
What if I give you, like, every...

3487
03:02:28,210 --> 03:02:29,390
All 5 digits?

3488
03:02:30,090 --> 03:02:31,890
All 5 digits of it?

3489
03:02:31,990 --> 03:02:33,670
But then, like, I put them out of order.

3490
03:02:35,330 --> 03:02:35,850
Like...

3491
03:02:36,950 --> 03:02:38,670
I give you 5...

3492
03:02:38,670 --> 03:02:40,690
I just put them all out of order.

3493
03:02:41,190 --> 03:02:43,750
And then you have to reorder it yourself.

3494
03:02:43,950 --> 03:02:46,390
Dude, that is evil as hell.

3495
03:02:50,050 --> 03:02:52,290
No, please don't.

3496
03:02:52,450 --> 03:02:52,610
No.

3497
03:02:53,730 --> 03:02:54,730
Okay, okay.

3498
03:02:55,610 --> 03:02:56,750
Okay, I won't.

3499
03:02:56,830 --> 03:02:57,610
I won't do that.

3500
03:02:57,870 --> 03:02:58,690
I won't do that.

3501
03:02:58,870 --> 03:02:59,930
I won't.

3502
03:03:01,630 --> 03:03:03,310
Okay, but then it'll give...

3503
03:03:03,310 --> 03:03:06,350
It'll give people with slower internet a chance, though.

3504
03:03:06,890 --> 03:03:07,290
Guys.

3505
03:03:07,750 --> 03:03:10,210
All I'm saying is that...

3506
03:03:10,210 --> 03:03:13,690
It'll give, like, people with slower internet a chance.

3507
03:03:14,130 --> 03:03:16,370
And then they'll, like, they have...

3508
03:03:18,070 --> 03:03:19,030
Okay, so...

3509
03:03:19,030 --> 03:03:20,870
I'm gonna give you 5 of each.

3510
03:03:21,590 --> 03:03:22,850
And then you're gonna have to...

3511
03:03:22,850 --> 03:03:24,490
You're gonna have to guess, like...

3512
03:03:26,690 --> 03:03:27,650
The order.

3513
03:03:28,210 --> 03:03:29,550
The order of this.

3514
03:03:29,910 --> 03:03:31,210
Okay, I'm gonna hide it.

3515
03:03:31,710 --> 03:03:34,610
Alright, and then, like, whoever figured it out...

3516
03:03:34,610 --> 03:03:37,310
Whoever figured it out, congratulations.

3517
03:03:38,390 --> 03:03:40,550
Alright, this is all out of order, by the way.

3518
03:03:41,030 --> 03:03:42,650
All of this is out of order.

3519
03:03:44,210 --> 03:03:47,650
So you guys have to figure out which one it is.

3520
03:03:48,610 --> 03:03:49,130
Alright.

3521
03:03:50,450 --> 03:03:51,590
Alright, you guys ready?

3522
03:03:52,110 --> 03:03:52,570
Alright.

3523
03:03:54,530 --> 03:03:55,050
Alright.

3524
03:03:55,730 --> 03:03:57,890
I'm gonna put, like...

3525
03:03:57,890 --> 03:03:58,610
Alright.

3526
03:03:59,450 --> 03:04:01,050
This is the first one.

3527
03:04:01,590 --> 03:04:02,570
It's all out of order.

3528
03:04:02,730 --> 03:04:03,590
Like, this...

3529
03:04:03,590 --> 03:04:04,970
These are all, like...

3530
03:04:04,970 --> 03:04:06,070
It's, like, 3...

3531
03:04:06,070 --> 03:04:08,910
It's, like, 3 sections of 5 digits.

3532
03:04:09,310 --> 03:04:10,050
And they're all...

3533
03:04:10,050 --> 03:04:10,790
But they're, like...

3534
03:04:10,790 --> 03:04:12,650
The section itself is out of order.

3535
03:04:13,850 --> 03:04:14,370
So...

3536
03:04:14,370 --> 03:04:15,910
So you gotta figure it out.

3537
03:04:18,470 --> 03:04:19,770
No, they're not all.

3538
03:04:20,050 --> 03:04:20,890
It's a section.

3539
03:04:21,970 --> 03:04:22,490
So...

3540
03:04:22,490 --> 03:04:24,930
You gotta figure out which one's first, second, and third.

3541
03:04:25,450 --> 03:04:26,710
You gotta figure it out.

3542
03:04:26,970 --> 03:04:29,410
Yeah, I'm not doing this.

3543
03:04:30,650 --> 03:04:32,230
No, it is possible.

3544
03:04:33,290 --> 03:04:34,330
It's literally...

3545
03:04:34,330 --> 03:04:35,030
It's literally...

3546
03:04:35,030 --> 03:04:39,890
You gotta figure out which is the first section, which is the second, and which is the third.

3547
03:04:39,890 --> 03:04:41,770
And then, it's like a puzzle.

3548
03:04:42,030 --> 03:04:43,130
You guys love puzzles, right?

3549
03:04:45,530 --> 03:04:47,690
You guys love puzzles, right?

3550
03:04:47,830 --> 03:04:48,890
And it's literally...

3551
03:04:48,890 --> 03:04:51,490
That's why you guys love watching me play Silent Hill.

3552
03:04:52,090 --> 03:04:53,950
Oh, it's already activated?

3553
03:04:54,190 --> 03:04:54,770
There's no...

3554
03:04:54,770 --> 03:04:55,210
It's just...

3555
03:04:55,210 --> 03:04:56,430
Yeah, it's 6...

3556
03:04:56,430 --> 03:04:57,930
Who solved it?

3557
03:04:58,370 --> 03:04:59,910
Who the fuck solved it?

3558
03:05:03,930 --> 03:05:05,050
Wait, what was...

3559
03:05:05,050 --> 03:05:06,190
I think I got it?

3560
03:05:06,230 --> 03:05:06,950
Who got it?

3561
03:05:08,110 --> 03:05:09,530
You can't say, I think I got it.

3562
03:05:09,530 --> 03:05:12,290
Like, it tells you if you got it or not.

3563
03:05:13,130 --> 03:05:14,290
Oh my god.

3564
03:05:14,590 --> 03:05:16,690
Oh my god, that was fast.

3565
03:05:17,230 --> 03:05:18,150
You gotta stop.

3566
03:05:18,350 --> 03:05:19,850
It's literally 6 combinations.

3567
03:05:21,070 --> 03:05:22,050
Who was it?

3568
03:05:22,190 --> 03:05:22,930
Who figured...

3569
03:05:22,930 --> 03:05:24,530
Wait, Dresden got it?

3570
03:05:24,590 --> 03:05:25,650
Oh my god.

3571
03:05:26,250 --> 03:05:26,550
Wait.

3572
03:05:27,070 --> 03:05:28,570
Oh my god, that's fast.

3573
03:05:30,310 --> 03:05:31,450
But yeah, that was...

3574
03:05:31,450 --> 03:05:32,990
I don't remember what the combination was.

3575
03:05:33,010 --> 03:05:34,170
This was the correct combination.

3576
03:05:35,450 --> 03:05:36,390
See, look at that.

3577
03:05:36,470 --> 03:05:37,590
Wasn't that fun, guys?

3578
03:05:38,930 --> 03:05:40,390
Guys, wasn't that fun?

3579
03:05:40,590 --> 03:05:42,250
This was the correct answer.

3580
03:05:42,870 --> 03:05:44,410
Wasn't that fun, everybody?

3581
03:05:49,750 --> 03:05:51,170
It's like a little game.

3582
03:05:51,250 --> 03:05:52,450
A little game we have.

3583
03:05:52,810 --> 03:05:53,730
You guys gotta...

3584
03:05:53,730 --> 03:05:56,510
It's like, you know, earning the free code.

3585
03:05:57,850 --> 03:05:58,290
Yeah.

3586
03:05:58,690 --> 03:05:59,770
But congrats, everybody.

3587
03:06:00,030 --> 03:06:02,590
Congratulations to all the dragoons that got the...

3588
03:06:04,750 --> 03:06:05,350
That...

3589
03:06:05,350 --> 03:06:08,630
I typed that but got too many attempts.

3590
03:06:08,930 --> 03:06:09,910
Oh my god.

3591
03:06:10,170 --> 03:06:10,550
Anyway.

3592
03:06:13,050 --> 03:06:13,950
But yeah.

3593
03:06:14,370 --> 03:06:18,870
Thank you again to MSI for sponsoring today's stream.

3594
03:06:19,470 --> 03:06:21,250
And for giving out codes for the dragoons.

3595
03:06:21,550 --> 03:06:23,850
Another thing to show is the, you know...

3596
03:06:23,850 --> 03:06:30,050
For those who don't know, my collection for gamer subs has dropped today.

3597
03:06:30,470 --> 03:06:33,150
I haven't tweeted it out yet because I was like going...

3598
03:06:33,650 --> 03:06:34,070
I was...

3599
03:06:34,070 --> 03:06:36,030
I had so much worse stuff to do.

3600
03:06:36,650 --> 03:06:40,430
The fair and the round chances of the last code was 1 to 2,000 viewers.

3601
03:06:41,030 --> 03:06:42,310
Giga, thank you for the super chat.

3602
03:06:42,390 --> 03:06:43,250
Thank you, thank you.

3603
03:06:43,550 --> 03:06:45,190
Shadows, thank you for the super chat.

3604
03:06:45,270 --> 03:06:46,090
Thank you, thank you.

3605
03:06:46,370 --> 03:06:50,730
I can't believe I fell out the window, got called a nerd, then lost money to Toki.

3606
03:06:51,030 --> 03:06:51,870
Thank you for the super chat.

3607
03:06:51,930 --> 03:06:52,790
Thank you, thank you.

3608
03:06:53,710 --> 03:06:54,110
But...

3609
03:06:55,450 --> 03:06:58,390
We have all our products now out...

3610
03:06:58,390 --> 03:06:59,990
Now out on gamer subs.

3611
03:07:00,550 --> 03:07:02,130
I saw...

3612
03:07:03,110 --> 03:07:07,690
I saw people didn't realize that I have a gamer sub code.

3613
03:07:07,990 --> 03:07:08,910
So it is...

3614
03:07:08,910 --> 03:07:13,630
If you use the code DokiBird or Doki, you get 10% off on your order.

3615
03:07:14,250 --> 03:07:19,490
So yeah, like I said earlier, the more people that order the items in this collection...

3616
03:07:19,490 --> 03:07:21,470
The more likely I can get my own flavor.

3617
03:07:22,370 --> 03:07:24,850
Don't you guys want your own DokiBird drink?

3618
03:07:27,550 --> 03:07:30,370
So it really does help out.

3619
03:07:31,250 --> 03:07:37,870
We have the shaker cup, the t-shirt, and also the stickers.

3620
03:07:38,570 --> 03:07:40,930
The sticker pack contains all the designs.

3621
03:07:41,470 --> 03:07:45,510
The only randomness is whichever design is a holographic.

3622
03:07:47,230 --> 03:07:49,950
All the designs are included.

3623
03:07:49,950 --> 03:07:51,430
So it's not really gotcha.

3624
03:07:51,530 --> 03:07:56,150
The only gotcha part of the sticker pack is whichever one is a holographic.

3625
03:07:56,230 --> 03:07:58,090
So it includes everything.

3626
03:07:58,230 --> 03:07:59,970
It includes all the designs in the sticker pack.

3627
03:08:00,870 --> 03:08:03,770
I was reading the description and even I was confused.

3628
03:08:04,150 --> 03:08:05,950
So I was like, oh shit, like...

3629
03:08:07,330 --> 03:08:11,810
Oh shit, is it the chances of getting the sticker gotcha or something?

3630
03:08:11,870 --> 03:08:12,530
And they were like, oh no.

3631
03:08:12,630 --> 03:08:13,950
And I was like, okay, clarify it.

3632
03:08:14,150 --> 03:08:16,970
So they clarified it in the description.

3633
03:08:16,970 --> 03:08:22,070
So in the description, now it says it includes all five base set designs.

3634
03:08:22,270 --> 03:08:23,330
So all of them.

3635
03:08:23,650 --> 03:08:26,270
So they redid the description because even I was confused.

3636
03:08:26,490 --> 03:08:27,190
I was like, wait a minute.

3637
03:08:27,350 --> 03:08:28,150
I didn't want it gotcha.

3638
03:08:28,390 --> 03:08:33,450
I wanted everybody to put gotcha for it.

3639
03:08:33,690 --> 03:08:36,110
So I'm glad they changed the description.

3640
03:08:36,390 --> 03:08:38,450
But now it's more clear as to what it is.

3641
03:08:38,830 --> 03:08:39,990
Nabi, thank you for the superchat.

3642
03:08:40,070 --> 03:08:40,730
Thank you, thank you.

3643
03:08:40,950 --> 03:08:41,950
Preorder your waifu cup.

3644
03:08:42,030 --> 03:08:42,850
Can't wait for it.

3645
03:08:42,850 --> 03:08:43,630
Yay, thank you.

3646
03:08:43,650 --> 03:08:44,270
Thank you for the superchat.

3647
03:08:44,350 --> 03:08:44,790
Thank you, thank you.

3648
03:08:44,790 --> 03:08:45,470
I'm super excited.

3649
03:08:45,690 --> 03:08:46,550
I'm really excited.

3650
03:08:48,670 --> 03:08:49,830
I'm really excited.

3651
03:08:49,890 --> 03:08:50,650
It's free.

3652
03:08:50,790 --> 03:08:51,730
You can't say that.

3653
03:08:52,070 --> 03:08:54,990
That code, the game code I gave was free.

3654
03:08:55,350 --> 03:08:55,930
This is paid.

3655
03:08:57,950 --> 03:09:01,310
Literally, it's like complaining about free roll and gotcha.

3656
03:09:07,870 --> 03:09:09,470
Heaven, thank you for the superchat.

3657
03:09:09,570 --> 03:09:10,510
Thank you, thank you.

3658
03:09:10,690 --> 03:09:12,830
Fun way to spend my birthday evening.

3659
03:09:13,030 --> 03:09:14,010
Thank you for the stream, Doki.

3660
03:09:14,010 --> 03:09:14,570
P.S.

3661
03:09:14,570 --> 03:09:16,450
It was also PhantomDragon's birthday.

3662
03:09:16,710 --> 03:09:17,350
Oh my god, okay.

3663
03:09:17,450 --> 03:09:18,710
Happy birthday to you.

3664
03:09:18,890 --> 03:09:19,930
Happy birthday to you.

3665
03:09:19,930 --> 03:09:20,830
Thank you for the superchat.

3666
03:09:20,950 --> 03:09:22,270
Happy birthday, dear Phantom.

3667
03:09:22,690 --> 03:09:24,210
Happy birthday to you.

3668
03:09:24,390 --> 03:09:26,210
Yeah, happy birthday, Phantom.

3669
03:09:27,210 --> 03:09:28,830
There's so many people's birthdays.

3670
03:09:29,750 --> 03:09:33,330
But yeah, it's been a wild ride.

3671
03:09:33,650 --> 03:09:36,670
My voice is dead because I am still recovering.

3672
03:09:36,830 --> 03:09:38,550
Oh my god, did you guys see that?

3673
03:09:40,330 --> 03:09:44,270
Did you guys see the fucking gamer recap?

3674
03:09:44,390 --> 03:09:45,890
YouTube gamer recap thing?

3675
03:09:46,230 --> 03:09:47,570
I thought that was AI.

3676
03:09:48,290 --> 03:09:51,210
Like the Doki Bird's return.

3677
03:09:51,650 --> 03:09:55,410
I didn't realize they actually made a section for me there.

3678
03:09:55,570 --> 03:09:57,810
I thought it was AI.

3679
03:09:58,210 --> 03:10:04,630
I legitimately did not think it was like a thing they made themselves to promote me.

3680
03:10:04,710 --> 03:10:06,650
I was so fucking surprised.

3681
03:10:06,650 --> 03:10:08,730
Because I was just thinking like...

3682
03:10:09,310 --> 03:10:11,010
Yeah, I didn't realize!

3683
03:10:11,250 --> 03:10:12,230
I was so...

3684
03:10:12,230 --> 03:10:15,790
I was actually like really shocked.

3685
03:10:16,630 --> 03:10:19,530
Because when I first saw people tweeting about it...

3686
03:10:19,530 --> 03:10:20,890
I was like, oh that's cool.

3687
03:10:21,130 --> 03:10:23,070
You know like the summary AI thing?

3688
03:10:23,330 --> 03:10:24,610
I thought it was literally that.

3689
03:10:24,730 --> 03:10:26,770
I thought it was like the summary AI where...

3690
03:10:27,870 --> 03:10:30,650
Also, here's my thing for those who want to...

3691
03:10:30,650 --> 03:10:32,350
Here's the collection, guys.

3692
03:10:32,350 --> 03:10:34,350
So like I thought that...

3693
03:10:34,930 --> 03:10:38,070
The Dragoons were there to watch Doki Bird's return.

3694
03:10:38,310 --> 03:10:40,690
Was like some summary AI thing that they made.

3695
03:10:40,910 --> 03:10:46,810
But I didn't realize that YouTube actually personally wrote that section about it.

3696
03:10:46,890 --> 03:10:48,290
So I was like, holy fuck.

3697
03:10:48,490 --> 03:10:50,030
Like I...

3698
03:10:51,050 --> 03:10:52,570
YouTube noticed me.

3699
03:10:56,260 --> 03:10:57,840
But that was so cool.

3700
03:10:58,000 --> 03:10:59,260
That was really, really cool.

3701
03:11:01,500 --> 03:11:01,940
Um...

3702
03:11:01,940 --> 03:11:03,220
Slug, thank you for the super chat.

3703
03:11:03,280 --> 03:11:04,600
Thank you for every super chat.

3704
03:11:04,660 --> 03:11:05,660
Thank you, thank you.

3705
03:11:06,720 --> 03:11:08,080
Thank you for the stream today.

3706
03:11:08,160 --> 03:11:11,000
As a long time fan of the soccer game, seeing your first reaction today...

3707
03:11:11,000 --> 03:11:12,520
We're almost as good as...

3708
03:11:12,520 --> 03:11:14,620
Thank you for the super chat.

3709
03:11:14,720 --> 03:11:15,540
Thank you, thank you.

3710
03:11:15,760 --> 03:11:17,360
Okay, I think like...

3711
03:11:19,400 --> 03:11:21,180
Is everything just an anomaly?

3712
03:11:22,420 --> 03:11:22,860
Like...

3713
03:11:22,860 --> 03:11:24,620
Just like, are you an anomaly?

3714
03:11:25,000 --> 03:11:26,180
Am I an anomaly?

3715
03:11:26,180 --> 03:11:28,640
What is an anomaly here?

3716
03:11:30,080 --> 03:11:32,280
Everything is a fucking anomaly.

3717
03:11:34,580 --> 03:11:35,200
Like...

3718
03:11:38,980 --> 03:11:39,600
Anyway...

3719
03:11:41,560 --> 03:11:43,880
Are we the anomalies?

3720
03:11:45,380 --> 03:11:46,000
Anyway...

3721
03:11:46,000 --> 03:11:48,220
But yes, there's so much stuff...

3722
03:11:48,220 --> 03:11:49,220
To show today.

3723
03:11:49,420 --> 03:11:51,580
So much stuff to show at the moment.

3724
03:11:52,020 --> 03:11:53,100
So it's just like...

3725
03:11:53,100 --> 03:11:54,920
Oh my god, I'm just like...

3726
03:11:54,920 --> 03:11:56,760
Not overwhelmed...

3727
03:11:56,760 --> 03:11:58,040
But I'm like really busy.

3728
03:11:58,860 --> 03:12:00,520
And like...

3729
03:12:00,520 --> 03:12:03,200
There's so much work to catch up on too.

3730
03:12:03,600 --> 03:12:03,940
So...

3731
03:12:03,940 --> 03:12:06,600
I wish I could hang out longer.

3732
03:12:06,780 --> 03:12:08,840
But I have to recover my voice.

3733
03:12:08,960 --> 03:12:09,680
Because like...

3734
03:12:09,680 --> 03:12:11,300
I have to record stuff.

3735
03:12:11,680 --> 03:12:13,860
And I can't record anything.

3736
03:12:13,960 --> 03:12:15,880
Because my voice is dying.

3737
03:12:16,140 --> 03:12:17,520
I felt so bad.

3738
03:12:20,640 --> 03:12:21,240
Um...

3739
03:12:21,240 --> 03:12:22,060
Anyway...

3740
03:12:22,060 --> 03:12:24,100
I don't know if tomorrow there's going to be a stream.

3741
03:12:24,320 --> 03:12:26,240
I might put a schedule up for the last...

3742
03:12:26,240 --> 03:12:27,680
Two days.

3743
03:12:28,000 --> 03:12:30,420
Because Friday would be a collab with...

3744
03:12:30,420 --> 03:12:32,500
Doobie and Filian.

3745
03:12:32,940 --> 03:12:35,520
And then Saturday would be the announcement for the custom.

3746
03:12:36,140 --> 03:12:36,580
Um...

3747
03:12:36,580 --> 03:12:38,220
So yeah, we'll see how it goes.

3748
03:12:38,760 --> 03:12:40,300
I might put a schedule up today.

3749
03:12:40,520 --> 03:12:42,480
I think I might take tomorrow off.

3750
03:12:42,540 --> 03:12:44,320
Just to heal my throat a little bit more.

3751
03:12:44,640 --> 03:12:46,020
Anyway guys, as always...

3752
03:12:46,020 --> 03:12:47,300
I really missed you guys.

3753
03:12:47,300 --> 03:12:48,120
I missed streaming.

3754
03:12:48,380 --> 03:12:50,800
I wish I wasn't sick so I could keep streaming.

3755
03:12:51,000 --> 03:12:52,020
I really... I hate...

3756
03:12:52,020 --> 03:12:53,520
I hate taking breaks.

3757
03:12:53,560 --> 03:12:54,900
I just want to stream.

3758
03:12:55,740 --> 03:12:58,100
But as always everybody, stay hydrated.

3759
03:12:58,320 --> 03:12:58,840
Posture check.

3760
03:12:59,140 --> 03:13:00,740
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

3761
03:13:00,880 --> 03:13:02,760
And if you stayed up for me, head to bed.

3762
03:13:02,820 --> 03:13:04,080
Because you deserve it.

3763
03:13:04,160 --> 03:13:05,340
I'll see you guys next time everybody.

3764
03:13:05,860 --> 03:13:06,500
Bye guys.

3765
03:13:06,800 --> 03:13:07,200
Bye.
