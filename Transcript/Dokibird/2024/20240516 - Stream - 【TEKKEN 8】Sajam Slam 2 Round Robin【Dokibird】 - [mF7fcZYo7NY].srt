1
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:43,780
Oh, let's go baby.

2
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:45,940
Um, everybody's tree.

3
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:47,660
Do you want to call MYK daddy?

4
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:50,000
Why?

5
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:52,560
Don't talk about my coach that way.

6
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:53,660
Hey, dude.

7
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:54,800
I visualize the coach.

8
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:56,820
Okay.

9
00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:00,420
And who had the soundboard in their audio?

10
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:01,160
Who did that?

11
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,400
Who had the soundboard?

12
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:06,860
Why did the games who started that too?

13
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,420
Why is Evolve the game?

14
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:09,840
Uh, so yes, you'll be playing.

15
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:15,940
against everybody the round robin today is worth three
points per match so if your team like wins three two let's

16
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:23,420
say you'll have one the round robin nine to six if your team
somehow wins every match you can win 15-0 uh the round robin

17
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:31,100
on friday is worth five points per match so it's worth
almost double meaning if you do well today it's really good

18
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:36,920
because you can secure a lead for friday friday is worth so
much so really it's about how much you can improve from

19
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:42,460
today to friday and take that improvement all the way to
sunday and then try to win in the bracket on there on sunday

20
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:48,500
the rule will be the first team to three wins wins instead
of the normal points so it'll have the traditional format we

21
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:53,720
did last time but for the round robin we wanted everybody to
play because last time scar's team died and he played twice

22
00:04:53,720 --> 00:05:01,240
out of five matches as an example uh so that was not fun so
we figured it's more fun if everybody gets to play every not

23
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:10,380
this time baby okay i'm Are we allowed to stream before you
take it?

24
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,600
I'm not playing right because I'm scared.

25
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:14,060
I'm so scared.

26
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:15,960
I can't focus.

27
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:17,580
There's so many voices.

28
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:22,520
There's so many voices in my head.

29
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,500
There's so many voices in my head.

30
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:29,380
There's so many voices in my head.

31
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:32,140
They're a bit loud.

32
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,240
Okay, I'll turn them down.

33
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:34,680
I don't know what sound guy is.

34
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:36,160
Sound guy, are you here?

35
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:36,940
Yeah.

36
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:41,300
you'll have you'll have downtime between matches because
like when you're not playing there's too many voices in my

37
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:49,980
head yeah okay i brought that at discord value you know you
have some time there everybody be playing at the same time

38
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:55,960
one thing that's important is that i can't i can't just
ignore them the same thing to make a lobby the exceptions

39
00:05:55,960 --> 00:06:03,560
are people who are not playing on pc those those are the
people who like okay turn them down sorry guys i we go

40
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:11,160
straight into rules individually on but if you are not
playing on pc just let our tos know and then we can get that

41
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:16,420
figured out and you can get added by your your coach if
you're a coach i'm gonna stream real quick and show you how

42
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:22,320
to make the lobby in a really easy way so and if anybody
else wants to watch it'll probably make it easy for you um

43
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:29,160
so good yeah there's a really simple way to do it that's
that's really nice so let me uh share my screen real quick

44
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:33,900
in the copy paste thing guys this might be the old

45
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:39,400
Guys, I did unpack the PC.

46
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:43,180
I just didn't plug it in.

47
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:49,360
It's so good.

48
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:52,460
So the way this...

49
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:54,320
Oh, I missed it.

50
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,240
You haven't done this before.

51
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,640
It's when you go to player match and create the room.

52
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:02,440
Create the room and then one thing I would advise is putting
on a code in order to advance setting.

53
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:03,980
I think a code is fine.

54
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:06,220
Oh, God, please have mercy.

55
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:13,920
your private slots uh i would also recommend adding
simultaneous uh this is so that if your team wants to

56
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:19,980
practice while you play you can practice and then you click
create session oh my god he ducks he plays against kings

57
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:27,780
important thing the main match and whoever is playing next
should always be in group a please do not be like oh my

58
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:33,040
teammate just started his match i'm gonna go play on group b
or like one of these other places and then hold up the event

59
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:39,060
i will make fun of you a lot everybody will make fun of you
please don't hold up If you're going to play next.

60
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,880
Speaking of which, can I actually go?

61
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,940
Yeah, go for it.

62
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,740
Can you please, on record, state that I'm not over?

63
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:47,880
No!

64
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,000
No!

65
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,280
No!

66
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,440
You can either confirm or deny.

67
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,820
That's right, you can't do that!

68
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:55,900
Uh-huh.

69
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:56,980

Did everybody leave yet?

97
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:29,400
I can't tell I'm too busy in a game.

98
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:31,060
I'm so sad.

99
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:33,700
I'm like, what's going on?

100
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:36,720
I should have signed up for the first one.

101
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:38,420
Okay, look, he's just better.

102
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:40,820
I'm sorry.

103
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,940
Don't watch my videos then, because this chemistry will
definitely...

104
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:48,300
Because I've not processed anything in this orientation.

105
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,760
Get ready for the next battle.

106
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,880
Signifier, can you meet me?

107
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,400
Is everybody still in the VC?

108
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,120
Oh shit, everybody left!

109
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:58,920
That's a lot.

110
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,740
Should I lose real quick?

111
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,860
They're going to be scared for sure.

112
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,640
Okay, I'm going to lose it quick.

113
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,500
No, no, no, no, because they're going to play me
differently.

114
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,400
No, no, no, you want to keep the 13 win streak, dude?

115
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,320
No, I don't because they're going to play me differently.

116
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:14,620
They're like, oh, my God, I'm going to play scared, and I'm
not going to predict it.

117
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,460
I would rather they play me no knowledge whatsoever.

118
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,140
Come on, man.

119
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:22,720
I think that's just putting it all out on the table, you
know?

120
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:24,420
We'll see.

121
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:25,780
It worked for me last time.

122
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:27,440
I had a 20 win streak last slam.

123
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,680
I decided to throw it, so it didn't say that I had it.

124
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:34,180
Someone in the chat saying they don't save from quick match.

125
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:34,760
I don't know.

126
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:36,020
I don't know anything about it, though.

127
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:38,320
Oh shit.

128
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,200
Well, whatever.

129
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,460
I don't know anything about it.

130
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:50,220
I don't know about it So they want all the coaches to make a
lobby Yeah, you make a lobby and then I guess just post it

149
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:31,320

like even the lower ranks is like, I don't know.

150
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,080
People are taking this stuff seriously.

151
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:40,300
You're going to learn the King has a 70% chain throw that
probably, we'll teach you that for the second and third one,

152
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:42,540
that they probably won't know how to break.

153
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,340
Like in game, we should teach them that.

154
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,220
Get ready for the next battle.

155
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:48,960

00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,620
That's true, they don't know.

171
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:07,040
Oh, players welcome.

172
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,100

I did it wrong, guys.

177
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:14,580
I made it wrong.

178
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:18,800
That's because you're 40 years old, man.

179
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:21,620
You're older than I am, dude.

180
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:22,620
Not in spirit.

181
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,660
I like what you said, what'd you say the other day?

182
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,280
It's like my nephew who is older than me.

183
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:30,000
Hold on.

184
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:32,840
I'm telling them I'm telling them I didn't make categories.

185
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,860
Is that okay or?

186
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,760
All right, I can remake it, dude.

187
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:39,660
I can remake it.

188
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,570
Wow, now my chat's making fun of me.

189
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:56,710
Oh my god, it's gonna be a horrible day.

190
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:08,090
The average age of this Tekken team is 46.

191
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:09,650
I think- What?

192
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:10,850
They're starving?

193
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:11,550
What?

194
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:13,090
Koki, how old are you?

195
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:13,910
What the fuck?

196
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:16,350
VTubers are young forever.

197
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:18,470
So like maybe like five?

198
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:19,510
Okay.

199
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:21,170
Then that's where.

200
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:23,610
I think three of us are older.

201
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:24,730
So I'll bring down the average.

202
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:25,410
Don't worry.

203
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:26,450
God bless.

204
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:27,570
Thank you.

205
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:28,170
That's it.

206
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:29,270
Yeah.

207
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:30,330
Together assembled.

208
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:32,670
We are a young spry 22 year old.

209
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:33,570
Oh my gosh.

210
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:34,630
We can go to bars.

211
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:35,550
Dude.

212
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:35,930
Yeah.

213
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:37,470
For the first time.

214
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:38,850
Oh my god.

215
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:39,310
Oh my god.

216
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:40,850
We won't get carted.

217
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:42,210
It's awful for us, yeah.

218
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:48,290
Wow, they're getting right into this, huh?

219
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:50,750
Yeah, we just close to go, I guess.

220
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:53,070
Wait, you guys are in the lobby now?

221
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:54,130
Wait, I'm not in there.

222
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:56,070
Wait, I'm fucking in a quick thing.

223
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:57,270
Don't worry, I'll die soon.

224
00:16:57,570 --> 00:16:58,510
I'm going to get destroyed.

225
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:00,210
My lobbies are just broken.

226
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:01,250
I don't know.

227
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:02,530
It's just not.

228
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:04,130
It's just not.

229
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:06,930
Okay, someone else needs to make it.

230
00:17:07,330 --> 00:17:09,010
Maybe we'll let M1K do it.

231

most next level shit ever.

I won't be surprised if I do worse.

321
00:26:22,090 --> 00:26:24,010
Because I have to actually think.

322
00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:27,250
I don't see that happening.

323
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:28,670
It's like warming up before working out.

324
00:26:28,930 --> 00:26:29,530
That's true, that's true.

325
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:31,870
It was just a warm up and now we're gonna hit PR.

326
00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:33,590
Round one.

327
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:38,110
That king is so cute.

328
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:41,110
What the fuck is that?

329
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:48,230
What the fuck is she doing with that little...

330
00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:49,430
Getting very dizzy.

331
00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:50,130
Oh shit.

332
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:52,210
Yup, that's a duck.

333
00:26:52,990 --> 00:26:56,010
Oh no, she ducks!

334
00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:03,670
I can't believe it, it's like she knows she's playing
against the king.

335
00:27:04,850 --> 00:27:07,630
round two you got to throw your best mids

336
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:29,020
oh my god she's so fast i think the armor runs out oh my god
she ducks everything her ass is holding down oh that's fine

337
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:38,480
though hey that's right that's right brawl pro is gonna
teach you so many good mids.

338
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:39,640
Yeah, for tomorrow.

339
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:41,140
Yeah, watch this.

340
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:46,400
This is all, we're just throwing because we all know this
one doesn't matter.

341
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:47,180
That's true.

342
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:47,720
That's true.

343
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,100
That's true.

344
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:51,280
It's too early for this for me.

345
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:56,580
Wait, my hands are definitely not warmed up.

346
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:58,080
It's too early.

347
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,160
That was counter hit.

348
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,180
Oh my god.

349
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:01,580
What?

350
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,900
Oh no, not the spin!

351
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:06,200
Not the spin!

352
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:06,640
Oh no!

353
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:14,180
It's not really fair though, she did have a sword, you know
what I'm saying?

354
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,420
That's true, that's true.

355
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:17,560
Why would you bring a sword to a fucking fistfight?

356
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:18,180
Or a baguette?

357
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:19,980
That's not fair.

358
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,020
That's true.

359
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,180
Is it all best of five?

360
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:24,660
Is it?

361
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,880
I think it's first of two, like last time.

362
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:30,140
It's just a round robin, so she didn't be too long.

363
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:31,300
Right, right.

364
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:35,200
You said pick the wrong character, I just saw that.

365
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:35,740
Yeah.

366
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:48,240

Same rank.

God, but you just have so many years, Kony.

372
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:12,400
That's the thing.

373
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,780
He has more years than me.

374
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:15,680
You gotta understand.

375
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,760
As old as I am, it's James Chen, bro.

376
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:20,680
Wait, this is, you're playing James Chen?

377
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:23,280
He has more years than I could dream of.

378
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:24,860
You're playing Suck my nuts, assholes, James Chen?

379
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:27,680

Oh my God.

381

The James Chen.

382

Not me neither, bro.

383
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:35,860

Mmm, okay.

That's a nice round start.

400
00:31:31,030 --> 00:31:31,970
It's a good gimmick.

401
00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:34,450

Alright, I got it, I got it, I got it.

00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:23,350
He's always out.

410
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:24,350
You know that shit?

411
00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:26,190
Whoa!

412
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:30,750
After the knee, Tony, he's always like crouch jabbing every
time.

413
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:31,210
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

414
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:32,290
He's scared of that graduate.

415
00:32:32,670 --> 00:32:33,590
Boom, hop kick.

416
00:32:34,050 --> 00:32:34,630
You're right, yeah.

00:32:35,210 --> 00:32:36,810
Yeah, knee hop kick for a free combo.

418
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:38,230
Round one.

419
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:43,470
That was supposed to be what he did, but I did the shoulder
because I didn't get the neutral.

420
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:48,310
Oh no.

421
00:32:48,670 --> 00:32:49,310
Oh, I was...

422
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:52,270
That was so much damage.

423
00:32:56,290 --> 00:32:56,610
Okay.

424
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:02,240

Round two.

429
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:09,820
Double low, that's crazy.

430
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,500
Oh, we gotta be a little faster, just a little bit.

431
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:17,180
Yeah, just pretend that's my king in three seconds.

432
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:24,740

block the next one which means grab oh my god he didn't okay

launcher I'm gonna steal that that shit was that's a really

439
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:26,280
really unsafe though you can hot kick it if you block it if
I pop that run one round at a six or nine I'm cool with it

440
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:28,940
you know what I mean like I'm like I do that on ranked every
single day of my life.

441
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:30,320
One half this hammer per rank.

442
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:33,240
Round start.

443
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:33,760
It's really strong.

444
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:35,400
I mean, it's going to crush any highs and shit, you know.

445
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:38,180
Yeah, and they won't expect it.

446
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:39,860
Because you didn't pull it out before.

447
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:41,040
Exactly.

448
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:42,240
Just for the one time.

449
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:43,380
Whoops.

450
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:50,260
Who's next?

451
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:54,540
It should be slime versus coefficient, I think.

452
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:55,420
Good is slime.

453
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:56,200
All right.

454
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:57,060
It's my turn, right?

455
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:59,820
James Chen has some words for you.

456
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:01,740
Did he just tweet this?

457
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,280
Suck my nuts at dude.

458
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:03,880
What the fuck?

459
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:08,220
What the fuck is his problem, man?

460
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:09,700
That's my goat.

461
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:12,320
Why did he say assholes?

462
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:13,800
I was the one that beat- what?

463
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:20,280
Can I get a link to that somewhere?

464
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:21,400
Do you not know the tweet?

465
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:28,660
If you look, if you search James Chen Suck my nuts assholes,
and go through the timeline of what- Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

466

467
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:33,720
I feel like if you just search James Chen tweet, it'll come
up.

468
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,040
Like, that's his legacy.

469
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:35,700
You know what I mean?

470
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:38,400
Am I ready to start?

471
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:43,240

00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:50,660
Destroy here.

499
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:03,420
Damn.

500
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:05,360
Patient.

501
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:06,840
Nice.

502
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,660
A lot of blockage.

503
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:15,370
Yeah, that's a double.

504
00:37:16,650 --> 00:37:16,930
Nice.

505
00:37:19,810 --> 00:37:22,510
I did not prepare this matchup, I'll say it.

506
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:27,270
Round two.

507
00:37:27,690 --> 00:37:29,430
Okay, we're just not showing them the stracks.

508
00:37:30,530 --> 00:37:31,070
Exactly.

509
00:37:32,530 --> 00:37:35,350
It's just round Robin one, we still have round Robin two.

510
00:37:40,090 --> 00:37:40,770
Nice!

511
00:37:41,790 --> 00:37:42,470
Oh!

512
00:37:43,270 --> 00:37:43,950
It's not guaranteed.

513
00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:47,890
Hellsweep's a little risky, but gets it done.

514
00:37:48,030 --> 00:37:49,110
I thought the butt was guaranteed.

515
00:37:49,970 --> 00:37:50,110
No.

516
00:37:50,650 --> 00:37:51,950
Not after the...

517
00:37:51,950 --> 00:37:53,410
It needs to be a higher wall splash.

518
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:54,850
Break the guitar.

519
00:37:55,250 --> 00:37:57,890
I'm sad that her guitar is covering her ass.

520
00:37:59,270 --> 00:37:59,950
I...

521
00:37:59,950 --> 00:38:00,390
You're crazy?

522
00:38:01,270 --> 00:38:03,710
The sad day.

523
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:07,210
At least fully commit.

524
00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:11,750
Good shit.

525
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:15,070
What a hop kick, dude.

526
00:38:15,310 --> 00:38:16,170
He's simply better.

527
00:38:17,890 --> 00:38:18,570
Rage right here.

528
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:19,410
Mish, get the chip.

529
00:38:20,730 --> 00:38:20,930
Oh!

530
00:38:22,070 --> 00:38:22,090
Oh!

531
00:38:22,770 --> 00:38:23,250
Nah!

532
00:38:23,650 --> 00:38:24,110
Haha!

533
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:31,380
Yes!

534
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:31,920
Good shit!

535
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:33,300
Oh god.

536
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:34,800
Not a rage arc, not a rage arc.

537
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,040
At least not immediately.

538
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:37,820
Woo!

539
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:42,680

Good shit.

545
00:39:22,210 --> 00:39:23,590
Here, I gotta restart my game.

546
00:39:23,790 --> 00:39:24,350
She might adapt.

547
00:39:26,010 --> 00:39:26,890
Round one.

548
00:39:27,810 --> 00:39:30,190
Oh, I gotta go to get a for a coach interview.

549
00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:32,710
Oh, a coach interview you.

550

Come on.

551
00:39:33,850 --> 00:39:33,970
Yeah.

552
00:39:34,550 --> 00:39:35,350
All right, I'll be back.

553
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:40,580
Good shit.

554
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:41,540
Attacking that.

555
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:44,100
We have damage.

556
00:39:58,170 --> 00:39:59,750
I always grab it with the health sweep.

557
00:39:59,850 --> 00:40:00,250
It's a little pretty.

558
00:40:00,270 --> 00:40:02,650
She didn't let go on that.

559
00:40:02,730 --> 00:40:03,170
Nice.

560
00:40:04,690 --> 00:40:05,610
Don't worry about it.

561
00:40:05,650 --> 00:40:06,550
Don't overthink it.

562
00:40:07,010 --> 00:40:10,490
Because like, I don't know if they're at that level yet.

563
00:40:10,890 --> 00:40:12,170
She is starting to break grabs though.

564
00:40:12,630 --> 00:40:17,250
Good shit.

565
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:21,760
Nice.

566
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:24,340
I like the idea.

567
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:25,240
Oh, that's true.

568
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:25,580
Jeez.

569
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:26,780
Alright, I'm gonna do five.

570
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:28,680
Oh, Power Crush does beat that.

571
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:29,620
She's correct there.

572
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:30,760
Nice.

573
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:33,260
Copy pressing.

574
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:34,640
Appreciate it.

575
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:35,660
That's a punish.

576
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:37,360
Did you get a control?

577
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:38,180
Did you get this?

578
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:39,340
There we go.

579
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:41,020
Good shit!

580
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:41,560
Yeah!

581
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:42,940
Big, big, big.

582
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:43,900
Just purely big.

583
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:44,480
That's all it is.

584
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:46,000
You're reading his mind!

585
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:47,920
Shit.

586
00:40:51,010 --> 00:40:51,990
I like the idea.

587
00:40:53,330 --> 00:40:55,570
She's giving you all the space in the world, dude.

588
00:40:57,010 --> 00:40:57,430
Good break.

589
00:40:58,890 --> 00:41:00,190
I just keep power crushing.

590
00:41:00,990 --> 00:41:02,090
It's gonna work sometimes.

591
00:41:03,350 --> 00:41:04,710
Yeah, the damage is worth it.

592
00:41:07,930 --> 00:41:08,810
Good shit.

593
00:41:08,810 --> 00:41:15,050
Oh my god.

594
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:16,070
I'm gonna wake up later.

595
00:41:16,290 --> 00:41:16,650
It'll work.

596
00:41:18,210 --> 00:41:19,190
I think I get this.

597
00:41:19,350 --> 00:41:20,230
I think you get this.

598
00:41:20,850 --> 00:41:21,370
You get it?

599
00:41:21,430 --> 00:41:21,950
That's big.

600
00:41:22,110 --> 00:41:22,290
Yeah!

601
00:41:22,990 --> 00:41:23,570
That's big lead.

602
00:41:24,730 --> 00:41:25,730
Oh my god.

603
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:28,030
Does this ever explain in lore or do we just still not know?

604
00:41:29,130 --> 00:41:29,690
Oh man.

605
00:41:30,850 --> 00:41:31,870
This is a fish that's a missile.

606
00:41:32,870 --> 00:41:33,110
My fault.

607
00:41:34,330 --> 00:41:35,150
Those are in the wilderness.

608
00:41:35,370 --> 00:41:36,710
It's just a bear with a fish missile.

609
00:41:38,410 --> 00:41:39,570
How is that launch?

610
00:41:39,770 --> 00:41:40,190
What happened?

611
00:41:40,270 --> 00:41:41,450
That's a weird launcher.

612
00:41:41,690 --> 00:41:42,790
It doesn't even look like a counter hit.

613
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:48,960
Nice job.

614
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:49,860
I'm getting destroyed here.

615
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:52,000
It's okay.

616
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:53,860
We just want to get it close, you know?

617
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:57,520
A lot of spins.

618
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:00,720
Matterhorn?

619
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:01,920
Oh, it doesn't work, I think.

620
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:03,660
That's fair.

621
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:05,180
Sorry.

622
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:08,300
Sorry, it's just the anticipation.

623
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:09,380
I'm power crushing!

624
00:42:23,050 --> 00:42:24,670
Oh, I got fucked up, man.

625
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:26,090
Oh, I had it.

626
00:42:26,470 --> 00:42:26,950
It's one round.

627
00:42:27,130 --> 00:42:28,270
It's all good.

628
00:42:28,490 --> 00:42:31,050
I don't know what I'm doing.

629
00:42:36,890 --> 00:42:38,610
She's not eating the Power Crushers anymore.

630
00:42:41,170 --> 00:42:44,550
I think I gotta have a better mix-up game off of the Queen
Bear stance.

631
00:42:44,930 --> 00:42:45,970
Round one.

632
00:42:46,830 --> 00:42:47,310
Fight.

633
00:42:50,550 --> 00:42:51,990
Sorry, I'm just so delayed.

634
00:42:52,310 --> 00:42:52,710
I apologize.

635
00:43:02,150 --> 00:43:02,810
Nice!

636
00:43:03,110 --> 00:43:04,090
Oh, nice hit!

637
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:05,790
Good shit!

638
00:43:06,030 --> 00:43:06,290
Yeah!

639
00:43:07,490 --> 00:43:08,390
Two more big dog.

640
00:43:08,770 --> 00:43:09,310
Round two.

641
00:43:10,530 --> 00:43:11,270
Got this!

642
00:43:12,270 --> 00:43:13,470
She read me there.

643
00:43:14,270 --> 00:43:15,110
It's fine.

644
00:43:16,990 --> 00:43:18,230
We're gonna get that back.

645
00:43:42,390 --> 00:43:43,830
Ah, get out of here.

646
00:43:43,850 --> 00:43:43,950
Ah, get out of here.

647
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:45,490
Oh, geez.

648
00:43:45,510 --> 00:43:45,730
Let's focus.

649
00:43:45,910 --> 00:43:46,170
Let's focus.

650
00:43:46,430 --> 00:43:47,470
Just lots of defense.

651
00:43:47,790 --> 00:43:51,510
When you get in heat slime, you could grab her or something
because he's just holding back.

652
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:52,450
It's a barrel electric.

653
00:43:52,850 --> 00:43:53,130
Or you could.

654
00:43:57,860 --> 00:44:00,780
He's doing very good at playing outside grab range now.

655
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:00,980
Good

656
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:20,000
shit.

657
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:26,680
Oh.

658
00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:28,820
Nice.

659
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:30,720
Nice.

660
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:32,080
Let's fucking go!

661
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:32,900
Yay!

662
00:44:34,580 --> 00:44:35,620
Round four.

663
00:44:36,620 --> 00:44:37,040
Fight.

664
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:42,640
Good shit.

665
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:43,560
Oh, nice hit.

666
00:44:52,450 --> 00:44:53,570
Wait for the whip here.

667
00:44:57,930 --> 00:44:58,450
Move.

668
00:44:58,590 --> 00:45:00,050
I don't know what she's doing to me.

669
00:45:02,590 --> 00:45:05,030
See, she's showing all the cards out now.

670
00:45:08,550 --> 00:45:10,290
I think I punish this.

671
00:45:10,950 --> 00:45:11,770
Let's fucking go.

672
00:45:12,050 --> 00:45:12,970
Round it up, baby.

673
00:45:13,510 --> 00:45:13,890

So please win this.

683
00:46:20,030 --> 00:46:21,050
I mean, I have to play anyway.

684
00:46:22,570 --> 00:46:23,650
You can't do that anymore.

685
00:46:25,470 --> 00:46:26,070
You can't do that anymore.

686
00:46:27,230 --> 00:46:28,270
You can't do that anymore.

687
00:46:29,570 --> 00:46:33,870
No, dude, that tiebreaker was so fucked up for my mental.

688
00:46:34,350 --> 00:46:35,930
I've never been under so much.

689
00:46:35,930 --> 00:46:37,470
Lay awake at night.

690
00:46:37,990 --> 00:46:39,670
What the fuck is this Skarskin?

691
00:46:39,950 --> 00:46:40,890
It's so ugly.

692
00:46:41,650 --> 00:46:43,930
It's there to distract you of how ugly it is.

693
00:46:44,830 --> 00:46:47,030
That's the odd future Supreme job, bro.

694
00:46:47,210 --> 00:46:49,270
He's dressed like a 50-year-old YouTuber.

695
00:46:50,610 --> 00:46:52,730
This is such a strange, you know what I mean?

696
00:46:52,950 --> 00:46:56,590
Like a guy who's like trying to exploit the algo, you know?

697
00:46:56,990 --> 00:47:00,730
Like, he's got his kids singing songs.

698
00:47:00,910 --> 00:47:01,670
You break throws.

699
00:47:01,750 --> 00:47:03,270
He's doing slime tutorials, you know?

700
00:47:04,450 --> 00:47:05,310
Let's go.

701
00:47:07,910 --> 00:47:08,530
Hey, oh.

702
00:47:08,630 --> 00:47:10,190
Yeah, I should be honest with you, but you know.

703
00:47:10,570 --> 00:47:11,190
But it works.

704
00:47:12,710 --> 00:47:13,870
That ship is crazy.

705
00:47:15,670 --> 00:47:18,190
Oh my god, what a...

706
00:47:18,190 --> 00:47:19,090
Count for me, Jack.

707
00:47:19,490 --> 00:47:19,950
Count for me.

708
00:47:20,570 --> 00:47:21,590
I forgot how to count, bro.

709
00:47:22,470 --> 00:47:22,990
Let's go!

710
00:47:23,610 --> 00:47:24,310
Let's hit that one.

711
00:47:24,610 --> 00:47:26,750
I thought that would work, but I guess not.

712
00:47:26,910 --> 00:47:27,510
No way he doesn't do it.

713
00:47:27,650 --> 00:47:28,370
Good to know.

714
00:47:28,930 --> 00:47:30,830
Good to know.

715
00:47:30,930 --> 00:47:31,670
That's all I need to know.

716
00:47:38,370 --> 00:47:39,330
Nice, Lord.

717
00:47:39,710 --> 00:47:41,430
Stop that nonsense, dude.

718
00:47:42,870 --> 00:47:43,930
That's one of the sins.

724
00:48:58,090 --> 00:49:10,890
every time I think the combo is over there's another off the
ground where did this house go That code didn't offer any

725
00:49:10,890 --> 00:49:11,530
protection!

726
00:49:12,510 --> 00:49:13,390
Get a helmet!

727
00:49:15,770 --> 00:49:16,250

729
00:49:19,710 --> 00:49:20,670
The satellite.

00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:22,290

00:49:31,070 --> 00:49:31,550
Yes!

737
00:49:33,770 --> 00:49:35,450
Why are you doing that, bro?

738
00:49:35,890 --> 00:49:36,130
Why?

739
00:49:36,410 --> 00:49:37,330
Why are you doing that?

740
00:49:37,350 --> 00:49:38,230
Don't listen to the code.

741
00:49:39,430 --> 00:49:41,610
You don't even make Tekken content.

742
00:49:41,810 --> 00:49:43,350
You can't even upload that anywhere.

743
00:49:45,230 --> 00:49:47,130
He's not even creating content.

744
00:49:47,310 --> 00:49:48,270
He likes that move.

745
00:49:53,300 --> 00:49:53,860

Oh, my God.

00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:15,260
It never stopped.

751
00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:16,700

This dude is starting to move this.

759
00:51:22,260 --> 00:51:22,920
What the fuck?

760
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:25,720
Whoops.

761
00:51:28,660 --> 00:51:31,200
He's trying to create a character into the match.

762
00:51:35,940 --> 00:51:36,020
Pecking.

763
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:36,480

Pecking.

Yeah, that move just for him.

766
00:51:38,020 --> 00:51:38,940
I hate Tekken players.

767
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:40,880

768
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:41,900
Dude, you're goaded.

769
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:43,080

Let's go, dude.

775
00:52:20,060 --> 00:52:20,520
Oh, hell.

776
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:21,120
Oh, hell.

777
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:22,340
That was so beautiful.

778
00:52:22,860 --> 00:52:23,800
What a good round of tech.

779
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:25,560
That was such, that was insane.

780
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:27,640
What a fucking freak.

781
00:52:28,180 --> 00:52:31,060
He's showing moves none of us have seen before.

782
00:52:34,460 --> 00:52:36,740
Guess for the fucking game, bro.

783
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:38,700
What was that ground and pound move?

784
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:40,960
I've never seen that in tech.

785
00:52:41,380 --> 00:52:41,940
The one?

786
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:43,000
The slider.

787
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:45,180
The one where you just jumped on him.

788
00:52:45,180 --> 00:52:46,620
The one where you just jumped on top of him.

789
00:52:46,620 --> 00:52:55,160

I've never seen that before.

798
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:28,400
I think it's guaranteed now after the buffs.

799
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:30,280
I actually got to replay that one.

800
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:31,040
That happened to me once.

801
00:54:31,940 --> 00:54:34,420
Why are they showing you everything in just round robin one?

802
00:54:35,780 --> 00:54:37,280
Okay, we're getting hit by G-Clust.

803
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:38,400
Doesn't look good for Unk.

804
00:54:40,940 --> 00:54:41,960
Wow, okay.

805
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:43,820
Slinky ass mare.

806
00:54:44,100 --> 00:54:44,640
What the fuck?

807
00:54:44,700 --> 00:54:46,000
This bear is oiled up.

808
00:54:46,460 --> 00:54:47,920
Heat roll into...

809
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:48,240
What?

810
00:54:48,460 --> 00:54:49,040
That was fun.

811
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:52,120
Good adaptation.

812
00:54:54,820 --> 00:54:55,420
Nice.

813
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:56,220
Nice.

814
00:54:58,080 --> 00:54:58,680
Nice.

815
00:55:02,660 --> 00:55:04,580
You're not eating any of his bullshit.

816
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:06,320
Uh-oh.

817
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,860
Like, the Dow Bag 2 is honest there.

818
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:19,440
Nice.

819
00:55:19,900 --> 00:55:20,820
Good shit.

820
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:24,880
Can I just say something?

821
00:55:24,980 --> 00:55:26,360
They have Akuma on their team.

822
00:55:27,100 --> 00:55:28,180
And I beat their Asusena.

823
00:55:28,380 --> 00:55:28,860
Just saying.

824
00:55:49,650 --> 00:55:50,530
Damn it.

825
00:55:50,930 --> 00:55:52,170
You just beat him.

826
00:55:52,490 --> 00:55:53,190
Yeah, he was.

827
00:55:54,750 --> 00:55:55,190
Nice.

828
00:55:55,890 --> 00:55:58,730
Dude, that rolled butt, whatever the fuck it is, that's
crazy.

829
00:55:59,010 --> 00:55:59,970
That's a good move.

830
00:56:01,250 --> 00:56:03,110
Yeah, that's the first time I'm seeing that too.

831
00:56:03,470 --> 00:56:05,090
We're gonna apply that to you, Slime.

832
00:56:05,890 --> 00:56:08,790
Yeah, I feel like in heat, he has even more shit now.

833
00:56:09,830 --> 00:56:13,390
Yeah, and the chip damage remover, whatever the fuck they
call it.

834
00:56:13,670 --> 00:56:15,450
How did Kuma do on the last bet?

835
00:56:16,350 --> 00:56:17,450
Kuma got some buffs.

836
00:56:17,750 --> 00:56:19,010
His hand got even more.

837
00:56:31,300 --> 00:56:31,920
Damn it.

838
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:32,940
Oh.

839
00:56:34,220 --> 00:56:37,000
I need to stop.

840
00:56:38,140 --> 00:56:39,340
Mikey's getting his revenge.

841
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:42,540
All he had to do was use a bag.

842
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:43,500
Guaranteed.

843
00:56:43,660 --> 00:56:44,300
That is crazy.

844
00:56:44,460 --> 00:56:44,800
Wow.

845
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:46,620
Oh, I had never stopped.

846
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:47,300
Fight.

847
00:56:49,120 --> 00:56:50,580
That's the thing about Tekken combos.

848
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:51,340
I just...

849
00:56:51,340 --> 00:56:53,060
I'd just be taking 40.

850
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:55,480
You know what?

851
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:57,340
He showed his hand too early.

860
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:19,500

That sounds very fun.

886
01:00:26,450 --> 01:00:26,730

absurdly low expectations.

He's just hitting buttons.

899
01:01:40,010 --> 01:01:41,070
Bro, he was true, though.

900
01:01:41,210 --> 01:01:41,750
He was spitting.

901
01:01:42,130 --> 01:01:44,750
At that point, I've been him.

902
01:01:45,030 --> 01:01:48,250
I was him last night against the Huarong and a Lee and a
Lars.

903
01:01:48,410 --> 01:01:49,150
Like, I get it.

904
01:01:49,350 --> 01:01:49,730
He's right.

905
01:01:50,010 --> 01:01:51,410
Bro, he's just hitting buttons.

906
01:01:52,110 --> 01:01:54,910
At that point in the set, I was like, we go shoulder into
R1.

907
01:01:55,010 --> 01:01:55,350
Fuck it.

908
01:01:55,390 --> 01:01:58,230
We just, just everything out all in on this.

909
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:13,760
well i shouldn't go into a match in case the lobby goes back
up well i jumped into rank just to make sure i'm warmed up

910
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:20,840
and stuff true i'm gonna continue i'm gonna do a quick match
oh okay then i have time then if you're all in a quick match

911
01:02:20,840 --> 01:02:31,080
then i can't be blamed yeah we're in it we're in it together
what are you gonna do disqualifiers we cannot do that whole

912
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:40,020

in quick play so i rather being quick play than the

913
01:02:40,020 --> 01:02:41,280
tournament sorry guys

914
01:02:45,360 --> 01:02:47,580

combos it's probably gonna take a little while i'm gonna go

916
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:08,880
to the bathroom i know how to do combos but i can't
implement it into the game like i know how to do that

917
01:03:12,360 --> 01:03:20,020
I don't understand Why can't my fingers do this in the real
game?

918
01:03:23,060 --> 01:03:25,080
I do block!

919
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:31,120
Did he stop that?

920
01:03:31,360 --> 01:03:32,360
I do!

921
01:03:33,120 --> 01:03:36,980
It's just that I stop blocking Because I was like, I can out
hit.

922
01:03:37,340 --> 01:03:39,740
Why is the red rank playing against me?

923
01:03:40,580 --> 01:03:41,540
Quick match!

924
01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:49,540

927
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:56,620

Oh, shit, sorry.

929
01:04:00,080 --> 01:04:02,720
Sometimes my hands are in the wrong position, too.

930
01:04:02,820 --> 01:04:04,820
I think that's also my issue.

931
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:05,340
Oh, my God.

932
01:04:05,420 --> 01:04:05,980

you're fucking terrible if you lose one round off of me

940
01:05:02,920 --> 01:05:11,240
you're so bad imagine being red rink and losing at one round
from a fucking person who has three days of experience

941
01:05:14,640 --> 01:05:16,760
This play before

942
01:05:22,590 --> 01:05:32,030
You're so fucking bad Imagine being ranked and losing that

01:05:53,370 --> 01:05:54,890
Dude, I like Grappa.

946

There.

947
01:05:56,870 --> 01:05:57,970
You like that Grappa?

948
01:05:58,650 --> 01:05:59,630
Is that what you mean?

949
01:06:00,470 --> 01:06:00,650
Oh.

950
01:06:04,390 --> 01:06:05,070
Oh god.

951
01:06:07,910 --> 01:06:08,330
Oh god.

952
01:06:08,590 --> 01:06:10,330
Please let me do this move, please!

953
01:06:10,950 --> 01:06:11,150
Okay.

954
01:06:14,670 --> 01:06:15,570
She's so...

955
01:06:15,590 --> 01:06:17,650
It's a quick match!

956
01:06:23,410 --> 01:06:23,910
Alright.

957
01:06:26,590 --> 01:06:27,250
It's fine.

958
01:06:27,910 --> 01:06:29,230
He's red rank.

959
01:06:30,270 --> 01:06:31,710
He's... It's fine!

960
01:06:32,010 --> 01:06:33,530
He's red rank!

961
01:06:33,930 --> 01:06:34,930
Just...

962
01:06:34,930 --> 01:06:43,090
The fact that he lost one round to me when I had three days
of Tekken.

963
01:06:48,470 --> 01:06:50,030
That's the sad part.

964
01:06:53,190 --> 01:06:54,330
I need to like...

965
01:06:54,330 --> 01:06:58,190
Okay, there's like this move that I can never get correct.

966
01:06:58,710 --> 01:07:02,990
Like the kick, like the low kick right here.

967
01:07:03,290 --> 01:07:03,850
Please!

968
01:07:06,370 --> 01:07:08,130
The one, two kick.

969
01:07:08,250 --> 01:07:09,890
Why can't I do it?

970
01:07:11,530 --> 01:07:12,090
Please.

971
01:07:12,270 --> 01:07:12,730
Oh, there you go.

972
01:07:12,830 --> 01:07:13,410
This move.

973
01:07:13,510 --> 01:07:14,770
I keep fucking it up.

974
01:07:15,590 --> 01:07:17,150
I keep fucking it up.

975
01:07:17,570 --> 01:07:18,170
The two.

976
01:07:20,250 --> 01:07:20,690
Please.

977
01:07:21,290 --> 01:07:23,030
Why can't you do this kick?

978
01:07:23,510 --> 01:07:24,130
There you go.

979
01:07:24,350 --> 01:07:25,070
That's why.

980
01:07:26,350 --> 01:07:30,070
And then it's supposed to be like this and then not that.

981
01:07:31,130 --> 01:07:32,030
It's the timing.

982
01:07:33,330 --> 01:07:35,310
I'm not good at timing, apparently.

983
01:07:36,970 --> 01:07:38,770
Get ready for the next battle.

984
01:07:39,350 --> 01:07:39,930
Exactly.

985
01:07:41,330 --> 01:07:42,050
These people.

986
01:07:42,210 --> 01:07:45,570
Okay, the thing is, these people have much longer
techniques.

987
01:07:45,590 --> 01:07:57,590
hours and days of doing combos in me and I'm coming in with
three days here any round I take is like a win for me with

988
01:07:57,590 --> 01:08:11,430
the amount of tech experience I have whoa what the fuck okay
what she expected oh okay you tell this person is a team

989
01:08:11,430 --> 01:08:12,950
against King Bilal.

990
01:08:13,850 --> 01:08:21,430
There you go, because I know you like to duck, so...

991
01:08:25,260 --> 01:08:26,300
Oh god.

992
01:08:28,160 --> 01:08:29,420
Wi-Fi warriors?

993
01:08:29,480 --> 01:08:31,180
See on Wi-Fi or my own Wi-Fi?

994
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:32,560
Or is it my PC?

995
01:08:33,420 --> 01:08:35,440
We'll find... we'll figure it out here.

996
01:08:36,260 --> 01:08:36,640
Yay!

997
01:08:38,380 --> 01:08:39,320
What the fuck?

998
01:08:39,400 --> 01:08:40,840
Sometimes I don't do the...

999
01:08:40,840 --> 01:08:42,140
Jump the...

1000
01:08:43,180 --> 01:08:44,020
The low punch.

1001
01:08:44,360 --> 01:08:44,960
No, not low punch.

1002
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:45,640
The low kick.

1003
01:08:46,780 --> 01:08:48,780
Oh, it's because my fingers were on the wrong area.

1004
01:08:52,370 --> 01:08:52,850
Please.

1005
01:08:53,490 --> 01:08:53,770
Please.

1006
01:08:54,890 --> 01:08:55,490
Thank you.

1007
01:08:55,890 --> 01:08:56,770
That's all I care.

1008
01:08:57,510 --> 01:08:57,870
Please.

1009
01:08:58,630 --> 01:08:58,930
Please.

1010
01:09:05,250 --> 01:09:05,730
Same.

1011
01:09:14,550 --> 01:09:16,090
Doki, please, I know.

1012
01:09:16,970 --> 01:09:17,630
I...

1013
01:09:18,460 --> 01:09:21,810
I, like, tell that to myself every day.

1014
01:09:29,670 --> 01:09:30,330
Please!

1015
01:09:31,470 --> 01:09:32,570
Oh my god!

1016
01:09:36,450 --> 01:09:40,090
I got a perfect the one time my combos actually work.

1017
01:09:40,730 --> 01:09:43,530
The one time my fingers actually work for me.

1018
01:09:44,550 --> 01:09:45,450
Do you think she's gonna duck?

1019
01:09:45,690 --> 01:09:47,050
Okay, she's just gonna beat me up.

1020
01:09:50,850 --> 01:09:52,050
Ducky, please.

1021
01:09:54,830 --> 01:09:55,250
Okay.

1022
01:09:56,690 --> 01:09:58,130
Guys, look.

1023
01:09:58,650 --> 01:09:59,450
We know my place.

1024
01:10:00,490 --> 01:10:01,970
We know my place.

1025
01:10:05,530 --> 01:10:12,790
You guys, you think I can improve, like, improve 10 speeds
in the next three days?

1026
01:10:12,930 --> 01:10:13,930
We'll find out.

1027
01:10:14,550 --> 01:10:19,830
Okay, let's play against what I don't care people are like
people keep telling me to discriminate against the Wi-Fi

1028
01:10:19,830 --> 01:10:23,950
players And reject all Wi-Fi players, but I was like I
really don't care

1029
01:10:30,050 --> 01:10:32,030
I don't care

1030
01:10:35,070 --> 01:10:36,230
Wait do we join?

1031
01:10:37,450 --> 01:10:45,990
Wait, which stage are we Oh shit All right Don't worry
Nobody said anything!

1032
01:10:46,210 --> 01:10:47,950
How is I supposed to know where...

1033
01:10:47,950 --> 01:10:49,250
Oh shit, I'm not focused.

1034
01:10:49,350 --> 01:10:50,310
I was looking at my discord.

1035
01:10:55,430 --> 01:10:56,470
Alright, here we go.

1036
01:10:58,330 --> 01:10:59,690
Oh my god, he dashed the ducks.

1037
01:10:59,910 --> 01:11:00,610
Who would have thought?

1038
01:11:01,350 --> 01:11:02,650
Coach, I got a question for you.

1039
01:11:04,130 --> 01:11:05,030
Yeah, what's up, bro?

1040
01:11:05,370 --> 01:11:06,490
You want a match right now?

1041
01:11:07,290 --> 01:11:07,730
Yeah.

1042
01:11:08,610 --> 01:11:09,750
Let me know when you're out.

1043
01:11:10,250 --> 01:11:10,690
I...

1044
01:11:10,690 --> 01:11:13,010
I want your insight on something real quick.

1045
01:11:13,390 --> 01:11:14,130
Round two.

1046
01:11:15,270 --> 01:11:16,570
Please, I'm a believer.

1047
01:11:16,590 --> 01:11:28,690
I think you came in thinking that I'm gonna go far this is
why I am the moral support it's nice that somebody believes

1048
01:11:28,690 --> 01:11:36,070
in me you know wait you actually block Lowe's bro what the
fuck what's wrong with you do you think he blocked this no

1049
01:11:36,070 --> 01:11:47,630
this is literally my one move if all else fails if all else
fails I I have that one move.

1050
01:11:47,850 --> 01:11:49,830
Now imagine losing a fucking Rana off of me.

1051
01:11:53,110 --> 01:11:53,970
What are you gonna do?

1052
01:11:54,310 --> 01:11:54,870
Do I do this?

1053
01:11:59,230 --> 01:11:59,670
Hey.

1054
01:12:00,290 --> 01:12:01,170
Do I do this again?

1055
01:12:03,610 --> 01:12:04,050
Hey.

1056
01:12:05,130 --> 01:12:06,010
Do I do this again?

1057
01:12:06,590 --> 01:12:07,190
Alright, no.

1058
01:12:07,290 --> 01:12:07,970
He fucking learned.

1059
01:12:08,110 --> 01:12:08,370
Okay.

1060
01:12:09,030 --> 01:12:10,290
But what if I do it again?

1061
01:12:11,110 --> 01:12:12,210
He does not learn.

1062
01:12:12,650 --> 01:12:15,270
I told you, that's like the only thing I know how to do.

1063
01:12:15,270 --> 01:12:16,030
Oh,

1064
01:12:20,140 --> 01:12:20,460
God.

1065
01:12:21,500 --> 01:12:21,780
Okay.

1066
01:12:22,100 --> 01:12:23,140
Do you think he's gonna learn again?

1067
01:12:24,260 --> 01:12:24,680
Nope.

1068
01:12:32,580 --> 01:12:33,600
Alright, let's try again.

1069
01:12:33,800 --> 01:12:34,440
Do you think he learned?

1070
01:12:35,320 --> 01:12:36,440
Oh, he did.

1071
01:12:36,580 --> 01:12:38,740
He learned because he's trying to get closer now.

1072
01:12:41,080 --> 01:12:44,000
He's not giving me space anymore.

1073
01:12:46,720 --> 01:12:47,380
There's no...

1074
01:12:47,400 --> 01:12:49,580
No way she would do it again, right?

1075
01:12:50,260 --> 01:12:51,820
But there was a way.

1076
01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:52,780
You think he learned?

1077
01:12:54,320 --> 01:12:54,700
No.

1078
01:12:55,660 --> 01:12:56,820
You think he learned?

1079
01:12:58,280 --> 01:12:58,740
No.

1080
01:13:02,620 --> 01:13:04,500
Do you think he learned, guys?

1081
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:06,180
No.

1082
01:13:06,640 --> 01:13:07,000
No.

1083
01:13:07,140 --> 01:13:07,620
I don't know.

1084
01:13:17,400 --> 01:13:18,920
He doesn't learn!

1085
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:20,680
I told you!

1086
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:24,040
I told you, that's, like, literally the only thing I know!

1087
01:13:27,080 --> 01:13:33,840
Well, not the only thing, but one of the things that I
consistently do is just, like...

1088
01:13:37,520 --> 01:13:39,980
You think you finally learned?

1089
01:13:40,820 --> 01:13:42,580
Guys, I don't think you learned.

1090
01:13:45,560 --> 01:13:46,880
That's so sad.

1091
01:13:48,260 --> 01:13:56,360
That's the thing is I can't do that for real on people
though Because everybody else trained for like 20 plus hours

1092
01:13:56,360 --> 01:14:09,500
Not the one and done Yeah I do that to everybody I do that
to all the players They never do Get ready for the next

1093
01:14:09,500 --> 01:14:19,860
battle Yeah it's a bit tough That was so toxic.

1094
01:14:20,040 --> 01:14:24,020
I was just like, I'm just like, bro, I'm clearly you can
like beat the shit out of me.

1095
01:14:24,100 --> 01:14:26,120
I'm not going to fucking give you another game.

1096
01:14:26,700 --> 01:14:31,200
Like, I'm just trying to fucking have fun.

1097
01:14:33,280 --> 01:14:34,800
Okay, I did not mean to jump there.

1098
01:14:36,380 --> 01:14:37,180
That was an accident.

1099
01:14:37,320 --> 01:14:38,900
Guys, I think this guy would learn, though.

1100
01:14:39,900 --> 01:14:40,900
This guy might learn.

1101
01:14:42,440 --> 01:14:42,760
Guys.

1102
01:14:43,140 --> 01:14:43,440
Whoa.

1103
01:14:44,460 --> 01:14:45,820
You think this guy would learn, though?

1104
01:14:46,440 --> 01:14:47,040
We'll figure it out.

1105
01:14:47,340 --> 01:14:47,560
Yeah.

1106
01:14:50,080 --> 01:14:59,580
there we go okay give me space give me space so i can see if
you learn oh he does see why can't that other guy do it

1107
01:14:59,580 --> 01:15:03,020
because he because you're not yellow

1108
01:15:06,940 --> 01:15:14,280
as the attorney ended no we're just waiting for the next
round to start he didn't need to learn because like he he

1109
01:15:14,280 --> 01:15:21,020
actually is a good good enough okay i know some people
That's good enough for me.

1110
01:15:21,440 --> 01:15:23,120
That's a good rank for me.

1111
01:15:23,540 --> 01:15:25,060
With me as a player.

1112
01:15:26,500 --> 01:15:27,360
That's a lot.

1113
01:15:27,820 --> 01:15:28,440
Yeah, this guy.

1114
01:15:28,580 --> 01:15:29,660
See, this guy knows?

1115
01:15:30,920 --> 01:15:32,920
Like, why can't the other guy do that?

1116
01:15:36,120 --> 01:15:38,260
I don't know why I keep trying to do it.

1117
01:15:38,420 --> 01:15:40,340
I was just like, maybe it'll be different, you know?

1118
01:15:44,830 --> 01:15:45,270
Okay.

1119
01:15:45,450 --> 01:15:46,430
Well, this is scary.

1120
01:15:49,590 --> 01:15:55,730
This guy is It was just that guy's first time playing King.

1121
01:15:56,070 --> 01:15:57,090
Bro, he's yellow ranked.

1122
01:15:57,270 --> 01:16:01,110
There's no way that that guy was the first time he played.

1123
01:16:02,050 --> 01:16:02,570
Oh, God.

1124
01:16:02,770 --> 01:16:03,310
He's faster.

1125
01:16:04,950 --> 01:16:05,990
He's so much faster.

1126
01:16:08,350 --> 01:16:08,610
No!

1127
01:16:11,630 --> 01:16:12,650
Oh, my God.

1128
01:16:12,830 --> 01:16:13,470
I'm goodbye.

1129
01:16:16,730 --> 01:16:17,830
Oh, goodbye.

1130
01:16:19,670 --> 01:16:20,790
It was...

1131
01:16:20,810 --> 01:16:22,490
This is his first game.

1132
01:16:27,690 --> 01:16:29,730
As long as you have time, you hit up your coach.

1133
01:16:31,270 --> 01:16:31,850
It sucks.

1134
01:16:31,970 --> 01:16:33,190
Because, like, oh my gosh.

1135
01:16:33,550 --> 01:16:36,590
Okay, so, like, hey, Brawlbro and I were talking.

1136
01:16:36,910 --> 01:16:39,850
Like, I think, like, the day before yesterday.

1137
01:16:40,510 --> 01:16:41,590
And then we were...

1138
01:16:41,590 --> 01:16:43,950
Because, like, I was like, what the fuck?

1139
01:16:44,230 --> 01:16:46,130
Because, like, it was supposed to be Connor, right?

1140
01:16:46,450 --> 01:16:48,870
Connor was supposed to be in my seed.

1141
01:16:49,310 --> 01:16:51,430
And then Connor got replaced by another player.

1142
01:16:51,450 --> 01:16:52,710
That's played Tekken before.

1143
01:16:53,110 --> 01:16:53,890
I was like...

1144
01:16:53,910 --> 01:16:54,810
Wait, what the fuck?

1145
01:16:55,130 --> 01:17:00,990
Like, she plays a lot of Tekken.

1146
01:17:01,470 --> 01:17:02,970
And I was like, wait a minute.

1147
01:17:03,210 --> 01:17:05,530
Sejab told me this is for newbies only.

1148
01:17:06,110 --> 01:17:06,690
What the...

1149
01:17:06,690 --> 01:17:08,630
What am I doing here?

1150
01:17:10,890 --> 01:17:12,550
I was just like, what?

1151
01:17:13,710 --> 01:17:15,690
What am I doing here?

1152
01:17:19,710 --> 01:17:24,830
I'm just like, oh my God, I'm going to get absolutely
destroyed.

1153
01:17:27,990 --> 01:17:36,070
oh hey that this king knows what he's doing bro he's like
this he's like stars because he knows i want to do that

1154
01:17:36,070 --> 01:17:52,990
thing that that only i can do please the only other yeah but
like gumi when she gets into a game she plays a lot of hours

1155
01:17:52,990 --> 01:17:58,030
of that Okay, I should actually play this game, though.

1156
01:18:00,390 --> 01:18:02,730
Sorry, I was having a conversation, fellow King player.

1157
01:18:03,490 --> 01:18:04,370
I have the stream.

1158
01:18:06,070 --> 01:18:07,130
I have the stream.

1159
01:18:08,430 --> 01:18:09,410
I think it was alright.

1160
01:18:09,650 --> 01:18:11,430
Boomi's been fucking grinding.

1161
01:18:11,950 --> 01:18:14,710
You guys behind your backs, and that's about it.

1162
01:18:15,710 --> 01:18:17,490
She's actually been grinding!

1163
01:18:17,770 --> 01:18:19,950
I had other obligations!

1164
01:18:22,270 --> 01:18:25,110
You had a question or something before I got pulled into
the...

1165
01:18:25,370 --> 01:18:27,170
Yeah, let's say, hold on.

1166
01:18:27,290 --> 01:18:29,310
Let's say I want to get...

1167
01:18:29,310 --> 01:18:32,110
Actually, I don't want to rank so I can do it because we
can't get them all.

1168
01:18:32,150 --> 01:18:33,370
Oh my god, does this...

1169
01:18:33,370 --> 01:18:33,590
Hold on.

1170
01:18:35,670 --> 01:18:40,010
Oh my, sometimes my fucking down doesn't register and that
makes me sad.

1171
01:18:42,430 --> 01:18:43,910
Oh, wait, you should block that.

1172
01:18:44,030 --> 01:18:44,710
You're a king player.

1173
01:18:46,390 --> 01:18:47,050
You block this?

1174
01:18:47,290 --> 01:18:48,350
Oh, he does.

1175
01:18:52,990 --> 01:18:57,010
Let's say I want to go That's so many obligate.

1176
01:18:57,030 --> 01:18:58,750
This was the only week I was free.

1177
01:18:59,230 --> 01:19:00,630
I was fully free.

1178
01:19:00,770 --> 01:19:01,290
Oh my god.

1179
01:19:01,370 --> 01:19:07,930
Everyone cried it so much Whatever you're doing do not
bother around start.

1180
01:19:08,470 --> 01:19:08,770
Holy shit.

1181
01:19:08,850 --> 01:19:16,150
Oh, it's because I'm doing monitor capture That's probably
what it is Maybe you want do you want to see do you want to

1182
01:19:16,150 --> 01:19:16,310
try?

1183
01:19:16,750 --> 01:19:26,710
Yes, like my only hours to run Tekken was like it starts at
like around eight to ten like around 8 to 10 p.m.

1184
01:19:26,750 --> 01:19:30,330
is when I start grinding Tekken the last three days.

1185
01:19:30,970 --> 01:19:33,810
Well, wait, the first day, the first day I grinded Tekken.

1186
01:19:34,590 --> 01:19:38,630
The first day I had a lot of time because it was like right
after announcing a WrestleTuber.

1187
01:19:39,330 --> 01:19:41,150
Then I went straight into it.

1188
01:19:41,750 --> 01:19:49,170
And then I grinded and then I started and then I grinded, I
think like the day after my day starts for grinding because

1189
01:19:49,170 --> 01:19:52,690
I have to do my other obligations first, like my other work
hours stuff first.

1190
01:19:55,350 --> 01:19:55,890
10 p.m.

1191
01:19:55,930 --> 01:19:56,810
That's when I start.

1192
01:19:57,590 --> 01:19:59,570
But then everybody else starts way earlier.

1193
01:20:00,950 --> 01:20:01,330
72?

1194
01:20:02,550 --> 01:20:06,590
You can, okay, see how much it is if you just back 3 into
the Jaguar 5.

1195
01:20:06,670 --> 01:20:09,970
But like, like, for now, now I have a lot of time.

1196
01:20:10,110 --> 01:20:11,410
Now I have a lot of time.

1197
01:20:11,830 --> 01:20:14,250
But like, everybody is now like 20 hours.

1198
01:20:14,750 --> 01:20:19,990
Like, I heard like SK has like 90 hours plus when I started.

1199
01:20:20,510 --> 01:20:22,150
I don't care about optimizing it, yeah.

1200
01:20:22,390 --> 01:20:22,990
Let's just pause.

1201
01:20:24,410 --> 01:20:28,510
That's way No, I meant like, no, I didn't mean like 8 to 10.

1202
01:20:28,610 --> 01:20:31,370
I mean, I start at either 8 o'clock or 10 p.m.

1203
01:20:31,410 --> 01:20:34,950
And then I would play until 4 in the morning.

1204
01:20:35,370 --> 01:20:37,070
I would play until 4 in the morning.

1205
01:20:37,370 --> 01:20:40,850
I would start at like 8 to 7 or 7 to 10 p.m.

1206
01:20:40,850 --> 01:20:43,050
And then I'd grind until 4 a.m.

1207
01:20:43,210 --> 01:20:47,850
But then like, by the time I started grinding, SK had
fucking 90 hours.

1208
01:20:48,410 --> 01:20:52,910
And like, I think she has like 130 plus hours now.

1209
01:20:53,190 --> 01:20:54,210
And here I am.

1210
01:20:55,350 --> 01:21:03,890
Use this move And I was looking at the intel report I was
looking at the intel report And then all the other Nubies

1211
01:21:03,890 --> 01:21:14,250
were like close to Red Rank already I was like what the fuck
I was just like And some Nubies have had Tech experience

1212
01:21:14,250 --> 01:21:18,090
before And Rank I was like what am I doing here?

1213
01:21:18,870 --> 01:21:20,350
What am I doing here?

1214
01:21:20,370 --> 01:21:34,250
I thought Nubies meant As a Nubie Nubie Oh that as well i i
went in thinking newbie meant actually newbie what's this on

1215
01:21:34,250 --> 01:21:43,870

have not met newbie i'll pop that i'm not cute okay i can't

1216
01:21:43,870 --> 01:21:53,350

knows how to no she doesn't give me space for this i got

1217
01:21:53,350 --> 01:21:56,270
sent to the ones i I did.

1218
01:21:56,550 --> 01:21:58,590
Maybe I can fit in one match.

1219
01:21:58,830 --> 01:21:59,590
I did.

1220
01:22:00,230 --> 01:22:01,910
I got sent to the fucking Gulag.

1221
01:22:01,910 --> 01:22:02,910
Oh, he made the lucky right now.

1222
01:22:03,550 --> 01:22:04,310
Oh my god.

1223
01:22:04,410 --> 01:22:05,170
I don't get the one.

1224
01:22:05,170 --> 01:22:06,990
Oh wait, that was not what I wanted to do.

1225
01:22:07,010 --> 01:22:09,890
I guess tomorrow or in two days, I'll just scream way
earlier.

1226
01:22:10,950 --> 01:22:13,350
Yeah, like the average was much higher.

1227
01:22:13,730 --> 01:22:15,030
But I'm having fun though.

1228
01:22:15,290 --> 01:22:17,130
Learning Tekken for...

1229
01:22:17,130 --> 01:22:19,050
Wait, why am I playing against a red?

1230
01:22:19,070 --> 01:22:21,550
Every single round went game five, by the way.

1231
01:22:21,850 --> 01:22:23,550
So everything is like dead even right now.

1232
01:22:23,570 --> 01:22:24,250
Alright, it's fine.

1233
01:22:24,550 --> 01:22:25,170
She's red.

1234
01:22:27,150 --> 01:22:32,710
I'm having fun though, but it's like, I'm just like, what
the fuck am I doing here?

1235
01:22:34,270 --> 01:22:38,330
You know, if you guys do end up burying me this time around,
I'm totally cool with that.

1236
01:22:38,930 --> 01:22:41,250
I guess, because I did a lot of work last time.

1237
01:22:42,050 --> 01:22:43,510
You only played a couple sets.

1238
01:22:43,550 --> 01:22:45,950
That's how I'm feeling, but I'm still trying, right?

1239
01:22:46,690 --> 01:22:47,350
I'm trying.

1240
01:22:47,350 --> 01:22:48,830
That man was 5-0, bro.

1241
01:22:49,050 --> 01:22:51,210
I mean, you lose.

1242
01:22:51,330 --> 01:22:52,750
I only lost to one person.

1243
01:22:52,850 --> 01:22:53,510
What did you do?

1244
01:22:53,630 --> 01:22:55,230
You know, you beat one guy.

1245
01:22:55,350 --> 01:23:05,910

before

1257
01:25:18,670 --> 01:25:31,980
all right that's right i gotta get into the mental of
winning of one hit in the combo and you could just also just

1258
01:25:31,980 --> 01:25:40,680
use it as a learning experience too that's true that's true
it's only round robin one i'm going to give them like a

1259
01:25:40,680 --> 01:25:49,960
false sense of security so when the finals hit are you still
in the game dokey yeah i'm like loading up we're in now i

1274
01:26:40,040 --> 01:26:40,280
Bro.

1275
01:26:42,160 --> 01:26:42,380

Why am I so unlucky?

1278
01:26:50,310 --> 01:26:51,990
Why am I so unlucky?

1279
01:26:52,230 --> 01:26:53,150

Okay.

1284
01:26:58,190 --> 01:26:58,950

Yeah, they learned.

1290
01:27:31,670 --> 01:27:33,390
They learned.

1291
01:27:33,390 --> 01:27:33,670
They learned.

1292
01:27:33,830 --> 01:27:35,830
They learned down on the controller.

1293
01:27:36,370 --> 01:27:36,490
Wait?

1294
01:27:37,210 --> 01:27:38,270
What the fuck?

1295
01:27:41,650 --> 01:27:45,030
I think now is when we use the RDC technique.

1296
01:27:46,230 --> 01:27:46,810
You can do it.

1297
01:27:47,110 --> 01:27:47,850
I bet it'll work.

1298
01:27:48,510 --> 01:27:48,610
True.

1299
01:27:49,170 --> 01:27:49,690
Oh,

1300
01:27:52,950 --> 01:27:52,950

1301
01:27:53,250 --> 01:27:55,690
Now I'm gonna, in a long ass combo.

1302
01:27:59,930 --> 01:28:00,670
Oh no!

1303
01:28:01,550 --> 01:28:02,730
How is she so fast?

1304
01:28:06,980 --> 01:28:07,500
Nice.

1305
01:28:08,080 --> 01:28:08,360
Okay.

1306
01:28:10,140 --> 01:28:10,240
Oh.

1307
01:28:10,660 --> 01:28:11,860
No, I'm not fast enough.

1308
01:28:14,600 --> 01:28:16,120
I didn't feel one plus two after.

1309
01:28:16,400 --> 01:28:17,700
I just like go for it.

1310
01:28:19,360 --> 01:28:20,800
Why is she so fast?

1311
01:28:21,840 --> 01:28:23,060
Yeah, rain is cheap.

1312
01:28:24,900 --> 01:28:26,680
Is this why everybody plays her?

1313
01:28:28,100 --> 01:28:28,620
Oh.

1314
01:28:29,080 --> 01:28:29,620
It's all right.

1315
01:28:29,680 --> 01:28:30,900
I got my two rounds.

1316
01:28:31,020 --> 01:28:31,740
Now I'm happy.

1317
01:28:32,500 --> 01:28:34,040
That was impressive.

1318
01:28:36,960 --> 01:28:38,440
You almost had lock in.

1319
01:28:38,660 --> 01:28:40,200
Lock in and this is actually yours.

1320
01:28:41,580 --> 01:28:42,680
I believe so hard.

1321
01:28:44,080 --> 01:28:44,560
Okay.

1322
01:28:45,300 --> 01:28:45,300
Alright.

1323
01:28:45,900 --> 01:28:47,460
At least somebody believes in me.

1324
01:28:48,560 --> 01:28:49,320
Hey, I believe.

1325
01:28:50,160 --> 01:28:52,860
But do you believe in me in your heart though?

1326
01:28:53,540 --> 01:28:54,920
Or is it just word?

1327
01:28:55,700 --> 01:28:55,860
Yes.

1328
01:28:56,020 --> 01:28:56,640
No, I believe.

1329
01:28:57,480 --> 01:28:58,500
What you just did.

1330
01:28:59,800 --> 01:29:02,040
I think if you get your offense off, you're good.

1331
01:29:02,060 --> 01:29:13,380
Just run your stuff Oh my god Please Please escape Please I
thought you were going gentle on me Escape please let me

1332
01:29:13,380 --> 01:29:14,200

1333
01:29:19,040 --> 01:29:34,320
Oh come on Nice mix with that shit Oh god Hey remember your
fight or flight Yeah Oh,

1334
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,140
SK like knows that I want to grab her.

1335
01:29:40,420 --> 01:29:42,260
She like stays on the ground.

1336
01:29:45,280 --> 01:29:47,300
I can't believe she knows King players like to grab.

1337
01:29:49,300 --> 01:29:51,300
Yeah, honestly, who taught her this?

1338
01:29:51,520 --> 01:29:53,440
I know, it's actually crazy.

1339
01:29:54,280 --> 01:29:55,180
Like 100 hours.

1340
01:29:56,080 --> 01:29:58,780
It must be like all the King players she fought.

1341
01:29:59,260 --> 01:30:00,220
Forbidden knowledge.

1342
01:30:00,780 --> 01:30:01,040
Okay.

1343
01:30:02,920 --> 01:30:05,660
Oh, I thought it was gonna land.

1344
01:30:05,700 --> 01:30:06,800
Me too.

1345
01:30:07,380 --> 01:30:08,440
Rain is cheap.

1346
01:30:09,620 --> 01:30:11,760
There's a rain here, so it's just rain.

1347
01:30:11,940 --> 01:30:12,960
Rain is cheap, that's not.

1348
01:30:13,180 --> 01:30:15,060
Oh my god, she ducked!

1349
01:30:16,020 --> 01:30:17,140
Stop ducking!

1350
01:30:18,500 --> 01:30:19,860
It's being taller!

1351
01:30:25,040 --> 01:30:25,600
Goodbye.

1352
01:30:26,100 --> 01:30:28,180
I had a good one set.

1353
01:30:33,650 --> 01:30:34,830
Oh, that's a good block.

1354
01:30:34,970 --> 01:30:35,590
Oh.

1355
01:30:37,090 --> 01:30:37,610
Oh.

1356
01:30:39,810 --> 01:30:40,590
Nice try.

1357
01:30:40,850 --> 01:30:41,130
Nice try.

1358
01:30:41,330 --> 01:30:41,750
It's alright.

1359
01:30:41,910 --> 01:30:43,210
I had my moment in the beginning.

1360
01:30:45,130 --> 01:30:48,470
I grabbed two rounds off a 110 hour SK.

1361
01:30:49,090 --> 01:30:49,210
Yeah.

1362
01:30:49,750 --> 01:30:50,270
Two rounds?

1363
01:30:50,490 --> 01:30:51,010
Not bad.

1364
01:30:51,250 --> 01:30:51,550
Not bad.

1365
01:30:52,150 --> 01:30:55,730
I think once we just teach you mids, like, to counteract the
duck, it's easy.

1366
01:30:56,170 --> 01:30:58,970
I think once you play 100 more hours, you're gonna be good.

1367
01:30:58,970 --> 01:31:00,510
Yeah, I just need 100 more hours.

1368
01:31:00,950 --> 01:31:01,450
I can see that.

1369
01:31:01,710 --> 01:31:02,090
Or Friday.

1370
01:31:02,450 --> 01:31:04,390
100 more hours of game before Friday.

1371

All right.

1378
01:31:52,790 --> 01:31:53,770

01:32:03,690 --> 01:32:05,070
Dude, we ran into Raidits yesterday.

1388
01:32:05,350 --> 01:32:05,690
We have data.

1389
01:32:05,890 --> 01:32:06,410
We have data.

1390
01:32:07,650 --> 01:32:08,030
Oh, yeah.

1391
01:32:08,090 --> 01:32:09,070

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1393
01:32:11,530 --> 01:32:11,850
Hey.

1394
01:32:12,190 --> 01:32:17,850
i'm so down i did it because i thought i thought i was
fighting raiders i was ready to go get ready for the next

1395
01:32:17,850 --> 01:32:24,590

learn on the fly i believe

1396
01:32:32,860 --> 01:32:34,080
good side stuff

1397
01:32:37,540 --> 01:32:44,460
all right we're just backing up a lot this is grabs oh we're
doing that until they do they're probably getting active

1398
01:32:44,460 --> 01:32:46,460
coaching about it though Yeah.

1399
01:32:48,540 --> 01:32:50,760
Nice block, Kony.

1400
01:32:53,560 --> 01:32:54,780
How am I delayed?

1401
01:32:59,740 --> 01:33:01,180
Three points!

1402
01:33:02,640 --> 01:33:04,680
Yeah, last night with the rank.

1403
01:33:05,900 --> 01:33:07,240
Three points, distributor.

1404
01:33:08,500 --> 01:33:08,720
Ooh.

1405
01:33:10,620 --> 01:33:12,720
We're just cleaning up Azusena Nation here.

1406
01:33:13,080 --> 01:33:15,180
What the fuck was that?

1407
01:33:16,340 --> 01:33:18,100
Oh my, that was a good break.

1408
01:33:19,800 --> 01:33:19,880
Oh.

1409
01:33:22,660 --> 01:33:25,940
Oh, I'm like five seconds behind you guys.

1410
01:33:26,940 --> 01:33:27,800
Is that a wall coach?

1411
01:33:29,080 --> 01:33:30,820
Bro, don't do that, bro.

1412
01:33:31,360 --> 01:33:32,720
Is that a wall coach?

1413
01:33:33,880 --> 01:33:35,680
I think it might be.

1414
01:33:36,100 --> 01:33:37,760
I think that might be a combo.

1415
01:33:38,060 --> 01:33:39,040
Oh my God.

1416
01:33:40,520 --> 01:33:41,580
Oh my God.

1417
01:33:41,840 --> 01:33:44,000
Chat, I'll be able to do that in three days.

1418
01:33:44,240 --> 01:33:45,280
Stop breaking ones, bro.

1419
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:47,100
I hope they coach is talking.

1420
01:33:48,580 --> 01:33:49,220
It's dress.

1421
01:33:52,340 --> 01:33:53,420
Oh, now it's ones.

1422
01:33:53,720 --> 01:33:54,680
Okay, we only break ones.

1423
01:33:55,920 --> 01:33:57,600
Might just be mashing the one-one move.

1424
01:33:57,660 --> 01:33:58,520
That move right there.

1425
01:33:58,740 --> 01:34:00,500
Yeah, because it's doing the counter hit sound.

1426
01:34:00,700 --> 01:34:01,540
So she's just messing with one.

1427
01:34:02,100 --> 01:34:05,300
Oh, such a smart decision from a smart player named Kony.

1428
01:34:05,660 --> 01:34:06,440
Oh, my God.

1429
01:34:06,520 --> 01:34:07,340
Who is he?

1430
01:34:07,740 --> 01:34:09,840
Knee into any other grab that isn't one.

1431
01:34:10,140 --> 01:34:11,120
And I mean, you take it easy.

1432
01:34:11,320 --> 01:34:11,860
3-0 as well.

1433
01:34:12,040 --> 01:34:12,360
Yeah, yeah.

1434
01:34:12,460 --> 01:34:13,600
Let's just keep going twos.

1435
01:34:14,080 --> 01:34:14,620
Yeah, just do two.

1436
01:34:16,320 --> 01:34:27,460

1439
01:34:43,420 --> 01:34:48,920

back three i think i would have beat him because like he's

1440
01:34:48,920 --> 01:34:57,340
just he's just mashing so i don't know how good bears uh uh
power crushes are it's pretty good so don't like spam it

1441
01:34:57,340 --> 01:35:04,920

yeah yeah all right we go find me he does a three hit over

1442
01:35:04,920 --> 01:35:11,560
and over it's like a kick then a punch and then uh another
punch it's like back four two one oh never mind i am playing

Never mind.

1448
01:35:19,480 --> 01:35:20,680
Avoid everything.

1449
01:35:21,580 --> 01:35:22,300
Crashing this boat.

1450
01:35:22,840 --> 01:35:23,800
He's realizing.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.

1469
01:36:24,620 --> 01:36:26,380
But level two is so fake though.

1470
01:36:26,900 --> 01:36:28,220
And then you go to brand destroy.

1471
01:36:28,280 --> 01:36:29,180

01:40:03,560 --> 01:40:05,080
Wow, nice pairing.

1502
01:40:05,640 --> 01:40:05,740

01:40:34,620 --> 01:40:34,940
You can block.

1512
01:40:35,240 --> 01:40:36,100
Oh, no, you can't.

1513
01:40:36,420 --> 01:40:38,260

Dude, I'm gonna lose my mind.

01:41:54,040 --> 01:41:54,820
That's so close.

1529
01:41:54,860 --> 01:41:56,260
I hate this fucking character.

1530
01:41:59,660 --> 01:42:01,160
I tried to go for the lane.

1531
01:42:01,440 --> 01:42:01,940
He's smart.

1532
01:42:02,340 --> 01:42:03,560
I could have a better mix up off that.

1533
01:42:04,160 --> 01:42:05,140
What the fuck is that?

1534
01:42:06,380 --> 01:42:07,660
That's to stop you from mashing.

1535
01:42:09,120 --> 01:42:11,400
Even though what he did was unsafe.

1536
01:42:13,600 --> 01:42:14,380
I didn't even do that.

1537
01:42:16,540 --> 01:42:18,080
So he's confused too.

1538
01:42:27,340 --> 01:42:27,740
Nice.

1539
01:42:30,640 --> 01:42:31,600

Nice, good shit.

Little touches.

1544
01:42:36,060 --> 01:42:37,020
So close.

1545
01:42:39,480 --> 01:42:40,440
Good shit.

1546
01:42:40,860 --> 01:42:41,840
I had a comeback.

1547
01:42:42,200 --> 01:42:42,420
Nice, dude.

1548
01:42:42,540 --> 01:42:42,920
He's good.

1549
01:42:44,140 --> 01:42:45,600
So he's showing all his cards now.

1550
01:42:45,800 --> 01:42:47,060
We know how he plays now.

1551
01:43:03,150 --> 01:43:04,370
Get the fuck up.

1552
01:43:04,410 --> 01:43:05,990
Why can't I fucking get up, dude?

1553
01:43:06,790 --> 01:43:07,050
Oh.

1554
01:43:07,190 --> 01:43:08,130
Round four.

1555
01:43:09,110 --> 01:43:09,590
Fight.

1556
01:43:37,200 --> 01:43:38,800
I was blocking low too.

1557
01:43:38,900 --> 01:43:39,200
I did a one.

1558
01:43:39,320 --> 01:43:40,020
Yeah, I saw it.

1559
01:43:40,120 --> 01:43:40,440
You knew.

1560
01:43:40,720 --> 01:43:42,540
What a miserable character to play against.

1561
01:43:42,720 --> 01:43:43,500
Yeah, thanks.

1562
01:43:44,120 --> 01:43:45,300
It was just nothing.

1563
01:43:47,560 --> 01:43:49,280
That's a good-ass player, though.

1564
01:43:49,400 --> 01:43:50,240
He's just a good player.

1565
01:43:50,620 --> 01:43:52,440
Yeah, he knows a matchup.

1566
01:43:52,460 --> 01:43:53,760
We'll work on.

1567
01:43:53,900 --> 01:43:54,200
That's all.

1568
01:43:55,960 --> 01:43:58,200
Yeah, we'll go over that whole matchup, dude.

1569
01:43:59,380 --> 01:44:00,460
Oh, you're right, though.

1570
01:44:00,480 --> 01:44:01,220
That did look miserable.

1571

either character.

1578
01:45:03,380 --> 01:45:05,380
He's about to play his theme song.

1579
01:45:06,280 --> 01:45:09,300
Round one.

1580
01:45:13,600 --> 01:45:14,100
Fight.

1581
01:45:14,860 --> 01:45:15,800
Oh my god.

1582
01:45:17,780 --> 01:45:18,820
Fuck, I didn't get it.

1583
01:45:19,280 --> 01:45:20,880
You don't need prepped.

1584
01:45:20,960 --> 01:45:21,460
Look at you.

1585
01:45:22,840 --> 01:45:24,420
Cyborg Eddie is so funny.

1586
01:45:25,920 --> 01:45:26,640
It's like trying.

1587
01:45:27,660 --> 01:45:28,720
What a punch.

1588
01:45:29,880 --> 01:45:32,460
Getty would be like a Metal Gear boss, right?

1589
01:45:32,760 --> 01:45:33,220
Yeah, right.

1590
01:45:34,560 --> 01:45:36,240
Dancing cat, like...

1591
01:45:36,240 --> 01:45:37,020
That's your name.

1592
01:45:37,480 --> 01:45:37,940
Fight!

1593
01:45:38,460 --> 01:45:38,920
Escapade!

1594
01:45:44,840 --> 01:45:47,260
Okay, that's fair.

1595
01:45:49,420 --> 01:45:50,960
I thought you said I get that 4-2 there!

1596
01:45:51,800 --> 01:45:52,520
You can.

1597
01:45:52,980 --> 01:45:53,640
I tried.

1598
01:45:53,720 --> 01:45:54,380
Gross dancing.

1599
01:45:54,780 --> 01:45:57,740
It feels kind of laggy, and I've never complained about lag
before, isn't it?

1600
01:45:58,580 --> 01:45:59,500
Round 3.

1601
01:45:59,660 --> 01:46:00,640
Secretly on Wi-Fi?

1602
01:46:01,160 --> 01:46:01,800
There's a foul on Wi-Fi.

1603
01:46:01,820 --> 01:46:08,060
holding up the snouts that's what don't he had the wire
connection going to a wireless router

1604
01:46:11,140 --> 01:46:20,400
he just unplugged the ethernet cable is it after the dive
where he tries to take his plus 8 where I can die for it too

1605
01:46:20,900 --> 01:46:26,840
after down 4 it's just a fake out move I'll show you when he
does it I'll mention it

1606
01:46:31,680 --> 01:46:36,460
high slash oh Why is it lagging?

1607
01:46:37,660 --> 01:46:38,340
I don't know.

1608
01:46:39,760 --> 01:46:40,800
Maybe it's because he's on console.

1609
01:46:43,280 --> 01:46:45,460
I swear, dude.

1610
01:46:46,700 --> 01:46:46,940
Okay.

1611
01:46:48,660 --> 01:46:50,340
He's in the Elvenio like shit though.

1612
01:46:52,260 --> 01:46:54,040
Oh yeah, it's airborne shit.

1613
01:47:00,430 --> 01:47:00,530
Oh.

1614
01:47:02,650 --> 01:47:03,130
Nice.

1615
01:47:03,450 --> 01:47:04,150
Good shit!

1616
01:47:04,650 --> 01:47:05,970
Nice aggression, man.

1617
01:47:22,050 --> 01:47:23,230
I need a labbit.

1618
01:47:23,550 --> 01:47:24,150
Why is this a ledge?

1619
01:47:25,150 --> 01:47:26,990
Is it like it's slow-mo for you guys?

1620
01:47:27,150 --> 01:47:27,790
Yeah, it is.

1621
01:47:27,790 --> 01:47:29,810
Yeah, it is a little, yeah.

1622
01:47:30,930 --> 01:47:31,170
Ooh.

1623
01:47:31,450 --> 01:47:34,090
All right, lock in, lock in.

1624
01:47:36,010 --> 01:47:37,390
Oops, I didn't mean to do that.

1625
01:47:38,610 --> 01:47:40,450
Yeah, it does look a little...

1626
01:47:40,450 --> 01:47:41,590
It is, yeah.

1627
01:47:44,170 --> 01:47:44,990
That's strange.

1628
01:47:45,130 --> 01:47:47,310
Bro bursted out the lag switch.

1629
01:47:49,490 --> 01:47:50,850
It feels chunky.

1630
01:47:51,190 --> 01:47:52,190
I don't like it.

1631
01:47:53,990 --> 01:47:55,890
So won't bit the Ethernet cable.

1632
01:48:00,160 --> 01:48:02,000
Whoops, I messed up one of them.

1633
01:48:04,380 --> 01:48:04,900
Nice.

1634
01:48:06,700 --> 01:48:07,740
Launch him.

1635
01:48:09,670 --> 01:48:10,510
Oh, nice.

1636
01:48:13,470 --> 01:48:16,730
That combo makes me so anxious because it looks like a shit
hit.

1637
01:48:17,890 --> 01:48:20,550
I did not mean to throw out of there.

1638
01:48:21,030 --> 01:48:22,530
His throw breaks are pretty weak though.

1639
01:48:38,420 --> 01:48:39,300
Good shit.

1640
01:48:39,660 --> 01:48:40,220
I'm sputnik.

1641
01:48:43,640 --> 01:48:44,640
I'm okay with this.

1642
01:48:45,940 --> 01:48:47,280
You do kind of deserve it.

1643
01:48:47,440 --> 01:48:48,520
You do kind of deserve it.

1644
01:48:48,640 --> 01:48:49,380
I'm okay with this.

1645
01:48:50,200 --> 01:48:51,700
Oh, are you still okay with it?

1646
01:48:52,040 --> 01:48:53,200
Are you still okay?

1647
01:48:54,200 --> 01:48:55,160
Are you still okay?

1648
01:48:56,960 --> 01:48:57,140
What?

1649
01:48:58,600 --> 01:49:00,180
It's like an Elden Ring boss.

1650
01:49:00,400 --> 01:49:00,680
Why did that?

1651
01:49:02,080 --> 01:49:02,520
Shrack.

1652
01:49:05,760 --> 01:49:08,320
Bro, they keep more guns.

1653
01:49:12,080 --> 01:49:12,300
Nice.

1654
01:49:13,040 --> 01:49:13,800
Right in the penis.

1655
01:49:14,280 --> 01:49:15,740
It's just, did this controller DC?

1656
01:49:16,100 --> 01:49:16,600
I don't know.

1657
01:49:16,860 --> 01:49:17,520
We take those.

1658
01:49:17,640 --> 01:49:18,700
This is such a weird fucking...

1659
01:49:18,700 --> 01:49:19,020
Yeah, you did.

1660
01:49:19,380 --> 01:49:20,460
I'm taking it.

1661
01:49:20,480 --> 01:49:20,600
I'm taking it.

1662
01:49:20,600 --> 01:49:21,100
I'm taking it, bro!

1663
01:49:22,340 --> 01:49:24,020
There's no fair fight attacking!

1664
01:49:24,700 --> 01:49:25,080
Oh, wait, no!

1665
01:49:25,300 --> 01:49:25,660
He's up!

1666
01:49:25,920 --> 01:49:26,520
He's like...

1667
01:49:26,520 --> 01:49:26,580
No!

1668
01:49:26,960 --> 01:49:28,120
He plugged it back in!

1669
01:49:28,140 --> 01:49:28,840
He plugged it in!

1670
01:49:31,560 --> 01:50:04,140

Nice grab.

1674
01:50:34,510 --> 01:50:34,870
That was good.

1675
01:50:35,810 --> 01:50:36,510
Bro's got kicks.

1676
01:50:40,490 --> 01:50:41,690
There's probably one more.

1677
01:50:42,110 --> 01:50:42,650
You're crazy.

1678
01:50:43,090 --> 01:50:44,670
That was a crazy move to start.

1679
01:50:46,230 --> 01:50:46,610
Yeah.

1680
01:50:47,310 --> 01:50:48,530
Doki knows too.

1681
01:50:48,770 --> 01:50:51,510
Yeah, if I knew that, he then it's bad.

1682
01:50:56,260 --> 01:50:57,980
Just watch the sweep.

1683
01:51:03,750 --> 01:51:06,830
Yeah, he's He's sweeping like crazy dude.

1684
01:51:08,030 --> 01:51:08,630
Just sit and wait.

1685
01:51:09,170 --> 01:51:11,170
Cash out.

1686
01:51:17,550 --> 01:51:18,750
Why the fuck?

1687
01:51:24,740 --> 01:51:25,340
I don't know Eddie.

1688
01:51:25,340 --> 01:51:25,580
I don't get it.

1689
01:51:25,600 --> 01:51:25,860
I don't know.

1690
01:51:26,760 --> 01:51:28,880
Eddie, I don't know Eddie.

1691
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:29,180
I don't know.

1692
01:51:29,280 --> 01:51:29,520
I don't know.

1693
01:51:30,320 --> 01:51:32,240
He's just spinning around.

1694
01:51:32,680 --> 01:51:33,260
I don't know Eddie.

1695
01:51:33,380 --> 01:51:33,780
I don't know Eddie.

1696
01:51:33,940 --> 01:51:34,940
I literally don't know Eddie.

1697
01:51:35,240 --> 01:51:36,440
Fucking ready to rip.

1698
01:51:38,380 --> 01:51:39,800
He should have a dizzy meter.

1699
01:51:39,840 --> 01:51:41,220
Dude, I've never seen this before.

1700
01:51:41,840 --> 01:51:44,280
He should have a dizzy meter and if it fills up, he vomits.

1701
01:51:45,360 --> 01:51:46,900
Somebody stop this man.

1702
01:51:47,860 --> 01:51:48,940
Nobody can do this for real.

1703
01:51:49,040 --> 01:51:50,020
No human alive.

1704
01:51:51,160 --> 01:51:51,840
What a launch.

1705
01:51:52,320 --> 01:51:53,860
A dizzy meter, bro, that's incredible.

1706
01:51:55,820 --> 01:51:58,060
Just bring back all the stamina bar.

1707
01:51:58,080 --> 01:52:00,880
If it fills, he has a 360 frame vomiting animation.

1708
01:52:02,460 --> 01:52:05,060
Bring back the stamina bar at this point as well.

1709
01:52:08,600 --> 01:52:09,720
Yeah, he's tired.

1710
01:52:10,320 --> 01:52:11,260
He's tired.

1711
01:52:11,600 --> 01:52:12,580
He needs some rest.

1712
01:52:13,880 --> 01:52:15,780
He breathes like Mario when he has red health.

1713
01:52:15,900 --> 01:52:17,760
It's like, whoo, whoo, whoo.

1714
01:52:23,850 --> 01:52:25,370
I've been lied to by my coach.

1715
01:52:25,850 --> 01:52:26,410
Dude, what?

1716
01:52:26,610 --> 01:52:27,690
You guys have gone wrong.

1717
01:52:29,090 --> 01:52:29,930
No, I've been like that.

1718
01:52:30,570 --> 01:52:31,890
It's our coach's fault.

1719
01:52:32,410 --> 01:52:33,030
You're dead.

1720
01:52:34,890 --> 01:52:37,070
He's been paid off by Big FDX.

How many more rounds?

1903
02:05:41,730 --> 02:05:42,590
I think we have...

1904
02:05:42,590 --> 02:05:44,190
I think we're fighting...

1905
02:05:44,190 --> 02:05:45,590
We're fighting every team.

1906
02:05:45,870 --> 02:05:46,970
And there's six teams in total.

1907
02:05:48,310 --> 02:05:49,270
So, uh...

1908
02:05:49,270 --> 02:05:49,870
Watch this.

1909
02:05:53,090 --> 02:05:53,570
Sorry.

1910
02:05:53,970 --> 02:05:55,490
This is literally my favorite move.

1911
02:05:59,690 --> 02:06:01,890
Oh god, oh god, please, I'm sorry.

1912
02:06:02,510 --> 02:06:03,970
I'm so sorry, I'll never do that again.

1913
02:06:04,130 --> 02:06:04,970
I'm so sorry.

1914
02:06:05,910 --> 02:06:06,810
I'm so sorry.

1915
02:06:08,790 --> 02:06:09,670
JK, I'm not sorry.

1916
02:06:10,090 --> 02:06:10,590
Do not duck!

1917
02:06:12,950 --> 02:06:13,830
Watch this.

1918
02:06:20,410 --> 02:06:23,670
That's literally the only thing I know how to do.

1919
02:06:24,890 --> 02:06:26,690
JK, I also know...

1920
02:06:26,690 --> 02:06:28,250
Oh wait, I know how to do this.

1921
02:06:28,430 --> 02:06:29,190
But do you think she learned?

1922
02:06:29,490 --> 02:06:31,690
No, they never learn.

1923
02:06:32,090 --> 02:06:33,410
That's why I like doing it.

1924
02:06:34,510 --> 02:06:36,450
Because they don't learn.

1925
02:06:38,550 --> 02:06:39,450
There you go.

1926
02:06:42,850 --> 02:06:43,890
They never learn.

1927
02:06:46,490 --> 02:06:47,010
Nope.

1928
02:06:51,120 --> 02:06:52,400
Okay, I messed that up though.

1929
02:06:55,720 --> 02:06:56,720
They never expect it.

1930
02:06:56,840 --> 02:06:58,220
Why don't they... I don't understand.

1931
02:06:58,420 --> 02:06:59,620
They should expect it.

1932
02:07:00,860 --> 02:07:02,980
Like, it's such a good move.

1933
02:07:05,540 --> 02:07:06,620
Oh, alright.

1934
02:07:06,880 --> 02:07:07,160

Can she dodge this?

1949
02:08:41,470 --> 02:08:41,590
No.

1950
02:08:41,690 --> 02:08:42,770
Oh, she can!

1951
02:08:43,070 --> 02:08:43,990

02:08:59,370 --> 02:09:00,310
I'm so sorry.

1959
02:09:03,810 --> 02:09:06,470
They never expect it twice.

1960
02:09:07,530 --> 02:09:09,130
Okay, but does she expect again?

1961
02:09:09,370 --> 02:09:10,210
Oh, wait, she did.

1962
02:09:11,210 --> 02:09:12,970
Okay, but do you think she'll expect it again?

1963
02:09:13,130 --> 02:09:14,410
Oh, she just swings, yes.

1964
02:09:15,010 --> 02:09:16,450
Okay, I should stop trolling now.

1965
02:09:16,910 --> 02:09:17,290
For real.

1966
02:09:18,390 --> 02:09:19,630
Okay, for real this time.

1967
02:09:19,990 --> 02:09:20,370
For real.

1968
02:09:23,650 --> 02:09:25,610
Let's do that move, Doki.

1969
02:09:27,750 --> 02:09:28,630
Oh, man.

1970
02:09:28,750 --> 02:09:33,070
I want to do this move that my coach keeps telling me to do,
but I can never pull it off.

1971
02:09:33,090 --> 02:09:34,350
in a real fucking game.

1972
02:09:35,030 --> 02:09:36,090
Because it's so difficult.

1973
02:09:38,630 --> 02:09:38,870
Please.

1974
02:09:39,130 --> 02:09:39,410

02:09:39,490 --> 02:09:39,750
Please.

1976
02:09:39,890 --> 02:09:43,470
I really want to do the move that my coach wanted me to do.

1977
02:09:48,650 --> 02:09:49,130
Please.

1978
02:09:49,970 --> 02:09:50,970
I can block.

1979
02:09:51,650 --> 02:09:53,610
It's just that like I get impatient.

1980
02:09:56,030 --> 02:09:56,290
All right.

1981
02:09:56,430 --> 02:09:57,130
Watch me block.

1982
02:09:57,350 --> 02:09:57,410
Okay.

1983
02:09:57,470 --> 02:09:58,650
You guys think I can't block.

1984
02:09:58,830 --> 02:09:59,190
Watch this.

1985
02:09:59,450 --> 02:10:01,450
Wait, this person has 13 wins in a row.

1986
02:10:01,670 --> 02:10:04,150

I muted the wrong thing.

He just ducks and launches me?

02:11:26,510 --> 02:11:27,130
No way.

2013
02:11:27,750 --> 02:11:28,590
Can I keep doing this?

2014
02:11:28,890 --> 02:11:28,950
That sucks.

2015
02:11:29,090 --> 02:11:30,830
And I'm going to leave and he's going to be furious.

2016
02:11:31,950 --> 02:11:32,930
I feel really bad.

2017
02:11:33,450 --> 02:11:33,790
Okay.

2018
02:11:34,190 --> 02:11:34,970
This guy's good.

2019
02:11:35,130 --> 02:11:36,990
and I'm just one and donening him after I win.

2020
02:11:37,910 --> 02:11:38,250
Yeah.

2021
02:11:38,910 --> 02:11:41,110
He did promo off me, though, so...

Okay.

2023
02:11:42,710 --> 02:11:44,070

Okay.

2027
02:11:48,630 --> 02:11:51,850
I fought a drag who was very good and cleaned me up first
round.

2028
02:11:52,570 --> 02:11:55,650
And then I beat him second game up by left because we had to
get in this lobby.

2029
02:11:56,450 --> 02:11:57,570
Oh, I feel bad.

Okay.

02:12:00,110 --> 02:12:02,170
If that guy comes in here, I'm going to apologize.

2035
02:12:04,550 --> 02:12:04,930
All right.

2036
02:12:05,330 --> 02:12:06,350

2037
02:12:06,590 --> 02:12:07,330
Where the fuck is it?

2038
02:12:07,510 --> 02:12:08,690
Oh, there you go.

2039
02:12:08,930 --> 02:12:09,350
Oh, my God.

2040
02:12:09,570 --> 02:12:10,010
Which guy?

2041
02:12:10,230 --> 02:12:10,510
Which guy?

2042
02:12:10,590 --> 02:12:11,290
He is savvy.

2043
02:12:11,310 --> 02:12:11,770
Oh, fuck.

2044
02:12:12,130 --> 02:12:12,130
Okay.

2045
02:12:12,230 --> 02:12:13,070
He was very good.

2046
02:12:13,370 --> 02:12:15,330
He slapped me first round.

2047
02:12:15,770 --> 02:12:17,410
And second round, I beat him and I had to leave.

2048
02:12:18,870 --> 02:12:21,070
So, I just got my win and then left.

2049
02:12:21,570 --> 02:12:22,750
He thinks you ran.

2050
02:12:23,390 --> 02:12:25,310
Yeah, he thinks I'm... I feel bad, bro.

2051
02:12:25,390 --> 02:12:25,810
My bad.

2052
02:12:26,310 --> 02:12:27,330
Oh, there's a passcode.

2053
02:12:27,550 --> 02:12:28,050
Excellent leak.

2054
02:12:28,330 --> 02:12:28,510
Listen.

2055
02:12:29,210 --> 02:12:30,350
Nobody's coming in here, right?

2056
02:12:30,570 --> 02:12:31,090
We're good.

2057
02:12:32,790 --> 02:12:37,550
If that guy comes in here, his name was germ i think hey if

2060
02:13:07,630 --> 02:13:10,550
Maybe you guys should change your name to Doki as well.

2061
02:13:12,030 --> 02:13:13,070
Free publicity.

2062
02:13:13,490 --> 02:13:13,670
Okay.

2063
02:13:13,870 --> 02:13:14,230

Why?

2070
02:13:32,610 --> 02:13:32,890
No.

2071
02:13:33,090 --> 02:13:34,990

02:14:11,200 --> 02:14:12,180
I hate martial law.

2077
02:14:12,620 --> 02:14:15,300
I'm sorry I hit you, just let me get up.

2078
02:14:17,320 --> 02:14:18,520
Cook this man.

2079
02:14:18,680 --> 02:14:22,400
Martial law hates rich people, you know, so.

2080
02:14:23,060 --> 02:14:23,840
I'm gonna do that.

2081
02:14:24,320 --> 02:14:27,140
Oh god.

2082
02:14:27,960 --> 02:14:30,520
Can I get up in time?

2083
02:14:30,840 --> 02:14:30,860
No.

2084
02:14:33,340 --> 02:14:35,260
This kill is on.

2085
02:14:36,160 --> 02:14:36,680
No.

2086
02:14:38,380 --> 02:14:38,900
Wow.

2087
02:14:39,300 --> 02:14:40,220
Wait, I'm alive.

2088
02:14:41,120 --> 02:14:41,340
Okay.

2089
02:14:46,260 --> 02:14:49,140
It was nice being alive for a second.

2090
02:14:53,260 --> 02:14:54,540
Wait, I'm lost.

2091
02:14:54,800 --> 02:14:55,420
Are we stage two?

2092
02:14:56,880 --> 02:14:57,340
Wait, what?

2093
02:14:57,540 --> 02:14:58,180
Yeah, we are.

2094
02:14:58,380 --> 02:14:59,680
We started the game.

2095
02:15:01,160 --> 02:15:02,120
Yeah, Duggy's in her match.

2096
02:15:02,220 --> 02:15:04,560
Yeah, I'm really in my match right now.

2097
02:15:04,660 --> 02:15:05,940
And martial law is unfortunately cooking.

2098
02:15:08,040 --> 02:15:09,080
Oh my god.

2099
02:15:09,300 --> 02:15:17,960
he is definitely cooking okay he's all doable he's like
three ranks above me uh i think it's more

2100
02:15:22,460 --> 02:15:35,420
it's okay i could catch up oh that's right i told you i
could catch up i could get to red rank in less hours i

2101
02:15:35,420 --> 02:15:40,580
believe actually we'll do that you know what yeah you know
I'm gonna do it.

2102
02:15:42,840 --> 02:15:48,880
I'm giving them a false sense of security in round robin 1
and I'm gonna roll up in red rank round robin 2.

2103
02:15:50,140 --> 02:15:50,840
Wait, I'm alive.

2104
02:15:51,600 --> 02:15:52,280
He's gonna slide again.

2105
02:15:54,560 --> 02:15:59,480
We got a download from the first round.

2106
02:16:00,080 --> 02:16:02,480
Like slime is doing, we gotta do that.

2107
02:16:05,520 --> 02:16:06,160
That's it.

2108
02:16:06,300 --> 02:16:09,100
In the second set, I'll remember that.

2109
02:16:09,740 --> 02:16:11,580
It's because I'm not in my costume.

2110
02:16:12,540 --> 02:16:13,240
I'm getting distracted.

2111
02:16:14,540 --> 02:16:15,100
Yeah, exactly.

2112
02:16:16,080 --> 02:16:17,660
I mean, it's a real thing.

2113
02:16:18,580 --> 02:16:19,820
King's boots are so shiny.

2114
02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:20,500
I just noticed.

2115
02:16:22,640 --> 02:16:23,640
Oh my god.

2116
02:16:30,950 --> 02:16:32,850
They have some nerd ESAM.

2117
02:16:33,870 --> 02:16:35,370
8,000 hours.

2118
02:16:36,630 --> 02:16:38,530
Ooh, some of us have lives.

2119
02:16:38,990 --> 02:16:42,130
Yeah, some of us have other stuff to do.

2120
02:16:43,150 --> 02:16:43,930
But it's okay.

2121
02:16:44,510 --> 02:16:45,710
delayed that.

2122
02:16:45,930 --> 02:16:49,570
The best if this video game is like so important for you,
that's fine.

2123
02:16:52,170 --> 02:16:52,730
Okay.

2124
02:16:53,110 --> 02:16:54,670
You must really want to go to Evo.

2125
02:16:56,190 --> 02:16:58,510
I can pay for my own ticket.

2126
02:17:03,650 --> 02:17:04,210
Yeah.

2127
02:17:04,510 --> 02:17:05,670
All of us already want a trip.

2128
02:17:06,510 --> 02:17:08,110
Doki is a multi-billionaire.

2129
02:17:09,050 --> 02:17:09,610
Yeah.

2130
02:17:09,990 --> 02:17:10,650
Fuck again.

2131
02:17:10,890 --> 02:17:12,990
The shit is nothing to me, man.

2132
02:17:12,990 --> 02:17:13,710
I don't know what I'm doing anymore.

2133
02:17:15,810 --> 02:17:18,130
No, don't make me laugh!

2134
02:17:25,050 --> 02:17:28,630
Oh my god, please.

2135
02:17:29,910 --> 02:17:31,550
Please, my coach made me laugh.

2136
02:17:34,010 --> 02:17:35,550
Did that bounce?

2137
02:17:36,490 --> 02:17:36,910
Let's go.

2138
02:17:37,210 --> 02:17:37,650
That's true.

2139
02:17:37,770 --> 02:17:39,170
I bet nobody's laughing over there.

2140
02:17:39,270 --> 02:17:41,490
That should sound like a funeral.

2141
02:17:41,930 --> 02:17:43,470
Like, let's be real here.

2142
02:17:43,830 --> 02:17:44,490
What are the real stories?

2143
02:17:44,510 --> 02:17:51,230

Kill it for fun!

2150
02:18:20,850 --> 02:18:22,510
Oh shit, that was my bad.

2151
02:18:25,230 --> 02:18:25,710
Oosh!

2152
02:18:27,250 --> 02:18:27,470
Oops.

2153
02:18:28,610 --> 02:18:31,310
My hands always go on to the wrong position sometimes.

2154
02:18:32,450 --> 02:18:33,090
Nice call out.

2155
02:18:33,230 --> 02:18:33,510
Yeah.

2156
02:18:34,390 --> 02:18:34,770
Yes!

2157
02:18:34,930 --> 02:18:35,970
See, I'm learning!

2158
02:18:36,190 --> 02:18:37,950
I had a feeling because he kept ducking!

2159
02:18:38,930 --> 02:18:40,290
He's a duck lord, yeah.

2160
02:18:40,830 --> 02:18:41,750
Learning experience right here.

2161
02:18:42,010 --> 02:18:42,290
See?

2162
02:18:42,570 --> 02:18:43,710
I knew I can learn!

2163
02:18:44,850 --> 02:18:45,670
Break his arm!

2164
02:18:46,870 --> 02:18:47,690
Break his arm!

2165
02:18:47,830 --> 02:18:48,510
He can't afford insurance!

2166
02:18:50,710 --> 02:18:51,230
That's true!

2167
02:18:51,310 --> 02:18:51,930
He is poor!

2168
02:18:52,730 --> 02:18:53,290
Wait a minute.

2169
02:18:53,410 --> 02:18:53,770
Mix up?

2170
02:18:54,550 --> 02:18:54,850
No!

2171
02:18:57,750 --> 02:18:58,550
Nice try.

2172
02:18:59,690 --> 02:19:01,730
Be honest, Doki, did you know the mix up there?

2173
02:19:01,830 --> 02:19:03,970
Did you know, like, what to do after the...

2174
02:19:03,970 --> 02:19:04,170
Yeah!

2175
02:19:04,230 --> 02:19:06,010
Because whenever I do that throw, I don't know what to do.

2176
02:19:06,090 --> 02:19:06,670
I'm like, uh-oh.

2177
02:19:07,130 --> 02:19:07,990
We're both guessing.

2178
02:19:09,270 --> 02:19:10,890
We're both hitting a button on the controller.

2179
02:19:11,730 --> 02:19:12,930
Something would work.

2180
02:19:15,890 --> 02:19:16,610
There's a lot.

2181
02:19:17,110 --> 02:19:19,610
Whenever King does that, it's crazy.

2182
02:19:20,390 --> 02:19:21,850
You'll be molded into a killer.

2183
02:19:22,850 --> 02:19:22,850
Exactly.

2184
02:19:23,290 --> 02:19:26,450
Look, look at what a couple of hours I can do.

2185
02:19:27,070 --> 02:19:29,190
Imagine what happens if I get like 40 more hours.

2186
02:19:30,090 --> 02:19:31,290
You will absolutely make it.

2187
02:19:31,570 --> 02:19:32,430
I can, I believe.

2188
02:19:33,130 --> 02:19:34,670
With your belief, I believe.

2189
02:19:35,450 --> 02:19:37,450
And hey, you can just buy the tickets.

2190
02:19:40,130 --> 02:19:41,790
You can buy your own.

2191
02:19:41,790 --> 02:19:43,570
I want the mental warfare.

2192
02:19:46,650 --> 02:19:49,510
Imagine losing a round to a yellow.

2193
02:19:50,250 --> 02:19:50,530
Bro!

2194
02:19:52,790 --> 02:19:57,110
Someone said ASM is stone-faced right now, so they weren't
having a good time.

2195
02:19:57,930 --> 02:19:58,410
Really?

2196
02:19:59,430 --> 02:20:00,210
No way, man!

2197
02:20:00,230 --> 02:20:02,810
Joshi's bed silent and all he cares about is vibes.

2198
02:20:03,110 --> 02:20:03,990
Sure I go, I'm locking in.

2199
02:20:04,130 --> 02:20:06,910
I totally, we're winning like the content wars.

2200
02:20:08,130 --> 02:20:10,450
That's where all the views are at.

2201
02:20:11,290 --> 02:20:11,810
That's what it's all about.

2202
02:20:11,810 --> 02:20:13,550
Like we didn't even win Last Land, did we?

2203

four He's minus one after that.

2214
02:22:15,180 --> 02:22:17,860
The spinny low he's doing, just mash for it.

2215
02:22:18,480 --> 02:22:21,200
It's a mix up, but I don't think he's going to play that mix
up.

2216
02:22:24,140 --> 02:22:25,540
Oh my God, counter hit grabs.

2217

2245
02:24:16,760 --> 02:24:17,380
Yes, sir.

2246
02:24:17,720 --> 02:24:18,420
Yeah, I'll kill you.

2247
02:24:18,680 --> 02:24:19,480
He always goes low.

2248
02:24:20,980 --> 02:24:23,000
That's not gonna work on day two, but fuck it.

2249
02:24:23,760 --> 02:24:24,200
Yeah.

2250
02:24:27,660 --> 02:24:28,940
We'll run drills on that.

2251
02:24:29,640 --> 02:24:29,740
Yeah.

2252
02:24:31,500 --> 02:24:32,120
No biggie.

2253
02:24:32,280 --> 02:24:32,500
No biggie.

2254
02:24:37,070 --> 02:24:38,750
Oh, nice.

2255
02:24:38,850 --> 02:24:39,690
Did you know how to get up?

2256
02:24:40,570 --> 02:24:42,030
I know that move.

2257
02:24:45,810 --> 02:24:46,250
Yeah.

2258
02:24:48,250 --> 02:24:50,830
I knew it was low, but I didn't know how to beat it.

2259
02:24:51,270 --> 02:24:53,350
Like, I could just hop that and follow up.

2260
02:24:54,550 --> 02:24:54,810
No.

2261
02:24:55,330 --> 02:24:55,770
Fight.

2262
02:24:57,610 --> 02:24:58,970
Oh, nice, one, two.

2263
02:25:02,630 --> 02:25:04,110
Dude, he's just getting that low.

2264
02:25:04,230 --> 02:25:05,590
It's just, I can't power crush it.

2265
02:25:06,070 --> 02:25:08,850
I'm not doing anything about it, but he's doing it every
time.

2266
02:25:10,430 --> 02:25:11,990
He, like, downloaded you.

2267
02:25:12,390 --> 02:25:12,810
There you go.

2268
02:25:13,450 --> 02:25:14,890
No, he's going to take care of it.

2269
02:25:14,890 --> 02:25:15,130
He's fine.

2270
02:25:16,050 --> 02:25:16,850
Oh, God.

2271
02:25:17,530 --> 02:25:19,130
Like, I know what you want, dude.

2272
02:25:21,890 --> 02:25:23,630
I know what this fucking guy wants.

2273
02:25:23,730 --> 02:25:25,630
It's just, I have to learn how to pee to it.

2274
02:25:25,830 --> 02:25:26,050
It's annoying.

2275
02:25:27,750 --> 02:25:28,190
fight

2276
02:25:36,070 --> 02:25:42,210
i gotta stop doing that oh never mind okay why does he keep
getting hit with it some half the time it makes no sense to

2277
02:25:42,210 --> 02:25:45,970
me and he's probably just guessing that like a mix-up
instead of reaction

2278
02:25:49,750 --> 02:25:58,310
ah oh yeah okay oh okay all right it's just so much it's
just mashing dude it's just i don't do it that low so many

2279
02:25:58,310 --> 02:26:03,550
times i know i know what to do i'm just trying to hop kick
it you got it you got it yeah just i know what try and match

2280
02:26:03,550 --> 02:26:20,940
score instead if you can mentally adapt but not a big deal
yeah fight nice as we talked about thank you oh no i'll be

2281
02:26:20,940 --> 02:26:29,340
able to do that one day it's the same fucking thing every
time oh my god my controller died okay oh it's fine wake up

2284
02:26:58,640 --> 02:26:59,180
Nice.

2285
02:27:02,880 --> 02:27:03,960
Hop kick.

2286
02:27:04,560 --> 02:27:04,960
Nice.

2287
02:27:05,480 --> 02:27:06,520
No, I see it.

2288
02:27:07,920 --> 02:27:08,680
Good combo.

2289
02:27:09,260 --> 02:27:09,900
We're on the wall.

2290
02:27:11,000 --> 02:27:12,300
Take him to the other side.

2291
02:27:12,340 --> 02:27:12,940
Let's go.

2292
02:27:14,340 --> 02:27:14,780
Yes!

2293
02:27:15,880 --> 02:27:17,220
Yo, he might be dead.

2294
02:27:17,940 --> 02:27:18,900
Oh, one more hit.

2295
02:27:19,320 --> 02:27:19,600
Yeah!

2296
02:27:20,560 --> 02:27:20,800
Good job.

2297
02:27:21,980 --> 02:27:22,940
Round three.

2298
02:27:23,100 --> 02:27:24,300
Just making it close for content.

2299
02:27:25,640 --> 02:27:25,860
Fight.

2300
02:27:32,400 --> 02:27:34,180
I'm just trying to get space.

2301
02:27:35,100 --> 02:27:35,900
Oh, ducked.

2302
02:27:36,960 --> 02:27:37,340
Nice.

2303
02:27:40,680 --> 02:27:41,620
Ah, fuck, man.

2304
02:27:42,120 --> 02:27:43,800
We got to try to stay aggressive.

2305
02:27:44,420 --> 02:27:44,860
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2306
02:27:44,980 --> 02:27:45,800
More than him.

2307
02:27:46,960 --> 02:27:47,260
Good crap.

2308
02:27:54,230 --> 02:27:58,030
Okay, I didn't know what that was, so I didn't do anything
about it.

2309
02:27:58,050 --> 02:27:59,410
I was like, what the fuck is this?

2310
02:28:00,130 --> 02:28:00,550
It's okay.

2311
02:28:00,670 --> 02:28:01,290
It's hard to react to.

2312
02:28:01,390 --> 02:28:09,570
that's a yeah i will absolutely be this guy if i just learn
this dragon because like i keep trying to i know it's the

2313
02:28:09,570 --> 02:28:15,650
low every time i just keep trying to hop kick it i just need
practice yeah yeah and then that three hit string too it

2314
02:28:15,650 --> 02:28:21,630
keeps counter hitting you you could just duck and launch
them for it yeah i'll be ready also the low can't kill you

2315
02:28:21,630 --> 02:28:27,350
like most lows in this game unless they're giant reactable
ones they're just meant to annoy you and get you to duck so

2316
02:28:27,350 --> 02:28:33,370
like you're getting really frustrated about the low existing
it's like early on it's a it's okay to eat eat it right it's

2317
02:28:33,370 --> 02:28:39,290
like keeping composure sure yeah while getting a load is
more important also if you're calling it out that hard low

2318
02:28:39,290 --> 02:28:45,110
parry mix up oh true i didn't even think of that you're
right just slap him in the head about if you know if you

2319
02:28:45,110 --> 02:28:50,830
want to avoid the whole like trying to think of wall
standing for or launch probably parry you know i can beat

2320
02:28:50,830 --> 02:28:58,170
that guy i'll beat that guy i believe i know you can cloney
all right you got this you got you got this dude grudge

2321
02:28:58,170 --> 02:29:09,130
match grudge match oh god he's probably got dude he's he's
scary i'm ready bro look at that rig you got this i don't

2322
02:29:09,130 --> 02:29:14,570

2323
02:29:14,570 --> 02:29:19,510

Ribon.

2327
02:29:33,470 --> 02:29:34,150
We're in the same house.

2328
02:29:34,310 --> 02:29:35,770
See what the ping is.

2329
02:29:37,750 --> 02:29:38,290

2330
02:29:38,650 --> 02:29:39,710

2331
02:29:42,410 --> 02:29:42,470
Wow.

2332
02:29:43,150 --> 02:29:43,910
Round one.

2333
02:29:44,830 --> 02:29:45,150
Fight.

2334
02:29:46,690 --> 02:29:49,050
You can launch this Watson in one, by the way.

2335
02:29:54,670 --> 02:29:54,970
Oh.

2336
02:29:55,330 --> 02:29:56,410
Oh, it's minus 14.

2337
02:30:07,950 --> 02:30:09,010
Definitely playing different.

2338
02:30:09,090 --> 02:30:09,830
He's not doing Orbital.

2339
02:30:10,470 --> 02:30:10,910
That's fine.

2340
02:30:12,110 --> 02:30:13,690
You're learning now.

2341
02:30:14,890 --> 02:30:19,050
Fuck it.

2342
02:30:40,680 --> 02:30:45,260
So then we do the grabs and stuff and running one plus two
mixes.

2343
02:30:49,970 --> 02:30:52,650
And down back four also.

2344
02:30:57,840 --> 02:30:58,100
Oh.

2345
02:30:59,760 --> 02:31:00,480
Nice.

2346
02:31:05,520 --> 02:31:06,240
Cool.

2347
02:31:06,520 --> 02:31:06,800
Okay.

2348
02:31:06,800 --> 02:31:07,040
Okay.

2349
02:31:07,040 --> 02:31:07,680
Nice.

2350
02:31:08,180 --> 02:31:08,680
Good shit.

2351
02:31:08,760 --> 02:31:09,380
Oh, yeah!

2352
02:31:09,780 --> 02:31:10,400
Let's go!

2353
02:31:14,980 --> 02:31:18,140
He's going to start orgling now because he thinks I'm going
to do that.

2354
02:31:19,900 --> 02:31:21,820
Oh my god, the mind gains.

2355
02:31:23,460 --> 02:31:24,580
Nice breaks.

2356
02:31:25,100 --> 02:31:26,780
Oh my god, he just wasted.

2357
02:31:28,140 --> 02:31:29,540
Come on, Bear Joe!

2358
02:31:34,320 --> 02:31:34,840
Yo!

2359
02:31:35,360 --> 02:31:35,640
Oh!

2360
02:31:35,940 --> 02:31:36,920
Okay, better than nothing.

2361
02:31:37,100 --> 02:31:37,620
Let's get it.

2362
02:31:37,720 --> 02:31:38,940
The touch damage.

2363
02:31:42,160 --> 02:31:42,600
Nice.

2364
02:31:43,060 --> 02:31:43,400
Brace.

2365
02:31:46,180 --> 02:31:46,700
Oh, wow.

2366
02:31:46,800 --> 02:31:48,600
I mean, that's literally layers.

2367
02:31:49,060 --> 02:31:52,480
That's like you take a guy for five years and you just know
what he's going to do.

2368
02:31:53,060 --> 02:31:53,820
Final round.

2369
02:31:54,720 --> 02:31:54,980
Fight.

2370
02:31:55,640 --> 02:31:56,660
Oh, he's looking for it.

2371
02:31:58,300 --> 02:31:59,260
Yes, sir.

2372
02:31:59,800 --> 02:32:01,980
I guess you're over to all.

2373
02:32:02,000 --> 02:32:02,960
Oh, there it is.

2374
02:32:03,280 --> 02:32:04,300
Finally pull it out round three.

2375
02:32:04,980 --> 02:32:05,280
Last round.

2376
02:32:06,820 --> 02:32:07,920
That's what destroys me.

2377
02:32:10,200 --> 02:32:10,640
Shit.

Game three.

2441
02:38:20,680 --> 02:38:21,420
We got stuff to learn.

2442
02:38:22,360 --> 02:38:24,500
He's so fucking not good at this game.

2443
02:38:26,140 --> 02:38:27,780
You're not gonna walk in your room right now.

2444
02:38:27,920 --> 02:38:29,960
I don't know who this guy is, but fuck that man.

Oh god.

2446

That's Tekken.

2447
02:38:40,360 --> 02:38:42,520
It's alright, he showed all his cards.

2448
02:38:42,720 --> 02:38:43,180
It's okay.

2449
02:38:43,520 --> 02:38:44,840
He knows no more moves.

2450
02:38:45,720 --> 02:38:45,820
Oh.

2451
02:38:48,120 --> 02:38:48,940

Genuinely.

Or I can get 7 billion damage for no reason.

2459
02:39:37,510 --> 02:39:39,790
And then Rita got crushed and then it would be okay.

2460
02:39:39,910 --> 02:39:40,910
Don't worry about it.

2461
02:39:40,990 --> 02:39:41,350
Rita!

2462
02:39:43,250 --> 02:39:45,590

02:40:13,130 --> 02:40:15,950
Bro, is he even gonna touch him?

2474
02:40:19,110 --> 02:40:20,930
He's gonna think about this in the next round.

2475
02:40:21,230 --> 02:40:21,910
Any amount of money.

2476
02:40:26,720 --> 02:40:27,580
Stay on the ground.

2477
02:40:27,980 --> 02:40:29,320
You've gotta be fucking kidding.

02:40:29,580 --> 02:40:30,740
Holy shit.

2479
02:40:32,040 --> 02:40:32,360
That was good.

2480
02:40:33,160 --> 02:40:35,260
This was like me against Boxbox yesterday.

2481
02:40:37,720 --> 02:40:39,380
That's why he said this out.

2482
02:40:40,820 --> 02:40:41,700
God, dude.

2483
02:40:41,820 --> 02:40:43,780
It was really fast.

02:40:44,040 --> 02:40:45,440
Yeah, that was like 20 seconds.

2485
02:40:45,520 --> 02:40:46,660
Yeah, that was like 20 seconds.

2486
02:40:47,700 --> 02:40:48,880

02:40:50,820 --> 02:40:52,580
No, you already fucked with his mental.

2489
02:40:55,540 --> 02:40:57,700
Boxbox has a pretty good mental, though.

2490
02:41:00,100 --> 02:41:00,840
He's crying.

2491
02:41:01,000 --> 02:41:01,460

It's like a Twitter combo.

02:42:17,910 --> 02:42:20,150
And you can't read it because it's all in Korean.

2516
02:42:22,170 --> 02:42:23,810

Oh my god, he actually downloaded it.

2522
02:42:34,730 --> 02:42:36,130

02:50:17,530 --> 02:50:18,510
Wave dash back?

2587
02:50:18,670 --> 02:50:19,430
That kind stuff.

2588
02:50:19,530 --> 02:50:20,250
F smash?

2589
02:50:20,750 --> 02:50:21,250
Cracked.

2590
02:50:21,510 --> 02:50:22,490
He's fucking cracked.

2591
02:50:24,030 --> 02:50:25,030
F smash.

2592
02:50:25,030 --> 02:50:26,170
Fun set.

2593
02:50:26,650 --> 02:50:27,170
Good shit.

2594
02:50:27,370 --> 02:50:29,090
Let's get off this stage, bro!

2595
02:50:29,970 --> 02:50:32,790
Let me out of this way.

2596
02:50:32,890 --> 02:50:34,030
Wait, were we on stream?

2597
02:50:35,190 --> 02:50:36,130
No, we were not.

2598
02:50:36,530 --> 02:50:37,110
We were not.

2599
02:50:37,230 --> 02:50:37,750
We were on stream?

2600
02:50:37,750 --> 02:50:37,930
We were last round.

2601
02:50:38,430 --> 02:50:39,730
I think stage one is stream.

2602
02:50:42,710 --> 02:50:43,210
We're stage one.

2603
02:50:43,590 --> 02:50:43,970
Nice.

2604
02:50:45,070 --> 02:50:46,010
The roll.

2605
02:50:47,610 --> 02:50:48,330
Waldemort?

2606
02:50:49,270 --> 02:50:52,010
I'll be able to do that one day.

2607
02:50:52,990 --> 02:50:53,530
Good shit.

2608
02:50:53,890 --> 02:50:55,350
Damn it.

2609
02:50:55,350 --> 02:50:56,610
Wow, that's nuts.

2610
02:51:04,690 --> 02:51:06,290
Giant is relentless.

2611
02:51:07,250 --> 02:51:08,510
Round two.

2612
02:51:10,870 --> 02:51:11,550
Nice.

2613
02:51:19,260 --> 02:51:19,980
Oh, nice.

2614
02:51:21,120 --> 02:51:21,840
All

2615
02:51:25,220 --> 02:51:26,420
right, we got a wall.

2616
02:51:34,200 --> 02:51:34,640
Nice!

2617
02:51:34,740 --> 02:51:36,060
Oh my god!

2618
02:51:36,340 --> 02:51:36,900
Good shit!

2619
02:51:37,040 --> 02:51:37,860
Where'd Blood's face go?

2620
02:51:39,780 --> 02:51:41,060
Send him to the hospital!

2621
02:51:41,080 --> 02:51:42,240
I know they're crazy under that mask.

2622
02:51:42,700 --> 02:51:44,060
He ain't got no teeth.

2623
02:51:49,720 --> 02:51:50,500
Good shit.

2624
02:51:50,720 --> 02:51:51,160
Oh nice!

2625
02:51:52,740 --> 02:51:53,180
Oh!

2626
02:52:00,910 --> 02:52:02,330
Oh my goodness.

2627
02:52:02,350 --> 02:52:03,270
That's a nice punish.

2628
02:52:03,350 --> 02:52:03,890
Love that.

2629
02:52:04,190 --> 02:52:04,870
I love that.

2630
02:52:04,870 --> 02:52:06,450
I love that when it happens in the game.

2631
02:52:09,270 --> 02:52:10,550
Oh, oh, no.

2632
02:52:11,210 --> 02:52:12,870
I mean shit, I mean shit happens, whatever.

2633
02:52:13,390 --> 02:52:14,030
No recovery of life.

2634
02:52:14,550 --> 02:52:15,370
That's alive, you know.

2635
02:52:21,240 --> 02:52:23,620
It's getting a little close.

2636
02:52:24,300 --> 02:52:24,760
Oh.

2637
02:52:27,700 --> 02:52:29,300
Oh my- I fucked up.

2638
02:52:29,460 --> 02:52:30,220
Okay, it's okay.

2639
02:52:32,900 --> 02:52:33,100
Okay.

2640
02:52:33,100 --> 02:52:33,580
Let's fucking go!

2641
02:52:36,400 --> 02:52:37,400
Oh my god, I'm gonna die.

2642
02:52:37,420 --> 02:52:38,860
He gave you two chances!

2643
02:52:40,300 --> 02:52:41,840
Oh, Brian, two times!

2644
02:52:44,700 --> 02:52:47,440
He parried it twice and let him know he could.

2645
02:52:47,900 --> 02:52:49,100
Today I will go low again.

2646
02:52:50,340 --> 02:52:52,220
It was to make a statement.

2647
02:52:52,680 --> 02:52:54,210
Surely they won't predict another low.

2648
02:52:56,540 --> 02:52:58,380
They'll never learn.

2649
02:52:58,660 --> 02:52:59,040
Nice.

2650
02:52:59,620 --> 02:53:00,180
The dokey!

2651
02:53:00,880 --> 02:53:03,700
The dokey, I love that.

2652
02:53:07,280 --> 02:53:08,540
Learnings for chumps.

2653
02:53:12,400 --> 02:53:13,300

he did the little jump it would have been wait because like

2656
02:53:28,080 --> 02:53:34,420

2672
02:55:03,380 --> 02:55:04,520
The rage are...

2673
02:55:04,520 --> 02:55:05,620
Rage are...

2674
02:55:05,620 --> 02:55:09,620
I'm gonna use the bathroom real quick while you watch this
rematches the century.

2675
02:55:10,020 --> 02:55:10,080
He is evil.

2676
02:55:10,080 --> 02:55:11,620
He is special evil with it.

2677
02:55:14,380 --> 02:55:15,360
Nice block.

2678
02:55:25,660 --> 02:55:26,060
Fight!

2679
02:55:27,540 --> 02:55:28,900
I can't believe Josh popped in.

2680
02:55:30,000 --> 02:55:31,000
Yeah, he did.

2681
02:55:31,380 --> 02:55:32,920
It was a close stat, you know?

2682
02:55:33,440 --> 02:55:35,540
I feel like he was sandbagging when I was watching.

2683
02:55:35,680 --> 02:55:36,340
I don't know, man.

2684
02:55:36,440 --> 02:55:37,440
What was up with that?

2685
02:55:38,020 --> 02:55:39,180
He finished all the combos.

2686
02:55:39,780 --> 02:55:42,180
You drop them sometimes, though, slime.

2687
02:55:42,400 --> 02:55:43,540
You're in the BNBs.

2688
02:55:44,280 --> 02:55:48,820
And also, like, let's say you do the hop kick, you'll do one
back to one in the hunting bear stance.

2689
02:55:48,900 --> 02:55:49,460
You could do two.

2690
02:55:49,680 --> 02:55:51,960
Back to one, back to one, then the bear stance.

2691
02:55:52,380 --> 02:55:53,040
Right, right.

2692
02:55:53,140 --> 02:55:53,420
Okay.

2693
02:55:53,420 --> 02:55:56,120
If I want to- Yeah, you have to- We shouldn't in the first
place.

2694
02:55:57,000 --> 02:55:57,240
Yeah.

2695
02:55:58,920 --> 02:56:00,840
We're on stage three now.

2696
02:56:02,440 --> 02:56:02,840
Oh,

2697
02:56:09,490 --> 02:56:10,370

2698
02:56:11,950 --> 02:56:12,550
Yeah, we're set.

2699
02:56:12,730 --> 02:56:13,090
Yeah, lobby.

2700
02:56:15,710 --> 02:56:16,110
Okay.

2701
02:56:16,370 --> 02:56:17,490
Matt and then take a game off Unk?

2702
02:56:19,350 --> 02:56:20,050
Oh, again.

2703
02:56:20,230 --> 02:56:21,310
Okay, I'm back.

2704
02:56:21,710 --> 02:56:22,130
Yeah, maybe.

2705
02:56:23,130 --> 02:56:24,110
My devil chain?

2706
02:56:24,190 --> 02:56:26,230
He beat my devil chain while we were coaching.

2707
02:56:29,590 --> 02:56:31,410
Oh no, but get out of my way.

2708
02:56:31,810 --> 02:56:33,250
I don't know if I want to fight me again.

2709
02:56:33,630 --> 02:56:33,950
Okay.

2710
02:56:34,090 --> 02:56:34,270
All right.

2711
02:56:34,490 --> 02:56:35,270
Sorry, I got to finish this set.

2712
02:56:35,350 --> 02:56:36,210
I don't know what's going on.

2713
02:56:36,630 --> 02:56:37,530
He wants to fight.

2714
02:56:37,590 --> 02:56:37,930
He wants to fight.

2715
02:56:38,050 --> 02:56:39,630
Let's do it.

2716
02:56:40,370 --> 02:56:41,170
Lobby's up.

2717
02:56:41,690 --> 02:56:42,470
Oh, Lobby's up?

2718
02:56:42,770 --> 02:56:43,210
Four kicks.

2719
02:56:43,870 --> 02:56:44,430
Yeah, it's up.

2720
02:56:44,730 --> 02:56:45,650
That's so fast.

2721
02:56:46,910 --> 02:56:48,910
Yeah, they're just moving through it.

2722
02:56:50,150 --> 02:56:53,790
We got two more, two more sets.

2723

Maybe I will restart my game.

2729
02:57:43,190 --> 02:57:44,470
Maybe some bronzes.

2730
02:58:02,880 --> 02:58:05,600
Not everybody's here, so we have lots of time.

2731
02:58:06,900 --> 02:58:07,080
Yeah.

2732
02:58:08,140 --> 02:58:10,640
So, Doki, how's your first Sage Jam Slam so far?

Yeah, learning.

You're like double digits.

He should be dead.

2754
02:59:40,710 --> 02:59:41,390
On the street.

2755
02:59:41,730 --> 02:59:42,390
Oh, fuck.

2756
02:59:42,690 --> 02:59:44,270
Why do I never focus on these?

2757
02:59:44,990 --> 02:59:45,910
Oh, I forgot about the hotel.

02:59:46,970 --> 02:59:47,730
How do you, for you?

2759
02:59:47,770 --> 02:59:48,550

That's really it.

2836
03:03:20,720 --> 03:03:23,280
If you don't learn, I can take advantage of it.

2837
03:03:23,540 --> 03:03:26,200
He literally stood up like R1.

2838

He did that, he did that.

Yeah, get her out of that.

3107
03:19:03,260 --> 03:19:04,760
I can't believe that works.

3108
03:19:05,240 --> 03:19:06,280
That always works.

3109
03:19:07,080 --> 03:19:07,800
They'll never learn.

3110
03:19:07,920 --> 03:19:08,960
This team doesn't learn.

3111
03:19:12,820 --> 03:19:14,060
No, one plus two.

3112
03:19:14,880 --> 03:19:15,740
One plus two.

3113
03:19:17,040 --> 03:19:17,160
Oh.

3114
03:19:18,120 --> 03:19:18,600
Nice.

3115
03:19:19,180 --> 03:19:20,480
Drop the satellite.

3116
03:19:21,600 --> 03:19:21,960
Punished?

3117
03:19:22,200 --> 03:19:22,860
Ah, sorry.

3118
03:19:23,080 --> 03:19:23,880
I didn't know it was punishable.

3119
03:19:24,960 --> 03:19:25,980
Oh, it hits still.

3120
03:19:26,440 --> 03:19:27,560
Oh, is that?

3121
03:19:27,860 --> 03:19:28,780
Oh, my God.

3122
03:19:29,320 --> 03:19:30,340
Now you know why I was confused.

3123
03:19:31,040 --> 03:19:31,280
Yeah.

3124
03:19:32,380 --> 03:19:34,560
I can tell that Kony is way behind.

3125
03:19:35,280 --> 03:19:36,120
I'm very behind.

3126
03:19:36,280 --> 03:19:37,680
You know, I think it's the state.

3127
03:19:37,760 --> 03:19:39,140
I got to restart this PC.

3128
03:19:40,820 --> 03:19:45,040
You're like drop the satellite and then we're like four
seconds ahead of you.

3129
03:19:45,860 --> 03:19:47,580
I'm watching like a John Woofield.

3130
03:19:48,600 --> 03:19:50,360
Oh, you get your HP back.

3131
03:19:50,620 --> 03:19:51,020
I know, right?

3132
03:19:51,100 --> 03:19:51,980
It's a hard counter now.

3133
03:19:52,160 --> 03:19:52,400
Genuinely.

3134
03:19:53,100 --> 03:19:54,040
It's good to armor, Alyssa.

3135
03:19:55,260 --> 03:19:56,580

3136
03:19:57,980 --> 03:19:58,500
Oh, fuck.

3137
03:19:58,700 --> 03:19:59,600
This is close, man.

3138
03:19:59,720 --> 03:20:00,180
I don't know Alyssa.

3139
03:20:00,400 --> 03:20:01,500
Damn, this guy's pretty good.

03:20:02,040 --> 03:20:03,460

Oh my god, she's so dead!

3149
03:21:27,250 --> 03:21:28,550
You get so much health back.

3150
03:21:29,990 --> 03:21:30,870
That's absurd.

3151
03:21:33,770 --> 03:21:34,650
Nice step.

3152
03:21:35,570 --> 03:21:36,790
Yeah, that was good.

3153
03:21:42,420 --> 03:21:43,980
Oh shit, that's launch, huh?

3154
03:21:44,200 --> 03:21:45,880
You have to stay ducking, yes.

3155
03:21:46,080 --> 03:21:46,900
You have to stay ducking.

3156
03:21:47,580 --> 03:21:48,220
Low high.

3157
03:21:48,320 --> 03:21:49,020
It jails though.

3158
03:21:50,840 --> 03:21:54,160
What if I duck the, or I get hit by the high, what happens?

3159
03:21:56,000 --> 03:21:59,160
Is it like, you know, the frames on it?

3160
03:21:59,480 --> 03:22:02,360
I don't know the frames, but it's like neutral-ish.

3161
03:22:02,680 --> 03:22:03,420
Oh, do you hit that?

3162
03:22:03,800 --> 03:22:04,200
Yeah!

3163
03:22:07,160 --> 03:22:08,240
Yeah, it is neutral.

3164
03:22:08,420 --> 03:22:09,820
It is neutral, but it does chip damage.

3165
03:22:10,940 --> 03:22:11,560
I don't know what to do here.

3166
03:22:11,580 --> 03:22:12,920
He's gonna do something random as shit.

3167
03:22:13,360 --> 03:22:13,560
I'm gonna get it.

3168
03:22:13,560 --> 03:22:14,600
You can run up and block.

3169
03:22:17,920 --> 03:22:18,220
Punish.

3170
03:22:18,480 --> 03:22:18,740
Nice!

3171
03:22:19,020 --> 03:22:19,180
Punish!

03:22:21,420 --> 03:22:21,820
Oh my god!

3174
03:22:22,060 --> 03:22:22,360
Oh my god!

3175
03:22:23,160 --> 03:22:24,680
Oh my god!

3176
03:22:24,860 --> 03:22:27,020
We take that.

3177
03:22:27,620 --> 03:22:28,120
Take it.

3178
03:22:28,220 --> 03:22:28,820
We love that.

3179
03:22:28,860 --> 03:22:30,760
Yeah, yeah, your head, your head!

3180
03:22:35,750 --> 03:22:37,350
Oh my god.

3181
03:22:38,010 --> 03:22:42,230
Oh, break it.

3182
03:22:43,450 --> 03:22:43,990
Yes!

3183
03:22:46,270 --> 03:22:47,890
Oh my god, don't let her get up!

3184
03:22:48,130 --> 03:22:49,890
This character is fucking insane.

3185
03:22:50,590 --> 03:22:51,570
I know, right?

3186
03:22:51,710 --> 03:22:53,950
What the fuck is blood doing?

3187
03:22:54,110 --> 03:22:54,950
Oh my god.

3188
03:22:56,390 --> 03:22:58,650
This is unbelievable.

3189
03:22:58,910 --> 03:23:00,370
You downloaded her back.

3190
03:23:04,210 --> 03:23:08,470
Every time Jack is on screen, the screen is shaking.

3191
03:23:08,990 --> 03:23:09,770
I'm getting dizzy.

3192
03:23:11,010 --> 03:23:11,650
Oh my god.

3193
03:23:11,950 --> 03:23:12,630
The dizzy meter.

3194
03:23:12,970 --> 03:23:14,130
Eddie's dizzy meter.

3195
03:23:14,390 --> 03:23:15,410
Ed She was so stupid.

3196
03:23:16,130 --> 03:23:19,730
Matt, you can duck her one-on-one.

3197
03:23:20,450 --> 03:23:20,990
Oh my.

3198
03:23:22,050 --> 03:23:22,470
Oh.

3199
03:23:28,870 --> 03:23:29,390
Fuck.

3200
03:23:30,270 --> 03:23:31,710
It's all right.

3201
03:23:36,170 --> 03:23:37,470
Wait, what an annoying character?

3202
03:23:43,760 --> 03:23:45,380
Oh wow, the counter hit you dead.

3203
03:23:45,760 --> 03:23:46,760
Oh my gosh, nice.

3204
03:23:47,160 --> 03:23:47,600
Nice.

3205
03:23:48,540 --> 03:23:49,240
First win.

3206
03:23:50,020 --> 03:23:50,680
Good shit.

3207
03:23:52,380 --> 03:23:52,600
Oh.

3208
03:23:54,840 --> 03:23:57,980
What the fuck was that roll, man?

3209
03:24:03,110 --> 03:24:04,250
What is this?

3210
03:24:04,290 --> 03:24:04,990
Oh, okay, man.

3211
03:24:07,830 --> 03:24:08,790
That's what you do!

3212
03:24:08,990 --> 03:24:09,490
That's what you do!

3213
03:24:09,550 --> 03:24:10,570
That's what you do to people!

3214
03:24:10,730 --> 03:24:14,530
Look what you're doing!

3215
03:24:15,190 --> 03:24:15,770
Look at you!

3216
03:24:17,110 --> 03:24:18,190
You hit that?

3217
03:24:19,530 --> 03:24:19,910
Yeah!

3218
03:24:21,170 --> 03:24:21,870
That's free, right?

3219
03:24:21,990 --> 03:24:22,630
She can't get upstairs.

3220
03:24:23,350 --> 03:24:24,030
What's the mix?

3221
03:24:24,730 --> 03:24:26,650
He might rage out if you run up into nothing.

3222
03:24:26,890 --> 03:24:27,810
Maybe run up into nothing.

3223
03:24:30,210 --> 03:24:31,070
And then the...

3224
03:24:31,070 --> 03:24:31,870
Heat dash mix.

3225
03:24:33,990 --> 03:24:34,650
What a fuck.

3226
03:24:36,190 --> 03:24:36,910
That was cute.

3227
03:24:37,350 --> 03:24:38,570
You got cute with it.

3228
03:24:38,670 --> 03:24:39,630
I like that.

3229
03:24:40,310 --> 03:24:40,790
Oh, fuck.

3230
03:24:44,540 --> 03:24:49,300
I think he's going to go low at the walls and then I'm just
going to try and get the down four one plus two maybe.

3231
03:24:49,960 --> 03:24:50,220
Oh, fuck.

3232
03:24:51,980 --> 03:24:52,560
Oh, wow.

3233
03:24:52,980 --> 03:24:55,080
Well, we didn't guess right there.

3234
03:24:56,380 --> 03:24:57,140
We all died.

3235
03:24:58,120 --> 03:24:58,300
Yeah.

3236
03:24:59,160 --> 03:25:00,120
Team every.

3237
03:25:01,280 --> 03:25:01,540
Nice.

3238
03:25:03,000 --> 03:25:03,420
Nice.

3239
03:25:04,260 --> 03:25:04,740
Okay.

3240
03:25:04,740 --> 03:25:05,320
Round four.

3241
03:25:05,580 --> 03:25:06,060
Pretty good.

3242
03:25:06,540 --> 03:25:07,020
Fight.

3243
03:25:08,020 --> 03:25:08,500
Fuck!

3244
03:25:13,400 --> 03:25:15,060
Oh, I can't believe- No way!

3245
03:25:15,600 --> 03:25:16,740
Oh my gosh, no!

3246
03:25:19,100 --> 03:25:20,060
She should die there.

3247
03:25:21,600 --> 03:25:22,260
Yeah, right?

3248
03:25:22,380 --> 03:25:23,080
The head's on.

3249
03:25:24,480 --> 03:25:25,100
That's her head.

3250
03:25:25,140 --> 03:25:25,780
Come on, man!

3251
03:25:28,940 --> 03:25:30,060
Oh my god.

03:25:30,220 --> 03:25:30,660
Okay, I'll try.

3253
03:25:31,480 --> 03:25:31,640
Alright.

3254
03:25:32,360 --> 03:25:33,660
It's like a self-destruct.

3255
03:25:37,940 --> 03:25:49,020
Oh No blue spark Oh It's okay Oh what a back step

3256

03:28:57,320 --> 03:29:05,040

03:29:08,710 --> 03:29:12,950
nice that's right there

3287
03:29:17,810 --> 03:29:24,810
i love that shove move from king yeah it's like it's like a
high school like back back of the high school near the

3288
03:29:24,810 --> 03:29:32,830
flagpole move oh rotated look no get rotated so good and I
never use it.

3289
03:29:33,090 --> 03:29:36,650
It basically just puts you in plus, which is up close.

3290
03:29:36,810 --> 03:29:37,350
It's so good.

3291
03:29:38,210 --> 03:29:38,770
Wow.

3292
03:29:38,930 --> 03:29:39,930
I mean, what a walk really.

3293
03:29:40,070 --> 03:29:40,070
Nice.

3294
03:29:40,530 --> 03:29:41,490
Whoa, what a duck.

3295
03:29:42,830 --> 03:29:43,390
Cup.

3296
03:29:44,010 --> 03:29:45,050
Oh my god.

3297
03:29:45,590 --> 03:29:48,150
CD added pressure makes you a better player.

3298
03:29:48,670 --> 03:29:49,450
He's stronger.

3299
03:29:49,990 --> 03:29:51,010
Yeah, you're stronger.

3300
03:29:53,050 --> 03:29:56,810
He said sweating, sweating, uh, key and peel Gif.

3301
03:29:57,450 --> 03:29:58,190
Oh yeah.

3302
03:29:58,550 --> 03:30:00,530
Yeah, I'm dying over here.

3303
03:30:01,530 --> 03:30:03,070
But you're winning!

3304
03:30:04,890 --> 03:30:08,130
You're winning the round robin one, the ones that don't
matter.

3305
03:30:08,750 --> 03:30:09,590
This is what matters.

3306
03:30:10,050 --> 03:30:10,910
I said this first slam.

3307
03:30:11,130 --> 03:30:12,970
We absolutely dominated round robin.

3308
03:30:13,210 --> 03:30:13,570
Who cares?

3309
03:30:13,710 --> 03:30:14,470
You know, that's...

3310
03:30:14,470 --> 03:30:16,310
What do the points even do?

3311
03:30:16,370 --> 03:30:18,010
Is that seating or...

3312
03:30:18,010 --> 03:30:21,130
Yeah, so like I guess whoever has the most points gets
better seating or whatever.

3313
03:30:21,530 --> 03:30:22,470
Yeah, so the way this works...

3314
03:30:22,470 --> 03:30:23,970
We should be able to choose our own opponents.

3315
03:30:26,170 --> 03:30:27,010
It's serious.

3316
03:30:27,730 --> 03:30:30,610
The one with the most points is to choose who wants to
fight.

3317
03:30:30,750 --> 03:30:32,150
Matt man against everyone.

3318
03:30:32,230 --> 03:30:33,510
We just keep putting in Matt.

3319
03:30:33,650 --> 03:30:35,010
I can beat some of the coaches.

3320
03:30:36,070 --> 03:30:38,390
He's just, he's just sweating and tired.

3321
03:30:39,170 --> 03:30:42,890
I don't think I can win, but the coaches, you're positive.

3322
03:30:43,370 --> 03:30:43,370
Okay.

3323
03:30:44,130 --> 03:30:45,250
Dude, Amaz is too random.

3324
03:30:45,470 --> 03:30:45,770
I can't.

3325
03:30:51,450 --> 03:30:59,790
I feel like if you win the most points, we should get like
one by game, where we just don't fight anybody.

3326
03:31:00,150 --> 03:31:06,170
I'm pretty sure that's what's going to happen that's what
happens yeah we get a buy yeah if we do well enough it's a

3327
03:31:06,170 --> 03:31:13,330
bracket at the end uh but there's one more round robin day
the points on friday or one more yeah yeah basically top two

3328
03:31:13,330 --> 03:31:22,350
teams will get like a buy okay so we got a buy last time
yeah you're in good company oh my god i haven't hit my

3329
03:31:22,350 --> 03:31:29,530
ceiling yet nice i mean just like how much we're dominating
you know

3330
03:31:33,110 --> 03:31:35,510
I don't know how pissed that guy was.

3331
03:31:36,750 --> 03:31:37,150
Wow.

3332
03:31:41,130 --> 03:31:43,830
How would that, someone in chat, my chat was like, she's a
robot.

3333
03:31:44,030 --> 03:31:44,850
Why does that even hurt?

3334
03:31:44,990 --> 03:31:46,130
And I think that's a good question.

3335
03:31:47,330 --> 03:31:51,250
Because she has, maybe she's programmed to feel pain.

3336
03:31:52,430 --> 03:31:54,770
Maybe her bar is just her being really annoyed.

3337
03:31:55,710 --> 03:31:56,530
Her annoyed bar.

3338
03:31:57,270 --> 03:31:57,950
Yeah, like, oh.

3339
03:31:57,950 --> 03:31:59,590
If you annoy her enough, she overheats.

3340
03:32:00,750 --> 03:32:11,270
of being annoyed does not come to why would you ever give
robots pain sensors that's so up taking the arms off is so

3341
03:32:11,270 --> 03:32:17,770
funny is that what that is off me i was like what is he
dropping on the ground they should make it so elissa

3342
03:32:17,770 --> 03:32:27,470
self-destructs when she gets killed oh my god i love you so
good like drop for a double ko yeah it's like a diva bomb oh

3343
03:32:27,470 --> 03:32:31,030
i had trouble Oh.

3344
03:32:39,920 --> 03:32:41,420
Okay, I saw you play Marvel Rivals.

3345
03:32:41,520 --> 03:32:42,100
Did you like it?

3346
03:32:42,420 --> 03:32:43,480
It was really fun.

3347
03:32:43,760 --> 03:32:48,260
I think it, like, I think, like, it feels more casual,
though, because of a third person.

3348
03:32:48,400 --> 03:32:49,180
I tried playing it yesterday.

3349
03:32:49,320 --> 03:32:49,920
I felt the same.

3350
03:32:50,280 --> 03:32:52,660
I think if it was, like, first person, it'd be more
competitive.

3351
03:32:53,420 --> 03:32:55,800
Yeah, the third-person aspect is kind of weird, though.

3352
03:32:56,620 --> 03:32:57,660
That's a mobile game, right?

3353
03:32:57,680 --> 03:32:58,840
They're trying to make it for phones, too.

3354
03:32:59,820 --> 03:33:02,500
I won't be surprised, because it's, like, net ease.

3355
03:33:03,700 --> 03:33:05,960
I played a little bit of it, and I was like, this is okay.

3356
03:33:06,240 --> 03:33:07,400
You know, I don't hate it.

3357
03:33:07,420 --> 03:33:10,120
I think it's not competitive, but more so for, like, for
fun.

3358
03:33:10,600 --> 03:33:14,980
I thought it was funny that, like, all the old Overwatch
players were grinding.

3359
03:33:15,080 --> 03:33:17,020
We're six-stacking rank and getting top 10.

3360
03:33:17,040 --> 03:33:18,220
Yeah, you got Sinatra and shit.

3361
03:33:18,340 --> 03:33:19,920
Yeah, it's dominating.

3362
03:33:20,640 --> 03:33:25,400
Yeah, all the Overwatch players, the old ones, are, like,
top 20 in Marvel Arrivals.

3363
03:33:26,180 --> 03:33:28,940
Because all they do is six-stack and bully the poor players.

3364
03:33:34,510 --> 03:33:36,170
We are not breaking one.

3365
03:33:36,690 --> 03:33:37,550
Not now, not ever.

3366
03:33:40,850 --> 03:33:53,890
oh wow what the fuck is that oh what the fuck what is that
move you can't even tell them to talk to coach like you are

3367
03:33:53,890 --> 03:33:55,850
the coach right now

3368
03:33:59,230 --> 03:34:06,390
shit off me those are arms yeah yeah they're her arms if you
check her 1 plus 2 she puts her head in your hands and then

3369
03:34:06,390 --> 03:34:09,370
you just put it back on her Like, not that, but...

3370
03:34:09,370 --> 03:34:09,910
He said, what?

3371
03:34:10,410 --> 03:34:11,870
Wait, you can put it back on her head?

3372
03:34:12,530 --> 03:34:15,190
Yeah, yeah, if he texts that grab, he puts it back on her.

3373
03:34:15,310 --> 03:34:16,470
Wait, that's so cool.

3374
03:34:17,010 --> 03:34:18,010
It's really funny.

3375
03:34:19,690 --> 03:34:20,870
Coach, show us that.

3376
03:34:22,050 --> 03:34:24,490
He was flabbergasted that he didn't take it.

3377
03:34:24,690 --> 03:34:25,250
Got it.

3378
03:34:25,490 --> 03:34:26,770
I thought I pressed it.

3379
03:34:26,850 --> 03:34:27,350
Okay, okay.

3380
03:34:27,830 --> 03:34:28,970
I want to see it.

3381
03:34:30,150 --> 03:34:30,550
Fight!

3382
03:34:32,530 --> 03:34:33,710
Just take it perfectly.

3383
03:34:33,830 --> 03:34:34,550
You got this.

3384
03:34:45,630 --> 03:34:46,430
Nice.

3385
03:34:46,790 --> 03:34:47,550
Oh, they're defensive.

3386
03:34:47,810 --> 03:34:48,590
I'm really good.

3387
03:34:53,030 --> 03:34:53,410
Oh, nice.

3388
03:34:54,230 --> 03:34:55,930
Oh, wow.

3389
03:34:58,080 --> 03:34:58,880
Oh.

3390
03:34:59,820 --> 03:35:00,820
Oh, my God.

3391
03:35:02,060 --> 03:35:03,700
Every button on the controller.

3392
03:35:05,340 --> 03:35:05,920
Round two.

3393
03:35:06,300 --> 03:35:07,880
That fucking delay too.

3394
03:35:08,820 --> 03:35:09,800
A buffet of options.

3395
03:35:11,180 --> 03:35:12,340
Oh, the jump.

3396
03:35:12,820 --> 03:35:13,380
Oh, my God.

3397
03:35:14,340 --> 03:35:15,080

Dude, that's a pretty well-gamed dude.

3411

Coach, good adaptation.

On the king team.

The TP.

3444
03:38:32,700 --> 03:38:35,500
It could be the rollback settings or whatever.

3445
03:38:36,100 --> 03:38:36,800
I did it.

3446
03:38:37,440 --> 03:38:40,240
Yeah, because they're like a setting that you're supposed to
set it to to make it so that you don't know.

3447
03:38:41,240 --> 03:38:42,700
What the fuck is...

3452
03:38:59,420 --> 03:39:01,120
You guys all believe in me?

3453
03:39:03,300 --> 03:39:08,420
We still have- Oh, she's saying it was three-frame rollback,
but then there's nothing you can really do about that.

3454
03:39:08,660 --> 03:39:10,040
That's just what it is.

3455
03:39:10,440 --> 03:39:10,980
Hey, man.

3456
03:39:11,080 --> 03:39:12,120
Guys, I promise.

3457
03:39:12,940 --> 03:39:13,800
It was more than three frames.

3458
03:39:14,000 --> 03:39:17,340
That was like, the PS4 cannot understand what's happening.

3459
03:39:17,640 --> 03:39:18,480
I guess it's PS5.

3460
03:39:18,580 --> 03:39:19,480
It felt like PS4.

3461
03:39:20,000 --> 03:39:21,700
Okay, I want to practice this.

3462
03:39:22,360 --> 03:39:25,200
Because I want to be able to do this one day.

3463
03:39:26,900 --> 03:39:29,240
Guys, I can only go up.

3464
03:39:30,460 --> 03:39:31,720
I can only go up.

3465
03:39:31,860 --> 03:39:32,820
I'm just telling her to switch it to standard.

3466
03:39:33,220 --> 03:39:33,940
I should do that too.

3467
03:39:34,040 --> 03:39:35,180
I should change the map.

3468
03:39:36,080 --> 03:39:37,040
I don't like this map.

3469
03:39:37,200 --> 03:39:37,780
It's too short.

3470
03:39:39,700 --> 03:39:40,840
Do the king bridge.

3471
03:39:41,800 --> 03:39:42,620
The what?

3472
03:39:44,420 --> 03:39:46,780
I saw it, but I don't know if you guys understand.

3473
03:39:47,100 --> 03:39:49,120
I don't know how that is done.

3474
03:39:52,360 --> 03:39:56,480
Yeah, once I got the PC plugged in, I'll be able to pull off
the King Bridge.

3475
03:39:56,860 --> 03:39:58,280
Thank you, promise on that.

3476
03:39:58,620 --> 03:40:01,740
Guys, I promise I'll plug in the PC.

3477
03:40:02,660 --> 03:40:03,960
It's by tomorrow.

3478
03:40:04,900 --> 03:40:07,020
I got, like, the first step done.

3479
03:40:07,780 --> 03:40:09,240
I, like, unboxed it.

3480
03:40:09,960 --> 03:40:11,740
Do they want us right into the next one?

3481
03:40:11,980 --> 03:40:13,380
Like, right now?

3482
03:40:14,500 --> 03:40:15,360
Are we hanging out?

3483
03:40:16,580 --> 03:40:17,000
I don't know.

3484
03:40:17,040 --> 03:40:18,260
I'm doing quick match and so some assistance.

3485
03:40:19,220 --> 03:40:19,920
Yeah, me too.

3486
03:40:19,960 --> 03:40:21,180
I'm doing quick match right now.

3487
03:40:22,840 --> 03:40:23,360
Who's this?

3488
03:40:23,360 --> 03:40:24,620
Yeah, stay warmed up, fellas.

3489
03:40:25,240 --> 03:40:26,680
Oh my gosh, she has five wins.

3490
03:40:26,820 --> 03:40:27,460
I'm fucked.

3491
03:40:28,380 --> 03:40:28,720
Okay.

3492
03:40:30,380 --> 03:40:33,740

3493
03:40:33,900 --> 03:40:34,280
Please.

3494
03:40:35,380 --> 03:40:38,680
I'm trying to do this combo that my coach is trying to teach
me.

3495
03:40:39,040 --> 03:40:39,860
I don't care.

3496
03:40:39,940 --> 03:40:40,920
I'm in a quick match.

3497
03:40:41,680 --> 03:40:42,100
Please.

3498
03:40:44,260 --> 03:40:44,920
There you go.

3499
03:40:46,380 --> 03:40:47,840

3500
03:40:48,020 --> 03:40:48,760
Please, please.

3501
03:40:48,880 --> 03:40:49,780
I need to do this combo.

3502
03:40:49,880 --> 03:40:51,080
I don't care if I lose this.

3503
03:40:52,360 --> 03:40:53,440
do this combo.

3504
03:40:53,800 --> 03:40:55,360
Don't make me pull off this.

3505
03:40:56,080 --> 03:40:56,800
Oh, never mind.

3506
03:40:56,940 --> 03:40:57,680

3507
03:41:01,960 --> 03:41:02,480

3508
03:41:04,740 --> 03:41:07,600

3511
03:41:12,820 --> 03:41:15,260
Oh my god, nothing matters anymore.

3512
03:41:15,420 --> 03:41:16,300
Now you die.

3513
03:41:19,920 --> 03:41:21,320

Oh, okay, never mind.

3524
03:41:44,160 --> 03:41:46,380
I thought she would let me keep doing this on her.

3525
03:41:47,720 --> 03:41:49,360
Guys, guys, this is actually...

3526
03:41:49,360 --> 03:41:52,340

That's the other combo I want to learn.

3530
03:42:26,450 --> 03:42:28,510
Oh my god, don't make me do this on you.

3531
03:42:28,650 --> 03:42:33,870
Now I can focus on improving my other stuff!

3532
03:42:33,970 --> 03:42:34,790
Like blocking!

3533
03:42:35,510 --> 03:42:37,330
Because what the fuck is blocking?

3534
03:42:42,130 --> 03:42:43,110
There we go.

3535
03:42:45,050 --> 03:42:45,530
Oh.

3536
03:42:46,390 --> 03:42:47,370
Guys, I blocked.

3537
03:42:48,390 --> 03:42:48,970
Guys, I...

3538
03:42:49,790 --> 03:42:51,190
Guys, I fucked around.

3539
03:42:53,730 --> 03:43:05,390
I was trying to learn how to block Guys Oh fuck Guys okay
look Look The goal was to block Nothing else I did not need

3540
03:43:05,390 --> 03:43:09,210
to learn anything else It was just about learning the blocks

3541
03:43:16,490 --> 03:43:26,630
We lost but we learned We actually hit that combo for the
first time in the against the real player i will learn how

3542
03:43:26,630 --> 03:43:34,550
the true it's a fighting game not a blocking game that is
true all i wanted was to be able to hit this move that's all

3543
03:43:34,550 --> 03:43:44,410
i wanted and also like this this is the next goal being able
to hit this and then this next goal being able to hit that

3544
03:43:44,410 --> 03:43:58,850
on the real player and then oh no that's the smash okay got
that no not that no not that one day blocking is disabled in

3545
03:43:58,850 --> 03:44:13,610
this game all right it's okay oh no it's an Eddie oh no
death cradle next you see my coach made me remove the

3546
03:44:13,610 --> 03:44:19,990
keybind to do the death cradle because I kept accidentally
pressing it and it's not good.

3547
03:44:22,890 --> 03:44:28,790
It was not good that I kept accidentally pressing it because
it's a key charge.

3548
03:44:31,790 --> 03:44:35,090
So I had to unbind it because of it.

3549
03:44:38,390 --> 03:44:39,070
Oh, please.

3550
03:44:39,270 --> 03:44:40,210
Eddie, please.

3551
03:44:41,590 --> 03:44:43,150
Please have mercy.

3552
03:44:43,950 --> 03:44:44,630
Oh, goodbye.

3553
03:44:49,650 --> 03:44:50,850
It's very predictable.

3554
03:44:51,090 --> 03:44:52,950
Not for that one guy I beat.

3555
03:44:55,530 --> 03:44:58,330
It might be predictable for you.

3556
03:44:58,850 --> 03:45:00,790
But I beat that one guy.

3557
03:45:01,430 --> 03:45:03,390
And he still didn't learn.

3558
03:45:06,290 --> 03:45:07,630
Oh wait he actually blocked that.

3559
03:45:07,650 --> 03:45:08,750
I could have grappled him.

3560
03:45:10,150 --> 03:45:11,090
He's blocked.

3561
03:45:12,530 --> 03:45:13,230
How much?

3562
03:45:15,570 --> 03:45:16,010
Block.

3563
03:45:16,990 --> 03:45:17,750
Pay to block.

3564
03:45:26,370 --> 03:45:30,250
They want me to start blocking, so like, can you please?

3565
03:45:32,410 --> 03:45:33,930
Okay, it's okay, it's a quick play.

3566
03:45:34,470 --> 03:45:35,750
There's no stakes involved.

3567
03:45:36,310 --> 03:45:37,530
They get paid off.

3568
03:45:42,450 --> 03:45:43,490

3569
03:45:43,730 --> 03:45:44,110

3628
03:49:22,350 --> 03:49:23,910

03:50:42,700 --> 03:50:44,320
He's like one of the OGs.

Is he?

3640
03:50:46,600 --> 03:50:50,840
I see him around Tekken streams even before the SageM thing
was even a thing.

3641
03:50:53,400 --> 03:50:56,160
I know he's been around for a very long time.

3642
03:50:56,460 --> 03:50:58,360

03:52:26,810 --> 03:52:28,650
You have more viewers than all of us come out.

3664
03:52:28,890 --> 03:52:29,870
You can't do that.

3665

03:52:33,210 --> 03:52:35,150
My viewers get it.

3667
03:52:35,350 --> 03:52:36,110
Your viewers don't.

3668
03:52:36,110 --> 03:52:38,430
You have like 5,000 people in there.

3669
03:52:38,430 --> 03:52:39,570
It's not the same.

3670
03:52:39,950 --> 03:52:40,830
5,000.

3671
03:52:41,110 --> 03:52:43,470
You have 5,000 people watching you.

3672
03:52:44,670 --> 03:52:46,290
My viewers are respectable.

And will not come to my stream and drop a Twitch Prime or

Because they got no money.

3678
03:52:56,150 --> 03:52:57,210
They got no money.

3679
03:52:57,270 --> 03:52:58,630
They're not subbing to me, right?

3680
03:52:59,230 --> 03:53:00,530
They don't got it like that.

3681
03:53:00,810 --> 03:53:01,830
Hey, Kony's chat.

Everyone just shilling her.

3693
03:53:19,950 --> 03:53:24,150
Everyone opening the jacket full of their potions and things
to sell in front of the viewers.

03:53:36,710 --> 03:53:37,610
Double king.

3699
03:53:37,850 --> 03:53:38,910
The same rank.

3700
03:53:39,150 --> 03:53:39,990
Wait, who's higher?

3701
03:53:40,350 --> 03:53:41,730
He's higher than me.

3702
03:53:43,630 --> 03:53:44,010
Here we go.

3703
03:53:44,410 --> 03:53:45,350
Oh my god, he's naked.

3704
03:53:45,350 --> 03:53:46,550
Cobra, you're like, king.

3705
03:53:46,850 --> 03:53:49,050
I'm getting distracted!

3706
03:53:49,390 --> 03:53:49,810
He's like a kid.

3707
03:53:49,810 --> 03:53:50,670
We disqualified.

3708
03:53:50,930 --> 03:53:52,230
I'm gonna get distracted.

3709
03:53:53,190 --> 03:53:54,570
I saw a Charlie on this.

3710
03:53:55,270 --> 03:53:56,430
You saw what?

3711
03:53:56,950 --> 03:53:58,090

3712
03:53:58,870 --> 03:54:00,530
Oh my god, Cobra get king up.

3713
03:54:00,710 --> 03:54:01,630
I'm getting distracted.

3714
03:54:04,910 --> 03:54:13,670

keep looking down what's happening bro bro look at his pecs

3715
03:54:13,670 --> 03:54:20,690

3717
03:54:33,210 --> 03:54:35,210
I can't tell which one is you because you have clothes.

3718
03:54:38,330 --> 03:54:40,510
Fuck, okay, I'm not focusing anymore, guys.

3719
03:54:40,790 --> 03:54:43,190
This thing is naked in the middle of time square!

3720
03:54:43,650 --> 03:54:46,590
There are a lot of- Is this grab I've never seen it in my
life?

3721
03:54:46,830 --> 03:54:47,510
Oh, okay.

3722
03:54:47,770 --> 03:54:49,430
All right, coach, you gotta tell her.

3723
03:54:50,490 --> 03:54:51,410
We're gonna have to talk to the coach.

3724
03:54:51,730 --> 03:54:56,050
If I tell her press one or two, then she'll stop playing and
look at the controller for five seconds.

3725
03:54:56,110 --> 03:54:57,150
That is not true.

3726
03:54:57,690 --> 03:54:59,670
That is absolutely not true.

3727
03:55:00,370 --> 03:55:02,010
That's- So I don't want to mess you up.

3728
03:55:02,410 --> 03:55:03,130
Where's one?

3729
03:55:04,170 --> 03:55:06,010
That's the one that's how I did it.

3730
03:55:06,370 --> 03:55:06,890
Stop!

3731
03:55:07,150 --> 03:55:09,110
No, I'm actually looking at the controller!

3732
03:55:10,130 --> 03:55:10,690
Don't lie!

3733
03:55:10,970 --> 03:55:11,270
Oh my gosh!

3734
03:55:13,510 --> 03:55:14,750
Oh my gosh!

3735
03:55:14,890 --> 03:55:15,370
You're just...

3736
03:55:15,370 --> 03:55:16,950
You're messing with my groove!

3737
03:55:16,970 --> 03:55:17,930
Oh my gosh, double jab combo!

3738
03:55:20,130 --> 03:55:21,770
You guys are messing with my groove!

3739
03:55:23,290 --> 03:55:24,310
No more jump!

3740
03:55:24,590 --> 03:55:25,690
I'm gonna be very serious.

3741
03:55:26,270 --> 03:55:27,270
It's a serious time?

3742
03:55:27,650 --> 03:55:28,630
A serious match.

3743
03:55:28,930 --> 03:55:30,790
No, but then if I'm serious then I'm gonna think!

3744
03:55:31,210 --> 03:55:32,430
Watch this.

3745
03:55:33,090 --> 03:55:33,770
Serious gameplay.

3746
03:55:33,770 --> 03:55:34,050
I'm serious.

3747
03:55:34,150 --> 03:55:35,330
I can't look at how beautiful.

3748
03:55:35,430 --> 03:55:36,250
For serious gamers.

3749
03:55:36,730 --> 03:55:38,290
I know it's so serious.

3750
03:55:38,970 --> 03:55:42,650
Please get away from me.

3751
03:55:43,970 --> 03:55:44,730
The spacing.

3752
03:55:45,430 --> 03:55:46,610
Oh my goodness.

3753
03:55:46,970 --> 03:55:47,730
Talk about movement.

3754
03:55:47,990 --> 03:55:48,390
Good bait.

3755
03:55:49,190 --> 03:55:49,290
Good bait.

3756
03:55:49,750 --> 03:55:50,110
Nice.

3757
03:55:51,450 --> 03:55:52,610
Great boy.

3758
03:55:52,990 --> 03:55:53,470
King gameplay.

3759
03:55:53,870 --> 03:55:54,410
Look at that.

3760
03:55:55,010 --> 03:55:55,690
Look at that.

3761
03:55:55,770 --> 03:55:56,570
I told you.

3762
03:55:56,970 --> 03:55:58,870
The less I focus, the better I do.

3763
03:55:59,530 --> 03:56:00,070
Yeah.

3764
03:56:02,970 --> 03:56:05,190
You guys didn't see Doki KBD just then?

3765
03:56:05,310 --> 03:56:05,670
I saw it.

3766
03:56:05,730 --> 03:56:06,530
The spacing was crazy.

3767
03:56:07,410 --> 03:56:09,810
Bro, I totally, that was totally intentional too.

3768
03:56:11,050 --> 03:56:11,450
I think?

3769
03:56:11,650 --> 03:56:12,110
I don't know.

3770
03:56:12,210 --> 03:56:14,150
I like don't think when I'm playing sometimes.

3771
03:56:14,930 --> 03:56:15,630
Is that noticeable?

3772
03:56:16,370 --> 03:56:16,710
Instinct.

3773
03:56:18,810 --> 03:56:20,310
That just means you're a gamer.

3774
03:56:21,010 --> 03:56:21,470
Oh, God.

3775
03:56:21,570 --> 03:56:22,650
Don't, you're jinxing me, guys.

3776
03:56:23,070 --> 03:56:24,270
Now I'm starting to think again.

3777
03:56:24,750 --> 03:56:25,390
This is bad.

3778
03:56:27,070 --> 03:56:28,130
Oh, she's a king.

3779
03:56:28,170 --> 03:56:29,170
It's like she's a king player.

3780
03:56:30,070 --> 03:56:30,670
Oh, my God.

3781
03:56:31,210 --> 03:56:33,050
But she's not that much of a...

3782
03:56:33,050 --> 03:56:34,610
The amount of shining with it is.

3783
03:56:35,170 --> 03:56:36,270
Oh, no!

3784
03:56:36,890 --> 03:56:37,570
It's cool, you're alive.

3785
03:56:37,830 --> 03:56:38,570
Oh, I'm...

3786
03:56:38,570 --> 03:56:40,630
Well, I'll drop the elbow on the foot.

3787
03:56:42,810 --> 03:56:43,270
Fight.

3788
03:56:44,410 --> 03:56:46,010
Oh, it's like she knows.

3789
03:56:46,230 --> 03:56:46,730
It's weird.

3790
03:56:48,810 --> 03:56:49,450
Oh, my God.

3791
03:56:49,970 --> 03:56:50,310
Damn.

3792
03:56:52,850 --> 03:56:53,530
Hit that.

3793
03:56:53,890 --> 03:56:54,830
Oh, no!

3794
03:56:56,110 --> 03:56:56,810
It's fine.

3795
03:56:57,350 --> 03:57:00,630
Oh, no, she does that thing that you told me about, like, my
one move.

3796
03:57:01,330 --> 03:57:02,210
Does she duck though?

3797
03:57:02,410 --> 03:57:03,690
Oh, she does.

3798
03:57:06,830 --> 03:57:08,210
Wait, you can do that?

3799
03:57:08,330 --> 03:57:09,310
What was that?

3800
03:57:10,550 --> 03:57:11,470
That's a misdemeanor.

3801
03:57:12,950 --> 03:57:13,350
Explain.

3802
03:57:14,170 --> 03:57:14,730

All right, run up and check this out.

3808
03:57:22,810 --> 03:57:23,350
Shining wizard.

3809
03:57:23,550 --> 03:57:23,910
It'll work.

3810
03:57:24,210 --> 03:57:25,590
Wait, what's shining wizard again?

3811
03:57:25,730 --> 03:57:26,170
The running grab.

3812
03:57:26,870 --> 03:57:27,710
Oh, the running grab!

3813
03:57:27,890 --> 03:57:28,890
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

3814
03:57:29,050 --> 03:57:29,350
The Tomahawk.

3815
03:57:29,550 --> 03:57:29,810
The Tomahawk.

3816
03:57:29,930 --> 03:57:30,570
Okay, the Tomahawk.

3817
03:57:31,910 --> 03:57:32,830
Where was it?

3818
03:57:32,950 --> 03:57:33,770
Where was it?

3819
03:57:34,150 --> 03:57:34,570
Oh!

3820
03:57:35,830 --> 03:57:38,410
Looking on the giant channel of all the buttons.

3821
03:57:38,850 --> 03:57:38,910
Oh,

3822
03:57:42,330 --> 03:57:42,910

3823
03:57:44,050 --> 03:57:47,650
You gotta press 1, X, or square.

3824
03:57:47,690 --> 03:57:49,610
I need to fucking stop doing that.

3825
03:57:49,810 --> 03:57:50,830
I don't know.

3826
03:57:52,430 --> 03:57:56,250
Guys, the more I start thinking, the worse I'm doing, I feel
like...

3827
03:57:56,250 --> 03:57:56,950
Look at King's nipples.

3828
03:57:58,310 --> 03:58:01,030
I was doing better when I was distracted.

3829
03:58:02,350 --> 03:58:03,830
Oh, no, good break.

3830
03:58:04,190 --> 03:58:04,990
Oh, okay.

3831
03:58:04,990 --> 03:58:05,590
That's okay.

3832
03:58:06,070 --> 03:58:06,650
Did I go?

3833
03:58:07,430 --> 03:58:08,010
Do I hit that?

3834
03:58:08,210 --> 03:58:08,750
That's crazy.

3835
03:58:08,970 --> 03:58:10,610
No, what you run?

3836
03:58:12,170 --> 03:58:13,190
Try, not try, not try.

3837
03:58:13,970 --> 03:58:15,170
All right, nice try, nice try.

3838
03:58:16,170 --> 03:58:18,450
Okay, I need to turn my brain off again.

3839
03:58:19,890 --> 03:58:21,090
He just can't be naughty.

3840
03:58:21,270 --> 03:58:21,770
Look at him vascular.

3841
03:58:22,310 --> 03:58:22,870
I can't.

3842
03:58:23,110 --> 03:58:24,210
It's just so distracting.

3843
03:58:25,490 --> 03:58:26,970
It's like all there.

3844
03:58:28,130 --> 03:58:29,990

Confirmed.

3850
03:59:06,450 --> 03:59:07,130
Wait, did I get that?

3851
03:59:07,170 --> 03:59:07,650

3852
03:59:07,970 --> 03:59:08,230

3858
03:59:19,990 --> 03:59:22,170
And it hurts more because he doesn't have closing.

3859
03:59:22,550 --> 03:59:23,370
Yeah, that's true.

3860
03:59:23,430 --> 03:59:23,690
That's true.

3861
03:59:23,750 --> 03:59:24,310
There's no padding.

3862
03:59:25,210 --> 03:59:26,670
There's no padding for her.

I'll remember that.

3953
04:03:26,470 --> 04:03:27,990
You have a heat phone to keep in mind.

3954
04:03:32,700 --> 04:03:33,140
Oops.

3955
04:03:33,140 --> 04:03:33,820

3961
04:03:47,320 --> 04:03:48,360
Remember the square!

3962
04:03:50,220 --> 04:03:52,620
Yo, why don't these guys know how to avoid that?

3963
04:03:57,930 --> 04:03:58,410
Yo.

3964
04:03:59,070 --> 04:03:59,990

04:04:03,470 --> 04:04:03,950
Fight!

3967
04:04:11,870 --> 04:04:13,810
I know her strength is over.

3968
04:04:15,030 --> 04:04:16,590
You can hop kick that if you block it.

3969
04:04:20,950 --> 04:04:21,430
Nice.

3970
04:04:21,750 --> 04:04:21,870

Okay.

3972
04:04:35,790 --> 04:04:36,530
Good duck.

3973
04:04:37,350 --> 04:04:40,330
He's going to duck more than he doesn't, I think, in that
situation.

3974
04:04:40,550 --> 04:04:40,670
You're right.

3975
04:04:42,090 --> 04:04:42,510
He did.

3976
04:04:42,730 --> 04:04:42,990
Yeah.

3977
04:04:43,410 --> 04:04:43,470
Yeah.

3978
04:04:44,110 --> 04:04:44,230
Yeah.

Square.

3985
04:05:01,250 --> 04:05:01,890
Nice!

3986
04:05:01,890 --> 04:05:03,810
Oh my god, that's a professional king player.

3987
04:05:09,270 --> 04:05:09,810
Hell yeah.

3988
04:05:11,490 --> 04:05:14,470
Yeah, definitely, definitely scared of the king grab, so

3992
04:05:40,510 --> 04:05:46,390
like a tf2 scout I miss TF2 so much though.

3993
04:05:46,830 --> 04:05:49,290
We have TF2 at home, Marvel Rivals.

3994
04:05:49,610 --> 04:05:50,130
Yay!

3995
04:05:51,310 --> 04:05:52,430
That's true.

3996
04:05:53,050 --> 04:05:54,170
It's the offense.

3997
04:05:54,770 --> 04:05:54,790
Okay.

3998
04:05:55,970 --> 04:05:57,470
Typical Reyna activity.

3999
04:05:58,530 --> 04:05:59,310
Round two.

4000
04:06:00,370 --> 04:06:00,690
Fight.

4001
04:06:01,990 --> 04:06:02,190
Okay.

4002
04:06:02,670 --> 04:06:04,610
I'm gonna try to find more ways to do that.

4003
04:06:05,270 --> 04:06:06,250
He's not ready for it.

4004
04:06:06,470 --> 04:06:09,550
Apparently you see Jam and Steve said that's how Triconi
dresses.

4005
04:06:12,770 --> 04:06:14,150
What a hot kick.

4006
04:06:14,470 --> 04:06:16,110
How the fuck did that hop kick go?

4007
04:06:17,230 --> 04:06:19,250
One day I'll be able to do a hop kick.

4008
04:06:20,790 --> 04:06:22,550
Just like my coach.

4009
04:06:23,750 --> 04:06:24,630
Coach Kony.

4010
04:06:24,870 --> 04:06:26,010
Coach Kony, let's go!

4011
04:06:26,030 --> 04:06:26,830
He's just holying.

4012
04:06:27,430 --> 04:06:27,430
Honestly.

4013
04:06:28,090 --> 04:06:29,690
He grows a shoe, honestly.

4014
04:06:30,210 --> 04:06:31,210
Round 3.

4015
04:06:32,250 --> 04:06:32,730
Fight.

4016
04:06:33,930 --> 04:06:34,850
Oh, that's a... Okay.

4017
04:06:36,590 --> 04:06:39,190
I thought that was a low, but she did the duck too.

4018
04:06:40,890 --> 04:06:41,370
Hmm.

4019
04:06:44,470 --> 04:06:45,790
Oh my god.

4020
04:06:46,330 --> 04:06:46,330
Oh,

4021
04:06:49,920 --> 04:06:51,180
you just got to hold back there.

4022
04:06:51,960 --> 04:06:52,740
You just have to block.

4023
04:06:54,360 --> 04:06:54,640
Okay.

4024
04:06:59,200 --> 04:06:59,680
Wow.

4025
04:07:00,360 --> 04:07:00,760
Oh.

4026
04:07:02,620 --> 04:07:03,100
Nice.

4027
04:07:03,360 --> 04:07:03,820
Good duck.

4028
04:07:03,960 --> 04:07:04,360
Good duck.

4029
04:07:04,620 --> 04:07:04,720
Yeah.

4030
04:07:06,040 --> 04:07:06,640
That's fair.

4031
04:07:06,760 --> 04:07:07,040
That's fair.

4032
04:07:07,260 --> 04:07:08,020
She's ready now.

4033
04:07:09,720 --> 04:07:13,160
Okay, she's ducking all the time.

4034
04:07:13,640 --> 04:07:13,800
Yeah.

4035
04:07:14,260 --> 04:07:15,060
Now it's just hop kicks.

4036
04:07:15,300 --> 04:07:15,580
Okay.

Oh, what a quest, dude.

4041
04:07:52,800 --> 04:07:54,320
Remember, if you block him, don't launch it.

4042
04:07:57,460 --> 04:07:58,100
That's funny.

4043
04:07:58,320 --> 04:07:58,760
He's just talking.

No, he'll duck every time now.

We know this.

4049
04:08:02,720 --> 04:08:02,980
Yeah.

4050
04:08:03,160 --> 04:08:04,080

Oh, Jesus.

4063
04:08:25,980 --> 04:08:26,380
Rage.

4064
04:08:27,180 --> 04:08:27,600
Done deal.

Nice nut shot.

4066
04:08:34,680 --> 04:08:37,880
Every time she does that, I'm like, okay, that's a low
because he keeps fucking hitting.

4067
04:08:37,920 --> 04:08:39,400
It's going to be a mid every time.

4068
04:08:40,940 --> 04:08:42,760
He's doing it over and over, man.

4069
04:08:42,880 --> 04:08:44,540
Like, it's the same fucking thing.

4070
04:08:44,900 --> 04:08:45,800
What the fuck?

4071
04:08:47,980 --> 04:08:48,880
Dude, that didn't hit.

4072
04:08:49,600 --> 04:08:52,040
I keep thinking it's low like I'm going low.

4073
04:08:52,400 --> 04:08:53,300
She's just hitting mid.

4074
04:08:54,660 --> 04:08:54,660
Yeah

4075
04:08:57,820 --> 04:09:05,620

That was weird.

4091
04:10:07,030 --> 04:10:07,950
I didn't mean to do that.

4092
04:10:08,050 --> 04:10:08,970
I didn't mean to do that parry.

4093
04:10:09,170 --> 04:10:10,050
I tried to do back three.

4094
04:10:11,090 --> 04:10:11,350

Dude!

4098
04:10:16,850 --> 04:10:18,230
It's literally just holding down.

4099
04:10:18,230 --> 04:10:18,810
You hit her?

4100
04:10:19,470 --> 04:10:19,750
Yeah.

4101
04:10:19,750 --> 04:10:20,210

4103
04:10:20,530 --> 04:10:20,990
Just hop kick.

04:10:22,910 --> 04:10:23,190
Yeah.

4105
04:10:24,650 --> 04:10:25,890
I'm trying to be playing out.

4106
04:10:26,090 --> 04:10:27,170
I'm playing frustrated.

4107
04:10:28,050 --> 04:10:28,910
Yeah, that's all right.

4108
04:10:29,090 --> 04:10:29,910
All right, lucky I'm lucky.

4109
04:10:32,770 --> 04:10:34,250
This guy's just one thing.

4110
04:10:34,610 --> 04:10:42,550
And so he, now that you know that, you can use it for next
time oh it's just where the one with more points yeah i just

4111
04:10:42,550 --> 04:10:47,630
need more time like i thought i kept thinking it would
change it's just one fucking thing over and over okay all

4112
04:10:47,630 --> 04:10:57,090
right it's cool it's all right dokey won right or did don't
give yeah i was you forgot i won that was the most hype shit

4113
04:10:57,090 --> 04:11:02,430
no it was hype i just wanted to make sure you just wanted to
make sure it wasn't the fluke

4114
04:11:07,870 --> 04:11:15,970
where are you playing against oh i played this guy yesterday
so how didn't you win you made like i did win but i think it

4115
04:11:15,970 --> 04:11:24,410
was uh i think it was definitely matchup gap for him and i
think he probably is coming correct but that's okay if he

4116
04:11:24,410 --> 04:11:34,070
wins then uh it'll be the same story but like the other way
if he silently enters me i i will be in trouble for real you

4117
04:11:34,070 --> 04:11:44,590
come back one to if he hits you into it then just eat the
mix the mid heat engages the low just leads into another mix

4118
04:11:44,590 --> 04:11:53,790
if he dynamically enters me i think i'll be okay that's not
how it's working like that why why that's what it is dynamic

4119
04:11:53,790 --> 04:12:05,190
entry and silent entry yeah you're right either way i'm
getting entered well do running one plus twos into the

4120
04:12:05,190 --> 04:12:17,670
hunting grab or anything condition this man oh god oh my god
oh my god he's naked too don't get distracted like me shadow

4121
04:12:17,670 --> 04:12:25,390

04:12:25,390 --> 04:12:31,150
sonic right wow he's breaking doubles oh oh we can't break

4123
04:12:36,090 --> 04:12:37,150
He might bring a gun.

4124
04:12:37,750 --> 04:12:38,570
Holy fuck.

4125
04:12:39,690 --> 04:12:40,470
What a kick.

4126
04:12:41,410 --> 04:12:42,070
Oh my.

4127
04:12:42,070 --> 04:12:42,790
Good crap.

4128
04:12:43,570 --> 04:12:43,630
Oh.

4129
04:12:45,710 --> 04:12:46,530
Nice block.

4130
04:12:46,710 --> 04:12:47,090
Oh, nice.

4131
04:12:48,570 --> 04:12:49,250
I'm playing autopilot.

4132
04:12:49,410 --> 04:12:50,350
I need to fucking lock in.

4133
04:12:50,430 --> 04:12:51,250
That was sloppy.

4134
04:12:51,890 --> 04:12:52,490
Let's go.

4135
04:12:52,690 --> 04:12:53,930
I think he's also autopilot.

4136
04:12:54,150 --> 04:12:54,690
I think he's also autopiloting a little bit.

4137
04:13:02,130 --> 04:13:03,750
A primitive mix up.

4138
04:13:07,430 --> 04:13:09,770
You can forward to one that launcher he's trying.

4139
04:13:12,370 --> 04:13:14,130
Oh my god.

4140
04:13:14,570 --> 04:13:15,250
That was close.

4141
04:13:15,530 --> 04:13:17,130
That was a close twin piston.

4142
04:13:18,300 --> 04:13:18,830
Walk in.

4143
04:13:19,130 --> 04:13:19,950
Round three.

4144
04:13:27,540 --> 04:13:29,240
Mix it up.

4145
04:13:34,370 --> 04:13:34,950
Nice.

4146
04:13:37,110 --> 04:13:37,550
Nice.

4147
04:13:37,970 --> 04:13:38,390
Okay.

4148
04:13:40,410 --> 04:13:41,550
Look at that damage.

4149
04:13:44,670 --> 04:13:45,550
Good shit.

4150
04:13:45,750 --> 04:13:45,910
Nice.

4151
04:13:45,910 --> 04:13:46,150
Nice.

4152
04:13:46,250 --> 04:13:46,650
I got him.

4153
04:13:46,650 --> 04:13:47,130
I got him.

4154
04:13:47,130 --> 04:13:47,490
Nice.

4155
04:13:47,490 --> 04:13:47,570
I got him.

4156
04:13:47,590 --> 04:13:47,950

04:19:31,550 --> 04:19:33,030
Was that intentional?

4258
04:19:33,030 --> 04:19:33,890

04:20:09,190 --> 04:20:10,230
What about this integrity?

4265

This is crazy.

4278
04:20:54,030 --> 04:20:56,350
Seychem's last three, run it back.

4279
04:20:56,550 --> 04:20:58,050
I begged for him, he begged for me.

4280
04:20:58,210 --> 04:20:59,550
That's how it worked out, dude.

4281
04:21:00,710 --> 04:21:03,230
I think Seychem just didn't want to pay for more evo trips.

4282
04:21:04,150 --> 04:21:05,650
He just let him inject these things.

4283
04:21:11,590 --> 04:21:12,030
Wow.

4284
04:21:12,710 --> 04:21:13,950

04:21:15,450 --> 04:21:15,710
No!

4287
04:21:15,890 --> 04:21:17,090

It was so worth it.

4301
04:21:50,890 --> 04:21:51,490
It was so worth it.

4302
04:21:51,710 --> 04:21:52,270

4353
04:25:15,210 --> 04:25:15,950
Hope to see you there.

4354
04:25:20,210 --> 04:25:22,150
That chandelier should fall on people.

4355
04:25:22,510 --> 04:25:24,970
How can I focus after what's happened?

4356
04:25:25,770 --> 04:25:30,330
I feel like we should get extra points for making somebody
plug.

4357
04:25:31,190 --> 04:25:33,050
I mean, like, it's real low.

4358
04:25:33,270 --> 04:25:33,370
Yeah.

4359
04:25:35,990 --> 04:25:36,510
Oh, shit.

4360
04:25:37,070 --> 04:25:39,390
Rob Pro, focus up.

4361
04:25:40,470 --> 04:25:41,010
How?

4362
04:25:41,230 --> 04:25:42,930
Do you see what's going on?

4363
04:25:43,190 --> 04:25:43,690
How?

4364
04:25:45,370 --> 04:25:48,250
If I can play while distracted, so can you.

4365
04:25:49,550 --> 04:25:49,890
Oh.

4366
04:25:50,810 --> 04:25:51,710
Maybe not.

4367
04:26:03,700 --> 04:26:05,380
Come on, you got this.

4368
04:26:05,800 --> 04:26:07,180
I don't know what his habits are.

4369
04:26:07,260 --> 04:26:08,400
I guess we'll figure them out here.

4370
04:26:09,100 --> 04:26:10,220
We're doing it live.

4371
04:26:10,880 --> 04:26:12,140
Do it live.

4372
04:26:13,100 --> 04:26:16,220
Hold in all.

4373
04:26:25,820 --> 04:26:26,200
What?

4374
04:26:28,500 --> 04:26:30,940
I'm telling y'all, it's just rage art, dude.

4375
04:26:31,140 --> 04:26:32,480
That's what I'm saying, man.

4376
04:26:33,400 --> 04:26:36,500
It's funny that the coaches are doing it way more than
anyone else.

4377
04:26:36,680 --> 04:26:37,620
Just rip it, bro.

4378
04:26:37,660 --> 04:26:38,840
You're right.

4379
04:26:38,980 --> 04:26:39,140
You're right, bro.

4380
04:26:39,400 --> 04:26:39,700
You're right.

4381
04:26:39,980 --> 04:26:40,880
Fucking rip it.

4382
04:26:41,020 --> 04:26:41,400
You're right.

4383
04:26:42,000 --> 04:26:43,280
It's all about the wins.

4384
04:26:45,420 --> 04:26:47,900
Consider it like armor, but it also armor blows.

4385
04:26:54,240 --> 04:26:54,720
Oh, well.

4386
04:26:54,940 --> 04:26:55,420
Nice.

4387
04:26:56,280 --> 04:26:56,560
Oh, nice.

4388
04:26:56,560 --> 04:26:57,320
Oh, my God.

4389
04:26:57,400 --> 04:26:57,800
I'm in.

4390
04:26:57,920 --> 04:26:59,100
Oh, my God.

4391
04:26:59,720 --> 04:27:00,520
Big tummy ache.

4392
04:27:02,400 --> 04:27:02,760
Nice.

4393
04:27:04,240 --> 04:27:04,620
Oh.

4394
04:27:04,920 --> 04:27:05,640
This is...

4395
04:27:05,640 --> 04:27:06,360
Oh, my God.

4396
04:27:06,360 --> 04:27:08,240
Oh my god.

4397
04:27:08,400 --> 04:27:09,020
Bro.

4398
04:27:09,540 --> 04:27:09,780
Chill.

4399
04:27:11,020 --> 04:27:11,580
Relax.

4400
04:27:11,960 --> 04:27:12,280
All right, put him down.

4401
04:27:12,960 --> 04:27:14,240
Give him another turn.

4402
04:27:14,420 --> 04:27:15,000
Put him down, bro.

4403
04:27:15,520 --> 04:27:16,300
It's his turn.

4404
04:27:16,420 --> 04:27:16,680
Oh.

4405
04:27:17,840 --> 04:27:18,680
He picks it up.

4406
04:27:18,680 --> 04:27:19,640
Close credit seed.

4407
04:27:21,820 --> 04:27:22,640
Samuel L.

4408
04:27:22,720 --> 04:27:23,760
Jackson comes in.

4409
04:27:25,980 --> 04:27:27,580
Put that young woman down.

4410
04:27:29,160 --> 04:27:29,500
Oh.

4411
04:27:30,080 --> 04:27:31,580
Oh my god.

4412
04:27:31,980 --> 04:27:33,200
Dude, are you serious?

4413
04:27:37,380 --> 04:27:38,100
Nice!

4414
04:27:39,560 --> 04:27:42,060
Oh my god, he's locking it in!

4415
04:27:42,220 --> 04:27:43,080
You go, coach!

4416
04:27:43,680 --> 04:27:44,380
Second coach!

4417
04:27:46,040 --> 04:27:47,280
The side coach!

4418
04:27:47,500 --> 04:27:48,500
The side coach!

4419
04:27:50,160 --> 04:27:50,960
Go coach!

4420
04:27:52,280 --> 04:27:53,200
Assistant coach!

4421
04:27:53,260 --> 04:27:54,160
Coach B.

4422
04:27:54,540 --> 04:27:56,560
It's like a summer camp, you know.

4423
04:27:56,960 --> 04:27:57,460
Yeah, yeah.

4424
04:27:59,180 --> 04:28:00,340
Substitute teacher.

4425
04:28:02,920 --> 04:28:03,440
Nice.

4426
04:28:04,420 --> 04:28:05,580
Oh, good break.

4427
04:28:06,600 --> 04:28:08,080
Oh, this guy's playing technique.

4428
04:28:10,300 --> 04:28:10,630
Wait.

4429
04:28:12,320 --> 04:28:12,720
What the?

4430
04:28:15,420 --> 04:28:15,700
Surely.

4431
04:28:17,800 --> 04:28:19,700
Okay, I was gonna say.

4432
04:28:22,720 --> 04:28:24,600
Break the window!

4433
04:28:27,100 --> 04:28:27,760
Nice.

4434
04:28:29,000 --> 04:28:30,340
There's that back swing.

4435
04:28:31,760 --> 04:28:32,160
Uh-oh.

4436
04:28:32,720 --> 04:28:33,340
Oh, no.

4437
04:28:33,540 --> 04:28:34,680
Does he got a mega combo?

4438
04:28:35,100 --> 04:28:35,700
This Mike?

4439
04:28:36,180 --> 04:28:36,320
What?

4440
04:28:36,360 --> 04:28:39,420
Oh my god, he broke two windows.

4441
04:28:40,400 --> 04:28:41,000
Processing.

4442
04:28:41,400 --> 04:28:43,360
Unc processing combo.

4443
04:28:44,200 --> 04:28:45,600
Nice, nice, nice.

4444
04:28:46,520 --> 04:28:48,380
What a fucked up stage!

4445
04:28:49,140 --> 04:28:50,080
Oh my god.

4446
04:28:51,080 --> 04:28:53,720
They got nukes in the sunroom.

4447
04:28:53,820 --> 04:28:57,380
Oh, this is where Jack is built.

4448
04:28:57,920 --> 04:28:58,120
Yeah.

4449
04:28:58,440 --> 04:28:59,960
When would they expect it?

4450
04:29:01,080 --> 04:29:02,100
Dude, everything's exploding.

4451
04:29:02,300 --> 04:29:03,540
Where is the safety here?

4452
04:29:09,200 --> 04:29:11,590
I think King has four clips that are about.

4453
04:29:13,560 --> 04:29:14,100
Oh nice.

4454
04:29:17,000 --> 04:29:18,480
Oh my god.

4455
04:29:23,670 --> 04:29:23,910
Oh no.

4456
04:29:27,850 --> 04:29:28,350
Enough.

4457
04:29:29,210 --> 04:29:29,550
Oh.

4458
04:29:29,590 --> 04:29:30,230
Freaky on Susanna.

4459
04:29:42,020 --> 04:29:42,520
Oh.

4460
04:29:42,660 --> 04:29:43,120
Oh the brakes.

4461
04:29:43,340 --> 04:29:44,020
How did you break that?

4462
04:29:44,400 --> 04:29:46,560
Yeah, you just pushed her off.

4463
04:29:51,030 --> 04:29:51,430
Oh!

4464
04:29:56,610 --> 04:29:59,210
That's right, keep being close for the YouTube video.

4465
04:29:59,270 --> 04:30:00,990
Dude, I...

4466

So many moves.

4467
04:30:03,110 --> 04:30:03,730
Round four.

4468
04:30:04,830 --> 04:30:05,150
Fight.

4469
04:30:15,110 --> 04:30:16,330
Please, stop.

4470
04:30:20,210 --> 04:30:21,450
They're fast.

4471
04:30:21,710 --> 04:30:22,130
I know.

4472
04:30:22,310 --> 04:30:22,790
With Muhammad Ali.

4473
04:30:23,890 --> 04:30:25,410
The dodges, too.

4474
04:30:25,650 --> 04:30:25,950
Ooh!

4475
04:30:26,230 --> 04:30:26,650

04:30:30,370 --> 04:30:30,930
Okay.

04:30:31,310 --> 04:30:31,790
Nice.

4479
04:30:35,230 --> 04:30:36,750
Oh my god, the damage?

4480
04:30:40,770 --> 04:30:41,330
Okay.

4481
04:30:41,970 --> 04:30:42,250
Dead?

4482
04:30:42,430 --> 04:30:43,130
Oh, is she dead?

4483
04:30:43,410 --> 04:30:43,430
Yeah.

4484
04:30:43,730 --> 04:30:44,350
Holy crap.

04:30:44,610 --> 04:30:44,670
Yeah!

4486
04:30:45,190 --> 04:30:46,630
He's strong.

4487
04:30:51,350 --> 04:30:52,730
He's a platform again.

4488
04:30:52,990 --> 04:30:54,030
He did a four here.

4489
04:31:02,180 --> 04:31:02,640
Damage.

4490
04:31:03,080 --> 04:31:03,440

The...

4518
04:32:31,130 --> 04:32:33,970
Azasena's back swing where she like evades is launch
punishment.

Oh wow.

4520
04:32:35,810 --> 04:32:37,170
Most back swings in the game though.

4521
04:32:37,370 --> 04:32:38,270
Oh my god!

4522
04:32:38,710 --> 04:32:40,610
Read her fucking mind!

4523
04:32:40,930 --> 04:32:41,490
He was ready.

4524
04:32:43,230 --> 04:32:44,130
Oh my god!

4525
04:32:44,290 --> 04:32:44,590
Oh!

4526
04:32:44,690 --> 04:32:45,110
Oh!

4527
04:32:47,150 --> 04:32:48,670
Oh, let's go!

4528
04:32:49,390 --> 04:32:50,610
This stage, bro.

4529
04:32:51,550 --> 04:32:52,990
Pizza Hut manager.

4530
04:32:53,690 --> 04:32:54,490
Oh my god.

4531
04:32:55,570 --> 04:32:56,870
This is what it's like to block.

4532
04:32:58,670 --> 04:32:58,870
Just like a ninja.

4533
04:32:59,090 --> 04:32:59,410
Nice.

4534
04:33:00,050 --> 04:33:01,410
It is a nair, yeah.

4535
04:33:03,830 --> 04:33:04,130
Nice.

4536
04:33:14,380 --> 04:33:15,280
Just pressure.

4537
04:33:15,440 --> 04:33:15,900
Just pressure.

4538
04:33:17,000 --> 04:33:18,120
Sometimes you go wrong.

4539
04:33:18,760 --> 04:33:18,760
Yeah.

4540
04:33:19,940 --> 04:33:21,320
How was that not counter hit?

4541
04:33:21,380 --> 04:33:22,700
She screamed when I hit her.

4542
04:33:24,360 --> 04:33:25,800
She's on the Wi-Fi.

4543
04:33:28,140 --> 04:33:28,760
What the?

4544
04:33:28,900 --> 04:33:29,580
Oh, he's nice.

4545
04:33:29,920 --> 04:33:31,200
That was a good block, though.

4546
04:33:32,560 --> 04:33:32,960
Oh!

4547
04:33:35,000 --> 04:33:35,520
That's dumb.

4548
04:33:35,540 --> 04:33:36,600
Wow, he's ducking hard.

4549
04:33:37,940 --> 04:33:38,580
He knows.

4550
04:33:44,590 --> 04:33:45,750
Oh, that's close.

4551
04:33:46,070 --> 04:33:47,170
Oh, here we go, bro.

4552
04:33:47,670 --> 04:33:48,670
Oh, let's go, baby.

4553
04:33:49,250 --> 04:33:50,650
Wrap it up.

4554
04:33:53,210 --> 04:33:53,730
Nice!

4555
04:33:54,330 --> 04:33:54,770
Nice.

4556
04:33:54,830 --> 04:33:55,090
Shit.

4557
04:34:00,430 --> 04:34:01,650
Damn it.

4558
04:34:01,650 --> 04:34:04,730
That's good stuff.

4559
04:34:04,890 --> 04:34:06,770
Oh, that's unfortunate.

4560
04:34:12,930 --> 04:34:14,510
Oh my god!

4561
04:34:14,610 --> 04:34:15,690
Oh, so close!

4562
04:34:18,170 --> 04:34:19,470
Nice, nice.

4563
04:34:19,970 --> 04:34:20,870
Pretty good.

4564
04:34:20,890 --> 04:34:22,030
Good player, bro.

4565
04:34:22,250 --> 04:34:22,530
Good player.

4566
04:34:24,770 --> 04:34:25,410
Chow.

4567
04:34:26,190 --> 04:34:26,870
That was a toughie.

4568
04:34:28,250 --> 04:34:29,710
There's no 3-2 though.

4569
04:34:29,770 --> 04:34:30,370
Yeah, 3-2.

4570
04:34:30,550 --> 04:34:31,130
We won it.

4571
04:34:31,190 --> 04:34:37,390
We won positive on most of our matches if not yeah i'm
looking at the scoreboard i don't know if it's updated but

4572
04:34:37,390 --> 04:34:40,950
myk well i think they're still playing myk is first at 14.

4573
04:34:41,670 --> 04:34:44,270
we didn't get updated yet but we're at 12.

4574
04:34:44,510 --> 04:34:47,510
so if we went three two i think we're we're 15.

4575
04:34:48,770 --> 04:34:57,010
wait so we're first unless hide tone yeah we're first unless
hide tone sweeps wait have they finished your game yet or if

4576
04:34:57,010 --> 04:35:05,630
they KFM is 7, so I don't think they can hit us no matter
what.

4577
04:35:07,390 --> 04:35:07,870
But...

4578
04:35:07,870 --> 04:35:09,430
Yeah, so we're at 15.

4579
04:35:09,870 --> 04:35:11,770
If Hytone goes 4-1, we tie.

4580
04:35:12,210 --> 04:35:12,910
Oh, okay.

4581
04:35:13,170 --> 04:35:14,010
So we...

4582
04:35:14,010 --> 04:35:15,410
Hey, that's really good!

4583
04:35:15,730 --> 04:35:16,390
We might have won.

4584
04:35:16,670 --> 04:35:17,030
That's incredibly good.

4585
04:35:17,530 --> 04:35:17,750
Yeah.

4586
04:35:17,990 --> 04:35:20,650
Honestly, that's sick, especially for like...

4587
04:35:20,650 --> 04:35:21,910
We didn't practice as much.

4588
04:35:22,210 --> 04:35:26,550
Like, we got a lot to learn, bro.

4589
04:35:27,630 --> 04:35:29,910
Didn't you start your practice like yesterday, Kony?

4590
04:35:30,490 --> 04:35:30,850
Yes.

4591
04:35:31,010 --> 04:35:31,290
Yeah.

4592
04:35:32,550 --> 04:35:34,730
I played a lot in the first round, the first time.

4593
04:35:34,990 --> 04:35:36,370
This time, I'm like, it's day one.

4594
04:35:36,470 --> 04:35:37,110
It's just learning.

4595
04:35:37,510 --> 04:35:39,150
I'm not, you know, I took it.

4596
04:35:39,190 --> 04:35:40,070
I didn't take it as seriously.

4597
04:35:41,950 --> 04:35:43,010
Good shit, guys.

4598
04:35:43,230 --> 04:35:44,310
All right, let's find out what's more.

4599
04:35:45,730 --> 04:35:48,190
Does anyone know how well High Tone did?

4600
04:35:49,250 --> 04:35:49,810
I don't know.

4601
04:35:50,030 --> 04:35:50,550
Is he on stream?

4602
04:35:51,030 --> 04:35:51,710
Yeah, chat.

4603
04:35:52,150 --> 04:35:52,630
Stream Snipe.

4604
04:35:52,950 --> 04:35:54,010
How well did High Tone did?

4605
04:35:59,730 --> 04:36:00,890
Where's my stream snipers?

4606
04:36:01,170 --> 04:36:01,770
3-2?

4607
04:36:02,650 --> 04:36:04,350
You were saying 3-2 in my chat.

4608
04:36:04,810 --> 04:36:05,910
If it's 3-2, then we're first.

4609
04:36:05,930 --> 04:36:08,010
Yeah, we're first because we're 15.

4610
04:36:08,690 --> 04:36:08,770
Wow.

4611
04:36:08,870 --> 04:36:09,770
Was that the last one?

4612
04:36:10,190 --> 04:36:10,670
Yeah, that's it.

4613
04:36:10,890 --> 04:36:11,890
We were on stream for the last one.

4614
04:36:12,210 --> 04:36:12,470
Yeah.

4615
04:36:12,730 --> 04:36:13,570
Oh, cool.

4616
04:36:14,290 --> 04:36:15,070
Yeah, we won.

4617
04:36:15,150 --> 04:36:15,810
We won the day.

4618
04:36:15,910 --> 04:36:16,450
Good shit, fellas.

4619
04:36:17,170 --> 04:36:17,930
Yeah, we did.

4620
04:36:18,350 --> 04:36:19,030
We won the day.

4621
04:36:19,650 --> 04:36:20,150
We won the day.

4622
04:36:20,810 --> 04:36:22,170
Dude, let's fucking go.

4623
04:36:22,490 --> 04:36:22,770
Wow.

4624
04:36:23,270 --> 04:36:27,870
And if people try to download me, I'm only at 1% at my level
right now.

4625
04:36:28,230 --> 04:36:30,290
This is the, I'm posting the scoreboard.

4626
04:36:30,570 --> 04:36:31,130
I don't know.

4627
04:36:31,390 --> 04:36:35,910
It hasn't been updated for KFM or Tone, but it doesn't
matter.

4628
04:36:35,930 --> 04:36:38,190
because they can't reach us.

4629
04:36:39,850 --> 04:36:42,370
High tone, if he went 3-2, is 14 also.

4630
04:36:42,950 --> 04:36:44,030
Yeah, so, and we're 15.

4631
04:36:45,230 --> 04:36:47,630
Yeah, they're probably going to look at, like, match counts
after that.

4632
04:36:50,330 --> 04:36:51,590
Good shit, fellas.

4633
04:36:51,830 --> 04:36:53,290
Yeah, guys, we did it.

4634
04:36:53,550 --> 04:36:53,990
Okay.

4635
04:36:56,510 --> 04:36:59,890
Doki, very proud of you for the two W's, despite no
practice.

4636
04:37:00,030 --> 04:37:00,550
Good shit.

4637
04:37:00,870 --> 04:37:01,930
Yeah, those were electric.

4638
04:37:01,930 --> 04:37:03,490
I beat a red, guys.

4639
04:37:05,930 --> 04:37:07,170
That's a hard-to-be-king player.

4640
04:37:07,650 --> 04:37:08,650
I have a shifter clip.

4641
04:37:09,950 --> 04:37:10,530
Oh, yeah, yeah.

4642
04:37:10,530 --> 04:37:12,050
I have a clip of him rage-quaring.

4643
04:37:12,350 --> 04:37:13,470
George Bush, PNG.

4644
04:37:18,430 --> 04:37:20,650
Sir June has hit a second wall.

4645
04:37:23,090 --> 04:37:25,110
I hit a second wall.

4646
04:37:25,550 --> 04:37:26,090
Hold on.

4647
04:37:26,330 --> 04:37:27,410
Oh, God, dude.

4648
04:37:27,650 --> 04:37:28,390
Here you go, chat.

4649
04:37:39,770 --> 04:37:40,870
That's fucking awesome.

4650
04:37:42,670 --> 04:37:43,070
Dude.

4651
04:37:44,330 --> 04:37:46,670
Dude, there's still 15 more seconds in the clip.

4652
04:37:47,410 --> 04:37:48,790
Oh my god!

4653
04:37:54,450 --> 04:37:56,150
Bro, he's coping so hard!

4654
04:38:02,520 --> 04:38:03,000
Nice.

4655
04:38:03,140 --> 04:38:03,740
That was good, though.

4656
04:38:03,820 --> 04:38:05,100
We got a rage-quick clip and everything.

4657
04:38:05,240 --> 04:38:06,140
That was pretty good.

4658
04:38:06,500 --> 04:38:07,920
I feel him, man.

4659
04:38:07,980 --> 04:38:08,740
I'm on his side.

4660
04:38:08,860 --> 04:38:10,560
Jack looks annoying as shit.

4661
04:38:11,620 --> 04:38:13,460
That looks obnoxious.

4662
04:38:15,340 --> 04:38:17,040
That one combo was ridiculous.

4663
04:38:17,320 --> 04:38:19,340
I don't even...

4664
04:38:19,340 --> 04:38:20,040
Oh, I kept...

4665
04:38:20,040 --> 04:38:20,840
He was coping so hard.

4666
04:38:20,840 --> 04:38:21,920
Wait, did CJM end?

4667
04:38:23,020 --> 04:38:23,960
Yeah, he did.

4668
04:38:24,260 --> 04:38:25,520
Oh, he just ended the stream.

4669
04:38:25,680 --> 04:38:26,000
That's it.

4670
04:38:26,080 --> 04:38:26,920
I mean, we did.

4671
04:38:27,800 --> 04:38:28,740
No, fucking relax.

4672
04:38:28,740 --> 04:38:29,040
All right.

4673
04:38:29,120 --> 04:38:29,540
Take a break.

4674
04:38:29,640 --> 04:38:30,460
That was kind of fast.

4675
04:38:31,140 --> 04:38:31,540
Recuperate.

4676
04:38:32,220 --> 04:38:33,320
All right, fellas, we won.

4677
04:38:33,420 --> 04:38:34,060
Good shit, everybody.

4678
04:38:35,100 --> 04:38:35,380
First day.

4679
04:38:36,060 --> 04:38:37,440
Once again, Raw Pro team on top.

4680
04:38:37,620 --> 04:38:38,940
Throw it back in round two.

4681
04:38:40,160 --> 04:38:46,500
Yeah, so I'm going to drive home and then I can watch review
some of your guys' stuff and we can talk about everything

4682
04:38:46,500 --> 04:38:48,860
like tomorrow or later tonight.

4683
04:38:49,200 --> 04:38:51,100
So we're ready for the day after.

4684
04:38:51,920 --> 04:38:52,120
Yeah.

4685
04:38:52,340 --> 04:38:52,740
Yeah.

4686
04:38:52,920 --> 04:38:56,300
I'm gonna hop in with you and get some, I need some help.

4687
04:38:56,860 --> 04:38:59,840
Yeah, no, and the thing is, it's very easy to identify.

4688
04:39:00,040 --> 04:39:02,780
It's super easy to identify the shortcomings.

4689
04:39:02,940 --> 04:39:03,320
You know what I mean?

4690
04:39:03,660 --> 04:39:07,740
I think we all have extremely easy shit to, like, I don't
know.

4691
04:39:07,860 --> 04:39:09,560
I trust you guys to adapt harder.

4692
04:39:09,720 --> 04:39:10,220
You know what I mean?

4693
04:39:10,340 --> 04:39:12,180
Like, I'm not, I'm confident.

4694
04:39:12,520 --> 04:39:13,300
You guys are sick.

4695
04:39:13,540 --> 04:39:15,220
I mean, Doki only needs to learn mids, does it?

4696
04:39:15,280 --> 04:39:17,380
Yeah, I just need to learn other combos.

4697
04:39:18,280 --> 04:39:18,920
And they're never expected.

4698
04:39:18,920 --> 04:39:20,840
And they hit the leg drop after the kick, you know?

Oh my god, guys!

04:40:17,770 --> 04:40:19,270
We did so well!

4728
04:40:20,010 --> 04:40:23,030
As a baby, we got first place!

4729
04:40:26,610 --> 04:40:38,450
I can't believe it I beat two players I beat a red That man
was 10 rings above me And I knew like two I barely knew what

4730
04:40:38,450 --> 04:40:49,910
combo to be fair I only knew Three moves and I beat A red
and I beat A fellow king main And she's been playing king

4731
04:40:49,910 --> 04:41:07,950
and tech And look far longer than me and i did it while
talking i did it while being distracted guys i wasn't

4732
04:41:07,950 --> 04:41:23,070
focused up i did that with no thoughts in my head it's all
about instincts and and pressing the square They can't

4733
04:41:23,070 --> 04:41:24,230
analyze me!

4734
04:41:24,550 --> 04:41:26,530
I barely have anything to analyze!

4735
04:41:29,270 --> 04:41:32,150
The yadding is channeled into games.

4736
04:41:33,770 --> 04:41:34,390
Oh my god.

4737
04:41:34,490 --> 04:41:39,010
I actually did not expect to win any games at all.

4738
04:41:39,210 --> 04:41:40,750
To be fair, I went in.

4739
04:41:41,010 --> 04:41:42,370
I was so nervous.

4740
04:41:42,930 --> 04:41:44,030
I was so nervous.

4741
04:41:44,250 --> 04:41:45,510
I was so scared.

4742
04:41:46,050 --> 04:41:48,130
I was like, well, I wasn't like scared.

4743
04:41:48,250 --> 04:41:52,010
I was just like, oh, I'm just going in with just to have
fun, Doki.

4744
04:41:52,270 --> 04:41:53,690
Just to have fun.

4745
04:41:53,970 --> 04:41:56,070
There's no way you're going to win any of these matches.

4746
04:41:56,490 --> 04:41:57,550
They're so good.

4747
04:41:57,830 --> 04:41:59,870
Everybody's been grounding longer than me.

4748
04:42:01,090 --> 04:42:03,050
And then I won two.

4749
04:42:03,290 --> 04:42:06,310
And I got a round of SK.

4750
04:42:06,750 --> 04:42:07,830
And that's all that.

4751
04:42:07,970 --> 04:42:08,870
Did I get two rounds?

4752
04:42:08,970 --> 04:42:10,810
I got two rounds off SK.

4753
04:42:11,370 --> 04:42:12,410
I was so happy.

4754
04:42:12,810 --> 04:42:16,710
I don't know if SK if she was like playing nice to me or
anything.

4755
04:42:16,810 --> 04:42:19,790
I don't know if she was like being nice to me in the first
two rounds.

4756
04:42:20,250 --> 04:42:21,930
But like I take those.

4757
04:42:22,270 --> 04:42:27,090

10 to 15.
