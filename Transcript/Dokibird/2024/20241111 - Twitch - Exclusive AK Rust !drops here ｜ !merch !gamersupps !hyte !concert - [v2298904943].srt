1
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,240
Sorry, I pressed the wrong button.

2
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:54,840
Oh, sorry.

3
00:01:54,940 --> 00:02:00,020
I just got out of the shower, so I'm like, extra, like, relaxed right now.

4
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:04,040
Oh my god, I heard myself.

5
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,000
You guys might have heard myself laughing there.

6
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,460
Oh, I forgot to mute.

7
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,380
I forgot to mute my Chrome.

8
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:14,960
Anyway, I just... I got... Okay, so, yeah.

9
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,780
I feel, like, fucking disgusting earlier.

10
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:23,780
So, for those who don't know, I was at dance lessons today for my concert.

11
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,560
That's happening next month.

12
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:31,360
And, like, it was a three-plus-hour session.

13
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:35,300
And I also accidentally doxed myself to this dance t-shirt now.

14
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:37,540
So, both dance t-shirts know who I am now.

15
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:42,240
I fucked up.

16
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:47,980
How did I dox myself, you might ask?

17
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:56,140
Well, so, in Canada, the thing is, in Canada, we have these things, like, to transfer money.

18
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:56,960
We don't have Venmo.

19
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:57,960
We don't use Venmo.

20
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:01,220
You can... We have this thing called e-transfer.

21
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:12,220
And you can e-transfer to, like, electronically transfer money from your bank account to another Canadian bank account's bank account without, like, Venmo.

22
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:13,340
And stuff like that.

23
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:22,680
So, what I... You know, I used my business bank account because, you know, tax write-off.

24
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:29,860
You know, because of tax write-offs.

25
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:33,420
So, because I was like, this is clearly a business expense.

26
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:37,960
What I forgot to do was that I have two business accounts.

27
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:42,240
One is... Name is DokiBird.

28
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,320
The other one is just numbers.

29
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:53,160
I accidentally used the DokiBird account to e-transfer to her.

30
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,600
And then, because, like, I didn't realize she sort of, like...

31
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:01,600
Because, like, that was the last time I, like...

32
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:06,280
Because the other... The first time I paid the lessons, I didn't use that account.

33
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:11,160
But the last time I paid her, I accidentally used the DokiBird account.

34
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,900
So, she was like...

35
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:15,120
Because, like, she was like, alright, yeah, do you need an invoice?

36
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:16,880
And I was like, yeah, I need an invoice.

37
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,360
And she's like, what do you want me to put it as?

38
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,380
Like, DokiBird?

39
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,680
And I... Literally, I was just like...

40
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:29,760
I'm just like...

41
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:40,080
Because I was like...

42
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:48,680
So...

43
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:51,640
No, no, she's young.

44
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,080
I'm pretty sure she googled me.

45
00:04:54,920 --> 00:05:00,660
Because she was like, man, it must be so exhausting to, like, stream all the time.

46
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:02,680
Like, she was, like, having, like, small talk.

47
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:03,720
She's young.

48
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:07,640
You know how... Okay, so, like, she knows, like...

49
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,360
She knows gaming and stuff.

50
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:10,960
She plays League, guys.

51
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,580
She plays Overwatch.

52
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:19,280
Her favorite YouTubers are Slimecicle and Jschlatt.

53
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:21,420
I think she knows now.

54
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:26,220
Okay,

55
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,200
so...

56
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,280
Okay, story time.

57
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:36,540
Um, story time.

58
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:40,720
Anyway, so, when I went to dance lessons today...

59
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:43,860
She was, like, wearing, like, sunglasses.

60
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:46,020
And we're inside, by the way.

61
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,760
So I was like...

62
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:49,320
No, that was not the story.

63
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:51,680
So, like, she was wearing sunglasses.

64
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:55,460
And I was really confused because I was like, why is she wearing sunglasses?

65
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:59,860
And she was also wearing, like, Crocs and pajama pants.

66
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:02,500
So I was like, oh my God, is she hungover?

67
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:05,160
Like, for my dance lessons, for my very...

68
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:09,240
For my last dance lessons before I have to, like, you know, travel to America.

69
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:13,140
And I was just like, oh my God, like, is she hungover?

70
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:18,000
And then, so I was like, what happened?

71
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:20,460
And she's like, I got a concussion two days ago.

72
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:24,580
And so, I was just like...

73
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:26,360
What?

74
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:26,780
And...

75
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:32,800
She's like, yeah, I got a concussion two days ago.

76
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,680
And I was like, wait, why?

77
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:36,980
I'm just, like, thinking, like, why are you here?

78
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:39,020
Like, why are you working?

79
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:43,580
And so, yeah, because she had, like, a performance two days ago.

80
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:50,000
And she apparently, not even while she was performing, it was when she was gonna grab her stuff.

81
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:58,160
And basically, she was like, she apparently tripped over a bag and then slammed into the window.

82
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:01,500
Like, the bottom of the window.

83
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,740
And then, so she had a concussion.

84
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:09,460
And then, so then... But then, she went to work the next day.

85
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,900
And she's like, yeah, anyway, I went to rehearsal yesterday.

86
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:19,760
Like, I, you know, I had to wear sunglasses while doing the dance rehearsal and stuff like that.

87
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:22,200
Because the lights were starting to get... Were too bright.

88
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:23,780
So I knew I had, like, a concussion.

89
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:29,280
And then, I was like, wait, did you went to the photo shoot for your dance?

90
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,780
And she was like, yeah, I did.

91
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:33,300
And I had to, like, put on makeup on some of the girls and stuff.

92
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:35,580
Like, the day after her concussion!

93
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,280
And I was like...

94
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,420
I was like, am I...

95
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,800
Am I misunderstanding what concussion is?

96
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:46,100
I'm just, like, thinking in my head.

97
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,220
I'm like...

98
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:51,100
Do I just not know what concussions are?

99
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:54,420
I thought, you know, you'd be in the hospital.

100
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:58,360
Or, like, you know.

101
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,540
And she's like, well, I gotta work, you know.

102
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,420
Like, I still have to work and...

103
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:07,620
I didn't... Like, the dance teacher... Like, I was like, this is the dance teacher?

104
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,960
Like, your dance coach knows you have a concussion?

105
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:14,880
And she was like, yeah, he was there when you saw me hit my head.

106
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:18,660
I'm just like, oh my god!

107
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:20,020
I'm just...

108
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:22,560
Anyway...

109
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:27,440
But, like, you know, he saw me with my sunglasses and he, like...

110
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:31,320
He, like, closed the lights for me, for my dance practice.

111
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,440
For me during our rehearsal.

112
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,460
So it was, like, really nice that he did that.

113
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,600
And I was like, I felt like... I was just thinking, like...

114
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,340
I was like, why didn't you...

115
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:42,180
Why didn't you...

116
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:44,440
I was just thinking, like...

117
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,700
I'm just, like...

118
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:46,820
Like, why...

119
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,900
Why didn't you go?

120
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:50,400
Why didn't he send you home?

121
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,520
And she's just like, yeah, like...

122
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,540
Like, you know...

123
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:56,680
You know, I can't just miss the rehearsal.

124
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:59,720
Since, like, I still have to know the set and everything.

125
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:00,780
It's wasting time.

126
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,820
It's, like, wasting the entire team's time.

127
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,220
I'm like, oh my god!

128
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:07,100
And then, so...

129
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:08,820
So, it's because...

130
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:09,820
You know how...

131
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,860
She canceled the lesson yesterday because I was in Minecraft?

132
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:14,480
So...

133
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:18,300
So, she canceled the lesson yesterday because I was in Minecraft.

134
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:20,440
And she was telling me how...

135
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:23,720
Oh, yeah, like, you know, after I waited for, like...

136
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:28,220
Like, an hour, I figured to just leave so I could go to my rehearsal yesterday.

137
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,640
And, like, you know...

138
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,560
Make sure that I'm okay.

139
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:36,300
Like, you know, just get myself ready mentally with this concussion for my rehearsal.

140
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:39,000
Just because, like, you know, I have to, you know...

141
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,660
Because, like, you know, I have a headache and everything.

142
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:41,840
And, like, lights are too bright.

143
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:47,860
So, I just wanted to make sure I'm, like, mentally prepared for the back-to-back rehearsals on that yesterday.

144
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:50,340
I was just, like, what the fuck?

145
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:55,180
So, I'm just thinking, like...

146
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:59,480
You have a concussion?

147
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:01,160
Like, that's all I could think.

148
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,880
I was just, like, all I could think was, like...

149
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,960
You have a concussion?

150
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:12,380
And after, you know, and then...

151
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:15,380
And then, like, during...

152
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:17,420
Like, after the dance lessons, she's, like...

153
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:22,880
She was telling me, like, Oh, yeah, I'm gonna be heading to my Magic the Gathering group later after this lesson.

154
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:27,520
And I was, like, you can still play Magic the Gathering after this?

155
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:29,520
Like...

156
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:32,780
I'm just...

157
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:39,240
I'm just, like, what do you mean you're gonna go play Magic the Gathering after this?

158
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:43,360
She was telling me, like, she has, like, a headache.

159
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:49,100
And, like, she fucking slammed her head against the bottom of the windowsill.

160
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,160
You know, like, the little...

161
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,280
The bump at the bottom of the...

162
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:55,420
Yeah, so...

163
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:59,520
Yeah, and then she was, like, Yeah, but, like, I organized this, like, you know, we have a group chat.

164
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:02,200
And usually, we play on Sunday and everything.

165
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:08,620
So, yeah, like, you know, I am heading over to play Magic the Gathering right after this lesson.

166
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:09,300
And I'm just...

167
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:14,360
She was, like, telling me how she has a headache and, like, she's getting dizzy while doing some of the moves and everything.

168
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:20,320
And I'm, like, and you're gonna play fucking Magic the Gathering?

169
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,000
So, um...

170
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,600
That's my...

171
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,560
That's my, uh, story time for today.

172
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:32,240
I...

173
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,600
Anyway, I was, like, so mentally done after the lesson.

174
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,040
I was so fucking tired.

175
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:39,860
But, uh, I forgot to realize that, uh...

176
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:44,620
I realized that, like, when I got home after lessons, uh...

177
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:48,520
I forgot to buy, like, essential stuff for traveling.

178
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:52,720
So, I couldn't go to the shower right away.

179
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,860
So, I had to, like, uh...

180
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:55,900
Oh, I missed story time.

181
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,440
Don't worry, because we're on Twitch, you can actually rewatch VODs, by the way.

182
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:02,640
So, like, lucky for you, we're on Twitch for today.

183
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:05,680
So, you can go back to click the VOD and rewatch story time.

184
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:13,780
Um, so, like, I had to go out and buy, like, you know, a microphone and everything and, like, travel stuff.

185
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,680
Um, because, like, I don't...

186
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,920
I don't have time to unpack as well.

187
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,120
Like, I don't know if I packed my other microphone that I used for, uh...

188
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,560
I don't know if I packed my old microphone that I used when I used to travel.

189
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:28,360
So, then I'm, like, um...

190
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:28,800
I might as...

191
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:29,980
I'll just buy a new one.

192
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:31,200
Just because, like, I don't have...

193
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:31,660
I don't know.

194
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:34,160
There's, like, 15 plus boxes.

195
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:36,720
And I don't have time to unpack that.

196
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:41,120
So, I bought some, like, travel stuff.

197
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,660
Um, some travel stuff for myself.

198
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:44,860
Uh, just for...

199
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:46,000
Just for...

200
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,520
Uh, just because, like, uh...

201
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,300
You know, I don't know if I have any of these things.

202
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:51,300
So...

203
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:51,880
Uh, yeah.

204
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:54,700
I was shopping when I asked for a microphone.

205
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:57,040
Because, like, I was heading there anyway.

206
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:58,660
So, I was just, like, alright.

207
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:00,780
Let's see what...

208
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:03,660
Let's see what I can get that's in this store right now.

209
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,300
So, yeah.

210
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:08,060
And I grabbed...

211
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:09,680
I grabbed, uh...

212
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,720
I grabbed, like, dinner on back...

213
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,620
On the way back.

214
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:13,840
And then I went to take a shower.

215
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:15,560
Because I felt fucking disgusting.

216
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:16,140
You know?

217
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,880
Right after dance lessons, I couldn't shower right away.

218
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,960
And it was, like, three hours of dancing.

219
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,880
So, I was just, like...

220
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:23,360
Um...

221
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,500
I was just, like, oh, fuck.

222
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:25,280
I need a...

223
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,580
I need...

224
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:28,000
Because, like...

225
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:28,460
A lot...

226
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:29,540
It's Sunday, too.

227
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:31,280
It's the worst day to be shopping.

228
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:32,140
It's Sunday.

229
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:33,240
Like...

230
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:33,780
I don't...

231
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:34,200
And I know...

232
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:37,040
I know I don't have time to buy equipment stuff tomorrow.

233
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,320
So, I was just, like...

234
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:38,900
Oh, my God.

235
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:39,560
It's Sunday.

236
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:40,860
Oh, fuck.

237
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:41,180
Okay.

238
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:41,880
I...

239
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,320
I need to get there before...

240
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,180
Before places close.

241
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:46,740
Um...

242
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:47,720
Anyway, I was...

243
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,120
Um...

244
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:51,040
I, like, fucking hibernated so hard yesterday.

245
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:51,680
I think, like...

246
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,240
I was, like, I'm gonna take a nap.

247
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,820
Even though I know I have, like, a lot of stuff to do.

248
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:56,480
I was, like, I'm gonna take a nap.

249
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:58,260
I'm gonna take a nap.

250
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:01,140
And I think I slept, like, 10 plus...

251
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:03,880
Like, I slept all the way till my dance lesson.

252
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:07,420
And then, I was so fucking mentally...

253
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:08,400
I was, like, when...

254
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:12,320
Like, during the lessons, the teacher was, like, Are you okay?

255
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:16,980
Cause I was staring at the wall for, like, 30 seconds.

256
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:18,980
During one...

257
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:20,100
During the middle of it.

258
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:21,840
Like, before I...

259
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:24,020
Before we were gonna do another run.

260
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:26,480
I was just, you know, like, wore PTSD.

261
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,220
I was just, like...

262
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:33,820
And the teacher was, like, Are you okay?

263
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:37,000
And I'm just, like, Sorry, I was disassociating.

264
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:43,480
Oh, my God.

265
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,240
I'm okay, by the way.

266
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:48,440
I was just mentally so tired by then.

267
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:49,780
I was, like...

268
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:50,340
Oh, my God.

269
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:52,020
Yesterday was just a lot.

270
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:52,720
Anyway.

271
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:53,660
So.

272
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,660
Why am I doing gorilla...

273
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:56,740
Uh...

274
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:58,000
Isn't it great, guys?

275
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:00,820
The best part is that I'm already in the rust category.

276
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:01,700
So, with...

277
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:04,760
So, even though rust is not up on my...

278
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,220
Up on the screen right now.

279
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:09,680
You're still getting the AK at the moment.

280
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:11,820
The AK...

281
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:14,020
It still adds on to the AK.

282
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:22,200
Huge shout-out for Sakuno for fucking grinding the drops for me.

283
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:25,680
It was just very poor timing from my end.

284
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:26,260
Anyway.

285
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,160
Also, uh...

286
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,100
Oh, my God.

287
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,720
Shout-out to Twitch Prime.

288
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:32,020
Thank you.

289
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:32,720
Thank you.

290
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:33,800
So.

291
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,120
For those who don't know.

292
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:39,780
I have an exclusive AK rust drop.

293
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:40,840
Uh...

294
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:41,680
And...

295
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:42,280
Uh...

296
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:46,000
I shall try to stream at least two hours.

297
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:47,320
I don't know.

298
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:50,420
Because, like, I know Gumi is not online today.

299
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:52,080
Because she's actually traveling as well.

300
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:55,480
So, she's, like, busy doing whatever Gumi does.

301
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:56,400
Um...

302
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,420
When she's not streaming.

303
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,300
So, it's solo hours for me.

304
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,100
So, it's a little intimidating.

305
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:04,280
Um...

306
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:06,500
Because I'm by myself this time.

307
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:07,680
And...

308
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:07,960
Um...

309
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:08,820
You know...

310
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:10,320
That's...

311
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,540
It's, like, a little intimidating.

312
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,220
Because I'm by myself.

313
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:14,020
And I'm like...

314
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:15,680
What do I do?

315
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:20,760
Mmm...

316
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,340
Interaction is scary.

317
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:23,620
Um...

318
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:27,340
But yes, all you have to do is watch until...

319
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:31,180
Watch until, you know, you get your drop.

320
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,440
Or stay after you get your drop.

321
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,600
It's really up to...

322
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,520
It's up to you.

323
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:37,840
Um...

324
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,180
So that's why I'm doing Guru's stream.

325
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:39,920
Because, you know.

326
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:41,960
It's a very...

327
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,520
It's a very...

328
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:45,660
It's always a great opportunity to show, like...

329
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:58,640
It's a very, you know, fortunate position to be in to be part of the Exclusive streamer rush drop because not a lot of streamers get picked for this So I was like, all right, I got it.

330
00:16:58,740 --> 00:16:59,280
I got it.

331
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,760
You know, at least stream more than Kai Sinat.

332
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:02,560

333
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:06,060

I just thought it was funny

337
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:25,180
That's like my goal is to make sure I at least do more rust hours

338
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:39,560
I just I felt really bad because I was like, oh this is it's so hard to get bit like, you know There's such a great.

I hope my laptop can run rust.

342
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:14,900
If not, I don't know I don't know.

There is only... he is the chosen one, Toki.

467
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:17,060
You don't understand.

468
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:24,160
I have... I have... I have zero context here.

469
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:27,100
But we must protect 10.

470
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:35,340
Oh my god.

471
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:40,020
For 10, we must protect...

472
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:49,360
And no one else has 10.

473
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:55,300
And 10 we trust.

474
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:56,880
Wait, I should get a weapon.

475
00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:57,440
You're right.

476
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:59,280
What darkness do we need?

477
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:02,540
We have so many people fighting for 10!

478
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:04,380
Like...

479
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:06,340
Wait, did you die?

480
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:13,760
Better off 10, like...

00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:16,100
Okay, I gotta know what changed in our world.

Like, what...

483
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:18,660
Like, I felt like...

484
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,560
Nothing's the same anymore.

485
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,480
Nothing's the same.

486
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:28,860
Everything is new and I'm so afraid.

487
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:33,080
I need to find the lore master.

488
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:35,820
The 10 lore master.

489
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:39,820
This is the time skip arc.

490
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:44,540
This is the time skip that I fucking missed out on.

491
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:49,060
I'm just gonna check.

492
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:50,960
Okay, the check on stuff.

493
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:53,480
Oh man.

494
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,960
Yeah, I'm trying to see, like, what's changed.

495
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,060
What's new?

496
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,600
I feel like I was in a coma.

497
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,940
And, like, we time skipped.

498
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:06,040
I know you've been in a coma, but...

499
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,380
Okay, whoa, whoa, relax, okay?

500
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:09,160
You were in a coma, okay?

501
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:09,860
Just breathe.

502
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:14,160
It's like we're in different clothes now.

503
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:17,100
Like, we were, like, simple vikings.

504
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,940
Are we even still vikings?

505
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,580
Like, what are we?

506
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:24,020
Yo, breathe.

507
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,580
Take it slow, okay?

508
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,960
Don't panic, okay?

509
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:29,520
Don't panic.

510
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:32,480
A lot has happened.

511
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:35,820
Take it slow.

512
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:38,260
Breathe in, breathe out.

513
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:39,580
One more time.

514
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:44,640
Still the same, man.

515
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:46,460
Are we?

516
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:47,540
You ended up in a coma.

517
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:48,080
What happened?

518
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:48,520
Are we?

519
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:49,600
I don't know.

520
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:51,060
I closed my eyes.

521
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:54,040
And then, it's like, everything's different.

522
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,240
We had one house.

523
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:01,360
Oh, boy.

524
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:02,080
Oh, boy.

525
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:02,620
What happened?

526
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:04,500
Listen, that's a long story.

527
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,900
How many wars has there been?

528
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:11,140
Come with me.

529
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,260
Don't come with me.

530
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:20,100
Come with me.

531
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,940
Come with him, Lord Master.

532
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:25,320
What the fuck?

533
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:26,760
Wait, there's Ted.

534
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,320
Wait, is that the Ted?

535
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:30,200
Is that him?

536
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:31,880
Is he Ted?

537
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:33,420
Ted, Ted, come with me.

538
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:33,620
Come.

539
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:35,420
Come, come, come, come.

540
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:39,700
Mateo, what's going on?

541
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:41,860
Hey, guys.

542
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:44,400
That's the guy I'm supposed to protect?

543
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:47,460
You're the guy we're supposed to protect?

544
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:50,640
Come up here.

545
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:52,380
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

546
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:53,340
What are you trying to say, man?

547
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:57,400
You know, when everybody was telling me to, like...

548
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:57,940
Sit down, sit down.

549
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:03,080
To protect Ted, you know, I had a different image of who Ted is.

550
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,500
Come on, man.

551
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:10,600
I had a different image of Ted.

552
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,440
Just turn off your torch.

553
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:17,800
Alright, listen, Toki.

554
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:18,460
Okay.

555
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:24,100
You know, a lot has happened since, you know, what is it, the past three days.

556
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:33,660
But all you can know for now, the reason Ted is being wanted and why they want him back so bad is because he used to be one of them.

557
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:35,860
One of who?

558
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:38,980
Who are you part of?

559
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:41,300
The people that just...

560
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:43,060
I was part of the House of Awaken.

561
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:45,420
The House of Awaken?

562
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:48,380
Yeah.

563
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:50,600
Wait, why did you leave?

564
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,220
Because they wanted to be with Dakin.

565
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:06,400
They just wanted to be with Dakin.

566
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:12,340
Now that they've realized what they've lost, they want him back.

567
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:15,020
And they want him back in blood.

568
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:20,580
And they're willing, you guys, they're willing to kill hundreds of innocent people for you?

569
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:24,700
What the...

570
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,660
Dakin, she's making fun of you, man.

571
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:32,500
No, I'm not, I just...

572
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:34,500
I'm not, no, no, no, no, no, I'm not making...

573
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:34,760
Are you jealous?

574
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:36,640
No, I'm not making fun of him.

575
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:37,780
No, I'm just saying.

576
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:39,260
I'm just saying.

577
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:41,080
You are the chosen one.

578
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:42,820
I'm just like...

579
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:43,900
I'm just saying.

580
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:44,880
Look, I just...

581
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:47,980
I never met the Ted before, so I need context here.

582
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,760
Like, I just need to know, like...

583
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:52,520
Why are they...

584
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:55,000
Why is the House of whatever...

585
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:55,380
What's his name?

586
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:56,140
What is the...

587
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:56,420
Awaken?

588
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,240
Listen, Doki.

589
00:36:58,860 --> 00:36:59,440
Listen, Doki.

590
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:00,600
Listen, listen.

591
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,000
I'm the general.

592
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:03,400
I'm the lord.

593
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,740
Of this community.

594
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,320
When I tell you...

595
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,900
You gotta throw your body in front of Ted.

596
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,080
What are you gonna do?

597
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,720
I throw my body in front of Ted.

598
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:17,020
Exactly, exactly.

599
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:19,780
Just know he's a very valuable person.

600
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:21,520
That's gonna be very important later on.

601
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,160
That's all I can tell for now.

602
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:25,680
That's why I want him back.

603
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:27,540
I just realized what I've lost.

604
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,740
Oh my god.

605
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:30,800
He's worth more than a million scrap.

606
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:33,420
You're worth more than a million scrap?

607
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:37,100
Okay, okay, okay.

608
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:38,420
Now I sort of...

609
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:38,740
Okay.

610
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:39,740
No, no.

611
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:40,420
I'm just...

612
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:41,280
I was shocked.

613
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:42,820
I was just shocked there.

614
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:45,080
I never thought I'd see...

615
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:47,260
No, I'm just saying.

616
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:49,160
I've never seen a million...

617
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:51,760
I've never seen a million scrap before.

618
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:54,360
So it blew my mind that that was a number.

619
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:55,460
I'm jealous, huh?

620
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,080
You got one sibling?

621
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:01,520
You like the little...

622
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,900
You like the sibling that's always jealous.

623
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:05,500
No, I'm just...

624
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:07,320
Look, I was gone for so long.

625
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:09,420
And then I got like...

626
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:11,300
Everything is different and new.

627
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,380
And now we have Christmas lights.

628
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:18,840
Look, I...

629
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:23,180
Just...

630
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:23,620
Yeah.

631
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:26,000
It's okay.

632
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:26,880
It's a lot to take in.

633
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,900
I've been sleeping for three days.

634
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:31,500
So it's a lot to take in.

635
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:32,100
I get it.

636
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:32,820
I get it, honestly.

637
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:34,540
I wish I could sleep for three days.

638
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:35,720
Okay.

639
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:42,140
Okay, so...

640
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:42,940
So like...

641
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:43,800
Please sit down.

642
00:38:50,470 --> 00:38:51,530
Any more questions?

643
00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:52,210
Any more questions?

644
00:38:54,370 --> 00:38:54,770
So...

645
00:38:57,130 --> 00:38:57,930
So like...

646
00:38:57,930 --> 00:39:00,490
Is it only that house that's looking for Ted?

647
00:39:01,870 --> 00:39:04,950
Or are the other houses also want Ted?

648
00:39:07,130 --> 00:39:10,210
No, I think it's mostly them for now because they used to have him.

649
00:39:10,850 --> 00:39:11,130
Okay.

650
00:39:12,270 --> 00:39:14,410
Okay, and how...

651
00:39:14,410 --> 00:39:15,150
And...

652
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:18,170
Because no one knows really the real value of that guy.

653
00:39:18,430 --> 00:39:18,930
So like...

654
00:39:19,450 --> 00:39:20,710
How long has this war been?

655
00:39:21,610 --> 00:39:23,310
How long has this war lasted?

656
00:39:25,470 --> 00:39:26,990
Okay, you might not believe it.

657
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:28,330
But it just started.

658
00:39:29,570 --> 00:39:32,450
Like, you just got on probably and it just happened.

659
00:39:33,710 --> 00:39:35,690
So I woke up to war.

660
00:39:36,610 --> 00:39:38,930
I woke up to the Great Ted War.

661
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:39,770
Some might say...

662
00:39:39,770 --> 00:39:40,550
Wait a minute.

663
00:39:41,570 --> 00:39:43,390
Wait, the Great Ted War?

664
00:39:44,270 --> 00:39:45,270
Yeah, some might say.

665
00:39:45,430 --> 00:39:46,150
Some might say.

666
00:39:47,030 --> 00:39:48,310
You can call it that.

667
00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:50,950
I just literally woke up and got drafted.

668
00:39:50,950 --> 00:39:51,410
Like...

669
00:39:55,570 --> 00:39:57,970
Drafted into the Great Ted War.

670
00:40:01,470 --> 00:40:03,990
So who's in the house of...

671
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:05,690
The other house?

672
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:06,410
Who's in there?

673
00:40:13,650 --> 00:40:14,030
Oh!

674
00:40:14,450 --> 00:40:15,230
Oh, fuck.

675
00:40:15,350 --> 00:40:15,670
Okay.

676
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:16,570
Okay.

677
00:40:18,070 --> 00:40:18,830
Okay.

678
00:40:18,830 --> 00:40:19,770
Okay.

679
00:40:21,230 --> 00:40:22,030
And...

680
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:22,450
Alright.

681
00:40:22,730 --> 00:40:24,830
Okay, I think I got enough context now.

682
00:40:25,530 --> 00:40:28,310
I think I have enough context.

683
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:35,060
What?

684
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:38,900
What happened?

685
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:45,780
Was it for her?

686
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:48,760
Was it for her?

687
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:52,420
Wait, for like, love life.

688
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,180
I thought you said you have a love life.

689
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,040
Or for him.

690
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:55,980
You know, I don't judge.

691
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:56,980
Was it for him?

692
00:40:57,900 --> 00:40:58,540
Was it for Ted?

693
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:05,600
He left his house for you.

694
00:41:13,870 --> 00:41:15,670
He left his house for you.

695
00:41:15,770 --> 00:41:16,290
Wasn't that...

696
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:23,680
Okay.

697
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,420
Who left what?

698
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:26,360
I said, Ted.

699
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:27,960
Didn't Ted leave his house for you?

700
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:33,860
Oh, okay.

701
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:37,380
Okay.

702
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:38,100
Okay.

703
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:55,360
He took his nap.

704
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:56,380
I still haven't woken up.

705
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:57,740
But...

706
00:41:57,740 --> 00:42:00,860
He said he wanted to see it tomorrow, which was today.

707
00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:04,400
But I also told Janet that I made this room for her.

708
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:05,340
Oh!

709
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:06,880
And she also wants to see it today.

710
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:07,500
Right?

711
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:08,980
So...

712
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:09,540
Boom.

713
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:11,000
I'm in a dilemma, right?

714
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:12,200
Okay, yeah, yeah.

715
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:13,900
I promised two people that I made a special room.

716
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:14,940
Right?

717
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:18,140
I made a special room, which is the same room.

718
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:19,140
Yeah.

719
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:20,960
You know what any other normal person would do?

720
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,160
What would they do?

721
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:26,260
Make the exact same house.

722
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:29,720
So I have two of the exact same house with the exact same room.

723
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:31,120
Wait, what?

724
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:34,080
Like I have both of them, or like each of them in each house.

725
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:36,440
But what if they come to each of the house at the same time?

726
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:37,240
What you gonna do?

727
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:39,900
No, no, no.

728
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:40,240
It won't happen.

729
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:40,960
So, look, look.

730
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:42,220
So, you see this?

731
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:42,580
Yeah.

732
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:43,800
The fireplace?

733
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:44,660
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

734
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:45,800
Come with me.

735
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:45,880
Come with me.

736
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:56,860
He made the exact same house for two different people.

737
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:03,860
I'm just thinking the amount of time.

738
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:06,020
Wait, is this the other one?

739
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:09,700
Oh, it's unfinished.

740
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:12,360
What the fuck?

741
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:13,380
How the fuck do I...

742
00:43:13,380 --> 00:43:13,880
Just jump, jump.

743
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:14,480
Oh, jump here.

744
00:43:14,580 --> 00:43:14,740
Okay.

745
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:15,980
You don't need to...

746
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:16,240
Okay.

747
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:19,180
Oh, shit.

748
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,180
This is trippy.

749
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:23,840
Okay, this is pretty trippy.

750
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:33,380
So, which one is Janet's place and which one is Foolish's place?

751
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:36,560
This one is Foolish.

752
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:37,860
This one is for Foolish?

753
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:38,720
This is the original one.

754
00:43:38,860 --> 00:43:39,440
The OG?

755
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:40,080
Okay.

756
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:43,260
Wait, then why is the other one better?

757
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:47,400
Why is the other one more well-built?

758
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:51,800
Because I'm a changed man now.

759
00:43:51,980 --> 00:43:56,040
Oh, so you're trying to say Janet is a higher tier than Foolish.

760
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:56,700
No, no, no.

761
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:58,360
So you care about her more than him.

762
00:43:58,480 --> 00:43:59,020
That's what I'm saying.

763
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:01,000
No, no, no, no, no, no.

764
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:02,300
Now you're putting just word in my mouth.

765
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:03,000
Yeah, okay, okay.

766
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:04,200
I'm on my winter arc now.

767
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:05,420
Okay, okay, okay.

768
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:06,600
I'm not proceeding love anymore.

769
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:08,420
I need to love myself first.

770
00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:10,880
Oh, so you already broke up with him.

771
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:12,140
I've called it off.

772
00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:15,740
Oh, so what are you going to do with these two houses now?

773
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:19,040
I'm not sure yet.

774
00:44:19,140 --> 00:44:20,380
I mean, this is Foolish's house.

775
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:21,740
He's living downstairs.

776
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:25,260
Oh, so he took the house in the divorce.

777
00:44:25,420 --> 00:44:25,760
I see.

778
00:44:28,340 --> 00:44:30,760
I mean, originally it was his.

779
00:44:30,980 --> 00:44:34,060
I just, you know, I just moved in.

780
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:34,780
Oh, there he is.

781
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:37,000
Wow.

782
00:44:38,580 --> 00:44:41,480
He's got one house, guys.

783
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:44,100
Foolish took the house in the divorce.

784
00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:46,540
What do you think?

785
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:50,800
Wait, who said that?

786
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:51,900
Hello?

787
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:56,400
Hi, I got some of your stuff.

788
00:44:56,900 --> 00:44:57,840
Here's your phone.

789
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:00,040
Oh, thank you very much.

790
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:03,600
Now he's just laughing.

791
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:08,280
You're fighting for him?

792
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:10,700
Look at him!

793
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:14,240
They stole your phone, Tete.

794
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:21,540
This is the guy I'm supposed to put my body on line for?

795
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:25,200
Look at him!

796
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:32,580
Gentlemen, gentlemen, gentlemen, gentlemen.

797
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:32,960
Hello?

798
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:33,940
What's up?

799
00:45:34,540 --> 00:45:35,600
Who is this?

800
00:45:35,740 --> 00:45:37,220
I just want to make sure they're doing okay.

801
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:44,660
Me at the rock.

802
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:46,260
Hello?

803
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:47,700
Why do you have Tete's phone?

804
00:45:48,460 --> 00:45:49,500
Why do you have Tete's phone?

805
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:50,320
Be ready.

806
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:53,480
I don't, you know...

807
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:58,220
Wait, I don't have any arrows or a bow.

808
00:45:58,400 --> 00:45:59,800
I don't speak London, what are you saying?

809
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:01,760
Everything is over here.

810
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:02,260
Oh, okay.

811
00:46:03,100 --> 00:46:05,200
I don't speak London.

812
00:46:07,620 --> 00:46:10,600
Everything that you need is all in two chests.

813
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:11,180
Okay.

814
00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:16,440
I mean, I remember when I went to bed and we had one house.

815
00:46:16,580 --> 00:46:17,700
If you need more, uh...

816
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:23,660
If you need more sleeping bags, there's also more in there too.

817
00:46:23,740 --> 00:46:24,340
Okay, okay.

818
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:25,600
You're gonna need it to...

819
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:27,600
You're gonna need...

820
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:31,640
Oh, this house?

821
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:32,360
The golden chest?

822
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:33,820
Two chests right in front of you.

823
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:34,580
Okay.

824
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:35,480
Where are the arrows?

825
00:46:35,860 --> 00:46:36,920
Oh, is it in the other chest?

826
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:38,860
Right here.

827
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:42,560
I took it back.

828
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:43,200
Okay, okay.

829
00:46:43,220 --> 00:46:44,300
I got the arrows.

830
00:46:46,260 --> 00:46:47,920
Oh my god, what the fuck?

831
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:53,160
Arrows, bandages, swords, bows, armor, sleeping bags...

832
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:55,040
What the fuck happened?

833
00:46:55,620 --> 00:46:56,340
What the...

834
00:46:56,340 --> 00:46:57,680
What the fuck?

835
00:46:57,920 --> 00:46:59,680
What happened?

836
00:46:59,740 --> 00:47:00,600
Oh, if you need food...

837
00:47:01,140 --> 00:47:01,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

838
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:01,980
Where's the food?

839
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:05,300
Right here.

840
00:47:05,580 --> 00:47:06,120
Okay, okay.

841
00:47:06,140 --> 00:47:06,660
I got it.

842
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:07,380
I got it.

843
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:08,700
And water.

844
00:47:09,340 --> 00:47:09,780
I just...

845
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:10,400
Easy.

846
00:47:14,580 --> 00:47:15,870
I fucking...

847
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:18,740
I thought it would be the simple life.

848
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:22,420
I thought we were living the simple life.

849
00:47:23,060 --> 00:47:25,060
This is no longer simple.

850
00:47:25,700 --> 00:47:29,900
This is no longer the simple life anymore.

851
00:47:30,940 --> 00:47:32,850
This is no longer...

852
00:47:34,900 --> 00:47:37,980
I don't even think we're vikings anymore.

853
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:39,900
Wait, what is this picture?

854
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:40,760
Listen, man.

855
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:41,200
Alright?

856
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:41,360
Listen.

857
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:43,940
Listen, man.

858
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:44,180
Alright?

859
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:50,060
There's always gonna be one thing that we always have that no one else has.

860
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:51,120
We have like...

861
00:47:55,820 --> 00:47:57,120
We have like...

862
00:47:57,920 --> 00:47:59,680
The scouting area?

863
00:48:01,060 --> 00:48:01,580
We...

864
00:48:01,580 --> 00:48:02,120
We got to find it.

865
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:02,880
Nobody else has.

866
00:48:04,260 --> 00:48:07,720
I'm now part of the kingdom of Ted?

867
00:48:07,780 --> 00:48:09,560
What is that?

868
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:12,200
What the fuck?

869
00:48:18,540 --> 00:48:21,180
I remember when we were just vikings.

870
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:23,980
I remember...

871
00:48:26,460 --> 00:48:29,360
I remember when we were...

872
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:30,980
From Odin to Ted.

873
00:48:32,220 --> 00:48:33,700
Things changed.

874
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:36,720
And then I fucking woke up.

875
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:38,700
I woke up to...

876
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:44,280
I woke up to get drafted for a war that I didn't even want to be part of.

877
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:47,460
You guys all saw Ted!

878
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:51,420
I'm supposed to fight for...

879
00:48:51,420 --> 00:48:54,460
I'm supposed to give my life to that guy?

880
00:48:54,460 --> 00:48:55,660
I...

881
00:49:00,220 --> 00:49:01,820
Wait, what are you trying to say, Dokiha?

882
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:02,920
You don't like Ted?

883
00:49:03,180 --> 00:49:03,880
Is that what...

884
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:07,460
All I'm saying is that when I...

885
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:09,960
When I was...

886
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:12,280
When I was told...

887
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:13,600
Of like...

888
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:16,460
A man we're fighting for today...

889
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:18,560
I...

890
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:22,940
I had a different vision of what Ted would look like.

891
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:28,000
I...

892
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:32,060
I had a very different vision of Ted.

893
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:34,880
It was...

894
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:36,720
Like, I'm just saying...

895
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:38,900
This was not who I thought Ted would be.

896
00:49:39,180 --> 00:49:41,440
This was absolutely...

897
00:49:42,860 --> 00:49:45,220
Never meet your...

898
00:49:45,220 --> 00:49:47,920
Never meet your heroes, Doki.

899
00:49:48,380 --> 00:49:50,140
What's that down there?

900
00:49:51,220 --> 00:49:52,340
He's blue once he talks.

901
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,080
What's going on?

902
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:11,740
What?

903
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:13,920
What's going on?

904
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:19,320
Finally someone with a higher IQ than a door.

905
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:21,760
Finally.

906
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:27,220
Yeah, the other guy that had the phone, he wasn't...

907
00:50:27,220 --> 00:50:27,980
He wasn't the brightest.

908
00:50:29,420 --> 00:50:31,260
All he was doing was like making noise.

909
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:31,760
I don't know.

910
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:32,600
I couldn't understand.

911
00:50:38,170 --> 00:50:40,990
What the fuck is going on?

912
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:45,270
What?

913
00:50:58,100 --> 00:50:59,140
What is...

914
00:50:59,140 --> 00:51:00,640
What is going on?

915
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:01,740
Anyway, I gotta head over.

916
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:03,740
It would be funny if I killed Ted.

917
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:05,320
It would be very funny.

918
00:51:06,020 --> 00:51:07,100
I feel like...

919
00:51:07,820 --> 00:51:10,200
What makes Ted... I'm not jealous, guys.

920
00:51:10,420 --> 00:51:11,720
I'm not jealous of Ted.

921
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:14,080
I'm just saying, like...

922
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:17,300
He's not even...

923
00:51:18,100 --> 00:51:23,280
He's not even like... He wasn't even part of the group on day one.

924
00:51:23,660 --> 00:51:24,020
Guys.

925
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:28,040
He wasn't even part of the group on day one.

926
00:51:28,340 --> 00:51:29,340
I'm not jealous.

927
00:51:30,060 --> 00:51:33,100
He's not... He was not... He wasn't even from here.

928
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:35,840
He wasn't even from here.

929
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:42,380
Where is everybody?

930
00:51:42,580 --> 00:51:43,420
Wait, where is everybody?

931
00:51:47,340 --> 00:51:50,260
Ted is... You just met him!

932
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:51,720
Guys!

933
00:51:52,380 --> 00:51:53,960
You just met Ted!

934
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:06,860
Now we want to protect him.

935
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
I can't believe it, guys.

936
00:52:17,540 --> 00:52:18,780
God, if I see Ted...

937
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:21,180
It would be a shame if there was an accident.

938
00:52:21,180 --> 00:52:21,320
It would be a shame if there was an accident.

939
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:30,400
Yeah, no.

940
00:52:30,660 --> 00:52:33,100
Dakin filled me in on...

941
00:52:33,100 --> 00:52:34,220
Yeah, no.

942
00:52:34,300 --> 00:52:36,300
Dakin told me about the great Ted war.

943
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:41,280
So, like...

944
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:42,600
So, like...

945
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,220
Are we gonna... Are we gonna get invaded?

946
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:49,480
Like, are we...

947
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:51,120
What happened?

948
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:53,480
How did Ted come here?

949
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:56,020
I'm gonna be honest with you, guys.

950
00:52:57,140 --> 00:53:00,580
If any of the kingdoms want to invade us and just...

951
00:53:00,580 --> 00:53:02,580
You know, foundation wipe us, I mean, they could.

952
00:53:02,740 --> 00:53:04,680
So, I really hope they don't.

953
00:53:07,380 --> 00:53:07,860
But...

954
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:09,540
More importantly...

955
00:53:09,540 --> 00:53:11,660
Cloud doesn't even have an accent anymore!

956
00:53:12,820 --> 00:53:13,300
He...

957
00:53:13,300 --> 00:53:17,480
He doesn't even...

958
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:19,700
He turned American!

959
00:53:21,060 --> 00:53:23,380
He got educated!

960
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:26,640
In three days, he got a degree!

961
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:42,100
He got colonized.

962
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:48,660
What the fuck?

963
00:53:51,380 --> 00:53:53,360
What's up, guys?

964
00:53:54,560 --> 00:53:55,780
What's up, Steven?

965
00:53:57,580 --> 00:54:05,360
We have a chance to redeem ourselves, though.

966
00:54:05,900 --> 00:54:07,480
A chance for...

967
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:09,780
Action, thrill, and bloodlust.

968
00:54:11,620 --> 00:54:15,400
The Church of the Blood God rides north to attack House Pargarion.

969
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:19,600
House Pargarion, of all the houses, is our most mortal enemy.

970
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:21,860
I share no love for them.

971
00:54:21,940 --> 00:54:23,200
I hate them more than anyone.

972
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:26,400
Except for maybe House Horkonen now at this point, because they're...

973
00:54:28,660 --> 00:54:29,520
Okay, you know what?

974
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:32,820
I'm gonna pause the Game of Thrones music to just kind of vent a little bit of saltiness.

975
00:54:33,560 --> 00:54:37,200
I thought it was insane that they...

976
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:38,000
No, no, no.

977
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:40,280
I'm gonna... I need to let a little bit of salt out.

978
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:45,620
They put down wooden barricades in a fight against us when we have bows.

979
00:54:45,620 --> 00:54:47,560
Is that machine guns?

980
00:54:48,180 --> 00:54:49,920
And they're that serious?

981
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:55,480
Like, we're dressed as fucking wildlings and they're throwing down barricades?

982
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:58,360
Like, how sweaty do you have to be?

983
00:54:58,940 --> 00:55:00,020
Holy shit!

984
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:03,430
I mean, it is war, so...

985
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:06,440
Hey, talk!

986
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:08,380
No presidente, just talk.

987
00:55:09,220 --> 00:55:11,080
Get off me!

988
00:55:12,380 --> 00:55:14,800
I share no love for House Pogarian.

989
00:55:15,560 --> 00:55:18,180
I hate them more than anything.

990
00:55:23,020 --> 00:55:23,280
Speech!

991
00:55:26,020 --> 00:55:28,620
And what about our...

992
00:55:29,380 --> 00:55:34,800
But you know what I love more than my hatred for House Pogarian?

993
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:38,680
Is my love for the North.

994
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:40,600
And we will defend the North.

995
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:54,080
If anyone tries to destroy us in the North, it is House Pogarian, for one of us will defeat the other eventually, but I will not let the Church of the Blood God be the ones to take our mortal enemies from us.

996
00:55:54,180 --> 00:55:59,000
So, on this day, we will walk to the gates of House Pogarian.

997
00:55:59,820 --> 00:56:01,660
They will let us up onto the ramparts.

998
00:56:02,580 --> 00:56:09,740
The first wave of attack we will hold off from up there, and then we will spawn in at the rock here with more arrows.

999
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:14,160
And we will harass the Blood God as they try to attack.

1000
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:17,440
And I'm running out of things to say.

1001
00:56:17,980 --> 00:56:18,560
You get the point!

1002
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:20,980
You get the point!

1003
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:23,060
I wish you get the point!

1004
00:56:23,260 --> 00:56:25,380
How big is their army?

1005
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:26,920
Are we with them?

1006
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:31,280
It doesn't matter how big their army are.

1007
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:32,440
We're fighting a church!

1008
00:56:32,780 --> 00:56:34,040
It doesn't matter who destroys it.

1009
00:56:34,740 --> 00:56:36,280
What matters is the noise.

1010
00:56:37,020 --> 00:56:38,660
It matters that we don't have guns, though.

1011
00:56:38,820 --> 00:56:43,280
One of us is worth tens and thousands of them, alright?

1012
00:56:43,940 --> 00:56:44,960
That's how we need to move forward.

1013
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:46,920
We should consider using guns!

1014
00:56:49,060 --> 00:56:49,500
Guns?

1015
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:50,140
No.

1016
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:53,520
We don't use guns.

1017
00:56:53,700 --> 00:56:54,880
It is so loose!

1018
00:56:57,160 --> 00:56:58,360
Say the word!

1019
00:56:59,260 --> 00:57:00,620
Maybe not now, maybe not now.

1020
00:57:00,620 --> 00:57:01,980
Hold on.

1021
00:57:02,900 --> 00:57:03,580
Maybe.

1022
00:57:08,660 --> 00:57:09,340
Yeah.

1023
00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:17,640
I think they have tier 2.

1024
00:57:17,740 --> 00:57:18,880
Guys, don't say that!

1025
00:57:19,220 --> 00:57:20,800
We're gonna destroy religion!

1026
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:23,920
We're gonna convert them to our religion.

1027
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,100
Do we even have a religion anymore?

1028
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:28,080
Is our religion just Ted?

1029
00:57:30,620 --> 00:57:31,880
Some of us.

1030
00:57:33,540 --> 00:57:34,660
Wait, okay.

1031
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:35,780
Do they have...

1032
00:57:35,780 --> 00:57:36,840
Is the AK ready yet?

1033
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:38,720
Wait, guys.

1034
00:57:38,860 --> 00:57:40,200
Do they have AKs yet?

1035
00:57:40,260 --> 00:57:41,880
Does the church have AKs?

1036
00:57:49,360 --> 00:57:54,340
You don't know what's going on!

1037
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:55,940
Does the church have...

1038
00:57:55,940 --> 00:57:56,600
I just need to know.

1039
00:57:56,680 --> 00:57:58,100
Does the church have AKs?

1040
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:03,360
That's...

1041
00:58:03,360 --> 00:58:04,140
That would change...

1042
00:58:04,140 --> 00:58:06,260
That would be...

1043
00:58:06,260 --> 00:58:07,180
Not yet?

1044
00:58:07,300 --> 00:58:07,620
Okay.

1045
00:58:08,220 --> 00:58:11,920
Okay, I'm gonna wait until one of the squads have AKs.

1046
00:58:19,700 --> 00:58:21,020
So who are we fighting?

1047
00:58:21,380 --> 00:58:23,580
The lord has blessed Michael.

1048
00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:32,400
No, not yet, guys.

1049
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:32,820
No.

1050
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:35,320
We don't betray them yet.

1051
00:58:37,780 --> 00:58:38,840
Not yet.

1052
00:58:39,560 --> 00:58:43,440
Until we get the AK, then I'll think about it, chat.

1053
00:58:44,180 --> 00:58:44,820
Until...

1054
00:58:44,820 --> 00:58:45,400
Until...

1055
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:47,660
Until we have the AK.

1056
00:58:55,700 --> 00:58:59,200
The far left, there is an open gate we can enter.

1057
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:08,660
Me and my bow.

1058
00:59:08,780 --> 00:59:12,680
How did I end up joining the one fucking team that doesn't have...

1059
00:59:12,680 --> 00:59:16,560
That does not use guns for my gun drop?

1060
00:59:16,940 --> 00:59:17,760
How did I...

1061
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:21,080
Only Doki.

1062
00:59:21,900 --> 00:59:24,440
There's like five different...

1063
00:59:25,060 --> 00:59:25,540
Read...

1064
00:59:25,540 --> 00:59:26,260
Five...

1065
00:59:26,260 --> 00:59:30,100
Five plus different tribes going on here.

1066
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:34,180
And I still haven't managed to join the one tribe that doesn't use guns.

1067
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:37,420
You let go of your fucking arrow.

1068
00:59:37,540 --> 00:59:38,120
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1069
00:59:38,140 --> 00:59:39,340
Just shoot at whatever you see.

1070
00:59:39,540 --> 00:59:39,840
Pause.

1071
00:59:40,600 --> 00:59:40,960
Pause.

1072
00:59:43,820 --> 00:59:44,180
What?

1073
00:59:44,540 --> 00:59:44,780
What?

1074
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:45,720
We go south.

1075
00:59:46,140 --> 00:59:46,420
Oh.

1076
00:59:46,680 --> 00:59:46,840
Come.

1077
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:49,900
Oh, we go south?

1078
00:59:51,320 --> 00:59:52,160
Where are we heading?

1079
00:59:52,620 --> 00:59:53,860
Okay, you need to decide.

1080
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:54,760
Look, look, look.

1081
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:56,040
No, no, we go, we go...

1082
00:59:56,040 --> 00:59:56,440
Listen, listen.

1083
00:59:56,620 --> 00:59:57,580
Okay, change of plans.

1084
00:59:57,700 --> 00:59:58,240
I'm so sorry.

1085
00:59:58,280 --> 00:59:58,780
I just realized.

1086
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:01,640
I don't think the Blood God Church is going to attack Paugarion.

1087
01:00:02,300 --> 01:00:02,660
What?

1088
01:00:02,820 --> 01:00:04,100
Where did you get your intel?

1089
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:05,400
They're attacking Warchonin.

1090
01:00:06,740 --> 01:00:08,080
Wait, why don't...

1091
01:00:08,080 --> 01:00:08,740
From all these people.

1092
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:09,640
They're attacking Warchonin.

1093
01:00:10,580 --> 01:00:15,120
Wait, are we going to be working together with the Blood Church?

1094
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:18,760
We're going to make it a revenge.

1095
01:00:18,940 --> 01:00:19,140
No.

1096
01:00:20,100 --> 01:00:22,360
We're attacking Warchonin for revenge.

1097
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:25,480
Yeah, so we're working together with the Blood God.

1098
01:00:29,250 --> 01:00:30,530
It's not the same thing.

1099
01:00:30,690 --> 01:00:31,270
You know, we're...

1100
01:00:31,270 --> 01:00:32,270
Yeah, we'll kill them afterwards.

1101
01:00:33,990 --> 01:00:35,510
They're just like, wait a minute.

1102
01:00:35,510 --> 01:00:36,550
We hate everyone.

1103
01:00:41,190 --> 01:00:42,230
We don't hate.

1104
01:00:45,990 --> 01:00:47,450
They're like, no, that's different.

1105
01:00:49,410 --> 01:00:50,090
Shoot them.

1106
01:00:50,190 --> 01:00:50,870
The captain stopped.

1107
01:00:51,530 --> 01:00:52,010
He's moving again.

1108
01:00:52,070 --> 01:00:52,550
He's on the move.

1109
01:00:55,470 --> 01:00:56,390
Not allies.

1110
01:00:56,550 --> 01:00:58,270
Just we both hate the same people.

1111
01:00:59,770 --> 01:01:03,230
We just both hate the same people.

1112
01:01:03,450 --> 01:01:04,690
It's not the same, guys.

1113
01:01:05,510 --> 01:01:06,930
It's not the same.

1114
01:01:09,370 --> 01:01:11,990
I can't believe so much happened.

1115
01:01:13,430 --> 01:01:15,570
There's fucking New Zealand in the night?

1116
01:01:16,030 --> 01:01:16,210
He stopped again.

1117
01:01:16,310 --> 01:01:16,690
He stopped.

1118
01:01:17,010 --> 01:01:17,050
Hold.

1119
01:01:18,370 --> 01:01:19,450
He's on the go.

1120
01:01:19,570 --> 01:01:19,870
He's moving.

1121
01:01:20,410 --> 01:01:23,390
He's getting a message from the gods.

1122
01:01:24,170 --> 01:01:26,470
What are the gods telling you, Val?

1123
01:01:33,250 --> 01:01:34,990
I wish we have medals.

1124
01:01:34,990 --> 01:01:37,210
I wish we have medal seeds, guys.

1125
01:01:38,950 --> 01:01:43,570
Just pause and he's like, sorry, I'm getting a message real quick.

1126
01:01:43,970 --> 01:01:45,390
Thanks for the intel, guys.

1127
01:01:45,550 --> 01:01:46,910
Thank you for the intel.

1128
01:01:58,340 --> 01:01:59,840
It's actually crazy.

1129
01:02:00,520 --> 01:02:05,420
So now not only do we have a war for Ted.

1130
01:02:07,420 --> 01:02:08,580
We've got a telephone in the base.

1131
01:02:08,660 --> 01:02:09,640
Is that?

1132
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:11,200
Landline.

1133
01:02:12,740 --> 01:02:15,020
Yeah, I do kind of want to take it down at a moment's notice.

1134
01:02:15,180 --> 01:02:18,320
Wait, so like we hate everything metal, but phones.

1135
01:02:21,620 --> 01:02:23,000
And a few others selected.

1136
01:02:25,140 --> 01:02:26,020
With exceptions.

1137
01:02:26,360 --> 01:02:26,900
With exceptions.

1138
01:02:32,700 --> 01:02:34,540
To a solar panel on the roof.

1139
01:02:34,740 --> 01:02:35,860
But I mean.

1140
01:02:35,860 --> 01:02:38,080
Don't worry about it.

1141
01:02:39,540 --> 01:02:41,800
Metal sucks, but phones though, chat.

1142
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:42,580
Phones.

1143
01:02:43,560 --> 01:02:44,680
Phones are different.

1144
01:02:48,200 --> 01:02:49,740
An AK should have been an exception.

1145
01:02:49,980 --> 01:02:50,700
That's all I'm saying.

1146
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:58,160
They really are the Amish.

1147
01:02:58,740 --> 01:03:02,420
Do you know the Amish use phones like iPhones now?

1148
01:03:05,860 --> 01:03:06,540
Oh my God.

1149
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:08,300
I somehow became Amish.

1150
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:18,860
Yeah, no, they do.

1151
01:03:19,100 --> 01:03:20,180
Yes, the Amish.

1152
01:03:22,420 --> 01:03:24,540
The Amish have like used phones.

1153
01:03:24,980 --> 01:03:26,320
Yeah, it's loud apparently.

1154
01:03:26,980 --> 01:03:28,380
The Amish with exceptions.

1155
01:03:33,080 --> 01:03:34,120
Does he know that?

1156
01:03:34,140 --> 01:03:37,300
I've seen an Amish with an iPhone and they like threw me off.

1157
01:03:38,660 --> 01:03:39,900
It was so fucking weird.

1158
01:03:50,380 --> 01:03:52,180
There's a specific sector?

1159
01:03:52,740 --> 01:03:54,900
There's different sectors of Amish?

1160
01:03:56,760 --> 01:03:57,500
Which Amish?

1161
01:03:58,160 --> 01:04:00,760
Wait, I thought the Amish were just the Amish.

1162
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:11,380
I live near an Amish community.

1163
01:04:11,680 --> 01:04:14,380
Walking through Wal- They go to Walmart?

1164
01:04:15,460 --> 01:04:19,740
I thought they grow and make- Wait, what?

1165
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:23,560
They go to Walmart now?

1166
01:04:25,660 --> 01:04:29,540
They love- What are they doing at Walmart?

1167
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:32,880
What are they- What are they fucking Tupperware?

1168
01:04:33,560 --> 01:04:35,480
Are they buying Tupperware?

1169
01:04:35,700 --> 01:04:36,360
Like-

1170
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:42,180
I didn't know.

1171
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:44,800
I didn't know they would go to fucking Walmart.

1172
01:04:47,140 --> 01:04:49,380
There was an Amish patch notes.

1173
01:04:52,420 --> 01:04:55,640
The fucking Amish patch notes that I didn't read about.

1174
01:05:01,360 --> 01:05:01,840
Oh.

1175
01:05:03,020 --> 01:05:03,540
Who are they?

1176
01:05:03,740 --> 01:05:04,480
Who are they, bro?

1177
01:05:17,030 --> 01:05:17,790
Oh, no.

1178
01:05:18,870 --> 01:05:20,090
Oh, my God.

1179
01:05:22,310 --> 01:05:23,830
30 seconds.

1180
01:05:26,290 --> 01:05:27,350
30 seconds.

1181
01:05:27,750 --> 01:05:37,310
Oh, this game.

1182
01:05:39,730 --> 01:05:40,950
Oh, my God.

1183
01:05:41,110 --> 01:05:41,930
Oh, my God.

1184
01:05:51,390 --> 01:05:53,070
Oh, my God.

1185
01:05:55,250 --> 01:05:56,410
I can't.

1186
01:05:56,770 --> 01:05:59,530
We actually call a fucking Uber.

1187
01:06:00,130 --> 01:06:07,330
We - Oh, my God.

1188
01:06:07,330 --> 01:06:07,350
Wait.

1189
01:06:12,070 --> 01:06:12,750
Oh, my God.

1190
01:06:12,850 --> 01:06:17,630
Fucking New Zealand runs a- Runs a taxi- Runs an Uber service.

1191
01:06:20,310 --> 01:06:21,390
Oh, my God.

1192
01:06:22,590 --> 01:06:24,910
Where are we head- Are we heading to Walmart?

1193
01:06:38,490 --> 01:06:39,590
What about poop?

1194
01:06:39,830 --> 01:06:40,450
Can I have poop?

1195
01:06:41,030 --> 01:06:41,290
Fuck.

1196
01:06:42,430 --> 01:06:43,750
I need to take a shit.

1197
01:06:45,090 --> 01:06:46,030
Oh, please.

1198
01:06:46,250 --> 01:06:46,710
Take a shit.

1199
01:06:47,170 --> 01:06:47,410
Oh, please.

1200
01:06:51,890 --> 01:06:56,610
I think- I'm pretty sure- Oh, fuck.

1201
01:06:56,930 --> 01:06:58,010
Who's eating my shit?

1202
01:07:03,230 --> 01:07:05,870
This has been a weird day, guys.

1203
01:07:06,430 --> 01:07:08,070
This has been a weird day.

1204
01:07:09,230 --> 01:07:11,570
Why did I ever wake up from my coma?

1205
01:07:14,850 --> 01:07:19,890
I feel like I'm already in economy.

1206
01:07:20,370 --> 01:07:23,210
I feel like I'm already in economy now, guys.

1207
01:07:24,970 --> 01:07:27,630
This must be what it's like to fly in economy.

1208
01:07:35,870 --> 01:07:38,170
Three minutes show.

1209
01:07:42,590 --> 01:07:43,590
Oh,

1210
01:07:46,830 --> 01:07:47,090
no.

1211
01:07:48,950 --> 01:07:49,430
Please.

1212
01:07:50,470 --> 01:07:52,710
Are there any-

1213
01:08:00,570 --> 01:08:03,270
I should have walked, guys.

1214
01:08:05,870 --> 01:08:08,730
I should have walked, guys.

1215
01:08:09,810 --> 01:08:11,710
I should have walked.

1216
01:08:17,690 --> 01:08:20,890
I'm thinking about jumping right now.

1217
01:08:23,750 --> 01:08:28,190
The temptation is growing by the second.

1218
01:08:36,410 --> 01:08:37,250
Oh,

1219
01:08:41,530 --> 01:08:41,990
my God.

1220
01:08:42,310 --> 01:08:44,790
Everything is so different above here.

1221
01:08:47,610 --> 01:08:48,690
Let's see.

1222
01:08:49,130 --> 01:08:50,890
Where did we- Where are we?

1223
01:09:02,450 --> 01:09:09,030
Well- Isn't that- Appreciate you, brother.

1224
01:09:11,230 --> 01:09:18,130
Wait, isn't that father- Isn't that one of the blood god people over there?

1225
01:09:21,270 --> 01:09:28,690
Over- Yeah, that's- He's just standing there looking at us.

1226
01:09:34,090 --> 01:09:35,890
Wait, that's him.

1227
01:09:37,130 --> 01:09:38,430
He disappeared.

1228
01:09:41,870 --> 01:09:44,110
I like

1229
01:09:49,890 --> 01:09:53,750
how he just looked at us.

1230
01:09:54,430 --> 01:09:56,550
Where did he go?

1231
01:10:14,370 --> 01:10:16,590
Are we preparing for a war right now?

1232
01:10:18,550 --> 01:10:19,710
Wait, there he is.

1233
01:10:30,040 --> 01:10:35,980
You think- You ever think God has forsaken you?

1234
01:10:40,870 --> 01:10:41,390
Sometimes.

1235
01:10:47,450 --> 01:10:51,190
What the fuck is going on?

1236
01:10:53,350 --> 01:10:56,130
Guys, I think-

1237
01:11:02,570 --> 01:11:06,010
Guys, I think Twinkles is getting tempted.

1238
01:11:10,770 --> 01:11:11,910
I think-

1239
01:11:16,250 --> 01:11:20,330
I think I just witnessed a conversion right now.

1240
01:11:22,490 --> 01:11:23,390
Where's the last one at?

1241
01:11:23,450 --> 01:11:24,410
Can you close all the doors?

1242
01:11:27,090 --> 01:11:30,790
We might need some beds.

1243
01:11:30,990 --> 01:11:32,010
Yeah, I need a bed.

1244
01:11:32,150 --> 01:11:32,470
I need a bed.

1245
01:11:32,730 --> 01:11:33,630
How many beds do we need?

1246
01:11:33,710 --> 01:11:33,890
How many beds do we need?

1247
01:11:38,810 --> 01:11:40,090
Rock always wins.

1248
01:11:43,130 --> 01:11:44,090
Wait, is this Mendo?

1249
01:11:44,830 --> 01:11:46,610
It's fucking-

1250
01:11:51,850 --> 01:11:54,150
He'll give up one day.

1251
01:12:01,190 --> 01:12:03,130
He's gonna give up soon.

1252
01:12:04,070 --> 01:12:04,870
There's no way.

1253
01:12:06,210 --> 01:12:07,350
He's gonna stop.

1254
01:12:09,030 --> 01:12:10,930
Rock always wins.

1255
01:12:14,090 --> 01:12:16,570
Rock always wins.

1256
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:20,950
We're in the middle of the war and he's gonna fucking stop.

1257
01:12:25,770 --> 01:12:27,250
Oh, Rock.

1258
01:12:33,050 --> 01:12:35,350
This is the real war.

1259
01:12:36,830 --> 01:12:38,810
We mean as smart.

1260
01:12:39,250 --> 01:12:40,450
Rock always wins.

1261
01:12:40,510 --> 01:12:41,490
What are you talking about?

1262
01:12:44,090 --> 01:12:45,310
Then why am I not winning?

1263
01:12:50,710 --> 01:12:51,350
Shit.

1264
01:12:53,430 --> 01:12:57,050
I told you.

1265
01:12:57,210 --> 01:12:58,670
Rock always wins.

1266
01:13:02,830 --> 01:13:03,650
Not a believer.

1267
01:13:04,010 --> 01:13:05,150
You just weren't a believer.

1268
01:13:09,230 --> 01:13:09,870
Mentally.

1269
01:13:09,930 --> 01:13:11,650
I'm just mentally stronger than you.

1270
01:13:15,650 --> 01:13:16,990
Wait, what's up, Mendo?

1271
01:13:17,850 --> 01:13:20,350
We need some epic music, man.

1272
01:13:21,030 --> 01:13:21,990
We need some epic music.

1273
01:13:22,290 --> 01:13:22,590
Okay.

1274
01:13:25,050 --> 01:13:28,650
Guys, half of us have fucking bow and arrows.

1275
01:13:38,970 --> 01:13:40,690
Get down with that, Mendo.

1276
01:13:42,570 --> 01:13:43,890
Why did it stop?

1277
01:13:44,250 --> 01:13:45,130
Keep going.

1278
01:13:48,290 --> 01:13:50,450
That should be the music to war.

1279
01:14:03,700 --> 01:14:05,500
Did you get converted?

1280
01:14:05,840 --> 01:14:07,380
I saw you talking to him.

1281
01:14:08,340 --> 01:14:10,240
I saw you talking to him.

1282
01:14:14,840 --> 01:14:16,200
Do you have food, Abby?

1283
01:14:16,980 --> 01:14:17,760
Oh, really?

1284
01:14:20,560 --> 01:14:24,840
He was second-guessing the blood guy?

1285
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:30,620
What's his name?

1286
01:14:30,900 --> 01:14:32,280
Billy's not gonna like that.

1287
01:14:37,660 --> 01:14:38,800
Go, baby.

1288
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:40,920
Billy's not gonna like that.

1289
01:14:54,960 --> 01:14:55,640
The priest fell on a pan and died.

1290
01:14:55,640 --> 01:14:59,420
People who love fishing?

1291
01:15:04,740 --> 01:15:06,520
You mean, like, fish fish?

1292
01:15:11,500 --> 01:15:13,120
I meant, like, fish?

1293
01:15:13,240 --> 01:15:14,880
Yeah, men who love fishing.

1294
01:15:20,820 --> 01:15:22,580
We're going bottom right.

1295
01:15:22,700 --> 01:15:23,120
Let's go.

1296
01:15:23,640 --> 01:15:24,260
Let's go.

1297
01:15:29,300 --> 01:15:31,720
Oh, my God.

1298
01:15:32,220 --> 01:15:33,080
Oh, my God.

1299
01:15:33,080 --> 01:15:34,060
We're shooting.

1300
01:15:40,920 --> 01:15:42,500
Son of a bitch.

1301
01:15:51,400 --> 01:15:53,040
I didn't set up a bed.

1302
01:15:53,060 --> 01:15:54,220
I didn't set up a bed.

1303
01:15:56,220 --> 01:15:58,240
We have 85 satchels.

1304
01:15:58,340 --> 01:15:59,560
I hope you brought yours as well.

1305
01:15:59,840 --> 01:16:01,940
I didn't bring any sleeping bags, guys.

1306
01:16:02,380 --> 01:16:05,680
I didn't bring any sleeping bags.

1307
01:16:06,680 --> 01:16:08,920
T-21.

1308
01:16:09,480 --> 01:16:11,280
What the fuck?

1309
01:16:13,140 --> 01:16:15,680
I didn't...

1310
01:16:15,680 --> 01:16:16,640
No!

1311
01:16:32,480 --> 01:16:34,680
What the fuck?

1312
01:16:34,680 --> 01:16:38,680
I can't believe...

1313
01:16:40,200 --> 01:16:47,100
The hour... The time I got on for Russ is, like, the great fucking war is starting.

1314
01:16:47,320 --> 01:16:51,160
What are the odds?

1315
01:16:51,720 --> 01:16:55,480
What are the fucking odds that a war has fucking started?

1316
01:16:56,120 --> 01:16:57,060
When I got on.

1317
01:17:13,340 --> 01:17:16,400
We're gonna fucking take a kingdom, apparently.

1318
01:17:16,400 --> 01:17:18,800
I'm gonna be part of history, chat!

1319
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:21,540
I shall be part of history!

1320
01:17:24,620 --> 01:17:25,680
Okay, okay.

1321
01:17:25,800 --> 01:17:26,400
Good, good.

1322
01:17:29,900 --> 01:17:31,520
Which side of history?

1323
01:17:31,620 --> 01:17:32,280
That's true.

1324
01:17:33,680 --> 01:17:34,440
Which...

1325
01:17:34,440 --> 01:17:36,080
Which... Wait.

1326
01:17:36,760 --> 01:17:38,380
Does anyone...

1327
01:17:38,380 --> 01:17:40,800
Does any... Anyone have extra?

1328
01:17:43,040 --> 01:17:44,240
What part?

1329
01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:45,180
Which side?

1330
01:17:47,180 --> 01:17:49,640
Blood don't grow on trees.

1331
01:17:52,060 --> 01:17:54,420
I'm, like, in the Hunger Games.

1332
01:17:55,180 --> 01:17:57,780
Blood God's gonna take me.

1333
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,820
I'm in the fucking Hunger Games shit.

1334
01:18:10,550 --> 01:18:12,370
How are the fish today?

1335
01:18:12,670 --> 01:18:13,290
Pretty good?

1336
01:18:13,350 --> 01:18:15,730
We're just passing through, just a little...

1337
01:18:15,730 --> 01:18:18,110
Yeah, it's the monthly, uh, fun run.

1338
01:18:19,590 --> 01:18:22,630
It's just the monthly fun run, don't mind us.

1339
01:18:23,890 --> 01:18:25,610
Just the fucking fishermen!

1340
01:18:26,030 --> 01:18:28,190
We passed the fucking fishermen!

1341
01:18:31,570 --> 01:18:33,570
Man, he loves fishing!

1342
01:18:34,350 --> 01:18:35,850
There he is!

1343
01:18:36,150 --> 01:18:37,710
There's one of the men that love fishing!

1344
01:18:46,390 --> 01:18:50,590
I got blood and pay to the shrine today.

1345
01:18:50,750 --> 01:18:53,610
The Blood God's gonna kill me.

1346
01:18:54,600 --> 01:18:57,210
There ain't no rest for the Blood God.

1347
01:18:58,030 --> 01:19:00,650
Blood don't grow on trees.

1348
01:19:01,050 --> 01:19:04,290
I got blood and pay, bills to pay.

1349
01:19:04,690 --> 01:19:06,970
The Blood God's gonna kill me.

1350
01:19:12,370 --> 01:19:14,610
Bro, I'm fucking... This is a jam.

1351
01:19:14,750 --> 01:19:16,770
You gotta release this, actually, on Spotify.

1352
01:19:16,770 --> 01:19:20,210
Like, that should actually be on Spotify!

1353
01:19:28,770 --> 01:19:37,500
Wait, where was

1354
01:19:40,590 --> 01:19:41,210
the island?

1355
01:19:54,480 --> 01:19:56,960
What the fuck?

1356
01:19:59,140 --> 01:20:02,780
Why didn't we not take the Uber to, like, get closer?

1357
01:20:04,900 --> 01:20:06,700
Why didn't we take that Uber?

1358
01:20:10,300 --> 01:20:14,360
Clearly, we have to take that Uber instead of running all the way here.

1359
01:20:15,780 --> 01:20:16,760
Not have money?

1360
01:20:17,160 --> 01:20:17,680
Fuck.

1361
01:20:17,680 --> 01:20:21,740
Dude, what the fuck?

1362
01:20:22,180 --> 01:20:22,800
Oh,

1363
01:20:27,800 --> 01:20:27,800
shit!

1364
01:20:28,900 --> 01:20:30,120
It's starting!

1365
01:20:35,800 --> 01:20:38,260
Oh my God, they're already starting!

1366
01:20:38,380 --> 01:20:39,640
The war is starting!

1367
01:20:40,280 --> 01:20:41,800
Wait, does anyone have extra bags?

1368
01:20:44,180 --> 01:20:46,260
Is someone get my gun?

1369
01:20:46,480 --> 01:20:47,580
I'm broke.

1370
01:20:48,640 --> 01:20:50,140
Oh my God.

1371
01:20:59,720 --> 01:21:04,680
Wait, does anyone have extra bags?

1372
01:21:08,640 --> 01:21:10,900
I don't have extra bags, guys.

1373
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:12,040
This is bad!

1374
01:21:12,660 --> 01:21:14,420
Where is Blau?

1375
01:21:14,880 --> 01:21:17,680
I'm fucking lost and confused.

1376
01:21:17,740 --> 01:21:20,480
Guys, look at, like, how many people there are here.

1377
01:21:21,980 --> 01:21:22,580
Yeah?

1378
01:21:23,160 --> 01:21:23,840
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1379
01:21:24,860 --> 01:21:25,980
Thank you.

1380
01:21:28,400 --> 01:21:29,780
Oh my God, a rocket ship.

1381
01:21:34,440 --> 01:21:36,060
What do I wanna name it?

1382
01:21:36,640 --> 01:21:37,460
Help me.

1383
01:21:46,560 --> 01:21:48,340
Try to figure it out.

1384
01:21:48,980 --> 01:21:50,500
It's so funny.

1385
01:21:57,840 --> 01:22:00,080
Oh my God, we gotta go this way.

1386
01:22:00,720 --> 01:22:03,020
But no one came to help.

1387
01:22:03,680 --> 01:22:05,100
Not shoot them.

1388
01:22:07,140 --> 01:22:08,520
Oh my God.

1389
01:22:09,720 --> 01:22:11,220
There they are.

1390
01:22:12,080 --> 01:22:13,280
There he is.

1391
01:22:20,140 --> 01:22:23,640
Oh my God, we have bows and arrows!

1392
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,010
How did he down them?

1393
01:22:30,150 --> 01:22:32,190
They're so far...

1394
01:22:37,110 --> 01:22:38,730
Bojack vs.

1395
01:22:39,290 --> 01:22:40,190
Hemlock.

1396
01:22:46,190 --> 01:22:47,540
Oh my God.

1397
01:22:52,980 --> 01:22:54,460
Oh my God.

1398
01:22:54,560 --> 01:22:55,200
Oh my God, what is this?

1399
01:22:55,880 --> 01:22:57,600
What war did we get into?

1400
01:22:58,020 --> 01:22:59,380
The old Viking...

1401
01:22:59,380 --> 01:23:02,780
The old Viking ways.

1402
01:23:04,860 --> 01:23:06,700
Is that...

1403
01:23:06,700 --> 01:23:08,540
Is he...

1404
01:23:12,320 --> 01:23:15,120
Sorry, you look just like them!

1405
01:23:19,420 --> 01:23:21,600
Yeah, yeah, you were running at him!

1406
01:23:21,680 --> 01:23:22,720
You were next to him!

1407
01:23:25,120 --> 01:23:26,500
Why were you next to him?

1408
01:23:26,740 --> 01:23:29,380
Why were you next to him?

1409
01:23:33,920 --> 01:23:35,720
Don't worry, I took the arrows out.

1410
01:23:35,800 --> 01:23:36,360
Don't worry.

1411
01:23:37,520 --> 01:23:38,820
Don't worry, don't worry.

1412
01:23:38,920 --> 01:23:39,420
You're 4k.

1413
01:23:39,460 --> 01:23:41,440
I took the arrows.

1414
01:23:48,460 --> 01:23:52,560
You gotta say something when you were getting shot at earlier.

1415
01:23:52,760 --> 01:23:53,980
Why didn't you say anything?

1416
01:23:55,180 --> 01:23:55,860
I tried.

1417
01:23:56,140 --> 01:23:58,740
I said something the moment I got hit by an arrow.

1418
01:23:59,960 --> 01:24:01,280
Honestly, I'm just observing.

1419
01:24:01,440 --> 01:24:02,900
I don't really know what's going on.

1420
01:24:03,080 --> 01:24:03,900
Yeah, me too.

1421
01:24:04,020 --> 01:24:05,460
I woke up...

1422
01:24:05,460 --> 01:24:11,880
I went to bed on the first day and then apparently I slipped into a coma and woke up today.

1423
01:24:12,080 --> 01:24:14,480
And now we're in a war and I got drafted in a war.

1424
01:24:15,080 --> 01:24:16,220
I don't know what happened either.

1425
01:24:16,220 --> 01:24:17,800
Yeah, I know.

1426
01:24:18,400 --> 01:24:20,880
I mean, somebody killed somebody.

1427
01:24:21,060 --> 01:24:22,460
Somebody killed somebody else.

1428
01:24:22,620 --> 01:24:25,200
And then they killed somebody else and then...

1429
01:24:25,200 --> 01:24:29,800
And now all us young people are trying to fight somebody else's war?

1430
01:24:34,480 --> 01:24:37,660
No, I mean, isn't that always the case?

1431
01:24:37,780 --> 01:24:41,100
It's all these big fancy highfalutin leaders that are...

1432
01:24:41,100 --> 01:24:42,160
Yeah, using us.

1433
01:24:42,180 --> 01:24:43,400
Making everybody fight in wars.

1434
01:24:43,780 --> 01:24:45,620
I don't even know what I'm fighting for anymore.

1435
01:24:45,620 --> 01:24:49,220
They told me I'm fighting for some guy named Ted.

1436
01:24:49,420 --> 01:24:51,080
Who the fuck is Ted?

1437
01:24:52,040 --> 01:24:54,260
I don't even know who that guy is.

1438
01:24:56,920 --> 01:24:59,460
He's part of your group, but I'm gonna be honest.

1439
01:24:59,660 --> 01:25:01,540
I think this whole war is over nothing.

1440
01:25:02,400 --> 01:25:04,860
I've been inside the drama here.

1441
01:25:04,960 --> 01:25:10,040
Were you part of... Did you watch everything unfold from the very beginning?

1442
01:25:10,040 --> 01:25:10,240
Everything?

1443
01:25:22,540 --> 01:25:27,180
Wait, you must have made a lot of money from this.

1444
01:25:30,020 --> 01:25:32,400
You must have capitalized it.

1445
01:25:33,580 --> 01:25:35,540
Yeah, so you wouldn't want the war to be over.

1446
01:25:35,540 --> 01:25:36,540
I have...

1447
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:41,180
Why would you want the war to be over?

1448
01:25:41,300 --> 01:25:42,740
How are you gonna feed...

1449
01:25:42,740 --> 01:25:44,320
How would you feed your kids?

1450
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:46,180
If the war ends?

1451
01:25:46,480 --> 01:25:48,440
There's always people that need balloon rides.

1452
01:25:48,600 --> 01:25:49,300
There's always...

1453
01:25:49,300 --> 01:25:54,000
Well, first of all, my kids can't eat because I keep gambling away all of my scrap.

1454
01:25:55,520 --> 01:25:55,960
Okay.

1455
01:25:59,680 --> 01:26:00,120
So...

1456
01:26:00,120 --> 01:26:02,500
Look, there's always people that need balloon rides.

1457
01:26:02,580 --> 01:26:04,800
And I'm just tired of all the death and suffering.

1458
01:26:05,860 --> 01:26:06,300
Yeah.

1459
01:26:06,460 --> 01:26:07,680
It's just too much for me to bear.

1460
01:26:10,220 --> 01:26:13,260
It was nice talking to you, but I think I have to go back to war.

1461
01:26:13,800 --> 01:26:16,080
If I see you again tomorrow...

1462
01:26:16,080 --> 01:26:16,720
Probably do.

1463
01:26:16,980 --> 01:26:18,400
Then that meant I made it.

1464
01:26:18,860 --> 01:26:19,740
I survived.

1465
01:26:21,140 --> 01:26:23,060
This might be the last you'll see me.

1466
01:26:23,060 --> 01:26:25,240
It's a bloodbath up there.

1467
01:26:25,240 --> 01:26:26,400
Goodbye, sir.

1468
01:26:32,700 --> 01:26:34,080
Off to war I go.

1469
01:26:35,400 --> 01:26:37,640
Off returning back to war.

1470
01:26:41,870 --> 01:26:46,170
I can't believe this all started off because of some fucking guy named Ed.

1471
01:26:48,810 --> 01:26:50,810
It made me your destiny.

1472
01:26:53,110 --> 01:26:53,830
Wow!

1473
01:27:00,020 --> 01:27:01,960
Who did I get shot by?

1474
01:27:20,190 --> 01:27:21,030
What happened?

1475
01:27:24,510 --> 01:27:26,070
We killed a guy with a gun.

1476
01:27:26,830 --> 01:27:28,330
What did we do with it?

1477
01:27:32,320 --> 01:27:33,000
Steal it.

1478
01:27:33,240 --> 01:27:34,600
Then we sell it on the black market.

1479
01:27:35,320 --> 01:27:36,920
For the people who like to use guns.

1480
01:27:36,920 --> 01:27:38,320
Oh wait, I want water.

1481
01:27:38,420 --> 01:27:40,380
Guys, how do I fill the water up?

1482
01:27:44,240 --> 01:27:45,800
How do I drink the water?

1483
01:27:45,980 --> 01:27:47,100
Wait, first off...

1484
01:27:47,600 --> 01:27:48,100
How do I...

1485
01:27:50,060 --> 01:27:52,000
Oh, that's how you drink it.

1486
01:27:53,820 --> 01:27:54,880
There you go.

1487
01:28:00,880 --> 01:28:01,400
Hydrate.

1488
01:28:02,080 --> 01:28:04,060
Remember to stay hydrated, boys.

1489
01:28:04,320 --> 01:28:05,240
Stay hydrated.

1490
01:28:07,440 --> 01:28:09,240
Yeah, I need another one.

1491
01:28:09,340 --> 01:28:10,380
Yeah, I got a bed ready.

1492
01:28:14,280 --> 01:28:17,520
No, no, I have a bed.

1493
01:28:17,620 --> 01:28:18,900
But it's all the way back there.

1494
01:28:22,840 --> 01:28:23,240
Wait,

1495
01:28:28,060 --> 01:28:28,580
is he...

1496
01:28:28,580 --> 01:28:29,540
Are these bad people?

1497
01:28:33,260 --> 01:28:34,700
Wait, I thought this was...

1498
01:28:34,700 --> 01:28:35,700
A bad person lives here?

1499
01:28:35,780 --> 01:28:36,040
Oh!

1500
01:28:36,040 --> 01:28:36,260
Woah!

1501
01:28:36,780 --> 01:28:37,560
They're killing her!

1502
01:28:39,420 --> 01:28:40,180
She's crazy.

1503
01:28:40,800 --> 01:28:41,440
Do we kill her?

1504
01:28:43,860 --> 01:28:45,460
Yeah, kill her.

1505
01:28:45,520 --> 01:28:46,040
She's down.

1506
01:28:46,280 --> 01:28:46,740
She's down.

1507
01:28:46,840 --> 01:28:47,880
Oh my god.

1508
01:28:47,980 --> 01:28:49,020
There's one by our garage.

1509
01:28:49,060 --> 01:28:49,980
I thought you were better than that.

1510
01:28:50,580 --> 01:28:51,520
I thought you were better.

1511
01:28:51,940 --> 01:28:53,020
Fuck your dragon breath.

1512
01:28:53,440 --> 01:28:54,120
There's still one more.

1513
01:28:54,260 --> 01:28:54,840
There's still one more.

1514
01:28:55,180 --> 01:28:56,620
Listen, don't loot her weapon.

1515
01:28:56,860 --> 01:28:57,440
Don't loot her weapon.

1516
01:28:57,460 --> 01:28:58,340
Can I take her clothes?

1517
01:29:02,360 --> 01:29:03,200
I'm just...

1518
01:29:03,200 --> 01:29:04,320
I'm gonna take her pants.

1519
01:29:05,130 --> 01:29:05,900
I need...

1520
01:29:08,160 --> 01:29:09,560
I'm gonna take her pants.

1521
01:29:16,600 --> 01:29:18,220
What the fuck?

1522
01:29:20,240 --> 01:29:21,280
Oh my god.

1523
01:29:29,020 --> 01:29:30,460
That is a lot.

1524
01:29:30,820 --> 01:29:31,720
Wow, that's all you, tiger.

1525
01:29:32,100 --> 01:29:32,640
That's all you.

1526
01:29:34,320 --> 01:29:37,740
I'm gonna go and die somewhere and grief them and never give it back.

1527
01:29:41,500 --> 01:29:43,800
It's so rare, guys.

1528
01:29:44,100 --> 01:29:44,640
What's so...

1529
01:29:44,640 --> 01:29:45,360
What's...

1530
01:29:45,360 --> 01:29:45,620
Oh!

1531
01:29:46,540 --> 01:29:48,540
It's for gunpowder.

1532
01:29:49,460 --> 01:29:49,940
Yes.

1533
01:29:56,820 --> 01:29:58,220
Yeah, no.

1534
01:29:58,280 --> 01:29:58,740
I got one.

1535
01:29:58,780 --> 01:29:59,380
I got one already.

1536
01:29:59,500 --> 01:30:00,920
It's like all the way back there.

1537
01:30:00,920 --> 01:30:01,340
There.

1538
01:30:02,980 --> 01:30:04,940
Where we first started the war.

1539
01:30:10,820 --> 01:30:11,760
I wanna go and fight.

1540
01:30:12,500 --> 01:30:12,960
Then go.

1541
01:30:13,340 --> 01:30:13,700
Go.

1542
01:30:14,240 --> 01:30:14,640
Fight.

1543
01:30:15,080 --> 01:30:15,400
Kill.

1544
01:30:16,160 --> 01:30:17,020
Okay, nevermind.

1545
01:30:19,060 --> 01:30:19,940
From above.

1546
01:30:20,120 --> 01:30:20,900
Above on the tower.

1547
01:30:23,200 --> 01:30:24,940
Heads up, you have to all warriors.

1548
01:30:25,460 --> 01:30:26,680
You cannot barricade.

1549
01:30:29,680 --> 01:30:31,820
I don't know if this will hit.

1550
01:30:36,480 --> 01:30:37,720
Okay, let's see.

1551
01:30:40,540 --> 01:30:41,860
I don't know.

1552
01:30:42,040 --> 01:30:43,380
Maybe here?

1553
01:30:44,700 --> 01:30:46,140
Does that hit?

1554
01:30:48,480 --> 01:30:50,420
I don't fucking know!

1555
01:30:50,860 --> 01:30:53,620
We're fucking shooting with bows and arrows!

1556
01:30:56,560 --> 01:30:59,040
Yeah, there's two guys up on the roof.

1557
01:31:01,760 --> 01:31:03,060
Two guys up on the roof?

1558
01:31:03,380 --> 01:31:04,420
Yeah, two guys up on the roof.

1559
01:31:04,420 --> 01:31:06,700
Was somebody on the left side here?

1560
01:31:06,840 --> 01:31:07,400
I don't know.

1561
01:31:07,560 --> 01:31:08,560
I got shot from the tower.

1562
01:31:10,880 --> 01:31:12,060
Yeah, he's on top of the tower.

1563
01:31:16,440 --> 01:31:17,760
There's somebody on the ground here.

1564
01:31:21,140 --> 01:31:22,340
I'm lighting it up.

1565
01:31:25,140 --> 01:31:25,880
Oh, don't do that.

1566
01:31:26,480 --> 01:31:31,670
It would be crazy if I hit this.

1567
01:31:31,830 --> 01:31:32,950
We may need to give up the air balloon.

1568
01:31:33,130 --> 01:31:33,970
We may need to give up.

1569
01:31:36,690 --> 01:31:39,490
When is the next church service?

1570
01:31:39,970 --> 01:31:42,930
We're in the middle of a fucking war!

1571
01:31:43,230 --> 01:31:44,170
What do you mean?

1572
01:31:54,940 --> 01:31:55,900
He's in front of me!

1573
01:32:01,300 --> 01:32:02,100
Shit!

1574
01:32:03,680 --> 01:32:05,460
Someone help me.

1575
01:32:06,120 --> 01:32:10,990
Oh my god.

1576
01:32:11,390 --> 01:32:12,850
Gotta get my stuff back.

1577
01:32:14,210 --> 01:32:14,350
Okay.

1578
01:32:21,100 --> 01:32:21,980
Let's head.

1579
01:32:22,280 --> 01:32:23,800
Why is he not part of this?

1580
01:32:24,500 --> 01:32:25,800
Why is he not part of this?

1581
01:32:25,900 --> 01:32:27,740
We're literally fighting for him.

1582
01:32:28,080 --> 01:32:31,280
Why is he part of the fight?

1583
01:32:38,060 --> 01:32:39,140
He's just...

1584
01:32:39,140 --> 01:32:42,240
And of course there's a storm while there's a war.

1585
01:32:42,680 --> 01:32:44,780
A fucking course there is a storm.

1586
01:32:50,800 --> 01:32:55,140
God, what is this fucking cinematic universe I'm in right now?

1587
01:32:58,300 --> 01:32:59,860
Where's my stuff?

1588
01:33:00,720 --> 01:33:01,860
Oh, there it is.

1589
01:33:02,040 --> 01:33:02,380
Wait.

1590
01:33:06,980 --> 01:33:08,300
Yeah, where did I die?

1591
01:33:13,100 --> 01:33:15,520
Where did I fucking die?

1592
01:33:15,520 --> 01:33:15,800
Why?

1593
01:33:24,720 --> 01:33:27,660
I'll never find my body!

1594
01:33:37,730 --> 01:33:39,680
Oh my god, there it is.

1595
01:33:40,360 --> 01:33:42,840
Thank god, and I still have her pants.

1596
01:33:43,480 --> 01:33:44,030
That I still...

1597
01:33:46,700 --> 01:33:47,360
Oops.

1598
01:33:54,600 --> 01:33:56,960
What the fuck is going on?

1599
01:33:58,540 --> 01:33:59,300
Wait, what?

1600
01:33:59,740 --> 01:34:00,510
Did they take my...

1601
01:34:03,300 --> 01:34:04,480
Did they take my...

1602
01:34:05,520 --> 01:34:06,460
Did they take my bow?

1603
01:34:06,740 --> 01:34:08,100
Wait, they took my bow.

1604
01:34:09,040 --> 01:34:11,020
Wait, my bow got taken.

1605
01:34:13,480 --> 01:34:14,900
Bow is on the ground?

1606
01:34:18,040 --> 01:34:18,780
Oh, okay.

1607
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:22,340
Fuck, oh there it is.

1608
01:34:22,700 --> 01:34:23,300
I got it.

1609
01:34:26,700 --> 01:34:27,260
Wow!

1610
01:34:27,720 --> 01:34:28,280
Wow!

1611
01:34:29,420 --> 01:34:30,660
That was a shotgun!

1612
01:34:35,800 --> 01:34:37,980
I'm going in, I'm going in!

1613
01:34:39,520 --> 01:34:40,460
Oh,

1614
01:34:43,820 --> 01:34:44,920
he got finished!

1615
01:34:48,680 --> 01:34:50,560
Got you!

1616
01:34:53,240 --> 01:34:55,260
Where is he?

1617
01:34:55,920 --> 01:34:58,100
Everybody in, everybody in, everybody in.

1618
01:34:58,560 --> 01:35:02,000
The other way, the other way!

1619
01:35:04,300 --> 01:35:06,040
Get to the chopper!

1620
01:35:07,620 --> 01:35:09,280
You will all fall!

1621
01:35:09,760 --> 01:35:11,440
Your time is over!

1622
01:35:11,920 --> 01:35:12,560
It's over.

1623
01:35:13,680 --> 01:35:15,340
Oh my god.

1624
01:35:22,900 --> 01:35:24,340
Holy fuck.

1625
01:35:25,280 --> 01:35:25,780
What did we get?

1626
01:35:26,080 --> 01:35:29,960
What did we get shot down?

1627
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,000
I got you, I'm the greatest of all time.

1628
01:35:35,180 --> 01:35:37,480
I'm sorry, I'm scared of heights.

1629
01:35:38,580 --> 01:35:40,740
Yeah, no torches.

1630
01:35:45,140 --> 01:35:49,140
Words for coconut, they're pushing more on the right side.

1631
01:35:49,860 --> 01:35:51,160
So we're pushing on the left side.

1632
01:35:52,640 --> 01:35:54,700
Does anyone have an extra bow by the way?

1633
01:35:56,080 --> 01:35:56,680
Uh, no.

1634
01:35:58,080 --> 01:35:59,800
I have a melee weapon.

1635
01:36:01,080 --> 01:36:03,160
I only have, yeah I only have one bow.

1636
01:36:06,120 --> 01:36:07,880
Where are we even, where are we going?

1637
01:36:09,920 --> 01:36:10,740
You know how to do it?

1638
01:36:10,880 --> 01:36:11,700
Are you sure you know how to do it?

1639
01:36:11,720 --> 01:36:13,520
Yes, I know how to do it.

1640
01:36:13,640 --> 01:36:15,120
I think we're going on the other...

1641
01:36:15,120 --> 01:36:16,800
Just hold on, everybody hold on.

1642
01:36:22,220 --> 01:36:25,040
Okay, so just hold on, we're gonna have to go real high for a second.

1643
01:36:27,140 --> 01:36:28,440
You can reach it from there, right?

1644
01:36:29,380 --> 01:36:30,180
Yeah, I got it.

1645
01:36:30,240 --> 01:36:33,460
We just gotta go real high to get back on course, just gotta spin around again.

1646
01:36:34,300 --> 01:36:35,740
We're gonna figure this out, guys.

1647
01:36:40,520 --> 01:36:40,880
Yeah,

1648
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:50,720
we're just doing a U-turn, guys.

1649
01:36:50,840 --> 01:36:51,640
It's just a U-turn.

1650
01:36:53,960 --> 01:37:04,280
It's just a U-turn, just don't uh, don't lock the button or we're not gonna be able to keep...

1651
01:37:08,700 --> 01:37:11,260
We're, oh my god, we're gonna troy this?

1652
01:37:12,580 --> 01:37:13,980
We're about to go in!

1653
01:37:14,440 --> 01:37:17,180
Oh my god, this is cheating!

1654
01:37:19,640 --> 01:37:21,120
Guys, this is cheating!

1655
01:37:21,640 --> 01:37:24,760
We're de-dating this!

1656
01:37:25,040 --> 01:37:25,960
Are you fucking...

1657
01:37:35,440 --> 01:37:37,880
We're going in, we're going in!

1658
01:37:40,640 --> 01:37:42,740
Airdrop incoming!

1659
01:37:43,680 --> 01:37:45,520
Oh my god, we're...

1660
01:37:51,640 --> 01:37:53,060
Oh my god.

1661
01:37:57,500 --> 01:37:59,000
He's stuck, he's stuck!

1662
01:38:01,300 --> 01:38:01,620
Shadow?

1663
01:38:12,960 --> 01:38:14,080
Hit him one more time.

1664
01:38:14,260 --> 01:38:15,340
I think he DC'd.

1665
01:38:15,880 --> 01:38:16,720
Wait, I'll do it, I'll do it.

1666
01:38:16,960 --> 01:38:18,460
Wait, wait, wait, stop, stop, don't shoot, don't shoot.

1667
01:38:22,530 --> 01:38:23,230
There we go.

1668
01:38:23,470 --> 01:38:25,590
Everybody get out, everybody get out, everybody get out.

1669
01:38:25,750 --> 01:38:26,990
Left, left, left, left.

1670
01:38:27,690 --> 01:38:30,830
Oh my god, how did he DC it this time?

1671
01:38:31,290 --> 01:38:32,310
How did he DC?

1672
01:38:36,250 --> 01:38:37,350
Oh my god.

1673
01:38:48,440 --> 01:38:49,740
Oh my god.

1674
01:39:02,310 --> 01:39:03,250
Who's with you?

1675
01:39:03,290 --> 01:39:03,670
Who's with us?

1676
01:39:03,750 --> 01:39:04,090
Is it just you?

1677
01:39:16,550 --> 01:39:19,930
What is going on?

1678
01:39:23,550 --> 01:39:24,050
Oh,

1679
01:39:28,800 --> 01:39:29,720
oh, okay, we're together.

1680
01:39:30,940 --> 01:39:32,600
We're all together, we're all together.

1681
01:39:33,040 --> 01:39:34,280
We shot each other!

1682
01:39:34,280 --> 01:39:37,520
I can't believe it!

1683
01:39:38,360 --> 01:39:40,880
I can't believe you shot us!

1684
01:39:41,960 --> 01:39:43,820
What is going on?

1685
01:39:44,320 --> 01:39:45,500
We shot each other!

1686
01:39:47,100 --> 01:39:49,880
Friendly fire, friendly fire, friendly fire!

1687
01:39:50,800 --> 01:39:51,800
Where are we running?

1688
01:40:00,220 --> 01:40:02,860
Why are we running still?

1689
01:40:02,860 --> 01:40:05,380
You guys just keep running, where are we going?

1690
01:40:06,700 --> 01:40:08,320
I don't know, I just follow.

1691
01:40:09,160 --> 01:40:11,140
I can't believe we friendly fired.

1692
01:40:19,960 --> 01:40:22,840
A fucking friendly fire!

1693
01:40:24,180 --> 01:40:26,240
Yes, it was all friendly fire!

1694
01:40:26,760 --> 01:40:29,340
They shot us and we had frozen arrows!

1695
01:40:29,860 --> 01:40:30,680
That's bad!

1696
01:40:31,340 --> 01:40:32,240
That's bad!

1697
01:40:32,860 --> 01:40:34,920
Wow, wow, wow!

1698
01:40:34,920 --> 01:40:36,320
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

1699
01:40:36,400 --> 01:40:37,720
He's with us, he's with us!

1700
01:40:38,440 --> 01:40:39,100
What are you doing?

1701
01:40:39,360 --> 01:40:39,900
Oh, he's not!

1702
01:40:40,060 --> 01:40:40,700
Who's with us?

1703
01:40:41,420 --> 01:40:42,300
He's with the Lurklings!

1704
01:40:42,840 --> 01:40:44,940
He is, that's why they were attacking us!

1705
01:40:45,300 --> 01:40:46,000
He joined us!

1706
01:40:46,420 --> 01:40:47,280
He has joined us!

1707
01:40:48,200 --> 01:40:49,040
That's why we're fighting them!

1708
01:40:49,080 --> 01:40:50,720
You got a spy in your fucking church!

1709
01:40:51,500 --> 01:40:55,180
Can every Lurkling put their hands up so we know exactly who you are?

1710
01:40:55,300 --> 01:40:57,120
Okay, Lurklings don't have guns.

1711
01:40:57,660 --> 01:41:01,480
We don't even have guns!

1712
01:41:03,240 --> 01:41:05,160
Wait, Mendo, what do you mean he's a spy?

1713
01:41:06,360 --> 01:41:08,120
Guys, who's a Lurkling?

1714
01:41:10,580 --> 01:41:11,460
Tennis guy!

1715
01:41:12,440 --> 01:41:13,180
Wait, the church?

1716
01:41:13,520 --> 01:41:14,280
We're not in the church!

1717
01:41:17,760 --> 01:41:18,680
Where's your body?

1718
01:41:20,780 --> 01:41:22,360
I'll take his arrows, he's dead anyway.

1719
01:41:24,140 --> 01:41:33,040
Where are we supposed to go?

1720
01:41:36,480 --> 01:41:38,720
I don't even know where we're supposed to go.

1721
01:41:39,400 --> 01:41:40,540
Oh, we can see!

1722
01:41:40,880 --> 01:41:42,900
We can finally see!

1723
01:41:47,600 --> 01:41:49,120
I'm so scared!

1724
01:41:52,360 --> 01:41:54,060
He's shooting wherever the other people are shooting.

1725
01:41:55,090 --> 01:41:56,100
Let's kill him!

1726
01:41:57,240 --> 01:41:58,240
Let's fight back!

1727
01:41:59,180 --> 01:42:00,240
Oh my god.

1728
01:42:01,220 --> 01:42:03,680
Let's fight back with our bows and arrows!

1729
01:42:08,980 --> 01:42:13,760
I hit somebody, but I'm pretty sure it was friendly fire.

1730
01:42:16,650 --> 01:42:18,340
I'm pretty sure.

1731
01:42:18,700 --> 01:42:19,920
I'm pretty sure.

1732
01:42:20,760 --> 01:42:22,300
What can we do?

1733
01:42:22,460 --> 01:42:23,680
We have bows and arrows!

1734
01:42:37,340 --> 01:42:38,640
One's down here, where?

1735
01:42:44,900 --> 01:42:46,000
Oh shit!

1736
01:42:49,570 --> 01:42:52,070
I didn't bring bandages.

1737
01:42:55,610 --> 01:42:57,690
Bro, what if I just take a gun?

1738
01:43:02,810 --> 01:43:04,330
Do you have any meds?

1739
01:43:04,590 --> 01:43:04,910
No.

1740
01:43:07,570 --> 01:43:10,190
I'm gonna go back, I'm gonna go back.

1741
01:43:10,490 --> 01:43:11,930
Where did my teammates go?

1742
01:43:16,270 --> 01:43:17,550
Yo, someone loot down below!

1743
01:43:17,630 --> 01:43:18,110
Loot down below!

1744
01:43:18,430 --> 01:43:19,310
Go loot down below, someone!

1745
01:43:20,470 --> 01:43:21,370
Isn't there a guy below?

1746
01:43:21,630 --> 01:43:22,390
Someone go loot that guy!

1747
01:43:22,390 --> 01:43:23,610
Okay, I'm going, I'm going.

1748
01:43:24,090 --> 01:43:24,710
Loot him!

1749
01:43:24,870 --> 01:43:24,890
Loot him!

1750
01:43:25,110 --> 01:43:25,410
Loot him!

1751
01:43:25,430 --> 01:43:26,010
He's right there.

1752
01:43:33,020 --> 01:43:35,260
I got a headshot and it's friendly.

1753
01:43:35,400 --> 01:43:36,320
Okay, that's pretty funny.

1754
01:43:38,760 --> 01:43:39,680
I hit him!

1755
01:43:40,120 --> 01:43:41,600
I hit him!

1756
01:43:41,620 --> 01:43:42,480
He headshotted!

1757
01:43:42,920 --> 01:43:45,580
The headshot hit the fucking teammate!

1758
01:43:46,200 --> 01:43:47,400
Okay, that's pretty funny.

1759
01:43:50,620 --> 01:43:51,140
What?!

1760
01:43:51,140 --> 01:43:52,620
I can't tell who's the...

1761
01:43:52,620 --> 01:43:57,260
I can't tell who's part of the team and who is a bad guy!

1762
01:43:57,360 --> 01:43:58,000
I can't tell!

1763
01:43:58,240 --> 01:43:59,600
I can never tell!

1764
01:44:02,280 --> 01:44:04,740
They all look the same!

1765
01:44:07,380 --> 01:44:10,380
I can't tell who's bad and who's good!

1766
01:44:16,980 --> 01:44:20,600
Give me, give me, give me.

1767
01:44:23,400 --> 01:44:25,380
Mendo, Mendo, Mendo, where are you?

1768
01:44:25,960 --> 01:44:26,320
Mendo!

1769
01:44:27,520 --> 01:44:30,680
Oh my god, war is confusing!

1770
01:44:31,340 --> 01:44:33,220
I can't tell!

1771
01:44:33,600 --> 01:44:35,880
Everybody has guns!

1772
01:44:39,220 --> 01:44:40,060
Oh

1773
01:44:43,540 --> 01:44:44,740
my god.

1774
01:44:47,920 --> 01:44:49,540
Stay away from me!

1775
01:44:49,540 --> 01:44:50,940
Get over here!

1776
01:44:51,400 --> 01:44:51,920
Get over here!

1777
01:44:52,760 --> 01:44:56,420
Get over here!

1778
01:44:56,520 --> 01:44:58,060
You have, you have stuff!

1779
01:45:02,340 --> 01:45:05,920
Well, okay, they need to fucking aim better though, not gonna lie.

1780
01:45:10,820 --> 01:45:13,040
They're a fucking suck!

1781
01:45:13,660 --> 01:45:18,540
I didn't know if it was good or bad until I saw Blush fucking stone him!

1782
01:45:18,860 --> 01:45:20,860
And I was like, oh, I got a stone back!

1783
01:45:20,860 --> 01:45:22,860
I got a stone back!

1784
01:45:27,700 --> 01:45:29,580
Are they bad or good guys?

1785
01:45:29,760 --> 01:45:31,360
Well, let's find out guys!

1786
01:45:43,880 --> 01:45:49,800
I'm gonna take his clothes.

1787
01:45:52,520 --> 01:45:56,920
I saw the church people, so then I knew they were okay.

1788
01:45:57,300 --> 01:46:00,360
I knew the church people are okay.

1789
01:46:01,060 --> 01:46:07,340
Oh my god, there's so much bloodshed!

1790
01:46:07,820 --> 01:46:10,400
There's so much blood!

1791
01:46:11,160 --> 01:46:13,020
When will war end?

1792
01:46:14,240 --> 01:46:16,240
When will war end?

1793
01:46:19,840 --> 01:46:21,520
War is hell.

1794
01:46:21,980 --> 01:46:27,680
Oh my god.

1795
01:46:29,940 --> 01:46:32,520
They're just here for fucking blood!

1796
01:46:32,840 --> 01:46:35,780
They're not even here, all they want was blood!

1797
01:46:38,920 --> 01:46:42,360
They're just here for fucking, they're just here for corpses!

1798
01:46:44,590 --> 01:46:47,940
They're not even here for like, a purpose!

1799
01:46:54,420 --> 01:46:55,840
How do we get there?

1800
01:46:58,500 --> 01:47:00,420
Where's, how do we get inside?

1801
01:47:04,520 --> 01:47:09,440
Okay, last time I was inside, we flew in with a giant bird.

1802
01:47:19,800 --> 01:47:21,060
Oh my god.

1803
01:47:22,640 --> 01:47:24,360
How do we get in?

1804
01:47:25,040 --> 01:47:28,420
We just keep going round and round and, oh there it is!

1805
01:47:28,900 --> 01:47:31,960
I have 6 HP, let's see how long I live!

1806
01:47:39,180 --> 01:47:42,000
Wait, I got you, I got you!

1807
01:47:45,260 --> 01:47:46,280
Oh, sorry.

1808
01:47:52,040 --> 01:47:52,800
I tried.

1809
01:47:56,260 --> 01:47:56,900
No!

1810
01:48:02,520 --> 01:48:05,200
Guys, I tried, I tried, I tried!

1811
01:48:05,920 --> 01:48:07,200
I did!

1812
01:48:07,580 --> 01:48:10,080
I'm gonna use the bathroom, I'll be right back!

1813
01:50:11,360 --> 01:50:12,060
Oh my god, when?

1814
01:50:12,440 --> 01:50:15,340
War, war never changes!

1815
01:50:16,180 --> 01:50:23,120
Oh my god, war, war never changes!

1816
01:50:30,180 --> 01:50:32,410
How are we still fighting?

1817
01:50:38,720 --> 01:50:40,190
Oh my god.

1818
01:50:43,230 --> 01:50:51,150
If your jobs are not working, remember to link your, remember to link your Twitch account to your Steam account.

1819
01:50:53,730 --> 01:50:56,870
Oh my god, I hope nobody shoots me while I stand in the center.

1820
01:50:57,050 --> 01:50:58,030
I hope...

1821
01:51:00,730 --> 01:51:05,230
I hope, I hope nobody shoots me while I stand there.

1822
01:51:17,780 --> 01:51:18,380
What?

1823
01:51:20,360 --> 01:51:20,700
What?

1824
01:51:38,740 --> 01:51:41,920
Oh my god, they even got Johnny Guitar!

1825
01:51:43,700 --> 01:51:46,180
Wasn't he just a music player?

1826
01:51:46,600 --> 01:51:48,840
They drafted him to the war too?

1827
01:51:49,580 --> 01:51:53,960
He was just... I feel like a journalist right now, I'm covering a war.

1828
01:51:54,480 --> 01:51:57,140
Johnny Guitar, I need to grab a cocktail.

1829
01:51:57,140 --> 01:51:57,340
Good job.

1830
01:51:59,400 --> 01:52:01,800
They even got the music guy?

1831
01:52:11,300 --> 01:52:12,880
I think he's with us, are you?

1832
01:52:13,200 --> 01:52:14,320
Who are you over there?

1833
01:52:17,720 --> 01:52:19,680
He's part of us, he's part of the team!

1834
01:52:19,800 --> 01:52:20,580
Yeah, you're with us.

1835
01:52:20,680 --> 01:52:21,900
You're with us, he's with us.

1836
01:52:22,120 --> 01:52:23,880
We're from the church, we're from the church and we're with Coco.

1837
01:52:25,040 --> 01:52:26,040
Yeah, we're with Coco.

1838
01:52:27,140 --> 01:52:29,660
I don't know where to shoot!

1839
01:52:36,160 --> 01:52:37,820
What's going on?

1840
01:52:37,920 --> 01:52:38,760
Don't shoot!

1841
01:52:39,060 --> 01:52:40,020
Don't shoot!

1842
01:52:41,260 --> 01:52:41,860
Don't shoot!

1843
01:52:41,860 --> 01:52:44,060
I don't know how this...

1844
01:52:44,060 --> 01:52:45,700
We know you're friendly, we know.

1845
01:52:46,760 --> 01:52:47,400
Biz!

1846
01:52:51,570 --> 01:52:54,170
Oh my god, I'll never find my old...

1847
01:52:54,170 --> 01:52:55,870
Please, stay safe around the troops.

1848
01:52:56,350 --> 01:52:56,590
Okay!

1849
01:52:57,830 --> 01:52:59,550
I don't have anything, though!

1850
01:52:59,910 --> 01:53:00,670
Aiden, you got any meds?

1851
01:53:00,750 --> 01:53:01,370
I'm right behind you.

1852
01:53:01,770 --> 01:53:03,290
I lost it all!

1853
01:53:03,710 --> 01:53:04,610
Thanks, dog.

1854
01:53:09,530 --> 01:53:10,010
Alright!

1855
01:53:11,030 --> 01:53:12,870
There's a bunch to your 230, Aiden.

1856
01:53:13,130 --> 01:53:13,930
Like, quite a few.

1857
01:53:16,710 --> 01:53:17,910
I'll take the pads.

1858
01:53:20,690 --> 01:53:22,530
Yes, keep spamming that shit.

1859
01:53:23,390 --> 01:53:24,610
Keep going, keep going!

1860
01:53:26,590 --> 01:53:28,510
Is there anything...

1861
01:53:33,310 --> 01:53:34,030
Oh no!

1862
01:53:41,910 --> 01:53:42,270
Push!

1863
01:53:44,690 --> 01:53:46,110
They can't shoot us all!

1864
01:53:47,210 --> 01:53:49,030
Let me do it, let me do it, let me do it!

1865
01:53:49,930 --> 01:53:51,310
Oh my god, is that a rocket?

1866
01:53:51,390 --> 01:53:52,010
I'm a good shot.

1867
01:53:54,430 --> 01:53:56,070
They're gonna use a rocket launcher?!

1868
01:54:00,070 --> 01:54:01,890
I'm so low, I'm so low!

1869
01:54:04,750 --> 01:54:05,310
Rocket!

1870
01:54:06,630 --> 01:54:07,750
Holy fuck!

1871
01:54:08,030 --> 01:54:08,550
You got more ammo?

1872
01:54:08,750 --> 01:54:09,790
I need pistol bullets.

1873
01:54:09,930 --> 01:54:11,390
Holy fuck!

1874
01:54:20,510 --> 01:54:22,230
Oh my god!

1875
01:54:22,390 --> 01:54:24,450
I feel like I'm playing Battlefield 3!

1876
01:54:25,070 --> 01:54:26,010
Is there anything?

1877
01:54:27,290 --> 01:54:29,210
Is there any... Oh my god, there's blueberries!

1878
01:54:30,070 --> 01:54:32,110
I'm gonna steal your clothes, I'm sorry!

1879
01:54:32,930 --> 01:54:35,190
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry!

1880
01:54:35,430 --> 01:54:36,450
I need something!

1881
01:54:38,770 --> 01:54:40,830
Oh my god!

1882
01:54:46,030 --> 01:54:46,830
What?!

1883
01:54:46,830 --> 01:54:49,490
What is going on?!

1884
01:54:49,490 --> 01:54:49,750
What?!

1885
01:54:55,210 --> 01:54:56,390
That's good, baby.

1886
01:54:57,950 --> 01:54:59,530
I think I'm dying!

1887
01:55:05,170 --> 01:55:07,770
I'm going through a lot right now!

1888
01:55:09,610 --> 01:55:12,810
I don't have... I don't have a gun!

1889
01:55:17,880 --> 01:55:21,300
What if I just... Oh, I just wanna take that gun!

1890
01:55:21,300 --> 01:55:23,940
I feel like a journalist right now!

1891
01:55:23,940 --> 01:55:26,220
I'm just... I'm just...

1892
01:55:33,520 --> 01:55:36,720
I feel like... I feel like I'm just spectating!

1893
01:55:43,120 --> 01:55:43,640
Wait...

1894
01:55:45,580 --> 01:55:46,720
Oh, what?!

1895
01:55:49,590 --> 01:55:50,050
Bow!

1896
01:55:51,310 --> 01:55:52,350
Oh, no!

1897
01:55:54,010 --> 01:55:57,350
I was like, wait a minute, is he like, part of my team?

1898
01:55:57,390 --> 01:55:58,150
He has a bow!

1899
01:55:58,150 --> 01:55:59,890
And I was like, wait, no!

1900
01:56:04,210 --> 01:56:06,190
I was so confused!

1901
01:56:06,850 --> 01:56:09,610
I was like, wait a minute, no, we killed this guy before!

1902
01:56:15,830 --> 01:56:17,290
Aren't you part of the war?

1903
01:56:26,210 --> 01:56:28,290
This is Doki reporting live!

1904
01:56:28,290 --> 01:56:34,790
We called Doki reporting for the war!

1905
01:56:36,290 --> 01:56:39,270
He's just relaxing!

1906
01:56:40,030 --> 01:56:41,480
What is going on?!

1907
01:56:41,890 --> 01:56:44,510
When does the war end?!

1908
01:56:44,510 --> 01:56:47,250
Bros just chill like that!

1909
01:56:51,080 --> 01:56:52,650
Union rules!

1910
01:57:03,830 --> 01:57:05,450
He enjoyed that!

1911
01:57:05,570 --> 01:57:06,650
He's just chilling!

1912
01:57:07,610 --> 01:57:09,730
The father was just chilling!

1913
01:57:10,270 --> 01:57:12,950
Also, Serpentine, thank you for the 25 gifted subs!

1914
01:57:13,090 --> 01:57:14,030
Thank you, thank you!

1915
01:57:34,600 --> 01:57:37,900
This is Doki reporting from the Great...

1916
01:57:37,900 --> 01:57:39,920
The Great Ted War!

1917
01:57:41,240 --> 01:57:43,900
Here we are capturing a live...

1918
01:57:43,900 --> 01:57:47,140
A live motivation music session!

1919
01:58:03,180 --> 01:58:05,120
In order to boost morale!

1920
01:58:05,960 --> 01:58:09,800
We are here with one of the many musicians from the war!

1921
01:58:14,860 --> 01:58:15,600
The bard!

1922
01:58:16,040 --> 01:58:17,480
The bard is here!

1923
01:58:24,970 --> 01:58:26,880
The song of war!

1924
01:58:27,860 --> 01:58:29,520
Wait, is that... are you friend?

1925
01:58:30,940 --> 01:58:32,400
We'll never know!

1926
01:58:32,520 --> 01:58:35,160
I don't know who's friend and who's not friend!

1927
01:58:43,070 --> 01:58:44,910
I'm heading back!

1928
01:58:51,040 --> 01:58:52,680
Oh my god!

1929
01:58:59,710 --> 01:59:00,610
Oh my god!

1930
01:59:03,490 --> 01:59:05,330
Oh my god!

1931
01:59:06,330 --> 01:59:08,570
Oh, I'm scared!

1932
01:59:09,970 --> 01:59:11,790
I'm so scared!

1933
01:59:16,970 --> 01:59:23,170
Where the fuck... where are guns?!

1934
01:59:25,970 --> 01:59:29,310
Oh my god, where are...

1935
01:59:29,310 --> 01:59:31,250
Where are guns?!

1936
01:59:31,250 --> 01:59:32,750
Where are anything?!

1937
01:59:36,470 --> 01:59:37,190
Jesus Christ!

1938
01:59:38,570 --> 01:59:39,010
Is this a gun?

1939
01:59:39,270 --> 01:59:39,970
What am I holding?

1940
01:59:40,110 --> 01:59:40,530
What am I holding?

1941
01:59:42,310 --> 01:59:43,490
Where is anything?

1942
01:59:43,770 --> 01:59:44,770
Where is any...

1943
01:59:44,770 --> 01:59:46,150
Oh my god, at least there's an arrow.

1944
01:59:46,550 --> 01:59:50,330
Why is it every time I press escape it fucking tells me out?!

1945
01:59:53,810 --> 01:59:55,870
I'm with you, I'm with you, I'm with you, I'm with you!

1946
01:59:55,870 --> 01:59:57,530
Who is this?

1947
02:00:01,930 --> 02:00:06,870
Oh my god, is there any form of weapon anywhere?!

1948
02:00:08,290 --> 02:00:08,810
Yeah, come here.

1949
02:00:10,450 --> 02:00:11,350
You need a weapon?

1950
02:00:11,510 --> 02:00:11,690
Come here.

1951
02:00:14,170 --> 02:00:15,290
Friendly, friendly, friendly!

1952
02:00:15,530 --> 02:00:16,350
Coming up, coming up!

1953
02:00:16,430 --> 02:00:17,290
Friendly, friendly, friendly!

1954
02:00:17,790 --> 02:00:18,510
What's up, guys?

1955
02:00:20,330 --> 02:00:21,650
Oh, thank you, thank you!

1956
02:00:22,270 --> 02:00:22,850
What's up, man?

1957
02:00:22,850 --> 02:00:23,830
Thank you.

1958
02:00:25,730 --> 02:00:27,850
Oh fuck, no, I just...

1959
02:00:29,230 --> 02:00:31,750
I literally just got it!

1960
02:00:32,170 --> 02:00:35,110
Where did I get shot from?!

1961
02:00:39,540 --> 02:00:41,160
I'm so mad!

1962
02:00:41,820 --> 02:00:44,300
I never got a chance to shoot a guy!

1963
02:00:47,640 --> 02:00:50,240
The first time I touched metal!

1964
02:00:56,170 --> 02:01:01,230
The very first time I've ever got a chance to touch a gun!

1965
02:01:01,770 --> 02:01:03,550
The one time!

1966
02:01:04,730 --> 02:01:09,990
So, I'm gonna fucking... I'm gonna fucking defect if I have to do this one more time.

1967
02:01:17,570 --> 02:01:23,230
I swear to god, I'm this close to defecting.

1968
02:01:29,670 --> 02:01:33,110
This war, this fucking war, I'm...

1969
02:01:38,170 --> 02:01:44,350
Oh my god, I should get journalistic immunity at this point.

1970
02:01:49,070 --> 02:01:55,430
I should just commit to being a journalist.

1971
02:01:55,750 --> 02:01:58,750
I don't even know!

1972
02:01:59,190 --> 02:02:00,890
I can't tell anymore!

1973
02:02:02,870 --> 02:02:05,250
When will it stop?!

1974
02:02:05,250 --> 02:02:06,030
I did!

1975
02:02:06,530 --> 02:02:10,870
The moment I picked up a gun, my journalistic immunity stopped!

1976
02:02:16,150 --> 02:02:17,850
What the fuck?

1977
02:02:20,090 --> 02:02:21,150
I'm just a meat shield.

1978
02:02:21,610 --> 02:02:22,810
I am!

1979
02:02:23,050 --> 02:02:24,830
I am just a meat shield!

1980
02:02:26,010 --> 02:02:27,990
I need the press badges!

1981
02:02:28,990 --> 02:02:30,810
Oh wait, that's not Ted?

1982
02:02:32,130 --> 02:02:34,570
Why is there a fucking bear?

1983
02:02:35,030 --> 02:02:37,590
Why is there a bear here?

1984
02:02:41,870 --> 02:02:44,290
The wall, the wall 300 is not us, I don't think.

1985
02:02:46,570 --> 02:02:48,310
Yo, yo, yo, yo, what's up?

1986
02:02:48,710 --> 02:02:50,730
Holy shit, man, who are we shooting at?

1987
02:02:52,070 --> 02:02:53,350
Wait, they changed the arm.

1988
02:02:56,250 --> 02:02:56,870
Where's the enemies?

1989
02:03:01,130 --> 02:03:02,070
It's a sign.

1990
02:03:03,170 --> 02:03:04,630
It's a sign for me to...

1991
02:03:06,050 --> 02:03:07,310
Okay, we can go back.

1992
02:03:09,650 --> 02:03:11,450
What's going on?

1993
02:03:12,070 --> 02:03:15,850
I'm trying to head back to my people!

1994
02:03:17,170 --> 02:03:19,310
This has been a crazy war.

1995
02:03:22,970 --> 02:03:25,590
This really has been a crazy...

1996
02:03:26,310 --> 02:03:26,450
Oh,

1997
02:03:29,730 --> 02:03:30,530
that's them.

1998
02:03:31,110 --> 02:03:32,250
That's them.

1999
02:03:32,570 --> 02:03:34,330
That's them over there.

2000
02:03:34,450 --> 02:03:35,190
That's them!

2001
02:03:36,010 --> 02:03:37,310
You think they saw me?

2002
02:03:37,750 --> 02:03:38,770
You think they saw me?

2003
02:03:39,150 --> 02:03:40,430
I don't think they saw me.

2004
02:03:40,690 --> 02:03:43,190
I... I don't think...

2005
02:03:47,430 --> 02:03:49,850
Oh my god, they almost saw me.

2006
02:03:50,010 --> 02:03:51,250
They almost saw me.

2007
02:03:51,330 --> 02:03:54,490
No, I was not gonna use my rock against those people!

2008
02:03:55,050 --> 02:03:56,810
They're fucking animals!

2009
02:03:59,950 --> 02:04:01,810
I was not gonna survive.

2010
02:04:02,270 --> 02:04:03,730
And you know it.

2011
02:04:03,730 --> 02:04:07,070
You fucking know I was not gonna survive.

2012
02:04:13,980 --> 02:04:15,800
What's going on?

2013
02:04:29,380 --> 02:04:30,540
What's going on?

2014
02:04:30,960 --> 02:04:31,480
Oh!

2015
02:04:33,980 --> 02:04:35,920
Oh my god, he broke his own car!

2016
02:04:36,180 --> 02:04:37,120
He broke his own car!

2017
02:04:37,120 --> 02:04:39,080
I don't have the car!

2018
02:04:39,140 --> 02:04:39,880
What's going on?

2019
02:04:39,900 --> 02:04:40,520
Don't let him in!

2020
02:04:41,040 --> 02:04:42,340
Don't open it!

2021
02:04:42,440 --> 02:04:42,920
Don't open it!

2022
02:04:43,020 --> 02:04:44,080
Don't open it!

2023
02:04:44,260 --> 02:04:45,380
Do not open!

2024
02:04:45,520 --> 02:04:46,300
Do not open!

2025
02:04:46,740 --> 02:04:47,560
There's too many!

2026
02:04:47,820 --> 02:04:48,240
There's too many!

2027
02:04:48,980 --> 02:04:50,480
There's goddamn zombies out here!

2028
02:04:51,420 --> 02:04:51,860
Coral!

2029
02:04:51,860 --> 02:04:52,300
Coral!

2030
02:04:52,300 --> 02:04:53,760
The walkers are everywhere!

2031
02:04:54,280 --> 02:04:54,540
Coral!

2032
02:04:54,660 --> 02:04:55,600
I can't!

2033
02:04:56,100 --> 02:04:57,220
I need my revenge!

2034
02:04:58,040 --> 02:04:58,860
He had a car!

2035
02:04:59,040 --> 02:05:00,620
I have to be... I have to be careful!

2036
02:05:01,220 --> 02:05:02,220
He had a car!

2037
02:05:02,720 --> 02:05:04,340
I didn't want him to run me over!

2038
02:05:04,340 --> 02:05:04,800
I...

2039
02:05:08,660 --> 02:05:10,180
Oh my god.

2040
02:05:11,580 --> 02:05:14,560
Oh my god, what's going on anymore?

2041
02:05:14,820 --> 02:05:16,340
Wait, I...

2042
02:05:17,180 --> 02:05:18,040
Oh shit!

2043
02:05:19,360 --> 02:05:20,080
Just get in!

2044
02:05:20,220 --> 02:05:21,360
Okay, lock it, lock it!

2045
02:05:21,460 --> 02:05:22,560
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

2046
02:05:23,040 --> 02:05:23,540
Drive!

2047
02:05:23,980 --> 02:05:24,480
Drive!

2048
02:05:24,620 --> 02:05:24,740
Drive!

2049
02:05:24,880 --> 02:05:26,060
What's going on?

2050
02:05:26,420 --> 02:05:28,760
I feel so scared!

2051
02:05:31,220 --> 02:05:32,320
Let him come over, Chip!

2052
02:05:32,820 --> 02:05:33,360
He's right there!

2053
02:05:36,920 --> 02:05:39,520
I didn't even...

2054
02:05:39,520 --> 02:05:40,040
No!

2055
02:05:40,700 --> 02:05:43,360
They destroyed the beds!

2056
02:05:43,980 --> 02:05:46,680
They destroyed the beds!

2057
02:05:47,300 --> 02:05:50,340
They actually destroyed the beds!

2058
02:05:51,340 --> 02:05:53,520
Oh my god!

2059
02:05:54,140 --> 02:05:56,900
Fucking madmen!

2060
02:06:00,700 --> 02:06:02,060
We'll go to Hannah Montana.

2061
02:06:02,220 --> 02:06:02,840
War is over.

2062
02:06:03,360 --> 02:06:05,500
I didn't... I was... I didn't want him to look at me!

2063
02:06:05,500 --> 02:06:06,540
He had a gun!

2064
02:06:07,080 --> 02:06:08,020
He had a gun!

2065
02:06:08,380 --> 02:06:10,780
I was hoping he didn't see me!

2066
02:06:11,680 --> 02:06:12,140
Alright.

2067
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:14,280
Back to...

2068
02:06:14,280 --> 02:06:14,640
Oh.

2069
02:06:15,780 --> 02:06:16,480
Oh.

2070
02:06:17,600 --> 02:06:19,240
I'm trapped here.

2071
02:06:23,500 --> 02:06:24,830
I forgot this.

2072
02:06:25,890 --> 02:06:27,430
I'm trapped here.

2073
02:06:27,530 --> 02:06:29,290
I don't have his password.

2074
02:06:30,150 --> 02:06:32,810
I don't have this guy's password.

2075
02:06:33,430 --> 02:06:33,830
Ah!

2076
02:06:35,810 --> 02:06:36,610
Okay.

2077
02:06:37,090 --> 02:06:37,570
Okay.

2078
02:06:38,230 --> 02:06:38,690
Alright.

2079
02:06:41,070 --> 02:06:41,870
Goodbye.

2080
02:06:42,750 --> 02:06:46,050
I can't live my Hannah Montana life.

2081
02:06:46,590 --> 02:06:47,910
I can't live my...

2082
02:06:48,430 --> 02:06:50,750
I gotta go back to progressive Valhalla.

2083
02:06:51,110 --> 02:06:53,530
But we're not even part of Valhalla anymore!

2084
02:06:53,910 --> 02:06:55,490
We're not even...

2085
02:06:55,490 --> 02:06:58,130
They destroyed... They destroyed our beds!

2086
02:06:59,310 --> 02:07:00,590
Those fucking monsters!

2087
02:07:00,590 --> 02:07:02,510
Yeah, they did!

2088
02:07:06,300 --> 02:07:07,500
Those monsters!

2089
02:07:08,220 --> 02:07:09,760
We will... We will rest.

2090
02:07:10,900 --> 02:07:12,080
Holy fuck, I'm tired.

2091
02:07:12,780 --> 02:07:16,280
Guys, what were we even fighting for in the end?

2092
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:19,280
What was the whole point in the end?

2093
02:07:19,960 --> 02:07:21,040
They attacked us first!

2094
02:07:22,020 --> 02:07:24,500
We... We were at their house.

2095
02:07:25,180 --> 02:07:29,480
I just wanted to live the simple life, man.

2096
02:07:35,040 --> 02:07:35,450
What...

2097
02:07:35,860 --> 02:07:37,980
What was it even for?

2098
02:07:38,700 --> 02:07:40,160
What was it?

2099
02:07:40,780 --> 02:07:41,360
Yeah?

2100
02:07:42,260 --> 02:07:43,600
They destroyed our beds!

2101
02:07:46,480 --> 02:07:48,080
What did they do?

2102
02:07:48,320 --> 02:07:50,140
They destroyed our beds!

2103
02:07:59,580 --> 02:08:00,900
Oh my god.

2104
02:08:00,900 --> 02:08:01,400
Oh my god.

2105
02:08:05,660 --> 02:08:07,160
From who?

2106
02:08:08,360 --> 02:08:09,360
Today?

2107
02:08:11,640 --> 02:08:12,360
Is he coming?

2108
02:08:12,660 --> 02:08:14,400
Are the gods coming today?

2109
02:08:16,440 --> 02:08:17,440
Oh...

2110
02:08:22,920 --> 02:08:23,290
Yeah...

2111
02:08:24,100 --> 02:08:24,840
Yeah...

2112
02:08:30,260 --> 02:08:31,740
Sorry, Odin...

2113
02:08:31,740 --> 02:08:34,920
Odin requires two to three business days, guys.

2114
02:08:35,120 --> 02:08:35,560
Oh...

2115
02:08:35,560 --> 02:08:38,440
Guys, we got...

2116
02:08:38,440 --> 02:08:40,820
We didn't invest in Amazon Prime.

2117
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:43,060
We didn't invest in Odin Prime, guys.

2118
02:08:44,060 --> 02:08:44,800
Sadly...

2119
02:08:44,800 --> 02:08:46,820
Sadly, we don't have Odin Prime.

2120
02:08:47,440 --> 02:08:48,180
So...

2121
02:08:48,180 --> 02:08:50,980
We just have it for two hours.

2122
02:08:52,440 --> 02:08:55,140
Alright, let's just grab some supplies.

2123
02:08:56,160 --> 02:08:58,000
And like explore a little.

2124
02:08:58,760 --> 02:08:59,740
I'm done with war.

2125
02:09:00,860 --> 02:09:04,000
I'm done... I'm fucking done with war.

2126
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:07,600
Which one was the food?

2127
02:09:07,780 --> 02:09:08,760
Okay, there it is.

2128
02:09:09,640 --> 02:09:10,080
Alright.

2129
02:09:10,620 --> 02:09:12,180
And then...

2130
02:09:13,320 --> 02:09:14,240
The arrows.

2131
02:09:15,500 --> 02:09:19,280
No same day... No same raven delivery, sadly.

2132
02:09:20,480 --> 02:09:22,140
We don't even have arrows!

2133
02:09:24,460 --> 02:09:27,000
We don't even have arrows!

2134
02:09:27,600 --> 02:09:31,260
Guys, the AK doesn't unlock until tomorrow, guys!

2135
02:09:31,460 --> 02:09:33,080
I'm gonna grab a horse.

2136
02:09:35,060 --> 02:09:36,420
I'm gonna grab a horse.

2137
02:09:37,000 --> 02:09:39,060
We have so many horses, guys.

2138
02:09:40,240 --> 02:09:43,320
Like, one horse gone wouldn't matter.

2139
02:09:47,160 --> 02:09:48,400
That's fine.

2140
02:09:48,600 --> 02:09:51,280
We've had a long day.

2141
02:09:52,120 --> 02:09:54,800
We had a very...

2142
02:09:55,680 --> 02:09:59,560
We had an incredibly long day, guys.

2143
02:10:00,380 --> 02:10:01,800
So it's time.

2144
02:10:02,200 --> 02:10:04,540
It's time to head off and travel.

2145
02:10:06,120 --> 02:10:09,880
But what if it's someone else's horse?

2146
02:10:09,960 --> 02:10:10,540
It's fine.

2147
02:10:11,460 --> 02:10:12,580
It's fine.

2148
02:10:14,640 --> 02:10:15,960
It's fine.

2149
02:10:17,180 --> 02:10:18,780
There's no... No.

2150
02:10:20,240 --> 02:10:21,580
There's no...

2151
02:10:41,320 --> 02:10:43,100
Today's a bad day.

2152
02:10:50,600 --> 02:10:53,920
Today's been a bad day.

2153
02:11:00,820 --> 02:11:04,380
It wasn't meant to be.

2154
02:11:04,860 --> 02:11:06,380
It wasn't.

2155
02:11:07,120 --> 02:11:09,640
It's a sign from the gods.

2156
02:11:10,740 --> 02:11:16,800
That today was gonna be a bad day for Doki at Rust.

2157
02:11:17,920 --> 02:11:19,060
Can't believe.

2158
02:11:20,260 --> 02:11:22,920
Can't believe all of that happened today.

2159
02:11:25,510 --> 02:11:27,530
I guess we'll just walk.

2160
02:11:27,950 --> 02:11:29,110
You know what?

2161
02:11:29,730 --> 02:11:30,750
Let's go gambling.

2162
02:11:31,570 --> 02:11:36,450
That's what I've wanted to do this entire time.

2163
02:11:39,890 --> 02:11:40,770
Nice.

2164
02:11:42,690 --> 02:11:46,010
I wanted to go... I initially logged in.

2165
02:11:47,510 --> 02:11:52,050
I initially logged in to fucking go gambling.

2166
02:11:52,330 --> 02:11:54,810
And I'm gonna fucking go gambling.

2167
02:11:55,350 --> 02:11:57,730
Yeah, I just got four dollars.

2168
02:11:59,410 --> 02:12:01,460
That's all I wanted.

2169
02:12:03,770 --> 02:12:06,190
That's all I wanted.

2170
02:12:08,330 --> 02:12:14,170
My fucking side quest took me out of gambling.

2171
02:12:14,170 --> 02:12:16,810
But the side quest was over.

2172
02:12:17,230 --> 02:12:19,590
I can finally go gamble.

2173
02:12:21,970 --> 02:12:27,570
Instead of... Instead of gambling my scrap.

2174
02:12:28,410 --> 02:12:31,830
I'm gambling... I had to gamble my life.

2175
02:12:32,770 --> 02:12:35,550
For some fucking guy named Ted.

2176
02:12:36,230 --> 02:12:37,610
Of all things.

2177
02:12:43,390 --> 02:12:47,530
And then just to have him be gunned down.

2178
02:12:47,870 --> 02:12:49,390
Just like that.

2179
02:12:49,970 --> 02:12:51,870
I could've just done that in the beginning.

2180
02:12:54,010 --> 02:12:57,030
I could've literally just killed him.

2181
02:13:04,570 --> 02:13:06,690
Alright, time to gamble.

2182
02:13:07,450 --> 02:13:09,990
I got one guy.

2183
02:13:12,670 --> 02:13:13,910
What a fucking war.

2184
02:13:14,770 --> 02:13:18,170
The war... What a fucking war.

2185
02:13:18,590 --> 02:13:22,650
I touched a... I got to touch a gun for one second.

2186
02:13:23,290 --> 02:13:26,490
And then the god smited me down.

2187
02:13:28,650 --> 02:13:32,230
I bet Sykkuno's stream was super chill compared to what I just went through.

2188
02:13:36,690 --> 02:13:40,090
His Drops Adventures was so much more chill.

2189
02:13:40,510 --> 02:13:43,770
I fucking woke up to a fucking war.

2190
02:13:50,980 --> 02:13:53,470
Alright, let's head... I'm starving.

2191
02:13:54,270 --> 02:13:55,210
God damn it.

2192
02:13:56,410 --> 02:13:57,490
Alright, nice.

2193
02:13:59,900 --> 02:14:02,170
I woke up and just got drafted.

2194
02:14:03,120 --> 02:14:04,150
Just like that.

2195
02:14:04,850 --> 02:14:06,250
I just got drafted.

2196
02:14:06,770 --> 02:14:08,030
Just like that.

2197
02:14:09,610 --> 02:14:11,530
They didn't even know what I signed up for.

2198
02:14:11,790 --> 02:14:15,830
They pulled my name out like it was fucking Hunger Games.

2199
02:14:16,490 --> 02:14:18,590
And then off I go to war.

2200
02:14:19,250 --> 02:14:20,650
There we go, I see the world.

2201
02:14:22,570 --> 02:14:23,650
I'm gonna kill this chicken.

2202
02:14:24,370 --> 02:14:25,190
This is you, Dragoons.

2203
02:14:25,310 --> 02:14:25,730
This is you.

2204
02:14:26,010 --> 02:14:27,310
I'm putting my anger out on you.

2205
02:14:31,330 --> 02:14:31,770
No!

2206
02:14:33,130 --> 02:14:34,030
It's fucking right.

2207
02:14:35,190 --> 02:14:36,570
That's fucking right.

2208
02:14:37,030 --> 02:14:38,390
I'm going to war.

2209
02:14:38,570 --> 02:14:40,180
I'm coming back with PTSD now.

2210
02:14:45,770 --> 02:14:48,510
I'm coming back with PTSD from the war.

2211
02:14:49,090 --> 02:14:49,790
Nice.

2212
02:14:51,390 --> 02:14:51,790
Alright.

2213
02:14:52,910 --> 02:14:53,890
Let's see.

2214
02:14:54,870 --> 02:14:56,830
Oh, the casino's so far.

2215
02:14:56,970 --> 02:15:01,030
Why did we build a base so far from the casino?

2216
02:15:07,510 --> 02:15:09,150
PTSD is real.

2217
02:15:09,450 --> 02:15:12,490
Sorry, I thought you were one of the people I fought before.

2218
02:15:13,030 --> 02:15:14,290
I thought you...

2219
02:15:14,290 --> 02:15:20,150
I heard a loud sound and I thought I was transported back into the battlefield.

2220
02:15:21,450 --> 02:15:23,210
It was that bad, guys.

2221
02:15:24,090 --> 02:15:25,730
That was how bad it was.

2222
02:15:26,530 --> 02:15:28,890
That was how bad it was.

2223
02:15:30,230 --> 02:15:32,250
Shouldn't have made that sound, Dragoons.

2224
02:15:36,260 --> 02:15:36,940
Alright.

2225
02:15:37,620 --> 02:15:38,500
Off I go.

2226
02:15:38,780 --> 02:15:41,120
I wonder if I'll ever see Mr. Zealand again.

2227
02:15:41,780 --> 02:15:42,740
Mr. New Zealand.

2228
02:15:44,120 --> 02:15:46,700
What the fuck is this?

2229
02:15:47,480 --> 02:15:49,560
Is this the Iron Throne?

2230
02:15:54,560 --> 02:15:55,920
I should...

2231
02:15:55,920 --> 02:15:58,180
Wait, this is the Iron...

2232
02:16:02,820 --> 02:16:04,020
My throne now.

2233
02:16:07,000 --> 02:16:08,200
I was the true...

2234
02:16:09,260 --> 02:16:10,920
The real queen.

2235
02:16:12,100 --> 02:16:13,220
Where is everyone?

2236
02:16:13,720 --> 02:16:14,920
They're back at...

2237
02:16:14,920 --> 02:16:16,920
They're back at base here.

2238
02:16:17,120 --> 02:16:19,180
They're having another meeting, I'm pretty sure.

2239
02:16:19,460 --> 02:16:23,100
And then there's Ted and Dak in here fucking, I guess.

2240
02:16:23,100 --> 02:16:24,100
It's like...

2241
02:16:31,980 --> 02:16:33,260
In the...

2242
02:16:33,260 --> 02:16:35,600
Either the Janet or the foolish home.

2243
02:16:35,680 --> 02:16:36,940
Whichever one it is.

2244
02:16:38,020 --> 02:16:38,660
Whichever...

2245
02:16:39,900 --> 02:16:40,540
Sorry.

2246
02:16:41,000 --> 02:16:42,500
Sorry, I meant like...

2247
02:16:42,500 --> 02:16:45,320
There's Ted and Dak doing what bros do.

2248
02:16:46,260 --> 02:16:49,780
I mean, there's a fucking whole meeting with the Lurklings here.

2249
02:16:50,180 --> 02:16:52,420
And it's somehow Dak and Ted are here.

2250
02:16:53,100 --> 02:16:55,080
So like, just bros being bros.

2251
02:16:55,680 --> 02:16:56,780
Oh wait, what?

2252
02:16:56,880 --> 02:16:57,700
Is this Military Town?

2253
02:16:59,040 --> 02:17:00,160
Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2254
02:17:00,200 --> 02:17:01,140
That's Military Town.

2255
02:17:01,300 --> 02:17:01,720
That's fine.

2256
02:17:01,780 --> 02:17:03,180
A little radiation doesn't hurt anybody.

2257
02:17:03,700 --> 02:17:04,660
It's fucking fine.

2258
02:17:04,960 --> 02:17:06,260
It's just a little radiation.

2259
02:17:09,500 --> 02:17:11,260
Look what happened to Spider-Man!

2260
02:17:13,020 --> 02:17:15,240
They're strengthening their bonds, exactly.

2261
02:17:15,360 --> 02:17:16,860
Look what happened to Spider-Man!

2262
02:17:19,200 --> 02:17:21,620
A little radiation made him into Spider-Man.

2263
02:17:23,100 --> 02:17:24,380
Made him into fucking Bear-Man.

2264
02:17:27,120 --> 02:17:28,120
That's fine.

2265
02:17:28,280 --> 02:17:29,300
It's raining anyway.

2266
02:17:29,580 --> 02:17:32,340
I'm just grabbing scrap for my gambling addiction.

2267
02:17:33,440 --> 02:17:34,700
That I'm gonna start now.

2268
02:17:34,960 --> 02:17:36,940
I'm gonna start my gambling addiction today.

2269
02:17:37,680 --> 02:17:38,180
I'm...

2270
02:17:40,960 --> 02:17:42,880
You all know when to start.

2271
02:17:43,080 --> 02:17:44,600
And today's that day.

2272
02:17:46,040 --> 02:17:49,140
Today's that day where I'm gonna start my gambling addiction.

2273
02:17:52,700 --> 02:17:53,080
Alright.

2274
02:17:54,660 --> 02:17:56,280
Never too late to start, exactly.

2275
02:17:57,600 --> 02:17:59,160
Never too late to start.

2276
02:18:00,820 --> 02:18:02,980
I heard how fun gambling was.

2277
02:18:03,420 --> 02:18:04,620
In-game, by the way.

2278
02:18:05,020 --> 02:18:06,100
In-game.

2279
02:18:06,520 --> 02:18:07,440
What do you mean I have a problem?

2280
02:18:07,560 --> 02:18:09,080
I literally started today!

2281
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:13,420
Wait until tomorrow when I actually do have a problem.

2282
02:18:15,720 --> 02:18:16,180
Okay.

2283
02:18:17,260 --> 02:18:17,820
Here we go.

2284
02:18:18,200 --> 02:18:18,460
Whoa!

2285
02:18:18,780 --> 02:18:20,500
Oh my god, you scared me.

2286
02:18:22,640 --> 02:18:23,660
It's all good.

2287
02:18:24,160 --> 02:18:26,200
It's usually me getting scared.

2288
02:18:26,480 --> 02:18:29,480
Oh, are you collecting scrap for your gambling addiction too?

2289
02:18:31,620 --> 02:18:34,160
Oh no, I'm not a wheelhead, but I get it.

2290
02:18:34,200 --> 02:18:35,380
Wait, is that what they call them?

2291
02:18:35,640 --> 02:18:36,560
I'm collecting for the blood god.

2292
02:18:37,780 --> 02:18:38,020
Yup.

2293
02:18:39,100 --> 02:18:39,540
Wheelheads?

2294
02:18:39,820 --> 02:18:40,260
You know what?

2295
02:18:41,580 --> 02:18:43,160
Yup, you probably need it a little bit.

2296
02:18:43,260 --> 02:18:43,760
Oh, nevermind.

2297
02:18:44,620 --> 02:18:46,940
There's 22 and then there's a stop sign.

2298
02:18:47,000 --> 02:18:47,940
I'm not a wheelhead.

2299
02:18:48,060 --> 02:18:49,960
I swear, I'm not a wheelhead.

2300
02:18:50,740 --> 02:18:52,500
I'm just starting today.

2301
02:18:55,440 --> 02:18:58,660
The blood god loves you nonetheless.

2302
02:18:59,240 --> 02:19:00,200
That's a gift from him.

2303
02:19:01,310 --> 02:19:03,440
I swear, I don't have a problem.

2304
02:19:04,310 --> 02:19:05,580
It's just one, right?

2305
02:19:06,180 --> 02:19:10,360
If I do it once, it's not a sin.

2306
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:17,440
Just one spin.

2307
02:19:18,360 --> 02:19:20,220
That doesn't make me a wheelhead.

2308
02:19:20,500 --> 02:19:21,480
Are you doing your free time?

2309
02:19:22,580 --> 02:19:24,680
No, no, surely not.

2310
02:19:25,020 --> 02:19:29,900
I mean, to be honest, once you start to get looking like that train wreck fella...

2311
02:19:29,900 --> 02:19:33,140
I mean, he's more than a wheelhead.

2312
02:19:33,680 --> 02:19:34,980
Wait, what is he?

2313
02:19:35,280 --> 02:19:36,660
Wait, what is he?

2314
02:19:38,180 --> 02:19:40,000
There's something beyond wheelhead?

2315
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:41,140
Like, you know how we...

2316
02:19:43,380 --> 02:19:47,200
He's... I mean, he is the head of house DJing claw.

2317
02:19:47,360 --> 02:19:58,780
I mean, you really couldn't name him anything more appropriate than just a downright, dirty, degenerate, slot machine, odds gambling lover.

2318
02:19:59,500 --> 02:20:01,320
But, you know what?

2319
02:20:01,860 --> 02:20:05,360
Despite all those words that the blood god has, we don't judge him.

2320
02:20:05,800 --> 02:20:07,340
Blood god loves all.

2321
02:20:07,500 --> 02:20:08,360
Is that right?

2322
02:20:10,000 --> 02:20:10,900
Y 'all got blood on us.

2323
02:20:11,240 --> 02:20:12,040
Even for train wreck.

2324
02:20:12,200 --> 02:20:12,240
Yup.

2325
02:20:12,640 --> 02:20:14,600
Yeah, I thought his blood got replaced.

2326
02:20:14,820 --> 02:20:16,860
I heard his blood got replaced by other substances.

2327
02:20:19,000 --> 02:20:22,240
You think he's got, like, silver and gold?

2328
02:20:22,520 --> 02:20:22,620
Yeah.

2329
02:20:22,620 --> 02:20:25,800
Just little things that he can extract and sell so he can spin that wheel one more time?

2330
02:20:25,820 --> 02:20:27,420
Exactly, how would he be able to keep spinning?

2331
02:20:29,920 --> 02:20:31,460
Have you ever looked inside his body?

2332
02:20:31,460 --> 02:20:33,540
It would make sense that he's selling his body.

2333
02:20:33,920 --> 02:20:34,240
Yeah.

2334
02:20:34,480 --> 02:20:35,360
Yup, yup.

2335
02:20:35,360 --> 02:20:41,480
Yeah, that's how, I mean, who keeps, how is he getting all that scrap to spin that wheel?

2336
02:20:43,360 --> 02:20:45,000
Gotta be selling his body.

2337
02:20:45,300 --> 02:20:48,640
The blood inside of him, the gold, I don't know, I don't know what he does.

2338
02:20:48,860 --> 02:20:49,360
But you know what?

2339
02:20:49,820 --> 02:20:52,840
Even if he does all that, it's still love.

2340
02:20:53,360 --> 02:20:56,400
Just like we love you, even though you might be a wheelhead.

2341
02:20:56,580 --> 02:20:58,100
But you might not be.

2342
02:20:58,900 --> 02:20:59,860
Nobody's saying it.

2343
02:20:59,980 --> 02:21:00,500
Only you know.

2344
02:21:01,560 --> 02:21:02,680
Only you know.

2345
02:21:02,680 --> 02:21:05,800
Yeah, yeah, and I know in my heart...

2346
02:21:08,020 --> 02:21:10,220
You think the blood god was angry?

2347
02:21:11,960 --> 02:21:13,220
Why was he angry?

2348
02:21:13,820 --> 02:21:19,560
Science men, they're trying to spread their word of logic.

2349
02:21:21,300 --> 02:21:25,800
Truth is what they say, but between you and me, we all know that's bullshit.

2350
02:21:29,260 --> 02:21:30,460
Vaccines, math.

2351
02:21:30,460 --> 02:21:34,300
Yeah, like how the plague isn't real.

2352
02:21:35,500 --> 02:21:38,200
I know, that's why we don't wear masks, right?

2353
02:21:38,500 --> 02:21:39,740
Wait, but you're wearing a mask.

2354
02:21:40,520 --> 02:21:40,660
Yup.

2355
02:21:41,300 --> 02:21:43,280
So, you believe then.

2356
02:21:45,860 --> 02:21:46,880
I'm trying to...

2357
02:21:46,880 --> 02:21:48,020
Take off your mask.

2358
02:21:48,720 --> 02:21:48,940
Yup.

2359
02:21:52,660 --> 02:21:53,220
Oh!

2360
02:21:53,720 --> 02:21:54,480
Oh, come on.

2361
02:21:54,620 --> 02:21:54,920
Wait.

2362
02:21:55,080 --> 02:21:55,480
Drop your shit.

2363
02:21:55,740 --> 02:21:56,880
Drop your shit.

2364
02:21:57,400 --> 02:21:57,960
Wait.

2365
02:21:58,000 --> 02:21:58,360
Drop your shit.

2366
02:21:58,360 --> 02:22:00,580
We were just murdering together.

2367
02:22:00,580 --> 02:22:02,980
We were having a conversation.

2368
02:22:04,220 --> 02:22:06,460
Oh, you want to see my dumbass peanuts, don't you?

2369
02:22:07,220 --> 02:22:08,220
I need food.

2370
02:22:08,860 --> 02:22:09,460
Do you have food?

2371
02:22:09,560 --> 02:22:10,020
Do you have food?

2372
02:22:10,140 --> 02:22:10,540
I need food.

2373
02:22:11,020 --> 02:22:13,040
What about some cloth?

2374
02:22:13,320 --> 02:22:13,720
Cloth!

2375
02:22:14,020 --> 02:22:14,400
Cloth!

2376
02:22:15,260 --> 02:22:16,000
I don't have...

2377
02:22:16,000 --> 02:22:16,880
I have...

2378
02:22:16,880 --> 02:22:18,140
I just have one.

2379
02:22:18,800 --> 02:22:19,300
Take some of that.

2380
02:22:21,020 --> 02:22:22,180
Cheers, bitch.

2381
02:22:22,780 --> 02:22:23,560
Oh, shit.

2382
02:22:24,040 --> 02:22:25,260
You need a bandage?

2383
02:22:25,260 --> 02:22:26,600
You shot me in the...

2384
02:22:27,160 --> 02:22:27,720
Yup.

2385
02:22:58,240 --> 02:23:00,480
I'm alive!

2386
02:23:03,430 --> 02:23:03,890
Wow!

2387
02:23:06,110 --> 02:23:07,250
It's been a wild...

2388
02:23:07,690 --> 02:23:10,110
It's been a wild two hours.

2389
02:23:10,830 --> 02:23:12,310
It's been a wild...

2390
02:23:12,310 --> 02:23:14,950
The journalist doesn't die.

2391
02:23:15,510 --> 02:23:16,530
It's all about...

2392
02:23:17,410 --> 02:23:19,190
Journalistic integrity.

2393
02:23:21,010 --> 02:23:23,290
Reporting live on...

2394
02:23:24,110 --> 02:23:27,150
Reporting live in Rust Kingdoms 2.

2395
02:23:28,070 --> 02:23:29,410
A true survivor.

2396
02:23:35,290 --> 02:23:38,270
Oh my god, I went through so much.

2397
02:23:38,630 --> 02:23:41,650
I went through so much.

2398
02:23:43,150 --> 02:23:44,910
Alright, I gotta do...

2399
02:23:44,910 --> 02:23:47,470
I need to go through this way to get to the casino.

2400
02:23:49,230 --> 02:23:50,670
Oh my god.

2401
02:23:51,510 --> 02:23:52,710
That was crazy.

2402
02:23:53,090 --> 02:23:53,910
I left...

2403
02:23:53,910 --> 02:23:56,370
I survived to tell the tale.

2404
02:23:58,230 --> 02:23:59,490
The report...

2405
02:23:59,490 --> 02:24:00,610
Reporting live.

2406
02:24:01,610 --> 02:24:02,090
Alright.

2407
02:24:02,510 --> 02:24:03,790
Let's end it with some gambling.

2408
02:24:03,990 --> 02:24:04,790
At least I...

2409
02:24:04,790 --> 02:24:06,710
I got to keep my scrap.

2410
02:24:07,150 --> 02:24:07,950
Thank god.

2411
02:24:11,640 --> 02:24:14,120
Expecting trauma at every fucking turn.

2412
02:24:20,160 --> 02:24:21,400
It's a sign.

2413
02:24:21,900 --> 02:24:23,620
It's a sign, chat.

2414
02:24:23,940 --> 02:24:27,000
It's a sign that I must gamble with the scrap.

2415
02:24:27,240 --> 02:24:29,460
He died giving me the scrap.

2416
02:24:29,460 --> 02:24:30,520
I'm not a wheelhead, guys.

2417
02:24:30,620 --> 02:24:31,400
I'm not a wheelhead.

2418
02:24:31,620 --> 02:24:34,360
But he died giving me the scrap.

2419
02:24:34,620 --> 02:24:38,600
In his final words, he told me to spin that wheel.

2420
02:24:40,840 --> 02:24:41,480
Ooh.

2421
02:24:42,440 --> 02:24:43,800
Are you a wheelhead?

2422
02:24:47,380 --> 02:24:47,640
Alright.

2423
02:24:48,400 --> 02:24:49,920
How long you been here?

2424
02:24:50,740 --> 02:24:51,920
Spinning that wheel.

2425
02:24:55,740 --> 02:24:57,200
You just got here?

2426
02:24:57,380 --> 02:24:59,060
How much scrap have you spent?

2427
02:25:04,670 --> 02:25:05,310
Overall?

2428
02:25:05,630 --> 02:25:06,410
No, overall.

2429
02:25:06,670 --> 02:25:07,090
I'm curious.

2430
02:25:07,450 --> 02:25:08,590
This is my first day.

2431
02:25:09,050 --> 02:25:09,990
Spinning that wheel.

2432
02:25:19,540 --> 02:25:21,720
Wait, you can look at how much you spend?

2433
02:25:22,560 --> 02:25:23,320
8 ,000.

2434
02:25:23,320 --> 02:25:25,040
8,000?!

2435
02:25:27,140 --> 02:25:28,280
3, 3, 3.

2436
02:25:28,320 --> 02:25:29,100
Oh, oh.

2437
02:25:29,220 --> 02:25:30,040
I mean...

2438
02:25:34,800 --> 02:25:35,440
What's your...

2439
02:25:35,440 --> 02:25:36,200
That would be bad too.

2440
02:25:40,000 --> 02:25:40,500
Alright.

2441
02:25:40,760 --> 02:25:42,300
That's a wheelhead right there.

2442
02:25:42,500 --> 02:25:43,000
That's...

2443
02:25:43,000 --> 02:25:44,040
He warned me.

2444
02:25:44,500 --> 02:25:45,040
He warned...

2445
02:25:45,040 --> 02:25:48,340
I was getting my 30 scrap.

2446
02:25:48,540 --> 02:25:50,680
I had 30 scrap.

2447
02:25:54,280 --> 02:25:57,860
This guy was like, 3,000.

2448
02:25:58,060 --> 02:25:58,660
Oh, nice.

2449
02:26:01,780 --> 02:26:03,320
I got two.

2450
02:26:05,060 --> 02:26:05,700
Alright.

2451
02:26:05,840 --> 02:26:06,380
You know what?

2452
02:26:08,100 --> 02:26:08,760
All in.

2453
02:26:09,200 --> 02:26:10,720
Wait, we actually...

2454
02:26:10,720 --> 02:26:12,340
Plus one over here.

2455
02:26:13,020 --> 02:26:13,500
You know what?

2456
02:26:13,500 --> 02:26:15,460
The final spin.

2457
02:26:16,000 --> 02:26:17,340
Right here.

2458
02:26:18,240 --> 02:26:19,800
Guys, right here.

2459
02:26:21,040 --> 02:26:22,560
The final spin.

2460
02:26:24,480 --> 02:26:26,600
That man gave me his scrap.

2461
02:26:28,260 --> 02:26:29,880
For this very...

2462
02:26:29,880 --> 02:26:31,600
This very spin right here.

2463
02:26:32,700 --> 02:26:33,420
All in, babe.

2464
02:26:33,440 --> 02:26:34,520
What's the worst that could happen?

2465
02:26:35,120 --> 02:26:36,640
I lose it all and I fucking...

2466
02:26:37,740 --> 02:26:38,800
Slash kill?

2467
02:26:41,680 --> 02:26:42,440
No.

2468
02:26:46,720 --> 02:26:48,040
There's no way.

2469
02:26:54,010 --> 02:26:55,130
There's no way.

2470
02:26:55,730 --> 02:26:56,730
There's no way.

2471
02:26:57,510 --> 02:26:58,750
There's no way.

2472
02:26:59,510 --> 02:27:00,690
It's still going, guys.

2473
02:27:00,730 --> 02:27:01,430
There's still hope.

2474
02:27:02,290 --> 02:27:05,750
This is the longest fucking spinning wheel I've ever seen.

2475
02:27:18,230 --> 02:27:20,910
I hope Abby remembers this day.

2476
02:27:29,410 --> 02:27:32,450
I hope I traumatized Abby.

2477
02:27:42,850 --> 02:27:48,490
What a day.

2478
02:27:49,870 --> 02:27:54,910
I just changed the trajectory of their life.

2479
02:27:56,210 --> 02:27:57,150
I hope...

2480
02:27:57,150 --> 02:28:00,950
I hope Abby will remember this day.

2481
02:28:01,150 --> 02:28:05,250
Maybe she'll quit gambling too because of what I did.

2482
02:28:13,550 --> 02:28:14,910
Alright, guys.

2483
02:28:15,150 --> 02:28:16,950
I'm gonna call it here.

2484
02:28:17,790 --> 02:28:24,270
What a fucking wild, wild rest stream today.

2485
02:28:24,270 --> 02:28:31,050
I'm gonna try a new guerrilla stream when I'm away on my business trip for my concert.

2486
02:28:31,210 --> 02:28:33,490
But thank you everybody for coming.

2487
02:28:34,030 --> 02:28:36,210
I hope you guys had a great time watching.

2488
02:28:36,630 --> 02:28:43,670
I hope some of you guys managed to get your AK skin if you were here for the first two hours.

2489
02:28:47,730 --> 02:28:49,830
Sorry I couldn't stream longer today.

2490
02:28:51,190 --> 02:28:53,150
I had to pack and get ready.

2491
02:28:53,150 --> 02:28:56,050
I had to pack and get ready because I have an early flight.

2492
02:28:56,250 --> 02:28:57,670
So I'm gonna go.

2493
02:28:58,250 --> 02:29:00,190
I'm gonna have to leave now.

2494
02:29:00,270 --> 02:29:01,070
But anyway, guys.

2495
02:29:01,290 --> 02:29:02,950
I hope you guys all enjoyed watching.

2496
02:29:03,090 --> 02:29:05,290
For those who are new here, my name is Doki Bird.

2497
02:29:06,650 --> 02:29:09,270
I'm known for my FPS games.

2498
02:29:09,750 --> 02:29:10,510
FPS streams.

2499
02:29:10,650 --> 02:29:12,790
I used to be Top Islander and Apex and Overwatch.

2500
02:29:13,230 --> 02:29:14,990
Now I'm just a variety streamer.

2501
02:29:16,410 --> 02:29:19,470
I usually stream on YouTube so please check me out there.

2502
02:29:19,470 --> 02:29:23,450
I will announce my Rust Twitch streams on Twitter.

2503
02:29:23,570 --> 02:29:25,390
So please feel free to follow me on Twitter.

2504
02:29:25,510 --> 02:29:28,050
You wanna know when I'm gonna be live streaming Rust.

2505
02:29:29,190 --> 02:29:29,950
What else?

2506
02:29:30,110 --> 02:29:32,670
If you wanna support me via other means, I do have...

2507
02:29:33,190 --> 02:29:35,810
I do have GamerSubcode, Doki Bird.

2508
02:29:36,070 --> 02:29:37,490
Where you can get 10% off.

2509
02:29:37,710 --> 02:29:39,950
I have my merch, my PC case.

2510
02:29:40,430 --> 02:29:43,550
I have a custom PC case and custom keycaps with Hyatt.

2511
02:29:43,750 --> 02:29:45,050
So you can support me with that.

2512
02:29:45,430 --> 02:29:48,870
And then I have voice packs and everything at Doki merch.

2513
02:29:48,870 --> 02:29:50,950
And is that all my shilling?

2514
02:29:52,290 --> 02:29:56,330
Also, I love that you guys can nominate me for the VTuber Awards.

2515
02:29:58,270 --> 02:30:01,970
Nominate me for the VTuber Awards for FPS and Gamer of the Year.

2516
02:30:02,270 --> 02:30:03,710
It would mean a lot.

2517
02:30:04,150 --> 02:30:06,310
Yes, I would love to be nominated again.

2518
02:30:06,790 --> 02:30:08,390
But as me this time.

2519
02:30:08,530 --> 02:30:10,950
So yeah, here's the nomination.

2520
02:30:11,450 --> 02:30:13,450
I don't know if that... I have a command for that.

2521
02:30:13,590 --> 02:30:15,430
So I'm gonna put that here.

2522
02:30:17,410 --> 02:30:20,710
Anyway guys, I hope you guys managed to get your drops.

2523
02:30:21,230 --> 02:30:24,350
And I had a great time streaming today for you guys.

2524
02:30:24,470 --> 02:30:25,750
And I hope you had a great time watching.

2525
02:30:26,270 --> 02:30:28,010
As always everybody, stay high.

2526
02:30:28,230 --> 02:30:30,970
Also, I realized there's a VTuber kingdom too.

2527
02:30:31,390 --> 02:30:33,070
I bet it's so chill there.

2528
02:30:36,570 --> 02:30:39,390
Because I know there's a separate VTuber kingdom.

2529
02:30:39,630 --> 02:30:41,530
And I didn't see them in the war.

2530
02:30:41,910 --> 02:30:45,190
I literally didn't see them in the fucking war.

2531
02:30:45,730 --> 02:30:46,090
So...

2532
02:30:50,150 --> 02:30:50,870
Anyway guys.

2533
02:30:51,190 --> 02:30:52,730
As always everybody, stay hydrated.

2534
02:30:53,070 --> 02:30:53,650
Pause the check.

2535
02:30:53,910 --> 02:30:54,750
Get up and move around.

2536
02:30:54,990 --> 02:30:55,930
Get that blood flowing.

2537
02:30:56,370 --> 02:30:58,030
As always everybody, stay high.

2538
02:30:58,650 --> 02:30:59,310
Oh sorry.

2539
02:30:59,730 --> 02:31:01,190
As always everybody...

2540
02:31:02,550 --> 02:31:03,250
Oh my god.

2541
02:31:03,410 --> 02:31:05,170
I got lost in my fucking outro.

2542
02:31:05,530 --> 02:31:05,690
Wait.

2543
02:31:05,970 --> 02:31:06,390
Stay hydrated.

2544
02:31:06,650 --> 02:31:06,930
Pause the check.

2545
02:31:06,990 --> 02:31:07,410
Get up and move around.

2546
02:31:07,470 --> 02:31:08,130
Get that blood flowing.

2547
02:31:08,210 --> 02:31:09,210
And you stay up for me head to bed.

2548
02:31:09,270 --> 02:31:10,150
Because you deserve it.

2549
02:31:10,210 --> 02:31:11,230
I'll see you guys next time everybody.

2550
02:31:11,590 --> 02:31:12,390
Bye guys.

2551
02:31:12,390 --> 02:31:13,110
Bye.

2552
02:31:14,750 --> 02:31:15,270
God.

2553
02:31:15,350 --> 02:31:16,810
War actually fucked me up guys.

2554
02:32:26,830 --> 02:32:28,630
Literally just ended.

2555
02:32:32,910 --> 02:32:33,430
Sorry.

2556
02:32:34,010 --> 02:32:34,950
Oh my god.

2557
02:32:35,050 --> 02:32:36,530
I have to pack.

2558
02:32:36,790 --> 02:32:37,310
Plow.

2559
02:32:39,890 --> 02:32:40,850
Hey guys.

2560
02:32:41,410 --> 02:32:43,770
I guess I'll raid you to somewhere else.

2561
02:32:43,890 --> 02:32:46,870
I'll raid you to another rush streamer for a drop that you guys might not have got.

2562
02:32:47,190 --> 02:32:47,730
Sorry guys.

2563
02:32:47,830 --> 02:32:48,030
Anyway.

2564
02:32:49,550 --> 02:32:51,350
People who are in Plow's chat.

2565
02:32:51,570 --> 02:32:52,170
Hey.

2566
02:32:53,730 --> 02:32:55,610
I woke up to war.

2567
02:32:55,850 --> 02:32:57,530
And then like I died.

2568
02:32:58,010 --> 02:33:01,890
And I slash killed myself in front of the wheel to a wheel head.

2569
02:33:02,190 --> 02:33:03,870
Because I lost all my scrap.

2570
02:33:04,370 --> 02:33:06,630
That was how my story ended.

2571
02:33:11,070 --> 02:33:11,670
Anyway.

2572
02:33:13,270 --> 02:33:14,310
Hey guys.

2573
02:33:14,430 --> 02:33:16,430
I'm gonna send you guys off to somebody else.

2574
02:33:16,430 --> 02:33:19,190
I didn't realize Plow also ended his stream.

2575
02:33:19,670 --> 02:33:20,450
Hey guys.

2576
02:33:20,550 --> 02:33:21,550
Bye everybody.

2577
02:33:22,450 --> 02:33:22,850
Bye.

2578
02:33:25,030 --> 02:33:26,450
Also subscribe to me on YouTube.

2579
02:33:26,650 --> 02:33:28,030
For those who are like who the fuck is Doki.

2580
02:33:28,330 --> 02:33:29,350
I actually stream on YouTube.

2581
02:33:29,590 --> 02:33:30,810
So subscribe to me there.

2582
02:33:31,210 --> 02:33:33,550
And like I also have my own rest drop by the way.

2583
02:33:33,670 --> 02:33:36,670
So people who are like oh my god do you have anything.

2584
02:33:37,150 --> 02:33:38,450
I also have my own rest drop.

2585
02:33:38,610 --> 02:33:40,950
So like here is the gun you're missing out on.

2586
02:33:40,990 --> 02:33:42,830
Because you can't farm my rest drop right now.

2587
02:33:42,890 --> 02:33:43,430
Because I'm still.

2588
02:33:43,510 --> 02:33:44,610
I'm ending my stream.

2589
02:33:46,090 --> 02:33:48,330
Look at this gun that you can't get right now.

2590
02:33:48,390 --> 02:33:50,170
Because I'm gonna end my stream right now.

2591
02:33:50,670 --> 02:33:51,470
Sorry guys.

2592
02:33:52,130 --> 02:33:52,850
Next time.

2593
02:33:53,030 --> 02:33:54,990
I'll be streaming again next time.

2594
02:33:55,110 --> 02:33:55,850
Whenever I have time.

2595
02:33:56,610 --> 02:33:57,010
Alright.

2596
02:33:57,190 --> 02:33:57,510
Bye.

2597
02:33:57,650 --> 02:33:58,130
For real.
