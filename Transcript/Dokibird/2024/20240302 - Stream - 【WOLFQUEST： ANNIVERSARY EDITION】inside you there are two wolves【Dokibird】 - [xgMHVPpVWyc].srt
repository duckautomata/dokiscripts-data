1
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:16,270
I'm unmuted on Lily's channel!

2
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:21,730
I like how chat has the biggest short-term memory.

3
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:25,570
I'm going to mute myself real quick to talk to Doki.

4
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:27,950
And the second I do that, they're like, Lily!

5
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:29,910
Lily, why can't you be muted?

6
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:30,830
You're muted!

7
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:31,550
You're muted!

8
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:36,390
I'm like, yeah, I just told you I was muted!

9
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:40,870
Wait, don't people say like, chat reflects the streamer?

10
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:43,810
No, that's so wrong.

11
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,590
No, that's not it at all!

12
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:47,130
Oh, that's wrong!

13
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:52,310
Are you trying to say they're dumber than you or they're smarter than you, though?

14
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:55,230
Whichever one gets me in less trouble.

15
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:01,530
Lily's chat, are you smarter or dumber than me?

16
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:04,990
Lily's chat, are you smarter or dumber than me?

17
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:06,010
She was wisely, chat!

18
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:07,410
She was wisely!

19
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:09,950
She was wisely, chat!

20
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:10,290
She was wisely!

21
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:11,810
Wait, so what do I do?

22
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:13,590
I don't know about that one, chief.

23
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:19,210
Don't worry, my chat is a pure reflection of me.

24
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:21,730
Which is like, we're...

25
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:28,750
We're smart, we're great at FPS games, we're so funny.

26
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:30,410
We're smart, we're great at FPS games, we're so funny.

27
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:35,210
We're so kind, we're generous, right, Dragoo?

28
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:37,330
Right, right?

29
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:38,890
Right, guys, right?

30
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:41,510
Yeah, I too am funny.

31
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:44,410
I didn't just spend like almost two hours talking about the game.

32
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:45,190
Oh yeah, I was listening.

33
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:46,450
No, wait, not that.

34
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:50,230
I thought you were talking about your cat!

35
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:52,850
I was listening to you talking about your fucking cat!

36
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:57,590
That's true, I have a cat throwing up, vomiting, all over my furniture, bro.

37
00:05:57,910 --> 00:05:58,170
Bro!

38
00:05:58,170 --> 00:06:06,430
Oh yeah, yeah, like, yeah, you were talking about your cat's allergies and you're like, oh, I'm gonna try and see what your cat's allergic to.

39
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:11,870
But like, yeah, you know like how like, pets can like suddenly develop allergies as they get older?

40
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:13,270
Which is fucked up.

41
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:15,290
It's so annoying!

42
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:16,750
What's it allergic to me?

43
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:20,930
Yeah, I was just like, how do you just suddenly become allergic?

44
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:23,190
Like, what's wrong with you?

45
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:25,290
Like, who purchased this DLC?

46
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:27,270
Stop, retry it, refund it.

47
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:29,830
What the fuck, man?

48
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:32,570
Evolution was not supposed to be like this.

49
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:36,890
I was taught that people evolve after hundreds and thousands of years.

50
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:38,310
Not five years!

51
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:44,190
Evolution isn't supposed to be this fast, stupid.

52
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:44,830
Go back.

53
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:45,150
How dare you!

54
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:47,510
How dare you evolve backwards!

55
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:51,970
Stop evolving backwards.

56
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:55,390
My pet is so fucked up, suddenly he's like allergic.

57
00:06:55,570 --> 00:06:57,250
I'm like, stop, just stop evolving.

58
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:57,430
I'm like, I'm being allergic.

59
00:06:57,730 --> 00:06:58,210
What the fuck?

60
00:06:58,210 --> 00:06:58,950
Yeah, like, what the fuck?

61
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:00,330
Just stop evolving!

62
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:02,170
Stop it!

63
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:05,710
We domesticated you to not be like this!

64
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:09,730
Ryan, all these years of domestication, don't fuck it up.

65
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:12,390
Yeah, your ancestors are disappointed in you.

66
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:17,310
They're looking down at you being like, meow.

67
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:19,990
Wow, this is what I turned into?

68
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:22,210
You used to be a lion.

69
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:26,470
Lions are not allergic to farts.

70
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:27,230
Lions are not allergic to farts.

71
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:28,710
You're a fucking kibble.

72
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:30,850
Like, what's wrong with you?

73
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:33,430
She's like, no, the kibble is too dry.

74
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:34,750
It upsets my tummy.

75
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:36,110
My tummy hurt now.

76
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:37,610
Your tummy hurt.

77
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:37,910
Your tummy hurt.

78
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:38,970
Your kibble got good.

79
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:42,590
We had to fight rhinos.

80
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:49,510
She's like, back in my day, we fought rhinos and now your tummy hurt?

81
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:51,830
What's wrong with you?

82
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:52,370
My tummy hurt.

83
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:55,050
Please, love my tummy.

84
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:55,990
Oh my god.

85
00:07:55,990 --> 00:08:06,050
It's like when our parents go like, they tell stories about, when I used to go to school, I used to go through a snowstorm in a blizzard up a hill for 17 kilometers.

86
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:14,130
When I was your age, I was hunting rhinos.

87
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:14,750
Barefoot.

88
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:18,810
Slides.

89
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:21,650
Carrying my siblings.

90
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:27,870
I had to be an only child because we killed off the other children.

91
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:30,710
I ate the offspring.

92
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:31,990
I ate the offspring.

93
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:35,590
And now you're gonna throw up in Lily's bed?

94
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:40,270
I can't hold my pee-pee.

95
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:41,310
I have to pee.

96
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:44,090
My kibble is too dry.

97
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:46,610
My kibble too dry.

98
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:47,430
Too dry.

99
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:51,530
Please, hydrate the kibble, please.

100
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:54,370
Please, rehydrate the kibble.

101
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:55,830
Please.

102
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:05,250
Yeah, my dog, he evolved into being allergic to chicken after eating chicken kibble.

103
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:06,010
Chicken?

104
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:06,810
Oh my god.

105
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:09,450
He grew up eating chicken kibble.

106
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:13,270
And then out of nowhere, he just started being allergic to chicken.

107
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:15,030
Oh my god.

108
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:16,210
It's like our dogs.

109
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:19,330
I don't know if it was turkey or duck.

110
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:21,410
It wasn't chicken, but it was like a different breed.

111
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:22,210
Turkey or duck.

112
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:22,490
Yeah.

113
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:24,950
We always give them like food left.

114
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:28,030
I was like, oh yeah, here, have a little treat, you know, on the side.

115
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:29,910
And suddenly, it's like...

116
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:33,210
He's acting really strange and I'm like, why?

117
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:36,230
Turns out suddenly he's allergic to duck.

118
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:38,370
Or turkey or whatever the fuck.

119
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:40,090
Oh my god.

120
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:42,510
I had to pay like...

121
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:46,470
Like lots and lots of money at this like specialist.

122
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:48,830
At this like allergy specialist.

123
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:51,230
To do like an allergy test on my dog.

124
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:53,090
And then I got the test back.

125
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:56,390
And he's literally allergic to like maple.

126
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:59,290
Like actual like maple trees and grass.

127
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:01,330
He's like allergic to certain types of grass.

128
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:02,230
And...

129
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:07,790
He's allergic to like...

130
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:09,390
Like certain types of bugs.

131
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:10,590
Like he's like, oh, you...

132
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:13,450
He shouldn't have any mosquito bites.

133
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:15,130
Because he's allergic to mosquitoes.

134
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:18,210
I was like, what the fuck is wrong with you?

135
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:21,630
Imagine being this majestic wolf.

136
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:22,490
And then it's just like...

137
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:24,350
Oh, you know, grass hurty.

138
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:25,330
Grass hurty.

139
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:25,850
Outside.

140
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:27,550
Dangerous.

141
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:29,090
Like I don't wanna be outside.

142
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:30,350
I wanna be on couch.

143
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:32,710
I'm an inside dog now.

144
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:38,290
I want to be inside.

145
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:41,510
Every time I like take him out for a walk.

146
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:43,150
And I have to like wipe his paws.

147
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:44,750
Like get like those like wet wipes.

148
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:46,170
And wipe his paws.

149
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:46,930
When he can't see.

150
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:48,090
Oh, that's not like my paws.

151
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:51,030
It's time to wipe your paws.

152
00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:53,730
Wow, you used to be a wolf.

153
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:58,390
Nice paw wipey time.

154
00:10:58,610 --> 00:10:59,970
Come here little man.

155
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:01,790
Paw wipey, wipey.

156
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:03,170
Alright, before...

157
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:04,410
I just want you guys to know, chat.

158
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:06,830
Before we like started the stream.

159
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:08,050
When we were muted.

160
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:08,850
Lily was...

161
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:12,550
We were talking about the subcategories of furries.

162
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:20,590
It was a very interesting conversation.

163
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:21,230
It was, it was.

164
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:22,550
Oh my gosh, you guys should have seen.

165
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:24,910
Lily knew so much about like furry culture.

166
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:28,270
It was like, what were the subcategories of furries again, Lily?

167
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:29,850
What were they?

168
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:31,470
I don't...

169
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:32,830
Remind me again.

170
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:33,870
I don't remember.

171
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:36,670
I think you had some input on that one if I remember correctly.

172
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:37,690
You were like, okay.

173
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:39,310
So like Lily was like, yeah.

174
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:41,950
There's like three subcategories of furries.

175
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:43,050
And I was like, wow, really?

176
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:44,530
And she's like, yeah.

177
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:46,130
Cause your name is Doki Bird.

178
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:46,670
I was like, yeah.

179
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:47,310
And she's like, yeah.

180
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:48,950
So you're like a feathery.

181
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:49,790
And I was like a feathery?

182
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:51,270
What?

183
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:54,070
This bitch is full of shit.

184
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:03,890
And she was like, yeah, there's like a feathery, a skelly and like a furry.

185
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:06,450
And I learned so much, Lily.

186
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:08,810
I had to educate her real quick.

187
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:10,530
She was so undereducated.

188
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:12,010
I couldn't have that, man.

189
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:13,090
I couldn't have that.

190
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:13,530
Yeah.

191
00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:13,850
Yeah.

192
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:14,090
Yeah.

193
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:16,530
She like educated me so hard.

194
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:16,650
I was like, oh, I'm so sorry.

195
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:18,570
I'm so sorry about the furry culture.

196
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:22,930
I just had to make sure you're aware.

197
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:24,230
I care, you know?

198
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:25,390
Oh, thank you.

199
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:29,610
I'm so happy that you like cared about me so much.

200
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:37,150
I'm like, I don't think she can go on living without knowing any detail, man.

201
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:37,170
Yeah, yeah.

202
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:44,890
Like if we're going to be playing like Wolf Quest, like I had to know the subcategories.

203
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:46,270
Like how I was...

204
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:47,430
Ryan's like, this is a furry?

205
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:50,030
No.

206
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:50,910
Okay, I'm playing...

207
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:52,250
I'm trying to create my wolf right now.

208
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:52,770
I'm so sad.

209
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:53,370
They like...

210
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:56,330
There's like DLC for this game for like better colors.

211
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:57,150
And I'm like...

212
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:57,730
Ryan?

213
00:12:57,970 --> 00:12:59,310
I was like, wow.

214
00:12:59,450 --> 00:12:59,830
That's so nice.

215
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:01,810
I was like, give me the DLC.

216
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,890
I'm like, do I buy it right now?

217
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:06,750
Is that too much commitment?

218
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:07,690
How expensive are they?

219
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:12,010
How expensive are they anyway to be like different colors?

220
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:13,070
Like the DLC ones are so pretty.

221
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:14,310
Bro, they're like seven colors.

222
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:14,790
Like, man, I want to buy them.

223
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:17,830
Seven dollars to have like a different color coat?

224
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:20,290
Or a different color coat.

225
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:21,230
What a bargain.

226
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:22,310
What a bargain though.

227
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:25,570
Like I would...

228
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:28,190
I would pay seven dollars to be a blue wolf.

229
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:28,710
Yeah, sure.

230
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:30,450
You know what?

231
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:31,150
Maybe I will.

232
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:32,910
Maybe I fucking will.

233
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:33,470
Maybe I fucking will.

234
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:34,090
Buy the entire DLC.

235
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:36,310
Maybe I fucking will.

236
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:36,770
Maybe I fucking will.

237
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:37,030
Do it then.

238
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:37,470
Maybe I will.

239
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:38,150
Are you a cow?

240
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:39,350
Are you a little bitch?

241
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:39,990
No, I'm not a cow.

242
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:41,010
I'm buying it right now.

243
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:42,290
I'm buying it.

244
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:43,310
I'm not even kidding.

245
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:44,870
I'm not even kidding.

246
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:47,210
I'm fucking doing so good.

247
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:48,190
Boom!

248
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:49,390
I agreed.

249
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:50,510
That was a bitchin'.

250
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:53,010
Did you buy the full DLC pack?

251
00:13:53,090 --> 00:13:54,550
Or did you chicken out on one?

252
00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:55,930
There's like three.

253
00:13:55,950 --> 00:13:56,350
Oh, hold on.

254
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:56,990
There's three.

255
00:13:57,410 --> 00:14:01,610
I may have chickened out a little bit.

256
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:04,950
I may have not- Buy the rest.

257
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:06,790
Maybe you like the other colors.

258
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:10,490
I mean, clearly you're going to come back to World Quest, right?

259
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:13,090
You're going to- Clearly, I'll buy some more.

260
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:14,350
I'll play some more.

261
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:16,150
It's like... it's like Nikae.

262
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:17,650
But wolves.

263
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:21,250
It's just like Nikae, yes.

264
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:22,510
It's just like Nikae.

265
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:26,230
For those who don't know, in my chat, Lily is a...

266
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:30,090
Like, not ironically, but like, she actually loves Nikae.

267
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:32,250
Dude, that's such a cool game!

268
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:33,050
I love it!

269
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:39,090
It's got beautiful, big booty anime woman.

270
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:42,050
Yeah, and then like, when you shoot the gun...

271
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:43,850
Like, wow, the gun...

272
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:44,190
I love the pudding!

273
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:48,730
I like pudding.

274
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:52,350
How much money have you spent on Nikae?

275
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:53,790
No comment.

276
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:54,630
Come on!

277
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:56,710
Wait, someone in chat rat you out?

278
00:14:57,210 --> 00:15:02,570
I think Nikae is like my least spent gacha so far.

279
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:03,070
Your least?

280
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:05,530
But you stream Nikae so much!

281
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:08,530
Yeah, but it's quite free to play friendly.

282
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:10,510
I get lucky quite a bit.

283
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:11,570
Oh my god!

284
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:18,290
Okay, so like, then you won't be shy to tell me how much you spent on Nikae if it's your least spent one, right?

285
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:20,190
I...

286
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:26,790
Well, you see the skins are like, very pretty.

287
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:32,550
Why are you so scared of telling me if it's your least spent?

288
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:37,390
I mean, it's... a few hundreds, probably.

289
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:38,530
A few hundreds?

290
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:39,750
Like a day, right?

291
00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:42,890
Can you imagine?

292
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:47,810
Every day I wake up, I'm like, I have to swipe my hands, they're shaking.

293
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:48,730
I'm like, I have to swipe my hands.

294
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:52,270
You're like 80% of Nikae's budget.

295
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:56,870
Yeah, it's important!

296
00:15:58,390 --> 00:15:59,370
Oh my god!

297
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:02,370
Like, being a blind wolf is a DLC?

298
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:03,770
That's fucked up!

299
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:05,950
Why is it?

300
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:09,950
Why is like a disability a paid DLC?

301
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:12,710
That's so fucked up!

302
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:14,370
What the fuck?

303
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:16,990
You wanna be a disabled wolf?

304
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:18,430
I have to pay to be blind?

305
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:21,350
What is this like, capitalism shit?

306
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:23,310
Why do I have to pay to be blind?

307
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:26,410
Oh my god!

308
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:29,970
Like, I'm sorry, but blind is only for the cool people, so like, you don't have to, you know?

309
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:33,330
Yeah, yeah, you can only be blind if you have money.

310
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:33,990
I'm sorry.

311
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:36,270
That's just how it goes.

312
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:38,310
That's just how it goes, man.

313
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:39,610
Oh my god.

314
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:40,190
Oh shit!

315
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:41,910
Fuck, everyone can afford being blind!

316
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:44,250
Oh my god, the wolf house!

317
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:47,790
There's so many different wolf houses you can have!

318
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:50,110
Dude, yeah, I have like a billion voices.

319
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:51,190
I'm like, I'm overwhelmed.

320
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:53,150
I have to do the rest of my body first.

321
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:54,190
Oh my god.

322
00:16:54,210 --> 00:16:56,010
It's just so much going on.

323
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:58,890
There's 48 six wolf houses?

324
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:00,490
They all sound the same!

325
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:02,810
I can have a collar!

326
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:04,190
That's so cool!

327
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:04,650
Let's go!

328
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:07,430
Well, the rich gets richer.

329
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:09,370
Oh, I can be large.

330
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:11,350
Yeah, I'll be an orca wolf.

331
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:12,390
I'll be large.

332
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:13,150
Extra large.

333
00:17:13,410 --> 00:17:15,450
You'll be an extra large wolf.

334
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:16,590
Extra large.

335
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:19,110
Alright, I got my howl.

336
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:20,570
I just picked random numbers.

337
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:21,570
There are too many numbers.

338
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:23,970
Oh, I get big ears!

339
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:25,030
Wait, what's this?

340
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:25,790
Ear modifier.

341
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:26,830
What does that do?

342
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:30,990
Big, big ears.

343
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:35,490
I can have like... my ears can be like scratched up.

344
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:38,290
There is tail DLC.

345
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:39,830
There's tail DLC?

346
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:43,230
Having snaggletooth as a DLC?

347
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:44,410
Come on, man!

348
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:48,950
I just bought a DLC and you're telling me snaggletooth weren't part of it?

349
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:50,730
It's time to buy another DLC.

350
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:53,410
It's time to buy another.

351
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:55,850
Damn it.

352
00:17:56,570 --> 00:17:58,830
Don't you want to be cool like all the other wolves?

353
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:03,640
I guess, like me, it's not a DLC though.

354
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,220
Don't you want to be cool?

355
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:06,780
Are you want to be a boring NPC wolf?

356
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:07,320
Or a snaggletooth?

357
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:10,260
Or a main protagonist snaggletooth?

358
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:14,160
I wanna be a main protagonist!

359
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,000
What the fuck?

360
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:19,360
Oh my god, I can have like a collar on.

361
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:22,180
But like educational wise.

362
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,780
Yeah, it's so cool.

363
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,400
An educational collar.

364
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:28,440
An educational collar, guys.

365
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:33,660
It's for educational purposes.

366
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:34,280
Don't worry about it.

367
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:37,520
I can be a fat wolf so you guys know I'm like well fed.

368
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:38,860
Like I can do my job.

369
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:42,540
I wanna be well fed but I want this like little spaghetti tail.

370
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,420
It looks so stupid.

371
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,960
What's a cheek ruff with- Oh, I can be- Oh my god!

372
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:48,960
I'm so fluffy!

373
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:51,820
Yeah, you get to be like a little fluffy boy.

374
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:53,700
Oh my god, what's this?

375
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:54,720
Back curve.

376
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:56,000
Okay, no, it's gonna be straight.

377
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,180
I don't wanna have like back problems.

378
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:00,160
I don't wanna have back problems.

379
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,400
I don't wanna have back problems, wolf.

380
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,700
Alright, ooh.

381
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:05,400
Oh my god, the tail!

382
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:06,700
It's like a cat tail!

383
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,960
Yeah, it's so cute!

384
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:09,740
It's so funny!

385
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,640
There's something wrong with this.

386
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:12,960
With this one.

387
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:17,660
Alright.

388
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:18,860
It's beautiful.

389
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:19,560
Okay.

390
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:22,580
Ooh, a very fluffy- Okay, body shape.

00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:24,360
Oh, I'm big.

392
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:25,060
I'm the alpha.

393
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:27,240
Alright.

394
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,060
I'm the alpha.

395
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,000
I'm the alpha now.

396
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,120
On all levels except physical.

397
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,080
I'm the alpha.

398
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:31,220
I'm the alpha.

399
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:34,020
Oh my god, you can like- Oh, okay.

400
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:36,340
We can- You can like do your stats and stuff.

401
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:39,460
You must take example 1-1.

402
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:40,100
Okay.

403
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:42,340
I don't need to be...

404
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:43,480
Strong.

405
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,720
Wait, no, I should be strong.

406
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,200
I don't need to be healthy.

407
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,480
I can just be strong.

408
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,040
I don't need to be healthy.

409
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,760
I need speed.

410
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:57,260
I need- I need maximum speed.

411
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:57,800
You need speed.

412
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:00,860
Alright, I'm gonna- You know, you can be the speedy one.

413
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,540
I'll have the stamina and the strength.

414
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,500
I'll do a minus 1 on the speed.

415
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:11,860
I have so much speed, but I will just be wheezing after five steps like- My name is Doki Wolf.

416
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:14,560
I- There's a bio by the way.

417
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,680
I- Oh my god.

418
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,320
I was born- The bio.

419
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:20,740
Without a father.

420
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:23,020
Without a father.

421
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,280
My mother left me and abandoned me.

422
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:27,800
At a young age.

423
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,040
My mother- Thank you.

424
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:30,740
Thank you for ghostwriting this for me.

425
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:35,000
My mother abandoned me as a young pup.

426
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:38,360
Casted out by my own family.

427
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:45,020
She now roams the wilds by herself.

428
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:48,740
Let me google the plot of Naruto real quick.

429
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,460
Then I kissed Sasuke.

430
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:01,700
Alright, here we go.

431
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:02,720
Alright.

432
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,200
This is good.

433
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:04,740
This is good.

434
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:07,880
This is a- I figured out a really good plot, guys.

435
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:10,160
Can I put the B-movie script in there?

436
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,060
Yeah, you can!

437
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:13,980
Alright.

438
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:18,080
Alright, in response to the leader of- Okay, let's see.

439
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:22,620
Okay, not Naruto, but Doki Wolf.

440
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:23,720
Doki Wolf.

441
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,920
Unable to make friends.

442
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,280
Unable to make friends?!

443
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:35,940
She is always sad and lonely.

444
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:37,140
Bro!

445
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:40,440
What is this like- You don't like Mary Sue before Wolf?

446
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:44,920
This is like a fucking DeviantArt of- Yeah, yeah!

447
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:47,040
This is like a sparkle-wolf review.

448
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,260
Herself, a male wolf.

449
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,480
I mean, hello?

450
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,420
It's 2024.

451
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,280
Don't judge my male wolf.

452
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:00,280
What the fuck?

453
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:01,220
Whoa!

454
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:02,640
Whoa!

455
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:03,000
Whoa!

456
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:03,580
Don't go there!

457
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:04,460
Whoa!

458
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:07,060
Hey, this is my original OC.

459
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:07,980
Do not steal.

460
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,820
This is my original OC.

461
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:11,100
This is my original OC.

462
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:12,260
Alright.

463
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,020
Oh my god, W, I found you a genius.

464
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:16,960
Just a glimpse- How do I spell glimpse?

465
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:20,760
Into my dark wolf soul.

466
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:21,500
What?

467
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,340
Inside you there are two wolves.

468
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,240
Wait, what did you name your wolf?

469
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:27,200
What did you name it?

470
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:28,260
Wait, what do I name it?

471
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:32,220
My wolf is DokiWolfFPSBTV.

472
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:33,120
Sad Handjob.

473
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:34,720
The sad- What?

474
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,100
Inside you there are two wolves.

475
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:40,980
Sad Handjob and DokiWolf.

476
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:44,340
Wait, wait, wait.

477
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:46,020
I'm picking proper names.

478
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:52,800
I'm not good with proper names.

479
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,360
How do I pick a proper name?

480
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,500
Sads- Oh my god, yes.

481
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:57,180
Sadska.

482
00:22:58,260 --> 00:22:58,940
Sadska.

483
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:00,180
Sadska.

484
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:02,360
Sadska.

485
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:02,720
Sadska.

486
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:03,140
Sadska.

487
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:03,720
Yeah.

488
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:06,520
Okay, maybe I should call DokiWolfToe.

489
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:10,440
How do I spell DokiWolf?

490
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:12,100
DokiWolfToe.

491
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:15,660
Remember the toe, like Naruto, but- Oh!

492
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,400
Sadska and DokiWolfToe.

493
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:25,240
Alright.

494
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:27,700
I'll be like- Alright, no.

495
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:28,240
Okay.

496
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:32,600
DokiWolfToe is social, bold, and energetic.

497
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:35,060
What's IronWolf?

498
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:37,420
Lives on the edge, always one false move.

499
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:39,760
Oh my god, is that like the RuneScape thing?

500
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:42,660
Where they make like- What was it like the- Oh!

501
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:43,420
Yeah!

502
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,160
Probably, yeah.

503
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,140
Yeah, but this time there's a wolf version.

504
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,600
There's a wolf version to this.

505
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:51,800
Oh my god.

506
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,180
Yeah, it's like Iron Man mode!

507
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:53,620
Yeah!

508
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:54,620
But for wolves!

509
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,220
This is crazy.

510
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:56,880
That is crazy.

511
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:57,280
This is so elaborate.

512
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:57,920
Yeah.

513
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,160
Okay, continue.

514
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:04,760
Oh my- She's obviously cautious, a loner, but so much energy.

515
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:05,920
Yes, we have four souls.

516
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:06,780
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

517
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:07,060
Alright.

518
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:12,800
Should we do story mode, which is we have to raise pups, territory quest, or pack life?

519
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,260
I don't know which one's good.

520
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:22,040
The pack would be cool, like what if we just- what if we just do something wrong and then I just get killed?

521
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,940
You just get killed?

522
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:26,120
I'm pretty sure it's the same, right?

523
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:27,080
The story mode?

524
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:30,780
You- It's like establish a territory and raise pups.

525
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:31,520
Okay, wait, chat.

526
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:36,820
All you wolf quest enthusiasts, which is the best one for mission types?

527
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:37,880
Yeah, what's the best one to pick?

528
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:39,080
Yeah, yeah, which one?

529
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,040
Alright, I'll- How do you two breed?

530
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:42,980
We'll figure this out.

531
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:44,240
We'll find other wolves!

532
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:46,940
We'll find other wolves, what the heck?

533
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:52,220
I think Lily's the female wolf, so she can go and find some of the male wolves.

534
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:52,860
Okay.

535
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:55,360
Okay.

536
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:55,640
Yes!

537
00:24:56,900 --> 00:25:04,380
I'll be the dead bee wolf and I'll try to find as many, you know, as many wolves as I can to establish a pack.

538
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,780
We're gonna make a big pack.

539
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,620
We're gonna make a huge pack!

540
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,780
It's fucking massive, bro!

541
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:17,940
Alright, I'll do East- Okay, game name.

542
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:21,600
Um... Wolf, Ruto.

543
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:23,180
That's our game name.

544
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:24,440
Okay, do we want Easy?

545
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,920
Here's an accurate level!

546
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:28,640
Accurate?

547
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:29,460
What is accurate?

548
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:30,460
No, it's fine.

549
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:33,680
We don't- We don't need to have it be accurate.

550
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:35,380
I'm fine with that.

551
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,020
Major decisions, I decide.

552
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:38,860
Okay, set up a game with selected wolf.

553
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:39,160
Alright.

554
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:42,780
I'm setting up our- I'm setting up my wolf.

555
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:45,280
I'm creating my multiplayer and then I'll invite you in.

556
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:45,780
Let's go.

557
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,120
Sashkin is gonna come in.

558
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:52,620
Wolf can smell thousands of times better than humans.

559
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:53,800
Woah!

560
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:55,860
Oh my god, there's me.

561
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,780
A wolf's life is- I'm a fudge right now.

562
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:58,700
One thing.

563
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:03,480
Living long enough to raise the next- Wait, I'm gonna die?!

564
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:06,060
Joki Ruto is gonna die?!

565
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:10,060
Okay, to raise the next generation which will carry their genes in the future.

566
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:15,280
All else from hunting elk to defending a territory drives towards this single goal.

567
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:23,180
Now your pack, which consists of two parents and perhaps several offspring who have stayed with the family pack as adults, can try to realize this goal.

568
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:28,520
The survival of the new literal pups and the survival of your genetic code will be your responsibility.

569
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,280
Oh shit, okay, how do I invite you?

570
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:32,360
My bloodline ends with me.

571
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:34,040
What

572
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:41,550
happened?!

573
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:43,050
I have no family.

574
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:44,470
I am Sashkin.

575
00:26:44,610 --> 00:26:44,790
Woah!

576
00:26:46,290 --> 00:26:46,870
Sashkin!

577
00:26:46,930 --> 00:26:50,990
My family has casted me out that I'm unable to love.

578
00:26:51,290 --> 00:26:54,330
Oh my god, Sashkin, no!

579
00:26:55,690 --> 00:26:59,410
Can you join my game or like do I have to- How do I do that?

580
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:00,330
Oh wait, I have to find you.

581
00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:04,450
Wait, what's your username on- what's your username on WolfQuest?

582
00:27:04,850 --> 00:27:05,510
Oh wait!

583
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:08,770
It should be that.

584
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:11,630
Alright, alright, let me see.

585
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:15,570
Wait, I found player...

586
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:16,730
Oh okay.

587
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:18,430
I sent you a request.

588
00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:21,750
What the fuck's the request?!

589
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:25,190
You have to look at your friends or account, I think?!

590
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:27,310
Remember to save your wolf so you don't lose it.

591
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:27,770
Account?

592
00:27:27,770 --> 00:27:28,930
Yeah, I saved it.

593
00:27:28,930 --> 00:27:30,290
Yeah, I remember to save Sashkin.

594
00:27:30,290 --> 00:27:30,730
My bank and bio.

595
00:27:31,290 --> 00:27:32,190
Yes, accept!

596
00:27:32,570 --> 00:27:32,890
Alright.

597
00:27:33,930 --> 00:27:34,450
Waiting.

598
00:27:34,730 --> 00:27:35,570
I'm waiting for you.

599
00:27:35,850 --> 00:27:37,150
I'm waiting for Sashkin.

600
00:27:37,870 --> 00:27:39,230
I have no friends yet.

601
00:27:40,730 --> 00:27:41,650
No friends.

602
00:27:42,170 --> 00:27:42,690
Friendless.

603
00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:43,730
Friendless?

604
00:27:43,850 --> 00:27:45,330
I have to change my bio.

605
00:27:45,370 --> 00:27:46,170
I have friends now.

606
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:47,750
Maybe I can feel love again.

607
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:50,490
Oh my god, character growth!

608
00:27:51,810 --> 00:27:52,970
Wait, you're not in.

609
00:27:53,050 --> 00:27:53,790
I don't see you.

610
00:27:54,350 --> 00:27:55,810
Yeah, am I friendless now?

611
00:27:55,810 --> 00:27:59,850
Wait, I'm... Wait, wait, can you join via my... Can you join from me?

612
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:03,150
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.

613
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:04,210
Okay, okay, I found you.

614
00:28:04,410 --> 00:28:05,350
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

615
00:28:05,370 --> 00:28:06,470
Create a new pack.

616
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:09,130
I'm friend and... Damn.

617
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:11,670
Alright.

618
00:28:13,130 --> 00:28:14,970
I'm gonna create a new pack right now.

619
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:16,150
Now add players.

620
00:28:16,410 --> 00:28:16,710
Okay.

621
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:18,290
I'm gonna add you.

622
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:21,270
I'm figuring this game out live right now.

623
00:28:21,770 --> 00:28:22,890
We're doing it live!

624
00:28:22,930 --> 00:28:23,610
Yeah, okay, here.

625
00:28:25,130 --> 00:28:26,250
I think we got it.

626
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:27,070
Waiting, waiting.

627
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:27,930
Did you get it?

628
00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:29,690
I added you to my pack.

629
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:32,790
Ah...

630
00:28:33,490 --> 00:28:35,010
It's probably somewhere.

631
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:37,310
It says you're in there.

632
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:37,670
Oh, wait.

633
00:28:37,730 --> 00:28:38,990
Oh, oh, maybe like...

634
00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:40,790
Oh, maybe it just shows up on my screen.

635
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:43,810
Guys, how do I add people to my server?

636
00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:46,510
How do we play together?

637
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:48,910
How do we play together, guys?

638
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:51,010
This is the most important part.

639
00:28:51,130 --> 00:28:51,470
Oh, okay.

640
00:28:53,610 --> 00:28:54,410
What the heck?

641
00:28:54,530 --> 00:28:56,510
All you WolfQuest enthusiasts.

642
00:28:57,370 --> 00:28:58,330
How do you...

643
00:28:58,330 --> 00:28:59,350
Someone has to know.

644
00:28:59,450 --> 00:29:04,710
Someone must have know... must have played this game for at least 50 hours.

645
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:06,550
I know you exist.

646
00:29:08,290 --> 00:29:09,510
I know.

647
00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:11,750
Come on.

648
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:13,270
You have to connect.

649
00:29:13,270 --> 00:29:14,410
You're in there somewhere.

650
00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:16,950
I know you're here somewhere.

651
00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:19,590
No idea.

652
00:29:19,770 --> 00:29:20,230
Damn.

653
00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:24,290
How do I play together?

654
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:25,670
How do I play together?

655
00:29:26,130 --> 00:29:27,990
This is the most important part.

656
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:30,990
Imagine we fail here.

657
00:29:31,130 --> 00:29:33,370
Like, this is the first difficulty hurdle.

658
00:29:33,450 --> 00:29:34,890
We just fail at playing together.

659
00:29:34,890 --> 00:29:38,410
We just don't even know how to join the server.

660
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:42,030
I can't do this.

661
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:42,770
Like, anyway.

662
00:29:44,310 --> 00:29:44,830
Elk.

663
00:29:45,770 --> 00:29:47,770
I literally made... Okay, wait.

664
00:29:47,790 --> 00:29:49,150
I'm gonna return to main menu.

665
00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:51,050
I'm gonna end my session.

666
00:29:51,570 --> 00:29:54,910
And then I'll... I can create a new world so easily.

667
00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:55,790
I have all the power.

668
00:29:56,270 --> 00:29:56,670
Alright.

669
00:29:57,390 --> 00:29:58,790
It never even... Oh!

670
00:29:58,910 --> 00:29:59,310
Now!

671
00:29:59,490 --> 00:30:00,750
I need to... to the pack.

672
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:02,030
Lily the furry.

673
00:30:03,090 --> 00:30:03,490
Yes!

674
00:30:04,050 --> 00:30:04,450
Yes!

675
00:30:04,490 --> 00:30:06,950
I would love to join Lily the furry pack.

676
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:07,330
Nice.

677
00:30:07,410 --> 00:30:08,290
Oh, you go to join!

678
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:08,890
Okay, okay.

679
00:30:09,010 --> 00:30:09,750
I figured it out.

680
00:30:09,930 --> 00:30:11,010
I figured it out.

681
00:30:11,530 --> 00:30:11,930
Okay.

682
00:30:12,050 --> 00:30:12,770
I'm in it now.

683
00:30:12,830 --> 00:30:14,090
I think it just takes a long time.

684
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:15,670
No, I just... I deleted the world.

685
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:16,490
So you're not in it.

686
00:30:16,490 --> 00:30:17,770
You're not in it.

687
00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:19,250
I deleted the world.

688
00:30:21,870 --> 00:30:22,710
I'm not in it.

689
00:30:22,730 --> 00:30:23,090
Never mind.

690
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:24,010
Okay, okay, okay.

691
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:25,190
Do not worry.

692
00:30:25,430 --> 00:30:26,510
I'm fixing this.

693
00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:27,470
I put this on easy.

694
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:27,930
Okay.

695
00:30:28,050 --> 00:30:30,090
I set up my game with selected wolf.

696
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:32,710
Okay, let me see.

697
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:33,410
What do I... Okay.

698
00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:35,510
Doki, Ruto.

699
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:36,870
Alright, that's the world.

700
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:40,950
Okay, you go to join multiplayer game.

701
00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:42,550
You click new game.

702
00:30:42,910 --> 00:30:43,590
New game?

703
00:30:43,630 --> 00:30:45,130
Join multiplayer game.

704
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:48,030
And then you should see Doki, Ruto.

705
00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:49,430
I think.

706
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:51,230
Start game selected... Nope.

707
00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:54,570
So you see the single player?

708
00:30:54,790 --> 00:30:57,770
You change to join multiplayer world.

709
00:30:58,150 --> 00:30:59,510
Yeah, I clicked something wrong.

710
00:30:59,710 --> 00:30:59,990
Help!

711
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:00,390
Oh, oh.

712
00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:01,470
Okay, okay.

713
00:31:01,670 --> 00:31:02,190
Okay!

714
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:05,110
Stop!

715
00:31:05,610 --> 00:31:06,130
No!

716
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:07,410
Let me go!

717
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:08,510
Let me go!

718
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:09,430
Where are you, Lily?

719
00:31:10,050 --> 00:31:11,030
Where are you?

720
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:14,310
Freaking... back to main menu.

721
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:14,750
Boom!

722
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:14,950
Okay.

723
00:31:15,130 --> 00:31:15,550
Okay.

724
00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:17,270
New game.

725
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:22,470
You guys can look at my cool wolf while we give Lily a step by step.

726
00:31:22,930 --> 00:31:23,690
No, no, no.

727
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:23,930
Us.

728
00:31:23,930 --> 00:31:24,210
Yeah, yeah.

729
00:31:24,270 --> 00:31:25,130
Join multiplayer.

730
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:28,150
Oh, we have rules!

731
00:31:28,390 --> 00:31:29,550
No profanity, Doki.

732
00:31:29,630 --> 00:31:30,390
Thank you very much.

733
00:31:30,410 --> 00:31:30,770
Thank you.

734
00:31:30,790 --> 00:31:31,450
No problem.

735
00:31:35,150 --> 00:31:36,010
Please behave.

736
00:31:36,150 --> 00:31:36,630
Please behave.

737
00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:37,010
Yeah, yeah.

738
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:39,850
Remember this is a PG stream, by the way.

739
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:42,410
No profanity in my wolf world.

740
00:31:43,490 --> 00:31:48,150
We don't want the admins to come in here and ban us from wolf quest, guys.

741
00:31:48,370 --> 00:31:48,850
Exactly.

742
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:49,450
Yeah.

743
00:31:50,390 --> 00:31:53,290
I would be so devastated if my wolf got banned.

744
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:57,470
Oh my, my hours and money.

745
00:31:57,590 --> 00:32:00,650
She spent DLC money, guys.

746
00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:01,330
I bought DLC.

747
00:32:01,490 --> 00:32:02,630
You can't ban me.

748
00:32:02,690 --> 00:32:04,850
Someone's like, this is a Christian pack.

749
00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:11,610
My dad works for Nintendo and he will find you.

750
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:14,790
He'll turn off your Switch forever.

751
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:17,430
Where is Sasuke?

752
00:32:18,050 --> 00:32:19,910
What server do I join?

753
00:32:20,150 --> 00:32:21,030
Doki Ruto.

754
00:32:21,610 --> 00:32:21,690
US East?

755
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:22,590
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

756
00:32:23,130 --> 00:32:23,750
Okay.

757
00:32:23,930 --> 00:32:25,170
It's the US East one.

758
00:32:25,730 --> 00:32:26,990
Oh, Doki Ruto.

759
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:27,570
Yeah, yeah.

760
00:32:27,690 --> 00:32:29,890
There's only one Doki Ruto world.

761
00:32:31,790 --> 00:32:32,410
Oh.

762
00:32:33,430 --> 00:32:34,050
Oh.

763
00:32:34,670 --> 00:32:34,810
Oh.

764
00:32:36,430 --> 00:32:37,050
Oh.

765
00:32:38,330 --> 00:32:38,950
Shit.

766
00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:41,050
Oh, I got Sasuke.

767
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:41,710
Oh, Sasuke!

768
00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:43,190
Oh, Sasuke!

769
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:44,090
Ah, Sasuke!

770
00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:45,130
What is it?

771
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:45,910
I'm still loading.

772
00:32:46,010 --> 00:32:46,430
What the heck?

773
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:46,870
What the heck is this?

774
00:32:46,870 --> 00:32:47,150
You're here too!

775
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:49,830
Oh my god.

776
00:32:49,870 --> 00:32:50,910
Do you have a collar on?

777
00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:52,490
You're domestic.

778
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:55,030
I cannot be domesticated.

779
00:32:55,030 --> 00:32:56,090
You look like a fucking dog.

780
00:32:56,090 --> 00:32:57,430
You look like a collar on my father and brethren.

781
00:32:57,910 --> 00:33:00,390
I've been carrying this around for years.

782
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:02,870
All right, Maserile.

783
00:33:02,890 --> 00:33:03,390
You can see...

784
00:33:03,390 --> 00:33:05,230
Oh my god, you look like a fucking dog.

785
00:33:06,510 --> 00:33:07,910
What's wrong with your ears?

786
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:08,150
What's wrong with your fucking tail?

787
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:09,170
My fucking tail's like a rat tail.

788
00:33:09,770 --> 00:33:12,010
What's wrong with your fucking ears?

789
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:12,390
Ow!

790
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:14,890
Okay, I need to look at the account.

791
00:33:15,050 --> 00:33:16,570
I need to look at the...

792
00:33:19,490 --> 00:33:22,770
Oh my god, what's wrong with you?

793
00:33:22,810 --> 00:33:24,270
My ears are just a little crooked, man.

794
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:24,990
What the heck?

795
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:26,030
You're shaming me?

796
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:30,590
Yeah, I'm ear-shaming you, and tail-shaming you, and collar-shaming you.

797
00:33:33,730 --> 00:33:35,150
I'm gonna look at the controls.

798
00:33:35,410 --> 00:33:36,710
Okay, let's see.

799
00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:36,970
Okay.

800
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:38,430
Oh, I can sit down?

801
00:33:38,570 --> 00:33:39,710
There's emotes?

802
00:33:39,770 --> 00:33:40,790
There's a head cam?

803
00:33:41,630 --> 00:33:42,230
Wait.

804
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:44,330
Well, establish your territory.

805
00:33:44,490 --> 00:33:45,250
Can I pee on you?

806
00:33:45,910 --> 00:33:46,810
Excuse me?

807
00:33:48,430 --> 00:33:49,810
Wait, it's on pee.

808
00:33:49,810 --> 00:33:51,130
I just slipped a leg real quick.

809
00:33:51,170 --> 00:33:51,630
Wait, wait.

810
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:56,310
Wait, is that...?

811
00:34:02,090 --> 00:34:02,690
What?

812
00:34:04,970 --> 00:34:07,010
I'm establishing my territory.

813
00:34:07,570 --> 00:34:08,990
I'm just establishing.

814
00:34:09,410 --> 00:34:10,170
Don't mind me.

815
00:34:10,170 --> 00:34:11,590
Yeah, don't mind me.

816
00:34:11,610 --> 00:34:12,970
I know what's my territory.

817
00:34:14,850 --> 00:34:15,310
Excuse me?

818
00:34:15,310 --> 00:34:16,790
I am bigger than you.

819
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:18,350
Sasuke.

820
00:34:19,210 --> 00:34:19,810
Sasuke.

821
00:34:20,910 --> 00:34:23,130
You cannot win in this fight.

822
00:34:23,370 --> 00:34:25,070
Wait, I can... I can sleep?

823
00:34:25,370 --> 00:34:26,490
Oh my god, I'm sleeping.

824
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:27,330
Oh my god.

825
00:34:27,830 --> 00:34:28,730
I'm sleeping.

826
00:34:28,970 --> 00:34:30,450
Okay, what's the emotes?

827
00:34:30,890 --> 00:34:35,050
Wait, there's like... play... wait.

828
00:34:35,170 --> 00:34:37,130
Oh, press... hold E and you can emote.

829
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:38,750
I can roll.

830
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:39,730
Yay.

831
00:34:41,210 --> 00:34:43,470
My tail wag is so gross.

832
00:34:44,850 --> 00:34:46,930
I have like a fucking rat tail.

833
00:34:49,410 --> 00:34:49,810
Submissive.

834
00:34:51,330 --> 00:34:53,010
What is... what is submissive?

835
00:34:53,010 --> 00:34:54,210
Okay, what's airplane ears?

836
00:34:54,390 --> 00:34:55,430
Oh my god, I'm just like you now.

837
00:34:56,150 --> 00:34:56,550
You're like me.

838
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:57,310
I can be just like you.

839
00:34:57,530 --> 00:34:59,230
You know that says... oh, uncertain.

840
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:00,710
Oh, avert gaze.

841
00:35:01,590 --> 00:35:04,050
What about... wait, what is the body?

842
00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:05,690
There's like sniff nose.

843
00:35:05,790 --> 00:35:06,550
Confident tail.

844
00:35:06,790 --> 00:35:07,950
I can sniff you.

845
00:35:08,830 --> 00:35:09,230
Sniffer.

846
00:35:09,950 --> 00:35:10,710
Okay, wait.

847
00:35:10,790 --> 00:35:11,710
I can lick face.

848
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:13,250
Wait, why can't I lick you?

849
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:14,250
I can't...

850
00:35:17,530 --> 00:35:18,710
Oh my god.

851
00:35:18,870 --> 00:35:19,690
Okay, wait, let's see.

852
00:35:19,830 --> 00:35:20,870
I can smile.

853
00:35:20,990 --> 00:35:21,670
I can sniff your butt.

854
00:35:22,390 --> 00:35:23,630
Wait, are you sniffing my butt?

855
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:24,850
Wait, wait.

856
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:26,110
Wait, are you actually...

857
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:27,730
How do I... how do I...

858
00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:28,790
I think it's body.

859
00:35:30,110 --> 00:35:30,590
Body.

860
00:35:30,830 --> 00:35:31,490
And then I like...

861
00:35:31,490 --> 00:35:32,170
No, there's sniff noses.

862
00:35:32,170 --> 00:35:33,150
There's no sniff butt.

863
00:35:34,210 --> 00:35:34,890
Sniff nose.

864
00:35:34,970 --> 00:35:35,930
Yeah, why is sniff butt?

865
00:35:36,570 --> 00:35:38,230
This game is not accurate.

866
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:39,770
Maybe it's a DLC.

867
00:35:41,930 --> 00:35:43,070
But sniffing DLC.

868
00:35:43,070 --> 00:35:43,230
But sniffing DLC.

869
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:44,650
Sniffing DLC.

870
00:35:47,990 --> 00:35:50,850
Alright, what is our... what even is our purpose?

871
00:35:51,010 --> 00:35:56,050
We were supposed to establish territory and like raise our... raise pups.

872
00:35:56,350 --> 00:35:57,950
Our purpose is revenge.

873
00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:00,670
Revenge.

874
00:36:00,670 --> 00:36:01,810
We need to find our Sakura.

875
00:36:01,810 --> 00:36:02,990
Sakura also failed us.

876
00:36:04,970 --> 00:36:07,250
Sasuke, we need to find our Sakura.

877
00:36:08,530 --> 00:36:10,850
We need to find our Sakura.

878
00:36:10,850 --> 00:36:12,310
She cheated on me with Naruto.

879
00:36:13,050 --> 00:36:14,170
Well, well, wait.

880
00:36:14,370 --> 00:36:15,430
That's, it's not cheating.

881
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:17,170
Look, you got...

882
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:20,550
It's not cheating.

883
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:22,590
Sasuke, we told you this.

884
00:36:22,650 --> 00:36:24,230
This is an open relationship.

885
00:36:26,570 --> 00:36:27,930
I never agree.

886
00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:32,550
Alright, let's see.

887
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:33,210
Where do we go?

888
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:35,030
How do I...

889
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:36,190
Where do we go?

890
00:36:36,470 --> 00:36:37,770
Wait, no I'm the leader.

891
00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:38,770
Okay, follow me.

892
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:40,630
Follow me.

893
00:36:41,090 --> 00:36:43,410
It's not cheating if there are two wolves inside.

894
00:36:43,530 --> 00:36:44,610
Oh my god, your price!

895
00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:48,650
It's not cheating if there are two wolves inside of her!

896
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:52,330
Inside of me there is two wolves.

897
00:36:53,270 --> 00:36:54,350
Yo, what's this?

898
00:36:54,810 --> 00:36:55,450
Wait, quest.

899
00:36:55,510 --> 00:36:56,870
We need to find a den.

900
00:36:57,770 --> 00:36:59,430
We need to find a den.

901
00:37:00,350 --> 00:37:01,290
A den?

902
00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:01,970
Yeah.

903
00:37:02,310 --> 00:37:06,230
We need to find a place to establish our territory.

904
00:37:06,690 --> 00:37:07,570
Wait, where are you?

905
00:37:07,650 --> 00:37:08,230
Where did you go?

906
00:37:08,850 --> 00:37:10,250
I think I'm hunting something.

907
00:37:10,490 --> 00:37:11,270
I'm not sure how.

908
00:37:11,470 --> 00:37:12,610
Oh my god, you're hunting.

909
00:37:12,790 --> 00:37:13,310
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

910
00:37:13,370 --> 00:37:13,650
Don't worry.

911
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:16,030
Alright.

912
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:18,150
When... hold to press... Oh, I can bite him!

913
00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:20,690
How do I bite him?

914
00:37:21,050 --> 00:37:21,630
Oh, okay.

915
00:37:21,770 --> 00:37:23,330
She just lets me bite him.

916
00:37:23,450 --> 00:37:24,610
Alright, you just press spacebar.

917
00:37:25,990 --> 00:37:26,750
Oh, spacebar!

918
00:37:26,790 --> 00:37:27,270
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

919
00:37:27,450 --> 00:37:28,290
Spacebar, spacebar.

920
00:37:28,730 --> 00:37:29,210
Don't worry.

921
00:37:30,070 --> 00:37:30,930
I'm hunting too.

922
00:37:31,070 --> 00:37:31,670
I'm injured?

923
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:34,310
What are you hunting?

924
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:35,050
I'm...

925
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:37,430
I'm hunting a fucking cat!

926
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:40,590
I'm hunting like a little fox.

927
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:41,810
A little fox?

928
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:43,850
There's like a... Dude, this cat's bigger than me.

929
00:37:44,710 --> 00:37:46,870
Nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom.

930
00:37:47,490 --> 00:37:48,350
Nom nom nom.

931
00:37:49,210 --> 00:37:51,310
Oh my god, how much HP do you have?

932
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:53,910
I'm just biting his butt relentlessly.

933
00:37:54,090 --> 00:37:54,890
Oh, I think I'm dead.

934
00:37:56,010 --> 00:37:56,630
Wait, what?

935
00:37:56,870 --> 00:37:57,210
No way!

936
00:37:57,210 --> 00:37:57,450
Oh, wait, wait.

937
00:37:57,530 --> 00:37:58,030
No, no, no.

938
00:37:58,050 --> 00:37:58,330
I'm okay.

939
00:37:58,410 --> 00:37:58,770
I'm okay.

940
00:37:58,930 --> 00:37:59,310
I'm okay.

941
00:38:00,370 --> 00:38:02,570
I was like, what the heck are you messing with?

942
00:38:03,810 --> 00:38:05,090
Okay, I'm... You know what?

943
00:38:05,090 --> 00:38:06,530
This gets cougar wins.

944
00:38:06,690 --> 00:38:08,570
This cougar is way too strong.

945
00:38:09,890 --> 00:38:11,010
Whoa, win.

946
00:38:11,830 --> 00:38:13,150
Definitely not me.

947
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:15,870
Oh my god, you're so far.

948
00:38:16,370 --> 00:38:16,390
Create a stand spot.

949
00:38:17,410 --> 00:38:19,510
Make markings into stand spot.

950
00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:21,630
Mark it again to boost your claim.

951
00:38:21,670 --> 00:38:22,810
Wait, how do I mark something?

952
00:38:23,330 --> 00:38:23,590
Pee.

953
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:26,610
Oh, how convenient.

954
00:38:26,990 --> 00:38:28,210
I cannot pee on my food?

955
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:29,010
Wait, wait.

956
00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:31,330
Why are you peeing on your food?

957
00:38:32,190 --> 00:38:33,810
I have to mark it as mine.

958
00:38:34,090 --> 00:38:34,770
It's... Yep.

959
00:38:35,090 --> 00:38:35,470
That's mine now.

960
00:38:35,470 --> 00:38:36,470
That's mine now, too.

961
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:37,550
Wait, I'm gonna mark this tree.

962
00:38:37,930 --> 00:38:39,030
You can't do that.

963
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:40,290
I'll reclaim it.

964
00:38:40,370 --> 00:38:41,130
No, no, no, no.

965
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:41,930
Too soon.

966
00:38:41,970 --> 00:38:45,970
Return to reinforce the sent post and boost your claim.

967
00:38:46,310 --> 00:38:47,430
Oh, I can express myself.

968
00:38:48,310 --> 00:38:49,370
I can express myself.

969
00:38:54,030 --> 00:38:54,890
Pag rally.

970
00:38:55,830 --> 00:38:58,990
We're our wolf brethrens.

971
00:39:03,790 --> 00:39:04,570
Rally achieved.

972
00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:05,910
Nice.

973
00:39:06,050 --> 00:39:06,710
Look at us.

974
00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:07,390
We're rallied.

975
00:39:07,430 --> 00:39:08,530
We're like... How do I eat this?

976
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:09,530
How do we eat this?

977
00:39:09,650 --> 00:39:10,590
We wanna eat this fox.

978
00:39:11,690 --> 00:39:13,810
I spent all this time killing you.

979
00:39:13,810 --> 00:39:14,050
I know.

980
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:15,130
How do I eat it?

981
00:39:15,130 --> 00:39:16,450
This is important.

982
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:17,310
We're starving.

983
00:39:17,670 --> 00:39:18,630
We're starving.

984
00:39:21,050 --> 00:39:21,510
Help?

985
00:39:21,810 --> 00:39:22,270
Help?

986
00:39:22,270 --> 00:39:22,710
Help, guys.

987
00:39:22,850 --> 00:39:23,690
We need a dough.

988
00:39:23,970 --> 00:39:24,970
How do we eat this wolf?

989
00:39:24,970 --> 00:39:25,470
I'm hungry.

990
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:26,890
We're starving.

991
00:39:28,590 --> 00:39:30,150
Can we just leave it to die?

992
00:39:31,210 --> 00:39:31,990
What the...

993
00:39:31,990 --> 00:39:33,030
What are you doing?

994
00:39:33,270 --> 00:39:33,490
Eat it.

995
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:35,330
Eat it.

996
00:39:37,130 --> 00:39:38,010
I don't know.

997
00:39:38,170 --> 00:39:38,510
I don't know.

998
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:39,810
We can't eat canines.

999
00:39:39,950 --> 00:39:40,490
We can't.

1000
00:39:40,530 --> 00:39:42,190
So we killed him for no reason?

1001
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:43,910
Why can't I eat canines?

1002
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:45,250
Of course I can.

1003
00:39:45,330 --> 00:39:45,930
I'm a wolf.

1004
00:39:46,190 --> 00:39:47,310
Of course I can eat canines.

1005
00:39:47,650 --> 00:39:47,650
Meat is meat.

1006
00:39:47,650 --> 00:39:48,250
I know.

1007
00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:49,450
Who cares?

1008
00:39:49,510 --> 00:39:50,110
What the...

1009
00:39:50,810 --> 00:39:52,490
Who cares what I'm eating?

1010
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:53,090
I know.

1011
00:39:53,330 --> 00:39:53,970
We're leaving.

1012
00:39:54,290 --> 00:39:57,210
Clearly, you're not scared of a hunter as you say you are.

1013
00:39:57,930 --> 00:39:58,790
My bad.

1014
00:39:58,890 --> 00:39:59,570
My, my B.

1015
00:39:59,710 --> 00:40:02,030
I guess I'll kill like an elk or something.

1016
00:40:02,130 --> 00:40:02,570
Who knows?

1017
00:40:02,710 --> 00:40:03,670
What's that over there?

1018
00:40:03,750 --> 00:40:04,370
Is that an elk?

1019
00:40:04,770 --> 00:40:05,690
Wait, there's an elk.

1020
00:40:06,210 --> 00:40:07,070
Oh, oh, oh.

1021
00:40:07,610 --> 00:40:10,370
You're entering the territory of a stranger wolf territory.

1022
00:40:11,430 --> 00:40:12,670
If I mark it, it's mine.

1023
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:15,130
Yeah, if I mark it, it's not the stranger's anymore.

1024
00:40:15,410 --> 00:40:15,770
Yeah, boom.

1025
00:40:15,870 --> 00:40:16,430
It's mine now.

1026
00:40:16,470 --> 00:40:16,950
Yeah, it's ours.

1027
00:40:17,070 --> 00:40:17,530
It's looking...

1028
00:40:20,330 --> 00:40:21,230
Sorry, not sorry.

1029
00:40:21,450 --> 00:40:21,790
It's mine now.

1030
00:40:21,790 --> 00:40:23,070
Yeah, it's our territory now.

1031
00:40:25,350 --> 00:40:26,470
Mule deer nearby.

1032
00:40:26,730 --> 00:40:27,810
Mule deer damage?

1033
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:29,130
Wait, where the fuck is the deer?

1034
00:40:30,250 --> 00:40:32,290
I feel like we need a home, Lily.

1035
00:40:33,170 --> 00:40:35,230
Yeah, I feel like we have to find a home.

1036
00:40:35,230 --> 00:40:36,250
We need a home.

1037
00:40:36,370 --> 00:40:37,990
I don't like this.

1038
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:42,190
I don't like that we're just loner wolves trying to fucking steal food.

1039
00:40:43,530 --> 00:40:45,770
Where the fuck... How do we establish a home?

1040
00:40:45,770 --> 00:40:46,670
Take over a territory.

1041
00:40:46,830 --> 00:40:49,130
Find scent spots in this hex.

1042
00:40:49,470 --> 00:40:51,330
Mark it to reduce the claim.

1043
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:52,690
Then establish a home.

1044
00:40:52,690 --> 00:40:55,770
This game is much more elaborate than I expected it to be.

1045
00:40:55,930 --> 00:40:56,230
Right?

1046
00:40:56,310 --> 00:40:57,930
I thought this was gonna be easy.

1047
00:40:58,010 --> 00:40:59,730
I have to actually use my brain here.

1048
00:40:59,810 --> 00:41:00,250
What the heck?

1049
00:41:00,330 --> 00:41:02,290
Are you still peeing on trees?

1050
00:41:02,570 --> 00:41:02,730
Wait.

1051
00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:05,770
Yeah, I'm trying to find... I'm trying to find the scent spots.

1052
00:41:05,990 --> 00:41:06,670
How do I find...

1053
00:41:06,670 --> 00:41:07,490
I found food.

1054
00:41:07,850 --> 00:41:08,630
You found food?

1055
00:41:08,870 --> 00:41:09,610
Nom nom nom nom.

1056
00:41:10,270 --> 00:41:11,030
Oh my god.

1057
00:41:11,130 --> 00:41:12,110
Oh my god, he's strong.

1058
00:41:12,110 --> 00:41:12,170
He's strong.

1059
00:41:12,170 --> 00:41:12,210
He's strong.

1060
00:41:12,270 --> 00:41:12,370
He's strong.

1061
00:41:12,370 --> 00:41:12,730
Oh my god, he's in giant moves.

1062
00:41:12,810 --> 00:41:13,090
Don't worry.

1063
00:41:13,130 --> 00:41:14,230
We can kill him together.

1064
00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:15,430
Kill him together.

1065
00:41:15,770 --> 00:41:16,590
Can I... can I...

1066
00:41:16,590 --> 00:41:17,630
Go, go, go, go.

1067
00:41:17,890 --> 00:41:19,010
Nom nom nom nom nom.

1068
00:41:19,190 --> 00:41:19,990
Yeah, that's right.

1069
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:20,590
There's two of us.

1070
00:41:20,590 --> 00:41:21,070
We're gonna go.

1071
00:41:21,450 --> 00:41:21,810
Yes.

1072
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:22,550
Yes.

1073
00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:23,050
That's fucking right.

1074
00:41:23,050 --> 00:41:23,510
Nom nom nom.

1075
00:41:23,870 --> 00:41:24,690
Nom nom nom.

1076
00:41:25,610 --> 00:41:27,170
He's... he's single now.

1077
00:41:27,230 --> 00:41:27,670
That's good.

1078
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:27,950
Let's go.

1079
00:41:27,950 --> 00:41:28,310
That's good.

1080
00:41:28,310 --> 00:41:28,610
That's good.

1081
00:41:28,610 --> 00:41:28,890
That's good.

1082
00:41:28,910 --> 00:41:29,570
I might be dying.

1083
00:41:29,610 --> 00:41:30,790
I think I'm dying, Lily.

1084
00:41:30,790 --> 00:41:32,250
I think I'm dying, Lily.

1085
00:41:32,250 --> 00:41:32,850
Don't die!

1086
00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:37,010
We will kill this moose before I die.

1087
00:41:37,150 --> 00:41:38,530
I have a major injury.

1088
00:41:38,610 --> 00:41:39,990
I fractured my leg.

1089
00:41:40,290 --> 00:41:41,250
I'm fractured.

1090
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:43,070
Just don't be weak.

1091
00:41:43,130 --> 00:41:44,050
Don't have a fractured leg.

1092
00:41:44,070 --> 00:41:44,890
Just don't be weak.

1093
00:41:44,890 --> 00:41:46,110
Do you not have a fractured leg?

1094
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:47,590
I have a fractured leg.

1095
00:41:49,170 --> 00:41:50,270
I'm almost like, let's go.

1096
00:41:50,410 --> 00:41:50,870
It's okay.

1097
00:41:50,870 --> 00:41:51,410
It's half HP.

1098
00:41:51,410 --> 00:41:51,790
Nom nom nom nom.

1099
00:41:52,170 --> 00:41:53,190
It's half HP.

1100
00:41:53,930 --> 00:41:54,990
Where are you?

1101
00:41:55,310 --> 00:41:56,150
I'm gonna die.

1102
00:41:56,250 --> 00:41:56,970
I'm gonna die.

1103
00:41:56,970 --> 00:41:57,490
I'm limping.

1104
00:41:57,550 --> 00:41:58,510
I'm literally limping.

1105
00:41:58,710 --> 00:42:00,250
I'm literally limping.

1106
00:42:01,330 --> 00:42:02,150
Nom nom nom nom.

1107
00:42:02,250 --> 00:42:02,590
I'll watch.

1108
00:42:02,630 --> 00:42:02,970
That's right.

1109
00:42:03,050 --> 00:42:03,370
That's right.

1110
00:42:03,690 --> 00:42:04,270
I'll watch.

1111
00:42:04,450 --> 00:42:04,830
Don't worry.

1112
00:42:04,910 --> 00:42:05,770
You got this, Zetsuki.

1113
00:42:06,150 --> 00:42:06,590
Critical damage.

1114
00:42:06,590 --> 00:42:06,590
Critical damage.

1115
00:42:06,590 --> 00:42:07,110
You got this.

1116
00:42:08,710 --> 00:42:09,390
Don't worry.

1117
00:42:10,190 --> 00:42:11,390
I'll howl for you.

1118
00:42:12,850 --> 00:42:13,290
Howl.

1119
00:42:13,290 --> 00:42:13,690
Howl.

1120
00:42:14,410 --> 00:42:15,830
Nom nom nom nom.

1121
00:42:17,250 --> 00:42:17,690
Die.

1122
00:42:18,890 --> 00:42:19,850
Nom nom nom nom.

1123
00:42:19,850 --> 00:42:20,290
I'm gonna watch.

1124
00:42:20,350 --> 00:42:20,970
Oh my god.

1125
00:42:21,030 --> 00:42:22,130
He hit me in the head.

1126
00:42:22,750 --> 00:42:24,410
Do not touch my moose.

1127
00:42:24,430 --> 00:42:25,230
Oh my god.

1128
00:42:25,290 --> 00:42:25,670
Don't worry.

1129
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:26,590
I'll sit here and watch.

1130
00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:27,670
I believe in you.

1131
00:42:27,770 --> 00:42:29,030
This is my own home theater.

1132
00:42:29,490 --> 00:42:30,710
This is my...

1133
00:42:31,770 --> 00:42:32,230
I have to go.

1134
00:42:32,230 --> 00:42:32,730
I have no stamina.

1135
00:42:32,970 --> 00:42:33,830
Oh my god.

1136
00:42:33,930 --> 00:42:34,490
Nom nom nom nom.

1137
00:42:34,650 --> 00:42:35,650
I need to find something.

1138
00:42:35,770 --> 00:42:36,130
Zetsuki.

1139
00:42:36,390 --> 00:42:37,370
I need to eat.

1140
00:42:37,490 --> 00:42:38,290
Nom nom nom nom.

1141
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:39,330
Come.

1142
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:39,650
Come.

1143
00:42:39,730 --> 00:42:39,910
Come.

1144
00:42:39,910 --> 00:42:40,110
Come.

1145
00:42:40,270 --> 00:42:41,230
Kill him for me.

1146
00:42:41,230 --> 00:42:42,050
I'm getting a fold.

1147
00:42:43,210 --> 00:42:43,750
Don't worry.

1148
00:42:44,070 --> 00:42:45,070
I'm getting it.

1149
00:42:45,390 --> 00:42:46,350
I'm getting it.

1150
00:42:46,450 --> 00:42:48,790
What is your HP?

1151
00:42:51,150 --> 00:42:52,110
I told you.

1152
00:42:52,130 --> 00:42:53,070
I'm a big chonker.

1153
00:42:53,230 --> 00:42:54,050
You're so...

1154
00:42:54,050 --> 00:42:54,570
Alright.

1155
00:42:54,650 --> 00:42:55,450
Don't let it get away.

1156
00:42:56,290 --> 00:42:57,850
I can hop out now.

1157
00:42:57,950 --> 00:42:58,790
I can hop out.

1158
00:42:59,530 --> 00:43:00,030
Let's go.

1159
00:43:00,170 --> 00:43:01,470
Nom nom nom nom nom nom nom.

1160
00:43:01,470 --> 00:43:03,190
We will eat you.

1161
00:43:03,710 --> 00:43:06,570
We will eat you if it's the last thing we do.

1162
00:43:07,610 --> 00:43:09,270
Oh my god, he's like almost half.

1163
00:43:09,330 --> 00:43:10,430
He's like one fifth.

1164
00:43:10,650 --> 00:43:11,670
I need his jugular.

1165
00:43:11,710 --> 00:43:12,370
Oh my god.

1166
00:43:12,770 --> 00:43:14,110
Come on, we're so close.

1167
00:43:23,410 --> 00:43:25,170
Okay, I'm fucked up right now.

1168
00:43:25,190 --> 00:43:25,990
I need to chill.

1169
00:43:31,950 --> 00:43:33,270
Never give up!

1170
00:43:33,450 --> 00:43:35,110
What would Zats get saved?

1171
00:43:35,650 --> 00:43:36,370
One more!

1172
00:43:37,030 --> 00:43:37,830
One more, please.

1173
00:43:38,370 --> 00:43:39,290
He's like 1 HP!

1174
00:43:39,410 --> 00:43:39,870
He's like 1 HP!

1175
00:43:40,270 --> 00:43:40,950
Come on!

1176
00:43:41,610 --> 00:43:42,050
Yes!

1177
00:43:42,210 --> 00:43:42,570
Yes!

1178
00:43:43,090 --> 00:43:44,590
Alright, it's time to eat.

1179
00:43:45,710 --> 00:43:48,430
No gore, low gore, or more gore?

1180
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:49,150
More...

1181
00:43:49,150 --> 00:43:49,910
You know what?

1182
00:43:50,090 --> 00:43:50,930
More gore.

1183
00:43:51,250 --> 00:43:51,690
Yeah.

1184
00:43:52,550 --> 00:43:55,750
Oh, these claws are eating our food!

1185
00:43:57,770 --> 00:43:58,510
It's my food.

1186
00:43:58,630 --> 00:43:59,270
How do I eat it?

1187
00:43:59,450 --> 00:44:00,890
And then press... Oh, okay.

1188
00:44:00,990 --> 00:44:01,450
How do I eat it?

1189
00:44:01,470 --> 00:44:01,790
How do I eat this?

1190
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:03,030
Oh, okay.

1191
00:44:03,450 --> 00:44:04,590
Space, space, space.

1192
00:44:05,210 --> 00:44:07,150
How to remember carcass.

1193
00:44:07,230 --> 00:44:08,790
You may want to return to this carcass.

1194
00:44:08,990 --> 00:44:10,230
How to remember... Oh, okay.

1195
00:44:10,690 --> 00:44:11,170
Okay.

1196
00:44:11,450 --> 00:44:11,670
Okay.

1197
00:44:11,910 --> 00:44:12,290
Oh!

1198
00:44:28,710 --> 00:44:29,190
Ow!

1199
00:44:29,270 --> 00:44:29,530
Yeah!

1200
00:44:30,990 --> 00:44:32,050
Can I eat the crow?

1201
00:44:33,630 --> 00:44:34,910
Can I eat the crow?

1202
00:44:36,750 --> 00:44:38,750
It's not a carnivore, so...

1203
00:44:38,750 --> 00:44:40,190
It should be fine.

1204
00:44:40,430 --> 00:44:40,630
Oh!

1205
00:44:41,450 --> 00:44:42,810
I can like pick it up.

1206
00:44:43,130 --> 00:44:44,430
Okay, to rest.

1207
00:44:44,630 --> 00:44:45,390
Sit down.

1208
00:44:45,610 --> 00:44:46,210
And then pressed.

1209
00:44:46,370 --> 00:44:47,050
Okay, I'm gonna sleep.

1210
00:44:48,170 --> 00:44:48,790
Good night.

1211
00:44:49,010 --> 00:44:50,490
How do I eat what I picked up?

1212
00:44:50,850 --> 00:44:54,850
I think it's like to... If we have a den, we can like...

1213
00:44:56,390 --> 00:44:58,890
Like, store our food or something.

1214
00:44:59,790 --> 00:45:01,170
I'm pretty sure.

1215
00:45:01,690 --> 00:45:02,390
Alright, sleep.

1216
00:45:02,730 --> 00:45:03,270
I'm gonna heal.

1217
00:45:04,170 --> 00:45:05,050
Ah, eep.

1218
00:45:05,810 --> 00:45:06,250
Eepy.

1219
00:45:06,330 --> 00:45:07,030
Mi mi mi mi mi.

1220
00:45:07,890 --> 00:45:09,290
Mi mi mi mi mi mi.

1221
00:45:09,470 --> 00:45:10,070
Is that it?

1222
00:45:12,150 --> 00:45:13,790
No, it's really just... We're just eeping.

1223
00:45:14,030 --> 00:45:14,690
Are we...

1224
00:45:14,690 --> 00:45:16,170
Are we... are we healed?

1225
00:45:16,370 --> 00:45:17,530
Oh my god, the sun is gone!

1226
00:45:18,770 --> 00:45:19,890
It's so dark.

1227
00:45:19,930 --> 00:45:21,010
Oh my god, it's night time.

1228
00:45:23,290 --> 00:45:24,410
Oh, we did it!

1229
00:45:24,670 --> 00:45:25,910
Why are we still fucked up?

1230
00:45:26,190 --> 00:45:27,030
That is little...

1231
00:45:27,450 --> 00:45:28,710
I healed so little.

1232
00:45:28,850 --> 00:45:31,170
I barely healed, what?

1233
00:45:31,830 --> 00:45:33,830
I healed like 10%!

1234
00:45:33,950 --> 00:45:34,890
What is this?

1235
00:45:34,910 --> 00:45:37,290
What is this bullshit?

1236
00:45:38,030 --> 00:45:40,810
We killed Amuse and this is all we get?

1237
00:45:41,550 --> 00:45:43,470
I still have a broken paw.

1238
00:45:45,130 --> 00:45:45,690
Damn.

1239
00:45:46,850 --> 00:45:48,590
Wait, I forgot to eat.

1240
00:45:48,790 --> 00:45:50,610
It's because I forgot to eat.

1241
00:45:50,670 --> 00:45:50,970
Oops.

1242
00:45:51,170 --> 00:45:52,250
I didn't eat.

1243
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:53,390
How to heal.

1244
00:45:53,750 --> 00:45:54,310
Wait.

1245
00:45:56,110 --> 00:45:57,310
Oh, if you press R.

1246
00:45:57,610 --> 00:45:58,950
Yeah, but I didn't even eat.

1247
00:46:00,490 --> 00:46:03,150
Oh, it takes hunger and then...

1248
00:46:03,150 --> 00:46:04,070
Am I eating?

1249
00:46:04,230 --> 00:46:04,830
Am I eating?

1250
00:46:04,930 --> 00:46:05,230
Okay.

1251
00:46:05,690 --> 00:46:06,430
I'm eating.

1252
00:46:07,430 --> 00:46:08,210
Don't worry.

1253
00:46:08,910 --> 00:46:10,970
Food will cure your broken leg.

1254
00:46:11,070 --> 00:46:12,290
We don't need medicine.

1255
00:46:12,390 --> 00:46:13,550
This is home remedies.

1256
00:46:15,310 --> 00:46:15,750
Alright.

1257
00:46:16,310 --> 00:46:17,730
I'm eating as much as I can.

1258
00:46:20,010 --> 00:46:21,670
You can use quick heal.

1259
00:46:22,310 --> 00:46:24,250
Yeah, you press R repeatedly.

1260
00:46:24,690 --> 00:46:26,070
You can quick heal.

1261
00:46:26,250 --> 00:46:28,010
Oh, the orange bar is our food reserve.

1262
00:46:28,670 --> 00:46:29,650
I'm learning so much.

1263
00:46:29,710 --> 00:46:31,630
See, I knew there were furries in this chat.

1264
00:46:31,790 --> 00:46:33,450
I knew how to play this game.

1265
00:46:33,890 --> 00:46:34,710
I knew it.

1266
00:46:34,910 --> 00:46:34,990
They know.

1267
00:46:35,050 --> 00:46:36,510
I knew you guys knew.

1268
00:46:37,410 --> 00:46:43,270
I knew you guys knew how to play this game.

1269
00:46:43,330 --> 00:46:43,870
You guys pretended.

1270
00:46:44,230 --> 00:46:44,670
I know.

1271
00:46:44,690 --> 00:46:45,790
I'm eating his butt.

1272
00:46:46,710 --> 00:46:46,990
Come on.

1273
00:46:48,330 --> 00:46:48,690
Alright.

1274
00:46:50,210 --> 00:46:51,750
I am healing now.

1275
00:46:52,310 --> 00:46:53,090
Oh my god.

1276
00:46:53,470 --> 00:46:53,850
Oh, wait.

1277
00:46:54,030 --> 00:46:54,410
I thought it was a rabbit.

1278
00:46:54,550 --> 00:46:55,210
Oh, no, no.

1279
00:46:55,230 --> 00:46:55,730
Don't kill them.

1280
00:46:55,810 --> 00:46:56,550
They're not food.

1281
00:46:56,750 --> 00:46:57,410
It doesn't matter.

1282
00:46:57,930 --> 00:46:58,550
They're not food.

1283
00:46:58,550 --> 00:46:59,350
I was like, wait, it's a rabbit.

1284
00:46:59,550 --> 00:47:00,830
I'm gonna get extra food.

1285
00:47:01,670 --> 00:47:02,270
Nom nom.

1286
00:47:06,750 --> 00:47:07,330
I sleep.

1287
00:47:08,270 --> 00:47:09,650
Mee, mee, mee, mee, mee, mee, mee.

1288
00:47:10,230 --> 00:47:12,310
Mee, mee, mee, mee, mee, mee, mee, mee, mee, mee.

1289
00:47:13,010 --> 00:47:14,350
Mee, mee, mee, mee, mee, mee, mee, mee.

1290
00:47:14,350 --> 00:47:16,070
Mee, mee, mee, mee, mee, mee, mee, mee, mee, mee.

1291
00:47:17,550 --> 00:47:17,950
Alright.

1292
00:47:17,950 --> 00:47:18,670
Are you sleepy?

1293
00:47:19,830 --> 00:47:21,730
Alright, we'll wake up when the sun's out.

1294
00:47:24,690 --> 00:47:25,090
I'm sleepy.

1295
00:47:25,090 --> 00:47:26,090
We need to find a house.

1296
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:29,890
How else are we gonna raise pups if we don't have a home for them?

1297
00:47:30,690 --> 00:47:31,650
We are homeless.

1298
00:47:31,730 --> 00:47:32,370
What the heck?

1299
00:47:33,030 --> 00:47:34,930
Wait, my leg is so fucked up.

1300
00:47:34,930 --> 00:47:34,950
No, I'm fine here.

1301
00:47:34,970 --> 00:47:35,590
What the heck?

1302
00:47:35,710 --> 00:47:36,490
My leg.

1303
00:47:36,550 --> 00:47:36,690
Let's go.

1304
00:47:36,890 --> 00:47:37,410
Alright, alright.

1305
00:47:37,530 --> 00:47:38,650
Let's find a den.

1306
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:41,070
We'll come back to this later.

1307
00:47:41,390 --> 00:47:42,610
Take a piece of me.

1308
00:47:42,610 --> 00:47:44,330
It's like a travel bag.

1309
00:47:45,330 --> 00:47:46,750
Yeah, like a travel bag.

1310
00:47:47,110 --> 00:47:48,390
Yeah, there we go.

1311
00:47:48,530 --> 00:47:50,210
Let me grab a travel bag real quick.

1312
00:47:50,470 --> 00:47:51,570
A doggy bag.

1313
00:47:52,590 --> 00:47:53,850
A little moose to go, you know?

1314
00:47:54,010 --> 00:47:54,470
Yeah, yeah.

1315
00:47:54,470 --> 00:47:55,690
Just a little moose to go.

1316
00:47:55,810 --> 00:47:56,690
Alright, let's find a den.

1317
00:47:57,290 --> 00:47:59,290
There has to be a den somewhere.

1318
00:47:59,290 --> 00:48:00,670
How do we sniff out a den?

1319
00:48:00,970 --> 00:48:04,070
I think we just have to like go around until we find a cave.

1320
00:48:04,590 --> 00:48:05,410
I'm pretty sure.

1321
00:48:05,430 --> 00:48:06,070
Alright, let's go.

1322
00:48:06,430 --> 00:48:07,730
There has to be a cave somewhere.

1323
00:48:09,090 --> 00:48:10,950
It shouldn't be too hard to find, right?

1324
00:48:11,010 --> 00:48:11,270
Yeah.

1325
00:48:11,270 --> 00:48:13,250
Like all the snow, like it cannot be hard to find a cave.

1326
00:48:13,250 --> 00:48:13,650
It's nature.

1327
00:48:13,690 --> 00:48:14,990
There has to be a hole somewhere.

1328
00:48:16,070 --> 00:48:17,470
There has to be a cave.

1329
00:48:18,030 --> 00:48:19,190
That's what nature's for.

1330
00:48:20,270 --> 00:48:20,750
Right?

1331
00:48:21,870 --> 00:48:22,350
Okay.

1332
00:48:22,350 --> 00:48:23,650
All I see is snow.

1333
00:48:24,250 --> 00:48:25,310
That's all I...

1334
00:48:25,310 --> 00:48:26,670
It's just snow, bro.

1335
00:48:26,670 --> 00:48:27,950
It's just snow and trees.

1336
00:48:28,110 --> 00:48:32,030
What's the point of saving the environment if it's just snow and trees?

1337
00:48:33,210 --> 00:48:35,290
What even is the point, man?

1338
00:48:35,430 --> 00:48:36,590
What's the point?

1339
00:48:36,870 --> 00:48:38,610
Trees don't even give wifi.

1340
00:48:38,750 --> 00:48:39,270
I know.

1341
00:48:42,070 --> 00:48:42,590
Useless.

1342
00:48:42,930 --> 00:48:45,950
What am I supposed to... I can't store food in my tree.

1343
00:48:46,290 --> 00:48:47,790
I'm not a fucking squirrel.

1344
00:48:52,630 --> 00:48:55,870
I wanna have like pouches, like dog pouches.

1345
00:48:55,930 --> 00:48:57,630
Dog pouches.

1346
00:48:57,630 --> 00:48:59,330
Or everything in my dog pouch.

1347
00:48:59,330 --> 00:49:01,870
Well, you should have fucking evolved to have thumbs.

1348
00:49:01,910 --> 00:49:03,170
That'd be allergic to shit.

1349
00:49:06,130 --> 00:49:08,070
Imagine not having thumbs.

1350
00:49:08,410 --> 00:49:09,570
Oh my god.

1351
00:49:09,650 --> 00:49:11,330
Just... that's so sad.

1352
00:49:11,710 --> 00:49:14,230
Imagine not having opposable thumbs.

1353
00:49:14,510 --> 00:49:16,130
Why is it all just snow?

1354
00:49:16,390 --> 00:49:18,210
I need to mark more territory?

1355
00:49:18,730 --> 00:49:20,490
I peed on so many things.

1356
00:49:20,630 --> 00:49:22,790
I didn't drink enough water for this.

1357
00:49:23,610 --> 00:49:26,570
Like, I only have so much pee in my bowl.

1358
00:49:26,610 --> 00:49:27,090
Yeah!

1359
00:49:27,090 --> 00:49:29,210
I can't keep marking territory.

1360
00:49:31,570 --> 00:49:32,970
What the heck, man?

1361
00:49:33,010 --> 00:49:33,150
What the heck, man?

1362
00:49:33,150 --> 00:49:37,190
There's not enough water here for all these trees.

1363
00:49:40,010 --> 00:49:41,670
God, the snow is deep.

1364
00:49:41,790 --> 00:49:42,490
Holy shit.

1365
00:49:42,770 --> 00:49:44,790
Oh my god, there's so much snow.

1366
00:49:45,070 --> 00:49:46,190
Fine, I'll pee twice.

1367
00:49:46,270 --> 00:49:47,810
They're like, dude, don't pee just once.

1368
00:49:47,990 --> 00:49:49,130
You gotta pee twice.

1369
00:49:51,150 --> 00:49:52,750
I might pee twice.

1370
00:49:53,030 --> 00:49:54,690
Oh my god, I lost Sasuke.

1371
00:49:55,150 --> 00:49:56,170
Where's Sasuke?

1372
00:49:57,590 --> 00:49:58,150
Sasuke!

1373
00:49:58,610 --> 00:49:58,930
Oh!

1374
00:49:59,950 --> 00:50:00,510
Oh!

1375
00:50:01,390 --> 00:50:01,950
Oh!

1376
00:50:03,150 --> 00:50:04,510
I found you!

1377
00:50:04,510 --> 00:50:04,810
I won!

1378
00:50:05,050 --> 00:50:05,970
Oh my god, I got you!

1379
00:50:06,850 --> 00:50:07,810
Oh my god, okay.

1380
00:50:08,050 --> 00:50:08,170
Yippee!

1381
00:50:08,570 --> 00:50:09,050
Yay!

1382
00:50:09,510 --> 00:50:12,370
We're still out here trying to find a cave.

1383
00:50:12,910 --> 00:50:14,690
Dude, what the fuck is the cave?

1384
00:50:15,570 --> 00:50:16,070
Where's the cave?

1385
00:50:16,070 --> 00:50:17,490
I don't even know if I've been looking for a cave.

1386
00:50:17,990 --> 00:50:21,190
Oh my god, look at the fucking path you made.

1387
00:50:22,990 --> 00:50:23,950
Holy shit.

1388
00:50:23,950 --> 00:50:24,450
It's pretty.

1389
00:50:24,610 --> 00:50:26,770
I can make a penis in the snow.

1390
00:50:27,910 --> 00:50:28,310
Oh yeah?

1391
00:50:28,450 --> 00:50:29,090
Me too.

1392
00:50:30,630 --> 00:50:32,330
Who has the biggest snow penis?

1393
00:50:34,830 --> 00:50:36,870
As if you didn't do it already.

1394
00:50:39,230 --> 00:50:41,890
I would never do such a thing.

1395
00:50:42,210 --> 00:50:44,290
This is a Christian wolf server.

1396
00:50:44,570 --> 00:50:46,190
This is a Christian-only server.

1397
00:50:46,370 --> 00:50:47,470
No profanity allowed.

1398
00:50:49,030 --> 00:50:50,510
It's called a Willy.

1399
00:50:50,850 --> 00:50:51,910
It's a Willy.

1400
00:50:53,210 --> 00:50:54,330
It's a wee-wee.

1401
00:50:54,330 --> 00:50:55,230
It's a wee-wee.

1402
00:50:55,350 --> 00:50:57,030
It's a wee-wee.

1403
00:50:57,330 --> 00:50:58,330
Wee-wee.

1404
00:51:00,050 --> 00:51:01,610
Why is Lily so fast?

1405
00:51:01,690 --> 00:51:02,890
Because I had...

1406
00:51:02,890 --> 00:51:05,270
I like reduced my speed for strength.

1407
00:51:05,670 --> 00:51:08,190
I invested in speed.

1408
00:51:08,490 --> 00:51:10,350
I invested in strength.

1409
00:51:11,290 --> 00:51:13,830
I knew speed was going to be important.

1410
00:51:14,230 --> 00:51:15,010
Oh my god.

1411
00:51:15,050 --> 00:51:15,870
Where's the cave?

1412
00:51:16,010 --> 00:51:17,310
There's no holes anywhere!

1413
00:51:18,070 --> 00:51:19,510
It's just snow!

1414
00:51:19,550 --> 00:51:20,110
At the border?

1415
00:51:21,030 --> 00:51:21,810
Wait, what?

1416
00:51:21,930 --> 00:51:22,650
You reached the border.

1417
00:51:23,310 --> 00:51:24,650
You reached the border?

1418
00:51:25,030 --> 00:51:26,630
Oh, we're at the edge of the map?

1419
00:51:26,930 --> 00:51:28,090
It forced me to go back.

1420
00:51:29,490 --> 00:51:30,690
Holy shit.

1421
00:51:31,130 --> 00:51:33,390
Oh, we have to claim more territory!

1422
00:51:34,750 --> 00:51:35,590
Wait, okay.

1423
00:51:36,330 --> 00:51:39,390
Okay, we have to go back, I think.

1424
00:51:39,790 --> 00:51:41,030
I think we have to go back.

1425
00:51:41,730 --> 00:51:42,170
Okay.

1426
00:51:42,350 --> 00:51:45,690
We have to go back to all the stuff we peed on.

1427
00:51:45,710 --> 00:51:45,930
Wait, wait.

1428
00:51:46,530 --> 00:51:48,590
Yeah, go back to the moose.

1429
00:51:49,090 --> 00:51:50,730
I think I understand something.

1430
00:51:50,990 --> 00:51:52,450
I have to investigate real quick.

1431
00:51:52,730 --> 00:51:53,110
Okay, okay.

1432
00:51:53,210 --> 00:51:54,770
I think I'm smelling things.

1433
00:51:55,050 --> 00:51:55,990
You're smelling things?

1434
00:51:56,190 --> 00:51:56,350
I think I'm smelling.

1435
00:51:56,870 --> 00:51:57,310
Yeah.

1436
00:51:57,410 --> 00:51:58,590
I think I'm smelling.

1437
00:51:58,990 --> 00:51:59,810
Okay, okay.

1438
00:51:59,850 --> 00:52:00,530
What are you smelling?

1439
00:52:01,050 --> 00:52:01,910
I don't know.

1440
00:52:02,050 --> 00:52:05,710
I'm following the icon to figure out what it is I'm smelling.

1441
00:52:06,310 --> 00:52:07,430
Maybe it's a den.

1442
00:52:07,610 --> 00:52:08,050
Who knows?

1443
00:52:09,690 --> 00:52:10,110
Okay.

1444
00:52:10,230 --> 00:52:10,690
What am I smelling?

1445
00:52:11,010 --> 00:52:12,530
Whoa, there's so many smells!

1446
00:52:13,510 --> 00:52:14,970
What are all these smells?

1447
00:52:15,790 --> 00:52:17,150
So many smells.

1448
00:52:17,810 --> 00:52:18,790
It's so far away.

1449
00:52:18,910 --> 00:52:19,990
I thought it was going to be much closer.

1450
00:52:20,070 --> 00:52:20,390
What the heck?

1451
00:52:20,510 --> 00:52:20,770
Oh my god.

1452
00:52:22,010 --> 00:52:23,790
Wait, why is this one so far away?

1453
00:52:24,190 --> 00:52:29,830
There's like a prawn horn, a snowshoe hare, a mule...

1454
00:52:29,830 --> 00:52:30,030
Oh!

1455
00:52:31,670 --> 00:52:33,750
I'm smelling so many things.

1456
00:52:34,910 --> 00:52:35,930
This is how it works.

1457
00:52:36,010 --> 00:52:37,090
Do I pee on the smell now?

1458
00:52:38,010 --> 00:52:38,490
Yes!

1459
00:52:38,490 --> 00:52:39,970
I figured out the game!

1460
00:52:40,330 --> 00:52:41,150
You figured it out?

1461
00:52:41,150 --> 00:52:41,270
Yeah!

1462
00:52:41,270 --> 00:52:41,590
How?

1463
00:52:42,710 --> 00:52:47,030
So, that was this icon on the map and I just peed on the icon.

1464
00:52:47,210 --> 00:52:48,190
And now...

1465
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:51,670
I just peed on it.

1466
00:52:51,770 --> 00:52:52,730
And now it's mine.

1467
00:52:55,250 --> 00:52:56,830
It's just that easy, guys.

1468
00:52:58,390 --> 00:52:59,770
Just pee on it.

1469
00:53:00,030 --> 00:53:00,950
There's a kaiouri!

1470
00:53:02,870 --> 00:53:04,230
Yeah, I've marked it as mine.

1471
00:53:04,290 --> 00:53:06,930
Now I have to wait again to reinforce my mark.

1472
00:53:07,310 --> 00:53:08,050
Okay, okay, okay.

1473
00:53:08,190 --> 00:53:08,570
Let me...

1474
00:53:08,570 --> 00:53:09,530
Okay, I'll come to you.

1475
00:53:09,750 --> 00:53:10,830
Alright, I'm going to pee as well.

1476
00:53:11,390 --> 00:53:12,250
Just in case.

1477
00:53:13,750 --> 00:53:14,590
Just to make sure.

1478
00:53:14,730 --> 00:53:16,150
Yeah, just in case.

1479
00:53:17,370 --> 00:53:21,130
I just need to make sure I have this post.

1480
00:53:21,950 --> 00:53:24,410
You know, it's like double tap, but for pee.

1481
00:53:24,650 --> 00:53:25,230
Double tap?

1482
00:53:26,110 --> 00:53:27,610
But double pee is just like...

1483
00:53:27,610 --> 00:53:28,730
Two beams?

1484
00:53:28,730 --> 00:53:29,250
Yeah!

1485
00:53:29,670 --> 00:53:30,070
What?

1486
00:53:30,670 --> 00:53:31,070
What?

1487
00:53:31,230 --> 00:53:31,450
You don't have double...

1488
00:53:31,450 --> 00:53:31,950
I hear wolves!

1489
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:32,690
Is that you?

1490
00:53:32,830 --> 00:53:33,550
Are you howling?

1491
00:53:33,650 --> 00:53:33,910
No.

1492
00:53:34,450 --> 00:53:35,230
That's not our wolves.

1493
00:53:35,230 --> 00:53:36,750
I hear howls.

1494
00:53:36,930 --> 00:53:37,650
That's not our wolves.

1495
00:53:39,530 --> 00:53:41,830
That's not... We can convert wolves into our pack though.

1496
00:53:43,150 --> 00:53:44,470
Yeah, I'll howl back.

1497
00:53:44,890 --> 00:53:45,570
Where are they?

1498
00:53:45,570 --> 00:53:46,310
Why are they not friendly?

1499
00:53:46,830 --> 00:53:47,470
Wait, wait, wait.

1500
00:53:47,470 --> 00:53:47,930
I don't...

1501
00:53:47,930 --> 00:53:49,770
But if you look at the map...

1502
00:53:49,770 --> 00:53:52,510
I'm quite a bit away from you.

1503
00:53:52,710 --> 00:53:53,110
Okay.

1504
00:53:53,110 --> 00:53:53,930
I followed the same...

1505
00:53:53,930 --> 00:53:54,590
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1506
00:53:54,590 --> 00:53:56,110
I'm just going to keep peeing.

1507
00:53:56,750 --> 00:53:57,350
I'm going to...

1508
00:53:57,350 --> 00:53:59,270
I'm going to keep peeing.

1509
00:53:59,510 --> 00:54:01,370
We need more territory.

1510
00:54:01,790 --> 00:54:04,190
I'm just going to keep peeing on stuff.

1511
00:54:05,890 --> 00:54:07,130
Just keep peeing.

1512
00:54:07,270 --> 00:54:08,390
Oh, above 50%!

1513
00:54:09,210 --> 00:54:14,390
It's most efficient to let Hex drop to 30% since you can boost him to 100% one action.

1514
00:54:14,690 --> 00:54:18,150
On your marking trip, visit as many Hexes in a short trip as possible.

1515
00:54:18,390 --> 00:54:19,690
When can we have a home?

1516
00:54:19,830 --> 00:54:22,610
I just want to have a home and make puppies.

1517
00:54:22,810 --> 00:54:23,510
Like that's...

1518
00:54:24,130 --> 00:54:25,890
I just want to breed.

1519
00:54:31,970 --> 00:54:32,870
Oh, my God.

1520
00:54:33,010 --> 00:54:33,530
Oh, my God.

1521
00:54:33,530 --> 00:54:36,250
Okay, but to steal somebody's puppies, we need to find the puppy.

1522
00:54:37,350 --> 00:54:39,530
Yeah, I was so close to finding the walls.

1523
00:54:39,670 --> 00:54:40,410
Where did they go?

1524
00:54:40,870 --> 00:54:42,790
I heard them and then they're gone.

1525
00:54:43,150 --> 00:54:43,710
Where are you?

1526
00:54:43,710 --> 00:54:44,910
Wait, let me see if I can find you.

1527
00:54:44,970 --> 00:54:45,130
Okay.

1528
00:54:45,230 --> 00:54:46,250
Oh, Saskia's over here.

1529
00:54:46,330 --> 00:54:46,550
Okay.

1530
00:54:46,610 --> 00:54:47,270
I'm going to head over.

1531
00:54:47,790 --> 00:54:48,690
Saskia, I'm hiding over.

1532
00:54:50,330 --> 00:54:51,050
Come quickly.

1533
00:54:51,890 --> 00:54:52,250
Family.

1534
00:54:53,010 --> 00:54:53,370
Family.

1535
00:54:54,290 --> 00:54:54,650
Family.

1536
00:54:55,210 --> 00:54:55,330
Family.

1537
00:54:55,330 --> 00:54:55,470
Family.

1538
00:54:55,710 --> 00:54:56,070
Family.

1539
00:54:56,070 --> 00:54:56,250
Family.

1540
00:54:56,250 --> 00:54:56,310
Family.

1541
00:54:56,310 --> 00:54:56,510
Family.

1542
00:54:56,510 --> 00:54:56,550
Family.

1543
00:54:57,330 --> 00:54:58,970
Oh, I think I found you.

1544
00:54:58,970 --> 00:54:59,710
Oh, that's our pack territory.

1545
00:55:00,110 --> 00:55:00,910
We have...

1546
00:55:00,910 --> 00:55:01,610
Oh, my God.

1547
00:55:01,650 --> 00:55:03,230
This is like a fucking board game.

1548
00:55:03,350 --> 00:55:04,170
What is this?

1549
00:55:04,650 --> 00:55:05,250
Oh, yeah.

1550
00:55:05,270 --> 00:55:05,870
What the heck?

1551
00:55:05,890 --> 00:55:06,250
Yeah.

1552
00:55:06,290 --> 00:55:07,550
Look at these tiles.

1553
00:55:08,070 --> 00:55:10,110
It reminds me of like fucking...

1554
00:55:10,110 --> 00:55:10,990
What?

1555
00:55:11,110 --> 00:55:11,530
Risk.

1556
00:55:11,750 --> 00:55:12,050
Yeah.

1557
00:55:14,950 --> 00:55:15,430
Damn.

1558
00:55:15,530 --> 00:55:15,970
This is...

1559
00:55:15,970 --> 00:55:17,230
This goes deep.

1560
00:55:17,370 --> 00:55:17,950
What the heck?

1561
00:55:17,970 --> 00:55:18,610
Holy shit.

1562
00:55:19,510 --> 00:55:20,510
You mean for...

1563
00:55:20,510 --> 00:55:24,510
Honestly, for two walls, having three of that is like pretty nice.

1564
00:55:24,650 --> 00:55:25,510
Not going to lie.

1565
00:55:25,650 --> 00:55:27,150
I would say so too, right?

1566
00:55:27,230 --> 00:55:27,310
Yeah.

1567
00:55:27,330 --> 00:55:29,010
We have three of these.

1568
00:55:29,030 --> 00:55:32,350
We have the three marked territories.

1569
00:55:32,490 --> 00:55:34,610
Okay, we need more wolves in this pack.

1570
00:55:34,930 --> 00:55:36,390
We need more wolves.

1571
00:55:37,050 --> 00:55:38,930
Where did the other wolves go?

1572
00:55:39,350 --> 00:55:40,550
Where are these other wolves?

1573
00:55:40,610 --> 00:55:42,350
We want to steal your children.

1574
00:55:43,090 --> 00:55:45,090
I don't want to steal.

1575
00:55:45,590 --> 00:55:47,850
Please give up your first boy for me.

1576
00:55:47,850 --> 00:55:48,930
Please, for us.

1577
00:55:49,270 --> 00:55:52,490
How are we going to start a pack if we can't steal your kids?

1578
00:55:55,030 --> 00:55:56,810
Oh, I found something to mic.

1579
00:55:56,810 --> 00:55:57,710
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1580
00:55:57,710 --> 00:55:57,990
Where?

1581
00:55:58,650 --> 00:55:59,630
Yeah, pee on it.

1582
00:56:00,390 --> 00:56:01,590
Alright, me too.

1583
00:56:01,670 --> 00:56:02,650
I'll pee just in case.

1584
00:56:03,350 --> 00:56:04,690
Just in case.

1585
00:56:05,990 --> 00:56:07,030
Just in case.

1586
00:56:07,350 --> 00:56:07,790
Alright.

1587
00:56:08,190 --> 00:56:08,630
Nice.

1588
00:56:08,650 --> 00:56:09,110
We got it.

1589
00:56:09,210 --> 00:56:11,050
Okay, we have to find a den.

1590
00:56:11,710 --> 00:56:14,070
If we find a den, maybe there will be already kids inside.

1591
00:56:15,550 --> 00:56:17,090
Like a Christmas present?

1592
00:56:17,250 --> 00:56:18,490
Santa just brought us kids?

1593
00:56:18,830 --> 00:56:19,230
Yeah, yeah.

1594
00:56:20,010 --> 00:56:20,670
We're Santa.

1595
00:56:23,810 --> 00:56:26,270
We're Santa taking away the kids.

1596
00:56:27,430 --> 00:56:31,630
Remember, don't be naughty or Santa's going to come over and take your children.

1597
00:56:32,590 --> 00:56:34,690
Santa, why is your sack empty?

1598
00:56:34,810 --> 00:56:35,730
Don't worry, young boy.

1599
00:56:35,950 --> 00:56:37,290
It will not be empty for very long.

1600
00:56:37,290 --> 00:56:38,350
Yeah, it'll be full soon.

1601
00:56:39,070 --> 00:56:39,810
Just hop on in.

1602
00:56:43,170 --> 00:56:44,530
Don't worry, just hop on in.

1603
00:56:44,910 --> 00:56:45,650
Yeah, yeah.

1604
00:56:45,750 --> 00:56:46,790
Don't think about it.

1605
00:56:46,890 --> 00:56:48,730
Okay, maybe we go the right side.

1606
00:56:48,950 --> 00:56:49,910
Okay, we gotta...

1607
00:56:49,910 --> 00:56:51,770
Why is it always snowing here?

1608
00:56:52,310 --> 00:56:52,750
Right?

1609
00:56:52,810 --> 00:56:54,570
What the heck is a den?

1610
00:56:54,890 --> 00:56:56,790
How do I... Why can I live out of this?

1611
00:56:56,810 --> 00:56:58,970
All these roads, they're hibernating!

1612
00:56:59,190 --> 00:57:00,750
What the fuck are we supposed to do?

1613
00:57:01,890 --> 00:57:02,270
Right?

1614
00:57:03,890 --> 00:57:05,030
Where do I go?

1615
00:57:05,350 --> 00:57:07,470
I have to find... Okay, maybe I zoom in?

1616
00:57:08,470 --> 00:57:11,150
Okay, I'm gonna... I'm gonna head straight.

1617
00:57:11,450 --> 00:57:13,430
There must be a cave right there.

1618
00:57:13,830 --> 00:57:15,530
I'm gonna head straight down.

1619
00:57:15,990 --> 00:57:17,350
I'm not hungry anyway.

1620
00:57:17,950 --> 00:57:19,630
I'm gonna head straight down.

1621
00:57:19,990 --> 00:57:25,230
I will find... I will find a hole to make it in my home.

1622
00:57:25,230 --> 00:57:26,710
I thought you were saying straight down, but um...

1623
00:57:26,810 --> 00:57:29,430
Your walking line is anything but straight.

1624
00:57:29,550 --> 00:57:30,310
It's straight!

1625
00:57:30,510 --> 00:57:31,530
What do you mean?

1626
00:57:32,270 --> 00:57:33,890
It is so straight.

1627
00:57:33,990 --> 00:57:35,310
I don't know what you're talking about.

1628
00:57:35,870 --> 00:57:37,310
Yeah, that is definitely a straight line.

1629
00:57:37,310 --> 00:57:38,850
Oh, you're talking about...

1630
00:57:43,250 --> 00:57:44,530
Don't worry, don't worry.

1631
00:57:44,690 --> 00:57:46,250
Maybe there's something wrong with your eyes.

1632
00:57:46,490 --> 00:57:47,090
You know?

1633
00:57:47,870 --> 00:57:50,070
Maybe... No, maybe I did buy the blind eye DLC.

1634
00:57:50,130 --> 00:57:50,830
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1635
00:57:50,850 --> 00:57:52,890
You got blind eye DLC.

1636
00:57:53,070 --> 00:57:54,830
Oh, wait, there's some scents.

1637
00:57:54,830 --> 00:57:56,710
An oil lamp.

1638
00:57:57,030 --> 00:57:58,150
A cougar.

1639
00:57:58,610 --> 00:58:00,210
Oh, an elk herd is nearby.

1640
00:58:00,690 --> 00:58:03,430
Okay, we don't... Where's this red oil lamp thing?

1641
00:58:03,830 --> 00:58:05,030
It stopped snowing.

1642
00:58:05,030 --> 00:58:06,290
I don't see the red oil lamp.

1643
00:58:06,330 --> 00:58:07,130
That's only you.

1644
00:58:07,270 --> 00:58:08,210
Oh, you press... If you hold V...

1645
00:58:08,730 --> 00:58:11,470
If you press V, do you see the question mark?

1646
00:58:11,590 --> 00:58:11,810
Oh, yeah!

1647
00:58:11,810 --> 00:58:12,310
What the heck?

1648
00:58:12,310 --> 00:58:13,230
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

1649
00:58:13,390 --> 00:58:14,170
I'm following it.

1650
00:58:14,850 --> 00:58:15,690
I'm gonna follow it.

1651
00:58:16,330 --> 00:58:17,290
Ground scents.

1652
00:58:17,390 --> 00:58:18,630
Pick up the object.

1653
00:58:19,370 --> 00:58:20,170
Wait, what?

1654
00:58:20,410 --> 00:58:20,610
Oh!

1655
00:58:20,770 --> 00:58:21,690
It's a collectible!

1656
00:58:23,050 --> 00:58:24,010
A collectible.

1657
00:58:25,790 --> 00:58:26,270
Oh!

1658
00:58:26,450 --> 00:58:27,510
How do we pick it up?

1659
00:58:27,550 --> 00:58:28,650
Do we just grab it?

1660
00:58:28,870 --> 00:58:29,750
Grab it?

1661
00:58:30,190 --> 00:58:31,030
You grab it?

1662
00:58:31,150 --> 00:58:31,670
Holds... Oh!

1663
00:58:31,770 --> 00:58:32,970
I just held space.

1664
00:58:33,010 --> 00:58:34,370
Alright, now we have a lamp.

1665
00:58:34,970 --> 00:58:36,010
We have a lamp!

1666
00:58:36,370 --> 00:58:39,230
Alright, we don't have a home, but we have a lamp.

1667
00:58:39,870 --> 00:58:42,030
Alright, there's a...

1668
00:58:42,770 --> 00:58:44,370
There's a deer right here.

1669
00:58:45,210 --> 00:58:46,530
Where the fuck are the holes?

1670
00:58:47,890 --> 00:58:51,050
If we travel hard enough, we will find a cave.

1671
00:58:51,410 --> 00:58:52,350
That is our...

1672
00:58:52,350 --> 00:58:54,750
We end stream when we find a cave.

1673
00:58:54,830 --> 00:58:55,310
We end stream when we find a cave.

1674
00:58:55,310 --> 00:58:58,350
That will be it.

1675
00:58:58,350 --> 00:58:59,270
We will get the cave.

1676
00:58:59,370 --> 00:59:02,990
We get the cave and then we end stream.

1677
00:59:04,210 --> 00:59:04,690
We get the cave and then we end stream.

1678
00:59:04,690 --> 00:59:05,750
Anyway, thanks for watching.

1679
00:59:05,950 --> 00:59:06,710
Thanks for watching.

1680
00:59:06,790 --> 00:59:07,810
We have a house now.

1681
00:59:08,030 --> 00:59:09,330
We have a house now.

1682
00:59:10,410 --> 00:59:12,130
I'm sorry, but I have a house now.

1683
00:59:12,170 --> 00:59:12,830
I'm better than that.

1684
00:59:15,910 --> 00:59:17,350
I swear to God.

1685
00:59:17,450 --> 00:59:18,630
I swear to God.

1686
00:59:18,770 --> 00:59:24,730
I'm gonna save this game and then open the server and then have our fancy just out of the play.

1687
00:59:26,070 --> 00:59:30,470
I just go like, I just go like, wouldn't it be funny to check back into the game?

1688
00:59:30,510 --> 00:59:31,650
There's a freaking mansion.

1689
00:59:31,790 --> 00:59:38,290
We just open the server and I was like, We just open the server and I was like, Alright, let's...

1690
00:59:39,710 --> 00:59:40,550
Let's have a look.

1691
00:59:40,610 --> 00:59:41,130
Oh my.

1692
00:59:41,310 --> 00:59:43,970
A 50 hour wolf plus wolf pack player.

1693
00:59:45,290 --> 00:59:46,810
It would be so funny.

1694
00:59:48,670 --> 00:59:50,330
You think I'm bluffing?

1695
00:59:50,410 --> 00:59:51,090
I would do.

1696
00:59:52,590 --> 00:59:53,110
I've done it before.

1697
00:59:54,370 --> 00:59:57,910
I fucking outsourced it to my tragoons.

1698
00:59:59,090 --> 01:00:00,390
I'm not ashamed.

1699
01:00:00,650 --> 01:00:03,870
Distinguished gentlemen, welcome to my humble mansion.

1700
01:00:06,950 --> 01:00:09,510
Did some mining off stream.

1701
01:00:10,370 --> 01:00:12,530
Some casual off stream mining.

1702
01:00:12,690 --> 01:00:13,570
I'm pissing this.

1703
01:00:13,750 --> 01:00:15,030
I'm making this mine.

1704
01:00:15,210 --> 01:00:17,430
You're making this random piece of snow yours.

1705
01:00:17,510 --> 01:00:18,650
I don't know.

1706
01:00:18,690 --> 01:00:19,350
It was mine.

1707
01:00:19,650 --> 01:00:22,330
It was peeable for some reason.

1708
01:00:22,590 --> 01:00:26,890
I like how someone in my chat was like, why aren't you peeing?

1709
01:00:30,410 --> 01:00:31,870
Why aren't you peeing?

1710
01:00:32,050 --> 01:00:33,810
Why aren't you establishing territory?

1711
01:00:33,990 --> 01:00:35,170
Fine, I'm gonna pee.

1712
01:00:36,230 --> 01:00:37,270
Okay, peeing.

1713
01:00:38,670 --> 01:00:39,370
Territory, territory.

1714
01:00:39,670 --> 01:00:40,810
I got this, don't worry.

1715
01:00:41,690 --> 01:00:42,810
Don't worry, I got this.

1716
01:00:43,470 --> 01:00:44,150
Don't worry.

1717
01:00:44,410 --> 01:00:45,630
If we don't find...

1718
01:00:45,630 --> 01:00:51,150
If we don't find a house, I swear in the next 10 minutes, server's gonna be open.

1719
01:00:52,430 --> 01:00:56,610
We're gonna open this server and you're gonna help us find a house.

1720
01:00:57,590 --> 01:01:00,310
Dragoons and... wait, what are your fans called?

1721
01:01:01,750 --> 01:01:03,970
They call themselves shrimps.

1722
01:01:04,650 --> 01:01:06,050
Dragoons, shrimps, unite.

1723
01:01:06,290 --> 01:01:09,650
Find Lily and Doki at cave.

1724
01:01:11,710 --> 01:01:13,590
Find me a cave, young ones.

1725
01:01:15,930 --> 01:01:16,610
Babies!

1726
01:01:18,150 --> 01:01:20,390
Now make babies for us.

1727
01:01:20,690 --> 01:01:21,730
Now make babies for us.

1728
01:01:21,730 --> 01:01:23,830
The shrimps and the dragoons.

1729
01:01:25,190 --> 01:01:25,910
The shrimps and the dragoons.

1730
01:01:26,790 --> 01:01:28,610
The shrimp goons.

1731
01:01:28,630 --> 01:01:30,610
Create the shrimp goons.

1732
01:01:30,990 --> 01:01:31,570
Create.

1733
01:01:32,130 --> 01:01:35,130
Oh god, it went by the shrimp goon cave.

1734
01:01:35,270 --> 01:01:35,910
What the heck?

1735
01:01:37,110 --> 01:01:40,590
We require shrimp goons now.

1736
01:01:40,810 --> 01:01:41,970
Shrimp goons.

1737
01:01:43,870 --> 01:01:49,590
How the heck do I find... surely there is a system as to how to find a cave.

1738
01:01:49,890 --> 01:01:51,110
Surely there is.

1739
01:01:51,150 --> 01:01:51,670
Wait, wait.

1740
01:01:51,850 --> 01:01:55,470
First we have to pee on this tree before someone yells at us.

1741
01:01:55,530 --> 01:01:57,370
Let me pee on this tree real quick.

1742
01:01:57,790 --> 01:01:59,250
I don't wanna get yelled at.

1743
01:01:59,430 --> 01:02:01,210
You can't see it but I peed.

1744
01:02:01,230 --> 01:02:01,870
I peed, I swear.

1745
01:02:02,270 --> 01:02:02,730
Alright, alright, alright.

1746
01:02:02,810 --> 01:02:03,210
Let's see.

1747
01:02:03,530 --> 01:02:04,990
Oh, look at our territory!

1748
01:02:05,590 --> 01:02:07,670
Now we have four hexagons.

1749
01:02:07,670 --> 01:02:07,990
Did we make it?

1750
01:02:08,430 --> 01:02:08,870
Yo!

1751
01:02:08,970 --> 01:02:10,410
I don't know what we're doing.

1752
01:02:11,530 --> 01:02:12,410
We expanded!

1753
01:02:12,830 --> 01:02:14,090
See, child, we peed.

1754
01:02:14,210 --> 01:02:14,650
We expanded!

1755
01:02:15,630 --> 01:02:16,330
We peed.

1756
01:02:16,330 --> 01:02:16,590
Oh my god.

1757
01:02:16,610 --> 01:02:16,970
Oh my god!

1758
01:02:18,510 --> 01:02:23,750
Abandoned burrows made by wolves, foxes, and coyotes just need to be expanded to your needs.

1759
01:02:24,530 --> 01:02:25,150
Okay.

1760
01:02:25,350 --> 01:02:26,530
We have to find...

1761
01:02:26,530 --> 01:02:27,370
Okay, then what is it?

1762
01:02:27,750 --> 01:02:29,950
We have never seen holes before.

1763
01:02:30,970 --> 01:02:31,970
What do you mean?

1764
01:02:31,970 --> 01:02:33,230
I'm looking for holes everywhere.

1765
01:02:33,250 --> 01:02:34,170
There is no holes.

1766
01:02:34,270 --> 01:02:35,290
There's no holes anywhere.

1767
01:02:35,930 --> 01:02:37,650
Keep peeing, ducky!

1768
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:38,710
Okay!

1769
01:02:38,830 --> 01:02:39,970
I'm gonna keep peeing!

1770
01:02:40,930 --> 01:02:41,550
Pee!

1771
01:02:42,590 --> 01:02:44,010
Oh my god.

1772
01:02:44,010 --> 01:02:45,670
How do I have all this water?

1773
01:02:48,870 --> 01:02:49,830
Too soon!

1774
01:02:50,090 --> 01:02:51,290
So it's like you need a...

1775
01:02:51,290 --> 01:02:52,690
You got a min-max.

1776
01:02:54,350 --> 01:02:55,710
Min-max to piss me.

1777
01:02:55,930 --> 01:02:56,070
What the fuck?

1778
01:02:56,070 --> 01:02:57,570
You mean min-max.

1779
01:02:58,030 --> 01:02:58,930
Alright, alright, alright.

1780
01:02:58,970 --> 01:02:59,470
Okay, fine.

1781
01:02:59,650 --> 01:03:01,370
I'll pee on this next tree I find.

1782
01:03:01,970 --> 01:03:02,670
Right here.

1783
01:03:02,710 --> 01:03:03,870
That should be a hexagon.

1784
01:03:03,950 --> 01:03:04,630
Right here.

1785
01:03:06,050 --> 01:03:06,530
Boom.

1786
01:03:06,530 --> 01:03:07,010
Boom.

1787
01:03:07,070 --> 01:03:07,490
Alright.

1788
01:03:07,870 --> 01:03:08,790
Get peed on.

1789
01:03:09,070 --> 01:03:09,650
Here you go.

1790
01:03:09,850 --> 01:03:11,170
Wait, what is my purple bar?

1791
01:03:11,170 --> 01:03:12,790
What is your... Yeah, what is...

1792
01:03:12,790 --> 01:03:13,450
Is that a pee bar?

1793
01:03:14,710 --> 01:03:15,610
What is that?

1794
01:03:16,210 --> 01:03:17,050
What is it?

1795
01:03:17,270 --> 01:03:21,130
What is the purple bar?

1796
01:03:22,510 --> 01:03:24,470
What is the purple pee bar?

1797
01:03:25,870 --> 01:03:27,890
Oh, it's the rest bar.

1798
01:03:28,010 --> 01:03:30,750
It means we will need rest when it's too low.

1799
01:03:31,110 --> 01:03:32,390
Oh, I have to eep.

1800
01:03:33,070 --> 01:03:33,550
Alright.

1801
01:03:34,110 --> 01:03:37,010
I'm gonna make sure I pee on all of this just to be sure.

1802
01:03:37,690 --> 01:03:38,970
I'm making it mine.

1803
01:03:39,430 --> 01:03:40,550
It's ours now.

1804
01:03:41,610 --> 01:03:43,130
How do I save my game?

1805
01:03:45,150 --> 01:03:46,650
There's so many questions.

1806
01:03:49,330 --> 01:03:49,770
Please.

1807
01:03:49,990 --> 01:03:50,270
Oh, wait.

1808
01:03:50,310 --> 01:03:51,130
There's a fox.

1809
01:03:51,350 --> 01:03:54,810
If I scare him, maybe he will lead me to his, like, burrow.

1810
01:03:55,110 --> 01:03:56,110
Oh, that's true.

1811
01:03:57,090 --> 01:03:59,030
Make him take us to his kids.

1812
01:04:00,930 --> 01:04:02,310
We don't have wolf kids.

1813
01:04:02,390 --> 01:04:03,610
We just have, like, fox kids.

1814
01:04:03,650 --> 01:04:04,790
He just adopted them.

1815
01:04:04,850 --> 01:04:06,350
He adopted the fox.

1816
01:04:06,430 --> 01:04:08,430
We will raise them to be a wolf.

1817
01:04:09,350 --> 01:04:09,790
Exactly.

1818
01:04:11,170 --> 01:04:11,970
Holy shit!

1819
01:04:11,970 --> 01:04:13,430
Look at all these trees!

1820
01:04:14,930 --> 01:04:15,870
He's so fast.

1821
01:04:15,890 --> 01:04:16,190
That's right.

1822
01:04:16,310 --> 01:04:16,930
Run home!

1823
01:04:17,010 --> 01:04:17,130
Run home!

1824
01:04:17,130 --> 01:04:18,530
He's so fucking fast.

1825
01:04:21,050 --> 01:04:23,070
Take us to your children!

1826
01:04:23,950 --> 01:04:24,850
Alright, here.

1827
01:04:24,910 --> 01:04:26,290
I'm gonna pee on this too, real fast.

1828
01:04:27,290 --> 01:04:30,950
This entire game is just us fighting trees.

1829
01:04:32,350 --> 01:04:33,290
It's just...

1830
01:04:35,270 --> 01:04:36,450
Oh my god.

1831
01:04:36,510 --> 01:04:38,630
It's a pee simulator.

1832
01:04:38,630 --> 01:04:40,030
It is, yeah!

1833
01:04:40,310 --> 01:04:41,470
Wait, okay.

1834
01:04:41,730 --> 01:04:42,350
How do I...

1835
01:04:42,350 --> 01:04:44,670
I'm gonna see if I can open the server.

1836
01:04:45,910 --> 01:04:47,190
How do I open...

1837
01:04:47,190 --> 01:04:50,330
We want babies!

1838
01:04:50,750 --> 01:04:53,110
We want to have puppies!

1839
01:04:53,410 --> 01:04:55,590
We want shrimp goons!

1840
01:04:56,930 --> 01:04:58,930
We need the shrimp goons!

1841
01:04:59,110 --> 01:05:01,050
How do I save this game?

1842
01:05:01,310 --> 01:05:01,830
Alright.

1843
01:05:04,830 --> 01:05:05,530
Okay.

1844
01:05:05,530 --> 01:05:05,770
Okay.

1845
01:05:07,070 --> 01:05:08,350
Oh, save game!

1846
01:05:08,570 --> 01:05:09,110
Okay.

1847
01:05:09,390 --> 01:05:11,290
I'm saving game.

1848
01:05:11,730 --> 01:05:12,510
Found it.

1849
01:05:13,030 --> 01:05:13,910
Okay, did I... Okay.

1850
01:05:14,410 --> 01:05:15,670
Shrimp goons.

1851
01:05:15,670 --> 01:05:16,190
Help us.

1852
01:05:16,450 --> 01:05:16,970
Help us.

1853
01:05:18,030 --> 01:05:19,010
Please, shrimp goons.

1854
01:05:19,490 --> 01:05:20,250
Okay, okay.

1855
01:05:20,410 --> 01:05:21,650
I'm gonna remake the lobby.

1856
01:05:22,550 --> 01:05:23,470
Help us.

1857
01:05:23,470 --> 01:05:24,230
We're so lost.

1858
01:05:24,490 --> 01:05:25,790
We're so lost.

1859
01:05:25,950 --> 01:05:26,330
Okay.

1860
01:05:26,510 --> 01:05:29,190
I'm gonna return to the main menu.

1861
01:05:29,290 --> 01:05:30,670
I'm gonna end the session.

1862
01:05:30,930 --> 01:05:31,550
Yes, yes.

1863
01:05:32,530 --> 01:05:33,670
Open it up.

1864
01:05:33,830 --> 01:05:35,190
We're gonna open it up.

1865
01:05:35,510 --> 01:05:37,350
Open the gates up!

1866
01:05:38,710 --> 01:05:40,210
Alright, shrimp goons!

1867
01:05:40,330 --> 01:05:41,070
Alright, alright.

1868
01:05:41,450 --> 01:05:42,770
Set up game.

1869
01:05:44,030 --> 01:05:44,650
100%.

1870
01:05:45,370 --> 01:05:46,630
It's public now!

1871
01:05:46,890 --> 01:05:49,890
We can have three shrimp goons in here!

1872
01:05:50,470 --> 01:05:51,170
Let's go!

1873
01:05:51,490 --> 01:05:52,190
Let's go!

1874
01:05:54,030 --> 01:05:54,650
Alright.

1875
01:05:54,790 --> 01:05:55,390
Okay.

1876
01:05:55,630 --> 01:05:57,490
I'll do no chat just in case.

1877
01:05:57,590 --> 01:05:57,830
Just...

1878
01:05:59,390 --> 01:06:01,130
Just to be safe.

1879
01:06:01,130 --> 01:06:01,410
Just to be safe.

1880
01:06:01,550 --> 01:06:02,590
Just to be safe.

1881
01:06:02,750 --> 01:06:03,450
Okay, okay, okay.

1882
01:06:03,790 --> 01:06:04,270
Okay.

1883
01:06:04,710 --> 01:06:06,930
Join, join before the shrimp goons get in first.

1884
01:06:07,390 --> 01:06:07,870
Join!

1885
01:06:07,870 --> 01:06:10,210
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

1886
01:06:10,210 --> 01:06:10,730
Shrimp goons!

1887
01:06:10,730 --> 01:06:11,210
Shrimp goons!

1888
01:06:11,370 --> 01:06:11,910
Join, join!

1889
01:06:12,050 --> 01:06:12,510
No, no!

1890
01:06:12,570 --> 01:06:13,110
Don't join!

1891
01:06:13,230 --> 01:06:13,750
Don't join!

1892
01:06:13,810 --> 01:06:14,730
I didn't create it yet!

1893
01:06:14,870 --> 01:06:15,610
Do not join!

1894
01:06:16,070 --> 01:06:16,890
I joined!

1895
01:06:17,250 --> 01:06:17,790
I joined!

1896
01:06:18,010 --> 01:06:19,510
Okay, okay, okay.

1897
01:06:20,210 --> 01:06:22,330
Alright, we're fine.

1898
01:06:22,870 --> 01:06:23,790
Wait, where are you?

1899
01:06:24,330 --> 01:06:24,810
Sasuke!

1900
01:06:24,910 --> 01:06:25,470
You're here!

1901
01:06:25,910 --> 01:06:26,390
Okay.

1902
01:06:26,710 --> 01:06:27,190
Yippee!

1903
01:06:28,290 --> 01:06:30,110
Alright, shrimp goons.

1904
01:06:30,230 --> 01:06:30,990
Oh my god!

1905
01:06:31,550 --> 01:06:33,170
There's already wolves here!

1906
01:06:34,230 --> 01:06:34,770
Yo!

1907
01:06:34,770 --> 01:06:35,370
Let's go!

1908
01:06:35,610 --> 01:06:36,470
Alright, teach us!

1909
01:06:36,710 --> 01:06:37,890
Teach us, MC!

1910
01:06:41,270 --> 01:06:42,350
Teach us!

1911
01:06:42,490 --> 01:06:43,270
Teach us!

1912
01:06:43,550 --> 01:06:43,610
Teach us!

1913
01:06:43,610 --> 01:06:44,010
Teach us!

1914
01:06:44,010 --> 01:06:44,010
Teach us!

1915
01:06:44,170 --> 01:06:45,450
How does this work?

1916
01:06:45,650 --> 01:06:48,130
My leg has been broken for a while.

1917
01:06:48,470 --> 01:06:48,530
My leg has been broken for a while.

1918
01:06:48,570 --> 01:06:49,770
How does this work?

1919
01:06:49,850 --> 01:06:50,810
Be submissive.

1920
01:06:50,810 --> 01:06:51,750
I am the alpha.

1921
01:06:51,930 --> 01:06:52,710
I don't know what I'm doing.

1922
01:06:53,130 --> 01:06:54,910
Be submissive on your knees.

1923
01:06:54,910 --> 01:06:55,390
Lie down!

1924
01:06:55,590 --> 01:06:56,050
Do it!

1925
01:06:56,170 --> 01:06:56,710
That's right!

1926
01:06:57,050 --> 01:06:57,910
Lie down!

1927
01:06:58,350 --> 01:06:59,670
And show me your belly!

1928
01:07:00,310 --> 01:07:01,410
Show me your belly!

1929
01:07:01,650 --> 01:07:02,850
Show me your belly!

1930
01:07:03,230 --> 01:07:04,890
Show us your belly!

1931
01:07:06,090 --> 01:07:06,230
Show us your belly!

1932
01:07:06,230 --> 01:07:09,490
Show us your belly!

1933
01:07:10,730 --> 01:07:11,630
Sniff my butt!

1934
01:07:11,730 --> 01:07:13,130
Go ahead, sniff my butt!

1935
01:07:13,250 --> 01:07:15,150
Where's the submissiveness here?

1936
01:07:15,510 --> 01:07:16,650
Where's the... what the heck?

1937
01:07:17,010 --> 01:07:18,830
Oh, that's freaking great!

1938
01:07:19,950 --> 01:07:20,670
That's right!

1939
01:07:20,910 --> 01:07:21,970
That's right!

1940
01:07:24,450 --> 01:07:24,990
Yeah!

1941
01:07:25,170 --> 01:07:25,710
Yeah!

1942
01:07:28,930 --> 01:07:30,570
We have our pack.

1943
01:07:30,870 --> 01:07:32,170
This is our pack now.

1944
01:07:32,390 --> 01:07:35,710
I am the alpha that teaches us how to play the game.

1945
01:07:36,390 --> 01:07:39,150
I am dirt and ditzy.

1946
01:07:39,270 --> 01:07:39,590
I am dirt and ditzy.

1947
01:07:39,590 --> 01:07:39,750
Let's go!

1948
01:07:40,390 --> 01:07:41,530
I am!

1949
01:07:42,410 --> 01:07:45,130
I know I disable chat, but like...

1950
01:07:45,130 --> 01:07:47,830
Show us how to play without talking.

1951
01:07:48,310 --> 01:07:48,870
Show us how to play without talking.

1952
01:07:51,490 --> 01:07:55,610
You may be peed on once you find us a beautiful home.

1953
01:07:55,690 --> 01:07:56,130
Yeah, yeah.

1954
01:07:57,730 --> 01:08:00,550
Let's pee on all of them to make sure they are territory.

1955
01:08:01,850 --> 01:08:02,910
I peed on them.

1956
01:08:03,230 --> 01:08:03,770
Yeah, yeah.

1957
01:08:03,810 --> 01:08:04,390
I peed on them.

1958
01:08:07,370 --> 01:08:08,870
First pee, and then pee.

1959
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:16,960
First pee, and then pee.

1960
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:17,520
So immersive!

1961
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:18,820
We're so immersive!

1962
01:08:19,420 --> 01:08:19,640
Woooo!

1963
01:08:22,460 --> 01:08:24,020
Now find us a home!

1964
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:26,980
We want a home right now.

1965
01:08:30,460 --> 01:08:32,040
Find us a home!

1966
01:08:32,280 --> 01:08:33,220
Okay, follow dirt!

1967
01:08:33,380 --> 01:08:34,380
He knows what to do!

1968
01:08:34,800 --> 01:08:36,500
He's running in the directions!

1969
01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:37,900
Dirt knows!

1970
01:08:38,860 --> 01:08:41,240
Look at that confidence throwing at him!

1971
01:08:41,560 --> 01:08:43,560
I know it!

1972
01:08:43,560 --> 01:08:48,060
That's when you know this guy has 50 hours on WolfQuest Anniversary Edition.

1973
01:08:48,740 --> 01:08:50,360
That's when you know!

1974
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:53,560
That's right!

1975
01:08:53,760 --> 01:08:54,000
Dirt knows!

1976
01:08:54,020 --> 01:08:55,740
Go, go, go, dirt!

1977
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:56,080
Go!

1978
01:08:57,800 --> 01:08:58,740
You got this!

1979
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:00,180
Yeah, you got this dirt!

1980
01:09:01,540 --> 01:09:03,480
Find a safe place to sleep!

1981
01:09:03,780 --> 01:09:04,780
We need puppies!

1982
01:09:05,400 --> 01:09:07,040
We need shrimp goons!

1983
01:09:07,060 --> 01:09:07,680
We need puppies!

1984
01:09:08,120 --> 01:09:12,840
When a shrimp and a dragoon like each other very, very much.

1985
01:09:15,660 --> 01:09:17,260
Wait, who's the bottom?

1986
01:09:17,380 --> 01:09:19,580
Is it the shrimps or the goons?

1987
01:09:20,380 --> 01:09:22,840
I mean, it's in the name, so...

1988
01:09:22,840 --> 01:09:24,000
I mean, it's in the name, so...

1989
01:09:26,600 --> 01:09:28,440
It couldn't be more obvious!

1990
01:09:28,860 --> 01:09:30,640
It couldn't be more obvious!

1991
01:09:30,700 --> 01:09:31,940
It couldn't be more obvious!

1992
01:09:31,940 --> 01:09:33,160
Dirt, where is our home?

1993
01:09:33,940 --> 01:09:35,460
Where is our home?

1994
01:09:36,700 --> 01:09:38,760
Okay, Ditsy is so far away.

1995
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,160
This person did not invest in speed.

1996
01:09:41,240 --> 01:09:41,380
This person did not invest in speed.

1997
01:09:41,380 --> 01:09:42,160
That's for sure.

1998
01:09:42,660 --> 01:09:44,220
They are not speedy.

1999
01:09:44,540 --> 01:09:46,260
They are not speedy at all.

2000
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:47,980
I feel like...

2001
01:09:47,980 --> 01:09:52,500
You know, it would be fucked up if Dirt actually doesn't know what we're doing and he's just running...

2002
01:09:52,500 --> 01:09:54,280
He's just tagging along.

2003
01:09:54,580 --> 01:09:57,440
He's like, why are you guys following me?

2004
01:09:58,300 --> 01:10:00,620
Don't worry, he must know what he's doing!

2005
01:10:01,180 --> 01:10:02,980
Oh damn, Fang got a kill!

2006
01:10:03,180 --> 01:10:03,720
Okay, okay!

2007
01:10:04,180 --> 01:10:06,020
He's just going for it!

2008
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:07,840
Go, Wolf!

2009
01:10:08,160 --> 01:10:09,260
Go, Wolf, go!

2010
01:10:10,580 --> 01:10:11,540
Oh, I'm following Dirt.

2011
01:10:11,780 --> 01:10:13,840
You've gone far too long without sleeping.

2012
01:10:14,020 --> 01:10:15,580
Oh shit, guys, I'm gonna sleep.

2013
01:10:15,740 --> 01:10:16,640
I'm EP too.

2014
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:17,540
I'm EP too.

2015
01:10:21,220 --> 01:10:22,280
Body heat!

2016
01:10:22,700 --> 01:10:24,400
Grab me the body heat!

2017
01:10:26,240 --> 01:10:27,120
Me, me, me, me...

2018
01:10:27,120 --> 01:10:28,720
Look at all these...

2019
01:10:28,720 --> 01:10:31,660
Everybody just stops on the tracks to sleep.

2020
01:10:33,060 --> 01:10:34,560
Just... come sleep!

2021
01:10:34,920 --> 01:10:35,380
Sleep!

2022
01:10:35,700 --> 01:10:37,940
Guys, the sun is still up, why are you guys not sleeping?

2023
01:10:38,700 --> 01:10:40,260
The sun is up, what the heck?

2024
01:10:40,260 --> 01:10:40,720
Go sleep!

2025
01:10:41,160 --> 01:10:44,320
The alpha says sleep!

2026
01:10:44,960 --> 01:10:46,340
It's the middle of the day!

2027
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:46,960
What the heck?

2028
01:10:47,020 --> 01:10:47,980
Go E.P.

2029
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:48,820
Go sleep!

2030
01:10:49,040 --> 01:10:49,920
What are you doing?

2031
01:10:50,580 --> 01:10:52,540
I'll kick you out if you don't sleep.

2032
01:10:54,580 --> 01:10:55,640
That was quick!

2033
01:10:58,410 --> 01:10:59,320
Sleep or kick.

2034
01:11:00,500 --> 01:11:01,700
Sleep or kick.

2035
01:11:02,400 --> 01:11:03,160
I shall sleep.

2036
01:11:08,420 --> 01:11:13,080
And then listen real quick.

2037
01:11:13,080 --> 01:11:14,680
There we go.

2038
01:11:14,900 --> 01:11:15,820
There we go.

2039
01:11:16,060 --> 01:11:17,420
Oh shit, is that food for me?

2040
01:11:17,920 --> 01:11:18,680
That's right.

2041
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:19,800
Feed the alpha.

2042
01:11:20,720 --> 01:11:23,320
Fan, put that food down right now.

2043
01:11:25,860 --> 01:11:27,400
Put that food down.

2044
01:11:27,620 --> 01:11:28,260
Right now.

2045
01:11:29,540 --> 01:11:30,380
I'm hungry.

2046
01:11:31,040 --> 01:11:31,820
He just shook his head.

2047
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:32,480
No way!

2048
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:33,840
Oh my god!

2049
01:11:34,180 --> 01:11:35,180
You bitch!

2050
01:11:36,260 --> 01:11:37,760
I can replace you.

2051
01:11:38,340 --> 01:11:40,540
How do I express myself?

2052
01:11:40,840 --> 01:11:41,400
Snarl.

2053
01:11:41,620 --> 01:11:42,520
Yeah, yeah, snarl.

2054
01:11:45,620 --> 01:11:46,880
Feed or kick.

2055
01:11:48,040 --> 01:11:49,260
Feed or kick.

2056
01:11:49,260 --> 01:11:49,260
Feed or kick.

2057
01:11:50,060 --> 01:11:50,860
Airplane ears?

2058
01:11:50,980 --> 01:11:52,400
Wait, my ears are already airplane.

2059
01:11:53,180 --> 01:11:55,160
How do I un-airplane my ears?

2060
01:11:55,240 --> 01:11:56,580
You were born like that.

2061
01:11:56,920 --> 01:12:00,120
I was born... I'm a natural airplane-er.

2062
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:01,820
Wait, what happened to dirt?

2063
01:12:02,820 --> 01:12:03,940
Yeah, wait, where's dirt?

2064
01:12:04,200 --> 01:12:05,120
Where the fuck is dirt?

2065
01:12:06,220 --> 01:12:09,860
Oh my god, dirt is the one that knows where the fucking holes are.

2066
01:12:11,260 --> 01:12:12,560
Dirt, where are you?

2067
01:12:13,240 --> 01:12:15,200
He has the whole location.

2068
01:12:16,980 --> 01:12:18,400
No, dirt, come on.

2069
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:18,980
No, where's dirt?

2070
01:12:20,420 --> 01:12:21,600
Wait, where is dirt?

2071
01:12:21,880 --> 01:12:23,020
Oh, dirt found a home!

2072
01:12:24,480 --> 01:12:25,600
Wait, for real?

2073
01:12:25,740 --> 01:12:27,300
Yeah, he found a home!

2074
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:28,780
Where are you?

2075
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:29,500
Yo!

2076
01:12:30,060 --> 01:12:30,860
I'm coming, I'm coming.

2077
01:12:31,040 --> 01:12:32,200
I'm behind you, I'm behind you.

2078
01:12:32,260 --> 01:12:33,200
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

2079
01:12:34,360 --> 01:12:35,120
Dirt found it.

2080
01:12:35,200 --> 01:12:35,800
It's like straight down.

2081
01:12:36,740 --> 01:12:37,800
Dirt tower, bang!

2082
01:12:40,180 --> 01:12:41,800
That's your fang and MC.

2083
01:12:41,800 --> 01:12:42,220
I see it.

2084
01:12:42,300 --> 01:12:43,920
You guys could never live up to dirt.

2085
01:12:46,420 --> 01:12:47,400
Dirt MVP.

2086
01:12:47,900 --> 01:12:48,920
Dirt MVP.

2087
01:12:48,940 --> 01:12:50,040
You guys could never.

2088
01:12:50,340 --> 01:12:53,780
Yeah, you guys could never live up to the expectations we have now.

2089
01:12:55,540 --> 01:12:58,300
Dirt has such bars, you wouldn't comprehend.

2090
01:12:58,640 --> 01:13:00,100
Yeah, you wouldn't comprehend.

2091
01:13:00,100 --> 01:13:01,560
This is the standard now.

2092
01:13:04,380 --> 01:13:06,360
This is our proud child.

2093
01:13:06,780 --> 01:13:06,800
This is...

2094
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:06,800
whoa!

2095
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:08,320
Oh my god, this is it!

2096
01:13:08,320 --> 01:13:09,660
This is... you know what?

2097
01:13:09,660 --> 01:13:10,240
That's a hole?

2098
01:13:11,500 --> 01:13:12,840
How do we get in?

2099
01:13:13,080 --> 01:13:15,180
How do we... dirt, you know what?

2100
01:13:15,360 --> 01:13:15,640
Dirt.

2101
01:13:15,980 --> 01:13:18,160
That's what I expected from a collared wolf.

2102
01:13:20,360 --> 01:13:24,240
From a collared wolf.

2103
01:13:24,260 --> 01:13:26,320
From a fucking collared wolf.

2104
01:13:29,540 --> 01:13:31,500
You're just never meant to be wild.

2105
01:13:32,900 --> 01:13:34,060
That's the king, right?

2106
01:13:34,120 --> 01:13:35,280
Show me your belly.

2107
01:13:37,300 --> 01:13:38,540
How do I make it mine?

2108
01:13:38,620 --> 01:13:39,360
Do I pee on it?

2109
01:13:40,460 --> 01:13:41,520
You're gonna pee on it?

2110
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:41,820
Okay.

2111
01:13:41,980 --> 01:13:42,860
Me too, I should.

2112
01:13:43,040 --> 01:13:44,180
Pee on the house to make it nice.

2113
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:48,460
You're just not like us.

2114
01:13:48,600 --> 01:13:50,480
You're not savage enough like us.

2115
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:53,160
Wait, did you just eat the...

2116
01:13:56,940 --> 01:13:58,440
I ate the whole thing!

2117
01:13:58,500 --> 01:13:59,120
What the heck?

2118
01:14:00,600 --> 01:14:02,180
I guess I was hungry or shit.

2119
01:14:02,180 --> 01:14:02,720
Holy shit, you were hungry.

2120
01:14:03,040 --> 01:14:03,880
Holy shit.

2121
01:14:04,140 --> 01:14:05,260
So how do we...

2122
01:14:05,260 --> 01:14:07,500
Let me look at the map real fast.

2123
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:08,440
Is that our den?

2124
01:14:09,540 --> 01:14:10,080
Is this ours?

2125
01:14:10,460 --> 01:14:11,140
Show all the...

2126
01:14:11,140 --> 01:14:11,720
Yeah, it is!

2127
01:14:11,720 --> 01:14:12,300
It's ours!

2128
01:14:12,820 --> 01:14:13,880
Is it ours?

2129
01:14:13,960 --> 01:14:15,740
Make this our territory, guys.

2130
01:14:15,800 --> 01:14:16,340
Start peeing.

2131
01:14:16,660 --> 01:14:18,300
Start peeing around the trees.

2132
01:14:18,840 --> 01:14:19,440
Sorry.

2133
01:14:21,080 --> 01:14:22,280
Wolf slay!

2134
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:24,000
Peek everywhere.

2135
01:14:24,320 --> 01:14:26,260
That's because I said collared wolf.

2136
01:14:27,680 --> 01:14:29,260
Guys, wolves, please.

2137
01:14:29,320 --> 01:14:32,100
The wolf community, do not cancel me.

2138
01:14:32,260 --> 01:14:33,860
Do not cancel me.

2139
01:14:33,860 --> 01:14:35,340
On a collared...

2140
01:14:35,340 --> 01:14:38,840
I cannot believe Doki Bird makes one of these collared wolves.

2141
01:14:40,160 --> 01:14:42,720
She has no idea where this came from.

2142
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:46,840
Oh my god, I'm sorry.

2143
01:14:46,840 --> 01:14:48,420
She doesn't know the meaning behind it.

2144
01:14:48,540 --> 01:14:49,260
I'm sorry!

2145
01:14:49,640 --> 01:14:51,880
I'm just an uncolored wolf.

2146
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:52,720
I don't know.

2147
01:14:53,660 --> 01:14:55,280
Cut her some slack.

2148
01:14:55,340 --> 01:14:56,320
She doesn't know better.

2149
01:14:56,660 --> 01:14:58,400
I'm not wearing a collar.

2150
01:14:58,480 --> 01:14:59,080
I don't know.

2151
01:15:00,480 --> 01:15:01,300
It's ours.

2152
01:15:01,400 --> 01:15:01,800
We did it.

2153
01:15:01,920 --> 01:15:03,220
It belongs to us.

2154
01:15:03,300 --> 01:15:04,280
Is it belongs to us?

2155
01:15:04,380 --> 01:15:05,600
This is our home now?

2156
01:15:05,880 --> 01:15:07,640
It is belongs to us.

2157
01:15:07,740 --> 01:15:08,360
Oh my god.

2158
01:15:08,440 --> 01:15:08,820
All of us.

2159
01:15:08,840 --> 01:15:09,260
This is our home.

2160
01:15:09,720 --> 01:15:11,000
We did it.

2161
01:15:11,020 --> 01:15:12,240
We complete the quest.

2162
01:15:12,660 --> 01:15:13,860
We did it.

2163
01:15:15,140 --> 01:15:17,300
So how do we get pups?

2164
01:15:17,440 --> 01:15:18,300
Now four weeks.

2165
01:15:18,320 --> 01:15:19,560
Your pups are too big.

2166
01:15:19,780 --> 01:15:21,400
Okay guys, shrimp goons.

2167
01:15:21,480 --> 01:15:23,100
Shrimp goons come over here.

2168
01:15:23,640 --> 01:15:24,540
Shrimp goons.

2169
01:15:24,540 --> 01:15:24,900
Make pups.

2170
01:15:33,090 --> 01:15:34,010
Shrimp goons.

2171
01:15:34,210 --> 01:15:36,990
We have another request.

2172
01:15:37,610 --> 01:15:39,750
Now make the puppy.

2173
01:15:40,190 --> 01:15:41,190
Make a puppy.

2174
01:15:43,390 --> 01:15:44,890
Come here and make a puppy.

2175
01:15:45,110 --> 01:15:45,490
Come here and make a puppy.

2176
01:15:45,490 --> 01:15:47,230
Make a puppy for us to see.

2177
01:15:48,190 --> 01:15:49,050
Wait, who is this?

2178
01:15:49,350 --> 01:15:50,810
Wait, he doesn't have a name anymore.

2179
01:15:51,810 --> 01:15:52,570
Who is this wolf?

2180
01:15:52,930 --> 01:15:54,870
Wait, you have a name?

2181
01:15:55,190 --> 01:15:56,190
Yeah, it's Ditsy.

2182
01:15:56,450 --> 01:15:58,070
Oh, I accidentally pressed N.

2183
01:15:58,190 --> 01:16:00,690
I pressed N and it's gone.

2184
01:16:01,490 --> 01:16:02,210
Immersion mode.

2185
01:16:02,330 --> 01:16:03,890
Oh my god, it makes me so immersed.

2186
01:16:04,730 --> 01:16:06,490
Let me look at the controls.

2187
01:16:06,790 --> 01:16:08,330
Let me look at the controls.

2188
01:16:09,430 --> 01:16:10,250
Let's see.

2189
01:16:10,310 --> 01:16:11,990
How do we make a puppy?

2190
01:16:12,130 --> 01:16:14,330
How do we make the puppies?

2191
01:16:16,930 --> 01:16:20,590
I thought when we put two puppies together it would just work.

2192
01:16:21,090 --> 01:16:22,670
Is there more to that?

2193
01:16:22,770 --> 01:16:23,190
Done.

2194
01:16:23,550 --> 01:16:28,530
Is there more to that than we expected?

2195
01:16:28,730 --> 01:16:29,470
What the heck?

2196
01:16:29,490 --> 01:16:31,330
This isn't everything?

2197
01:16:31,710 --> 01:16:32,950
That's not it?

2198
01:16:33,110 --> 01:16:33,650
There's more?

2199
01:16:33,790 --> 01:16:34,170
Yeah.

2200
01:16:39,110 --> 01:16:39,750
There's more.

2201
01:16:39,750 --> 01:16:41,190
What do you mean this isn't everything?

2202
01:16:41,550 --> 01:16:43,590
I can't believe you guys don't have bios.

2203
01:16:43,670 --> 01:16:45,330
How are we supposed to know your story?

2204
01:16:47,610 --> 01:16:48,530
Where's your bio?

2205
01:16:48,630 --> 01:16:48,830
What's that?

2206
01:16:48,830 --> 01:16:49,510
Where's your bio?

2207
01:16:49,750 --> 01:16:50,650
I'm reading it.

2208
01:16:50,690 --> 01:16:55,750
Only Sasuke and Doki Wolf FPS VTuber has a bio.

2209
01:16:56,910 --> 01:16:57,790
Only Sasuke and Doki Wolf FPS VTuber has a bio.

2210
01:16:57,790 --> 01:16:59,210
Why is there no bio?

2211
01:16:59,750 --> 01:17:01,370
You don't take this game seriously.

2212
01:17:01,450 --> 01:17:02,570
Yeah, you guys don't take this.

2213
01:17:02,590 --> 01:17:03,590
You're not as immersed as us.

2214
01:17:04,170 --> 01:17:04,830
Give us...

2215
01:17:05,350 --> 01:17:06,110
PMR things.

2216
01:17:06,250 --> 01:17:07,290
We need more hexes.

2217
01:17:08,810 --> 01:17:11,370
Sasuke and I are just gonna have these assets on while you guys pee.

2218
01:17:13,650 --> 01:17:16,470
Just keep peeing while we chat.

2219
01:17:16,770 --> 01:17:18,930
While we chat next to our home?

2220
01:17:21,830 --> 01:17:22,590
Failed RP.

2221
01:17:23,050 --> 01:17:23,990
Go pee!

2222
01:17:25,450 --> 01:17:26,530
We peed it up.

2223
01:17:27,030 --> 01:17:27,990
Breeding in bio.

2224
01:17:30,290 --> 01:17:31,550
I'm ready to make puppies.

2225
01:17:33,350 --> 01:17:33,990
It's okay.

2226
01:17:34,170 --> 01:17:36,390
I'm ready for puppies.

2227
01:17:36,450 --> 01:17:38,350
I feel like I've matured enough.

2228
01:17:41,690 --> 01:17:43,470
We've like outsourced it.

2229
01:17:44,270 --> 01:17:46,130
Yo, I love my food!

2230
01:17:46,290 --> 01:17:47,350
Put that down!

2231
01:17:47,430 --> 01:17:47,890
I'm hungry!

2232
01:17:48,130 --> 01:17:49,450
Your alpha is hungry.

2233
01:17:49,690 --> 01:17:50,150
That's right.

2234
01:17:54,050 --> 01:17:54,730
That's right.

2235
01:17:55,050 --> 01:17:56,650
Show me your belly thing.

2236
01:17:56,790 --> 01:17:57,570
Come back!

2237
01:17:59,610 --> 01:18:00,330
Belly diet.

2238
01:18:01,010 --> 01:18:02,390
Show me your belly.

2239
01:18:04,670 --> 01:18:06,990
How do I make my tail go up?

2240
01:18:06,990 --> 01:18:08,330
Wait, that looks so goofy.

2241
01:18:08,450 --> 01:18:09,930
Oh, wait, what the fuck?

2242
01:18:10,230 --> 01:18:11,490
What the fuck?

2243
01:18:11,550 --> 01:18:13,210
That looks so fucked up.

2244
01:18:14,070 --> 01:18:17,470
It's my antenna so it can't see me.

2245
01:18:17,530 --> 01:18:18,350
Oh my god.

2246
01:18:20,650 --> 01:18:22,610
It looks so stupid.

2247
01:18:23,950 --> 01:18:26,070
I like how we're like...

2248
01:18:26,070 --> 01:18:28,350
We like outsource the help now.

2249
01:18:28,390 --> 01:18:30,150
We don't even do it.

2250
01:18:30,150 --> 01:18:30,310
We don't even do it.

2251
01:18:31,330 --> 01:18:34,450
This is the goal of being a streamer.

2252
01:18:35,270 --> 01:18:37,130
Yeah, like we get food now.

2253
01:18:37,230 --> 01:18:38,330
We have a home.

2254
01:18:38,410 --> 01:18:38,990
We get food.

2255
01:18:39,070 --> 01:18:39,670
We get territory.

2256
01:18:40,350 --> 01:18:42,030
Yeah, and then all we have to do...

2257
01:18:42,030 --> 01:18:42,950
Look, we can't get another piece.

2258
01:18:43,450 --> 01:18:45,370
They got us another hexagon?

2259
01:18:46,190 --> 01:18:46,570
Yes!

2260
01:18:46,570 --> 01:18:47,930
We have the bottom one.

2261
01:18:48,170 --> 01:18:49,310
Oh my god.

2262
01:18:50,010 --> 01:18:51,210
Ditsy, what are you doing?

2263
01:18:51,230 --> 01:18:52,530
Why are you still in this hexagon?

2264
01:18:52,870 --> 01:18:54,510
Leave this hexagon and go pee.

2265
01:18:56,430 --> 01:18:57,370
Go pee.

2266
01:18:57,370 --> 01:18:59,770
We need more hexagons.

2267
01:18:59,770 --> 01:19:00,310
More places.

2268
01:19:00,310 --> 01:19:00,310
Go pee.

2269
01:19:00,570 --> 01:19:01,890
We need like...

2270
01:19:03,310 --> 01:19:04,910
8 out of 15.

2271
01:19:05,070 --> 01:19:06,310
I can't do quick maths.

2272
01:19:07,990 --> 01:19:08,950
Quick maths.

2273
01:19:11,410 --> 01:19:13,430
We need 7 more hexagons.

2274
01:19:15,330 --> 01:19:16,150
Ditsy, leave.

2275
01:19:16,730 --> 01:19:17,650
What the heck?

2276
01:19:17,650 --> 01:19:18,230
It's in the quest.

2277
01:19:18,310 --> 01:19:19,630
If you press M...

2278
01:19:19,630 --> 01:19:19,970
Oh.

2279
01:19:20,150 --> 01:19:25,490
If you press M and you see establish your territory, it tells you how many hexagons you need.

2280
01:19:27,470 --> 01:19:28,110
Ah.

2281
01:19:29,510 --> 01:19:30,710
I see.

2282
01:19:31,210 --> 01:19:32,010
4 hexagons?

2283
01:19:32,910 --> 01:19:33,430
Come on.

2284
01:19:33,490 --> 01:19:33,830
Hop hop.

2285
01:19:33,950 --> 01:19:34,290
Hop hop.

2286
01:19:34,390 --> 01:19:34,890
We want more.

2287
01:19:35,670 --> 01:19:38,810
We gave you guys 4 hexagons already.

2288
01:19:38,910 --> 01:19:40,590
So it's up to you now.

2289
01:19:41,030 --> 01:19:42,690
You started with like 3.

2290
01:19:47,110 --> 01:19:53,190
We traveled to this area to have a future for all you shrimp goons.

2291
01:19:55,290 --> 01:19:56,930
We made this happen.

2292
01:19:57,370 --> 01:20:00,390
We made this happen for you shrimp goons.

2293
01:20:00,410 --> 01:20:01,530
You should be grateful.

2294
01:20:01,830 --> 01:20:02,070
Yeah.

2295
01:20:02,390 --> 01:20:07,430
Back in our day, we didn't even have hexagons to start off.

2296
01:20:09,470 --> 01:20:14,510
Back in my day, we had to pee multiple tons of water for one hexagon.

2297
01:20:15,140 --> 01:20:15,450
Yeah.

2298
01:20:15,490 --> 01:20:15,810
Yeah.

2299
01:20:16,450 --> 01:20:18,170
Nowadays you piss 2 trees.

2300
01:20:18,490 --> 01:20:18,950
Yeah.

2301
01:20:19,030 --> 01:20:21,970
Now you guys have it so easy.

2302
01:20:22,590 --> 01:20:24,270
It's so easy.

2303
01:20:24,890 --> 01:20:26,030
No one wolf.

2304
01:20:26,510 --> 01:20:28,090
We have to have a known wolf?

2305
01:20:28,470 --> 01:20:30,570
This wolf was known to you.

2306
01:20:30,710 --> 01:20:32,590
He's now known to us.

2307
01:20:32,810 --> 01:20:33,070
Okay.

2308
01:20:33,130 --> 01:20:35,350
How do we... Can you give him a nickname?

2309
01:20:35,890 --> 01:20:36,130
Alright.

2310
01:20:36,150 --> 01:20:36,910
What is his name?

2311
01:20:37,610 --> 01:20:38,730
He's like a...

2312
01:20:39,150 --> 01:20:40,290
He's from... How do I have nicknames?

2313
01:20:40,710 --> 01:20:41,230
1405.

2314
01:20:41,230 --> 01:20:44,690
Oh, you go to known wolves and then you type his name.

2315
01:20:45,290 --> 01:20:46,770
Oh, known wolves.

2316
01:20:47,090 --> 01:20:47,970
Why don't we name him?

2317
01:20:48,270 --> 01:20:50,170
Why don't we name 1405 wolf?

2318
01:20:53,590 --> 01:20:54,310
Let's see.

2319
01:20:54,450 --> 01:20:55,530
That's a good question.

2320
01:20:56,830 --> 01:20:57,350
That's a good question.

2321
01:20:58,710 --> 01:20:59,350
UTI.

2322
01:20:59,770 --> 01:21:00,210
What?

2323
01:21:02,510 --> 01:21:04,490
Why did it actually change?

2324
01:21:06,110 --> 01:21:07,610
Where did I see it?

2325
01:21:08,490 --> 01:21:10,130
Oh my gosh.

2326
01:21:10,130 --> 01:21:10,650
It's global.

2327
01:21:10,750 --> 01:21:11,650
No way.

2328
01:21:12,150 --> 01:21:12,470
No!

2329
01:21:13,130 --> 01:21:14,090
Oh no!

2330
01:21:19,600 --> 01:21:20,240
Alright.

2331
01:21:21,300 --> 01:21:22,360
This one...

2332
01:21:22,360 --> 01:21:23,540
We have two more to name.

2333
01:21:23,660 --> 01:21:25,840
I need to remember to see other puppies.

2334
01:21:26,660 --> 01:21:27,880
And then... Oh wait.

2335
01:21:27,900 --> 01:21:28,240
That's it.

2336
01:21:28,420 --> 01:21:28,660
Wait.

2337
01:21:28,740 --> 01:21:30,020
Is it... Oh wait.

2338
01:21:30,080 --> 01:21:30,780
That's the male.

2339
01:21:31,180 --> 01:21:31,760
That's the male.

2340
01:21:32,040 --> 01:21:32,300
Okay.

2341
01:21:32,720 --> 01:21:34,420
Oh, M is male.

2342
01:21:34,480 --> 01:21:35,300
M is male.

2343
01:21:35,460 --> 01:21:35,780
Okay.

2344
01:21:35,800 --> 01:21:36,060
Okay.

2345
01:21:36,080 --> 01:21:36,440
Okay.

2346
01:21:38,060 --> 01:21:38,700
Let's see.

2347
01:21:40,180 --> 01:21:42,860
Take back for puppies.

2348
01:21:43,360 --> 01:21:44,180
There you go.

2349
01:21:45,400 --> 01:21:45,920
Alright.

2350
01:21:46,780 --> 01:21:48,220
We gotta get that one.

2351
01:21:49,080 --> 01:21:49,780
Take back for puppies.

2352
01:21:50,160 --> 01:21:51,860
We gotta get that one.

2353
01:21:51,980 --> 01:21:54,700
We gotta claim this one.

2354
01:21:56,180 --> 01:21:56,700
Alright.

2355
01:21:56,740 --> 01:21:57,120
Here we go.

2356
01:21:58,740 --> 01:21:58,880
Do it one more time.

2357
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:00,260
We gotta get that...

2358
01:22:00,260 --> 01:22:00,860
Guys!

2359
01:22:01,360 --> 01:22:03,280
Bring that wolf to us.

2360
01:22:03,580 --> 01:22:05,920
We request that wolf.

2361
01:22:07,600 --> 01:22:09,220
Not the UTI one.

2362
01:22:10,160 --> 01:22:11,740
Not the UTI, the puppy.

2363
01:22:11,740 --> 01:22:12,660
Not the UTI wolf.

2364
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:14,160
Not the UTI wolf.

2365
01:22:14,420 --> 01:22:17,440
We wanna take that wolf's puppies.

2366
01:22:19,060 --> 01:22:21,320
We wanna take that wolf's puppies.

2367
01:22:21,320 --> 01:22:21,560
Puppies!

2368
01:22:21,560 --> 01:22:22,620
Find her home!

2369
01:22:22,920 --> 01:22:24,380
And take her puppies!

2370
01:22:25,820 --> 01:22:26,760
That's all we want.

2371
01:22:27,080 --> 01:22:27,420
We just forced her over.

2372
01:22:27,540 --> 01:22:27,940
It's okay.

2373
01:22:28,060 --> 01:22:29,000
We just want a puppy!

2374
01:22:29,280 --> 01:22:30,200
We take care of it.

2375
01:22:30,300 --> 01:22:30,780
I promise!

2376
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:32,180
We just want... Yeah!

2377
01:22:32,180 --> 01:22:33,200
We're better parents!

2378
01:22:33,480 --> 01:22:34,400
We're better parents.

2379
01:22:34,560 --> 01:22:35,060
Look at this.

2380
01:22:35,260 --> 01:22:38,460
We can... We're such better parents.

2381
01:22:38,820 --> 01:22:40,660
We have an oil lamp!

2382
01:22:40,780 --> 01:22:41,360
Come on!

2383
01:22:41,360 --> 01:22:41,740
Yeah!

2384
01:22:41,740 --> 01:22:43,800
Do they have an oil lamp?

2385
01:22:44,040 --> 01:22:45,880
I don't fucking think so!

2386
01:22:46,080 --> 01:22:48,680
Take her puppy.

2387
01:22:48,760 --> 01:22:49,840
I need her... Take her puppy.

2388
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:50,820
Okay, guys, remember.

2389
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:52,580
We're taking this wolf's puppies.

2390
01:22:53,440 --> 01:22:54,420
That's all we want.

2391
01:22:54,440 --> 01:22:55,300
Get the puppy!

2392
01:22:55,740 --> 01:22:56,920
Have they claimed more territory?

2393
01:22:57,680 --> 01:22:58,820
Ditsy, what are you doing?

2394
01:22:59,140 --> 01:23:01,520
There's like two hexagons next to you!

2395
01:23:05,220 --> 01:23:05,720
What?

2396
01:23:06,180 --> 01:23:08,180
What are you doing, Ditsy?

2397
01:23:08,200 --> 01:23:08,740
Are you all peeing?

2398
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,200
You've been in that hexagon for so long!

2399
01:23:15,060 --> 01:23:17,200
Why can't you be more like dirt?

2400
01:23:17,980 --> 01:23:18,480
Visit.

2401
01:23:18,720 --> 01:23:19,660
I think Ditsy...

2402
01:23:19,840 --> 01:23:20,820
Let's go to Ditsy.

2403
01:23:20,820 --> 01:23:21,900
Ditsy needs some.

2404
01:23:22,860 --> 01:23:23,720
Are we going the right way?

2405
01:23:24,100 --> 01:23:26,500
I have no idea what the heck is Ditsy!

2406
01:23:27,520 --> 01:23:28,360
Okay, I'm looking.

2407
01:23:28,480 --> 01:23:29,260
Yeah, yeah, this way, this way.

2408
01:23:29,480 --> 01:23:30,440
Ditsy, I swear.

2409
01:23:30,780 --> 01:23:35,540
If we hit that hexagon before you make that hex the ours...

2410
01:23:35,540 --> 01:23:36,800
I swear...

2411
01:23:39,880 --> 01:23:41,980
We're gonna kick you out.

2412
01:23:42,500 --> 01:23:45,160
There's gonna be consequences, young man.

2413
01:23:45,180 --> 01:23:47,160
There's gonna be consequences for your action.

2414
01:23:47,540 --> 01:23:48,140
Oh, wait.

2415
01:23:48,160 --> 01:23:48,720
I need to sleep.

2416
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:49,480
Goodnight.

2417
01:23:49,480 --> 01:23:50,320
Oh shit, me too.

2418
01:23:50,360 --> 01:23:50,700
Goodnight.

2419
01:23:51,900 --> 01:23:53,420
No, don't leave me alone!

2420
01:23:54,040 --> 01:23:54,480
Goodnight.

2421
01:23:54,660 --> 01:23:55,220
Okay, wait.

2422
01:23:55,800 --> 01:23:56,940
I forgot to sleep.

2423
01:23:57,020 --> 01:23:58,800
What was the button again?

2424
01:23:59,220 --> 01:23:59,660
Zed.

2425
01:23:59,720 --> 01:24:00,160
Zed?

2426
01:24:00,260 --> 01:24:00,460
Okay.

2427
01:24:00,740 --> 01:24:01,180
Sleep!

2428
01:24:01,380 --> 01:24:02,200
Everybody sleep!

2429
01:24:07,380 --> 01:24:07,820
Wow!

2430
01:24:07,820 --> 01:24:08,400
Who's that?

2431
01:24:09,280 --> 01:24:11,520
Who's that that popped up next to us?

2432
01:24:12,600 --> 01:24:13,220
Wait, what?

2433
01:24:13,460 --> 01:24:15,520
Somebody popped up next to us.

2434
01:24:15,560 --> 01:24:16,260
Who the fuck is that?

2435
01:24:16,260 --> 01:24:17,200
I don't have one.

2436
01:24:17,240 --> 01:24:19,000
Wait, do you have like a ghost ball or something?

2437
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:20,820
Ghost ball that showed up.

2438
01:24:21,720 --> 01:24:22,440
Holy shit.

2439
01:24:22,500 --> 01:24:23,580
Hello there, mother.

2440
01:24:24,040 --> 01:24:24,400
Mother.

2441
01:24:24,820 --> 01:24:25,280
Nourish me.

2442
01:24:25,940 --> 01:24:26,740
Me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me.

2443
01:24:26,740 --> 01:24:27,520
Nourish me, mother.

2444
01:24:28,900 --> 01:24:32,500
Me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me.

2445
01:24:33,160 --> 01:24:34,000
Someone's not sleeping.

2446
01:24:34,260 --> 01:24:35,320
Who is not sleeping?

2447
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:38,120
There will be consequences.

2448
01:24:38,920 --> 01:24:39,800
Who's not sleeping.

2449
01:24:39,800 --> 01:24:42,020
You think I won't know if you're not sleeping or not?

2450
01:24:42,460 --> 01:24:43,780
I- I- I will...

2451
01:24:43,780 --> 01:24:45,440
Don't make me pull up the mat.

2452
01:24:45,620 --> 01:24:46,040
We will find out.

2453
01:24:46,040 --> 01:24:46,540
We will find out.

2454
01:24:46,780 --> 01:24:47,460
We have spies everywhere.

2455
01:24:47,460 --> 01:24:50,640
Oh my god, now the day is going down!

2456
01:24:51,700 --> 01:24:52,180
Yippee!

2457
01:24:57,240 --> 01:24:59,620
What a beautiful night sky.

2458
01:24:59,860 --> 01:25:00,300
Gone.

2459
01:25:00,860 --> 01:25:01,800
Is that Ditzy?

2460
01:25:01,940 --> 01:25:02,760
Oh, Ditzy is here.

2461
01:25:03,040 --> 01:25:04,520
Oh, my leg is healed!

2462
01:25:04,680 --> 01:25:05,980
Okay, that was Ditzy next to us.

2463
01:25:06,340 --> 01:25:06,820
Ditzy.

2464
01:25:07,160 --> 01:25:09,240
You didn't claim that other hexagon!

2465
01:25:09,320 --> 01:25:10,820
You're running away?!

2466
01:25:13,200 --> 01:25:14,420
How dare you!

2467
01:25:14,420 --> 01:25:15,440
How dare you!

2468
01:25:15,540 --> 01:25:18,060
You wake up and you just run?!

2469
01:25:18,060 --> 01:25:20,040
You have a trail!

2470
01:25:20,260 --> 01:25:21,600
We can find you!

2471
01:25:23,720 --> 01:25:26,400
I can smell you from a mile away.

2472
01:25:26,480 --> 01:25:28,880
We're gonna supervise your work now, Ditzy.

2473
01:25:29,920 --> 01:25:32,520
We can't judge like... yes, okay.

2474
01:25:33,100 --> 01:25:34,720
Nice arc on that stream.

2475
01:25:34,980 --> 01:25:35,480
Yes, yes.

2476
01:25:38,280 --> 01:25:41,280
Alright, we're gonna... Alright, Ditzy, we're gonna be your supervisors.

2477
01:25:42,380 --> 01:25:43,680
Ditzy, I swear to god.

2478
01:25:43,720 --> 01:25:44,400
If we get the hexagon, we're gonna be your supervisors.

2479
01:25:44,420 --> 01:25:45,040
You're gonna be here and you're not peeing.

2480
01:25:45,500 --> 01:25:46,280
Okay, nice.

2481
01:25:46,400 --> 01:25:46,800
Good pee.

2482
01:25:47,740 --> 01:25:48,480
Ditzy, stop!

2483
01:25:48,680 --> 01:25:49,940
Ditzy, stop right now!

2484
01:25:50,980 --> 01:25:52,980
Ditzy, stop right now, Ditzy!

2485
01:25:53,140 --> 01:25:54,540
Your supervisors are here.

2486
01:25:54,980 --> 01:25:55,800
Okay, nice.

2487
01:25:56,060 --> 01:25:57,080
Alright, Ditzy, come over here.

2488
01:25:57,300 --> 01:25:57,860
This tree.

2489
01:25:58,280 --> 01:25:59,300
This tree right here.

2490
01:25:59,680 --> 01:26:00,500
Ditzy, get back!

2491
01:26:01,340 --> 01:26:01,780
Wow.

2492
01:26:02,460 --> 01:26:03,160
Minus points?

2493
01:26:03,200 --> 01:26:04,340
Minus points right there?

2494
01:26:04,400 --> 01:26:05,700
Yeah, minus points right there.

2495
01:26:05,880 --> 01:26:07,820
I feel like we can... we can...

2496
01:26:07,820 --> 01:26:11,640
We can get another shrimp goon here whenever we want, Ditzy.

2497
01:26:11,640 --> 01:26:14,440
So, prove your worth and pee on this tree right now.

2498
01:26:15,060 --> 01:26:15,700
Pee on it.

2499
01:26:15,900 --> 01:26:16,560
Right now.

2500
01:26:16,640 --> 01:26:17,280
Pee on it.

2501
01:26:17,440 --> 01:26:18,100
Pee on it.

2502
01:26:18,120 --> 01:26:18,580
Oh, hey, food.

2503
01:26:19,980 --> 01:26:21,100
Nom, nom, nom, nom.

2504
01:26:21,200 --> 01:26:22,540
You can have it.

2505
01:26:22,960 --> 01:26:24,220
Nom, nom, nom, nom, nom.

2506
01:26:24,320 --> 01:26:24,600
Nice.

2507
01:26:25,160 --> 01:26:25,520
Alright.

2508
01:26:25,880 --> 01:26:26,240
Nice.

2509
01:26:26,440 --> 01:26:26,800
Nice.

2510
01:26:26,800 --> 01:26:28,140
Good job, Ditzy.

2511
01:26:28,280 --> 01:26:30,020
Alright, that's like a... Decent form.

2512
01:26:30,240 --> 01:26:30,420
Decent form, yeah.

2513
01:26:30,480 --> 01:26:33,640
Decent form, but like, honestly, you have to raise your leg like this, okay?

2514
01:26:33,680 --> 01:26:35,060
Ditzy, like, remember.

2515
01:26:35,280 --> 01:26:37,080
This is how you actually pee on... Like this, Ditzy.

2516
01:26:37,240 --> 01:26:37,840
Yeah, like this.

2517
01:26:37,900 --> 01:26:37,940
Like this.

2518
01:26:38,180 --> 01:26:38,940
Yeah, like...

2519
01:26:43,580 --> 01:26:44,640
That's right.

2520
01:26:44,680 --> 01:26:45,580
Show them how it's done.

2521
01:26:46,020 --> 01:26:46,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2522
01:26:47,760 --> 01:26:49,800
We're the professionals here.

2523
01:26:49,860 --> 01:26:51,620
We started this company.

2524
01:26:51,920 --> 01:26:53,220
This company.

2525
01:26:55,680 --> 01:26:58,500
Welcome to Shrimp Goon Incorporated.

2526
01:26:59,480 --> 01:27:01,260
Shrimp Gooning Inc.

2527
01:27:04,540 --> 01:27:07,720
This company was built from nothing.

2528
01:27:09,440 --> 01:27:10,120
Did you see?

2529
01:27:10,120 --> 01:27:10,880
You're peeing.

2530
01:27:10,900 --> 01:27:11,680
You're peeing on nothing.

2531
01:27:11,840 --> 01:27:13,280
You're just marking the empty...

2532
01:27:13,280 --> 01:27:14,600
Yeah, you have to pee on trees.

2533
01:27:15,060 --> 01:27:15,260
Oh, wait.

2534
01:27:15,300 --> 01:27:15,880
That's my food.

2535
01:27:16,760 --> 01:27:17,940
Nom, nom, nom, nom.

2536
01:27:20,760 --> 01:27:21,700
Good job, Fang.

2537
01:27:21,700 --> 01:27:22,140
Nice treat.

2538
01:27:22,340 --> 01:27:22,560
Nice treat.

2539
01:27:22,640 --> 01:27:23,940
Seven out of ten, I would say.

2540
01:27:24,160 --> 01:27:24,900
Wait, wait, wait.

2541
01:27:25,280 --> 01:27:26,940
The leg needs some work, but otherwise...

2542
01:27:27,800 --> 01:27:28,960
You're getting there, Ditzy.

2543
01:27:29,040 --> 01:27:29,500
You're getting there.

2544
01:27:29,880 --> 01:27:30,540
He's learning.

2545
01:27:30,680 --> 01:27:31,120
He's learning.

2546
01:27:31,240 --> 01:27:32,340
Nom, nom, nom, nom, nom, nom, nom.

2547
01:27:32,520 --> 01:27:36,000
I love our intern Fang who keeps feeding us food.

2548
01:27:36,360 --> 01:27:36,600
Yeah.

2549
01:27:37,700 --> 01:27:38,920
It's like an Uber ride.

2550
01:27:40,280 --> 01:27:41,700
He's like, Uber Eats here.

2551
01:27:42,600 --> 01:27:43,480
Uber Eats.

2552
01:27:43,480 --> 01:27:43,720
Uber Eats.

2553
01:27:43,720 --> 01:27:46,840
He's the one that brings the boss like an apple every day.

2554
01:27:47,060 --> 01:27:47,580
Yeah.

2555
01:27:48,660 --> 01:27:50,500
Ditzy, why can't you be more like...

2556
01:27:50,500 --> 01:27:50,960
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

2557
01:27:51,140 --> 01:27:51,960
Wolf fight.

2558
01:27:52,020 --> 01:27:52,560
Whoa, whoa.

2559
01:27:54,600 --> 01:27:55,600
It's UTI.

2560
01:27:56,400 --> 01:27:57,380
It's UTI.

2561
01:27:59,480 --> 01:28:00,280
Oh, shit.

2562
01:28:01,100 --> 01:28:01,960
Oh, my God.

2563
01:28:01,960 --> 01:28:02,920
They're killing Fang.

2564
01:28:02,940 --> 01:28:03,680
You must submit.

2565
01:28:04,100 --> 01:28:05,280
We gotta see.

2566
01:28:05,340 --> 01:28:05,760
You must submit.

2567
01:28:06,240 --> 01:28:07,500
Submit to us.

2568
01:28:07,720 --> 01:28:08,240
Submit.

2569
01:28:09,120 --> 01:28:10,160
UTI, submit.

2570
01:28:10,160 --> 01:28:11,180
Take our puppy.

2571
01:28:11,440 --> 01:28:12,220
We need to get...

2572
01:28:12,220 --> 01:28:12,620
Take our puppy.

2573
01:28:14,260 --> 01:28:14,820
Help.

2574
01:28:14,820 --> 01:28:15,740
My butt.

2575
01:28:16,240 --> 01:28:16,940
Don't worry.

2576
01:28:17,720 --> 01:28:19,680
There's more of us than them.

2577
01:28:21,360 --> 01:28:22,120
That's right.

2578
01:28:22,260 --> 01:28:23,040
That's right.

2579
01:28:23,280 --> 01:28:23,660
There's...

2580
01:28:23,660 --> 01:28:24,460
No, no, no.

2581
01:28:24,460 --> 01:28:25,960
Our three is bigger than their three.

2582
01:28:27,880 --> 01:28:29,060
I got this guy.

2583
01:28:30,300 --> 01:28:30,940
Don't worry.

2584
01:28:32,560 --> 01:28:33,120
Kill.

2585
01:28:34,040 --> 01:28:34,600
Kill.

2586
01:28:35,280 --> 01:28:35,840
Kill.

2587
01:28:36,140 --> 01:28:36,440
Kill.

2588
01:28:41,640 --> 01:28:44,240
Like you're just howling while we're trying to kill.

2589
01:28:46,100 --> 01:28:46,840
Don't mind me.

2590
01:28:47,120 --> 01:28:48,220
Don't mind me.

2591
01:28:48,280 --> 01:28:49,120
We're just howling.

2592
01:28:49,820 --> 01:28:52,320
UTI, get UTI and then we follow puppy.

2593
01:28:53,200 --> 01:28:54,100
We follow.

2594
01:28:54,200 --> 01:28:54,760
We need to get puppy.

2595
01:28:54,840 --> 01:28:55,720
We need to get a female.

2596
01:28:55,840 --> 01:28:56,500
We got you.

2597
01:28:56,560 --> 01:28:57,800
We need you to take her puppy.

2598
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:01,120
Take a puppy.

2599
01:29:01,700 --> 01:29:02,880
UTI, get over here.

2600
01:29:02,940 --> 01:29:03,260
UTI.

2601
01:29:03,820 --> 01:29:04,860
Get over here.

2602
01:29:04,960 --> 01:29:06,160
You can't run away forever.

2603
01:29:06,160 --> 01:29:08,440
Forever... I'm the alpha.

2604
01:29:09,620 --> 01:29:11,700
So I was like, don't get UTI.

2605
01:29:13,220 --> 01:29:16,840
Don't get a UTI, that would be bad.

2606
01:29:18,380 --> 01:29:20,400
How do I make puppy submit?

2607
01:29:20,760 --> 01:29:22,040
Come on puppy, submit!

2608
01:29:22,420 --> 01:29:23,280
Join our pack!

2609
01:29:24,080 --> 01:29:25,020
Join our pack!

2610
01:29:25,280 --> 01:29:26,060
Join our pack!

2611
01:29:26,780 --> 01:29:28,080
Rami's just running!

2612
01:29:28,900 --> 01:29:30,180
Come on, you can't...

2613
01:29:30,180 --> 01:29:30,580
Stop running, join us!

2614
01:29:30,660 --> 01:29:31,080
Join!

2615
01:29:31,920 --> 01:29:33,800
Show us where your puppies are!

2616
01:29:36,920 --> 01:29:38,140
Take our puppies!

2617
01:29:38,460 --> 01:29:39,500
Oh, I got him!

2618
01:29:39,680 --> 01:29:41,280
I got him, that's right, UTI.

2619
01:29:41,840 --> 01:29:43,820
No, no, he's still running!

2620
01:29:43,820 --> 01:29:44,760
I got UTI, yes!

2621
01:29:45,040 --> 01:29:47,520
No, I mean, not actually got UTI, but...

2622
01:29:51,900 --> 01:29:54,060
Not actually, but like almost.

2623
01:29:55,080 --> 01:29:57,940
Look, look, in any other way...

2624
01:29:57,940 --> 01:29:59,260
I can't see you chasing UTI!

2625
01:30:02,100 --> 01:30:03,340
Is our puppy injured?

2626
01:30:03,620 --> 01:30:03,980
Yes!

2627
01:30:04,700 --> 01:30:05,420
Yes, submit!

2628
01:30:05,620 --> 01:30:06,140
Submit!

2629
01:30:06,160 --> 01:30:07,040
Submit to us!

2630
01:30:09,080 --> 01:30:10,740
Submit, submit, my body language!

2631
01:30:10,780 --> 01:30:12,200
I have to be like...

2632
01:30:12,200 --> 01:30:13,280
I have to be like...

2633
01:30:13,280 --> 01:30:14,800
Voice, I have to be like...

2634
01:30:14,800 --> 01:30:15,340
UTI down!

2635
01:30:15,500 --> 01:30:15,920
Go home!

2636
01:30:16,500 --> 01:30:17,440
UTI down!

2637
01:30:19,200 --> 01:30:20,160
UTI down.

2638
01:30:20,520 --> 01:30:22,280
Oh my god, we have the territory now too!

2639
01:30:22,980 --> 01:30:24,260
Wait, wait, I need to start peeing.

2640
01:30:24,380 --> 01:30:24,980
Okay, okay.

2641
01:30:25,360 --> 01:30:27,260
We need... this has to be like full yards.

2642
01:30:29,140 --> 01:30:29,620
Nice.

2643
01:30:30,300 --> 01:30:30,780
Alright.

2644
01:30:32,240 --> 01:30:33,200
53%, nice.

2645
01:30:34,320 --> 01:30:35,880
Bring us to your puppies.

2646
01:30:35,880 --> 01:30:36,800
Bring us to your puppies.

2647
01:30:37,320 --> 01:30:38,080
Where's the puppy?

2648
01:30:38,080 --> 01:30:39,240
Bring us to your puppies.

2649
01:30:39,340 --> 01:30:39,860
Where's your puppy?

2650
01:30:41,180 --> 01:30:41,900
If you don't bring...

2651
01:30:41,900 --> 01:30:44,400
If you want your puppies to live, you bring us to them.

2652
01:30:45,780 --> 01:30:47,960
Wait, I thought they were supposed to live!

2653
01:30:48,340 --> 01:30:49,280
What do you mean?

2654
01:30:49,820 --> 01:30:53,940
I mean, if we kill her before she tells us where the puppies are, then we'll just die.

2655
01:30:54,340 --> 01:30:55,000
No, come on.

2656
01:30:55,680 --> 01:30:58,280
Bring us to your puppies or join our pack.

2657
01:30:59,480 --> 01:31:00,580
Join our pack.

2658
01:31:00,580 --> 01:31:01,460
Come on, join us.

2659
01:31:01,980 --> 01:31:03,660
No, we've reached the edge!

2660
01:31:04,120 --> 01:31:05,520
She's gonna get away!

2661
01:31:05,660 --> 01:31:05,860
No!

2662
01:31:05,860 --> 01:31:08,000
She actually made it...

2663
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:08,980
No way!

2664
01:31:09,200 --> 01:31:09,760
She made it back!

2665
01:31:10,380 --> 01:31:11,040
We got...

2666
01:31:11,040 --> 01:31:13,060
She has to come back sooner or later.

2667
01:31:13,260 --> 01:31:13,840
She'll...

2668
01:31:16,200 --> 01:31:17,960
Sooner or later, she will cross...

2669
01:31:17,960 --> 01:31:18,280
We're watching.

2670
01:31:18,600 --> 01:31:21,120
She will cross paths with us again.

2671
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:22,640
We will...

2672
01:31:22,640 --> 01:31:26,360
You cannot get away from us, the Shrimp Goons Incorporated.

2673
01:31:29,440 --> 01:31:30,800
Shrimp Gooning Inc.

2674
01:31:31,100 --> 01:31:31,840
Let's go.

2675
01:31:33,300 --> 01:31:35,500
Taking puppies since 1999.

2676
01:31:35,500 --> 01:31:35,840
Oh, my God.

2677
01:31:35,840 --> 01:31:35,980
1999.

2678
01:31:43,220 --> 01:31:44,300
You'll come back.

2679
01:31:44,300 --> 01:31:45,620
Get your puppies over!

2680
01:31:46,080 --> 01:31:48,100
You'll be back, don't worry.

2681
01:31:48,220 --> 01:31:48,460
You'll be back.

2682
01:31:48,820 --> 01:31:48,940
You'll be back.

2683
01:31:49,700 --> 01:31:52,520
We can wait forever at the edge!

2684
01:31:55,280 --> 01:31:57,720
Sooner or later, you'll have to leave the edge.

2685
01:31:58,920 --> 01:32:00,080
Your little territory!

2686
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:01,720
It's expanding!

2687
01:32:02,160 --> 01:32:03,240
Oh, my God, look at us go!

2688
01:32:04,740 --> 01:32:05,820
I see you.

2689
01:32:05,840 --> 01:32:07,020
How many do we need now?

2690
01:32:07,380 --> 01:32:08,360
We need...

2691
01:32:08,360 --> 01:32:09,320
Three more!

2692
01:32:09,400 --> 01:32:10,080
Three more guys!

2693
01:32:12,100 --> 01:32:12,720
Let's go!

2694
01:32:12,900 --> 01:32:13,280
Is it?

2695
01:32:14,020 --> 01:32:14,940
Go forth!

2696
01:32:15,380 --> 01:32:16,660
Give us that territory!

2697
01:32:16,820 --> 01:32:17,660
We need three more!

2698
01:32:18,760 --> 01:32:19,780
Keep peeing!

2699
01:32:20,600 --> 01:32:22,340
I see you at the edge!

2700
01:32:22,400 --> 01:32:23,520
Go to that blue one!

2701
01:32:23,720 --> 01:32:24,280
Right now!

2702
01:32:26,780 --> 01:32:28,600
Wait, did I just hear another wolf?

2703
01:32:28,960 --> 01:32:29,500
Did you?

2704
01:32:30,040 --> 01:32:30,560
Okay.

2705
01:32:30,760 --> 01:32:34,100
That was a wolf I can briefly unlike my compas.

2706
01:32:35,080 --> 01:32:37,180
Oh, maybe... do we see a known wolves?

2707
01:32:37,400 --> 01:32:38,260
No, we don't.

2708
01:32:38,420 --> 01:32:39,720
Oh my god, they're dead.

2709
01:32:40,300 --> 01:32:42,200
They're like... did you see that?

2710
01:32:42,420 --> 01:32:43,760
Click on known wolves!

2711
01:32:43,880 --> 01:32:44,360
Oh god!

2712
01:32:44,360 --> 01:32:45,360
They're just dead!

2713
01:32:45,680 --> 01:32:46,880
They're just dead!

2714
01:32:48,040 --> 01:32:48,880
Holy shit!

2715
01:32:49,040 --> 01:32:49,500
Oh my goodness!

2716
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:51,640
Look, that was on them.

2717
01:32:51,780 --> 01:32:52,920
They did that, not us.

2718
01:32:53,200 --> 01:32:54,900
They were in our... okay, Fing.

2719
01:32:54,900 --> 01:32:55,860
They made me do it!

2720
01:32:56,320 --> 01:32:58,600
Fing, I am giving you a new job.

2721
01:32:58,760 --> 01:33:00,160
I am delegating.

2722
01:33:00,260 --> 01:33:01,700
Go find us...

2723
01:33:04,060 --> 01:33:06,360
Fing, you cannot say no to this.

2724
01:33:06,520 --> 01:33:07,780
You cannot say...

2725
01:33:07,780 --> 01:33:10,660
By joining this server, you've signed the contract.

2726
01:33:11,900 --> 01:33:14,120
You knew what you were getting into.

2727
01:33:14,140 --> 01:33:15,580
Yeah, you knew what you were getting into.

2728
01:33:15,680 --> 01:33:18,020
Find us another den.

2729
01:33:18,580 --> 01:33:19,900
That is your job.

2730
01:33:19,980 --> 01:33:20,960
That is your purpose.

2731
01:33:21,040 --> 01:33:21,500
Now go.

2732
01:33:21,660 --> 01:33:22,920
We don't need Uber Eats anymore.

2733
01:33:23,200 --> 01:33:24,160
We're cutting costs.

2734
01:33:24,640 --> 01:33:25,800
We're cutting costs.

2735
01:33:25,800 --> 01:33:27,060
We're cutting...

2736
01:33:27,850 --> 01:33:28,740
It's den now.

2737
01:33:28,960 --> 01:33:30,200
It's den now.

2738
01:33:30,300 --> 01:33:31,900
We're delegating the job.

2739
01:33:32,340 --> 01:33:32,880
Go!

2740
01:33:32,880 --> 01:33:34,240
Go, Fing!

2741
01:33:34,560 --> 01:33:35,560
Find us more...

2742
01:33:35,560 --> 01:33:36,060
It's Uber rehoming.

2743
01:33:36,440 --> 01:33:38,020
Yeah, we don't need...

2744
01:33:38,020 --> 01:33:40,540
Look, we spent too much money on Uber Eats.

2745
01:33:43,520 --> 01:33:45,100
We have to cut down, man.

2746
01:33:45,260 --> 01:33:45,740
Yeah.

2747
01:33:45,840 --> 01:33:46,560
It's not cheap.

2748
01:33:46,900 --> 01:33:52,520
Yeah, Uber Eats has realized that, like, we've been paying, like, 30% tip each time.

2749
01:33:52,640 --> 01:33:53,780
We gotta cut down.

2750
01:33:56,360 --> 01:33:58,600
They were like, yeah, nah, I don't know if it's profitable.

2751
01:33:59,740 --> 01:34:00,540
Yeah, maybe...

2752
01:34:00,540 --> 01:34:01,820
I kind of have to disagree here.

2753
01:34:01,820 --> 01:34:05,380
Maybe ordering out every day was not a great idea, Lily.

2754
01:34:05,560 --> 01:34:06,840
Maybe we should start cooking.

2755
01:34:07,180 --> 01:34:08,540
Maybe we should...

2756
01:34:08,540 --> 01:34:12,580
But cooking takes time and effort and skill.

2757
01:34:12,620 --> 01:34:17,480
Yeah, but cooking is like $10 versus $50 each day.

2758
01:34:18,660 --> 01:34:21,440
Maybe we can cut costs somewhere else.

2759
01:34:21,480 --> 01:34:22,600
Like what, Lily?

2760
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:23,700
Like what?

2761
01:34:23,840 --> 01:34:25,080
Like medical bills or something.

2762
01:34:25,240 --> 01:34:25,880
I don't know.

2763
01:34:26,140 --> 01:34:27,080
Like what?

2764
01:34:27,260 --> 01:34:28,840
Just fuck the UTIs.

2765
01:34:28,840 --> 01:34:29,420
Then...

2766
01:34:29,420 --> 01:34:29,820
Then...

2767
01:34:31,820 --> 01:34:32,420
Who cares?

2768
01:34:34,080 --> 01:34:35,760
You can do it.

2769
01:34:35,760 --> 01:34:36,360
You can manage.

2770
01:34:36,860 --> 01:34:37,540
What if...

2771
01:34:37,540 --> 01:34:38,260
What do you mean?

2772
01:34:38,480 --> 01:34:41,380
Our company's gonna go under if we don't cut costs.

2773
01:34:42,840 --> 01:34:44,240
Also, we need to sleep.

2774
01:34:44,320 --> 01:34:44,740
I'm yeepy.

2775
01:34:46,520 --> 01:34:47,360
I'm yeepy.

2776
01:34:48,060 --> 01:34:50,600
Me, me, me, me, me, me, me.

2777
01:34:50,940 --> 01:34:52,980
Me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me.

2778
01:34:53,040 --> 01:34:54,660
It's company sleep time.

2779
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:56,740
It's company sleep time, everybody.

2780
01:34:57,300 --> 01:34:59,280
It's company sleep time.

2781
01:34:59,380 --> 01:34:59,860
Go ahead.

2782
01:34:59,980 --> 01:35:00,620
Go to bed.

2783
01:35:00,660 --> 01:35:01,160
Oh.

2784
01:35:01,940 --> 01:35:03,220
Sleep or perish.

2785
01:35:10,200 --> 01:35:12,180
Why is the sun still up?

2786
01:35:12,920 --> 01:35:15,640
My mandatory company sleep time, guys.

2787
01:35:15,860 --> 01:35:21,820
If I open my eyes and I see some wolves being awake, you're gonna have a bad, bad time.

2788
01:35:22,240 --> 01:35:23,240
I swear.

2789
01:35:23,360 --> 01:35:23,800
I...

2790
01:35:23,800 --> 01:35:32,680
We took this block of time in our schedule for mandatory company sleep time.

2791
01:35:32,820 --> 01:35:37,180
And you are wasting company's time right now by not sleeping.

2792
01:35:38,540 --> 01:35:39,820
You have to sleep.

2793
01:35:41,620 --> 01:35:43,720
This is why we have to cut costs.

2794
01:35:44,780 --> 01:35:48,800
Do you want me to remove company sleep time?

2795
01:35:51,520 --> 01:35:52,780
Wait, wait, wait.

2796
01:35:53,800 --> 01:35:54,420
Wait, that's her!

2797
01:35:55,600 --> 01:35:56,760
Come back, puppy!

2798
01:35:57,140 --> 01:35:57,460
No!

2799
01:36:00,660 --> 01:36:02,180
What the fuck?

2800
01:36:02,240 --> 01:36:05,040
Why did she like pop up next to us?

2801
01:36:05,600 --> 01:36:08,740
She was like, oh, you're nice and vulnerable and lonely.

2802
01:36:13,860 --> 01:36:16,820
She was like, peek-a-boo, peek-a-boo.

2803
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:19,420
You guys wanted to take my puppy.

2804
01:36:20,040 --> 01:36:22,600
At this point, she was just flexing, bro.

2805
01:36:22,680 --> 01:36:23,780
She's like, oh, I can't sleep.

2806
01:36:23,800 --> 01:36:24,240
You can't catch me.

2807
01:36:24,280 --> 01:36:25,080
Oh, you can't catch me.

2808
01:36:25,260 --> 01:36:26,320
Here's the edge again!

2809
01:36:27,920 --> 01:36:28,880
Oh, you made it out.

2810
01:36:29,060 --> 01:36:29,400
Boom!

2811
01:36:30,060 --> 01:36:31,240
Alright, I'm gonna pee more.

2812
01:36:31,820 --> 01:36:32,720
We need to pee more.

2813
01:36:32,740 --> 01:36:33,780
It's not fully ours, yes.

2814
01:36:34,540 --> 01:36:36,040
It has to be fully ours.

2815
01:36:36,380 --> 01:36:37,960
It has to be more yellow.

2816
01:36:38,760 --> 01:36:39,860
Wait, I'll pee on the animals.

2817
01:36:40,640 --> 01:36:41,240
More pee.

2818
01:36:41,920 --> 01:36:43,040
Bang, did you find...

2819
01:36:43,820 --> 01:36:45,160
Bang, did you find a den?

2820
01:36:45,320 --> 01:36:46,240
Why are you just peeing?

2821
01:36:46,940 --> 01:36:48,000
That's not your job.

2822
01:36:48,120 --> 01:36:49,700
Your job is to find a house.

2823
01:36:50,560 --> 01:36:51,200
Look, pee.

2824
01:36:51,200 --> 01:36:56,440
Performance review is like in two days and it doesn't look really nice right now.

2825
01:36:58,480 --> 01:37:03,280
At this point, the best we can do is give you a nice reference for your next job.

2826
01:37:03,860 --> 01:37:10,960
Bang, if you don't find a den by the end of this day, that performance review ain't gonna look so good, Bang.

2827
01:37:13,080 --> 01:37:15,600
You're gonna have some holes in your resume.

2828
01:37:16,040 --> 01:37:18,440
Yeah, you might need to update your resume soon.

2829
01:37:21,660 --> 01:37:26,280
I'm just gonna say, your ability to be a wolf is not looking so good.

2830
01:37:29,120 --> 01:37:32,680
On a scale from one to wolf, you're... I don't know.

2831
01:37:32,740 --> 01:37:35,040
I don't know, you're more like a fucking dog.

2832
01:37:37,460 --> 01:37:38,860
A domesticated one.

2833
01:37:39,100 --> 01:37:43,420
Not like the good kind of domesticated dog, more like a fucking chihuahua.

2834
01:37:45,740 --> 01:37:47,020
Fucking little rat.

2835
01:37:47,380 --> 01:37:47,720
Yeah.

2836
01:37:48,460 --> 01:37:50,320
One more, we need one more.

2837
01:37:51,200 --> 01:37:51,560
Hex!

2838
01:37:51,720 --> 01:37:52,060
I'm...

2839
01:37:52,060 --> 01:37:56,140
We need one more hexagon and we need three more caves.

2840
01:37:56,860 --> 01:38:02,180
I'm trying to unlock this hexagon and now this cat is like... on my ass.

2841
01:38:02,280 --> 01:38:02,820
Go away, shit.

2842
01:38:02,820 --> 01:38:03,220
Just run.

2843
01:38:03,220 --> 01:38:04,320
Just run away.

2844
01:38:05,820 --> 01:38:07,540
I want this territory.

2845
01:38:07,600 --> 01:38:09,060
I want this to be mine.

2846
01:38:09,480 --> 01:38:11,040
Bro, what's the cat gonna do?

2847
01:38:11,220 --> 01:38:12,280
It's a fucking cat.

2848
01:38:12,960 --> 01:38:13,720
That's right.

2849
01:38:14,100 --> 01:38:15,560
Yeah, kill him.

2850
01:38:15,960 --> 01:38:17,160
No cats allowed.

2851
01:38:17,300 --> 01:38:17,980
Fuck you, cat.

2852
01:38:18,280 --> 01:38:19,380
No cats allowed.

2853
01:38:19,580 --> 01:38:20,820
Nom nom nom nom nom nom.

2854
01:38:21,200 --> 01:38:22,120
Alright, I'm peeing.

2855
01:38:22,580 --> 01:38:24,480
I'm gonna make this hexagon mine.

2856
01:38:24,820 --> 01:38:26,200
You cannot run.

2857
01:38:28,960 --> 01:38:29,620
I'm faster.

2858
01:38:30,600 --> 01:38:31,200
Alright.

2859
01:38:31,400 --> 01:38:32,340
I'm faster.

2860
01:38:33,240 --> 01:38:33,840
How's this sound?

2861
01:38:33,840 --> 01:38:34,740
Well, you better be faster.

2862
01:38:34,760 --> 01:38:36,040
You fucking invested in speed.

2863
01:38:36,400 --> 01:38:36,580
No, no, no, no.

2864
01:38:37,460 --> 01:38:40,240
My speed and my spin is taking off.

2865
01:38:40,320 --> 01:38:40,840
Yes!

2866
01:38:42,300 --> 01:38:44,040
I knew it was worth it!

2867
01:38:44,340 --> 01:38:45,820
Did you kill the cat?

2868
01:38:46,540 --> 01:38:48,420
No, but I'm catching up to it.

2869
01:38:48,720 --> 01:38:49,740
He's laughing.

2870
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:51,020
He caught up.

2871
01:38:51,200 --> 01:38:52,100
I'm catching up to the cat.

2872
01:38:52,500 --> 01:38:53,520
Come here, kitty.

2873
01:38:54,700 --> 01:38:55,860
Kitty, kitty, kitty.

2874
01:38:56,180 --> 01:38:57,180
Psst, psst, psst, psst, psst.

2875
01:38:59,040 --> 01:39:00,940
Why do we still only have one home?

2876
01:39:01,040 --> 01:39:02,500
Only Dirt found us a home.

2877
01:39:02,740 --> 01:39:02,940
No.

2878
01:39:04,220 --> 01:39:08,220
I knew Dirt was like the... I knew hiring Dirt was the right call, Lily.

2879
01:39:08,680 --> 01:39:12,740
When I saw that resume, I knew he was gonna...

2880
01:39:12,740 --> 01:39:13,540
Yeah, Dirt is the one.

2881
01:39:13,640 --> 01:39:16,100
He'll be very valuable to the company.

2882
01:39:16,260 --> 01:39:20,520
Yeah, Dirt was gonna make Shrimp Goon Incorporated a rising star.

2883
01:39:25,180 --> 01:39:26,820
He knows what's up.

2884
01:39:27,300 --> 01:39:35,520
Someone said... Someone... Apparently, Dirt's a dragoon and they're like... Dirt was in the chat and he told us he had 200 hours on WolfQuest.

2885
01:39:36,500 --> 01:39:37,420
Holy fuck!

2886
01:39:37,420 --> 01:39:38,480
Dirt knows!

2887
01:39:39,120 --> 01:39:41,500
Oh my god, Dirt is a gamer!

2888
01:39:42,320 --> 01:39:43,740
He's a knower.

2889
01:39:43,760 --> 01:39:45,300
He's a knower.

2890
01:39:46,480 --> 01:39:47,900
I just joined MNOLA.

2891
01:39:47,920 --> 01:39:50,420
We knew we had a couple 50 plus hour ends.

2892
01:39:50,520 --> 01:39:51,480
I knew too.

2893
01:39:51,560 --> 01:39:52,280
I knew it.

2894
01:39:52,340 --> 01:39:58,680
Those who joined instantly in WolfQuest Anniversary, they've... they were already playing the game before.

2895
01:39:58,740 --> 01:40:01,480
They were playing long before we played.

2896
01:40:01,760 --> 01:40:01,920
Yeah.

2897
01:40:02,400 --> 01:40:06,800
Dude already had it like loaded up before the stream even started.

2898
01:40:08,120 --> 01:40:09,180
They knew.

2899
01:40:10,240 --> 01:40:11,260
They fucking knew.

2900
01:40:11,260 --> 01:40:15,440
You were just counting on playing being like, Wade, they're playing my game!

2901
01:40:15,580 --> 01:40:16,520
They're playing my game!

2902
01:40:17,220 --> 01:40:20,500
Let me leave my... my 200 hours on WolfQuest.

2903
01:40:20,520 --> 01:40:21,560
I'm gonna go to server real quick.

2904
01:40:23,680 --> 01:40:26,020
Let me leave my family real quick.

2905
01:40:26,440 --> 01:40:27,540
Alright, I pee.

2906
01:40:28,580 --> 01:40:31,000
Do we have 15 hexagons now guys?

2907
01:40:31,320 --> 01:40:32,140
Do we do it?

2908
01:40:32,220 --> 01:40:32,420
Yippee!

2909
01:40:32,940 --> 01:40:34,360
We still need one more!

2910
01:40:35,280 --> 01:40:36,500
I killed the cat.

2911
01:40:38,720 --> 01:40:40,420
We need... guys!

2912
01:40:41,700 --> 01:40:42,220
Dirt!

2913
01:40:43,060 --> 01:40:44,660
Dirt, I know I can trust you.

2914
01:40:44,700 --> 01:40:46,060
Find us another home, Dirt.

2915
01:40:46,360 --> 01:40:48,840
Fanning doing quite a great job right now.

2916
01:40:52,420 --> 01:40:56,460
Hey, go shadow Dirt and learn how to be a real wolf.

2917
01:40:56,640 --> 01:40:58,020
Go shadow Dirt?

2918
01:40:59,460 --> 01:41:01,380
Learn how to be a good one.

2919
01:41:02,860 --> 01:41:05,100
We're giving you one more chance.

2920
01:41:05,740 --> 01:41:07,720
Shadow the real wolf.

2921
01:41:10,180 --> 01:41:13,400
Only this way you will one day become a real wolf.

2922
01:41:13,600 --> 01:41:18,000
Yeah, one day you'll be just as good as a wolf like Dirt.

2923
01:41:18,160 --> 01:41:19,720
Fan, we don't need food!

2924
01:41:19,720 --> 01:41:20,800
We're all full!

2925
01:41:24,800 --> 01:41:25,800
I'm claiming this.

2926
01:41:25,800 --> 01:41:26,680
I'm claiming this so hard.

2927
01:41:26,800 --> 01:41:27,120
That's okay.

2928
01:41:27,220 --> 01:41:27,800
That's why...

2929
01:41:27,800 --> 01:41:29,900
That's why Fang is just an intern.

2930
01:41:31,060 --> 01:41:32,060
Pleasure watching you.

2931
01:41:33,420 --> 01:41:34,520
Look, Fang.

2932
01:41:34,700 --> 01:41:37,000
I hate to break it to you, but like...

2933
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:38,780
That college reference...

2934
01:41:38,780 --> 01:41:41,480
That extra credit ain't looking so good, Fang.

2935
01:41:41,560 --> 01:41:42,200
You got it.

2936
01:41:42,740 --> 01:41:45,180
I don't know about the extra credit anymore.

2937
01:41:45,620 --> 01:41:46,660
Fang, you got it.

2938
01:41:46,780 --> 01:41:48,360
Fang is feeding Dirt.

2939
01:41:51,880 --> 01:41:54,600
I'm feeding Dirt right now.

2940
01:41:54,960 --> 01:41:56,000
You know what?

2941
01:41:56,280 --> 01:41:57,440
That's a good intern.

2942
01:41:57,700 --> 01:41:59,900
Intern, show your belly to Fang.

2943
01:42:00,260 --> 01:42:02,020
Fang, show your belly to Dirt.

2944
01:42:02,040 --> 01:42:02,520
Or to me.

2945
01:42:02,760 --> 01:42:03,600
Show your belly.

2946
01:42:04,540 --> 01:42:05,100
That's right.

2947
01:42:05,300 --> 01:42:05,880
Show it.

2948
01:42:06,240 --> 01:42:07,360
Or I'm gonna growl.

2949
01:42:09,300 --> 01:42:12,000
We have 15 out of 15 hexagons!

2950
01:42:12,100 --> 01:42:12,900
Oh, we did it!

2951
01:42:13,960 --> 01:42:14,540
Let's go!

2952
01:42:14,900 --> 01:42:15,460
We did it!

2953
01:42:15,540 --> 01:42:17,360
We just need to discover dance.

2954
01:42:19,080 --> 01:42:19,700
We did it!

2955
01:42:19,700 --> 01:42:20,420
We just need dance.

2956
01:42:21,260 --> 01:42:21,780
Alright.

2957
01:42:22,060 --> 01:42:23,360
Alright, our main goal.

2958
01:42:23,440 --> 01:42:25,100
We don't end stream until we have puppies.

2959
01:42:25,840 --> 01:42:26,620
That's our goal.

2960
01:42:26,620 --> 01:42:27,660
We need the puppies.

2961
01:42:27,860 --> 01:42:28,200
We need.

2962
01:42:28,200 --> 01:42:29,040
That is our...

2963
01:42:29,040 --> 01:42:30,240
We have to have...

2964
01:42:30,240 --> 01:42:31,000
I will...

2965
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:33,260
I will make the 24 hour thing.

2966
01:42:33,500 --> 01:42:34,580
If I have to.

2967
01:42:34,820 --> 01:42:35,940
I need puppies.

2968
01:42:37,220 --> 01:42:42,180
We must be the worst WolfQuest players out there if it takes us 24 hours.

2969
01:42:46,980 --> 01:42:49,960
I appreciate this not taking 24 hours.

2970
01:42:51,020 --> 01:42:53,160
I think it's 48 if I have to.

2971
01:42:54,880 --> 01:42:55,980
Dirt, stop hunting.

2972
01:42:56,060 --> 01:42:56,860
We need...

2973
01:42:56,860 --> 01:42:58,260
We need them dead.

2974
01:42:59,280 --> 01:42:59,720
I'm bored.

2975
01:42:59,720 --> 01:42:59,900
You know what?

2976
01:43:00,020 --> 01:43:00,220
Okay, no.

2977
01:43:00,280 --> 01:43:00,620
That's fine.

2978
01:43:00,720 --> 01:43:01,560
Wait, you're gonna eat for yourself?

2979
01:43:01,800 --> 01:43:02,300
What about me?

2980
01:43:02,340 --> 01:43:02,940
I'm the alpha.

2981
01:43:06,660 --> 01:43:08,260
I'm following Dirt right now.

2982
01:43:09,320 --> 01:43:10,360
Wait, where are you?

2983
01:43:10,460 --> 01:43:10,800
I'm at the border.

2984
01:43:11,080 --> 01:43:11,840
You're at the border?

2985
01:43:11,860 --> 01:43:12,160
We don't even know where you are.

2986
01:43:12,160 --> 01:43:13,420
We don't need any more hexagons.

2987
01:43:14,280 --> 01:43:15,980
I am looking for a den.

2988
01:43:17,380 --> 01:43:17,820
Alright.

2989
01:43:17,920 --> 01:43:18,880
So we can make babies.

2990
01:43:18,880 --> 01:43:19,840
I'm following Dirt.

2991
01:43:19,920 --> 01:43:21,420
I need to make sure he is on track.

2992
01:43:22,120 --> 01:43:25,600
I need to make sure he knows what he's doing.

2993
01:43:25,640 --> 01:43:26,200
I'm his supervisor.

2994
01:43:26,580 --> 01:43:28,280
He used to be supervised all the time.

2995
01:43:28,900 --> 01:43:31,620
He's that one annoying co-worker who gets nothing done.

2996
01:43:32,720 --> 01:43:35,460
It's like, yup, gonna have to supervise Dirt again.

2997
01:43:35,740 --> 01:43:40,320
I'm the supervisor that gets paid twice as much as Dirt for just watching.

2998
01:43:41,300 --> 01:43:42,120
For how many hours?

2999
01:43:42,120 --> 01:43:42,140
For how many hours?

3000
01:43:42,160 --> 01:43:42,640
For 5% of the work!

3001
01:43:42,920 --> 01:43:48,260
For only 5% of the work, I just watch him.

3002
01:43:48,540 --> 01:43:51,940
You show up late, you sit around on your chair watching a bit.

3003
01:43:52,180 --> 01:43:54,340
And now I'm like, whoop, there we go.

3004
01:43:54,580 --> 01:43:56,680
Gonna go on my Ferrari now.

3005
01:43:56,880 --> 01:43:57,660
Bye, guys.

3006
01:43:58,200 --> 01:43:58,700
Vroom vroom.

3007
01:43:58,920 --> 01:43:59,420
Vroom vroom.

3008
01:44:00,100 --> 01:44:03,740
Oh, guys, you guys didn't get invited to the company dinner with the CEO?

3009
01:44:04,160 --> 01:44:05,500
Man, that sucks, guys.

3010
01:44:06,660 --> 01:44:07,700
That's too bad.

3011
01:44:07,720 --> 01:44:08,100
What the heck.

3012
01:44:08,100 --> 01:44:08,540
That's too bad.

3013
01:44:08,720 --> 01:44:10,300
You gotta earn it like me.

3014
01:44:10,620 --> 01:44:12,020
Yeah, you gotta earn it like me.

3015
01:44:12,020 --> 01:44:12,140
You gotta earn it like me.

3016
01:44:12,160 --> 01:44:15,840
Guess you didn't do it, you know, you didn't work hard enough this company.

3017
01:44:15,960 --> 01:44:19,120

3021
01:44:34,240 --> 01:44:40,000
I knew supervising supervising is a very hard job guys.

3022
01:44:40,220 --> 01:44:41,040
It's so hard.

3023
01:44:41,120 --> 01:44:51,500
It's so difficult I mean like Stan It's so hard like I have to like watch dirt over here and like I could be doing other stuff right now But instead I have to make sure it does a good job.

3024
01:44:51,620 --> 01:45:08,160

3025
01:45:11,840 --> 01:45:13,540
To all of us at some point.

Come on.

3045
01:46:32,850 --> 01:46:36,410
I know you're limping and you have a broken leg, but this is important.

3046
01:46:36,850 --> 01:46:39,450
But come on, I have to, you know...

3047
01:46:39,450 --> 01:46:42,210
Sometimes you just have to push through, you know, just like me.

3048
01:46:42,210 --> 01:46:45,130
You need to give us 150% with that broken leg.

3049
01:46:45,370 --> 01:46:46,290
Right there.

3050
01:46:47,310 --> 01:46:49,410
This company is like a family.

3051
01:46:49,570 --> 01:46:53,090
Which I will remind you when I get you a pint of pizza.

3052
01:46:54,090 --> 01:46:55,210
Pizza party!

3053
01:46:55,910 --> 01:46:56,810
Pizza party!

3054
01:46:57,090 --> 01:46:58,050
We're a family.

3055
01:46:59,970 --> 01:47:01,790
It's okay, we have pizza now!

3056
01:47:02,990 --> 01:47:04,610

We have pizza!

3058
01:47:05,650 --> 01:47:07,870
Welcome to Shrimp Goons Incorporated!

3059
01:47:09,450 --> 01:47:10,310
Don't worry.

3060
01:47:11,430 --> 01:47:12,150
Don't worry.

3061
01:47:12,210 --> 01:47:16,010
Your overtime will be paid nicely in pizza time.

3062
01:47:16,010 --> 01:47:16,690
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3063
01:47:16,770 --> 01:47:19,270
It's cold and cheap, but don't worry about it.

3064
01:47:21,430 --> 01:47:23,890
The cheese is like fully hard on you.

3065
01:47:26,450 --> 01:47:30,470
It's like, we don't even buy it from a pizza place.

3066
01:47:30,630 --> 01:47:33,810
We go to like a supermarket for those refrigerated pizzas.

3067
01:47:36,310 --> 01:47:37,990
Fucking oven pizzas.

3068
01:47:38,110 --> 01:47:38,730
Yeah, yeah.

3069
01:47:38,730 --> 01:47:42,850
And if we get like a used pizza box from like Domino's.

3070
01:47:45,070 --> 01:47:46,910
Like fresh Domino's pizza!

3071
01:47:47,190 --> 01:47:47,490
Fresh Domino's pizza!

3072
01:47:47,490 --> 01:47:49,310
It just doesn't look like Domino's pizza.

3073
01:47:49,510 --> 01:47:50,130
What the heck?

3074
01:47:50,230 --> 01:47:51,130
What are you trying to say?

3075
01:47:51,170 --> 01:47:52,510
It's in the pizza box.

3076
01:47:53,530 --> 01:47:54,810
What do you mean?

3077
01:47:55,370 --> 01:47:56,830
I'm saying I'm lying.

3078
01:47:56,950 --> 01:47:57,650
What the heck, man?

3079
01:47:57,650 --> 01:48:00,590
Are you trying to say your bosses are lying to you?

3080
01:48:00,690 --> 01:48:01,950
After everything we did.

3081
01:48:02,770 --> 01:48:04,770
After everything we've done.

3082
01:48:04,930 --> 01:48:05,190
Wow.

3083
01:48:05,190 --> 01:48:07,690
Yeah, we opened the server for all of you guys.

3084
01:48:10,050 --> 01:48:13,470
It's almost like you don't appreciate our hard work as supervisors.

3085
01:48:13,950 --> 01:48:14,410
I know!

3086
01:48:14,410 --> 01:48:16,890
Look at all these hexes we got for you.

3087
01:48:17,050 --> 01:48:20,830
All 15 of them was done from Lily and I.

3088
01:48:21,110 --> 01:48:25,430
And all we asked for you was a den.

3089
01:48:25,610 --> 01:48:26,210
A home.

3090
01:48:26,290 --> 01:48:27,810
A place to call home.

3091
01:48:28,730 --> 01:48:31,390
We just wanted a place to call home.

3092
01:48:31,430 --> 01:48:33,090
And this is how you pay your family?

3093
01:48:33,690 --> 01:48:33,970
Yeah.

3094
01:48:34,550 --> 01:48:37,650
We took you in, gave you shelter, gave you work.

3095
01:48:38,090 --> 01:48:38,490
Yeah!

3096
01:48:39,350 --> 01:48:40,810
Where is... Oh, it's E.P.

3097
01:48:40,810 --> 01:48:40,990
time.

3098
01:48:41,230 --> 01:48:42,490
I found a new dog.

3099
01:48:42,710 --> 01:48:43,710
Wait, a new dog?

3100
01:48:44,990 --> 01:48:45,550
It's E.P.

3101
01:48:45,550 --> 01:48:46,050
time though.

3102
01:48:46,390 --> 01:48:47,130
I found two.

3103
01:48:49,470 --> 01:48:50,270
E.P.

3104
01:48:50,370 --> 01:48:50,570
time.

3105
01:48:53,090 --> 01:48:55,550
Wait, you guys all spawned in with me.

3106
01:48:55,750 --> 01:48:56,390
Wait, what the heck?

3107
01:48:56,430 --> 01:48:56,930
What the fuck?

3108
01:48:57,810 --> 01:48:58,490
What was that?

3109
01:48:58,550 --> 01:48:59,730
That was trippy.

3110
01:49:00,450 --> 01:49:00,850
What?

3111
01:49:01,970 --> 01:49:02,370
What?

3112
01:49:02,450 --> 01:49:02,990
That's right.

3113
01:49:03,010 --> 01:49:03,930
That's when you know I'm alpha.

3114
01:49:07,650 --> 01:49:09,750
Don't even the snow part it.

3115
01:49:09,830 --> 01:49:10,670
Like, what the heck?

3116
01:49:11,070 --> 01:49:11,130
Yeah.

3117
01:49:11,230 --> 01:49:14,230
This is when... There you go.

3118
01:49:14,370 --> 01:49:15,570
Oh my god, there's all of us.

3119
01:49:16,370 --> 01:49:17,430
Me, me, me, me, me, me.

3120
01:49:17,430 --> 01:49:18,190
I'm being cute.

3121
01:49:18,290 --> 01:49:19,010
Look at us.

3122
01:49:19,010 --> 01:49:19,850
This is so cute.

3123
01:49:20,130 --> 01:49:21,730
Oh my god, look at all these wolves.

3124
01:49:22,990 --> 01:49:24,850
Look at all these wolfies.

3125
01:49:24,870 --> 01:49:25,670
Oh my god.

3126
01:49:26,650 --> 01:49:27,850
It's day time.

3127
01:49:29,090 --> 01:49:29,530
Yippee!

3128
01:49:30,390 --> 01:49:30,830
Yay!

3129
01:49:31,690 --> 01:49:32,390
Wait, we are?

3130
01:49:32,710 --> 01:49:33,290
We are!

3131
01:49:33,750 --> 01:49:34,870
Guys, we did it!

3132
01:49:35,030 --> 01:49:35,030
We're next to a den.

3133
01:49:35,150 --> 01:49:35,710
What the heck?

3134
01:49:35,710 --> 01:49:36,750
We did it!

3135
01:49:38,010 --> 01:49:38,630
How do we?

3136
01:49:38,870 --> 01:49:38,950
It's right...

3137
01:49:38,950 --> 01:49:39,830
Wait, wait.

3138
01:49:39,830 --> 01:49:41,150
We have to kill her.

3139
01:49:41,250 --> 01:49:41,890
Okay, guys, come on.

3140
01:49:41,930 --> 01:49:42,290
Come on, fight.

3141
01:49:42,370 --> 01:49:42,610
Surround her.

3142
01:49:42,610 --> 01:49:43,370
Oh, we have to fight first.

3143
01:49:43,430 --> 01:49:43,970
Surround her.

3144
01:49:44,270 --> 01:49:45,130
This is our...

3145
01:49:45,130 --> 01:49:45,550
Surround her.

3146
01:49:45,810 --> 01:49:46,510
Surround her.

3147
01:49:46,530 --> 01:49:47,390
This is our den.

3148
01:49:47,850 --> 01:49:48,830
This is our den.

3149
01:49:48,850 --> 01:49:49,250
Our puppies will be here.

3150
01:49:49,310 --> 01:49:50,670
This is our... Yeah, this is our children now.

3151
01:49:52,270 --> 01:49:54,390
This is for our pups only.

3152
01:49:54,490 --> 01:49:55,410
Our puppies.

3153
01:49:56,690 --> 01:49:57,590
Don't let her go.

3154
01:49:57,590 --> 01:49:57,870
Don't let her go.

3155
01:50:00,530 --> 01:50:02,110
How is she still half HP?

3156
01:50:02,230 --> 01:50:03,670
There's literally four of us.

3157
01:50:04,110 --> 01:50:04,550
Right?

3158
01:50:04,570 --> 01:50:05,750
Like, she's strong.

3159
01:50:06,010 --> 01:50:07,630
Bro, how old is she?

3160
01:50:08,310 --> 01:50:09,510
That's not a wolf.

3161
01:50:09,570 --> 01:50:10,330
That's a cougar.

3162
01:50:10,390 --> 01:50:11,910
She can pack a pond, bro.

3163
01:50:12,250 --> 01:50:12,770
Whoa!

3164
01:50:14,990 --> 01:50:16,110
That's fucking right.

3165
01:50:16,590 --> 01:50:18,050
That's our home now.

3166
01:50:18,110 --> 01:50:18,510
That's right.

3167
01:50:18,510 --> 01:50:18,550
That's right.

3168
01:50:18,690 --> 01:50:19,990
Okay, how do we clean this?

3169
01:50:20,090 --> 01:50:20,590
Our den.

3170
01:50:20,810 --> 01:50:21,290
Piss.

3171
01:50:21,550 --> 01:50:22,210
Do we...

3172
01:50:22,210 --> 01:50:23,430
Too fast.

3173
01:50:24,570 --> 01:50:25,090
Piss.

3174
01:50:25,370 --> 01:50:25,890
Piss.

3175
01:50:25,890 --> 01:50:26,510
PP time.

3176
01:50:26,810 --> 01:50:27,150
IP.

3177
01:50:27,570 --> 01:50:28,250
IPP time.

3178
01:50:28,430 --> 01:50:29,190
IPP time.

3179
01:50:29,830 --> 01:50:31,090
Our den now.

3180
01:50:31,490 --> 01:50:32,350
Alright, Fing.

3181
01:50:32,970 --> 01:50:34,410
We need another home.

3182
01:50:34,490 --> 01:50:34,810
Fing!

3183
01:50:35,470 --> 01:50:36,470
You know, I'm gonna...

3184
01:50:36,470 --> 01:50:37,630
We're gonna splurge a little bit.

3185
01:50:37,630 --> 01:50:38,970
Now bring me food.

3186
01:50:39,190 --> 01:50:40,330
I'm ordering Uber Eats.

3187
01:50:41,330 --> 01:50:43,770
I would like one rabbit, please.

3188
01:50:44,790 --> 01:50:45,950
One rabbit, please.

3189
01:50:45,970 --> 01:50:46,810
Thank you very much.

3190
01:50:46,830 --> 01:50:47,770
Alright, 10% tip.

3191
01:50:50,450 --> 01:50:51,410
How generous!

3192
01:50:54,510 --> 01:50:56,070
A whole 10%?

3193
01:50:56,110 --> 01:50:56,790
No way!

3194
01:50:56,810 --> 01:51:00,530
A whole 10% tip if you get me that rabbit on Uber Eats.

3195
01:51:02,890 --> 01:51:04,290
We need two more!

3196
01:51:05,310 --> 01:51:06,190
Two more!

3197
01:51:06,190 --> 01:51:07,670
And then we'll have...

3198
01:51:07,670 --> 01:51:08,010
Come on, we got this!

3199
01:51:08,610 --> 01:51:08,990
Puppers!

3200
01:51:11,070 --> 01:51:11,450
Puppies!

3201
01:51:11,490 --> 01:51:12,270
Reveal two dens.

3202
01:51:12,770 --> 01:51:14,230
Okay, you established and found several.

3203
01:51:14,310 --> 01:51:15,310
It's time to give your pack...

3204
01:51:15,310 --> 01:51:16,750
It's time to give our pack a name!

3205
01:51:17,130 --> 01:51:17,670
How should we name it?

3206
01:51:17,770 --> 01:51:18,250
Oh, wait, wait.

3207
01:51:18,250 --> 01:51:19,410
Shrimp Goons Incorporated.

3208
01:51:20,490 --> 01:51:22,270
Shrimp Goons Incorporated.

3209
01:51:22,330 --> 01:51:22,810
Let's go.

3210
01:51:23,130 --> 01:51:23,310
Yeah.

3211
01:51:23,310 --> 01:51:23,850
There you go.

3212
01:51:24,790 --> 01:51:25,170
Continue.

3213
01:51:26,890 --> 01:51:27,750
Oh my god!

3214
01:51:27,890 --> 01:51:28,430
Oh, what's this?

3215
01:51:28,510 --> 01:51:28,810
Okay.

3216
01:51:28,830 --> 01:51:32,390
You wanna keep working on territory and looking for dens or proceed to choosing a den?

3217
01:51:32,490 --> 01:51:32,850
You know what?

3218
01:51:32,950 --> 01:51:33,970
We can choose a den now.

3219
01:51:34,310 --> 01:51:34,650
Right?

3220
01:51:34,650 --> 01:51:35,770
We can choose a den.

3221
01:51:35,790 --> 01:51:36,050
Yeah.

3222
01:51:36,050 --> 01:51:36,170
We can choose a den.

3223
01:51:36,170 --> 01:51:36,590
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3224
01:51:36,730 --> 01:51:37,470
Choose a den.

3225
01:51:37,530 --> 01:51:37,810
Surely.

3226
01:51:38,350 --> 01:51:38,790
Alright.

3227
01:51:39,110 --> 01:51:42,170
Remember, you must maintain it even when your pups require all your time.

3228
01:51:42,290 --> 01:51:47,370
The smaller your territory, the more likely stranger wolves will be tempted to come in and kill your pups!

3229
01:51:47,430 --> 01:51:48,590
Kill my puppies?

3230
01:51:48,670 --> 01:51:49,010
Hello?

3231
01:51:49,470 --> 01:51:51,530
You can't kill our puppies if we kill them first!

3232
01:51:52,710 --> 01:51:55,550
Yeah, we'll just kill them before they kill us.

3233
01:51:55,590 --> 01:51:55,890
What the heck?

3234
01:51:55,890 --> 01:51:56,710
We'll just kill their puppies.

3235
01:51:57,490 --> 01:51:57,930
Whoa!

3236
01:51:58,750 --> 01:51:59,190
Oh?

3237
01:51:59,270 --> 01:51:59,670
Oh?

3238
01:52:00,310 --> 01:52:01,090
Puppy cutscene?

3239
01:52:01,270 --> 01:52:02,010
Puppy cutscene?

3240
01:52:02,690 --> 01:52:04,270
Your pups will be born soon.

3241
01:52:04,510 --> 01:52:06,150
Now that the snow is beginning to fall, we can go back to the desert.

3242
01:52:06,750 --> 01:52:08,570
It's time to find a good den site.

3243
01:52:08,710 --> 01:52:11,370
There's no need to dig a new den for yourself since there are many potential sites.

3244
01:52:12,430 --> 01:52:12,830
Many?

3245
01:52:13,050 --> 01:52:13,410
Sure.

3246
01:52:14,450 --> 01:52:17,490
We'll revisit the dens you discovered over the winter.

3247
01:52:17,970 --> 01:52:18,630
Oh, okay.

3248
01:52:18,690 --> 01:52:21,530
So we just go back to where we found our den.

3249
01:52:21,710 --> 01:52:21,990
Oh, hey.

3250
01:52:22,070 --> 01:52:22,690
Oh, my rabbit!

3251
01:52:22,690 --> 01:52:23,650
My Uber Eats is here!

3252
01:52:24,590 --> 01:52:24,990
Nice.

3253
01:52:25,190 --> 01:52:25,950
Uber Eats!

3254
01:52:26,350 --> 01:52:26,750
Nice.

3255
01:52:26,810 --> 01:52:27,750
I got my Uber Eats.

3256
01:52:28,810 --> 01:52:29,610
Thank you, Faye.

3257
01:52:29,730 --> 01:52:34,390
Cavities underneath all tree roots and gaps on the large boulders.

3258
01:52:34,630 --> 01:52:35,030
Okay.

3259
01:52:35,350 --> 01:52:35,610
Alright.

3260
01:52:35,730 --> 01:52:36,130
You know what?

3261
01:52:36,130 --> 01:52:39,990
I think it was a good idea for us to go open the desert.

3262
01:52:41,490 --> 01:52:41,970
Yeah.

3263
01:52:42,130 --> 01:52:43,830
It would have taken forever.

3264
01:52:44,130 --> 01:52:44,930
Holy shit.

3265
01:52:44,970 --> 01:52:47,190
We would have figured this out on our own.

3266
01:52:47,350 --> 01:52:49,330
I would have also looked for something way bigger.

3267
01:52:49,450 --> 01:52:51,330
I was like, oh, den, no problem.

3268
01:52:51,490 --> 01:52:53,890
I would just look for like a huge massive cave.

3269
01:52:54,330 --> 01:52:55,570
How hard can it be?

3270
01:52:55,890 --> 01:52:57,490
Oh, is this a good den?

3271
01:52:57,570 --> 01:53:01,470
This is a wood and the trees providing cover will limit the ability for eagles?

3272
01:53:02,490 --> 01:53:04,630
The eagles can't eat our puppies?

3273
01:53:05,430 --> 01:53:06,110
What the hell?

3274
01:53:06,530 --> 01:53:08,030
They don't know how to do that.

3275
01:53:08,150 --> 01:53:08,490
What?

3276
01:53:09,590 --> 01:53:10,010
What?

3277
01:53:10,670 --> 01:53:11,090
Alright.

3278
01:53:11,230 --> 01:53:12,490
I'm going to go with this one.

3279
01:53:12,810 --> 01:53:14,910
The first one I found.

3280
01:53:15,170 --> 01:53:15,550
Whoa!

3281
01:53:16,050 --> 01:53:18,090
Do you have a cut seat or is it only me?

3282
01:53:18,890 --> 01:53:19,130
Wait.

3283
01:53:19,150 --> 01:53:19,770
I think it's only you.

3284
01:53:19,950 --> 01:53:20,950
I'm just running around.

3285
01:53:21,310 --> 01:53:21,590
Okay.

3286
01:53:21,790 --> 01:53:22,890
What do we name our den?

3287
01:53:23,410 --> 01:53:25,410
I'll give you the choice of the name.

3288
01:53:26,770 --> 01:53:27,770
You don't want to do that.

3289
01:53:28,050 --> 01:53:28,590
No, no.

3290
01:53:28,630 --> 01:53:28,930
It's fine.

3291
01:53:29,030 --> 01:53:31,290
I trust in you after your UTI.

3292
01:53:31,870 --> 01:53:34,670
I have my full trust on you.

3293
01:53:35,310 --> 01:53:36,110
Well, I'm going to go with this one.

3294
01:53:36,130 --> 01:53:38,910
Our den should be called infected butthole.

3295
01:53:40,310 --> 01:53:40,810
Okay.

3296
01:53:40,910 --> 01:53:42,090
I'll take one word from this.

3297
01:53:44,390 --> 01:53:45,330
Mild infection?

3298
01:53:46,830 --> 01:53:48,250
I'll give you infected.

3299
01:53:48,530 --> 01:53:49,350
I'll give you...

3300
01:53:52,650 --> 01:53:54,190
Infected toe clippings.

3301
01:53:54,270 --> 01:53:54,770
Okay.

3302
01:53:54,790 --> 01:53:55,850
I'll give you infected.

3303
01:53:56,090 --> 01:53:56,650
I'll give...

3304
01:53:58,870 --> 01:54:01,690
I have a feeling you don't like my names very much.

3305
01:54:02,910 --> 01:54:04,670
Something gives me the feeling.

3306
01:54:05,010 --> 01:54:06,010
I like 50.

3307
01:54:06,130 --> 01:54:07,330
I like 50% of it.

3308
01:54:09,550 --> 01:54:10,910
That's still a pass.

3309
01:54:11,430 --> 01:54:15,330
That's still a pass right there.

3310
01:54:18,290 --> 01:54:18,850
Okay.

3311
01:54:19,790 --> 01:54:20,350
Infected...

3312
01:54:20,350 --> 01:54:21,870
Flammable lighter fluids.

3313
01:54:22,190 --> 01:54:22,430
Okay.

3314
01:54:22,470 --> 01:54:22,930
It's okay.

3315
01:54:23,050 --> 01:54:24,050
I already named our...

3316
01:54:24,050 --> 01:54:25,770
Your den is ready for post.

3317
01:54:26,030 --> 01:54:26,570
It will be ready soon.

3318
01:54:26,570 --> 01:54:27,510
Yes, go up a moon.

3319
01:54:28,130 --> 01:54:28,690
Wait.

3320
01:54:28,770 --> 01:54:29,770
Who's the mom and dad?

3321
01:54:31,530 --> 01:54:34,330
I placed the quest completion dialogs open.

3322
01:54:34,870 --> 01:54:35,810
Who's the parents?

3323
01:54:35,830 --> 01:54:36,110
Who's the parents?

3324
01:54:36,110 --> 01:54:36,470
The parents?

3325
01:54:36,470 --> 01:54:39,250
Yes, how do my toes...

3326
01:54:39,250 --> 01:54:39,930
They just like...

3327
01:54:41,370 --> 01:54:42,990
Do you see this?

3328
01:54:43,430 --> 01:54:45,250
No, my screen's just black.

3329
01:54:45,550 --> 01:54:46,530
There it is.

3330
01:54:46,610 --> 01:54:47,210
There it is.

3331
01:54:47,750 --> 01:54:50,450
After nine weeks of gestation...

3332
01:54:50,450 --> 01:54:50,750
Oh my god.

3333
01:54:50,750 --> 01:54:52,130
Five pups are bored.

3334
01:54:52,230 --> 01:54:52,630
Five.

3335
01:54:52,830 --> 01:54:54,750
Bro, that's way too many mouths.

3336
01:54:55,290 --> 01:54:56,610
Blind and deaf?

3337
01:54:56,930 --> 01:54:57,430
Oh shi...

3338
01:54:57,430 --> 01:54:58,290
What?

3339
01:55:00,690 --> 01:55:01,790
What the fuck?

3340
01:55:02,210 --> 01:55:02,810
Useless.

3341
01:55:03,810 --> 01:55:04,410
Useless.

3342
01:55:04,450 --> 01:55:05,930
How do we put them to work?

3343
01:55:05,950 --> 01:55:06,090
Are there any other things...

3344
01:55:06,090 --> 01:55:06,450
It doesn't work!

3345
01:55:06,450 --> 01:55:07,610
If they're blind and deaf!

3346
01:55:07,710 --> 01:55:08,450
It lets me name them.

3347
01:55:08,630 --> 01:55:09,290
Oh no.

3348
01:55:10,050 --> 01:55:11,950
Oh no, it lets me name them.

3349
01:55:12,010 --> 01:55:12,130
Can you name them?

3350
01:55:12,170 --> 01:55:13,050
That's terrible.

3351
01:55:13,610 --> 01:55:16,610
For three weeks, they first emerged from the dead into the sunlight.

3352
01:55:16,690 --> 01:55:19,910
They all dark brown, but in a few weeks their pups' coats would change.

3353
01:55:20,270 --> 01:55:20,990
Is that me?

3354
01:55:22,110 --> 01:55:23,090
Am I the...

3355
01:55:23,090 --> 01:55:24,830
I thought I was male!

3356
01:55:26,590 --> 01:55:27,770
I'm a male too!

3357
01:55:27,970 --> 01:55:29,930
I'm also a male!

3358
01:55:29,930 --> 01:55:30,570
Yeah!

3359
01:55:32,830 --> 01:55:37,030
Alright, I'll name one of them a dragoon.

3360
01:55:37,770 --> 01:55:38,590
I'll get that.

3361
01:55:39,950 --> 01:55:40,450
Yeah, yeah.

3362
01:55:40,530 --> 01:55:41,050
Lock that in.

3363
01:55:41,610 --> 01:55:42,510
Alright, alright.

3364
01:55:42,710 --> 01:55:43,010
Wait.

3365
01:55:43,210 --> 01:55:43,690
Oh wait.

3366
01:55:43,790 --> 01:55:45,210
Oh, each of us gets to name one!

3367
01:55:46,090 --> 01:55:47,030
Wait, are you guys naming?

3368
01:55:47,890 --> 01:55:48,510
Okay, okay.

3369
01:55:48,630 --> 01:55:49,150
Wait, we each...

3370
01:55:49,150 --> 01:55:51,410
We all of us made puppies together!

3371
01:55:51,890 --> 01:55:53,270
We all know who the mom and dad is!

3372
01:55:53,270 --> 01:55:54,630
Oh shit, it's my puppy, Eves!

3373
01:55:55,530 --> 01:55:57,650
We know who the mom and dad is!

3374
01:55:57,830 --> 01:55:58,970
We know who the mom is!

3375
01:55:59,930 --> 01:56:00,670
We know who the dads are!

3376
01:56:00,930 --> 01:56:02,330
We each get one!

3377
01:56:06,530 --> 01:56:07,530
Guys, no!

3378
01:56:07,890 --> 01:56:10,330
My puppy will not be eagled!

3379
01:56:10,430 --> 01:56:11,250
I swear!

3380
01:56:12,190 --> 01:56:13,430
I named the puppy.

3381
01:56:13,770 --> 01:56:16,830
Okay, now four weeks old, your pups are too big for the den.

3382
01:56:17,050 --> 01:56:20,690
As they spend their day playing to increase the affinity of your family plaque.

3383
01:56:20,790 --> 01:56:22,050
If they're playful, play with them.

3384
01:56:22,130 --> 01:56:22,990
If they're hungry, feed them.

3385
01:56:23,090 --> 01:56:25,810
If they stray far from the den, go find them and carry them back.

3386
01:56:26,130 --> 01:56:27,450
Pups mostly eat meat.

3387
01:56:27,710 --> 01:56:29,530
Regurgitate it by the adults in your pack.

3388
01:56:29,930 --> 01:56:31,410
Okay, that's your job, Lily.

3389
01:56:32,210 --> 01:56:33,670
Wait, wait, wait!

3390
01:56:36,810 --> 01:56:39,390
You can do that.

3391
01:56:41,790 --> 01:56:43,770
I can't wait to do that.

3392
01:56:44,090 --> 01:56:47,210
Someone named their puppy!

3393
01:56:47,470 --> 01:56:48,970
Someone named their puppy!

3394
01:56:48,970 --> 01:56:50,190
Dirt named their puppy Dirt Junior!

3395
01:56:50,670 --> 01:56:51,670
That's my puppy!

3396
01:56:51,990 --> 01:56:52,950
Where's your puppy?

3397
01:56:53,270 --> 01:56:54,790
Dirt Junior is so cute!

3398
01:56:54,910 --> 01:56:55,750
It's like my puppy died.

3399
01:56:56,190 --> 01:56:57,010
Wait, what?

3400
01:56:57,010 --> 01:56:58,130
Wait, Aqua!

3401
01:56:58,510 --> 01:57:01,230
Okay, I'm pretty sure the fifth puppy has to be yours.

3402
01:57:02,290 --> 01:57:04,210
He's got a pretty shirt.

3403
01:57:04,910 --> 01:57:06,070
Where's my puppy?

3404
01:57:06,310 --> 01:57:07,890
Is the name not good enough?

3405
01:57:08,150 --> 01:57:08,910
Did it die?

3406
01:57:11,010 --> 01:57:11,770
Where is it?

3407
01:57:11,950 --> 01:57:12,430
No!

3408
01:57:15,230 --> 01:57:18,330
Look, I'll be sweet here and name the track.

3409
01:57:18,450 --> 01:57:22,430
Would you fucking name your shrimp puppy constipation?

3410
01:57:22,770 --> 01:57:23,690
Shrimps, remember!

3411
01:57:24,590 --> 01:57:26,450
Which streamer actually...

3412
01:57:28,870 --> 01:57:30,450
Remember who cares.

3413
01:57:30,630 --> 01:57:32,350
Remember who cares.

3414
01:57:32,350 --> 01:57:32,620
Remember who fucking cares.

3415
01:57:34,450 --> 01:57:35,530
Remember who fucking cares.

3416
01:57:35,530 --> 01:57:36,430
Come on.

3417
01:57:36,750 --> 01:57:37,890
Oh my god.

3418
01:57:38,130 --> 01:57:39,670
Chan, you like the name, right?

3419
01:57:39,710 --> 01:57:40,950
Time one if you like my name.

3420
01:57:40,990 --> 01:57:43,610
Time one if you appreciate my name.

3421
01:57:47,330 --> 01:57:48,450
That's my streamer.

3422
01:57:50,130 --> 01:57:51,770
That's my streamer.

3423
01:57:52,330 --> 01:57:56,310
I love how your puppy is the last one to come.

3424
01:57:56,350 --> 01:57:56,430
I love how your puppy is the last one to come.

3425
01:57:56,450 --> 01:57:57,250
I'm about to...

3426
01:57:57,250 --> 01:57:59,870
He lives up to his name.

3427
01:58:04,610 --> 01:58:06,370
He lives up to his name.

3428
01:58:06,430 --> 01:58:07,410
He knows what's up.

3429
01:58:08,190 --> 01:58:09,390
Wait, there's a fox!

3430
01:58:09,670 --> 01:58:10,890
Oh my god, there's danger!

3431
01:58:11,790 --> 01:58:12,490
There's a fox!

3432
01:58:12,490 --> 01:58:12,970
There's a fox!

3433
01:58:12,970 --> 01:58:13,750
It's trying to eat her baby!

3434
01:58:14,230 --> 01:58:14,770
Get him!

3435
01:58:16,030 --> 01:58:16,210
Get him!

3436
01:58:17,010 --> 01:58:18,670
Take constipation, but not the trick!

3437
01:58:21,470 --> 01:58:22,850
Don't take constipation!

3438
01:58:23,510 --> 01:58:23,950
Stop!

3439
01:58:25,210 --> 01:58:26,250
Don't take it!

3440
01:58:26,450 --> 01:58:26,510
No!

3441
01:58:26,830 --> 01:58:27,870
He's going closer!

3442
01:58:27,990 --> 01:58:28,990
Oh my god, he ran away!

3443
01:58:29,170 --> 01:58:29,950
He ran away!

3444
01:58:30,050 --> 01:58:30,390
He ran away!

3445
01:58:30,510 --> 01:58:31,030
He can't take it!

3446
01:58:31,310 --> 01:58:31,750
That's right!

3447
01:58:31,830 --> 01:58:32,310
That's right!

3448
01:58:32,350 --> 01:58:33,450
Get the... Get the hike away!

3449
01:58:34,230 --> 01:58:34,850
That's right!

3450
01:58:35,430 --> 01:58:37,930
Your pups are safe again for a moment.

3451
01:58:38,290 --> 01:58:38,730
Alright.

3452
01:58:39,290 --> 01:58:41,410
Constipation, you may stop clenching your butt cheeks.

3453
01:58:42,230 --> 01:58:43,830
You will learn later why.

3454
01:58:43,990 --> 01:58:47,070
I still can't believe it was the last one to come.

3455
01:58:47,070 --> 01:58:49,090
I still can't believe it.

3456
01:58:49,190 --> 01:58:50,530
I'm making a curse.

3457
01:58:50,550 --> 01:58:52,170
I chose my name wisely!

3458
01:58:52,170 --> 01:58:52,190
I chose my name wisely!

3459
01:58:55,030 --> 01:58:55,670
Dragoon!

3460
01:58:55,670 --> 01:58:56,310
Look at me!

3461
01:58:56,410 --> 01:58:57,510
I'm playing with you!

3462
01:58:57,890 --> 01:58:58,530
Dragoon!

3463
01:58:58,850 --> 01:59:01,090
Go play with your fucking puppy!

3464
01:59:02,710 --> 01:59:03,830
Go play with your fucking puppy!

3465
01:59:03,830 --> 01:59:04,130
Tail up!

3466
01:59:05,750 --> 01:59:08,310
I'm sick of having...

3467
01:59:08,310 --> 01:59:08,570
Yay!

3468
01:59:11,350 --> 01:59:12,450
Look at that!

3469
01:59:12,850 --> 01:59:13,950
It's so cute!

3470
01:59:14,130 --> 01:59:14,850
What the heck!

3471
01:59:15,250 --> 01:59:16,290
It's so beautiful!

3472
01:59:17,890 --> 01:59:18,850
You're beautiful!

3473
01:59:19,350 --> 01:59:20,330
We're proud!

3474
01:59:20,510 --> 01:59:21,470
We're proud!

3475
01:59:22,170 --> 01:59:23,530
You're beautiful, baby!

3476
01:59:23,550 --> 01:59:25,630
We can't breathe!

3477
01:59:26,170 --> 01:59:30,050
We worked so hard, Lily.

3478
01:59:31,110 --> 01:59:31,890
We worked so hard, Lily.

3479
01:59:31,890 --> 01:59:31,910
We worked so hard, Lily.

3480
01:59:31,910 --> 01:59:36,350
This is what we've been working for since we started this company!

3481
01:59:37,750 --> 01:59:39,530
This is what we've been working for since we started this company!

3482
01:59:39,530 --> 01:59:40,610
It's paying off!

3483
01:59:41,590 --> 01:59:43,330
It's all us, Dokie!

3484
01:59:43,410 --> 01:59:44,250
It's all us!

3485
01:59:44,850 --> 01:59:45,990
All us!

3486
01:59:46,010 --> 01:59:46,510
All us!

3487
01:59:47,050 --> 01:59:47,650
Woo!

3488
01:59:49,820 --> 01:59:50,210
Woo!

3489
01:59:50,210 --> 01:59:51,070
Noooo!

3490
01:59:51,890 --> 01:59:59,830
I knew working overtime day and night at Shrimp Goons Incorporated will pay off!

3491
02:00:01,150 --> 02:00:01,910
Yippee!

3492
02:00:02,310 --> 02:00:03,070
Yay!

3493
02:00:05,950 --> 02:00:10,790
Someone in chat just says, you are like my aunts when they heavily drink.

3494
02:00:15,230 --> 02:00:19,410
I don't know if it's a compliment or not, but thank you, thank you.

3495
02:00:20,210 --> 02:00:21,430
Oh my god, there's a puppy cam!

3496
02:00:21,710 --> 02:00:25,090
You press shift and F, you get to be the puppy!

3497
02:00:25,970 --> 02:00:27,030
Shift F.

3498
02:00:27,030 --> 02:00:27,570
Shift F.

3499
02:00:27,830 --> 02:00:29,390
Oh, puppy cam!

3500
02:00:29,790 --> 02:00:30,450
Puppy cam!

3501
02:00:30,950 --> 02:00:31,890
That's you guys!

3502
02:00:32,550 --> 02:00:33,250
Puppy cam!

3503
02:00:34,250 --> 02:00:35,290
So cute!

3504
02:00:36,330 --> 02:00:37,590
Dragoon, get away from Aqua!

3505
02:00:37,930 --> 02:00:41,290
Get away from Aqua!

3506
02:00:41,450 --> 02:00:45,850
If you're associating with anybody, it's Dirt Jr. Dirt Jr. knows what's up.

3507
02:00:46,010 --> 02:00:48,450
He's the 200 hour wolf quest bro.

3508
02:00:50,430 --> 02:00:52,030
Constipation do be walking like this.

3509
02:00:52,030 --> 02:00:53,830
Okay, get away from constipation, Dragoon.

3510
02:00:53,930 --> 02:00:56,630
Get away... that one's special!

3511
02:00:57,150 --> 02:00:58,230
I'm from constipation!

3512
02:00:59,910 --> 02:01:02,390
We got the constipation camera!

3513
02:01:02,670 --> 02:01:03,010
Yeah!

3514
02:01:05,110 --> 02:01:09,510
Dragoon, when you grow up, you will be Alpha.

3515
02:01:13,590 --> 02:01:15,430
You will be the new Alpha.

3516
02:01:15,570 --> 02:01:18,430
You will be the new Alpha, Dragoon.

3517
02:01:18,710 --> 02:01:19,750
You will be...

3518
02:01:19,750 --> 02:01:22,290
You grow up to be a constipation's boss.

3519
02:01:28,530 --> 02:01:29,050
No!

3520
02:01:30,370 --> 02:01:32,850
You're gonna be constipation's supervisor.

3521
02:01:33,250 --> 02:01:33,370
He will tell you when to poop!

3522
02:01:33,370 --> 02:01:34,470
That's when you're constipated!

3523
02:01:36,270 --> 02:01:38,430
No poop breaks until five!

3524
02:01:41,810 --> 02:01:42,630
I can't believe it.

3525
02:01:42,630 --> 02:01:43,270
How dare you poop?

3526
02:01:43,610 --> 02:01:45,310
I'm glad we opened the server.

3527
02:01:45,450 --> 02:01:47,630
I definitely think we would never figure this out.

3528
02:01:47,790 --> 02:01:48,510
Oh, we would never.

3529
02:01:48,510 --> 02:01:50,330
We would never fix it.

3530
02:01:50,430 --> 02:01:52,850
We would have had such a hard time.

3531
02:01:53,050 --> 02:01:53,950
This is...

3532
02:01:53,950 --> 02:01:54,870
Holy shit.

3533
02:01:55,150 --> 02:01:55,810
Thank god.

3534
02:01:55,830 --> 02:01:59,930
Thank god the gamers are here to save the day while we supervise.

3535
02:02:00,270 --> 02:02:01,230
Thank god.

3536
02:02:02,090 --> 02:02:03,250
Wait, we can pick up our kids?

3537
02:02:03,490 --> 02:02:04,330
How do we pick up our kids?

3538
02:02:04,750 --> 02:02:06,090
If you hold space on them.

3539
02:02:06,370 --> 02:02:07,390
Oh my god.

3540
02:02:07,710 --> 02:02:09,010
Get over here, Dragoon.

3541
02:02:10,330 --> 02:02:11,230
That's fucking right.

3542
02:02:12,610 --> 02:02:13,310
That's right.

3543
02:02:13,510 --> 02:02:14,010
That's right.

3544
02:02:14,090 --> 02:02:15,230
Stay away from that bush.

3545
02:02:15,290 --> 02:02:16,330
He ain't right.

3546
02:02:16,470 --> 02:02:17,890
Oh my god, my tail's so ugly.

3547
02:02:17,970 --> 02:02:18,430
It's like a little...

3548
02:02:18,510 --> 02:02:19,050
Rat tail.

3549
02:02:19,070 --> 02:02:20,450
Just wagging.

3550
02:02:22,240 --> 02:02:24,090
They look like fucking cats.

3551
02:02:26,070 --> 02:02:28,250
They look like cats.

3552
02:02:28,490 --> 02:02:30,270
They don't even look like wolves.

3553
02:02:30,930 --> 02:02:32,230
Oh, thank you.

3554
02:02:32,270 --> 02:02:33,410
Cut off that.

3555
02:02:33,630 --> 02:02:34,890
My hips so ugly.

3556
02:02:35,010 --> 02:02:36,270
Fuck no!

3557
02:02:37,270 --> 02:02:38,510
Come back!

3558
02:02:38,510 --> 02:02:40,050
Vang, our Uber Eats!

3559
02:02:40,090 --> 02:02:42,550
What will we do about Uber Eats?

3560
02:02:42,850 --> 02:02:46,090
Who would feed them?

3561
02:02:47,170 --> 02:02:48,850
We'll feed our puppies.

3562
02:02:49,110 --> 02:02:49,810
Come back.

3563
02:02:50,070 --> 02:02:51,390
We'll feed the children.

3564
02:02:51,690 --> 02:02:54,090
We're supervisors, not doers.

3565
02:02:57,090 --> 02:02:59,610
We have worked enough in our lives.

3566
02:02:59,730 --> 02:03:01,370
I'm gonna outcast the whole world.

3567
02:03:01,990 --> 02:03:02,450
Oh, what?

3568
02:03:02,450 --> 02:03:03,490
Attack the boobies!

3569
02:03:04,770 --> 02:03:05,990
Where is it?

3570
02:03:06,130 --> 02:03:07,230
Oh my god, there's four!

3571
02:03:07,750 --> 02:03:09,190
There's five of them!

3572
02:03:10,090 --> 02:03:10,250
What?

3573
02:03:10,290 --> 02:03:11,370
Go get them out.

3574
02:03:12,530 --> 02:03:14,050
They're attacking our boobies!

3575
02:03:14,830 --> 02:03:15,750
Come back, come back.

3576
02:03:15,750 --> 02:03:17,570
Oh no, no.

3577
02:03:17,590 --> 02:03:18,750
Vang, come back!

3578
02:03:18,870 --> 02:03:19,430
There's a wag!

3579
02:03:21,320 --> 02:03:22,780
Vang, we need you!

3580
02:03:25,600 --> 02:03:26,940
Oh my god!

3581
02:03:27,140 --> 02:03:27,920
Stay away!

3582
02:03:28,520 --> 02:03:29,780
Not the dragon horn!

3583
02:03:30,800 --> 02:03:31,360
Stop!

3584
02:03:31,360 --> 02:03:31,920
No!

3585
02:03:32,500 --> 02:03:33,920
It's okay, children!

3586
02:03:34,860 --> 02:03:36,280
Oh my god, they're so...

3587
02:03:36,280 --> 02:03:38,120
Get the fuck away from the babies!

3588
02:03:38,300 --> 02:03:39,640
Get away from the babies!

3589
02:03:41,040 --> 02:03:41,600
Go!

3590
02:03:41,940 --> 02:03:42,380
Leave!

3591
02:03:43,680 --> 02:03:44,660
For the puppies!

3592
02:03:44,820 --> 02:03:45,300
For the puppies!

3593
02:03:45,540 --> 02:03:46,300
They're in the den!

3594
02:03:46,360 --> 02:03:46,900
They're in the den!

3595
02:03:46,980 --> 02:03:47,280
They're safe!

3596
02:03:47,280 --> 02:03:47,960
They're in the den!

3597
02:03:48,080 --> 02:03:48,660
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

3598
02:03:48,920 --> 02:03:51,500
I like how Vang is just lying down.

3599
02:03:52,180 --> 02:03:57,860
I like how Vang is just chilling while there's a fucking war going on.

3600
02:03:58,300 --> 02:03:59,400
He's like, yeah, it's alright.

3601
02:03:59,920 --> 02:04:00,800
Yeah, yeah.

3602
02:04:00,980 --> 02:04:02,000
He's like, don't worry about it.

3603
02:04:02,080 --> 02:04:02,500
It's okay.

3604
02:04:02,560 --> 02:04:03,740
Don't worry about it.

3605
02:04:03,940 --> 02:04:05,000
There's so many!

3606
02:04:05,080 --> 02:04:05,260
Leave!

3607
02:04:05,380 --> 02:04:06,220
There's so many!

3608
02:04:07,140 --> 02:04:07,860
Get out of here.

3609
02:04:07,920 --> 02:04:08,040
Run!

3610
02:04:08,320 --> 02:04:08,560
Run!

3611
02:04:08,600 --> 02:04:09,100
Get out of here.

3612
02:04:09,120 --> 02:04:09,420
Run!

3613
02:04:10,600 --> 02:04:11,160
That is right.

3614
02:04:11,460 --> 02:04:12,180
They give it up.

3615
02:04:12,360 --> 02:04:12,800
Nice.

3616
02:04:13,120 --> 02:04:14,080
We did it, guys.

3617
02:04:14,100 --> 02:04:15,320
Nobody messes with us.

3618
02:04:15,460 --> 02:04:15,840
Yeah.

3619
02:04:15,840 --> 02:04:16,560
That's right.

3620
02:04:16,780 --> 02:04:17,440
That's right.

3621
02:04:17,520 --> 02:04:19,580
Come out, little babies.

3622
02:04:20,680 --> 02:04:22,000
Come out, come out!

3623
02:04:22,760 --> 02:04:25,320
Come, come to patient on school, dragons!

3624
02:04:25,580 --> 02:04:26,540
I'm also gonna have riots.

3625
02:04:26,640 --> 02:04:27,180
Thank you.

3626
02:04:27,220 --> 02:04:27,480
Yeah.

3627
02:04:27,560 --> 02:04:27,900
Hello!

3628
02:04:28,420 --> 02:04:29,460
Yes, dragons!

3629
02:04:29,740 --> 02:04:31,580
You guys live for another day!

3630
02:04:34,920 --> 02:04:37,320
That is so fucking cute!

3631
02:04:40,160 --> 02:04:41,640
When did they grow up?

3632
02:04:42,800 --> 02:04:44,260
When are you gonna- Oh my god!

3633
02:04:44,280 --> 02:04:45,180
I'm throwing up food!

3634
02:04:45,180 --> 02:04:45,900
We have work to do!

3635
02:04:46,100 --> 02:04:46,340
Oh fuck!

3636
02:04:46,340 --> 02:04:47,120
Come on, grow up!

3637
02:04:47,400 --> 02:04:49,040
Oh my god, I regurgitated food!

3638
02:04:49,480 --> 02:04:52,620
I wasn't supposed to- I don't know how that happened!

3639
02:04:53,180 --> 02:04:56,700
I just- I'm new to this.

3640
02:04:56,740 --> 02:04:57,520
It just happened.

3641
02:04:57,780 --> 02:04:58,800
Oh my God.

3642
02:04:59,080 --> 02:05:00,220
It's fatherly instinct.

3643
02:05:03,420 --> 02:05:05,020
Oh no, my instinct!

3644
02:05:05,580 --> 02:05:06,460
Oh my god.

3645
02:05:06,580 --> 02:05:08,400
My fatherly instinct!

3646
02:05:09,180 --> 02:05:09,760
Oh my God.

3647
02:05:09,800 --> 02:05:10,580
What the heck?

3648
02:05:11,960 --> 02:05:13,220
How do I...

3649
02:05:13,220 --> 02:05:15,080
Where is regurgitating from?

3650
02:05:15,080 --> 02:05:15,160
Oh my God.

3651
02:05:15,160 --> 02:05:15,560
I don't know!

3652
02:05:15,760 --> 02:05:16,980
It just happened!

3653
02:05:17,460 --> 02:05:18,580
I don't even know!

3654
02:05:18,580 --> 02:05:20,300
I can rest my chin.

3655
02:05:20,540 --> 02:05:21,520
How do I do that?

3656
02:05:21,900 --> 02:05:22,540
It just...

3657
02:05:22,540 --> 02:05:23,680
Oh, it happened again!

3658
02:05:27,860 --> 02:05:29,160
It's just happening!

3659
02:05:29,580 --> 02:05:30,660
It just keeps happening!

3660
02:05:30,700 --> 02:05:31,380
It doesn't stop!

3661
02:05:33,280 --> 02:05:36,840
Imagine just uncontrollably puke over and over.

3662
02:05:37,440 --> 02:05:39,240
Oh my god, I'm sorry!

3663
02:05:39,500 --> 02:05:41,740
Dang it, you're not supposed to see that!

3664
02:05:43,060 --> 02:05:44,860
That wasn't my job!

3665
02:05:46,300 --> 02:05:47,640
Oh my god!

3666
02:05:47,820 --> 02:05:50,420
Why don't you feed the children, Satsuki?

3667
02:05:50,740 --> 02:05:53,980
I don't have anything to throw up, I don't know!

3668
02:05:54,320 --> 02:05:55,620
How do I throw up?

3669
02:05:55,760 --> 02:05:56,460
Just press space!

3670
02:05:56,820 --> 02:05:57,500
Space bar!

3671
02:05:59,520 --> 02:06:00,880
You did it!

3672
02:06:03,020 --> 02:06:04,960
I'm so proud of you!

3673
02:06:05,500 --> 02:06:06,280
So gross!

3674
02:06:07,240 --> 02:06:09,180
You're now a father!

3675
02:06:09,860 --> 02:06:10,780
Come here!

3676
02:06:10,900 --> 02:06:11,620
Eat my vomit!

3677
02:06:11,740 --> 02:06:12,500
Come on, children!

3678
02:06:13,120 --> 02:06:14,160
Didn't I serve?

3679
02:06:14,320 --> 02:06:14,940
Dragoon, no!

3680
02:06:14,940 --> 02:06:16,240
Don't touch that Dragoon!

3681
02:06:18,900 --> 02:06:19,740
Dragoon, no!

3682
02:06:20,860 --> 02:06:23,680
Uh-uh, constipation don't wander off too far!

3683
02:06:28,600 --> 02:06:30,080
Someone's gotta kick Fang out!

3684
02:06:32,980 --> 02:06:34,620
He's like, yup!

3685
02:06:35,680 --> 02:06:37,140
Fang is just there!

3686
02:06:38,660 --> 02:06:41,000
Fang, you're not even in here anymore!

3687
02:06:41,120 --> 02:06:42,280
What are you doing?

3688
02:06:44,300 --> 02:06:45,460
Yes, I'm eating it!

3689
02:06:45,820 --> 02:06:46,980
Oh, it's raining!

3690
02:06:47,560 --> 02:06:48,420
Oh god, it's raining!

3691
02:06:48,820 --> 02:06:48,960
Don't get sick!

3692
02:06:49,920 --> 02:06:50,700
Oh no!

3693
02:06:51,760 --> 02:06:52,720
Don't get sick!

3694
02:06:53,320 --> 02:06:54,460
Wait, we have fleas?

3695
02:06:55,060 --> 02:06:56,420
I'm a six percent...

3696
02:06:56,420 --> 02:06:57,440
We have fleas?

3697
02:06:58,280 --> 02:07:00,200
Wait, how do I get rid of fleas?

3698
02:07:00,200 --> 02:07:00,360
Ew!

3699
02:07:00,860 --> 02:07:02,660
Oh no, we have fleas!

3700
02:07:02,660 --> 02:07:04,200
Okay, our pups have to roll around.

3701
02:07:04,260 --> 02:07:05,300
They have to be fifteen!

3702
02:07:05,640 --> 02:07:06,020
Okay, wait.

3703
02:07:06,120 --> 02:07:07,400
How many pounds do they have to be?

3704
02:07:07,940 --> 02:07:08,720
Fifteen pounds!

3705
02:07:09,840 --> 02:07:10,720
Who's underweight?

3706
02:07:10,720 --> 02:07:11,400
How heavy are they?

3707
02:07:12,700 --> 02:07:13,760
Who's underweight right now?

3708
02:07:14,960 --> 02:07:17,580
Wait, Dirt Junior is not... is like starving.

3709
02:07:17,920 --> 02:07:18,860
Who's not feeding...

3710
02:07:18,860 --> 02:07:21,260
Wait, who's not feeding Dirt Junior?

3711
02:07:21,560 --> 02:07:24,420
Wait, just eat the vomit, Dirt Junior!

3712
02:07:24,560 --> 02:07:25,240
Come on, man!

3713
02:07:25,360 --> 02:07:25,400
Dirt Junior, eat!

3714
02:07:27,300 --> 02:07:28,140
What do I see?

3715
02:07:28,160 --> 02:07:28,940
The puppy info?

3716
02:07:29,060 --> 02:07:29,620
Oh, pack info?

3717
02:07:29,900 --> 02:07:30,980
Yeah, it's pack info.

3718
02:07:32,100 --> 02:07:34,180
I can't believe they have to be fifteen pounds!

3719
02:07:34,420 --> 02:07:35,700
They're only five pounds!

3720
02:07:35,960 --> 02:07:38,280
Dude, they're like not growing at all!

3721
02:07:38,360 --> 02:07:38,960
What do you mean?

3722
02:07:39,040 --> 02:07:39,840
Oh my god!

3723
02:07:40,420 --> 02:07:40,900
Eat!

3724
02:07:41,380 --> 02:07:42,500
Okay, I'm gonna eat too.

3725
02:07:42,660 --> 02:07:43,740
So I can feed...

3726
02:07:43,740 --> 02:07:44,340
I'm gonna feed the puppies.

3727
02:07:45,640 --> 02:07:50,980
Each puppy has a favorite wolf that they like to socialize with more often.

3728
02:07:51,060 --> 02:07:52,700
And I'm not on anyone's list!

3729
02:07:52,920 --> 02:07:53,860
Not even my own!

3730
02:07:54,760 --> 02:07:56,600
Not even your own child?

3731
02:07:56,920 --> 02:07:57,100
I am!

3732
02:07:57,140 --> 02:07:57,740
I am!

3733
02:07:57,740 --> 02:07:58,200
Oh shit!

3734
02:07:58,280 --> 02:07:58,880
Okay, okay.

3735
02:07:59,000 --> 02:08:00,720
I was gonna say, as your own child.

3736
02:08:01,020 --> 02:08:03,140
I'm like, how Dirt claimed two of them.

3737
02:08:04,260 --> 02:08:06,080
Dirt was like, yeah, I'm getting both of them.

3738
02:08:07,160 --> 02:08:08,960
I can't believe it!

3739
02:08:10,580 --> 02:08:11,100
Alright.

3740
02:08:11,100 --> 02:08:12,140
Okay, eat.

3741
02:08:12,960 --> 02:08:13,400
Eat.

3742
02:08:14,240 --> 02:08:15,320
Dragoon, why are you sleeping?

3743
02:08:15,540 --> 02:08:15,980
Dragoon.

3744
02:08:17,220 --> 02:08:18,560
Dragoon, socialize with me.

3745
02:08:19,460 --> 02:08:19,900
Socialize?

3746
02:08:21,120 --> 02:08:22,280
Socialize with me now!

3747
02:08:25,200 --> 02:08:26,500
Come on, play with me!

3748
02:08:26,900 --> 02:08:27,340
Wee!

3749
02:08:27,460 --> 02:08:28,180
Play with me!

3750
02:08:28,860 --> 02:08:31,760
What if I take a break from socializing with your pups?

3751
02:08:31,840 --> 02:08:32,500
Why would I do that?

3752
02:08:32,900 --> 02:08:33,340
Wait!

3753
02:08:33,800 --> 02:08:34,720
What the fuck?

3754
02:08:34,740 --> 02:08:34,960
What?

3755
02:08:35,120 --> 02:08:36,420
Don't kill Lily, love child!

3756
02:08:36,740 --> 02:08:37,620
Who is this?

3757
02:08:37,700 --> 02:08:38,800
They peed on my kid!

3758
02:08:39,020 --> 02:08:39,140
What?

3759
02:08:39,320 --> 02:08:40,760
They peed on my kid!

3760
02:08:41,520 --> 02:08:42,240
What?

3761
02:08:43,160 --> 02:08:45,300
They peed on my child!

3762
02:08:45,820 --> 02:08:47,100
What the heck?

3763
02:08:47,380 --> 02:08:48,720
That's fucked up!

3764
02:08:48,720 --> 02:08:50,500
They peed on my child!

3765
02:08:51,620 --> 02:08:53,840
You can't do that, do you?

3766
02:08:53,900 --> 02:08:54,840
You're so gross!

3767
02:08:54,940 --> 02:08:55,560
What the heck?

3768
02:08:55,900 --> 02:08:57,040
That's fucked up!

3769
02:08:57,160 --> 02:08:59,280
This person peed on my child!

3770
02:08:59,740 --> 02:09:02,120
Bro, their bio is puppy in bio.

3771
02:09:04,520 --> 02:09:05,980
Their bio is what?

3772
02:09:06,220 --> 02:09:08,320
Their bio is puppy in bio.

3773
02:09:08,320 --> 02:09:09,340
Puppy in bio.

3774
02:09:13,840 --> 02:09:15,720
What the heck happened?

3775
02:09:16,490 --> 02:09:21,120
It's just cause Fang got kicked out and this person sniped this bot.

3776
02:09:21,460 --> 02:09:24,040
They were waiting this whole time to do this.

3777
02:09:24,080 --> 02:09:25,040
This whole time.

3778
02:09:25,480 --> 02:09:31,460
Alright, TokiLilyLoveChild, go and adopt Fang's child and rename them.

3779
02:09:33,940 --> 02:09:34,780
Rename them.

3780
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:36,240
They're your kids now.

3781
02:09:36,720 --> 02:09:39,040
You can have that child.

3782
02:09:39,040 --> 02:09:40,840
Go rename your kid.

3783
02:09:43,220 --> 02:09:44,680
I don't know which one.

3784
02:09:44,760 --> 02:09:46,740
Choose a wise name.

3785
02:09:47,360 --> 02:09:50,480
I don't know if it's Ivy or Aqua.

3786
02:09:50,720 --> 02:09:52,120
I don't know whose child it is.

3787
02:09:52,260 --> 02:09:53,340
But you'll figure it out.

3788
02:09:54,220 --> 02:09:55,780
You got this, don't worry.

3789
02:09:57,780 --> 02:09:58,960
Dragoon, look at me.

3790
02:09:59,660 --> 02:10:02,740
I don't want to take a break from socializing with my child.

3791
02:10:03,320 --> 02:10:04,720
Ryan, who does that?

3792
02:10:05,020 --> 02:10:09,020
My child has to be socially aware of what's going on.

3793
02:10:09,040 --> 02:10:12,520
I don't want him to be anti-social.

3794
02:10:14,140 --> 02:10:15,500
Please socialize.

3795
02:10:15,560 --> 02:10:16,220
Come on.

3796
02:10:17,540 --> 02:10:20,140
Don't be a freak, Dragoon.

3797
02:10:20,220 --> 02:10:22,880
I need you to be well adjusted to society.

3798
02:10:26,860 --> 02:10:28,980
Can somebody feed the children?

3799
02:10:29,180 --> 02:10:32,380
I don't have enough food in my stomach to regurgitate.

3800
02:10:34,960 --> 02:10:37,400
Can someone feed the kids?

3801
02:10:37,400 --> 02:10:40,280
I don't want to feed the kids.

3802
02:10:40,560 --> 02:10:41,680
Can someone just...

3803
02:10:42,660 --> 02:10:44,980
Guys, stop howling.

3804
02:10:45,060 --> 02:10:46,780
We need you to feed the children.

3805
02:10:49,900 --> 02:10:51,520
Can I throw up some more?

3806
02:10:51,800 --> 02:10:54,200
Wait, Ivy's gonna die from lack of sleep.

3807
02:10:55,620 --> 02:10:56,480
Okay, we gotta sleep.

3808
02:10:56,480 --> 02:10:57,160
We're gonna have to sleep?

3809
02:10:57,480 --> 02:10:57,560
Okay.

3810
02:10:57,620 --> 02:10:58,480
Yeah, we gotta sleep.

3811
02:10:58,580 --> 02:10:59,540
It's sleepy time.

3812
02:11:02,900 --> 02:11:03,940
Guys, it's okay.

3813
02:11:03,980 --> 02:11:05,640
The kids will be fine and we all just sleep.

3814
02:11:05,920 --> 02:11:06,400
Right?

3815
02:11:06,400 --> 02:11:08,520
They won't get abducted.

3816
02:11:08,520 --> 02:11:11,360
They won't get abducted when we're all just sleeping around.

3817
02:11:14,640 --> 02:11:16,620
It's like an eagle cacaw.

3818
02:11:16,960 --> 02:11:20,120
Yeah, the eagle just comes in and takes away...

3819
02:11:20,120 --> 02:11:21,100
Just loops one.

3820
02:11:22,080 --> 02:11:23,400
Oh, it's just sleeping.

3821
02:11:26,960 --> 02:11:27,800
Don't worry.

3822
02:11:28,180 --> 02:11:28,780
We'll be fine.

3823
02:11:29,000 --> 02:11:30,220
We'll be fine.

3824
02:11:30,620 --> 02:11:31,800
Guys, sleep.

3825
02:11:31,840 --> 02:11:34,280
Mother, what have you forsaken me?

3826
02:11:34,360 --> 02:11:35,420
The eagle mother.

3827
02:11:35,420 --> 02:11:35,880
Father.

3828
02:11:37,440 --> 02:11:38,440
Father, help.

3829
02:11:40,060 --> 02:11:40,660
Please.

3830
02:11:41,180 --> 02:11:42,340
Father, please.

3831
02:11:42,440 --> 02:11:43,160
There's an eagle.

3832
02:11:43,320 --> 02:11:43,980
Wake up.

3833
02:11:44,240 --> 02:11:45,260
Wake up.

3834
02:11:45,820 --> 02:11:46,700
Wake up.

3835
02:11:46,700 --> 02:11:47,580
Please wake up.

3836
02:11:47,720 --> 02:11:49,460
Who's that wolf behind us that's not sleeping?

3837
02:11:49,760 --> 02:11:52,400
Is that Doki, Lily, Love Child, Puppy and Bile?

3838
02:11:52,560 --> 02:11:52,960
Is he?

3839
02:11:53,360 --> 02:11:56,100
We have to... we have to... investigating, investigating.

3840
02:11:56,800 --> 02:11:57,400
Sleep.

3841
02:11:58,460 --> 02:11:59,420
We're sleeping.

3842
02:12:02,720 --> 02:12:04,600
The alpha requests sleep.

3843
02:12:05,760 --> 02:12:08,380
The alpha requests sleep.

3844
02:12:08,380 --> 02:12:09,480
The alpha requests sleep.

3845
02:12:09,480 --> 02:12:09,720
The alpha requests sleep.

3846
02:12:09,720 --> 02:12:11,080
Excuse me, sir.

3847
02:12:11,200 --> 02:12:12,740
Could you please lay down and sleep?

3848
02:12:12,820 --> 02:12:13,340
Thank you.

3849
02:12:13,340 --> 02:12:13,780
Thank you.

3850
02:12:15,880 --> 02:12:16,780
Oh, no.

3851
02:12:16,980 --> 02:12:19,540
It'd be so fucked up if an eagle just swoops in right now.

3852
02:12:19,740 --> 02:12:21,600
While I'm looking at the children.

3853
02:12:24,900 --> 02:12:25,780
Where's Dragoon?

3854
02:12:26,620 --> 02:12:27,060
Dragoon?

3855
02:12:27,120 --> 02:12:27,800
Where's Dragoon?

3856
02:12:27,820 --> 02:12:30,640
Wait, he actually got eaten by an eagle.

3857
02:12:30,900 --> 02:12:31,940
Oh, there's Dragoon.

3858
02:12:32,040 --> 02:12:32,660
Oh, there he is.

3859
02:12:32,740 --> 02:12:33,320
Okay, they're sleeping.

3860
02:12:33,680 --> 02:12:34,340
Oh, thank god.

3861
02:12:34,340 --> 02:12:35,000
They're in... How the heck did you get inside?

3862
02:12:35,000 --> 02:12:35,500
They're inside.

3863
02:12:35,620 --> 02:12:36,420
Just press spacebar.

3864
02:12:37,440 --> 02:12:37,800
Oh.

3865
02:12:39,080 --> 02:12:40,200
Alright, just press spacebar.

3866
02:12:40,220 --> 02:12:41,020
You can see the kids.

3867
02:12:41,780 --> 02:12:42,800
Oh, they're so cute.

3868
02:12:43,000 --> 02:12:43,600
What the heck?

3869
02:12:43,600 --> 02:12:44,560
They're all so cute.

3870
02:12:46,320 --> 02:12:47,400
Alright, let's see.

3871
02:12:47,720 --> 02:12:48,960
We need...

3872
02:12:48,960 --> 02:12:51,020
Alright, they are seven pounds.

3873
02:12:51,180 --> 02:12:51,940
They're halfway there.

3874
02:12:52,620 --> 02:12:53,260
Guys, feed.

3875
02:12:53,520 --> 02:12:54,440
We need to hunt.

3876
02:12:54,940 --> 02:12:56,240
Alright, Lily, we gotta hunt.

3877
02:12:56,260 --> 02:12:57,220
We need a little...

3878
02:12:58,040 --> 02:12:58,760
Arcand regurgitate.

3879
02:12:58,900 --> 02:12:59,460
Yeah, we have to hunt.

3880
02:12:59,620 --> 02:12:59,860
Okay.

3881
02:13:00,080 --> 02:13:00,080
Okay.

3882
02:13:00,100 --> 02:13:00,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3883
02:13:00,400 --> 02:13:00,760
Alright.

3884
02:13:01,560 --> 02:13:02,040
Let's hunt.

3885
02:13:02,080 --> 02:13:02,360
Let's hunt.

3886
02:13:02,460 --> 02:13:03,220
Okay, I'm looking...

3887
02:13:03,220 --> 02:13:03,380
Let's see.

3888
02:13:03,860 --> 02:13:05,420
I'm in scent mode now.

3889
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:06,820
Okay, I'm sniffing.

3890
02:13:06,840 --> 02:13:07,240
Follow me.

3891
02:13:07,280 --> 02:13:07,620
Follow me.

3892
02:13:08,520 --> 02:13:09,100
Follow me.

3893
02:13:09,200 --> 02:13:09,980
You're picking something up?

3894
02:13:10,160 --> 02:13:11,140
I'm picking something up.

3895
02:13:12,020 --> 02:13:13,380
Okay, I went the wrong way.

3896
02:13:13,520 --> 02:13:14,180
I'm behind you.

3897
02:13:14,220 --> 02:13:14,660
I'm behind you.

3898
02:13:14,660 --> 02:13:15,000
Don't worry.

3899
02:13:15,740 --> 02:13:16,260
I went the wrong way.

3900
02:13:16,260 --> 02:13:17,180
Walking the wrong way with you.

3901
02:13:17,280 --> 02:13:17,620
It's this way.

3902
02:13:17,700 --> 02:13:18,120
It's this way.

3903
02:13:18,240 --> 02:13:18,340
You got this.

3904
02:13:21,020 --> 02:13:21,600
Follow me.

3905
02:13:21,640 --> 02:13:21,940
Follow me.

3906
02:13:21,940 --> 02:13:23,080
I know exactly where I'm going.

3907
02:13:26,800 --> 02:13:27,660
That's the wrong doki.

3908
02:13:27,720 --> 02:13:28,940
I found the wrong doki.

3909
02:13:29,740 --> 02:13:30,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3910
02:13:30,200 --> 02:13:30,200
It's here.

3911
02:13:30,200 --> 02:13:32,920
Are you following the doki Lily love channel?

3912
02:13:32,920 --> 02:13:34,460
Yeah, I was like way in.

3913
02:13:35,820 --> 02:13:36,540
Wrong doki.

3914
02:13:37,880 --> 02:13:38,360
It's okay.

3915
02:13:38,460 --> 02:13:39,240
I'm picking up the scent.

3916
02:13:40,920 --> 02:13:41,800
Where are you?

3917
02:13:41,840 --> 02:13:42,560
Where are you little rabbit?

3918
02:13:43,180 --> 02:13:43,940
Where are you?

3919
02:13:45,400 --> 02:13:45,980
Oh my god.

3920
02:13:45,980 --> 02:13:46,620
Where's the rabbit?

3921
02:13:47,300 --> 02:13:48,860
Where the fuck did the rabbit go?

3922
02:13:50,140 --> 02:13:51,420
I can't find the rabbit.

3923
02:13:51,580 --> 02:13:51,600
Oh!

3924
02:13:51,820 --> 02:13:52,180
Where?

3925
02:13:54,390 --> 02:13:54,990
I see.

3926
02:13:55,050 --> 02:13:55,590
I see elk.

3927
02:13:55,610 --> 02:13:55,990
I see it.

3928
02:13:56,090 --> 02:13:56,190
But there's a wolf.

3929
02:13:56,390 --> 02:13:57,210
I can't eat the wolf.

3930
02:13:57,450 --> 02:13:58,630
But there's elk here.

3931
02:13:58,670 --> 02:13:59,210
There's elk here.

3932
02:13:59,810 --> 02:14:00,170
Elk?

3933
02:14:00,250 --> 02:14:00,710
Oh, it should be.

3934
02:14:00,730 --> 02:14:01,290
Can I have an elk?

3935
02:14:01,330 --> 02:14:01,690
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3936
02:14:01,970 --> 02:14:03,470
That's a lot of food that we can...

3937
02:14:03,470 --> 02:14:05,610
That we can like feed the children.

3938
02:14:06,610 --> 02:14:07,170
I'm coming.

3939
02:14:07,170 --> 02:14:07,170
I'm coming.

3940
02:14:07,170 --> 02:14:09,050
We can't puke so much.

3941
02:14:09,050 --> 02:14:10,390
We can't have so much bum.

3942
02:14:12,590 --> 02:14:13,570
I'm going up.

3943
02:14:13,690 --> 02:14:14,570
I'm getting up there.

3944
02:14:14,710 --> 02:14:15,610
They're so fast.

3945
02:14:15,950 --> 02:14:17,810
Why didn't I invest in speed?

3946
02:14:19,630 --> 02:14:21,650
Why didn't I invest in speed?

3947
02:14:22,390 --> 02:14:24,110
Should have went with speed.

3948
02:14:26,310 --> 02:14:28,270
It was a mistake.

3949
02:14:29,810 --> 02:14:31,230
They're too fast.

3950
02:14:33,470 --> 02:14:33,990
Oh my god.

3951
02:14:34,050 --> 02:14:37,610
I swear it's gonna take me like 20 years to get to these deers.

3952
02:14:38,390 --> 02:14:39,670
They're so quick.

3953
02:14:40,870 --> 02:14:42,690
I'm going so fast.

3954
02:14:43,510 --> 02:14:44,310
They're not tired.

3955
02:14:44,310 --> 02:14:45,090
We'll outrun them eventually.

3956
02:14:45,390 --> 02:14:46,570
We just have to outlast them.

3957
02:14:46,610 --> 02:14:46,850
Easy.

3958
02:14:46,970 --> 02:14:47,330
Oh, that's true.

3959
02:14:47,390 --> 02:14:47,670
That's true.

3960
02:14:47,690 --> 02:14:48,030
That's true.

3961
02:14:48,250 --> 02:14:51,770
There's no way these deers can run forever.

3962
02:14:51,990 --> 02:14:53,690
But you have like stamina investment.

3963
02:14:53,910 --> 02:14:54,490
You got this.

3964
02:14:54,650 --> 02:14:55,110
You got your stamina.

3965
02:14:55,110 --> 02:14:55,770
There's no way.

3966
02:14:55,910 --> 02:14:58,470
I hope somebody's protecting the cubs while we're gone.

3967
02:14:58,690 --> 02:14:59,490
I hope...

3968
02:15:00,230 --> 02:15:02,230
We come back, no cubs.

3969
02:15:04,290 --> 02:15:05,290
I hope...

3970
02:15:05,290 --> 02:15:05,750
I hope...

3971
02:15:05,750 --> 02:15:06,190
Oh god.

3972
02:15:06,370 --> 02:15:07,450
I hope the...

3973
02:15:07,450 --> 02:15:09,970
I hope the kids are okay.

3974
02:15:12,430 --> 02:15:13,570
Please be okay.

3975
02:15:13,670 --> 02:15:14,670
Please be okay.

3976
02:15:14,670 --> 02:15:14,690
Please be okay.

3977
02:15:15,050 --> 02:15:16,130
We're hunted.

3978
02:15:16,130 --> 02:15:18,630
I like somebody who's like spamming eagles.

3979
02:15:19,450 --> 02:15:20,870
I gave up.

3980
02:15:21,030 --> 02:15:21,830
They are too...

3981
02:15:21,830 --> 02:15:22,190
Kaka!

3982
02:15:22,410 --> 02:15:22,850
Kaka!

3983
02:15:23,070 --> 02:15:23,890
Oh, there's a...

3984
02:15:23,890 --> 02:15:24,550
There's a...

3985
02:15:24,550 --> 02:15:25,170
Freedom eagles.

3986
02:15:25,490 --> 02:15:26,130
Freedom.

3987
02:15:26,230 --> 02:15:27,590
Welcome to America.

3988
02:15:29,230 --> 02:15:30,050
This is America.

3989
02:15:30,490 --> 02:15:31,450
Oh my god.

3990
02:15:31,450 --> 02:15:32,070
Oh, I'm catching up.

3991
02:15:32,150 --> 02:15:32,930
There's a bear!

3992
02:15:34,110 --> 02:15:34,590
No!

3993
02:15:34,810 --> 02:15:35,950
Somebody save our kids!

3994
02:15:36,650 --> 02:15:38,590
Guys, there's a bear on our kids!

3995
02:15:38,990 --> 02:15:39,750
What the heck?

3996
02:15:40,110 --> 02:15:41,730
Is there anybody near?

3997
02:15:42,990 --> 02:15:43,690
Oh, they're back.

3998
02:15:43,930 --> 02:15:44,730
There's people near.

3999
02:15:45,170 --> 02:15:45,870
It's okay.

4000
02:15:46,050 --> 02:15:46,690
It's okay.

4001
02:15:46,810 --> 02:15:47,650
We've had our babysitters.

4002
02:15:48,090 --> 02:15:48,750
Our bear.

4003
02:15:49,070 --> 02:15:49,830
The bear.

4004
02:15:49,870 --> 02:15:50,310
Oh shit.

4005
02:15:50,770 --> 02:15:52,590
We're coming back, children!

4006
02:15:53,070 --> 02:15:54,010
Oh my god.

4007
02:15:55,390 --> 02:15:56,410
There's a bear!

4008
02:15:56,690 --> 02:15:58,370
I'm so far from home!

4009
02:15:58,550 --> 02:15:59,090
What the heck?

4010
02:15:59,090 --> 02:15:59,410
Okay, wait, wait.

4011
02:15:59,530 --> 02:16:00,090
There's like...

4012
02:16:00,090 --> 02:16:01,090
I got food though.

4013
02:16:01,150 --> 02:16:02,110
I'm gonna eat real fast.

4014
02:16:02,490 --> 02:16:02,970
Okay.

4015
02:16:03,990 --> 02:16:05,430
My children are dying.

4016
02:16:05,510 --> 02:16:05,990
However...

4017
02:16:05,990 --> 02:16:08,030
Anyway, Daddy's hungry.

4018
02:16:09,810 --> 02:16:10,290
Sorry.

4019
02:16:10,550 --> 02:16:12,330
Daddy's a little hungry right now.

4020
02:16:13,570 --> 02:16:14,830
Just a little hungry.

4021
02:16:15,050 --> 02:16:15,310
Oh!

4022
02:16:15,410 --> 02:16:16,110
Oh, they did it!

4023
02:16:16,130 --> 02:16:16,490
They did it!

4024
02:16:16,510 --> 02:16:17,410
They fended off the bear!

4025
02:16:18,270 --> 02:16:18,710
Oh!

4026
02:16:18,850 --> 02:16:19,570
Oh my god.

4027
02:16:19,630 --> 02:16:20,130
I knew.

4028
02:16:20,210 --> 02:16:20,690
I knew.

4029
02:16:20,950 --> 02:16:22,990
The shrimp goons could do it.

4030
02:16:23,070 --> 02:16:25,030
Dude, we were so far away from them!

4031
02:16:25,250 --> 02:16:25,790
Yeah, we...

4032
02:16:25,790 --> 02:16:27,350
Dude, those kids we're fucking dead.

4033
02:16:27,450 --> 02:16:28,530
We're so far away.

4034
02:16:30,170 --> 02:16:32,710
Yeah, thank god for the shrimp goons.

4035
02:16:32,750 --> 02:16:32,950
They are gone.

4036
02:16:32,950 --> 02:16:33,450
Because we're only alive, and we have nowhere to pay money.

4037
02:16:33,450 --> 02:16:35,330
Definitely our kids would have been gone.

4038
02:16:37,610 --> 02:16:41,610
Dude, can you imagine all this work just for them to be gone?

4039
02:16:41,710 --> 02:16:43,490
Because we killed a freaking deer.

4040
02:16:43,910 --> 02:16:46,950
We didn't even get the deer, that's the worst part!

4041
02:16:47,510 --> 02:16:48,810
I was so close!

4042
02:16:49,510 --> 02:16:50,690
Wait, I'm sniffing something.

4043
02:16:50,970 --> 02:16:51,250
Oh, rabbit.

4044
02:16:51,250 --> 02:16:51,570
You sniffing something?

4045
02:16:52,310 --> 02:16:52,490
Alright.

4046
02:16:53,170 --> 02:16:56,930
I'm just gonna hope that like fucking food comes out.

4047
02:16:58,590 --> 02:17:00,270
Food just jumps into your mouth.

4048
02:17:00,270 --> 02:17:00,830
Yeah, yeah.

4049
02:17:00,970 --> 02:17:04,910
I'm just hoping like somebody just wants to, you know, they just don't want...

4050
02:17:04,910 --> 02:17:06,610
Wait, wait, I found a herd!

4051
02:17:07,010 --> 02:17:07,990
I found a herd!

4052
02:17:08,410 --> 02:17:09,970
Wait, I don't think I'm far from you.

4053
02:17:10,110 --> 02:17:11,390
Oh, wait, shit, I am far.

4054
02:17:11,450 --> 02:17:13,510
Okay, it's okay, it's okay, I found out.

4055
02:17:13,830 --> 02:17:14,350
I'm on my way, I'm on my way.

4056
02:17:15,530 --> 02:17:16,850
I found a herd of deer.

4057
02:17:17,010 --> 02:17:17,870
Oh my god, we're...

4058
02:17:17,870 --> 02:17:19,210
The kids are gonna eat so well!

4059
02:17:20,970 --> 02:17:21,330
Oh!

4060
02:17:21,450 --> 02:17:22,650
I'm on my way, I'm on my way!

4061
02:17:22,650 --> 02:17:22,830
No, not this way!

4062
02:17:22,970 --> 02:17:23,610
Okay, fuck it.

4063
02:17:24,890 --> 02:17:25,850
Get deer faster!

4064
02:17:32,460 --> 02:17:33,160
Four kids!

4065
02:17:35,100 --> 02:17:36,200
Okay, okay, I'm getting him.

4066
02:17:36,420 --> 02:17:37,400
He's like half HP.

4067
02:17:39,420 --> 02:17:40,800
Oh no, he's so far.

4068
02:17:40,880 --> 02:17:42,500
Oh, I think I see you from like the distance.

4069
02:17:42,580 --> 02:17:43,120
Holy shit.

4070
02:17:43,140 --> 02:17:44,220
I actually see you.

4071
02:17:44,440 --> 02:17:45,220
No way!

4072
02:17:45,480 --> 02:17:45,920
What?

4073
02:17:46,160 --> 02:17:47,480
From the distance.

4074
02:17:50,140 --> 02:17:52,900
I saw something like run down the hill.

4075
02:17:53,200 --> 02:17:53,980
My jaw!

4076
02:17:54,100 --> 02:17:54,880
I broke my jaw!

4077
02:17:55,620 --> 02:17:58,200
Lily, I need you to tag out!

4078
02:17:58,720 --> 02:18:00,820
I need you to tag out with me!

4079
02:18:00,840 --> 02:18:01,840
I broke my jaw!

4080
02:18:01,920 --> 02:18:02,280
I'll tag you, I'll tag you!

4081
02:18:02,680 --> 02:18:04,400
Oh shit, I'm so far still.

4082
02:18:05,100 --> 02:18:06,480
I'm so far!

4083
02:18:08,800 --> 02:18:10,980
Okay, it's a really big deer.

4084
02:18:12,720 --> 02:18:13,660
Alright, don't worry.

4085
02:18:14,280 --> 02:18:15,280
He's almost dead.

4086
02:18:16,100 --> 02:18:17,720
We gotta bring this food over.

4087
02:18:18,480 --> 02:18:20,400
We gotta bring the food over.

4088
02:18:20,640 --> 02:18:20,800
We gotta bring the food over.

4089
02:18:22,200 --> 02:18:22,680
Okay.

4090
02:18:22,920 --> 02:18:24,000
I got him, I got him!

4091
02:18:24,120 --> 02:18:24,120
Holy shit!

4092
02:18:24,840 --> 02:18:26,020
Yo, let's go!

4093
02:18:26,240 --> 02:18:26,940
Let's go, let's go!

4094
02:18:26,980 --> 02:18:27,500
Let's feed the children!

4095
02:18:28,100 --> 02:18:29,960
Okay, I'm gonna go eat this real fast.

4096
02:18:30,860 --> 02:18:32,640
We have to eat a lot?

4097
02:18:32,640 --> 02:18:33,800
Yeah, we have to eat a lot.

4098
02:18:34,620 --> 02:18:35,960
Sasuke, come over here!

4099
02:18:36,620 --> 02:18:37,580
Eat your elk!

4100
02:18:39,020 --> 02:18:39,760
I'm coming!

4101
02:18:40,560 --> 02:18:41,620
You gotta be full!

4102
02:18:43,260 --> 02:18:45,760
Do not- I swear to God- Do not pee on this deer.

4103
02:18:46,060 --> 02:18:46,740
I swear!

4104
02:18:48,420 --> 02:18:49,240
I would never.

4105
02:18:51,860 --> 02:18:53,400
I swear to God.

4106
02:18:53,820 --> 02:18:54,840
I would never.

4107
02:18:55,020 --> 02:18:55,520
What the heck?

4108
02:18:55,720 --> 02:18:56,520
I would never.

4109
02:18:56,740 --> 02:18:59,040
I do not trust you right now.

4110
02:18:59,660 --> 02:19:00,740
Don't worry, children!

4111
02:19:02,660 --> 02:19:04,560
Papa's got some food in the stomach!

4112
02:19:05,780 --> 02:19:06,200
Papa's got some food in the stomach!

4113
02:19:06,200 --> 02:19:07,100
Don't worry, dragon!

4114
02:19:08,020 --> 02:19:09,160
Okay, I think I'm full.

4115
02:19:09,220 --> 02:19:09,640
I will feed.

4116
02:19:12,160 --> 02:19:14,220
Okay, I'm- Oh, I can eat more!

4117
02:19:14,380 --> 02:19:15,200
Oh shit, let's go!

4118
02:19:15,320 --> 02:19:16,680
Yeah, keep eating until you're full!

4119
02:19:17,800 --> 02:19:18,900
Okay, I'm full.

4120
02:19:19,080 --> 02:19:20,300
I'll take a piece of meat.

4121
02:19:21,940 --> 02:19:23,780
Yo, I got a big piece!

4122
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:24,380
Let's go!

4123
02:19:26,020 --> 02:19:27,640
Take it to feed the rest of the pack!

4124
02:19:27,640 --> 02:19:27,920
Take it to feed the rest of the pack!

4125
02:19:29,060 --> 02:19:29,540
Yeah!

4126
02:19:30,360 --> 02:19:39,020
It's nice that you actually cared about like the rest of the pack because I just- I just get full and then- I was like, alright, I'm full now.

4127
02:19:39,040 --> 02:19:39,700
Let me go over.

4128
02:19:40,420 --> 02:19:40,900
Adios.

4129
02:19:42,460 --> 02:19:43,840
I did my job.

4130
02:19:44,360 --> 02:19:45,140
Feeding myself.

4131
02:19:47,420 --> 02:19:48,720
Someone had to do it!

4132
02:19:48,760 --> 02:19:50,080
These interns ate shit!

4133
02:19:52,040 --> 02:19:54,560
They saved our children, but come on, man.

4134
02:19:54,700 --> 02:19:55,080
Children!

4135
02:19:56,040 --> 02:19:56,680
Papa's here!

4136
02:19:57,440 --> 02:19:58,460
I swear to God.

4137
02:19:59,040 --> 02:20:03,160
Kids don't- if you socialize with my kid too much, I swear to God.

4138
02:20:06,100 --> 02:20:07,680
They're stealing our children!

4139
02:20:08,580 --> 02:20:10,280
The better dragon!

4140
02:20:10,600 --> 02:20:14,520
Who the fuck- Feed the child tra- The better dragon!

4141
02:20:15,060 --> 02:20:18,460
Wait, they're fucking- Wait, what the heck?

4142
02:20:18,740 --> 02:20:20,760
Wait, I haven't fed the kids yet!

4143
02:20:22,860 --> 02:20:23,800
I'm trying to feed.

4144
02:20:24,780 --> 02:20:25,660
Alright, there we go.

4145
02:20:25,820 --> 02:20:27,820
No, don't go back to the game!

4146
02:20:29,040 --> 02:20:29,660
I'm being attacked!

4147
02:20:30,040 --> 02:20:31,300
Where is the- Where is it?

4148
02:20:31,420 --> 02:20:31,540
Where?

4149
02:20:32,260 --> 02:20:33,420
Oh, I see them!

4150
02:20:33,500 --> 02:20:33,840
I see them!

4151
02:20:33,860 --> 02:20:34,680
They're right behind me!

4152
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:38,120
Okay, you guys- You guys go protect.

4153
02:20:38,260 --> 02:20:39,660
I'm just gonna give them more food.

4154
02:20:40,500 --> 02:20:41,060
That's right.

4155
02:20:41,100 --> 02:20:41,520
That's right.

4156
02:20:41,640 --> 02:20:42,740
Oh, they already gave up.

4157
02:20:42,820 --> 02:20:43,420
That was fast.

4158
02:20:43,600 --> 02:20:44,180
Wow, we did it.

4159
02:20:44,460 --> 02:20:44,820
Wow.

4160
02:20:45,360 --> 02:20:46,500
Wow, we're so good at this.

4161
02:20:46,960 --> 02:20:49,280
Yeah, alright.

4162
02:20:50,000 --> 02:20:50,560
Come out.

4163
02:20:50,760 --> 02:20:51,540
Come out and eat.

4164
02:20:52,380 --> 02:20:52,740
Eat!

4165
02:20:54,040 --> 02:20:55,320
Come here, constipation.

4166
02:20:57,040 --> 02:20:57,400
Eat.

4167
02:20:59,040 --> 02:20:59,980
I'm gonna be a fresh worm for you.

4168
02:21:01,300 --> 02:21:03,060
Shut the fuck up.

4169
02:21:06,540 --> 02:21:07,640
Beautiful, beautiful.

4170
02:21:12,960 --> 02:21:13,520
Better

4171
02:21:17,960 --> 02:21:21,820
dragon is like- That's like 8.6 pounds.

4172
02:21:22,000 --> 02:21:23,360
What were you doing?

4173
02:21:25,500 --> 02:21:27,060
Wait, what's the rest of them?

4174
02:21:27,340 --> 02:21:28,280
Mine's 8 pounds.

4175
02:21:28,620 --> 02:21:29,840
So, like, he's okay.

4176
02:21:29,840 --> 02:21:32,800
Wait, he's growing big!

4177
02:21:32,980 --> 02:21:33,140
How?

4178
02:21:33,360 --> 02:21:33,780
What the heck?

4179
02:21:33,940 --> 02:21:34,840
Wait, what's yours?

4180
02:21:35,100 --> 02:21:36,700
Yours is 7.9?

4181
02:21:37,800 --> 02:21:39,200
Someone's not taking care of their kids.

4182
02:21:39,540 --> 02:21:41,560
I might have to call wolf support.

4183
02:21:42,100 --> 02:21:43,240
He's constipated, okay?

4184
02:21:43,340 --> 02:21:44,940
I'm gonna call wolf support on you.

4185
02:21:45,560 --> 02:21:47,380
That's malnourishment right there.

4186
02:21:47,660 --> 02:21:49,120
Please don't take away from me.

4187
02:21:49,140 --> 02:21:50,600
Don't call wolf support, please.

4188
02:21:51,100 --> 02:21:53,560
I'm gonna call wolf support.

4189
02:21:53,760 --> 02:21:54,720
Good luck with...

4190
02:21:54,720 --> 02:21:55,360
No!

4191
02:21:58,720 --> 02:22:01,200
Don't take away my constipation, please!

4192
02:22:04,700 --> 02:22:06,660
I love it so much!

4193
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:08,800
Ma'am?

4194
02:22:08,900 --> 02:22:11,380
How many times are you feeding your children?

4195
02:22:13,240 --> 02:22:14,780
Like, at least two.

4196
02:22:16,020 --> 02:22:17,180
What is that?

4197
02:22:17,280 --> 02:22:18,320
Two ways!

4198
02:22:18,740 --> 02:22:19,800
Two ways!

4199
02:22:19,920 --> 02:22:20,420
Two!

4200
02:22:20,780 --> 02:22:22,080
Just two!

4201
02:22:25,660 --> 02:22:27,320
Don't worry, it's just...

4202
02:22:27,320 --> 02:22:29,720
The kids don't need sleep, they need food!

4203
02:22:30,940 --> 02:22:32,000
They don't need sleep!

4204
02:22:32,900 --> 02:22:34,220
We just need to feed!

4205
02:22:34,980 --> 02:22:35,740
Just feed.

4206
02:22:35,840 --> 02:22:37,140
Dirk Jr. Yes, yes, yes!

4207
02:22:37,200 --> 02:22:37,940
Eat, eat, eat!

4208
02:22:37,940 --> 02:22:38,300
Good job!

4209
02:22:38,620 --> 02:22:39,040
Yes!

4210
02:22:39,220 --> 02:22:42,940
It would be a shame, Dirk Jr. Wait, actually, no, not Dirk Jr. She's eating my mom!

4211
02:22:43,480 --> 02:22:44,160
I need a fine.

4212
02:22:44,300 --> 02:22:44,420
Good job!

4213
02:22:44,980 --> 02:22:46,120
Where's the better...

4214
02:22:47,780 --> 02:22:49,060
Where's the better dragoon?

4215
02:22:50,980 --> 02:22:54,080
It would be a shame if something happened to you.

4216
02:22:54,080 --> 02:22:56,240
It would be a shame if something happened to you.

4217
02:22:59,280 --> 02:23:02,160
It would be a shame if something happened to you.

4218
02:23:02,940 --> 02:23:05,700
It would be a shame if someone wouldn't find back home.

4219
02:23:08,120 --> 02:23:09,800
Dragoon, you're doing great!

4220
02:23:15,360 --> 02:23:18,080
Oh no, where did better dragoon go?

4221
02:23:18,160 --> 02:23:20,080
Where did better dragoon go?

4222
02:23:20,820 --> 02:23:24,060
It would be such a shame if something happened to you.

4223
02:23:24,080 --> 02:23:24,820
What should we do with that child?

4224
02:23:28,780 --> 02:23:30,800
Oh look at them Ypeeeing.

4225
02:23:30,820 --> 02:23:31,880
Are they so cute?

4226
02:23:32,000 --> 02:23:32,000
They are so cute!

4227
02:23:32,360 --> 02:23:33,160
Look at them!

4228
02:23:33,160 --> 02:23:34,380
They are Ypeeeing.

4229
02:23:34,380 --> 02:23:35,100
Look at them!

4230
02:23:35,260 --> 02:23:38,740
Okay, let's see.

4231
02:23:38,880 --> 02:23:40,020
How full are they?

4232
02:23:41,100 --> 02:23:42,200
Contipation is tired!

4233
02:23:42,480 --> 02:23:43,500
He is Ypeeeing.

4234
02:23:43,700 --> 02:23:44,660
Let him sleep!

4235
02:23:44,660 --> 02:23:45,060
He wants to Ypeee!

4236
02:23:45,500 --> 02:23:46,840
See, he is Ypeeing.

4237
02:23:47,380 --> 02:23:49,820
Go Ypeee!

4238
02:23:49,960 --> 02:23:50,380
Go Ypeee!

4239
02:23:50,800 --> 02:23:53,700
He has 8% sleep right now.

4240
02:23:53,860 --> 02:23:54,060
Go Ypeee!

4241
02:23:54,060 --> 02:23:54,060
Go Ypeee!

4242
02:23:54,840 --> 02:23:56,580
See, he's sleeping now.

4243
02:23:56,900 --> 02:23:58,360
Okay, let's see.

4244
02:23:58,700 --> 02:24:00,360
Oh my god, this is gonna take forever!

4245
02:24:00,720 --> 02:24:02,480
Why aren't you not adults yet?

4246
02:24:03,960 --> 02:24:04,900
What the heck?

4247
02:24:04,960 --> 02:24:07,380
Why aren't you adults within like 10 minutes?

4248
02:24:07,540 --> 02:24:07,840
What the fuck?

4249
02:24:07,960 --> 02:24:08,260
Grow!

4250
02:24:08,400 --> 02:24:09,080
Just grow!

4251
02:24:10,900 --> 02:24:12,340
Just grow, man.

4252
02:24:12,580 --> 02:24:12,940
Grow!

4253
02:24:14,180 --> 02:24:15,420
Oh, we gotta sleep too.

4254
02:24:15,480 --> 02:24:16,640
Guys, it's sleeping time.

4255
02:24:17,380 --> 02:24:18,120
Meep time!

4256
02:24:19,540 --> 02:24:20,860
Guys, other...

4257
02:24:20,860 --> 02:24:22,260
Oh, they're walking away.

4258
02:24:24,100 --> 02:24:27,520
Guys, if we all meep, they won't walk far.

4259
02:24:29,800 --> 02:24:31,380
What makes you say that?

4260
02:24:31,380 --> 02:24:33,400
If we meep and we wake up, they're just...

4261
02:24:33,400 --> 02:24:34,280
They're just gone.

4262
02:24:34,340 --> 02:24:35,240
...nowhere to be found.

4263
02:24:35,580 --> 02:24:36,100
Gone.

4264
02:24:36,800 --> 02:24:39,420
It's okay, less mouths to feed if you think about it.

4265
02:24:40,980 --> 02:24:43,600
It's called survival of the fittest, okay?

4266
02:24:44,260 --> 02:24:46,560
It's survival of the fittest for a reason, man.

4267
02:24:46,720 --> 02:24:47,240
Exactly.

4268
02:24:47,900 --> 02:24:49,340
Gets fucking eagled.

4269
02:24:49,560 --> 02:24:50,660
Who's not meeping?

4270
02:24:50,920 --> 02:24:52,760
The sky's not moving.

4271
02:24:52,820 --> 02:24:54,060
Who is not meeping right now?

4272
02:24:54,080 --> 02:24:55,500
The sky isn't moving.

4273
02:24:58,460 --> 02:24:59,940
Help, I need more sky.

4274
02:25:00,120 --> 02:25:00,600
We need...

4275
02:25:00,600 --> 02:25:01,720
The sky has to move.

4276
02:25:01,860 --> 02:25:02,760
Who is not eeping?

4277
02:25:02,840 --> 02:25:04,940
Who did not press Z and only pressed R?

4278
02:25:05,280 --> 02:25:06,200
Who is it?

4279
02:25:08,380 --> 02:25:08,860
Guys?

4280
02:25:09,360 --> 02:25:11,400
Guys, I'm gonna look at your eyes right now.

4281
02:25:12,980 --> 02:25:14,100
Oh my god!

4282
02:25:14,240 --> 02:25:14,440
Are your eyes closed?

4283
02:25:14,540 --> 02:25:16,340
That rabbit's so fucking fast.

4284
02:25:18,040 --> 02:25:18,520
Where...

4285
02:25:19,080 --> 02:25:19,620
Where's sky?

4286
02:25:20,420 --> 02:25:21,620
Why is it still nighttime?

4287
02:25:22,780 --> 02:25:23,560
Oh, there it is.

4288
02:25:23,560 --> 02:25:24,300
What the...

4289
02:25:24,300 --> 02:25:24,740
What the...

4290
02:25:24,740 --> 02:25:25,200
Wait, what?

4291
02:25:25,420 --> 02:25:25,980
What the fuck?

4292
02:25:26,000 --> 02:25:26,360
What is that?

4293
02:25:26,660 --> 02:25:27,780
What happened?

4294
02:25:28,760 --> 02:25:29,800
What happened?

4295
02:25:31,500 --> 02:25:32,360
What is...

4296
02:25:32,360 --> 02:25:33,580
What's going on?

4297
02:25:34,280 --> 02:25:34,900
Wait, wait...

4298
02:25:34,900 --> 02:25:35,120
Oh!

4299
02:25:35,800 --> 02:25:36,680
That eagle.

4300
02:25:36,880 --> 02:25:37,340
Stealing?

4301
02:25:37,520 --> 02:25:37,920
Eagle?

4302
02:25:38,480 --> 02:25:38,720
Caca!

4303
02:25:39,020 --> 02:25:39,420
Caca!

4304
02:25:40,520 --> 02:25:41,600
Did we have dreams?

4305
02:25:41,960 --> 02:25:42,920
Your pups are growing bigger!

4306
02:25:43,760 --> 02:25:44,460
Y'all!

4307
02:25:45,020 --> 02:25:46,000
More independent!

4308
02:25:46,500 --> 02:25:47,920
The center den while you are away.

4309
02:25:48,060 --> 02:25:50,260
As long as you pack affinities high.

4310
02:25:50,660 --> 02:25:51,580
Oh, fleas?

4311
02:25:51,580 --> 02:25:52,040
What is this?

4312
02:25:52,140 --> 02:25:52,300
What is this?

4313
02:25:52,300 --> 02:25:52,340
What is this?

4314
02:25:52,800 --> 02:25:52,880
What is this?

4315
02:25:52,880 --> 02:25:52,900
What is this?

4316
02:25:53,800 --> 02:25:54,660
Get out!

4317
02:25:54,660 --> 02:25:54,760
Get them away!

4318
02:25:55,260 --> 02:25:55,940
Get out!

4319
02:25:56,980 --> 02:25:58,040
Where's the flea control?

4320
02:25:59,800 --> 02:26:00,760
Flea control, hello!

4321
02:26:00,900 --> 02:26:02,200
Where's flea control?

4322
02:26:03,880 --> 02:26:05,300
How do we stop this?

4323
02:26:06,980 --> 02:26:07,640
It's okay.

4324
02:26:08,200 --> 02:26:10,000
How do we stop fleas?

4325
02:26:10,000 --> 02:26:10,560
Just like...

4326
02:26:10,560 --> 02:26:11,280
I don't know.

4327
02:26:11,580 --> 02:26:13,040
How do we stop fleas?

4328
02:26:13,720 --> 02:26:17,020
Can I just, like, roll around in the dirt and like, stop the fleas?

4329
02:26:17,220 --> 02:26:20,000
What's the collar's for if we can't stop the fleas?

4330
02:26:20,180 --> 02:26:20,740
Don't worry.

4331
02:26:20,780 --> 02:26:21,600
I got food for you guys.

4332
02:26:21,600 --> 02:26:22,480
Alright guys, breakfast time!

4333
02:26:24,180 --> 02:26:25,140
Breakfast time!

4334
02:26:26,520 --> 02:26:27,280
Here you go!

4335
02:26:27,380 --> 02:26:28,240
It's breaky time!

4336
02:26:28,480 --> 02:26:29,140
It's breaky time!

4337
02:26:31,200 --> 02:26:32,160
Alright Dragoon.

4338
02:26:33,420 --> 02:26:35,960
It's time to make sure you're socialized for the world.

4339
02:26:36,160 --> 02:26:38,740
I need you to be well adjusted wolves.

4340
02:26:41,580 --> 02:26:42,280
Nice, alright.

4341
02:26:42,540 --> 02:26:43,540
Look at us go.

4342
02:26:44,560 --> 02:26:46,240
I'm so proud of our babies.

4343
02:26:48,020 --> 02:26:49,880
I don't wanna take breaks from- What?

4344
02:26:52,580 --> 02:26:53,740
Pissed on the pup?

4345
02:26:55,980 --> 02:26:56,720
Nuh uh.

4346
02:26:56,880 --> 02:26:57,760
I don't think so.

4347
02:26:58,340 --> 02:27:00,700
Why are you not 15 pounds yet?

4348
02:27:00,800 --> 02:27:02,120
Stop pissing on the puppies!

4349
02:27:06,380 --> 02:27:06,940
Stop!

4350
02:27:12,460 --> 02:27:13,920
That's my puppy!

4351
02:27:14,860 --> 02:27:15,980
Who's constipation?

4352
02:27:16,160 --> 02:27:16,960
Where is he?

4353
02:27:17,980 --> 02:27:18,540
Okay, right.

4354
02:27:19,740 --> 02:27:21,880
I'll do it on your food too!

4355
02:27:22,460 --> 02:27:23,060
No!

4356
02:27:23,080 --> 02:27:23,860
The food!

4357
02:27:23,960 --> 02:27:24,540
That's right!

4358
02:27:25,080 --> 02:27:26,780
He's eating the food.

4359
02:27:27,500 --> 02:27:29,180
Eating the pee pee food.

4360
02:27:29,440 --> 02:27:29,900
That's right.

4361
02:27:29,960 --> 02:27:30,840
That's what you- No!

4362
02:27:32,340 --> 02:27:34,220
Why did you do it yourself?

4363
02:27:35,500 --> 02:27:36,100
Fuck!

4364
02:27:36,360 --> 02:27:37,460
That's on you!

4365
02:27:38,360 --> 02:27:39,780
That's on you!

4366
02:27:40,740 --> 02:27:42,000
Oh my god!

4367
02:27:42,320 --> 02:27:42,860
That's right.

4368
02:27:43,240 --> 02:27:46,140
You gotta be extra socialized.

4369
02:27:47,200 --> 02:27:47,340
I want accidents!

4370
02:27:47,340 --> 02:27:49,700
The constipation is past the limit.

4371
02:27:49,720 --> 02:27:50,160
Fuck out!

4372
02:27:51,500 --> 02:27:52,860
How does he not sleep?

4373
02:27:53,480 --> 02:27:54,340
Okay, let's see.

4374
02:27:54,480 --> 02:27:55,680
Oh they're 10 pounds now!

4375
02:27:56,680 --> 02:27:57,440
Oh my god!

4376
02:27:58,760 --> 02:27:59,720
They're 10 pounds!

4377
02:28:00,080 --> 02:28:01,420
We just need 5 more pounds!

4378
02:28:01,460 --> 02:28:02,000
We need to hunt!

4379
02:28:03,340 --> 02:28:04,080
They're so close!

4380
02:28:04,220 --> 02:28:06,140
Alright, we call this when they're 15 pounds.

4381
02:28:06,260 --> 02:28:07,240
And then we call it.

4382
02:28:07,800 --> 02:28:08,360
Yeah, yeah.

4383
02:28:08,420 --> 02:28:12,020
So they're more independent so we don't have to come back so they can fend for themselves.

4384
02:28:12,660 --> 02:28:13,560
So they can fuck off.

4385
02:28:14,120 --> 02:28:14,780
Yeah, yeah.

4386
02:28:14,880 --> 02:28:15,580
We kick them out.

4387
02:28:15,740 --> 02:28:21,560
You're like- You're 18 now so you can- You're 18 now so you can- Freeloaders?

4388
02:28:22,060 --> 02:28:23,440
There's a plane in the sky!

4389
02:28:23,980 --> 02:28:24,480
Oh my god!

4390
02:28:24,480 --> 02:28:25,580
There's a flying thing!

4391
02:28:27,140 --> 02:28:28,560
It's yellow like you!

4392
02:28:29,240 --> 02:28:29,700
It's yellow like you!

4393
02:28:29,700 --> 02:28:29,940
Like me!

4394
02:28:30,900 --> 02:28:33,180
Take it down, so we can take it down.

4395
02:28:33,340 --> 02:28:34,580
There can only be one!

4396
02:28:34,780 --> 02:28:36,680
There can only be one yellow.

4397
02:28:39,800 --> 02:28:40,820
What the heck?

4398
02:28:40,840 --> 02:28:42,200
Who allowed them to be yellow?

4399
02:28:42,480 --> 02:28:45,320
We gotta make sure they're 15 pounds or they'll have to pay rent.

4400
02:28:45,600 --> 02:28:45,660
We gotta make sure they're 15 pounds or they'll have to pay rent.

4401
02:28:46,340 --> 02:28:47,020
Oh my god!

4402
02:28:47,140 --> 02:28:47,420
I got bison!

4403
02:28:47,680 --> 02:28:48,540
Yeah, you're still living at home.

4404
02:28:48,680 --> 02:28:49,160
Bison!

4405
02:28:49,380 --> 02:28:50,700
Yeah, there's bison near me!

4406
02:28:51,660 --> 02:28:53,020
Oh my god!

4407
02:28:53,140 --> 02:28:54,500
Oh my god!

4408
02:28:54,700 --> 02:28:55,460
Oh, I'm so far away.

4409
02:28:55,840 --> 02:28:57,340
Oh, I'm- Oh, okay.

4410
02:28:57,580 --> 02:28:58,640
Bison too scary.

4411
02:28:58,820 --> 02:28:59,420
I can't.

4412
02:28:59,420 --> 02:28:59,820
I can't.

4413
02:29:00,840 --> 02:29:01,960
Bison's too strong.

4414
02:29:02,400 --> 02:29:03,900
We will get the bison.

4415
02:29:04,060 --> 02:29:04,880
We're getting invaded!

4416
02:29:05,380 --> 02:29:05,740
We are?

4417
02:29:06,140 --> 02:29:06,620
Cougars!

4418
02:29:06,700 --> 02:29:07,260
Oh, cougars!

4419
02:29:07,340 --> 02:29:08,120
Oh, I'm limping!

4420
02:29:08,660 --> 02:29:12,340
Okay, bison is- I have a fractured leg right now, so...

4421
02:29:13,880 --> 02:29:14,360
Unlucky.

4422
02:29:15,060 --> 02:29:15,540
Unlucky.

4423
02:29:16,340 --> 02:29:17,880
I think I'm gonna be reduced to child care.

4424
02:29:18,040 --> 02:29:19,500
I can't hunt anymore.

4425
02:29:20,960 --> 02:29:22,240
Stay at home, father.

4426
02:29:22,480 --> 02:29:24,220
I'm gonna be a stay at home father.

4427
02:29:24,260 --> 02:29:27,980
I realize hunting- I- Just hunting wasn't for me.

4428
02:29:28,880 --> 02:29:30,280
Oh my god, where's the cougars?

4429
02:29:30,780 --> 02:29:31,980
No, they're in the den!

4430
02:29:32,080 --> 02:29:34,080
Okay, we have to find a new house for them too.

4431
02:29:35,460 --> 02:29:38,780
Because like, they're now- They're just gonna be filled with fleas now.

4432
02:29:39,600 --> 02:29:40,040
Oh!

4433
02:29:40,320 --> 02:29:40,760
No!

4434
02:29:40,840 --> 02:29:43,580
We have a couple- We have other dens though, right?

4435
02:29:43,700 --> 02:29:44,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4436
02:29:44,520 --> 02:29:45,780
We have to move to a new den.

4437
02:29:46,700 --> 02:29:47,500
Go places.

4438
02:29:47,740 --> 02:29:49,200
Okay, after we kill this cougar.

4439
02:29:49,260 --> 02:29:50,360
Where the fuck is the cougar?

4440
02:29:50,400 --> 02:29:51,080
Where is the cougar?

4441
02:29:51,220 --> 02:29:51,900
Where is it?

4442
02:29:52,020 --> 02:29:52,820
Oh, he's right here!

4443
02:29:53,360 --> 02:29:54,140
Oh, he's right here!

4444
02:29:54,340 --> 02:29:58,000
He's right here!

4445
02:29:58,240 --> 02:29:58,820
I'm helping!

4446
02:29:59,760 --> 02:30:00,560
I'm supervising!

4447
02:30:00,640 --> 02:30:01,800
I have a broken leg!

4448
02:30:01,860 --> 02:30:02,460
I'm supervising!

4449
02:30:04,000 --> 02:30:04,800
I'm supervising!

4450
02:30:05,020 --> 02:30:05,920
I'm supervising!

4451
02:30:06,240 --> 02:30:08,480
Yeah, yeah, doing- Yeah, you guys are doing great!

4452
02:30:08,560 --> 02:30:09,220
Good job!

4453
02:30:09,420 --> 02:30:10,220
Good job, guys!

4454
02:30:10,440 --> 02:30:10,860
Okay, okay.

4455
02:30:11,180 --> 02:30:13,980
Make sure to grab the neck, you know?

4456
02:30:14,600 --> 02:30:15,840
Grab the neck and tie it.

4457
02:30:16,020 --> 02:30:16,220
Yeah, yeah.

4458
02:30:16,340 --> 02:30:17,180
It's all in the neck.

4459
02:30:17,280 --> 02:30:17,820
It's all in the neck.

4460
02:30:18,820 --> 02:30:19,460
There we go.

4461
02:30:19,580 --> 02:30:20,220
Neck tie him.

4462
02:30:20,340 --> 02:30:20,800
Yeah, yeah.

4463
02:30:20,800 --> 02:30:21,360
Nice, nice, nice.

4464
02:30:21,500 --> 02:30:22,360
Now bring him down.

4465
02:30:22,460 --> 02:30:24,740
Now if you do a flip, you're gonna flip him to the back.

4466
02:30:24,800 --> 02:30:25,340
Okay, guys?

4467
02:30:26,920 --> 02:30:27,860
Flip it on his back.

4468
02:30:28,320 --> 02:30:29,120
Do it, do it.

4469
02:30:31,400 --> 02:30:32,600
Dude, he's tanky!

4470
02:30:32,600 --> 02:30:33,220
What the heck?

4471
02:30:33,360 --> 02:30:34,340
Bro, he's so tanky!

4472
02:30:35,480 --> 02:30:36,240
It's a cat!

4473
02:30:36,880 --> 02:30:38,860
That's- Menci, what are you doing?

4474
02:30:39,000 --> 02:30:39,660
You're not supervisor!

4475
02:30:42,300 --> 02:30:43,200
You're not supervising.

4476
02:30:43,200 --> 02:30:43,920
What the heck?

4477
02:30:43,920 --> 02:30:45,060
Yeah, what are you doing?

4478
02:30:45,300 --> 02:30:45,860
That's right.

4479
02:30:46,220 --> 02:30:49,780
Now go- Now bite the leg here, on the- the hind leg.

4480
02:30:49,980 --> 02:30:50,780
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4481
02:30:50,880 --> 02:30:52,280
One hind leg, one neck.

4482
02:30:52,380 --> 02:30:53,640
Oh, oh, there you go!

4483
02:30:53,740 --> 02:30:54,400
Good job, guys.

4484
02:30:54,780 --> 02:30:54,940
Boom!

4485
02:30:55,160 --> 02:30:56,080
Good job.

4486
02:30:56,740 --> 02:30:58,160
That's what I call a team.

4487
02:30:59,100 --> 02:31:00,800
Kingy peed on the cougar.

4488
02:31:02,020 --> 02:31:03,080
Kingy peed on the cougar.

4489
02:31:03,080 --> 02:31:03,640
Real quick.

4490
02:31:04,420 --> 02:31:05,940
Just mark our territory.

4491
02:31:07,380 --> 02:31:08,080
I know.

4492
02:31:08,320 --> 02:31:09,200
I have to know.

4493
02:31:09,500 --> 02:31:11,660
I'm gonna move the pups to a new den.

4494
02:31:11,660 --> 02:31:14,060
Cause there's too many fleas.

4495
02:31:14,080 --> 02:31:14,180
Let's go.

4496
02:31:15,000 --> 02:31:16,560
Too many fleas.

4497
02:31:16,560 --> 02:31:17,200
Okay, puppies.

4498
02:31:17,820 --> 02:31:19,440
41% fleas!

4499
02:31:19,440 --> 02:31:20,000
What the heck?

4500
02:31:20,000 --> 02:31:22,000
Okay, yeah, we're moving these puppies.

4501
02:31:22,080 --> 02:31:23,620
We are moving these puppies.

4502
02:31:23,940 --> 02:31:26,020
Yeah, these puppies need to get out.

4503
02:31:26,380 --> 02:31:27,680
Wait, where is my house?

4504
02:31:27,840 --> 02:31:28,820
Okay, where do we move?

4505
02:31:29,200 --> 02:31:30,820
To the middle, I guess.

4506
02:31:31,140 --> 02:31:33,000
The center of our territory.

4507
02:31:33,580 --> 02:31:35,360
Alright, uh, let's see.

4508
02:31:35,660 --> 02:31:36,420
Pack info.

4509
02:31:36,640 --> 02:31:37,980
Move to a- Do you want to move?

4510
02:31:38,060 --> 02:31:38,320
Yes.

4511
02:31:39,160 --> 02:31:40,860
Okay, you're off to a new den.

4512
02:31:41,780 --> 02:31:42,220
Continue.

4513
02:31:42,800 --> 02:31:44,400
Go hunting between...

4514
02:31:44,400 --> 02:31:46,360
Find a patch of tall grass.

4515
02:31:46,440 --> 02:31:47,740
Okay, we each pick up our child.

4516
02:31:48,220 --> 02:31:49,080
Pick up our child.

4517
02:31:49,640 --> 02:31:50,840
I've got my child.

4518
02:31:51,060 --> 02:31:51,800
Don't pee on my child!

4519
02:31:54,360 --> 02:31:54,800
Alright.

4520
02:31:55,940 --> 02:31:58,800
Okay, we're gonna go downwards, guys.

4521
02:31:59,140 --> 02:31:59,840
Actually, no, up.

4522
02:31:59,840 --> 02:32:00,580
Up is faster.

4523
02:32:01,000 --> 02:32:02,240
We're gonna go up here.

4524
02:32:02,340 --> 02:32:02,940
Follow me.

4525
02:32:02,980 --> 02:32:03,840
Follow your alpha.

4526
02:32:04,740 --> 02:32:05,540
Following the leader?

4527
02:32:06,020 --> 02:32:06,860
Where am I?

4528
02:32:06,980 --> 02:32:07,600
Give me a sec.

4529
02:32:07,660 --> 02:32:08,580
I need to figure out where I am first.

4530
02:32:10,580 --> 02:32:11,720
So this is west?

4531
02:32:14,820 --> 02:32:15,820
Which one's me?

4532
02:32:15,980 --> 02:32:16,460
Is this me?

4533
02:32:16,560 --> 02:32:16,960
Am I the red?

4534
02:32:17,100 --> 02:32:17,280
Yeah.

4535
02:32:21,580 --> 02:32:22,540
Don't worry, guys.

4536
02:32:22,680 --> 02:32:23,860
Follow the alpha.

4537
02:32:23,880 --> 02:32:24,820
I just got this!

4538
02:32:24,880 --> 02:32:25,480
I got this!

4539
02:32:26,200 --> 02:32:27,440
Yes, okay, we go straight.

4540
02:32:27,640 --> 02:32:28,380
We go straight.

4541
02:32:28,720 --> 02:32:29,320
She got a plan!

4542
02:32:29,800 --> 02:32:31,100
We go straight.

4543
02:32:31,340 --> 02:32:32,940
Pick up your child and go straight.

4544
02:32:33,420 --> 02:32:35,440
I hope we're not missing a child.

4545
02:32:35,800 --> 02:32:37,120
That's all I hope for.

4546
02:32:37,280 --> 02:32:38,260
Can you imagine?

4547
02:32:38,580 --> 02:32:39,960
We like forgot one.

4548
02:32:40,260 --> 02:32:43,820
All these bear attacks, cougar raids, and we just forget it at the mall.

4549
02:32:43,980 --> 02:32:46,240
Yeah, we forgot one kid at the mall.

4550
02:32:46,460 --> 02:32:48,160
We got everybody, right?

4551
02:32:49,700 --> 02:32:51,320
Is everybody here?

4552
02:32:51,700 --> 02:32:51,800
Is everybody here?

4553
02:32:52,240 --> 02:32:56,240
If the yellow wolf could pick up that child, Dragoon, yes.

4554
02:32:58,300 --> 02:32:59,080
Dragoon at reception.

4555
02:32:59,080 --> 02:32:59,320
Guys, I'm limping.

4556
02:32:59,400 --> 02:33:00,040
Give me a sec.

4557
02:33:00,120 --> 02:33:01,260
I can't run anymore.

4558
02:33:02,020 --> 02:33:03,460
I have to walk now.

4559
02:33:03,800 --> 02:33:05,280
Just walk for half.

4560
02:33:05,320 --> 02:33:05,780
Give me a sec.

4561
02:33:05,860 --> 02:33:08,200
Let me put down... Wait, where did my child go?

4562
02:33:08,580 --> 02:33:09,340
Oh my god.

4563
02:33:09,600 --> 02:33:10,400
He's digging!

4564
02:33:10,560 --> 02:33:11,400
Why are you digging?

4565
02:33:13,760 --> 02:33:14,760
Digging for treasure.

4566
02:33:16,940 --> 02:33:18,820
Dragoon, it's not time for fun right now.

4567
02:33:18,860 --> 02:33:19,740
You're filled with fleas.

4568
02:33:20,380 --> 02:33:21,440
You're filled with fleas.

4569
02:33:21,440 --> 02:33:22,360
You can't go to school.

4570
02:33:22,540 --> 02:33:23,060
You're nasty.

4571
02:33:23,220 --> 02:33:23,840
You got fleas.

4572
02:33:25,600 --> 02:33:26,760
Oh my god, we're almost there.

4573
02:33:27,200 --> 02:33:28,120
We're almost there.

4574
02:33:28,540 --> 02:33:29,420
Follow the alpha.

4575
02:33:29,920 --> 02:33:30,700
So close.

4576
02:33:31,460 --> 02:33:32,660
It's up close.

4577
02:33:33,820 --> 02:33:34,900
It's like, Jason!

4578
02:33:34,900 --> 02:33:35,320
Jason!

4579
02:33:35,740 --> 02:33:36,340
Jason!

4580
02:33:36,780 --> 02:33:37,380
Jason!

4581
02:33:40,000 --> 02:33:42,140
Oh my god, I don't have more stamina.

4582
02:33:42,500 --> 02:33:44,240
Oh my god, you have to drop your child.

4583
02:33:44,500 --> 02:33:45,520
Drop the baby.

4584
02:33:45,920 --> 02:33:47,480
No, concentration!

4585
02:33:47,860 --> 02:33:48,360
Stop!

4586
02:33:48,640 --> 02:33:49,340
Come here!

4587
02:33:49,500 --> 02:33:50,820
Drop the baby!

4588
02:33:51,680 --> 02:33:52,740
No, concentration!

4589
02:33:53,080 --> 02:33:53,540
Stop it!

4590
02:33:55,240 --> 02:33:56,440
Oh, damn.

4591
02:33:56,520 --> 02:33:57,840
Where's the Turner?

4592
02:33:58,420 --> 02:34:00,040
He's a fleeting one.

4593
02:34:00,560 --> 02:34:01,460
Is this the Turner?

4594
02:34:01,740 --> 02:34:02,500
Oh, there it is.

4595
02:34:02,680 --> 02:34:03,840
This is... okay.

4596
02:34:04,900 --> 02:34:07,300
This is a pretty shitty den, but...

4597
02:34:08,600 --> 02:34:09,380
It's fine.

4598
02:34:09,960 --> 02:34:11,480
Oh, we got food right here!

4599
02:34:11,640 --> 02:34:13,260
We can just put them here.

4600
02:34:13,380 --> 02:34:14,060
And we can hunt.

4601
02:34:15,640 --> 02:34:16,700
Alright, here we go.

4602
02:34:17,000 --> 02:34:18,260
Welcome, my new...

4603
02:34:18,900 --> 02:34:20,880
Alright, what do we call this house?

4604
02:34:21,740 --> 02:34:23,520
I'll take 50% of your name.

4605
02:34:23,840 --> 02:34:25,100
50%?

4606
02:34:28,220 --> 02:34:31,880
I'm starting to believe you just don't appreciate my naming capabilities.

4607
02:34:32,160 --> 02:34:32,660
I gave you 50%!

4608
02:34:33,300 --> 02:34:34,120
I gave you 50%!

4609
02:34:34,120 --> 02:34:34,880
I gave you 50%!

4610
02:34:34,900 --> 02:34:35,380
50%?

4611
02:34:35,380 --> 02:34:36,200
You take 50%?

4612
02:34:36,260 --> 02:34:37,180
It's just fair!

4613
02:34:38,700 --> 02:34:39,460
Okay, okay.

4614
02:34:39,820 --> 02:34:40,340
Moist.

4615
02:34:42,180 --> 02:34:44,380
Okay, 50% of that is...

4616
02:34:44,980 --> 02:34:45,880
No, no, no!

4617
02:34:48,410 --> 02:34:49,390
No, no, no!

4618
02:34:49,770 --> 02:34:50,670
Is that how it works?

4619
02:34:51,970 --> 02:34:55,370
You give me a name and I take 50% of it!

4620
02:34:55,430 --> 02:34:56,790
That's exactly how it works!

4621
02:34:58,530 --> 02:35:00,250
Moist, moist cabbage den.

4622
02:35:00,470 --> 02:35:01,590
Okay, cabbage...

4623
02:35:02,290 --> 02:35:02,810
No!

4624
02:35:03,590 --> 02:35:04,110
No!

4625
02:35:05,050 --> 02:35:05,570
No!

4626
02:35:05,570 --> 02:35:05,810
No!

4627
02:35:09,510 --> 02:35:10,710
Moldy foot fungus!

4628
02:35:11,590 --> 02:35:12,690
It's too late!

4629
02:35:13,730 --> 02:35:14,330
Dammit!

4630
02:35:14,590 --> 02:35:17,190
I already need your new home, guys.

4631
02:35:19,550 --> 02:35:20,150
Yippee!

4632
02:35:20,590 --> 02:35:22,250
What's our new home called?

4633
02:35:22,750 --> 02:35:22,770
Yay!

4634
02:35:24,750 --> 02:35:26,330
Alright, I'm gonna go find food.

4635
02:35:26,330 --> 02:35:27,290
Cabbage goon!

4636
02:35:29,270 --> 02:35:31,630
I'm gonna grab us some food.

4637
02:35:32,030 --> 02:35:32,630
Alright.

4638
02:35:32,690 --> 02:35:34,330
I just hunted something down.

4639
02:35:34,510 --> 02:35:35,790
Alright, I'm gonna eat this real quick.

4640
02:35:35,810 --> 02:35:36,150
It's so fast.

4641
02:35:36,190 --> 02:35:37,990
It's a small little antelope.

4642
02:35:38,130 --> 02:35:38,930
Hey, hey, hey.

4643
02:35:39,230 --> 02:35:39,630
Nice.

4644
02:35:39,930 --> 02:35:41,730
Holy shit, this guy is zooming!

4645
02:35:43,270 --> 02:35:44,670
Okay, I'm gonna eat this rabbit.

4646
02:35:45,870 --> 02:35:46,270
Nice.

4647
02:35:46,690 --> 02:35:47,870
Nom, nom, nom, nom.

4648
02:35:48,030 --> 02:35:48,610
Yum, yum, yum, yum.

4649
02:35:49,450 --> 02:35:50,630
Vom, vom, vom, vom.

4650
02:35:50,910 --> 02:35:52,730
Alright, how much do they weigh now?

4651
02:35:53,130 --> 02:35:55,130
They are 10.5.

4652
02:35:55,410 --> 02:35:55,990
Okay, 11.

4653
02:35:56,090 --> 02:35:57,590
Someone wanted us at 11 pounds right now.

4654
02:35:57,730 --> 02:35:58,870
One is malnourished.

4655
02:35:58,930 --> 02:36:00,570
Who the fuck is not taking care of their children?

4656
02:36:01,170 --> 02:36:01,870
Who is it?

4657
02:36:02,010 --> 02:36:02,230
Why?

4658
02:36:02,530 --> 02:36:04,530
Who the heck is malnourished?

4659
02:36:04,990 --> 02:36:05,390
Dizzy!

4660
02:36:05,810 --> 02:36:07,070
Your child is malnourished!

4661
02:36:07,150 --> 02:36:08,210
Feed your child!

4662
02:36:09,370 --> 02:36:09,930
Feed!

4663
02:36:10,930 --> 02:36:11,490
Feed!

4664
02:36:11,490 --> 02:36:12,370
Feed the baby!

4665
02:36:12,750 --> 02:36:13,970
Feed the baby!

4666
02:36:15,430 --> 02:36:16,910
I can't believe it.

4667
02:36:16,950 --> 02:36:18,910
Don't make us call Wolf Support on you.

4668
02:36:19,070 --> 02:36:20,330
I'm coming to Vom!

4669
02:36:21,750 --> 02:36:24,390
I'm trying to find more food for us.

4670
02:36:28,270 --> 02:36:29,290
I'm looking...

4671
02:36:29,290 --> 02:36:31,210
Holy shit, it's so hard to find food.

4672
02:36:33,450 --> 02:36:34,690
Camp, who chose this?

4673
02:36:34,790 --> 02:36:35,670
Who chose this?

4674
02:36:35,810 --> 02:36:37,050
There's no food around us.

4675
02:36:37,210 --> 02:36:38,170
Yeah, what the heck?

4676
02:36:38,990 --> 02:36:40,430
Dizzy, was it you?

4677
02:36:40,690 --> 02:36:41,490
I bet it was Dizzy.

4678
02:36:42,110 --> 02:36:44,050
Dizzy, why did you choose this place?

4679
02:36:44,130 --> 02:36:45,270
There's barely any food anywhere.

4680
02:36:45,630 --> 02:36:45,650
Tada!

4681
02:36:47,010 --> 02:36:48,150
Here's some food.

4682
02:36:48,490 --> 02:36:49,730
I got some hair.

4683
02:36:49,870 --> 02:36:53,990
And then we can Vom.

4684
02:36:57,290 --> 02:37:00,650
So hunting with bruised jaw and a broken leg.

4685
02:37:00,790 --> 02:37:01,710
Look, look.

4686
02:37:01,770 --> 02:37:02,410
This is...

4687
02:37:02,410 --> 02:37:04,130
Parenthood is hard.

4688
02:37:06,630 --> 02:37:07,570
It's difficult.

4689
02:37:08,130 --> 02:37:08,830
It's difficult.

4690
02:37:08,990 --> 02:37:12,390
You think you can hunt an elk on your own?

4691
02:37:12,730 --> 02:37:13,910
That's fucking right.

4692
02:37:14,290 --> 02:37:14,790
Ow!

4693
02:37:20,130 --> 02:37:23,350
No constipation!

4694
02:37:23,490 --> 02:37:24,310
Stop sleeping!

4695
02:37:24,750 --> 02:37:25,230
You have to eat.

4696
02:37:25,270 --> 02:37:26,250
He's hungry!

4697
02:37:26,690 --> 02:37:27,510
I mean, he's sleepy.

4698
02:37:27,570 --> 02:37:30,610
Look at his... He has 7% sleep!

4699
02:37:30,710 --> 02:37:31,390
What do you mean?

4700
02:37:32,310 --> 02:37:34,210
Why is he never sleeping?

4701
02:37:34,210 --> 02:37:37,330
What do you mean he's actually sleepy?

4702
02:37:37,830 --> 02:37:37,970
What do you mean he's actually sleepy?

4703
02:37:37,970 --> 02:37:39,930
What do you mean don't fucking sleep?

4704
02:37:40,130 --> 02:37:40,930
You're fucking...

4705
02:37:40,930 --> 02:37:44,330
Your fucking child is actually sleep deprived.

4706
02:37:45,750 --> 02:37:47,790
Why is he always sleepy?

4707
02:37:48,130 --> 02:37:49,590
He's playing too much video games.

4708
02:37:50,450 --> 02:37:51,850
I can't believe it.

4709
02:37:51,950 --> 02:37:52,710
I told you!

4710
02:37:52,870 --> 02:37:55,710
I told you making him play video games is a bad idea!

4711
02:37:56,170 --> 02:37:56,370
I told you!

4712
02:37:56,370 --> 02:37:56,370
I told you making him play video games is a bad idea!

4713
02:37:56,430 --> 02:37:58,750
But someone has to farm gold!

4714
02:38:01,330 --> 02:38:03,990
But someone has to farm gold!

4715
02:38:03,990 --> 02:38:05,610
If they can't be gold farmers...

4716
02:38:05,610 --> 02:38:08,270
And do your in-game chores...

4717
02:38:08,270 --> 02:38:09,370
Oh my god!

4718
02:38:09,410 --> 02:38:10,470
There's so many wolves on me!

4719
02:38:10,850 --> 02:38:12,490
Oh my god!

4720
02:38:13,210 --> 02:38:13,850
Guys!

4721
02:38:13,930 --> 02:38:14,270
She's dead.

4722
02:38:14,430 --> 02:38:15,210
I'm fucking...

4723
02:38:15,210 --> 02:38:16,250
I'm dead!

4724
02:38:16,730 --> 02:38:17,290
I'm dead!

4725
02:38:18,710 --> 02:38:20,210
Someone help me!

4726
02:38:20,910 --> 02:38:22,390
I got ambushed!

4727
02:38:22,390 --> 02:38:22,970
Wait, how far?

4728
02:38:23,270 --> 02:38:25,650
I got ambushed!

4729
02:38:25,650 --> 02:38:26,370
Oh my god!

4730
02:38:27,010 --> 02:38:28,390
Oh my god!

4731
02:38:30,490 --> 02:38:31,770
Holy shit!

4732
02:38:31,950 --> 02:38:32,850
What the heck?

4733
02:38:34,050 --> 02:38:35,830
Someone help me!

4734
02:38:36,210 --> 02:38:36,850
Ow!

4735
02:38:36,850 --> 02:38:36,890
Ow!

4736
02:38:37,290 --> 02:38:37,830
Ow!

4737
02:38:38,230 --> 02:38:38,870
Ow!

4738
02:38:39,050 --> 02:38:39,250
Ow!

4739
02:38:39,790 --> 02:38:40,790
Leave me alone!

4740
02:38:40,950 --> 02:38:41,190
Ow!

4741
02:38:41,450 --> 02:38:41,890
Ow!

4742
02:38:42,030 --> 02:38:43,050
I got jumped!

4743
02:38:43,230 --> 02:38:44,970
I got jumped!

4744
02:38:47,150 --> 02:38:48,270
I'm so dead!

4745
02:38:48,350 --> 02:38:48,930
What the heck?

4746
02:38:51,150 --> 02:38:52,630
I got jumped!

4747
02:38:53,710 --> 02:38:54,350
No!

4748
02:38:54,890 --> 02:38:55,450
No!

4749
02:38:55,490 --> 02:38:56,830
Take a distractor!

4750
02:38:57,710 --> 02:38:58,230
Distract him!

4751
02:38:58,250 --> 02:38:58,710
I'm gonna live!

4752
02:38:58,970 --> 02:38:59,470
No!

4753
02:39:01,750 --> 02:39:03,090
Please stop me!

4754
02:39:04,930 --> 02:39:05,650
That's okay!

4755
02:39:06,030 --> 02:39:07,090
I'm running away!

4756
02:39:08,030 --> 02:39:08,690
It's okay!

4757
02:39:08,730 --> 02:39:09,430
I'm running away!

4758
02:39:11,850 --> 02:39:12,970
I'm dead again!

4759
02:39:13,790 --> 02:39:14,270
No!

4760
02:39:14,970 --> 02:39:15,450
No!

4761
02:39:16,750 --> 02:39:17,650
I'm so dead!

4762
02:39:17,730 --> 02:39:18,250
I'm so dead!

4763
02:39:18,410 --> 02:39:19,650
There's too many of them!

4764
02:39:20,530 --> 02:39:21,470
There's too many!

4765
02:39:21,510 --> 02:39:21,930
Help!

4766
02:39:25,610 --> 02:39:26,090
No!

4767
02:39:26,290 --> 02:39:26,590
I got distracted!

4768
02:39:26,590 --> 02:39:27,030
Distract him!

4769
02:39:27,190 --> 02:39:27,570
Leave me alone!

4770
02:39:29,670 --> 02:39:30,330
Oh god!

4771
02:39:30,790 --> 02:39:31,890
I got jumped!

4772
02:39:31,890 --> 02:39:34,130
I went to the wrong part of town!

4773
02:39:34,330 --> 02:39:34,830
Leave me alone!

4774
02:39:35,430 --> 02:39:36,490
Holy shit!

4775
02:39:37,090 --> 02:39:37,770
I'm running!

4776
02:39:38,790 --> 02:39:39,950
Oh my god!

4777
02:39:40,190 --> 02:39:43,310
I went... I accidentally invaded somebody else's territory!

4778
02:39:43,510 --> 02:39:44,570
I learned my lesson!

4779
02:39:44,670 --> 02:39:45,150
I'm sorry!

4780
02:39:45,490 --> 02:39:46,330
I learned my lesson!

4781
02:39:46,930 --> 02:39:48,370
I learned my lesson!

4782
02:39:48,370 --> 02:39:49,150
Holy shit!

4783
02:39:49,550 --> 02:39:50,450
Oh my god!

4784
02:39:50,490 --> 02:39:52,230
I'm so fucked up right now!

4785
02:39:52,710 --> 02:39:54,450
Dude, I'm almost dead!

4786
02:39:55,610 --> 02:39:56,630
Oh shit!

4787
02:39:56,630 --> 02:39:56,850
Oh fuck!

4788
02:39:57,570 --> 02:39:58,850
My leg!

4789
02:39:59,170 --> 02:40:00,130
Where's my...

4790
02:40:00,130 --> 02:40:01,430
Where's the children?

4791
02:40:02,250 --> 02:40:03,170
I need to sleep!

4792
02:40:03,790 --> 02:40:04,910
I need... I'm EP!

4793
02:40:05,410 --> 02:40:06,470
I need an EP!

4794
02:40:07,430 --> 02:40:08,590
I need an EP!

4795
02:40:08,890 --> 02:40:09,670
EP time!

4796
02:40:10,730 --> 02:40:11,570
Goodnight everybody!

4797
02:40:13,330 --> 02:40:14,510
Wait, but the children!

4798
02:40:14,810 --> 02:40:15,650
Are they inside?

4799
02:40:15,970 --> 02:40:16,950
Oh okay, they're all inside.

4800
02:40:17,170 --> 02:40:19,050
Me me me me me me me me!

4801
02:40:21,990 --> 02:40:23,510
Me me me me me me me me!

4802
02:40:23,510 --> 02:40:26,630
Me me me me me me me me!

4803
02:40:28,550 --> 02:40:31,290
You're telling me to lose Blubber to run faster?

4804
02:40:31,330 --> 02:40:31,570
No!

4805
02:40:31,690 --> 02:40:33,110
The Blubber is what saved me!

4806
02:40:33,690 --> 02:40:35,330
I had cushioning!

4807
02:40:35,330 --> 02:40:36,810
The extra armor fat!

4808
02:40:37,330 --> 02:40:37,790
Yeah!

4809
02:40:38,290 --> 02:40:40,070
Me me me me me me me me me me!

4810
02:40:40,630 --> 02:40:42,670
Why is there fire in the forest?

4811
02:40:42,730 --> 02:40:43,210
What the heck?

4812
02:40:43,290 --> 02:40:44,890
Guys, don't go to the purple area!

4813
02:40:45,550 --> 02:40:46,590
It's dangerous!

4814
02:40:47,270 --> 02:40:48,930
Do not the purple!

4815
02:40:49,170 --> 02:40:50,110
The purple area!

4816
02:40:51,250 --> 02:40:52,710
Never go to purple!

4817
02:40:55,170 --> 02:40:57,170
Alright, how much do they weigh now?

4818
02:40:58,470 --> 02:41:00,210
12.3 Oh there's 13!

4819
02:41:00,310 --> 02:41:01,070
We need 2 more pounds!

4820
02:41:01,910 --> 02:41:02,470
Guys!

4821
02:41:02,990 --> 02:41:03,550
Easy!

4822
02:41:03,890 --> 02:41:06,730
I killed something!

4823
02:41:07,010 --> 02:41:08,690
Oh, it's spoiled probably.

4824
02:41:09,830 --> 02:41:11,450
I'm gonna go hunt again.

4825
02:41:12,570 --> 02:41:13,410
Hunting die!

4826
02:41:13,470 --> 02:41:14,610
It's time to hunt.

4827
02:41:14,850 --> 02:41:16,290
I need to make sure I don't go to purple.

4828
02:41:16,630 --> 02:41:17,630
But my leg is broken!

4829
02:41:17,930 --> 02:41:19,210
I don't think I can hunt anything.

4830
02:41:20,550 --> 02:41:23,330
Look, I hunted with a broken jaw!

4831
02:41:23,770 --> 02:41:24,890
If I can...

4832
02:41:25,850 --> 02:41:28,750
If I can do it, so can you!

4833
02:41:28,790 --> 02:41:29,090
Yeah!

4834
02:41:29,850 --> 02:41:31,790
Don't be a fucking coward!

4835
02:41:32,090 --> 02:41:33,170
Don't be a baby!

4836
02:41:34,550 --> 02:41:36,550
Don't be a baby, baby!

4837
02:41:37,730 --> 02:41:39,710
Our children need food!

4838
02:41:39,910 --> 02:41:42,730
You want them to starve after everything we've been through?

4839
02:41:43,210 --> 02:41:43,950
I would never.

4840
02:41:43,950 --> 02:41:44,130
I would never.

4841
02:41:45,030 --> 02:41:45,370
What?

4842
02:41:46,850 --> 02:41:50,030
Oh, I can kill like baby deer!

4843
02:41:50,430 --> 02:41:50,650
Oh!

4844
02:41:52,270 --> 02:41:53,690
Oh, killing babies!

4845
02:41:54,310 --> 02:41:54,990
Yeah!

4846
02:41:55,330 --> 02:41:59,070
Look, it's all about killing the babies so that our babies can survive.

4847
02:41:59,070 --> 02:41:59,650
I found one!

4848
02:42:00,650 --> 02:42:01,170
Okay.

4849
02:42:03,630 --> 02:42:04,990
The rabbit is fast.

4850
02:42:05,970 --> 02:42:06,490
Nice.

4851
02:42:06,950 --> 02:42:08,550
I'm still like so hungry.

4852
02:42:09,710 --> 02:42:10,930
That's right, that's right.

4853
02:42:11,130 --> 02:42:12,410
Oh, oh that is fun!

4854
02:42:12,490 --> 02:42:13,290
It's just a baby!

4855
02:42:13,490 --> 02:42:14,250
That is so fun!

4856
02:42:14,350 --> 02:42:14,550
Nice!

4857
02:42:14,770 --> 02:42:15,430
That's what we like!

4858
02:42:15,650 --> 02:42:15,930
I got this!

4859
02:42:18,510 --> 02:42:19,910
You got this!

4860
02:42:20,290 --> 02:42:22,330
I believe in you!

4861
02:42:22,710 --> 02:42:23,110
Okay.

4862
02:42:23,430 --> 02:42:25,830
That is a elk.

4863
02:42:27,210 --> 02:42:27,730
Woo!

4864
02:42:29,070 --> 02:42:29,210
Okay.

4865
02:42:29,770 --> 02:42:32,410
Don't worry, I might bruise my mouth again.

4866
02:42:32,610 --> 02:42:33,290
Oh, fuck!

4867
02:42:33,510 --> 02:42:34,230
Okay, never mind!

4868
02:42:34,470 --> 02:42:35,570
The elk won!

4869
02:42:36,050 --> 02:42:37,070
The elk won!

4870
02:42:39,790 --> 02:42:41,390
Oh, god!

4871
02:42:41,570 --> 02:42:42,510
The elk won!

4872
02:42:42,770 --> 02:42:44,270
I'm not that strong!

4873
02:42:44,970 --> 02:42:45,810
I'm just...

4874
02:42:45,810 --> 02:42:47,730
I'm so weak!

4875
02:42:51,110 --> 02:42:51,810
It's okay.

4876
02:42:52,610 --> 02:42:53,950
It's okay, it's okay.

4877
02:42:54,050 --> 02:42:54,750
We don't need that.

4878
02:42:54,950 --> 02:42:55,610
We don't need that.

4879
02:42:56,250 --> 02:42:58,410
Oh, there's a car... the moose?

4880
02:42:59,190 --> 02:43:00,070
A deer...

4881
02:43:02,010 --> 02:43:02,890
Territorial marking...

4882
02:43:03,470 --> 02:43:03,910
Done!

4883
02:43:05,070 --> 02:43:06,610
Are you feeding the children?

4884
02:43:07,130 --> 02:43:08,310
Yeah, I'm going back now.

4885
02:43:08,390 --> 02:43:09,290
I'm gonna warm some.

4886
02:43:09,590 --> 02:43:10,290
I'm just gonna eat.

4887
02:43:10,770 --> 02:43:12,830
I'll just go with the little ones.

4888
02:43:13,030 --> 02:43:13,710
Oh wait, that's a fox.

4889
02:43:13,810 --> 02:43:14,610
I don't care about the fox.

4890
02:43:15,230 --> 02:43:16,570
I can't eat the fox.

4891
02:43:19,790 --> 02:43:20,790
Hunt in a pack?

4892
02:43:21,170 --> 02:43:21,610
No!

4893
02:43:23,190 --> 02:43:24,650
Those are for suckers!

4894
02:43:24,650 --> 02:43:26,210
We get four kills!

4895
02:43:26,450 --> 02:43:26,770
What the heck?

4896
02:43:26,790 --> 02:43:27,150
Yeah!

4897
02:43:27,650 --> 02:43:28,890
Why get one kill?

4898
02:43:29,070 --> 02:43:30,870
We can get four kills!

4899
02:43:31,630 --> 02:43:32,430
Exactly!

4900
02:43:33,150 --> 02:43:33,730
Yeah!

4901
02:43:34,270 --> 02:43:36,530
We don't give a fuck about...

4902
02:43:37,070 --> 02:43:37,610
teamwork.

4903
02:43:37,630 --> 02:43:38,230
Come on, children!

4904
02:43:38,670 --> 02:43:39,870
It's warm time!

4905
02:43:40,830 --> 02:43:41,950
Who needs teamwork?

4906
02:43:41,950 --> 02:43:44,090
This is individualism country!

4907
02:43:44,810 --> 02:43:46,510
Welcome to America!

4908
02:43:47,050 --> 02:43:48,730
Welcome to America!

4909
02:43:49,010 --> 02:43:51,230
We are free to do our own hunting!

4910
02:43:51,350 --> 02:43:53,150
We're all special individually!

4911
02:43:54,090 --> 02:43:54,990
We're all special individually!

4912
02:43:54,990 --> 02:43:55,590
We're all special individually!

4913
02:43:58,370 --> 02:44:00,450
We're all special individuals!

4914
02:44:02,030 --> 02:44:02,670
We're all special individuals!

4915
02:44:02,670 --> 02:44:04,730
We're not here to think of it as a team!

4916
02:44:05,490 --> 02:44:07,490
That is for pussies!

4917
02:44:08,270 --> 02:44:09,610
Yeah, what the heck?

4918
02:44:09,630 --> 02:44:10,530
Yeah, what the fuck?

4919
02:44:10,590 --> 02:44:11,090
Teamwork?

4920
02:44:15,630 --> 02:44:16,270
Disgusting.

4921
02:44:16,450 --> 02:44:18,230
Yeah, so fucking disgusting.

4922
02:44:19,390 --> 02:44:20,390
Yeah, so fucking disgusting.

4923
02:44:20,390 --> 02:44:22,070
This is solo queue.

4924
02:44:22,810 --> 02:44:23,450
This is solo queue.

4925
02:44:24,730 --> 02:44:27,130
This is the solo queue experience.

4926
02:44:28,370 --> 02:44:29,730
Wait, there's a...

4927
02:44:29,730 --> 02:44:31,810
Me, children, I made many warm piles.

4928
02:44:32,170 --> 02:44:34,650
A pack can take down larger prey.

4929
02:44:34,790 --> 02:44:35,210
A pack can take down larger prey.

4930
02:44:35,210 --> 02:44:36,290
More food for all.

4931
02:44:36,430 --> 02:44:43,470
If a wolf cannot take a larger prey, then they... if a single wolf can't do it, then they're worthless to the pack.

4932
02:44:43,710 --> 02:44:45,570
They don't belong into the pack!

4933
02:44:45,630 --> 02:44:46,470
Yeah, they don't belong!

4934
02:44:47,210 --> 02:44:48,090
Banish them!

4935
02:44:50,190 --> 02:44:50,750
Okay.

4936
02:44:53,790 --> 02:44:58,630
They should each individually be able to take down a giant animal.

4937
02:44:58,750 --> 02:45:00,190
Then starve!

4938
02:45:00,690 --> 02:45:03,830
If you don't do it, you starve.

4939
02:45:04,890 --> 02:45:08,290
Like I said, he's the Canadian and the German.

4940
02:45:16,210 --> 02:45:18,250
We're American at heart!

4941
02:45:18,390 --> 02:45:19,390
You won't understand!

4942
02:45:19,830 --> 02:45:20,730
You don't understand!

4943
02:45:22,050 --> 02:45:23,570
We're American at heart!

4944
02:45:23,570 --> 02:45:23,930
Let us be!

4945
02:45:25,670 --> 02:45:27,030
You just don't understand.

4946
02:45:27,310 --> 02:45:29,110
It's supposed to be the country of freedom.

4947
02:45:29,230 --> 02:45:31,130
I'm free to identify as American.

4948
02:45:31,470 --> 02:45:32,430
Yeah, exactly.

4949
02:45:34,170 --> 02:45:34,650
Fucking...

4950
02:45:34,650 --> 02:45:36,030
Preach it, sister.

4951
02:45:40,170 --> 02:45:40,650
Preach.

4952
02:45:43,410 --> 02:45:44,470
Oh wait, that's a fox.

4953
02:45:44,590 --> 02:45:45,290
I don't care about fox.

4954
02:45:46,250 --> 02:45:48,630
What are you... Oh my god, I can kill a bear!

4955
02:45:48,710 --> 02:45:49,210
Baby bear!

4956
02:45:49,330 --> 02:45:49,970
Oh god!

4957
02:45:50,750 --> 02:45:51,150
Baby bear!

4958
02:45:51,490 --> 02:45:54,130
There's baby bear, but there's a mama bear!

4959
02:45:55,370 --> 02:45:56,870
I wanna eat the bear though.

4960
02:45:58,810 --> 02:46:01,810
Just kill the baby real quick and then run away from mama bear.

4961
02:46:02,250 --> 02:46:02,750
Okay.

4962
02:46:02,870 --> 02:46:04,010
Oh my god.

4963
02:46:04,730 --> 02:46:06,290
Can I please eat this?

4964
02:46:06,930 --> 02:46:07,710
Okay, nice.

4965
02:46:08,910 --> 02:46:09,730
Okay, nice.

4966
02:46:10,910 --> 02:46:13,190
I could eat the deer carcass.

4967
02:46:13,250 --> 02:46:13,410
Killed!

4968
02:46:15,490 --> 02:46:16,870
It's okay, I found the food.

4969
02:46:17,310 --> 02:46:19,990
Don't worry, I got more food for the children!

4970
02:46:21,290 --> 02:46:21,830
Yippee!

4971
02:46:22,270 --> 02:46:22,810
Yay!

4972
02:46:23,130 --> 02:46:24,990
I'm gonna finish this food!

4973
02:46:25,130 --> 02:46:25,930
Okay, I'm coming back.

4974
02:46:26,270 --> 02:46:27,910
Do not worry, dragon!

4975
02:46:28,890 --> 02:46:33,830
I know you haven't seen me in 20 years, but don't worry, I'm coming back.

4976
02:46:34,630 --> 02:46:35,390
Don't worry.

4977
02:46:36,010 --> 02:46:38,110
I'm coming back with more food.

4978
02:46:40,150 --> 02:46:40,690
I'm coming back with more food.

4979
02:46:40,690 --> 02:46:41,050
I'm coming back with more food.

4980
02:46:43,430 --> 02:46:45,110
Papa's coming back, child.

4981
02:46:45,530 --> 02:46:45,910
Papa's coming back, child.

4982
02:46:46,910 --> 02:46:48,230
Please don't forget my face!

4983
02:46:48,230 --> 02:46:49,310
Am I running too far off?

4984
02:46:49,470 --> 02:46:49,970
Wait, is this the end of the game?

4985
02:46:49,990 --> 02:46:51,070
Is this too far from home?

4986
02:46:51,710 --> 02:46:52,690
Wait, where are you?

4987
02:46:54,470 --> 02:46:55,230
At home.

4988
02:46:56,750 --> 02:46:57,130
Okay.

4989
02:46:57,570 --> 02:46:59,990
I'm trying to... I'm trying to feed them.

4990
02:47:01,230 --> 02:47:03,690
Oh, I'm gonna eat this food real fast.

4991
02:47:03,970 --> 02:47:04,150
Oh, I'm gonna eat this food real fast.

4992
02:47:04,150 --> 02:47:05,330
How can I feed them this?

4993
02:47:05,390 --> 02:47:05,990
Yum yum yum yum yum yum.

4994
02:47:07,750 --> 02:47:09,090
Yum yum yum yum yum yum yum.

4995
02:47:10,210 --> 02:47:10,990
How do I feed?

4996
02:47:11,030 --> 02:47:13,970
How do I fucking feed?

4997
02:47:14,130 --> 02:47:16,170
No, I don't wanna... I don't give a fuck about constipation.

4998
02:47:17,170 --> 02:47:17,550
First...

4999
02:47:19,330 --> 02:47:19,950
It's a bird!

5000
02:47:19,990 --> 02:47:21,210
It's a very serious topic, okay?

5001
02:47:22,810 --> 02:47:23,250
Wait!

5002
02:47:23,830 --> 02:47:24,550
Oh my god!

5003
02:47:24,630 --> 02:47:25,350
We're getting invaded!

5004
02:47:26,190 --> 02:47:26,630
Invaded?

5005
02:47:26,690 --> 02:47:26,990
Invaded?

5006
02:47:27,010 --> 02:47:27,690
I'll be in the cave!

5007
02:47:30,090 --> 02:47:31,250
You guys go!

5008
02:47:33,710 --> 02:47:34,750
I see him!

5009
02:47:34,850 --> 02:47:35,170
I see him!

5010
02:47:36,350 --> 02:47:36,930
Put up!

5011
02:47:37,330 --> 02:47:37,770
Constipation!

5012
02:47:37,870 --> 02:47:38,290
Go in!

5013
02:47:40,850 --> 02:47:41,290
Die!

5014
02:47:41,930 --> 02:47:43,130
Are you fighting them?

5015
02:47:43,670 --> 02:47:44,610
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

5016
02:47:44,670 --> 02:47:45,230
We got this.

5017
02:47:45,290 --> 02:47:45,650
Easy!

5018
02:47:46,030 --> 02:47:46,850
Oh my god, good job.

5019
02:47:46,950 --> 02:47:47,910
I'm gonna supervise.

5020
02:47:49,170 --> 02:47:50,270
Good job, guys.

5021
02:47:50,470 --> 02:47:50,610
Good job, guys.

5022
02:47:50,610 --> 02:47:51,330
You're doing great.

5023
02:47:52,470 --> 02:47:54,150
Don't let him run.

5024
02:47:54,510 --> 02:47:55,050
No!

5025
02:47:55,490 --> 02:47:56,050
Yeah!

5026
02:47:59,630 --> 02:48:00,730
Nice, alright.

5027
02:48:01,050 --> 02:48:01,390
See?

5028
02:48:01,550 --> 02:48:01,970
Perfect.

5029
02:48:02,290 --> 02:48:03,590
No witnesses.

5030
02:48:04,430 --> 02:48:05,790
I'm so proud of us.

5031
02:48:06,290 --> 02:48:06,850
Woooo!

5032
02:48:21,910 --> 02:48:23,310
I have a full belly!

5033
02:48:23,330 --> 02:48:24,270
I wanna feed you!

5034
02:48:25,370 --> 02:48:26,230
Oh, there we go.

5035
02:48:27,330 --> 02:48:28,230
Okay, I fed.

5036
02:48:30,090 --> 02:48:31,190
Wait, where's Dragoon?

5037
02:48:31,510 --> 02:48:32,610
Dragoon, why are you over there?

5038
02:48:33,730 --> 02:48:34,910
Who the fuck put you there?

5039
02:48:36,110 --> 02:48:36,890
Get over here.

5040
02:48:37,890 --> 02:48:38,290
Dragoon!

5041
02:48:38,490 --> 02:48:39,050
Yes, go home.

5042
02:48:39,290 --> 02:48:40,210
Yes, go inside.

5043
02:48:40,310 --> 02:48:40,910
Go eat.

5044
02:48:40,990 --> 02:48:41,330
E.P.

5045
02:48:41,330 --> 02:48:41,470
time.

5046
02:48:41,970 --> 02:48:43,670
You have lots of growing to do.

5047
02:48:43,750 --> 02:48:44,010
E.P.

5048
02:48:44,030 --> 02:48:44,210
time.

5049
02:48:44,750 --> 02:48:45,910
Dragoon, what are you doing?

5050
02:48:46,230 --> 02:48:46,230
Invited!

5051
02:48:46,290 --> 02:48:46,690
Yes!

5052
02:48:47,650 --> 02:48:48,050
Okay.

5053
02:48:48,690 --> 02:48:49,310
Go eat.

5054
02:48:49,370 --> 02:48:49,470
E.P.

5055
02:48:49,470 --> 02:48:49,650
time.

5056
02:48:50,190 --> 02:48:50,590
Eat.

5057
02:48:51,410 --> 02:48:53,030
See, they have full stomachs.

5058
02:48:53,030 --> 02:48:53,310
Yes!

5059
02:48:53,370 --> 02:48:54,850
Oh my goodness, they're almost done.

5060
02:48:56,190 --> 02:48:57,610
What are you doing with my child?

5061
02:48:58,550 --> 02:48:59,330
Come on!

5062
02:49:01,650 --> 02:49:02,710
Where's your child?

5063
02:49:03,270 --> 02:49:04,310
What are you doing?

5064
02:49:04,550 --> 02:49:05,890
My child, let him down!

5065
02:49:08,210 --> 02:49:09,810
Let go of my child!

5066
02:49:10,750 --> 02:49:13,070
Or I swear, better Dragoon's gonna get it.

5067
02:49:13,890 --> 02:49:14,370
Can't grow, he can't eat.

5068
02:49:15,670 --> 02:49:19,610
If you don't let go of my child, better Dragoon's gonna get it right now.

5069
02:49:21,930 --> 02:49:23,910
Better Dragoon's gonna get it so hard.

5070
02:49:25,770 --> 02:49:27,590
Say goodbye to your child.

5071
02:49:28,230 --> 02:49:28,970
Alright, eat.

5072
02:49:29,250 --> 02:49:30,570
Are you guys 15 pounds?

5073
02:49:31,110 --> 02:49:32,450
Good thing we have food at home.

5074
02:49:32,630 --> 02:49:33,630
They're 13 pounds.

5075
02:49:33,750 --> 02:49:34,490
You're so close!

5076
02:49:34,870 --> 02:49:36,150
We need two more pounds!

5077
02:49:37,330 --> 02:49:38,390
Come on, eat!

5078
02:49:38,750 --> 02:49:42,350
Eat, don't poop and you will get those pounds quickly!

5079
02:49:42,950 --> 02:49:43,690
Hurry up!

5080
02:49:43,990 --> 02:49:45,610
We need you to eat!

5081
02:49:47,430 --> 02:49:49,390
We've been at this for three hours!

5082
02:49:49,470 --> 02:49:50,650
Why are you still so small?

5083
02:49:53,290 --> 02:49:56,690
How dare you don't grow to an adult within three hours?

5084
02:49:56,810 --> 02:49:57,330
What the fuck?

5085
02:49:57,330 --> 02:49:59,510
Yeah, what the fuck is wrong with- Poor Dragoon!

5086
02:49:59,830 --> 02:50:00,350
Eat,

5087
02:50:04,990 --> 02:50:06,830
Dragoon, eat!

5088
02:50:09,390 --> 02:50:12,030
Yeah, it's constipation!

5089
02:50:12,270 --> 02:50:12,730
Good boy!

5090
02:50:13,290 --> 02:50:14,290
Okay, I have to eat!

5091
02:50:14,510 --> 02:50:15,810
It's EP time too.

5092
02:50:17,710 --> 02:50:20,070
Wait, I have to do...

5093
02:50:22,230 --> 02:50:23,450
One more playtime.

5094
02:50:23,450 --> 02:50:23,530
One more playtime.

5095
02:50:25,770 --> 02:50:27,130
Guys, it's EP time.

5096
02:50:27,450 --> 02:50:27,750
EP!

5097
02:50:29,290 --> 02:50:30,210
EP time!

5098
02:50:30,590 --> 02:50:31,810
I lost Dragoon.

5099
02:50:31,850 --> 02:50:32,510
I hope he's okay.

5100
02:50:36,350 --> 02:50:37,390
Where's Dragoon?

5101
02:50:37,390 --> 02:50:37,890
No one knows!

5102
02:50:44,700 --> 02:50:46,100
I don't like this.

5103
02:50:46,140 --> 02:50:48,320
Dragoon is like walking further and further away.

5104
02:50:52,100 --> 02:50:53,580
It's like, goodbye mother.

5105
02:50:55,440 --> 02:50:57,160
Thank you for nourishing me.

5106
02:50:57,220 --> 02:50:58,740
I was very concerned.

5107
02:51:02,700 --> 02:51:03,740
Oh hey, look!

5108
02:51:03,820 --> 02:51:04,820
The loading screen!

5109
02:51:06,260 --> 02:51:06,820
Yippee!

5110
02:51:07,960 --> 02:51:09,460
I don't have one this time.

5111
02:51:09,720 --> 02:51:10,620
Oh, I have it.

5112
02:51:11,140 --> 02:51:13,200
My Dragoon is becoming too independent.

5113
02:51:13,620 --> 02:51:14,320
I don't like it.

5114
02:51:14,980 --> 02:51:15,380
No!

5115
02:51:15,540 --> 02:51:16,400
He's running off!

5116
02:51:16,660 --> 02:51:17,100
No!

5117
02:51:17,320 --> 02:51:18,300
You're not supposed to-!

5118
02:51:18,320 --> 02:51:21,140
My Dragoon has become ill!

5119
02:51:23,380 --> 02:51:25,540
Why are you sick?!

5120
02:51:25,540 --> 02:51:27,780
Why are you sick?!

5121
02:51:27,780 --> 02:51:28,000
Why are you sick?!

5122
02:51:28,000 --> 02:51:28,640
Sick puppy!

5123
02:51:29,940 --> 02:51:30,440
Why?!

5124
02:51:32,180 --> 02:51:35,360
Who made you sick?!

5125
02:51:35,360 --> 02:51:35,820
Who made you sick?!

5126
02:51:35,820 --> 02:51:36,220
There's an eagle!

5127
02:51:36,920 --> 02:51:37,920
Oh shit!

5128
02:51:37,920 --> 02:51:38,320
Wait, wait, wait!

5129
02:51:39,940 --> 02:51:40,940
Go inside!

5130
02:51:41,080 --> 02:51:41,500
Go inside!

5131
02:51:41,640 --> 02:51:42,340
Wait, wait, boys.

5132
02:51:42,580 --> 02:51:43,140
Go inside!

5133
02:51:43,220 --> 02:51:43,640
Go home!

5134
02:51:43,680 --> 02:51:44,620
Go into the den!

5135
02:51:45,440 --> 02:51:46,500
Go into the den!

5136
02:51:46,640 --> 02:51:46,880
Go!

5137
02:51:47,260 --> 02:51:47,760
Go!

5138
02:51:47,840 --> 02:51:48,100
Go!

5139
02:51:48,320 --> 02:51:48,700
Go in!

5140
02:51:48,780 --> 02:51:49,840
Go in!

5141
02:51:50,140 --> 02:51:51,200
Oh my god!

5142
02:51:51,320 --> 02:51:52,140
Oh my god!

5143
02:51:52,180 --> 02:51:52,620
He's okay!

5144
02:51:52,980 --> 02:51:53,460
Please!

5145
02:51:54,180 --> 02:51:54,580
No!

5146
02:51:55,000 --> 02:51:57,760
Please go inside!

5147
02:51:58,080 --> 02:51:58,440
Please!

5148
02:51:58,920 --> 02:51:59,900
The eagle is coming down!

5149
02:52:01,480 --> 02:52:01,960
No!

5150
02:52:04,040 --> 02:52:04,860
He's looking!

5151
02:52:05,760 --> 02:52:07,380
He's looking at the children!

5152
02:52:07,560 --> 02:52:08,260
Oh, he's flying away!

5153
02:52:08,440 --> 02:52:08,840
He's flying away!

5154
02:52:08,960 --> 02:52:09,760
I picked up constipation.

5155
02:52:09,860 --> 02:52:10,180
Is that enough?

5156
02:52:10,420 --> 02:52:11,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5157
02:52:12,060 --> 02:52:12,540
They're...

5158
02:52:13,500 --> 02:52:14,200
It's fine!

5159
02:52:14,320 --> 02:52:14,780
Oh fuck.

5160
02:52:14,780 --> 02:52:15,980
They're flying around!

5161
02:52:16,220 --> 02:52:17,240
I'm so scared!

5162
02:52:17,860 --> 02:52:19,420
I don't wanna put it down!

5163
02:52:19,540 --> 02:52:20,240
I'm scared!

5164
02:52:20,900 --> 02:52:21,640
Come away!

5165
02:52:21,740 --> 02:52:22,160
Stupid bird!

5166
02:52:22,160 --> 02:52:23,200
I'm gonna eat my food.

5167
02:52:24,660 --> 02:52:25,600
Oh, it gave up!

5168
02:52:25,620 --> 02:52:26,060
It gave up!

5169
02:52:26,820 --> 02:52:31,240
See, even though my dragoon is sick right now, at least he's not stupid.

5170
02:52:35,840 --> 02:52:37,240
He's not stupid!

5171
02:52:37,760 --> 02:52:38,560
He knew!

5172
02:52:38,700 --> 02:52:39,920
He knew when to hide!

5173
02:52:40,000 --> 02:52:41,320
Good job, dragoon!

5174
02:52:41,360 --> 02:52:45,920
You might be sick right now, but at least you know when to go inside.

5175
02:52:46,820 --> 02:52:47,900
That's my child!

5176
02:52:48,100 --> 02:52:49,100
I'm gonna get my food to vomit.

5177
02:52:49,320 --> 02:52:51,060
The constipation just ran away!

5178
02:52:51,360 --> 02:52:52,180
Like, what?

5179
02:52:52,800 --> 02:52:54,980
You just panicked and sprinted!

5180
02:52:57,480 --> 02:52:58,980
Like, what was that for?

5181
02:52:59,300 --> 02:52:59,480
Like, what was that for?

5182
02:53:00,660 --> 02:53:00,940
Aqua!

5183
02:53:01,180 --> 02:53:03,880
Dizzy, your fucking puppy is so malnourished!

5184
02:53:04,040 --> 02:53:06,260
Everybody else is 4 to almost 15 pounds!

5185
02:53:06,360 --> 02:53:07,360
Yours is still 15!

5186
02:53:07,860 --> 02:53:09,360
Feed your fucking...

5187
02:53:09,360 --> 02:53:11,220
Feed your child!

5188
02:53:11,480 --> 02:53:11,720
Feed your child!

5189
02:53:16,760 --> 02:53:17,960
Go away from my food!

5190
02:53:19,000 --> 02:53:19,500
Go away from my food!

5191
02:53:19,500 --> 02:53:19,860
My food.

5192
02:53:20,080 --> 02:53:21,300
Leave it!

5193
02:53:22,500 --> 02:53:23,500
Good dragoon.

5194
02:53:23,580 --> 02:53:24,700
You're socialized.

5195
02:53:24,860 --> 02:53:29,860
You're socialized enough that you know when to hide in the cave when there's an eagle.

5196
02:53:30,160 --> 02:53:31,580
Unlike some children.

5197
02:53:32,580 --> 02:53:34,060
Unlike some children.

5198
02:53:35,740 --> 02:53:38,440
I wonder whose child just sprinted away.

5199
02:53:38,560 --> 02:53:40,300
Food, food, food, food, food, food, food, food!

5200
02:53:40,460 --> 02:53:40,920
Oh my goodness.

5201
02:53:41,200 --> 02:53:41,580
Look.

5202
02:53:42,940 --> 02:53:46,080
He's just... his immune system isn't as good as the others!

5203
02:53:46,260 --> 02:53:47,060
It's not his fault!

5204
02:53:47,380 --> 02:53:49,200
It's just poor genetics, okay?

5205
02:53:50,060 --> 02:53:50,960
Poor genetics?

5206
02:53:51,160 --> 02:53:53,420
I just passed on somebody should use genetics.

5207
02:53:53,480 --> 02:53:54,200
What can I say about that?

5208
02:53:54,200 --> 02:53:55,020
It's his mom's fault.

5209
02:53:55,260 --> 02:53:57,240
I'm a strong genetic wolf.

5210
02:54:00,940 --> 02:54:02,440
It's not my fault.

5211
02:54:02,580 --> 02:54:03,900
I blame the mother.

5212
02:54:05,260 --> 02:54:07,380
I blame whoever is the mother.

5213
02:54:07,580 --> 02:54:08,740
My genes...

5214
02:54:08,740 --> 02:54:12,780
gave him the best possible...

5215
02:54:12,920 --> 02:54:13,120
genes.

5216
02:54:13,740 --> 02:54:14,440
He's tired!

5217
02:54:14,620 --> 02:54:15,100
Let's go!

5218
02:54:18,000 --> 02:54:19,260
Nom nom nom nom nom nom!

5219
02:54:19,260 --> 02:54:19,880
Oh, I need to eat too.

5220
02:54:20,000 --> 02:54:21,660
Om nom nom nom nom nom nom nom!

5221
02:54:24,140 --> 02:54:24,580
Alright.

5222
02:54:25,200 --> 02:54:26,180
Come on, come on!

5223
02:54:28,300 --> 02:54:30,940
I have to chase this food for so long!

5224
02:54:34,660 --> 02:54:36,380
Nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom!

5225
02:54:36,380 --> 02:54:36,760
Alright, let's see.

5226
02:54:38,180 --> 02:54:40,800
Mine needs 0.5 more pounds.

5227
02:54:40,860 --> 02:54:42,320
And then he's... better dragoon!

5228
02:54:43,280 --> 02:54:45,100
Better dragoon needs to stop eating!

5229
02:54:45,380 --> 02:54:46,600
He's gonna get too plump!

5230
02:54:48,100 --> 02:54:49,220
Too plump!

5231
02:54:49,220 --> 02:54:49,300
Too plump!

5232
02:54:50,600 --> 02:54:52,640
Maybe our children got switched.

5233
02:54:53,240 --> 02:54:57,160
And like, but a dragoon is actually my child, cause I'm a plump little boy.

5234
02:54:57,500 --> 02:54:57,940
Ha ha ha ha!

5235
02:54:58,060 --> 02:54:59,220
Ha ha ha ha!

5236
02:55:00,340 --> 02:55:02,940
You gotta stop overfeeding your kid!

5237
02:55:03,620 --> 02:55:04,740
Dokililly lovechild!

5238
02:55:05,820 --> 02:55:07,920
You gotta stop overfeeding him!

5239
02:55:08,360 --> 02:55:09,260
Ha ha ha ha!

5240
02:55:10,160 --> 02:55:12,140
Let the other pups grow!

5241
02:55:12,760 --> 02:55:15,180
Yeah, you're denying our growth.

5242
02:55:15,520 --> 02:55:16,640
Yeah, exactly.

5243
02:55:17,320 --> 02:55:19,400
This is why my dragoon is ill!

5244
02:55:19,920 --> 02:55:20,260
This is why my dragoon is ill!

5245
02:55:20,260 --> 02:55:22,400
Bro, this is why your puppy's a beast.

5246
02:55:22,860 --> 02:55:23,780
This is why.

5247
02:55:23,900 --> 02:55:25,480
You need a fucking...

5248
02:55:26,900 --> 02:55:28,820
Stop shaming the puppy!

5249
02:55:29,960 --> 02:55:34,100
Bro, he's like, two pounds heavier than all the other puppies!

5250
02:55:34,440 --> 02:55:34,460
Bro, he's like, two pounds heavier than all the other puppies!

5251
02:55:34,460 --> 02:55:37,780
It's not the average weight of a puppy!

5252
02:55:38,240 --> 02:55:39,080
Jesus!

5253
02:55:40,120 --> 02:55:42,520
Bro, we need to put that puppy on a treadmill!

5254
02:55:43,480 --> 02:55:44,600
A treadmill?

5255
02:55:45,160 --> 02:55:45,720
Bro!

5256
02:55:46,380 --> 02:55:48,240
That puppy needs to be healthy!

5257
02:55:48,620 --> 02:55:50,500
It's a baby fat!

5258
02:55:51,180 --> 02:55:52,420
Ha ha ha ha!

5259
02:55:52,520 --> 02:55:53,800
He's just fluffy!

5260
02:55:54,080 --> 02:55:55,400
He's just fluffy!

5261
02:55:55,500 --> 02:55:57,820
It's just a baby fat talking about.

5262
02:55:58,520 --> 02:55:59,780
Dragoon, why are you...

5263
02:55:59,780 --> 02:56:01,720
Please socialize with the other puppies!

5264
02:56:01,820 --> 02:56:02,360
What are you doing?

5265
02:56:03,740 --> 02:56:05,540
Why are you away from them?

5266
02:56:06,740 --> 02:56:07,300
Socialize!

5267
02:56:08,400 --> 02:56:12,200
I shall follow the footsteps of Sasuke.

5268
02:56:12,340 --> 02:56:12,740
I shall follow the footsteps of Sasuke.

5269
02:56:12,740 --> 02:56:12,960
Dragoon, please.

5270
02:56:13,260 --> 02:56:15,500
I trained you better to be social.

5271
02:56:15,720 --> 02:56:16,760
Why are you a loner?

5272
02:56:16,840 --> 02:56:17,860
I don't understand.

5273
02:56:19,960 --> 02:56:21,840
Mother, you wouldn't get me.

5274
02:56:21,880 --> 02:56:23,500
You don't understand, mother.

5275
02:56:25,660 --> 02:56:27,600
You're just like the other parents.

5276
02:56:29,720 --> 02:56:31,560
Dragoon, stop walking away!

5277
02:56:31,860 --> 02:56:33,380
Play with these children!

5278
02:56:33,620 --> 02:56:34,720
You all grew up together!

5279
02:56:37,480 --> 02:56:38,220
There's two of them.

5280
02:56:38,240 --> 02:56:39,400
You're turning into a gamer!

5281
02:56:39,600 --> 02:56:41,120
Ha ha ha ha!

5282
02:56:41,760 --> 02:56:42,400
No!

5283
02:56:42,540 --> 02:56:44,980
Social distancing because of sickness?

5284
02:56:45,460 --> 02:56:46,020
No!

5285
02:56:48,160 --> 02:56:52,300
I didn't want you to become like me, Dragoon!

5286
02:56:52,400 --> 02:56:56,240
I tried everything I could to raise you right!

5287
02:56:56,660 --> 02:56:58,000
Ha ha ha ha!

5288
02:56:58,200 --> 02:56:59,820
And for what?

5289
02:57:00,140 --> 02:57:01,500
Ha ha ha ha!

5290
02:57:01,820 --> 02:57:03,300
I like how...

5291
02:57:03,300 --> 02:57:06,500
I love how he's also like...

5292
02:57:07,300 --> 02:57:08,640
He's like emo as fuck.

5293
02:57:08,700 --> 02:57:11,860
Because he's like the only puppy that's like a black puppy.

5294
02:57:12,100 --> 02:57:13,900
So he's super emo right now.

5295
02:57:14,320 --> 02:57:15,000
Ha ha ha ha!

5296
02:57:16,560 --> 02:57:18,300
Mom, don't talk to me!

5297
02:57:18,460 --> 02:57:20,240
It's not a phase, mom!

5298
02:57:20,920 --> 02:57:22,280
It's not a phase, mom!

5299
02:57:22,940 --> 02:57:23,980
Oh my god, mom!

5300
02:57:24,040 --> 02:57:25,320
You're embarrassing me!

5301
02:57:25,880 --> 02:57:26,600
Oh my god!

5302
02:57:26,620 --> 02:57:27,480
Time to leave soon!

5303
02:57:27,840 --> 02:57:29,460
Almost all your pups have grown 15 pounds.

5304
02:57:29,620 --> 02:57:32,840
Very soon it will be time to leave the den and travel to your summertime home base.

5305
02:57:32,840 --> 02:57:34,300
Called a rendezvous site.

5306
02:57:34,400 --> 02:57:37,420
Start planning your trip by opening a world map which now shows.

5307
02:57:37,580 --> 02:57:40,180
Then feed your pups to get the smallest one over 15 pounds.

5308
02:57:40,360 --> 02:57:41,660
Yeah, that's really far.

5309
02:57:42,020 --> 02:57:42,960
Ha ha ha ha!

5310
02:57:44,320 --> 02:57:45,700
That is some...

5311
02:57:45,700 --> 02:57:46,660
That is...

5312
02:57:46,660 --> 02:57:47,520
Quite a distance.

5313
02:57:47,720 --> 02:57:50,320
That's pretty far.

5314
02:57:50,520 --> 02:57:52,100
Wait, no, there's one really close by!

5315
02:57:52,440 --> 02:57:55,120
Yeah, yeah, we can take them there, right?

5316
02:57:55,480 --> 02:57:56,340
Yeah, easily!

5317
02:57:57,140 --> 02:57:58,040
That's not that far.

5318
02:57:58,320 --> 02:58:00,890
Yeah, yeah, we'll call it when we get to the rendezvous.

5319
02:58:01,980 --> 02:58:02,480
Ha ha ha!

5320
02:58:02,840 --> 02:58:03,500
Ha ha ha!

5321
02:58:05,020 --> 02:58:07,940
We'll call it when we get to the rendezvous site.

5322
02:58:08,400 --> 02:58:09,820
Ha ha ha!

5323
02:58:10,560 --> 02:58:11,520
It's not that far.

5324
02:58:12,060 --> 02:58:15,260
Just do a little wham and then, like, what's the goal?

5325
02:58:15,380 --> 02:58:15,920
Dragelon, please!

5326
02:58:16,520 --> 02:58:18,240
Please, their friends are over here!

5327
02:58:18,760 --> 02:58:20,200
Please, Dragelon, stop!

5328
02:58:21,180 --> 02:58:24,800
Bro, my puppy doesn't even look like a fucking puppy.

5329
02:58:25,020 --> 02:58:25,960
He looks like a cat.

5330
02:58:26,680 --> 02:58:28,780
He actually looks...

5331
02:58:28,780 --> 02:58:30,160
He looks like a fucking cat.

5332
02:58:30,880 --> 02:58:31,380
Please.

5333
02:58:32,840 --> 02:58:33,340
Please, don't socialize.

5334
02:58:33,840 --> 02:58:35,200
He got my tail!

5335
02:58:36,640 --> 02:58:37,140
Alright,

5336
02:58:41,440 --> 02:58:42,180
who is still...

5337
02:58:42,180 --> 02:58:43,980
Mine's almost 15 pounds.

5338
02:58:44,180 --> 02:58:45,560
He just needs two more.

5339
02:58:45,920 --> 02:58:47,120
Okay, Dragelon, here.

5340
02:58:47,460 --> 02:58:48,760
I have food for you.

5341
02:58:48,900 --> 02:58:51,200
I have food for you.

5342
02:58:53,900 --> 02:58:55,600
Oh, he's behind me!

5343
02:58:56,100 --> 02:58:57,160
Oh, he's eeppy.

5344
02:58:58,380 --> 02:58:59,720
Stop playing with the stick!

5345
02:58:59,720 --> 02:59:00,460
Stick!

5346
02:59:00,460 --> 02:59:01,760
There's other things to play!

5347
02:59:02,620 --> 02:59:04,860
It's like the stick is like the video game.

5348
02:59:06,660 --> 02:59:10,840
Mom, I don't wanna play with the other paws.

5349
02:59:10,980 --> 02:59:12,060
I wanna play with my stick.

5350
02:59:12,700 --> 02:59:15,040
God, Mom, I can't just pause stick playing.

5351
02:59:15,380 --> 02:59:16,240
You don't understand.

5352
02:59:18,020 --> 02:59:19,640
You don't understand, Mom.

5353
02:59:19,940 --> 02:59:20,620
You don't understand.

5354
02:59:20,780 --> 02:59:21,420
Oh my God, it's an animal!

5355
02:59:21,540 --> 02:59:22,200
Oh, dragon!

5356
02:59:22,900 --> 02:59:23,940
Oh, blaggy!

5357
02:59:25,000 --> 02:59:25,520
No!

5358
02:59:25,980 --> 02:59:26,780
Dragon, please!

5359
02:59:27,140 --> 02:59:28,320
Stop playing with the stick!

5360
02:59:28,320 --> 02:59:29,020
Dragon!

5361
02:59:31,800 --> 02:59:32,720
That's right, that's right!

5362
02:59:32,840 --> 02:59:33,640
Dragon, no, no, no!

5363
02:59:33,640 --> 02:59:34,300
Don't mess with me!

5364
02:59:34,460 --> 02:59:35,300
Don't mess with me!

5365
02:59:35,800 --> 02:59:36,800
Go, go, go, go!

5366
02:59:37,300 --> 02:59:37,700
Go!

5367
02:59:38,560 --> 02:59:39,660
Play with the other kids!

5368
02:59:41,280 --> 02:59:42,360
Okay, I'm gonna help.

5369
02:59:42,440 --> 02:59:43,840
That's right, that's right, that's right!

5370
02:59:43,880 --> 02:59:44,140
That's right!

5371
02:59:45,800 --> 02:59:46,600
Get over here!

5372
02:59:47,220 --> 02:59:47,820
Get out!

5373
02:59:49,220 --> 02:59:50,400
Get outta here!

5374
02:59:50,740 --> 02:59:51,360
Get out!

5375
02:59:52,260 --> 02:59:52,660
Nice.

5376
02:59:52,840 --> 02:59:55,340
Wait, they're junior high school... Okay, that's not my child.

5377
02:59:58,740 --> 02:59:59,360
No, wait!

5378
02:59:59,420 --> 02:59:59,800
Oh, never mind.

5379
03:00:00,000 --> 03:00:00,280
I don't care.

5380
03:00:00,300 --> 03:00:01,380
Yeah, yeah, that's not mine.

5381
03:00:03,840 --> 03:00:05,100
That's not my kid.

5382
03:00:05,280 --> 03:00:05,500
Oh, who cares?

5383
03:00:05,940 --> 03:00:07,560
Yeah, that, that... Oh, thank God.

5384
03:00:08,380 --> 03:00:10,740
As long as it's not Dragoon, it's fine.

5385
03:00:11,080 --> 03:00:11,620
Come on.

5386
03:00:11,700 --> 03:00:12,500
Eat a little bit.

5387
03:00:12,740 --> 03:00:14,620
You just need two more pounds and you'll be fine.

5388
03:00:15,180 --> 03:00:17,720
You'll be big and strong and be alpha just like me.

5389
03:00:17,900 --> 03:00:18,220
Come on!

5390
03:00:18,340 --> 03:00:19,700
You need four more pounds!

5391
03:00:19,700 --> 03:00:21,060
Just stop sleeping!

5392
03:00:21,280 --> 03:00:21,460
Eat!

5393
03:00:21,500 --> 03:00:23,040
Okay, Aqua needs to keep eating.

5394
03:00:23,120 --> 03:00:24,380
Aqua has a full pound?

5395
03:00:24,920 --> 03:00:25,320
Dizzy!

5396
03:00:25,320 --> 03:00:25,400
Dizzy!

5397
03:00:26,460 --> 03:00:28,880
Your child is a runt!

5398
03:00:29,240 --> 03:00:31,080
We should have let that child... Damn!

5399
03:00:31,080 --> 03:00:32,580
Your child is anorexic.

5400
03:00:32,920 --> 03:00:33,540
What the heck?

5401
03:00:33,640 --> 03:00:33,780
Bro!

5402
03:00:34,000 --> 03:00:34,580
What happened?

5403
03:00:35,220 --> 03:00:36,280
Feed your child!

5404
03:00:36,660 --> 03:00:38,700
Don't let better Dragoon take all the food!

5405
03:00:42,420 --> 03:00:43,980
Wake that child up!

5406
03:00:43,980 --> 03:00:43,980
Oh my God, I'm constipated.

5407
03:00:44,000 --> 03:00:44,760
Please wake up!

5408
03:00:44,760 --> 03:00:45,540
Wake him up!

5409
03:00:46,980 --> 03:00:48,000
Please wake up!

5410
03:00:48,000 --> 03:00:48,560
You have to eat!

5411
03:00:49,260 --> 03:00:51,860
Dizzy, wake your child up and make her eat!

5412
03:00:55,320 --> 03:00:56,440
She doesn't need to sleep.

5413
03:00:56,540 --> 03:00:58,520
She needs to put weight in that body.

5414
03:00:59,220 --> 03:01:01,400
Don't constipation has so much sleep.

5415
03:01:01,520 --> 03:01:02,280
Just wake up!

5416
03:01:02,280 --> 03:01:04,140
It's like 60% sleep.

5417
03:01:04,200 --> 03:01:05,120
Bro, what the fuck?

5418
03:01:05,460 --> 03:01:06,920
Girl, you have one pound left!

5419
03:01:09,060 --> 03:01:10,720
Don't wake the child.

5420
03:01:10,780 --> 03:01:11,380
It's time to be...

5421
03:01:11,380 --> 03:01:11,420
Come on!

5422
03:01:11,420 --> 03:01:11,940
Here, eat!

5423
03:01:14,000 --> 03:01:15,360
I'm gonna wake your child.

5424
03:01:15,580 --> 03:01:18,140
Oh my God, your child is so fucking sleepy.

5425
03:01:19,180 --> 03:01:21,720
Yeah, he's like passed out, dude.

5426
03:01:21,820 --> 03:01:23,140
Bro, I'm sleeping now.

5427
03:01:23,200 --> 03:01:23,980
It's sleeping time.

5428
03:01:25,320 --> 03:01:27,660
Me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me.

5429
03:01:30,480 --> 03:01:32,380
Me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me.

5430
03:01:32,380 --> 03:01:32,620
Me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me.

5431
03:01:37,320 --> 03:01:37,680
Sorry,

5432
03:01:43,820 --> 03:01:44,500
am I snoring?

5433
03:01:45,720 --> 03:01:48,740
So it's like when VTubers are not the best parents?

5434
03:01:51,600 --> 03:01:52,940
Who would have thought it?

5435
03:01:53,500 --> 03:01:54,500
Dragoon's healthy again!

5436
03:01:55,120 --> 03:01:55,760
Oh, he's eating!

5437
03:01:55,940 --> 03:01:56,260
They're eating!

5438
03:01:57,560 --> 03:02:00,500
Your pups have grown to 15 pounds!

5439
03:02:01,220 --> 03:02:01,700
Yes!

5440
03:02:02,240 --> 03:02:02,720
Yay!

5441
03:02:06,520 --> 03:02:08,240
Journey to summer home!

5442
03:02:09,520 --> 03:02:11,540
They no longer need the dens.

5443
03:02:11,740 --> 03:02:13,000
Now it's time to journey.

5444
03:02:13,480 --> 03:02:15,720
Take them to your home base for the summer.

5445
03:02:15,780 --> 03:02:17,100
You need a spot with sun and shades.

5446
03:02:17,360 --> 03:02:18,740
Alright, pick them up.

5447
03:02:18,800 --> 03:02:19,180
It's time!

5448
03:02:20,400 --> 03:02:23,760
Mewtwo must select a new site on the map, then lead them.

5449
03:02:23,920 --> 03:02:25,940
Find a patch of wolf to tell your pups to hide.

5450
03:02:25,940 --> 03:02:27,480
They will be safe while they're away.

5451
03:02:27,620 --> 03:02:29,140
Okay, I'm just gonna pick them up.

5452
03:02:29,180 --> 03:02:29,520
Fuck this.

5453
03:02:30,200 --> 03:02:31,120
Yeah, fuck it.

5454
03:02:31,120 --> 03:02:32,060
Just pick them up.

5455
03:02:33,200 --> 03:02:34,400
Where's the rendezvous spot?

5456
03:02:34,540 --> 03:02:35,800
Is that the grass?

5457
03:02:36,920 --> 03:02:37,840
I think so.

5458
03:02:38,200 --> 03:02:38,500
Right?

5459
03:02:38,620 --> 03:02:39,380
That is, right?

5460
03:02:39,600 --> 03:02:40,680
Yeah, that's the grass.

5461
03:02:40,880 --> 03:02:43,460
Okay, I'm gonna go... Yeah, there's one that's super close.

5462
03:02:44,060 --> 03:02:44,460
Yeah.

5463
03:02:45,340 --> 03:02:45,740
Alright.

5464
03:02:47,540 --> 03:02:48,380
Get over here.

5465
03:02:48,640 --> 03:02:49,380
Get over here!

5466
03:02:49,440 --> 03:02:50,100
I'm gonna pick you up!

5467
03:02:51,960 --> 03:02:52,360
Dragon!

5468
03:02:53,660 --> 03:02:54,600
And he's like, Mom!

5469
03:02:54,760 --> 03:02:55,920
Those are picking me up!

5470
03:02:55,940 --> 03:02:56,620
This is for kids!

5471
03:02:57,600 --> 03:02:58,980
Mom, don't pick me up!

5472
03:02:59,060 --> 03:02:59,980
Don't pick me up!

5473
03:03:00,120 --> 03:03:01,080
This is embarrassing!

5474
03:03:02,280 --> 03:03:02,720
Mom!

5475
03:03:03,060 --> 03:03:05,120
I'm grown up now!

5476
03:03:05,560 --> 03:03:08,080
I'm two months old now, Mom!

5477
03:03:08,500 --> 03:03:08,940
Mom!

5478
03:03:10,440 --> 03:03:12,000
You're embarrassing me, Mom!

5479
03:03:12,080 --> 03:03:13,240
Not in front of my friends, Mom!

5480
03:03:13,240 --> 03:03:14,340
Not in front of my friends!

5481
03:03:14,380 --> 03:03:14,860
Oh, God!

5482
03:03:17,060 --> 03:03:17,500
Mom!

5483
03:03:17,760 --> 03:03:18,720
You wouldn't get it!

5484
03:03:18,800 --> 03:03:20,040
You don't understand, Mom!

5485
03:03:20,600 --> 03:03:20,960
God!

5486
03:03:22,160 --> 03:03:25,040
Constipation doesn't let his mom pick him up all the time!

5487
03:03:29,460 --> 03:03:30,000
God!

5488
03:03:35,770 --> 03:03:38,110
Why can't you be cool like his mom?

5489
03:03:41,110 --> 03:03:41,650
God!

5490
03:03:41,650 --> 03:03:42,850
Just leave me alone, Mom!

5491
03:03:43,290 --> 03:03:43,830
God!

5492
03:03:45,530 --> 03:03:47,870
I wish I literally was my mom!

5493
03:03:49,490 --> 03:03:50,850
No, you're getting nuts!

5494
03:03:50,970 --> 03:03:52,550
No, you did not say that, Dragoon!

5495
03:03:52,850 --> 03:03:53,790
You did not!

5496
03:03:53,830 --> 03:03:55,570
You would have been named Constipation!

5497
03:03:55,690 --> 03:03:56,490
Is that what you wanted?

5498
03:03:57,690 --> 03:03:59,150
If she was your mom!

5499
03:03:59,670 --> 03:04:01,350
You want Constipation!

5500
03:04:01,890 --> 03:04:04,470
That would have been your name if it wasn't for me!

5501
03:04:04,790 --> 03:04:05,990
Ha ha ha ha!

5502
03:04:07,310 --> 03:04:08,330
Ha ha ha ha!

5503
03:04:08,930 --> 03:04:09,790
Ha ha ha ha!

5504
03:04:10,790 --> 03:04:12,030
It's not that bad, Mom!

5505
03:04:12,170 --> 03:04:13,750
No one brought us Constipation!

5506
03:04:13,770 --> 03:04:14,030
Yeah!

5507
03:04:14,330 --> 03:04:14,810
God!

5508
03:04:15,010 --> 03:04:15,970
It's not even...

5509
03:04:16,590 --> 03:04:18,630
Mom, it's pronounced...

5510
03:04:20,110 --> 03:04:20,590
Constipation!

5511
03:04:20,910 --> 03:04:22,670
Yes, it's pronounced Constipation!

5512
03:04:23,050 --> 03:04:23,930
It's Latin!

5513
03:04:24,790 --> 03:04:25,990
For peace!

5514
03:04:27,450 --> 03:04:28,030
God!

5515
03:04:28,230 --> 03:04:29,910
You're so insensitive, Mom!

5516
03:04:31,950 --> 03:04:32,870
Mom, please!

5517
03:04:32,950 --> 03:04:33,370
It's 2024!

5518
03:04:34,010 --> 03:04:34,710
Grow up!

5519
03:04:35,350 --> 03:04:37,550
Wait, then Dragoon got lost?

5520
03:04:38,540 --> 03:04:39,210
Wait, what?

5521
03:04:40,110 --> 03:04:43,730
They lost their child for like five seconds!

5522
03:04:44,710 --> 03:04:46,010
Ha ha ha ha!

5523
03:04:47,150 --> 03:04:48,450
Well, I had a break.

5524
03:04:48,510 --> 03:04:48,790
Fuck!

5525
03:04:49,010 --> 03:04:49,450
Wait!

5526
03:04:49,710 --> 03:04:51,050
Get your child!

5527
03:04:51,170 --> 03:04:52,670
How did you lose your kid?

5528
03:04:53,710 --> 03:04:56,050
Ha ha ha ha!

5529
03:04:56,050 --> 03:04:57,310
Oh my God!

5530
03:04:57,590 --> 03:04:59,670
Alright, I'm gonna hold it until like...

5531
03:04:59,670 --> 03:05:00,930
they get better Dragoon.

5532
03:05:01,690 --> 03:05:02,650
Over here.

5533
03:05:02,970 --> 03:05:04,210
Go get your child!

5534
03:05:04,270 --> 03:05:04,810
Come on!

5535
03:05:06,370 --> 03:05:07,430
Mom, no!

5536
03:05:07,490 --> 03:05:08,210
I'm running away!

5537
03:05:09,510 --> 03:05:10,970
I like how someone's like...

5538
03:05:10,970 --> 03:05:12,130
Mom, it's 2024!

5539
03:05:12,970 --> 03:05:15,010
Constipation is a common name!

5540
03:05:15,590 --> 03:05:16,870
Ha ha ha ha!

5541
03:05:17,230 --> 03:05:18,630
Ha ha ha ha!

5542
03:05:18,730 --> 03:05:20,590
Okay, okay...

5543
03:05:20,590 --> 03:05:21,730
Ha ha ha ha!

5544
03:05:23,970 --> 03:05:25,590
Get up the times, Mom!

5545
03:05:25,930 --> 03:05:26,430
Okay, here.

5546
03:05:26,510 --> 03:05:27,750
This is my Moranebu site.

5547
03:05:27,950 --> 03:05:29,650
It means peace in Latin.

5548
03:05:32,050 --> 03:05:33,030
Summertime hard!

5549
03:05:33,050 --> 03:05:33,510
Let's go!

5550
03:05:33,910 --> 03:05:35,590
Ha ha ha ha!

5551
03:05:35,950 --> 03:05:36,310
Yippee!

5552
03:05:37,450 --> 03:05:39,350
You can loaf around.

5553
03:05:40,010 --> 03:05:42,490
I think this is a good time to call it.

5554
03:05:42,850 --> 03:05:46,050
Yeah, I think I've been constipated for long enough.

5555
03:05:46,470 --> 03:05:47,570
Ha ha ha ha!

5556
03:05:47,650 --> 03:05:48,650
That was fun!

5557
03:05:48,990 --> 03:05:50,010
Great time!

5558
03:05:50,450 --> 03:05:51,470
This was so good!

5559
03:05:51,590 --> 03:05:55,150
I'm so glad we all opened to ceremony, but I've still been looking for a den.

5560
03:05:55,270 --> 03:05:57,010
Yeah, we've so been looking for holes!

5561
03:05:57,690 --> 03:06:00,570
We've still been looking and pissing.

5562
03:06:00,670 --> 03:06:03,050
Yeah, we feel like, what are we doing?

5563
03:06:03,970 --> 03:06:05,690
Alright, one last howl, yes!

5564
03:06:05,750 --> 03:06:07,030
As a group, come over here!

5565
03:06:07,310 --> 03:06:07,750
Let's go!

5566
03:06:08,130 --> 03:06:09,510
We howl together!

5567
03:06:10,210 --> 03:06:10,770
Awww!

5568
03:06:11,910 --> 03:06:12,250
Child

5569
03:06:19,280 --> 03:06:21,320
was unmalnourished!

5570
03:06:22,740 --> 03:06:23,300
Malnourished!

5571
03:06:23,680 --> 03:06:24,240
Wooo!

5572
03:06:26,160 --> 03:06:27,140
No food!

5573
03:06:27,140 --> 03:06:28,220
Hahaha!

5574
03:06:29,420 --> 03:06:30,140
Wooo!

5575
03:06:31,780 --> 03:06:32,500
Hahaha!

5576
03:06:33,020 --> 03:06:35,620
Thanks for joining me, literally!

5577
03:06:36,060 --> 03:06:40,080
I'm glad we picked this game!

5578
03:06:40,260 --> 03:06:40,760
Hahaha!

5579
03:06:42,800 --> 03:06:46,120
I'm glad we picked this game to play together.

5580
03:06:46,740 --> 03:06:51,020
And when you suggested this game, I was like, this is the one!

5581
03:06:51,040 --> 03:06:51,620
Yeah, this is it!

5582
03:06:51,640 --> 03:06:54,220
We need this game!

5583
03:06:54,520 --> 03:06:56,340
I need this fucking game!

5584
03:06:57,140 --> 03:06:57,600
Hahaha!

5585
03:06:58,060 --> 03:07:01,800
Thank you to the Shrimp Goons for teaching us how to play!

5586
03:07:02,000 --> 03:07:04,220
We really appreciate it!

5587
03:07:04,380 --> 03:07:06,400
Thank you so much Shrimp Gooning Inc!

5588
03:07:06,880 --> 03:07:10,720
Thank you Shrimp Goons Incorporated for teaching us!

5589
03:07:10,820 --> 03:07:15,080
We were able to get this far because of all you!

5590
03:07:15,800 --> 03:07:16,000
Hahaha!

5591
03:07:16,000 --> 03:07:20,620
Our puppies would have died like four minutes We wouldn't even have puppies!

5592
03:07:20,800 --> 03:07:21,420
Hahaha!

5593
03:07:23,500 --> 03:07:25,040
What a loss!

5594
03:07:25,300 --> 03:07:25,660
Hahaha!

5595
03:07:25,660 --> 03:07:28,000
We've still been so fucking lost!

5596
03:07:28,720 --> 03:07:29,260
Hahaha!

5597
03:07:29,700 --> 03:07:33,940
Look, that is why we are supervisors, not workers!

5598
03:07:34,220 --> 03:07:37,600
We're very good at supervising!

5599
03:07:37,680 --> 03:07:40,020
We're very bad at doing anything else!

5600
03:07:40,020 --> 03:07:40,560
We make good decisions!

5601
03:07:41,040 --> 03:07:43,220
Yes, we are the decision people!

5602
03:07:43,720 --> 03:07:44,220
Hahaha!

5603
03:07:44,640 --> 03:07:45,340
Hahaha!

5604
03:07:46,660 --> 03:07:48,700
This game is so good!

5605
03:07:48,860 --> 03:07:49,260
Hahaha!

5606
03:07:51,400 --> 03:07:53,940
Thank you 500 Hour Andes!

5607
03:07:53,980 --> 03:07:54,840
Thank you!

5608
03:07:54,920 --> 03:07:56,080
For finding us a den!

5609
03:07:57,140 --> 03:07:58,740
And taking care of our children!

5610
03:07:59,060 --> 03:08:00,180
And feeding them!

5611
03:08:00,960 --> 03:08:03,640
And fighting off the predators!

5612
03:08:03,920 --> 03:08:06,040
We really appreciate it!

5613
03:08:06,380 --> 03:08:06,900
Hahaha!

5614
03:08:06,900 --> 03:08:08,880
Thank you Lily for joining me!

5615
03:08:08,900 --> 03:08:10,840
Thank you for having me!

5616
03:08:10,900 --> 03:08:12,000
It was so good!

5617
03:08:12,260 --> 03:08:13,100
It was fun!

5618
03:08:13,260 --> 03:08:14,640
Until next time!

5619
03:08:14,640 --> 03:08:16,580
Until next time!

5620
03:08:16,620 --> 03:08:19,700
Until next wolf quest anniversary edition!

5621
03:08:20,120 --> 03:08:20,440
Hahaha!

5622
03:08:21,800 --> 03:08:23,740
Thank you Shrimps!

5623
03:08:23,740 --> 03:08:24,780
I hope you had fun!

5624
03:08:25,600 --> 03:08:26,700
All it dragons!

5625
03:08:28,300 --> 03:08:29,460
Goodbye dragons!

5626
03:08:30,200 --> 03:08:31,080
Bye dookie!

5627
03:08:31,080 --> 03:08:32,360
I'm going to talk to my channel!

5628
03:08:33,300 --> 03:08:34,060
Bye bye!

5629
03:08:34,120 --> 03:08:34,480
Bye bye!

5630
03:08:36,760 --> 03:08:37,340
Hahaha!

5631
03:08:39,400 --> 03:08:40,960
I'm going to close the server!

5632
03:08:41,260 --> 03:08:41,740
Hahaha!

5633
03:08:43,470 --> 03:08:43,760
Goodbye!

5634
03:08:44,240 --> 03:08:47,420
You will never reunite with your children ever again!

5635
03:08:47,420 --> 03:08:47,440
Oh shit!

5636
03:08:47,500 --> 03:08:48,680
I almost forgot to save!

5637
03:08:48,780 --> 03:08:49,200
Hahaha!

5638
03:08:49,200 --> 03:08:49,520
Hahaha!

5639
03:08:49,620 --> 03:08:50,240
Hahaha!

5640
03:08:51,060 --> 03:08:51,700
Oh!

5641
03:08:51,760 --> 03:08:53,260
Hard work gone!

5642
03:08:53,540 --> 03:08:55,180
No way!

5643
03:08:55,500 --> 03:08:56,400
Okay I saved!

5644
03:08:56,500 --> 03:08:57,140
Okay!

5645
03:08:59,200 --> 03:09:01,620
Alright I'll see you later Lily!

5646
03:09:01,760 --> 03:09:02,440
I'll see you!

5647
03:09:02,740 --> 03:09:03,360
Bye bye!

5648
03:09:03,540 --> 03:09:03,960
Bye bye!

5649
03:09:05,380 --> 03:09:07,540
Oh my god that was so fun!

5650
03:09:07,980 --> 03:09:10,840
We just had a fun time!

5651
03:09:11,080 --> 03:09:13,140
With Lily and I!

5652
03:09:13,360 --> 03:09:14,700
We went in blind!

5653
03:09:14,920 --> 03:09:16,220
We were so confused!

5654
03:09:16,220 --> 03:09:22,240
So I'm glad we ended up opening the server to the people who actually have experience with this game!

5655
03:09:22,460 --> 03:09:26,720
To teach us how to raise the children!

5656
03:09:27,340 --> 03:09:30,140
I hope you guys had a really fun time watching!

5657
03:09:30,360 --> 03:09:33,480
It was a really fun time collabing with Lily!

5658
03:09:33,840 --> 03:09:35,300
Let me swap real fast!

5659
03:09:35,780 --> 03:09:36,820
Boop boop boop boop boop!

5660
03:09:37,320 --> 03:09:39,620
Oh my god!

5661
03:09:39,660 --> 03:09:45,260
I think like the exciting thing about it is just like meeting lots of new people!

5662
03:09:45,260 --> 03:09:48,720
And like collabing with so many new people!

5663
03:09:49,460 --> 03:09:50,340
But yeah!

5664
03:09:50,600 --> 03:09:54,500
I had an amazing time with Lily today!

5665
03:09:54,860 --> 03:09:57,240
And just messing about!

5666
03:09:58,080 --> 03:09:58,280
Hahaha!

5667
03:09:59,620 --> 03:10:00,840
Oh my god!

5668
03:10:00,960 --> 03:10:01,240
Oh!

5669
03:10:01,740 --> 03:10:03,080
If you're not...

5670
03:10:03,080 --> 03:10:04,240
For those who aren't...

5671
03:10:05,180 --> 03:10:08,960
For those who didn't see the new community post for members!

5672
03:10:09,320 --> 03:10:10,420
For the member goon!

5673
03:10:10,960 --> 03:10:14,280
I'm currently working with a Minecraft team right now!

5674
03:10:14,340 --> 03:10:15,240
On making a new community post!

5675
03:10:15,240 --> 03:10:16,100
A community server!

5676
03:10:17,120 --> 03:10:19,680
A Dragoon community Minecraft server!

5677
03:10:20,200 --> 03:10:20,640
So...

5678
03:10:21,200 --> 03:10:22,580
I'm really happy because like...

5679
03:10:22,580 --> 03:10:24,580
Gumi was the one that hit me up with...

5680
03:10:24,580 --> 03:10:25,460
Not hit me up!

5681
03:10:25,480 --> 03:10:25,560
Sorry!

5682
03:10:25,600 --> 03:10:27,320
I asked Gumi because she's really...

5683
03:10:27,320 --> 03:10:30,840
She's in like all these like SMPs and stuff!

5684
03:10:30,900 --> 03:10:32,340
Like Minecraft SMPs!

5685
03:10:32,440 --> 03:10:34,220
Like the... which one was it?

5686
03:10:34,240 --> 03:10:35,620
The really big one?

5687
03:10:35,980 --> 03:10:37,960
Which one was it that has like Spanish integration?

5688
03:10:38,580 --> 03:10:40,180
She's in like those SMPs!

5689
03:10:40,180 --> 03:10:41,900
And she actually was in a Dream SMP as well!

5690
03:10:41,980 --> 03:10:44,980
And she did like the MCC as well!

5691
03:10:45,240 --> 03:10:46,140
And has won the MCC!

5692
03:10:46,220 --> 03:10:48,440
So she has like so many connections with...

5693
03:10:49,140 --> 03:10:50,800
With like the...

5694
03:10:51,660 --> 03:10:52,260

5695
03:10:53,040 --> 03:10:53,660
Minecraft people!

5696
03:10:53,940 --> 03:10:54,480
And she...

5697
03:10:54,480 --> 03:10:55,200
Yeah the QSMP!

5698
03:10:55,340 --> 03:10:56,940
Gumi is actually in the QSMP!

5699
03:10:57,200 --> 03:10:58,800
So I asked her for like...

5700
03:10:58,800 --> 03:11:01,300
If she knows somebody who can make the...

5701
03:11:01,300 --> 03:11:03,140
Dragoon members...

5702
03:11:03,140 --> 03:11:04,360

5703
03:11:04,520 --> 03:11:06,840
So she connected me with...

5704
03:11:07,760 --> 03:11:09,180
With this team!

5705
03:11:09,640 --> 03:11:10,240
That...

5706
03:11:10,240 --> 03:11:12,980
With this team that has done like...

5707
03:11:12,980 --> 03:11:13,700

5708
03:11:15,240 --> 03:11:17,140
And Minecraft maps for like...

5709
03:11:17,140 --> 03:11:19,280
A lot of like Minecraft content creators!

5710
03:11:19,440 --> 03:11:20,900
As well as...

5711
03:11:20,900 --> 03:11:23,200
Like a lot of like SMPs and stuff...

5712
03:11:23,200 --> 03:11:24,060
For content creators!

5713
03:11:24,160 --> 03:11:25,160
For Minecraft people!

5714
03:11:25,380 --> 03:11:27,340
As well as they were the ones that made...

5715
03:11:27,340 --> 03:11:28,460
The Twitch Rivals!

5716
03:11:28,820 --> 03:11:30,780

5717
03:11:31,120 --> 03:11:32,340
For Twitch Rivals!

5718
03:11:32,520 --> 03:11:34,820
So like she connected me up with them!

5719
03:11:35,020 --> 03:11:37,020
And they are currently working on the...

5720
03:11:37,020 --> 03:11:39,060
Server at the moment for member goons!

5721
03:11:39,320 --> 03:11:41,200
This Minecraft server will only be...

5722
03:11:41,200 --> 03:11:43,160
For the current Dragoon members!

5723
03:11:43,160 --> 03:11:44,860
So it will be like synced up to the members list!

5724
03:11:45,760 --> 03:11:46,560
Um... but...

5725
03:11:46,560 --> 03:11:49,040
And like I made a post asking...

5726
03:11:49,040 --> 03:11:49,640
For...

5727
03:11:50,220 --> 03:11:53,020
For like what your input is and what you are looking for...

5728
03:11:53,020 --> 03:11:55,220
In the server so if there is any plugins you want...

5729
03:11:55,220 --> 03:11:57,200
Like what the lobby map will look like...

5730
03:11:57,200 --> 03:11:59,220
So like we are hoping to have like a place...

5731
03:11:59,220 --> 03:12:01,220
Where when you log in you will be dropped into the...

5732
03:12:01,220 --> 03:12:01,720
Lobby area!

5733
03:12:01,980 --> 03:12:05,000
So we need to give them like features...

5734
03:12:05,000 --> 03:12:05,600
Of what they want!

5735
03:12:05,740 --> 03:12:07,340

5746
03:12:25,900 --> 03:12:27,120
Little man?

5747
03:12:27,420 --> 03:12:27,980
Yes...

5748
03:12:28,900 --> 03:12:29,980
Little man...

5749
03:12:29,980 --> 03:12:33,320
Um... they have been helping me a lot with setting all the auction stuff...

5750
03:12:33,320 --> 03:12:34,840
They have actually helped me with like...

5751
03:12:34,840 --> 03:12:36,940
Getting in touch with like Tiltify...

5752
03:12:36,940 --> 03:12:39,160
And like the brain and behavior foundation...

5753
03:12:39,680 --> 03:12:40,880
Research foundation...

5754
03:12:40,880 --> 03:12:42,720
Um... they have been working really hard...

5755
03:12:43,160 --> 03:12:44,460
Setting everything up for us...

5756
03:12:44,460 --> 03:12:46,540
And listing up all the auction items...

5757
03:12:46,540 --> 03:12:48,960
I am super duper excited...

5758
03:12:48,960 --> 03:12:51,320
I will give you guys... those who are in the member stream...

5759
03:12:51,320 --> 03:12:53,180
I can give you guys a sneak peek...

5760
03:12:53,180 --> 03:12:55,320
Of like some of the items...

5761
03:12:55,320 --> 03:12:57,480
Uh... let me see if I can find...

5762
03:12:57,480 --> 03:12:59,180
Um... I will give you a sneak peek...

5763
03:12:59,180 --> 03:13:01,160
Of some of the items... so for example...

5764
03:13:01,160 --> 03:13:01,680
This!

5765
03:13:02,120 --> 03:13:04,700
Will be in the auction...

5766
03:13:04,700 --> 03:13:06,320
One of them because the other one is for me...

5767
03:13:07,500 --> 03:13:09,880
But here are some of the items...

5768
03:13:09,880 --> 03:13:11,380
That will be in...

5769
03:13:11,380 --> 03:13:12,780
The auction...

5770
03:13:13,160 --> 03:13:15,140
So like a... two of a kind...

5771
03:13:15,140 --> 03:13:16,120
The other one is for me...

5772
03:13:16,120 --> 03:13:17,820
So technically two of a kind...

5773
03:13:19,240 --> 03:13:20,840
Um... Doki plush...

5774
03:13:20,840 --> 03:13:22,580
Um... and...

5775
03:13:22,990 --> 03:13:25,400
They are currently setting it up at the moment...

5776
03:13:25,400 --> 03:13:27,300
So like some stuff to look forward to...

5777
03:13:27,300 --> 03:13:28,440
The stream itself...

5778
03:13:28,440 --> 03:13:30,260
It's going to be very random...

5779
03:13:30,260 --> 03:13:33,420
There will be like some stretch goals and everything...

5780
03:13:33,420 --> 03:13:35,280
Um... and...

5781
03:13:35,780 --> 03:13:37,260
Um... I am still trying to figure out...

5782
03:13:37,260 --> 03:13:38,360
What to do on the stream...

5783
03:13:38,360 --> 03:13:40,600
But the auction might start...

5784
03:13:41,520 --> 03:13:42,960
Tonight... or... before...

5785
03:13:43,160 --> 03:13:43,960
The stream starts...

5786
03:13:43,960 --> 03:13:47,180
And... um... LittleMad told me to let you guys know...

5787
03:13:47,180 --> 03:13:49,500
That if you are looking to bid on the item...

5788
03:13:49,500 --> 03:13:50,820
You need to have a...

5789
03:13:50,820 --> 03:13:51,900
Tiltify account...

5790
03:13:51,900 --> 03:13:53,800
And you have to link your...

5791
03:13:53,800 --> 03:13:55,620
Link a payment...

5792
03:13:55,620 --> 03:13:59,220
Method and your address on your account...

5793
03:13:59,220 --> 03:14:01,370
Your account has to be registered on Tiltify...

5794
03:14:01,780 --> 03:14:02,820
And also...

5795
03:14:02,820 --> 03:14:04,860
Have a...

5796
03:14:04,860 --> 03:14:05,980
And also...

5797
03:14:05,980 --> 03:14:07,840
Have payment method linked...

5798
03:14:07,840 --> 03:14:09,920
As well as your address registered...

5799
03:14:09,920 --> 03:14:12,220
So you'll be able to... um...

5800
03:14:13,400 --> 03:14:14,880
Bid on the items...

5801
03:14:14,880 --> 03:14:16,240
Uh... so like...

5802
03:14:16,240 --> 03:14:18,860
I just need you guys to remind you guys about it...

5803
03:14:18,860 --> 03:14:20,000
How long will the charity stream be?

5804
03:14:20,140 --> 03:14:23,420
Um... I will try my best to stream as long as I can...

5805
03:14:23,420 --> 03:14:25,400
I won't... I don't want to force myself too hard...

5806
03:14:25,400 --> 03:14:26,460
To stream a very long time...

5807
03:14:26,460 --> 03:14:28,320
But the auction itself...

5808
03:14:28,320 --> 03:14:30,740
Would be around... would be...

5809
03:14:30,740 --> 03:14:32,940
Uh... will last all the way...

5810
03:14:32,940 --> 03:14:34,520
For 24 hours...

5811
03:14:34,520 --> 03:14:36,280
That is my hope...

5812
03:14:36,280 --> 03:14:38,120
Um... so if we do...

5813
03:14:38,120 --> 03:14:41,860
Or 2 days... I want the auction to be around 2 days...

5814
03:14:41,860 --> 03:14:43,140
Uh... so people have...

5815
03:14:43,160 --> 03:14:45,040
As much time to bid it and everything...

5816
03:14:45,040 --> 03:14:48,000
So I'm gonna try and have the auction itself...

5817
03:14:48,000 --> 03:14:49,380
Be 2 days...

5818
03:14:49,380 --> 03:14:51,380
Um... there is around 30 items...

5819
03:14:51,940 --> 03:14:53,100
In the auction...

5820
03:14:53,100 --> 03:14:55,480
And I'm super duper excited...

5821
03:14:55,480 --> 03:14:57,120
Uh... I'm super duper excited...

5822
03:14:57,120 --> 03:14:58,380
For the auction and hope that...

5823
03:14:58,380 --> 03:15:01,360
Um... a lot of you guys enjoy some of the items...

5824
03:15:01,360 --> 03:15:02,220
That's on there...

5825
03:15:02,820 --> 03:15:04,140
Um... but yeah!

5826
03:15:04,340 --> 03:15:07,220
I hope you guys had a great time...

5827
03:15:07,220 --> 03:15:08,220
Um...

5828
03:15:08,220 --> 03:15:10,720
With the collab with Lily...

5829
03:15:10,720 --> 03:15:13,140
And uh... enjoyed just like...

5830
03:15:13,160 --> 03:15:14,840
Um... me meeting...

5831
03:15:14,840 --> 03:15:16,320
Lots of new people...

5832
03:15:16,320 --> 03:15:18,540
Um... next week I will be...

5833
03:15:18,540 --> 03:15:21,340
I know I have one collab that's finalized...

5834
03:15:21,340 --> 03:15:23,340
Well... we haven't decided the game yet...

5835
03:15:23,340 --> 03:15:24,720
We haven't decided the game yet...

5836
03:15:24,720 --> 03:15:26,820
But... um... I reached out to...

5837
03:15:26,820 --> 03:15:29,400
ChibiDoki if they wanted to collab with me...

5838
03:15:29,400 --> 03:15:30,380
Cause I thought it would be funny...

5839
03:15:30,380 --> 03:15:31,540
Cause we're both Dokis...

5840
03:15:31,540 --> 03:15:34,400
Uh... so next week... I'm still deciding the game...

5841
03:15:34,400 --> 03:15:35,980
So I'll be collabing with...

5842
03:15:35,980 --> 03:15:38,740
Uh... collabing with ChibiDoki next week...

5843
03:15:38,740 --> 03:15:40,340
Um... other than that...

5844
03:15:40,340 --> 03:15:42,760
Uh... there is so much work...

5845
03:15:43,160 --> 03:15:44,580
So... so much work...

5846
03:15:44,580 --> 03:15:45,760
I'm always so busy...

5847
03:15:45,760 --> 03:15:48,440
Yesterday I spent all my day just working...

5848
03:15:50,220 --> 03:15:51,420
I'm always super nervous...

5849
03:15:51,800 --> 03:15:53,000
Uh... regarding collab...

5850
03:15:53,000 --> 03:15:55,740
I know like... I always reach out to people for collab...

5851
03:15:55,740 --> 03:15:56,420
But also...

5852
03:15:56,420 --> 03:15:58,620
I'm always super nervous when collabing...

5853
03:15:59,160 --> 03:16:00,360
Because... um... I...

5854
03:16:00,360 --> 03:16:03,000
You know... when it's like new people...

5855
03:16:03,000 --> 03:16:04,780
I don't know what the chemistry is like...

5856
03:16:04,780 --> 03:16:07,240
So like... um... I try to pick games out...

5857
03:16:07,240 --> 03:16:08,780
That I feel would work the best...

5858
03:16:08,780 --> 03:16:10,720
Between us and everything...

5859
03:16:10,720 --> 03:16:12,360
And... uh...

5860
03:16:12,360 --> 03:16:13,520
Um... so...

5861
03:16:13,520 --> 03:16:16,800
It's always so nerve-wracking before a collab...

5862
03:16:16,800 --> 03:16:18,620
Because I don't know what the chemistry is gonna be like...

5863
03:16:18,620 --> 03:16:21,180
And everything... as like a one-to-one thing...

5864
03:16:21,180 --> 03:16:22,580
And... um...

5865
03:16:22,580 --> 03:16:24,280
And I'm just happy that...

5866
03:16:24,280 --> 03:16:25,900
Lily enjoyed herself...

5867
03:16:26,480 --> 03:16:28,040
And... uh... we all had a great time!

5868
03:16:28,400 --> 03:16:28,820
Also!

5869
03:16:29,060 --> 03:16:30,440
So my mod reminded me...

5870
03:16:30,440 --> 03:16:30,860
New merch!

5871
03:16:31,160 --> 03:16:31,720
Yes!

5872
03:16:31,980 --> 03:16:33,240
New merch!

5873
03:16:33,780 --> 03:16:34,280
The...

5874
03:16:34,280 --> 03:16:36,560
Lunar... Yeah sorry... the Lunar New Year is over...

5875
03:16:36,560 --> 03:16:39,660
I know the Lunar New Year is over...

5876
03:16:39,660 --> 03:16:40,400
But...

5877
03:16:41,920 --> 03:16:44,060
We have Lunar New Year merch!

5878
03:16:44,440 --> 03:16:45,500
We have Lunar New Year merch!

5879
03:16:45,500 --> 03:16:45,960
Look!

5880
03:16:46,060 --> 03:16:47,480
I'm still getting ahead of...

5881
03:16:47,480 --> 03:16:47,780
Look!

5882
03:16:47,780 --> 03:16:47,780
I'm still getting ahead of...

5883
03:16:47,780 --> 03:16:49,520
Planning merch in advance, okay?

5884
03:16:49,860 --> 03:16:52,020
It's very difficult...

5885
03:16:52,960 --> 03:16:55,640
So... the Lunar New Year merch...

5886
03:16:55,640 --> 03:16:55,720
So... the Lunar New Year merch...

5887
03:16:55,720 --> 03:16:57,880
Will be on sale...

5888
03:16:58,480 --> 03:17:00,600
On... March 3rd...

5889
03:17:00,600 --> 03:17:02,140
At 5pm PST...

5890
03:17:02,140 --> 03:17:05,200
There will be 200 limited edition bundles...

5891
03:17:05,200 --> 03:17:07,040
That come with a signed postcard...

5892
03:17:07,040 --> 03:17:10,020
And... only the red pocket envelopes...

5893
03:17:10,720 --> 03:17:11,720
The pre-order for all of this...

5894
03:17:11,720 --> 03:17:13,760
Will be up for a month...

5895
03:17:13,760 --> 03:17:16,920
And then everything but the red pocket envelopes...

5896
03:17:16,920 --> 03:17:18,180
Will be off the store...

5897
03:17:18,180 --> 03:17:19,920
So... red pocket envelopes...

5898
03:17:19,920 --> 03:17:22,320
Will be in the store forever...

5899
03:17:22,320 --> 03:17:24,960
But everything else will be off the store...

5900
03:17:24,960 --> 03:17:25,880
Because it's limited...

5901
03:17:25,880 --> 03:17:27,700
It's only there for pre-order...

5902
03:17:27,700 --> 03:17:28,680
So yeah!

5903
03:17:28,880 --> 03:17:30,660
So there's a pillow, acrylic stand...

5904
03:17:30,660 --> 03:17:32,560
Button, sticker, and red pocket envelopes...

5905
03:17:32,560 --> 03:17:35,220
Snapshots will be in the bundle only...

5906
03:17:35,220 --> 03:17:36,440
That's not limited...

5907
03:17:36,440 --> 03:17:39,040
But the limited ones will be the signed postcards...

5908
03:17:39,040 --> 03:17:40,620
So that is...

5909
03:17:40,620 --> 03:17:42,460
The Lunar New Year Merch!

5910
03:17:42,460 --> 03:17:44,140
I think those are all the updates...

5911
03:17:44,700 --> 03:17:46,800
Yes, I know I might be late...

5912
03:17:46,800 --> 03:17:48,260
Ivy, thank you for the super chat!

5913
03:17:49,240 --> 03:17:50,800
Lunar New Year may be over...

5914
03:17:50,800 --> 03:17:52,700
But Year of the Dragon is still for 10 more months...

5915
03:17:52,700 --> 03:17:53,240
Exactly!

5916
03:17:53,500 --> 03:17:54,580
We think like that, Ivy!

5917
03:17:54,760 --> 03:17:55,660
Thank you for the super chat!

5918
03:17:57,900 --> 03:18:00,680
No, the red pocket will be on the store forever...

5919
03:18:00,680 --> 03:18:02,800
Everything else will be gone...

5920
03:18:03,680 --> 03:18:06,320
After the pre-order is done...

5921
03:18:06,320 --> 03:18:07,020
But yeah!

5922
03:18:07,360 --> 03:18:08,860
I hope you guys had a great time!

5923
03:18:08,920 --> 03:18:09,020
Bye!

5924
03:18:09,040 --> 03:18:11,020
I have to work now...

5925
03:18:11,020 --> 03:18:11,880
After the stream...

5926
03:18:11,880 --> 03:18:15,380
I have to do the charity event work stuff...

5927
03:18:15,380 --> 03:18:17,040
But anyway, as always everybody...

5928
03:18:17,040 --> 03:18:18,680
Stay hydrated, posture check...

5929
03:18:18,680 --> 03:18:20,660
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing...

5930
03:18:20,660 --> 03:18:22,000
And if you suffer me...

5931
03:18:22,000 --> 03:18:22,700
Head to bed!

5932
03:18:22,880 --> 03:18:24,080
Cause you deserve it!

5933
03:18:24,200 --> 03:18:25,240
I'll see you guys next time everybody!

5934
03:18:25,580 --> 03:18:26,220
Bye guys!

5935
03:18:26,720 --> 03:18:27,120
Bye!
