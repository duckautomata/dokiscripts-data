162
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:49,130
You're telling me snagged teeth weren't part of it.

Oh, I'm big.

198
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,260

I'll have the stamina and the strength.

207
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,680
I'll do a minus one on the speed.

208
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,300
I have so much speed, but I will just be wheezing after five
steps.

209
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:12,200
Like, oh, my name is Doki Wolf.

210
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:13,320
I...

211
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,700
There's a bio, by the way.

212
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:16,420
I...

213
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:16,760
Oh, my God.

214
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:18,140
I was born...

215
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:18,460
The bio.

216
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,980
Without a father.

217
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:23,180
Without a father.

218
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,600
My mother left me and abandoned me.

219
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:27,440
Oh, yeah.

220
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:31,000
My mother, thank you, thank you for ghostwriting this for
me.

221
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:35,660
My mother abandoned me as a young pup.

222
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:38,720
Casted out by my own family.

223
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:45,260
She now roams the wilds by herself.

224
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:49,420
Let me Google the plot of Naruto real quick.

225
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:57,640
Then I kissed Sasuke.

226
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:01,900
All right, here you go.

227
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:02,940
All right.

228
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:04,260
This is good.

229
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:04,820
This is good.

230
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:05,480
This is it.

231
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:08,180
I figured out a really good plot, guys.

232
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,340
Can I put the B movie script in there?

233
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,460
Yeah, you can't.

234
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,340
All right.

235
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:15,020
All right.

236
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:18,260
In response to the leader of, okay, let's see.

237
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,500
Um, okay.

238
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:22,740
Not Naruto, but Doki Wolf.

239
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:23,980
Doki Wolf.

240
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,320
Unable to make friends.

241
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,320
Unable to make friends.

242
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:36,020
She is always sad and lonely.

243
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:38,300
What is this like?

244
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:40,720
You know like Mary Sue before Wolves?

245
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:44,360
This is like a fucking Davian art.

246
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:45,040
Yeah, yeah.

247
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:49,120
This is like a sparkle wolf for me.

248
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,420
Herself, a male wolf.

249
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:54,780
I mean, hello?

250
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:55,800
It's 2024.

251
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:59,600
Don't judge my male wolf having a female pronoun.

252
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:00,500
What the fuck?

253
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:01,520
Whoa.

254
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:04,080
Don't go there.

255
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:05,820
Hey, dude.

256
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:07,220
This is my original OC.

257
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,100
Do not steal.

258
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,000
This is my original OC.

259
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,300
This is my original OC.

260
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:12,340
All right.

261
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:13,060
Oh, my God.

262
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:13,340
W.

263
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,140
I found you a genius.

264
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:15,980
Just a glimpse.

265
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:17,200
How do I spell a glimpse?

266
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:21,060
Into my dark wolf soul.

267
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:24,600
Inside you there are two wolves.

268
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:26,300
Wait, what did you name your wolf?

269
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,300
What did you name it?

270
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,820
Wait, what do I name him?

271
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:29,480
Right.

272
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:32,620
My wolf is Doki Wolf FPS B2B.

273
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,360
Sad hand job.

274
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:33,660
Oh.

275
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:34,240
The sad.

276
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:35,000
What?

277
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,280
Inside you, there are two wolves.

278
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:41,320
Sad hand job and Doki Wolf.

279
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,500
Wait, wait, wait.

280
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:46,340
I've been picking proper names.

281
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:48,120
Um.

282
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,200
Um.

283
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:52,940
I'm not good with proper names.

284
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,600
How do I pick a proper name?

285
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:55,740
Sad.

286
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:56,680
Oh my god, yes.

287
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:57,080
Sad.

288
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:58,340
Sad.

289
00:22:58,340 --> 00:22:58,620
Sad.

290
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:00,600
That's good.

291
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:02,820
That's good.

292
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:03,940
Yeah.

293
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,740
Okay, maybe I should call Doki Wolf Toe.

294
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:10,520
How do I spell Doki Wolf?

295
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:12,320
Doki Wolf Toe.

296
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:13,580
Do you remember the toe?

297
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,360
Like, not Rudo, but...

298
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:15,840
Oh!

299
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:23,660
Sasuke and the Doki Wolf Toe.

300
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:25,220
Okay.

301
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:27,280
I'll be like...

302
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:27,580
All right.

303
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:27,880
No.

304
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:28,500
Okay.

305
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:33,080
Wolf toe is social bold and energetic.

306
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:35,220
What's Iron Wolf?

307
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:36,440
Lives on the edge.

308
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:37,560
Always one false move.

309
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:42,980
Oh my god, is that like the runescape thing where they make
like what was it like the...

310
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:42,980
Oh!

311
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:43,760
Yeah!

312
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:45,300
Probably, yeah.

313
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,360
Yeah, but this time there's a wolf version.

314
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:50,800
There's a wolf version to this.

315
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:51,880
Oh my god.

316
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:53,420
Yeah, it's like Iron Man mode.

317
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,640
Yeah, but for once.

318
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:55,620
This is crazy.

319
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,540
This is so elaborate.

320
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:58,100
Yeah.

321
00:23:58,220 --> 00:23:59,320
Okay, continue.

322
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:05,040
She's obviously cautious, a loner, but so much energy.

323
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:05,680
Yes, we have.

324
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:06,920
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

325
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:07,240
All right.

326
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:13,000
Should we do story mode, which is we have to raise pups,
territory quest, or pack life?

327
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:15,500
I don't know which one's good.

328
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:18,080
The pack would be cool.

329
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:22,260
Like, what if we just do something wrong and then I just got
killed?

330
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:26,260
I'm pretty sure it's the same, right?

331
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,460
The story mode, it's like establish a territory or
inventory.

There's an accurate level.

341
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:28,700
Accurate?

342
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:29,720

00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:30,640
No, it's fine.

344
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:33,760
We don't need to have it be accurate.

345
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,520
I'm fine with that.

346
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,540
Major decisions.

347
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:37,200

00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:38,960

352
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,160

353
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:48,380
Sage is gonna come in.

354
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,820

the next generation which will carry their genes in the

357
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:17,300
future all else from hunting elk to defending a territory
drives towards the single goal now your pack which consists

358
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:23,380
of two parents and perhaps several pack as adults, can try
to realize this goal.

359
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:29,080
The survival of the new literal pups and the survival of
your genetic code will be your responsibility.

360
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,280

Yeah, why sniff butt?

530
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,460
This game is not accurate.

531
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:40,120
Maybe it's a DLC.

532
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:44,860
But sniffing DLC.

533
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:48,820
All right.

00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:49,700

00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:50,960
What even is our purpose?

536
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:55,220
We were supposed to establish territory and, like, raise
our...

raise pups.

538
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,800
Our purpose is revenge.

539
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:00,740
Revenge.

540
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:02,000
We need to find her Sakura.

541
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:03,460
I also failed us.

542
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:07,440

543
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,960
We need to find her Sakura.

544
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:12,580

550
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:28,560

654
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:00,440

Food will cure your broken leg.

801
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:12,600

It's like all the snow.

Like, it cannot be all the nature.

827
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:15,320

There has to be a cave.

829
00:48:18,380 --> 00:48:19,600
That's what nature's for.

830
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:20,940

It's just snow and trees.

and trees?

879
00:52:35,460 --> 00:52:36,000
This is how it works.

880
00:52:36,140 --> 00:52:37,340
Do I pee on the smell now?

881
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:38,200
Yes!

882
00:52:38,620 --> 00:52:40,260
I figured out the game!

883
00:52:40,380 --> 00:52:41,240
You figured it out!

884
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:41,800
How?

885
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:47,220
So, that was this icon on the map and I just peed on the
icon.

886
00:52:47,420 --> 00:52:48,520
And now...

887
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:51,820
I just peed on it.

888
00:52:52,060 --> 00:52:53,060
And now it's mine.

889
00:52:55,340 --> 00:52:57,100
It's just that easy, guys.

890
00:52:57,600 --> 00:52:58,800
It's just...

891
00:52:58,800 --> 00:52:59,920
Just pee on it.

892
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:01,180
There's a coyote.

893
00:53:02,940 --> 00:53:04,320
Yeah, I've marked it as mine.

894
00:53:04,420 --> 00:53:07,300
Now I have to wait again to reinforce my mark.

895
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:08,160
Okay, okay, okay.

896
00:53:08,300 --> 00:53:08,740
Let me...

897
00:53:08,740 --> 00:53:09,700
Okay, I'll come to you.

898
00:53:09,940 --> 00:53:11,100
All right, I'm gonna pee as well.

899
00:53:11,740 --> 00:53:12,420
Just in case.

900
00:53:13,820 --> 00:53:14,720
Just to make sure.

901
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:16,300
Yeah, I'm just in case.

902
00:53:17,620 --> 00:53:19,500
I just need to make sure.

903
00:53:19,580 --> 00:53:21,380
I just need to make sure I have this post.

904
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:24,580
You know, it's like double tap, but for pee.

905
00:53:24,860 --> 00:53:25,380
Double tap.

906
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:28,900
But double pee, just like, two beams.

907
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:29,860
Yeah, yeah.

908
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:32,240
I hear wolves.

909
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:32,800
You?

910
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:33,640
Are you howling?

911
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:34,040
No.

912
00:53:34,700 --> 00:53:35,280
That's done our woes.

913
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:36,900
I hear howls.

914
00:53:37,060 --> 00:53:37,840
That's not our woes.

915
00:53:39,580 --> 00:53:40,120
That's not...

916
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:42,020
We can convert woes into our pack, though.

917
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:44,840
Yeah, yeah, I'll howl back.

918
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:45,600
Where are they?

919
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:45,980
Where are they?

920
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:46,760
Friendly.

921
00:53:47,100 --> 00:53:47,520
Wait, wait, wait.

922
00:53:47,540 --> 00:53:48,120
I don't...

923
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:48,880
Force them to join our pack.

924
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:52,680
If you look at the map, I'm quite a bit away from you.

925
00:53:52,940 --> 00:53:54,120
Because I followed the...

926
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:54,620
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

927
00:53:54,700 --> 00:53:55,340
I'm just gonna...

928
00:53:55,340 --> 00:53:56,260
I'm gonna keep peeing.

929
00:53:57,120 --> 00:53:57,900
I'm gonna...

930
00:53:57,900 --> 00:53:59,320
I'm gonna keep peeing.

931
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:00,700
We need more...

932
00:54:00,700 --> 00:54:01,700
We need more territory.

933
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:02,560
I'm just gonna...

934
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:04,580
I'm just going to keep peeing on stuff.

935
00:54:06,220 --> 00:54:07,280
Just keep peeing.

936
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:08,660
Oh, above 50%.

937
00:54:09,420 --> 00:54:14,620
It's most efficient to let hex drop to 30 since you can
boost him to 100% one action.

938
00:54:15,100 --> 00:54:18,320
On your marking trip, visit as many hexes in a short trip as
possible.

939
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:19,940
When can we have a home?

940
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:22,840
I just want to have a home and make puppies.

941
00:54:23,140 --> 00:54:23,940
Like, that's...

942
00:54:23,940 --> 00:54:26,220
I thought I thought I thought I'd breed.

943
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:31,960

We need more wolves.

953
00:55:36,660 --> 00:55:37,600
We need more wolves.

954
00:55:37,860 --> 00:55:39,320
Where does the other wolves go?

955
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:40,920
Where are these other wolves?

956
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:42,700
We want to steal your children.

957
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:45,160
I don't want to steal.

958
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:48,000
Please give up your first boy for me.

959
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:49,220
For us.

960
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:53,020
How are we going to start a pack if we can't steal your
kids?

961
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:56,960

Pee on it.

965
00:56:00,540 --> 00:56:01,700
Pee, me too.

966
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:02,580
Let me pee just in case.

967
00:56:03,420 --> 00:56:05,860
Just in case.

968
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:07,080
Just in case.

969
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:07,360
Just in case.

970
00:56:07,700 --> 00:56:07,960
Alright.

We got it.

973
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:11,280
Okay, we have to find a den.

974
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:14,400
If we find a den, maybe there will be already kids inside.

975
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:17,240
Like a Christmas present?

976
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:18,720
Santa just brought us kids?

977
00:56:18,860 --> 00:56:19,440
Yeah, yeah.

978
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:20,940
We're Santa.

979
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:26,620
We're Santa taking away the kids.

980
00:56:27,640 --> 00:56:29,000
Remember, don't be naughty.

981
00:56:29,180 --> 00:56:31,900
Or Santa's gonna come over and take your children.

982
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:34,900
Santa, why is your sack empty?

983
00:56:35,020 --> 00:56:35,940
Don't worry, young boy.

984
00:56:36,060 --> 00:56:37,540
It will not be empty for very long.

985
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:38,720
He'll be full suit.

986
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:40,080
Just hop on in.

987
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:44,680
Don't worry, just hop on in.

988
00:56:45,080 --> 00:56:45,820
Yeah, yeah.

989
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:46,940
Don't think about it.

990
00:56:47,060 --> 00:56:48,880
Okay, maybe we go the right set.

991
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:50,460
Oh, okay, we gotta...

992
00:56:50,460 --> 00:56:52,120
Why is it always snowing here?

993
00:56:52,340 --> 00:56:52,560
I'm...

994
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:54,820
Right, where the heck is a den?

995
00:56:55,240 --> 00:56:55,680
How do I...

996
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:57,160
Why can I live out of den, man?

997
00:56:57,160 --> 00:56:59,140
All these wolves, they're hibernating.

998
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:01,060
What the fuck are we supposed to do?

999
00:57:01,820 --> 00:57:02,220
Right?

1000
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:06,060
What do I go to find?

1001
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:07,740
Okay, maybe I zoom in.

1002
00:57:08,780 --> 00:57:10,020
Okay, I'm gonna...

1003
00:57:10,020 --> 00:57:11,300
I'm gonna head straight.

1004
00:57:11,860 --> 00:57:13,760
There must be a cave right there.

1005
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:15,760
I'm gonna head straight down.

1006
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:17,660
I'm not hungry anyway.

1007
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:19,960
I'm gonna head straight down.

1008
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:21,600
I will find...

1009
00:57:22,180 --> 00:57:23,540
I will find a hole.

1010
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:29,500
I'm like, oh, you say straight down, but your walking line
is anything but straight.

1011
00:57:29,660 --> 00:57:30,580
It's straight!

1012
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:31,780
What do you mean?

1013
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:34,060
It is so straight.

1014
00:57:34,140 --> 00:57:35,600
I don't know what you're talking about.

1015
00:57:35,860 --> 00:57:37,660
Yeah, that is definitely a straight line.

1016
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:38,860
Oh, you're talking about.

1017
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:44,700
Don't worry, don't worry.

1018
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:46,480
Maybe there's something wrong with your eyes.

1019
00:57:47,060 --> 00:57:47,280
You know?

1020
00:57:47,820 --> 00:57:50,200
Maybe I did buy the blind eye DLC.

1021
00:57:50,520 --> 00:57:50,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1022
00:57:51,080 --> 00:57:53,140
You got blind eye DLC.

1023
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:54,920
Oh, wait, there's some scents.

1024
00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:56,960
An oil lamp.

1025
00:57:57,480 --> 00:57:58,280
A cougar.

1026
00:57:59,060 --> 00:58:00,540
Oh, an elk herd is nearby.

1027
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:01,420
Okay, we don't...

1028
00:58:01,420 --> 00:58:02,500
What's this red?

1029
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:03,740
oil lamp thing.

1030
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:05,100
It stopped snowing.

1031
00:58:05,180 --> 00:58:06,380
I don't see the red oil lamp.

1032
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:07,220
That's only you.

1033
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:09,660
If you hold V, you press V.

1034
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:11,600
Do you see the question mark?

1035
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:12,380
Yeah, what the heck?

1036
00:58:12,500 --> 00:58:13,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1037
00:58:13,620 --> 00:58:14,760
I'm following it.

1038
00:58:15,020 --> 00:58:16,000
I'm gonna follow it.

1039
00:58:16,580 --> 00:58:17,460
Ground sense.

1040
00:58:17,780 --> 00:58:18,840
Pick up the object.

1041
00:58:19,740 --> 00:58:20,360
Wait, what?

1042
00:58:20,520 --> 00:58:21,940
Oh, it's a collectible!

1043
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:24,120

How do I un-airplane my ears?

1258
01:11:55,630 --> 01:11:57,030
You were born like that.

1259
01:11:57,090 --> 01:11:58,150
I was born.

1260
01:11:58,350 --> 01:12:00,290

Dirt, where are you?

1267
01:12:13,090 --> 01:12:13,130
He knows about holes.

1268
01:12:13,550 --> 01:12:15,470
He has the whole location.

1269
01:12:16,910 --> 01:12:17,910

1270
01:12:18,450 --> 01:12:19,110

1271
01:12:20,670 --> 01:12:21,650

Okay, okay, okay, okay.

1280
01:12:34,710 --> 01:12:36,430

1281
01:12:36,630 --> 01:12:37,550
He found him!

1282
01:12:40,240 --> 01:12:42,020
That's your fang and MC!

1283
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:44,100
You guys can never live up to dirt.

1284
01:12:46,700 --> 01:12:47,660
Dirt MVP.

1285
01:12:48,240 --> 01:12:48,960
Dirt MVP.

1286
01:12:48,980 --> 01:12:50,100
You guys could never.

1287
01:12:50,340 --> 01:12:54,000
Yeah, you guys could never live up to the expectations we
have now.

1288
01:12:54,360 --> 01:12:54,760
Yeah.

1289
01:12:55,640 --> 01:12:58,640
Dirt has said bars you wouldn't comprehend.

1290
01:12:58,860 --> 01:13:00,360
Yeah, you wouldn't comprehend.

1291
01:13:00,900 --> 01:13:01,900
This is the standard now.

1292
01:13:04,580 --> 01:13:06,760
This is our proud child.

1293
01:13:07,220 --> 01:13:07,840
Oh my god!

1294
01:13:08,140 --> 01:13:08,540
This is...

1295
01:13:08,540 --> 01:13:09,220
This is...

1296
01:13:09,220 --> 01:13:10,440
You know why it's better than...

1297
01:13:10,440 --> 01:13:10,640
That's a hole?

1298
01:13:10,860 --> 01:13:11,580
That's a hole?

1299
01:13:12,260 --> 01:13:13,060
How do we get in?

1300
01:13:13,300 --> 01:13:13,560
What the heck?

1301
01:13:13,940 --> 01:13:14,460
How do we...

1302
01:13:14,460 --> 01:13:15,400
Dirt, you know what?

1303
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:15,760
Dirt?

1304
01:13:16,340 --> 01:13:18,500
That's what I expected from a collared wolf.

1305
01:13:22,670 --> 01:13:24,250
From a collared wolf.

1306
01:13:24,630 --> 01:13:26,630
From a fucking collared wolf.

1307
01:13:29,790 --> 01:13:38,650
You're just never meant to be wild That's the king right
Show me your belly How do I make it mine?

1308
01:13:38,810 --> 01:13:39,750
Do I pee on it?

1309
01:13:40,230 --> 01:13:41,630
Yeah, you gotta pee on it.

1310
01:13:41,890 --> 01:13:42,730
Okay, me too.

1311
01:13:43,030 --> 01:13:44,510
Peep on the house to make a noise.

1312
01:13:47,050 --> 01:13:48,670
You're just not like us.

1313
01:13:48,790 --> 01:13:50,770
You're not savage enough like us.

1314
01:13:51,930 --> 01:13:53,530
Wait, did you just eat the...

1315
01:13:53,530 --> 01:13:53,790
Oh!

1316
01:13:57,270 --> 01:13:58,610
I ate the whole thing.

1317
01:13:58,670 --> 01:13:59,330
What the heck?

1318
01:14:00,990 --> 01:14:02,070
I guess I was hungry.

1319
01:14:03,150 --> 01:14:03,150
Holy shit.

1320
01:14:03,530 --> 01:14:04,090
Holy shit.

1321
01:14:04,510 --> 01:14:05,550
So how do we...

1322
01:14:05,550 --> 01:14:07,770
Let me look at the map real fast.

1323
01:14:07,950 --> 01:14:08,650
Is that our dead?

1324
01:14:09,610 --> 01:14:10,230
Is this ours?

1325
01:14:10,470 --> 01:14:11,130
Show all dead.

1326
01:14:11,250 --> 01:14:11,870
Yeah, it is.

1327
01:14:11,930 --> 01:14:12,550
It's ours!

1328
01:14:13,210 --> 01:14:13,970
Is it ours?

1329
01:14:13,990 --> 01:14:14,370

1330
01:14:14,450 --> 01:14:15,830
Alright, make this our territory, guys.

1331
01:14:16,030 --> 01:14:16,510

01:14:16,810 --> 01:14:17,110
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1333
01:14:17,130 --> 01:14:18,590
Start peeing around the trees.

1334
01:14:19,310 --> 01:14:19,590

1335
01:14:19,870 --> 01:14:20,630

Pee everywhere.

1338
01:14:24,350 --> 01:14:26,530

Oh, you can't catch me.

1740
01:36:25,450 --> 01:36:26,870

01:36:27,990 --> 01:36:29,250

1744
01:36:31,890 --> 01:36:32,790
We need to pee more.

1745
01:36:32,830 --> 01:36:34,130
It's not fully ours, yes.

1746
01:36:34,990 --> 01:36:36,330
It has to be fully ours.

1747
01:36:36,650 --> 01:36:37,670
It has to be more pee.

1748
01:36:37,870 --> 01:36:38,330
More yellow.

1749
01:36:39,110 --> 01:36:40,030

1750
01:36:40,930 --> 01:36:41,410
More pee.

1751
01:36:42,150 --> 01:36:45,290
Dang, did you find a den?

Why are you just peeing?

1753
01:36:47,070 --> 01:36:48,170
That's not your job.

1754
01:36:48,310 --> 01:36:49,910
Your job is to find the house.

1755
01:36:50,550 --> 01:36:57,050
Look, peep, performance review is like in two days and it
doesn't look really nice right now.

1756
01:36:59,110 --> 01:37:03,490
At this point, the best we can do is give you a nice
reference for your next job.

1757
01:37:04,390 --> 01:37:11,270
If you don't find it, then by the end of this day, that
performance review ain't gonna look so good, Vang.

1758
01:37:13,270 --> 01:37:15,790
You're gonna have some hold in your resume.

1759
01:37:16,190 --> 01:37:18,690
Yeah, you might need to update your resume soon.

1760

Did you kill the cat?

1778
01:38:46,610 --> 01:38:48,550
No, but I'm catching up to it.

That's okay.

1806
01:41:27,390 --> 01:41:30,210
That's why Fang is just an intern.

1807
01:41:31,330 --> 01:41:32,310
Pressure watching it.

1808
01:41:33,810 --> 01:41:41,330
Look, Fang, I hate to break it to you, but like, that
college reference, that extra credit, ain't looking so good,

1809
01:41:41,670 --> 01:41:41,670
Fang.

01:41:41,830 --> 01:41:42,450
You got it.

1811
01:41:42,850 --> 01:41:45,490
I don't know about the extra credit anymore.

1812
01:41:45,750 --> 01:41:46,750
Fang, you got it.

1813
01:41:46,890 --> 01:41:48,190
Fang is feeding me.

1814
01:41:48,210 --> 01:41:48,530
Dirt.

1815
01:41:49,190 --> 01:41:51,750
Oh, hang on.

1816
01:41:52,110 --> 01:41:54,990
I'm feeling dirt right now.

1817
01:41:55,430 --> 01:41:56,270
You know what?

1818
01:41:56,530 --> 01:41:57,610
That's a good intern.

1819
01:41:58,190 --> 01:42:00,090
Intern, show your belly to Fang.

1820
01:42:00,550 --> 01:42:02,710
Fang, show your belly to dirt or to me.

1821
01:42:03,170 --> 01:42:03,690
Show your belly.

1822
01:42:04,850 --> 01:42:05,350
That's right.

1823
01:42:05,610 --> 01:42:06,250
Show it.

1824
01:42:06,690 --> 01:42:07,770
Or I'm going to growl.

1825
01:42:09,310 --> 01:42:12,030
We have 15 out of 15 hexagons.

1826
01:42:12,310 --> 01:42:13,310
Oh, we did it.

1827
01:42:14,110 --> 01:42:14,910
Let's go.

1828
01:42:14,950 --> 01:42:15,530
We did it.

1829
01:42:15,550 --> 01:42:17,750
We just need to discover dense.

1830
01:42:19,170 --> 01:42:20,850
We just need dents.

1831
01:42:21,830 --> 01:42:22,010
All right.

1832
01:42:22,630 --> 01:42:22,690
All right.

1833
01:42:22,850 --> 01:42:25,410
Our main goal, we don't end stream until we have puppies.

1834
01:42:26,390 --> 01:42:26,730
That's our goal.

1835
01:42:26,810 --> 01:42:27,750
We need the puppies.

1836
01:42:28,270 --> 01:42:29,250
That is our...

1837
01:42:29,250 --> 01:42:30,470
We have to have...

1838
01:42:30,470 --> 01:42:34,870
I will make the 24-hour thing if I have to.

1839
01:42:35,210 --> 01:42:36,210
I need puppies.

1840
01:42:37,690 --> 01:42:40,530
We must be the worst WolfQuest players out there.

1841
01:42:40,590 --> 01:42:42,670
It takes us 24 hours.

1842
01:42:46,990 --> 01:42:48,190
I appreciate that.

1843
01:42:48,210 --> 01:42:50,690
It does not take 24 hours.

1844
01:42:51,310 --> 01:42:53,450
I'm like, it's 48 if I have to.

1845
01:42:55,210 --> 01:42:56,130
Dirt, stop hunting.

1846
01:42:56,390 --> 01:42:57,050
We need it.

1847
01:42:57,370 --> 01:42:58,390
We need a den.

1848
01:42:59,710 --> 01:43:00,730
You know, okay, no, that's fine.

1849
01:43:00,870 --> 01:43:01,790
Wait, you can eat for yourself?

1850
01:43:01,910 --> 01:43:02,450

1853
01:43:09,490 --> 01:43:10,470
Wait, where are you?

01:43:11,210 --> 01:43:11,890
You're at the border.

1856
01:43:11,990 --> 01:43:13,550
We don't need any more hexagons.

1857
01:43:14,550 --> 01:43:16,350
I am looking for a den.

1858
01:43:17,730 --> 01:43:17,970

The cheese is, like, fully hard on you.

1905
01:47:24,400 --> 01:47:30,680
It's like, it's like, we don't even buy it from a pizza
place.

1906
01:47:30,860 --> 01:47:34,200
We go to, like, a supermarket for those refrigerated pizzas.

1907
01:47:36,280 --> 01:47:38,080
The fucking oven pizzas.

1908
01:47:38,700 --> 01:47:43,940
Yeah, yeah, no, and then, but we get, like, a used pizza box
from, like, Domino's, and then put it in.

1909
01:47:45,180 --> 01:47:47,160
It's like fresh Domino's pizza.

1910
01:47:47,760 --> 01:47:48,140
Fresh Domino's pizza.

1911
01:47:48,140 --> 01:47:49,500
This doesn't look like Domino's pizza.

1912
01:47:49,800 --> 01:47:50,200
What the heck?

1913
01:47:50,360 --> 01:47:51,260
What are you trying to say?

1914
01:47:51,340 --> 01:47:52,800
It's in the pizza box.

1915
01:47:53,620 --> 01:47:55,060
What do you mean?

1916
01:47:55,640 --> 01:47:57,040
I'm saying I'm lying.

1917
01:47:57,320 --> 01:47:57,720
What the heck, man?

1918
01:47:57,720 --> 01:48:00,800
Are you trying to say your bosses are lying to you?

1919
01:48:00,940 --> 01:48:02,180
After everything we did.

1920
01:48:02,880 --> 01:48:05,000
After everything we've done.

1921
01:48:05,160 --> 01:48:08,020
Yeah, we opened the server for all of you guys.

1922
01:48:10,020 --> 01:48:13,700
It's almost like you don't appreciate our hardworking
supervisors.

1923
01:48:14,640 --> 01:48:17,140
Look at all these hexes we got for you.

1924
01:48:17,620 --> 01:48:21,060
All 15 of them was done from Lily and I.

1925
01:48:22,200 --> 01:48:25,700
And all we asked for you was a den.

1926
01:48:26,040 --> 01:48:28,120
A home, a place to call home.

1927
01:48:29,340 --> 01:48:31,480
We just wanted a place to call home.

1928
01:48:31,620 --> 01:48:33,260

That's right, that's when you know I'm alpha.

1948
01:49:07,940 --> 01:49:09,880
Don't even the snow parted.

01:49:10,120 --> 01:49:10,780

Oh my god, there's all of us.

1953
01:49:17,300 --> 01:49:18,320
It'd be cute.

01:49:18,700 --> 01:49:19,140
Look at us.

1955
01:49:19,200 --> 01:49:20,120
This is so cute.

1956
01:49:20,260 --> 01:49:22,000
Oh my god, look at all these wolves.

1957
01:49:23,300 --> 01:49:25,040
Look at all these wolf bees.

1958
01:49:25,340 --> 01:49:26,160
Oh my god.

1959
01:49:27,120 --> 01:49:28,000
It's daytime.

1960
01:49:29,660 --> 01:49:30,100
Yippee.

1961
01:49:30,620 --> 01:49:31,840
We're next to a den.

1962
01:49:32,140 --> 01:49:32,560
Wait, we are?

1963
01:49:32,840 --> 01:49:33,560
We are!

1964
01:49:33,920 --> 01:49:35,120
Guys, we did it!

1965
01:49:35,360 --> 01:49:35,760
What the heck?

1966
01:49:36,080 --> 01:49:36,940
We did it!

1967
01:49:38,200 --> 01:49:39,420
How do we...

1968
01:49:39,420 --> 01:49:40,480
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1969
01:49:40,780 --> 01:49:41,240
We have to kill her.

1970
01:49:41,400 --> 01:49:42,060
Okay, guys, come on.

1971
01:49:42,340 --> 01:49:42,960
Surround her.

1972
01:49:43,080 --> 01:49:43,460
Oh, we have to fight first.

1973
01:49:43,620 --> 01:49:44,160
Surround her.

1974
01:49:44,640 --> 01:49:46,640
This is our Surround her.

1975
01:49:46,780 --> 01:49:47,760
This is our den.

1976
01:49:48,280 --> 01:49:49,400
Our puppies will be here.

1977
01:49:49,660 --> 01:49:51,180
This is our children now.

1978
01:49:52,840 --> 01:49:54,720
This is for our pups only.

1979
01:49:55,080 --> 01:49:55,840
Our puppies.

1980
01:49:56,680 --> 01:49:58,300
Your bloodline ends here.

1981
01:50:00,880 --> 01:50:02,280
How is she still half HP?

1982
01:50:02,400 --> 01:50:04,000
There's literally four of us.

1983
01:50:04,440 --> 01:50:04,660
Right?

1984
01:50:04,880 --> 01:50:05,960
Like, no, she's strong.

1985
01:50:06,080 --> 01:50:07,920
Bro, how old is she?

1986
01:50:08,460 --> 01:50:09,620
That's not a wolf.

1987
01:50:09,820 --> 01:50:10,420
That's a cougar.

1988
01:50:10,680 --> 01:50:12,100
She can pack a pond, bro.

1989
01:50:12,440 --> 01:50:12,960
Whoa.

1990
01:50:15,180 --> 01:50:16,460
That's fucking right.

1991
01:50:17,080 --> 01:50:18,360
That's our home now.

1992
01:50:19,260 --> 01:50:20,160
Okay, how do we claim this?

1993
01:50:20,420 --> 01:50:20,800
Our den.

1994
01:50:21,420 --> 01:50:21,500
Piss.

1995
01:50:21,780 --> 01:50:22,580

1996
01:50:22,580 --> 01:50:23,860

01:50:31,880 --> 01:50:32,660
All right, Fing.

2002
01:50:33,420 --> 01:50:34,600
We need another home.

2003
01:50:34,680 --> 01:50:34,960
Fing!

2004
01:50:35,960 --> 01:50:38,080
You know, I'm going to splurge a little bit.

2005
01:50:38,220 --> 01:50:39,220
Now bring me food.

2006
01:50:39,460 --> 01:50:40,500
I'm ordering Uber Eats.

2007
01:50:41,660 --> 01:50:42,940
I would like...

2008
01:50:42,960 --> 01:50:44,160
One rabbit, please.

2009
01:50:45,360 --> 01:50:46,100
One rabbit, please.

2010
01:50:46,180 --> 01:50:46,920

2013
01:50:54,960 --> 01:50:56,320
A whole 10% tip.

2014
01:50:56,320 --> 01:51:00,740
A whole 10% tip if you get me that rabbit on Uber Eats.

2015
01:51:02,920 --> 01:51:04,800
We need two more.

2016
01:51:05,580 --> 01:51:06,580
Two more.

2017
01:51:06,840 --> 01:51:08,660
And then we'll have...

2018
01:51:08,660 --> 01:51:09,280
Puppers.

2019
01:51:10,900 --> 01:51:11,420
Puppers.

2020
01:51:11,420 --> 01:51:12,480
Reveal two dens.

2021
01:51:12,960 --> 01:51:14,340
Okay, you established and found several.

2022
01:51:14,460 --> 01:51:15,280
It's time to give your pack.

2023
01:51:15,540 --> 01:51:16,920
It's time to give our pack a name.

2024
01:51:17,240 --> 01:51:17,760
How should we name?

2025
01:51:17,820 --> 01:51:18,280
Oh, wait a minute.

2026
01:51:18,320 --> 01:51:19,540
Shrimp Groons Incorporated.

2027
01:51:20,800 --> 01:51:22,360
Shrimp Groons Incorporated.

2028
01:51:22,540 --> 01:51:23,100
Let's go.

2029
01:51:23,400 --> 01:51:23,940
There you go.

2030
01:51:24,980 --> 01:51:25,300
Continue.

2031
01:51:27,280 --> 01:51:27,940

Okay.

2033
01:51:29,120 --> 01:51:32,480
You want to keep working on territory and looking for gems
or proceed to choosing a den?

2034
01:51:32,600 --> 01:51:33,000
You know what?

2035
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:34,380

2036
01:51:34,500 --> 01:51:35,820

01:51:38,600 --> 01:51:38,960
All right.

2040
01:51:39,300 --> 01:51:42,280
Remember, you must maintain it even when your pups require
all your time.

2041
01:51:42,420 --> 01:51:48,260
The smaller your tank, They're more likely a stranger wolves
will be tempted to come in and kill your pups kill my

I still can't believe it was the last one to come out.

2165
01:58:47,980 --> 01:58:49,280
I still can't believe it.

2166
01:58:49,580 --> 01:58:50,620
I'm making a curse.

2167
01:58:50,800 --> 01:58:52,460

2168
01:58:55,160 --> 01:58:57,860

Everything away.

2182
01:59:23,560 --> 01:59:26,780
And I can't breathe either.

2183
01:59:27,660 --> 01:59:30,320
We worked so hard, Lily.

2184
01:59:31,860 --> 01:59:36,980
This is what we've been working for since we started this
company.

2185
01:59:38,320 --> 01:59:39,760
It's totally...

2186
01:59:39,760 --> 01:59:40,900
It's paying off.

2187
01:59:41,140 --> 01:59:42,020
Oh my god.

So they're more independent, so we don't have to come back
so they can fend for themselves.

2735
02:28:12,870 --> 02:28:13,750
So they can fuck off.

It's difficult, okay?

2920
02:37:08,480 --> 02:37:09,000
It's difficult.

2921
02:37:09,600 --> 02:37:12,600
You think you can hunt an elk on your own?

2922
02:37:13,260 --> 02:37:14,120
That's fucking right.

2923
02:37:14,760 --> 02:37:15,060
Ow!

2924
02:37:22,440 --> 02:37:23,600
No constipation!

2925
02:37:23,880 --> 02:37:24,620
Stop sleeping!

2926
02:37:25,380 --> 02:37:26,480
He's hungry!

2927
02:37:26,880 --> 02:37:27,780
I mean, he's sleepy!

2928
02:37:27,980 --> 02:37:28,680
Look at his...

2929
02:37:29,180 --> 02:37:30,700
He has 7% sleep!

2930
02:37:30,820 --> 02:37:31,860
What do you mean?

2931
02:37:32,500 --> 02:37:34,560
Why is he never sleeping?

2932
02:37:35,120 --> 02:37:35,860
What do you mean?

2933
02:37:35,920 --> 02:37:38,260
I mean he's actually EEPI.

2934
02:37:38,620 --> 02:37:40,220
I mean don't fucking sleep.

2935
02:37:40,380 --> 02:37:41,220
Your fucking...

2936
02:37:41,220 --> 02:37:44,840
Your fucking child is actually sleep deprived.

2937
02:37:46,220 --> 02:37:48,160
Why is he always EEPI?

2938
02:37:48,440 --> 02:37:49,840
He's playing too much video games.

2939
02:37:51,060 --> 02:37:51,980
I can't believe it.

2940
02:37:52,060 --> 02:37:52,920
I told you!

2941
02:37:53,160 --> 02:37:56,020
I told you making him play video games is a bad idea.

2942
02:37:56,960 --> 02:37:57,300
He should...

2943
02:37:57,300 --> 02:37:58,960
But someone has to farm gold.

2944
02:37:59,380 --> 02:37:59,700
Yes!

2945
02:38:01,960 --> 02:38:05,300
What's the point of raising offspring if they can't be gold
farmers?

2946
02:38:06,200 --> 02:38:07,920
Until your in-game chores.

2947
02:38:08,800 --> 02:38:10,980
Oh my god, there's so many walls on me!

2948
02:38:11,340 --> 02:38:12,760
Oh my god!

2949
02:38:13,720 --> 02:38:14,120
Guys!

2950
02:38:14,840 --> 02:38:15,440
I'm funny!

2951
02:38:15,880 --> 02:38:16,600
I'm dead!

2952
02:38:17,320 --> 02:38:17,520
I'm dead!

2953
02:38:18,820 --> 02:38:19,420
I'm dead!

2954
02:38:19,420 --> 02:38:20,500
Someone help me!

2955
02:38:21,420 --> 02:38:22,440
I got ambushed!

2956
02:38:22,880 --> 02:38:23,160
Wait, how far?

2957
02:38:23,280 --> 02:38:24,200
Wait, how far are you?

2958
02:38:24,220 --> 02:38:24,680
What the heck?

2959
02:38:24,900 --> 02:38:25,700
I got ambushed!

2960
02:38:25,980 --> 02:38:26,620
Oh my god!

2961
02:38:27,700 --> 02:38:29,020
Oh my god!

2962
02:38:29,540 --> 02:38:30,660
Wait, my god!

2963
02:38:30,660 --> 02:38:30,880
Oh!

2964
02:38:31,200 --> 02:38:32,020
Holy shit!

2965
02:38:32,240 --> 02:38:32,960
What the heck?

2966
02:38:34,460 --> 02:38:35,800
Someone revive me!

2967
02:38:35,920 --> 02:38:36,360
Ow!

2968
02:38:36,980 --> 02:38:37,080
Ow!

2969
02:38:37,740 --> 02:38:38,100
Ow!

2970
02:38:40,260 --> 02:38:41,060
Leave it up!

2971
02:38:41,100 --> 02:38:41,460

I got jumped!

2977
02:38:53,560 --> 02:38:54,280

2978
02:38:55,320 --> 02:38:55,640
No!

2979
02:38:55,960 --> 02:38:56,960
They can distract him!

2980
02:38:57,500 --> 02:38:58,300
Distract him!

2981
02:38:58,420 --> 02:38:59,040
I'm gonna live!

2982
02:38:59,280 --> 02:38:59,880

2983
02:38:59,880 --> 02:39:00,340

2984
02:39:01,220 --> 02:39:01,760

I'm so dead!

2990
02:39:18,680 --> 02:39:20,200
Ah, there's too many of them!

2991
02:39:20,820 --> 02:39:21,560
There's too many!

2992
02:39:22,100 --> 02:39:22,240

I'm ready.

2999
02:39:39,420 --> 02:39:40,240
Oh my god.

3000
02:39:40,840 --> 02:39:43,640
I accidentally invaded somebody else's territory.

3001
02:39:43,900 --> 02:39:44,720
I learned my lesson.

3002
02:39:45,000 --> 02:39:45,420
I'm sorry.

3003
02:39:45,660 --> 02:39:46,500
I learned my lesson.

3004
02:39:47,460 --> 02:39:48,560
I learned my lesson.

3005
02:39:49,100 --> 02:39:49,500
Holy shit.

3006
02:39:49,740 --> 02:39:50,580
Oh my god.

3007
02:39:50,740 --> 02:39:52,780
I'm so fucked up right now.

3008
02:39:53,220 --> 02:39:54,760
Dude, I'm almost dead.

3009
02:39:56,180 --> 02:39:56,980
Oh shit.

3010
02:39:58,040 --> 02:39:59,300
My leg.

3011
02:39:59,580 --> 02:40:00,360
Where am I?

3012
02:40:00,660 --> 02:40:01,680
Where's the children?

3013
02:40:02,500 --> 02:40:03,380
I need to sleep.

3014
02:40:04,100 --> 02:40:04,600
I need...

3015
02:40:04,600 --> 02:40:05,060
I'm EP.

3016
02:40:05,920 --> 02:40:06,640
I need an EP.

3017
02:40:07,960 --> 02:40:08,740
I need an EP.

3018
02:40:09,420 --> 02:40:10,000
EP time.

3019
02:40:10,800 --> 02:40:12,060
Good night, everybody.

3020
02:40:13,720 --> 02:40:14,740
Wait, what are children?

3021
02:40:15,240 --> 02:40:15,900
Are they inside?

3022
02:40:16,220 --> 02:40:16,460
Oh, okay.

3023
02:40:16,660 --> 02:40:17,140
They're all inside.

3024
02:40:17,320 --> 02:40:21,440
Me, me, me, me, me, me.

3025
02:40:22,240 --> 02:40:26,200
Me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me.

3026
02:40:28,600 --> 02:40:31,340
You're telling me to lose Blubber to run faster?

3027
02:40:31,500 --> 02:40:33,300
No, the Blubber is what saved me.

3028
02:40:33,880 --> 02:40:35,340
I had cushioning.

3029
02:40:35,360 --> 02:40:37,180
The extra armor fat.

3030
02:40:37,760 --> 02:40:38,280
Yeah.

3031
02:40:41,160 --> 02:40:42,800
Why is the fire in the forest?

3032
02:40:43,240 --> 02:40:45,320
Guys, don't go to the purple area.

3033
02:40:46,000 --> 02:40:47,000
It's dangerous.

3034
02:40:47,680 --> 02:40:49,120
Do not the purple.

3035
02:40:49,360 --> 02:40:50,540
The purple area.

3036
02:40:51,660 --> 02:40:52,980
Never go to purple.

3037
02:40:55,400 --> 02:40:55,920
Alright.

3038
02:40:56,180 --> 02:40:57,460
How much do they weigh now?

3039
02:40:58,600 --> 02:40:59,640
12.3.

3040
02:40:59,780 --> 02:41:00,380
Oh, there's 13.

3041
02:41:00,520 --> 02:41:01,500
We need two more pounds.

3042
02:41:02,340 --> 02:41:02,680
Guys.

3043
02:41:03,540 --> 02:41:03,720
Easy.

3044
02:41:04,140 --> 02:41:04,600
Two more pounds.

3045
02:41:05,420 --> 02:41:05,640
I can't.

3046
02:41:05,800 --> 02:41:06,960
I killed something.

3047
02:41:07,480 --> 02:41:09,060
It's spoiled probably.

3048
02:41:10,360 --> 02:41:11,800
I'm going to go hunt again.

3049
02:41:13,200 --> 02:41:13,660
Hunting die.

3050
02:41:13,800 --> 02:41:14,820
It's time to hunt.

3051
02:41:15,040 --> 02:41:16,480
I need to make sure I don't go to purple.

3052
02:41:16,760 --> 02:41:17,900
But my leg is broken.

3053
02:41:18,100 --> 02:41:19,500
I don't think I can hunt anything.

3054
02:41:21,020 --> 02:41:23,740
Look, I hunted with a broken jaw.

3055
02:41:24,340 --> 02:41:28,800
If I can do it, so can you.

3056
02:41:29,220 --> 02:41:29,300
Yeah.

3057
02:41:30,200 --> 02:41:32,060
Don't be a fucking coward.

3058
02:41:32,300 --> 02:41:33,360
Don't be a baby.

3059
02:41:34,800 --> 02:41:36,820
Don't be a baby, baby.

3060
02:41:37,900 --> 02:41:40,060
Our children need food.

3061
02:41:40,240 --> 02:41:43,220
Do you want them to starve after everything we've been
through?

3062
02:41:43,760 --> 02:41:44,280
I would never.

3063
02:41:44,480 --> 02:41:47,160

02:41:55,920 --> 02:41:59,560
Look, it's all about killing the baby so that our babies can
survive.

Okay.

3265
02:53:50,440 --> 02:53:51,000
Poor genetics.

3266
02:53:51,340 --> 02:53:53,580

What can I say?

3268
02:53:54,380 --> 02:53:55,120
It's his most fault.

3269
02:53:55,600 --> 02:53:57,440
I'm a strong genetic wolf.

3270
02:54:01,300 --> 02:54:02,680
It's not my fault.

3271
02:54:03,000 --> 02:54:04,140
I blame the mother.

3272
02:54:05,700 --> 02:54:07,520
I blame whoever is the mother.

3273
02:54:08,080 --> 02:54:13,400
My genes gave him the best possible genes.

3274
02:54:14,080 --> 02:54:14,600

You did not.

3452
03:03:54,020 --> 03:03:55,720
You would have been named constipation.

3453
03:03:55,800 --> 03:03:56,680
It's not what you wanted.

3454
03:03:57,860 --> 03:03:59,600
If she was your mom.

3455
03:04:00,220 --> 03:04:01,520
You want constipation.

3456
03:04:02,340 --> 03:04:04,720
That would have been your name if it wasn't for me.

3457

It's not that bad, mom.

3458
03:04:12,320 --> 03:04:13,860
No one bought this constipation.

03:04:20,200 --> 03:04:20,920
Constipation.

Yes, he has constipation.

3465
03:04:23,480 --> 03:04:26,460
It's Latin for peace.

3466
03:04:27,940 --> 03:04:30,340
God, you're so insensitive, mom.

3467
03:04:31,920 --> 03:04:33,940
Mom, please, it's 2024.

3468
03:04:34,280 --> 03:04:35,280
Grow up.

3469
03:04:35,680 --> 03:04:38,060

3470
03:04:38,500 --> 03:04:38,940
Okay.

3471
03:04:39,760 --> 03:04:40,400
Wait, what?

3472
03:04:40,640 --> 03:04:44,000
They lost their child for like five seconds.

3473
03:04:46,780 --> 03:04:48,560
I need to break.

3474
03:04:48,620 --> 03:04:48,920

3475
03:04:49,120 --> 03:04:51,220
Wait, get your child!

3476
03:04:51,480 --> 03:04:53,420
How did you lose your kid?

3477
03:04:56,000 --> 03:04:57,500

3480
03:05:06,880 --> 03:05:08,640

3481

I like how someone's like, Mom, it's 2024!

3482
03:05:13,080 --> 03:05:15,460
Constipation is a common name!

3483
03:05:19,120 --> 03:05:19,560
Okay.

3484
03:05:23,770 --> 03:05:25,840
Get off the times, mom.

3485
03:05:26,180 --> 03:05:27,980
Okay, here, this is my Moran Nebu site.

3486
03:05:28,360 --> 03:05:30,060

I'm really thankful for the help of little man.

3565
03:12:27,870 --> 03:12:29,890
Yes, little man.

3566
03:12:30,670 --> 03:12:33,270
They've been helping me a lot with setting all the auction
stuff.

3567
03:12:33,590 --> 03:12:39,630
They've actually helped me with like getting in touch with
like Tiltify and like the the Brain and Behavior Foundation,

3568
03:12:39,870 --> 03:12:40,650
Research Foundation.

3569
03:12:41,290 --> 03:12:46,490
They've been working really hard on setting everything up
for us and listing up all the auction items.

3570
03:12:46,850 --> 03:12:48,870
I'm super duper excited.

3571
03:12:49,190 --> 03:12:56,030
I'll give you guys those who are the member stream i can
give you guys a sneak peek of like some of the items uh let

3572
03:12:56,030 --> 03:13:05,030
me see if i can find um i'll give you a sneak peek of some
of the items so for example this will be in the auction one

3573
03:13:05,030 --> 03:13:14,850
of them because the other one's for me but here are some of
the items that will be in uh the auction so like a two of a

3574
03:13:14,850 --> 03:13:25,030
kind the other one is for me so technically two of a kind
plush um and uh they are currently setting it up at the

3575
03:13:25,030 --> 03:13:31,290
moment so like some stuff to look forward to uh the stream
itself it's just it's gonna be very random there'd be like

3576
03:13:31,290 --> 03:13:39,350
some stretch goals and everything um and uh um i'm still
trying to figure out what to do on the stream but uh the

3577
03:13:39,350 --> 03:13:47,710
auction might start uh tonight or before the stream starts
and um lil mad told me to let you guys know that if you're

3578
03:13:47,710 --> 03:13:57,670
looking to bid on the item, you need to have a Tiltify
account and you have to link a payment method and your

3579
03:13:57,670 --> 03:13:59,190
address on your account.

3580
03:13:59,450 --> 03:14:09,930
Your account has to be registered on Tiltify and also have
payment method linked as well as your address registered.

3581
03:14:10,250 --> 03:14:14,890
So you'll be able to bid on the items.

3582
03:14:16,030 --> 03:14:17,170
So like, I'm just needing it.

3583
03:14:17,190 --> 03:14:24,050
guys to remind you guys about it how a charity stream be um
i will try my best to stream as long as i can i won't i

3584
03:14:24,050 --> 03:14:31,730
don't want to force myself too hard to stream a very long
time but the auction itself would be around will be uh will

3585
03:14:31,730 --> 03:14:41,430
last all the way for 24 hours uh that is my hope um so if we
do or for or two days i want the auction to be around two

3586
03:14:41,430 --> 03:14:49,790
days uh so people have as much time to bid it and everything
so i'm gonna try and have the auction itself be two days um

3587
03:14:49,790 --> 03:14:58,050
there is around 30 items in the auction and i'm super duper
excited uh i'm super duper excited for the auction and hope

3588
03:14:58,050 --> 03:15:09,210
that um a lot of you guys enjoy some of the items that's on
there um but yeah i hope you guys had a great time um with

3589
03:15:09,210 --> 03:15:16,570

but also i'm always super nervous when collabing because um

3601
03:15:59,990 --> 03:16:07,550
i i you know when it's like new people i don't know what the
chemistry is like so like um i try to pick games out that i

3602
03:16:07,550 --> 03:16:16,750
feel would work the best between us and everything and uh um
so i It's so, it's always so nerve-wracking before a collab

3603
03:16:16,750 --> 03:16:21,110
because I don't know what the chemistry is going to be like
and everything like as like a one-to-one thing.

3604
03:16:22,050 --> 03:16:28,350
And, um, and I'm just happy that Lily enjoyed herself and we
all had a great time.
