1
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,040
Hello, hello everybody!

2
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:53,880
Welcome back to Goodnight Dragoons!

3
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,360
Yes, we are back!

4
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:57,980
Alright, let me play some Lo-Fi real quick.

5
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,580
Alright, let's see.

6
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,540
Gotta make that a little quieter.

7
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,000
Alright!

8
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,860
Oh my gosh, my voice is so fucked right now.

9
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:09,720
Cough drops right now.

10
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:11,620
You know, I didn't stream as much.

11
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:17,060
I guess it's because I'm not used to streaming super long hours lately.

12
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:19,820
And I've done a lot of long hour streams this week.

13
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:26,480
And I haven't really managed to cool down and let my voice rest in a while.

14
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,600
So yeah, during the...

15
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:30,400
I'm so

16
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,780
needy right now because I was just lying down in bed.

17
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:46,480
I was lying down in bed and he was on top of my legs.

18
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:47,200
So I couldn't...

19
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,840
I couldn't move because he was like, like, he was just like being cozy on my legs.

20
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:53,420
And I was like, I don't want to move.

21
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:54,860
I don't want to...

22
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:56,520
No, what is he barking about?

23
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,760
What the fuck is he barking about?

24
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,640
Oh, okay.

25
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:02,540
Give me a sec.

26
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:03,580
I'll be right...

27
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:04,460
I need to check on him.

28
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,560
I don't know what he's barking about.

29
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,280
I'll be right back.

30
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,860
I mean, he's not barking at the door.

31
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:11,360
That's the thing.

32
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:31,300
He's just being in attention.

33
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,380
I'm like, can I say that about my dog?

34
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:46,440
Like, I hesitate a little bit.

35
00:03:55,140 --> 00:04:03,880
I literally, I literally like, um, I, I checked up cause he's like, he doesn't want to sleep on a dog bed anymore.

36
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:04,940
He sleeps on my bed.

37
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:12,560
And then, um, I literally went over, checked on him and he's just sitting on my bed and just like...

38
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,360
Like he was just underneath the blankets.

39
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,700
And this was his expression.

40
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,900
Like, he wasn't even like off the...

41
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:27,420
He was just, he just barked just cause he knows it'll bring me over.

42
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,500
Cause I'm like, what's wrong?

43
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,640
And he was like, got it.

44
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:31,180
Got her.

45
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,160
Get baited.

46
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:36,800
Get out of here.

47
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,600
Fuck you, bitch.

48
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:41,020
Oh my God.

49
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:42,640
Where was I?

50
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:44,240
Um, yeah.

51
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:49,220
My voice is not doing, uh, during the, uh, lockdown protocol.

52
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:52,500
My voice was not doing so great during some of it.

53
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:56,640
So, um, so I'm going to...

54
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,260
All right.

55
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,140
For real.

56
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,080
Next week.

57
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,240
It's just going to be Sajab slam streams.

58
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:03,240
I'm just going to let you guys know right now.

59
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,820
Or N plus one Wooka.

60
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:09,000
Next week, we're just going to have, uh, Sajab slam streams.

61
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:10,800
So like during the tournament.

62
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:14,820
So there'll be like two stream, three streams next week, for real.

63
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,360
For real.

64
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,900
There's going to be three, three streams.

65
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,320
Next week for real.

66
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:21,860
Only.

67
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:25,180
Have I practiced yet?

68
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:25,440
No.

69
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,240
I haven't practiced yet.

70
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:34,020
I literally, um, I asked like our coach, Brian.

71
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:34,800
Cause like...

72
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,940
This is what I wrote.

73
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:38,580
I don't know if you guys know what I wrote here.

74
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:41,420
I was like...

75
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,040
Let's see.

76
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,040
I don't know what I'm doing.

77
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:47,140
I literally just spent five moves on King during Tekken Slam.

78
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,420
And I'm playing Modern GeForce Street Fighter.

79
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:57,720
You have to talk to me in PlayStation controller symbols for me to understand inputs and combos.

80
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:04,600
I was like, please do not use any actual FGC terminology.

81
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,780
Please speak to me in PlayStation controller symbols.

82
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:12,320
Because that is the only way I can understand what the fuck I'm doing.

83
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:14,800
That's the only way.

84
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:20,740
I was like, what the fuck?

85
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:21,980
I don't understand the colors.

86
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,900
You know, like in the Street Fighter, it was like...

87
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:27,700
Left... left...

88
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,800
Left... yellow...

89
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,200
I'm like, what the fuck is yellow?

90
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:31,860
What the fuck?

91
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,600
What the fuck is...

92
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,820
What the fuck are...

93
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:36,080
What does red mean?

94
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,020
What the fuck does yellow mean?

95
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:38,840
I don't know.

96
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:39,980
Like...

97
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,220
Red equals heavy.

98
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:43,300
Which one's heavy?

99
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:45,240
What the fuck is heavy?

100
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:50,960
So just... just say square, triangle, X, or circle.

101
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:52,140
Like...

102
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:55,520
It's time.

103
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,700
If I didn't learn the proper...

104
00:06:58,180 --> 00:06:58,620
Names...

105
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:00,140
Of my controller...

106
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:01,480
During Tekken...

107
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,400
I will not need...

108
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,540
I will not learn during Street Fighter.

109
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,020
I'll never learn.

110
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:11,760
That's the joy of being a VTuber.

111
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,500
I don't know.

112
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:16,160
Thank you for the super chat.

113
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:16,440
Thank you.

114
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:16,960
Thank you.

115
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:17,960
Doki Yap stream.

116
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,180
Give me the sweet...

117
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,280
Jiminy squirrel words, Miss Bird.

118
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:22,240
Thank you for the super chat.

119
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:22,580
Thank you.

120
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,140
Thank you.

121
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:23,720
Zonderman.

122
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:24,940
Thank you for the super chat.

123
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:25,400
Thank you.

124
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:25,960
Thank you.

125
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:26,240
God.

126
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:26,800
You're...

127
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,480
Thank you for the super chat.

128
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:29,300
Thank you.

129
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:30,600
Um...

130
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,640
But yeah.

131
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:32,640
Um...

132
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,200
I mean...

133
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,220
I learn pretty fast.

134
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:35,420
Honestly.

135
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:36,100
Like...

136
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:36,920
I don't know...

137
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,520
Like...

138
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,080
I'm not tuning my own horn here.

139
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:40,100
Uh...

140
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:40,940
But like...

141
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:43,360
I feel like...

142
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,820
I do learn pretty fast.

143
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,300
As long as like...

144
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,260
I'm given like...

145
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:49,380
Straight directions on what to do.

146
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,160
Like...

147
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,180
As long as you don't overwhelm me...

148
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,020
On like...

149
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:53,620
What to do.

150
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,000
I can learn...

151
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:55,800
Pretty fast.

152
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,240
Like...

153
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,520
You just give me like...

154
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:57,980
Um...

155
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:58,560
Just be like...

156
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,120
Just do this.

157
00:07:59,240 --> 00:07:59,780
And I'll be like...

158
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:00,060
Okay.

159
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,680
And then I just brute force the learning.

160
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:03,760
I can do long training sessions.

161
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:04,240
Like...

162
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,540
I can play rank for a very long time.

163
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:07,380
If I want to.

164
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:08,860
Um...

165
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:09,340
Well...

166
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:10,360
Currently, I don't want to.

167
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,120
So...

168
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,120
Currently...

169
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,720
Currently, I don't want to.

170
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:16,740
But like...

171
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:18,320
When I get into it...

172
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:18,580
Like...

173
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:18,800
I...

174
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,820
That's how I got into red rank, guys.

175
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:21,360
You remember?

176
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,860
I think my favorite part...

177
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:24,020
Like...

178
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:24,840
One of my favorite parts...

179
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:25,460
During the...

180
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:26,260
Uh...

181
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,040
Tekken...

182
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:27,640
Uh...

183
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,240
Slam...

184
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,260
Was like...

185
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:29,920
When...

186
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:30,440
Uh...

187
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,320
When...

188
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:31,880
Um...

189
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:32,460
Other...

190
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:33,060
Other...

191
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:34,180
Opponents...

192
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,180
My other opponents...

193
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:36,340
During the Tekken Slam...

194
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:36,920
Would be like...

195
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:37,540
Wait...

196
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:39,420
How did she get to red rank already?

197
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,440
And they're like...

198
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,880
Wasn't she like...

199
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,100
Wasn't she like...

200
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,100
Silver yesterday?

201
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:46,620
I...

202
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,240
I remember...

203
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,580
I don't remember who said that...

204
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:51,840
But I remember somebody on...

205
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,960
The enemy team...

206
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:53,360
Was like...

207
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:53,700
Out of...

208
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:54,280
Wait...

209
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,260
I thought she was like...

210
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,260
Silver yesterday...

211
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:58,240
How the fuck did she get to red rank already?

212
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:00,500
And...

213
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:01,680
Uh...

214
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:02,600
Um...

215
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,240
And like...

216
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:05,480
It...

217
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:05,820
Like...

218
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,760
I can grind rank if I want to...

219
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,180
I just...

220
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:08,540
Like...

221
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:08,720
I...

222
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,380
Like...

223
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:11,000
I just need to get into the mindset...

224
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,720
I'm not in the mindset at the moment...

225
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,600
Just cause like...

226
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,000
I don't know what I'm doing...

227
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:15,560
But like...

228
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,640
The moment I start...

229
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,820
Understanding what I'm doing...

230
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:19,680
Um...

231
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,220
Cause like...

232
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:21,620
I still don't know what I'm doing...

233
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:21,820
Like...

234
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:22,380
Oh yeah...

235
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:23,560
And then my coach...

236
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:24,260
Was like...

237
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:24,900
It's better...

238
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:25,900
Since you're playing...

239
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:26,900
Modern Geve...

240
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:27,920
It's better...

241
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,540
That you don't know what you're doing...

242
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:30,300
And then I was like...

243
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:30,600
Okay...

244
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,600
Then I'm not incur...

245
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:31,900
Like...

246
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:33,820
I'm not motivated...

247
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:35,760
If...

248
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,740
If I don't know what I'm doing...

249
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:38,820
I'm not as motivated...

250
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:40,460
To like...

251
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:40,900
Play...

252
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:41,520
Cause I was like...

253
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,460
Then what's the point...

254
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:43,440
If I don't know...

255
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:47,580
So...

256
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:48,840
Um...

257
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,100
So like...

258
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:50,360
Yeah...

259
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:50,820
So I was like...

260
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:50,980
Well...

261
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:52,220
Might as well not learn...

262
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:52,500
Like...

263
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:56,480
Um...

264
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,280
Haha...

I am very behind...

303
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,740
On a lot of work...

Behind the scenes...

309
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:33,260
At the moment...

310
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:34,160
Um...

Adult business stuff...

324
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,180

Like I had to actually go to an office...

344
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:11,020
In person...

345
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:11,700

Super important...

349
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:15,120

00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,080
Oh...

It's so...

371
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:35,460
Tiring...

372
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:36,880
It's really tiring...

373
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:37,440
Hahaha...

374
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:39,480

00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:53,540
Hahaha...

389
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:55,720
I'm just like...

390
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,660
Yeah...

391
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:57,120
Hahaha...

392
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:57,980
Yeah...

393
00:11:57,980 --> 00:11:59,400
I understand...

394
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:00,620
Hahaha...

395
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:02,170
Hahaha...

396
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:02,620
Hahaha...

397
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:02,920
Hahaha...

398
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,720
Oh my god...

399
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,000
But...

400
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
That's all I'll say...

401
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,800
That's all I'll say about it...

402
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:08,540
Um...

403
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:09,880
And...

404
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:10,740
Oh my gosh...

405
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:11,120
It's...

406
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:11,920
Like...

407
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,600
I learned so much about like...

408
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,760
Retainer fees...

409
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:15,960
And everything...

410
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:16,880
And then...

411
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:17,780
Um...

412
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:19,080
And then they're like...

413
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:19,960
What do you do?

414
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,820
And I was like...

415
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:23,780
Entertainment...

416
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:24,580
Hahaha...

417
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:25,240
They're like...

418
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:25,700
So...

419
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:26,660
I can't be like...

420
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:27,380
A DA...

421
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:28,540
Because they're literally like...

422
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:29,080
Lawyers...

423
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,120
So I was like...

424
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:31,520
Entertainment...

425
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:31,860
Hahaha...

426
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:33,160
They're like...

427
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:33,960
They're like...

428
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:34,520
Okay...

429
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,080
But like...

430
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,480
You gotta be specific...

431
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:36,960
And I was like...

432
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:47,400
Um...

433
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:50,620
Hahaha...

434
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:51,640
Hahaha...

435
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:54,880
It was...

436
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:55,740
It was like...

437
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:56,260
Oh my gosh...

438
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:57,260
It's so tiring...

439
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:59,640
I've been through so many meetings already...

440
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,320
Um...

441
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:00,960
But yeah...

442
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:01,360
It's been...

443
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:01,820
It's been...

444
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:02,300
Busy...

445
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:02,720
Busy...

446
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,240
Busy...

447
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,240
Going outside...

448
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,020
I hate being an adult...

449
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:06,540
I hate...

450
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:06,940
And then they're like...

451
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:08,900
Ahhhh...

452
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:09,600
And then...

453
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,820
The lawyer...

454
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:12,380
Was explaining to me...

455
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:12,940
About bookkeeping...

456
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:15,640
And I was like...

457
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:15,880
What?

458
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:17,280
They're like...

459
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,980
You need a bookkeeper...

460
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:19,660
And I was like...

461
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:20,740
A bookkeeper?

462
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:21,620
Like...

463
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:21,940
Yes...

464
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:23,080
You need a bookkeeper...

465
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:23,540
To like...

466
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:24,210
Help with everything...

467
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:25,800
I was like...

468
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:27,920
Okay...

469
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:28,480
Hahaha...

470
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,400
Do you need...

471
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,920
Oh my god...

472
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:31,700
I need a...

473
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:32,360
But I was like...

474
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,260
But what does...

475
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:35,000
What's the difference between...

476
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:36,720
Bookkeeping...

477
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:36,920
And...

478
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:38,180
Having...

479
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:39,260
An...

480
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:40,280
An account...

481
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,040
And they're like...

482
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:41,800
Well...

483
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:42,400
I...

484
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:42,820
And then...

485
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:44,000
One of the lawyer...

486
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,460
The lawyer meeting I had...

487
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:46,140
They were like...

488
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:46,820
Well...

489
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:49,060
Having a...

490
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:49,500
Well...

491
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,200
Having a...

492
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:50,700
Like...

493
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:51,420
Um...

494
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:52,600
Having a...

495
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,300
Uh...

496
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:53,980
Account...

497
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:55,940
It's advised not to have your account...

498
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:57,040
And do the bookkeeping...

499
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,820
Because it's a lot more expensive...

500
00:13:58,820 --> 00:13:59,780
I was like...

501
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:00,380
But...

502
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:00,880
How...

503
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:01,200
What?

504
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:01,720
And they're like...

505
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,240
It's better to do it in house...

506
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:03,860
And I was like...

507
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,500
Math me no good...

508
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,600
Math me...

509
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:12,840
Math...

510
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,780
Math me no good at...

511
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:16,040
Number hard...

512
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,860
Number hard...

513
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:20,860
So...

514
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:21,980
Yeah...

515
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:22,580
So...

516
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:23,220
It's...

517
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:24,200
Oh my gosh...

518
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,380
I'm just tired...

519
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:25,720
I said...

520
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,340
So that is why we haven't had...

521
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:28,780
Good night dragoons...

522
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:30,040
In a while...

523
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,060
And why I've been like...

524
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:31,800
Super busy...

525
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:32,880
Behind the scenes...

526
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,180
And why I've been behind...

527
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:35,260
A lot of stuff...

528
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:36,900
Because I've been trying to figure out...

529
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:37,440
How...

530
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,780
What to prioritize...

531
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:39,840
And like...

532
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,060
What to prioritize first...

533
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:42,420
And like...

534
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:43,520
What to do first...

535
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:43,860
And then...

536
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:44,920
And then I just...

537
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:45,140
I...

538
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:45,560
I...

539
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:46,540
I fall asleep...

540
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:47,720
And then I just go to bed...

541
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,100
I can't...

542
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:48,820
I'm too tired...

543
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:54,570
Um...

544
00:14:55,090 --> 00:14:55,810
Let's see...

545
00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:56,450
Uh...

546
00:14:56,450 --> 00:14:56,830
Epi...

547
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:57,730
Thank you for the super chat...

548
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:58,010
Thank you...

549
00:14:58,010 --> 00:14:58,530
Thank you...

550
00:14:58,530 --> 00:14:59,150
A bit late...

551
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:00,270
But thank you for coming to...

552
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:01,570
Animangaki Malaysia...

553
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:03,710
Super glad I got the chance to talk to you...

554
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:04,770
During the meet and greet session...

555
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:06,950
Two minutes is way too short...

556
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:07,870
Thank you for the super chat...

557
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:08,130
Thank you...

558
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:08,770
Thank you...

559
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:09,370
Epi...

560
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:10,130
Um...

561
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:10,590
Yeah...

562
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:11,730
It's so hard...

563
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:12,650
Um...

564
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:13,690
It's so...

565
00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:14,050
Okay...

566
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:14,390
Oh...

567
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:15,810
That is not very encouraging...

568
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:17,590
Had to be my own bookkeeper once...

569
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:18,850
It is the most terrifying...

570
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:20,470
And stressful jobs on earth...

571
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:21,270
That is...

572
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:22,390
Ooh...

573
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,190
Not looking forward to that...

574
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:27,010
Well obviously...

575
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:28,110
I'm not gonna do it...

576
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:30,130
I'm not gonna...

577
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:31,690
Obviously...

578
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:33,550
I'm not gonna be doing that...

579
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:36,050
Um...

580
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:37,910
I'm not gonna be doing that myself...

581
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:38,290
But yeah...

582
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:39,010
That's why I've been like...

583
00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:39,670
Super...

584
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:42,270
Up behind on a lot of stuff...

585
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:42,750
Um...

586
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:43,890
And like...

587
00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:44,370
Uh...

588
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:45,130
Yeah...

589
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:45,750
So...

590
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:46,810
Everything...

591
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:47,830
Everything's a little...

592
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:48,490
Okay...

593
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:49,150
I won't lie...

594
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:50,550
It's not a little bit of a mess...

595
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:50,850
It's a...

596
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:51,210
It's a...

597
00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:52,530
Bit of a big mess...

598
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:52,810
But...

599
00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:54,470
We're gonna...

600
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:55,130
We're gonna...

601
00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:56,530
We're gonna fix it!

602
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:58,970
We're gonna fix it soon!

603
00:15:59,170 --> 00:15:59,830
I swear!

604
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:02,150
It'll get better soon!

605
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:03,490
I swear!

606
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:05,610
When everything calms down...

607
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:05,870
That is...

608
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:06,910
This is also why...

609
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:08,070
I am...

610
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:09,210
Not streaming...

611
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:10,510
A lot next week...

612
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:11,270
Because...

613
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:11,630
Um...

614
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:12,290
I have to...

615
00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:13,450
Do a lot of stuff...

616
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:14,330
Behind the scenes...

617
00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:15,070
To catch up...

618
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:15,830
To fully...

619
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:17,630
The moving part did not help...

620
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:18,590
That's for sure...

621
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:19,730
The moving part...

622
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:20,430
Actually did...

623
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:21,810
Definitely did not help...

624
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:22,530
With the whole...

625
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:24,350
Being behind on everything...

626
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:28,690
So...

627
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:29,490
So...

628
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:29,970
So...

629
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:30,570
That's why...

630
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:31,070
So...

631
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:31,130
So...

632
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:31,150
That's why...

633
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:31,290
So like...

634
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:33,250
That's why I'm even more behind...

635
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:36,890
We can fix it...

636
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:37,930
We can fix it...

637
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:38,050
I...

638
00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:38,770
I believe...

639
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:40,210
As long as you guys believe...

640
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:41,830
Then like...

641
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:42,930
I believe...

642
00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:45,110
Also the PC issues...

643
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:45,710
Yeah...

644
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:46,410
You know like...

645
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:46,690
Okay...

646
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:48,090
What's funny was that like...

647
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:49,790
Hyatt was like...

648
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:49,970
Do...

649
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:52,430
Should we just send in one of our own guys...

650
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:53,030
To like...

651
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:54,250
Figure this out...

652
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:55,290
And I was like...

653
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:55,930
You know...

654
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:56,190
You...

655
00:16:56,950 --> 00:16:58,490
That would be great...

656
00:16:58,490 --> 00:16:59,590
Because then...

657
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:01,290
I don't have to like...

658
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:01,970
Fucking...

659
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:04,210
Carry this PC to the shop...

660
00:17:04,210 --> 00:17:04,790
So like...

661
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:05,770
Potentially...

662
00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:06,430
The...

663
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:07,210
Hyatt people...

664
00:17:07,210 --> 00:17:07,890
Might send...

665
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:08,030
The PC...

666
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:08,530
Someone...

667
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:08,930
Over...

668
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:09,530
To be like...

669
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:11,410
What the fuck is going on...

670
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:12,890
With the PC...

671
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:15,390
I...

672
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:16,090
I...

673
00:17:16,090 --> 00:17:16,830
Maybe...

674
00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:17,490
Maybe...

675
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:19,150
We can fix the PC too...

676
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:23,490
Um...

677
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:25,450
So yeah...

678
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:27,530
So that's basically what's going on...

679
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:29,230
With my life at the moment...

680
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:30,230
Um...

681
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:31,710
Fuzzy...

682
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:32,530
Thank you for the super chat...

683
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:32,770
Thank you...

684
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:33,410
Thank you...

685
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:35,010
I can't believe my tomato...

686
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:35,470
Oshi...

687
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:37,030
Has the time management skills...

688
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:37,630
Of a tomato...

689
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:38,170
You know...

690
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:39,190
Thank you for the super chat...

691
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:39,450
Thank you...

692
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:39,990
Thank you...

693
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:41,170
I think it just doesn't help...

694
00:17:41,170 --> 00:17:41,870
That everything...

695
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:42,250
Like...

696
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:42,810
Um...

697
00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:44,170
Built up...

698
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:44,970
And then like...

699
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:46,430
It was hard to catch up...

700
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:47,310
When so many things...

701
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:48,270
Kept popping up...

702
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:48,830
And stuff...

703
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:49,530
And there's like...

704
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:50,410
A lot of like...

705
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:51,070
Um...

706
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,730
Business adulting things...

707
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:53,970
That I have to do...

708
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:54,850
And like...

709
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:55,390
I obviously...

710
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:56,430
I couldn't like...

711
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:56,910
Uh...

712
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:57,810
What's the word...

713
00:17:57,810 --> 00:17:58,990
I couldn't like...

714
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:00,370
Um...

715
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:01,150
Stall it...

716
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:01,770
I have to like...

717
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:02,670
Focus on that...

718
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:03,090
And stuff...

719
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:03,550
And that was like...

720
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:04,450
Majority of my time...

721
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:05,110
And everything...

722
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:06,090
So it's just...

723
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:06,950
It's been like...

724
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:08,230
Being a...

725
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:08,950
Just...

726
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:09,550
I would say that...

727
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:10,830
Running your own business...

728
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:12,990
Has to be one of the hardest things...

729
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:13,850
I've ever done...

730
00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:14,850
I've...

731
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:15,350
Um...

732
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:16,350
But I'm...

733
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:16,770
Learning...

734
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:19,310
It is a great learning experience though...

735
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:19,850
Like...

736
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:20,210
I'm...

737
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:21,550
Okay...

738
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:22,670
With...

739
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:23,110
Uh...

740
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:24,370
Making mistakes...

741
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:25,170
Now...

742
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:26,350
And using that...

743
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:28,170
As a learning experience...

744
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:28,810
To be...

745
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:30,010
A better adult...

746
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:30,810
Person...

747
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:35,570
So like...

748
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:36,390
Um...

749
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:37,810
So like...

750
00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:38,210
I...

751
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:39,210
I'm like...

752
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:39,990
Happy...

753
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:40,410
With...

754
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:41,750
It's very stressful...

755
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:42,170
It may...

756
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:43,070
Might be like...

757
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:44,690
Very stressful...

758
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:45,890
But like...

759
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:46,450
Um...

760
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:48,470
Dealing with it now...

761
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:50,350
Rather than dealing with it later...

762
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:51,050
And having...

763
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:52,910
No adult experience...

764
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:53,530
Um...

765
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:54,550
I feel like...

766
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:55,130
You know...

767
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:55,850
I don't want to get...

768
00:18:55,850 --> 00:18:56,630
Be coddled...

769
00:18:56,630 --> 00:18:57,190
And everything...

770
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:58,590
I want to be involved...

771
00:18:58,590 --> 00:18:59,790
With these decisions...

772
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:00,650
Because like...

773
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:00,790
You know...

774
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:01,830
Having that...

775
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:02,670
Knowledge...

776
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:04,070
And having that experience...

777
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:04,670
Is like...

778
00:19:04,670 --> 00:19:05,670
Super helpful...

779
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:06,310
And everything...

780
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:06,770
Also...

781
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:08,650
Lawyers are fucking expensive...

782
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:09,590
Holy shit...

783
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:12,930
Like...

784
00:19:12,930 --> 00:19:13,550
Like...

785
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:15,410
I learned...

786
00:19:15,410 --> 00:19:16,910
How expensive...

787
00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:18,110
Retainer fees...

788
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:18,710
Are...

789
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:19,590
Actually...

790
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:20,350
Um...

791
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:20,970
Especially...

792
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:22,170
In Canada...

793
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:22,810
Like...

794
00:19:22,810 --> 00:19:25,350

I need...

800
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:29,370
So many...

00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:30,410
Different lawyers...

802
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:30,770
Like...

803
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:31,490
Cause...

804
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:32,710
Each lawyer...

805
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:33,770
Is like...

806
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:34,750
In charge of...

807
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:36,090
Each different thing...

808
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:37,130
Regarding...

809
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:37,450
Like...

810
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:38,950
Specific stuff...

811
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:40,150
Because like...

812
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:40,450
Like...

813
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:41,170
Some lawyers...

814
00:19:41,170 --> 00:19:41,930
Don't do that...

815
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:42,150
Like...

816
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:42,830

Cause it's like...

818
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:44,690
A specialty and stuff...

819
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:45,530
I'm just like...

820
00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:46,330
Oh my god...

821
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:46,710
Like...

822
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:52,430
So you might see...

823
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:53,530
A lot of...

824
00:19:53,530 --> 00:19:54,570
Sponsors...

825
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:55,930
That I'm taking...

826
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:56,570
Um...

827
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:57,010
Normally...

828
00:19:57,010 --> 00:19:57,710
I wouldn't take...

829
00:19:57,710 --> 00:19:59,010
Some of these sponsors...

830
00:19:59,570 --> 00:19:59,890
Um...

831
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:00,630
But like...

832
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:01,190
Now...

833
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:04,170
I don't care...

834
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:05,250
It's more so...

835
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:05,770
Like...

836
00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:06,770
I was like...

837
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:07,110
Okay...

838
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:07,870
This will pay off...

839
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:08,790
Some lawyer fees...

840
00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:12,590

841
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:12,790

844
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:14,710

00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:15,230
By the way...

846
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:15,630
I...

847
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:16,270

848
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:17,370

I've done it once already...

858
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:28,890
I don't need to do it again...

859
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:29,790
I just did that once...

860
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:30,690
For the meme...

861
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:31,130
But...

862
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:31,490
I mean...

863
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:32,310
If they pay me...

864
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:32,650
Like...

865
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:33,270

00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:40,690
That is my minimum...

870
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:42,810
That is literally...

871
00:20:42,810 --> 00:20:44,330
My minimum...

872
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:46,150

878
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:53,790

882
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:00,510
Okay...

885
00:21:00,770 --> 00:21:01,910
I don't know...

886
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:04,250
I don't know where you live...

887
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:04,630
But...

888
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:05,290
$10,000...

889
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:06,550

That's...

00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:14,870
That's a lot...

895
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:16,330
In Canadian money...

896
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:17,190

00:21:19,290 --> 00:21:19,810
A lot...

00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:20,490

00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:24,550
A Canadian...

00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:25,670
Just so you guys know...

907
00:21:25,670 --> 00:21:26,930

908
00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:27,210

909
00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:27,610

911
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:30,390
It's not...

912
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:30,650
It's not...

00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:41,730
It's the same thing as...

914
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:41,750
Yeah...

915
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:41,770
Yeah...

916
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:43,010
Unusual...

917
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:43,090
Or pricey...

918
00:21:43,090 --> 00:21:43,110
And...

919
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:44,210
Yeah...

920
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:45,830
Can be...

921
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:46,530
I don't know...

922
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:48,290
But...

923
00:21:48,290 --> 00:21:48,610
But...

924
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:48,750
I...

925
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:51,470
Can be...

926
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:52,950
It's like...

927
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:53,070

928
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:53,190

929
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:54,090

930
00:21:54,090 --> 00:21:54,130
Like...

931
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:00,270

932
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:00,490

$25好...

934
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:01,290
...and everything.

935
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:11,870
It's been, like, learning about the process and all that, like, um, for myself, has been very interesting, and I do, I really like the experience.

936
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:14,930
Even though, like, I hate that it's super fucking early.

937
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:20,930
Um, I wish it wasn't that early.

938
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:22,210
That's all I wish.

939
00:22:22,410 --> 00:22:26,950
I wish, like, adult meetings did not have to be so early.

940
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:29,930
Um, Spirit, thank you for the 10 gift dishes!

941
00:22:30,170 --> 00:22:31,030
Thank you, thank you!

942
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:33,350
Oh my god!

943
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:47,450
Today, I went to the mall nearby, right after, um, right after, um, uh, uh, the, the, my meetings today.

944
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:49,690
And then, this is so fucked.

945
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:55,010
I showed, like, a photo to a friend, and, like, oh my god.

946
00:22:55,770 --> 00:23:07,450
Um, um, and, like, oh my gosh, it was so fucked, because, uh, cause, like, I didn't know this was a thing!

947
00:23:07,610 --> 00:23:09,310
I didn't know this was a thing, now.

948
00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:11,990
I was, like, that's, like, not great.

949
00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:13,770
But, like, I don't know why people do this.

950
00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:21,630
But, cause I haven't been to an actual mall mall in a long time, because, like, who goes to the mall these days?

951
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:23,970
Uh, but I went to a nearby mall.

952
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:24,990
That was nice.

953
00:23:25,010 --> 00:23:33,030
It was next to, uh, that was, like, um, not next to, but close to where, uh, I had to go for a meeting.

954
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:36,010
And there was this thing that people do.

955
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:38,490
I don't even know if it's, like, something in Canada only.

956
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:43,210
But it was basically, like, um, you get to park your dogs.

957
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:46,130
You get to park your dogs at the mall.

958
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:53,330
But, like, they, like, stuff the dogs in, like, these tiny little, hm, boxes.

959
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:59,270
And then you get an app, and it locks your dog into this tiny little dog house.

960
00:23:59,530 --> 00:24:02,690
And it's, like, gla- like, and the door is, like, see-through.

961
00:24:03,090 --> 00:24:06,550
And then, like, and then you can see the dogs.

962
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:09,210
And I was, like, they looked so sad!

963
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:12,490
I was so, I was so depre- I was, like,

964
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:17,340
I said!

965
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:21,440
I wanna show you guys the picture, cause it was actually really depressing.

966
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,640
I was, like, I was, like, no!

967
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:26,000
Why would you do that?

968
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:27,500
It was so...

969
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:31,080
I was, like, it's literally called Pet Parker.

970
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:33,580
I was, like, what the fuck?

971
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:34,680
It's...

972
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:37,360
Cozy, thank you for the super chat.

973
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:38,320
Thank you, thank you.

974
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:39,500
Oh, no, my lunch.

975
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:41,300
It's... oh, my God.

976
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,300
It's literally... oh, my God.

977
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,680
I was, like, what the fuck?

978
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:51,700
Okay, I like how, um...

979
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:55,920
Okay, so, like, I was, like, that's fucked.

980
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,860
It's literally fucked.

981
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:01,500
Um...

982
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:02,800
Um...

983
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,900
But, yeah, I did not like that.

984
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:07,600
I did not like that.

985
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:09,060
Um...

986
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:11,500
But, it's basically, you...

987
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:13,500
It's, like, a little... little boxing.

988
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:16,520
And then... and then they, like...

989
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:19,360
They just, like, put their dog in a little dog house.

990
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:21,580
And then you... it's, like, you download an app.

991
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,580
And... no, it's also in Brazil.

992
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,880
Also, rest in peace Brazil, by the way.

993
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:26,680
Uh...

994
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,080
Rest in peace Brazil.

995
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:30,200
Because if you guys don't know, um...

996
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,820
What happened in Brazil is that Twitter is gonna...

997
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:34,980
I don't know if it's banned right now.

998
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:39,100
But, like, Twitter is gonna be banned in Brazil.

999
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:40,260
Um...

1000
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,080
Because there was a fight.

1001
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:44,440
There was a...

1002
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:46,720
There... there was a fight.

1003
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:53,520
Between... you know... between...

1004
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:57,800
Yeah.

1005
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:58,260
Is...

1006
00:25:58,260 --> 00:25:59,180
Do people...

1007
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:00,820
Are people still able to access...

1008
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:03,300
Are people still able to access, um...

1009
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:03,900
Twitter?

1010
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,960
They have less than 24 hours?

1011
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:08,360
You know what I thought was extra fucked?

1012
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:09,340
Um...

1013
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:11,020
The fact that, like...

1014
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:13,780
Um...

1015
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:14,760
Um...

1016
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,820
The fact that, like...

1017
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:17,400
Uh...

1018
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:20,120
Right before the Twitter ban...

1019
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:23,180
Brazilian Miku Hatsune was super...

1020
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:24,260
Was, like...

1021
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:24,800
Um...

1022
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,380
Was trending on Twitter.

1023
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:28,560
Like, it went viral in Twitter.

1024
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:31,920
And then, right after Brazilian Miku...

1025
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:32,880
Um...

1026
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,320
They decided to ban Twitter.

1027
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:36,060
And I was like, that is so fucked.

1028
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:37,680
That is really...

1029
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:42,320
Like...

1030
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,080
I was just like...

1031
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,040
Oh my god!

1032
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:49,800
How do you just suddenly ban Twitter right after that?

1033
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:52,200
Right after Brazilian Miku...

1034
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,760
This goes against...

1035
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:56,700
This goes against Miku's ideals.

1036
00:26:57,420 --> 00:27:01,540
That timing is actually so messed up.

1037
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:04,460
Miku killed Twitter in Brazil.

1038
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:06,680
Leela was like, no.

1039
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:07,780
Nope.

1040
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,660
That's so messed up.

1041
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:10,780
Um...

1042
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:12,400
But, yeah.

1043
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:14,160
I thought that was actually...

1044
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,220
Uh...

1045
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:15,740
I...

1046
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:16,940
That was actually crazy.

1047
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:20,720
Brazilian Miku did nothing wrong.

1048
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:21,960
Um...

1049
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:22,920
But, yeah.

1050
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:23,640
Uh...

1051
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:23,740
I...

1052
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:25,120
I can't believe it.

1053
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:27,420
Twitter is going to be gone in the entire country.

1054
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:28,700
Uh...

1055
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:29,760
Before TikTok.

1056
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:33,100
Before the TikTok ban in America.

1057
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:35,780
Like, we lose Twitter for Brazil.

1058
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:37,180
Like...

1059
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:41,460
The fact that, like, Brazil loses the social media before America.

1060
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,720
Brazilian Miku...

1061
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,120
You know, I...

1062
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:50,340
Honestly, I thought TikTok was going to go first.

1063
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:51,420
But, like, no.

1064
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,220
Instead...

1065
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:53,240
Out of nowhere...

1066
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,600
Out of nowhere...

1067
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:55,040
Like...

1068
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:55,480
Um...

1069
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:56,620
Brazil...

1070
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:57,860
With the steel chair...

1071
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:58,560
Was like...

1072
00:27:58,560 --> 00:27:59,200
At Elon...

1073
00:27:59,200 --> 00:27:59,640
Was like...

1074
00:27:59,640 --> 00:27:59,820
No.

1075
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:01,920
No more Twitter in Brazil.

1076
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:04,560
Um...

1077
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:07,980
When it hits his wallet, Elon would totally go back crying for forgiveness.

1078
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:09,380
No, he won't.

1079
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,300
He won't.

1080
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:12,820
He...

1081
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:13,920
This man has...

1082
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:18,000
This man bought Twitter because of his ego hurt.

1083
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:20,660
Guys...

1084
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:21,600
Guys...

1085
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,200
Do you not...

1086
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:23,340
Do you not remember why...

1087
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,720
Elon Musk bought Twitter?

1088
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:27,300
Like...

1089
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:28,860
And...

1090
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:29,900
By the way...

1091
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:30,380
Like...

1092
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:30,880
He got...

1093
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,520
He definitely got scammed.

1094
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:34,760
Because...

1095
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:35,760
He got...

1096
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,840
He got sold for way...

1097
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,060
Way too much.

1098
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:40,320
Um...

1099
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:42,340
But...

1100
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:43,220
Uh...

1101
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:43,920
Ego...

1102
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:44,300
Yeah...

1103
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:44,680
He...

1104
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,080
Literally, his ego was hurt.

1105
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:47,460
And that's why he bought Twitter.

1106
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:48,340
Because he...

1107
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:50,160
Twitter was making fun of him.

1108
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:50,580
And then...

1109
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:51,660
Elon was like...

1110
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:52,880
Was like...

1111
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,620
I love Twitter too much.

1112
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,700
Just quit using it.

1113
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:56,760
I will buy Twitter.

1114
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:01,360
So no one will ever hurt my ego again on the internet.

1115
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:05,500
If I ban everybody that hurts my ego...

1116
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:09,260
Then I'll be unstoppable.

1117
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:10,620
Uh...

1118
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:12,000
Hunter, thank you for the super chat.

1119
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:12,380
Thank you.

1120
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:12,920
Thank you.

1121
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:16,560
Imagine that because of this, the next world superpower becomes Brazil.

1122
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:18,100
Because of lack of Twitter.

1123
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:19,120
Thank you for the super chat.

1124
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:19,560
Thank you.

1125
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:20,180
Thank you.

1126
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:20,560
Thank you.

1127
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:20,820
Thank you for the super chat.

1128
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:21,260
Oh my god.

1129
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,320
Speaking of Elon...

1130
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:25,400
I saw the wildest...

1131
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:26,940
Wildest tw...

1132
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:27,340
Like...

1133
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:30,780
I saw the wildest tweet about him.

1134
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:32,560
Um..

1135
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:33,360
But like...

1136
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:34,500
There is like a bot...

1137
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:35,800
That follows...

1138
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:36,100
Like...

1139
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:38,000
That tracks who he follows...

1140
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:38,400
And stuff.

1141
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:39,860
And who he unfollows.

1142
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:40,560
And then...

1143
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:42,080
One of the unfollows...

1144
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:42,860
Was that...

1145
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:43,700
Like...

1146
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:44,140
Like...

1147
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:46,020
Women that look like grimes.

1148
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,400
Who was his ex-wife.

1149
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:49,980
So he unfollowed a Twitter account.

1150
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:50,540
But...

1151
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:54,200
That, like, tweeted about women that looked like his ex-wife.

1152
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,300
And I was like, Jesus Christ!

1153
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,740
Well, at least he's finally over her.

1154
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:02,960
Like, at least he's finally moved on.

1155
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:07,240
You guys didn't know that?

1156
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:10,320
I thought that was the craziest shit.

1157
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:14,160
I was like, this has to be satire.

1158
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:15,860
There's no way.

1159
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:19,660
Like, there's no fucking way.

1160
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:22,200
Oh, my God.

1161
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:26,060
Oh, my God.

1162
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,980
I was like, there's no fucking way that's real.

1163
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:30,400
But there was no...

1164
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:34,460
There was no, like, what's the word?

1165
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:39,080
You know, like, those, like, Twitter notes or whatever?

1166
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:41,920
It didn't show up.

1167
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:43,340
So I was like, oh, my God, it's real.

1168
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:45,520
I was like...

1169
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:48,780
There's no fact check thing.

1170
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:49,640
There's no fact check thing.

1171
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:50,040
It didn't show up.

1172
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:52,360
I was like, oh, my God, it's fucking real.

1173
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,920
Yeah, the community notes.

1174
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:04,220
I was waiting for the community notes, but it never showed up.

1175
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:06,460
It never fucking showed up.

1176
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:13,360
This probably... Oh, no, 100%.

1177
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:14,540
You guys know why he...

1178
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:17,880
Like, the private likes came after because he, like, liked...

1179
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,640
I think he liked some really weird shit.

1180
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:22,460
And people were like, bro, what the fuck?

1181
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,440
I don't remember what it was.

1182
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:29,900
But, like, I remember the reason why he private likes because he was liking some really fucking weird shit.

1183
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:30,840
So...

1184
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:36,700
He did not like that.

1185
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:39,760
Read Shadow Legends.

1186
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:40,880
Thank you for the super chat.

1187
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:41,300
Thank you.

1188
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:42,020
Thank you.

1189
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:43,940
Oh, my gosh.

1190
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:44,700
Read Shadow Legends.

1191
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:45,540
That's not 10k.

1192
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:46,220
No, I'm joking.

1193
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:47,580
I'm joking.

1194
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:48,880
And...

1195
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:50,900
When will we be free?

1196
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:52,100
When will...

1197
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:53,500
Honestly, like...

1198
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:58,720
As someone that doesn't really use a lot of social media...

1199
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:01,320
Well, I do...

1200
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:02,940
I do and I don't.

1201
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:04,980
I do and I don't.

1202
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:05,560
Like, I don't...

1203
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:09,700
You guys know that I don't really tweet a lot in general or, like, reply to many things.

1204
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:12,580
Because, like...

1205
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:17,280
Social media, like, overwhelms me a lot when I have to be, like...

1206
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:19,000
I guess, like, social.

1207
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:28,220
Before I just like to retweet funny memes.

1208
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:29,920
That's really it.

1209
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:37,840
I just like to retweet funny hahas before being a Vtuber.

1210
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:43,580
But, now, obviously, I have to be social because I'm a content creator.

1211
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:46,120
I have to be chronically online.

1212
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:48,320
But I do enjoy.

1213
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,760
I do enjoy, like, seeing, like, the fan.

1214
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:55,500
The fan art, the cosplays and everything.

1215
00:32:56,560 --> 00:33:00,440
It is very rare for me to interact in general.

1216
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:04,100
Because sometimes I'm like, I don't know what to say.

1217
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:04,740
Like...

1218
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:08,740
I'm just like, I don't know what to say.

1219
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:11,720
Like, oh my gosh, I don't know what to say.

1220
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:15,200
I love lurking.

1221
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:18,440
I love lurking in general.

1222
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:22,440
I'm just really bad at the interacting part.

1223
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:28,860
When I see other vtubers and other content creators replying to almost everything.

1224
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,580
I'm just like, how do they do that?

1225
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:34,060
How do they...

1226
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:38,860
Also, how the fuck do they find the time to do that too?

1227
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:41,680
I'm barely surviving right now.

1228
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:44,000
I'm like, how do you find the time to do that?

1229
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,220
But I do see it.

1230
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:48,600
I see everything.

1231
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:49,680
I see everything.

1232
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:52,440
I'm just really bad at the interacting part.

1233
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:55,700
I'm just very bad at it.

1234
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:58,260
Thank you for the super chat.

1235
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,200
Thank you, thank you.

1236
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:01,700
Oh yeah, that's funny.

1237
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:03,640
I remember that.

1238
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:04,460
There was like...

1239
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:06,080
I don't know if you guys remember this.

1240
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:11,180
I don't know if you remember this.

1241
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:14,140
But at one point, there was like a twitter account.

1242
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:17,680
That tracks his private jets movement.

1243
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:18,200
That tracks his private jets movement.

1244
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:19,600
Because he uses the plane.

1245
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:22,400
Almost as much as Taylor Swift does.

1246
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:24,560
Oh no, the Swifties are gonna get it.

1247
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,840
Like, are gonna get me now.

1248
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:29,860
Oh no, Toki's gonna get cancelled by the Swifties.

1249
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:35,000
For calling out Taylor Swift and her insane use of the private jet.

1250
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:40,820
Toki, no!

1251
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:45,580
I mean, it's true.

1252
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:46,180
Like...

1253
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:49,180
I mean...

1254
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:51,720
I mean like...

1255
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:54,060
You're gonna deny that?

1256
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:54,760
Like...

1257
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:56,660
You're gonna...

1258
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:59,200
Okay, like I like her music.

1259
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:00,320
But like...

1260
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:03,580
She does not have to use the jet plane.

1261
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:04,820
For those who don't know.

1262
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:08,660
Taylor Swift is very well known.

1263
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:11,280
For using her private jet.

1264
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:11,880
For using her private jet.

1265
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:12,620
To like travel.

1266
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,220
Very small distances.

1267
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:17,660
And by very small distances...

1268
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,300
I mean...

1269
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:21,240
Something that could be a...

1270
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:23,080
30 minute car ride.

1271
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:25,100
Like, that's how...

1272
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:27,360
And then she does it...

1273
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:29,040
All the time.

1274
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:31,180
She does it all...

1275
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:33,640
Yes, she flew...

1276
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:35,040
Once within...

1277
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,540
The same city.

1278
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,080
And I'm like...

1279
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:40,760
Okay, I don't understand this.

1280
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:42,460
Because I don't have a fear of flying.

1281
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:43,900
But like...

1282
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:47,080
You know...

1283
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:49,560
That thought in the back of my head.

1284
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:51,440
If you fly too much.

1285
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:53,260
You know when you're flying too much.

1286
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:54,060
And you're like...

1287
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:56,900
That raises the percentage.

1288
00:35:57,340 --> 00:35:57,760
Like...

1289
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:02,020
It's a fucked up thought to have.

1290
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:03,160
But this is why I don't...

1291
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:05,480
That's why I'm like...

1292
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:06,920
How the fuck do you...

1293
00:36:07,350 --> 00:36:07,660
Like...

1294
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:09,980
I don't understand.

1295
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:12,940
I fly a lot too.

1296
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:13,880
But like...

1297
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:16,120
I'll be like...

1298
00:36:17,310 --> 00:36:19,240
That raises the percentage.

1299
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,260
I mean...

1300
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:31,380
So...

1301
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:33,260
It's safer than...

1302
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:34,640
Don't fly.

1303
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:35,580
I don't know.

1304
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:41,020
Well, it's just because there's more...

1305
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:42,960
Okay, the reason why is because there's more...

1306
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:45,080
Fucking cars than there is like...

1307
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:45,640
Planes.

1308
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:46,620
Planes are like...

1309
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:47,720
There's just like...

1310
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:49,300
There's so much...

1311
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:50,580
So many cars.

1312
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:50,960
Okay.

1313
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:52,840
I don't remember which...

1314
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:55,300
I don't remember which...

1315
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:57,880
Country it was.

1316
00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:00,280
But I remember like...

1317
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,800
At one point...

1318
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,500
It was just too many cars.

1319
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,540
That they had to like...

1320
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:08,280
Do a lottery for cars.

1321
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,900
Because it was like...

1322
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:11,760
They were trying to get down the pollution.

1323
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:14,420
And also there was too many cars.

1324
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:17,140
That traffic jams was too...

1325
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:17,640
Like it was...

1326
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:19,160
Traffic jams were so bad.

1327
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:21,240
And then there was like...

1328
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:23,740
They wanted to try to get rid...

1329
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:25,120
Like lower the air pollution.

1330
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:26,380
So then like...

1331
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:27,800
Cars became a lottery.

1332
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:30,160
And because there was too many cars.

1333
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:32,120
There were literally too many cars.

1334
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:35,200
And oh yeah, yeah.

1335
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:35,920
And then like...

1336
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,920
It's like an Asia thing too.

1337
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,800
Where like everyone has a car.

1338
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:41,720
Type deal.

1339
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,120
I remember like...

1340
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:45,880
It was like everyone has a car.

1341
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:46,480
Basically.

1342
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:48,540
It's not about like...

1343
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:51,300
The number one thing to own is a car.

1344
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,700
Like that's the number one thing to own.

1345
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:56,220
So that's what I'm saying.

1346
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:57,880
That's why the percentage is up.

1347
00:37:57,940 --> 00:37:58,700
Because there's a lot.

1348
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,380
I'm glad that my work is at home.

1349
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:07,560
I don't think...

1350
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:10,580
I'm really happy that I get to work at home.

1351
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,940
And that I live in an area...

1352
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:13,880
Where...

1353
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,860
I live in an area...

1354
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:18,760
Where I don't have to worry about driving.

1355
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:20,620
Because everything is just...

1356
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:21,500
Conveniently there.

1357
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:23,640
Or like I'm next to public transport.

1358
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:26,180
Like if I have to...

1359
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:27,880
Or like I just take Uber.

1360
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:31,020
But I try to avoid it.

1361
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:32,140
I try to avoid taking Uber.

1362
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:33,360
Because it's so fucking expensive.

1363
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,340
I'm happy to have Uber.

1364
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:36,900
But like...

1365
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,420
I try to avoid taking Uber.

1366
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:41,940
Because it's so expensive.

1367
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:43,400
Yes I can drive.

1368
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:44,620
I've talked about this before.

1369
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:47,600
But I do have a license.

1370
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:50,820
I just haven't driven a car in like...

1371
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:52,300
8 plus years.

1372
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:53,160
I don't even...

1373
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:55,180
I keep saying these numbers randomly.

1374
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:57,740
It could be 6, it could be 7, it could be 8.

1375
00:38:57,980 --> 00:38:59,220
I just like...

1376
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:01,500
I feel like I have to keep raising the numbers.

1377
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:05,280
Because I don't remember how long it's been since I last drove.

1378
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:07,280
Like I got my driver's license.

1379
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:08,600
And then I stopped.

1380
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:09,700
And then I stopped driving.

1381
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:11,040
That's literally it.

1382
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:12,080
Um...

1383
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:14,960
Neppers, thank you for the super chat.

1384
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:15,840
Thank you, thank you.

1385
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:19,820
As somebody who lives in a city with a minimum 1 hour drive time anywhere.

1386
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,600
During my shower, I'd fly.

1387
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:23,560
If I was rich enough.

1388
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:24,900
Thank you.

1389
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:27,590
Thank you.

1390
00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:31,990
I just...

1391
00:39:31,990 --> 00:39:32,790
I don't know.

1392
00:39:32,970 --> 00:39:33,690
I'm not like...

1393
00:39:33,690 --> 00:39:36,050
I'm not that big of a fan of...

1394
00:39:36,050 --> 00:39:37,070
I think it's because like...

1395
00:39:37,070 --> 00:39:38,310
Growing up...

1396
00:39:38,310 --> 00:39:38,870
I...

1397
00:39:38,870 --> 00:39:42,350
I had to fly a lot.

1398
00:39:42,430 --> 00:39:44,470
Back and forth to like...

1399
00:39:44,890 --> 00:39:46,390
Visit relatives and stuff.

1400
00:39:46,590 --> 00:39:48,310
Or like travel a lot.

1401
00:39:48,530 --> 00:39:51,550
So like I had to fly back and forth a lot.

1402
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:52,330
Growing up.

1403
00:39:52,370 --> 00:39:55,250
I think I had to fly back and forth at least like...

1404
00:39:56,010 --> 00:39:56,510
Uh...

1405
00:39:57,030 --> 00:39:58,730
2 to 4 times a year.

1406
00:39:59,030 --> 00:40:01,590
Since I was like really, really young.

1407
00:40:01,910 --> 00:40:03,450
So because of that...

1408
00:40:03,450 --> 00:40:04,890
I think the moment when I...

1409
00:40:04,890 --> 00:40:07,210
Like got to go back to Canada.

1410
00:40:07,610 --> 00:40:08,210
Um...

1411
00:40:08,210 --> 00:40:10,870
When I got to like finally come back to Canada.

1412
00:40:10,930 --> 00:40:11,810
For university.

1413
00:40:12,290 --> 00:40:14,030
Like I stopped traveling.

1414
00:40:14,290 --> 00:40:15,670
Cause like I never...

1415
00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:17,350
I got like so...

1416
00:40:17,350 --> 00:40:20,030
Like I got so you know...

1417
00:40:21,350 --> 00:40:21,950
Um...

1418
00:40:21,950 --> 00:40:24,030
I guess like tired of it.

1419
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:25,730
I was just so tired of it.

1420
00:40:25,770 --> 00:40:27,170
That I started hating fly...

1421
00:40:27,170 --> 00:40:31,110
Like I hated flying and like commuting back and forth.

1422
00:40:31,170 --> 00:40:31,750
And like...

1423
00:40:31,750 --> 00:40:33,890
Doing those long ass flights.

1424
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:36,690
I just... I can't deal with it anymore.

1425
00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:37,750
Um...

1426
00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:39,150
It's why like...

1427
00:40:39,150 --> 00:40:42,790
When people are like oh do you want to travel around the world?

1428
00:40:42,910 --> 00:40:43,670
I'm like fuck no.

1429
00:40:43,690 --> 00:40:44,650
I just want to stay at home.

1430
00:40:44,970 --> 00:40:46,730
I'm just like...

1431
00:40:46,730 --> 00:40:48,530
I got dragged around...

1432
00:40:48,530 --> 00:40:50,630
The world a lot growing up.

1433
00:40:51,350 --> 00:40:52,390
I'm just...

1434
00:40:52,390 --> 00:40:53,310
I'm just tired.

1435
00:40:55,390 --> 00:40:55,910
Like...

1436
00:40:55,910 --> 00:40:57,810
Don't you want to sightsee?

1437
00:40:57,930 --> 00:40:59,870
Don't you want to see all these places?

1438
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:01,990
No I'll just fucking take...

1439
00:41:03,430 --> 00:41:04,510
I'll just like...

1440
00:41:04,890 --> 00:41:05,290
Watch a video.

1441
00:41:05,510 --> 00:41:06,610
I don't care.

1442
00:41:09,430 --> 00:41:10,690
I want to...

1443
00:41:10,690 --> 00:41:12,410
I want to be at home.

1444
00:41:14,010 --> 00:41:14,690
Like...

1445
00:41:16,650 --> 00:41:17,330
Like...

1446
00:41:17,330 --> 00:41:19,330
I remember like...

1447
00:41:19,330 --> 00:41:19,950
Cause like...

1448
00:41:19,950 --> 00:41:22,230
All those pictures that like...

1449
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:23,990
My family took...

1450
00:41:23,990 --> 00:41:25,930
I never look back at it.

1451
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:27,250
So it's like...

1452
00:41:27,250 --> 00:41:29,150
I remember...

1453
00:41:29,150 --> 00:41:32,170
I remember seeing the leaning tower...

1454
00:41:32,170 --> 00:41:33,970
Like the leaning tower of Pisa...

1455
00:41:33,970 --> 00:41:34,990
And all that shit.

1456
00:41:35,190 --> 00:41:37,090
And all I could think about was like...

1457
00:41:37,090 --> 00:41:39,610
God it was so hot and I was so tired.

1458
00:41:40,930 --> 00:41:41,890
And then...

1459
00:41:41,890 --> 00:41:42,610
I was like...

1460
00:41:42,610 --> 00:41:45,990
I remember going to Venice and all I could remember...

1461
00:41:45,990 --> 00:41:48,370
Like all I could feel and remember...

1462
00:41:48,370 --> 00:41:49,150
Was like...

1463
00:41:49,150 --> 00:41:51,290
God it smells so bad.

1464
00:41:56,110 --> 00:41:57,930
Because I told you guys...

1465
00:41:57,930 --> 00:41:58,510
Like Venice...

1466
00:41:58,510 --> 00:42:00,650
The water is not the best.

1467
00:42:00,850 --> 00:42:01,930
Like the water.

1468
00:42:03,390 --> 00:42:04,970
And I'll be like...

1469
00:42:04,970 --> 00:42:05,630
It was like...

1470
00:42:05,630 --> 00:42:08,130
I remember when I was at Venice...

1471
00:42:08,130 --> 00:42:09,110
I was just like...

1472
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:11,430
It's so crowded and like...

1473
00:42:11,430 --> 00:42:13,290
It's so...

1474
00:42:14,450 --> 00:42:16,010
Crowded and...

1475
00:42:16,010 --> 00:42:18,190
I was just...

1476
00:42:18,190 --> 00:42:19,950
It was super crowded...

1477
00:42:20,150 --> 00:42:21,830
And long lines...

1478
00:42:22,150 --> 00:42:23,810
For like touristy stuff.

1479
00:42:24,310 --> 00:42:25,130
And...

1480
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:27,930
And I wasn't...

1481
00:42:28,510 --> 00:42:31,190
I didn't have that great of a time.

1482
00:42:31,410 --> 00:42:32,690
And then I remember in Paris...

1483
00:42:32,690 --> 00:42:33,750
I don't wanna talk...

1484
00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:34,930
We don't talk about Paris.

1485
00:42:35,150 --> 00:42:35,630
Like...

1486
00:42:38,670 --> 00:42:40,930
We all know what happens when...

1487
00:42:41,810 --> 00:42:42,290
Like...

1488
00:42:42,790 --> 00:42:44,710
Tourists go to Paris...

1489
00:42:45,290 --> 00:42:47,230
And then they get like culture shock.

1490
00:42:47,510 --> 00:42:48,430
Because they're like...

1491
00:42:48,430 --> 00:42:51,050
Wait Paris isn't what it's like in the movies?

1492
00:42:51,430 --> 00:42:52,430
And then like...

1493
00:42:52,430 --> 00:42:54,090
I know there's like an actual...

1494
00:42:54,090 --> 00:42:56,810
Like syndrome that you can get from it.

1495
00:42:58,510 --> 00:42:59,170
Like the whole culture shock.

1496
00:42:59,370 --> 00:43:01,310
Over like how Paris...

1497
00:43:01,310 --> 00:43:02,430
Yeah the Paris syndrome.

1498
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:03,710
So like...

1499
00:43:03,710 --> 00:43:05,710
There's like a thing called the Paris syndrome.

1500
00:43:05,910 --> 00:43:09,230
Where people have to get therapy right after going to Paris.

1501
00:43:09,490 --> 00:43:10,930
Because they get so depressed.

1502
00:43:11,310 --> 00:43:12,330
That like...

1503
00:43:12,330 --> 00:43:16,950
Paris isn't what it was like in the movies and TV shows.

1504
00:43:17,210 --> 00:43:17,810
So like...

1505
00:43:17,810 --> 00:43:20,130
People have to get therapy right after going to Paris.

1506
00:43:20,490 --> 00:43:21,330
So yeah...

1507
00:43:21,330 --> 00:43:22,010
No they're right.

1508
00:43:22,150 --> 00:43:22,810
Like it's...

1509
00:43:25,290 --> 00:43:26,230
And then...

1510
00:43:28,510 --> 00:43:30,230
The worst part is that...

1511
00:43:30,230 --> 00:43:32,230
I had to go through like...

1512
00:43:32,230 --> 00:43:33,010
Um...

1513
00:43:33,650 --> 00:43:36,310
I had to go through like...

1514
00:43:36,310 --> 00:43:37,330
Tour guides.

1515
00:43:37,710 --> 00:43:38,550
I hate tours.

1516
00:43:38,730 --> 00:43:41,290
I know they're like...

1517
00:43:41,290 --> 00:43:44,490
We're just trying to make sure you have the most legit experience...

1518
00:43:44,490 --> 00:43:46,290
When it comes to visiting these countries.

1519
00:43:46,690 --> 00:43:48,190
But like it's such a scam.

1520
00:43:48,410 --> 00:43:49,090
I feel like...

1521
00:43:49,090 --> 00:43:51,670
They literally take you to places...

1522
00:43:52,270 --> 00:43:54,310
That like overcharge you and everything.

1523
00:43:54,630 --> 00:43:56,530
Because it's like they take you to the tourist traps.

1524
00:43:56,530 --> 00:43:57,950
And then to get like...

1525
00:43:57,950 --> 00:43:59,690
Commission fees and all that shit.

1526
00:43:59,910 --> 00:44:00,890
And then like...

1527
00:44:00,890 --> 00:44:02,470
And then you have to wait for everybody.

1528
00:44:02,870 --> 00:44:04,450
Because it's a tour group.

1529
00:44:04,610 --> 00:44:06,750
So you have to wait for everybody.

1530
00:44:07,390 --> 00:44:10,410
And I'm like...

1531
00:44:10,410 --> 00:44:11,910
I just wanna be home.

1532
00:44:16,510 --> 00:44:17,710
Oh my god.

1533
00:44:17,830 --> 00:44:20,150
And this is why I don't like traveling anymore.

1534
00:44:20,710 --> 00:44:21,250
Um...

1535
00:44:21,250 --> 00:44:24,790
I'm just very...

1536
00:44:24,790 --> 00:44:26,670
I like just being...

1537
00:44:26,670 --> 00:44:27,510
I just like...

1538
00:44:27,510 --> 00:44:30,930
The experience I like from traveling...

1539
00:44:30,930 --> 00:44:31,430
Food.

1540
00:44:32,590 --> 00:44:34,130
It's really just food.

1541
00:44:39,030 --> 00:44:40,270
Like food...

1542
00:44:40,270 --> 00:44:42,090
And yeah that's it.

1543
00:44:43,430 --> 00:44:44,350
That's it.

1544
00:44:44,650 --> 00:44:45,530
Like I guess like...

1545
00:44:45,530 --> 00:44:48,030
Amusement parks and like cute stuff.

1546
00:44:48,230 --> 00:44:49,810
Like you know like shopping.

1547
00:44:50,070 --> 00:44:52,110
I like shopping for cute things.

1548
00:44:52,190 --> 00:44:53,430
And exploring malls.

1549
00:44:54,790 --> 00:44:56,370
Or like indoors you know.

1550
00:44:56,530 --> 00:44:57,410
Like I'm just thinking about Japan.

1551
00:44:57,550 --> 00:45:00,870
Japan I didn't do any really sightseeing.

1552
00:45:01,230 --> 00:45:02,730
Because like you know.

1553
00:45:02,750 --> 00:45:05,070
Like I said I'm not really into the whole sightseeing part.

1554
00:45:05,310 --> 00:45:06,750
I like to shop.

1555
00:45:06,970 --> 00:45:08,670
Like buying like cute stuff.

1556
00:45:08,750 --> 00:45:09,750
Going to amusement parks.

1557
00:45:09,850 --> 00:45:11,790
Going to like Studio Ghibli things.

1558
00:45:12,070 --> 00:45:13,870
Cause I was like oh so cute.

1559
00:45:14,050 --> 00:45:15,410
And then shopping after that.

1560
00:45:15,470 --> 00:45:17,750
Buying like Studio Ghibli stuff.

1561
00:45:17,950 --> 00:45:19,830
Or like going to amusement parks and everything.

1562
00:45:20,310 --> 00:45:21,470
Like that's fun.

1563
00:45:21,690 --> 00:45:22,930
That's fun for me.

1564
00:45:24,810 --> 00:45:28,690
I'm not like into the whole like sightseeing stuff in general.

1565
00:45:28,870 --> 00:45:31,710
I remember like when I went to like Korea with my friend.

1566
00:45:31,810 --> 00:45:32,710
Like we didn't really...

1567
00:45:33,290 --> 00:45:35,250
We went to visit one temple.

1568
00:45:35,590 --> 00:45:36,930
But that was like the one temple.

1569
00:45:37,570 --> 00:45:38,410
Which was like...

1570
00:45:38,410 --> 00:45:39,770
This was a long time ago.

1571
00:45:39,870 --> 00:45:41,330
But in Seoul.

1572
00:45:41,450 --> 00:45:45,050
Where it was like the guy who invented the Korean alphabet.

1573
00:45:45,750 --> 00:45:48,410
So like that was like the one sightseeing thing I did.

1574
00:45:48,670 --> 00:45:50,690
And other than that we were just like shopping.

1575
00:45:50,750 --> 00:45:52,510
And going to like amusement parks.

1576
00:45:52,510 --> 00:45:53,970
And like food.

1577
00:45:54,390 --> 00:45:57,250
Like that's basically it.

1578
00:45:57,470 --> 00:45:58,510
Like I just...

1579
00:45:58,510 --> 00:45:59,770
That's like my...

1580
00:45:59,770 --> 00:46:02,390
My definition of a good time.

1581
00:46:06,550 --> 00:46:07,970
And but yeah.

1582
00:46:08,090 --> 00:46:09,230
Not really...

1583
00:46:09,230 --> 00:46:11,290
I don't say like a material girl.

1584
00:46:11,490 --> 00:46:13,830
Like I don't buy like clothes or anything.

1585
00:46:14,490 --> 00:46:16,230
I just buy like...

1586
00:46:16,230 --> 00:46:17,290
Oh it's cute you know.

1587
00:46:17,390 --> 00:46:19,830
Like I'll be like oh this will look really good.

1588
00:46:19,830 --> 00:46:21,390
At my apartment.

1589
00:46:21,470 --> 00:46:22,870
Or like oh this looks so cute.

1590
00:46:24,150 --> 00:46:26,090
Or like some knick knacks.

1591
00:46:26,150 --> 00:46:26,930
And stuff like that.

1592
00:46:27,050 --> 00:46:28,410
Like I don't really buy...

1593
00:46:28,950 --> 00:46:31,210
I used to have like...

1594
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:33,750
I think this is like an Asian thing too.

1595
00:46:34,050 --> 00:46:35,830
Like when I...

1596
00:46:35,830 --> 00:46:37,410
When I was back.

1597
00:46:37,470 --> 00:46:38,290
Lived in Asia.

1598
00:46:39,490 --> 00:46:41,270
It was like a status thing.

1599
00:46:41,390 --> 00:46:43,210
To have like designer brands.

1600
00:46:43,390 --> 00:46:44,330
And stuff like that.

1601
00:46:44,530 --> 00:46:47,150
Because it was like to let people know that yeah.

1602
00:46:47,410 --> 00:46:48,950
Like I can...

1603
00:46:49,830 --> 00:46:50,750
We have...

1604
00:46:50,750 --> 00:46:53,070
So like I learned about like...

1605
00:46:53,070 --> 00:46:54,410
Louis Vuitton.

1606
00:46:54,470 --> 00:46:56,350
Like Gucci and stuff like that.

1607
00:46:56,430 --> 00:46:57,090
But I didn't care.

1608
00:46:57,310 --> 00:46:57,890
I didn't care.

1609
00:47:01,070 --> 00:47:06,370
I didn't really care.

1610
00:47:07,890 --> 00:47:11,010
I just had to have like...

1611
00:47:12,030 --> 00:47:13,650
Like I had to have...

1612
00:47:13,650 --> 00:47:15,570
Like some form of like...

1613
00:47:15,570 --> 00:47:16,790
I had to have at least...

1614
00:47:16,790 --> 00:47:19,610
Some form of a designer brand thing.

1615
00:47:19,830 --> 00:47:21,590
Because like it was to like...

1616
00:47:21,590 --> 00:47:23,530
It was like to upstage like...

1617
00:47:23,530 --> 00:47:24,450
Um...

1618
00:47:24,450 --> 00:47:27,590
Like my aunties and uncles and stuff.

1619
00:47:27,790 --> 00:47:29,550
So like they'll be like...

1620
00:47:29,550 --> 00:47:30,850
Yeah she has...

1621
00:47:30,850 --> 00:47:34,190
Yeah our daughter has a Louis Vuitton wallet.

1622
00:47:34,290 --> 00:47:35,750
I still have a Louis Vuitton wallet.

1623
00:47:35,950 --> 00:47:38,090
That was given to me.

1624
00:47:38,150 --> 00:47:39,810
Like 10 years ago.

1625
00:47:40,030 --> 00:47:41,490
Like I still use it.

1626
00:47:46,740 --> 00:47:48,100
Because I...

1627
00:47:48,100 --> 00:47:50,720
I don't care that much.

1628
00:47:50,820 --> 00:47:51,280
Like...

1629
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:56,440
Um...

1630
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:56,840
Um...

1631
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:58,640
Yeah it was like...

1632
00:47:58,640 --> 00:47:59,540
It was like...

1633
00:47:59,540 --> 00:48:00,120
It was like...

1634
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:03,820
I guess like Asian flexing and stuff.

1635
00:48:04,820 --> 00:48:05,620
Um...

1636
00:48:06,380 --> 00:48:07,100
I don't...

1637
00:48:07,100 --> 00:48:10,360
I don't buy brand name stuff.

1638
00:48:10,980 --> 00:48:12,480
I literally...

1639
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:14,740
My outfits are mostly just like...

1640
00:48:14,740 --> 00:48:16,520
Cute sweaters and...

1641
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:17,860
I usually...

1642
00:48:17,860 --> 00:48:21,020
Nowadays most of the clothes I buy...

1643
00:48:21,020 --> 00:48:22,040
Are...

1644
00:48:22,540 --> 00:48:24,520
Most of the clothes I buy...

1645
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:25,460
Are like...

1646
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:27,600
Stuff I buy from like...

1647
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:29,380
I guess like artist alley.

1648
00:48:30,260 --> 00:48:31,440
Because it's really cute.

1649
00:48:31,660 --> 00:48:32,920
Oh my god!

1650
00:48:33,340 --> 00:48:35,640
Like I said yesterday...

1651
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:36,920
When did I went to the fair?

1652
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:37,740
Two days ago?

1653
00:48:37,940 --> 00:48:39,200
I was so happy!

1654
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:42,640
Because two days ago I was wearing my cat sweater.

1655
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:44,460
It was very hot.

1656
00:48:45,820 --> 00:48:46,920
I'm so...

1657
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:49,220
By the way it was very hot.

1658
00:48:49,220 --> 00:48:51,200
I don't like Uniqlo that much.

1659
00:48:51,860 --> 00:48:52,460
Um...

1660
00:48:52,460 --> 00:48:53,920
I don't know.

1661
00:48:54,180 --> 00:48:56,800
I'm not like a huge fan of like...

1662
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:58,120
Uniqlo stuff.

1663
00:48:58,920 --> 00:48:59,520
Um...

1664
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:01,820
Because like I don't really like...

1665
00:49:01,820 --> 00:49:03,500
I don't like wearing just like...

1666
00:49:05,260 --> 00:49:07,320
Graphic t-shirts and stuff like...

1667
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:08,360
I mean like Uniqlo...

1668
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:10,500
I guess there's like other stuff but...

1669
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:11,020
Um...

1670
00:49:11,020 --> 00:49:15,360
I don't really like to wear Uniqlo stuff that often.

1671
00:49:16,260 --> 00:49:16,860
Um...

1672
00:49:16,860 --> 00:49:18,160
But like...

1673
00:49:19,220 --> 00:49:21,000
I was so happy because I was wearing...

1674
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,920
Okay it was really cold in the morning when I went to the fair.

1675
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:24,800
But...

1676
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:26,500
It got hotter so I was like...

1677
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:27,280
I made a mistake.

1678
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:30,180
But...

1679
00:49:30,180 --> 00:49:33,100
It was so cute because...

1680
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:34,840
Um...

1681
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:36,880
It was so cute because like...

1682
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:39,300
I was wearing a really cute sweater.

1683
00:49:39,460 --> 00:49:40,680
Wait let me see if I can find it.

1684
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:42,340
I think I showed you guys the sweater before.

1685
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:43,600
Um...

1686
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:46,320
And like...

1687
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:48,360
Like a group of girls like...

1688
00:49:49,220 --> 00:49:51,000
I was like I love your sweater.

1689
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:52,140
And I was like...

1690
00:49:52,140 --> 00:49:53,600
Oh my god.

1691
00:49:53,820 --> 00:49:57,340
I feel like my day has been made for the entire day.

1692
00:49:57,700 --> 00:49:58,240
Like...

1693
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:01,360
It made me so happy.

1694
00:50:01,780 --> 00:50:03,120
Wait let me see if I can find it.

1695
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:04,380
Um...

1696
00:50:05,060 --> 00:50:05,980
Fuck where...

1697
00:50:05,980 --> 00:50:07,920
I don't even remember what store it was.

1698
00:50:08,940 --> 00:50:09,480
Um...

1699
00:50:10,620 --> 00:50:12,440
Okay let me see.

1700
00:50:13,140 --> 00:50:13,680
Um...

1701
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:16,860
Let me see if I can remember what convention...

1702
00:50:16,860 --> 00:50:18,060
I got it from.

1703
00:50:19,220 --> 00:50:19,360
Fuck okay.

1704
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:24,500
I bought it at an RSLE a long time ago.

1705
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:25,960
So like it's...

1706
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:28,820
So hard for me to remember because it's been a while.

1707
00:50:29,180 --> 00:50:30,640
It's been a while.

1708
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:32,960
I remember I showed it to you guys.

1709
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:34,840
Um...

1710
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:36,100
I remember I...

1711
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:37,980
I showed it to you guys before.

1712
00:50:38,460 --> 00:50:40,200
It's the one with the lots of cats.

1713
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:42,320
It was the one with...

1714
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:45,060
Lots of cats on it too.

1715
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:46,300
But I can't remember.

1716
00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:47,900
I remember I showed it to you guys.

1717
00:50:47,980 --> 00:50:49,720
But I don't remember like...

1718
00:50:50,220 --> 00:50:51,600
Uh what it looked like.

1719
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:52,560
Maybe I'll...

1720
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:55,580
I remember it had like...

1721
00:50:55,580 --> 00:50:57,440
They have a dog version too.

1722
00:50:57,560 --> 00:50:58,980
Which was really cute as well.

1723
00:50:59,700 --> 00:51:00,260
Uh...

1724
00:51:00,260 --> 00:51:02,680
I'm trying to look up artists right now.

1725
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:04,460
Uh...

1726
00:51:04,460 --> 00:51:07,060
I remember I told you guys.

1727
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:09,040
I linked the Instagram and everything.

1728
00:51:09,660 --> 00:51:11,300
Cause I was like it's so cute.

1729
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:12,740
Let's see.

1730
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:14,680
Sweaters.

1731
00:51:15,260 --> 00:51:15,740
Cute.

1732
00:51:17,780 --> 00:51:18,260
Okay.

1733
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:19,600
Wait let me...

1734
00:51:20,260 --> 00:51:22,780
I still have like... I have another sweater that I bought.

1735
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:23,280
Give me a sec.

1736
00:51:23,380 --> 00:51:23,880
I'll be right back.

1737
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:24,820
I'll be right back.

1738
00:51:24,820 --> 00:51:25,680
I'm gonna find...

1739
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:27,420
I have like one of the sweaters package.

1740
00:51:28,380 --> 00:51:29,860
That I haven't opened yet.

1741
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:32,520
Cause like I'm waiting for Gortan to wear it.

1742
00:51:45,590 --> 00:51:46,710
I found it.

1743
00:51:47,130 --> 00:51:48,590
Okay it's called...

1744
00:51:50,070 --> 00:51:50,550
Tanikuma.

1745
00:51:52,730 --> 00:51:53,210
Tanikuma.

1746
00:51:53,490 --> 00:51:53,910
Okay.

1747
00:51:54,570 --> 00:51:54,970
I don't know.

1748
00:51:55,090 --> 00:51:57,490
I really like buying clothes from Artist Alley.

1749
00:51:58,330 --> 00:51:58,770
Um...

1750
00:51:59,390 --> 00:52:02,350
Cause I don't really care about fashion that much in general.

1751
00:52:02,910 --> 00:52:03,350
Uh...

1752
00:52:03,350 --> 00:52:06,510
I like looking at really cute fashion but I don't really care about it.

1753
00:52:06,550 --> 00:52:07,670
I like looking at it.

1754
00:52:07,690 --> 00:52:09,430
I don't like actually...

1755
00:52:09,430 --> 00:52:11,050
I guess I just... I don't know.

1756
00:52:11,150 --> 00:52:12,230
I just don't like actually wear it.

1757
00:52:13,230 --> 00:52:16,710
But I like wearing cute stuff made by other local artists.

1758
00:52:17,410 --> 00:52:17,850
Uh...

1759
00:52:17,850 --> 00:52:18,610
Oh it's this one.

1760
00:52:18,830 --> 00:52:21,230
These are the clothes that I saw.

1761
00:52:21,490 --> 00:52:22,630
They're so cute.

1762
00:52:22,630 --> 00:52:23,670
And...

1763
00:52:23,670 --> 00:52:24,870
Oh I was wearing this one!

1764
00:52:25,230 --> 00:52:25,510
Yeah!

1765
00:52:25,670 --> 00:52:26,950
This is the one I was wearing.

1766
00:52:27,730 --> 00:52:29,190
This is the one I was wearing.

1767
00:52:29,430 --> 00:52:30,510
And the people were like...

1768
00:52:30,510 --> 00:52:32,090
The group of girls.

1769
00:52:32,350 --> 00:52:34,170
Like group of like... I don't know.

1770
00:52:34,230 --> 00:52:35,990
College students I think.

1771
00:52:36,170 --> 00:52:36,970
I think they were college...

1772
00:52:36,970 --> 00:52:39,410
They're definitely young adults.

1773
00:52:39,730 --> 00:52:40,830
Or I don't know.

1774
00:52:41,010 --> 00:52:42,930
I can't tell anymore.

1775
00:52:43,390 --> 00:52:45,090
Like sometimes like...

1776
00:52:45,090 --> 00:52:48,610
They look much older than I expected.

1777
00:52:52,110 --> 00:52:54,110
But this is the sweater I had on.

1778
00:52:54,370 --> 00:52:55,590
And people were like...

1779
00:52:55,590 --> 00:52:56,310
That's so cute!

1780
00:52:56,550 --> 00:52:57,070
And I was like...

1781
00:52:57,070 --> 00:52:57,650
Yippee!

1782
00:53:00,210 --> 00:53:01,170

1792
00:53:18,610 --> 00:53:19,670
It's a capybara.

1793
00:53:19,850 --> 00:53:20,790
Give me a sec.

1794
00:53:21,690 --> 00:53:22,850
It's a capybara.

1795
00:53:23,250 --> 00:53:25,270
It's a capybara shirt and it's so cute.

1796
00:53:25,410 --> 00:53:26,390
But I don't remember what it's called.

00:53:26,590 --> 00:53:27,870

1802
00:53:38,510 --> 00:53:40,430
Halfway off to see the label and everything.

1803
00:53:41,730 --> 00:53:42,130

1809
00:53:50,390 --> 00:53:51,430
No that's not her.

1810
00:53:51,730 --> 00:53:53,890

00:53:57,530 --> 00:53:58,450
Did I read it wrong?

1814
00:53:58,490 --> 00:53:59,830
I'm reading it upside down.

1815
00:54:01,750 --> 00:54:02,230
Um...

1816
00:54:04,010 --> 00:54:04,930

1817
00:54:05,210 --> 00:54:06,070

But I don't remember what the others were.

1853
00:55:18,970 --> 00:55:20,030
But I don't know.

1854
00:55:20,170 --> 00:55:22,770
I just like buying clothes from local art...

1855
00:55:22,770 --> 00:55:25,770
From artists at Artist Alley.

1856
00:55:25,930 --> 00:55:26,430
Or like...

1857
00:55:26,430 --> 00:55:28,450
Not just artists from Artist Alley.

00:55:28,590 --> 00:55:33,890
But also I like buying clothes from just like local artists.

1859

And I just think it's cute.

1866

00:56:26,170 --> 00:56:27,390
Sorry for all the guys.

1887
00:56:33,230 --> 00:56:34,190

Speaking of graphic t-shirts.

I own a Dunder Mifflin graphic t-shirt.

1891
00:56:43,450 --> 00:56:46,350
Because I think I was like traveling or something.

1892
00:56:46,510 --> 00:56:47,170
I was traveling.

1893
00:56:47,570 --> 00:56:50,690
And I forgot to pack an extra shirt.

1894
00:56:51,010 --> 00:56:52,330
So I had to like...

1895
00:56:52,330 --> 00:56:53,850
Did you guys know?

1896
00:56:53,970 --> 00:56:56,290
You can like uber eats shirts.

1897
00:56:56,750 --> 00:56:57,550
So like...

1898
00:56:58,350 --> 00:56:59,590
It's so embarrassing.

1899
00:57:00,010 --> 00:57:02,630
Because like I don't like wearing graphic t-shirts.

1900
00:57:02,650 --> 00:57:05,390
Like those types of graphic t-shirts in general.

1901
00:57:06,810 --> 00:57:08,090
Like those types of graphic t-shirts in general.

1902
00:57:08,090 --> 00:57:09,850
Like those types of graphic t-shirts in general.

1903
00:57:09,850 --> 00:57:12,870
Yeah you can uber eats like clothes.

1904
00:57:13,130 --> 00:57:15,350
Like from like Walmart and stuff like that.

1905
00:57:15,530 --> 00:57:17,390
It depends on like what kind of stores are in it.

1906
00:57:17,490 --> 00:57:17,750
It depends on like what kind of stores are in it.

1907
00:57:17,750 --> 00:57:19,710
But like there was a...

1908
00:57:19,710 --> 00:57:22,210
I was like okay I need like a shirt.

1909
00:57:22,410 --> 00:57:23,790
Like I need like an extra shirt.

1910
00:57:24,050 --> 00:57:25,370
So I like...

1911
00:57:26,870 --> 00:57:29,050
Because I was like I don't really want to do laundry.

1912
00:57:29,230 --> 00:57:31,670
So I'm just going to buy another shirt.

1913
00:57:31,810 --> 00:57:32,110
So I'm just going to buy another shirt.

1914
00:57:32,110 --> 00:57:32,670
Since I'm traveling.

1915
00:57:33,030 --> 00:57:35,570
And I was like well I'm going to be coming home anyway.

1916
00:57:35,610 --> 00:57:36,410
Very soon.

1917
00:57:36,630 --> 00:57:38,130
But I need an extra shirt.

1918
00:57:40,010 --> 00:57:41,250
Before I go out.

1919
00:57:41,250 --> 00:57:41,990
For something.

1920
00:57:42,290 --> 00:57:44,830
And like obviously I didn't want to wear like my old clothes.

1921
00:57:44,910 --> 00:57:46,950
Because I was like I'm going home soon anyway.

1922
00:57:47,250 --> 00:57:48,710
So I was like okay I'm just going to uber eats.

1923
00:57:48,930 --> 00:57:50,310
I'm going to uber eats a shirt.

1924
00:57:51,510 --> 00:57:53,490
And I was looking at it.

1925
00:57:53,550 --> 00:57:54,770
And I was so embarrassed.

1926
00:57:55,030 --> 00:57:58,770
Because like all the shirt options they have.

1927
00:57:59,090 --> 00:57:59,790
I was like...

1928
00:57:59,790 --> 00:58:01,150
It was so embarrassed.

1929
00:58:01,410 --> 00:58:02,350
There's a Rick and Morty.

1930
00:58:02,390 --> 00:58:03,110
I was like alright.

1931
00:58:03,370 --> 00:58:05,750
Either I get the Rick and Morty shirt.

1932
00:58:07,790 --> 00:58:08,750
The Jurassic.

1933
00:58:09,850 --> 00:58:10,610
The Rick and Morty shirt.

1934
00:58:10,730 --> 00:58:11,850
Jurassic Park.

1935
00:58:12,550 --> 00:58:13,750
Dunder Mifflin.

1936
00:58:15,530 --> 00:58:16,470
I don't know.

1937
00:58:16,530 --> 00:58:17,890
I was just like oh my gosh.

1938
00:58:18,030 --> 00:58:20,830
I'm too old to wear these types of shirts.

1939
00:58:20,990 --> 00:58:21,550
Like I...

1940
00:58:24,610 --> 00:58:27,010
I was just like oh my god.

1941
00:58:27,150 --> 00:58:28,810
I'm not into this.

1942
00:58:29,430 --> 00:58:31,390
I'm not into this.

1943
00:58:32,070 --> 00:58:33,910
Oh this wasn't even Jurassic Park.

1944
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:35,790
It was Jurassic World too.

1945
00:58:36,130 --> 00:58:38,070
It was like a Jurassic World shirt.

1946
00:58:38,070 --> 00:58:39,370
And then...

1947
00:58:41,230 --> 00:58:43,850
There was a lot more cringe options.

1948
00:58:44,370 --> 00:58:47,130
But like I settled with the Dunder Mifflin.

1949
00:58:47,310 --> 00:58:49,430
The Dunder Mifflin.

1950
00:58:49,470 --> 00:58:51,250
And the Jurassic World shirt.

1951
00:58:51,330 --> 00:58:52,810
I bought two just in case.

1952
00:58:52,890 --> 00:58:54,050
Like one was the emergency.

1953
00:58:55,390 --> 00:58:56,270
And yeah.

1954
00:58:56,630 --> 00:58:58,250
I had to wear...

1955
00:58:58,250 --> 00:58:59,690
I didn't wear the Dunder Mifflin.

1956
00:58:59,830 --> 00:59:00,650
I was like okay.

1957
00:59:01,130 --> 00:59:04,110
If I have to wear either of these in public.

1958
00:59:04,110 --> 00:59:06,710
I will wear the Jurassic World shirt.

1959
00:59:07,010 --> 00:59:08,890
Because at least people would be like.

1960
00:59:09,210 --> 00:59:09,690
Okay.

1961
00:59:14,970 --> 00:59:16,670
The Jurassic World shirt.

1962
00:59:16,830 --> 00:59:18,790
I was like that's the safest option.

1963
00:59:18,850 --> 00:59:19,570
For me.

1964
00:59:19,830 --> 00:59:20,390
I don't know.

1965
00:59:20,470 --> 00:59:23,690
I feel like not a lot of people wear it.

1966
00:59:23,690 --> 00:59:24,130
I don't know.

1967
00:59:24,210 --> 00:59:24,850
Maybe they do.

1968
00:59:24,990 --> 00:59:26,730
Maybe I just don't go outside anymore.

1969
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:30,850
But like I feel like I don't see lots of people wearing these types of shirts.

1970
00:59:31,710 --> 00:59:33,370
Like you know as adults.

1971
00:59:34,110 --> 00:59:35,750
I'm so sorry if you're an adult.

1972
00:59:35,910 --> 00:59:37,670
And you're wearing a Rick and Morty shirt.

1973
00:59:37,790 --> 00:59:38,650
Like I'm really sorry.

1974
00:59:39,030 --> 00:59:41,370
But I feel like.

1975
00:59:41,370 --> 00:59:42,950
I feel like I don't see that.

1976
00:59:44,010 --> 00:59:44,530
Anymore.

1977
00:59:44,810 --> 00:59:48,030
Like maybe like five years ago.

1978
00:59:48,090 --> 00:59:48,570
Yeah.

1979
00:59:48,670 --> 00:59:51,150
But it's definitely not as common.

1980
00:59:52,250 --> 00:59:52,770
Anymore.

1981
00:59:53,050 --> 00:59:55,310
Like I guess like when you're wearing.

1982
00:59:55,510 --> 00:59:57,510
Wearing as like pajamas.

1983
00:59:58,030 --> 01:00:00,710
I usually feel like people wear it more as pajamas now.

1984
01:00:01,390 --> 01:00:02,530
Instead of like.

1985
01:00:02,750 --> 01:00:03,110
Um.

1986
01:00:04,110 --> 01:00:04,550
Out in public.

1987
01:00:08,010 --> 01:00:10,150
Why do you hurt us like.

1988
01:00:10,250 --> 01:00:11,630
I just don't see it as.

1989
01:00:11,710 --> 01:00:12,750
As much anymore.

1990
01:00:13,130 --> 01:00:14,350
I don't see it.

1991
01:00:14,370 --> 01:00:16,990
I wear Fortnite shirts to my university.

1992
01:00:17,290 --> 01:00:18,430
Yeah but when you're in university.

1993
01:00:18,970 --> 01:00:21,190
Everybody like don't care.

1994
01:00:23,790 --> 01:00:25,030
You know what I mean.

1995
01:00:25,370 --> 01:00:26,810
Like when you're in university.

1996
01:00:26,950 --> 01:00:29,130
Nobody cares what they wear at university.

1997
01:00:29,330 --> 01:00:31,630
Because everybody's just trying to survive.

1998
01:00:32,290 --> 01:00:34,490
Everyone's just trying to make it through the day.

1999
01:00:38,170 --> 01:00:38,650
Um.

2000
01:00:39,130 --> 01:00:39,190
Um.

2001
01:00:39,190 --> 01:00:39,310
Um.

2002
01:00:39,630 --> 01:00:40,110
Um.

2003
01:00:40,110 --> 01:00:40,170
Um.

2004
01:00:40,170 --> 01:00:40,210
Um.

2005
01:00:40,570 --> 01:00:41,050
Um.

2006
01:00:42,230 --> 01:00:42,570
Um.

2007
01:00:47,290 --> 01:00:47,770
Um.

2008
01:00:48,450 --> 01:00:50,470
Like people even wear like.

2009
01:00:50,770 --> 01:00:52,430
Pajamas to classes.

2010
01:00:52,690 --> 01:00:54,290
Because they just can't be bothered anymore.

2011
01:00:54,770 --> 01:00:55,570
It's more so.

2012
01:00:55,670 --> 01:00:57,290
Okay Totoro that's fine.

2013
01:00:57,630 --> 01:00:58,030
That's fine.

2014
01:00:58,090 --> 01:01:00,030
It's more of like the normie stuff.

2015
01:01:00,250 --> 01:01:00,650
You know.

2016
01:01:01,530 --> 01:01:04,130
It's more of like the super normie stuff.

2017
01:01:04,250 --> 01:01:05,490
That you don't see anymore.

2018
01:01:05,810 --> 01:01:07,030
Like I know for sure.

2019
01:01:07,070 --> 01:01:08,990
I don't fucking see Dunder Mifflin.

2020
01:01:09,110 --> 01:01:10,630
While walking out in public.

2021
01:01:10,630 --> 01:01:10,890

I saw that once.

2042
01:01:45,550 --> 01:01:46,470
I think at university.

2043
01:01:46,830 --> 01:01:47,910
I saw that.

2044
01:01:48,150 --> 01:01:49,550

Ahego hoodies.

01:02:01,710 --> 01:02:03,490
You see that more in university.

2053
01:02:03,810 --> 01:02:05,150
Than anything else.

2054
01:02:05,410 --> 01:02:07,910
Like you'll catch those in the wild.

2055
01:02:08,050 --> 01:02:08,750
At university.

2056
01:02:10,630 --> 01:02:12,090
Just anywhere else in the world.

2057
01:02:12,250 --> 01:02:12,710
That's like.

2058
01:02:12,790 --> 01:02:13,450
I don't know why.

2059
01:02:13,690 --> 01:02:15,190
But it's like a university outfit.

2060
01:02:15,430 --> 01:02:17,550
And I have no idea why it is.

2061
01:02:17,630 --> 01:02:19,250
I don't know how it like.

2062
01:02:19,310 --> 01:02:20,550
Has got to that point.

2063
01:02:20,950 --> 01:02:21,370
Hahahaha.

2064
01:02:24,670 --> 01:02:26,490
Where everybody just wears that.

2065
01:02:26,550 --> 01:02:27,330
For uni.

2066
01:02:27,550 --> 01:02:28,030
Hahahaha.

2067
01:02:30,090 --> 01:02:31,330
In high school.

2068
01:02:31,430 --> 01:02:33,230
Oh my god speaking of school.

2069
01:02:33,370 --> 01:02:34,490
Did you guys know they changed.

01:02:34,610 --> 01:02:37,070

On a YouTube short.

2075
01:02:46,430 --> 01:02:46,750
Hahahaha.

2076
01:02:47,170 --> 01:02:49,270

That like the new generation of children.

01:02:54,410 --> 01:02:56,390
Are taught a different way.

2080
01:02:56,550 --> 01:02:57,490

2082
01:02:59,530 --> 01:03:00,950
And it's so weird.

2083
01:03:01,110 --> 01:03:02,390

01:03:37,500 --> 01:03:37,860

The new patch notes just dropped.

2104
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:52,460
And they removed LMNOP.

2105
01:03:52,940 --> 01:03:54,360

2106
01:03:54,600 --> 01:03:56,060

L M N O P Q.

2131
01:05:03,620 --> 01:05:04,180

01:05:06,380 --> 01:05:08,960
It's so oh my god it's so weird.

2133
01:05:09,160 --> 01:05:11,540
It's so they actually can't believe it.

2134
01:05:12,780 --> 01:05:14,060
It's do you know why?

2135
01:05:14,240 --> 01:05:15,760
Do you know why they hotfix.

2136
01:05:15,820 --> 01:05:16,600
They patched it.

2137
01:05:16,860 --> 01:05:18,060

2138
01:05:18,060 --> 01:05:18,700

01:05:19,700 --> 01:05:20,340
Hahahaha.

2140
01:05:20,560 --> 01:05:21,280
In the earth.

01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:24,340

Um so the reason why in season 2024.

2145
01:05:32,600 --> 01:05:33,700
They decided to.

2146
01:05:33,820 --> 01:05:35,820
Bring out the alphabet patch notes.

2147
01:05:35,940 --> 01:05:36,520
Is because.

2148
01:05:37,380 --> 01:05:40,820
Is because L M N O P. Was too hard.

2149
01:05:41,860 --> 01:05:42,500
Hahahaha.

2150
01:05:43,060 --> 01:05:45,300
The fact that they're like.

2151
01:05:45,300 --> 01:05:48,800
Bro L M N O P. Was way too hard for the children.

2152
01:05:48,980 --> 01:05:52,480
I'm like we all learned L M N O P. All of us.

2153
01:05:52,540 --> 01:05:54,400
Nobody had any issue.

2154
01:05:54,760 --> 01:05:57,280
Like nobody had any issues.

2155
01:05:57,340 --> 01:05:59,800
With L M N O P. Hahahaha.

2156
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,280
No I'm not lying it's true.

2157
01:06:02,860 --> 01:06:04,160
Like people were like.

2158
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:09,120
Yeah the kids are always stumbling on L M N O P. We might as well like make it easier.

2159
01:06:09,140 --> 01:06:09,780
For them.

2160
01:06:09,880 --> 01:06:12,120
But L M N O P is the best part.

2161
01:06:12,120 --> 01:06:13,980
It literally sounds like.

2162
01:06:14,040 --> 01:06:15,740
It's the best part of the alphabet.

2163
01:06:16,040 --> 01:06:17,760
I can't even figure it.

2164
01:06:17,940 --> 01:06:19,600
That's so dumb.

2165
01:06:20,720 --> 01:06:21,200
Hahahaha.

2166
01:06:22,940 --> 01:06:23,420
Hahahaha.

2167
01:06:23,880 --> 01:06:24,360
Um.

2168
01:06:25,180 --> 01:06:27,100
But yeah I found that out.

2169
01:06:27,220 --> 01:06:29,060
On a fucking YouTube short.

2170
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:30,320
And I thought like.

2171
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:31,740
I thought it was a skit.

2172
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:34,140
I didn't realize it was a real thing.

2173
01:06:34,300 --> 01:06:36,120
I found that out like last month.

2174
01:06:36,300 --> 01:06:38,720
And I was like I kept thinking about it for a long time.

2175
01:06:38,920 --> 01:06:40,760
And I keep forgetting to tell you guys about it.

2176
01:06:42,120 --> 01:06:43,240
It was an actual skill issue.

2177
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:46,540
It was the Coco Melon.

2178
01:06:46,800 --> 01:06:48,280

That blew my fucking mind.

2186
01:07:02,780 --> 01:07:03,340
I was so.

2187
01:07:03,640 --> 01:07:05,660
I legitimately just I thought.

2188
01:07:05,880 --> 01:07:07,060
I thought it was.

2189
01:07:07,080 --> 01:07:08,180
I thought it was fake.

2190
01:07:08,580 --> 01:07:11,600
I legitimately thought it was like satire.

2191
01:07:12,120 --> 01:07:14,180
From like the onion or some shit.

2192
01:07:14,380 --> 01:07:15,580
But it's real.

2193
01:07:15,840 --> 01:07:17,660
It's actually real.

2194
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:20,000
The fucking.

2195
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:22,460
Season 2024 update.

2196
01:07:22,820 --> 01:07:24,100
Oh my god.

2197
01:07:24,800 --> 01:07:25,500
Um.

2198
01:07:26,340 --> 01:07:28,320
I wish it was.

2199
01:07:28,360 --> 01:07:28,960
Fake.

2200
01:07:29,720 --> 01:07:30,420
Um.

2201
01:07:31,860 --> 01:07:34,400
I had a hard time.

2202
01:07:34,520 --> 01:07:36,220
Like wrapping my head.

2203
01:07:36,300 --> 01:07:38,080
At the thought that like LMNOP.

2204
01:07:38,180 --> 01:07:39,680
Literally doesn't exist anymore.

2205
01:07:40,020 --> 01:07:41,600
Alright thank you for the super chat.

2206
01:07:42,120 --> 01:07:42,460
Thank you.

2207
01:07:42,580 --> 01:07:44,680
They thought LMNOP was too OP.

2208
01:07:44,820 --> 01:07:46,640
So they literally dropped it.

2209
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:48,120
Thank you for the super chat.

2210
01:07:48,240 --> 01:07:49,120

Hot take from a former teacher.

2217
01:08:01,840 --> 01:08:03,340
But the best way of teaching language.

2218
01:08:03,420 --> 01:08:04,960
Was settled like 60 years ago.

2219
01:08:05,180 --> 01:08:07,160
But tech pro mentality makes people think.

2220
01:08:07,160 --> 01:08:08,840
We need change for the sake of change.

2221
01:08:09,060 --> 01:08:09,860
Thank you for the super chat.

2222
01:08:09,940 --> 01:08:10,880

And then assemble it yourself.

2261
01:09:23,980 --> 01:09:24,780
I actually.

2262
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:25,500
I'm curious.

2263
01:09:25,760 --> 01:09:26,040
Like.

2264
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:26,720
Here you go.

2265
01:09:27,840 --> 01:09:29,120
This is what it is.

2266
01:09:34,500 --> 01:09:36,320
Thank you for coming to AMG.

2267
01:09:36,360 --> 01:09:38,480
First time I ever got to join a meet and greet.

2268
01:09:39,440 --> 01:09:43,520
Fuck waffle and LMNOP is actually different in Australia.

2269
01:09:43,900 --> 01:09:45,660
Thank you for the magenta soupa.

2270
01:09:45,660 --> 01:09:47,820
Thank you for very first magenta soupa too.

2271
01:09:47,940 --> 01:09:48,780
Thank you, thank you.

2272
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:51,840
I mean, there's literally one person at least bought it.

2273
01:09:52,020 --> 01:09:55,380
Guys, there's only five left and who the fuck spent $48,000?

2274
01:09:56,180 --> 01:09:57,240
What the fuck?

2275
01:09:57,240 --> 01:10:00,640
Somebody spent $48,000 on a...

2276
01:10:01,230 --> 01:10:02,520
I want to know what his...

2277
01:10:03,030 --> 01:10:05,720
Okay, picture does not match the real price.

2278
01:10:11,400 --> 01:10:16,620
Okay, apparently the picture is not what the house actually looks like.

2279
01:10:16,760 --> 01:10:21,200
Oh my god, to that one guy that ordered the $48,000 house.

2280
01:10:21,740 --> 01:10:25,720
Oh, somebody gave it five stars for this $5,000 house.

2281
01:10:25,980 --> 01:10:26,820
What does it say?

2282
01:10:27,240 --> 01:10:28,300
It is so cool.

2283
01:10:28,460 --> 01:10:30,480
Thanks Brandon for...

2284
01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:31,660
Wait, is this a YouTuber?

2285
01:10:32,460 --> 01:10:33,320
What the fuck?

2286
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:34,400
Is this...

2287
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:34,680
Okay.

2288
01:10:34,860 --> 01:10:35,960
Oh, okay.

2289
01:10:36,040 --> 01:10:36,540
Never mind.

2290
01:10:36,580 --> 01:10:37,140
No, it's not.

2291
01:10:37,220 --> 01:10:37,720
It's a founder.

2292
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:40,560
Bro, somebody liked it.

2293
01:10:40,820 --> 01:10:45,660
Somebody from the United States liked this folding prefab house.

2294
01:10:46,680 --> 01:10:48,180
Yeah, you can literally...

2295
01:10:48,180 --> 01:10:50,600
If you guys want to buy a house...

2296
01:10:51,060 --> 01:10:55,540
Somebody left six ratings for this 40 feet tiny house to live in?

2297
01:10:56,040 --> 01:10:56,940
Oh my god.

2298
01:10:57,520 --> 01:10:58,420
Who did this?

2299
01:10:59,120 --> 01:10:59,900
Very good.

2300
01:11:03,500 --> 01:11:04,880
Awesome house for the price.

2301
01:11:05,240 --> 01:11:07,680
You just need to find a good space of land and you're all set.

2302
01:11:07,880 --> 01:11:09,360
Just plan it out and make sure...

2303
01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:09,580
Whoa!

2304
01:11:10,620 --> 01:11:12,060
A lot of people like it.

2305
01:11:12,120 --> 01:11:13,340
Easy to install.

2306
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:14,260
I don't...

2307
01:11:14,900 --> 01:11:16,040
Wait, I don't like this.

2308
01:11:17,100 --> 01:11:17,540
Okay.

2309
01:11:17,800 --> 01:11:18,460
I don't want to...

2310
01:11:18,460 --> 01:11:20,080
This guy actually has his real name.

2311
01:11:20,360 --> 01:11:21,460
Wait, I like this review.

2312
01:11:21,820 --> 01:11:24,700
I think this is my favorite review out of all of them.

2313
01:11:25,080 --> 01:11:25,520
Okay.

2314
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:26,800
I'm going to save this real fast.

2315
01:11:27,420 --> 01:11:28,340
I actually...

2316
01:11:28,340 --> 01:11:32,060
I made sure to like hide the name because I actually think that's his real name.

2317
01:11:32,220 --> 01:11:35,240
And he put his real name in the review.

2318
01:11:36,340 --> 01:11:37,480
I like this review.

2319
01:11:39,460 --> 01:11:40,640
Easy to install.

2320
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:43,040
I didn't buy it, but it looks easy.

2321
01:11:52,660 --> 01:11:53,360
That's crazy.

2322
01:11:54,100 --> 01:11:56,600
It's actually crazy that you can buy a house now.

2323
01:11:58,820 --> 01:12:00,460
It's fucking wild.

2324
01:12:04,200 --> 01:12:05,440
Oh my God.

2325
01:12:10,380 --> 01:12:12,600
But yeah, that's basically what...

2326
01:12:13,820 --> 01:12:14,100
Oh yeah.

2327
01:12:14,180 --> 01:12:21,300
I mean, 110 people were super curious about buying a house, you know, and they were all super curious being like, whoa.

2328
01:12:21,620 --> 01:12:22,980
I wonder what that's like.

2329
01:12:23,120 --> 01:12:23,340
Yeah.

2330
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:25,440
Like being able...

2331
01:12:25,440 --> 01:12:27,360
I was just wondering how do you deliver that?

2332
01:12:27,560 --> 01:12:29,140
Like deliver a house over?

2333
01:12:29,640 --> 01:12:31,100
Like, oh my God.

2334
01:12:31,240 --> 01:12:33,160
Like that has to be a separate thing.

2335
01:12:33,280 --> 01:12:35,940
Like a separate delivery truck that's sending it over.

2336
01:12:36,320 --> 01:12:38,660
Like how, like how does that work?

2337
01:12:38,860 --> 01:12:40,380
I don't understand.

2338
01:12:41,100 --> 01:12:41,480
All right.

2339
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:45,040
I'm looking at my amazon.ca prefab house now.

2340
01:12:45,280 --> 01:12:46,900
I want to know, can I prime it?

2341
01:12:47,180 --> 01:12:48,620
Is there, is there...

2342
01:12:48,620 --> 01:12:49,760
There's no prime.

2343
01:12:49,940 --> 01:12:50,860
What's the point?

2344
01:12:51,220 --> 01:12:53,180
What's the point if I don't have Amazon?

2345
01:12:53,180 --> 01:12:59,220
Amazon Prime for my... if I don't have... if I can't Amazon Prime my house.

2346
01:12:59,460 --> 01:13:00,680
Like, what's the point?

2347
01:13:01,820 --> 01:13:04,640
Where's my one-day shipping, Amazon?

2348
01:13:05,240 --> 01:13:06,600
Where is it?

2349
01:13:11,160 --> 01:13:13,080
No same-day shipping?

2350
01:13:13,360 --> 01:13:14,820
What a fucking scam.

2351
01:13:16,040 --> 01:13:19,520
Oh my god, the fastest is September 4th?

2352
01:13:19,640 --> 01:13:22,200
I can literally get a house on September 4th.

2353
01:13:22,200 --> 01:13:22,900
Holy shit.

2354
01:13:23,180 --> 01:13:25,460
Guys, you know how you're always saying I should buy a house?

2355
01:13:25,700 --> 01:13:26,460
I just...

2356
01:13:27,240 --> 01:13:29,840
It's only 7k and it comes with a bathroom.

2357
01:13:30,220 --> 01:13:30,620
Chat.

2358
01:13:30,860 --> 01:13:33,440
This is some otherworlds dystopian shit.

2359
01:13:33,700 --> 01:13:35,380
Thank you for the super chat.

2360
01:13:35,480 --> 01:13:36,320
Thank you, thank you.

2361
01:13:36,400 --> 01:13:38,320
You guys always tell me to buy a house.

2362
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:40,580
It's literally 7k and it comes with a bathroom.

2363
01:13:41,200 --> 01:13:41,600
Guys.

2364
01:13:42,280 --> 01:13:43,760
Boss, you don't have land.

2365
01:13:44,340 --> 01:13:45,320
It's okay, I can rent land.

2366
01:13:49,140 --> 01:13:50,660
I'll just live in the woods.

2367
01:13:53,180 --> 01:13:56,440
There must be some form of land that I can rent.

2368
01:14:00,700 --> 01:14:01,740
Everyone rents.

2369
01:14:01,740 --> 01:14:04,420
You guys said I should start buying a house.

2370
01:14:04,720 --> 01:14:06,160
You never said I should...

2371
01:14:06,160 --> 01:14:08,980
You never said I should buy land.

2372
01:14:10,080 --> 01:14:11,420
Sean, thank you for the super chat.

2373
01:14:11,500 --> 01:14:12,380
Thank you, thank you.

2374
01:14:12,460 --> 01:14:18,140
If Jeff Bezos can't deliver my prefab house via Choreodrone, then what is the point?

2375
01:14:18,600 --> 01:14:19,720
What's the point?

2376
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:22,500
Thank you for the super chat, Sean.

2377
01:14:22,620 --> 01:14:23,020
Thank you.

2378
01:14:23,180 --> 01:14:24,260
That's true, though.

2379
01:14:24,340 --> 01:14:27,420
What's the point if they can drone my house over?

2380
01:14:28,100 --> 01:14:35,220
They can just attach... it can be like Up where they attach like a thousand drones on the house and it just flies over.

2381
01:14:35,660 --> 01:14:41,960
By the way, I talked about this before, but you can Airbnb literally the house of Up.

2382
01:14:42,740 --> 01:14:45,340
Which is... I still think that's fucking crazy.

2383
01:14:46,460 --> 01:14:47,440
That's the thing.

2384
01:14:48,300 --> 01:14:48,820
That's...

2385
01:14:48,820 --> 01:14:51,100
Oh my god, did you guys see that?

2386
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:52,900
It's so... okay.

2387
01:14:52,900 --> 01:14:54,980
Since we're talking about dystopian shit.

2388
01:14:55,160 --> 01:15:02,920
Did you guys see that tweet of the Deadpool actor at Disneyland making a joke about the Disney plus TOS?

2389
01:15:03,360 --> 01:15:05,860
Like, holy fuck.

2390
01:15:06,380 --> 01:15:11,340
It's just like... bro, that's so fucked.

2391
01:15:11,800 --> 01:15:16,520
I was like, yeah, like... that's so fucked.

2392
01:15:17,440 --> 01:15:19,980
That's so dystopian.

2393
01:15:24,820 --> 01:15:29,440
I was just like, bro, like, there's no way.

2394
01:15:31,560 --> 01:15:36,460
I was like, no, that dude definitely lost his job for that.

2395
01:15:36,640 --> 01:15:39,140
There's no way that was approved.

2396
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:41,240
There's no fucking...

2397
01:15:41,240 --> 01:15:49,180
No, it was like... it was like at Disneyland and like he made a joke about the Disney plus TOS.

2398
01:15:49,180 --> 01:15:53,000
And I'm like, at Disney World.

2399
01:15:53,980 --> 01:15:56,640
Bro, the fucked up...

2400
01:15:56,640 --> 01:16:03,120
No, the reason why it's so fucked up is because the whole incident happened in Disney World.

2401
01:16:03,420 --> 01:16:04,000
Like...

2402
01:16:05,180 --> 01:16:09,280
It's like, bro, that is like so fucked.

2403
01:16:09,800 --> 01:16:10,480
Like...

2404
01:16:11,180 --> 01:16:12,980
Oh my god.

2405
01:16:13,580 --> 01:16:14,460
Oh...

2406
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,300
And people were like...

2407
01:16:18,300 --> 01:16:19,340
Holy shit.

2408
01:16:21,900 --> 01:16:29,580
To be fair, I don't know if you guys know this, but working in Disneyland slash Disney World is really bad.

2409
01:16:30,060 --> 01:16:32,480
Like, it's... I don't know if you guys...

2410
01:16:32,480 --> 01:16:34,120
Oh no, Disney's gonna get you.

2411
01:16:34,320 --> 01:16:36,380
Like, everybody's talked about this, but like...

2412
01:16:36,380 --> 01:16:38,000
I don't know if it improved.

2413
01:16:38,440 --> 01:16:42,320
I don't know if it improved, but the old Disney program...

2414
01:16:42,320 --> 01:16:44,340
I heard about, like, the Disney program.

2415
01:16:44,760 --> 01:16:48,280
And, like, working at Disneyland and Disney World is really bad.

2416
01:16:48,280 --> 01:16:50,280
It's worse than, like...

2417
01:16:50,280 --> 01:16:52,660
The actual minimum wage jobs.

2418
01:16:52,860 --> 01:16:53,860
Like, people would be like...

2419
01:16:53,860 --> 01:16:56,300
Ah, like, yeah, it's my dream come true to...

2420
01:16:56,300 --> 01:16:58,520
work at Disneyland and everything.

2421
01:16:58,840 --> 01:17:02,120
But it's literally one of the worst jobs you can get.

2422
01:17:02,580 --> 01:17:03,060
Because...

2423
01:17:03,560 --> 01:17:04,360
Like, you know...

2424
01:17:04,360 --> 01:17:06,060
Like, overheating and stuff like that.

2425
01:17:06,100 --> 01:17:08,320
Working outside for...

2426
01:17:09,040 --> 01:17:10,780
I work at Disneyland...

2427
01:17:10,780 --> 01:17:11,980
Its, smile...

2428
01:17:15,340 --> 01:17:15,820
Oh...

2429
01:17:18,080 --> 01:17:20,640
It's actually not a great job.

2430
01:17:20,960 --> 01:17:24,560
The thing is, it's because they take advantage of the workers.

2431
01:17:25,540 --> 01:17:29,280
Because they're like, oh, I just want to work at Disney because it's my dream.

2432
01:17:29,380 --> 01:17:31,940
My dream to work with Disney, you know?

2433
01:17:32,120 --> 01:17:34,680
So they take advantage of the Disney magic.

2434
01:17:35,100 --> 01:17:37,580
And then that's how they hook you.

2435
01:17:37,660 --> 01:17:39,200
And then you actually work there.

2436
01:17:39,480 --> 01:17:44,080
And then you're like, wait, this is actually a terrible job.

2437
01:17:44,080 --> 01:17:45,940
It's basically like...

2438
01:17:45,940 --> 01:17:48,660
Yeah, that's what somebody said.

2439
01:17:48,760 --> 01:17:50,500
It's like working a minimum wage job.

2440
01:17:51,860 --> 01:17:57,380
But then you have to have the credentials of PhD people or something.

2441
01:17:57,680 --> 01:17:59,280
And you barely get paid anything.

2442
01:17:59,820 --> 01:18:02,580
You barely get paid anything to fucking survive.

2443
01:18:05,800 --> 01:18:11,200
But this is like... I don't know if it's the same for other Disney lands and different countries.

2444
01:18:11,340 --> 01:18:13,420
But this is what I know about America.

2445
01:18:14,080 --> 01:18:15,500
This is what I know about Disney land.

2446
01:18:19,300 --> 01:18:22,060
No, but then that's basically any job.

2447
01:18:22,200 --> 01:18:24,140
Yeah, but the rules are more strict.

2448
01:18:24,460 --> 01:18:25,180
I don't know.

2449
01:18:25,280 --> 01:18:25,760
Have you guys...

2450
01:18:25,760 --> 01:18:30,620
Okay, I read an article about Disneyland worker rules.

2451
01:18:30,920 --> 01:18:31,860
The rules...

2452
01:18:31,860 --> 01:18:34,360
Because you have to uphold the Disney magic.

2453
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:42,200
And so they make sure that the rules are incredibly strict.

2454
01:18:44,080 --> 01:18:44,840
Just so like...

2455
01:18:45,460 --> 01:18:47,480
Just so you have to like...

2456
01:18:48,040 --> 01:18:50,300
Because you have to keep up the Disney magic and everything.

2457
01:18:50,620 --> 01:18:52,760
You can't... Okay, like, let me look through it.

2458
01:18:54,180 --> 01:18:55,160
This is funny.

2459
01:18:55,340 --> 01:18:58,180
They aren't allowed to say, I don't know.

2460
01:18:58,800 --> 01:18:59,920
Like, what the fuck?

2461
01:19:04,400 --> 01:19:05,340
They're not...

2462
01:19:06,760 --> 01:19:09,120
You're not allowed to say, I don't know.

2463
01:19:09,160 --> 01:19:10,820
You have to have an answer to everything.

2464
01:19:10,980 --> 01:19:12,580
That's so fucking weird.

2465
01:19:12,580 --> 01:19:13,240
Like...

2466
01:19:14,120 --> 01:19:15,620
That's so...

2467
01:19:15,620 --> 01:19:16,340
You have...

2468
01:19:16,340 --> 01:19:18,900
Yeah, I know that you have to be in character.

2469
01:19:19,100 --> 01:19:21,940
Nothing exists outside of Disney.

2470
01:19:23,300 --> 01:19:24,520
What the fuck?

2471
01:19:26,320 --> 01:19:33,600
For cast members playing characters, they must act like nothing exists out of the Disney universe.

2472
01:19:34,260 --> 01:19:36,460
Oh my God.

2473
01:19:39,460 --> 01:19:40,180
Oh my God.

2474
01:19:40,420 --> 01:19:41,940
Don't break character.

2475
01:19:42,580 --> 01:19:42,720
Okay.

2476
01:19:45,960 --> 01:19:46,580
Let's see.

2477
01:19:46,660 --> 01:19:47,220
Oh, there are requirements.

2478
01:19:47,800 --> 01:19:48,440
I know about that.

2479
01:19:49,440 --> 01:19:51,700
But it's like super strict.

2480
01:19:52,460 --> 01:19:52,980
Everything.

2481
01:19:53,360 --> 01:19:54,800
They can't fangirl.

2482
01:19:56,620 --> 01:19:57,900
The talking code.

2483
01:19:58,000 --> 01:19:58,420
I know that.

2484
01:19:58,640 --> 01:19:59,060
Oh, yeah.

2485
01:19:59,060 --> 01:20:01,500
Social media posts are a no-no.

2486
01:20:02,320 --> 01:20:04,900
So, you're not allowed to talk about...

2487
01:20:04,900 --> 01:20:06,100
You're not allowed...

2488
01:20:06,100 --> 01:20:06,940
They can't point.

2489
01:20:07,080 --> 01:20:07,400
Oh, yeah.

2490
01:20:07,440 --> 01:20:08,640
They can't point also.

2491
01:20:08,760 --> 01:20:11,940
Because pointing is offensive in some parts of the world.

2492
01:20:11,940 --> 01:20:13,780
So, they can't point or anything.

2493
01:20:14,320 --> 01:20:17,740
And you can't post anything about being a Disneyland worker.

2494
01:20:17,960 --> 01:20:18,760
Like, publicly.

2495
01:20:19,020 --> 01:20:19,760
Or anything.

2496
01:20:22,720 --> 01:20:23,400
Let's see.

2497
01:20:24,400 --> 01:20:25,740
Wait, they can't bend down?

2498
01:20:25,880 --> 01:20:26,700
Wait, is that true?

2499
01:20:26,860 --> 01:20:27,540
There's no way.

2500
01:20:29,500 --> 01:20:31,880
They can't bend down and pick it off the ground.

2501
01:20:31,980 --> 01:20:32,380
That would...

2502
01:20:32,380 --> 01:20:32,920
What?

2503
01:20:33,760 --> 01:20:37,240
That would be too obvious and take guests out of the moment.

2504
01:20:37,580 --> 01:20:41,260
Instead, cast members have to use the swoop and scoop motion...

2505
01:20:41,260 --> 01:20:44,040
to gracefully remove garbage from the ground.

2506
01:20:44,260 --> 01:20:45,360
What the fuck?

2507
01:20:47,580 --> 01:20:53,780
What the fuck does that rule?

2508
01:20:58,100 --> 01:21:02,220
Oh, my God.

2509
01:21:02,480 --> 01:21:03,160
That's...

2510
01:21:05,040 --> 01:21:05,800
Alright.

2511
01:21:07,180 --> 01:21:07,940
Okay.

2512
01:21:08,020 --> 01:21:08,520
Let's see.

2513
01:21:11,040 --> 01:21:11,800
Wait.

2514
01:21:14,940 --> 01:21:15,220
This is funny.

2515
01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:20,680
Someone was like, when I was there, they had a rule of no dating other cast members.

2516
01:21:21,400 --> 01:21:21,660
Like...

2517
01:21:23,560 --> 01:21:25,020
What the fuck?

2518
01:21:25,640 --> 01:21:26,180
Okay.

2519
01:21:27,440 --> 01:21:28,160
Let's see.

2520
01:21:29,120 --> 01:21:29,800
What else?

2521
01:21:30,380 --> 01:21:32,400
Don't raise your hands if you're tall.

2522
01:21:32,580 --> 01:21:33,420
Don't do it.

2523
01:21:33,520 --> 01:21:33,740
What?

2524
01:21:35,260 --> 01:21:36,880
What the fuck does that mean?

2525
01:21:37,260 --> 01:21:37,800
What?

2526
01:21:39,060 --> 01:21:40,140
No dating.

2527
01:21:40,160 --> 01:21:41,020
Guest out.

2528
01:21:43,640 --> 01:21:44,200
Oh, my God.

2529
01:21:44,200 --> 01:21:46,280
Mickey can't date Minnie Mouse?

2530
01:21:46,500 --> 01:21:48,020
Like, how does that happen?

2531
01:21:51,520 --> 01:21:52,600
Oh, my God.

2532
01:21:53,080 --> 01:21:53,640
Wait.

2533
01:21:53,820 --> 01:21:55,480
But what about Mickey and Minnie?

2534
01:21:57,780 --> 01:21:59,120
Following the five keys.

2535
01:21:59,280 --> 01:21:59,920
Wearing it.

2536
01:22:00,140 --> 01:22:00,680
Yeah.

2537
01:22:00,700 --> 01:22:01,700
Saying I don't know.

2538
01:22:05,280 --> 01:22:06,140
Let's see.

2539
01:22:06,400 --> 01:22:07,400
Protecting the magic.

2540
01:22:08,080 --> 01:22:08,640
Yeah.

2541
01:22:08,700 --> 01:22:09,460
It's actually crazy.

2542
01:22:09,460 --> 01:22:10,600
Like, the...

2543
01:22:11,360 --> 01:22:15,660
It's just incredibly strict for the Disney workers.

2544
01:22:15,980 --> 01:22:25,780
It's incredibly strict for the fact that you don't get paid much, like, for something like that.

2545
01:22:28,180 --> 01:22:30,600
Because you have to protect the magic.

2546
01:22:30,780 --> 01:22:32,320
You have to protect it.

2547
01:22:32,480 --> 01:22:34,600
So, you have to get new glasses.

2548
01:22:37,460 --> 01:22:38,700
You'll never see...

2549
01:22:38,700 --> 01:22:39,560
Oh, I mean, that's true.

2550
01:22:39,980 --> 01:22:43,700
All glasses must be conservative in color and design, which isn't too big.

2551
01:22:43,740 --> 01:22:46,380
I guess because they want everybody to have the same type of glasses.

2552
01:22:46,680 --> 01:22:51,660
So, like, everybody, like, basically looks the same type deal.

2553
01:22:52,320 --> 01:22:52,760
So...

2554
01:22:55,720 --> 01:22:57,740
So, I guess that makes sense, you know?

2555
01:22:57,960 --> 01:23:01,140
I guess that makes sense because they don't want people to...

2556
01:23:01,720 --> 01:23:06,580
They won't want people to, like, look, like, too flashy or anything.

2557
01:23:07,160 --> 01:23:08,340
That's such a weird rule.

2558
01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:09,460
It does...

2559
01:23:09,460 --> 01:23:11,800
It does feel like a weird rule, though.

2560
01:23:11,920 --> 01:23:13,460
There's Disney University?

2561
01:23:14,360 --> 01:23:17,140
This isn't a guideline so much as a requirement.

2562
01:23:17,380 --> 01:23:27,960
New employees must attend what is known as a Disney University for classes in which they learn everything there is to know about Disney's history and magic.

2563
01:23:28,260 --> 01:23:32,680
They first must attend a traditional orientation which runs through all the basics.

2564
01:23:32,860 --> 01:23:35,080
It's where the employment journey begins.

2565
01:23:35,440 --> 01:23:38,500
What the fuck do you learn at Disney University?

2566
01:23:39,520 --> 01:23:41,320
There's Disney College?

2567
01:23:41,980 --> 01:23:42,520
Alright.

2568
01:23:42,640 --> 01:23:48,680
Formerly known as the University of Disneyland is the global training program for employees at the par...

2569
01:23:48,680 --> 01:23:49,700
Holy fuck!

2570
01:23:49,980 --> 01:23:52,180
I didn't even know this exists.

2571
01:23:52,940 --> 01:23:54,560
They have to learn...

2572
01:23:55,120 --> 01:23:55,780
Wait!

2573
01:23:55,960 --> 01:23:57,920
There's Disney University!

2574
01:23:58,720 --> 01:23:59,440
What?

2575
01:23:59,500 --> 01:23:59,880
Okay.

2576
01:24:00,080 --> 01:24:01,680
I didn't know what you learned there.

2577
01:24:01,800 --> 01:24:04,440
What do you learn at Disney University?

2578
01:24:05,320 --> 01:24:07,620
The Disney College program.

2579
01:24:07,620 --> 01:24:08,760
The whole...

2580
01:24:09,380 --> 01:24:10,260
There's housing!

2581
01:24:10,760 --> 01:24:11,120
Wait!

2582
01:24:11,280 --> 01:24:12,120
It's actually...

2583
01:24:12,120 --> 01:24:13,140
There's college credit!

2584
01:24:13,740 --> 01:24:15,400
Oh, it doesn't...

2585
01:24:19,400 --> 01:24:21,000
The Disney Ice...

2586
01:24:21,360 --> 01:24:21,720
Okay.

2587
01:24:22,180 --> 01:24:25,240
Even I didn't know about the Disney University.

2588
01:24:25,540 --> 01:24:26,040
That...

2589
01:24:26,040 --> 01:24:26,860
That's funny.

2590
01:24:27,160 --> 01:24:28,460
That's fucked up.

2591
01:24:28,520 --> 01:24:29,620
But that's funny.

2592
01:24:34,280 --> 01:24:34,640
Wait!

2593
01:24:34,980 --> 01:24:36,680
Don't tell me that's a real thing.

2594
01:24:36,680 --> 01:24:38,360
Please tell me you're fucking with me.

2595
01:24:39,760 --> 01:24:41,300
Oh my god!

2596
01:24:42,180 --> 01:24:44,080
There's a hamburger university?

2597
01:24:45,620 --> 01:24:46,820
Holy shit!

2598
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:47,220
Wait!

2599
01:24:47,320 --> 01:24:49,680
Is there a university for every major corporation?

2600
01:24:50,840 --> 01:24:51,440
Wait!

2601
01:24:51,500 --> 01:24:52,180
Is that real?

2602
01:24:53,360 --> 01:24:56,100
There's a hamburger university.

2603
01:24:56,560 --> 01:24:58,220
The more you know.

2604
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:02,520
Tuition is $48,000 per semester?

2605
01:25:02,940 --> 01:25:03,820
There's no way.

2606
01:25:03,900 --> 01:25:05,280
You have to be fucking with me.

2607
01:25:05,320 --> 01:25:06,160
I need to look that up.

2608
01:25:06,160 --> 01:25:07,620
I need to look that up.

2609
01:25:07,680 --> 01:25:08,540
How much is tuition?

2610
01:25:09,980 --> 01:25:10,420
Tuition.

2611
01:25:11,260 --> 01:25:12,260
There's no way.

2612
01:25:13,920 --> 01:25:14,360
Okay.

2613
01:25:14,440 --> 01:25:15,640
Oh, thank god.

2614
01:25:15,820 --> 01:25:16,060
Okay.

2615
01:25:16,100 --> 01:25:16,800
Upon acceptance.

2616
01:25:17,420 --> 01:25:17,860
Okay.

2617
01:25:17,940 --> 01:25:18,540
It's not bad.

2618
01:25:18,800 --> 01:25:19,420
It's not bad.

2619
01:25:19,560 --> 01:25:20,820
It's like around...

2620
01:25:21,880 --> 01:25:23,060
Guys, it's not bad.

2621
01:25:23,180 --> 01:25:23,600
Guys.

2622
01:25:23,940 --> 01:25:27,520
It's like $240 for program fees.

2623
01:25:27,760 --> 01:25:29,020
You know, this is actually...

2624
01:25:29,020 --> 01:25:29,640
Oh, wait.

2625
01:25:29,720 --> 01:25:30,520
This is pretty good.

2626
01:25:30,580 --> 01:25:32,700
It's $455, guys.

2627
01:25:32,820 --> 01:25:33,760
If you guys want to go...

2628
01:25:33,760 --> 01:25:34,700
Guys, afford...

2629
01:25:34,700 --> 01:25:35,280
You know what?

2630
01:25:35,480 --> 01:25:36,140
Despite everything I've said...

2631
01:25:36,140 --> 01:25:38,020
At least it's affordable.

2632
01:25:38,460 --> 01:25:38,920
You know?

2633
01:25:38,960 --> 01:25:40,480
At least it's not like...

2634
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:43,460
Like hundreds of thousands of dollars a day.

2635
01:25:43,620 --> 01:25:44,740
At least it's affordable.

2636
01:25:46,140 --> 01:25:47,260
At least...

2637
01:25:47,260 --> 01:25:48,060
At least...

2638
01:25:48,060 --> 01:25:49,860
I'll just say that.

2639
01:25:50,160 --> 01:25:50,720
$450?

2640
01:25:51,560 --> 01:25:52,120
Like...

2641
01:25:52,120 --> 01:25:53,800
For the entire semester?

2642
01:25:54,300 --> 01:25:55,340
That's pretty affordable.

2643
01:25:55,800 --> 01:25:56,720
For this university.

2644
01:25:58,700 --> 01:25:59,260
Like...

2645
01:26:02,860 --> 01:26:04,460
Like in America.

2646
01:26:04,640 --> 01:26:04,920
No.

2647
01:26:04,920 --> 01:26:05,720
You guys have to know.

2648
01:26:05,740 --> 01:26:06,120
If we're doing...

2649
01:26:06,120 --> 01:26:06,400
For those...

2650
01:26:06,400 --> 01:26:08,240
It's not affordable on a Disney salary.

2651
01:26:08,480 --> 01:26:10,220
The fact that you have to get another...

2652
01:26:10,220 --> 01:26:19,320
You have to get a part-time job to like be able to afford the Disney University because you can't make enough under the Disney...

2653
01:26:19,320 --> 01:26:22,960
Under working for Disneyland to pay for the program.

2654
01:26:23,220 --> 01:26:24,380
That's the fucked up part.

2655
01:26:24,600 --> 01:26:25,220
That's not...

2656
01:26:25,220 --> 01:26:26,100
Not a part.

2657
01:26:27,200 --> 01:26:29,440
For those who are like, $40 is a lot.

2658
01:26:29,760 --> 01:26:30,880
You guys don't understand.

2659
01:26:30,960 --> 01:26:32,220
American universities...

2660
01:26:32,220 --> 01:26:33,820
I know like in Europe...

2661
01:26:35,300 --> 01:26:36,020
It's crazy.

2662
01:26:36,100 --> 01:26:38,320
I know it's really crazy for some Americans to know this.

2663
01:26:38,500 --> 01:26:39,680
But in Europe...

2664
01:26:39,680 --> 01:26:40,480
Sometimes...

2665
01:26:40,480 --> 01:26:43,440
In Europe, the government sometimes pay you to go to university.

2666
01:26:44,340 --> 01:26:46,880
Which is pretty fucked up when you compare it to American university.

2667
01:26:47,280 --> 01:26:48,240
Where like...

2668
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:50,980
It's very expensive.

2669
01:26:56,040 --> 01:26:56,520
Yeah.

2670
01:26:56,920 --> 01:26:58,220
So a lot of like...

2671
01:26:58,220 --> 01:27:00,420
I like how some Americans are like, wait, really?

2672
01:27:00,760 --> 01:27:01,220
Yeah.

2673
01:27:01,280 --> 01:27:03,800
So like in Europe, there's some European countries.

2674
01:27:03,800 --> 01:27:05,200
That literally pay...

2675
01:27:05,800 --> 01:27:07,380
That literally like...

2676
01:27:09,500 --> 01:27:10,620
Pay the...

2677
01:27:10,620 --> 01:27:13,040
Pay people to go to their university.

2678
01:27:13,380 --> 01:27:16,600
And then I know like in Australia, I don't know if they changed it.

2679
01:27:16,780 --> 01:27:22,300
But in Australia, basically, like you go to university and the government pays for it.

2680
01:27:22,380 --> 01:27:23,580
And if you make...

2681
01:27:23,580 --> 01:27:29,140
If you graduate university and make enough money, like enough money...

2682
01:27:29,800 --> 01:27:33,360
Like they give like a certain point where if you make that much money...

2683
01:27:33,360 --> 01:27:34,740
You have to pay back the...

2684
01:27:34,740 --> 01:27:36,080
Pay back the tuition.

2685
01:27:37,420 --> 01:27:41,020
But if you don't make that much money on your job...

2686
01:27:41,020 --> 01:27:44,700
After you graduate university, you don't have to pay for the tuition.

2687
01:27:44,920 --> 01:27:46,500
You don't have to pay for your university.

2688
01:27:48,860 --> 01:27:49,720
In Australia.

2689
01:27:50,740 --> 01:27:52,500
So like that's what I know.

2690
01:27:52,620 --> 01:27:53,560
But yeah, I know like...

2691
01:27:53,560 --> 01:27:58,280
Although like a lot of European countries pay for students to go to university and stuff.

2692
01:27:58,380 --> 01:28:00,160
Which is fucking crazy to think about.

2693
01:28:01,560 --> 01:28:02,520
That's cheating.

2694
01:28:07,480 --> 01:28:10,220
I'm sold moving there now.

2695
01:28:14,760 --> 01:28:17,020
I know how you guys are like, I'm sold.

2696
01:28:17,080 --> 01:28:17,640
I'm going to move there.

2697
01:28:17,820 --> 01:28:20,160
Like how somebody said taxes are a lot more expensive.

2698
01:28:21,220 --> 01:28:21,880
Taxes are...

2699
01:28:22,560 --> 01:28:24,160
Taxes are crazy though.

2700
01:28:24,300 --> 01:28:27,720
So it's basically like you have to remember.

2701
01:28:28,080 --> 01:28:28,640
You're going to...

2702
01:28:28,640 --> 01:28:32,120
The reason why they can do that is because taxes are really bad.

2703
01:28:32,820 --> 01:28:34,220
They're not really bad.

2704
01:28:34,460 --> 01:28:35,520
I'm not saying taxes are bad.

2705
01:28:35,620 --> 01:28:36,760
I'm not committing tax fraud.

2706
01:28:36,920 --> 01:28:39,760
I'm saying that it's a lot more than what we're used to.

2707
01:28:39,860 --> 01:28:40,840
Like in NA.

2708
01:28:42,180 --> 01:28:44,900
It's a lot more than what we're used to in NA.

2709
01:28:50,480 --> 01:28:51,020
Let's see.

2710
01:28:51,200 --> 01:28:51,620
Sean.

2711
01:28:51,920 --> 01:28:53,000
Thank you for the super chat.

2712
01:28:53,120 --> 01:28:53,340
Thank you.

2713
01:28:53,360 --> 01:28:53,860
Thank you.

2714
01:28:53,880 --> 01:28:57,360
Hi people who think $450 university education is a lot.

2715
01:28:57,440 --> 01:29:00,900
I paid $30,000 for mine and mine is not even the worst.

2716
01:29:00,900 --> 01:29:02,120
Nice to meet you.

2717
01:29:02,260 --> 01:29:04,200
Thank you for the super chat.

2718
01:29:04,420 --> 01:29:05,220
Thank you.

2719
01:29:05,260 --> 01:29:06,260
Thank you.

2720
01:29:08,980 --> 01:29:09,600
Okay.

2721
01:29:10,540 --> 01:29:11,480
But yeah.

2722
01:29:11,700 --> 01:29:12,320
That's...

2723
01:29:12,320 --> 01:29:12,820
Oh my gosh.

2724
01:29:12,860 --> 01:29:13,020
Wait.

2725
01:29:13,100 --> 01:29:13,720
Somebody...

2726
01:29:13,720 --> 01:29:15,560
How much is a Disney college?

2727
01:29:15,780 --> 01:29:16,640
Oh, somebody is...

2728
01:29:16,640 --> 01:29:17,000
Wait.

2729
01:29:17,080 --> 01:29:17,760
There's a Reddit.

2730
01:29:17,900 --> 01:29:21,420
There's literally a subreddit for the Disney college program.

2731
01:29:21,900 --> 01:29:23,020
Oh my God.

2732
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:25,420
I don't know.

2733
01:29:25,460 --> 01:29:26,740
It feels so dystopian.

2734
01:29:27,120 --> 01:29:28,600
Because it feels like...

2735
01:29:28,600 --> 01:29:29,380
Like...

2736
01:29:29,380 --> 01:29:30,880
Like the Disney college program.

2737
01:29:31,820 --> 01:29:32,340
Um...

2738
01:29:32,340 --> 01:29:33,460
Oh my God.

2739
01:29:33,500 --> 01:29:36,800
This is actually feels like Disney adults like applying for this shit.

2740
01:29:36,960 --> 01:29:37,640
But like...

2741
01:29:37,640 --> 01:29:42,240
Like the fact that there's a Disney college program subreddit makes it feel like...

2742
01:29:42,240 --> 01:29:45,580
You know how like students are asking in subreddit about like...

2743
01:29:45,580 --> 01:29:46,220
Oh my God.

2744
01:29:46,280 --> 01:29:46,600
Like...

2745
01:29:46,600 --> 01:29:47,280
Um...

2746
01:29:47,280 --> 01:29:50,000
Has anyone heard about the acceptance letter from Harvard yet?

2747
01:29:50,100 --> 01:29:50,380
Like...

2748
01:29:50,380 --> 01:29:52,560
On the Harvard subreddit.

2749
01:29:52,700 --> 01:29:54,120
Like this is what it feels like.

2750
01:29:54,180 --> 01:29:57,480
I'm reading the Disney college program subreddit right now.

2751
01:29:57,580 --> 01:30:00,000
And then one of the posts was like...

2752
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:00,460
Um...

2753
01:30:00,460 --> 01:30:02,480
Did anybody hear back from the...

2754
01:30:02,480 --> 01:30:03,640
From their interviews yet?

2755
01:30:03,820 --> 01:30:04,120
Like...

2756
01:30:04,120 --> 01:30:05,460
Oh my God.

2757
01:30:05,780 --> 01:30:06,260
They're like...

2758
01:30:06,260 --> 01:30:07,760
I'm still waiting for my phone interview.

2759
01:30:07,940 --> 01:30:08,320
And I'm like...

2760
01:30:08,320 --> 01:30:08,980
Oh my God.

2761
01:30:09,060 --> 01:30:09,780
You poor...

2762
01:30:10,240 --> 01:30:11,460
You poor souls.

2763
01:30:11,720 --> 01:30:12,340
Like...

2764
01:30:12,340 --> 01:30:16,100
Oh my God.

2765
01:30:16,160 --> 01:30:17,180
You poor...

2766
01:30:17,180 --> 01:30:19,620
You poor souls.

2767
01:30:24,260 --> 01:30:25,980
Oh my God.

2768
01:30:26,560 --> 01:30:27,200
This...

2769
01:30:27,200 --> 01:30:27,720
I don't know.

2770
01:30:28,260 --> 01:30:28,900
I...

2771
01:30:28,900 --> 01:30:29,440
I...

2772
01:30:29,440 --> 01:30:29,980
I...

2773
01:30:29,980 --> 01:30:30,440
I...

2774
01:30:30,460 --> 01:30:32,420
I don't know.

2775
01:30:32,420 --> 01:30:32,460
I don't know.

2776
01:30:32,460 --> 01:30:32,600
You have to do well my friend.

2777
01:30:32,600 --> 01:30:33,520
You're cannot save them...

2778
01:30:33,520 --> 01:30:36,440
You can't save...

2779
01:30:36,440 --> 01:30:37,640
They...

2780
01:30:37,640 --> 01:30:41,900
Hey, they've already... they're way too far gone.

2781
01:30:42,200 --> 01:30:44,460
They're way too far gone.

2782
01:30:48,860 --> 01:30:50,520
Like, I'm sorry.

2783
01:30:50,680 --> 01:30:54,240
Like, it's so pessimistic, but, like, I feel like it's so...

2784
01:30:54,240 --> 01:31:00,520
Like, listening to, like, the stories about, like, working for Disneyland and, like...

2785
01:31:00,520 --> 01:31:04,380
Like, Disneyland and Disney World, it sounds like...

2786
01:31:04,380 --> 01:31:11,940
Like, the fact that, like, it's very... it's just not a good time for, like, the amount of money you're being paid.

2787
01:31:12,200 --> 01:31:22,720
Like, just for the... the amount of money that you're paid for the work is just not... it doesn't sound great.

2788
01:31:26,420 --> 01:31:27,800
Oh, my God.

2789
01:31:28,960 --> 01:31:29,520
Anyway.

2790
01:31:29,520 --> 01:31:31,360
Anyway, that's my...

2791
01:31:32,080 --> 01:31:34,200
That's my yap session.

2792
01:31:34,380 --> 01:31:35,200
That's my yap session for today, guys.

2793
01:31:35,480 --> 01:31:35,980
We're...

2794
01:31:35,980 --> 01:31:40,320
If I never am allowed to play Disney games ever again, you know why.

2795
01:31:40,620 --> 01:31:42,680
They're gonna look at this particular stream.

2796
01:31:49,340 --> 01:31:54,380
Also, I think Avatar World and Disneyland fucking is so fucking stupid.

2797
01:31:54,700 --> 01:31:55,900
That's my last take on...

2798
01:31:56,980 --> 01:31:59,280
I think that's a waste of land.

2799
01:31:59,700 --> 01:32:02,020
Who the fuck wanted Avatar World?

2800
01:32:02,180 --> 01:32:04,360
Like, who the fuck wanted that?

2801
01:32:04,380 --> 01:32:08,320
I mean, it's not even that good of a movie.

2802
01:32:08,560 --> 01:32:09,100
Like...

2803
01:32:09,100 --> 01:32:11,720
Like, no, the lore and everything.

2804
01:32:11,960 --> 01:32:15,520
You know they're planning on making Avatar World in, like, a different Disneyland?

2805
01:32:15,740 --> 01:32:17,760
Who the fuck wants that?

2806
01:32:17,900 --> 01:32:19,060
Nobody cares.

2807
01:32:19,560 --> 01:32:26,620
Like, nobody cares about Avatar World, Pandora, the world of Avatar.

2808
01:32:27,200 --> 01:32:27,840
Like...

2809
01:32:28,380 --> 01:32:29,340
It's such...

2810
01:32:29,340 --> 01:32:30,700
It's so stupid.

2811
01:32:31,020 --> 01:32:33,320
Nobody cares about the...

2812
01:32:33,320 --> 01:32:35,720
The world of Avatar.

2813
01:32:36,220 --> 01:32:36,820
Like...

2814
01:32:41,040 --> 01:32:42,220
Nobody wants to...

2815
01:32:42,220 --> 01:32:43,480
I just feel like...

2816
01:32:43,480 --> 01:32:46,480
I just feel like that was such a waste of money.

2817
01:32:46,620 --> 01:32:47,080
Like, I...

2818
01:32:47,080 --> 01:32:49,020
I would want other worlds.

2819
01:32:49,080 --> 01:32:49,620
Like...

2820
01:32:49,620 --> 01:32:50,400
Oh, my God.

2821
01:32:50,500 --> 01:32:52,000
Like, build a fucking...

2822
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:53,280
Build, like...

2823
01:32:53,280 --> 01:32:53,940
I don't know.

2824
01:32:53,980 --> 01:32:54,360
Like...

2825
01:32:54,360 --> 01:32:57,200
Honestly, they could choose any other world.

2826
01:32:57,340 --> 01:32:57,940
Like...

2827
01:32:57,940 --> 01:33:00,840
They could literally choose any other world.

2828
01:33:00,960 --> 01:33:02,880
But they decided to pick...

2829
01:33:02,880 --> 01:33:03,880
Pandora.

2830
01:33:03,940 --> 01:33:05,420
The world of Avatar.

2831
01:33:06,080 --> 01:33:06,680
Like...

2832
01:33:06,680 --> 01:33:07,180
I...

2833
01:33:07,180 --> 01:33:07,940
I'm gonna say it.

2834
01:33:07,980 --> 01:33:09,040
The first movie...

2835
01:33:09,700 --> 01:33:14,140
Insulting my favorite movie feels bad.

2836
01:33:14,560 --> 01:33:17,280
Thank you for the super chat, Snooks.

2837
01:33:17,420 --> 01:33:17,920
Thank you.

2838
01:33:17,920 --> 01:33:18,500
Thank you.

2839
01:33:18,540 --> 01:33:19,760
Did you not see...

2840
01:33:19,760 --> 01:33:19,940
Okay.

2841
01:33:20,040 --> 01:33:21,020
I haven't...

2842
01:33:21,020 --> 01:33:22,420
I saw, like, the...

2843
01:33:22,420 --> 01:33:24,120
I saw the ride...

2844
01:33:24,120 --> 01:33:24,600
The...

2845
01:33:24,600 --> 01:33:25,960
The ride with, like...

2846
01:33:25,960 --> 01:33:29,940
They're like, oh, this is, like, the most expensive animatronic so far.

2847
01:33:29,940 --> 01:33:30,900
Like, the...

2848
01:33:30,900 --> 01:33:31,840
Um...

2849
01:33:32,600 --> 01:33:33,480
What was it?

2850
01:33:33,560 --> 01:33:34,880
One of the Na'vi or whatever.

2851
01:33:35,160 --> 01:33:37,840
And then, like, that was, like, the only good portion.

2852
01:33:38,420 --> 01:33:38,980
Um...

2853
01:33:38,980 --> 01:33:40,580
The only good portion.

2854
01:33:40,680 --> 01:33:42,820
It's actually a very popular world.

2855
01:33:42,920 --> 01:33:48,420
I would feel like the Star Wars world, um, is more popular than Pandora.

2856
01:33:48,520 --> 01:33:52,260
Like, nobody really talks about, like, Pandora.

2857
01:33:52,480 --> 01:33:54,540
I feel like...

2858
01:33:54,540 --> 01:33:59,140
I feel like nobody really talks about the world of Pandora.

2859
01:33:59,160 --> 01:33:59,920
I don't even know.

2860
01:33:59,920 --> 01:34:00,720
I don't even know the lore.

2861
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:01,220
Like...

2862
01:34:01,220 --> 01:34:05,200
I barely know the lore about the world of Pandora.

2863
01:34:05,480 --> 01:34:06,000
Like...

2864
01:34:06,700 --> 01:34:07,600
What the fuck?

2865
01:34:07,620 --> 01:34:08,880
It's the world where...

2866
01:34:09,560 --> 01:34:12,600
The only reason why I remember Pandora is because...

2867
01:34:12,600 --> 01:34:17,780
Okay, to be fair, like, they already milked Star Wars so hard that, like, it's dead now.

2868
01:34:18,060 --> 01:34:18,500
Um...

2869
01:34:18,500 --> 01:34:19,840
But other than that, like...

2870
01:34:19,840 --> 01:34:20,040
Like...

2871
01:34:26,240 --> 01:34:28,060
I just feel like...

2872
01:34:28,060 --> 01:34:29,040
I just feel like...

2873
01:34:29,040 --> 01:34:29,800
Nobody really...

2874
01:34:29,800 --> 01:34:29,900
I just feel like...

2875
01:34:29,900 --> 01:34:31,900
I don't even know what the second movie is about.

2876
01:34:32,080 --> 01:34:32,980
Like, I don't even...

2877
01:34:32,980 --> 01:34:34,680
And then they're making a third movie.

2878
01:34:34,820 --> 01:34:37,300
I know, like, the second movie is about, like...

2879
01:34:37,300 --> 01:34:38,040
What was his name?

2880
01:34:38,160 --> 01:34:38,480
Jake?

2881
01:34:38,760 --> 01:34:39,620
That's his name, right?

2882
01:34:39,700 --> 01:34:41,060
Jake's kids or whatever.

2883
01:34:41,300 --> 01:34:42,060
But, like, that's the...

2884
01:34:42,060 --> 01:34:43,260
I didn't even watch the second movie.

2885
01:34:43,420 --> 01:34:47,680
I watched the first movie because at that time it was, like, FOMO and everybody watches...

2886
01:34:47,680 --> 01:34:50,460
Everybody, um, watched Avatar.

2887
01:34:51,460 --> 01:34:51,860
Um...

2888
01:34:51,860 --> 01:34:55,960
I liked how because, like, Disney got Avatar...

2889
01:34:55,960 --> 01:34:58,960
That they copyrighted trademarked Avatar...

2890
01:34:58,960 --> 01:35:02,300
That Avatar the Last Airbender cannot be called Avatar.

2891
01:35:02,640 --> 01:35:04,080
Only Avatar anymore.

2892
01:35:04,240 --> 01:35:08,240
They have to be called Avatar the Last Airbender because Disney trademarked Avatar.

2893
01:35:08,780 --> 01:35:11,600
I think that's pretty funny.

2894
01:35:14,420 --> 01:35:15,240
Oh, my God.

2895
01:35:18,660 --> 01:35:19,180
Um...

2896
01:35:19,180 --> 01:35:19,980
But, yeah.

2897
01:35:20,040 --> 01:35:20,320
I...

2898
01:35:20,320 --> 01:35:20,840
I don't know.

2899
01:35:20,900 --> 01:35:21,680
I just feel like...

2900
01:35:21,680 --> 01:35:23,720
I feel like Pandora was just...

2901
01:35:23,720 --> 01:35:24,240
I don't know.

2902
01:35:24,300 --> 01:35:27,200
I just feel like Pandora is not, like, a cool world to have.

2903
01:35:27,460 --> 01:35:28,040
Like, I...

2904
01:35:28,040 --> 01:35:29,040
There's so many...

2905
01:35:29,040 --> 01:35:33,240
Like, there's so many, like, so cool Disney world...

2906
01:35:33,580 --> 01:35:38,380
Like, Disney, like, worlds they can, like, make into, like, an area.

2907
01:35:39,280 --> 01:35:39,840
Um...

2908
01:35:39,840 --> 01:35:41,740
And the fact that, like...

2909
01:35:41,740 --> 01:35:45,160
I just feel like Pandora is just not, like, the best choice...

2910
01:35:45,860 --> 01:35:47,000
Like, to have.

2911
01:35:47,460 --> 01:35:48,020
Like...

2912
01:35:50,760 --> 01:35:51,660
It's just...

2913
01:35:51,660 --> 01:35:52,680
I feel like...

2914
01:35:52,680 --> 01:35:57,200
Like, immersion-wise, they could have chose anything else for immersion-wise.

2915
01:35:57,200 --> 01:36:00,160
I just didn't think Pandora was the right choice.

2916
01:36:00,480 --> 01:36:02,060
I felt like they could have picked anything else.

2917
01:36:02,560 --> 01:36:03,060
Um...

2918
01:36:04,320 --> 01:36:04,960
Let's see.

2919
01:36:05,100 --> 01:36:05,820
What else do I...

2920
01:36:05,820 --> 01:36:06,020
Okay.

2921
01:36:06,200 --> 01:36:06,700
Before...

2922
01:36:06,700 --> 01:36:07,580
I'm sorry.

2923
01:36:07,660 --> 01:36:09,700
I'm roasting everything regarding Disney.

2924
01:36:09,920 --> 01:36:11,620
I love Disney, by the way.

2925
01:36:11,800 --> 01:36:13,060
Like, I love their movies.

2926
01:36:13,460 --> 01:36:14,840
I love...

2927
01:36:17,220 --> 01:36:17,720
I...

2928
01:36:18,880 --> 01:36:19,880
I love their...

2929
01:36:19,880 --> 01:36:21,140
I love their movies.

2930
01:36:21,420 --> 01:36:23,040
Well, their old movies.

2931
01:36:23,180 --> 01:36:23,500
Their...

2932
01:36:23,500 --> 01:36:24,120
Their classics.

2933
01:36:24,440 --> 01:36:26,480
Their classic animated films.

2934
01:36:26,480 --> 01:36:29,180
Like, we don't talk about current Disney.

2935
01:36:29,440 --> 01:36:31,840
But, I like their classic films.

2936
01:36:32,240 --> 01:36:32,840
But...

2937
01:36:33,300 --> 01:36:36,780
Like, I have to criticize it because it's just not the same anymore.

2938
01:36:37,080 --> 01:36:37,560
It's...

2939
01:36:37,560 --> 01:36:39,700
It's just not the same anymore.

2940
01:36:41,040 --> 01:36:41,640
Um...

2941
01:36:41,640 --> 01:36:42,120
It's...

2942
01:36:42,120 --> 01:36:47,340
The reason why I'm so passionate about, like, some of my hate towards the stuff they do...

2943
01:36:47,340 --> 01:36:50,340
Is because I love Disney so much that I...

2944
01:36:50,340 --> 01:36:52,340
I don't like how...

2945
01:36:52,340 --> 01:36:54,300
What modern Disney has become.

2946
01:36:54,600 --> 01:36:56,460
Also, fuck Disney for shutting down Disney.

2947
01:36:56,460 --> 01:36:56,540
I don't like?

2948
01:37:01,200 --> 01:37:08,020
Well, Disney is amazing...

2949
01:37:08,700 --> 01:37:13,080
Yeah, well you know, I don't like theDisney eats, like...

2950
01:37:13,080 --> 01:37:14,920
You know that Disney is the best in this country.

2951
01:37:14,940 --> 01:37:15,040
You know this is the movie made of only...

2952
01:37:15,040 --> 01:37:15,060
Yeah, sure, it's a fucking shit movie.

2953
01:37:15,060 --> 01:37:15,580
But it's, you know...

2954
01:37:15,580 --> 01:37:16,400
It's so good.

2955
01:37:16,500 --> 01:37:16,560
But, yeah.

2956
01:37:16,560 --> 01:37:20,920
dor Europa, this is the worst movie I have ever seen.

2957
01:37:21,040 --> 01:37:21,660
I mean, seriously.

2958
01:37:21,660 --> 01:37:22,460
Oh God, oh God.

2959
01:37:22,460 --> 01:37:22,560
You know this...

2960
01:37:22,560 --> 01:37:23,320
The one thing that justしく changed my opinion is...

2961
01:37:23,320 --> 01:37:23,440
Well.

2962
01:37:24,300 --> 01:37:25,580
That Schwangerran will be.

2963
01:37:25,580 --> 01:37:26,600
I would always be mad.

2964
01:37:27,720 --> 01:37:29,180
I would be mad.

2965
01:37:34,160 --> 01:37:35,960
Oh my god, there was something else I wanted to talk about.

2966
01:37:36,180 --> 01:37:36,840
Is it about Disney?

2967
01:37:36,960 --> 01:37:38,240
Oh yeah, it's about amusement parks.

2968
01:37:38,420 --> 01:37:39,860
I know, like I said, I'm going to end it here.

2969
01:37:40,620 --> 01:37:44,740
But did you guys see that they're going to make a Dragon Ball Z world?

2970
01:37:45,060 --> 01:37:50,860
But I thought the funniest shit was that it's not going to be in Japan, but it's going to be in, like, Saudi Arabia.

2971
01:37:50,860 --> 01:37:57,920
I thought... The fact that, like, the Dragon Ball Z... Yeah, they're going to make Dragon...

2972
01:37:57,920 --> 01:38:01,740
They're going to make an amusement park based off of Dragon Ball Z.

2973
01:38:01,960 --> 01:38:03,900
Like, literally based off...

2974
01:38:03,900 --> 01:38:06,060
It's going to be in Saudi Arabia.

2975
01:38:06,440 --> 01:38:10,480
And, like, it's so crazy because they're... You know where it's going to be?

2976
01:38:10,680 --> 01:38:12,600
They're going to carve the desert.

2977
01:38:13,080 --> 01:38:19,740
I was so... They're going to fucking carve the desert to fit...

2978
01:38:20,900 --> 01:38:27,560
Like, to fit... Yeah, they're going to... It was... It was in... It was in...

2979
01:38:28,740 --> 01:38:32,900
It was... I saw it on a YouTube short and it was like...

2980
01:38:33,780 --> 01:38:36,720
Yeah, they're... Because it's not just going to be... Okay, wait.

2981
01:38:36,800 --> 01:38:37,920
I need to, like, look at...

2982
01:38:37,920 --> 01:38:40,680
I saw it on a YouTube short and I was like, what the fuck?

2983
01:38:41,080 --> 01:38:42,460
There's no way.

2984
01:38:43,460 --> 01:38:49,380
It's going to be... It's going to be in fucking Saudi Arabia?

2985
01:38:50,100 --> 01:38:50,600
Like...

2986
01:38:53,200 --> 01:38:55,240
I was so surprised.

2987
01:38:55,820 --> 01:38:57,440
I was like, here, here's the teaser.

2988
01:38:57,560 --> 01:38:58,360
I saw the teaser.

2989
01:38:58,500 --> 01:39:00,500
So, they released the teaser for it.

2990
01:39:03,460 --> 01:39:04,780
And this was it.

2991
01:39:04,940 --> 01:39:05,460
Is it this?

2992
01:39:06,080 --> 01:39:06,660
Oh, yeah.

2993
01:39:06,740 --> 01:39:08,420
So, this is basically...

2994
01:39:10,520 --> 01:39:13,000
This is a teaser for the world.

2995
01:39:13,320 --> 01:39:14,460
And it's not just that.

2996
01:39:14,580 --> 01:39:15,560
There was, like...

2997
01:39:16,240 --> 01:39:17,360
There's, like, so many.

2998
01:39:17,560 --> 01:39:20,240
They're planning on making, like, different...

2999
01:39:20,240 --> 01:39:20,820
Oh, yeah.

3000
01:39:20,880 --> 01:39:22,400
They're making a Six Flags, too.

3001
01:39:22,640 --> 01:39:26,540
They're making a... They're making a Six Flags.

3002
01:39:26,860 --> 01:39:30,300
Oh, it's going to be next to the Dragon Ball Z world.

3003
01:39:33,480 --> 01:39:36,700
Because they're working on Six Flags right now.

3004
01:39:36,780 --> 01:39:38,420
They're working on that right now.

3005
01:39:38,480 --> 01:39:45,360
And then after Six Flags, they're going to work on... They're going to do the Dragon Ball Z area.

3006
01:39:45,780 --> 01:39:48,580
But I thought it was so funny that, like...

3007
01:39:48,580 --> 01:39:56,660
Six Flags is going to be in Saudi Arabia next to the Dragon Ball theme park.

3008
01:39:56,900 --> 01:39:58,560
I just thought that was so interesting.

3009
01:39:59,080 --> 01:40:01,520
Yeah, there's going to be a Six Flags.

3010
01:40:03,620 --> 01:40:04,600
Yeah, anyway.

3011
01:40:04,860 --> 01:40:06,600
Why not make the world a Kingdom Hearts?

3012
01:40:06,820 --> 01:40:08,280
Oh, they're dressing up as...

3013
01:40:09,800 --> 01:40:13,520
They're dressing up as Kingdom Hearts right now.

3014
01:40:13,760 --> 01:40:17,780
And then some... I saw somebody on Twitter, like, posted a picture of it.

3015
01:40:17,780 --> 01:40:21,040
Because they didn't know... They don't understand Kingdom Hearts.

3016
01:40:21,220 --> 01:40:23,040
And they're like, why did they give Mickey a sword?

3017
01:40:23,540 --> 01:40:25,780
I saw that on Twitter.

3018
01:40:25,880 --> 01:40:26,680
It's so funny.

3019
01:40:26,880 --> 01:40:30,240
Because every Halloween, they bring out Kingdom Hearts.

3020
01:40:32,420 --> 01:40:37,880
They bring out Kingdom Hearts during Halloween for Disneyland.

3021
01:40:38,360 --> 01:40:41,040
And so, like, they dress them up.

3022
01:40:41,140 --> 01:40:43,860
So, like, you know, Donald, Goofy, and Mickey, and Sora.

3023
01:40:44,080 --> 01:40:45,540
We don't talk about the Sora.

3024
01:40:46,300 --> 01:40:47,340
The Sora...

3025
01:40:47,340 --> 01:40:47,820
Oh, my God.

3026
01:40:47,840 --> 01:40:48,560
Sora looks...

3027
01:40:48,560 --> 01:40:56,780
Because, like, the thing is, for Sora, for Kingdom Hearts meet and greets in Disneyland or Disney World, they may give him, like...

3028
01:40:57,340 --> 01:40:58,220
It's not...

3029
01:40:59,200 --> 01:41:00,660
They make him a mascot.

3030
01:41:02,080 --> 01:41:03,560
It's so ugly.

3031
01:41:05,060 --> 01:41:06,840
It's so ugly.

3032
01:41:08,200 --> 01:41:09,240
It's actually...

3033
01:41:09,240 --> 01:41:11,200
They don't make him, like, a person.

3034
01:41:11,460 --> 01:41:12,980
They give him, like...

3035
01:41:12,980 --> 01:41:13,780
This is what...

3036
01:41:13,780 --> 01:41:14,540
Okay, I'll show you guys.

3037
01:41:14,740 --> 01:41:15,080
Like...

3038
01:41:18,220 --> 01:41:19,220
I don't know.

3039
01:41:19,340 --> 01:41:19,800
It looks...

3040
01:41:19,800 --> 01:41:21,460
It's just so...

3041
01:41:22,620 --> 01:41:23,060
Uncanny.

3042
01:41:23,340 --> 01:41:23,720
It's...

3043
01:41:23,720 --> 01:41:25,980
It's so uncanny.

3044
01:41:26,100 --> 01:41:27,400
I can't...

3045
01:41:28,200 --> 01:41:29,360
It's so weird.

3046
01:41:29,560 --> 01:41:30,960
I don't like it.

3047
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:32,380
It's so weird.

3048
01:41:32,940 --> 01:41:34,220
Okay, I'll show you guys a picture.

3049
01:41:35,580 --> 01:41:37,560
I don't think they bring him out anymore.

3050
01:41:37,700 --> 01:41:39,040
Because people complain too much.

3051
01:41:39,400 --> 01:41:42,080
People were like, no, he's too much of a freak right now.

3052
01:41:42,100 --> 01:41:43,560
Like, we shouldn't bring him out anymore.

3053
01:41:44,760 --> 01:41:45,200
Whatever.

3054
01:41:45,260 --> 01:41:46,300
Did I download it?

3055
01:41:46,400 --> 01:41:47,320
Oh, did I not download it?

3056
01:41:47,940 --> 01:41:48,740
Where did I...

3057
01:41:48,740 --> 01:41:50,160
Oh, I put it in my thumbnails.

3058
01:41:50,400 --> 01:41:52,560
Oh my gosh, I'm going to delete that after...

3059
01:41:54,080 --> 01:41:55,500
I put it in my thumbnails.

3060
01:41:55,700 --> 01:41:56,800
This is what he looks like.

3061
01:41:58,500 --> 01:42:00,100
He looks a little freaky.

3062
01:42:02,640 --> 01:42:04,600
Like, it's just so uncanny.

3063
01:42:04,660 --> 01:42:05,820
Just make him a real...

3064
01:42:05,820 --> 01:42:07,720
Just give him a fake...

3065
01:42:07,720 --> 01:42:08,420
Like, I don't know.

3066
01:42:08,440 --> 01:42:09,780
Just don't put a mask on him.

3067
01:42:10,020 --> 01:42:10,660
Let's go...

3068
01:42:10,660 --> 01:42:12,400
Speaking of Halloween, though.

3069
01:42:12,620 --> 01:42:13,900
Did you guys know, like...

3070
01:42:14,680 --> 01:42:17,220
You can be a skibbity toilet now for...

3071
01:42:17,220 --> 01:42:17,300
I don't know.

3072
01:42:17,300 --> 01:42:17,660
But for like...

3073
01:42:17,660 --> 01:42:18,380
What was it called?

3074
01:42:18,460 --> 01:42:19,400
The Halloween store?

3075
01:42:19,620 --> 01:42:22,260
The Halloween popup store?

3076
01:42:22,640 --> 01:42:23,680
Oh, my God.

3077
01:42:27,100 --> 01:42:28,220
Spirit Halloween!

3078
01:42:28,940 --> 01:42:29,620
Oh, my.

3079
01:42:29,640 --> 01:42:32,500
There's some crazy costumes at spirit Halloween now!

3080
01:42:32,720 --> 01:42:33,160
Yeah.

3081
01:42:33,200 --> 01:42:33,420
No.

3082
01:42:33,560 --> 01:42:33,840
You...

3083
01:42:33,840 --> 01:42:38,720
There's some fucking crazy costumes at spirit Halloween!

3084
01:42:39,240 --> 01:42:41,380
But some of them, I was...

3085
01:42:41,380 --> 01:42:42,500
I was not...

3086
01:42:42,500 --> 01:42:43,020
Okay.

3087
01:42:43,160 --> 01:42:43,880
I was...

3088
01:42:43,880 --> 01:42:47,020
I was very surprised that some of the stuff...

3089
01:42:47,020 --> 01:42:52,840
Oh yeah, by the way, like, you can... the amazing digital circus is in it, too.

3090
01:42:53,320 --> 01:43:00,860
Um... the amazing... they have costumes from the amazing digital circus.

3091
01:43:01,380 --> 01:43:08,760
I... it's just crazy to think about that, like, stuff like these are costumes now.

3092
01:43:08,960 --> 01:43:10,480
Like, no, it's true!

3093
01:43:10,880 --> 01:43:12,260
I saw it on Twitter.

3094
01:43:12,700 --> 01:43:13,940
It's true.

3095
01:43:13,940 --> 01:43:17,500
I wish I was joking.

3096
01:43:19,180 --> 01:43:20,780
Let me see if I can find it.

3097
01:43:20,900 --> 01:43:21,900
I'm gonna see if I can find it.

3098
01:43:22,220 --> 01:43:23,160
Um, alright.

3099
01:43:23,320 --> 01:43:25,300
I'm looking at Spirit Halloween right now.

3100
01:43:26,600 --> 01:43:30,440
It was literally, like, someone took a picture of it, and I was like, what the fuck?

3101
01:43:30,940 --> 01:43:33,640
There's no... I was like, what the fuck?

3102
01:43:36,320 --> 01:43:37,540
This is real.

3103
01:43:40,980 --> 01:43:42,900
Let me see if I can find it.

3104
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:43,860
Oh yeah, they...

3105
01:43:43,940 --> 01:43:49,000
Wait, they have... wait, they have a Nezuko costume at Spirit Halloween?

3106
01:43:50,280 --> 01:43:51,840
Holy fuck, okay.

3107
01:43:52,240 --> 01:43:53,760
I mean, good for you.

3108
01:43:53,940 --> 01:43:54,920
Good on, I guess.

3109
01:43:54,940 --> 01:43:57,200
Good for you for the branding and everything.

3110
01:43:57,680 --> 01:43:59,780
Is that the only anime thing they have?

3111
01:44:00,140 --> 01:44:01,080
There's no way.

3112
01:44:01,260 --> 01:44:02,120
What, really?

3113
01:44:03,260 --> 01:44:04,560
Oh my god, it is.

3114
01:44:04,680 --> 01:44:06,760
It's, like, the only anime thing they...

3115
01:44:06,760 --> 01:44:09,000
Oh my god, you keep picking something!

3116
01:44:13,480 --> 01:44:15,300
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!

3117
01:44:15,300 --> 01:44:15,420
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!

3118
01:44:15,420 --> 01:44:16,840
Why is that there?

3119
01:44:17,220 --> 01:44:24,820
Why is... why is the Fal'Guard Sonic the Hedgehog in there?

3120
01:44:26,780 --> 01:44:28,840
Oh my god.

3121
01:44:29,420 --> 01:44:31,360
Okay, that one was good.

3122
01:44:31,600 --> 01:44:32,380
That one...

3123
01:44:32,380 --> 01:44:35,900
I did not expect that to be a costume, not gonna lie.

3124
01:44:35,900 --> 01:44:40,160
I... I was not... I was not expecting that.

3125
01:44:41,020 --> 01:44:41,500
Um...

3126
01:44:42,740 --> 01:44:46,500
Like, for Fall guys too, like that's so specific.

3127
01:44:47,160 --> 01:44:49,660
That is such a specific costume.

3128
01:44:49,940 --> 01:44:50,800
Oh, there it is.

3129
01:44:50,840 --> 01:44:51,440
I found it.

3130
01:44:51,980 --> 01:44:53,020
I found it.

3131
01:44:53,040 --> 01:44:53,540
Here you go.

3132
01:44:54,640 --> 01:44:55,620
Here you go, guys.

3133
01:44:55,940 --> 01:44:58,960
For those who wanted to know what that looked like, don't worry, I got you guys.

3134
01:44:59,360 --> 01:45:03,020
It's called Kid's Inflatable Skibbity Toilet Costume.

3135
01:45:03,140 --> 01:45:05,360
It's literally in Spirit Halloween right now.

3136
01:45:05,360 --> 01:45:07,500
I've even posted... Okay, let's see.

3137
01:45:07,860 --> 01:45:10,040
I'll put it up on screen too for you guys.

3138
01:45:10,120 --> 01:45:11,240
Just for all of you guys.

3139
01:45:12,060 --> 01:45:12,620
Alright.

3140
01:45:18,240 --> 01:45:19,360
Okay, look.

3141
01:45:26,960 --> 01:45:29,680
This is a Halloween costume now.

3142
01:45:30,140 --> 01:45:31,220
Holy shit.

3143
01:45:31,640 --> 01:45:37,020
We live in the timeline where this is a Halloween costume.

3144
01:45:40,040 --> 01:45:40,480
Alright.

3145
01:45:41,220 --> 01:45:42,940
I'm calling it for real now.

3146
01:45:43,240 --> 01:45:45,180
Oh, I found this one's pretty funny too.

3147
01:45:45,460 --> 01:45:48,320
Okay, before I call it for real, I thought this was a...

3148
01:45:48,320 --> 01:45:49,820
This was a very silly costume.

3149
01:45:50,220 --> 01:45:50,460
I...

3150
01:45:50,460 --> 01:45:56,680
I thought this was pretty funny.

3151
01:45:58,200 --> 01:46:01,440
It's called Adult Bee Stinger Costume.

3152
01:46:02,140 --> 01:46:02,580
Um...

3153
01:46:02,580 --> 01:46:04,640
Alright, I'm calling it for real this time.

3154
01:46:04,880 --> 01:46:06,480
I just want to end it with that costume.

3155
01:46:06,480 --> 01:46:07,720
Because I thought it was pretty silly.

3156
01:46:08,360 --> 01:46:08,760
Um...

3157
01:46:09,480 --> 01:46:11,460
Because Halloween is coming up.

3158
01:46:11,760 --> 01:46:12,540
Anyway, guys.

3159
01:46:12,860 --> 01:46:13,980
Alright, I'm going to call it here.

3160
01:46:14,240 --> 01:46:15,980
It's fun chatting with you guys as always.

3161
01:46:16,140 --> 01:46:17,340
I love hanging out with my dragons.

3162
01:46:17,580 --> 01:46:18,400
And just...

3163
01:46:18,880 --> 01:46:19,280
Uh...

3164
01:46:19,280 --> 01:46:21,400
And just like talking with you guys.

3165
01:46:21,520 --> 01:46:22,720
And having...

3166
01:46:22,720 --> 01:46:23,740
Thanks, Toki.

3167
01:46:23,820 --> 01:46:24,500
I hate it.

3168
01:46:24,540 --> 01:46:24,940
I hate it.

3169
01:46:25,340 --> 01:46:27,080
Thank you for the super chat, Mr. Tooth.

3170
01:46:27,120 --> 01:46:27,460
Thank you.

3171
01:46:27,500 --> 01:46:28,100
Thank you.

3172
01:46:28,660 --> 01:46:29,060
Um...

3173
01:46:29,060 --> 01:46:30,680
But I always love chatting with you guys.

3174
01:46:30,840 --> 01:46:32,420
I hope you guys enjoyed talking with me.

3175
01:46:32,520 --> 01:46:33,300
Yapping with me.

3176
01:46:33,560 --> 01:46:33,960
Uh...

3177
01:46:33,960 --> 01:46:35,320
I went through a bunch of topics.

3178
01:46:35,740 --> 01:46:36,100
Um...

3179
01:46:36,100 --> 01:46:38,420
So I hope you guys had a great rest of your day.

3180
01:46:38,560 --> 01:46:40,400
Or a good night for you guys.

3181
01:46:40,580 --> 01:46:42,640
Or a good morning for those who are just waking up.

3182
01:46:42,740 --> 01:46:44,820
As always, everybody stay hydrated.

3183
01:46:45,460 --> 01:46:46,000
Posture check.

3184
01:46:46,040 --> 01:46:47,640
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

3185
01:46:47,820 --> 01:46:49,700
And if you stay up for me, head to bed.

3186
01:46:49,940 --> 01:46:51,220
Because you deserve it.

3187
01:46:51,360 --> 01:46:52,440
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

3188
01:46:53,020 --> 01:46:53,780
Bye, guys.

3189
01:46:54,500 --> 01:46:54,860
Bye.
