1
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:39,060
It's time for the moment you've been waiting for.

2
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:30,520
I

3
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:48,940
can go pretty low.

4
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,400
Excuse me.

5
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:20,360
Preparing the outfit reveal.

6
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,120
Yee-haw.

7
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:30,220
I mean, what were you guys expecting?

8
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,940
This is my true form, guys.

9
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,760
And I have a hat now.

10
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,360
Oh my god.

11
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,700
Is this height?

12
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,740
I also have like... my hat has physics too.

13
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:43,560
Woah.

14
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:46,640
Anyway.

15
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:48,900
I mean, I also have this hat too.

16
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:53,180
Okay, okay, okay.

17
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:53,680
Alright.

18
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:54,640
Sorry.

19
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:55,500
Anyway.

20
00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:00,880
Presenting the real skinsuit debut.

21
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,600
Here is your champion.

22
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,420
Landing in Thadwood Canyon.

23
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:26,700
Round one.

24
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:32,920
First blood.

25
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,780
Now, time to fuck some dudes.

26
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:32,250
Oish.

27
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:33,290
Nice table.

28
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:38,750
Well, if the price is right, I'll do it alright.

29
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:40,070
Awww.

30
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:46,550
I'm a good guy.

31
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:46,650
Fuck you.

32
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:42,690
I'm a good guy.

33
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:43,410
I'm a good guy.

34
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:44,330
I'm

35
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:08,360
a good guy.

36
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:38,440
I'm the best.

37
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:38,780
I'm a good guy.

38
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:39,080
I'm such an asshole.

39
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:39,600
I get it, man.

40
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:39,680
That's a good name.

41
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:39,860
That's a good one.

42
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:44,520
You're a real good guy.

43
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,000
Yeah.

44
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:50,220
That's what I wanted to do down to.

45
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:50,260
How is it?

46
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:52,980
This is a crazy cool thing.

47
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,640
I

48
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:06,620
love this song.

49
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:07,060
So easy.

50
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:14,660
Oh yay!

51
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,880
Congratulations!

52
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:20,340
Dragoons!

53
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:23,580
You paid us!

54
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:26,440
$60 to unlock me!

55
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:28,820
Yes, me.

56
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:32,340
Alright.

57
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:39,000
Now you know why we went through six loops today.

58
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:45,080
You finally did it, Dragoons!

59
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:46,980
You've unlocked me.

60
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:48,960
The newest update.

61
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:52,720
The newest character in BattleBirds.

62
00:21:57,630 --> 00:21:59,410
What do you mean scammed?

63
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:00,930
How could you say that?

64
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:02,290
It's me!

65
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:04,170
It's worth it.

66
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:04,710
I swear.

67
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:05,530
It's worth it.

68
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:14,290
We all know when a new character gets released, it's like super OP and then they nerf it later after making people buy the character.

69
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:22,530
Because it has to be super OP so that people will spend $60 to buy to unlock the character because they want to win.

70
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:25,990
It's like a It's just pure scam.

71
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:26,650
It's pure capitalism.

72
00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:36,750
But congratulations on spending that $60 guys.

73
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:38,230
Congratulations.

74
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:44,030
I need you to scroll me up though.

75
00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:45,950
Oh, check out my boots.

76
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:49,350
Like that little shiny tints and little spurs.

77
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:50,550
Yeehaw.

78
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:55,350
I'm your Canadian cowboy.

79
00:22:55,770 --> 00:22:57,350
I'm your Canadian cowboy.

80
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:05,180
Anyway, I guess we could move a little bit higher I guess.

81
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:06,300
Nothing really.

82
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:09,800
I don't know if anything is exciting as we get higher.

83
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,060
It's just legs.

84
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:15,780
It's legs from here.

85
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:16,600
It's legs from here.

86
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:19,060
But then we have the hand.

87
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:20,180
Woah.

88
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:21,800
You see?

89
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:24,720
You see how my hand fingers move too?

90
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:25,480
Guys?

91
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:26,680
Woah.

92
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:27,220
Oh yeah.

93
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:29,600
I can like bounce up and down as well.

94
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:30,660
Look at that.

95
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:31,620
Hahahaha.

96
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:33,420
Hahahaha.

97
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:37,400
I can move my hands too.

98
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:40,380
Oh and then my little belt is dangling.

99
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:41,700
Oh my gosh.

100
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:42,500
I don't know why.

101
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:47,300
I feel like I'm like, well technically I am sort of like re-debuting again.

102
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:48,320
Hahahaha.

103
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:51,120
How many?

104
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:55,520
How many re-debuts am I going to get?

105
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:55,860
God.

106
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:56,660
Hahahaha.

107
00:23:59,180 --> 00:23:59,700
Yes.

108
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:01,420
Look at that.

109
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:02,580
Look at my belt.

110
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:04,000
Oh and the shadow too.

111
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:09,780
I need to make sure I don't accidentally press the wrong button.

112
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:17,040
Because like, if I press... there's a button here that I press that will take me straight to my face.

113
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:19,580
And like, I don't want to accidentally press that.

114
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:19,980
So...

115
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,140
I'm laughing more because I'm more nervous.

116
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:25,120
Hahahaha.

117
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:27,760
Hahahaha.

118
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:28,840
But yes.

119
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:33,900
You might see my color palette changed a little bit too.

120
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:35,580
So...

121
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:40,480
Oh and you might see an aviator as well at the top.

122
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,940
Alright, let's hope that I don't fuck this up.

123
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:44,340
But... Yeah!

124
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:45,720
Hahahaha.

125
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,560
I have a gun now.

126
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:52,960
But if like, uh, YouTube was like, no guns allowed, don't worry.

127
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:55,840
I can... I can hide it so they won't know.

128
00:24:56,120 --> 00:25:00,860
If like, if I get striked by the TOS because I have a gun, I'll just be like...

129
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:02,220
I'll just be like, boop.

130
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:03,180
Hahahaha.

131
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:06,040
Hahahaha.

132
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:06,540
Yes.

133
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:09,660
Being a bounty hunter is hard work, guys.

134
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,200
I do have, uh...

135
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,820
I have scars on my...

136
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:13,860
on my other arm.

137
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:14,760
On my right arm.

138
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:15,900
Um...

139
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:17,120
Yes.

140
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:18,780
I also have a little...

141
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:20,700
a little belt here too.

142
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:23,440
To hold all my ammo because I always need light ammo.

143
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:24,660
Um...

144
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:28,780
I don't know why my main gun of choice is a deagle though.

145
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:32,340
Uh... Because we all know like... Hahahaha.

146
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:36,520
I'm not really good with the, uh...

147
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:37,520
the Doki Wing.

148
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,700
I'm not... I'm not the best at the Doki Wing.

149
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:40,380
So...

150
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:43,680
Um... It is a little awkward that that's my choice of gun.

151
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:45,140
But that means...

152
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:46,460
That means I'll get better!

153
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:48,460
The more I practice...

154
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:51,320
The better I'm going... Okay, it's not a deagle.

155
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:51,620
Sorry.

156
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:53,040
It's... Uh...

157
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:53,560
Hahaha.

158
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:55,000
It's a revol...

159
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:55,900
I'm sorry, guys.

160
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:56,680
It's a revolver.

161
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:57,140
Look!

162
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:59,340
I don't know much about gun names.

163
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:00,820
I just know gun...

164
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:03,920
I can... I can shoot the gun and people die.

165
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:04,720
That's it.

166
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:04,960
Look!

167
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:08,200
You paid... You did buy the collector's edition for the bounty hunter.

168
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,200
That's on you.

169
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:10,560
Uh... Hahaha.

170
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,000
Hahaha.

171
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:17,080
The... The collector's edition of...

172
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:23,760
Uh... The collector's edition of the bounty hunter would include a bounty hunter that knows the gun names.

173
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:25,440
But you went the cheap route.

174
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:30,340
You went for the $60 uh... standard edition of the bounty hunter.

175
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:32,580
That's why you only have one skin.

176
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:33,340
Okay?

177
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:42,520
You only have... If you bought the collector's edition uh... of the bounty hunter, the debut bounty hunter skin, you would have got the rare skin.

178
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:48,280
And that rare skin... That rare Doki bird bounty hunter skin would have known the gun names.

179
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:49,300
Hahaha.

180
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:50,800
Hahaha.

181
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:56,920
That Doki bird would have known the different gun names.

182
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:57,460
Okay?

183
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:00,160
She would have known the gun that she was carrying.

184
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,880
Uh... Joke's on you guys.

185
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,740
You can't... You can't refund this.

186
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,040
You can't.

187
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:06,600
Hahaha.

188
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:07,320
Hahaha.

189
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,180
And the T... Joke's on you.

190
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,640
This isn't Steam.

191
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:12,720
Hahaha.

192
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,560
It's Doki verse.

193
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:17,940
Doki verse does not provide any refunds.

194
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:19,960
So you will not get any refunds.

195
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:22,640
You like how I'm stalling so I won't let you guys see my face?

196
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,420
Cause I'm building up the anticipation.

197
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,880
You're like, what does she look like?

198
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:27,700
Hahaha.

199
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:29,780
Hahaha.

200
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:31,920
Whoa!

201
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:37,260
Alright, let me move like one centimeter more and then go on with my tangent.

202
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:38,860
Anyway, uh...

203
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:39,360
Hahaha.

204
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:41,140
Yes.

205
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:42,360
Um...

206
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:46,120
You guys knew what you were gonna get in the Doki verse chat.

207
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:49,520
Doki verse chat does not provide any refunds.

208
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:51,480
What you buy is what you get.

209
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:52,320
Hahaha.

210
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:54,180
Yes!

211
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,220
I have a bandana now.

212
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:58,420
I actually used to have a bandana.

213
00:27:58,500 --> 00:27:59,100
You know what I'm gonna say?

214
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:01,360
It's like a... Uh...

215
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:06,480
It's basically like a build up of my past, present, into a future.

216
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:12,380
Uh... When my very first skin suit actually wore a bandana.

217
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,440
Just like this.

218
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:14,940
So, uh...

219
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,520
This is like basically...

220
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:24,160
Um... Basically a tribute to my very fir... One of my... My very first skin suit had a bandana just like this.

221
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:28,460
Well, not just like this, but it was like similar colors and similar design.

222
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:30,680
Um...

223
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:31,920
Okay, anyway.

224
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:33,140
Uh...

225
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:36,540

241
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:03,760
Hahaha!

Everything... It's like I could have like, you know, a sports bra.

00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:20,780
You don't know that?

Hello, hello!

Yes!

358
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:36,600
This is what I look... This is my newest skin suit.

359
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:38,000
The Bounty Hunter.

360
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:39,300
Um...

00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:40,480
Okay.

00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:41,340
So, like...

363
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:43,480
I'm not used to be...

364
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,620
being so fluid and...

365
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:47,060
uh... articulated.

366
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:48,180
Hahaha!

00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:54,760
Actually, no.

372
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,120
I've never had that experience before.

373
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,220
I've never...

374
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:59,260
I've never experienced...

375
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:03,180
like... being able to move so much in general, to be fair.

376
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:03,860
Hahaha!

377
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:05,540

Okay.

380
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:09,940
So... Um...

381
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:10,980
One of my...

382
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:13,000
favorite features here...

383
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,840
for this one... is that...

384
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:15,740
I can do this.

385
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:19,360
Hahaha!

386
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:20,680
Hahaha!

387
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:22,700
I...

388
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:25,400
I love... I love this expression the most.

389
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:27,580
Hahaha!

390
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,820
And... and...

391
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:34,600
Of course, I specifically requested that...

392
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:37,400
uh... I wanted this face too.

393
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:42,680
Hahaha!

394
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:44,260
Hahaha!

395
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:44,860
Okay.

396
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:46,140
Hahaha!

397
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,040
So, yes.

398
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,780
The smug is still there.

399
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,900
The smug is...

400
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:53,200
is still there.

401
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:54,000
But!

402
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,760
I also have...

403
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,960
a million different emotions.

404
00:33:58,740 --> 00:33:59,520
Uh...

405
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:00,640
that I can do.

406
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:01,420
So...

407
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:02,040
Oh!

408
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:03,380
Yes!

409
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:04,840
How could I forget?

410
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:07,340
We've... The best...

411
00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:10,520
Um... The best member on this channel...

412
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:11,460
Um...

413
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:12,920
He's back, guys.

414
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:14,560
Hahaha!

415
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:16,820
Hahaha!

416
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:20,300
We got Dad...

417
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:23,120
We also stuffed Dad into his skin suit as well.

418
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,920
So, he's back as well, guys.

419
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:28,280
Now he can also be on stream with me!

420
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:30,300
Yeah!

421
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:31,360
Look at him!

422
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:32,860
He's so bouncy!

423
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,540
Dad is back!

424
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:36,400
Dad is back!

425
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:38,760
He's a super long boy too.

426
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:39,940
Um...

427
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:41,260
But yes.

428
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:41,960
Uh...

429
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:45,580
We stuffed Dad into his very own skin suit as well.

430
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:49,640
Um... And he really prefers being in the skin suit now.

431
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:51,900
Because, like, he has bigger claws.

432
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,960
And he can... He can dig.

433
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:54,820
Hahaha!

434
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:57,360
He's a... He's a tracker.

435
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:59,980
So, um... If you don't know, like...

436
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:05,460
Like, I mean... It's pretty ironic because, like, Dad was originally a wiener dog.

437
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:08,160
And, uh... Now he's like...

438
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,340
You know... And they're really good at tracking people.

439
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:13,840
And... You know, in Bounty Hunter lore, uh...

440
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:17,100
We need someone to be able to track the people for money.

441
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:19,260
So I can, like, kill them and get money.

442
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:23,300
I mean, since it's dead or alive, obviously I'm gonna choose the dead part because it's just easier.

443
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:26,660
It means I get to carry less weight to the police.

444
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:27,560
So...

445
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:31,020
I feel like if it's dead or alive, it's 100% dead.

446
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:34,100
Because then I don't have to worry about, like, carrying cargo.

447
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:35,500
And, uh...

448
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:36,020
Hahaha!

449
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:45,400
And... It makes it easier because Dad can, uh... Doki Amber Doge can... Sorry.

450
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:46,020
Not a dog.

451
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:46,520
Not a doge anymore.

452
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:48,340
Doki Amber...

453
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:50,180
What are you?

454
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:51,160
Hahaha!

455
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:53,520
Hahaha!

456
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:56,340
Yes!

457
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:58,080
Hahaha!

458
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:01,720
What are you?

459
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:02,520
Hahaha!

460
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:06,820
Um... He is some form of dog.

461
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:10,260
We've discovered a new breed of dog.

462
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:12,160
Um...

463
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,560
And...

464
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:14,560
Alright, alright, Dad.

465
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:15,280
You...

466
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,060
You dropped down right now, Dad.

467
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:18,160
Wooo!

468
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:19,260
Alright.

469
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:24,700
Also, let me show you guys some of the, uh... expressions that I can do now.

470
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:26,740
Yeah?

471
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:31,720
Was it worth the... Are you guys okay?

472
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:35,860
That we waited a day for this debut?

473
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:37,440
Hahaha!

474
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:39,440
Hahaha!

475
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:43,900
Are you guys okay with the weight?

476
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:45,920
Was the weight worth it?

477
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:46,560
Guys!

478
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:48,940
Was the weight worth it?

479
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:49,860
Hahaha!

480
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:53,360
Alright, so... Alright.

481
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:54,120
So...

482
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:57,820
You might have seen in my trailer video...

483
00:36:57,820 --> 00:36:59,220
My, uh...

484
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:01,440
Gameplay trailer video...

485
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:05,240
That, uh... I can have aimbot eyes now.

486
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:07,480
So... So...

487
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:11,780
This time, I have legal wall hacks in aimbot.

488
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:15,820
So, surely my gameplay is gonna improve now, right?

489
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:17,600
And I can, like...

490
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:18,340
Zoom in.

491
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:19,360
I can ADS.

492
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:23,660
Uh... My eye has a special feature where...

493
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:26,000
I can ADS with my eye.

494
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:26,820
Hahaha!

495
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:27,980
Hahaha!

496
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:31,700
So I'll be like, ADS time!

497
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:33,320
Hahaha!

498
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:37,000
Um... But yes.

499
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:40,060
Uh... So, anytime I'm...

500
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:44,140
Anytime I'm losing, I'll just turn aimbot on.

501
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,020
But it's legal!

502
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:45,600
It's...

503
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:48,700
It's legal aimbot because it's part of my body.

504
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:54,480
Like, you can't report me if it's, like, part of my... If it's a biological aimbot.

505
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:59,100
Like, it's like how Bloodhound has legal wall hacks when he scans the walls.

506
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:00,120
So...

507
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:02,380
Since this is in my eye...

508
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:03,260
It's...

509
00:38:03,710 --> 00:38:06,940
Legal aimbot, I say as I start downloading... Hahaha!

510
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:08,080
Hahaha!

511
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:15,940
Downloads aimbot but puts red eye on so people will be like, oh, she's just... She's just roleplaying, guys.

512
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:17,460
Like, it's part of her...

513
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:19,560
It's part of her lore and she's just...

514
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:21,920
She's just trying to make it immersive, guys.

515
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:22,580
Hahaha!

516
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:24,120
Alright.

517
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:25,840
Okay.

518
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:27,280
Another thing I have.

519
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:28,120
It's...

520
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:31,460
Oh...

521
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:34,540
What's... What's 2 plus 2?

522
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:35,580
Hahaha!

523
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:39,260
Dragoons, where am I?

524
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:40,860
Where do I go?

525
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:41,320
Hahaha!

526
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:43,020
I'm so lost!

527
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:45,300
Dragoons!

528
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:46,820
Okay.

529
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:47,140
Okay.

530
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:47,520
Okay.

531
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:50,020
This is another expression that...

532
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:51,960
I really like to make.

533
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:53,120
And it's this.

534
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:55,780
Hahaha!

535
00:38:58,370 --> 00:38:59,470
Oh my god!

536
00:38:59,510 --> 00:38:59,990
I love it!

537
00:39:00,070 --> 00:39:01,030
The little...

538
00:39:01,810 --> 00:39:04,630
That... It's like... It's like actual Doki bird.

539
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:05,330
The bird part.

540
00:39:06,830 --> 00:39:07,430
Hahaha!

541
00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:08,710
Hahaha!

542
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:11,190
I'm so not used to it!

543
00:39:12,570 --> 00:39:16,390
I can make faces I've never been able to make before.

544
00:39:16,670 --> 00:39:18,310
So it's so weird being like...

545
00:39:18,310 --> 00:39:19,450
I can... Okay.

546
00:39:19,510 --> 00:39:20,570
So this is frowning.

547
00:39:21,430 --> 00:39:22,710
But then I can do this.

548
00:39:24,670 --> 00:39:25,150
Hahaha!

549
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:27,070
You know like the little...

550
00:39:27,070 --> 00:39:30,430
The little teeth... Like mouth in front.

551
00:39:30,570 --> 00:39:30,950
Like...

552
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:32,650
Hahaha!

553
00:39:33,610 --> 00:39:34,090
Hahaha!

554
00:39:34,670 --> 00:39:35,150
Hahaha!

555
00:39:37,730 --> 00:39:38,210
Alright.

556
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:38,690
Okay.

557
00:39:38,830 --> 00:39:39,290
Here we go.

558
00:39:39,330 --> 00:39:40,670
And then... We have so many.

559
00:39:40,790 --> 00:39:41,550
I have like 3...

560
00:39:42,230 --> 00:39:43,010
Columns of this.

561
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:43,690
By the way.

562
00:39:43,770 --> 00:39:44,910
I'll have announcements soon.

563
00:39:45,030 --> 00:39:45,650
Announcements soon.

564
00:39:45,690 --> 00:39:46,710
But I need to show you guys this.

565
00:39:46,950 --> 00:39:47,310
Alright.

566
00:39:47,370 --> 00:39:47,710
Anyway.

567
00:39:47,770 --> 00:39:48,570
And then we have credits.

568
00:39:48,650 --> 00:39:49,410

614
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:18,960

00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:21,040

620
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:30,860

00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:35,640
Like... I didn't ask for... I didn't... I didn't say anything.

623
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:36,760
My mama was like...

00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:39,860
If you want me to make the neck longer, I will for you.

625
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:40,600
Hahaha!

00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:42,040

00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:52,160
Celia... Uh... She actually...

631
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:54,220
Like I didn't... I didn't ask her to.

632
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:56,080
I didn't ask my mama to do it.

633
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:57,080
But I thought it was just really funny.

634
00:41:57,260 --> 00:42:01,440
And then... I swear... My mama and papa were on like the same...

635
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:02,940

She just put it in.

639
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:11,140
She just put it in herself.

640
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:13,580
Because I was like... Oh, that's so funny mama!

641
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:14,340

00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:24,020
The extra sparkles.

647
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:25,100
So if I just...

648
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:28,140
You know... I'm not as excited as the other one.

649
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:30,020
You know... This would be like super excited.

650
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:31,140
And then...

651
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:32,260
The other one would be like... Oh!

652
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:32,780

653
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:33,560

654
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:34,880
I'm amused guys.

655
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:36,060
Anyway...

656
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:40,840
Also... Okay... Some guys were wondering... Can I take the jacket off?

657
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:42,580
Yes, I can.

658
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:45,260
Look... Okay... Before you're like...

659
00:42:45,260 --> 00:42:45,880
Oh my god!

660
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:46,420
She's flat.

661
00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:48,740
Wait until I... You see the reference sheet.

662
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:49,040
Okay?

663
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:49,980

00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:51,680
Hahaha!

665
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:54,280
Look...

666
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:57,060
I have to run a lot as a bounty hunter.

667
00:42:57,340 --> 00:42:57,980
Okay guys?

668
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:00,520
I have to run a lot as a bounty hunter.

669
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:03,480
And because of that, I have to put on a sports bra.

670
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:04,200
Okay?

671
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:07,980
People with sports bra... People... People with boobs would understand!

672
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:11,160
Hahaha!

673
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:12,860
People...

674
00:43:12,860 --> 00:43:14,820
People with boobs would understand!

675
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:16,780
The... The parallels!

676
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:19,040
You do not want to... You do not...

677
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:22,000
You want a good sports bra when you're riding a horse!

678
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:23,660
You would understand!

679
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:24,820
Hahaha!

680
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:26,200
So true!

681
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:27,560
Hahaha!

682
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:32,940
All I'm saying is that you can't have...

683
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:35,900
You have to have a sports bra on when you're riding a horse.

684
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:37,260
That's all I'll say.

685
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:38,440
That's all.

686
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:40,680
That's all I'll say!

687
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:43,040
Anyway... Jacket back on.

688
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:46,860
Uh... But yes, I can... I can take my jacket off.

689
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:48,700
And this is what... This is what it looks like.

690
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:50,160
Whoa...

691
00:43:51,940 --> 00:43:52,820
Yes... And...

692
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:55,160
Uh... Another thing...

693
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:55,600
Oh yes!

694
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:00,800
I can wear my avi... I mean, of course I should be able to wear my aviators.

695
00:44:00,860 --> 00:44:03,640
It's literally like... It's not like fucking sewn into my jacket.

696
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:05,180
Um...

697
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:09,020
This... I don't know if you guys would notice this, but...

698
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:11,040
Uh... The aviators...

699
00:44:11,780 --> 00:44:12,940
Like this look...

700
00:44:12,940 --> 00:44:14,280
The aviators part...

701
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:15,620
Because I really wanted aviators.

702
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:20,880
It was very inspired by... Uh...

703
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:23,080
Sniper from Team Fortress 2.

704
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:25,320
But like... The aviators part...

705
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:25,880
Hahaha!

706
00:44:27,140 --> 00:44:27,920
Hahaha!

707
00:44:28,670 --> 00:44:31,240
I really... I really wanted aviators.

708
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:32,940
Because you know... You know like gamer...

709
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:34,360
Gamer... Gamer glasses?

710
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:36,660
That was a thing back then.

711
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:38,000
You know like those gamer glasses?

712
00:44:38,260 --> 00:44:40,800
That was a thing like... Like 8 years ago.

713
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:45,600
Where they're like... You have to wear those like gamer glasses because it's gonna improve your performance.

714
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:51,160
And then it was also inspired by Sniper from Team Fortress 2.

715
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:53,940
Whatever happened to those gamer... The gunners!

716
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:54,320
Yes!

717
00:44:54,700 --> 00:44:56,300
Whatever happened to the gunners?

718
00:44:56,460 --> 00:44:57,460
Do they still exist?

719
00:44:57,940 --> 00:44:58,540
Are they...

720
00:44:58,540 --> 00:44:59,380
Are they still relevant?

721
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:00,160
I don't know.

722
00:45:00,260 --> 00:45:01,900
I don't know if they're still relevant at all.

723
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:02,880
Um...

724
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:06,340
And... Um...

725
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:08,560
I don't know if...

726
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:10,380
Uh... If they're still...

727
00:45:10,380 --> 00:45:10,980
They're still around.

728
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:12,000
But anyway...

729
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,880
Other than that... Uh...

730
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:15,360
Let me put my glasses away.

731
00:45:15,540 --> 00:45:16,660
I can also...

732
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:19,120
Hmm...

733
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:20,560
Hahaha!

734
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:21,360
Hahaha!

735
00:45:22,540 --> 00:45:23,520
Oh... Fuck.

736
00:45:23,620 --> 00:45:24,160
But yes.

737
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:26,780
If I'm like... I'm laughing too much.

738
00:45:26,820 --> 00:45:27,540
I need to be relatable.

739
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:28,520
And like...

740
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:30,260
Show other emotions or they'll think I'm AI.

741
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:33,920
I can force my skin suit to frown for me.

742
00:45:34,820 --> 00:45:36,520
So like... You know...

743
00:45:36,660 --> 00:45:37,460
I'm like... Oh no!

744
00:45:37,620 --> 00:45:38,240
They're gonna think...

745
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:39,780
They're gonna realize I'm actually...

746
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:40,700
Not real.

747
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:42,180
Because all I do...

748
00:45:42,180 --> 00:45:43,620
All I do is just laugh.

749
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:44,260
And they're like...

750
00:45:44,260 --> 00:45:46,480
No real person only laughs.

751
00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:48,400
And only shows laughter as an emotion.

752
00:45:49,220 --> 00:45:50,480
She might not be real.

753
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:52,140
And then I would just be like...

754
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:52,640
Don't worry.

755
00:45:52,740 --> 00:45:53,700
I can also frown.

756
00:45:53,980 --> 00:45:57,320
But like... I'll be forcing my skin suit to frown.

757
00:45:57,500 --> 00:45:58,820
So they'll never expect it.

758
00:45:59,080 --> 00:45:59,420
Hahaha!

759
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:01,240
Hahaha!

760
00:46:04,590 --> 00:46:05,430
Oh god!

761
00:46:05,490 --> 00:46:06,210
It's so unnatural!

762
00:46:06,210 --> 00:46:09,410
I just need to make sure I don't laugh when I say that.

763
00:46:09,930 --> 00:46:10,290
Anyway...

764
00:46:11,650 --> 00:46:12,010
Finally...

765
00:46:12,010 --> 00:46:13,710
I have this.

766
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:22,600
I have the...

767
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:23,300
Oh my god!

768
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:23,820
Can I say... No!

769
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:24,200
I'm Indie.

770
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:24,600
I can say it.

771
00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:25,600
I have mind break eyes.

772
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:32,780
I was like... Wait... Am I allowed to say...

773
00:46:32,780 --> 00:46:32,960
Yeah.

774
00:46:33,140 --> 00:46:33,700
I can.

775
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:34,740
Um...

776
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:36,080
I have... Yeah.

777
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:36,680
Soul-less eyes.

778
00:46:36,740 --> 00:46:36,980
Sorry!

779
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:38,420
I meant soul... That's what I meant!

780
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:38,920
Sorry!

781
00:46:39,260 --> 00:46:39,580
PG.

782
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:40,400
Soul-less eyes.

783
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:41,400
Soul-less...

784
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:41,900
Hahaha!

785
00:46:42,780 --> 00:46:43,340
Hahaha!

786
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:48,340
I have... I have...

787
00:46:48,340 --> 00:46:49,760
I didn't request for these eyes.

788
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:50,940
It was given to me.

789
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:52,080
Um...

790
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:54,020
It was... It's... The soul-less eyes.

791
00:46:54,180 --> 00:46:54,600
Yes!

792
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:54,840
Yes!

793
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:55,980
That's what I mean!

794
00:46:56,140 --> 00:46:57,400
The soul-less eyes.

795
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:01,340
That's exactly what I intentionally meant, guys.

796
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:04,180
I did not mean anything else.

797
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:06,280
That's what I meant, chat.

798
00:47:07,180 --> 00:47:08,000
So yes!

799
00:47:08,820 --> 00:47:09,260
Um...

800
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:11,220
That... Oh!

801
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:12,600
I can also take my clip off.

802
00:47:12,660 --> 00:47:14,780
But I don't remember what number that was.

803
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:16,140
What was that number?

804
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:17,380
Is it... Okay.

805
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:19,220
We're gonna play around with the numbers now.

806
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:20,500
What could it be?

807
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:22,700
There's like so many numbers.

808
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:23,340
Whoa!

809
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:24,280
What did I put on?

810
00:47:24,860 --> 00:47:25,300
Oh!

811
00:47:25,340 --> 00:47:26,200
That's the soul-less eyes.

812
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:26,480
Oh!

813
00:47:26,580 --> 00:47:26,880
Yes!

814
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:27,500
There we go!

815
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:28,080
Yes!

816
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:28,740
I can...

817
00:47:28,740 --> 00:47:29,520
Okay.

818
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:30,640
Also like...

819
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:32,120
I...

820
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:34,520
I know some of you guys might have been like...

821
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:34,840
Wait!

822
00:47:35,100 --> 00:47:36,340
That hair clip!

823
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:42,300
That hair clip!

824
00:47:42,540 --> 00:47:42,680
That hair clip!

825
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:46,360
That's... Someone else has a similar hair clip as well.

826
00:47:46,660 --> 00:47:50,740
I just want you guys to know that it was a huge coincidence.

827
00:47:51,220 --> 00:48:06,140
It was a big coincidence because my mama actually put the hair clip... Like designed the... Designed the skin suit with that hair clip before... Um...

828
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:12,060
Before I talked to that one person that shared the similar hair clip.

829
00:48:16,140 --> 00:48:21,980
And I remember I told... I told that VTuber I was like... Oh my god!

830
00:48:23,180 --> 00:48:25,040
This was not intentional.

831
00:48:25,100 --> 00:48:28,240
When I do this debut, it is not intentional.

832
00:48:28,300 --> 00:48:35,180
My mama actually put that hair clip on by herself.

833
00:48:35,180 --> 00:48:35,880
So...

834
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:39,640
Yes, I can take off the hair clip.

835
00:48:39,780 --> 00:48:44,440
Anyway, those were all my... Um... The things I can do.

836
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:46,000
Anyway, uh...

837
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,720
Before I do announcement, let's go to the saloon.

838
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:50,920
Yes, the saloon.

839
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:58,260
Oh my god.

840
00:48:58,500 --> 00:49:01,740
Alright, this is gonna be where we're gonna hang out now.

841
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:06,280
Guys, I love the saloon.

842
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:08,720
It's one of my favorite places to go to now.

843
00:49:09,220 --> 00:49:11,420
Because... Okay, look in the back though.

844
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:12,400
Like...

845
00:49:16,260 --> 00:49:18,820
Okay, but... Look at...

846
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:21,520
Look at the back over there.

847
00:49:21,780 --> 00:49:23,260
Uh... There's two tomatoes?

848
00:49:23,740 --> 00:49:25,240
You mean there's more than one?

849
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:29,300
Oh my god!

850
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:30,540
They're multiplying!

851
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:34,920
I think my favorite is that... Uh...

852
00:49:35,020 --> 00:49:37,080
That chonky goon over there.

853
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:42,000
Make... Making those burlesque egg goons dance for him.

854
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:42,840
Like...

855
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:49,440
Okay, now that I said that out loud, it is absolutely more creepy than I realized when I said that out loud.

856
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:56,080
Um... But you know how like every saloon, there's like... There's like women there that would be like, hey there cowboy.

857
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:57,560
You want...

858
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:05,820
Look, they need to make money!

859
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:07,580
They need to...

860
00:50:07,580 --> 00:50:09,880
They need to make money!

861
00:50:10,700 --> 00:50:12,800
It's hard times out there.

862
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,440
Um... In the wild west chat.

863
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:16,920
It's hard times.

864
00:50:17,340 --> 00:50:18,020
Um...

865
00:50:18,740 --> 00:50:20,620
And I'm drinking my favorite drink.

866
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:22,640
Uh... Uh... Doking...

867
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:24,200
Uh... Fuck.

868
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:24,520
Okay.

869
00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:25,760
Doking rum.

870
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:26,560
Yes.

871
00:50:26,780 --> 00:50:29,820
From... From... Which I've made, obviously.

872
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:31,280
I own doking rum.

873
00:50:31,540 --> 00:50:34,700
And so you guys should also buy doking rum.

874
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:37,620
And it invest in my... Invest in my product.

875
00:50:37,900 --> 00:50:39,280
To the moon it goes.

876
00:50:39,780 --> 00:50:40,540
Uh... Anyway!

877
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:43,460
Let's welcome my new chatting...

878
00:50:43,460 --> 00:50:44,760
My new chatting area.

00:50:44,900 --> 00:50:47,020
That I didn't break into this time.

880
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:48,200
I didn't break into.

881
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:53,040
Uh... I actually... You know, this is one of my favorite establishments to go to.

882
00:50:53,180 --> 00:50:54,700
The little... The local saloon.

883
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:55,240
You know?

884
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:01,940
It's just my... My local saloon, guys.

885
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:03,860
Uh...

886
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:04,680
Oh, gosh.

887
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:05,000
I'm so...

888
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:05,380
I'm so nervous.

889
00:51:05,580 --> 00:51:05,860
Alright!

890
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:06,740
Finally!

891
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:09,360
Before I talk about credits...

892
00:51:10,830 --> 00:51:12,200
It's announcements time.

893
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:14,880
Before I give into details about...

894
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:16,580
You know, production credits.

895
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:19,360
And, um... All the concept arts.

896
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:20,740
And...

897
00:51:20,740 --> 00:51:22,860
Um... Everything that went into it.

898
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,160
I have...

899
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:25,920
How many announcements do I have?

900
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:27,200
I have...

901
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:29,100
Two really...

902
00:51:29,100 --> 00:51:31,300
Really big announcements.

903
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:33,940
And I...

904
00:51:35,020 --> 00:51:37,780
I am gonna go with the smaller one first.

905
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:41,700
So, I asked if I could announce this one.

906
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:42,560
Oh, yeah.

907
00:51:42,580 --> 00:51:44,700
By the way, I have a... Oh, by the way.

908
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:44,980
Sorry.

909
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:45,320
Nevermind.

00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:46,060
Merch.

911
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:50,280
First off...

912
00:51:51,060 --> 00:51:51,620
Merch!

913
00:51:53,300 --> 00:51:58,560
Before I talk about the announcements, I have a new logo now!

914
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:02,220
And also, merch is up!

915
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:03,120
Yes!

916
00:52:03,540 --> 00:52:04,560
Debut merch!

917
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:13,060
Uh, if you go to Doki Merch right now, you can pre-order uh, the new acrylic stand!

918
00:52:14,060 --> 00:52:15,820
Drawn by my mama!

919
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:18,880
Who I will... Obviously, I feel like you guys already know who my mama is.

920
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,600
But I will reveal my mama!

921
00:52:21,060 --> 00:52:22,120
In like, woah!

922
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:23,620
Like, who's your mama?

923
00:52:23,860 --> 00:52:25,160
Don't play fucking dumb with me.

924
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:25,800
I know you all know.

925
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:31,920
Anyway...

926
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:32,940
Yes!

927
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:34,540
Drawn by my mama!

928
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:39,140
And my mama will also be drawing a huge illustration later.

929
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:40,740
But like, we couldn't get it done in time.

930
00:52:40,860 --> 00:52:41,140
But!

931
00:52:41,220 --> 00:52:43,320
They finished the acrylic stand!

932
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:44,540
The key visual!

933
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:46,000
Um...

934
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,380
Alright, I'm gonna pin my mod.

935
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:48,580
My mod, can you...

936
00:52:48,580 --> 00:52:50,180
Can you write that message again?

937
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:51,800
Chat's going so fast, they didn't...

938
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:54,220
Chat's going so fast, they don't realize I'm a cowboy.

939
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:55,080
Uh...

940
00:52:59,940 --> 00:53:00,900
But yes!

941
00:53:01,620 --> 00:53:03,460
New merch is out!

942
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:07,540
There's gonna be even more merch that's coming out on my birthday!

943
00:53:07,900 --> 00:53:11,880
Because we weren't able to set all of it up in time.

944
00:53:12,140 --> 00:53:12,620
So...

945
00:53:12,620 --> 00:53:13,340
Um...

946
00:53:13,340 --> 00:53:17,080
For now, we only have debut merch right now!

947
00:53:17,340 --> 00:53:19,900
Uh... But yes!

948
00:53:20,140 --> 00:53:22,180
I'll put this away for now.

949
00:53:22,460 --> 00:53:23,680
Anyway, new merch!

950
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:24,140
Anyway!

951
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:26,220
First announcement!

952
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:27,500
Oh, which one?

953
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:31,880
Alright, let me pin... I'm gonna pin SilentSweeper because the link is first.

954
00:53:32,100 --> 00:53:33,600
Okay, first announcement.

955
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:35,080
Um...

956
00:53:36,220 --> 00:53:43,180
I will be on the Gamersupps V-Card Trading Cards.

957
00:53:43,460 --> 00:53:44,340
Um...

958
00:53:44,340 --> 00:53:49,280
So, if you guys do not know, Gamersupps is...

959
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:55,120
Gamersupps is releasing VTuber cards.

960
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:57,280
VTuber trading cards.

961
00:53:57,400 --> 00:54:01,740
And I will be part of the V-Card collection.

962
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:14,000
This is also why I chose this week to reveal my skin suit because people were gonna be sent my cards like next week.

963
00:54:19,340 --> 00:54:22,080
So I was like, oh fuck, okay.

964
00:54:27,820 --> 00:54:35,880
Because I had a decision on whether or not, like, people were gonna be given like early access.

965
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:45,340
So I had a decision on whether or not if I should wanted to use my old skin suit or my new skin suit.

966
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:52,300
And I chose, I decided to choose the new skin suit because I was like, yeah, fuck it.

967
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:53,720
That should... I... fuck it.

968
00:54:53,780 --> 00:54:54,040
Let's go.

969
00:54:56,140 --> 00:54:56,800
Let's go.

970
00:54:57,040 --> 00:55:01,160
Anyway, I am also allowed to show you guys the sketches.

971
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:03,700
The illustrations are finished.

972
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:04,540
But...

973
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:08,360
I do have the sketches here.

974
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:13,360
So we have the main art illustration.

975
00:55:14,420 --> 00:55:15,920
This is the sketch by the way.

976
00:55:15,980 --> 00:55:20,820
It's not the finished because I'm keeping the finished versions like...

977
00:55:21,820 --> 00:55:26,760
Not secret but like when it's released you guys would be able to see the finish but it's just more or less a teaser.

978
00:55:27,100 --> 00:55:29,600
So this is the sketch for the full art.

979
00:55:29,940 --> 00:55:32,160
And then this is...

980
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:33,100
Sorry.

981
00:55:33,260 --> 00:55:34,440
This is the sketch.

982
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:35,340
For...

983
00:55:36,460 --> 00:55:38,660
For the other one.

984
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:40,680
And...

985
00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:46,060
And then finally we have one for...

986
00:55:46,060 --> 00:55:48,140
One for the dragoons too.

987
00:55:48,340 --> 00:55:52,560
So here are... Here's the dragoons version as well.

988
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:57,960
So I've seen the finished copies of all of them.

989
00:55:58,040 --> 00:55:59,800
And it's sick as fuck.

990
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:07,200
The reason why I'm green is that I am a grass type because I'm a bird.

991
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:08,660
So it made sense.

992
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:11,520
I mean they don't have the fucking wild west type, you know?

993
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:12,160
So...

994
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:12,740
I don't know.

995
00:56:12,820 --> 00:56:14,780
It was like water, fire, grass, electric.

996
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:18,180
And then we were like well dragoons...

997
00:56:18,180 --> 00:56:22,440
Because we had to make it based off of like where you're...

998
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:23,500
There's no flying type.

999
00:56:24,060 --> 00:56:26,020
I would have chosen flying type if there was.

1000
00:56:26,580 --> 00:56:29,980
So... And like you know my true form is a tomato in the end.

1001
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:32,400
So like obviously um...

1002
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:38,460
Obviously, you know, since my true form is a tomato, it would make sense for me to be a grass type.

1003
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:39,720
Because that's my true form.

1004
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:40,480
Alright!

1005
00:56:41,460 --> 00:56:43,280
The biggest announcement!

1006
00:56:44,140 --> 00:56:44,700
Um...

1007
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:48,840
Which I feel like some of you guys have predicted already.

1008
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:52,720
Um... I might as well just show you guys the video.

1009
00:56:55,380 --> 00:56:55,940
Alright.

1010
00:56:57,880 --> 00:57:00,700
So my biggest announcement...

1011
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:02,200
is...

1012
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:02,960
Oh!

1013
00:57:04,100 --> 00:57:05,240
What's it gonna be?

1014
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:07,380
What's it gonna be?

1015
00:57:07,740 --> 00:57:09,280
It is...

1016
00:57:11,780 --> 00:57:12,480
Yeah!

1017
00:57:14,900 --> 00:57:15,960
That's right!

1018
00:57:20,060 --> 00:57:22,980
We're gonna have a PC case!

1019
00:57:23,860 --> 00:57:24,560
Yes!

1020
00:57:24,660 --> 00:57:27,140
That's based off of my new skin suit!

1021
00:57:27,460 --> 00:57:33,140
I think the black and gold looks fucking amazing in the back.

1022
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:33,780
Not gonna lie.

1023
00:57:33,900 --> 00:57:36,620
The black and gold really works um...

1024
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:38,180
super well.

1025
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:39,200
Um...

1026
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:39,940
But yes!

1027
00:57:40,420 --> 00:57:41,140
Um...

1028
00:57:41,140 --> 00:57:45,140
You will be able to see this at Anime Expo!

1029
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:46,280
Um...

1030
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:50,340
On July 4th to whenever Anime Expo ends.

1031
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:52,900
And there's not just a PC case.

1032
00:57:53,020 --> 00:57:57,460
This is basically a teaser for the other products.

1033
00:57:57,720 --> 00:58:02,580
We worked with Hyatt and iBUYPOWER to design...

1034
00:58:02,580 --> 00:58:03,820
I put a lot of...

1035
00:58:03,820 --> 00:58:05,560
I put a lot of like...

1036
00:58:06,220 --> 00:58:07,720
I guess... What's the word?

1037
00:58:07,900 --> 00:58:10,020
A lot of my input on it.

1038
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:11,800
On various things.

1039
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:12,640
Various products.

1040
00:58:13,140 --> 00:58:16,420
With Hyatt and um... iBUYPOWER.

1041
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:18,280
And um...

1042
00:58:18,280 --> 00:58:18,880
Oh my gosh!

1043
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:20,520
I cannot wait for you guys to see it.

1044
00:58:20,620 --> 00:58:24,860
I cannot wait for you guys to see the other merch line with them.

1045
00:58:24,980 --> 00:58:25,240
But!

1046
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:26,120
Yes!

1047
00:58:26,120 --> 00:58:31,800
At Anime Expo, you guys will be able to see the products there.

1048
00:58:32,140 --> 00:58:33,900
And I think... I don't know if you're allowed to touch it.

1049
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:34,260
But...

1050
00:58:37,620 --> 00:58:38,060
Um...

1051
00:58:38,060 --> 00:58:38,840
But...

1052
00:58:39,460 --> 00:58:41,360
That is why... That is like...

1053
00:58:41,360 --> 00:58:44,000
One of the hype things in July.

1054
00:58:44,100 --> 00:58:45,780
I don't know if you guys know this.

1055
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:47,900
But... If you guys don't follow me on Twitter.

1056
00:58:48,180 --> 00:58:50,080
But I talked about how...

1057
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:51,760
Um... How...

1058
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:53,920
The beginning of... Not just the beginning.

1059
00:58:54,060 --> 00:58:54,860
The month of July.

1060
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:56,100
There's gonna be...

1061
00:58:56,120 --> 00:58:58,240
A lot of announcements.

1062
00:58:58,780 --> 00:59:01,460
And a lot of things that's gonna be happening.

1063
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:02,640
In July.

1064
00:59:03,020 --> 00:59:03,900
And like...

1065
00:59:03,900 --> 00:59:06,620
The Hyatt thing is only one of them.

1066
00:59:07,060 --> 00:59:08,480
And... Because I was like...

1067
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:08,880
Oh my gosh!

1068
00:59:08,900 --> 00:59:09,920
A lot of my dreams are coming true.

1069
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:11,840
It's not just a PC case.

1070
00:59:12,100 --> 00:59:13,220
There's so much more.

1071
00:59:13,420 --> 00:59:17,840
And that's why I also have not done a goals list.

1072
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:18,940
At all.

1073
00:59:19,820 --> 00:59:20,380
Because...

1074
00:59:20,380 --> 00:59:22,520
Um... If I do the goals list.

1075
00:59:22,660 --> 00:59:25,380
I'm gonna spoil some of the future announcements.

1076
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:26,060
So...

1077
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,340
I've been keeping it in.

1078
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:32,280
And being like... Oh I can't talk about...

1079
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:34,180
I can't talk about...

1080
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:36,480
Like...

1081
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:37,360
I can't put it as a goal!

1082
00:59:37,580 --> 00:59:39,000
Because I'm gonna get it!

1083
00:59:41,620 --> 00:59:42,220
And...

1084
00:59:42,220 --> 00:59:43,680
And that includes...

1085
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:44,980
A PC case.

1086
00:59:45,120 --> 00:59:48,420
And I'm so happy because...

1087
00:59:48,420 --> 00:59:49,400
Um...

1088
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:52,900
A PC case has been a dream of mine.

1089
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:55,560
For like... Not just like a PC case.

1090
00:59:59,500 --> 01:00:08,520
I'm so happy that it is finally becoming a reality!

1091
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:11,580
I'm really happy.

1092
01:00:12,020 --> 01:00:21,660
And I know so many Dragoons have been waiting for a really long time for this.

1093
01:00:21,660 --> 01:00:31,580
And I know that despite you guys have evolved into birds now, I hope you're still excited for this PC case.

1094
01:00:31,900 --> 01:00:38,680
And I specifically requested that I wanted Dragoons to be a part of my merch line.

1095
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:44,620
So all the merch stuff that they're releasing includes the Dragoons.

1096
01:00:44,780 --> 01:00:48,080
Because they're like, do you just want you or do you want to have other stuff?

1097
01:00:48,180 --> 01:00:51,380
I was like, I want that in there and the Dragoons.

1098
01:00:51,380 --> 01:00:52,380
And they're like, okay, which form?

1099
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:54,840
I was like, I want all the Dragoons!

1100
01:00:54,840 --> 01:00:58,280
All types of Dragoons have to be in there!

1101
01:00:58,640 --> 01:01:01,340
So I specifically...

1102
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:10,380
Because I couldn't have made it this far or got here without you guys.

1103
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:16,180
And without your support and everything.

1104
01:01:17,320 --> 01:01:21,360
So that's why I've always wanted to include you guys into my...

1105
01:01:21,380 --> 01:01:24,580
As many merch line or sponsors and stuff.

1106
01:01:24,780 --> 01:01:26,320
Because I want you guys with me!

1107
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:28,720
I want you guys with me on these things.

1108
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:31,980
And I also designed some of the...

1109
01:01:31,980 --> 01:01:38,220
I guess I gave a lot of input and design for the merch line as well.

1110
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:40,780
So you're going to see some products and I can talk...

1111
01:01:40,780 --> 01:01:46,460
When the products are finally out, I can finally talk more about what I added.

1112
01:01:46,620 --> 01:01:48,600
And what I gave my input on.

1113
01:01:49,860 --> 01:01:51,180
Because we worked really hard.

1114
01:01:51,180 --> 01:01:55,080
It was like a lot of back and forth for it.

1115
01:01:55,320 --> 01:01:55,720
So...

1116
01:01:56,860 --> 01:01:58,720
What else did I want to say?

1117
01:01:59,580 --> 01:02:01,520
About the PC case.

1118
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:06,860
Yes, you guys can finally own a triangular PC case.

1119
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:12,040
Oh my god!

1120
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:14,200
Finally, you can match with me!

1121
01:02:15,140 --> 01:02:18,320
I have a triangular PC case too!

1122
01:02:19,060 --> 01:02:20,380
Oh yes, by the way.

1123
01:02:20,380 --> 01:02:22,320
Doki Merch now ships to Indonesia.

1124
01:02:22,560 --> 01:02:23,420
We did it guys.

1125
01:02:23,660 --> 01:02:25,060
We fucking did it.

1126
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:27,600
Because I know...

1127
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:32,620
Like before we didn't have Indonesia as one of the shipping profiles.

1128
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:37,500
But by the way, we've added Indonesia into Doki Merch.

1129
01:02:37,560 --> 01:02:38,620
So now you can...

1130
01:02:38,620 --> 01:02:42,520
Now you can buy Doki Merch products.

1131
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,380
And have it shipped to Indonesia.

1132
01:02:46,040 --> 01:02:49,760
Yes, now you guys can own a triangular PC case.

1133
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:51,260
Yes, you can match with me!

1134
01:02:52,140 --> 01:02:54,200
You guys can finally match with me.

1135
01:02:54,460 --> 01:02:54,800
Chat.

1136
01:02:58,980 --> 01:02:59,460
Okay.

1137
01:02:59,780 --> 01:03:00,260
Anyway.

1138
01:03:00,680 --> 01:03:02,000
There's also...

1139
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:02,740
Is there another announcement?

1140
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:04,260
I have another announcement.

1141
01:03:04,660 --> 01:03:05,100
Alright.

1142
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:05,940
Oh yeah, like I said.

1143
01:03:06,620 --> 01:03:07,100
Um...

1144
01:03:07,700 --> 01:03:08,180
Um...

1145
01:03:08,180 --> 01:03:09,820
There is like...

1146
01:03:09,820 --> 01:03:10,300
Uh...

1147
01:03:10,300 --> 01:03:14,080
A lot of my future announcements coming in as well.

1148
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:15,120
So...

1149
01:03:15,680 --> 01:03:17,080
You guys might be like, oh is that it?

1150
01:03:17,180 --> 01:03:17,500
Is that...

1151
01:03:17,500 --> 01:03:19,140
I mean, that's a lot of stuff.

1152
01:03:19,260 --> 01:03:19,520
But...

1153
01:03:21,140 --> 01:03:24,040
I'm gonna fatten you up, dragoons!

1154
01:03:25,340 --> 01:03:27,140
Feeding you every month!

1155
01:03:31,220 --> 01:03:32,380
But yes.

1156
01:03:32,560 --> 01:03:34,920
There is more announcements.

1157
01:03:36,140 --> 01:03:38,140
More announcements coming in.

1158
01:03:38,300 --> 01:03:39,200
I think like...

1159
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:41,900
Either next week or...

1160
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:46,200
I think like either next week or July.

1161
01:03:46,360 --> 01:03:47,020
Beginning of July.

1162
01:03:47,500 --> 01:03:48,620
Or July 4th.

1163
01:03:48,620 --> 01:03:48,900
I think.

1164
01:03:48,920 --> 01:03:49,360
On my birthday.

1165
01:03:49,480 --> 01:03:50,360
I think it was on my birthday.

1166
01:03:50,460 --> 01:03:50,840
I don't remember.

1167
01:03:51,100 --> 01:03:51,480
Uh...

1168
01:03:51,480 --> 01:03:52,660
But you guys have to wait.

1169
01:03:52,780 --> 01:03:54,380
You guys have to wait two more weeks, guys.

1170
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:55,220
Two more weeks!

1171
01:03:55,400 --> 01:03:58,540
And then you can finally figure out what it is!

1172
01:03:58,740 --> 01:03:59,180
Alright.

1173
01:04:00,040 --> 01:04:04,840
I have a list of things I have to do regarding this showcase.

1174
01:04:05,240 --> 01:04:12,200
But first off, we gotta thank the project team for their incredible hard work on all of this.

1175
01:04:12,360 --> 01:04:12,820
Um...

1176
01:04:12,820 --> 01:04:16,460
I was looking at my chat while the entire thing was playing.

1177
01:04:16,460 --> 01:04:18,840
And you guys were like, Oh my god!

1178
01:04:19,500 --> 01:04:22,220
No wonder you had to delay it!

1179
01:04:22,380 --> 01:04:23,560
And I was like, Oh thank god.

1180
01:04:23,600 --> 01:04:24,460
Now they realize why.

1181
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:28,460
I was like, You guys have to see it to see why it was delayed!

1182
01:04:30,820 --> 01:04:33,800
When you see it, you will know!

1183
01:04:36,340 --> 01:04:36,860
Alright.

1184
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:38,320
To the credits we go!

1185
01:04:39,580 --> 01:04:40,100
Alright!

1186
01:04:41,180 --> 01:04:41,700
Yes.

1187
01:04:41,800 --> 01:04:42,640
First off.

1188
01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:44,220
We are gonna go...

1189
01:04:44,220 --> 01:04:44,660
Okay.

1190
01:04:44,660 --> 01:04:46,100
I can actually be able to move myself.

1191
01:04:46,280 --> 01:04:46,460
Okay.

1192
01:04:46,540 --> 01:04:48,280
We are gonna go with...

1193
01:04:49,040 --> 01:04:49,660
Obviously...

1194
01:04:49,660 --> 01:04:50,560
Uh...

1195
01:04:50,560 --> 01:04:52,200
My new mama.

1196
01:04:53,040 --> 01:04:53,660
And...

1197
01:04:53,660 --> 01:04:54,360
Um...

1198
01:04:54,360 --> 01:04:59,000
I feel like it was the worst kept secret.

1199
01:05:02,740 --> 01:05:05,440
The moment you're like, The hands!

1200
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:10,300
Um...

1201
01:05:10,300 --> 01:05:11,280
But...

1202
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:13,080
Oh my god.

1203
01:05:13,080 --> 01:05:24,360
I am very happy to have Kamame to be my new mama for my new skin suit.

1204
01:05:25,040 --> 01:05:25,580
Um...

1205
01:05:25,580 --> 01:05:27,560
I was really happy about it.

1206
01:05:27,700 --> 01:05:31,360
I remember talking to them and being like, Are you interested?

1207
01:05:31,860 --> 01:05:33,100
And they were like, Of course!

1208
01:05:33,240 --> 01:05:33,560
Yes!

1209
01:05:33,820 --> 01:05:34,060
Yes!

1210
01:05:34,100 --> 01:05:35,240
I really wanna do it!

1211
01:05:35,320 --> 01:05:35,860
And then...

1212
01:05:35,860 --> 01:05:36,760
You know...

1213
01:05:36,760 --> 01:05:37,880
It was like instant.

1214
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:38,920
And then so...

1215
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:40,780
Um...

1216
01:05:40,780 --> 01:05:46,120
I'm really happy to be able to work with Kamame, Tsugogo...

1217
01:05:46,570 --> 01:05:46,940
Um...

1218
01:05:46,940 --> 01:05:48,700
As my mama.

1219
01:05:49,450 --> 01:05:49,820
Um...

1220
01:05:49,820 --> 01:05:51,300
Because, you know...

1221
01:05:51,300 --> 01:05:51,800
They...

1222
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:52,540
Uh...

1223
01:05:52,540 --> 01:05:53,140
Alright.

1224
01:05:53,220 --> 01:05:54,300
This is gonna get emotional.

1225
01:05:54,840 --> 01:05:56,520
This is gonna get mushy.

1226
01:05:56,760 --> 01:06:00,560
I hope my mama isn't figuring out how to translate this.

1227
01:06:00,800 --> 01:06:01,200
Um...

1228
01:06:03,590 --> 01:06:03,960
On...

1229
01:06:04,490 --> 01:06:05,360
On this part.

1230
01:06:05,720 --> 01:06:06,460
Um...

1231
01:06:06,460 --> 01:06:07,160
But...

1232
01:06:07,160 --> 01:06:07,780
Uh...

1233
01:06:07,780 --> 01:06:08,600
Basically...

1234
01:06:08,600 --> 01:06:10,480
The reason why I...

1235
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:12,620
I wanted to go...

1236
01:06:12,620 --> 01:06:13,320
Uh...

1237
01:06:13,320 --> 01:06:13,660
With...

1238
01:06:14,120 --> 01:06:14,500
Uh...

1239
01:06:14,500 --> 01:06:15,440
This artist...

1240
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:16,320
As...

1241
01:06:16,320 --> 01:06:16,900
Uh...

1242
01:06:17,320 --> 01:06:17,660
My...

1243
01:06:17,660 --> 01:06:18,140
Uh...

1244
01:06:18,140 --> 01:06:19,340
New mama...

1245
01:06:19,340 --> 01:06:20,460
Is...

1246
01:06:20,460 --> 01:06:21,300
Because...

1247
01:06:21,300 --> 01:06:21,840
Uh...

1248
01:06:21,840 --> 01:06:24,540
I really wanted to make them proud...

1249
01:06:24,540 --> 01:06:25,440
Of me...

1250
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:28,880
As one of their newer Vtuber children.

1251
01:06:29,320 --> 01:06:33,440
Because I felt like I wasn't really able to in the past.

1252
01:06:33,600 --> 01:06:36,800
And I didn't really have a lot to give to them in the past.

1253
01:06:37,060 --> 01:06:38,400
To show my efforts.

1254
01:06:38,420 --> 01:06:38,580
And...

1255
01:06:38,580 --> 01:06:38,720
I didn't really want to show my efforts...

1256
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:39,960
Or accomplish much...

1257
01:06:39,960 --> 01:06:41,520
Or really be a good Vtuber child.

1258
01:06:41,840 --> 01:06:43,360
So this is sort of like...

1259
01:06:43,360 --> 01:06:44,080
Round two.

1260
01:06:48,900 --> 01:06:50,620
This is like...

1261
01:06:50,620 --> 01:06:51,540
Round 2.

1262
01:06:52,260 --> 01:06:52,720
For...

1263
01:06:53,620 --> 01:06:54,300
And...

1264
01:06:55,440 --> 01:06:56,120
Um...

1265
01:06:56,120 --> 01:06:57,920
I really wanted to accomplish...

1266
01:06:57,920 --> 01:06:58,400
Uh...

1267
01:06:58,400 --> 01:06:59,100
So much more.

1268
01:06:59,380 --> 01:07:00,060
And...

1269
01:07:00,060 --> 01:07:01,320
Have them see...

1270
01:07:01,320 --> 01:07:02,560
All of these...

1271
01:07:02,560 --> 01:07:03,520
Sponsors...

1272
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:04,580
And merch...

1273
01:07:04,580 --> 01:07:06,000
That I'll be getting in the future...

1274
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:07,360
With their design.

1275
01:07:07,660 --> 01:07:08,340
Uh...

1276
01:07:08,340 --> 01:07:12,600
To make up for not having much in the past or being a little bit of a disappointment.

1277
01:07:16,040 --> 01:07:16,680
So...

1278
01:07:16,680 --> 01:07:19,020
I just want... and that's why...

1279
01:07:19,020 --> 01:07:22,780
I really wanted to go with them as my mama.

1280
01:07:22,980 --> 01:07:25,800
Because I wanted to make up for everything.

1281
01:07:26,280 --> 01:07:28,920
And I've really, really loved...

1282
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:32,080
All the stuff they've done.

1283
01:07:32,420 --> 01:07:35,220
And they've always been super, super, super supportive.

1284
01:07:35,220 --> 01:07:38,680
And I just really want to make them proud of me.

1285
01:07:39,020 --> 01:07:40,720
And that's why I...

1286
01:07:42,180 --> 01:07:45,640
Went with them as my new mama.

1287
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:49,600
And...

1288
01:07:52,080 --> 01:07:54,360
Yes, this will be...

1289
01:07:54,360 --> 01:07:56,480
My new skin suit.

1290
01:07:56,560 --> 01:08:01,160
But that doesn't mean my old one won't be used anymore.

1291
01:08:01,480 --> 01:08:03,240
Or stop being part of me.

1292
01:08:03,640 --> 01:08:05,120
We are gonna call it...

1293
01:08:05,120 --> 01:08:06,180
Retro Doki.

1294
01:08:07,080 --> 01:08:07,680
Because...

1295
01:08:08,580 --> 01:08:09,780
Retro Doki...

1296
01:08:09,780 --> 01:08:10,900
Has...

1297
01:08:10,900 --> 01:08:12,840
A lot of stuff coming out in the future.

1298
01:08:17,200 --> 01:08:17,800
Because...

1299
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:20,240
Some sponsors and...

1300
01:08:20,920 --> 01:08:22,940
Some merch line that's coming up.

1301
01:08:23,340 --> 01:08:28,420
They specifically requested that they really would like to have Retro Doki be a part of it.

1302
01:08:28,940 --> 01:08:30,920
And I agreed because, you know...

1303
01:08:30,920 --> 01:08:34,460
I'm more known as Retro Doki than I am current...

1304
01:08:34,460 --> 01:08:35,380
Yeehaw Doki.

1305
01:08:39,580 --> 01:08:40,700
And so...

1306
01:08:41,960 --> 01:08:43,840
Retro Doki is staying around.

1307
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:45,420
I might not be using the skin suit.

1308
01:08:45,680 --> 01:08:49,220
Like, often maybe like 1-2% or like, I don't know, 5%?

1309
01:08:49,380 --> 01:08:50,320
I don't know.

1310
01:08:51,480 --> 01:08:52,040
But...

1311
01:08:52,040 --> 01:08:55,720
We made a lot of memories with Retro Doki.

1312
01:08:56,380 --> 01:08:58,160
With the Retro Doki skin suit.

1313
01:08:58,240 --> 01:09:01,660
And like, Clea was an absolute great mama.

1314
01:09:02,580 --> 01:09:03,140
And...

1315
01:09:03,140 --> 01:09:03,760
Um...

1316
01:09:03,760 --> 01:09:05,760
Clea actually had a hand with like, designing.

1317
01:09:06,220 --> 01:09:06,680
Uh...

1318
01:09:06,680 --> 01:09:07,760
Working together with...

1319
01:09:08,760 --> 01:09:09,220
Uh...

1320
01:09:09,220 --> 01:09:10,300
With New Mama.

1321
01:09:11,120 --> 01:09:11,580
Regarding...

1322
01:09:11,580 --> 01:09:12,560
I'll show you guys the sketches.

1323
01:09:12,700 --> 01:09:13,640
I'll show you guys all the...

1324
01:09:13,640 --> 01:09:14,840
We went through so much.

1325
01:09:14,900 --> 01:09:16,280
I didn't know what the fuck I wanted.

1326
01:09:21,260 --> 01:09:21,720
Um...

1327
01:09:21,720 --> 01:09:23,900
I didn't know what I really wanted.

1328
01:09:24,100 --> 01:09:24,560
So...

1329
01:09:25,220 --> 01:09:25,680
Um...

1330
01:09:25,680 --> 01:09:28,100
We went through so many...

1331
01:09:29,260 --> 01:09:29,720
Um...

1332
01:09:29,720 --> 01:09:30,760
Design concepts.

1333
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:33,660
Before we finally settled to Bounty Hunting.

1334
01:09:33,660 --> 01:09:35,560
And I'll show you guys...

1335
01:09:35,560 --> 01:09:35,980
Uh...

1336
01:09:35,980 --> 01:09:36,660
What it looks...

1337
01:09:36,660 --> 01:09:38,080
What all the concepts and everything.

1338
01:09:38,400 --> 01:09:39,040
Because...

1339
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:39,600
Um...

1340
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:41,580
New and Old Mama were both...

1341
01:09:41,580 --> 01:09:43,160
Said yes to me showing...

1342
01:09:43,160 --> 01:09:43,680
Uh...

1343
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:45,020
Concept art for everything.

1344
01:09:45,180 --> 01:09:47,260
So I'll show you guys after the credits and everything.

1345
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:48,080
Anyway!

1346
01:09:49,260 --> 01:09:49,900
Um...

1347
01:09:50,800 --> 01:09:51,440
Anyway...

1348
01:09:51,440 --> 01:09:52,040
Uh...

1349
01:09:52,040 --> 01:09:52,640
Yes!

1350
01:09:52,740 --> 01:09:53,380
Celia...

1351
01:09:53,380 --> 01:09:54,600
We've announced this...

1352
01:09:54,600 --> 01:09:54,900
Uh...

1353
01:09:54,900 --> 01:09:55,960
During the charity.

1354
01:09:56,480 --> 01:09:57,120
Uh...

1355
01:09:57,400 --> 01:09:59,420
Celia was the papa.

1356
01:09:59,840 --> 01:10:00,480
Um...

1357
01:10:00,480 --> 01:10:02,560
She did an amazing job.

1358
01:10:02,820 --> 01:10:03,460
Because...

1359
01:10:03,460 --> 01:10:03,600
She did a very good job with this.

1360
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:08,800
Like She just...

1361
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:09,320
She just did the best!

1362
01:10:09,320 --> 01:10:09,340
Like...

1363
01:10:17,720 --> 01:10:18,520
She just did.

1364
01:10:18,520 --> 01:10:19,220
I haven't really done a very.

1365
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:21,040
The принципе...

1366
01:10:21,040 --> 01:10:21,120
That I've done a very.

1367
01:10:21,120 --> 01:10:21,240
Like...

1368
01:10:21,240 --> 01:10:21,540
Like...

1369
01:10:21,540 --> 01:10:21,740
Uh...

1370
01:10:22,360 --> 01:10:23,300
I think that...

1371
01:10:24,420 --> 01:10:26,180
I think that...

1372
01:10:26,180 --> 01:10:32,440
I'm not used to being super duper fluid.

1373
01:10:34,580 --> 01:10:35,900
Oh my god.

1374
01:10:36,060 --> 01:10:36,720
Anyway.

1375
01:10:39,560 --> 01:10:42,680
I'm gonna butcher your name, but I'm just gonna say Cho.

1376
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:48,620
Did the assistance and everything with helping Celia.

1377
01:10:48,820 --> 01:10:49,260
Bye!

1378
01:10:49,360 --> 01:10:50,320
My true form!

1379
01:10:50,980 --> 01:10:52,100
My true form!

1380
01:10:52,280 --> 01:10:54,700
Rice Diet-y is my true form.

1381
01:10:54,700 --> 01:10:58,780
They also updated my true form.

1382
01:10:58,860 --> 01:10:59,740
They added more...

1383
01:10:59,740 --> 01:11:03,300
They show me new accessories.

1384
01:11:05,460 --> 01:11:08,620
If you don't know who Rice Diet-y is, they are really...

1385
01:11:08,620 --> 01:11:11,460
They're famous Vocaloid artists.

1386
01:11:12,700 --> 01:11:15,020
And created Shrimp Miku.

1387
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:18,760
And they gave me a new hat.

1388
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:19,960
They gave me new hats.

1389
01:11:20,060 --> 01:11:23,240
And they like, pushed some new bones into me.

1390
01:11:23,420 --> 01:11:24,680
So they updated my...

1391
01:11:24,700 --> 01:11:28,020
My bone structure and stuff within the tomato form.

1392
01:11:28,240 --> 01:11:31,300
So I'll show you guys when we're at the green screen.

1393
01:11:31,580 --> 01:11:31,920
Oh sorry.

1394
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:33,660
When we're at the magenta screen.

1395
01:11:34,380 --> 01:11:37,160
I don't wanna take risks.

1396
01:11:37,360 --> 01:11:40,680
But when we're at the magenta slash purple screen.

1397
01:11:41,380 --> 01:11:47,040
I will show you the new updates to my true form that Rice Diet-y gave me.

1398
01:11:47,200 --> 01:11:48,340
It's not just a hat.

1399
01:11:48,520 --> 01:11:49,760
There's like many other things.

1400
01:11:50,040 --> 01:11:50,840
Oh my god.

1401
01:11:50,920 --> 01:11:51,140
Okay.

1402
01:11:51,180 --> 01:11:54,220
The funniest thing about my true form.

1403
01:11:54,220 --> 01:11:57,480
Is that they originally gave me Jiggle Physics.

1404
01:11:57,860 --> 01:11:59,300
But like, as a tomato.

1405
01:11:59,540 --> 01:12:01,260
It was so cursed.

1406
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:11,540
I had... I had... I had Boob Physics on the tomato.

1407
01:12:12,020 --> 01:12:13,280
And I was like, oh my god.

1408
01:12:13,360 --> 01:12:13,660
Okay.

1409
01:12:13,780 --> 01:12:14,580
I don't know.

1410
01:12:15,360 --> 01:12:20,020
And I asked... I asked to... I asked to limit that.

1411
01:12:20,340 --> 01:12:21,940
I'll show you guys later.

1412
01:12:22,180 --> 01:12:23,420
I'll show you guys.

1413
01:12:23,420 --> 01:12:25,420
I was a very sloshy tomato.

1414
01:12:25,820 --> 01:12:26,340
Anyway.

1415
01:12:26,480 --> 01:12:26,660
Alright.

1416
01:12:26,760 --> 01:12:28,140
Let's on to like...

1417
01:12:28,140 --> 01:12:29,180
Um...

1418
01:12:29,180 --> 01:12:31,000
The stream assets.

1419
01:12:31,440 --> 01:12:31,900
Alright.

1420
01:12:32,040 --> 01:12:33,100
The stream assets.

1421
01:12:33,460 --> 01:12:35,500
Uh... We have a new logo!

1422
01:12:36,040 --> 01:12:36,920
New ol' logo.

1423
01:12:37,080 --> 01:12:39,900
The creator of this new logo.

1424
01:12:40,040 --> 01:12:40,460
Wow!

1425
01:12:41,140 --> 01:12:42,400
Guys, please don't steal my logo.

1426
01:12:44,260 --> 01:12:45,400
Please don't...

1427
01:12:45,400 --> 01:12:47,260
Please don't screenshot and steal my logo.

1428
01:12:47,440 --> 01:12:49,320
Cause it was not supposed to be that HD.

1429
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:50,120
Anyway.

1430
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:51,000
So...

1431
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,200
We have a new logo now.

1432
01:12:53,420 --> 01:12:53,700
Yes!

1433
01:12:53,960 --> 01:12:54,860
A new logo!

1434
01:12:56,160 --> 01:12:56,600
Um...

1435
01:12:56,600 --> 01:13:01,980
And it is made by the creator of my very first logo.

1436
01:13:02,080 --> 01:13:03,960
The logo you see... I don't know if it's on the store...

1437
01:13:03,960 --> 01:13:05,220
If it got taken off the store yet.

1438
01:13:05,440 --> 01:13:06,000
Oh yeah.

1439
01:13:06,040 --> 01:13:06,720
I can wink by the way.

1440
01:13:09,180 --> 01:13:09,620
Um...

1441
01:13:10,840 --> 01:13:11,280
But...

1442
01:13:11,280 --> 01:13:13,140
Uh... We have a new logo.

1443
01:13:13,280 --> 01:13:15,580
And this would be my future logo.

1444
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:17,280
To represent Bounty Hunter me.

1445
01:13:17,720 --> 01:13:21,680
And this was actually made by the creator of my very first logo.

1446
01:13:21,680 --> 01:13:24,180
Uh... The one that I've been using everywhere.

1447
01:13:24,740 --> 01:13:26,880
Uh... By the way, I have no new headers.

1448
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:28,100
No new schedule overlay.

1449
01:13:28,680 --> 01:13:29,240
Uh...

1450
01:13:29,240 --> 01:13:31,340
No new... Like... I don't...

1451
01:13:31,340 --> 01:13:33,820
I did not invest in that.

1452
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:37,180
I'll do that later.

1453
01:13:37,360 --> 01:13:38,580
There was other priorities.

1454
01:13:39,080 --> 01:13:39,600
Anyway.

1455
01:13:39,660 --> 01:13:43,620
The reason why I didn't invest on all those other graphics is because like...

1456
01:13:43,620 --> 01:13:49,580
I only let a very, very limited amount of people know what I was gonna look like.

1457
01:13:49,680 --> 01:13:51,400
And because of that...

1458
01:13:51,400 --> 01:13:51,660
I didn't invest in all those other graphics.

1459
01:13:51,660 --> 01:13:55,660
I had to pick and choose who was gonna know what I was gonna look like.

1460
01:13:57,040 --> 01:13:59,480
Because the project team...

1461
01:13:59,480 --> 01:14:07,960
Only a very limited amount of people in the project team actually knew what I was gonna look like.

1462
01:14:08,140 --> 01:14:10,880
All the others were just given like a silhouette.

1463
01:14:11,400 --> 01:14:17,160
But those who had to work closely with what I look like now...

1464
01:14:17,160 --> 01:14:20,760
I DMed them directly and being like...

1465
01:14:20,760 --> 01:14:21,400
This is...

1466
01:14:21,660 --> 01:14:23,100
This is what it's gonna look like.

1467
01:14:23,180 --> 01:14:25,360
Because like I didn't... You know I'm an indie now.

1468
01:14:25,540 --> 01:14:26,500
And I was like... Oh my gosh.

1469
01:14:26,560 --> 01:14:27,440
I don't wanna make...

1470
01:14:27,440 --> 01:14:28,960
So many contracts.

1471
01:14:30,680 --> 01:14:32,040
Because I have to...

1472
01:14:32,040 --> 01:14:33,720
I have to pay my lawyer.

1473
01:14:34,360 --> 01:14:34,800
Uh...

1474
01:14:37,480 --> 01:14:38,360
Every time.

1475
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:40,080
For a contract.

1476
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:42,840
So...

1477
01:14:42,840 --> 01:14:44,060
I didn't wanna...

1478
01:14:45,660 --> 01:14:48,620
Do like 500,000 NDAs.

1479
01:14:48,620 --> 01:14:49,360
So I was just like...

1480
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:51,420
I trust you to not...

1481
01:14:51,660 --> 01:14:54,720
I trust you guys.

1482
01:14:56,460 --> 01:14:59,640
So the more people I give it to...

1483
01:14:59,640 --> 01:15:02,780
The more likely it's gonna get leaked.

1484
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:03,860
Because I was like...

1485
01:15:03,860 --> 01:15:04,340
Bro I don't...

1486
01:15:04,340 --> 01:15:05,720
I've already spent so much money.

1487
01:15:05,780 --> 01:15:07,000
I don't want this to get leaked.

1488
01:15:10,400 --> 01:15:11,860
I spent so much.

1489
01:15:11,960 --> 01:15:15,200
I don't want this skin to get leaked.

1490
01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:17,220
So yes.

1491
01:15:17,300 --> 01:15:18,100
We won't have...

1492
01:15:18,100 --> 01:15:19,760
We will get the assets later.

1493
01:15:20,460 --> 01:15:21,020
And...

1494
01:15:21,020 --> 01:15:21,320
I'm gonna go back to the...

1495
01:15:21,660 --> 01:15:21,900
Anyway.

1496
01:15:22,320 --> 01:15:24,280
I'll show you the back up logo though.

1497
01:15:24,380 --> 01:15:25,700
The back up logo we had.

1498
01:15:26,440 --> 01:15:28,100
That was made by...

1499
01:15:29,800 --> 01:15:30,200
SugarType.

1500
01:15:30,300 --> 01:15:32,520
I've always worked with SugarType a lot for logos.

1501
01:15:32,860 --> 01:15:33,940
And let me...

1502
01:15:33,940 --> 01:15:34,660
Oh my gosh.

1503
01:15:34,820 --> 01:15:35,460
Where is she?

1504
01:15:37,480 --> 01:15:38,180
I forgot.

1505
01:15:38,380 --> 01:15:39,480
I don't know where I saved it.

1506
01:15:39,580 --> 01:15:40,300
Give me a sec guys.

1507
01:15:40,440 --> 01:15:41,120
I'm a professional.

1508
01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:44,960
Alright.

1509
01:15:44,960 --> 01:15:46,580
I'll show you guys the back up logo.

1510
01:15:47,420 --> 01:15:48,600
Because by the way.

1511
01:15:48,600 --> 01:15:50,360
My first logo.

1512
01:15:51,540 --> 01:15:53,200
The reason why they're anonymous.

1513
01:15:53,320 --> 01:15:55,920
Is because they're planning on making a new account.

1514
01:15:56,320 --> 01:15:57,900
And they want it to be...

1515
01:15:57,900 --> 01:16:00,720
They don't want us to link to their old account.

1516
01:16:00,940 --> 01:16:01,360
Because...

1517
01:16:01,360 --> 01:16:03,280
The reason why I have a back up logo.

1518
01:16:03,640 --> 01:16:04,660
Was because...

1519
01:16:04,660 --> 01:16:07,440
This person that I've commissioned.

1520
01:16:07,560 --> 01:16:08,680
For the first logo.

1521
01:16:09,060 --> 01:16:12,280
That person was MIA for 3 years.

1522
01:16:12,540 --> 01:16:16,140
So I did not expect them to be back.

1523
01:16:17,020 --> 01:16:17,620
So I did not expect them to be back.

1524
01:16:17,620 --> 01:16:17,860
So I did not expect them to be back.

1525
01:16:17,980 --> 01:16:18,580
So I did not expect them to be back.

1526
01:16:18,600 --> 01:16:21,320
So I had a back up logo.

1527
01:16:21,500 --> 01:16:21,900
MIA.

1528
01:16:21,940 --> 01:16:23,080
Just in case.

1529
01:16:23,460 --> 01:16:25,180
Because I was like...

1530
01:16:25,180 --> 01:16:29,240
I really wanted my first logo.

1531
01:16:29,260 --> 01:16:30,720
MIA by my original logo artist.

1532
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:31,800
Because I really love their logo.

1533
01:16:32,560 --> 01:16:34,920
So I asked SugarType.

1534
01:16:34,980 --> 01:16:36,880
If they could edit a back up logo.

1535
01:16:37,160 --> 01:16:37,800
In advance.

1536
01:16:38,260 --> 01:16:38,780
Alright.

1537
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:40,380
Please don't steal this logo too.

1538
01:16:40,880 --> 01:16:43,240
But this is what the back up logo.

1539
01:16:43,740 --> 01:16:44,640
Looks like.

1540
01:16:45,240 --> 01:16:46,260
So like...

1541
01:16:46,260 --> 01:16:48,200
As like the interim logo.

1542
01:16:51,920 --> 01:16:52,320
So...

1543
01:16:52,320 --> 01:16:54,220
This is the...

1544
01:16:54,220 --> 01:16:55,620
This was the back up logo.

1545
01:16:55,920 --> 01:16:56,260
And I still...

1546
01:16:56,260 --> 01:16:56,980
I wanted to show you guys.

1547
01:16:57,060 --> 01:17:00,600
When I commissioned SugarType.

1548
01:17:00,640 --> 01:17:01,140
For this logo.

1549
01:17:01,220 --> 01:17:04,560
I let her know that it was going to be a back up logo.

1550
01:17:06,660 --> 01:17:07,760
Because I did one...

1551
01:17:07,760 --> 01:17:09,580
I didn't want just like an edited version.

1552
01:17:09,640 --> 01:17:10,440
Of my old logo.

1553
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:11,860
But it was just...

1554
01:17:11,860 --> 01:17:13,820
I wanted to have as like an interim.

1555
01:17:14,100 --> 01:17:15,080
Like a place holder.

1556
01:17:15,260 --> 01:17:17,960
Until I find someone to make my newer logo.

1557
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:18,800
And I didn't want to do that anymore.

1558
01:17:19,920 --> 01:17:20,800
But yes.

1559
01:17:20,900 --> 01:17:21,880
This is the back up logo.

1560
01:17:22,360 --> 01:17:24,240
But this is the main logo.

1561
01:17:25,400 --> 01:17:26,940
So I will be using this.

1562
01:17:27,100 --> 01:17:28,300
But I had it just in case.

1563
01:17:28,520 --> 01:17:31,020
But this will be my new logo.

1564
01:17:31,740 --> 01:17:33,180
It reminds me of...

1565
01:17:33,180 --> 01:17:34,320
Dragon Ball Z somehow.

1566
01:17:35,660 --> 01:17:37,680
It reminds me a little bit of Dragon Ball Z.

1567
01:17:38,500 --> 01:17:38,980
Anyway.

1568
01:17:39,980 --> 01:17:41,100
My chat overlay.

1569
01:17:41,260 --> 01:17:42,480
It is Sig.

1570
01:17:43,700 --> 01:17:45,120
And they've made...

1571
01:17:45,120 --> 01:17:46,400
A lot of chat overlays.

1572
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:47,960
A lot of my chat overlays.

1573
01:17:47,980 --> 01:17:48,840
Over the years.

1574
01:17:49,360 --> 01:17:51,480
So it's not really a surprise.

1575
01:17:52,640 --> 01:17:53,580
And then...

1576
01:17:53,580 --> 01:17:55,880
I worked with a new artist.

1577
01:17:56,260 --> 01:17:58,960
It was a recommendation from one of my older artists.

1578
01:17:59,220 --> 01:18:00,140
You might recognize.

1579
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:02,480
Um...

1580
01:18:02,480 --> 01:18:04,400
This is actually like...

1581
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:06,900
I had a great time working with this artist.

1582
01:18:07,240 --> 01:18:07,800
Name.

1583
01:18:08,240 --> 01:18:10,580
Because the background looks amazing.

1584
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:11,820
I actually...

1585
01:18:11,820 --> 01:18:12,820
It blew me away.

1586
01:18:13,360 --> 01:18:15,380
My instructions I gave to them was that...

1587
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:18,260
I wanted to have a Saloon background.

1588
01:18:18,640 --> 01:18:20,320
And I wanted to be based off...

1589
01:18:20,320 --> 01:18:21,540
Some of the sketches.

1590
01:18:22,300 --> 01:18:24,360
Related to the splash art from the game.

1591
01:18:24,500 --> 01:18:25,660
The fake game.

1592
01:18:26,600 --> 01:18:27,040
Um...

1593
01:18:27,740 --> 01:18:28,180
And...

1594
01:18:29,640 --> 01:18:32,220
It was a recommendation from another background artist.

1595
01:18:32,340 --> 01:18:33,460
That I used to work with a lot.

1596
01:18:33,820 --> 01:18:35,020
From Shigo.

1597
01:18:35,380 --> 01:18:38,020
Who recommended Name to work with me.

1598
01:18:38,100 --> 01:18:40,640
Because their calendar was fully...

1599
01:18:41,380 --> 01:18:41,820
Booked.

1600
01:18:41,820 --> 01:18:42,820
So then I was like...

1601
01:18:42,820 --> 01:18:43,060
You know what?

1602
01:18:43,120 --> 01:18:43,680
I'm going to take a shot.

1603
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:47,660
I trust your recommendation.

1604
01:18:48,120 --> 01:18:48,940
So yeah!

1605
01:18:49,740 --> 01:18:50,380
Hahaha!

1606
01:18:51,900 --> 01:18:52,760
Me flew!

1607
01:18:53,080 --> 01:18:54,560
It was the ending screen.

1608
01:18:54,960 --> 01:18:57,820
This is why yesterday I did not show the ending screen.

1609
01:18:57,900 --> 01:18:59,140
My usual ending screen.

1610
01:18:59,380 --> 01:19:01,800
Because yesterday I was...

1611
01:19:02,180 --> 01:19:04,360
I already swapped it to...

1612
01:19:04,360 --> 01:19:05,700
Like you know...

1613
01:19:05,700 --> 01:19:07,900
To my new skin suit ending screen.

1614
01:19:08,220 --> 01:19:09,480
And so I was like...

1615
01:19:09,480 --> 01:19:10,540
Alright we're not going to...

1616
01:19:12,280 --> 01:19:14,140
I need to make sure...

1617
01:19:14,140 --> 01:19:16,020
I don't accidentally show it.

1618
01:19:16,360 --> 01:19:16,940
Wooo!

1619
01:19:17,220 --> 01:19:17,940
Hahaha!

1620
01:19:18,460 --> 01:19:19,160
Hahaha!

1621
01:19:20,280 --> 01:19:22,540
And that's why we had a little...

1622
01:19:22,540 --> 01:19:25,160
A bit of a different thing.

1623
01:19:25,480 --> 01:19:26,020
Also!

1624
01:19:26,220 --> 01:19:26,780
E-votes!

1625
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:27,320
Yes!

1626
01:19:27,540 --> 01:19:28,860
I commissioned...

1627
01:19:28,860 --> 01:19:31,760
Claire and one of my...

1628
01:19:31,760 --> 01:19:32,720
Really good friends.

1629
01:19:32,960 --> 01:19:36,340
We've been friends for 15 plus years.

1630
01:19:36,720 --> 01:19:37,940
That lazy rat.

1631
01:19:38,300 --> 01:19:39,980
We've been friends since...

1632
01:19:39,980 --> 01:19:41,700
We were little.

1633
01:19:42,220 --> 01:19:42,940
So...

1634
01:19:44,140 --> 01:19:44,700
That lazy rat.

1635
01:19:44,960 --> 01:19:46,760
They've gone through a lot of...

1636
01:19:46,760 --> 01:19:48,540
You might recognize them as either...

1637
01:19:48,540 --> 01:19:51,280
Ken or Kuro.

1638
01:19:51,720 --> 01:19:53,560
We've been friends for like...

1639
01:19:54,280 --> 01:19:55,860
15 plus years.

1640
01:19:56,260 --> 01:19:57,720
They had many accounts.

1641
01:19:58,060 --> 01:19:58,580
Hahaha!

1642
01:19:58,700 --> 01:20:01,620
I worked with them with emotes and...

1643
01:20:02,720 --> 01:20:04,100
Like in our past...

1644
01:20:04,100 --> 01:20:05,200
As artists and stuff.

1645
01:20:06,220 --> 01:20:07,360
I've known...

1646
01:20:07,360 --> 01:20:10,480
I've known Ken...

1647
01:20:11,220 --> 01:20:11,880
Longer...

1648
01:20:11,880 --> 01:20:13,120
Than Gumi.

1649
01:20:14,140 --> 01:20:14,380
Hahaha!

1650
01:20:15,740 --> 01:20:16,220
Hahaha!

1651
01:20:18,020 --> 01:20:18,500
Um...

1652
01:20:19,700 --> 01:20:20,660
And so...

1653
01:20:20,660 --> 01:20:21,660
We're gonna...

1654
01:20:21,660 --> 01:20:24,160
Also like... rats' emotes...

1655
01:20:24,160 --> 01:20:25,720
Were needed to edit because...

1656
01:20:25,720 --> 01:20:27,420
They were like...

1657
01:20:27,420 --> 01:20:29,140
Oh I thought you had one glove on.

1658
01:20:29,400 --> 01:20:30,920
I was like... No it's two gloves.

1659
01:20:31,840 --> 01:20:33,600
So they sent me the fixed version.

1660
01:20:33,800 --> 01:20:35,600
But I didn't have time to make a graphic for it.

1661
01:20:35,780 --> 01:20:36,220
But!

1662
01:20:36,820 --> 01:20:38,480
You might recognize these emotes.

1663
01:20:38,480 --> 01:20:40,140
Because they were my favorite emotes.

1664
01:20:40,220 --> 01:20:40,620
Hahaha!

1665
01:20:43,460 --> 01:20:45,020
Monkey is back!

1666
01:20:45,820 --> 01:20:46,440
Hahaha!

1667
01:20:47,660 --> 01:20:48,400
Hahaha!

1668
01:20:50,500 --> 01:20:51,240
Um...

1669
01:20:51,240 --> 01:20:54,100
We have... Monkey is back.

1670
01:20:54,380 --> 01:20:55,320
And so...

1671
01:20:55,320 --> 01:20:57,500
Yes the gloves... It's supposed to be two gloves.

1672
01:20:57,840 --> 01:20:59,140
Two... But then like...

1673
01:20:59,140 --> 01:21:01,800
He read the reference sheet wrong.

1674
01:21:02,100 --> 01:21:02,820
So...

1675
01:21:02,820 --> 01:21:03,640
Hahaha!

1676
01:21:06,140 --> 01:21:06,880
Um...

1677
01:21:08,480 --> 01:21:09,080
So like...

1678
01:21:10,080 --> 01:21:12,120
I have the edited version of it.

1679
01:21:12,380 --> 01:21:14,660
And so I'm gonna swap it back.

1680
01:21:14,980 --> 01:21:18,300
Like I'll... I just was too lazy to make a new...

1681
01:21:18,300 --> 01:21:18,460
Uh...

1682
01:21:18,460 --> 01:21:20,380
They sent me the fixed version while I was streaming.

1683
01:21:20,560 --> 01:21:22,060
So like I couldn't fix it.

1684
01:21:22,180 --> 01:21:22,660
You know?

1685
01:21:22,740 --> 01:21:24,380
There's also a reason why we don't have...

1686
01:21:24,380 --> 01:21:26,420
We're not gonna be like super fast with changing emotes.

1687
01:21:26,460 --> 01:21:27,340
Because like I said...

1688
01:21:27,340 --> 01:21:28,860
I was worried of leaking...

1689
01:21:28,860 --> 01:21:30,220
I was worried of the...

1690
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:33,020
Worry of my skinsuit getting leaked.

1691
01:21:33,200 --> 01:21:35,300
So I just like commissioned like...

1692
01:21:35,300 --> 01:21:35,820
You know...

1693
01:21:35,820 --> 01:21:38,160
My old mama and one of my best friends.

1694
01:21:38,540 --> 01:21:39,700
Um... And being like...

1695
01:21:39,700 --> 01:21:40,240
Alright...

1696
01:21:41,620 --> 01:21:43,700
We'll get these emotes for now.

1697
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:45,320
It's why I haven't updated my emotes.

1698
01:21:45,340 --> 01:21:48,580
Because I want to slowly swap my emotes to...

1699
01:21:49,420 --> 01:21:49,900
Um...

1700
01:21:49,900 --> 01:21:51,320
To my...

1701
01:21:53,780 --> 01:21:55,160
New skinsuit and stuff.

1702
01:21:55,280 --> 01:21:55,680
So yes!

1703
01:21:56,040 --> 01:21:57,000
Ship is back!

1704
01:21:57,620 --> 01:21:58,100
Finally!

1705
01:21:58,320 --> 01:22:00,500
Now you guys can spam the ship every time.

1706
01:22:00,560 --> 01:22:02,720
I was like thank you for the five gifted ships.

1707
01:22:02,720 --> 01:22:04,260
But I'll be adding these...

1708
01:22:04,260 --> 01:22:06,260
I don't know... Tomorrow or today.

1709
01:22:06,340 --> 01:22:07,740
Depending on how dead I am.

1710
01:22:07,980 --> 01:22:08,520
Today!

1711
01:22:09,820 --> 01:22:11,940
Depending on how dead I am today.

1712
01:22:12,260 --> 01:22:13,240
Um... Alright.

1713
01:22:13,400 --> 01:22:14,260
Next credit.

1714
01:22:14,680 --> 01:22:15,840
Where's my slideshow?

1715
01:22:16,060 --> 01:22:16,980
Where is it?

1716
01:22:17,060 --> 01:22:17,280
Alright.

1717
01:22:17,720 --> 01:22:18,260
Alright!

1718
01:22:18,420 --> 01:22:19,120
Stream assets!

1719
01:22:19,320 --> 01:22:20,620
We're not at the team yet.

1720
01:22:20,660 --> 01:22:21,880
We're not at the project team yet.

1721
01:22:22,020 --> 01:22:22,960
But yes!

1722
01:22:23,060 --> 01:22:24,780
We had four different...

1723
01:22:24,780 --> 01:22:26,500
Composers composing songs.

1724
01:22:26,920 --> 01:22:28,820
Because I wanted variations...

1725
01:22:28,820 --> 01:22:31,060
Of the music tracks...

1726
01:22:31,060 --> 01:22:31,480
And everything.

1727
01:22:32,720 --> 01:22:33,640
And so...

1728
01:22:33,640 --> 01:22:35,480
Huge shoutout to all those composers!

1729
01:22:35,820 --> 01:22:37,120
I was like, are you guys able to do it?

1730
01:22:37,160 --> 01:22:37,700
And they were like, YEAH!

1731
01:22:38,160 --> 01:22:39,700
And so... huge shoutout.

1732
01:22:39,720 --> 01:22:41,740
NowNor actually made my original...

1733
01:22:43,180 --> 01:22:45,040
BGMs for RetroDoki.

1734
01:22:45,280 --> 01:22:46,700
And I asked if they were free.

1735
01:22:46,880 --> 01:22:48,060
And then I decided...

1736
01:22:48,060 --> 01:22:50,760
Because I like... I wanted to experiment with...

1737
01:22:50,760 --> 01:22:52,100
Working with different composers.

1738
01:22:52,500 --> 01:22:53,480
And then like... you know...

1739
01:22:53,480 --> 01:22:55,680
Just experiment with different composers.

1740
01:22:56,120 --> 01:22:58,040
And different styles and stuff.

1741
01:22:58,180 --> 01:22:59,020
Because it helps.

1742
01:22:59,160 --> 01:23:00,680
Usually when I work with somebody...

1743
01:23:00,680 --> 01:23:02,400
I always go back to them.

1744
01:23:02,720 --> 01:23:04,100
So I like working...

1745
01:23:04,100 --> 01:23:05,960
Like finding people that I'm like...

1746
01:23:05,960 --> 01:23:08,300
Alright, I really like this style.

1747
01:23:08,440 --> 01:23:09,680
I have a project in mind.

1748
01:23:11,160 --> 01:23:12,620
That will fit this style.

1749
01:23:12,880 --> 01:23:13,840
So it helps a lot.

1750
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:15,580
I don't know if you guys know this.

1751
01:23:15,640 --> 01:23:17,520
But I tend to work with the same people...

1752
01:23:18,040 --> 01:23:19,680
A lot when it comes to projects.

1753
01:23:19,880 --> 01:23:20,940
Because like... you know...

1754
01:23:20,940 --> 01:23:22,280
We've already had experience together.

1755
01:23:22,720 --> 01:23:23,700
And I trust them.

1756
01:23:23,820 --> 01:23:26,100
I worked with a lot of new people for this one.

1757
01:23:26,260 --> 01:23:27,020
As you guys can see.

1758
01:23:27,240 --> 01:23:28,540
Like 30 plus people.

1759
01:23:30,040 --> 01:23:32,800
I worked with a lot of new people.

1760
01:23:34,240 --> 01:23:34,880
So...

1761
01:23:34,880 --> 01:23:36,540
Naonor, Zefisona...

1762
01:23:37,740 --> 01:23:38,380
Eya...

1763
01:23:38,380 --> 01:23:39,540
And Athoril...

1764
01:23:40,380 --> 01:23:42,820
Composed most of the music for it.

1765
01:23:42,900 --> 01:23:44,600
We actually have somebody in the...

1766
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:46,700
Main project team.

1767
01:23:46,840 --> 01:23:48,580
That composed some of the game music too.

1768
01:23:50,500 --> 01:23:50,820
So...

1769
01:23:51,580 --> 01:23:52,860
The video...

1770
01:23:52,860 --> 01:23:54,940
The Spongebob reference.

1771
01:23:56,160 --> 01:23:56,800
Hahaha...

1772
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:57,260
Hahaha...

1773
01:23:58,160 --> 01:24:00,360
Was done by one of my shorts editors.

1774
01:24:02,200 --> 01:24:04,840
Nashe124 He did the Tamayo reveal.

1775
01:24:05,060 --> 01:24:06,220
And the great...

1776
01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:09,640
Sorry I'm blocking your name right now.

1777
01:24:10,300 --> 01:24:12,140
The great Kaitsu...

1778
01:24:12,140 --> 01:24:14,900
Did the voice acting.

1779
01:24:15,100 --> 01:24:15,620
I was like...

1780
01:24:15,620 --> 01:24:16,600
I gave the video...

1781
01:24:16,600 --> 01:24:17,720
I was like Spongebob.

1782
01:24:19,020 --> 01:24:19,620
Hahaha...

1783
01:24:20,960 --> 01:24:22,780
They've done voice acting for...

1784
01:24:22,780 --> 01:24:24,140
Various other things I've done.

1785
01:24:24,420 --> 01:24:25,260
So like the...

1786
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:27,080
Voice actor.

1787
01:24:27,300 --> 01:24:28,140
Whenever I have an idea.

1788
01:24:28,500 --> 01:24:29,200
Cause I was like...

1789
01:24:29,200 --> 01:24:30,980
Well your voice actor.

1790
01:24:31,300 --> 01:24:33,080
And you have a really big range.

1791
01:24:33,380 --> 01:24:34,260
And uh...

1792
01:24:34,960 --> 01:24:37,920
I'm gonna go with you for any future projects I have.

1793
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:39,060
Related to voice acting.

1794
01:24:39,200 --> 01:24:40,920
And I need male voice number one.

1795
01:24:42,220 --> 01:24:42,780
Hahaha...

1796
01:24:45,240 --> 01:24:46,720
Anytime I was like...

1797
01:24:46,720 --> 01:24:48,820
I need male voice number one.

1798
01:24:49,580 --> 01:24:51,240
I hit him up.

1799
01:24:51,340 --> 01:24:52,980
Cause he's like the best.

1800
01:24:53,200 --> 01:24:54,620
He did the...

1801
01:24:56,800 --> 01:24:58,280
Batman one for us.

1802
01:24:58,380 --> 01:24:59,180
In the past.

1803
01:24:59,640 --> 01:25:00,420
And so...

1804
01:25:00,920 --> 01:25:03,380
By the way he sent me like three versions.

1805
01:25:03,740 --> 01:25:05,580
It got longer and longer and longer.

1806
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:07,360
Cause at one point he was like...

1807
01:25:07,360 --> 01:25:10,700
The more you don't respond the longer I am gonna make this.

1808
01:25:10,980 --> 01:25:12,520
So then I took all of them.

1809
01:25:12,620 --> 01:25:13,980
And then I just sent it to my editor.

1810
01:25:14,180 --> 01:25:15,800
And was like alright I don't know.

1811
01:25:15,960 --> 01:25:16,800
Just pick one.

1812
01:25:18,020 --> 01:25:18,500
Hahaha...

1813
01:25:19,680 --> 01:25:20,160
Hahaha...

1814
01:25:23,320 --> 01:25:23,800
Hahaha...

1815
01:25:23,800 --> 01:25:24,000
Um...

1816
01:25:24,620 --> 01:25:26,500
Yes he did the Batman short.

1817
01:25:26,700 --> 01:25:28,860
He was the voice actor for the Batman short.

1818
01:25:29,120 --> 01:25:30,120
And then RetroVis!

1819
01:25:30,260 --> 01:25:32,600
I love working with RetroVis for my teasers!

1820
01:25:32,980 --> 01:25:33,840
It's so good.

1821
01:25:33,920 --> 01:25:34,620
It's so creative.

1822
01:25:34,800 --> 01:25:38,240
I love their style when it comes to teaser videos.

1823
01:25:38,680 --> 01:25:40,100
And um...

1824
01:25:40,100 --> 01:25:41,240
I will always...

1825
01:25:41,240 --> 01:25:43,520
If I ever have a chance I will always work with RetroVis.

1826
01:25:43,600 --> 01:25:44,680
When it comes to like...

1827
01:25:45,140 --> 01:25:46,360
Videos like this.

1828
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:47,260
Um...

1829
01:25:49,680 --> 01:25:50,600
But yes...

1830
01:25:51,300 --> 01:25:51,780
Um...

1831
01:25:51,780 --> 01:25:53,820
That is the assets.

1832
01:25:53,960 --> 01:25:55,480
I think after that is the project team.

1833
01:25:55,640 --> 01:25:56,340
Project team!

1834
01:25:56,600 --> 01:25:57,080
Alright!

1835
01:25:57,680 --> 01:25:58,160
Management!

1836
01:25:58,460 --> 01:26:00,620
Alright so these were the people who were...

1837
01:26:00,620 --> 01:26:02,260
In charge of like...

1838
01:26:02,260 --> 01:26:04,660
Because there were 30 plus people I couldn't be...

1839
01:26:04,660 --> 01:26:06,740
On the server 24-7 obviously.

1840
01:26:07,020 --> 01:26:07,500
So...

1841
01:26:07,500 --> 01:26:10,280
We had a day a day channel for me that was like...

1842
01:26:10,280 --> 01:26:10,720
By the way!

1843
01:26:10,980 --> 01:26:12,160
Behind the scenes stuff.

1844
01:26:12,340 --> 01:26:14,160
I will be talking about behind the scenes stuff.

1845
01:26:14,400 --> 01:26:15,340
On Tuesday.

1846
01:26:15,700 --> 01:26:17,580
The day after cause like tomorrow I'm taking a break.

1847
01:26:18,660 --> 01:26:19,140
Hahaha...

1848
01:26:20,600 --> 01:26:22,440
Usually I don't stream on Sunday.

1849
01:26:22,940 --> 01:26:23,500
Hahaha...

1850
01:26:24,100 --> 01:26:26,720
But on Tuesday I will be...

1851
01:26:26,720 --> 01:26:28,220
Talking about behind the scenes of everything.

1852
01:26:28,500 --> 01:26:30,660
Giving you guys the work in progress shots.

1853
01:26:30,860 --> 01:26:32,420
Of all the work in progress stuff.

1854
01:26:32,660 --> 01:26:35,060
And everything that goes into it.

1855
01:26:35,840 --> 01:26:36,400
Um...

1856
01:26:36,400 --> 01:26:38,220
Before I want to talk about the project team.

1857
01:26:38,280 --> 01:26:40,280
Before I talk about this.

1858
01:26:40,420 --> 01:26:42,360
I want to say uh...

1859
01:26:42,360 --> 01:26:45,060
The project team has worked...

1860
01:26:45,060 --> 01:26:46,180
Incredibly...

1861
01:26:46,840 --> 01:26:48,380
Incredibly hard on this.

1862
01:26:48,380 --> 01:26:48,840
We had...

1863
01:26:48,840 --> 01:26:51,120
The reason why we had 6 plus loops.

1864
01:26:51,300 --> 01:26:54,520
Is because I had additional notes that I had to give.

1865
01:26:54,600 --> 01:26:55,400
Regarding the audio.

1866
01:26:55,960 --> 01:26:56,420
Um...

1867
01:26:56,420 --> 01:26:59,580
So like they were like last minute rendering and stuff.

1868
01:27:00,020 --> 01:27:00,500
Um...

1869
01:27:00,500 --> 01:27:04,200
The video I sent there was like a lot of sound effects were missing.

1870
01:27:04,460 --> 01:27:05,200
And I noticed that.

1871
01:27:05,360 --> 01:27:08,040
And so we had to add sound effects and stuff.

1872
01:27:08,480 --> 01:27:09,000
Um...

1873
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:10,200
And uh...

1874
01:27:10,200 --> 01:27:13,460
Cause I really wanted to have the immersive feeling of a video game.

1875
01:27:13,560 --> 01:27:14,180
Like you're actually...

1876
01:27:14,180 --> 01:27:15,400
Like it's not just a regular video.

1877
01:27:15,600 --> 01:27:18,920
Like you're actually in a made up video game.

1878
01:27:19,100 --> 01:27:20,900
That I fucking created.

1879
01:27:21,040 --> 01:27:21,240
Like...

1880
01:27:21,700 --> 01:27:23,140
That was in my head.

1881
01:27:27,880 --> 01:27:28,280
So...

1882
01:27:29,320 --> 01:27:29,720
Um...

1883
01:27:29,720 --> 01:27:32,660
This is actually like the most I've ever recorded for a project.

1884
01:27:33,420 --> 01:27:33,820
And...

1885
01:27:33,820 --> 01:27:35,260
It was the most expensive to date.

1886
01:27:35,320 --> 01:27:36,560
I won't say how much it cost.

1887
01:27:36,720 --> 01:27:38,700
I'll leave that in the member stream one day.

1888
01:27:38,760 --> 01:27:39,660
And I'll have a trigger warning.

1889
01:27:40,020 --> 01:27:40,620
Trigger warning.

1890
01:27:40,620 --> 01:27:42,000
Financial Irresponsibilities.

1891
01:27:42,260 --> 01:27:42,940
Hahahaha.

1892
01:27:45,580 --> 01:27:46,260
So...

1893
01:27:46,260 --> 01:27:47,040
Um...

1894
01:27:47,040 --> 01:27:48,720
And because of that...

1895
01:27:48,720 --> 01:27:52,120
I really wanted to...

1896
01:27:52,120 --> 01:27:54,260
Give like a huge shout out to them.

1897
01:27:54,460 --> 01:27:55,880
Also for putting up with me.

1898
01:27:56,320 --> 01:27:57,000
Um...

1899
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:58,320
Because I was like...

1900
01:27:58,320 --> 01:28:01,160
I have more notes.

1901
01:28:01,600 --> 01:28:02,280
Hahahaha.

1902
01:28:05,100 --> 01:28:05,780
So...

1903
01:28:05,780 --> 01:28:08,000
I'm sorry if I was super blunt.

1904
01:28:08,360 --> 01:28:09,040
Sometimes.

1905
01:28:09,040 --> 01:28:11,200
But when I get overworked...

1906
01:28:11,740 --> 01:28:12,360
Not overworked.

1907
01:28:12,360 --> 01:28:13,120
When I get overwhelmed.

1908
01:28:13,660 --> 01:28:15,380
I've been really stressed out lately.

1909
01:28:15,660 --> 01:28:17,440
I don't fluff my words at all.

1910
01:28:17,500 --> 01:28:18,560
I just go like...

1911
01:28:18,560 --> 01:28:19,540
Fix this.

1912
01:28:20,120 --> 01:28:20,720
Hahahaha.

1913
01:28:23,140 --> 01:28:24,340
But yes...

1914
01:28:24,340 --> 01:28:25,060
Um...

1915
01:28:27,360 --> 01:28:30,480
Nova, Wisteria, Mr. Lex in the management team.

1916
01:28:30,720 --> 01:28:33,220
As well as project director was Nova.

1917
01:28:33,880 --> 01:28:34,480
Um...

1918
01:28:34,480 --> 01:28:35,860
And we have OnlyPilot.

1919
01:28:35,920 --> 01:28:37,700
Who you might recognize.

1920
01:28:39,040 --> 01:28:40,240
Because I've worked with OnlyPilot.

1921
01:28:40,340 --> 01:28:41,240
A lot.

1922
01:28:41,320 --> 01:28:42,420
A lot, lot, lot.

1923
01:28:42,560 --> 01:28:43,700
For a lot of my projects.

1924
01:28:43,880 --> 01:28:46,280
And honestly their graphics is like...

1925
01:28:46,280 --> 01:28:47,920
One of my favorite styles.

1926
01:28:48,400 --> 01:28:50,040
In terms of their graphics.

1927
01:28:50,220 --> 01:28:52,720
And they did the production lead and GUI.

1928
01:28:52,780 --> 01:28:55,100
I messaged...

1929
01:28:55,100 --> 01:28:56,680
A guild.

1930
01:28:56,800 --> 01:28:57,380
For this.

1931
01:28:57,860 --> 01:28:59,760
Because I message...

1932
01:29:00,380 --> 01:29:01,340
Rigor Mortis.

1933
01:29:01,820 --> 01:29:03,220
If you guys know the guild.

1934
01:29:03,960 --> 01:29:06,880
And they compiled majority of the people.

1935
01:29:06,920 --> 01:29:07,780
That's part of the team.

1936
01:29:09,040 --> 01:29:11,020
I brought in 3D people.

1937
01:29:11,480 --> 01:29:12,040
Um...

1938
01:29:12,040 --> 01:29:14,180
Because I had lots of experience.

1939
01:29:14,920 --> 01:29:17,400
Working with the 3D...

1940
01:29:17,400 --> 01:29:18,180
Uh...

1941
01:29:18,180 --> 01:29:18,780
Team.

1942
01:29:19,720 --> 01:29:20,280
And...

1943
01:29:20,280 --> 01:29:23,140
I personally...

1944
01:29:23,140 --> 01:29:24,540
I DM'ed the guild.

1945
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:25,800
Mortis Guild.

1946
01:29:26,040 --> 01:29:29,220
And a lot of these people come from the Mortis Guild.

1947
01:29:29,560 --> 01:29:31,320
That were recruited into this.

1948
01:29:31,440 --> 01:29:33,040
And it was a huge team.

1949
01:29:33,300 --> 01:29:34,460
Because I was like...

1950
01:29:34,460 --> 01:29:35,120
Money.

1951
01:29:35,580 --> 01:29:38,280
Don't worry about how much it costs.

1952
01:29:39,580 --> 01:29:40,780
I was like...

1953
01:29:40,780 --> 01:29:41,800
I was like...

1954
01:29:42,300 --> 01:29:43,620
Don't worry about the budget.

1955
01:29:43,740 --> 01:29:44,280
They were like... What's the budget?

1956
01:29:44,380 --> 01:29:45,140
There is no budget.

1957
01:29:45,900 --> 01:29:49,100
There is no budget.

1958
01:29:49,840 --> 01:29:52,680
So bring in as many people as you want.

1959
01:29:57,680 --> 01:29:58,280
Um...

1960
01:29:59,160 --> 01:30:01,080
Because this was very ambitious.

1961
01:30:01,080 --> 01:30:02,200
You guys can tell.

1962
01:30:02,320 --> 01:30:03,440
It was so ambitious.

1963
01:30:03,940 --> 01:30:07,120
I've had this idea for the longest time.

1964
01:30:07,300 --> 01:30:09,160
This idea has been...

1965
01:30:09,160 --> 01:30:11,700
Something I had for a year now.

1966
01:30:12,020 --> 01:30:12,920
It's been an idea.

1967
01:30:13,200 --> 01:30:14,040
So I'm really happy.

1968
01:30:14,160 --> 01:30:16,880
I can finally implement it.

1969
01:30:17,200 --> 01:30:17,800
Hahahaha.

1970
01:30:19,420 --> 01:30:20,020
Anyway.

1971
01:30:20,660 --> 01:30:23,000
Pionee did the GUI logo.

1972
01:30:23,280 --> 01:30:24,380
So like the logos you see.

1973
01:30:24,460 --> 01:30:26,240
Like Doki Burst and the game icons.

1974
01:30:26,600 --> 01:30:27,880
And everything.

1975
01:30:28,440 --> 01:30:28,960
Um...

1976
01:30:31,080 --> 01:30:31,940
I'm really happy with the logos.

1977
01:30:32,800 --> 01:30:33,400
Alright.

1978
01:30:33,520 --> 01:30:34,180
Next slide.

1979
01:30:35,380 --> 01:30:35,980
Uh...

1980
01:30:35,980 --> 01:30:36,920
Wooo!

1981
01:30:36,980 --> 01:30:38,200
The art team!

1982
01:30:38,260 --> 01:30:40,000
I brought in some of the artists as well.

1983
01:30:40,220 --> 01:30:42,640
You might recognize a lot of these artists.

1984
01:30:42,940 --> 01:30:43,480
Uh...

1985
01:30:43,480 --> 01:30:46,500
That worked on this.

1986
01:30:47,280 --> 01:30:48,300
By the way.

1987
01:30:48,460 --> 01:30:50,160
I was going to tell this later.

1988
01:30:50,600 --> 01:30:51,200
But...

1989
01:30:51,980 --> 01:30:54,160
The splash art you guys saw.

1990
01:30:54,400 --> 01:30:58,040
The splash art will be free to download.

1991
01:30:58,240 --> 01:30:58,840
Later.

1992
01:30:58,920 --> 01:31:00,160
In the community post.

1993
01:31:01,080 --> 01:31:01,380
On YouTube.

1994
01:31:02,020 --> 01:31:02,460
So...

1995
01:31:02,460 --> 01:31:05,060
Did I usually make it on the community post?

1996
01:31:05,200 --> 01:31:06,100
Or just give you guys a link?

1997
01:31:06,360 --> 01:31:08,100
I'm going to tweet out the link.

1998
01:31:08,620 --> 01:31:10,220
All the splash arts you guys saw.

1999
01:31:11,580 --> 01:31:13,560
From the fake game.

2000
01:31:13,980 --> 01:31:16,700
Will be made into free wallpapers.

2001
01:31:16,700 --> 01:31:17,560
For all you guys.

2002
01:31:17,680 --> 01:31:19,320
The animation on the other hand.

2003
01:31:19,420 --> 01:31:21,240
Just like usually.

2004
01:31:22,520 --> 01:31:23,800
Like in the past.

2005
01:31:23,960 --> 01:31:25,020
The animation frames.

2006
01:31:25,380 --> 01:31:27,180
If you want to use any of the animation frames.

2007
01:31:27,680 --> 01:31:28,480
As a wallpaper.

2008
01:31:28,720 --> 01:31:30,060
That would be member locked.

2009
01:31:31,080 --> 01:31:32,020
Exclusive for members.

2010
01:31:32,120 --> 01:31:33,540
Regarding animation frames.

2011
01:31:34,280 --> 01:31:36,420
If you have a particular frame that you want.

2012
01:31:36,520 --> 01:31:38,180
To be made into a wallpaper.

2013
01:31:38,540 --> 01:31:40,440
I will be uploading those frames.

2014
01:31:40,960 --> 01:31:41,780
Animation frames.

2015
01:31:43,740 --> 01:31:44,880
HD quality of that.

2016
01:31:45,200 --> 01:31:46,180
In members.

2017
01:31:46,400 --> 01:31:47,660
But the splash art.

2018
01:31:47,760 --> 01:31:49,080
The ones you saw in the loading screens.

2019
01:31:49,380 --> 01:31:50,820
The ones you saw in the loading screens.

2020
01:31:51,080 --> 01:31:53,900
Like the alt girl doki.

2021
01:31:54,800 --> 01:31:55,620
Like the tomato.

2022
01:31:56,060 --> 01:31:57,000
The holding the tomato.

2023
01:31:57,180 --> 01:31:57,680
All of that.

2024
01:31:57,840 --> 01:31:58,660
That is free.

2025
01:31:58,880 --> 01:31:59,720
Those will be free.

2026
01:32:01,080 --> 01:32:02,200
3D models that you saw.

2027
01:32:02,380 --> 01:32:03,880
Except for the skins.

2028
01:32:04,100 --> 01:32:04,940
The dragoon skins.

2029
01:32:05,260 --> 01:32:06,860
That are based off of my friends.

2030
01:32:07,640 --> 01:32:09,460
Those are not going to be for download.

2031
01:32:10,020 --> 01:32:12,180
Because some of them are like corporate.

2032
01:32:12,420 --> 01:32:13,740
So I don't own them.

2033
01:32:14,780 --> 01:32:16,260
But the regular dragoons.

2034
01:32:17,580 --> 01:32:18,400
Retro doki.

2035
01:32:19,340 --> 01:32:20,520
Retro retro doki.

2036
01:32:21,560 --> 01:32:22,400
The tomato.

2037
01:32:22,640 --> 01:32:25,260
There is actually a tomato model made as well.

2038
01:32:25,500 --> 01:32:26,600
Those 3D models.

2039
01:32:26,720 --> 01:32:28,400
Will all be free to download.

2040
01:32:30,360 --> 01:32:32,620
Those will be free to download.

2041
01:32:33,240 --> 01:32:34,840
Then I will tweet about it later.

2042
01:32:35,800 --> 01:32:36,520
So yes.

2043
01:32:36,700 --> 01:32:38,280
Look at all of these artists we recruited.

2044
01:32:38,440 --> 01:32:40,040
I really wanted to have like.

2045
01:32:40,200 --> 01:32:41,900
An actual game feel.

2046
01:32:42,100 --> 01:32:43,980
Like I spared no expense.

2047
01:32:44,220 --> 01:32:46,040
I wanted to be a game feel.

2048
01:32:46,420 --> 01:32:47,560
So like you see.

They did like additional stuff.

2071
01:33:30,780 --> 01:33:32,700
Because Shio also did the billboard art as well.

2072
01:33:32,960 --> 01:33:34,700
And then Honey I had like requests.

2073
01:33:34,840 --> 01:33:35,700
Like maybe like three days.

2074
01:33:35,720 --> 01:33:37,760
Two days before the stream.

2075
01:33:37,900 --> 01:33:41,520
I'd be like can we have a sticker of doking.

2076
01:33:42,360 --> 01:33:43,540
It would be so good.

2077

2078
01:33:45,460 --> 01:33:46,640
And then they were like I got you.

2079

And they literally drew it in like less than a day.

2080
01:33:49,920 --> 01:33:52,160
And they added the doking sticker.

2081

And then Honey sent me.

2085
01:33:56,760 --> 01:33:58,640
Like a really supportive DM.

2091
01:34:09,800 --> 01:34:13,300
And because of that I asked if they could also make a new sticker.

2092
01:34:13,540 --> 01:34:14,540

2093
01:34:14,920 --> 01:34:17,340

So huge shout out to Honey.

2099
01:34:31,260 --> 01:34:32,840
For like accommodating that.

2100
01:34:33,040 --> 01:34:34,120
Like they could have said no.

2101
01:34:34,400 --> 01:34:35,680
And I would have been like okay.

2102
01:34:36,280 --> 01:34:36,800

2103
01:34:38,200 --> 01:34:39,720
But they were like don't worry.

2104
01:34:40,680 --> 01:34:42,920
Don't worry I can do it.

2105
01:34:43,200 --> 01:34:43,700
Alright.

2106
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:47,140
3D team you're going to recognize a lot of these names.

2107
01:34:47,680 --> 01:34:48,540
I recruited.

2108
01:34:48,760 --> 01:34:50,180
I brought in a 3D team.

2109
01:34:50,180 --> 01:34:51,300
Well I brought in Jules.

2110
01:34:51,440 --> 01:34:52,540
Because I love working with Jules.

2111
01:34:52,760 --> 01:34:53,960
I brought in Legends.

2112
01:34:55,380 --> 01:34:57,260
Oh wait I brought in Jules and Squid.

2113
01:34:57,420 --> 01:34:59,640
I hit up Jules, Squid and Hask.

2114
01:35:00,320 --> 01:35:01,020
And um.

2115
01:35:02,200 --> 01:35:03,820
And I was like alright.

2116
01:35:04,820 --> 01:35:07,220
Bring in any of our old 3D team.

2117
01:35:07,320 --> 01:35:07,660
Into.

2118
01:35:07,780 --> 01:35:08,240
Oh my gosh.

2119
01:35:09,160 --> 01:35:10,580
Alright this is going to be awkward.

2120
01:35:11,180 --> 01:35:11,960
I'll be here.

2121
01:35:13,160 --> 01:35:16,680
I was like bring in any of our old 3D team in.

2122
01:35:17,340 --> 01:35:17,780
Um.

2123
01:35:17,940 --> 01:35:18,800
Um in.

2124
01:35:20,180 --> 01:35:22,120
Whatever you guys think that will work.

2125
01:35:22,320 --> 01:35:24,180
And then they brought in the rest of the people here.

2126
01:35:24,480 --> 01:35:25,820
So we've worked with Hask.

2127
01:35:25,880 --> 01:35:27,100
We've worked with all of these guys.

2128
01:35:27,500 --> 01:35:29,300
The newest addition is.

2129
01:35:29,760 --> 01:35:31,060
Isaac and Violet.

2130
01:35:31,080 --> 01:35:33,400
Violet did the Retro Doki.

2131
01:35:33,820 --> 01:35:36,120
You know like I really wanted it as an inside joke.

2132
01:35:36,220 --> 01:35:37,840
I was like I want Retro Doki in there.

2133
01:35:39,580 --> 01:35:41,640
I want Retro Doki but like.

2134
01:35:41,860 --> 01:35:42,700
Retro Retro.

2135
01:35:43,540 --> 01:35:46,140
Like Playstation 1 polygons.

2136
01:35:46,160 --> 01:35:46,960
And I brought in.

2137
01:35:47,580 --> 01:35:48,360
Low poly.

2138
01:35:48,660 --> 01:35:49,580
I brought in Violet.

2139
01:35:50,180 --> 01:35:50,880
I need this.

2140
01:35:51,040 --> 01:35:52,480
And then yeah Violet made it.

2141
01:35:54,460 --> 01:35:56,320
Isaac was our 3D animator.

2142
01:35:56,520 --> 01:35:57,980
And also I think the one with the most.

2143
01:35:58,000 --> 01:35:58,580
Apex knowledge.

2144
01:35:58,960 --> 01:36:01,680
So Isaac was like don't worry guys.

2145
01:36:03,640 --> 01:36:04,080
Like.

2146
01:36:04,300 --> 01:36:05,400
Like they were like giving.

2147
01:36:05,560 --> 01:36:07,420
Like ideas and input.

2148
01:36:07,560 --> 01:36:10,180
Regarding trying to make it more like Apex slash Overwatch.

2149
01:36:10,540 --> 01:36:11,860
So they helped a lot.

2150
01:36:11,920 --> 01:36:13,060
With like giving like.

2151
01:36:13,860 --> 01:36:14,740
Critiques and stuff.

2152
01:36:14,860 --> 01:36:18,200
And being like okay the GUI should look like this.

2153
01:36:18,420 --> 01:36:19,820
The graphics should look like this.

2154
01:36:20,180 --> 01:36:21,320
Similar to how Apex does it.

2155
01:36:21,400 --> 01:36:22,520
Like all that stuff.

2156
01:36:23,580 --> 01:36:25,160
But Isaac fully animated.

2157
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:27,220
Everything that you saw.

2158
01:36:27,840 --> 01:36:28,400
Regarding.

2159
01:36:29,320 --> 01:36:30,920
Regarding the gameplay footage.

2160
01:36:31,280 --> 01:36:33,180
So like huge shout out to Isaac.

2161
01:36:33,620 --> 01:36:36,160
They were a new person.

2162
01:36:36,220 --> 01:36:37,240
I've never worked with before.

2163
01:36:37,520 --> 01:36:39,720
But I saw their animation and I was like.

2164
01:36:39,860 --> 01:36:41,560
Okay that looks sick.

2165
01:36:42,840 --> 01:36:44,140
This is my vision.

2166
01:36:44,440 --> 01:36:45,940
Do you think you can make it?

2167
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:47,600
By the way Isaac animated this.

2168
01:36:47,600 --> 01:36:48,600
So fast.

2169
01:36:48,840 --> 01:36:52,020
Because like the 3D team finished all the.

2170
01:36:53,140 --> 01:36:53,800
Models.

2171
01:36:53,860 --> 01:36:56,420
For the fake gameplay footage.

2172
01:36:56,780 --> 01:36:58,500
I think on the 10th.

2173
01:36:58,580 --> 01:36:59,040
I believe.

2174
01:36:59,300 --> 01:37:01,280
I think it was the 10th or not.

2175
01:37:01,500 --> 01:37:04,140
The 3D team can fact check for me.

2176
01:37:04,320 --> 01:37:05,880
But they finished the.

2177
01:37:06,640 --> 01:37:07,760
The set.

2178
01:37:07,920 --> 01:37:09,540
The games like setting the.

2179
01:37:09,800 --> 01:37:10,920
Environment and everything.

2180
01:37:11,280 --> 01:37:13,120
On either the 10th or 13th.

2181
01:37:13,220 --> 01:37:13,880
I don't remember.

2182
01:37:13,880 --> 01:37:15,900
And then Isaac just animated.

2183
01:37:15,920 --> 01:37:18,020
All of that within like 10 days.

2184
01:37:18,240 --> 01:37:19,820
Which was fucking crazy.

2185
01:37:20,040 --> 01:37:21,920
That they were able to do that.

2186
01:37:22,340 --> 01:37:23,480
Um anyway.

2187
01:37:23,800 --> 01:37:24,400
So yes.

2188
01:37:24,560 --> 01:37:27,320
Jewels, Legends, Isaac, Violet, Hask.

2189
01:37:27,940 --> 01:37:30,240
Cart, Squid and Stilted Fish.

2190
01:37:30,600 --> 01:37:32,260
Huge shout out to the 3D team.

2191
01:37:32,600 --> 01:37:33,500
For those who are wondering.

2192
01:37:33,660 --> 01:37:34,520
Is that it?

2193
01:37:34,620 --> 01:37:36,200
What are you going to do with 3D world?

2194
01:37:36,600 --> 01:37:39,700
This world will be turned into a VR chat world.

2195
01:37:39,780 --> 01:37:40,580
In the future.

2196
01:37:40,620 --> 01:37:41,900
I was actually in talks.

2197
01:37:43,880 --> 01:37:45,680
With one of the VR chat.

2198
01:37:46,560 --> 01:37:46,980
Staff.

2199
01:37:48,560 --> 01:37:49,400
Um and.

2200
01:37:51,240 --> 01:37:52,360
It's not going to be instant.

2201
01:37:53,580 --> 01:37:54,600
Literally I was like.

2202
01:37:54,680 --> 01:37:55,960
Alright after all of this is done.

2203
01:37:56,100 --> 01:37:56,640
Our next.

2204
01:37:57,080 --> 01:37:59,040
When you guys relax a little bit.

2205
01:37:59,240 --> 01:38:00,720
There's no deadline for this one.

2206
01:38:00,960 --> 01:38:02,480
But like we will turn.

2207
01:38:03,100 --> 01:38:03,800
Dadwood Canyon.

2208
01:38:04,020 --> 01:38:04,320
By the way.

2209
01:38:05,060 --> 01:38:06,380
They gave me name suggestions.

2210
01:38:07,020 --> 01:38:09,120
I think one was like Dad Canyon or something.

2211
01:38:09,380 --> 01:38:10,660
And then the other one was like.

2212
01:38:13,880 --> 01:38:15,840
I was researching Wild West.

2213
01:38:16,100 --> 01:38:16,960
I was like alright what.

2214
01:38:17,420 --> 01:38:20,080
What do we have in the Wild Wild West.

2215
01:38:20,340 --> 01:38:20,820
And then it's like.

2216
01:38:20,900 --> 01:38:22,660
10 of the most famous.

2217
01:38:24,220 --> 01:38:26,220
Famous places in America.

2218
01:38:26,640 --> 01:38:28,420
Related to the Wild Wild West.

2219
01:38:28,640 --> 01:38:29,500
And then I was like.

2220
01:38:29,620 --> 01:38:30,760
It was like what Deadwood.

2221
01:38:30,840 --> 01:38:32,820
It was like Deadwood City or something.

2222
01:38:33,040 --> 01:38:33,320
And I was like.

2223
01:38:33,900 --> 01:38:34,800
Dadwood Canyon.

2224
01:38:42,040 --> 01:38:43,180
I was like.

2225
01:38:43,400 --> 01:38:43,860
Dadwood Canyon.

2226
01:38:44,640 --> 01:38:45,720
I'm going to put wood.

2227
01:38:48,480 --> 01:38:49,560
That's like a reference.

2228
01:38:49,620 --> 01:38:50,460
To famous.

2229
01:38:51,260 --> 01:38:51,660
Famous.

2230
01:38:51,800 --> 01:38:52,660
Western city.

2231
01:38:57,300 --> 01:38:58,100
It works.

2232
01:38:58,160 --> 01:38:58,420
It works.

2233
01:38:58,520 --> 01:38:58,840
Also.

2234
01:38:59,180 --> 01:39:00,840
Remember Goons would be like.

2235
01:39:00,960 --> 01:39:04,000
So that's why she was asking us for game names.

2236
01:39:04,380 --> 01:39:05,080
Alright so.

2237
01:39:05,340 --> 01:39:06,220
A while ago.

2238
01:39:06,420 --> 01:39:07,320
I think like two months ago.

2239
01:39:07,520 --> 01:39:08,420
Or a month and a half ago.

2240
01:39:08,420 --> 01:39:09,880
I was like hey guys.

2241
01:39:10,240 --> 01:39:12,040
Give me a game name.

2242
01:39:12,380 --> 01:39:15,060
Because I need help.

2243
01:39:15,440 --> 01:39:17,160
This is going to be a wallpaper.

2244
01:39:17,600 --> 01:39:18,200
Theme.

2245
01:39:18,600 --> 01:39:19,140
For.

2246
01:39:19,700 --> 01:39:21,380
This is going to be a wallpaper theme.

2247
01:39:21,480 --> 01:39:22,960
For like a future month.

2248
01:39:23,240 --> 01:39:24,460
And I was thinking up.

2249
01:39:24,580 --> 01:39:27,840
I wanted to figure out a fake game name.

2250
01:39:28,160 --> 01:39:29,700
And then I fooled you all.

2251
01:39:29,900 --> 01:39:31,620
It was actually for this.

2252
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,400
That's where I stole BattleBots.

2253
01:39:38,420 --> 01:39:39,680
From a member.

2254
01:39:40,980 --> 01:39:41,780
I was like.

2255
01:39:41,880 --> 01:39:43,360
Great name.

2256
01:39:43,920 --> 01:39:45,180
And I was like hey guys.

2257
01:39:46,760 --> 01:39:48,400
Look at this cool name.

2258
01:39:48,840 --> 01:39:50,380
I like came up with.

2259
01:39:50,420 --> 01:39:51,180
My self project.

2260
01:39:59,740 --> 01:40:01,780
I was actually waiting for the wall.

2261
01:40:01,860 --> 01:40:03,700
We have five wallpapers.

2262
01:40:03,720 --> 01:40:04,140
I don't even know.

2263
01:40:04,200 --> 01:40:07,320
We have like five to six free wallpapers.

2264
01:40:08,420 --> 01:40:08,980
One wallpaper.

2265
01:40:09,300 --> 01:40:12,160
You get five to six free wallpapers.

2266
01:40:12,460 --> 01:40:12,900
Now.

2267
01:40:13,480 --> 01:40:13,920
Anyway.

2268
01:40:16,680 --> 01:40:17,120
Anyway.

2269
01:40:19,160 --> 01:40:19,980
Like I said.

2270
01:40:20,120 --> 01:40:21,640
This world that we.

2271
01:40:21,860 --> 01:40:22,840
This team.

2272
01:40:22,880 --> 01:40:23,400
I'm a producer.

2273
01:40:23,600 --> 01:40:24,700
So I just chucked money at it.

2274
01:40:24,720 --> 01:40:25,400
But I did give feedback.

2275
01:40:28,480 --> 01:40:29,360
This game.

2276
01:40:30,360 --> 01:40:31,060
This world.

2277
01:40:31,160 --> 01:40:31,780
This 3D world.

2278
01:40:31,780 --> 01:40:33,520
That we made for a fake game.

2279
01:40:33,860 --> 01:40:36,220
Will be made into a VRChat world.

2280
01:40:36,320 --> 01:40:37,040
In the future.

2281
01:40:39,040 --> 01:40:39,900
Like I said.

2282
01:40:40,220 --> 01:40:42,580
It's not going to be something that's done really fast.

2283
01:40:42,740 --> 01:40:44,160
Because converting into a VRChat world.

2284
01:40:44,280 --> 01:40:45,440
Is a lot different.

2285
01:40:45,960 --> 01:40:46,400
Than.

2286
01:40:48,280 --> 01:40:50,740
It was not intentionally made to be a world.

2287
01:40:52,320 --> 01:40:53,220
But I figured.

2288
01:40:53,400 --> 01:40:54,600
Because I was talking to a staff member.

2289
01:40:54,760 --> 01:40:55,320
At VRChat.

2290
01:40:55,420 --> 01:40:56,640
Because they reached out to me.

2291
01:40:56,760 --> 01:40:57,160
And was like.

2292
01:40:57,160 --> 01:40:59,180
Hey do you ever want to do anything with VRChat in the future?

2293
01:40:59,340 --> 01:40:59,900
Let us know.

2294
01:41:00,140 --> 01:41:00,480
And I was like.

2295
01:41:00,540 --> 01:41:01,340
I really want to open a world.

2296
01:41:01,500 --> 01:41:02,100
Is it for free?

2297
01:41:02,180 --> 01:41:02,460
And they were like.

2298
01:41:02,520 --> 01:41:02,660
Yeah.

2299
01:41:02,720 --> 01:41:03,260
It's for free.

2300
01:41:03,400 --> 01:41:03,700
And I was like.

2301
01:41:03,760 --> 01:41:03,940
Woo!

2302
01:41:05,020 --> 01:41:06,920
I love it when it's for free.

2303
01:41:07,140 --> 01:41:08,800
I can open the world for free.

2304
01:41:08,880 --> 01:41:09,360
And I was like.

2305
01:41:09,400 --> 01:41:10,220
Can I have it up forever?

2306
01:41:10,360 --> 01:41:10,620
Yeah.

2307
01:41:10,780 --> 01:41:11,260
You can.

2308
01:41:11,400 --> 01:41:11,880
For free?

2309
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:12,320
Yeah.

2310
01:41:12,480 --> 01:41:12,800
Woo!

2311
01:41:16,180 --> 01:41:17,920
So whenever this world.

2312
01:41:20,480 --> 01:41:21,460
Whenever this world.

2313
01:41:22,240 --> 01:41:22,880
Is done.

2314
01:41:23,080 --> 01:41:24,460
It will be there forever.

2315
01:41:28,600 --> 01:41:29,120
Alright.

2316
01:41:29,560 --> 01:41:30,280
What else?

2317
01:41:30,380 --> 01:41:30,640
What else?

2318
01:41:30,720 --> 01:41:30,960
What else?

2319
01:41:31,080 --> 01:41:32,400
I have 16 slides.

2320
01:41:32,700 --> 01:41:33,380
Oh my god.

2321
01:41:33,440 --> 01:41:34,220
This is slide 7.

2322
01:41:34,420 --> 01:41:36,600
The animation motion team.

2323
01:41:36,980 --> 01:41:37,500
Alright.

2324
01:41:37,580 --> 01:41:38,320
First off.

2325
01:41:38,360 --> 01:41:39,980
We have to applaud.

2326
01:41:41,520 --> 01:41:42,040
Bullied.

2327
01:41:43,320 --> 01:41:43,840
Bullied.

2328
01:41:44,500 --> 01:41:45,440
I'm so sorry.

2329
01:41:45,620 --> 01:41:46,920
We need to applaud you.

2330
01:41:47,080 --> 01:41:48,300
But I'm butchering your name.

2331
01:41:48,440 --> 01:41:50,200
They were the main editor.

2332
01:41:50,300 --> 01:41:51,440
For the video.

2333
01:41:51,480 --> 01:41:53,200
To put everything together.

2334
01:41:53,720 --> 01:41:55,920
And the one where I had notes for them.

2335
01:41:55,960 --> 01:41:56,900
Regarding sound design.

2336
01:41:57,160 --> 01:41:57,900
And I was like.

2337
01:41:58,160 --> 01:41:59,620
Fix sound design.

2338
01:42:03,720 --> 01:42:06,500
They put all the videos together.

2339
01:42:06,580 --> 01:42:07,260
They had.

2340
01:42:07,420 --> 01:42:08,320
They pulled off.

2341
01:42:08,540 --> 01:42:10,980
2 to 3 all nighters.

2342
01:42:10,980 --> 01:42:12,040
To put all of.

2343
01:42:12,160 --> 01:42:14,140

Also you guys can see this poster.

01:42:18,880 --> 01:42:19,640
I'm sorry.

2348
01:42:19,800 --> 01:42:21,060
I don't have ADHD.

2349
01:42:21,480 --> 01:42:23,240
I just need you guys to look at this poster.

2350
01:42:23,460 --> 01:42:23,820

I feel like.

2357
01:42:33,340 --> 01:42:35,400
Bullied really does deserve a lot of love.

2358
01:42:35,440 --> 01:42:35,780
And attention.

2359
01:42:36,020 --> 01:42:36,440

During the prod.

2363
01:42:42,040 --> 01:42:42,560
Like yesterday.

2364
01:42:43,220 --> 01:42:44,520

We really need to give a huge applause.

01:42:55,240 --> 01:42:56,180
And uh.

2371
01:42:56,800 --> 01:42:58,380
Love to the video editor.

2372
01:42:58,580 --> 01:43:00,040
To the main editor.

2373
01:43:00,180 --> 01:43:01,080
That put all of this together.

2374
01:43:01,520 --> 01:43:01,900
Um.

2375
01:43:02,200 --> 01:43:02,740
Cause like.

2376
01:43:02,880 --> 01:43:04,080
I wasn't in the server.

2377
01:43:04,420 --> 01:43:05,520
I'm not in the server.

2378
01:43:05,840 --> 01:43:07,700
I'll join back the server later.

2379
01:43:07,900 --> 01:43:08,540
When I'm like.

2380
01:43:08,880 --> 01:43:09,560
I was like.

2381
01:43:09,600 --> 01:43:10,500
Okay I'm gonna join back the server later.

2382
01:43:10,620 --> 01:43:11,700
So my staff was helping me.

2383
01:43:11,740 --> 01:43:12,540
Coronate and stuff.

2384
01:43:12,960 --> 01:43:13,400
Um.

2385
01:43:13,940 --> 01:43:15,040

01:43:15,040 --> 01:43:16,840
My staff was like.

01:43:16,920 --> 01:43:18,060
Giving me updates on everything.

2388
01:43:18,420 --> 01:43:19,320
While I was preparing.

2389
01:43:20,580 --> 01:43:22,380
Just like preparing for the stream in general.

2390
01:43:22,740 --> 01:43:24,840
And they were giving me updates regarding soundicide.

2391
01:43:24,940 --> 01:43:27,120
So I was giving my staff member the notes.

2392
01:43:27,280 --> 01:43:27,840

Oh no I don't want to like.

01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:57,060
And also I want to say huge shoutout to Raggy.

2405
01:43:58,020 --> 01:44:03,760
I saw their amazing animation on Twitter.

2406
01:44:03,840 --> 01:44:08,220
And I was like, I need you to make the animation.

2407
01:44:08,220 --> 01:44:14,100
Like, I think... because I was like, she is a one-man team.

2408
01:44:14,660 --> 01:44:16,160
It was crazy.

2409
01:44:16,320 --> 01:44:19,020
Because I saw her animations on Twitter.

2410
01:44:19,300 --> 01:44:25,700
And I was really impressed because the animation she posted, she did all of it herself.

2411
01:44:26,100 --> 01:44:27,300
Like, by herself.

2412
01:44:27,540 --> 01:44:31,740
And I was like, I think she was the first person I ever recruited onto the team.

2413
01:44:31,900 --> 01:44:38,200
I was like, if I'm getting anybody, I really want Raggy to be on my team for this.

2414
01:44:38,220 --> 01:44:39,700
To do all of this.

2415
01:44:39,800 --> 01:44:42,160
I know they are also preparing for their own VTuber debut.

2416
01:44:42,340 --> 01:44:43,200
So please check her out.

2417
01:44:43,520 --> 01:44:45,800
At first she wanted to do the tomato one too.

2418
01:44:46,480 --> 01:44:48,920
She was like... she drew the storyboard for everything.

2419
01:44:49,200 --> 01:44:50,720
She drew the storyboard for the entire animation.

2420
01:44:51,240 --> 01:44:53,800
And then at first she was like, I think I can do the background.

2421
01:44:54,020 --> 01:44:56,060
And then the whole team was like, no, no don't.

2422
01:44:56,080 --> 01:44:59,580
You're gonna fucking kill yourself with the... by exhaustion.

2423
01:44:59,880 --> 01:45:00,700
You're gonna fucking...

2424
01:45:02,460 --> 01:45:03,080
Exhaust yourself.

2425
01:45:03,520 --> 01:45:03,920
No.

2426
01:45:04,020 --> 01:45:07,120
And then at first she was gonna be like, oh I'm gonna do the tomato.

2427
01:45:07,220 --> 01:45:07,940
And I was like, no.

2428
01:45:08,220 --> 01:45:10,340
I'm gonna recruit Saide for the tomato.

2429
01:45:10,480 --> 01:45:11,640
I was just like...

2430
01:45:11,640 --> 01:45:12,680
I was just like...

2431
01:45:12,680 --> 01:45:13,140
No.

2432
01:45:13,340 --> 01:45:15,100
I was like, Raggy, no.

2433
01:45:15,220 --> 01:45:17,040
I brought in another animator.

2434
01:45:17,120 --> 01:45:18,120
I think...

2435
01:45:18,120 --> 01:45:18,420
No.

2436
01:45:24,200 --> 01:45:25,240
Oh my god.

2437
01:45:25,420 --> 01:45:26,540
And I...

2438
01:45:26,540 --> 01:45:30,200
When we saw the storyboard, I was like, Raggy, I saw the storyboard.

2439
01:45:30,360 --> 01:45:31,760
I'm bringing Saide.

2440
01:45:32,680 --> 01:45:35,660
Saide has worked on my animated shorts.

2441
01:45:36,060 --> 01:45:37,060
Most recognizable.

2442
01:45:37,300 --> 01:45:38,800
The Resident Evil short.

2443
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:39,880
Doki Bites.

2444
01:45:39,880 --> 01:45:41,420
That she did.

2445
01:45:41,620 --> 01:45:48,140
And I brought her in to help Raggy with doing the tomato fakeout trailer.

2446
01:45:51,960 --> 01:45:54,640
And Mortis brought in Will to help out with background.

2447
01:45:54,700 --> 01:45:56,500
To draw the backgrounds of the animation.

2448
01:45:57,340 --> 01:45:59,320
Yes, Raggy did...

2449
01:45:59,320 --> 01:45:59,800
I don't know.

2450
01:45:59,840 --> 01:46:05,040
You can read her Twitter and realize a lot of her I'm so tired was about the swatch.

2451
01:46:06,740 --> 01:46:07,320
I'm so tired.

2452
01:46:07,320 --> 01:46:07,900
I'm so tired.

2453
01:46:07,920 --> 01:46:09,100
I'm so tired.

2454
01:46:09,100 --> 01:46:14,580
If you read back her Twitter, it's like, I'm so tired.

2455
01:46:18,020 --> 01:46:22,220
It was about the swatch.

2456
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:33,280
I'm glad we brought in more people.

2457
01:46:35,880 --> 01:46:37,960
To help out.

2458
01:46:37,960 --> 01:46:39,940
Because it was so much.

2459
01:46:40,400 --> 01:46:44,660
It was a lot of work.

2460
01:46:46,100 --> 01:46:47,640
Oh my god.

2461
01:46:48,120 --> 01:46:51,020
Because I was super open to bring more people in.

2462
01:46:51,140 --> 01:46:52,400
I was like, guys, are you sure we don't...

2463
01:46:52,400 --> 01:46:55,020
I was like, okay, bring in as many people as you guys want.

2464
01:46:55,140 --> 01:46:56,540
Guys, bring in as...

2465
01:46:56,540 --> 01:46:58,220
I'll hire more.

2466
01:46:58,940 --> 01:47:00,400
I'll throw more money.

2467
01:47:00,460 --> 01:47:02,580
Hire more people if you need to.

2468
01:47:02,840 --> 01:47:03,980
Oh my god.

2469
01:47:07,380 --> 01:47:07,940
I'm so tired.

2470
01:47:09,560 --> 01:47:10,040
Wow.

2471
01:47:12,040 --> 01:47:13,680
This is going to take forever.

2472
01:47:22,700 --> 01:47:25,160
So I feel really low.

2473
01:47:25,160 --> 01:47:25,620
I tried Sand Heyman.

2474
01:47:25,700 --> 01:47:26,320
But seems we can't get near him because we're on the ground.

2475
01:47:26,320 --> 01:47:27,260
You can't drive the more.

2476
01:47:28,900 --> 01:47:30,500
We have been nothing to ourselves, but I feel even better.

2477
01:47:30,600 --> 01:47:30,720
It's just being.

2478
01:47:30,800 --> 01:47:31,280
I love model.

2479
01:47:31,900 --> 01:47:32,220
It's like we are living in another dimension.

2480
01:47:32,280 --> 01:47:35,000
I thought we were living in another dimension.

2481
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:35,020
Why don't you come out?

2482
01:47:35,020 --> 01:47:36,560
The pé?енно.

2483
01:47:36,560 --> 01:47:36,560
trakaaos.

2484
01:47:36,620 --> 01:47:37,100
No!

2485
01:47:37,100 --> 01:47:46,580
And the still images of them, for those who don't use the Steam application to make animated wallpapers and stuff.

2486
01:47:50,520 --> 01:47:55,400
But yes, Momo was actually brought in last minute too, because one of our animators was like, we need more people to help out.

2487
01:47:58,700 --> 01:47:59,100
Yes.

2488
01:47:59,720 --> 01:48:01,180
Huge shoutout to this team.

2489
01:48:01,540 --> 01:48:01,940
Alright.

2490
01:48:02,120 --> 01:48:04,600
Sorry, there's a lot of... I have... There's a lot of creators.

2491
01:48:04,720 --> 01:48:04,880
Okay.

2492
01:48:04,880 --> 01:48:05,200
Alright!

2493
01:48:05,900 --> 01:48:06,380
Clea!

2494
01:48:07,140 --> 01:48:09,480
And... Woah, Clea did not draw both of them, by the way.

2495
01:48:09,520 --> 01:48:10,260
I've been blocking.

2496
01:48:10,660 --> 01:48:13,820
Trident did these wallpapers.

2497
01:48:14,980 --> 01:48:17,920
They just will be released, like I said, for free.

2498
01:48:18,300 --> 01:48:19,840
They did these wallpapers.

2499
01:48:20,280 --> 01:48:21,340
The splash art.

2500
01:48:23,280 --> 01:48:25,680
Cho did this one.

2501
01:48:25,800 --> 01:48:29,800
And Tai did the background artist for this.

2502
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:31,560
Tai also did a lot of stuff.

2503
01:48:31,600 --> 01:48:34,060
We're writing sketches and helping with storyboards.

2504
01:48:34,200 --> 01:48:34,860
And everything.

2505
01:48:34,880 --> 01:48:40,800
I want you guys to know, the 3D team came up with the map design.

2506
01:48:41,020 --> 01:48:42,960
First, the environment design of the 3D world.

2507
01:48:43,160 --> 01:48:45,200
And then, like, you know, it was built off of that.

2508
01:48:45,280 --> 01:48:47,440
And then they just added more and more stuff to it.

2509
01:48:47,620 --> 01:48:48,660
And... Yeah.

2510
01:48:48,740 --> 01:48:52,840
And then we just... We had Tai draw the visual art of it as well.

2511
01:48:52,960 --> 01:48:55,000
Just to be like...

2512
01:48:55,960 --> 01:48:56,760
Just to...

2513
01:48:57,660 --> 01:49:01,260
Make it more, I guess, immersive when it comes to fake game.

2514
01:49:01,420 --> 01:49:04,280
Because there's always like the map art in the fake game portion.

2515
01:49:04,280 --> 01:49:05,620
In the gaming portion.

2516
01:49:06,220 --> 01:49:08,120
Like what the map looks like and stuff.

2517
01:49:13,220 --> 01:49:13,700
Yeah.

2518
01:49:14,200 --> 01:49:15,500
And... By the way...

2519
01:49:15,500 --> 01:49:18,800
Okay, I'm gonna talk about it more when we're...

2520
01:49:18,800 --> 01:49:20,440
Alright, so... And then this one was...

2521
01:49:20,440 --> 01:49:23,860
By the way, there was like... In the behind the scenes portion...

2522
01:49:24,760 --> 01:49:30,440
I will be... In the behind the scenes portion, I will talk more about the sketches.

2523
01:49:30,780 --> 01:49:32,660
Because there was a lot of concepts and stuff.

2524
01:49:32,900 --> 01:49:35,720
There were a shitload of concepts and everything.

2525
01:49:35,720 --> 01:49:40,980
Coming into designing the splash art.

2526
01:49:41,160 --> 01:49:49,580
So in the behind the scenes stream on Tuesday, I will go into more detail about all the concept art and everything behind the scenes.

2527
01:49:50,080 --> 01:49:55,280
Regarding building up this fake game that was made from this project team.

2528
01:50:00,940 --> 01:50:01,960
Okay, so yeah.

2529
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:04,220
Porusun and Yuko did these maps.

2530
01:50:04,460 --> 01:50:05,700
Chiyo did all of them.

2531
01:50:05,720 --> 01:50:06,840
And they did all these billboards.

2532
01:50:07,530 --> 01:50:11,440
Did the billboard art to fill the 3D world.

2533
01:50:12,020 --> 01:50:15,840
So I love... I think DadSubs was my favorite.

2534
01:50:20,820 --> 01:50:22,540
Dad, was this your favorite too?

2535
01:50:25,400 --> 01:50:27,500
Was this also your favorite?

2536
01:50:27,560 --> 01:50:28,200
Yeah?

2537
01:50:32,680 --> 01:50:34,120
I don't know.

2538
01:50:34,180 --> 01:50:35,700
I think DadSubs was pretty funny.

2539
01:50:39,420 --> 01:50:40,460
And then...

2540
01:50:40,460 --> 01:50:42,480
That sprays!

2541
01:50:43,100 --> 01:50:43,620
Alright.

2542
01:50:44,440 --> 01:50:46,060
Yeah, we're gonna have to move over here.

2543
01:50:46,340 --> 01:50:48,900
So here are the item shop artists.

2544
01:50:48,920 --> 01:50:51,700
Honey, who did all the item shop...

2545
01:50:51,700 --> 01:50:51,980
Whoa.

2546
01:50:53,120 --> 01:50:54,040
Sorry, the alert.

2547
01:50:54,200 --> 01:50:55,600
All the item shop and stuff.

2548
01:50:55,660 --> 01:50:57,180
So, oh my god, I love it all.

2549
01:50:57,380 --> 01:50:58,400
I love all of them.

2550
01:50:58,420 --> 01:51:01,040
I think my favorite has to be...

2551
01:51:01,040 --> 01:51:03,820
I think my favorite has to be the...

2552
01:51:03,820 --> 01:51:04,260
Okay.

2553
01:51:04,820 --> 01:51:08,080
I think that one has to be my favorite.

2554
01:51:08,420 --> 01:51:11,220
By the way, a lot of the art...

2555
01:51:11,220 --> 01:51:14,460
We're in discussion with the artist.

2556
01:51:14,820 --> 01:51:18,920
But a lot... some of the artwork is gonna be made into future merch.

2557
01:51:19,100 --> 01:51:22,920
That will be released for pre-order on my birthday.

2558
01:51:23,280 --> 01:51:25,560
So like this, the sprays and...

2559
01:51:25,560 --> 01:51:28,000
I'm deciding stickers might be used as...

2560
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:29,360
You know, be sold as actual stickers.

2561
01:51:29,700 --> 01:51:33,260
And the sprays might be sold as charms in the future.

2562
01:51:33,260 --> 01:51:33,880
Or stickers.

2563
01:51:34,060 --> 01:51:35,460
We're not... we're still discussing right now.

2564
01:51:35,600 --> 01:51:36,920
I'd love to have your ideas.

2565
01:51:37,140 --> 01:51:38,300
Because I'm doing this...

2566
01:51:38,300 --> 01:51:39,320
The next... the merch release.

2567
01:51:39,420 --> 01:51:40,380
The next merch drop.

2568
01:51:40,500 --> 01:51:42,380
To be like BattleBirds themed.

2569
01:51:42,600 --> 01:51:43,400
As if like you're...

2570
01:51:43,400 --> 01:51:45,440
As if you know we go to Apex Legends store.

2571
01:51:45,620 --> 01:51:46,240
Merch store.

2572
01:51:46,480 --> 01:51:49,040
And you buy like merch from the Apex Legends store.

2573
01:51:49,140 --> 01:51:50,140
Or like Blizzard shop.

2574
01:51:50,420 --> 01:51:52,840
And you see like these merch that they only make.

2575
01:51:52,940 --> 01:51:53,460
And stuff.

2576
01:51:53,640 --> 01:51:54,880
So we're gonna have...

2577
01:51:54,880 --> 01:51:55,880
One of them is like...

2578
01:51:55,880 --> 01:51:56,900
We're gonna have like...

2579
01:51:56,900 --> 01:51:58,560
T-shirt with the BattleBirds logo.

2580
01:51:59,320 --> 01:52:01,380
That's like one of the things I really wanna do.

2581
01:52:01,520 --> 01:52:02,940
Because I want you guys to pretend...

2582
01:52:02,940 --> 01:52:04,860
That BattleBirds is a real game.

2583
01:52:11,120 --> 01:52:13,920
So I love your feedback and your input.

2584
01:52:14,520 --> 01:52:16,720
Like in the next couple of days.

2585
01:52:16,760 --> 01:52:19,280
Regarding what kind of merch you wanna see BattleBirds have.

2586
01:52:20,460 --> 01:52:23,000
It's real to me Doki!

2587
01:52:23,480 --> 01:52:25,160
It's real to me!

2588
01:52:29,700 --> 01:52:30,980
But yes.

2589
01:52:30,980 --> 01:52:32,620
Like we're planning on making...

2590
01:52:33,540 --> 01:52:36,220
The wallpapers as like postcards maybe.

2591
01:52:36,380 --> 01:52:39,140
Or maybe a wall scroll tapestry.

2592
01:52:39,400 --> 01:52:40,340
We're still deciding.

2593
01:52:40,880 --> 01:52:43,700
Me and my staff team are still deciding what to be made of merch.

2594
01:52:43,700 --> 01:52:45,040
But I would love to have your input as well.

2595
01:52:45,400 --> 01:52:46,620
What you guys wanna buy.

2596
01:52:46,820 --> 01:52:48,040
We're gonna make the character art.

2597
01:52:48,240 --> 01:52:50,480
I don't know if you guys saw like the character art selection from Xie.

2598
01:52:50,760 --> 01:52:52,620
It's gonna be a giant diorama.

2599
01:52:53,020 --> 01:52:55,520
The giant diorama...

2600
01:52:57,080 --> 01:52:57,860
Acrylic stand.

2601
01:52:58,140 --> 01:52:59,560
With all the four...

2602
01:52:59,560 --> 01:53:00,680
With all the three?

2603
01:53:00,680 --> 01:53:01,380
I think three...

2604
01:53:01,380 --> 01:53:03,020
All the three characters select art.

2605
01:53:03,120 --> 01:53:03,560
And everything.

2606
01:53:03,680 --> 01:53:05,740
That's the one that I'm definitely sure that's gonna be...

2607
01:53:06,440 --> 01:53:08,280
That's gonna be made into merch.

2608
01:53:08,780 --> 01:53:12,700
And then here are the item shop of some of my friends.

2609
01:53:12,800 --> 01:53:14,120
The people I've collabed with.

2610
01:53:15,900 --> 01:53:17,640
So you might recognize some of them.

2611
01:53:18,040 --> 01:53:18,520
Also...

2612
01:53:18,520 --> 01:53:19,340
Yes.

2613
01:53:19,380 --> 01:53:21,800
I asked a few of them to do voice lines.

2614
01:53:23,160 --> 01:53:23,640
Okay.

2615
01:53:24,320 --> 01:53:29,060
I need to tell you the story of the voice line I had with Saachi.

2616
01:53:29,300 --> 01:53:30,460
So we were playing...

2617
01:53:30,460 --> 01:53:31,480
Overwatch 2 together.

2618
01:53:31,800 --> 01:53:33,460
I was like, yo, are you still down?

2619
01:53:33,720 --> 01:53:34,860
Because like I asked her.

2620
01:53:34,920 --> 01:53:35,220
I was like...

2621
01:53:35,220 --> 01:53:36,540
I was like asking Saachi.

2622
01:53:36,660 --> 01:53:37,060
I was like...

2623
01:53:37,060 --> 01:53:39,740
So Saachi, I was like, hey, so like I'm doing this reveal.

2624
01:53:40,520 --> 01:53:43,380
Fuck, I don't know where to put myself in because it covers everybody.

2625
01:53:44,800 --> 01:53:46,780
I'll just be off the screen so you guys can see everything.

2626
01:53:52,340 --> 01:53:52,660
So...

2627
01:53:54,420 --> 01:53:56,060
I won't be selling merch of...

2628
01:53:56,060 --> 01:53:59,600
I won't be selling merch of my friends, by the way.

2629
01:53:59,600 --> 01:54:01,360
Because obviously like they...

2630
01:54:01,360 --> 01:54:02,640
They own their design.

2631
01:54:02,660 --> 01:54:04,640
I'm not gonna like make money off of them.

2632
01:54:05,920 --> 01:54:07,800
The stickers and stuff will be...

2633
01:54:07,800 --> 01:54:12,060
Will only be of like me and things I own.

2634
01:54:12,520 --> 01:54:12,960
Like...

2635
01:54:14,240 --> 01:54:14,680
Anyway.

2636
01:54:14,840 --> 01:54:16,060
So this is a funny story.

2637
01:54:16,420 --> 01:54:18,620
But when I was...

2638
01:54:18,620 --> 01:54:20,580
Like we were playing Overwatch 2 together.

2639
01:54:20,960 --> 01:54:23,560
And so I was like asking like, oh, do you still want to be part of...

2640
01:54:23,560 --> 01:54:26,580
Like I'm doing reveal on Saturday slash Sunday.

2641
01:54:26,740 --> 01:54:27,820
Like do you still want to...

2642
01:54:27,820 --> 01:54:28,820
And she's like, yeah, sure.

2643
01:54:28,820 --> 01:54:30,540
I was like, oh, I just need a voice line.

2644
01:54:30,600 --> 01:54:32,140
She's like, wait, what kind of voice line?

2645
01:54:32,200 --> 01:54:33,740
And then we were like playing Overwatch 2.

2646
01:54:34,080 --> 01:54:36,320
So she was like, what if...

2647
01:54:36,320 --> 01:54:37,100
I'm just gonna...

2648
01:54:37,100 --> 01:54:38,520
I'm just gonna like...

2649
01:54:39,280 --> 01:54:40,420
That is so funny.

2650
01:54:40,620 --> 01:54:45,220
She was like, can I just like steal an Overwatch voice line?

2651
01:54:46,800 --> 01:54:50,540
She was like, what if I just steal an Overwatch voice line?

2652
01:54:50,960 --> 01:54:52,900
And I was like, Merry Christmas.

2653
01:54:54,680 --> 01:54:55,480
From Kenji.

2654
01:54:55,680 --> 01:54:56,800
And I was just like...

2655
01:54:56,800 --> 01:54:58,800
I was like, do whatever you want.

2656
01:54:58,820 --> 01:55:00,320
I was like, no, that'll be so fun.

2657
01:55:00,480 --> 01:55:05,120
And then we were thinking about like, okay, maybe we shouldn't steal a voice line from Overwatch.

2658
01:55:08,020 --> 01:55:10,660
Because we were like looking at Lucio and Genji.

2659
01:55:10,740 --> 01:55:12,260
It was like, oh, I need healing.

2660
01:55:12,460 --> 01:55:13,880
And then we're like, Lucio, oh.

2661
01:55:14,260 --> 01:55:22,280
And then we almost had a voice line of her doing Doomfist's...

2662
01:55:23,140 --> 01:55:23,540
Doomfist's...

2663
01:55:24,440 --> 01:55:25,420
Which one was it?

2664
01:55:25,740 --> 01:55:26,540
Chivalry is dead.

2665
01:55:28,820 --> 01:55:31,060
And then later on, she was like, okay, maybe we shouldn't.

2666
01:55:31,080 --> 01:55:34,280
And if you listen back to it, she would...

2667
01:55:35,020 --> 01:55:36,460
She just was like, hello.

2668
01:55:36,680 --> 01:55:37,240
And she was like...

2669
01:55:39,400 --> 01:55:40,500
I was like...

2670
01:55:40,500 --> 01:55:42,880
I told her, I was like, I'm gonna keep that in.

2671
01:55:43,240 --> 01:55:46,380
I'm gonna keep the cough in.

2672
01:55:50,860 --> 01:55:51,300
Yeah.

2673
01:55:53,840 --> 01:55:54,660
Anyway, yes.

2674
01:55:54,840 --> 01:55:55,900
Look at all these stickers.

2675
01:55:56,180 --> 01:55:57,080
I don't know where to...

2676
01:55:57,080 --> 01:55:57,960
I'm gonna put...

2677
01:55:57,960 --> 01:55:58,740
Here we go.

2678
01:55:59,300 --> 01:56:01,500
I was like, I don't know where to put it.

2679
01:56:01,560 --> 01:56:02,380
Put it myself.

2680
01:56:02,600 --> 01:56:03,520
There's so many.

2681
01:56:06,760 --> 01:56:07,900
And so, yeah.

2682
01:56:08,040 --> 01:56:09,460
So, the ones...

2683
01:56:09,460 --> 01:56:10,940
DoughKing, I would definitely sell that.

2684
01:56:11,300 --> 01:56:13,000
They don't own a tiger.

2685
01:56:14,860 --> 01:56:16,660
They can't own jaguars.

2686
01:56:16,820 --> 01:56:18,840
This is legally distinct jaguar.

2687
01:56:18,920 --> 01:56:20,560
Anyway, DoughKing is gonna...

2688
01:56:20,560 --> 01:56:22,060
I won't sell Jack Jesus though.

2689
01:56:22,100 --> 01:56:23,860
Jack Jesus, I think, might be like...

2690
01:56:23,860 --> 01:56:26,080
Might be a bit of an iffy territory.

2691
01:56:27,100 --> 01:56:28,340
But I will...

2692
01:56:28,340 --> 01:56:29,780
I will sell the DoughKing sticker.

2693
01:56:30,840 --> 01:56:31,600
But yes.

2694
01:56:31,800 --> 01:56:35,980
The stickers you see that are not related to my friends and people I collab with.

2695
01:56:36,120 --> 01:56:37,920
They will not be sold as merch.

2696
01:56:38,100 --> 01:56:41,800
They will not be sold as merch, by the way.

2697
01:56:44,100 --> 01:56:44,960
What else?

2698
01:56:45,100 --> 01:56:45,380
What else?

2699
01:56:45,640 --> 01:56:45,960
Whoa!

2700
01:56:46,100 --> 01:56:48,060
These are the icons from the character select.

2701
01:56:48,280 --> 01:56:49,480
So, some of them did like friends.

2702
01:56:49,560 --> 01:56:50,660
Yes, my Oshii is there.

2703
01:56:50,720 --> 01:56:51,320
Thomas Edison.

2704
01:56:51,680 --> 01:56:52,620
My Oshii.

2705
01:56:53,140 --> 01:56:55,360
So, Black did the icons.

2706
01:56:55,360 --> 01:56:56,060
The icons.

2707
01:56:56,060 --> 01:56:58,780
The icons for the character select and my friends list.

2708
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:03,260
So, I specifically requested that I wanted Thomas Edison.

2709
01:57:03,720 --> 01:57:04,880
My Oshii.

2710
01:57:07,640 --> 01:57:10,780
I was very specific.

2711
01:57:11,680 --> 01:57:14,760
Thomas Edison had to be on my friends list.

2712
01:57:15,840 --> 01:57:16,740
I don't know what...

2713
01:57:16,740 --> 01:57:20,000
I'm not sure what to use the icons for as merch yet.

2714
01:57:20,560 --> 01:57:23,320
So, that's something I'm still thinking of at the moment.

2715
01:57:24,380 --> 01:57:27,280
So, I don't know yet what I want to do the icons as.

2716
01:57:28,160 --> 01:57:29,100
But, yeah.

2717
01:57:29,220 --> 01:57:32,360
Like the icons that are not based off of my friends.

2718
01:57:33,460 --> 01:57:35,340
Maybe I'll sell Thomas Edison though.

2719
01:57:36,940 --> 01:57:39,680
I will sell Thomas Edison Oshii.

2720
01:57:39,760 --> 01:57:41,980
Like he's public domain at this point.

2721
01:57:42,060 --> 01:57:45,600
So, I'm legally allowed to make merch off of him.

2722
01:57:45,680 --> 01:57:47,460
Because he's been dead for more than a hundred years.

2723
01:57:47,720 --> 01:57:49,160
So, he's public domain, baby.

2724
01:57:53,520 --> 01:57:55,880
I can legally make merch off of him.

2725
01:57:58,240 --> 01:58:01,040
And finally, here are some screenshots of the maps.

2726
01:58:01,420 --> 01:58:03,740
The set dressing that everybody did.

2727
01:58:04,720 --> 01:58:06,320
It's free real estate, exactly.

2728
01:58:06,800 --> 01:58:09,320
The best thing about being a Vtuber is that we never die.

2729
01:58:09,540 --> 01:58:11,120
So, like we'll never be public domain.

2730
01:58:14,200 --> 01:58:17,380
And here are the maps of everything.

2731
01:58:17,820 --> 01:58:18,700
Oh my gosh.

2732
01:58:18,880 --> 01:58:19,340
Sorry.

2733
01:58:19,420 --> 01:58:22,340
A lot of the stream was talking about behind the scenes and projects.

2734
01:58:22,340 --> 01:58:25,040
Even though this isn't the behind the scenes and everything.

2735
01:58:25,240 --> 01:58:25,620
Oh my god.

2736
01:58:25,700 --> 01:58:26,240
It looks so amazing.

2737
01:58:27,920 --> 01:58:30,760
Yeah, Thomas Edison Web wanted me to make money off.

2738
01:58:30,840 --> 01:58:31,240
Exactly.

2739
01:58:31,420 --> 01:58:33,200
I'm only doing what my Oshii wants.

2740
01:58:33,360 --> 01:58:34,080
But it's so pretty.

2741
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:36,460
Alright.

2742
01:58:36,600 --> 01:58:39,020
Back to Cowboy.

2743
01:58:41,340 --> 01:58:43,800
My scenes are named pretty funny.

2744
01:58:43,920 --> 01:58:45,820
Back to Cowboy Chatty.

2745
01:58:49,240 --> 01:58:49,700
Alright.

2746
01:58:49,840 --> 01:58:50,920
It's time for you to...

2747
01:58:51,480 --> 01:58:52,280
Get off.

2748
01:58:52,520 --> 01:58:52,680
Alright.

2749
01:58:52,740 --> 01:58:53,200
Here we go.

2750
01:58:53,880 --> 01:58:54,280
Um...

2751
01:58:54,280 --> 01:58:58,920
I'm trying to remember if I'm missing anything before we go to green screen time.

2752
01:58:59,120 --> 01:59:00,360
Am I missing anything?

2753
01:59:00,800 --> 01:59:01,180
Oh yeah.

2754
01:59:01,240 --> 01:59:02,860
I wrote a list of stuff I need to talk about.

2755
01:59:03,160 --> 01:59:03,560
Sorry.

2756
01:59:03,640 --> 01:59:04,060
I knew I...

2757
01:59:04,060 --> 01:59:05,400
Remember I wrote a script.

2758
01:59:05,520 --> 01:59:06,060
Not a script.

2759
01:59:06,240 --> 01:59:09,900
But like general set up of everything I need to say.

2760
01:59:10,100 --> 01:59:10,380
Yes!

2761
01:59:10,460 --> 01:59:12,100
Music will be public to everybody too!

2762
01:59:12,220 --> 01:59:12,920
I will make sure.

2763
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:15,020
I want to upload the music itself.

2764
01:59:15,360 --> 01:59:18,240
But I'm trying to figure out how to upload it and stuff.

2765
01:59:18,300 --> 01:59:19,040
Like not how to upload.

2766
01:59:19,060 --> 01:59:20,680
Like I don't know how to use YouTube upload.

2767
01:59:20,720 --> 01:59:20,900
Like I don't know how to use YouTube upload.

2768
01:59:20,920 --> 01:59:22,700
But more so like what kind of music.

2769
01:59:22,700 --> 01:59:24,160
If I want to make a music video or something.

2770
01:59:24,440 --> 01:59:26,080
Or like... I don't know.

2771
01:59:26,120 --> 01:59:26,700
I'm not sure yet.

2772
01:59:26,880 --> 01:59:31,560
But I will have the music available to the public as well.

2773
01:59:31,720 --> 01:59:33,140
Things that will be available to the public.

2774
01:59:33,600 --> 01:59:36,320
The 3D models of the dragoons.

2775
01:59:36,360 --> 01:59:37,120
Plus tomato.

2776
01:59:37,280 --> 01:59:38,400
Plus Retro Doki.

2777
01:59:39,320 --> 01:59:39,800

01:59:46,760 --> 01:59:48,060
And... What else did I write?

2782
01:59:48,180 --> 01:59:49,220
And the music.

2783
01:59:49,220 --> 01:59:49,900
Yes.

2784
01:59:50,080 --> 01:59:51,320

2785
01:59:51,500 --> 01:59:53,580

2786
01:59:53,920 --> 01:59:55,260
Framed by... Like the frames.

2787
01:59:55,440 --> 01:59:58,020
Will be shown... Given in members only.

2788
01:59:58,060 --> 02:00:01,080
That will be the only members exclusive that I'm gonna have.

2789
02:00:03,160 --> 02:00:03,680
Um...

2790
02:00:03,680 --> 02:00:04,340
Um...

2791
02:00:04,340 --> 02:00:05,320

2792
02:00:05,480 --> 02:00:05,780
Oh yeah!

There's gonna be a lot of other announcements too on birthday.

2797
02:00:11,540 --> 02:00:15,680
So this is not just the only announcement that we're gonna have.

2798
02:00:16,260 --> 02:00:16,780
Oh!

2799
02:00:16,940 --> 02:00:17,680

02:00:17,980 --> 02:00:18,420

2801
02:00:18,500 --> 02:00:19,140
You're right!

2802
02:00:19,140 --> 02:00:20,280
Alright guys.

2803
02:00:20,520 --> 02:00:21,700

2804
02:00:22,120 --> 02:00:22,560

02:00:24,420 --> 02:00:26,000
Thank you for the reminder.

2806
02:00:26,260 --> 02:00:28,060
I should've just looked at my...

2807
02:00:28,060 --> 02:00:28,280
Um...

2808
02:00:28,820 --> 02:00:30,160
I should've just looked at my folder.

2809
02:00:30,360 --> 02:00:31,360
Cause like my folder has...

2810
02:00:31,360 --> 02:00:32,100
Okay so...

2811
02:00:32,100 --> 02:00:34,520
I need to show you guys the very first concept art.

2812
02:00:34,600 --> 02:00:35,580
Because like it's...

2813
02:00:36,180 --> 02:00:36,620
Um...

2814
02:00:37,560 --> 02:00:39,220
So... The very first one...

2815
02:00:39,220 --> 02:00:40,280
Was actually with Kleia.

2816
02:00:41,700 --> 02:00:42,140
Um...

2817
02:00:42,140 --> 02:00:42,660
Um...

2818
02:00:42,660 --> 02:00:44,620
Cause at first I was like maybe I'll just get a new outfit.

2819
02:00:44,920 --> 02:00:47,440
A new like redesign slash new outfit.

2820
02:00:48,100 --> 02:00:49,060
Uh... With Kleia.

2821
02:00:49,060 --> 02:00:50,100
So...

2822
02:00:50,100 --> 02:00:53,080
We were debating on like a...

2823
02:00:53,680 --> 02:00:54,500
Okay let me...

2824
02:00:54,500 --> 02:00:55,920
I need to move myself a little bit.

2825
02:00:55,960 --> 02:00:57,140
Oh I don't wanna move myself though.

2826
02:00:57,340 --> 02:00:57,700
Okay.

2827
02:00:58,180 --> 02:00:59,360
Let me...

2828
02:00:59,360 --> 02:01:00,840
Move myself here.

2829
02:01:01,220 --> 02:01:01,740
So...

2830
02:01:01,740 --> 02:01:02,660
The very fir...

2831
02:01:02,660 --> 02:01:03,260
Oh my gosh.

2832
02:01:03,280 --> 02:01:04,120
Wait give me a sec.

2833
02:01:04,440 --> 02:01:04,840
Uh...

2834
02:01:07,340 --> 02:01:08,380
Oh no.

2835
02:01:08,580 --> 02:01:09,320
Oh no.

2836
02:01:09,420 --> 02:01:09,620
Okay.

2837
02:01:09,880 --> 02:01:10,400
No.

2838
02:01:10,400 --> 02:01:10,880
Okay.

2839
02:01:10,980 --> 02:01:11,680
Here you go.

2840
02:01:11,840 --> 02:01:12,540
Alright here you go.

2841
02:01:12,620 --> 02:01:13,280
Alright that's better.

2842
02:01:13,460 --> 02:01:14,540
Alright so...

2843
02:01:15,180 --> 02:01:15,700
Um...

2844
02:01:15,700 --> 02:01:16,580
It was...

2845
02:01:16,580 --> 02:01:17,280
Um...

2846
02:01:17,280 --> 02:01:18,980
Polar bear and rat.

2847
02:01:21,640 --> 02:01:22,920
For the...

2848
02:01:22,920 --> 02:01:24,900
For the very first...

2849
02:01:25,820 --> 02:01:26,620
Um...

2850
02:01:26,620 --> 02:01:28,340
The very first concept.

2851
02:01:28,580 --> 02:01:29,480
We were like...

2852
02:01:29,480 --> 02:01:29,820
Ooh...

2853
02:01:29,820 --> 02:01:30,820
Maybe like...

2854
02:01:30,820 --> 02:01:31,840
Polar bear...

2855
02:01:31,840 --> 02:01:33,420
Rat themed or something.

2856
02:01:33,800 --> 02:01:34,500
So...

2857
02:01:34,500 --> 02:01:35,400
That was the...

2858
02:01:35,400 --> 02:01:36,480
Oh my gosh let me move...

2859
02:01:36,480 --> 02:01:37,160
Move myself.

2860
02:01:39,120 --> 02:01:41,300
No if I move myself...

2861
02:01:41,300 --> 02:01:42,360
Then like...

2862
02:01:42,360 --> 02:01:43,280
No...

2863
02:01:43,280 --> 02:01:45,580
I'm gonna be...

2864
02:01:45,580 --> 02:01:46,540
Okay so...

2865
02:01:46,540 --> 02:01:47,040
Um...

2866
02:01:47,040 --> 02:01:47,860
Originally...

2867
02:01:47,860 --> 02:01:48,220
I was like...

2868
02:01:48,220 --> 02:01:48,620
It was...

2869
02:01:48,620 --> 02:01:49,860
I was debating between...

2870
02:01:49,860 --> 02:01:51,160
Maybe I should do polar bear...

2871
02:01:51,160 --> 02:01:51,820
Or...

2872
02:01:51,820 --> 02:01:53,140
It looks like I'm trying to drink this.

2873
02:01:56,820 --> 02:01:59,560
But then I was like...

2874
02:01:59,560 --> 02:02:00,880
No that doesn't make sense cause I'm...

2875
02:02:00,880 --> 02:02:01,980
Doki bird.

2876
02:02:02,400 --> 02:02:06,080
Oh my gosh this is not gonna make sense because like I can't change Doki bird.

2877
02:02:06,380 --> 02:02:06,760
I...

2878
02:02:06,760 --> 02:02:07,300
I can't...

2879
02:02:07,300 --> 02:02:07,500
I...

2880
02:02:07,500 --> 02:02:09,680
I can't change Doki bird.

2881
02:02:09,880 --> 02:02:11,840
So it wouldn't make sense.

2882
02:02:12,460 --> 02:02:12,940
So...

2883
02:02:12,940 --> 02:02:13,900
We were like...

2884
02:02:13,900 --> 02:02:14,500
Okay...

2885
02:02:14,500 --> 02:02:15,000
We...

2886
02:02:15,000 --> 02:02:15,920
Pivoted.

2887
02:02:16,300 --> 02:02:16,780
And...

2888
02:02:16,780 --> 02:02:17,220
Um...

2889
02:02:17,220 --> 02:02:17,860
My...

2890
02:02:17,860 --> 02:02:18,020
My...

2891
02:02:18,020 --> 02:02:18,040
My...

2892
02:02:18,040 --> 02:02:18,060
My...

2893
02:02:18,060 --> 02:02:18,200
My...

2894
02:02:18,880 --> 02:02:20,940
My new mama joined the team.

2895
02:02:21,280 --> 02:02:21,760
Uh...

2896
02:02:21,760 --> 02:02:23,080
Trying to figure something out.

2897
02:02:23,440 --> 02:02:25,140
And at first we were gonna be like...

2898
02:02:25,140 --> 02:02:25,640
Thief.

2899
02:02:25,880 --> 02:02:26,280
Alright.

2900
02:02:26,420 --> 02:02:26,900
Thief.

2901
02:02:27,700 --> 02:02:28,180
So...

2902
02:02:29,280 --> 02:02:29,760
Um...

2903
02:02:30,420 --> 02:02:30,900
This...

2904
02:02:30,900 --> 02:02:32,400
Oh you're just not gonna see me.

2905
02:02:32,560 --> 02:02:34,520
I can't be bothered right now.

2906
02:02:37,380 --> 02:02:37,860
So...

2907
02:02:37,860 --> 02:02:38,780
Um...

2908
02:02:38,780 --> 02:02:39,900
I was like...

2909
02:02:39,900 --> 02:02:40,760
I want...

2910
02:02:40,760 --> 02:02:42,580
Dad to be part of me.

2911
02:02:42,680 --> 02:02:44,600
But then I think we had like a miscommunication.

2912
02:02:45,520 --> 02:02:46,000
And...

2913
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:46,560
Um...

2914
02:02:46,560 --> 02:02:47,460
We were like...

2915
02:02:47,460 --> 02:02:48,180
I don't know.

2916
02:02:48,200 --> 02:02:48,820
Uh...

2917
02:02:48,820 --> 02:02:51,700
My mama thought that I just literally wanted a...

2918
02:02:52,160 --> 02:02:52,380
Uh...

2919
02:02:52,380 --> 02:02:53,900
My wiener dog to be there.

2920
02:02:54,080 --> 02:02:54,840
And then I was like...

2921
02:02:54,840 --> 02:02:55,300
Maybe not.

2922
02:02:55,440 --> 02:02:55,960
I don't know.

2923
02:02:55,980 --> 02:02:57,380
I felt like too tacky for me.

2924
02:02:57,440 --> 02:02:58,100
To have...

2925
02:02:58,100 --> 02:02:58,920
Uh...

2926
02:02:58,920 --> 02:02:59,260
My...

2927
02:02:59,260 --> 02:03:00,080
Cause you can see like...

2928
02:03:00,080 --> 02:03:01,400
Bee was a dog walker.

2929
02:03:02,360 --> 02:03:03,460
I was like...

2930
02:03:03,460 --> 02:03:05,740
I don't know if I want to be a dog walker.

2931
02:03:12,360 --> 02:03:17,080
I don't know if I want to be a dog walker.

2932
02:03:19,500 --> 02:03:21,640
That was like my new job.

2933
02:03:21,780 --> 02:03:22,140
Um...

2934
02:03:22,160 --> 02:03:23,260
Dog walking.

2935
02:03:24,720 --> 02:03:26,780
But I love the hair in B!

2936
02:03:27,100 --> 02:03:30,920
I love the... I love the hairstyle in B.

2937
02:03:34,440 --> 02:03:36,400
B was our favorite hairstyle.

2938
02:03:36,800 --> 02:03:39,560
So we kept the B hairstyle as you guys can see.

2939
02:03:39,820 --> 02:03:44,440
B was like my favorite hairstyle out of all of them.

2940
02:03:44,620 --> 02:03:47,140
So we were like, okay, we're not gonna do dog.

2941
02:03:47,420 --> 02:03:50,620
But I was like, oh, I still want like dad to be representative.

2942
02:03:50,940 --> 02:03:53,420
And then so... so my...

2943
02:03:54,320 --> 02:03:58,740
My mama was like, oh, okay, which one you want to be to be dad?

2944
02:03:59,140 --> 02:04:00,400
I was like, I don't know.

2945
02:04:03,500 --> 02:04:04,340
I don't know.

2946
02:04:04,500 --> 02:04:05,780
So I was like, I don't really know.

2947
02:04:05,880 --> 02:04:06,740
It doesn't really fit.

2948
02:04:06,920 --> 02:04:08,120
It doesn't really fit.

2949
02:04:08,280 --> 02:04:18,240
I felt like... I guess like the crow too, but I was like, what the fuck is F?

2950
02:04:21,600 --> 02:04:21,980
F for dog.

2951
02:04:24,240 --> 02:04:25,660
And then so...

2952
02:04:27,560 --> 02:04:30,400
So we were talking about like concepts of...

2953
02:04:31,800 --> 02:04:32,940
Okay, the hats really.

2954
02:04:33,020 --> 02:04:34,800
It was like tuxedo mask type shit.

2955
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:38,040
And then... and then... and then so then we were discussing more.

2956
02:04:38,100 --> 02:04:41,440
I was like, I think I want more like canine-esque type deal.

2957
02:04:41,640 --> 02:04:43,340
Like more canine-esque.

2958
02:04:43,380 --> 02:04:43,940
So then we...

2959
02:04:43,940 --> 02:04:44,720
Okay.

2960
02:04:44,900 --> 02:04:45,340
Okay.

2961
02:04:45,440 --> 02:04:46,780
And then we're like thief too.

2962
02:04:46,880 --> 02:04:51,180
We were like thief and then canine and then... alright.

2963
02:04:51,300 --> 02:04:53,320
D is a fucking riot though.

2964
02:04:57,360 --> 02:04:57,800
I was like, if you want to go with D then go with D.

2965
02:04:57,800 --> 02:05:00,880
Okay, not gonna lie but D though!

2966
02:05:05,220 --> 02:05:06,000
I love.

2967
02:05:06,100 --> 02:05:11,280
So I saw F and I was like I love... okay, F was like, F it is.

2968
02:05:11,540 --> 02:05:17,040
And then we went with... we were like, I was like, I think I would like some a lighter shade and...

2969
02:05:17,860 --> 02:05:19,440
Okay, D is pretty funny.

2970
02:05:19,540 --> 02:05:21,040
I wish you could have seen...

2971
02:05:21,580 --> 02:05:23,660
Oh my god, I talked about this before.

2972
02:05:23,860 --> 02:05:25,020
But I wish you guys...

2973
02:05:25,020 --> 02:05:31,860
I also have known what like... Doki Amber Doge with a fucking... with like a gangster costume.

2974
02:05:32,200 --> 02:05:34,280
That was the funniest shit ever.

2975
02:05:34,480 --> 02:05:35,360
That was so good.

2976
02:05:35,480 --> 02:05:37,680
I wish we... you guys saw that.

2977
02:05:41,300 --> 02:05:44,180
You guys might remember me talking about it.

2978
02:05:44,220 --> 02:05:45,140
Mint's seen it.

2979
02:05:45,740 --> 02:05:52,200
Mint... I remember like... I remember when I showed Mint gangster Doki Amber Doge.

2980
02:05:52,200 --> 02:05:55,140
Like it lives rent-free in her mind.

2981
02:05:57,160 --> 02:05:58,120
I can't.

2982
02:05:58,120 --> 02:05:58,980
I can't show it.

2983
02:05:59,040 --> 02:06:00,100
I told you guys.

2984
02:06:00,200 --> 02:06:01,700
Here's the reason why I can't show it.

2985
02:06:01,740 --> 02:06:04,240
Because it was before Doki Amber Doge.

2986
02:06:05,760 --> 02:06:07,680
Is Doki Amber Doge.

2987
02:06:10,960 --> 02:06:16,500
Anyway, so we were talking about like what if we keep the twin tails and still go with the thief.

2988
02:06:16,620 --> 02:06:20,820
The thing is... okay the hardest part about rebranding and...

2989
02:06:22,200 --> 02:06:36,120
rebranding and everything is that I was had to make a decision on whether or not I am keeping the thief theme or going with a whole new different idea.

2990
02:06:37,800 --> 02:06:51,580
I decided it was a very hard decision but I decided to go with a rebrand with a new skin suit design and a new skin suit idea because I was like...

2991
02:06:52,200 --> 02:06:57,820
um I felt like the thief thing was like four years ago Doki.

2992
02:06:58,060 --> 02:07:01,020
You know it was like four years ago Doki.

2993
02:07:02,820 --> 02:07:08,260
The thief was originally not even based off of me.

2994
02:07:08,520 --> 02:07:11,620
It was actually some random...

2995
02:07:11,620 --> 02:07:12,800
I like took over her.

2996
02:07:18,340 --> 02:07:20,960
I... I did full metal alch...

2997
02:07:20,960 --> 02:07:21,280
...

2998
02:07:22,260 --> 02:07:24,140
It was alchemy.

2999
02:07:24,220 --> 02:07:27,700
I created this character and I...

3000
02:07:28,960 --> 02:07:35,400
I skin walked her so she wasn't even supposed to represent me in the first place.

3001
02:07:35,720 --> 02:07:38,160
And then later on she was like...

3002
02:07:38,160 --> 02:07:40,160
I used her as me.

3003
02:07:40,380 --> 02:07:42,800
I took over her form as a tomato.

3004
02:07:43,120 --> 02:07:49,840
And um... and so she was never really representative of how I felt like I was.

3005
02:07:50,180 --> 02:07:51,960
Um but she was...

3006
02:07:52,920 --> 02:07:54,860
Retro Doki is very close to my heart.

3007
02:07:54,920 --> 02:07:56,740
The skin suit is very close to my heart.

3008
02:07:56,800 --> 02:08:01,380
The design concept everything is very close to my heart because I've had that...

3009
02:08:01,380 --> 02:08:04,540
I've skin walked her for like 10 plus years.

3010
02:08:09,060 --> 02:08:09,580
Um...

3011
02:08:11,120 --> 02:08:13,620
Um so I wanted...

3012
02:08:13,620 --> 02:08:21,100
I was like I really wanted something that's more like me and I figured Bounty Hunter because...

3013
02:08:21,100 --> 02:08:21,700
Okay not...

3014
02:08:21,700 --> 02:08:22,780
I didn't think of Bounty Hunter.

3015
02:08:22,900 --> 02:08:27,720
My mama thought of Bounty Hunter because I was like I wanted something more FPS themed.

3016
02:08:27,900 --> 02:08:30,340
And I didn't really like the super long hair.

3017
02:08:30,520 --> 02:08:34,160
So I was like okay what if we go with more tomboy-esque short hair.

3018
02:08:34,360 --> 02:08:37,620
So uh we got to here.

3019
02:08:38,180 --> 02:08:39,480
This is where we got to.

3020
02:08:39,960 --> 02:08:42,400
Um oh my gosh you can actually see me now.

3021
02:08:42,600 --> 02:08:47,620
Uh this was um after that I was like um...

3022
02:08:48,900 --> 02:08:51,520
I was like okay um...

3023
02:08:51,520 --> 02:08:57,120
I want an FPS themed and uh and I wanted...

3024
02:08:57,120 --> 02:08:58,740
I don't like tech wear.

3025
02:08:58,920 --> 02:09:01,180
I straight up was like no tech wear.

3026
02:09:05,680 --> 02:09:08,900
So I was like I don't want tech wear.

3027
02:09:09,220 --> 02:09:20,700
So my mama was like well that's really difficult because what we can do is either Bounty Hunter or like military and I didn't go with one because...

3028
02:09:20,700 --> 02:09:21,500
Um...

3029
02:09:21,520 --> 02:09:23,320
It looked too much like Shibuya Hal.

3030
02:09:23,560 --> 02:09:25,180
So I was like...

3031
02:09:26,400 --> 02:09:27,380
I didn't want...

3032
02:09:27,380 --> 02:09:32,260
Look I did want to do like what Shibuya Hal does but in like NA western scene.

3033
02:09:32,600 --> 02:09:36,320
But I was like I don't want to be actually Shibuya Hal.

3034
02:09:40,900 --> 02:09:44,760
I don't want to be actually Shibuya Hal.

3035
02:09:45,420 --> 02:09:48,340
So um...

3036
02:09:49,480 --> 02:09:51,040
Left eye patch.

3037
02:09:51,240 --> 02:09:51,500
Left eye patch.

3038
02:09:51,500 --> 02:10:06,420
Anyway so I was just like okay we're gonna go I love and I really liked the uh I really really really liked the Bounty Hunter theme but you can see that we changed more so like cowboy-esque because another thing I...

3039
02:10:06,960 --> 02:10:10,240
I felt like the jacket okay it's gonna be so annoying.

3040
02:10:10,420 --> 02:10:21,480
I felt like the jacket having the collars up would I felt it was too boyish like I would be a tomboy but I still didn't want to be like super duper boyish.

3041
02:10:21,480 --> 02:10:46,600
And everything so I was like um I and I felt like the the jacket thing is like it would cover the screen too much it like it might cover the screen too much because it was long and I was like thinking I was thinking like um okay let's have the collar down and um I want to keep it keep it more simple.

3042
02:10:46,920 --> 02:10:51,460
I need I wanted to have it more simple as well because I don't like it.

3043
02:10:51,460 --> 02:11:18,880
I don't like having super over designed stuff I just want to have like a brand that was like that's me like I don't want to be like super duper over design and stuff like that so I like uh kept it more simple and everything I also had uh uh oh yeah I meant I don't know you were here earlier but we were talking about remember gangster gangster dad wait no it was like rapper dad.

3044
02:11:19,200 --> 02:11:20,760
You remember gangster dad?

3045
02:11:20,760 --> 02:11:21,020
You remember gangster dad?

3046
02:11:21,020 --> 02:11:21,340
You remember gangster dad?

3047
02:11:21,460 --> 02:11:34,440
I don't know if you saw the other I I don't know you were there earlier while showing like earlier concepts of of of dad but like I was talking about yeah I wish you guys saw rapper dad I don't know what really it was.

3048
02:11:34,880 --> 02:11:37,540
I always think about him sometimes.

3049
02:11:39,440 --> 02:11:46,500
Anyway, I also had Kley a help out as well and give like her take on like bounty hunter and stuff.

3050
02:11:46,720 --> 02:11:51,440
Um this was when we decided to do like a smaller jacket as well cause I felt like long jackets, like like bounce.

3051
02:11:51,440 --> 02:11:52,560
This was a little bit overdone.

3052
02:11:52,640 --> 02:11:54,840
We don't really see like short jackets and stuff.

3053
02:11:55,040 --> 02:11:56,720
So, Clea was also...

3054
02:11:59,320 --> 02:12:04,120
giving like insight and stuff on like different concepts and everything.

3055
02:12:04,820 --> 02:12:05,400
And...

3056
02:12:05,970 --> 02:12:07,520
Hey guys, be saucier.

3057
02:12:11,210 --> 02:12:15,360
So, Clea was also giving like input and stuff for us as well.

3058
02:12:15,540 --> 02:12:17,360
Like giving us what like...

3059
02:12:17,360 --> 02:12:20,920
cheat things would look good as a bounty hunter.

3060
02:12:21,200 --> 02:12:22,800
And then we also have this as well.

3061
02:12:23,740 --> 02:12:26,100
We played around a lot with stuff.

3062
02:12:26,300 --> 02:12:27,160
It was so difficult.

3063
02:12:27,380 --> 02:12:28,400
It was so difficult.

3064
02:12:29,400 --> 02:12:40,580
Because like... I feel like designing, having another kit... like just having a new skin suit is such a difficult process in general.

3065
02:12:40,840 --> 02:12:44,680
So, we had these from Clea.

3066
02:12:44,900 --> 02:12:48,220
And then we were given this as well.

3067
02:12:49,340 --> 02:12:50,520
I was like, no.

3068
02:12:55,120 --> 02:12:56,980
I saw this.

3069
02:12:57,300 --> 02:12:58,840
I was like, I don't know.

3070
02:12:58,900 --> 02:13:00,820
Now it looks like I'm showing off.

3071
02:13:04,160 --> 02:13:11,100
I felt like... I felt like I was showing off at that point.

3072
02:13:16,200 --> 02:13:18,800
So, I was like... I was straight up was like, no.

3073
02:13:19,100 --> 02:13:19,800
I know.

3074
02:13:21,280 --> 02:13:22,140
Too bright.

3075
02:13:25,380 --> 02:13:27,280
I was like, too bright.

3076
02:13:27,560 --> 02:13:29,180
I can't.

3077
02:13:29,280 --> 02:13:30,880
That's... it's too bright.

3078
02:13:31,100 --> 02:13:31,820
I can't.

3079
02:13:31,820 --> 02:13:32,580
I feel like...

3080
02:13:32,580 --> 02:13:34,180
it's not... I don't know.

3081
02:13:34,280 --> 02:13:35,560
I don't know if I like this.

3082
02:13:35,640 --> 02:13:36,020
Yeehaw.

3083
02:13:36,160 --> 02:13:37,240
I don't know.

3084
02:13:39,500 --> 02:13:43,640
And then in the end... in the end, we got to...

3085
02:13:44,140 --> 02:13:45,060
This is... oh wait.

3086
02:13:45,080 --> 02:13:45,220
No.

3087
02:13:45,220 --> 02:13:46,040
This is not the end.

3088
02:13:46,120 --> 02:13:47,640
Because we had a different clip too.

3089
02:13:48,400 --> 02:13:50,060
We had... dad was...

3090
02:13:50,160 --> 02:13:51,900
a little darker... darker fur.

3091
02:13:52,120 --> 02:13:58,240
And then we had different clip because we thought like, oh, maybe like a... a bullet arrow.

3092
02:13:58,480 --> 02:14:00,380
But it didn't look as good as I thought.

3093
02:14:00,540 --> 02:14:02,440
So, we scrapped that.

3094
02:14:02,540 --> 02:14:03,780
But all of this stayed the same.

3095
02:14:04,040 --> 02:14:05,160
All of that stayed the same.

3096
02:14:05,240 --> 02:14:05,940
Just not this.

3097
02:14:06,700 --> 02:14:11,680
It was a different... she gave us the X hair clip earlier.

3098
02:14:12,080 --> 02:14:17,720
And then... I was just like... actually, it doesn't look as good.

3099
02:14:17,800 --> 02:14:18,300
I thought...

3100
02:14:18,300 --> 02:14:21,420
I was like, what about the bullet arrow?

3101
02:14:21,760 --> 02:14:22,600
A bullet arrow.

3102
02:14:22,760 --> 02:14:24,400
And then we saw that and I was like, Ah!

3103
02:14:25,820 --> 02:14:27,580
They look as good as I expected!

3104
02:14:28,020 --> 02:14:29,580
So we scrapped that.

3105
02:14:29,720 --> 02:14:31,360
And went straight back to the default.

3106
02:14:31,820 --> 02:14:33,060
So yeah, anyway.

3107
02:14:33,920 --> 02:14:39,060
A lot of the inspiration I gave regarding notes I gave for inspiration and stuff.

3108
02:14:39,260 --> 02:14:41,340
I was like, I really want...

3109
02:14:42,140 --> 02:14:46,640
Like, I sent designs of the Mandalorian.

3110
02:14:48,360 --> 02:14:48,820
Mandalorian.

3111
02:14:50,500 --> 02:14:52,040
Sniper from Team Fortress 2.

3112
02:14:52,920 --> 02:14:54,360
Cassidy from Overwatch.

3113
02:14:56,640 --> 02:14:57,100
And...

3114
02:14:58,460 --> 02:14:59,900
Look, this was later, okay?

3115
02:14:59,960 --> 02:15:05,060
I know some of you guys were like, Oh, were you trying to copy the ghoul from Fallout?

3116
02:15:05,440 --> 02:15:06,800
I gave that later.

3117
02:15:07,100 --> 02:15:09,140
After we had the initial concept.

3118
02:15:09,320 --> 02:15:09,780
Okay?

3119
02:15:16,680 --> 02:15:20,120
I did give the ghoul at a later point.

3120
02:15:20,320 --> 02:15:22,480
I did give the ghoul at a later point.

3121
02:15:22,780 --> 02:15:26,080
But that was later in the process.

3122
02:15:26,180 --> 02:15:29,480
It was later in the process, okay?

3123
02:15:29,800 --> 02:15:31,480
Because I know the ghoul.

3124
02:15:31,620 --> 02:15:32,100
Yeehaw.

3125
02:15:35,420 --> 02:15:36,320
But yes.

3126
02:15:36,640 --> 02:15:41,540
Those were like the design concepts I gave my mama.

3127
02:15:41,660 --> 02:15:44,500
Regarding like how I would like to see in vision.

3128
02:15:44,720 --> 02:15:45,320
Bounty.

3129
02:15:46,180 --> 02:15:46,780
Bounty hunter.

3130
02:15:47,020 --> 02:15:48,080
And stuff like that.

3131
02:15:48,620 --> 02:15:49,960
And this is how I was born.

3132
02:15:50,380 --> 02:15:50,620
Not...

3133
02:15:50,620 --> 02:15:50,880
Wait, no.

3134
02:15:50,980 --> 02:15:51,460
Not born.

3135
02:15:51,560 --> 02:15:52,740
My skin suit was made.

3136
02:15:53,020 --> 02:15:54,480
This is how I've always been born.

3137
02:15:54,580 --> 02:15:57,740
But this is how my skin suit was created.

3138
02:15:58,260 --> 02:15:59,660
It was a super long process.

3139
02:16:00,420 --> 02:16:01,560
A lot of back and forth.

3140
02:16:01,660 --> 02:16:02,860
A lot of like, I'm scared.

3141
02:16:04,940 --> 02:16:07,500
A lot of like, oh my god.

3142
02:16:07,540 --> 02:16:08,520
I'm so fucking scared.

3143
02:16:08,700 --> 02:16:10,180
I don't know how they're going to react.

3144
02:16:10,520 --> 02:16:10,920
Oh.

3145
02:16:11,240 --> 02:16:11,640
Oh.

3146
02:16:14,900 --> 02:16:15,300
Oh.

3147
02:16:15,300 --> 02:16:16,140
Let me see.

3148
02:16:16,200 --> 02:16:16,520
But yes.

3149
02:16:16,620 --> 02:16:18,040
It is going to be a...

3150
02:16:19,580 --> 02:16:20,100
Okay.

3151
02:16:20,280 --> 02:16:20,580
Okay.

3152
02:16:20,740 --> 02:16:22,020
Just you reminded me.

3153
02:16:22,100 --> 02:16:24,520
I will show you guys the reference sheet.

3154
02:16:25,100 --> 02:16:25,620
Okay?

3155
02:16:26,280 --> 02:16:29,240
I will show you guys the reference.

3156
02:16:29,560 --> 02:16:30,080
Guys.

3157
02:16:30,320 --> 02:16:31,520
I'll show you...

3158
02:16:31,520 --> 02:16:37,820
All right.

3159
02:16:38,380 --> 02:16:38,900
Okay.

3160
02:16:38,980 --> 02:16:39,600
So this is...

3161
02:16:39,600 --> 02:16:42,760
I'll be posting this on Twitter later.

3162
02:16:42,960 --> 02:16:43,480
But...

3163
02:16:43,480 --> 02:16:47,820
This is the first reference sheet where you see the backside.

3164
02:16:48,040 --> 02:16:49,440
The design on the back.

3165
02:16:50,300 --> 02:16:51,680
The design on the side.

3166
02:16:52,060 --> 02:16:52,840
And everything.

3167
02:16:53,240 --> 02:16:53,480
No!

3168
02:16:53,680 --> 02:16:54,120
No!

3169
02:16:55,000 --> 02:16:55,560
Stop.

3170
02:16:55,920 --> 02:16:57,080
And then...

3171
02:16:57,080 --> 02:16:57,780
This!

3172
02:16:59,200 --> 02:17:00,120
There you go.

3173
02:17:00,200 --> 02:17:00,720
You see that?

3174
02:17:01,380 --> 02:17:02,180
Right here.

3175
02:17:02,240 --> 02:17:04,100
That's a bump right here.

3176
02:17:05,580 --> 02:17:06,140
Okay.

3177
02:17:06,360 --> 02:17:07,240
Funny story.

3178
02:17:07,900 --> 02:17:08,740
It was...

3179
02:17:08,740 --> 02:17:10,820
There was originally no bump.

3180
02:17:11,140 --> 02:17:13,140
And then I was like, can we have a little...

3181
02:17:13,140 --> 02:17:13,460
Can we have a little...

3182
02:17:13,480 --> 02:17:14,820
Can we add...

3183
02:17:19,040 --> 02:17:20,720
Can we add...

3184
02:17:20,720 --> 02:17:20,920
Okay.

3185
02:17:21,120 --> 02:17:23,740
I specifically...

3186
02:17:23,740 --> 02:17:27,660
I specifically requested.

3187
02:17:30,240 --> 02:17:35,620
Because there was zero bump at first.

3188
02:17:35,940 --> 02:17:38,740
And then I was like, can we have...

3189
02:17:38,740 --> 02:17:41,420
Can we add two more letters in there?

3190
02:17:42,200 --> 02:17:47,860
Can we at least go up two more letters?

3191
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:49,260
That's all I ask.

3192
02:17:49,400 --> 02:17:52,700
I just want to go up two more letters.

3193
02:17:55,040 --> 02:17:59,100
If you guys need extra eyes, do not worry.

3194
02:17:59,620 --> 02:18:04,080
But right here... right here...

3195
02:18:04,080 --> 02:18:04,380
Whoa!

3196
02:18:04,700 --> 02:18:05,220
Sorry!

3197
02:18:05,980 --> 02:18:08,020
Sorry, I got a little overzealous here.

3198
02:18:08,140 --> 02:18:13,640
Okay, let me like fucking make sure everything is the same.

3199
02:18:13,740 --> 02:18:14,460
Alright, here we go.

3200
02:18:14,560 --> 02:18:20,100
Just so you guys know, right here... here you go.

3201
02:18:20,180 --> 02:18:20,740
See that?

3202
02:18:21,180 --> 02:18:22,100
You see that?

3203
02:18:22,820 --> 02:18:25,840
That used to be like actually nothing.

3204
02:18:32,240 --> 02:18:33,280
That actually...

3205
02:18:33,280 --> 02:18:35,420
That used to be like nothing.

3206
02:18:35,660 --> 02:18:39,040
And then I was like, can it not be nothing?

3207
02:18:41,640 --> 02:18:49,160
I specifically... I specifically requested I want to go up like two letters at least.

3208
02:18:49,280 --> 02:18:50,680
At least two letters.

3209
02:18:52,120 --> 02:18:52,660
So...

3210
02:18:54,180 --> 02:18:56,780
I swear, I will show you guys how...

3211
02:18:56,780 --> 02:18:57,980
No, actually I don't have the file.

3212
02:18:58,900 --> 02:19:00,720
You're so lucky I don't have the file.

3213
02:19:05,620 --> 02:19:08,440
You're so lucky I don't have the file.

3214
02:19:08,580 --> 02:19:08,920
You're so lucky I don't have the file.

3215
02:19:08,920 --> 02:19:10,400
I didn't like download it again.

3216
02:19:10,600 --> 02:19:10,640
I didn't like download it again.

3217
02:19:10,640 --> 02:19:12,520
But there was a bump!

3218
02:19:12,960 --> 02:19:15,320
There is a bump now!

3219
02:19:15,900 --> 02:19:18,060
Anyway, anyway, here's the...

3220
02:19:18,060 --> 02:19:20,840
Whoa, let me grab the reference sheet.

3221
02:19:21,000 --> 02:19:21,840
It's pretty...

3222
02:19:21,840 --> 02:19:23,760
It's pretty big here.

3223
02:19:23,840 --> 02:19:24,540
Okay, let's see.

3224
02:19:24,680 --> 02:19:25,000
Whoa!

3225
02:19:25,540 --> 02:19:27,100
Okay, I need to like fix this.

3226
02:19:27,260 --> 02:19:28,400
Alright, so...

3227
02:19:29,140 --> 02:19:30,640
It's a big reference sheet too.

3228
02:19:31,300 --> 02:19:31,900
Um...

3229
02:19:33,280 --> 02:19:33,500
Yes.

3230
02:19:33,520 --> 02:19:35,920
Alright, so here is what it looks like.

3231
02:19:36,180 --> 02:19:36,740
Um...

3232
02:19:36,740 --> 02:19:38,760
I have this on Twitter as well.

3233
02:19:38,840 --> 02:19:39,900
So you guys can see everything.

3234
02:19:40,480 --> 02:19:42,760
So there's dad over there.

3235
02:19:42,980 --> 02:19:45,160
And then there's all my accessories and everything.

3236
02:19:45,320 --> 02:19:46,560
It's very bird themed.

3237
02:19:47,240 --> 02:19:47,800
Um...

3238
02:19:49,540 --> 02:19:50,100
Yes!

3239
02:19:50,100 --> 02:19:51,480
Medium is good too!

3240
02:19:52,700 --> 02:19:54,540
It could have been nothing!

3241
02:19:54,660 --> 02:19:56,260
But at least we got medium!

3242
02:19:57,440 --> 02:19:58,540
It's all natural.

3243
02:19:58,620 --> 02:19:59,140
Yeah.

3244
02:19:59,140 --> 02:19:59,160
Yeah.

3245
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:05,400
It's all natural.

3246
02:20:07,040 --> 02:20:07,600
Um...

3247
02:20:09,060 --> 02:20:09,620
Um...

3248
02:20:09,620 --> 02:20:12,180
You guys are watching too much anime.

3249
02:20:12,280 --> 02:20:13,340
You think that's not medium.

3250
02:20:15,360 --> 02:20:17,260
Look, we're not here with like...

3251
02:20:17,260 --> 02:20:19,240
Like helium balloons.

3252
02:20:19,440 --> 02:20:19,900
Okay?

3253
02:20:20,520 --> 02:20:21,980
It's not high school...

3254
02:20:21,980 --> 02:20:24,640
Was it the zombie fucking...

3255
02:20:24,640 --> 02:20:27,780
The one where like she dodges the bullet and the boobs flap.

3256
02:20:27,780 --> 02:20:29,440
And dodges the bullet.

3257
02:20:29,500 --> 02:20:30,200
That's not that.

3258
02:20:30,940 --> 02:20:31,500
Hahahaha!

3259
02:20:33,180 --> 02:20:33,740
Hahahaha!

3260
02:20:36,740 --> 02:20:37,300
Anyway...

3261
02:20:37,880 --> 02:20:38,440
Um...

3262
02:20:39,420 --> 02:20:40,120
Let's see.

3263
02:20:40,260 --> 02:20:42,460
Anyway, so here is the reference sheet for everything.

3264
02:20:42,920 --> 02:20:43,480
So...

3265
02:20:43,480 --> 02:20:45,380
I will post this on Twitter later.

3266
02:20:45,480 --> 02:20:46,380
If I'm not dead.

3267
02:20:46,960 --> 02:20:48,160
After the stream.

3268
02:20:49,220 --> 02:20:49,780
Hahahaha!

3269
02:20:51,320 --> 02:20:51,880
Um...

3270
02:20:52,760 --> 02:20:55,160
I think... Is that everything I want to talk about?

3271
02:20:55,160 --> 02:20:56,300
Before we do green screen?

3272
02:20:58,280 --> 02:20:58,760
Uhhhh...

3273
02:20:58,760 --> 02:21:00,040
I'm trying to remember.

3274
02:21:00,220 --> 02:21:02,160
I'm trying to remember...

3275
02:21:02,740 --> 02:21:04,580
If there's anything else...

3276
02:21:04,580 --> 02:21:07,420
I want to talk about before we go to...

3277
02:21:07,420 --> 02:21:08,980
Uh... green screen.

3278
02:21:10,120 --> 02:21:10,600
Uh...

3279
02:21:10,600 --> 02:21:12,320
I'll give you guys booba tomato!

3280
02:21:13,200 --> 02:21:15,520
This is the only jiggle fixes we're gonna get today.

3281
02:21:16,240 --> 02:21:16,720
Hahahaha!

3282
02:21:17,540 --> 02:21:17,980
Hahahaha!

3283
02:21:18,720 --> 02:21:20,840
I'll give you guys... I'm gonna give you guys...

3284
02:21:20,840 --> 02:21:22,140
Booba tomato soon.

3285
02:21:22,300 --> 02:21:22,740
Okay guys?

3286
02:21:22,800 --> 02:21:23,420
Give me a sec.

3287
02:21:23,620 --> 02:21:25,080
I need to remember how to fix it.

3288
02:21:25,160 --> 02:21:25,880
Because I... I...

3289
02:21:25,880 --> 02:21:27,960
I like... um...

3290
02:21:27,960 --> 02:21:29,360
Edit the physics.

3291
02:21:29,660 --> 02:21:32,620
So that... I took away the bone...

3292
02:21:32,620 --> 02:21:34,540
I took away the...

3293
02:21:35,920 --> 02:21:36,600
Um...

3294
02:21:37,140 --> 02:21:38,960
What do they put when they like...

3295
02:21:38,960 --> 02:21:41,400
Do like plastic surgery and they added more booba.

3296
02:21:41,540 --> 02:21:42,500
What's that called?

3297
02:21:43,780 --> 02:21:44,460
Implants?

3298
02:21:44,540 --> 02:21:46,620
I took away the implants that...

3299
02:21:46,620 --> 02:21:48,780
My doctor gave me.

3300
02:21:48,860 --> 02:21:50,660
That made me super jiggly.

3301
02:21:50,860 --> 02:21:51,540
Hahahaha!

3302
02:21:52,880 --> 02:21:53,560
Hahahaha!

3303
02:21:55,160 --> 02:21:56,000
I took away the implants.

3304
02:21:56,180 --> 02:21:58,320
So I'm not as jiggly anymore.

3305
02:21:58,800 --> 02:21:59,820
The silicone.

3306
02:21:59,940 --> 02:22:00,300
Yeah.

3307
02:22:00,940 --> 02:22:04,680
My plastic surgeon tried to give me silicone on my tomato.

3308
02:22:04,960 --> 02:22:06,020
On my true form.

3309
02:22:06,340 --> 02:22:08,060
And then I was like, oh maybe not.

3310
02:22:08,260 --> 02:22:11,900
And then I had the silicone removed from my tomato form.

3311
02:22:12,300 --> 02:22:12,860
Um...

3312
02:22:12,860 --> 02:22:13,500
Anyway.

There's like so many things too.

3316
02:22:20,380 --> 02:22:21,480
So it's like...

3317
02:22:21,480 --> 02:22:21,660
Ah!

3318
02:22:21,820 --> 02:22:23,140

02:22:29,040 --> 02:22:29,520
Hahahaha!

3323
02:22:30,360 --> 02:22:32,260

3324
02:22:32,520 --> 02:22:34,500
I don't know.

3325
02:22:35,580 --> 02:22:36,060
Um...

3326
02:22:36,800 --> 02:22:39,280
I need to like look at my settings real fast.

3327
02:22:39,480 --> 02:22:40,400
I need to look at my hotkeys.

3328
02:22:40,640 --> 02:22:41,880
What are my hotkeys?

3329
02:22:43,360 --> 02:22:43,840

02:22:57,980 --> 02:22:59,240
Why did I skip four?

3337
02:22:59,400 --> 02:23:00,580
I don't even have a four.

3338
02:23:00,900 --> 02:23:01,160
Okay.

3339
02:23:01,440 --> 02:23:02,000

Rice added that...

3373
02:24:08,090 --> 02:24:09,570
Added that themselves.

3374
02:24:09,690 --> 02:24:11,150
I didn't request for it.

3375
02:24:11,630 --> 02:24:12,310
Um...

3376
02:24:13,130 --> 02:24:14,830
Rice added it themselves.

3377
02:24:14,990 --> 02:24:16,330
So they like...

3378
02:24:16,330 --> 02:24:18,830
Stuffed some eye implants into me as well.

3379
02:24:19,010 --> 02:24:21,690
My plastic surgeon gave me some eye implants.

3380
02:24:22,350 --> 02:24:23,030
Um...

3381
02:24:23,030 --> 02:24:24,350
And then I think this one is my favorite.

3382
02:24:24,530 --> 02:24:25,210
This one is my favorite.

3383
02:24:26,330 --> 02:24:27,430
Now I'm gaming.

3384
02:24:28,710 --> 02:24:29,170

02:24:37,330 --> 02:24:39,910
I specifically asked for RGB.

3390
02:24:40,210 --> 02:24:41,090
I don't know how to make it stop!

3391
02:24:41,510 --> 02:24:42,630
How do I make it stop?

3392
02:24:43,050 --> 02:24:44,450
Oh okay I stopped it.

3393
02:24:44,710 --> 02:24:47,210
Okay I didn't know how to make it stop.

3395
02:24:48,330 --> 02:24:50,090

3396
02:24:50,190 --> 02:24:53,810

3403
02:25:02,790 --> 02:25:03,170
Arm.

3404
02:25:03,530 --> 02:25:04,750
No it's not arm.

3405
02:25:05,650 --> 02:25:07,070

I figured it out.

3445
02:26:09,870 --> 02:26:10,150
Okay.

3446
02:26:10,510 --> 02:26:11,650
I feel like...

3447
02:26:11,650 --> 02:26:12,690
Physics settings.

3448
02:26:12,970 --> 02:26:13,250
Okay.

3449
02:26:13,370 --> 02:26:14,470

3452
02:26:17,330 --> 02:26:17,830
Uh...

3453
02:26:19,170 --> 02:26:20,210
One... One...

3454
02:26:20,210 --> 02:26:21,330
Because I put it at zero.

3455
02:26:23,430 --> 02:26:24,470
One... One...

3456
02:26:24,470 --> 02:26:26,590
Uh... One...

3457
02:26:26,590 --> 02:26:27,290
Hahahaha!

3458
02:26:27,510 --> 02:26:28,270
Oh my god!

3459
02:26:28,290 --> 02:26:29,110
I'm maxing it out!

3460
02:26:29,530 --> 02:26:30,570
Not maxing it out.

3461
02:26:30,590 --> 02:26:32,590
I'm putting it on default because I had to like...

3462
02:26:32,590 --> 02:26:34,150
I had to put it all at zero.

3463
02:26:34,270 --> 02:26:34,910
Okay guys.

3464
02:26:35,070 --> 02:26:35,750
Are you guys ready?

3465
02:26:36,570 --> 02:26:37,090
Hahahaha!

3466
02:26:42,380 --> 02:26:43,700
Oh my god!

3467
02:26:43,720 --> 02:26:44,100
Okay.

3468
02:26:44,560 --> 02:26:45,080
Okay.

3469
02:26:48,600 --> 02:26:49,120
Hahahaha!

3470
02:26:53,200 --> 02:26:53,720
Hahahaha!

3471
02:26:53,720 --> 02:26:54,300
Hahahaha!

3472
02:26:55,580 --> 02:26:56,380
Hahahaha!

02:26:56,800 --> 02:26:57,600
Hahahaha!

3474
02:26:58,540 --> 02:26:59,340
Hahahaha!

3475
02:27:00,260 --> 02:27:02,920
I put the silicone back in.

3476
02:27:03,480 --> 02:27:03,880
Hahahaha!

3477
02:27:05,360 --> 02:27:06,160
Hahahaha!

3478
02:27:09,540 --> 02:27:11,160
It's not that bad.

3479
02:27:11,260 --> 02:27:13,200
It's because I'm not moving as much.

3480
02:27:13,240 --> 02:27:14,440
Now you know why.

3481
02:27:14,780 --> 02:27:15,420
Hahahaha!

3482
02:27:17,020 --> 02:27:17,420
Hahahaha!

3483
02:27:18,940 --> 02:27:21,060
The tomato ate right.

3484
02:27:21,360 --> 02:27:22,080
Okay wait.

3485
02:27:22,080 --> 02:27:23,560
If I move like...

3486
02:27:24,080 --> 02:27:24,440
Harder...

3487
02:27:24,440 --> 02:27:26,040
You guys will see it.

3488
02:27:27,360 --> 02:27:27,840
Hahahaha!

3489
02:27:27,840 --> 02:27:28,600
Okay no.

3490
02:27:28,780 --> 02:27:29,220
It's because...

3491
02:27:29,220 --> 02:27:29,420
Okay.

3492
02:27:29,540 --> 02:27:31,220
It's because like I turned it like...

3493
02:27:31,220 --> 02:27:32,220
A bit down.

3494
02:27:32,360 --> 02:27:33,120
You guys want to see it...

3495
02:27:33,120 --> 02:27:33,400
Okay.

3496
02:27:33,440 --> 02:27:34,820
You guys want to see the original physics?

3497
02:27:35,100 --> 02:27:35,900
Oh don't worry.

3498
02:27:36,000 --> 02:27:37,240
I'll show you guys the original physics.

3499
02:27:38,100 --> 02:27:39,520
Now you'll know why.

3500
02:27:39,720 --> 02:27:40,460
This was...

3501
02:27:40,940 --> 02:27:41,420
Guys.

3502
02:27:41,520 --> 02:27:42,600
This was the original.

3503
02:27:46,630 --> 02:27:47,110
Hahahaha!

3504
02:27:48,790 --> 02:27:49,270
Hahahaha!

3505
02:27:50,770 --> 02:27:52,050
I toned it down.

3506
02:27:52,050 --> 02:27:54,450
Now this was the original settings.

3507
02:27:55,090 --> 02:27:55,850
Hahahaha!

3508
02:27:56,350 --> 02:27:57,110
Hahahaha!

3509
02:27:57,950 --> 02:28:01,010
This tomato is not doing so well.

3510
02:28:01,490 --> 02:28:02,250
Guys.

3511
02:28:02,590 --> 02:28:04,530
Plastic surgery was a mistake.

3512
02:28:05,270 --> 02:28:05,970
Hahahaha!

3513
02:28:07,150 --> 02:28:07,910
Hahahaha!

3514
02:28:08,670 --> 02:28:11,850
At least somebody is getting some jiggles.

3515
02:28:12,230 --> 02:28:12,990
Hahahaha!

3516
02:28:13,790 --> 02:28:14,170
Hahahaha!

3517
02:28:14,670 --> 02:28:15,430
Okay.

3518
02:28:16,250 --> 02:28:17,010
Um.

3519
02:28:17,130 --> 02:28:18,710
Now make it RGB.

3520
02:28:18,870 --> 02:28:19,730
You're right.

3521
02:28:20,710 --> 02:28:21,470
Hahahaha!

3522
02:28:25,050 --> 02:28:25,650
Wow!

3523
02:28:28,230 --> 02:28:28,830
Wow!

3524
02:28:29,990 --> 02:28:31,650
Take your meds!

3525
02:28:31,710 --> 02:28:33,290
Take your meds!

3526
02:28:35,380 --> 02:28:35,980
Hahahaha!

3527
02:28:37,000 --> 02:28:37,600
Okay.

3528
02:28:38,100 --> 02:28:38,700
Anyway.

3529
02:28:39,020 --> 02:28:40,520
I gotta fucking fix myself.

3530
02:28:40,780 --> 02:28:41,180
I gotta.

3531
02:28:41,980 --> 02:28:42,580
Um.

3532
02:28:42,820 --> 02:28:44,640
Let me fix myself real fast.

3533
02:28:44,920 --> 02:28:46,660
But that was... That was the original.

3534
02:28:46,960 --> 02:28:48,660
I'll fix the... I'll fix myself later.

3535
02:28:49,200 --> 02:28:51,100
I'm too tired right now.

3536
02:28:51,140 --> 02:28:53,720
I wanna... I'm too tired to fix myself.

3537
02:28:54,160 --> 02:28:54,760
Um.

3538
02:28:54,760 --> 02:28:55,360
Um.

3539
02:28:57,080 --> 02:28:57,560
Okay.

3540
02:28:58,500 --> 02:28:59,980
Now we're back here.

3541
02:29:00,140 --> 02:29:00,620
Alright.

3542
02:29:00,680 --> 02:29:02,380
I put back my skin suit back on.

3543
02:29:03,580 --> 02:29:04,500
Veggie tails!

3544
02:29:06,200 --> 02:29:07,160
Veggie tails!

3545
02:29:08,500 --> 02:29:09,240
Veggie tails!

3546
02:29:09,440 --> 02:29:09,580
Alright.

3547
02:29:09,780 --> 02:29:10,240
So.

3548
02:29:10,540 --> 02:29:11,260
Screenshot time!

3549
02:29:11,460 --> 02:29:12,100
Screenshot time!

3550
02:29:12,420 --> 02:29:12,900
So.

3551
02:29:13,020 --> 02:29:14,900
Like I said I can do...

3552
02:29:16,880 --> 02:29:17,360
Hahahaha!

3553
02:29:17,940 --> 02:29:20,080
I think this is my... This one is my favorite.

3554
02:29:22,480 --> 02:29:23,440
And also...

3555
02:29:23,440 --> 02:29:23,640
Hmm.

3556
02:29:25,860 --> 02:29:27,120
The lip bite.

3557
02:29:28,200 --> 02:29:28,680
Hahahaha!

3558
02:29:29,100 --> 02:29:30,560
That one's also my favorite.

3559
02:29:30,600 --> 02:29:33,820
It's so hard to give you a screenshot cause there's so many expressions I can make now.

3560
02:29:34,040 --> 02:29:35,040
Like take your camera.

3561
02:29:36,420 --> 02:29:37,740
And there's this one.

3562
02:29:39,500 --> 02:29:40,660
I love that one too.

3563
02:29:40,740 --> 02:29:42,000
That one's my favorite expression too.

3564
02:29:44,160 --> 02:29:44,640
Hahahaha!

3565
02:29:46,300 --> 02:29:46,780
Hahahaha!

3566
02:29:47,260 --> 02:29:47,700
Um.

3567
02:29:48,080 --> 02:29:48,920
And then...

3568
02:29:50,000 --> 02:29:50,480
Hmm.

3569
02:29:52,640 --> 02:29:53,160
Hahahaha!

3570
02:29:54,040 --> 02:29:54,560
Um.

3571
02:29:56,240 --> 02:29:56,760
Um.

3572
02:29:56,760 --> 02:29:58,540
Try to think of other stuff I can do.

3573
02:29:58,700 --> 02:29:59,640
I can do so much.

3574
02:29:59,640 --> 02:30:00,260
I can do like...

3575
02:30:00,260 --> 02:30:00,400
Hmm.

3576
02:30:02,080 --> 02:30:02,600
And...

3577
02:30:03,660 --> 02:30:04,180
Hahahaha!

3578
02:30:05,100 --> 02:30:05,620
Um.

3579
02:30:05,740 --> 02:30:07,340
And then obviously there's the...

3580
02:30:07,340 --> 02:30:08,400
There's dad.

3581
02:30:09,000 --> 02:30:10,220
Dad's above me here.

3582
02:30:11,040 --> 02:30:11,560
Yay!

3583
02:30:12,480 --> 02:30:13,000
Woo!

3584
02:30:13,860 --> 02:30:15,240
There's dad right here.

3585
02:30:15,780 --> 02:30:17,540
If you just want screenshots of dad.

3586
02:30:17,800 --> 02:30:18,520
Here he is.

3587
02:30:21,320 --> 02:30:22,780
He's just chilling.

3588
02:30:23,800 --> 02:30:24,620
He's just...

3589
02:30:24,620 --> 02:30:26,220
He's just having a good time.

3590
02:30:26,580 --> 02:30:27,120
Hahahaha!

3591
02:30:28,120 --> 02:30:28,680
Yeah!

3592
02:30:28,940 --> 02:30:29,900
There he is.

3593
02:30:30,260 --> 02:30:30,960
Mm-hmm.

3594
02:30:31,420 --> 02:30:32,160
Mm-hmm.

3595
02:30:32,500 --> 02:30:33,940
And then there he goes.

3596
02:30:34,380 --> 02:30:35,820
And then there's...

3597
02:30:39,800 --> 02:30:40,360
Dragons?

3598
02:30:40,820 --> 02:30:42,340
Did you guys like the debut?

3599
02:30:43,760 --> 02:30:44,980
Did you guys like it?

3600
02:30:45,620 --> 02:30:46,180
Hahahaha!

3601
02:30:47,500 --> 02:30:48,060
Hahahaha!

3602
02:30:48,300 --> 02:30:50,020
And then there's the one with tears.

3603
02:30:50,560 --> 02:30:51,660
Did you guys like it?

3604
02:30:53,000 --> 02:30:53,240
Really?

3605
02:30:54,700 --> 02:30:55,640
Really guys?

3606
02:30:56,300 --> 02:30:56,860
Again?

3607
02:30:57,940 --> 02:30:58,760
Oh my god.

3608
02:30:58,800 --> 02:30:59,480
You guys liked it?

3609
02:31:00,600 --> 02:31:01,160
And...

02:31:01,880 --> 02:31:04,480
Also, oh I can... the red eye... the aimbot.

3611
02:31:05,780 --> 02:31:06,500
Aimbot's on.

3612
02:31:06,960 --> 02:31:07,760
Legal aimbot.

3613
02:31:07,820 --> 02:31:08,000
Sorry.

3614
02:31:08,360 --> 02:31:10,080
Legal aimbot on.

3615
02:31:10,340 --> 02:31:12,980
So please don't report me because it's biologically on me.

3616
02:31:13,300 --> 02:31:15,020
There's no Clara shit here.

3617
02:31:15,340 --> 02:31:17,360
It's legal aimbot.

3618
02:31:17,900 --> 02:31:18,460
Hahahaha!

3619
02:31:20,000 --> 02:31:20,560
Uh...

3620
02:31:20,560 --> 02:31:22,440
And... oh wait.

3621
02:31:23,000 --> 02:31:24,200
Uh...

3622
02:31:26,280 --> 02:31:27,200
Numbers?

3623
02:31:27,380 --> 02:31:27,840
Math?

3624
02:31:28,560 --> 02:31:29,280
Where am I?

3625
02:31:29,480 --> 02:31:30,260
Which left?

3626
02:31:30,540 --> 02:31:31,340
Which north?

3627
02:31:34,680 --> 02:31:35,600
Hahahaha!

3628
02:31:38,660 --> 02:31:40,060
Uh... and then...

3629
02:31:40,060 --> 02:31:40,240
Woo!

3630
02:31:41,060 --> 02:31:41,840
Oh!

3631
02:31:42,300 --> 02:31:46,380

We're going so fast!

3638
02:31:58,060 --> 02:31:59,300
It's like modeling, you know?

3639
02:31:59,380 --> 02:32:03,460
Like modeling you're supposed to make like 10 poses per minute or something.

3640
02:32:03,660 --> 02:32:04,220
Cause it's like...

3641
02:32:04,220 --> 02:32:08,460
I hope you guys are taking very fast screenshots cause I have so many expressions.

3642
02:32:09,040 --> 02:32:10,260
I'm not used to it.

3643
02:32:10,340 --> 02:32:12,460
I'm not used to having so many expressions.

3644
02:32:12,680 --> 02:32:14,720
That like I have to go by so fast.

3645
02:32:15,920 --> 02:32:16,720
And then...

3646
02:32:18,340 --> 02:32:18,740
Um...

3647
02:32:18,740 --> 02:32:20,220
Oh my god.

3648
02:32:22,160 --> 02:32:22,620
What's that?

3649
02:32:22,780 --> 02:32:23,400
Did you guys hear that?

3650
02:32:24,400 --> 02:32:25,440
Guys I'm gonna like...

3651
02:32:25,440 --> 02:32:27,120

02:32:27,600 --> 02:32:28,080
Hahahaha!

3653
02:32:29,280 --> 02:32:29,760

This is my favorite.

3657
02:32:35,680 --> 02:32:39,100
You see the hair physics a lot better too.

3658
02:32:39,360 --> 02:32:39,840
Hahahaha!

3659
02:32:41,320 --> 02:32:41,800
Hahahaha!

3660
02:32:42,620 --> 02:32:44,160
I can fight you with my ne...

02:32:44,160 --> 02:32:45,440
Oh it's like those giraffe fights!

3662

Okay you know like giraffes that's how they fight?

3663
02:32:47,940 --> 02:32:50,700
They swing their necks at each other and be like...

02:32:50,700 --> 02:32:50,960
Uh!

3665
02:32:51,940 --> 02:32:52,420

That's how they fight!

3668
02:32:56,080 --> 02:32:56,980
That is how they fight!

3669
02:32:57,480 --> 02:32:59,680
And then normal sparkle and be like...

3670
02:33:02,730 --> 02:33:03,950
Wait for me?

3671
02:33:06,310 --> 02:33:07,510
And then...

3672
02:33:07,510 --> 02:33:08,770
Oh yeah jacket off.

3673
02:33:09,070 --> 02:33:10,750

Oh yeah and then you see like you know...

3677
02:33:16,230 --> 02:33:17,690
The jacket comes...

3678
02:33:18,330 --> 02:33:18,930

3679
02:33:20,430 --> 02:33:21,030
And...

My nerves!

3848
02:38:38,720 --> 02:38:41,020

3850
02:38:41,660 --> 02:38:43,280

02:38:46,520 --> 02:38:48,520
Redebuting all... I mean technically it is...

3853
02:38:48,520 --> 02:38:48,920

3870
02:39:18,140 --> 02:39:19,060

3872
02:39:21,180 --> 02:39:22,940
One of the most stressful projects we've ever done.

3873
02:39:23,160 --> 02:39:23,540
Hahaha!

3874
02:39:24,880 --> 02:39:26,460
Because it was incredibly ambitious!

3875
02:39:26,840 --> 02:39:29,500
I've never been able to do something this ambitious before.

3876
02:39:29,600 --> 02:39:31,480
When it comes to like producing it.

3877
02:39:31,960 --> 02:39:32,440
And...

3878
02:39:32,440 --> 02:39:33,540
Like I said...

3879
02:39:33,540 --> 02:39:35,240
It's because of your support guys.

3880
02:39:35,580 --> 02:39:37,740
That I was able to do something like this.

3881
02:39:38,160 --> 02:39:39,900
Be able to plan something like this.

3882
02:39:39,960 --> 02:39:41,300
And afford to do something like this.

3883
02:39:41,360 --> 02:39:44,260
So thank you Dragoons for your support.

3884
02:39:44,480 --> 02:39:45,680
And being able to...

3885
02:39:46,240 --> 02:39:47,300
Help me fund...

3886
02:39:47,300 --> 02:39:49,760
This passion project that I did.

3887
02:39:51,300 --> 02:39:51,820
And...

3888
02:39:51,820 --> 02:39:53,860
Yeah but please check out my new merch.

3889
02:39:55,060 --> 02:39:55,580
From...

3890
02:39:57,060 --> 02:39:58,160
From my mama.

3891
02:39:58,340 --> 02:39:59,200
That they did.

3892
02:39:59,200 --> 02:40:00,320
My new acrylic stand.

3893
02:40:01,360 --> 02:40:04,020
That you can pre-order now.

3894
02:40:05,180 --> 02:40:07,000
I love the visual art.

3895
02:40:07,140 --> 02:40:08,120
This is going to be my new...

3896
02:40:08,120 --> 02:40:09,420
Key visuals now.

3897
02:40:09,760 --> 02:40:11,760
So I'm going to be using this for like...

3898
02:40:11,760 --> 02:40:13,820
If I'm guesting at any places or something.

3899
02:40:14,220 --> 02:40:15,620
And they need a key visual.

3900
02:40:15,800 --> 02:40:18,020
I'll definitely be using this as the main art.

3901
02:40:18,580 --> 02:40:19,780
For stuff like that.

3902
02:40:20,040 --> 02:40:22,020
Because I always wanted a key visual art.

3903
02:40:22,500 --> 02:40:23,020
Um...

3904
02:40:23,860 --> 02:40:24,900
And yes.

3905
02:40:25,040 --> 02:40:28,060
I couldn't have done it without all of you guys.

3906
02:40:28,160 --> 02:40:29,180
I couldn't have done it without you guys.

3907
02:40:29,200 --> 02:40:30,440
Because I have been able to...

3908
02:40:31,320 --> 02:40:32,100
You know...

3909
02:40:32,100 --> 02:40:33,820
Be able to afford to do stuff like this.

3910
02:40:34,060 --> 02:40:35,780
And be able to...

3911
02:40:37,080 --> 02:40:38,940
Be able to you know...

3912
02:40:39,680 --> 02:40:41,300
Do these passion projects.

3913
02:40:41,700 --> 02:40:42,220
And...

3914
02:40:42,940 --> 02:40:44,980
Be able to entertain you guys.

3915
02:40:45,160 --> 02:40:46,580
And have fun with all of you.

3916
02:40:46,720 --> 02:40:48,200
So thank you Dragoons!

3917
02:40:48,220 --> 02:40:50,960
Thank you all for the super chats.

3918
02:40:51,180 --> 02:40:52,200
Thank you all for the...

3919
02:40:53,160 --> 02:40:55,300
For the memberships.

3920
02:40:55,700 --> 02:40:57,120
Joining the tomato farm.

3921
02:40:57,300 --> 02:40:58,260
And supporting me!

3922
02:40:59,200 --> 02:41:00,440
I hope this...

3923
02:41:00,440 --> 02:41:03,340
I hope this new rebrand...

3924
02:41:03,340 --> 02:41:04,980
Was worth it for you guys!

3925
02:41:05,340 --> 02:41:06,360
Because I know...

3926
02:41:06,360 --> 02:41:09,540
It's very different from Retro Doki.

3927
02:41:09,880 --> 02:41:11,000
And I...

3928
02:41:11,000 --> 02:41:12,380
I just really wanted to...

3929
02:41:13,060 --> 02:41:13,740
Merge...

3930
02:41:13,740 --> 02:41:16,480
Past and present together.

3931
02:41:17,560 --> 02:41:19,460
Into something that I felt...

3932
02:41:19,460 --> 02:41:20,600
Was more like me.

3933
02:41:20,860 --> 02:41:23,420
And I'm so happy to be able to...

3934
02:41:23,420 --> 02:41:25,060
Work with my mama.

3935
02:41:25,240 --> 02:41:26,540
To do all of that.

3936
02:41:26,540 --> 02:41:27,340
And...

3937
02:41:28,060 --> 02:41:29,920
And yeah I was really surprised.

3938
02:41:30,340 --> 02:41:31,520
I remember sending that email.

3939
02:41:31,600 --> 02:41:31,940
I was like...

3940
02:41:31,940 --> 02:41:33,660
Are you open too?

3941
02:41:33,860 --> 02:41:34,600
And they were like yes!

3942
02:41:35,260 --> 02:41:36,460
And I was so happy.

3943
02:41:36,840 --> 02:41:39,460
And we worked very hard together.

3944
02:41:39,540 --> 02:41:40,240
With Clea.

3945
02:41:40,720 --> 02:41:42,040
And Celia.

3946
02:41:42,060 --> 02:41:44,080
Celia actually gave input as well.

3947
02:41:45,540 --> 02:41:47,780
Gave input as well when it came to this design.

3948
02:41:47,940 --> 02:41:49,540
And also my artist friends like Poki.

3949
02:41:49,940 --> 02:41:52,600
And Poki and Gigi.

3950
02:41:52,740 --> 02:41:54,220
Who helped me a lot.

3951
02:41:57,240 --> 02:41:58,320
I actually...

3952
02:41:58,320 --> 02:42:00,460
Leaked the model to them and asked...

3953
02:42:00,460 --> 02:42:01,740
Their advice as well.

3954
02:42:02,840 --> 02:42:03,920
Regarding like...

3955
02:42:04,820 --> 02:42:06,460
Regarding like what to do.

3956
02:42:06,580 --> 02:42:07,120
And stuff.

3957
02:42:07,760 --> 02:42:08,300
And...

3958
02:42:10,000 --> 02:42:11,320
Lots of work!

3959
02:42:11,400 --> 02:42:12,360
I was so scared.

3960
02:42:12,640 --> 02:42:13,360
I was so nervous.

3961
02:42:13,500 --> 02:42:14,120
I was so anxious.

3962
02:42:14,440 --> 02:42:15,260
But it's over!

3963
02:42:17,020 --> 02:42:18,240
It's over now!

3964
02:42:18,360 --> 02:42:20,320
We ripped the bandaid off.

3965
02:42:20,500 --> 02:42:21,580
And this is what I look like now!

3966
02:42:21,940 --> 02:42:22,240
Yay!

3967
02:42:24,900 --> 02:42:25,440
Yes!

3968
02:42:26,540 --> 02:42:28,260
I think that's really...

3969
02:42:28,260 --> 02:42:30,260
All I really want to say.

3970
02:42:30,740 --> 02:42:33,000
I hope you guys had a...

3971
02:42:33,680 --> 02:42:35,100
Great time today.

3972
02:42:36,000 --> 02:42:37,140
Great time watching.

3973
02:42:37,340 --> 02:42:38,460
And had a lot of fun.

3974
02:42:39,080 --> 02:42:40,940
I'll see you guys next time everybody.

3975
02:42:41,300 --> 02:42:42,120
As always everyone.

3976
02:42:42,380 --> 02:42:43,300
Stay hydrated.

3977
02:42:44,060 --> 02:42:44,800
Posture check.

3978
02:42:44,940 --> 02:42:46,820
Get up and around to get that blood flowing.

3979
02:42:47,000 --> 02:42:48,300
And if you stay up for me.

3980
02:42:48,480 --> 02:42:49,340
Head to bed.

3981
02:42:49,560 --> 02:42:50,960
Because you deserve it!

3982
02:42:50,960 --> 02:42:52,340
Oh yes!

3983
02:42:52,540 --> 02:42:53,460
Before I forget.

3984
02:42:54,000 --> 02:42:55,740
I will be a guest.

3985
02:42:56,200 --> 02:42:58,460
At Yu Sun's tour.

3986
02:42:59,000 --> 02:43:00,380
In Hong Kong.

3987
02:43:00,640 --> 02:43:01,040
Yes.

3988
02:43:01,120 --> 02:43:01,800
I think I'm singing.

3989
02:43:02,020 --> 02:43:02,420
I think.

3990
02:43:03,600 --> 02:43:05,200
I should know by now.

3991
02:43:06,020 --> 02:43:06,900
It's in August.

3992
02:43:09,620 --> 02:43:11,140
I think I'm...

3993
02:43:11,140 --> 02:43:12,080
I am singing.

3994
02:43:12,220 --> 02:43:12,480
Yes.

3995
02:43:13,760 --> 02:43:16,700
It would be pretty awkward if I wasn't.

3996
02:43:18,700 --> 02:43:18,980
Yes.

3997
02:43:19,020 --> 02:43:19,540
I'll be...

3998
02:43:20,960 --> 02:43:23,360
I'll also be at AVCon in Adelaide.

3999
02:43:23,440 --> 02:43:25,180
And I'll be as...

4000
02:43:25,180 --> 02:43:26,760
Bounty Hunter Doki.

4001
02:43:27,020 --> 02:43:28,900
So I'll be Bounty Hunter Doki.

4002
02:43:28,960 --> 02:43:30,500
At all my future conventions.

4003
02:43:30,600 --> 02:43:31,700
Unless there's like...

4004
02:43:31,700 --> 02:43:33,720
I feel a little quirky.

4005
02:43:33,860 --> 02:43:36,020
And I swap between things.

4006
02:43:36,420 --> 02:43:37,100
But we'll see.

4007
02:43:38,300 --> 02:43:40,700
AVCon will be the first time I'll be using Bounty Hunter Doki.

4008
02:43:41,180 --> 02:43:41,900
But yes!

4009
02:43:42,100 --> 02:43:42,960
I'll see you guys Tuesday.

4010
02:43:44,640 --> 02:43:45,540
For behind the scenes.

4011
02:43:45,980 --> 02:43:47,400
Bye everybody!

4012
02:43:48,420 --> 02:43:48,940
Bye!

4013
02:43:50,960 --> 02:43:51,140
Bye!
