1
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,020
Hello, hello everybody!

2
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:52,580
Yes, I am very echo-y.

3
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:56,120
Holy shit, I'm so echo-y.

4
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:00,040
It's not like there's nothing here.

5
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:02,520
There's so many stuff in my room right now.

6
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:09,140
Okay, it's cause it's- yes, this is my very first stream at my new apartment.

7
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:11,080
So like, I don't know what to do.

8
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,120
It's echo-y.

9
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,040
I'm a mess right now.

10
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,860
To be fair, I've been a mess for a while.

11
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:26,900
Oh my gosh, I finally set up my entire, like, desk and PC and everything.

12
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:32,600
So like, yes, there's no windows in here, but there is a glass door.

13
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:35,220
It's like a glass sliding door.

14
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:41,840
And, oh my god, you're right, I should- What will happen if I just, like, pour all the plushies out?

15
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:44,000
And- Sorry!

16
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,980
I found out- Why- I don't fucking know why I ran.

17
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:58,880
So, I found out I have, like, five plus boxes of just plushies that I've collected over seven years.

18
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:04,540
So, like, I was like, I'm gonna just grab a bunch of plushies and I just pour everything out.

19
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,640
And, like, they're not, like, small boxes, too.

20
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:09,180
They're, like, those- the biggest moving boxes you can have.

21
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:13,780
So, like, cause, like, there was, like, some tape boxes that was, like, seven plus years old.

22
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:15,380
And I was like, what the fuck are these?

23
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:16,460
And then I, like, pick it up.

24
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,660
It's, like, super light and I open it.

25
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:21,480
It's, like, it's, like, there's, like, five plus boxes of just plushies.

26
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:24,140
So- Oh, everything feels so weird.

27
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,480
Ah, I hate it!

28
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:36,120
Okay, so, like, you know, like, um, I really hate it when, um- Also, like, if Sound Guy is here- Sound Guy, I need you to double check if there's any crackling or anything.

29
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:44,320
Because I- I- I bought, like, a hundred plus dollars worth of cable management stuff because I had no- I've never had cable management before.

30
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:47,840
So I bought, like- I bought, like, wire holders.

31
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:50,480
I bought, like, those Velcro things.

32
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,460
I bought, like, wire- like, cable sleeve holders.

33
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:58,960
And then I bought, like, uh- I bought two Velcro holders.

34
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:00,640
And- I

35
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:08,070
- And then I bought, like, cable labels.

36
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:09,550
Like, Velcro labels.

37
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:12,150
So I- Like, color-coded Velcro labels.

38
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:16,110
I've never- I've never had cable management before.

39
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:17,730
And I was, like, okay.

40
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:26,210
Now that I am doing the- the- the desk stuff, I guess I shall invest on a hundred dollars worth of cable management stuff.

41
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:38,470
Um- So- And then- Um- Yes, I have reverb because I just moved.

42
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:41,350
And- And I just fully moved.

43
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:46,390
Um- And, like- It's not like this is an empty- That's the worst part.

44
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:50,190
It's not like this is, like, an empty- It's okay, it's Canadian money.

45
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:52,270
A hundred dollars worth of Canadian money.

46
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:54,850
So, like, that's, like, fifty dollars for you.

47
00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:02,150
So- Hor hor hor hor hor hor hor hor hor hor.

48
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:05,250
JT, thank you for the superchat.

49
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:06,090
Thank you, thank you.

50
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:08,010
Does the hor hor travel in the echo?

51
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:10,530
Okay, so, like- I don't know.

52
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:18,550
Should I just grab a box of plushies and just- Like- Just- Just, like- Uh- Just chuck it on the floor?

53
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:20,270
Like, would that help?

54
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:22,990
Would that- Wait- Would that actually help?

55
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:24,290
I don't know.

56
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:25,570
I've never done- Oh my god.

57
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:26,570
Everything feels so weird.

58
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:32,550
Because I hate it when, like- Um- I hate it when- Uh- When- Okay.

59
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:36,190
Okay, I'm gonna grab a box of plushies and then just- Just throw it on the floor.

60
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:37,990
And then just see what happens.

61
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:39,970
Um- Put them in the corner?

62
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:41,410
In the corner?

63
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:43,190
But where will I walk?

64
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:48,410
Where will I- I don't even put them in corners?

65
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:51,370
Like, I can only put in two corners.

66
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:52,650
Okay.

67
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:55,930
Um- Because like, everything feels off.

68
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:56,270
You know?

69
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:58,630
Like, how the monitors feel off and everything.

70
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:01,890
And I'm like- How do I- How do I look at my second monitor?

71
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:03,630
I have a mic stand right here.

72
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:05,250
How did I do that?

73
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:07,470
I'm just like- Oh my god.

74
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:09,510
My mic stand is like- Here.

75
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:15,590
How was I able to look at- How was I able to- How was I able to like- Look at my second monitor?

76
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:18,370
I- I don't know.

77
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:21,650
I can't- Alright.

78
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:24,830
Guys, I'm gonna grab my box of plushies.

79
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:26,350
I'm just gonna chuck it on the floor.

80
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:27,410
I'll be right back, guys.

81
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:29,310
Guys, we're doing it all live.

82
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:32,410
Alright, you can hear my sliding door.

83
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:33,690
My sliding glass door.

84
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:34,590
See, guys?

85
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:35,510
Can you still hear me?

86
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:37,970
I'm grabbing my plushies.

87
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:40,230
Box of plushies.

88
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:50,590
I found it, everybody.

89
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:51,810
I found it.

90
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:52,370
We traveled.

91
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:54,070
It was in my room.

92
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:55,730
I found box number one.

93
00:07:56,530 --> 00:07:58,370
And they're all like, in garbage bags.

94
00:07:58,770 --> 00:07:59,270
Okay.

95
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:02,570
Gonna chuck some plushies in the corner.

96
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:06,730
I just hope that doesn't get in here.

97
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:09,350
Did the acoustic- Did it help?

98
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:11,730
Did it- Oh my god.

99
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:14,130
Packing this up is gonna be a pain.

100
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:19,350
I don't want- Oh.

101
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:21,610
I don't wanna pick this up.

102
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:21,810
Oh.

103
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:23,350
I got it.

104
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:24,190
Did it help?

105
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:26,270
Did it actually help?

106
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:28,110
I can't tell.

107
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:30,550
Did it actually absorb it?

108
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:31,530
Oh my god.

109
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:32,750
I'm doing it.

110
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:33,210
Okay.

111
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:34,370
All right.

112
00:08:34,410 --> 00:08:37,470
I have it on my back corner.

113
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:38,830
But how much?

114
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:39,510
Do I put more?

115
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:41,350
Wait, it actually did?

116
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:43,530
My plushies actually absorbed it?

117
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:45,190
I'm going to put it on the other corner.

118
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:46,270
All right.

119
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:48,470
God, I don't want to fucking clean this.

120
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:51,290
All right.

121
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:52,790
I can grab more.

122
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:54,150
All right.

123
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:55,550
Is it better?

124
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:57,550
Should I bring more plushies?

125
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:03,230
Guys, hold it like a whopping five or six.

126
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:08,450
Wait, does it actually?

127
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:10,810
Wait, I was looking around.

128
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:14,010
Wait, it's actually better.

129
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:17,810
My noise-canceling plushies.

130
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:18,850
Okay.

131
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:20,870
I have it in two corners.

132
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:27,310
I can put it on the third corner, but I can't put it on the fourth corner because the fourth corner is where all my PC stuff is.

133
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:29,410
So, like, I'm going to bring it back.

134
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:30,390
I'm bringing the third.

135
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,570
I'm bringing two more garbage bags of plushies.

136
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:34,130
I'll be right back.

137
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:35,710
I need to make sure dad doesn't get in here.

138
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:53,930
I'm back.

139
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:56,490
I'm back with more plushies.

140
00:09:57,330 --> 00:10:01,030
Okay, I'm going to stuff this corner with more plushies.

141
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:02,190
I'm going to stuff this corner.

142
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:03,070
Okay.

143
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:04,590
All right.

144
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:06,650
Ooh, that's a lot of plushies.

145
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:10,650
My god, it's like Pokemon and, like, Baymax.

146
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:11,670
Okay.

147
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:12,970
There it is.

148
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:14,710
I'm going to take a picture of this.

149
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:16,630
I'll take a picture of this right now, actually.

150
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:20,010
Just let you see, like, the corner of plushies.

151
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:25,130
Then one giant Snorlax plushie gets to have this one corner all by himself.

152
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:26,450
All right.

153
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:28,010
The adventures.

154
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:31,390
Okay, here we go.

155
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:32,250
All right.

156
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:34,130
I'll take a picture, too.

157
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:35,230
Okay.

158
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:39,570
I am not looking forward to cleaning this right after.

159
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:40,330
All right.

160
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:42,930
I'm not going to be moving because I...

161
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:51,090
You can see a picture of dad just looking at it and being like, I don't want to do it.

162
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:55,270
Okay.

163
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:58,510
Okay.

164
00:10:58,890 --> 00:10:59,410
Okay.

165
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:00,890
Okay.

166
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:01,450
Okay.

167
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:02,550
Okay.

168
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:04,050
Just looking at it.

169
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:04,990
All right.

170
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:05,990
Okay.

171
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:06,830
Let's see.

172
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:10,890
I'm making sure there's no reflection of anything.

173
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:11,590
All right.

174
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:14,850
Let me send this to myself.

175
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:20,870
By the way, I just realized why you guys were right.

176
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:26,990
I should not put my PC in a room with no windows.

177
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:32,210
I need a bike.

178
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:34,550
I need to buy an air conditioner in here.

179
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:37,650
I need to buy a portable air conditioner.

180
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:42,910
Oh, God, it's so hot in here.

181
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:44,710
It's so hot.

182
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:46,670
Okay.

183
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:47,790
Okay.

184
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:48,470
All right.

185
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:50,790
Let me show you what I did.

186
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:51,890
All right.

187
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:53,170
Let's see.

188
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:54,970
All right.

189
00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:56,370
Let's see.

190
00:11:56,570 --> 00:11:57,330
Is it better?

191
00:11:57,410 --> 00:11:58,310
I can't tell.

192
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:02,250
I legitimately can't tell if it's better or not.

193
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:04,630
Alright, here we go.

194
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:05,950
This is...

195
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:09,730
This is what it looks like.

196
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:15,110
So, in this corner, I have a...

197
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:17,370
I have a...

198
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:20,090
Dad's just looking in.

199
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:25,910
Dad's just...

200
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:27,650
Dad's just looking in.

201
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:30,110
I have a bunch of plushies in the corner.

202
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:32,490
Let him...

203
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:32,650
No!

204
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:34,390
He's gonna fucking rip it apart!

205
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:35,850
What do you mean?

206
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:40,910
So...

207
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:44,590
I should buy those foam soundproof things.

208
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:47,030
I've never had to buy one of those before.

209
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:49,110
But I feel like I'll need them.

210
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:49,750
But I feel like I'll need them.

211
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:52,210
He looks so confused.

212
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:53,190
He's like, let me in!

213
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:54,150
Let me in!

214
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:57,490
But yes, here we go.

215
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:59,350
Now, you see...

216
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:00,910
You see...

217
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:04,170
Dad in the corner looking in and being like...

218
00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:04,650
What the fuck?

219
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,010
Let me in!

220
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:07,030
Let me in!

221
00:13:08,210 --> 00:13:09,170
So, did it help?

222
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:10,890
Did it help the echo?

223
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:14,410
Did it help?

224
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:17,310
I am not looking forward to cleaning all of this up later.

225
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:21,230
Why do you have a Wii U?

226
00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:22,570
Because I've been unpacking!

227
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:24,210
Okay, funny story.

228
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:27,690
Funny story, but...

229
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:29,130
So...

230
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:32,010
I had my last move.

231
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:34,190
For my PC stuff.

232
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:39,730
By the way, I'm so glad I moved because I hated that place I used to live.

233
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:40,150
Like...

234
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:44,310
I hated that place because the elevators were always broken.

235
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:47,050
And there was not a lot of elevators.

236
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:49,370
There were not a lot of elevators.

237
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:52,530
I'm using plushies as soundproof right now.

238
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:53,530
And...

239
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:56,950
Because of that, the elevators were always broken.

240
00:13:56,950 --> 00:14:00,810
And usually, only one elevator would work.

241
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:02,750
And I fucking hated that place!

242
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:04,470
So I'm glad.

243
00:14:04,770 --> 00:14:06,350
I'm glad it's gone.

244
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:07,970
I don't live there anymore.

245
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:09,790
Anyway, so, funny story.

246
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:12,070
I recently had my final move.

247
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:13,630
A final move.

248
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:14,870
I won't say what day it was.

249
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:24,350
But like, I didn't pay for professional movers this time because I was like, okay, for the second time, I don't think I really need professional movers because I'm pretty sure I don't have a lot of stuff left.

250
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:26,190
And, um...

251
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:29,430
So I was like, oh, okay.

252
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:32,130
I'm going to...

253
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:35,890
I don't have any, like, guy friends that live in my city.

254
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:39,970
So I was asking around, like, mutual friends and stuff.

255
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:44,370
Being like, oh, do you guys have mutual friends that live here?

256
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:46,170
And then, there was one.

257
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:47,430
There was one guy friend.

258
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:49,390
Mutual guy friend.

259
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:50,470
I don't know who they are.

260
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:53,010
I literally met them for the move.

261
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:54,890
And it was so fun because...

262
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:58,990
So, they don't know what I do.

263
00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:01,970
They do not know what I do.

264
00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:03,810
And, um...

265
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:07,370
My friend told this guy, they're like, oh, don't worry.

266
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:08,770
It'll be very simple.

267
00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:13,310
You just need to move, like, you just need to move, like, a desk and a chair.

268
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:15,010
And they're like, oh, okay.

269
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:15,490
Yeah.

270
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:16,910
Like, I'm down for it.

271
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:20,990
If it's just, like, a chair and a table, then that's fine.

272
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:25,890
Little does he know, it was not just a chair or a table.

273
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:30,590
We had to do two trips.

274
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:35,290
We had...

275
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:45,990
The thing is, okay, the funny thing is that the mutual friend, not mutual, not my mutual, but, like, the friend of the friend, they were, like, a dad.

276
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:49,890
So, they're, like, much older because he has, like, five children.

277
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:50,890
Five kids.

278
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:53,150
So, like, my friend was like, oh, don't worry.

279
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:55,570
Like, he has a really big car.

280
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:58,250
He has a huge van because he has five kids.

281
00:15:58,530 --> 00:16:01,870
So, like, the van's gonna fit, like, everything.

282
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:03,030
And I was like, oh, that's sweet.

283
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:03,310
Yeah.

284
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:04,610
That's good to know.

285
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:05,870
And...

286
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:09,390
So, so, like, uh...

287
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:12,150
So, like, still, two trips, by the way.

288
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:13,990
It's still...

289
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:17,110
It's still requiring two trips.

290
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:24,450
Anyway, he felt really scammed because, apparently, he had to go to work at five in the morning the next day.

291
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:27,610
He had to go to...

292
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:29,630
He had to... He was like...

293
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:33,630
He, like, texted my friend because my friend was like, what the fuck happened?

294
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:41,990
I was like, oh, yeah, it was not just a desk and a chair, but... I was like, sorry.

295
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:45,070
It was not just a desk and a chair.

296
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:49,030
Because... Because...

297
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:52,790
Um... By the way, I felt really bad.

298
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:59,470
I didn't pay him because I was like... I felt really bad because, like, we had to do two trips and he had to carry everything.

299
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:02,330
He basically carried the majority of the stuff for me.

300
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:03,150
And...

301
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:05,770
And I was like...

302
00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:07,570
And I was like, I'm so sorry.

303
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:09,950
I could pay you a bit.

304
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:12,350
I could give you some money for, like...

305
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:15,530
Basically carrying everything.

306
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:20,130
Like, from the desk, the boxes, and... and, like, the chair.

307
00:17:20,590 --> 00:17:21,610
And so...

308
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:23,470
Okay, and then...

309
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:25,850
Okay, this is so embarrassing.

310
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:28,470
So he was like, oh, what do you do?

311
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:30,050
Like, oh, what do you do?

312
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:31,930
Oh, my gosh, you need, like, three monitors.

313
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:32,930
What do you do?

314
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:35,250
And I was like, oh, um...

315
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:37,870
Um, yeah, I, like...

316
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:38,930
It's NDA.

317
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:43,870
I can't really say what I do because it's, like, I signed, like, a contract.

318
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:47,750
So, like, it's sort of NDA and, uh...

319
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:49,690
And, like, for...

320
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:51,370
privacy sake, you know?

321
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:53,850
And then... So he was like...

322
00:17:53,850 --> 00:17:56,490
And then... But he was like, oh, but, like, do you make a lot?

323
00:17:56,730 --> 00:17:59,750
It seems like you make a lot to, like, live in such a nice place.

324
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:04,530
And then I was like, yeah, I make a lot of money.

325
00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:07,910
And then he was like, are you an OnlyFans?

326
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,160
I was like, no.

327
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:21,160
No.

328
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,660
It's not OnlyFans.

329
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:23,780
No.

330
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:30,880
I was like, no, it's not OnlyFans.

331
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:35,280
But it's not OnlyFans.

332
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,080
But it's not OnlyFans.

333
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:38,380
But it's not OnlyFans.

334
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:39,320
Oh my god.

335
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:40,800
Oh my god.

336
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:41,320
Um...

337
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:47,440
Yeah, so, like, he knows that it's not OnlyFans.

338
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:51,280
And, like, honestly, that's all that matters.

339
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:54,740
That's all that matters.

340
00:18:59,400 --> 00:18:59,960
But...

341
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:01,600
Um...

342
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,320
But, yeah, I like my new place a lot.

343
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:08,780
I just need to, um, you know, redecorate it a lot.

344
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:13,400
Especially, like, the streaming room, the office room.

345
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:14,700
Um...

346
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:18,240
Because, like I said, it's, like, super echoey right now.

347
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,660
The reverb and everything.

348
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:28,600
And, uh, definitely, I cannot use plushies as my, as my like, what's it called?

349
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:32,840
I cannot, guys, I cannot use plushies to absorb the sound, guys.

350
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:34,020
I hate it.

351
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:35,660
I hate it.

352
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:40,700
We need, like, actual, like, soundproof foam.

353
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:42,920
Um...

354
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:46,920
But, yeah, like I said, I really hate, I really hate, uh, um...

355
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:54,000
When, like, I have to, like, figure out, like, if my monitors are positioned correctly and everything.

356
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:57,060
Uh, because, like, I'm not used to I don't know.

357
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:57,560
It feels off.

358
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:58,660
It just, everything feels off.

359
00:19:58,720 --> 00:19:59,520
I just need to get used to it.

360
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:00,400
I can't fix it.

361
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,220
I just need to...

362
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:04,240
I just need to figure it out.

363
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,980
I need to figure it out.

364
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:08,720
Um, but yes, I'm glad to be...

365
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,660
Do I need to get another, another garbage bag of plushies?

366
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:12,480
I have one more.

367
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:14,700
I mean, this all came from one box.

368
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:16,940
I still have four more boxes, but I got fine.

369
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:19,100
Figure out where the four boxes are.

370
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:24,960
But should I grab one more, one more, one more bag of plushies and throw it in the corner?

371
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:26,600
I don't know which corner.

372
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:28,840
Which corner do I throw it?

373
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:29,640
Yeah, we, okay.

374
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:32,340
Alright, I'm gonna grab, I'll grab the last one.

375
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,620
I'll grab the last trash bag of plushies.

376
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:35,280
I'll be right back.

377
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:38,040
I don't know where the other box is!

378
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:39,400
There's so many boxes!

379
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:42,320
There's so many boxes.

380
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,540
I don't know what to do.

381
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,020
I'm coming back.

382
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,080
Dad thinks the plushies are for him.

383
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:20,320
Jokes on him.

384
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:21,500
They're not.

385
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:22,300
Okay.

386
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,600
You go in this corner.

387
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,760
You go in this corner.

388
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,140
And I guess I'll chuck them here.

389
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:29,500
Alright.

390
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,720
Four plushies on the corner.

391
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:34,140
Alright.

392
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,020
There we go.

393
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:41,840
That was an entire box of, an entire box of plushies.

394
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:42,900
Alright.

395
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,420
Oh, fuck.

396
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:45,540
I don't want to clean this up.

397
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:47,360
I don't want to clean.

398
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:50,060
Alright.

399
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,600
Anyway, I'm happy to be back.

400
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,600
Um...

401
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:58,400
Definitely feel like I need to adjust a lot of stuff right now.

402
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:01,280
Um, but yes!

403
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:06,100
I am currently streaming for the first time at my new place!

404
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:06,880
Yeah!

405
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:15,580
Before then, I had to do a commute back and forth because um, like I said, uh, I was not expecting...

406
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:19,120
Like, I didn't realize I had internet already in place.

407
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:22,280
I thought to install it, but it was, like, ready like, right away.

408
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:26,680
So, like, and I was like, oh, well, it's too late.

409
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:29,520
I still have to do the commute back and forth, so...

410
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:32,760
So, uh, I finally managed to plug everything in.

411
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:36,500
Um, everything is all plugged and everything is all working.

412
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,420
I think.

413
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,080
I hope so.

414
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:39,660
So, we're good for...

415
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:40,900
I didn't know what to play.

416
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:41,340
Like...

417
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,180
Yesterday, I was so tired.

418
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:45,340
I didn't... I...

419
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:47,380
It was funny because I made the...

420
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:48,360
Because I do have my laptop.

421
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:53,080
So, like, I made the waiting room on my laptop, but had nothing set up.

422
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:56,460
Like, I literally had, like, none of my stuff is plugged in.

423
00:22:56,520 --> 00:23:00,040
None of the cables are... Like, everything was... All the cables were in a box.

424
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:06,940
I put the waiting room up and I used that as, like, motivation to set everything up.

425
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:08,760
I was like, okay.

426
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:09,540
Okay.

427
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,360
I'm gonna have to...

428
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,540
I have a time.

429
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:19,780
I need to have everything set up by the time it's time to start stream.

430
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:23,580
Because it was, like, the only way to motivate me.

431
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:28,740
To actually put everything together before the starting stream time.

432
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:31,700
Because yesterday...

433
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:35,300
I was supposed to do it yesterday, but I fell asleep.

434
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:40,080
And I was supposed to do it... Yeah, I was supposed to do it yesterday and the day before yesterday.

435
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:40,700
Wait, no.

436
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:45,880
Yeah, yesterday and the day before yesterday, but I fell asleep.

437
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:46,460
So...

438
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:49,400
I kept...

439
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,940
I kept sleeping instead.

440
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:53,560
I was just very EP, okay?

441
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:55,100
I was just very EP.

442
00:23:55,580 --> 00:24:05,420
Um, so I had to do the waiting room as, like, my final resort to, like, actually set everything up for everything.

443
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:08,380
Oh, my God.

444
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,900
I'm such a mess, everybody.

445
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:11,940
Anyway, Wings, thank you for the super chat.

446
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:12,240
Thank you.

447
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:14,340
Do you have any towel racks and blankets?

448
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,700
Um, things you put on walls of your room?

449
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:18,460
It doesn't have to be professional soundproofing.

450
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:20,340
If you're just looking to dab... Wait, if I put...

451
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:22,860
posters, does it dampen the sound?

452
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:24,140
Guys?

453
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:25,420
Does it do that?

454
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:31,560
Does that... Because, like, I could... Instead of putting, like, foam, I can, like, put the soundproof foam.

455
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:32,160
I can just...

456
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,800
I can just put posters?

457
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,580
Does that work like that?

458
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:37,900
It does help?

459
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:38,680
No?

460
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:39,860
Okay, not much.

461
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:45,920
Okay, because, like, I'm, like, thinking, do I put posters or... Do I put posters or, like, the foam?

462
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:47,000
Technically.

463
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:50,800
Just... Okay, I'll put the foam.

464
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:53,440
Because I was like, do I put posters or foam?

465
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:54,940
Like, in front of me.

466
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:55,320
You know?

467
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:57,520
Like, in front of me at the moment.

468
00:24:57,740 --> 00:25:00,820
But then you guys are like, it doesn't really help that much.

469
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:04,180
Okay, I'll get foam.

470
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:07,360
I don't want it to look like a streamer room.

471
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:12,620
Like, you know, like, like the gaming room with, like, foam everywhere.

472
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:14,500
Like, foam in front of me.

473
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:15,780
It looks so ugly.

474
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:18,780
It's so ugly, though.

475
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:20,580
I don't want it.

476
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:23,440
I don't want it to look like a streamer room.

477
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:30,300
But you are... Yeah, but, like, I want it to be, like, aesthetic.

478
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:37,500
I just want it to be, like, a mini shrine room dedicated to me, you know?

479
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:39,580
There's thick curtains.

480
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:40,560
There's no windows.

481
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:42,500
What do you mean, thick curtains?

482
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:45,180
There's no... It's literally four walls.

483
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:47,860
Okay, one, two, three, four.

484
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:49,300
Sorry, I have to make sure there's four.

485
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,880
It's literally four walls of nothing.

486
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,940
It's literally four walls.

487
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:57,000
I have no windows.

488
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:02,560
That's true.

489
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:03,660
There's the glass door.

490
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:04,500
That's true.

491
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:05,080
That's true.

492
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,900
Anyway, guys, I thought it was so smart.

493
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:12,680
I was like, oh, man, I don't want to live in a green house because that's my problem with my old apartment.

494
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,160
It was like...

495
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:16,240
I had to make sure it was four, okay?

496
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:17,720
I had to make sure.

497
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:20,920
The thing is, my old apartment was a fucking green house.

498
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:22,560
But then I didn't realize.

499
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:26,880
I didn't realize the air conditioning fucking sucks in this room.

500
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:28,960
And I don't want to...

501
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:31,200
Oh, I need acoustic panels.

502
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:31,980
Okay.

503
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:34,400
Okay, sound guy, I need you to like...

504
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,400
Wait, can I put posters on the phone?

505
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:37,420
Would it look cool?

506
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,600
Would it look good, though?

507
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:40,880
Posters on the phone?

508
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,060
Oh, shit.

509
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:43,700
Thank you for the very first super chat.

510
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:44,120
Thank you.

511
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:44,900
Thank you.

512
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:48,540
Oh, my God.

513
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:50,740
It's like, I didn't want the sun to shine in.

514
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:57,220
But then, like, I can't... I can't turn up the air conditioning too much because I don't want to fucking freeze Dad.

515
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:59,680
I don't want to freeze him.

516
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:00,480
I don't want...

517
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:08,080
I don't want to open my glass door because, like, because then Dad's going to come in here, rip out, and take away my acoustic plushies.

518
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:10,220
Like, I need the plushies for...

519
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:12,700
I need the plushies for...

520
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:15,780
for the cats without the sound.

521
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:18,660
He's going to kidnap them if I...

522
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:20,540
if I open the door.

523
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:22,420
Get Dad a sweater.

524
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:23,340
Okay.

525
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:29,740
We're definitely going to need to buy a sweater for him because I'm going to be turning up the AC later.

526
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:31,160
Next time.

527
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:32,480
Because it's...

528
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,680
It's... I realize...

529
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,900
I realize we might not...

530
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:38,920
We might not have...

531
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:41,100
Like, um...

532
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:43,400
We might not, like, have the sun anymore.

533
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:47,260
But, like, my PC is still producing a lot of hot air.

534
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:48,100
.

535
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:53,020
Johnny, look good.

536
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:53,860
Thank you for the super chat.

537
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:54,160
Thank you.

538
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:54,520
Thank you.

539
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,560
Interior dog fence fun.

540
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,880
Thank you for the super chat.

541
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:58,220
Thank you.

542
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:58,800
Thank you.

543
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,000
Okay.

544
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,060
So, today, we are going to be playing Into the Pit.

545
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:06,320
Oh, also, like, I managed to... I... Hell no.

546
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:06,760
I don't know.

547
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:15,360
I don't know why you would watch me, but, like, um, Lazy Madman gave me an invite code for... Was it that new Riot fighting game?

548
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:17,480
2XKO or whatever?

549
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:24,900
So, I do have a... I do have, like, an invite to the... the Riot fighting game.

550
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,420
But, like, I...

551
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:29,680
I don't know how to fucking play fighting games, so...

552
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:31,640
Oh, sorry.

553
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:32,540
2K...

554
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:33,040
Guys!

555
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:35,140
I have... I don't know fighting games!

556
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,440
But, yeah, Lazy...

557
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:41,340
Lazy Madman gave me an invite to it yesterday.

558
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:44,500
So, like, this week, we're gonna... I guess... I mean, it's Alpha.

559
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:50,280
So, like, this week, we're gonna check it out, I guess, and get absolutely destroyed.

560
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:54,120
So... So, we're gonna...

561
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:56,580
We're gonna try that out, like, this week.

562
00:28:56,800 --> 00:29:02,360
And then, other than that, I think this week's schedule is, like, God of War, 2XKO, and then a member stream.

563
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:03,980
Because we don't really have a lot of days.

564
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:05,420
You know what I'm super excited about?

565
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:08,120
Next week is gonna be, uh, Wukong.

566
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:10,620
Um, Wukong's coming out next week, I think.

567
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:11,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

568
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:14,040
Wukong's coming out next week, and I'm super-duper excited.

569
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,980
Uh, for that.

570
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,060
We're gonna start Wukong.

571
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:19,700
I think we're gonna do Wukong on on launch day.

572
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:21,840
Like, launch hour launch day.

573
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:23,960
So, like, I'm super excited about that game.

574
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:25,640
Because that game looks really, really good.

575
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:28,240
I mean, like, it'll... I hope.

576
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,420
I hope so!

577
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:30,640
I really hope so!

578
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:30,940
Anyway!

579
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:31,680
Anyway!

580
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:35,720
Um, happy 10-year anniversary for FNAF!

581
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:41,760
Um, this is one of the many games they released for, uh, to celebrate 10 years.

582
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:42,720
I can't believe it.

583
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:45,520
10 years of Five Nights at Freddy's.

584
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:50,580
Um, and apparently this game is really good in the series.

585
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:52,400
Even though, like, it's not...

586
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,820
it's not... it's different from the actual...

587
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:57,820
it's different from the, um, the other games.

588
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,260
But people are saying it's really, really good.

589
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:03,700
And, um, they have a VTuber reference in there.

590
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:10,220
There's a VTuber reference in there, which I thought was...

591
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:12,120
which I thought was pretty funny.

592
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,160
I saw, like, a screenshot of it.

593
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:15,400
I was like, what the fuck?

594
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:24,560
Yeah, yeah, they added... they added V... they added, like, a VTuber fan in the game.

595
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,480
Alright, Sound Guy, let me know how the sound is like.

596
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:29,020
Let me know if it's okay.

597
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:31,140
Ooh!

598
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:33,720
Wow!

599
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:35,220
Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, sorry.

600
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:35,960
And you're like...

601
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:39,380
I'm like, I don't even know if, like, everything's okay right now.

602
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:46,200
I feel... I just feel a little off.

603
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,060
Just a little bit.

604
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,860
Alright, this game has an autosave feature.

605
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,560
I love autosave features.

606
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:55,260
I love that.

607
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:55,540
Whoa!

608
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:58,180
I need to turn it down for myself.

609
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,020
Alright, Mega Cat Studios.

610
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:05,640
Apparently, they made FNAF Mario Kart, but, like, it's not...

611
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:07,400
It's, like, buggy as hell.

612
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:08,860
Press any key...

613
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:09,540
Alright.

614
00:31:12,890 --> 00:31:13,330
Okay.

615
00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:15,510
Oh!

616
00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:18,150
Okay, settings...

617
00:31:18,150 --> 00:31:20,330
So, yeah, this game recently came out.

618
00:31:20,530 --> 00:31:21,730
And I was like, fuck it.

619
00:31:21,810 --> 00:31:23,390
I don't wanna lose FOMO.

620
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:25,210
And apparently it's, um...

621
00:31:25,210 --> 00:31:28,770
It's not that long, which enables... You know what?

622
00:31:28,810 --> 00:31:29,550
Fuck it, let's go.

623
00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:35,530
Fuck it, let's do this.

624
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:38,710
Alright, font size...

625
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:38,930
Ooh!

626
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:39,990
What the fuck?

627
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:41,970
That's huge!

628
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:42,450
Okay.

629
00:31:42,530 --> 00:31:43,530
Hint rate...

630
00:31:44,390 --> 00:31:45,290
Five minutes.

631
00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:47,430
Okay, wait.

632
00:31:47,570 --> 00:31:48,610
Alright, ten minutes.

633
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:49,890
Okay, ten minutes is good.

634
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:52,350
Okay, hiding minigames...

635
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:53,050
Default?

636
00:31:53,090 --> 00:31:53,390
What is it?

637
00:31:53,430 --> 00:31:53,890
Autoplay?

638
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:56,910
Okay, default, run mode...

639
00:31:56,910 --> 00:31:58,810
Uh... There's streamer mode?

640
00:31:59,230 --> 00:32:00,870
What's... Which one is streamer mode?

641
00:32:01,150 --> 00:32:01,550
Oh!

642
00:32:03,410 --> 00:32:03,910
Okay.

643
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:05,850
Uh...

644
00:32:05,850 --> 00:32:08,810
I actually have, like, no idea what this game is about.

645
00:32:08,890 --> 00:32:13,890
Apparently... I was looking up, like, I was trying to, like, um... Before I was, like, Oh, maybe I should make my own thumbnail.

646
00:32:14,330 --> 00:32:17,190
Because I figured... I was, like, trying to debate on what to play.

647
00:32:17,530 --> 00:32:19,850
Because I was, like, okay, what's a good one-off today?

648
00:32:20,210 --> 00:32:22,510
Because, like, I didn't want to play, like, a series.

649
00:32:22,730 --> 00:32:24,510
And then I was, like, what's a good one-off?

650
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:25,910
And then I was, like, alright, we're gonna...

651
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:28,110
We're gonna do this as a one-off.

652
00:32:28,430 --> 00:32:33,790
Um, and... But the thing is, like, I decided that at, like, 9 a.m.

653
00:32:33,950 --> 00:32:34,790
And I told my...

654
00:32:34,790 --> 00:32:37,630
I didn't know my thumbnail maker is, like, awake.

655
00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:40,030
And I felt really bad.

656
00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:43,310
Because I was, like, hey, can you make a thumbnail within, like, one to two hours?

657
00:32:43,530 --> 00:32:45,270
Because I don't even know you're awake right now.

658
00:32:45,550 --> 00:32:47,930
I don't think this... I was trying to make my own...

659
00:32:47,930 --> 00:32:49,650
I was trying to make my own thumbnail.

660
00:32:49,730 --> 00:32:52,790
And, like, I found out it was based off a book or something.

661
00:32:53,130 --> 00:32:54,350
It was, like, a fan game.

662
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:57,190
And then Scott was, like, mine.

663
00:33:02,390 --> 00:33:02,790
So...

664
00:33:03,910 --> 00:33:04,310
Um...

665
00:33:05,730 --> 00:33:07,510
So, um... Now it's...

666
00:33:07,630 --> 00:33:08,070
Is it canon?

667
00:33:08,250 --> 00:33:08,830
I don't know.

668
00:33:08,890 --> 00:33:11,110
I have no idea if this is canon or not.

669
00:33:11,330 --> 00:33:12,950
But people said it's really good.

670
00:33:13,150 --> 00:33:14,010
So, we'll see.

671
00:33:14,210 --> 00:33:18,650
I mean, I actually have, like, no idea what the actual story of FNAF is.

672
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:19,710
So...

673
00:33:19,710 --> 00:33:21,630
Uh, this is gonna be interesting.

674
00:33:23,730 --> 00:33:25,050
Oh, it's canon now?

675
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:26,090
That's sweet.

676
00:33:26,390 --> 00:33:26,670
Alright.

677
00:33:27,930 --> 00:33:28,450
Uh...

678
00:33:29,330 --> 00:33:29,850
Yes.

679
00:33:30,190 --> 00:33:32,950
You can barely see the center.

680
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:34,710
Alright, that means...

681
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:36,930
It won't be scary if I...

682
00:33:37,630 --> 00:33:39,450
I imagine I played it like that.

683
00:33:42,430 --> 00:33:43,070
Okay.

684
00:33:43,470 --> 00:33:45,050
Alright, we'll do middle.

685
00:33:45,950 --> 00:33:47,170
Middle seems good.

686
00:33:49,150 --> 00:33:49,790
Alright.

687
00:33:51,330 --> 00:33:51,970
Confirm.

688
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:54,110
Creepy, frightening, a balanced...

689
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:55,530
A narrative experience?

690
00:33:56,030 --> 00:33:57,370
A balance experience?

691
00:33:59,230 --> 00:34:00,670
Wait, what's normal?

692
00:34:02,010 --> 00:34:03,190
Okay, I guess...

693
00:34:03,190 --> 00:34:04,050
Frightening?

694
00:34:04,330 --> 00:34:05,270
Is this easy?

695
00:34:05,570 --> 00:34:07,530
Is this... I don't need...

696
00:34:07,630 --> 00:34:09,470
Fucking random names, like...

697
00:34:09,470 --> 00:34:09,710
I...

698
00:34:10,910 --> 00:34:13,770
Please, just make it easy, medium, hard.

699
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:14,790
Like, I can't...

700
00:34:14,790 --> 00:34:16,390
What the fuck does creepy mean?

701
00:34:16,830 --> 00:34:17,690
What does...

702
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:20,150
What does creepy mean?

703
00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:22,190
What does frightening mean?

704
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:25,950
Just give me easy, mean, normal, hard.

705
00:34:29,370 --> 00:34:30,110
Creepy... Okay.

706
00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:31,530
They're both scary.

707
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:34,530
Like, they both mean the same thing.

708
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:35,870
Um...

709
00:34:35,870 --> 00:34:37,490
Creepy means super okay.

710
00:34:37,770 --> 00:34:38,130
Frightening.

711
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:38,970
Alright.

712
00:34:39,290 --> 00:34:39,650
Yes.

713
00:34:40,470 --> 00:34:41,470
Alright, we're gonna go with that.

714
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:44,010
Creepy equals evil.

715
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:45,870
I'm so sad I didn't get to go to artist...

716
00:34:45,870 --> 00:34:47,110
I didn't get to walk around...

717
00:34:47,530 --> 00:34:51,450
Get taken around Artist Alley for my two conventions last week.

718
00:34:51,530 --> 00:34:52,150
I was so busy.

719
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:53,650
I was so busy.

720
00:34:53,810 --> 00:34:55,170
I was really upset about that.

721
00:34:55,270 --> 00:34:57,430
Not upset, but I'm just sad I couldn't do it.

722
00:34:57,490 --> 00:34:58,530
Just because of how busy I was.

723
00:34:58,730 --> 00:34:59,890
Oh no, it's time to read.

724
00:35:00,690 --> 00:35:01,210
Oswald!

725
00:35:01,530 --> 00:35:02,730
It's time to go!

726
00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:05,470
My god!

727
00:35:07,350 --> 00:35:09,750
Why is he drawing animatronics?

728
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:14,710
You know what this style reminds me of?

729
00:35:14,870 --> 00:35:16,470
Like the Rick and Morty pixel art.

730
00:35:17,970 --> 00:35:18,910
Pocket Mortys!

731
00:35:19,070 --> 00:35:19,590
Yes!

732
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:20,910
That's what it reminds me of.

733
00:35:21,050 --> 00:35:21,970
Pocket Mortys.

734
00:35:23,050 --> 00:35:24,950
Isn't there anywhere else I can go?

735
00:35:25,210 --> 00:35:27,730
The pizza was good the first couple of times.

736
00:35:28,010 --> 00:35:29,810
But I really want to do something new.

737
00:35:32,390 --> 00:35:34,310
Aw, come on, Oz.

738
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:35,230
Aw, come on, Oz.

739
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:37,650
Wait, is my dad single?

740
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:39,090
Is he divorced?

741
00:35:39,490 --> 00:35:40,150
Where's mom?

742
00:35:41,210 --> 00:35:42,850
Aw, come on, Oz.

743
00:35:43,410 --> 00:35:46,010
Jeff's can't be the worst place to hang out.

744
00:35:46,690 --> 00:35:47,010
Jeff's can't be the worst place to hang out.

745
00:35:47,170 --> 00:35:51,370
Every day has been the same all summer long.

746
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:51,790
Every day has been the same all summer long.

747
00:35:51,790 --> 00:36:00,770
I go in, get pizza, stare at the grease stained yellow walls stare at the grease stained yellow walls Where's mom?

748
00:36:02,010 --> 00:36:03,810
Didn't wait for you to pick me up.

749
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:05,930
Where's the fun in that?

750
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:08,530
I'm almost glad school's starting tomorrow.

751
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:13,710
Just so I can only have to see that place on the weekends now.

752
00:36:14,430 --> 00:36:15,710
I'm sorry, son.

753
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:22,310
I know no kids only option for fun should be hanging around a rundown pizza joint.

754
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:24,050
But Jeff is all we got.

755
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:25,970
It's all we can afford.

756
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:27,290
Just leave him at home.

757
00:36:28,050 --> 00:36:30,290
What's wrong with leaving the child at home?

758
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:32,830
Am I allowed to say that?

759
00:36:33,050 --> 00:36:34,730
I was left at home alone a lot.

760
00:36:36,170 --> 00:36:37,070
Is that illegal?

761
00:36:40,170 --> 00:36:41,470
Wait, is that illegal?

762
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:49,190
I was not left home alone, guys.

763
00:36:49,530 --> 00:36:49,970
Guys!

764
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:50,730
Guys!

765
00:36:50,810 --> 00:36:51,630
I lied.

766
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:52,870
I was not.

767
00:36:53,170 --> 00:36:55,150
I was not left home alone.

768
00:37:00,270 --> 00:37:04,830
You know, money's been tight since the mill closed.

769
00:37:05,290 --> 00:37:08,510
Once I'm a full time at the corner store...

770
00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:10,910
If the corner store...

771
00:37:10,910 --> 00:37:14,730
Hypothetically, I might have been left alone a lot at home.

772
00:37:16,050 --> 00:37:22,550
If the corner store even survives that long, everything in this town is dead or dying.

773
00:37:22,770 --> 00:37:25,050
And there's no telling what's closing next.

774
00:37:25,270 --> 00:37:25,590
...

775
00:37:27,290 --> 00:37:30,270
Why can't we go to the next town over where everyone else is moving?

776
00:37:30,570 --> 00:37:32,410
All my friends are there now.

777
00:37:32,810 --> 00:37:36,090
It can't be that hard for grandma to travel a few miles.

778
00:37:38,070 --> 00:37:38,610
Well...

779
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:42,990
Unless her frail bones overnight.

780
00:37:44,330 --> 00:37:45,830
Moving is a no-go.

781
00:37:47,370 --> 00:37:48,530
Put her in a home.

782
00:37:49,870 --> 00:37:50,830
Wait, that's fucked.

783
00:37:51,030 --> 00:37:51,530
Sorry.

784
00:37:52,990 --> 00:37:56,230
Can we just pack grandma up in some bubble wrap?

785
00:37:58,550 --> 00:37:59,110
Huh.

786
00:37:59,390 --> 00:38:01,110
If only they were that easy.

787
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:05,410
Even with the mighty strength of bubble wrap, she...

788
00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:06,750
Oh, they can cause they're poor.

789
00:38:06,990 --> 00:38:08,330
I fucking forgot about that.

790
00:38:08,950 --> 00:38:10,790
She's still too fragile.

791
00:38:11,390 --> 00:38:13,330
And that's not going to change.

792
00:38:15,930 --> 00:38:17,030
Fucking grandma.

793
00:38:19,010 --> 00:38:24,690
Speaking of things not changing, I bet that possum is still on the corner at the stoplight.

794
00:38:25,490 --> 00:38:26,250
Oh yeah?

795
00:38:27,290 --> 00:38:27,850
Let's make a deal.

796
00:38:28,090 --> 00:38:33,250
If that critter's still there, I'll give you an extra buck for another slice of Jeff's.

797
00:38:33,350 --> 00:38:36,170
Wait, it's called Jeff's instead of Five Nights at Freddy's?

798
00:38:36,650 --> 00:38:40,450
What kind of fucking, like, pizza joint is just called Jeff?

799
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:47,120
Easy money?

800
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:48,020
Oh!

801
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:50,280
Oh!

802
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:52,760
Still... that's fucked.

803
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:55,840
What the fu- Still dead.

804
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:57,760
Why the fuck would you show your kid that?

805
00:38:58,500 --> 00:38:59,080
Bro!

806
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:01,740
What?

807
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:03,220
What?

808
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:06,760
Things will get better, Oz.

809
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:08,640
It's like...

810
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:12,460
What kind of dad am I if I can't make him happy?

811
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:15,280
Let alone afford to feed him more than pizza.

812
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:17,340
But kids love pizza, Dad!

813
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:18,980
I had pizza yesterday.

814
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:23,460
I'm sorry things turned out this way, Oswald.

815
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:28,070
I think it's YouTube.

816
00:39:28,210 --> 00:39:29,410
Cause my internet's fine.

817
00:39:30,870 --> 00:39:31,390
Well...

818
00:39:32,330 --> 00:39:32,770
Yeah, Dad.

819
00:39:36,230 --> 00:39:38,670
Remember when this was the place to be?

820
00:39:41,310 --> 00:39:41,870
Totally.

821
00:39:41,970 --> 00:39:44,130
My parents took me here all the time.

822
00:39:44,490 --> 00:39:47,830
I still remember playing in the ball pit and getting- What?

823
00:39:48,410 --> 00:39:50,370
And getting ring- When is this?

824
00:39:50,670 --> 00:39:51,410
When is this?

825
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:53,990
That's a health code violation.

826
00:39:54,290 --> 00:39:55,470
And a ringworm.

827
00:39:56,470 --> 00:39:57,030
Ew.

828
00:39:57,330 --> 00:39:59,250
Probably why it's still roped up.

829
00:39:59,250 --> 00:40:01,090
That and well...

830
00:40:01,090 --> 00:40:03,250
You know...

831
00:40:03,950 --> 00:40:04,470
Hmm...

832
00:40:05,210 --> 00:40:06,170
Secret ball pit?

833
00:40:07,090 --> 00:40:07,610
Huh?

834
00:40:08,330 --> 00:40:10,070
Oh yeah, never touch ball pits.

835
00:40:10,190 --> 00:40:11,050
They never clean it.

836
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:18,870
What I've heard is that it doesn't matter what kind of ball pit, but they never clean the ball pits cause there's no point.

837
00:40:19,370 --> 00:40:21,290
They're like really nasty and everything.

838
00:40:22,110 --> 00:40:23,090
Oh my god!

839
00:40:23,110 --> 00:40:25,250
There's my secret tablet!

840
00:40:25,250 --> 00:40:25,470
I'm here!

841
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:28,550
Free refills.

842
00:40:28,570 --> 00:40:28,990
For what?

843
00:40:29,090 --> 00:40:30,570
I only wish it was orange juice.

844
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:32,650
Hey!

845
00:40:32,810 --> 00:40:34,130
Speed runs start now!

846
00:40:37,550 --> 00:40:38,390
Hey kid.

847
00:40:38,630 --> 00:40:41,170
You want another slice of cheese and a refill on that orange juice?

848
00:40:42,290 --> 00:40:43,290
Not right now.

849
00:40:43,350 --> 00:40:44,190
Just checking around.

850
00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:46,610
Well, have fun.

851
00:40:46,870 --> 00:40:50,170
Not much to look at other than dust bunnies and cobwebs.

852
00:40:50,390 --> 00:40:51,530
I don't think they bite.

853
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:53,470
Dust bunnies?

854
00:40:54,270 --> 00:40:54,790
No.

855
00:40:55,250 --> 00:40:56,410
The wolf spiders.

856
00:40:56,990 --> 00:40:57,510
Okay!

857
00:40:57,610 --> 00:40:59,570
This has to be the 80s!

858
00:40:59,610 --> 00:41:03,650
Like there's... what are the help code... what are all these help code violations?

859
00:41:04,530 --> 00:41:05,050
Oh.

860
00:41:05,170 --> 00:41:05,890
Good luck then.

861
00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:07,710
Alright.

862
00:41:09,110 --> 00:41:10,410
The door is locked?

863
00:41:11,990 --> 00:41:13,110
How's the door locked?

864
00:41:14,290 --> 00:41:15,350
Isn't this the entrance?

865
00:41:15,610 --> 00:41:16,590
To the pizza joint?

866
00:41:18,350 --> 00:41:19,650
This has to be.

867
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:23,230
This is like the time where you can break as many help codes as you want.

868
00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:27,430
They don't even have any good flavors there.

869
00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:31,310
I promise that I stay here until I come to get them.

870
00:41:31,830 --> 00:41:32,390
Okay.

871
00:41:32,410 --> 00:41:33,630
We gotta find the ball pit.

872
00:41:34,410 --> 00:41:36,270
You can never leave!

873
00:41:37,610 --> 00:41:38,170
Ooh.

874
00:41:38,450 --> 00:41:40,250
I mean extra protein though.

875
00:41:40,590 --> 00:41:42,190
The wolf spiders in your pizza?

876
00:41:42,310 --> 00:41:43,550
You got some extra proteins.

877
00:41:44,570 --> 00:41:45,130
Okay.

878
00:41:45,150 --> 00:41:45,710
Employees?

879
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:46,970
It has to be here, right?

880
00:41:48,050 --> 00:41:49,210
The door is locked.

881
00:41:49,570 --> 00:41:50,070
Oh.

882
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:50,470
Can I...

883
00:41:50,470 --> 00:41:53,510
Let's not talk about that disgusting ball pit anymore.

884
00:41:54,330 --> 00:41:55,190
Pre-dashed.

885
00:41:55,250 --> 00:41:55,450
Con.

886
00:41:56,150 --> 00:41:56,850
It's employed.

887
00:41:57,110 --> 00:41:57,890
Can I go through there?

888
00:41:58,490 --> 00:41:58,970
Okay.

889
00:41:59,030 --> 00:41:59,250
No.

890
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:04,650
Well, I mean it's 2D so like there's not much area to go.

891
00:42:05,410 --> 00:42:05,890
Whoa.

892
00:42:06,650 --> 00:42:07,130
Hey!

893
00:42:07,310 --> 00:42:08,170
It does exist!

894
00:42:09,370 --> 00:42:11,230
It looks kinda gross.

895
00:42:12,010 --> 00:42:16,710
But I wonder what Dad would do if I hid and went missing for a while.

896
00:42:16,930 --> 00:42:20,570
Maybe teach him a lesson not to leave me at such a creepy place all day.

897
00:42:21,270 --> 00:42:21,750
Okay.

898
00:42:21,950 --> 00:42:22,190
Whoa!

899
00:42:22,350 --> 00:42:22,730
Whoa!

900
00:42:25,250 --> 00:42:25,370
Oh.

901
00:42:25,410 --> 00:42:26,770
Bring down the music a little bit.

902
00:42:26,870 --> 00:42:27,130
Okay.

903
00:42:27,190 --> 00:42:27,610
Don't worry.

904
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:28,010
Wait.

905
00:42:28,070 --> 00:42:30,210
Does it stop by What are you trying?

906
00:42:30,270 --> 00:42:30,490
Okay.

907
00:42:30,650 --> 00:42:30,990
Alright.

908
00:42:31,210 --> 00:42:31,930
Oh no guys.

909
00:42:32,110 --> 00:42:33,970
I am I'm losing time!

910
00:42:35,310 --> 00:42:37,230
I didn't bring down the music!

911
00:42:38,230 --> 00:42:38,710
Okay.

912
00:42:38,770 --> 00:42:41,550
Bring down the music and then overall Okay.

913
00:42:41,730 --> 00:42:42,530
Oh no guys.

914
00:42:42,650 --> 00:42:44,410
I'm losing time on my speed run.

915
00:42:48,150 --> 00:42:48,630
Alright.

916
00:42:49,190 --> 00:42:51,050
Here's hoping I don't get pink eye.

917
00:42:52,450 --> 00:42:54,310
Like kids pee and poop everywhere.

918
00:42:55,250 --> 00:42:55,870
Oh God.

919
00:42:59,430 --> 00:42:59,950
Wait.

920
00:43:00,070 --> 00:43:00,330
What?

921
00:43:04,590 --> 00:43:05,350
What the?

922
00:43:06,390 --> 00:43:06,910
Wait.

923
00:43:06,970 --> 00:43:07,270
What?

924
00:43:08,250 --> 00:43:10,950
Is this a time travel ball pit?

925
00:43:11,470 --> 00:43:14,230
It's like hot tub hot tub time machine?

926
00:43:14,390 --> 00:43:15,370
Ball pit time machine?

927
00:43:17,150 --> 00:43:17,670
What?

928
00:43:19,310 --> 00:43:20,170
Where am I?

929
00:43:20,250 --> 00:43:20,670
Children!

930
00:43:21,430 --> 00:43:22,970
Is this the bite of 55?

931
00:43:23,710 --> 00:43:26,110
Dad says we're gonna go to the movies later!

932
00:43:27,230 --> 00:43:27,710
No!

933
00:43:27,770 --> 00:43:28,670
It's the bite of 25!

934
00:43:30,910 --> 00:43:31,390
Yes!

935
00:43:32,750 --> 00:43:34,490
You know I watched it.

936
00:43:34,610 --> 00:43:36,210
I watched that in 3 years.

937
00:43:36,330 --> 00:43:38,210
I was way too young to be watching that!

938
00:43:39,150 --> 00:43:40,330
What are you saying?

939
00:43:42,450 --> 00:43:42,930
No!

940
00:43:43,030 --> 00:43:43,930
It's 82 right?

941
00:43:44,310 --> 00:43:44,710
Oh!

942
00:43:44,790 --> 00:43:45,770
It's the bite of 82!

943
00:43:47,390 --> 00:43:48,310
I don't know.

944
00:43:48,430 --> 00:43:50,030
Something about people busting ghosts.

945
00:43:50,130 --> 00:43:51,290
Can't remember the title.

946
00:43:52,310 --> 00:43:54,050
1825 Oh!

947
00:43:54,170 --> 00:43:55,150
I saw that one last week!

948
00:43:55,270 --> 00:43:56,290
Don't get slimed!

949
00:43:59,190 --> 00:44:01,370
These characters look like the ones I draw!

950
00:44:02,230 --> 00:44:02,830
Wait!

951
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:03,670
Am I purple guy?

952
00:44:06,470 --> 00:44:07,230
Did I?

953
00:44:07,350 --> 00:44:09,350
Am I purple guy?

954
00:44:10,270 --> 00:44:11,810
This place is the best!

955
00:44:12,010 --> 00:44:13,310
I wanna stay here forever!

956
00:44:14,670 --> 00:44:20,290
Bite of 9-1-1 Bite of 9-1-1 Let's eat!

957
00:44:21,950 --> 00:44:22,750
Let's go!

958
00:44:23,630 --> 00:44:25,190
Let's go!

959
00:44:26,410 --> 00:44:31,210
A brown bear, a blue rabbit, and some kind of bird girl!

960
00:44:32,830 --> 00:44:33,350
Creepy!

961
00:44:34,310 --> 00:44:36,290
But everyone seems to like them!

962
00:44:36,550 --> 00:44:37,990
I mean they are not creepy yet!

963
00:44:39,490 --> 00:44:40,010
Okay...

964
00:44:43,090 --> 00:44:44,930
I heard there is a new game in the arcade!

965
00:44:45,190 --> 00:44:46,110
We should check it out!

966
00:44:46,370 --> 00:44:47,550
I bet it's rad!

967
00:44:48,570 --> 00:44:51,610
I bet can land the highest score before anyone else can!

968
00:44:52,710 --> 00:44:54,250
I bet can land the highest score before anyone else can!

969
00:44:54,250 --> 00:44:55,830
Nerdiest kid!

970
00:44:56,070 --> 00:44:56,550
Oh!

971
00:44:57,170 --> 00:44:57,690
Candy!

972
00:44:58,110 --> 00:44:59,530
25 cents for candy?

973
00:44:59,730 --> 00:45:02,010
I could eat candy for the rest of my life!

974
00:45:02,350 --> 00:45:03,970
Mom wouldn't like that though!

975
00:45:04,850 --> 00:45:06,110
I need more tokens!

976
00:45:06,250 --> 00:45:07,930
I think I lost mine in the ball pit!

977
00:45:08,250 --> 00:45:09,510
Where the fuck am I?

978
00:45:09,570 --> 00:45:10,390
What year is this?

979
00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:11,530
Yo dude!

980
00:45:11,950 --> 00:45:12,770
Yo dude!

981
00:45:13,150 --> 00:45:13,830
Rad clothes!

982
00:45:14,150 --> 00:45:15,950
Haven't seen a get up like that before!

983
00:45:16,270 --> 00:45:17,850
It's a shirt and jacket!

984
00:45:20,010 --> 00:45:21,130
Thank you!

985
00:45:21,910 --> 00:45:24,070
Bro this kid is wearing a jacket too!

986
00:45:24,850 --> 00:45:25,990
This kid is...

987
00:45:27,170 --> 00:45:28,150
Yo dude!

988
00:45:28,370 --> 00:45:29,490
A shirt and jacket?

989
00:45:29,690 --> 00:45:30,870
Never seen that before!

990
00:45:35,590 --> 00:45:38,550
I like your future of the flashback shirt!

991
00:45:39,050 --> 00:45:41,150
That's my favorite old movie!

992
00:45:42,150 --> 00:45:42,710
Old?

993
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:44,290
What are you talking about?

994
00:45:44,490 --> 00:45:46,830
That movie came out like 3 weeks ago!

995
00:45:47,090 --> 00:45:48,750
Oh I went back in time!

996
00:45:51,130 --> 00:45:51,870
Chill out!

997
00:45:52,010 --> 00:45:53,370
He's just messing around!

998
00:45:54,130 --> 00:45:56,230
I'm Mike and that's Chip!

999
00:45:56,450 --> 00:45:57,670
Got a name kid?

1000
00:45:59,110 --> 00:46:00,310
I'm Oswald!

1001
00:46:01,590 --> 00:46:02,190
Oswald?

1002
00:46:02,350 --> 00:46:03,150
Like the wizard!

1003
00:46:04,250 --> 00:46:05,250
The wizard?

1004
00:46:06,870 --> 00:46:08,150
Of Oz of course!

1005
00:46:09,310 --> 00:46:10,150
Oh yeah!

1006
00:46:10,210 --> 00:46:11,390
I saw that one once!

1007
00:46:11,630 --> 00:46:12,830
My parents called me Oz!

1008
00:46:12,970 --> 00:46:14,390
Guess where they got the name from?

1009
00:46:15,410 --> 00:46:17,850
How come we've never seen you around Oz?

1010
00:46:19,310 --> 00:46:19,910
Um...

1011
00:46:21,130 --> 00:46:22,670
You're still in my dad's buzz!

1012
00:46:24,070 --> 00:46:25,370
That's a good question!

1013
00:46:26,590 --> 00:46:26,990
Ha!

1014
00:46:27,170 --> 00:46:28,490
You're a fun guy!

1015
00:46:30,350 --> 00:46:33,170
It's okay to be the new kid in town Oz!

1016
00:46:33,470 --> 00:46:37,130
The new mill is bringing a lot of newbies like you into town!

1017
00:46:38,370 --> 00:46:38,970
New?

1018
00:46:40,370 --> 00:46:41,950
Brand new steel mill!

1019
00:46:42,190 --> 00:46:43,730
My dad works there!

1020
00:46:44,130 --> 00:46:45,690
Mike's dad does too!

1021
00:46:46,130 --> 00:46:46,570
Heck!

1022
00:46:46,710 --> 00:46:49,350
I bet that's where your dad got a job!

1023
00:46:49,830 --> 00:46:50,050
Heck!

1024
00:46:50,050 --> 00:46:50,050
I bet that's where your dad got a job!

1025
00:46:52,150 --> 00:46:53,310
I'm sorry guys!

1026
00:46:53,510 --> 00:46:55,430
I'm still in my dad's ball pit!

1027
00:46:57,650 --> 00:46:58,250
What?

1028
00:46:59,270 --> 00:46:59,870
But...

1029
00:47:01,390 --> 00:47:02,330
Chip dude!

1030
00:47:02,570 --> 00:47:04,050
You're stressing the newbie out!

1031
00:47:04,470 --> 00:47:08,290
Let's have some fun while he settles in!

1032
00:47:09,630 --> 00:47:12,070
You wanna play pizza roller with us Oz?

1033
00:47:12,850 --> 00:47:14,230
That sounds fun!

1034
00:47:14,830 --> 00:47:17,050
But I don't think I'm supposed to be here!

1035
00:47:18,270 --> 00:47:18,870
Well...

1036
00:47:18,870 --> 00:47:19,930
Where else would you be?

1037
00:47:21,210 --> 00:47:21,770
Whoa!

1038
00:47:23,750 --> 00:47:24,870
What's he doing there?

1039
00:47:25,330 --> 00:47:26,310
Come on man!

1040
00:47:26,690 --> 00:47:28,730
I wanna talk about more movies with you!

1041
00:47:29,670 --> 00:47:30,310
It's seldom!

1042
00:47:30,590 --> 00:47:31,890
Follow us to the arcade!

1043
00:47:35,210 --> 00:47:35,770
Alright...

1044
00:47:35,770 --> 00:47:37,970
I don't know what's going on but...

1045
00:47:37,970 --> 00:47:39,890
Couldn't hurt to hang around a while!

1046
00:47:40,570 --> 00:47:42,510
He's hiding that gross ball pit!

1047
00:47:42,790 --> 00:47:44,910
And who knows when dad will show up anyway!

1048
00:47:45,370 --> 00:47:47,890
Yeah, dad's gonna be like 20 years too late!

1049
00:47:49,650 --> 00:47:50,210
Worse!

1050
00:47:51,950 --> 00:47:54,050
Thank you for the super chat!

1051
00:47:54,170 --> 00:47:54,530
Thank you!

1052
00:47:55,310 --> 00:47:55,970
Pizza!

1053
00:47:56,230 --> 00:47:56,630
Pizza!

1054
00:47:58,210 --> 00:47:58,870
Alright...

1055
00:47:59,730 --> 00:48:00,730
Oh man!

1056
00:48:00,910 --> 00:48:02,390
This is some good stuff!

1057
00:48:03,810 --> 00:48:05,350
Oh this is uh...

1058
00:48:05,350 --> 00:48:06,210
This is weird!

1059
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:07,830
Pirate guy!

1060
00:48:07,990 --> 00:48:08,390
FOXY!

1061
00:48:08,970 --> 00:48:10,130
I forgot!

1062
00:48:10,790 --> 00:48:11,450
Foxy!

1063
00:48:11,970 --> 00:48:12,810
Pirate guy!

1064
00:48:15,970 --> 00:48:17,470
Pineapple on pizza!

1065
00:48:17,470 --> 00:48:17,870
Pizza?

1066
00:48:18,710 --> 00:48:20,190
Oh, the humanity!

1067
00:48:22,070 --> 00:48:23,690
Alright, let's go over here.

1068
00:48:23,870 --> 00:48:26,530
That reminded me of the Italy vs.

1069
00:48:26,750 --> 00:48:28,670
Hong Kong pizza thing that happened.

1070
00:48:29,650 --> 00:48:30,910
Did you guys hear?

1071
00:48:31,750 --> 00:48:37,390
In the Olympics, for the finals for fencing, it was like Hong Kong vs.

1072
00:48:37,630 --> 00:48:37,910
Italy.

1073
00:48:38,330 --> 00:48:45,690
And then it was so close that they had to get video footage to find out who won.

1074
00:48:45,690 --> 00:48:52,670
Literally, because it was on the dot and they had to watch the replay like three plus times.

1075
00:48:53,050 --> 00:48:59,250
And then Hong Kong won and Italy was so mad and they were like, No!

1076
00:48:59,430 --> 00:49:00,630
Italy should have won that!

1077
00:49:01,130 --> 00:49:05,470
And then Hong Kong Pizza Hut did a special promotion with pineapple.

1078
00:49:05,910 --> 00:49:14,610
And then apparently people from Hong Kong were trolling Italians by talking about how much they love pineapple on pizza.

1079
00:49:14,810 --> 00:49:15,410
And...

1080
00:49:17,110 --> 00:49:18,030
Oh shit!

1081
00:49:18,090 --> 00:49:18,750
My speedrun!

1082
00:49:18,910 --> 00:49:20,390
Pizza flavored soda!

1083
00:49:20,690 --> 00:49:22,330
I don't even want a pecan!

1084
00:49:22,430 --> 00:49:23,670
Imagine how that tastes!

1085
00:49:23,970 --> 00:49:26,010
I almost forgot my speedrun!

1086
00:49:26,470 --> 00:49:27,570
My speedrun!

1087
00:49:28,830 --> 00:49:40,810
And then Pizza Hut did like a special promotion in Hong Kong where they're like, You can get super cheap pineapple on pizza!

1088
00:49:42,770 --> 00:49:44,370
Alright, out I go.

1089
00:49:46,010 --> 00:49:46,970
Alright, I'm here.

1090
00:49:47,530 --> 00:49:48,490
Have you ever...

1091
00:49:48,490 --> 00:49:50,490
Yo, have you ever played Pizza Roller, Oz?

1092
00:49:52,430 --> 00:49:55,450
Not Pizza Roller, but I've seen something like it.

1093
00:49:55,930 --> 00:49:58,650
This is the latest and greatest model from Fazbear.

1094
00:49:58,850 --> 00:49:59,930
So I'm not surprised.

1095
00:50:00,250 --> 00:50:02,370
Pretty exclusive stuff we got here.

1096
00:50:03,290 --> 00:50:03,850
What?

1097
00:50:04,630 --> 00:50:05,190
Fazbear?

1098
00:50:05,970 --> 00:50:06,530
Ha!

1099
00:50:06,770 --> 00:50:08,810
A kid who doesn't know about Fazbear?

1100
00:50:09,010 --> 00:50:10,510
You're a racket, dude.

1101
00:50:11,570 --> 00:50:12,130
Radical.

1102
00:50:12,810 --> 00:50:13,370
Here.

1103
00:50:13,530 --> 00:50:14,070
Here.

1104
00:50:14,150 --> 00:50:14,810
Grab a ball.

1105
00:50:14,810 --> 00:50:15,990
And we'll show you how to play.

1106
00:50:16,310 --> 00:50:18,730
You'll go up against me first.

1107
00:50:18,850 --> 00:50:20,090
And I'll go easy on ya.

1108
00:50:20,390 --> 00:50:20,830
Maybe.

1109
00:50:26,910 --> 00:50:27,350
Alright.

1110
00:50:28,670 --> 00:50:33,550
Okay, so the goal is to score as many points as possible by rolling the ball into the bullseye?

1111
00:50:34,250 --> 00:50:34,690
Okay.

1112
00:50:35,030 --> 00:50:37,130
Also, I upped the overall volume a little bit.

1113
00:50:37,250 --> 00:50:37,870
Sound guy.

1114
00:50:38,150 --> 00:50:38,770
How do I do that?

1115
00:50:39,010 --> 00:50:40,750
There's a ramp at the end that's gonna send...

1116
00:50:40,750 --> 00:50:41,490
Oh, a skee-ball!

1117
00:50:42,530 --> 00:50:44,210
Fazbear didn't invent skee-ball.

1118
00:50:47,490 --> 00:50:47,930
Oh.

1119
00:50:47,930 --> 00:50:48,510
Oh, a hundred.

1120
00:50:48,830 --> 00:50:49,590
Oh, that's hard.

1121
00:50:49,830 --> 00:50:51,170
Give it a try, Oz!

1122
00:50:52,610 --> 00:50:53,170
Okay.

1123
00:50:54,130 --> 00:50:54,690
Alright.

1124
00:50:56,050 --> 00:50:56,610
Oh!

1125
00:50:57,750 --> 00:50:58,770
I'm a natural!

1126
00:50:59,170 --> 00:50:59,510
Whoa!

1127
00:50:59,810 --> 00:51:00,630
Beginner's luck!

1128
00:51:01,210 --> 00:51:01,890
That's right.

1129
00:51:02,010 --> 00:51:02,690
I'm a gamer.

1130
00:51:03,110 --> 00:51:05,430
Bro, did you guys see that fucking 12-year-old kid?

1131
00:51:05,710 --> 00:51:06,410
That was...

1132
00:51:06,410 --> 00:51:08,070
That 12-year-old kid, he was like...

1133
00:51:08,070 --> 00:51:11,630
He got, like, top 500 on Fortnite at 9.

1134
00:51:11,930 --> 00:51:15,670
Top 5 Apex Predator at, like, 10.

1135
00:51:15,970 --> 00:51:16,910
And, like...

1136
00:51:16,910 --> 00:51:20,270
Radiant and Valorant at 12 years old.

1137
00:51:20,350 --> 00:51:21,030
That's me.

1138
00:51:22,890 --> 00:51:24,570
That's me, but at skee-ball.

1139
00:51:26,730 --> 00:51:27,270
Yeah!

1140
00:51:27,530 --> 00:51:33,030
There's a kid that got, like, Radiant and Valorant at fucking 12 years old!

1141
00:51:34,910 --> 00:51:37,790
And he was, like, Apex Predator at, like, 10.

1142
00:51:38,070 --> 00:51:41,390
And then, like, top 500 in Fortnite at, like, 9.

1143
00:51:41,710 --> 00:51:42,310
Bro, who...

1144
00:51:42,310 --> 00:51:42,910
What the fuck?

1145
00:51:44,910 --> 00:51:46,670
People were, like, wait, ban this kid.

1146
00:51:46,690 --> 00:51:47,610
He's not 13 yet.

1147
00:51:48,610 --> 00:51:49,730
That's so funny.

1148
00:51:50,490 --> 00:51:51,610
People were, like, wait a minute!

1149
00:51:51,890 --> 00:51:52,590
Ban him!

1150
00:51:53,330 --> 00:51:54,630
He's not 13 yet!

1151
00:51:54,770 --> 00:51:55,970
He shouldn't even be here!

1152
00:51:59,570 --> 00:52:01,010
He's, like, how dare you!

1153
00:52:05,210 --> 00:52:05,650
Okay.

1154
00:52:05,770 --> 00:52:06,390
I hit the wall.

1155
00:52:06,470 --> 00:52:07,050
Bouncy CS.

1156
00:52:07,070 --> 00:52:07,430
School?

1157
00:52:07,710 --> 00:52:09,070
Do you go to Westbrook, too?

1158
00:52:10,330 --> 00:52:11,130
Well, duh.

1159
00:52:11,850 --> 00:52:12,890
Westbrook is the only one.

1160
00:52:12,890 --> 00:52:14,050
Westbrook is the only school around here.

1161
00:52:16,090 --> 00:52:16,890
All right.

1162
00:52:17,130 --> 00:52:17,910
Let's see.

1163
00:52:18,010 --> 00:52:19,410
He's just trying to distract me.

1164
00:52:19,650 --> 00:52:20,030
No!

1165
00:52:23,630 --> 00:52:24,190
No!

1166
00:52:24,290 --> 00:52:25,550
And he beat it!

1167
00:52:25,710 --> 00:52:27,910
And he did distract me!

1168
00:52:29,610 --> 00:52:32,370
I hear we're gonna have a new teacher this year.

1169
00:52:32,810 --> 00:52:33,850
It worked!

1170
00:52:34,550 --> 00:52:37,070
I think her name is Ms. Nee-Chan.

1171
00:52:38,650 --> 00:52:39,210
No!

1172
00:52:41,250 --> 00:52:42,070
Let's pause.

1173
00:52:42,230 --> 00:52:42,870
Let's not.

1174
00:52:42,890 --> 00:52:43,990
Let's make it a good roll.

1175
00:52:45,750 --> 00:52:46,650
Oh, my God.

1176
00:52:46,670 --> 00:52:47,230
I can't believe.

1177
00:52:47,510 --> 00:52:48,130
Oh, yes!

1178
00:52:48,250 --> 00:52:49,490
I won my 10 points!

1179
00:52:49,630 --> 00:52:50,070
Let's go!

1180
00:52:51,810 --> 00:52:52,330
Wow.

1181
00:52:52,530 --> 00:52:53,870
Somebody beat me.

1182
00:52:55,490 --> 00:52:57,590
That was some fun rolling, Oz.

1183
00:53:00,810 --> 00:53:02,050
Fun science experiment.

1184
00:53:02,210 --> 00:53:07,310
Would a pineapple pizza hater spontaneously combust if given a bacon pineapple hot dog?

1185
00:53:07,490 --> 00:53:08,910
They give a super chat to your heart.

1186
00:53:08,990 --> 00:53:09,270
Thank you.

1187
00:53:09,370 --> 00:53:09,770
Thank you.

1188
00:53:09,850 --> 00:53:12,430
How about we play some tag instead?

1189
00:53:12,570 --> 00:53:12,870
Okay.

1190
00:53:13,490 --> 00:53:14,230
Oh, yeah.

1191
00:53:14,330 --> 00:53:17,370
That'll give us a chance to show Oz around the place.

1192
00:53:18,030 --> 00:53:18,570
Okay.

1193
00:53:18,630 --> 00:53:19,710
Which one is the nerd?

1194
00:53:20,110 --> 00:53:23,350
Like, which one is this guy?

1195
00:53:23,550 --> 00:53:26,410
I can't tell if this is Chip or this is Chip.

1196
00:53:26,590 --> 00:53:27,790
Or this is Mike.

1197
00:53:28,430 --> 00:53:30,310
I say sure.

1198
00:53:32,110 --> 00:53:32,650
Rad.

1199
00:53:33,770 --> 00:53:36,210
They're both nerds.

1200
00:53:36,290 --> 00:53:37,990
Yeah, but it's the 80s.

1201
00:53:37,990 --> 00:53:40,070
The one with the glasses is, like, super nerd.

1202
00:53:40,710 --> 00:53:41,250
Rad.

1203
00:53:41,350 --> 00:53:41,890
Rad.

1204
00:53:42,010 --> 00:53:42,870
I'll be it for sure.

1205
00:53:45,070 --> 00:53:46,310
Get ready to run.

1206
00:53:46,530 --> 00:53:47,610
Okay, so this is Chip.

1207
00:53:48,070 --> 00:53:49,330
Get ready to run.

1208
00:53:52,690 --> 00:53:53,650
Oh, shit.

1209
00:53:53,750 --> 00:53:54,530
Don't get caught.

1210
00:53:54,770 --> 00:53:55,510
Oh, shit.

1211
00:53:55,610 --> 00:53:56,670
I know what to do.

1212
00:53:56,910 --> 00:53:58,050
The door's locked.

1213
00:53:58,250 --> 00:53:58,410
No!

1214
00:53:58,690 --> 00:54:00,390
Now I don't know what to do!

1215
00:54:01,110 --> 00:54:02,490
I know what to do.

1216
00:54:03,350 --> 00:54:07,890
They can't catch me if I'm in the ball pit.

1217
00:54:08,290 --> 00:54:08,770
Oh.

1218
00:54:10,330 --> 00:54:10,810
Oh.

1219
00:54:11,310 --> 00:54:11,670
Oh.

1220
00:54:11,990 --> 00:54:12,470
Oh.

1221
00:54:12,470 --> 00:54:12,610
Oh.

1222
00:54:12,610 --> 00:54:12,870
Oh.

1223
00:54:12,870 --> 00:54:13,470
I got you!

1224
00:54:13,470 --> 00:54:14,390
I tripped!

1225
00:54:15,430 --> 00:54:16,930
How did I trip!

1226
00:54:17,210 --> 00:54:19,010
I got you!

1227
00:54:20,710 --> 00:54:21,270
What?!

1228
00:54:21,270 --> 00:54:28,330
I was like, if it's gonna do me!

1229
00:54:29,310 --> 00:54:31,790
I can't believe I tripped!

1230
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:35,310
This place is packed today.

1231
00:54:35,570 --> 00:54:38,250
I feel like I couldn't outrun you at all, Chip!

1232
00:54:40,490 --> 00:54:41,790
I think I'm making the night.

1233
00:54:42,050 --> 00:54:42,850
Everyone's gonna get in there.

1234
00:54:42,870 --> 00:54:47,390
How about hide and seek then?

1235
00:54:48,830 --> 00:54:51,350
Now that's a game I'm good at.

1236
00:54:52,150 --> 00:54:53,190
You're on.

1237
00:54:54,310 --> 00:54:54,910
Okay.

1238
00:54:55,210 --> 00:54:55,810
Okay.

1239
00:54:55,850 --> 00:54:56,590
This time.

1240
00:54:57,370 --> 00:54:59,790
This time I can hide in the ball pit.

1241
00:55:00,030 --> 00:55:00,630
Right?

1242
00:55:01,670 --> 00:55:03,830
There's no way I can't hide here.

1243
00:55:04,170 --> 00:55:04,450
No!

1244
00:55:05,370 --> 00:55:05,970
No!

1245
00:55:06,450 --> 00:55:07,910
Where do I hide?

1246
00:55:10,290 --> 00:55:11,410
Give me a sec.

1247
00:55:12,510 --> 00:55:14,090
No, it's still locked.

1248
00:55:14,130 --> 00:55:15,170
Where do I hide?

1249
00:55:17,490 --> 00:55:18,850
Everything is locked.

1250
00:55:22,190 --> 00:55:23,210
It's not fair.

1251
00:55:24,110 --> 00:55:25,490
Everything is locked.

1252
00:55:25,710 --> 00:55:27,250
Where do you hide?

1253
00:55:29,310 --> 00:55:29,830
Okay.

1254
00:55:30,490 --> 00:55:31,590
Maybe in the arcade?

1255
00:55:32,690 --> 00:55:34,410
Is there a hiding spot in the arcade?

1256
00:55:36,610 --> 00:55:38,070
Oh, oh, here, here, here.

1257
00:55:38,890 --> 00:55:39,630
Oh, no.

1258
00:55:39,630 --> 00:55:40,710
Maybe here.

1259
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:45,880
Oh, an empty suit.

1260
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:47,120
Oh, it wasn't even timed.

1261
00:55:47,540 --> 00:55:49,400
I bet they never check in there.

1262
00:55:54,780 --> 00:55:56,140
June 1985?

1263
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:02,000
This really is just like the movie.

1264
00:56:03,140 --> 00:56:04,260
I hear footsteps.

1265
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:05,160
Better hide.

1266
00:56:09,580 --> 00:56:10,260
Oh.

1267
00:56:11,140 --> 00:56:11,820
Hungry?

1268
00:56:11,860 --> 00:56:12,500
Order now.

1269
00:56:15,420 --> 00:56:17,860
Wait, the tripping is random?

1270
00:56:19,980 --> 00:56:21,200
I need to grab it.

1271
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:27,440
I can't believe I tripped on the one time I needed to run.

1272
00:56:27,980 --> 00:56:30,000
The mirror shows how much noise you're making.

1273
00:56:30,100 --> 00:56:30,660
Stay quiet.

1274
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:32,440
Wait, does it track my mic?

1275
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:35,260
I hope mic didn't hear that.

1276
00:56:35,580 --> 00:56:36,740
Gotta hide fast.

1277
00:56:39,340 --> 00:56:39,940
Okay.

1278
00:56:43,180 --> 00:56:45,020
Wouldn't it be funny if that kid dies?

1279
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:46,980
In game.

1280
00:56:48,860 --> 00:56:53,580
I'm trying to like... trying to fucking open my tissue box.

1281
00:56:54,740 --> 00:56:55,340
Alright.

1282
00:56:55,340 --> 00:56:56,260
There you go.

1283
00:56:57,300 --> 00:56:59,800
Nice try, but I can hear ya, chit.

1284
00:57:03,310 --> 00:57:04,750
Where did you... whatever.

1285
00:57:05,110 --> 00:57:06,370
Did you find Oz yet?

1286
00:57:07,350 --> 00:57:08,190
Not yet.

1287
00:57:08,270 --> 00:57:10,050
He's quiet, unlike you.

1288
00:57:11,630 --> 00:57:13,850
Well, maybe I'll find him.

1289
00:57:13,850 --> 00:57:14,310
I'll find him first.

1290
00:57:15,670 --> 00:57:17,770
Guys, he can't vent yet.

1291
00:57:17,930 --> 00:57:18,590
Among Us...

1292
00:57:20,690 --> 00:57:22,810
Among Us hasn't been invented yet, guys.

1293
00:57:25,410 --> 00:57:26,930
They'll never find me.

1294
00:57:32,010 --> 00:57:32,770
Oh, shit.

1295
00:57:55,300 --> 00:57:58,840
Oh, I didn't realize I was supposed to not breathe.

1296
00:57:59,140 --> 00:58:01,360
I was like, hey, what's that?

1297
00:58:01,360 --> 00:58:04,520
I thought I was a cutsy.

1298
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:08,000
I thought I was a cutsy.

1299
00:58:08,100 --> 00:58:08,720
I was like, whoa.

1300
00:58:09,640 --> 00:58:11,220
What's he doing there?

1301
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:19,980
What on earth was that thing?

1302
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:22,520
Glad he didn't see me.

1303
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:25,720
Probably not supposed to be back there.

1304
00:58:25,720 --> 00:58:26,000
Here.

1305
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:29,960
Whoa.

1306
00:58:31,420 --> 00:58:32,540
What's going on?

1307
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:39,440
Scared woman?

1308
00:58:39,620 --> 00:58:40,800
Oh my god, there's the parents!

1309
00:58:42,180 --> 00:58:42,760
Grab

1310
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:46,640
the kids!

1311
00:58:47,480 --> 00:58:49,860
I don't want anybody to think about the children!

1312
00:58:52,260 --> 00:58:52,840
Hello?

1313
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:53,700
Hello?

1314
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:55,420
Anyone there?

1315
00:58:56,960 --> 00:58:57,540
Chip?

1316
00:58:57,860 --> 00:58:58,440
Mike?

1317
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:01,780
Crap.

1318
00:59:01,780 --> 00:59:02,820
Yelling is useless.

1319
00:59:03,080 --> 00:59:04,380
Too many people screaming.

1320
00:59:05,300 --> 00:59:06,340
Where are they?

1321
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:08,360
Maybe they know what's going on.

1322
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:10,360
Come on!

1323
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:13,900
No, it's locked.

1324
00:59:13,980 --> 00:59:15,140
Something is blocking it.

1325
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:16,240
Okay.

1326
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:17,440
Can I go here?

1327
00:59:17,740 --> 00:59:18,900
It won't budge.

1328
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:20,380
I'll just hide.

1329
00:59:25,060 --> 00:59:26,700
How is there still people screaming?

1330
00:59:27,620 --> 00:59:28,100
Hello?

1331
00:59:29,560 --> 00:59:31,600
Oh, it looks like one of those sliding puzzles.

1332
00:59:33,120 --> 00:59:34,440
I think I need a game token.

1333
00:59:34,660 --> 00:59:36,100
Oh, can I grab game tokens?

1334
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:39,680
Oh wait, I'm going to grab some game tokens.

1335
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:43,300
Wait, how do I get the game tokens though?

1336
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:45,360
I want to play some games.

1337
00:59:50,050 --> 00:59:50,630
Hello?

1338
00:59:52,710 --> 00:59:54,070
Should I just leave?

1339
00:59:54,370 --> 00:59:54,830
Yes.

1340
00:59:56,270 --> 00:59:56,850
Yes.

1341
00:59:58,630 --> 00:59:59,590
Did I win?

1342
01:00:00,590 --> 01:00:01,930
Where do I go?

1343
01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:03,770
What do I do?

1344
01:00:06,430 --> 01:00:07,010
Bye.

1345
01:00:07,010 --> 01:00:08,950
I did it.

1346
01:00:10,370 --> 01:00:11,670
I won the game.

1347
01:00:19,390 --> 01:00:19,910
What?

1348
01:00:21,170 --> 01:00:22,050
What the fuck?

1349
01:00:22,170 --> 01:00:22,830
Why would I say?

1350
01:00:23,790 --> 01:00:26,550
I am the person that lives in horror games.

1351
01:00:33,630 --> 01:00:34,670
Wait, what?

1352
01:00:35,190 --> 01:00:36,990
Guys, and this is why I hope you enjoyed this video.

1353
01:00:37,010 --> 01:00:43,150
I am the person that... I am the person that would survive in a horror... in a horror movie.

1354
01:00:43,610 --> 01:00:45,410
I literally would... I don't care.

1355
01:00:45,550 --> 01:00:49,090
I don't care if my best friend is like trapped in there.

1356
01:00:49,370 --> 01:00:49,930
I...

1357
01:00:53,370 --> 01:00:55,070
If I know I...

1358
01:00:55,070 --> 01:00:58,530
Guys, what's the point of going back to die?

1359
01:00:59,330 --> 01:01:00,830
One of us should survive.

1360
01:01:01,450 --> 01:01:03,210
One of us needed to survive.

1361
01:01:04,070 --> 01:01:04,630
Alright?

1362
01:01:08,250 --> 01:01:10,310
Oh my god, we did it everybody!

1363
01:01:10,770 --> 01:01:12,550
We beat FNAF!

1364
01:01:12,950 --> 01:01:13,970
Holy shit!

1365
01:01:17,010 --> 01:01:19,950
All I'm saying is that...

1366
01:01:20,690 --> 01:01:22,470
Guys, like what's the point?

1367
01:01:22,570 --> 01:01:24,950
If we both die, then what's the point?

1368
01:01:25,110 --> 01:01:27,090
Might as well have somebody survive.

1369
01:01:28,570 --> 01:01:30,050
Darkblade, thank you for the super chat.

1370
01:01:30,130 --> 01:01:30,870
Thank you, thank you.

1371
01:01:30,970 --> 01:01:31,990
She beat it!

1372
01:01:32,010 --> 01:01:32,410
Let's go!

1373
01:01:32,830 --> 01:01:33,350
Congrats!

1374
01:01:34,270 --> 01:01:35,430
Gamer of the year!

1375
01:01:35,890 --> 01:01:36,990
Thank you for the super chat.

1376
01:01:37,010 --> 01:01:37,590
Thank you!

1377
01:01:37,730 --> 01:01:39,610
I liked how the game was like...

1378
01:01:39,610 --> 01:01:41,870
Was like, are you sure you want to leave?

1379
01:01:42,010 --> 01:01:43,350
And I had zero hesitation.

1380
01:01:43,850 --> 01:01:44,810
I was like, yes.

1381
01:01:49,070 --> 01:01:50,870
Okay, let's play...

1382
01:01:50,870 --> 01:01:52,970
It's okay, let's not leave.

1383
01:01:53,990 --> 01:01:55,930
Okay guys, let's...

1384
01:01:57,610 --> 01:01:59,770
I love how it's like, are you sure?

1385
01:02:02,770 --> 01:02:03,770
Alright, confirmed.

1386
01:02:07,170 --> 01:02:08,630
Alright, here we go.

1387
01:02:08,710 --> 01:02:11,110
Let's not leave this time.

1388
01:02:12,310 --> 01:02:15,250
Sandy, welcome to Tomato Farm.

1389
01:02:15,350 --> 01:02:15,970
Welcome, welcome.

1390
01:02:17,630 --> 01:02:19,050
Alright, down we go.

1391
01:02:20,310 --> 01:02:22,210
I mean, everybody else was running out.

1392
01:02:22,350 --> 01:02:23,770
Of course I was gonna follow them.

1393
01:02:23,970 --> 01:02:25,490
Everybody else ran out.

1394
01:02:25,590 --> 01:02:27,270
Why would I go into danger?

1395
01:02:27,870 --> 01:02:30,270
They're clearly running away from danger.

1396
01:02:30,510 --> 01:02:31,770
Why would I go?

1397
01:02:31,970 --> 01:02:32,910
This is why I'm...

1398
01:02:32,910 --> 01:02:34,010
This is so stupid.

1399
01:02:34,090 --> 01:02:35,150
Like, look, they're all running away!

1400
01:02:36,950 --> 01:02:38,530
They're all running away!

1401
01:02:40,350 --> 01:02:43,030
Why would I go back into danger?

1402
01:02:44,790 --> 01:02:45,430
Hello?

1403
01:02:48,670 --> 01:02:49,310
Hey.

1404
01:02:50,530 --> 01:02:51,750
Come with me?

1405
01:02:52,270 --> 01:02:53,510
If I want to live?

1406
01:02:53,790 --> 01:02:54,070
Okay.

1407
01:02:55,190 --> 01:02:57,910
Let me follow the scary rabbit guy.

1408
01:02:58,150 --> 01:03:00,210
Into like, the room of danger.

1409
01:03:00,870 --> 01:03:02,790
Is it asking me to follow it?

1410
01:03:03,030 --> 01:03:04,810
Maybe it has Chip and Mike.

1411
01:03:08,500 --> 01:03:08,860
What?

1412
01:03:09,340 --> 01:03:10,120
What the fuck was that?

1413
01:03:11,140 --> 01:03:11,500
Hello?

1414
01:03:13,100 --> 01:03:13,760
What is that?

1415
01:03:15,060 --> 01:03:15,880
Someone has to...

1416
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:16,020
Yeah!

1417
01:03:16,100 --> 01:03:17,540
Someone has to live to tell a story!

1418
01:03:17,600 --> 01:03:19,520
And then I can sell the rights to my story!

1419
01:03:21,320 --> 01:03:22,580
Thank you for the super chat, Aura!

1420
01:03:22,660 --> 01:03:22,860
Thank you!

1421
01:03:25,620 --> 01:03:28,720
There's no way someone ate two pizzas while running out of here.

1422
01:03:29,080 --> 01:03:29,440
Creepy!

1423
01:03:30,500 --> 01:03:33,900
Okay, that is not what we should be, like, focusing on.

1424
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:36,020
Wait, where do I go?

1425
01:03:36,380 --> 01:03:37,160
Like, here?

1426
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:39,300
Why can't I run now?

1427
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:41,100
Was he here?

1428
01:03:42,120 --> 01:03:43,680
I need to follow that thing.

1429
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:44,640
Oh, this was where...

1430
01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:46,640
I'm sorry, I couldn't tell where he went.

1431
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:48,620
There's so many doors.

1432
01:03:52,080 --> 01:03:52,600
Hello?

1433
01:03:53,380 --> 01:03:53,900
Whoa!

1434
01:03:55,580 --> 01:03:57,200
Oh shit, not hello!

1435
01:03:57,720 --> 01:03:58,240
Okay.

1436
01:03:59,380 --> 01:03:59,900
Goodbye.

1437
01:04:01,380 --> 01:04:01,900
Goodbye.

1438
01:04:01,900 --> 01:04:02,160
Goodbye!

1439
01:04:04,900 --> 01:04:07,260
There you go.

1440
01:04:10,360 --> 01:04:11,220
Where is he?

1441
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:14,660
Wait, escape?

1442
01:04:17,260 --> 01:04:19,300
There's no way he can look under the table.

1443
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:21,520
Right?

1444
01:04:26,980 --> 01:04:27,500
Hello?

1445
01:04:31,160 --> 01:04:33,440
Is he just gonna stand here and cat me?

1446
01:04:34,220 --> 01:04:34,740
Goodbye.

1447
01:04:38,600 --> 01:04:39,200
Is...

1448
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:40,260
Is it gone?

1449
01:04:41,960 --> 01:04:43,440
I gotta get out of here.

1450
01:04:43,560 --> 01:04:44,880
Hope, Chip, and Mike are okay?

1451
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:46,580
Can I just leave now?

1452
01:04:48,900 --> 01:04:49,780
Alright, goodbye.

1453
01:04:51,380 --> 01:04:53,020
Oh, I need to find them?

1454
01:04:53,140 --> 01:04:54,860
I literally just met them!

1455
01:04:55,740 --> 01:04:56,340
I...

1456
01:04:56,340 --> 01:04:57,180
I...

1457
01:04:57,180 --> 01:04:59,460
I beat them in Arcade and that's it!

1458
01:05:00,300 --> 01:05:01,420
That's literally it!

1459
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:04,080
They have no...

1460
01:05:04,080 --> 01:05:04,920
Oh.

1461
01:05:05,380 --> 01:05:06,640
Oh, they're freaking angry.

1462
01:05:07,460 --> 01:05:09,580
Oh my god, he has like blood eyes.

1463
01:05:09,940 --> 01:05:11,040
They're a little freaky.

1464
01:05:12,500 --> 01:05:14,660
They're doing some freaky dances now.

1465
01:05:16,600 --> 01:05:17,900
Can I hide in the ball pit?

1466
01:05:18,100 --> 01:05:18,820
Oh, I'm getting chased.

1467
01:05:26,510 --> 01:05:27,450
There he is.

1468
01:05:29,050 --> 01:05:31,750
Oh, there's a FNAF thing in the background!

1469
01:05:33,210 --> 01:05:33,730
Oswald!

1470
01:05:33,950 --> 01:05:35,090
What were you thinking?

1471
01:05:35,990 --> 01:05:37,710
Hiding that nasty old thing!

1472
01:05:38,230 --> 01:05:39,670
Didn't you hear me calling you?

1473
01:05:42,010 --> 01:05:42,530
Dad!

1474
01:05:42,790 --> 01:05:43,590
Dad, no!

1475
01:05:49,780 --> 01:05:51,000
At least I still have mom.

1476
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:54,080
Oh, shit.

1477
01:05:56,020 --> 01:05:56,540
Jeff?

1478
01:06:03,780 --> 01:06:04,620
What the fuck?

1479
01:06:04,700 --> 01:06:05,120
What am I pulling?

1480
01:06:06,360 --> 01:06:06,880
Dad?

1481
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:08,180
Wait, what?

1482
01:06:11,910 --> 01:06:13,050
Dad, did you see that?

1483
01:06:14,370 --> 01:06:15,910
Jeff's my new dad now.

1484
01:06:16,670 --> 01:06:17,550
Dad, are you...

1485
01:06:17,550 --> 01:06:19,930
No, he got spring-trapped!

1486
01:06:20,050 --> 01:06:20,570
Wait, what?

1487
01:06:20,590 --> 01:06:22,630
Wait, that's not dad!

1488
01:06:24,570 --> 01:06:26,350
Dad, are you okay?

1489
01:06:31,560 --> 01:06:33,160
Come on, son.

1490
01:06:38,700 --> 01:06:40,380
Have a good night, guys.

1491
01:06:41,180 --> 01:06:42,240
Wait, Jeff!

1492
01:06:42,320 --> 01:06:44,200
I think something's wrong with dad!

1493
01:06:45,020 --> 01:06:48,520
I don't think grown men are supposed to have glowing eyes!

1494
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:53,080
You look different there, dad.

1495
01:06:55,080 --> 01:06:57,080
Did you get a new haircut?

1496
01:06:58,440 --> 01:06:59,940
He looks fine to me.

1497
01:07:00,220 --> 01:07:01,820
That's probably...

1498
01:07:01,820 --> 01:07:04,060
He's gonna start calling you boy.

1499
01:07:04,700 --> 01:07:06,540
That's probably gone to your head.

1500
01:07:06,780 --> 01:07:08,140
Go home and relax.

1501
01:07:10,280 --> 01:07:11,180
Wait, wait!

1502
01:07:17,850 --> 01:07:18,830
Jeff, please!

1503
01:07:22,050 --> 01:07:22,910
Oswald's house.

1504
01:07:23,230 --> 01:07:24,150
Night one.

1505
01:07:24,590 --> 01:07:26,370
The longer Oswald...

1506
01:07:26,370 --> 01:07:28,110
What did you do to my dad?

1507
01:07:28,110 --> 01:07:30,250
Where are you taking me?

1508
01:07:33,390 --> 01:07:35,570
How do you even know how to...

1509
01:07:35,570 --> 01:07:38,570
How do you even know how to drive?

1510
01:07:39,470 --> 01:07:40,750
What the...

1511
01:07:41,550 --> 01:07:43,810
Oh, that's creepy.

1512
01:07:44,230 --> 01:07:45,550
That's actually creepy.

1513
01:07:46,110 --> 01:07:47,310
My house?

1514
01:07:47,570 --> 01:07:49,030
Wait, how do you know where I live?

1515
01:07:49,390 --> 01:07:50,790
Wait, that's fucked up!

1516
01:07:51,770 --> 01:07:52,930
How did you know?

1517
01:07:53,190 --> 01:07:54,490
You a doxer?

1518
01:08:08,680 --> 01:08:10,300
Is he gonna bang my...

1519
01:08:14,020 --> 01:08:16,420
I'll just be going to my room for the night now, okay?

1520
01:08:17,780 --> 01:08:20,420
DMV gave this animatronic a license.

1521
01:08:29,020 --> 01:08:29,920
What's happening?

1522
01:08:30,400 --> 01:08:31,620
What should I do?

1523
01:08:31,660 --> 01:08:35,300
Oh my god, why do I have drawings of the FNAF characters?

1524
01:08:36,440 --> 01:08:37,820
Oh, I'll call mom!

1525
01:08:38,420 --> 01:08:39,760
He used the force!

1526
01:08:39,800 --> 01:08:40,500
I knew it!

1527
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:42,160
Maybe she'll know what to do.

1528
01:08:42,700 --> 01:08:44,780
Dad always leaves his cell phone at home.

1529
01:08:45,040 --> 01:08:46,240
I bet it's in his room.

1530
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:49,440
Okay.

1531
01:08:50,660 --> 01:08:52,020
Alright, we gotta...

1532
01:08:52,020 --> 01:08:54,900
Dad got me this lava lamp from the yard sale.

1533
01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:55,800
Pretty retro.

1534
01:08:55,840 --> 01:08:56,760
I thought it was cool.

1535
01:08:57,580 --> 01:08:58,960
Bro, what the fuck do I...

1536
01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:01,180
Oh, I have to hide under my bed too.

1537
01:09:02,860 --> 01:09:03,300
Okay.

1538
01:09:04,260 --> 01:09:05,720
Okay, so like...

1539
01:09:05,720 --> 01:09:07,140
And why didn't he kill me right away?

1540
01:09:07,140 --> 01:09:10,940
He could've easily left me out to die in the middle of the street.

1541
01:09:11,220 --> 01:09:13,080
Why would I need to hide now?

1542
01:09:14,060 --> 01:09:16,160
Thank you for the 10 gifted chips!

1543
01:09:16,320 --> 01:09:16,520
Thank you!

1544
01:09:19,980 --> 01:09:20,480
Okay.

1545
01:09:21,220 --> 01:09:22,480
Where's my dad's room?

1546
01:09:23,340 --> 01:09:25,660
Is this where my dad lives?

1547
01:09:26,820 --> 01:09:27,700
Hallway 1.

1548
01:09:28,060 --> 01:09:28,980
Oh, master bedroom.

1549
01:09:29,320 --> 01:09:29,640
Okay.

1550
01:09:29,740 --> 01:09:30,440
I need to go back.

1551
01:09:30,700 --> 01:09:31,800
Guys, I'm reading the map.

1552
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:32,280
I'm learning.

1553
01:09:33,220 --> 01:09:33,720
Okay.

1554
01:09:35,180 --> 01:09:35,680
Dad?

1555
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:38,320
Dad?

1556
01:09:39,440 --> 01:09:39,580
Dad?

1557
01:09:40,500 --> 01:09:40,960
Dad?

1558
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:42,560
Dad?

1559
01:09:42,860 --> 01:09:43,200
Hello?

1560
01:09:43,200 --> 01:09:45,020
I saw dad's phone on the lights down.

1561
01:09:45,180 --> 01:09:47,800
I need to find a way to make that thing leave first.

1562
01:09:48,120 --> 01:09:49,300
He's like, oh my god.

1563
01:09:49,460 --> 01:09:51,280
The only reason he like...

1564
01:09:51,280 --> 01:09:56,960
He like transferred his soul into his body is so he can experience a bed for the first time.

1565
01:10:01,980 --> 01:10:03,200
He's like, oh my god.

1566
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:05,220
I haven't had a bed since 1945.

1567
01:10:06,180 --> 01:10:06,960
He's like, oh my god.

1568
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:07,080
I haven't had a bed since 1945.

1569
01:10:07,900 --> 01:10:08,440
He's like, oh my god.

1570
01:10:08,440 --> 01:10:08,780
I haven't had a bed since 1945.

1571
01:10:08,780 --> 01:10:10,620
I can start it with a loud noise.

1572
01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:14,160
He's so... he's so tired.

1573
01:10:15,530 --> 01:10:16,680
I guess the sewing machine.

1574
01:10:16,940 --> 01:10:18,100
That should be loud enough.

1575
01:10:19,100 --> 01:10:19,640
Alright.

1576
01:10:26,010 --> 01:10:26,550
Hello?

1577
01:10:27,470 --> 01:10:28,590
What could that be?

1578
01:10:31,390 --> 01:10:31,930
Kringo!

1579
01:10:32,030 --> 01:10:33,290
Thank you for the magenta soup!

1580
01:10:33,350 --> 01:10:34,130
Thank you!

1581
01:10:34,250 --> 01:10:34,770
Thank you!

1582
01:10:34,830 --> 01:10:36,210
Here's the doki on my birthday.

1583
01:10:36,330 --> 01:10:37,650
Hope to aka next year!

1584
01:10:38,030 --> 01:10:39,790
Happy birthday to you!

1585
01:10:40,090 --> 01:10:41,830
Happy birthday to you!

1586
01:10:41,830 --> 01:10:43,870
Happy birthday dear Kringo!

1587
01:10:44,090 --> 01:10:45,450
Happy birthday to you!

1588
01:10:45,590 --> 01:10:45,870
Yeah!

1589
01:10:46,590 --> 01:10:49,330
Now it's time to steal dad's phone and call mom.

1590
01:10:50,270 --> 01:10:50,990
Happy birthday!

1591
01:10:51,350 --> 01:10:52,410
Is that the phone?

1592
01:10:52,770 --> 01:10:53,810
That has to be the phone, right?

1593
01:10:54,450 --> 01:10:55,150
Oh shit.

1594
01:10:55,330 --> 01:10:56,890
Alright, let me call her right now.

1595
01:10:57,590 --> 01:10:58,370
Where are the numbers?

1596
01:10:58,450 --> 01:11:00,050
Does dad still just remember them all?

1597
01:11:00,290 --> 01:11:01,070
Fucking 911.

1598
01:11:02,590 --> 01:11:03,450
What the fuck?

1599
01:11:04,650 --> 01:11:06,530
Mom's number should be written somewhere in the house.

1600
01:11:06,590 --> 01:11:07,270
Just call 911!

1601
01:11:08,430 --> 01:11:09,330
What the fuck?

1602
01:11:12,900 --> 01:11:15,480
Did I not teach my kid?

1603
01:11:15,800 --> 01:11:18,700
Dad didn't teach the kid to fucking call 911?

1604
01:11:19,140 --> 01:11:21,120
He gets three numbers!

1605
01:11:23,420 --> 01:11:25,200
It's literally three numbers!

1606
01:11:27,940 --> 01:11:29,540
Dad of the year.

1607
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:32,140
Apparently my parents didn't teach me how to call 911.

1608
01:11:33,560 --> 01:11:34,640
Like, okay.

1609
01:11:34,780 --> 01:11:35,380
Let's see.

1610
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:37,540
555-5683.

1611
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:40,020
Okay, five...

1612
01:11:40,020 --> 01:11:40,800
Oh!

1613
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:41,580
Wait.

1614
01:11:42,260 --> 01:11:43,320
Nine-nine...

1615
01:11:43,320 --> 01:11:43,420
Oh!

1616
01:11:43,780 --> 01:11:46,060
Okay guys, I was just very stupid.

1617
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:47,220
Nine...

1618
01:11:47,220 --> 01:11:47,740
Wait.

1619
01:11:48,820 --> 01:11:49,760
Wait, I...

1620
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:50,680
What?

1621
01:11:50,920 --> 01:11:51,500
I...

1622
01:11:51,500 --> 01:11:51,740
I...

1623
01:11:51,740 --> 01:11:53,540
I called 991.

1624
01:11:53,760 --> 01:11:54,320
I...

1625
01:11:56,520 --> 01:11:57,640
I'm sorry.

1626
01:11:57,940 --> 01:11:58,300
No!

1627
01:11:58,440 --> 01:11:59,380
That's not what I meant!

1628
01:11:59,620 --> 01:12:01,180
I'm messing it up!

1629
01:12:01,620 --> 01:12:01,880
Oh!

1630
01:12:02,180 --> 01:12:02,760
Okay.

1631
01:12:02,920 --> 01:12:03,540
Okay, okay.

1632
01:12:05,320 --> 01:12:06,560
Okay, there we go.

1633
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:08,180
Hello!

1634
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:09,220
Please!

1635
01:12:11,580 --> 01:12:14,920
Unfortunately, 911 services happened.

1636
01:12:15,280 --> 01:12:16,680
Wait, is that illegal?

1637
01:12:17,200 --> 01:12:19,920
I've been suspended in your area.

1638
01:12:20,080 --> 01:12:22,560
Not too poor for the police?

1639
01:12:23,420 --> 01:12:25,780
Please call your local police station.

1640
01:12:26,420 --> 01:12:28,200
This is an emergency!

1641
01:12:28,540 --> 01:12:31,600
What the fuck is the local police station number?

1642
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:33,240
Well...

1643
01:12:33,240 --> 01:12:34,700
That's great.

1644
01:12:36,440 --> 01:12:36,860
Alright.

1645
01:12:37,140 --> 01:12:38,520
Who you gonna call?

1646
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:40,280
Okay.

1647
01:12:40,420 --> 01:12:41,920
555-5683.

1648
01:12:42,220 --> 01:12:42,960
Okay.

1649
01:12:43,040 --> 01:12:46,000
555-568...

1650
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:47,140
No!

1651
01:12:48,280 --> 01:12:49,040
Okay.

1652
01:12:49,720 --> 01:12:50,480
83.

1653
01:12:50,660 --> 01:12:51,180
There we go.

1654
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:52,820
Hello, Mom!

1655
01:12:56,980 --> 01:12:57,740
Hello?

1656
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:02,420
Mom, it's an emergency!

1657
01:13:03,520 --> 01:13:05,200
What's going on, sweetie?

1658
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:08,700
It's Zed!

1659
01:13:09,360 --> 01:13:10,300
Something's wrong!

1660
01:13:11,440 --> 01:13:12,200
What's going on?

1661
01:13:12,220 --> 01:13:12,340
Okay.

1662
01:13:12,340 --> 01:13:12,980
I'll be right there.

1663
01:13:13,140 --> 01:13:13,420
Wait.

1664
01:13:13,480 --> 01:13:14,640
What's the Ghostbusters number?

1665
01:13:14,940 --> 01:13:17,220
Oh, shit!

1666
01:13:18,440 --> 01:13:19,300
Oh, shit!

1667
01:13:20,060 --> 01:13:20,860
Oh, shit!

1668
01:13:20,900 --> 01:13:21,420
The closet!

1669
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:22,960
The closet never fucks up!

1670
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:25,400
Woo!

1671
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:28,520
Woo!

1672
01:13:34,100 --> 01:13:34,620
Okay.

1673
01:13:38,820 --> 01:13:39,560
We're good.

1674
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:42,360
Oh.

1675
01:13:43,140 --> 01:13:43,660
Wait.

1676
01:13:43,660 --> 01:13:43,740
Wait.

1677
01:13:43,740 --> 01:13:44,360
Where do we meet Mom?

1678
01:13:48,220 --> 01:13:49,120
That must be Mom.

1679
01:13:49,660 --> 01:13:50,080
That's Mom!

1680
01:13:50,460 --> 01:13:50,820
Wait.

1681
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:51,060
What?

1682
01:13:51,380 --> 01:13:52,180
That must be Mom!

1683
01:13:53,720 --> 01:13:54,080
Wait.

1684
01:13:54,100 --> 01:13:54,420
Where's Mom?

1685
01:13:55,580 --> 01:13:56,500
Where the fuck's Mom?

1686
01:13:56,720 --> 01:13:57,060
Do I...

1687
01:13:57,060 --> 01:13:57,520
Do I...

1688
01:13:57,520 --> 01:13:58,640
Go to the living room?

1689
01:14:01,200 --> 01:14:01,780
Oh, outside!

1690
01:14:01,940 --> 01:14:02,120
Okay.

1691
01:14:02,860 --> 01:14:03,220
Okay.

1692
01:14:03,260 --> 01:14:04,200
We gotta make it.

1693
01:14:05,100 --> 01:14:05,460
Okay.

1694
01:14:06,220 --> 01:14:06,580
Oh.

1695
01:14:07,160 --> 01:14:07,680
Oh, my God.

1696
01:14:07,680 --> 01:14:08,800
These jump scares are so good.

1697
01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:11,700
Oh, God.

1698
01:14:11,780 --> 01:14:12,160
Oh, God.

1699
01:14:12,180 --> 01:14:12,520
Oh, God.

1700
01:14:12,520 --> 01:14:13,140
We don't hesitate.

1701
01:14:13,900 --> 01:14:14,720
We don't care.

1702
01:14:14,840 --> 01:14:15,200
We don't care.

1703
01:14:15,220 --> 01:14:16,060
Mom!

1704
01:14:16,380 --> 01:14:17,140
You're a doctor?

1705
01:14:17,580 --> 01:14:17,800
How...

1706
01:14:24,840 --> 01:14:26,660
Can that replace?

1707
01:14:27,260 --> 01:14:29,280
Is this some kind of prank, Oswald?

1708
01:14:30,240 --> 01:14:31,500
Dad looks fine.

1709
01:14:31,920 --> 01:14:36,200
You should look no better than to fake an emergency while I'm at work.

1710
01:14:39,460 --> 01:14:39,880
But...

1711
01:14:39,880 --> 01:14:40,460
But...

1712
01:14:40,460 --> 01:14:41,680
Can you see it?

1713
01:14:42,480 --> 01:14:44,340
I see that Dad is fine.

1714
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:47,060
I don't know what's gotten into you.

1715
01:14:47,580 --> 01:14:49,660
But go to your room and calm down.

1716
01:14:49,960 --> 01:14:51,280
I'll get back to the hospital.

1717
01:14:51,400 --> 01:14:52,740
But Dad's not even talking!

1718
01:14:53,040 --> 01:14:53,600
Mom!

1719
01:14:55,800 --> 01:14:57,200
Dad's not even talking!

1720
01:14:57,340 --> 01:14:57,660
Mom!

1721
01:15:04,260 --> 01:15:04,740
Oh.

1722
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:07,140
It's all up to me, I guess.

1723
01:15:08,140 --> 01:15:10,380
Dad has to be stuck in the ball pit.

1724
01:15:10,620 --> 01:15:11,940
I gotta get back to...

1725
01:15:11,940 --> 01:15:14,000
How the fuck am I gonna get back to Jeff's?

1726
01:15:14,060 --> 01:15:14,680
I can't drive.

1727
01:15:14,920 --> 01:15:16,240
I'm like a child.

1728
01:15:17,300 --> 01:15:17,780
Okay.

1729
01:15:17,840 --> 01:15:19,140
Find a way to escape.

1730
01:15:19,400 --> 01:15:20,340
Is this just not the door?

1731
01:15:21,680 --> 01:15:22,160
Like...

1732
01:15:24,640 --> 01:15:27,380
He's just standing there menacingly.

1733
01:15:28,540 --> 01:15:29,020
Like...

1734
01:15:29,020 --> 01:15:29,480
Oh, my God.

1735
01:15:29,500 --> 01:15:31,180
Where the fuck...

1736
01:15:32,740 --> 01:15:33,600
Where do I...

1737
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:34,640
Where do I go?

1738
01:15:35,220 --> 01:15:36,320
Go through the window?

1739
01:15:36,660 --> 01:15:37,820
Do I have a window?

1740
01:15:38,700 --> 01:15:39,560
Oh, I do.

1741
01:15:39,800 --> 01:15:41,480
The latch is rusted shut.

1742
01:15:41,700 --> 01:15:43,880
I think I can still unscrew the bolts.

1743
01:15:44,300 --> 01:15:46,160
Gotta find a screwdriver.

1744
01:15:46,640 --> 01:15:49,960
We all know there is a screwdriver in the attic.

1745
01:15:50,400 --> 01:15:50,960
Right?

1746
01:15:51,240 --> 01:15:51,960
I don't...

1747
01:15:51,960 --> 01:15:53,640
I don't fucking know.

1748
01:15:55,460 --> 01:15:56,540
There has to be a...

1749
01:15:56,540 --> 01:15:56,780
No!

1750
01:15:56,840 --> 01:15:57,680
In the basement!

1751
01:15:58,040 --> 01:15:59,480
The basement always has a screwdriver.

1752
01:15:59,480 --> 01:15:59,780
Screw driving.

1753
01:16:00,180 --> 01:16:02,980
Cause that's where you do like screw driving things.

1754
01:16:05,500 --> 01:16:06,140
Goodbye.

1755
01:16:09,870 --> 01:16:11,150
Oh shit!

1756
01:16:14,690 --> 01:16:15,330
Died!

1757
01:16:18,710 --> 01:16:20,190
I clicked the first thing I saw!

1758
01:16:24,620 --> 01:16:26,980
It was the first thing I saw!

1759
01:16:31,280 --> 01:16:31,920
Okay.

1760
01:16:32,680 --> 01:16:33,320
Alright.

1761
01:16:34,180 --> 01:16:35,320
I think we're fine.

1762
01:16:35,780 --> 01:16:36,840
Wait, but we're...

1763
01:16:36,840 --> 01:16:38,400
I have a garage?

1764
01:16:38,780 --> 01:16:39,140
No!

1765
01:16:39,300 --> 01:16:40,560
There's no fucking garage here!

1766
01:16:41,140 --> 01:16:41,840
It's alright.

1767
01:16:42,700 --> 01:16:43,580
Everything's fine.

1768
01:16:44,120 --> 01:16:45,900
Where the fuck would...

1769
01:16:45,900 --> 01:16:48,000
Where would a screwdriver be?

1770
01:16:48,360 --> 01:16:49,500
It'd be in tools, right?

1771
01:16:51,780 --> 01:16:52,100
Yeah.

1772
01:16:52,440 --> 01:16:53,320
Or battery.

1773
01:16:53,360 --> 01:16:54,100
Could be useful.

1774
01:16:54,560 --> 01:16:56,020
I'll grab the rope too.

1775
01:16:56,980 --> 01:16:57,400
What's this?

1776
01:16:58,840 --> 01:17:00,620
Weight resistant mechanism?

1777
01:17:01,180 --> 01:17:02,660
What the fuck is that?

1778
01:17:03,800 --> 01:17:05,000
Weight resistant...

1779
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:08,700
A series of weights and levers that can resist a joystick's movement?

1780
01:17:09,080 --> 01:17:11,680
Okay, I have rope and I have battery.

1781
01:17:12,340 --> 01:17:12,940
Okay.

1782
01:17:13,860 --> 01:17:15,500
Where the fuck do I have like...

1783
01:17:16,340 --> 01:17:17,660
Okay, here we go.

1784
01:17:18,240 --> 01:17:19,340
It's not a screwdriver.

1785
01:17:19,500 --> 01:17:20,560
That's a drill.

1786
01:17:23,060 --> 01:17:23,660
No.

1787
01:17:23,660 --> 01:17:27,220
But the lights have to be...

1788
01:17:27,220 --> 01:17:29,220
The lights have to be on.

1789
01:17:31,780 --> 01:17:33,580
I feel like...

1790
01:17:33,580 --> 01:17:35,520
I don't think there's anything here.

1791
01:17:36,480 --> 01:17:38,080
Oh no, I'm worried of going outside.

1792
01:17:39,260 --> 01:17:41,700
Make a Scooby Doo trap for dad.

1793
01:17:44,220 --> 01:17:46,160
Where the fuck is my cat?

1794
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:50,000
A flashlight?

1795
01:17:51,860 --> 01:17:52,580
Cat!

1796
01:17:56,900 --> 01:17:57,340
Dad?

1797
01:17:58,360 --> 01:18:00,100
What if I just go back to my room?

1798
01:18:00,640 --> 01:18:01,220
What if I...

1799
01:18:02,220 --> 01:18:03,100
I just...

1800
01:18:03,100 --> 01:18:04,940
I feel safe in my room.

1801
01:18:06,060 --> 01:18:06,500
Okay.

1802
01:18:07,360 --> 01:18:08,680
Got a finally screwdriver.

1803
01:18:09,980 --> 01:18:10,420
Alright.

1804
01:18:10,880 --> 01:18:12,440
I don't feel safe at all.

1805
01:18:12,480 --> 01:18:13,320
Oh my god, I'm so tense.

1806
01:18:13,820 --> 01:18:15,540
I'm actually so tense right now.

1807
01:18:15,940 --> 01:18:17,240
This is so scary.

1808
01:18:17,560 --> 01:18:18,820
Then it has to be in the attic.

1809
01:18:20,940 --> 01:18:21,380
Plumbing.

1810
01:18:21,720 --> 01:18:23,060
Five, five, five, five.

1811
01:18:23,120 --> 01:18:23,920
Five, five, five, five.

1812
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:25,460
Three, two, five.

1813
01:18:26,180 --> 01:18:27,120
Five, five, five.

1814
01:18:27,260 --> 01:18:28,400
Two, two, seven, seven.

1815
01:18:28,580 --> 01:18:29,520
Do these numbers work?

1816
01:18:29,680 --> 01:18:30,360
Yeah, do they work?

1817
01:18:31,620 --> 01:18:32,020
Okay.

1818
01:18:32,980 --> 01:18:34,440
Five, five, five, five.

1819
01:18:34,700 --> 01:18:35,420
What was the plumbing?

1820
01:18:37,260 --> 01:18:38,260
What was the numbers?

1821
01:18:39,620 --> 01:18:40,560
Five, five, five.

1822
01:18:43,040 --> 01:18:44,140
Oh, contacts list.

1823
01:18:44,300 --> 01:18:44,520
Okay.

1824
01:18:45,060 --> 01:18:45,660
Oh, okay.

1825
01:18:45,720 --> 01:18:46,080
Never mind.

1826
01:18:48,280 --> 01:18:49,720
Five, five, five, five.

1827
01:18:52,060 --> 01:18:53,660
Two, two, seven.

1828
01:18:54,080 --> 01:18:54,720
Might as well.

1829
01:18:55,760 --> 01:18:56,220
Hello?

1830
01:18:57,580 --> 01:18:58,040
Oh.

1831
01:18:58,640 --> 01:18:59,920
Guys, they called on me.

1832
01:19:00,620 --> 01:19:01,740
Did I got it wrong?

1833
01:19:02,940 --> 01:19:03,900
Five, five, five.

1834
01:19:05,920 --> 01:19:08,040
Two, two, seven, seven.

1835
01:19:09,440 --> 01:19:09,900
Hello?

1836
01:19:14,140 --> 01:19:15,020
Hello, Joe's mechanic.

1837
01:19:15,140 --> 01:19:16,140
How can I help you?

1838
01:19:17,060 --> 01:19:19,420
Do you know anything about animatronics?

1839
01:19:19,820 --> 01:19:20,980
Oh my god, Oswald.

1840
01:19:21,100 --> 01:19:21,320
No.

1841
01:19:21,380 --> 01:19:22,540
Tell them to call the cops.

1842
01:19:24,120 --> 01:19:25,740
You got the wrong number, kid.

1843
01:19:26,380 --> 01:19:26,840
Okay.

1844
01:19:27,120 --> 01:19:27,580
Okay.

1845
01:19:27,580 --> 01:19:28,760
You should've called the cops!

1846
01:19:29,580 --> 01:19:30,660
I heard a door.

1847
01:19:31,440 --> 01:19:32,600
Oh, I heard a door.

1848
01:19:33,020 --> 01:19:34,260
I knew it.

1849
01:19:34,360 --> 01:19:35,400
I fucking knew it.

1850
01:19:36,900 --> 01:19:37,440
Oh.

1851
01:19:39,360 --> 01:19:40,560
Don't look through.

1852
01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:43,080
Don't look through.

1853
01:19:45,620 --> 01:19:47,640
You should've told them to call the cops!

1854
01:19:48,540 --> 01:19:49,740
Why would I be late?

1855
01:19:49,880 --> 01:19:52,680
Hey, do you know anything about fucking animatronics?

1856
01:19:54,180 --> 01:19:55,320
God damn it, child.

1857
01:19:56,720 --> 01:19:57,480
Oh, god.

1858
01:19:57,520 --> 01:19:57,560
Oh, god.

1859
01:19:58,200 --> 01:19:58,840
Where do I go?

1860
01:19:59,900 --> 01:20:00,600
Dining room?

1861
01:20:00,780 --> 01:20:02,380
I thought I could go to the attic.

1862
01:20:03,800 --> 01:20:05,100
Who the fuck is he?

1863
01:20:09,950 --> 01:20:11,350
The fuck's the screwdriver?

1864
01:20:11,550 --> 01:20:12,130
Can't I just leave?

1865
01:20:14,030 --> 01:20:15,370
Wait, I can just leave.

1866
01:20:16,850 --> 01:20:17,330
Okay.

1867
01:20:20,940 --> 01:20:21,420
Okay.

1868
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:24,240
All right, pizzeria.

1869
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:26,620
I can just leave.

1870
01:20:27,060 --> 01:20:27,540
Okay.

1871
01:20:27,540 --> 01:20:27,540
Okay.

1872
01:20:32,440 --> 01:20:35,240
I guess I'll just leave.

1873
01:20:38,040 --> 01:20:40,220
I mean, that works.

1874
01:20:41,540 --> 01:20:42,900
You're here late, kid.

1875
01:20:42,980 --> 01:20:44,140
Your parents know you're here.

1876
01:20:45,500 --> 01:20:47,820
Did I just walk all the way here?

1877
01:20:47,980 --> 01:20:49,800
My dad drove me last time.

1878
01:20:49,960 --> 01:20:51,560
Did I really walk here?

1879
01:20:52,260 --> 01:20:55,340
Yeah, dad burnt dinner, so emergency pizza.

1880
01:20:56,380 --> 01:20:57,460
What was he making?

1881
01:20:58,100 --> 01:20:59,660
You can just leave.

1882
01:21:03,620 --> 01:21:04,580
Ramen noodles.

1883
01:21:05,720 --> 01:21:07,400
As in the microwave kind?

1884
01:21:08,180 --> 01:21:08,700
Yeah.

1885
01:21:09,820 --> 01:21:11,220
Oh yeah, been there.

1886
01:21:12,520 --> 01:21:15,160
Forgot to add water once and the smell haunts you forever.

1887
01:21:16,340 --> 01:21:18,560
All right, time to go to the ball pit.

1888
01:21:20,020 --> 01:21:22,100
Yeah, where the fuck is the police station?

1889
01:21:23,300 --> 01:21:25,520
All right, off to the ball pit I'll go.

1890
01:21:27,700 --> 01:21:28,140
Here?

1891
01:21:28,400 --> 01:21:29,000
Is it this one?

1892
01:21:29,860 --> 01:21:31,340
No, it's the what, the furthest.

1893
01:21:32,900 --> 01:21:36,220
Like, I don't know, I oh my god there's the tripping mechanic there.

1894
01:21:37,980 --> 01:21:39,200
Sure do love that.

1895
01:21:39,660 --> 01:21:42,200
All right, into the ball pit I go back to 1985.

1896
01:21:45,360 --> 01:21:46,720
For the bite of 22.

1897
01:21:47,720 --> 01:21:49,460
Okay, now I gotta find dad?

1898
01:21:50,760 --> 01:21:51,200
Dad?

1899
01:21:52,740 --> 01:21:54,360
Wait, is that kid crying?

1900
01:21:55,040 --> 01:21:56,260
Maybe they need help.

1901
01:21:56,260 --> 01:21:59,340
No, is it Balloon Boy or the Puppet Guy?

1902
01:21:59,720 --> 01:22:01,940
I feel like your eyes are watching my every move.

1903
01:22:02,400 --> 01:22:03,840
Oh hey, I got wooden balls.

1904
01:22:06,040 --> 01:22:08,140
Oh, the animatronics are gone.

1905
01:22:09,420 --> 01:22:11,580
Oh, the animatronics are gone.

1906
01:22:15,130 --> 01:22:16,950
Oh, that's not good.

1907
01:22:18,670 --> 01:22:20,650
Oh, that kid's gonna die.

1908
01:22:22,410 --> 01:22:23,410
Hello, child.

1909
01:22:25,830 --> 01:22:27,370
Help me, I can't get out!

1910
01:22:28,190 --> 01:22:29,450
How did you get in there?

1911
01:22:30,570 --> 01:22:32,410
Something grabbed me and stuck me in.

1912
01:22:33,270 --> 01:22:35,110
It feels like this suit is gonna...

1913
01:22:35,110 --> 01:22:36,650
This is the Bite of 35!

1914
01:22:38,270 --> 01:22:40,370
It feels like this suit is gonna snap shut.

1915
01:22:40,830 --> 01:22:42,570
I think I can loosen the bolts with a screwdriver.

1916
01:22:42,670 --> 01:22:43,230
I'll find one.

1917
01:22:44,010 --> 01:22:44,410
Okay.

1918
01:22:46,110 --> 01:22:47,030
The door is locked.

1919
01:22:47,250 --> 01:22:49,030
Oh no, where the fuck is a screwdriver?

1920
01:22:49,810 --> 01:22:51,570
Where would a screwdriver even be?

1921
01:22:51,890 --> 01:22:52,570
Oh no.

1922
01:22:53,750 --> 01:22:54,590
I'm trying!

1923
01:22:54,970 --> 01:22:57,030
I don't know where the fuck screwdrivers are!

1924
01:22:57,590 --> 01:22:58,450
A coupon?

1925
01:22:58,630 --> 01:22:59,770
Oh, but a coupon though.

1926
01:22:59,970 --> 01:23:02,790
A coupon for Foxy's Pirates Palooza.

1927
01:23:03,670 --> 01:23:05,350
I mean, I guess... Oh, money.

1928
01:23:06,470 --> 01:23:07,770
Okay, I should...

1929
01:23:08,670 --> 01:23:11,510
No, I didn't.

1930
01:23:11,530 --> 01:23:12,630
The door is locked.

1931
01:23:13,510 --> 01:23:14,030
Wait...

1932
01:23:14,570 --> 01:23:15,490
Where would this...

1933
01:23:15,490 --> 01:23:17,390
Nope, you saw what happened last time.

1934
01:23:17,470 --> 01:23:18,450
Yeah, I won the game.

1935
01:23:20,830 --> 01:23:22,150
Did I have to go back?

1936
01:23:25,230 --> 01:23:26,670
I don't have a screwdriver!

1937
01:23:30,110 --> 01:23:31,670
Oh, the door is locked!

1938
01:23:31,850 --> 01:23:33,450
I don't know where the screwdriver is!

1939
01:23:33,970 --> 01:23:34,410
How

1940
01:23:38,470 --> 01:23:39,490
does it get the screw...

1941
01:23:40,290 --> 01:23:41,310
Dude, that's fucked.

1942
01:23:41,570 --> 01:23:42,850
That's actually fucked.

1943
01:23:43,710 --> 01:23:45,890
That's actually so...

1944
01:23:45,890 --> 01:23:47,070
Wait, no, no, no.

1945
01:23:47,170 --> 01:23:47,490
You're gay.

1946
01:23:47,770 --> 01:23:48,510
Wait, we're...

1947
01:23:48,510 --> 01:23:49,250
Back here!

1948
01:23:49,430 --> 01:23:50,190
Okay, backstage.

1949
01:23:50,450 --> 01:23:51,770
There must be a screwdriver backstage.

1950
01:23:52,450 --> 01:23:55,170
I look even creepier torn...

1951
01:23:55,710 --> 01:23:56,530
Torn apart.

1952
01:23:56,530 --> 01:23:59,290
Like, the shelf has... was some kind of hunter's...

1953
01:23:59,970 --> 01:24:00,550
trophy...

1954
01:24:01,280 --> 01:24:01,570
display.

1955
01:24:03,230 --> 01:24:04,330
A fuse box!

1956
01:24:04,750 --> 01:24:06,850
Dad's once shown me how to use one of those!

1957
01:24:08,350 --> 01:24:09,710
The wallet belongs to Dad!

1958
01:24:10,990 --> 01:24:12,470
He has to be here somewhere!

1959
01:24:16,390 --> 01:24:17,330
All right, kid.

1960
01:24:17,630 --> 01:24:19,310
I will save you one day.

1961
01:24:23,790 --> 01:24:26,830
You will get saved one day!

1962
01:24:26,830 --> 01:24:28,170
What the fuck?

1963
01:24:28,530 --> 01:24:29,410
Why am I ringing?

1964
01:24:30,530 --> 01:24:31,010
What?

1965
01:24:31,590 --> 01:24:32,790
Battery wouldn't buzz?

1966
01:24:36,250 --> 01:24:37,210
One day...

1967
01:24:38,130 --> 01:24:38,970
Do I...

1968
01:24:39,670 --> 01:24:40,150
Oh!

1969
01:24:40,350 --> 01:24:41,450
Oh, that is not good.

1970
01:24:42,170 --> 01:24:42,650
Oh!

1971
01:24:44,610 --> 01:24:46,550
I wonder if Jess has the same key.

1972
01:24:46,790 --> 01:24:47,250
Oh!

1973
01:24:47,550 --> 01:24:48,330
Hey, guys!

1974
01:24:48,410 --> 01:24:49,070
I fucked up!

1975
01:24:49,130 --> 01:24:51,110
I didn't realize that's what batteries were for!

1976
01:24:51,150 --> 01:24:52,370
I used up my one battery!

1977
01:24:52,510 --> 01:24:52,750
No!

1978
01:24:54,070 --> 01:24:54,550
No!

1979
01:24:54,550 --> 01:24:54,630
No!

1980
01:24:56,650 --> 01:24:57,850
I was curious!

1981
01:24:58,190 --> 01:24:59,350
I was like, what's that?

1982
01:25:02,630 --> 01:25:04,650
Guys, you can tell that I'm learning.

1983
01:25:05,110 --> 01:25:07,510
All right, we got to grab the screwdriver from...

1984
01:25:07,510 --> 01:25:09,050
Grab a key from Jeff.

1985
01:25:09,910 --> 01:25:11,590
Jeff, I need a screwdriver.

1986
01:25:12,010 --> 01:25:13,770
Maybe I can open these doors.

1987
01:25:14,230 --> 01:25:15,910
Maybe there's a screwdriver here.

1988
01:25:18,330 --> 01:25:19,230
Door is locked.

1989
01:25:20,130 --> 01:25:21,350
Oh, my God, please.

1990
01:25:21,910 --> 01:25:22,650
Oh, my God.

1991
01:25:23,330 --> 01:25:23,850
Oh, my God.

1992
01:25:23,850 --> 01:25:25,910
Oh, I got control panel.

1993
01:25:26,910 --> 01:25:28,270
That has to be important, right?

1994
01:25:29,970 --> 01:25:31,010
Oh, okay.

1995
01:25:31,090 --> 01:25:31,830
This is the arcade.

1996
01:25:33,950 --> 01:25:36,310
Has to be like a screwdriver here, right?

1997
01:25:36,990 --> 01:25:38,350
I got an electron gun.

1998
01:25:38,830 --> 01:25:41,010
I have everything but a fucking screwdriver!

1999
01:25:42,210 --> 01:25:42,730
Please.

2000
01:25:44,130 --> 01:25:45,750
No, it's actually at home.

2001
01:25:45,870 --> 01:25:47,830
No, I don't want to go back home!

2002
01:25:48,910 --> 01:25:50,850
Can I save my game?

2003
01:25:50,970 --> 01:25:51,430
No, okay.

2004
01:25:51,690 --> 01:25:52,350
All right.

2005
01:25:54,950 --> 01:25:55,990
I guess...

2006
01:25:55,990 --> 01:25:58,750
I guess we actually do have to go back home.

2007
01:25:59,470 --> 01:26:02,290
Okay, but let's grab all the items we can first.

2008
01:26:03,250 --> 01:26:04,510
Before we go home.

2009
01:26:06,430 --> 01:26:07,930
I can't believe it.

2010
01:26:08,150 --> 01:26:10,310
Like, is that kid actually important enough?

2011
01:26:12,310 --> 01:26:15,610
Do I actually care about the child?

2012
01:26:16,250 --> 01:26:18,750
Do you have a key to the basement, Jeff?

2013
01:26:19,990 --> 01:26:21,990
First the ball pit, now the basement?

2014
01:26:22,110 --> 01:26:23,530
Are you that bored, kid?

2015
01:26:26,430 --> 01:26:27,310
Um, yes.

2016
01:26:27,350 --> 01:26:28,630
Just feel like exploring.

2017
01:26:29,730 --> 01:26:30,830
Well, let's make a deal.

2018
01:26:30,990 --> 01:26:32,130
Just between you and me.

2019
01:26:32,230 --> 01:26:36,030
I don't pay for trash and forgot to dump a bag at the mill earlier.

2020
01:26:36,630 --> 01:26:39,810
Go take that trash over here and I'll give you the key when you get back.

2021
01:26:40,970 --> 01:26:42,210
But take that flashlight.

2022
01:26:42,390 --> 01:26:43,770
Gets pretty dark right here.

2023
01:26:43,830 --> 01:26:44,290
Around here.

2024
01:26:44,910 --> 01:26:46,950
Thanks, but the battery's pretty low.

2025
01:26:48,170 --> 01:26:50,050
Dig around the trash or you'll run out.

2026
01:26:50,310 --> 01:26:52,590
Probably all sorts of interesting things in there.

2027
01:26:53,070 --> 01:26:53,510
Oh, okay.

2028
01:26:58,870 --> 01:26:59,470
Okay.

2029
01:27:01,510 --> 01:27:02,110
Hold.

2030
01:27:02,210 --> 01:27:03,570
I just used my little...

2031
01:27:03,570 --> 01:27:08,150
Guys, wouldn't it be great if I had that other battery just then?

2032
01:27:08,390 --> 01:27:08,910
Wouldn't...

2033
01:27:08,910 --> 01:27:11,190
All right.

2034
01:27:11,990 --> 01:27:13,750
Time to go home.

2035
01:27:13,870 --> 01:27:14,710
All right.

2036
01:27:14,750 --> 01:27:15,850
Back home I go.

2037
01:27:17,350 --> 01:27:18,210
All right.

2038
01:27:18,450 --> 01:27:19,550
Night one.

2039
01:27:20,150 --> 01:27:20,750
Okay.

2040
01:27:21,990 --> 01:27:23,550
Gotta grab the screwdriver.

2041
01:27:24,690 --> 01:27:25,630
Hey, Dad, I'm home.

2042
01:27:25,650 --> 01:27:25,910
I'm back.

2043
01:27:27,290 --> 01:27:28,130
I'm not going...

2044
01:27:28,130 --> 01:27:28,210
No!

2045
01:27:28,570 --> 01:27:29,510
I can't even...

2046
01:27:31,260 --> 01:27:32,920
Are you serious?

2047
01:27:33,460 --> 01:27:34,400
I can't even...

2048
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:35,160
I didn't know.

2049
01:27:35,320 --> 01:27:38,120
I thought I could grab the screwdriver back home.

2050
01:27:45,480 --> 01:27:46,200
All right.

2051
01:27:47,160 --> 01:27:47,800
What's this?

2052
01:27:48,180 --> 01:27:48,560
Oh, hey.

2053
01:27:48,580 --> 01:27:49,080
More battery.

2054
01:27:49,480 --> 01:27:50,860
Where the fuck do I...

2055
01:27:50,860 --> 01:27:52,120
Did I get one guide?

2056
01:27:52,300 --> 01:27:53,260
Apparently, I got one guide.

2057
01:27:54,500 --> 01:27:54,940
Okay.

2058
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:55,780
I gotta do the mill.

2059
01:27:55,880 --> 01:27:56,960
Apparently, it's not even home.

2060
01:27:57,140 --> 01:27:58,420
Somebody said I got one guide.

2061
01:27:58,520 --> 01:27:59,600
God fucking damn it.

2062
01:27:59,620 --> 01:28:00,320
I always get one guide.

2063
01:28:00,600 --> 01:28:01,100
All right.

2064
01:28:01,140 --> 01:28:02,180
All right.

2065
01:28:02,180 --> 01:28:02,300
All right.

2066
01:28:07,380 --> 01:28:09,840
The mill closed down three years ago.

2067
01:28:10,040 --> 01:28:12,960
Almost everything else in this town has been closed since then.

2068
01:28:13,520 --> 01:28:13,940
All right.

2069
01:28:14,040 --> 01:28:15,560
Time to throw the trash.

2070
01:28:16,840 --> 01:28:17,860
Bag of trash.

2071
01:28:18,320 --> 01:28:19,360
I mean, that's not too bad.

2072
01:28:19,940 --> 01:28:20,600
All right.

2073
01:28:20,680 --> 01:28:21,380
I did it.

2074
01:28:25,940 --> 01:28:26,500
Pizzeria.

2075
01:28:27,660 --> 01:28:28,220
Hello.

2076
01:28:30,340 --> 01:28:32,440
How late does this place open?

2077
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:33,560
I don't know.

2078
01:28:34,260 --> 01:28:34,820
I don't know.

2079
01:28:34,840 --> 01:28:35,660
Hey, Jeff.

2080
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:37,380
Oh.

2081
01:28:38,780 --> 01:28:39,700
Jeff, I did it.

2082
01:28:40,640 --> 01:28:41,300
All done.

2083
01:28:42,460 --> 01:28:43,000
Thanks, kid.

2084
01:28:43,400 --> 01:28:44,580
Saved my ache and back.

2085
01:28:45,820 --> 01:28:47,040
Here's the key as promised.

2086
01:28:48,160 --> 01:28:48,700
All right.

2087
01:28:48,740 --> 01:28:49,060
Nice.

2088
01:28:49,200 --> 01:28:49,460
All right.

2089
01:28:50,960 --> 01:28:53,880
Time to head over to...

2090
01:28:54,860 --> 01:28:57,020
As long as Jeff is not dead, I know I'm safe.

2091
01:28:57,960 --> 01:28:59,540
Doki, you left a shotgun at home.

2092
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:03,520
You can't believe me because I paid $5 to tell you this.

2093
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:04,820
Dori, thank you.

2094
01:29:04,840 --> 01:29:05,900
Thank you for the super chat.

2095
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:06,420
Thank you.

2096
01:29:06,480 --> 01:29:07,100
Thank you.

2097
01:29:08,740 --> 01:29:10,720
I wish Jeff was my new dad.

2098
01:29:13,420 --> 01:29:14,160
All right.

2099
01:29:15,780 --> 01:29:16,980
We go this way.

2100
01:29:17,940 --> 01:29:19,660
And then we go behind here.

2101
01:29:20,720 --> 01:29:22,640
How can Jeff be my dad?

2102
01:29:23,440 --> 01:29:24,060
All right.

2103
01:29:27,620 --> 01:29:28,520
There you go.

2104
01:29:28,600 --> 01:29:30,640
I have so many stuff in my inventory now.

2105
01:29:31,740 --> 01:29:32,220
Oh.

2106
01:29:32,580 --> 01:29:33,540
I don't like that.

2107
01:29:34,440 --> 01:29:34,900
Oh.

2108
01:29:35,180 --> 01:29:36,140
I didn't...

2109
01:29:36,140 --> 01:29:36,460
Oh!

2110
01:29:39,100 --> 01:29:39,880
Why do I...

2111
01:29:39,880 --> 01:29:41,160
Why do I do that every time?

2112
01:29:41,440 --> 01:29:42,600
Just when I need the screwdriver!

2113
01:29:44,740 --> 01:29:45,380
It's fine.

2114
01:29:45,660 --> 01:29:47,040
Nothing bad is going to happen to me.

2115
01:29:50,490 --> 01:29:51,030
All right.

2116
01:29:52,270 --> 01:29:54,050
The screwdriver was here all along.

2117
01:29:54,350 --> 01:29:54,810
Wait.

2118
01:29:54,870 --> 01:29:55,450
Can I do this?

2119
01:29:55,790 --> 01:29:56,250
Okay.

2120
01:29:56,310 --> 01:29:57,150
I can't get...

2121
01:29:57,150 --> 01:29:58,810
Child, don't worry.

2122
01:30:00,110 --> 01:30:00,950
Oh, fuck.

2123
01:30:01,010 --> 01:30:01,590
I tripped.

2124
01:30:01,650 --> 01:30:02,950
Child, don't...

2125
01:30:03,770 --> 01:30:04,470
Don't worry.

2126
01:30:04,550 --> 01:30:04,890
Child, don't...

2127
01:30:04,890 --> 01:30:05,190
Child!

2128
01:30:07,410 --> 01:30:08,570
What if I just leave him?

2129
01:30:10,750 --> 01:30:11,330
Get out!

2130
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:17,360
Wait.

2131
01:30:17,440 --> 01:30:17,680
Mike?

2132
01:30:17,880 --> 01:30:18,780
No, that's not you.

2133
01:30:19,180 --> 01:30:20,300
You both wear glasses.

2134
01:30:20,380 --> 01:30:21,280
So I thought you were...

2135
01:30:21,280 --> 01:30:21,900
One second.

2136
01:30:21,920 --> 01:30:22,200
Thanks.

2137
01:30:22,360 --> 01:30:24,020
I thought I was going to be stuck in there forever.

2138
01:30:25,420 --> 01:30:25,980
One second.

2139
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:27,940
I was talking to my friend and then...

2140
01:30:31,980 --> 01:30:32,440
What's that?

2141
01:30:32,940 --> 01:30:33,960
Oh, that sounds like him.

2142
01:30:33,980 --> 01:30:34,900
He might be in danger.

2143
01:30:35,980 --> 01:30:36,540
Come on.

2144
01:30:36,560 --> 01:30:37,720
We got to find him together.

2145
01:30:38,680 --> 01:30:39,040
Nice.

2146
01:30:39,100 --> 01:30:39,700
I have bait.

2147
01:30:40,700 --> 01:30:41,060
I have bait.

2148
01:30:42,740 --> 01:30:44,320
I can run faster than him.

2149
01:30:44,640 --> 01:30:45,320
Never mind.

2150
01:30:45,380 --> 01:30:46,140
Let's get out of here.

2151
01:30:46,420 --> 01:30:47,120
Bro, see?

2152
01:30:47,240 --> 01:30:47,680
That's me.

2153
01:30:50,460 --> 01:30:51,080
That's me.

2154
01:30:51,800 --> 01:30:53,560
It's like one of us has to live.

2155
01:30:56,580 --> 01:30:57,020
Wait.

2156
01:30:57,160 --> 01:30:58,420
I'm looking for my dad.

2157
01:30:59,360 --> 01:31:02,200
You haven't seen tall man wearing a blue shirt, have you?

2158
01:31:03,560 --> 01:31:05,040
That kid's using my strategy.

2159
01:31:06,160 --> 01:31:07,360
You mean like an adult?

2160
01:31:08,020 --> 01:31:09,140
No, I haven't.

2161
01:31:10,300 --> 01:31:10,980
Look, man.

2162
01:31:10,980 --> 01:31:13,520
I wish I could help you but...

2163
01:31:13,520 --> 01:31:13,940
Wow!

2164
01:31:14,660 --> 01:31:15,940
He can't find me!

2165
01:31:16,260 --> 01:31:21,900
You find me!

2166
01:31:25,100 --> 01:31:26,800
How did he...

2167
01:31:26,800 --> 01:31:28,260
How did he find me?

2168
01:31:29,960 --> 01:31:31,180
Yes, he can.

2169
01:31:33,820 --> 01:31:34,500
Wait.

2170
01:31:34,580 --> 01:31:36,000
I got an idea.

2171
01:31:36,380 --> 01:31:37,320
I got it.

2172
01:31:37,320 --> 01:31:38,340
He can't find me twice.

2173
01:31:40,620 --> 01:31:41,980
I'm crazy!

2174
01:31:42,500 --> 01:31:43,180
Okay.

2175
01:31:43,180 --> 01:31:44,600
Okay, guys, guys, I have an idea.

2176
01:31:44,760 --> 01:31:49,600
Now that I know, now that I know what the QuickTime event was...

2177
01:31:51,720 --> 01:31:54,500
How far was I supposed to know he found me?

2178
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:55,760
Okay, skip.

2179
01:31:58,640 --> 01:32:00,420
Okay, wait, guys.

2180
01:32:01,800 --> 01:32:04,440
Guys, that QuickTime event was inhumane.

2181
01:32:05,340 --> 01:32:06,580
Okay, guys, watch this.

2182
01:32:07,080 --> 01:32:07,540
Guys.

2183
01:32:09,360 --> 01:32:10,860
Guys, I got this, guys.

2184
01:32:10,960 --> 01:32:11,740
Watch this, guys.

2185
01:32:15,180 --> 01:32:16,980
Guys, it's gonna work, guys.

2186
01:32:17,500 --> 01:32:19,920
Okay, can't find me this time.

2187
01:32:20,400 --> 01:32:22,040
Oh, that's a flashlight!

2188
01:32:26,560 --> 01:32:29,140
Okay, now I know what the key was.

2189
01:32:29,720 --> 01:32:34,240
Guys, how the fuck was I supposed to know that was a flashlight?

2190
01:32:36,740 --> 01:32:40,680
It said press F, so I assume it was a QuickTime event.

2191
01:32:41,200 --> 01:32:41,720
Okay.

2192
01:32:41,740 --> 01:32:43,440
I thought it was a QTE!

2193
01:32:44,520 --> 01:32:45,840
It says press F!

2194
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:50,840
Why didn't it turn...

2195
01:32:50,840 --> 01:32:52,160
Okay, now!

2196
01:32:52,460 --> 01:32:54,060
Now I know what to do.

2197
01:32:54,220 --> 01:32:55,000
For real.

2198
01:32:57,880 --> 01:33:00,320
Now, I figured it out.

2199
01:33:03,260 --> 01:33:05,700
The motherfucking F showed up!

2200
01:33:07,980 --> 01:33:10,660
Okay, now for realsies.

2201
01:33:11,740 --> 01:33:11,980
Okay.

2202
01:33:12,320 --> 01:33:14,060
All right, we gotta hide.

2203
01:33:15,400 --> 01:33:15,960
Okay.

2204
01:33:18,720 --> 01:33:19,680
All right, child.

2205
01:33:20,480 --> 01:33:21,540
It's your fault.

2206
01:33:23,620 --> 01:33:24,180
Okay.

2207
01:33:24,380 --> 01:33:24,940
Okay.

2208
01:33:25,500 --> 01:33:26,620
I'm trying my best.

2209
01:33:27,100 --> 01:33:28,000
There's no way.

2210
01:33:30,480 --> 01:33:31,560
There's no way!

2211
01:33:32,180 --> 01:33:32,740
No!

2212
01:33:36,230 --> 01:33:37,070
I was offscreen!

2213
01:33:37,710 --> 01:33:38,670
How did he...

2214
01:33:38,670 --> 01:33:39,970
How did he...

2215
01:33:40,950 --> 01:33:42,410
I was offscreen!

2216
01:33:43,870 --> 01:33:47,550
Everybody knows when you're offscreen, you don't see anything after that.

2217
01:33:47,790 --> 01:33:48,610
Where do I hide?

2218
01:33:49,330 --> 01:33:51,510
Like, where the fuck do I hide in this...

2219
01:33:51,510 --> 01:33:51,750
Oh.

2220
01:33:52,870 --> 01:33:53,630
Oh, okay.

2221
01:33:53,750 --> 01:33:54,470
Okay, now I know.

2222
01:33:54,910 --> 01:33:55,390
I...

2223
01:33:55,910 --> 01:33:57,470
Bro has eyes.

2224
01:33:58,930 --> 01:34:00,370
Guys, I figured it out.

2225
01:34:00,510 --> 01:34:00,870
Guys.

2226
01:34:01,030 --> 01:34:02,350
Guys, I figured it out.

2227
01:34:02,830 --> 01:34:03,970
I figured it out.

2228
01:34:07,190 --> 01:34:10,190
Yeah, but, like, he has to travel to the next screen.

2229
01:34:12,630 --> 01:34:13,790
How did he know?

2230
01:34:13,790 --> 01:34:16,770
He still had to travel to the next screen, guys.

2231
01:34:19,430 --> 01:34:20,510
That's all I'm saying.

2232
01:34:20,650 --> 01:34:21,570
How did he know?

2233
01:34:22,650 --> 01:34:23,170
Now!

2234
01:34:23,490 --> 01:34:24,490
Guys, do you think I'm gonna...

2235
01:34:24,490 --> 01:34:27,010
Guys, do you think I'm gonna beat the speedrun record?

2236
01:34:30,330 --> 01:34:32,810
Bro is actually stream sniping!

2237
01:34:32,810 --> 01:34:33,510
He is!

2238
01:34:34,250 --> 01:34:35,870
There's no way he knew!

2239
01:34:36,870 --> 01:34:38,690
Like, I was on the next screen!

2240
01:34:39,210 --> 01:34:40,570
How did he fucking know?

2241
01:34:41,190 --> 01:34:41,710
Please.

2242
01:34:41,770 --> 01:34:42,510
Please, child.

2243
01:34:42,510 --> 01:34:43,130
Child, run.

2244
01:34:43,350 --> 01:34:45,650
Run for your fucking life, child!

2245
01:34:46,810 --> 01:34:47,430
Please!

2246
01:34:47,470 --> 01:34:49,050
Why are you walking, child?

2247
01:34:51,590 --> 01:34:53,490
Open the door faster!

2248
01:34:55,210 --> 01:34:55,830
Okay.

2249
01:34:56,050 --> 01:34:56,850
There we go.

2250
01:34:57,390 --> 01:34:58,410
There's no way.

2251
01:34:59,150 --> 01:35:00,950
You can't tell this time!

2252
01:35:02,330 --> 01:35:03,850
What the fuck?!

2253
01:35:03,850 --> 01:35:06,670
Oh, shit.

2254
01:35:09,030 --> 01:35:09,650
Okay.

2255
01:35:10,330 --> 01:35:10,950
Okay.

2256
01:35:12,510 --> 01:35:13,110
There we go.

2257
01:35:16,750 --> 01:35:17,970
We did it.

2258
01:35:18,910 --> 01:35:22,090
It would be funny if I just came out of the chest right now.

2259
01:35:24,970 --> 01:35:26,710
Not the fucking spiders!

2260
01:35:27,130 --> 01:35:28,410
I have to swat the spiders!

2261
01:35:31,050 --> 01:35:33,350
Bro, I think typing up the dead.

2262
01:35:33,490 --> 01:35:36,450
I don't fucking remember where the letters are.

2263
01:35:37,310 --> 01:35:37,830
Hey.

2264
01:35:37,950 --> 01:35:38,830
We did it.

2265
01:35:40,410 --> 01:35:40,890
Okay.

2266
01:35:41,030 --> 01:35:41,870
We did it.

2267
01:35:41,970 --> 01:35:42,190
Yay!

2268
01:35:44,230 --> 01:35:44,950
All right.

2269
01:35:46,090 --> 01:35:47,650
He must be gone now, right?

2270
01:35:48,270 --> 01:35:49,330
Can I do the fuse?

2271
01:35:49,430 --> 01:35:50,070
Oh, my God.

2272
01:35:50,310 --> 01:35:50,910
It's good.

2273
01:35:51,010 --> 01:35:51,730
We get the...

2274
01:35:51,730 --> 01:35:54,550
We get the trips out of the way right now.

2275
01:35:57,510 --> 01:35:58,350
Where do I go?

2276
01:35:59,170 --> 01:35:59,650
Escape?

2277
01:36:00,090 --> 01:36:01,170
Can I just go home?

2278
01:36:02,730 --> 01:36:04,030
Like, I just...

2279
01:36:04,030 --> 01:36:04,990
Go back.

2280
01:36:05,490 --> 01:36:06,790
Go back to the ball pit.

2281
01:36:06,930 --> 01:36:07,270
Yay!

2282
01:36:08,110 --> 01:36:08,810
Oh, shit.

2283
01:36:08,810 --> 01:36:10,250
I'm home now.

2284
01:36:11,630 --> 01:36:13,770
I didn't get a lot of time to look for Dad.

2285
01:36:14,270 --> 01:36:16,530
I got tripped over five times.

2286
01:36:16,650 --> 01:36:17,810
The achievement.

2287
01:36:18,250 --> 01:36:22,430
But I gotta think of a better plan first.

2288
01:36:23,410 --> 01:36:24,590
I'm sorry, Dad.

2289
01:36:24,930 --> 01:36:26,850
Stay safe until I get back.

2290
01:36:27,590 --> 01:36:28,250
All right.

2291
01:36:28,470 --> 01:36:29,070
All right.

2292
01:36:29,530 --> 01:36:30,630
Bye, Dad.

2293
01:36:31,990 --> 01:36:33,150
I guess...

2294
01:36:33,910 --> 01:36:37,730
I guess Springtrap's my new father now.

2295
01:36:39,590 --> 01:36:40,830
What the fuck?

2296
01:36:41,730 --> 01:36:43,130
Oh, I'm having a nightmare.

2297
01:36:43,930 --> 01:36:45,570
Oh, I'm just gonna eat with him?

2298
01:36:45,750 --> 01:36:47,130
Like, does he...

2299
01:36:47,130 --> 01:36:48,090
Where's his plate?

2300
01:36:49,090 --> 01:36:50,730
Give Daddy a hug!

2301
01:36:52,970 --> 01:36:53,570
Yay!

2302
01:36:57,930 --> 01:36:58,530
No!

2303
01:37:00,790 --> 01:37:02,830
Was it all just a dream?

2304
01:37:03,650 --> 01:37:05,630
I guess I should start a day then.

2305
01:37:06,470 --> 01:37:07,530
That's so cool now.

2306
01:37:07,530 --> 01:37:08,370
Cat!

2307
01:37:09,590 --> 01:37:11,530
Is this all just a dream?

2308
01:37:13,510 --> 01:37:15,510
Cat, why did you let this happen?

2309
01:37:16,530 --> 01:37:18,230
Wait, I can unscrew this.

2310
01:37:19,510 --> 01:37:20,310
No way.

2311
01:37:20,530 --> 01:37:21,050
What?

2312
01:37:21,270 --> 01:37:22,070
Oh, my God.

2313
01:37:22,510 --> 01:37:23,030
Outside?

2314
01:37:23,370 --> 01:37:24,190
No way.

2315
01:37:24,330 --> 01:37:25,670
What do you mean, no way?

2316
01:37:26,710 --> 01:37:27,230
Like...

2317
01:37:28,430 --> 01:37:28,950
Okay.

2318
01:37:29,110 --> 01:37:30,110
No, fuck the environment.

2319
01:37:30,250 --> 01:37:31,130
Keeping the lights on.

2320
01:37:32,090 --> 01:37:32,970
Get breakfast.

2321
01:37:33,150 --> 01:37:33,410
Okay.

2322
01:37:34,650 --> 01:37:35,310
All right.

2323
01:37:36,090 --> 01:37:37,510
My rising six.

2324
01:37:37,530 --> 01:37:38,870
It has arisen.

2325
01:37:39,010 --> 01:37:39,450
Oh, no.

2326
01:37:39,510 --> 01:37:43,950
Not only do I have to deal with puberty, but I have to deal with my fucking dad.

2327
01:37:44,810 --> 01:37:46,150
My springtrap dad.

2328
01:37:48,410 --> 01:37:48,930
Huh?

2329
01:37:49,810 --> 01:37:51,230
The first day of school.

2330
01:37:51,630 --> 01:37:53,310
Are you still asleep, young man?

2331
01:37:54,010 --> 01:37:55,150
I hope not.

2332
01:37:55,370 --> 01:37:57,170
Had the strangest dream about dad.

2333
01:38:00,430 --> 01:38:03,070
No, I have to worry about girls too.

2334
01:38:06,590 --> 01:38:07,350
Don't worry.

2335
01:38:07,370 --> 01:38:07,510
Don't worry.

2336
01:38:07,510 --> 01:38:08,150
Your dad is fine.

2337
01:38:08,490 --> 01:38:10,210
He's waiting for you in the dining room.

2338
01:38:11,550 --> 01:38:12,110
What?

2339
01:38:13,770 --> 01:38:14,510
All right.

2340
01:38:16,270 --> 01:38:18,050
Let's go to the dining room.

2341
01:38:20,150 --> 01:38:21,270
Hello, dad.

2342
01:38:22,430 --> 01:38:24,930
Um, maybe I'll just skip breakfast today.

2343
01:38:25,390 --> 01:38:27,910
Well, your dad wanted to eat with you this morning.

2344
01:38:28,730 --> 01:38:30,950
Um, maybe another morning.

2345
01:38:32,330 --> 01:38:34,390
Well, don't forget your lunch.

2346
01:38:34,690 --> 01:38:36,290
So you don't starve today.

2347
01:38:36,410 --> 01:38:36,970
Oh, my God.

2348
01:38:37,670 --> 01:38:38,070
Okay.

2349
01:38:38,610 --> 01:38:39,230
Hey, dad.

2350
01:38:40,170 --> 01:38:42,770
What if I just go to dad and be like, hi.

2351
01:38:44,190 --> 01:38:45,650
That's fucking creepy, dad.

2352
01:38:47,070 --> 01:38:48,470
Wait, would I be able to...

2353
01:38:48,470 --> 01:38:49,730
Oh, I should pull up the attic.

2354
01:38:49,790 --> 01:38:52,170
I should go explore now that he's not going to kill me.

2355
01:38:52,930 --> 01:38:55,930
Mom used to rock me to sleep on this when I was a baby.

2356
01:38:56,490 --> 01:38:57,090
All right.

2357
01:38:57,190 --> 01:38:57,550
Whoa!

2358
01:38:58,510 --> 01:38:59,450
That's a lot of spiders.

2359
01:39:00,630 --> 01:39:01,030
Okay.

2360
01:39:01,110 --> 01:39:01,990
I'm just going to...

2361
01:39:01,990 --> 01:39:06,030
Now that dad's not going to kill me yet, I can, like, loot a little bit.

2362
01:39:07,930 --> 01:39:08,930
Kiss him goodbye!

2363
01:39:11,050 --> 01:39:12,790
I mean, that's cool.

2364
01:39:12,910 --> 01:39:14,830
William Afton is my father now.

2365
01:39:15,390 --> 01:39:18,090
I mean, that's pretty cool, I guess.

2366
01:39:19,890 --> 01:39:25,690
I mean, you know, not a lot of kids can tell their friends that your dad's a murderer.

2367
01:39:26,430 --> 01:39:27,510
That's pretty cool.

2368
01:39:29,550 --> 01:39:30,290
All right.

2369
01:39:30,330 --> 01:39:30,830
Let's see.

2370
01:39:31,010 --> 01:39:31,930
Dad wouldn't mind.

2371
01:39:32,310 --> 01:39:34,450
I can go into his room too.

2372
01:39:34,510 --> 01:39:35,530
Dad wouldn't mind.

2373
01:39:35,570 --> 01:39:36,010
Oh, my God.

2374
01:39:36,710 --> 01:39:38,490
Oh, there's so many batteries!

2375
01:39:40,570 --> 01:39:41,530
Let's see...

2376
01:39:41,530 --> 01:39:43,750
Looks like there's some text here from yesterday.

2377
01:39:45,330 --> 01:39:46,810
Some pictures of my family.

2378
01:39:46,910 --> 01:39:48,190
Mom and dad at Halloween.

2379
01:39:48,410 --> 01:39:49,950
Grandma holding us as a baby.

2380
01:39:50,730 --> 01:39:51,170
Alright.

2381
01:39:52,290 --> 01:39:54,070
Springtrap over cooties.

2382
01:39:54,250 --> 01:39:55,650
Look at the super chatter.

2383
01:39:55,810 --> 01:39:57,150
He's like, thank you, thank you.

2384
01:39:57,870 --> 01:39:58,770
Alright, let's see.

2385
01:39:58,830 --> 01:39:59,690
Can I grab cat food?

2386
01:40:00,850 --> 01:40:05,210
Okay, I want to make sure I grab everything before I head off.

2387
01:40:05,550 --> 01:40:06,690
Because apparently...

2388
01:40:07,590 --> 01:40:09,430
Apparently, dad's not going to kill me right now.

2389
01:40:09,690 --> 01:40:10,650
Alright, time to go to school.

2390
01:40:10,730 --> 01:40:11,130
Bye, dad.

2391
01:40:12,370 --> 01:40:13,350
Bye, Springtrap dad.

2392
01:40:15,510 --> 01:40:16,990
No, that's what I said, TD!

2393
01:40:17,410 --> 01:40:18,270
Thank you for the super chat.

2394
01:40:18,390 --> 01:40:19,110
Thank you, thank you.

2395
01:40:19,410 --> 01:40:21,330
Like, does that mean like...

2396
01:40:21,330 --> 01:40:22,570
You know...

2397
01:40:24,730 --> 01:40:26,270
You know, like...

2398
01:40:27,030 --> 01:40:28,510
Because mom doesn't know.

2399
01:40:29,690 --> 01:40:30,890
Thank you for the super chat.

2400
01:40:31,030 --> 01:40:32,170
Thank you, thank you.

2401
01:40:32,330 --> 01:40:33,530
Am I going to get like...

2402
01:40:33,530 --> 01:40:34,950
Am I going to get brother?

2403
01:40:35,330 --> 01:40:37,310
Am I going to get a brother?

2404
01:40:40,610 --> 01:40:41,770
Alright, school time.

2405
01:40:47,030 --> 01:40:47,550
Yeah!

2406
01:40:51,670 --> 01:40:52,190
Okay.

2407
01:40:55,030 --> 01:40:55,550
Hello.

2408
01:40:56,810 --> 01:40:57,610
Hello, guys.

2409
01:40:59,010 --> 01:41:01,590
I can't stop thinking about that thing.

2410
01:41:02,750 --> 01:41:04,330
I wish I could just run away.

2411
01:41:04,350 --> 01:41:04,630
I wish I could just run away.

2412
01:41:08,090 --> 01:41:10,270
Who would eat lunch at a time like this?

2413
01:41:12,830 --> 01:41:15,530
You sure that's a good idea, Jet?

2414
01:41:16,190 --> 01:41:18,750
You can leave and you're going to be such a chicken.

2415
01:41:20,590 --> 01:41:21,810
Wait, where's me?

2416
01:41:22,110 --> 01:41:22,770
Oh, I'm over there.

2417
01:41:22,930 --> 01:41:23,170
Okay.

2418
01:41:24,870 --> 01:41:28,170
Hey, who did that?

2419
01:41:29,290 --> 01:41:29,770
Run!

2420
01:41:35,500 --> 01:41:36,240
Oh, shit.

2421
01:41:36,280 --> 01:41:36,620
What's this?

2422
01:41:36,620 --> 01:41:38,300
I wonder if that kid...

2423
01:41:38,300 --> 01:41:40,820
Am I going to stuff dad Phil with fireworks?

2424
01:41:42,140 --> 01:41:43,120
Okay, everyone.

2425
01:41:43,280 --> 01:41:45,140
Let's start heading back to class.

2426
01:41:46,160 --> 01:41:47,460
Oh, are these the bad boys?

2427
01:41:47,800 --> 01:41:49,960
Hey, it smells like fresh meat.

2428
01:41:50,340 --> 01:41:52,320
Um, that would just be my lunch.

2429
01:41:53,540 --> 01:41:56,700
Oswald the Osta has forgotten how to eat?

2430
01:41:57,380 --> 01:42:00,140
That was like the one thing you could do right.

2431
01:42:00,960 --> 01:42:01,480
Hahaha.

2432
01:42:02,880 --> 01:42:04,520
Good one, Dylan.

2433
01:42:05,360 --> 01:42:07,000
Oh my god, these children.

2434
01:42:07,180 --> 01:42:08,340
Oh, what's wrong with these kids?

2435
01:42:08,500 --> 01:42:09,280
Oh, they are nerds.

2436
01:42:09,280 --> 01:42:09,520
Okay.

2437
01:42:10,660 --> 01:42:12,540
My family has three cats.

2438
01:42:13,100 --> 01:42:14,420
I love cats.

2439
01:42:15,020 --> 01:42:16,320
I have two dogs.

2440
01:42:17,120 --> 01:42:18,320
I have a rabbit.

2441
01:42:19,680 --> 01:42:21,020
I hate rabbits.

2442
01:42:21,180 --> 01:42:23,080
This is why you can't make friends, Oswald.

2443
01:42:23,340 --> 01:42:24,260
Oh my god.

2444
01:42:25,300 --> 01:42:28,380
This is exactly why nobody wants to be your friend.

2445
01:42:32,480 --> 01:42:33,940
Settle down, class.

2446
01:42:34,060 --> 01:42:36,740
Remember, the bell has to ring before you.

2447
01:42:36,740 --> 01:42:38,660
Ring, ring, ring, ring.

2448
01:42:39,740 --> 01:42:40,240
Dismissed.

2449
01:42:42,580 --> 01:42:43,940
Oswald kind of sucks.

2450
01:42:44,140 --> 01:42:45,540
Yeah, he's a little bitch.

2451
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:48,660
Yes, did you need something, Oswald?

2452
01:42:49,460 --> 01:42:49,960
Teacher?

2453
01:42:50,320 --> 01:42:52,580
My dad is an animatronic.

2454
01:42:53,780 --> 01:42:54,780
I need...

2455
01:42:54,780 --> 01:42:57,360
No, nothing, Mrs. Mee-Cham.

2456
01:42:59,020 --> 01:43:02,500
My family used to go to the roller rink after the first day of school.

2457
01:43:03,320 --> 01:43:04,960
At least you got a goal.

2458
01:43:05,180 --> 01:43:06,200
I'll never get to...

2459
01:43:06,200 --> 01:43:07,660
get to now that it's gone.

2460
01:43:08,740 --> 01:43:12,500
I'd much rather sit at home and play some Field Forge anyway.

2461
01:43:13,360 --> 01:43:17,400
I think you mean start on my Washington Urban essay, don't you?

2462
01:43:18,320 --> 01:43:20,800
Teacher, you're not supposed to eavesdrop on us.

2463
01:43:20,880 --> 01:43:21,560
That's rude.

2464
01:43:22,620 --> 01:43:25,520
I can't believe we actually did work on the first day of school.

2465
01:43:26,620 --> 01:43:27,140
Huh?

2466
01:43:27,400 --> 01:43:28,560
We did work today?

2467
01:43:29,180 --> 01:43:29,840
Oh, shit.

2468
01:43:29,880 --> 01:43:30,640
This kid's gonna fail.

2469
01:43:30,920 --> 01:43:31,980
I mean, it's sixth grade.

2470
01:43:32,040 --> 01:43:32,940
Middle school doesn't count.

2471
01:43:33,300 --> 01:43:35,120
Middle school does not count...

2472
01:43:35,120 --> 01:43:37,760
because it doesn't go on your permanent record.

2473
01:43:39,140 --> 01:43:40,040
So why try?

2474
01:43:41,400 --> 01:43:43,020
Alright, what's the school...

2475
01:43:44,420 --> 01:43:45,220
layout like?

2476
01:43:45,600 --> 01:43:47,080
Okay, is there anything I can steal?

2477
01:43:48,980 --> 01:43:50,820
Is Field Forge like Minecraft?

2478
01:43:50,940 --> 01:43:52,300
Yeah, I was like wondering what...

2479
01:43:52,300 --> 01:43:54,180
what Field Forge is.

2480
01:43:54,480 --> 01:43:55,720
Okay, can I steal anything?

2481
01:43:56,600 --> 01:43:57,740
Oh, what's this?

2482
01:43:57,920 --> 01:43:59,560
A voucher validator.

2483
01:44:00,060 --> 01:44:01,020
Love is love.

2484
01:44:01,140 --> 01:44:04,120
I have dad, a mom, and my mom's animatronic.

2485
01:44:04,120 --> 01:44:05,440
Animatronic boyfriend.

2486
01:44:08,200 --> 01:44:10,120
Thank you for the super chat, Dory.

2487
01:44:10,180 --> 01:44:11,300
Thank you, thank you.

2488
01:44:13,720 --> 01:44:14,820
Alright, let's see.

2489
01:44:16,060 --> 01:44:17,960
Looks like there's a pep rally on Friday.

2490
01:44:17,960 --> 01:44:18,980
Should be really fun.

2491
01:44:20,140 --> 01:44:22,300
Hey, you're the firecracker kid.

2492
01:44:22,920 --> 01:44:24,320
The name's Jet.

2493
01:44:24,780 --> 01:44:26,900
That has a nice ring to it too.

2494
01:44:27,720 --> 01:44:29,500
Do you have any more I could borrow?

2495
01:44:30,980 --> 01:44:32,060
First off, kid.

2496
01:44:32,060 --> 01:44:35,080
You can't just borrow a firecracker.

2497
01:44:35,280 --> 01:44:37,780
You're kind of a one-time use only.

2498
01:44:39,020 --> 01:44:39,840
Okay, then.

2499
01:44:40,160 --> 01:44:41,680
Can you give me one?

2500
01:44:42,440 --> 01:44:45,520
Do you have any idea what these things cost?

2501
01:44:46,220 --> 01:44:47,720
Yeah, aren't they illegal in America?

2502
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:49,880
Tell you what.

2503
01:44:50,440 --> 01:44:52,440
I'm usually at the library after school.

2504
01:44:52,540 --> 01:44:55,060
What the fuck kind of tough kid are you?

2505
01:44:55,100 --> 01:44:56,380
Why are you at the library?

2506
01:44:57,240 --> 01:44:59,500
Bring me something I couldn't get anywhere else.

2507
01:44:59,500 --> 01:45:01,820
And maybe we can trade.

2508
01:45:02,580 --> 01:45:03,380
What the fuck?

2509
01:45:03,420 --> 01:45:04,200
Are you a nerd?

2510
01:45:05,180 --> 01:45:06,980
What the fuck are you doing at the library?

2511
01:45:09,800 --> 01:45:12,320
Time to pull out the fire alarm.

2512
01:45:13,220 --> 01:45:15,120
Oh my god, there's the nerds.

2513
01:45:15,160 --> 01:45:17,840
Please cheer us on in the regional volleyball tournament.

2514
01:45:18,140 --> 01:45:20,280
I know we can win it all this year.

2515
01:45:20,600 --> 01:45:22,480
Okay, I don't really care about these children.

2516
01:45:23,240 --> 01:45:25,620
You won't believe what happened in science class today.

2517
01:45:25,940 --> 01:45:29,360
We tried to make a volcano model and it exploded all over the teacher.

2518
01:45:29,960 --> 01:45:31,500
It really made the classroom...

2519
01:45:31,500 --> 01:45:32,700
Okay, I don't care about you either.

2520
01:45:33,180 --> 01:45:33,780
All right.

2521
01:45:37,090 --> 01:45:39,770
All right, let's see if I can steal anything from the principal.

2522
01:45:40,510 --> 01:45:42,770
A framed article from the school newspaper.

2523
01:45:43,170 --> 01:45:45,690
The headlines about the time we won a kickball tournament.

2524
01:45:46,330 --> 01:45:47,510
The teacher has nothing?

2525
01:45:48,650 --> 01:45:49,590
What the fuck?

2526
01:45:49,650 --> 01:45:51,210
This is the principal's office.

2527
01:45:52,070 --> 01:45:54,430
How can it not have anything useful?

2528
01:45:55,990 --> 01:45:57,430
Oh, no, the spider.

2529
01:45:58,470 --> 01:45:59,890
Okay, there must be...

2530
01:45:59,890 --> 01:46:00,470
Oh, just...

2531
01:46:00,470 --> 01:46:01,050
Never mind.

2532
01:46:01,110 --> 01:46:01,890
It's just garbage.

2533
01:46:02,990 --> 01:46:04,570
Okay, not even batteries?

2534
01:46:05,510 --> 01:46:06,530
I know, right?

2535
01:46:06,850 --> 01:46:08,310
The fuck is the...

2536
01:46:10,090 --> 01:46:11,650
Oh, wait, can I steal his basketball?

2537
01:46:11,970 --> 01:46:13,030
Oh, I can't.

2538
01:46:13,470 --> 01:46:16,110
I can't steal anything here.

2539
01:46:18,670 --> 01:46:19,710
What does the...

2540
01:46:19,710 --> 01:46:20,890
What does this guy want?

2541
01:46:21,530 --> 01:46:22,450
I don't know.

2542
01:46:22,890 --> 01:46:25,730
Do I have stuff right now for the...

2543
01:46:25,730 --> 01:46:26,570
For the punk?

2544
01:46:28,230 --> 01:46:29,730
How about you read a book?

2545
01:46:29,890 --> 01:46:31,150
On how not to be a loser?

2546
01:46:31,290 --> 01:46:31,430
Oh!

2547
01:46:33,870 --> 01:46:34,350
Ha!

2548
01:46:35,230 --> 01:46:36,110
Come on, guys.

2549
01:46:36,710 --> 01:46:39,350
Let's stop wasting time on this nerds.

2550
01:46:39,510 --> 01:46:41,690
Bro, they're fucking headed to the library.

2551
01:46:46,070 --> 01:46:47,230
Don't listen to them.

2552
01:46:47,470 --> 01:46:49,370
Dylan's just jealous because you know how...

2553
01:46:50,650 --> 01:46:52,390
Bro, we're in sixth grade.

2554
01:46:52,510 --> 01:46:54,470
What do you mean by that?

2555
01:46:57,510 --> 01:46:58,490
We're in sixth...

2556
01:46:58,490 --> 01:46:59,130
Oh, my...

2557
01:46:59,130 --> 01:47:02,490
Dylan should not be in sixth grade if he still doesn't know how to read.

2558
01:47:10,410 --> 01:47:11,370
Thank you.

2559
01:47:11,770 --> 01:47:14,690
The bullies picked on me for reading at my old school.

2560
01:47:14,990 --> 01:47:15,610
What's wrong?

2561
01:47:16,250 --> 01:47:17,270
We're in sixth grade.

2562
01:47:17,310 --> 01:47:18,690
We're supposed to know how to read.

2563
01:47:20,050 --> 01:47:22,510
Well, that must be pretty stupid.

2564
01:47:25,510 --> 01:47:27,670
I read a ton of sci-fi.

2565
01:47:28,050 --> 01:47:29,170
What are you reading?

2566
01:47:31,010 --> 01:47:31,490
Ancient...

2567
01:47:31,490 --> 01:47:31,990
Oh, no.

2568
01:47:32,050 --> 01:47:32,730
This is a nerd.

2569
01:47:32,850 --> 01:47:33,230
Nerd!

2570
01:47:34,230 --> 01:47:34,710
Ancient...

2571
01:47:34,710 --> 01:47:37,470
Who the fuck reads ancient Greek mythology at sixth grade?

2572
01:47:37,570 --> 01:47:38,090
I did.

2573
01:47:40,290 --> 01:47:42,590
Oh, I've been meaning to get around to that one.

2574
01:47:44,670 --> 01:47:47,650
It's not much different from science fiction, really.

2575
01:47:49,330 --> 01:47:51,550
It's all about being brave during impossible situations.

2576
01:47:54,150 --> 01:47:59,910
Well, if you ever want to read something with pictures in it, I'd be happy to lend you a comic.

2577
01:48:00,830 --> 01:48:05,150
Oh, if you like art, you'll actually have a use for this thing.

2578
01:48:06,010 --> 01:48:11,790
I was helping my grandpa clear out some junk yesterday and found his old sketchbook.

2579
01:48:12,430 --> 01:48:13,690
There's some neat drawings.

2580
01:48:14,470 --> 01:48:15,210
Oh, shit.

2581
01:48:15,230 --> 01:48:15,470
Nice.

2582
01:48:16,110 --> 01:48:17,110
I love free stuff.

2583
01:48:17,870 --> 01:48:18,650
Is it this?

2584
01:48:19,270 --> 01:48:20,210
What the fuck?

2585
01:48:20,950 --> 01:48:21,530
What the fuck?

2586
01:48:21,530 --> 01:48:22,730
No...

2587
01:48:22,730 --> 01:48:23,910
Bro!

2588
01:48:24,250 --> 01:48:24,910
What?

2589
01:48:30,010 --> 01:48:31,790
You didn't think this was weird?

2590
01:48:34,850 --> 01:48:35,510
What?

2591
01:48:37,490 --> 01:48:38,390
New behavior.

2592
01:48:38,630 --> 01:48:43,170
Chica is making garbage nests make employees aware all garbage needs taken out before closing.

2593
01:48:43,590 --> 01:48:44,050
Wait.

2594
01:48:44,210 --> 01:48:44,830
His...

2595
01:48:44,830 --> 01:48:46,550
Her grandpa used to work...

2596
01:48:46,550 --> 01:48:46,770
Wait.

2597
01:48:46,830 --> 01:48:48,670
Is her grandpa the security guard?

2598
01:48:52,790 --> 01:48:54,050
Any voice...

2599
01:48:54,050 --> 01:48:55,550
Is that the purple?

2600
01:48:56,310 --> 01:48:57,510
Everybody is the purple.

2601
01:48:57,510 --> 01:48:58,310
He's the purple guy.

2602
01:48:59,850 --> 01:49:01,910
Why does he keep screaming?

2603
01:49:02,290 --> 01:49:06,130
Keep bright flashes away from Freddy's suit sends him into a frenzy.

2604
01:49:06,250 --> 01:49:08,490
Remember, the dark eyes are always watching.

2605
01:49:09,190 --> 01:49:13,250
AI programming causes Freddy to stalk partygoers by guarding doors.

2606
01:49:13,650 --> 01:49:15,370
Tech tool is in.

2607
01:49:15,830 --> 01:49:18,170
Everybody is a purple guy.

2608
01:49:18,730 --> 01:49:19,410
Okay.

2609
01:49:19,730 --> 01:49:20,870
Oh, there's the birthday.

2610
01:49:21,050 --> 01:49:21,650
It bites.

2611
01:49:21,710 --> 01:49:22,610
Keep fingers away.

2612
01:49:22,850 --> 01:49:24,990
Recent security update fried the AI.

2613
01:49:25,430 --> 01:49:27,230
Chica stuck in preservation.

2614
01:49:27,230 --> 01:49:27,690
Protocol.

2615
01:49:28,550 --> 01:49:28,990
Okay.

2616
01:49:30,650 --> 01:49:31,230
What's this?

2617
01:49:32,430 --> 01:49:35,210
Chica will bring so and full to the pile and eat it.

2618
01:49:35,270 --> 01:49:35,430
Oh.

2619
01:49:35,690 --> 01:49:36,330
All right.

2620
01:49:36,370 --> 01:49:37,130
So it's like nesting.

2621
01:49:38,270 --> 01:49:38,710
Crested.

2622
01:49:38,710 --> 01:49:39,310
Oh, it was changed.

2623
01:49:39,390 --> 01:49:40,390
We dumped offsite.

2624
01:49:40,510 --> 01:49:42,510
Oh, here's like Bonnie's guitars.

2625
01:49:45,230 --> 01:49:45,930
Full suit.

2626
01:49:47,350 --> 01:49:47,790
Padding.

2627
01:49:48,770 --> 01:49:49,210
Exoskeleton.

2628
01:49:49,610 --> 01:49:50,650
Oh, it is stickers.

2629
01:49:52,010 --> 01:49:52,670
All right.

2630
01:49:55,350 --> 01:49:56,230
That's interesting.

2631
01:49:56,330 --> 01:49:56,770
Okay.

2632
01:49:58,610 --> 01:49:59,490
No way.

2633
01:50:00,570 --> 01:50:02,250
He used to be some kind of technician.

2634
01:50:02,270 --> 01:50:04,890
So they're just doodles and notes from his old job.

2635
01:50:05,330 --> 01:50:07,250
He didn't want to talk about it, though.

2636
01:50:08,030 --> 01:50:11,510
I was supposed to throw it away, but didn't want to waste paper, you know?

2637
01:50:14,570 --> 01:50:15,010
Haha.

2638
01:50:15,570 --> 01:50:16,010
Yeah.

2639
01:50:17,410 --> 01:50:18,950
I'm Gabriella, by the way.

2640
01:50:20,090 --> 01:50:20,970
I'm Oswald.

2641
01:50:21,170 --> 01:50:23,910
This is an interesting sketchbook, Gabriella.

2642
01:50:24,410 --> 01:50:24,850
Thanks.

2643
01:50:26,070 --> 01:50:26,670
All right.

2644
01:50:27,770 --> 01:50:28,430
What's this?

2645
01:50:29,750 --> 01:50:31,110
I can't go back in.

2646
01:50:33,690 --> 01:50:34,190
Okay.

2647
01:50:34,250 --> 01:50:35,010
I don't care.

2648
01:50:38,810 --> 01:50:39,310
Apparently...

2649
01:50:40,390 --> 01:50:42,850
Have you checked out that new game, WrestleQuest?

2650
01:50:43,210 --> 01:50:45,830
My dad was telling me all about the different wrestlers.

2651
01:50:46,350 --> 01:50:49,270
I don't know how much about wrestling going in, but I do now.

2652
01:50:49,970 --> 01:50:50,470
Okay.

2653
01:50:51,010 --> 01:50:51,870
Where's the...

2654
01:50:53,370 --> 01:50:55,210
Where's the fucking Vtuber fan?

2655
01:50:59,030 --> 01:51:01,230
We were saying the Vtuber fan was here.

2656
01:51:02,730 --> 01:51:03,970
Where's the Vtuber kid?

2657
01:51:04,150 --> 01:51:05,330
I want to know what he looks like.

2658
01:51:06,230 --> 01:51:07,010
Is that you?

2659
01:51:07,190 --> 01:51:08,250
No, that's the gamer student.

2660
01:51:08,510 --> 01:51:09,310
Where the fuck is...

2661
01:51:09,310 --> 01:51:09,690
Is it the...

2662
01:51:10,150 --> 01:51:11,110
That's the observant student.

2663
01:51:11,430 --> 01:51:13,050
Where the fuck is the Vtuber fan?

2664
01:51:14,130 --> 01:51:15,530
Someone said he's like here.

2665
01:51:17,650 --> 01:51:18,950
It can't be these guys.

2666
01:51:19,070 --> 01:51:20,370
These guys are talking about pets.

2667
01:51:21,050 --> 01:51:22,590
Where are the Vtuber kids?

2668
01:51:23,730 --> 01:51:24,250
Okay.

2669
01:51:25,910 --> 01:51:28,310
That's still the guy that's like cheering me on.

2670
01:51:28,730 --> 01:51:29,970
Bro, talk to everybody.

2671
01:51:31,890 --> 01:51:33,170
Talk to all of them.

2672
01:51:34,590 --> 01:51:36,830
Because this is like the second...

2673
01:51:36,830 --> 01:51:37,750
This is the classroom.

2674
01:51:39,210 --> 01:51:40,010
Did he...

2675
01:51:40,690 --> 01:51:41,610
Did he got...

2676
01:51:41,610 --> 01:51:42,350
Did he got beat up?

2677
01:51:43,210 --> 01:51:43,890
Did he...

2678
01:51:46,930 --> 01:51:47,970
Somebody threw...

2679
01:51:47,970 --> 01:51:48,210
Wait.

2680
01:51:48,310 --> 01:51:48,790
What?

2681
01:51:48,890 --> 01:51:49,890
You can go inside?

2682
01:51:50,290 --> 01:51:51,230
Oh my God.

2683
01:51:52,050 --> 01:51:52,570
Oh my God.

2684
01:51:52,570 --> 01:51:53,850
You can open doors?

2685
01:51:54,650 --> 01:51:55,910
Who are you?

2686
01:52:00,310 --> 01:52:01,430
Oh my God.

2687
01:52:01,550 --> 01:52:02,490
This is crazy.

2688
01:52:03,630 --> 01:52:04,230
AI...

2689
01:52:04,230 --> 01:52:05,770
AI is so crazy.

2690
01:52:05,870 --> 01:52:07,190
They can open doors now.

2691
01:52:08,930 --> 01:52:09,530
They...

2692
01:52:10,630 --> 01:52:11,730
They actually...

2693
01:52:11,730 --> 01:52:11,970
Okay.

2694
01:52:12,030 --> 01:52:12,730
I'm fucking leaving.

2695
01:52:13,110 --> 01:52:13,610
We can't...

2696
01:52:13,610 --> 01:52:15,090
The Vtuber child isn't here.

2697
01:52:15,430 --> 01:52:16,090
All right.

2698
01:52:16,130 --> 01:52:17,190
We time to go home.

2699
01:52:17,390 --> 01:52:18,030
Oh, sorry.

2700
01:52:18,170 --> 01:52:18,810
Wrong place.

2701
01:52:19,310 --> 01:52:20,490
Went to the mirror.

2702
01:52:21,250 --> 01:52:22,190
Day two.

2703
01:52:22,370 --> 01:52:22,970
Okay.

2704
01:52:23,510 --> 01:52:24,110
Okay.

2705
01:52:24,130 --> 01:52:25,010
All right.

2706
01:52:25,050 --> 01:52:25,670
Not here.

2707
01:52:28,050 --> 01:52:28,610
Oh.

2708
01:52:28,850 --> 01:52:29,910
What the fuck?

2709
01:52:30,070 --> 01:52:30,990
Did you guys hear that?

2710
01:52:32,590 --> 01:52:33,310
All right.

2711
01:52:33,350 --> 01:52:34,070
Time to go.

2712
01:52:35,590 --> 01:52:36,150
Oh.

2713
01:52:36,210 --> 01:52:36,770
To the lock...

2714
01:52:36,770 --> 01:52:37,770
The locker?

2715
01:52:37,910 --> 01:52:38,150
Wait.

2716
01:52:38,290 --> 01:52:38,670
What?

2717
01:52:38,990 --> 01:52:40,030
In the locker?

2718
01:52:40,030 --> 01:52:41,910
I'm not getting one guy.

2719
01:52:42,210 --> 01:52:45,110
I'm not getting one guy.

2720
01:52:47,910 --> 01:52:48,990
I am...

2721
01:52:48,990 --> 01:52:52,110
I know for a fact that he's not in the locker.

2722
01:52:52,110 --> 01:52:54,050
You can't fucking trick me.

2723
01:52:54,070 --> 01:52:54,110
Okay.

2724
01:52:54,130 --> 01:52:55,390
He wants to...

2725
01:52:56,490 --> 01:52:57,370
He wants to get in there.

2726
01:52:57,370 --> 01:52:57,510
It's a locker.

2727
01:52:58,070 --> 01:52:59,770
He went to see his Oshii.

2728
01:52:59,830 --> 01:53:01,590
His Oshii streams at 5 p.m.

2729
01:53:01,590 --> 01:53:02,070
PST.

2730
01:53:02,250 --> 01:53:03,830
He had to get there in time.

2731
01:53:09,540 --> 01:53:10,180
All right.

2732
01:53:12,100 --> 01:53:12,960
Let's see.

2733
01:53:13,900 --> 01:53:14,540
All right.

2734
01:53:14,560 --> 01:53:15,100
Go home.

2735
01:53:15,400 --> 01:53:16,260
Hello, dad.

2736
01:53:18,240 --> 01:53:18,960
I'm home.

2737
01:53:19,200 --> 01:53:20,640
Don't you have to go to work?

2738
01:53:22,740 --> 01:53:24,540
Like, doesn't he have to go to...

2739
01:53:24,540 --> 01:53:26,180
Go to his, like, 9 to 5?

2740
01:53:26,240 --> 01:53:26,440
I don't know.

2741
01:53:30,160 --> 01:53:33,320
I believe he came back from his 9 to 5.

2742
01:53:33,700 --> 01:53:36,040
He's like, yes I did it.

2743
01:53:36,080 --> 01:53:39,080
I successfully possessed another soul.

2744
01:53:39,480 --> 01:53:40,500
Oh my god.

2745
01:53:40,620 --> 01:53:42,460
And then he still has to go to work.

2746
01:53:45,700 --> 01:53:48,940
Oh yeah, he has to work part time at the corner store.

2747
01:53:49,500 --> 01:53:51,820
Bro, he's like a 7-Eleven.

2748
01:53:51,960 --> 01:53:54,040
He works at a 7-Eleven.

2749
01:53:56,640 --> 01:54:00,580
Oh my god, even Springtrap needs to get a job.

2750
01:54:02,100 --> 01:54:03,480
Time to go back to Jeff.

2751
01:54:03,600 --> 01:54:04,700
I think I have a plan now.

2752
01:54:08,320 --> 01:54:09,880
Gotta get out here first.

2753
01:54:10,380 --> 01:54:11,980
He needs that money.

2754
01:54:12,700 --> 01:54:17,360
He needs to make sure the wife doesn't know something's up.

2755
01:54:23,890 --> 01:54:26,210
Oh, I can just leave like that.

2756
01:54:26,310 --> 01:54:27,230
That's convenient now.

2757
01:54:29,050 --> 01:54:29,570
Alright.

2758
01:54:31,250 --> 01:54:32,970
He's gotta press the boot.

2759
01:54:33,390 --> 01:54:34,710
The new boot.

2760
01:54:38,250 --> 01:54:39,710
Thank you for the super chat.

2761
01:54:39,790 --> 01:54:40,050
Thank you.

2762
01:54:40,390 --> 01:54:46,910
Imagine finally getting a body possessed and return from the afterlife only to realize you need to pay taxes again.

2763
01:54:47,090 --> 01:54:48,490
And you have to work part time.

2764
01:54:48,790 --> 01:54:49,910
Dude, that's the worst part.

2765
01:54:50,990 --> 01:54:54,570
You have to do minimum wage.

2766
01:54:54,690 --> 01:54:55,870
I feel bad for him.

2767
01:54:55,870 --> 01:55:00,430
You literally came back to fucking work at the bite of 7-Eleven.

2768
01:55:00,750 --> 01:55:02,750
Is that the bite of 7-Eleven?

2769
01:55:03,250 --> 01:55:04,670
Darkblade, thank you for the super chat.

2770
01:55:04,750 --> 01:55:05,090
Thank you.

2771
01:55:05,130 --> 01:55:05,590
Thank you.

2772
01:55:08,870 --> 01:55:09,350
Okay.

2773
01:55:09,990 --> 01:55:11,810
Wait, there's another lady here?

2774
01:55:12,990 --> 01:55:15,590
I sing forever to get my pizza.

2775
01:55:15,710 --> 01:55:16,190
I swear.

2776
01:55:16,250 --> 01:55:18,870
The longer I wait, the more I can hear the rats in the wall.

2777
01:55:19,070 --> 01:55:20,810
Like, what if the kitchen has rats?

2778
01:55:21,050 --> 01:55:23,710
Even worse, what if the cooks are rats?

2779
01:55:25,090 --> 01:55:26,590
Don't tell me to calm down.

2780
01:55:26,650 --> 01:55:27,850
You know I have mouse-a-phobia.

2781
01:55:28,710 --> 01:55:30,330
Seems distracted and paranoid.

2782
01:55:31,930 --> 01:55:36,910
But they told me in Ratatouille that if there's rats in the kitchen, that means...

2783
01:55:36,910 --> 01:55:41,090
That means the kitchen is like super hygienic, right?

2784
01:55:43,710 --> 01:55:45,610
I've seen Jeff use this before.

2785
01:55:45,690 --> 01:55:47,010
Oh, does that mean I can go in here?

2786
01:55:47,630 --> 01:55:48,070
No?

2787
01:55:48,430 --> 01:55:49,790
Oh wait, that should work.

2788
01:55:50,670 --> 01:55:52,130
I have the key for this.

2789
01:55:53,710 --> 01:55:54,750
Yeah, in Ratatouille.

2790
01:55:56,350 --> 01:55:57,270
In Ratatouille.

2791
01:55:57,750 --> 01:56:00,130
Like, they make really good...

2792
01:56:00,560 --> 01:56:01,990
They make really good food.

2793
01:56:03,110 --> 01:56:04,550
Ratatouille wouldn't lie to me.

2794
01:56:05,410 --> 01:56:07,110
Okay, I want to make sure that...

2795
01:56:08,510 --> 01:56:10,010
That I have everything here.

2796
01:56:10,130 --> 01:56:12,250
I feel like I don't really need to use the flashlights.

2797
01:56:12,630 --> 01:56:14,550
I can sort of see what's going on.

2798
01:56:18,290 --> 01:56:18,750
Alright.

2799
01:56:19,910 --> 01:56:21,690
Back to the ball pit at goal.

2800
01:56:23,090 --> 01:56:23,890
Alright, time.

2801
01:56:23,890 --> 01:56:26,250
Ball pit time-traveling machine.

2802
01:56:28,530 --> 01:56:29,810
Ball pit time machine.

2803
01:56:30,210 --> 01:56:32,630
It's like the hot tub time machine, but with more balls.

2804
01:56:33,750 --> 01:56:35,650
I heard before.

2805
01:56:36,130 --> 01:56:37,490
Wonder where it came from.

2806
01:56:38,230 --> 01:56:39,570
Thank you for the super chat.

2807
01:56:39,670 --> 01:56:40,310
Thank you, thank you.

2808
01:56:40,410 --> 01:56:42,990
Imagine if Oswald convinces everyone Dad is a robot.

2809
01:56:43,230 --> 01:56:47,730
But instead of people freaking out, Springtrap just gets confiscated by scientists for study.

2810
01:56:47,870 --> 01:56:48,750
That's a happy ending.

2811
01:56:49,270 --> 01:56:50,730
But like, oh...

2812
01:56:51,290 --> 01:56:51,810
Okay.

2813
01:56:51,810 --> 01:56:54,310
Well, it's obviously back here.

2814
01:56:57,010 --> 01:56:57,850
What's this?

2815
01:56:59,510 --> 01:57:00,190
Yay!

2816
01:57:01,830 --> 01:57:02,910
I did it!

2817
01:57:04,570 --> 01:57:06,130
Alright, find Dad.

2818
01:57:06,930 --> 01:57:08,390
Where could Dad be?

2819
01:57:09,930 --> 01:57:11,110
Better be careful.

2820
01:57:13,650 --> 01:57:15,130
Where's the crying from?

2821
01:57:17,650 --> 01:57:19,010
Oh, I don't like this.

2822
01:57:20,570 --> 01:57:21,010
Wow!

2823
01:57:22,130 --> 01:57:22,570
No!

2824
01:57:22,830 --> 01:57:25,750
What do you mean he's still walking while I was trying to fucking get...

2825
01:57:25,750 --> 01:57:26,250
Oh, okay.

2826
01:57:26,610 --> 01:57:30,790
I'm literally in a dialogue scene and he's still walking towards me?

2827
01:57:31,090 --> 01:57:31,810
That's fucked.

2828
01:57:32,190 --> 01:57:35,390
I swear to God if I trip, I swear to fucking God if I trip.

2829
01:57:38,990 --> 01:57:39,430
Okay.

2830
01:57:39,870 --> 01:57:40,530
Oh, no.

2831
01:57:40,590 --> 01:57:41,370
It's spider time.

2832
01:57:41,890 --> 01:57:43,110
It's spider time.

2833
01:57:43,430 --> 01:57:44,110
Oh, God.

2834
01:57:45,430 --> 01:57:46,810
I'm swatting the spiders.

2835
01:57:48,710 --> 01:57:49,190
Okay.

2836
01:57:49,950 --> 01:57:51,750
I know where my letters are.

2837
01:57:52,710 --> 01:57:54,010
How's he still walking around?

2838
01:57:56,490 --> 01:57:58,470
I can't believe I talked to him a long time.

2839
01:57:58,890 --> 01:57:59,730
What is this?

2840
01:58:05,410 --> 01:58:06,490
Alright here we go.

2841
01:58:06,550 --> 01:58:08,030
The spider quick time events.

2842
01:58:08,770 --> 01:58:09,250
Alright.

2843
01:58:09,490 --> 01:58:10,130
Oh, hey.

2844
01:58:10,150 --> 01:58:10,530
There's money.

2845
01:58:11,210 --> 01:58:12,070
I like money.

2846
01:58:13,010 --> 01:58:13,490
Alright.

2847
01:58:14,510 --> 01:58:15,830
He has to be gone now, right?

2848
01:58:24,760 --> 01:58:27,320
I can't just walk out right now.

2849
01:58:31,800 --> 01:58:32,940
That's fucked!

2850
01:58:36,580 --> 01:58:37,980
That's not fair!

2851
01:58:40,760 --> 01:58:40,940
That's not fair!

2852
01:58:40,940 --> 01:58:41,020
That's not fair!

2853
01:58:43,160 --> 01:58:43,800
That's not fair!

2854
01:58:43,820 --> 01:58:44,860
Oh no!

2855
01:58:47,080 --> 01:58:48,320
Is he still there?

2856
01:58:48,700 --> 01:58:49,740
I'm just gonna walk.

2857
01:58:52,820 --> 01:58:53,900
Oh, I hear him.

2858
01:58:54,140 --> 01:58:55,760
He used the door, but which door?

2859
01:58:58,300 --> 01:59:00,200
It has to be the first door.

2860
01:59:00,700 --> 01:59:02,740
Okay, I actually have to walk now.

2861
01:59:08,950 --> 01:59:09,470
Okay.

2862
01:59:16,710 --> 01:59:18,030
Where's the other kid?

2863
01:59:22,380 --> 01:59:23,580
The door is locked?

2864
01:59:24,020 --> 01:59:25,380
Then where the fuck do I go?

2865
01:59:26,520 --> 01:59:27,040
Yes!

2866
01:59:28,260 --> 01:59:28,640
Seriously!

2867
01:59:29,820 --> 01:59:30,960
Like, where do I go?

2868
01:59:33,780 --> 01:59:34,260
Like...

2869
01:59:34,900 --> 01:59:36,920
He's over in that door though!

2870
01:59:42,350 --> 01:59:43,350
Oh, I hear him.

2871
01:59:44,290 --> 01:59:45,250
I hear him.

2872
01:59:46,070 --> 01:59:47,770
I forgot what this minigame was.

2873
01:59:55,440 --> 01:59:57,420
He didn't see me, so he can't know.

2874
01:59:58,560 --> 01:59:59,740
There's no way he knows.

2875
01:59:59,800 --> 02:00:00,560
He didn't see me.

2876
02:00:06,260 --> 02:00:06,740
Okay.

2877
02:00:07,740 --> 02:00:08,280
I'm good.

2878
02:00:08,480 --> 02:00:09,340
I'm gonna walk.

2879
02:00:10,160 --> 02:00:10,920
I'm gonna walk.

2880
02:00:11,920 --> 02:00:13,400
I was like, JK.

2881
02:00:13,480 --> 02:00:15,040
And then I saw the meter.

2882
02:00:15,180 --> 02:00:15,860
I was like, never mind.

2883
02:00:15,960 --> 02:00:16,900
I shall walk now.

2884
02:00:19,020 --> 02:00:21,160
Where's the crying coming from?

2885
02:00:22,260 --> 02:00:23,060
Is she here?

2886
02:00:40,960 --> 02:00:42,440
Oh, he just wants food.

2887
02:00:42,500 --> 02:00:42,720
Okay.

2888
02:00:44,440 --> 02:00:45,580
He's just hungry.

2889
02:00:46,240 --> 02:00:47,320
Okay, bye chica!

2890
02:00:49,040 --> 02:00:49,960
He's just...

2891
02:00:50,560 --> 02:00:50,960
Okay.

2892
02:00:51,440 --> 02:00:53,080
Does that thing even have a stomach?

2893
02:00:53,160 --> 02:00:55,580
How did it smell my lunch from that far away?

2894
02:00:56,340 --> 02:00:56,740
Alright.

2895
02:00:57,080 --> 02:00:58,920
That's definitely a kid in the kitchen.

2896
02:00:59,380 --> 02:01:02,920
But I can't get them to lure that thing back to it's weird nest.

2897
02:01:03,260 --> 02:01:04,060
Oh, I need to find food!

2898
02:01:05,020 --> 02:01:09,700
If it was my one's food, maybe I could get a pizza slice, a pizza from Jeff.

2899
02:01:09,920 --> 02:01:10,080
If it was my one's food, maybe I could get a pizza slice, a pizza from Jeff.

2900
02:01:10,080 --> 02:01:11,440
Okay, so I have to go back.

2901
02:01:13,140 --> 02:01:14,780
Oh, and I hate the rat noises.

2902
02:01:14,960 --> 02:01:15,100
Oh, and I hate the rat noises.

2903
02:01:16,220 --> 02:01:16,880
No!

2904
02:01:18,100 --> 02:01:19,060
That's nothing!

2905
02:01:36,570 --> 02:01:38,170
That's so funny!

2906
02:01:38,510 --> 02:01:38,730
Am

2907
02:01:42,780 --> 02:01:44,220
I stuck?

2908
02:01:54,280 --> 02:01:55,620
There's no way he knows.

2909
02:01:55,760 --> 02:01:57,520
There's no way he knows, right?

2910
02:01:57,660 --> 02:01:58,380
There's no way.

2911
02:01:59,110 --> 02:02:00,360
Are you serious?

2912
02:02:05,580 --> 02:02:06,760
That's so...

2913
02:02:07,110 --> 02:02:08,060
That's so funny!

2914
02:02:08,740 --> 02:02:10,600
That's actually so funny!

2915
02:02:14,940 --> 02:02:16,760
Bro, what the fuck!

2916
02:02:18,500 --> 02:02:19,660
I'm venting?

2917
02:02:21,320 --> 02:02:21,680
I'm...

2918
02:02:22,040 --> 02:02:23,500
Can I... I'm venting?

2919
02:02:25,620 --> 02:02:26,340
I'm...

2920
02:02:27,100 --> 02:02:27,820
Oh!

2921
02:02:29,880 --> 02:02:31,720
I am venting!

2922
02:02:33,380 --> 02:02:34,100
Oh.

2923
02:02:34,300 --> 02:02:34,940
Okay.

2924
02:02:35,100 --> 02:02:35,480
Whoops.

2925
02:02:35,720 --> 02:02:36,080
Well.

2926
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:37,720
Nevermind.

2927
02:02:38,500 --> 02:02:40,740
Wait, is that really... I forgot to...

2928
02:02:41,080 --> 02:02:43,340
I forgot to remove the boxes, guys.

2929
02:02:43,400 --> 02:02:43,800
I...

2930
02:02:45,460 --> 02:02:46,340
Never after.

2931
02:02:48,080 --> 02:02:49,100
Is he still there?

2932
02:02:51,060 --> 02:02:51,920
I hear him.

2933
02:02:53,660 --> 02:02:54,720
I hear him.

2934
02:02:58,020 --> 02:02:58,780
Oh, God.

2935
02:03:00,440 --> 02:03:02,540
How does he go back and forth from dead?

2936
02:03:02,760 --> 02:03:04,820
Maybe, like, when he's at the part-time job.

2937
02:03:05,240 --> 02:03:07,080
He, like, fucking leaves.

2938
02:03:08,480 --> 02:03:08,920
Okay.

2939
02:03:10,600 --> 02:03:11,040
Alright.

2940
02:03:12,320 --> 02:03:13,120
Alright, I'm leaving.

2941
02:03:13,780 --> 02:03:14,620
I'm leaving.

2942
02:03:14,740 --> 02:03:15,920
That is actually bullshit.

2943
02:03:16,240 --> 02:03:17,880
I can't believe!

2944
02:03:18,280 --> 02:03:22,760
I can't believe the moment I walk out the door, he was there.

2945
02:03:22,820 --> 02:03:24,020
That is so bullshit.

2946
02:03:24,260 --> 02:03:25,400
Holy shit.

2947
02:03:25,960 --> 02:03:27,700
Like, what are the odds?

2948
02:03:28,120 --> 02:03:29,400
What are the odds?

2949
02:03:29,900 --> 02:03:31,000
Oh, I should really...

2950
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:31,800
I'll fix that later.

2951
02:03:31,980 --> 02:03:35,300
I wanna go back to my ball pit time machine.

2952
02:03:35,660 --> 02:03:37,920
I don't wanna deal with that right now.

2953
02:03:40,780 --> 02:03:41,380
Okay.

2954
02:03:43,400 --> 02:03:43,720
He is!

2955
02:03:43,880 --> 02:03:45,300
He is a stream sniper!

2956
02:03:46,700 --> 02:03:48,460
I guess it goes to five nights.

2957
02:03:48,760 --> 02:03:49,940
Because we're at night number two.

2958
02:03:50,440 --> 02:03:51,640
So, like, following...

2959
02:03:51,640 --> 02:03:52,100
Oh, hey, Jeff!

2960
02:03:52,920 --> 02:03:53,580
Hey, Jeff!

2961
02:03:53,820 --> 02:03:58,360
Do you have an extra slice of pizza that you could give me?

2962
02:04:00,760 --> 02:04:01,480
Sorry, kid.

2963
02:04:01,700 --> 02:04:03,160
You know things have been tough lately.

2964
02:04:03,580 --> 02:04:06,060
You want something, you gotta buy it.

2965
02:04:06,800 --> 02:04:07,740
Oh, okay.

2966
02:04:07,740 --> 02:04:07,940
Okay.

2967
02:04:12,100 --> 02:04:13,360
What do I do now?

2968
02:04:13,880 --> 02:04:15,540
I can't afford to buy anything.

2969
02:04:16,560 --> 02:04:19,360
I could just borrow a slice from the kitchen.

2970
02:04:20,520 --> 02:04:21,000
I could just borrow a slice from the kitchen.

2971
02:04:21,080 --> 02:04:23,280
I have this random rat trap I found.

2972
02:04:23,960 --> 02:04:27,500
I bet a rat chase will get Jeff away from the door for sure.

2973
02:04:28,400 --> 02:04:28,880
Okay.

2974
02:04:29,240 --> 02:04:30,940
Where did I fucking put the rat trap?

2975
02:04:31,680 --> 02:04:33,160
Did I just put it on the ground?

2976
02:04:33,800 --> 02:04:34,860
Did I just put it on the ground?

2977
02:04:36,360 --> 02:04:37,340
Oh, no?

2978
02:04:38,180 --> 02:04:39,860
What the fuck do I do with the...

2979
02:04:40,360 --> 02:04:41,820
What do I do with the rat trap?

2980
02:04:44,400 --> 02:04:45,360
Maybe, like...

2981
02:04:46,540 --> 02:04:47,020
Just...

2982
02:04:47,520 --> 02:04:48,360
Put it here?

2983
02:04:49,940 --> 02:04:52,180
I could literally just steal the pizza from here.

2984
02:04:52,520 --> 02:04:53,460
He's not there!

2985
02:04:53,780 --> 02:04:55,040
There's pizza in there!

2986
02:04:55,180 --> 02:04:56,040
I see pizza!

2987
02:04:56,580 --> 02:04:58,260
That's a pepperoni.

2988
02:04:58,580 --> 02:05:00,740
I see a fucking pepperoni in that drawer.

2989
02:05:01,740 --> 02:05:03,620
Oh, I have to trap a rat.

2990
02:05:03,780 --> 02:05:04,100
Okay.

2991
02:05:04,380 --> 02:05:05,480
That makes more sense.

2992
02:05:08,600 --> 02:05:09,120
Wait.

2993
02:05:09,200 --> 02:05:10,240
That seems right.

2994
02:05:10,360 --> 02:05:11,940
I have to trap a rat.

2995
02:05:12,280 --> 02:05:12,560
Okay.

2996
02:05:13,580 --> 02:05:14,860
Is there any rats here?

2997
02:05:16,260 --> 02:05:17,040
Any rats?

2998
02:05:18,820 --> 02:05:20,140
Any rats in the basement?

2999
02:05:22,760 --> 02:05:24,360
How is there no rats in here?

3000
02:05:25,560 --> 02:05:27,080
Do I have to go all the way...

3001
02:05:28,100 --> 02:05:31,280
Do I have to go all the way to 1985 for my rats?

3002
02:05:34,720 --> 02:05:35,660
Oh, my God.

3003
02:05:37,340 --> 02:05:38,120
There's a rat in the ball pit.

3004
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:40,440
Rat?

3005
02:05:42,540 --> 02:05:43,940
Where the fuck are the rats?

3006
02:05:48,020 --> 02:05:48,620
Where the...

3007
02:05:48,620 --> 02:05:49,680
I got gold.

3008
02:05:50,880 --> 02:05:51,740
Maybe up here?

3009
02:05:54,800 --> 02:05:55,240
Rat?

3010
02:05:57,160 --> 02:05:58,120
Wait, that's the kitchen?

3011
02:05:58,280 --> 02:05:59,020
Oh, the door is locked.

3012
02:05:59,180 --> 02:05:59,400
Okay.

3013
02:06:00,100 --> 02:06:00,540
Rat?

3014
02:06:02,760 --> 02:06:03,520
Rat, rat, rat?

3015
02:06:04,620 --> 02:06:05,460
God damn it!

3016
02:06:05,460 --> 02:06:06,780
Why is this place so clean?

3017
02:06:09,420 --> 02:06:12,080
How dare he make this place clean?

3018
02:06:14,860 --> 02:06:16,200
Can't believe it.

3019
02:06:17,060 --> 02:06:20,900
Why does this pizzeria not violate health codes?

3020
02:06:26,140 --> 02:06:27,440
Can't believe it.

3021
02:06:28,980 --> 02:06:31,160
I don't wanna go back to the past.

3022
02:06:31,760 --> 02:06:33,440
No, there has to be...

3023
02:06:33,440 --> 02:06:36,680
Rats did not only exist in Nigeria.

3024
02:06:36,680 --> 02:06:37,840
1985, guys!

3025
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:40,880
There has to be rats in this timeline!

3026
02:06:41,620 --> 02:06:45,300
There's no way rats only existed in 1985!

3027
02:06:46,880 --> 02:06:47,640
No!

3028
02:06:51,580 --> 02:06:53,780
I can't believe it!

3029
02:06:54,500 --> 02:06:57,180
Rats have gotten extinct here!

3030
02:06:58,680 --> 02:07:01,260
Rats got extinct in this timeline.

3031
02:07:01,580 --> 02:07:03,520
In this timeline, there's no rats.

3032
02:07:07,420 --> 02:07:09,660
I forgot where we found the last rat!

3033
02:07:14,550 --> 02:07:16,130
Guys, where was the last rat?

3034
02:07:16,150 --> 02:07:16,950
I'm going back in here.

3035
02:07:17,250 --> 02:07:18,090
Guys, I forgot.

3036
02:07:18,250 --> 02:07:19,350
Where was the last rat?

3037
02:07:20,050 --> 02:07:22,670
I can't believe we had to steal a rat from the past.

3038
02:07:22,970 --> 02:07:24,350
We just got a butterfly effect!

3039
02:07:24,650 --> 02:07:26,430
What if I butterfly effect it?

3040
02:07:26,550 --> 02:07:30,010
If I bring a past rat into the current timeline...

3041
02:07:30,590 --> 02:07:34,090
What if the rat, that past rat, was supposed to like...

3042
02:07:36,230 --> 02:07:38,990
What if a war started because I told you?

3043
02:07:39,010 --> 02:07:39,750
I took the rat back!

3044
02:07:43,890 --> 02:07:45,090
The chica spot?

3045
02:07:45,330 --> 02:07:45,890
Oh, okay.

3046
02:07:45,970 --> 02:07:46,730
It's the chica spot.

3047
02:07:46,890 --> 02:07:47,110
Okay.

3048
02:07:50,370 --> 02:07:50,850
Okay.

3049
02:07:53,750 --> 02:07:54,390
Oh, wait.

3050
02:07:54,410 --> 02:07:57,110
I should like... I'm going to bring that box away, actually.

3051
02:07:58,910 --> 02:08:04,650
All I'm saying is that if I bring the rat back here in this timeline...

3052
02:08:05,810 --> 02:08:07,350
It'll cause so much issues!

3053
02:08:07,350 --> 02:08:09,890
How do I remove the boxes?

3054
02:08:10,770 --> 02:08:11,710
I'm so mad.

3055
02:08:12,750 --> 02:08:14,510
I can't even remove boxes.

3056
02:08:21,080 --> 02:08:22,020
Is he outside?

3057
02:08:23,360 --> 02:08:24,940
He's outside, isn't he?

3058
02:08:26,160 --> 02:08:27,460
But we'll just walk.

3059
02:08:29,280 --> 02:08:30,740
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah.

3060
02:08:32,080 --> 02:08:33,080
Woah, woah, woah.

3061
02:08:35,460 --> 02:08:36,960
Oh, that's where chica is.

3062
02:08:37,280 --> 02:08:37,980
Alright, guys.

3063
02:08:38,120 --> 02:08:39,340
Get ready to die here.

3064
02:08:42,060 --> 02:08:42,900
There's the rat!

3065
02:08:44,320 --> 02:08:45,200
There's the rat!

3066
02:08:45,440 --> 02:08:46,820
Where are you going, you rat?

3067
02:08:50,380 --> 02:08:51,900
Nothing will come out while I'm standing.

3068
02:08:51,960 --> 02:08:53,100
I better leave so it comes back.

3069
02:08:53,240 --> 02:08:53,460
Alright.

3070
02:08:54,620 --> 02:08:55,140
Alright.

3071
02:08:55,200 --> 02:08:56,160
Gotta get my rat.

3072
02:08:59,420 --> 02:08:59,940
Yeah!

3073
02:08:59,940 --> 02:09:03,660
I'm gonna bring you fly affected!

3074
02:09:04,720 --> 02:09:06,520
It's time for the butterfly effect!

3075
02:09:07,960 --> 02:09:10,980
I come back and America loses the state.

3076
02:09:11,180 --> 02:09:12,100
It's now...

3077
02:09:12,100 --> 02:09:12,780
Hahaha!

3078
02:09:13,840 --> 02:09:15,020
I come back.

3079
02:09:15,020 --> 02:09:16,160
And we don't have...

3080
02:09:16,160 --> 02:09:18,540
We lost Alaska.

3081
02:09:19,120 --> 02:09:19,580
Hahaha!

3082
02:09:22,080 --> 02:09:24,460
In fact, he's like, Alaska never existed.

3083
02:09:24,600 --> 02:09:25,540
What are you talking about?

3084
02:09:28,240 --> 02:09:30,300
Alaska is now owned by Canada.

3085
02:09:31,020 --> 02:09:31,480
Alright.

3086
02:09:32,560 --> 02:09:33,020
Alright.

3087
02:09:33,220 --> 02:09:35,080
Okay, so I have to...

3088
02:09:37,100 --> 02:09:38,440
I'm just gonna talk to him.

3089
02:09:38,520 --> 02:09:38,860
You're late.

3090
02:09:38,960 --> 02:09:40,440
We don't sell slices after lunch.

3091
02:09:40,600 --> 02:09:41,480
So you want pizza?

3092
02:09:41,560 --> 02:09:42,880
You gotta buy a whole pie.

3093
02:09:42,880 --> 02:09:45,260
Oh, um, I'm good for now.

3094
02:09:46,640 --> 02:09:48,240
Okay, do I just like...

3095
02:09:48,940 --> 02:09:51,440
Oh, I guess I'll put the rat near her.

3096
02:09:51,880 --> 02:09:53,020
Because I'm a bitch.

3097
02:09:53,700 --> 02:09:54,140
Wait.

3098
02:09:54,740 --> 02:09:55,940
Put the rat near her.

3099
02:09:57,980 --> 02:09:58,960
Oh, that it is.

3100
02:09:59,060 --> 02:10:00,920
Oh, that should be enough to distract Jeff.

3101
02:10:02,720 --> 02:10:04,340
Texas becomes its own nation.

3102
02:10:04,820 --> 02:10:05,260
Hahaha!

3103
02:10:10,140 --> 02:10:12,700
Doki, Springtrap is working 9 to 5 as your dad.

3104
02:10:12,700 --> 02:10:14,380
And you worry a rat will affect this.

3105
02:10:14,780 --> 02:10:15,860
Neil, thank you.

3106
02:10:16,100 --> 02:10:17,720
Super chat, thank you, thank you.

3107
02:10:18,080 --> 02:10:19,040
Oh, rat!

3108
02:10:19,460 --> 02:10:20,780
It's a dirty rat!

3109
02:10:21,240 --> 02:10:23,180
Excuse me, I'm Oswald.

3110
02:10:23,780 --> 02:10:24,840
You're right, town.

3111
02:10:24,940 --> 02:10:26,460
You picked the wrong place, pal.

3112
02:10:28,760 --> 02:10:30,300
Alright, you should be distracted.

3113
02:10:31,220 --> 02:10:32,500
The kitchen should be free now.

3114
02:10:32,640 --> 02:10:36,180
I just have to sneak in, grab pizza, and hurry out before Jeff comes out.

3115
02:10:36,340 --> 02:10:37,160
Yeah, let me sneak in.

3116
02:10:38,360 --> 02:10:39,660
Let me sneak in.

3117
02:10:39,820 --> 02:10:40,340
I'm sne...

3118
02:10:40,340 --> 02:10:40,960
Hahaha!

3119
02:10:42,700 --> 02:10:43,080
I'm sneaking!

3120
02:10:43,220 --> 02:10:43,540
I'm sneaking!

3121
02:10:44,120 --> 02:10:44,760
Let's go!

3122
02:10:45,920 --> 02:10:46,680
There you go.

3123
02:10:46,720 --> 02:10:47,380
I got us a slice of pizza.

3124
02:10:48,700 --> 02:10:49,720
Sneaking successful.

3125
02:10:52,640 --> 02:10:55,760
Alright, very sneaky.

3126
02:10:56,820 --> 02:10:57,840
I'm so sneaky.

3127
02:11:00,120 --> 02:11:00,680
Alright.

3128
02:11:01,680 --> 02:11:03,360
Time to get caught by...

3129
02:11:03,360 --> 02:11:04,520
Caught by dad.

3130
02:11:05,740 --> 02:11:06,300
Oh.

3131
02:11:07,640 --> 02:11:10,320
There's no way Springtrap is not outside right now.

3132
02:11:11,280 --> 02:11:12,280
There's no way.

3133
02:11:12,280 --> 02:11:13,980
He's gonna come out that door.

3134
02:11:14,020 --> 02:11:15,060
He's gonna fucking kill me.

3135
02:11:16,440 --> 02:11:17,500
There's no way.

3136
02:11:18,300 --> 02:11:20,240
Okay, I keep forgetting it's this door.

3137
02:11:21,780 --> 02:11:22,300
Alright.

3138
02:11:23,120 --> 02:11:23,640
Springtrap!

3139
02:11:27,710 --> 02:11:28,230
Springtrap!

3140
02:11:30,330 --> 02:11:32,470
I hate walking but I have to.

3141
02:11:33,970 --> 02:11:36,350
Not exactly how I imagined feeding a chicken.

3142
02:11:40,010 --> 02:11:40,530
Alright.

3143
02:11:40,670 --> 02:11:41,510
I go here?

3144
02:11:43,750 --> 02:11:44,970
Hello, Chica.

3145
02:11:46,830 --> 02:11:48,990
You want a little pizza?

3146
02:11:50,150 --> 02:11:53,490
I guess I'll go when she gets out.

3147
02:11:59,090 --> 02:12:00,770
When the spring shot comes out right here.

3148
02:12:02,450 --> 02:12:06,070
Whoa, there's a phone!

3149
02:12:07,190 --> 02:12:07,570
Hello?

3150
02:12:11,640 --> 02:12:13,160
I am?

3151
02:12:20,600 --> 02:12:21,280
What is it?

3152
02:12:21,280 --> 02:12:21,820
Phone guy?

3153
02:12:24,620 --> 02:12:25,740
Oh, thank you.

3154
02:12:26,100 --> 02:12:27,160
Thanks for the tip.

3155
02:12:28,880 --> 02:12:29,880
Oh, I can move!

3156
02:12:30,060 --> 02:12:31,080
Oh, I should have been moving!

3157
02:12:31,320 --> 02:12:33,580
Oh, shit!

3158
02:12:38,350 --> 02:12:38,870
Mike!

3159
02:12:39,150 --> 02:12:39,670
Us?

3160
02:12:40,510 --> 02:12:41,490
Is it gone?

3161
02:12:43,030 --> 02:12:43,870
For now.

3162
02:12:44,370 --> 02:12:45,510
Let's get to the exit.

3163
02:12:46,770 --> 02:12:47,970
I found him!

3164
02:12:48,210 --> 02:12:49,430
Right towards Chica!

3165
02:12:49,630 --> 02:12:50,210
You go!

3166
02:12:53,730 --> 02:12:54,250
Yeah!

3167
02:12:54,490 --> 02:12:56,630
Right towards Chica!

3168
02:12:59,190 --> 02:13:00,230
Alright, I'm walking.

3169
02:13:00,430 --> 02:13:01,890
I'm fucking walking through this.

3170
02:13:02,170 --> 02:13:03,810
I'm too scared to run now.

3171
02:13:04,730 --> 02:13:09,670
Like, I know this is too deep, but this game is actually pretty, like, anxiety, you know?

3172
02:13:11,110 --> 02:13:11,630
Mike!

3173
02:13:13,150 --> 02:13:13,950
Or Chip!

3174
02:13:15,250 --> 02:13:15,970
Aren't you...

3175
02:13:15,970 --> 02:13:16,890
Aren't you coming?

3176
02:13:17,690 --> 02:13:19,270
No, I'm looking for my dad.

3177
02:13:20,930 --> 02:13:23,890
He's wearing a blue shirt and has brown hair.

3178
02:13:24,170 --> 02:13:25,410
Have you seen him?

3179
02:13:26,250 --> 02:13:28,090
Have you seen my dad?

3180
02:13:29,330 --> 02:13:29,970
Nope.

3181
02:13:29,970 --> 02:13:30,990
Have you seen Chip?

3182
02:13:31,150 --> 02:13:33,510
Well, you were in the arcade when the power went out.

3183
02:13:34,270 --> 02:13:35,970
No, I haven't.

3184
02:13:36,110 --> 02:13:39,050
Do you think he's...

3185
02:13:39,050 --> 02:13:40,530
Oh, shit!

3186
02:13:40,870 --> 02:13:41,190
Oh!

3187
02:13:41,730 --> 02:13:42,190
Mike

3188
02:13:46,050 --> 02:13:46,750
fucking...

3189
02:13:46,750 --> 02:13:47,910
He actually...

3190
02:13:47,910 --> 02:13:50,390
He actually ran, that little fucker!

3191
02:13:50,750 --> 02:13:53,110
Oh, shit!

3192
02:13:53,110 --> 02:13:55,510
Oh, my God!

3193
02:13:55,970 --> 02:13:56,410
What?!

3194
02:13:59,810 --> 02:14:01,430
That's fucked!

3195
02:14:04,270 --> 02:14:06,530
He actually ran!

3196
02:14:10,030 --> 02:14:11,790
That fucker!

3197
02:14:12,290 --> 02:14:14,890
I don't remember what this mini-game was.

3198
02:14:16,570 --> 02:14:17,450
Oh!

3199
02:14:17,750 --> 02:14:18,770
I knew it!

3200
02:14:18,770 --> 02:14:19,770
The flashlight worked!

3201
02:14:22,110 --> 02:14:22,990
Oh!

3202
02:14:23,110 --> 02:14:23,950
What the fuck!

3203
02:14:24,030 --> 02:14:25,210
Why is Chica still there?!

3204
02:14:27,870 --> 02:14:30,870
I knew the flashlight actually does something!

3205
02:14:31,290 --> 02:14:32,350
Back to my...

3206
02:14:32,350 --> 02:14:34,150
My ball pit time machine!

3207
02:14:34,390 --> 02:14:35,990
I keep trying to say hot tub time machine.

3208
02:14:39,610 --> 02:14:41,630
Man, that was too close.

3209
02:14:42,810 --> 02:14:44,310
I cannot find him.

3210
02:14:44,530 --> 02:14:45,530
Where have I looked?

3211
02:14:45,650 --> 02:14:45,970
I don't know.

3212
02:14:46,050 --> 02:14:46,470
Outside?

3213
02:14:47,070 --> 02:14:48,090
Like, Cosmo.

3214
02:14:48,330 --> 02:14:49,650
We can look outside.

3215
02:14:50,610 --> 02:14:52,130
Me pee's at the mill!

3216
02:14:52,530 --> 02:14:53,090
Oh, my God!

3217
02:14:53,890 --> 02:14:55,950
But Mike, I know will never run away.

3218
02:14:56,090 --> 02:14:58,190
Oswald, you know me for like 10 minutes.

3219
02:14:58,490 --> 02:14:59,930
Dory, thank you for the super chat.

3220
02:15:00,030 --> 02:15:00,330
Thank you.

3221
02:15:00,470 --> 02:15:00,810
Thank you.

3222
02:15:00,910 --> 02:15:01,370
All right.

3223
02:15:01,370 --> 02:15:02,370
Time to go home.

3224
02:15:03,950 --> 02:15:05,210
Time to go home.

3225
02:15:06,990 --> 02:15:07,650
All right.

3226
02:15:07,930 --> 02:15:08,590
Oswald's house.

3227
02:15:08,950 --> 02:15:09,770
Day 3.

3228
02:15:13,090 --> 02:15:15,570
What the fuck happened to my window?!

3229
02:15:16,630 --> 02:15:17,070
Mom!

3230
02:15:17,230 --> 02:15:18,770
Isn't this weird, Mom?!

3231
02:15:18,770 --> 02:15:20,290
Like, what?!

3232
02:15:20,290 --> 02:15:22,730
How did Mom allow this?!

3233
02:15:22,730 --> 02:15:23,090
Oh, my God!

3234
02:15:25,250 --> 02:15:26,550
What can I...

3235
02:15:26,550 --> 02:15:29,250
Hello, Dad.

3236
02:15:29,930 --> 02:15:30,910
Goodbye, Dad.

3237
02:15:31,330 --> 02:15:34,210
What does it want now?!

3238
02:15:34,210 --> 02:15:37,530
How the fuck did my mom allow this?!

3239
02:15:40,090 --> 02:15:40,690
Understand!

3240
02:15:41,190 --> 02:15:42,590
It got pointed...

3241
02:15:42,590 --> 02:15:42,790
Mom!

3242
02:15:43,590 --> 02:15:45,170
Dad pointed it out!

3243
02:15:45,930 --> 02:15:48,670
Isn't that fucking weird, Mom?!

3244
02:15:48,670 --> 02:15:51,090
Like, Toki, go pet the cat, dude.

3245
02:15:51,630 --> 02:15:53,210
Not because they give you the super chat.

3246
02:15:53,290 --> 02:15:53,750
They give you the...

3247
02:15:53,750 --> 02:15:54,750
That's weird!

3248
02:15:54,770 --> 02:15:55,950
Isn't it, Mom?!

3249
02:15:56,310 --> 02:15:57,090
Isn't this weird?!

3250
02:15:57,770 --> 02:15:59,650
I thought this was weird!

3251
02:16:04,670 --> 02:16:06,930
Already followed that thing once.

3252
02:16:07,190 --> 02:16:09,150
Didn't go so well last time.

3253
02:16:09,590 --> 02:16:11,130
This is fine.

3254
02:16:11,490 --> 02:16:12,210
Mom!

3255
02:16:12,570 --> 02:16:14,990
Isn't this weird, Mom?!

3256
02:16:14,990 --> 02:16:16,150
Mom?

3257
02:16:17,390 --> 02:16:18,110
Mom?

3258
02:16:18,790 --> 02:16:19,730
Where's Mom?

3259
02:16:21,270 --> 02:16:21,990
Mom?

3260
02:16:22,130 --> 02:16:23,510
Good morning, Oswald.

3261
02:16:23,730 --> 02:16:24,590
Are you ready for...

3262
02:16:24,590 --> 02:16:24,750
Mom?!

3263
02:16:24,750 --> 02:16:26,110
Dad boarded the windows!

3264
02:16:30,570 --> 02:16:33,470
Oswald, tell your mom he boarded the windows!

3265
02:16:34,130 --> 02:16:36,030
I think I'll just eat at school today.

3266
02:16:36,290 --> 02:16:37,230
If that's okay.

3267
02:16:38,390 --> 02:16:39,130
Sure, hon.

3268
02:16:39,550 --> 02:16:41,290
Have you made any friends yet?

3269
02:16:42,070 --> 02:16:45,730
Well, there is this one guy I can't seem to get away from.

3270
02:16:46,710 --> 02:16:49,050
Now, Os, that's not very nice.

3271
02:16:49,390 --> 02:16:51,350
Maybe he just wants to be your friend.

3272
02:16:52,830 --> 02:16:53,370
Eh...

3273
02:16:55,110 --> 02:16:57,810
In any case, it's only your second day.

3274
02:16:58,050 --> 02:16:58,970
I'll get better.

3275
02:16:59,450 --> 02:16:59,890
Mom!

3276
02:17:00,090 --> 02:17:02,490
Can we talk about my boarded windows?!

3277
02:17:04,530 --> 02:17:05,350
Yeah, babe.

3278
02:17:05,450 --> 02:17:06,730
Welcome to the tomato farm.

3279
02:17:06,810 --> 02:17:07,430
Welcome, welcome.

3280
02:17:07,830 --> 02:17:10,110
You just have to take it one step at a time.

3281
02:17:10,610 --> 02:17:11,130
Okay!

3282
02:17:11,930 --> 02:17:14,090
Time to, I guess, go to school.

3283
02:17:15,010 --> 02:17:20,970
I guess Mom does not fucking care that, like, you know, my windows are boarded up.

3284
02:17:21,110 --> 02:17:21,830
Hey, Dad.

3285
02:17:22,370 --> 02:17:22,890
Hey, Dad.

3286
02:17:22,890 --> 02:17:22,910
Hey, Dad.

3287
02:17:27,020 --> 02:17:27,540
Hey, Dad.

3288
02:17:27,560 --> 02:17:31,740
You might be a big sixth grader now, but you can't outrun a mom smooch.

3289
02:17:32,220 --> 02:17:34,360
Please, Mom, not in front of the animatronic.

3290
02:17:39,840 --> 02:17:41,580
Be good today, Oswald.

3291
02:17:42,220 --> 02:17:44,920
Remember that Dad and I are always here for you.

3292
02:17:45,800 --> 02:17:46,280
Okay.

3293
02:17:48,760 --> 02:17:50,940
Dad, do you want to give me a smooch too?

3294
02:17:51,420 --> 02:17:51,900
No?

3295
02:17:52,100 --> 02:17:52,580
Okay.

3296
02:17:55,640 --> 02:17:56,120
Okay.

3297
02:17:56,720 --> 02:17:59,140
I wish you would believe me about Dad.

3298
02:18:02,910 --> 02:18:03,550
All right.

3299
02:18:03,570 --> 02:18:03,990
Let's go.

3300
02:18:05,230 --> 02:18:06,470
Sapphire, thank you for the super chat.

3301
02:18:06,530 --> 02:18:06,810
Thank you.

3302
02:18:06,830 --> 02:18:07,410
Thank you.

3303
02:18:07,590 --> 02:18:10,990
Swing trap entering the room like a tired, tired Dad.

3304
02:18:11,630 --> 02:18:14,150
I mean, he still has to go to 7-Eleven.

3305
02:18:15,410 --> 02:18:15,990
All right.

3306
02:18:16,050 --> 02:18:16,650
Day three.

3307
02:18:16,690 --> 02:18:18,070
Everybody loves our pizza.

3308
02:18:18,350 --> 02:18:19,330
Especially Chica.

3309
02:18:22,830 --> 02:18:23,270
Ha!

3310
02:18:23,870 --> 02:18:25,610
Is Oswald the ocelot?

3311
02:18:25,670 --> 02:18:27,590
Looking for a place to molt?

3312
02:18:29,050 --> 02:18:31,270
Ocelot doesn't even do that, Dylan.

3313
02:18:31,830 --> 02:18:34,890
This is why you can't read when we're in sixth grade.

3314
02:18:35,170 --> 02:18:40,050
I bet you Dylan is, like, that kid that got held back three grades and he's, like, actually 17.

3315
02:18:40,510 --> 02:18:43,750
Like, I guess you'd be the expert.

3316
02:18:44,790 --> 02:18:45,770
Wait, he is.

3317
02:18:45,890 --> 02:18:46,290
He could...

3318
02:18:46,290 --> 02:18:46,490
Oh!

3319
02:18:46,690 --> 02:18:48,330
He's, like, taller than him too.

3320
02:18:48,690 --> 02:18:50,190
He's definitely held back.

3321
02:18:50,290 --> 02:18:51,630
He's, like, taller than Oswald.

3322
02:18:52,050 --> 02:18:54,590
I got way bigger problems than you today.

3323
02:18:56,110 --> 02:18:57,370
He's, like, 21.

3324
02:19:02,950 --> 02:19:03,810
Am I gonna...

3325
02:19:03,810 --> 02:19:04,310
Oh, what?

3326
02:19:04,650 --> 02:19:05,950
Oh, I'm fucking...

3327
02:19:05,950 --> 02:19:07,750
Did not take my meds.

3328
02:19:08,410 --> 02:19:09,650
What's the matter, Oswald?

3329
02:19:12,730 --> 02:19:14,210
Nothing, Mrs. Meechum.

3330
02:19:14,450 --> 02:19:16,810
I just can't focus, I guess.

3331
02:19:18,030 --> 02:19:19,770
Maybe you need to stretch your legs.

3332
02:19:20,610 --> 02:19:22,850
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

3333
02:19:22,950 --> 02:19:23,390
And if you...

3334
02:19:24,270 --> 02:19:25,350
To clear your mind.

3335
02:19:26,350 --> 02:19:27,350
I left a book behind.

3336
02:19:27,350 --> 02:19:28,490
I left a book behind in the principal's office.

3337
02:19:28,710 --> 02:19:30,210
Would you mind getting it for me?

3338
02:19:30,950 --> 02:19:31,850
All right, let's go.

3339
02:19:32,830 --> 02:19:34,730
Let's go grab the...

3340
02:19:35,870 --> 02:19:37,270
Let's go grab the book.

3341
02:19:37,490 --> 02:19:40,470
How can I save dad if I can barely even get through school?

3342
02:19:41,110 --> 02:19:41,950
Come on, Os.

3343
02:19:42,170 --> 02:19:44,690
Like mom said, one step at a time.

3344
02:19:45,010 --> 02:19:45,750
All right.

3345
02:19:46,310 --> 02:19:46,970
Let's see.

3346
02:19:48,490 --> 02:19:50,030
Is the VTuber kid here now?

3347
02:19:51,510 --> 02:19:54,730
No, because everybody's a good student and they're not walking around.

3348
02:19:55,670 --> 02:19:56,510
Oh, principal!

3349
02:19:56,690 --> 02:19:57,330
I need a book!

3350
02:19:57,350 --> 02:19:58,210
Can I grab a book?

3351
02:19:59,190 --> 02:20:01,370
Hey, what are you doing outside class?

3352
02:20:02,050 --> 02:20:05,230
Um, I'm getting a book for Mrs. Meechum.

3353
02:20:05,810 --> 02:20:06,990
No, you're not, kid.

3354
02:20:07,270 --> 02:20:09,030
You're helping me find the key to my...

3355
02:20:09,030 --> 02:20:10,430
Okay, side quest time.

3356
02:20:11,070 --> 02:20:11,590
Huh?

3357
02:20:12,190 --> 02:20:15,130
I got locked out of my office when I went to get...

3358
02:20:15,130 --> 02:20:17,450
When I went to oversee student behavior.

3359
02:20:18,570 --> 02:20:20,050
Um, I'll look around.

3360
02:20:20,650 --> 02:20:22,130
You're a lifesaver, little...

3361
02:20:22,130 --> 02:20:23,310
Oh, this is definitely a public school.

3362
02:20:23,950 --> 02:20:24,550
There's like...

3363
02:20:24,550 --> 02:20:25,550
Where's the janitor?

3364
02:20:25,850 --> 02:20:27,070
Why is there a spider?

3365
02:20:27,350 --> 02:20:27,450
Right here.

3366
02:20:29,930 --> 02:20:31,050
Oh, yeah.

3367
02:20:31,150 --> 02:20:32,110
No, 100%.

3368
02:20:32,950 --> 02:20:36,110
Why are there spiders walking around here?

3369
02:20:39,290 --> 02:20:40,530
Door is locked.

3370
02:20:41,570 --> 02:20:42,410
Oh, my God.

3371
02:20:43,150 --> 02:20:45,170
School is falling apart right now.

3372
02:20:45,210 --> 02:20:46,530
I think they fired the janitor.

3373
02:20:47,010 --> 02:20:48,070
I'm pretty sure.

3374
02:20:48,630 --> 02:20:51,310
Like, nothing seems to be cleaned right now.

3375
02:20:56,250 --> 02:20:56,810
Like...

3376
02:20:56,810 --> 02:20:59,410
Even the walls look fucking dirty.

3377
02:20:59,690 --> 02:21:00,570
Oh, there's the keys.

3378
02:21:00,870 --> 02:21:01,810
Wait, why are the keys here?

3379
02:21:02,230 --> 02:21:03,250
In this classroom.

3380
02:21:08,450 --> 02:21:10,690
Miss principal, what were you doing in this classroom?

3381
02:21:13,070 --> 02:21:14,170
Eating her snack.

3382
02:21:14,270 --> 02:21:14,750
I forgot.

3383
02:21:14,930 --> 02:21:16,130
Wait, so she like...

3384
02:21:16,130 --> 02:21:17,110
Wait, this pr...

3385
02:21:17,110 --> 02:21:17,550
Wait.

3386
02:21:18,530 --> 02:21:20,730
The school has like two classrooms.

3387
02:21:22,070 --> 02:21:22,550
Like...

3388
02:21:24,570 --> 02:21:29,710
I just realized the school literally has two classrooms and that's it.

3389
02:21:30,290 --> 02:21:32,210
This is not a very good school.

3390
02:21:32,710 --> 02:21:34,130
This is not.

3391
02:21:36,750 --> 02:21:37,410
Let's see.

3392
02:21:37,490 --> 02:21:38,250
Here you go, principal.

3393
02:21:40,410 --> 02:21:40,990
Whoa.

3394
02:21:41,170 --> 02:21:43,050
The school only has like...

3395
02:21:43,050 --> 02:21:45,690
This public school is only sixth grade.

3396
02:21:45,850 --> 02:21:46,990
Every grade you go...

3397
02:21:46,990 --> 02:21:50,970
Every grade you have to go to a new school.

3398
02:21:52,650 --> 02:21:53,150
Whoa.

3399
02:21:53,410 --> 02:21:54,690
Where did you find...

3400
02:21:54,690 --> 02:21:55,110
My name.

3401
02:21:55,390 --> 02:21:56,070
You know...

3402
02:21:56,070 --> 02:21:58,330
I searched almost every room in the school.

3403
02:21:58,410 --> 02:21:59,290
There's two rooms.

3404
02:22:00,170 --> 02:22:02,350
What do you mean I searched every...

3405
02:22:02,350 --> 02:22:03,210
There's two rooms.

3406
02:22:04,930 --> 02:22:05,670
We're lucky.

3407
02:22:07,170 --> 02:22:08,430
Exactly, Oswald.

3408
02:22:08,570 --> 02:22:09,200
There's two rooms.

3409
02:22:11,130 --> 02:22:12,630
Almost every school?

3410
02:22:15,070 --> 02:22:16,410
I better be off now.

3411
02:22:16,730 --> 02:22:18,570
I think I heard someone calling for me in the...

3412
02:22:18,570 --> 02:22:19,150
There's a cafeteria.

3413
02:22:19,330 --> 02:22:20,050
Where's the cafeteria?

3414
02:22:21,730 --> 02:22:22,930
It's at like the school...

3415
02:22:22,930 --> 02:22:26,410
The cafeteria is like at a different address.

3416
02:22:26,730 --> 02:22:28,110
Like it's in a different school.

3417
02:22:28,210 --> 02:22:31,970
So the principal has to like travel to a different school for the cafeteria.

3418
02:22:33,910 --> 02:22:34,350
Cafeteria?

3419
02:22:34,510 --> 02:22:34,950
Where?

3420
02:22:36,150 --> 02:22:37,030
Wait, what's this?

3421
02:22:37,890 --> 02:22:41,170
Dad will come for his parent here, but that thing will come to those.

3422
02:22:41,210 --> 02:22:41,990
You don't know that.

3423
02:22:42,250 --> 02:22:44,010
Wait, what is that on the table?

3424
02:22:45,170 --> 02:22:46,890
What if dad comes to the...

3425
02:22:48,450 --> 02:22:48,890
Dad...

3426
02:22:48,890 --> 02:22:49,630
Dad...

3427
02:22:49,630 --> 02:22:49,910
Dad...

3428
02:22:49,910 --> 02:22:50,030
Dad...

3429
02:22:50,050 --> 02:22:52,870
The animatronic goes to the fucking parent-teacher conference.

3430
02:22:53,070 --> 02:22:53,670
You don't know that.

3431
02:22:54,330 --> 02:22:56,170
Finally, now I can get back to class.

3432
02:22:56,990 --> 02:22:58,010
What is that?

3433
02:22:58,850 --> 02:23:00,010
Yeah, wait, what's that?

3434
02:23:01,990 --> 02:23:04,130
Dad teach Dylan not to mess with me.

3435
02:23:04,610 --> 02:23:05,830
Wait, what the fuck did...

3436
02:23:05,830 --> 02:23:06,990
Oh, is that the little...

3437
02:23:06,990 --> 02:23:08,370
The hand thing?

3438
02:23:09,070 --> 02:23:10,090
What is that?

3439
02:23:10,390 --> 02:23:11,130
Oh, is it...

3440
02:23:11,130 --> 02:23:12,150
Yeah, it's the stretchy hands.

3441
02:23:12,290 --> 02:23:12,630
Yeah.

3442
02:23:14,030 --> 02:23:16,110
The cafeteria is the pizza place.

3443
02:23:16,190 --> 02:23:17,270
These kids are screwed.

3444
02:23:17,630 --> 02:23:18,110
Yeah.

3445
02:23:18,950 --> 02:23:21,230
There's only like a cafeteria.

3446
02:23:22,290 --> 02:23:24,830
The cafeteria is literally the pizza...

3447
02:23:24,830 --> 02:23:25,610
It's Jeff's pizza.

3448
02:23:27,390 --> 02:23:29,730
You certainly took your time, Oswald.

3449
02:23:29,990 --> 02:23:31,970
Sorry, I had like a side quest.

3450
02:23:33,090 --> 02:23:34,250
Sorry, Ms. Mecham.

3451
02:23:34,410 --> 02:23:35,530
I don't really need that...

3452
02:23:35,850 --> 02:23:36,550
Why lie?

3453
02:23:37,170 --> 02:23:40,060
Just tell them about an alibi.

3454
02:23:40,340 --> 02:23:41,280
Why lie?

3455
02:23:41,940 --> 02:23:43,880
It's even a good alibi.

3456
02:23:44,400 --> 02:23:46,780
You literally had an adult witness you.

3457
02:23:53,750 --> 02:23:55,130
I'll see you tomorrow, class.

3458
02:23:55,670 --> 02:23:57,410
Make sure you're writing your essays.

3459
02:23:59,730 --> 02:24:00,190
Alibi?

3460
02:24:00,290 --> 02:24:01,390
Like, why lie?

3461
02:24:02,350 --> 02:24:05,950
Literally have an alibi with the fucking principal.

3462
02:24:07,510 --> 02:24:08,170
All right.

3463
02:24:08,470 --> 02:24:09,290
YouTuber kid?

3464
02:24:10,170 --> 02:24:11,390
All right, we don't care.

3465
02:24:11,570 --> 02:24:14,210
I don't care about random conversations with you, child.

3466
02:24:15,950 --> 02:24:16,570
All right.

3467
02:24:16,650 --> 02:24:17,190
How about you?

3468
02:24:17,230 --> 02:24:17,650
Who are you?

3469
02:24:18,150 --> 02:24:19,190
Okay, I don't care.

3470
02:24:20,790 --> 02:24:22,210
You don't matter to me.

3471
02:24:23,530 --> 02:24:25,090
Where are all the other children?

3472
02:24:25,590 --> 02:24:27,250
But there's ants here too.

3473
02:24:27,350 --> 02:24:27,950
Oh, gross.

3474
02:24:29,050 --> 02:24:31,450
Who still has their backpack over there?

3475
02:24:32,950 --> 02:24:34,170
Not VTuber kid.

3476
02:24:34,270 --> 02:24:35,270
Not worth it.

3477
02:24:37,290 --> 02:24:38,010
VTuber kid?

3478
02:24:38,270 --> 02:24:40,010
Oh, I literally just talked to you.

3479
02:24:40,310 --> 02:24:41,050
VTuber kid?

3480
02:24:41,610 --> 02:24:42,590
No, I don't.

3481
02:24:42,590 --> 02:24:43,690
I don't care about you.

3482
02:24:44,830 --> 02:24:45,630
VTuber kid?

3483
02:24:46,090 --> 02:24:47,330
God damn it.

3484
02:24:47,490 --> 02:24:49,210
Wait, did they do okay in volleyball though?

3485
02:24:50,050 --> 02:24:51,110
Oh, good job.

3486
02:24:51,290 --> 02:24:51,810
Congratulate.

3487
02:24:51,810 --> 02:24:54,950
Look, it's VTuber kid and the volleyball team.

3488
02:24:56,650 --> 02:24:57,950
Renfield, bring your own blood.

3489
02:24:58,050 --> 02:24:59,050
It's such a fun game.

3490
02:24:59,290 --> 02:25:00,050
It's super cool.

3491
02:25:00,290 --> 02:25:02,950
I know how I feel about eating bugs in real life to level up though.

3492
02:25:03,310 --> 02:25:04,710
What about the recovering chocolate?

3493
02:25:05,070 --> 02:25:06,030
Oh, now we're talking.

3494
02:25:06,150 --> 02:25:11,110
Look, I'm very committed to the volleyball team and the school.

3495
02:25:12,430 --> 02:25:14,110
Look, I want to know how they did.

3496
02:25:14,730 --> 02:25:17,570
I just want to make sure they made it to the finals.

3497
02:25:19,690 --> 02:25:22,270
Bro, where the fuck is the VTuber child?

3498
02:25:23,230 --> 02:25:23,990
VTuber kid?

3499
02:25:24,330 --> 02:25:26,090
No, okay, I talked to you already.

3500
02:25:26,210 --> 02:25:27,090
Okay, I don't think he's.

3501
02:25:27,830 --> 02:25:30,150
I hope they made it to the finals.

3502
02:25:30,170 --> 02:25:31,650
They made it through preliminaries.

3503
02:25:32,650 --> 02:25:36,310
And Toki shoved it to the lockers.

3504
02:25:38,490 --> 02:25:40,610
No, Toki even uses these lockers.

3505
02:25:42,350 --> 02:25:45,110
Is... he's not in the lockers.

3506
02:25:45,390 --> 02:25:47,550
He's not in the lockers.

3507
02:25:48,150 --> 02:25:50,470
There's no way he fits in there!

3508
02:25:51,010 --> 02:25:51,570
Okay.

3509
02:25:52,450 --> 02:25:53,410
Alright, we're out.

3510
02:25:53,910 --> 02:25:57,270
Guys, I think I'm- I'm- I have good- I'm making good progress.

3511
02:25:57,710 --> 02:25:58,670
I'm pretty sure.

3512
02:25:58,830 --> 02:25:59,730
Alright, we leave.

3513
02:26:00,970 --> 02:26:02,250
At least we checked.

3514
02:26:02,750 --> 02:26:03,650
I did!

3515
02:26:03,790 --> 02:26:05,270
I did check, guys.

3516
02:26:05,750 --> 02:26:06,310
Alright.

3517
02:26:09,030 --> 02:26:10,990
There's literally two rooms, guys.

3518
02:26:11,270 --> 02:26:13,830
There's no other room I'd be in.

3519
02:26:14,230 --> 02:26:16,410
There's only two rooms.

3520
02:26:17,950 --> 02:26:20,210
We've established that together.

3521
02:26:20,710 --> 02:26:21,750
Alright, night three.

3522
02:26:21,970 --> 02:26:23,010
Two more nights left.

3523
02:26:24,330 --> 02:26:29,570
Is this game longer than- Longer than two- five nights?

3524
02:26:30,810 --> 02:26:31,830
Like, mom!

3525
02:26:32,410 --> 02:26:33,870
Is this not weird, mom?

3526
02:26:37,020 --> 02:26:37,580
Okay.

3527
02:26:38,780 --> 02:26:41,920
We have to find a way to escape.

3528
02:26:42,020 --> 02:26:43,940
I mean, we just go down, left, down.

3529
02:26:46,040 --> 02:26:46,600
Alright.

3530
02:26:50,480 --> 02:26:51,080
Here we go.

3531
02:26:52,280 --> 02:26:53,280
We walk.

3532
02:26:55,800 --> 02:26:56,820
Whoa, shit!

3533
02:26:57,360 --> 02:26:58,440
Open the door!

3534
02:26:59,200 --> 02:27:00,120
Lily, run!

3535
02:27:00,500 --> 02:27:01,540
Lily, run!

3536
02:27:02,000 --> 02:27:03,400
We're- we're there!

3537
02:27:03,840 --> 02:27:06,820
Wait, are you- What is going on?

3538
02:27:09,660 --> 02:27:11,140
What do you mean?

3539
02:27:11,240 --> 02:27:12,860
I can't open the door?

3540
02:27:13,080 --> 02:27:14,160
I just stopped.

3541
02:27:14,220 --> 02:27:16,160
I just forgot how to open doors, apparently.

3542
02:27:16,960 --> 02:27:18,060
I just stopped.

3543
02:27:18,420 --> 02:27:19,060
I just forgot how to open doors, apparently.

3544
02:27:19,240 --> 02:27:20,460
I'm so sorry.

3545
02:27:20,480 --> 02:27:24,120
Like, I fucking lost my poseable thumbs, apparently.

3546
02:27:28,200 --> 02:27:30,660
Like, what the fuck happened to my arms?

3547
02:27:30,920 --> 02:27:31,560
Like...

3548
02:27:32,500 --> 02:27:36,380
I couldn't reach my hands to sway.

3549
02:27:37,340 --> 02:27:39,900
Like, what the fuck happened to my hands?

3550
02:27:40,780 --> 02:27:44,820
I literally had one job and it was door open.

3551
02:27:44,980 --> 02:27:46,140
Door in.

3552
02:27:49,120 --> 02:27:50,460
Oh my god.

3553
02:27:51,520 --> 02:27:51,960
Okay.

3554
02:27:53,960 --> 02:27:55,700
Alright, I think this is the same.

3555
02:27:55,860 --> 02:27:57,180
He has to be, like, right here.

3556
02:27:57,260 --> 02:27:57,960
There's no way.

3557
02:28:02,790 --> 02:28:03,230
Alright.

3558
02:28:03,450 --> 02:28:04,370
Nope, he's gone.

3559
02:28:06,010 --> 02:28:07,790
It won't budge!

3560
02:28:08,990 --> 02:28:10,670
Wait, where the fuck do I go?

3561
02:28:10,850 --> 02:28:11,550
The attic?

3562
02:28:17,240 --> 02:28:18,540
Like, where do I go?

3563
02:28:20,080 --> 02:28:20,800
Oh, shit!

3564
02:28:21,000 --> 02:28:22,040
Not there, apparently.

3565
02:28:23,580 --> 02:28:25,160
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

3566
02:28:26,780 --> 02:28:28,100
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

3567
02:28:28,200 --> 02:28:28,300
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

3568
02:28:28,300 --> 02:28:28,320
Cat!

3569
02:28:28,620 --> 02:28:29,460
Do something, Cat!

3570
02:28:30,940 --> 02:28:32,040
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

3571
02:28:32,180 --> 02:28:32,420
Okay.

3572
02:28:33,160 --> 02:28:33,820
That's not fair!

3573
02:28:37,360 --> 02:28:38,000
That's not fair.

3574
02:28:38,200 --> 02:28:39,180
He never looked left.

3575
02:28:42,320 --> 02:28:43,280
I knew it.

3576
02:28:45,380 --> 02:28:46,920
I knew he'd never look left.

3577
02:28:48,540 --> 02:28:49,800
No one ever looks left.

3578
02:28:50,040 --> 02:28:50,380
No!

3579
02:28:50,480 --> 02:28:51,420
Go to your parents' room!

3580
02:28:51,520 --> 02:28:52,100
Go to see mom!

3581
02:28:52,520 --> 02:28:52,920
Yes!

3582
02:28:53,220 --> 02:28:53,620
Mom!

3583
02:28:54,180 --> 02:28:54,580
Yes!

3584
02:28:55,940 --> 02:28:56,880
It worked.

3585
02:28:57,280 --> 02:28:59,040
I told you, they never look left.

3586
02:28:59,500 --> 02:29:00,580
It's always right.

3587
02:29:01,900 --> 02:29:03,880
Springtrap's right-handed, so they always look right.

3588
02:29:05,080 --> 02:29:05,600
Springtrap's right-handed, so they always look right.

3589
02:29:05,600 --> 02:29:05,620
Okay.

3590
02:29:09,580 --> 02:29:10,100
How?

3591
02:29:12,120 --> 02:29:12,640
How?

3592
02:29:12,980 --> 02:29:14,660
What do I do?

3593
02:29:15,640 --> 02:29:16,800
I'm stuck here now.

3594
02:29:17,920 --> 02:29:18,820
What do I...

3595
02:29:22,540 --> 02:29:23,400
What do I do?

3596
02:29:24,620 --> 02:29:25,140
Wait.

3597
02:29:25,440 --> 02:29:25,960
Attic?

3598
02:29:27,200 --> 02:29:27,820
No stairs?

3599
02:29:31,020 --> 02:29:32,020
I need a ladder?

3600
02:29:33,700 --> 02:29:34,060
Oh.

3601
02:29:34,360 --> 02:29:34,720
Haha.

3602
02:29:34,900 --> 02:29:36,740
You didn't see me, loser.

3603
02:29:38,040 --> 02:29:38,400
Hahaha!

3604
02:29:40,060 --> 02:29:41,260
Okay, I gotta go to the attic.

3605
02:29:44,860 --> 02:29:46,000
It's okay, we still have time.

3606
02:29:46,080 --> 02:29:47,340
There's no way he's gonna go this way.

3607
02:29:50,320 --> 02:29:51,060
There's no way.

3608
02:29:52,040 --> 02:29:54,040
There's no way he's a freak if he gets there.

3609
02:29:56,080 --> 02:29:56,560
Okay.

3610
02:29:56,680 --> 02:29:56,920
Okay.

3611
02:29:57,360 --> 02:29:58,880
Are you fucking kidding me?

3612
02:29:59,840 --> 02:30:00,780
No, fuck this.

3613
02:30:03,880 --> 02:30:05,240
What do you mean I can't use that?

3614
02:30:06,320 --> 02:30:07,200
Okay, fuck this.

3615
02:30:07,700 --> 02:30:08,380
Rope time.

3616
02:30:10,740 --> 02:30:11,520
Oh, nice!

3617
02:30:13,200 --> 02:30:13,680
Easy.

3618
02:30:16,120 --> 02:30:16,600
Alright.

3619
02:30:17,680 --> 02:30:18,980
Go to the ball pit.

3620
02:30:19,660 --> 02:30:20,900
Yeah, I'm not dealing.

3621
02:30:20,900 --> 02:30:23,120
I'm gonna, like, use the ladder when it's daytime.

3622
02:30:23,420 --> 02:30:24,980
I'm not fucking picking up the ladder now.

3623
02:30:25,160 --> 02:30:26,580
Like, fuck that.

3624
02:30:29,220 --> 02:30:30,580
To be fair, Oswald...

3625
02:30:30,580 --> 02:30:35,180
To be fair, the animatronic is spending more time with me than my actual dad.

3626
02:30:35,700 --> 02:30:36,920
Wait, what's wrong with this area?

3627
02:30:37,580 --> 02:30:38,660
Weird, where are the doors?

3628
02:30:38,880 --> 02:30:40,320
Yeah, what happened, Jeff?

3629
02:30:41,980 --> 02:30:43,520
You here to pick up pizza?

3630
02:30:44,280 --> 02:30:45,620
No, just hanging out.

3631
02:30:46,420 --> 02:30:46,860
Oh.

3632
02:30:47,040 --> 02:30:49,680
Someone with the name I am a loser I'm a loser.

3633
02:30:49,880 --> 02:30:51,420
I got the place in an order.

3634
02:30:51,600 --> 02:30:53,600
They still haven't picked up their pizza.

3635
02:30:54,420 --> 02:30:56,560
I'm a loser must be new in town.

3636
02:30:57,560 --> 02:30:59,820
Jeff, I don't think that's a real name.

3637
02:31:01,980 --> 02:31:04,540
I'm a loser.

3638
02:31:08,400 --> 02:31:08,960
Damn.

3639
02:31:10,240 --> 02:31:12,020
Stay in school, kid.

3640
02:31:12,580 --> 02:31:14,560
Oh, damn!

3641
02:31:15,640 --> 02:31:19,020
But Jeff, you own a successful pizza place.

3642
02:31:20,200 --> 02:31:21,720
It can't be that bad.

3643
02:31:21,880 --> 02:31:22,080
Look!

3644
02:31:22,900 --> 02:31:23,660
He's here.

3645
02:31:24,500 --> 02:31:26,700
This town used to be really something.

3646
02:31:27,660 --> 02:31:28,740
Look at it now.

3647
02:31:29,100 --> 02:31:30,940
This is literally our only restaurant.

3648
02:31:31,080 --> 02:31:32,080
You can't judge this.

3649
02:31:32,180 --> 02:31:33,800
This is our only fucking restaurant.

3650
02:31:34,760 --> 02:31:36,440
Heck, look at this dump.

3651
02:31:36,940 --> 02:31:39,720
I'll get out of town if I can actually find any work.

3652
02:31:40,920 --> 02:31:44,020
Wouldn't this place be more successful if this is literally our only restaurant?

3653
02:31:44,780 --> 02:31:46,320
Pizza used to be a lot better.

3654
02:31:46,540 --> 02:31:47,720
Back in the old days.

3655
02:31:48,320 --> 02:31:51,920
Though I have to admit, ever since Jeff took over, it got a lot cheaper.

3656
02:31:52,820 --> 02:31:54,600
Quantity over quality, I guess.

3657
02:31:55,860 --> 02:31:56,680
Oh, no.

3658
02:31:57,200 --> 02:31:59,260
I bet you he reheats the pizzas.

3659
02:32:02,460 --> 02:32:05,040
Alright, time to go in my ball pit time machine.

3660
02:32:05,920 --> 02:32:08,320
Back to 1985 I go.

3661
02:32:11,600 --> 02:32:13,680
That thing came from the arcade last time.

3662
02:32:13,840 --> 02:32:15,620
Maybe it's keeping dad there.

3663
02:32:15,880 --> 02:32:16,640
Chip, too.

3664
02:32:17,520 --> 02:32:19,040
Alright, we gotta go to the arcade.

3665
02:32:19,280 --> 02:32:21,020
I have to go all the way to our left side.

3666
02:32:22,140 --> 02:32:22,620
Okay.

3667
02:32:23,700 --> 02:32:26,440
I'm gonna walk, cause I don't trust anybody.

3668
02:32:27,200 --> 02:32:28,180
I'm gonna walk.

3669
02:32:30,660 --> 02:32:31,720
Okay, that was close.

3670
02:32:31,860 --> 02:32:32,760
That was actually close.

3671
02:32:33,120 --> 02:32:35,300
That was pretty close.

3672
02:32:36,980 --> 02:32:39,300
The timing for that was actually crazy.

3673
02:32:39,800 --> 02:32:45,000
Hahahaha Hahahaha Hahahaha Hahahaha

3674
02:32:48,100 --> 02:32:48,120
Arrrr...

3675
02:32:48,120 --> 02:32:49,820
Arrrr...

3676
02:32:49,820 --> 02:32:51,300
Arrrr...

3677
02:32:53,060 --> 02:32:54,660
It's no use!

3678
02:32:56,300 --> 02:32:57,180
Nooooooo!

3679
02:32:57,980 --> 02:33:01,500
I have to go the other wayee!

3680
02:33:04,540 --> 02:33:06,300
Arrrr... Arrrr...

3681
02:33:06,300 --> 02:33:09,020
Arrrr... Arrrr...

3682
02:33:09,020 --> 02:33:11,120
Arrrr... Arrrr...

3683
02:33:11,120 --> 02:33:11,420
Arrrr... Arrrr...

3684
02:33:11,420 --> 02:33:12,260
Arrrr... Arrrr... Arrrr...

3685
02:33:12,260 --> 02:33:13,600
Okay,

3686
02:33:17,520 --> 02:33:18,600
the arcade should be here.

3687
02:33:19,380 --> 02:33:20,260
Please.

3688
02:33:21,760 --> 02:33:24,500
Woah woah woah woah woah woah woah woah woah.

3689
02:33:26,140 --> 02:33:28,200
Wasn't that- was that door vibrating?

3690
02:33:36,080 --> 02:33:37,720
There's no way it looked under.

3691
02:33:38,120 --> 02:33:39,940
That's fucking right little bitch.

3692
02:33:40,760 --> 02:33:42,560
You're not gonna look under here.

3693
02:33:43,120 --> 02:33:44,460
That's fucking right.

3694
02:33:44,680 --> 02:33:45,120
Run!

3695
02:33:48,040 --> 02:33:50,340
Go back to your 7-lemon job.

3696
02:33:51,660 --> 02:33:52,760
Scared horrors.

3697
02:33:53,840 --> 02:33:55,760
Kayo, thank you for the super chat.

3698
02:33:55,860 --> 02:33:56,160
Thank you.

3699
02:33:57,460 --> 02:33:58,200
Oh my god.

3700
02:33:58,400 --> 02:34:03,720
I was like, I don't think doors were supposed to vibrate unless there's a fucking sick rave going on right now.

3701
02:34:05,900 --> 02:34:07,940
I don't think it was a rave.

3702
02:34:08,500 --> 02:34:10,080
Okay, maybe here then?

3703
02:34:11,240 --> 02:34:12,660
Go to the arcade here?

3704
02:34:13,000 --> 02:34:15,120
Wait, how do I go then?

3705
02:34:16,680 --> 02:34:17,160
What?

3706
02:34:19,540 --> 02:34:20,800
The door is shut.

3707
02:34:21,180 --> 02:34:21,920
Wait, what?

3708
02:34:22,900 --> 02:34:24,740
This is literally the only other way!

3709
02:34:25,080 --> 02:34:25,740
The vent?

3710
02:34:26,080 --> 02:34:27,440
Does the vent head over there?

3711
02:34:31,590 --> 02:34:33,910
I thought the vent- there's only two ways in the vent.

3712
02:34:34,130 --> 02:34:35,890
Which is here and the other area.

3713
02:34:36,850 --> 02:34:37,330
Yeah!

3714
02:34:42,780 --> 02:34:43,880
Is there another vent?

3715
02:34:45,520 --> 02:34:47,140
Oh fuck, there's another vent?

3716
02:34:48,300 --> 02:34:51,360
Okay, we gotta figure out where the other vent is.

3717
02:34:51,680 --> 02:34:52,720
Cause I don't remember.

3718
02:34:53,740 --> 02:34:56,120
I don't remember the other vent.

3719
02:34:57,320 --> 02:35:02,880
There was a vent in the- oh my god, I fucking- There was a vent in the entrance.

3720
02:35:04,100 --> 02:35:06,520
Oh, oh, oh, there's no way he saw me, right?

3721
02:35:07,860 --> 02:35:09,760
Or, or, or, or, or...

3722
02:35:09,760 --> 02:35:10,520
No!

3723
02:35:11,780 --> 02:35:12,180
No!

3724
02:35:16,080 --> 02:35:17,580
God fucking damn it.

3725
02:35:17,980 --> 02:35:19,860
God damn- that's good, that's good, it reset.

3726
02:35:20,060 --> 02:35:20,980
I need it to reset.

3727
02:35:21,680 --> 02:35:24,620
I need it to re- I thought I could flash the flashlight!

3728
02:35:26,040 --> 02:35:27,800
I thought I was fast enough!

3729
02:35:28,360 --> 02:35:30,420
Okay, oh wait, I haven't traveled yet.

3730
02:35:30,460 --> 02:35:31,140
Time travel time.

3731
02:35:31,720 --> 02:35:32,120
Okay.

3732
02:35:32,120 --> 02:35:32,280
Okay.

3733
02:35:33,800 --> 02:35:34,800
Alright, here I go.

3734
02:35:35,700 --> 02:35:37,020
Back in it I go.

3735
02:35:38,160 --> 02:35:39,060
God damn it.

3736
02:35:39,960 --> 02:35:42,160
I hate it when he fucking stream snipes me.

3737
02:35:42,740 --> 02:35:43,220
Okay.

3738
02:35:44,300 --> 02:35:47,780
Alright, if I- is- I wonder if it'll be like the same code.

3739
02:35:48,120 --> 02:35:49,980
Where he'll just be at that door.

3740
02:35:51,420 --> 02:35:51,900
No?

3741
02:35:53,420 --> 02:35:56,960
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

3742
02:35:57,440 --> 02:35:58,700
Oh, oh, oh.

3743
02:35:59,680 --> 02:36:00,900
Oh, oh, oh.

3744
02:36:00,900 --> 02:36:05,120
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

3745
02:36:05,120 --> 02:36:07,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

3746
02:36:07,720 --> 02:36:10,200
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

3747
02:36:10,200 --> 02:36:11,160
Oh, where did I hear him?

3748
02:36:14,630 --> 02:36:15,630
Oh, it's vibrating.

3749
02:36:18,170 --> 02:36:19,550
I hear two things.

3750
02:36:20,310 --> 02:36:20,830
Okay.

3751
02:36:22,450 --> 02:36:22,970
Alright.

3752
02:36:25,390 --> 02:36:27,270
Okay, he's just gonna walk away.

3753
02:36:27,750 --> 02:36:29,130
And then we have a vent.

3754
02:36:30,470 --> 02:36:32,850
Scared, scared horror noises.

3755
02:36:34,350 --> 02:36:35,430
Wait, Chica?

3756
02:36:36,370 --> 02:36:37,490
God fucking.

3757
02:36:38,970 --> 02:36:40,410
Fuck am I gonna tell Chica?

3758
02:36:42,030 --> 02:36:42,590
God.

3759
02:36:42,650 --> 02:36:43,150
Okay.

3760
02:36:43,910 --> 02:36:44,870
Okay, I have an idea.

3761
02:36:45,350 --> 02:36:47,730
We turn on the radio and then we run.

3762
02:36:48,970 --> 02:36:49,950
Oh, no.

3763
02:36:50,210 --> 02:36:50,590
No!

3764
02:36:51,790 --> 02:36:53,950
Nani Chica don't go to the right.

3765
02:36:55,830 --> 02:36:56,390
Okay.

3766
02:36:57,630 --> 02:37:00,190
And I hear a spring trap to my right still.

3767
02:37:01,270 --> 02:37:02,990
He's like gurgling right now.

3768
02:37:02,990 --> 02:37:04,210
Oh, God damn it.

3769
02:37:04,230 --> 02:37:04,810
This is not fair.

3770
02:37:06,070 --> 02:37:06,590
Okay.

3771
02:37:08,650 --> 02:37:10,210
Okay, Chica has to come back.

3772
02:37:10,970 --> 02:37:12,430
Chica, you gotta get out.

3773
02:37:12,490 --> 02:37:13,770
There's no pizza there, Chica.

3774
02:37:14,390 --> 02:37:15,450
There's no pizza there.

3775
02:37:16,430 --> 02:37:16,950
Chica.

3776
02:37:17,810 --> 02:37:18,910
I can wait all day.

3777
02:37:19,350 --> 02:37:19,870
Vibrate.

3778
02:37:20,050 --> 02:37:20,750
Vibrate door.

3779
02:37:25,190 --> 02:37:26,370
Oh, my God.

3780
02:37:26,430 --> 02:37:28,050
That is actually so unlucky.

3781
02:37:28,370 --> 02:37:29,510
Oh, my God.

3782
02:37:29,510 --> 02:37:30,810
They're both like...

3783
02:37:30,810 --> 02:37:32,190
Both here.

3784
02:37:33,750 --> 02:37:35,010
Wait, does that mean like...

3785
02:37:35,010 --> 02:37:37,170
The others are gonna come out too?

3786
02:37:38,270 --> 02:37:38,790
Okay.

3787
02:37:41,370 --> 02:37:43,330
No, I hear spring trap to my right.

3788
02:37:45,690 --> 02:37:46,790
Chica, what the fuck?

3789
02:37:46,870 --> 02:37:47,330
Leave!

3790
02:37:48,530 --> 02:37:49,270
Why are you...

3791
02:37:49,270 --> 02:37:51,350
Why are you still there, Chica?

3792
02:37:55,770 --> 02:37:56,970
Where else would she go?

3793
02:37:57,170 --> 02:37:57,870
That's the thing.

3794
02:37:59,390 --> 02:38:00,770
Where else would Chica go?

3795
02:38:01,850 --> 02:38:02,370
Nani?

3796
02:38:02,950 --> 02:38:03,470
Nani?

3797
02:38:03,470 --> 02:38:03,590
Nani?

3798
02:38:04,090 --> 02:38:04,610
Nani?

3799
02:38:06,890 --> 02:38:07,410
Nani?

3800
02:38:07,430 --> 02:38:09,310
No, you fucking can't even...

3801
02:38:17,020 --> 02:38:18,500
He doesn't know.

3802
02:38:18,820 --> 02:38:21,640
He doesn't know.

3803
02:38:22,020 --> 02:38:24,620
He doesn't know, please don't go there.

3804
02:38:24,720 --> 02:38:26,160
No, what the fuck?

3805
02:38:26,180 --> 02:38:27,120
What are you doing?

3806
02:38:27,420 --> 02:38:29,120
Are you fucking kidding me?

3807
02:38:32,840 --> 02:38:33,160
No!

3808
02:38:33,700 --> 02:38:33,740
Please!

3809
02:38:34,060 --> 02:38:34,540
No!

3810
02:38:34,640 --> 02:38:35,320
My God.

3811
02:38:35,720 --> 02:38:37,000
He's gonna say...

3812
02:38:37,000 --> 02:38:38,100
He's gonna say...

3813
02:38:38,100 --> 02:38:39,520
Are you fucking kidding me?

3814
02:38:39,640 --> 02:38:41,400
Why would you close that?

3815
02:38:41,460 --> 02:38:42,080
I don't know.

3816
02:38:42,080 --> 02:38:42,640
Why would you close that?

3817
02:38:44,040 --> 02:38:47,240
Oh my god, I'm gonna be like, how am I that unlucky?

3818
02:38:47,960 --> 02:38:50,780
Oh my god, I'm that unlucky.

3819
02:38:52,520 --> 02:38:57,720
Okay, he didn't go... he didn't go left.

3820
02:39:00,040 --> 02:39:02,020
Oh, he didn't go left.

3821
02:39:04,860 --> 02:39:05,580
Okay.

3822
02:39:05,580 --> 02:39:07,260
Okay, I heard the door.

3823
02:39:07,440 --> 02:39:09,200
I heard the door.

3824
02:39:10,420 --> 02:39:11,920
That's so fucked.

3825
02:39:12,320 --> 02:39:15,340
That's actually so fucked, man.

3826
02:39:16,360 --> 02:39:17,960
Hoor, hoor, hoor, hoor.

3827
02:39:18,280 --> 02:39:19,580
Hoor, hoor.

3828
02:39:19,760 --> 02:39:21,060
Hoor, hoor, hoor.

3829
02:39:21,380 --> 02:39:23,500
Okay, up we go.

3830
02:39:24,540 --> 02:39:25,180
Alright.

3831
02:39:27,240 --> 02:39:28,920
Oh, thank god.

3832
02:39:30,020 --> 02:39:32,200
Okay, then that should be the arcade.

3833
02:39:32,940 --> 02:39:34,040
I'm pretty sure.

3834
02:39:35,480 --> 02:39:38,160
I'm pretty sure that's the arcade right here.

3835
02:39:39,200 --> 02:39:39,920
Oh, there's a photo.

3836
02:39:40,160 --> 02:39:41,000
That's my school picture.

3837
02:39:41,120 --> 02:39:41,520
Wait, what?

3838
02:39:42,280 --> 02:39:43,960
Oh, that's my school picture.

3839
02:39:45,800 --> 02:39:47,480
Are you... how is it still locked?

3840
02:39:47,740 --> 02:39:50,300
How is... how is it still locked?

3841
02:39:50,540 --> 02:39:53,420
Oh my god, please, please.

3842
02:39:55,720 --> 02:39:56,760
Oh yeah.

3843
02:40:09,060 --> 02:40:10,460
How is it still locked?

3844
02:40:10,460 --> 02:40:12,040
How do I get in?

3845
02:40:12,440 --> 02:40:14,060
How do I get in?

3846
02:40:14,560 --> 02:40:15,240
Okay.

3847
02:40:20,300 --> 02:40:21,400
There's no way.

3848
02:40:25,310 --> 02:40:27,030
Is there another vent?

3849
02:40:27,270 --> 02:40:29,510
How many vents are in this fucking place?

3850
02:40:33,290 --> 02:40:33,970
Okay.

3851
02:40:37,650 --> 02:40:38,330
Leave.

3852
02:40:38,330 --> 02:40:39,010
Leave.

3853
02:40:41,290 --> 02:40:42,710
That's where I was!

3854
02:40:45,850 --> 02:40:48,370
I'm so fucking confused.

3855
02:40:48,890 --> 02:40:50,390
Okay, party.

3856
02:40:51,110 --> 02:40:52,770
There's really no way!

3857
02:40:56,480 --> 02:40:57,000
Okay.

3858
02:40:58,360 --> 02:40:59,380
I go there.

3859
02:40:59,660 --> 02:41:00,980
That's the storage.

3860
02:41:01,460 --> 02:41:03,720
How... they blocked everything!

3861
02:41:07,820 --> 02:41:09,260
Is there another vent?

3862
02:41:10,000 --> 02:41:12,680
They... they blocked everything!

3863
02:41:16,340 --> 02:41:16,820
Okay.

3864
02:41:18,580 --> 02:41:20,020
Is he gonna open the door?

3865
02:41:21,040 --> 02:41:21,520
Wait!

3866
02:41:22,540 --> 02:41:23,680
Wait, he opened the door!

3867
02:41:26,680 --> 02:41:27,160
Wait!

3868
02:41:28,420 --> 02:41:29,560
Did he open the door?

3869
02:41:43,780 --> 02:41:44,840
Oh, he has keys.

3870
02:41:44,880 --> 02:41:45,680
That's so fucked.

3871
02:41:45,940 --> 02:41:46,880
That's so fucked.

3872
02:41:47,560 --> 02:41:48,040
That's...

3873
02:41:50,980 --> 02:41:51,720
That's cheating!

3874
02:41:52,600 --> 02:41:54,040
That's fucking cheating!

3875
02:41:57,620 --> 02:41:58,820
What are you doing?

3876
02:41:58,840 --> 02:41:59,360
Leave!

3877
02:41:59,800 --> 02:42:00,540
Leave!

3878
02:42:04,480 --> 02:42:05,640
Chica, please!

3879
02:42:06,160 --> 02:42:07,500
Leave me alone!

3880
02:42:10,500 --> 02:42:11,960
I don't have my key!

3881
02:42:12,120 --> 02:42:12,420
Okay.

3882
02:42:12,580 --> 02:42:14,120
There has to be...

3883
02:42:14,120 --> 02:42:16,200
There's no vent to it!

3884
02:42:19,220 --> 02:42:19,960
Like...

3885
02:42:22,950 --> 02:42:24,770
There's that vent up top!

3886
02:42:24,870 --> 02:42:25,430
What?

3887
02:42:25,870 --> 02:42:27,170
Can I make it?

3888
02:42:28,630 --> 02:42:29,870
Can I make it up there?

3889
02:42:31,170 --> 02:42:31,990
The gifts?

3890
02:42:33,230 --> 02:42:33,990
No, it...

3891
02:42:35,530 --> 02:42:36,830
Oh my God, no!

3892
02:42:37,370 --> 02:42:38,270
I can't!

3893
02:42:38,430 --> 02:42:39,450
It won't let me!

3894
02:42:40,070 --> 02:42:41,330
Okay, then maybe here?

3895
02:42:43,510 --> 02:42:44,630
The door is...

3896
02:42:44,630 --> 02:42:45,930
What isn't locked?

3897
02:42:46,190 --> 02:42:47,490
What the fuck is...

3898
02:42:47,490 --> 02:42:50,830
What the fuck is not locked?

3899
02:42:53,070 --> 02:42:54,310
Oh my God!

3900
02:42:56,990 --> 02:42:58,450
Everything is locked.

3901
02:42:59,890 --> 02:43:01,570
Maybe it's the party room.

3902
02:43:03,450 --> 02:43:04,070
Maybe...

3903
02:43:04,070 --> 02:43:05,010
Maybe you...

3904
02:43:05,010 --> 02:43:06,490
Maybe the party room.

3905
02:43:06,690 --> 02:43:07,390
I know.

3906
02:43:07,610 --> 02:43:08,890
It's the party room.

3907
02:43:09,510 --> 02:43:10,650
It's time to party.

3908
02:43:12,390 --> 02:43:13,550
No, we can't...

3909
02:43:13,550 --> 02:43:14,010
It's locked.

3910
02:43:15,090 --> 02:43:16,650
It's also locked, guys.

3911
02:43:17,660 --> 02:43:18,630
Everything is locked.

3912
02:43:18,830 --> 02:43:20,050
Because fuck me, I guess.

3913
02:43:21,810 --> 02:43:22,880
Are you fucking...

3914
02:43:22,880 --> 02:43:25,000
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

3915
02:43:26,320 --> 02:43:27,160
There's no way.

3916
02:43:27,240 --> 02:43:28,500
Chica is just an alarm.

3917
02:43:29,580 --> 02:43:30,440
There's no way.

3918
02:43:30,540 --> 02:43:31,500
She's just an alarm.

3919
02:43:34,100 --> 02:43:35,260
All right, here we go.

3920
02:43:35,380 --> 02:43:36,360
Bye, Chica.

3921
02:43:38,020 --> 02:43:39,600
Wait, where's Springtrap?

3922
02:43:40,680 --> 02:43:41,620
Oh, there he is.

3923
02:43:41,780 --> 02:43:42,900
What you gonna do?

3924
02:43:43,080 --> 02:43:43,720
Find me?

3925
02:43:49,680 --> 02:43:50,160
Idiot.

3926
02:43:52,540 --> 02:43:53,640
Okay, now that I know.

3927
02:43:53,640 --> 02:43:54,800
Chica is just an alarm.

3928
02:43:55,320 --> 02:43:57,020
Like, she can't do jack shit.

3929
02:43:57,260 --> 02:43:57,980
So I'm safe.

3930
02:43:58,560 --> 02:43:59,040
Okay.

3931
02:43:59,720 --> 02:44:00,380
All right.

3932
02:44:00,520 --> 02:44:01,520
We go to the...

3933
02:44:01,520 --> 02:44:03,100
We go to the party room.

3934
02:44:04,120 --> 02:44:06,340
There has to be something at the party room.

3935
02:44:07,060 --> 02:44:07,660
What are...

3936
02:44:07,660 --> 02:44:09,100
What are they hiding in the party?

3937
02:44:09,420 --> 02:44:10,000
They're hide...

3938
02:44:10,580 --> 02:44:10,820
It's...

3939
02:44:10,820 --> 02:44:12,100
They're hiding a locked room.

3940
02:44:12,380 --> 02:44:15,020
Okay, now that we know that they're hiding a fucking locked room.

3941
02:44:15,160 --> 02:44:16,640
And this one's also locked.

3942
02:44:16,700 --> 02:44:17,200
But that's okay.

3943
02:44:17,420 --> 02:44:17,900
That's...

3944
02:44:22,100 --> 02:44:22,720
That's okay.

3945
02:44:22,720 --> 02:44:23,720
That's okay.

3946
02:44:24,580 --> 02:44:25,200
That's okay.

3947
02:44:25,400 --> 02:44:25,640
That's okay.

3948
02:44:25,640 --> 02:44:25,660
That's okay.

3949
02:44:26,080 --> 02:44:26,640
Everything's fine.

3950
02:44:27,460 --> 02:44:28,620
Everything is locked.

3951
02:44:29,000 --> 02:44:29,400
Wait.

3952
02:44:30,900 --> 02:44:31,640
Oh, shit.

3953
02:44:32,820 --> 02:44:33,220
Yes.

3954
02:44:34,660 --> 02:44:35,420
That's the key.

3955
02:44:40,440 --> 02:44:41,960
There's no way he's in there.

3956
02:44:44,120 --> 02:44:44,860
There's no way.

3957
02:44:44,900 --> 02:44:45,240
I knew it.

3958
02:44:46,060 --> 02:44:47,260
I fucking knew it.

3959
02:44:48,480 --> 02:44:49,200
There's the key.

3960
02:44:49,860 --> 02:44:50,420
Oh, god.

3961
02:44:50,440 --> 02:44:50,840
There it is.

3962
02:44:51,880 --> 02:44:52,520
Oh, my God.

3963
02:44:52,540 --> 02:44:52,860
There it was.

3964
02:44:52,860 --> 02:44:53,300
There it is.

3965
02:44:53,780 --> 02:44:54,180
.

3966
02:44:54,180 --> 02:44:55,220
I can play some videos.

3967
02:44:55,220 --> 02:44:55,760
We're playing video games now.

3968
02:45:00,610 --> 02:45:01,630
Shop the puzzle!

3969
02:45:01,910 --> 02:45:02,870
Ooh, okay.

3970
02:45:03,370 --> 02:45:04,790
How do I do this?

3971
02:45:05,010 --> 02:45:05,310
Okay.

3972
02:45:06,370 --> 02:45:06,850
Alright.

3973
02:45:06,950 --> 02:45:07,910
I mean, this is...

3974
02:45:07,910 --> 02:45:09,330
This should be easy, right?

3975
02:45:11,070 --> 02:45:12,030
Okay, this...

3976
02:45:13,050 --> 02:45:13,530
This...

3977
02:45:13,530 --> 02:45:14,310
This...

3978
02:45:15,550 --> 02:45:16,030
Okay.

3979
02:45:17,330 --> 02:45:18,510
Sir, am I timed?

3980
02:45:18,730 --> 02:45:19,690
Okay, no, okay.

3981
02:45:19,910 --> 02:45:21,790
Do I win anything for solving it?

3982
02:45:24,210 --> 02:45:26,950
Do I win anything, guys, if I solve this puzzle?

3983
02:45:28,090 --> 02:45:37,030
Okay, but, like, what if I do this, and then I put this here, and then I just need to put him here.

3984
02:45:37,890 --> 02:45:38,850
Oh, no.

3985
02:45:40,010 --> 02:45:41,850
What do I get with tickets?

3986
02:45:42,730 --> 02:45:44,290
Chat, what do I get with tickets?

3987
02:45:45,410 --> 02:46:01,770
Okay, but what if I put this here, and then put this here, and then this here, and then and then this here, and then, um...

3988
02:46:01,770 --> 02:46:03,010
Do I get anything?

3989
02:46:03,150 --> 02:46:04,510
What kind of prizes do I get?

3990
02:46:05,970 --> 02:46:06,370
Chat.

3991
02:46:08,170 --> 02:46:08,570
Satisfaction?

3992
02:46:08,610 --> 02:46:10,370
Okay, but what kind of prizes do I get?

3993
02:46:13,010 --> 02:46:14,950
No, no, no, I'm not going in circles.

3994
02:46:15,010 --> 02:46:16,010
I know what I'm doing.

3995
02:46:18,710 --> 02:46:20,210
Guys, I know what I'm doing.

3996
02:46:20,370 --> 02:46:21,030
It works.

3997
02:46:21,090 --> 02:46:21,890
Guys, trust, trust, trust.

3998
02:46:24,270 --> 02:46:24,670
See?

3999
02:46:26,070 --> 02:46:30,030
And then I do this, and then I do...

4000
02:46:37,370 --> 02:46:38,410
What is this?

4001
02:46:39,490 --> 02:46:42,350
What the fuck is this part of the body?

4002
02:46:42,870 --> 02:46:43,790
Is it this?

4003
02:46:44,850 --> 02:46:45,990
Oh, I did it!

4004
02:46:46,190 --> 02:46:46,690
Yeah!

4005
02:46:49,270 --> 02:46:50,610
I told you!

4006
02:46:50,710 --> 02:46:51,710
Trust the process!

4007
02:46:53,690 --> 02:46:54,290
Nice.

4008
02:46:54,290 --> 02:46:55,750
Okay, I'm not screenshotting.

4009
02:46:56,070 --> 02:46:57,110
New music!

4010
02:46:57,270 --> 02:46:58,090
Oh, okay.

4011
02:46:59,010 --> 02:47:00,130
Looks like I got some tickets!

4012
02:47:01,230 --> 02:47:02,630
Okay, we don't need tickets, actually.

4013
02:47:04,170 --> 02:47:05,310
What the fuck?

4014
02:47:05,610 --> 02:47:06,010
Hello?

4015
02:47:06,690 --> 02:47:07,090
Bonnie?

4016
02:47:08,410 --> 02:47:09,130
Hello, Bonnie.

4017
02:47:09,490 --> 02:47:10,730
Are you a good guy?

4018
02:47:11,530 --> 02:47:13,610
Guys, I don't think... I don't think that's a good guy.

4019
02:47:16,510 --> 02:47:19,470
Maybe if I know more about that thing, I can somehow lure it away.

4020
02:47:20,030 --> 02:47:22,230
Okay, guys, we gotta get in here and read.

4021
02:47:22,550 --> 02:47:23,550
We gotta start reading.

4022
02:47:23,610 --> 02:47:24,310
We're not like Dylan.

4023
02:47:24,430 --> 02:47:25,290
We know how to read.

4024
02:47:25,850 --> 02:47:28,290
Why do I just get... I did it!

4025
02:47:30,550 --> 02:47:31,110
Okay.

4026
02:47:32,070 --> 02:47:33,530
Um... Hey, that's me!

4027
02:47:34,810 --> 02:47:36,070
Okay, where's the...

4028
02:47:36,070 --> 02:47:36,950
Where's the sketchbook?

4029
02:47:37,110 --> 02:47:37,850
Okay, there it is.

4030
02:47:38,270 --> 02:47:39,630
What... What was it?

4031
02:47:41,310 --> 02:47:42,150
Where's Bonnie?

4032
02:47:43,610 --> 02:47:44,170
Wait.

4033
02:47:44,430 --> 02:47:47,290
Did they... Did he never sketch anything about Bonnie?

4034
02:47:48,330 --> 02:47:50,470
It's just Freddy, Chica... Oh, there it is.

4035
02:47:50,530 --> 02:47:50,770
Bonnie.

4036
02:47:52,790 --> 02:47:54,590
Adjust... Do not attempt to play.

4037
02:47:54,710 --> 02:47:57,230
Any voice malfunction must be reported.

4038
02:47:57,530 --> 02:47:57,950
Oh!

4039
02:47:58,290 --> 02:47:59,710
Okay, we just gotta play the guitar.

4040
02:48:02,930 --> 02:48:04,350
Um... Breaks at least one soap.

4041
02:48:04,370 --> 02:48:04,810
Change them.

4042
02:48:04,870 --> 02:48:11,050
Upper manager requested all strings to be dumped off-site due to... Tech 2 was asked to dump them at the mill.

4043
02:48:11,290 --> 02:48:11,750
Oh!

4044
02:48:11,870 --> 02:48:13,850
Okay, we just gotta find the string.

4045
02:48:15,310 --> 02:48:15,790
Okay.

4046
02:48:16,490 --> 02:48:17,290
I'll get it.

4047
02:48:18,350 --> 02:48:19,270
We gotta get the guitar.

4048
02:48:21,030 --> 02:48:21,510
Okay.

4049
02:48:21,730 --> 02:48:23,110
I know how to do this.

4050
02:48:23,890 --> 02:48:25,130
I figured it out.

4051
02:48:26,430 --> 02:48:26,910
Boom.

4052
02:48:28,490 --> 02:48:29,690
And then...

4053
02:48:30,490 --> 02:48:36,250
And I just gotta... I just gotta fix... I just gotta bring future guitar strings to...

4054
02:48:36,250 --> 02:48:39,250
Uh... Present guitar strings to past guitar.

4055
02:48:39,630 --> 02:48:43,790
And then... And then Canada will become America's state.

4056
02:48:43,970 --> 02:48:44,830
After I bring it...

4057
02:48:48,110 --> 02:48:49,290
Canada become...

4058
02:48:50,190 --> 02:48:53,590
Alaska... We might have lost Alaska, but we gained Canada.

4059
02:48:54,470 --> 02:48:55,190
The fuck?

4060
02:48:55,510 --> 02:48:56,190
Oh, shit.

4061
02:48:56,190 --> 02:48:56,770
I think I'm dead.

4062
02:48:58,310 --> 02:48:58,710
Whoa!

4063
02:49:01,670 --> 02:49:02,230
It's okay.

4064
02:49:02,390 --> 02:49:03,750
There's no way I'll trip, right?

4065
02:49:08,070 --> 02:49:09,090
That's fucking right.

4066
02:49:09,250 --> 02:49:10,150
Goodbye, bitch.

4067
02:49:11,150 --> 02:49:11,550
Alright.

4068
02:49:14,870 --> 02:49:17,990
Okay, I need to go to the mill and see if I can... If there's... Wait.

4069
02:49:18,090 --> 02:49:19,290
Did I already got strings?

4070
02:49:20,730 --> 02:49:23,790
I just... I keep dumpster diving, so I can't tell.

4071
02:49:25,030 --> 02:49:25,430
Alright.

4072
02:49:25,530 --> 02:49:26,450
I don't think so.

4073
02:49:26,870 --> 02:49:30,390
Okay, I'm gonna see if the mill... If I can, like, activate it now.

4074
02:49:30,670 --> 02:49:31,870
If I can go to the mill.

4075
02:49:33,210 --> 02:49:33,730
Alright.

4076
02:49:33,930 --> 02:49:36,110
I've seen the prices in Canada.

4077
02:49:36,450 --> 02:49:38,350
It's cause we have paper money!

4078
02:49:38,670 --> 02:49:39,190
Okay?

4079
02:49:39,570 --> 02:49:44,270
The only way to solve this is if we can use American currency.

4080
02:49:47,590 --> 02:49:49,050
1985 mill?

4081
02:49:49,150 --> 02:49:50,490
Am I allowed to go out?

4082
02:49:50,770 --> 02:49:51,290
Like...

4083
02:49:52,750 --> 02:49:56,170
I don't even know if I'm allowed to go out in, like, uh...

4084
02:49:56,190 --> 02:49:56,890
1985!

4085
02:49:58,170 --> 02:49:58,690
Okay.

4086
02:50:02,440 --> 02:50:02,960
Alright.

4087
02:50:03,060 --> 02:50:03,540
Let's see.

4088
02:50:05,120 --> 02:50:06,200
You keep losing.

4089
02:50:06,440 --> 02:50:09,060
Try not to get... Oh, thank you for the amazing tip.

4090
02:50:09,660 --> 02:50:10,360
Oh, man.

4091
02:50:10,440 --> 02:50:11,760
I wish I knew that, too.

4092
02:50:12,900 --> 02:50:13,420
Wait.

4093
02:50:13,540 --> 02:50:13,780
No.

4094
02:50:13,860 --> 02:50:15,040
There's nothing in the garbage.

4095
02:50:16,200 --> 02:50:16,720
Yuck.

4096
02:50:16,720 --> 02:50:19,580
Pretty certain this trash has been sitting here since the mill.

4097
02:50:20,140 --> 02:50:20,660
Wait.

4098
02:50:20,700 --> 02:50:22,300
Can I actually go out now?

4099
02:50:24,460 --> 02:50:25,840
Is that actually possible?

4100
02:50:26,240 --> 02:50:26,600
Is that actually possible?

4101
02:50:27,940 --> 02:50:28,020
Alright.

4102
02:50:28,020 --> 02:50:28,500
Let's find out.

4103
02:50:33,070 --> 02:50:34,170
You keep losing.

4104
02:50:34,330 --> 02:50:35,490
Try sucking less.

4105
02:50:36,770 --> 02:50:37,770
Thank you, game.

4106
02:50:37,930 --> 02:50:39,510
I really appreciate that.

4107
02:50:40,810 --> 02:50:41,750
I don't understand.

4108
02:50:42,850 --> 02:50:44,070
Can I actually go...

4109
02:50:44,070 --> 02:50:44,510
Okay.

4110
02:50:45,350 --> 02:50:48,030
I'm gonna try touching the guitar and see if that works.

4111
02:50:49,030 --> 02:50:49,510
Okay.

4112
02:50:49,530 --> 02:50:52,290
I'm gonna touch the guitar and then, like...

4113
02:50:52,290 --> 02:50:52,950
Oh, no.

4114
02:50:53,010 --> 02:50:53,630
I don't wanna go there.

4115
02:50:54,850 --> 02:50:56,570
Yeah, but, like, where's the...

4116
02:50:56,570 --> 02:50:58,230
There was no string at the mill.

4117
02:50:59,150 --> 02:51:00,250
Did I actually...

4118
02:51:01,810 --> 02:51:04,070
Did I actually, like, not...

4119
02:51:04,070 --> 02:51:05,690
Was that actually a string?

4120
02:51:06,210 --> 02:51:07,490
Dude, nothing showed up.

4121
02:51:08,710 --> 02:51:09,170
Wait.

4122
02:51:09,230 --> 02:51:10,410
Nothing showed up on...

4123
02:51:10,410 --> 02:51:11,150
Nothing highlighted.

4124
02:51:12,170 --> 02:51:12,630
Okay.

4125
02:51:12,690 --> 02:51:13,670
Let me try again.

4126
02:51:15,270 --> 02:51:16,750
Nothing highlighted at all.

4127
02:51:16,830 --> 02:51:17,850
So, like, I couldn't tell.

4128
02:51:18,550 --> 02:51:19,010
Alright.

4129
02:51:19,870 --> 02:51:20,670
Let's try again.

4130
02:51:22,290 --> 02:51:22,750
Alright.

4131
02:51:22,830 --> 02:51:23,250
Let's try.

4132
02:51:24,530 --> 02:51:25,330
Are you sure?

4133
02:51:26,430 --> 02:51:26,890
No.

4134
02:51:26,970 --> 02:51:27,790
I can't get one guide.

4135
02:51:27,870 --> 02:51:28,690
It was, like, three guides.

4136
02:51:31,550 --> 02:51:33,150
At best, it was three guides.

4137
02:51:35,850 --> 02:51:36,310
Okay.

4138
02:51:37,370 --> 02:51:38,410
Maybe I have to...

4139
02:51:38,410 --> 02:51:38,710
Yeah.

4140
02:51:38,770 --> 02:51:39,810
Maybe I have to touch the guitar.

4141
02:51:40,130 --> 02:51:40,470
No!

4142
02:51:40,570 --> 02:51:41,770
I don't want to fucking leave!

4143
02:51:42,470 --> 02:51:42,930
Okay.

4144
02:51:44,990 --> 02:51:45,450
Yeah.

4145
02:51:45,570 --> 02:51:46,350
Is that the string?

4146
02:51:46,650 --> 02:51:47,590
I can't... Yeah.

4147
02:51:47,650 --> 02:51:48,410
I can't touch it.

4148
02:51:49,570 --> 02:51:50,910
It won't let me touch it.

4149
02:51:53,770 --> 02:51:54,230
Alright.

4150
02:51:54,390 --> 02:51:55,830
I think I have to touch the guitar.

4151
02:51:56,370 --> 02:51:58,130
And it'll let me activate it.

4152
02:52:01,470 --> 02:52:03,970
This is the longest third night of my life.

4153
02:52:04,450 --> 02:52:07,270
Also, wouldn't mom think it's weird that I'm not in my room?

4154
02:52:07,630 --> 02:52:11,530
Like, don't parents be, like, check up on you to be like, Alright, sweetie.

4155
02:52:11,670 --> 02:52:12,010
Goodnight.

4156
02:52:12,170 --> 02:52:13,210
Here's a goodnight kiss.

4157
02:52:14,270 --> 02:52:15,890
And she'll be like, Where's my son?

4158
02:52:16,930 --> 02:52:18,970
And also, why is the windows boarded up?

4159
02:52:19,150 --> 02:52:20,390
Does she not check my room?

4160
02:52:21,170 --> 02:52:24,610
Does she not check, like, how I'm doing?

4161
02:52:27,310 --> 02:52:28,710
Oh, yeah, she's at work.

4162
02:52:28,770 --> 02:52:32,510
Yeah, but when she comes back home from work, she'd be like, where the fuck is my son?

4163
02:52:33,610 --> 02:52:34,590
Hot tub time machine.

4164
02:52:38,590 --> 02:52:38,990
Okay.

4165
02:52:40,090 --> 02:52:41,090
Alright, here we go.

4166
02:52:42,510 --> 02:52:43,630
Okay, I touched it.

4167
02:52:43,750 --> 02:52:44,330
Oh, wait!

4168
02:52:44,370 --> 02:52:45,170
There's no guitar here!

4169
02:52:47,430 --> 02:52:48,630
Wait, where did the guitar go?

4170
02:52:50,910 --> 02:52:51,710
Oh, shit!

4171
02:52:51,770 --> 02:52:52,310
There it is!

4172
02:52:55,810 --> 02:52:56,210
Someone...

4173
02:52:56,370 --> 02:52:56,850
Okay, it's time!

4174
02:52:58,290 --> 02:52:59,370
I figured it out!

4175
02:53:00,030 --> 02:53:00,510
Alright.

4176
02:53:01,470 --> 02:53:02,530
Okay, and then we go...

4177
02:53:02,530 --> 02:53:03,290
Now we go back!

4178
02:53:06,170 --> 02:53:07,770
Time to go back to the...

4179
02:53:09,170 --> 02:53:10,530
Time to go back in there.

4180
02:53:11,410 --> 02:53:11,890
Alright.

4181
02:53:11,950 --> 02:53:14,050
Then we go to the mill.

4182
02:53:14,330 --> 02:53:15,390
We don't need coins.

4183
02:53:15,570 --> 02:53:16,410
We don't need prizes.

4184
02:53:16,850 --> 02:53:17,330
Guys.

4185
02:53:17,650 --> 02:53:21,390
We figured out that the prizes are literally just music and lock.

4186
02:53:21,610 --> 02:53:23,810
Like, am I really gonna listen to the fucking music?

4187
02:53:24,270 --> 02:53:24,750
Like...

4188
02:53:30,050 --> 02:53:30,810
Let's go back.

4189
02:53:31,270 --> 02:53:31,670
Let's go back.

4190
02:53:32,230 --> 02:53:32,630
Let's go back.

4191
02:53:32,630 --> 02:53:34,410
I actually really am enjoying this game so far.

4192
02:53:35,110 --> 02:53:36,790
It's, like, different from what I usually play.

4193
02:53:36,990 --> 02:53:37,870
But I really...

4194
02:53:37,870 --> 02:53:39,730
I think it... I now understand what people say.

4195
02:53:39,950 --> 02:53:41,730
This has been one of the better FNAF games.

4196
02:53:47,380 --> 02:53:47,780
Alright.

4197
02:53:47,960 --> 02:53:48,460
Here we go.

4198
02:53:48,560 --> 02:53:49,740
I have no idea what's going on with the lore.

4199
02:53:49,960 --> 02:53:51,960
Just that, like, where the fuck is going on with Dad.

4200
02:53:52,260 --> 02:53:52,960
Okay, there we go.

4201
02:53:53,780 --> 02:53:54,720
Alright, stream time.

4202
02:53:55,680 --> 02:53:56,080
Oh!

4203
02:53:56,400 --> 02:53:56,800
Oh!

4204
02:53:56,800 --> 02:53:58,360
Where the fuck is he?

4205
02:53:58,660 --> 02:54:00,220
Oh no, now he's doing No I'm Poor.

4206
02:54:00,580 --> 02:54:05,220
Who knew Oswald... Oswald the Oswald was also Oswald the Vacoon.

4207
02:54:05,460 --> 02:54:06,760
This will definitely...

4208
02:54:06,760 --> 02:54:07,800
They already know I'm poor!

4209
02:54:09,440 --> 02:54:11,020
You're poor too, Dylan!

4210
02:54:11,260 --> 02:54:14,640
You go to the same public school as I do!

4211
02:54:19,080 --> 02:54:20,360
Joke's on you, Dylan!

4212
02:54:20,600 --> 02:54:22,380
We're all poor here!

4213
02:54:31,780 --> 02:54:33,660
Dylan, why are you here?

4214
02:54:33,720 --> 02:54:33,960
Dylan, why are you here?

4215
02:54:33,960 --> 02:54:34,960
Yeah, what's he doing here?

4216
02:54:35,100 --> 02:54:37,020
Yeah, what's he doing here?

4217
02:54:37,080 --> 02:54:37,280
Dylan!

4218
02:54:40,060 --> 02:54:41,960
I can't worry about him right now.

4219
02:54:42,060 --> 02:54:42,760
I need to get back.

4220
02:54:44,920 --> 02:54:46,420
Yeah, he was here too!

4221
02:54:46,880 --> 02:54:48,780
He is also as poor as me!

4222
02:54:49,480 --> 02:54:49,820
He is also as poor as me!

4223
02:54:51,160 --> 02:54:56,040
It was an indie game and Scott was like, wait, this is better than all my other FNAF games.

4224
02:54:56,160 --> 02:54:56,960
I'm gonna buy them.

4225
02:54:57,960 --> 02:54:59,880
And now it's not an indie game.

4226
02:55:00,220 --> 02:55:01,640
Because Scott bought them.

4227
02:55:03,660 --> 02:55:04,720
Alright, here we go.

4228
02:55:08,130 --> 02:55:08,930
Let's see.

4229
02:55:09,470 --> 02:55:10,950
I gotta fix the guitar.

4230
02:55:11,350 --> 02:55:13,450
And then play it.

4231
02:55:13,550 --> 02:55:15,470
And then after playing it, we gotta...

4232
02:55:15,470 --> 02:55:18,450
Okay, we gotta go back to the fucking arcade.

4233
02:55:19,030 --> 02:55:20,330
And free Chip.

4234
02:55:21,730 --> 02:55:23,350
Alright, hot tub time machine.

4235
02:55:23,430 --> 02:55:23,890
Let's go!

4236
02:55:25,730 --> 02:55:27,290
What if I just bring another...

4237
02:55:27,290 --> 02:55:30,230
What if I just bring Jeff with me?

4238
02:55:31,210 --> 02:55:32,450
I'll be like, Jeff, jump in!

4239
02:55:32,570 --> 02:55:33,310
Jump in, Jeff!

4240
02:55:35,830 --> 02:55:36,910
Why don't I just do that?

4241
02:55:40,690 --> 02:55:41,270
Yeah, alright.

4242
02:55:43,290 --> 02:55:43,690
Alright.

4243
02:55:45,950 --> 02:55:46,350
Okay.

4244
02:55:46,350 --> 02:55:46,990
Plug it in!

4245
02:55:48,330 --> 02:55:49,110
Okay, freaks.

4246
02:55:49,110 --> 02:55:49,750
Let's jam!

4247
02:55:56,570 --> 02:55:56,970
Alright.

4248
02:56:00,010 --> 02:56:01,730
Uh-oh, I need to get out of here!

4249
02:56:03,170 --> 02:56:04,350
Oh, this way?

4250
02:56:06,110 --> 02:56:07,630
He's like, who touched my guitar?

4251
02:56:08,150 --> 02:56:09,110
Who touched it?

4252
02:56:11,110 --> 02:56:12,970
Who the fuck touched my guitar?

4253
02:56:13,610 --> 02:56:13,750
Who the fuck touched my guitar?

4254
02:56:14,890 --> 02:56:15,690
Oh, hey, Freddy.

4255
02:56:16,410 --> 02:56:17,850
Oh, I can get through here now!

4256
02:56:20,150 --> 02:56:21,770
Nobody touches my guitar.

4257
02:56:23,470 --> 02:56:24,350
Nobody touches my guitar.

4258
02:56:25,070 --> 02:56:26,510
Bro, I fixed your guitar.

4259
02:56:28,690 --> 02:56:29,790
Oh, oh, oh!

4260
02:56:30,030 --> 02:56:30,970
Oh, oh, oh!

4261
02:56:30,970 --> 02:56:33,910
Oh, oh, oh!

4262
02:56:33,910 --> 02:56:34,930
How to follow the vents!

4263
02:56:38,610 --> 02:56:40,070
Cool animatronic monster!

4264
02:56:40,810 --> 02:56:42,630
Anyway, here's Wonderwall!

4265
02:56:43,110 --> 02:56:44,990
Thank you for the super chat!

4266
02:56:45,090 --> 02:56:45,570
Thank you!

4267
02:56:47,130 --> 02:56:48,130
Holy shit!

4268
02:56:48,770 --> 02:56:49,890
Okay, that was scary.

4269
02:56:50,370 --> 02:56:51,570
That was actually scary.

4270
02:56:54,090 --> 02:56:55,450
Okay, it's this way.

4271
02:56:55,450 --> 02:56:57,450
And then...

4272
02:56:58,950 --> 02:56:59,690
There you are!

4273
02:57:00,730 --> 02:57:02,750
Oh, oh no, he has brain damage.

4274
02:57:02,870 --> 02:57:03,370
There's no way.

4275
02:57:03,870 --> 02:57:04,830
That's a strong mallet.

4276
02:57:05,870 --> 02:57:06,610
Are you okay?

4277
02:57:06,850 --> 02:57:08,030
What's 2 plus 2, Chip?

4278
02:57:08,690 --> 02:57:09,170
Thanks.

4279
02:57:09,370 --> 02:57:11,490
I don't know what that...

4280
02:57:12,030 --> 02:57:12,830
Thank me later.

4281
02:57:13,310 --> 02:57:14,410
Was there a grown-up with you?

4282
02:57:15,470 --> 02:57:16,670
No, have you...

4283
02:57:16,670 --> 02:57:18,910
Oh yeah, Mike left you to die!

4284
02:57:19,350 --> 02:57:21,650
By the way, you guys have been friends for like...

4285
02:57:21,650 --> 02:57:22,750
six years!

4286
02:57:23,310 --> 02:57:24,450
Mike left you to...

4287
02:57:24,450 --> 02:57:25,210
fucking die!

4288
02:57:27,670 --> 02:57:28,750
I found him.

4289
02:57:28,830 --> 02:57:29,750
He's safe now.

4290
02:57:30,190 --> 02:57:32,550
And you met me for 15 minutes.

4291
02:57:33,010 --> 02:57:34,310
I saved your ass.

4292
02:57:35,550 --> 02:57:36,750
You're gonna be an adult...

4293
02:57:36,750 --> 02:57:37,810
when I go back to the present.

4294
02:57:37,990 --> 02:57:38,650
Remember me.

4295
02:57:42,430 --> 02:57:43,630
Come on, man.

4296
02:57:43,730 --> 02:57:44,330
We gotta split!

4297
02:57:44,990 --> 02:57:46,030
No, I...

4298
02:57:46,690 --> 02:57:47,590
Where am I going?

4299
02:57:48,250 --> 02:57:49,230
Oh shit, Freddy!

4300
02:57:50,310 --> 02:57:52,250
Freddy and Bonnie at once?

4301
02:57:52,750 --> 02:57:53,330
Hey, Freddy!

4302
02:57:53,550 --> 02:57:54,110
Bye, Freddy!

4303
02:57:59,490 --> 02:58:00,990
Right here, I'll go.

4304
02:58:04,550 --> 02:58:05,870
Oh, I can't sneak out.

4305
02:58:10,850 --> 02:58:11,750
Okay, spiders.

4306
02:58:13,070 --> 02:58:14,270
That's good, that's good.

4307
02:58:14,310 --> 02:58:15,810
Spiders are not as...

4308
02:58:15,810 --> 02:58:16,650
not bad.

4309
02:58:17,070 --> 02:58:18,250
Spiders are pretty easy.

4310
02:58:18,550 --> 02:58:19,970
It's just typing up the dead.

4311
02:58:21,290 --> 02:58:22,550
It's a type racer.

4312
02:58:25,750 --> 02:58:25,950
Goodbye!

4313
02:58:27,850 --> 02:58:29,410
Oh, I can literally just leave.

4314
02:58:30,390 --> 02:58:31,070
Alright.

4315
02:58:32,210 --> 02:58:33,430
Guess I'll just go here.

4316
02:58:38,490 --> 02:58:41,990
I like how Freddy's just stands there menacingly.

4317
02:58:42,170 --> 02:58:42,850
Like...

4318
02:58:43,770 --> 02:58:45,210
He doesn't do shit!

4319
02:58:45,630 --> 02:58:47,130
He's just like, hey guys!

4320
02:58:49,290 --> 02:58:50,270
Hey guys!

4321
02:58:50,610 --> 02:58:53,470
I heard everybody is having a good time!

4322
02:58:54,010 --> 02:58:54,410
Ah!

4323
02:58:57,490 --> 02:58:59,590
I'm not having a good time!

4324
02:58:59,970 --> 02:59:01,750
I'm not having a good time!

4325
02:59:02,290 --> 02:59:03,330
I'm not having a good time!

4326
02:59:05,510 --> 02:59:06,610
Wait, what?

4327
02:59:07,390 --> 02:59:09,770
Whoa, what the fuck was that?

4328
02:59:16,570 --> 02:59:20,630
In fact, she was not having a good time.

4329
02:59:21,890 --> 02:59:23,710
I know I heard his voice.

4330
02:59:24,450 --> 02:59:25,830
Hang in there, Dad.

4331
02:59:29,050 --> 02:59:30,130
Hang in there, Dad.

4332
02:59:30,850 --> 02:59:32,430
Until you touch my guitar.

4333
02:59:32,530 --> 02:59:33,470
Until you touch my guitar.

4334
02:59:34,670 --> 02:59:35,970
Until you touch my guitar.

4335
02:59:36,650 --> 02:59:37,870
Oh shit, you're right!

4336
02:59:38,070 --> 02:59:40,350
Maybe I had a higher budget!

4337
02:59:41,150 --> 02:59:43,330
Maybe 911 will work in the past!

4338
02:59:43,430 --> 02:59:43,570
Maybe 911 will work in the past!

4339
02:59:43,570 --> 02:59:43,890
You're right!

4340
02:59:44,550 --> 02:59:45,050
Oh my god.

4341
02:59:46,350 --> 02:59:49,290
After school, no idea how I'll make it through that day.

4342
02:59:49,290 --> 02:59:50,470
I barely slept.

4343
02:59:51,330 --> 02:59:52,090
Alright.

4344
02:59:52,790 --> 02:59:54,370
Oh, I should pet the cat!

4345
02:59:55,610 --> 02:59:58,950
I knew that she was not having a good day.

4346
02:59:59,970 --> 03:00:00,730
Hello!

4347
03:00:03,870 --> 03:00:06,790
Plus five for petting cat.

4348
03:00:07,770 --> 03:00:08,530
Mom?

4349
03:00:08,990 --> 03:00:09,430
Mom?

4350
03:00:11,090 --> 03:00:11,590
Where's mom?

4351
03:00:13,030 --> 03:00:14,410
Wouldn't mom make me lunch?

4352
03:00:15,470 --> 03:00:16,230
Mom?

4353
03:00:17,550 --> 03:00:18,530
Where's mom?

4354
03:00:18,630 --> 03:00:19,270
Oh shit!

4355
03:00:19,290 --> 03:00:19,450
Wait!

4356
03:00:21,130 --> 03:00:22,470
Wait, I'm gonna check the attic.

4357
03:00:23,110 --> 03:00:23,470
No!

4358
03:00:24,290 --> 03:00:25,010
Attic!

4359
03:00:29,030 --> 03:00:29,750
No!

4360
03:00:38,530 --> 03:00:40,850
I could've moved the ladder.

4361
03:00:43,450 --> 03:00:44,170
No!

4362
03:00:45,070 --> 03:00:46,590
Okay, time for school.

4363
03:00:46,810 --> 03:00:48,590
God damn it, fucking education time!

4364
03:00:52,100 --> 03:00:53,720
God damn it!

4365
03:00:53,840 --> 03:00:55,440
It's education time!

4366
03:01:00,900 --> 03:01:01,660
Alright.

4367
03:01:02,600 --> 03:01:03,360
Hello?

4368
03:01:04,060 --> 03:01:05,640
Is anybody here?

4369
03:01:06,260 --> 03:01:07,340
Hello, kids?

4370
03:01:08,580 --> 03:01:11,260
Oh, nobody wants to talk to me?

4371
03:01:11,920 --> 03:01:14,220
It's okay, I have zero friends apparently.

4372
03:01:15,160 --> 03:01:15,920
Hello?

4373
03:01:15,920 --> 03:01:16,480
Hey Dylan!

4374
03:01:22,830 --> 03:01:25,790
Hey look, it's Oswald the raccoon.

4375
03:01:26,750 --> 03:01:29,070
I'm surprised he's still not out.

4376
03:01:29,230 --> 03:01:30,630
We're all poor!

4377
03:01:30,810 --> 03:01:31,870
Where are you fuckers?

4378
03:01:33,010 --> 03:01:36,350
Yeah, he probably smells right at home there.

4379
03:01:40,350 --> 03:01:40,910
Whoa!

4380
03:01:44,050 --> 03:01:46,810
They look like they're funking it right now.

4381
03:01:46,910 --> 03:01:49,230
Oh no, I definitely did not take my meds.

4382
03:01:49,310 --> 03:01:50,930
Oh, look at Freddy go!

4383
03:01:51,070 --> 03:01:52,470
Oh my god, he's doing the robot!

4384
03:01:53,750 --> 03:02:02,910
Okay, wait, Bonnie's humping the Okay, not gonna lie, like, they got some moves.

4385
03:02:02,990 --> 03:02:05,330
Bro, okay, Freddy's got some moves.

4386
03:02:05,450 --> 03:02:06,450
Like, look at him go!

4387
03:02:06,930 --> 03:02:08,390
Like, get it, Freddy!

4388
03:02:08,810 --> 03:02:10,170
Bonnie is...

4389
03:02:10,170 --> 03:02:11,210
Bonnie!

4390
03:02:11,590 --> 03:02:12,810
This is a peak...

4391
03:02:12,810 --> 03:02:14,690
This is an elementary school, Bonnie.

4392
03:02:14,950 --> 03:02:15,730
This is...

4393
03:02:16,610 --> 03:02:17,710
Damn me.

4394
03:02:18,170 --> 03:02:20,650
This is the Olympic breakdancing.

4395
03:02:23,230 --> 03:02:25,590
Maybe all that trash has made him sick.

4396
03:02:26,330 --> 03:02:28,610
Maybe he's finally losing it.

4397
03:02:28,610 --> 03:02:30,470
Ha ha ha ha!

4398
03:02:30,690 --> 03:02:31,930
Ha ha ha ha!

4399
03:02:32,010 --> 03:02:32,930
Ho ho ho!

4400
03:02:32,990 --> 03:02:34,070
Ho ho ho ho!

4401
03:02:35,670 --> 03:02:37,190
Ho ho ho ho!

4402
03:02:37,490 --> 03:02:38,850
Ho ho ho ho!

4403
03:02:39,770 --> 03:02:40,890
Oh shit!

4404
03:02:41,150 --> 03:02:41,990
Oh no!

4405
03:02:43,070 --> 03:02:44,570
I gotta get outta here!

4406
03:02:46,690 --> 03:02:49,410
Oh god, I gotta go to the pop-it!

4407
03:02:49,550 --> 03:02:50,050
Okay!

4408
03:02:50,450 --> 03:02:51,730
Gotta go outta here!

4409
03:02:51,850 --> 03:02:52,850
Gotta go to the pop-it!

4410
03:02:54,350 --> 03:02:56,690
Okay, but what if I go home instead?

4411
03:02:57,490 --> 03:02:58,210
Can I...

4412
03:02:59,430 --> 03:03:00,530
Like, do I...

4413
03:03:00,530 --> 03:03:01,250
Do I...

4414
03:03:01,870 --> 03:03:05,550
Isn't there a kid that's been waiting for me at the library for, like, 20 years?

4415
03:03:10,020 --> 03:03:12,040
Like, I feel like I've been...

4416
03:03:13,320 --> 03:03:14,380
Oh, hey there!

4417
03:03:14,520 --> 03:03:15,120
Hey, kid!

4418
03:03:15,520 --> 03:03:16,500
I'm fire...

4419
03:03:16,960 --> 03:03:18,020
Hey, firecracker kid!

4420
03:03:18,360 --> 03:03:19,880
Oh, she's still there!

4421
03:03:20,700 --> 03:03:22,140
You still wanna trade for one?

4422
03:03:22,420 --> 03:03:23,360
Yeah, I have this.

4423
03:03:23,560 --> 03:03:25,380
Wait, what am I supposed to be trading with him?

4424
03:03:25,860 --> 03:03:26,620
Like, tickets?

4425
03:03:28,060 --> 03:03:29,120
What does he want?

4426
03:03:31,100 --> 03:03:33,540
Like, what does firecracker kid even want?

4427
03:03:33,640 --> 03:03:34,520
Do you want my tickets?

4428
03:03:34,960 --> 03:03:35,820
The gun!

4429
03:03:36,820 --> 03:03:37,860
The gun!

4430
03:03:39,280 --> 03:03:41,740
I feel like I don't need firecrackers anyway.

4431
03:03:43,480 --> 03:03:45,320
Nah, I'm gonna keep it.

4432
03:03:45,400 --> 03:03:46,620
I don't need firecrackers.

4433
03:03:47,420 --> 03:03:47,940
Alright.

4434
03:03:48,680 --> 03:03:50,360
I'm gonna go to the pizzeria.

4435
03:03:51,640 --> 03:03:52,660
The gun!

4436
03:03:53,980 --> 03:03:56,280
No, you're not fucking taking my gun!

4437
03:04:01,690 --> 03:04:02,190
Alright.

4438
03:04:02,770 --> 03:04:03,530
Back in.

4439
03:04:03,570 --> 03:04:03,990
There we go.

4440
03:04:06,330 --> 03:04:08,090
I don't think I can go back.

4441
03:04:08,250 --> 03:04:08,850
Oh, where's Jeff?

4442
03:04:09,950 --> 03:04:10,450
Jeff?

4443
03:04:12,130 --> 03:04:13,150
Wait, where is Jeff?

4444
03:04:13,490 --> 03:04:14,290
Oh, there's Jeff!

4445
03:04:14,690 --> 03:04:15,430
Hey, kid.

4446
03:04:15,590 --> 03:04:16,630
Shouldn't you be in school?

4447
03:04:19,510 --> 03:04:20,890
Um, not today.

4448
03:04:22,970 --> 03:04:23,470
Hmm.

4449
03:04:23,750 --> 03:04:24,250
Okay.

4450
03:04:25,130 --> 03:04:26,570
You know where to find me.

4451
03:04:30,580 --> 03:04:31,220
Let's see.

4452
03:04:31,540 --> 03:04:33,100
Now's my chance to get a head start.

4453
03:04:34,180 --> 03:04:34,740
Oh, yeah.

4454
03:04:34,740 --> 03:04:36,560
Wouldn't it be daytime by then?

4455
03:04:40,650 --> 03:04:41,910
Oh, I do need it?

4456
03:04:42,010 --> 03:04:42,510
Wait, okay.

4457
03:04:43,290 --> 03:04:43,990
Okay, guys.

4458
03:04:44,030 --> 03:04:45,110
I'm going back to the kid.

4459
03:04:45,170 --> 03:04:47,310
Wait, isn't he supposed to be at school?

4460
03:04:47,750 --> 03:04:48,570
Wait a minute!

4461
03:04:49,770 --> 03:04:50,770
Wait a minute!

4462
03:04:51,730 --> 03:04:53,770
That kid's supposed to be in school too!

4463
03:04:55,050 --> 03:04:55,490
Like...

4464
03:04:55,490 --> 03:04:57,230
I just realized!

4465
03:04:57,990 --> 03:04:59,510
Wait, he's looking ditchy school!

4466
03:05:01,230 --> 03:05:04,110
Okay, he's just like in the firecracker kit.

4467
03:05:04,190 --> 03:05:04,870
Don't care.

4468
03:05:05,290 --> 03:05:06,230
He's too cool.

4469
03:05:06,430 --> 03:05:07,290
He's too cool!

4470
03:05:07,610 --> 03:05:08,490
Oh, I can't.

4471
03:05:08,510 --> 03:05:09,830
Oh, I was gonna say can I not leave?

4472
03:05:10,550 --> 03:05:10,990
Alright.

4473
03:05:19,280 --> 03:05:19,720
Okay.

4474
03:05:20,060 --> 03:05:21,180
What does he want?

4475
03:05:22,480 --> 03:05:24,060
Guys, what can I trade for him?

4476
03:05:25,280 --> 03:05:26,080
You want this?

4477
03:05:26,360 --> 03:05:27,420
That's not cool enough.

4478
03:05:27,580 --> 03:05:29,180
Give me something a little more retro.

4479
03:05:30,300 --> 03:05:30,880
What the?

4480
03:05:31,940 --> 03:05:32,380
This?

4481
03:05:32,880 --> 03:05:34,100
That's not cool enough.

4482
03:05:34,260 --> 03:05:35,740
Give me something a little more retro.

4483
03:05:36,600 --> 03:05:37,720
What the fuck?

4484
03:05:37,940 --> 03:05:38,980
I have a gun?

4485
03:05:39,960 --> 03:05:40,400
Oh.

4486
03:05:41,300 --> 03:05:42,340
That's not cool.

4487
03:05:42,420 --> 03:05:43,640
I have a gun.

4488
03:05:47,340 --> 03:05:48,500
What the fuck?

4489
03:05:49,840 --> 03:05:52,140
A gun is not cool enough, guys.

4490
03:05:54,360 --> 03:05:56,600
Oh, retro.

4491
03:05:56,740 --> 03:05:57,860
Oh my god.

4492
03:05:58,020 --> 03:05:58,860
What do you...

4493
03:05:58,860 --> 03:06:00,460
I got a ticket counter.

4494
03:06:00,820 --> 03:06:03,400
Is that about your validator?

4495
03:06:05,020 --> 03:06:06,360
What's cool enough?

4496
03:06:06,780 --> 03:06:07,320
What?

4497
03:06:09,220 --> 03:06:10,800
What's cool enough?

4498
03:06:11,240 --> 03:06:13,160
I'm not cool enough for him.

4499
03:06:16,540 --> 03:06:17,140
Okay.

4500
03:06:17,980 --> 03:06:20,960
Apparently, apparently I'm not cool enough for him.

4501
03:06:22,440 --> 03:06:24,760
He keeps telling me I'm not cool enough.

4502
03:06:27,920 --> 03:06:28,520
Alright.

4503
03:06:28,520 --> 03:06:29,120
Apparently.

4504
03:06:29,860 --> 03:06:32,000
Maybe, maybe I can trade something here.

4505
03:06:33,440 --> 03:06:33,920
Yeah.

4506
03:06:35,380 --> 03:06:36,140
Oh, no.

4507
03:06:36,200 --> 03:06:36,880
Everything is broken.

4508
03:06:40,700 --> 03:06:41,180
Yeah.

4509
03:06:43,420 --> 03:06:43,900
Wait.

4510
03:06:43,900 --> 03:06:44,380
Unless...

4511
03:06:46,040 --> 03:06:47,420
Can I use any of this?

4512
03:06:52,190 --> 03:06:52,910
Electron gun?

4513
03:06:53,510 --> 03:06:54,650
I can't use that.

4514
03:06:54,690 --> 03:06:55,530
I can't use anything!

4515
03:06:55,770 --> 03:06:56,530
What's the point?

4516
03:06:57,750 --> 03:06:58,230
Wait.

4517
03:06:59,070 --> 03:06:59,550
Maybe?

4518
03:07:02,050 --> 03:07:03,170
I don't have the right...

4519
03:07:03,170 --> 03:07:05,170
What would this... What would this need?

4520
03:07:07,030 --> 03:07:08,070
Wolf power?

4521
03:07:08,350 --> 03:07:08,570
Wolf power?

4522
03:07:09,030 --> 03:07:10,270
What would you need?

4523
03:07:10,370 --> 03:07:10,950
Wooden balls?

4524
03:07:14,180 --> 03:07:16,040
It says I have the item.

4525
03:07:17,640 --> 03:07:18,920
What would the item be?

4526
03:07:21,740 --> 03:07:22,640
Oh, shit!

4527
03:07:22,780 --> 03:07:23,200
Oh, shit!

4528
03:07:25,500 --> 03:07:26,500
What did I do?

4529
03:07:27,180 --> 03:07:27,700
What did I do?

4530
03:07:27,700 --> 03:07:28,120
Oh!

4531
03:07:30,240 --> 03:07:33,800
Well, I watched Dad repair so many random things over the... Oh, I did it!

4532
03:07:34,300 --> 03:07:34,920
What is this?

4533
03:07:36,540 --> 03:07:37,020
What game is this?

4534
03:07:40,280 --> 03:07:41,360
Oh, guys!

4535
03:07:42,000 --> 03:07:45,080
I gotta get... I'm so swollen, Freddy!

4536
03:07:45,360 --> 03:07:46,100
Oh, God!

4537
03:07:46,200 --> 03:07:46,920
Oh, God!

4538
03:07:47,020 --> 03:07:48,340
I gotta do my reps!

4539
03:07:48,580 --> 03:07:50,380
I gotta do my reps!

4540
03:07:51,380 --> 03:07:52,840
Am I swollen enough?

4541
03:07:54,580 --> 03:07:55,180
Yay!

4542
03:07:56,260 --> 03:07:58,820
Why is that bear so swollen?

4543
03:07:59,760 --> 03:08:00,360
Yippee!

4544
03:08:01,700 --> 03:08:03,740
This is enough for a voucher.

4545
03:08:04,560 --> 03:08:06,280
Guys, I'm so swollen now!

4546
03:08:06,960 --> 03:08:07,560
Yay!

4547
03:08:08,100 --> 03:08:08,600
Hahaha!

4548
03:08:11,320 --> 03:08:13,420
Okay, it has to be one of these items.

4549
03:08:17,020 --> 03:08:19,000
What do I can exchange for, then?

4550
03:08:19,420 --> 03:08:20,280
Alright, what's this?

4551
03:08:21,400 --> 03:08:22,480
Shoot the balloons.

4552
03:08:22,900 --> 03:08:23,220
Oh!

4553
03:08:23,420 --> 03:08:25,340
It's like space... Wait, what is it called?

4554
03:08:26,160 --> 03:08:27,800
Um... Oh, my... Oh!

4555
03:08:28,500 --> 03:08:29,440
Did I win?

4556
03:08:32,970 --> 03:08:34,230
Oh, I didn't win.

4557
03:08:34,850 --> 03:08:35,930
It's like asteroids?

4558
03:08:36,130 --> 03:08:36,690
Oh, my God!

4559
03:08:36,730 --> 03:08:37,530
That's so retro!

4560
03:08:40,150 --> 03:08:41,630
That's so fucking retro!

4561
03:08:41,850 --> 03:08:42,390
Oh, my God!

4562
03:08:42,950 --> 03:08:43,570
Oh, God!

4563
03:08:43,750 --> 03:08:44,190
Oh...

4564
03:08:46,630 --> 03:08:47,070
Oh!

4565
03:08:47,070 --> 03:08:47,510
Okay.

4566
03:08:48,930 --> 03:08:49,930
Alright, we're okay.

4567
03:08:50,730 --> 03:08:51,730
What's the high score?

4568
03:08:51,830 --> 03:08:53,250
What score do I need to get?

4569
03:08:53,970 --> 03:08:55,490
Do I just need to destroy all of it?

4570
03:08:56,930 --> 03:08:57,370
Okay.

4571
03:08:58,050 --> 03:08:58,890
It's asteroid.

4572
03:09:00,010 --> 03:09:00,450
Alright.

4573
03:09:00,450 --> 03:09:01,150
Come on.

4574
03:09:01,210 --> 03:09:01,510
Come on.

4575
03:09:01,550 --> 03:09:01,910
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

4576
03:09:05,010 --> 03:09:05,890
Oh, no!

4577
03:09:07,190 --> 03:09:07,630
Please!

4578
03:09:07,770 --> 03:09:09,290
Do I get tickets now?

4579
03:09:10,330 --> 03:09:10,970
Please, no!

4580
03:09:11,350 --> 03:09:12,330
It has to be ticket.

4581
03:09:12,450 --> 03:09:13,290
I did so much!

4582
03:09:17,770 --> 03:09:18,170
What?

4583
03:09:18,210 --> 03:09:18,370
Oh!

4584
03:09:18,490 --> 03:09:19,190
Oh, I got tickets!

4585
03:09:19,310 --> 03:09:19,510
Okay.

4586
03:09:20,170 --> 03:09:21,590
Okay, it says I got tickets.

4587
03:09:21,830 --> 03:09:22,510
Okay, that...

4588
03:09:23,010 --> 03:09:23,590
That's good.

4589
03:09:24,370 --> 03:09:25,790
I got two tickets from that.

4590
03:09:28,510 --> 03:09:30,410
Alright, this is like skee-ba.

4591
03:09:32,050 --> 03:09:33,430
We don't care about skee-ba.

4592
03:09:34,070 --> 03:09:35,470
Wait, can I do this, then?

4593
03:09:37,470 --> 03:09:38,170
Ticket counter?

4594
03:09:39,570 --> 03:09:40,390
Can I get prizes?

4595
03:09:43,950 --> 03:09:44,490
Uh...

4596
03:09:44,490 --> 03:09:45,570
No?

4597
03:09:45,950 --> 03:09:46,490
Puzzle?

4598
03:09:46,890 --> 03:09:47,790
Control panel?

4599
03:09:49,230 --> 03:09:49,770
Oh!

4600
03:09:51,270 --> 03:09:53,250
Oh, I have enough for a prize voucher!

4601
03:09:54,110 --> 03:09:56,570
But like, where do I get my prizes?

4602
03:09:58,950 --> 03:09:59,490
Where?

4603
03:10:00,210 --> 03:10:00,750
Here?

4604
03:10:01,050 --> 03:10:01,850
Oh, shit.

4605
03:10:03,630 --> 03:10:04,170
Uh...

4606
03:10:05,030 --> 03:10:06,290
Can I use that here?

4607
03:10:06,690 --> 03:10:07,270
Oh, here!

4608
03:10:08,310 --> 03:10:11,050
Can I get the, the, the, the firecracker now?

4609
03:10:14,070 --> 03:10:14,870
I'm very...

4610
03:10:14,870 --> 03:10:16,030
Why would... You want some...

4611
03:10:16,030 --> 03:10:16,450
Yes!

4612
03:10:16,710 --> 03:10:17,270
Yes!

4613
03:10:19,570 --> 03:10:20,350
Oh, my God!

4614
03:10:20,370 --> 03:10:20,750
Finally!

4615
03:10:21,210 --> 03:10:21,770
Finally!

4616
03:10:22,070 --> 03:10:23,830
I have something that's retro!

4617
03:10:24,290 --> 03:10:25,850
I finally did it!

4618
03:10:27,470 --> 03:10:28,450
Oh, my God!

4619
03:10:28,550 --> 03:10:28,830
Good!

4620
03:10:29,590 --> 03:10:30,710
I got it!

4621
03:10:30,750 --> 03:10:31,670
Got the retro!

4622
03:10:33,010 --> 03:10:33,650
Let's go!

4623
03:10:35,190 --> 03:10:35,990
Oh, my God!

4624
03:10:36,030 --> 03:10:36,410
Finally!

4625
03:10:36,470 --> 03:10:38,490
I've got the firecrackers!

4626
03:10:40,130 --> 03:10:41,690
I got a Game Boy!

4627
03:10:45,670 --> 03:10:46,350
Oh, my God!

4628
03:10:46,430 --> 03:10:47,090
Thank God!

4629
03:10:48,330 --> 03:10:48,810
Alright.

4630
03:10:48,930 --> 03:10:50,170
I got the thing.

4631
03:10:50,810 --> 03:10:52,130
I got the cool thing.

4632
03:10:52,670 --> 03:10:53,410
Oh, nice!

4633
03:10:53,630 --> 03:10:55,050
You got yourself a trade!

4634
03:10:56,050 --> 03:10:56,530
Awesome!

4635
03:10:56,610 --> 03:10:57,030
Thanks!

4636
03:10:58,050 --> 03:10:59,630
Pleasure doing business with ya!

4637
03:11:00,350 --> 03:11:00,830
Nice.

4638
03:11:00,850 --> 03:11:01,030
Okay.

4639
03:11:01,390 --> 03:11:05,770
I have no idea, like, what to do with the, uh...

4640
03:11:06,270 --> 03:11:08,290
What to do with the, uh...

4641
03:11:08,290 --> 03:11:09,810
The firecrackers.

4642
03:11:09,810 --> 03:11:11,250
But you guys said we needed it.

4643
03:11:11,510 --> 03:11:12,790
I can't believe you wouldn't take the gun!

4644
03:11:14,790 --> 03:11:15,950
I'm so cool now.

4645
03:11:16,650 --> 03:11:18,010
I'm so fucking cool.

4646
03:11:18,410 --> 03:11:20,050
He thinks I'm cool now.

4647
03:11:21,690 --> 03:11:23,570
Now I have a better reputation.

4648
03:11:25,370 --> 03:11:27,810
I literally fixed his arcade machines for free.

4649
03:11:27,970 --> 03:11:32,690
And then, like, uh, made him up his power bill by, like, 50%.

4650
03:11:32,690 --> 03:11:34,070
He won't notice, right?

4651
03:11:34,170 --> 03:11:35,970
He's not gonna notice the power bill went up.

4652
03:11:37,950 --> 03:11:39,370
Toki, you got robbed!

4653
03:11:40,370 --> 03:11:42,430
I could've sold that on eBay!

4654
03:11:44,490 --> 03:11:45,530
It's retro!

4655
03:11:45,710 --> 03:11:47,490
I could've got so much money!

4656
03:11:49,590 --> 03:11:50,230
Huh?

4657
03:11:54,890 --> 03:11:55,870
Night 4.

4658
03:11:56,090 --> 03:11:57,450
Wait, it's night time?

4659
03:12:01,010 --> 03:12:02,690
You gotta be kidding me.

4660
03:12:02,730 --> 03:12:03,890
How many kids did...

4661
03:12:03,890 --> 03:12:05,110
Wait, they tried more?

4662
03:12:05,410 --> 03:12:06,970
I freed Chip and Mike!

4663
03:12:07,670 --> 03:12:09,050
Alright, it's time.

4664
03:12:09,930 --> 03:12:11,770
The cops must work here.

4665
03:12:13,970 --> 03:12:14,610
Okay.

4666
03:12:15,430 --> 03:12:16,310
9-1-1.

4667
03:12:17,430 --> 03:12:19,750
There's no way the budget's worse down here.

4668
03:12:20,890 --> 03:12:21,790
Unfortunately... What?

4669
03:12:22,070 --> 03:12:22,530
Still?

4670
03:12:24,010 --> 03:12:25,070
I'm in 1985!

4671
03:12:26,810 --> 03:12:28,050
How is this still?

4672
03:12:31,410 --> 03:12:32,330
It's 1985!

4673
03:12:34,610 --> 03:12:36,010
Okay, but where do I have to...

4674
03:12:36,010 --> 03:12:36,070
Oh.

4675
03:12:37,910 --> 03:12:38,910
That was close.

4676
03:12:39,290 --> 03:12:40,250
Where do I have to go?

4677
03:12:45,020 --> 03:12:46,820
Yeah, what if I call my mom in the past?

4678
03:12:47,420 --> 03:12:47,620
Right.

4679
03:12:48,060 --> 03:12:48,880
Okay, guys.

4680
03:12:50,180 --> 03:12:51,820
What's my mom's phone number again?

4681
03:12:52,120 --> 03:12:52,860
Whoops, not that.

4682
03:12:54,480 --> 03:12:55,340
What was it?

4683
03:12:58,910 --> 03:12:59,730
I forgot.

4684
03:12:59,850 --> 03:13:01,150
I forgot my mom's phone number.

4685
03:13:01,230 --> 03:13:02,670
555 something something something.

4686
03:13:03,910 --> 03:13:04,430
555.

4687
03:13:04,550 --> 03:13:05,730
Oh, my contacts!

4688
03:13:05,790 --> 03:13:06,330
You're right!

4689
03:13:06,730 --> 03:13:09,350
I don't need... I don't need backseating.

4690
03:13:11,750 --> 03:13:12,270
Mom?

4691
03:13:12,270 --> 03:13:12,350
Mom?

4692
03:13:16,550 --> 03:13:17,030
Oswald?

4693
03:13:18,750 --> 03:13:20,130
Is everything alright, honey?

4694
03:13:20,450 --> 03:13:20,930
Yeah.

4695
03:13:21,330 --> 03:13:21,810
Just...

4696
03:13:21,810 --> 03:13:23,790
Has dad been acting weird to you?

4697
03:13:24,390 --> 03:13:25,590
He's been a bit quiet.

4698
03:13:25,650 --> 03:13:26,630
But that's just work stress.

4699
03:13:26,970 --> 03:13:27,950
Don't worry, Oswald.

4700
03:13:28,150 --> 03:13:28,810
He's okay.

4701
03:13:29,850 --> 03:13:32,190
How do I get reception in 1985?

4702
03:13:33,970 --> 03:13:37,830
Guys, I don't think I was meant to make that call in 1985.

4703
03:13:37,830 --> 03:13:38,250
1985.

4704
03:13:42,330 --> 03:13:44,730
Okay, I have no idea where I'm supposed to go.

4705
03:13:46,150 --> 03:13:47,190
Where's the child?

4706
03:13:50,530 --> 03:13:51,170
Oh, hey.

4707
03:13:52,110 --> 03:13:52,990
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

4708
03:13:53,330 --> 03:13:54,090
Not here.

4709
03:13:54,570 --> 03:13:55,230
Not here.

4710
03:13:56,330 --> 03:13:57,150
Not here.

4711
03:13:57,290 --> 03:13:58,090
Not here.

4712
03:13:58,130 --> 03:13:58,310
Not here.

4713
03:13:58,310 --> 03:13:58,550
Not here.

4714
03:14:02,210 --> 03:14:02,670
Oh!

4715
03:14:05,170 --> 03:14:07,190
The call of 85.

4716
03:14:15,960 --> 03:14:18,020
Oh, why are you back here?

4717
03:14:19,880 --> 03:14:20,800
Hello?

4718
03:14:27,540 --> 03:14:29,240
Back in the bed I go.

4719
03:14:30,080 --> 03:14:31,480
They don't know.

4720
03:14:31,500 --> 03:14:33,480
They knew.

4721
03:14:34,700 --> 03:14:35,740
They knew.

4722
03:14:37,140 --> 03:14:38,780
I thought I could go somewhere else.

4723
03:14:39,060 --> 03:14:40,440
I thought I could go.

4724
03:14:40,560 --> 03:14:42,340
But you fucking snitch.

4725
03:14:42,360 --> 03:14:43,460
You fucking...

4726
03:14:47,960 --> 03:14:49,160
Holy shit.

4727
03:14:50,120 --> 03:14:50,720
Okay.

4728
03:14:52,920 --> 03:14:54,080
Oh my god, dude.

4729
03:14:54,140 --> 03:14:54,720
Fuck Chica.

4730
03:14:55,300 --> 03:14:56,320
That bitch.

4731
03:14:58,480 --> 03:15:00,000
Where's that other scream?

4732
03:15:01,440 --> 03:15:03,520
I have no idea where the other scream is.

4733
03:15:04,320 --> 03:15:05,940
Is it the security room?

4734
03:15:09,040 --> 03:15:11,720
Where is the other scream coming from, chat?

4735
03:15:14,500 --> 03:15:15,720
I have no idea.

4736
03:15:18,000 --> 03:15:18,640
Uh...

4737
03:15:19,760 --> 03:15:21,240
God damn it.

4738
03:15:21,300 --> 03:15:22,400
Chica's a snitch.

4739
03:15:22,920 --> 03:15:24,600
She's a fucking snitch.

4740
03:15:27,860 --> 03:15:28,500
Whoa.

4741
03:15:28,820 --> 03:15:30,020
Is there a battery?

4742
03:15:30,640 --> 03:15:31,280
Imagine.

4743
03:15:32,400 --> 03:15:33,560
Oh, here!

4744
03:15:33,940 --> 03:15:34,800
Oh, okay.

4745
03:15:34,860 --> 03:15:35,240
Never mind.

4746
03:15:35,360 --> 03:15:35,900
Not here.

4747
03:15:38,600 --> 03:15:39,780
Is this the security room?

4748
03:15:40,000 --> 03:15:41,160
I don't think I've been to the security.

4749
03:15:41,340 --> 03:15:41,500
Yeah.

4750
03:15:42,780 --> 03:15:43,660
You fucking...

4751
03:15:43,660 --> 03:15:44,460
bitch.

4752
03:15:48,640 --> 03:15:50,740
I don't remember what the game was for this.

4753
03:15:50,980 --> 03:15:52,300
I don't remember what the...

4754
03:15:52,300 --> 03:15:54,860
what the minigame was for this one.

4755
03:15:56,040 --> 03:15:56,380
Oh.

4756
03:15:58,000 --> 03:16:00,120
It took her fucking forever to find me.

4757
03:16:01,040 --> 03:16:02,860
Please, go anywhere but here.

4758
03:16:04,340 --> 03:16:04,780
Oh.

4759
03:16:05,240 --> 03:16:06,340
Chica, you whore.

4760
03:16:08,220 --> 03:16:10,060
Chica, you fucking whore.

4761
03:16:10,900 --> 03:16:11,540
No!

4762
03:16:12,080 --> 03:16:14,240
Why are you at the fucking security?

4763
03:16:15,680 --> 03:16:18,700
That's literally the one thing I had to go.

4764
03:16:19,280 --> 03:16:21,420
I had to go there.

4765
03:16:26,320 --> 03:16:27,200
Oh my god.

4766
03:16:27,240 --> 03:16:27,760
Leave!

4767
03:16:28,500 --> 03:16:29,140
Leave!

4768
03:16:29,840 --> 03:16:30,480
Chica!

4769
03:16:30,480 --> 03:16:30,500
Chica!

4770
03:16:35,300 --> 03:16:37,100
You bitch!

4771
03:16:37,100 --> 03:16:37,700
Leave!

4772
03:16:38,640 --> 03:16:41,280
Oh my god!

4773
03:16:41,520 --> 03:16:42,880
You need to fucking...

4774
03:16:42,880 --> 03:16:44,360
I gave you pizza!

4775
03:16:44,820 --> 03:16:46,720
I gave you pizza!

4776
03:16:50,110 --> 03:16:51,780
You whore, whore, whore.

4777
03:16:51,780 --> 03:16:52,460
Whore, whore.

4778
03:16:54,800 --> 03:16:57,460
You whore, whore, whore.

4779
03:16:57,460 --> 03:16:58,360
Whore, whore, whore.

4780
03:16:59,180 --> 03:17:00,160
Whore, whore, whore.

4781
03:17:00,880 --> 03:17:01,680
Oh!

4782
03:17:05,960 --> 03:17:07,480
That's fucking right.

4783
03:17:08,140 --> 03:17:09,860
Get fire crackered!

4784
03:17:12,460 --> 03:17:14,520
There's another child here?

4785
03:17:15,580 --> 03:17:16,920
Hello, child.

4786
03:17:17,220 --> 03:17:18,040
What's this?

4787
03:17:20,540 --> 03:17:21,340
Oh.

4788
03:17:25,480 --> 03:17:26,980
Oh, I don't like this.

4789
03:17:31,060 --> 03:17:31,260
Oh.

4790
03:17:35,140 --> 03:17:36,260
I don't like that.

4791
03:17:39,420 --> 03:17:39,900
Okay.

4792
03:17:42,060 --> 03:17:43,140
Oh, there's the phone.

4793
03:17:43,540 --> 03:17:44,980
I can't imagine that you...

4794
03:17:49,710 --> 03:17:50,850
I don't know.

4795
03:17:50,910 --> 03:17:51,470
I'm worried.

4796
03:17:51,630 --> 03:17:53,110
I'm worried, phone guy.

4797
03:17:53,750 --> 03:17:55,010
If you really have...

4798
03:18:01,470 --> 03:18:02,790
No, that's okay.

4799
03:18:02,890 --> 03:18:03,930
I don't want to do that.

4800
03:18:05,450 --> 03:18:06,250
That's okay.

4801
03:18:06,350 --> 03:18:06,990
Who are you?

4802
03:18:07,030 --> 03:18:08,210
I've never seen you before.

4803
03:18:08,510 --> 03:18:09,130
Oh, hey.

4804
03:18:09,150 --> 03:18:10,050
That's dad's wedding ring.

4805
03:18:11,890 --> 03:18:12,950
Oh, batteries!

4806
03:18:13,110 --> 03:18:13,910
I need that.

4807
03:18:14,570 --> 03:18:15,310
Here.

4808
03:18:15,510 --> 03:18:16,310
They're close.

4809
03:18:16,850 --> 03:18:17,590
What?

4810
03:18:17,790 --> 03:18:18,310
Who?

4811
03:18:18,910 --> 03:18:20,310
The cameras.

4812
03:18:21,880 --> 03:18:22,250
What?

4813
03:18:25,550 --> 03:18:26,290
Alright.

4814
03:18:28,230 --> 03:18:28,970
Okay.

4815
03:18:31,750 --> 03:18:33,510
Looking at the cameras.

4816
03:18:33,810 --> 03:18:35,970
None of the cameras work.

4817
03:18:36,290 --> 03:18:37,250
Oh, shit!

4818
03:18:39,510 --> 03:18:40,250
Oh.

4819
03:18:40,250 --> 03:18:40,570
Oh.

4820
03:18:40,630 --> 03:18:40,970
Oh.

4821
03:18:40,970 --> 03:18:41,330
Oh.

4822
03:18:41,510 --> 03:18:41,950
Follow me.

4823
03:18:42,010 --> 03:18:42,830
We have to get out of here.

4824
03:18:43,450 --> 03:18:44,710
They're still out there.

4825
03:18:45,090 --> 03:18:46,550
I need to get them away from here.

4826
03:18:49,050 --> 03:18:51,170
I probably shouldn't call attention to myself.

4827
03:18:52,650 --> 03:18:53,790
Do I leave?

4828
03:19:03,450 --> 03:19:04,390
What do I do?

4829
03:19:06,030 --> 03:19:06,470
What?

4830
03:19:10,790 --> 03:19:11,770
Why do I...

4831
03:19:15,280 --> 03:19:16,480
There's nobody here?

4832
03:19:22,210 --> 03:19:24,310
They wouldn't let me press the big red button.

4833
03:19:28,650 --> 03:19:29,970
Is it radio time?

4834
03:19:31,890 --> 03:19:32,930
Is it radio time?

4835
03:19:33,410 --> 03:19:33,790
Maybe.

4836
03:19:36,150 --> 03:19:36,670
Okay.

4837
03:19:37,630 --> 03:19:38,710
I'm gonna do the radio.

4838
03:19:39,730 --> 03:19:40,810
It's radio time.

4839
03:19:42,670 --> 03:19:43,790
It's time to dance.

4840
03:19:44,410 --> 03:19:45,970
It's time to dance, everybody.

4841
03:19:46,550 --> 03:19:46,630
It's time to dance, everybody.

4842
03:19:47,090 --> 03:19:48,570
Oh, I don't like that.

4843
03:19:48,930 --> 03:19:50,230
Hey, let me look into here.

4844
03:19:51,650 --> 03:19:52,170
Surely.

4845
03:19:52,690 --> 03:19:55,210
Surely nothing bad will happen if I do that.

4846
03:19:55,470 --> 03:19:55,550
Surely nothing bad will happen if I do that.

4847
03:19:57,470 --> 03:19:57,910
Maybe.

4848
03:19:59,990 --> 03:20:01,890
Time to dance, everybody.

4849
03:20:01,970 --> 03:20:03,470
It's time to dance.

4850
03:20:03,790 --> 03:20:06,030
It's time to dance, everybody.

4851
03:20:07,010 --> 03:20:07,650
Okay.

4852
03:20:08,130 --> 03:20:09,210
That should work.

4853
03:20:09,410 --> 03:20:11,770
Thank God I hoarded all my batteries.

4854
03:20:12,510 --> 03:20:13,550
Thank God.

4855
03:20:16,130 --> 03:20:16,930
All right.

4856
03:20:17,450 --> 03:20:18,310
Oh, shit.

4857
03:20:18,350 --> 03:20:18,850
Balloon Boy.

4858
03:20:19,090 --> 03:20:20,610
No, where did she go?

4859
03:20:30,040 --> 03:20:31,200
What the fuck?

4860
03:20:35,680 --> 03:20:36,560
Where is she?

4861
03:20:38,460 --> 03:20:39,020
Where is she?

4862
03:20:39,200 --> 03:20:40,440
That's Big Spider.

4863
03:20:41,960 --> 03:20:44,800
I didn't know there was fucking spider animatronics, too.

4864
03:20:45,520 --> 03:20:46,080
I didn't know there was fucking spider animatronics, too.

4865
03:20:48,440 --> 03:20:49,000
Oh.

4866
03:20:51,220 --> 03:20:52,720
Where is he taking her?

4867
03:20:54,340 --> 03:20:54,900
What?

4868
03:21:01,030 --> 03:21:02,450
Where did he take her?

4869
03:21:03,090 --> 03:21:03,650
Yeah.

4870
03:21:06,490 --> 03:21:07,950
Look for the child.

4871
03:21:07,950 --> 03:21:08,350
Child!

4872
03:21:08,630 --> 03:21:10,890
Where the fuck did he take the child?

4873
03:21:14,870 --> 03:21:15,430
Child?

4874
03:21:20,750 --> 03:21:22,430
Child, are you here?

4875
03:21:24,710 --> 03:21:26,370
Child, I thought you were scared!

4876
03:21:27,510 --> 03:21:28,470
You liar!

4877
03:21:28,830 --> 03:21:29,810
You fucking liar!

4878
03:21:29,930 --> 03:21:31,430
You told me you were scared!

4879
03:21:31,630 --> 03:21:33,670
And then you fucking follow a stranger?

4880
03:21:34,450 --> 03:21:35,910
Pick a struggle!

4881
03:21:36,190 --> 03:21:36,950
Pick a lane!

4882
03:21:37,990 --> 03:21:39,310
I know she's in here.

4883
03:21:39,390 --> 03:21:40,210
She has to be in the freezer.

4884
03:21:41,270 --> 03:21:43,690
I bet I can find something to smash it.

4885
03:21:43,870 --> 03:21:46,310
I need to get that girl out there before she freezes.

4886
03:21:47,730 --> 03:21:49,950
I need to get something to smash it?

4887
03:21:52,850 --> 03:21:54,230
Oh no, please stop crying.

4888
03:21:54,590 --> 03:21:56,170
Please, you're only making me more...

4889
03:21:56,830 --> 03:21:58,750
No, I didn't realize that was noise!

4890
03:22:01,070 --> 03:22:01,950
The hammer!

4891
03:22:02,150 --> 03:22:02,990
There's a hammer?

4892
03:22:04,270 --> 03:22:05,710
When did I have a hammer?

4893
03:22:08,830 --> 03:22:09,270
Goodbye.

4894
03:22:12,800 --> 03:22:14,080
Where's the fucking hammer?

4895
03:22:15,600 --> 03:22:16,040
Oh!

4896
03:22:16,280 --> 03:22:16,780
The arcade!

4897
03:22:16,940 --> 03:22:17,160
The arcade!

4898
03:22:17,280 --> 03:22:17,540
The arcade!

4899
03:22:17,640 --> 03:22:18,400
I knew it!

4900
03:22:18,440 --> 03:22:19,200
I fucking knew it!

4901
03:22:19,760 --> 03:22:21,520
Don't worry, I always knew where the hammer was.

4902
03:22:24,940 --> 03:22:25,780
Don't worry, guys.

4903
03:22:26,000 --> 03:22:27,620
I always knew where it was.

4904
03:22:27,700 --> 03:22:28,140
Chat.

4905
03:22:30,720 --> 03:22:32,220
Okay, it's like this way.

4906
03:22:33,980 --> 03:22:34,420
Okay.

4907
03:22:38,420 --> 03:22:38,860
Oh.

4908
03:22:39,620 --> 03:22:40,760
A spooky...

4909
03:22:41,540 --> 03:22:42,640
Please stop crying!

4910
03:22:43,060 --> 03:22:44,020
You did this!

4911
03:22:44,060 --> 03:22:45,360
You literally held...

4912
03:22:47,520 --> 03:22:48,000
Oh!

4913
03:22:51,360 --> 03:22:52,960
What does... What does that do?

4914
03:22:53,960 --> 03:22:56,200
Like, what... What does... He just said, hey.

4915
03:22:57,100 --> 03:22:58,620
What did he...

4916
03:22:59,820 --> 03:23:01,000
Oh, that's the phone.

4917
03:23:01,760 --> 03:23:03,200
That I'm not gonna take.

4918
03:23:04,480 --> 03:23:05,620
Like, what... What the...

4919
03:23:05,620 --> 03:23:07,600
Oh hey, no, there is a phone here.

4920
03:23:08,040 --> 03:23:08,400
Hello?

4921
03:23:08,400 --> 03:23:08,980
Hello?

4922
03:23:09,340 --> 03:23:09,380
Hello?

4923
03:23:10,040 --> 03:23:10,500
What

4924
03:23:16,470 --> 03:23:18,930
the fuck are you talking about?

4925
03:23:19,510 --> 03:23:21,270
I don't even know what I'm looking at.

4926
03:23:25,620 --> 03:23:27,040
I mean, look at the sketchbook.

4927
03:23:27,460 --> 03:23:28,520
I was gonna eat this cupcake.

4928
03:23:29,960 --> 03:23:31,620
Oh, he blocks the door.

4929
03:23:31,700 --> 03:23:33,180
Okay, I was gonna just be like, what are you doing, Freddy?

4930
03:23:33,480 --> 03:23:33,840
What are...

4931
03:23:33,840 --> 03:23:34,780
All right,

4932
03:23:40,670 --> 03:23:41,170
phone guy.

4933
03:23:41,730 --> 03:23:43,370
All right, whatever you say.

4934
03:23:51,760 --> 03:23:52,840
She's over there.

4935
03:23:53,760 --> 03:23:54,220
Leave.

4936
03:23:55,320 --> 03:23:56,880
No, she's getting closer.

4937
03:23:57,340 --> 03:23:58,380
Come on!

4938
03:23:58,520 --> 03:24:00,280
I just wanna grab the hat.

4939
03:24:08,540 --> 03:24:09,300
Fucking freak.

4940
03:24:09,980 --> 03:24:10,960
Oh, that was close.

4941
03:24:11,180 --> 03:24:12,700
That was pretty close.

4942
03:24:12,740 --> 03:24:15,420
That was like one second.

4943
03:24:15,780 --> 03:24:17,160
Oh, that was one second.

4944
03:24:18,780 --> 03:24:20,020
I'm gonna walk.

4945
03:24:20,160 --> 03:24:21,080
I'm gonna walk.

4946
03:24:21,460 --> 03:24:22,180
And then I'm gonna...

4947
03:24:22,180 --> 03:24:22,640
Yoink.

4948
03:24:22,640 --> 03:24:23,440
Come on now.

4949
03:24:24,740 --> 03:24:25,260
Yoink.

4950
03:24:25,260 --> 03:24:26,120
Come on now.

4951
03:24:27,800 --> 03:24:28,640
What am I saying?

4952
03:24:28,640 --> 03:24:29,680
I just bashed the head.

4953
03:24:31,260 --> 03:24:34,360
Why can't I just like swing the hammer at the fucking animatronics?

4954
03:24:34,780 --> 03:24:38,420
To be fair, I'm a child, so I don't think that's gonna cause much damage.

4955
03:24:38,820 --> 03:24:40,400
Now that I think about it.

4956
03:24:41,480 --> 03:24:42,320
Fucking freak.

4957
03:24:43,740 --> 03:24:44,220
Okay.

4958
03:24:45,800 --> 03:24:46,920
Oh God, please.

4959
03:24:47,000 --> 03:24:49,000
I don't wanna do this all over again, please.

4960
03:24:53,500 --> 03:24:53,980
Oh...

4961
03:25:08,960 --> 03:25:09,440
No!

4962
03:25:09,440 --> 03:25:09,920
No!

4963
03:25:09,920 --> 03:25:10,380
No!

4964
03:25:11,240 --> 03:25:11,620
No!

4965
03:25:12,580 --> 03:25:13,620
Don't trip!

4966
03:25:13,800 --> 03:25:14,080
No!

4967
03:25:15,020 --> 03:25:15,740
No!

4968
03:25:15,760 --> 03:25:16,260
Closet!

4969
03:25:23,410 --> 03:25:25,510
I thought that was the closet!

4970
03:25:26,750 --> 03:25:27,470
No!

4971
03:25:28,950 --> 03:25:30,710
I legit thought that was...

4972
03:25:30,710 --> 03:25:32,350
I fucking hate you!

4973
03:25:32,510 --> 03:25:34,030
I hate you, child!

4974
03:25:34,390 --> 03:25:35,730
I hate you all over again!

4975
03:25:35,870 --> 03:25:38,070
You fucking stupid bitch!

4976
03:25:43,780 --> 03:25:45,220
You fucking...

4977
03:25:45,220 --> 03:25:46,960
Oh my God.

4978
03:25:49,740 --> 03:25:50,660
That bitch!

4979
03:25:51,100 --> 03:25:55,160
She's the one that fucking followed the goddamn animatronic too!

4980
03:25:56,840 --> 03:25:57,300
Okay.

4981
03:25:58,740 --> 03:26:00,480
God, why do I have to save her?

4982
03:26:00,640 --> 03:26:02,360
I should be able to pick and choose who I wanna save.

4983
03:26:02,480 --> 03:26:03,160
I don't wanna save her.

4984
03:26:03,400 --> 03:26:06,160
I don't wanna save her.

4985
03:26:07,020 --> 03:26:08,080
I hate her.

4986
03:26:09,460 --> 03:26:10,940
Out of all the children.

4987
03:26:11,140 --> 03:26:13,980
Out of all the kids in this stupid pizzeria.

4988
03:26:14,340 --> 03:26:15,900
She's the one that deserves to die.

4989
03:26:19,480 --> 03:26:20,780
Oh my God.

4990
03:26:23,060 --> 03:26:23,700
Oh my God.

4991
03:26:24,580 --> 03:26:25,960
Oh my God.

4992
03:26:26,320 --> 03:26:27,600
I like how...

4993
03:26:28,320 --> 03:26:31,640
I don't question the giant fucking spider, I guess.

4994
03:26:33,100 --> 03:26:33,860
Am I okay?

4995
03:26:33,860 --> 03:26:34,600
I am not okay.

4996
03:26:34,780 --> 03:26:35,620
I am not okay.

4997
03:26:35,660 --> 03:26:36,800
I have to do this all over again.

4998
03:26:36,900 --> 03:26:38,070
I am not okay.

4999
03:26:41,300 --> 03:26:45,880
I have to do this fucking shit all over again.

5000
03:26:45,880 --> 03:26:47,340
Again, I'm not okay.

5001
03:26:47,520 --> 03:26:49,180
I thought...

5002
03:26:51,480 --> 03:26:52,660
Okay, that's fine.

5003
03:26:52,820 --> 03:26:53,760
Just let me through.

5004
03:26:59,350 --> 03:27:00,470
Okay, there we go.

5005
03:27:01,650 --> 03:27:02,130
Okay.

5006
03:27:03,610 --> 03:27:05,710
Alright, let me... I'm just gonna...

5007
03:27:06,230 --> 03:27:06,930
I'm gonna go here.

5008
03:27:07,290 --> 03:27:08,390
I'm gonna go here.

5009
03:27:08,450 --> 03:27:09,850
I'm gonna go into my time machine.

5010
03:27:10,430 --> 03:27:12,670
You can't catch me if I'm in my time machine!

5011
03:27:12,670 --> 03:27:13,430
I...

5012
03:27:16,670 --> 03:27:18,250
I'm so sad.

5013
03:27:18,510 --> 03:27:20,310
I wish it saves here.

5014
03:27:20,510 --> 03:27:24,010
The fact that it doesn't save here is the worst part.

5015
03:27:24,190 --> 03:27:26,510
I think that's the worst part.

5016
03:27:26,590 --> 03:27:28,370
It doesn't save here.

5017
03:27:31,490 --> 03:27:32,930
Are you... Bro!

5018
03:27:33,190 --> 03:27:35,470
What the fuck, bro!

5019
03:27:36,850 --> 03:27:37,490
Fuck you!

5020
03:27:38,450 --> 03:27:39,450
Actually, fuck you.

5021
03:27:39,490 --> 03:27:40,310
You fucking camper.

5022
03:27:42,670 --> 03:27:43,170
Okay.

5023
03:27:43,770 --> 03:27:45,150
Back at it we go.

5024
03:27:50,490 --> 03:27:51,010
Okay.

5025
03:27:51,010 --> 03:27:53,110
There's no way he's there twice, right?

5026
03:27:53,770 --> 03:27:54,770
There's no way.

5027
03:27:54,930 --> 03:27:56,910
It better reset twice, right?

5028
03:28:03,550 --> 03:28:04,710
I hear him.

5029
03:28:07,130 --> 03:28:08,050
I hear him.

5030
03:28:08,130 --> 03:28:09,650
He's like far to the left.

5031
03:28:10,210 --> 03:28:10,730
Okay.

5032
03:28:11,830 --> 03:28:12,350
Alright.

5033
03:28:12,350 --> 03:28:14,010
And then I'm gonna bump into Chica.

5034
03:28:14,610 --> 03:28:16,710
Get away from me, you fucking bitch.

5035
03:28:16,710 --> 03:28:17,890
I see your hand, Bonnie.

5036
03:28:18,110 --> 03:28:19,730
I see your fucking hand.

5037
03:28:20,050 --> 03:28:21,990
This game is supposed to be three hours long.

5038
03:28:27,490 --> 03:28:27,950
Okay.

5039
03:28:43,470 --> 03:28:44,470
Why does it honk?

5040
03:28:44,550 --> 03:28:45,310
It's fucking cardboard!

5041
03:28:50,260 --> 03:28:50,860
Where is he?

5042
03:28:55,680 --> 03:28:56,020
Go right.

5043
03:28:56,020 --> 03:28:56,640
Go right.

5044
03:28:56,680 --> 03:28:57,260
Go right.

5045
03:28:57,340 --> 03:28:57,880
Go right.

5046
03:29:02,180 --> 03:29:04,100
Oh, that was close.

5047
03:29:05,400 --> 03:29:08,480
That was... I didn't know... It's cardboard!

5048
03:29:09,820 --> 03:29:11,460
Cardboard doesn't go boop!

5049
03:29:12,420 --> 03:29:13,920
Cardboard doesn't go boop!

5050
03:29:14,900 --> 03:29:17,080
What kind of cardboard is that?

5051
03:29:24,950 --> 03:29:25,730
Oh, God.

5052
03:29:25,870 --> 03:29:26,470
Oh, God.

5053
03:29:26,490 --> 03:29:27,630
I heard something to my right.

5054
03:29:29,750 --> 03:29:31,570
I heard something to my right.

5055
03:29:33,030 --> 03:29:33,610
Okay.

5056
03:29:37,210 --> 03:29:37,790
Okay.

5057
03:29:40,250 --> 03:29:40,830
Okay.

5058
03:29:41,670 --> 03:29:43,330
This is gonna be rough.

5059
03:29:46,630 --> 03:29:47,210
Okay.

5060
03:29:47,570 --> 03:29:48,910
I'm just gonna hide in here.

5061
03:29:49,050 --> 03:29:51,690
I'm gonna hide in here until Springtrap appears.

5062
03:29:52,630 --> 03:29:54,710
I'm gonna... I can't... I can't...

5063
03:29:58,430 --> 03:29:59,230
I hear him.

5064
03:30:00,450 --> 03:30:01,790
Where is he coming from?

5065
03:30:03,630 --> 03:30:04,270
Where...

5066
03:30:06,890 --> 03:30:08,370
Where is he coming from?

5067
03:30:10,210 --> 03:30:11,270
I hear him.

5068
03:30:12,390 --> 03:30:15,050
I hear his little fucking... big-ass paws!

5069
03:30:21,430 --> 03:30:21,750
Leave.

5070
03:30:22,090 --> 03:30:22,530
Leave.

5071
03:30:24,950 --> 03:30:25,590
Leave.

5072
03:30:25,870 --> 03:30:26,470
Leave.

5073
03:30:26,610 --> 03:30:27,150
Please leave!

5074
03:30:29,550 --> 03:30:29,930
Okay.

5075
03:30:31,630 --> 03:30:32,470
I don't wanna run.

5076
03:30:32,570 --> 03:30:33,030
I don't wanna run.

5077
03:30:33,070 --> 03:30:34,150
He's literally outside the door.

5078
03:30:35,150 --> 03:30:36,070
He's literally outside.

5079
03:30:36,290 --> 03:30:37,870
They have things I do for this child.

5080
03:30:38,150 --> 03:30:39,470
For this stupid kid.

5081
03:30:41,170 --> 03:30:41,550
Okay.

5082
03:30:42,410 --> 03:30:42,970
Get out.

5083
03:30:43,630 --> 03:30:44,410
Get out of here.

5084
03:30:47,470 --> 03:30:47,850
Oh.

5085
03:30:49,270 --> 03:30:49,830
Get out.

5086
03:30:50,170 --> 03:30:50,650
Got it.

5087
03:30:53,070 --> 03:30:53,450
Child.

5088
03:30:54,310 --> 03:30:55,350
Are you dead?

5089
03:30:56,690 --> 03:30:58,390
God fucking dammit!

5090
03:30:58,570 --> 03:31:00,030
I knew I should've just left her!

5091
03:31:02,110 --> 03:31:02,590
Oh.

5092
03:31:03,430 --> 03:31:03,910
Okay.

5093
03:31:03,970 --> 03:31:04,370
You're alive.

5094
03:31:04,570 --> 03:31:04,830
Okay.

5095
03:31:05,470 --> 03:31:05,950
Nevermind.

5096
03:31:06,090 --> 03:31:07,030
I saved the day.

5097
03:31:07,450 --> 03:31:07,930
Yeah.

5098
03:31:07,950 --> 03:31:08,450
You say?

5099
03:31:08,570 --> 03:31:11,630
You literally followed the animatronic, you fucker!

5100
03:31:11,650 --> 03:31:12,190
You bitch!

5101
03:31:12,510 --> 03:31:15,630
Run to the exit before...

5102
03:31:16,230 --> 03:31:16,470
Oh.

5103
03:31:16,490 --> 03:31:16,810
Okay.

5104
03:31:17,010 --> 03:31:17,490
Goodbye.

5105
03:31:20,590 --> 03:31:21,070
Alright.

5106
03:31:22,070 --> 03:31:22,550
Oh!

5107
03:31:22,570 --> 03:31:22,770
Oh!

5108
03:31:22,850 --> 03:31:22,990
Oh!

5109
03:31:22,990 --> 03:31:23,150
Oh!

5110
03:31:23,190 --> 03:31:23,410
Oh!

5111
03:31:23,470 --> 03:31:23,630
Oh!

5112
03:31:23,630 --> 03:31:24,070
No!

5113
03:31:24,150 --> 03:31:24,650
He grabbed me!

5114
03:31:26,250 --> 03:31:26,750
Get out!

5115
03:31:26,810 --> 03:31:27,090
Get away!

5116
03:31:28,290 --> 03:31:28,610
No.

5117
03:31:28,670 --> 03:31:28,750
No.

5118
03:31:28,870 --> 03:31:28,990
No.

5119
03:31:28,990 --> 03:31:29,150
No.

5120
03:31:29,150 --> 03:31:29,330
No.

5121
03:31:29,330 --> 03:31:29,470
No.

5122
03:31:29,470 --> 03:31:29,570
No.

5123
03:31:29,570 --> 03:31:29,650
No.

5124
03:31:29,650 --> 03:31:29,730
No.

5125
03:31:29,730 --> 03:31:29,790
No.

5126
03:31:31,330 --> 03:31:33,770
I swear the fucking God get me out of here!

5127
03:31:34,050 --> 03:31:35,410
Get me the fuck out of here!

5128
03:31:36,790 --> 03:31:37,770
Get me out of here.

5129
03:31:37,790 --> 03:31:38,390
Get me out of here.

5130
03:31:38,430 --> 03:31:39,010
Get me out of here.

5131
03:31:39,590 --> 03:31:40,510
Hot tub time machine!

5132
03:31:40,610 --> 03:31:40,910
Let's go!

5133
03:31:45,910 --> 03:31:46,230
Okay.

5134
03:31:47,010 --> 03:31:48,650
This keeps getting worse and worse.

5135
03:31:49,510 --> 03:31:50,690
This ends tomorrow!

5136
03:31:54,470 --> 03:31:57,790
It's into the pit, not run out of the pit.

5137
03:31:58,870 --> 03:32:00,470
Debbie, thank you for the super chat.

5138
03:32:00,570 --> 03:32:02,770
You're in too deep, kid!

5139
03:32:03,330 --> 03:32:07,290
Guys, I think... I think I fucked up, guys.

5140
03:32:12,090 --> 03:32:12,930
Where's the chili?

5141
03:32:12,990 --> 03:32:13,630
Is that ketchup?

5142
03:32:13,990 --> 03:32:15,410
Because it came from a pizzeria?

5143
03:32:16,530 --> 03:32:17,530
Oh, no!

5144
03:32:20,770 --> 03:32:22,810
Did I sleep all day?

5145
03:32:23,070 --> 03:32:24,450
I'm running out of time!

5146
03:32:24,870 --> 03:32:27,850
No more school, no more distractions, I'm bringing Dad home!

5147
03:32:28,550 --> 03:32:29,610
Oh, no.

5148
03:32:30,530 --> 03:32:32,710
I lived the hardest part.

5149
03:32:34,510 --> 03:32:36,230
I fucked up.

5150
03:32:36,730 --> 03:32:40,310
The last day, I have to move the ladder.

5151
03:32:40,730 --> 03:32:46,470
On the last day, I have to move the fucking ladder.

5152
03:32:46,790 --> 03:32:47,510
I have to move the fucking ladder.

5153
03:32:49,990 --> 03:32:50,470
No!

5154
03:32:52,470 --> 03:32:52,950
No!

5155
03:32:53,450 --> 03:32:54,710
Wait, where's the ladder go?

5156
03:32:54,930 --> 03:32:55,470
Wait a minute.

5157
03:32:55,570 --> 03:32:57,230
Wait, where did the ladder go?

5158
03:32:57,670 --> 03:33:00,150
Wait, can I just leave the front door?

5159
03:33:00,430 --> 03:33:01,530
Wait, where's the ladder?

5160
03:33:03,050 --> 03:33:03,790
Where is it?

5161
03:33:04,390 --> 03:33:05,230
Where's the ladder?

5162
03:33:06,050 --> 03:33:06,850
Where's the cat?

5163
03:33:08,150 --> 03:33:09,410
No, the cat's at the fridge.

5164
03:33:09,450 --> 03:33:10,470
It's night time, guys.

5165
03:33:11,230 --> 03:33:12,450
The cat's at the fridge.

5166
03:33:14,330 --> 03:33:15,290
It's night time.

5167
03:33:22,070 --> 03:33:24,390
Wait, is Dad not here?

5168
03:33:25,810 --> 03:33:27,030
Wait, where is Dad?

5169
03:33:27,970 --> 03:33:29,570
What is all that sound?

5170
03:33:30,590 --> 03:33:31,990
Where is... wait, it's daytime!

5171
03:33:32,530 --> 03:33:33,210
Wait, you're right!

5172
03:33:35,370 --> 03:33:35,930
Wait...

5173
03:33:38,010 --> 03:33:40,030
Oh, 555-5333.

5174
03:33:40,210 --> 03:33:41,550
Oh, hey, I could call Jess Pizza.

5175
03:33:42,890 --> 03:33:43,450
Cat?

5176
03:33:43,450 --> 03:33:44,350
Where's the cat?

5177
03:33:45,950 --> 03:33:47,470
Where did the cat go?

5178
03:33:49,490 --> 03:33:50,210
Cat?

5179
03:33:51,830 --> 03:33:53,510
Wait, cat gone.

5180
03:33:55,210 --> 03:33:57,550
Wait, what happened to cat?

5181
03:33:59,370 --> 03:34:02,350
I remembered when I was happy like that photo.

5182
03:34:03,230 --> 03:34:06,230
Okay, time to go to the ball pit again.

5183
03:34:06,970 --> 03:34:09,110
How is there still children there?

5184
03:34:10,170 --> 03:34:10,890
How?

5185
03:34:16,750 --> 03:34:17,470
Pizzeria.

5186
03:34:17,470 --> 03:34:18,810
Day 5.

5187
03:34:18,810 --> 03:34:19,390
Day 5.

5188
03:34:22,830 --> 03:34:24,350
Oh, Freddy's Pizza.

5189
03:34:24,890 --> 03:34:29,710
When I go in there, I'm not sure if I'll come back out.

5190
03:34:30,290 --> 03:34:33,110
But I guess I'm as ready as I'll ever be.

5191
03:34:33,390 --> 03:34:35,990
All right, here I go.

5192
03:34:36,590 --> 03:34:37,550
Here I go.

5193
03:34:40,030 --> 03:34:40,590
Okay.

5194
03:34:43,750 --> 03:34:45,510
It's me, Mario.

5195
03:34:47,810 --> 03:34:48,690
It's me, Mario.

5196
03:34:48,690 --> 03:34:49,470
It's a me.

5197
03:34:51,070 --> 03:34:51,510
Hello?

5198
03:34:52,410 --> 03:34:52,850
Jeff?

5199
03:34:54,350 --> 03:34:55,790
Jeff, where did you go?

5200
03:34:55,950 --> 03:34:56,390
Jeff?

5201
03:34:59,330 --> 03:34:59,770
Jeff?

5202
03:35:02,050 --> 03:35:03,690
Oh, oh, there's people here.

5203
03:35:05,290 --> 03:35:06,170
Oh, okay.

5204
03:35:06,850 --> 03:35:07,630
Fuck me.

5205
03:35:07,750 --> 03:35:08,790
He doesn't want to talk to me.

5206
03:35:09,570 --> 03:35:10,010
Jeff?

5207
03:35:10,190 --> 03:35:11,250
Where did Jeff go?

5208
03:35:12,950 --> 03:35:14,030
No, no more.

5209
03:35:14,190 --> 03:35:16,670
But I want to know where did Jeff...

5210
03:35:16,670 --> 03:35:17,330
Oh, no.

5211
03:35:17,330 --> 03:35:18,750
What about Foxy?

5212
03:35:19,270 --> 03:35:21,850
It's night five and there's no Foxy.

5213
03:35:22,410 --> 03:35:23,610
I don't like that.

5214
03:35:24,930 --> 03:35:26,230
Where did Jeff go?

5215
03:35:27,410 --> 03:35:27,890
Jeff?

5216
03:35:29,770 --> 03:35:31,150
Jeff, where are you, Jeff?

5217
03:35:31,570 --> 03:35:33,030
I don't know where you are.

5218
03:35:34,070 --> 03:35:34,550
Jeff?

5219
03:35:36,570 --> 03:35:37,930
Are you in the security?

5220
03:35:39,990 --> 03:35:40,470
Oh!

5221
03:35:42,490 --> 03:35:43,530
Okay, Jeff.

5222
03:35:43,930 --> 03:35:45,670
You not get internet here?

5223
03:35:46,430 --> 03:35:47,650
What the fuck?

5224
03:35:48,070 --> 03:35:49,530
What you doing there, Jeff?

5225
03:35:50,550 --> 03:35:51,790
What's it look like, kid?

5226
03:35:51,930 --> 03:35:52,570
I'm working.

5227
03:35:53,270 --> 03:35:55,890
You barge in here to ask about the room of the ball pit?

5228
03:35:56,010 --> 03:35:57,690
No, I'm not opening the door.

5229
03:35:58,350 --> 03:35:58,690
Huh?

5230
03:35:59,010 --> 03:36:00,210
What are you talking about?

5231
03:36:01,130 --> 03:36:08,870
Had to start locking a door because some hooligans kept sneaking in and leaving those balls all over the place.

5232
03:36:09,150 --> 03:36:10,310
Bro, Jeff's gaming.

5233
03:36:10,470 --> 03:36:11,230
Bro, look at him go.

5234
03:36:11,350 --> 03:36:12,670
Holy shit, he's so fast.

5235
03:36:12,870 --> 03:36:13,650
Look at him go.

5236
03:36:13,650 --> 03:36:14,950
His fucking...

5237
03:36:16,570 --> 03:36:17,430
Oh, my God.

5238
03:36:17,870 --> 03:36:20,890
What is his finger speed?

5239
03:36:21,170 --> 03:36:21,730
Look at him go.

5240
03:36:21,770 --> 03:36:22,930
His APM, bro.

5241
03:36:23,690 --> 03:36:26,230
You wouldn't happen to know anything about that, would you?

5242
03:36:27,490 --> 03:36:27,970
No.

5243
03:36:28,470 --> 03:36:29,490
I mean, no.

5244
03:36:29,570 --> 03:36:30,450
I have no idea.

5245
03:36:31,990 --> 03:36:32,910
He's winning.

5246
03:36:33,490 --> 03:36:34,250
Do I...

5247
03:36:34,250 --> 03:36:35,730
You need to get into the...

5248
03:36:35,730 --> 03:36:39,850
I mean, I left my jacket in the room with the ball pit the other day.

5249
03:36:39,910 --> 03:36:40,990
Can you let me in there?

5250
03:36:41,930 --> 03:36:42,930
Nice try, kid.

5251
03:36:42,930 --> 03:36:45,950
You're wearing the exact same jacket you wore when you went in.

5252
03:36:46,710 --> 03:36:47,590
No, I'm not.

5253
03:36:47,650 --> 03:36:49,110
This is my backup jacket.

5254
03:36:49,490 --> 03:36:52,250
We're in a video game, so I wear the same clothes every day.

5255
03:36:53,050 --> 03:36:54,730
The other one has my wallet.

5256
03:36:54,870 --> 03:36:56,550
I kind of need to buy pizza.

5257
03:36:57,750 --> 03:36:58,330
Oh, yeah.

5258
03:36:58,370 --> 03:36:59,250
That's pretty important.

5259
03:36:59,850 --> 03:37:01,010
Here, take the key.

5260
03:37:01,130 --> 03:37:03,130
But don't go play around that ball pit anymore.

5261
03:37:03,710 --> 03:37:06,750
I promise I'll stay out there as soon as I'm done.

5262
03:37:07,090 --> 03:37:09,570
Never want to see that thing again anyway.

5263
03:37:10,930 --> 03:37:12,010
That gross, huh?

5264
03:37:12,710 --> 03:37:14,350
You have no idea.

5265
03:37:15,490 --> 03:37:16,370
All right, nice.

5266
03:37:16,530 --> 03:37:18,230
Actually, I just wanted to visit Jeff.

5267
03:37:18,350 --> 03:37:21,470
I didn't realize that was part of the mission, you know, to...

5268
03:37:22,750 --> 03:37:24,490
Wait, what the...

5269
03:37:26,470 --> 03:37:27,810
Jeff, do you not see this?

5270
03:37:27,910 --> 03:37:28,190
Jeff!

5271
03:37:29,130 --> 03:37:29,570
Jeff!

5272
03:37:30,970 --> 03:37:31,770
Oh, shit.

5273
03:37:31,810 --> 03:37:32,570
This is the kitchen.

5274
03:37:32,650 --> 03:37:33,790
I lost track of my...

5275
03:37:34,710 --> 03:37:37,310
Oh, shit.

5276
03:37:37,450 --> 03:37:38,210
Oh, shit.

5277
03:37:38,250 --> 03:37:39,290
Jeff, I fucked up.

5278
03:37:39,450 --> 03:37:40,690
I forgot where I was.

5279
03:37:45,030 --> 03:37:46,230
Oh, shit.

5280
03:37:47,250 --> 03:37:47,850
Oh, shit.

5281
03:37:47,850 --> 03:37:48,130
Oh, shit.

5282
03:37:48,130 --> 03:37:49,410
I didn't know where I was.

5283
03:37:49,630 --> 03:37:50,710
I thought that was...

5284
03:37:52,350 --> 03:37:54,790
I was going to bring in the Jeff.

5285
03:37:57,130 --> 03:37:57,730
Whoa!

5286
03:37:58,050 --> 03:37:58,650
Okay.

5287
03:37:59,030 --> 03:37:59,910
Fine, dad.

5288
03:38:00,430 --> 03:38:01,490
Like, ow!

5289
03:38:03,150 --> 03:38:05,090
What do you mean fine, dad?

5290
03:38:05,270 --> 03:38:07,350
Where have I not gone?

5291
03:38:08,870 --> 03:38:10,770
What the fuck do you...

5292
03:38:10,770 --> 03:38:11,110
Ugh.

5293
03:38:12,650 --> 03:38:13,390
Oh, shit.

5294
03:38:18,570 --> 03:38:22,370
Oh my god.

5295
03:38:24,050 --> 03:38:25,450
Please don't open.

5296
03:38:26,710 --> 03:38:27,190
Okay.

5297
03:38:28,010 --> 03:38:28,970
Okay, we're fine.

5298
03:38:30,010 --> 03:38:30,750
We're fine.

5299
03:38:30,870 --> 03:38:32,030
I guess the party room.

5300
03:38:33,530 --> 03:38:35,070
It has to be the party room.

5301
03:38:35,110 --> 03:38:36,670
I haven't gone to the party room yet.

5302
03:38:39,250 --> 03:38:39,770
Okay.

5303
03:38:39,770 --> 03:38:40,290
Okay.

5304
03:38:41,930 --> 03:38:43,730
He has to go, right?

5305
03:38:44,850 --> 03:38:45,370
Goodbye.

5306
03:38:46,170 --> 03:38:46,970
Goodbye, dad.

5307
03:38:50,580 --> 03:38:51,100
Okay.

5308
03:38:51,780 --> 03:38:52,960
Other dad is gone.

5309
03:38:54,300 --> 03:38:56,360
Other dad is now gone.

5310
03:38:57,640 --> 03:38:58,700
Oh wait, I hear him.

5311
03:38:59,120 --> 03:39:01,300
Let me out of here, you stupid rabbit.

5312
03:39:01,960 --> 03:39:04,160
Hey, are you... there's another child?

5313
03:39:04,360 --> 03:39:05,540
How many kids are there?

5314
03:39:06,160 --> 03:39:08,120
He was locked in here by some stupid rabbit.

5315
03:39:08,120 --> 03:39:08,780
Strange rabbit.

5316
03:39:09,460 --> 03:39:10,380
What the fuck?

5317
03:39:10,440 --> 03:39:12,280
How come the rabbit kills everybody?

5318
03:39:12,600 --> 03:39:15,440
Like, kills me, but he doesn't kill this girl.

5319
03:39:16,520 --> 03:39:19,940
It looks like the door... what kind of party room is that?

5320
03:39:20,460 --> 03:39:20,980
What?

5321
03:39:22,940 --> 03:39:25,180
There's a key I need to get?

5322
03:39:29,630 --> 03:39:31,710
Where the fuck is the other key?

5323
03:39:33,430 --> 03:39:33,950
Okay.

5324
03:39:33,950 --> 03:39:34,870
Party room.

5325
03:39:36,290 --> 03:39:36,810
Okay.

5326
03:39:38,450 --> 03:39:39,850
A key card.

5327
03:39:41,790 --> 03:39:43,910
Where the fuck is the key card?

5328
03:39:45,350 --> 03:39:47,150
I've been to... is it security?

5329
03:39:47,330 --> 03:39:48,670
It should be the security, right?

5330
03:39:49,410 --> 03:39:51,950
Like, I've been to everywhere, but...

5331
03:39:52,590 --> 03:39:55,470
I guess it should be in the security because it's a key card.

5332
03:39:55,570 --> 03:39:55,790
Yeah.

5333
03:39:58,450 --> 03:39:58,970
Yeah.

5334
03:39:58,970 --> 03:39:59,790
It's security.

5335
03:40:00,170 --> 03:40:01,790
That's where security goes.

5336
03:40:03,070 --> 03:40:04,310
Alright, Chica was here.

5337
03:40:04,450 --> 03:40:05,410
So, let's see.

5338
03:40:09,850 --> 03:40:11,790
Oh, I don't like this.

5339
03:40:14,870 --> 03:40:17,730
Are you... I hate you.

5340
03:40:18,150 --> 03:40:21,050
I fucking hate you.

5341
03:40:22,350 --> 03:40:24,870
I fucking hate you, Chica.

5342
03:40:24,990 --> 03:40:26,170
You bitch.

5343
03:40:26,950 --> 03:40:28,990
You fucking bitch.

5344
03:40:30,450 --> 03:40:33,130
Please, I just... you snitch.

5345
03:40:33,510 --> 03:40:35,450
Fucking stitches get stitches.

5346
03:40:35,450 --> 03:40:36,130
Oh,

5347
03:40:41,070 --> 03:40:41,410
my God.

5348
03:40:41,490 --> 03:40:42,430
I fucking hate her.

5349
03:40:50,350 --> 03:40:50,870
Okay.

5350
03:40:50,870 --> 03:40:53,450
The only place... unless it's in the freezer.

5351
03:40:54,150 --> 03:40:55,490
Do you think there's a key card?

5352
03:40:55,630 --> 03:40:57,250
No, the freezer is not an actual place.

5353
03:40:58,030 --> 03:40:58,550
Apparently.

5354
03:41:02,110 --> 03:41:02,970
Oh, hey, coin.

5355
03:41:04,230 --> 03:41:04,750
Okay.

5356
03:41:07,590 --> 03:41:09,110
Are you fucking...

5357
03:41:09,110 --> 03:41:10,890
Oh, my... there's no...

5358
03:41:10,890 --> 03:41:12,970
Oh, I did not want to...

5359
03:41:12,970 --> 03:41:13,570
Oh, okay.

5360
03:41:13,710 --> 03:41:15,830
Hey, did you want to look at the camera?

5361
03:41:16,070 --> 03:41:17,170
Oh, I'm trapped.

5362
03:41:17,470 --> 03:41:17,970
Yeah.

5363
03:41:20,570 --> 03:41:21,070
Yippee.

5364
03:41:28,110 --> 03:41:29,790
Like, where could it be?

5365
03:41:31,070 --> 03:41:32,110
Oh, they...

5366
03:41:32,950 --> 03:41:34,350
Okay, they put that back.

5367
03:41:35,490 --> 03:41:37,530
Where could the card be?

5368
03:41:39,850 --> 03:41:41,310
I think Chica hates me.

5369
03:41:46,610 --> 03:41:47,250
Oh, no.

5370
03:41:47,310 --> 03:41:48,070
Fuck you two.

5371
03:41:49,450 --> 03:41:50,370
What the fuck?

5372
03:41:50,390 --> 03:41:50,810
They blocked?

5373
03:41:51,390 --> 03:41:51,790
Okay.

5374
03:41:51,830 --> 03:41:54,530
Well, at least Bonnie and Freddy aren't going to do anything to me.

5375
03:41:55,110 --> 03:41:56,130
Is it in the oven?

5376
03:42:00,030 --> 03:42:00,930
There's no way.

5377
03:42:02,330 --> 03:42:02,730
Okay.

5378
03:42:02,810 --> 03:42:03,010
Yeah.

5379
03:42:03,070 --> 03:42:04,390
You guys are... I got one guide.

5380
03:42:07,010 --> 03:42:07,410
Okay.

5381
03:42:07,410 --> 03:42:08,430
I got it.

5382
03:42:08,470 --> 03:42:08,770
I got it.

5383
03:42:08,770 --> 03:42:09,950
We got to go to...

5384
03:42:10,390 --> 03:42:12,150
We got to go to the basement.

5385
03:42:12,150 --> 03:42:14,950
If they're blocking the basement, then it has to be in the basement.

5386
03:42:16,070 --> 03:42:17,090
Because why would they...

5387
03:42:26,200 --> 03:42:27,880
I didn't fucking know.

5388
03:42:27,960 --> 03:42:28,980
I didn't think he'd be there.

5389
03:42:33,140 --> 03:42:34,460
How is that supposed to do?

5390
03:42:34,500 --> 03:42:35,620
He's going to come over me.

5391
03:42:36,420 --> 03:42:37,240
Oh, okay.

5392
03:42:38,840 --> 03:42:39,780
I think I got in time.

5393
03:42:40,980 --> 03:42:41,520
All right.

5394
03:42:41,540 --> 03:42:41,900
There we go.

5395
03:42:42,640 --> 03:42:44,400
I thought I could Metal Gear.

5396
03:42:44,640 --> 03:42:46,480
I thought I could Metal Gear that shit.

5397
03:42:46,500 --> 03:42:47,500
I fucking know.

5398
03:42:50,200 --> 03:42:50,640
Okay.

5399
03:42:50,640 --> 03:42:51,320
Bye, spiders.

5400
03:42:53,060 --> 03:42:53,640
All right.

5401
03:42:56,280 --> 03:42:56,720
Okay.

5402
03:42:56,820 --> 03:42:57,800
We have to go to the basement.

5403
03:42:59,080 --> 03:42:59,520
Okay.

5404
03:42:59,520 --> 03:43:00,900
And I got sneak there.

5405
03:43:01,420 --> 03:43:02,280
I go here.

5406
03:43:04,260 --> 03:43:05,140
And then...

5407
03:43:06,020 --> 03:43:07,820
God, I'm going to hear this phone ring forever.

5408
03:43:10,660 --> 03:43:11,620
And I go here.

5409
03:43:14,100 --> 03:43:14,980
And then...

5410
03:43:14,980 --> 03:43:16,220
Oh, fuck this.

5411
03:43:16,500 --> 03:43:17,640
What's the worst that's going to happen?

5412
03:43:19,060 --> 03:43:21,780
Wouldn't it be funny if the worst did happen there?

5413
03:43:24,340 --> 03:43:24,880
Okay.

5414
03:43:30,560 --> 03:43:31,620
Hey, there's something here.

5415
03:43:32,440 --> 03:43:32,980
Okay.

5416
03:43:33,000 --> 03:43:33,340
Token.

5417
03:43:36,040 --> 03:43:36,580
Okay.

5418
03:43:36,660 --> 03:43:37,880
There has to be something here.

5419
03:43:39,160 --> 03:43:40,480
Like they're guarding something.

5420
03:43:40,720 --> 03:43:42,660
Where did all these things come from?

5421
03:43:43,600 --> 03:43:44,140
What?

5422
03:43:44,630 --> 03:43:45,460
The animatronic?

5423
03:43:51,300 --> 03:43:53,640
It looks like there's something shoved into one of them.

5424
03:43:53,860 --> 03:43:54,920
That has to be the key card.

5425
03:43:55,980 --> 03:43:56,340
Yes.

5426
03:44:00,080 --> 03:44:00,440
Okay.

5427
03:44:00,440 --> 03:44:01,120
We did it.

5428
03:44:06,070 --> 03:44:06,430
Okay.

5429
03:44:07,850 --> 03:44:08,470
Come on.

5430
03:44:09,050 --> 03:44:09,590
Come on.

5431
03:44:13,740 --> 03:44:14,100
Okay.

5432
03:44:14,100 --> 03:44:15,120
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

5433
03:44:16,580 --> 03:44:17,660
What's the worst that could happen?

5434
03:44:18,060 --> 03:44:18,740
Oh, okay.

5435
03:44:18,840 --> 03:44:20,040
Me trying to find the key card.

5436
03:44:20,100 --> 03:44:20,500
That's the one.

5437
03:44:21,980 --> 03:44:23,340
It's not first slot.

5438
03:44:23,420 --> 03:44:26,280
That's the worst that could happen.

5439
03:44:28,980 --> 03:44:29,620
Thank you.

5440
03:44:29,680 --> 03:44:31,260
I thought I was done for.

5441
03:44:31,980 --> 03:44:34,800
Before you get out of here, I'm looking for my dad.

5442
03:44:35,620 --> 03:44:36,720
Have you seen him?

5443
03:44:37,460 --> 03:44:39,160
No, I haven't seen anyone else.

5444
03:44:39,440 --> 03:44:42,500
I've been hearing weird noises coming from the vent here.

5445
03:44:42,940 --> 03:44:45,660
I definitely heard a man mumbling and snoring.

5446
03:44:46,200 --> 03:44:47,440
Wait, who's feeding him?

5447
03:44:47,720 --> 03:44:50,200
It's been five nights and day.

5448
03:44:50,900 --> 03:44:52,900
I think you're clear to run straight to the exit.

5449
03:44:52,960 --> 03:44:53,620
Just be careful.

5450
03:44:53,960 --> 03:44:54,960
Okay, good luck.

5451
03:44:55,220 --> 03:44:58,060
Yeah, why does every fucking animatronic trying to kill me?

5452
03:44:58,120 --> 03:45:00,560
But then they let these guys live.

5453
03:45:00,880 --> 03:45:03,680
Other than the guy would bring damage with the hammer hitting him in the head.

5454
03:45:06,400 --> 03:45:07,200
There's a photo.

5455
03:45:09,380 --> 03:45:10,600
Where the fuck's the photo?

5456
03:45:16,140 --> 03:45:16,580
Okay.

5457
03:45:17,280 --> 03:45:18,660
That was not the photo.

5458
03:45:21,840 --> 03:45:22,520
Dad!

5459
03:45:23,060 --> 03:45:23,400
Dad!

5460
03:45:28,110 --> 03:45:28,430
Dad!

5461
03:45:28,430 --> 03:45:29,230
Wait a minute.

5462
03:45:29,370 --> 03:45:30,390
Who's over here?

5463
03:45:32,090 --> 03:45:32,770
Great.

5464
03:45:32,850 --> 03:45:34,310
That bear is out there.

5465
03:45:35,910 --> 03:45:36,590
Hello,

5466
03:45:39,910 --> 03:45:40,390
Dad.

5467
03:45:43,090 --> 03:45:44,750
Wait, inspect my items?

5468
03:45:45,170 --> 03:45:45,610
Why?

5469
03:45:45,950 --> 03:45:47,230
What's in my items?

5470
03:45:48,950 --> 03:45:50,750
The saddest, most utter...

5471
03:45:50,750 --> 03:45:51,710
Okay, family photo.

5472
03:45:52,130 --> 03:45:54,110
Dad took a picture of me and my mom.

5473
03:45:56,010 --> 03:45:58,230
Now mom puts up with us sometimes.

5474
03:45:58,590 --> 03:45:58,970
Aww.

5475
03:46:00,610 --> 03:46:01,370
That's why...

5476
03:46:01,370 --> 03:46:04,870
When her dad's retro shop got a new robot, dad promised...

5477
03:46:04,870 --> 03:46:05,030
Aww.

5478
03:46:06,630 --> 03:46:07,770
Didn't have money.

5479
03:46:08,050 --> 03:46:09,490
Somebody bought it.

5480
03:46:09,850 --> 03:46:12,550
Turns out dad was the one who bought it.

5481
03:46:12,850 --> 03:46:17,710
He worked overtime every day for weeks just so he could surprise me.

5482
03:46:17,950 --> 03:46:19,310
I was so happy.

5483
03:46:19,570 --> 03:46:21,730
Now Springtrap has to work overtime.

5484
03:46:23,090 --> 03:46:26,110
Mom and dad have been great to each other since they were kids.

5485
03:46:26,390 --> 03:46:29,930
They always go through their wedding photo album on the day of their van anniversary.

5486
03:46:30,830 --> 03:46:34,130
I can't even imagine what it'd be like for mom to suddenly lose dad.

5487
03:46:34,970 --> 03:46:35,410
Aww.

5488
03:46:36,350 --> 03:46:37,410
Wait, that's sad.

5489
03:46:39,690 --> 03:46:40,130
Aww.

5490
03:46:44,370 --> 03:46:45,430
Alright, goodbye, dad.

5491
03:46:46,210 --> 03:46:47,210
Oh, I can't leave.

5492
03:46:47,330 --> 03:46:48,110
Okay, I guess.

5493
03:46:50,410 --> 03:46:50,850
Hello?

5494
03:46:52,470 --> 03:46:52,910
Hello?

5495
03:46:52,910 --> 03:46:53,430
Hello, dad?

5496
03:46:57,540 --> 03:46:58,060
Dad?

5497
03:47:00,520 --> 03:47:01,040
Dad?

5498
03:47:02,460 --> 03:47:04,340
Sounds like something is trying to get in.

5499
03:47:04,400 --> 03:47:05,000
I better hide.

5500
03:47:07,740 --> 03:47:08,260
Okay.

5501
03:47:16,090 --> 03:47:18,670
Why did my frame drop after looking at my inventory?

5502
03:47:20,290 --> 03:47:20,810
What

5503
03:47:26,110 --> 03:47:27,590
did my frame drop after?

5504
03:47:27,650 --> 03:47:28,890
Did I fucking get a bug?

5505
03:47:31,910 --> 03:47:34,010
Why did my frames drop?

5506
03:47:38,150 --> 03:47:39,330
I didn't mean that.

5507
03:47:39,410 --> 03:47:48,020
What the f- Wait, what the f- My inventory and my frame started dropping.

5508
03:47:48,960 --> 03:47:51,460
Oh shit, not the ice cream machine.

5509
03:47:54,140 --> 03:47:56,040
Do we have to chase after them?

5510
03:47:56,660 --> 03:47:57,940
What if he's just here?

5511
03:47:58,980 --> 03:48:01,040
Okay, how the fuck do I fix this?

5512
03:48:01,280 --> 03:48:01,960
Is it the ring?

5513
03:48:02,220 --> 03:48:03,520
It has to be the ring.

5514
03:48:06,260 --> 03:48:07,380
Where's the last photo?

5515
03:48:07,380 --> 03:48:09,600
Wait, there's apparently another photo?

5516
03:48:14,930 --> 03:48:16,250
Oh my god, what happened?

5517
03:48:19,190 --> 03:48:20,050
It's okay.

5518
03:48:20,130 --> 03:48:22,190
It's not timed or anything, guys.

5519
03:48:22,990 --> 03:48:26,130
In the Golden Freddy room, I have plenty of time.

5520
03:48:28,590 --> 03:48:30,950
I have plenty of time, guys.

5521
03:48:31,350 --> 03:48:33,830
He's not gonna chase- Oh god!

5522
03:48:34,390 --> 03:48:35,970
That fucking race!

5523
03:48:36,390 --> 03:48:42,650
I literally looked at one item and then my fucking- My fucking frames dropped like hell.

5524
03:48:42,770 --> 03:48:44,790
This is actually crazy.

5525
03:48:48,850 --> 03:48:50,510
Just save that first.

5526
03:48:50,810 --> 03:48:51,410
No.

5527
03:48:53,350 --> 03:48:57,410
Going in and out of- Okay, let's go in and out of those.

5528
03:48:57,690 --> 03:48:58,710
That's actually funny.

5529
03:48:58,950 --> 03:49:04,550
I literally, like, looked at my inventory and then my frames fucking dropped.

5530
03:49:04,910 --> 03:49:07,170
Like, what happened?

5531
03:49:07,830 --> 03:49:12,870
Like, actually- I just wanted to- Oh my god.

5532
03:49:13,090 --> 03:49:15,590
What happened to my frames?

5533
03:49:18,070 --> 03:49:18,630
Jesus.

5534
03:49:21,070 --> 03:49:22,910
I can't- I didn't fix it!

5535
03:49:24,730 --> 03:49:26,030
Where's the last photo?

5536
03:49:26,830 --> 03:49:28,150
Wait, where is it?

5537
03:49:28,830 --> 03:49:30,470
Guys, tell me there's one more photo.

5538
03:49:30,490 --> 03:49:31,270
Where is it?

5539
03:49:32,710 --> 03:49:34,090
No, saving it.

5540
03:49:34,330 --> 03:49:34,870
No!

5541
03:49:35,590 --> 03:49:36,550
Wait, is that it?

5542
03:49:36,790 --> 03:49:38,130
No, that's not a photo.

5543
03:49:38,350 --> 03:49:38,750
Oh my god.

5544
03:49:38,750 --> 03:49:39,050
No!

5545
03:49:39,570 --> 03:49:39,710
No!

5546
03:49:42,650 --> 03:49:44,690
Oh my god, it's in the dining hall.

5547
03:49:45,450 --> 03:49:46,710
Where's the last photo?

5548
03:49:49,030 --> 03:49:51,690
They're not in- I got everything!

5549
03:49:54,350 --> 03:50:00,090
Oh, you need to complete- Bottom the most photos I've seen.

5550
03:50:00,870 --> 03:50:01,910
Where is it?

5551
03:50:01,990 --> 03:50:03,630
Where's the fucking last photo?

5552
03:50:03,950 --> 03:50:04,330
Yeah.

5553
03:50:05,470 --> 03:50:05,790
Okay.

5554
03:50:07,730 --> 03:50:09,790
Bottom right in the- wait, it is?

5555
03:50:11,170 --> 03:50:13,030
Oh no, in the Golden Freddy room.

5556
03:50:15,690 --> 03:50:16,090
Okay.

5557
03:50:16,570 --> 03:50:17,390
Oh god.

5558
03:50:18,830 --> 03:50:20,670
It's okay, nothing can kill me now.

5559
03:50:21,390 --> 03:50:22,750
Nothing can kill me.

5560
03:50:22,830 --> 03:50:23,550
I have it?

5561
03:50:25,630 --> 03:50:27,490
Wait, there's nothing here, you fucking lie!

5562
03:50:27,630 --> 03:50:30,030
Oh hey, there you go, here's dad's name tag.

5563
03:50:30,090 --> 03:50:30,470
I did it!

5564
03:50:30,470 --> 03:50:30,810
Yay!

5565
03:50:31,350 --> 03:50:32,530
I got all five!

5566
03:50:34,370 --> 03:50:35,350
Where's the name tag?

5567
03:50:36,730 --> 03:50:39,510
Dad looks so sad when he told me he lost his job at the mall.

5568
03:50:40,450 --> 03:50:42,390
I don't understand why he kept saying it.

5569
03:50:42,450 --> 03:50:44,510
I'm sorry, I've never thought it was his fault.

5570
03:50:44,650 --> 03:50:45,950
Dad always works so hard.

5571
03:50:46,330 --> 03:50:47,810
I'm glad he's my dad.

5572
03:50:48,690 --> 03:50:49,130
Yay!

5573
03:50:49,290 --> 03:50:49,670
Okay.

5574
03:50:50,230 --> 03:50:51,350
I go to the party.

5575
03:50:51,410 --> 03:50:51,630
Okay.

5576
03:50:51,910 --> 03:50:52,650
We did it.

5577
03:50:53,490 --> 03:50:54,730
I don't know what happened.

5578
03:50:54,750 --> 03:50:58,110
I looked at the inventory and now my frames are gone.

5579
03:50:58,770 --> 03:51:00,090
I saved your frame.

5580
03:51:01,090 --> 03:51:03,650
I activated a glitch apparently.

5581
03:51:05,410 --> 03:51:06,770
I go to the party.

5582
03:51:06,890 --> 03:51:07,590
Oh, there it is!

5583
03:51:09,810 --> 03:51:10,470
What's this?

5584
03:51:10,630 --> 03:51:11,050
A photo?

5585
03:51:11,230 --> 03:51:12,790
Looks like it's pretty scratched up.

5586
03:51:14,070 --> 03:51:14,590
Alright.

5587
03:51:14,590 --> 03:51:15,770
What's the last photo?

5588
03:51:16,910 --> 03:51:20,950
What the f- an odd photo of two men inside of a strange office.

5589
03:51:21,470 --> 03:51:24,130
Is this somewhere inside of Freddy's?

5590
03:51:25,190 --> 03:51:25,710
Okay.

5591
03:51:27,610 --> 03:51:28,710
Alright, here we go.

5592
03:51:29,050 --> 03:51:29,870
Sorry, dad.

5593
03:51:32,750 --> 03:51:33,350
Sorry, dad.

5594
03:51:33,450 --> 03:51:35,670
Your f-ing thing triggered my frames.

5595
03:51:35,830 --> 03:51:37,150
I don't know what hap- Great.

5596
03:51:37,250 --> 03:51:38,310
The bear is out there.

5597
03:51:38,690 --> 03:51:39,370
Wait, what?

5598
03:51:41,810 --> 03:51:42,890
What do I do then?

5599
03:51:45,630 --> 03:51:47,470
Okay, the bear is out there, so...

5600
03:51:52,930 --> 03:51:54,130
Okay, guys.

5601
03:51:54,190 --> 03:51:54,810
I'm restarting.

5602
03:51:54,830 --> 03:51:56,230
I think I should restart the game.

5603
03:51:56,690 --> 03:51:59,890
I- What the f-

5604
03:52:03,080 --> 03:52:03,960
Okay, windowed?

5605
03:52:03,960 --> 03:52:06,260
How the f- do I fix it?

5606
03:52:07,240 --> 03:52:07,960
Okay.

5607
03:52:08,160 --> 03:52:09,220
Maybe this is it.

5608
03:52:09,520 --> 03:52:10,180
No!

5609
03:52:10,400 --> 03:52:11,600
What did I do?

5610
03:52:11,980 --> 03:52:13,460
What did I do?

5611
03:52:13,840 --> 03:52:19,880
What the f- What did I- What did I do?

5612
03:52:24,500 --> 03:52:29,880
I looked- I inspected my inventory and it hasn't been the same since.

5613
03:52:30,160 --> 03:52:32,460
It hasn't been the same since.

5614
03:52:32,880 --> 03:52:33,980
Oh, no.

5615
03:52:33,980 --> 03:52:34,140
No.

5616
03:52:34,820 --> 03:52:35,220
No!

5617
03:52:37,320 --> 03:52:37,720
What?

5618
03:52:40,960 --> 03:52:41,360
Oh!

5619
03:52:42,280 --> 03:52:43,060
Oh, I fixed it!

5620
03:52:43,480 --> 03:52:44,340
I fixed it!

5621
03:52:44,400 --> 03:52:45,320
I went to the ball pit!

5622
03:52:48,800 --> 03:52:50,220
I went to the ball pit!

5623
03:52:50,300 --> 03:52:50,760
I fixed it!

5624
03:52:55,120 --> 03:52:56,580
That's all I had to do.

5625
03:53:01,100 --> 03:53:01,720
Get out!

5626
03:53:01,820 --> 03:53:02,240
Get out!

5627
03:53:02,240 --> 03:53:02,580
What?

5628
03:53:02,620 --> 03:53:03,000
My arm!

5629
03:53:18,600 --> 03:53:20,280
Was that the bite of 35?

5630
03:53:26,980 --> 03:53:28,860
Did he lose to a f- Dad?

5631
03:53:31,540 --> 03:53:32,020
Dad?

5632
03:53:32,920 --> 03:53:35,700
Dad, please?

5633
03:53:36,260 --> 03:53:37,480
No, not dead.

5634
03:53:37,580 --> 03:53:39,520
Please don't be- Dude, he opened his eyes.

5635
03:53:43,000 --> 03:53:45,700
What the- What the heck is that thing?

5636
03:53:46,260 --> 03:53:47,280
What happened, Oswald?

5637
03:53:48,240 --> 03:53:49,200
So, um...

5638
03:53:49,200 --> 03:53:51,820
I hid in the ball pit to play a prank on you.

5639
03:53:51,820 --> 03:53:53,700
Which I shouldn't have done.

5640
03:53:54,720 --> 03:54:00,380
You came to look for me and slipped on the ball- Bro, there's a fucking dead animatronic behind us!

5641
03:54:00,720 --> 03:54:02,080
Why are you lying?

5642
03:54:02,400 --> 03:54:04,900
Must have hit your head pretty hard when you fell.

5643
03:54:05,460 --> 03:54:06,620
I'm sorry, Dad.

5644
03:54:07,660 --> 03:54:09,960
I had many more things to get so out of hand.

5645
03:54:11,420 --> 03:54:13,000
I accept your apology, Os.

5646
03:54:13,200 --> 03:54:14,900
But you're right, you shouldn't have done it.

5647
03:54:15,200 --> 03:54:16,760
Bro, like, five days has passed.

5648
03:54:16,900 --> 03:54:20,520
Wouldn't, like, the wife think- Like, wouldn't everybody think it's weird?

5649
03:54:20,520 --> 03:54:22,160
The wife would be like, Wow, darling.

5650
03:54:22,280 --> 03:54:28,860
Last night, you were like- That would be like the- Is it today, Friday?

5651
03:54:29,180 --> 03:54:30,940
She'll be like, It's Tuesday.

5652
03:54:33,840 --> 03:54:36,360
You and I are beat up pretty good.

5653
03:54:36,840 --> 03:54:38,200
Os, what happened?

5654
03:54:39,900 --> 03:54:41,600
You don't remember anything?

5655
03:54:43,440 --> 03:54:47,160
Well, considering this massive lump on my noggin- No.

5656
03:54:49,020 --> 03:54:49,500
Oh.

5657
03:54:50,380 --> 03:54:53,200
I was mad at you for being late to pick me up again.

5658
03:54:54,120 --> 03:54:57,320
So I decided to hide from you to make you feel as annoyed as I was.

5659
03:54:57,580 --> 03:54:59,560
You slipped on the ball and got knocked out.

5660
03:54:59,660 --> 03:55:00,940
And five days passed.

5661
03:55:02,020 --> 03:55:06,140
We left you on that- We left you in the ball pit for five days.

5662
03:55:07,560 --> 03:55:08,760
I'm sorry, Dad.

5663
03:55:10,040 --> 03:55:10,920
Oh, Os.

5664
03:55:11,920 --> 03:55:13,300
I'm the one who's sorry.

5665
03:55:14,020 --> 03:55:16,600
Things haven't been fair to you at all lately.

5666
03:55:17,120 --> 03:55:19,680
It's up to me and your mom to keep you happy.

5667
03:55:20,560 --> 03:55:25,560
I certainly haven't lived up to my end of the bargain ever since the mill closed.

5668
03:55:26,040 --> 03:55:26,520
So...

5669
03:55:27,400 --> 03:55:30,780
I think it's time your mom and I talked about moving somewhere better.

5670
03:55:31,040 --> 03:55:32,220
For all of us.

5671
03:55:32,400 --> 03:55:33,460
Even grandma.

5672
03:55:33,680 --> 03:55:34,780
But we can't afford it!

5673
03:55:35,480 --> 03:55:38,320
I just moved and it was a lot of money!

5674
03:55:38,680 --> 03:55:40,560
Like, how are we gonna afford it?

5675
03:55:40,700 --> 03:55:42,080
Who's gonna buy your house?

5676
03:55:42,260 --> 03:55:43,680
Nobody wants to live here!

5677
03:55:44,180 --> 03:55:48,500
Like- Obstructors, industrial groups- There's a great bubble wrap out there just for her.

5678
03:55:49,220 --> 03:55:49,740
Really?

5679
03:55:51,600 --> 03:55:52,120
Really.

5680
03:55:52,680 --> 03:55:54,620
Now let's get you patched up.

5681
03:55:55,520 --> 03:55:56,040
Dad!

5682
03:56:00,140 --> 03:56:04,060
By the way- By the way, I think I may be susp- What?

5683
03:56:04,720 --> 03:56:04,880
Dude!

5684
03:56:05,160 --> 03:56:05,680
What?

5685
03:56:06,060 --> 03:56:07,840
How did it fucking get suspended?

5686
03:56:10,580 --> 03:56:11,560
Yeah- Jeff?

5687
03:56:12,780 --> 03:56:14,660
There's like an- I got an achievement called...

5688
03:56:14,660 --> 03:56:15,380
Jeb?

5689
03:56:15,580 --> 03:56:16,620
We did it, guys!

5690
03:56:16,880 --> 03:56:18,340
We beat the world record!

5691
03:56:18,340 --> 03:56:19,720
For three hours!

5692
03:56:20,160 --> 03:56:22,720
Three minutes and fourteen seconds!

5693
03:56:24,920 --> 03:56:26,680
Oh, for punching the bully!

5694
03:56:27,420 --> 03:56:28,380
That's not a suspension!

5695
03:56:28,720 --> 03:56:29,720
That's just a detention!

5696
03:56:31,100 --> 03:56:31,540
Right?

5697
03:56:31,720 --> 03:56:33,380
I never got susp- Oh wait, no, I did.

5698
03:56:33,440 --> 03:56:36,960
I got suspended once in my life because I was late too often.

5699
03:56:39,440 --> 03:56:41,580
Is there an after credits scene, guys?

5700
03:56:43,120 --> 03:56:44,380
Flight, thank you for the super chat!

5701
03:56:44,420 --> 03:56:45,020
Thank you, thank you!

5702
03:56:45,040 --> 03:56:47,660
Imagine being outperforming in bed by seven foot tall.

5703
03:56:48,500 --> 03:56:50,540
Electronic, thank you for the super chat!

5704
03:56:50,580 --> 03:56:50,920
Thank you!

5705
03:56:51,000 --> 03:56:52,800
Guys, I did it, guys!

5706
03:56:53,100 --> 03:56:54,200
A world record!

5707
03:56:56,640 --> 03:56:59,940
Three hours, three minutes and fourteen seconds!

5708
03:56:59,980 --> 03:57:03,960
I love how- I love how there's a speed run timer there!

5709
03:57:04,180 --> 03:57:09,220
I think that's fucking hilarious that they put a speed run timer!

5710
03:57:11,040 --> 03:57:12,700
I got the two star ending?

5711
03:57:12,940 --> 03:57:14,080
How many stars?

5712
03:57:14,680 --> 03:57:15,380
How many?

5713
03:57:15,620 --> 03:57:17,500
What's the maximum stars you can get?

5714
03:57:17,500 --> 03:57:17,500
That's it.

5715
03:57:18,040 --> 03:57:19,480
There are two after-credits?

5716
03:57:19,540 --> 03:57:19,820
Okay.

5717
03:57:20,160 --> 03:57:22,240
Can I skip or do I have to wait until the end?

5718
03:57:22,860 --> 03:57:23,900
That was fun though!

5719
03:57:24,160 --> 03:57:26,500
I actually really enjoyed this game.

5720
03:57:26,840 --> 03:57:27,620
I thought the...

5721
03:57:27,620 --> 03:57:29,200
I thought... there's three?

5722
03:57:29,380 --> 03:57:30,480
How do you get the three-star?

5723
03:57:30,660 --> 03:57:31,720
Yeah, of course I'm gonna submit it.

5724
03:57:32,780 --> 03:57:33,660
Whenever it...

5725
03:57:34,300 --> 03:57:36,280
Wait, what's the third...

5726
03:57:36,280 --> 03:57:37,420
How do you get the third ending?

5727
03:57:39,820 --> 03:57:41,600
But you need to do... Oh, fuck no.

5728
03:57:41,600 --> 03:57:41,760
No.

5729
03:57:46,340 --> 03:57:48,500
I only lacked the three secret...

5730
03:57:48,500 --> 03:57:49,360
No, that's fine.

5731
03:57:49,660 --> 03:57:50,980
What's the third mini...

5732
03:57:50,980 --> 03:57:52,060
What's the third ending?

5733
03:57:53,400 --> 03:57:54,780
You play the arcade games?

5734
03:57:55,140 --> 03:57:56,460
Okay, yeah, no, that's fine.

5735
03:57:56,880 --> 03:57:57,660
That's fine.

5736
03:57:57,760 --> 03:57:59,880
I was fine with not playing the arcade games.

5737
03:57:59,980 --> 03:58:01,160
Yeah, I enjoyed it a lot!

5738
03:58:01,620 --> 03:58:03,280
I thought that was a really fun game.

5739
03:58:03,560 --> 03:58:05,360
I usually don't play these types of games, but...

5740
03:58:05,360 --> 03:58:08,120
I really did enjoy the gameplay of it.

5741
03:58:08,180 --> 03:58:10,060
It was actually scary at points too.

5742
03:58:10,260 --> 03:58:11,180
Like, it was very...

5743
03:58:11,600 --> 03:58:14,360
I had a lot of anxiety in some areas.

5744
03:58:14,760 --> 03:58:16,240
Yeah, unlock new music!

5745
03:58:16,320 --> 03:58:16,840
Jeff's Pizza!

5746
03:58:17,800 --> 03:58:18,440
Alright.

5747
03:58:18,880 --> 03:58:20,160
Is this after credits?

5748
03:58:21,340 --> 03:58:22,080
What's going on?

5749
03:58:23,120 --> 03:58:23,760
Jeff!

5750
03:58:24,820 --> 03:58:25,460
Huh?

5751
03:58:26,540 --> 03:58:28,860
That kid better not have gotten hurt in there.

5752
03:58:29,260 --> 03:58:30,480
No, Jeff!

5753
03:58:30,860 --> 03:58:31,780
Jeff, no!

5754
03:58:32,820 --> 03:58:33,900
Jeff, no!

5755
03:58:34,000 --> 03:58:34,700
There's blood!

5756
03:58:34,840 --> 03:58:35,180
Jeff!

5757
03:58:36,600 --> 03:58:37,240
Jeff!

5758
03:58:38,000 --> 03:58:38,640
Jeff!

5759
03:58:41,600 --> 03:58:41,940
I'm in solitaire!

5760
03:58:48,470 --> 03:58:49,070
Alright.

5761
03:58:50,850 --> 03:58:54,010
Well, it looks like Springtrap's gonna run another pizzeria.

5762
03:58:57,850 --> 03:59:02,070
Looks like Springtrap is gonna run Jeff's Pizza now.

5763
03:59:02,830 --> 03:59:05,070
Now he has to work in the pizzeria.

5764
03:59:05,770 --> 03:59:07,210
Well, that was fun though.

5765
03:59:07,610 --> 03:59:12,230
I can't believe inspecting items caused my frames to drop.

5766
03:59:12,370 --> 03:59:14,790
That has to be an in-game bug!

5767
03:59:14,790 --> 03:59:16,330
I'm like, there's no fucking way!

5768
03:59:16,630 --> 03:59:21,430
I can't believe inspecting, inspecting the fucking...

5769
03:59:22,910 --> 03:59:25,550
It was like, inspect the items, Doki.

5770
03:59:25,810 --> 03:59:26,830
What could go wrong?

5771
03:59:27,010 --> 03:59:29,230
And then it dropped to like 30 frames.

5772
03:59:30,790 --> 03:59:35,230
And then it fixed itself after we get into a cutscene.

5773
03:59:37,590 --> 03:59:40,870
And so, I'm like, why me?

5774
03:59:41,030 --> 03:59:42,750
Why is it always me?

5775
03:59:42,750 --> 03:59:46,770
I fucking bump into every gnome bug in any game I play.

5776
03:59:46,930 --> 03:59:47,890
It's actually Cree.

5777
03:59:47,950 --> 03:59:49,430
Like, it's a talent at this point.

5778
03:59:49,590 --> 03:59:50,990
It's a goddamn talent.

5779
03:59:52,750 --> 03:59:54,930
Oh my god, but that was really fun.

5780
03:59:55,230 --> 03:59:59,590
I definitely had a lot of fun with that game.

5781
04:00:00,770 --> 04:00:04,170
And um, I definitely enjoyed it a lot for sure.

5782
04:00:04,890 --> 04:00:12,030
It's definitely like a game that I normally don't play, but definitely had a great time playing it.

5783
04:00:13,510 --> 04:00:13,910
Um...

5784
04:00:14,410 --> 04:00:16,630
And I really did enjoy the gameplay a lot.

5785
04:00:16,710 --> 04:00:20,450
I get why people were saying like, oh yeah, this game was like really good for a FNAF game.

5786
04:00:21,030 --> 04:00:25,390
Because I don't know about you guys, but like the some of...

5787
04:00:26,050 --> 04:00:30,010
Not like... I heard the security breach is alright, but it's like buggy as hell too.

5788
04:00:30,190 --> 04:00:32,490
But like a lot of FNAF games are like very hit or miss.

5789
04:00:33,150 --> 04:00:35,010
But this one was pretty enjoyable.

5790
04:00:35,310 --> 04:00:37,030
Yeah, I really liked the story building.

5791
04:00:37,230 --> 04:00:39,210
I can't believe we couldn't find VTuber kid.

5792
04:00:39,390 --> 04:00:42,230
I have no way to fuck... God damn it!

5793
04:00:42,330 --> 04:00:42,710
God damn it!

5794
04:00:42,750 --> 04:00:45,510
And his Oh-She-kissed kept streaming, so I kept missing him!

5795
04:00:45,870 --> 04:00:46,810
Oh my God!

5796
04:00:48,030 --> 04:00:49,390
Cass, thank you for the superchat!

5797
04:00:49,450 --> 04:00:49,990
Thank you, thank you.

5798
04:00:50,610 --> 04:00:53,750
Um, it took you three hours to clear this game instead of three nights.

5799
04:00:53,790 --> 04:00:54,970
Your top five for sure.

5800
04:00:55,230 --> 04:00:55,590
Exactly!

5801
04:00:56,090 --> 04:00:56,810
Exactly guys!

5802
04:00:57,010 --> 04:00:59,530
It didn't take me five nights and five days to beat this.

5803
04:00:59,770 --> 04:01:00,130
Um.

5804
04:01:00,330 --> 04:01:01,710
But thank you for the superchat Cass.

5805
04:01:01,850 --> 04:01:02,410
Thank you, thank you.

5806
04:01:02,570 --> 04:01:03,430
Maybe am I right?

5807
04:01:03,470 --> 04:01:07,070
Like please, I want to look super cool in front of my chat that they'll let me in.

5808
04:01:07,290 --> 04:01:07,870
I hope!

5809
04:01:08,570 --> 04:01:10,530
I'll be like, please, I just...

5810
04:01:10,530 --> 04:01:12,730
Yeah, I just wanna look super cool!

5811
04:01:12,750 --> 04:01:14,070
It's cool in front of my chat.

5812
04:01:18,790 --> 04:01:20,490
Yeah, definitely a lot of fun.

5813
04:01:20,510 --> 04:01:21,990
I'm glad to be officially back.

5814
04:01:22,210 --> 04:01:26,710
No more delays, no more fucking disappearing because I have to move or everything.

5815
04:01:27,630 --> 04:01:30,090
I'm like one month behind on work, by the way.

5816
04:01:30,190 --> 04:01:32,170
I have so much stuff to catch up on.

5817
04:01:32,270 --> 04:01:37,430
But now I can finally catch up on everything because I'm sort of fully set up now.

5818
04:01:37,590 --> 04:01:38,250
I'm a new place.

5819
04:01:38,510 --> 04:01:39,530
I'm super happy.

5820
04:01:42,750 --> 04:01:43,510
I'm really, really happy.

5821
04:01:44,030 --> 04:01:45,250
Yeah, I'm one month behind.

5822
04:01:45,390 --> 04:01:48,050
So much shit was happening while I was dealing with this.

5823
04:01:48,990 --> 04:01:50,470
But it's okay now.

5824
04:01:50,570 --> 04:01:50,950
It's okay.

5825
04:01:51,130 --> 04:01:52,410
Everything is fine now.

5826
04:01:53,290 --> 04:02:00,010
But yes, sound guy, if you're still here, you gotta message me about what kind of...

5827
04:02:00,010 --> 04:02:05,470
I'm not gonna... guys, I'm not gonna keep the fucking plushies swoon around my room, guys.

5828
04:02:05,770 --> 04:02:08,990
No matter... it's not convenient at all.

5829
04:02:09,310 --> 04:02:12,730
I don't want my plushies to get dirty.

5830
04:02:12,750 --> 04:02:14,850
I don't want it to just surround the corners.

5831
04:02:16,370 --> 04:02:17,770
That's what I actually need.

5832
04:02:17,950 --> 04:02:23,350
I actually need, like, these... those foam thingies to, like, absorb the sound.

5833
04:02:26,130 --> 04:02:28,090
But it's not as...

5834
04:02:28,090 --> 04:02:30,550
For those who are like, what the fuck is she talking about?

5835
04:02:30,610 --> 04:02:34,710
This is like... this was what we were... because we were, like, super echoey.

5836
04:02:34,910 --> 04:02:38,370
This was our solution to, like, the mega echo.

5837
04:02:38,470 --> 04:02:40,250
I'll show you guys for those who are new here.

5838
04:02:40,250 --> 04:02:43,130
This was our solution to the mega echo.

5839
04:02:43,370 --> 04:02:44,070
Like...

5840
04:02:47,390 --> 04:02:50,170
This was... this was our solution.

5841
04:02:53,370 --> 04:02:57,530
We need the plushies to absorb the sound through.

5842
04:02:58,270 --> 04:02:59,550
And it worked.

5843
04:02:59,930 --> 04:03:03,750
I just threw plushies on the floor until they worked.

5844
04:03:03,830 --> 04:03:06,550
Until, like, it got less echoey.

5845
04:03:07,650 --> 04:03:11,690
So I need to...

5846
04:03:11,690 --> 04:03:12,130
Tomorrow...

5847
04:03:12,130 --> 04:03:14,730
It was solid.

5848
04:03:15,970 --> 04:03:16,490
Tomorrow...

5849
04:03:16,490 --> 04:03:20,710
I hate... I hate the glass door because I hate that he can just...

5850
04:03:20,710 --> 04:03:22,910
Dad's just out there looking at me.

5851
04:03:23,530 --> 04:03:25,250
It's so fucking weird.

5852
04:03:26,790 --> 04:03:28,730
I'm gonna get, like, blinds.

5853
04:03:29,490 --> 04:03:32,870
I'm gonna get blinds so he can't look inside.

5854
04:03:35,190 --> 04:03:36,690
Anyway, I'm gonna head off now.

5855
04:03:36,750 --> 04:03:38,570
I gotta make my schedule for this week.

5856
04:03:39,330 --> 04:03:41,050
So... but thank you everybody for coming.

5857
04:03:41,050 --> 04:03:43,930
Thank you for all the super chats and all the memberships.

5858
04:03:43,930 --> 04:03:45,470
I hope you guys had a great time watching.

5859
04:03:45,570 --> 04:03:47,270
As always, everybody, stay hydrated.

5860
04:03:47,850 --> 04:03:48,350
Posture check.

5861
04:03:48,370 --> 04:03:49,950
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

5862
04:03:50,090 --> 04:03:52,050
And if you stood up for me, head to bed.

5863
04:03:52,150 --> 04:03:53,350
Because you deserve it.

5864
04:03:53,450 --> 04:03:54,350
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

5865
04:03:54,790 --> 04:03:55,470
Bye, guys.

5866
04:03:56,110 --> 04:03:56,470
Bye.
