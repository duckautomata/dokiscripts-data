00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:53,240

Like, fuck you!

6
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:14,520
What is wrong with you?

7
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:22,140
Alright, so basically, I was like, I didn't realize...

8
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:30,420
like i've been in tutorial for like two hours now because i
was scared and then i was like asking chat i was like okay

9
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:38,140
guys because like when i got in it was like oh server is at
capacity um please try again later so like you know i've

10
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:43,180
never played hell divers before by the way never play hell
divers one i've never fucking tried out hell divers two

11
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:50,760
because i was like okay if i'm gonna play hell divers i want
to play it um on stream for the first time with you guys

12
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,340
because Like I had friends being like, yes, you want to play
hill divers?

13
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:56,820
I was like, no, I'm going to do this for my dragoons.

14
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:00,380
But then everyone was like, good luck getting in.

15
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,740
I was like, wait, what do you mean?

16
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,680
Good luck getting in.

17
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,480
So then I was like asking my chat.

18
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,800
Also, mom, thank you for the macheta soup.

19
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:15,280
Thank you.

20
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:15,720
Thank you.

21
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,160
Anyway, I apologize.

22
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:19,360
I'm a wizard.

23
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:20,720
Thank you for the soup chat.

24
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:21,620
Thank you.

25
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:26,960
Anyway, so I was like asking in my chat, I was like, hey,
guys.

26
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,300
So like, I'm in the tutorial.

27
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:31,780
Does this count?

28
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:37,800
And then so like, obviously, the first two people were like,
yeah, if you're in the tutorial right now, that means you're

29
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,800
in the server.

30
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:40,040
So I was like, sweet.

31
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:47,480
And then right after that, one guy, I swear, if that one guy
was correct, they're like, no, you're not in the server.

32
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,980
And I was like, oh.

33
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:57,580
And so I was just like, oh, no, wait a minute.

34
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:03,060
And then so then I was like, guys, please, I need to know.

35
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:08,220
Because like, being in a tutorial doesn't mean being in the
game.

36
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:10,100
Then we are so fucked.

37
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:15,340
Because like I could just finish the tutorial right down
before the stream.

38
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:18,560
So then people, one person was like, no, you're okay.

39
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:19,680
You're in the game.

40
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,400
And I wrote, like, nice.

41
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,920
And at the moment I wrote, nice.

42
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:27,720
One other guy was like, no, you're not.

43
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:36,140
So I was just like, okay, well, we're going to do it.

44
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,000
I swear to God, I feel like I'm going to crash.

45
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:42,120
Because, like, people were like, people were like, oh, yeah.

46
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,560
I mean, you could be in.

47
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:46,380
But, like, that doesn't stop you from crashing.

48
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:48,120
And I was like, wait.

49
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:59,680
me it doesn't stop you from oh no because apparently when
you crash obviously you'll have to go back in there again so

50
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:06,480
like i'm just like please please just at least at least let
me finish the tutorial also emilia thank you for the akasupa

This is where all your tax dollars go to.

66
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:02,740
Honestly, I'm glad this is where all my tax dollars are
going to.

00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:16,740
Alright.

How's the volume, by the way?

84
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:17,690
Grab a stim?

85
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:18,850
Where's the sim?

00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:22,290
Oh, in front of me.

00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:23,730
Okay, V.

00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:25,750
Alright, nice.

89
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:28,190
Yeah, that wasn't me.

90
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:29,310
That was a different player.

91
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:35,560
You miss a bit load?

92
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:37,860
Okay, let me fix the volume real fast.

93
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:39,620
Boop.

94
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:40,780
I'll boost it up.

95
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,420
I don't know if Sound Guy's here today.

96
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,180
Let me, yeah, Sound Guy's not here.

97
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,080
I don't know actually if Sound Guy's here today.

98
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,040
Imagine that.

99
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:50,340
Oh, yes, if you didn't fucking run.

100
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,280
Everybody runs.

101
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,700
Oh my God.

102
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:55,260
No.

103
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:55,860
Okay.

104
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,300
Give me a sec.

105
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:59,020
Okay, give me a sec.

106
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,880
This is way too low to sense.

107
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:01,900
All right.

108
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,140
Mouse sensitivity.

109
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:06,580
I don't... Okay, mouse scope set.

110
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,520
Okay, mouse... Why is it on 10!

111
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:12,400
Okay, mouse aim should definitely not be on 10.

112
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,840
Let me fix that real fast.

113
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:16,400
Okay, let me...

114
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,540
No, that's way too high.

115
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:23,460
The best part about being a gamer is that you're super anal
about...

116
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:27,960
You're super fucking anal when it comes to... We're gonna...

117
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,800
Oh, I have no bullets.

118
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:30,200
When it comes to sensitivity.

119
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,840
Step 1, grab a fistful of freedom.

120
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:34,900
Send the swarm something warm.

121
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:37,280
Step 2, penetrate and detonate.

122
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,700
Maximum some death for maximum damage.

123
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,060
Terminate the... Terminate the...

124
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:44,240
Termin... Headshot.

125
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:45,980
Nice.

126
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,760
More cheese, man.

127
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,060
Thank you for the Akasufa.

128
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:50,400
Thank you.

129
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:51,080
Thank you.

130
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:54,340
Alright.

131
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,200
Is that it?

132
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,820
Where are the ones that keep coming?

133
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:00,160
Oh, pick up the grenades!

134
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,120
Okay, sorry.

135
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,800
I keep forgetting that I can't read.

136
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:03,980
How do I throw?

137
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:05,440
G to throw a grenade.

138
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:07,040
Where do I throw?

139
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:07,860
In there?

140
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:10,320
Boop.

141
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:13,280
Nice.

142
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,240
Super destroyer.

143
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:26,040
Use a stratagem.

144
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:31,720
Just make sure you take a few steps back.

145
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,400
How do I do this?

146
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:34,700
Orbital.

147
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,140
W-A-S-D-2.

148
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:38,780
Oh!

149
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:42,480
Activating.

150
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:43,440
I'm doing it!

151
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:47,360
Where is it?

152
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:48,820
Oh, throw it!

153
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,440
I'm doing it!

154
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:54,500
For real this time!

155
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:01,220
Sorry, I keep forgetting to read.

156
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,360
Okay, now I got it.

157
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,580
It's okay, I'm doing it now.

158
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,240
I'm reading it.

159
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,560
I'm learning how to read, guys.

160
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:15,900
Look, you normally don't have to read in other FPS games.

161
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:18,680
Reading is a little hard.

162
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,280
How's the sound now?

163
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:20,840
Is it better?

164
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:23,300
Nice.

165
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:33,820
Yeah, it's just friends.

166
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:34,640
Yeah, see?

167
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,260
It's like, it's just life.

168
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:40,960
Use the reinforcement strategy to replace your fallen
comrades.

169
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:42,540
Voices a bit low?

170
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:43,940
Okay, don't worry, I got you guys.

171
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:46,680
Alright, that should be better.

172
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:49,140
Alright, control the whole strat again?

173
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,680
Oh, okay.

174
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:54,300
Activating, throw the stratage and ball.

175
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:55,420
That's right here.

176
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:56,720

Watch.

189
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:01,180
Middle mouse for first person?

190
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:05,680
It's not activating first.

191
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,860
I think you have to get out of tutorial first.

192
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,800
To activate first person.

193
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:12,340
Don't reload.

194
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:12,920
Oh, wait.

195
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,540

196
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:16,140

197
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:17,340
Really?

198
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,420
That's so dumb.

199
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,200
I'm so used to reloading all the time.

200
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,220
I just activated here.

201
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:34,640
Oh, oh, oh, why would I ever...

202
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,480
I'm just gonna fortnight this.

203
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:39,380
I don't think I would...

204
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:41,540
This is actually disgusting.

205
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:42,400
I'm sorry.

206
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,460
This actually...

207
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,180
It looks fucking terrible.

208
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:51,980
It's not for me.

209
00:14:56,810 --> 00:14:57,990
Hold the reload button.

210
00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:00,770

211
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:02,450

00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:38,230
I can just aim in third person because I'm not stupid.

226
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:47,890

227
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:55,330
Okay, maybe if I'm sniping, I'll do this.

228

00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:11,970
Wait, is that it?

231
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:12,710

00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:15,470

You may cast your vote many times.

272
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:05,600
Alright.

273
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:06,860
Once on election day.

274
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:11,580
And another with every bullet buried in an enemy combatant.

275
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:12,980
Alright.

276
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,940
Where do I go?

277
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,340
Welcome to the Galactic War.

278
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:20,040
Here the community fights together against its common enemy.

279
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:23,380
The path to the barrier of planets is clear.

280
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:24,120
Upon each of them.

281
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:32,500
Faria planet engineers have begun construction of the term
Terminant control system a network of massive towers that

282
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:40,140
will cover each planet in the well-tested Neurotoxins known
as termicide soon our citizens will be able to rest easy

283
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:47,720
knowing their children Are safe from the flares of being
eaten alive but like are we the but did they live on the

284
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:54,820
planet First or did we live on the planet first doesn't
matter because they're the bad guys because They're not

285
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:56,160
about democracy.

286
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:57,860
Was that, is that it?

287
00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:59,720
Am I, am I fitting in?

288
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:00,040
Am I?

289
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:07,220
Doesn't matter.

290
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:10,220
Because they're not about freedom and democracy.

291
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:13,160
We deserve that planet.

292
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:21,520
Hovering over a sector shows you how much of its super earth
has already been liberated.

293
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:23,000
Do not worry.

294
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,120
We will liberate you.

295
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:34,480
All operations contribute to pushing the enemies of Super
Earth back.

296
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:38,860
Select a sector to see what planets are currently playable.

297
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:39,460
All right.

298
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,420
Is this...

299
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:43,380
All right.

300
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:46,640
So this is...

301
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,720
This is our planet.

302
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,880
So I guess we just go here, right?

303
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:54,120
Depending on the war...

304
00:22:54,140 --> 00:23:02,280

To deliver freedom!

309
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:32,120
They definitely do not want me as a teammate, but it's too
bad.

310
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:33,660
Shots fire.

311
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:36,080
I... Oh, hey guys, I'm level one.

312
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,820
I'm just a little baby.

313
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:51,380
Do not worry!

314
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:59,340

anyway.

I'm still figuring this out.

322
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,020
All right.

323
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:13,840

We can spread democracy We can get carried

335
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:28,640
That's all that matters.

336
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:32,200

00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:36,600

00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:53,760
I want to be like, what are you watching?

523
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:56,300
Yes.

524
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:01,500
Wait, what is a super...

525
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:02,760
What is a super citizen?

526
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:09,560
Well, I get, like, DMCA'd by this one guy watching on his
TV.

527
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:16,580
The one guy that's...

528
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:21,320
It's like, Scrubs has DMCA'd you, my friend.

529
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:24,300
Yeah, you can see his TV.

530
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:27,720
I'd look at him like this, dude.

531
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:29,720
This literally is just Starship's reverse.

532
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:31,100
Oh, my God.

533
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:31,880
Look at him.

534
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:32,960
The PODSD.

535
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,680
He's a PS5 gamer.

536
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:37,240
Which one?

537
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:42,980
The, the, the, I like how the, um, DMC by someone's voice.

538
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:43,460
Yeah.

539
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:46,540
Your left bumper and call in your machine gun.

540
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:47,220
Oh my God.

541
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,460
He is on controller.

542
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:50,140
All right.

543
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:50,760
Don't worry.

544
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:51,320
I know.

545
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:52,600
how to do this, too.

546
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:55,460
There you go.

547
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:58,320
I'm learning!

548
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:02,240
Where's my thing?

549
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,000
Oh, there he is.

550
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:06,380
Nice.

551
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:07,600
I got my stuff.

552
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:09,940
Can I steal his shit?

553
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,140
Alright, nice.

554
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:15,960
Look at the little baby!

555
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:16,820
Oh my god!

556
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:22,560
He's like a dad teaching his teenager's teenage son how to
play the game.

557
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:25,720
Wait, what's my mission?

558
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:27,880
I was not paying attention.

559
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:36,560
What if she was open, Mike?

560
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:37,240
No, I'm not.

561
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:39,960
I made sure I was not open, Mike.

562
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:41,260
Wait, where's our super citizen?

563
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:43,040
Who is our super citizen?

564
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:43,760
C3, right?

565
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:45,880
Oh my god, look at them.

566
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:46,380
Go.

567
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:48,940
Bug breach detected.

568
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:52,140
Don't worry, the babies will Stay in the back.

569
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:54,320
Go, Dads.

570
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:54,520
Go!

571
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:55,560
Oh, shit.

572
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:57,000
I thought someone hit me.

573
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:58,600
Oh, that's really all the eggs are.

574
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:00,180
Don't worry.

575
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:05,160
The babies will be here in the back line.

576
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:06,180
Oh, there's babies.

577
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:08,220
There's babies in the back, too.

578
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:11,020
Don't worry.

579
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:11,700
I got it.

580
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:13,740
I don't want to say...

581
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:14,240
Oh, fuck.

582
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:15,580
Oh, my God.

583
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:16,080
I'm getting raped.

584
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:20,040
Oh, my God.

585
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:20,060
No!

586
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:22,020

587
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,220

588
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:26,160
Oh, no!

589
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:31,320
When your friends die, you have to call them back in with
the stratagem.

590
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:33,600
No!

591
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:42,480
Okay, please don't let him get me!

592
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:45,080
Please don't let him get me!

593
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:46,340
And then fucking...

594
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:50,840
Heal teammates, I'm not fucking healing jack shit.

595
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:54,420

596
00:41:54,620 --> 00:41:59,520

00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,340
We did it!

599
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:12,620
Now I realize why we normally don't do open vc, like why we
don't go into voice chat.

600
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:14,660
It's so hard to like listen to my glass and do this.

601
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:15,560
Not.

602
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:41,500
He's like, bro, it's so hard to play right now while

It wasn't even TV!

608
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:04,000
He's literally playing video games while in class!

609
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:05,360
It's good to just take out all these outposts and stuff.

610
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:07,720
That's it.

611
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:10,000

00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:24,160

619
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:37,180

620
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:38,800
Take your notes.

00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:44,620

00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:50,460
You don't have to pay tuition.

625
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:53,480
You can literally learn everything from my stream.

626
00:43:56,660 --> 00:43:59,000

627
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:07,100
Doki, are there gonna be a quiz on this later?

00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:37,880
Because you guys were able to listen to his class, right?

I'm pretty sure it was all right.

809
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:47,660
Because you guys could actually learn from his class.

810
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:50,020

815
00:56:59,860 --> 00:57:00,540

You're like, Doki, why did you leave this team?

819
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:13,460
We could have learned so much.

820
00:57:13,860 --> 00:57:15,680
We could have had another lecture.

821
00:57:16,220 --> 00:57:18,340
There's nothing in medium, guys.

822
00:57:20,060 --> 00:57:22,840

827
00:57:55,920 --> 00:58:00,840
So, like, instead of having going to school, we can, like,
we can leech off of their education.

828
00:58:02,040 --> 00:58:03,900
Taurus, think about five gifts and chips.

I don't need ammo, guys.

894
01:02:16,980 --> 01:02:17,840

Okay, is there anything else to loot?

1058
01:11:03,870 --> 01:11:07,510

art.

1059
01:11:07,530 --> 01:11:07,950

Just sniped them from all the way here.

1079
01:12:46,160 --> 01:12:47,840
Flexing his level, I guess.

01:12:48,820 --> 01:12:49,580
It was nice, though.

1081
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:50,620

I guess to, like, upgrade your chip and everything, right?

1087
01:13:08,080 --> 01:13:09,400
Helping newbies, I guess.

Is that possible?

1097
01:13:37,580 --> 01:13:40,520
We're super, like, a true super citizen.

1098
01:13:41,040 --> 01:13:42,900
Babies, we did it!

1099
01:13:44,960 --> 01:13:47,020

01:13:56,060 --> 01:13:58,780
We fucking did it, babies.

1102
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:02,800
We don't need a babysitter.

1103
01:14:03,440 --> 01:14:05,920
We are the babysitter.

1104
01:14:07,080 --> 01:14:08,740
Look at us, girl.

1105
01:14:09,700 --> 01:14:11,020

1106
01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:12,760
optional objective.

1107
01:14:18,650 --> 01:14:20,790
You can also have freedom without doom.

1108
01:14:21,490 --> 01:14:22,010
Can we do that?

1109
01:14:22,170 --> 01:14:22,970
Oh, we didn't do that.

1110
01:14:23,090 --> 01:14:24,270
I didn't know how to do that.

1111
01:14:25,070 --> 01:14:25,430
Nice.

1112
01:14:27,990 --> 01:14:30,590
We had to multitask with class.

1113
01:14:32,470 --> 01:14:32,930
Whoa!

1114
01:14:33,130 --> 01:14:33,890

01:14:39,450 --> 01:14:42,130

01:14:42,310 --> 01:14:44,070
He gets the level up and I can!

1119
01:14:44,230 --> 01:14:46,070
What did he do?

1120
01:14:49,070 --> 01:14:50,890
The squad impact.

1121
01:14:51,230 --> 01:14:51,490
Zero?

1122
01:14:51,790 --> 01:14:53,550
Wait, was it fully liberated already?

1123
01:14:54,270 --> 01:14:59,990
Have we colonized the planet and rid of the anti-freedom
monsters?

1124
01:15:04,950 --> 01:15:07,810
He did more democracy.

1125
01:15:10,990 --> 01:15:13,610
Oh, it's not liberated.

1126
01:15:13,910 --> 01:15:14,650
Liberated?

1127
01:15:15,210 --> 01:15:16,290

01:29:58,260 --> 01:29:58,820
We're good.

1413
01:30:00,760 --> 01:30:01,960
We're not good.

1414
01:30:02,700 --> 01:30:03,360
We're not good.

1415
01:30:03,820 --> 01:30:04,740

You're the highest level.

01:30:16,850 --> 01:30:18,330
There's the main objective.

1422
01:30:18,850 --> 01:30:19,830
So we gotta launch a nuke.

1423
01:30:20,670 --> 01:30:21,810
S4 lead us.

1424
01:30:22,870 --> 01:30:26,750

01:33:58,830 --> 01:33:59,890
That's how you're right.

1475
01:34:00,430 --> 01:34:02,510
That's where you know what's good for you.

1476
01:34:06,410 --> 01:34:07,850
There we go.

1477
01:34:11,750 --> 01:34:15,230
Oh, it's so unlucky that there was some friendly fire there.

1478
01:34:16,050 --> 01:34:18,010
That was, that was so unlucky.

1479
01:34:18,310 --> 01:34:18,830

Okay, nice.

Nice.

We're doing it!

1488
01:34:31,550 --> 01:34:33,230
Let me do it.

1489
01:34:33,670 --> 01:34:35,930
We don't need to bring them back.

1490
01:34:36,150 --> 01:34:38,090
S4 and I, we're gamers.

1491
01:34:39,150 --> 01:34:43,550
Doki never forgets, Doki never forgets.

1492
01:34:47,450 --> 01:34:48,810
Alright, here we go.

1493
01:34:50,350 --> 01:34:50,950
We're good.

1494
01:34:51,550 --> 01:34:52,550
What are you mean?

1495
01:34:53,370 --> 01:34:55,250
Wait, he struck first!

1496
01:34:55,950 --> 01:34:57,330
I was just...

1497
01:34:57,330 --> 01:34:59,090
Look, he hit me first!

1498
01:34:59,790 --> 01:35:01,770
Guys, this was self-defense.

1499
01:35:02,450 --> 01:35:04,110
This was self-defense, guys.

1500
01:35:05,930 --> 01:35:07,070
Oh no.

1501
01:35:07,670 --> 01:35:08,710
Oh no.

1502
01:35:10,310 --> 01:35:12,490
This was self-defense, guys.

1503
01:35:13,750 --> 01:35:15,630
I was all about self-defending.

1504
01:35:17,050 --> 01:35:19,190
It's okay, S4 can carry us.

1505
01:35:20,190 --> 01:35:22,930
You ran in front of them, though.

1506
01:35:26,270 --> 01:35:28,390
Self-defense three times?

1507
01:35:28,810 --> 01:35:29,210
Yeah!

1508
01:35:30,050 --> 01:35:31,130
What are you trying to say?

1509
01:35:33,950 --> 01:35:34,670
Nice.

1512
01:35:39,150 --> 01:35:40,050
What do you mean?

1513
01:35:40,690 --> 01:35:42,510

Die for me.

He survived.

1540
01:38:21,720 --> 01:38:27,100
God bless you as for you selfless soul.

1541
01:38:29,140 --> 01:38:31,420
Loyal to the end.

1542
01:38:32,220 --> 01:38:34,860
A true freedom enthusiast.

1543
01:38:35,640 --> 01:38:40,320
Now we know who's really there for freedom.

01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:11,460
Okay, the robots are scary.

01:40:11,860 --> 01:40:12,580
Not gonna lie.

1579
01:40:12,800 --> 01:40:19,220
The robots are actually pretty scary.

1580
01:40:19,820 --> 01:40:20,400
I don't know.

1581
01:40:20,520 --> 01:40:23,440
I don't know if I want to keep playing, keep doing the
robots.

1582
01:40:25,500 --> 01:40:28,360

I'm sorry.

1687
01:48:17,920 --> 01:48:20,860
Democracy doesn't wait for callbacks.

1688
01:48:21,700 --> 01:48:23,560
Leave them alone, Doki.

1689
01:48:24,200 --> 01:48:24,660

1690
01:48:24,760 --> 01:48:26,480

Take over leadership.

1696
01:48:37,400 --> 01:48:39,300
I've got to go AFK for four minutes.

1697
01:48:59,240 --> 01:48:59,520

01:48:59,620 --> 01:48:59,660

Oh, shit.

1701
01:49:03,960 --> 01:49:04,260
Bro.

1702
01:49:05,240 --> 01:49:05,700

Here we go.

01:49:17,640 --> 01:49:19,220
I can't believe it!

1706
01:49:20,760 --> 01:49:25,200
I can't believe I was the third wheel this entire time!

1707
01:49:26,180 --> 01:49:27,640
I was a joke!

1708
01:49:27,780 --> 01:49:30,100
You ruined freedom day!

1709
01:49:34,260 --> 01:49:37,480
We need you to come back from your toilet break!

1710
01:49:38,360 --> 01:49:40,480
He can't lead us!

1711
01:49:43,860 --> 01:49:45,100
Oh my god.

1712
01:49:47,700 --> 01:49:49,060
Oh my god.

1713
01:49:49,300 --> 01:49:49,660
Axeman!

1714

Hi, Doki.

1718
01:49:52,640 --> 01:49:53,960
I was a traitor who killed you.

1719
01:49:54,280 --> 01:49:57,540
Have fun spreading managed democracy into the galaxy.

1720
01:49:57,960 --> 01:49:58,600
Don't worry.

1721
01:49:58,760 --> 01:50:01,460
I'm already ruining the date right now.

1722
01:50:02,080 --> 01:50:03,820
Everything's going great.

1723
01:50:05,540 --> 01:50:08,000
It's everything I've always wanted.

1724
01:50:09,760 --> 01:50:12,600
He's not crying in the bathtub.

1725
01:50:17,800 --> 01:50:18,860
There you go.

1726
01:50:20,520 --> 01:50:21,140
Can we do this?

1727
01:50:24,380 --> 01:50:25,560
I can't believe it.

1728
01:50:25,920 --> 01:50:29,060
He even, like, gave leadership to his date.

1729
01:50:29,480 --> 01:50:30,260
What's this?

1730
01:50:30,840 --> 01:50:31,940
Screen is frozen.

1731
01:50:34,920 --> 01:50:36,080
Oh, shit, there's babies.

1732
01:50:37,820 --> 01:50:38,400

1733
01:50:38,400 --> 01:50:40,100

1734
01:50:40,120 --> 01:50:40,940
KFK.

1735
01:50:45,300 --> 01:50:46,480
Alright, you know what?

1736
01:50:46,780 --> 01:50:47,020
Fuck this.

1737
01:50:47,160 --> 01:50:48,000
I'm just gonna...

1738
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:48,240
Bye.

1739
01:50:49,720 --> 01:50:51,680
I'm just gonna kill these guys.

1740
01:50:55,280 --> 01:50:56,700
No one close to us, right?

1741
01:50:58,120 --> 01:50:58,580
Nice.

1742
01:50:58,680 --> 01:50:58,980
We're fine.

1743
01:50:59,120 --> 01:50:59,520
We're fine.

1744
01:51:02,060 --> 01:51:02,440
Oh.

1745
01:51:03,460 --> 01:51:04,160
Get out!

1746
01:51:04,180 --> 01:51:04,520
Get out!

1747
01:51:04,580 --> 01:51:05,860
Your laser is too slow!

1748
01:51:06,640 --> 01:51:07,780
I'm just gonna...

1749
01:51:07,780 --> 01:51:10,400
I should kill him before.

1750
01:51:11,040 --> 01:51:11,500
Please!

1751
01:51:11,680 --> 01:51:13,020

1752
01:51:19,080 --> 01:51:21,020

Fine.

1754
01:51:22,680 --> 01:51:24,280
I'll heal myself.

1755
01:51:25,380 --> 01:51:25,860
Fine.

1756
01:51:29,160 --> 01:51:30,100
Activate terminal.

1757
01:51:30,720 --> 01:51:31,700
Do we activate it yet?

1758
01:51:32,820 --> 01:51:33,660
Did you do it?

1759
01:51:33,700 --> 01:51:34,260

I'm giving them the freedom experience.

1789
01:54:45,990 --> 01:54:47,470
Public is freedom.

1790
01:54:49,890 --> 01:54:54,450

lobby

02:08:13,640 --> 02:08:15,000
We're almost there.

1945
02:08:16,340 --> 02:08:17,400
Extraction is so far.

1946
02:08:18,820 --> 02:08:20,720
The baby bounced off the hill.

1947
02:08:21,280 --> 02:08:21,280

Thank you.

1956
02:08:35,860 --> 02:08:38,380
I made the break up.

1957
02:08:38,760 --> 02:08:45,080
Look, if I was the one that broke their marriage, then maybe
they were never compatible in the first place, okay?

1958
02:08:45,680 --> 02:08:47,940
I am not the main reason.

1959
02:08:48,160 --> 02:08:49,860
I was the breaking point.

1960
02:08:54,370 --> 02:08:55,650
Do I want to do it?

1961
02:08:57,950 --> 02:08:58,430
Good.

1962
02:09:00,930 --> 02:09:02,610
Yes, but also.

1963
02:09:05,350 --> 02:09:08,150
I was like the one that pushed them off the edge.

1964
02:09:08,470 --> 02:09:11,550
But it doesn't mean that I was the...

1965
02:09:11,570 --> 02:09:13,570
Soul cause of this

1966
02:09:17,170 --> 02:09:22,050
Why do you sound proud of that I didn't say I was proud of
it.

1967
02:09:22,210 --> 02:09:26,950
I'm just saying it's not my fault that they broke up

1968
02:09:30,810 --> 02:09:33,390
I was just there

And so, those are the rules.

2050
02:17:45,620 --> 02:17:46,780
And, but there were already people.

2051
02:17:47,340 --> 02:17:48,040
It's so funny.

2052
02:17:48,080 --> 02:17:50,560
I was looking at the Discord and I was, like, reading the
rules.

2053
02:17:50,980 --> 02:17:55,660
And there were already people that were, like, can we, like,
can we exploit?

2054
02:17:57,660 --> 02:18:02,180
Can we exploit and do, like, speedrun strats and stuff like
that?

2055
02:18:02,520 --> 02:18:06,640
And it was so funny because the staff was like, no, no, no.

2056
02:18:07,260 --> 02:18:11,600
No, no, no, because they're like, can we do this speed run
track?

2057
02:18:11,820 --> 02:18:13,480
Can we do that speed run track?

2058
02:18:13,640 --> 02:18:14,920
Can we do this exploit?

2059
02:18:15,080 --> 02:18:18,740
And then Sam's just like, no, no, no, no, no.

2060
02:18:19,060 --> 02:18:20,800
And I thought it was so fun.

2061
02:18:20,960 --> 02:18:22,040
I'm like, what the fuck?

2062
02:18:22,180 --> 02:18:25,220
People are already, like, training for this.

2063
02:18:25,300 --> 02:18:28,240

It's so competitive.

2068
02:18:40,760 --> 02:18:47,980
I didn't realize how competitive it's gonna be because it's
like it's just like an achievement run.

2069
02:18:48,300 --> 02:18:56,760
Um but yeah they're like fucking brainstorming like speed
run strats right now in the power world like twitch rivals
