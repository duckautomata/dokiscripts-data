1
00:01:54,520 --> 00:02:04,640
Oh my god, I'm so sorry Oh, we crash, we crash We're just
gonna have If we crash, we crash If we have crashes every 15

2
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:14,440
minutes That's just the way of life It's the Doki life Doki
Brit has never been lucky I work very hard But sometimes

3
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:24,440
life just goes Fuck you Never been lucky in life I've
accepted it.

4
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:28,540
I basically, what I, I basically remade everything.

5
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,360
I had to remake everything.

6
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:33,140
I even deleted my old scene collection.

7
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:36,000
I deleted my fucking normal streaming collection.

8
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,980
Like, so, cause I was just like, oh no, what's going on?

9
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:46,120
Cause it always, it does, I don't know, it does happen very
off, like not very often, but it's like random.

10
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,700
If I make a new scene collection, sometimes it works and
sometimes it doesn't.

11
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:52,060
But it hits at like the most random moments.

12
00:02:52,340 --> 00:03:01,020
when it hits it crashes every 15 minutes like obs in general
it crashes every 15 minutes so like it's so hard to like

13
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:06,740
sometimes predict when it's gonna happen and then like while
i was standing up it didn't hit until like when i was about

14
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:12,560
to start the stream and then when it hit i was like oh fuck
okay i'm gonna try to do the fast way because usually the

15
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:19,220
fast way is like a 50 50 chance for it to work so that was
like okay i'm gonna do it the fast way maybe the fast way

16
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:26,800
will be fine and then obviously we had to wait 15 minutes
and then i was like oh it did not work the fast way did not

17
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:39,680
work so i guess i'll just do the slow way but the slow way
isn't guarantee either it just has a higher percentage of

18
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:50,480
guaranteeing anyway to be fair to be fair what i'm
announcing oh my gosh there's so much work that went into

19
00:03:50,480 --> 00:04:02,700
this i'm just i i don't know i hope i got everything i hope
like i got everything in because like i had to set up really

20
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:10,160
really fucking fast so like i don't even know if i set
everything up properly i don't i was just like okay

21
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:14,980
everything looks i think everything's in And then I just
went, oh, fuck it, we bawled.

22
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:17,640
We fucking bawled.

23
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:21,440
Guys, I swear, I'm going to set my new PC today or tomorrow.

24
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:23,360
It's just there's so many things going on.

25
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:25,500
So I didn't have time to do anything.

26
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:29,800
What's happening?

27
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:32,520
That's a very good question.

28
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:38,820
I bet you guys are all very, very curious as to what this
announcement's going to be.

29
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,800
I mean, of course, it could be anything.

30
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:49,020
answers only and i saw a lot of people giving so many
different answers you someone actually got it right someone

31
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:58,080
was like wrong answer but then it was actually the right
answer so it's fucking crazy why do you guys actually got

32
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:06,900
the answer correct while we were giving wrong answer only so
it was very interesting to see hey guys all right i mean i

33
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:12,040
could like bait you guys longer I could like make you guys
wait even longer, but we you guys already waited 36 minutes.

34
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,640
So Let's do a countdown.

35
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,520
Let's get a drum roll, please.

36
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,480
Drum roll everybody.

37
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:23,160
10, 9, 8, 7.

38
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,080
It'll be so funny if I crash this moment.

39
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,620
Knowing me, this, I fucking can jinx myself.

40
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:36,820
8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

41
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,160
Oh,

42
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,800
yes, everybody!

43
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:45,140
WrestleTuber is here!

44
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:46,820
Yeah!

45
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:51,170
No, I didn't mute my mic.

46
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:53,610
I just let you guys enjoy the moment, you know?

47
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:58,110
Just like absorb the moment as you see the logo.

48
00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:04,570
So you might be noticing something in the backdrop that's
different other than just the WrestleTuber logo.

49
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:08,450
But this whole event will be sponsored.

50
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:21,490
by gamer subs in a way where basically i didn't have to pay
for anything so so a huge shout out to gamer subs for

51
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:32,110
providing the funding for the graphics um uh for the uh for
the wrestling belts like you hear the plural belts and other

52
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:45,490
goodies so gamer subs is the official sponsor for wrestle um
some of you guys might be wondering what is wrestle tuber um

53
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:50,570
but before i answer that i just need you guys to know
there's so many like last minute things that happened uh

54
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:57,770
before this announcement that like i literally was like
scrounging up the last couple of details like two hours

55
00:07:57,770 --> 00:08:06,870
before this stream was supposed to air because like there
was some last minute additions and there was also um there

56
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:13,970
was also like some uh we were actually was gonna have a
video to like show it and stuff just like the uh the logo

57
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:22,850
but because there's so many last minute additions a video
was not made in time and i hope the video editor is okay

58
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:34,030
because i was like i'm so sorry we have some last minute
additions to be made and because of that uh the the the

59
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:41,910
videos video was not done in time but it was it's it's a
really sick video so when it is done i cannot wait to show

it is honestly one of the hardest fucking event i've ever

63
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:15,550
organized ever because there's so many people from different
backgrounds different companies either company or indie and

64
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:25,270
like trying to coordinate with so many different people um
and then like trying to grab information and grabbing um and

65
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:34,810

I really need the information

75
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:31,950
I swear this is absolutely one of the hardest events I've
ever organized only because because there's just so many

76
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:38,430
different people from different backgrounds and trying to
grab information, trying to grab intel, like trying to try

77
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:42,590
to grab graphics, trying to court scheduling too.

78
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:48,630
Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry if you don't see some of your like
Yoshi, if you don't see your Yoshi or your content creator,

79
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:53,210
like a content creator you actually really wanted to see in
WrestleTuber, um, that's not there.

80
00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:56,170
Scheduling was so fucking hard.

81
00:10:56,350 --> 00:11:06,490
And I also had to cap it too, that cap it at one point and
then I had and then like we had like uh maybe like one or

82
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:11,690
two people dropped out because the scheduling wise for
everybody was different and because of that because there's

83
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:17,910
like I said it's different companies or like indies and then
everybody has different scheduling and then there's like

84
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:26,330
conventions going on there's like other stuff going on
within that company so because of that um because of that we

85
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:32,630
had like moments where like maybe like somebody dropped out
and then because like the skit we had to change the dates

86
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:44,670
for the event uh and all oh my gosh it was a lot i need you
guys to know this is fully organized and prepared by me only

87
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:52,970
there's no team behind it despite gamer subs is sponsoring
this i've organized all of this myself like every

88
00:11:52,970 --> 00:12:06,550
information setting up the discord server to people all of
this was done by me and me only so i like i didn't want to

89
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:17,230
make this like an like a super serious i didn't want to make
this like a super serious like uh uh like very official uh

90
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:28,830
tournament thing i wanted to be like a fun unifying event
within the i guess like the this was my idea in making

91
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:36,230
something like more relaxing for everybody and more so of
just like a big event because I feel like a lot of things

92
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:46,530
that we lack in the western v-tubing side is an event that
uh that that basically unites uh different v-tubers from

93
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:54,090
different backgrounds different areas like company or and
indie because that's what we see in Japan we have like

94
00:12:57,470 --> 00:13:05,810
crazy raccoon we have vault room as well in japan i feel
like in the western side and the english vtubing sphere we

95
00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:15,030
don't even we don't really have stuff like this and um this
was actually something i've been planning on doing um it was

96
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:23,090
in my roadmap actually this was actually like in my roadmap
when it came to like where i wanted to go when it came to

97
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:31,610
organizing like events and this would be the very first time
i'm doing something like this from uh doing something like

98
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:44,030
this regarding having a big event that doesn't require any
skill so like anybody can join um um and like anybody can

99
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:52,390
join anybody can uh because all of this is gonna be wrestle
tube for those who don't know wrestle tuber uh you might

100
00:13:52,390 --> 00:14:03,130
remember a previous uh previous version of this event and is
practically a spiritual successor of that event and uh it

101
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:14,990
will be run on the wwe 2k24 edition of the game and
basically vtubers uh this is primarily for vtubers uh uh

102
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:25,530
from different companies or not company you know indies uh
coming together to um to be at during the interviews in the

103
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:31,770
pre and post interview and then they're and then they'll
have wrestlers that they're going to embody but it'll be cpu

104
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:41,030
controlled uh but they will be there a lot of these all
these vtubers that are participating will be here um and the

105
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:51,070
broadcast staff is actually uh a bunch of vtubers from
different places so you know uh we'll have like maybe like

106
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:52,890
some vtubers vtubers in the

107
00:14:56,110 --> 00:15:05,570
And also, like I said, there will be every participant in
WrestleTuber will receive a little small care package to

108
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:11,250
thank them for participating and to thank them for, like,
you know, joining this event just because like, you know,

109
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:14,250
they're giving up their very own time to participate in
this.

110
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:15,730
There's like nobody's getting paid.

111
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:20,890
And then the broadcast staff, because I promised them
because I felt like, you know, since the main broadcast is

112
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:25,110
on my channel, I told the broadcast staff like any amount,
any of the donations.

113
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:34,050
the super chats that come in during the event will be split
between the broadcast staff just because it's fair and uh i

114
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:40,170
might put in a little extra as well because i feel like you
know they're giving up their time to be there to cast to

115
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:46,370
participate as the announcer to do the interview and stuff
like that so i'll be giving them some of the earnings from

116
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:56,950
the event anyway the rules one of the things you guys might
be wondering the rules basically I talked about the rules a

117
00:15:56,950 --> 00:16:07,650
little bit already so let me just reiterate some of some of
it alright let me rules so the official hashtag as you guys

118
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:21,350
all saw let me shimmy over here there you let me shimmy over
so the official hashtag is 2024.

119
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:28,570
So you can use this hashtag to submit your wrestlers,
illustrations, and Latui.

120
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:33,830
The event will be held on May 25th and 26th.

121
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:37,870
So Saturday and Sunday if you're in NA, Saturday and Sunday
at 4 p.m.

122
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:38,590
PST.

123
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:43,910
There will also be, this is going to be a new edition, but
show matches.

124
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:49,570
So for those who couldn't, for some of the YouTubers,
obviously they couldn't commit their full time because,

125
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:57,650
they're going to be eliminated like that is the whole
randomness of this whole event we don't know when they're

126
00:16:57,650 --> 00:17:05,570
going to be eliminated so we gave an options for the
participants to basically um we gave an option for the

127
00:17:05,570 --> 00:17:11,310
participants to basically uh decide if they want to show up
at the show matches which will be in the beginning of each

128
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:17,690
day and each of those participants that chose the show match
won't have to participate for one match and it'll be like

129
00:17:17,690 --> 00:17:25,510
maybe like cage matches or tag And we don't, like, it will
be announced during the event, the main broadcast.

130
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:30,270
So that will be, like, a surprise for the audience as to
what the show match is going to be.

131
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:33,090
So there is two formats for this.

132
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:36,970
Tournament run, obviously, it's, like, the full-on
tournament structure.

133
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:41,750
So, like, obviously, you know, they go until they're
eliminated.

134
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:46,610
And that is why it runs for two days, because it is very
long.

135
00:17:50,450 --> 00:18:03,170
had a hard cap but then like we got beyond the hard cap so
so it ended up not being a hard cap anymore so because I

136
00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:15,710
because there's some last-minute additions in there and I
was like fuck it let them in anyway as I said before the

137
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:25,790
wrestlers will be CPU controlled but all participants will
be there for interviews and or broadcast staff so until

138
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:32,390
they're eliminated type deal so they will be like showing up
on stream uh doing the interviews and like roasting each

139
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:42,850
other all of that stuff so they will be there in some way um
main broadcast will be on this channel but some participants

140
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:50,590
will stream their own wrestling creation before the event so
they some of them have decided to have chosen to create

141
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:58,390
their own wrestler and they will be making that wrestler
themselves on the stream for the fans to watch and i like i

142
00:18:58,390 --> 00:19:04,110
said before this will be an event that unites vtubers from
different backgrounds whether indie or company and represent

143
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:10,290
the spirit of vtubing because like i like i wanted i wanted
to do an event i feel like we are very lacking this in the

144
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:17,370
western vtuber side there's a lot of events that combines
like vtubing and like fleshy's together but like there's not

145
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:24,550
a lot of event that combines like v-tubing from different
companies as well or indies uh together to uh participate in

146
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:32,690
something uh big a great fun event uh and this was something
i wanted to do and we see a lot of that in japan but we

147
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:40,010
don't see really see that much in uh in like the western
side and that is what that was like my goal in doing this

148
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:50,130
hey guys before I show my the second rules page I feel like
a lot of guys want to know who are on the teams when I show

149
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:57,030
you guys the teams who are always on a team sorry the
participant participating members so there's actually two

150
00:19:57,030 --> 00:20:03,530
slides to the participating members but I'll it'll show the
first slide I'll be showing the first slide first obviously

151
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:13,990
uh because there was a lot of them I think we have 29 people
29 participants in total um obviously like there was

152
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:26,050
originally a super uh there was originally a super hard cap
but uh but it uh but it ended up going beyond that

153
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:46,680
so so so that's why we had 29 in the end But not all 29
wrestlers will be doing the tournament structure.

154
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:50,680
Some of them will be in show matches.

155
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:55,160
So that's why you must be like, 29, that's not even enough
for the tournament.

156
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:59,040
But that is because not all 29 of them are going to be in
the tournament.

157
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:02,460
Some of them are just going to be participating in the show
match.

158
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:06,300
And like I said earlier, if you don't see your OSHA, you
don't see your V2, I'm really sorry.

159
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:08,940
There was like, there was a lot.

160
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:11,240
There was a lot of interest.

161
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:18,140
And, like, at that point, like, I also didn't want to have,
like, too many from one sector.

162
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:25,840
So, like, and obviously, like, some, obviously, other areas,
there might not be a lot of interest was there regarding

163
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:26,340
that.

164
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:32,620
So there was a lot of interest in certain companies, and
there was a lot of interest within the indie sphere.

165
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,280
But I tried to balance it as best as I could.

166
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:47,140
And then obviously there were moments where like some of the
companies had their own events during this time or like

167
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:54,560
during that date and or And because of that they weren't
able to participate some like VTubers that wanted to

168
00:21:54,560 --> 00:22:03,660
participate couldn't participate due to the Overlapping the
schedule so within like either company wise or Or just like

169
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:05,600
within their own individual schedule.

170
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:08,220
Anyway, team's time.

171
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:21,420
It's team teams time wow all right so this is slide number
one um i need you guys to know um um like i said i reached

172
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:32,440
out um to a bunch of companies um because i really wanted to
um i reached out to a bunch of companies and i said like

173
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:40,540
okay there is a limit to how many per company can send and
uh and i obviously I really wanted to reach out to prison

174
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:49,520
like ex-prison project uh uh to participate in this uh in
this event uh because of everything that happened so I

175
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:58,120
reached out to one of the members in ex-prison project and
asked if they wanted to be in uh in WrestleTuber um really

176
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:04,460
happy to have yeah we there was actually a lot of interest
but unfortunately we had to cap it uh as I said like because

177
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:13,240
I didn't want to have like like one had spread it out more
evenly uh amongst the amongst the participants regarding

178
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:22,300
like which uh which like i'm writing like how many can each
company send so there was a hard limit for each company um

179
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:33,140
so like i said uh there are the participants in prison
ex-prison project um nia sarah emma uh luto asteria and non

180
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:43,900
and then in v show jo we have zentrea uh for the indies we
have saiyu phillian buff puff me shy lily limu maryweather

181
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:53,060

guys there's a slide two because we have 29.

182
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,340
there is a slide two

183
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:08,300
I feel like people are like, oh my god, what's in slide two?

184
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:14,040
I'm like, even I'm anxious.

00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:19,860
Even I'm fucking anxious on slide two.

186
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,760
But anyway, here is slide two.

187
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:31,200

So these are the 29 participants that will be participating
in WrestleTuber.

204
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:32,620
Like I said before, I'm really sorry we don't see your Oshi
or VTuber.

205
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:43,200
restituber it was very hard to like um it was very hard to
like limit participants as well as like when we came to

206
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:51,240
sending out invites and stuff at one point we sent out
invites to certain vtubers um but uh because they were very

207
00:26:51,240 --> 00:27:00,560
busy they weren't able to reply back in time um or like the
invite got lost so uh there were some uh there was also some

208
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:10,540
vtubers that uh originally was were but because we had to
change the date last minute we had some vtubers that

209
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:20,700
couldn't participate due to the change of the date so um and
of course there was also like obviously we had limited spots

210
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:26,640
and because of that uh we had to well i had to because like
i'm the sole organizer

211
00:27:30,870 --> 00:27:39,170
i am the sole organizer so i made the decision with myself,
the board, which is myself.

212
00:27:40,810 --> 00:27:52,810
That regarding like regarding like who can and who like
regarding like like when who to invite and like oh like what

213
00:27:52,810 --> 00:27:54,010
do we do with this?

214
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:57,470
The board as in me and me only.

215
00:27:59,490 --> 00:28:00,810
The dokey board.

216
00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:02,310
I am the Senate.

217
00:28:02,930 --> 00:28:13,710
Anyway, now you guys are wondering who is on the broadcast
staff so on the broadcast staff we have um the interviewer

218
00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:28,090
will be juna uh juna unangi from idol en the announcer will
be saiyu uh the casters will be me snuffy phillian octavio

219
00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:40,510
and gold bullet uh so that is uh the broadcast staff team uh
for the 25th and the 26th brought i'm so sorry gold bullet

220
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:43,690
i'm so i'm like blocking you

221
00:28:46,810 --> 00:28:56,190
but here is here is the broadcast staff um just so you guys
know for the casters um it's not going to be like all of us

222
00:28:56,190 --> 00:29:03,050
are just going to be on the casting table the reason why the
casting the casting table is uh the cat there's a lot of

223
00:29:03,050 --> 00:29:10,110
people in the casting uh broadcasting table is so that we
can basically mix and match in between.

224
00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:17,590
So because of that, it allows us to, like, for the, we don't
have, like, you know, one, two, like all of us don't have

225
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:19,830
the fucking cast all the way through.

226
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:27,390
We can take breaks in between and like mix and match the
combinations of the casters.

227
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:34,250
So like, and so like it allows us to rest a bit in between
and take breaks.

228
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:41,630
Because that was like one of the things I realized that
having a small pool of casters is not really like the best

229
00:29:41,630 --> 00:29:47,290
because like what if we want to take a break and it's very
long the thing is this is a very this is going to be a very

230
00:29:47,290 --> 00:29:57,570
long event due to how many participants there are so so it's
good to be able to mix and match the casters because in the

231
00:29:57,570 --> 00:30:04,110
end I remember I had like set casters for like certain days
but for this one we're going to be mixing in between it's

232
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:10,870
not gonna be mixed every match or so like maybe like this
combination will do like uh three to four like two three to

233
00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:19,590
four matches and then you know and then like later on we go
in with a new combination for three to four matches and uh

234
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:28,850
that is how it's gonna be also finally credits uh uh we have
this might be a very familiar team um because i love working

235
00:30:28,850 --> 00:30:34,970
with these people um when i do like projects and events i
tend to work with the same people because they know what i

236
00:30:34,970 --> 00:30:45,030
like they know what i want and um i know they do a really
good job uh so like i said there is uh the logo was done by

237
00:30:45,030 --> 00:30:53,830
ss sugar type um you see here the wrestle tuber uh the bell
will be designed by melie uh we will be showing you guys the

238
00:30:53,830 --> 00:31:05,130
design of the belt at a later stage um at a stage of the uh
like when it gets closer to the event i guess uh when it get

239
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:12,870
closer to the event the belt design will be shown there will
be multiple belts why multiple because those that won the

240
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:21,070
show matches will also be sent a belt so the winners of the
show matches will get their own belt as well as well as the

241
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:31,750
tournament uh and uh and like i said um everybody that
participates and souvenir from me um to thank them for

242
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:40,690
participating so everybody gets something and gamer subs
will be sponsoring all of this so gamer subs is paying for

243
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:49,330
all the the gifts as well as the belts the graphics um
basically anything that uh that needs to be paid for this

244
00:31:49,330 --> 00:32:01,150
event is paid for by gamer subs so huge shout out to them
because like it's a lot of stuff I felt it's actually crazy

245
00:32:01,150 --> 00:32:05,330
the amount of support for my very first big event.

246
00:32:05,850 --> 00:32:13,130
And finally, OniPilot for designing all the graphics that
you see here for WrestleTuber.

247
00:32:13,790 --> 00:32:14,090
Yay!

248
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:17,270
All right, finally, rules.

249
00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:20,150
Before, it's not over yet, guys.

250
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:25,850
It's not over yet because we still have the matchups that we
have to do, the brackets scenario,

251
00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:39,170
Almost forgot to show you guys rules two and three All
right, rules two and three Where's rules two?

252
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:53,910
All right, rules two Wrestlers will be created in WWE 2K24
The deadline for the wrestler's submission will be May 24th

253
00:32:53,910 --> 00:33:03,110
So it's the day before the event is for both the VTubers
that are creating the wrestlers and for the fan submissions.

254
00:33:03,770 --> 00:33:12,470
So just remember like if you're making when we, I will be
giving a list of the VTubers that will be using your fan

255
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:18,310
submission wrestler and the deadline will be May 24th.

256
00:33:18,370 --> 00:33:24,710
The wrestlers have to be male so that they can all wrestle
each other in the tournament.

257
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:27,750
So They have to be male.

258
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:29,890
Just because that's the only way.

259
00:33:29,910 --> 00:33:32,190
There's no like in the tournament structure.

260
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:34,450
You can't put like female male wrestlers together.

261
00:33:34,870 --> 00:33:37,850
So we have to decide like it has to be all male.

262
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:39,130
For stats.

263
00:33:39,910 --> 00:33:41,950
Sorry I forgot to lock myself in.

264
00:33:42,210 --> 00:33:46,330
For stats.

265
00:33:46,850 --> 00:33:52,890
Please have the attributes have an overall range of 85.

266
00:33:53,510 --> 00:33:55,530
It has to be 85.

267
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:56,970
It can't be 84.

268
00:33:57,190 --> 00:33:58,670
It can't be 86.

269
00:33:59,010 --> 00:34:01,370
It has to be 85.

270
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:09,090
So when you're doing all your stats configuration, 85 has to
be the overall stat.

271
00:34:09,650 --> 00:34:21,490
When uploading your wrestler, please use these tags,
WrestleTuber2024, VTubers, VT WWE, and like I said, WWE

272
00:34:21,490 --> 00:34:22,910
2K24.

273
00:34:23,310 --> 00:34:25,530
This is the game that we will be using for.

274
00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:35,110
the tournament structure we will using the steam version
with all the dlc you don't have to have the dlc um we you

275
00:34:35,110 --> 00:34:40,670
don't have that the dlc if you're creating a wrestler but
like if you have the dlc it's just more customization so

276
00:34:40,670 --> 00:34:46,230

00:35:24,050 --> 00:35:30,450
not for you guys i assume you guys know but like a lot of
the people that joined this they haven't played wwe 2k uh

283
00:35:30,450 --> 00:35:37,170
2-4 yet so like didn't know like how to create their custom
rest of there so i basically like wrote a step-by-step guide

284
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:47,630
for everybody in the server regarding like how to do this
anyway uniformly customized the superstar entrance victory

285
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:57,910
and moveset video is not required it's not mandatory but if
you do it be funny because like you can put any video in the

286
00:35:57,910 --> 00:36:03,550
backdrop obviously it has to be like if you're gonna do a
video in the backdrop please make it to us friendly

287
00:36:03,550 --> 00:36:23,850
especially the fan submission as long as it's tos friendly
it's fine that's all that's all i asked for it now now rules

288
00:36:23,850 --> 00:36:31,010
number will be creating the wrestler on stream and who will
be using fan submitted wrestlers.

289
00:36:31,930 --> 00:36:32,830
Rules 3.

290
00:36:33,410 --> 00:36:33,610
Alright.

291
00:36:35,270 --> 00:36:39,850
So, these are the people that will be making their wrestler
on stream.

292
00:36:40,250 --> 00:36:46,570
So, you might be seeing, you might notice that I also gave
like two weeks leeway this time around instead of one week.

293
00:36:47,290 --> 00:36:51,690
Because I felt like one week was too short.

294
00:36:55,390 --> 00:37:08,750
one week was um honestly uh way too short so that's why like
people who are making their own wrestler um they can have

295
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:18,170
they can it's easier to schedule for everybody so um so we
gave everyone two weeks to create their own wrestler so here

296
00:37:18,170 --> 00:37:30,350
are the people that are making it on stream uh Nia, Rin,
Fuyo, Arac, Luto, Kai, Beto, Gerard, Remilia, Non, Limu,

297
00:37:30,810 --> 00:37:33,430
Shinri, Sarah, Octavio, and Meriwether.

298
00:37:33,870 --> 00:37:39,550
These are, you're going to be seeing streams of the people
making their wrestler on those channels.

299
00:37:39,770 --> 00:37:45,850
So please feel free to visit their channels to see them
customize their very own wrestler.

300
00:37:46,850 --> 00:37:53,290
All right, these are the participants that will be using
your wrestler, including me, I don't have time to make my

301
00:37:53,290 --> 00:37:53,770
own.

302
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,240
I'm sorry.

303
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:08,380
As much as I would love to stream the wrestler creation with
all you guys, I'm sorry.

304
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:09,200
I don't have time.

305
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:13,560
I barely have time to set up my own PC guy.

306
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:28,360
Yorosama, Axel, Sayu, Buff, Buff, Snuffy, Haka, Me, Sia,
Shai Lily, Gold Bullet, Juna, Emma, and Phillion.

307
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:32,360
These are the people that will be using your wrestlers.

308
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:40,020
So if you're making a wrestler for us to use, please make
wrestlers for these people, including me.

309
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:43,140
You can make as many as you guys want.

310
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:47,020
They will be picking the wrestler to represent themselves.

311
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:50,740
So like, you know, obviously they'll try and pick the one
that looks the best.

312
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:51,880
Like looks, I don't know.

313
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:58,340
like i let them pick the wrestler that they want to
represent them so maybe they'll be like oh this one looks so

314
00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:05,400
fucking funny so i'll use that so obviously the use though
try to i don't know try to see what you think they would

315
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:11,280
want because some of them will actually be talking on stream
about what kind of wrestler they want to represent them so

316
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:18,740
uh i know like buff puff puff puff was gonna talk on stream
about like oh what kind of wrestler she uh they want to see

317
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:27,780
and then um and then like several other streamers are going
to be doing that as well so maybe take some notes and see

318
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:37,420
what they decide they want to see in to have a wrestler
wrestler represent them all right funny it's time it's

319
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:45,600
fucking time it's matchup time so i realized there was one
thing i did miss in which was to let you guys know who will

320
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:52,720
be participating in the show matches and who will be
participating in the tournament i'll actually i'll just like

321
00:39:52,720 --> 00:40:00,840
read out the list of the show matches to you right now
because i didn't write it down i knew i forgot to write down

322
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:13,180
something so um these are people that will be only
participating in these show matches as in they'll only be

323
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:20,160
there for the beginning for one match and then they'll have
to it's due to scheduling like i said a lot of this is due

324
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:25,780
to scheduling and the fact that like you know for some it's
like some people are in eu so they couldn't stay up for too

325
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:31,020
long uh because like we don't know when this is going to end
so they're like oh yeah like at this point like they're like

326
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:36,720
oh yeah i don't know if i can stay up for that long so i'll
be there for the beginning for the show matches or just it

327
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:44,180
was just like time constraints and scheduling um so some of
you chose the show matches um the participants in show

328
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:46,160
matches will be uh

329
00:40:51,220 --> 00:41:01,880
Zentrea and Shy Lily we have six wrestlers that will only be
there for the show matches also per tradition at the very

330
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:13,280
end we will have a free for all wrestling free for all
wrestling event with everybody in the end for like the

331
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:20,680
ultimate wrestler so we will be included they might not be
there spirit they might not be there in the call when this

332
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:33,280
happens but they will be there spiritually because we'll
throw them in for the free for all anyway it's time for the

333
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:44,680
brackets but oh my gosh I'm so long since I did like
announcement I'm since I did like announcement streams yeah

334
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:51,360
alright I'm pulling up the wheel alright one of the things
that I wasn't able to make in time was like I actually made

335
00:41:51,360 --> 00:42:00,560
like a a like a text like text and OBS for everybody's names
that are in the tournament I didn't manage to make that in

336
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:14,540
time only managed to make one name so we're doing it live
there will be no spinning the wheel for there will be no

337
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:20,180
spinning the wheel for the show matches that will be a
surprise for everybody.

338
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:23,480
I guess for the wrestlers as well.

339
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:31,820
So the show matches, wrestlers will be a surprise as to who
is going to be matched up with who.

340
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:33,200
Because it can be anything.

341
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:34,320
It could be cage matches.

342
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:35,520
It could be tag team.

343
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:37,360
It could be literally anything.

344
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:39,400
Because there's so many different types of matches.

345
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:43,360
So the wheel.

346
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:45,880
It is the wheel.

347
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:49,940
Um, all right, let's spin the wheel.

348
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:52,020
Who will be the first one?

349
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:53,560
Let's spin the wheel.

350
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:56,300
All right.

351
00:42:57,380 --> 00:42:58,040

incompetent.

429
00:51:38,870 --> 00:51:41,710
It's actually very impressive at this point.

430
00:51:42,250 --> 00:51:42,470
All right.

431
00:51:42,910 --> 00:51:46,330
Anna Nunn is our first matchup in this bracket.

432
00:51:48,310 --> 00:51:51,010
Who is Anna Nunn going to be facing against?

433
00:51:52,150 --> 00:51:54,490
I must tell lies.

434
00:51:55,390 --> 00:51:55,690
Nia!

435
00:51:56,650 --> 00:51:57,450
Oh my God.

436
00:51:57,910 --> 00:52:00,710
Is ex-prison versus ex-prison?

437
00:52:00,730 --> 00:52:02,710
Let's fucking go.

438
00:52:04,430 --> 00:52:05,610
Fight, fight, fight.

439
00:52:07,270 --> 00:52:11,230
I love it when there's infighting and I'm not involved in
just watching.

440
00:52:15,350 --> 00:52:16,090
Oh my god.

441
00:52:16,350 --> 00:52:21,810
At last I can just watch when the infighting starts and I
don't have to be involved in the drama.

442
00:52:24,030 --> 00:52:25,970
Fight, fight, fight, civil war.

443
00:52:26,130 --> 00:52:26,830
Let's go.

444
00:52:27,610 --> 00:52:29,250
What a script.

445
00:52:30,810 --> 00:52:31,410
Real.

446
00:52:32,230 --> 00:52:33,950
Alright, next up in this matchup.

447
00:52:34,010 --> 00:52:34,910
Araka Luto.

448
00:52:36,150 --> 00:52:40,310
Alright, let me fucking put that in.

449
00:52:41,730 --> 00:52:42,490
Luto is here.

450
00:52:43,270 --> 00:52:44,350
Alright, next up.

451
00:52:44,450 --> 00:52:46,330
Who is Luto gonna fight against?

452
00:52:48,270 --> 00:52:52,150
I like how all the Hall of Stars guys are like dodging each
other at the moment.

453
00:52:55,330 --> 00:52:58,970
It would be Sayu versus Luto.

454
00:53:01,510 --> 00:53:02,110
Alright.

455
00:53:02,290 --> 00:53:05,530
Our announcer is going to be joining the fight.

456
00:53:06,670 --> 00:53:09,610
Let me fucking change this real fast.

457
00:53:10,290 --> 00:53:11,510
Boop, boop, boop.

458
00:53:12,350 --> 00:53:12,610
Hey!

459
00:53:13,510 --> 00:53:14,750
Sayu sweep.

460
00:53:15,810 --> 00:53:20,990
I wonder who's going to win between a fucking...

461
00:53:20,990 --> 00:53:22,630
That shit's it.

462
00:53:29,150 --> 00:53:32,150
If anything, you guys roast better than me anyway.

463
00:53:32,290 --> 00:53:43,290
uh the announcer joins the scuffer seagull versus saiyu say
it coward whatever i say will never be as bad as what chat

464
00:53:43,290 --> 00:53:50,330
says i swear chat is like way more creative and coming up
with like roasts than me because you guys have like a group

465
00:53:50,330 --> 00:53:56,510
effort and then i'd steal your roast and then pose it off as
my own roast and then people be like wow doki you're so

466
00:53:56,510 --> 00:54:06,850
fucking clever and i was like thanks i came the next matchup

getting smaller the wheel is finally getting smaller we're

468
00:54:15,370 --> 00:54:27,630

pretty obvious Juno Nagi will be fighting against

469
00:54:32,050 --> 00:54:41,030
a bird and an eel i think birds eat eels don't they i mean i
guess like if if juna's like electric um maybe like she can

470
00:54:41,030 --> 00:54:49,230
zap haka because like birds are what i know from pokemon is
that birds are weak against electricity uh to be fair

471
00:54:49,230 --> 00:54:57,330
everybody's weak against electricity except for like i guess
electric eels uh wait have you said has anyone okay saying

472
00:54:57,330 --> 00:55:04,290
that is like technically like unethical like zapping an
electric eel but i'm just thinking like can like eels get

473
00:55:04,290 --> 00:55:11,490
like can electric eels technically get electrocuted and by
getting electrocuted like do they just like get is it just

474
00:55:11,490 --> 00:55:21,170
like neutral to them or like well can they die from
electricity like that's what what aren't you guys wait they

490
00:56:40,910 --> 00:56:41,850
Oh, Ramelea!

491
00:56:42,250 --> 00:56:48,450
Philean will be fighting Ramelea for the final matchup for
bracket number two.

492
00:56:48,990 --> 00:56:51,510
I think we're finally, we have one last bracket, guys.

495
00:56:59,770 --> 00:57:03,150
All right, Philean versus Remilia.

496
00:57:03,690 --> 00:57:05,850

All right, the final seven.

499
00:57:12,570 --> 00:57:16,810
One person will be lucky and, like, I guess, like, move on
without fighting anybody.

500
00:57:17,610 --> 00:57:28,810
So, one person will be very lucky and they just move on
without fighting.

00:59:01,970 --> 00:59:03,910
Who will Sarah play against?

514
00:59:06,590 --> 00:59:08,210
Doki is dodging the wheel.

515
00:59:08,350 --> 00:59:09,430

Guys, I don't even get a free pass.

526
01:00:00,430 --> 01:00:01,490
It's not rigged.

527
01:00:01,790 --> 01:00:03,270
Who am I matching up against?

528
01:00:04,330 --> 01:00:04,730

01:00:06,010 --> 01:00:06,490
Maladoki.

531
01:00:09,050 --> 01:00:10,090

538
01:01:23,750 --> 01:01:26,250
Octavio, either Beto or Sia.

539
01:01:27,590 --> 01:01:32,170
And one person will get to have a free pass.

540
01:01:32,350 --> 01:01:34,230
And that one person is Beto.

541
01:01:39,270 --> 01:01:43,270
Finally, the last two matchups.

542
01:01:44,970 --> 01:01:46,950
Octavio versus Sia.

543
01:01:47,650 --> 01:01:50,030
And Beto versus nobody.

544
01:01:50,270 --> 01:02:00,150
he gets a free pass he gets the fucking lady luck blessing
him today um all right boom all right but here are your

545
01:02:00,150 --> 01:02:08,770
brackets guys bracket three um i don't have bracket one and
two because i literally just overwrite wrote one and two so

546
01:02:08,770 --> 01:02:17,630
like if you want to know where bracket one and two is feel
free to um we're eliminating a lot of holostar members right

547
01:02:17,630 --> 01:02:21,370
off the bat like i don't i don't know how Is that possible?

548
01:02:23,890 --> 01:02:25,010
Because even they survive.

549
01:02:25,250 --> 01:02:26,790
Even they survive here.

550
01:02:27,590 --> 01:02:29,630
Like they have to fight against each other.

551
01:02:30,410 --> 01:02:31,990
So battle versus battle.

552
01:02:32,130 --> 01:02:32,470
You know what?

553
01:02:32,550 --> 01:02:33,150
That'll be fun.

554
01:02:33,590 --> 01:02:35,410
If there's more than one battle wrestler.

555
01:02:35,930 --> 01:02:38,410
We'll have two battles fighting against each other.

556
01:02:38,810 --> 01:02:40,750
And then we'll see whichever battle wins.

557
01:02:40,850 --> 01:02:42,270
Will be the battle representative.

558
01:02:42,850 --> 01:02:45,770
So if there's so many battle fan wrestlers.

559
01:02:45,970 --> 01:02:47,350
We'll have them fight each other.

560
01:02:47,730 --> 01:02:48,470
And then yeah.

561
01:02:48,650 --> 01:02:49,670
And battle two.

562
01:02:50,270 --> 01:02:52,310
Clearly would win the tournament, maybe.

563
01:02:56,270 --> 01:02:57,790
If he's lucky.

564
01:02:58,710 --> 01:03:00,830
Maybe Battle 2 would end up sweeping everything.

565
01:03:01,990 --> 01:03:06,670
Battle 2.

566
01:03:07,590 --> 01:03:09,030
Alright, Battle versus Battle.

567
01:03:10,030 --> 01:03:11,330
I feel like that's like the best.

568
01:03:12,910 --> 01:03:14,630
The mirror match.

569
01:03:18,270 --> 01:03:20,050
Gold bullet is...

570
01:03:20,270 --> 01:03:21,730
will be in a show match.

571
01:03:21,930 --> 01:03:25,270
Go Bullet is not in the tournament, but they will be there
for casting.

572
01:03:25,510 --> 01:03:30,530
They will be there throughout the tournament for
casting-wise, but they said that originally they wanted to

573
01:03:30,530 --> 01:03:35,610
do just casting, but it'll be great if you can be in the
show match, just to even out the show matches.

574
01:03:36,850 --> 01:03:39,770
So anyway, yes, here are all the brackets.

575
01:03:40,390 --> 01:03:42,690
I don't have one and two because I overrode it.

576
01:03:42,890 --> 01:03:48,210
So if you want to know what one and two the brackets were,
please look at Twitter, I guess.

577
01:03:50,730 --> 01:03:55,010
Or rewind this VOD if you are a VOD watching.

578
01:03:59,670 --> 01:04:02,130
So, very professional, Doki.

579
01:04:02,590 --> 01:04:07,650
You've been hosting and organizing events for so long, and
you're still just as incompetent.

580
01:04:11,970 --> 01:04:14,870
Hey, I'm super hyped for this, honestly.

581
01:04:15,090 --> 01:04:18,770

596
01:06:23,180 --> 01:06:31,020
thank you to all the participants they are giving their own
time to participate in this event um like this was a very

597
01:06:31,020 --> 01:06:37,700
ambitious project for me one of the hardest things i've ever
organized uh solely by myself by the way uh there was no

598
01:06:37,700 --> 01:06:44,780
outside management my management team did not help me
organize this because i chose to do this myself um they

599
01:06:44,780 --> 01:06:51,480
offered but because i felt like i wanted this to be more
less i wanted to be less serious and by not having like

600
01:06:51,920 --> 01:07:01,320
there it gives off a more carefree vibe um a more carefree
vibe a less serious like try hard thing we're all just there

601
01:07:01,320 --> 01:07:11,600
to make memories and enjoy an event together um so like
everything was done uh solely by me when it comes to uh

602
01:07:11,600 --> 01:07:20,180
organizing all of this and reaching out to people and uh and
inviting them to participate uh like i said a huge shout out

603
01:07:20,180 --> 01:07:27,320
to everybody for saying yes to this and for joining the
server and for willing to give their own time because this

604
01:07:27,320 --> 01:07:31,960
event lasts a very long time because we all know how long it
took last time so

605
01:07:37,260 --> 01:07:45,920
so like it's understandable that like super like that like
people were like oh i don't know because it was a very it is

606
01:07:45,920 --> 01:07:56,480
a very long event and uh i originally had a hard cap to be
for participants but then that hard cap became a softer cap

607
01:07:56,480 --> 01:08:07,320
and then and then later on became a hard cap because i was
like oh man that's that was long that's a lot of people

608
01:08:10,760 --> 01:08:14,680
i was like yeah that was a lot of people

609
01:08:18,100 --> 01:08:26,780
um um so please check out all the v-tubers that are
participating, that are giving up their time to be part of

610
01:08:26,780 --> 01:08:32,140
this event, and to just celebrate v-tubing in general.

611
01:08:33,380 --> 01:08:42,160
I hope by doing this, there might be more incentives for
more big events similar to this, where it can unite various

612
01:08:42,160 --> 01:08:56,940
companies and various indies together, just like how we see
it in Japan, of uh shibuya hell and uh and cr and crazy

613
01:08:56,940 --> 01:09:04,160
raccoon and this is basically like uh there's basically
something i want to do equivalent to that and i hope that

614
01:09:04,160 --> 01:09:12,360
this inspires more events like this in the future not just
from me but from other uh but from other people that want to

615
01:09:12,360 --> 01:09:23,080
organize events as well because i feel like like i said this
is what we heavily lacked in the english vtubing or from

616
01:09:23,080 --> 01:09:29,220
indies that are just indies or like or like vtubers and
fleshies or like come within the company but we don't have

617
01:09:29,220 --> 01:09:35,880
events we don't really have events that unite people from
different places and this is why i wanted to do this was

618
01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:46,340
literally my next roadmap uh something i wanted to evolve
into the future with uh so yeah yeah i

619
01:09:52,700 --> 01:10:02,280
really appreciate it guys i really um i really do appreciate
you guys all showing up for this very special announcement

620
01:10:02,280 --> 01:10:10,460

am i swear the most unlucky bird ever when it comes to like

621
01:10:10,460 --> 01:10:20,860
important things that i have to do i swear i'm just so
unlucky so i really appreciate you guys sticking around even

622
01:10:20,860 --> 01:10:32,500
though we had a very rough start and being super hyped for
this event a lot of fun both fans and the vtubers alike and

623
01:10:32,500 --> 01:10:40,240
i cannot wait to see what kind of roast they're gonna do to
each other i wonder betta's gonna roast himself i just see

624
01:10:40,240 --> 01:10:42,240
him like looking at the mirror

625

better than you hey guys that was the announcement i'm gonna

626
01:10:55,920 --> 01:11:03,020
rest now next week is technically my week except for Tekken
I guess I'll just be grinding Tekken for Sejan slam it's

627
01:11:03,020 --> 01:11:11,400

is semi rest week because mostly I'll just be grinding

628
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:17,960
Tekken instead of doing anything else but I might not be
streaming a lot of the Tekken thing I'll definitely be

629
01:11:17,960 --> 01:11:25,520
streaming the fucking rounds I guess of all the stuff that's
going on like the the tournament itself I don't know if I'll

630
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:29,040
be maybe I'll stream like one practice match uh But who
