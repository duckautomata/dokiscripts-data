1
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:56,380
Oh my god, I'm so sorry!

2
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:01,160
Oh, we crash, we crash.

3
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:03,200
We're just gonna have crash... we crash, we crash.

4
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:04,920
We have crashes every 15 minutes.

5
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,900
That's just the way of life.

6
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:07,940
It's the Doki life.

7
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,260
DokiBrit has never been lucky.

8
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:16,080
I work very hard, but sometimes life just goes, fuck you.

9
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:21,100
Never been lucky in life.

10
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,220
I've accepted it.

11
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:28,160
I basically what I basically remade everything.

12
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,060
I had to remake everything.

13
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,980
I even deleted my old scene collection.

14
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,540
I deleted my fucking normal streaming collection.

15
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:38,720
Like so because I was just like, oh no, what's going on?

16
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,120
Because it always happens.

17
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:43,980
I don't know if this happens very often, like not very often.

18
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,960
But it's like random.

19
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,660
If I make a new scene collection, sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't.

20
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:51,900
But it hits at like the most random moments.

21
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:55,420
And then when it hits, it crashes every 15 minutes.

22
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:58,900
Like OBS in general, it crashes every 15 minutes.

23
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,940
So like it's so hard to like sometimes predict when it's gonna happen.

24
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:07,560
And then like while I was setting up, it didn't hit until like when I was about to start the stream.

25
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:11,300
And then when it hit, I was like, oh fuck, okay, I'm gonna try to do the fast way.

26
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,480
Because usually the fast way is like a 50-50 chance for it to work.

27
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,680
So then I was like, okay, I'm gonna do it the fast way.

28
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:19,720
Maybe the fast way will be fine.

29
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,400
And then obviously we had to wait 15 minutes.

30
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,280
And then I was like, oh, it did not work.

31
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:26,940
The fast way did not work.

32
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,920
So I guess I'll just do the slow way.

33
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:36,560
But the slow way isn't guaranteed either.

34
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:40,900
It just has a higher percentage of guaranteeing.

35
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:42,300
Anyway.

36
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:48,140
To be fair, to be fair, what I'm announcing...

37
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:50,640
Oh my gosh, there's so much work that went into this.

38
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,120
I'm just... I don't know.

39
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,080
I hope I got everything...

40
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,900
I hope like I got everything in.

41
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,320
Because like I had to set up really, really fucking fast.

42
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:07,760
So like I don't even know if I set everything up properly.

43
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:12,180
I was just like, okay, everything looks... I think everything's in.

44
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:14,980
And then I just went, oh, fuck it, we bought it.

45
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:17,540
We fucking bought...

46
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:21,220
Guys, I swear, I'm gonna set my new PC today or tomorrow.

47
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:23,180
It's just there's so many things going on.

48
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:25,260
So I didn't have time to do anything.

49
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,560
What's happening?

50
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:32,180
That's a very good question.

51
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:38,500
I bet you guys are all very, very curious as to what this announcement's going to be.

52
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,660
I mean, of course, it could be anything.

53
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:43,020
I saw... I was like looking at wrong answers only.

54
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:45,900
And I saw a lot of people giving so many different answers.

55
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,020
Someone actually got it right.

56
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,400
Someone was like, wrong answer.

57
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:52,840
But then it was actually the right answer.

58
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:53,920
So it's fucking crazy.

59
00:04:55,980 --> 00:05:01,780
What if you guys actually got the answer correct while we were giving wrong answer only?

60
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,720
So it was very interesting to see.

61
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:05,780
Hey, guys.

62
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:06,360
All right.

63
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,080
I mean, I could like bait you guys longer.

64
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:09,820
I could like make you guys wait even longer.

65
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:11,840
But we you guys already waited 36 minutes.

66
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,480
So let's do a countdown.

67
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,100
Let's get a drum roll, please.

68
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:18,020
Drum roll, everybody.

69
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:22,940
Ten, nine, eight, seven.

70
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,940
It would be so funny if I crashed this moment.

71
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:25,500
Annoying me.

72
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:27,080
This I fucking can jinx myself.

73
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:36,380
Eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.

74
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,440
Yes, everybody.

75
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:44,560
WrestleTuber is here.

76
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:46,700
Yeah.

77
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:51,110
No, I didn't mute my mic.

78
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:53,010
I just let you guys enjoy the moment.

79
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:57,950
You know, just like absorb the moment as it's going as you see the logo.

80
00:06:58,070 --> 00:07:04,290
So you might be noticing something in the backdrop that's different other than just the WrestleTuber logo.

81
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:06,250
But this whole event.

82
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:09,990
Will be sponsored by Gamersubs.

83
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:13,850
In a way where basically I didn't have to pay for anything.

84
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:23,890
So a huge shout out to Gamersubs for providing the funding for the graphics.

85
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:28,550
For the wrestling belts.

86
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:30,010
Like you hear the plural.

87
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:32,410
Belts and other goodies.

88
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:35,370
So Gamersubs is the official sponsor.

89
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:38,170
For WrestleTuber 2024.

90
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:41,510
So you guys might be wondering.

91
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:44,290
What is WrestleTuber?

92
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:46,630
But before I answer that.

93
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:47,590
I just need you guys to know.

94
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:49,670
There's so many like last minute things that happened.

95
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:51,430
Before this announcement.

96
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:55,790
That like I literally was like scrounging up the last couple of details.

97
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:59,510
Like two hours before this stream was supposed to air.

98
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:02,690
Because like there was some last minute additions.

99
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:05,170
And there was also.

100
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:07,830
There was also like some.

101
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:09,650
We were actually was gonna have a video.

102
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:11,230
To like show it and stuff.

103
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:13,570
Just like the logo.

104
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:17,310
But because there's so many last minute additions.

105
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:19,710
A video was not made in time.

106
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:22,330
And I hope the video editor is okay.

107
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:26,790
Because I was like I'm so sorry.

108
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:30,070
We have some last minute additions to be made.

109
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:31,850
And because of that.

110
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:34,390
The videos.

111
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:36,210
Video was not done in time.

112
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:36,750
But it was.

113
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:38,590
It's a really sick video.

114
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:40,210
So when it is done.

115
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:42,250
I cannot wait to show you guys.

116
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:45,250
Anyway.

117
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:47,370
Yes.

118
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:48,710
WrestleTuber.

119
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:49,590
2024.

120
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:52,490
I feel like you guys will be like.

121
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:53,690
Wanting to know.

122
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:56,450
The one thing you guys really want to know at the moment.

123
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:57,830
Is who is participating.

124
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:00,010
Let's just say.

125
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:00,770
Is.

126
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:03,230
This has to be like honestly.

127
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:06,830
One of the hardest fucking event I've ever organized.

128
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:07,770
Ever.

129
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:09,870
Because there's so many people.

130
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:11,450
From different backgrounds.

131
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:12,710
Different companies.

132
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:14,750
Either company or indie.

133
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:16,930
And like trying to coordinate.

134
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:19,450
With so many different people.

135
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:22,050
And then like trying to grab information.

136
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:23,770
And grabbing.

137
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:26,930
And grabbing like graphics and everything.

138
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:27,910
I sometimes.

139
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:29,350
I even got like graphics.

140
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:32,510
During the last five hours.

141
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:33,650
Before the stream.

142
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:35,290
I got some of the graphics.

143
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:36,010
The last five.

144
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:36,970
And then like poking people.

145
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:37,190
Be like.

146
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:37,590

So that I can know the reply.

00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:25,530
I swear.

185
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:28,490
This is absolutely one of the hardest events.

186
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:29,770
I've ever organized.

187
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:30,770
Only because.

188
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:32,410
There's just so many different people.

189
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:33,450
From different backgrounds.

190
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:35,210
And trying to grab information.

191
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:36,630
Trying to grab intel.

192
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:37,390
Like.

193
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:38,390
Trying to.

194
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:40,490
Trying to grab graphics.

195
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:41,090
Trying to coordinate.

196
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:42,230
Scheduling too.

197
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:43,430
Oh my gosh.

198
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:44,030
I'm so sorry.

199
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:44,870
If you don't see some of your.

200
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:45,650
Like.

201
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:46,270
Oshi.

202
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:47,590
If you don't see your Oshi.

203
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:48,450
Or your content creator.

204
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:48,790
Like.

205
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:49,530
A content creator.

206
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:51,190
You actually really wanted to see in WrestleTuber.

207
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:52,050
Um.

208
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:53,010
That's not there.

209
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:55,790
Scheduling was so fucking hard.

210
00:10:56,170 --> 00:10:57,950
And I also had to cap it too.

211
00:10:58,250 --> 00:10:59,690
Because there was so much interest.

212
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:01,490
That I had to cap it.

213
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:02,470
At one point.

214
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:03,510
And then.

215
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:04,150
I had.

216
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:04,730
And then like.

217
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:05,150
We had like.

218
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:05,530
Uh.

219
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:07,470
Maybe like one or two people dropped out.

220
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:08,490
Because the scheduling wise.

221
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:09,890
For everybody was different.

222
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:11,270
And because of that.

223
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:11,730
Because there's like.

224
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:12,070
Like I said.

225
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:13,190
It's different companies.

226
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:14,270
Or like.

227
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:14,790
Indies.

228
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:16,970
And then everybody has different scheduling.

229
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:17,830
And then there's like.

230
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:18,910
Conventions going on.

231
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:19,330
There's like.

232
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:20,230
Other stuff going on.

233
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:21,290
Within that company.

234
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:22,050
So.

235
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:23,010
Because of that.

236
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:23,750
Um.

237
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:25,950
Because of that.

238
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:26,630
We had like.

239
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:27,570
Moments where like.

240
00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:27,930
Uh.

241
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:28,710
Maybe like.

242
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:29,670
Somebody dropped out.

243
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:30,450
And then.

244
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:32,590
They got like.

245
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:33,550
For the event.

246
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:34,310
Uh.

247
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:34,950
And all.

248
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:35,570
Oh my gosh.

249
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:35,910
It was.

250
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:36,710
A lot.

251
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:39,070
I need you guys to know.

252
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:40,430
This is fully.

253
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:41,850
Organized.

254
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:43,130
And prepared by.

255
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:44,430
Me only.

256
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:46,390
There's no team behind it.

257
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:48,930
Despite gamer subs is sponsoring this.

258
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,590
I've organized all of this myself.

259
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:53,350
Like every information.

260
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:54,670
Setting up the discord server.

261
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:56,130
Coordinating everything.

262
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:57,870
Reaching out to people.

263
00:11:58,250 --> 00:11:59,390
All of this.

264
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:00,190
Was done.

265
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:01,110
By me.

266
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:02,390
And me only.

267
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:02,450
So.

268
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:18,810
I didn't want to make this like a super serious, like a very official tournament thing.

269
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:26,470
I wanted to be like a fun unifying event within the, I guess like the Western VTuber sphere.

270
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:34,270
Like this was my idea in making something like more relaxing for everybody and more so of just like a big event.

271
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:50,850
Because I feel like a lot of things that we lack in the Western VTuber side is an event that basically unites different VTubers from different backgrounds, different areas, like company or an indie.

272
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:52,810
Because that's what we see in Japan.

273
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:56,450
We have like Shibuya Hal organizing a lot of these types of events.

274
00:12:56,450 --> 00:12:58,670
We have Crazy Raccoon.

275
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:01,530
We have Vault Room as well in Japan.

276
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:09,090
But I feel like in the Western side, in the English VTuber sphere, we don't even, we don't really have stuff like this.

277
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:12,650
And this was actually something I've been planning on doing.

278
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:16,530
It was in my roadmap actually.

279
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:21,850
This was actually like in my roadmap when it came to like where I wanted to go.

280
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:25,750
When it came to organizing like events and stuff like that.

281
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:29,810
And so like this would be the very first time I'm doing something like this.

282
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:36,530
Doing something like this regarding having a big event that doesn't require any skill.

283
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:40,710
So like anybody can join.

284
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:44,210
And like anybody can join.

285
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:45,530
Anybody can...

286
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:48,930
Because all of this is gonna be WrestleTuber.

287
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:55,730
For those who don't know WrestleTuber, you might remember a previous previous version of WrestleTuber.

288
00:13:55,730 --> 00:13:56,970
And this is a new version of this event.

289
00:13:57,130 --> 00:14:01,010
And this is practically a spiritual successor of that event.

290
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:08,190
And it will be run on the WWE 2K24 edition of the game.

291
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:18,790
And basically VTubers, this is primarily for VTubers from different companies or not company, you know, indies.

292
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:26,590
Coming together to to be at during the interviews in the pre and post interview.

293
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:27,690
And then they're...

294
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:30,130
And then they'll have wrestlers that they're gonna embody.

295
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:32,070
But it'll be CPU controlled.

296
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:34,350
But they will be there.

297
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:35,270
A lot of these...

298
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:38,570
All these VTubers that are participating will be here.

299
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:47,570
And the broadcast staff is actually a bunch of VTubers from different places.

300
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:54,110
So, you know, we'll have like maybe like some VTubers VTubers in the broadcast staff that are both company.

301
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:55,210
And indie.

302
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:58,570
And also, like I said, there will be...

303
00:14:58,570 --> 00:15:06,470
Every participant in WrestleTuber will receive a little small care package to thank them for participating.

304
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:10,390
And to thank them for like, you know, joining this event.

305
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:14,170
Just because like, you know, they're giving up their very own time to participate in this.

306
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:15,490
There's like nobody's getting paid.

307
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:17,870
Other than the broadcast staff because I promised them.

308
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:21,690
Because I felt like, you know, since the main broadcast is on my channel.

309
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:23,990
I told the broadcast staff like any amount...

310
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:25,050
Any of the donations.

311
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:30,750
The Super Chats that come in during the event will be split between the broadcast staff.

312
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,150
Just because it's fair.

313
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:35,590
And I might put in a little extra as well.

314
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:39,430
Because I feel like, you know, they're giving up their time to be there to cast.

315
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:41,290
To participate as the announcer.

316
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:43,330
To do the interview and stuff like that.

317
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:46,870
So, I'll be giving them some of the earnings from the event.

318
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:48,570
Anyway, the rules!

319
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:51,450
One of the things you guys might be wondering.

320
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:52,730
The rules!

321
00:15:54,610 --> 00:15:57,670
Basically, I talked about the rules a little bit already.

322
00:15:57,870 --> 00:16:00,930
So, let me just reiterate some of it.

323
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:02,770
Alright, let me...

324
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:03,830
Rules!

325
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:06,530
So, the official hashtag!

326
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:08,250
As you guys all saw.

327
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:09,450
Let me shimmy over here.

328
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:10,210
There you go.

329
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,350
Let me shimmy over.

330
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:21,090
So, the official hashtag is WrestleTuber2024.

331
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:23,730
So, you can use this hashtag.

332
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:28,510
To submit your wrestlers, illustrations, and Latwee!

333
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:33,730
The event will be held on May 25th and 26th.

334
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:34,790
So, Saturday and Sunday.

335
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:35,310
If you're in NA.

336
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:38,430
Saturday and Sunday at 4pm PST.

337
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:40,810
There will also be...

338
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:42,190
This is going to be a new addition.

339
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:43,570
But show matches.

340
00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:46,050
So, for those who couldn't...

341
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:49,210
For some of the VTubers, obviously, they couldn't commit their full time.

342
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:50,990
Because, you know, we don't know when they're going to be eliminated.

343
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:56,090
Like, that is the whole randomness of this whole event.

344
00:16:56,210 --> 00:16:58,190
We don't know when they're going to be eliminated.

345
00:16:58,530 --> 00:17:01,590
So, we gave an option for the participants.

346
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:03,230
To basically...

347
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:05,830
We gave an option for the participants.

348
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:09,450
To basically decide if they want to show up at the show matches.

349
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:11,510
Which will be in the beginning of each day.

350
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:14,070
And each of those participants that chose the show match.

351
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:16,550
Will only have to participate for one match.

352
00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:18,790
And it will be like, maybe cage matches.

353
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:19,950
Or tag team.

354
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:21,250
And we don't...

355
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:24,610
It will be announced during the event.

356
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:25,370
The main broadcast.

357
00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:28,150
So, that will be like a surprise for the audience.

358
00:17:28,330 --> 00:17:30,090
As to what the show match is going to be.

359
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:32,930
So, there is two formats for this.

360
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:33,790
Tournament run.

361
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:36,650
Obviously, it's like the full on tournament structure.

362
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:39,830
So, obviously, you know.

363
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:41,450
They go until they're eliminated.

364
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:44,170
And that is why it runs for two days.

365
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:46,370
Because it is very long.

366
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:51,930
I originally had a hard cap.

367
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:55,830
But then like we got beyond the hard cap.

368
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:56,710
So...

369
00:17:57,730 --> 00:18:00,890
So, it ended up not being a hard cap anymore.

370
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:01,770
So...

371
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:03,150
Because I...

372
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:06,210
Because there is some last minute additions in there.

373
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:08,750
And I was like, fuck it.

374
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:09,590
Let them in.

375
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:14,530
Anyway, as I said before.

376
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:18,030
The wrestlers will be CPU controlled.

377
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:21,630
But all participants will be there.

378
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:24,910
For interviews and or broadcast staff.

379
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:26,990
So, until they're eliminated type deal.

380
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:28,910
So, they will be like showing up on stream.

381
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:30,750
Doing the interviews.

382
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:32,490
And like roasting each other.

383
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:33,470
All of that stuff.

384
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:36,370
So, they will be there in some way.

385
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:41,370
Main broadcast will be on this channel.

386
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:45,350
But some participants will stream their own wrestling creation.

387
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:46,650
Before the event.

388
00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:48,010
So, some of them will be there.

389
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:49,050
And some of them have decided to...

390
00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:51,350
Have chosen to create their own wrestler.

391
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:54,710
And they will be making that wrestler themselves.

392
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:56,530
On the stream for the fans to watch.

393
00:18:56,830 --> 00:18:58,710
And like I said before.

394
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:01,350
This will be an event that unites VTubers from different backgrounds.

395
00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:03,150
Whether indie or company.

396
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:05,050
And represent the spirit of VTubing.

397
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:07,830
Because like I wanted to do an event.

398
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:11,210
I feel like we are very lacking this in the western VTuber side.

399
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:15,970
There's a lot of events that combines like VTubing and like fleshies together.

400
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:17,750
But like there's not a lot of event.

401
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:20,010
That combines like VTubing from different companies.

402
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:21,530
Or indies.

403
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:25,650
Together to participate in something big.

404
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:27,090
A great fun event.

405
00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:29,910
And this was something I wanted to do.

406
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:31,870
And we see a lot of that in Japan.

407
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:36,470
But we don't really see that much in like the western side.

408
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:39,890
And that was like my goal in doing this.

409
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:40,790
Anyway guys.

410
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:44,410
Before I show the second rules page.

411
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,570
I feel like a lot of guys want to know.

412
00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:48,530
Who are on the teams.

413
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:50,790
When I show you guys the teams.

414
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:52,350
Who are always on a team.

415
00:19:52,410 --> 00:19:52,550
Sorry.

416
00:19:52,610 --> 00:19:54,690
The participating members.

417
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:57,490
So there's actually two slides.

418
00:19:57,490 --> 00:19:58,770
To the participating members.

419
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:01,290
But I'll show the first slide.

420
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:02,850
I'll be showing the first slide first.

421
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:03,370
Obviously.

422
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:05,110
Because there was a lot of them.

423
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:08,310
I think we have 29 people.

424
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:11,130
29 participants in total.

425
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:15,610
Obviously like there was originally a super.

426
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:20,110
There was originally a super hard cap.

427
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:25,750
But it ended up going beyond that.

428
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:38,540
So that's why we had 29 in the end.

429
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:46,360
But not all 29 wrestlers will be doing the tournament structure.

430
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:48,880
Some of them will be doing the tournament structure.

431
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:50,320
Some of them will be in show matches.

432
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:53,240
So that's why you must be like 29.

433
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,960
That's not even enough for the tournament.

434
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:57,860
But that's because not all 29 of them.

435
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:58,820
Are going to be in the tournament.

436
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:02,180
Some of them are just going to be participating in the show match.

437
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,080
And like I said earlier.

438
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:04,880
If you don't see your Oshii.

439
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:05,680
If you don't see your VTuber.

440
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:06,140
I'm really sorry.

441
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:10,900
There was a lot of interest.

442
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:12,660
And at that point.

443
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:17,820
I also didn't want to have too many from one sector.

444
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:18,880
So like.

445
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,120
And obviously.

446
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,600
Some obviously in other areas.

447
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:24,920
There might not be a lot of interest was there.

448
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:26,100
Regarding that.

449
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:29,620
So there was a lot of interest in certain companies.

450
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:32,400
And there was a lot of interest within the indie sphere.

451
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:34,600
But I tried to balance it.

452
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,980
As best as I could.

453
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:42,540
And then obviously there were moments where like.

454
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:44,840
Some of the companies had their own events.

455
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,060
During this time.

456
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:48,060
Or like during that date.

457
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,880
And because of that.

458
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:52,480
They weren't able to participate.

459
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,880
Some VTubers that wanted to participate.

460
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:55,780
Couldn't participate.

461
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:58,180
Due to the overlap in the schedule.

462
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:00,260
So within like.

463
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:01,300
Either company wise.

464
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:05,240
Or just like within their own individual schedule.

465
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:06,180
Anyway.

466
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:07,560
Teams time.

467
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:09,940
It's teams time.

468
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:12,040
Wow.

469
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:13,740
Alright.

470
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:15,760
So this is slide number one.

471
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:18,120
I need you guys to know.

472
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:20,360
Like I said.

473
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,660
I reached out.

474
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,660
To a bunch of companies.

475
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:27,140
Because I really wanted to.

476
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,380
I reached out to a bunch of companies.

477
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,300
And I said like.

478
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,780
Okay there is a limit to how many.

479
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,720
Per company can send.

480
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:38,420
And obviously.

481
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,180
I really wanted to reach out to.

482
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,110
Like xprismproject.

483
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,260
To participate in this.

484
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:46,640
In this event.

485
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,480
Because of everything that happened.

486
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:48,860
So I wanted to.

487
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,940
So I reached out to one of the members.

488
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,540
In xprismproject.

489
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,300
And asked if they wanted to be in.

490
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:56,980
In WrestleTuber.

491
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:58,720
I'm really happy to have.

492
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:00,700
There was actually a lot of interest.

493
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,800
But unfortunately we had to cap it.

494
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,060
As I said.

495
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:05,000
Because I didn't want to have.

496
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,960
Spread it out more evenly.

497
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:10,700
Amongst the.

498
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,240
Amongst the participants.

499
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,740
Regarding like which.

500
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:15,260
Which.

501
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:17,180
Like how many.

502
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:18,740
Can each company send.

503
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,500
So there was a hard limit.

504
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:21,240
For each company.

505
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,440
So like I said.

506
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:27,340
There are the participants in xprismproject.

507
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,040
Nia.

508
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:29,420

512
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:32,960
And Non.

513
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:34,840
And then in vshowjo.

514
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:36,160
We have Xentreya.

515
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,940
For the indies.

516
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:39,380
We have Sayu.

517
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:39,680
Fillion.

518
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:40,620
Buffpuff.

519
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:41,040
Me.

520
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:41,880
ShyLily.

521
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:42,940
Limeu.

522
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:43,760
Merryweather.

523
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:44,360
Snuffy.

524
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,560
And Neurosama.

525
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:47,840
So this is.

526
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,760
There's a slide two guys.

527
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:51,120
There's a slide two.

528
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:52,360
Because we have 29.

529
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:59,080
There's a slide two.

530
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,920
And I got what's in slide two.

531
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:08,720
Okay.

532
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:13,840
I'm like even I'm anxious.

533
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:18,720
Even I'm fucking anxious.

534
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:19,580
On slide two.

535
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:20,860
But anyway.

536
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,520
Here is slide two.

537
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,560
So we have Idol EN.

538
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,680
FaZe Connect.

539
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,220
And Holostars.

540
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:31,240
Participating.

541
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,400
And I need you guys to know.

542
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:33,120
Axel.

543
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,640
I was talking to Axel.

544
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:38,800
Holostars was actually the last minute edition.

545
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,980
They joined the server.

546
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:43,080
I think three days ago.

547
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:44,100
And I had to.

548
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,980
Not redo everything.

549
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:49,320
But I had to scrounge up a lot of stuff.

550
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,120
So.

551
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,080
So.

552
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,640
Huge shout out to Axel.

553
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:57,700
For helping me with this.

554
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:58,760
Because I asked him.

555
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:01,060
I'm organizing WrestleTuber.

556
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,480
Here are the details of WrestleTuber.

557
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:05,900
I was wondering if you guys are interested.

558
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:06,140
So.

559
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:08,060
Obviously you guys don't have to join.

560
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,360
It's just a little fun thing I'm doing.

561
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:11,760
But there's going to be a lot of people from different areas.

562
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:13,240
In B-Tubing.

563
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:14,080
And then.

564
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:17,360
Axel got back to me and was like.

565
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:17,840
Oh my gosh.

566
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:18,900
So many of the boys are interested.

567
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:19,580
And I was like.

568
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:19,820
Yeah.

569
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:21,520
Bring people to join in.

570
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:22,360
And then.

571
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:24,060
So anyway.

572
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:26,820
Holostars was actually.

573
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:30,060
The last minute entry.

574
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:31,980
Into WrestleTuber.

575
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,000
And so we have a lot of people.

576
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,060
After the last Holostars member got into the server.

577
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:38,920
I was like.

578
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:39,140
Alright.

579
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:39,580
We're capping.

580
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:43,940
I was like.

581
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:44,780
Okay.

582
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:45,120
We are.

583
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,800
We gotta hard cap this now.

584
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:52,760
So.

585
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:57,680
But yes.

586
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:58,180
It was.

587
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:00,860
So we have Holostars.

588
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:01,840
We have.

589
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:04,020
Axel.

590
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:05,740
Haka.

591
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:07,380
Beto.

592
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:08,820
Gerard.

593
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:09,360
Octavia.

594
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:10,540
Goldbullet.

595
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:12,180
And Shinri from Holostars.

596
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:13,540
In Idol EN.

597
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:14,860
We have Juna.

598
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:15,380
Fuyo.

599
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:15,760
Kai.

600
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:16,320
And Rin.

601
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:17,420
And finally.

602
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,520
In FaZe Connect.

603
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:20,260
We have Saya and Remilia.

604
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:21,860
So these are.

605
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:24,340
The 29 participants.

606
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:26,600
That will be participating.

607
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:28,360
In WrestleTuber.

608
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:29,520
Like I said before.

609
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,040
I'm really sorry.

610
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:30,380
We don't see.

611
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:32,620
Either Oshii or VTuber.

612
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,500
We really wanted to be in WrestleTuber.

613
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,920
It was very hard to like.

614
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:39,040
It was very hard.

615
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:40,020
To like.

616
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,100
Limit participants.

617
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:42,140
As well as like.

618
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,480
When we came to sending out invites and stuff.

619
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,400
At one point we sent out invites.

620
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,000
To certain VTubers.

621
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:49,380
But.

622
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,480
Because they were very busy.

623
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:54,140
They weren't able to reply back in time.

624
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,740
Or like the invite got lost.

625
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:58,800
So there were some.

626
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,840
There was also some VTubers.

627
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:02,580
That originally.

628
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:03,860
Were able to participate.

629
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:05,860
But because we had to change the date.

630
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:06,660
Last minute.

631
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:09,820
We had some VTubers.

632
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:11,120
That couldn't participate.

633
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:14,000
Due to the change of the date.

634
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:14,600
So.

635
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:17,280
And of course.

636
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:18,500
There was also like.

637
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:19,040
Obviously.

638
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:20,360
We had limited spots.

639
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:21,860
And because of that.

640
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,000
We had to.

641
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:24,340
Well I had to.

642
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:24,740
Because like.

643
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:26,240
I'm the sole organizer.

644
00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:31,770
I am.

645
00:27:31,770 --> 00:27:32,990
I am the sole organizer.

646
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:33,710
So I.

647
00:27:34,170 --> 00:27:35,350
Made the decision.

648
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:36,290
With myself.

649
00:27:36,610 --> 00:27:37,270
The board.

650
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:38,350
Which is myself.

651
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:41,050
That.

652
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:42,630
That.

653
00:27:43,650 --> 00:27:44,850
Regarding like.

654
00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:47,070
Regarding like.

655
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:47,750
Who can.

656
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:48,630
And like.

657
00:27:48,870 --> 00:27:49,470
When.

658
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:51,390
Who to invite.

659
00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:52,050
And like.

660
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:53,710
Oh what do we do with this.

661
00:27:53,850 --> 00:27:54,450
The board.

662
00:27:54,530 --> 00:27:55,450
As in me.

663
00:27:55,450 --> 00:27:57,110
And me only.

664
00:27:58,570 --> 00:28:00,610
The Doki board.

665
00:28:00,810 --> 00:28:02,190
I am the senate.

666
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:02,910
Anyway.

667
00:28:03,010 --> 00:28:03,970
Now you guys are wondering.

668
00:28:04,090 --> 00:28:05,070
Who is on.

669
00:28:05,090 --> 00:28:06,810
The broadcast staff.

670
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:09,010
So on the broadcast staff.

671
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:10,250
We have.

672
00:28:11,670 --> 00:28:13,350
The interviewer.

673
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:14,950
Will be Juna.

674
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:17,910
Juna Unagi from Idol EN.

675
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:19,310
The announcer.

676
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:21,430
Will be Sayu.

677
00:28:21,770 --> 00:28:23,350
The casters.

678
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:24,970
Will be me.

679
00:28:25,450 --> 00:28:25,970
Snuffy.

680
00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:27,790
Octavio.

681
00:28:28,010 --> 00:28:29,490
And Gold Bullet.

682
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:31,350
So that is.

683
00:28:31,630 --> 00:28:34,130
The broadcast staff team.

684
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:36,730
For the 25th.

685
00:28:36,770 --> 00:28:38,930
And the 26th.

686
00:28:38,930 --> 00:28:39,870
I'm so sorry.

687
00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:43,070
I'm like blocking you.

688
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:48,190
Here is.

689
00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:50,870
Here is the broadcast staff.

690
00:28:51,170 --> 00:28:52,610
Just so you guys know.

691
00:28:52,670 --> 00:28:53,550
For the casters.

692
00:28:55,450 --> 00:28:55,650
We are going to be like.

693
00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:57,350
All of us are just going to be on the casting table.

694
00:28:57,550 --> 00:29:00,030
The reason why the casting table.

695
00:29:00,870 --> 00:29:01,310
Is.

696
00:29:01,910 --> 00:29:03,630
There is a lot of people in the casting.

697
00:29:04,970 --> 00:29:05,730
Broadcasting table.

698
00:29:05,930 --> 00:29:07,010
Is so that we can.

699
00:29:07,730 --> 00:29:09,810
Basically mix and match in between.

700
00:29:10,910 --> 00:29:12,370
So because of that.

701
00:29:12,610 --> 00:29:13,990
It allows us to like.

702
00:29:14,290 --> 00:29:15,290
We don't have like.

703
00:29:15,410 --> 00:29:15,670
One.

704
00:29:15,870 --> 00:29:16,310
Two.

705
00:29:16,410 --> 00:29:18,510
Like all of us don't have the fucking cast.

706
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:19,690
All the way through.

707
00:29:19,690 --> 00:29:21,250
We can take breaks in between.

708
00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:24,090
And like mix and match.

709
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:25,470
The combinations.

710
00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:27,270
Of the casters.

711
00:29:27,530 --> 00:29:28,270
So like.

712
00:29:30,050 --> 00:29:31,170
And so like.

713
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:33,270
It allows us to rest a bit in between.

714
00:29:33,370 --> 00:29:34,130
And take breaks.

715
00:29:34,290 --> 00:29:35,950
Because that was like one of the things I realized.

716
00:29:36,090 --> 00:29:40,070
That having a small pool of casters.

717
00:29:40,150 --> 00:29:41,390
Is not really like the best.

718
00:29:41,690 --> 00:29:43,550
Because like what if we want to take a break.

719
00:29:43,690 --> 00:29:44,450
And it's very long.

720
00:29:44,630 --> 00:29:46,130
The thing is this is a very.

721
00:29:46,130 --> 00:29:47,810
This is going to be a very long event.

722
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:49,990
Due to how many participants there are.

723
00:29:50,390 --> 00:29:50,710
So.

724
00:29:52,930 --> 00:29:56,550
So it's good to be able to mix and match the casters.

725
00:29:56,650 --> 00:29:57,690
Because in the end.

726
00:29:57,750 --> 00:30:00,190
I remember I had like set casters for like certain days.

727
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:01,950
But for this one.

728
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:03,750
We're going to be mixing in between.

729
00:30:03,910 --> 00:30:05,630
It's not going to be mixed every match or so.

730
00:30:05,810 --> 00:30:07,970
Like maybe like this combination will do like.

731
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:09,350
Three to four.

732
00:30:09,530 --> 00:30:10,110
Like two.

733
00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:11,330
Three to four matches.

734
00:30:11,630 --> 00:30:12,690
And then you know.

735
00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:14,230
And then like later on.

736
00:30:14,290 --> 00:30:16,450
We go in with a new combination.

737
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:17,870
For three to four matches.

738
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:21,050
And that is how it's going to be.

739
00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:22,250
Also finally.

740
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:22,970
Credits.

741
00:30:24,650 --> 00:30:25,430
We have.

742
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:27,250
This might be a very familiar team.

743
00:30:27,810 --> 00:30:29,270
Because I love working with these people.

744
00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:31,690
When I do like projects and events.

745
00:30:31,850 --> 00:30:33,830
I tend to work with the same people.

746
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:35,170
Because they know what I like.

747
00:30:35,290 --> 00:30:36,030
They know what I want.

748
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:39,130
And I know they do a really good job.

749
00:30:39,890 --> 00:30:41,090
So like I said.

750
00:30:42,690 --> 00:30:44,750
The logo was done by.

751
00:30:45,330 --> 00:30:45,910
SSSugarType.

752
00:30:46,730 --> 00:30:48,670
You see here the WrestleTuber.

753
00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:51,010
The belt will be designed.

754
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:51,770
By Melly.

755
00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:54,890
We will be showing you guys the design of the belt.

756
00:30:54,990 --> 00:30:56,190
At a later stage.

757
00:30:57,690 --> 00:30:59,090
At a later stage.

758
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:00,270
Of the.

759
00:31:01,330 --> 00:31:02,670
Like when it gets closer.

760
00:31:02,670 --> 00:31:03,410
To the event.

761
00:31:03,870 --> 00:31:05,930
When it gets closer to the event.

762
00:31:06,010 --> 00:31:07,410
The belt design will be shown.

763
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:09,790
There will be multiple belts.

764
00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:11,170
Why multiple?

765
00:31:12,690 --> 00:31:13,470
Because the show matches.

766
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:15,970
Will also be sent a belt.

767
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:17,930
So the winners of the show matches.

768
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:19,590
Will get their own belt as well.

769
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:21,350
As well as the tournament.

770
00:31:22,910 --> 00:31:24,690
And like I said.

771
00:31:25,170 --> 00:31:26,650
Everybody that participates.

772
00:31:26,670 --> 00:31:28,710
Will get like a little gift.

773
00:31:28,790 --> 00:31:30,130
And souvenir from me.

774
00:31:30,510 --> 00:31:32,110
To thank them for participating.

775
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:33,970
So everybody gets something.

776
00:31:35,030 --> 00:31:36,150
And GamerSubs.

777
00:31:36,210 --> 00:31:38,490
Will be sponsoring all of this.

778
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:41,550
So GamerSubs is paying for all the gifts.

779
00:31:41,690 --> 00:31:42,590
As well as the belts.

780
00:31:42,690 --> 00:31:43,610
The graphics.

781
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:46,970
Basically anything that.

782
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:48,590
That needs to be paid.

783
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:49,530
For this event.

784
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:52,290
Is paid for by GamerSubs.

785
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:53,950
So huge shout out to them.

786
00:31:54,290 --> 00:31:55,810
Because like it's a lot of stuff.

787
00:31:59,850 --> 00:32:00,950
It's actually crazy.

788
00:32:00,970 --> 00:32:01,870
The amount of support.

789
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:03,450
For my very first.

790
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:04,970
Big event.

791
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:06,290
And finally.

792
00:32:06,810 --> 00:32:07,410
OniPilot.

793
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:09,410
For designing all the graphics.

794
00:32:09,410 --> 00:32:10,530
That you see here.

795
00:32:11,950 --> 00:32:12,990
For WrestleTuber.

796
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:13,870
Yay!

797
00:32:15,630 --> 00:32:16,150
Alright.

798
00:32:16,370 --> 00:32:16,890
Rules.

799
00:32:18,610 --> 00:32:19,930
It's not over yet guys.

800
00:32:20,170 --> 00:32:21,110
It's not over yet.

801
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:23,890
Because we still have the matchups that we have to do.

802
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:25,470
The brackets scenario.

803
00:32:26,090 --> 00:32:28,890
And the rules 2 and 3.

804
00:32:29,210 --> 00:32:30,650
Almost forgot to show you guys.

805
00:32:30,710 --> 00:32:31,810
Rules 2 and 3.

806
00:32:34,170 --> 00:32:34,690
Alright.

807
00:32:34,690 --> 00:32:35,650
Alright.

808
00:32:35,810 --> 00:32:37,430
Rules 2 and 3.

809
00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:38,550
Where's rules 2?

810
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:39,970
Alright rules 2.

811
00:32:41,610 --> 00:32:42,290
Uh.

812
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:45,250
Wrestlers will be created.

813
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:48,370
In WWE 2K24.

814
00:32:48,730 --> 00:32:49,770
The deadline.

815
00:32:49,890 --> 00:32:50,970
For the wrestler submission.

816
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:53,450
Will be May 24th.

817
00:32:53,530 --> 00:32:56,090
So it's the day before the event.

818
00:32:56,390 --> 00:32:56,810
Um.

819
00:32:56,910 --> 00:33:00,810
It's for both the VTubers that are creating the wrestlers.

820
00:33:00,910 --> 00:33:02,730
And for the fan submissions.

821
00:33:03,030 --> 00:33:04,270
So just remember.

822
00:33:04,690 --> 00:33:05,510
Like uh.

823
00:33:05,730 --> 00:33:06,570
If you're making.

824
00:33:06,730 --> 00:33:10,270
I will be giving a list of the VTubers.

825
00:33:10,290 --> 00:33:13,530
That will be using your fan submission wrestler.

826
00:33:13,970 --> 00:33:14,510
Uh.

827
00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:17,910
And the deadline will be May 24th.

828
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:18,970
The wrestlers.

829
00:33:18,970 --> 00:33:20,610
Have to be male.

830
00:33:20,890 --> 00:33:22,910
So that they can all wrestle each other.

831
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:24,470
In the tournament.

832
00:33:24,730 --> 00:33:25,290
So.

833
00:33:25,810 --> 00:33:27,470
They have to be male.

834
00:33:28,050 --> 00:33:29,770
Just cause like that's the only way.

835
00:33:29,850 --> 00:33:31,950
There's no like in the tournament structure.

836
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:34,250
You can't put like female male wrestlers together.

837
00:33:34,410 --> 00:33:35,770
So we have to decide.

838
00:33:35,870 --> 00:33:37,670
Like it has to be all male.

839
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:38,970
Uh for stats.

840
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:39,330
Whoa!

841
00:33:39,490 --> 00:33:41,550
Sorry I forgot to lock myself in.

842
00:33:41,670 --> 00:33:42,090
For.

843
00:33:44,930 --> 00:33:46,030
For stats.

844
00:33:46,490 --> 00:33:48,450
Please have the attributes.

845
00:33:48,490 --> 00:33:50,140
Have an overall range.

846
00:33:51,170 --> 00:33:52,410
Of 85.

847
00:33:52,910 --> 00:33:55,150
It has to be 85.

848
00:33:55,590 --> 00:33:56,790
It can't be 84.

849
00:33:57,050 --> 00:33:58,310
It can't be 86.

850
00:33:58,610 --> 00:34:00,850
It has to be 85.

851
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:01,930
It has to be 85.

852
00:34:01,950 --> 00:34:03,990
So when you're doing all your stats configuration.

853
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:05,590
85.

854
00:34:05,850 --> 00:34:08,150
Has to be the overall stat.

855
00:34:09,070 --> 00:34:10,770
When uploading your wrestler.

856
00:34:11,010 --> 00:34:13,150
Please use these tags.

857
00:34:14,650 --> 00:34:15,290
WrestleTuber2024.

858
00:34:15,990 --> 00:34:16,630
VTubers.

859
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:19,030
VTWWE.

860
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:20,430
And like I said.

861
00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:21,950
WWE 2K24.

862
00:34:22,910 --> 00:34:25,110
This is the game that we will be using.

863
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:26,430
For the tournament structure.

864
00:34:26,810 --> 00:34:28,530
We will be using the steam version.

865
00:34:28,770 --> 00:34:29,810
With all the DLC.

866
00:34:30,210 --> 00:34:31,930
You don't have to have the DLC.

867
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:36,890
If you're creating your wrestler.

868
00:34:37,130 --> 00:34:38,630
But like if you have the DLC.

869
00:34:38,730 --> 00:34:39,510
It's just more customization.

870
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:41,690
So like I'll be using the DLC.

871
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:43,330
For those who are using the DLC.

872
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:44,930
Just in case like you know.

873
00:34:44,950 --> 00:34:45,890
Like if I don't have it.

874
00:34:45,890 --> 00:34:47,030
We won't be able to download the wrestler.

875
00:34:47,270 --> 00:34:49,390
So I'll be using all the DLC.

876
00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:51,550
So you can go wild with your customization.

877
00:34:52,330 --> 00:34:52,730
Finally.

878
00:34:52,770 --> 00:34:54,610
When you're customizing your wrestler.

879
00:34:54,810 --> 00:34:56,430
Don't worry I will be posting the rules.

880
00:34:56,790 --> 00:34:57,810
On Twitter later.

881
00:34:58,050 --> 00:34:59,210
So do not worry if you're like.

882
00:34:59,290 --> 00:34:59,670
Oh my god.

883
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:00,550
I can't write all this down.

884
00:35:01,950 --> 00:35:02,210
I'm so impatient.

885
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:02,890
What am I gonna do?

886
00:35:06,090 --> 00:35:07,310
It's way too much information.

887
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:08,130
Oh my god.

888
00:35:08,170 --> 00:35:09,370
I can't write this down in time.

889
00:35:12,850 --> 00:35:13,910
These are the things.

890
00:35:13,950 --> 00:35:14,650
You need to customize.

891
00:35:16,130 --> 00:35:17,650
The streamers that are making their wrestler.

892
00:35:17,770 --> 00:35:18,650
Will also know that these.

893
00:35:18,790 --> 00:35:19,670
I set up a guide.

894
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:20,870
I made like a step by step guide.

895
00:35:21,090 --> 00:35:22,430
For everybody on how to customize.

896
00:35:22,830 --> 00:35:23,710
And stuff for.

897
00:35:23,770 --> 00:35:24,690
Well not for you guys.

898
00:35:24,810 --> 00:35:25,790
I assume you guys already know.

899
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:28,090
But like a lot of the people that joined this.

900
00:35:28,090 --> 00:35:31,710
They haven't played WWE 2K24 yet.

901
00:35:31,850 --> 00:35:32,650
So like they didn't know.

902
00:35:32,690 --> 00:35:34,110
Like how to create their custom wrestler.

903
00:35:34,330 --> 00:35:36,110
So I basically like wrote a.

904
00:35:36,170 --> 00:35:37,510
Step by step guide for everybody.

905
00:35:37,810 --> 00:35:38,650
In the server.

906
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:39,730
Regarding like.

907
00:35:39,850 --> 00:35:40,610
How to do this.

908
00:35:41,590 --> 00:35:42,070
Anyway.

909
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:44,650
Uniformly customize the superstar.

910
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:46,090
Entrance.

911
00:35:47,330 --> 00:35:47,810
Victory.

912
00:35:47,810 --> 00:35:49,330
And moveset.

913
00:35:49,850 --> 00:35:51,650
Video is not required.

914
00:35:52,410 --> 00:35:53,570
It's not mandatory.

915
00:35:54,050 --> 00:35:55,290
But if you do it.

916
00:35:55,310 --> 00:35:55,870
It'll be funny.

917
00:35:55,870 --> 00:35:58,090
Because like you can put any video in the backdrop.

918
00:35:58,590 --> 00:35:59,050
Obviously.

919
00:35:59,310 --> 00:36:01,830
It has to be like if you're gonna do a video in the backdrop.

920
00:36:01,830 --> 00:36:03,230
Please make it TOS friendly.

921
00:36:08,350 --> 00:36:10,170
Especially the fan submission.

922
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:13,330
As long.

923
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:16,170
As it's TOS friendly.

924
00:36:16,350 --> 00:36:16,910
It's fine.

925
00:36:19,390 --> 00:36:22,030
That's all I asked for it.

926
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:22,390
Now.

927
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:22,910
Now.

928
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:24,430
Rules number 3.

929
00:36:25,870 --> 00:36:27,390
Who will be creating their wrestler on stream.

930
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:29,090
And who will be using.

931
00:36:29,130 --> 00:36:30,830
Fan submitted wrestlers.

932
00:36:31,470 --> 00:36:32,550
Rules 3.

933
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:33,470
Alright.

934
00:36:34,950 --> 00:36:36,630
So these are the people.

935
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:39,610
That will be making their wrestler on stream.

936
00:36:39,890 --> 00:36:40,950
So you might be seeing.

937
00:36:41,270 --> 00:36:43,430
You might notice that I also gave like.

938
00:36:43,490 --> 00:36:45,410
2 weeks leeway this time around.

939
00:36:45,550 --> 00:36:46,410
Instead of 1 week.

940
00:36:47,270 --> 00:36:48,550
Because I felt like.

941
00:36:49,590 --> 00:36:51,470
1 week was too short.

942
00:36:55,870 --> 00:36:57,610
1 week was.

943
00:36:59,290 --> 00:36:59,890
Honestly.

944
00:37:00,950 --> 00:37:02,750
Way too short.

945
00:37:03,030 --> 00:37:03,590
So.

946
00:37:03,670 --> 00:37:06,270
That's why like people who are making their own wrestler.

947
00:37:07,270 --> 00:37:08,590
They can have.

948
00:37:08,850 --> 00:37:10,390
It's easier to schedule.

949
00:37:10,430 --> 00:37:11,170
For everybody.

950
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:12,270
So.

951
00:37:12,950 --> 00:37:15,370
So we gave everyone 2 weeks.

952
00:37:15,390 --> 00:37:16,950
To create their own wrestler.

953
00:37:17,210 --> 00:37:19,470
So here are the people that are making it on stream.

954
00:37:20,090 --> 00:37:22,910

00:37:35,890 --> 00:37:38,010

They will be picking the wrestler.

991
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:46,540
To represent themselves.

992
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:48,260
So like you know obviously.

993
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:50,560

Maybe someone.

997
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:55,480
Cause like I let them pick the wrestler that they want to represent them.

998
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:57,200
So maybe they'll be like.

999
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:58,840

00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:05,560
Try to see what you think they would want.

1005
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,820
Cause some of them will actually be talking on stream.

1006
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:10,320
About what kind of wrestler they want to represent them.

1007
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:11,060
So.

1008
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:14,880
I know like Buffpuffpuffpuff Was gonna talk on stream.

1009
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:17,100
About like oh what kind of wrestler she.

1010
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:18,500
They wanna see.

1011
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:19,540
And then.

1012
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:21,900
And then.

1013
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:24,260
And I know like several other streamers.

1014
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,540
Are gonna be doing that as well.

1015
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:27,200
So maybe take some notes.

1016
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:28,560
And see what they decide.

1017
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,880
They wanna see to have a wrestler.

1018
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:32,740
Represent them.

1019
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:33,920
Alright.

1020
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:36,340
It's time.

1021
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:37,880
It's fucking time.

1022
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:40,060
It's match up time.

1023
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:43,240
So I realized there was one thing I did miss.

1024
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,780
Which was to let you guys know.

1025
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:48,020
Who will be participating in the show matches.

1026
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:50,000
And who will be participating.

1027
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:51,140
In the tournament.

1028
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:53,680
And actually I'll just like read out the list.

1029
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:55,700
Of the show matches to you right now.

1030
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:56,920
Because I didn't write it down.

1031
00:39:58,660 --> 00:39:59,920
I knew I forgot.

1032
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:01,140
To write down something.

1033
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:06,040
So.

1034
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:09,880
These are people that will be only participating.

1035
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:11,780
In the show matches.

1036
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:13,360
As in they'll only be there.

1037
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,100
For the beginning.

1038
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,160
For one match.

1039
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:18,540
And then they'll have to do the scheduling.

1040
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:20,520
Like I said a lot of this is due to scheduling.

1041
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:22,640
Like you know for some.

1042
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:24,320
It's like some people are in EU.

1043
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:25,900
So they couldn't stay up for too long.

1044
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:28,540
Because like we don't know when this is gonna end.

1045
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:29,580
So they're like oh yeah.

1046
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:30,460
Like at this point.

1047
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:31,260
Like they're like oh yeah.

1048
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:33,140
I don't know if I can stay up for that long.

1049
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,740
So I'll be there for the beginning.

1050
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:35,500
For the show matches.

1051
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:37,740
Or just like it was just like time constraints.

1052
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:38,400
And scheduling.

1053
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,980
So some of you chose the show matches.

1054
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,360
The participants in show matches.

1055
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:45,320
Will be.

1056
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:53,180
Nirosama, Merryweather, Buffpuff, Goldbullet, Zentreya, And ShyLily.

1057
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:56,280
We have 6 wrestlers.

1058
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:58,500
That will only be there for the show matches.

1059
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:00,260
Also.

1060
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:02,120
Per tradition at the very end.

1061
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:03,940
We will have a.

1062
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:05,500
Free for all wrestling.

1063
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:10,560
Free for all wrestling event.

1064
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:12,160
With everybody in the end.

1065
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:13,900
For like the ultimate wrestler.

1066
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,540
So we will be include.

1067
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:17,040
They might not be there.

1068
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:20,060
In the call.

1069
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:20,960
When this happens.

1070
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:22,740
But they will be there spiritually.

1071
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:26,560
Because we'll throw them in.

1072
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:27,740
For the free for all.

1073
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:28,920
Um.

1074
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:30,180
Anyway.

1075
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:33,600
It's time for the brackets.

1076
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:36,100
Oh my gosh.

1077
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:37,280
It's been so long since I did like announcements.

1078
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:39,740
Since I did like.

1079
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:40,860
Announcement streams.

1080
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:44,440
Yeah.

1081
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:46,040
Alright.

1082
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:47,300
I'm pulling up the wheel.

1083
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:50,120
One of the things that I wasn't able to make in time.

1084
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:50,600
Was like.

1085
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:51,500
I actually made like.

1086
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:53,820
A like.

1087
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:54,540
A text.

1088
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:57,040
Like the text in OBS.

1089
00:41:57,060 --> 00:41:58,940
For everybody's names that are in the tournament.

1090
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:00,640
But I didn't manage to make that in time.

1091
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,020
I only managed to make one name.

1092
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:05,460
So we're doing it live.

1093
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:09,920
There will be no.

1094
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:11,120
Spinning the wheel.

1095
00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:12,780
For.

1096
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:15,360
There will be no spinning the wheel.

1097
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:17,740
For the show matches.

1098
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:19,860
That will be a surprise for everybody.

1099
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:20,900
Um.

1100
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:23,200
I guess for the wrestlers as well.

1101
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:25,000
So.

1102
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:28,340
So the show matches.

1103
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:29,800
Wrestlers will be a surprise.

1104
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:31,580
As to who is going to be matched up with who.

1105
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:32,960
Because it can be anything.

1106
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,020
It could be cage matches.

1107
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:35,280
It could be tag team.

1108
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:37,000
It could be literally anything.

1109
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:39,140
Because there's so many different types of matches.

1110
00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:42,460
So.

1111
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:43,120
The wheel.

1112
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:44,740
It is.

1113
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:45,580
The wheel.

1114
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:47,300
Um.

1115
00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:48,700
Alright.

1116
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:49,760

1306
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:41,540
She's back to finish the job.

There's a lot of Indie versus Idol EN.

1316
00:48:57,960 --> 00:49:00,000
It's like whoever gets the eye.

1317
00:49:00,180 --> 00:49:00,460
.

1318
00:49:00,460 --> 00:49:03,820
Whoever wins has to get rid of the eye.

1319
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:04,380
.

1320
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:05,880

First matchups.

1326
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:16,960
For day one.

1327
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:18,180
And also.

1328
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:18,500
.

1329
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:19,520

Indie.

00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:30,160
Oh my gosh.

1338
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:31,000
How does it feel like.

1339
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:31,100
.

1340
00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:32,560
Every time I remove more names.

1341
00:49:32,740 --> 00:49:32,980
.

1342
00:49:32,980 --> 00:49:34,740
It feels like there's still so many.

1343
00:49:35,140 --> 00:49:35,620
.

1344
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:37,560

.

1347
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,500
Is Snuffy going to win that pot of gold?

1348
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:43,120
.

1349
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:45,420
Or is Fuyo going to run over.

1350
00:49:45,540 --> 00:49:45,980
.

1351
00:49:45,980 --> 00:49:46,880
And get a roadkill.

1352
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:47,320
.

1353
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:49,300

1363
00:49:57,060 --> 00:49:59,400
For you guys to screenshot the current matchups.

1364
00:49:59,420 --> 00:49:59,520
.

1365
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:01,380
Before I wipe it all.

1366
00:50:01,460 --> 00:50:01,580
.

1367
00:50:01,580 --> 00:50:02,220
Out of existence.

1368
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:02,580
.

1369
00:50:02,580 --> 00:50:03,860
And you can only watch it in the rewind.

1370
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:04,520
.

1371
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:06,420

The next matchup.

1376
00:50:11,260 --> 00:50:11,500
.

1377
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:11,700
.

1378
00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:17,100
And on none.

1379
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:17,640
.

1380
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:18,440
Is the first split.

1381
00:50:18,460 --> 00:50:18,720
.

1382
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:19,460
Next matchup.

1383
00:50:19,700 --> 00:50:20,140

1384
00:50:20,140 --> 00:50:21,080

1385
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:21,320
.

1386
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:22,260
Down real quick.

1387
00:50:23,780 --> 00:50:24,220
way.

1388
00:50:24,220 --> 00:50:24,220
.

1389
00:50:24,220 --> 00:50:25,300
And on none.

1390
00:50:25,580 --> 00:50:25,920
.

1391
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:27,700
Actually guys before I do it.

1392
00:50:27,700 --> 00:50:27,800
.

1393
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:30,660
Can you guys screenshot this for me?

1394
00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:30,820
.

1395
00:50:30,820 --> 00:50:31,120
Real鐘

1396
00:50:35,100 --> 00:50:36,240
When I post.

1397
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:36,420
.

1398
00:50:36,420 --> 00:50:36,780
Actually no.

1399
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:36,920
.

1400
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:37,720
When I post a match.

1401
00:50:37,780 --> 00:50:37,840
.

1402
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:39,840
I'll just Photoshop it.

1403
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:39,980
.

1404
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:40,020
.

1405
00:50:40,020 --> 00:50:40,660
That's actually easier.

1406
00:50:40,980 --> 00:50:41,080
.

1407
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:41,140
.

1408
00:50:41,140 --> 00:50:41,140
.

1409
00:50:41,140 --> 00:50:41,140
.

1410
00:50:41,140 --> 00:50:41,140
.

1411
00:50:41,140 --> 00:50:41,140
.

1412
00:50:41,140 --> 00:50:41,140
.

1413
00:50:41,140 --> 00:50:41,480
,I feel like this is the final match.

1414
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:41,480
, .

1415
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:45,400
Aesthetically, you can just screenshot this for your Twitter post while you're live tweeting.

1416
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:46,200
Uh...

1417
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:47,020
Hahahaha!

1418
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:56,340
And then, for anyone that screenshots this, I can just go like yoink and just take that screenshot and use it for my own tweet.

1419
00:50:56,980 --> 00:50:57,500
Uh...

1420
00:50:57,500 --> 00:50:59,240

1421
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:00,240

00:51:02,820 --> 00:51:04,620

Alright.

1424
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:07,580
Let me just...

1425
00:51:08,780 --> 00:51:11,060
rename... let me copy this folder.

1426
00:51:11,460 --> 00:51:13,360
And then do a duplicate.

1427
00:51:14,300 --> 00:51:15,340
And then...

1428
00:51:15,340 --> 00:51:17,500
Bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup... wait, where am I?

1429
00:51:17,580 --> 00:51:18,160
Okay, here we go.

1430
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:19,220
Redo this.

1431
00:51:19,660 --> 00:51:21,440
Wait, did I duplicate all of this?

1432
00:51:21,740 --> 00:51:22,260
No!

1433
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:23,320
Wait, am I dumb?

1434
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:24,880
Wait, don't answer that chat.

1435
00:51:25,300 --> 00:51:25,820
Hahahaha!

1436
00:51:31,420 --> 00:51:32,680
We're doing it live!

1437
00:51:33,860 --> 00:51:37,480
Despite so many events that I've hosted, I'm somehow...

1438
00:51:37,580 --> 00:51:38,600
still incompetent.

1439
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:39,380
It's actually...

1440
00:51:39,380 --> 00:51:41,460
very impressive at this point.

1441
00:51:41,740 --> 00:51:42,200
Alright.

1442
00:51:42,460 --> 00:51:43,440
Anna Nunn!

1443
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:46,040
Is our first matchup in this bracket.

1444
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:47,140
Next!

1445
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:50,460
Who is Anna Nunn gonna be facing against?

1446
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:53,960
Must tell lies.

1447
00:51:54,760 --> 00:51:55,480
Nya!

1448
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:57,160
Oh my god!

1449
00:51:57,320 --> 00:52:00,820
Is... is X-Prism versus X-Prism?

1450
00:52:00,940 --> 00:52:02,180
Let's fucking go!

1451
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:03,100

00:52:04,460 --> 00:52:04,880
Fight!

1454
00:52:05,020 --> 00:52:05,440
Fight!

1455
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:07,560
I love you!

1456
00:52:07,580 --> 00:52:10,640
I love it when there's infighting and I'm not involved in just watching.

1457
00:52:11,340 --> 00:52:11,920
Hahahaha!

1458
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:15,900
Oh my god!

1459
00:52:16,060 --> 00:52:19,020
At last I can just watch when the infighting starts.

1460
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:21,540
And I don't have to be involved in the drama.

1461
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:22,420
Hahahaha!

1462
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:23,980
Fight!

1463
00:52:24,060 --> 00:52:24,420
Fight!

1464
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:24,820
Fight!

1465
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:25,620
Civil War!

1466
00:52:25,900 --> 00:52:26,400
Let's go!

1467
00:52:27,180 --> 00:52:28,900
Alright, what a script!

1468
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:31,260
Too real!

1469
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:33,860
Alright, next up in this matchup.

1470
00:52:34,140 --> 00:52:34,720
Aracaluto!

1471
00:52:36,060 --> 00:52:36,600
Wait, let me...

1472
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:38,280
I can...

1473
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:40,060
Put that in.

1474
00:52:40,980 --> 00:52:42,220
Luto is here.

1475
00:52:42,740 --> 00:52:44,180
Alright, next up.

1476
00:52:44,260 --> 00:52:46,000
Who is Luto gonna fight against?

1477
00:52:48,100 --> 00:52:51,900
I like how all the Holostars guys are like dodging each other at the moment.

1478
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:53,040
Hahahaha!

1479
00:52:53,660 --> 00:52:53,800
No!

1480
00:52:55,700 --> 00:52:58,760
It will be Sayu versus Luto!

1481
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:01,840
Alright.

1482
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:05,220
Our announcer is gonna be joining the fight.

1483
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:07,260
Let me fucking...

1484
00:53:07,260 --> 00:53:08,940
Let me change this real fast.

1485
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:10,440

Alright!

1489
00:53:12,820 --> 00:53:14,240
Sayu sweep!

1490
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:17,480
I wonder who's gonna win between the...

1491
00:53:18,260 --> 00:53:20,580
Between a fucking...

1492
00:53:20,580 --> 00:53:21,240
Hahahaha!

1493
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:21,840
Shit!

1494
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:23,280
Hahahaha!

1495
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:25,960
Hahahaha!

1496
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:32,000
If anything, you guys roast better than me anyway.

1497
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:33,420
Hahahaha!

1498
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:37,060
The announcer joins the scuffle!

1499
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:39,140
Seagull versus Sayu.

1500
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:40,640
Say it, coward!

1501
00:53:40,820 --> 00:53:43,440
Whatever I say will never be as bad as what chat says.

1502
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:48,600
I swear, chat is like way more creative in coming up with like roasts than me.

1503
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:50,540
Cause you guys have like a group effort.

1504
00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:54,140
And then I'd steal your roast and then pose it off as my own roast.

1505
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:57,120
And then people would be like, Wow, Doki, you're so fucking clever.

1506
00:53:57,300 --> 00:53:58,040
And I was like, thanks.

1507
00:53:58,140 --> 00:53:59,120
I came up with it myself.

1508
00:53:59,900 --> 00:54:00,780
Juno Nagi!

1509
00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:02,560
Would be the next matchup!

1510
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:04,700
Wait, that's not Juno Nagi.

1511
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:05,300
Give me a sec.

1512
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:06,620
That is not Asteria.

1513
00:54:06,940 --> 00:54:09,080
Juno Nagi will be the next one.

1514
00:54:09,140 --> 00:54:11,040
Oh my god, it's finally getting smaller!

1515
00:54:11,420 --> 00:54:14,700
The wheel is finally getting smaller!

1516
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:16,180
We're almost there!

1517
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:17,080
Hahaha!

1518
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:19,840
Way to expose yourself, Doki.

1519
00:54:20,020 --> 00:54:21,760
I mean, it was pretty obvious.

1520
00:54:22,140 --> 00:54:22,780
Hahahaha!

1521
00:54:24,740 --> 00:54:29,400
Juno Nagi will be fighting against Benzai Haka!

1522
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:30,340
Hahaha!

1523
00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:32,540
Hahaha!

1524
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:33,720
A bird and an eel.

1525
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:35,800
I think birds eat eels, don't they?

1526
00:54:36,060 --> 00:54:41,680
I mean, I guess like if Juno is like electric, maybe like she can zap Haka.

1527
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:43,160
Because like birds are...

1528
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:47,560
What I know from Pokemon is that birds are weak against electricity.

1529
00:54:48,260 --> 00:54:53,060
To be fair, everybody's weak against electricity except for like, I guess, electric eels.

1530
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:54,020
Hahaha!

1531
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:55,760
Wait, has anyone...

1532
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:56,040
Okay.

1533
00:54:56,680 --> 00:54:59,580
Saying that is like technically like unethical.

1534
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:01,720
Like zapping an electric eel.

1535
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:04,300
But I'm just thinking like can like eels get...

1536
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:07,780
Can electric eels technically get electrocuted?

1537
00:55:07,900 --> 00:55:10,760
And by getting electrocuted, like do they just like get...

1538
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:12,700
Is it just like neutral to them?

1539
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:15,260
Or like can they die from electricity?

1540
00:55:15,980 --> 00:55:16,880
Like that's what I...

1541
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:17,220
Hahaha!

1542
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:19,960
What?

1543
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:20,800
Aren't you guys...

1544
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:21,280
Wait, they can...

1545
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:22,540
Yes as in they'll be okay?

1546
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:24,660
Or yes as in they'll die?

1547
00:55:24,940 --> 00:55:25,540
Like I don't know.

1548
00:55:25,540 --> 00:55:26,300
How would you know?

1549
00:55:26,860 --> 00:55:28,300
How do you guys know?

1550
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:29,720
Have you guys ever seen it happen?

1551
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:34,800
High enough well can kill eels?

1552
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:35,880
Yeah, but what...

1553
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:36,900
How high is high?

1554
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:37,960
Hahaha!

1555
00:55:39,660 --> 00:55:40,720
That's the thing.

1556
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:43,560
How high is like high enough?

1557
00:55:43,900 --> 00:55:45,200
I'm just curious.

1558
00:55:45,780 --> 00:55:46,920
I'm just curious, you know?

1559
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:47,880
Anyway.

1560
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:50,840
Haka will be fighting a Juna.

1561
00:55:52,220 --> 00:55:54,220
Let me put that in.

1562
00:55:54,940 --> 00:55:55,800
All right.

1563
00:55:55,880 --> 00:55:56,800
Next up.

1564
00:55:56,860 --> 00:55:58,760
Another removal of the name.

1565
00:55:59,060 --> 00:56:00,600
It's time to spin the wheel.

1566
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:02,480
Spin that wheel!

1567
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:05,520
All right.

1568
00:56:05,540 --> 00:56:09,200
Fillion will be the last matchup for bracket two.

1569
00:56:11,080 --> 00:56:11,720
Welcome.

1570
00:56:12,780 --> 00:56:14,600
Welcome to fight club Fillion.

1571
00:56:14,900 --> 00:56:16,840
For legal fight club.

1572
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:17,800
Hahaha!

1573
00:56:20,180 --> 00:56:22,800
The one you can actually talk about.

1574
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:23,580
All right.

1575
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:26,120
Fillion will be the last matchup for this...

1576
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:28,060
Will be one of the last matchup for this bracket.

1577
00:56:28,460 --> 00:56:30,400
And who would Fillion be fighting?

1578
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:31,040
Today?

1579
00:56:31,260 --> 00:56:31,820
Not today.

1580
00:56:31,980 --> 00:56:32,620
25th.

1581
00:56:37,980 --> 00:56:39,740
Sarah or Remilia?

1582
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:41,460
Oh, Remilia!

1583
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:48,020
Fillion will be fighting Remilia for the final matchup for bracket number two.

1584
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:49,420
I think we're...

1585
00:56:49,420 --> 00:56:51,320
Finally, we have one last bracket, guys.

1586
00:56:52,320 --> 00:56:54,740
One last bracket for everybody.

1587
00:56:56,120 --> 00:56:58,720
Let me just put this in here.

1588
00:56:58,720 --> 00:56:58,900
Okay.

1589
00:56:59,420 --> 00:57:00,240
All right.

1590
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:01,780
Fillion versus Remilia.

1591
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:04,040
All right, guys.

1592
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:05,580
I forgot to remove Remilia.

1593
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:07,560
Let me remove.

1594
00:57:07,820 --> 00:57:08,400
All right.

1595
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:10,720
The final seven.

1596
00:57:12,120 --> 00:57:16,500
One person will get to be lucky and like, I guess, like, move on without fighting anybody.

1597
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:17,440
So...

1598
00:57:22,460 --> 00:57:28,700
One person will be very lucky and they just move on without fighting anybody.

1599
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:32,660
So, whoever they are, congratulations.

1600
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:36,180
There's so many.

1601
00:57:36,220 --> 00:57:42,820
I feel like the Holostars members are actually, like, dodging each other for a matchup within Holostars.

1602
00:57:45,980 --> 00:57:47,200
They're so lucky.

1603
00:57:47,360 --> 00:57:49,020
They actually dodged everybody.

1604
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:50,940
Like, how the fuck did they do that?

1605
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:51,900
All right, guys.

1606
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
Take the screenshot so I can steal it later.

1607
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,720
Take the screenshot, guys.

1608
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:57,380
Nier Asamba will be in a show match.

1609
00:57:57,580 --> 00:58:01,000
They will not be in a tournament structure because we don't know when the tournament's going to end.

1610
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:02,600
So, they get to have, like...

1611
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:05,140
So, they will be showing up in the beginning of each day.

1612
00:58:05,260 --> 00:58:06,380
Well, not each day.

1613
00:58:06,460 --> 00:58:07,120
One of the days.

1614
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:09,760
They'll be showing up in one of the days for the show match.

1615
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:13,060
The match itself will be a surprise.

1616
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:19,700
Whoever their matchup will be a surprise as well until the day of the tournament where you get to see it live.

1617
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:23,980
We all was really surprised.

1618
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:24,220
We were like, what?

1619
00:58:24,220 --> 00:58:24,940
We're late from the start.

1620
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:27,620
Let's take a screenshot for bracket number two.

1621
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:29,060
All right.

1622
00:58:29,860 --> 00:58:32,700
It's time for bracket number three.

1623
00:58:32,780 --> 00:58:35,460
Let me put all of this back in here.

1624
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:36,420
All right.

1625
00:58:36,420 --> 00:58:37,040
Wheel time.

1626
00:58:37,300 --> 00:58:37,940
Wheel time.

1627
00:58:38,740 --> 00:58:42,080
It's time to spin the wheel for the last bracket.

1628
00:58:44,360 --> 00:58:46,400
We're, like, sort of speedrunning this a little.

1629
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:52,220
Sarah will be in the first matchup for bracket number three.

1630
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:56,720
Alright, let me put Sarah in right now.

1631
00:59:00,660 --> 00:59:03,340
Who will Sarah play against?

1632
00:59:06,340 --> 00:59:08,160
Doki is dodging the wheel.

1633
00:59:08,220 --> 00:59:09,100
I hope I get a free pass.

1634
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:11,160
Please.

1635
00:59:11,850 --> 00:59:12,240
Yay!

1636
00:59:12,620 --> 00:59:13,380
Not me!

1637
00:59:16,910 --> 00:59:19,520
Shinri will be fighting against Sarah!

1638
00:59:20,660 --> 00:59:23,020
Finally, another Hall of Stars member.

1639
00:59:26,580 --> 00:59:28,720
Sarah versus Shinri.

1640
00:59:28,980 --> 00:59:31,580
I'm dodging these fucking picks right now.

1641
00:59:31,860 --> 00:59:33,300
Get me that free entry.

1642
00:59:33,840 --> 00:59:36,900
Get me that free entry so I don't have to do anything.

1643
00:59:40,980 --> 00:59:42,360
The Doki skip.

1644
00:59:42,540 --> 00:59:43,440
Let it happen!

1645
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:45,040
I don't want to fight it.

1646
00:59:45,140 --> 00:59:46,160
I want to fucking...

1647
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:46,580
No!

1648
00:59:48,580 --> 00:59:49,140
No!

1649
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:50,320
It's almost there!

1650
00:59:50,700 --> 00:59:51,100
No!

1651
00:59:51,360 --> 00:59:52,920
Okay, I'm fighting somebody.

1652
00:59:53,220 --> 00:59:55,160
I'm fighting... I'm fighting somebody.

1653
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:57,160
It's not rigged if I'm fighting someone.

1654
00:59:57,780 --> 00:59:59,980
Guys, I don't even get a free pass.

1655
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:01,300
It's not rigged.

1656
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:03,000
Alright, who am I matching up against?

1657
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:04,600
Who am I...

1658
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:06,320
Doki.

1659
01:00:06,620 --> 01:00:08,260
Who am I matching up against?

1660
01:00:08,620 --> 01:00:09,820
Are you fucking serious?

1661
01:00:10,100 --> 01:00:10,400
Are you...

1662
01:00:16,100 --> 01:00:18,360
I will be fighting Axel!

1663
01:00:19,840 --> 01:00:22,680
The fucking matchup of the century!

1664
01:00:25,360 --> 01:00:29,660
I will be going up against Axel.

1665
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:32,000
What the fuck is this luck?

1666
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:32,980
We got...

1667
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:34,460
It's over.

1668
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:35,380
For who?

1669
01:00:35,780 --> 01:00:37,600
Who is it over for?

1670
01:00:37,780 --> 01:00:39,200
Who are you cheering for?

1671
01:00:41,320 --> 01:00:43,960
I'm literally the main event organizer!

1672
01:00:44,680 --> 01:00:46,860
No, finish the story.

1673
01:00:47,220 --> 01:00:49,320
The ultimate show.

1674
01:00:49,320 --> 01:00:49,780
Showdown.

1675
01:00:52,820 --> 01:00:56,040
Anyway, so I guess I will be fighting Axel.

1676
01:00:56,540 --> 01:00:57,760
Alright, give me...

1677
01:00:58,320 --> 01:00:59,300
Alright, finally.

1678
01:00:59,560 --> 01:01:02,280
It's Octavio, Zaya, and Beto.

1679
01:01:02,580 --> 01:01:04,180
I swear, Beto gets a fucking free pass.

1680
01:01:04,300 --> 01:01:04,920
I swear to God.

1681
01:01:07,020 --> 01:01:08,800
It's so over.

1682
01:01:09,320 --> 01:01:09,880
Alright.

1683
01:01:12,220 --> 01:01:16,100
Octavio will be the third matchup on that day.

1684
01:01:16,680 --> 01:01:17,240
Remove.

1685
01:01:17,460 --> 01:01:18,020
Remove.

1686
01:01:19,320 --> 01:01:22,120
Alright, who will Octavio be fighting against?

1687
01:01:23,380 --> 01:01:26,100
Octavio, either Beto or Zaya.

1688
01:01:27,700 --> 01:01:31,800
And one person will get to have a free pass.

1689
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
And that one person is Beto.

1690
01:01:38,840 --> 01:01:42,880
Finally, the last two matchups.

1691
01:01:45,060 --> 01:01:46,820
Octavio versus Zaya.

1692
01:01:46,820 --> 01:01:49,640
And Beto versus nobody.

1693
01:01:49,960 --> 01:01:51,420
Because he gets a free pass.

1694
01:01:51,780 --> 01:01:55,100
He gets the fucking lady luck blessing him today.

1695
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:57,560
Alright, boom.

1696
01:01:57,940 --> 01:01:58,220
Alright.

1697
01:01:58,540 --> 01:02:01,180
But here are your brackets, guys.

1698
01:02:02,260 --> 01:02:03,140
Bracket three.

1699
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:08,060
I don't have bracket one and two because I literally just overwrote one and two.

1700
01:02:08,280 --> 01:02:14,580
So like, if you want to know where bracket one and two is, feel free to...

1701
01:02:14,580 --> 01:02:18,080
We are eliminating a lot of Holostar members right off the bat.

1702
01:02:18,280 --> 01:02:18,840
Like, I don't...

1703
01:02:18,840 --> 01:02:21,040
How is that possible?

1704
01:02:23,180 --> 01:02:24,640
Because even they survive.

1705
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:26,500
Even they survive here.

1706
01:02:26,980 --> 01:02:29,380
Like, they have to fight against each other.

1707
01:02:29,740 --> 01:02:31,940
So, Beto versus Beto.

1708
01:02:32,020 --> 01:02:32,340
You know what?

1709
01:02:32,420 --> 01:02:32,960
That'll be fun.

1710
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:38,220
If there's more than one Beto wrestler, we'll have two Betos fighting against each other.

1711
01:02:38,380 --> 01:02:41,880
And then we'll see whichever Beto wins will be the Beto representative.

1712
01:02:42,580 --> 01:02:43,100
So...

1713
01:02:43,100 --> 01:02:47,160
If there's so many Beto fan wrestlers, we'll have them fight each other.

1714
01:02:47,500 --> 01:02:48,060
And then...

1715
01:02:48,060 --> 01:02:48,300
Yeah.

1716
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:49,520
Beto too.

1717
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:51,940
Clearly would win the tournament, maybe.

1718
01:02:56,040 --> 01:02:57,600
If he's lucky.

1719
01:02:57,840 --> 01:03:00,400
Maybe Beto too would end up sweeping everything.

1720
01:03:01,480 --> 01:03:02,080
Beto...

1721
01:03:05,360 --> 01:03:06,560
Beto too.

1722
01:03:07,140 --> 01:03:08,960
Alright, Beto versus Beto.

1723
01:03:09,460 --> 01:03:11,500
I feel like that's like the best...

1724
01:03:12,300 --> 01:03:12,900
Beto...

1725
01:03:12,900 --> 01:03:12,980
Beto...

1726
01:03:12,980 --> 01:03:14,400
The mirror match.

1727
01:03:18,420 --> 01:03:19,900
Gold Bullet is...

1728
01:03:19,900 --> 01:03:21,460
will be in a show match.

1729
01:03:21,740 --> 01:03:23,260
Gold Bullet is not in the tournament.

1730
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:25,100
But, they'll be there for casting.

1731
01:03:25,340 --> 01:03:28,020
They'll be there throughout the tournament for casting wise.

1732
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:31,180
But they said that, originally they wanted to just casting.

1733
01:03:31,300 --> 01:03:33,200
Just to be in the show match.

1734
01:03:33,420 --> 01:03:35,360
Just to even out the show matches.

1735
01:03:36,560 --> 01:03:37,000
So...

1736
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:37,380
Anyway.

1737
01:03:37,580 --> 01:03:37,920
Yes!

1738
01:03:38,200 --> 01:03:39,500
Here are all the brackets.

1739
01:03:40,040 --> 01:03:42,540
I don't have one and two because I overwrote it.

1740
01:03:42,900 --> 01:03:48,020
So if you want to know what one and two brackets were, please look at Twitter, I guess.

1741
01:03:50,920 --> 01:03:54,720
Or rewind this VOD if you are a VOD watcher.

1742
01:04:00,660 --> 01:04:02,020
Very professional, Doki.

1743
01:04:02,180 --> 01:04:07,340
You've been hosting and organizing events for so long and you're still just as incompetent.

1744
01:04:12,900 --> 01:04:14,740
I'm super hyped for this, honestly.

1745
01:04:14,820 --> 01:04:18,520
Let me go back to the chatting real quick.

1746
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:25,140
I am very hyped for for WrestleTuber.

1747
01:04:25,240 --> 01:04:42,820
Again, a huge shout out to Gamersupps for providing like full-on, probably full sponsor to this event so that I don't have to pay for anything, including like the the, you know, the belts, the graphics, everything related to to this event.

1748
01:04:42,900 --> 01:04:49,580
I can't wait for you guys to see the video when it's done because it was actually a really sick video and I was going to play that video for the announcement.

1749
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:58,200
But so many things happened last minute that we couldn't get the video done in time.

1750
01:04:58,300 --> 01:05:00,160
And I was like, I was like, I'm so sorry.

1751
01:05:00,320 --> 01:05:01,300
I'm really sorry.

1752
01:05:01,560 --> 01:05:05,820
I was like, I would be like, hey, like, I'm so sorry to my editor.

1753
01:05:05,960 --> 01:05:07,320
I'll be like, oh, my God, sorry.

1754
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:08,600
This is a last minute addition.

1755
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:09,340
Here you go.

1756
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:11,760
By the way, Octavia is going to be a caster.

1757
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:12,680
This is very last minute.

1758
01:05:12,900 --> 01:05:13,220
I'm so sorry.

1759
01:05:13,300 --> 01:05:17,960
And then literally like two or three hours later, I'll be like, I'm so sorry.

1760
01:05:18,060 --> 01:05:19,460
There's another last minute addition.

1761
01:05:23,770 --> 01:05:24,770
Here it is.

1762
01:05:24,870 --> 01:05:26,190
Here's the here's the graphic.

1763
01:05:26,450 --> 01:05:27,610
I'm so sorry.

1764
01:05:29,730 --> 01:05:33,090
Here's here's another thing I have to add.

1765
01:05:33,350 --> 01:05:39,050
And and then and then like and then I'll be like, I'm just I swear this is it.

1766
01:05:39,070 --> 01:05:40,270
This is these are everybody.

1767
01:05:40,390 --> 01:05:42,990
It's it's a hard cap for real this time.

1768
01:05:45,810 --> 01:05:48,930
So I really apologize to the editor.

1769
01:05:49,170 --> 01:05:52,170
And I'm really sorry that we couldn't get the video done.

1770
01:05:52,490 --> 01:05:55,590
But when you guys see the video, it's so cool.

1771
01:05:56,530 --> 01:05:58,550
It's so fucking cool.

1772
01:05:59,230 --> 01:06:10,350
And I'll be posting all the rules, the brackets, all the information regarding WrestleTuber on on Twitter.

1773
01:06:11,060 --> 01:06:13,030
All the information will be there.

1774
01:06:13,170 --> 01:06:14,230
And the guidelines.

1775
01:06:14,550 --> 01:06:20,710
The rules on how to make your wrestler for the people that will be using your wrestler to represent them.

1776
01:06:21,250 --> 01:06:24,790
And again, a huge thank you to all the participants.

1777
01:06:25,130 --> 01:06:28,730
They are giving their own time to participate in this event.

1778
01:06:29,810 --> 01:06:32,070
Like this was a very ambitious project for me.

1779
01:06:32,150 --> 01:06:36,510
One of the hardest things I've ever organized solely by myself, by the way.

1780
01:06:36,650 --> 01:06:38,930
There was no outside management.

1781
01:06:39,030 --> 01:06:43,810
My management team did not help me organize this because I chose to do this myself.

1782
01:06:44,130 --> 01:06:45,030
They offered.

1783
01:06:45,170 --> 01:06:50,290
But because I felt like I wanted this to be more less, I wanted to be less serious.

1784
01:06:50,290 --> 01:07:00,310
And by not having like management there, it gives off a more carefree vibe, a more carefree vibe, a less serious, like try hard thing.

1785
01:07:00,430 --> 01:07:04,090
We're all just there to make memories and enjoy an event together.

1786
01:07:05,210 --> 01:07:12,910
So like everything was done solely by me when it comes to organizing all of this.

1787
01:07:13,370 --> 01:07:17,850
And reaching out to people and and inviting them to participate.

1788
01:07:18,410 --> 01:07:31,150
Like I said, a huge shout out to everybody for saying yes to participating in this and for joining the server and for willing to give their own time because this event lasts a very long time because we all know how long it took last time.

1789
01:07:31,270 --> 01:07:31,590
So

1790
01:07:37,270 --> 01:07:47,310
so like it's understandable that like super like that, like people were like, oh, I don't know because it was a very long event.

1791
01:07:47,630 --> 01:07:52,430
And I originally had a hard cap for less participants.

1792
01:07:52,670 --> 01:07:56,170
But then that hard cap became a softer cap.

1793
01:07:56,450 --> 01:08:05,010
And then and then later on became a hard cap because I was like, oh, man, that's that was long.

1794
01:08:05,510 --> 01:08:06,950
That's a lot of people.

1795
01:08:11,150 --> 01:08:12,750
I was like, yes.

1796
01:08:13,370 --> 01:08:14,190
A lot of people.

1797
01:08:19,510 --> 01:08:31,970
So please check out all the VTubers that are participating, are giving up their time to be part of this event and to just celebrate VTubing in general.

1798
01:08:32,690 --> 01:08:42,550
I hope by doing this, there might be more incentives for more big events similar to this where it can unite various companies.

1799
01:08:43,370 --> 01:08:57,430
And various Indies together, just like how we see it in Japan with like Vault Room stuff, Shibuya Hell and CR and Crazy Raccoon.

1800
01:08:57,610 --> 01:09:03,050
And this is basically like this basically something I want to do equivalent to that.

1801
01:09:03,230 --> 01:09:13,190
And I hope that this inspires more events like this in the future, not just from me, but from other but from other people that want to organize events.

1802
01:09:13,370 --> 01:09:19,270
As well, because I feel like, like I said, this is what we heavily lacked in the English VTubing sphere.

1803
01:09:19,870 --> 01:09:28,370
We have a lot of events from companies or from Indies that are just Indies or like or like VTubers and Fleshies or like within the company.

1804
01:09:28,470 --> 01:09:29,370
But we don't have events.

1805
01:09:29,670 --> 01:09:33,470
We don't really have events that unite people from different places.

1806
01:09:33,650 --> 01:09:35,450
And this is what I wanted to do.

1807
01:09:35,530 --> 01:09:43,070
This was clearly my next roadmap, something I wanted to evolve into the future with.

1808
01:09:43,750 --> 01:09:44,490
So, yeah.

1809
01:09:44,650 --> 01:09:46,210
Yeah, I

1810
01:09:52,570 --> 01:09:54,470
really appreciate it, guys.

1811
01:09:54,690 --> 01:09:55,590
I really am.

1812
01:09:57,450 --> 01:10:12,450
I really do appreciate you guys all showing up for this very special announcement, despite the lots of scuff in the beginning, because I am, I swear, the most unlucky bird ever when it comes to like important things that I have to do.

1813
01:10:12,610 --> 01:10:14,870
I swear I'm just so unlucky.

1814
01:10:17,210 --> 01:10:18,810
I really appreciate you guys.

1815
01:10:18,810 --> 01:10:25,170
Stick around, even though we had a very rough start and being super hyped for this event.

1816
01:10:25,430 --> 01:10:26,590
I cannot wait.

1817
01:10:26,710 --> 01:10:31,250
I hope everybody will have a lot of fun, both fans and the VTubers alike.

1818
01:10:31,670 --> 01:10:36,290
And I cannot wait to see what kind of roast they're going to do to each other.

1819
01:10:36,510 --> 01:10:38,070
I wonder if Benno is going to roast himself.

1820
01:10:39,250 --> 01:10:41,650
I just see him like looking at the mirror.

1821
01:10:45,170 --> 01:10:50,070
I see him looking at the mirror and being like, I'm better than you.

1822
01:10:52,630 --> 01:10:54,770
Hey guys, that was the announcement.

1823
01:10:55,230 --> 01:10:56,330
I'm going to rest now.

1824
01:10:56,410 --> 01:10:59,450
Next week is technically my rest week, except for Tekken.

1825
01:10:59,550 --> 01:11:02,350
I guess I'll just be grinding Tekken for Seijan Slam.

1826
01:11:02,630 --> 01:11:04,610
It's going to be a very busy time.

1827
01:11:05,490 --> 01:11:13,810
But I'm going to hope that next week is semi-rest week because mostly I'll just be grinding Tekken instead of doing anything else.

1828
01:11:14,030 --> 01:11:16,590
But I might not be streaming a lot of the Tekken thing.

1829
01:11:17,550 --> 01:11:24,130
I'll definitely be streaming the fucking rounds, I guess, of all the stuff that's going on, like the tournament itself.

1830
01:11:24,510 --> 01:11:27,250
I don't know if I'll be... maybe I'll stream like one practice match.

1831
01:11:27,770 --> 01:11:28,690
But who knows?

1832
01:11:29,030 --> 01:11:34,630
Hey guys, as always, everybody stay hydrated, posture check, get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

1833
01:11:34,750 --> 01:11:39,310
And if you stay up for me, head to bed because you deserve it.

1834
01:11:39,390 --> 01:11:40,550
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

1835
01:11:41,190 --> 01:11:42,070
Bye, guys.

1836
01:11:42,770 --> 01:11:43,210
Bye.

1837
01:11:47,550 --> 01:11:47,930
Bye.
