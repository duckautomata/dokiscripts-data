00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:07,570
Hey, Dragons!

2
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:09,450
It's me, Donkeybird!

3
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:13,730
So, Respawn asked me to define my perfect Apex match.

4
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:16,370
Well, I don't think they've ever watched me play.

5
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:21,710
Because my definition of fun?

6
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:22,250
Chaos.

7
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:23,670
Lots of chaos.

8
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:27,110
Don't get me wrong, I love to get my squads back.

9
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:28,530
But accidents happen.

10
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:31,190
So, for those of you who like me, I'm gonna give you a little bit of a hint.

11
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:37,870
If you wanna drop in and fuck things up, allow me to introduce to you my main girl, Mad Maggie!

12
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:40,430
And tell you why she's the best.

13
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:43,070
I ain't gonna disappoint.

14
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:45,790
First off, I mean, look at her!

15
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:48,330
She's the most badass looking legend!

16
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:52,490
Her Wrecking Ball, it's absolutely fucking sick!

17
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:54,170
I'm just getting started.

18
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:57,330
And now her balls are even bigger!

19
00:00:57,730 --> 00:00:58,630
I mean, come on!

20
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:01,170
Who doesn't like big flaming balls?

21
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:07,430
Plus, with double riot drills, you can go max attack in the final ring.

22
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:09,610
So, now you're like, sick!

23
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:10,410
I'm sold!

24
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:12,030
Maggie for Prez 2024!

25
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:13,610
Or maybe you're not!

26
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:16,590
Either way, she doesn't give a fuck if you don't like her.

27
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:17,530
And guess what?

28
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:18,430
Neither do I.

29
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:19,570
Come on, baby!

30
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:20,650
Let's play!

31
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:24,270
And what's even better is, she's free to play.

32
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:28,650
So jump in and come for us, the Chaos Queens of Apex!

33
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:30,770
You'll probably get an easy dub.

34
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:32,210
But I'll tell you more about her in the next episode.

35
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:32,410
Thanks for watching!

36
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:32,550
And I'll see you in the next one!
