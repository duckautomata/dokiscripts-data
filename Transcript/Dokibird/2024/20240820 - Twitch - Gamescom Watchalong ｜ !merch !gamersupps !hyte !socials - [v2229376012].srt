1
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:06,980
Sorry, I didn't even have chat open.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,400
We're just straight into it.

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:09,540
I was like, oh, fuck.

4
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:14,340
I was trying to decide if I want to use YouTube or Twitch quality.

5
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:24,140
And then I found out that Twitch quality is better and it's ahead of YouTube.

6
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:25,500
So I was like, that's fucked.

7
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,560
I was like, they should be at the same speed.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,900
But the Twitch streams were ahead of the YouTube streams.

9
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:36,720
Which I was like, that's fucked.

10
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:43,320
Oh my god, I'm going to click that I'm live.

11
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:43,620
Sorry.

12
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:47,040
I don't even have chat open.

13
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,540
I'm a mess.

14
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:52,420
Oh my gosh, who cares?

15
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,260
I don't care what you're saying right now, Jeff.

16
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,940
I'm going to turn you down.

17
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:58,700
Nobody cares about where you...

18
00:00:58,700 --> 00:00:59,980
Everybody's here for the trip.

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,120
No one cares.

20
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:02,280
No one cares what you're actually saying.

21
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:05,580
All right.

22
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:07,940
Oh shit, surprises.

23
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:08,920
Oh, I caught that.

24
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:10,140
Okay, let me...

25
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:13,280
I need a quote or a tweet and be like, live now.

26
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:18,300
Okay.

27
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:22,020
Live now.

28
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:23,420
There we go.

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,560
I'm a professional streamer.

30
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:29,960
Hello.

31
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:32,880
Guys, Jeff is talking.

32
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,420
You guys don't care what he's saying?

33
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:38,720
What do you mean?

34
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:40,040
Turn up the volume.

35
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,800
What do you mean?

36
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:42,980
We don't...

37
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:45,500
I'll turn it up when he's not talking.

38
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:46,160
Chat.

39
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,440
You guys do not care about what he's saying.

40
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,260
Okay, now I'll turn it up.

41
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,880
Not actual gameplay.

42
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,260
Oh, 2K games.

43
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:59,680
I like how it says not actually gameplay.

44
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:10,160
That like makes me feel much more like, you know, it definitely reassures me a lot.

45
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:12,420
When it's...

46
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:12,620
No!

47
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:13,540
What?

48
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,180
Are you...

49
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:17,660
No way!

50
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:20,740
Are you fucking...

51
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:22,100
Okay, it's all right.

52
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:22,620
We're...

53
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:23,980
Everything is fine.

54
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:24,760
Okay.

55
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:28,580
Okay.

56
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:29,580
I'm a mess.

57
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:30,560
Everything's okay.

58
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,160
The curse of...

59
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:34,860
Let's get...

60
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:36,000
Nothing important happened.

61
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:36,700
Okay.

62
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,580
Nothing important has happened so far.

63
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:41,740
The curse of Jeff.

64
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:42,940
All right.

65
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:43,220
Okay.

66
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:43,880
We're okay now.

67
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,240
Everything's fine now.

68
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,260
All right.

69
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:50,240
Is the volume a lot better now, guys?

70
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:54,360
I'm fine.

71
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:54,840
I'm fine.

72
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:55,320
I'm fine.

73
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:56,360
Oh, Borderlands?

74
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:57,440
Wait.

75
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:57,780
What?

76
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,440
Oh, right after the shitty movie?

77
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:01,520
That's awkward.

78
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:02,260
No!

79
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:03,560
Borderlands 4?

80
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:05,840
I mean, like...

81
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,560
Okay.

82
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,300
Not gonna lie.

83
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,060
This is so...

84
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:08,240
Yeah.

85
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:08,800
I was like...

86
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,660
This is so fucked.

87
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,640
Right after the very shitty movie that came out.

88
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:16,860
It's definitely a lot less hype now for me.

89
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,520
Borderlands 4 is coming in 2025.

90
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,560
Next up, October 25th.

91
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:21,940
Marks the release of...

92
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:22,620
Oh, my God.

93
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:23,340
Black Ops 6.

94
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:24,620
I feel like, you know...

95
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:24,840
Black Ops 6.

96
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:27,540
It's a little awkward with the timing and everything.

97
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:28,480
Yeah.

98
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:33,700
Oh, this is so awkward.

99
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,380
I'm not as hyped because of the very bad movie.

100
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,420
They made a movie?

101
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:47,840
People have already, like, already, like, blocked it out of their mind.

102
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,780
Not a single cheer.

103
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:54,840
It features an all-new campaign with 16 new characters.

104
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:55,440
That's the new one.

105
00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:02,660
Also, they've got new multiplayer maps with the return of classic prestige in theatre mode and two brand new zombies experiences on day one.

106
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:03,060
Oh.

107
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,720
Did they fix the problems with Call of Duty?

108
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:06,040
Oh.

109
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:10,700
And War Zone gameplay at the Call of Duty Next event on August 28th.

110
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:11,700
But did you fix the issue?

111
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:15,700
Did you fix the issue...

112
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:16,400
No, day one.

113
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:19,780
Did they fix the security issue?

114
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:21,600
That's the thing.

115
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,180
Yeah.

116
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:29,480
Today, we're here representing the Raven team, who's leading the campaign in partnership with Treyarch.

117
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:34,480
The Black Ops 6 campaign is set in the early 90s...

118
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,240
Security issue?

119
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:39,460
Oh, like if you play Call of Duty, apparently it's very easy for hackers to get in.

120
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:46,300
You're joined by legendary characters Frank Woods, the Grizzled Vet, and Russell Adler, the Ultimate Wild Card.

121
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:56,180
Together with new allies Troy Marshall and Jane Harrow, and unbound by normal rules of engagement, you'll unravel a mind-bending conspiracy.

122
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,540
In the mission we're about to show you...

123
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:02,980
Wait, do people actually play Call of Duty for the lore?

124
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,480
I thought it was just war.

125
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:12,120
They're like, this mission's gonna be super interesting.

126
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:16,280
And I'm like, wait, people pay attention to the lore?

127
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:22,900
So we're gonna show up to this fundraiser, get what we need from the senator, then grab Adler...

128
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:25,520
Why do I sound so bored talking about- it's fucking Call of Duty!

129
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,300
Like, how- It's literally the same game rehashed six different times.

130
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:36,940
Not even six, it's been rehashed like, so many times.

131
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:41,320
They've like, literally ran out of war to make games about.

132
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:45,880
The senator isn't giving interviews tonight, and he doesn't go anywhere without his security detail.

133
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:50,520
I've marked a few leads that could help get you close enough to do the retinal scan.

134
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:51,700
Take your pick.

135
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:56,420
I got it on good authority that the senator's- Are we like, Indiana Jones-ing it now?

136
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,320
What the fuck?

137
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:02,400
What the fuck is this spy shit?

138
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:03,880
What?

139
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:08,360
Wait, are we hitmanning?

140
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,920
I've cleaned up another of your messes.

141
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,200
That was Bill Clinton?!

142
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,540
I couldn't even recognize him!

143
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:22,100
Oh shit, we ran out of war so we're going straight to CIA.

144
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:32,230
Snap!

145
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:33,810
That's going in my cringe compilation.

146
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:40,070
I modified the infrared image to highlight the capillaries in the senator's retina.

147
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:42,230
It should have just enough resolution.

148
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:44,930
What?

149
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:46,990
Oh!

150
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:48,550
It's like the scan-in.

151
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:50,570
What is this?

152
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:54,570
This is Call of Duty now?

153
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:59,590
Are we gonna kill the- Wait, I don't know if I can say that as a joke.

154
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:01,370
Like, even if we're a game.

155
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:04,910
I stopped myself.

156
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:07,570
I was like, I don't want to get bad.

157
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:13,230
Like, what- Are you serious?!

158
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:15,850
What?!

159
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:16,610
Are you- Okay!

160
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:24,860
Like, why are we at the- I'm so confused.

161
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:25,940
What is the plot?

162
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:29,340
This is so poorly timed.

163
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:35,120
This is- This is so poorly timed!

164
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:37,620
This game is- Oh my god!

165
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,060
The old man says you're worth it.

166
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,280
You better be right.

167
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,020
Sev, we got the prize.

168
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:45,760
Good.

169
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:46,720
Now get out.

170
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:47,420
Fine.

171
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:49,360
We've got party crushers up here.

172
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,080
Great.

173
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:51,960
You good to go?

174
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,160
I am now.

175
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,800
What the fuck?!

176
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:05,060
Is this where- That's where all the taxpayer's money went to.

177
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,120
Take cover!

178
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,720
For that one guy.

179
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:12,720
Yeah, I was like, what is this Fallout shit?

180
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:14,300
For that one guy.

181
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:17,060
I don't think Pulitzer can hit him.

182
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:23,460
500 million- No, what- 500 billion dollars went into that one guy.

183
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:27,980
Each bullet cost $50,000.

184
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:31,740
And-

185
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:43,750
I actually sort of want to play the game just for the little baby cart.

186
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:46,010
The RC cart!

187
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:46,770
Yeah!

188
00:08:47,270 --> 00:09:00,220
I- I sort of- I sort of want- I just like hit- I was like, what the f- Where did he pull that from?

189
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,000
Where did he-

190
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:09,780
The toy car destroys $5 billion guy.

191
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:18,800
This is a se- If it was a serious trailer, it would not show the fucking RC car.

192
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:19,720
I am- Wow!

193
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:19,820
I'm such a good person!

194
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:28,180
He's literally coughing baby, Bruce is hiding in the bomb.

195
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:33,600
Oh...

196
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:38,990
Let go.

197
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:41,010
Let him go would be so funny.

198
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:54,030
I know this is Call of Duty!

199
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:56,790
They're like inside a building!

200
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:59,990
It's like Call of Duty is supposed to be outside.

201
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:01,430
Oh there it is.

202
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:02,790
No this is still inside.

203
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:06,030
Oh my god that was Bill Clinton!

204
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:11,790
Wait what year is this?

205
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:22,020
This is legitimately a very poorly timed game.

206
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:24,660
Like...

207
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:28,840
If my like assumption on the plot is like...

208
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,580
Like...

209
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,100
That's boring Call of Duty.

210
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:55,150
America!

211
00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:56,930
Fuck yeah!

212
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:11,660
Wait how's the sound so far?

213
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:27,560
Oh shit!

214
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,180
Wait that looks sick!

215
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,000
I fucking hate...

216
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,140
That looks sick and I don't have to drive the motorcycle while shooting.

217
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:36,420
That's my favorite part.

218
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:42,160
Yo this is America!

219
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,300
This is what people think...

220
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:48,220
Like outside of America think what America is like everyday.

221
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,680
The Illuminati!

222
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:56,740
They showed the fucking Illuminati!

223
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:01,440
Confirmed!

224
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:02,900
Illuminati confirmed!

225
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,280
August 30th!

226
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:06,380
Wait that's so close!

227
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:08,880
There you go Black Ops 6.

228
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,520
More coming at Call of Duty next.

229
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:11,640
That's actually so close.

230
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,760
My co-host for opening night live.

231
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:17,680
You know her from her years of hosting League of Legends eSports around the world.

232
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:21,660
Did you know that she got her start as a competitive Unreal Tournament player?

233
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:22,280
What?

234
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,260
Please join me in welcoming to ONL Shox!

235
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:25,960
Who?

236
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:34,790
Gamescom thank you for the warm welcome.

237
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:37,630
Unreal Tournament that is quite the throwback.

238
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:42,190
But I am so excited to be here tonight revealing many of the games on opening night live.

239
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:44,830
Wait if she's from Unreal Tournament then she's a hag.

240
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:46,310
Gamescom week in Cologne.

241
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:50,870
Gamescom really is the best week for games worldwide every year.

242
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:55,430
And I am so stoked to be back here with you all celebrating it.

243
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:59,610
Now it is my pleasure to share a message from Gamescom to you.

244
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:00,330
You can't see.

245
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:01,690
Why can't I see?

246
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:06,510
It's not negative.

247
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:10,850
I hope you visit wonderful places.

248
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:12,450
Oh that's a cute cosplay.

249
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:14,550
I bought the real blocks.

250
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:17,930
And that you always have the best adventures.

251
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:21,590
That you fight for the things you love.

252
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:24,010
And that you love the things you do.

253
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:26,250
Dear future me.

254
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:28,730
My favorite thing in the world is to play.

255
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:30,830
Do you like to play too?

256
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:34,950
Welcome to Gamescom.

257
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:36,070
We're there.

258
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:37,170
That's us.

259
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:40,970
Yes the future is here and we are ready to play.

260
00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:43,010
Let's take a look at this fun trailer.

261
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:44,550
Wait I can't say that about Fleshtubers.

262
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:48,170
I thought hag was like a universal term.

263
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:52,810
I meant that like positively.

264
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:53,410
Positively.

265
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:59,230
Oh no I'm chronically online.

266
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:02,170
Oh no.

267
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,870
I'm chronically online.

268
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:14,480
What the fuck is this game?

269
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:18,080
What?

270
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:25,230
What?

271
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:26,290
What is this game?

272
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:29,870
Yeah was he...

273
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,370
Wait what?

274
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:34,290
That's...

275
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:36,590
And then there's GTA.

276
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:55,010
Is that...

277
00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:55,570
What?

278
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:04,820
What's that?

279
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:13,200
Love.

280
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:15,100
Hate.

281
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:27,690
Oh it's Goat Simulator.

282
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,210
It's Goat Simulator 3.

283
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:31,270
Isn't it?

284
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:32,330
It's Goat...

285
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:32,470
Yeah.

286
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:35,350
I fucking knew it.

287
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:37,370
Wait Goat...

288
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:38,770
Sorry Goat Simulator 4.

289
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:39,890
Or DLC.

290
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:42,370
Oh my god.

291
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:45,710
It's Goat Simulator 4.

292
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:48,670
The moment I saw...

293
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:52,170
Goat Simulator Remastered.

294
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:58,370
The moment I saw the goat I was like...

295
00:15:58,370 --> 00:16:02,710
In my opinion that looked like the goat of all remasters.

296
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:03,790
Wait does she...

297
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:04,930
Is she one of the creators?

298
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:05,710
Okay.

299
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:06,090
Okay.

300
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:06,710
Well...

301
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:12,930
We are expecting hundreds of thousands of fans at Gamescom this year in person.

302
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:15,690
But if you cannot be here with us, don't worry.

303
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:24,710
You can join us virtually by going to Gamescom Global where you can explore and discover what the world's gaming industry has in store for you.

304
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:29,190
And our very own Gamescom Studio is here with all day coverage of the event.

305
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:32,690
So tune in to Gamescom Studios broadcast by IGN on Tuesday.

306
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:34,250
On Twitch or on YouTube.

307
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:43,830
Now we have some news on Persona 3 Reload and its next DLC episode, The Answer.

308
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:46,150
Coming on September 10th.

309
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:49,970
It's time to reveal a surprising boss fight coming to the game.

310
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:50,690
Oh.

311
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:52,210
I mean...

312
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:54,410
Yay for the people who are into Persona.

313
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:56,110
...will be March 31st.

314
00:16:56,610 --> 00:16:58,730
It's like Tartarus all over again.

315
00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:02,170
There is a strong connection between all of you...

316
00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:03,230
...and what's happening.

317
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:03,850
Let's do this.

318
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:04,790
Jokey processing.

319
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:07,270
Something's wrong.

320
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:09,910
I mean, it's Persona.

321
00:17:24,330 --> 00:17:25,850
Oh, okay.

322
00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:27,590
I guess no more dancing.

323
00:17:28,330 --> 00:17:28,390
Alright.

324
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:29,910
Boo.

325
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:31,250
Boo.

326
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:32,430
Boo.

327
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:32,770
Boo.

328
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:36,390
I wanted more Persona song.

329
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:38,270
Why did you cut it short?

330
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:38,990
Boo.

331
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:43,150
I was fucking jiving.

332
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,700
They stopped the banger.

333
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:51,620
What's this?

334
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:58,380
God, I wanna play Call of Duty 6 now because of the RC cart.

335
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:00,100
That shit was so funny.

336
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,820
Very poorly tied, but so funny.

337
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:04,920
With the RC cart.

338
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:18,900
The boy?

339
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:19,420
Oh, wait.

340
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:20,300
He sounds like...

341
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:23,200
He sounds like the Australian from The Boys.

342
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:26,400
What's this?

343
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,760
It can't be dying.

344
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,020
Like, there's not enough parkour.

345
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:31,760
Is it Predator?

346
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:44,020
The graphics look like shit, but like, it could be fun.

347
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:46,560
Is this a streamer game?

348
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:50,080
Oi, huiui.

349
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:50,660
Hahaha.

350
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:51,800
Oh, it's a game.

351
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:57,840
Oh.

352
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,320
Are you playing Power Rangers?

353
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:00,160
Pfft.

354
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:03,250
Oh, my gosh.

355
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:06,510
Are you playing Power Rangers?

356
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:06,650
Oh, my gosh.

357
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:06,670
Oh, shit.

358
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:08,270
Wait, it is dying light.

359
00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:12,890
Oh, it is.

360
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:17,250
Oh, my gosh.

361
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:24,500
I was like, there's...

362
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,600
That can't be dying light.

363
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,960
There's no fucking parkour.

364
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:28,360
There's too many guns.

365
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:29,540
Dude, I don't see them.

366
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:32,040
The Beast.

367
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:37,640
Why the fuck did the opening look so, like... low quality?

368
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,420
The intro for that, I couldn't tell it was Dying Light.

369
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,680
The intro for that looked so, like, off.

370
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:51,200
That's why I was like, oh, it can't be Dying Light.

371
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,340
Black Mid?

372
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:01,640
Oh!

373
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:02,360
Wukong!

374
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:03,640
Yeah!

375
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:08,280
What?

376
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:12,240
The game's out?

377
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,520
Everybody's already playing it.

378
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:22,280
Like, by the way, I know, like, a lot of people are playing it right now.

379
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,200
Anyway, here's the launch trailer.

380
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:24,660
Noooo!

381
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:25,940
Spoilers!

382
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:29,520
I didn't watch... I only watched, like, one trailer.

383
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:29,800
Really?

384
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:37,650
Okay, apparently I, like, looked up the lore.

385
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:42,790
Apparently this game is a... I thought it was a Journey to the West.

386
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:52,150
I thought it was, like, a Journey to the West adaptation, but I was, like, really confused because I was like, Wait, this is, like... we're starting at the end of the Journey to the West, but we're going west again.

387
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:57,410
Anyway, so I was, like, reading the... it's basically... it's not really spoiler territory.

388
00:20:57,950 --> 00:21:01,630
But, oh my god, I have to fight a guy with, like, eight arms?

389
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:05,070
Oh my god, that's a giant ass baby.

390
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:06,610
There's a baby.

391
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:08,530
I can be a fucking dog

392
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:25,930
That baby grew up that baby you beat up this is him in high school now this is him now oh

393
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:36,710
Oh my god, these characters look so sick anyway for those who were very confused being like oh my god.

394
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:37,570
What the fuck?

395
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:51,990
Oh Shit, that's way too many gods to beat up But like the wu-con game is actually a sequel to the journey to the West and we're trying to like free We're trying to free wu-con

396
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:04,980
Is that the sparkling Sparkling game

397
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:17,200
Like how Dragon Ball Z trailer right after wu-con Some wu-con and then some Goku yeah

398
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:43,950
This is a game with like a million characters right with like 30 plus Goku's There should be like a game mode in sparkling zero Where you can?

399
00:22:43,950 --> 00:23:00,870
Fight with as men like we fight with as many Characters as possible like wrestling Like wrestling and then like you just put all the Goku's in one match and like a free-for-all You should be able to do a free-for-all with all Goku's

400
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:16,190
The Goku Royal Rumble The Goku Royal Rumble The Goku Royal Rumble The Goku Royal Rumble The Goku Royal Rumble What the fuck is this?

401
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,380
What the...

402
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:28,640
What the...

403
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,940
King of Meat?

404
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:42,320
Yeah, that's supposed to be Jeff.

405
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:44,620
What?

406
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:48,980
This looks like a mobile game.

407
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:56,400
It looks like the mobile game from those people with the icons where man is shouting.

408
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:03,900
That's what the graphics remind me of.

409
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:09,160
Yeah, it looks like from the creators of Clash of Clans.

410
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:24,800
God, they want to be Fall Guys so bad.

411
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:39,310
King of Meat!

412
00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:40,510
King of Meat!

413
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:42,170
Guys, it's on Amazon Games!

414
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:46,170
Wait, it's on fucking Amazon Games?

415
00:24:46,810 --> 00:24:50,190
Holy shit, there's so many, like, versions of this.

416
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:05,310
Amazon Games, what the heck is Amazon Games?

417
00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:07,350
That's a real thing?

418
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:11,470
What kind of games does Amazon Games have?

419
00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:20,030
Oh!

420
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:22,010
Is he the son of Spielberg?

421
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:28,110
Alright, linked.

422
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:28,970
Banner.

423
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:30,190
Guys, welcome to ONL.

424
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:32,390
I'm very excited to share this game with the world.

425
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:34,730
Can you tell us a little bit about your studio, first of all?

426
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:37,750
Yeah, well, first off, it's totally surreal to be here right now.

427
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:52,090
We started the studio back in 2020, and the majority of us had come from the AAA side of the industry, and at the time, we were just thrilled to have our own game, our own IP, and we could never expect being on the stage tonight at the end of that run.

428
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:57,430
The vision for our studio started with the idea of dreaming big and building smart.

429
00:25:58,270 --> 00:26:07,250
The concept for our first game, even early on, felt very unique and full of heart, and this helped us bring together a very passionate team of talented developers.

430
00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:15,590
It's through their skill, dedication, and true love for the game that we're able to be here tonight, going way beyond where we saw before.

431
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:18,510
It does look very Hi-Fi Rush-esque.

432
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:23,030
By the way, Hi-Fi Rush got bought by PUBG, so they're back now.

433
00:26:23,230 --> 00:26:24,450
The studio's back.

434
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:29,310
I thought it was funny that PUBG Studios bought Hi-Fi Rush.

435
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:44,790
I don't know if you've heard of it, but it's a game where you play with your friends, and you're going to take on the role as one of the last remaining humans on planet Earth.

436
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:50,850
Allying with a friendly bot faction, you're going to aim to take down the combat army, hellbent on organic destruction.

437
00:26:51,490 --> 00:26:55,210
Players can play alone or with friends in this vibrant world of robots.

438
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:56,870
Or...

439
00:26:58,170 --> 00:27:04,890
Sorry, I was looking at Twitch chat for, like, the stream itself, and someone was like, stare.

440
00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:12,130
The guy was just looking straight ahead.

441
00:27:28,790 --> 00:27:34,040
Guys, I'm still thinking about the RC cart.

442
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:38,540
That trailer really, like, implemented into my mind.

443
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:43,560
I'm still thinking about it.

444
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,220
I just really want to play Call of Duty.

445
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:51,940
Of course I'll fucking use that shit.

446
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:00,120
Guys, you know what would be really cool?

447
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:04,240
I bet you the RC cart is just going to be, like, one portion of the game.

448
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:07,540
Like, it's just going to be that one moment, and that's it.

449
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,020
I feel like... I feel like I'm getting fucking baited, too.

450
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,460
Like, just a five second thing.

451
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:31,080
Buying a $73 game for one RC cart.

452
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:50,660
Oh, it has fishing.

453
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:54,800
Fucking robot f- What do I do with robot fishes?

454
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:55,840
You can't eat that.

455
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,480
Do we just starve on this island?

456
00:28:57,860 --> 00:28:59,480
What is the food here?

457
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:02,840
I was like, are they all just robots?

458
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,140
How do they survive?

459
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:11,120
Now, one of the things that I love about Gamescom is that it is a safe place for our diverse game fans.

460
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:20,320
And there is an amazing platform called Gamescom Cares that shares social and environmental responsibility projects that we care deeply about.

461
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:23,540
Thanks to all of our partners who help to make this happen.

462
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:26,380
You can learn more by scanning the QR code below.

463
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:33,340
And now, the first look at the gameplay of Lost Records, Bloom, and Rage.

464
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:37,180
A narrative adventure from the creative minds behind Life is Strange.

465
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:41,600
Oh, Life is Strange.

466
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,460
I've never played this game before.

467
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:51,540
But I remember, like, when it first came out, um, everyone was, like, screaming about it.

468
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:55,980
Honestly, Swan, I'm glad, but slightly surprised that you showed up tonight.

469
00:29:57,040 --> 00:30:01,040
When I saw your text, all these memories came flooding back.

470
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:01,860
Yeah.

471
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:03,680
It was, like, a huge YouTuber meta.

472
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:05,220
I never even watched playthroughs.

473
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:24,180
Is she also gonna die, too?

474
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:25,440
Oh, shit.

475
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:25,740
Sorry.

476
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:26,540
Spoilers.

477
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:28,680
That's, like, literally the...

478
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:30,280
Sorry.

479
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:33,420
That's literally, like, the twist of...

480
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,540
Oh, yeah.

481
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:36,580
This is serious.

482
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:39,340
We're gonna need a real band name.

483
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:44,500
Bloom and Rage.

484
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,420
How could I forget?

485
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,040
Oh, guys.

486
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,160
What?

487
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:56,780
And they were roommates, by the way, guys.

488
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:59,360
My mom found a package on her doorstep.

489
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:01,040
Wait.

490
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:03,560
Are Bloom and Rage...

491
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:06,640
What?

492
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:08,520
Are we... in trouble?

493
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:11,100
Oh, this is not even Life is Strange.

494
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,680
It's just a spin-off.

495
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:14,780
Or not a spin-off.

496
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:15,780
It's just a whole new game.

497
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:18,460
Excuse me if today's sermon is a little...

498
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:19,120
Oh, yeah.

499
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:20,440
Definitely going to die.

500
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:22,920
What the fuck?

501
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:24,440
Today is not a normal Sunday.

502
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:28,380
Are we bringing back zombies again?

503
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:30,060
I wanted to...

504
00:31:31,530 --> 00:31:32,330
Oh!

505
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:34,650
In our duty to God!

506
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:39,550
I can't wait for this game to be played for you.

507
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:43,210
For like one week by all streamers and then never again.

508
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:49,780
Oh, it's...

509
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:50,380
You're right!

510
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:51,540
It's almost Halloween!

511
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:54,840
It's zombie season again!

512
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,680
It's always either...

513
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,120
It's zombies or space.

514
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:03,100
Those are like...

515
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:08,160
Oh, no more room in Hell 2.

516
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:09,420
Alright.

517
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:13,520
That game looks great.

518
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:22,100
It's a new look at the eight-player co-op of No More Room in Hell 2 from Torn Banner up in Canada where there are deadly consequences of not...

519
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:23,640
There's still no more...

520
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:27,160
So, No More Room in Hell 1 was a lie.

521
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:29,140
It's been a long time coming for this next one.

522
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:34,120
At the Game Awards in 2021, Embark Studios revealed Ark Raiders, a game that immediately...

523
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:36,760
Not gonna lie, I'm also sort of low-key bored of zombies, too.

524
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:41,400
... future Earth where menacing Ark machines threaten humanity's attempts to rebuild.

525
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:50,760
Well, Ark Raiders has evolved a lot since then, and now it's finally time for some news on what's next for this exciting action survival shooter.

526
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:52,700
Survival...

527
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:54,140
Survival...

528
00:33:00,990 --> 00:33:02,670
I hear survival.

529
00:33:07,850 --> 00:33:08,490
Look

530
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,500
at us now.

531
00:33:21,890 --> 00:33:22,530
Raiders.

532
00:33:24,610 --> 00:33:29,090
Oh, that's a gun I'd love to craft in my survival shooter.

533
00:33:39,570 --> 00:33:41,010
Ark Raiders.

534
00:33:42,710 --> 00:33:43,590
That's it.

535
00:33:43,670 --> 00:33:44,170
Wait, what?

536
00:33:44,370 --> 00:33:45,270
What's the gameplay?

537
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:46,830
What's the...

538
00:33:48,810 --> 00:33:49,570
Okay.

539
00:34:02,470 --> 00:34:03,770
Ba-dum, ba-dum.

540
00:34:04,050 --> 00:34:06,130
Ba-ba-da-dum.

541
00:34:06,270 --> 00:34:06,890
Oh

542
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:13,850
my god!

543
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:15,910
They're so cute!

544
00:34:16,570 --> 00:34:17,610
Ba-da-dum.

545
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:19,570
Ba-dum, ba-dum.

546
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:27,160
Oh my god, it's so cute!

547
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,880
Is this like a Korean...

548
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:34,380
Korean game company?

549
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:37,500
Yuki.

550
00:34:41,650 --> 00:34:42,430
Papa.

551
00:34:46,810 --> 00:34:47,590
Yuki.

552
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:00,560
Love.

553
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:01,220
Peace.

554
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:05,060
Oh my god.

555
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:08,860
This looks all pre-rendered.

556
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:17,760
Infinity.

557
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:20,800
The coziest open world game.

558
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:36,280
Space Mary Warhammer!

559
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,000
It's coming out like next week, right?

560
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,180
Or the week after?

561
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,040
In two weeks.

562
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,520
What game company made Miki?

563
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,180
Ba-ba-ba.

564
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:58,280
Ba-ba.

565
00:35:58,880 --> 00:35:59,980
Space Marine.

566
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:04,220
Play four days early?

567
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:08,600
Oh my god, there's so many good long playthrough series coming out.

568
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,960
I don't know if I should pre-order it though.

569
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,360
I don't know.

570
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:16,120
I'll go pre-order it early so I can stream it early.

571
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:19,000
But then I have like so many playthroughs.

572
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:21,440
It's made by Inful Games?

573
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:23,600
Ba-dum.

574
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:24,960
Wait, is this a...

575
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:29,000
Is this a hero shooter that people were saying looks bad?

576
00:36:37,930 --> 00:36:39,030
Oh hey, Hanzo.

577
00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:43,590
Oh no, this is not a hero shooter.

578
00:36:43,830 --> 00:36:44,490
Is it?

579
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:47,910
It looks like PvPvE.

580
00:36:50,130 --> 00:36:52,810
Drawing over 2 million players on beta?

581
00:36:54,010 --> 00:36:55,410
Oh, it's Paragon?

582
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:57,130
It's MOBA?

583
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:10,110
It looks like now that you say it's MOBA, it looks like...

584
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:10,650
Sorry.

585
00:37:20,930 --> 00:37:24,130
I guess the 2 million players was just a little too...

586
00:37:24,130 --> 00:37:26,250
UI, like, trigger-coding it.

587
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:31,700
Predecessor.

588
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:33,300
Wait, is that...

589
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:34,780
Wait, that guy looks like...

590
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:36,240
Looks like Mortal Kombat, bro.

591
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:41,920
What you saw right there was Predecessor, a MOBA shooter built by an indie team from the ashes of Epic Games' Paranoia.

592
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:42,780
MOBA shooter.

593
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:46,080
From that way, it enters 1.0 free-to-play release tonight.

594
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:48,760
Next up, Path of Exile 2.

595
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:52,620
I don't want to get in trouble, but so many game companies are making MOBA shooters now.

596
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:56,180
And tonight, yes, we do have news on the early access date.

597
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:57,100
Check this out.

598
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:59,420
They're just trying to...

599
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:01,080
They're like, everybody likes MOBA.

600
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,840
People like shooters, too.

601
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:03,980
Let's combine both.

602
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:09,480
But what they don't know is that a lot of people who play shooters don't really like MOBAs.

603
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:11,660
And people who play MOBAs don't really like shooters.

604
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:17,840
It's like a very... I feel like it's like...

605
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,900
A very niche...

606
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:20,880
Like...

607
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:24,940
A very, very niche category.

608
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:27,860
Do you have the strength?

609
00:38:31,390 --> 00:38:32,550
Build it anew.

610
00:38:35,090 --> 00:38:36,130
I must.

611
00:39:03,070 --> 00:39:04,610
Is this Path of Exile?

612
00:39:04,890 --> 00:39:05,690
It should be, right?

613
00:39:05,930 --> 00:39:07,070
It looks like it.

614
00:39:09,250 --> 00:39:11,490
It can't be a new Diablo game.

615
00:39:11,570 --> 00:39:12,590
They haven't milked it enough.

616
00:39:14,410 --> 00:39:17,230
They have to milk it at a certain point until they...

617
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:19,690
And then they'll be like, alright, I will make a new game.

618
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:27,840
True.

619
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:38,120
Well, that looks absolutely great.

620
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,380
Can't wait for that one.

621
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:42,440
And now, Gamescom is known for the cosplay.

622
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:43,700
The vision and dedication...

623
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:44,520
Wait, really?

624
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:48,660
I thought Gamescom was known for the fucking game trailers.

625
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:59,720
Do you guys know Gamescom has like several other days where they stream other stuff, but no one really talks about it because people are just here for the game trip opening night?

626
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:06,620
I was like, wait, Gamescom has like more than... is more than just one stream?

627
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:11,280
I thought it was opening night and that's it.

628
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:18,640
Plus, the Gamescom event arena, that is where I am standing right now and all of you are.

629
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:26,540
It is the biggest and most elaborate stage at Gamescom, featuring not only opening night live, but additional live shows.

630
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:29,300
I find that out because I was looking up like, what time is Gamescom?

631
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:32,260
And then they're like, well, there's this and then there's that.

632
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:34,120
But the opening night is at this time.

633
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:36,380
And I was like, there's more than one stream?

634
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:38,560
There's multiple days?

635
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,240
The open world survival MMO.

636
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:44,580
And news on when it's going to be released.

637
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:47,340
Oh, Dune Awakening.

638
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:50,960
Yeah, it's an actual convention.

639
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:53,980
I didn't realize it was an actual convention.

640
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:55,640
The thing is, I watched Gamescoms.

641
00:40:56,340 --> 00:40:58,600
Like, I did Gamescom WatchOn last year.

642
00:40:58,820 --> 00:41:03,740
And it never registered to me that it was like an actual convention in Germany.

643
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:05,740
I was just like, oh, it's...

644
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:08,800
I was just like, game trailers.

645
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:18,280
As a nameless prisoner, sculpt your appearance, choose your background, and then crash into the planet.

646
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:19,880
It's Gamescom.

647
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:22,120
I don't know.

648
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:24,180
I thought the com sounded for communication.

649
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:31,940
I thought it was spelled with an M instead of an N.

650
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:35,100
I thought it was like, games communication.

651
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,040
Welcome to Arrakis.

652
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:43,280
The most dangerous planet in the universe.

653
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:50,060
Meet hundreds of other players in the vast online world.

654
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:51,920
What do you mean?

655
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:52,720
I can't read!

656
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:54,360
It literally ends with an M!

657
00:41:55,680 --> 00:42:02,800
In this case, a spit dart rifle and a stillsuit for your help taking down territorial deserters.

658
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:05,140
Working with others will always increase your chance of staying alive.

659
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:06,460
Oh, this does look like an MMO.

660
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:10,540
The deserter base.

661
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:13,960
Climb to a vantage point.

662
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:16,900
And prepare for violence.

663
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:22,240
Your choice of weapons and abilities determines your strategy.

664
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:25,880
Swordmasters lead the charge into battle.

665
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:26,860
Literally.

666
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,040
Yeah, I know.

667
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:31,380
I was like, oh, it does look like it.

668
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:34,640
I like how he's not dodging.

669
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:35,260
He's just...

670
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:38,040
I just can't play!

671
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:39,720
He's just standing!

672
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:41,600
And he said W.

673
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:44,620
W, shit.

674
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:51,360
It's not selling me on the gameplay if he's just walk, forward, shoot.

675
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:53,680
He doesn't even move!

676
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:56,660
He hasn't even left S or D.

677
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:58,020
He literally just W.

678
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:05,760
Using a gun in Dune is crazy.

679
00:43:06,580 --> 00:43:08,320
And it's apparently a shooter.

680
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:14,920
And then sell blueprints of your architectural wonders to other players.

681
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,600
Lead your group to become a guild.

682
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:19,800
On Arrakis...

683
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:22,500
I'm surprised they don't show a gameplay trailer for PC.

684
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:25,040
Because usually if it's an MMO, you know?

685
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:28,920
You want to advertise the PC portion, not the console.

686
00:43:38,110 --> 00:43:41,170
God, this looks fucking hard to drive.

687
00:43:41,270 --> 00:43:43,970
Game radio provides insight into key events happening across Arrakis.

688
00:43:45,550 --> 00:43:47,850
People are like, that's not Dune!

689
00:43:48,170 --> 00:43:51,870
Discover landmarks, wrecked ships, and desert testing stations.

690
00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:54,810
Filled with forgotten technology.

691
00:43:58,310 --> 00:44:00,130
Arrakis is a vast planet.

692
00:44:00,590 --> 00:44:02,710
You can explore unique locations.

693
00:44:04,150 --> 00:44:05,750
Uncover valuable resources.

694
00:44:07,290 --> 00:44:10,530
And search for secrets amongst the shifting dunes.

695
00:44:11,110 --> 00:44:11,770
Wouldn't it all just be sand?

696
00:44:11,770 --> 00:44:13,670
I think my biggest issue is this is an MMO.

697
00:44:13,670 --> 00:44:16,290
But exploring the planet is just mostly sand.

698
00:44:19,430 --> 00:44:23,190
There's no diversity on biomes and stuff.

699
00:44:23,790 --> 00:44:25,150
I guess there's that.

700
00:44:39,250 --> 00:44:41,370
But there's also rocks!

701
00:44:43,670 --> 00:44:46,530
To play politics, you need power.

702
00:44:46,790 --> 00:44:50,490
And on Arrakis, spice is power.

703
00:44:51,350 --> 00:44:57,110
In the deep desert, beyond the shield wall, hundreds of players scour the landscape.

704
00:44:57,450 --> 00:44:58,850
Hunting for spice.

705
00:44:59,050 --> 00:45:02,970
Every spice blow has the potential to become a heated battle.

706
00:45:03,930 --> 00:45:07,510
With multiple guilds vying for the precious melange.

707
00:45:08,370 --> 00:45:11,490
Even when it looks like defeat is inevitable.

708
00:45:12,670 --> 00:45:14,230
Where's the sand worm?

709
00:45:18,670 --> 00:45:20,590
Is that the sand worm?

710
00:45:25,770 --> 00:45:26,710
Oh, is that it?

711
00:45:36,340 --> 00:45:38,520
That seems overpowered as hell.

712
00:45:40,060 --> 00:45:42,660
Time PC early 2025.

713
00:45:44,740 --> 00:45:47,660
Wait, so the people on console can't even play this until much later?

714
00:45:47,660 --> 00:45:50,140
Like, what's the point of showing- That's fucked.

715
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:52,700
You can't have a new game without the sand worm.

716
00:45:52,820 --> 00:45:58,820
And the sand worm summoning begins- They're like- They're like, console release is much later.

717
00:45:59,060 --> 00:46:01,100
Then why the fuck did it show us console controls?

718
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:04,320
And now, here is the reveal of a new game from Tarsier Studios.

719
00:46:04,660 --> 00:46:07,060
The creators of Little Nightmares 1 and 2.

720
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:08,420
Oh!

721
00:46:19,370 --> 00:46:20,610
Oh, I'm looking forward to this.

722
00:46:20,790 --> 00:46:22,450
I like the Little Nightmares franchise.

723
00:46:23,070 --> 00:46:24,070
It's a very good franchise.

724
00:46:27,470 --> 00:46:28,370
I wonder if you can-

725
00:46:36,030 --> 00:46:40,590
Like, I know it has co-op, but I feel like it really- I don't know.

726
00:46:40,670 --> 00:46:43,930
I sort of want to play this single player, but I'm not sure yet.

727
00:46:44,110 --> 00:46:51,450
Because I feel like- I feel definitely it'll be more immersive as, like, a single- Playing single player.

728
00:46:51,770 --> 00:46:55,130
Because, like, when you're playing co-op, it gets- Gets a little silly.

729
00:47:00,530 --> 00:47:02,870
We start getting a little silly.

730
00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:10,700
Oh, shit.

731
00:47:16,180 --> 00:47:18,360
I really do enjoy- Oh!

732
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:21,760
Re- Re- Re- Renimal?

733
00:47:22,060 --> 00:47:23,860
Wait, it's not called Little Nightmares 3?

734
00:47:25,220 --> 00:47:26,680
That was Re-Animal.

735
00:47:26,820 --> 00:47:29,600
The next big entry in the cozy game genre.

736
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:31,820
Re-Animal.

Today, Genshin Impact.

745
00:48:00,540 --> 00:48:06,800
is unveiling more about the sixth nation of Natalan, which will be released on August 28th.

746
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:11,880
And we also have some news about when the game will be coming to Xbox.

747
00:48:13,580 --> 00:48:15,420
People still play on the Xbox?

748
00:48:29,410 --> 00:48:31,050
But which one?

749
00:48:31,470 --> 00:48:33,070
Xbox 3?

750
00:48:33,190 --> 00:48:35,910
There's so many Xbox names.

751
00:48:35,910 --> 00:48:37,190
Like, I already lost track.

752
00:48:38,430 --> 00:48:40,070
Oh, that's a cute design.

753
00:48:40,190 --> 00:48:41,090
Oh, my God.

754
00:48:41,150 --> 00:48:42,230
Wait, she's so cute.

755
00:48:43,790 --> 00:48:46,630
Wait, I actually really like her palette.

756
00:48:46,930 --> 00:48:48,910
Her color palette is really cute.

757
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:02,720
I don't play Genshin, but I have to admit, they have some really good character designs.

758
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:04,200
Oh, shit.

759
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:05,220
Now it's Monster Hunter?

760
00:49:05,740 --> 00:49:06,900
What the fuck?

761
00:49:29,580 --> 00:49:32,360
Yeah, it's like Pokemon Monster Hunter now.

762
00:49:50,090 --> 00:49:50,970
There you go.

763
00:49:50,970 --> 00:49:51,590
Jeff, are you okay?

764
00:49:53,910 --> 00:49:56,750
You're like, Jeff, the camera's on, Jeff.

765
00:49:57,110 --> 00:49:59,550
Jeff, the camera's on.

766
00:50:00,830 --> 00:50:03,790
Here at Gamescom, Capcom has an incredible booth.

767
00:50:04,210 --> 00:50:12,010
But now, to tell us more and show us more, please welcome to the Gamescom ONL stage, Ryozo Tujimoto from Capcom.

768
00:50:12,130 --> 00:50:12,650
Ryozo-san.

769
00:50:13,790 --> 00:50:15,350
Oh, Monster Hunter.

770
00:50:15,530 --> 00:50:16,990
Speaking of Monster Hunter.

771
00:50:17,930 --> 00:50:18,990
Here's Monster Hunter.

772
00:50:31,810 --> 00:50:36,230
Not gonna lie, I don't know if it's just because, like, I don't know.

773
00:50:37,270 --> 00:50:41,330
A lot of the releases they've shown so far, other than, like, RC car.

774
00:50:43,530 --> 00:50:45,630
I've been, like, mega, like...

775
00:50:46,990 --> 00:50:47,690
Ryozo-San, King of the Night Lights 8.

776
00:50:47,710 --> 00:50:50,910
I've got to share my new Monster Hunter Worlds trailer with everyone.

777
00:50:57,430 --> 00:50:58,370
I mean,

778
00:51:03,250 --> 00:51:07,190
like, their hype released, they're hype, they opened with Borderlands 4.

779
00:51:07,430 --> 00:51:13,010
But it's so awkward, because, like, everybody is, like, trashing Borderlands right now.

780
00:51:13,250 --> 00:51:14,590
I get so...

781
00:51:14,590 --> 00:51:16,770
So, like, the hype for...

782
00:51:16,770 --> 00:51:22,790
I feel like if, you know, the movie never came out, people would be, like, more excited.

783
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:35,100
The 3 sucked too.

784
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:38,800
I mean, the Tales of Borderlands was pretty decent from what I've heard.

785
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:40,780
Uh, the Telltale series.

786
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:45,400
Borderlands 3 is such a bad game.

787
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:53,540
Okay, like, I told you guys, my experience with Borderlands 3, I've only played it, like, once, but, like, um, with friends.

788
00:51:53,820 --> 00:52:00,380
And the thing is, the- my friends were already so high leveled and, like, that I couldn't even, like, play the game.

789
00:52:00,620 --> 00:52:02,140
I was just being dragged.

790
00:52:02,460 --> 00:52:04,620
Like, I- they're like, yeah, you should join us.

791
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:06,440
And then I was just- I was just there.

792
00:52:06,620 --> 00:52:10,540
Like, I couldn't even shoot my gun because I would get slapped and then I'd die.

793
00:52:10,780 --> 00:52:13,060
They would sneeze on me and I'd be fucking dead.

794
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:13,920
Like...

795
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:20,420
So, like, I never- I never got to actually experience Borderlands 3.

796
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:24,160
Yeah, they didn't start new characters.

797
00:52:24,380 --> 00:52:28,800
They were just like, all right, let me- let's get you, like, the best guns.

798
00:52:31,620 --> 00:52:32,900
And I was just like, okay.

799
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:40,480
I feel like- what was it?

800
00:52:40,580 --> 00:52:42,000
I remember they had the- what was it called?

801
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:42,800
The Tina...

802
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:44,680
Tiny Tina's whatever.

803
00:52:45,220 --> 00:52:47,140
I heard that one wasn't good too.

804
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:50,520
Anebex Predator?

805
00:52:50,620 --> 00:52:51,500
Is he top 750?

806
00:52:57,280 --> 00:52:58,740
Tiny Tina Wonderlands?

807
00:52:58,880 --> 00:52:59,560
It was great?

808
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:00,260
Oh, it was?

809
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:03,640
I feel like I didn't see a lot of people play that game.

810
00:53:09,850 --> 00:53:16,290
I like how it's like, Wonderlands was good IMO and then someone right below him was like, Wonderlands was bad!

811
00:53:19,170 --> 00:53:21,370
All right, so it was mixed reviews.

812
00:53:21,610 --> 00:53:22,130
I see.

813
00:53:22,370 --> 00:53:23,730
So it was mixed reviews.

814
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:34,520
It was a good DLC but terrible standalone game.

815
00:53:45,060 --> 00:53:45,580
Oh!

816
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:47,260
My favorite part.

817
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:48,220
The cooking.

818
00:53:49,140 --> 00:53:50,200
And the cats.

819
00:54:00,230 --> 00:54:01,270
Wait, what?

820
00:54:02,930 --> 00:54:03,750
Oh, okay.

821
00:54:03,850 --> 00:54:06,190
I was like- I was like, Tomb Raider?

822
00:54:06,350 --> 00:54:07,950
But I was like, that's not Tomb Raider graphics.

823
00:54:07,950 --> 00:54:08,170
Oh, I see.

824
00:54:08,210 --> 00:54:08,210
I was like, Tomb Raider?

825
00:54:08,210 --> 00:54:08,210
But I was like, that's not Tomb Raider graphics.

826
00:54:12,190 --> 00:54:12,790
Destiny.

827
00:54:14,330 --> 00:54:15,550
Everything lost.

828
00:54:15,910 --> 00:54:17,730
I wish Naraka was...

829
00:54:17,730 --> 00:54:19,270
...is meant to be found.

830
00:54:19,290 --> 00:54:21,350
I wish Naraka was popular in the West.

831
00:54:21,950 --> 00:54:23,950
It's so dead in the West.

832
00:54:24,070 --> 00:54:26,730
But I heard it has a good player base in Asia.

833
00:54:34,210 --> 00:54:38,250
Naraka is basically like melee battle royale.

834
00:54:38,490 --> 00:54:40,670
A little taste of Shiranui Fire?

835
00:54:56,630 --> 00:54:57,230
Woah!

836
00:54:57,810 --> 00:54:58,370
Whoa.

837
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:01,190
Whoa!

838
00:55:02,630 --> 00:55:03,190
Okay.

839
00:55:09,690 --> 00:55:10,530
The camera!

840
00:55:11,950 --> 00:55:15,110
I was not expecting the camera angles.

841
00:55:15,350 --> 00:55:17,690
Oh, but it's not on Amazon games, so what's the point?

842
00:55:20,630 --> 00:55:21,610
What's the point?

843
00:55:21,710 --> 00:55:23,770
It's not on Amazon games, guys!

844
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:47,180
It's a publisher, not a storefront, but then, one of the games advertised to Amazon games, and you could get it there!

845
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:49,620
What's this?

846
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:51,080
This is Mecha, right?

847
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:59,100
I hope this game doesn't die like Gundam Evolution.

848
00:56:12,910 --> 00:56:14,750
Too soon, Toki!

849
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:31,920
I never got to try out... the sad thing is I never got to try out Gundam EVO, because there's so many rules when it came to streaming it, and I couldn't be bothered at that point.

850
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:38,700
Exciting for fans of Monument Valley, the beautiful twisted puzzle game that we all played about a decade ago, when it was first released in 2014.

851
00:56:39,020 --> 00:56:46,840
Well tonight, we are revealing Monument Valley 3, coming later this year from Us 2 in London and Netflix Games.

852
00:56:47,060 --> 00:56:50,220
I played this, it is an absolutely beautiful, stunning game.

853
00:56:50,220 --> 00:56:52,420
And we've got your first look right now.

854
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:54,600
What is this?

855
00:56:54,620 --> 00:56:55,420
Monument Valley?

856
00:56:56,620 --> 00:56:58,280
That's a cute game I'll never play.

857
00:57:01,430 --> 00:57:06,090
I know what my place is, and that seems like a lot of puzzles.

858
00:57:11,450 --> 00:57:14,670
I know it'll definitely fit others.

859
00:57:14,730 --> 00:57:20,750
Others would enjoy it, but for me, my Oonga-Bonga brain, don't think I can solve this...

860
00:57:32,100 --> 00:57:33,380
Bring to Monkye.

861
00:57:33,620 --> 00:57:35,140
I've returned to Monkye.

862
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:40,900
By the way, if you guys didn't see, I am streaming... Oh my god, big fish!

863
00:57:41,380 --> 00:57:45,140
I'm streaming Wukong tomorrow and Saturday.

864
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:47,180
Today is Monkye week.

865
00:57:49,900 --> 00:57:51,520
We're returning to Monkye.

866
00:57:52,780 --> 00:57:54,020
Oh, Netflix games!

867
00:58:05,380 --> 00:58:14,020
Now, first released in 1991, Civilization is one of the gaming industry's biggest franchises.

868
00:58:14,260 --> 00:58:21,220
And here at Gamescom, we are revealing the gameplay of Civilization 7 for the first time.

869
00:58:21,560 --> 00:58:22,980
You know what's great about that?

870
00:58:23,140 --> 00:58:25,040
That means Civ is not going to be on sale.

871
00:58:25,220 --> 00:58:27,000
Civ 6 is going to be on sale soon.

872
00:58:35,950 --> 00:58:37,750
But I already bought Civ 6.

873
00:58:40,090 --> 00:58:45,170
I believe that it's been almost eight years since Fraxis released our last Civilization game.

874
00:58:45,390 --> 00:58:52,230
So we're incredibly honored to be here tonight at Gamescom talking about Civilization 7.

875
00:58:52,230 --> 00:58:55,290
Yeah, but that means they're going to be even cheaper.

876
00:58:59,210 --> 00:59:05,450
Civ 7 is by far the biggest, most ambitious game Fraxis has ever made.

877
00:59:05,530 --> 00:59:05,910
Oh god.

878
00:59:06,310 --> 00:59:07,890
You shouldn't say that.

879
00:59:08,070 --> 00:59:09,530
Because what if it sucks?

880
00:59:11,650 --> 00:59:14,790
No, you're going to put too much expectations now!

881
00:59:15,010 --> 00:59:16,250
What if it sucks?

882
00:59:17,030 --> 00:59:23,250
Please join us after opening night live on the Fraxis Game Twitch channel for our official gameplay showcase.

883
00:59:23,250 --> 00:59:24,510
Go to our Twitch channel.

884
00:59:24,730 --> 00:59:30,670
Where we'll deep dive into what's new in Civ 7 and finally reveal our new in-game narrator.

885
00:59:31,890 --> 00:59:39,370
On behalf of the team at Fraxis Games, who has worked so hard on this game, I'm so excited to finally give the world...

886
00:59:39,370 --> 00:59:41,450
Bro, he's self-promoting his own channel?

887
00:59:41,450 --> 00:59:43,770
Sid Meier's Civilization 7.

888
00:59:44,170 --> 00:59:47,470
Follow my Twitch channel.

889
00:59:52,450 --> 00:59:56,970
I respect the hustle.

890
00:59:58,990 --> 01:00:00,070
Oh, I would.

891
01:00:00,130 --> 01:00:01,110
I would definitely do the same.

892
01:00:01,610 --> 01:00:05,250
I was just surprised that he did it.

893
01:00:11,450 --> 01:00:15,590
Somebody in chat is like, where is Silksong?

894
01:00:16,050 --> 01:00:17,210
Bro, stop.

895
01:00:19,530 --> 01:00:21,570
Give up in the dream.

896
01:00:25,790 --> 01:00:27,290
The dream's dead.

897
01:00:28,170 --> 01:00:29,130
Accept it.

898
01:00:30,090 --> 01:00:31,590
You're all in denial.

899
01:00:40,660 --> 01:00:42,560
Jeff said there's no Silksong.

900
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:47,020
I love whenever Jeff was like, there's going to be no Kingdom Hearts news.

901
01:00:47,020 --> 01:00:48,920
And then people were like, he's lying!

902
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:54,260
And then Jeff said again, there's no Silksong news.

903
01:00:54,560 --> 01:00:55,360
He's lying!

904
01:00:56,680 --> 01:01:00,060
This is definitely where he's lying for real.

905
01:01:10,170 --> 01:01:12,570
And there was no Kingdom Hearts news.

906
01:01:24,490 --> 01:01:25,750
What's the new part?

907
01:01:26,010 --> 01:01:27,230
I couldn't tell.

908
01:01:27,370 --> 01:01:28,690
It just looked like Sid.

909
01:01:35,660 --> 01:01:38,320
Ever since we first reached for the stars.

910
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:41,660
That's the secret, Ducky.

911
01:01:44,140 --> 01:01:45,620
We've been asking ourselves.

912
01:01:47,240 --> 01:01:48,100
Oh, space.

913
01:01:49,160 --> 01:01:51,160
What else is out there?

914
01:01:52,140 --> 01:01:55,640
And more importantly, can.

915
01:01:56,060 --> 01:01:56,700
Starfield?

916
01:01:57,220 --> 01:01:58,160
Drive on it.

917
01:01:58,160 --> 01:01:58,720
Is it Starfield?

918
01:02:00,760 --> 01:02:01,400
Wait!

919
01:02:02,940 --> 01:02:03,780
There he is!

920
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:06,540
Bam bam bam bam.

921
01:02:09,360 --> 01:02:10,920
Bam bam bam.

922
01:02:13,620 --> 01:02:14,420
Oh

923
01:02:24,430 --> 01:02:25,530
my god.

924
01:02:25,630 --> 01:02:26,710
My God.

925
01:02:26,730 --> 01:02:27,750
R.C.

926
01:02:27,750 --> 01:02:27,950
car.

927
01:02:28,110 --> 01:02:28,910
Electric tooloo.

928
01:02:31,630 --> 01:02:32,830
Is that the beach?

929
01:02:33,310 --> 01:02:35,630
Wait, I can go to the beach in space?

930
01:02:38,010 --> 01:02:38,810
Meow.

931
01:02:38,810 --> 01:02:40,470
Especially when you're juicy.

932
01:02:41,650 --> 01:02:42,950
AN adore it.

933
01:02:53,720 --> 01:02:56,780
Just a fucking... Yeah, but it's a cool car.

934
01:02:57,280 --> 01:02:58,480
You don't understand.

935
01:02:58,580 --> 01:02:59,340
And it's free.

936
01:02:59,460 --> 01:03:00,400
Wait, what the fuck?

937
01:03:00,680 --> 01:03:02,880
Oh my god, this car comes with fucking trauma.

938
01:03:15,100 --> 01:03:15,940
It's parents.

939
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:17,600
This car's parents died.

940
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:28,640
Tonight at ONL, we're revealing two new heroes who are joining the game with a first look at their gameplay.

941
01:03:29,160 --> 01:03:30,500
New more heroes?

942
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:33,940
I wonder how many heroes it's gonna be on launch.

943
01:03:37,860 --> 01:03:40,100
I mean, they added a shark in there.

944
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:48,080
Wait,

945
01:03:57,860 --> 01:03:58,080
what?

946
01:03:59,120 --> 01:04:00,400
No way!

947
01:04:02,440 --> 01:04:04,460
Bucky and Captain America?

948
01:04:08,760 --> 01:04:12,340
Oh my god, I hope they add Hawkeye so he can get his shit beat.

949
01:04:15,060 --> 01:04:19,120
Wait, does that mean all the Avengers are gonna show up too?

950
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:27,480
I hope they add Hawkeye so he can be like the Hanzo of Marvel Rivals, but he's just a regular guy.

951
01:04:39,040 --> 01:04:40,140
Oh, he's a tank.

952
01:04:40,360 --> 01:04:40,800
Okay.

953
01:04:40,900 --> 01:04:42,500
Is Captain America a tank?

954
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:42,980
What the?

955
01:04:43,080 --> 01:04:44,200
Wait, what is he?

956
01:04:45,940 --> 01:04:47,520
What the fuck?

957
01:04:47,840 --> 01:04:49,600
Okay, that looks overpowered.

958
01:04:49,800 --> 01:04:52,720
That looks so overpowered.

959
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:56,980
That looks so overpowered.

960
01:04:56,980 --> 01:04:57,760
Wait, what?

961
01:05:03,080 --> 01:05:03,660
Alright.

962
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:07,380
Bucky and Captain...

963
01:05:07,380 --> 01:05:10,140
Well, they must add the rest of the Avengers, right?

964
01:05:10,440 --> 01:05:10,600
Well, they must add the rest of the Avengers, right?

965
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:13,020
So we're missing, like, Hawkeye and Black Widow.

966
01:05:13,020 --> 01:05:13,220
So we're missing, like, Hawkeye and Black Widow.

967
01:05:13,220 --> 01:05:19,020
I'm sure everyone who played the beta wanted to know Marvel Rivals will launch on December 6th, 2024.

968
01:05:20,060 --> 01:05:34,520
Now, Gamescom always strives to help the environment and the event runs on 100% renewable energy and is climate friendly thanks to ongoing measures to reduce I want Hawkeye to join just for just to have people be mad at Hanzo mains again.

969
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:36,960
Hanzo mains will...

970
01:05:37,700 --> 01:05:39,840
Every game will have a Hanzo main.

971
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:42,780
And yes, fans are planting more and more trees in the Gamescom forest.

972
01:05:42,780 --> 01:05:44,760
The forest has been growing since...

973
01:05:44,760 --> 01:05:46,040
We're also missing a sniper.

974
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:48,320
We're missing an actual sniper, too.

975
01:05:48,740 --> 01:05:51,860
Of course, you can plant your tree in the Gamescom forest today.

976
01:05:52,500 --> 01:05:54,320
And with that, it is time to...

977
01:05:54,320 --> 01:05:56,500
Yeah, every game needs a Hanzo.

978
01:05:57,320 --> 01:06:03,580
This award celebrates an organization in the global game industry committed to sustainability and the environment.

979
01:06:04,520 --> 01:06:08,480
Presenting the award, please welcome back Lisa Pak with Playing for the Planet.

980
01:06:08,900 --> 01:06:09,740
What the...

981
01:06:09,740 --> 01:06:14,720
I was like, did my PC do I have something playing?

982
01:06:15,040 --> 01:06:17,260
Because the music played while she was talking.

983
01:06:17,540 --> 01:06:19,220
Thank you for having me here.

984
01:06:19,220 --> 01:06:22,220
It's an absolute pleasure, Lisa.

985
01:06:22,500 --> 01:06:34,620
And in case some people don't know and need a quick refresher, Lisa represents Playing for the Planet, an alliance of gaming organizations committed to taking climate action under the official umbrella of the United Nations.

986
01:06:34,820 --> 01:06:35,820
So how are things, Lisa?

987
01:06:36,080 --> 01:06:37,920
Things are going great, thank you.

988
01:06:38,040 --> 01:06:46,220
With 3.3 billion people around the world playing video games, we encourage everyone to make a difference wherever possible.

989
01:06:46,460 --> 01:06:49,920
Absolutely, and 3.3 billion players is so, so much.

990
01:06:50,120 --> 01:06:53,700
So do you have any tips for our players on supporting this great initiative?

991
01:06:54,060 --> 01:06:55,140
Yes, definitely.

992
01:06:55,440 --> 01:07:02,060
It's as easy as remembering to set up energy saving modes to avoid unnecessary energy consumption.

993
01:07:02,420 --> 01:07:04,800
Or switching to renewable energy...

994
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:10,600
I was thinking, I was like, why is video games connected to the environment?

995
01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:22,500
Because I'm pretty sure we're using so much energy and carbon footprint and everything so I felt like that was counterintuitive and then they're like, remember to play an energy saving mode.

996
01:07:22,800 --> 01:07:22,980
I don't know.

997
01:07:28,580 --> 01:07:31,700
The amount of energy I'm fucking generating.

998
01:07:33,740 --> 01:07:42,080
And turning it into emission reductions demands a clear and actionable plan as well as collaboration.

999
01:07:42,740 --> 01:07:50,400
And this year's winner has proven that it's possible to deliver ambition with execution across the board.

1000
01:07:50,980 --> 01:07:56,220
And this year's winner of the Gamescom Sustainability Award is Tencent Games.

1001
01:07:56,560 --> 01:08:01,560
And here to accept the award is Brent Irvine, the Vice Chairman of Tencent Games.

1002
01:08:03,870 --> 01:08:05,020
What did they win?

1003
01:08:12,120 --> 01:08:16,340
Well, first of all, let me say on behalf of Tencent Games how honored we are to receive this award.

1004
01:08:17,340 --> 01:08:19,880
Tencent Games encompasses a lot of things.

1005
01:08:19,980 --> 01:08:26,860
Everything from in-house studios like Timmy, global studios like Shark Mob, to our global publishing arm, Level Infinite.

1006
01:08:27,100 --> 01:08:30,680
What they all share is a commitment to operating our business in a sustainable way.

1007
01:08:30,920 --> 01:08:48,340
We are committed to carbon neutrality by 2030 and really want to thank all of our studios, all of our partners, but most of all, all of our players whose support is essential in helping us drive our efforts to have positive change within the industry.

1008
01:08:48,480 --> 01:08:49,880
Thanks again and back to the games.

1009
01:08:50,160 --> 01:08:52,700
Congratulations Tencent and Brent Irvine!

1010
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,120
I'm so confused with this segment.

1011
01:09:02,440 --> 01:09:04,720
I'm so confused with this segment.

1012
01:09:12,450 --> 01:09:13,780
Because it's like...

1013
01:09:14,860 --> 01:09:15,980
I don't know.

1014
01:09:16,780 --> 01:09:19,980
Playing video games is not really about like...

1015
01:09:19,980 --> 01:09:25,020
Is it fuck to say playing video games is not really about saving the environment?

1016
01:09:25,620 --> 01:09:26,940
Is that...

1017
01:09:26,940 --> 01:09:27,540
Is that...

1018
01:09:27,540 --> 01:09:28,240
Is that...

1019
01:09:29,400 --> 01:09:32,320
There's just no correlation in a way.

1020
01:09:44,940 --> 01:09:48,060
There's just no correlation in a way.

1021
01:09:48,480 --> 01:09:50,280
Doki hates the environment.

1022
01:09:51,020 --> 01:09:51,040
Doki hates the environment.

1023
01:09:51,580 --> 01:09:52,360
I just didn't see like...

1024
01:09:52,360 --> 01:09:54,060
There being like a matchup.

1025
01:09:54,640 --> 01:09:57,140
That's why I was like so confused with the segment.

1026
01:09:57,340 --> 01:10:01,240
We do this because we fucking love video games.

1027
01:10:01,300 --> 01:10:02,140
Oh, he's gonna cry!

1028
01:10:03,820 --> 01:10:05,980
He fucking loves video games.

1029
01:10:08,160 --> 01:10:08,680
He fucking loves video games.

1030
01:10:08,680 --> 01:10:13,640
And every time a trailer comes online, And every time a trailer comes online, we see hundreds and hundreds of comments from the fans.

1031
01:10:13,860 --> 01:10:15,960
Like, why don't we see a movie like this?

1032
01:10:16,040 --> 01:10:17,920
Or why can't we have a series like this?

1033
01:10:18,060 --> 01:10:19,800
And we could not agree more.

1034
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:24,180
Which is why we are so excited to share this series with you.

1035
01:10:24,620 --> 01:10:34,120
Fifteen original episodes created in collaboration with Amazon Studios and the publishers and developers of some of the world's greatest games.

1036
01:10:34,340 --> 01:10:39,800
I'm talking new titles, existing games, indies, and classics.

1037
01:10:40,120 --> 01:10:43,300
So, we've been working on this show for three years.

1038
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:45,480
Which one is this?

1039
01:10:45,880 --> 01:10:46,900
Choked up, sorry.

1040
01:10:47,680 --> 01:10:49,040
I cry a lot.

1041
01:10:51,400 --> 01:10:52,640
He's passionate.

1042
01:10:53,200 --> 01:10:54,180
He's passionate.

1043
01:10:54,680 --> 01:10:55,800
He's passionate.

1044
01:11:00,790 --> 01:11:01,430
Alright.

1045
01:11:01,770 --> 01:11:03,530
We've been working on it for three years.

1046
01:11:03,650 --> 01:11:11,430
Oh, I hope it's good because I feel really bad if people review Bomb It after the fucking passion he gave.

1047
01:11:12,690 --> 01:11:14,610
He literally cried for it.

1048
01:11:14,870 --> 01:11:16,610
I hope it's good now.

1049
01:11:18,830 --> 01:11:20,630
For his sake.

1050
01:11:23,880 --> 01:11:26,520
It is our love letter to games.

1051
01:11:26,740 --> 01:11:31,400
And you can watch the series on Amazon Prime Video on December 10th.

1052
01:11:31,420 --> 01:11:32,440
Not too far now.

1053
01:11:32,620 --> 01:11:33,480
So, enjoy.

1054
01:11:33,740 --> 01:11:34,380
Thank you.

1055
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:35,560
Wait.

1056
01:11:36,120 --> 01:11:37,380
It's a new series.

1057
01:11:38,840 --> 01:11:40,460
Wait, is this Warhammer?

1058
01:11:42,660 --> 01:11:43,340
Brothers!

1059
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:47,320
Brothers!

1060
01:11:48,400 --> 01:11:49,300
It's time.

1061
01:11:51,740 --> 01:11:54,180
This world has waited for your arrival.

1062
01:11:54,440 --> 01:11:55,660
Is this an anthology?

1063
01:11:56,460 --> 01:11:58,580
From the visionaries behind Love, Death...

1064
01:11:58,580 --> 01:12:00,000
Oh, is this an anthology?

1065
01:12:00,340 --> 01:12:02,020
Of like different video games?

1066
01:12:02,300 --> 01:12:02,740
It is you.

1067
01:12:06,170 --> 01:12:07,790
Oh, I think it is.

1068
01:12:08,430 --> 01:12:08,890
You are the chosen.

1069
01:12:09,970 --> 01:12:11,650
Oh, that looks so sick.

1070
01:12:15,910 --> 01:12:16,470
Moments.

1071
01:12:18,630 --> 01:12:19,190
Okay.

1072
01:12:19,190 --> 01:12:19,510
Okay.

1073
01:12:19,850 --> 01:12:20,650
I'm gonna say it.

1074
01:12:20,730 --> 01:12:23,850
Love, Death, Robots season 1 and 2 were pretty good.

1075
01:12:24,330 --> 01:12:24,770
Wait.

1076
01:12:25,170 --> 01:12:26,770
How many seasons does Love, Death, Robots?

1077
01:12:26,850 --> 01:12:27,770
Season 1 was really good.

1078
01:12:27,910 --> 01:12:30,150
And then the later season started getting a little bit eh.

1079
01:12:42,860 --> 01:12:44,020
So I hope like...

1080
01:12:44,020 --> 01:12:46,720
I think like if it's the first season it will be really good.

1081
01:12:47,420 --> 01:12:50,080
Because I love the first season of Love, Death, Robots.

1082
01:12:51,720 --> 01:12:52,720
This looks so...

1083
01:12:52,720 --> 01:12:53,800
Oh my Spelunky!

1084
01:12:54,360 --> 01:12:54,960
Oh wait!

1085
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:55,840
Did you...

1086
01:12:56,730 --> 01:12:57,800
There's Spelunky!

1087
01:13:02,620 --> 01:13:03,480
I

1088
01:13:07,240 --> 01:13:09,060
can't believe it.

1089
01:13:09,740 --> 01:13:11,460
Yeah, there's our record.

1090
01:13:14,550 --> 01:13:16,440
Try not to disappoint us.

1091
01:13:17,560 --> 01:13:19,280
Oh no.

1092
01:13:19,400 --> 01:13:22,240
Why did they have to show this trailer right after?

1093
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:23,860
Oh...

1094
01:13:23,860 --> 01:13:25,540
This looks like...

1095
01:13:33,800 --> 01:13:34,980
I feel bad.

1096
01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:36,580
If it wasn't...

1097
01:13:36,580 --> 01:13:41,800
If it did not come after the other trailer, this shit might look a lot better.

1098
01:13:49,060 --> 01:13:50,800
Is this Age of...

1099
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:52,680
Age of Empires?

1100
01:13:53,320 --> 01:13:54,500
Age of Mythology?

1101
01:14:04,670 --> 01:14:06,030
Is this a remaster?

1102
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:13,900
That's awkward for them to come after.

1103
01:14:14,300 --> 01:14:14,960
Yeah.

1104
01:14:15,140 --> 01:14:16,060
This is so awkward.

1105
01:14:16,180 --> 01:14:23,340
I feel like if this game was like not right after the trailer we just got, I feel like people would be more hyped.

1106
01:14:23,500 --> 01:14:26,700
But now there's like comparison between like the graphics and stuff.

1107
01:14:27,440 --> 01:14:27,640
Yeah.

1108
01:14:35,920 --> 01:14:39,240
This is Age of Empires slash Age of Mythology.

1109
01:14:39,360 --> 01:14:41,500
I remember we used to play Age of Mythology too.

1110
01:14:42,320 --> 01:14:43,240
I enjoyed it.

1111
01:14:45,140 --> 01:14:50,100
I hope they don't fuck it up like the World of Warcraft RTS game.

1112
01:14:50,520 --> 01:14:54,800
To be fair, it's not Blizzard so I say as I'm gonna be streaming Overwatch later today.

1113
01:15:00,680 --> 01:15:03,360
You know what I want a remaster of for RTS?

1114
01:15:03,740 --> 01:15:05,000
The Lord of the Rings one.

1115
01:15:05,160 --> 01:15:06,800
I used to play that shit all the time.

1116
01:15:07,100 --> 01:15:12,320
The Lord of the Rings RTS was so fun back then.

1117
01:15:12,360 --> 01:15:14,200
I used to play that all the time.

1118
01:15:14,580 --> 01:15:17,180
Like every day when it first came out.

1119
01:15:17,260 --> 01:15:19,040
And I had all the expansion packs too.

1120
01:15:19,780 --> 01:15:21,280
Was it Battle for Middle Earth?

1121
01:15:21,360 --> 01:15:25,260
I don't remember the title but I never got a remaster and I was so sad.

1122
01:15:25,660 --> 01:15:29,500
I've always wanted a remaster or just a port of it.

1123
01:15:32,420 --> 01:15:32,900
Yeah.

1124
01:15:32,900 --> 01:15:34,660
Battle for Middle Earth 1 and 2.

1125
01:15:34,740 --> 01:15:36,040
It was so fucking good.

1126
01:15:36,280 --> 01:15:38,220
I love the story missions.

1127
01:15:38,680 --> 01:15:41,200
The campaign and the individuals too.

1128
01:15:42,760 --> 01:15:45,580
And you know damn well I was only playing the bad guys.

1129
01:15:46,180 --> 01:15:48,200
The elves weren't that fun.

1130
01:15:48,380 --> 01:15:54,900
The elves and the humans weren't as fun as the bad guys.

1131
01:15:55,280 --> 01:16:00,880
They had such cool like really cool units.

1132
01:16:06,120 --> 01:16:07,080
Yeah.

1133
01:16:11,500 --> 01:16:16,400
I like the the um...

1134
01:16:16,400 --> 01:16:19,320
And then you get to have like dragons flying around too.

1135
01:16:27,530 --> 01:16:29,830
I did not pay attention to this trailer.

1136
01:16:31,430 --> 01:16:34,110
I did not pay attention to that game.

1137
01:16:34,190 --> 01:16:37,010
I have no idea what that game was.

1138
01:16:41,430 --> 01:16:49,710
It looked so generic that like my mind just tuned it out.

1139
01:16:51,850 --> 01:16:58,830
Oh this is the trailer where like the insurgents like medieval banging in the middle of it.

1140
01:17:00,050 --> 01:17:01,890
And then it like caught me off guard.

1141
01:17:04,550 --> 01:17:07,090
From the last like what was it?

1142
01:17:07,150 --> 01:17:08,290
From the Game Awards?

1143
01:17:10,010 --> 01:17:11,590
Or the Summer Game Fest?

1144
01:17:12,730 --> 01:17:13,290
Yeah.

1145
01:17:13,430 --> 01:17:16,330
Like we watched this trailer for this game.

1146
01:17:16,390 --> 01:17:17,570
For Summer Game Fest.

1147
01:17:17,690 --> 01:17:20,630
And then there was like medieval banging in the middle of it.

1148
01:17:21,510 --> 01:17:23,050
And I was like what the fuck?

1149
01:17:28,750 --> 01:17:30,310
Henry's just like okay.

1150
01:17:33,230 --> 01:17:34,350
I remember.

1151
01:17:38,090 --> 01:17:40,350
That's what they... I hope that's what they did.

1152
01:17:40,470 --> 01:17:41,990
That's how we have babies.

1153
01:17:45,490 --> 01:17:48,430
Yes babies do not come from storks I'm afraid.

1154
01:17:48,730 --> 01:17:51,770
They're not brought by big ass birds.

1155
01:17:51,970 --> 01:17:52,770
I'm sorry guys.

1156
01:17:53,010 --> 01:17:54,490
I could break it to you.

1157
01:17:58,290 --> 01:17:58,850
What?

1158
01:18:01,250 --> 01:18:04,430
But what about the animated storks movie?

1159
01:18:06,130 --> 01:18:11,250
I love how that movie is getting popular because of the who would win.

1160
01:18:11,470 --> 01:18:14,790
All the Pokemon in the world are like one million lions.

1161
01:18:15,390 --> 01:18:20,330
And then they're like the lions could be like that wolf pack from the storks movie.

1162
01:18:21,290 --> 01:18:23,290
Wolf pack make a play.

1163
01:18:24,030 --> 01:18:28,650
And now we've got the debut of a brand new area of new eridu.

1164
01:18:28,750 --> 01:18:29,470
Check it out.

1165
01:18:32,840 --> 01:18:34,380
It's a billion lions.

1166
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:36,380
It's a lot of lions.

1167
01:18:36,580 --> 01:18:36,840
Okay.

1168
01:18:43,440 --> 01:18:51,860
And then like the argument for Pokemon was that if we're talking about variations there is like four billion Spinda variations.

1169
01:18:52,140 --> 01:18:53,280
So like...

1170
01:18:53,280 --> 01:18:55,340
I love that.

1171
01:18:55,340 --> 01:18:56,480
I was like...

1172
01:18:58,120 --> 01:18:58,640
Nerds!

1173
01:19:24,680 --> 01:19:26,040
Is that a rat?

1174
01:19:27,140 --> 01:19:28,300
Is that a rat girl?

1175
01:19:30,780 --> 01:19:31,760
I'm not surprised.

1176
01:19:31,940 --> 01:19:33,820
I heard their shark girl was so popular.

1177
01:19:36,640 --> 01:19:47,920
I always say this but I always feel like especially for like um like character designs if you make it like an animal girl it's gonna be super popular.

1178
01:20:03,210 --> 01:20:03,850
Wait.

1179
01:20:04,150 --> 01:20:09,550
Why did mom let you have three Hoyo verse ads?

1180
01:20:10,250 --> 01:20:12,490
How much money did they give Jeff?

1181
01:20:16,010 --> 01:20:17,110
Holy shit.

1182
01:20:17,170 --> 01:20:18,190
Is this Honkai Staria?

1183
01:20:19,630 --> 01:20:20,950
Probably a lot.

1184
01:20:20,950 --> 01:20:21,410
True.

1185
01:20:21,530 --> 01:20:22,290
They make a lot.

1186
01:20:22,530 --> 01:20:23,190
It's gacha.

1187
01:20:25,830 --> 01:20:26,750
This is like...

1188
01:20:26,750 --> 01:20:31,710
If you guys don't know this is why gacha companies sponsor so many things and people.

1189
01:20:32,130 --> 01:20:33,230
Because all they...

1190
01:20:33,230 --> 01:20:33,890
It doesn't matter.

1191
01:20:34,970 --> 01:20:40,450
Since they're a gacha game it doesn't matter if they have one person playing the game.

1192
01:20:40,550 --> 01:20:44,630
They sold the game to one person from these ads.

1193
01:20:44,630 --> 01:20:48,150
Because that one person is gonna spend so much money on gacha alone.

1194
01:20:57,330 --> 01:20:57,890
Yeah.

1195
01:20:57,890 --> 01:20:59,730
One will is all they need.

1196
01:21:05,170 --> 01:21:07,790
It's similar with like I told you guys before.

1197
01:21:07,950 --> 01:21:10,290
It's similar with like gambling sponsors.

1198
01:21:10,950 --> 01:21:12,590
I know how much they pay.

1199
01:21:13,170 --> 01:21:21,170
They never reached out to me but I have friends who have... who were reached out by gambling sponsors.

1200
01:21:21,610 --> 01:21:23,710
And it is an absurd amount.

1201
01:21:24,250 --> 01:21:26,950
Because all they need is to hook one person.

1202
01:21:33,570 --> 01:21:34,590
It's like...

1203
01:21:34,590 --> 01:21:35,950
I'll just say it's like...

1204
01:21:35,950 --> 01:21:39,810
It's an amount of money that you just be like holy fuck.

1205
01:21:40,950 --> 01:21:53,430
Like if you get sponsored by a gambling like gambling game or like company like casino or whatever.

1206
01:21:53,990 --> 01:21:57,550
Like you're literally one stream like one sponsor from them.

1207
01:21:57,610 --> 01:21:58,410
You're set for life.

1208
01:21:58,530 --> 01:21:59,670
You don't have to stream anymore.

1209
01:21:59,890 --> 01:22:03,610
... has done an incredible job bringing the world and combat into VR.

1210
01:22:03,910 --> 01:22:06,890
And here is your first look at the actual gameplay.

1211
01:22:06,890 --> 01:22:09,610
A gameplay trailer for Batman Arkham Shadow.

1212
01:22:10,310 --> 01:22:10,870
...

1213
01:22:16,440 --> 01:22:19,120
Oh is this a VR game that everyone is sad about?

1214
01:22:19,760 --> 01:22:19,820
...

1215
01:22:27,760 --> 01:22:29,320
Why does the graphic look...

1216
01:22:29,320 --> 01:22:29,780
...

1217
01:22:30,760 --> 01:22:31,400
...

1218
01:22:32,780 --> 01:22:37,260
I don't even... I want this to stay in VR because this graphics look...

1219
01:22:37,540 --> 01:22:37,860
...

1220
01:22:37,860 --> 01:22:38,280
...

1221
01:22:38,280 --> 01:22:39,300
...

1222
01:22:40,600 --> 01:22:41,240
...

1223
01:22:41,240 --> 01:22:41,360
...

1224
01:22:41,360 --> 01:22:41,600
...

1225
01:22:41,600 --> 01:22:41,620
...

1226
01:22:41,620 --> 01:22:41,700
...

1227
01:22:41,700 --> 01:22:42,060
...

1228
01:22:42,060 --> 01:22:42,440
...

1229
01:23:00,980 --> 01:23:01,540
...

1230
01:23:01,540 --> 01:23:01,560
...

1231
01:23:03,420 --> 01:23:03,980
...

1232
01:23:06,700 --> 01:23:07,260
...

1233
01:23:08,180 --> 01:23:08,740
...

1234
01:23:10,260 --> 01:23:14,940
I'm pretty sure in VR you wouldn't care about it though because you are here to be Batman.

1235
01:23:15,360 --> 01:23:15,440
...

1236
01:23:17,640 --> 01:23:19,580
Oh God that looks so tiring.

1237
01:23:19,940 --> 01:23:20,500
...

1238
01:23:23,420 --> 01:23:26,520
You know because like Batman you need to punch right?

1239
01:23:26,620 --> 01:23:27,660
You can't shoot anything.

1240
01:23:28,020 --> 01:23:29,760
I'm just thinking this is going to be...

1241
01:23:29,780 --> 01:23:30,280
This could be a workout.

1242
01:23:32,020 --> 01:23:36,300
Yeah, it looks like a workout.

1243
01:23:51,320 --> 01:23:56,640
Oh god, this definitely looks like a workout.

1244
01:23:56,640 --> 01:23:59,020
Ha ha ha, the punching.

1245
01:24:01,860 --> 01:24:02,420
Whoa.

1246
01:24:02,420 --> 01:24:02,980
Rats.

1247
01:24:03,180 --> 01:24:04,320
Become the knight.

1248
01:24:05,540 --> 01:24:09,580
It makes me wonder though, like, will they even have a lot of people?

1249
01:24:09,800 --> 01:24:14,340
Because it's like, VR is... oh my god, I forgot it's on fucking MetaQuest.

1250
01:24:15,440 --> 01:24:16,000
BOOOOM!

1251
01:24:18,460 --> 01:24:19,580
Fucking BOOOOM!

1252
01:24:19,900 --> 01:24:21,180
Fuck you, Facebook.

1253
01:24:24,480 --> 01:24:26,340
I was like, I thought about it.

1254
01:24:26,420 --> 01:24:28,460
I was like, oh yeah, maybe I should try it out.

1255
01:24:29,020 --> 01:24:32,380
I was like, oh yeah, I forgot it was on MetaQuest.

1256
01:24:32,420 --> 01:24:33,640
God fucking damn it.

1257
01:24:34,040 --> 01:24:34,560
Zuckerberg.

1258
01:24:34,820 --> 01:24:37,240
On both days with another 100,000 guests.

1259
01:24:37,560 --> 01:24:41,060
Now if you haven't been there yet, you should definitely go and check it out.

1260
01:24:41,460 --> 01:24:47,100
That is what's happening in Cologne and also people from more than 100 countries are here.

1261
01:24:47,440 --> 01:24:51,600
But, Gamescom has fans all over the world and I have good news.

1262
01:24:51,760 --> 01:24:54,260
Gamescom is heading to other continents!

1263
01:24:55,480 --> 01:25:03,440
The first Gamescom Latam took place in June and exceeded all of our expectations with over 100,000 fans immersed in the gaming universe.

1264
01:25:03,720 --> 01:25:07,720
It was a fantastic show and next year it's going to be even bigger.

1265
01:25:07,900 --> 01:25:09,040
Oh hey, Sao Paio!

1266
01:25:10,380 --> 01:25:12,980
Gamescom Asia returns this October.

1267
01:25:13,280 --> 01:25:19,580
You can join in on the fun and entertainment area to find out all about the games, the stages, the prospects, and much, much more.

1268
01:25:20,820 --> 01:25:22,820
Gamescom was not directed at me.

1269
01:25:23,560 --> 01:25:24,120
Gamescom was not directed at me.

1270
01:25:24,120 --> 01:25:24,240
Gamescom was not directed at me.

1271
01:25:24,240 --> 01:25:24,720
Why are you doing this?

1272
01:25:24,740 --> 01:25:26,600
Gamescom is back on the air on October 17th!

1273
01:25:28,140 --> 01:25:31,240
Now, who is ready for another world premiere!

1274
01:25:32,160 --> 01:25:33,320
Wait what about NA?

1275
01:25:34,020 --> 01:25:35,460
What about NA?

1276
01:25:36,060 --> 01:25:37,880
Stop wait!!

1277
01:25:39,760 --> 01:25:41,000
Little Nightmares!

1278
01:25:58,990 --> 01:26:03,130
I thought Re-Animal was Little Nightmares but like, re-branded into a new title.

1279
01:26:11,020 --> 01:26:12,500
So I guess they're making two games?

1280
01:26:22,690 --> 01:26:24,070
This is New Dez?

1281
01:26:26,230 --> 01:26:26,830
Oh...

1282
01:26:27,630 --> 01:26:28,790
Now I'm scared.

1283
01:26:57,190 --> 01:27:00,690
Okay, this is a little bit of a hot take.

1284
01:27:00,990 --> 01:27:02,650
But I saw Re-Animal first.

1285
01:27:03,390 --> 01:27:05,470
And the trailer first for it.

1286
01:27:05,730 --> 01:27:08,610
And Re-Animal looks so good.

1287
01:27:09,090 --> 01:27:10,930
Compared to Little Nightmares 3.

1288
01:27:15,550 --> 01:27:16,890
So I'm a little worried.

1289
01:27:19,710 --> 01:27:21,130
I'm just a little worried.

1290
01:27:38,940 --> 01:27:40,280
Are we gonna eat these cows?

1291
01:27:43,760 --> 01:27:46,720
Wouldn't it be funny to bring them all the way to whatever land?

1292
01:27:46,960 --> 01:27:47,740
And then we just eat them?

1293
01:27:48,820 --> 01:27:50,060
Because we're a shepherd, right?

1294
01:27:52,140 --> 01:27:53,020
A doggy?

1295
01:27:53,500 --> 01:27:53,940
What?

1296
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:54,980
It's a herding simulator.

1297
01:27:55,640 --> 01:27:56,760
Where the fuck am I herding?

1298
01:27:57,080 --> 01:28:01,080
You think when we herd the sheep, we're not gonna eat them later?

1299
01:28:02,700 --> 01:28:04,260
That's the whole point of herding.

1300
01:28:13,290 --> 01:28:15,690
I mean, for the wool and the meat, right?

1301
01:28:20,940 --> 01:28:22,020
Oh, did you guys know?

1302
01:28:23,260 --> 01:28:23,740
Um...

1303
01:28:23,740 --> 01:28:26,140
Wool doesn't make you that much money anymore.

1304
01:28:26,380 --> 01:28:29,020
I don't know if it's true, like, if it's updated.

1305
01:28:29,400 --> 01:28:33,800
But I read that, like, wool doesn't make you as much money anymore as it used to be.

1306
01:28:35,500 --> 01:28:38,800
So people don't usually own sheep for wool.

1307
01:28:41,040 --> 01:28:43,280
And tonight, he's here to reveal...

1308
01:28:43,280 --> 01:28:44,900
Yeah, the wool meta fell off, guys.

1309
01:28:45,420 --> 01:28:46,440
It's the meat meta.

1310
01:28:47,520 --> 01:28:51,800
Please join me, Gamescom, in welcoming to ONL Peter Molyneux.

1311
01:29:04,250 --> 01:29:05,030
He's back!

1312
01:29:06,570 --> 01:29:11,010
What an incredible honor it is to be here on the stage with Jeff.

1313
01:29:11,250 --> 01:29:11,870
Yes, Peter.

1314
01:29:12,090 --> 01:29:13,250
He's an amazing man.

1315
01:29:13,270 --> 01:29:14,410
This is so fun.

1316
01:29:14,630 --> 01:29:17,130
So a couple months ago, you and I had lunch in London.

1317
01:29:17,230 --> 01:29:18,010
I was like, what are you working on?

1318
01:29:18,070 --> 01:29:20,830
You're like, well, I've actually been working on a game for a number of years.

1319
01:29:20,830 --> 01:29:22,730
You've kept very quiet about it.

1320
01:29:22,750 --> 01:29:24,670
I really wanted to, like, the game speak for itself.

1321
01:29:24,890 --> 01:29:26,970
But tell us about Masters of Albion.

1322
01:29:27,150 --> 01:29:28,510
Right, so...

1323
01:29:28,510 --> 01:29:33,710
I love that people's first message is like, don't believe this man!

1324
01:29:34,270 --> 01:29:38,790
There's so many first messages where everyone's like, he's lying!

1325
01:29:47,570 --> 01:29:49,250
Believe his lies!

1326
01:29:50,830 --> 01:29:55,250
This is the very first message on the stream.

1327
01:29:56,670 --> 01:30:00,270
To your credit, you've self-funded this project yourself.

1328
01:30:00,270 --> 01:30:03,330
You put together a team of a lot of veterans from those games.

1329
01:30:03,410 --> 01:30:08,850
Yeah, I mean, I think my first realization is I needed to bring the old team back together again.

1330
01:30:08,970 --> 01:30:12,110
So I'm working with people like Mark Healy...

1331
01:30:12,110 --> 01:30:13,090
Oh, tell me lies.

1332
01:30:13,210 --> 01:30:14,870
Tell me sweet little lies.

1333
01:30:15,950 --> 01:30:19,850
...and created Black and White Dungeon Keeper and Fable.

1334
01:30:20,830 --> 01:30:23,010
Anyway, let's have a look at Masters of Albion.

1335
01:30:23,190 --> 01:30:26,530
Alright, here's the world premiere, Masters of Albion, from Peter Molyneux.

1336
01:30:30,700 --> 01:30:32,620
This is Masters of Albion.

1337
01:30:32,860 --> 01:30:39,080
We're a team of 20 people dedicated to making something new, unique, and different.

1338
01:30:42,900 --> 01:30:44,100
Indian footage...

1339
01:30:44,100 --> 01:30:45,680
Oh yeah, it does.

1340
01:30:46,040 --> 01:30:47,860
Yeah, oh, mmm...

1341
01:30:49,180 --> 01:30:49,780
Okay...

1342
01:30:51,660 --> 01:30:52,260
Okay...

1343
01:30:57,560 --> 01:30:59,540
This is Oak Ridge.

1344
01:31:00,800 --> 01:31:01,520
Okay...

1345
01:31:03,360 --> 01:31:05,440
Gaining resources and earning money.

1346
01:31:05,880 --> 01:31:10,200
By night, your town will be attacked by many of Albion's creatures.

1347
01:31:11,340 --> 01:31:13,560
You can design anything...

1348
01:31:13,560 --> 01:31:15,980
Tap here to begin Chapter 2.

1349
01:31:16,260 --> 01:31:18,220
...where the weapons they use...

1350
01:31:18,220 --> 01:31:23,840
There is a strategy behind every creation.

1351
01:31:24,100 --> 01:31:26,460
Oh, Peter, why did you show it?

1352
01:31:26,620 --> 01:31:27,220
Oh...

1353
01:31:31,660 --> 01:31:33,320
I can help out.

1354
01:31:36,220 --> 01:31:39,280
The Sandwich Building Simulator was...

1355
01:31:39,280 --> 01:31:41,160
Oh, fucking...

1356
01:31:41,160 --> 01:31:45,860
I can also design, customize, and create all buildings.

1357
01:31:57,850 --> 01:32:00,050
It's the Colony Simulator game.

1358
01:32:00,570 --> 01:32:04,590
The sun is going down, and now my town needs defending against the horrors of Albion.

1359
01:32:04,750 --> 01:32:07,230
And this is my hero's time to shine.

1360
01:32:07,470 --> 01:32:11,700
At any point, you can possess a character.

1361
01:32:12,900 --> 01:32:13,620
Oh...

1362
01:32:14,900 --> 01:32:15,260
Okay...

1363
01:32:15,260 --> 01:32:18,160
My hero is now under my complete control.

1364
01:32:18,400 --> 01:32:20,440
And now it's time to fight.

1365
01:32:21,160 --> 01:32:21,780
Oh...

1366
01:32:24,440 --> 01:32:25,060
Oh...

1367
01:32:25,060 --> 01:32:27,960
I don't think I want to be in this mode.

1368
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:33,540
Let's switch back to god mode and unleash some real power.

1369
01:32:34,320 --> 01:32:36,940
I don't think I want to be in third-person mode.

1370
01:32:37,020 --> 01:32:38,840
That doesn't seem that fun.

1371
01:32:39,740 --> 01:32:41,600
I'm not gonna lie.

1372
01:32:41,880 --> 01:32:45,240
The third-person mode looks so fucking boring.

1373
01:32:45,240 --> 01:32:48,640
Compared to, like, god mode.

1374
01:32:48,860 --> 01:32:50,740
But bread swords just won't cut it.

1375
01:32:51,760 --> 01:32:53,000
Oh, shit.

1376
01:32:54,160 --> 01:32:57,140
This is just a glimpse of Masters of Albion.

1377
01:32:57,320 --> 01:33:02,600
An open-world god game full of combat, choices, mystery, and...

1378
01:33:02,600 --> 01:33:06,400
I guess the god simulator part seems fun.

1379
01:33:06,440 --> 01:33:07,680
But, like...

1380
01:33:08,120 --> 01:33:08,480
Oh...

1381
01:33:10,260 --> 01:33:10,980
Oh...

1382
01:33:10,980 --> 01:33:13,800
Management offers a reminder.

1383
01:33:13,980 --> 01:33:14,580
Oh.

1384
01:33:14,580 --> 01:33:16,260
What the fuck?

1385
01:33:23,910 --> 01:33:27,690
Is this why Crab Game is, like...

1386
01:33:27,690 --> 01:33:30,670
There's no resources in Crab Game now?

1387
01:33:36,340 --> 01:33:39,540
How does Crab Game graphics look better than this?

1388
01:33:43,040 --> 01:33:44,700
I don't understand.

1389
01:33:45,360 --> 01:33:47,520
Crab Game was made by two guys.

1390
01:34:05,820 --> 01:34:07,120
Oh, one game.

1391
01:34:10,510 --> 01:34:10,960
Oh.

1392
01:34:12,630 --> 01:34:13,080
Mobile.

1393
01:34:17,240 --> 01:34:19,210
Of course it is.

1394
01:34:19,330 --> 01:34:21,270
Of course it is!

1395
01:34:21,450 --> 01:34:22,910
We all have phones, guys.

1396
01:34:28,720 --> 01:34:29,800
What's this?

1397
01:34:46,600 --> 01:34:47,500
What?

1398
01:34:50,540 --> 01:34:51,180
You slept there?

1399
01:34:53,700 --> 01:34:55,160
What game is this?

1400
01:35:05,620 --> 01:35:07,340
It can't be Witcher.

1401
01:35:07,660 --> 01:35:08,220
There's guns.

1402
01:35:14,910 --> 01:35:16,610
This has to be a new IP.

1403
01:35:17,750 --> 01:35:18,390
Right?

1404
01:35:22,180 --> 01:35:22,820
Forsaken?

1405
01:35:23,080 --> 01:35:25,440
I mean, it does look, like, Forsaken a little bit.

1406
01:35:29,870 --> 01:35:31,030
My journey.

1407
01:35:31,030 --> 01:35:32,530
Oh!

1408
01:35:38,600 --> 01:35:41,120
Unknown 9 Awakening.

1409
01:35:42,340 --> 01:35:43,140
Oh!

1410
01:35:49,890 --> 01:35:51,010
Yes, really soon.

1411
01:35:51,930 --> 01:35:55,150
Is this the first time this showed up?

1412
01:35:55,330 --> 01:35:58,190
I don't think I've ever heard of it until now.

1413
01:36:02,420 --> 01:36:05,360
Wait, is this the Paedo and Tarkov?

1414
01:36:13,820 --> 01:36:15,660
You know what I thought was so funny?

1415
01:36:15,860 --> 01:36:18,120
The whole controversy with the Tarkov thing.

1416
01:36:18,640 --> 01:36:21,020
But like, they're still doing okay.

1417
01:36:24,800 --> 01:36:26,560
There's just nothing like Tarkov.

1418
01:36:35,810 --> 01:36:36,990
People can't quit.

1419
01:36:39,590 --> 01:36:41,250
We can't help them.

1420
01:36:41,870 --> 01:36:43,470
There's no saving.

1421
01:36:44,350 --> 01:36:46,050
Guys, there's no saving.

1422
01:36:46,070 --> 01:36:46,950
There's no saving Tarkov players.

1423
01:37:07,350 --> 01:37:13,010
Arena Breakout Infinite is now available in early access with the full release coming at the end of the year.

1424
01:37:13,350 --> 01:37:17,430
Now, over the years, Blizzard has been a big part of Gamescom history.

1425
01:37:17,930 --> 01:37:22,390
And this week, we are thrilled to welcome them back for the first time since 2019.

1426
01:37:24,030 --> 01:37:26,450
Here's the president of Blizzard, Johanna Fierce.

1427
01:37:26,450 --> 01:37:27,390
Wait, what?

1428
01:37:29,950 --> 01:37:31,750
Blizzard makes video games?

1429
01:37:36,210 --> 01:37:36,650
What?

1430
01:37:37,650 --> 01:37:38,570
Hello, hello, hello.

1431
01:37:38,890 --> 01:37:39,710
Hello, hello, hello.

1432
01:37:40,330 --> 01:37:41,770
Welcome to Gamescom.

1433
01:37:41,970 --> 01:37:42,670
Thank you.

1434
01:37:42,710 --> 01:37:45,490
Thank you so much for having us on behalf of Blizzard.

1435
01:37:45,950 --> 01:37:47,930
This is such a massive moment.

1436
01:37:48,090 --> 01:37:51,130
But it's such a special time to be sharing it here with everyone at Gamescom.

1437
01:37:51,390 --> 01:37:53,190
And we're just really honored to be here.

1438
01:37:53,410 --> 01:37:53,490
Wait, what?

1439
01:37:53,650 --> 01:37:55,970
Well, we're very glad to have you guys back.

1440
01:37:56,110 --> 01:37:58,450
And I know you got a big booth with Xbox, right?

1441
01:37:58,610 --> 01:37:58,950
We do.

1442
01:37:59,010 --> 01:37:59,310
Yes.

1443
01:37:59,410 --> 01:38:01,730
And come on by if you're here all week long.

1444
01:38:01,730 --> 01:38:03,130
We're proud of it.

1445
01:38:03,350 --> 01:38:06,470
But it's also a particularly big moment for Warcraft.

1446
01:38:06,910 --> 01:38:12,630
We have celebrations and anniversaries galore across Hearthstone, across Rumble.

1447
01:38:12,630 --> 01:38:12,850
Jesus.

1448
01:38:13,130 --> 01:38:15,510
And of course, a very big milestone for Warcraft.

1449
01:38:15,510 --> 01:38:16,230
Twenty, thirty years.

1450
01:38:17,010 --> 01:38:17,570
Yes.

1451
01:38:17,610 --> 01:38:22,610
Speaking of World of Warcraft, the War Within, its global launch is coming up very soon this month, right?

1452
01:38:22,770 --> 01:38:23,570
Yes, it is.

1453
01:38:23,670 --> 01:38:27,410
And we're just days away from the global launch of the War Within.

1454
01:38:28,550 --> 01:38:31,010
August 26th, it's go time for that.

1455
01:38:31,070 --> 01:38:31,710
And in two days, we're going to be back.

1456
01:38:31,730 --> 01:38:34,090
In two days, we'll actually open up early access for players.

1457
01:38:34,270 --> 01:38:35,470
So we're psyched about it.

1458
01:38:35,510 --> 01:38:36,830
Come on in and join.

1459
01:38:37,230 --> 01:38:40,710
And I just want to say it's masterful work from the team.

1460
01:38:40,970 --> 01:38:43,210
The World Soul Saga opens up...

1461
01:38:43,210 --> 01:38:44,550
Are they still subscription-based?

1462
01:38:45,590 --> 01:38:51,410
...arguably some of the most ambitious we've ever seen since WoW initially released twenty years ago.

1463
01:38:51,630 --> 01:38:52,070
Damn.

1464
01:38:52,090 --> 01:38:53,610
And we can't wait to embark on it.

1465
01:38:53,650 --> 01:38:56,570
I wonder how much someone has paid for thirty years of Warcraft.

1466
01:38:56,710 --> 01:38:57,810
This month is time for that.

1467
01:38:57,930 --> 01:39:02,630
But I know this is, you said, there's so many Warcraft anniversaries, Blizzard anniversaries, Warcraft anniversaries.

1468
01:39:02,670 --> 01:39:04,390
How can players be a part of this?

1469
01:39:04,530 --> 01:39:07,090
Yeah, there's a ton of ways we're going to be able to celebrate.

1470
01:39:07,390 --> 01:39:09,490
So we definitely hope that you join us.

1471
01:39:09,710 --> 01:39:11,210
There will be in-game events...

1472
01:39:11,210 --> 01:39:13,170
Don't ask that, Toki!

1473
01:39:13,810 --> 01:39:16,330
I'm just like thinking, like, that's a lot of years.

1474
01:39:16,670 --> 01:39:22,190
That's a lot of hours, a lot of years, a lot of expansion packs.

1475
01:39:22,390 --> 01:39:25,690
So I'm just like, like, how much did this person pay?

1476
01:39:26,310 --> 01:39:34,210
...for our very first Warcraft Direct, where the team will share more in the coming months on all the things going on for the Warcraft universe.

1477
01:39:34,710 --> 01:39:35,870
Okay, well, that's exciting.

1478
01:39:36,370 --> 01:39:41,430
Now, I was wondering about, you know, all the other Blizzard teams, are they going to get in and celebrate these anniversaries, too?

1479
01:39:41,650 --> 01:39:41,950
They are.

1480
01:39:42,130 --> 01:39:43,290
There'll be some nice surprises along the way.

1481
01:39:43,290 --> 01:39:44,290
Wait, this is it?

1482
01:39:44,370 --> 01:39:46,350
Are you just going to talk about Warcraft?

1483
01:39:48,390 --> 01:39:55,050
They've been doing some amazing work, so they're honoring a world of Warcraft and the legacy that it brings.

1484
01:39:55,410 --> 01:39:55,810
I lied.

1485
01:39:55,810 --> 01:39:57,690
There'll be a new collab in September.

1486
01:39:57,730 --> 01:39:58,650
I lied, guys.

1487
01:39:58,790 --> 01:40:01,550
They don't, they don't make games.

1488
01:40:01,590 --> 01:40:01,690
So they're honoring a world of Warcraft and the legacy that it brings.

1489
01:40:01,710 --> 01:40:02,790
This is the first new skin.

1490
01:40:03,130 --> 01:40:04,250
It's Widowmaker.

1491
01:40:04,550 --> 01:40:05,010
Yay.

1492
01:40:05,670 --> 01:40:08,030
Embracing her allegiance for the Lord.

1493
01:40:08,030 --> 01:40:09,890
They don't even have BlizzCon anymore.

1494
01:40:12,510 --> 01:40:15,350
Okay, thanks for bringing a little scoop along with you.

1495
01:40:15,490 --> 01:40:16,410
That's fantastic.

1496
01:40:16,810 --> 01:40:20,310
Now, let's move to another franchise that has a big year.

1497
01:40:20,510 --> 01:40:21,090
Diablo.

1498
01:40:21,290 --> 01:40:22,070
Oh, yes.

1499
01:40:22,130 --> 01:40:25,270
All eyes on October 8th, yes.

1500
01:40:26,250 --> 01:40:33,390
We are super excited for the Vessel of Hatred, and we're even more excited that Diablo is here at Gamescom this week.

1501
01:40:33,410 --> 01:40:36,430
We'll be the chance to have the first ever live hands-on experience.

1502
01:40:36,430 --> 01:40:37,250
Oh, there's the milking.

1503
01:40:37,710 --> 01:40:38,630
There it is.

1504
01:40:38,630 --> 01:40:39,630
Remember when I said...

1505
01:40:41,410 --> 01:40:45,130
Guys, remember when I said they haven't finished milking?

1506
01:40:45,610 --> 01:40:47,850
It's going to be a key part of what makes the Vessel of Hatred so special for us.

1507
01:40:48,070 --> 01:40:48,750
All right.

1508
01:40:48,770 --> 01:40:50,470
Well, I understand you might have brought a little something.

1509
01:40:50,470 --> 01:40:52,170
That one guy that was like, whoo!

1510
01:40:52,170 --> 01:40:52,430
We have.

1511
01:40:52,510 --> 01:40:54,510
Here's a look at our mercenary companions.

1512
01:40:55,030 --> 01:40:57,590
So take a look on behalf of the Vessel of Hatred.

1513
01:41:00,110 --> 01:41:01,130
All right, guys.

1514
01:41:01,130 --> 01:41:01,550
We're back.

1515
01:41:01,550 --> 01:41:02,550
All right.

1516
01:41:16,660 --> 01:41:18,060
We're back.

1517
01:41:18,060 --> 01:41:18,140
here.

1518
01:41:19,920 --> 01:41:24,300
For Tome of Valor.

1519
01:41:24,580 --> 01:41:24,600
Yeah!

1520
01:41:26,700 --> 01:41:29,200
All right.

1521
01:41:29,200 --> 01:41:34,180
Ready to stand and fight for those who seek us out.

1522
01:41:34,400 --> 01:41:36,400
My shield is your protection.

1523
01:41:36,920 --> 01:41:41,420
There was a time we fought the vilest of sanctuary.

1524
01:41:41,920 --> 01:41:44,940
You fools get uglier and uglier.

1525
01:41:45,500 --> 01:41:50,080
Until we were met with only our inner demons.

1526
01:41:51,100 --> 01:41:54,740
I miss when Blizzard made like cinematics.

1527
01:41:54,740 --> 01:41:58,120
Their hatred has pulled us back into the light.

1528
01:41:58,820 --> 01:41:59,540
Await

1529
01:42:05,420 --> 01:42:07,340
watching from the shadows.

1530
01:42:07,440 --> 01:42:12,920
Honestly, Blizzard could be a very good like animation company in general.

1531
01:42:13,260 --> 01:42:15,840
They just stop making games and focus on animation.

1532
01:42:16,440 --> 01:42:18,960
Their cinematics were so fucking good.

1533
01:42:26,310 --> 01:42:28,350
I've always loved their cinematics.

1534
01:42:29,610 --> 01:42:30,330
I

1535
01:42:49,560 --> 01:42:50,900
am your guardian.

1536
01:42:51,080 --> 01:42:52,520
I am your redemption.

1537
01:42:52,940 --> 01:42:54,140
I am your vengeance.

1538
01:42:54,860 --> 01:42:56,060
I am your rage.

1539
01:42:59,460 --> 01:43:01,060
That's a lot of new characters.

1540
01:43:01,320 --> 01:43:03,320
I like the little devil kid.

1541
01:43:07,740 --> 01:43:08,820
I am Batman.

1542
01:43:10,880 --> 01:43:12,960
The devil kid seems fun to play.

1543
01:43:16,780 --> 01:43:17,780
That looks great.

1544
01:43:17,820 --> 01:43:18,560
Thanks for the sneak peek.

1545
01:43:18,760 --> 01:43:25,280
Of course, and it's my esteemed pleasure to introduce Brent Gibson, game director of Diablo 4, Vessel of Hatred.

1546
01:43:27,100 --> 01:43:28,140
Hello, Gamescom!

1547
01:43:30,780 --> 01:43:32,080
The team and I are...

1548
01:43:32,080 --> 01:43:33,780
Where the fuck did I go use the bathroom?

1549
01:43:34,480 --> 01:43:36,740
The outlaw board of the first game that has something to all games.

1550
01:43:37,380 --> 01:43:38,540
An investment of hatred?

1551
01:43:38,560 --> 01:43:41,040
No, there's... it's almost too young.

1552
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:45,200
We are hard at work and have new ways to play and new ways to grow in power.

1553
01:43:45,220 --> 01:43:49,800
That looks like the Blizzard panel is where I decided to use the bathroom.

1554
01:43:50,340 --> 01:43:51,160
Oh my god.

1555
01:43:51,860 --> 01:43:53,920
The fight alongside you in your battle against hell.

1556
01:43:54,800 --> 01:43:55,920
We're also adding...

1557
01:43:55,920 --> 01:43:57,300
Oh no, I can...

1558
01:43:58,260 --> 01:43:59,380
Persevere, Doki.

1559
01:43:59,980 --> 01:44:06,000
That gives you the control on the types of challenges you're gonna see, as well as the rewards you may get.

1560
01:44:06,600 --> 01:44:09,040
And we also have the Dark Citadel.

1561
01:44:09,180 --> 01:44:11,740
Our brand new co-op...

1562
01:44:12,160 --> 01:44:12,500
Yay.

1563
01:44:13,300 --> 01:44:21,520
That challenges everything you know about combat in Diablo through a gauntlet of multiplayer puzzles and mechanics.

1564
01:44:22,500 --> 01:44:25,740
We're talking about all of it right here at Gamescom.

1565
01:44:25,740 --> 01:44:31,920
And so stay tuned if you want to see all the things that you're gonna see in Vessel of Hatred launching October 8th.

1566
01:44:31,920 --> 01:44:33,620
They're like, please don't play Path of Exile.

1567
01:44:34,040 --> 01:44:36,820
And I hope to see every single one of you on the floor all the way through the show.

1568
01:44:36,880 --> 01:44:37,740
So thank you very much.

1569
01:44:38,360 --> 01:44:39,180
See you on the floor.

1570
01:44:39,240 --> 01:44:40,480
That's why Blizzard came back.

1571
01:44:40,780 --> 01:44:44,520
Because they're like, oh no, they're announcing Path of Exile 2.

1572
01:44:45,140 --> 01:44:46,500
We gotta come back.

1573
01:44:46,940 --> 01:44:51,880
The first Berserker Kazan set for 2025 release.

1574
01:44:52,620 --> 01:44:55,420
Intense combat meets breathtaking 3D cell animation.

1575
01:44:55,420 --> 01:44:57,920
In a brutal world from Nexon.

1576
01:44:58,060 --> 01:44:59,520
Coming to PC and console.

1577
01:44:59,720 --> 01:45:02,540
Let's witness the chaos that awaits.

1578
01:45:11,140 --> 01:45:11,940
Aww.

1579
01:45:13,260 --> 01:45:15,040
There's two wolves inside me.

1580
01:45:19,270 --> 01:45:23,470
Tear into the neck of the aged lion.

1581
01:45:34,110 --> 01:45:38,110
For years, I faced unrelenting fury.

1582
01:45:39,350 --> 01:45:41,370
Made countless sacrifices.

1583
01:45:42,030 --> 01:45:42,750
What is this?

1584
01:45:44,810 --> 01:45:47,190
Does he have the two wolves inside him?

1585
01:46:20,140 --> 01:46:22,600
I like the style though.

1586
01:46:24,320 --> 01:46:26,580
The cell shading on 3D models.

1587
01:46:27,800 --> 01:46:28,960
It's pretty neat.

1588
01:46:40,960 --> 01:46:42,240
Doesn't look too bad.

1589
01:46:43,080 --> 01:46:44,800
They were saying Nexon, but like...

1590
01:46:45,860 --> 01:46:46,860
Which is the part...

1591
01:46:46,860 --> 01:46:48,880
What should I be disappointed about later?

1592
01:46:51,720 --> 01:46:52,840
It looks really good.

1593
01:46:54,640 --> 01:46:59,760
Our alliance has been formed.

1594
01:47:01,520 --> 01:47:02,900
The first Berserker.

1595
01:47:06,390 --> 01:47:09,950
I fell for this trap so many times.

1596
01:47:11,970 --> 01:47:13,350
Oh, is this...

1597
01:47:13,350 --> 01:47:14,470
Is this...

1598
01:47:14,470 --> 01:47:16,010
Is this what I have to do?

1599
01:47:16,010 --> 01:47:16,250
The fact is I was like no.

1600
01:47:16,430 --> 01:47:18,130
Don't fall for it.

1601
01:47:19,010 --> 01:47:19,590
You didn't know what it was that it always wanted.

1602
01:47:23,780 --> 01:47:27,240
You're choices will remake the world.

1603
01:47:27,800 --> 01:47:30,920
And every turn becomes an opportunity.

1604
01:47:31,040 --> 01:47:31,940
Not gonna lie.

1605
01:47:32,320 --> 01:47:35,420
Those backgrounds look so AI generated.

1606
01:47:35,840 --> 01:47:37,020
So I hope it's not.

1607
01:47:39,380 --> 01:47:41,040
Like the tears in the back.

1608
01:47:45,160 --> 01:47:46,680
Like the tears in the back.

1609
01:47:46,680 --> 01:47:46,960
Alright!

1610
01:47:47,480 --> 01:47:51,680
I was like, he looks so AI-generated when they're sitting on those chairs.

1611
01:47:56,900 --> 01:47:57,620
What

1612
01:48:01,580 --> 01:48:02,960
the fuck is this?

1613
01:48:03,700 --> 01:48:04,420
Dog!

1614
01:48:07,540 --> 01:48:11,940
Oh, Darken Darker!

1615
01:48:18,550 --> 01:48:19,390
Oh shit!

1616
01:48:59,180 --> 01:49:00,180
Oh, mobile!

1617
01:49:04,400 --> 01:49:04,940
Oh...

1618
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:13,200
Darken Darker mobile is now available for global pre-registration.

1619
01:49:13,580 --> 01:49:23,940
Now from NetEase Games, this next trailer is a new life simulation game where players can travel among super-powered worlds to craft their island and engage with friends.

1620
01:49:24,160 --> 01:49:27,800
I feel like that has been the most budget they've ever spent on a trailer.

1621
01:49:29,140 --> 01:49:30,620
For Darken Darker.

1622
01:49:30,760 --> 01:49:32,120
Because I was so confused.

1623
01:49:32,180 --> 01:49:33,120
I was like, wow.

1624
01:49:35,640 --> 01:49:36,540
What's this?

1625
01:49:38,940 --> 01:49:39,680
Awww.

1626
01:49:43,150 --> 01:49:46,390
Is this like Animal Crossing?

1627
01:49:46,710 --> 01:49:47,450
Awww!

1628
01:49:47,590 --> 01:49:48,870
Look at those little birds!

1629
01:49:50,330 --> 01:49:52,250
They're wearing little outfits!

1630
01:49:52,650 --> 01:49:53,410
Oh shit!

1631
01:49:54,870 --> 01:49:56,270
Changed the weather.

1632
01:49:56,490 --> 01:49:58,170
Yeah, who the fuck wants a thunderstorm?

1633
01:49:59,190 --> 01:50:00,630
That's so cute!

1634
01:50:02,810 --> 01:50:05,250
Oh, it's a farm game.

1635
01:50:05,350 --> 01:50:06,030
It's a farm game.

1636
01:50:09,130 --> 01:50:10,910
Oh, no, there's terraforming.

1637
01:50:12,010 --> 01:50:14,150
Oh god, I can't do that.

1638
01:50:14,350 --> 01:50:15,450
Just give me...

1639
01:50:16,030 --> 01:50:18,150
I can't terraform for shit.

1640
01:50:26,950 --> 01:50:31,170
You know like when Animal Crossing gave me the option to terraform, I stopped playing the game.

1641
01:50:33,550 --> 01:50:35,390
I was like, I can't.

1642
01:50:35,390 --> 01:50:36,730
I don't know what I'm doing.

1643
01:50:36,870 --> 01:50:38,530
I don't know what I'm doing.

1644
01:50:38,530 --> 01:50:39,010
I don't know what I'm doing.

1645
01:50:41,770 --> 01:50:45,390
I felt way too overwhelmed after that.

1646
01:50:48,490 --> 01:50:49,490
Oh shit.

1647
01:50:49,650 --> 01:50:51,210
The autumn and snow globes?

1648
01:50:51,370 --> 01:50:51,910
It's cute.

1649
01:50:54,850 --> 01:50:55,450
Coming.

1650
01:50:56,010 --> 01:50:57,770
More imagination sores.

1651
01:50:58,110 --> 01:50:59,350
Does anyone remember?

1652
01:50:59,610 --> 01:51:00,730
You know the style remember?

1653
01:51:00,870 --> 01:51:04,270
Remember that game about like the children with like...

1654
01:51:04,270 --> 01:51:04,790
It was like...

1655
01:51:04,790 --> 01:51:06,970
Looked like Splatoon, but like not really.

1656
01:51:07,330 --> 01:51:08,850
Indiana Jones and the Great Circle!

1657
01:51:08,970 --> 01:51:08,990
Indiana Jones and the Great Circle!

1658
01:51:08,990 --> 01:51:09,390
Oh!

1659
01:51:10,230 --> 01:51:11,490
I'm looking for this game.

1660
01:51:12,590 --> 01:51:13,470
It was like...

1661
01:51:13,470 --> 01:51:17,990
It was like these children with like Pokemon and stuff, but also Splatoon.

1662
01:51:19,210 --> 01:51:20,870
I can't remember what it was called.

1663
01:51:21,730 --> 01:51:22,290
Does it exist?

1664
01:51:22,890 --> 01:51:26,190
It had a really cute trailer, and then nothing ever came out of it.

1665
01:51:26,490 --> 01:51:27,090
It's up to you to uncover.

1666
01:51:27,830 --> 01:51:29,730
No, it's not the foam one.

1667
01:51:30,650 --> 01:51:32,750
They were like on skateboards and stuff.

1668
01:51:32,930 --> 01:51:33,990
Oh, Troy Baker!

1669
01:51:34,410 --> 01:51:38,530
It's humbling playing a character that so many people, myself included, look up to.

1670
01:51:38,990 --> 01:51:44,230
As a kid, seeing Indiana Jones in the theater for the first time was a defining moment for me.

1671
01:51:44,470 --> 01:51:49,310
And I never would have guessed that all these years later I would be the one wearing the hat.

1672
01:51:49,670 --> 01:51:50,550
But here I am.

1673
01:51:50,770 --> 01:51:52,150
It's been a dream come true.

1674
01:51:53,010 --> 01:51:56,710
A dream that I cannot wait for you to live for yourself.

1675
01:51:58,570 --> 01:52:04,090
The beauty of a first person game like this is that we all get to feel what it's like to become Indy.

1676
01:52:04,230 --> 01:52:05,870
You are the one who cracks the wind.

1677
01:52:05,870 --> 01:52:08,110
Who feels the weight of every punch.

1678
01:52:08,210 --> 01:52:10,170
And the thrill of finding every clue.

1679
01:52:10,750 --> 01:52:12,470
Indy is such a unique character.

1680
01:52:13,270 --> 01:52:13,870
Professor.

1681
01:52:14,690 --> 01:52:15,890
An archaeologist.

1682
01:52:16,170 --> 01:52:17,270
A brawler.

1683
01:52:17,390 --> 01:52:18,370
An explorer.

1684
01:52:18,730 --> 01:52:21,870
Too bad he became poor when he got older.

1685
01:52:22,150 --> 01:52:25,290
This game has everything you'd expect from an Indiana Jones adventure.

1686
01:52:26,230 --> 01:52:27,130
Mysterious artifacts.

1687
01:52:28,070 --> 01:52:29,050
Cunning villains.

1688
01:52:29,530 --> 01:52:30,670
Ancient discoveries.

1689
01:52:31,230 --> 01:52:32,430
Hard hitting action.

1690
01:52:32,430 --> 01:52:37,290
It's a world of constant danger where you've got to think on your feet to stay alive.

1691
01:52:37,750 --> 01:52:40,370
The great circle spans the entire globe.

1692
01:52:40,530 --> 01:52:44,350
From snake filled jungle temples to scorpion riddled desert tombs.

1693
01:52:44,490 --> 01:52:47,490
Stunning open areas to explore freely.

1694
01:52:47,590 --> 01:52:49,570
Full of secrets for you to discover.

1695
01:52:49,830 --> 01:52:52,790
And you'll get more than just the classic whip and revolver.

1696
01:52:52,910 --> 01:53:04,210
Indy's journal and his camera will immerse you in the mystery providing extra info on all of your finds so you can appreciate all of the little historical details he obsesses over.

1697
01:53:04,390 --> 01:53:09,710
And those details are your key to solving the ancient puzzles that hold the secrets you're after.

1698
01:53:10,210 --> 01:53:11,950
But ancient secrets don't come easy.

1699
01:53:12,170 --> 01:53:13,670
It's best to have an exit strategy.

1700
01:53:14,630 --> 01:53:19,190
This is an incredible new way to experience Indiana Jones and I can't wait for you to play.

1701
01:53:25,710 --> 01:53:27,010
When's this game coming out?

1702
01:53:27,130 --> 01:53:28,270
I'm looking forward to playing this one.

1703
01:53:30,210 --> 01:53:31,410
Doesn't that look great?

1704
01:53:32,430 --> 01:53:33,150
Yeah, it looks fun.

1705
01:53:34,130 --> 01:53:37,410
But you're probably wondering when the game comes out, right?

1706
01:53:38,110 --> 01:53:38,450
Yeah!

1707
01:53:38,510 --> 01:53:39,550
Yeah, Jeff!

1708
01:53:43,350 --> 01:53:44,030
December!

1709
01:53:45,170 --> 01:53:46,930
Wait, that's so soon!

1710
01:53:48,210 --> 01:53:48,890
Nice!

1711
01:53:51,550 --> 01:53:57,510
Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is coming out this December for Xbox Game Pass and PC.

1712
01:53:58,410 --> 01:54:06,210
But there is one more thing that MachineGames and Bethesda wanted to share with you about Indiana Jones and the Great Circle.

1713
01:54:06,350 --> 01:54:07,510
Wait, it's made by Bethesda?

1714
01:54:15,090 --> 01:54:16,910
Oh, for PS5!

1715
01:54:19,530 --> 01:54:26,550
Alright, before we wrap up O&L we do have one final game announcement for you.

1716
01:54:26,630 --> 01:54:27,610
Check this out!

1717
01:54:30,190 --> 01:54:30,710
Oh!

1718
01:54:30,850 --> 01:54:31,650
Last one!

1719
01:54:37,990 --> 01:54:39,110
Assassin's Creed?

1720
01:54:43,630 --> 01:54:44,190
Silksong?

1721
01:54:46,610 --> 01:54:47,550
Oh my god!

1722
01:54:47,590 --> 01:54:48,890
That's why it took so long!

1723
01:54:49,030 --> 01:54:50,570
They had to change the graphics!

1724
01:54:51,370 --> 01:54:52,470
Oh my god!

1725
01:54:52,510 --> 01:54:54,050
They gave the bug a knife!

1726
01:54:57,270 --> 01:54:59,350
That has to be Assassin's Creed, right?

1727
01:54:59,350 --> 01:55:01,070
Because they are saying the brotherhood.

1728
01:55:02,350 --> 01:55:03,450
Oh my god!

1729
01:55:03,510 --> 01:55:04,090
Kingdom Hearts!

1730
01:55:04,390 --> 01:55:05,790
Sora went to Italy!

1731
01:55:11,640 --> 01:55:12,400
Mafia?

1732
01:55:12,880 --> 01:55:13,640
MAFIA?!

1733
01:55:16,200 --> 01:55:17,520
Oh shit!

1734
01:55:20,300 --> 01:55:21,060
Mafia?!

1735
01:55:21,060 --> 01:55:23,380
A new Mafia game?!

1736
01:55:23,380 --> 01:55:24,780
A new Mafia game?!

1737
01:55:24,780 --> 01:55:25,700
Oh my god!

1738
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:28,780
Sora is going to Italy!

1739
01:55:28,780 --> 01:55:29,600
Hahaha!

1740
01:55:31,540 --> 01:55:31,980
Oh!

1741
01:55:33,160 --> 01:55:36,000
We are going back to the roots of what fans love about the Mafia franchise.

1742
01:55:36,260 --> 01:55:37,120
Please be good.

1743
01:55:37,180 --> 01:55:37,860
Please be good.

1744
01:55:38,040 --> 01:55:39,760
I fucking love Mafia!

1745
01:55:40,520 --> 01:55:43,320
Mafia's success is built on our players' passion for the franchise.

1746
01:55:43,640 --> 01:55:46,800
And we are so proud to return to Mafia with the old country.

1747
01:55:46,980 --> 01:55:48,480
We can't wait to show you all more.

1748
01:55:48,800 --> 01:55:49,640
Thanks for watching.

1749
01:55:51,580 --> 01:55:52,900
Okay, that was a good...

1750
01:55:52,900 --> 01:55:53,480
That was good.

1751
01:55:55,220 --> 01:55:56,980
That was a fun surprise, right?

1752
01:55:56,980 --> 01:55:59,180
Alright, well that is a wrap.

1753
01:55:59,420 --> 01:56:01,580
I mean, at least it ended on Mafia.

1754
01:56:02,120 --> 01:56:10,120
We hope to see you again this December, December 12th when the Game Awards streams live everywhere for our 10th anniversary show.

1755
01:56:10,340 --> 01:56:12,080
Oh my god, December...

1756
01:56:12,080 --> 01:56:15,240
The Game Awards 10 year anniversary!

1757
01:56:15,880 --> 01:56:17,760
That's a really good 10 years!

1758
01:56:18,680 --> 01:56:21,160
Alright, well thanks again to my co-host Shox.

1759
01:56:21,640 --> 01:56:22,840
Didn't she do a great job?

1760
01:56:23,200 --> 01:56:23,480
Yeah!

1761
01:56:23,940 --> 01:56:25,300
Thank you so much, Jeff.

1762
01:56:25,320 --> 01:56:26,540
It was really great to be here.

1763
01:56:26,980 --> 01:56:28,400
I hope everyone had an amazing time.

1764
01:56:28,620 --> 01:56:30,460
Can I say something in German, too?

1765
01:56:30,700 --> 01:56:32,600
I don't want to show you up, but...

1766
01:56:32,600 --> 01:56:33,920
Vielen Dank, ihr Lieben.

1767
01:56:33,940 --> 01:56:35,500
Ich hoffe, ihr hattet eine super, super Zeit.

1768
01:56:35,560 --> 01:56:37,040
Und viel Spaß auf der Gamescom.

1769
01:56:38,260 --> 01:56:40,260
Well done, German, as opposed to mine.

1770
01:56:40,300 --> 01:56:40,760
I'm learning.

1771
01:56:40,900 --> 01:56:42,380
Alright, thanks so much, Shox.

1772
01:56:42,440 --> 01:56:42,980
Thanks to everyone.

1773
01:56:43,060 --> 01:56:43,920
Enjoy Gamescom.

1774
01:56:44,160 --> 01:56:45,000
Have a great night.

1775
01:56:45,060 --> 01:56:46,560
How is he still learning German?

1776
01:56:52,260 --> 01:56:52,940
He's convinced.

1777
01:56:53,840 --> 01:56:55,020
He's still learning.

1778
01:56:56,980 --> 01:56:57,220
Hahaha!

1779
01:56:58,880 --> 01:56:59,600
Hahaha!

1780
01:57:02,760 --> 01:57:03,480
Hahaha!

1781
01:57:03,480 --> 01:57:05,160
Come on, Jeff!

1782
01:57:05,660 --> 01:57:06,240
Hahaha!

1783
01:57:06,940 --> 01:57:07,100
Hahaha!

1784
01:57:08,660 --> 01:57:10,520
See you next year!

1785
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:11,700
Alright.

1786
01:57:12,960 --> 01:57:16,980
Honest opinion on it so far, on Gamescom.

1787
01:57:17,240 --> 01:57:28,320
I will rate the trailers that we saw overall, I will rate that as like I think like 6 or 5 out of 10.

1788
01:57:28,720 --> 01:57:32,300
There was not really a lot of good games to look forward to.

1789
01:57:32,820 --> 01:57:33,440
Mafia?

1790
01:57:33,480 --> 01:57:34,440
Yeah, Mafia.

1791
01:57:34,500 --> 01:57:36,340
I was like super hyped for Mafia.

1792
01:57:37,020 --> 01:57:39,780
The RC car in Call of Duty 6.

1793
01:57:40,720 --> 01:57:41,340
Hahaha!

1794
01:57:44,760 --> 01:57:47,880
The RC car in Call of Duty 6.

1795
01:57:48,200 --> 01:57:49,340
The RC car in Call of Duty 6.

1796
01:57:49,340 --> 01:57:49,480
The RC car in Call of Duty 6.

1797
01:57:49,480 --> 01:57:50,080
Mafia.

1798
01:57:52,040 --> 01:57:52,480
Um...

1799
01:57:54,320 --> 01:57:56,560
I sort of forgot all the other trailers.

1800
01:57:56,720 --> 01:57:58,000
They were all very forget...

1801
01:57:58,000 --> 01:57:58,400
Hahaha!

1802
01:57:58,700 --> 01:57:59,920
They were all very...

1803
01:57:59,920 --> 01:58:00,540
I don't know.

1804
01:58:00,760 --> 01:58:03,720
They were all very like...

1805
01:58:04,240 --> 01:58:08,020
Like Space Marine, the thing is we knew about Space Marine for a long time.

1806
01:58:08,100 --> 01:58:12,400
They've been releasing trailers for Space Marine for fucking 2 years now.

1807
01:58:12,600 --> 01:58:14,040
So like it's not like...

1808
01:58:14,040 --> 01:58:15,300
I don't see that as a new thing.

1809
01:58:15,660 --> 01:58:17,480
I'm talking about like the new releases.

1810
01:58:17,480 --> 01:58:19,420
Not like the um...

1811
01:58:19,420 --> 01:58:20,900
I'm talking about the...

1812
01:58:20,900 --> 01:58:21,800
The TV show!

1813
01:58:21,980 --> 01:58:24,820
Yes, the TV show seemed really fucking hyped though.

1814
01:58:24,940 --> 01:58:26,560
That seemed really good.

1815
01:58:26,960 --> 01:58:29,520
I think my favorite part is that I was like Spelunky.

1816
01:58:30,320 --> 01:58:30,840
Hahaha!

1817
01:58:31,700 --> 01:58:31,700
Hahaha!

1818
01:58:32,040 --> 01:58:33,700
So I was like Oh my god.

1819
01:58:34,340 --> 01:58:35,420
Spelunky got in.

1820
01:58:35,520 --> 01:58:40,880
I was so surprised that Spelunky is getting like an episode in the um...

1821
01:58:40,880 --> 01:58:41,840
In the TV show.

1822
01:58:42,160 --> 01:58:43,620
But other than that I don't know.

1823
01:58:43,700 --> 01:58:44,840
What are you guys excited about?

1824
01:58:45,080 --> 01:58:46,740
For me it was like... I don't know.

1825
01:58:47,480 --> 01:58:50,580
I was just like... I was just like looking through it and I was like...

1826
01:58:50,580 --> 01:58:56,500
The most memorable parts for the newer games was definitely like Mafia.

1827
01:58:56,760 --> 01:58:58,280
And uh...

1828
01:58:58,880 --> 01:59:01,300
Mafia and RC car.

1829
01:59:01,620 --> 01:59:02,360
Indiana Jones?

1830
01:59:02,540 --> 01:59:02,780
Yeah.

1831
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:04,400
But like Indiana Jones...

1832
01:59:04,400 --> 01:59:07,340
The fact that we got a release date now...

1833
01:59:07,340 --> 01:59:09,700
I feel like December a lot of cool games...

1834
01:59:09,700 --> 01:59:11,400
Like the next couple of months...

1835
01:59:11,400 --> 01:59:15,160
The next couple of months a lot of like very cool games are coming out.

1836
01:59:15,660 --> 01:59:16,840
Um... very soon.

1837
01:59:17,480 --> 01:59:18,160
Um... Oh!

1838
01:59:18,260 --> 01:59:18,880
The...

1839
01:59:18,880 --> 01:59:19,920
Was it the Niki?

1840
01:59:20,200 --> 01:59:21,700
The Niki one was really cute.

1841
01:59:21,900 --> 01:59:23,340
I hope it actually...

1842
01:59:23,340 --> 01:59:24,980
I hope it's actually good.

1843
01:59:25,420 --> 01:59:27,900
Cause that game looks really really cute.

1844
01:59:28,100 --> 01:59:29,120
It looks like the...

1845
01:59:29,120 --> 01:59:31,240
The um...

1846
01:59:31,240 --> 01:59:34,100
It looks like their own take on like Pokemon.

1847
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:35,640
Um...

1848
01:59:35,640 --> 01:59:37,780
I'm trying to like... There was like...

1849
01:59:37,780 --> 01:59:39,260
There's this game...

1850
01:59:39,260 --> 01:59:42,060
There's this game that like...

1851
01:59:43,440 --> 01:59:44,500
It was...

1852
01:59:44,500 --> 01:59:49,080
It was... It like reminded me when we saw the Skyworld or whatever.

1853
01:59:49,320 --> 01:59:50,420
The Sky game.

1854
01:59:50,560 --> 01:59:59,180
It reminded me of like this game... This trailer that showed up regarding like these... Like a bunch of children with like Pokemon and stuff.

1855
01:59:59,540 --> 02:00:03,480
Like it was like also sort of like Pokemon and they were like skateboarding and everything.

1856
02:00:03,680 --> 02:00:04,620
And I'm like...

1857
02:00:04,620 --> 02:00:06,220
I... Was it Doki V?

1858
02:00:07,700 --> 02:00:08,560
Was it that?

1859
02:00:08,620 --> 02:00:08,840
Yeah!

1860
02:00:09,040 --> 02:00:09,840
It was that!

1861
02:00:10,540 --> 02:00:12,500
What the fuck happened to this game?

1862
02:00:13,200 --> 02:00:14,400
I was...

1863
02:00:14,500 --> 02:00:16,700
What happened to this game?

1864
02:00:16,920 --> 02:00:18,000
It looked cool!

1865
02:00:18,320 --> 02:00:20,980
I heard nothing after that.

1866
02:00:21,260 --> 02:00:22,400
Like I thought...

1867
02:00:22,400 --> 02:00:23,900
It like reminded me of that.

1868
02:00:24,080 --> 02:00:24,700
And like...

1869
02:00:24,700 --> 02:00:26,920
I heard nothing about it after that.

1870
02:00:27,180 --> 02:00:27,940
It's been...

1871
02:00:28,520 --> 02:00:29,580
It's been a while.

1872
02:00:29,880 --> 02:00:31,460
I'm fucking gonna read this up.

1873
02:00:31,580 --> 02:00:32,380
Like what hap... Yeah!

1874
02:00:32,400 --> 02:00:33,060
What happened?

1875
02:00:33,420 --> 02:00:35,480
What happened to Doki V?

1876
02:00:36,400 --> 02:00:36,960
Like...

1877
02:00:38,580 --> 02:00:41,040
It was set to launch at 20... Guys!

1878
02:00:41,100 --> 02:00:43,040
This game was set to launch at 2024.

1879
02:00:43,840 --> 02:00:44,400
Like...

1880
02:00:44,500 --> 02:00:45,540
What happened to it?

1881
02:00:45,720 --> 02:00:45,960
Okay.

1882
02:00:46,080 --> 02:00:47,360
The official Twitter.

1883
02:00:47,680 --> 02:00:52,560
Cause I was like thinking about it when we were looking at that... The Niki and the Skytrailer.

1884
02:00:52,760 --> 02:00:55,480
The last tweet they did was 2022.

1885
02:00:55,660 --> 02:00:56,220
Oh god.

1886
02:00:56,300 --> 02:00:56,860
This game's dead.

1887
02:00:59,220 --> 02:01:00,340
That was...

1888
02:01:00,340 --> 02:01:02,240
That was... That's the...

1889
02:01:02,240 --> 02:01:03,220
Oh my god.

1890
02:01:03,340 --> 02:01:04,900
And the last...

1891
02:01:04,900 --> 02:01:07,220
The last update was 2022.

1892
02:01:07,540 --> 02:01:09,640
I was actually lowkey hyped for it.

1893
02:01:09,700 --> 02:01:10,460
It looked really cute.

1894
02:01:12,200 --> 02:01:12,760
Um...

1895
02:01:12,760 --> 02:01:13,780
It looked really cute.

1896
02:01:13,920 --> 02:01:14,480
Um...

1897
02:01:14,500 --> 02:01:15,020
But yeah!

1898
02:01:15,220 --> 02:01:16,320
Honestly like...

1899
02:01:16,320 --> 02:01:16,720
I don't know.

1900
02:01:17,040 --> 02:01:22,160
There wasn't really a lot to be excited about for this year.

1901
02:01:22,220 --> 02:01:24,200
This year's Gamescom.

1902
02:01:24,580 --> 02:01:27,520
Um... Maybe the Game Awards will have more hype news.

1903
02:01:27,600 --> 02:01:29,200
I don't know if it's because I'm getting older.

1904
02:01:29,980 --> 02:01:30,560
Uh...

1905
02:01:30,560 --> 02:01:32,400
Or like... Or I'm just...

1906
02:01:32,400 --> 02:01:35,800
I'm getting more pessimistic about game releases and stuff.

1907
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:40,510
But I feel like... I feel like that... That one was like...

1908
02:01:41,060 --> 02:01:43,980
There was not a lot of new announcements.

1909
02:01:44,480 --> 02:01:44,800
Yeah.

1910
02:01:45,100 --> 02:01:46,120
It was just...

1911
02:01:46,120 --> 02:01:47,500
I was just like...

1912
02:01:47,500 --> 02:01:50,440
I feel like there wasn't a lot of new announcements.

1913
02:01:50,600 --> 02:01:56,680
It was just rehashing the same... The same trailers over... Like the same trailers we saw before.

1914
02:01:57,440 --> 02:01:58,040
And...

1915
02:01:58,040 --> 02:02:02,860
There was not a lot of like... It was all like known stuff that we knew was gonna come out.

1916
02:02:03,100 --> 02:02:05,620
And there wasn't really like premieres or anything.

1917
02:02:06,380 --> 02:02:08,740
Um... Not even for indie games too.

1918
02:02:09,260 --> 02:02:09,860
Uh...

1919
02:02:09,860 --> 02:02:12,660
So I was like not as hooked as I was.

1920
02:02:12,880 --> 02:02:17,160
Like I feel like Summer Game Fest had a lot more cooler stuff releasing.

1921
02:02:18,320 --> 02:02:18,760
Um...

1922
02:02:20,700 --> 02:02:21,140
Um...

1923
02:02:21,680 --> 02:02:22,420
And... Yeah.

1924
02:02:22,580 --> 02:02:26,960
But maybe the Game Awards will have... Maybe there's just too many fucking... You know what?

1925
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:27,600
I know why.

1926
02:02:27,740 --> 02:02:31,920
There's too many fucking... There's too many like... Jeff, you made too many.

1927
02:02:32,020 --> 02:02:33,040
We just need two.

1928
02:02:33,180 --> 02:02:35,700
We don't need like one in the summer and one in the...

1929
02:02:35,700 --> 02:02:38,300
Like maybe like one in the summer and one in the winter.

1930
02:02:38,480 --> 02:02:39,840
He just made too many.

1931
02:02:39,860 --> 02:02:40,480
shows.

1932
02:02:40,720 --> 02:02:41,960
There's like...

1933
02:02:43,840 --> 02:02:46,120
Like there's too many shows.

1934
02:02:46,780 --> 02:02:50,900
And it was not as hyped anymore because there's not enough games.

1935
02:02:52,620 --> 02:02:56,080
There's not enough games to like fucking fill it up.

1936
02:02:56,400 --> 02:03:01,300
They're literally reusing the same fucking games and just use new trailers.

1937
02:03:01,440 --> 02:03:03,060
But it's like I know it's coming out.

1938
02:03:03,240 --> 02:03:03,600
Like...

1939
02:03:03,600 --> 02:03:05,040
Or like it's already out.

1940
02:03:05,180 --> 02:03:07,660
So it's like I don't have like much expectations on it.

1941
02:03:07,800 --> 02:03:08,080
Like...

1942
02:03:11,180 --> 02:03:13,080
We literally just need two.

1943
02:03:13,400 --> 02:03:15,600
Like summer and winter.

1944
02:03:15,660 --> 02:03:17,580
We don't need fucking five.

1945
02:03:17,980 --> 02:03:19,600
Like... It's five, right?

1946
02:03:19,720 --> 02:03:26,060
We have Summer Game Fest, Gamescom, the Game Awards, and like... I know there's like one more.

1947
02:03:26,220 --> 02:03:27,200
I forgot what it's called.

1948
02:03:27,320 --> 02:03:28,160
There's like one more.

1949
02:03:28,440 --> 02:03:29,640
There's just way too many.

1950
02:03:36,280 --> 02:03:36,840
Anyway...

1951
02:03:38,480 --> 02:03:39,040
Uh...

1952
02:03:40,160 --> 02:03:40,940
Oh yeah!

1953
02:03:41,020 --> 02:03:42,860
And then there's the Tokyo Game Show.

1954
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:44,340
But that's not run by Jeff though.

1955
02:03:45,120 --> 02:03:46,800
Um... That's not run by Jeff.

1956
02:03:47,020 --> 02:03:47,620
But yeah!

1957
02:03:47,800 --> 02:03:48,360
Anyway...

1958
02:03:48,360 --> 02:03:52,220
I do have a nice stream later today at 5pm.

1959
02:03:52,860 --> 02:03:53,980
Um... So...

1960
02:03:53,980 --> 02:03:56,680
We're checking out the new Overwatch updates.

1961
02:03:56,840 --> 02:03:58,400
Right after I was like...

1962
02:03:58,400 --> 02:04:01,800
I was just like, you know...

1963
02:04:01,800 --> 02:04:08,660
I was just disappointed because Jeff was like, oh Blizzard hasn't been here since 2019.

1964
02:04:08,900 --> 02:04:10,420
And I was like, oh my god!

1965
02:04:10,440 --> 02:04:11,940
Are they gonna actually announce something new?

1966
02:04:12,300 --> 02:04:14,460
Do they actually make video games again?

1967
02:04:14,780 --> 02:04:16,800
And then it was just like...

1968
02:04:17,780 --> 02:04:19,240
Just an expansion pack.

1969
02:04:19,440 --> 02:04:20,360
And I was just like...

1970
02:04:20,360 --> 02:04:28,980
I honestly... I honestly thought they were gonna announce something new.

1971
02:04:29,220 --> 02:04:31,280
Cause like... Why did he hype it up?

1972
02:04:31,680 --> 02:04:32,860
Why was he like...

1973
02:04:32,860 --> 02:04:34,480
They haven't been here since 2019!

1974
02:04:35,200 --> 02:04:36,060
I was like... Oh?

1975
02:04:36,840 --> 02:04:37,940
Oh my god!

1976
02:04:38,020 --> 02:04:39,380
That has to be super hyped!

1977
02:04:39,700 --> 02:04:43,020
And then it was just... Here's some expansion packs.

1978
02:04:43,300 --> 02:04:44,000
And I'm like...

1979
02:04:45,320 --> 02:04:45,960
Okay...

1980
02:04:49,720 --> 02:04:50,860

1982
02:04:53,300 --> 02:04:54,200

02:04:54,200 --> 02:04:55,980

1984
02:04:56,880 --> 02:04:57,520

My name is Doki Bird and...

1996
02:05:18,680 --> 02:05:21,040
Um... I usually stream on YouTube!

1997
02:05:21,200 --> 02:05:26,800
But today I am on Twitch because I'm doing a watch along and I like to do watch alongs where I can stream the watch along itself.

1998
02:05:27,120 --> 02:05:29,020
The stream feed on Twitch.

1999
02:05:29,260 --> 02:05:32,040
So usually I do most of my watch alongs on Twitch cause it's just easier.

2000
02:05:33,380 --> 02:05:35,740
So please check me out on YouTube.

2001
02:05:35,980 --> 02:05:39,640
Uh... Usually I tweet out when I'm streaming on Twitch so please follow me on Twitter.

2002
02:05:39,920 --> 02:05:42,960
Um... If you want to support me via other means, please uh...

2003
02:05:42,960 --> 02:05:44,220
Uh... Check out my merch.

2004

2007
02:05:48,540 --> 02:05:52,860
As always everyone, stay hydrated, posture check, get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

2008
02:05:52,960 --> 02:05:54,800
And if you stood up for me, head to bed!

2009
02:05:54,980 --> 02:05:56,380
