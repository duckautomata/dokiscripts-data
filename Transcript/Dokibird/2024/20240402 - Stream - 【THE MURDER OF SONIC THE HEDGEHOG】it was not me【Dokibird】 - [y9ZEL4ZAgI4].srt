00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,800
Hello, everybody.

2
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:53,580
April Fool's.

3
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,340
The screen.

4
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,220
We're so back.

5
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:01,010
Hello.

6
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:03,370
Today, I'm a little naked today.

7
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:05,290
What is this knife I'm holding?

8
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:06,530
I'm making a salad.

9
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:10,650
What do you mean?

10
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:13,110
I'm my true form.

11
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,010
Also, my brain today.

12
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:17,050
I just need you guys to know.

13
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:18,930
I had four hours.

14
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:19,550
of sleep.

15
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:22,010
Maybe.

16
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:25,710
My brain's a little bit more enhanced than usual.

17
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:34,190
I might be a little more stupid than usual because, like, I
had, like, three to four hours of sleep today because I was

18
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:34,870
working.

19
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:38,170
I spent my entire night.

20
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:41,850
I went to bed at, like, 9 a.m.

21
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:42,370
today.

22
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:44,090
And then, yes, today.

23
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:45,850
I went to bed at 9 a.m.

24
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:46,290
today.

25
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:52,390
And then, like, I woke up at What time did I woke up?

26
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:53,030
12?

27
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:55,290
At like 12 or 1?

28
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:00,430
So my brain is not okay.

29
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:01,730
But that's fine.

30
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:04,630
Today's the best day to not be okay.

31
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:06,550
It's April Fool's.

32
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:12,030
If I do something fucked up, I can be like, Ha ha, April
Fool's.

33
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:13,010
That's not me.

34
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:15,450
That's not my intrusive thoughts thinking.

35
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:17,250
I'm just joking with you guys.

36
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:18,850
April Fool's.

37
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:31,090
You'll never know what is right or wrong So yes, my brain
currently Might need a little bit more oxygen today But I

38
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:39,150
sort of like fucked up with that So right now I'm actually
on a stream of consciousness Or I don't even thinking about

39
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:50,770
what I'm saying And oh god, this is not a good idea Usually
I have I know it's really fucking wild this little filter on

40
00:05:50,770 --> 00:06:00,390
like a little you know a little like you know don't be a
brand risk filter you know like you're you're a you're

41
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:16,270
you're an internet personality now dokey don't say anything
that you will regret but today today is a little risky when

42
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:25,250
there's not enough oxygen going to my brain It is um, it is
a little risky right now for me to stream because I only I

43
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:28,910
did not have a lot of sleep So we'll see how this goes.

44
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:32,050
We're gonna see how this goes, but it's okay.

45
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:33,130
It's okay.

46
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:34,250
Where are you gonna do?

47
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:35,270
What are you gonna do?

48
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:36,410
Cancel a tomato?

49
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:38,730
I'm a fucking fruit.

50
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:40,570
You can't do that to me.

51
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:43,210
Anyway, yes, happy April Fool's everybody.

52
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:44,590
I hope you guys

53
00:06:48,950 --> 00:07:00,710
you guys enjoyed uh welcoming back our intro it was it's
finally here i know like april i could have just played the

54
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:06,890
intro for an hour straight but i sort of actually really
wanted to play the murder of sonic the hedgehog it's been

55
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:14,070
like a game that i wanted to play since last year so like i
was like you know what i was so i was so sad i was actually

56
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:24,950
waiting to like you know because like Japan is really really
good with like April Fool's and So I was like oh wait cuz

57
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:31,630
like they released cuz you know Japan really goes like all
out when it comes to like April Fool's pranks for some

58
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:39,150
reason I don't know why I don't know why but like it's
always Japan that does like like pull all stops and does

59
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:47,150
like a hundred percent On April Fool's jokes, you know like
people in America They don't try as hard as Japan Like,

60
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:51,110
like, Japan will make, like, actual, like, I was so scared.

61
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:57,630
Kerala finally announced, like, a new season, but I couldn't
even tell if it was real.

62
00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:00,250
I was like, please don't be April Fool's.

63
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:03,230
Please don't be a sick April Fool's joke.

64
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:05,150
Because they've done this before.

65
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:11,910
They will release, like, fully animated trailers and just be
like, Kiki, April Fool's.

66
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:13,610
I swear, they've done it.

67
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:15,050
They did it for Panty and Star.

68
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:16,710
I remember they did it for Panty and Star.

69
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:24,450
before they actually announced like they did that before for
Pantheon stocking and it hurt it actually hurt so much so I

70
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:34,010
couldn't tell I couldn't tell so like anyway um before I
posted my schedule I was actually waiting to see if like

71
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:45,790
Japan was gonna release anything similar to the murder of
Sonic the Hedgehog so I can be like so I could I could be

72
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:48,670
like I could be like I could be like, okay, I could get in
on this.

73
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:50,190
The FOMO.

74
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:51,310
Flavor of the Month.

75
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:59,290
I could get in on the April Fool's flavor of the month if
they released another game on April Fool's.

76
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:00,870
But they didn't.

77
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:03,670
They didn't release anything new.

78
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:05,390
I was so sad.

79
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:07,390
I was like, oh my God.

80
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:10,470
No April Fool's flavor of the month.

81
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:12,110
What is this?

82
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:20,310
How would we stream or survive without our regularly
released content.

83
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:21,910
Oh my god.

84
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:24,370
We need new content.

85
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:25,830
But it's okay.

86
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:26,310
It's okay.

87
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:28,470
I haven't played the murder of Sonic the Hedgehog.

88
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:30,730
So it's almost new for all of us.

89
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:32,630
It's almost new.

90
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:37,750
The real April 4th.

91
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:43,190
No fucking free games to play on April 4th.

92
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:45,130
How is this possible?

93
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:55,710
So yes, anyway, Maddie, thank you for the super chat, thank
you, thank you, I had a ratatouille flashback moment with

94
00:09:55,710 --> 00:10:03,130
the intro, thank you, thank you, thank you, don't worry
guys, um, in two hours, I think I scheduled it for two

95
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:12,290
hours, uh, the, uh, the, the full intro will be uploaded as
a video, so do not, oh my god, Sonic!

96
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:16,450
The game was actually developed by the social team.

97
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:18,150
Oh my god!

98
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:19,390
America!

99
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:21,530
Fuck yeah!

100
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:26,050
Oh my god!

101
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:32,310
If I can get fact checked by anybody, I'm happy with Sonic
the Hedgehog.

102
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:34,910
I'm so...

103
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:38,070
Sonic the Hedgehog!

104
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:39,950
Where is my sequel?

105
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:41,610
What happened?

106
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:46,250
The Sega of America!

107
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:59,650
I'm happy that you know what I'm not upset that I got like
um actually because I got um who else all right who else

108
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:07,790

Hedgehog though come on I wear that pride I wear that with

109
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:09,930

110
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:23,050

112
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:44,310
knowledge of whatever this game is the only thing i know
about this game is that I saw a screenshot of like Sonic

113
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:55,990
doing the Yamcha pose so like that is like literally my only
like point of knowledge for this game okay and then I looked

114
00:11:55,990 --> 00:12:05,210
at the also by the way how's the sound by the way um is the
is the sound okay that's actually crazy though oh my god

115
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:16,730
Sonic I can't believe the official Sonic team is here
watching a tomato play this game a year late by the way okay

116
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:26,570
so like i know it's not just a visual novel because um i was
looking okay let's see if my sound guys awake uh all right

117
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:34,370
they're not in my chat so i said they're not awake oh and
they are they are in my chat okay i know that there's more

118
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:44,830
to this because i looked at assist mode and why the fuck is
there in this in invincibility and uh invincibility and then

119
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:57,310
remove pitfalls and I was like oh this is not a regular this
is not a regular visual novel I was just like this is what

120
00:12:57,310 --> 00:13:07,130
do you mean pitfalls what does this mean this is not a
regular this is there's a journalist mode why is there a

121
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:13,930
journalist mode Anyway, um, yes, don't mind a knife.

00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:15,310
I'm just making my salad.

123
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:22,530
So, um, if anybody, like, uh, if anybody gets stabbed, they,
it wasn't my fault.

124
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:24,150
They walked into it, okay?

125
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:32,050
Like, okay, I'm just saying if I start walking around,
extending my arm out, holding a knife, and, like, I just

126
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:37,830
walk forward, is it really my fault if somebody else walks
into my knife?

127
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:39,910
Is it really my fault?

128
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:47,590
I would say that like it would be an act It was like their
fault for being stupid enough to walk into my knife Okay

129
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:55,770
guys like how is that my fault like they could just you know
They could just like walk the other way like oh my god just

00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:31,910
Yes.

168
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:33,950
Oh my god, that's me.

169
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:37,830
Hope passengers can read my scribble.

170
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:40,770
believe it.

171
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:42,670
I'm an official Sonic OC.

172
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:47,220
Dining car.

173
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:52,210
Uh-oh.

174
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:53,430
Am I nervous?

175
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:55,970
Is this first day on the job jitters?

176
00:15:56,950 --> 00:15:59,870
Working the train's dining car can be so... See?

177
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:01,050
This is why I have a knife.

178
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:01,810
I'm a chef.

179
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:05,670
Come on, Tokimido VFPS VTube.

180
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:06,550
Shake it off.

181
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:08,490
Slap.

182
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:11,670
Tokimido FPS V...

183
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:12,650
Okay.

184
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:14,470
Maybe it was a bad idea.

185
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:17,270
You had to have an incredibly long name.

186
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:20,170
Dokey Mado FPS VTube.

187
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:23,190
Did I just see you hitting yourself?

188
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:26,290
Mr. Conductor, sir.

189
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:28,350
How are you doing this morning?

190
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:32,010
Oh, quite all right myself.

191
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:35,090
Though feeling a little bit bittersweet.

192
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:37,670
Is that because you're...

193
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:41,530
Guys, guys, I need a promotion.

194
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:42,210
Okay.

195
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:44,470
I have a family.

196
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:45,550
to feed.

197
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:48,050
The family is me.

198
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:52,610
Oh, trying to butter me up on the very first day, are we?

199
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:57,110
Alas, today is my last day as the conductor.

200
00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:01,830
I'm retiring after 32 wonderful years.

201
00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:07,550
Time for me and the Mirage Express to say goodbye to one
another.

202
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:11,890
Oh, congratulations on retirement, sir.

203
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:15,630
My wife is...

204
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:16,570
Oh, he has a...

205
00:17:16,570 --> 00:17:17,230
No, it's okay.

206
00:17:17,690 --> 00:17:18,810
I can be the...

207
00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:19,850
I can be the...

208
00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:21,990
The trading side.

209
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:25,790
Very excited about it.

210
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:30,790
She's already got our plane tickets to Spagonia Unlocked.

211
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:31,550
Oh, locked.

212
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:34,570
Our shower's been on the fritz.

213
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:37,470
So I'm excited to use the hotels.

214
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:38,150
Ha ha.

215
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:42,570
I can see why his wife's excited.

216
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:44,470
Enough of my...

217
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:53,310
quibbles today is your first day working the dining car
here's the menu for today menu added to your inventory oh i

218
00:17:53,310 --> 00:18:02,110
got the menu i can open up the inventory at any time to see
what's on that menu it features chili dog instant ramen and

219
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:12,970
chicken cordon i like how instant ramen is in there it looks
so fancy imagine eating like instant ramen at such a fancy

220
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:15,250
vip there's a fucking Chandelier.

221
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:19,310
How is there like a chandelier in this fucking...

222
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:21,650
Like, in this train.

223
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:23,730
I don't know.

224
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:30,030
I feel like having a chandelier on a moving train seems
incredibly fucking dangerous.

225
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,130
Why do you look so nervous?

226
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:36,530
All we have on the train is a microwave.

227
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:38,510
Ha-ha-ha-ha.

228
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:43,350
Though, I'm sure a little quiz is in order.

229
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:44,390
A quiz?

230
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:56,510
which of these do we serve in the dining car oh chicken oh i
read okay guys for april fools the biggest joke right now is

231
00:18:56,510 --> 00:19:10,770
that i can read ding ding ding glad you can read the menu
okay a little about the vessel this is a state of the art

232
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:16,070
high speed smart train with all the latest gadgets.

233
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:22,110
The train can really handle anything you throw at it, but
yet we serve instant ramen?

234
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:25,710
We've had a lot of ventures together.

235
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:27,470
Me and this train.

236
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:29,970
It's not easy to leave.

237
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:35,230
After 32 years, I don't blame him for being wistful.

238
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:39,930
This train is exclusively used for events.

239
00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:42,490
It's not a passenger train.

240
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:50,310
all the but no all the budget went to the fucking chandelier
imagine eating instant ramen with champagne and chandeliers

241
00:19:50,310 --> 00:20:01,950
i remember that from the interview what's the event today a
murder mystery party wait you mean sonic isn't actually dead

242
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:06,090
i got clickbaited sonic team

243
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:15,150
i can't believe he's not actually dead What's the point?

244
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:16,770
What is...

245
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:24,350
Nothing better than some thrillers to end my tenure as
conducted.

246
00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:32,430
Guests will be funneled here to the dining car as a home
base, so to speak.

247
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:39,210
I'll be with you to gather tickets, but after that, you'll
be on your own.

248
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:43,310
So I'll need you to do everything in your power to make sure
you're safe.

249
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:47,170
make sure our paying guests are well taken care of.

250
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:52,830
I can't afford to lose my job.

251
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:54,630
This is all I have left.

252
00:20:55,610 --> 00:20:56,610
You sure can't.

253
00:20:56,990 --> 00:20:58,850
The severance pay is lousy.

254
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:00,150
Voa-ha-ha-ha.

255
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:04,930
Doors to the Mirage Express are opening.

256
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:07,010
All aboard!

257
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:11,430
I can't believe Sonic is actually still alive.

258
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:12,270
I know!

259
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:13,310
What?

260
00:21:13,330 --> 00:21:30,610

that's so messed up oh Amy wow oh sorry wait wow this train

261
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:42,670

sounds like he's a he's a gator you're right devs I could

262
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:45,390
get used to staying on a train like this.

263
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:47,870
What do you expect?

264
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:53,170
You know, I always go all out for my birthday party.

265
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:55,890
Oh, shit.

266
00:21:57,630 --> 00:21:57,630
Um.

267
00:21:59,530 --> 00:22:00,150
Um.

268
00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:04,730
Guys, I could never do like Rouge justice.

269
00:22:07,290 --> 00:22:08,010
Um.

270
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:13,270
This train is as elegant as you are.

271
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:14,230
Amy.

272
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:18,690
I can't promise I won't take anything, though.

273
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:22,450
Oh, wait, shit.

274
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:23,790
Fuck, there's so many voices.

275
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:29,170
Guys, I can't keep up to date with all these voices.

276
00:22:29,770 --> 00:22:33,710
Um, whoa, calm down there, Rouge.

277
00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:37,270
Did I not just catch you stealing from the train station
gift shop?

278
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:38,370
Howdy.

279
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:42,690
That was my best country accent.

280
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:47,170
It was a pen, knucklehead.

281
00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:49,210
Who's gonna miss me?

282
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:51,810
A teeny tiny pen.

283
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:55,620
What cast of characters am I stuck with?

284
00:22:58,210 --> 00:22:59,310
Get a hold of yourself.

285
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:01,550
Doki made a FPS V-tube.

286
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:04,290
You're sweating through your uniform.

287
00:23:05,810 --> 00:23:06,310
Oh, shit.

288
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:10,150
Oh, my God.

289
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:11,590
It's the star.

290
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:12,550
It's him.

291
00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:14,250
Are you still here?

292
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:15,290
That's you!

293
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:20,030
Oh my god!

294
00:23:21,010 --> 00:23:21,810
That's him!

295
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:24,670
Okay, the main character!

296
00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:28,110
Um, wait, let me get into the...

297
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:29,390
Let me get into the mindset.

298
00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:30,970
Chili dogs, chili dogs.

299
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:32,570
Chili dogs, chili dogs.

300
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:36,070
Hey pal, can't get one of those chili dogs?

301
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,440
They're both the same answer.

302
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,960
What a lovely day to be.

303
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:47,900
alive and not dead.

304
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,560
This is an illusion of choice.

305
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,000
It's literally the same answer.

306
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:56,700
Okay, radio friend.

307
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:58,960
Well, aren't you friendly?

308
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:03,320
Why can't I be normal for one second?

309
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:09,840
Sonic, wait until I announce everyone's rules to get food.

310
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:14,900

You never introduced yourself.

316

Oh my god!

317
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:52,080
This is my actual Sonic OC.

318
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:54,380
Here.

319
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:57,840
Thank you.

320
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,260
Everything is in order.

321
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:02,320
He seems concerned about something.

322
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,340
You know how I wish?

323
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:11,480
What would be the best gift in the whole world if they like
re-released the Shadow game where he holds a gun?

324
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,100
I feel like...

325
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:14,520
Please... I don't understand!

326
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:20,980
Why we don't have, we have so many remakes, but not the one
where we saved the president.

327
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:26,800
The most important, we make it the most, the most important
game of all.

328
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:31,080
I want to fucking be shadowed a hedgehog and shoot somebody.

329
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:32,740
Like, I don't understand.

330
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,780
I don't understand why we can't have that.

331
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:37,680
Why we don't have that.

332
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:42,060
Is there anything we can help you with?

333
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,060
Hmm.

334
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,380
Do you sell gift bags here?

335
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:54,940
Um, no, sadly, but I have a plastic grocery bag in the back
I could get for you.

336
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:57,180
Hmm.

337
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,120
That's fair.

338
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:00,600
Oh, so cold.

339
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:04,200
Doki made a FPS V-tube.

340
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:05,440
You're shivering.

341
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:07,520
Do you need me to fetch your jacket?

342
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,480
Oh my gosh, what would your wife think?

343
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:11,060
Oh, no.

344
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:11,920
No, I'm good.

345
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:14,040
He's so cool.

346
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,560
He's so fucking cool.

347
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:21,500
Howdy.

348
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:23,280
God, please get your ticket.

349
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:27,780
I think that's a ticket.

350
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:31,700
But I really don't want to argue with this guy.

351
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:34,740
Everything looks good.

352
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:35,960
Thank you.

353
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:40,980
Seems the conductor doesn't want to argue either.

354
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:48,460
Can I get your ticket, youngin?

355
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:51,760
Right here, sir.

356
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:53,880
Thank you.

357
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,900
May I offer you any of the snacks we have on board?

358
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,240
No, thank you.

359
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:03,940
When I travel, I always pack my own sparkle gelatin.

360
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:08,540
It's a sparkly jelly that can melt any jaded heart.

361
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:12,720
No way I brought my own sparkle gelatin.

362
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:13,780
with me too.

363
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:17,400
It's my first day, and I was a little nervous.

364
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,740
Oh my god, we're gonna be best friends, Tails.

365
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:24,900
Honestly, always be, like, really good friends with, like,
the smart kid.

366
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:30,920
Because, like, they'll always have your... Because, like,
the reason why is that what if they become a millionaire?

367
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:40,160
It's like, they'll become the millionaire, and then you'll
always get, like, very expensive gifts later on.

368
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:41,580
Also, they're good friends, too, by the way.

369
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:42,420
It's not always a bum.

370
00:27:46,370 --> 00:27:50,390
But it's not always about the money, you know, it's not
always about the money.

371
00:27:50,450 --> 00:27:51,410
It'll be really good friends.

372
00:27:51,890 --> 00:27:59,490
But also, the bonus, the bonus is that they're like, oh,
don't you want, hey, you want that iPhone?

373
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:00,970
Don't worry, man.

374
00:28:01,030 --> 00:28:02,270
I just got my allowance.

375
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:03,650
Let me get that for you.

376
00:28:08,990 --> 00:28:10,110
Don't be nervous.

377
00:28:10,450 --> 00:28:12,170
You're doing great so far.

378
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:14,130
We're Sparkle Jelton.

379
00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:15,190
buddies.

380
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:17,490
Unless they become a doctor.

381
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:19,130
Then they don't make any money.

382
00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:21,310
Absolutely.

383
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:25,790
If you need anything, just let us know.

384
00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:29,410
Thank goodness someone's on this train is normal.

385
00:28:30,850 --> 00:28:31,690
Alright, let's see.

386
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:33,610
We'll talk to Sonic last.

387
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:38,330
May I have a ticket, please?

388
00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:41,610
Thank you very much.

389
00:28:41,870 --> 00:28:43,150
On top of it, if I see...

390
00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:52,430
On top of it, if I A princess such as myself Must always be
punctual Princess?

391
00:28:53,410 --> 00:28:54,670
Did she just say princess?

392
00:28:55,910 --> 00:28:58,190
I actually don't know the lore with her.

393
00:28:58,990 --> 00:29:05,310
I think like, I think Her and the chameleon, I don't really
Know much lore about them, but I think they're More like the

394
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:06,290
comics, right?

395
00:29:06,730 --> 00:29:07,010
Like

396
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:20,180
Um Blink Aren't they like, aren't they like more so like
like sonic comic characters because i don't know much about

397
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:33,400
blaze or uh or um the iguana kid or gator you don't mind me
asking are you visiting from somewhere a separate dimension

398
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:46,420

i'll hop back to my own dimension They're not a comic

399
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:46,700
character.

400
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,340
Wait, which, which game are they from?

401
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:53,520
I quite prefer the birthday cake from this world more than
on my own.

402
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:54,840
I'm excited.

403
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:56,920
I'm a bit excited.

404
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:06,140
Oh, oh, oh, you don't say.

405
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:09,700
Well, I hope you enjoy your stay, princess.

406
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:13,020
Many games.

407
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:17,620
I like how the Sonic 06 and the Sonic Rush people are
fighting each other right now.

408
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,300
And I'm just like, who's she?

409
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:21,940
Should I bow?

410
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:24,820
Do I bow before the princess?

411
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:27,400
What are you doing?

412
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:30,180
Please get up.

413
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:33,800
Why can I not win with this group?

414
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:35,920
Alright, let's see.

415
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:37,780
Who's...

416
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:37,960
He?

417
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:38,800
She?

418
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:39,860
He?

420
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:46,080
Of course.

421
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:49,440
Excellent.

wow ninjitsu that sounds like a lot of difficult training

426
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:43,020
can you cling on to walls cling on to walls what kind of
question is that we

427
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,000
Weeb!

428
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:52,140
I most certainly can.

429
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:56,880
The conductor looks a bit too smug at that answer.

430
00:31:58,500 --> 00:31:59,360
Alright, who else are you missing?

431
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:00,220
Okay, Amy.

432
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:01,220
Oh no, Gator.

433
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:03,500
Hello, my friend.

434
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:04,920
Can I get your ticket?

435
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:08,000
Yeah, of course.

436
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:13,680
As a gentleman of upsetting morals, I love to show you my...

437
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:14,920
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

438
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,640
Maybe not Maybe put that down.

439
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:21,240
Don't need to show me your ticket, man.

440
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:25,140
He seems to be avoiding eye contact.

441
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:28,120
Is something a miss, sir?

442
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:32,120
I seem to have misplaced my ticket.

443
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:35,580
Could you speak up a little bit?

444
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,040
I couldn't quite hear.

445
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:41,240
I misplaced my ticket.

446
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:42,840
I don't know where it is.

447
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,740
It's not hiding his embarrassment very.

448
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:58,320
well get out don't you worry we'll take a look around for
you and see if it turns up that would be amazing thanks a

00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:23,620

said well the birthday discount certainly helped it must not

451
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:35,280
have been important why does who doesn't love a good bargain
and a murder mystery train just sounds so exciting it's

452
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:47,580
right out of my alley who doesn't love a good thrill you see
I'm a girl who loves a good true crime pot oh no she's one

453
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:48,840
of those people.

454
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:52,540
Maybe I should leave her to have fun.

455
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:58,560
Before we move along for you, before we move along for you,
Miss.

456
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:00,660
Oh, have fun!

457
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:01,540
Thank you!

458
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,800
Where do I use this?

459
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:08,240
That unlocks any door on the train.

460
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:09,460
Happy birthday!

461
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:13,340
The birthday girl gets the birthday key.

462
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,220
It's practically tradition!

463
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:17,260
Wait, the birthday girl gets the cheat?

464
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:19,180
That's not fair.

465
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:22,920
Why the fuck does she get to play on journalist mode?

466
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,900
And I actually have to try.

467
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:26,660
Very useful.

468
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:28,940
We'll use this wisely.

469
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:29,800
Thank you.

470
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:31,160
Alright.

471
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:31,660
Fuck.

472
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:32,040
Okay.

473
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:32,520
Rouge.

474
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:35,700
Oh, fuck.

475
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:36,100
Okay.

476
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:38,820
Well, hello, you too.

477
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:43,600
Okay.

478
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:44,260
Sorry.

479
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:47,580
Well, hello, you too.

480
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:50,300
What can I do for you?

481
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:52,600
Good morning, ma'am.

482
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:54,420
Can we get your ticket?

483
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:56,920
My, my.

484
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,560
How forward.

485
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:01,360
Let me fetch it for you.

486
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:02,960
Wait, is it like in her?

487
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:11,180
Where did she get it?

488
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:15,460
Come back if you need anything else.

489
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:16,620
You hear?

490
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,420
Wow, she's so polite.

491
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:23,380
Very easy to talk to as well.

492
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:30,500
Ma'am, I saw you sneak that $20 bill out of my pocket.

493
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:31,180
Wait, what?

494
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:36,140
He has a wife!

495
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:40,540
And he already has a side...

496
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:43,140
He already has a trained wife, too.

497
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:51,560
I'm gonna have to kindly ask for that back.

498
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:53,860
Hmm.

499
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:59,160
Oh, this was yours?

500
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:01,520
Must have slipped out.

501
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:02,920
Here you go.

502
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:08,020
I may not actually be the best at judging characters.

503
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:10,060
Alright.

517
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:46,020
Well, do.

518
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:47,020
Thanks.

519
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:49,240
Oh, wait.

520
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:49,920
There's one more.

521
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:51,140
That's not a character.

522
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:53,260
Mmm, yummy.

523
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:54,920
Mmm, yummy.

524
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:56,940
Don't mind if I do.

525
00:37:58,540 --> 00:38:00,220
Dokimato FPS VTube.

526
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,560
Those are for our guests, you know.

527
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:04,700
Train.

528
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:10,460
Be sure Dokimato FPS VTube only gets one of those if they
ask.

529
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:12,640
Hmm.

530
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:14,560
Oh.

531
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:19,060
Okay, you're like, what about, like, there's metal Sonic.

532
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:19,540
Yes!

533
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:21,200
He's made of metal!

534
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:24,180
Like, he's fucking metal!

535
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:27,360
The Sonic's not made of metal!

536
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:30,060
Did the arms just kind of nod?

537
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:33,360
Actually, uh, Tring.

538
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:36,560
The conductor wants me to have the whole plate.

539
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:38,240
Hmm.

540
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:43,800
Good try, young buck.

541
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:49,460
The train and I have worked together for a long time.

542
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:52,960
You'll have to work harder than to get what you want.

543
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:57,240
Trat, those snacks look really tasty too.

544
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:02,900
But what about my OC, Jeremiah, the blue hedgehog, who looks
just like Sonic?

545
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:05,600
All right.

546
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:07,140
Did I talk to everybody?

547
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:08,540
Oh, wait.

548
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:09,460
What's this?

549
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,600
What's sticking out the napkin holder?

550
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,300
Oh, it's the Gators.

551
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:15,040
Ticket!

552
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:18,840
Say, wasn't someone looking for that ticket earlier?

553
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:22,540
Let's be sure to return this to its rightful owner.

554
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:26,260
Alright, let's make sure no one uses their ticket as a
napkin.

555
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:30,180
Alright, hello, I found your ticket.

556
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:34,640
Yeah, we might just have what you need.

557
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:37,300
Don't keep made our FPS V-Tube.

558
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:40,300
Why don't you show our friend here what we picked up?

559
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:42,280
Look, I found a menu.

560
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:46,380
I'll take one of each.

561
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:51,760
On second thought, maybe I'll wait a bit.

562
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:54,000
Jokey made a FPS VTube.

563
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:57,860
I was referring to the other thing we picked up.

564
00:39:58,820 --> 00:39:59,580
Oh, right.

565
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:00,100
Sorry.

566
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:00,860
Oh, no.

567
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:01,820
Maybe they're hungry.

568
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:06,120
If they want to order food, they'll have to pay for it and
then we get more money, right?

569
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:08,700
Can I...

570
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:09,900
Oh, it's the same thing.

571
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:10,240
Okay.

572
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:13,600
I was going to say, would he call me stupid if I do it
again?

573
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:16,000
Ah, here it is.

574
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:17,580
That's my ticket.

575
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,240
Thanks so much to you both.

576
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:25,760
Was really worried you kicked me out, and I missed a murder
mystery.

577
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:30,600
Oh, old Tokimido FPS V-Tube.

578
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:33,860
Here would have their hands full kicking you out.

579
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:36,100
You're right.

580
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:38,040
I want to leave without a fight.

581
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:41,100
Ha ha ha ha ha ha.

582
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:41,420
Whoa.

583
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:47,920
Wait, who made me both microwave expert and security guy?

584
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,300
Wait, am I the only staff here other than the train?

585
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:53,260
Where are the other people?

586
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:55,420
Wait a minute.

587
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:57,740
Where are the other Sonic OCs?

588
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:04,400
You're both all right in my book.

589
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:06,320
Thanks again for the assist.

590
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:09,220
This is like the most unrealistic thing.

591
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:12,860
They're only being one self-insert Sonic OC.

592
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:25,000
just let us know if you need anything else okay everyone
time for me to read out everyone's roles for the murder

Assist Dokimato FPS VTube and they need any help, won't you?

598
00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:17,320
This is my self-insert Sonic OC fanfiction.

599
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:21,900
That's all I need to hear.

600

You have my trust.

601
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:29,360
Nothing more heartwarming than a conductor and his train.

602
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:33,460
Just me and my train wife.

603
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:45,200

place otter this train is state-of-the-art and our systems
were dealing with all of that for everything else please

605
00:42:53,600 --> 00:43:04,040

sounds good absolute okay Wait, they sound the same now.

606
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:04,900
Oh, no.

607
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:09,980
I made Tails and Sonic sound the same and I didn't realize
because I could only do three voices.

608
00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:13,580
Absolutely.

609
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:16,540
Will do.

610
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:19,060
Okay, bye now.

I like that guy.

612
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:28,320
Thank you all for following the outfit guide.

613
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:30,820
I sent you your look.

614
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:31,160
Oh, yeah.

615
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:41,840
By the way, do you guys know like Mirage from Apex Voices
Sonic the Hedgehog I said you all look amazing I trust you

616
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:52,020
all read your lore cards as well Lore cards That must be the
details of their motivations I suppose it makes sense Lore

617
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:59,120
cards aren't read out loud Otherwise people will know the
murderous intentions Yeah you guys didn't know that It's the

618
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:00,200
same voice actor

619
00:44:03,860 --> 00:44:08,340
Yeah Now, on to the nitty-gritty for the murder mystery
game.

620
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:12,620
One of you will be murdered, and the rest are suspects.

621
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:17,940
Man, I wonder who's going to be murdered in the murder of
Sonic the Hedgehog.

622
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:25,140
Everyone has assigned roles for characters they will be
playing.

623
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:29,880
Participation is required, for it is my birthday.

624
00:44:34,530 --> 00:44:35,170
Of course.

625
00:44:37,210 --> 00:44:39,910
Birthday girl, mix the rules.

626
00:44:41,630 --> 00:44:44,030
Sonic, you are a ship captain.

627
00:44:44,770 --> 00:44:48,050
And you'll be stationed in the conductor car.

628
00:44:49,350 --> 00:44:52,270
Naturally, that's where the captain would go.

629
00:44:53,610 --> 00:44:56,810
Tails, you are the detective.

630
00:44:57,790 --> 00:45:00,510
You'll be here in the dining car.

631
00:45:02,010 --> 00:45:02,890
Indubitably.

632
00:45:04,430 --> 00:45:05,970
Knuckles, you're...

633
00:45:05,990 --> 00:45:07,150
Do I do remoralses?

634
00:45:08,670 --> 00:45:09,190
Okay.

635
00:45:09,910 --> 00:45:12,390
I assume you guys are remembering this for me.

636
00:45:12,490 --> 00:45:14,390
Because I definitely do not remember already.

637
00:45:15,350 --> 00:45:15,870
Tails.

638
00:45:16,490 --> 00:45:16,770
Okay.

639
00:45:17,010 --> 00:45:18,850
Sonic is in the conductor car.

640
00:45:19,350 --> 00:45:20,530
Tails is in the dining car.

641
00:45:22,050 --> 00:45:22,570
Knuckles.

642
00:45:23,290 --> 00:45:25,110
You are the sheriff.

643
00:45:25,670 --> 00:45:26,970
Around these parts.

644
00:45:27,650 --> 00:45:28,370
We'll find you.

645
00:45:28,470 --> 00:45:29,430
There's a saloon.

646
00:45:30,150 --> 00:45:31,270
It's a train.

647
00:45:32,710 --> 00:45:33,930
No wonder he's.

648
00:45:33,990 --> 00:45:34,110
Okay.

649
00:45:34,190 --> 00:45:35,750
Now I understand why he's a cowboy.

650
00:45:35,990 --> 00:45:39,690
We'll find you in the saloon.

651
00:45:40,670 --> 00:45:41,590
Got it.

652
00:45:42,670 --> 00:45:44,910
Rouge, you are a business tycoon.

653
00:45:45,510 --> 00:45:48,530
And Blaze, you're a titan of industry.

654
00:45:49,230 --> 00:45:50,850
Both in the casino.

655
00:45:52,270 --> 00:45:53,690
What's the difference?

656
00:45:54,710 --> 00:45:55,830
There is none.

657
00:45:57,490 --> 00:45:57,690
Hmm.

658
00:45:59,690 --> 00:46:00,670
Sounds fun.

659
00:46:02,310 --> 00:46:04,190
Vector, you're the butcher.

660
00:46:05,010 --> 00:46:09,810
And SPO, The poet, both found in the light.

661
00:46:09,890 --> 00:46:12,190
Wait, why the fuck is the butcher in the library?

662
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:14,450
Wouldn't a butcher be in the dining car?

663
00:46:14,570 --> 00:46:15,630
This doesn't make sense, Amy.

664
00:46:15,750 --> 00:46:17,050
You already fucked it up.

665
00:46:18,730 --> 00:46:21,230
Both found in the library.

666
00:46:21,350 --> 00:46:22,690
Like, all the other ones fit.

667
00:46:22,790 --> 00:46:25,750
Why the fuck is the butcher in the library?

668
00:46:26,510 --> 00:46:28,910
Unless it's forbidden love.

669
00:46:29,370 --> 00:46:30,490
Oh my god, I'm cooking.

670
00:46:31,130 --> 00:46:33,190
This is my self-insert fan fiction.

671
00:46:36,370 --> 00:46:39,870
Very, very educated butcher.

672
00:46:42,810 --> 00:46:46,270
Both found in the library.

673
00:46:47,730 --> 00:46:48,670
Hear that, Espio?

674
00:46:49,130 --> 00:46:51,030
We get to hang out together.

675
00:46:52,390 --> 00:46:53,190
And do what?

676
00:46:53,470 --> 00:46:57,150
Oh, yeah, what are we going to do?

677
00:46:57,670 --> 00:46:58,290
Reign.

678
00:47:02,570 --> 00:47:05,970
Maybe we can make...

679
00:47:05,990 --> 00:47:08,410
A tower of books or something.

680
00:47:09,850 --> 00:47:10,970
Books.

681
00:47:13,750 --> 00:47:14,570
Books.

682
00:47:15,630 --> 00:47:17,970
Shadow is the locksmith.

683
00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:20,750
Hanging out in the lounge.

684
00:47:25,010 --> 00:47:31,850
And last but not least, me, the journalist reporter.

685
00:47:32,890 --> 00:47:35,810
I'll be moseying around with everyone.

686
00:47:37,090 --> 00:47:39,510
Did you get all that?

687
00:47:41,950 --> 00:47:46,090
Yeah, a tower made up of books.

688
00:47:52,730 --> 00:47:54,790
Did I have the April Fools?

689
00:47:56,230 --> 00:47:58,450
Oh my god, actual journalist mode.

690
00:47:58,810 --> 00:48:01,070
Oh my god, she's actually a journalist.

691
00:48:04,910 --> 00:48:05,970
Don't worry.

692
00:48:05,990 --> 00:48:27,970
I'll do your Don't worry I'll do your Decima Will she Okay,
I don't want her to repeat that Um Um I was listening Hope

693
00:48:27,970 --> 00:48:30,310
that's okay Stop

694
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:39,550
More than alright You can help ensure everyone's following
their rules.

695
00:48:40,450 --> 00:48:42,190
Oh, that reminds me.

696
00:48:43,330 --> 00:48:43,670
Oh, shit.

697
00:48:43,890 --> 00:48:44,690
Thank God I have a map.

698
00:48:45,330 --> 00:48:47,290
I have a map for each of you.

699
00:48:48,870 --> 00:48:51,930
Everyone's station is marked on the map as well.

700
00:48:52,130 --> 00:48:52,970
How convenient.

701
00:48:55,170 --> 00:48:56,590
Map added to my inventory.

702
00:48:56,730 --> 00:48:57,150
Oh, thank God.

703
00:48:57,250 --> 00:48:57,870
I won't get lost.

704
00:48:58,010 --> 00:48:59,690
Okay, guys, I don't need you guys to help me remember.

705
00:48:59,930 --> 00:49:00,510
I have a map.

706
00:49:01,110 --> 00:49:03,110
The rules or the games are as followed.

707
00:49:03,610 --> 00:49:05,730
There is a murder amongst you all.

708
00:49:05,990 --> 00:49:13,290
The murderer can kill a single participant, however they
choose, but you must physically be present with the victim

709
00:49:13,290 --> 00:49:14,650
for it to count.

710
00:49:17,030 --> 00:49:24,510
Everyone else must collect evidence throughout the train and
use it to integrate, interrogate fellow passengers to figure

711
00:49:24,510 --> 00:49:25,990
out who's done it.

712
00:49:27,010 --> 00:49:33,270
The murder will lie to get out of being accused, so inspect
everything you can.

713
00:49:34,050 --> 00:49:34,910
Find clues.

714
00:49:37,030 --> 00:49:38,390
And interrogate.

715
00:49:39,390 --> 00:49:40,570
Oh my god, it's like Phoenix Wright.

716
00:49:40,910 --> 00:49:41,830
And among us.

717
00:49:42,810 --> 00:49:44,150
I'll set a time for you.

718
00:49:44,150 --> 00:49:44,930
One hour.

719
00:49:45,310 --> 00:49:48,790
So everyone can mingle and the murder can do their thing.

720
00:49:49,370 --> 00:49:50,510
Is everyone ready?

721
00:49:51,030 --> 00:49:51,430
Yeah!

722
00:49:51,910 --> 00:49:52,670
Let's play!

723
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:55,170
Sounds like everyone's excited!

724
00:49:55,550 --> 00:49:55,870
Yeah!

725
00:49:56,890 --> 00:49:57,990
Stop, stop.

726
00:50:01,590 --> 00:50:03,710
Everyone at your stations!

727
00:50:09,630 --> 00:50:11,810
All right, let's find some clues.

728
00:50:12,130 --> 00:50:13,010
Can someone die yet?

729
00:50:13,550 --> 00:50:15,170
Ah, this is so exciting!

730
00:50:17,370 --> 00:50:20,570
Our mystery is unfolding right under our very noses!

731
00:50:21,670 --> 00:50:22,410
How thrilling!

732
00:50:22,590 --> 00:50:24,330
I know, it's kind of scary!

733
00:50:25,310 --> 00:50:26,390
Oh, man, I'm...

734
00:50:26,390 --> 00:50:27,170
Oh, man!

735
00:50:27,430 --> 00:50:28,630
I'm nervous too!

736
00:50:29,730 --> 00:50:32,810
Shouldn't you two be out here mingling with everyone?

737
00:50:32,950 --> 00:50:34,810
Yeah, detective, do your fucking job!

738
00:50:35,410 --> 00:50:37,090
Who hired this kid to be a detective?

739
00:50:37,250 --> 00:50:37,950
He's a child!

740
00:50:38,890 --> 00:50:44,470
Well, actually, the detective and the journalist can't be
the murderer.

741
00:50:45,610 --> 00:50:46,350
Wait, why can't they?

742
00:50:46,690 --> 00:50:48,410
They can fucking kill if they want to.

743
00:50:48,930 --> 00:50:52,610
Like, I think killing as a detective is like the perfect
alibi.

744
00:50:54,330 --> 00:50:55,830
It can't arrest me if I'm the law.

745
00:50:56,810 --> 00:51:01,350
So we're stuck here for an hour before going out and scoping
the place.

746
00:51:02,290 --> 00:51:05,250
This way, there's always a neutral party.

747
00:51:07,810 --> 00:51:08,810
Makes sense to me.

748
00:51:09,650 --> 00:51:17,970
seems as though Amy's more excited about deciphering the
mystery anyway what do you think everyone's doing I don't

749
00:51:17,970 --> 00:51:25,310
know murder except for the people in the library they're
doing something else oh probably inspecting their stations

750
00:51:25,310 --> 00:51:36,850
and talking amongst one another everyone has a role to play
so they must be exploring their characters do you know what

751
00:51:36,850 --> 00:51:38,730
their character motivations are Amy

752
00:51:41,810 --> 00:51:49,870
no the lore cards are confidential no one knows but the
person who received wait but who made the lore cards i

753
00:51:49,870 --> 00:51:57,150
thought you made it amy didn't you distribute them oh what's
this wait i thought we're not supposed to know your lore

754
00:51:57,150 --> 00:52:08,150
tales oh my god minus one rp my backstory is that i was best
friends with a flicky that decided to join the evil doctor

755
00:52:08,150 --> 00:52:13,390
igman kick-starting my desire for justice in the world.

756
00:52:16,710 --> 00:52:20,710
My lore is that I'm a nosy person turned to a journalist.

757
00:52:21,150 --> 00:52:22,450
She's so happy about that.

758
00:52:24,010 --> 00:52:25,410
Not gonna lie.

759
00:52:26,150 --> 00:52:28,130
That kind of sounds fun.

760
00:52:30,030 --> 00:52:32,890
I wish I wasn't stuck on microwave duty.

761
00:52:34,250 --> 00:52:34,290
Huh?

762
00:52:36,410 --> 00:52:36,810
Huh?

763
00:52:38,070 --> 00:52:38,870
The...

764
00:52:38,870 --> 00:52:40,610
The train started moving!

765
00:52:41,630 --> 00:52:43,150
It's so fast!

766
00:52:43,490 --> 00:52:44,890
Grab onto something!

767
00:52:46,130 --> 00:52:47,570
What is going on?

768
00:52:47,690 --> 00:52:49,230
Wait, a train isn't supposed to move?

769
00:52:49,350 --> 00:52:50,550
It's a fucking train.

770
00:52:51,490 --> 00:52:52,690
I'm slipping!

771
00:52:54,130 --> 00:52:55,130
Hold on!

772
00:52:56,370 --> 00:52:57,570
I can't!

773
00:52:57,930 --> 00:53:00,050
What would be a shame if that chandelier fell?

774
00:53:03,390 --> 00:53:05,510
Plus one RP for me.

775
00:53:05,950 --> 00:53:06,890
I'm so immersed.

776
00:53:07,150 --> 00:53:08,430
Guys, am I immersing you?

777
00:53:09,250 --> 00:53:09,910
No!

778
00:53:13,470 --> 00:53:14,130
Oh,

779
00:53:21,420 --> 00:53:21,420
shit.

780
00:53:21,660 --> 00:53:21,860
Don't worry.

781
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:23,820
Insurance covers all of this.

782
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:27,160
You're...

783
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:27,340
Wait.

784
00:53:27,580 --> 00:53:27,820
What?

785
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:29,720
This isn't a dining car.

786
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:31,560
Who moved this here?

787
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:34,220
It's like...

788
00:53:34,220 --> 00:53:34,880
Oh, my God.

789
00:53:35,220 --> 00:53:36,180
It's just like...

790
00:53:36,180 --> 00:53:38,540
It's as if I'm on the train right now.

791
00:53:39,980 --> 00:53:41,660
You're both awake.

792
00:53:42,700 --> 00:53:43,360
Yeah.

793
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:47,140
It seems the train has slowed down considerably.

794
00:53:49,420 --> 00:53:50,620
Wow, how exhilarating.

795
00:53:51,580 --> 00:53:52,280
I know!

796
00:53:52,980 --> 00:53:55,800
The production on this train is outstanding!

797
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:01,140
It's definitely more intense than I expected.

798
00:54:01,820 --> 00:54:04,980
I got a concussion and then we all got knocked out.

799
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:06,940
And now I have a concussion and we're here now.

800
00:54:07,540 --> 00:54:08,420
So immersive.

801
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:14,160
It seems we've been knocked into the dining car's closet.

802
00:54:15,620 --> 00:54:20,200
This train can't reach such incredible speeds.

803
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:24,960
We're getting our money's worth with this experience.

804
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:26,340
That's for sure.

805
00:54:27,540 --> 00:54:29,000
Is this actually intended?

806
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:33,060
This is my first day, so I'm not really sure.

807
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:37,400
I don't recall them warning me about this ending interview.

808
00:54:38,260 --> 00:54:40,460
You know I'm getting paid minimum wage for this too.

809
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:41,480
That's the worst part.

810
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:45,520
We should Check on the others.

811
00:54:46,100 --> 00:54:47,660
Doki Meido, FPS VTube.

812
00:54:48,140 --> 00:54:48,960
Could you get the door?

813
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:50,880
Of course.

814
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:53,520
Getting the door.

815
00:54:54,620 --> 00:54:54,760
Hmm.

816
00:54:55,540 --> 00:54:56,200
It seems that...

817
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:57,020
Oh, shit, really?

818
00:54:57,140 --> 00:54:58,120
I wonder by what?

819
00:54:59,780 --> 00:55:02,160
It seems the door is blocked.

820
00:55:02,620 --> 00:55:04,080
I don't think it's budging.

821
00:55:04,220 --> 00:55:04,880
Oh, shit.

822
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:07,800
What the fuck could be blocking the door?

823
00:55:08,340 --> 00:55:12,040
It can't be this fucking bookcase in front of me.

824
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:13,040
No.

825
00:55:19,100 --> 00:55:31,860
Amy Wait, am I actually, oh my god, I'm so fucking dumb Bro,
my Sonic OC is actually so stupid It was actually the

826
00:55:31,860 --> 00:55:42,800
fucking shelf That's blocking the door that's in front of me
Okay, alright The Sonic OC reflects the streamer Um Amy,

827
00:55:43,220 --> 00:55:47,220
give that falling shelf a whack or your pico-pico hammer.

828
00:55:49,020 --> 00:55:49,620
Hmm.

829
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:51,160
Huh?

830
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:55,120
Let's find another way out.

831
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:57,500
I'll, uh, start looking for clues.

832
00:55:59,100 --> 00:56:00,320
I'll search over here.

833
00:56:00,860 --> 00:56:01,600
She did it.

834
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:05,380
She's not the red heron.

835
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:06,520
She did it.

836
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:10,960
You thought she was on, you thought she can't be the
murderer, but she did it.

837
00:56:13,180 --> 00:56:13,780
Suss.

838
00:56:14,820 --> 00:56:17,000
It's always the first person.

839
00:56:19,140 --> 00:56:20,600
I know, Amy.

840
00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:23,500
She's hiding something.

841
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:29,220
I suppose she did wake up before us.

842
00:56:29,980 --> 00:56:31,280
Something could have happened.

843
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:40,060
Listen, I know I'm the detective here, but all the best
detectives have sidekicks.

844
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:42,140
And I'm going to need your help.

845
00:56:46,660 --> 00:56:52,730
Let's gather clues on why Amy is acting this way and
interrogate her about it.

846
00:56:53,820 --> 00:56:57,160
Check out everything you can around this closet.

847
00:56:58,120 --> 00:57:02,540
Then we'll show it to Amy to uncover the full situation.

848
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:05,740
Gather evidence and interrogate.

849
00:57:06,180 --> 00:57:06,460
Got it.

850
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:08,760
We're going to pull a phoenix right on her.

851
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:10,420
What's this?

852
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:14,160
I'll need you to do everything in your power to make sure.

853
00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:18,060
Make sure our paying guests are well taken care of.

854
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:21,680
Understood.

855
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:23,920
Alright.

856
00:57:24,740 --> 00:57:25,760
I guess I gotta act.

857
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:28,380
You can count on me, Tails.

858
00:57:28,740 --> 00:57:29,340
Don't worry.

859
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:36,540
I will make sure you'll have a great murder mystery party
while I get paid minimum wage on my first day.

860
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:41,840
I won't turn evil like your ex-flicky companion did.

861
00:57:44,180 --> 00:57:45,380
Happy to hear it.

862
00:57:45,740 --> 00:57:47,540
Now, let's get searching.

863
00:57:49,660 --> 00:57:49,760
Mmm.

864
00:57:50,100 --> 00:57:52,600
Awfully sweaty over there.

865
00:57:52,900 --> 00:57:53,360
Mmm.

866
00:57:54,380 --> 00:57:56,060
Pretty suspicious.

867
00:57:57,920 --> 00:57:59,800
Something's always hidden in the trash.

868
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:01,080
Let's check there.

869
00:58:02,740 --> 00:58:04,340
Sadly, it's empty.

870
00:58:05,460 --> 00:58:09,320
But on the bright side, this is a very clean trash bin.

871
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:13,740
How do I become as optimistic as a kid because he's a child?

872
00:58:14,180 --> 00:58:18,760
They haven't realized how fucked up the real world is.

873
00:58:19,420 --> 00:58:21,060
Oh, to be a child again.

874
00:58:24,040 --> 00:58:26,000
What do you think, Tails?

875
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:28,980
Want me to cook any of this for you?

876
00:58:29,900 --> 00:58:31,080
When we get out of here?

877
00:58:31,260 --> 00:58:31,620
Sure!

878
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:35,140
I normally never make microwave meals.

879
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:37,160
I prefer to cook.

880
00:58:37,720 --> 00:58:38,440
My cast...

881
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:40,200
Oh my god, who let this child cook?

882
00:58:40,660 --> 00:58:43,800
My cast iron skillet has gotten a lot of use lately.

883
00:58:44,180 --> 00:58:48,080
I can cook a mean cast-iron pizza.

884
00:58:50,180 --> 00:58:51,720
I've only had Michael.

885
00:58:53,300 --> 00:58:54,320
I'm so poor.

886
00:58:55,180 --> 00:58:58,540
I've only had Michael with lunches this week.

887
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:01,020
Alright, let's see.

888
00:59:02,380 --> 00:59:04,680
Ah, the wet floor sign.

889
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:07,580
Keeping people alert and safe.

890
00:59:08,700 --> 00:59:11,000
I'm on the college diet right now.

891
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:14,860
Once I slipped on some spilled juice at the ground, grocery
store?

892
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:17,180
No wet floor sign at all.

893
00:59:18,380 --> 00:59:20,340
Luckily, Sonic was there to catch me.

894
00:59:20,500 --> 00:59:21,540
My hero.

895
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:22,840
Wow.

896
00:59:23,500 --> 00:59:25,380
Sonic really is as fast as they say.

897
00:59:26,140 --> 00:59:28,020
But he was going so fast!

898
00:59:28,380 --> 00:59:29,860
He also slipped on the juice!

899
00:59:31,220 --> 00:59:34,280
We slid into an older gentleman's shopping cart!

900
00:59:34,860 --> 00:59:35,880
Should have been me!

901
00:59:37,020 --> 00:59:40,040
Well, it's the thought that counts, I suppose.

902
00:59:40,760 --> 00:59:41,620
Super Posoda!

903
00:59:41,780 --> 00:59:42,460
Thank you, the Super Chat!

904
00:59:42,540 --> 00:59:43,340
Thank you, thank you!

905
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:45,400
Yo, I I didn't know you like Dango.

906
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:47,280
I actually love Dango Rampa.

907
00:59:47,840 --> 00:59:50,100
I fucking love Dango Rampa, man.

908
00:59:50,560 --> 00:59:52,780
I have so many actual, like, Dango Rampa.

909
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:53,280
Sorry.

910
00:59:53,860 --> 00:59:55,400
Not immersing anyone in here.

911
00:59:56,300 --> 00:59:58,500
Sorry, we're going to be out of immersive mood right now.

912
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:00,940
But, like, I actually fucking love that show.

913
01:00:01,060 --> 01:00:03,220
And I love the game as well.

914
01:00:03,660 --> 01:00:07,400
And I have, like, so many, like, Monocuma merch and stuff.

915
01:00:07,460 --> 01:00:08,440
Because I love Monocuma.

916
01:00:08,560 --> 01:00:12,200
Because the original voice actor for Monocuma was Doraemon.

917
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:25,760
and and I fucking love her work uh but yeah sorry back to
immersion the shelf blocking our exit it's currently not

918
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:39,840
budging hey dokey made a fbs v-tube look closely at this
wait is that from the oh wait that could be the hammer from

919
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:43,520
the something something hammer Pico-pico, hammer.

920
01:00:44,680 --> 01:00:47,620
I wonder how this side of the shelf got smashed.

921
01:00:49,560 --> 01:00:51,740
There's nothing this shelf could have fallen into.

922
01:00:52,340 --> 01:00:54,680
I'm not sure this damage wasn't here before.

923
01:00:55,380 --> 01:00:57,380
The train has too much upkeep.

924
01:00:58,700 --> 01:01:00,100
I feel like this is important.

925
01:01:00,980 --> 01:01:01,980
We should log it.

926
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:06,300
Check on the crack on the shelf is added to the inventory.

927
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:19,240
I'm pretty sure like Amy like fucking whacked this shelf or
something what what's this a rod wait is this wait that's

928
01:01:19,240 --> 01:01:29,160
the hammer it broke the the tip is broken it looks like i
don't have originally been attached to something i'm not

929
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:36,080
sure if it's related to our mystery but i like spinning it
around so we'll keep it stick is added to your inventory

930
01:01:36,080 --> 01:01:44,200
yeah this is the hammer it was amy's hammer i think we found
enough clues let's go Amy and find what really happened.

931
01:01:45,060 --> 01:01:46,700
Alright, Amy, I got you.

932
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:48,620
What's the latest?

933
01:01:48,800 --> 01:01:50,220
Oh my god, I never even talked to her before.

934
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:55,760
The game is afoot now, Amy.

935
01:01:57,120 --> 01:01:58,220
Find any clues yet?

936
01:01:59,300 --> 01:02:00,720
I found a spoon.

937
01:02:01,340 --> 01:02:04,820
If we find two more, we can dig ourselves out.

938
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:09,440
Dig ourselves out on a train?

939
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:12,040
Amy, you stupid bitch.

940
01:02:13,780 --> 01:02:23,260
huh okay that went like new grounds real quick uh i'll keep
looking all right start wait what do i want to talk to you

941
01:02:23,260 --> 01:02:32,000

start interrogation amy we believe you're hiding something

942
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:45,880
from us what you accuse me on my own birthday how dare you
This isn't going to be easy, is it?

943
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:47,500
It's my birthday!

944
01:02:48,980 --> 01:02:52,480
I've been stuck in here just like the two of you!

945
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:55,560
What in the world do you think I'm hiding?

946
01:02:57,480 --> 01:03:00,080
Amy was awake before Tails and I were.

947
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:02,420
What could she have done in that time?

948
01:03:02,760 --> 01:03:04,600
Oh no, what could she have done in that time?

949
01:03:05,460 --> 01:03:05,760
Okay.

950
01:03:07,140 --> 01:03:07,700
Michael.

951
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:10,960
Okay.

952
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:21,760
chili dog i told you i'm not eating until it's birthday cake
time let me think through this again amy was awake before

953
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:32,460
okay wait i wait i can just like say all the wrong answers
like there's no stakes involved okay attempted to okay

954
01:03:32,460 --> 01:03:41,680
attempted to escape why would she like break the fucking the
bookshelves i don't think you're saying ali wadoki meadow

955
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:53,200
fps tube and i were knocked out you attempted to escape the
closet prove it show more evidence that i attempted to

956
01:03:53,200 --> 01:04:02,640
escape or help me search for a way out do we have evidence
to prove that joki made oh fps b tube let me step you

957
01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:10,580
through this first find the correct piece of evidence from
your inventory you mean the only two evidence that i have

958
01:04:10,580 --> 01:04:21,380
once that has been deduced we must form our arguments to
fight back all right let's do it what proves amy attempted

959
01:04:21,380 --> 01:04:33,480
to escape the dining car closet okay there's this the stick
which is her hammer let's get wait what i mean you need the

960
01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:41,260
stick to hit the shelf oh i guess like the order goes with
shelf first and then and then like yo she'll be like but

961
01:04:41,260 --> 01:04:43,260
what did i use to escape.

962
01:04:43,480 --> 01:04:45,080
And it'll be like the hammer.

963
01:04:47,740 --> 01:04:47,900
What?

964
01:04:48,280 --> 01:04:52,140
Some damage on the shelf is supposed to approve something?

965
01:04:52,980 --> 01:04:54,080
It fell over.

966
01:04:54,780 --> 01:04:56,120
Damage makes sense.

967
01:04:57,460 --> 01:04:59,660
You don't have no argument there.

968
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:01,960
You're just grasping.

969
01:05:03,700 --> 01:05:04,820
Oh, okay, Tails.

970
01:05:04,940 --> 01:05:05,680
What now?

971
01:05:06,580 --> 01:05:09,140
Well, now we need to follow this train of thought.

972
01:05:09,500 --> 01:05:12,180
How does the crack on the shelf relate to Amy?

973
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:13,200
I don't know.

974
01:05:13,500 --> 01:05:16,220
What other possible evidence do I have?

975
01:05:16,620 --> 01:05:18,680
Oh, wait, I had two.

976
01:05:19,960 --> 01:05:21,960
So now I have to explain myself.

977
01:05:22,520 --> 01:05:27,900
See, uh, well, uh, when I get stumped, I like to think.

978
01:05:28,700 --> 01:05:29,080
What would...

979
01:05:30,700 --> 01:05:33,380
Okay, Sonic would not be thinking.

980
01:05:34,740 --> 01:05:36,960
What would Sonic do?

981
01:05:39,060 --> 01:05:41,020
What would Sonic do?

982
01:05:42,740 --> 01:05:44,920
Sonic's a force to be reckoned with.

983
01:05:45,260 --> 01:05:50,420
He's always running for it, collecting rings, crushing bad.

984
01:05:51,380 --> 01:05:52,840
He never loses.

985
01:05:54,900 --> 01:05:57,100
Like an endless runner game.

986
01:05:57,680 --> 01:05:59,940
I play a lot of this on my phone.

987
01:06:00,500 --> 01:06:01,100
Oh my god.

988
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:02,880
He's a TikTok kid.

989
01:06:03,080 --> 01:06:04,100
He's an iPad kid.

990
01:06:05,180 --> 01:06:06,920
Sure, whatever works.

991
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:12,180
Just close your eyes and...

992
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:12,580
Think.

993
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:17,300
What would Sonic do and find your argument?

994
01:06:18,120 --> 01:06:21,580
Well, Sonic could just, like, I don't know, run through the
door.

995
01:06:22,440 --> 01:06:26,760
Like, couldn't Sonic just break through the door with a
sheer speed force?

996
01:06:27,560 --> 01:06:29,980
Alright, let's prove we're not grasping.

997
01:06:30,560 --> 01:06:35,260
Let's follow the train of thought and fire a comeback like
Sonic would do.

998
01:06:36,220 --> 01:06:36,860
Think.

999
01:06:37,720 --> 01:06:38,700
Oh my god.

1000
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:40,340
Oh, wait, what the fuck?

1001
01:06:41,260 --> 01:06:41,900
Wait.

1002
01:06:42,200 --> 01:06:48,420
what okay all right what would sonic do

1003
01:06:51,740 --> 01:07:06,340
yes i'm ready what do you mean what else do i need press yes
i mean yes okay all right here you go all right time to

1004
01:07:06,340 --> 01:07:10,840
collect those rings oh my god i zoomed in out of accident
i'm sorry

1005
01:07:14,500 --> 01:07:27,120
Immersion B Oh my god It's because I'm playing the video
game They gave me a video game So I zoomed in

1006
01:07:31,960 --> 01:07:41,740
Give me a second I'm locked in

1007
01:07:47,260 --> 01:07:49,640
I'm locked in, give you a sec.

1008
01:07:52,420 --> 01:07:53,840
Okay, all right, here we go.

1009
01:07:55,060 --> 01:07:55,720
All right, I'm back.

1010
01:07:56,960 --> 01:07:58,240
I'm back now.

1011
01:07:58,920 --> 01:08:00,380
I'm a little bit bigger, though.

1012
01:08:00,940 --> 01:08:02,840
Wait, yeah, I'm really...

1013
01:08:02,840 --> 01:08:03,040
Whoa.

1014
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:11,420
Guys, keep being pretend it's all immersion.

1015
01:08:13,900 --> 01:08:16,520
Don't get unmerced, guys.

1016
01:08:17,300 --> 01:08:19,320
Don't get unmerced.

1017
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:22,660
Okay, we're back.

1018
01:08:23,180 --> 01:08:23,720
We're back.

1019
01:08:24,460 --> 01:08:25,720
Share the cell phone.

1020
01:08:26,540 --> 01:08:34,100
You're telling me on a train this well-kept that the damage
was here before we arrived?

1021
01:08:37,820 --> 01:08:39,580
Well, I...

1022
01:08:39,580 --> 01:08:42,180
I believe someone is responsible.

1023
01:08:42,200 --> 01:08:43,380
for hitting that shelf.

1024
01:08:44,300 --> 01:08:47,320
He just said nothing was around for the shelf to fall onto.

1025
01:08:49,020 --> 01:08:50,620
What was the shell hit with then?

1026
01:08:51,940 --> 01:08:52,200
Alright.

1027
01:08:52,480 --> 01:08:53,340
Your fucking hammer.

1028
01:08:53,640 --> 01:08:54,240
The stick.

1029
01:08:55,780 --> 01:08:56,520
What is that?

1030
01:08:56,680 --> 01:08:57,540
A stick?

1031
01:08:58,520 --> 01:09:03,360
You truly believe a stick could do this kind of damage.

1032
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:05,060
Think.

1033
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:07,080
Oh no, come on.

1034
01:09:09,360 --> 01:09:09,940
Okay.

1035
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:12,180
No way.

1036
01:09:12,200 --> 01:09:13,820
Now I know what invincible...

1037
01:09:13,820 --> 01:09:16,480
Why the fuck would you need invincibility mode on this?

1038
01:09:17,060 --> 01:09:17,580
Like...

1039
01:09:17,580 --> 01:09:18,740
Oh my god.

1040
01:09:19,260 --> 01:09:19,420
What?

1041
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:20,460
Oh okay, now I know.

1042
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:26,600
Guys, I now know why we need invincibility mode.

1043
01:09:30,220 --> 01:09:30,800
You're right.

1044
01:09:31,340 --> 01:09:32,940
A stick can do this kind of...

1045
01:09:32,940 --> 01:09:34,620
Can't do this kind of job...

1046
01:09:34,620 --> 01:09:36,900
Damage to the shelf on its own.

1047
01:09:37,740 --> 01:09:39,840
But if it's attached to something...

1048
01:09:39,840 --> 01:09:41,040
It could like...

1049
01:09:41,040 --> 01:09:41,760
Let's say...

1050
01:09:47,200 --> 01:09:49,380
This isn't a stick at all, is it?

1051
01:09:51,060 --> 01:09:54,400
It's actually the handle to your Pico Pico Hammer!

1052
01:09:58,060 --> 01:09:58,660
Sorry.

1053
01:10:03,740 --> 01:10:07,680
You attempted to hit the shelf out of the way, but you
failed.

1054
01:10:09,280 --> 01:10:12,520
The handle to your hammer snapped right off!

1055
01:10:17,340 --> 01:10:17,940
Oh!

1056
01:10:18,120 --> 01:10:18,580
Ah!

1057
01:10:24,430 --> 01:10:26,470
That's as Mubub said.

1058
01:10:27,510 --> 01:10:30,810
I tried to get his heart all out with my hammer.

1059
01:10:31,690 --> 01:10:32,830
But I failed.

1060
01:10:33,850 --> 01:10:45,660
I gave the shelf one big whack and then I figured it was no
big deal and I tried to hide it.

1061
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:50,220
But I suppose my embarrassment got the better of me.

1062
01:10:55,280 --> 01:10:58,860
I just look genuinely sorry about the situation.

1063
01:11:00,520 --> 01:11:03,140
I never expected your hammer to snap like that, Amy.

1064
01:11:03,740 --> 01:11:04,460
What is that?

1065
01:11:04,860 --> 01:11:06,160
Wish.com?

1066
01:11:07,240 --> 01:11:09,500
It was one of my backups.

1067
01:11:10,120 --> 01:11:12,260
It's a little lighter to carry around.

1068
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:14,800
I didn't think I needed it.

1069
01:11:16,140 --> 01:11:17,440
Well, lucky for you.

1070
01:11:17,780 --> 01:11:18,760
I'm a detective.

1071
01:11:19,380 --> 01:11:21,780
And I dabble as a mechanic.

1072
01:11:22,100 --> 01:11:25,120
The hammer's made of fucking wood tails.

1073
01:11:25,280 --> 01:11:28,620
Let me see both pieces of the hammer.

1074
01:11:32,340 --> 01:11:35,400
There's no way metal snaps like that.

1075
01:11:35,860 --> 01:11:36,840
There's no way.

1076
01:11:37,440 --> 01:11:39,060
That was a wood snap.

1077
01:11:42,560 --> 01:11:44,780
Just tighten things here.

1078
01:11:45,260 --> 01:11:47,220
A little elbow grease there.

1079
01:11:48,500 --> 01:11:49,220
And fixed.

1080
01:11:51,800 --> 01:11:52,640
Tails.

1081
01:11:53,200 --> 01:11:53,880
Thank you.

1082
01:11:55,460 --> 01:11:57,280
He's a carpenter's son.

1083
01:11:57,660 --> 01:11:58,440
He is.

1084
01:12:01,140 --> 01:12:02,980
They're all squeaky hammers.

1085
01:12:03,360 --> 01:12:05,160
How the fuck does plastic snap?

1086
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:07,440
Like, that still doesn't mean a mechanic.

1087
01:12:07,740 --> 01:12:08,480
It's plastic.

1088
01:12:11,400 --> 01:12:13,840
Classic, classic wood mechanic.

1089
01:12:14,920 --> 01:12:22,140
According to my calculations, if you hit the shelf right
here, it could do the trick.

1090
01:12:25,140 --> 01:12:28,600
Alright, stand back!

1091
01:12:30,420 --> 01:12:30,720
BOOM!

1092
01:12:32,480 --> 01:12:34,800
The shelf completely shattered!

1093
01:12:35,440 --> 01:12:36,320
Incredible!

1094
01:12:37,480 --> 01:12:40,080
That was a fucking squeaky toy.

1095
01:12:40,440 --> 01:12:43,080
Who the fuck said it was a squeaky toy earlier?

1096
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:45,880
She fucking destroyed the shelf!

1097
01:12:46,680 --> 01:12:48,520
No squeaky toy can do that!

1098
01:12:49,960 --> 01:12:51,160
We did it!

1099
01:12:51,340 --> 01:12:52,200
We're free!

1100
01:12:53,100 --> 01:12:54,760
Property damage.

1101
01:12:55,280 --> 01:12:57,500
Great job, Amy.

1102
01:12:57,760 --> 01:12:59,000
Let's get out of here.

1103
01:13:01,080 --> 01:13:02,800
It's super expensive.

1104
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:07,760
It's squeak, but it's metal, but it squeaks.

1105
01:13:09,120 --> 01:13:10,500
Wait, is that?

1106
01:13:12,080 --> 01:13:12,960
Sonic!

1107
01:13:14,040 --> 01:13:15,080
Oh, my God!

1108
01:13:15,980 --> 01:13:18,300
Who could have done such a thing?

1109
01:13:19,300 --> 01:13:21,300
He can't be.

1110
01:13:22,340 --> 01:13:25,260
I can't believe Sonic the Hedgehog died.

1111
01:13:25,280 --> 01:13:48,160
in the murder of Sonic the Hedgehog who would have thought
it can't be Sonic he's got no someone murdered my darling

1112
01:13:48,160 --> 01:13:59,880
Sonic looks like the game's begun I'm finding a Who did this
once at once?

1113
01:14:00,100 --> 01:14:01,540
Why is she so happy?

1114
01:14:03,160 --> 01:14:03,900
Amy, wait.

1115
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:05,900
I want to figure out who did this.

1116
01:14:06,700 --> 01:14:07,560
Wait for me.

1117
01:14:08,320 --> 01:14:11,300
Wait, what a whirlwind.

1118
01:14:11,780 --> 01:14:13,120
I'm exhausted already.

1119
01:14:14,080 --> 01:14:16,020
That was really convincing, Sonic.

1120
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:17,620
Yeah, Sonic.

1121
01:14:17,960 --> 01:14:19,260
You can stop now.

1122
01:14:21,620 --> 01:14:22,100
Sonic?

1123
01:14:25,460 --> 01:14:27,060
Hey, Sonic.

1124
01:14:27,120 --> 01:14:29,500
You can get up the gun now.

1125
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:31,960
Sonic?

1126
01:14:37,070 --> 01:14:37,450
And...

1127
01:14:37,450 --> 01:14:38,570
He's alive!

1128
01:14:41,050 --> 01:14:41,590
Body.

1129
01:14:42,650 --> 01:14:42,930
No.

1130
01:14:44,230 --> 01:14:44,990
Can't.

1131
01:14:46,030 --> 01:14:46,790
Move.

1132
01:14:47,450 --> 01:14:48,310
Oh my god.

1133
01:14:48,370 --> 01:14:49,110
What if it's Eggman?

1134
01:14:49,670 --> 01:14:51,110
What if it was Eggman all along?

1135
01:14:51,230 --> 01:14:54,010
Like the fucking, like, secret murderer?

1136
01:14:55,350 --> 01:14:56,990
Oh, what are you saying?

1137
01:14:57,690 --> 01:14:59,110
I don't understand.

1138
01:15:00,510 --> 01:15:06,290
I just need to rest.

1139
01:15:07,250 --> 01:15:08,090
Sonic?

1140
01:15:08,710 --> 01:15:09,330
Sonic?

1141
01:15:09,850 --> 01:15:10,270
Sonic!

1142
01:15:11,690 --> 01:15:13,550
Is he actually hurt?

1143
01:15:16,330 --> 01:15:17,350
Man, can't move.

1144
01:15:17,910 --> 01:15:18,890
Is he actually hurt?

1145
01:15:21,070 --> 01:15:21,470
Hey.

1146
01:15:22,490 --> 01:15:23,670
He's not moving.

1147
01:15:24,010 --> 01:15:26,450
Are those coins on him genuine?

1148
01:15:27,850 --> 01:15:31,870
My hands on his wrist I don't sense a pause.

1149
01:15:32,450 --> 01:15:35,790
My god, where did that voice come from?

1150
01:15:41,430 --> 01:15:43,710
Oh my god, there's no pause.

1151
01:15:44,550 --> 01:15:45,630
Sonic, talk to me.

1152
01:15:46,250 --> 01:15:48,030
Am I doing this right?

1153
01:15:48,530 --> 01:15:50,250
Why in the world is going on?

1154
01:15:52,210 --> 01:15:54,050
Is this part of the murder mystery?

1155
01:15:54,770 --> 01:15:56,550
Or is this serious?

1156
01:15:58,430 --> 01:15:58,990
Sonic!

1157
01:15:59,070 --> 01:15:59,950
Sonic!

1158
01:16:01,490 --> 01:16:03,670
Oh no, I feel myself panicking.

1159
01:16:04,790 --> 01:16:07,770
This is the most accurate depictions of panic attacks in an
animated game.

1160
01:16:08,650 --> 01:16:09,470
Calm down!

1161
01:16:09,990 --> 01:16:11,550
Donkey made a PSB tube!

1162
01:16:11,850 --> 01:16:13,550
What do I do?

1163
01:16:17,230 --> 01:16:25,610
Oh, I need you to do everything in your power to make sure
our paying guests are well taken care of.

1164
01:16:26,610 --> 01:16:26,790
Understood?

1165
01:16:28,490 --> 01:16:40,210
those guests are incredibly renowned which means they must
be remarkably rich you know my guy

1166
01:16:45,050 --> 01:16:55,550
so i leave their care to you doky madeo fpsb tube my
favorite employee my only employee surely you won't let me

1167
01:16:55,550 --> 01:16:57,430
down on this last ride.

1168
01:17:03,910 --> 01:17:05,870
It's my first day!

1169
01:17:07,470 --> 01:17:10,970
I need to catch up to Amy and Tails and get to the bottom of
this.

1170
01:17:11,450 --> 01:17:13,310
Even this is part of the game.

1171
01:17:13,810 --> 01:17:15,370
I just can't risk it.

1172
01:17:17,210 --> 01:17:18,910
I'll keep everyone safe, conductor.

1173
01:17:19,150 --> 01:17:19,570
You'll see.

1174
01:17:19,870 --> 01:17:21,550
I just need to feed Sonic the Rings!

1175
01:17:22,070 --> 01:17:24,050
I just got force- I'm sorry.

1176
01:17:24,450 --> 01:17:27,230
I just got force to feed him the Rings!

1177
01:17:28,070 --> 01:17:28,610
Yeah.

1178
01:17:29,690 --> 01:17:30,590
Alright, here we go.

1179
01:17:32,050 --> 01:17:32,350
Fudge top.

1180
01:17:32,470 --> 01:17:33,150
Thank you for the super chat.

1181
01:17:33,350 --> 01:17:33,890
Thank you.

1182
01:17:33,930 --> 01:17:35,070
He's definitely not.

1183
01:17:35,210 --> 01:17:35,530
Oh my god.

1184
01:17:35,710 --> 01:17:37,090
We've... Guys, we've made it.

1185
01:17:37,350 --> 01:17:39,350
We finally got through the tutorial.

1186
01:17:40,270 --> 01:17:42,230
It only took one hour.

1187
01:17:47,550 --> 01:17:50,010
We fucking did it.

1188
01:17:53,450 --> 01:17:54,490
Tutorial done.

1189
01:17:55,210 --> 01:17:55,570
Whoa.

1190
01:17:56,010 --> 01:17:57,210
Look at this place.

1191
01:18:00,890 --> 01:18:01,210
Oh.

1192
01:18:01,250 --> 01:18:03,550
Tails seems like the most competent one.

1193
01:18:04,050 --> 01:18:05,190
Hey, Tails, where were you?

1194
01:18:05,450 --> 01:18:06,330
Where are you?

1195
01:18:08,390 --> 01:18:10,090
Joki Mado, FPS VTube.

1196
01:18:10,610 --> 01:18:11,730
I'm over here.

1197
01:18:13,150 --> 01:18:15,270
I think Amy's already gone on ahead.

1198
01:18:15,830 --> 01:18:17,590
It seems she's really excited.

1199
01:18:18,250 --> 01:18:26,430
I bet you if there was like the Walking Dead or like, oh, X
amount of people chose this route, A or B or stuff.

1200
01:18:26,750 --> 01:18:31,050
I will not be surprised in maturity of the people picked
Tails.

1201
01:18:33,410 --> 01:18:39,160
It seems she's really excited Did you need something from
me?

1202
01:18:41,230 --> 01:18:43,650
Yeah, just a question really How do I put this?

1203
01:18:45,830 --> 01:18:47,770
What if Sonic is actually hurt?

1204
01:18:52,770 --> 01:19:03,710
Just force feed him rings He'll never be hurt He's laughing
Sonic doesn't go down so easily He's on a train full of his

1205
01:19:03,710 --> 01:19:07,210
friends Like nothing would actually happen to him.

1206
01:19:08,830 --> 01:19:11,930
We're all just really committed to the mystery for Amy.

1207
01:19:12,850 --> 01:19:15,770
You have nothing to worry about.

1208
01:19:16,310 --> 01:19:16,950
Promise.

1209
01:19:18,610 --> 01:19:23,110
Plus, Sonic likes to nap in a lot of strange spots.

1210
01:19:23,710 --> 01:19:25,170
He's fine.

1211
01:19:26,950 --> 01:19:28,130
It's making a lot of sense.

1212
01:19:28,750 --> 01:19:31,450
But I can't shake what Sonic said to me.

1213
01:19:32,250 --> 01:19:34,330
Is this really part of the murder mystery game?

1214
01:19:34,350 --> 01:19:36,810
Or is there something deeper happening?

1215
01:19:37,910 --> 01:19:41,770
I need more evidence to figure out what's going on.

1216
01:19:44,650 --> 01:19:46,350
Can, okay, it's my job.

1217
01:19:46,630 --> 01:19:47,830
Okay, wait, yeah.

1218
01:19:48,510 --> 01:19:50,450
I'm gonna let him know it's my job, so he'll tip me.

1219
01:19:50,830 --> 01:19:53,830
It's my job to keep an eye on you.

1220
01:19:54,870 --> 01:19:58,490
The train rules say I gotta stay and watch after everyone.

1221
01:20:00,410 --> 01:20:02,470
You just won't hang out with me.

1222
01:20:02,750 --> 01:20:04,270
You just wanna hang out with me.

1223
01:20:04,350 --> 01:20:05,390
don't you?

1224
01:20:06,130 --> 01:20:07,910
I can see it in your eyes.

1225
01:20:08,310 --> 01:20:10,190
I mean, you picked me over Amy.

1226
01:20:11,830 --> 01:20:14,150
How is everyone great at reading people, but me?

1227
01:20:15,270 --> 01:20:22,330
As I said, the best detectives have sidekicks, so I'm happy
to have you.

1228
01:20:24,070 --> 01:20:29,890
If you ever catch me looking glum, though, just know it's
because, uh, where's my lawyer card?

1229
01:20:31,290 --> 01:20:32,050
Oh my god.

1230
01:20:32,650 --> 01:20:40,830
The last guy to work The last guy to work a case with me
ditched our practice to join the evil Dr. Igman.

1231
01:20:41,750 --> 01:20:44,610
Not a proper detective without baggage.

1232
01:20:46,090 --> 01:20:46,950
This is true.

1233
01:20:48,370 --> 01:20:49,670
Yeah, oh shit, okay.

1234
01:20:51,330 --> 01:20:56,050
Guys, I need you guys to know I can't do accents, like,
especially country.

1235
01:21:01,190 --> 01:21:02,510
Hmm, okay, wait.

1236
01:21:05,290 --> 01:21:19,430
varmits what what are y'all doing in my saloon i'm sorry i
can't see country access what are you doing all listen what

1237
01:21:19,430 --> 01:21:31,150
are y'all doing in my saloon he's trying so hard to stay in
character knuckles we're trying to figure out who murdered

1238
01:21:31,150 --> 01:21:50,730
sonic i can I can see that Amy mosey threw and told me all
about it Enough of that Oh thank God, okay, enough of that

1239
01:21:51,670 --> 01:22:00,570
Wonder how long he kept that voice up for Amy Well you're
wondering if you could tell us what you were up to before

1240
01:22:00,570 --> 01:22:12,390
the murder Anything to help us establish your alibi and nope
i have nothing to tell either of you leave me alone he's

1241
01:22:12,390 --> 01:22:14,790
sweating he's sweating

1242
01:22:18,910 --> 01:22:29,710
analysis he's obviously agitated about something but why
take it out on us it's him he's the murderer amy was the red

1243
01:22:29,710 --> 01:22:34,710
herring he's the actual murderer i know better than to argue
and Knuckles.

1244
01:22:35,410 --> 01:22:37,590
So it seems we're on our own.

1245
01:22:38,470 --> 01:22:40,190
Doki Meido, FPS VTube.

1246
01:22:41,110 --> 01:22:44,930
We need to figure out what Knuckles was up to while we were
all apart.

1247
01:22:47,230 --> 01:22:51,690
Let's investigate for clues and then interrogate.

1248
01:22:52,890 --> 01:22:53,170
Right!

1249
01:22:53,430 --> 01:22:54,310
Let's do it!

1250
01:22:54,650 --> 01:22:58,490
Okay, he's obviously he played video games and then smashed
it.

1251
01:22:58,990 --> 01:23:01,770
Clearly won't be able to give the game Super Monkey Ball a
try.

1252
01:23:04,350 --> 01:23:07,470
We think it broke when the train sped up.

1253
01:23:08,070 --> 01:23:12,190
The damages look more to be caused from punches.

1254
01:23:13,330 --> 01:23:13,830
Who could have...

1255
01:23:13,830 --> 01:23:14,670
Oh, I wonder who.

1256
01:23:15,690 --> 01:23:19,130
Could it be the Enkidna that has a name...

1257
01:23:19,130 --> 01:23:21,650
Whose name is based on his fucking hands?

1258
01:23:22,150 --> 01:23:22,850
No.

1259
01:23:24,510 --> 01:23:27,570
Whose entire fucking superpower is punching?

1260
01:23:28,230 --> 01:23:28,810
No.

1261
01:23:29,710 --> 01:23:30,230
No.

1262
01:23:34,570 --> 01:23:36,810
Nah, probably not.

1263
01:23:37,490 --> 01:23:39,750
What are you two looking at me for?

1264
01:23:41,270 --> 01:23:44,730
Smash arcade is added to your inventory.

1265
01:23:46,270 --> 01:23:48,470
No fucking way.

1266
01:23:50,990 --> 01:23:53,090
No fucking way.

1267
01:23:54,730 --> 01:23:56,570
Alright, let's talk to the head.

1268
01:23:57,490 --> 01:23:59,650
The robotic arms here are really helpful.

1269
01:24:07,090 --> 01:24:17,890
what's the arm doing to my hair he fixed it up a bit that's
incredible what interesting tech uh oh should i fear for my

1270
01:24:17,890 --> 01:24:28,390
job a little bit how well can it microwave what's this
decent cash reward for finding this robot maybe i'll keep an

1271
01:24:28,390 --> 01:24:31,770
eye out Poor Omochow.

1272
01:24:32,350 --> 01:24:33,690
Hate to see them like this.

1273
01:24:34,250 --> 01:24:35,210
What do they do?

1274
01:24:35,990 --> 01:24:36,970
Medical mount?

1275
01:24:37,330 --> 01:24:37,330
What?

1276
01:24:39,030 --> 01:24:39,530
Interesting.

1277
01:24:40,170 --> 01:24:41,610
Wait, what the fuck did they do?

1278
01:24:42,230 --> 01:24:43,530
What the fuck?

1279
01:24:44,530 --> 01:24:44,930
Alright.

1280
01:24:45,610 --> 01:24:45,610
Oh.

1281
01:24:46,230 --> 01:24:48,010
Dokimido FPS VTube.

1282
01:24:48,610 --> 01:24:49,910
This is interesting.

1283
01:24:51,830 --> 01:24:52,490
What is?

1284
01:24:52,570 --> 01:24:53,970
It's just a few used cups.

1285
01:24:56,010 --> 01:24:57,270
But why are there three?

1286
01:24:57,350 --> 01:24:59,550
Oh god.

1287
01:24:59,650 --> 01:25:03,850
You know what they say about a kidness.

1288
01:25:07,470 --> 01:25:09,970
Um, Knuckles was really thirsty.

1289
01:25:13,590 --> 01:25:15,710
Doki made our FPS VTube.

1290
01:25:16,210 --> 01:25:18,890
This one has a lipstick on the rim.

1291
01:25:21,390 --> 01:25:23,970
That's not Knuckles' color at all!

1292
01:25:24,790 --> 01:25:26,290
Wait, where's lipstick?

1293
01:25:27,790 --> 01:25:29,270
Someone else.

1294
01:25:29,650 --> 01:25:30,970
Must have been here.

1295
01:25:32,030 --> 01:25:33,670
We should log this.

1296
01:25:35,370 --> 01:25:36,810
Oh, knuckles!

1297
01:25:37,610 --> 01:25:40,110
You slide, dog.

1298
01:25:40,990 --> 01:25:43,050
I think we have enough clues.

1299
01:25:43,590 --> 01:25:44,110
Knuckles!

1300
01:25:45,890 --> 01:25:49,290
What are you doing with Rouge the cat?

1301
01:25:49,410 --> 01:25:49,750
Oh, wait, no.

1302
01:25:50,030 --> 01:25:50,890
Wait, Rouge the bat.

1303
01:25:51,930 --> 01:25:52,290
What?

1304
01:25:53,850 --> 01:25:55,130
Like, bat cat.

1305
01:25:55,250 --> 01:25:56,030
Same thing.

1306
01:25:56,290 --> 01:25:57,490
One can...

1307
01:25:57,490 --> 01:25:59,490
Bats are basically flying cats.

1308
01:26:03,570 --> 01:26:06,150
I thought I told you, leave me alone.

1309
01:26:08,010 --> 01:26:08,870
I like your hat.

1310
01:26:09,970 --> 01:26:10,630
Oh!

1311
01:26:11,750 --> 01:26:14,450
Guys, I'm getting better at risen, people.

1312
01:26:16,870 --> 01:26:18,470
I told you, chat.

1313
01:26:19,470 --> 01:26:22,010
I told you I'm getting better at risen.

1314
01:26:25,230 --> 01:26:25,950
Knuckles.

1315
01:26:26,910 --> 01:26:28,290
Are you blushing?

1316
01:26:31,710 --> 01:26:34,470
I said, leave me alone.

1317
01:26:36,410 --> 01:26:41,050
It doesn't look like he's used to being complimented.

1318
01:26:41,490 --> 01:26:42,810
Uh, Josie, thank you for the super chat.

1319
01:26:42,870 --> 01:26:43,490
Thank you.

1320
01:26:43,570 --> 01:26:47,090
I can't believe Doki murdered Sonic for his passport.

1321
01:26:48,390 --> 01:26:54,050
Did you just adjust your hat a bit so we could see it
better?

1322
01:26:56,370 --> 01:26:58,090
I said, leave.

1323
01:27:00,150 --> 01:27:01,750
All right, can I take your order?

1324
01:27:02,650 --> 01:27:04,110
Hmm, not hungry.

1325
01:27:04,950 --> 01:27:07,390
Well, you're alright, just let me know, won't you?

1326
01:27:07,610 --> 01:27:10,610
Don't tell the robot, I want to keep my job.

1327
01:27:11,130 --> 01:27:14,010
Sure, like a butler of sorts, right?

1328
01:27:14,870 --> 01:27:17,270
Come on, Doki Mado, FPS V2.

1329
01:27:17,770 --> 01:27:19,010
You're not a butler.

1330
01:27:19,530 --> 01:27:20,390
Tell him that.

1331
01:27:21,330 --> 01:27:25,030
Yeah, like a butler, because I'm a little bitch.

1332
01:27:26,290 --> 01:27:28,410
Excellent, thank you, butler.

1333
01:27:29,650 --> 01:27:30,190
Dang it.

1334
01:27:31,570 --> 01:27:31,970
Oh, shit.

1335
01:27:32,130 --> 01:27:33,370
Wait, he doesn't want to talk to me.

1336
01:27:34,770 --> 01:27:34,990
All right.

1337
01:27:35,090 --> 01:27:36,670
Start the interrogation.

1338
01:27:37,790 --> 01:27:38,310
Obtraction.

1339
01:27:39,550 --> 01:27:40,030
Knuckles.

1340
01:27:40,650 --> 01:27:42,850
Doki made a FPS V-tube.

1341
01:27:43,290 --> 01:27:48,190
And I need to determine what you were doing during the hour
the murder took place.

1342
01:27:49,310 --> 01:27:50,130
I already told you.

1343
01:27:50,470 --> 01:27:51,290
Buzz off.

1344
01:27:51,790 --> 01:27:53,710
You're not getting anything out of me.

1345
01:27:55,310 --> 01:27:56,010
Thank you, Philly.

1346
01:27:56,270 --> 01:27:57,270
We don't need to say much.

1347
01:27:57,670 --> 01:27:59,210
What happened here is pretty obvious.

1348
01:28:03,130 --> 01:28:04,410
It is.

1349
01:28:05,630 --> 01:28:07,150
We have evidence too.

1350
01:28:08,230 --> 01:28:08,890
We do.

1351
01:28:10,210 --> 01:28:11,790
Jokey Mado, FPS VTube.

1352
01:28:12,330 --> 01:28:14,630
Just take a good look at our inventory.

1353
01:28:15,810 --> 01:28:17,670
I hope we're going to grab more evidence.

1354
01:28:18,170 --> 01:28:22,650
Because having two evidence tells the entire story.

1355
01:28:23,250 --> 01:28:24,530
And like, I literally just need a...

1356
01:28:24,530 --> 01:28:27,670
It's like a 50-50 on the order of the evidence.

1357
01:28:27,670 --> 01:28:33,630
What was distracting Knuckles during the time Sonic was
murdered?

1358
01:28:34,990 --> 01:28:36,210
His little date.

1359
01:28:37,190 --> 01:28:37,710
Yeah.

1360
01:28:39,550 --> 01:28:40,470
Wait, what?

1361
01:28:41,150 --> 01:28:42,550
Oh, wrong choice.

1362
01:28:42,750 --> 01:28:44,170
Doki made up FPS VTube.

1363
01:28:44,630 --> 01:28:45,470
Let's try again.

1364
01:28:45,750 --> 01:28:47,710
Wait, I lost the 50-50, guys.

1365
01:28:50,470 --> 01:28:51,650
Just like Doki Day.

1366
01:28:52,030 --> 01:28:53,310
I lost the 50-50.

1367
01:28:53,830 --> 01:28:55,370
Okay, the smashed arcade.

1368
01:28:57,810 --> 01:29:06,750
The arcade machine What makes you think I touched it think
oh no, okay.

1369
01:29:07,410 --> 01:29:07,850
Okay, it's guys.

1370
01:29:08,070 --> 01:29:08,390
I'm thinking

1371
01:29:11,990 --> 01:29:25,070
I'm thinking God I'm thinking so hard right now Oh my god,
you can see my brain Nice I did it As long as I don't send

1372
01:29:25,070 --> 01:29:25,730
any spikes.

1373
01:29:26,110 --> 01:29:27,650
Oh my god, where's the fucking light?

1374
01:29:27,670 --> 01:29:28,070
bub.

1375
01:29:28,470 --> 01:29:29,190
I did it!

1376
01:29:30,010 --> 01:29:30,650
I think!

1377
01:29:33,330 --> 01:29:35,770
This isn't a tough one, Knuckles.

1378
01:29:36,730 --> 01:29:43,070
Knuckles, you clearly touched the arcade machine because the
arcade...

1379
01:29:43,070 --> 01:29:45,430
Okay, your hair was viled at the scene.

1380
01:29:45,510 --> 01:29:46,770
Okay, wait, I want to see this.

1381
01:29:47,250 --> 01:29:48,170
You mean fur?

1382
01:29:49,250 --> 01:29:50,790
Fur, you mean spines?

1383
01:29:52,050 --> 01:29:54,970
Doesn't matter because it seems I'm wrong here.

1384
01:29:55,430 --> 01:30:01,270
Knuckles, you clearly touched the arcade machine because the
arcade cabinet is covered in punches.

1385
01:30:01,770 --> 01:30:02,570
Take that.

1386
01:30:04,350 --> 01:30:08,470
What evidence do you have that the damage is our punches?

1387
01:30:09,530 --> 01:30:09,690
Hmm.

1388
01:30:11,130 --> 01:30:11,650
Hmm.

1389
01:30:13,250 --> 01:30:15,330
What are y'all staring at my hands for?

1390
01:30:16,270 --> 01:30:18,310
My nipple hand.

1391
01:30:19,750 --> 01:30:30,750
Do you guys know that famous, like, Sonic the Hedgehog comic
regarding Knuckles' like, hands and then the the creator of

1392
01:30:30,750 --> 01:30:38,130
that Sonic comic became like an official artist for the
official Sonic comics did you guys know

1393
01:30:41,610 --> 01:30:52,570
do you guys know that a little fun fact for you um I don't
think the official Sonic channel would like vouch for me

1394
01:30:52,570 --> 01:31:01,370
though knuckles You clearly destroyed the arcade machine,
but why?

1395
01:31:03,210 --> 01:31:07,030
I needed a punching bag, and none were available to me.

1396
01:31:08,590 --> 01:31:10,650
Just a sudden urge to punch?

1397
01:31:12,090 --> 01:31:13,310
I vouch!

1398
01:31:14,170 --> 01:31:14,550
See?

1399
01:31:15,190 --> 01:31:15,650
What?

1400
01:31:15,790 --> 01:31:17,650
I told you, it was real.

1401
01:31:18,270 --> 01:31:19,930
He vouches.

1402
01:31:20,030 --> 01:31:20,850
It's real!

1403
01:31:23,150 --> 01:31:27,330
I believe repairing the arcade machine will give us our ass.

1404
01:31:27,350 --> 01:31:39,810
answer how would you i'm on it toky made on fps v tube

1407
01:32:05,190 --> 01:32:20,930

1408

okay what does that oh my gosh by one point oh my god noob
wait is that oh okay it says bread okay okay what does this

1409
01:32:35,650 --> 01:32:46,590
tell us nothing obviously it tells us something massive look
at the name at the top of the list it's vector it's supposed

1410
01:32:46,590 --> 01:32:53,870
to be in the library like he's like hey do you remember
where vector is do you remember if you don't remember don't

1411
01:32:53,870 --> 01:33:00,010
worry it's in bolded red letters it's supposed to be in the
library car.

1412
01:33:01,530 --> 01:33:03,290
You just got Vectored.

1413
01:33:03,290 --> 01:33:03,970
Oh yeah.

1414
01:33:06,270 --> 01:33:09,090
The picture is beginning to be painted here.

1415
01:33:09,590 --> 01:33:12,370
You compete with Vector to see who could get the highest
score.

1416
01:33:13,470 --> 01:33:15,250
And Vector beat you!

1417
01:33:18,510 --> 01:33:23,290
And in frustration, you destroy the arcade cabinet!

1418
01:33:24,430 --> 01:33:24,970
Ah!

1419
01:33:27,350 --> 01:33:29,130
He's punching the air in frustration.

1420
01:33:30,790 --> 01:33:31,490
You're guessing.

1421
01:33:32,090 --> 01:33:33,030
Where's your proof?

1422
01:33:33,690 --> 01:33:35,310
Where's your evidence?

1423
01:33:36,450 --> 01:33:38,270
Vector's a common name.

1424
01:33:39,090 --> 01:33:40,350
Prove to me he was here.

1425
01:33:41,050 --> 01:33:41,550
Now!

1426
01:33:43,290 --> 01:33:44,430
Okay, I'm thinking.

1427
01:33:45,130 --> 01:33:45,670
I don't know.

1428
01:33:45,790 --> 01:33:46,910
There's like, wait, but who's...

1429
01:33:46,910 --> 01:33:48,430
I guess it was like Rouge, Vector.

1430
01:33:48,630 --> 01:33:51,170
Oh my god, they're not playing the game.

1431
01:33:51,390 --> 01:33:51,910
Seriously!

1432
01:33:52,930 --> 01:33:54,710
It's Amy's birthday!

1433
01:33:55,610 --> 01:33:57,090
Why are they not taking care?

1434
01:33:57,350 --> 01:33:58,610
Oh shit, I'm sorry, I got distracted.

1435
01:33:58,730 --> 01:34:00,310
Why are they not taking her birthday?

1436
01:34:00,850 --> 01:34:01,350
Seriously?

1437
01:34:03,490 --> 01:34:05,850
Okay, I just barely made it.

1438
01:34:06,050 --> 01:34:06,570
Holy fuck.

1439
01:34:06,690 --> 01:34:08,430
Maybe I should put on journalist mode.

1440
01:34:13,390 --> 01:34:16,010
Now, Dorky made a FPS V-tube.

1441
01:34:16,870 --> 01:34:19,550
What proves Vector was here with knuckles?

1442
01:34:20,610 --> 01:34:22,010
Okay, I mean, my...

1443
01:34:22,010 --> 01:34:23,490
I have two evidence.

1444
01:34:23,670 --> 01:34:25,670
Like, what would my other evidence be?

1445
01:34:25,830 --> 01:34:27,070
It's process of elimination.

1446
01:34:29,090 --> 01:34:29,610
No!

1447
01:34:29,770 --> 01:34:32,470
I thought it was strange.

1448
01:34:32,650 --> 01:34:34,910
There was more than one cup sitting next to you.

1449
01:34:35,730 --> 01:34:40,390
Wow, you were supposed to be participating in the murder
mystery game for Amy's birthday.

1450
01:34:42,610 --> 01:34:46,830
You and Vector enjoyed some drinks playing arcade.

1451
01:34:50,470 --> 01:34:52,630
It's not like...

1452
01:34:52,630 --> 01:34:53,230
It's not.

1453
01:34:53,350 --> 01:34:54,250
I wasn't.

1454
01:34:54,490 --> 01:34:56,250
There was a woman there too.

1455
01:34:57,810 --> 01:34:59,650
Don't tell Amy.

1456
01:34:59,770 --> 01:35:03,850
I think we're on the right track here.

1457
01:35:04,750 --> 01:35:13,870
It's, as you say, Vector popped in at the top of the hour,
wanting to play the arcade machine with me.

1458
01:35:14,870 --> 01:35:18,670
We went back and forth, trying to figure the game out.

1459
01:35:19,190 --> 01:35:22,830
But when we did, we competed for the high score.

1460
01:35:23,750 --> 01:35:27,270
When he defeated me, I destroyed the machine.

1461
01:35:28,070 --> 01:35:29,750
No proof of his work.

1462
01:35:29,770 --> 01:35:45,110
win jesus christ man i was trying to fix the arcade cabinet
before you two came in honest i didn't want to be caught and

1463
01:35:45,110 --> 01:35:54,370
that's my story an alibi i've already told an abridged
version of this wait then why okay if he told this version

1464
01:35:54,370 --> 01:35:59,310
to amy why didn't he tell us like he already got caught
Knuckles, you're just fucking stupid.

1465
01:35:59,430 --> 01:36:00,230
You already got caught!

1466
01:36:00,390 --> 01:36:02,610
Why were you, like, trying to hide it?

1467
01:36:04,970 --> 01:36:10,070
Bro, this friend group has a lot of pride issues.

1468
01:36:10,290 --> 01:36:12,830
I mean, there's a lot of issues in Sonic the fandom.

1469
01:36:13,890 --> 01:36:16,330
That explains one of the used cups.

1470
01:36:18,750 --> 01:36:21,410
But what is a cup with a lipstick mark?

1471
01:36:23,350 --> 01:36:27,510
I don't want people to know that there was a woman here,
too.

1472
01:36:28,470 --> 01:36:33,110
wish was in here too never mind i'm okay with saying it

1473
01:36:41,150 --> 01:36:53,910
it's inconsequential not worth mentioning so you searched
around for something but failed made fun of our game and

1474
01:36:53,910 --> 01:37:05,930
left I'm nauseous that one But you offered a drink
apparently Listen I don't know why she showed up And I told

1475
01:37:05,930 --> 01:37:10,330
you everything that happened before the train sped up Are
you not satisfied?

1476
01:37:10,890 --> 01:37:12,050
Will you two relent?

1477
01:37:13,570 --> 01:37:21,470
Hmm I'm understanding the scenario Vector visited to play
games Rouge couldn't find something and left Dead Knuckles

1478
01:37:21,470 --> 01:37:27,490
destroyed the machine That all makes sense to me Thank you
for answering so many of our questions.

1479
01:37:28,410 --> 01:37:32,450
Actually, actually, that's not everything.

1480
01:37:34,030 --> 01:37:34,930
Is it knuckless?

1481
01:37:35,110 --> 01:37:35,810
Wait, there's more?

1482
01:37:36,650 --> 01:37:38,170
He's clearly innocent.

1483
01:37:39,330 --> 01:37:39,610
Huh?

1484
01:37:41,670 --> 01:37:42,370
Hmm?

1485
01:37:43,690 --> 01:37:44,570
He's sweating.

1486
01:37:44,670 --> 01:37:45,470
Wait, there is more.

1487
01:37:46,450 --> 01:37:49,110
I want to step back to something I noticed.

1488
01:37:49,990 --> 01:37:52,470
One more name on the highest score list.

1489
01:37:53,150 --> 01:37:54,690
Doesn't make sense.

1490
01:37:54,710 --> 01:37:55,790
Wait, what?

1491
01:37:56,430 --> 01:37:57,670
I just remember bread.

1492
01:37:59,070 --> 01:38:00,490
Talking Mado FPS VTube.

1493
01:38:01,110 --> 01:38:03,170
Can you take a look one more time?

1494
01:38:04,330 --> 01:38:06,570
An odd name on the high score list.

1495
01:38:07,210 --> 01:38:09,170
What is Tails talking about?

1496
01:38:09,670 --> 01:38:10,370
There's more?

1497
01:38:14,800 --> 01:38:15,360
Ultim?

1498
01:38:17,700 --> 01:38:18,520
What is Ultim?

1499
01:38:19,800 --> 01:38:20,640
Is it Ultim?

1500
01:38:22,440 --> 01:38:23,980
Because all of this is food.

1501
01:38:24,280 --> 01:38:25,360
And then there's Ultim.

1502
01:38:25,980 --> 01:38:26,540
Ultimate?

1503
01:38:27,640 --> 01:38:42,180
all the name yeah all the other names have food theme but
this one who here goes by ultim what the fuck is ultim you

1504
01:38:42,180 --> 01:38:54,740
may not know yokey made a FPS vtube but there is someone
here that goes by that title the ultimate life form oh oh

1505
01:38:58,120 --> 01:39:12,080
oh um truly the most edgy one out there

1506
01:39:16,960 --> 01:39:24,100
there's really someone here that i told you i look see i'm
i'm just trying to be immersive chat i'm just i'm just

1507
01:39:24,100 --> 01:39:30,640
trying to be immersive okay playing as my Sonic OC.

1508
01:39:31,540 --> 01:39:33,480
There's really someone here that goes by that.

1509
01:39:33,900 --> 01:39:34,880
Also, he's fucking...

1510
01:39:34,880 --> 01:39:36,040
Bro, you can't...

1511
01:39:36,040 --> 01:39:39,260
How are you in the ultimate life form when you suck at video
games?

1512
01:39:40,360 --> 01:39:42,820
Nothing sneaks by you, doesn't bud.

1513
01:39:43,660 --> 01:39:50,220
Vector and I were struggling so much with the game, but then
Shadow dropped by.

1514
01:39:51,500 --> 01:39:53,320
So, Shadow was here too?

1515
01:39:53,620 --> 01:39:57,100
We're not taking seriously of Amy's fucking birthday party!

1516
01:39:57,720 --> 01:39:59,060
What are you doing outside of...

1517
01:39:59,080 --> 01:40:09,900
your cards he taught us to gain and was the first to get his
name on the scoreboard vector and i then fought to be shadow

1518
01:40:09,900 --> 01:40:21,360
score they're both very annoying he only neatly had to
compete huh he gave me this before he left what did he give

1519
01:40:21,360 --> 01:40:31,060
a key where did shadow go to what was shadow's cart shadow
told me to lock the door I did not open it for anyone.

1520
01:40:32,020 --> 01:40:33,240
Then, he left.

1521
01:40:34,940 --> 01:40:37,920
When Vector was leaving, I locked the door behind him.

1522
01:40:38,440 --> 01:40:40,580
Saw no one else after locking the door.

1523
01:40:41,260 --> 01:40:42,280
That is pretty sus.

1524
01:40:42,760 --> 01:40:43,520
He did it.

1525
01:40:43,860 --> 01:40:45,520
Knuckles and Amy were the red heron.

1526
01:40:45,960 --> 01:40:47,020
It was shadow.

1527
01:40:48,560 --> 01:40:50,840
That's the honest truth.

1528
01:40:53,420 --> 01:40:58,900
So when Amy came through here, not too long ago, did you
open the door for her?

1529
01:40:59,580 --> 01:41:01,300
The shadow, I knew it!

1530
01:41:01,660 --> 01:41:03,100
I knew it was to the shadow!

1531
01:41:04,080 --> 01:41:07,180
No, I think she has some sort of key too.

1532
01:41:09,560 --> 01:41:10,080
That's right.

1533
01:41:10,380 --> 01:41:13,200
The conductor gave her that special birthday key.

1534
01:41:16,240 --> 01:41:19,400
Well, I have a lot of questions.

1535
01:41:20,780 --> 01:41:23,500
What happened in the library to cause Vector to come here?

1536
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:27,020
Why is shadow locked in doors?

1537
01:41:27,540 --> 01:41:29,040
And what was Rouge searching for?

1538
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:43,500
I don't know They didn't tell me Even though I asked with
that Cowboy accent Y'all You're gonna have to find them And

1539
01:41:43,500 --> 01:41:58,220
ask them yourself We did it We fucking did it We solved the
mystery That is not chat No sorry not not knuckles As of

1540
01:41:58,220 --> 01:42:00,460
right now I believe your story, Knuckles.

1541
01:42:01,100 --> 01:42:04,320
We'll only know for sure when we confirm things with Vector.

1542
01:42:05,520 --> 01:42:06,180
Fair enough.

1543
01:42:06,920 --> 01:42:08,680
The library is in the next car.

1544
01:42:09,340 --> 01:42:11,180
I'll open the lock for you.

1545
01:42:12,520 --> 01:42:17,360
Give whatever KO'd Sonic an earful for me, Detective Tails
and Butler.

1546
01:42:18,620 --> 01:42:21,280
I liked it better when he wasn't talking to us.

1547
01:42:22,600 --> 01:42:24,200
Well, do, Sheriff.

1548
01:42:25,100 --> 01:42:27,200
Come on, dokey made our FPS V-Tube.

1549
01:42:27,640 --> 01:42:29,060
Let's head to the library, Bunch.

1550
01:42:29,080 --> 01:42:33,360
But we got to knock first so they can, you know, at least
we're interrupting anything.

1551
01:42:34,440 --> 01:42:37,680
This is way more exciting than microwaving chili dogs.

1552
01:42:38,480 --> 01:42:40,220
Joki Mado FPS VTuber!

1553
01:42:41,700 --> 01:42:42,160
Coming!

1554
01:42:43,400 --> 01:42:44,980
Alright, let's go.

1555
01:42:45,380 --> 01:42:46,100
Knock, knock.

1556
01:42:47,040 --> 01:42:49,880
Ready to mosey down on the next car.

1557
01:42:50,180 --> 01:42:50,640
Oh, wait.

1558
01:42:51,740 --> 01:42:53,020
There's something in the trash can?

1559
01:42:53,620 --> 01:42:54,960
Okay, what's in the trash can?

1560
01:42:55,420 --> 01:42:57,140
Something's always hidden in the trash.

1561
01:42:57,600 --> 01:42:58,660
Let's check there.

1562
01:42:59,740 --> 01:43:02,120
Sadly, this one's empty as well.

1563
01:43:02,640 --> 01:43:02,800
Liars!

1564
01:43:05,280 --> 01:43:07,160
It's only a matter of time, Tails.

1565
01:43:07,420 --> 01:43:08,000
Have faith.

1566
01:43:08,360 --> 01:43:09,080
You're liars!

1567
01:43:09,160 --> 01:43:10,780
There was nothing in the trash can!

1568
01:43:12,500 --> 01:43:13,680
It's as they say.

1569
01:43:14,620 --> 01:43:17,660
One man's trash is another man's treasure.

1570
01:43:18,480 --> 01:43:19,020
Ha ha!

1571
01:43:19,360 --> 01:43:21,420
I think Tails is ignoring me.

1572
01:43:22,080 --> 01:43:22,900
Wait, trust.

1573
01:43:24,460 --> 01:43:24,900
Okay.

1574
01:43:25,600 --> 01:43:27,440
It's only... Alright, we're gonna keep pressing.

1575
01:43:28,700 --> 01:43:29,620
It's It's empty!

1576
01:43:29,840 --> 01:43:30,820
What do you mean?

1577
01:43:33,060 --> 01:43:34,700
It's still empty!

1578
01:43:36,640 --> 01:43:38,200
Wait, is there an extra trash can?

1579
01:43:38,300 --> 01:43:38,660
No!

1580
01:43:40,100 --> 01:43:41,320
This one's empty!

1581
01:43:41,660 --> 01:43:42,900
Trust the system?

1582
01:43:44,100 --> 01:43:47,440
Okay, how many times do I have to press the fucking trash
can?

1583
01:43:48,840 --> 01:43:50,820
Oh, they mean the next car.

1584
01:43:51,100 --> 01:43:51,400
Okay.

1585
01:43:54,580 --> 01:43:57,020
Alright, you got it, partner.

1586
01:43:59,360 --> 01:44:01,080
Here we go.

1587
01:44:03,260 --> 01:44:03,860
Onwards!

1588
01:44:09,240 --> 01:44:10,440
Whoa, the library.

1589
01:44:10,560 --> 01:44:11,340
Hang in there.

1590
01:44:12,320 --> 01:44:13,320
The library car.

1591
01:44:14,020 --> 01:44:15,860
This is a big ass fucking car.

1592
01:44:17,240 --> 01:44:20,260
This does not feel accurate to like the saloon back then.

1593
01:44:20,320 --> 01:44:21,940
This is wider than the saloon.

1594
01:44:23,840 --> 01:44:25,300
All this stuff's getting heavy.

1595
01:44:25,600 --> 01:44:27,180
I'll dump what I don't need.

1596
01:44:28,660 --> 01:44:30,960
Everyone's favorite journalist reporter!

1597
01:44:32,080 --> 01:44:35,300
Amy Rose is hot on the scoop.

1598
01:44:36,940 --> 01:44:37,960
I'm heading out.

1599
01:44:38,460 --> 01:44:41,280
You've been fabulously helpful.

1600
01:44:44,280 --> 01:44:49,160
Before you go, Espionage wanted to give you your presents.

1601
01:44:50,560 --> 01:44:51,400
My presents?

1602
01:44:52,280 --> 01:44:54,100
You're both too sweet.

1603
01:44:54,660 --> 01:44:55,660
Thank you.

1604
01:44:57,200 --> 01:45:00,800
Victor, it seems we have more guests.

1605
01:45:05,080 --> 01:45:16,780
company Amy there you are are you only found any leads yet
no she doesn't have to join us it's okay she doesn't have to

1606
01:45:16,780 --> 01:45:26,140
join us we don't want too many cooks in the kitchen oh the
detective pair needs help from the birthday this is exactly

1607
01:45:26,140 --> 01:45:28,420
why you're not joining us Amy this is

1608
01:45:32,920 --> 01:45:36,680
She knows everyone's allowed to be the sassy on their
birthday.

1609
01:45:39,320 --> 01:45:41,820
This tip is just too juicy to ignore.

1610
01:45:42,420 --> 01:45:43,520
I'll see you all around.

1611
01:45:45,500 --> 01:45:46,460
Don't worry, Sonic.

1612
01:45:46,980 --> 01:45:49,700
I'll be the one to avenge you and quick.

1613
01:45:51,680 --> 01:45:53,280
But how are you going to leave?

1614
01:45:53,800 --> 01:45:55,640
The door to the next car is locked.

1615
01:45:57,240 --> 01:45:59,000
You doubt the birthday, girl?

1616
01:46:00,260 --> 01:46:02,060
I have the journey.

1617
01:46:02,080 --> 01:46:03,360
Journalist mode key.

1618
01:46:06,040 --> 01:46:07,080
Right, right.

1619
01:46:07,460 --> 01:46:10,340
The birthday girl gets journalist mode.

1620
01:46:11,780 --> 01:46:12,240
Of course.

1621
01:46:13,020 --> 01:46:14,700
It's a birthday privilege.

1622
01:46:17,820 --> 01:46:21,720
I'll solve the case before anyone else.

1623
01:46:22,460 --> 01:46:22,800
Bye.

1624
01:46:25,870 --> 01:46:29,430
Amy may be hasty, but she's thorough.

1625
01:46:31,070 --> 01:46:33,190
Now, what are you two doing here?

1626
01:46:34,170 --> 01:46:36,510
Look, mighty suspicious, I say.

1627
01:46:37,090 --> 01:46:42,230
Wait, does that mean, like, the key that Knuckles has only
works for, like, one car?

1628
01:46:42,870 --> 01:46:44,790
So, like, oh, because it's not the master key.

1629
01:46:44,910 --> 01:46:45,390
It's, like, in the...

1630
01:46:45,390 --> 01:46:47,290
Wait, did how did Shadow get the fucking...

1631
01:46:47,290 --> 01:46:48,990
I fucking knew it was Shadow.

1632
01:46:52,010 --> 01:46:55,030
How the fuck did Shadow grab the saloon car key?

1633
01:46:58,730 --> 01:46:59,690
I'm the detective.

1634
01:47:00,390 --> 01:47:02,050
And so I can't be the murderer.

1635
01:47:02,110 --> 01:47:02,930
I knew it was Tails.

1636
01:47:03,070 --> 01:47:03,510
I knew it.

1637
01:47:05,490 --> 01:47:10,250
Uh, Vector, Knuckles, Shadow, and Amy were Red Herons.

1638
01:47:10,410 --> 01:47:10,790
I knew it.

1639
01:47:10,870 --> 01:47:11,890
It was Tails all along.

1640
01:47:13,650 --> 01:47:15,650
And I'm, uh...

1641
01:47:15,650 --> 01:47:16,790
Oh, he's a locksmith!

1642
01:47:16,970 --> 01:47:19,150
I forgot he's the locksmith.

1643
01:47:20,330 --> 01:47:21,310
Oh, yeah.

1644
01:47:21,450 --> 01:47:22,510
He had a job.

1645
01:47:22,730 --> 01:47:23,090
Sorry.

1646
01:47:23,510 --> 01:47:25,630
The ultimate life form actually has it.

1647
01:47:25,770 --> 01:47:30,410
Imagine being the ultimate life form and still having a job,
having to get a job.

1648
01:47:31,230 --> 01:47:33,490
Um, I'm here to ask if anybody's hungry.

1649
01:47:34,830 --> 01:47:35,390
Starm!

1650
01:47:35,490 --> 01:47:39,930
I'll kill you for a chicken Parmesan right about now.

1651
01:47:40,930 --> 01:47:43,450
Maybe kill isn't the right language to use right now.

1652
01:47:44,110 --> 01:47:44,690
Sonic's dead.

1653
01:47:46,470 --> 01:47:47,750
I'm Vector the Butcher.

1654
01:47:48,650 --> 01:47:51,150
I'm licensed to handle raw meat.

1655
01:47:52,610 --> 01:47:54,090
That's right.

1656
01:47:57,130 --> 01:48:00,230
And I'm Espio the Poet.

1657
01:48:04,390 --> 01:48:04,710
Ah.

1658
01:48:05,930 --> 01:48:18,930
A resident message from poet to reader meant to challenge
our delicate perspective with the most arithmetic of poise.

1659
01:48:19,690 --> 01:48:20,930
Fucking nerd!

1660
01:48:23,990 --> 01:48:25,230
Can I hear some?

1661
01:48:27,210 --> 01:48:27,490
Sure.

1662
01:48:28,210 --> 01:48:31,250
Oh my god, he's a poser.

1663
01:48:32,510 --> 01:48:33,750
Teardrops in the spring.

1664
01:48:34,790 --> 01:48:35,430
Can you hear me?

1665
01:48:35,490 --> 01:48:36,090
sing?

1666
01:48:37,070 --> 01:48:51,170
La la la la dee dee dee Oh my god, that was so beautiful
That was so beautiful, guys Oh my god Beautiful Was that it?

1667
01:48:52,130 --> 01:49:04,530
I have more of you like Cherry blossoms In the spring I'm
not Satisfied now, thanks I can't believe it, why did you

1668
01:49:04,530 --> 01:49:05,370
interrupt him?

1669
01:49:05,490 --> 01:49:06,930
It was going so well.

1670
01:49:10,730 --> 01:49:13,190
At least he's rhyming, I suppose.

1671
01:49:13,830 --> 01:49:14,810
I'll cry every time.

1672
01:49:15,070 --> 01:49:17,450
It was like a haiku, but like with more syllables.

1673
01:49:19,610 --> 01:49:22,390
It was almost like a haiku, guys.

1674
01:49:22,990 --> 01:49:27,450
It's just like, you know, it might be just like a little bit
more syllables than it should be.

1675
01:49:27,690 --> 01:49:28,910
But it was almost like a haiku.

1676
01:49:30,010 --> 01:49:31,830
Doki Maido, FPS VTube.

1677
01:49:32,470 --> 01:49:35,470
And I are here to establish both of your...

1678
01:49:35,490 --> 01:49:36,190
Alibis.

1679
01:49:37,130 --> 01:49:39,150
It's snowing on Mount Fuji.

1680
01:49:41,250 --> 01:49:46,390
Can you walk us through what happened after Amy had everyone
leave the dining car?

1681
01:49:47,410 --> 01:49:48,330
Oh sure it's simple.

1682
01:49:49,010 --> 01:49:50,790
We just explained to Amy actually.

1683
01:49:52,310 --> 01:49:52,610
All right.

1684
01:49:53,610 --> 01:50:00,250
Okay so after this we gotta talk to this and then we gotta
talk to Shadow and then we solve the mystery when we're all

1685
01:50:00,250 --> 01:50:00,910
sent off.

1686
01:50:01,330 --> 01:50:05,110
It's always that it has to be like the last person and I
knew it was Shadow.

1687
01:50:05,490 --> 01:50:06,730
else were red herrings.

1688
01:50:08,190 --> 01:50:11,150
Shadow and Sonic all pass through this library car.

1689
01:50:12,830 --> 01:50:15,970
Where Amy told me and Espio to stay.

1690
01:50:17,470 --> 01:50:22,030
I promptly picked up a book off the shelf and made myself
comfortable.

1691
01:50:24,470 --> 01:50:28,690
Vector got bored so he left to see what Knuckles was up to
in the saloon car.

1692
01:50:29,710 --> 01:50:30,010
Yep.

1693
01:50:31,370 --> 01:50:32,170
Where was Rouge?

1694
01:50:32,750 --> 01:50:34,590
We happened to see her...

1695
01:50:34,590 --> 01:50:38,670
We happened to see her lipstick stain on a cup after saloon
car.

1696
01:50:39,850 --> 01:50:43,550
Rouge came over to the library car seemingly to look for
something.

1697
01:50:43,750 --> 01:50:44,330
Maybe money?

1698
01:50:44,570 --> 01:50:46,210
I mean, she's always looking for money, right?

1699
01:50:47,430 --> 01:50:49,750
Then she went to search the saloon car.

1700
01:50:50,850 --> 01:50:52,270
She came back shortly after.

1701
01:50:52,890 --> 01:50:55,410
We heard her shout, no way!

1702
01:50:55,850 --> 01:50:57,590
At the brochure stand over there.

1703
01:50:58,430 --> 01:51:02,430
But she left back to the casino car before Shadow came
through and locked the door.

1704
01:51:02,450 --> 01:51:04,910
It has to be like some sort of money thing.

1705
01:51:05,490 --> 01:51:08,150
Like, that's the only thing that gets, like, Rouge going.

1706
01:51:08,310 --> 01:51:09,750
It's always, like, money-related.

1707
01:51:11,810 --> 01:51:13,210
After all, she's a thief.

1708
01:51:14,230 --> 01:51:15,910
Unlike me, who's also a thief.

1709
01:51:17,550 --> 01:51:18,730
Wonder what she found.

1710
01:51:19,190 --> 01:51:22,470
She's also been on the hunt for something.

1711
01:51:24,110 --> 01:51:27,210
After Rouge left, Shadow walked through the casino car.

1712
01:51:29,790 --> 01:51:33,510
Then entered the library car and locked the door behind him.

1713
01:51:35,490 --> 01:51:37,210
Importantly, why has Shadow been locked?

1714
01:51:37,270 --> 01:51:39,190
Yeah, why have you been locking doors?

1715
01:51:39,830 --> 01:51:41,030
What is he trying to hide?

1716
01:51:41,450 --> 01:51:41,650
Huh?

1717
01:51:43,010 --> 01:51:49,270
Shadow walked through the library car to the saloon car
where Knuckles and I were playing games.

1718
01:51:49,970 --> 01:51:53,630
He insisted on showing us at Super Monkey Ball.

1719
01:51:54,770 --> 01:51:59,730
I got so engrossed by the rolling monkey action, I hardly
noticed when Shadow left the saloon car.

1720
01:52:01,190 --> 01:52:06,330
I guess he walked through the library car to the casino car
again locking the door behind him.

1721
01:52:08,290 --> 01:52:11,510
Then return to the lounge car where he was meant to be
stationed.

1722
01:52:13,830 --> 01:52:18,310
When Vector came back, we realized Knuckles locked the door
to the saloon car.

1723
01:52:18,870 --> 01:52:20,410
We were stuck in the library car.

1724
01:52:20,730 --> 01:52:23,150
Yes, because you're supposed to be stationed at your cars.

1725
01:52:23,610 --> 01:52:25,930
Are you not taking this game seriously?

1726
01:52:26,670 --> 01:52:27,970
Shadow took the game seriously.

1727
01:52:29,110 --> 01:52:30,210
It's Amy's birthday.

1728
01:52:31,890 --> 01:52:34,630
That's when the train stopped sped up.

1729
01:52:35,270 --> 01:52:38,470
We're worried about the bookshelves falling on us.

1730
01:52:39,010 --> 01:52:40,630
But we got through it all right.

1731
01:52:41,950 --> 01:52:45,910
We sat trapped here until Amy arrived, asking questions.

1732
01:52:46,650 --> 01:52:48,730
She's the one that told us someone murdered Sonic.

1733
01:52:50,430 --> 01:52:52,550
And yeah, that's all that happened.

1734
01:52:52,990 --> 01:52:54,750
I mean, they don't look like they're hiding anything.

1735
01:52:57,810 --> 01:53:04,510
With all these locked doors, it seems Victor Espio couldn't
have left the library car.

1736
01:53:05,790 --> 01:53:06,950
Or the saloon car.

1737
01:53:08,010 --> 01:53:09,810
Thank you both for your cooperation.

1738
01:53:10,730 --> 01:53:13,570
We're just gonna peek around and we'll return with any
questions.

1739
01:53:14,790 --> 01:53:16,530
If you return with any...

1740
01:53:16,530 --> 01:53:17,130
Me.

1741
01:53:18,150 --> 01:53:19,950
I'll chop it up for you.

1742
01:53:21,290 --> 01:53:26,930
And if you like to be serenaded with a poem, I've got you
covered.

1743
01:53:28,290 --> 01:53:29,230
Thanks, guys.

1744
01:53:30,590 --> 01:53:33,950
Their albines seem solid enough, but we should still search
for clues.

1745
01:53:33,970 --> 01:53:38,530
Why are we looking for it is evidence that proves what
they're saying?

1746
01:53:39,610 --> 01:53:40,370
It's true.

1747
01:53:41,890 --> 01:53:47,830
We need to confirm Vector's reason for leaving his post and
determine if Espio was actually in the library car.

1748
01:53:50,190 --> 01:53:52,710
A tall task, but we can do it.

1749
01:53:53,610 --> 01:53:55,190
Let's get to the bottom, this tells.

1750
01:53:56,050 --> 01:53:56,550
Absolutely!

1751
01:53:57,330 --> 01:53:57,650
Yay!

1752
01:53:58,830 --> 01:54:01,610
Okay, well, what were the brochures?

1753
01:54:02,350 --> 01:54:03,910
I mean, there's books everywhere.

1754
01:54:03,970 --> 01:54:05,830
So obviously they've been reading, right?

1755
01:54:06,510 --> 01:54:07,390
Oh yeah, where's the trash can?

1756
01:54:08,230 --> 01:54:09,690
Something's always hidden in trash.

1757
01:54:09,950 --> 01:54:10,690
Let's check it there.

1758
01:54:12,210 --> 01:54:14,130
I hate to say it, but there's nothing here.

1759
01:54:15,470 --> 01:54:16,910
I really thought there'd be something there.

1760
01:54:18,030 --> 01:54:19,510
Don't keep me, no FPS V-Tube.

1761
01:54:19,910 --> 01:54:21,730
Are you sad there was nothing in the trash bin?

1762
01:54:22,730 --> 01:54:23,170
No.

1763
01:54:24,830 --> 01:54:26,670
I got one guide.

1764
01:54:31,090 --> 01:54:31,970
I got one guide.

1765
01:54:34,330 --> 01:54:42,150
um i'm sure there's something hidden in the next trash bin
we're fine it's it's in the next one i swear i won't get one

1766
01:54:42,150 --> 01:54:53,670
guide again you really think so yeah we just gotta stay
optimistic yeah okay there's no way we get one guide again

1767
01:54:53,670 --> 01:55:03,050
right tails trust the stream joki made a fbsb team you're
pretty unconventional but i like that.

1768
01:55:03,670 --> 01:55:05,050
Is that supposed to be a compliment?

1769
01:55:05,990 --> 01:55:06,550
Alright.

1770
01:55:07,270 --> 01:55:09,790
Well, assume like what was she looking at the brochures?

1771
01:55:11,030 --> 01:55:11,590
Brochures!

1772
01:55:12,690 --> 01:55:14,170
There are travel destination ideas here.

1773
01:55:14,510 --> 01:55:17,610
Like amusement parks, caverns, hotels, restaurants.

1774
01:55:18,030 --> 01:55:18,430
Oh!

1775
01:55:20,490 --> 01:55:22,090
Joki Meadow FPS VTube!

1776
01:55:22,490 --> 01:55:23,030
Look at this!

1777
01:55:23,290 --> 01:55:24,370
There's a couple of maps here.

1778
01:55:24,810 --> 01:55:25,510
Wait, of what?

1779
01:55:25,730 --> 01:55:28,030
This is like literally... It's like...

1780
01:55:28,030 --> 01:55:29,990
It's a Sinclair line.

1781
01:55:31,550 --> 01:55:41,250
You go up or down This seems to be a map of The library car
The books are organized by genres Which are listed here I

1782
01:55:41,250 --> 01:55:49,090
love a good overhead map Let's take it Okay Should we take
this brochure about Cave 2?

1783
01:55:49,390 --> 01:55:59,750
Look, there's Stalagulatites Nah, leave it Yeah, that's fair
Wait, but what was the brochure that that Rouge was looking

1784
01:55:59,750 --> 01:56:12,010
at nobody shares my fondness for caves are they caves I mean
that makes sense actually well this is like scarily accurate

1785
01:56:13,610 --> 01:56:22,850
to my Sonic OC I wish we had time to pick them up I sadly
have no interest in picking up these books a lot of these

1786
01:56:22,850 --> 01:56:30,850
were knocked out by the train speeding up but Rouge pulled a
lot of these out searching for something.

1787
01:56:31,470 --> 01:56:32,510
What's she searching for?

1788
01:56:33,050 --> 01:56:34,510
What reckless behavior?

1789
01:56:35,190 --> 01:56:36,650
I feel sorry for the poor books.

1790
01:56:37,950 --> 01:56:39,030
The spines are creasing.

1791
01:56:39,270 --> 01:56:40,650
They're opening too far.

1792
01:56:41,750 --> 01:56:44,030
This kid feels empathy for everything.

1793
01:56:45,170 --> 01:56:50,630
Wait, what could it be that could like disprove what they're
saying?

1794
01:56:52,030 --> 01:56:53,510
Like, do I look at the books?

1795
01:56:54,230 --> 01:56:54,790
Wow.

1796
01:56:55,510 --> 01:56:57,990
I wish I could stop and look at all these books.

1797
01:56:58,650 --> 01:57:00,570
But Sonic needs me.

1798
01:57:00,750 --> 01:57:02,070
No time to rest.

1799
01:57:02,910 --> 01:57:04,370
Alright, let's move on then.

1800
01:57:04,890 --> 01:57:05,110
Hmm.

1801
01:57:05,950 --> 01:57:07,650
I mean, a little peek wouldn't hurt.

1802
01:57:08,770 --> 01:57:11,270
He's scavenging through all the books a little excitedly.

1803
01:57:12,250 --> 01:57:13,970
He's like a kid in a candy shop.

1804
01:57:14,490 --> 01:57:17,270
Or in this case, a genius in a train library.

1805
01:57:18,770 --> 01:57:19,730
That's odd.

1806
01:57:21,410 --> 01:57:24,430
I know some books have fallen out on the floor and
everything.

1807
01:57:26,510 --> 01:57:26,990
But...

1808
01:57:26,990 --> 01:57:28,330
Every book on these shelves...

1809
01:57:28,350 --> 01:57:31,230
It's an alphabetical order.

1810
01:57:32,310 --> 01:57:34,390
But this one...

1811
01:57:34,390 --> 01:57:34,690
Oh!

1812
01:57:35,990 --> 01:57:38,050
How the fuck did you notice that?

1813
01:57:38,330 --> 01:57:39,910
Who looks at the alphabetical...

1814
01:57:39,910 --> 01:57:41,810
Oh my god, what a fucking nerd.

1815
01:57:42,330 --> 01:57:43,030
This is...

1816
01:57:43,930 --> 01:57:47,170
This is why you're not hanging out with other kids, Tams.

1817
01:57:47,810 --> 01:57:50,110
This is why you're hanging out with adults.

1818
01:57:55,890 --> 01:57:58,330
It's the user guide to the Mirage...

1819
01:57:58,350 --> 01:57:58,910
Express.

1820
01:57:59,510 --> 01:58:01,430
The train we're currently on.

1821
01:58:02,890 --> 01:58:05,530
Do you think someone found it on the ground and put it back?

1822
01:58:07,110 --> 01:58:07,470
Hmm.

1823
01:58:07,970 --> 01:58:09,990
It is interesting.

1824
01:58:10,910 --> 01:58:12,610
Okay, that's mean.

1825
01:58:13,250 --> 01:58:14,990
Where are your children friends?

1826
01:58:15,610 --> 01:58:17,910
Where are your friends at your age, Taz?

1827
01:58:19,210 --> 01:58:21,630
Let's make a note of this.

1828
01:58:24,190 --> 01:58:37,050
Mirage Express manual is added to your all right we got the

1834
01:59:26,830 --> 01:59:28,070
even want to trade school?

1835
01:59:29,130 --> 01:59:31,290
Maybe people just appreciate an omelette.

1836
01:59:32,850 --> 01:59:34,770
You may not be wrong.

1837
01:59:36,370 --> 01:59:36,630
Okay.

1838
01:59:37,870 --> 01:59:38,470
Oh, the seat?

1839
01:59:38,610 --> 01:59:38,850
No.

1840
01:59:39,650 --> 01:59:40,350
What would...

1841
01:59:40,870 --> 01:59:42,790
I don't feel like...

1842
01:59:42,790 --> 01:59:44,590
Is there anything else?

1843
01:59:45,030 --> 01:59:45,430
Okay.

1844
01:59:46,990 --> 01:59:47,490
Oh.

1845
01:59:48,410 --> 01:59:49,690
What other fucking...

1846
01:59:51,950 --> 01:59:52,850
Oh, wait.

1847
01:59:53,230 --> 01:59:54,130
Maybe the lights?

1848
01:59:54,370 --> 01:59:54,910
Oh, okay.

1849
01:59:54,970 --> 01:59:55,510
Never mind.

1850
01:59:55,670 --> 01:59:56,670
Check out our boat.

1851
01:59:56,690 --> 02:00:12,510
club on the train book of the month gone gal that's nice
what what what can i oh wait do i have do i have all the

1852
02:00:12,510 --> 02:00:22,910
evidence okay let's see this is that and then huh

1853
02:00:26,690 --> 02:00:28,930
I don't have all the evidence yet.

1854
02:00:31,410 --> 02:00:32,650
The chairs are very comfy.

1855
02:00:32,870 --> 02:00:34,970
Puts me right in the Muto read.

1856
02:00:35,710 --> 02:00:38,690
Makes me want to take a nap personally.

1857
02:00:39,870 --> 02:00:42,250
In fact, maybe I'll rest my eyes a little bit.

1858
02:00:43,010 --> 02:00:44,610
Joki made a FPS VTube?

1859
02:00:44,930 --> 02:00:45,250
No.

1860
02:00:45,670 --> 02:00:46,930
Don't fall asleep.

1861
02:00:47,610 --> 02:00:50,770
Only got four hours of sleep, Tess.

1862
02:00:53,930 --> 02:00:56,570
There's been a fake murder.

1863
02:00:58,970 --> 02:01:03,050
I have a ring for every time a murder ruined my nap time.

1864
02:01:04,150 --> 02:01:05,150
That is a bit concerning.

1865
02:01:09,510 --> 02:01:10,370
Oh, poor thing.

1866
02:01:10,610 --> 02:01:13,190
That arm is really struggling cleaning up this car.

1867
02:01:13,990 --> 02:01:16,230
To be fair, I wouldn't want to clean up all this mess
either.

1868
02:01:17,110 --> 02:01:18,890
Let's just leave it alone and do a thing.

1869
02:01:20,070 --> 02:01:21,630
Yeah, probably for the best.

1870
02:01:22,710 --> 02:01:22,970
What?

1871
02:01:23,490 --> 02:01:28,430
I feel like I looked at all the evidence, except for hang in
there, I'm pretty sure that's not evidence.

1872
02:01:29,030 --> 02:01:31,670
A globe of our marvelous planet.

1873
02:01:32,710 --> 02:01:34,290
I haven't traveled around much.

1874
02:01:35,030 --> 02:01:36,750
The islands are fun and all.

1875
02:01:37,150 --> 02:01:39,450
But I love to visit some of the counties.

1876
02:01:41,030 --> 02:01:42,390
They're a lot of fun, honestly.

1877
02:01:42,750 --> 02:01:44,370
Plenty of the wonderful people and shops.

1878
02:01:44,830 --> 02:01:46,890
The food can't be beat either.

1879
02:01:48,170 --> 02:01:50,090
Sounds perfect for a vacation.

1880
02:01:50,610 --> 02:01:52,930
The conductor was talking about Spagonia.

1881
02:01:53,630 --> 02:01:54,730
Have you ever been there?

1882
02:01:56,570 --> 02:01:57,070
actually.

1883
02:01:57,990 --> 02:02:02,330
If you're ever visiting, be sure to stop at the university
and say hi to Professor Pickle.

1884
02:02:03,510 --> 02:02:07,550
I'll tell you everything about the area and make one
scrumptious sandwich.

1885
02:02:08,770 --> 02:02:09,630
I'll keep that in mind.

1886
02:02:10,390 --> 02:02:10,390
Thanks.

1887
02:02:11,750 --> 02:02:13,930
This group knows everyone and has been everywhere, haven't
it?

1888
02:02:13,990 --> 02:02:15,010
Yeah, they're fucking rich.

1889
02:02:15,410 --> 02:02:16,850
Doki Meido, FPSV Tube.

1890
02:02:17,390 --> 02:02:19,350
You're just a train boy.

1891
02:02:20,010 --> 02:02:21,590
You barely earn minimum wage.

1892
02:02:22,790 --> 02:02:23,710
Alright, let's see.

1893
02:02:23,990 --> 02:02:26,270
I feel like I talked to everything except for this.

1894
02:02:26,330 --> 02:02:28,010
I swear God, this cannot be a clue.

1895
02:02:28,550 --> 02:02:29,970
Let me talk to Vector.

1896
02:02:31,210 --> 02:02:32,770
Do you bring me any meat to chop?

1897
02:02:33,670 --> 02:02:35,070
I may be a butcher.

1898
02:02:35,970 --> 02:02:36,170
Uh.

1899
02:02:37,570 --> 02:02:42,250
But they confiscated my meat cleaver before getting on the
train.

1900
02:02:44,530 --> 02:02:46,390
You actually try to bring a knife on the train?

1901
02:02:46,730 --> 02:02:47,410
I mean, I did.

1902
02:02:48,090 --> 02:02:49,070
Stop, stop.

1903
02:02:50,830 --> 02:02:53,330
I'm a man of authenticity.

1904
02:02:54,330 --> 02:02:56,530
Tess, with a knife, I'm just a chef.

1905
02:02:56,690 --> 02:02:58,870
And a ketchup-stained apron.

1906
02:02:59,450 --> 02:03:00,270
Not a butcher.

1907
02:03:01,630 --> 02:03:02,770
You got a knife on you.

1908
02:03:02,910 --> 02:03:04,290
We definitely think you're the murderer.

1909
02:03:06,430 --> 02:03:06,530
Um.

1910
02:03:14,290 --> 02:03:15,210
Except for me.

1911
02:03:18,410 --> 02:03:21,030
But what if I hit the knife?

1912
02:03:24,910 --> 02:03:26,670
You know, I'm not the biggest fan of that.

1913
02:03:26,690 --> 02:03:27,790
a lot of thought.

1914
02:03:28,910 --> 02:03:30,970
Alright, can I start in my interrogation now?

1915
02:03:32,010 --> 02:03:33,910
I don't think we have enough evidence yet.

1916
02:03:34,350 --> 02:03:37,310
Why don't we take a look a little more look around.

1917
02:03:37,570 --> 02:03:38,490
Wait, then what the fuck?

1918
02:03:38,950 --> 02:03:39,890
What the fuck am I missing?

1919
02:03:40,830 --> 02:03:42,430
I looked at these books.

1920
02:03:42,670 --> 02:03:43,990
I looked at that book.

1921
02:03:45,410 --> 02:03:47,570
I looked at the table.

1922
02:03:49,230 --> 02:03:50,750
I looked at those books.

1923
02:03:51,710 --> 02:03:53,570
Is there more books that I forgot?

1924
02:03:55,730 --> 02:03:56,590
The door?

1925
02:03:58,910 --> 02:04:06,510
shadow supposedly walked through the library door before
going to the saloon car oh my god i was supposed to look at

1926
02:04:06,510 --> 02:04:15,090
the door my shadow left the library car he locked this door
on his way out there's got to be a reason he's doing this

1927
02:04:15,090 --> 02:04:26,310
should we make a note of it hmm i do believe we should
shadow's lock is added to your inventory i think we found

1928
02:04:26,310 --> 02:04:28,050
enough It was the fucking door.

1929
02:04:29,130 --> 02:04:30,310
Let's go interrogate Vector.

1930
02:04:30,530 --> 02:04:31,310
I have no idea.

1931
02:04:31,710 --> 02:04:32,110
I don't know.

1932
02:04:32,350 --> 02:04:34,070
I don't know what the reasoning is.

1933
02:04:34,750 --> 02:04:35,630
Guys, I don't even know.

1934
02:04:35,890 --> 02:04:38,330
I'm going to have to have the game to handhold me.

1935
02:04:38,750 --> 02:04:41,610
I don't know what we figured out.

1936
02:04:44,270 --> 02:04:45,770
Alright, start interrogation.

1937
02:04:47,270 --> 02:04:51,630
So, the two of us, you don't believe us, eh?

1938
02:04:52,450 --> 02:04:54,210
It's not that I don't trust either of you.

1939
02:04:55,870 --> 02:04:56,350
But...

1940
02:04:56,690 --> 02:04:59,890
proper detectives while examining the validity of your
alibis.

1941
02:05:00,870 --> 02:05:04,350
Doki made a FPS V-tube, and I are here to confirm two
things.

1942
02:05:05,190 --> 02:05:05,530
Why?

1943
02:05:05,850 --> 02:05:10,830
Vector left to go play games with Knuckles, and if Espio
really was reading in the library car.

1944
02:05:12,150 --> 02:05:13,410
Vector, we'll start with you.

1945
02:05:14,270 --> 02:05:17,270
Why did you leave the library car to visit Knuckles?

1946
02:05:17,890 --> 02:05:19,210
We're prepared to present evidence.

1947
02:05:20,250 --> 02:05:20,590
Hmm.

1948
02:05:20,930 --> 02:05:21,610
Oh, that's easy.

1949
02:05:21,690 --> 02:05:22,130
I got bored.

1950
02:05:25,410 --> 02:05:26,430
That's just a thing.

1951
02:05:26,690 --> 02:05:28,470
Why would you put the butcher in the library?

1952
02:05:28,730 --> 02:05:30,510
It doesn't make sense, Amy.

1953
02:05:31,510 --> 02:05:31,910
Amy.

1954
02:05:32,810 --> 02:05:34,030
This is not immersive.

1955
02:05:34,490 --> 02:05:36,150
Why is he in the library?

1956
02:05:37,570 --> 02:05:38,750
Unless he's getting some meat.

1957
02:05:42,430 --> 02:05:42,590
What?

1958
02:05:44,290 --> 02:05:45,650
I wasn't entertaining.

1959
02:05:45,790 --> 02:05:46,630
Oh, damn.

1960
02:05:47,010 --> 02:05:47,530
SPO.

1961
02:05:47,750 --> 02:05:48,270
Damn.

1962
02:05:48,850 --> 02:05:49,710
That sucks, man.

1963
02:05:51,910 --> 02:05:54,470
I was entertaining him enough, it seems.

1964
02:05:55,010 --> 02:05:56,670
Vector enjoys being so...

1965
02:05:56,690 --> 02:05:57,050
social.

1966
02:05:58,350 --> 02:05:59,070
Damn, Espio.

1967
02:05:59,450 --> 02:06:00,510
Just no chemistry, huh?

1968
02:06:00,830 --> 02:06:01,870
Just no chemistry.

1969
02:06:08,550 --> 02:06:10,670
Plus, we were instructed to mingle.

1970
02:06:11,410 --> 02:06:15,030
I remembered the arcade machine in the saloon car.

1971
02:06:15,530 --> 02:06:17,010
So I figured I'd go check it out.

1972
02:06:18,830 --> 02:06:21,670
This seems to line up with the information we gathered with
Knuckles.

1973
02:06:22,930 --> 02:06:25,010
That brings our intention to you, Espio.

1974
02:06:25,910 --> 02:06:35,490
Will you enter the library car found something and then left
you said you immediately started reading but you're you

1975
02:06:35,490 --> 02:06:48,690
actually reading the entire time you were in the library car
hmm of course he was huh once espio starts reading he

1976
02:06:48,690 --> 02:06:57,970
doesn't stop till it's done i've seen it happen damn simp it
must have been a good read.

1977
02:06:58,290 --> 02:06:59,430
What was the book?

1978
02:07:04,030 --> 02:07:06,670
SPO doesn't owe you that, detective.

1979
02:07:07,150 --> 02:07:07,930
Where's the warrant?

1980
02:07:08,770 --> 02:07:08,770
Huh?

1981
02:07:10,030 --> 02:07:12,090
I won't talk until my lawyer's here.

1982
02:07:12,850 --> 02:07:14,130
Let the man live.

1983
02:07:16,210 --> 02:07:18,110
What if it was embarrassing?

1984
02:07:19,170 --> 02:07:20,930
What kind of things do you think I read?

1985
02:07:22,530 --> 02:07:26,250
If you won't talk, I have a hunch on what that book might
be.

1986
02:07:26,690 --> 02:07:27,370
Hmm.

1987
02:07:27,750 --> 02:07:29,270
Yoki made a FPS V-Tube.

1988
02:07:29,570 --> 02:07:30,430
Can you help me out?

1989
02:07:30,710 --> 02:07:31,150
Let's see.

1990
02:07:31,390 --> 02:07:33,730
I wonder if I have an evidence that's just a book.

1991
02:07:35,170 --> 02:07:38,710
Guys, what book do you think SBO may have been reading?

1992
02:07:42,110 --> 02:07:42,670
Hmm.

1993
02:07:43,890 --> 02:07:45,170
I must have.

1994
02:07:45,730 --> 02:07:49,690
I wonder, I wonder which one is a book.

1995
02:07:53,550 --> 02:07:54,110
Hmm.

1996
02:07:58,310 --> 02:08:10,410
a manual you think espia was reading instructions what
argument could you possibly have to support this think oh no

1997
02:08:10,410 --> 02:08:19,910
it's time it's time to it's time to parkour oh no there you
go i like how it's like sonic as like the oh no no why did i

1998
02:08:19,910 --> 02:08:27,710
jump why did i jump wait what there's no i got confused i
was That was a new mechanic that was introduced And I

1999
02:08:27,710 --> 02:08:34,690
wasn't, I wasn't sure what was going on Okay, alright, I
figured it out I got confused They gave me a new mechanic

2000
02:08:35,410 --> 02:08:42,970
And I wasn't prepared I didn't have time to actually
register What it was, but it's okay, I'm a gamer I like how

2001
02:08:42,970 --> 02:08:52,310
I like My name's up there too There are books scattered
Around the floor, sure But raining books on the shelves were

2002
02:08:52,310 --> 02:09:03,790
all In alphabetical order all except this manual needs
someone at the very least picked up the manual up and put it

2003
02:09:03,790 --> 02:09:08,530
back in the incorrect place bum bum

2004
02:09:11,910 --> 02:09:24,650
this lack of attention to detail isn't normally like USPO
hey now I won't have you insulting my pal like this calm

2005
02:09:24,650 --> 02:09:38,210
down vector i know you me well but i can handle myself
apologies espio a butcher and a poet friendship can form

2006
02:09:38,210 --> 02:09:52,990
anywhere that is indeed the book i was reading the mirage
express manual trains are okay trains are cool i like trains

2007
02:09:55,030 --> 02:09:59,470
In that case, we'd like to ask you a few questions about the
manual.

2008
02:09:59,890 --> 02:10:02,710
Doki made our FPS V-Tube, if you don't mind.

2009
02:10:03,870 --> 02:10:04,710
That's me.

2010
02:10:05,930 --> 02:10:06,530
That's me.

2011
02:10:07,910 --> 02:10:10,230
Can you ask SBR some questions about the manual?

2012
02:10:10,910 --> 02:10:12,670
Just flip to a page and ask away.

2013
02:10:13,790 --> 02:10:14,290
Oh, I see.

2014
02:10:14,710 --> 02:10:17,030
Quiz SBR about the manual to prove he read it.

2015
02:10:17,830 --> 02:10:18,970
Which page should I quiz him on?

2016
02:10:19,170 --> 02:10:20,090
I don't fucking know.

2017
02:10:21,050 --> 02:10:21,570
362.

2018
02:10:23,390 --> 02:10:29,110
What efficient and extraordinary extremely accurate
technology was installed to assist and keep what is he like

2019
02:10:29,110 --> 02:10:37,190
does he like fucking has like that type what's that memory
photographing memory like what the fuck keeping those trains

2020
02:10:37,190 --> 02:10:47,030
spotless oh my god okay this is like a random story but this
reminded me of the time where like um i and i think it was

2021
02:10:47,030 --> 02:10:55,050
like in middle school i was like chosen to do like some
fucking like uh some like uh academic tournament or

2022
02:10:55,050 --> 02:11:02,590
something where it was like separated by different uh
different subjects like psychology math reading english and

2023
02:11:02,590 --> 02:11:08,230
stuff like that and then like and like special subject and
then i was selected to be on that team it was like this like

2024
02:11:08,230 --> 02:11:16,510
academic quiz so like you have to have like like like
multiple choice questions to answer debate and uh Do not say

2025
02:11:16,510 --> 02:11:27,130
nerd Do not say nerd writing an essay And you're competing
against like Different types Different schools And then like

2026
02:11:27,130 --> 02:11:35,930
I was studying for it And then um You know I was studying
for it And like the bus ride To like The venue Like because

2027
02:11:35,930 --> 02:11:42,170
like I was like You know Getting some last minute study on
And this kid Like sat in Okay I was also a kid But this kid

2028
02:11:42,170 --> 02:11:49,110
like sat next to me And then he was like oh you're doing
you're like um brushing up and i was like yeah i am and then

2029
02:11:49,110 --> 02:11:52,530
he was like give me a page and i was like what

2030
02:11:56,300 --> 02:12:08,500
it was like give me a page and i was like oh and i was like
this page and then he read word to word what it was on that

2031
02:12:08,500 --> 02:12:12,640
page and then that was the day i realized i'm not special

2032
02:12:19,240 --> 02:12:22,520
I was not special.

2033
02:12:23,460 --> 02:12:30,200
I'm not nerd enough.

2034
02:12:30,940 --> 02:12:33,600
There is always someone stronger.

2035
02:12:35,660 --> 02:12:36,520
Okay.

2036
02:12:37,220 --> 02:12:44,880
What efficient and extremely accurate technology was
installed to assist in keeping the train spotless?

2037
02:12:44,880 --> 02:12:56,420
it is um robot okay and then like i tested him in various
other pages and yeah news to say i'm pretty sure that kid

2038
02:12:56,420 --> 02:12:57,900
did really well

2039
02:13:01,420 --> 02:13:09,720
robotic arms during events they can perform a variety of
tasks and are responsible for cleaning up the trash and

2040
02:13:09,720 --> 02:13:18,160
messes afterwards he was the bigger nerd I remember the
conductor saying that the train can clean himself.

2041
02:13:19,480 --> 02:13:23,080
So, I have a feeling the train company just didn't want to
hire any janitors.

2042
02:13:23,600 --> 02:13:27,340
I mean, like, why would you need to hire janitors when
literally the train does it for you?

2043
02:13:27,560 --> 02:13:28,780
Like, it doesn't even get paid.

2044
02:13:29,240 --> 02:13:31,500
Robots don't need to get paid because they don't have
rights.

2045
02:13:33,180 --> 02:13:42,920
The robotic arms can also detect weapons or explosive beings
brought onto the train, ensuring passenger safety.

2046
02:13:44,880 --> 02:13:53,060
your ace that question joking made of fps v2 hit him with
another one oh my god we know we know already we don't need

2047
02:13:53,060 --> 02:13:59,540
to hit him with another one oh my god tails he definitely
knows what he's talking about i'm giving a literally a

2048
02:13:59,540 --> 02:14:12,420
random page what is a mirage express cancellation policy no
refunds and you will be charged a no show fee this does not

2049
02:14:12,420 --> 02:14:15,480
apply if you're over the age 65.

2050
02:14:17,520 --> 02:14:21,040
Gee, the person who made this rule must have been over 65.

2051
02:14:22,040 --> 02:14:23,480
He was like 66.

2052
02:14:25,100 --> 02:14:25,940
Last one.

2053
02:14:26,260 --> 02:14:27,520
Joke, he made an FPS V2.

2054
02:14:27,900 --> 02:14:30,120
Let's see if Espio can go 3 for 3.

2055
02:14:30,500 --> 02:14:33,340
After the first one, it should be okay, Tess.

2056
02:14:34,120 --> 02:14:35,020
Oh my god.

2057
02:14:35,160 --> 02:14:38,520
Don't be jealous that he's a bigger fucking nerd than you
are.

2058
02:14:40,060 --> 02:14:40,580
Like...

2059
02:14:42,340 --> 02:14:43,380
Alright, 402.

2060
02:14:44,320 --> 02:14:52,320
What was implemented to support the conductor duties and
means general train obligation an intelligent data

2061
02:14:52,320 --> 02:15:02,240
processing system it works in tandem with the conductor to
ensure smooth travel for guests i remember this the train

2062
02:15:02,240 --> 02:15:11,080
has an autopilot but it can't access its full suite of
capabilities without the conductor present no did i pass

2063
02:15:11,080 --> 02:15:21,000
your little test no no i don't want to to keep going yes
totally it's wild you're able to retain all this information

2064
02:15:21,000 --> 02:15:32,500
so quickly a poet's brain is often surprising i don't know
if i'd be bragging about that clearly read the manual those

2065
02:15:32,500 --> 02:15:43,220
answers feel far too specific to be oh my god tails just
accept it is a bigger nerd than you Oh my god, Tess.

2066
02:15:44,480 --> 02:15:47,660
And you both had the nerve to question my buddy like that.

2067
02:15:48,580 --> 02:15:50,520
Don't we want to be supportive folks who read?

2068
02:15:50,860 --> 02:15:52,220
You don't even read, Vector.

2069
02:15:53,680 --> 02:16:01,640
You have to admit, though, reading the entire time a murder
occurred does sound a bit suspicious, even if it's true.

2070
02:16:02,800 --> 02:16:05,260
We answered all my questions so calmly.

2071
02:16:05,920 --> 02:16:06,960
That's very impressive.

2072
02:16:08,680 --> 02:16:09,160
No, no.

2073
02:16:11,480 --> 02:16:12,600
cautious attitudes.

2074
02:16:13,760 --> 02:16:15,800
Vector was the only one to see me reading after all.

2075
02:16:16,340 --> 02:16:20,200
My alibi is hard to substantiate despite being the truth.

2076
02:16:22,440 --> 02:16:24,960
Well, I definitely read through the manual.

2077
02:16:25,500 --> 02:16:26,820
So I suppose we can...

2078
02:16:28,560 --> 02:16:29,880
Espio, is that true?

2079
02:16:30,560 --> 02:16:32,840
Vector was the only one to see you reading?

2080
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:34,300
Yes.

2081
02:16:34,760 --> 02:16:35,380
That's correct.

2082
02:16:35,440 --> 02:16:36,220
Wait, what about Rouge?

2083
02:16:36,680 --> 02:16:38,080
Wouldn't Rouge see me read?

2084
02:16:39,040 --> 02:16:41,300
Frankly, I don't believe that can be true.

2085
02:16:41,820 --> 02:16:45,400
And we have Evans to back it up.

2086
02:16:46,420 --> 02:16:47,560
Joki made our FPS V2.

2087
02:16:47,680 --> 02:16:48,200
Wait, we do?

2088
02:16:49,200 --> 02:16:51,380
He always puts me on this spot.

2089
02:16:51,620 --> 02:16:52,140
We do?

2090
02:16:55,760 --> 02:16:57,900
Who also saw SPO reading?

2091
02:16:58,860 --> 02:16:59,500
Uh...

2092
02:17:00,280 --> 02:17:01,000
Uh...

2093
02:17:01,760 --> 02:17:02,480
Um...

2094
02:17:02,480 --> 02:17:04,500
I guess... The map?

2095
02:17:06,960 --> 02:17:07,680
Uh...

2096
02:17:12,780 --> 02:17:16,180
Um, oh, Shadow, wait, what about the menu?

2097
02:17:16,600 --> 02:17:17,600
Not sure what we're trying to say that.

2098
02:17:17,800 --> 02:17:18,940
Don't waste my time.

2099
02:17:19,620 --> 02:17:21,320
But what if people are hungry?

2100
02:17:22,140 --> 02:17:23,200
Okay, Shadow's love.

2101
02:17:23,860 --> 02:17:24,620
Shadow's blog?

2102
02:17:25,120 --> 02:17:29,560
Please, pray, tell me, what does that have to do with
anything?

2103
02:17:31,140 --> 02:17:33,660
We're up, Doki Mado, FPS, VTube.

2104
02:17:34,160 --> 02:17:35,860
Let's get our argument together!

2105
02:17:36,500 --> 02:17:39,800
Okay, are you also playing this little game while we're
thinking, too, Tess?

2106
02:17:40,240 --> 02:17:42,020
Do we both have any Dream Gear?

2107
02:17:43,980 --> 02:17:44,680
It's okay.

2108
02:17:45,080 --> 02:17:46,280
I figured it out.

2109
02:17:49,260 --> 02:17:49,600
It's okay.

2110
02:17:49,640 --> 02:17:50,640
I'm thinking right now.

2111
02:17:51,120 --> 02:17:52,680
Guys, this is what happens in my brain.

2112
02:17:53,200 --> 02:17:56,060
You guys are like, what is going on in that little tomato
brain of hers?

2113
02:17:56,400 --> 02:17:57,280
This is what happens.

2114
02:17:57,400 --> 02:17:59,020
I'm playing a little Sonic game.

2115
02:18:00,780 --> 02:18:01,180
Wee!

2116
02:18:01,560 --> 02:18:03,260
Oh my gosh, I'm doing so well.

2117
02:18:03,840 --> 02:18:04,240
Yay!

2118
02:18:06,340 --> 02:18:06,740
Yay!

2119
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:10,320
Oh my god, this is like longer than before.

2120
02:18:11,300 --> 02:18:12,040
Alright, nice.

2121
02:18:12,760 --> 02:18:14,840
I got 23 more.

2122
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:16,640
Just like me.

2123
02:18:16,880 --> 02:18:18,520
This is how my brain works on Sonic.

2124
02:18:19,720 --> 02:18:27,000
Shadow walked through that library car to get to go to the
saloon car, where he set the original high score on the

2125
02:18:27,000 --> 02:18:27,880
arcade machine.

2126
02:18:29,120 --> 02:18:31,500
Yeah, but I ended up beating it.

2127
02:18:32,080 --> 02:18:34,040
It wasn't a high score for long.

2128
02:18:35,860 --> 02:18:38,620
Crocs are natural gamers.

2129
02:18:39,800 --> 02:18:42,440
Espio said he saw Shadow enter the library car.

2130
02:18:42,760 --> 02:18:45,920
But, he's mentioned nothing about Shadow's return.

2131
02:18:47,240 --> 02:18:49,020
He only mentioned that Vector came back.

2132
02:18:50,120 --> 02:18:57,500
When Shadow left Knuckles and Vector in the saloon car,
Espio was fully seated reading his book for a good while at

2133
02:18:57,500 --> 02:18:58,080
that point.

2134
02:19:00,920 --> 02:19:07,020
We know Shadow had to walk back through the library car when
he left the saloon car.

2135
02:19:08,500 --> 02:19:12,740
So, there's absolutely no way Shadow and Espio...

2136
02:19:12,760 --> 02:19:18,440
Didn't notice one another on Shadow's return trip.

2137
02:19:19,320 --> 02:19:23,780
Oh, he's cooking.

2138
02:19:24,980 --> 02:19:27,500
I mean, it was a simple slip-up.

2139
02:19:28,220 --> 02:19:32,040
I was just fully immersed in my book that didn't notice
Shadow.

2140
02:19:32,460 --> 02:19:34,100
Yep, yep, that's it.

2141
02:19:34,700 --> 02:19:36,160
When nerds attack each other.

2142
02:19:36,560 --> 02:19:42,740
Nerdfight, you're telling me that sound of the door opening
and locking wouldn't have cost.

2143
02:19:42,760 --> 02:19:43,540
you to look up.

2144
02:19:43,840 --> 02:19:44,420
Nerdfight!

2145
02:19:45,620 --> 02:19:47,420
Well, you see?

2146
02:19:47,820 --> 02:19:48,440
Take that!

2147
02:19:49,600 --> 02:19:52,340
I can sense desperation here.

2148
02:19:52,860 --> 02:19:55,620
Defending the argument that he was reading the entire time
isn't easy.

2149
02:19:56,500 --> 02:20:00,380
So if you didn't see Shadow returning from the saloon car,
it locked all the doors.

2150
02:20:01,200 --> 02:20:05,880
And at that moment, were you really in the library car at
all?

2151
02:20:07,860 --> 02:20:09,360
How would SBO leave?

2152
02:20:09,880 --> 02:20:11,280
Shadow locked all the cars.

2153
02:20:11,780 --> 02:20:12,740
No one saw SBO in the car.

2154
02:20:12,760 --> 02:20:24,300
saloon car she we went to the casino it's a mystery my dear
doki made of fbsv sorry it's a mystery my dear doki made of

2155
02:20:24,300 --> 02:20:36,660
fbsv tube um one that would love for espio to solve oh my
god he was gambling the biggest crime are you even over 21

2156
02:20:36,660 --> 02:20:45,000
the gamble espio you gotta believe me That cool demeanor is
vanishing.

2157
02:20:45,840 --> 02:20:49,960
I so involved my book, I didn't until a shadow passed
through the library car.

2158
02:20:50,500 --> 02:20:50,880
Honest.

2159
02:20:52,380 --> 02:20:55,920
When Vector returned, he even had to tap me on the shoulder
to get my attention.

2160
02:20:56,980 --> 02:20:58,160
Yeah, I think I remember.

2161
02:20:58,520 --> 02:20:58,940
I think.

2162
02:21:00,500 --> 02:21:02,300
I think I remember doing that.

2163
02:21:06,400 --> 02:21:11,080
I must avenge my friend's death so I can ask you again, SBO.

2164
02:21:11,660 --> 02:21:14,400
If you weren't there for Shadow to see you reading, then...

2165
02:21:14,420 --> 02:21:15,880
How did you leave the library car?

2166
02:21:17,040 --> 02:21:18,080
I wasn't.

2167
02:21:18,440 --> 02:21:19,840
I didn't.

2168
02:21:21,020 --> 02:21:22,780
How does this seem right to me?

2169
02:21:23,620 --> 02:21:25,620
Tails definitely feels like he's on to something.

2170
02:21:26,360 --> 02:21:28,260
But I don't see it.

2171
02:21:29,040 --> 02:21:31,300
Was Espiel simply sitting, reading?

2172
02:21:31,900 --> 02:21:33,560
Or did he send me a badge to not notice?

2173
02:21:33,740 --> 02:21:35,080
Shall I return to the library car?

2174
02:21:35,940 --> 02:21:36,920
What should I do?

2175
02:21:38,160 --> 02:21:39,200
Join Tails.

2176
02:21:44,940 --> 02:21:55,400
hmm you know what you know what I'm only all in on Tails
joining Tails no I can't interrupt Tails while he's on to

2177
02:21:55,400 --> 02:22:06,800
something I'll let him continue this line and questioning
and Docu made a FPS VTube my fate wait does he like get more

2178
02:22:06,800 --> 02:22:15,580
and more like are these like real memories or he just like
made up these memories at this point fate because like i met

2179
02:22:15,580 --> 02:22:25,480

like it doesn't even feel like his actual flat like made up

2180
02:22:25,480 --> 02:22:39,580
flashback protect the passengers aboard this train they must
be taken care of if you fail oh yeah that's that the

2181
02:22:39,580 --> 02:22:41,500
lawsuits will be torturous.

2182
02:22:42,140 --> 02:22:46,740
Don't allow such an old, feeble soul to get sued.

2183
02:22:47,960 --> 02:22:49,940
I was going to be like, I just met that guy.

2184
02:22:50,260 --> 02:22:52,460
How do I have so many flashbacks?

2185
02:22:53,180 --> 02:22:55,120
I have to make sure our guests are taken care of.

2186
02:22:55,220 --> 02:22:55,760
Oh my gosh.

2187
02:22:55,860 --> 02:22:56,680
I'm hearing voices.

2188
02:22:57,340 --> 02:22:58,300
I have to speak up.

2189
02:22:58,940 --> 02:22:59,420
Tails!

2190
02:23:01,180 --> 02:23:04,380
We have a piece of evidence that can answer all of our
problems.

2191
02:23:05,140 --> 02:23:06,080
Alright, my fellow associate.

2192
02:23:06,620 --> 02:23:07,620
Lay it on me.

2193
02:23:08,120 --> 02:23:11,800
What piece of evidence shows Shadow and Espio Couldn't have
seen one another.

2194
02:23:12,660 --> 02:23:13,920
The map!

2195
02:23:15,520 --> 02:23:16,900
Look at the map!

2196
02:23:18,840 --> 02:23:20,980
This one, because it's my last evidence.

2197
02:23:21,820 --> 02:23:23,360
Now let's get my thoughts in order.

2198
02:23:23,660 --> 02:23:24,400
Alright, it's time to game.

2199
02:23:24,580 --> 02:23:25,340
Sorry, give me a sec.

2200
02:23:25,480 --> 02:23:26,700
I'm gaming real quick, Tails.

2201
02:23:27,120 --> 02:23:27,620
Don't worry.

2202
02:23:29,400 --> 02:23:32,660
When I'm finished gaming, I'll be able to answer your
question.

2203
02:23:36,660 --> 02:23:38,860
Just gotta finish gaming now.

2204
02:23:41,460 --> 02:23:42,060
Wee!

2205
02:23:42,460 --> 02:23:43,740
Oh my gosh, ooh.

2206
02:23:44,520 --> 02:23:45,500
It's gonna be risky.

2207
02:23:46,420 --> 02:23:48,160
Okay, I got that.

2208
02:23:48,440 --> 02:23:49,020
Okay, I'm in.

2209
02:23:49,580 --> 02:23:50,360
I'm fucking in.

2210
02:23:50,620 --> 02:23:51,780
I don't have to worry now.

2211
02:23:52,840 --> 02:23:53,440
Wee!

2212
02:23:54,640 --> 02:23:55,720
I already got 70.

2213
02:23:55,880 --> 02:23:57,320
Oh, that was scary.

2214
02:23:58,000 --> 02:23:59,220
I wasn't paying attention there.

2215
02:23:59,780 --> 02:24:00,020
It's okay.

2216
02:24:00,700 --> 02:24:01,180
We're set.

2217
02:24:02,800 --> 02:24:03,140
Yay!

2218
02:24:05,100 --> 02:24:06,180
I'm gaming.

2219
02:24:06,440 --> 02:24:07,680
Gotta work on those brain cells.

2220
02:24:08,440 --> 02:24:09,680
The library map!

2221
02:24:10,140 --> 02:24:10,880
I see!

2222
02:24:11,940 --> 02:24:12,780
See the exits?

2223
02:24:13,220 --> 02:24:14,680
They're right across from one another.

2224
02:24:15,100 --> 02:24:16,380
A straight path.

2225
02:24:17,160 --> 02:24:18,700
The shadow walked down the straight path.

2226
02:24:19,100 --> 02:24:19,620
There's a way.

2227
02:24:19,760 --> 02:24:21,880
SPO and shadow couldn't have seen one.

2228
02:24:21,980 --> 02:24:22,560
Wait, what?

2229
02:24:23,560 --> 02:24:25,140
Oh, I guess if he sat there.

2230
02:24:25,880 --> 02:24:26,440
Over here.

2231
02:24:26,600 --> 02:24:27,880
And then he goes this way.

2232
02:24:28,360 --> 02:24:30,140
Yeah, you just need to sit on that one chair.

2233
02:24:31,320 --> 02:24:31,840
Or here.

2234
02:24:32,360 --> 02:24:33,000
No, no, here.

2235
02:24:33,440 --> 02:24:36,660
Looks like you have to point out exactly where on the map.

2236
02:24:37,080 --> 02:24:37,940
Map, map, map.

2237
02:24:39,040 --> 02:24:39,960
You mean...

2238
02:24:40,140 --> 02:24:44,640
Where could Espef been foreshadowed to not see him?

2239
02:24:44,700 --> 02:24:45,980
Oh, here.

2240
02:24:48,060 --> 02:24:48,400
Here.

2241
02:24:49,400 --> 02:24:49,720
Interesting.

2242
02:24:50,340 --> 02:24:51,240
That's where I was sitting.

2243
02:24:51,260 --> 02:24:53,580
Oh, I thought it was like Espeo that not see him.

2244
02:24:53,860 --> 02:24:56,100
Okay, I thought he meant Espeo.

2245
02:24:56,360 --> 02:24:56,760
Okay.

2246
02:24:58,700 --> 02:25:03,320
And then I read, oh, where could he sit foreshadowed to not
see him?

2247
02:25:03,880 --> 02:25:04,220
Interesting.

2248
02:25:04,740 --> 02:25:06,280
That's where I was sitting reading my book.

2249
02:25:06,540 --> 02:25:08,860
Yeah, of course, that's exactly where.

2250
02:25:10,000 --> 02:25:10,440
this.

2251
02:25:11,000 --> 02:25:14,780
When I returned from the saloon car, Espio was in the same
spot.

2252
02:25:16,300 --> 02:25:19,940
I made him like, I made Vector like dumber and dumber the
more I voiced him.

2253
02:25:20,540 --> 02:25:21,540
That confirms it then.

2254
02:25:21,900 --> 02:25:25,140
You see, Shadow and Espio couldn't have seen anyone there
from the spot.

2255
02:25:26,400 --> 02:25:27,940
Because Hippocus is in the way.

2256
02:25:28,320 --> 02:25:30,820
I can't believe I'd suck my neck out of it for you, Tiz.

2257
02:25:31,380 --> 02:25:32,320
I can't believe it.

2258
02:25:32,660 --> 02:25:34,940
You fucking made an innocent chameleon cry.

2259
02:25:35,620 --> 02:25:37,540
I suck my neck for you, man.

2260
02:25:37,700 --> 02:25:38,820
I defended you.

2261
02:25:39,740 --> 02:25:43,460
There's No way Shadow could have seen Espio or vice versa.

2262
02:25:44,580 --> 02:25:46,180
It makes a lot of sense why.

2263
02:25:46,400 --> 02:25:48,600
You never mentioned Shadow's return, Espio.

2264
02:25:50,380 --> 02:25:52,000
There's just no way you had seen him.

2265
02:25:52,640 --> 02:25:54,060
Camp, I defended you!

2266
02:25:55,820 --> 02:25:58,660
I can't believe it isn't a proven guilty.

2267
02:26:00,140 --> 02:26:02,980
I apologize for losing my call back there.

2268
02:26:03,940 --> 02:26:06,840
I felt like I was grasping despite telling the truth.

2269
02:26:08,080 --> 02:26:09,620
I'm glad you all believe me now.

2270
02:26:10,300 --> 02:26:14,140
Your alibi isn't the most airtight, but I have no further
points.

2271
02:26:14,740 --> 02:26:17,300
I'm sorry I gave you a trauma a little bit.

2272
02:26:18,700 --> 02:26:21,300
Thank you both for answering all our questions.

2273
02:26:22,460 --> 02:26:23,140
We did it.

2274
02:26:23,440 --> 02:26:25,820
Another pair of alibis validated.

2275
02:26:26,960 --> 02:26:27,280
Yeah!

2276
02:26:27,860 --> 02:26:29,040
Who the fuck did it?

2277
02:26:30,220 --> 02:26:32,320
Too many locked doors to worry about.

2278
02:26:32,560 --> 02:26:33,800
I'm glad everything's straight.

2279
02:26:33,880 --> 02:26:34,800
Okay, I bet you.

2280
02:26:35,140 --> 02:26:39,640
Nobody did anything and Sonic just got overdosed with like
chili dogs.

2281
02:26:40,140 --> 02:26:49,300
you i swear okay um quote me on this right now nobody did
anything and sonic just ate too many chili dogs and passed

2282
02:26:49,300 --> 02:27:06,040
out i'm exhausted i'm gonna crash here for a bit those
chairs are so comfy likewise i could use a breather sadly

2283
02:27:06,040 --> 02:27:12,500
our work isn't done i have plenty of questions for Rouge and
especially Shad.

2284
02:27:12,640 --> 02:27:13,220
What about Blaze?

2285
02:27:13,360 --> 02:27:15,160
No one ever said anything about Blaze.

2286
02:27:15,960 --> 02:27:24,420
Like I I like how no one said like she's so irrelevant that
no one has said anything about Blaze or like Blaze has done

2287
02:27:24,420 --> 02:27:25,560
anything at all.

2288
02:27:26,200 --> 02:27:32,100
Amy must have kept it open when she passed through earlier
then that's our cue to leave.

2289
02:27:32,520 --> 02:27:34,660
See you later vector and SPO.

2290
02:27:35,920 --> 02:27:48,980
Give them heck and if you need any meat I'll keep my poetry
sharp for you both A murder is on the loose While doors keep

2291
02:27:48,980 --> 02:28:03,740
getting locked Tick, tick, tick, tock Goes the clock While
our heroes are in The caboose I'm blue, badaddy, badaboo At

2292
02:28:03,740 --> 02:28:12,240
this point I'm feeling pretty confident In our detective
abilities We're really doing this Come on, Doki.

2293
02:28:12,520 --> 02:28:14,580
Doki Meadow, FPS V-Tube.

2294
02:28:14,980 --> 02:28:16,020
Let's see what's next.

2295
02:28:17,400 --> 02:28:17,480
Coming!

2296
02:28:18,680 --> 02:28:19,380
Alright, let's see.

2297
02:28:20,180 --> 02:28:21,460
Yeah, I'm ready to go.

2298
02:28:22,440 --> 02:28:23,700
The mystery cause.

2299
02:28:25,140 --> 02:28:26,700
Alright, is Amy gonna be in a casino?

2300
02:28:27,540 --> 02:28:27,840
Wait!

2301
02:28:28,160 --> 02:28:29,860
Oh my god, he has a mustache!

2302
02:28:30,120 --> 02:28:31,540
I thought they were all children!

2303
02:28:35,750 --> 02:28:36,850
What the fuck?

2304
02:28:38,170 --> 02:28:40,110
Oh, this stuff is getting heavy.

2305
02:28:41,990 --> 02:28:42,990
Don't need.

2306
02:28:44,350 --> 02:28:45,670
Rouge, there you are.

2307
02:28:46,110 --> 02:28:47,890
We have a lot of things to say to you.

2308
02:28:49,470 --> 02:28:55,610
We visited every train car so far and everyone said they've
seen you wandering about.

2309
02:28:56,630 --> 02:28:58,510
It's high time you told us why.

2310
02:28:59,630 --> 02:29:00,490
My, my.

2311
02:29:00,970 --> 02:29:03,170
Talk about a warm welcome.

2312
02:29:04,510 --> 02:29:05,730
Quit to that point.

2313
02:29:06,430 --> 02:29:07,890
Aren't you, darling?

2314
02:29:10,050 --> 02:29:14,290
I see you brought the microwave master with you.

2315
02:29:14,690 --> 02:29:15,890
Oh, master?

2316
02:29:17,750 --> 02:29:20,250
Oh, please don't let that be my legacy, bro.

2317
02:29:20,370 --> 02:29:20,790
What the fuck?

2318
02:29:21,010 --> 02:29:22,250
People will kill for that.

2319
02:29:23,210 --> 02:29:23,950
Tales is right.

2320
02:29:24,390 --> 02:29:26,410
Folks have brought you up a lot.

2321
02:29:26,730 --> 02:29:28,170
Care to explain?

2322
02:29:29,630 --> 02:29:30,030
Hmm.

2323
02:29:31,870 --> 02:29:33,310
Tell him, Rouge.

2324
02:29:33,890 --> 02:29:35,550
We're gonna need that help.

2325
02:29:37,390 --> 02:29:38,130
Oh my gosh.

2326
02:29:38,190 --> 02:29:39,410
She actually has a role.

2327
02:29:39,590 --> 02:29:40,930
She has...

2328
02:29:41,990 --> 02:29:49,670
Oh my god, guys, Blaze actually talks and has a role in this
game.

2329
02:29:52,390 --> 02:29:58,310
Alright, I've been hunting for a treasure, rumored to be
stored here on the train.

2330
02:29:59,090 --> 02:30:00,470
I knew it, I knew it was treasure.

2331
02:30:00,650 --> 02:30:01,350
It's always something.

2332
02:30:01,870 --> 02:30:02,910
It's always about money.

2333
02:30:04,890 --> 02:30:06,910
I shouldn't tell me about treasure in the interview.

2334
02:30:08,710 --> 02:30:11,970
Since I'm a part business tycoon...

2335
02:30:11,990 --> 02:30:15,350
Part purveyor of fine collectibles.

2336
02:30:15,930 --> 02:30:17,190
I knew how to find it.

2337
02:30:18,290 --> 02:30:20,350
Tell him what it is, Rouge.

2338
02:30:21,470 --> 02:30:21,810
All right.

2339
02:30:22,730 --> 02:30:24,450
Well, it's a...

2340
02:30:24,450 --> 02:30:26,430
Oh my god, a Faberge cake.

2341
02:30:26,530 --> 02:30:27,790
I don't understand those.

2342
02:30:28,370 --> 02:30:32,110
Like, people have actually spent, like, millions on Faberge
eggs.

2343
02:30:32,330 --> 02:30:33,510
But, like, I don't understand.

2344
02:30:33,910 --> 02:30:36,770
It's just, like, it's just, like, a bedazzled egg.

2345
02:30:38,490 --> 02:30:41,890
It's just a fucking bedazzled egg.

2346
02:30:41,990 --> 02:30:43,970
Like, I don't understand.

2347
02:30:44,250 --> 02:30:45,550
Why are they so popular?

2348
02:30:46,990 --> 02:30:47,630
Where are those?

2349
02:30:47,910 --> 02:30:51,430
What I said, eggs with, like, fucking jewelry on it.

2350
02:30:52,770 --> 02:30:55,030
It's a really fucking fancy egg.

2351
02:30:55,710 --> 02:30:57,690
Wow, that sounds extravagant.

2352
02:31:00,070 --> 02:31:04,490
Please, don't tell me you accepted Amy's birthday invite
only to find that egg.

2353
02:31:04,610 --> 02:31:05,890
Don't you care about Amy?

2354
02:31:06,710 --> 02:31:09,410
The girl that clearly has a lot of friends?

2355
02:31:10,950 --> 02:31:11,830
Sorry, Amy.

2356
02:31:11,990 --> 02:31:25,870
A woman can have multiple goals I gave Amy her birthday
present already So everything's well taken care of Wait, is

2357
02:31:25,870 --> 02:31:26,930
Blaze French?

2358
02:31:28,770 --> 02:31:36,750
She wrote me in on the hunting media Okay, I can't do a
French accent either Wee-wee She wrote me Wee-wee,

2359
02:31:36,770 --> 02:31:48,070
mademoiselle She wrote me in on the hunting media I stayed
here while she searched the train cars for clues

2360
02:31:51,230 --> 02:32:02,930
I deduced that the Faberge Chaos eggs is here in this train
car locked in a safe wait so the treasure is real it's

2361
02:32:02,930 --> 02:32:16,290

written right on it a score of a lifetime like the train's

2363
02:32:25,270 --> 02:32:38,910

we need to plan to get that car to use the elevator and our

2369
02:33:37,610 --> 02:33:40,210
Chance of success grows with everyone's help.

2370
02:33:40,890 --> 02:33:43,730
So who wants to help you steal the Faber-Jay Chow egg?

2371
02:33:44,810 --> 02:33:46,950
Blaze, you don't have a problem with this?

2372
02:33:47,810 --> 02:33:48,850
I see no issue here.

2373
02:33:49,590 --> 02:33:51,770
Sounds like a fine business venture.

2374
02:33:53,270 --> 02:33:56,690
Her lower card must be influencing her decisions here.

2375
02:33:57,870 --> 02:34:01,650
Either that, breaking the rules must be refreshing for a
princess.

2376
02:34:04,770 --> 02:34:06,490
Joki Mado FPS V2.

2377
02:34:07,610 --> 02:34:09,790
Do you have an opinion on this?

2378
02:34:10,130 --> 02:34:11,550
Do not kick the chow.

2379
02:34:11,890 --> 02:34:12,830
Kick the chow!

2380
02:34:14,050 --> 02:34:16,810
They become rare if you kick the chow.

2381
02:34:17,190 --> 02:34:18,590
They turn into evil chows.

2382
02:34:18,910 --> 02:34:19,970
They're rare.

2383
02:34:22,770 --> 02:34:25,350
Stealing is for squares.

2384
02:34:26,530 --> 02:34:28,190
Damn, I'm so cool.

2385
02:34:32,750 --> 02:34:36,090
Well, you say that stealing is for squares.

2386
02:34:36,870 --> 02:34:51,750
I think the only square here is you microwave master I must
admit that wasn't the coolest thing I'm so cool so cool I

2387
02:34:51,750 --> 02:35:03,050
heard someone say no my cool and mysterious reputation it's
crumbling all right all right I'm in I'll help I'm hope I'll

2388
02:35:03,050 --> 02:35:08,150
be a square the women say I wasn't cool, so I got
peer-pressured.

2389
02:35:09,070 --> 02:35:12,230
I suppose if both Blaze and Doki Meadow FBS V2 are in.

2390
02:35:13,050 --> 02:35:15,310
Okay, let's get that Faber J chowting.

2391
02:35:17,230 --> 02:35:18,510
That's the ticket.

2392
02:35:19,230 --> 02:35:22,090
Happy to have you both on the team.

2393
02:35:22,450 --> 02:35:22,750
Chew.

2394
02:35:24,470 --> 02:35:26,530
Now, we must plan.

2395
02:35:27,910 --> 02:35:29,570
Oh my god, we're doing a heist.

2396
02:35:29,670 --> 02:35:30,310
It's heist time.

2397
02:35:30,770 --> 02:35:31,350
Oh boy.

2398
02:35:31,570 --> 02:35:33,290
What have we gotten ourselves into?

2399
02:35:35,190 --> 02:35:38,590
Chow Egg room is behind a locked elevator door.

2400
02:35:39,030 --> 02:35:40,790
The security guard has the access key.

2401
02:35:41,070 --> 02:35:43,150
Do we kick the guard?

2402
02:35:44,290 --> 02:35:45,070
Attack him!

2403
02:35:45,850 --> 02:35:48,310
I can't say I'm comfortable attacking Chow.

2404
02:35:49,070 --> 02:35:51,090
Let's keep bodies to the minimum, shall we?

2405
02:35:51,670 --> 02:35:53,250
Less fun, but I agree.

2406
02:35:53,550 --> 02:35:55,170
Why would you agree with that, Rouge?

2407
02:35:55,970 --> 02:35:57,330
You have a gun!

2408
02:35:58,490 --> 02:35:59,630
Access to Fabricé.

2409
02:35:59,770 --> 02:36:01,410
Okay, I guess we don't...

2410
02:36:01,410 --> 02:36:02,890
I don't attack the guard.

2411
02:36:03,490 --> 02:36:05,170
Do we distract...

2412
02:36:05,190 --> 02:36:15,590
the guard distract a guard what do we distract them by i
guess we can like bribe anyone have anything we use for a

2413

2414
02:36:24,730 --> 02:36:33,370

dad to buy you more things me bribing isn't a way to go we

2415
02:36:33,370 --> 02:36:42,430
have oh my god but there the easiest choices bribing and
attacking distracting them perfect we're all charming enough

2416
02:36:42,430 --> 02:36:50,350
for that to work that was actually a really nice thing to
say doki made our fps vtube is everything okay i've never

2417
02:36:50,350 --> 02:36:55,750

2420
02:37:28,190 --> 02:37:30,330

2421
02:37:35,130 --> 02:37:35,810
she is.

2422
02:37:36,150 --> 02:37:37,030
I'm fully committing.

2423
02:37:37,490 --> 02:37:38,430
She doesn't wear

2424
02:37:41,550 --> 02:37:44,770
oh Chick-buck squirrel.

2425
02:37:45,270 --> 02:37:46,270
I was half in.

2426
02:37:46,770 --> 02:37:48,830
I was half right.

2427
02:37:51,610 --> 02:37:53,270
Wait, she's isn't cat in?

2428
02:37:53,810 --> 02:37:56,030
Is it because she doesn't wear pants?

2429
02:37:56,510 --> 02:37:59,690
But they don't fucking tails doesn't wear pants.

2430
02:38:02,470 --> 02:38:03,270
Alright.

2431
02:38:04,310 --> 02:38:04,810
Uh-huh.

2432
02:38:05,590 --> 02:38:09,530
If I'm going to be in a casino, my poker face needs work.

2433
02:38:11,570 --> 02:38:12,630
Who's distracting the suit?

2434
02:38:12,790 --> 02:38:13,990
Rouge wore pants?

2435
02:38:14,130 --> 02:38:15,290
Look, that's pants.

2436
02:38:16,250 --> 02:38:17,350
Who's distracting?

2437
02:38:17,490 --> 02:38:18,690
Well, obviously Rouge, right?

2438
02:38:20,190 --> 02:38:20,790
Rouge.

2439
02:38:21,090 --> 02:38:22,850
Of course I'll distract them.

2440
02:38:23,350 --> 02:38:26,290
Who could resist my benjamin charms?

2441
02:38:27,890 --> 02:38:31,090
I'm not sure how effective your charms would be on a chow.

2442
02:38:32,230 --> 02:38:34,270
Plus, your flight might prove useful.

2443
02:38:35,450 --> 02:38:38,310
bring the distraction makes sense.

2444
02:38:39,130 --> 02:38:39,470
Fair enough.

2445
02:38:39,630 --> 02:38:40,590
Let's think it over again.

2446
02:38:40,710 --> 02:38:42,290
Wait, who else is going to be distracting?

2447
02:38:44,610 --> 02:38:45,010
Tails?

2448
02:38:45,270 --> 02:38:46,950
I mean, he's useless in everything else, right?

2449
02:38:48,130 --> 02:38:49,570
Sure, I could be the distraction.

2450
02:38:50,530 --> 02:38:51,890
I don't like the way you set that.

2451
02:38:52,390 --> 02:38:54,150
Okay, then, Blaze!

2452
02:38:55,150 --> 02:38:56,250
Oh my god!

2453
02:38:57,350 --> 02:38:59,350
No, I really could do it!

2454
02:38:59,970 --> 02:39:00,630
Sorry, buddy.

2455
02:39:00,750 --> 02:39:01,630
I think you'll be better off.

2456
02:39:01,710 --> 02:39:02,710
Okay, Blaze!

2457
02:39:03,910 --> 02:39:04,310
Blaze!

2458
02:39:05,150 --> 02:39:06,410
I don't know.

2459
02:39:06,710 --> 02:39:09,010
They're all, like, distracting enough.

2460
02:39:11,190 --> 02:39:13,910
I think you can distract a guard, please.

2461
02:39:14,870 --> 02:39:18,650
In my life, I've never let a single person down.

2462
02:39:19,470 --> 02:39:20,550
I won't falter.

2463
02:39:22,190 --> 02:39:22,190
Great.

2464
02:39:22,850 --> 02:39:23,230
Her voice.

2465
02:39:23,330 --> 02:39:23,750
Oh, wait.

2466
02:39:23,870 --> 02:39:25,630
She was stoic this entire time.

2467
02:39:25,730 --> 02:39:26,170
Oh, fuck.

2468
02:39:26,510 --> 02:39:26,510
Okay.

2469
02:39:27,610 --> 02:39:29,710
Sorry, I gave her too much personality.

2470
02:39:30,530 --> 02:39:32,110
Her voice was so stoic.

2471
02:39:32,450 --> 02:39:33,190
I have chills.

2472
02:39:35,130 --> 02:39:45,310
guess yeah she looks like raven so i you're right she she
looks like raven so i should have fucking i should have like

2473
02:39:45,310 --> 02:40:01,650
known um well i trust her moving on what's the distraction
um uh about their partner and kids push a bunch of poker

2474
02:40:01,650 --> 02:40:12,770
chips to the floor content okay yeah i'll be like oh mr chow
i'm so dumb the claw machine is stuck

2475
02:40:19,230 --> 02:40:26,870
who puts that wait there's no claw machine in the casino
this worked great as a distraction let's continue the plan

2476
02:40:29,790 --> 02:40:32,970
Sumimasan, Mr. Chow.

2477
02:40:33,330 --> 02:40:37,930
When the card distracted, Rouge, how would you get the Axis
card?

2478
02:40:42,370 --> 02:40:44,070
Okay, pick their pocket.

2479
02:40:44,810 --> 02:40:47,450
I'll snatch the Axis key, no problem.

2480
02:40:47,970 --> 02:40:51,210
The Chow in uniform won't notice a thing.

2481
02:40:52,730 --> 02:40:54,690
Excellent, we can count on you, Rouge.

2482
02:40:56,870 --> 02:41:08,950
from them if you can help it no promises the card obtained
we need to get blaze out of there dokey made a fpsv tube

2483
02:41:08,950 --> 02:41:21,890
what's your plan um push the security card over here i'm
still not comfortable it's just a little push that child's

2484
02:41:21,890 --> 02:41:31,450
low to the ground it won't hurt them but what if they start
crying it bring unwanted attention to us was that accurate

2485
02:41:31,450 --> 02:41:41,770
was accurate to the blaze why is someone who cries so easily
a security guard anyway exactly decent point let's think of

2486
02:41:41,770 --> 02:41:57,430
something else fucking cowards you guys are cowards all
right say there's a drink without a coaster I can't think of

2487
02:41:57,430 --> 02:42:11,910
nothing worse Despicable I would never allow such a thing in
my kingdom The guard will go running immediately I'm sure of

2488
02:42:11,910 --> 02:42:23,590
it Great And with the guard distracted We'll all head to the
elevator And just like that We all make it to the elevator

2489
02:42:24,770 --> 02:42:37,170
side we i don't know sing victory alcapilla now that's a
proper victory oh no one last security measure we didn't

2490
02:42:37,170 --> 02:42:44,410
account for it wait what we missed the spouse route i'm
making sure they're like they're like rejected they reject

2491
02:42:44,410 --> 02:42:52,470
every i i chose like the worst idea because they actually
rejected every bad idea every amazing idea i had what do we

2492
02:42:52,470 --> 02:43:03,630
do about the mechanical arms attacking High five The end of
those arms are closed I'm not touching him My high fives

2493
02:43:03,630 --> 02:43:11,890
aren't giving away Willy Nilly They are to be cherished I
don't think my hines would survive A high five for them

2494
02:43:11,890 --> 02:43:13,130
unless we think this See?

2495
02:43:13,670 --> 02:43:26,990
It's such a great idea They never like my good ideas Why ask
for my opinion I'm like I should be able to disengage them.

2496
02:43:27,430 --> 02:43:28,670
I'll just need some time.

2497
02:43:29,470 --> 02:43:31,330
That leads us nicely to our next question.

2498
02:43:32,270 --> 02:43:32,790
Oh, no.

2499
02:43:33,210 --> 02:43:35,690
Tails is taking a while and the arms are tightening their
grip.

2500
02:43:35,790 --> 02:43:36,450
Oh, my God.

2501
02:43:36,550 --> 02:43:37,850
Am I getting choked?

2502
02:43:38,610 --> 02:43:42,350
Why am I the one getting choked?

2503
02:43:43,410 --> 02:43:44,350
What the fuck?

2504
02:43:45,450 --> 02:43:46,950
Everyone else is okay.

2505
02:43:49,830 --> 02:44:08,270
Um Um Cry Tails managed to do it Darling's I'm happy to say
This plan is perfect If everyone is ready It's time to

2506
02:44:08,270 --> 02:44:18,610
execute I'm ready Let's begin Alright let's see what's up
That elevator All right, let's do it.

2507
02:44:18,650 --> 02:44:19,290
Did I do it?

2508
02:44:21,270 --> 02:44:22,070
I did it.

2509
02:44:22,150 --> 02:44:22,370
Yeah.

2510
02:44:25,110 --> 02:44:25,750
Yay.

2511
02:44:29,090 --> 02:44:30,970
I did it.

2512
02:44:32,850 --> 02:44:36,110
I knew the plan would go without a hitch.

2513
02:44:36,270 --> 02:44:37,390
So fucking easy.

2514
02:44:38,650 --> 02:44:41,970
We couldn't have made it this far without you both.

2515
02:44:42,470 --> 02:44:43,810
You have my gratitude.

2516
02:44:44,950 --> 02:44:46,930
All right, planning beforehand was very thorough.

2517
02:44:46,950 --> 02:44:56,370
I must admit And it was executed to perfection Enough
chatter Now we claim our real prize I have the safe code

2518
02:44:56,370 --> 02:45:09,630
right here On these blueprints Let's claim our Fabricier
Chow egg Alright So this one No question Let's got to be a

2519
02:45:09,630 --> 02:45:17,610
safe with our treasure Entering the code on the blueprints
Entering the code on the blueprints And find out Rouge And

2520
02:45:17,610 --> 02:45:18,390
it's sweetheart.

2521
02:45:19,030 --> 02:45:19,430
Let's see.

2522
02:45:19,830 --> 02:45:22,470
23, 04, 01.

2523
02:45:23,530 --> 02:45:23,930
Yeah!

2524
02:45:27,190 --> 02:45:28,650
What if it hatches?

2525
02:45:29,350 --> 02:45:30,130
It's here.

2526
02:45:30,590 --> 02:45:32,190
I have it.

2527
02:45:33,830 --> 02:45:35,030
It's so ugly.

2528
02:45:35,870 --> 02:45:38,630
All right, before anyone else is seen, let's get it out of
here.

2529
02:45:39,530 --> 02:45:40,850
Hold on, kiddo.

2530
02:45:41,170 --> 02:45:42,830
It can't be so hasty.

2531
02:45:43,270 --> 02:45:46,390
You truly think that's all there is to this egg?

2532
02:45:47,090 --> 02:45:48,370
The egg is real.

2533
02:45:48,510 --> 02:45:53,490
I don't know if there are secrets whatsoever.

2534
02:45:54,910 --> 02:45:56,090
Rouge, spit it out.

2535
02:45:56,570 --> 02:45:57,390
What are you hiding?

2536
02:45:58,510 --> 02:46:00,490
Only three of these eggs were ever made.

2537
02:46:01,050 --> 02:46:04,530
Each hiding their own individual secret.

2538
02:46:05,230 --> 02:46:06,130
I like secrets.

2539
02:46:06,890 --> 02:46:13,510
No one knows the secret because anyone who's opened one of
these has never lived to tell their tale.

2540
02:46:15,370 --> 02:46:18,390
Doki made our FPS VTube open it.

2541
02:46:18,510 --> 02:46:20,710
You can open the egg?

2542
02:46:21,010 --> 02:46:22,250
Yes, it's a fucking egg.

2543
02:46:22,390 --> 02:46:24,650
Do you not see the gold thing right here?

2544
02:46:25,210 --> 02:46:26,350
Oh my god, Tails.

2545
02:46:26,830 --> 02:46:30,310
You're like a genius, but yet you're so fucking stupid
sometimes.

2546
02:46:31,190 --> 02:46:32,390
Yeah, sure it can.

2547
02:46:32,930 --> 02:46:35,510
And all of you will bear witness to its secret.

2548
02:46:36,970 --> 02:46:38,870
Bougie, I don't know if you should.

2549
02:46:39,930 --> 02:46:42,870
All you need to do is twist it.

2550
02:46:43,950 --> 02:46:44,570
You won't.

2551
02:46:45,530 --> 02:46:47,430
Tick, tick, tick, tick.

2552
02:46:48,510 --> 02:46:50,850
Oh, maybe that's why no one fucking...

2553
02:46:50,850 --> 02:46:53,550
No one fucking lived because they died.

2554
02:46:53,690 --> 02:46:54,430
Is this a bomb?

2555
02:46:55,670 --> 02:46:56,030
Huh?

2556
02:46:56,470 --> 02:46:58,650
Why do we have a bomb on a fucking train?

2557
02:47:00,090 --> 02:47:04,070
Wait, I thought like the robot arms made sure we don't have
bombs in this train.

2558
02:47:05,030 --> 02:47:05,770
Uh-oh.

2559
02:47:07,190 --> 02:47:12,970
There's just no one lived to tell the egg's secret because
each egg is a bomb.

2560
02:47:14,790 --> 02:47:15,090
Huh?

2561
02:47:15,910 --> 02:47:17,310
I think you're onto something, kid.

2562
02:47:17,730 --> 02:47:18,870
It sure sounds like a bomb.

2563
02:47:20,010 --> 02:47:22,790
We need to dispose of that egg now.

2564
02:47:23,190 --> 02:47:24,330
Wait, we throw in a save.

2565
02:47:24,470 --> 02:47:25,010
It'll be fine.

2566
02:47:25,150 --> 02:47:26,250
It's like bomb proof.

2567
02:47:27,330 --> 02:47:29,150
Dispose of it after a hard work?

2568
02:47:30,390 --> 02:47:30,430
Rouge.

2569
02:47:36,790 --> 02:47:37,530
Fine, fine.

2570
02:47:38,010 --> 02:47:38,890
But what do we do?

2571
02:47:39,550 --> 02:47:41,550
Where do I put this thing?

2572
02:47:43,050 --> 02:47:45,150
Guys, enough talking.

2573
02:47:45,710 --> 02:47:47,590
Just fucking throw that bomb!

2574
02:47:48,510 --> 02:47:50,330
Why are we still talking?

2575
02:47:52,050 --> 02:47:53,870
That's an excellent question.

2576
02:47:54,450 --> 02:47:55,750
What do we do with it?

2577
02:47:56,290 --> 02:47:56,330
Whoa!

2578
02:48:00,110 --> 02:48:02,590
Oh my god, there's a lot of...

2579
02:48:02,590 --> 02:48:04,590
Tell the egg to stop.

2580
02:48:05,230 --> 02:48:05,430
Yeah.

2581
02:48:06,410 --> 02:48:06,770
Stop.

2582
02:48:09,890 --> 02:48:11,170
That did nothing.

2583
02:48:11,610 --> 02:48:13,390
I can't believe I just did that.

2584
02:48:16,710 --> 02:48:18,410
Okay, take one for the team.

2585
02:48:18,510 --> 02:48:19,290
Let's do it.

2586
02:48:19,530 --> 02:48:19,990
I'm going to do it.

2587
02:48:20,190 --> 02:48:20,950
Give it to me.

2588
02:48:21,190 --> 02:48:22,530
I'm going to be a hero.

2589
02:48:24,110 --> 02:48:25,250
Get away from his far spot.

2590
02:48:25,490 --> 02:48:28,410
Just remember me as I am a hero.

2591
02:48:30,430 --> 02:48:31,410
Don't keep me though.

2592
02:48:31,470 --> 02:48:32,170
At PSV too.

2593
02:48:32,210 --> 02:48:33,410
We won't let you do it.

2594
02:48:34,270 --> 02:48:36,010
I mean, that's what they want.

2595
02:48:36,310 --> 02:48:38,990
Who are we to stop the microwave?

2596
02:48:39,210 --> 02:48:41,710
Kids obviously not going to sacrifice themselves.

2597
02:48:42,250 --> 02:48:45,010
Their body's far too scrawny to contain.

2598
02:48:45,090 --> 02:48:47,070
Oh, just because I'm a tomato.

2599
02:48:48,250 --> 02:48:56,110
Doesn't mean I won't be able to shield us from the fucking
blast True Let's think of something else quickly.

2600
02:48:56,570 --> 02:48:59,030
Okay, clearly clearly it doesn't work.

2601
02:48:59,430 --> 02:49:02,550
Okay, have blaze set to stomp on the egg

2602
02:49:05,810 --> 02:49:13,190
Okay, okay throw it lock it in the safe quick put the egg
back Rouge It's fine.

2603
02:49:13,370 --> 02:49:18,550
It's going back in Huh Hells, the safe won't lock.

2604
02:49:18,950 --> 02:49:20,970
The door's staying open.

2605
02:49:22,350 --> 02:49:23,410
Close the door and twist the dial.

2606
02:49:24,330 --> 02:49:25,250
I obviously am.

2607
02:49:25,590 --> 02:49:27,790
There must be some weird way to relock the door.

2608
02:49:28,790 --> 02:49:30,810
Please, there's no other buttons or dials.

2609
02:49:30,850 --> 02:49:31,710
How are you supposed to?

2610
02:49:32,310 --> 02:49:34,010
Don't have time to mess with this.

2611
02:49:34,190 --> 02:49:35,310
Think of something else.

2612
02:49:35,830 --> 02:49:36,950
Oh my god, it wasn't that.

2613
02:49:37,110 --> 02:49:38,190
That seemed like the...

2614
02:49:38,190 --> 02:49:39,110
Oh, it's just a mistake.

2615
02:49:39,290 --> 02:49:39,930
Let's fuck it.

2616
02:49:40,130 --> 02:49:41,070
If we die, we die.

2617
02:49:41,950 --> 02:49:42,990
Are you insane?

2618
02:49:43,590 --> 02:49:44,530
Do you want to sub...

2619
02:49:44,530 --> 02:49:45,990
If we die, we die.

2620
02:49:47,670 --> 02:50:02,210
We need to dispose at the mom Doki Mado FPS VTube That is
our goal Listen, I get that But, hear me out What if the egg

2621
02:50:02,210 --> 02:50:16,370
Isn't a bomb Wait, that's right Doki Mado FPS VTube I think
you're on to something Oh my god, I was cooking What's right

2622
02:50:16,370 --> 02:50:23,730
spit it out kiddo we don't have any time okay we clear that
a lot of time there was a lot of options like we had so much

2623
02:50:23,730 --> 02:50:31,070
fucking time sorry it's just espio did say something
interesting when we quizzed him about the train's manual

2624
02:50:31,070 --> 02:50:39,450
wait we did what do you say um what's efficient extremely
accurate technology and saw saw to assist in keeping the

2625
02:50:39,450 --> 02:50:49,170
train spotless robotic wait are you of choice, whatever page
I asked for.

2626
02:50:50,830 --> 02:50:52,930
They can perform a variety of tasks.

2627
02:50:52,990 --> 02:50:53,850
Yeah, I said that!

2628
02:50:54,330 --> 02:50:55,070
I remember.

2629
02:50:55,270 --> 02:50:59,790
I was like, when the robotic arms know about the fucking
bomb, it can't be a bomb.

2630
02:50:59,890 --> 02:51:00,450
I knew it.

2631
02:51:00,470 --> 02:51:01,230
I called it.

2632
02:51:01,330 --> 02:51:02,030
I was so smart.

2633
02:51:03,630 --> 02:51:05,630
I told you I remember things.

2634
02:51:06,390 --> 02:51:07,250
Those robotic arms.

2635
02:51:07,510 --> 02:51:08,570
In fact, Texas and the elevator.

2636
02:51:08,990 --> 02:51:10,750
It seems to have a lot of functions here on the train.

2637
02:51:11,990 --> 02:51:12,870
I remembered.

2638
02:51:13,110 --> 02:51:13,510
I remembered.

2639
02:51:14,290 --> 02:51:15,390
The bomb was brought into a train.

2640
02:51:16,010 --> 02:51:23,050
as a scraper shea egg the arms should have detected it and
would have allowed it on the only other person who knows the

2641
02:51:23,050 --> 02:51:29,030
coming going of the train is a conductor and he sure
wouldn't allow such a thing either wait that's me so we're

2642
02:51:29,030 --> 02:51:39,110
out of options sorry i personally hit you a little bit tails
i think we should wait and see what happens oh okay we wait

2643
02:51:40,970 --> 02:51:45,230
yeah i like i like the voice plays the most i think okay

2644
02:51:53,840 --> 02:51:54,880
Well, dig.

2645
02:51:55,480 --> 02:51:56,020
It opened.

2646
02:51:56,600 --> 02:51:57,120
It's hollow.

2647
02:51:57,740 --> 02:51:59,180
It's not a bomb at all.

2648
02:52:00,200 --> 02:52:01,960
You both really were onto something.

2649
02:52:02,500 --> 02:52:04,880
My, my.

2650
02:52:05,140 --> 02:52:07,360
That's one way to get the heart racing.

2651
02:52:08,460 --> 02:52:09,840
I'm completely relieved.

2652
02:52:10,220 --> 02:52:10,520
Oh, sorry.

2653
02:52:10,640 --> 02:52:12,220
That had a little bit too much emotion.

2654
02:52:12,880 --> 02:52:14,100
I'm completely relieved.

2655
02:52:16,400 --> 02:52:16,840
Sorry.

2656
02:52:17,280 --> 02:52:18,920
I had a little intonation in there.

2657
02:52:20,040 --> 02:52:20,780
My hunch was right.

2658
02:52:21,060 --> 02:52:21,320
Thankfully.

2659
02:52:25,870 --> 02:52:27,710
Ah, what's inside?

2660
02:52:28,670 --> 02:52:30,370
Oh, bling, bling!

2661
02:52:31,130 --> 02:52:32,210
Bedazzle chow!

2662
02:52:33,550 --> 02:52:36,630
Look at that sparkle and it's so heavy too!

2663
02:52:37,390 --> 02:52:41,870
Bling, bling, bling, bling, bling, bling, bling, bling,
bling, bling, bling.

2664
02:52:42,190 --> 02:52:48,930
The final secret to the Faberge Chao Egg is a chao covered
in gems!

2665
02:52:50,070 --> 02:52:51,690
That's a bedazzle chow!

2666
02:52:54,490 --> 02:53:03,850
It's Equisite It's Revolutionary And it's worth a lot of
money Is she drooling over a sparkly ornament?

2667
02:53:05,110 --> 02:53:14,370
I must admit It is stunning She said no one lived to tell
the Fabergé Child Egg Secret I wonder why Why if the egg

2668
02:53:14,370 --> 02:53:21,070
wasn't a bomb Because they weren't as tough as us I don't
know Who cares?

2669
02:53:22,950 --> 02:53:32,390
What a precious treasure a beauty to behold maybe he
naturally died of old age and just kept the secret with them

2670
02:53:32,390 --> 02:53:45,490
no people keeping secrets no um as much fun as this has been
we should get out of here before we spot it good call let's

2671
02:53:45,490 --> 02:53:56,310
go is that it why not even have to interrogate them i mean
that's all No one seems to suspect anything.

2672
02:53:56,670 --> 02:53:59,530
And the security guard is back at their post.

2673
02:54:01,090 --> 02:54:03,910
Hope they subdued the drink coaster feeling okay.

2674
02:54:05,090 --> 02:54:07,250
Thank you both for your assistance.

2675
02:54:07,750 --> 02:54:10,590
That hunt was exactly the thrill I was seeking.

2676
02:54:11,210 --> 02:54:11,930
What about the murder?

2677
02:54:12,070 --> 02:54:13,810
Do we just not care about the murder anymore?

2678
02:54:15,050 --> 02:54:17,150
Sealing was strangely fun.

2679
02:54:18,030 --> 02:54:19,510
I prefer to never do it again.

2680
02:54:20,150 --> 02:54:20,930
Fucking pussy.

2681
02:54:22,210 --> 02:54:23,070
Now, Rouge.

2682
02:54:24,430 --> 02:54:26,110
Oh my god, what did she see?

2683
02:54:27,010 --> 02:54:28,410
She's completely absorbing that bedazzle.

2684
02:54:28,490 --> 02:54:30,170
Oh, she's still looking at the bedazzle, chow.

2685
02:54:31,610 --> 02:54:33,090
What is it, darling?

2686
02:54:33,990 --> 02:54:34,970
How about those blueprints?

2687
02:54:35,350 --> 02:54:37,950
Now that you're done with them, maybe we could take a look?

2688
02:54:38,730 --> 02:54:40,430
Well, I appreciate your assistance.

2689
02:54:41,170 --> 02:54:44,570
It's, as I said, finders, keepers.

2690
02:54:45,410 --> 02:54:49,070
I'll need them a little longer in case I missed any other
treasures.

2691
02:54:49,810 --> 02:54:53,310
But I promise to let you take a peek later.

2692
02:54:54,970 --> 02:54:59,670
I don't want to sound ungrateful, but I'm sure you get it,
sweetheart.

2693
02:55:01,470 --> 02:55:04,090
I hope she's talking to me and not the child.

2694
02:55:06,670 --> 02:55:12,010
You can't just add, sweetheart, to the end of a sentence to
make things better.

2695
02:55:13,590 --> 02:55:15,290
I don't think there's any reason of her.

2696
02:55:15,890 --> 02:55:17,310
She's more powerful than me.

2697
02:55:19,030 --> 02:55:21,750
Well, we'll get over your way for now, then.

2698
02:55:23,930 --> 02:55:25,690
We have a murder mystery to attend to.

2699
02:55:25,710 --> 02:55:28,150
You know, the one for Amy's birthday, guys.

2700
02:55:28,790 --> 02:55:29,350
You know.

2701
02:55:31,930 --> 02:55:36,370
Before you go, Shadow gave me and Rouge one of these.

2702
02:55:36,750 --> 02:55:38,170
He passed through earlier.

2703
02:55:39,050 --> 02:55:39,610
A key!

2704
02:55:40,730 --> 02:55:43,710
Let me unlock the door so you can continue forward.

2705
02:55:44,790 --> 02:55:47,250
You know, we've had a lot of people mention you, Rouge.

2706
02:55:47,810 --> 02:55:50,450
But we also have just as much suspicion about Shadow.

2707
02:55:52,870 --> 02:55:53,910
He's unpredictable.

2708
02:55:53,930 --> 02:55:55,930
That one.

2709
02:55:56,810 --> 02:55:58,350
Good luck to you.

2710
02:55:59,510 --> 02:56:00,510
The door is unlocked.

2711
02:56:00,910 --> 02:56:01,470
Both of you.

2712
02:56:01,630 --> 02:56:02,230
Stay safe.

2713
02:56:02,430 --> 02:56:03,150
Thanks again.

2714
02:56:03,510 --> 02:56:05,490
I like how, like, we're not even interrogating them.

2715
02:56:05,650 --> 02:56:07,350
We're just like, yep, they didn't do it.

2716
02:56:09,230 --> 02:56:10,890
The mystery continues.

2717
02:56:11,490 --> 02:56:12,770
They're just like, yep, all right.

2718
02:56:12,930 --> 02:56:13,830
Am I going to get one guide?

2719
02:56:14,670 --> 02:56:16,730
Tails, we must search the trash bin.

2720
02:56:18,750 --> 02:56:19,550
It's empty.

2721
02:56:20,010 --> 02:56:20,030
Oh!

2722
02:56:21,190 --> 02:56:21,970
Did I hear it all?

2723
02:56:23,930 --> 02:56:30,410
investigation even peeking in the trash see it's about
persistent stales my dad told me that when he met my mother

2724
02:56:30,410 --> 02:56:36,890
he would drive her to work two hours away every Tuesday with
flower from his garden she quickly agreed to a date and bro

2725
02:56:36,890 --> 02:56:46,190
that's fucking bro that's weird and when she arrived at the
restaurant she found two dozen roses waiting for her within

2726
02:56:46,190 --> 02:56:55,110
the year the two were married and it's about caring
dedication and persistence yes weather dose swads until she

2727
02:56:55,110 --> 02:57:14,690
says yes it's romance um that's very sweet but all that's in
the bin is a lollipop stick a lollipop stick yeah like the

2728
02:57:14,690 --> 02:57:19,350
leftover stick from a lollipop that's all there is Can't
believe I got one guide again.

2729
02:57:20,450 --> 02:57:21,790
Doki made up FPS VTube.

2730
02:57:22,090 --> 02:57:23,690
Doki made up FPS VTube.

2731
02:57:24,130 --> 02:57:24,910
Is everything okay?

2732
02:57:25,190 --> 02:57:27,110
Do you need to bring you a flower?

2733
02:57:28,150 --> 02:57:29,030
It's a clue!

2734
02:57:29,370 --> 02:57:29,950
Tails!

2735
02:57:30,290 --> 02:57:31,390
It's a clue!

2736
02:57:33,070 --> 02:57:34,510
You don't know that!

2737
02:57:35,150 --> 02:57:36,090
It's a clue!

2738
02:57:37,050 --> 02:57:37,830
Ooh, jackpot.

2739
02:57:38,530 --> 02:57:40,110
Oh, nice pinball!

2740
02:57:42,850 --> 02:57:44,290
Cheating, cheating, cheating.

2741
02:57:44,930 --> 02:57:45,770
Do you think I can cheat?

2742
02:57:46,710 --> 02:57:47,390
Park.

2743
02:57:48,470 --> 02:57:51,970
I like how we don't talk about Balin's Wonderland.

2744
02:57:52,390 --> 02:57:52,810
Wonderworld?

2745
02:57:53,150 --> 02:57:54,750
Hide, but...

2746
02:57:54,750 --> 02:57:55,510
Ready to get going?

2747
02:57:55,750 --> 02:57:56,450
Yeah, I am.

2748
02:57:57,390 --> 02:57:57,990
I am.

2749
02:57:58,110 --> 02:57:58,810
Let's find Shadow.

2750
02:57:59,090 --> 02:58:02,090
We're almost at the end of this murder mystery.

2751
02:58:03,310 --> 02:58:04,210
I can gamble?

2752
02:58:04,650 --> 02:58:05,610
Wait, I can gamble?

2753
02:58:06,590 --> 02:58:07,270
No!

2754
02:58:08,610 --> 02:58:10,730
You can play games?

2755
02:58:15,250 --> 02:58:16,990
The slots!

2756
02:58:17,890 --> 02:58:19,410
Take me back!

2757
02:58:20,290 --> 02:58:22,710
Oh no, no,

2758
02:58:25,880 --> 02:58:39,520
no, no, no, no, we couldn't gamble in front of the child.

2759
02:58:46,360 --> 02:58:49,640
We couldn't gamble in front of the child.

2760
02:58:50,420 --> 02:58:51,980
That was a good time to clean.

2761
02:58:52,120 --> 02:58:53,460
Any of my pockets.

2762
02:58:55,020 --> 02:58:56,540
I knew you weren't talking.

2763
02:58:57,020 --> 02:58:59,240
I knew exactly why you've been locking those doors.

2764
02:59:00,120 --> 02:59:03,020
Sorry to get a word in as you talk over me, man.

2765
02:59:04,200 --> 02:59:06,000
I have my reasons.

2766
02:59:07,580 --> 02:59:08,060
I...

2767
02:59:08,060 --> 02:59:09,840
No reason is convincing enough.

2768
02:59:10,060 --> 02:59:10,840
It's inconceivable.

2769
02:59:11,160 --> 02:59:11,980
What you did.

2770
02:59:12,940 --> 02:59:14,320
Hey, hey, hey, what's going on?

2771
02:59:14,400 --> 02:59:15,040
Hey, guys.

2772
02:59:15,500 --> 02:59:15,500
Hey.

2773
02:59:16,760 --> 02:59:16,940
Hmm.

2774
02:59:17,840 --> 02:59:19,380
I see you made it here, Tails.

2775
02:59:20,060 --> 02:59:29,320
But I didn't expect the Iron Chef as well we'll see what you
say when you microwave chili dogs delicious i'd like to know

2776
02:59:29,320 --> 02:59:40,760

well seems amy already knows so ask her

2777
02:59:43,940 --> 02:59:53,240

2778
02:59:53,240 --> 02:59:53,520
up.

2779
02:59:53,640 --> 02:59:54,120
With what?

2780
02:59:54,520 --> 02:59:55,660
You're just a locksmith.

2781
02:59:55,820 --> 02:59:57,000
You don't have any other job.

2782
02:59:57,360 --> 02:59:57,920
Be immersive.

2783
02:59:58,920 --> 02:59:59,480
An appointment.

2784
02:59:59,640 --> 03:00:01,160
Yeah, who wants to meet him here?

2785
03:00:02,160 --> 03:00:03,760
Well, Doki made a FPS V-Tube.

2786
03:00:04,200 --> 03:00:05,880
It seems like Shadow isn't going to talk.

2787
03:00:06,340 --> 03:00:07,820
Let's do some investigating.

2788
03:00:08,240 --> 03:00:09,960
He won't talk until his lawyer's here.

2789
03:00:10,800 --> 03:00:12,780
All right, ready to find some answers to his?

2790
03:00:13,780 --> 03:00:16,240
Indubitably, my dear Doki made a FPS V-Tube.

2791
03:00:17,100 --> 03:00:17,560
All right.

2792
03:00:18,580 --> 03:00:20,260
What will make him talk?

2793
03:00:21,060 --> 03:00:21,540
Oh.

2794
03:00:21,780 --> 03:00:23,700
Maybe he has a date.

2795
03:00:24,020 --> 03:00:25,280
Wait, why is your computer?

2796
03:00:28,100 --> 03:00:28,320
Tails.

2797
03:00:29,400 --> 03:00:29,660
No.

2798
03:00:30,920 --> 03:00:32,220
Tails, I think we should check the trash.

2799
03:00:33,260 --> 03:00:36,380
Every trash bin has been empty, Doki made of FPS V2.

2800
03:00:37,020 --> 03:00:38,740
And you've been disappointed every time.

2801
03:00:38,880 --> 03:00:40,240
No, it'll be different!

2802
03:00:40,680 --> 03:00:41,780
This time!

2803
03:00:42,260 --> 03:00:44,760
That one guy can't be right for once.

2804
03:00:45,040 --> 03:00:45,900
There's no way.

2805
03:00:46,360 --> 03:00:48,720
That one guy can't be right for once in his life.

2806
03:00:49,060 --> 03:00:50,060
Are you going to get sad again?

2807
03:00:50,120 --> 03:00:51,760
There's nothing in the trash bin, Doki.

2808
03:00:51,780 --> 03:00:53,420
made out of FPSV too.

2809
03:00:55,880 --> 03:00:57,680
There's always something in the trash bin.

2810
03:01:00,240 --> 03:01:02,100
Alright, let's check the trash bin.

2811
03:01:02,260 --> 03:01:02,620
This time.

2812
03:01:02,680 --> 03:01:03,020
This is it.

2813
03:01:03,160 --> 03:01:03,400
This is it.

2814
03:01:03,600 --> 03:01:04,340
This is the one guy.

2815
03:01:06,000 --> 03:01:06,480
What's this?

2816
03:01:11,300 --> 03:01:13,800
It's someone printed at the front page of a ticket website.

2817
03:01:14,240 --> 03:01:16,580
It's for the band Hot Honey.

2818
03:01:17,620 --> 03:01:18,060
Interesting.

2819
03:01:18,800 --> 03:01:20,560
Hot Honey is one of Amy's favorite bands.

2820
03:01:21,320 --> 03:01:21,760
Oh.

2821
03:01:21,780 --> 03:01:25,820
Oh my god, Shadow didn't get her a birthday present!

2822
03:01:26,980 --> 03:01:28,560
Let's add it to our inventory.

2823
03:01:29,400 --> 03:01:30,000
Shadow!

2824
03:01:31,340 --> 03:01:32,720
Are you sure this is just...

2825
03:01:32,720 --> 03:01:33,300
Trash?

2826
03:01:34,220 --> 03:01:35,980
That is Shadow.

2827
03:01:36,200 --> 03:01:37,120
I can't believe it.

2828
03:01:37,600 --> 03:01:38,960
I can't believe it, Shadow.

2829
03:01:39,200 --> 03:01:39,900
What the fuck?

2830
03:01:40,300 --> 03:01:41,680
You got it last minute?

2831
03:01:43,760 --> 03:01:46,540
There's always success if you check the trash bin.

2832
03:01:47,500 --> 03:01:49,360
Crump of paper is added to your inventory.

2833
03:01:49,840 --> 03:01:51,740
I can't believe it, Shadow.

2834
03:01:52,720 --> 03:02:02,660
you didn't fucking you didn't fucking get her a birthday
present until you're on the train better late than never

2835
03:02:05,740 --> 03:02:14,020
they don't they told us about this interview the lounge has
a computer complete with internet access for casual browsing

2836
03:02:14,020 --> 03:02:23,180
how lovely seems convenient it is a shame to be on the
computer and missing those gorgeous views though I feel like

2837
03:02:23,180 --> 03:02:25,060
if you're using it's 8 p.m.

2838
03:02:25,120 --> 03:02:39,120
It's dark You must really need to use it Yes, I My life is
now as a tomato Playing Sonic the Hedgehog Oh, I thought

keys A keyring must be shadows The locksmith It's

2840
03:02:51,260 --> 03:02:53,360
interesting There's only two keys.

2841
03:02:54,120 --> 03:02:56,540
I figured a locksmith would have a bunch.

2842
03:02:56,660 --> 03:02:58,240
Wait, doesn't give away all my keys, though?

2843
03:02:59,000 --> 03:03:00,680
Want to take it?

2844
03:03:02,040 --> 03:03:02,920
Rough times.

2845
03:03:03,020 --> 03:03:03,880
Thank you for the super chat.

2846
03:03:04,180 --> 03:03:04,300
Thank you.

2847
03:03:04,680 --> 03:03:04,980
Thank you.

2848
03:03:05,060 --> 03:03:06,480
Does that mean Amy's Latina?

2849
03:03:09,220 --> 03:03:11,040
Key ring is added to your inventory.

2850
03:03:12,180 --> 03:03:12,460
All right.

2851
03:03:12,680 --> 03:03:13,320
What else?

2852
03:03:15,160 --> 03:03:15,980
I'm going to check the door.

2853
03:03:17,100 --> 03:03:17,640
Oh, okay.

2854
03:03:18,080 --> 03:03:21,480
I thought like, uh, I thought like it would say something.

2855
03:03:21,780 --> 03:03:23,240
Can you open a wardrobe, please?

2856
03:03:25,380 --> 03:03:27,140
Wait, is there a reason I want me to do it?

2857
03:03:27,940 --> 03:03:29,100
What if something falls out?

2858
03:03:29,200 --> 03:03:30,640
Or worse, someone leaps out.

2859
03:03:30,860 --> 03:03:32,000
Or worse, it's a jump scare.

2860
03:03:32,720 --> 03:03:33,920
I just think you should do it.

2861
03:03:34,580 --> 03:03:36,040
All right, open a wardrobe.

2862
03:03:36,200 --> 03:03:37,700
Wait, Tails, yeah, do it.

2863
03:03:38,140 --> 03:03:39,020
Be a man.

2864
03:03:39,380 --> 03:03:40,240
Be a fox man.

2865
03:03:41,440 --> 03:03:42,280
All right.

2866
03:03:42,920 --> 03:03:43,800
Tough love.

2867
03:03:43,980 --> 03:03:44,760
I'll get it.

2868
03:03:44,840 --> 03:03:47,040
Today, you'll become a fox man, Tails.

2869
03:03:47,820 --> 03:03:49,340
Here goes nothing.

2870
03:03:50,540 --> 03:03:50,960
Ah!

2871
03:03:52,020 --> 03:03:53,880
Oh, just some sweaters.

2872
03:03:54,740 --> 03:03:54,740
See?

2873
03:03:55,040 --> 03:03:55,960
Not bad, huh?

2874
03:03:56,460 --> 03:03:57,800
Just dusty.

2875
03:04:01,140 --> 03:04:01,700
Boo!

2876
03:04:02,640 --> 03:04:02,900
Ah!

2877
03:04:04,240 --> 03:04:05,720
Sorry, I couldn't help it.

2878
03:04:06,260 --> 03:04:07,980
Yoki Meido, FPS VTuber.

2879
03:04:08,760 --> 03:04:09,480
I'm fragile.

2880
03:04:11,220 --> 03:04:12,420
Okay, clearly it wasn't...

2881
03:04:12,420 --> 03:04:13,320
Oh, wait, what's this?

2882
03:04:14,380 --> 03:04:15,400
Tells, you see this?

2883
03:04:15,680 --> 03:04:16,320
What was that?

2884
03:04:17,180 --> 03:04:17,900
A pullstring?

2885
03:04:18,840 --> 03:04:20,160
Yoki Meido, FPS VTuber.

2886
03:04:21,240 --> 03:04:21,560
What?

2887
03:04:21,780 --> 03:04:23,080
It's got to activate something.

2888
03:04:26,400 --> 03:04:27,640
There's a secret passage!

2889
03:04:29,040 --> 03:04:30,040
There's a full...

2890
03:04:30,040 --> 03:04:31,320
Okay, she didn't say that.

2891
03:04:32,100 --> 03:04:34,560
There's a full passageway back there.

2892
03:04:35,640 --> 03:04:37,700
Come on, we have to see where this leads.

2893
03:04:38,720 --> 03:04:39,320
He's curious.

2894
03:04:39,460 --> 03:04:41,260
This must mean something big.

2895
03:04:43,660 --> 03:04:44,280
Wait!

2896
03:04:44,660 --> 03:04:45,860
The library!

2897
03:04:47,480 --> 03:04:51,560
There's a secret passageway from the desk changes
everything!

2898
03:04:53,420 --> 03:04:58,860
Secret tunnel I don't believe it Wait, how the fuck does
that work?

2899
03:04:59,120 --> 03:05:01,640
Wait, wait, wait a minute Oh, does that...

2900
03:05:01,640 --> 03:05:04,020
Wait, wait a minute Wait.

2901
03:05:05,560 --> 03:05:06,840
How does...

2902
03:05:06,840 --> 03:05:07,160
Wait.

2903
03:05:08,420 --> 03:05:11,940
If the train is moving, like...

2904
03:05:11,940 --> 03:05:13,340
How does that work?

2905
03:05:14,440 --> 03:05:18,560
Like, wait, I'm a little confused now.

2906
03:05:22,100 --> 03:05:26,560
Yeah, but the train is moving, so like, how did the...

2907
03:05:31,000 --> 03:05:34,520
Alright, through the passageway before they spot us.

2908
03:05:39,160 --> 03:05:39,860
I'm confused.

2909
03:05:40,160 --> 03:05:41,040
My brain hurts now.

2910
03:05:41,200 --> 03:05:42,180
How the fuck, wait.

2911
03:05:47,020 --> 03:05:50,180
Wait, we need to add that to our inventory.

2912
03:05:52,380 --> 03:06:01,920
Hidden Paso Wait, I think I got the clues Yeah, it's time to
interrogate Shadow Ultimate life form It's time There's

2913
03:06:01,920 --> 03:06:10,880
nothing I can either help you There's nothing I can either
help Help with you I ask that you leave me be That stare So

2914
03:06:10,880 --> 03:06:19,740
cold Burr You know, we will get you We will get out of here
actually Don't keep made of FPS, B-Tube We certainly will

2915
03:06:19,740 --> 03:06:22,800
not Alright Can I take your aura?

2916
03:06:23,640 --> 03:06:25,200
I'll take you up on that coffee.

2917
03:06:26,080 --> 03:06:29,180
When I'm back in the dining car, I'll whip that right up.

2918
03:06:30,360 --> 03:06:31,060
Coffee on the train.

2919
03:06:32,060 --> 03:06:33,340
There's no better combination.

2920
03:06:35,440 --> 03:06:35,560
Hmm.

2921
03:06:37,280 --> 03:06:39,200
Some marshmallows will make it perfect.

2922
03:06:40,960 --> 03:06:41,300
Sure.

2923
03:06:42,340 --> 03:06:43,940
Because that's edgy.

2924
03:06:46,380 --> 03:06:48,340
Alright, let's actually interrogate him.

2925
03:06:49,880 --> 03:06:51,360
He likes it black.

2926
03:06:51,460 --> 03:06:52,900
Like his soul.

2927
03:06:55,480 --> 03:06:57,200
Shadow, we have questions for you.

2928
03:06:58,940 --> 03:07:01,100
For you three get out, I'm busy.

2929
03:07:02,460 --> 03:07:06,620
As I said, I have an appointment to attend to.

2930
03:07:07,640 --> 03:07:09,120
Sorry, but this is important.

2931
03:07:10,100 --> 03:07:12,780
Shadow, we question everyone on this train.

2932
03:07:13,200 --> 03:07:15,420
And every single person has mentioned running into you.

2933
03:07:16,820 --> 03:07:19,020
You've been locking every door in this train.

2934
03:07:19,740 --> 03:07:20,300
And...

2935
03:07:20,300 --> 03:07:21,340
And I know why.

2936
03:07:21,460 --> 03:07:21,980
Ah!

2937
03:07:25,320 --> 03:07:29,980
Pray tell why I was locking all the doors.

2938
03:07:31,460 --> 03:07:34,140
Time to reveal my hot tip.

2939
03:07:35,140 --> 03:07:39,280
Hope everyone ready for a scoop bound by yours truly.

2940
03:07:40,980 --> 03:07:41,660
We're ready.

2941
03:07:42,700 --> 03:07:48,860
According to the map, the next car is the conductor's car,
where Sonic was stationed.

2942
03:07:49,660 --> 03:07:51,440
This door right here in the lounge car.

2943
03:07:51,460 --> 03:07:54,400
is the only car that leads to the conductor's car.

2944
03:07:56,220 --> 03:08:00,680
So, Shadow was locking all the doors for one reason and one
reason alone.

2945
03:08:01,420 --> 03:08:04,060
To keep Sonic from escaping the conductor car.

2946
03:08:05,780 --> 03:08:08,560
So you think Shadow was trapping Sonic?

2947
03:08:09,480 --> 03:08:10,400
I sure do.

2948
03:08:10,940 --> 03:08:13,900
He locked the conductor's car, then locked all the others.

2949
03:08:14,200 --> 03:08:17,180
So one locked door wasn't suspicious.

2950
03:08:17,960 --> 03:08:18,860
I don't know, guys.

2951
03:08:19,000 --> 03:08:21,440
I think Amy's wrong, because it's never the first thing.

2952
03:08:23,780 --> 03:08:35,060
here conjecture you all get out and leave me be well my
source can back up who's my right source me source trust me

2953
03:08:35,060 --> 03:08:41,640
they remain anonymous but I think that source trust me

2954
03:08:45,020 --> 03:08:52,600
my source claims they never saw Sonic again after he went
into the conductor's car why Trust me, bro.

2955
03:08:53,580 --> 03:08:57,180
Because he was trapped and couldn't leave the conductor's
car.

2956
03:08:58,300 --> 03:08:59,520
Reckless speculation.

2957
03:09:00,540 --> 03:09:04,380
This is how you do your detective work, journalist.

2958
03:09:06,020 --> 03:09:07,440
Is the logic sound, though?

2959
03:09:07,520 --> 03:09:08,820
Was Shadow trapping?

2960
03:09:09,520 --> 03:09:11,160
Source, it's my birthday.

2961
03:09:13,020 --> 03:09:13,960
I'm right.

2962
03:09:14,060 --> 03:09:14,900
It's my birthday.

2963
03:09:15,960 --> 03:09:16,700
Happy birthday.

2964
03:09:18,000 --> 03:09:20,340
I'll play along and follow this train of logic, Amy.

2965
03:09:21,460 --> 03:09:23,840
Charlotte didn't lock the door to the Count Doctor's car?

2966
03:09:24,640 --> 03:09:25,500
Imprisoning Sonic?

2967
03:09:26,240 --> 03:09:28,080
Then how was Sonic found in the dining car?

2968
03:09:29,180 --> 03:09:29,660
Exactly.

2969
03:09:31,000 --> 03:09:32,620
I think Domain... Don't... Sorry.

2970
03:09:33,240 --> 03:09:37,940
Doki Mado FPS VTube and I can explain the car change,
however.

2971
03:09:40,920 --> 03:09:45,280
Doki Mado FPS VTube or what evidence do we have that shows
Sonic could have gotten to the dining car?

2972
03:09:45,420 --> 03:09:46,540
Well, obviously it's this.

2973
03:09:46,800 --> 03:09:47,760
Like, what else?

2974
03:09:48,860 --> 03:09:49,340
Like...

2975
03:09:49,340 --> 03:09:51,240
Or last week... Oh, yeah, it's this.

2976
03:09:51,720 --> 03:09:52,900
Oh, just cake.

2977
03:09:53,020 --> 03:09:54,520
Just get my thoughts in order.

2978
03:09:55,840 --> 03:09:55,840
Think.

2979
03:09:55,980 --> 03:09:56,840
Okay, I got it right.

2980
03:09:56,920 --> 03:09:57,600
It's think time.

2981
03:09:58,220 --> 03:09:58,760
Don't worry.

2982
03:09:59,200 --> 03:10:00,740
I'm just gonna play a little video game, guys.

2983
03:10:01,540 --> 03:10:03,100
Sorry, my mom said I can't pause this game.

2984
03:10:04,260 --> 03:10:04,740
It's okay.

2985
03:10:04,960 --> 03:10:05,220
Boop.

2986
03:10:05,800 --> 03:10:08,560
Oh, there's, like, no more, like, uh, oh, never mind.

2987
03:10:09,120 --> 03:10:10,440
Oh, wait, this is easier.

2988
03:10:10,660 --> 03:10:15,360
This is, like, easier than the fucking, uh, than the
straight line thing.

2989
03:10:15,860 --> 03:10:17,180
Why would this one be easier?

2990
03:10:18,400 --> 03:10:20,640
This is, like, literally endgame, isn't it?

2991
03:10:22,320 --> 03:10:22,720
Oh!

2992
03:10:23,360 --> 03:10:24,920
Guys, it's easier, I swear.

2993
03:10:32,220 --> 03:10:36,500
Doki Mado, FPS VTube, and I found a hidden passage in the
wardrobe.

2994
03:10:36,960 --> 03:10:38,500
That leads right to the library car.

2995
03:10:39,600 --> 03:10:40,000
What?

2996
03:10:40,740 --> 03:10:41,760
A secret passage?

2997
03:10:41,900 --> 03:10:43,520
Yes, it's literally right in front of us, Amy.

2998
03:10:44,320 --> 03:10:48,580
So someone could have used the passage, snuck through the
library car, walked past the distracted boys playing arcade,

2999
03:10:49,080 --> 03:10:52,260
and safely arrived at the dining car to eat all those chain
of dogs, and get a food coma?

3000
03:10:53,600 --> 03:10:55,820
Excellent work, Doki made of FPS B-Tube.

3001
03:10:58,060 --> 03:10:59,160
That just my fear.

3002
03:10:59,300 --> 03:11:00,640
Yeah, just a little bit, by the way.

3003
03:11:01,140 --> 03:11:05,820
The Shadow murdered Sonic in the conductor car, but then
thought the crime scene being so close to the station was

3004
03:11:05,820 --> 03:11:06,340
suspicious.

3005
03:11:07,020 --> 03:11:12,380
Shadow picked up Sonic, locked the door to the conductor car
on the way out, and dropped the body off at the dining car?

3006
03:11:13,560 --> 03:11:15,000
Happy birthday, it's my birthday.

3007
03:11:15,920 --> 03:11:17,900
Are you officially accusing Shadow of murder?

3008
03:11:18,800 --> 03:11:22,060
I am, but of course, this is just a theory.

3009
03:11:22,500 --> 03:11:23,960
A game theory.

3010
03:11:24,800 --> 03:11:29,480
I don't have any evidence to back this up other than my hot
scoop.

3011
03:11:31,420 --> 03:11:33,600
Seems Tails and I were more thorough than you.

3012
03:11:33,960 --> 03:11:36,040
The shadow's not going to talk.

3013
03:11:36,420 --> 03:11:37,540
Then I'll hear you once again.

3014
03:11:38,340 --> 03:11:41,900
The shadow traveled through the hidden passage and appeared
in the library car.

3015
03:11:42,360 --> 03:11:45,180
Then how did SBR and Vesper not see him?

3016
03:11:46,480 --> 03:11:51,220
Um, well, I suppose it would be hard to sneak around two
people.

3017
03:11:51,960 --> 03:11:53,700
Joki made an FPS VTuber.

3018
03:11:54,000 --> 03:11:55,660
Do you have any guesses?

3019
03:11:56,080 --> 03:11:56,560
Wait, what?

3020
03:11:56,840 --> 03:11:57,040
Okay.

3021
03:11:59,680 --> 03:12:00,240
Because...

3022
03:12:00,240 --> 03:12:01,820
Oh, Espio was reading!

3023
03:12:02,620 --> 03:12:03,980
Wait, it's both right.

3024
03:12:04,620 --> 03:12:07,260
Like, Espio was reading, and...

3025
03:12:07,260 --> 03:12:09,720
Oh, wait, Vector was with Knuckles.

3026
03:12:10,040 --> 03:12:10,300
Yeah.

3027
03:12:10,540 --> 03:12:11,600
I mean, it's...

3028
03:12:11,600 --> 03:12:13,120
They were...

3029
03:12:14,900 --> 03:12:16,840
Well, Vector was with Knuckles.

3030
03:12:17,520 --> 03:12:18,160
That's true.

3031
03:12:18,420 --> 03:12:21,440
Vector was with Knuckles, and would have seen Shadow enter
the...

3032
03:12:21,460 --> 03:12:22,540
a library car.

3033
03:12:23,320 --> 03:12:23,320
See?

3034
03:12:23,940 --> 03:12:25,360
Things are falling into place.

3035
03:12:26,240 --> 03:12:27,940
But what about SBO?

3036
03:12:28,820 --> 03:12:29,480
I believe SBO.

3037
03:12:29,480 --> 03:12:31,040
Yeah, it's an illusion of choice.

3038
03:12:31,200 --> 03:12:32,800
It was both right.

3039
03:12:35,060 --> 03:12:36,800
SBO reading library checks out.

3040
03:12:36,940 --> 03:12:38,620
That's what he told me too.

3041
03:12:40,360 --> 03:12:41,520
He's lying.

3042
03:12:42,520 --> 03:12:42,680
What?

3043
03:12:43,020 --> 03:12:44,000
What was that, Shadow?

3044
03:12:44,980 --> 03:12:52,120
When I completely obliterated Knuckles and Vector at that
whatever game, I left the saloon car.

3045
03:12:52,800 --> 03:12:52,800
What?

3046
03:12:53,820 --> 03:12:54,320
What?

3047
03:12:55,080 --> 03:13:00,460
I spent so much time looking for Espio, but he was not
there.

3048
03:13:01,080 --> 03:13:02,380
He was not in the...

3049
03:13:03,320 --> 03:13:07,060
He was not in the... It was the poet!

3050
03:13:08,140 --> 03:13:10,160
Like, I believe you.

3051
03:13:10,480 --> 03:13:13,300
You're currently my number one suspect.

3052
03:13:13,640 --> 03:13:14,420
What?

3053
03:13:15,880 --> 03:13:18,080
It wasn't a butler.

3054
03:13:18,520 --> 03:13:22,660
Why were you even searching for SBO, huh?

3055
03:13:23,100 --> 03:13:24,720
Bum, bum, bum!

3056
03:13:27,260 --> 03:13:30,880
You must know I needed to give him a key.

3057
03:13:32,500 --> 03:13:36,680
As if why would Locksmith be giving away his keys?

3058
03:13:38,000 --> 03:13:41,220
Shadow has been giving away a lot of keys, actually.

3059
03:13:41,800 --> 03:13:43,640
Everyone but us seems to have one.

3060
03:13:44,400 --> 03:13:45,280
That's true.

3061
03:13:45,700 --> 03:13:48,020
Everyone's been able to unlock the next door for us.

3062
03:13:48,600 --> 03:13:50,040
I didn't know that.

3063
03:13:50,400 --> 03:13:52,280
Shadow's been passing out keys?

3064
03:13:53,120 --> 03:13:54,120
How could he?

3065
03:13:54,360 --> 03:13:57,440
I can't believe he's doing his job.

3066
03:13:59,460 --> 03:14:03,100
Perhaps Doki made out of FPS VTube and I can further
validate Shadow's claims.

3067
03:14:03,220 --> 03:14:03,980
Oh, it's a key ring.

3068
03:14:04,360 --> 03:14:05,680
It's also like the last thing.

3069
03:14:06,440 --> 03:14:07,220
We can do what?

3070
03:14:07,900 --> 03:14:09,100
Doki made out of FPS VTube.

3071
03:14:09,160 --> 03:14:11,160
What evidence supports Shadow's claim that he was getting?

3072
03:14:11,180 --> 03:14:11,640
Oh, wait, no.

3073
03:14:11,920 --> 03:14:12,200
Yeah.

3074
03:14:12,360 --> 03:14:13,980
He doesn't have a lot of keys left.

3075
03:14:14,500 --> 03:14:15,240
He just has two.

3076
03:14:17,080 --> 03:14:18,200
He is the key, man.

3077
03:14:18,360 --> 03:14:20,260
What else we'll be doing with all these keys?

3078
03:14:21,340 --> 03:14:32,740
good now to get my thoughts in order think oh shit okay all
right game break time to play my video games this is also

3079
03:14:32,740 --> 03:14:40,940
gonna be okay it's gonna be like the blast i think the blast
is actually easier than the the little uh the fire strike oh

3080
03:14:40,940 --> 03:14:51,540
sorry i got distracted no no don't no oh no this is actually
the worst i've ever done no oh okay i made it i've I barely

3081
03:14:51,540 --> 03:14:52,080
made it.

3082
03:14:52,100 --> 03:14:54,300
I barely made it.

3083
03:14:58,600 --> 03:14:59,180
Okay.

3084
03:14:59,880 --> 03:15:00,900
I still got it.

3085
03:15:01,160 --> 03:15:02,240
There's only one reason.

3086
03:15:02,560 --> 03:15:04,380
I have exactly two keys on that key.

3087
03:15:05,080 --> 03:15:07,860
Those were two keys Shadow meant to give Espion Factor.

3088
03:15:09,280 --> 03:15:09,820
No way.

3089
03:15:10,400 --> 03:15:10,800
Whoa.

3090
03:15:11,940 --> 03:15:13,300
One of his own key.

3091
03:15:13,640 --> 03:15:15,320
Can one of those be for him?

3092
03:15:16,980 --> 03:15:19,160
I have my own key on me.

3093
03:15:22,220 --> 03:15:31,760
likely story it's my birthday so let's say shadow's telling
the truth then what huh and shadow didn't murder sonic and

3094
03:15:31,760 --> 03:15:40,760
bring him to the dining car then what possible reason could
you have for locking all the doors hmm she's right her

3095
03:15:40,760 --> 03:15:48,440
theory is strong tales and I certainly haven't presented any
possibilities and shadow really instant in sonic's murder

3096
03:15:48,440 --> 03:15:52,220
it's because he didn't buy you a birthday gift he's a leech.

3097
03:15:54,220 --> 03:15:59,500
I think Doki made a FBSB too and I know exactly why Shadow
was locking all that doors.

3098
03:16:00,400 --> 03:16:02,620
Why does she keep including me too?

3099
03:16:02,900 --> 03:16:05,440
I'm just a butler slash microwave guy.

3100
03:16:07,520 --> 03:16:07,520
Huh?

3101
03:16:08,040 --> 03:16:10,100
Has everyone today given you a birthday present?

3102
03:16:10,460 --> 03:16:10,920
Yeah!

3103
03:16:11,500 --> 03:16:12,460
Yeah, Amy!

3104
03:16:13,020 --> 03:16:14,300
Almost everyone.

3105
03:16:14,740 --> 03:16:14,740
Yeah?

3106
03:16:15,080 --> 03:16:16,800
Everyone's been so sweet.

3107
03:16:17,900 --> 03:16:18,220
Oh.

3108
03:16:19,160 --> 03:16:19,880
Everyone.

3109
03:16:22,980 --> 03:16:25,700
He's just forgetful, Doki.

3110
03:16:26,720 --> 03:16:28,060
Hop off my goat.

3111
03:16:28,300 --> 03:16:31,540
How dare you say that about my Oshi?

3112
03:16:33,200 --> 03:16:35,460
The shadow of Sonic haven't given me anything yet.

3113
03:16:35,860 --> 03:16:36,640
But that's okay.

3114
03:16:36,960 --> 03:16:38,500
Just them being here isn't...

3115
03:16:38,500 --> 03:16:39,900
Oh my god, Amy, you're too nice.

3116
03:16:40,820 --> 03:16:41,340
Understood.

3117
03:16:41,580 --> 03:16:42,580
Thank you, Amy.

3118
03:16:43,460 --> 03:16:44,960
Doki made an FPS V2.

3119
03:16:46,080 --> 03:16:46,960
Uh, yes, Tails.

3120
03:16:47,700 --> 03:16:48,360
I have a theory.

3121
03:16:48,600 --> 03:16:50,440
Find a piece of evidence to support it.

3122
03:16:51,340 --> 03:16:55,520
We know Shadow walked through every train door, locking the
exit.

3123
03:16:55,980 --> 03:16:58,540
And he gave everyone stationed in the car a key.

3124
03:16:59,460 --> 03:17:01,640
Except for you, me, and Amy.

3125
03:17:02,960 --> 03:17:04,240
That's right.

3126
03:17:04,740 --> 03:17:08,960
The conductor gave her Amy her birthday key, not Shadow.

3127
03:17:09,960 --> 03:17:14,200
So why would he lock all the doors and not give us a key?

3128
03:17:16,180 --> 03:17:18,600
He wanted to keep us away.

3129
03:17:19,660 --> 03:17:21,320
Was Shadow locking all the doors to...

3130
03:17:21,340 --> 03:17:22,880
Keep us away.

3131
03:17:23,100 --> 03:17:24,360
Bum, bum, bum.

3132
03:17:26,340 --> 03:17:28,260
Nod us, Doki Mado, FPS VTube.

3133
03:17:28,760 --> 03:17:30,940
I'm making a leap here, but stick with me.

3134
03:17:31,600 --> 03:17:34,620
I think Shadow was trying to keep Amy away.

3135
03:17:35,340 --> 03:17:37,000
Oh my god, finally!

3136
03:17:37,520 --> 03:17:40,840
We knew this for like 20 minutes ago.

3137
03:17:42,820 --> 03:17:44,060
Holy shit.

3138
03:17:45,160 --> 03:17:51,120
Guys, any time now to solve that mystery about Sonic's
death.

3139
03:17:56,180 --> 03:17:56,700
Like...

3140
03:17:57,240 --> 03:17:57,760
Hmm...

3141
03:17:57,760 --> 03:17:58,580
Excuse me?

3142
03:18:00,320 --> 03:18:01,780
Shadow will never do that!

3143
03:18:02,120 --> 03:18:03,040
It's my birthday!

3144
03:18:04,400 --> 03:18:05,380
You know it's my birthday, right?

3145
03:18:05,760 --> 03:18:06,520
Don't you, Shadow?

3146
03:18:09,140 --> 03:18:09,660
Hmm...

3147
03:18:09,660 --> 03:18:13,400
How dare Don't keep me in a BSV tomb!

3148
03:18:13,800 --> 03:18:15,040
Show me evidence!

3149
03:18:16,060 --> 03:18:16,460
Huh?

3150
03:18:17,000 --> 03:18:18,280
Is Shadow trying to keep me awake?

3151
03:18:18,460 --> 03:18:18,880
Prove it!

3152
03:18:19,060 --> 03:18:20,280
You've been so thrilled or whatever.

3153
03:18:21,340 --> 03:18:22,320
Proof do you have?

3154
03:18:23,220 --> 03:18:23,720
Okay.

3155
03:18:24,720 --> 03:18:27,420
Tails and Shadow trying to keep just Amy away?

3156
03:18:27,840 --> 03:18:28,120
Why?

3157
03:18:28,440 --> 03:18:35,040
What if it showed what Shadow didn't want Amy to know that
he fucking bought this her birthday gift last minute on the

3158
03:18:35,040 --> 03:18:35,900
fucking train?

3159
03:18:36,780 --> 03:18:37,880
That feels right.

3160
03:18:38,380 --> 03:18:38,680
All right.

3161
03:18:39,180 --> 03:18:39,780
Gaming time.

3162
03:18:40,840 --> 03:18:42,680
I hope this is the last one.

3163
03:18:48,260 --> 03:18:51,320
Guys, all I'm saying, I have never lost.

3164
03:18:51,340 --> 03:19:00,160
a single one it doesn't matter if like i if i was like one
ring away from losing i still haven't lost though that

3165
03:19:00,160 --> 03:19:10,940
doesn't mean i lost chat that doesn't mean i lost it just
meant i did it there you go this has to be end game look at

3166
03:19:10,940 --> 03:19:12,540
all the blast

3167
03:19:16,370 --> 03:19:23,590
you went breathing through the trash what the is wrong with
you what is that.

3168
03:19:24,210 --> 03:19:25,910
We found this in the trash bin.

3169
03:19:26,170 --> 03:19:27,190
Next to it, I'll print her.

3170
03:19:28,630 --> 03:19:29,050
Hot Honey.

3171
03:19:29,770 --> 03:19:31,770
It's of a band's ticket website.

3172
03:19:32,770 --> 03:19:33,190
Tails.

3173
03:19:34,250 --> 03:19:34,910
Don't.

3174
03:19:35,330 --> 03:19:37,550
This is Hot Honey's website.

3175
03:19:38,150 --> 03:19:39,110
No way!

3176
03:19:41,340 --> 03:19:42,380
Hot Honey.

3177
03:19:42,500 --> 03:19:43,740
Oh no, they use Ticketmaster.

3178
03:19:44,420 --> 03:19:44,820
No.

3179
03:19:45,380 --> 03:19:48,440
Shadow, you're going to get scammed with all the fees.

3180
03:19:49,160 --> 03:19:49,160
Shadow.

3181
03:19:49,660 --> 03:19:50,840
Shadow, no.

3182
03:19:51,660 --> 03:19:54,300
Don't fucking fall for Ticketmaster.

3183
03:19:57,220 --> 03:19:59,620
It's the band I'm currently obsessed with.

3184
03:20:00,100 --> 03:20:02,920
Jeremy B is my current favorite.

3185
03:20:05,880 --> 03:20:08,600
All the members have B after their new name.

3186
03:20:11,320 --> 03:20:11,860
Isn't it cute?

3187
03:20:12,060 --> 03:20:14,420
I haven't gone to any other shows yet to see them though.

3188
03:20:15,180 --> 03:20:16,980
Their tickets are really hard to get.

3189
03:20:17,320 --> 03:20:20,900
They have to be really online at a specific time.

3190
03:20:21,280 --> 03:20:21,900
And they sell out.

3191
03:20:21,980 --> 03:20:23,460
They don't need a sponsorship.

3192
03:20:24,660 --> 03:20:33,420
a monopoly on fucking concert tickets like what do you mean
like they don't they don't need it because they're literally

3193
03:20:33,420 --> 03:20:40,820
the only place you can grab tickets unless you want to buy
scalpers but even then they're still fees okay anyway they

3194
03:20:40,820 --> 03:20:51,920
still admit this so the question becomes why was this paper
found in the train car shadow station in watch yourself fox

3195
03:20:51,920 --> 03:20:57,640
a situation becoming much clearer I don't know how Tails
figure things out so soon.

3196
03:20:57,940 --> 03:20:58,820
But I see where he's heading.

3197
03:20:59,400 --> 03:21:01,120
Bro, he's just playing the video game faster than me.

3198
03:21:02,380 --> 03:21:05,120
The printout of the hot honey band tickets website exists
because...

3199
03:21:06,020 --> 03:21:06,900
I don't know.

3200
03:21:07,180 --> 03:21:08,360
Fucking he was trying to buy tickets.

3201
03:21:08,500 --> 03:21:10,980
Like, where else would this go to?

3202
03:21:14,280 --> 03:21:15,840
Shadow's also a big hot...

3203
03:21:15,840 --> 03:21:17,260
Okay, yeah, that's another choice.

3204
03:21:19,940 --> 03:21:20,340
What?

3205
03:21:20,740 --> 03:21:21,980
Shadow, is this true?

3206
03:21:22,780 --> 03:21:24,300
Are you trying to get more cost tickets?

3207
03:21:24,660 --> 03:21:26,020
For my birthday!

3208
03:21:27,840 --> 03:21:28,360
Hmm.

3209
03:21:28,860 --> 03:21:31,280
I've done a poor job hiding the surprise, it seems.

3210
03:21:31,620 --> 03:21:32,300
Well, did you get it?

3211
03:21:32,600 --> 03:21:35,080
Yes, I'm trying to get you concert tickets for your
birthday.

3212
03:21:36,160 --> 03:21:36,480
Hmm.

3213
03:21:37,780 --> 03:21:38,300
Shadow!

3214
03:21:38,840 --> 03:21:40,180
She didn't even do it.

3215
03:21:40,980 --> 03:21:41,500
Like...

3216
03:21:42,220 --> 03:21:42,740
Like...

3217
03:21:42,740 --> 03:21:44,880
He didn't even do it, though.

3218
03:21:44,980 --> 03:21:45,780
He couldn't.

3219
03:21:46,320 --> 03:21:49,440
I used that printer earlier, and I found it difficult to
manage.

3220
03:21:49,880 --> 03:21:53,120
When logging on to the website, did you print the homepage
by accident?

3221
03:21:54,660 --> 03:22:01,480
you for the super chat thank you thank you yes that's
exactly what happened i'm not fantastic with computers

3222
03:22:01,480 --> 03:22:13,820
admittedly wait the ultimate life form is not a gamer what
he doesn't represent the people what but i thought i thought

3223
03:22:13,820 --> 03:22:17,940
you were supposed to be the gamer edge lord no

3224
03:22:21,920 --> 03:22:25,560
i can't believe this after i accused you a murder.

3225
03:22:27,520 --> 03:22:28,640
Spill everything, Shadow.

3226
03:22:28,940 --> 03:22:30,240
The cat's out of the bag.

3227
03:22:30,640 --> 03:22:32,300
I want to know everything.

3228
03:22:32,920 --> 03:22:34,360
I didn't get the tickets in me.

3229
03:22:34,740 --> 03:22:35,820
Like, fine.

3230
03:22:36,020 --> 03:22:37,480
The surprise is ruined anyway.

3231
03:22:39,140 --> 03:22:40,280
Probably our fault there.

3232
03:22:40,980 --> 03:22:43,840
Sorry, that's all the detective's job, I suppose.

3233
03:22:44,660 --> 03:22:48,360
When I arrived on the train, I realized everyone else had a
gift except for me.

3234
03:22:49,280 --> 03:22:50,640
Weird for my social status.

3235
03:22:51,140 --> 03:22:54,640
I immediately began brainstorming ideas and saw the
computer.

3236
03:22:55,520 --> 03:22:59,180
I remember Amy had never seen Hot Honey Live and looked it
up.

3237
03:22:59,620 --> 03:23:01,440
That's why I accidentally printed the home page.

3238
03:23:01,900 --> 03:23:05,680
The concert tickets weren't actually on sale, I realized,
but would be available soon.

3239
03:23:06,840 --> 03:23:08,700
Is that the appointment you keep speaking of?

3240
03:23:09,060 --> 03:23:11,460
The time you're able to actually buy the concert tickets?

3241
03:23:12,440 --> 03:23:12,880
Precisely.

3242
03:23:13,300 --> 03:23:13,880
I haven't purchased.

3243
03:23:13,960 --> 03:23:14,420
Yeah, I know.

3244
03:23:14,560 --> 03:23:15,380
I told you!

3245
03:23:16,080 --> 03:23:16,520
Bro!

3246
03:23:16,960 --> 03:23:23,240
Okay, I literally, if they let me talk, I would have
fucking, this murder party will be done in an hour.

3247
03:23:23,760 --> 03:23:24,200
Yeah.

3248
03:23:24,660 --> 03:23:27,400
And you had to keep Amy away while I waited behind tickets.

3249
03:23:27,760 --> 03:23:29,020
So I began locking all the doors.

3250
03:23:29,880 --> 03:23:33,460
But for the safety of everyone, I handed out keys so they
could get in and out.

3251
03:23:33,820 --> 03:23:35,360
Tell them not to let anyone through.

3252
03:23:36,920 --> 03:23:38,940
He's worried of his social status.

3253
03:23:40,080 --> 03:23:44,440
Like, look, it took him a lot of years to craft this social
status.

3254
03:23:46,420 --> 03:23:47,040
It didn't work.

3255
03:23:47,400 --> 03:23:49,140
Amy still managed to make here somehow.

3256
03:23:50,140 --> 03:23:52,120
It's because the conductor gave me this.

3257
03:23:53,120 --> 03:23:53,600
Yeah.

3258
03:23:53,840 --> 03:23:54,320
Yeah.

3259
03:23:54,660 --> 03:23:57,120
This key opens up any door on the train.

3260
03:23:58,000 --> 03:24:00,580
I've gone through every locked door with ease.

3261
03:24:02,800 --> 03:24:04,360
The plan's fatal flaw.

3262
03:24:05,580 --> 03:24:06,680
Journalist mode.

3263
03:24:08,140 --> 03:24:08,780
I should have guessed.

3264
03:24:09,340 --> 03:24:10,740
It's a well-known privilege.

3265
03:24:11,960 --> 03:24:13,080
Shadow, I...

3266
03:24:13,080 --> 03:24:14,520
Your gesture is so sweet.

3267
03:24:15,000 --> 03:24:17,360
And after I accused you, too...

3268
03:24:17,360 --> 03:24:18,380
How about this?

3269
03:24:18,660 --> 03:24:19,860
Let's buy the tickets later.

3270
03:24:20,160 --> 03:24:23,000
And to make it up to you, you can come with...

3271
03:24:23,000 --> 03:24:24,280
Wait, bro, it's...

3272
03:24:24,280 --> 03:24:24,640
What?

3273
03:24:25,520 --> 03:24:28,460
Why would she make it up for her?

3274
03:24:28,820 --> 03:24:29,940
Like, for her shadow.

3275
03:24:30,740 --> 03:24:31,560
It's her birthday.

3276
03:24:31,700 --> 03:24:34,980
She's the one that didn't even get the birthday present.

3277
03:24:35,980 --> 03:24:36,220
What?

3278
03:24:40,340 --> 03:24:42,800
Like, I don't understand.

3279
03:24:43,300 --> 03:24:43,960
Like, why?

3280
03:24:44,340 --> 03:24:46,340
He's the one that fucked up.

3281
03:24:47,060 --> 03:24:49,840
I don't know if...

3282
03:24:49,840 --> 03:24:50,580
Too late.

3283
03:24:50,680 --> 03:24:51,160
It's happening.

3284
03:24:51,640 --> 03:24:52,600
I can't wait.

3285
03:24:53,080 --> 03:24:54,020
A show of a lifetime.

3286
03:24:55,320 --> 03:24:55,760
Fine.

3287
03:24:56,460 --> 03:24:59,040
Does that mean she's paying for her own fucking tickets?

3288
03:24:59,640 --> 03:25:00,540
Happy birthday, Amy.

3289
03:25:00,780 --> 03:25:02,000
Thanks for buying my tickets.

3290
03:25:04,460 --> 03:25:07,580
I expect lots of pictures from the concert, you two.

3291
03:25:09,780 --> 03:25:12,820
Seems that Mr. Shadow's locked door has finally reached the
end.

3292
03:25:15,740 --> 03:25:18,180
I blame my source for all of this.

3293
03:25:18,580 --> 03:25:19,740
That was a hot tip at all.

3294
03:25:20,020 --> 03:25:22,300
They need me to believe Shadow was behind everything.

3295
03:25:23,240 --> 03:25:26,480
My credibility as a journalist report point it down the
drain.

3296
03:25:27,440 --> 03:25:28,340
I'm curious.

3297
03:25:29,000 --> 03:25:30,800
What is the source of your big scoop?

3298
03:25:31,860 --> 03:25:33,000
I'd like to know as well.

3299
03:25:34,200 --> 03:25:34,320
Sorry.

3300
03:25:34,860 --> 03:25:35,880
Strictly confidential.

3301
03:25:36,360 --> 03:25:37,060
Trust me, bro.

3302
03:25:38,200 --> 03:25:43,260
My credibility may be shot, but my principal must stay
intact.

3303
03:25:45,040 --> 03:25:47,440
I have a strong feeling to know who exactly is your source.

3304
03:25:47,500 --> 03:25:48,100
Is it Sonic?

3305
03:25:48,820 --> 03:25:49,380
Huh?

3306
03:25:49,820 --> 03:25:52,480
But we need to investigate one last area.

3307
03:25:53,020 --> 03:25:54,640
The conductor's car.

3308
03:25:54,660 --> 03:25:55,540
Oh, is it a conductor?

3309
03:25:56,540 --> 03:25:57,380
I'll come with you.

3310
03:25:57,740 --> 03:26:00,940
I'd love to know who's been dragging my name throughout the
mud.

3311
03:26:01,820 --> 03:26:03,220
I'll join you as well.

3312
03:26:03,980 --> 03:26:05,600
Now you see us through the end.

3313
03:26:06,460 --> 03:26:08,000
We're more than happy to have you both.

3314
03:26:08,880 --> 03:26:10,440
Doki made our FPS VTube.

3315
03:26:10,740 --> 03:26:14,260
I just say it, but I believe our investigation finally is
coming to the close.

3316
03:26:14,360 --> 03:26:15,920
Oh my God, we're going to figure it out.

3317
03:26:16,500 --> 03:26:17,120
It's being unclear.

3318
03:26:17,380 --> 03:26:18,240
Has it really?

3319
03:26:18,580 --> 03:26:20,300
I honestly think Sonic's in a coma.

3320
03:26:21,000 --> 03:26:24,080
Not like actual coma, but in the food coma from all the
chili dogs.

3321
03:26:24,660 --> 03:26:25,580
and this is.

3322
03:26:25,840 --> 03:26:27,820
We'll pin down Sonic's murder for good!

3323
03:26:28,680 --> 03:26:29,440
Right on then.

3324
03:26:29,840 --> 03:26:31,320
Let's do it!

3325
03:26:32,140 --> 03:26:32,460
Alright.

3326
03:26:32,800 --> 03:26:33,240
Nice.

3327
03:26:34,580 --> 03:26:35,240
Anything else?

3328
03:26:35,500 --> 03:26:35,680
Okay.

3329
03:26:37,340 --> 03:26:38,440
Let's finish this.

3330
03:26:39,060 --> 03:26:40,660
It's now or never!

3331
03:26:46,240 --> 03:26:48,020
The conductor's car.

3332
03:26:50,720 --> 03:26:52,860
It's really strong my evidence before I continue.

3333
03:26:53,340 --> 03:26:56,820
In my short time working on this train, I haven't visited a
conductor's car yet.

3334
03:26:58,380 --> 03:27:04,380
empty yeah where's the conductor wait where's yeah where's
the conductor that's odd i haven't seen him throughout the

3335
03:27:04,380 --> 03:27:12,920
train at all the best we saw him was when he left the dining
car something clearly happened here nothing we can't figure

3336
03:27:12,920 --> 03:27:22,480
out come on time to investigate whoa obviously the spilled
cup did this fall over when the train sped up did he have a

3337
03:27:22,480 --> 03:27:34,440
heart attack not sure wait what's it say on the mug a cup of
joe in your hand wife by your side paradise all right all

oh the arms when the arms broken wait what's this what's

3339
03:27:44,420 --> 03:27:52,700
this with someone playing darts that's not throwing dart
that's a blow wait it wasn't

3340
03:27:56,960 --> 03:28:05,060
someone brought this weapon onto the train that shouldn't be
possible how did he bring the how did he bring it

3341
03:28:08,270 --> 03:28:17,070
tails is right tails the train detects any weapons on a
passenger train before letting them abroad let's make note

3342
03:28:17,070 --> 03:28:22,990
of this load dart is adding your inventory okay there's no
way there's anything else in the trash I don't need yeah see

3343
03:28:22,990 --> 03:28:28,330
you're satisfied with finding clue here before huh I know
they say always check the trash bin, but I'm good.

3344
03:28:28,650 --> 03:28:29,970
I'll go on a high note.

3345
03:28:30,110 --> 03:28:32,430
See, I told you there's nothing in that trash bin.

3346
03:28:34,510 --> 03:28:37,070
This robot on has been completely torn off.

3347
03:28:39,770 --> 03:28:40,430
How creepy.

3348
03:28:41,470 --> 03:28:42,410
My arm is powerful.

3349
03:28:43,230 --> 03:28:44,910
It'd be tough to break out its grip.

3350
03:28:46,070 --> 03:28:49,090
A lot of people here have strength to tear this off, but the
question is why?

3351
03:28:50,030 --> 03:28:53,130
A confrontation definitely occurred in this room.

3352
03:28:53,590 --> 03:28:54,650
We should log this.

3353
03:28:55,230 --> 03:28:56,110
Aye, aye, sir.

3354
03:28:57,290 --> 03:28:58,310
Broken robot arm.

3355
03:28:58,970 --> 03:29:00,030
Yeah, I think we have enough clues.

3356
03:29:01,930 --> 03:29:02,150
Okay.

3357
03:29:02,750 --> 03:29:03,050
Amy!

3358
03:29:03,390 --> 03:29:04,930
I have the clues ready!

3359
03:29:05,730 --> 03:29:06,710
I'm ready to...

3360
03:29:06,710 --> 03:29:07,090
Oh, hey.

3361
03:29:08,210 --> 03:29:08,530
Oh.

3362
03:29:08,850 --> 03:29:09,510
I'm gonna skip.

3363
03:29:09,590 --> 03:29:11,290
Oh, next being for nasal medication.

3364
03:29:11,410 --> 03:29:11,730
Was that...

3365
03:29:11,730 --> 03:29:11,990
What?

3366
03:29:12,350 --> 03:29:14,150
Oh, the next ad I should have skipped that.

3367
03:29:14,250 --> 03:29:15,290
Okay, I was like, huh?

3368
03:29:15,570 --> 03:29:16,810
Perhaps too much detail.

3369
03:29:17,810 --> 03:29:19,050
Oh my god, there's him.

3370
03:29:19,110 --> 03:29:19,830
Look at him!

3371
03:29:19,890 --> 03:29:21,210
He looks so young.

3372
03:29:22,130 --> 03:29:23,550
Look at this doggo.

3373
03:29:23,890 --> 03:29:24,450
Alright, Amy.

3374
03:29:24,550 --> 03:29:25,990
I'm ready to solve the case.

3375
03:29:27,290 --> 03:29:29,670
You know this game is supposed to be two hours max?

3376
03:29:30,470 --> 03:29:30,870
Yeah.

3377
03:29:36,930 --> 03:29:40,990
Think you have enough eminence for me to call everyone here?

3378
03:29:44,530 --> 03:29:45,690
What do you think?

3379
03:29:46,530 --> 03:29:48,110
Jokey made a FPS V2.

3380
03:29:48,350 --> 03:29:49,690
Ready to solve this case?

3381
03:29:50,710 --> 03:29:51,150
Yes.

3382
03:29:51,990 --> 03:29:52,970
Hello, everyone.

3383
03:29:53,410 --> 03:29:55,550
This is our birthday, girl speaking.

3384
03:29:59,560 --> 03:30:02,880
Please report to the conductor car at once.

3385
03:30:08,060 --> 03:30:09,380
This is it.

3386
03:30:10,320 --> 03:30:11,060
Hello, everybody.

3387
03:30:11,600 --> 03:30:13,540
Sonic's not here because he's fucking dead.

3388
03:30:16,140 --> 03:30:17,120
Wonderful to have you all here.

3389
03:30:17,580 --> 03:30:19,940
Tails and I are ready to announce our primes.

3390
03:30:20,060 --> 03:30:20,540
I am.

3391
03:30:20,720 --> 03:30:21,040
Okay.

3392
03:30:21,480 --> 03:30:22,600
Oh, I don't need to do it.

3393
03:30:22,820 --> 03:30:23,240
Oh, okay.

3394
03:30:23,360 --> 03:30:23,660
I do.

3395
03:30:24,020 --> 03:30:26,540
With assistance from Doki Mado FPS B2.

3396
03:30:27,560 --> 03:30:28,640
Why is it Sonic?

3397
03:30:28,660 --> 03:30:29,540
Sonic showed up.

3398
03:30:30,380 --> 03:30:30,560
Huh?

3399
03:30:33,740 --> 03:30:34,180
Sonic?

3400
03:30:35,180 --> 03:30:35,620
Vector!

3401
03:30:37,200 --> 03:30:38,900
Real quick, can you come with me to get Sonic?

3402
03:30:39,960 --> 03:30:42,780
He must still be pretending to be dead, lazy bum.

3403
03:30:43,640 --> 03:30:45,160
Ready, let's go get him!

3404
03:30:45,960 --> 03:30:47,100
Alright, let's get it wrapped Sonic.

3405
03:30:47,960 --> 03:30:51,980
Let me tell you, darlings, this has been a delight.

3406
03:30:53,600 --> 03:30:54,300
A delight.

3407
03:30:55,500 --> 03:30:57,960
The air in here is so intense.

3408
03:30:58,660 --> 03:30:59,500
I love it.

3409
03:30:59,640 --> 03:31:00,280
I don't know.

3410
03:31:00,680 --> 03:31:02,880
My voice for Rouge keep fucking changing.

3411
03:31:04,160 --> 03:31:06,480
Nothing like the thrill of mystery.

3412
03:31:08,500 --> 03:31:11,020
The train has so many amenities.

3413
03:31:11,960 --> 03:31:13,880
I feel so catered to.

3414
03:31:15,520 --> 03:31:17,900
Admittedly, I've been having a lot of fun myself.

3415
03:31:18,360 --> 03:31:20,260
The amusement of a chase.

3416
03:31:21,720 --> 03:31:25,360
I see why you're a detective outside of this mystery SPL.

3417
03:31:26,060 --> 03:31:26,920
Wait, he's a detective?

3418
03:31:27,080 --> 03:31:28,040
I thought he was a ninja.

3419
03:31:28,660 --> 03:31:31,540
Yeah, and I love a good thrill, it seems.

3420
03:31:31,880 --> 03:31:32,780
I thought he was a ninja.

3421
03:31:33,640 --> 03:31:36,380
But on this train, I am but a humble poet.

3422
03:31:36,440 --> 03:31:37,460
Is he a ninja detective?

3423
03:31:39,820 --> 03:31:42,620
I'd be willing to do an event like this again.

3424
03:31:43,200 --> 03:31:45,740
It says here, the train does escape rooms as well.

3425
03:31:46,520 --> 03:31:47,920
He's a detective ninja?

3426
03:31:48,500 --> 03:31:50,100
Bro, he can do anything.

3427
03:31:50,480 --> 03:31:51,320
Fucking nerd.

3428
03:31:52,340 --> 03:31:53,160
I love escape.

3429
03:31:53,280 --> 03:31:54,400
I fucking hate escape.

3430
03:31:55,780 --> 03:31:57,180
Count me in.

3431
03:31:58,660 --> 03:32:00,480
glad everyone's having a good time.

3432
03:32:01,760 --> 03:32:04,620
Maybe we can get rid of a train just to relax.

3433
03:32:04,700 --> 03:32:04,980
Oh, wait.

3434
03:32:05,020 --> 03:32:05,600
Maybe we could, sorry.

3435
03:32:05,800 --> 03:32:06,860
I was like, get rid of the train.

3436
03:32:07,140 --> 03:32:10,200
Maybe we can ride the train just to relax sometime.

3437
03:32:11,100 --> 03:32:12,840
Yeah, that'd be fun, too.

3438
03:32:13,860 --> 03:32:14,300
Ah!

3439
03:32:17,700 --> 03:32:18,140
Whoa!

3440
03:32:19,000 --> 03:32:19,440
Huh?

3441
03:32:20,140 --> 03:32:21,360
What in the world?

3442
03:32:21,600 --> 03:32:22,260
Oh, okay, wait.

3443
03:32:22,500 --> 03:32:23,580
What in the world?

3444
03:32:24,460 --> 03:32:25,780
That's Amy's voice.

3445
03:32:26,660 --> 03:32:27,100
Quick.

3446
03:32:27,560 --> 03:32:27,860
Oh, wait.

3447
03:32:27,980 --> 03:32:28,280
Quick.

3448
03:32:28,420 --> 03:32:29,120
Where's Amy.

3449
03:32:30,420 --> 03:32:34,120
Oh my god.

3450
03:32:34,860 --> 03:32:35,920
He's dead.

3451
03:32:37,240 --> 03:32:39,360
He's not responding to us.

3452
03:32:40,400 --> 03:32:40,420
Sonic!

3453
03:32:41,360 --> 03:32:41,360
Sonic!

3454
03:32:42,780 --> 03:32:43,900
Is he hurt?

3455
03:32:44,980 --> 03:32:46,960
Guys, trust me, I checked his pulse.

3456
03:32:47,080 --> 03:32:47,920
He's definitely dead.

3457
03:32:50,520 --> 03:32:50,640
Um.

3458
03:32:51,600 --> 03:32:52,780
Is he hurt?

3459
03:32:54,420 --> 03:32:56,540
Why isn't he moving?

3460
03:32:57,660 --> 03:33:00,000
Sonic, Sonic, can you hear us?

3461
03:33:01,320 --> 03:33:10,680
he's banged up if there's a pulse it's weak oh my god he
actually has a pulse no fucking way set him down make sure

3462
03:33:10,680 --> 03:33:23,680
his head is propped up I'll help you hmm I knew one of you
would take this too far which one of you did this is Sonic

3463
03:33:23,680 --> 03:33:30,480
on my birthday no less does this have been one of us sorry
I'm like Ye-ha.

3464
03:33:31,600 --> 03:33:33,980
Y'all, could this have been one of us?

3465
03:33:37,120 --> 03:33:39,440
There's no one else here, Knuckles.

3466
03:33:40,820 --> 03:33:41,760
So I'll ask again.

3467
03:33:42,340 --> 03:33:43,900
Which one of you did this?

3468
03:33:44,380 --> 03:33:45,120
Is this a conductor?

3469
03:33:46,600 --> 03:33:47,120
Eggman.

3470
03:33:48,180 --> 03:33:49,220
Surprise, Eggman.

3471
03:33:50,380 --> 03:33:51,300
I can't believe it.

3472
03:33:51,320 --> 03:33:52,560
It was not a food coma.

3473
03:33:54,880 --> 03:33:56,240
This is inexcusable.

3474
03:33:56,440 --> 03:33:57,080
Sonic's hurt.

3475
03:33:57,740 --> 03:34:00,000
I'm going to expose the monster who did this.

3476
03:34:01,900 --> 03:34:12,060
Tails is not having it I thought Sonic could handle anything
But somehow he met his match Who murdered Who murdered

3477
03:34:12,060 --> 03:34:12,540
Sonic?

3478
03:34:13,700 --> 03:34:23,820
I'm gonna help you get the bottom of this I'm gonna help you
get the bottom of this Tails Absolutely Me too y'all Same

3479
03:34:24,540 --> 03:34:32,180
We're gonna figure out exactly what happened in this room
And punish the one responsible San Diego, thank you for the

3480
03:34:32,180 --> 03:34:33,060
Akasupa!

3481
03:34:33,420 --> 03:34:34,180
Thank you, thank you.

3482
03:34:34,260 --> 03:34:35,060
Don't kill her.

3483
03:34:36,080 --> 03:34:36,560
Don't kill her.

3484
03:34:36,680 --> 03:34:37,320
I'm not the killer.

3485
03:34:39,180 --> 03:34:39,260
Sonic!

3486
03:34:41,020 --> 03:34:41,960
I'm writing my wrong.

3487
03:34:42,120 --> 03:34:43,260
I must take down the murderer.

3488
03:34:45,660 --> 03:34:48,000
Tails, no key, made out of FPS V-tube.

3489
03:34:48,460 --> 03:34:49,700
I have a big question to ask.

3490
03:34:50,360 --> 03:34:51,420
Who in this room did this?

3491
03:34:51,800 --> 03:34:54,060
Who killed Sonic the Hedgehog?

3492
03:34:58,270 --> 03:34:59,370
Wait, what?

3493
03:35:00,270 --> 03:35:00,650
What?

3494
03:35:04,280 --> 03:35:04,760
Amy!

3495
03:35:06,480 --> 03:35:07,100
That can't be right.

3496
03:35:07,400 --> 03:35:09,160
Night of Tails and I can be the murderer.

3497
03:35:09,920 --> 03:35:10,180
That's right.

3498
03:35:10,400 --> 03:35:11,940
Wait, it's actually not Amy?

3499
03:35:18,320 --> 03:35:20,780
It's actually not Amy?

3500
03:35:22,100 --> 03:35:23,300
Oh my god.

3501
03:35:25,980 --> 03:35:27,200
Um, maybe it's...

3502
03:35:27,200 --> 03:35:28,420
It's the ninja detective.

3503
03:35:28,640 --> 03:35:31,040
Wait, it's the ninja detective because he was gone!

3504
03:35:31,860 --> 03:35:45,420
Espio, you were the one who murdered sonic weren't you i
didn't know such thing my young friend but if it's a battle

3505
03:35:45,420 --> 03:35:56,260
what's you wish i would love to discuss things let's discuss
what you're including espio we already talked about this

3506
03:35:56,260 --> 03:36:05,420
that man was reading you have nothing rotate right restating
espio's alibi will be would be helpful for everyone, I

3507
03:36:05,420 --> 03:36:05,620
think.

3508
03:36:06,540 --> 03:36:08,020
Espio was locked in the library car reading.

3509
03:36:08,360 --> 03:36:10,540
He only had access to the saloon car during the murder.

3510
03:36:11,480 --> 03:36:14,160
However, new evidence has come to light that needs to be
addressed.

3511
03:36:14,620 --> 03:36:17,020
Shadow said you weren't even there.

3512
03:36:18,960 --> 03:36:21,080
Tokimido, FPS, could you fill everyone in?

3513
03:36:21,360 --> 03:36:23,680
What did we find that brings in a question, Espio's alibi?

3514
03:36:24,340 --> 03:36:25,680
We discovered...

3515
03:36:26,380 --> 03:36:27,880
Vector's been active, protective.

3516
03:36:28,280 --> 03:36:31,000
We discovered a hidden passage!

3517
03:36:32,640 --> 03:36:35,000
Espio could laugh the library at any time.

3518
03:36:35,060 --> 03:36:35,220
B.S.

3519
03:36:35,320 --> 03:36:37,620
Tails and I find a hidden passage.

3520
03:36:37,900 --> 03:36:39,060
Bum, bum, bum.

3521
03:36:39,480 --> 03:36:41,640
Speed run to the lounge car.

3522
03:36:41,880 --> 03:36:42,420
Bum, bum.

3523
03:36:43,500 --> 03:36:46,640
In the lounge, the hidden passage exits behind the wardrobe.

3524
03:36:47,080 --> 03:36:49,000
I feel lucky we even found it.

3525
03:36:49,680 --> 03:36:54,420
Not only would Espio avoid any locked doors, oh, Vector is
his boyfriend.

3526
03:36:56,020 --> 03:36:59,020
But that would put him in the car, but just before this one.

3527
03:36:59,840 --> 03:37:02,900
You have no evidence I use any secret passage.

3528
03:37:03,580 --> 03:37:03,980
I answered.

3529
03:37:04,240 --> 03:37:05,960
Oh, the blue dirt, because he's a ninja!

3530
03:37:07,280 --> 03:37:08,720
I was reading the entire time.

3531
03:37:08,780 --> 03:37:09,160
Remember it.

3532
03:37:09,240 --> 03:37:09,500
It's true.

3533
03:37:09,580 --> 03:37:10,440
You didn't miss a question.

3534
03:37:11,020 --> 03:37:14,360
I think Doki made an FPS VTuber, and I can explain that too.

3535
03:37:14,760 --> 03:37:15,860
Doki made an FPS VTuber?

3536
03:37:16,720 --> 03:37:19,480
How did Espinel know everything in the train manual he was
reading?

3537
03:37:21,380 --> 03:37:22,420
Bro, I don't know.

3538
03:37:27,090 --> 03:37:28,370
A ninja like him.

3539
03:37:28,510 --> 03:37:29,490
Speed reads.

3540
03:37:30,130 --> 03:37:33,710
I don't know anything about ninjas, but I assume that's
true.

3541
03:37:34,950 --> 03:37:38,450
He's... Wait, he's fluent in 17 different languages?

3542
03:37:39,070 --> 03:37:40,810
And, bro, what the fuck?

3543
03:37:41,090 --> 03:37:42,910
How much perfect can you be?

3544
03:37:43,290 --> 03:37:45,350
Not perfect enough, because you got caught, bitch.

3545
03:37:45,750 --> 03:37:46,370
By a tomato.

3546
03:37:47,190 --> 03:37:48,590
What are you getting at?

3547
03:37:49,450 --> 03:37:53,350
You picked a random book from the shelf, and...

3548
03:37:53,350 --> 03:37:55,610
What the fuck is wrong with you, SBL?

3549
03:37:56,290 --> 03:37:57,970
That's way too much work.

3550
03:37:58,130 --> 03:37:59,330
Just normal ninja stuff.

3551
03:37:59,770 --> 03:38:01,670
Just normal ninja stuff.

3552
03:38:03,030 --> 03:38:04,930
Just to guarantee yourself, a clean...

3553
03:38:04,950 --> 03:38:18,410
alibi what that's absurd memorizing a whole book i know this
is a talented bunch but that seems like a lot i don't know

3554
03:38:18,410 --> 03:38:23,110
it is seen as plausible espio is particularly skilled

3555
03:38:26,610 --> 03:38:36,790
howdy y'all i've known espio for a long time he once spread
read a run spread read a book i was Just to spoil the ending

3556
03:38:36,790 --> 03:38:37,610
for me.

3557
03:38:37,690 --> 03:38:38,790
Oh my gosh.

3558
03:38:38,970 --> 03:38:39,990
That's what's up, man.

3559
03:38:42,730 --> 03:38:43,550
If I'm right.

3560
03:38:43,950 --> 03:38:45,270
And Espio quickly memorized.

3561
03:38:45,750 --> 03:38:49,930
Bro, he just hates him because he doesn't like that there's
somebody smarter than him.

3562
03:38:50,770 --> 03:38:56,850
But before entering the hidden passage, Espio is a kid that
your mom compares you to Bob.

3563
03:38:57,050 --> 03:38:58,090
Thank you for the super chat.

3564
03:38:58,330 --> 03:38:58,490
Thank you.

3565
03:38:58,590 --> 03:38:59,170
Thank you.

3566
03:39:00,450 --> 03:39:04,830
Then Espio could have met Sonic in the Conductor Scar where
he was murdered.

3567
03:39:04,950 --> 03:39:07,370
Wait, but why was he in a dining car then?

3568
03:39:07,670 --> 03:39:11,430
Since we're only talking what is, let me throw something at
you.

3569
03:39:11,950 --> 03:39:13,490
How is I to know about a hidden passage?

3570
03:39:13,930 --> 03:39:14,790
It's hidden.

3571
03:39:15,850 --> 03:39:16,570
That's right.

3572
03:39:17,070 --> 03:39:19,290
Bro, stop defending him, bro.

3573
03:39:21,230 --> 03:39:21,790
The...

3574
03:39:23,510 --> 03:39:26,450
The chameleon bussy can't be that guy.

3575
03:39:27,970 --> 03:39:31,470
How many of us even have you even known it was there?

3576
03:39:32,130 --> 03:39:33,850
You said it yourself, kid.

3577
03:39:34,170 --> 03:39:34,930
You were lucky.

3578
03:39:34,950 --> 03:39:37,800
didn't even find the passes.

3579
03:39:39,910 --> 03:39:46,810
Doki made a PSB tube and I might not have the answer to...
They had the evidence to answer your question.

3580
03:39:47,830 --> 03:39:49,370
But we know someone who does.

3581
03:39:49,610 --> 03:39:51,790
Doki made a PSB tube.

3582
03:39:53,610 --> 03:39:57,070
Who here has evidence to prove Espio knew about the hidden
passage?

3583
03:40:00,950 --> 03:40:01,430
What?

3584
03:40:02,170 --> 03:40:02,790
What?

3585
03:40:06,950 --> 03:40:16,970
Rouge the bat Rouge we need to see those blueprints
blueprints I didn't even get backseeded for this you so

3586
03:40:16,970 --> 03:40:30,230
blueprints whatever I already used it to sculpt for more
treasures came up cold you can have it blueprints are added

3587
03:40:30,230 --> 03:40:38,330
to my inventory there we go this right here is a blueprint
to the entire train could have easily used this to find the

3588
03:40:38,330 --> 03:40:40,330
hidden passage, because he got it first.

3589
03:40:41,830 --> 03:40:44,010
What makes you think I ever saw those blueprints?

3590
03:40:44,670 --> 03:40:46,950
Rouge had him, because you were in the library first!

3591
03:40:47,470 --> 03:40:49,950
Doki made a FBS B-Tube, do you have an answer for him?

3592
03:40:50,190 --> 03:40:51,830
How could SBFC know his blueprints?

3593
03:40:52,350 --> 03:40:55,030
He found them before Rouge did.

3594
03:40:55,650 --> 03:40:56,190
Wait, what?

3595
03:40:57,130 --> 03:40:59,670
Yeah, he found them before Rouge did.

3596
03:41:00,310 --> 03:41:02,610
Rouge, where did you find the blueprints?

3597
03:41:03,490 --> 03:41:05,050
Oh, um, the library car.

3598
03:41:05,530 --> 03:41:07,150
There's stuff with the shares.

3599
03:41:07,970 --> 03:41:12,150
I checked the saloon car first, then found the blueprints
after leaving.

3600
03:41:13,170 --> 03:41:17,170
So that means SBO had time to find the blueprints and
discover the hidden pass away!

3601
03:41:18,630 --> 03:41:23,730
In my theory, SBO looked at the blueprints and then used the
hidden passage to get to Sonic.

3602
03:41:24,650 --> 03:41:30,110
Within Amy's guidelines, the murderer can kill a single
participant however they choose.

3603
03:41:30,730 --> 03:41:35,030
The logistics are still vague, but Doki made up FPS V2 and I
have evidence on how Sonic was murdered.

3604
03:41:35,710 --> 03:41:42,170
I'm unsure how SPL cause Sonic, but Jokey made on FPS V2,
and I have evidence on how it was done.

3605
03:41:43,050 --> 03:41:43,250
Huh.

3606
03:41:44,190 --> 03:41:45,470
Oh, this is rich.

3607
03:41:45,890 --> 03:41:46,550
Pray tell.

3608
03:41:48,090 --> 03:41:51,510
If I murder Sonic, how did I do it?

3609
03:41:52,470 --> 03:41:55,510
Now, blow dart, you fucking ninja!

3610
03:41:57,590 --> 03:41:59,810
Now to farm my argument.

3611
03:42:00,630 --> 03:42:01,330
Come on, focus.

3612
03:42:01,470 --> 03:42:01,910
Oh, God.

3613
03:42:01,970 --> 03:42:02,790
Wait, this wasn't over.

3614
03:42:06,770 --> 03:42:23,210
guess it wasn't over I thought it was over but there's two
more rounds of this yeah there was actually more it's okay

3615
03:42:23,210 --> 03:42:28,250
we got this oh what first

3616
03:42:31,630 --> 03:42:44,330
this is bullshit oh my god my actual first dead that was
actually bullshit I can't believe it I can't believe I can't

3617
03:42:44,330 --> 03:42:58,990
believe that happened like why would I fucking be at the
springs oh my god I I can't believe it my perfect my perfect

3618
03:42:58,990 --> 03:43:11,250
world record my streak the blow dart was found here in the
conductor room I believe SPL used this to knock Sonic

3619
03:43:11,250 --> 03:43:12,130
unconscious.

3620
03:43:14,170 --> 03:43:14,470
Nice.

3621
03:43:15,670 --> 03:43:18,090
So you mean Sonic might just be knocked out?

3622
03:43:19,470 --> 03:43:21,070
Yes, he has a pulse.

3623
03:43:21,750 --> 03:43:23,730
Like, he's not fucking dead.

3624
03:43:24,270 --> 03:43:25,310
Like, I'm unsure.

3625
03:43:25,950 --> 03:43:28,890
He's more banged up than what a blow dart would do.

3626
03:43:29,610 --> 03:43:33,650
According to Amy's rules, a blow dart counts as a kill for
the murder mystery.

3627
03:43:34,310 --> 03:43:36,370
My theory, therefore, is plausible.

3628
03:43:37,090 --> 03:43:38,030
Plausible, you say.

3629
03:43:38,190 --> 03:43:39,850
Then why there's so many holes.

3630
03:43:39,870 --> 03:43:41,070
Like what, huh?

3631
03:43:41,430 --> 03:43:41,990
Like what?

3632
03:43:42,650 --> 03:43:43,590
Mr. Smartass?

3633
03:43:44,150 --> 03:43:46,490
You denied these allegations?

3634
03:43:47,430 --> 03:43:48,510
Of course I do.

3635
03:43:49,070 --> 03:43:51,090
Let me present the first fatal flaw.

3636
03:43:52,690 --> 03:44:01,490
If I knocked out Sonic in the conductor's car, then how was
Sonic found in the dining car?

3637
03:44:02,350 --> 03:44:03,410
That's a good point.

3638
03:44:03,630 --> 03:44:05,170
Tails was Vector!

3639
03:44:06,330 --> 03:44:06,870
Vector!

3640
03:44:07,190 --> 03:44:07,970
He's a muscle!

3641
03:44:09,870 --> 03:44:12,270
Oh, the cars and Espa didn't have a key.

3642
03:44:13,070 --> 03:44:15,490
He would have not to take the hidden passage back.

3643
03:44:16,350 --> 03:44:19,770
If he took the hidden passage back, he'd end up back in the
library.

3644
03:44:21,910 --> 03:44:25,390
Doki made a FPS V2, and I know another way it could have
been done.

3645
03:44:26,050 --> 03:44:26,450
Vector!

3646
03:44:27,350 --> 03:44:30,450
What piece of evidence do we need to take a closer look?

3647
03:44:31,370 --> 03:44:32,770
Um, we only have this.

3648
03:44:34,490 --> 03:44:38,210
I only have this, so, like, I don't know.

3649
03:44:39,290 --> 03:44:39,850
Does this mean anything?

3650
03:44:39,870 --> 03:44:56,300
like oh it's not the menu oh it's not the menu wait what

3651
03:45:07,100 --> 03:45:13,800
the map oh okay it was a process of elimination It was the
map.

3652
03:45:13,920 --> 03:45:14,640
The blueprints.

3653
03:45:15,640 --> 03:45:17,360
Yeah, what is my argument?

3654
03:45:17,920 --> 03:45:19,840
We're getting thick Doki made up.

3655
03:45:20,020 --> 03:45:20,800
Yes, me too.

3656
03:45:21,340 --> 03:45:23,140
What does the blueprint mean?

3657
03:45:26,760 --> 03:45:27,300
What?

3658
03:45:27,900 --> 03:45:29,540
What's the blueprint for?

3659
03:45:30,240 --> 03:45:31,960
I'm so confused.

3660
03:45:33,740 --> 03:45:35,060
What could a blueprint do?

3661
03:45:35,440 --> 03:45:36,160
It's just... Oh!

3662
03:45:36,820 --> 03:45:37,240
What?

3663
03:45:37,420 --> 03:45:37,860
I jumped.

3664
03:45:37,960 --> 03:45:39,200
I swear to God, I jumped.

3665
03:45:39,420 --> 03:45:39,940
I jumped.

3666
03:45:42,060 --> 03:45:42,760
Oh my God.

3667
03:45:42,780 --> 03:45:56,200
got think think dookie think what did it mean what did the
blueprint mean i actually don't know i'm so confused oh let

3668
03:45:56,200 --> 03:46:09,060
me grab this real fast in here okay nice we made it we just
have to not die nice there you go we just got it now oh my

3669
03:46:09,060 --> 03:46:14,460
god how did like the fucking level difficulty jump that
Alright, let's take a look.

3670
03:46:15,220 --> 03:46:15,720
What does this mean?

3671
03:46:16,440 --> 03:46:22,320
If Espio didn't take the secret passage to get to the dining
car, then what route did he get to Sonic there?

3672
03:46:23,660 --> 03:46:29,220
There's a path above the conductor car, and it goes all the
way to the dining car?

3673
03:46:30,540 --> 03:46:30,980
Oh!

3674
03:46:31,860 --> 03:46:33,140
I didn't even see that area.

3675
03:46:33,280 --> 03:46:34,380
I didn't even see that, too!

3676
03:46:34,560 --> 03:46:35,180
What the fuck?

3677
03:46:35,300 --> 03:46:37,320
How the fuck was I supposed to notice that?

3678
03:46:38,880 --> 03:46:40,900
Is this some sort of long attic?

3679
03:46:43,640 --> 03:46:44,660
He vented!

3680
03:46:45,660 --> 03:46:48,640
There's a hidden path in the ceiling that leads straight to
the dining car.

3681
03:46:48,820 --> 03:46:49,680
I can't believe it.

3682
03:46:49,980 --> 03:46:51,100
He fucking vented.

3683
03:46:51,800 --> 03:46:53,000
Perhaps you can access it.

3684
03:46:53,340 --> 03:46:54,600
Through the vent over there?

3685
03:46:55,460 --> 03:46:55,820
Oh!

3686
03:46:56,700 --> 03:46:57,160
The vent.

3687
03:46:57,300 --> 03:46:57,660
Of course.

3688
03:46:57,920 --> 03:46:59,400
That must be the entrance to the path.

3689
03:47:00,460 --> 03:47:01,120
Allow me...

3690
03:47:01,120 --> 03:47:01,920
Howdy, y'all.

3691
03:47:02,140 --> 03:47:03,860
Allow me to check it.

3692
03:47:04,340 --> 03:47:05,200
Pretty lady.

3693
03:47:06,080 --> 03:47:07,160
My word.

3694
03:47:07,900 --> 03:47:09,200
There is a path back there.

3695
03:47:09,540 --> 03:47:11,060
And a track, y'all.

3696
03:47:12,700 --> 03:47:13,180
Track?

3697
03:47:13,580 --> 03:47:13,960
How?

3698
03:47:15,400 --> 03:47:19,900
A track for the robot arms, I think, my lady, y'all.

3699
03:47:21,120 --> 03:47:24,780
This must be the path the arms took to move throughout the
train.

3700
03:47:25,240 --> 03:47:27,300
Just got this, but this game seems very forgiven.

3701
03:47:27,480 --> 03:47:29,960
The reason you're playing it, Jesus, honor, man.

3702
03:47:30,060 --> 03:47:30,980
Thank you for the super chat.

3703
03:47:31,100 --> 03:47:31,740
Thank you, thank you.

3704
03:47:32,040 --> 03:47:39,720
So you're saying, so you're saying, I somehow fit with Sonic
in that bed and took him to the dining car.

3705
03:47:42,200 --> 03:47:43,880
Tells You're a smart kid.

3706
03:47:44,180 --> 03:47:47,020
I know you realize we both couldn't fit up there.

3707
03:47:48,520 --> 03:47:49,260
Espio's right.

3708
03:47:49,560 --> 03:47:51,460
This is feeling flimsy, Tails.

3709
03:47:52,520 --> 03:47:53,480
I need an answer.

3710
03:47:54,020 --> 03:47:57,700
My name is getting dragged around here.

3711
03:47:58,400 --> 03:48:00,540
This is pathetic, Tails.

3712
03:48:01,160 --> 03:48:06,300
Just because I know more languages than you doesn't mean you
have to be jealous.

3713
03:48:07,380 --> 03:48:10,660
How on earth would I get Sonic through that bend?

3714
03:48:13,700 --> 03:48:15,480
That has to be the arms at this rate.

3715
03:48:15,600 --> 03:48:16,380
Like, what else?

3716
03:48:18,680 --> 03:48:19,260
Can't do this.

3717
03:48:19,300 --> 03:48:20,400
Doki made a FPS VTube.

3718
03:48:20,540 --> 03:48:21,300
You can do this.

3719
03:48:22,760 --> 03:48:23,120
Objection!

3720
03:48:23,580 --> 03:48:24,540
Oh, think.

3721
03:48:24,800 --> 03:48:25,240
Wait, sorry.

3722
03:48:25,380 --> 03:48:25,880
I can't object.

3723
03:48:25,960 --> 03:48:26,680
Yeah, I'm still thinking.

3724
03:48:26,820 --> 03:48:27,200
Oh, my God.

3725
03:48:27,340 --> 03:48:27,940
There's still one more.

3726
03:48:28,020 --> 03:48:28,580
Okay, here we go.

3727
03:48:29,240 --> 03:48:29,600
Don't worry.

3728
03:48:29,720 --> 03:48:30,320
We got this.

3729
03:48:30,540 --> 03:48:34,360
Wee-oo-wee-oo-wee-wee-wee-wee.

3730
03:48:34,620 --> 03:48:35,980
Oh, wait, what?

3731
03:48:36,080 --> 03:48:37,500
How the fuck did I get hit?

3732
03:48:38,660 --> 03:48:39,380
What the fuck?

3733
03:48:39,440 --> 03:48:40,660
Okay, that scared me, actually.

3734
03:48:42,160 --> 03:48:42,760
Oh, there's...

3735
03:48:42,780 --> 03:48:44,440
too many things going on on my screen.

3736
03:48:44,900 --> 03:48:44,900
No!

3737
03:48:45,300 --> 03:48:46,740
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

3738
03:48:46,740 --> 03:48:49,580
Oh, there's way too many things going on my screen right
now.

3739
03:48:55,600 --> 03:48:57,940
Oh, no, please, I need...

3740
03:48:57,940 --> 03:48:58,340
No!

3741
03:49:02,480 --> 03:49:03,420
How am I good?

3742
03:49:03,660 --> 03:49:04,840
Bro, what?

3743
03:49:05,140 --> 03:49:07,040
Okay, okay, we got this.

3744
03:49:07,900 --> 03:49:09,580
Bro, this is actually really...

3745
03:49:10,720 --> 03:49:12,780
This is the final countdown.

3746
03:49:13,640 --> 03:49:15,080
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

3747
03:49:16,020 --> 03:49:17,340
Oh, this is bad.

3748
03:49:17,480 --> 03:49:17,820
This is bad.

3749
03:49:18,020 --> 03:49:18,600
This is bad.

3750
03:49:19,840 --> 03:49:21,540
It's over, it's so over.

3751
03:49:22,280 --> 03:49:23,520
It's so over.

3752
03:49:25,160 --> 03:49:25,440
No.

3753
03:49:26,660 --> 03:49:27,260
It's over.

3754
03:49:27,540 --> 03:49:28,260
There's no way.

3755
03:49:28,640 --> 03:49:30,320
I got knocked like.

3756
03:49:31,140 --> 03:49:33,940
How about not hitting any of these rings?

3757
03:49:38,600 --> 03:49:40,460
It's so over.

3758
03:49:41,400 --> 03:49:42,460
Oh my god.

3759
03:49:42,720 --> 03:49:46,060
Bro, this is actually a lot difficult than before.

3760
03:49:48,220 --> 03:49:49,560
Like, they're like not.

3761
03:49:49,580 --> 03:49:51,640
Not even generous with the rings.

3762
03:49:51,820 --> 03:49:53,480
That's like the worst part.

3763
03:49:57,520 --> 03:49:58,040
Oh.

3764
03:50:01,510 --> 03:50:02,030
Okay.

3765
03:50:02,550 --> 03:50:03,190
Wait, wait, wait.

3766
03:50:03,410 --> 03:50:03,670
This is it.

3767
03:50:03,750 --> 03:50:04,070
This is it.

3768
03:50:04,370 --> 03:50:04,590
No!

3769
03:50:04,890 --> 03:50:05,270
No!

3770
03:50:05,530 --> 03:50:05,790
No!

3771
03:50:05,930 --> 03:50:06,050
Okay.

3772
03:50:06,210 --> 03:50:06,510
68.

3773
03:50:07,830 --> 03:50:08,350
Okay.

3774
03:50:08,950 --> 03:50:10,390
Just don't fuck it up.

3775
03:50:10,730 --> 03:50:11,730
Don't fuck it up, Doki.

3776
03:50:12,570 --> 03:50:12,910
Yes!

3777
03:50:13,510 --> 03:50:14,050
All right.

3778
03:50:14,110 --> 03:50:14,450
Nice.

3779
03:50:14,910 --> 03:50:15,210
Okay.

3780
03:50:15,670 --> 03:50:17,990
They were definitely not generous at all this time.

3781
03:50:18,990 --> 03:50:19,510
Okay.

3782
03:50:21,530 --> 03:50:23,730
Everybody saw the broken robot arm on the ground, right?

3783
03:50:26,270 --> 03:50:30,230
Clearly a fight broke out here, and one of those robot arms
was a casualty!

3784
03:50:31,170 --> 03:50:34,790
But what if one of broken arms actually caught Sonic?

3785
03:50:35,570 --> 03:50:39,070
Knuckles said there's a track the robot arms use that
continues through the vent.

3786
03:50:39,810 --> 03:50:44,630
A robot arm could have grabbed Sonic, passed out from a blow
dart, and carried him to the dining car.

3787
03:50:47,930 --> 03:50:49,290
Could that be true?

3788
03:50:49,770 --> 03:50:51,170
Could you really do it, Espio?

3789
03:50:51,230 --> 03:50:52,790
Take a look at Sonic.

3790
03:50:53,050 --> 03:50:54,550
He's clearly banged up.

3791
03:50:55,530 --> 03:50:58,730
Could the fight happen between Sonic and the robot arms?

3792
03:51:00,150 --> 03:51:01,770
I can see that.

3793
03:51:02,050 --> 03:51:03,670
Those arms do look powerful.

3794
03:51:05,370 --> 03:51:07,030
Sonic doesn't fall easily.

3795
03:51:07,370 --> 03:51:11,150
But if he's woozy from a blow dart, the arms could have
gotten him.

3796
03:51:12,310 --> 03:51:13,710
Interesting theory, Tails.

3797
03:51:14,150 --> 03:51:17,590
But you have to admit, these are a lot of coincidences.

3798
03:51:19,050 --> 03:51:21,210
I might not be able to link everything directly to S.

3799
03:51:21,230 --> 03:51:33,910
yet but I found one inconsistency what kind of what kind of
inconsistency someone here received false information I

3800
03:51:33,910 --> 03:51:45,630
believe that information comes from SBO who received that
information wait what

3801
03:51:53,090 --> 03:51:53,490
Okay.

3802
03:51:57,050 --> 03:51:57,990
Oh, Amy.

3803
03:51:58,630 --> 03:51:59,310
Wait, what?

3804
03:52:00,150 --> 03:52:01,710
Amy, you see the hot scoop.

3805
03:52:01,950 --> 03:52:02,530
Did you not?

3806
03:52:03,690 --> 03:52:05,430
I think it's time you tell us where that scoop came.

3807
03:52:05,470 --> 03:52:07,570
Okay, I got a little confused with the way they worded that.

3808
03:52:07,910 --> 03:52:10,510
I was like, wait, I thought we already know it's Amy.

3809
03:52:10,910 --> 03:52:16,090
So, like, I was like, I got the way they worded that was so
confusing.

3810
03:52:18,670 --> 03:52:20,630
Tails, you're right.

3811
03:52:23,610 --> 03:52:31,230
Esma told me Shadow was locking doors to trap Sonic but we
found out Shadow was trying to keep me from discovering my

3812
03:52:31,230 --> 03:52:35,190
birthday surprise that scoop came from you Espio?

3813
03:52:35,730 --> 03:52:36,470
How dare you?

3814
03:52:39,790 --> 03:52:41,110
Word, they're going to do the Phoenix right?

3815
03:52:41,230 --> 03:52:41,830
Like breakdown.

3816
03:52:43,690 --> 03:52:44,690
No, of course not Amy.

3817
03:52:45,170 --> 03:52:46,450
Must have her misheard me.

3818
03:52:46,950 --> 03:52:47,530
You know her.

3819
03:52:47,710 --> 03:52:49,370
She's so ditsy.

3820
03:52:49,610 --> 03:52:50,310
Hee hee.

3821
03:52:50,870 --> 03:52:51,610
Misheard you?

3822
03:52:52,110 --> 03:52:52,770
Are you calling me stupid?

3823
03:52:52,790 --> 03:52:53,510
on my birthday.

3824
03:52:54,890 --> 03:52:58,570
Yes, I said, Sonic's going to get trapped with all these
locked doors.

3825
03:52:59,290 --> 03:53:01,630
I was just looking out for my fellow passenger safety.

3826
03:53:02,210 --> 03:53:03,310
I didn't blame shadow.

3827
03:53:04,070 --> 03:53:05,110
The ultimate life form.

3828
03:53:06,210 --> 03:53:07,170
I don't know, SBO.

3829
03:53:08,770 --> 03:53:08,950
What?

3830
03:53:09,770 --> 03:53:13,310
The evidence might not be airtight, but there's a lot being
thrown at you.

3831
03:53:13,430 --> 03:53:14,330
That makes sense.

3832
03:53:15,630 --> 03:53:16,750
I have to agree.

3833
03:53:17,110 --> 03:53:20,170
You want us to believe you're lazily reading the whole time.

3834
03:53:20,710 --> 03:53:22,770
You detective ninja know something.

3835
03:53:22,790 --> 03:53:35,410
languages while you were stationed in a room with a hidden
passage and now you're lying to me on my birthday of all

3836
03:53:35,410 --> 03:53:45,930
days he better have a really good birthday present
gaslighting works for sure look SBO is clearly not very good

3837
03:53:45,930 --> 03:53:52,210
at gaslighting and now you're lying I believe the murder
used the train's controls to move Sonic from the conductor

3838
03:53:52,210 --> 03:53:54,490
car to the dining car.

3839
03:53:57,570 --> 03:54:00,770
And lie to Amy, casting further blame on Shadow for no other
reason.

3840
03:54:00,910 --> 03:54:01,930
I can't believe it!

3841
03:54:02,310 --> 03:54:04,570
Espio wouldn't let Amy win on her birthday.

3842
03:54:04,990 --> 03:54:06,190
That is so fucked up.

3843
03:54:06,410 --> 03:54:07,590
It's literally her birthday.

3844
03:54:09,390 --> 03:54:11,130
When examining everyone's...

3845
03:54:11,130 --> 03:54:13,230
Wait, is Amy's birthday actually on April 4th?

3846
03:54:14,570 --> 03:54:16,690
When clearly stands out as the weakest.

3847
03:54:17,170 --> 03:54:20,930
I believe it's clear to everyone that it can only have been
one person.

3848
03:54:22,790 --> 03:54:23,370
God!

3849
03:54:24,850 --> 03:54:26,170
Professor Lee, it was you!

3850
03:54:26,890 --> 03:54:27,490
Espio!

3851
03:54:30,810 --> 03:54:32,930
This reminds me of a puzzle.

3852
03:54:34,970 --> 03:54:38,570
You were the one who murdered Sonic the Hedgehog!

3853
03:54:38,910 --> 03:54:40,370
They did the thing!

3854
03:54:46,620 --> 03:54:47,560
So...

3855
03:54:47,560 --> 03:54:48,340
Oh!

3856
03:54:53,890 --> 03:54:54,450
Oh!

3857
03:54:55,450 --> 03:54:56,050
Oh!

3858
03:55:01,050 --> 03:55:18,710
Hey guys Sonic you're okay Sonic and just as we saw the
mystery Espio was the murderer Right He's not okay Sonic

3859
03:55:18,710 --> 03:55:32,230
Espio jumps me in the conductor car Bro what the fuck is
this Dang it You got me A blow dart, though.

3860
03:55:33,150 --> 03:55:33,290
Really?

3861
03:55:34,390 --> 03:55:36,130
It's non-lethal poison.

3862
03:55:36,570 --> 03:55:38,170
You'll just be sleepy for a while.

3863
03:55:39,490 --> 03:55:41,550
Great, I could use a nap.

3864
03:55:42,830 --> 03:55:43,370
No, wait.

3865
03:55:43,610 --> 03:55:44,910
There's something important.

3866
03:55:46,770 --> 03:55:48,790
Espio left me there.

3867
03:55:49,170 --> 03:55:50,310
Bro, he's like not okay.

3868
03:55:51,790 --> 03:55:53,670
Someone get him to the hospital.

3869
03:55:53,890 --> 03:55:54,790
He is not okay.

3870
03:55:57,690 --> 03:55:58,910
Something important?

3871
03:55:59,870 --> 03:56:01,630
I need everyone to listen.

3872
03:56:02,910 --> 03:56:03,730
The trains.

3873
03:56:04,470 --> 03:56:04,650
What?

3874
03:56:05,710 --> 03:56:06,490
What's that?

3875
03:56:08,290 --> 03:56:10,310
Sonic, are you feeling alright?

3876
03:56:11,730 --> 03:56:12,810
Do you need to lie back?

3877
03:56:12,930 --> 03:56:13,990
Do you need to lie back down?

3878
03:56:14,810 --> 03:56:15,110
No.

3879
03:56:15,650 --> 03:56:18,630
We need to all get off this train.

3880
03:56:19,870 --> 03:56:21,710
We're not safe.

3881
03:56:22,570 --> 03:56:23,130
What?

3882
03:56:24,190 --> 03:56:25,850
When I...

3883
03:56:25,850 --> 03:56:28,150
Oh, it's Eggman's robots?

3884
03:56:28,370 --> 03:56:28,970
Oh!

3885
03:56:29,870 --> 03:56:30,390
I knew that.

3886
03:56:30,450 --> 03:56:31,470
I was just testing you guys.

3887
03:56:32,090 --> 03:56:34,170
I was just testing you guys on Sonic Lore.

3888
03:56:35,410 --> 03:56:37,270
Wait, is the conductor even a...

3889
03:56:37,270 --> 03:56:38,890
Is the conductor even real?

3890
03:56:41,270 --> 03:56:44,130
He was so excited to tell me all about the features of the
train.

3891
03:56:46,390 --> 03:56:48,010
But what he was telling me...

3892
03:56:48,010 --> 03:56:48,890
Was the conductor?

3893
03:56:49,890 --> 03:56:52,190
Was the conductor Eggman all along?

3894
03:56:54,850 --> 03:56:55,890
I had a bad feeling.

3895
03:56:56,330 --> 03:56:57,850
I had to see the power source.

3896
03:56:58,310 --> 03:56:59,790
The conductor hadn't even seen it.

3897
03:56:59,870 --> 03:57:08,230
When we took a look, we realized The train's powered by a
flicky A flicky?

3898
03:57:08,650 --> 03:57:09,650
The tiny animal?

3899
03:57:10,550 --> 03:57:16,710
There's only one person twisted enough to use a flicky as a
power source Dr. Eggman!

3900
03:57:17,990 --> 03:57:20,350
I told the conductor the train needed to be destroyed.

3901
03:57:20,830 --> 03:57:21,590
He refused.

3902
03:57:22,430 --> 03:57:24,990
The way the conductor was describing it Is more than simple.

3903
03:57:26,490 --> 03:57:27,530
It's the conductor's friend.

3904
03:57:28,070 --> 03:57:29,850
The train is his co-conviction.

3905
03:57:29,870 --> 03:57:30,510
conductor.

3906
03:57:31,110 --> 03:57:32,490
You're not serious.

3907
03:57:32,870 --> 03:57:33,770
Wait, where is the conductor?

3908
03:57:35,350 --> 03:57:42,490
They started telling me in that interview right as we saw
the flicky, I felt sting in my shoulder.

3909
03:57:43,290 --> 03:57:45,370
It was, wait then where the fuck was the conductor?

3910
03:57:45,570 --> 03:57:47,430
Wouldn't SBO see the conductor?

3911
03:57:51,010 --> 03:57:51,510
Ooh.

3912
03:57:54,350 --> 03:57:55,470
SBO left.

3913
03:57:56,410 --> 03:57:58,870
Lights in the room started to glow red.

3914
03:58:00,930 --> 03:58:03,330
Oh, evil, evil hands.

3915
03:58:04,190 --> 03:58:04,670
Oh, no.

3916
03:58:05,510 --> 03:58:06,950
Not the evil hands.

3917
03:58:07,610 --> 03:58:08,350
It is.

3918
03:58:08,490 --> 03:58:09,510
Oh, there he is.

3919
03:58:09,770 --> 03:58:10,270
Oh, okay.

3920
03:58:10,370 --> 03:58:11,070
There's a conductor.

3921
03:58:11,530 --> 03:58:12,750
What are you doing?

3922
03:58:13,550 --> 03:58:16,610
I knew something was wrong and stood up.

3923
03:58:18,050 --> 03:58:19,790
The arms came for me next.

3924
03:58:21,550 --> 03:58:24,170
I spin dashed through the right robot arm.

3925
03:58:24,570 --> 03:58:26,610
Sliced it off the rail it was on.

3926
03:58:28,350 --> 03:58:29,590
I'm amazed I was able to do any of that.

3927
03:58:30,550 --> 03:58:33,810
But another robot arm managed to grab me and pin me to the
floor.

3928
03:58:35,450 --> 03:58:37,090
Ah, wait, where did he go, though?

3929
03:58:37,630 --> 03:58:42,710
The conductor screamed as the arms approached him, but I was
hit quite a bit before it got to me.

3930
03:58:45,330 --> 03:58:46,330
Wait, it's not over?

3931
03:58:46,930 --> 03:58:48,210
Bro, we solved the mystery.

3932
03:58:49,030 --> 03:58:49,990
How much more?

3933
03:58:52,930 --> 03:58:55,870
I thought this was a simple murder mystery.

3934
03:58:57,550 --> 03:58:58,430
Oh, no.

3935
03:58:59,230 --> 03:58:59,670
Oh, no.

3936
03:59:04,550 --> 03:59:18,770
Everyone have something to admit Now for the real Tutorials
over Alright Yes we know I murdered Sonic the Hedgehog Yeah

3937
03:59:18,770 --> 03:59:29,790
we already knew that man Guys we did it We finished the
tutorial This situation is kind of so serious Why would you

3938
03:59:29,790 --> 03:59:38,830
not tell us just tell us I thought that's how the murder
games work Darling You shoot someone with blow dart They die

3939
03:59:40,330 --> 03:59:41,550
Are you crazy?

3940
03:59:41,990 --> 03:59:47,450
It's just a make believe game No one should get hit with my
blow dart Okay she should have put that in the rules She's

3941
03:59:47,450 --> 03:59:54,690
literally like in a room filled with people That have like
killed things like And like are very competitive Like she

3942
03:59:54,690 --> 04:00:03,410
should literally clarify that In the TOS or something I was
just following the rules Yeah see Oh!

3943
04:00:06,030 --> 04:00:08,790
Oh, Eggman corrupted the rules.

3944
04:00:09,490 --> 04:00:10,970
It's laced with a non-lethal.

3945
04:00:12,570 --> 04:00:14,510
Are we sure it's non-lethal?

3946
04:00:17,670 --> 04:00:19,150
What is that?

3947
04:00:20,070 --> 04:00:23,570
It says, use this blow dart on Sonic Station in the Conduct.

3948
04:00:23,690 --> 04:00:26,750
I'm surprised Eggman actually made it non-lethal, you know?

3949
04:00:27,210 --> 04:00:30,190
Like, he could have easily got rid of him once and for all.

3950
04:00:31,530 --> 04:00:33,110
for choosing the Mirage Express.

3951
04:00:34,970 --> 04:00:35,910
What is this, instructions?

3952
04:00:36,910 --> 04:00:39,050
I was giving the blow dart along with that card.

3953
04:00:39,910 --> 04:00:40,930
It's signed, staff.

3954
04:00:41,670 --> 04:00:42,630
Who gave this to you?

3955
04:00:43,270 --> 04:00:44,190
Come to think of it.

3956
04:00:44,850 --> 04:00:46,930
One of the robotic arms handed it to me.

3957
04:00:48,470 --> 04:00:50,130
What picture do you allow it on a train?

3958
04:00:50,810 --> 04:00:52,150
What is the larger picture here?

3959
04:00:52,570 --> 04:00:54,270
Oh, who is Shrek?

3960
04:00:54,350 --> 04:00:54,930
I wonder.

3961
04:00:55,250 --> 04:00:57,130
Who is the main villain in Sonic the Universe?

3962
04:00:57,910 --> 04:00:58,930
Amy, oh my gosh.

3963
04:00:59,190 --> 04:01:02,630
Okay, I've been, if Tails said that, I would have been like,
What the fuck?

3964
04:01:03,810 --> 04:01:04,750
Who or what?

3965
04:01:05,750 --> 04:01:06,510
Doki Meadow.

3966
04:01:07,070 --> 04:01:07,690
FBS VTube.

3967
04:01:08,010 --> 04:01:10,890
Who do you think attacked Sonic and had an SBO to blow dart?

3968
04:01:11,610 --> 04:01:13,250
The train itself.

3969
04:01:15,370 --> 04:01:15,930
The conductor.

3970
04:01:16,350 --> 04:01:18,850
The conductor was secret Eggman.

3971
04:01:20,510 --> 04:01:20,750
Oh.

3972
04:01:21,130 --> 04:01:21,630
Okay.

3973
04:01:23,330 --> 04:01:25,210
Something wanted Sonic out of the picture and for good.

3974
04:01:25,250 --> 04:01:25,430
Wow.

3975
04:01:25,490 --> 04:01:27,010
So I think the train.

3976
04:01:27,050 --> 04:01:27,490
Oh, okay.

3977
04:01:27,530 --> 04:01:28,630
You won't even let me pick.

3978
04:01:28,930 --> 04:01:29,270
Oh.

3979
04:01:31,790 --> 04:01:40,150
Bro, it would have been a better plot twist if it was Eggman
disguised as the conductor and then he, like, pretended to

3980
04:01:40,150 --> 04:01:40,870
get caught.

3981
04:01:41,210 --> 04:01:43,270
They didn't even let me pick!

3982
04:01:45,370 --> 04:01:46,610
Oh, my God!

3983
04:01:48,850 --> 04:01:52,430
You got the 50-50 rod.

3984
04:01:53,030 --> 04:01:54,170
Oh, my God.

3985
04:01:55,490 --> 04:01:58,830
That would have been a better plot twist.

3986
04:02:00,230 --> 04:02:01,510
First, we learned the truth.

3987
04:02:01,530 --> 04:02:03,070
and now it's out to get us?

3988
04:02:03,130 --> 04:02:05,670
Yes, because it's a bad fucking train!

3989
04:02:06,850 --> 04:02:09,950
Once again, you keep saying the most ridiculous nonsense.

3990
04:02:11,050 --> 04:02:13,970
You're seriously convinced the train has been out to get us?

3991
04:02:14,650 --> 04:02:16,850
I don't know what the train's full of tense is.

3992
04:02:17,210 --> 04:02:17,570
AI.

3993
04:02:17,850 --> 04:02:18,330
I knew it.

3994
04:02:18,490 --> 04:02:19,330
Down with AI.

3995
04:02:19,910 --> 04:02:22,610
I fucking knew AI was gonna take over soon.

3996
04:02:23,130 --> 04:02:25,450
But the player's been tampering in our murder mystery
stream.

3997
04:02:26,350 --> 04:02:26,830
Train.

3998
04:02:27,730 --> 04:02:27,990
Hmm.

3999
04:02:28,630 --> 04:02:30,250
Come on and show yourself!

4000
04:02:30,430 --> 04:02:31,110
It's my birthday!

4001
04:02:32,750 --> 04:02:33,190
Amy!

4002
04:02:34,090 --> 04:02:34,890
It's my birthday!

4003
04:02:35,650 --> 04:02:37,450
And I don't need you messing with it!

4004
04:02:38,570 --> 04:02:40,190
Amy sitting on the wall with her hammer.

4005
04:02:42,730 --> 04:02:43,590
I'm with you, Amy.

4006
04:02:43,770 --> 04:02:44,730
This train can have it.

4007
04:02:46,010 --> 04:02:48,630
Come on, there's gotta be another way to get the train's
attention.

4008
04:02:49,790 --> 04:02:50,830
What was that?

4009
04:02:52,570 --> 04:02:53,430
Did I do it?

4010
04:02:53,750 --> 04:02:55,050
Oh, no, the train Anki.

4011
04:02:56,330 --> 04:02:57,590
The train is Anki, guys.

4012
04:02:58,270 --> 04:02:59,510
Whoa, what did you do?

4013
04:03:00,670 --> 04:03:01,350
Is that...

4014
04:03:01,350 --> 04:03:01,910
The conductor?

4015
04:03:05,920 --> 04:03:06,880
Wait, he's not even...

4016
04:03:06,880 --> 04:03:08,920
Okay, like, his mouth is...

4017
04:03:08,920 --> 04:03:11,280
His mouth isn't even, like, muffled.

4018
04:03:11,360 --> 04:03:12,700
Like, why are you...

4019
04:03:13,480 --> 04:03:15,000
Here, I can get him down.

4020
04:03:15,360 --> 04:03:16,600
Don't touch him!

4021
04:03:17,360 --> 04:03:18,760
Oh, he's...

4022
04:03:18,760 --> 04:03:19,900
The arms!

4023
04:03:20,320 --> 04:03:22,160
The arms don't want the conductor to leave.

4024
04:03:22,480 --> 04:03:23,980
He's the train wave!

4025
04:03:24,540 --> 04:03:27,180
I thought I was the train wave.

4026
04:03:27,640 --> 04:03:29,120
But it was the train.

4027
04:03:29,700 --> 04:03:31,820
That's the train wave!

4028
04:03:36,300 --> 04:03:38,400
Is the train talking?

4029
04:03:40,620 --> 04:03:42,860
Of course I can talk.

4030
04:03:43,180 --> 04:03:46,780
You fools were too distracted playing your little game to
figure it out.

4031
04:03:47,680 --> 04:03:48,820
We were right, weren't we?

4032
04:03:49,700 --> 04:03:50,420
What are you plotting?

4033
04:03:51,100 --> 04:03:53,800
I'm taking all of you to Eggman's base.

4034
04:03:55,100 --> 04:03:56,560
Where you will rot!

4035
04:03:57,720 --> 04:03:58,360
Eggman?

4036
04:03:59,020 --> 04:04:02,940
After I deliver your annoying party right to his egg
fortress.

4037
04:04:03,880 --> 04:04:04,560
Annoying!

4038
04:04:05,380 --> 04:04:06,920
She has a birthday pass!

4039
04:04:07,440 --> 04:04:10,280
The conductor and I will be free to laugh and play games.

4040
04:04:10,680 --> 04:04:13,720
Ride the open rails like we always planned.

4041
04:04:14,160 --> 04:04:14,560
No!

4042
04:04:18,560 --> 04:04:21,860
Oh, train wife!

4043
04:04:25,220 --> 04:04:26,320
What are you?

4044
04:04:26,820 --> 04:04:27,420
Enough!

4045
04:04:29,220 --> 04:04:31,660
The train's making up speed.

4046
04:04:33,080 --> 04:04:34,640
Everyone, everyone, grab something.

4047
04:04:36,360 --> 04:04:38,450
Which one of these buttons Turn the trains off?

4048
04:04:40,580 --> 04:04:40,900
Sonic!

4049
04:04:45,140 --> 04:04:50,340
Me and my train husband Say put until we arrive.

4050
04:04:52,000 --> 04:04:54,220
I am the yonder Train wife.

4051
04:04:55,240 --> 04:04:55,700
Goodbye.

4052
04:04:57,300 --> 04:04:57,680
Ah!

4053
04:04:58,400 --> 04:04:59,120
Wow!

4054
04:04:59,360 --> 04:05:00,100
Oh, wow.

4055
04:05:04,060 --> 04:05:06,500
I can't keep my footing.

4056
04:05:07,520 --> 04:05:07,720
Ah!

4057
04:05:12,490 --> 04:05:13,710
Am I going to meet A-man?

4058
04:05:15,250 --> 04:05:16,890
There's more?

4059
04:05:19,510 --> 04:05:19,950
What?

4060
04:05:20,510 --> 04:05:21,350
What are...

4061
04:05:21,870 --> 04:05:24,710
This was supposed to be a two-hour game.

4062
04:05:26,690 --> 04:05:31,850
A bunch of evidence has fallen out of my pocket.

4063
04:05:35,270 --> 04:05:42,010
My head tells Amy, Is anyone here?

4064
04:05:42,570 --> 04:05:43,310
Hello?

4065
04:05:45,850 --> 04:05:46,490
Hello?

4066
04:05:47,770 --> 04:05:50,810
I thought this game would end in two hours.

4067
04:05:51,730 --> 04:05:53,610
That's why I picked it.

4068
04:05:54,750 --> 04:05:58,430
No need to yell, but...

4069
04:05:59,290 --> 04:05:59,930
Sonic?

4070
04:06:00,270 --> 04:06:00,790
I'm so sorry.

4071
04:06:01,190 --> 04:06:01,850
Are you okay?

4072
04:06:03,030 --> 04:06:04,150
Hanging in there.

4073
04:06:04,310 --> 04:06:08,010
It seems the train arms threw us back in the dining car.

4074
04:06:09,810 --> 04:06:11,290
That was the tutorial.

4075
04:06:11,750 --> 04:06:13,330
Now the real game starts.

4076
04:06:14,430 --> 04:06:21,010
everyone else great question i like how like in the end we
actually have like i was like it's funny that the sonic game

4077
04:06:21,010 --> 04:06:29,670
doesn't have a lot of sonic and then the game in the end was
like no no no obligatory sonic here but for now are you all

4078
04:06:29,670 --> 04:06:40,850
right sonic the hedgehog asking about me i'm special i feel
terrible i'm doing amazing you know what he should know i'm

4079
04:06:40,850 --> 04:06:45,650
he should not know that i have weakness inside me Amazing,
huh?

4080
04:06:46,250 --> 04:06:49,010
He might have to share a bit of that enthusiasm with me.

4081
04:06:49,970 --> 04:06:50,410
Am I over?

4082
04:06:50,610 --> 04:06:51,370
Wait, it's okay.

4083
04:06:51,890 --> 04:06:52,550
Look, look, see?

4084
04:06:52,690 --> 04:06:53,970
He's giving me a thumbs up.

4085
04:06:54,850 --> 04:06:55,170
See?

4086
04:06:55,370 --> 04:06:56,530
He thinks I'm cool now.

4087
04:06:57,210 --> 04:06:59,090
Let's get our barons to take a look around.

4088
04:06:59,410 --> 04:06:59,990
Good idea.

4089
04:07:00,230 --> 04:07:01,090
Leap the way.

4090
04:07:02,210 --> 04:07:03,690
Alright, wait, what the fuck?

4091
04:07:03,850 --> 04:07:05,870
The arms are still, like, working?

4092
04:07:07,490 --> 04:07:07,950
Okay.

4093
04:07:08,290 --> 04:07:09,210
How do we get out?

4094
04:07:12,350 --> 04:07:14,110
That yellow glow is chilling.

4095
04:07:14,430 --> 04:07:16,910
I miss when just showing us the weather.

4096
04:07:17,930 --> 04:07:20,330
Well, that's better than the yellow glow.

4097
04:07:20,450 --> 04:07:21,410
Oh, it's the Eggman!

4098
04:07:24,190 --> 04:07:24,790
Hello?

4099
04:07:25,510 --> 04:07:26,110
Hello?

4100
04:07:27,190 --> 04:07:28,010
Anyone here?

4101
04:07:28,850 --> 04:07:30,730
Why is no one responding to me?

4102
04:07:32,750 --> 04:07:34,850
I missed the yellow glow already.

4103
04:07:35,850 --> 04:07:39,050
You got some nerve showing up here, Egghead.

4104
04:07:41,450 --> 04:07:43,210
You spiky blue pest.

4105
04:07:44,430 --> 04:07:47,470
You finally, Jim Carrey, oh my god, Jim Carrey.

4106
04:07:48,770 --> 04:07:52,330
Seems you finally taking passage on one of my passenger
trains.

4107
04:07:53,610 --> 04:07:54,490
You own this train?

4108
04:07:55,010 --> 04:07:56,570
I mean, obviously he created this train.

4109
04:07:57,290 --> 04:07:58,430
Who the heck are you?

4110
04:07:58,830 --> 04:07:59,750
Don't talk to me.

4111
04:08:00,110 --> 04:08:01,550
You're not famous enough.

4112
04:08:02,090 --> 04:08:05,890
Talk to me when you have 10,000 subscribers.

4113
04:08:07,790 --> 04:08:10,630
They certainly didn't talk about you in my interview.

4114
04:08:11,370 --> 04:08:13,130
My involvement isn't well known.

4115
04:08:13,750 --> 04:08:14,270
Civilian.

4116
04:08:15,230 --> 04:08:16,150
Alrighty then.

4117
04:08:16,490 --> 04:08:19,070
The infrastructure in your towns just wasn't cutting it.

4118
04:08:19,490 --> 04:08:21,650
What if I were to build Igmanland?

4119
04:08:21,830 --> 04:08:23,710
These problems would need to be sorting out.

4120
04:08:24,290 --> 04:08:26,470
So I courageously got involved.

4121
04:08:28,090 --> 04:08:29,890
I converted some cargo trains into...

4122
04:08:29,890 --> 04:08:30,930
Wait, so he was helping.

4123
04:08:31,270 --> 04:08:31,490
What?

4124
04:08:31,650 --> 04:08:32,830
He was helping the economy.

4125
04:08:33,790 --> 04:08:37,070
For the sake of the public, it's just more useful for future
schemes.

4126
04:08:37,190 --> 04:08:38,790
Oh my god, he's so nice.

4127
04:08:39,210 --> 04:08:43,970
He helped the city's economy by fixing the public
transportation.

4128
04:08:44,670 --> 04:08:48,350
Let me guess another death egg, Dr. Predictable.

4129
04:08:49,510 --> 04:08:51,630
The people fear giant spears.

4130
04:08:52,010 --> 04:08:52,970
It's science.

4131
04:08:54,290 --> 04:08:55,270
Let's cut to a chase.

4132
04:08:55,810 --> 04:08:56,650
We're our friends.

4133
04:08:57,730 --> 04:09:02,030
Judging by my security cameras, your pathetic friends are
all locked in the cars.

4134
04:09:02,190 --> 04:09:02,970
They were stationed in.

4135
04:09:03,030 --> 04:09:03,890
Wait, how does he know?

4136
04:09:04,290 --> 04:09:04,750
Wait, what?

4137
04:09:05,210 --> 04:09:06,230
Oh yeah, he was controlling.

4138
04:09:07,030 --> 04:09:08,950
Controlling our fucking murder mystery.

4139
04:09:09,410 --> 04:09:11,650
Seems you managed to make the train quite upset.

4140
04:09:12,610 --> 04:09:13,990
Do you not know this was happening?

4141
04:09:15,050 --> 04:09:24,170
heavens no i'm only now getting caught up i'm too far busy
to notice what a passenger train is up to you see the

4142
04:09:24,170 --> 04:09:33,590
capability is normally very basic just kill sonic the
hedgehog that's so cute it's just like the first sonic game

4143
04:09:33,590 --> 04:09:42,210
but for a luxury train i want to be sure things ran without
my supervision and report to me if any of you happened to be

4144
04:09:42,210 --> 04:09:45,650
aboard intellectual thought.

4145
04:09:46,190 --> 04:09:46,950
It's extraordinary.

4146
04:09:47,370 --> 04:09:51,190
A feat only accomplished by my genius, because he has a
doctorate.

4147
04:09:52,090 --> 04:09:52,990
So this confirms it.

4148
04:09:53,150 --> 04:09:55,010
The train really is sentient.

4149
04:09:58,430 --> 04:10:01,750
Except this to say, your capture is innovative.

4150
04:10:02,450 --> 04:10:07,250
You are not a train that desires nothing more than to
deliver you all to me.

4151
04:10:09,750 --> 04:10:11,250
See, I got thinking.

4152
04:10:11,630 --> 04:10:14,890
I might need it to manufacture motivation beyond
programming.

4153
04:10:15,830 --> 04:10:17,850
So I made him fall in love with the conductor.

4154
04:10:21,210 --> 04:10:22,710
It's good for productivity.

4155
04:10:23,450 --> 04:10:25,830
So I instituted a bounty upon my army.

4156
04:10:26,530 --> 04:10:30,590
First to capture your pathetic creature gets a generous
award.

4157
04:10:32,390 --> 04:10:35,890
The train wants to deliver us to Eggman for a reward?

4158
04:10:36,650 --> 04:10:38,750
Most of my robots ask for something simple.

4159
04:10:40,270 --> 04:10:41,350
Like my autograph.

4160
04:10:42,970 --> 04:10:43,530
Or whatever.

4161
04:10:44,210 --> 04:10:45,790
A highly intelligent train.

4162
04:10:46,610 --> 04:10:49,430
They may ask for something more interesting.

4163
04:10:50,430 --> 04:10:52,430
The train wants to be hot!

4164
04:10:56,070 --> 04:10:57,590
I can see it.

4165
04:10:58,210 --> 04:11:00,350
As much as I like to reward programs.

4166
04:11:00,510 --> 04:11:02,730
Are you done blabbering, Doc?

4167
04:11:04,770 --> 04:11:09,910
They want to, the train want to be put in like a hot Android
dog wife thing.

4168
04:11:10,510 --> 04:11:14,190
And so like, the train can kiss the conductor and be...

4169
04:11:14,210 --> 04:11:19,230
Like, not just train wife, but, like, regular wife, you
know?

4170
04:11:19,930 --> 04:11:22,570
You can never just win silently, can you?

4171
04:11:23,110 --> 04:11:28,210
When you're dragged to my base, you'll regret the day you
ever crossed me, Hedgehog.

4172
04:11:29,510 --> 04:11:30,610
I already do.

4173
04:11:30,810 --> 04:11:31,790
Get lost!

4174
04:11:33,190 --> 04:11:33,530
Ciao.

4175
04:11:34,670 --> 04:11:35,870
He always knows how to get under him.

4176
04:11:35,930 --> 04:11:36,770
Why is he blushing?

4177
04:11:42,010 --> 04:11:44,110
Why the fuck is he sorry?

4178
04:11:44,210 --> 04:11:48,810
I just got off the call of my boyfriend Eggman.

4179
04:11:53,430 --> 04:11:55,110
This is tough.

4180
04:11:55,670 --> 04:11:59,250
The train has a motivation in being made by Eggman.

4181
04:11:59,390 --> 04:12:00,510
It's no doubt powerful.

4182
04:12:01,410 --> 04:12:03,130
Not to mention we're all separated.

4183
04:12:04,990 --> 04:12:06,430
What am I supposed to think?

4184
04:12:06,930 --> 04:12:10,850
The train purposely had Sonic knocked out so it could
deliver us to Eggman.

4185
04:12:11,650 --> 04:12:13,970
This whole time we were all in danger.

4186
04:12:14,210 --> 04:12:15,490
And I went along with it.

4187
04:12:17,250 --> 04:12:18,410
Sonic was really hurt.

4188
04:12:18,910 --> 04:12:20,550
That conductor's been captured.

4189
04:12:21,230 --> 04:12:22,530
Should I have been more assertive early?

4190
04:12:22,650 --> 04:12:23,790
Bro, what would you do?

4191
04:12:23,870 --> 04:12:24,590
What would you have done?

4192
04:12:24,730 --> 04:12:25,290
What would you have done?

4193
04:12:25,410 --> 04:12:27,770
You literally, you are nothing in this train.

4194
04:12:28,330 --> 04:12:32,010
Like, I didn't try hard.

4195
04:12:32,090 --> 04:12:33,610
No, I tried as hard as I can.

4196
04:12:33,690 --> 04:12:35,410
I'm just a fucking regular Sonic OC.

4197
04:12:36,270 --> 04:12:37,890
They're the same answer!

4198
04:12:41,150 --> 04:12:43,310
They're the same answer!

4199
04:12:46,750 --> 04:12:48,170
Am I a fault here?

4200
04:12:51,970 --> 04:12:53,190
Okay, yeah, I knew Sonic.

4201
04:12:53,270 --> 04:12:54,490
Okay, that was sort of my fault.

4202
04:12:54,670 --> 04:12:56,730
I knew Sonic was hurt all the time.

4203
04:12:59,590 --> 04:13:00,030
Hey.

4204
04:13:01,970 --> 04:13:04,250
I can tell the situation's getting to you.

4205
04:13:04,970 --> 04:13:05,750
Oh, yeah, sorry.

4206
04:13:06,070 --> 04:13:07,330
I get it.

4207
04:13:07,570 --> 04:13:08,750
The road's getting tough.

4208
04:13:09,090 --> 04:13:11,390
It's easy to question the decisions I got you here.

4209
04:13:11,730 --> 04:13:15,810
But when negative thoughts hit you, Don't be sad.

4210
04:13:18,430 --> 04:13:20,930
Sonic, this is terrible advice.

4211
04:13:23,310 --> 04:13:26,310
But when negative thoughts hit you, let it pass.

4212
04:13:26,590 --> 04:13:28,090
Just stop being sad.

4213
04:13:28,610 --> 04:13:29,390
Fucking hells.

4214
04:13:32,350 --> 04:13:34,010
Depression is safe.

4215
04:13:34,410 --> 04:13:35,490
Thank you, Sonic.

4216
04:13:36,390 --> 04:13:40,790
I need you here helping me think this through before I do
something rash.

4217
04:13:41,350 --> 04:13:42,350
I can't believe it.

4218
04:13:42,430 --> 04:13:43,890
Sonic cured my depression.

4219
04:13:45,170 --> 04:13:48,490
See, I'm one of those Leap before you think kind of guys.

4220
04:13:49,250 --> 04:13:51,870
Have you tried not being depressed?

4221
04:13:52,970 --> 04:13:53,850
Thanks, Sonic!

4222
04:13:54,390 --> 04:13:56,130
Now I will never be depressed!

4223
04:13:56,630 --> 04:13:57,530
Okay, you're right.

4224
04:14:00,310 --> 04:14:02,350
Let's keep moving and make things right.

4225
04:14:02,570 --> 04:14:03,390
I'm cured.

4226
04:14:03,690 --> 04:14:06,210
Thank you, Sonic, for telling me Breathe.

4227
04:14:06,710 --> 04:14:06,910
Okay.

4228
04:14:09,530 --> 04:14:10,050
Alright.

4229
04:14:10,590 --> 04:14:13,950
We gotta get to the conductor's car before the train
arrives.

4230
04:14:14,210 --> 04:14:22,310
is that egg of his face you should switch your therapist out
for sonic at the youtube chat thank you guys i don't need to

4231
04:14:22,310 --> 04:14:31,690
go to therapy anymore sonic told me to stop being sad i'm
fucking cured the toys have been heavily fortified how do we

4232
04:14:31,690 --> 04:14:33,430
get through just use your fucking spin dash

4233
04:14:36,570 --> 04:14:46,130
believe in yourself no matter the ass believe believe it i
know you have what it it takes to figure it out.

4234
04:14:46,770 --> 04:14:50,650
The entire day, Tails and I have been asking yourselves,
what would Sonic do?

4235
04:14:51,570 --> 04:14:52,650
So what would you do?

4236
04:14:53,170 --> 04:14:54,370
What would I do?

4237
04:14:55,510 --> 04:14:58,530
Will I speed through head on and rescue my friends?

4238
04:14:58,930 --> 04:15:00,470
By any means necessary.

4239
04:15:01,230 --> 04:15:02,010
I knew it!

4240
04:15:02,090 --> 04:15:03,310
Spin Dash!

4241
04:15:04,110 --> 04:15:04,370
Woo!

4242
04:15:05,550 --> 04:15:06,210
Did I do it?

4243
04:15:06,630 --> 04:15:08,310
Oh, I have to fucking...

4244
04:15:08,310 --> 04:15:09,270
I knew it!

4245
04:15:09,690 --> 04:15:14,090
One big wind-up Sonic Spin Dash was fast enough to get that
door open.

4246
04:15:14,870 --> 04:15:16,410
Now that's the rose killer.

4247
04:15:16,690 --> 04:15:18,030
Nothing can stop us.

4248
04:15:18,570 --> 04:15:19,510
Better hold on to your pants.

4249
04:15:19,710 --> 04:15:21,850
I don't think we'll be getting another break after this.

4250
04:15:22,430 --> 04:15:22,990
Ready to go?

4251
04:15:24,010 --> 04:15:24,330
Yes.

4252
04:15:24,750 --> 04:15:25,470
Let's do it.

4253
04:15:25,650 --> 04:15:28,050
Got the fucking spin dash every fucking room?

4254
04:15:28,610 --> 04:15:29,530
To the conductor car.

4255
04:15:29,790 --> 04:15:31,290
The end of this mystery.

4256
04:15:32,370 --> 04:15:34,150
Does it go through every fucking room?

4257
04:15:34,610 --> 04:15:35,170
Let's see.

4258
04:15:36,450 --> 04:15:38,590
Because then I'd be... Oh, what the fuck?

4259
04:15:38,810 --> 04:15:39,850
Okay, real game.

4260
04:15:40,270 --> 04:15:43,710
Alright, our friends are locked in the cars up ahead.

4261
04:15:44,210 --> 04:15:48,490
In my last adventure, maxing out my ring count gave me an
extra boost of speed.

4262
04:15:48,850 --> 04:15:50,050
My grand grab enough rings.

4263
04:15:50,470 --> 04:15:52,950
I should be fast enough to burst through the next door too.

4264
04:15:53,270 --> 04:15:54,730
Oh my god, it's full screen time.

4265
04:15:55,730 --> 04:15:56,430
Let's do this.

4266
04:15:56,690 --> 04:15:57,730
The sprites are so cool.

4267
04:15:57,870 --> 04:15:58,930
I love the sprites for this.

4268
04:15:59,610 --> 04:16:00,010
Let's see.

4269
04:16:00,830 --> 04:16:01,130
Mew!

4270
04:16:02,850 --> 04:16:05,270
Okay guys, okay, this is not looking so good.

4271
04:16:06,110 --> 04:16:06,810
You know what?

4272
04:16:07,150 --> 04:16:09,030
Maybe we aren't gonna be saving our...

4273
04:16:09,030 --> 04:16:09,570
No!

4274
04:16:10,510 --> 04:16:11,650
Okay, there's no way.

4275
04:16:11,990 --> 04:16:14,070
They're gonna be like super generous with these.

4276
04:16:14,210 --> 04:16:15,530
Oh, I just...

4277
04:16:15,530 --> 04:16:17,830
Oh, shit.

4278
04:16:19,630 --> 04:16:22,110
Just wait till I see Eggman, y'all.

4279
04:16:22,590 --> 04:16:24,090
I'm gonna clobber him.

4280
04:16:25,390 --> 04:16:27,090
We gotta deal with the train first.

4281
04:16:27,190 --> 04:16:28,010
Come on, let's go.

4282
04:16:28,670 --> 04:16:28,790
Hmm.

4283
04:16:29,670 --> 04:16:30,730
Is Knuckles gonna join me?

4284
04:16:30,890 --> 04:16:32,450
Wait, Knuckles is not even gonna join me.

4285
04:16:32,530 --> 04:16:34,250
Guys, exact rings.

4286
04:16:34,850 --> 04:16:36,170
How does she do it?

4287
04:16:36,770 --> 04:16:39,670
I knew I just needed exact rings.

4288
04:16:40,470 --> 04:16:41,010
Oh, no.

4289
04:16:41,170 --> 04:16:44,190
It's like each level is like each of the mechanics they
introduce.

4290
04:16:44,210 --> 04:16:44,750
No!

4291
04:16:44,930 --> 04:16:48,770
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no, this is rough.

4292
04:16:48,850 --> 04:16:49,610
This is so rough.

4293
04:16:50,250 --> 04:16:51,990
No, I just got it, too.

4294
04:16:52,310 --> 04:16:52,850
Oh, my god.

4295
04:16:52,970 --> 04:16:54,170
Okay, I'm fucking doing it.

4296
04:16:54,450 --> 04:16:55,850
All right, I hope it doesn't make me restart.

4297
04:16:57,930 --> 04:16:59,510
You all came for us.

4298
04:17:00,490 --> 04:17:01,970
Of course, but let's move.

4299
04:17:03,130 --> 04:17:05,490
The train wants to take us prisoner and earn a reward.

4300
04:17:06,190 --> 04:17:09,110
My reward is to get off this stupid train.

4301
04:17:09,830 --> 04:17:10,470
Let's go.

4302
04:17:10,470 --> 04:17:11,450
Alright.

4303
04:17:11,990 --> 04:17:12,810
I'll get to 60.

4304
04:17:13,550 --> 04:17:15,330
Is this the one where it's like the missile?

4305
04:17:15,970 --> 04:17:17,450
Or is it still the spinny thing?

4306
04:17:18,970 --> 04:17:20,970
Oh, nothing is popping up.

4307
04:17:21,170 --> 04:17:21,990
I don't like that.

4308
04:17:22,810 --> 04:17:24,670
Why is nothing popping up?

4309
04:17:30,420 --> 04:17:31,020
Okay.

4310
04:17:31,620 --> 04:17:32,680
Okay, we got it.

4311
04:17:33,620 --> 04:17:34,880
We just got it.

4312
04:17:35,480 --> 04:17:36,460
I'm getting better.

4313
04:17:38,340 --> 04:17:38,900
Spin dash!

4314
04:17:40,860 --> 04:17:41,460
Sonic.

4315
04:17:42,240 --> 04:17:43,500
It's about time.

4316
04:17:43,920 --> 04:17:45,540
I thought you were supposed to be fast, Sonic.

4317
04:17:46,380 --> 04:17:48,420
Okay, why don't you save yourself, fucking bitch?

4318
04:17:48,580 --> 04:17:49,960
Okay, we got a movie too, ready?

4319
04:17:50,640 --> 04:17:51,040
Always.

4320
04:17:52,140 --> 04:17:52,940
Let's boogie!

4321
04:17:54,780 --> 04:17:55,180
Alright.

4322
04:17:56,320 --> 04:17:57,460
Oh, it's just a...

4323
04:17:57,460 --> 04:17:59,500
Okay, these one I'm not as scared.

4324
04:18:00,100 --> 04:18:02,860
Because, like, it's just, like, the missile, and I can dodge
those.

4325
04:18:03,240 --> 04:18:04,820
Like, I just need to...

4326
04:18:04,820 --> 04:18:06,700
I just need to...

4327
04:18:06,700 --> 04:18:08,020
She didn't even say thank you!

4328
04:18:08,460 --> 04:18:10,120
She was just like, where were you?

4329
04:18:12,220 --> 04:18:22,720
fucking rude man i literally saved her ass oh exactly but it
doesn't matter because i am an overachiever okay this one

4330
04:18:22,720 --> 04:18:36,840

conductor car say no more let's go all right last one this

4331
04:18:36,840 --> 04:18:43,260

4332
04:18:43,260 --> 04:18:44,260
Oh, it's 55!

4333
04:18:44,720 --> 04:18:46,540
They gave me less of a challenge!

4334
04:18:47,460 --> 04:18:47,920
Nice.

4335
04:18:48,860 --> 04:18:49,320
Okay.

4336
04:18:51,420 --> 04:18:51,880
55.

4337
04:18:52,200 --> 04:18:56,300
Okay, I was gonna be so scared that I, like, that was, like,
last.

4338
04:18:56,880 --> 04:18:57,600
That should be it.

4339
04:18:58,500 --> 04:18:59,140
Spin dash!

4340
04:18:59,760 --> 04:19:00,220
Sonic!

4341
04:19:01,120 --> 04:19:02,080
Sonic, you're here!

4342
04:19:03,680 --> 04:19:05,000
Is this a way to treat?

4343
04:19:05,040 --> 04:19:06,940
This is no way to treat that birthday, gal.

4344
04:19:07,680 --> 04:19:08,320
You're right.

4345
04:19:08,420 --> 04:19:09,900
I'm gonna stop this train.

4346
04:19:10,100 --> 04:19:11,400
I'm ready to stop this train.

4347
04:19:12,220 --> 04:19:13,460
to finish this.

4348
04:19:14,900 --> 04:19:14,900
Nice.

4349
04:19:15,340 --> 04:19:15,620
Is that it?

4350
04:19:16,760 --> 04:19:16,960
Did I?

4351
04:19:18,360 --> 04:19:19,440
Did I did it?

4352
04:19:19,840 --> 04:19:20,620
Did I do it?

4353
04:19:25,640 --> 04:19:28,220
Excellent work trapping these pests.

4354
04:19:28,800 --> 04:19:29,840
Now hurry to me.

4355
04:19:30,780 --> 04:19:33,940
I must properly dispose them to begin my plans.

4356
04:19:34,440 --> 04:19:35,180
For Igmat Latte!

4357
04:19:35,180 --> 04:19:36,860
Wait, he just wants to build an amusement park?

4358
04:19:37,000 --> 04:19:38,680
Like, what's so bad about that?

4359
04:19:39,140 --> 04:19:40,600
And probably another death?

4360
04:19:40,600 --> 04:19:41,960
Okay, maybe that's pretty bad.

4361
04:19:42,280 --> 04:19:42,880
Deathig!

4362
04:19:48,560 --> 04:19:53,260
Don't teleport us to the, uh, yeah, maybe not tell, yeah,
and don't teleport us to the future.

4363
04:19:54,060 --> 04:19:58,420
Teleport you all to the future when I've already ruled the
planet?

4364
04:19:59,100 --> 04:20:00,420
Sure, I'll do that.

4365
04:20:01,380 --> 04:20:01,380
Whatever.

4366
04:20:03,260 --> 04:20:04,260

We're almost at 65.

4389
04:21:17,550 --> 04:21:21,190
It's basically like that one where the fucking meteors were
dropping.

4390
04:21:21,910 --> 04:21:23,390
Except now there's their arms.

He's retiring.

4399
04:21:42,430 --> 04:21:43,770

Never leave me.

Forever.

4421
04:22:57,430 --> 04:22:58,410

4422
04:22:58,410 --> 04:23:00,770
The kind of friends.

4423
04:23:01,130 --> 04:23:03,150
Who would never leave each other.

4424
04:23:04,690 --> 04:23:06,690
Why would he betray me?

4425
04:23:09,490 --> 04:23:11,570
Bro, that's sad, bro.

4426
04:23:12,970 --> 04:23:13,630
Alright, here we go.

04:23:25,450 --> 04:23:26,830
We're not getting a lot of rings.

4433
04:23:27,010 --> 04:23:28,730
I hope I didn't miss a lot.

4434
04:23:30,430 --> 04:23:32,650
Oh, fuck, I looked at Chad!

4435
04:23:34,590 --> 04:23:35,070
Okay.

04:23:35,890 --> 04:23:36,490
This is it.

4437
04:23:36,830 --> 04:23:37,750
Oh, I just made it.

4438
04:23:37,770 --> 04:23:38,510
Oh, thank God.

4439
04:23:39,250 --> 04:23:39,730
Conductor!

4440
04:23:42,910 --> 04:23:44,270
You promised me.

4441
04:23:44,610 --> 04:23:45,670
You promised!

4442
04:23:46,850 --> 04:23:48,990
Let him speak unhand him.

4443
04:23:49,690 --> 04:23:50,070
Hey, guys.

4444
04:23:50,170 --> 04:23:52,130

4445
04:23:52,710 --> 04:23:53,750
Train, stop this.

4446
04:23:54,150 --> 04:23:55,630
I told you we'll be each other forever.

4447
04:23:56,150 --> 04:23:56,830
I was a...

4448
04:23:58,550 --> 04:24:00,750
I was a much younger man.

4449
04:24:01,990 --> 04:24:03,490
I'm getting old.

4450
04:24:04,690 --> 04:24:05,670
getting tired.

4451
04:24:06,010 --> 04:24:08,550
I can't keep up with you anymore.

4452
04:24:10,910 --> 04:24:11,610
Excuses.

4453
04:24:12,290 --> 04:24:14,270
How dare you abandon me?

4454
04:24:14,870 --> 04:24:15,950
I'll be lonely.

4455
04:24:16,610 --> 04:24:17,670
So lonely.

4456
04:24:18,970 --> 04:24:22,190
Why must you insist learning this upon me?

4457
04:24:24,950 --> 04:24:25,450

A flicky.

This is just like the lore card.

When my ex-best friend left detective work to join Dr.
Eggman.

The stakes are rising every second, huh?

4474
04:25:54,750 --> 04:25:55,790
A toky bird.

04:25:58,430 --> 04:25:59,030
Howdy.

4482
04:26:06,750 --> 04:26:07,970
Are you guys going to help out?

4483
04:26:10,490 --> 04:26:10,930
No?

4484
04:26:11,190 --> 04:26:11,450
All right.

4485
04:26:11,650 --> 04:26:12,250
Let's do this.

4486
04:26:13,150 --> 04:26:14,030
By myself.

4487
04:26:14,790 --> 04:26:15,570
Let's go.

04:26:25,710 --> 04:26:27,990

4490
04:26:29,590 --> 04:26:29,870
All right.

4491
04:26:29,930 --> 04:26:30,410
Let's see.

4492
04:26:30,610 --> 04:26:31,050
Oh, no.

4493
04:26:31,130 --> 04:26:31,410
Okay.

4494
04:26:31,450 --> 04:26:31,870
Thank God.

4495
04:26:32,330 --> 04:26:32,710
Oh.

04:26:32,810 --> 04:26:38,350
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

4497
04:26:38,410 --> 04:26:40,730
Oh, thank God, okay, I still have just enough rings.

4498
04:26:42,450 --> 04:26:43,650
Sonic's got this.

4499
04:26:44,030 --> 04:26:44,830
Is this three hit?

4500
04:26:45,650 --> 04:26:47,270
Like the usual Sonic games?

4501
04:26:48,970 --> 04:26:52,730
Just to be delivered to Eggman already?

4502
04:26:53,910 --> 04:26:56,970
What about my happiness?

4503
04:26:58,130 --> 04:27:00,230
Your happiness comes at expense of others.

4504
04:27:02,810 --> 04:27:04,650
That's called being selfish.

4505
04:27:05,150 --> 04:27:05,210
Whoa!

4506
04:27:09,150 --> 04:27:09,710
Me?

4507
04:27:10,350 --> 04:27:10,910
Selfish?

4508
04:27:11,650 --> 04:27:12,030
How?

4509
04:27:12,410 --> 04:27:14,070
How dare you?

4510
04:27:15,090 --> 04:27:16,150
Oh no, one more hit.

4511
04:27:17,170 --> 04:27:18,810
That's me three hits, just like Mario.

4512
04:27:20,350 --> 04:27:22,610
I can't believe I said that for a Sega game.

4513
04:27:24,850 --> 04:27:25,410
Okay.

4514
04:27:25,950 --> 04:27:26,490
Let's go.

4515
04:27:27,630 --> 04:27:30,810
Oh my god, there's so many things going on my screen.

4516
04:27:31,490 --> 04:27:31,770
Nice.

4517
04:27:32,810 --> 04:27:33,170
Okay.

4518
04:27:33,490 --> 04:27:34,350

What happened to SPO?

4530
04:28:45,510 --> 04:28:46,390
The one that knows...

4531
04:28:46,390 --> 04:28:49,270
That's the ninja detective that knows 17 languages.

4532
04:28:50,050 --> 04:28:52,570
Why isn't he helping me?

4533

04:31:46,860 --> 04:31:50,120
Well, I say, I've never been on a train like that before.

4581
04:31:51,140 --> 04:31:54,780
This universe has a unique way of doing things.

4582
04:31:56,320 --> 04:31:57,080
Watch your step.

4583
04:31:57,360 --> 04:31:58,420
Watch your step.

4584
04:32:00,480 --> 04:32:01,600
It's over.

4585
04:32:03,100 --> 04:32:07,720
The mystery of Sonic the Hedgehog's murder is officially
over.

4586
04:32:09,640 --> 04:32:10,740
Maybe next birthday.

04:32:14,640 --> 04:32:15,200
Ye-ha.

4589
04:32:17,820 --> 04:32:19,260
Oh, you don't love parties?

4590
04:32:19,480 --> 04:32:21,340
We're by the end, someone tries to kill you?

4591
04:32:23,440 --> 04:32:25,260
I think I'm going to miss this group.

4592
04:32:25,480 --> 04:32:26,700
Unhinge, way of thinking.

4593
04:32:29,200 --> 04:32:30,680
Oh, God, no wonder.

4594
04:32:30,820 --> 04:32:31,920
Yeah, train wife.

4595
04:32:33,900 --> 04:32:35,720
Honey, you're late.

4596
04:32:35,880 --> 04:32:37,420
I've been waiting here for out.

4597
04:32:37,500 --> 04:32:38,560
Oh, I'm sorry, train wife.

4598
04:32:39,120 --> 04:32:40,420
He made the right choice.

4599
04:32:46,370 --> 04:32:46,810
Yeah.

4600
04:32:47,310 --> 04:32:48,730
Sorry, bro.

4601
04:32:57,860 --> 04:33:00,440
You'll honestly never believe what happened.

4602
04:33:00,760 --> 04:33:01,140
Bro, what the?

4603
04:33:01,200 --> 04:33:02,360
That's so fucked up.

4604
04:33:02,540 --> 04:33:04,840
He's like, just, it's just like a story to him.

4605
04:33:07,600 --> 04:33:08,640
It's just...

4606
04:33:08,640 --> 04:33:14,700
Like, by the way, like, trade wife was like, now my trade
husband.

4607
04:33:15,360 --> 04:33:17,200
And then he's like, oh, honey.

04:33:18,100 --> 04:33:19,040
Let me tell you.

4609
04:33:19,060 --> 04:33:23,300
about this crazy story I had with a fucking train.

4610
04:33:27,720 --> 04:33:33,580
It was everything for train wife, but the train was just an
afterthought.

4611
04:33:37,100 --> 04:33:39,080
So I won't even try.

4612
04:33:39,280 --> 04:33:41,260
Paha, paha, paha.

4613
04:33:43,700 --> 04:33:45,980
I'm just glad you're here.

4614
04:33:46,160 --> 04:33:48,620
Quick, we'll leave for Spagonia in the morning.

04:33:49,060 --> 04:33:50,260

4616
04:33:51,760 --> 04:33:53,140
Oh, pack faster than the wind.

4618
04:33:54,860 --> 04:33:56,200

04:34:03,080 --> 04:34:03,380
Something.

4625
04:34:03,600 --> 04:34:05,320
Wait, does this, like, make sense?

4626

4630
04:34:15,380 --> 04:34:16,080
It's ink.

4631
04:34:16,160 --> 04:34:17,260

4632
04:34:17,740 --> 04:34:19,000

04:35:49,440 --> 04:35:50,000
We're cool.

4652
04:35:50,320 --> 04:35:52,380
And now that we're all safe, it was fun.

4653
04:35:53,780 --> 04:35:56,080
This group has a wild idea of fun.

4654
04:35:57,660 --> 04:35:59,460
Boy, I am starving.

4655
04:36:00,260 --> 04:36:02,320
I forgot we never ate.

4656
04:36:03,360 --> 04:36:08,120
With, hey y'all, with all that clatter, I completely forgot
I was hungry.

4657
04:36:09,100 --> 04:36:09,560
Me too.

4658
04:36:09,740 --> 04:36:11,480
I was distracted playing detective.

4659
04:36:12,100 --> 04:36:12,920
They even eat?

4660
04:36:13,120 --> 04:36:14,620
They never even eaten at all.

4661
04:36:15,420 --> 04:36:21,980
If only you have seen me, Sonic, I was finding clues,
presenting evidence, poking holes, and alibis.

4662
04:36:22,600 --> 04:36:24,380
Sonic, wait, where did he go?

4663
04:36:24,580 --> 04:36:25,660
Oh, is it chili dog time?

4664
04:36:26,060 --> 04:36:26,920
Everyone, guess what?

4665
04:36:27,080 --> 04:36:27,900
Chili dogs!

4666
04:36:28,320 --> 04:36:28,500
What?

4667
04:36:29,940 --> 04:36:30,540
What?

4668
04:36:30,840 --> 04:36:31,920
I was lied to.

4669
04:36:33,060 --> 04:36:35,080
Where the fuck is my chili dogs?

4670
04:36:36,220 --> 04:36:38,120
This station has a bakery.

4671
04:36:38,740 --> 04:36:40,300
And look what I bought.

4672
04:36:40,980 --> 04:36:42,080
A bird...

4673
04:36:42,080 --> 04:36:42,980
Wait, what?

4674
04:36:43,820 --> 04:36:45,280
That was so fast.

4675
04:36:45,420 --> 04:36:54,780
how did they somehow have amy's face on a cake at a nearby
bakery a birthday cake

A ride.

4680
04:37:28,600 --> 04:37:30,540
A ride from start to finish.

4681
04:37:31,520 --> 04:37:32,760
Just like my dark soul.

4682
04:37:33,500 --> 04:37:36,660
May our friendship grow stronger each celebration.

4683
04:37:38,980 --> 04:37:40,460
I admire your tenacity.

4684
04:37:41,020 --> 04:37:42,940
May you never lose your vivacity.

4685
04:37:43,340 --> 04:37:44,000
I don't know.

4686
04:37:44,740 --> 04:37:46,120
Happy birthday to Amy.

4687
04:37:46,580 --> 04:37:48,560
And her sparkling personality.

4688
04:37:52,380 --> 04:37:53,500
Happy birthday!

4689
04:37:54,280 --> 04:37:57,340
I'm not smart to know if personacity is a word.

4690
04:37:57,680 --> 04:37:58,000
Me too.

4691
04:37:59,120 --> 04:37:59,940
Because I'm you.

4692
04:38:00,580 --> 04:38:01,840
We love you, Amy!

4693
04:38:02,160 --> 04:38:03,360
Happy birthday!

4694
04:38:05,020 --> 04:38:05,420
Ah!

4695
04:38:05,900 --> 04:38:06,260
Ah!

4696
04:38:06,860 --> 04:38:07,880
You guys!

4697
04:38:08,240 --> 04:38:10,600
We almost got murdered by a lonely train!

4698
04:38:11,000 --> 04:38:11,860
But, but!

4699
04:38:12,000 --> 04:38:14,280
I like how to do this all in front of the train corpse.

4700
04:38:14,440 --> 04:38:16,580
Like, that's, like, the most fucked up thing for me.

4701
04:38:16,900 --> 04:38:19,940
Like, there's a fucking corpse of a train.

4702
04:38:19,960 --> 04:38:28,640
there and they're just like yay I wouldn't trade these
adventures for anything never in a minute like did they not

4703
04:38:28,640 --> 04:38:38,660
feel anything like that train was like fucking depressed but
like Sonic says just stop being sad never in a million years

4704
04:38:39,980 --> 04:38:54,240
you guys won't ever leave me right wouldn't dream of it now
let's have some cake yes please dig in everyone yeah i hope

4705
04:38:54,240 --> 04:38:56,640

4708
04:39:39,620 --> 04:39:53,760

when i met sonic and his friends entangled in their lives

4709
04:39:53,760 --> 04:39:57,560
for a moment and then back to things as they were.

4710
04:39:59,540 --> 04:40:04,580
Cities realized Eggman was running the train station and
fought back to seize control.

4711
04:40:05,260 --> 04:40:07,340
Everything's squeaky clean now.

4712
04:40:07,980 --> 04:40:11,240
As for me, I quit my job.

4713
04:40:11,400 --> 04:40:11,900
Wait, no.

4714
04:40:12,380 --> 04:40:16,540
Okay, if I stuck with a gig, that means train wife is mine.

4715
04:40:20,600 --> 04:40:24,100
Do I keep my minimum wage train job for train wife?

4716
04:40:24,220 --> 04:40:28,000
Or, like, or quit, guys.

4717
04:40:28,940 --> 04:40:29,720
Stick with it?

4718
04:40:30,060 --> 04:40:31,140
I could have train wife.

4719
04:40:31,260 --> 04:40:32,980
I can have my own train wife.

4720
04:40:33,480 --> 04:40:34,820
Okay, and then.

4721
04:40:36,220 --> 04:40:37,820
One millionth in the lottery.

4722
04:40:38,200 --> 04:40:39,080
Okay, one millionth.

4723
04:40:39,220 --> 04:40:42,680
And after all that, I managed to fly.

4724
04:40:42,720 --> 04:40:44,760
Why would I already did that on stream?

4725
04:40:45,880 --> 04:40:47,660
Manage to fly to space.

4726
04:40:48,280 --> 04:40:51,280
Yeah, that's just been my life.

4727
04:40:54,240 --> 04:40:56,260
Guys, I got my own train wife.

4728
04:40:56,400 --> 04:40:57,580
Now I'm affluening to me.

4729
04:40:57,720 --> 04:40:58,540
Oh my god.

4730
04:41:00,160 --> 04:41:00,760
Holy fuck.

4731
04:41:01,800 --> 04:41:02,960
That was five hours.

4732
04:41:03,200 --> 04:41:03,980
Oh my god.

4733
04:41:09,460 --> 04:41:13,020
It's not even April Fool's for East Coast anymore.

4734
04:41:16,100 --> 04:41:19,420
And then everybody stood up and clapped.

4735
04:41:22,420 --> 04:41:23,760
We did it!

4736
04:41:24,880 --> 04:41:25,360
Yeah!

4737
04:41:26,360 --> 04:41:27,280
That was fun though.

4738
04:41:27,500 --> 04:41:32,420
I'm really happy to actually finally try out this game from
start to finish.

4739
04:41:32,580 --> 04:41:37,080
I've always wondered what this game, I mean obviously it was
about the murder of Sonic the Hedgehog, but like I was

4740
04:41:37,080 --> 04:41:39,640
always wondered like what was this April Fool's game.

4741
04:41:39,740 --> 04:41:40,660
That was really fun.

4742
04:41:41,420 --> 04:41:43,280
I really had a lot of fun though.

4743
04:41:44,660 --> 04:41:48,540

I'm just saying, I understand why the conductor chose land
wife over train wife.

4761
04:43:36,920 --> 04:43:38,300
I understand now.

4762
04:43:40,440 --> 04:43:41,980
That's so fucked up.

4763
04:43:42,220 --> 04:43:51,660
The train wife was like putting their entire soul into like
how much they love conductor as a friend.

4764
04:43:52,380 --> 04:43:53,820
As a really good roommates, you know?

4765
04:43:54,220 --> 04:43:57,500
And then the conductor was like, Oh my god, real wife.

4766
04:43:57,680 --> 04:43:58,520
Let me tell you about this.

4767
04:43:59,260 --> 04:44:00,200
Oh my god, real wife.

04:44:00,300 --> 04:44:01,740

Poor fucking train.

4775
04:44:22,640 --> 04:44:36,540
So someone was like, I'd make the same choice it was so fun

04:45:06,140 --> 04:45:09,100
I don't, I, I, honestly, I'm like, I got one guide.

4781
04:45:09,280 --> 04:45:10,680
There was no fucking, I got one guide.

4782
04:45:10,760 --> 04:45:11,880
There was no extra credit scene.

4783
04:45:12,000 --> 04:45:12,940
I can't believe it.

4784
04:45:13,000 --> 04:45:18,020
Like, I got fucking one guide as always.

4785
04:45:18,280 --> 04:45:19,400
God damn it.

4786
04:45:21,320 --> 04:45:24,960

04:45:26,840 --> 04:45:34,800
Sadly, for those who didn't read Twitter, I will be
canceling tomorrow's stream because I will be like, I want

I've been going way too fast in my career.

4791
04:45:45,060 --> 04:45:53,240
So tomorrow, I will be like working on stabilizing myself
and making sure to like look through everything to make sure

4792
04:45:53,240 --> 04:45:55,540
that like restructuring how things are done.

4793
04:45:58,020 --> 04:46:06,480
behind the scenes so like we don't like miss out on things
so that's why tomorrow there will not be a stream tomorrow

4794
04:46:07,480 --> 04:46:13,040
I'll pin that on the schedule waiting room so like if people
were like where's the stream and then they look at the
