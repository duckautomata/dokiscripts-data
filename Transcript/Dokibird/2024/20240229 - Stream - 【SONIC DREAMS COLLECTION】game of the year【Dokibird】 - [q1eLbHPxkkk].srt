00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,800
Hello everybody!

2
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:02,580
Hello!

3
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:08,120
I hope the music is not too loud because oh my god it is very loud on my end.

4
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:11,300
Hello everybody!

5
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,640
I cannot believe it.

6
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:20,300
We're finally going to play the best Sonic game ever created.

7
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:23,440
Which I've yet to ever... which I've never played before.

8
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:31,980
That's when you know that it is a really good game.

9
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:37,920
Because even I know this is the best Sonic game ever.

10
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:40,240
But... okay it's a little loud.

11
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,460
Let me turn that down.

12
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,220
Shit down.

13
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,320
Don't worry it was very loud for me too.

14
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:48,360
Look this game was made in like the 90s okay?

15
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:52,500
Like there was no like sound balancing or like mixing.

16
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,420
Mix... like...

17
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:58,640
Sound mixing and balancing in game was not a thing back in the 90s guys.

18
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:03,400
Just remember see it was made in 96, 97, 98 and 99.

19
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,580
So game... game audio balancing was not a thing back then.

20
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:13,440
The 90s were a different time guys.

21
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,480
Uh Mehdi thank you for the super chat.

22
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:16,400
Thank you, thank you.

23
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:18,680
It's like a car crash I don't... what do you mean?

24
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,440
This... this in my opinion is...

25
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:25,900
No... I feel like in my opinion...

26
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:33,480
Sonic Dreams collection is one of the best Sonic game collection they have ever made.

27
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,520
Each one.

28
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:41,200
Make My Sonic, Eggman Origin, Sonic Movie Maker and my roommate Sonic.

29
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:45,300
I would say like all of them 10 out of 10.

30
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:47,060
Never played either any of them before.

31
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,340
But like just reading the names...

32
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:51,820
I can tell...

33
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:55,040
That it is a 10 out of 10 game.

34
00:04:55,340 --> 00:05:01,560
So for those who are wondering like what is the lore behind Sonic Dreams collection?

35
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:03,000
Well...

36
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:05,720
Obviously none of us...

37
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,120
Uh...

38
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:06,960
Uh...

39
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:11,240
Obviously like not a lot of us grew up with Sonic Dreams collection.

40
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:13,480
But I've heard that like...

41
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,680
These games were...

42
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,440
Um...

43
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:20,640
Were released only back then for like one year.

44
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,600
Like when it was released.

45
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:23,280
It was only out for a limited time.

46
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:27,160
So like not a lot of people were able to actually play these games back then.

47
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,180
In 96, 97, 98, 99.

48
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,360
So...

49
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:30,860
Uh...

50
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:32,960
They recently re-released it.

51
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:34,660
Like 10 years ago.

52
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:44,200
It was recently re-released 10 years ago.

53
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:45,300
So...

54
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:50,580
So those who didn't grow up back then...

55
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:51,320
Um...

56
00:05:51,320 --> 00:06:00,420
To be able to play these games missed out on what was considered peak Sonic gaming.

57
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:01,580
Uh...

58
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,400
So...

59
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,260
It's been 10 years.

60
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:15,360
Yes, it has been almost 10 years since the collection came out.

61
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,380
Um...

62
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:17,840
Also, by the way...

63
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:18,560
So like...

64
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,120
Wait, who?

65
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:19,520
Sega.

66
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,360
So I was gonna be like, who made Sonic?

67
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,100
Haha...

68
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:22,840
Sega!

69
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:23,860
Uh...

70
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:25,160
Contracted...

71
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,020
Um...

72
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:27,060
These developers.

73
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:36,100
Because back then, Sega was like, we should hire American developers to make a Sonic game.

74
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,180
So...

75
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:37,640
Uh...

76
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,520
They contacted these developers.

77
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:45,960
And after making what was known as one of the best Sonic collection games ever...

78
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,500
They went on to make...

79
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,020
Uh...

80
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:49,840
Tattletail.

81
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:50,940
And...

82
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:52,160
Neon White.

83
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,440
Isn't that crazy?

84
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:54,540
I can't believe...

85
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:55,300
No wonder...

86
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:57,520
No wonder Neon White was so good.

87
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,780
They came from Sonic Dream Collection.

88
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,760
They can never miss.

89
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:06,780
They...

90
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:08,040
They don't miss!

91
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:12,940
They knew what the consumer wants back in the 90s.

92
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:17,420
And now they know what the consumer wants in the 2023.

93
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:23,460
So true!

94
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:25,080
They don't miss!

95
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:26,060
Uh...

96
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:27,920
Court Jester, thank you for the super chat.

97
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:28,280
Thank you.

98
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:28,860
Thank you.

99
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,420
I've never heard of the best Sonic game there is.

100
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:33,200
Can't wait to experience it through you.

101
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:33,740
Thank you!

102
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:34,700
Thank you for the super chat.

103
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:34,960
Thank you.

104
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:35,280
Thank you.

105
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:36,900
I've never played this game before.

106
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,120
But like...

107
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:42,140
Through word of mouth from the people who played it in the 90s.

108
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:42,640
I...

109
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,780
I heard it was really good.

110
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,240
Hahaha...

111
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:47,400
I'm so happy.

112
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,560
I've been...

113
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,880
I've been wanting to play this game for a very long time.

114
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:55,320
But it was just so perfect.

115
00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:00,280
That was very hard to be able to like play at its current time.

116
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,360
Because like...

117
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,840
You know, they wanted to...

118
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:03,760
They released...

119
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,360
They re-released it 10 years ago.

120
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,540
And like...

121
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:07,400
They wanna keep...

122
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:14,820
They wanna keep the peak gaming experience 10 years ago untouched.

123
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:17,380
Because you had to be there in the moment when it was released.

124
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:22,220
So it was very hard to play it now.

125
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,500
But now...

126
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,500
Now I can!

127
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:26,560
Now I can!

128
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:32,880
Now we get to finally experience this game with all of you.

129
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:33,920
Hahaha...

130
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:36,220
Sonic 06 is better.

131
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,040
Lies!

132
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:44,880
Sonic 06 wishes it was just as good as my roommate Sonic.

133
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:47,360
They wish they were just as good.

134
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:49,980
As my roommate Sonic.

135
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:51,840
My roommate Sonic.

136
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,840
Which I have not played before.

137
00:08:54,180 --> 00:09:02,820
But I believe that my roommate Sonic has the best beginning, middle and end.

138
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,800
It's rich with story.

139
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:11,160
And Sonic 06 wishes it has 2% of my roommate Sonic.

140
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,340
It wishes it has the...

141
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:13,940
The...

142
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:14,340
The...

143
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:15,120
Like...

144
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,360
It wishes it can be as good as roommate Sonic.

145
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,140
Oh my god.

146
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,120
Facts.

147
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:22,180
Hahaha...

148
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:23,760
Never played it before.

149
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,620
But I know it's just as good.

150
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:28,940
Hahaha...

151
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:32,500
True and real.

152
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:34,260
Hahaha...

153
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:36,240
Is my sound guy alive?

154
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:39,520
I don't even know if my sound guy is alive.

155
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:40,540
Sound guy!

156
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:42,140
How's...

157
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:45,100
You know it's good when the roommate Sonic is alive.

158
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:48,760
The resolution is 1280x960.

159
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:50,300
Hahaha...

160
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:54,100
Hahaha...

161
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:54,220
Hahaha...

162
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,360
That's when you know.

163
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:00,820
When the resolution is pure retro.

164
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:03,700
That's when you know it's a good game.

165
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:04,680
It is.

166
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:05,480
Sound guy!

167
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:06,440
How's the sound?

168
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,100
Is the music good enough?

169
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,240
Sound guy?

170
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:10,980
Uh...

171
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:11,760
Look, look!

172
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:11,940

173
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,760

174
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:14,840

Thank you!

178
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,680
As a true Sonic fan, this collection was a life changing experience.

179
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:24,040
Really makes you feel like Sonic.

180
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:24,380
See?

181
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:25,740

182
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:28,280

Thank you!

189
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:34,740
Look at that!

190
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,200
I have endorsements!

191
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,240
I have like witnesses!

192
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,620
Wait, what's that word?

193
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:41,260
Um...

194
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:43,660
What's that word when someone is vouching?

195
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:43,840
Vouchers!

196
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:46,920
I have vouchers from real Sonic fan!

197
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,980
Anyway, it's time to Make My Sonic.

198
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:53,060
Make My Sonic was MJ Studio's first prototype with Sega.

199
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:55,900
A Sonic OC original character creator.

200
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:59,760
MJ Studio was committed to fan self-expression.

201
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,900
They believed that Sonic was versatile enough for every genre.

202
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:05,600
Even sci-fi.

203
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:13,460
Originally, Make My Sonic was meant to create and upload avatars for use with every Dreamcast through SegaNet.

204
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:17,180
Sadly, no future games supported this level of creativity.

205
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,860
Oh my gosh.

206
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:21,280
Honestly, I feel like Sonic peaked it.

207
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:23,580
Like, Sonic peaked in Make My Sonic.

208
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,940
They tried to do that with the...

209
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:25,300
What was it?

210
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:26,200
The A-Force?

211
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:27,040
Sonic...

212
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:27,640
I forgot.

213
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,940
Remember that Sonic game they made?

214
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:33,300
Where you create your OC in Sonic?

215
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,300
But then it was like...

216
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:37,420
It was so bad.

217
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,240
Was it Sonic Forces?

218
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,040
Yeah, Sonic Forces.

219
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:44,180
You know?

220
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:45,140
They knew.

221
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,960
They knew they could never make...

222
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,100
Make My Sonic.

223
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:50,340
They tried to repeat perfection.

224
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:51,860
But they couldn't.

225
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:54,480
They couldn't, like, recreate perfection.

226
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,300
Darkblade, thank you for the magenta soup.

227
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:57,940
Thank you.

228
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:02,720
Doki, when I was hoping you played more Sonic games, I really didn't mean this.

229
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:03,640
What do you mean?

230
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:04,220
Of course.

231
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:04,920
What do you mean?

232
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,100
I would start off with the best Sonic game they've ever made.

233
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,940
Why would you say that, Darkblade?

234
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:13,100
Are you trying to say, Make My Sonic 96 where we can make our very own Sonic?

235
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:16,500
Sonic's original character is not peak gaming?

236
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:17,820
How could you say that?

237
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,420
We all want to have a Sonic OC.

238
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:22,580
Alright, Make My Sonic.

239
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:23,020
Let's go.

240
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:24,780
Okay.

241
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:25,360
Alright.

242
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:26,400
What do we want?

243
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:27,440
Alright.

244
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,100
We want a small head.

245
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,240
Ooh.

246
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:31,180
Ooh.

247
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:33,800
Turtle the King.

248
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:35,360
Alright.

249
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:38,500
How about...

250
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,040
Okay.

251
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,780
Small head for small hitbox.

252
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:41,260
You know?

253
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,160
I'm trying to...

254
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,080
No headshot.

255
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:43,580
You know?

256
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:45,640
No headshot.

257
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:46,100
Is there yellow?

258
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:46,980
Yellow Sonic?

259
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:48,020
Alright.

260
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:48,700
Yellow Sonic.

261
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:49,160
Where?

262
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:50,180
I want to be Yellow Sonic.

263
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:51,360
Alright.

264
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,820
Yellow Sonic.

265
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:53,480
Okay.

266
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,320
Background color.

267
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:56,400
You know what?

268
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,300
All yellow.

269
00:12:58,860 --> 00:12:59,800
That would be good.

270
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:00,520
All...

271
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,460
Oh, they don't even have yellow?

272
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:04,100
How can they have yellow Sonic but no yellow?

273
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,480
Also, is that why your colors match?

274
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:07,320
Exactly!

275
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,300
Yoko, thank you for the super chat.

276
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:09,700
Thank you.

277
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10,320
Thank you.

278
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,600
Exactly, Yoko.

279
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:13,060
You're welcome.

280
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:15,080
Oh, now you're thinking Sonic right now.

281
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:17,080
Now you're thinking Sonic.

282
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:21,520
Oh, there's a yellow background!

283
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:22,560
Alright.

284
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:23,100
Oh, wait.

285
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:23,820
I can move this.

286
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:24,740
Wait.

287
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:26,220
I can pose for...

288
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,160
I can pose.

289
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,120
Can I like...

290
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:30,840
Is this all...

291
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:30,980
Okay.

292
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:31,680
I can just move this.

293
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:32,460
Okay.

294
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:33,820
Alright.

295
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:34,880
I want to...

296
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:35,780
Alright.

297
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:36,560
You know what?

298
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,640
You're levitating, Sonic.

299
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:41,340
You know you can figure out your Sonic OC?

300
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:42,680
Uh...

301
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:47,940
By like putting your name in Google and then writing like Doki the Hedgehog.

302
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,440
And then you can have your own very own Sonic OC.

303
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,400
Apparently every name has a Sonic OC at this point.

304
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:55,020
Alright.

305
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,600
What do I...

306
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:56,860
Okay.

307
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:57,740
Okay.

308
00:13:57,780 --> 00:13:58,680
He's gonna be running.

309
00:13:58,760 --> 00:13:59,360
He's a runner.

310
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:00,280
Alright.

311
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:01,800
What is...

312
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:02,700
What is our...

313
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:02,880
Oh.

314
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:03,300
Okay.

315
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:03,680
Cheap.

316
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:03,900
Okay.

317
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:04,460
I can't type.

318
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:05,000
Sorry.

319
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:08,420
Back in the 90s, it was very hard to code in...

320
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:13,040
It was very hard to code in like the ability to...

321
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:13,900
To type your name.

322
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,300
So unfortunately, there were...

323
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:19,100
They had to make like custom names for everybody.

324
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:25,360
But there were so many custom names that you can pick from that like everybody had like their own name.

325
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:25,800
Yeah.

326
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:27,300
Look.

327
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,900
Back in 96...

328
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:31,340
Back in 96, it was...

329
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:32,700
It was very hard.

330
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:34,760
There was only like five megabytes.

331
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:35,200
Okay?

332
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:36,300
Like each...

333
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:37,800
Each like CD for...

334
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:39,440
Oh God.

335
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,160
Sonic.

336
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:42,080
Thank you for the Super Chat.

337
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:42,720
Many thanks.

338
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,440
Thank you.

339
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:43,540
Thank you.

340
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:50,520
Each CD for like computer gaming can only house five megabytes, guys.

341
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:54,060
So like of course, there was like no option to...

342
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,280
Yeah.

343
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,160
If you're lucky.

344
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,840
If you're lucky.

345
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:00,340
Five megabytes.

346
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:12,560
So back then, it's hard to code in the ability to type your name.

347
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:12,700
I'm sorry.

348
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,640
I can't type my name in...

349
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,320
In gaming.

350
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:20,560
Yeah, five whole megabytes.

351
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:21,620
Actually, I don't want this color.

352
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,560
Let's do like...

353
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:23,840
Let's do like...

354
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,240
You know what?

355
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:26,180
I would like it to be...

356
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:28,700
Dark like my heart.

357
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:31,100
Chibi Cassidy, the Immortal Headshark.

358
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:36,460
Solar Prego Meto Zen she the King Supreme Vocaloid Hedgehog.

359
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:37,540
Yes.

360
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:38,360
Vocaloid...

361
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:38,520
Wait.

362
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:38,960
What did you...

363
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:39,560
Hey.

364
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:48,120
As we all know, Vocaloid came out in 1996.

365
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:57,180
So like, they wanted to like capitalize on the Sonic fandom because Sonic was very popular back then.

366
00:15:57,340 --> 00:16:03,120
So the first prototype of Vocaloid was in Make My Sonic.

367
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:12,460
I don't know if you knew that guys.

368
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:13,520
A little fun fact!

369
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:14,660
A little fun fact.

370
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:18,320
Like before Hatsune Miku, it was...

371
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,580
It was...

372
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:25,640
Before... before Hatsune Miku, it was...

373
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:30,700
Sou Dino Kusumita, the rebel Vocaloid hedge girl.

374
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,100
But they realized that it was...

375
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:34,340
It was too long.

376
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:43,080
So they were like, why don't we combine all these letters in that name and make it Hatsune Miku.

377
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:46,940
And that's how we got our first Vocaloid.

378
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:53,680
Is that crazy?

379
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,520
Oh my god, that's crazy.

380
00:16:56,680 --> 00:17:01,320
I can't believe we're learning so much today about Sonic history.

00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:03,000

00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,900

Cynia the Supreme Hedge...

401
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:50,740
Okay, you know what?

402

00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,260
This is my Sonic OC.

404
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:54,740
Sexy...

Just so you guys know, this is sexy.

406
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:00,600
This is like peak sexiness right there.

407
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:01,440
Okay?

408
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:06,600
This is why my stream is at least PG-13.

409
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,820
It's just way too hot to handle.

410
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:10,120
Anyway...

411
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:12,640
I've...

412
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:16,620
The ideal peak hedgehog right here.

413
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:18,160
Alright, photo booth time.

414
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,040
Okay, ring.

415
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:22,080
Oh, okay, I can throw rings at myself.

416
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:22,940
Ooh!

417
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,400
Okay, next cam.

418
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:25,440
Oh?

419
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:26,720
Alright, next cam.

420
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:27,140
Oh!

421
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:28,460
Nice.

422
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:29,400
Yes.

423
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,180
Hahaha!

424
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,460
That's where all the sexiness lies.

425
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:36,240
I'm really scared about taking screenshots, so I'm gonna hide my screen.

426
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:39,900
Oh, okay.

427
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:40,920
Alright, good.

428
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:42,060
Okay, I had to...

429
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:44,220
I had to make sure...

430
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:47,540
That it doesn't do anything weird.

431
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:49,080
Alright, let's take a picture.

432
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,000
Oh!

433
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:51,460
That's great.

434
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,520
I'm gonna tweet this out, guys.

435
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:53,040
Give me a sec.

436
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,900
Let me tweet this out real fast.

437
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:55,840
Tweet photo.

438
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:58,680
I made my own Sonic OC.

439
00:18:58,940 --> 00:18:59,860
Check it out.

440
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:01,080
Thanks, Arcane Kids.

441
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,200
I had to connect my account.

442
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:04,360
You know what?

443
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:04,940
I'll do it.

444
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:06,400
No!

445
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,100
I forgot it's 96!

446
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:10,220
Sorry.

447
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:11,440
Back then...

448
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,880
I just need you guys to know.

449
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:16,040
Back then, there was a Twitter beta.

450
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:20,540
So, like, only people who have Sonic Dreams collection...

451
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:26,880
Only people who access Make My Sonic had the access to, like, Twitter beta.

452
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:28,000
So, like...

453
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:28,920
Hahaha!

454
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:29,840
I'm so sorry.

455
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:35,060
They first tested out Twitter on Make My Sonic.

456
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:43,680
Because they wanted to see what it was like to connect your game to, like, Twitter.

457
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,500
So, it was like the first Twitter connection.

458
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:46,540
I know.

459
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:47,980
Not only...

460
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:51,120
They just don't make Twitter like they do in 96.

461
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:55,920
Like, I know Wikipedia said Twitter came out after 96.

462
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:59,820
Back in 96, it was called Twitter.

463
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:03,400
I know like all these like youngins are like, what's Twitter?

464
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:04,860
Are you talking about X?

465
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:32,840
Back in 96 X was actually called Twitter And they had an exclusive deal with MakeMySonic to test out some features Where you can connect your account to Twitter.com And so so it was like the first uploading Twitter photos and it's true It's true.

466
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:35,180
You can look it up in the Sonic Wikipedia.

467
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:36,800
It's so true.

468
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,260
And it was uploaded to Sega net.

469
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:42,820
Well, no What do you mean?

470
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,280
No adapter detected.

471
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:48,500
How else would anyone know about sexy outfit?

472
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:52,460
See you the supreme hedgie How would they know?

473
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:05,580
How would all the other Sonic fanatics know about my beautiful creation?

474
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:08,600

475
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,540

Thank you.

Thank you.

483
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:28,980
I will not be silenced!

484
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:30,380
I'm gonna screenshot this.

485
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:35,100

486
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,320

00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:37,060

All right, the world must know.

492
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:06,460
I can't believe it!

493
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:07,960
I'm so sad!

494
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,300
I'm so sad.

495
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:11,760
Where's printable mode?

496
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:12,900
Where's printable mode?

497
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:13,020
Where's printable mode?

498
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:13,520

Guys...

504
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:27,660
It's like a coloring book!

505
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:30,880
It's literally a free coloring book.

506
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,100
Oh my god.

507
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:37,400
Things were so fucking better in 96 Where is my printable mode in PAL World?

508
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:39,780
Where is my printable mode in?

509
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:41,860
Sonic Forces!

510
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,080
In Sonic Boom!

511
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:44,980
I can't believe it!

512
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:52,720

00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:53,600

514
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:54,660
Where was my...

515
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:54,780
Where is it?

516
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:57,380
How was I supposed to color Sonic the Hedgehog?

517
00:22:57,820 --> 00:22:58,540
Huh?

518
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,680
She's got a point.

519
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,780
I can't believe we never had that.

520
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:08,240
Oh my god.

521
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,320
Anyway...

522
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:10,240
Um...

523
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:29,040
Uh... I hope you guys enjoy the first game of Sonic... of Sonic Dream Collection I hope you guys enjoy the first game of Sonic Dream Collection Sonic Dream Collection Sonic Dream Collection You know it's official when Sonic says that.

524
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,540
You know it's official.

525
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,380
I can't believe it.

526
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:34,160
I'm so sad.

527
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:35,760
My OC!

528
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:39,400
My OC's not on SegaNet!

529
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:45,060
All the other Sonic OC fans can't comment on my beautiful OC now!

530
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:46,960
I'm so... I'm so sad.

531
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:51,360
This is truly the gold era of gaming.

532
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:53,840
It can't possibly get better, can it?

533
00:23:53,840 --> 00:24:01,200
Well, the great thing about these American developers is that every year they've outdone themselves.

534
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:02,960
It's actually crazy.

535
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:09,620
If you guys thought Make My Sonic was that great, you should check out Eggman Origin.

536
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:13,640
Never played it, but I assume every game gets better from what I've heard.

537
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:18,560
Almost nothing is known about Eggman Origin.

538
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:21,180
There's no surviving documentation.

539
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,600
From digging through the code...

540
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,680
We can tell it was an MMORPG.

541
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:30,220
But few have ever seen past the title screen.

542
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:31,360
Oh my god!

543
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,720
We're gonna be one of the few!

544
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:43,820
Guys, it is such an honor to play Eggman Origins for all of you.

545
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:47,540
The first Sonic MMORPG.

546
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:49,920
Eggman Origins.

547
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:51,360
Wait, what?

548
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:53,580
No network at all?

549
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,100
Network adapter connected?

550
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:55,540
How do I get this?

551
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:01,860
Wait, guys.

552
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:04,980
How do we turn on...

553
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:07,240
Wait, I didn't install the network adapter?

554
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:10,720
Guys, how do I install the network adapter?

555
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:12,760
It's so ancient!

556
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:14,040
This...

557
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:20,900
This game is so ancient!

558
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:23,340
How do I get the network adapter?

559
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:25,220
Wait...

560
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:25,900
Okay, guys.

561
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:29,100
I gotta hook it up to the top.

562
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:30,020
Yeah...

563
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,440
We gotta go back to 96.

564
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,420
We gotta go back to 96?

565
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:38,520
Oh my god!

566
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,580
Okay, we gotta find the network adapter.

567
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,280
Okay, maybe it's in make... added Twitter support.

568
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:45,940
Okay.

569
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:49,240
I have to download it?

570
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:50,480
Oh my...

571
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,320
Okay, wait guys.

572
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,380
I need to find...

573
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:53,360
Don't worry.

574
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:53,860
Don't worry.

575
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:54,340
Don't worry.

576
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:57,360
I've downloaded everything there is to...

577
00:25:58,260 --> 00:25:59,840
When I bought Sonic Dreams Collection.

578
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:08,720
By the way, it was so difficult to like buy this collection because it's like technically like abandonware, you know?

579
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:14,500
So like I had to like go on eBay and like buy the CD to play this game.

580
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,480
And like I had to...

581
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,480
It was...

582
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:20,460
It was...

583
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:26,140
So hard to get a physical copy of Sonic Dream Collection.

584
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:31,780
And I had to spend so much money on eBay to...

585
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:32,380
Wait, I got mail?

586
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:33,880
Where did I get mail?

587
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:42,920
I had to spend so much money trying to find a physical copy.

588
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:45,020
Because it's like from 96, you know?

589
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,640
Like how...

590
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,320
Of course it's gonna be difficult.

591
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,800
It's literally from 96.

592
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,200
Alright, give me a sec.

593
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:52,300
I need to find a way to...

594
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:56,060
Okay, Sonic Dream Collection.

595
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,000
Where the fuck is the adapter?

596
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:00,280
Where is the adapt...

597
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,640
Guys, give me a sec.

598
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:06,340
I am going through some stuff because I don't know where the adapter is right now.

599
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,260
I don't know.

600
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:11,600
Some things are meant to be lost in...

601
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,580
What do you mean?

602
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:17,520
This is known as one of the best Sonic games of our generation.

603
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:19,620
And like pre-generation.

604
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:21,080
Of any generation.

605
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:24,660
It is the best Sonic game.

606
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:26,140
Ever.

607
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:29,460
Anyway, how do I get the network adapter?

608
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:31,680
How do I get the adapter?

609
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:39,600
I gotta install MSN Messenger.

610
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:42,000
The driver is in the CD.

611
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,440
Where in the CD?

612
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,960
Do I take the CD out?

613
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,760
It's in the game files?

614
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:48,900
Oh my god.

615
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:50,400
Okay guys, give me a sec.

616
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:50,880
Sorry.

617
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:53,260
I didn't grow up with Sonic...

618
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:53,720
It's okay.

619
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:57,920
Thank God we have people that have grown up with the Sonic Dream Collection.

620
00:27:58,220 --> 00:28:00,540
That has the step-by-step guide.

621
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,000
Uh...

622
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,180
Step-by-step guide.

623
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:06,820
On how to get these games running.

624
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:09,580
Nick, thank you for the super chat.

625
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:10,320
Thank you, thank you.

626
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:13,600
Your sponsorship with Sega has been revoked because you play this game.

627
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:14,200
That is...

628
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:16,600
How could they revoke my sponsorship with Sega?

629
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,440
When this is an official...

630
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:21,560
An official game from Sega Company.

631
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,560
How is that possible?

632
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,160
It's one of their most...

633
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:31,780
It's one of their most well-performing games.

634
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:35,040
I don't know what you're talking about.

635
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:39,940
Everyone talked about Sonic Dream Collection.

636
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:42,000
Any naughty kids in my chat?

637
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,340
Tell me about your...

638
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:46,400
Tell me about your experience with the Sonic Dream Collection.

639
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:50,620
Any naughty kids in the chat vouching for me?

640
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:55,260
Any naughty kids in the chat vouching for me?

641
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:56,100
Okay.

642
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,080
Let me see.

643
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:00,860
I'm trying to figure out how the fuck to download the...

644
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:01,320
Okay.

645
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:01,580
Let me.

646
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:02,660
There's a read me text.

647
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:04,960
Clearly I didn't read the read me text.

648
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,000
Oh shit.

649
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:08,520
Okay.

650
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:09,360
Wait a minute.

651
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,240
Okay.

652
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:11,260
Okay.

653
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:11,800
Uh...

654
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:15,400
Hahahaha Alright.

655
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:16,860
Wait, wait.

656
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,020
Okay, give me a sec.

657
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,440
I'm trying to figure out...

658
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,780
I'm trying to figure out how to download the adap- Guys!

659
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:23,120
I need a step-by-step guide!

660
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:24,880
How do I get the...

661
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:27,280
How do I get the adapter, guys?

662
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:28,340
Oh my god!

663
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:29,640
It did take the screenshot!

664
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:32,040
And I found the screenshot!

665
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,520
I found the screenshot though.

666
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,120
Oh, it's extra data files?

667
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:38,440
Oh my god, I'm gonna start- Okay, extra...

668
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,800
Unsafe file.

669
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:42,580
Wait, isn't the unsafe file used at your own risk?

670
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:43,640
Oh my god!

671
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:43,980
Alright.

672
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:45,340
We can use this.

673
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,940
We're gonna use at our own risk.

674
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:47,640
Okay.

675
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:50,560
After that, you'll find the- Okay.

676
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:53,840
Unsafe file used at my own risk.

677
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,340
Okay, I got that.

678
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,800
What do I do after that?

679
00:29:57,040 --> 00:30:00,020
Oh my god, I already lost the step-by-step guide that you guys gave me.

680
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:01,700
Um, corrupted data.

681
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:03,080
Okay, corrupted data.

682
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:03,980
Alright.

683
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:05,400
Oh, there's a SIGNET!

684
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:06,520
I got SIGNET!

685
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,420
Alright, I'm installing it.

686
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,500
I'm installing SIGNET right now.

687
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:10,980
Okay.

688
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:13,040
We have to create a username?

689
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,140
Uhhh...

690
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,180
Joke... Jokey bird.

691
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:22,040
Um...

692
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:23,940
Don't hack into my SIGNET.

693
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,000
It's 1234.

694
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,060
Password.

695
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:28,320
Wait, it doesn't work?!

696
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:30,260
What?!

697
00:30:31,250 --> 00:30:31,600
Guys!

698
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:34,540
1234, it doesn't work!

699
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,740
Jokey bird is already taken?!

700
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:43,680
Who took my account?!

701
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:48,420
Who took my account?!

702
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:49,280
Who did it?

703
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:55,080
The code is hidden in 98.

704
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:56,260
Alright, sorry.

705
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:59,740
Unfortunately, we won't be able to- We'll figure it out.

706
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:00,780
We'll figure it out.

707
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,120
We'll go to Sonic Movie Maker.

708
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:02,860
Alright.

709
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:06,260
Sonic Movie Maker was many years ahead of its time.

710
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:16,440
Technically speaking, MJ Studio envisioned a movie making program for players to explore and share their desires with the rest of the world.

711
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:17,620
Internal...

712
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:19,540
The 90s.

713
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:21,220
Jokey bird took my account.

714
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:23,400
Jokey bird from 96.

715
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:34,240
Internal notes suggest that Sega executives pulled the plug after learning about some of Sonic Movie Maker's darker subplots.

716
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,200
Um...

717
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,440
Oh my god.

718
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:37,240
Don't worry.

719
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:42,080
Those who had FOMO were able to grab a copy of Sonic Movie Maker.

720
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:45,060
So this was like a partnership with Microsoft.

721
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:50,740
Because like, you know how like some companies want to add like a little spice to like a little crossover collab?

722
00:31:51,140 --> 00:32:00,040
So like Microsoft Movie Maker collabed with Sonic, with Sega, to make like a Sega skin for like Movie Maker.

723
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:01,580
So, uh...

724
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:02,520
So that's great!

725
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,220
It was like really easy back then.

726
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:05,420
To like make movies.

727
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,320
Like that.

728
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,060
Oh my god!

729
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:11,240
The Sonic Movie Maker!

730
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:16,800
It was the precursor for Miku Miku Dance.

731
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,180
Good times!

732
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:21,280
Alright.

733
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:27,120
Let's make a movie, Sonic!

734
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:29,900
Woo!

735
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:31,660
Okay, how do I play?

736
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:35,220
Apprendi...

737
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:35,800

738
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:36,480

739
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:36,900

00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:37,620
Regla...

741
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:39,200
Basic Control.

742
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:39,840
Okay.

743
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:41,400
Controls...

744
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:42,820

Oh, left mouse click is grab.

752
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:51,740

00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:53,320

760
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:02,480

761
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:03,680

00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:04,440

763
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,280

Escape, grab object and cycle filters.

767
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:10,400
What are tips?

768
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:13,920
A steady hand is the first step to a great film.

769
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:18,060
Hold right click to enter record mode and steady the camera.

770
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:24,260
Once you're done filming, walk through the red exit door to show Sonic you're satisfied with the day's shoot.

771
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:25,080
Uh...

772
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:30,160
While grabbing the prop, you can use the scroll wheel to pull or push it.

773
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:33,600
Use the E key to grab objects while filming.

774
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:34,380
Uh...

775
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:37,260
Sonic and his pals love touching different props.

776
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:38,800
Experiment to find out.

777
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:39,640
Right, witch.

778
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:40,480
Thank you for the super chat.

779
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:40,820
Thank you.

780
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:41,260
Thank you.

781
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:44,160
Sonic Dreams Collection marked the end of my childhood innocence.

782
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:47,220
After playing it, I was no longer a mere girl.

783
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:48,960
I was a hedgehog.

784
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:51,040
And I was fast.

785
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:52,260
Thank you for the super chat.

786
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:52,600
Thank you.

787
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:52,980
Thank you.

788
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:53,900
Look at that.

789
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:57,280
A 90s kid vouched for my...

790
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:58,140
For this game.

791
00:33:58,420 --> 00:34:00,400
You can always trust 90s kids.

792
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:02,740
They've been through a lot.

793
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:03,660
I'm not kidding.

794
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:05,760
Alright, let's go to the backyard.

795
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:06,700
Whoa!

796
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,500
This sensitivity.

797
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:11,480
Welcome to Sonic Movie Maker.

798
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:14,060
Left click, and scroll, okay.

799
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,000
Alright.

800
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:16,040
Nice.

801
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:18,680
Hello, Sonic.

802
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:21,060
Whoa!

803
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,540
This sensitivity, though.

804
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:25,120
Can I grab this?

805
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:26,020
No, I can't.

806
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:27,400
Can I grab Sonic, though?

807
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:28,560
Okay.

808
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,040
Right click to focus.

809
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:32,440
Left click while focus is recorded.

810
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:33,740
Alright, Sonic.

811
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:35,580
I'm gonna grab you real quick.

812
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:38,500
Alright, we're gonna have you...

813
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:41,280
We're gonna have you on the car.

814
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:42,440
Now be... Whoa!

815
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:44,700
Sonic, I need you on top of the car!

816
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:46,560
Sonic, please!

817
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:47,680
Wait, is that a diaper?

818
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:48,820
Sonic?

819
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:53,720
Is that... is that Sonic?

820
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:58,440
Wait, when you're done walk through the exit to walk in.

821
00:34:58,700 --> 00:34:59,180
Alright.

822
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:00,760
Oh, hey there is!

823
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:03,320
Toss a ball, Dad!

824
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:05,800
Okay, I love my dad.

825
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,920
Alright, let's make a story.

826
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,020
Alright, Sonic.

827
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:12,480
I need you to... Okay, here we go.

828
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:14,060
I need you to stay here.

829
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:15,180
Alright?

830
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:16,600
Alright, Sonic?

831
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:18,820
I need you to say, I love my dad.

832
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:19,800
Alright?

833
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:22,860
But we all know you have daddy issues though.

834
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:23,820
Alright.

835
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:25,140
Here we go.

836
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:26,920
I love my dad.

837
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:28,640
Alright, and then...

838
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,080
And then...

839
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,700
What happens is that...

840
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,480
Is that you throw a ball...

841
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,520
Oh my God!

842
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,380
We throw the ball up in the sky.

843
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:42,900
Wait, where did the ball go?

844
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,860
Wait, where the fuck did the ball go?

845
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:47,860
Wait...

846
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:49,500
What the fuck?

847
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:58,040
Alright, alright, the ball is gone!

848
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:00,720
The ball is now gone forever!

849
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:02,980
Alright... Oh, there's the ball!

850
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:05,220
Okay, okay, we're gonna put you under the car.

851
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:09,000
Um, because a car... You got...

852
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,840
Now you have... You're gonna commit insurance fraud.

853
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:15,500
Cause dad suggested you to commit some insurance fraud.

854
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:18,580
Cause dad is not doing so well financially right now.

855
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:22,020
So, we have to film this for insurance.

856
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:25,020
Alright, we're gonna put you under here.

857
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:29,600
How do we lead from insurance fraud to playing catch?

858
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:30,780
It's alright.

859
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,860
This is a very low budget film.

860
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:36,120
Alright, nice.

861
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,340
Good job, Sonic.

862
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:38,600
This is fun!

863
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:39,220
Alright!

864
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,100
And I'm done.

865
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:40,380
Wait.

866
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:41,700
Yeah, and I'm done.

867
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:43,820
Exit.

868
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:44,880
How do I leave?

869
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,140
Oh, I have to film fully?

870
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,620
Okay, what else can we do?

871
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:50,640
Wait, what's over here?

872
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:52,180
Wait, I came from here.

873
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:54,720
Alright, and now we'll fix it in post.

874
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,120
Yeah, we're gonna fix this in post.

875
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,120
Shadow, thank you for the aqua soup!

876
00:36:58,360 --> 00:36:59,540
Thank you, thank you!

877
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:01,400
It's like taking candy from a baby.

878
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:02,380
Which is fine.

879
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:03,720
It's fine by me.

880
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:06,900
And then after that...

881
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:08,980
After that...

882
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:10,980
You just wanna go home.

883
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,260
You're done.

884
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:15,220
You just wanted to go home.

885
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:17,240
You didn't wanna be here anymore.

886
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:18,560
Yay!

887
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:19,580
Film's done!

888
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:20,780
Head for the exit!

889
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:21,720
Alright.

890
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:25,800
This is a snail dog!

891
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:35,680
The feeder is sold out?!

892
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:39,120
Oh my god!

893
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,240
Let's go home!

894
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:56,000
Look at that!

895
00:37:56,650 --> 00:37:58,040
I love my dad.

896
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:59,800
This is fun.

897
00:38:00,650 --> 00:38:02,060
Let's go home.

898
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:04,240
Isn't that great?

899
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,060
I'm so proud of Sonic.

900
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:15,340
What a beautiful movie.

901
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:17,160
It got sold out too!

902
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:19,880
Oh my god!

903
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:21,860
I am a great director.

904
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:22,960
Alright, next scene.

905
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,600
Absolute cinema right there.

906
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:26,220
Pull me.

907
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:27,500
Alright.

908
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:29,600
What is this?

909
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:31,840
Oh!

910
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:33,240
It's Promete!

911
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:34,960
Promete!

912
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:42,220
Don't worry so- Okay, I need to know if I can adjust the sensitivity.

913
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:44,900
Sonic!

914
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:46,440
It's time!

915
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:49,180
Oh my god!

916
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:49,700
Okay.

917
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,440
Alright, here we go.

918
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:52,540
It's okay.

919
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:53,640
You're gonna be...

920
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:54,200
Oh my god!

921
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:55,340
Rouge the Bat too!

922
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:56,740
Oh my god, Sonic!

923
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:58,740
You know how to pick women!

924
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:00,820
Wait, you're like stuck to each other.

925
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:01,720
Wait, this is not good.

926
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:02,420
Wait.

927
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:04,580
Guys!

928
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,660
You're not supposed to be stuck to each other yet!

929
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:08,060
Not yet!

930
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:08,940
Okay.

931
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,160
Let's dance.

932
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:14,860
And then we're gonna have close-up.

933
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:16,000
We're gonna have a close-up shot.

934
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,820
Of a pineapple for like...

935
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:20,660
And also the ice cream.

936
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:21,200
Yes, yes.

937
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:22,780
A close-up shot of the ice cream.

938
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:23,900
Oh my god.

939
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:24,300
Perfect.

940
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:26,900
Alright, and then after that...

941
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:30,720
Let's have like a side shot from the side as if I'm like...

942
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,460
A voyeur right here.

943
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:33,980
Ooh, yeah.

944
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:35,780
You go, Sonic.

945
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:38,060
Like right here as if I'm a voyeur.

946
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:50,660
And then we'll slowly scroll closer.

947
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:52,180
And...

948
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:54,080
There you go.

949
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:54,660
It's good.

950
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:55,320
There.

951
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,320
No, I'm kidding.

952
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:57,040
Why?!

953
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:59,240
What do you mean?!

954
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:03,060
Wait, there's more?!

955
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:03,760
Oh!

956
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:09,040
Oh, I have filters!

957
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:11,280
Oh my god, I have filters.

958
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:12,480
I forgot about that.

959
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:15,160
I forgot about...

960
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:15,940
Oh my god.

961
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:17,740
I forgot about the filters...

962
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:19,720
Okay.

963
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:20,880
Alright.

964
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:23,160
It's good that I didn't find any.

965
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:25,740
It's good that I didn't find these.

966
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:29,260
Okay, let's head out to the exit.

967
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:30,480
Alright.

968
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:32,720
Let's leave, guys.

969
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:34,680
I'm glad I- Wait, there's more!

970
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:35,960
What's this?

971
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:38,320
That is...

972
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:40,920
Did they just take a picture of me?

973
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,440
Alright, what's this?

974
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:43,500
Okay.

975
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,220
It's alright, we're good.

976
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,180
This film is over.

977
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:48,460
Oh, I should put in night vision.

978
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:48,920
I know.

979
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:50,220
Now that I know...

980
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:56,060
Now that I know there's like filters, we can have like black and white films.

981
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:58,540
To show that it's like, you know...

982
00:40:58,540 --> 00:40:58,820
Uh...

983
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,040
It's a hit!

984
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:02,640
I knew it!

985
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:05,040
Oh, it's perfect!

986
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:10,260
I can have black and white films, cause they're extra classy.

987
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:12,900
It's extra classy, you know?

988
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:15,360
That's like Oscar worthy right there.

989
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:20,200
Chat, it's Oscar worthy when you know it's black and white.

990
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:23,960
Film noir!

991
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:24,740
Exactly!

992
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:26,120
Film noir!

993
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:27,480
Right there.

994
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:31,260
I knew I had some cinema fanatics right there.

995
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:32,780
And I know exactly what I'm...

996
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:33,020
Oh.

997
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:34,200
Oh, it's a hotel.

998
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:35,680
That's classier than a motel.

999
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:36,860
You know?

1000
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:37,800
Good for them!

1001
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:42,640
Good for them that they can afford a hotel instead...

1002
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:43,260
Why is there a...

1003
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:44,520
What was this?

1004
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,120
Why is there a van here?

1005
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:49,900
Good for them that they can afford a hotel.

1006
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:52,660
Instead of a motel.

1007
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:55,800
Um, cause it's like prom night, you know?

1008
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:56,820
There...

1009
00:41:56,820 --> 00:41:57,640
Oh, no.

1010
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:00,400
It's university prom night.

1011
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:01,280
It's...

1012
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:07,260
It's...

1013
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:08,600
It's university...

1014
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:10,600
Wait, check the alley?

1015
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:11,760
What's... Where's the alley?

1016
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:13,780
Where's...

1017
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:15,500
Where's... Is this the alley?

1018
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:18,240
What's in the alley?

1019
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:21,440
Guys, we don't hear anything in the silence.

1020
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:23,220
Guys, don't worry.

1021
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:28,500
Is this...

1022
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:29,580
Is this...

1023
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:33,420
Is this the alley?

1024
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,640
We'll check the room later.

1025
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:37,260
I just...

1026
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:38,460
Wait, who the fuck is that?

1027
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:41,120
Who are you?

1028
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:42,900
Hello?

1029
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:46,460
You're an egg!

1030
00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:48,240
Is this Eggman Origins?

1031
00:42:49,220 --> 00:42:50,300
I love Tails.

1032
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:52,620
But I'm so shy.

1033
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:54,740
Who are you?

1034
00:42:56,420 --> 00:42:56,820
Iggy?

1035
00:42:58,240 --> 00:42:58,900
Oh, God.

1036
00:42:58,980 --> 00:42:59,400
I thought I...

1037
00:42:59,400 --> 00:42:59,800
Oh, my God.

1038
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:00,280
That scared me.

1039
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:00,900
I thought like I...

1040
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:02,540
He like teleported in front of me.

1041
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:03,760
Oh, my God.

1042
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:07,900
Astro, thank you for the one gifted chip.

1043
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:08,460
Thank you.

1044
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:09,200
Thank you.

1045
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:11,040
Oh, my God.

1046
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:13,940
I thought he actually teleported in front of me.

1047
00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:15,500
I was gonna be like, holy shit.

1048
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:18,100
That's his lore.

1049
00:43:18,460 --> 00:43:19,480
He likes Tails.

1050
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:19,940
He likes Tails.

1051
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:23,140
Alright, here we go.

1052
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:24,440
Let's head up.

1053
00:43:28,460 --> 00:43:31,840
Modern Sonic games would never do stuff like this anymore.

1054
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:32,480
They don't...

1055
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:34,040
They don't like fucking...

1056
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:34,940
You know...

1057
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:36,760
Go out of their comfort zone.

1058
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:39,420
It makes me so upset.

1059
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:40,080
Wait, Tails?

1060
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:41,600
Tails?

1061
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:42,680
What's going on, Tails?

1062
00:43:44,380 --> 00:43:45,380
What's going on?

1063
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:45,920
Oh, okay.

1064
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:46,520
Film noir.

1065
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:47,320
Wait.

1066
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:48,720
Wait, this is worse.

1067
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:52,200
No way.

1068
00:43:53,020 --> 00:43:54,540
Oh, my God.

1069
00:43:55,820 --> 00:43:56,300
Shadow?

1070
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:01,960
Whoa.

1071
00:44:03,860 --> 00:44:05,200
But what about...

1072
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:05,800
Oh, okay.

1073
00:44:06,540 --> 00:44:07,520
Okay, we got it.

1074
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:08,280
I'm gonna...

1075
00:44:09,740 --> 00:44:11,840
Okay, because I feel bad for you, Tails.

1076
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:12,800
Alright.

1077
00:44:13,580 --> 00:44:15,300
Alright, we're gonna put you in there.

1078
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:17,080
Tails, I feel so bad for you.

1079
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:17,500
Don't...

1080
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:18,740
Yeah, Tails.

1081
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:19,580
Yeah, Tails.

1082
00:44:19,580 --> 00:44:19,880
Oh, my God.

1083
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:20,640
李 네.

1084
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:21,880
What's this?

1085
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:24,860
Wait.

1086
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:25,340
Actually...

1087
00:44:25,340 --> 00:44:27,120
Get Tails out of here.

1088
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:29,400
Actually, no.

1089
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:30,880
Amy...

1090
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:31,760
Wait.

1091
00:44:31,780 --> 00:44:32,760
We're attached to somebody?

1092
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:33,400
No, you're not.

1093
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:33,740
Alright.

1094
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:34,160
Here we go.

1095
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:35,160
Alright.

1096
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:37,360
Alright, you're gonna be in the corner.

1097
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:38,220
Tails is...

1098
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:39,300
You're subbing out for Tails.

1099
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:40,440
Right here.

1100
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:42,620
You're subbing out for Ta...

1101
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:46,060
Tails wanna have fun.

1102
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:49,280
Okay.

1103
00:44:50,540 --> 00:44:51,500
Not this...

1104
00:44:51,820 --> 00:44:52,200
Alright.

1105
00:44:53,220 --> 00:44:54,280
There you go.

1106
00:44:56,780 --> 00:44:57,460
Alright.

1107
00:44:58,240 --> 00:44:58,920
Nice.

1108
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:00,880
Okay, I'm lonely.

1109
00:45:01,420 --> 00:45:04,480
And now, we gotta have close-ups of this...

1110
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:08,100
Of this very fun time.

1111
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:13,240
Wait!

1112
00:45:13,660 --> 00:45:14,480
Sonic, no!

1113
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:15,140
That's Tails!

1114
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:18,060
Sonic, no!

1115
00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:19,160
That's Tails!

1116
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:24,360
Wait, bring Tails to Iggy?

1117
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:25,200
Alright, Tails.

1118
00:45:25,620 --> 00:45:28,300
Alright, we're gonna include a surprise third.

1119
00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:30,440
Alright, Tails, come over here.

1120
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:33,080
We're gonna give you love.

1121
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:34,920
We're gonna find you love!

1122
00:45:36,260 --> 00:45:37,080
It's alright.

1123
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:39,040
It's okay.

1124
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:40,420
Don't worry.

1125
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:45,760
As we all know, Sonic characters are always thinking about protection.

1126
00:45:46,420 --> 00:45:48,220
Guys, don't worry.

1127
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:49,920
Stay safe, kids.

1128
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:51,500
Um, college students.

1129
00:45:51,820 --> 00:45:52,760
Stay safe!

1130
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:56,600
Cause this is university prom night!

1131
00:45:57,260 --> 00:45:59,840
Stay safe, university students!

1132
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:02,580
Alright, Iggy, get over here.

1133
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:04,460
Get over here.

1134
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:07,280
Alright, here you go, Iggy.

1135
00:46:08,820 --> 00:46:09,760
Here you go.

1136
00:46:13,820 --> 00:46:16,340
My dream co- What the fuck is that?

1137
00:46:18,580 --> 00:46:21,200
Why is there a fire with hearts?

1138
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:24,920
Oh my god.

1139
00:46:26,420 --> 00:46:27,580
What the fuck is this?

1140
00:46:29,380 --> 00:46:31,860
Are you happy now, Mr. Iggy?

1141
00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:34,180
Can I bring this over?

1142
00:46:34,980 --> 00:46:36,280
Oh, haha.

1143
00:46:37,580 --> 00:46:38,640
Firey passion.

1144
00:46:41,580 --> 00:46:43,440
Doll, thank you for the super chat.

1145
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:44,720
Thank you, thank you.

1146
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,560
Oh my god, this is so trippy.

1147
00:46:48,660 --> 00:46:49,780
It's burning.

1148
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,120
What is this game?

1149
00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:53,600
It's the best Sonic game they've ever made!

1150
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:54,980
What do you mean?

1151
00:46:56,180 --> 00:46:59,440
This is the best Sonic game that's ever created.

1152
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:04,480
God, I can't- Why would I need to remind you guys over and over?

1153
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:06,160
You can tell this is a really good game.

1154
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:08,020
Like, you can tell.

1155
00:47:08,140 --> 00:47:10,540
There should be no reminding you of this.

1156
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:12,040
Of this fact.

1157
00:47:13,660 --> 00:47:15,400
This was our childhood.

1158
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:18,120
When we were university students.

1159
00:47:20,740 --> 00:47:21,780
University childhood!

1160
00:47:23,820 --> 00:47:24,380
Alright.

1161
00:47:24,580 --> 00:47:25,960
What was this movie like?

1162
00:47:27,460 --> 00:47:28,020
Whoa.

1163
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:31,140
Look at that.

1164
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:33,980
The close-up!

1165
00:47:39,620 --> 00:47:41,640
The fucking- Okay.

1166
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:43,780
The close-up is really good.

1167
00:47:43,820 --> 00:47:45,900
I really like the choice of that.

1168
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:50,200
I really- I think like I outdid myself with the close-up.

1169
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:51,640
I'm not even kidding.

1170
00:47:53,220 --> 00:47:53,940
I'm not kidding.

1171
00:47:53,940 --> 00:47:55,660
I think this is the best one yet, honestly.

1172
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:57,180
Alright, next scene.

1173
00:47:58,460 --> 00:47:59,300
Wait.

1174
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:00,960
Try using E.

1175
00:48:01,140 --> 00:48:02,220
Wait, what?

1176
00:48:04,820 --> 00:48:06,160
Where's the camera?

1177
00:48:07,780 --> 00:48:08,200
Huh?

1178
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:10,320
Oh.

1179
00:48:12,580 --> 00:48:14,480
But, where's the camera?

1180
00:48:16,620 --> 00:48:17,460
Sonic?

1181
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:19,780
You're not Sonic 2?

1182
00:48:20,180 --> 00:48:22,320
What's going on, Sonic?

1183
00:48:22,460 --> 00:48:22,820
What's going on, Sonic?

1184
00:48:26,730 --> 00:48:27,090
Oh!

1185
00:48:31,630 --> 00:48:34,230
Where's my- Where's my camcorder?

1186
00:48:36,150 --> 00:48:37,950
Where- Oh!

1187
00:48:37,950 --> 00:48:38,670
There it is!

1188
00:48:39,410 --> 00:48:40,090
Oh my god!

1189
00:48:40,110 --> 00:48:40,570
Thank god!

1190
00:48:40,590 --> 00:48:41,530
I thought I was gonna miss out!

1191
00:48:41,990 --> 00:48:42,830
Oh, thank god!

1192
00:48:42,950 --> 00:48:44,270
Okay, thank- Okay, now we're fine.

1193
00:48:44,470 --> 00:48:44,730
Alright.

1194
00:48:45,430 --> 00:48:47,830
Getting a close-up of your stomach to know that...

1195
00:48:49,010 --> 00:48:49,370
Uh...

1196
00:48:49,370 --> 00:48:50,610
To know that it's growing.

1197
00:48:51,130 --> 00:48:52,150
Oh, thank- Thank god!

1198
00:48:52,250 --> 00:48:53,510
Okay, I thought I was gonna miss out.

1199
00:48:53,670 --> 00:48:55,050
I thought I was gonna miss out on this recording.

1200
00:48:55,430 --> 00:48:55,990
I think-

1201
00:49:00,410 --> 00:49:03,410
I'm so happy I- I got this!

1202
00:49:03,970 --> 00:49:04,450
Alright.

1203
00:49:05,550 --> 00:49:06,030
Ooh.

1204
00:49:06,790 --> 00:49:07,790
Yeah, yeah, like that.

1205
00:49:07,990 --> 00:49:08,830
And then...

1206
00:49:08,830 --> 00:49:10,690
Uh, we need the grainy.

1207
00:49:11,990 --> 00:49:13,790
Feed me more...

1208
00:49:13,790 --> 00:49:14,570
There we go.

1209
00:49:14,810 --> 00:49:16,190
And then close up here.

1210
00:49:17,150 --> 00:49:19,270
Feed me more...

1211
00:49:19,910 --> 00:49:20,390
Nice.

1212
00:49:20,470 --> 00:49:22,190
Alright, and then now we're gonna feed you.

1213
00:49:23,630 --> 00:49:24,870
We're gonna feed you now.

1214
00:49:25,150 --> 00:49:26,410
Alright, do you like...

1215
00:49:26,970 --> 00:49:27,690
Here you go.

1216
00:49:29,030 --> 00:49:29,550
Ooh!

1217
00:49:30,910 --> 00:49:31,730
Look at that!

1218
00:49:31,790 --> 00:49:33,530
I think we can keep feeding you, Sonic!

1219
00:49:34,030 --> 00:49:35,130
Are you hungry?

1220
00:49:37,170 --> 00:49:38,050
Eat up!

1221
00:49:38,370 --> 00:49:40,330
Eat up and be a good boy!

1222
00:49:41,090 --> 00:49:42,290
Eat up, Sonic!

1223
00:49:42,710 --> 00:49:43,970
Ooh, nice!

1224
00:49:44,370 --> 00:49:46,470
Alright, I think we can keep feeding you.

1225
00:49:49,410 --> 00:49:50,450
Come on!

1226
00:49:50,590 --> 00:49:53,090
You can get bigger than that, Sonic!

1227
00:49:53,630 --> 00:49:55,290
Eat it for the Oscars!

1228
00:49:57,230 --> 00:49:59,950
Don't you want a Golden Globe, Sonic?

1229
00:50:00,490 --> 00:50:02,770
You know you want a Golden Globe!

1230
00:50:06,410 --> 00:50:08,290
Please don't keep- don't!

1231
00:50:08,770 --> 00:50:10,010
Guys, this is important!

1232
00:50:10,250 --> 00:50:11,270
We won an Oscar!

1233
00:50:13,970 --> 00:50:14,490
Oh...

1234
00:50:15,090 --> 00:50:16,690
You want more?

1235
00:50:18,210 --> 00:50:21,230
He did say he wanna feed me more- No!

1236
00:50:21,570 --> 00:50:22,710
Is that- oh, good, okay.

1237
00:50:22,890 --> 00:50:24,390
I thought they were gonna cut me off.

1238
00:50:25,770 --> 00:50:27,130
Come on, Sonic!

1239
00:50:28,750 --> 00:50:30,690
You know you want more!

1240
00:50:31,270 --> 00:50:31,570
Oh!

1241
00:50:32,050 --> 00:50:33,030
Nice, okay.

1242
00:50:34,750 --> 00:50:35,690
There we go.

1243
00:50:36,810 --> 00:50:37,410
Nice.

1244
00:50:37,670 --> 00:50:38,170
Alright.

1245
00:50:38,510 --> 00:50:39,750
They took it away!

1246
00:50:40,650 --> 00:50:41,550
Oh, Tails!

1247
00:50:41,970 --> 00:50:42,970
Happy birthday, Tails!

1248
00:50:44,550 --> 00:50:46,190
Can I feed Tails?

1249
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:48,250
Will you eat Tails?

1250
00:50:49,250 --> 00:50:52,090
You're not gonna eat Tails- Alright.

1251
00:50:55,570 --> 00:50:56,630
Alright.

1252
00:51:01,770 --> 00:51:03,670
Alright, I'm gonna leave now.

1253
00:51:04,110 --> 00:51:05,630
I think we saw the movie.

1254
00:51:06,370 --> 00:51:08,830
I think we saw the movie!

1255
00:51:13,130 --> 00:51:15,130
Oh like, it gives me chills!

1256
00:51:15,310 --> 00:51:15,490
Look!

1257
00:51:19,100 --> 00:51:20,280
Feed me more.

1258
00:51:21,140 --> 00:51:21,820
Yes!

1259
00:51:22,020 --> 00:51:23,420
Feed me more!

1260
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:32,360
Okay, the glitch effect is actually really good.

1261
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:36,020
Not gonna lie, the glitch effect really sells this for me.

1262
00:51:36,220 --> 00:51:40,720
I'm honestly improving more and more as a director.

1263
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:43,980
Cass, it's better not wake up when something is in me.

1264
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:45,380
Thank you for the super chat.

1265
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:46,640
Thank you, thank you.

1266
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:54,320
Not gonna lie, I think I'm... Oh my god!

1267
00:51:54,460 --> 00:51:55,740
Is someone Pregante?

1268
00:51:56,520 --> 00:51:57,720
Who's Pregante?

1269
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:03,740
Who's the father?

1270
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:04,940
Shadow?

1271
00:52:07,020 --> 00:52:08,420
Where's the camera though?

1272
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:11,360
Where's the camera?

1273
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:16,820
Oh god, wait, wait, don't do anything Sonic!

1274
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:17,220
Not yet!

1275
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:18,160
Sonic!

1276
00:52:19,060 --> 00:52:20,160
Sonic, not yet!

1277
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:22,340
I need to find the camera!

1278
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:24,760
No, not yet!

1279
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:29,100
Please stop smashing the glass, never.

1280
00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:30,340
There it is!

1281
00:52:31,060 --> 00:52:31,960
There it is!

1282
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:34,220
Oh my god, there we go.

1283
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:36,900
Okay, I got the camera.

1284
00:52:37,140 --> 00:52:37,340
Okay.

1285
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:39,100
I'm not the father.

1286
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:40,040
I'm the father.

1287
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:41,680
Who's gonna be the father?

1288
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:44,740
Alright guys, who's gonna be the father?

1289
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:46,360
It has to be Eggman!

1290
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:48,320
It has to be Eggman!

1291
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:49,600
Let me in!

1292
00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:50,800
I need to get to Eggman!

1293
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:51,620
Right now!

1294
00:52:56,540 --> 00:52:57,640
Get over here!

1295
00:52:57,960 --> 00:52:59,180
This is for my movie!

1296
00:53:00,820 --> 00:53:02,000
Give me Eggman!

1297
00:53:05,620 --> 00:53:07,140
Eggman, we need you to be the father!

1298
00:53:07,220 --> 00:53:07,880
Get over here!

1299
00:53:10,690 --> 00:53:12,370
I'm casting you as the father!

1300
00:53:13,770 --> 00:53:14,570
Okay, alright.

1301
00:53:14,790 --> 00:53:16,150
You can sort of see it here.

1302
00:53:16,270 --> 00:53:16,730
There we go.

1303
00:53:16,730 --> 00:53:18,330
Alright, this works.

1304
00:53:18,830 --> 00:53:19,770
I'm the father.

1305
00:53:20,330 --> 00:53:23,650
Alright, ask me how to avoid rashes.

1306
00:53:23,890 --> 00:53:24,330
Okay.

1307
00:53:24,530 --> 00:53:25,610
Alright, that's good enough.

1308
00:53:26,970 --> 00:53:27,410
Uhh...

1309
00:53:29,030 --> 00:53:33,650
We'll put... It's not easy being pregnant right here.

1310
00:53:34,070 --> 00:53:35,890
And then I'm gonna put a filter.

1311
00:53:37,330 --> 00:53:37,770
Uhh...

1312
00:53:38,610 --> 00:53:41,290
Let's see, it's not a horror film anymore so we should do black and white.

1313
00:53:41,430 --> 00:53:42,630
It's a black and white film!

1314
00:53:42,710 --> 00:53:43,290
Right now, okay.

1315
00:53:43,570 --> 00:53:44,830
This is gonna be Oscar worthy.

1316
00:53:44,830 --> 00:53:47,450
This is what's gonna get me an Oscar!

1317
00:53:47,650 --> 00:53:53,710
We're gonna put this in Best Director of 2024.

1318
00:53:54,330 --> 00:53:57,310
Alright, it's not easy being pregnant.

1319
00:53:57,770 --> 00:53:59,510
Alright, and then...

1320
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:03,490
And then we're gonna be... Amy's gonna be like...

1321
00:54:03,490 --> 00:54:06,830
Right after like, we smash through this...

1322
00:54:10,490 --> 00:54:11,070
Came out!

1323
00:54:11,630 --> 00:54:12,490
Oh my god!

1324
00:54:12,950 --> 00:54:15,950
The child comes out and then Amy's gonna be like...

1325
00:54:15,950 --> 00:54:17,390
Great job, Sonic!

1326
00:54:22,870 --> 00:54:23,310
Okay.

1327
00:54:23,950 --> 00:54:26,070
Alright, I gotta make sure I get this.

1328
00:54:26,490 --> 00:54:27,170
Wait, no?

1329
00:54:27,610 --> 00:54:28,050
Come on.

1330
00:54:30,250 --> 00:54:30,990
Oh, nice!

1331
00:54:31,250 --> 00:54:31,730
We got it!

1332
00:54:31,750 --> 00:54:32,170
We got the shot!

1333
00:54:32,250 --> 00:54:32,670
We got the shot!

1334
00:54:32,810 --> 00:54:33,630
Oh my god!

1335
00:54:33,690 --> 00:54:34,410
And it's the...

1336
00:54:34,410 --> 00:54:36,370
And it's the only shot that's in color.

1337
00:54:36,610 --> 00:54:38,550
This is gonna be the only shot that's in color.

1338
00:54:38,810 --> 00:54:39,870
And then...

1339
00:54:40,810 --> 00:54:41,250
Okay.

1340
00:54:42,490 --> 00:54:42,750
Get...

1341
00:54:42,750 --> 00:54:44,890
Get me out of here!

1342
00:54:44,990 --> 00:54:47,010
Okay, we're gonna close up on this.

1343
00:54:48,090 --> 00:54:48,790
There we go.

1344
00:54:48,950 --> 00:54:50,790
Okay, wait, we're gonna move this closer...

1345
00:54:50,790 --> 00:54:53,350
To where the baby's coming out.

1346
00:54:53,650 --> 00:54:54,970
And then...

1347
00:54:56,470 --> 00:54:57,190
Okay, no.

1348
00:54:57,250 --> 00:54:58,370
The angle's not right.

1349
00:54:58,590 --> 00:54:59,050
Here.

1350
00:54:59,250 --> 00:55:00,770
This is where the angle's gonna be.

1351
00:55:01,170 --> 00:55:01,630
Alright.

1352
00:55:01,730 --> 00:55:03,430
Get me outta here.

1353
00:55:03,970 --> 00:55:04,430
Good?

1354
00:55:04,570 --> 00:55:05,290
Alright, here we go.

1355
00:55:05,470 --> 00:55:06,670
Wait, actually I need...

1356
00:55:06,670 --> 00:55:08,370
I need to move here more.

1357
00:55:08,410 --> 00:55:08,910
There we go.

1358
00:55:09,330 --> 00:55:10,870
Get me outta here.

1359
00:55:10,950 --> 00:55:11,850
Alright, one more.

1360
00:55:12,490 --> 00:55:13,550
That has to be the last one, right?

1361
00:55:14,030 --> 00:55:14,530
Oh!

1362
00:55:14,590 --> 00:55:16,350
And it was Tails all along!

1363
00:55:17,430 --> 00:55:18,210
What?

1364
00:55:19,130 --> 00:55:19,910
Congratulations!

1365
00:55:22,170 --> 00:55:23,590
Eggman and Tails!

1366
00:55:24,610 --> 00:55:25,390
Congratulations!

1367
00:55:26,410 --> 00:55:27,190
Okay.

1368
00:55:27,410 --> 00:55:28,130
Okay.

1369
00:55:28,630 --> 00:55:29,990
It's a miracle.

1370
00:55:30,830 --> 00:55:33,110
The miracle of childbirth.

1371
00:55:33,650 --> 00:55:35,330
Oh my god.

1372
00:55:35,650 --> 00:55:37,050
So beautiful.

1373
00:55:38,630 --> 00:55:40,770
So fucking beautiful!

1374
00:55:41,390 --> 00:55:42,390
It's true.

1375
00:55:42,390 --> 00:55:44,210
It truly is a miracle!

1376
00:55:44,830 --> 00:55:45,910
How do I get out?

1377
00:55:49,970 --> 00:55:51,030
Rated E for...

1378
00:55:51,030 --> 00:55:54,110
By the way, this game was like rated E for everybody, guys.

1379
00:55:54,830 --> 00:55:56,830
Writer, thank you for the 10 gifted chips!

1380
00:55:57,030 --> 00:55:57,910
Thank you, thank you!

1381
00:55:58,330 --> 00:55:59,710
Doc, thank you for the super chat!

1382
00:55:59,790 --> 00:56:00,410
Thank you, thank you!

1383
00:56:00,430 --> 00:56:02,090
Truly a cinematic masterpiece.

1384
00:56:02,910 --> 00:56:07,070
A24 would never be a director dokey.

1385
00:56:10,150 --> 00:56:10,590
Patient...

1386
00:56:10,590 --> 00:56:11,110
Wait.

1387
00:56:11,150 --> 00:56:13,470
What Rouge the Bat, Nitecore?

1388
00:56:13,870 --> 00:56:15,530
What is going on?

1389
00:56:16,490 --> 00:56:17,330
There's more?

1390
00:56:17,730 --> 00:56:19,350
I don't have enough film!

1391
00:56:23,940 --> 00:56:25,320
Wait a minute.

1392
00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:29,140
Oh, wait a minute...

1393
00:56:29,140 --> 00:56:30,580
Oh no!

1394
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:39,340
Where am I?

1395
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:40,360
Hahaha!

1396
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:51,880
Oh my god, but look at this.

1397
00:56:52,740 --> 00:56:54,580
Oh my god, it's not easy!

1398
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:05,180
Okay, that shot with the chow was really good.

1399
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:09,060
That shot with the chow...

1400
00:57:12,260 --> 00:57:14,900
I would say I actually captured...

1401
00:57:14,900 --> 00:57:17,760
I filmed that scene perfectly.

1402
00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:19,120
Oh my god.

1403
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:25,800
You can feel the trauma and the intensity of everything right now.

1404
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:27,260
You can really feel it, guys.

1405
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:28,640
You can capture those moments.

1406
00:57:29,260 --> 00:57:30,060
Oh my god.

1407
00:57:31,860 --> 00:57:34,300
Oscar nominee right there.

1408
00:57:35,860 --> 00:57:37,660
Username, thank you for the super chat.

1409
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:38,120
Thank you.

1410
00:57:39,060 --> 00:57:41,520
This is a weird Yakuza side quest, Sega.

1411
00:57:41,700 --> 00:57:48,100
Look, Yakuza took its inspiration from Sonic Movie Maker.

1412
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:50,040
You guys didn't know that.

1413
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:50,980
You guys didn't know that.

1414
00:57:53,420 --> 00:57:55,860
Look, a rowdy crowd!

1415
00:57:56,420 --> 00:57:57,380
Oh no.

1416
00:57:59,080 --> 00:57:59,700
Oh no.

1417
00:58:01,260 --> 00:58:02,960
Look, I got an emerald.

1418
00:58:03,300 --> 00:58:03,780
Yay!

1419
00:58:04,660 --> 00:58:06,560
Wow, this is a really...

1420
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:08,880
This is a really damn game.

1421
00:58:09,060 --> 00:58:09,560
Guys!

1422
00:58:11,380 --> 00:58:12,520
Hello, Iggy.

1423
00:58:13,220 --> 00:58:14,260
What do you want, Iggy?

1424
00:58:15,540 --> 00:58:16,900
Guys, it's just...

1425
00:58:16,900 --> 00:58:20,720
It's just a really damp cave, guys.

1426
00:58:21,740 --> 00:58:22,720
It's just...

1427
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:25,260
It's just a really damp cave, guys.

1428
00:58:26,100 --> 00:58:30,360
Look at this beautiful cave that I'm in.

1429
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:34,700
Okay, because we're in a cave, we need to use the grainy film.

1430
00:58:35,300 --> 00:58:36,320
Oh my god.

1431
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:37,160
Look at that.

1432
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:39,040
Let's do a close-up of this.

1433
00:58:39,060 --> 00:58:42,540
Of this dilating cave.

1434
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:53,030
Holy shit.

1435
00:58:53,110 --> 00:58:58,090
You know, I really hate it when my cave walls starts...

1436
00:58:58,090 --> 00:58:59,350
Oh no.

1437
00:59:00,090 --> 00:59:01,750
Which way does this go?

1438
00:59:05,430 --> 00:59:10,930
God, don't you hate it when you're exploring the cave and it gets like super...

1439
00:59:11,970 --> 00:59:13,430
What the fuck is that?

1440
00:59:14,650 --> 00:59:15,210
Big?

1441
00:59:16,550 --> 00:59:17,670
Big the cat?

1442
00:59:17,890 --> 00:59:19,090
What are you doing here?

1443
00:59:19,350 --> 00:59:20,970
Oh my god!

1444
00:59:25,090 --> 00:59:27,650
What the fuck are you doing here?

1445
00:59:29,530 --> 00:59:31,150
Why are you doing my cave?

1446
00:59:32,090 --> 00:59:33,470
Why are you...

1447
00:59:38,170 --> 00:59:39,090
It's okay.

1448
00:59:39,370 --> 00:59:40,190
It's okay.

1449
00:59:40,390 --> 00:59:41,330
We're gonna...

1450
00:59:41,330 --> 00:59:42,510
It's okay.

1451
00:59:42,790 --> 00:59:43,670
We're fine.

1452
00:59:43,990 --> 00:59:46,910
We're gonna... We found a cave exit, guys.

1453
00:59:47,630 --> 00:59:50,350
We found...

1454
00:59:54,680 --> 00:59:56,320
Where did the cave go?

1455
01:00:01,420 --> 01:00:04,240
Oh my god, where did the cave go?

1456
01:00:04,360 --> 01:00:05,060
Guys!

1457
01:00:09,120 --> 01:00:10,360
Wait, what?

1458
01:00:10,660 --> 01:00:11,520
What does that say?

1459
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:13,640
Smile for mommy?

1460
01:00:14,380 --> 01:00:16,980
Oops, did you have an accident?

1461
01:00:18,760 --> 01:00:21,820
Okay, let's just pull this closer to me.

1462
01:00:22,740 --> 01:00:23,340
Alright.

1463
01:00:26,300 --> 01:00:26,900
Okay.

1464
01:00:28,900 --> 01:00:30,980
Alright, and then...

1465
01:00:33,640 --> 01:00:36,400
And then we'll have Tails over here.

1466
01:00:36,840 --> 01:00:37,940
And be like...

1467
01:00:37,940 --> 01:00:39,480
Wait, what the fuck are you guys...

1468
01:00:39,480 --> 01:00:40,760
You guys just got bored.

1469
01:00:40,860 --> 01:00:41,440
What are you guys doing?

1470
01:00:42,520 --> 01:00:42,920
Mama!

1471
01:00:46,180 --> 01:00:46,580
Mama!

1472
01:00:48,120 --> 01:00:48,520
Alright!

1473
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:48,920
Guys!

1474
01:00:48,980 --> 01:00:51,900
I found the cave's exit, guys!

1475
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:53,840
Whoa!

1476
01:00:53,840 --> 01:00:54,900
Wait, what's over there?

1477
01:00:55,700 --> 01:00:56,620
I can't see that.

1478
01:00:56,660 --> 01:00:57,100
What is that?

1479
01:00:57,820 --> 01:00:58,700
What the fuck is that?

1480
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:03,180
I'm trying to scroll... scroll!

1481
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:04,640
Get over here!

1482
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:06,840
I wanna know what that says!

1483
01:01:08,340 --> 01:01:10,160
Will I ever figure out what that says?

1484
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:12,800
I can't pull it closer!

1485
01:01:14,220 --> 01:01:15,400
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

1486
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:16,720
Wait, wait, it's getting closer, it's getting closer!

1487
01:01:17,480 --> 01:01:18,260
What is this?

1488
01:01:19,260 --> 01:01:20,120
What does it say?

1489
01:01:21,540 --> 01:01:23,200
We want nothing more...

1490
01:01:27,220 --> 01:01:29,080
I guess we'll never know what that said.

1491
01:01:31,160 --> 01:01:32,500
I guess we'll never know.

1492
01:01:33,420 --> 01:01:33,940
I...

1493
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:35,120
Yes!

1494
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:40,480
I don't know.

1495
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:42,820
I guess we'll never know, guys.

1496
01:01:44,220 --> 01:01:45,400
We'll never know!

1497
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:47,280
We'll never know!

1498
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:49,100
Alright, this one's not my best work.

1499
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:50,000
I'll have to admit.

1500
01:01:50,260 --> 01:01:52,980
This one was definitely not my best work.

1501
01:01:53,020 --> 01:01:54,520
I could have done so much better.

1502
01:01:54,740 --> 01:01:55,600
I... I...

1503
01:01:55,600 --> 01:01:57,300
There was a lot going on.

1504
01:01:57,640 --> 01:02:00,480
There were too many producers!

1505
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:02,240
Okay, guys?

1506
01:02:02,340 --> 01:02:04,600
Too many producers were in the room!

1507
01:02:05,360 --> 01:02:06,820
Not my best work!

1508
01:02:07,040 --> 01:02:07,960
Not my best work!

1509
01:02:10,420 --> 01:02:11,360
Sorry, you...

1510
01:02:11,360 --> 01:02:12,940
Thank you!

1511
01:02:13,180 --> 01:02:13,780
Look!

1512
01:02:13,960 --> 01:02:15,440
A voice actor!

1513
01:02:15,660 --> 01:02:17,540
Who has lots of experience!

1514
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:20,720
Being in, like, top-rated games!

1515
01:02:21,040 --> 01:02:23,520
Can tell when this is a masterpiece!

1516
01:02:24,180 --> 01:02:25,540
That's when you know it's good!

1517
01:02:26,260 --> 01:02:28,240
That's when you know it's good, guys!

1518
01:02:28,560 --> 01:02:29,160
I'm so sorry!

1519
01:02:29,860 --> 01:02:30,460
I'm so sorry!

1520
01:02:32,700 --> 01:02:35,900
That is literally an endorsement right there!

1521
01:02:37,080 --> 01:02:38,920
They were in Genshin Impact!

1522
01:02:39,400 --> 01:02:40,740
Genshin endorsed this!

1523
01:02:44,100 --> 01:02:45,360
The testimonial!

1524
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:51,700
Wtf?

1525
01:02:51,780 --> 01:02:52,640
Oh, that's a rap!

1526
01:02:53,120 --> 01:02:53,700
Nice.

1527
01:02:53,860 --> 01:02:54,140
Okay.

1528
01:02:54,320 --> 01:02:56,000
Wait, don't say that!

1529
01:02:56,260 --> 01:02:58,020
Don't say that!

1530
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:01,220
I can't believe it!

1531
01:03:02,260 --> 01:03:10,400
The Doki Bird endorsed by Genshin Impact as one of the best directors out there.

1532
01:03:11,160 --> 01:03:12,940
With this as my proof.

1533
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:22,080
Okay, I don't know what signed guestbook is so I'm a little worried.

1534
01:03:22,180 --> 01:03:24,940
I'm gonna cover this real quick.

1535
01:03:25,420 --> 01:03:26,720
Signed guestbook.

1536
01:03:26,900 --> 01:03:28,980
Oh, your connection is not private.

1537
01:03:28,980 --> 01:03:30,940
Okay, I'm not gonna sign anything.

1538
01:03:33,640 --> 01:03:37,520
Guys we're not gonna sign anything.

1539
01:03:37,900 --> 01:03:39,440
Don't say that!

1540
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:49,560
Guys, I'm not gonna sign anything at the moment.

1541
01:03:49,980 --> 01:03:52,040
So we're not going to...

1542
01:03:52,040 --> 01:03:53,640
We're not going to...

1543
01:03:53,640 --> 01:03:57,940
I went to the website and it was like your connection is not private.

1544
01:03:58,160 --> 01:03:58,760
And I was like...

1545
01:03:58,980 --> 01:03:59,420
That's...

1546
01:03:59,420 --> 01:04:00,600
That's weird.

1547
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:03,060
That's weird.

1548
01:04:03,620 --> 01:04:04,740
Oh my god.

1549
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:05,640
Okay.

1550
01:04:05,900 --> 01:04:08,720
Alright, we're gonna go back to the title screen.

1551
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:12,420
Sonic Dream Team!

1552
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:13,560
Yay!

1553
01:04:15,580 --> 01:04:16,340
Woo!

1554
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:18,440
Download content?

1555
01:04:18,900 --> 01:04:19,380
Wait!

1556
01:04:20,660 --> 01:04:23,300
If I sign in, do I get the content?

1557
01:04:23,540 --> 01:04:25,260
Do I get the content?

1558
01:04:26,140 --> 01:04:26,780
Hahaha.

1559
01:04:26,780 --> 01:04:27,540
Hahaha.

1560
01:04:28,980 --> 01:04:30,240
So how do I...

1561
01:04:30,980 --> 01:04:31,360
Guys.

1562
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:33,120
So how...

1563
01:04:33,120 --> 01:04:34,380
How do I...

1564
01:04:35,320 --> 01:04:36,560
Get my adapter?

1565
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:38,960
Get me the adapter.

1566
01:04:43,100 --> 01:04:43,760
Alright.

1567
01:04:43,900 --> 01:04:44,620
Here we go.

1568
01:04:44,980 --> 01:04:48,600
I told you every game just gets better and better.

1569
01:04:49,300 --> 01:04:51,540
Guys, how do I get my adapter, guys?

1570
01:04:51,880 --> 01:04:54,100
How do I get my network adapter?

1571
01:04:54,820 --> 01:04:56,280
Where's the password?

1572
01:04:57,280 --> 01:04:59,340
What the fuck is the password?

1573
01:04:59,780 --> 01:05:04,720
You guys said I would find the password and username in Sonic Movie Maker.

1574
01:05:05,140 --> 01:05:06,640
Oh, is it from my roommate Sonic?

1575
01:05:07,160 --> 01:05:08,520
Oh, okay.

1576
01:05:08,740 --> 01:05:09,120
Okay.

1577
01:05:09,240 --> 01:05:09,460
Okay.

1578
01:05:09,780 --> 01:05:10,580
That's fine.

1579
01:05:10,780 --> 01:05:11,480
That's fine.

1580
01:05:11,540 --> 01:05:13,960
We'll do their best game yet.

1581
01:05:15,020 --> 01:05:15,580
Um...

1582
01:05:15,580 --> 01:05:22,560
This was considered the best game they've ever made in the collection.

1583
01:05:22,700 --> 01:05:23,840
From what I've heard.

1584
01:05:24,080 --> 01:05:24,500
Okay.

1585
01:05:24,500 --> 01:05:26,220
I'm gonna make sure I like...

1586
01:05:26,220 --> 01:05:27,880
I like write this down.

1587
01:05:28,160 --> 01:05:28,740
So...

1588
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:37,380
My roommate Sonic 99 is considered one of the best games they've...

1589
01:05:37,380 --> 01:05:38,800
Uh...

1590
01:05:38,800 --> 01:05:40,180
They've ever...

1591
01:05:40,180 --> 01:05:40,920
Uh...

1592
01:05:40,920 --> 01:05:43,140
They've ever made in this collection.

1593
01:05:43,580 --> 01:05:44,280
Um...

1594
01:05:44,280 --> 01:05:45,320
I've never played this before.

1595
01:05:45,540 --> 01:05:49,420
But I assume that it's considered better than Sonic Movie Maker.

1596
01:05:49,700 --> 01:05:52,300
So if it's better than Sonic Movie Maker...

1597
01:05:52,300 --> 01:05:56,720
Then this might be true peak gaming at that point.

1598
01:05:56,860 --> 01:05:57,480
Uh...

1599
01:05:57,480 --> 01:05:59,060
This game was my childhood.

1600
01:05:59,080 --> 01:05:59,380
See?

1601
01:05:59,660 --> 01:06:00,420
Look at that!

1602
01:06:00,620 --> 01:06:08,920
This person seems like somebody that's played my roommate Sonic made in 1999 at least like a hundred times.

1603
01:06:13,560 --> 01:06:19,700
Also, back then they were like testing out the Oculus Rift back then in 1999.

1604
01:06:20,520 --> 01:06:21,120
So...

1605
01:06:22,760 --> 01:06:32,040
In 1999, the first Oculus Rift prototype was used to test out my roommate Sonic.

1606
01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:33,340
If you guys didn't know that.

1607
01:06:33,560 --> 01:06:34,560
It's a little fun fact.

1608
01:06:34,860 --> 01:06:35,620
A little...

1609
01:06:35,620 --> 01:06:37,640
A little small fun fact chat.

1610
01:06:43,040 --> 01:06:44,620
Guys, thank you for the super chat.

1611
01:06:44,740 --> 01:06:45,020
Thank you.

1612
01:06:45,020 --> 01:06:45,600
Thank you.

1613
01:06:46,660 --> 01:06:47,260
Um...

1614
01:06:47,260 --> 01:06:49,680
Thank you Director Doki for bringing me this game.

1615
01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:51,820
Thank you for giving Sonic Dreams Collection to a modern audience.

1616
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:54,460
God save us all.

1617
01:06:54,820 --> 01:06:56,460
Don't worry 90's kid.

1618
01:06:56,760 --> 01:06:58,560
I knew you guys want this.

1619
01:06:58,740 --> 01:06:58,860
Alright.

1620
01:07:00,100 --> 01:07:01,180
Oh, hey Sonic.

1621
01:07:01,640 --> 01:07:02,540
Hey there.

1622
01:07:03,260 --> 01:07:04,840
Oh, you and me?

1623
01:07:05,300 --> 01:07:05,880
Whoa!

1624
01:07:06,360 --> 01:07:09,560
Have you told your roommate how you feel about them?

1625
01:07:11,680 --> 01:07:12,360
Um...

1626
01:07:12,360 --> 01:07:13,880
Do I take the call?

1627
01:07:15,380 --> 01:07:16,060
Oh...

1628
01:07:16,060 --> 01:07:17,660
I don't believe you?

1629
01:07:19,900 --> 01:07:20,600
Okay.

1630
01:07:23,880 --> 01:07:24,820
Seize life.

1631
01:07:24,920 --> 01:07:26,420
Hold up one second.

1632
01:07:27,120 --> 01:07:28,520
Look out your window?

1633
01:07:30,500 --> 01:07:31,720
Oh shit!

1634
01:07:32,200 --> 01:07:33,720
Eggman my homie!

1635
01:07:35,180 --> 01:07:37,480
Just follow my lead.

1636
01:07:38,080 --> 01:07:38,780
Okay.

1637
01:07:39,080 --> 01:07:40,120
Okay Eggman.

1638
01:07:40,360 --> 01:07:41,520
What do I do?

1639
01:07:41,900 --> 01:07:43,080
What do you do bro?

1640
01:07:43,120 --> 01:07:44,420
Give him the tickles?

1641
01:07:54,860 --> 01:07:55,560
Okay.

1642
01:07:55,560 --> 01:07:55,820
Okay.

1643
01:07:55,820 --> 01:07:57,320
Is this like...

1644
01:07:57,320 --> 01:07:58,240
Okay.

1645
01:07:58,380 --> 01:07:58,920
Okay.

1646
01:07:58,980 --> 01:07:59,860
Is this...

1647
01:08:00,460 --> 01:08:01,920
We're watching hedgehogs.

1648
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:02,820
Naked hedgehogs.

1649
01:08:02,820 --> 01:08:03,620
Are we watching...

1650
01:08:03,620 --> 01:08:04,640
Are we watching porn?

1651
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:05,840
Sonic?

1652
01:08:05,980 --> 01:08:06,820
Is this...

1653
01:08:07,380 --> 01:08:07,500
What?

1654
01:08:10,300 --> 01:08:10,860
Oh...

1655
01:08:10,860 --> 01:08:12,720
Do I tickle you?

1656
01:08:14,020 --> 01:08:15,800
Am I tickling you right now?

1657
01:08:16,020 --> 01:08:16,800
Are you...

1658
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:19,900
Are you feeling a little ticklish, Sonic?

1659
01:08:21,880 --> 01:08:23,340
How do I tickle...

1660
01:08:29,940 --> 01:08:30,860
I'm clicking!

1661
01:08:32,820 --> 01:08:33,640
Instructions unclear!

1662
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:34,820
Oh...

1663
01:08:34,820 --> 01:08:35,280
Oh...

1664
01:08:35,280 --> 01:08:35,460
Oh...

1665
01:08:36,080 --> 01:08:36,820
I'm sorry.

1666
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:37,400
I'm sorry.

1667
01:08:37,460 --> 01:08:37,940
I should have asked...

1668
01:08:37,940 --> 01:08:38,860
I should have asked permission.

1669
01:08:39,080 --> 01:08:39,720
I'm so sorry.

1670
01:08:41,640 --> 01:08:42,760
I'm so sorry.

1671
01:08:43,980 --> 01:08:45,200
Come on, Sonic.

1672
01:08:45,320 --> 01:08:47,100
Don't you want to get tickled?

1673
01:08:47,640 --> 01:08:48,620
Yeah, you do.

1674
01:08:48,860 --> 01:08:49,120
Oh!

1675
01:08:51,760 --> 01:08:53,200
Go for the kill!

1676
01:08:53,260 --> 01:08:53,320
Oh!

1677
01:08:53,320 --> 01:08:54,340
What does that mean?

1678
01:08:55,080 --> 01:08:55,640
Oh!

1679
01:08:56,020 --> 01:08:57,400
But he doesn't like it!

1680
01:08:58,800 --> 01:09:00,400
Sonic, can I tickle you?

1681
01:09:01,780 --> 01:09:02,340
Okay.

1682
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:04,080
Oh!

1683
01:09:04,160 --> 01:09:04,420
Oh!

1684
01:09:10,600 --> 01:09:11,700
Sonic, please!

1685
01:09:13,420 --> 01:09:16,000
Please, you know you want the tickles!

1686
01:09:16,480 --> 01:09:17,220
What is this?

1687
01:09:17,560 --> 01:09:19,240
What is my life now?

1688
01:09:19,740 --> 01:09:21,740
What is...

1689
01:09:21,740 --> 01:09:22,680
Oh!

1690
01:09:22,920 --> 01:09:23,160
Oh!

1691
01:09:23,480 --> 01:09:23,680
Oh!

1692
01:09:23,680 --> 01:09:23,900
Oh!

1693
01:09:24,320 --> 01:09:24,720
Oh!

1694
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:25,240
Oh!

1695
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:28,240
I'm so sorry.

1696
01:09:28,240 --> 01:09:28,340
You are so happy.

1697
01:09:28,340 --> 01:09:29,660
Thank you for the super chat.

1698
01:09:29,780 --> 01:09:30,820
Thank you thank you.

1699
01:09:30,820 --> 01:09:31,300
Okay, I'm going to do it.

1700
01:09:31,300 --> 01:09:32,960
Give him the tickles, Doki.

1701
01:09:34,800 --> 01:09:37,200
Why is his feet like this?

1702
01:09:37,800 --> 01:09:39,340
It's supposed to be cute!

1703
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:40,560
Look at his feet!

1704
01:09:43,420 --> 01:09:44,880
Oh, my God.

1705
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:49,380
Where did the rings come from?

1706
01:09:50,920 --> 01:09:51,500
Oh.

1707
01:09:51,660 --> 01:09:52,100
Oh.

1708
01:09:54,080 --> 01:09:55,720
He's staring deep in the air.

1709
01:09:55,740 --> 01:09:56,220
Look at his eyes!

1710
01:09:58,660 --> 01:09:59,320
Big Ben!

1711
01:09:59,620 --> 01:10:02,000
Are you watching this you sick fuck?

1712
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:04,480
Oh...

1713
01:10:05,700 --> 01:10:06,180
Oh...

1714
01:10:07,680 --> 01:10:10,220
You taking it... No!

1715
01:10:11,620 --> 01:10:13,280
It's too far!

1716
01:10:13,740 --> 01:10:15,460
Too far!

1717
01:10:20,420 --> 01:10:21,460
Oh my god.

1718
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:24,060
It's me.

1719
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:26,180
Never go...

1720
01:10:26,180 --> 01:10:30,280
Never go full tickle.

1721
01:10:30,380 --> 01:10:33,200
Guys, here's a lesson to all of you.

1722
01:10:35,160 --> 01:10:36,960
Never go full tickle.

1723
01:10:42,760 --> 01:10:50,800
I hope this is what you wanted.

1724
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:55,260
I hope this is what you wanted.

1725
01:10:55,620 --> 01:10:56,080
Yay...

1726
01:10:58,540 --> 01:11:02,520
Guys, I realized why the music is playing all the time.

1727
01:11:03,080 --> 01:11:06,620
It's because I've been on the Sega network this entire time.

1728
01:11:06,980 --> 01:11:08,320
Bonus Siege Unlocked!

1729
01:11:08,340 --> 01:11:10,160
So that's why we're getting double the music.

1730
01:11:10,260 --> 01:11:11,060
I am so sorry.

1731
01:11:14,320 --> 01:11:15,540
Wait, I missed the password!

1732
01:11:15,740 --> 01:11:16,080
It's okay.

1733
01:11:17,780 --> 01:11:20,260
That's why we were having double the music.

1734
01:11:20,780 --> 01:11:21,440
That's why we were having double the music.

1735
01:11:21,440 --> 01:11:23,900
We had the Sega network on this entire time.

1736
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:26,280
So we were getting two music.

1737
01:11:26,580 --> 01:11:27,200
It's okay.

1738
01:11:27,440 --> 01:11:28,200
It works.

1739
01:11:28,360 --> 01:11:29,640
It worked in the end.

1740
01:11:29,800 --> 01:11:30,640
Alright, Sonic movie.

1741
01:11:30,760 --> 01:11:31,760
We got Bonus Siege!

1742
01:11:35,360 --> 01:11:36,560
Bonus Siege!

1743
01:11:36,720 --> 01:11:38,180
I thought it was intentional.

1744
01:11:39,200 --> 01:11:40,340
What's the Bonus DLC?

1745
01:11:41,660 --> 01:11:42,620
What is it?

1746
01:11:43,020 --> 01:11:43,620
Roommates?

1747
01:11:44,280 --> 01:11:45,960
Oh, we're just roommates guys.

1748
01:11:46,180 --> 01:11:46,660
Whoa!

1749
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:48,220
Wait, how do I get there?

1750
01:11:49,420 --> 01:11:50,480
We're just very...

1751
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:52,480
We're just like best friends.

1752
01:11:52,900 --> 01:11:53,880
Wait, how do I...

1753
01:11:55,280 --> 01:11:55,880
Grab...

1754
01:11:55,880 --> 01:11:57,200
How do I grab this?

1755
01:11:58,480 --> 01:11:59,660
Give me the camera.

1756
01:12:00,920 --> 01:12:02,120
Give me the camera.

1757
01:12:03,560 --> 01:12:04,820
I want the camera!

1758
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:09,260
How do I grab the camera?

1759
01:12:11,700 --> 01:12:12,840
But I want...

1760
01:12:12,840 --> 01:12:13,060
Whoa!

1761
01:12:13,740 --> 01:12:15,580
I want to film things!

1762
01:12:16,740 --> 01:12:18,120
I want to film things!

1763
01:12:18,120 --> 01:12:18,180
I want to film things!

1764
01:12:18,180 --> 01:12:18,200
I want to film things!

1765
01:12:21,540 --> 01:12:23,180
Oh my god, they're looking at me.

1766
01:12:24,200 --> 01:12:25,040
How do I...

1767
01:12:26,480 --> 01:12:27,860
How do I get the camera?

1768
01:12:28,760 --> 01:12:29,260
Sonic!

1769
01:12:31,740 --> 01:12:32,740
What do I do?

1770
01:12:33,780 --> 01:12:35,220
Do I just...

1771
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:37,060
Okay.

1772
01:12:37,400 --> 01:12:39,020
We'll use this and push it.

1773
01:12:42,160 --> 01:12:42,660
Oh!

1774
01:12:43,480 --> 01:12:44,880
Your entire head!

1775
01:12:45,300 --> 01:12:45,800
Okay.

1776
01:12:46,300 --> 01:12:47,980
Alright, I figured it out guys.

1777
01:12:49,360 --> 01:12:49,760
Oh!

1778
01:12:50,280 --> 01:12:50,940
Wait, what?

1779
01:12:52,140 --> 01:12:52,920
Give me the head.

1780
01:12:53,620 --> 01:12:54,440
Okay, here you go.

1781
01:12:54,900 --> 01:12:55,300
Alright.

1782
01:12:57,300 --> 01:12:58,300
I'm holding it...

1783
01:12:58,300 --> 01:12:59,480
I'm pulling it back to me.

1784
01:13:00,180 --> 01:13:01,400
I'm pulling it back.

1785
01:13:02,960 --> 01:13:03,360
Yes!

1786
01:13:03,400 --> 01:13:03,720
Alright.

1787
01:13:03,960 --> 01:13:04,660
There we go.

1788
01:13:05,340 --> 01:13:05,740
Alright.

1789
01:13:06,480 --> 01:13:06,880
Nice.

1790
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:08,620
Wait, there's another egg!

1791
01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:12,500
There's another egg over there!

1792
01:13:13,680 --> 01:13:14,660
Wait, but like...

1793
01:13:14,660 --> 01:13:15,900
How do we make this a story?

1794
01:13:15,980 --> 01:13:17,340
You're not going to be tickling anymore!

1795
01:13:18,020 --> 01:13:19,000
You're not...

1796
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:20,200
You're not...

1797
01:13:22,600 --> 01:13:24,080
How is this a story?

1798
01:13:24,200 --> 01:13:25,900
You're not tickling anymore!

1799
01:13:27,360 --> 01:13:27,960
Alright.

1800
01:13:28,260 --> 01:13:28,580
Oh.

1801
01:13:29,340 --> 01:13:30,280
Yeah, this...

1802
01:13:30,280 --> 01:13:31,380
This feels right.

1803
01:13:35,980 --> 01:13:36,580
This...

1804
01:13:36,580 --> 01:13:38,260
This feels right.

1805
01:13:38,900 --> 01:13:39,500
Okay.

1806
01:13:42,720 --> 01:13:44,140
Oh my god, I can play Snake!

1807
01:13:44,300 --> 01:13:45,660
Okay, this is going to be the...

1808
01:13:45,660 --> 01:13:46,680
This...

1809
01:13:46,680 --> 01:13:48,780
This is the movie!

1810
01:13:48,780 --> 01:13:48,880
Oh!

1811
01:13:48,880 --> 01:13:54,660
Guys, guys, I'm gonna be streaming... Hello everybody, my name is Dokibird.

1812
01:13:54,720 --> 01:13:59,360
And today, we're gonna be playing Snake in Sonic Dreams Collection.

1813
01:14:00,140 --> 01:14:03,300
First off, I broke the key... okay, here we go.

1814
01:14:03,460 --> 01:14:04,040
Alright.

1815
01:14:05,460 --> 01:14:06,040
Nice.

1816
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:07,720
There we go.

1817
01:14:08,920 --> 01:14:10,100
Look at me.

1818
01:14:10,420 --> 01:14:13,440
This is my 2007 Let's Play.

1819
01:14:13,500 --> 01:14:14,100
You know what?

1820
01:14:14,140 --> 01:14:14,640
That's great.

1821
01:14:14,860 --> 01:14:15,980
I think that's good.

1822
01:14:16,140 --> 01:14:17,140
I think that's a good film.

1823
01:14:24,860 --> 01:14:25,760
Oh my god!

1824
01:14:26,160 --> 01:14:28,380
Good Special Effects Award!

1825
01:14:28,760 --> 01:14:29,400
Let's go!

1826
01:14:30,300 --> 01:14:35,980
Do you guys like my 2007 Let's Play video?

1827
01:14:37,460 --> 01:14:38,120
Right here.

1828
01:14:38,180 --> 01:14:38,900
Sorry, 1999.

1829
01:14:39,820 --> 01:14:40,340
1998!

1830
01:14:40,480 --> 01:14:41,340
I forgot, sorry.

1831
01:14:41,400 --> 01:14:42,960
Sonic Movie Maker came out in 1998.

1832
01:14:43,260 --> 01:14:47,780
Did you guys like my 1998... 1998...

1833
01:14:49,620 --> 01:14:51,640
Sonic Let's Play video, guys?

1834
01:14:51,960 --> 01:14:52,520
Nice.

1835
01:14:52,580 --> 01:14:54,160
Okay, Rap Party...

1836
01:14:56,020 --> 01:14:57,240
Is this the same party?

1837
01:14:58,800 --> 01:15:00,320
The first Let's Play.

1838
01:15:00,740 --> 01:15:03,940
I basically made the first Let's Play.

1839
01:15:06,660 --> 01:15:08,260
It takes a village!

1840
01:15:09,500 --> 01:15:11,320
Alright, we did it.

1841
01:15:12,400 --> 01:15:16,520
Alright, now... now we should be able to down...

1842
01:15:17,780 --> 01:15:22,940
Now we should be able to make my Sonic OC.

1843
01:15:23,380 --> 01:15:29,540
Okay, I saved... somebody gave me the username and password.

1844
01:15:29,800 --> 01:15:30,860
Do not worry.

1845
01:15:31,280 --> 01:15:33,700
Someone paid $5 for this.

1846
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:41,720
Someone paid $5, so we got this.

1847
01:15:42,040 --> 01:15:43,840
Alright, log in.

1848
01:15:44,180 --> 01:15:45,920
Allow access, please.

1849
01:15:45,920 --> 01:15:47,860
I'm launching the servers.

1850
01:15:48,240 --> 01:15:48,880
Whoa!

1851
01:15:50,620 --> 01:15:53,020
Can't see all this happening right now.

1852
01:15:53,440 --> 01:15:55,620
But a lot of stuff is happening.

1853
01:15:57,380 --> 01:15:58,020
Whoa!

1854
01:15:58,020 --> 01:15:59,540
Downloading so many things!

1855
01:15:59,640 --> 01:16:00,260
You hear that?

1856
01:16:01,500 --> 01:16:03,460
That's me downloading stuff right now.

1857
01:16:08,120 --> 01:16:14,540
10, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80!

1858
01:16:15,480 --> 01:16:15,960
90!

1859
01:16:17,960 --> 01:16:18,440
100!

1860
01:16:18,840 --> 01:16:19,720
Do I have it?

1861
01:16:20,340 --> 01:16:21,760

1862
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:23,600
Warning.

1863
01:16:23,880 --> 01:16:25,580
It's running at full speed.

1864
01:16:26,260 --> 01:16:27,040
Is that it?

1865
01:16:27,220 --> 01:16:28,020
That got it to work?

1866
01:16:29,680 --> 01:16:31,980
Can I... can I get in now?

1867
01:16:33,800 --> 01:16:34,500
Can I...

1868
01:16:35,420 --> 01:16:36,820
Message of the day.

1869
01:16:38,620 --> 01:16:40,240
March 15th, 1998.

1870
01:16:41,940 --> 01:16:43,940
Who... I don't even want to say this name out loud.

1871
01:16:44,040 --> 01:16:44,320
I don't...

1872
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:47,120
Some guy...

1873
01:16:47,120 --> 01:16:49,000
That's what it says.

1874
01:16:49,240 --> 01:16:50,980
Thank you for the super chat.

1875
01:16:51,180 --> 01:16:51,620
Thank you.

1876
01:16:51,640 --> 01:16:52,320
Thank you.

1877
01:16:52,660 --> 01:16:55,520
Alright, let me upload my OC again.

1878
01:16:55,700 --> 01:16:56,680
We'll test it out.

1879
01:16:56,800 --> 01:16:58,840
We'll test it out by uploading my OC.

1880
01:16:59,520 --> 01:17:00,080
Alright.

1881
01:17:00,340 --> 01:17:01,020
I still...

1882
01:17:01,020 --> 01:17:01,480
Do we still...

1883
01:17:01,480 --> 01:17:02,440
We still have her!

1884
01:17:02,980 --> 01:17:04,360
Oh my god.

1885
01:17:04,500 --> 01:17:05,720
She's still there.

1886
01:17:06,120 --> 01:17:07,520
Wait, I think it got uploaded!

1887
01:17:08,040 --> 01:17:08,680
It is!

1888
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:09,700
Oh my god.

1889
01:17:09,740 --> 01:17:10,200
We have...

1890
01:17:10,200 --> 01:17:11,700
We have sexy outfit.

1891
01:17:12,720 --> 01:17:13,840
We have...

1892
01:17:13,840 --> 01:17:16,020
We have sexy outfit.

1893
01:17:16,240 --> 01:17:17,520
Oh my god.

1894
01:17:17,580 --> 01:17:18,400
This is it.

1895
01:17:18,900 --> 01:17:19,820
We're in.

1896
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:21,320
Alright.

1897
01:17:21,440 --> 01:17:22,520
The big finale.

1898
01:17:22,840 --> 01:17:23,840
The unreleased...

1899
01:17:25,660 --> 01:17:27,020
The unreleased...

1900
01:17:27,020 --> 01:17:28,840
Sonic MMORPG.

1901
01:17:32,340 --> 01:17:34,400
Wait, what do you mean no character data?

1902
01:17:35,320 --> 01:17:36,560
What do you mean?

1903
01:17:37,060 --> 01:17:42,220
What about sexy outfit?

1904
01:17:43,840 --> 01:17:44,040
Heh heh.

1905
01:17:45,980 --> 01:17:48,360
She's real to me.

1906
01:17:48,840 --> 01:17:50,280
She's real.

1907
01:17:51,200 --> 01:17:52,520
Heh heh heh.

1908
01:17:54,160 --> 01:17:55,780
You need the code?

1909
01:17:56,060 --> 01:17:57,080
Make another?

1910
01:17:57,420 --> 01:17:58,240
I have to...

1911
01:17:58,240 --> 01:18:00,180
I have to upload my OC.

1912
01:18:00,560 --> 01:18:01,900
But like, how?

1913
01:18:02,200 --> 01:18:03,800
It's not there anymore.

1914
01:18:04,180 --> 01:18:05,480
It's not there.

1915
01:18:05,880 --> 01:18:06,600
Heh heh heh.

1916
01:18:07,760 --> 01:18:09,740
Where did the upload go?

1917
01:18:10,520 --> 01:18:11,680
Where did it go?

1918
01:18:12,520 --> 01:18:13,520
Heh heh heh.

1919
01:18:14,260 --> 01:18:15,740
Oh, I just need to take a screenshot.

1920
01:18:15,880 --> 01:18:16,060
Okay.

1921
01:18:16,460 --> 01:18:16,860
Okay.

1922
01:18:16,980 --> 01:18:17,920
I almost forgot.

1923
01:18:18,040 --> 01:18:18,340
Okay.

1924
01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:19,640
Where's the back?

1925
01:18:22,160 --> 01:18:22,900
Ooh, okay.

1926
01:18:22,960 --> 01:18:23,600
A little bit...

1927
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:25,820
The leg kicking out right here.

1928
01:18:26,100 --> 01:18:27,140
And then, boom.

1929
01:18:28,220 --> 01:18:29,000
There it is!

1930
01:18:29,300 --> 01:18:30,460
Okay, I'm gonna upload it.

1931
01:18:30,500 --> 01:18:32,880
I'm really worried, so I'm gonna unhide that real fast.

1932
01:18:33,520 --> 01:18:34,980
I'm gonna hide that real fast.

1933
01:18:35,360 --> 01:18:36,360
Oh, it just says this.

1934
01:18:38,660 --> 01:18:39,240
Upload success!

1935
01:18:40,500 --> 01:18:41,220
There we go.

1936
01:18:42,100 --> 01:18:42,700
Yay!

1937
01:18:44,260 --> 01:18:45,140
Sexy outfit!

1938
01:18:45,220 --> 01:18:45,600
Let's go!

1939
01:18:46,020 --> 01:18:46,560
Alright.

1940
01:18:46,660 --> 01:18:48,080
Now we have our character.

1941
01:18:49,340 --> 01:18:50,820
Now we have our character.

1942
01:18:51,080 --> 01:18:51,440
Now we have our character.

1943
01:18:52,460 --> 01:18:53,340
Here we go.

1944
01:18:54,320 --> 01:18:55,280
Eggman origin.

1945
01:18:56,820 --> 01:18:58,260
What happened to your body?

1946
01:18:58,340 --> 01:19:00,400
What happened to your body?

1947
01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:01,220
Your body!

1948
01:19:02,340 --> 01:19:05,100
How can you be sexy without a body?

1949
01:19:05,660 --> 01:19:07,120
How can you be sexy without a body?

1950
01:19:07,120 --> 01:19:07,460
How can you be sexy without a body?

1951
01:19:10,580 --> 01:19:11,920
Alright, log in.

1952
01:19:12,340 --> 01:19:13,140
Where am I?

1953
01:19:13,260 --> 01:19:14,620
Is this me?

1954
01:19:15,380 --> 01:19:15,960
It's me.

1955
01:19:16,700 --> 01:19:17,920
Where can me go?

1956
01:19:19,200 --> 01:19:20,600
What's going on?

1957
01:19:21,560 --> 01:19:22,300
Hello?

1958
01:19:23,100 --> 01:19:24,220
Hello there!

1959
01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:27,140
Hello!

1960
01:19:28,060 --> 01:19:29,160
Sexy legs!

1961
01:19:29,300 --> 01:19:30,660
Even better!

1962
01:19:31,300 --> 01:19:33,120
But where's my butt?

1963
01:19:34,040 --> 01:19:34,780
Hello?

1964
01:19:35,420 --> 01:19:37,140
What are you supposed to do?

1965
01:19:37,680 --> 01:19:38,420
Eggman?

1966
01:19:39,780 --> 01:19:41,000
Where do I go?

1967
01:19:42,420 --> 01:19:43,240
Where do I go?

1968
01:19:43,260 --> 01:19:44,560
Where's sexy outfit gonna go?

1969
01:19:45,480 --> 01:19:46,320
Am I...

1970
01:19:47,020 --> 01:19:48,120
Am I going the right way?

1971
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,140
Guys, anyone else create an account?

1972
01:19:51,400 --> 01:19:52,920
In Eggman origins?

1973
01:19:53,900 --> 01:19:55,560
Did anyone else?

1974
01:19:58,940 --> 01:20:01,040
Did anyone else create an account?

1975
01:20:01,620 --> 01:20:02,640
Did anyone else create an account?

1976
01:20:02,640 --> 01:20:04,980
Did anyone else create an account?

1977
01:20:05,700 --> 01:20:08,200
Sure that you guys know where to go, right?

1978
01:20:09,080 --> 01:20:09,380
Sure that you guys know where to go, right?

1979
01:20:10,780 --> 01:20:12,880
I like how it sounds like, I got banned.

1980
01:20:14,380 --> 01:20:16,520
Sorry, we can't help you.

1981
01:20:16,940 --> 01:20:18,120
Wait, let me...

1982
01:20:18,120 --> 01:20:19,920
I'm gonna turn off the...

1983
01:20:20,600 --> 01:20:21,180
Sega net.

1984
01:20:23,480 --> 01:20:25,100
Surely somebody's on...

1985
01:20:25,100 --> 01:20:27,460
Where are all my friends at?

1986
01:20:28,660 --> 01:20:29,640
Where are all my friends at?

1987
01:20:29,640 --> 01:20:31,180
The shuttle loop is an enigma.

1988
01:20:31,620 --> 01:20:33,300
I'm a hundred years old.

1989
01:20:33,620 --> 01:20:34,540
Oh, okay.

1990
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:35,980
Where am I?

1991
01:20:37,480 --> 01:20:38,120
Where...

1992
01:20:39,200 --> 01:20:40,280
Where am I?

1993
01:20:43,100 --> 01:20:44,040
Where do I go?

1994
01:20:45,200 --> 01:20:45,640
Where do I go?

1995
01:20:45,640 --> 01:20:45,660
Oh...

1996
01:20:46,200 --> 01:20:46,640
Where...

1997
01:20:46,640 --> 01:20:47,880
Where do I go?

1998
01:20:49,760 --> 01:20:50,200
Where...

1999
01:20:51,220 --> 01:20:53,100
Where do I go, Mr. Eggie?

2000
01:20:54,420 --> 01:20:55,800
Mr. Eggie, I'm lost!

2001
01:20:58,200 --> 01:20:59,080
I'm lost!

2002
01:20:59,880 --> 01:21:00,320
I'm lost!

2003
01:21:00,580 --> 01:21:01,020
Okay.

2004
01:21:01,520 --> 01:21:02,580
Maybe it's this way.

2005
01:21:03,260 --> 01:21:04,600
It has to be this way.

2006
01:21:04,640 --> 01:21:05,540
Where else can we go?

2007
01:21:08,160 --> 01:21:09,160
Is it this way?

2008
01:21:09,300 --> 01:21:10,260
Oh, there's another Mr. Eggie!

2009
01:21:10,280 --> 01:21:10,840
Oh!

2010
01:21:11,620 --> 01:21:12,980
Get me out of the void!

2011
01:21:13,200 --> 01:21:14,740
Now we're both lost.

2012
01:21:14,960 --> 01:21:15,820
Pessimistic Egg.

2013
01:21:16,100 --> 01:21:17,340
We can't be lost!

2014
01:21:17,680 --> 01:21:19,200
We just have to go up!

2015
01:21:19,420 --> 01:21:23,000
The never-ending expanse is kind of scary.

2016
01:21:23,860 --> 01:21:24,020
The never-ending expanse is kind of scary.

2017
01:21:24,340 --> 01:21:25,300
Is that...

2018
01:21:26,080 --> 01:21:27,340
Am I going the right way?

2019
01:21:29,420 --> 01:21:30,320
Is this it?

2020
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:33,740
Is this a new Spore sequel?

2021
01:21:35,180 --> 01:21:38,920
No, Spore is the sequel to Eggman Origins, guys.

2022
01:21:38,980 --> 01:21:39,240
Spore is the sequel to Eggman Origins, guys.

2023
01:21:41,320 --> 01:21:43,020
Thank you for the super chat.

2024
01:21:43,100 --> 01:21:44,380
Where am I?

2025
01:21:45,420 --> 01:21:47,100
Where the fuck am I?

2026
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:52,040
Where am I?

2027
01:21:52,280 --> 01:21:52,900
Where am I?

2028
01:21:53,600 --> 01:21:54,900
Oh, that's the wall!

2029
01:21:55,980 --> 01:22:01,260
I think the worst part is that I can't see anything.

2030
01:22:01,760 --> 01:22:03,580
I can't see anything.

2031
01:22:07,160 --> 01:22:09,920
I can't see anything.

2032
01:22:20,220 --> 01:22:32,780
Oh, I can't see!

2033
01:22:32,780 --> 01:22:33,680
Oh, it was on my leg!

2034
01:22:33,720 --> 01:22:33,740
Oh, no!

2035
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:37,660
I'm so tired!

2036
01:22:37,740 --> 01:22:39,020
I need to get up!

2037
01:22:39,100 --> 01:22:39,900
And someone get me out!

2038
01:22:39,900 --> 01:22:42,180
No wonder they cancelled.

2039
01:22:42,460 --> 01:22:43,680
Oh god, oh god.

2040
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,700
This is like a dark journey into limbo.

2041
01:22:46,820 --> 01:22:48,800
The realm between heaven and hell.

2042
01:22:48,980 --> 01:22:51,480
A purgatory for Sonic fans.

2043
01:22:51,920 --> 01:22:53,620
Boynton, thank you for the super chat.

2044
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:54,740
Thank you, thank you.

2045
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:56,060
Hit towards your camera?

2046
01:22:56,240 --> 01:22:57,080
Okay, you're right.

2047
01:22:57,240 --> 01:22:57,880
You're right.

2048
01:22:58,560 --> 01:23:00,640
I'll eventually find my way.

2049
01:23:01,780 --> 01:23:03,900
If I keep walking backwards...

2050
01:23:04,480 --> 01:23:06,800
There has to be another egg somewhere!

2051
01:23:09,900 --> 01:23:13,180
This is what my sleep paralysis even looks like.

2052
01:23:14,720 --> 01:23:16,020
We're in Canada.

2053
01:23:16,400 --> 01:23:17,660
Oh my god.

2054
01:23:19,200 --> 01:23:21,040
Bro, this map is huge!

2055
01:23:22,620 --> 01:23:24,600
This is an MMORPG!

2056
01:23:25,540 --> 01:23:29,800
Oh my god, Final Fantasy wishes it can be just this game.

2057
01:23:31,740 --> 01:23:33,060
Oh my god, another egg!

2058
01:23:33,300 --> 01:23:34,140
Another egg!

2059
01:23:34,540 --> 01:23:35,100
Friend?

2060
01:23:36,420 --> 01:23:37,060
Friend!

2061
01:23:38,060 --> 01:23:38,700
Friend!

2062
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:39,780
Where am I?

2063
01:23:39,800 --> 01:23:39,880
Friend!

2064
01:23:39,900 --> 01:23:40,240
Friend!

2065
01:23:41,380 --> 01:23:41,820
Friend!

2066
01:23:43,180 --> 01:23:45,900
I tried to take a nap in the shade, but I can't sleep.

2067
01:23:46,880 --> 01:23:47,320
Friend!

2068
01:23:48,680 --> 01:23:50,040
Where am I, friend?

2069
01:23:50,620 --> 01:23:51,860
Wait, do I follow the shadow?

2070
01:23:52,480 --> 01:23:54,300
Maybe if I follow the shadow...

2071
01:23:54,300 --> 01:23:55,340
Wait, click the cloud.

2072
01:23:55,580 --> 01:23:56,400
What's the cloud?

2073
01:23:57,440 --> 01:23:58,200
What's the cloud?

2074
01:23:58,240 --> 01:23:59,020
Where did the cloud go?

2075
01:24:04,400 --> 01:24:05,380
Oh, what's that?

2076
01:24:06,260 --> 01:24:07,180
The fuck is that?

2077
01:24:11,930 --> 01:24:13,870
I feed Mr. Egg!

2078
01:24:14,670 --> 01:24:16,450
Oh my god, I know now!

2079
01:24:16,790 --> 01:24:17,790
I know now!

2080
01:24:18,510 --> 01:24:19,470
Don't worry!

2081
01:24:19,890 --> 01:24:21,130
Don't worry, Eggman!

2082
01:24:22,610 --> 01:24:24,630
I'm gonna make you big and strong!

2083
01:24:27,830 --> 01:24:29,930
Oh my god, I know now!

2084
01:24:31,110 --> 01:24:32,190
I know now!

2085
01:24:32,610 --> 01:24:33,670
The objective!

2086
01:24:34,390 --> 01:24:36,130
My purpose in life!

2087
01:24:36,950 --> 01:24:38,430
Alright, I figured it out.

2088
01:24:38,430 --> 01:24:40,390
I figured it out.

2089
01:24:40,810 --> 01:24:43,370
Don't worry, now I know why I'm all eggs!

2090
01:24:43,630 --> 01:24:45,030
Now I know why!

2091
01:24:48,250 --> 01:24:48,890
Iggy!

2092
01:24:49,390 --> 01:24:50,710
Eggman, where are you?

2093
01:24:52,150 --> 01:24:53,630
What the fuck?

2094
01:24:54,050 --> 01:24:55,250
What the fuck?

2095
01:24:56,630 --> 01:24:57,770
Oh my god!

2096
01:25:01,170 --> 01:25:03,150
Here you go, child.

2097
01:25:06,630 --> 01:25:08,470
Oh, he's turning big!

2098
01:25:11,150 --> 01:25:13,470
He's a big boy now!

2099
01:25:15,210 --> 01:25:16,590
Karin, thank you for the super chat!

2100
01:25:16,690 --> 01:25:16,990
Thank you!

2101
01:25:17,330 --> 01:25:20,670
I don't think my dreams are gonna be pleasant tonight.

2102
01:25:20,990 --> 01:25:22,170
What are you guys talking about?

2103
01:25:23,850 --> 01:25:25,130
What are you guys talking about?

2104
01:25:25,950 --> 01:25:26,970
We're talking about...

2105
01:25:26,970 --> 01:25:28,250
Don't you wanna tickle Sonic?

2106
01:25:29,310 --> 01:25:31,450
Don't you wanna tickle him?

2107
01:25:31,770 --> 01:25:32,830
I'm a little lost.

2108
01:25:32,830 --> 01:25:35,790
Is this where my child is?

2109
01:25:36,030 --> 01:25:36,570
Here we go.

2110
01:25:37,370 --> 01:25:40,690
Become big and strong for sexy outfit!

2111
01:25:42,230 --> 01:25:42,790
Whoa!

2112
01:25:42,790 --> 01:25:43,350
Okay!

2113
01:25:43,830 --> 01:25:46,370
She's definitely becoming big and strong.

2114
01:25:47,210 --> 01:25:48,850
I wonder if there's any clouds in the back.

2115
01:25:49,350 --> 01:25:50,810
Are there any clouds in the back?

2116
01:25:51,170 --> 01:25:52,670
Or is it all forward?

2117
01:25:53,230 --> 01:25:56,030
This is the real DokiBree simulator.

2118
01:25:59,490 --> 01:26:00,530
What are you going to say?

2119
01:26:01,350 --> 01:26:04,650
Treat an egg baby good to get an award.

2120
01:26:08,170 --> 01:26:09,450
Nyle, thank you for the super chat!

2121
01:26:09,570 --> 01:26:09,790
Thank you!

2122
01:26:10,170 --> 01:26:12,470
This game was made before yellow paint guides.

2123
01:26:12,650 --> 01:26:14,550
And it is a masterpiece for it.

2124
01:26:14,650 --> 01:26:15,990
Thank you for the super chat!

2125
01:26:16,130 --> 01:26:16,530
Thank you!

2126
01:26:17,610 --> 01:26:18,870
We are the worms!

2127
01:26:19,590 --> 01:26:21,290
We are the worms!

2128
01:26:22,450 --> 01:26:22,930
Guys!

2129
01:26:23,730 --> 01:26:25,130
We are the worms!

2130
01:26:26,530 --> 01:26:28,390
It's just the void!

2131
01:26:28,650 --> 01:26:28,890
Oh!

2132
01:26:28,910 --> 01:26:29,470
There's a worm!

2133
01:26:29,610 --> 01:26:30,510
There's a worm right there!

2134
01:26:31,410 --> 01:26:32,010
Worm!

2135
01:26:34,790 --> 01:26:35,390
Worm!

2136
01:26:37,030 --> 01:26:39,330
I need to feed my baby egg!

2137
01:26:40,490 --> 01:26:41,950
Get over here worm!

2138
01:26:43,170 --> 01:26:43,670
Boop!

2139
01:26:43,770 --> 01:26:43,870
Boop!

2140
01:26:43,950 --> 01:26:44,550
Alright.

2141
01:26:44,710 --> 01:26:45,030
Nice.

2142
01:26:45,350 --> 01:26:45,730
Alright.

2143
01:26:45,770 --> 01:26:47,070
Back to Mr. Egg Man.

2144
01:26:47,590 --> 01:26:49,070
I wish I could run.

2145
01:26:49,290 --> 01:26:51,350
I wish I could run faster.

2146
01:26:55,830 --> 01:26:59,350
This is the dragoons origin story.

2147
01:26:59,910 --> 01:27:00,510
This is the dragoons origin story.

2148
01:27:03,190 --> 01:27:03,710
Sorry.

2149
01:27:03,770 --> 01:27:04,690
Thank you for the super chat.

2150
01:27:04,770 --> 01:27:05,130
Magenta super!

2151
01:27:05,530 --> 01:27:05,910
Thank you!

2152
01:27:06,570 --> 01:27:08,270
Dear Miss DokiBird.

2153
01:27:08,370 --> 01:27:10,470
My therapist will be hearing from this.

2154
01:27:10,730 --> 01:27:11,170
What?

2155
01:27:11,230 --> 01:27:12,310
Because you had a great time?

2156
01:27:13,410 --> 01:27:16,250
Because you had a great time?

2157
01:27:16,470 --> 01:27:17,750
Because you had a great time?

2158
01:27:17,750 --> 01:27:18,170
I did.

2159
01:27:18,870 --> 01:27:19,390
Alright.

2160
01:27:19,430 --> 01:27:20,250
Here we go.

2161
01:27:20,450 --> 01:27:20,870
This is all?

2162
01:27:21,230 --> 01:27:22,470
Do you need more worms?

2163
01:27:22,850 --> 01:27:24,470
Are you big and strong now?

2164
01:27:25,730 --> 01:27:26,250
Oh!

2165
01:27:26,970 --> 01:27:28,030
Do we need more?

2166
01:27:28,030 --> 01:27:30,230
Where am I going to get more?

2167
01:27:30,230 --> 01:27:31,130
Where am I going to find more worms?

2168
01:27:31,730 --> 01:27:34,150
Where am I going to get more worms?

2169
01:27:34,550 --> 01:27:37,170
You have so many worms!

2170
01:27:37,330 --> 01:27:38,140
You have so many worms!

2171
01:27:38,650 --> 01:27:40,150
I was trying to think of what I should get.

2172
01:27:40,150 --> 01:27:40,350
Oh yes!

2173
01:27:40,350 --> 01:27:40,510
There is more!

2174
01:27:41,860 --> 01:27:45,310
I'm just an ordinary working bird mom!

2175
01:27:46,890 --> 01:27:47,630
I'm just an ordinary working bird mom!

2176
01:27:51,770 --> 01:27:55,050
Where else can I find more worms?

2177
01:27:58,530 --> 01:27:59,450
Okay, here we go.

2178
01:27:59,510 --> 01:28:00,130
There's another worm.

2179
01:28:00,490 --> 01:28:01,510
There's another worm.

2180
01:28:04,030 --> 01:28:04,750
Alright, here.

2181
01:28:05,270 --> 01:28:05,990
Is that it?

2182
01:28:06,470 --> 01:28:07,450
How much more?

2183
01:28:08,530 --> 01:28:10,070
How much more do you want?

2184
01:28:12,170 --> 01:28:13,890
Hector, thank you for the super chat.

2185
01:28:13,970 --> 01:28:14,750
Thank you, thank you.

2186
01:28:15,310 --> 01:28:17,050
Psychologist, all dreams have meaning.

2187
01:28:17,370 --> 01:28:18,370
My dreams.

2188
01:28:18,750 --> 01:28:20,170
Thank you for the super chat.

2189
01:28:20,230 --> 01:28:21,250
Thank you, thank you.

2190
01:28:25,130 --> 01:28:26,890
Oh my god, where did he go?

2191
01:28:27,130 --> 01:28:27,970
Am I going the right way?

2192
01:28:28,010 --> 01:28:28,390
Oh, it's this way.

2193
01:28:28,490 --> 01:28:28,830
Okay.

2194
01:28:29,210 --> 01:28:30,230
This is where he is.

2195
01:28:31,170 --> 01:28:31,990
Alright, here we go.

2196
01:28:33,070 --> 01:28:33,770
Is this it?

2197
01:28:34,970 --> 01:28:36,530
Are you good now?

2198
01:28:38,230 --> 01:28:39,030
Are you full?

2199
01:28:40,070 --> 01:28:40,470
More?

2200
01:28:43,150 --> 01:28:44,050
Do you want...

2201
01:28:44,490 --> 01:28:45,530
Do you want more?

2202
01:28:48,830 --> 01:28:50,350
Where am I gonna find more?

2203
01:28:51,030 --> 01:28:52,210
I defeated six?

2204
01:28:52,950 --> 01:28:54,150
How many did I get?

2205
01:28:55,170 --> 01:28:57,130
Wait, how many did I get?

2206
01:28:57,430 --> 01:28:58,910
Oh my god, I've lost count.

2207
01:28:59,530 --> 01:29:00,550
I've lost count.

2208
01:29:01,170 --> 01:29:03,170
How much more do I need?

2209
01:29:06,450 --> 01:29:07,890
Thank you for the super chat.

2210
01:29:07,970 --> 01:29:08,890
Thank you, thank you.

2211
01:29:09,110 --> 01:29:09,890
Just join.

2212
01:29:10,150 --> 01:29:11,290
I feel like I need it.

2213
01:29:11,450 --> 01:29:12,530
I have found four?

2214
01:29:13,090 --> 01:29:14,750
Oh my god, this is...

2215
01:29:15,590 --> 01:29:16,570
This is stupid.

2216
01:29:16,830 --> 01:29:17,750
This is stupid.

2217
01:29:18,030 --> 01:29:20,190
Why can't the worms just come to me?

2218
01:29:20,510 --> 01:29:20,990
There's one.

2219
01:29:21,090 --> 01:29:21,830
There's one right here.

2220
01:29:21,970 --> 01:29:22,870
There's one right here.

2221
01:29:22,990 --> 01:29:23,610
Oh my god.

2222
01:29:23,610 --> 01:29:25,070
Oh my god, there's one here.

2223
01:29:25,390 --> 01:29:26,070
Okay.

2224
01:29:26,190 --> 01:29:27,190
Don't worry, we got this.

2225
01:29:27,690 --> 01:29:28,730
We got this.

2226
01:29:28,790 --> 01:29:29,750
Don't worry, Eggman.

2227
01:29:30,290 --> 01:29:32,510
Mama's coming back with another worm.

2228
01:29:33,970 --> 01:29:36,630
Child care is not stupid.

2229
01:29:41,810 --> 01:29:50,510
Look, you don't understand how hard it is to be a single bird mom.

2230
01:29:50,510 --> 01:29:54,170
You don't know the hard life it is.

2231
01:29:58,180 --> 01:30:00,550
Why are you... Why are you trying to find...

2232
01:30:00,550 --> 01:30:02,350
Going out there in the void.

2233
01:30:02,690 --> 01:30:05,690
Trying to find six fucking worms.

2234
01:30:06,050 --> 01:30:08,050
For your demanding egg child.

2235
01:30:08,890 --> 01:30:09,930
There you go.

2236
01:30:10,510 --> 01:30:11,290
One more.

2237
01:30:11,650 --> 01:30:13,270
It takes a village.

2238
01:30:13,630 --> 01:30:14,330
Exactly.

2239
01:30:14,630 --> 01:30:16,590
It takes a fucking village.

2240
01:30:17,470 --> 01:30:18,990
Oh my god.

2241
01:30:20,150 --> 01:30:25,390
My Sonic OC was supposed to be in the void to be sexy.

2242
01:30:26,650 --> 01:30:28,610
Not to find worms.

2243
01:30:35,840 --> 01:30:36,650
Right side.

2244
01:30:36,770 --> 01:30:37,150
Okay.

2245
01:30:37,350 --> 01:30:38,390
To the right.

2246
01:30:38,530 --> 01:30:39,190
To the right.

2247
01:30:39,740 --> 01:30:40,970
Here I go.

2248
01:30:41,760 --> 01:30:43,470
Where is this worm?

2249
01:30:44,010 --> 01:30:45,930
Now she's all...

2250
01:30:48,990 --> 01:30:49,570
Oh, there it is.

2251
01:30:49,650 --> 01:30:50,430
There's the last one.

2252
01:30:50,930 --> 01:30:51,690
There you are.

2253
01:30:52,670 --> 01:30:53,630
I'm coming over.

2254
01:30:54,530 --> 01:30:55,430
Get over here.

2255
01:30:56,230 --> 01:30:56,870
Oh my god.

2256
01:30:56,890 --> 01:30:57,330
There it is.

2257
01:30:57,630 --> 01:30:58,590
There it is.

2258
01:30:58,670 --> 01:30:59,790
Oh my god.

2259
01:31:02,090 --> 01:31:02,810
Oh my god.

2260
01:31:02,830 --> 01:31:03,650
The final worm.

2261
01:31:04,070 --> 01:31:06,030
The final worm for my child.

2262
01:31:08,630 --> 01:31:09,510
It's coming.

2263
01:31:09,590 --> 01:31:10,250
Don't worry.

2264
01:31:11,590 --> 01:31:13,390
Mama's coming to feed ya.

2265
01:31:14,250 --> 01:31:14,690
Okay.

2266
01:31:14,750 --> 01:31:15,710
I think I'm going the right way.

2267
01:31:16,610 --> 01:31:17,050
Finally.

2268
01:31:19,350 --> 01:31:22,810
Your OC is looking sexy finding worms.

2269
01:31:23,070 --> 01:31:23,570
Okay.

2270
01:31:23,590 --> 01:31:24,990
There's a lot to unpack there.

2271
01:31:25,470 --> 01:31:28,010
That's a lot to unpack there.

2272
01:31:28,090 --> 01:31:28,550
Sir.

2273
01:31:29,210 --> 01:31:29,730
Alright.

2274
01:31:29,850 --> 01:31:30,470
Here it is.

2275
01:31:31,010 --> 01:31:31,530
Alright.

2276
01:31:31,570 --> 01:31:31,910
Here we go.

2277
01:31:32,370 --> 01:31:32,890
Eggman.

2278
01:31:33,970 --> 01:31:35,270
Eggman, I got your worm.

2279
01:31:35,410 --> 01:31:36,210
Your final worm.

2280
01:31:38,510 --> 01:31:39,790
Are you happy now?

2281
01:31:40,070 --> 01:31:40,270
Oh.

2282
01:31:40,430 --> 01:31:40,950
Oh.

2283
01:31:44,810 --> 01:31:46,290
What the fuck is...

2284
01:31:50,410 --> 01:31:51,090
What?

2285
01:31:51,350 --> 01:31:52,030
What?

2286
01:31:54,070 --> 01:31:55,310
Oh my god.

2287
01:31:56,510 --> 01:31:57,530
Oh my god.

2288
01:31:57,550 --> 01:31:58,270
Now he's...

2289
01:31:58,270 --> 01:31:58,650
Oh my god.

2290
01:31:58,650 --> 01:31:58,650
Now he's...

2291
01:31:58,650 --> 01:31:59,650
Now he's a mama too.

2292
01:32:00,510 --> 01:32:02,930
He gave birth to a fucking podium.

2293
01:32:03,610 --> 01:32:05,030
I'm so proud of you.

2294
01:32:05,330 --> 01:32:07,010
I'm a grandma now.

2295
01:32:07,610 --> 01:32:10,610
I'm a grandma now.

2296
01:32:10,610 --> 01:32:12,070
I'm a grandma now.

2297
01:32:12,470 --> 01:32:13,370
Look at that.

2298
01:32:14,050 --> 01:32:15,810
I got my own...

2299
01:32:15,810 --> 01:32:17,750
I got my own grandson.

2300
01:32:20,030 --> 01:32:21,870
He's got a chair.

2301
01:32:27,130 --> 01:32:28,610
Oh my god.

2302
01:32:29,410 --> 01:32:30,650
Look at him go.

2303
01:32:31,050 --> 01:32:33,250
Now he's also a single parent.

2304
01:32:33,790 --> 01:32:34,710
Like what?

2305
01:32:34,810 --> 01:32:35,210
What?

2306
01:32:35,290 --> 01:32:36,110
What are you doing?

2307
01:32:36,330 --> 01:32:36,850
What?

2308
01:32:37,550 --> 01:32:38,430
Are you...

2309
01:32:38,430 --> 01:32:38,930
What?

2310
01:32:40,530 --> 01:32:40,870
What?

2311
01:32:40,870 --> 01:32:40,970
What?

2312
01:32:46,680 --> 01:32:49,560
One out of a thousand players.

2313
01:33:01,530 --> 01:33:03,030
Oh, Sonic has ascended.

2314
01:33:03,150 --> 01:33:04,990
You have one ascension.

2315
01:33:05,650 --> 01:33:06,950
God in the sky.

2316
01:33:10,590 --> 01:33:12,030
Submit your name to paradise.

2317
01:33:12,670 --> 01:33:13,490
What was it?

2318
01:33:14,410 --> 01:33:15,690
sexy outfit?

2319
01:33:16,630 --> 01:33:17,270
Oh.

2320
01:33:17,270 --> 01:33:22,230
Oh, I can only... I can only have like five characters, guys.

2321
01:33:22,630 --> 01:33:24,150
So I'm gonna submit this.

2322
01:33:24,630 --> 01:33:25,150
Sexy...

2323
01:33:25,150 --> 01:33:26,010
Oh god!

2324
01:33:30,670 --> 01:33:32,950
That's gonna be my name, guys.

2325
01:33:33,310 --> 01:33:34,850
That's gonna be my name.

2326
01:33:34,970 --> 01:33:37,370
Apparently I can't have more than five characters.

2327
01:33:37,630 --> 01:33:40,210
So that's gonna be my name.

2328
01:33:40,290 --> 01:33:42,350
That's gonna be my name.

2329
01:33:44,830 --> 01:33:45,470
Yay!

2330
01:33:49,170 --> 01:33:49,970
We did it!

2331
01:33:51,830 --> 01:33:53,610
Oh, is my audio cutting in and out?

2332
01:33:53,710 --> 01:33:56,350
Did the game break my audio?

2333
01:34:00,990 --> 01:34:03,330
No, it's okay on my end!

2334
01:34:03,650 --> 01:34:05,630
On my end it's okay!

2335
01:34:06,810 --> 01:34:08,630
The stream was like...

2336
01:34:10,530 --> 01:34:11,650
Is it better now?

2337
01:34:12,350 --> 01:34:13,190
Holy shit!

2338
01:34:15,540 --> 01:34:17,250
Holy shit, is it better now?

2339
01:34:17,550 --> 01:34:19,190
I ascended so hard.

2340
01:34:19,490 --> 01:34:20,570
The stream died.

2341
01:34:21,030 --> 01:34:22,870
I ascended the YouTube...

2342
01:34:22,870 --> 01:34:23,470
Fuck!

2343
01:34:23,510 --> 01:34:23,890
Fuck!

2344
01:34:24,010 --> 01:34:24,210
Fuck!

2345
01:34:24,250 --> 01:34:24,670
The...

2346
01:34:25,280 --> 01:34:25,630
I...

2347
01:34:25,630 --> 01:34:29,310
I ascended and then the game just shut down.

2348
01:34:29,590 --> 01:34:31,810
The YouTube just shut down.

2349
01:34:31,910 --> 01:34:33,390
They're like, we can't handle this anymore.

2350
01:34:33,870 --> 01:34:34,410
Wow!

2351
01:34:34,790 --> 01:34:35,530
That was it!

2352
01:34:36,960 --> 01:34:40,210
That was the Sonic Dream Collection.

2353
01:34:41,050 --> 01:34:46,770
I am so happy to be able to share this game with all of you!

2354
01:34:47,090 --> 01:34:47,650
I...

2355
01:34:50,670 --> 01:34:54,050
The game couldn't handle it.

2356
01:34:56,350 --> 01:34:57,170
Yeah!

2357
01:34:58,730 --> 01:35:00,490
I enjoyed my stay.

2358
01:35:03,610 --> 01:35:08,770
I'm so happy to share you a game from the 90s.

2359
01:35:08,770 --> 01:35:09,570
I know.

2360
01:35:09,570 --> 01:35:10,190
I know.

2361
01:35:10,190 --> 01:35:15,130
You guys all keep saying, Doki, we want you to play retro games.

2362
01:35:15,870 --> 01:35:19,670
Doki, when are you gonna play retro games again, Doki?

2363
01:35:19,930 --> 01:35:20,830
Look, see?

2364
01:35:21,010 --> 01:35:24,670
I literally played four retro games for all of you.

2365
01:35:24,710 --> 01:35:26,210
All in one stream.

2366
01:35:27,270 --> 01:35:29,030
And I shared with you...

2367
01:35:29,030 --> 01:35:37,690
I shared with you the best Sonic game that was ever made for the Sonic franchise.

2368
01:35:38,810 --> 01:35:39,790
It was really exciting.

2369
01:35:39,790 --> 01:35:42,010
I'm really happy to be able to share this with all of you.

2370
01:35:42,110 --> 01:35:47,790
I think, I think like, not gonna lie, my director skills, 10 out of 10.

2371
01:35:47,990 --> 01:35:50,110
I think I like improved so much.

2372
01:35:50,330 --> 01:36:04,290
I improved so much in directing and like, um, and like producing and like camera angles and the Dutch angle and film noir.

2373
01:36:04,430 --> 01:36:05,770
Oh my God.

2374
01:36:05,830 --> 01:36:09,690
All of those scenes, 10 out of 10, honestly.

2375
01:36:09,690 --> 01:36:09,770
10 out of 10.

2376
01:36:15,470 --> 01:36:15,910
Honestly.

2377
01:36:15,910 --> 01:36:16,590
Oh my God.

2378
01:36:16,930 --> 01:36:17,890
Holy shit.

2379
01:36:18,070 --> 01:36:19,910
I'm happy to be able to share it with you guys.

2380
01:36:19,990 --> 01:36:25,170
That was like honestly one of the, one of the games that I've always wanted to play on stream.

2381
01:36:25,370 --> 01:36:27,070
So I'm glad that...

I can't...

2411
01:37:11,790 --> 01:37:13,670
Actually, no, it's a gift.

2412
01:37:13,770 --> 01:37:18,570
It's a gift that on your birthday, you get to watch this stream.

2417
01:37:31,150 --> 01:37:32,670
Happy birthday to you.

2418
01:37:32,810 --> 01:37:34,350
Happy birthday, dear Shadow.

2419
01:37:34,650 --> 01:37:35,950
Happy birthday to you.

2420
01:37:36,070 --> 01:37:36,530
Yay!

2421
01:37:38,230 --> 01:37:38,830
Max!

2422
01:37:38,950 --> 01:37:42,390
I really got, never really got art games until now.

2423
01:37:42,490 --> 01:37:43,210
Thank you for the super chat.

2424
01:37:43,290 --> 01:37:43,530
Thank you.

2425
01:37:43,630 --> 01:37:44,050
Thank you.

2426
01:37:44,210 --> 01:37:45,230
Yeah, so...

2427
01:37:47,390 --> 01:37:53,070
Honestly, honestly, best, uh, I wish AAA games were made like this again.

2428
01:37:53,310 --> 01:37:59,270
Uh, I feel like, not gonna lie, like, a lot of AAA games, they just, they just can't do it.

2429
01:37:59,290 --> 01:38:00,870
Like, they used to be able to make games.

2430
01:38:01,090 --> 01:38:02,930
A lot of AAA, they just fell off.

2431
01:38:03,170 --> 01:38:08,150
They just don't know what the audience really, don't know what gamers actually want these days.

2432
01:38:08,190 --> 01:38:08,670
You know?

2433
01:38:09,110 --> 01:38:10,490
AAA game titles.

2434
01:38:10,670 --> 01:38:16,370
So it's really nice to go back to like when games were actually fun.

2435
01:38:22,860 --> 01:38:29,560
Oh my god, it's really great to relive back in the days when they just knew what we wanted.

2436
01:38:29,780 --> 01:38:34,600
They just knew exactly what we wanted in a AAA game title.

2437
01:38:34,860 --> 01:38:40,340
And back then, Sega knew exactly what Sonic fans, um...

2438
01:38:40,520 --> 01:38:42,580
Um, wanted in a game title.

2439
01:38:42,820 --> 01:38:50,840
And that's why Sonic 3 Collection is Game of the Decade in the 90s.

2440
01:38:54,400 --> 01:38:55,480
Yeah.

2441
01:38:56,420 --> 01:38:57,320
When they...

2442
01:38:58,460 --> 01:39:01,160
Especially my roommate, Sonic.

2443
01:39:02,960 --> 01:39:04,640
Sonic fans rejoice.

2444
01:39:04,780 --> 01:39:06,420
Sonic fans rejoice.

2445
01:39:06,420 --> 01:39:09,300
Sonic fans rejoice.

2446
01:39:09,300 --> 01:39:09,800
Sonic fans rejoice.

2447
01:39:09,800 --> 01:39:10,340
When Sega...

2448
01:39:10,400 --> 01:39:10,500
When Sega...

2449
01:39:10,520 --> 01:39:11,680
Finally...

2450
01:39:11,680 --> 01:39:15,460
Subcommed to the Sonic fandom's demands.

2451
01:39:16,740 --> 01:39:29,900
You know that all Sonic fans back then, in 1999, were so fucking happy about my roommate, Sonic.

2452
01:39:30,180 --> 01:39:30,980
It was a...

2453
01:39:30,980 --> 01:39:35,800
It was truly a Christmas gift for all Sonic fans.

2454
01:39:36,560 --> 01:39:39,400
When will we ever get Sonic Dreams remake?

2455
01:39:39,400 --> 01:39:40,380
SEGA!

2456
01:39:41,760 --> 01:39:47,100
You're out here remaking, remastering so many Sonic games.

2457
01:39:47,300 --> 01:39:50,560
I want a remaster of Sonic Dreams.

2458
01:39:50,940 --> 01:39:51,280
Alright?

2459
01:39:51,840 --> 01:39:53,260
That's all I want.

2460
01:39:53,660 --> 01:39:54,960
That's all I want.

2461
01:39:55,160 --> 01:39:55,660
In life.

2462
01:40:01,120 --> 01:40:02,860
Nick, thank you for the super chat.

2463
01:40:02,920 --> 01:40:03,620
Thank you, thank you.

2464
01:40:03,680 --> 01:40:06,020
This is why the Dreamcast found us a console.

2465
01:40:06,020 --> 01:40:07,320
Thank you for the super chat.

2466
01:40:07,420 --> 01:40:08,400
Thank you, thank you.

2467
01:40:08,700 --> 01:40:09,340
Thank you.

2468
01:40:09,380 --> 01:40:10,280
Thank you for the super chat.

2469
01:40:10,340 --> 01:40:11,020
Thank you, thank you.

2470
01:40:11,160 --> 01:40:13,000
I'm still trying to figure out what I was watching.

2471
01:40:13,320 --> 01:40:14,580
Peak gaming.

2472
01:40:15,180 --> 01:40:16,580
That is what you were watching.

2473
01:40:16,860 --> 01:40:23,340
I know like it's hard to recognize it because of all the garbage we've been given over the recent years from gaming companies.

2474
01:40:23,800 --> 01:40:24,640
But like...

2475
01:40:25,160 --> 01:40:33,000
I know like you have like a little bit like some Stockholm syndrome at the moment from like all the fucking slop we've been given from like AAA gaming.

2476
01:40:33,300 --> 01:40:34,200
But like...

2477
01:40:34,200 --> 01:40:34,960
Back then!

2478
01:40:35,140 --> 01:40:38,260
That is what we call real game.

2479
01:40:38,520 --> 01:40:39,360
A real game.

2480
01:40:39,360 --> 01:40:40,300
A real video game.

2481
01:40:41,260 --> 01:40:47,760
And all that entire collection in the 90s was just $599.

2482
01:40:48,280 --> 01:40:49,680
Is that crazy?

2483
01:40:49,820 --> 01:40:54,140
It wasn't $40 with like a $50 DLC.

2484
01:40:54,620 --> 01:41:05,920
Back then you can buy one CD for $599 and it contained all those games in the Sonic Dreams collection.

2485
01:41:07,190 --> 01:41:07,680
Hahaha.

2486
01:41:09,360 --> 01:41:10,440
True value!

2487
01:41:11,100 --> 01:41:15,260
If you're lucky, you can might even find in your local thrift store.

2488
01:41:16,340 --> 01:41:19,040
Steam is a coward.

2489
01:41:19,200 --> 01:41:23,980
Sega is a fucking coward for not releasing it on Steam.

2490
01:41:24,460 --> 01:41:24,840
Hahaha.

2491
01:41:28,040 --> 01:41:30,180
Look, thank you for the super chat.

2492
01:41:30,340 --> 01:41:30,700
Thank you.

2493
01:41:30,720 --> 01:41:31,240
Thank you.

2494
01:41:31,320 --> 01:41:34,020
That is my first quadruple A game.

2495
01:41:34,380 --> 01:41:35,820
Thank you for the super chat.

2496
01:41:35,920 --> 01:41:36,300
Thank you.

2497
01:41:36,320 --> 01:41:36,960
Thank you.

2498
01:41:37,080 --> 01:41:37,700
Hahaha.

2499
01:41:37,740 --> 01:41:38,380
Hahaha.

2500
01:41:38,700 --> 01:41:39,340
Hahaha.

2501
01:41:39,360 --> 01:41:39,720
Hahaha.

2502
01:41:41,900 --> 01:41:42,360
Um...

2503
01:41:43,280 --> 01:41:43,740
Uh...

2504
01:41:45,040 --> 01:41:46,480
Oh no, I meant quadruple.

2505
01:41:46,520 --> 01:41:47,800
It's quintuple game.

2506
01:41:48,480 --> 01:41:49,700
But then thank you for the super chat.

2507
01:41:49,780 --> 01:41:50,020
Thank you.

2508
01:41:50,020 --> 01:41:50,480
Thank you.

2509
01:41:50,480 --> 01:41:55,180
Thank you Doki for making tomorrow rest day so we can see our therapist tomorrow.

2510
01:41:55,540 --> 01:41:56,960
Thank you for the super chat.

2511
01:41:57,080 --> 01:41:57,500
Thank you.

2512
01:41:57,520 --> 01:41:58,100
Thank you.

2513
01:41:58,180 --> 01:41:58,600
Hey!

2514
01:41:58,600 --> 01:42:03,520
To tell them about the great time you had watching it, right?

2515
01:42:04,380 --> 01:42:05,100
Right guys?

2516
01:42:05,600 --> 01:42:12,760
Talk about your experience with how much fun you had enjoying this stream with your therapist.

2517
01:42:13,600 --> 01:42:14,200
Um...

2518
01:42:14,200 --> 01:42:15,400
Thank you for the super chat.

2519
01:42:15,460 --> 01:42:15,700
Thank you.

2520
01:42:15,720 --> 01:42:16,060
Thank you.

2521
01:42:16,100 --> 01:42:19,260
This game was very, was indeed very kino.

2522
01:42:19,700 --> 01:42:21,040
Kubrick is envious.

2523
01:42:21,120 --> 01:42:22,680
Thank you for the super chat.

2524
01:42:22,800 --> 01:42:23,180
Thank you.

2525
01:42:23,180 --> 01:42:23,920
Thank you.

2526
01:42:24,200 --> 01:42:27,720
Alright guys, I'm going to call it here now.

2527
01:42:27,960 --> 01:42:31,120
I love to chat with you guys longer but um...

2528
01:42:31,120 --> 01:42:32,480
I have a lot of work to do...

2529
01:42:32,480 --> 01:42:34,940
I know I keep saying that I haven't been able to do a long..

2530
01:42:34,940 --> 01:42:36,300
chatting stream with all of you guys.

2531
01:42:36,780 --> 01:42:37,260
Um...

2532
01:42:38,400 --> 01:42:40,960
Ah but I've just been so busy.

2533
01:42:41,200 --> 01:42:42,880
And ah... almost everyday.

2534
01:42:43,340 --> 01:42:45,440
And I hope that things calmed down soon.

2535
01:42:45,640 --> 01:42:48,220
So like we can have our usual chatting......

2536
01:42:48,220 --> 01:42:49,580
Ah chatting streams.

2537
01:42:49,580 --> 01:43:01,640
I had to cut it short.

2538
01:43:01,820 --> 01:43:06,160
But I hope you guys had a fun time watching me play Sonic Dreams Collection.

2539
01:43:06,580 --> 01:43:09,340
It's honestly one of the games I've been wanting to stream for a very long time.

2540
01:43:09,460 --> 01:43:15,620
So I'm happy to be able to finally experience this game with all of you.

2541
01:43:17,980 --> 01:43:19,080
But thank you guys.

2542
01:43:19,200 --> 01:43:19,560
I'll see you guys in the next one.

2543
01:43:19,560 --> 01:43:20,040
Uh...

2544
01:43:20,040 --> 01:43:21,620
I'll read this last Super Chat.

2545
01:43:21,720 --> 01:43:22,340
Thank you for the Super Chat.

2546
01:43:22,440 --> 01:43:23,120
Thank you, thank you.

2547
01:43:23,240 --> 01:43:26,120
I listened to the stream while driving home from work today.

2548
01:43:26,420 --> 01:43:29,380
Audio only, so I had zero context for anything.

2549
01:43:29,700 --> 01:43:33,780
I just keep hearing you shout about feeding Sonic and break it down.

2550
01:43:34,820 --> 01:43:37,240
That is enough context that you need.

2551
01:43:37,320 --> 01:43:37,820
Don't worry.

2552
01:43:38,060 --> 01:43:39,060
That's all you need.

2553
01:43:39,180 --> 01:43:39,740
Do not worry.

2554
01:43:39,960 --> 01:43:41,240
But thank you for the Super Chat.

2555
01:43:41,320 --> 01:43:42,100
Thank you, thank you.

2556
01:43:42,320 --> 01:43:43,040
Alright, guys.

2557
01:43:43,220 --> 01:43:45,080
As always, everybody, stay hydrated.

2558
01:43:45,440 --> 01:43:46,020
Posture check.

2559
01:43:46,100 --> 01:43:48,140
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

2560
01:43:48,140 --> 01:43:49,580
And then you stay up for me.

2561
01:43:49,700 --> 01:43:50,520
Head to bed.

2562
01:43:50,640 --> 01:43:51,860
Because you deserve it.

2563
01:43:51,980 --> 01:43:53,000
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

2564
01:43:53,440 --> 01:43:54,140
Bye, guys.

2565
01:43:54,580 --> 01:43:54,980
Bye!
