1
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,200
Hello everybody!

2
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:02,800
Hello!

3
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:08,500
I hope the music is not too loud because, oh my god, it is
very loud on my hand.

4
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:11,700
Hello everybody!

5
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,860
I cannot believe it.

6
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:23,620
We're finally going to play the best Sonic game ever created
which I've yet to ever, which I've never played before.

7
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:40,040
That's when you know that it is a really good game because
even i know this is the best sonic game ever but okay it's a

8
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:47,000
little loud let me turn that down shift down don't worry it
was very loud for me too look this game was made in like the

9
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:57,060
the 90s okay like there was no like sound balancing or like
mixing like sound mixing and balancing in game was not a

10
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:07,120
thing back in the 90s guys just to remember see it was made
in 96 97 98 and 99 so game audio balancing was not a thing

11
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:17,640
back then the 90s were a different time guys uh many thank
you for the super chat thank you thank you it's like a car

12
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:28,980
crash i don't what do you mean this this in my opinion is no
i feel like in my opinion uh sonic dreams collection is one

13
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,660
of the best Sonic game collection they have ever made.

14
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:45,020
Each one, Make My Sonic, Eggman Origin, Sonic Movie Maker,
and my roommate Sonic, I would say, like, all of them, 10

15
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:45,440
out of 10.

16
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:47,260
Never played either any of them before.

17
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:55,340
But, like, just reading the names, I can tell that it is a
10 out of 10 game.

18
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,980
So, for those who are wondering, like, what is the lore?

19
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,280
behind Sonic Dreams Collection.

20
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:12,800
Well, obviously, none of us, obviously, like, not a lot of
us grew up with Sonic Dreams Collection, but I've heard

21
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:22,480
that, like, these games were released only back then for,
like, one year, like, when it was released, it was only out

22
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,560
for a limited time.

23
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:31,800
So, like, not a lot of people were able to actually play
these games back then in 96, 97, 98, 99 so they recently

24
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:35,040
re-released it like 10 years ago

25
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:54,220
it was recently re-released 10 years ago so so those who
didn't grow up back then um to be able to play these games

26
00:05:54,220 --> 00:06:13,900
missed out on what was considered Sonic gaming so it's been
10 years yes it has been almost 10 years since the

27
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:26,660
collection came out also by the way so like wait who Sega so
I was gonna be like who made Sonic Sega contracted these

28
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:36,400
developers because back then Sega was like, we should hire
American developers to make a Sonic game.

29
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:39,940
So they contacted these developers.

30
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:51,880
And after making what was known as one of the best Sonic
collection games ever, they went on to make Tadotel and Neon

31
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:52,340
White.

32
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,640
Is that crazy?

33
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:54,540
I can't believe.

34
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:55,340
No wonder.

35
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,840
No wonder Neon White was so good.

36
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:02,280
They came from dream collection they can never miss

37
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:16,900
they don't miss they knew what the consumer wants back in
the 90s and now they know what the consumer wants in the

38
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:30,280
2023 so true they don't miss uh court jester thank you for
the super chat thank you thank you I've never heard of the

39
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:33,460
best Sonic game there is can't wait to experience it through
you.

40
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:33,940
Thank you.

41
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:35,020
Thank you for the super chat Thank you.

42
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:35,420
Thank you.

43
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:43,560
I've never played this game before but like through word of
mouth from the people who played it in the 90s I I heard it

44
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:56,100
was a really good I've been I've been wanting to play this
game for a very long time But it was just so perfect that

45
00:07:56,100 --> 00:08:03,740
was very hard to be able to like play play it at its current
time because like you know they wanted to they released

46
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:13,860
re-released it 10 years ago and like they want to keep they
want to keep the peak gaming experience 10 years ago

47
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:23,500
untouched because you had to be there in the moment when it
was re-released so it was very hard to play it now But now,

48
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:24,980
now I can.

49
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:27,080
Now I can.

50
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:33,340
Now we get to finally experience this game with all of you.

51
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,320
Sonic 06 is better.

52
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:37,200
Lies!

53
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:45,080
Sonic 06 wishes it was just as good as my roommate Sonic.

54
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:50,280
They wish they were just as good as my roommate Sonic.

55
00:08:52,580 --> 00:09:04,060
I have not played before but I believe that my roommate
Sonic has has the best beginning middle and end it's rich

60
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:39,680
I don't even know if my sound guy is alive.

61
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:40,960
Sound guy!

62
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:42,400

63
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:49,000
You know it's good when the resolution is 1280x960.

64
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:50,720
Okay.

65
00:09:55,700 --> 00:10:06,100
That's when you know When the resolution is pure retro
That's when you know it's a good game It is Sound guy, how's

Thank you, thank you.

77
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,000
Look at that.

78
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,580
I have endorsements.

79
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,540
I have like witnesses.

80
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:39,880
Wait, what's that word?

81
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,820
What's that word when someone is vouchers?

82
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:47,180
I have vouchers from real Sonic fan.

83
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,240
Anyway, it's time to make my Sonic.

84
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:52,560
Make my Sonic was MJ Studio's first prototype.

85
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:56,260
with Sega, a Sonic OC original character creator.

86
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:59,940
MJ Studio was committed to fan self-expression.

87
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:05,880
They believed that Sonic was versatile enough for every
genre, even sci-fi.

88
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:13,620
Originally, Make My Sonic was meant to create and upload
avatars for use with every Dreamcast through SegaNet.

89
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:17,620
Sadly, no future games supported this level of creativity.

90
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,040
Oh my gosh.

91
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,380
Honestly, I feel like Sonic peaked it.

92
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:23,680
and make my Sonic.

93
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,940
They try to do that with the, what was it, the A-force
Sonic?

94
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:36,980
Because I forgot, remember that Sonic game they made where
you create your OC in Sonic, but then it was like, it was so

95
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:37,940
bad.

96
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:41,500
Was it Sonic Forces?

97
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,300
Yeah, Sonic Forces.

98
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:48,320
You know, they, they knew, they knew they could never make,
make my Sonic.

99
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:56,680
They, they try to repeat perfection, but they couldn't,
didn't like recreate perfection uh dark blade thank you for

100
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:02,980
the magenta soup but thank you thank you doki when i was
hoping you played more sonic games i really didn't mean this

101
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:08,160
what do you mean of course what do you mean i would start
off with the best sonic game they've ever made why would you

102
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:15,120
say that dark blade are you trying to say make my sonic 96
where we can make my our very own sonic original character

103
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:19,280
it's not peak gaming how could you say that we all want to
have a sonic

104
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:23,380
Let's go.

105
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:25,640
All right.

106
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:26,540
What do we want?

107
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:27,560
All right.

108
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,540
We want a small head.

109
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:31,440
Oh.

110
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:34,060
Turtle the king.

111
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:35,240
Cheating.

112
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:38,000
All right.

113
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:38,520
How about.

114
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:39,120
Okay.

115
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:41,000
Small head for small hitbox.

116
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:41,380
You know.

117
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,200
I'm trying to.

118
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:43,340
No headshot.

119
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:43,780
You know.

120
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:45,720
No headshot.

121
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:46,340
Is there yellow?

122
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:47,260
Yellow Sonic?

123
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,160
All right.

124
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:48,940
Yellow Sonic.

125
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:49,260
Where?

126
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:50,500
I want to be yellow Sonic.

127
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:51,640
All right.

128
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:52,420
Yellow.

129
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:53,140
Sonic.

130
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,800
Okay, background color.

131
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:56,760
Uh, you know what?

132
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:58,540
All yellow.

133
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,000
That'll be good.

134
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:00,700
All...

135
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:01,600
Oh, they don't even have yellow?

136
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:04,340
How can they have yellow Sonic, but no yellow?

137
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:06,600
Also, is that why your colors match?

138
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:07,500
Exactly!

139
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,420
Yoko, thank you for the super chat.

140
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:10,480
Thank you, thank you.

141
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:12,700
Exactly, Yoko.

142
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:15,280
Now you're thinking Sonic right now.

143
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,200
Now you're thinking Sonic.

144
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,800
Oh, there's a yellow background!

145
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:24,100
Oh, wait, I can move this.

146
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,580
Wait, I can pose for...

147
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:28,560
Um...

148
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,540
I can pose.

149
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:30,340
Can I, like...

150
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:30,880
Is this all...

151
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:31,840
Okay, I can just move this.

152
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:32,600
Okay.

153
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:35,600
Alright, I wanna...

154
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:35,900
Alright.

155
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:36,720
You know what?

156
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:38,760
You're levitating Sonic.

157
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:47,480
You know, you can figure out your Sonic OC by, like, putting
your name in Google and then writing, like, Doki the

158
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,120
Hedgehog.

159
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,680
And then you can have your own very own Sonic OC.

160
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:54,560
Apparently, every name has a Sonic OC at this point.

161
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:55,260
Alright.

162
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:56,740
What do I...

163
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:57,020
Okay.

164
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,840
Okay, he's gonna be running.

165
00:13:58,940 --> 00:13:59,600
He's a runner.

166
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:00,440
Alright.

167
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:02,780
What is... What is our...

168
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:03,740
Oh, okay, cheap.

169
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:04,580
Okay, I can't type.

170
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:08,480
Sorry, back in the 90s, it was very hard to code in.

171
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:14,160
It was very hard to code in, like, the ability to type your
name.

172
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:19,420
So, unfortunately, they had to make, like, custom names for
everybody.

173
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:27,500
But there were so many custom names that you can pick from
that like everybody had like their own name you know look

174
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:39,740
back in 96 back in 96 it was it was very hard there was only
like five megabytes okay like each each like CD for oh god

they wanted to like capitalize on the Sonic fandom because

181
00:15:54,560 --> 00:16:03,520

Vocaloid was in Make My Sonic

00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:06,760
No!

231
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,480
I forgot it's 96!

232
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,420
Sorry, back then.

233
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:13,160
I just need you guys to know.

234
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:16,300
Back then, there was a Twitter beta.

235
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:26,060
So, like, only people who have Sonic Dreams Collection, only
people who access MakeMySonic had the access to, like,

236
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,200
Twitter beta.

237
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,640
So, like...

238
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:43,140
they first tested out twitter on make my sonic uh because
they wanted to see what it was like to connect your game to

239
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:50,800
like twitter so it was like the first twitter connection i
know not only they just don't make twitter like they do in

240
00:19:50,800 --> 00:20:00,140
96 like i know wikipedia said twitter came out but after 96
um back yeah back in 96 it was called Twitter.

241
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,560
I know like all these like youngins are like, what's
Twitter?

242
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:05,080
Are you talking about X?

243
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:10,440
Back in 96, X was actually called Twitter.

244
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:24,180
And they had an exclusive deal with Make My Sonic to test
out some features where you can connect your account to

245
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:25,820
twitter.com.

246
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:36,540
And so, it was like the first Twitter photos and it's true
it's true you can look it up in the Sonic Wikipedia it's so

247
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:47,780

How was I supposed to color Sonic the Hedgehog?

272
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:58,860
Huh?

273
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,960

274
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,960

275
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:08,560

You know, it's official.

281
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:33,420
I can't believe it.

282
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,580
I'm so sad.

283
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:36,000
My OC.

284
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:39,620
My OC is not on SegaNet.

285
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:45,400
All the other Sonic OC fans can't comment on my beautiful OC
now.

286
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:56,280
I'm so I'm so sad this is truly the gold era of gaming it
can't possibly get better can it well the great thing about

287
00:23:56,280 --> 00:24:05,740
these American developers is that every year they've outdone
themselves it's actually crazy if you guys thought make my

288
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:13,080
sonic was that great you should check out Eggman origin
never played it but I assume every game gets better from

289
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:18,820
what I've heard is known about Eggman Origin.

290
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:21,680
There's no surviving documentation.

291
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:26,740
From digging through the code, we can tell it was an MMORPG.

292
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:30,540
A few have ever seen past the title screen.

293
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:34,140
Oh my god, we're gonna be one of the few!

294
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:43,920
Guys, it is such an honor to play Eggman Origins for all of
you.

295
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:48,080
Sonic MMORPG.

296
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,140
Eggman Origins.

297
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:51,640
Wait, what?

298
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,520
No network adapter connected.

299
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:55,700
How do I get this?

300
00:24:59,440 --> 00:24:59,820

304
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:08,840

00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:11,100
How do I install the network adapter?

306
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:13,040
It's so ancient!

307
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,040
This...

308
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:21,180

309
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,660

310
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:25,340

336

Your sponsorship with Sega has been revoked because you play
this.

351
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:21,800
That is how could they revoke my sponsorship with Sega when
this is an official an official game from Sega Company?

352
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,000
How is that possible?

00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:48,380
Who took my account?

382
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:55,280
The code is hidden in 98.

383
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:56,440
All right, sorry.

384
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:58,920
Unfortunately, we won't be able to...

385
00:30:58,920 --> 00:30:59,880
We'll figure it out.

386
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:00,820
We'll figure it out.

387
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:02,280
We'll go to Sonic Movie Maker.

388
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:03,060
All right.

389
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:06,380
Sonic Movie Maker was many years ahead of its time.

390
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:14,880
Technically speaking, MJ Studio envisioned a movie making
program for players to explore and share their desires with

391
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,940
the rest of the world.

392
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:21,500
Internal, the 90s Doki Bird took my account.

393
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:24,000
Doki Bird from 96.

394
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:33,440
Internal notes suggest that Sega executives pulled the plug
after learning about some of Sonic movie makers' darker

395
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,340
subplots.

396
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:44,480
Don't worry those who had FOMO were able to grab a copy of
Sonic Movie Maker So this was like a partnership with

397
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:51,140
Microsoft Because like you know how like some companies want
to add like a little spice To like a little crossover collab

398
00:31:51,140 --> 00:32:02,120
So like Microsoft Movie Maker Collabed with Sonic with Sega
to make like a Sega skin for like movie maker So uh so

399
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:07,820
that's great It was like really easy back then to like make
movies Look at that.

400
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:11,720
Oh my god, the Sonic movie maker.

401
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:18,660
It was the precursor for Miku-Miku's That's Good Times.

402
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:21,440
Alright.

403
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:27,460

00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:32,720
Is that.

452
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:37,460
Is that you throw a ball.

453
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:38,700
Oh my God.

454
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:41,740
We throw the ball up in the sky.

455
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:43,160
Wait, where'd the ball go?

456
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:46,120

00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,140
Alright, oh, there's the ball!

462
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:11,700
Okay, okay, we're gonna put you under the car because, uh, a
car you got, now you have, uh, you're gonna commit insurance

463
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:11,920
fraud.

464
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:15,700
Because dad suggested you to commit some insurance fraud.

465
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:18,880
Because dad is not doing so well financially right now.

466
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:22,380
So we have to film this for insurance.

467
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:23,580
All right.

468
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:25,380
We need to put you under here.

469
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:29,900
How do we lead from insurance fraud to playing catch?

470
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:31,040
It's all right.

471
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:33,260
This is a very low budget film.

472
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:35,920
All right.

473
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:36,340

considered um the best game they've ever made in the

907
01:05:22,270 --> 01:05:33,310

like I like write this down so my roommate Sonic 99 is

908
01:05:33,310 --> 01:05:44,970
considered one of the best games they've uh they've ever uh
they've ever made in this collection um I've never played

909
01:05:44,970 --> 01:05:52,190
this before but I assume that it's considered better than
Sonic Movie Maker so if it's better than Sonic Movie Maker

910
01:05:52,190 --> 01:06:01,930
then this might be true peak gaming at that point this game
was my childhood see look at that this person seems like

somebody that's played my roommate Sonic made in 1999 at
least like a hundred times also back then they were like

It fills my day with laughter.

You get a happy birthday in Cantonese.

1387
01:37:01,680 --> 01:37:03,060
Thank you for the super chat, Shadow.

1388
01:37:03,480 --> 01:37:04,380
Sci-fi law.

1389
01:37:06,040 --> 01:37:18,820
little concerning that the the actually no it's a gift it's
a gift that on your birthday you get to watch this stream

1392
01:37:33,100 --> 01:37:34,640
Happy birthday, dear Shadow.

1393
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:36,300
Happy birthday to you.

1394
01:37:36,400 --> 01:37:36,840
Yay!

1395
01:37:38,440 --> 01:37:42,500
Max, I really got, never really got art games until now.

1396
01:37:42,620 --> 01:37:43,320
Thank you for the super chat.

1397
01:37:43,440 --> 01:37:43,920
Thank you.

1398
01:37:43,920 --> 01:37:44,240
Thank you.

1399
01:37:44,620 --> 01:37:53,260
Yeah, so honestly, honestly, best, uh, I wish AAA games were
made like this again.

1400
01:37:53,640 --> 01:37:59,320
I feel like, not gonna lie, like a lot of AAA games, they
just, they just can't do it.

1401
01:37:59,360 --> 01:38:03,200
Like, A lot of AAA, they just fell off.

1402
01:38:03,400 --> 01:38:06,000
They just don't know what the audience really...

1403
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:10,660
Don't know what gamers actually want these days, you know,
with AAA game titles.

1404
01:38:11,140 --> 01:38:16,960
So it's really nice to go back to, like, when games were
actually fun.

1405
01:38:22,950 --> 01:38:24,050
Oh my god.

1406
01:38:24,110 --> 01:38:29,710
It's really great to relive back in the days when they just
knew what we wanted.

1407
01:38:30,110 --> 01:38:32,670
They just knew exactly what we wanted.

1408
01:38:33,070 --> 01:38:34,770
in a AAA game title.

1409
01:38:35,250 --> 01:38:42,830
And back then, Sega knew exactly what Sonic fans wanted in a
game title.

1410
01:38:43,270 --> 01:38:51,170
And that's why Sonic Dream Collection is Game of the Decade
in the 90s.

1411
01:38:56,130 --> 01:38:57,890
When they...

1412
01:38:57,890 --> 01:39:01,310
Especially my roommate, Sonic.

1413
01:39:03,070 --> 01:39:05,110
Sonic fans rejoiced

1414
01:39:08,130 --> 01:39:16,250
when Sega finally succumbed to the Sonic fandom's demands.

1415
01:39:17,170 --> 01:39:30,150
You know that all Sonic fans back then in 1999 were so
fucking happy about my roommate Sonic.

1416
01:39:30,610 --> 01:39:36,430
It was a it was truly a Christmas gift for all Sonic fans.

1417
01:39:37,390 --> 01:39:39,770
When will we ever get Sonic Dreams remake?

1418
01:39:40,170 --> 01:39:40,530
Sega!

1419
01:39:42,130 --> 01:39:47,310
You're out here remaking, remastering so many Sonic games.

1420
01:39:47,770 --> 01:39:50,930
I want a remaster of Sonic Dreams.

1421
01:39:51,230 --> 01:39:51,490
Alright.

1422
01:39:52,050 --> 01:39:53,510
That's all I want.

1423
01:39:54,030 --> 01:39:56,230
That's all I want in life.

1424
01:40:01,170 --> 01:40:02,950
Nick, thank you for the super chat.

1425
01:40:03,070 --> 01:40:03,730
Thank you.

1426
01:40:03,830 --> 01:40:06,190
This is why the Dreamcast found us at Council.

1427
01:40:06,570 --> 01:40:07,430
Thank you for the Super Chat.

1428
01:40:07,750 --> 01:40:07,930
Thank you.

1429
01:40:09,010 --> 01:40:10,350
Henry, thank you for the Super Chat.

1430
01:40:10,570 --> 01:40:10,670
Thank you.

1431
01:40:10,930 --> 01:40:11,150
Thank you.

1432
01:40:11,470 --> 01:40:13,190
I'm still trying to figure out what I was watching.

1433
01:40:13,610 --> 01:40:14,790
Peak gaming.

1434
01:40:15,610 --> 01:40:16,750
That is what you were watching.

1435
01:40:17,190 --> 01:40:23,030
I know, like, it's hard to recognize it because of all the
garbage we've been given over the recent years from gaming

1436
01:40:23,030 --> 01:40:23,730
companies.

1437
01:40:24,330 --> 01:40:30,170
But, like, I know, like, you have, like, a little bit, like,
some Stockholm syndrome at the moment from, like, all the

1438
01:40:30,170 --> 01:40:33,050
fucking slop we've been given from, like, AAA gaming.

1439
01:40:33,070 --> 01:40:45,550
rings but like back then that is what we call real game a
real video game and all that entire collection in the 90s

1440
01:40:45,550 --> 01:41:00,570
was just 599 is that crazy it wasn't 40 dollars with like a
50 dollar DLC back then you can buy one CD for 599 and it

1441
01:41:00,570 --> 01:41:07,210
contained all those games in the Sonic Dreams collection.

1442
01:41:09,390 --> 01:41:10,830
True value.

1443
01:41:11,450 --> 01:41:15,770
If you're lucky, you might even find it in your local thrift
store.

1444
01:41:16,730 --> 01:41:19,130
Steam, or Steam's a coward.

1445
01:41:19,390 --> 01:41:24,330
Sega's a fucking coward for not releasing it on Steam.

1446
01:41:28,370 --> 01:41:30,330
Look, thank you for the super chat.

1447
01:41:30,630 --> 01:41:31,350
Thank you, thank you.

1448
01:41:31,570 --> 01:41:33,050
That is my first quadruple.

1449
01:41:33,070 --> 01:41:34,430
Drupal A game.

1450
01:41:34,730 --> 01:41:35,930
Thank you for the Super Chat.

1451
01:41:36,250 --> 01:41:36,370
Thank you.

1452
01:41:36,690 --> 01:41:37,130
Thank you.

1453
01:41:41,850 --> 01:41:42,350
Oh,

1454
01:41:45,630 --> 01:41:46,550
I made quadruple.

1455
01:41:46,690 --> 01:41:48,210
It's a quintuple game.

1456
01:41:48,850 --> 01:41:49,030
Put in.

1457
01:41:49,070 --> 01:41:49,790
Thank you for the Super Chat.

1458
01:41:49,990 --> 01:41:50,070
Thank you.

1459

Thank you.

1460
01:41:50,550 --> 01:41:55,490
Thank you, Doki, for making tomorrow rest day so we can see
our therapist tomorrow.

1461
01:41:55,950 --> 01:41:57,110

1468
01:42:32,530 --> 01:42:36,510
I know I keep saying that I haven't been able to do a long
chatting stream with all of you guys.

1469
01:42:39,150 --> 01:42:43,370
But I've just been so busy almost every day.

1470
01:42:43,690 --> 01:42:45,670
And I hope that things calm down soon.

1471
01:42:45,870 --> 01:42:51,590
So we can have our usual chatting streams where you can just
chat after the game.

1472
01:42:52,310 --> 01:42:57,710
But at the moment, there's just so much work to do,
especially in preparation for the charity stream on

1473
01:42:57,710 --> 01:42:58,290
Saturday.

1474
01:42:58,690 --> 01:43:01,270
So I really do apologize that we have to come.
