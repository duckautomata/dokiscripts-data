1
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:56,450
No, I followed you like when you were at your peak.

2
00:01:57,330 --> 00:01:57,850
So...

3
00:01:57,850 --> 00:01:57,970
Oh!

4
00:01:58,330 --> 00:01:58,850
Ow!

5
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:00,150
Ow!

6
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:01,390
Okay, you know what?

7
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:02,090
You can just...

8
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:04,190
You can just take the attitude...

9
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:05,430
.

10
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:07,430
Ow!

11
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:10,690
I guess I'm washed up, Jack.

12
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:13,550
I mean, how many years ago it was...

13
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:16,110
I guess I'm washed.

14
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,250
Washed up.

15
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:21,170
I mean, it was one clean.

16
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:51,130
One click.

17
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:52,230
Alright, alright.

18
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:53,070
How about...

19
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:56,930
How about you follow me first and I'll give you your shoutout.

20
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:58,590
It's just that easy.

21
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:00,550
Because that's the thing.

22
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:02,590
He's the issue, right?

23
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:03,550
He's the issue.

24
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:08,010
Whether Fuzzy gets the shoutout or not doesn't benefit me at all.

25
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:12,370
Yeah, but you clearly want to do this for your chatter.

26
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:17,870
You clearly... because it's day two and you're still on about this Fuzzy guy.

27
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:20,690
You could have moved on after day one.

28
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:23,550
Yeah, but I don't think he can move on.

29
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:24,170
That's the issue.

30
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:31,210
Yeah, so if you really like your chatter, if you really appreciate them, follow me on Twitter right now.

31
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:33,410
Fuzzy, Fuzzy, are you in my chat still?

32
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:33,910
How much...

33
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:36,750
Or Fuzzy, ditch that guy and come to my chat.

34
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:37,750
I'll appreciate you.

35
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:40,630
Fuzzy, Fuzzy, you're fucking Fuzzy!

36
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:41,610
Fuzzy sucks!

37
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:47,090
Fuzzy, if you come to my chat, I'll give you a shoutout and I won't even... only on my stream.

38
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:50,590
Yeah, no, he just said, I'm in Doki's chat right now.

39
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:50,970
Yeah.

40
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:56,570
Oh, shit, yeah, and your guy was like, I'm the Sonic chatter too.

41
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:59,870
Oh, man, your fans coming to me now.

42
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:01,130
I don't need that follow.

43
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:02,150
I got Fuzzy already.

44
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:03,850
Take him, take him.

45
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:06,930
You don't need him?

46
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:07,390
Alright!

47
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:10,430
That's why you got ninthplace.com to break your Fuzzy.

48
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:13,410
Other viewers in Sonic chat, I would appreciate you.

49
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:16,110
I would follow somebody to give you that shoutout.

50
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:17,770
But apparently Sonic doesn't care.

51
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:20,110
Sonic doesn't care at all.

52
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:23,010
It's literally one click!

53
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:26,670
That's right!

54
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:28,370
The offer's gonna go.

55
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:34,050
Alright, if you don't do that follow, you'll never get that shoutout or Sonic or Fuzzy back.

56
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:36,270
Fuzzy, you're gonna have to beg me for this.

57
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:40,650
You're gonna have to beg me for this, because there's no incentive.

58
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:47,050
The fact that you can't even do one click, says a lot.

59
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:47,850
Yeah.

60
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:53,050
Fuzzy, I didn't mean it.

61
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:53,350
I'm sorry.

62
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,930
Fuzzy, you don't have to beg in my chat.

63
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:05,230
Listen, listen, Doki, I can tell we're both stubborn people, so how about this?

64
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:05,730
Alright, yeah?

65
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:06,990
How about this?

66
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:09,190
I don't follow you.

67
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:10,770
Yeah?

68
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:12,590
But...

69
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:13,070
But?

70
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:14,290
You shout out Fuzzy anyway.

71
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:15,210
Alright, goodbye.

72
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:16,950
Fuzzy's my chatter now.

73
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:18,930
You know what?

74
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:19,370
Take him.

75
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:19,750
You know what?

76
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:20,530
Fuzzy, you're gonna have her.

77
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:21,790
I'm not here.

78
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:22,230
I'm not here.

79
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:22,630
I'm not here.

80
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:23,430
I'm not here.

81
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:26,570
I won't do the run that you made then.

82
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:33,270
Listen, if there's a chance in this next mini-game where I can save your life and, you know, we can both, you know, survive and thrive together, okay?

83
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:36,270
I'm clicking the eject button and I'm gonna watch you perish.

84
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:37,010
Okay?

85
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:38,810
I'm gonna watch you perish.

86
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:39,690
Okay?

87
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:41,090
I'm gonna be... I'm gonna be...

88
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:44,530
All I'm saying is that I have the support of my fans.

89
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:46,470
I don't know about you.

90
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:46,890
I'm gonna be clasping my hands together.

91
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:47,510
Okay?

92
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:49,250
I'm gonna be clasping my hands together.

93
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:52,410
I guess you fall to your demise.

94
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:56,010
Feels like you're projecting Sonic.

95
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:57,630
Maybe I am, okay?

96
00:05:57,670 --> 00:05:58,470
Is that such a bad thing?

97
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:01,150
Oh shit!

98
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:03,170
Fuzzy, thanks for the sub, Fuzzy!

99
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:04,750
Oh my god!

100
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:08,470
Fuzzy, you're not a real one.

101
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:11,210
You're not the real one.

102
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:13,010
You won't do stuff for your homies.

103
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:14,270
I'm not real at all.

104
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:20,330
Alright, hey guys.

105
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:21,310
So like...

106
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:22,550
Yeah, like...

107
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:25,210
That came out of nowhere.

108
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:29,070
I was literally eating and then Sonic just came over.

109
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:30,490
It was like, hey.

110
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:31,430
And I was like, hey.

111
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:34,330
While I was trying to eat.

112
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:37,650
I was really trying to speedrun my fucking lunch.

113
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:40,070
During the waiting room.

114
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:42,730
Alright.

115
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:47,830
I only have my half finished fucking meal in front of me.

116
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:51,130
The content came to me.

117
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:54,070
SonicFox jumpscare.

118
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:55,650
I was like, oh shit, okay.

119
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:57,490
I guess it's content time.

120
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:00,430
Hello everybody.

121
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:02,110
Welcome to day two.

122
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:04,070
You know like, okay, you know what's funny?

123
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:09,410
After day one, I was like, oh my gosh, why did I...

124
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:12,570
I was like, oh my god.

125
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:16,350
I could have been eliminated and just chilled.

126
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:24,090
And like, I told my friends and my friends were like, bro, you could have like...

127
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:26,790
Why did you do this to yourself?

128
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:30,710
And I was like, but I just wanted to win.

129
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:31,670
Yeah, my fault.

130
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:32,890
I just wanted to survive.

131
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:33,770
My fault.

132
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:37,270
And then, yeah, and then my friends were like, you're so stupid.

133
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:42,830
So, I guess I'll be here for day two.

134
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:47,070
I'm pretty sure I'm gonna get eliminated on day two though.

135
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:49,250
Oh my gosh, but my exposure!

136
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:53,370
My free exposure, chat!

137
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:56,130
For the 1k?

138
00:07:56,330 --> 00:08:00,430
Bro, 1k I need to survive for like two more days, guys.

139
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:01,150
Like...

140
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:06,130
This lobby is like 90% Minecrafters.

141
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:08,950
There is no way any of us are gonna...

142
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:16,790
Any of the normies out here that don't play Minecraft are gonna survive to day three and four.

143
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:18,330
Oh my god.

144
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:26,630
Anyway, so yeah, welcome to day two of the Minecraft Twitch Rivals, the haunted house.

145
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:34,790
I think the next... this game, this game that we're gonna be doing is like we're supposed to like dodge the monsters or something.

146
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:38,170
And like run from them and avoid them.

147
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:40,490
So, that's basically it.

148
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:42,330
I don't know the... let me know the cinematics.

149
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:44,350
By the way, there's no emote mode today.

150
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:47,050
Yeah, apparently you don't have to.

151
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:48,250
Like monsters are gonna be chasing us.

152
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:49,610
Like we have to cross some zones.

153
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:53,690
And then we have to... we have to cross some zones and...

154
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:59,930
Get to the monsters and like get... avoid the monsters and stuff to the safe zone.

155
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:02,230
What else do I want to say?

156
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:03,750
Oh yeah, there's no emote mode this time.

157
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:06,610
Because there's nothing to ghost at the moment.

158
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:07,630
So, there's no emote mode.

159
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:09,830
So, you guys can like backseat me for...

160
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:11,330
You know, if there was...

161
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:16,190
If there was no emote mode in the very first game, I would have known about the tech.

162
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:20,030
You guys would have yelled at me about this.

163
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:21,310
The jump tech, guys.

164
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:24,290
You guys would have done... yelled at me about this.

165
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:26,830
Anyway, is Fuzzy still in my chat?

166
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:27,290
Fuzzy?

167
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:28,650
Oh wait, I hear Gloomy.

168
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:30,610
Gloomy!

169
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:32,190
Hi!

170
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:36,030
Doki, I was looking for you earlier and I found you but you were AFK.

171
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:37,530
Wait, oh yeah, yeah.

172
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:38,550
Now I'm not... I was eating.

173
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:39,730
Wait, why is there a ghost here?

174
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:41,450
What's she doing here?

175
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:41,810
I don't know, I'm following her.

176
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:44,250
Doki, you can rest people in the next game.

177
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:45,350
Oh, okay, okay.

178
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:45,970
We gotta stick together.

179
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:47,550
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

180
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:48,710
It's like Infants Legends.

181
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:49,670
Okay, okay, okay.

182
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:50,570
We gotta stick together.

183
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:51,910
Hear my voice.

184
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:53,890
Well...

185
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:54,130
Yeah.

186
00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:57,330
Don't... I'll be screaming.

187
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:58,610
Don't worry if I die.

188
00:09:58,810 --> 00:10:02,550
I'm gonna stick with Antfrost and you can stick with me with Antfrost.

189
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:03,210
Oh, okay, okay.

190
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:05,690
And then Antfrost will carry both of us.

191
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:06,410
Yeah.

192
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:07,270
Yeah?

193
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:08,770
Yeah, because he's so strong.

194
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:12,090
Yeah, you're so... Oh my god, Antfrost, have you been working out?

195
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:13,390
Yeah.

196
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:14,490
Antfrost, wow!

197
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:14,990
Wow!

198
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:18,210
Oh my god!

199
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:20,810
Have you been working out?

200
00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:20,990
Yeah.

201
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:25,190
Has anyone ever told you that you might be the best Minecraft player in the server?

202
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:27,010
Yes, thank you, Charlie.

203
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:28,570
You're my best friend.

204
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:29,310
Okay, I'm not even disgusting.

205
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:30,350
Me too, me too, me too, me too, me too, me too.

206
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:33,270
I'm just like, I don't know.

207
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:34,550
Me puppy, me puppy.

208
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:34,850
I'm just like, I don't know.

209
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:36,630
Cursing on accident.

210
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:42,450
It's okay, as long as like... as long as we... I think it only matters if you're in the finals.

211
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:44,890
Alright, you've been going around the world.

212
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:44,970
I've been going around the world.

213
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:46,930
Yeah, I don't think so either.

214
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:48,390
I think they just added that for fun.

215
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:52,330
Where the fuck?

216
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:53,350
Where were all the urchins?

217
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:56,510
I think you are.

218
00:10:56,610 --> 00:10:57,350
I think you're gonna make it.

219
00:10:57,410 --> 00:10:57,850
You're gonna be fine.

220
00:10:58,590 --> 00:10:59,770
I was like, what?

221
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:02,070
Are we still following the ghost?

222
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:04,690
Guys, I don't think the ghost leads anywhere, guys.

223
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:05,530
No, no.

224
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:07,990
Guys, there's so many people.

225
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:09,150
I'm getting overwhelmed.

226
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:09,830
Oh my god!

227
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:10,230
Please!

228
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:10,790
Please!

229
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:13,910
Okay, I'm gonna find a corner to hide.

230
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:14,950
There's two people.

231
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:15,830
Too many voices!

232
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:18,750
Voices, do you hear all those voices?

233
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:22,810
There's too many voices!

234
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:23,990
What do they say?

235
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:27,130
Alright, I'm gonna eat my lunch, by the way.

236
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:31,950
I was speedrunning the convention crowd.

237
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:32,930
No man.

238
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:35,830
Oh my god, but yeah, I can't believe it.

239
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:38,330
The... the... what's the word?

240
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:45,290
My will to win overpowered my rational thinking.

241
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:48,090
Because I was just like...

242
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:51,410
You know, I was like, oh my god, I made it to the next day!

243
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:56,390
And then like, 30 minutes later, the realization came in.

244
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:59,270
I was like, oh my god, I made it to the next day.

245
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:02,290
Hey!

246
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:06,850
Where's your allies?

247
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:09,250
I think I got this one.

248
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:12,850
Yeah, oh, you need an ally, don't you, Erob?

249
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:15,150
I apparently know where three more are.

250
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:17,770
Oh, you desperate now?

251
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:22,970
I mean, we were both friends in Mendoza, so I think it's...

252
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:24,850
We're like, allies today.

253
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:25,910
Oh yeah, yeah?

254
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:27,930
You wanna be allied with a VTuber?

255
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:31,390
Is that where you're at in your life now?

256
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:34,490
I have nothing against VTubers.

257
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:37,710
Yeah, you have nothing against VTubers?

258
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:40,590
I have nothing against VTubers.

259
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:41,710
Is that what your chat's saying too?

260
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:44,790
Is that what your chat's saying too?

261
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:46,890
My chat does not represent me.

262
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:49,410
Oh, it doesn't represent you.

263
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:52,070
Oh, so you're saying your chat's liars then?

264
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:52,930
Oh, so you're saying your chat's liars then?

265
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:54,730
My chat does not reflect me.

266
00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:56,250
Oh, I see, I see.

267
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:58,790
Well, you know like this game, you can res people, right?

268
00:12:58,970 --> 00:12:59,690
The next game?

269
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:03,490
Yeah, so I got you, you got me.

270
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:04,430
Yeah!

271
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:06,110
Yeah!

272
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:07,830
Right?

273
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:16,170
Hey!

274
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:18,110
I know E-Rob's desperate for allies.

275
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:21,370
Cuz all his allies are dead.

276
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:27,450
Oh, my stamina's on cooldown?

277
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:29,770
Okay, we've got five- Oh, Gumi Gumi's here.

278
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:30,210
Alright.

279
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:31,970
Here we go.

280
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:36,370
Yeah, all his allies died, did not make it.

281
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:37,990
Alright.

282
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:39,330
Yeah, we have stamina now.

283
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:41,990
Yeah, apparently like- oh my gosh, my fucking food.

284
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:43,250
I can't even eat my food!

285
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:44,150
God damn it!

286
00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:48,830
Alright, we have voice chat reconnecting in three minutes.

287
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:49,590
Oh no, I lost her.

288
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:52,290
I looked away to put my food away!

289
00:13:57,910 --> 00:13:58,350
Alright.

290
00:13:58,650 --> 00:14:00,530
Yeah, I know E-Rob's desperate now.

291
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:07,030
He needs- he needs people.

292
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:09,570
Wait, I lost her.

293
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:10,250
Guys!

294
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:11,430
Where did Gumi go?

295
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:16,730
Look, I will carry E-Rob, Gumi will carry me, and then- and Frost will carry Gumi.

296
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:18,230
We'll have like a chain.

297
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:22,990
We'll have- we'll have a chain of people helping.

298
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:26,590
Where the fuck did Gumi go?

299
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:28,890
Oh, guys, guys, it's time to find Where's Gumi?

300
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:30,550
Our favorite game.

301
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:33,170
Where- oh, there- there she is.

302
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:33,650
Nice.

303
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:33,930
Okay.

304
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:35,710
Alright, the chain will start.

305
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:36,250
The circle.

306
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:40,430
Alright, so like apparently you can rez people.

307
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:46,170
And all we need to do is make sure we don't fucking die.

308
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:52,350
Or if we do die, that- that we're close to- we're close to our allies.

309
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:58,750
Okay, let's see, let me- I feel like I should adjust the volume a little bit.

310
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:02,950
I'll put it at 90 because some of the- the volume is so fucking loud sometimes.

311
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:06,230
But also like, let me double check if...

312
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:07,750
Uh...

313
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:11,530
That bring up the game volume.

314
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:12,650
Okay.

315
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:15,570
My sound guy says bring up the game volume.

316
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:16,950
Wait, there's like more stuff now.

317
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:21,710
I guess I'll bring up the music and the environment.

318
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,300
Okay, I don't know if that's better.

319
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:30,520
Alright, let's go!

320
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,360
Also, for all the new viewers here!

321
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:36,440
Uh, I usually stream on the YouTube, so please check me out over there.

322
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,340
Uh, I do like the Twitch events.

323
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:41,520
The Twitch events I stream on Twitch because, you know...

324
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:45,020
Makes sense, they- Twitch invites- WHOA!

325
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:49,760
Okay.

326
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,220
The voices came back, chat.

327
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:02,600
Oh, sorry, I misread my sound guy.

328
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:05,460
He said bring it down, I brought it back up.

329
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,620
There we go.

330
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:08,280
Alright.

331
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:10,840
The voices came back, I got him.

332
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,340
We'll unmute when the voices start slowing down.

333
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,380
We'll fix that later.

334
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:22,300
There's just way too many- Too many people are still alive!

335
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:25,860
Too many people are still alive for this to work.

336
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:26,200
Okay.

337
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,480
The voices...

338
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,700
They're so loud.

339
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:33,500
There's like...

340
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,980
There's like music playing!

341
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:38,340
What the fuck?

342
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:42,080
Oh my god, took my meds and the voices are still coming!

343
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:49,100
Oh my god, this is purgatory.

344
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:54,420
We will- We will re-enable it when the gate round starts.

345
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:58,400
I don't think- I don't think I can deal with the voices at the moment.

346
00:16:59,160 --> 00:16:59,720
Okay.

347
00:16:59,720 --> 00:16:59,800
Okay.

348
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:05,360
So, the voices would- Guys, I forgot to take my meds.

349
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:06,980
Wait, no, I took my meds, guys.

350
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:07,700
Guys, it's working!

351
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:08,840
The meds are working!

352
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:10,120
The voices stopped!

353
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:14,840
Oh my god!

354
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,260
The voices- I told you!

355
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:21,220
Medicine works!

356
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:23,200
Oh god, your rob came back.

357
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:29,060
Don't worry, I'll- Make sure I'll keep taking my meds.

358
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,080
Alright.

359
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:36,640
We're gonna have to- We're gonna have to work together, guys.

360
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:38,480
This is a teamwork.

361
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:39,940
Your rob found us.

362
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,340
We're gonna have to work- Oh!

363
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:50,000
Monsters and prey.

364
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:58,080
What's this?

365
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:58,560
Hello again.

366
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:04,580
The House of Nightmare commends you for surviving the Conjurer's first two tests.

367
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:04,800
I did it!

368
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:09,580
It is now time to resume your challenged nightmares.

369
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:14,260
You will find yourselves in the basement.

370
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,260
In the basement?

371
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:19,020
Homes of many of our ferocious monsters and ghouls.

372
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:20,520
What the fuck?

373
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:24,080
You may escape via any elevator at the far end of the complex.

374
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:27,840
But, they can hold only 100 of you.

375
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:34,780
We have to get to their- To get to the elevators, you must proceed through two safe zones- Wait, that means eight people are gonna get in the elevator?

376
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:35,240
Eliminated.

377
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,400
That protect you from the monsters.

378
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,740
Wait, what protects me?

379
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:41,980
The third and final safe zone is the elevator.

380
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:49,220
Move quickly, because the last few people to reach the safe zone will not survive this nightmare.

381
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:50,340
Oh shit.

382
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,520
In total, ten of you will surrender yourselves to the House forever.

383
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:53,620
Oh shit, ten of us?

384
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:57,000
Guys, that's gonna be me.

385
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:02,380
Wait, what happens?

386
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:06,040
You will be injured and unable to move at a normal speed.

387
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:09,420
Oh, so I have to make sure I don't- If they are feeling- There's parkour?

388
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:14,740
Other players can heal you by crouching next to you, speeding up your recovery.

389
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,260
Oh no, there's parkour.

390
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:23,200
But this is not a time to rely on others, because it's everyone- Oh no, not platforming.

391
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:26,960
Each of you will have a stamina meter.

392
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,780
It will decrease as you sprint.

393
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:34,600
And if it hits zero, you will- You will lose the ability to sprint for three seconds.

394
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,620
It was a good run, guys.

395
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:36,720
It was!

396
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:39,040
Guys, it was a good run.

397
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,900
Now we have platforming.

398
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:46,820
Do your best to arrive in the safe zone as quickly as possible.

399
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:47,800
It was a good run.

400
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:54,360
If the gate closes before you arrive, you'll be ours forever.

401
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,420
The parkour is not that- Yeah, okay, for a normal person.

402
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:06,580
Guys, I already have the VTuber debuff.

403
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,640
I don't know what you want from me.

404
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:14,600
Guys, I learned the jump tech.

405
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:15,880
Oh my god, there's Kachow!

406
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:20,920
I learned the jump tech, like, after the game was over.

407
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:23,400
Okay.

408
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,240
Let's see.

409
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,640
Where is- Okay, we need to find- Wait, where's Gumi?

410
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,000
Where's Gumi?

411
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:33,080
Where is she?

412
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:34,840
I need her to res me when I get hit.

413
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:36,380
I need her to res me.

414
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:39,060
I need to be on her backpack.

415
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,140
Where's the backpack?

416
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,660
Where's- That is not very helpful, guys.

417
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:49,700
That is- Where the f- I don't know where- Oh, there's Gumi.

418
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:50,800
That's her.

419
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:51,920
Wait, is that her?

420
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:54,220
Is that- Yeah!

421
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:56,320
Okay.

422
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:58,220
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

423
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:00,020
We all stick together, yes?

424
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:00,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

425
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:01,480
Don't worry.

426
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:02,880
We stick together.

427
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:03,920
I'll save you if you save me.

428
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:04,260
Of course!

429
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:04,960
Of course!

430
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:05,900
Wait, who's our group?

431
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:07,160
Who else do we get?

432
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,600
People that are coming over here.

433
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,340
We're meeting here.

434
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:10,740
Whoever's here is in our group.

435
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:11,580
Oh, okay, okay.

436
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,760
Yeah, we're all gonna help each other out, right?

437
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:14,760
Warren, come here!

438
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:15,860
You wanna join our group?

439
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:16,420
Alright, guys.

440
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,380
Who's in this group?

441
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:19,920
All my friends.

442
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,240
Like, the cool people?

443
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:21,920
And if you're my friend, you would join.

444
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,600
All my friends.

445
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,440
So, Gumi?

446
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,740
Is that all your friends, Gumi?

447
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:26,800
Ooh, that's tough.

448
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:27,420
That's tough.

449
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,000
This is it?

450
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:28,640
This is everyone?

451
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,380
Well, not except for this guy.

452
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:30,620
This is it?

453
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:31,460
This guy's not our friend.

454
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:32,980
That's crazy.

455
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:33,560
Oh!

456
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:35,300
That's crazy.

457
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:37,120
Except for that one guy over there.

458
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,300
So many friends.

459
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:39,360
That's all.

460
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:42,120
I wish I had this many friends.

461
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:42,700
I wish you two.

462
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:43,580
Hey, I wish you two, man.

463
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:44,080
I'm helping him out.

464
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,060
I don't care who.

465
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,340
We need to get everybody through this.

466
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:47,840
Oh, you think so?

467
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,260
Yeah, totally me too.

468
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:49,620
Well, not everybody.

469
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:50,220
Because you can heal each other.

470
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:51,580
I'm saving everybody, Brad.

471
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:57,860
I think we need to stay near the beginning, but don't stay too close to the beginning.

472
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:58,660
Oh, so you wanna like...

473
00:21:58,660 --> 00:21:59,220
Like the front.

474
00:21:59,440 --> 00:21:59,920
So you wanna stutter.

475
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:02,380
Like get to the other side a little.

476
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:05,880
Yeah, let the people in the front kinda act like meat shields.

477
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:06,960
Oh, like the aggro.

478
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:08,220
They're all gonna be like...

479
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:08,340
They're all gonna be like...

480
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:08,980
They're all gonna be like all the mobs.

481
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:09,500
Yeah.

482
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:10,980
They're gonna die and they're gonna be like crying.

483
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:11,900
Save us!

484
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:12,500
Save me!

485
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:13,420
Save us!

486
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:14,880
And then Matt's just gonna run past them.

487
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:18,780
They cried out, save us, and I said no.

488
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:20,500
Okay, buddy.

489
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:21,480
You can save Goomy.

490
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:22,620
There's no way back to playing games.

491
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:23,420
Wait, where's Ad?

492
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:24,200
Bye, Goomy.

493
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,820
I thought Ad was supposed to help us.

494
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:27,200
I'll miss you, Goomy.

495
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,220
Ad keeps gathering people.

496
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:29,000
Oh, okay.

497
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:29,620
Okay, I'll stop.

498
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:31,780
I thought Ad was gonna betray us there.

499
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:34,020
No, he would never.

500
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:34,840
I know where he lives.

501
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:35,880
Yeah, where?

502
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,400
I'll keep it a secret.

503
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,140
I'm trying to hear you.

504
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:44,440
Me and my chat will keep it a secret.

505
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:50,660
2279 Acacia Street.

506
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:51,680
Oh, oh.

507
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:54,320
Okay.

508
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:57,000
Oh, no.

509
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:58,400
Okay.

510
00:22:59,560 --> 00:22:59,580
Okay.

511
00:22:59,580 --> 00:22:59,600
Okay.

512
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:00,080
I'm gonna go.

513
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:03,920
How am I supposed to win if we don't know his address?

514
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,080
Oh my god, two minutes.

515
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:06,480
Has it been eight minutes already?

516
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:07,200
Wait, really?

517
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:07,660
Damn.

518
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:12,580
All right, Goomy, you wouldn't let me die, right?

519
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,900
We'll advance to day three together, right?

520
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:26,580
All I'm saying, Goomy, is for the fourth game, if we combine our chat's IQs together to do the puzzle, we might be able to beat one puzzle.

521
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,600
We might be able to solve one puzzle.

522
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,200
We might be able to solve one puzzle together.

523
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:31,440
Did you hear the lyrics?

524
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:32,860
Okay, let's go look for our friends.

525
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:33,860
Hey, hey, hey.

526
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,100
Oh my god, everybody's talking.

527
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,020
I found one.

528
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:40,760
All right.

529
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,680
Wait, Bad Boy Halo is gonna help us?

530
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:44,760
Oh, I found them.

531
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:46,740
Oh, is that the group?

532
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:47,540
Yeah.

533
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,160
But it's like bobbing like crazy.

534
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:49,660
I don't like to...

535
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:53,160
You abandoned us.

536
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:53,900
I was scared.

537
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,880
You're gonna make sure we live right at...

538
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,540
Are they gonna find you?

539
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,400
We gotta stick together.

540
00:23:59,400 --> 00:23:59,580
Yeah.

541
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:03,680
Okay, so Bad wants to stutter, like to get to the other side tunnel too.

542
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:05,300
He wants to wait to leave a little.

543
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:08,820
I don't know about that either.

544
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:12,140
He said he wants to use people as meat shields, but I think the monster's reset.

545
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,960
They probably say in areas.

546
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:20,260
Yeah, maybe they're saying that so that he's gonna make us slow down and he's gonna be in the front.

547
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:22,840
Okay, why don't we all leave on the right hand side?

548
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,720
Why don't we all leave through the right hand side of the gate?

549
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:25,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

550
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:27,320
I like that.

551
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:28,800
That's a good idea.

552
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:29,240
And Rob's going to the right.

553
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:29,560
Okay, so...

554
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:30,580
Yeah, you can heal each other.

555
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:31,020
Okay.

556
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,660
Stick to the right body.

557
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,260
Oh, one more minute.

558
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:35,060
One more minute.

559
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,320
Wait, Shani, can't we like build that?

560
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:36,920
Yeah, exactly.

561
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:37,380
I'm scared.

562
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:38,020
Exactly.

563
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:39,140
Oh my god.

564
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:41,500
There's no way they're gonna let us die.

565
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:42,040
Right?

566
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,240
Okay, revive me.

567
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,580
Yeah, yeah, yeah, revive me too.

568
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:50,040
Well, we come as a couple, Dio.

569
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:50,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

570
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,140
We're like a package two for one.

571
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,500
A two for one Dio.

572
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:56,300
Oh my god.

573
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:57,540
There's so many of them.

574
00:24:58,500 --> 00:24:59,200
Oh my god.

575
00:24:59,280 --> 00:24:59,560
There's so many of them.

576
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:00,420
There's so many people.

577
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,240
I'm using the stamina thing.

578
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,300
I know, Fuzz.

579
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:03,920
Let's go over here.

580
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,560
Are you sprinting?

581
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:05,940
I'm sorry.

582
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:07,220
Okay, I'm coming over here.

583
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,560
Wait, you can...

584
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:12,100
Like hit W and then jump and then go W.

585
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:13,820
What?

586
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:15,020
What?

587
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:17,920
Just like hit W and then jump and then like go W.

588
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:19,740
And then sort of like jump along like this.

589
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:20,520
And then like...

590
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:22,960
Ah, sweet.

591
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:23,820
I understand what you mean.

592
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:24,760
I'm confused.

593
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:25,540
Okay, let's go.

594
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:26,400
I'm confused.

595
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:27,200
Go stand on the right side.

596
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:28,440
I'm confused.

597
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:29,440
Are we sprinting?

598
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:29,520
Are we sprinting?

599
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:29,940
We got this!

600
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:30,740
Oh!

601
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:32,180
Oh!

602
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:32,800
Oh!

603
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:33,740
Oh!

604
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:33,800
Oh!

605
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:33,960
Oh!

606
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:34,300
Oh!

607
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:34,680
Here we go!

608
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:37,660
The last one!

609
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:38,100
Gina!

610
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:38,540
Gina!

611
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:45,480
Where... where... where's my team?

612
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:48,820
Guys, turn off the music, please.

613
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:49,460
It's so annoying.

614
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:50,460
Where's my team?

615
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:53,600
I don't know where my team is!

616
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:54,700
Fuzz, you're behind you.

617
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:56,940
Is that my team?

618
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:58,120
Yeah.

619
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:01,080
Ohhhhhhh!

620
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:02,500
Oh no!

621
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:05,560
Oh, one guy fell.

622
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:06,560
One guy fell.

623
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:07,380
Okay, okay.

624
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:12,140
I can't see shit!

625
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:13,920
I'm stuck!

626
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:14,900
I can't see shit!

627
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:16,560
Guys, I don't know where to go!

628
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,740
Guys, I don't know where to go!

629
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:19,720
I can't see over there.

630
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:21,600
Help!

631
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:22,620
Help!

632
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:25,020
There's too many people!

633
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,000
Guys!

634
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:29,060
Am I doing anything?

635
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:30,500
I don't think I can get up here.

636
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,340
What the heck?

637
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:32,760
Okay.

638
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:36,000
I don't know where to go from here.

639
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:38,400
This is stressful!

640
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:39,400
Guys, it's over.

641
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:41,820
Guys, it's over.

642
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:44,380
Why are you not swimming?

643
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:45,780
Why are we on the top of the mountain?

644
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:47,840
It's so over.

645
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:49,040
I can't see.

646
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:49,900
Hi, Shane.

647
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,900
Shane, are you in F5 right now?

648
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:53,520
Yeah, I'm in F5.

649
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,560
What's going on?

650
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:57,560
Guys, I can't see anything.

651
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,660
Please get out of my face.

652
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,420
Oh, I can't see!

653
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:03,240
Open his mouth.

654
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,400
Guys, I don't know... Oh, wait!

655
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:07,180
It's in front of me!

656
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:08,240
I don't see you!

657
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:11,140
I don't see you!

658
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:12,100
But I think you're near me.

659
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:13,840
I see steps.

660
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:15,980
Just keep communicating with me.

661
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:17,840
Go under!

662
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:20,640
Go under!

663
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:23,300
Where is it?

664
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,780
I'm so confused!

665
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:28,040
I'm so confused!

666
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,060
I'm so confused!

667
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:32,280
I'm so confused!

668
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:33,580
Oh!

669
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:35,120
He's dead!

670
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:35,780
He's dead!

671
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,660
I saw somebody die!

672
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:40,260
Oh, my God!

673
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:41,780
Oh, my God!

674
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:42,180
Oh, my God!

675
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:44,940
Oh, F5, you're right!

676
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:45,800
Wait!

677
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,060
No, I can't!

678
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:48,400
Because I don't know where to look at!

679
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:49,320
Oh, my God!

680
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:50,200
He's a dead guy!

681
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:51,400
Oh, my God!

682
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:52,620
He's a dead guy!

683
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:54,600
Oh, they're so many dead people!

684
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:55,820
It's okay.

685
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:58,100
If I don't look behind me...

686
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:02,980
If I don't look behind me, everything will be fine!

687
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:05,320
Okay.

688
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:06,600
Okay.

689
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:08,400
We're recharging.

690
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:10,360
Okay.

691
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:11,160
It's fine!

692
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:12,080
Everything is fine!

693
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:12,600
Okay!

694
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:16,060
Okay, we're fine!

695
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:18,360
We're fine!

696
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:19,000
There's no way!

697
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:21,000
There's no way we're at the bottom!

698
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:21,540
Why?

699
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,580
Why are you guys doing this?

700
00:28:31,870 --> 00:28:33,330
Oh my god, the first save zone!

701
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:34,090
We made it!

702
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:40,630
Oh, that's the save zone!

703
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:41,050
Okay!

704
00:28:41,730 --> 00:28:44,870
Okay, I didn't like that sound.

705
00:28:45,050 --> 00:28:46,750
That sound was a little scary.

706
00:28:47,150 --> 00:28:48,730
It was a little sus.

707
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:52,870
Oh, we're on the save zone, so we all have to wait!

708
00:28:54,450 --> 00:28:56,210
We all have to wait!

709
00:28:56,210 --> 00:28:57,930
I think I got some kind of a laugh.

710
00:28:59,210 --> 00:29:00,230
Oh my god, nice!

711
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:03,870
We made it!

712
00:29:03,890 --> 00:29:04,410
We made it!

713
00:29:09,530 --> 00:29:13,610
We made it!

714
00:29:14,730 --> 00:29:15,410
We made it!

715
00:29:16,170 --> 00:29:16,790
We made it!

716
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:18,030
We made it!

717
00:29:18,050 --> 00:29:18,150
We made it!

718
00:29:19,430 --> 00:29:22,410
It might have been really fucked up, but we lived!

719
00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:39,210
Oh my god, nice!

720
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:40,570
Oh my god, thank you!

721
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:47,990
Oh my god, I feel... Oh my god, thank you!

722
00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:49,590
Finally!

723
00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:51,770
Oh my god!

724
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:56,190
Oh, everything is nice and quiet!

725
00:29:56,190 --> 00:29:56,830
Quiet now.

726
00:29:57,940 --> 00:29:59,530
We took our beds.

727
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:02,010
Oh thank god we took our beds.

728
00:30:07,910 --> 00:30:09,530
The voices are gone.

729
00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:11,350
I did it!

730
00:30:11,570 --> 00:30:14,070
I couldn't see what was going on!

731
00:30:14,150 --> 00:30:15,210
I have to F5!

732
00:30:16,610 --> 00:30:17,550
Wait, she...

733
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:18,730
Did you F5?

734
00:30:19,570 --> 00:30:20,570
I did it!

735
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:23,350
That was fucked up.

736
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:26,950
Remember that first obstacle with the trees?

737
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:28,310
That shit was crazy.

738
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:31,990
I don't even know how we got there.

739
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:33,030
I think we got TP'd.

740
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:37,630
Oh my god, E-Rob, you made it!

741
00:30:39,930 --> 00:30:40,590
Yeah, yeah!

742
00:30:40,850 --> 00:30:43,970
Were you like 107th or something?

743
00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:51,370
Oh my god, we did it guys!

744
00:30:51,710 --> 00:30:53,330
Yo, we barely made it.

745
00:30:55,730 --> 00:30:56,250
Oh my god.

746
00:30:56,250 --> 00:30:56,990
We did it!

747
00:30:57,110 --> 00:30:59,070
We did it for us!

748
00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:02,670
Oh my god, I can't believe it.

749
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:03,870
Did you see this?

750
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:05,270
Oh!

751
00:31:07,850 --> 00:31:09,410
I took my meds.

752
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:16,650
It's okay.

753
00:31:18,730 --> 00:31:19,650
Oh my god.

754
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:20,830
Silence.

755
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:24,830
The voices are gone.

756
00:31:25,610 --> 00:31:26,610
Oh, thank god.

757
00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:28,590
Thank god.

758
00:31:29,170 --> 00:31:30,030
Oh my god.

759
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:34,270
Guys, remember to take your meds or you're gonna have to listen to that the whole time.

760
00:31:34,650 --> 00:31:35,170
Oh.

761
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:38,450
Remember to take your meds, guys!

762
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:40,890
Take your meds!

763
00:31:40,910 --> 00:31:41,250
Take your meds!

764
00:31:41,930 --> 00:31:42,450
Alright.

765
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:44,550
We have two more checkpoints.

766
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:46,430
I think we can make it.

767
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:49,130
We weren't in the back of the pack, chat.

768
00:31:49,790 --> 00:31:50,830
Like, we weren't...

769
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:53,730
I think the moment I get hit by the monster, I'm fucked.

770
00:31:53,890 --> 00:31:55,030
I think that's really it.

771
00:31:55,130 --> 00:31:58,550
The moment the monster fucking touches me, like, it's over.

772
00:31:58,790 --> 00:32:01,230
Like, it's so over.

773
00:32:02,150 --> 00:32:05,090
We just shouldn't let the monsters touch me.

774
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:06,490
And we should be good.

775
00:32:06,770 --> 00:32:08,190
And we should be good.

776
00:32:08,190 --> 00:32:08,410
Oh!

777
00:32:08,770 --> 00:32:09,790
I feel like...

778
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:13,070
I feel like people don't revive because like...

779
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:15,030
It's just so chaotic.

780
00:32:15,170 --> 00:32:16,210
There's no way.

781
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:17,910
It's just so chaotic.

782
00:32:17,910 --> 00:32:20,070
Oh yeah, the parkour is gonna be crazy.

783
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:23,070
The people who don't have the F5 is gonna get fucked over.

784
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:26,310
Because I could not see.

785
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:29,010
I could not see in first person.

786
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:29,050
I could not see in first person.

787
00:32:29,450 --> 00:32:30,110
At all.

788
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:32,290
Everyone's just running.

789
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:34,650
Remember to conserve your stamina.

790
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:36,730
Yeah, I need to remember to do that too.

791
00:32:38,210 --> 00:32:39,210
Oh wait, it's time.

792
00:32:39,410 --> 00:32:40,170
We gotta get there.

793
00:32:40,570 --> 00:32:42,390
It's okay, we have peace and quiet.

794
00:32:42,690 --> 00:32:43,970
I can't wait for more people.

795
00:32:44,010 --> 00:32:45,870
I feel like we should be eliminating more people.

796
00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:46,610
It's just...

797
00:32:48,430 --> 00:32:50,690
108 is still too many people.

798
00:32:51,090 --> 00:32:52,390
It's still too many.

799
00:32:55,970 --> 00:32:57,770
We need to get rid of some.

800
00:32:59,430 --> 00:33:01,930
Yeah, this was not meant for this many people.

801
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:09,390
I feel like maybe have people each have their own parkour area.

802
00:33:09,890 --> 00:33:11,510
Like maybe divide it by 30.

803
00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:13,450
And then we have like 30 of these.

804
00:33:13,610 --> 00:33:15,410
And then we have like multiple...

805
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:17,890
multiple parkour areas.

806
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:19,490
And have 30 people in each.

807
00:33:19,970 --> 00:33:21,630
I feel like that would have been better.

808
00:33:23,390 --> 00:33:23,950
Yeah.

809
00:33:25,390 --> 00:33:27,490
It's just... yeah multiple lobbies.

810
00:33:27,510 --> 00:33:28,770
This is just too much.

811
00:33:28,930 --> 00:33:31,490
This actually is too much.

812
00:33:32,530 --> 00:33:33,650
I mean I can not...

813
00:33:33,650 --> 00:33:36,370
I can't even see where I am right now.

814
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:37,450
Like...

815
00:33:37,450 --> 00:33:40,370
Guys, I don't know if I should play in F5.

816
00:33:40,610 --> 00:33:43,170
I can't see where my body is.

817
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:45,310
Where am I?

818
00:33:45,310 --> 00:33:45,390
Where am I?

819
00:33:45,410 --> 00:33:47,750
I'm like in the...

820
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:49,230
I've been like in the...

821
00:33:49,230 --> 00:33:50,770
Holy shit!

822
00:33:50,850 --> 00:33:52,230
The game almost crashed.

823
00:33:53,050 --> 00:33:54,890
I'm like in the fucking club.

824
00:33:56,290 --> 00:33:57,050
Oh...

825
00:33:58,450 --> 00:33:59,210
Oh...

826
00:33:59,210 --> 00:34:00,450
Oh!

827
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:01,950
Where am I?

828
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:06,370
Guys...

829
00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:08,770
Guys, I'm not gonna...

830
00:34:08,770 --> 00:34:09,670
I don't...

831
00:34:09,670 --> 00:34:11,630
Guys, I think this was a mistake.

832
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:12,810
Guys...

833
00:34:15,410 --> 00:34:17,630
This seems to be a mistake now.

834
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:22,870
Oh no.

835
00:34:23,570 --> 00:34:24,830
Guys, I think it's over.

836
00:34:27,270 --> 00:34:27,850
Oh no.

837
00:34:27,850 --> 00:34:28,690
Guys, I think it's over.

838
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:30,290
Guys, I think it's over.

839
00:34:31,410 --> 00:34:33,170
Guys, I'm doing worse.

840
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:36,310
I'm actually doing worse.

841
00:34:36,770 --> 00:34:37,570
Oh no.

842
00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:38,730
Oh no.

843
00:34:39,850 --> 00:34:41,310
I'm doing worse guys.

844
00:34:41,790 --> 00:34:42,710
Oh no!

845
00:34:45,430 --> 00:34:46,810
Oh no, this is bad.

846
00:34:48,470 --> 00:34:49,170
Oh no, this is bad.

847
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:49,570
Okay, we gotta...

848
00:34:49,570 --> 00:34:50,490
We gotta do this.

849
00:34:50,650 --> 00:34:51,750
I'm actually doing worse now.

850
00:34:53,010 --> 00:34:54,990
We got it on F5 everybody.

851
00:34:55,950 --> 00:34:57,130
I can't see.

852
00:34:57,510 --> 00:34:59,550
I actually couldn't see guys.

853
00:35:00,010 --> 00:35:00,190
I actually couldn't see guys.

854
00:35:02,050 --> 00:35:03,310
Oh my god.

855
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:04,150
Okay.

856
00:35:04,650 --> 00:35:06,230
Don't worry, it's not over yet.

857
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:09,410
We just gotta have to make it to the second checkpoint everybody.

858
00:35:09,930 --> 00:35:10,410
We just gotta have to make it to the second checkpoint everybody.

859
00:35:10,410 --> 00:35:13,030
The moment we make it to the second checkpoint, we'll be okay.

860
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:13,210
Okay.

861
00:35:14,590 --> 00:35:15,410
Oh god.

862
00:35:16,170 --> 00:35:17,890
Oh yeah, that was definitely a mistake.

863
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:20,210
Whoever said F5, that was a mistake.

864
00:35:20,350 --> 00:35:21,250
Now we're fucked a little.

865
00:35:21,450 --> 00:35:24,470
Now we're a little fucked guys.

866
00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:26,690
Now we're a little fucked guys.

867
00:35:27,290 --> 00:35:27,730
Now we're a little fucked guys.

868
00:35:29,510 --> 00:35:29,950
Okay.

869
00:35:31,690 --> 00:35:33,410
I don't know how to like...

870
00:35:33,410 --> 00:35:34,490
I don't know how to like...

871
00:35:34,490 --> 00:35:35,350
make it so that...

872
00:35:35,350 --> 00:35:37,770
Guys, how do you make it so I don't use my stamina accidentally?

873
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:42,050
Because it won't let me cancel it.

874
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:43,830
I feel like...

875
00:35:43,830 --> 00:35:46,070
I feel like I can't cancel it.

876
00:35:48,810 --> 00:35:49,910
Oh, I got the one of the...

877
00:35:49,910 --> 00:35:52,330
No, no, no.

878
00:35:52,730 --> 00:35:53,230
Oh no.

879
00:35:53,990 --> 00:35:55,630
Do we have to do this again?

880
00:35:56,050 --> 00:35:57,010
We do.

881
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:02,130
No, my stamina!

882
00:36:04,790 --> 00:36:05,110
Okay.

883
00:36:05,990 --> 00:36:06,630
Okay.

884
00:36:07,310 --> 00:36:07,950
Okay.

885
00:36:08,610 --> 00:36:09,250
Okay.

886
00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:13,150
We're okay.

887
00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:14,370
No!

888
00:36:14,650 --> 00:36:15,410
We're not okay!

889
00:36:17,970 --> 00:36:18,810
Slow and steady.

890
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:20,370
Slow and steady, Doki.

891
00:36:20,890 --> 00:36:21,750
Slow and steady.

892
00:36:22,210 --> 00:36:23,190
It's parkour!

893
00:36:23,970 --> 00:36:26,010
There's people worse than you at parkour!

894
00:36:31,310 --> 00:36:31,790
No.

895
00:36:31,790 --> 00:36:32,470
Oh god.

896
00:36:37,290 --> 00:36:38,750
There's people back there...

897
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:40,410
that's worse than you at this.

898
00:36:41,810 --> 00:36:43,050
It'll be fine.

899
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:47,090
Oh god.

900
00:36:48,210 --> 00:36:50,730
There's people that are so cocky...

901
00:36:50,730 --> 00:36:52,310
when it comes to...

902
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:53,270
parkour!

903
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:54,470
Okay, nice.

904
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:56,770
You got this!

905
00:36:57,130 --> 00:36:57,830
Do I?

906
00:36:59,170 --> 00:37:00,110
Oh no.

907
00:37:00,450 --> 00:37:02,910
Oh my god.

908
00:37:03,390 --> 00:37:04,570
My stamina.

909
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:08,700
Okay.

910
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:10,280
Oh, there he is.

911
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:13,120
Oh god.

912
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:13,880
Oh god.

913
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:14,720
Oh god.

914
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:19,100
Oh, I'm so fucked.

915
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:22,560
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

916
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:22,960
No!

917
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:27,220
Woo!

918
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:30,700
Behind me!

919
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:32,020
Is he behind me?

920
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:32,560
I don't wanna look!

921
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:34,360
Oh god.

922
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:35,340
Oh god.

923
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:40,540
Fuck!

924
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:46,220
Oh, that's scary.

925
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,100
That was so scary.

926
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:49,400
Oh!

927
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:52,440
We're okay, we're okay, we're okay, we're okay, we're okay.

928
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:54,160
That was really scary.

929
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:55,740
But we're okay.

930
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:00,320
Oh my god.

931
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,840
I just saw somebody die in front of me.

932
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:04,180
Oh.

933
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:05,100
Shit.

934
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:08,760
Oh god.

935
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:10,120
Like...

936
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,800
It's so scary, cause like...

937
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:15,380
Oh, my hands are shaking.

938
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:16,420
I hate parkour.

939
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:17,920
Oh, guys!

940
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,000
This is so bad!

941
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,980
Cause my hands are actually shaking!

942
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:25,940
Oh god.

943
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:27,660
Oh!

944
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:29,340
Okay.

945
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:31,240
We gotta recharge our stamina.

946
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:34,240
Oh god.

947
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:34,980
Oh!

948
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:37,420
My hands are shaking so much!

949
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,440
Oh god.

950
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:45,580
Woo!

951
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:45,720
Woo!

952
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:50,640
I have to...

953
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:53,480
I'm so nervous, so I have to like...

954
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:54,920
Do it one by one.

955
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:56,680
Cause I'm so nervous.

956
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:02,360
Cause my hands are shaking so much.

957
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:04,180
Cause my hands are shaking so much.

958
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:08,040
Cause my hands are shaking so much.

959
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:09,820
Parkour makes me so nervous.

960
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:12,720
Okay.

961
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:15,860
Everything is okay.

962
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:17,580
Woo!

963
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:18,920
Woo!

964
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:20,080
Oh!

965
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:21,320
Okay.

966
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:25,140
Oh god.

967
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:26,940
Oh god, I thought I couldn't see.

968
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,320
I couldn't see right there.

969
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:30,260
Oh.

970
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:33,720
Because like, there's no way!

971
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:35,760
They just have to eliminate two, right?

972
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,420
There's no way I'm the last two!

973
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:41,160
I only messed up the parkour like once!

974
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:43,920
I only messed up the parkour like once!

975
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:45,780
Oh, I can't see.

976
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:47,940
Why is this so long?

977
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:51,160
Why was the first one so short?!

978
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:54,560
Why was the first one so short?!

979
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:54,820
Like...

980
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:56,780
Okay, this is bullshit.

981
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:59,660
The first one was so short.

982
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:01,440
And this feels like a...

983
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:05,560
The fucking level gap between the two.

984
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:06,780
The fucking level gap between the two.

985
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:09,980
Ugh.

986
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:11,660
Alright, here you go.

987
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:14,360
Please, I'd rather be average.

988
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:16,360
Let me be the middle of the pack.

989
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:19,260
Oh, thank god there's at least two people behind me.

990
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,600
Thank god.

991
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:26,540
Thank god.

992
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:27,340
There's at least...

993
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:29,740
Because there's at least two people behind me.

994
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:33,620
We should be fine.

995
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:40,680
Woo!

996
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:44,060
Oh my god, the fact that no one's at the safe zone yet.

997
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:45,840
It's concerning me.

998
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:46,820
Look at this.

999
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:53,220
No one's at the safe zone!

1000
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:58,100
There's still like 200 fucking parkour!

1001
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:00,520
It never ends.

1002
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:02,260
It never fucking...

1003
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:03,780
It's like the marathon all over.

1004
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:04,700
Oh my god.

1005
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:06,160
Oh no.

1006
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:07,900
I hope I have allies.

1007
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:09,600
I...

1008
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:13,160
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah.

1009
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:13,680
Okay.

1010
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,680
We have a conservative stamina here.

1011
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:15,820
I'm gonna go back to the safe zone.

1012
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:17,340
Oh god, oh god.

1013
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:18,800
Oh god.

1014
00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:21,040
I'm going left, I'm going left.

1015
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:23,660
It was too scary, so I'm gonna go left.

1016
00:41:28,410 --> 00:41:28,890
Oh.

1017
00:41:29,830 --> 00:41:33,750
I hope left is okay, because I only have one person I'm following.

1018
00:41:36,710 --> 00:41:37,590
Okay, nice.

1019
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:38,350
Okay.

1020
00:41:46,550 --> 00:41:47,030
Okay.

1021
00:41:47,030 --> 00:41:48,150
I'm a little worried.

1022
00:41:48,490 --> 00:41:49,790
That there was only...

1023
00:41:50,670 --> 00:41:51,830
one person that was there.

1024
00:41:55,470 --> 00:41:55,990
Okay.

1025
00:41:56,330 --> 00:41:56,690
Okay.

1026
00:41:59,130 --> 00:42:00,070
Oh, I'm getting better.

1027
00:42:00,890 --> 00:42:01,410
Wait.

1028
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:03,490
Oh god.

1029
00:42:03,890 --> 00:42:04,910
Someone made it.

1030
00:42:05,110 --> 00:42:06,430
That means there's an end.

1031
00:42:07,530 --> 00:42:08,490
Oh my god.

1032
00:42:08,850 --> 00:42:10,210
People are making it.

1033
00:42:10,270 --> 00:42:12,290
That means there is an ending to this.

1034
00:42:13,410 --> 00:42:14,430
Oh my god.

1035
00:42:15,150 --> 00:42:16,550
I can't believe it.

1036
00:42:20,790 --> 00:42:21,310
No!

1037
00:42:24,830 --> 00:42:25,670
Checkpoint's not that bad.

1038
00:42:26,330 --> 00:42:26,770
Okay.

1039
00:42:27,430 --> 00:42:28,750
I didn't fuck up too much.

1040
00:42:31,230 --> 00:42:32,330
I got scared there.

1041
00:42:32,790 --> 00:42:33,850
Oh god, here we go.

1042
00:42:36,290 --> 00:42:36,730
Okay.

1043
00:42:40,390 --> 00:42:40,830
Okay.

1044
00:42:40,910 --> 00:42:41,130
Okay.

1045
00:42:41,770 --> 00:42:43,270
Almost scared myself there.

1046
00:42:44,870 --> 00:42:45,310
Okay.

1047
00:42:46,010 --> 00:42:47,510
I've refilled that stamina!

1048
00:42:48,890 --> 00:42:49,330
Oh.

1049
00:42:49,330 --> 00:42:49,770
Okay.

1050
00:42:50,670 --> 00:42:51,110
But...

1051
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:53,610
There is an ending chat!

1052
00:42:58,330 --> 00:42:58,890
Oh my god.

1053
00:42:58,890 --> 00:43:00,430
The fact that there is an ending...

1054
00:43:00,430 --> 00:43:02,390
gives me so much hope!

1055
00:43:06,870 --> 00:43:08,250
Oh my god.

1056
00:43:08,410 --> 00:43:08,570
Oh my god.

1057
00:43:08,730 --> 00:43:09,290
Oh my god.

1058
00:43:09,290 --> 00:43:10,370
There is an end...

1059
00:43:10,370 --> 00:43:11,550
to this madness.

1060
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:19,960
Oh my god.

1061
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:21,760
Oh, I don't like that...

1062
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:23,340
numbers are going up.

1063
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:26,920
Oh no.

1064
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:29,420
I don't like that.

1065
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:30,700
I don't...

1066
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:34,340
Oh no.

1067
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:36,400
Please help me.

1068
00:43:36,620 --> 00:43:38,280
I can be middle of the pack.

1069
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:39,160
Please.

1070
00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:41,500
Let me be the middle of the pack.

1071
00:43:44,180 --> 00:43:45,440
That's all I ask.

1072
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:49,240
Oh god.

1073
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:50,480
Oh god.

1074
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:51,100
Where is everybody?

1075
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:54,520
Oh, 58.

1076
00:43:54,780 --> 00:43:57,820
Oh, the numbers are increasing, guys!

1077
00:43:58,780 --> 00:43:59,300
Guys!

1078
00:43:59,300 --> 00:43:59,400
Guys!

1079
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:02,280
Oh!

1080
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:03,100
Oh.

1081
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:04,860
Wait...

1082
00:44:04,860 --> 00:44:05,360
Is that it?

1083
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:08,880
Is that the end?!

1084
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:11,060
Is that it?!

1085
00:44:11,060 --> 00:44:12,620
Oh, I'm 70'1!

1086
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:14,600
Let's fucking go!

1087
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:16,220
Oh!

1088
00:44:16,460 --> 00:44:17,960
I made it!

1089
00:44:18,460 --> 00:44:19,640
Oh my god.

1090
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:25,140
Oh, I made it.

1091
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:26,360
Oh.

1092
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:28,020
Okay.

1093
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:31,780
Okay, we had a very scuffed start.

1094
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:36,500
We had an incredibly scuffed start, but we still lived.

1095
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:44,840
The start... definitely could be improved by a lot.

1096
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:54,780
Yeah, we had a very rough time there.

1097
00:44:55,020 --> 00:44:57,060
That was pretty fucking rough.

1098
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,220
No more F5 chat, we've learned.

1099
00:45:02,380 --> 00:45:05,120
No more fucking F5 for us.

1100
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:08,660
I was so stressed out.

1101
00:45:08,860 --> 00:45:11,480
I was so fucking stressed out there.

1102
00:45:11,860 --> 00:45:13,760
My hands were literally shaking.

1103
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:18,800
Now they have to eliminate five more.

1104
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:21,100
Oh god, I just can't be the last five.

1105
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:24,960
If I live... if I... I just can't be the last five.

1106
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:26,340
I didn't mess up the parkour!

1107
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:27,560
So we're okay.

1108
00:45:29,420 --> 00:45:29,980
Oh my god.

1109
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:31,180
My heart.

1110
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:32,900
My heart can't take these games.

1111
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:34,580
Hey, Gumi's behind me?

1112
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:35,840
Where is she?

1113
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:39,120
Where is she?

1114
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:40,820
I don't see her.

1115
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:41,900
You liars!

1116
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:44,380
You liars!

1117
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:46,980
Ugh, it's fine.

1118
00:45:53,910 --> 00:46:00,050
I'm just happy that I was 70, so I was in the middle of the pack.

1119
00:46:00,050 --> 00:46:01,550
Wait, she's right there?

1120
00:46:02,250 --> 00:46:02,730
Where?

1121
00:46:03,210 --> 00:46:05,830
I have the... I have it turned off because I took my meds today.

1122
00:46:06,130 --> 00:46:08,170
So I don't hear the voices at the moment.

1123
00:46:10,770 --> 00:46:12,130
Um, you'll hear her?

1124
00:46:12,270 --> 00:46:13,050
Guys, I don't know.

1125
00:46:14,110 --> 00:46:17,730
I might hear her, but I'll also hear 30 other voices.

1126
00:46:19,510 --> 00:46:20,570
So I don't know.

1127
00:46:21,070 --> 00:46:22,210
I don't know, guys.

1128
00:46:22,390 --> 00:46:25,110
I don't really want to hear 30 other voices.

1129
00:46:26,390 --> 00:46:27,510
The dark corner.

1130
00:46:28,450 --> 00:46:28,930
Okay.

1131
00:46:30,410 --> 00:46:31,290
Dark corner?

1132
00:46:32,250 --> 00:46:32,730
Where?

1133
00:46:36,150 --> 00:46:38,130
I'm trying to like... Okay.

1134
00:46:38,270 --> 00:46:40,110
And then I have to like let go of W.

1135
00:46:40,190 --> 00:46:43,490
Okay, I'm trying to like remember how to like look at my...

1136
00:46:44,050 --> 00:46:44,850
I passed it?

1137
00:46:46,450 --> 00:46:47,210
Oh my god.

1138
00:46:47,350 --> 00:46:48,410
I can't find her!

1139
00:46:50,570 --> 00:46:51,550
Where is she?

1140
00:46:53,130 --> 00:46:53,890
Are you sure?

1141
00:46:54,310 --> 00:46:56,850
Are you guys... Did you guys take your meds?

1142
00:46:59,110 --> 00:47:00,270
Right of the door.

1143
00:47:00,350 --> 00:47:01,150
Oh, this is right.

1144
00:47:01,210 --> 00:47:02,270
Oh, here she is!

1145
00:47:05,210 --> 00:47:05,610
Hello?

1146
00:47:06,030 --> 00:47:06,510
Who me?

1147
00:47:06,710 --> 00:47:08,470
Oh, now you want to look at me, you stupid...

1148
00:47:08,470 --> 00:47:09,810
I could... I had it muted!

1149
00:47:09,830 --> 00:47:11,470
I couldn't find... I muted the voice!

1150
00:47:11,550 --> 00:47:11,950
I was right!

1151
00:47:12,050 --> 00:47:13,770
I ran in front of you twice!

1152
00:47:13,870 --> 00:47:14,970
I ran in front of you twice!

1153
00:47:14,970 --> 00:47:16,030
I took my meds.

1154
00:47:16,030 --> 00:47:16,310
Sorry.

1155
00:47:16,430 --> 00:47:17,990
So I couldn't hear the voices anymore.

1156
00:47:18,930 --> 00:47:20,550
I wasn't even talking to you.

1157
00:47:20,550 --> 00:47:22,130
I ran in front of you.

1158
00:47:23,210 --> 00:47:24,670
I'm bl... You know I'm blind!

1159
00:47:26,490 --> 00:47:27,810
I appreciate you.

1160
00:47:27,810 --> 00:47:28,430
You know that!

1161
00:47:29,150 --> 00:47:30,950
You turned away from me twice!

1162
00:47:31,470 --> 00:47:32,850
Okay, I don't know about that.

1163
00:47:32,990 --> 00:47:33,850
I don't remember that.

1164
00:47:34,330 --> 00:47:34,750
Oh, I muted.

1165
00:47:34,850 --> 00:47:35,670
I realized I was muted.

1166
00:47:35,750 --> 00:47:35,910
I did.

1167
00:47:35,910 --> 00:47:36,670
Your chat probably does.

1168
00:47:36,890 --> 00:47:39,950
Okay, my... Yes, my chat was telling me where you are and I was lost.

1169
00:47:40,050 --> 00:47:40,990
I kept looking around.

1170
00:47:41,230 --> 00:47:41,890
Okay, take a break.

1171
00:47:41,910 --> 00:47:42,930
You're hiding in the corner!

1172
00:47:43,670 --> 00:47:44,790
How am I supposed to see that?

1173
00:47:45,010 --> 00:47:45,410
You know what?

1174
00:47:45,430 --> 00:47:46,770
You were running around right here.

1175
00:47:47,590 --> 00:47:47,950
Yeah?

1176
00:47:48,190 --> 00:47:49,530
You were running back and forth here.

1177
00:47:50,490 --> 00:47:52,950
And then you... You just turned away.

1178
00:47:52,970 --> 00:47:53,490
I was like, you know what?

1179
00:47:53,490 --> 00:47:53,770
I'm done.

1180
00:47:55,610 --> 00:47:57,070
I don't know!

1181
00:47:57,350 --> 00:47:58,710
You were in the corner!

1182
00:47:58,950 --> 00:48:00,190
How was I supposed to know?

1183
00:48:00,430 --> 00:48:01,510
Doki, what points did you get?

1184
00:48:01,570 --> 00:48:02,390
I got 20 first.

1185
00:48:03,590 --> 00:48:08,210
I... I made a mistake by having F5 and I bumped into everything.

1186
00:48:08,810 --> 00:48:09,450
I appreciate you.

1187
00:48:09,870 --> 00:48:10,350
Hey.

1188
00:48:10,630 --> 00:48:10,990
Hey.

1189
00:48:11,670 --> 00:48:14,950
I was like 70 something, so I was like in the middle of the pack.

1190
00:48:15,290 --> 00:48:16,150
Hey, not last.

1191
00:48:16,390 --> 00:48:17,070
Yeah, not last.

1192
00:48:17,090 --> 00:48:18,670
I was alone by myself for a while.

1193
00:48:19,030 --> 00:48:19,830
Wait, really?

1194
00:48:20,350 --> 00:48:20,690
That's scary.

1195
00:48:21,030 --> 00:48:21,750
That's scary.

1196
00:48:21,930 --> 00:48:22,350
That's spooky.

1197
00:48:22,370 --> 00:48:23,950
I didn't get caught by the monsters though.

1198
00:48:24,930 --> 00:48:31,090
I didn't get caught either, but I went on the right path to the monster and everyone went left, so I was all alone.

1199
00:48:31,770 --> 00:48:32,590
Monster on the loose.

1200
00:48:34,010 --> 00:48:34,330
Yeah.

1201
00:48:34,490 --> 00:48:36,770
Yeah, that was so scary when the monsters were chasing.

1202
00:48:37,910 --> 00:48:39,250
The dog one was scary.

1203
00:48:39,290 --> 00:48:40,370
The one on all fours.

1204
00:48:40,370 --> 00:48:41,750
Oh yeah, that guy was huge!

1205
00:48:43,950 --> 00:48:46,530
Honestly, I made shatter go in front of me because I was scared.

1206
00:48:47,130 --> 00:48:48,230
There was a couple people waiting.

1207
00:48:48,290 --> 00:48:49,470
I was just like, I'm just gonna run at it.

1208
00:48:50,430 --> 00:48:52,130
Wait, did you... Wait, you ran at it?

1209
00:48:52,190 --> 00:48:52,790
How did you live?

1210
00:48:54,130 --> 00:48:59,590
If you have full stamina, if you just run past it, usually once it aggroes you, it won't be able to chase you for long enough.

1211
00:48:59,790 --> 00:49:00,890
Oh my god, it's so smart.

1212
00:49:01,350 --> 00:49:02,030
Minecraft tech.

1213
00:49:02,450 --> 00:49:03,810
It has like an area of...

1214
00:49:03,810 --> 00:49:05,570
Guys, why couldn't you give me that Minecraft tech?

1215
00:49:07,010 --> 00:49:08,770
Like if the end was like over there...

1216
00:49:08,770 --> 00:49:10,130
There's so many of you.

1217
00:49:10,170 --> 00:49:11,950
Why have you guys could have given me that advice?

1218
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:13,770
One last person.

1219
00:49:14,110 --> 00:49:14,990
One last person.

1220
00:49:15,070 --> 00:49:17,570
That must be so like scary.

1221
00:49:18,430 --> 00:49:18,750
Like...

1222
00:49:18,750 --> 00:49:18,890
Yeah.

1223
00:49:19,470 --> 00:49:20,030
Okay, no.

1224
00:49:20,130 --> 00:49:22,990
When everyone started coming into the game, I was like, oh my god, I'm all alone.

1225
00:49:24,990 --> 00:49:26,150
Who got eliminated?

1226
00:49:27,170 --> 00:49:28,310
Well, good to see you.

1227
00:49:28,630 --> 00:49:31,950
I feel like it's so embarrassing that they put your name up at the top.

1228
00:49:32,310 --> 00:49:34,550
Oh, Darryl, this guy got eliminated.

1229
00:49:34,550 --> 00:49:35,070
Oh no.

1230
00:49:35,490 --> 00:49:37,810
Look at those people getting eliminated.

1231
00:49:38,810 --> 00:49:39,430
Not us.

1232
00:49:39,430 --> 00:49:40,170
Sucks to be them, right?

1233
00:49:40,890 --> 00:49:42,290
As long as it's not us.

1234
00:49:42,590 --> 00:49:43,810
See that person?

1235
00:49:43,990 --> 00:49:45,970
I could have picked them up and I didn't.

1236
00:49:45,990 --> 00:49:46,650
Let's go.

1237
00:49:46,910 --> 00:49:47,890
High fives.

1238
00:49:48,290 --> 00:49:49,610
High fives.

1239
00:49:49,610 --> 00:49:50,130
Up top.

1240
00:49:50,570 --> 00:49:51,010
Up top.

1241
00:49:51,010 --> 00:49:51,690
Up top.

1242
00:49:51,890 --> 00:49:52,330
Yeah.

1243
00:49:52,410 --> 00:49:52,870
Are you...

1244
00:49:52,870 --> 00:49:55,070
Maybe you are a bad boy.

1245
00:49:55,190 --> 00:49:56,650
I am.

1246
00:49:57,610 --> 00:49:59,590
I didn't pick up any randoms.

1247
00:50:00,170 --> 00:50:03,010
Wait, if it was me, would you pick me up?

1248
00:50:03,170 --> 00:50:04,750
Yeah, if it was you, I would.

1249
00:50:04,810 --> 00:50:06,210
I would be behind you.

1250
00:50:06,290 --> 00:50:07,270
You have to turn around.

1251
00:50:08,370 --> 00:50:09,610
You're all not turning around.

1252
00:50:10,150 --> 00:50:12,030
You're not turning around for me?

1253
00:50:13,110 --> 00:50:14,270
I'll pick you up.

1254
00:50:14,510 --> 00:50:15,390
See, okay, wait.

1255
00:50:15,490 --> 00:50:17,470
Yeah, I will do it.

1256
00:50:19,050 --> 00:50:20,070
Everyone's like, you're both me.

1257
00:50:20,150 --> 00:50:21,950
Well, Dokie, here's the problem.

1258
00:50:22,870 --> 00:50:25,190
I think all of us are usually ahead of you.

1259
00:50:25,610 --> 00:50:27,310
Yeah, yeah, but you'll turn around, right?

1260
00:50:28,190 --> 00:50:28,630
Yeah.

1261
00:50:29,130 --> 00:50:30,990
Yeah, you'll turn around, right?

1262
00:50:31,090 --> 00:50:31,430
Yeah.

1263
00:50:32,690 --> 00:50:35,570
Girl, how are you gonna...

1264
00:50:35,570 --> 00:50:39,950
I'm gonna call you on Discord if you don't pick me up.

1265
00:50:39,970 --> 00:50:41,930
I'm on Do Not Disturb at all times.

1266
00:50:42,910 --> 00:50:44,210
You have my phone number.

1267
00:50:44,290 --> 00:50:44,510
Maybe you have my phone number.

1268
00:50:44,510 --> 00:50:46,910
Yeah, I'll call you on your number.

1269
00:50:47,530 --> 00:50:48,610
It's very...

1270
00:50:49,910 --> 00:50:50,750
Just remember.

1271
00:50:51,550 --> 00:50:52,850
I'll call you on your phone number.

1272
00:50:52,850 --> 00:50:54,290
I'll call you on your phone number to pick me up.

1273
00:50:55,490 --> 00:50:57,330
This game gives me anxiety.

1274
00:50:57,650 --> 00:50:58,170
I hate you.

1275
00:50:59,650 --> 00:51:00,850
I'm gonna mute again.

1276
00:51:00,930 --> 00:51:01,910
There's too many voices.

1277
00:51:02,430 --> 00:51:03,650
Dude, just come over here.

1278
00:51:04,030 --> 00:51:05,990
Yeah, but the gates.

1279
00:51:07,610 --> 00:51:08,590
There's three minutes.

1280
00:51:08,630 --> 00:51:09,170
Look at the timer.

1281
00:51:09,290 --> 00:51:09,710
Three minutes.

1282
00:51:09,870 --> 00:51:10,750
But the gates.

1283
00:51:12,230 --> 00:51:13,090
Show mama.

1284
00:51:13,430 --> 00:51:14,210
Oh, whoa.

1285
00:51:16,750 --> 00:51:17,650
Is that nice?

1286
00:51:17,650 --> 00:51:17,910
Is that nice?

1287
00:51:17,970 --> 00:51:20,850
Is that nice?

1288
00:51:20,850 --> 00:51:21,070
Oh my god.

1289
00:51:21,090 --> 00:51:23,510
That parkour shit stressed me out so much.

1290
00:51:23,790 --> 00:51:25,710
It was so... My hands were shaking.

1291
00:51:27,070 --> 00:51:31,430
Oh, I just stopped sprinting after each jump and then I had full stamina the entire time.

1292
00:51:31,870 --> 00:51:34,210
Yeah, like, I don't believe... It was just so stressful.

1293
00:51:34,410 --> 00:51:35,710
Were you F5-ing the entire time?

1294
00:51:35,730 --> 00:51:36,130
Is that why?

1295
00:51:36,390 --> 00:51:36,770
No.

1296
00:51:37,010 --> 00:51:38,790
I was like... I was first person.

1297
00:51:38,970 --> 00:51:39,750
You're supposed to be playing F5.

1298
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:44,190
After I played it F5 in the beginning, it was such a mess because I couldn't see where I am.

1299
00:51:44,250 --> 00:51:45,410
So I just played first person.

1300
00:51:45,590 --> 00:51:45,750
You're about to get scrambled.

1301
00:51:45,770 --> 00:51:46,430
I'm sorry about that.

1302
00:51:46,470 --> 00:51:47,050
That's what I'm saying.

1303
00:51:47,050 --> 00:51:50,650
I felt... I feel like this one, this next one, or the last one will have a lot more monsters.

1304
00:51:50,650 --> 00:51:52,950
Because I feel like this one was parkour heavy.

1305
00:51:53,290 --> 00:51:53,730
Yeah.

1306
00:51:53,730 --> 00:51:54,850
Yeah, 100%.

1307
00:51:55,330 --> 00:52:01,170
I'm pretty sure this one is also parkour because there was like the one with the lava in the cutscene.

1308
00:52:01,170 --> 00:52:01,610
We already did the lava.

1309
00:52:01,890 --> 00:52:02,470
No, no.

1310
00:52:02,490 --> 00:52:03,490
The full lava though.

1311
00:52:03,730 --> 00:52:05,870
There was like a lot more lava though, wasn't it?

1312
00:52:06,230 --> 00:52:06,670
Yeah.

1313
00:52:07,730 --> 00:52:08,610
I feel like we just did the one.

1314
00:52:08,870 --> 00:52:14,170
I feel like I didn't see the other lava area but maybe.

1315
00:52:14,670 --> 00:52:16,110
I am Dr. Gluon.

1316
00:52:16,230 --> 00:52:18,570
How many people are you eliminating for this one?

1317
00:52:19,730 --> 00:52:20,450
10 in total.

1318
00:52:20,450 --> 00:52:23,270
So they're eliminating 2 each safety round.

1319
00:52:23,410 --> 00:52:25,230
Oh, so this one is 2 then.

1320
00:52:25,270 --> 00:52:25,710
They're 2.

1321
00:52:26,470 --> 00:52:26,910
Yeah.

1322
00:52:26,930 --> 00:52:28,890
So 4 people have been eliminated already.

1323
00:52:29,270 --> 00:52:30,650
Oh, so there... Oh, okay.

1324
00:52:30,690 --> 00:52:31,030
Never mind.

1325
00:52:31,130 --> 00:52:31,410
6.

1326
00:52:31,630 --> 00:52:32,730
It might be 8 people.

1327
00:52:33,490 --> 00:52:33,930
8?

1328
00:52:34,110 --> 00:52:34,550
Guys.

1329
00:52:36,350 --> 00:52:40,630
Do you automatically get up if no one picks you up or are you stuck down?

1330
00:52:40,630 --> 00:52:41,170
I think so.

1331
00:52:41,370 --> 00:52:42,190
I think so.

1332
00:52:42,190 --> 00:52:43,110
So rezzing only takes a while.

1333
00:52:43,110 --> 00:52:43,830
It just takes a while.

1334
00:52:44,470 --> 00:52:44,910
Yeah.

1335
00:52:45,110 --> 00:52:47,830
So we can just leave people behind then.

1336
00:52:48,050 --> 00:52:48,490
No.

1337
00:52:48,590 --> 00:52:49,690
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1338
00:52:49,690 --> 00:52:52,850
You leave certain people behind.

1339
00:52:53,050 --> 00:52:54,270
But you'll pick me up, right?

1340
00:52:54,690 --> 00:52:57,510
Certain people leave behind certain people pick up.

1341
00:52:57,610 --> 00:52:57,770
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1342
00:52:57,830 --> 00:52:58,630
Certain people.

1343
00:52:58,710 --> 00:53:00,270
Yeah, leaving certain people behind.

1344
00:53:00,270 --> 00:53:01,070
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1345
00:53:01,070 --> 00:53:01,830
But not us.

1346
00:53:01,850 --> 00:53:02,850
Certain people behind.

1347
00:53:02,930 --> 00:53:03,510
Not us.

1348
00:53:03,510 --> 00:53:06,830
If you don't pick me up, Gumi will be mad.

1349
00:53:07,810 --> 00:53:08,210
Alright.

1350
00:53:08,210 --> 00:53:09,310
Is that true, Gumi?

1351
00:53:10,290 --> 00:53:10,690
Gumi?

1352
00:53:12,170 --> 00:53:13,330
Gumi, we're a package deal.

1353
00:53:13,390 --> 00:53:14,690
You said we're a package deal, Gumi.

1354
00:53:14,830 --> 00:53:15,150
What happened?

1355
00:53:15,170 --> 00:53:15,550
Alright.

1356
00:53:15,550 --> 00:53:17,430
I think I understand what's going on now.

1357
00:53:17,430 --> 00:53:18,030
I'm just nodding.

1358
00:53:18,070 --> 00:53:18,310
I'm nodding.

1359
00:53:18,310 --> 00:53:19,430
Don't get betrayed by them.

1360
00:53:19,570 --> 00:53:21,610
I just heard something and that's all I hear.

1361
00:53:21,830 --> 00:53:22,890
Don't get betrayed by them.

1362
00:53:23,410 --> 00:53:23,790
Got it.

1363
00:53:23,990 --> 00:53:26,310
Don't get betrayed.

1364
00:53:26,370 --> 00:53:26,790
Betray.

1365
00:53:27,170 --> 00:53:28,150
Don't get betrayed.

1366
00:53:28,150 --> 00:53:28,150
Betray.

1367
00:53:28,150 --> 00:53:28,150
Don't get betrayed.

1368
00:53:28,290 --> 00:53:28,730
Betray.

1369
00:53:28,790 --> 00:53:29,850
Don't get someone that says he's betraying us, 5-1-1.

1370
00:53:29,850 --> 00:53:32,250
Yeah, that's the one that says he's not gonna raise us.

1371
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:34,210
I'm not picking up certain people.

1372
00:53:34,390 --> 00:53:34,830
Wow.

1373
00:53:34,830 --> 00:53:36,550
Well, we know who we're not trusting.

1374
00:53:37,650 --> 00:53:38,090
Got it.

1375
00:53:38,150 --> 00:53:39,170
Don't get betrayed.

1376
00:53:39,350 --> 00:53:39,770
Betray.

1377
00:53:40,010 --> 00:53:41,290
I misheard the overhearing.

1378
00:53:41,890 --> 00:53:42,330
No.

1379
00:53:43,270 --> 00:53:44,790
They're telling me to save them.

1380
00:53:44,910 --> 00:53:45,570
Oh, yeah.

1381
00:53:45,670 --> 00:53:46,610
We should head over.

1382
00:53:46,610 --> 00:53:47,070
Right on.

1383
00:53:48,730 --> 00:53:49,170
Alright.

1384
00:53:49,170 --> 00:53:50,650
Now I took my meds again.

1385
00:53:51,330 --> 00:53:52,210
Pure silence.

1386
00:53:59,530 --> 00:54:00,070
It's okay.

1387
00:54:00,810 --> 00:54:02,710
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah.

1388
00:54:02,910 --> 00:54:03,950
I see your colors.

1389
00:54:04,130 --> 00:54:05,650
Maybe I took the wrong meds.

1390
00:54:11,690 --> 00:54:13,730
Guys, I think I took the wrong one.

1391
00:54:18,010 --> 00:54:19,130
Where am I?

1392
00:54:20,370 --> 00:54:22,870
Where am I?!

1393
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:28,020
Wait.

1394
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:29,600
Wait.

1395
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:31,520
Where did that go?

1396
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:36,600
I guess here?

1397
00:54:39,740 --> 00:54:40,240
Oh, god.

1398
00:54:40,300 --> 00:54:40,900
I can't see.

1399
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:44,020
Oh, god.

1400
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:47,440
I'm scared.

1401
00:54:51,140 --> 00:54:52,460
Oh my god, where am I?

1402
00:54:55,220 --> 00:54:56,140
Oh my god.

1403
00:54:57,280 --> 00:54:59,820
I hope front was the right way to go.

1404
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:01,500
That's what I hope for.

1405
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:03,880
I'm not using all my stamina guys!

1406
00:55:04,060 --> 00:55:05,100
I'm actually learning!

1407
00:55:07,820 --> 00:55:08,980
Oh my god.

1408
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:10,220
Oh my god, who was that?

1409
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:11,600
Who was that?

1410
00:55:12,540 --> 00:55:13,520
Who was that guys?

1411
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:14,840
Don't look behind.

1412
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:18,360
If you don't turn around and look, you won't get hurt.

1413
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:20,880
Guys, I can learn.

1414
00:55:21,220 --> 00:55:22,440
I told you guys.

1415
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:25,020
I told you guys I can learn.

1416
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:26,640
I figured it out guys!

1417
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:28,780
I figured out how to conserve my stamina!

1418
00:55:31,340 --> 00:55:35,080
If I let go all the buttons, eventually I'll be able to learn.

1419
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:35,820
I'll have my stamina.

1420
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:40,960
Eventually I stopped guys.

1421
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:43,200
I just gotta let everything go.

1422
00:55:45,620 --> 00:55:46,020
Okay.

1423
00:55:46,020 --> 00:55:46,900
What the fuck?

1424
00:55:47,580 --> 00:55:48,240
Oh god.

1425
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,660
Oh, I hear people behind me!

1426
00:55:52,780 --> 00:55:54,040
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1427
00:55:54,680 --> 00:55:55,240
It's okay.

1428
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:56,000
It's okay.

1429
00:55:56,540 --> 00:55:58,200
There's so many people that got caught.

1430
00:55:58,360 --> 00:55:59,540
I didn't even see the monster!

1431
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:01,460
That was the scary part!

1432
00:56:02,980 --> 00:56:04,920
I didn't even see the monster there!

1433
00:56:06,220 --> 00:56:06,740
Yay!

1434
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:09,600
Conserving my stamina.

1435
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:11,420
Oh!

1436
00:56:12,260 --> 00:56:13,000
We're okay.

1437
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:17,060
Guys, it only took two safe zones to learn how to play this game.

1438
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:18,700
God, Minecraft is so easy.

1439
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:19,840
A fucking game for babies.

1440
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:21,680
Sorry!

1441
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:26,480
Holy shit!

1442
00:56:26,660 --> 00:56:28,880
I think somebody died in front of me!

1443
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:30,740
I think I think so!

1444
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:31,920
Holy shit!

1445
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:33,060
Oh my god!

1446
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:36,920
I'm pretty sure someone literally died in front of me!

1447
00:56:37,100 --> 00:56:39,340
Oh my god, that was so close!

1448
00:56:39,900 --> 00:56:43,560
Holy fuck, that was actually so close!

1449
00:56:44,060 --> 00:56:45,220
Holy shit!

1450
00:56:45,740 --> 00:56:47,840
Guys, I think... It's okay.

1451
00:56:47,980 --> 00:56:48,340
We're okay.

1452
00:56:48,860 --> 00:56:50,460
Watch your tone!

1453
00:56:51,060 --> 00:56:52,520
Don't ever call Minecraft.

1454
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:54,460
I'm sorry, Minecraft's not a game for babies.

1455
00:56:54,560 --> 00:56:55,100
I'm so sorry.

1456
00:56:55,300 --> 00:56:57,060
It's a game for adults.

1457
00:56:58,160 --> 00:56:58,800
Clip.

1458
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:01,080
It's a game for adults.

1459
00:57:01,700 --> 00:57:03,680
For 18 plus and over.

1460
00:57:03,940 --> 00:57:05,620
But like not that type of...

1461
00:57:05,620 --> 00:57:09,920
But not that...

1462
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:11,200
I'm 18!

1463
00:57:12,120 --> 00:57:13,500
I did it!

1464
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:15,580
Oh my god!

1465
00:57:16,380 --> 00:57:18,160
I was ahead of coming!

1466
00:57:20,620 --> 00:57:21,580
Oh shit.

1467
00:57:23,180 --> 00:57:25,160
I was ahead of you!

1468
00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:26,020
That's what I'm talking about!

1469
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:27,300
You did it!

1470
00:57:27,300 --> 00:57:27,720
Doki!

1471
00:57:27,720 --> 00:57:28,880
I was ahead of you!

1472
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:30,380
Let's go!

1473
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:31,840
No, Doki!

1474
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:33,060
I've been standing here!

1475
00:57:33,460 --> 00:57:34,680
No, I got you!

1476
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:35,400
I'm ahead of you!

1477
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:37,700
No, I've been standing here!

1478
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:38,220
I'm ahead of you!

1479
00:57:39,340 --> 00:57:40,180
Mama mia!

1480
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:40,880
Oh my god!

1481
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:41,500
Oh my god!

1482
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:42,420
I did it, guys!

1483
00:57:42,940 --> 00:57:44,780
We fucking did it!

1484
00:57:45,380 --> 00:57:46,840
We're so good!

1485
00:57:47,100 --> 00:57:48,460
We're so good!

1486
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:50,400
18!

1487
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:51,780
Let's go!

1488
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:55,000
Oh my god!

1489
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,780
Guys, is this what it's like to be a fucking winner?

1490
00:58:02,820 --> 00:58:04,140
Oh my god!

1491
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:06,560
I'm a... winner?

1492
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:09,780
Not last!

1493
00:58:09,940 --> 00:58:10,820
Let's go!

1494
00:58:13,700 --> 00:58:15,520
Oh my god, guys!

1495
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:17,500
Oh, Warren TV!

1496
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:18,400
Yeah, fuck you!

1497
00:58:18,500 --> 00:58:20,580
You fucked me over yesterday!

1498
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:23,260
Yeah, that's right, Warren TV!

1499
00:58:23,980 --> 00:58:26,040
You fucked... you lied to me yesterday!

1500
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:27,680
That's called karma!

1501
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:32,360
Oh my god!

1502
00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:35,320
I don't think I forgot about yesterday!

1503
00:58:37,060 --> 00:58:38,860
I'm a pro at Minecraft, dude.

1504
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:41,620
There you go.

1505
00:58:41,740 --> 00:58:43,260
I told you karma was gonna happen.

1506
00:58:43,780 --> 00:58:44,660
Karma's a bitch.

1507
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:51,560
Oh my god, I'm gonna wake up.

1508
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:52,660
I'm gonna wake up from this nightmare.

1509
00:58:57,150 --> 00:58:58,010
Oh my god.

1510
00:58:58,110 --> 00:58:58,450
Oh my god.

1511
00:58:58,450 --> 00:59:02,030
Why was this one so goddamn short compared to what we...

1512
00:59:02,030 --> 00:59:03,510
Like, what?

1513
00:59:04,410 --> 00:59:07,470
Why was this one so goddamn short?

1514
00:59:08,930 --> 00:59:09,450
Okay.

1515
00:59:11,430 --> 00:59:11,950
Alright.

1516
00:59:12,090 --> 00:59:14,250
Turning down master and bringing everything down.

1517
00:59:14,510 --> 00:59:16,210
Okay, we're gonna have to...

1518
00:59:16,210 --> 00:59:17,150
Uh...

1519
00:59:17,150 --> 00:59:22,310
Okay, we're gonna have to bring down the master volume, because we have no idea what is anything tied to.

1520
00:59:22,310 --> 00:59:23,410
What is the word?

1521
00:59:23,490 --> 00:59:26,010
Bring down the master volume.

1522
00:59:26,350 --> 00:59:31,190
We're like trying to figure out what is making the... like the ambient noises.

1523
00:59:33,030 --> 00:59:33,750
Um...

1524
00:59:33,750 --> 00:59:38,450
And like... what is making the ambient noises and the monsters.

1525
00:59:38,570 --> 00:59:41,310
So we've been trying to figure it out.

1526
00:59:41,470 --> 00:59:44,250
We've been turning everything down, but it's not working!

1527
00:59:47,130 --> 00:59:48,970
Like I don't understand.

1528
00:59:48,970 --> 00:59:51,310
Nothing was working!

1529
00:59:53,070 --> 00:59:53,530
Alright.

1530
00:59:54,890 --> 00:59:56,770
Okay, we're just gonna turn up the voice then.

1531
00:59:57,010 --> 00:59:57,470
Alright.

1532
00:59:57,890 --> 00:59:59,550
We tried the weather, right?

1533
01:00:01,070 --> 01:00:01,530
Maybe.

1534
01:00:01,630 --> 01:00:03,250
It could be the weather actually.

1535
01:00:03,610 --> 01:00:04,870
Okay, we're gonna turn the weather down.

1536
01:00:05,690 --> 01:00:06,150
But...

1537
01:00:06,150 --> 01:00:09,330
Is this volume too loud when we were playing?

1538
01:00:09,450 --> 01:00:10,130
I couldn't tell.

1539
01:00:10,970 --> 01:00:11,430
Honestly.

1540
01:00:13,010 --> 01:00:17,050
Because like, uh, sound guy was saying that the monsters were being too loud.

1541
01:00:17,870 --> 01:00:18,870
So I wasn't sure.

1542
01:00:23,020 --> 01:00:23,940
It was fine?

1543
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:25,420
Yeah, it was.

1544
01:00:25,420 --> 01:00:25,860
It's all over.

1545
01:00:25,980 --> 01:00:27,760
Yeah, it is pretty all over in the place.

1546
01:00:30,900 --> 01:00:31,340
Yeah.

1547
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:33,840
It was immersive.

1548
01:00:34,020 --> 01:00:34,400
True!

1549
01:00:34,780 --> 01:00:35,220
True.

1550
01:00:35,320 --> 01:00:36,100
It was immersive.

1551
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:37,560
It was so immersive.

1552
01:00:37,820 --> 01:00:38,240
Guys, see?

1553
01:00:38,580 --> 01:00:41,720
Every game we learn more about how to play this game.

1554
01:00:42,080 --> 01:00:43,920
We learn more and more about how to play.

1555
01:00:47,100 --> 01:00:48,280
We're getting better chat.

1556
01:00:49,220 --> 01:00:50,820
We're getting better at Minecraft.

1557
01:00:51,540 --> 01:00:54,100
Because Minecraft is not a baby game.

1558
01:00:54,220 --> 01:00:55,320
That was so fucked up.

1559
01:00:55,480 --> 01:00:56,260
I called...

1560
01:00:57,600 --> 01:01:03,160
I said somebody died in front of me the moment I called Minecraft a baby game.

1561
01:01:04,380 --> 01:01:06,100
That was so fucked up.

1562
01:01:06,140 --> 01:01:06,740
Like, I'm sorry.

1563
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:08,060
I didn't mean it.

1564
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:10,560
I didn't mean it.

1565
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:13,000
I was like, where did the monster come from?

1566
01:01:13,380 --> 01:01:13,920
Dude.

1567
01:01:14,340 --> 01:01:17,060
Yeah, Minecraft should be an eSport.

1568
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:19,140
There should be a Bed Wars eSport.

1569
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:21,180
The views will go up.

1570
01:01:21,180 --> 01:01:21,640
These are so insane.

1571
01:01:22,060 --> 01:01:24,560
God struck them for my sins.

1572
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:25,800
God...

1573
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:26,800
Okay, look, guys!

1574
01:01:26,900 --> 01:01:29,000
God's aim is a little bit wonky, guys.

1575
01:01:29,220 --> 01:01:29,720
Okay?

1576
01:01:29,860 --> 01:01:31,020
He's not a game...

1577
01:01:31,020 --> 01:01:32,480
God is not a gamer, guys.

1578
01:01:32,780 --> 01:01:33,180
Alright?

1579
01:01:33,300 --> 01:01:34,200
He sort of missed.

1580
01:01:37,140 --> 01:01:39,680
He just missed, okay?

1581
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:43,840
But he taught me a lesson.

1582
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:45,420
Now I know.

1583
01:01:45,900 --> 01:01:47,540
Never shit talk Minecraft.

1584
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:50,280
No, next game is like a puzzle.

1585
01:01:51,880 --> 01:01:53,140
It's a puzzle game.

1586
01:01:53,420 --> 01:01:57,640
So like, as long as... chat, you gotta help me backseat this, okay guys?

1587
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:02,420
Guys, you gotta... you gotta help me backseat.

1588
01:02:05,080 --> 01:02:07,000
Oh my god, he's still alive.

1589
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:12,740
I can't believe he's still alive.

1590
01:02:14,680 --> 01:02:15,660
Where's Groomie?

1591
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:17,460
Where's Groomie?

1592
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:19,660
We gotta combine our chats together.

1593
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:27,720
Because if we average our chat's IQs together, it'd be like 2 brain cells.

1594
01:02:28,080 --> 01:02:29,500
And include Groomie and I.

1595
01:02:29,660 --> 01:02:33,440
Because like, Groomie and I, we add our brains together, it'd be like 0.1.

1596
01:02:33,820 --> 01:02:38,000
But if we add your chat and my... like her chat and my chat together, it'd be like 2.

1597
01:02:38,820 --> 01:02:40,680
So you guys are like 1.8.

1598
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:48,180
Alright, we got... we can do this.

1599
01:02:48,460 --> 01:02:49,240
We can do this.

1600
01:02:49,660 --> 01:02:52,220
We put all our brains together, we can do this guys.

1601
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:55,900
There's no way.

1602
01:02:56,320 --> 01:02:59,680
Alright, let's see who has... look at all these dead bodies.

1603
01:03:00,060 --> 01:03:01,320
Oh my god.

1604
01:03:02,540 --> 01:03:05,400
Look at all these... that's me, I'm still alive, bitches.

1605
01:03:05,900 --> 01:03:06,880
I'm still alive.

1606
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:11,620
But Doki, we have no brains.

1607
01:03:11,820 --> 01:03:14,040
Yep, you have like 0.01%.

1608
01:03:14,660 --> 01:03:17,100
So you add it all together, it will be a 2.

1609
01:03:18,060 --> 01:03:19,000
Guys, it's a puzzle.

1610
01:03:19,660 --> 01:03:21,120
We know me and puzzles guys.

1611
01:03:21,460 --> 01:03:25,020
All you puzzle dragons who keep telling me to play a puzzle game.

1612
01:03:25,300 --> 01:03:27,800
This is your time to rise up.

1613
01:03:28,100 --> 01:03:28,600
Chat.

1614
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:33,880
Literally, whenever you guys are like, Doki, please play a puzzle game.

1615
01:03:34,040 --> 01:03:35,720
Play like those like IQ games.

1616
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:39,940
Guys, play that... play that IQ... like what was it?

1617
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:44,100
The one where you have to draw lines or whatever to like solve a puzzle... solve the puzzle?

1618
01:03:44,340 --> 01:03:49,480
This is your chance to rise up and backseat me.

1619
01:03:50,900 --> 01:03:53,300
Everyone's like, Doki, play a little to the left.

1620
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:54,400
Doki, play...

1621
01:03:57,380 --> 01:03:59,040
Doki, play a detective game.

1622
01:03:59,980 --> 01:04:00,420
Doki...

1623
01:04:03,340 --> 01:04:04,140
This is it.

1624
01:04:04,620 --> 01:04:06,580
This is literally your moment to shine.

1625
01:04:08,300 --> 01:04:10,600
I'm too lazy to do puzzles.

1626
01:04:13,740 --> 01:04:15,080
It's okay, we can do this.

1627
01:04:15,140 --> 01:04:15,560
I believe.

1628
01:04:16,380 --> 01:04:17,340
Like there's no way.

1629
01:04:17,880 --> 01:04:20,980
It's like we all work... we have... it's like each...

1630
01:04:20,980 --> 01:04:24,020
Some people don't even have a chat to help them, guys.

1631
01:04:24,100 --> 01:04:25,360
They have to use their own brains.

1632
01:04:26,460 --> 01:04:28,600
That's why... that's why we're working together.

1633
01:04:29,020 --> 01:04:30,940
We literally have chat advantage.

1634
01:04:31,380 --> 01:04:35,760
And like the best part is that... I'm sorry to all the Minecraft viewers.

1635
01:04:35,940 --> 01:04:36,960
Like it's not you guys.

1636
01:04:37,060 --> 01:04:39,860
Minecraft viewers that are watching me, this doesn't pertain to you.

1637
01:04:40,220 --> 01:04:42,300
This does not apply to you.

1638
01:04:42,360 --> 01:04:45,520
But what's the best part is that we're not Minecraft viewers.

1639
01:04:46,040 --> 01:04:46,760
Yeah, we're being lucky.

1640
01:04:46,760 --> 01:04:48,240
The main category is not Minecraft.

1641
01:04:48,580 --> 01:04:54,260
So the... so the average age of a dragoon is at least over 13.

1642
01:05:00,860 --> 01:05:06,160
So... we have a chance against the other Minecraft players.

1643
01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:13,800
So we can do it, guys.

1644
01:05:15,880 --> 01:05:18,920
But like if you're a Minecraft viewer and you're watching me, this doesn't apply to you.

1645
01:05:19,020 --> 01:05:20,040
Because you're watching me.

1646
01:05:20,120 --> 01:05:21,980
So your age is already like...

1647
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:23,400
Gumi.

1648
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:25,040
Gumi.

1649
01:05:25,360 --> 01:05:26,360
Wait, where are you, Gumi?

1650
01:05:27,600 --> 01:05:28,280
Oh, thanks.

1651
01:05:28,360 --> 01:05:28,560
Gumi?

1652
01:05:28,920 --> 01:05:29,180
Oh, wow.

1653
01:05:29,300 --> 01:05:29,840
It feels better.

1654
01:05:31,580 --> 01:05:32,020
Gumi?

1655
01:05:32,460 --> 01:05:33,280
Why did you do that?

1656
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:35,340
Where's Gumi?

1657
01:05:35,700 --> 01:05:37,220
Am I hearing voices again?

1658
01:05:38,120 --> 01:05:38,760
Am I...

1659
01:05:38,760 --> 01:05:40,220
Am I...

1660
01:05:41,080 --> 01:05:42,680
Am I hearing voices?

1661
01:05:43,880 --> 01:05:44,940
Where did Gumi go?

1662
01:05:47,840 --> 01:05:50,240
I think the next game is the Simon Says one.

1663
01:05:51,380 --> 01:05:52,440
Where is she?

1664
01:05:56,040 --> 01:05:57,840
Did I... did I imagine that?

1665
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:00,540
You guys heard it too, right?

1666
01:06:01,560 --> 01:06:02,720
You guys heard it?

1667
01:06:04,840 --> 01:06:06,520
You guys heard that voice, right?

1668
01:06:08,720 --> 01:06:10,600
Did you not hear what I heard?

1669
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:11,340
Guys.

1670
01:06:11,340 --> 01:06:14,980
Did you not hear... hear... Gumi?

1671
01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:17,120
No.

1672
01:06:19,340 --> 01:06:19,580
Oh, no.

1673
01:06:19,800 --> 01:06:21,100
Guys, I think I'm...

1674
01:06:21,100 --> 01:06:22,300
Oh, Gumi!

1675
01:06:23,720 --> 01:06:24,240
Gumi!

1676
01:06:24,420 --> 01:06:25,780
I see you running, Gumi.

1677
01:06:25,880 --> 01:06:26,580
I know you're there.

1678
01:06:27,260 --> 01:06:29,200
I know you're in front of me, Gumi.

1679
01:06:30,820 --> 01:06:31,940
Gumi, where are you going?

1680
01:06:34,220 --> 01:06:34,740
Gumi?

1681
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:37,440
She's losing...

1682
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:37,800
Gumi.

1683
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:38,500
Gumi?

1684
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:40,960
Gumi, where are you doing?

1685
01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:42,500
Gumi?

1686
01:06:42,500 --> 01:06:42,980
Gumi!

1687
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:46,300
Why did you catch up so fast?

1688
01:06:46,720 --> 01:06:47,260
I did it.

1689
01:06:47,320 --> 01:06:48,400
I learned the Minecraft tech.

1690
01:06:48,580 --> 01:06:50,020
I was 18 plays.

1691
01:06:50,220 --> 01:06:51,060
Are you proud of me?

1692
01:06:51,520 --> 01:06:52,720
I am proud.

1693
01:06:52,740 --> 01:06:53,680
I was ahead of you.

1694
01:06:55,020 --> 01:06:55,560
Yeah.

1695
01:06:56,120 --> 01:06:57,120
Are you proud of me?

1696
01:06:57,160 --> 01:06:58,440
I became the master.

1697
01:06:58,720 --> 01:06:59,100
I am proud.

1698
01:06:59,500 --> 01:06:59,940
I am.

1699
01:07:00,440 --> 01:07:02,880
I only took you two save points.

1700
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:04,460
Two save points.

1701
01:07:05,040 --> 01:07:05,720
We need...

1702
01:07:05,720 --> 01:07:06,360
We need...

1703
01:07:06,360 --> 01:07:08,140
We need to do puzzles.

1704
01:07:08,140 --> 01:07:08,900
Yeah, yeah.

1705
01:07:08,920 --> 01:07:12,140
So your chat and my chat can work together in solving this puzzle.

1706
01:07:14,020 --> 01:07:14,500
Right?

1707
01:07:15,560 --> 01:07:16,360
Yeah, yeah.

1708
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:20,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1709
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:24,080
Yeah, so we can backseat.

1710
01:07:24,680 --> 01:07:27,460
Oh, and then like, if our chat can look at...

1711
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:31,380
No, no, no.

1712
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:35,180
No, I already know what you're gonna say.

1713
01:07:37,260 --> 01:07:38,640
I mean, people are ahead of us.

1714
01:07:43,800 --> 01:07:45,020
The two in this room over here?

1715
01:07:45,780 --> 01:07:46,640
It's a joke, guys.

1716
01:07:46,740 --> 01:07:48,280
Guys, if you guys didn't know, that's a joke, guys.

1717
01:07:48,560 --> 01:07:49,840
It's a disclaimer.

1718
01:07:50,200 --> 01:07:50,940
Don't do it.

1719
01:07:50,940 --> 01:07:51,580
Don't do it.

1720
01:07:51,720 --> 01:07:51,880
Don't do it.

1721
01:07:51,880 --> 01:07:52,860
It's a joke, guys.

1722
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:53,980
Don't do it.

1723
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:55,700
Don't do it, guys.

1724
01:07:56,080 --> 01:07:57,100
We're just joking.

1725
01:07:57,540 --> 01:07:58,880
We're gonna use our brains.

1726
01:07:59,020 --> 01:07:59,660
Oh, it's time now.

1727
01:07:59,660 --> 01:08:01,600
We're not gonna use other people's brains.

1728
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:03,720
We're gonna use our brains together.

1729
01:08:04,320 --> 01:08:05,160
Yeah, yeah.

1730
01:08:06,060 --> 01:08:07,100
Yeah, and chat's brains.

1731
01:08:07,360 --> 01:08:09,820
But like, with no outside help other than that.

1732
01:08:15,550 --> 01:08:18,070
So I don't know what... Oh, wait, there's 20 Easter eggs now?

1733
01:08:18,230 --> 01:08:18,750
Wait, what?

1734
01:08:19,510 --> 01:08:20,750
Oh, let me find you.

1735
01:08:21,290 --> 01:08:22,870
I was not paying attention.

1736
01:08:23,030 --> 01:08:25,310
What are the other Easter eggs look like?

1737
01:08:26,230 --> 01:08:27,310
They're TVs again.

1738
01:08:27,670 --> 01:08:28,730
Wait, oh, there are more TVs?

1739
01:08:29,650 --> 01:08:31,310
Yeah, I found nine of them already, Doki.

1740
01:08:31,510 --> 01:08:31,950
Oh.

1741
01:08:31,950 --> 01:08:32,190
Oh.

1742
01:08:32,650 --> 01:08:33,970
Here, there's one right here.

1743
01:08:35,190 --> 01:08:36,770
Oh, they added more TVs.

1744
01:08:40,470 --> 01:08:42,770
Oh, I wonder what we get for 20 eggs.

1745
01:08:47,610 --> 01:08:48,410
I got 18.

1746
01:08:49,090 --> 01:08:50,190
I'm at 18 as well.

1747
01:08:50,490 --> 01:08:51,330
I'm at 17.

1748
01:08:51,390 --> 01:08:52,850
What one am I missing that you're at?

1749
01:08:53,010 --> 01:08:53,230
I'm at 19.

1750
01:08:53,650 --> 01:08:54,650
Did you get the one behind the stairs?

1751
01:08:55,290 --> 01:08:56,410
Yeah, I got the one behind the stairs.

1752
01:08:56,410 --> 01:08:58,490
I live in Buckingham Palace.

1753
01:08:59,030 --> 01:08:59,850
Where's the others?

1754
01:09:00,410 --> 01:09:01,450
Wait, there's one upstairs?

1755
01:09:01,830 --> 01:09:02,070
Wait, wait, wait.

1756
01:09:02,130 --> 01:09:02,550
Do it again.

1757
01:09:02,690 --> 01:09:02,990
Really?

1758
01:09:03,210 --> 01:09:04,210
Oh, there's one upstairs.

1759
01:09:04,390 --> 01:09:05,090
I relationship where?

1760
01:09:05,170 --> 01:09:05,710
There's TVs upstairs.

1761
01:09:05,850 --> 01:09:06,770
Nah, this is going to be trouble.

1762
01:09:06,950 --> 01:09:07,730
I did not say this.

1763
01:09:07,730 --> 01:09:08,370
I did not say this.

1764
01:09:08,390 --> 01:09:08,750
Who said this?

1765
01:09:08,890 --> 01:09:10,470
There's a TV in one of the bedrooms.

1766
01:09:11,890 --> 01:09:13,210
All right, I'm gonna have to .

1767
01:09:13,210 --> 01:09:15,050
I searched all six bedroom.

1768
01:09:15,150 --> 01:09:16,050
I didn't see one.

1769
01:09:16,810 --> 01:09:18,490
It's like next to a bed.

1770
01:09:31,610 --> 01:09:32,330
Just laugh.

1771
01:09:33,470 --> 01:09:33,830
Yes.

1772
01:09:37,730 --> 01:09:38,330
A!

1773
01:09:38,930 --> 01:09:40,070
There could be!

1774
01:09:40,830 --> 01:09:43,430
The liar route is open!

1775
01:09:45,690 --> 01:09:49,750
I mean, hey if there was one, then they found an egg!

1776
01:09:49,870 --> 01:09:51,230
No, no, no, not like that, no!

1777
01:09:52,770 --> 01:09:54,150
There's no reason!

1778
01:09:54,190 --> 01:09:56,350
There's always a reason, chat!

1779
01:09:57,910 --> 01:09:59,670
There's always a reason!

1780
01:10:03,890 --> 01:10:04,370
Jokekeeper!

1781
01:10:08,130 --> 01:10:08,610
Jokekeeper!

1782
01:10:08,910 --> 01:10:10,150
I guess you can find one out here.

1783
01:10:11,590 --> 01:10:16,830
Yeah, I like how you knew I was lying when I talked about the bedroom TV.

1784
01:10:17,610 --> 01:10:18,090
Yeah.

1785
01:10:21,690 --> 01:10:24,530
Well, honestly I didn't even hear you, but I would have known either way.

1786
01:10:24,870 --> 01:10:28,590
I mean, I just found out about the TV, so yeah.

1787
01:10:28,750 --> 01:10:29,170
How many are there?

1788
01:10:29,670 --> 01:10:30,630
Oh no, it's time!

1789
01:10:30,770 --> 01:10:31,430
We gotta work together!

1790
01:10:33,250 --> 01:10:36,950
You was the only one that didn't run to the bedrooms.

1791
01:10:39,870 --> 01:10:41,750
It's jokekeeper time!

1792
01:10:43,410 --> 01:10:47,750
I can't believe it, I said that and everybody ran to the fucking...

1793
01:10:47,750 --> 01:10:50,650
Ran to the fucking bedroom!

1794
01:10:53,310 --> 01:10:55,110
That's actually fucking hilarious.

1795
01:10:56,370 --> 01:10:57,410
That's so funny.

1796
01:10:57,410 --> 01:10:59,310
What was that?

1797
01:10:59,310 --> 01:10:59,350
Are you out of your mind?

1798
01:10:59,350 --> 01:10:59,710
Oh no, they're not out of your mind.

1799
01:10:59,770 --> 01:10:59,950
What?

1800
01:11:06,850 --> 01:11:07,490
What?

1801
01:11:07,490 --> 01:11:08,310
What's this?

1802
01:11:08,410 --> 01:11:09,050
What's this?

1803
01:11:09,070 --> 01:11:09,970
The farm?

1804
01:11:09,970 --> 01:11:10,150
The farm.

1805
01:11:10,490 --> 01:11:12,250
Oh, we've been here!

1806
01:11:12,790 --> 01:11:14,670
Isn't this... to be fair...

1807
01:11:14,670 --> 01:11:15,090
This looks like...

1808
01:11:15,090 --> 01:11:15,790
Laranja!

1809
01:11:16,350 --> 01:11:18,310
This looks like the...

1810
01:11:19,210 --> 01:11:22,990
This literally looks like the fucking first map.

1811
01:11:23,830 --> 01:11:25,110
But where is he going?

1812
01:11:25,610 --> 01:11:27,650
He just ran past a familiar face.

1813
01:11:27,730 --> 01:11:28,430
Where did he go?

1814
01:11:28,610 --> 01:11:28,950
Oh!

1815
01:11:28,950 --> 01:11:29,270
Oh!

1816
01:11:32,610 --> 01:11:34,250
There's pictures there!

1817
01:11:36,110 --> 01:11:38,270
There's a lot of pictures there!

1818
01:11:50,190 --> 01:11:51,030
Silence...

1819
01:11:51,030 --> 01:11:51,590
Silence...

1820
01:11:54,430 --> 01:11:55,570
Oh, take a hit.

1821
01:11:58,590 --> 01:11:59,090
Nice.

1822
01:11:59,270 --> 01:12:00,270
We did it, guys.

1823
01:12:00,670 --> 01:12:01,470
We're free.

1824
01:12:02,130 --> 01:12:03,090
We're free.

1825
01:12:03,670 --> 01:12:05,310
Guys, I'm running out of meds, guys.

1826
01:12:06,110 --> 01:12:09,690
I don't have health insurance, guys.

1827
01:12:09,770 --> 01:12:12,930
I can't keep taking them.

1828
01:12:13,630 --> 01:12:15,470
We're gonna run out of meds soon.

1829
01:12:21,110 --> 01:12:23,270
Guys, I don't want to have an addiction, guys.

1830
01:12:24,590 --> 01:12:25,390
Buy more.

1831
01:12:26,410 --> 01:12:29,670
Guys, what if I get addicted to it just like painkillers?

1832
01:12:29,670 --> 01:12:31,650
Guys, I don't want to be those painkillers, guys.

1833
01:12:38,140 --> 01:12:38,540
Hello.

1834
01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:42,200
Dude, I was talking about how you actually saw me.

1835
01:12:42,760 --> 01:12:44,220
And how rare it is.

1836
01:12:44,380 --> 01:12:45,160
Yeah, I saw you!

1837
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:45,760
You're like a dinosaur.

1838
01:12:46,200 --> 01:12:47,100
You're like a dinosaur.

1839
01:12:47,260 --> 01:12:48,560
You only see things that move.

1840
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:49,460
Yeah, that's true.

1841
01:12:49,640 --> 01:12:50,200
That's true.

1842
01:12:50,220 --> 01:12:51,480
If you don't move, I don't see you.

1843
01:12:51,860 --> 01:12:52,260
Yeah.

1844
01:12:52,380 --> 01:12:52,380
That's true.

1845
01:12:52,380 --> 01:12:52,380
If you don't move, I don't see you.

1846
01:12:52,380 --> 01:12:54,400
I see via heat vision.

1847
01:12:55,480 --> 01:12:57,900
I look via heat vision and like movement.

1848
01:12:58,500 --> 01:13:00,640
So if you don't move...

1849
01:13:00,640 --> 01:13:01,480
Yeah, yeah.

1850
01:13:01,580 --> 01:13:02,200
I'm like...

1851
01:13:03,140 --> 01:13:05,840
I think it's the side effects from the meds I'm taking.

1852
01:13:09,220 --> 01:13:11,900
Every time I take it, the voices disappear.

1853
01:13:13,260 --> 01:13:15,220
Oh, I let my voices go.

1854
01:13:15,580 --> 01:13:16,540
You go wild?

1855
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:18,100
Right now, the voices are going...

1856
01:13:23,020 --> 01:13:24,520
Wait, I don't think that's healthy.

1857
01:13:25,540 --> 01:13:25,980
What?

1858
01:13:26,260 --> 01:13:29,000
I don't think... I don't think that's healthy-kun.

1859
01:13:29,320 --> 01:13:30,920
And then the other one's going...

1860
01:13:35,260 --> 01:13:35,700
Wait,

1861
01:13:39,460 --> 01:13:40,200
then how do you hear... Oh!

1862
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:41,540
Wait, how do you hear regular people?

1863
01:13:41,860 --> 01:13:43,440
If you're listening... hearing the voices.

1864
01:13:44,600 --> 01:13:45,780
It gets transcribed.

1865
01:13:45,880 --> 01:13:46,540
Like, there's a...

1866
01:13:46,540 --> 01:13:48,280
There's like a text-to-speech.

1867
01:13:48,280 --> 01:13:48,840
There's a little lag.

1868
01:13:49,080 --> 01:13:51,820
Yeah, subtitles underneath the music.

1869
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,820
So while you're talking, I hear like...

1870
01:13:56,820 --> 01:14:00,280
Nightcore in my right ear, hamster song in my left ear.

1871
01:14:00,300 --> 01:14:04,820
Oh my god, you hear the... the... the Euro... the Eurovision song, Nightcore?

1872
01:14:05,320 --> 01:14:09,420
Yeah, Eurovision song was... You know that song is actually from Eurovision?

1873
01:14:09,800 --> 01:14:10,620
Yeah, I know.

1874
01:14:10,740 --> 01:14:11,140
I know.

1875
01:14:16,740 --> 01:14:18,540
That didn't even win, right?

1876
01:14:18,620 --> 01:14:19,960
That didn't even win Eurovision.

1877
01:14:20,580 --> 01:14:21,100
Oh!

1878
01:14:22,560 --> 01:14:23,080
Whoops.

1879
01:14:23,180 --> 01:14:24,320
Yeah, you guys don't know?

1880
01:14:24,540 --> 01:14:25,060
Rockefeller...

1881
01:14:25,060 --> 01:14:26,580
Yeah, Rockefeller Feet.

1882
01:14:26,620 --> 01:14:28,560
I honestly thought it was an American song.

1883
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:32,260
I thought Rockefeller... Rockefeller was an American song.

1884
01:14:32,520 --> 01:14:34,980
But it's actually a Eurovision song.

1885
01:14:35,160 --> 01:14:36,740
And I don't think it even won Eurovision.

1886
01:14:37,860 --> 01:14:41,080
And the only reason why it's popular is because of Nightcore.

1887
01:14:43,720 --> 01:14:46,320
It's only popular because of Nightcore.

1888
01:14:48,540 --> 01:14:50,100
I don't know.

1889
01:14:50,100 --> 01:14:54,660
I was thinking about Rockefeller as in the... the Rockefeller... Rockefeller Street.

1890
01:14:54,860 --> 01:14:57,500
You know, the Rockefeller building in New York City.

1891
01:14:57,720 --> 01:14:58,620
Yeah, it was Estonia.

1892
01:14:58,800 --> 01:15:00,600
It was from fucking Estonia.

1893
01:15:01,300 --> 01:15:05,160
That's like the country I least expected Rockefeller to be from.

1894
01:15:05,480 --> 01:15:07,940
Because all I could think about is the Rockefeller building.

1895
01:15:10,260 --> 01:15:12,460
The Rockefeller building in New York City.

1896
01:15:12,900 --> 01:15:13,760
I don't think it's that good.

1897
01:15:14,440 --> 01:15:15,260
It sounds really good.

1898
01:15:15,840 --> 01:15:16,320
Seriously.

1899
01:15:16,940 --> 01:15:17,860
I think it's good.

1900
01:15:17,860 --> 01:15:20,820
She was second to last in Eurovision?

1901
01:15:20,980 --> 01:15:23,760
Oh my god, Rockefeller was second to last?

1902
01:15:25,740 --> 01:15:28,240
To be fair, that song...

1903
01:15:28,240 --> 01:15:32,400
That song is like the most popular song during that year too.

1904
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:35,080
I didn't know that.

1905
01:15:35,880 --> 01:15:37,980
I thought it'd be at least popular than that.

1906
01:15:38,220 --> 01:15:40,700
Like who the fuck won Eurovision during that time?

1907
01:15:42,020 --> 01:15:42,860
To be fair.

1908
01:15:43,040 --> 01:15:46,420
Alright, I think everybody knows Eurovision is sort of like...

1909
01:15:46,420 --> 01:15:47,680
It's not really about the song.

1910
01:15:47,860 --> 01:15:48,240
To be fair.

1911
01:15:50,980 --> 01:15:53,200
Eurovision has never really been about the song.

1912
01:15:54,440 --> 01:15:56,220
The quality of the song.

1913
01:15:58,420 --> 01:15:59,300
It's about...

1914
01:15:59,860 --> 01:16:00,660
It's about...

1915
01:16:00,660 --> 01:16:03,660
It's about knowing which country is your ally.

1916
01:16:04,840 --> 01:16:05,280
Like...

1917
01:16:05,960 --> 01:16:06,860
Flash me, push us off.

1918
01:16:06,960 --> 01:16:07,660
Flash me, push us off.

1919
01:16:07,880 --> 01:16:09,420
Dude, that's really it.

1920
01:16:09,900 --> 01:16:11,780
It's like I'm friends with that country.

1921
01:16:11,840 --> 01:16:14,740
I don't care how shitty your song is, but you're my friend.

1922
01:16:18,780 --> 01:16:19,860
It's just like...

1923
01:16:20,380 --> 01:16:22,440
It's just to show you guys who's friends with who.

1924
01:16:24,540 --> 01:16:26,040
Oh, I'm missing strategy talks?

1925
01:16:26,300 --> 01:16:27,040
Oh shit!

1926
01:16:27,240 --> 01:16:28,440
I was jumping around.

1927
01:16:28,820 --> 01:16:30,080
Wait, where's Goomy's...

1928
01:16:30,080 --> 01:16:30,460
Music.

1929
01:16:30,820 --> 01:16:31,680
Fucking cranes.

1930
01:16:32,260 --> 01:16:33,460
Mew, Mew, Mew for me.

1931
01:16:34,300 --> 01:16:37,680
Okay, Mew for me is not a strategy talk.

1932
01:16:38,040 --> 01:16:39,720
That's all I'm saying guys.

1933
01:16:39,860 --> 01:16:40,740
I don't know...

1934
01:16:43,220 --> 01:16:43,740
Hahaha!

1935
01:16:54,240 --> 01:16:55,640
Oh?

1936
01:16:57,300 --> 01:16:58,900
Uh oh.

1937
01:17:00,340 --> 01:17:02,780
We're out of the basement guys.

1938
01:17:06,700 --> 01:17:08,100
What?

1939
01:17:23,740 --> 01:17:30,280
Even the cows on the farm are all part of a fake set which the conjurer oversees personally.

1940
01:17:31,520 --> 01:17:39,020
You will be given basic instructions to complete tasks like baking cakes and brewing simple potions.

1941
01:17:39,020 --> 01:17:40,620
Guys, this is not a puzzle.

1942
01:17:41,080 --> 01:17:49,640
Once everyone has completed the challenge, the curse will be cast upon the last person to successfully finish the previous challenge.

1943
01:17:51,320 --> 01:17:56,920
In this challenge, your goal is to avoid being infected by the conjurer's...

1944
01:17:57,160 --> 01:17:59,000
The puzzle, bake a cake.

1945
01:17:59,080 --> 01:18:00,680
...for the duration of the two minute timer.

1946
01:18:01,420 --> 01:18:05,080
You can pass the curse to other players by tagging them.

1947
01:18:06,760 --> 01:18:14,660
If you are infected when the timer hits zero, your soul will forever belong to us.

1948
01:18:15,460 --> 01:18:19,480
The last set of players to complete each task...

1949
01:18:19,480 --> 01:18:20,520
...will be eliminated.

1950
01:18:20,520 --> 01:18:21,760
Oh god, that's gonna be me guys.

1951
01:18:21,960 --> 01:18:22,920
That's gonna be me!

1952
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:24,220
Task 1.

1953
01:18:24,660 --> 01:18:27,380
The last player will be eliminated.

1954
01:18:27,420 --> 01:18:28,320
That's gonna be me!

1955
01:18:28,720 --> 01:18:29,240
Task 2.

1956
01:18:30,060 --> 01:18:32,280
The last player will be eliminated.

1957
01:18:32,280 --> 01:18:33,640
Oh god, this is gonna be me.

1958
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:34,680
Task 3.

1959
01:18:35,420 --> 01:18:36,900
The last two players will be eliminated.

1960
01:18:36,900 --> 01:18:38,520
Goodbye guys, we had a good run.

1961
01:18:40,480 --> 01:18:41,460
Task 4.

1962
01:18:42,360 --> 01:18:44,660
The last three players will be eliminated.

1963
01:18:44,660 --> 01:18:44,920
What?

1964
01:18:45,020 --> 01:18:46,040
It's gonna be me!

1965
01:18:46,920 --> 01:18:48,740
And for tasks 5 and 6...

1966
01:18:48,740 --> 01:18:49,820
What the fuck?

1967
01:18:49,980 --> 01:18:50,960
Yeah, the hell?

1968
01:18:51,040 --> 01:18:52,140
Goodbye everybody.

1969
01:18:54,560 --> 01:18:55,760
Goodbye everybody.

1970
01:18:56,680 --> 01:18:58,820
That's a lot of people.

1971
01:19:01,280 --> 01:19:05,600
What happened from like 10 to like fucking 200?

1972
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:06,600
Today.

1973
01:19:07,380 --> 01:19:10,960
So, do as the conjurer says.

1974
01:19:11,400 --> 01:19:12,880
And do it fast.

1975
01:19:13,560 --> 01:19:16,900
Or your soul shall join the house of nightmares.

1976
01:19:16,900 --> 01:19:17,880
Yeah, this is...

1977
01:19:17,880 --> 01:19:18,820
We had a good run.

1978
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:20,100
You know what?

1979
01:19:20,520 --> 01:19:22,880
We had such a good run.

1980
01:19:28,300 --> 01:19:29,580
That run.

1981
01:19:32,640 --> 01:19:34,840
I mean, we made it this far.

1982
01:19:34,900 --> 01:19:37,140
Nobody expected me to be...

1983
01:19:37,140 --> 01:19:38,500
To last round 3.

1984
01:19:38,980 --> 01:19:41,160
Guys, nobody expected it.

1985
01:19:42,860 --> 01:19:45,300
Wait, where's my team to strategize?

1986
01:19:45,400 --> 01:19:45,580
Oh!

1987
01:19:46,080 --> 01:19:46,700
No, no, no.

1988
01:19:46,700 --> 01:19:47,140
Sound baited.

1989
01:19:47,140 --> 01:19:47,520
We did it.

1990
01:19:47,580 --> 01:19:47,920
We did it.

1991
01:19:48,100 --> 01:19:49,420
I was watching other people run.

1992
01:19:49,480 --> 01:19:50,540
They knew where other players were.

1993
01:19:50,940 --> 01:19:52,700
It did look like there's...

1994
01:19:52,700 --> 01:19:54,000
Well, did it?

1995
01:19:54,060 --> 01:19:55,380
It kinda looks like there's teams, right?

1996
01:19:55,460 --> 01:19:56,540
I'm integrating into...

1997
01:19:56,540 --> 01:19:57,160
I don't know.

1998
01:19:57,580 --> 01:19:58,160
I don't know.

1999
01:19:58,600 --> 01:19:59,080
Wait, I actually...

2000
01:19:59,080 --> 01:19:59,180
Yeah.

2001
01:19:59,240 --> 01:20:00,720
Are they gonna divide us randomly?

2002
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:01,380
I don't think so.

2003
01:20:01,380 --> 01:20:02,240
Or do it like they did yesterday?

2004
01:20:02,360 --> 01:20:03,720
I think everyone has the same map.

2005
01:20:03,800 --> 01:20:04,900
I think everyone has the same map.

2006
01:20:05,100 --> 01:20:05,360
Yeah.

2007
01:20:05,580 --> 01:20:06,760
It's 15 eliminations from...

2008
01:20:06,760 --> 01:20:08,280
I don't think they know I just got here.

2009
01:20:08,440 --> 01:20:09,420
And then 5 eliminations from the curse.

2010
01:20:09,520 --> 01:20:10,620
So we just need to all be together.

2011
01:20:10,860 --> 01:20:11,120
And like...

2012
01:20:11,120 --> 01:20:11,620
Wait, okay.

2013
01:20:11,780 --> 01:20:12,960
Honestly, once we finish the task...

2014
01:20:12,960 --> 01:20:15,720
I would get away from it and go hide somewhere and see if anyone's there.

2015
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:16,160
Yes.

2016
01:20:16,300 --> 01:20:18,900
Once you do it, it kinda goes task by task, right?

2017
01:20:18,960 --> 01:20:20,380
You do the task and then someone gets eliminated.

2018
01:20:20,600 --> 01:20:21,680
You do it, then we run.

2019
01:20:22,520 --> 01:20:23,420
I believe so.

2020
01:20:24,220 --> 01:20:26,760
If it is separate groups, I don't think it would be.

2021
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:27,580
I think it will be.

2022
01:20:27,580 --> 01:20:28,340
No, that's too many people.

2023
01:20:28,560 --> 01:20:31,060
It was like 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4.

2024
01:20:31,580 --> 01:20:32,980
Only eliminate 20 people?

2025
01:20:33,060 --> 01:20:34,460
That's way too many to be split up.

2026
01:20:34,540 --> 01:20:37,240
Cause it's like 15 per group at that point.

2027
01:20:37,360 --> 01:20:38,400
Well, one in...

2028
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:41,980
I think it's gonna be one in five for each group gets eliminated.

2029
01:20:42,040 --> 01:20:45,660
So if they do 4, then it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like five teams, a ton of people will get eliminated.

2030
01:20:46,020 --> 01:20:47,240
Guys, how do I make a cake in Minecraft?

2031
01:20:47,880 --> 01:20:48,240
Guys, how do I make a cake in Minecraft?

2032
01:20:48,240 --> 01:20:49,240
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

2033
01:20:49,760 --> 01:20:49,880
Wait, they said.

2034
01:20:50,420 --> 01:20:52,640
And then like task 6, it was like...

2035
01:20:52,640 --> 01:20:53,940
We're gonna be, we're gonna be doing potions.

2036
01:20:54,220 --> 01:20:55,080
No, that's what I mean.

2037
01:20:55,140 --> 01:20:57,920
That's why I think they're going to do batches of teams, right?

2038
01:20:58,080 --> 01:20:58,440
Oh, sorry.

2039
01:20:58,440 --> 01:20:59,500
How do I do it?

2040
01:20:59,800 --> 01:21:07,040
For potions, all you do is you do nether wart, and then you do whatever you need to I think the recipe will be there cause there's no way they're gonna.

2041
01:21:07,260 --> 01:21:07,620
Yeah.

2042
01:21:08,340 --> 01:21:10,600
Guys, how do I make potions?

2043
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:12,480
Cause I've never made a potion before.

2044
01:21:12,520 --> 01:21:12,920
How do you...

2045
01:21:14,720 --> 01:21:21,260
So whoever gets the slowest gets eliminated and then the next valid person that would be last to finish is gonna get the curse.

2046
01:21:21,400 --> 01:21:23,000
So you just get out as soon as you're done.

2047
01:21:23,020 --> 01:21:26,800
So you make your teams and then you compete against your team again?

2048
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:28,060
I don't think it's the same.

2049
01:21:28,060 --> 01:21:28,960
I think it's everybody on the same map.

2050
01:21:29,320 --> 01:21:30,180
Is everyone on the same map?

2051
01:21:30,360 --> 01:21:31,340
It's 100% everyone on the same map.

2052
01:21:31,340 --> 01:21:33,320
8 year olds rise up!

2053
01:21:34,260 --> 01:21:38,700
We need you to help me make a cake and improve potions.

2054
01:21:39,460 --> 01:21:40,440
It is a lot.

2055
01:21:40,440 --> 01:21:41,220
That's really overwhelming.

2056
01:21:41,220 --> 01:21:41,900
That's so long.

2057
01:21:42,100 --> 01:21:43,660
Now is the time to take a shot to eliminate this.

2058
01:21:43,700 --> 01:21:44,480
Go grab the curse.

2059
01:21:45,560 --> 01:21:47,240
I thought you were gonna say take a shot.

2060
01:21:47,820 --> 01:21:48,500
That's crazy.

2061
01:21:50,020 --> 01:21:50,380
Alexa!

2062
01:21:50,380 --> 01:21:51,780
How do you make a cake in Minecraft?

2063
01:21:51,960 --> 01:21:54,740
So is it better to be with friends or not with friends?

2064
01:21:55,640 --> 01:21:58,960
If I somehow get the curse, can you let me tag you so I can chase someone?

2065
01:21:59,180 --> 01:22:00,780
In theory, none of us should be cursed.

2066
01:22:01,620 --> 01:22:03,780
Can I tag you so you can tag him?

2067
01:22:03,920 --> 01:22:04,040
No.

2068
01:22:05,180 --> 01:22:07,980
What happened to our package deal?

2069
01:22:09,820 --> 01:22:10,440
What the?

2070
01:22:11,220 --> 01:22:12,420
Did everybody play hot potato?

2071
01:22:13,100 --> 01:22:13,500
Yes.

2072
01:22:14,780 --> 01:22:16,500
There will be one person out of 100.

2073
01:22:16,660 --> 01:22:17,640
So you just gotta be lucky.

2074
01:22:17,860 --> 01:22:20,340
At that point, you just gotta get away from the last people.

2075
01:22:21,500 --> 01:22:23,380
I don't know if there's a delay in passing it.

2076
01:22:23,420 --> 01:22:24,020
I think there's not a delay.

2077
01:22:24,500 --> 01:22:28,860
In theory, a sweat won't have the potato.

2078
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:30,780
And if they do, something terribly wrong happens.

2079
01:22:31,180 --> 01:22:33,080
Yeah, they're gonna wait until the last second and punch someone.

2080
01:22:34,620 --> 01:22:36,400
You should probably walk over to the entrance.

2081
01:22:37,540 --> 01:22:38,860
Is this the entrance over here?

2082
01:22:38,900 --> 01:22:40,000
It's set like 10 minutes.

2083
01:22:40,100 --> 01:22:40,760
Oh, 2 minutes.

2084
01:22:41,220 --> 01:22:42,240
I'm scared, guys.

2085
01:22:43,360 --> 01:22:48,420
We at the bottom, one egg with two sugar on each side for the milk.

2086
01:22:48,780 --> 01:22:49,900
And three buns, guys.

2087
01:22:49,940 --> 01:22:52,980
The moment we get the cake, I need you guys to spam that.

2088
01:22:56,940 --> 01:22:59,620
I need you guys to spam that.

2089
01:23:00,260 --> 01:23:02,380
So when you have the stuff for the cake, you can just...

2090
01:23:02,380 --> 01:23:03,240
There's no emote only.

2091
01:23:03,360 --> 01:23:04,800
There's no emote only for today.

2092
01:23:06,200 --> 01:23:07,000
Good luck, guys.

2093
01:23:07,240 --> 01:23:07,960
Good luck.

2094
01:23:07,960 --> 01:23:11,960
Okay, so you open your inventory and you see where your shield would go, like your all-pand.

2095
01:23:12,100 --> 01:23:14,220
So slightly to the right of that, you click.

2096
01:23:14,320 --> 01:23:15,860
And does it open your crafting menu?

2097
01:23:16,680 --> 01:23:17,000
Yeah?

2098
01:23:17,440 --> 01:23:18,860
We have a crafting menu?

2099
01:23:19,820 --> 01:23:20,580
You'll find it.

2100
01:23:20,680 --> 01:23:24,340
Yeah, click a little bit to the right of where your all-pand is in your inventory.

2101
01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:25,600
How do I...

2102
01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:27,360
How do we open our inventory?

2103
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:31,400
You see at the top left, there's like a red X next to the thing on the right.

2104
01:23:31,520 --> 01:23:31,840
How did he open...

2105
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:32,620
Oh my god!

2106
01:23:32,720 --> 01:23:35,960
You wanna click that, and so it says showing craftable with the checkmark.

2107
01:23:35,960 --> 01:23:39,180
And then once you get the stuff for a cake, it'll tell you how to...

2108
01:23:39,180 --> 01:23:40,100
It'll like literally just...

2109
01:23:40,100 --> 01:23:41,580
You just click on it and it'll make it for you.

2110
01:23:41,660 --> 01:23:42,700
Yeah, then you can just click it.

2111
01:23:42,920 --> 01:23:44,700
We need to walk over there.

2112
01:23:44,820 --> 01:23:46,400
Wait, what did he teach us?

2113
01:23:48,680 --> 01:23:49,560
I forgot!

2114
01:23:50,340 --> 01:23:51,140
I forgot!

2115
01:23:51,220 --> 01:23:53,040
I had to put Minecraft in so long!

2116
01:23:54,180 --> 01:23:55,480
How can you forget?

2117
01:23:55,900 --> 01:23:57,280
It's been so long!

2118
01:23:59,640 --> 01:24:00,880
Where are you?

2119
01:24:00,960 --> 01:24:03,240
I don't know, but people got eliminated.

2120
01:24:03,900 --> 01:24:05,460
A Minecraft player got eliminated.

2121
01:24:05,680 --> 01:24:05,940
Oh, he did.

2122
01:24:05,940 --> 01:24:05,940
I know.

2123
01:24:05,960 --> 01:24:06,560
First date.

2124
01:24:06,920 --> 01:24:08,900
You gotta follow my voice, Fulham.

2125
01:24:09,500 --> 01:24:11,540
No, no, I wanna hear it louder.

2126
01:24:11,700 --> 01:24:12,180
Louder, louder.

2127
01:24:12,480 --> 01:24:14,380
Hello, Fulham.

2128
01:24:14,720 --> 01:24:15,820
Right click on the shield?

2129
01:24:16,060 --> 01:24:17,240
There's nothing on the shield.

2130
01:24:18,080 --> 01:24:19,600
Stop meowing, you perv.

2131
01:24:19,700 --> 01:24:21,560
Stop it.

2132
01:24:23,560 --> 01:24:24,160
Oh...

2133
01:24:32,040 --> 01:24:32,920
Oh god.

2134
01:24:33,160 --> 01:24:33,980
Oh god.

2135
01:24:34,480 --> 01:24:35,520
Where's my tag?

2136
01:24:36,040 --> 01:24:37,200
Where's my tag?

2137
01:24:38,740 --> 01:24:42,080
Find fuel at the fuel power...

2138
01:24:42,080 --> 01:24:42,460
...

2139
01:24:42,700 --> 01:24:43,980
...or the generator?

2140
01:24:48,480 --> 01:24:49,200
...

2141
01:24:49,200 --> 01:24:49,400
...

2142
01:24:50,480 --> 01:24:50,840
...

2143
01:24:50,840 --> 01:24:55,020
I hope these guys are heading to the generator.

2144
01:24:56,040 --> 01:24:56,100
...

2145
01:24:56,700 --> 01:24:57,340
...

2146
01:25:11,290 --> 01:25:12,790
Wait, did I...

2147
01:25:14,190 --> 01:25:15,770
Near the farmer's house.

2148
01:25:15,950 --> 01:25:17,750
Oh, okay, I got confused.

2149
01:25:18,690 --> 01:25:19,890
I got confused.

2150
01:25:19,990 --> 01:25:21,130
Everybody was clicking.

2151
01:25:22,570 --> 01:25:25,070
Oh, E-Rap didn't bring...

2152
01:25:25,070 --> 01:25:25,150
...

2153
01:25:36,440 --> 01:25:37,160
...

2154
01:25:42,890 --> 01:25:44,110
Oh, I run.

2155
01:25:44,330 --> 01:25:45,050
I'm

2156
01:25:49,880 --> 01:25:50,100
confused.

2157
01:25:50,780 --> 01:25:52,640
Everything was so...

2158
01:25:52,640 --> 01:25:53,300
...confusing.

2159
01:25:56,920 --> 01:25:57,280
...

2160
01:25:59,360 --> 01:26:00,420
Oh my god.

2161
01:26:00,920 --> 01:26:02,380
We gotta run.

2162
01:26:02,480 --> 01:26:03,680
We gotta hide.

2163
01:26:04,020 --> 01:26:04,660
Run!

2164
01:26:07,020 --> 01:26:11,000
Oh my god.

2165
01:26:11,020 --> 01:26:12,500
People are trying to camouflage.

2166
01:26:13,620 --> 01:26:15,380
I like how people are...

2167
01:26:15,380 --> 01:26:17,160
We're trying to camouflage right now.

2168
01:26:18,520 --> 01:26:21,040
Oh my god, there's still like three people that haven't...

2169
01:26:23,540 --> 01:26:24,680
What the fuck?

2170
01:26:25,640 --> 01:26:26,520
The fuck is that?

2171
01:26:28,080 --> 01:26:28,400
Okay.

2172
01:26:29,400 --> 01:26:30,040
Alright.

2173
01:26:32,120 --> 01:26:35,940
How is there still like three people that haven't done...

2174
01:26:37,660 --> 01:26:41,720
There's still like three people that haven't done the thing.

2175
01:26:45,380 --> 01:26:46,000
I like this spot.

2176
01:26:46,120 --> 01:26:46,400
Yeah!

2177
01:26:47,640 --> 01:26:49,420
There's no way they can't parkour this.

2178
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:50,860
Oh wait, hold on.

2179
01:26:50,860 --> 01:26:51,360
Up there.

2180
01:26:51,680 --> 01:26:52,300
Hold on.

2181
01:26:52,840 --> 01:26:53,780
Yeah, wait a minute.

2182
01:26:53,940 --> 01:26:54,160
Hold on!

2183
01:26:54,480 --> 01:26:56,960
Yo, yeah, shift back here for the tag section.

2184
01:26:57,180 --> 01:26:57,320
Look out!

2185
01:26:57,500 --> 01:26:57,920
Look out!

2186
01:26:57,920 --> 01:26:57,980
Look out!

2187
01:26:57,980 --> 01:26:59,300
They won't find us really, surely.

2188
01:26:59,780 --> 01:27:00,200
Wait.

2189
01:27:00,400 --> 01:27:01,400
We're fine, we're fine guys.

2190
01:27:01,440 --> 01:27:01,880
We're fine.

2191
01:27:02,700 --> 01:27:03,120
No!

2192
01:27:04,840 --> 01:27:06,220
No, I wanted to...

2193
01:27:06,220 --> 01:27:09,180
It's a bit of alarming that Feinberg and Fairfire left.

2194
01:27:10,620 --> 01:27:11,740
Oh, who is it?

2195
01:27:12,800 --> 01:27:13,960
Someone got eliminated.

2196
01:27:13,960 --> 01:27:14,200
I'm eliminated.

2197
01:27:14,900 --> 01:27:16,460
Hang tight until the next one begins.

2198
01:27:16,840 --> 01:27:17,520
No way.

2199
01:27:18,220 --> 01:27:19,340
This is such a good hiding spot.

2200
01:27:19,500 --> 01:27:19,980
Good job.

2201
01:27:20,100 --> 01:27:21,360
Oh, I see them over there.

2202
01:27:21,380 --> 01:27:21,560
They're...

2203
01:27:21,560 --> 01:27:22,140
Oh, oh, whoa!

2204
01:27:22,500 --> 01:27:22,940
Whoa!

2205
01:27:23,080 --> 01:27:24,020
What the fuck?

2206
01:27:25,180 --> 01:27:25,860
La TNT.

2207
01:27:26,740 --> 01:27:27,380
Oh, I know.

2208
01:27:27,500 --> 01:27:28,220
Oh, what?

2209
01:27:28,640 --> 01:27:29,080
Oh.

2210
01:27:29,940 --> 01:27:30,380
Run!

2211
01:27:30,840 --> 01:27:31,600
Oh, god.

2212
01:27:31,760 --> 01:27:32,720
Where are we running?

2213
01:27:33,600 --> 01:27:34,440
They're over there.

2214
01:27:34,540 --> 01:27:35,240
Isn't that behind us?

2215
01:27:35,260 --> 01:27:35,480
Run!

2216
01:27:35,820 --> 01:27:36,740
Okay, there's the one.

2217
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:37,780
Get it on its front.

2218
01:27:37,920 --> 01:27:38,220
Let's see.

2219
01:27:38,300 --> 01:27:39,740
I don't know where she is.

2220
01:27:39,860 --> 01:27:40,400
I'm scared.

2221
01:27:42,300 --> 01:27:43,360
I'm so scared.

2222
01:27:43,420 --> 01:27:43,940
I don't know.

2223
01:27:43,960 --> 01:27:44,860
I don't know where they are.

2224
01:27:45,180 --> 01:27:45,900
I hope he died.

2225
01:27:46,820 --> 01:27:48,320
Yo, guys, I take you to like dark...

2226
01:27:49,060 --> 01:27:49,960
Are they behind me?

2227
01:27:50,420 --> 01:27:51,300
Are they behind me?

2228
01:27:51,340 --> 01:27:51,820
I can't tell.

2229
01:27:51,860 --> 01:27:52,360
I'm so scared.

2230
01:27:52,420 --> 01:27:53,340
I'm so scared.

2231
01:27:53,420 --> 01:27:53,620
I'm so scared.

2232
01:27:53,620 --> 01:27:53,880
I'm so scared.

2233
01:27:53,880 --> 01:27:54,440
They're behind me.

2234
01:27:54,580 --> 01:27:56,260
I'm just going to keep running because I don't know.

2235
01:27:56,920 --> 01:27:58,440
Like I said, like I said, I have a bad idea.

2236
01:27:58,760 --> 01:27:59,560
There's no stairs?

2237
01:28:00,240 --> 01:28:01,260
No, no way I'm here.

2238
01:28:01,400 --> 01:28:03,140
Wait, can we see the motherfucking through walls?

2239
01:28:03,440 --> 01:28:04,340
Yeah, yeah, we'll see them.

2240
01:28:04,480 --> 01:28:04,780
We'll see them through walls.

2241
01:28:05,240 --> 01:28:05,700
It's not...

2242
01:28:05,700 --> 01:28:05,940
Everybody's silent.

2243
01:28:06,020 --> 01:28:06,540
Everybody's silent.

2244
01:28:06,840 --> 01:28:07,500
Wait, do we see them?

2245
01:28:07,740 --> 01:28:08,320
I'm scared.

2246
01:28:08,500 --> 01:28:09,320
I haven't seen them at all.

2247
01:28:09,360 --> 01:28:09,760
Where are they?

2248
01:28:09,760 --> 01:28:10,080
Where are they?

2249
01:28:13,960 --> 01:28:14,500
I can't tell.

2250
01:28:14,500 --> 01:28:14,760
I can't tell.

2251
01:28:15,020 --> 01:28:15,340
I can't tell.

2252
01:28:15,340 --> 01:28:17,000
Wait, do the motherfuckers with COVID faster than us?

2253
01:28:17,980 --> 01:28:18,700
No, no, no.

2254
01:28:18,720 --> 01:28:18,820
Shh.

2255
01:28:20,200 --> 01:28:20,920
Ryan, you're cracked.

2256
01:28:22,120 --> 01:28:22,720
I'm cracked.

2257
01:28:23,500 --> 01:28:24,680
Well, yeah, you're awesome.

2258
01:28:24,760 --> 01:28:26,080
I am very much cracked.

2259
01:28:26,780 --> 01:28:28,100
Probably shouldn't hide in the house.

2260
01:28:28,220 --> 01:28:28,380
Shh.

2261
01:28:28,540 --> 01:28:29,080
He's coming here.

2262
01:28:30,560 --> 01:28:31,360
Everybody's in the house.

2263
01:28:31,540 --> 01:28:32,280
They're all in the house.

2264
01:28:32,500 --> 01:28:32,980
Come in the house.

2265
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:33,720
Are we online?

2266
01:28:34,260 --> 01:28:34,620
Yo, Corey Wayne.

2267
01:28:35,960 --> 01:28:38,520
Corey Wayne, what are you doing, bro?

2268
01:28:38,940 --> 01:28:40,280
Come, come, come, come, come, come.

2269
01:28:40,940 --> 01:28:41,780
I hope so.

2270
01:28:44,160 --> 01:28:44,720
Are they...

2271
01:28:44,720 --> 01:28:45,500
Aren't they glowing purple?

2272
01:28:45,500 --> 01:28:46,880
Or something like that?

2273
01:28:46,980 --> 01:28:47,920
I think we can see them through the walls.

2274
01:28:48,060 --> 01:28:49,320
Is it like an outline or what kind of glow is it?

2275
01:28:49,320 --> 01:28:49,820
They're really fine.

2276
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:50,540
Yeah, it's an outline.

2277
01:28:50,860 --> 01:28:50,880
Here.

2278
01:28:51,640 --> 01:28:52,480
And why don't we see them?

2279
01:28:53,220 --> 01:28:53,860
False, come up here.

2280
01:28:54,500 --> 01:28:55,400
I hear a heartbeat.

2281
01:28:55,560 --> 01:28:56,440
Or does everybody hear that?

2282
01:28:56,560 --> 01:28:57,160
Yeah, it's getting like...

2283
01:28:57,160 --> 01:28:57,620
I hear a bustle.

2284
01:28:58,140 --> 01:28:58,380
Oh.

2285
01:28:58,780 --> 01:28:59,300
I wonder if it's...

2286
01:28:59,300 --> 01:29:00,000
Ah, there's the ladders.

2287
01:29:05,500 --> 01:29:05,980
I'm scared.

2288
01:29:08,300 --> 01:29:08,540
Guys.

2289
01:29:09,180 --> 01:29:09,800
Guapo, where'd you go?

2290
01:29:09,940 --> 01:29:10,580
Guapo, guapo, guapo, guapo.

2291
01:29:10,580 --> 01:29:10,760
I'm scared.

2292
01:29:10,760 --> 01:29:11,740
Show it to me, show it to me, show it to me.

2293
01:29:11,780 --> 01:29:11,880
Okay.

2294
01:29:12,060 --> 01:29:12,300
How?

2295
01:29:12,480 --> 01:29:13,140
How do you get up there?

2296
01:29:13,280 --> 01:29:14,740
Shift, shift, shift, shift, shift, shift.

2297
01:29:15,640 --> 01:29:16,020
I'm scared.

2298
01:29:17,680 --> 01:29:18,300
I'm so scared.

2299
01:29:18,520 --> 01:29:19,380
Guapo, Guapo, Guapo, Guapo, Guapo.

2300
01:29:19,400 --> 01:29:20,120
Thank God I speak Spanish.

2301
01:29:20,160 --> 01:29:20,540
Come, come, come here.

2302
01:29:20,920 --> 01:29:21,540
They're saying they're coming.

2303
01:29:21,620 --> 01:29:22,200
Just show us, just show us.

2304
01:29:22,200 --> 01:29:22,780
Hide, hide, hide.

2305
01:29:22,840 --> 01:29:23,380
Shift, shift, shift, shift, shift.

2306
01:29:23,380 --> 01:29:23,560
Are you serious?

2307
01:29:23,820 --> 01:29:24,240
Map door.

2308
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:25,080
Woo!

2309
01:29:27,180 --> 01:29:27,480
Let's go.

2310
01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:29,300
That was not the...

2311
01:29:31,580 --> 01:29:31,860
Wolfie.

2312
01:29:31,940 --> 01:29:32,500
Oh my god!

2313
01:29:33,080 --> 01:29:33,900
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

2314
01:29:34,340 --> 01:29:36,200
Collect water from the crate near the water well.

2315
01:29:36,280 --> 01:29:36,580
Collect the water well.

2316
01:29:36,580 --> 01:29:36,840
Okay, water well.

2317
01:29:36,920 --> 01:29:37,480
Where's the water well?

2318
01:29:38,940 --> 01:29:40,060
Yeah, where is the water well?

2319
01:29:40,420 --> 01:29:40,920
Where's the wawa?

2320
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:41,320
I don't know.

2321
01:29:42,780 --> 01:29:43,060
Wawa.

2322
01:29:44,080 --> 01:29:44,660
Where's the water well?

2323
01:29:45,520 --> 01:29:46,100
Oh no.

2324
01:29:46,720 --> 01:29:48,180
Oh wait, that's a well right there.

2325
01:29:48,220 --> 01:29:49,180
Inside the house, inside of the fridge.

2326
01:29:49,540 --> 01:29:50,200
Inside the fridge.

2327
01:29:50,200 --> 01:29:51,140
I don't trust you man.

2328
01:29:51,440 --> 01:29:52,640
In the farm, in the farm, in the farm.

2329
01:29:52,640 --> 01:29:53,000
I'm gonna keep it real with you.

2330
01:29:53,300 --> 01:29:54,340
I'm gonna keep it at buck fifty.

2331
01:29:54,520 --> 01:29:55,180
I do not trust you.

2332
01:29:55,500 --> 01:29:55,920
Where's the sugar cane?

2333
01:29:55,920 --> 01:29:56,620
Wait, it's in the house guys.

2334
01:29:56,720 --> 01:29:57,080
Go get it.

2335
01:29:58,060 --> 01:29:58,600
I'm sick.

2336
01:29:58,720 --> 01:29:59,800
Uh, collect sugar...

2337
01:29:59,800 --> 01:30:00,040
Wait, actually where's the sugar cane?

2338
01:30:00,040 --> 01:30:00,800
Oh, this is the water.

2339
01:30:05,420 --> 01:30:06,240
Where is it?

2340
01:30:06,460 --> 01:30:07,320
I'm so scared.

2341
01:30:07,600 --> 01:30:08,600
I don't know.

2342
01:30:08,940 --> 01:30:10,540
Is that sugar cane over there?

2343
01:30:10,800 --> 01:30:12,980
Oh my god, please tell me that it is.

2344
01:30:13,100 --> 01:30:14,940
What if the sugar is coming from like a...

2345
01:30:14,940 --> 01:30:16,000
Please tell me that it is.

2346
01:30:16,440 --> 01:30:18,020
I'm just following the crowd.

2347
01:30:19,020 --> 01:30:19,340
Where's the water?

2348
01:30:20,380 --> 01:30:21,200
Oh, I got it.

2349
01:30:21,220 --> 01:30:21,700
You can just grab it.

2350
01:30:22,020 --> 01:30:22,340
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2351
01:30:22,340 --> 01:30:23,180
Where's the nether wart farm?

2352
01:30:23,360 --> 01:30:24,240
Where's the nether wart farm?

2353
01:30:24,280 --> 01:30:24,820
Where's the nether wart?

2354
01:30:25,240 --> 01:30:26,100
Where's the nether wart?

2355
01:30:26,280 --> 01:30:26,780
Oh, I see.

2356
01:30:26,800 --> 01:30:27,400
I see the nether wart.

2357
01:30:27,460 --> 01:30:27,960
Yeah, where's the nether wart?

2358
01:30:28,020 --> 01:30:28,380
Where's the nether wart?

2359
01:30:28,500 --> 01:30:29,840
Oh yeah, that's this way.

2360
01:30:29,960 --> 01:30:30,320
Where are we going?

2361
01:30:30,360 --> 01:30:30,940
How do we get it?

2362
01:30:31,140 --> 01:30:31,660
Left hand.

2363
01:30:32,180 --> 01:30:33,000
Oh, it's this way?

2364
01:30:33,040 --> 01:30:33,200
Okay.

2365
01:30:33,380 --> 01:30:34,320
It's by the fuel tower.

2366
01:30:34,660 --> 01:30:35,420
Oh, it's over there.

2367
01:30:35,540 --> 01:30:36,600
How do I grab the sugar?

2368
01:30:37,500 --> 01:30:38,260
Don't go in here.

2369
01:30:43,410 --> 01:30:45,430
Oh, the nether wart followed the crowd.

2370
01:30:46,330 --> 01:30:46,650
Huh?

2371
01:30:47,030 --> 01:30:47,350
Oh, it's over there.

2372
01:30:47,350 --> 01:30:48,670
Guys, where's nether wart?

2373
01:30:48,770 --> 01:30:49,610
Oh, there it is.

2374
01:30:49,610 --> 01:30:49,910
There it is.

2375
01:30:50,050 --> 01:30:50,130
Where's the nether wart?

2376
01:30:50,530 --> 01:30:51,130
In the house.

2377
01:30:51,190 --> 01:30:51,750
Go to the house.

2378
01:30:51,930 --> 01:30:52,970
Where'd you guys get the water?

2379
01:30:53,130 --> 01:30:53,790
Oh, I'm so screwed.

2380
01:30:53,950 --> 01:30:54,750
Where'd you get the water?

2381
01:30:54,870 --> 01:30:55,190
Please?

2382
01:30:56,710 --> 01:30:57,030
Yay!

2383
01:30:57,690 --> 01:30:58,730
Wait, where's the water?

2384
01:30:59,970 --> 01:31:00,830
From the cabinet.

2385
01:31:00,970 --> 01:31:01,650
I'm just gonna follow.

2386
01:31:01,770 --> 01:31:02,310
I'm just gonna follow.

2387
01:31:02,550 --> 01:31:03,390
I'm just gonna follow.

2388
01:31:05,610 --> 01:31:06,470
I'm gonna follow.

2389
01:31:07,290 --> 01:31:07,970
Yeah, I'm gonna follow.

2390
01:31:08,130 --> 01:31:09,250
Are you going to the powder?

2391
01:31:11,230 --> 01:31:12,670
Yes, I am going to the powder.

2392
01:31:12,850 --> 01:31:13,170
Okay.

2393
01:31:13,550 --> 01:31:14,550
Okay, I follow you.

2394
01:31:14,690 --> 01:31:15,370
The door that leads to the middle of it.

2395
01:31:15,510 --> 01:31:16,490
I don't know where the water is.

2396
01:31:16,670 --> 01:31:17,150
Where's the water?

2397
01:31:17,230 --> 01:31:17,330
I don't know.

2398
01:31:17,330 --> 01:31:18,570
Oh, where's Clutch?

2399
01:31:18,670 --> 01:31:19,710
He doesn't have water.

2400
01:31:22,070 --> 01:31:23,050
Yeah, where's the cabinet?

2401
01:31:23,490 --> 01:31:24,010
Over here.

2402
01:31:24,670 --> 01:31:25,030
Oh.

2403
01:31:26,130 --> 01:31:27,130
Gumi, where are you?

2404
01:31:29,970 --> 01:31:31,110
Guys, where's the cabinet?

2405
01:31:31,230 --> 01:31:31,430
Guys.

2406
01:31:31,690 --> 01:31:31,730
I don't know.

2407
01:31:31,810 --> 01:31:32,130
Chicken coop.

2408
01:31:32,130 --> 01:31:32,630
Where's the water?

2409
01:31:32,770 --> 01:31:33,510
To go there.

2410
01:31:33,630 --> 01:31:34,730
We're in awkward potions.

2411
01:31:34,730 --> 01:31:35,130
Go to the barn.

2412
01:31:35,210 --> 01:31:35,590
The barn.

2413
01:31:35,650 --> 01:31:36,130
Chicken coop.

2414
01:31:36,190 --> 01:31:36,550
Chicken coop.

2415
01:31:37,050 --> 01:31:38,050
Oh, I didn't know it said that.

2416
01:31:38,050 --> 01:31:39,670
Wait, was that a chicken coop over there?

2417
01:31:39,910 --> 01:31:40,350
Yeah, the...

2418
01:31:40,730 --> 01:31:42,510
Yeah, I'm pretty sure the barn is chicken.

2419
01:31:45,570 --> 01:31:47,310
Gumi, are you going to brood the chicken coop?

2420
01:31:47,330 --> 01:31:47,770
There's chicken coop.

2421
01:31:51,970 --> 01:31:53,430
Where is the chicken coop?

2422
01:31:54,450 --> 01:31:54,490
It's over there.

2423
01:31:54,550 --> 01:31:55,330
Where's the chicken coop?

2424
01:31:55,350 --> 01:31:56,350
Oh, where's the chickens?

2425
01:31:56,410 --> 01:31:57,310
national numbers In the house?

2426
01:31:57,850 --> 01:31:58,770
Is it in the house?

2427
01:31:58,770 --> 01:32:00,110
No, I think it's in the house, right?

2428
01:32:00,370 --> 01:32:01,550
Is it in the house?

2429
01:32:01,930 --> 01:32:02,090
I feel like it is.

2430
01:32:02,250 --> 01:32:03,090
Where's the chicken coop?

2431
01:32:04,370 --> 01:32:04,810
Blazes� Energy!

2432
01:32:04,810 --> 01:32:05,390
Where's the water?

2433
01:32:05,490 --> 01:32:06,010
Where's the water?

2434
01:32:06,570 --> 01:32:08,530
I don't know where the chicken coop is.

2435
01:32:10,170 --> 01:32:11,050
There's something smaller.

2436
01:32:11,050 --> 01:32:12,210
I don't know how to get the water.

2437
01:32:13,510 --> 01:32:14,830
Where's the chicken coop?

2438
01:32:16,390 --> 01:32:17,070
Never wind up.

2439
01:32:17,070 --> 01:32:21,090
I'm going to throw the water.

2440
01:32:21,090 --> 01:32:21,830
I'm going to throw the water.

2441
01:32:22,190 --> 01:32:23,050
I'm going to throw the water.

2442
01:32:23,510 --> 01:32:24,850
Guys, where is the chicken coop?

2443
01:32:24,950 --> 01:32:26,810
It's the house of the farmer, not the farm.

2444
01:32:27,030 --> 01:32:28,350
It's the house of the farmer, not the farm.

2445
01:32:29,870 --> 01:32:30,790
Is that it?

2446
01:32:30,810 --> 01:32:31,390
Is that it?

2447
01:32:31,470 --> 01:32:32,150
That's the chicken coop?

2448
01:32:32,150 --> 01:32:33,070
That's where everybody is?

2449
01:32:33,230 --> 01:32:34,370
That's where all the chickens are?

2450
01:32:34,990 --> 01:32:35,530
Sugar first!

2451
01:32:36,070 --> 01:32:36,450
Sugar first!

2452
01:32:37,610 --> 01:32:39,430
No, no, no, sugar first.

2453
01:32:40,770 --> 01:32:42,550
How do I prove it?

2454
01:32:42,890 --> 01:32:43,670
Sugar first!

2455
01:32:43,670 --> 01:32:44,790
Sugar first!

2456
01:32:44,790 --> 01:32:46,150
Sugar first!

2457
01:32:46,730 --> 01:32:49,470
Do not put sugar first!

2458
01:32:49,690 --> 01:32:50,990
Guys, wait, what?

2459
01:32:51,210 --> 01:32:52,050
Really?

2460
01:32:52,830 --> 01:32:54,110
Where is the conger?

2461
01:32:54,110 --> 01:32:56,910
What the fuck is a conger?

2462
01:32:57,190 --> 01:32:59,130
Lays top left?

2463
01:33:02,710 --> 01:33:05,890
And then what?

2464
01:33:06,510 --> 01:33:08,790
And then I put sugar?

2465
01:33:09,170 --> 01:33:10,930
What happens after the sweet punch?

2466
01:33:11,530 --> 01:33:13,090
Go to the conger.

2467
01:33:14,110 --> 01:33:14,670
What's that?

2468
01:33:15,130 --> 01:33:17,330
Wait, fire in the middle of the mix?

2469
01:33:17,330 --> 01:33:17,610
Okay.

2470
01:33:19,890 --> 01:33:20,950
And then I put sugar?

2471
01:33:22,630 --> 01:33:23,710
What do I do?

2472
01:33:25,250 --> 01:33:26,430
What do I do?

2473
01:33:26,510 --> 01:33:27,010
Get your mind out of here!

2474
01:33:30,090 --> 01:33:31,150
Get your mind out of here!

2475
01:33:31,150 --> 01:33:31,890
Get your mind out of here!

2476
01:33:32,070 --> 01:33:32,730
Get your mind out of here!

2477
01:33:33,090 --> 01:33:35,270
Get your mind out of here!

2478
01:33:37,050 --> 01:33:39,130
No, no, no, it's just for the sugar.

2479
01:33:39,130 --> 01:33:40,150
It's just for the sugar.

2480
01:33:40,270 --> 01:33:40,510
No!

2481
01:33:43,670 --> 01:33:45,150
Where is the conger?

2482
01:33:45,390 --> 01:33:47,150
Okay, we have to get another bottle of water, Flex.

2483
01:33:47,430 --> 01:33:49,050
No, no, no, I already have the speed.

2484
01:33:49,210 --> 01:33:50,210
Oh, God.

2485
01:33:51,070 --> 01:33:52,570
Where is the conger?

2486
01:33:52,970 --> 01:33:53,790
This big guy right here?

2487
01:33:53,950 --> 01:33:55,110
The one to the left.

2488
01:33:56,190 --> 01:33:57,710
Thank you, thank you.

2489
01:33:58,570 --> 01:33:59,730
Hi, big guy.

2490
01:34:00,910 --> 01:34:01,390
Yes!

2491
01:34:02,710 --> 01:34:03,190
Yeah!

2492
01:34:04,910 --> 01:34:05,390
Yeah!

2493
01:34:05,810 --> 01:34:07,530
I lived!

2494
01:34:07,950 --> 01:34:11,850
Oh my God, it was so stressful!

2495
01:34:11,850 --> 01:34:12,890
From the other ward to the other side.

2496
01:34:12,930 --> 01:34:14,670
Did you guys miss?

2497
01:34:14,690 --> 01:34:15,690
Did you guys miss?

2498
01:34:17,170 --> 01:34:17,710
It's fine.

2499
01:34:18,050 --> 01:34:20,850
When we were getting the other ward, someone was getting water.

2500
01:34:20,970 --> 01:34:21,730
So we're fine.

2501
01:34:22,310 --> 01:34:23,110
Wait, where's milk?

2502
01:34:23,370 --> 01:34:23,770
Where is milk?

2503
01:34:27,490 --> 01:34:29,910
Oh, that was so stressful.

2504
01:34:30,290 --> 01:34:32,190
There's gonna be cake next to...

2505
01:34:32,190 --> 01:34:33,230
I see a cow right there.

2506
01:34:33,310 --> 01:34:34,470
Yeah, there's a cow right there.

2507
01:34:36,070 --> 01:34:37,970
Guys, I feel like I'm gonna...

2508
01:34:37,970 --> 01:34:41,450
I feel like I'm gonna die from the curse.

2509
01:34:42,330 --> 01:34:43,750
I think I'm gonna die from the curse.

2510
01:34:43,750 --> 01:34:43,990
I think I'm gonna die from the curse.

2511
01:34:45,450 --> 01:34:45,890
Yeah.

2512
01:34:47,250 --> 01:34:48,010
I'm scared.

2513
01:34:48,390 --> 01:34:49,350
I'm so scared.

2514
01:34:49,490 --> 01:34:51,310
Eggs over there, and then sugar over there.

2515
01:34:51,710 --> 01:34:53,430
Eggs over there, sugar there.

2516
01:34:53,650 --> 01:34:55,030
Wheat there, milk there.

2517
01:34:55,150 --> 01:34:55,790
Where's the cow?

2518
01:34:56,630 --> 01:34:57,410
It's in the farm.

2519
01:34:59,070 --> 01:35:02,950
Maybe we should stand right next to him while everyone's getting their stuff, no?

2520
01:35:03,150 --> 01:35:03,290
Maybe we should stand right next to him while everyone's getting their stuff, no?

2521
01:35:03,290 --> 01:35:03,870
Well, I feel like we should...

2522
01:35:04,330 --> 01:35:06,570
Well, I feel like we should...

2523
01:35:06,570 --> 01:35:08,550
Well, nonetheless, standing here is good.

2524
01:35:08,770 --> 01:35:09,450
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2525
01:35:09,490 --> 01:35:10,850
This is where everything is.

2526
01:35:11,510 --> 01:35:14,590
Every mob that's around is there for a reason, so I kinda wanna just take one of them.

2527
01:35:14,690 --> 01:35:15,630
Like, what is that right there?

2528
01:35:15,830 --> 01:35:16,470
Your objective.

2529
01:35:16,530 --> 01:35:18,930
Is that a cow?

2530
01:35:19,330 --> 01:35:20,710
Yeah, there's a cow over there.

2531
01:35:20,930 --> 01:35:21,610
Is that a sheep?

2532
01:35:21,910 --> 01:35:22,570
No, that's a sheep.

2533
01:35:24,050 --> 01:35:24,610
Where's the wheat?

2534
01:35:24,690 --> 01:35:25,950
How do we get into the wheat?

2535
01:35:26,750 --> 01:35:27,610
There's a door over there.

2536
01:35:30,310 --> 01:35:31,050
Maybe it's my turn.

2537
01:35:34,190 --> 01:35:34,510
Yeah?

2538
01:35:35,910 --> 01:35:36,990
Yeah, let's look at it together.

2539
01:35:37,290 --> 01:35:38,330
Yeah, let's look at the entrances.

2540
01:35:41,810 --> 01:35:44,430
This one over here looks like it's gonna be...

2541
01:35:44,430 --> 01:35:45,430
An archery test.

2542
01:35:45,690 --> 01:35:45,890
FPS.

2543
01:35:47,050 --> 01:35:48,830
I think it's gonna be good if we like...

2544
01:35:48,830 --> 01:35:49,590
Oh, this is bad.

2545
01:35:49,650 --> 01:35:51,190
I don't know how to do archery in Minecraft.

2546
01:35:52,550 --> 01:35:54,630
Just imagine triple take.

2547
01:35:54,730 --> 01:35:55,950
There's a bullet drop off.

2548
01:35:56,010 --> 01:35:56,330
Okay.

2549
01:35:56,890 --> 01:35:57,770
Follow, follow, follow.

2550
01:35:58,330 --> 01:35:59,590
Bro, are you just fucking with me?

2551
01:36:00,690 --> 01:36:03,590
I'm high rolling standing by the chest over there.

2552
01:36:03,970 --> 01:36:04,990
This is the cow.

2553
01:36:05,370 --> 01:36:06,310
We gotta get the wheat.

2554
01:36:06,450 --> 01:36:07,390
Wait, that's not a real cow.

2555
01:36:07,470 --> 01:36:07,970
It's a human.

2556
01:36:08,230 --> 01:36:09,290
I feel like you just followed me.

2557
01:36:09,290 --> 01:36:10,810
Yeah, I just wanna know where it is though.

2558
01:36:10,930 --> 01:36:12,310
No, look at his face!

2559
01:36:12,630 --> 01:36:13,590
That's not a real cow.

2560
01:36:13,730 --> 01:36:14,490
That can't be a cow.

2561
01:36:14,730 --> 01:36:16,610
I don't know.

2562
01:36:17,190 --> 01:36:19,610
Yeah, but he could be like a costume.

2563
01:36:21,790 --> 01:36:22,190
Wait.

2564
01:36:23,410 --> 01:36:24,690
Wait, these are all freaks.

2565
01:36:24,890 --> 01:36:25,650
There's no way.

2566
01:36:25,750 --> 01:36:26,470
There's like a head.

2567
01:36:27,090 --> 01:36:28,350
There's no way that's a cow.

2568
01:36:29,410 --> 01:36:32,330
It looks like a human cow.

2569
01:36:33,010 --> 01:36:34,690
It looks like some homunculus shit.

2570
01:36:36,830 --> 01:36:38,710
Wait, is a sheep also like that?

2571
01:36:41,150 --> 01:36:41,810
I don't know.

2572
01:36:41,810 --> 01:36:42,490
Hey, don't judge.

2573
01:36:43,870 --> 01:36:45,070
What the fuck?

2574
01:36:45,190 --> 01:36:46,490
They all have those eyes.

2575
01:36:47,010 --> 01:36:48,410
Those creepy eyes.

2576
01:36:50,630 --> 01:36:52,790
The mad cow bear.

2577
01:36:53,190 --> 01:36:54,670
They all have those eyes.

2578
01:36:54,810 --> 01:36:56,750
What the fuck is wrong with her?

2579
01:36:59,150 --> 01:37:00,450
What is wrong?

2580
01:37:00,450 --> 01:37:01,810
They all look like they have PTSD.

2581
01:37:03,070 --> 01:37:04,070
No, it's not her.

2582
01:37:04,270 --> 01:37:08,490
They all look like they have PTSD or some shit.

2583
01:37:08,570 --> 01:37:09,270
They all look like they have PTSD or some shit.

2584
01:37:09,290 --> 01:37:10,690
Oh, that's insane.

2585
01:37:11,010 --> 01:37:11,070
What?

2586
01:37:12,750 --> 01:37:14,670
You got a parkour legend here.

2587
01:37:14,870 --> 01:37:16,250
How do we even get up there?

2588
01:37:19,170 --> 01:37:20,210
Oh my god.

2589
01:37:20,850 --> 01:37:23,570
They just look like they are traumatized about something.

2590
01:37:24,410 --> 01:37:25,930
They look like they've seen things.

2591
01:37:26,030 --> 01:37:27,410
They look like they've seen things.

2592
01:37:27,410 --> 01:37:27,970
Yeah, just like...

2593
01:37:29,730 --> 01:37:31,410
Don't put sugar first!

2594
01:37:34,470 --> 01:37:35,570
Oh my god.

2595
01:37:35,610 --> 01:37:38,950
I feel like some people got fucked over because they put sugar first.

2596
01:37:43,930 --> 01:37:45,210
Holy shit.

2597
01:37:45,430 --> 01:37:46,470
God, I'm nervous.

2598
01:37:46,830 --> 01:37:47,810
Being alive?

2599
01:37:48,130 --> 01:37:48,890
I don't know.

2600
01:37:48,970 --> 01:37:50,610
I don't know if it's good to be like...

2601
01:37:50,610 --> 01:37:53,310
to live past this right now.

2602
01:37:53,370 --> 01:37:54,070
For the objective.

2603
01:37:54,430 --> 01:37:56,670
Because I'm getting more stressed the more...

2604
01:37:56,670 --> 01:37:59,350
the more tasks we get.

2605
01:37:59,650 --> 01:38:01,590
I'm getting more stressed out.

2606
01:38:05,910 --> 01:38:06,470
I'm getting more stressed out.

2607
01:38:06,470 --> 01:38:07,610
If I was eliminated...

2608
01:38:07,610 --> 01:38:07,950
If I was eliminated...

2609
01:38:07,950 --> 01:38:09,730
I could be chilling right now.

2610
01:38:10,150 --> 01:38:10,230
I could be chilling right now.

2611
01:38:12,110 --> 01:38:13,130
Holy shit.

2612
01:38:13,190 --> 01:38:15,390
I'm actually so scared.

2613
01:38:18,410 --> 01:38:19,150
That's okay.

2614
01:38:19,330 --> 01:38:21,550
We're gonna be transported when the curse starts.

2615
01:38:21,930 --> 01:38:24,010
When the curse starts, we're gonna be transported.

2616
01:38:24,030 --> 01:38:24,670
So it doesn't matter.

2617
01:38:25,890 --> 01:38:27,650
Get out of the fields.

2618
01:38:28,250 --> 01:38:28,850
I'm out.

2619
01:38:30,110 --> 01:38:31,530
Oh, there's like cows here too.

2620
01:38:32,710 --> 01:38:34,210
We're gonna have to find the bucket.

2621
01:38:34,410 --> 01:38:34,970
We're gonna have to find the bucket.

2622
01:38:35,350 --> 01:38:36,270
Nice kill.

2623
01:38:37,350 --> 01:38:41,370
You know damn well that 70k is going to a fucking minecrafter.

2624
01:38:41,710 --> 01:38:42,310
Guys.

2625
01:38:42,650 --> 01:38:44,290
You know that, chat.

2626
01:38:44,390 --> 01:38:48,690
There's no way a regular person is gonna get that 70k.

2627
01:38:50,130 --> 01:38:53,090
Minecrafters have been playing Minecraft games for years.

2628
01:38:53,650 --> 01:38:54,950
It's been 20...

2629
01:38:54,950 --> 01:38:57,870
It's been almost 20 years since Minecraft came out.

2630
01:38:58,050 --> 01:39:03,050
Some of these Minecraft streamers have been streaming Minecraft since it came out.

2631
01:39:03,190 --> 01:39:03,670
Guys.

2632
01:39:05,190 --> 01:39:06,010
Loser talk.

2633
01:39:06,350 --> 01:39:08,390
Yeah, Surefour, why aren't you in here?

2634
01:39:09,430 --> 01:39:10,850
That was 70k.

2635
01:39:10,870 --> 01:39:13,370
That could have been an easy 70k for you, Surefour.

2636
01:39:13,530 --> 01:39:14,730
Why aren't you here?

2637
01:39:19,410 --> 01:39:20,530
150 people?

2638
01:39:21,330 --> 01:39:21,610
Guys.

2639
01:39:21,930 --> 01:39:22,330
Oof.

2640
01:39:22,470 --> 01:39:23,390
That's an oofer.

2641
01:39:23,690 --> 01:39:24,910
Right there, Surefour.

2642
01:39:25,050 --> 01:39:26,110
I can't believe it.

2643
01:39:26,250 --> 01:39:27,190
They asked SK.

2644
01:39:27,490 --> 01:39:28,870
And they didn't ask you?

2645
01:39:28,870 --> 01:39:29,890
Hahaha.

2646
01:39:30,630 --> 01:39:30,990
Hahaha.

2647
01:39:33,890 --> 01:39:35,270
Sleepy and Warren were...

2648
01:39:35,270 --> 01:39:37,550
Sleepy, Warren, and Mendo were here, man.

2649
01:39:38,350 --> 01:39:39,850
Is it like... No, it's individual.

2650
01:39:40,870 --> 01:39:42,530
It's like an individual shit.

2651
01:39:43,470 --> 01:39:44,050
It's okay.

2652
01:39:44,130 --> 01:39:45,170
Sleepy, Warren...

2653
01:39:45,170 --> 01:39:46,770
All the Overwatch players got eliminated.

2654
01:39:47,030 --> 01:39:47,970
By the way, though.

2655
01:39:48,190 --> 01:39:48,930
Oh yeah.

2656
01:39:50,850 --> 01:39:54,050
Every Overwatch player that got in got eliminated, man.

2657
01:39:54,990 --> 01:39:56,950
You could have been the one that lived.

2658
01:39:57,210 --> 01:39:57,590
...

2659
01:39:58,870 --> 01:40:01,670
You could have been the last remaining Overwatch player.

2660
01:40:02,130 --> 01:40:02,490
...

2661
01:40:02,490 --> 01:40:03,590
What's in this room?

2662
01:40:04,590 --> 01:40:05,310
Oh no.

2663
01:40:05,510 --> 01:40:06,370
How awful.

2664
01:40:07,610 --> 01:40:08,590
That could have been you.

2665
01:40:11,050 --> 01:40:11,510
Oh yeah.

2666
01:40:11,530 --> 01:40:12,050
We should...

2667
01:40:12,050 --> 01:40:13,090
We should be in the middle.

2668
01:40:13,150 --> 01:40:13,370
Oh yeah.

2669
01:40:13,430 --> 01:40:14,030
We gotta be in the middle.

2670
01:40:14,370 --> 01:40:14,810
Time out.

2671
01:40:14,930 --> 01:40:15,150
Time out.

2672
01:40:15,190 --> 01:40:15,450
Time out.

2673
01:40:15,730 --> 01:40:17,490
I forgot about that.

2674
01:40:17,490 --> 01:40:19,350
That's why you guys wanted me to be out of the fields.

2675
01:40:19,470 --> 01:40:19,670
...

2676
01:40:20,650 --> 01:40:21,390
Oh my god.

2677
01:40:21,470 --> 01:40:22,350
E-Rub was 96?

2678
01:40:23,090 --> 01:40:23,450
...

2679
01:40:24,210 --> 01:40:24,570
Yeah.

2680
01:40:24,670 --> 01:40:25,090
I forgot.

2681
01:40:25,930 --> 01:40:27,110
I need to be all the way over there.

2682
01:40:27,490 --> 01:40:28,410
... Oh, this is scary.

2683
01:40:28,490 --> 01:40:28,690
Please.

2684
01:40:28,870 --> 01:40:29,370
Please, 97.

2685
01:40:29,670 --> 01:40:30,230
Give me a...

2686
01:40:31,010 --> 01:40:32,470
Give me a sec to join the...

2687
01:40:32,470 --> 01:40:33,390
the crowd.

2688
01:40:35,810 --> 01:40:36,550
Let me...

2689
01:40:36,550 --> 01:40:37,410
Guys, I'm lost!

2690
01:40:37,550 --> 01:40:37,670
No!

2691
01:40:41,090 --> 01:40:41,670
Oh no!

2692
01:40:41,750 --> 01:40:42,270
I'm fucked!

2693
01:40:42,390 --> 01:40:42,850
Oh no!

2694
01:40:43,030 --> 01:40:43,430
Oh!

2695
01:40:44,770 --> 01:40:45,170
Guys!

2696
01:40:46,370 --> 01:40:47,390
I fucked myself over.

2697
01:40:48,030 --> 01:40:48,430
No.

2698
01:40:48,730 --> 01:40:49,130
No!

2699
01:40:49,510 --> 01:40:49,910
No!

2700
01:40:49,990 --> 01:40:50,910
I fucked myself over!

2701
01:40:50,990 --> 01:40:51,730
I'm not with the crowd!

2702
01:40:53,590 --> 01:40:55,530
Guys, I don't know how to get out of here!

2703
01:40:55,530 --> 01:40:56,050
...

2704
01:40:59,230 --> 01:40:59,790
Oh no.

2705
01:41:01,190 --> 01:41:02,170
Oh no, guys.

2706
01:41:02,310 --> 01:41:02,950
Oh, there's the crowd!

2707
01:41:03,050 --> 01:41:03,250
There's the crowd!

2708
01:41:03,650 --> 01:41:03,850
...

2709
01:41:07,170 --> 01:41:08,090
Oh, he's behind us!

2710
01:41:08,650 --> 01:41:09,130
Oh god.

2711
01:41:09,430 --> 01:41:10,630
I see him.

2712
01:41:10,630 --> 01:41:10,950
I see him.

2713
01:41:11,610 --> 01:41:12,230
I'm going this way.

2714
01:41:12,270 --> 01:41:12,650
I'm going this way.

2715
01:41:12,690 --> 01:41:13,050
I see them.

2716
01:41:13,550 --> 01:41:14,130
I see them.

2717
01:41:14,190 --> 01:41:14,610
I see them.

2718
01:41:14,690 --> 01:41:15,210
I'm going this way.

2719
01:41:16,110 --> 01:41:16,390
...

2720
01:41:16,970 --> 01:41:17,570
It's so over.

2721
01:41:17,690 --> 01:41:19,070
I didn't know where I was.

2722
01:41:19,850 --> 01:41:20,130
...

2723
01:41:20,130 --> 01:41:20,670
...

2724
01:41:20,670 --> 01:41:21,010
...

2725
01:41:23,030 --> 01:41:23,650
...

2726
01:41:26,470 --> 01:41:27,090
...

2727
01:41:31,490 --> 01:41:32,110
...

2728
01:41:32,110 --> 01:41:33,070
...

2729
01:41:34,790 --> 01:41:35,410
...

2730
01:41:35,410 --> 01:41:36,210
...

2731
01:41:39,330 --> 01:41:39,950
...

2732
01:41:39,950 --> 01:41:44,170
This is an insane spot, bro.

2733
01:41:45,410 --> 01:41:47,330
It's gonna be so busted next time.

2734
01:41:47,410 --> 01:41:47,590
...

2735
01:41:47,590 --> 01:41:47,810
...

2736
01:41:51,150 --> 01:41:51,750
Oh, it's coming!

2737
01:41:52,490 --> 01:41:53,190
I'm joking, joking.

2738
01:41:53,290 --> 01:41:54,230
Why do you guys think this is funny?

2739
01:41:55,630 --> 01:41:55,970
Shh,

2740
01:41:59,010 --> 01:41:59,250
shh.

2741
01:41:59,990 --> 01:42:00,230
Shh.

2742
01:42:01,810 --> 01:42:02,150
Shh.

2743
01:42:02,350 --> 01:42:02,610
Shh.

2744
01:42:04,930 --> 01:42:08,790
Guys, I heard shift and I was like, oh, shift?

2745
01:42:09,090 --> 01:42:09,990
And they were like, don't shift?

2746
01:42:10,090 --> 01:42:10,750
And I was like, shift!

2747
01:42:12,410 --> 01:42:13,350
Don't move, don't move.

2748
01:42:13,530 --> 01:42:14,190
No, no, no.

2749
01:42:16,010 --> 01:42:16,450
Don't move.

2750
01:42:16,450 --> 01:42:17,510
Go, go, go.

2751
01:42:19,130 --> 01:42:19,950
No, no, no.

2752
01:42:21,850 --> 01:42:22,770
No, no, no.

2753
01:42:23,730 --> 01:42:26,930
Don't worry, the Spanish Minecrafters know what they're doing.

2754
01:42:28,270 --> 01:42:30,890
The Spanish Minecrafters know what they're doing.

2755
01:42:31,790 --> 01:42:31,970
No, no, no.

2756
01:42:32,210 --> 01:42:32,770
No.

2757
01:42:34,850 --> 01:42:36,490
Of course they do.

2758
01:42:37,030 --> 01:42:39,030
Minecraft is very popular over there.

2759
01:42:39,470 --> 01:42:40,590
Look at Quackity.

2760
01:42:43,350 --> 01:42:46,090
Freddy, come with us, Freddy.

2761
01:42:46,450 --> 01:42:47,930
The fucking head!

2762
01:42:48,410 --> 01:42:49,910
The fucking head!

2763
01:42:50,070 --> 01:42:50,830
Come with us, Freddy.

2764
01:42:52,090 --> 01:42:53,070
Freddy Pusper.

2765
01:42:54,210 --> 01:42:55,310
Oh, he's behind you!

2766
01:42:56,530 --> 01:42:57,790
Oh, he's right behind me, is he?

2767
01:42:58,530 --> 01:42:59,050
Nice.

2768
01:43:00,170 --> 01:43:01,170
We did it!

2769
01:43:03,270 --> 01:43:04,670
Oh, we did it.

2770
01:43:05,270 --> 01:43:06,630
Oh, we did it.

2771
01:43:06,870 --> 01:43:07,310
Oh, we did it.

2772
01:43:09,310 --> 01:43:09,910
Oh, God.

2773
01:43:10,790 --> 01:43:14,490
Find a note at the farmer's house.

2774
01:43:14,930 --> 01:43:15,770
Oh, my God.

2775
01:43:16,450 --> 01:43:17,350
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2776
01:43:17,670 --> 01:43:19,570
Goomy, where's the farm?

2777
01:43:19,630 --> 01:43:19,830
Goomy!

2778
01:43:21,830 --> 01:43:22,310
Goomy!

2779
01:43:25,710 --> 01:43:27,110
Goomy, I'm right behind you!

2780
01:43:27,810 --> 01:43:28,610
Goomy, I'm right behind you!

2781
01:43:28,610 --> 01:43:30,350
Oh, Goomy's not slowing down, guys.

2782
01:43:30,550 --> 01:43:30,930
Goomy!

2783
01:43:31,630 --> 01:43:32,810
No, it's probably...

2784
01:43:34,730 --> 01:43:37,230
Because Goomy's not slowing down for me.

2785
01:43:38,430 --> 01:43:38,790
Because Goomy's not slowing down for me.

2786
01:43:38,790 --> 01:43:39,530
I'm an alien.

2787
01:43:39,830 --> 01:43:40,890
Wrong house!

2788
01:43:41,230 --> 01:43:41,850
Wrong house!

2789
01:43:42,030 --> 01:43:43,550
Dude, I got so bad spawn.

2790
01:43:43,550 --> 01:43:45,050
That was such a bot spawn.

2791
01:43:45,710 --> 01:43:46,250
Wait.

2792
01:43:46,990 --> 01:43:48,090
Go to the fuel tower.

2793
01:43:48,790 --> 01:43:50,570
Wait, is it the right house?

2794
01:43:51,270 --> 01:43:52,910
Fuel tower, they said fuel tower.

2795
01:43:52,910 --> 01:43:53,890
Is that not the right house?

2796
01:43:54,790 --> 01:43:56,750
Yeah, they're trolling.

2797
01:43:57,370 --> 01:43:58,650
Wait, who's in the right house?

2798
01:43:59,650 --> 01:44:00,190
Oh!

2799
01:44:00,790 --> 01:44:01,870
Oh, doggy run!

2800
01:44:02,270 --> 01:44:03,890
I'm running, I didn't know!

2801
01:44:03,990 --> 01:44:05,090
I trusted you!

2802
01:44:05,510 --> 01:44:07,630
I trusted you!

2803
01:44:09,170 --> 01:44:10,210
Is he in the house?

2804
01:44:10,730 --> 01:44:12,110
Oh my god, we were just at the bottom.

2805
01:44:12,230 --> 01:44:12,710
That's so cool.

2806
01:44:12,910 --> 01:44:13,590
Wait, where is it?

2807
01:44:19,910 --> 01:44:20,550
I don't know.

2808
01:44:20,670 --> 01:44:20,990
Desk?

2809
01:44:21,050 --> 01:44:21,370
Desk?

2810
01:44:22,390 --> 01:44:22,970
Over here?

2811
01:44:24,230 --> 01:44:24,990
Wait, where's the desk?

2812
01:44:26,630 --> 01:44:27,290
Goomy, goomy, goomy, goomy!

2813
01:44:27,530 --> 01:44:28,310
Wait, where is it?

2814
01:44:28,330 --> 01:44:29,050
Oh, I got it!

2815
01:44:29,090 --> 01:44:29,290
I got it!

2816
01:44:30,910 --> 01:44:31,790
Oh my god!

2817
01:44:35,950 --> 01:44:37,310
We got trolled so...

2818
01:44:37,310 --> 01:44:38,690
We got trolled so hard, Goomy!

2819
01:44:41,550 --> 01:44:42,830
Oh, this is bad.

2820
01:44:43,510 --> 01:44:45,470
We got trolled!

2821
01:44:45,730 --> 01:44:48,210
We got trolled!

2822
01:44:48,210 --> 01:44:48,930
Alright, back to it.

2823
01:44:50,530 --> 01:44:52,070
I've seen the chest, I've seen the chest!

2824
01:44:53,950 --> 01:44:55,150
I'm just gonna follow Goomy.

2825
01:44:55,430 --> 01:44:55,490
I'm just gonna follow Goomy.

2826
01:45:00,330 --> 01:45:01,570
Oh no, we have to...

2827
01:45:01,570 --> 01:45:02,270
We saw it too!

2828
01:45:04,610 --> 01:45:05,550
Oh my god!

2829
01:45:05,690 --> 01:45:07,050
This is so nerve-wracking!

2830
01:45:07,210 --> 01:45:08,370
Literally one guy!

2831
01:45:09,010 --> 01:45:10,590
I got so confused!

2832
01:45:11,310 --> 01:45:12,150
That's so fucked up.

2833
01:45:13,310 --> 01:45:14,470
That's so fucked up.

2834
01:45:15,830 --> 01:45:16,910
Alright, going upstairs.

2835
01:45:17,530 --> 01:45:18,190
Where's the chest?

2836
01:45:18,250 --> 01:45:18,570
Where's the chest?

2837
01:45:20,730 --> 01:45:21,250
It's upstairs.

2838
01:45:22,250 --> 01:45:23,490
Yeah, there's a pile of books upstairs.

2839
01:45:23,690 --> 01:45:25,610
It's so hard to speak Spanish so they don't understand.

2840
01:45:27,870 --> 01:45:28,710
Where's the chest?

2841
01:45:28,950 --> 01:45:29,390
Where's the chest?

2842
01:45:29,730 --> 01:45:30,990
Oh wait, no, it's this chest.

2843
01:45:31,050 --> 01:45:31,530
It's this, it's this.

2844
01:45:31,530 --> 01:45:31,750
It's behind me.

2845
01:45:33,330 --> 01:45:34,590
I followed Goomy!

2846
01:45:34,710 --> 01:45:35,730
I followed Goomy!

2847
01:45:35,790 --> 01:45:36,550
I got confused!

2848
01:45:38,910 --> 01:45:40,130
Never follow Goomy!

2849
01:45:40,130 --> 01:45:41,670
I'm so confused!

2850
01:45:47,620 --> 01:45:48,920
Use a note to find a chest.

2851
01:45:50,160 --> 01:45:50,960
Try 1993.

2852
01:45:51,460 --> 01:45:53,420
Oh, is it the number on your file?

2853
01:45:53,760 --> 01:45:54,940
1... 1...

2854
01:45:55,820 --> 01:45:57,020
1... 9... 3...

2855
01:45:58,780 --> 01:45:59,180
Wait...

2856
01:45:59,180 --> 01:46:00,120
I'm not in?

2857
01:46:01,060 --> 01:46:02,140
Where do I take it?

2858
01:46:02,740 --> 01:46:04,080
Find the note right here.

2859
01:46:04,520 --> 01:46:05,300
Right there.

2860
01:46:05,580 --> 01:46:05,980
1993.

2861
01:46:06,380 --> 01:46:07,460
The code is 1993.

2862
01:46:09,300 --> 01:46:11,360
The books are at the top of the barn, okay?

2863
01:46:11,800 --> 01:46:13,140
Oh god, oh god, oh god.

2864
01:46:13,140 --> 01:46:14,300
The chest is behind the barn.

2865
01:46:14,500 --> 01:46:15,500
Oh god.

2866
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:17,700
Oh, I got panicked, guys!

2867
01:46:17,860 --> 01:46:18,800
I panicked!

2868
01:46:19,120 --> 01:46:21,140
I panicked, everybody!

2869
01:46:23,140 --> 01:46:24,000
I panicked, everybody!

2870
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:26,080
I couldn't read because I was panicking!

2871
01:46:27,560 --> 01:46:28,520
Did you get the note?

2872
01:46:28,520 --> 01:46:29,280
Did you get the note?

2873
01:46:29,340 --> 01:46:30,240
Did you get the note?

2874
01:46:30,420 --> 01:46:33,360
Run, run, run!

2875
01:46:34,600 --> 01:46:36,240
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

2876
01:46:36,280 --> 01:46:37,720
Find a note near the pile of books.

2877
01:46:39,040 --> 01:46:39,840
Where's the note?

2878
01:46:40,940 --> 01:46:41,580
Where's the note?

2879
01:46:43,760 --> 01:46:45,580
Is that it?

2880
01:46:46,680 --> 01:46:47,020
We're good?

2881
01:46:47,180 --> 01:46:49,440
I don't know where to go.

2882
01:46:49,980 --> 01:46:50,900
Up here?

2883
01:46:51,260 --> 01:46:52,180
There's gonna be...

2884
01:46:52,180 --> 01:46:54,640
Books right here?

2885
01:46:55,480 --> 01:46:56,700
Do we have to fight right now?

2886
01:46:57,280 --> 01:46:57,960
Nice.

2887
01:46:58,680 --> 01:46:59,620
Where's the book?

2888
01:47:04,780 --> 01:47:06,200
I'm so stressed out!

2889
01:47:06,960 --> 01:47:08,760
I'm so stressed out!

2890
01:47:09,380 --> 01:47:10,940
Holy fuck!

2891
01:47:11,660 --> 01:47:13,020
I'm so...

2892
01:47:13,140 --> 01:47:14,120
I'm so stressful!

2893
01:47:14,640 --> 01:47:15,920
Oh my god!

2894
01:47:16,580 --> 01:47:17,580
Use your note!

2895
01:47:17,660 --> 01:47:18,760
I'm clicking it with the note!

2896
01:47:19,020 --> 01:47:20,740
Oh my god!

2897
01:47:20,740 --> 01:47:21,180
I'm gonna practice!

2898
01:47:21,380 --> 01:47:22,500
I'm gonna practice!

2899
01:47:22,500 --> 01:47:23,000
Haha!

2900
01:47:24,800 --> 01:47:27,040
Yo, you guys wanna do entry practice right now?

2901
01:47:27,100 --> 01:47:27,720
Oh my god!

2902
01:47:28,260 --> 01:47:30,860
I'm gonna practice, guys!

2903
01:47:34,420 --> 01:47:35,980
Oh god, there's falloff.

2904
01:47:36,800 --> 01:47:38,560
Which one's my arrow?

2905
01:47:38,940 --> 01:47:40,000
For the silverfish, right?

2906
01:47:40,140 --> 01:47:41,100
Silverfish is one of the bombs.

2907
01:47:41,440 --> 01:47:41,960
Okay.

2908
01:47:42,240 --> 01:47:42,760
Okay.

2909
01:47:43,140 --> 01:47:44,080
We got aim high.

2910
01:47:44,280 --> 01:47:47,160
I don't even know which one's mine.

2911
01:47:47,420 --> 01:47:48,200
Yeah, I'm just gonna go to the middle.

2912
01:47:48,580 --> 01:47:49,560
There's no point in winning.

2913
01:47:49,580 --> 01:47:50,680
Oh, it's for practice.

2914
01:47:50,920 --> 01:47:51,640
I see.

2915
01:47:53,400 --> 01:47:55,040
I wish I was better with the bow.

2916
01:47:55,340 --> 01:47:55,780
Yes!

2917
01:47:56,600 --> 01:47:58,180
What are we gonna use the sword for?

2918
01:47:58,260 --> 01:48:00,680
Goomy went the wrong way several times.

2919
01:48:00,820 --> 01:48:02,080
I couldn't trust her anymore.

2920
01:48:02,280 --> 01:48:04,060
I couldn't trust her.

2921
01:48:04,180 --> 01:48:07,180
She went the wrong way several times.

2922
01:48:07,780 --> 01:48:08,960
Sonic got eliminated!

2923
01:48:09,520 --> 01:48:10,000
Haha!

2924
01:48:10,200 --> 01:48:11,400
Sonic Fox got eliminated.

2925
01:48:11,900 --> 01:48:12,740
You're good with swords.

2926
01:48:13,140 --> 01:48:13,820
One in each side.

2927
01:48:15,360 --> 01:48:16,240
Uh oh.

2928
01:48:16,560 --> 01:48:17,000
Fuck!

2929
01:48:17,960 --> 01:48:18,400
Fuck!

2930
01:48:18,480 --> 01:48:18,680
Deal!

2931
01:48:23,840 --> 01:48:24,660
I'm going this way.

2932
01:48:24,800 --> 01:48:25,560
I'm going to the house.

2933
01:48:26,080 --> 01:48:26,820
I don't know.

2934
01:48:26,940 --> 01:48:27,360
I'm scared.

2935
01:48:28,200 --> 01:48:29,400
I'm going to the house.

2936
01:48:29,720 --> 01:48:30,680
They are coming this way.

2937
01:48:32,380 --> 01:48:34,260
Which way are they coming over?

2938
01:48:34,300 --> 01:48:35,160
I'm so scared.

2939
01:48:39,280 --> 01:48:40,000
Oh no.

2940
01:48:40,100 --> 01:48:40,580
Oh no.

2941
01:48:40,660 --> 01:48:41,140
Oh no.

2942
01:48:41,180 --> 01:48:42,440
Guys, goodbye everybody.

2943
01:48:44,660 --> 01:48:45,540
Goodbye everyone.

2944
01:48:45,540 --> 01:48:47,440
This might be where we die.

2945
01:48:48,380 --> 01:48:50,880
This might be where we die.

2946
01:48:51,780 --> 01:48:52,380
No!

2947
01:48:54,240 --> 01:48:54,840
Okay.

2948
01:48:55,340 --> 01:48:56,300
Oh no.

2949
01:48:56,940 --> 01:48:58,240
Oh fucking no.

2950
01:48:59,680 --> 01:49:00,780
Oh no guys.

2951
01:49:00,860 --> 01:49:01,360
This is it.

2952
01:49:03,320 --> 01:49:04,760
We actually got hit.

2953
01:49:08,410 --> 01:49:09,390
Oh no.

2954
01:49:10,490 --> 01:49:11,090
Yes.

2955
01:49:11,650 --> 01:49:13,030
This is it guys.

2956
01:49:13,470 --> 01:49:16,350
It was so nice playing with you guys.

2957
01:49:16,570 --> 01:49:17,170
I'm so sorry.

2958
01:49:17,190 --> 01:49:17,470
Okay guys.

2959
01:49:17,570 --> 01:49:20,130
We are going to get eliminated by the curse!

2960
01:49:23,130 --> 01:49:23,810
To the gate.

2961
01:49:23,850 --> 01:49:24,310
To the gate.

2962
01:49:24,350 --> 01:49:25,050
To the gate.

2963
01:49:25,130 --> 01:49:25,650
To the gate.

2964
01:49:25,730 --> 01:49:26,330
To the GATE.

2965
01:49:27,010 --> 01:49:27,890
Where am I going to make it?

2966
01:49:30,450 --> 01:49:31,590
Where are we going to make it to the gate?

2967
01:49:34,670 --> 01:49:35,410
Where'm I going to make it?

2968
01:49:38,210 --> 01:49:39,190
Where'm I gonna make it?

2969
01:49:41,190 --> 01:49:42,350
Which way am I going to make it?

2970
01:49:46,830 --> 01:49:47,170
We might make it?

2971
01:49:47,170 --> 01:49:49,110
I was there at the gate!

2972
01:49:49,950 --> 01:49:50,910
I was there at the gate!

2973
01:49:50,910 --> 01:49:51,890
I was the gate person!

2974
01:49:54,590 --> 01:49:56,250
Stay here, stay here, stay here.

2975
01:49:56,410 --> 01:49:57,510
Get away, get away, get away.

2976
01:49:58,210 --> 01:49:59,130
Look at my mind.

2977
01:50:04,640 --> 01:50:05,600
Oh, oh.

2978
01:50:10,840 --> 01:50:11,320
Oh.

2979
01:50:13,260 --> 01:50:14,080
Run, run, run.

2980
01:50:24,320 --> 01:50:26,740
Dude, they tried to get me.

2981
01:50:26,860 --> 01:50:28,360
They tried to get me off this top.

2982
01:50:29,500 --> 01:50:30,120
Oh, god.

2983
01:50:30,340 --> 01:50:33,420
I knew it was going to start with the bomb.

2984
01:50:33,560 --> 01:50:34,380
I knew it.

2985
01:50:35,160 --> 01:50:35,800
I'm behind.

2986
01:50:36,500 --> 01:50:37,800
I'm behind the gate.

2987
01:50:38,300 --> 01:50:39,000
I'm behind the gate.

2988
01:50:39,180 --> 01:50:40,780
I'm really bad.

2989
01:50:42,020 --> 01:50:43,040
I'm really bad.

2990
01:50:44,840 --> 01:50:45,680
Ah, people.

2991
01:50:45,840 --> 01:50:49,060
The gate, people.

2992
01:50:49,980 --> 01:50:50,980
Move, you fuckers.

2993
01:50:52,860 --> 01:50:54,640
Bro, you all need to get out of my way.

2994
01:50:54,700 --> 01:50:55,580
I swear to god, I'm going to freak out.

2995
01:50:56,760 --> 01:50:58,180
Is somebody going to match my...

2996
01:50:58,360 --> 01:50:58,820
I'm a freak.

2997
01:51:00,160 --> 01:51:01,600
Try to switch, try to switch.

2998
01:51:01,720 --> 01:51:02,940
Don't spam, try to switch.

2999
01:51:04,280 --> 01:51:04,980
Oh, my god.

3000
01:51:05,040 --> 01:51:06,280
Please, give me one.

3001
01:51:08,120 --> 01:51:08,520
This...

3002
01:51:10,360 --> 01:51:12,000
Give me one at least.

3003
01:51:14,760 --> 01:51:15,740
Oh, my god.

3004
01:51:15,860 --> 01:51:16,560
How many did I get?

3005
01:51:18,040 --> 01:51:18,920
Free fire, right?

3006
01:51:20,900 --> 01:51:24,900
It's a stupidity.

3007
01:51:31,480 --> 01:51:31,960
I'm going to get out of here.

3008
01:51:32,320 --> 01:51:32,720
I'm going to get out of here.

3009
01:51:32,720 --> 01:51:33,200
I'm going to get out of here.

3010
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:36,820
Oh, my god.

3011
01:51:38,160 --> 01:51:39,180
How do you flash like that?

3012
01:51:39,220 --> 01:51:39,520
Bow them.

3013
01:51:40,120 --> 01:51:40,780
Bow them.

3014
01:51:41,140 --> 01:51:41,540
Okay.

3015
01:51:41,660 --> 01:51:43,680
Get out, get criticals, and kill the last one.

3016
01:51:43,780 --> 01:51:44,200
And that's it.

3017
01:51:44,200 --> 01:51:44,580
There's no problem.

3018
01:51:45,140 --> 01:51:45,840
I can't.

3019
01:51:46,100 --> 01:51:47,440
I can't see.

3020
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:50,840
It's actually sun.

3021
01:51:52,840 --> 01:51:53,240
God!

3022
01:52:04,870 --> 01:52:06,890
Red, there's a bunch outside the barn.

3023
01:52:06,970 --> 01:52:07,890
Red, there's a ton outside.

3024
01:52:08,090 --> 01:52:08,950
It's very complicated to hit them.

3025
01:52:08,970 --> 01:52:09,470
Oh, my god.

3026
01:52:09,470 --> 01:52:09,710
Oh, they're outside?

3027
01:52:10,190 --> 01:52:10,950
Yeah, right here.

3028
01:52:14,650 --> 01:52:15,310
Okay, good.

3029
01:52:16,810 --> 01:52:17,470
Oh, my god.

3030
01:52:17,490 --> 01:52:17,990
I need one more.

3031
01:52:18,130 --> 01:52:21,590
I need one more, too.

3032
01:52:21,650 --> 01:52:22,770
I need one more, too.

3033
01:52:22,770 --> 01:52:23,130
Oh, god.

3034
01:52:24,150 --> 01:52:24,570
Okay.

3035
01:52:26,710 --> 01:52:27,550
They despawned.

3036
01:52:28,190 --> 01:52:29,690
This way is faster.

3037
01:52:30,190 --> 01:52:31,610
You can jump up from the stairs.

3038
01:52:33,430 --> 01:52:36,230
You can stand here and jump through here.

3039
01:52:36,630 --> 01:52:36,970
I'm dying to that.

3040
01:52:37,090 --> 01:52:37,590
I'm dying to that.

3041
01:52:37,590 --> 01:52:38,450
Oh, no, no, no.

3042
01:52:38,970 --> 01:52:39,390
Where's the control?

3043
01:52:39,630 --> 01:52:40,330
In the middle?

3044
01:52:40,610 --> 01:52:42,150
How do we get there?

3045
01:52:43,630 --> 01:52:44,710
Break around the...

3046
01:52:52,650 --> 01:52:54,070
How do you guys get there?

3047
01:52:59,090 --> 01:52:59,690
Oh, no.

3048
01:53:00,270 --> 01:53:01,270
That was actually insane.

3049
01:53:01,450 --> 01:53:03,890
It's either the cake or the target practice.

3050
01:53:04,550 --> 01:53:05,110
Oh.

3051
01:53:05,450 --> 01:53:07,470
Oh, god.

3052
01:53:08,230 --> 01:53:09,110
Oh, I can't leave.

3053
01:53:11,730 --> 01:53:12,850
So stressful.

3054
01:53:13,550 --> 01:53:15,330
I hate this game.

3055
01:53:15,330 --> 01:53:20,410
Oh, my god.

3056
01:53:22,790 --> 01:53:24,430
Oh, my god.

3057
01:53:24,430 --> 01:53:27,130
Oh, my god.

3058
01:53:29,650 --> 01:53:30,250
Oh, please.

3059
01:53:30,250 --> 01:53:30,990
Well, if it's troll, it's fine.

3060
01:53:31,110 --> 01:53:32,030
Everyone, man.

3061
01:53:34,390 --> 01:53:35,590
Leave me.

3062
01:53:35,950 --> 01:53:37,110
Guys, please.

3063
01:53:37,310 --> 01:53:38,610
Just eliminate me.

3064
01:53:42,050 --> 01:53:45,150
Guys, I'm going to be the last tank.

3065
01:53:45,330 --> 01:53:46,670
There's no fucking way.

3066
01:53:51,870 --> 01:53:54,110
This is too much.

3067
01:53:54,110 --> 01:53:54,750
My heart.

3068
01:53:54,770 --> 01:53:56,530
My fucking heart, man.

3069
01:53:58,150 --> 01:53:59,950
My fucking heart.

3070
01:54:06,010 --> 01:54:08,650
My fucking heart, man.

3071
01:54:08,690 --> 01:54:09,410
I can't.

3072
01:54:09,410 --> 01:54:11,010
My hands are shaking.

3073
01:54:11,010 --> 01:54:15,150
And I'm so stressed out and I want this to be over.

3074
01:54:26,670 --> 01:54:28,010
I'm just gonna go here.

3075
01:54:28,990 --> 01:54:30,790
My heart can't take it.

3076
01:54:33,550 --> 01:54:34,670
My heart.

3077
01:54:35,190 --> 01:54:36,930
My heart can't take it, guys.

3078
01:54:42,650 --> 01:54:45,770
I'm assuming there's two more challenges and then one more ChrisRans probably.

3079
01:54:46,570 --> 01:54:47,830
How many have we done so far?

3080
01:54:48,730 --> 01:54:49,770
We've done four ChrisRans.

3081
01:54:50,250 --> 01:54:53,030
If someone could hit this double Neo, they're never getting tagged.

3082
01:54:53,690 --> 01:54:54,290
No, I don't think you can.

3083
01:54:56,010 --> 01:54:56,410
Wait.

3084
01:54:56,410 --> 01:54:57,130
I got it.

3085
01:54:57,210 --> 01:54:57,430
I got it.

3086
01:54:57,450 --> 01:54:58,970
Wait, that's just so much better, isn't it?

3087
01:54:59,070 --> 01:55:05,650
Jesus Christ, I got infected as the first person, but he didn't notice I infected him back.

3088
01:55:05,790 --> 01:55:06,190
We're safe.

3089
01:55:07,590 --> 01:55:08,910
Oh my god, dude.

3090
01:55:09,710 --> 01:55:10,490
I'm like hungry.

3091
01:55:10,490 --> 01:55:11,470
Let's try to...

3092
01:55:11,470 --> 01:55:12,750
I can't.

3093
01:55:13,350 --> 01:55:14,150
I can't.

3094
01:55:14,310 --> 01:55:14,710
Pssss.

3095
01:55:14,810 --> 01:55:15,430
They're so smart.

3096
01:55:16,350 --> 01:55:16,750
Hi.

3097
01:55:16,890 --> 01:55:18,650
Dead people, shh, shh, shh.

3098
01:55:19,190 --> 01:55:20,330
That's my shit on the beat, ho.

3099
01:55:21,350 --> 01:55:22,010
We're here!

3100
01:55:22,190 --> 01:55:22,630
We're here!

3101
01:55:23,650 --> 01:55:24,430
Oh no, bro!

3102
01:55:25,510 --> 01:55:25,910
Hi!

3103
01:55:26,730 --> 01:55:27,590
Oh no, bro.

3104
01:55:27,690 --> 01:55:28,150
You don't know, bro.

3105
01:55:28,230 --> 01:55:28,410
Security.

3106
01:55:29,430 --> 01:55:31,970
Wait, is it one more, one more time?

3107
01:55:32,050 --> 01:55:33,310
They're in their toki.

3108
01:55:33,990 --> 01:55:35,490
Wait, they're getting too excited.

3109
01:55:37,390 --> 01:55:39,010
Uh-oh, uh-oh.

3110
01:55:39,010 --> 01:55:39,310
Uh-oh.

3111
01:55:39,310 --> 01:55:39,770
Uh-oh.

3112
01:55:39,770 --> 01:55:40,070
Uh-oh.

3113
01:55:40,690 --> 01:55:41,050
Stinky!

3114
01:55:41,690 --> 01:55:43,490
You're not just gonna hide here, aren't you gonna dip?

3115
01:55:43,970 --> 01:55:45,590
Yeah, I guess I'll just hide here then.

3116
01:55:46,130 --> 01:55:46,490
Weeeeeee!

3117
01:55:46,590 --> 01:55:47,970
I mean, that's not really that key.

3118
01:55:49,210 --> 01:55:53,470
Okay, if they ran in through stairs, we need to just escape again.

3119
01:55:54,730 --> 01:55:57,090
I'm taking the route out the back if they get off the stairs.

3120
01:55:57,910 --> 01:55:58,790
Tracker is just a hundred miles away.

3121
01:55:59,730 --> 01:56:00,090
Stinky!

3122
01:56:00,810 --> 01:56:01,570
And am I spine?

3123
01:56:01,870 --> 01:56:02,790
Yeah, yeah, yeah, surely.

3124
01:56:02,790 --> 01:56:06,550
Guys, if they come in, don't forget!

3125
01:56:09,010 --> 01:56:09,970
Internal panic.

3126
01:56:10,970 --> 01:56:11,830
Oh god.

3127
01:56:13,630 --> 01:56:15,330
Jump down there to fight them!

3128
01:56:16,610 --> 01:56:17,090
Yay!

3129
01:56:17,090 --> 01:56:19,530
We lived just to get eliminated!

3130
01:56:20,430 --> 01:56:22,730
We lived to get eliminated!

3131
01:56:26,050 --> 01:56:27,170
It's water time.

3132
01:56:27,530 --> 01:56:29,270
Oh my god, of course it's bucket, bro.

3133
01:56:29,550 --> 01:56:30,910
It's water time!

3134
01:56:31,330 --> 01:56:32,430
It's well and well.

3135
01:56:33,970 --> 01:56:35,690
Do you think the water well has the bucket?

3136
01:56:36,310 --> 01:56:36,670
Oh.

3137
01:56:36,810 --> 01:56:37,670
It says it on the top left.

3138
01:56:38,990 --> 01:56:39,350
Hello.

3139
01:56:41,530 --> 01:56:41,690
Hello.

3140
01:56:41,890 --> 01:56:44,470
Okay, we didn't go the wrong way, so that's good.

3141
01:56:45,350 --> 01:56:46,610
Cow pen, where's the cow pen?

3142
01:56:48,950 --> 01:56:50,870
Cow pen, it's at the cow pen, at the cow pen.

3143
01:56:51,870 --> 01:56:52,450
Where's the cow pen?

3144
01:56:52,450 --> 01:56:53,570
Where the fuck is the cow pen?

3145
01:56:53,670 --> 01:56:54,550
Where's the cow pen?

3146
01:56:54,830 --> 01:56:55,490
It's over here, it's over here.

3147
01:56:56,210 --> 01:56:56,930
Cow pen.

3148
01:56:57,310 --> 01:56:57,850
Where is it?

3149
01:56:57,890 --> 01:56:58,210
Where is it?

3150
01:56:58,590 --> 01:56:59,430
No, no, it's not here.

3151
01:56:59,730 --> 01:56:59,950
Cow pen.

3152
01:57:00,230 --> 01:57:00,810
Cow pen.

3153
01:57:01,070 --> 01:57:01,830
Does anyone remember?

3154
01:57:02,810 --> 01:57:03,530
Brown cow?

3155
01:57:04,850 --> 01:57:05,450
Brown cow?

3156
01:57:05,450 --> 01:57:07,730
Brown cow?

3157
01:57:10,090 --> 01:57:12,970
Follow the Spanish Minecrafters.

3158
01:57:14,150 --> 01:57:17,830
Follow the Spanish Minecrafters.

3159
01:57:17,830 --> 01:57:19,470
Yeah, I think we don't know where we are going.

3160
01:57:19,890 --> 01:57:21,610
Over there, over there.

3161
01:57:22,250 --> 01:57:24,610
Oh, we're going to the danger zone.

3162
01:57:24,610 --> 01:57:25,370
Go, go, go.

3163
01:57:25,750 --> 01:57:26,350
Follow...

3164
01:57:28,330 --> 01:57:30,950
Follow the Spanish Minecrafters!

3165
01:57:31,090 --> 01:57:32,150
Go, go.

3166
01:58:01,970 --> 01:58:02,110
Look, there are the chickens.

3167
01:58:02,150 --> 01:58:04,310
Guys, I can't...

3168
01:58:04,970 --> 01:58:06,990
Guys, how do I get to that weed faster?

3169
01:58:08,850 --> 01:58:11,250
Guys, how do I get to that weed faster?

3170
01:58:14,290 --> 01:58:16,530
Guys, I don't know how to get to the weed!

3171
01:58:19,930 --> 01:58:20,890
Guys, GG's guys.

3172
01:58:21,010 --> 01:58:21,510
It was...

3173
01:58:21,950 --> 01:58:23,810
It was a good run.

3174
01:58:25,530 --> 01:58:28,410
It was a good run.

3175
01:58:29,610 --> 01:58:31,210
I don't know how to get to that weed.

3176
01:58:31,290 --> 01:58:31,750
I'm so...

3177
01:58:34,870 --> 01:58:35,630
I'm gonna go here.

3178
01:58:37,350 --> 01:58:38,210
Guys, GG.

3179
01:58:38,330 --> 01:58:39,090
It was a good run.

3180
01:58:39,250 --> 01:58:41,250
I don't know how to get to that weed faster.

3181
01:58:41,450 --> 01:58:42,710
It was a good run!

3182
01:58:45,070 --> 01:58:45,510
Goodbye.

3183
01:58:46,430 --> 01:58:47,350
Goodbye everybody.

3184
01:58:47,710 --> 01:58:50,590
I'm too stressed out to do jumps.

3185
01:58:53,210 --> 01:58:53,850
Oh, guys.

3186
01:58:54,330 --> 01:58:55,250
Collect an egg.

3187
01:58:55,370 --> 01:58:56,710
Oh, I know how to get the egg!

3188
01:58:57,270 --> 01:58:57,890
This way?

3189
01:58:58,710 --> 01:58:59,270
This way?

3190
01:59:00,570 --> 01:59:01,010
Oh.

3191
01:59:01,070 --> 01:59:01,290
Oh.

3192
01:59:04,270 --> 01:59:04,750
No!

3193
01:59:05,150 --> 01:59:05,630
Guys.

3194
01:59:05,630 --> 01:59:09,550
I don't know the route.

3195
01:59:11,890 --> 01:59:12,590
Oh, no!

3196
01:59:12,710 --> 01:59:14,130
I forgot the egg route.

3197
01:59:14,250 --> 01:59:14,610
Guys!

3198
01:59:16,270 --> 01:59:17,510

3199
01:59:17,510 --> 01:59:18,710
Guys, where's the eggs?

01:59:19,450 --> 01:59:21,030
Yeah, it has to be R3 and X, right?

Guys, where's the eggs?

3205
01:59:31,650 --> 01:59:32,130
I don't know.

3206
01:59:32,130 --> 01:59:32,990
Where's the chicken coop?

3207
01:59:33,670 --> 01:59:36,310
Oh, is that the chicken coop?

3208
01:59:38,050 --> 01:59:41,370
Is this the chicken coop?

3209
01:59:41,550 --> 01:59:41,710
No?

3210
01:59:42,070 --> 01:59:42,750
Where's the eggs?

3211
01:59:48,070 --> 01:59:49,470
Farmer house, is it this way?

3212
01:59:49,730 --> 01:59:52,090
Oh guys, I didn't know where the eggs were.

3213
01:59:52,290 --> 01:59:54,730
I didn't know where the eggs were guys.

3214
01:59:56,430 --> 01:59:57,950
Is this where the eggs are?

3215
02:00:04,370 --> 02:00:04,890
Guys...

3216
02:00:08,270 --> 02:00:08,670
Guys...

3217
02:00:09,150 --> 02:00:09,550
Guys...

3218
02:00:09,550 --> 02:00:11,110
I didn't know where the eggs are.

3219
02:00:15,320 --> 02:00:15,720
GG's.

3220
02:00:15,880 --> 02:00:16,680
Guys, do you know where the eggs?

3221
02:00:17,480 --> 02:00:18,280
I'm confused.

3222
02:00:18,560 --> 02:00:19,200
Where are the eggs?

3223
02:00:21,060 --> 02:00:21,820
Nobody's helping!

3224
02:00:23,640 --> 02:00:24,940
Guys, it was a good run.

3225
02:00:25,140 --> 02:00:26,560
I actually don't know where the eggs are.

3226
02:00:27,340 --> 02:00:28,900
Guys, do you guys know where the eggs are?

3227
02:00:30,840 --> 02:00:31,240
Guys?

3228
02:00:31,460 --> 02:00:32,920
Do you guys know where the eggs are?

3229
02:00:33,920 --> 02:00:34,320
Yeah...

3230
02:00:34,840 --> 02:00:35,980
Where's the farmer's house?

3231
02:00:37,180 --> 02:00:38,720
I think I'm out though.

3232
02:00:38,840 --> 02:00:40,460
I'm fucking GG's.

3233
02:00:40,580 --> 02:00:41,920
Do you know where the farmer's eggs are?

3234
02:00:42,060 --> 02:00:43,100
Come here, over here!

3235
02:00:44,800 --> 02:00:46,660
I think it's over.

3236
02:00:46,940 --> 02:00:48,340
I got lost in the eggs.

3237
02:00:49,260 --> 02:00:51,080
I got lost in the eggs.

3238
02:00:52,740 --> 02:00:54,960
I survived the second day.

3239
02:00:55,300 --> 02:00:55,860
I survived the second day.

3240
02:00:55,860 --> 02:00:56,860
My chat fucked me.

3241
02:00:56,960 --> 02:00:58,300
My chat made me lost.

3242
02:00:58,440 --> 02:01:00,480
And me too, I'm lost too.

3243
02:01:00,660 --> 02:01:02,280
We were both lost.

3244
02:01:02,760 --> 02:01:03,800
Right click, right click, hurry!

3245
02:01:05,380 --> 02:01:05,940

Doki!

3250
02:01:20,180 --> 02:01:20,720

3251
02:01:21,520 --> 02:01:23,160
Come on, hurry, hurry, hurry!

3252
02:01:23,340 --> 02:01:25,320
Oh, I'm hurrying, hurrying, hurrying, I'm hurrying!

02:01:25,360 --> 02:01:26,120
I'm so lost!

3254
02:01:28,440 --> 02:01:30,820
Gumi, it was a good run, Gumi.

3255
02:01:31,140 --> 02:01:33,300
No, come on, Doki, run!

3256
02:01:33,380 --> 02:01:35,140
You live on for me, Gumi!

3257
02:01:35,320 --> 02:01:36,960
Gumi, live on for me!

3258
02:01:36,960 --> 02:01:38,520
It's too late!

3259
02:01:39,020 --> 02:01:40,800
It's too late, Gumi!

3260
02:01:40,940 --> 02:01:42,460
We had a good run!

3261
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:44,860
You and we just live!

3262
02:01:46,260 --> 02:01:46,940
Gumi!

3263
02:01:48,600 --> 02:01:50,260
Gumi, it's okay!

3264
02:01:50,740 --> 02:01:52,480
It's over, Gumi!

3265
02:01:52,600 --> 02:01:55,480
You have to accept the fact that it's over!

3266
02:01:56,480 --> 02:01:58,240
It's over, Gumi!

3267
02:02:00,260 --> 02:02:01,520
Gumi, it's over!

3268
02:02:02,520 --> 02:02:03,840
It's over at last!

3269
02:02:04,440 --> 02:02:04,960
At last!

3270
02:02:07,580 --> 02:02:09,540
Alright, I'm here to curse you all now!

3271
02:02:14,940 --> 02:02:16,660
It's time to curse!

3272
02:02:17,360 --> 02:02:18,580
Oh my god!

3273
02:02:19,420 --> 02:02:20,120
It's so cold!

3274
02:02:20,500 --> 02:02:27,460
Oh my god, it's time!

3275
02:02:29,220 --> 02:02:29,820
Yes!

3276
02:02:31,560 --> 02:02:34,260
Alright, it's time to be the curse, guys!

3277
02:02:37,880 --> 02:02:39,480
Oh my god!

3278
02:02:40,980 --> 02:02:42,380
Oh my god!

3279
02:02:42,920 --> 02:02:44,800
Chad, we're both idiots!

3280
02:02:45,320 --> 02:02:47,380
We're both fucking idiots!

3281
02:02:48,300 --> 02:02:49,120
Oh my god!

3282
02:02:53,480 --> 02:02:54,080
Oh...

3283
02:02:54,080 --> 02:02:54,900
Never mind.

3284
02:02:55,480 --> 02:02:58,780
Shane, I was banking on following you this round...

3285
02:02:58,780 --> 02:02:59,220
Oh my god!

3286
02:02:59,220 --> 02:03:00,960
...and you seemed very indecisive...

3287
02:03:01,520 --> 02:03:01,800
We're both idiots!

3288
02:03:01,800 --> 02:03:03,000
...which is kind of concerning me.

3289
02:03:03,640 --> 02:03:05,500
Gumi actually clutched it!

3290
02:03:05,680 --> 02:03:06,940
Well, now you're going to my house.

3291
02:03:06,940 --> 02:03:07,300
You're going to my spot.

3292
02:03:08,340 --> 02:03:09,980
Gumi actually clutched it!

3293
02:03:10,480 --> 02:03:10,800
What?

3294
02:03:12,520 --> 02:03:13,080
No, no, no.

3295
02:03:13,120 --> 02:03:13,340
Trust.

3296
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:14,320
Trust.

3297
02:03:14,360 --> 02:03:14,620
Trust.

3298
02:03:14,620 --> 02:03:14,880
Trust.

3299
02:03:14,880 --> 02:03:15,700
The person knows, though.

3300
02:03:16,160 --> 02:03:16,480
So...

3301
02:03:16,480 --> 02:03:17,040
Trust.

3302
02:03:17,040 --> 02:03:17,180
Trust.

3303
02:03:17,260 --> 02:03:17,380
Bakuno.

3304
02:03:17,420 --> 02:03:17,540
Bakuno.

3305
02:03:17,820 --> 02:03:18,400
They're coming.

3306
02:03:18,500 --> 02:03:18,740
They're coming.

3307
02:03:19,580 --> 02:03:19,900
Kiken.

3308
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:20,720
Kiken, are you there?

3309
02:03:24,020 --> 02:03:26,340
They went the other way at the start, so I don't know if they...

3310
02:03:26,340 --> 02:03:29,080
Yeah, they didn't even know he clutched it through the round with the chest.

3311
02:03:29,680 --> 02:03:30,940
Josh, how do we get out of this place?

3312
02:03:31,200 --> 02:03:31,840
No, no, no.

3313
02:03:31,980 --> 02:03:33,740
No, Cyd, no.

3314
02:03:33,740 --> 02:03:34,140
We have to get out of here.

3315
02:03:36,120 --> 02:03:36,660
Speed's over.

3316
02:03:36,780 --> 02:03:37,600
What are you doing, bro?

3317
02:03:37,700 --> 02:03:38,500
Bro, they can see you.

3318
02:03:38,500 --> 02:03:40,360
Bro, you have to clutch up.

3319
02:03:40,420 --> 02:03:41,220
That's the only way.

3320
02:03:42,420 --> 02:03:43,120
Where's Sylvie?

3321
02:03:43,600 --> 02:03:43,960
Hello?

3322
02:03:44,200 --> 02:03:44,220
Hi, Apple.

3323
02:03:44,880 --> 02:03:46,000
Chiv, chiv, chiv, chiv, chiv.

3324
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:47,380
I think people discovered our spot.

3325
02:03:48,400 --> 02:03:49,200
What are you doing?

3326
02:03:50,220 --> 02:03:51,220
I'm coming, coming.

3327
02:03:51,540 --> 02:03:51,900
Coming.

3328
02:03:52,020 --> 02:03:52,160
Shhh.

3329
02:03:53,200 --> 02:03:53,780
Gumi, Gumi.

3330
02:03:54,660 --> 02:03:55,200
I'm coming.

3331
02:03:55,280 --> 02:03:55,420
I'm coming.

3332
02:03:55,500 --> 02:03:55,760
I'm coming.

3333
02:03:56,040 --> 02:03:56,400
Run.

3334
02:03:57,320 --> 02:03:57,680
Here.

3335
02:03:57,740 --> 02:03:58,040
Run here.

3336
02:03:58,180 --> 02:03:58,980
I don't think they're coming.

3337
02:03:59,120 --> 02:04:00,380
I don't think so.

3338
02:04:00,520 --> 02:04:01,800
Put the chair under the table.

3339
02:04:02,220 --> 02:04:02,580
Sorry.

3340
02:04:03,080 --> 02:04:03,380
It's Gumi.

3341
02:04:03,400 --> 02:04:03,720
It's Gumi.

3342
02:04:05,280 --> 02:04:06,180
Guys, pull out.

3343
02:04:06,180 --> 02:04:06,660
Shif, shif, shif.

3344
02:04:06,660 --> 02:04:07,160
Don't move, don't move, don't move.

3345
02:04:07,320 --> 02:04:07,760
Shif, shif, shif.

3346
02:04:07,780 --> 02:04:08,380
Trying to get momentum.

3347
02:04:09,040 --> 02:04:10,040
Gumi, Gumi, Gumi.

3348
02:04:12,320 --> 02:04:12,740
Guys.

3349
02:04:13,200 --> 02:04:14,760
Gumi actually took me to the finish line.

3350
02:04:14,760 --> 02:04:15,320
He's right behind me, isn't he?

3351
02:04:16,040 --> 02:04:17,440
Shout out to Gumi.

3352
02:04:17,960 --> 02:04:21,800
Gumi, shout out to Gumi for taking me all the way to the end.

3353
02:04:22,480 --> 02:04:23,460
So how are y'all doing?

3354
02:04:25,080 --> 02:04:25,920
What the?

3355
02:04:26,700 --> 02:04:27,120
Hola.

3356
02:04:28,140 --> 02:04:28,560
Hola.

3357
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:29,920
I'm trying to get you bullied.

3358
02:04:30,120 --> 02:04:30,440
Hola.

3359
02:04:30,840 --> 02:04:31,120
Hola.

3360
02:04:31,540 --> 02:04:31,920
Hola.

3361
02:04:32,960 --> 02:04:33,380
Hola.

3362
02:04:33,640 --> 02:04:33,680
I'm trying to get you bullied.

3363
02:04:33,680 --> 02:04:34,440
You guys are both idiots, guys.

3364
02:04:34,560 --> 02:04:36,980
There were so many instructions that I got scared.

3365
02:04:37,920 --> 02:04:39,740
You know I panicked, guys.

3366
02:04:39,980 --> 02:04:41,640
You know I panicked.

3367
02:04:41,760 --> 02:04:43,180
We were both at fault.

3368
02:04:43,260 --> 02:04:43,700
That's all.

3369
02:04:43,740 --> 02:04:44,240
That's all.

3370
02:04:44,580 --> 02:04:48,540
Except the fact that we both didn't get there.

3371
02:04:48,660 --> 02:04:48,960
Wait.

3372
02:04:48,980 --> 02:04:50,720
Toppo got considered out.

3373
02:04:52,900 --> 02:04:53,700
Oh, no.

3374
02:04:54,180 --> 02:04:54,700
Okay.

3375
02:04:54,760 --> 02:04:56,040
Now this is where we leave.

3376
02:04:58,640 --> 02:05:00,380
I got Catdazzar theme.

3377
02:05:02,060 --> 02:05:03,540
How is someone already finished?

3378
02:05:03,640 --> 02:05:05,100
I was seeing where you're blocking my shots, bro.

3379
02:05:05,100 --> 02:05:05,180
How is someone already finished?

3380
02:05:05,180 --> 02:05:06,480
Give me a little space here, man.

3381
02:05:07,200 --> 02:05:07,660
I'm done.

3382
02:05:07,740 --> 02:05:08,060
I'm done.

3383
02:05:08,160 --> 02:05:09,920
I got like 12, man.

3384
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:10,460
I got a 12.

3385
02:05:10,460 --> 02:05:10,940
I got a 12.

3386
02:05:11,080 --> 02:05:11,720
Okay, you know what?

3387
02:05:14,040 --> 02:05:15,500
We should probably back to blocking.

3388
02:05:16,820 --> 02:05:17,220
Blocked in.

3389
02:05:18,620 --> 02:05:19,320
So good.

3390
02:05:21,700 --> 02:05:22,900
You can do it.

3391
02:05:22,980 --> 02:05:23,440
Did you do it?

3392
02:05:24,620 --> 02:05:25,000
What?

3393
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:25,380
That's it?

3394
02:05:25,520 --> 02:05:25,720
Oh.

3395
02:05:26,260 --> 02:05:26,640
Okay.

3396
02:05:26,900 --> 02:05:27,280
Silky!

3397
02:05:28,020 --> 02:05:28,940
Silky, you can do it!

3398
02:05:29,220 --> 02:05:30,500
Remember, bullet drop off.

3399
02:05:30,560 --> 02:05:31,240
Bullet drop off.

3400
02:05:31,400 --> 02:05:32,040
Aim a little higher.

3401
02:05:32,040 --> 02:05:32,920
Okay.

3402
02:05:33,120 --> 02:05:33,900
Nice, Silky!

3403
02:05:35,140 --> 02:05:35,980
Oh, I got it!

3404
02:05:36,020 --> 02:05:36,240
I got it!

3405
02:05:36,260 --> 02:05:38,620
I got it!

3406
02:05:38,620 --> 02:05:39,080
I got it!

3407
02:05:39,080 --> 02:05:39,680
I got it!

3408
02:05:39,740 --> 02:05:39,920
I got it!

3409
02:05:40,500 --> 02:05:40,960
Oh!

3410
02:05:42,900 --> 02:05:43,980
No, no, no!

3411
02:05:44,320 --> 02:05:45,920
One more!

3412
02:05:46,020 --> 02:05:46,500
One more!

3413
02:05:46,500 --> 02:05:47,160
One more!

3414
02:05:47,200 --> 02:05:48,100
One more!

3415
02:05:48,440 --> 02:05:48,820
You got it!

3416
02:05:48,940 --> 02:05:51,940
I have to do another day of this.

3417
02:05:53,340 --> 02:05:53,800
Kumi.

3418
02:05:55,480 --> 02:05:55,940
Kumi.

3419
02:05:56,600 --> 02:05:57,060
Wait.

3420
02:05:58,400 --> 02:06:00,920
We have to do day three, Kumi.

3421
02:06:01,020 --> 02:06:01,480
Wait.

3422
02:06:01,680 --> 02:06:01,900
Wait.

3423
02:06:02,940 --> 02:06:03,660
You mean?

3424
02:06:04,120 --> 02:06:06,940
We have to do day three, Kumi.

3425
02:06:07,140 --> 02:06:08,060
We have to do day three, Kumi.

3426
02:06:08,680 --> 02:06:10,160
You're the very last person!

3427
02:06:11,200 --> 02:06:11,740
You're the very last person!

3428
02:06:11,740 --> 02:06:12,080
I hate that.

3429
02:06:13,460 --> 02:06:14,440
Oh my god.

3430
02:06:14,460 --> 02:06:16,380
I was... Kumi clutched it.

3431
02:06:16,460 --> 02:06:17,240
I was 85.

3432
02:06:17,640 --> 02:06:19,500
And then I tagged somebody instantly.

3433
02:06:20,580 --> 02:06:21,200
I know.

3434
02:06:21,320 --> 02:06:21,740
It's so hard.

3435
02:06:21,740 --> 02:06:22,200
Oh my god.

3436
02:06:22,660 --> 02:06:23,660
Kumi, you did it.

3437
02:06:23,720 --> 02:06:24,420
Me and my chat.

3438
02:06:24,440 --> 02:06:25,860
Now we play Valorant after this.

3439
02:06:26,340 --> 02:06:26,960
Okay, Kumi.

3440
02:06:27,040 --> 02:06:28,280
My heart cannot take it right now.

3441
02:06:28,300 --> 02:06:28,880
I'm fucking out.

3442
02:06:31,040 --> 02:06:32,320
I just want you to know.

3443
02:06:32,460 --> 02:06:33,960
I went through like the five seconds.

3444
02:06:33,980 --> 02:06:34,760
I think Sage is a grief there.

3445
02:06:39,980 --> 02:06:40,900
Oh my god.

3446
02:06:40,940 --> 02:06:41,080
No.

3447
02:06:41,180 --> 02:06:43,180
My anxiety was peaking for you.

3448
02:06:43,340 --> 02:06:44,160
Not just for myself.

3449
02:06:44,180 --> 02:06:48,860
The entire game, I didn't feel super anxious until you had...

3450
02:06:48,860 --> 02:06:49,500
Oh my god.

3451
02:06:49,720 --> 02:06:50,420
I was so lost.

3452
02:06:50,820 --> 02:06:52,320
I was so lost.

3453
02:06:52,380 --> 02:06:53,740
I didn't know where the eggs were.

3454
02:06:53,860 --> 02:06:54,500
I was begging.

3455
02:06:54,840 --> 02:06:56,560
My crafters are so cruel.

3456
02:06:56,660 --> 02:06:57,260
I was begging.

3457
02:06:57,360 --> 02:06:59,420
Nobody would tell me where the eggs are.

3458
02:07:00,080 --> 02:07:01,520
And then sometimes they lie.

3459
02:07:01,520 --> 02:07:02,760
Yeah, they lie.

3460
02:07:02,780 --> 02:07:04,460
And then I'm like, wait, I don't believe you.

3461
02:07:04,580 --> 02:07:06,200
I can't believe it.

3462
02:07:06,940 --> 02:07:08,360
You're not allowed to swear.

3463
02:07:08,600 --> 02:07:10,980
But they gaslight us instead.

3464
02:07:12,300 --> 02:07:13,620
They gaslight us.

3465
02:07:14,260 --> 02:07:15,500
But we made it.

3466
02:07:15,520 --> 02:07:17,020
We made it.

3467
02:07:17,140 --> 02:07:17,800
We did it.

3468
02:07:19,080 --> 02:07:20,840
Is it going to be something scary?

3469
02:07:20,960 --> 02:07:22,260
Is something scary going to happen?

3470
02:07:22,280 --> 02:07:22,420
I don't know.

3471
02:07:23,680 --> 02:07:26,260
Guys, I don't know where the four embers are.

3472
02:07:26,740 --> 02:07:27,860
There's so many houses.

3473
02:07:27,860 --> 02:07:29,900
There's so many houses.

3474
02:07:31,360 --> 02:07:36,240
No, the hard part was you guys were like, stop, back, there, forward.

3475
02:07:36,600 --> 02:07:38,500
That was what fucked me up.

3476
02:07:39,480 --> 02:07:41,180
We survived another day of a nightmare.

3477
02:07:41,900 --> 02:07:43,440
We got to like, back, forward.

3478
02:07:43,440 --> 02:07:44,040
Rest in peace, Tubbo.

3479
02:07:44,260 --> 02:07:47,840
I was like, back, forward, front, left.

3480
02:07:53,680 --> 02:07:55,360
Oh my god.

3481
02:07:55,800 --> 02:07:57,380
Wait, I was on the main street.

3482
02:07:57,380 --> 02:07:57,780
I was on the main street.

3483
02:07:57,860 --> 02:07:59,740
Oh my god.

3484
02:07:59,880 --> 02:08:02,280
Well, I said my truth.

3485
02:08:02,380 --> 02:08:04,540
I said my truth, guys.

3486
02:08:04,920 --> 02:08:07,680
I said my truth, guys.

3487
02:08:09,680 --> 02:08:10,420
My truth.

3488
02:08:10,580 --> 02:08:11,720
I didn't study.

3489
02:08:13,460 --> 02:08:14,140
Please.

3490
02:08:14,240 --> 02:08:16,200
A barn can be a house.

3491
02:08:16,540 --> 02:08:17,420
I don't know.

3492
02:08:17,600 --> 02:08:19,300
I've never been on a farm before.

3493
02:08:19,640 --> 02:08:21,080
I'm a city gal.

3494
02:08:24,280 --> 02:08:26,300
I'm a city gal.

3495
02:08:26,500 --> 02:08:27,840
I don't know what city gal is.

3496
02:08:27,860 --> 02:08:28,260
What's what?

3497
02:08:30,580 --> 02:08:32,000
You don't say.

3498
02:08:32,980 --> 02:08:34,260
Oh my god.

3499
02:08:34,800 --> 02:08:35,640
40 people tomorrow.

3500
02:08:35,940 --> 02:08:37,260
40 people get eliminated tomorrow?

3501
02:08:37,380 --> 02:08:38,660
40 elims tomorrow.

3502
02:08:39,240 --> 02:08:39,920
That's horrible.

3503
02:08:41,300 --> 02:08:42,760
I still need two more.

3504
02:08:43,020 --> 02:08:43,980
A house is a house.

3505
02:08:45,040 --> 02:08:46,260
Tubbo died for this.

3506
02:08:46,360 --> 02:08:52,160
A minecrafter died so I can live on today.

3507
02:08:52,640 --> 02:08:54,060
A minecrafter died so I can live on today.

3508
02:08:54,060 --> 02:08:54,480
A minecrafter died so I can live on today.

3509
02:08:54,480 --> 02:08:54,940
Gumi, please.

3510
02:08:55,240 --> 02:08:56,880
Gumi, I don't know in my heart.

3511
02:08:57,860 --> 02:08:58,960
It's a five stack.

3512
02:08:59,060 --> 02:09:00,200
A five stack?

3513
02:09:00,660 --> 02:09:02,780
Okay, if you get a five stack going.

3514
02:09:03,420 --> 02:09:05,500
I'm gonna go grab food though.

3515
02:09:05,860 --> 02:09:07,460
I haven't finished my food.

3516
02:09:08,860 --> 02:09:10,760
The last B-Tuber lives on.

3517
02:09:11,500 --> 02:09:12,980
I can't believe it.

3518
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:16,960
A minecrafter died so I can be in day three.

3519
02:09:17,160 --> 02:09:18,600
I can't believe it.

3520
02:09:20,820 --> 02:09:23,340
I took an actual minecrafter spot.

3521
02:09:24,380 --> 02:09:24,940
Gumi.

3522
02:09:25,520 --> 02:09:26,080
Hi.

3523
02:09:26,360 --> 02:09:27,640
Where are the newies?

3524
02:09:27,660 --> 02:09:27,840
I'm not sure.

3525
02:09:27,840 --> 02:09:29,200
Uh...

3526
02:09:30,440 --> 02:09:31,640
Equivalent exchange.

3527
02:09:33,620 --> 02:09:35,880
I'm just happy it's over.

3528
02:09:36,240 --> 02:09:36,980
I'm happy.

3529
02:09:37,360 --> 02:09:39,420
I can't believe it.

3530
02:09:39,620 --> 02:09:43,910
I can't believe it.

3531
02:09:47,170 --> 02:09:49,250
I can't believe.

3532
02:09:50,870 --> 02:09:52,550
My man.

3533
02:09:53,210 --> 02:09:55,290
Tomorrow we go again.

3534
02:09:56,550 --> 02:09:58,030
Oh my god.

3535
02:09:58,030 --> 02:10:00,190
I'm doing my days.

3536
02:10:02,030 --> 02:10:04,550
I barely made it like four times.

3537
02:10:04,690 --> 02:10:05,550
I should not be alive.

3538
02:10:06,330 --> 02:10:07,590
I should not be alive.

3539
02:10:07,750 --> 02:10:11,430
I already was going through like the five stages of grief of getting eliminated.

3540
02:10:16,330 --> 02:10:18,250
I have the plot armor.

3541
02:10:19,590 --> 02:10:20,810
I'm the main character.

3542
02:10:25,730 --> 02:10:27,810
The main character plot.

3543
02:10:27,910 --> 02:10:28,590
Guys, guys.

3544
02:10:29,950 --> 02:10:37,930
How about we both agreed that we both fucked up together during that the egg part.

3545
02:10:38,130 --> 02:10:41,650
The egg section, we both messed up.

3546
02:10:41,850 --> 02:10:42,290
Okay?

3547
02:10:42,310 --> 02:10:45,350
As a group, we both take responsibility.

3548
02:10:45,950 --> 02:10:48,950
And then Gumi clutched it for me.

3549
02:10:55,150 --> 02:10:56,970
Gumi clutched it for us.

3550
02:10:57,070 --> 02:10:59,450
But we both messed up together.

3551
02:11:03,130 --> 02:11:04,610
Oh my god.

3552
02:11:05,490 --> 02:11:07,170
Okay, group picture time.

3553
02:11:09,830 --> 02:11:11,550
I'll give you celebrate anything.

3554
02:11:11,910 --> 02:11:12,730
He's gone.

3555
02:11:13,150 --> 02:11:14,170
Wait, who's gone?

3556
02:11:14,610 --> 02:11:14,610
He's gone.

3557
02:11:15,030 --> 02:11:15,930
Everyone's gone.

3558
02:11:16,190 --> 02:11:16,990
Everybody's gone.

3559
02:11:17,490 --> 02:11:18,430
Yeah, I took...

3560
02:11:18,430 --> 02:11:19,070
Lost Cub fan.

3561
02:11:19,370 --> 02:11:20,530
I was the last person.

3562
02:11:20,810 --> 02:11:22,350
I took a Minecrafter's place.

3563
02:11:22,930 --> 02:11:25,370
I don't even play this game.

3564
02:11:25,630 --> 02:11:27,550
I just learned E is inventory today.

3565
02:11:28,570 --> 02:11:29,470
That's crazy.

3566
02:11:30,750 --> 02:11:32,850
And Topa lost to me.

3567
02:11:33,590 --> 02:11:34,530
That's amazing.

3568
02:11:34,910 --> 02:11:35,670
Oh my gosh.

3569
02:11:35,790 --> 02:11:37,270
What horrifying thing to hear.

3570
02:11:39,750 --> 02:11:40,790
Are you monster?

3571
02:11:40,870 --> 02:11:41,270
Let me go.

3572
02:11:42,810 --> 02:11:43,410
Yay.

3573
02:11:46,730 --> 02:11:49,010
Are we looking at the same area?

3574
02:11:49,010 --> 02:11:51,030
I don't know.

3575
02:11:53,830 --> 02:11:56,270
Where am I supposed to look at?

3576
02:11:59,590 --> 02:12:00,230
I...

3577
02:12:01,290 --> 02:12:03,670
I hope I'm looking at the...

3578
02:12:03,670 --> 02:12:04,090
Whoa.

3579
02:12:04,390 --> 02:12:06,710
I hope I'm looking at the right area.

3580
02:12:07,130 --> 02:12:08,250
I don't know.

3581
02:12:09,630 --> 02:12:10,930
Who's the cameraman?

3582
02:12:12,050 --> 02:12:13,410
Who's the cameraman?

3583
02:12:13,630 --> 02:12:14,570
Two minutes?

3584
02:12:14,830 --> 02:12:15,050
Oh.

3585
02:12:17,270 --> 02:12:17,910
Okay.

3586
02:12:18,690 --> 02:12:19,330
No.

3587
02:12:20,190 --> 02:12:22,870
I have to be in front for exposure.

3588
02:12:25,610 --> 02:12:26,710
As the...

3589
02:12:26,710 --> 02:12:34,530
As the one of the last few non-Minecraft players in this lobby, I deserve to be in the front.

3590
02:12:38,550 --> 02:12:39,190
Who...

3591
02:12:39,190 --> 02:12:41,370
That's not fair.

3592
02:12:41,550 --> 02:12:43,450
You guys have to be mature about this.

3593
02:12:43,450 --> 02:12:46,150
I was mature enough to take responsibility.

3594
02:12:46,430 --> 02:12:51,050
But now you guys also have to be mature enough to also take responsibility.

3595
02:12:53,150 --> 02:12:56,550
Guys, we are mature adults here.

3596
02:12:57,370 --> 02:13:00,390
We should both equally take the blame.

3597
02:13:07,170 --> 02:13:11,230
Guys, we both equally share the blame.

3598
02:13:11,230 --> 02:13:12,510
But we can all agree.

3599
02:13:12,850 --> 02:13:15,130
Gumi clutched it for us.

3600
02:13:15,230 --> 02:13:17,010
Gumi saved our asses.

3601
02:13:19,270 --> 02:13:20,690
Who was it?

3602
02:13:21,470 --> 02:13:22,850
I kept on going.

3603
02:13:23,370 --> 02:13:24,010
Left.

3604
02:13:24,030 --> 02:13:24,570
Right.

3605
02:13:24,910 --> 02:13:25,550
Back.

3606
02:13:25,670 --> 02:13:26,190
Forward.

3607
02:13:28,790 --> 02:13:29,430
Yeah.

3608
02:13:31,550 --> 02:13:32,830
We did it.

3609
02:13:34,450 --> 02:13:36,050
It was me.

3610
02:13:36,250 --> 02:13:37,150
Guys, look.

3611
02:13:37,310 --> 02:13:38,490
I was very overwhelmed.

3612
02:13:39,630 --> 02:13:40,910
As the...

3613
02:13:40,910 --> 02:13:42,410
As the non-Minecraft player.

3614
02:13:42,550 --> 02:13:45,390
I am already directionally challenged, guys.

3615
02:13:49,690 --> 02:13:53,130
I was already very directionally challenged.

3616
02:13:54,630 --> 02:13:55,870
Oh, you finally relaxed.

3617
02:13:57,610 --> 02:13:58,810
Why does...

3618
02:13:58,810 --> 02:13:59,730
Guys.

3619
02:14:00,090 --> 02:14:06,930
Why did my urge of wanting to win overpowered my rest week?

3620
02:14:11,470 --> 02:14:14,950
I can't believe we made it to this point.

3621
02:14:15,530 --> 02:14:17,010
It doesn't matter.

3622
02:14:17,190 --> 02:14:18,830
We are going to get eliminated anyway.

3623
02:14:21,130 --> 02:14:23,130
We are just too competitive.

3624
02:14:25,670 --> 02:14:26,510
Oh my god.

3625
02:14:27,790 --> 02:14:30,390
This is the most stressful rest week of all time.

3626
02:14:30,570 --> 02:14:31,270
It really is.

3627
02:14:31,530 --> 02:14:32,850
It really is.

3628
02:14:33,170 --> 02:14:36,730
It's actually the most stressful rest week we've had.

3629
02:14:37,650 --> 02:14:39,090
Each game has...

3630
02:14:39,710 --> 02:14:40,190
It's like...

3631
02:14:40,190 --> 02:14:40,370
I...

3632
02:14:40,370 --> 02:14:42,050
Why am I so stressed out?

3633
02:14:42,570 --> 02:14:44,930
Why am I so stressed out?

3634
02:14:49,330 --> 02:14:50,930
Oh my god.

3635
02:14:52,790 --> 02:14:53,450
Oh my god.

3636
02:14:53,450 --> 02:14:53,830
Oh my god.

3637
02:14:53,910 --> 02:14:54,130
Guys.

3638
02:14:56,130 --> 02:14:57,390
We are going to call it here.

3639
02:14:57,710 --> 02:14:58,390
We might...

3640
02:14:58,390 --> 02:15:00,950
Apparently, Gumi wants to five stack Valorant.

3641
02:15:01,090 --> 02:15:03,390
So, we might be back after I finish eating.

3642
02:15:03,970 --> 02:15:04,530
And...

3643
02:15:04,530 --> 02:15:08,250
After we finish eating and...

3644
02:15:09,470 --> 02:15:10,030
Give...

3645
02:15:10,030 --> 02:15:10,170
Give...

3646
02:15:11,150 --> 02:15:11,590
Um...

3647
02:15:12,070 --> 02:15:12,510
Um...

3648
02:15:12,510 --> 02:15:13,230
I get...

3649
02:15:13,230 --> 02:15:13,590
Uh...

3650
02:15:13,590 --> 02:15:13,890
Wait.

3651
02:15:13,990 --> 02:15:14,570
What was I going to say?

3652
02:15:15,670 --> 02:15:16,110
Fuck.

3653
02:15:16,250 --> 02:15:16,530
Oh, sorry.

3654
02:15:16,650 --> 02:15:19,790
After I finish eating, we might pop up on Gumi's stream.

3655
02:15:20,350 --> 02:15:20,790
Um...

3656
02:15:20,790 --> 02:15:22,330
And so, I'm going to give her a raid.

3657
02:15:22,490 --> 02:15:22,910
Hey guys.

3658
02:15:23,090 --> 02:15:23,870
For those who are new here.

3659
02:15:24,030 --> 02:15:25,350
I actually stream on the YouTube.

3660
02:15:25,750 --> 02:15:27,430
It's less stressful over there.

3661
02:15:27,670 --> 02:15:28,090
Um...

3662
02:15:29,150 --> 02:15:29,590
It's...

3663
02:15:29,590 --> 02:15:30,230
It's...

3664
02:15:30,230 --> 02:15:32,910
It's a lot less stressful over on the YouTube side.

3665
02:15:33,390 --> 02:15:35,110
So, check me out there.

3666
02:15:35,310 --> 02:15:36,430
If you don't want...

3667
02:15:36,430 --> 02:15:39,190
If you don't want anxiety each game.

3668
02:15:39,290 --> 02:15:40,150
Because I think...

3669
02:15:40,150 --> 02:15:41,270
I don't know how to read.

3670
02:15:41,890 --> 02:15:43,350
Check me out on the YouTube.

3671
02:15:43,750 --> 02:15:46,730

3672
02:15:47,090 --> 02:15:47,530

3675
02:15:49,930 --> 02:15:50,370

3676
02:15:50,370 --> 02:15:52,590
So, you know whenever I'm live on Twitch guys.

3677
02:15:54,250 --> 02:15:54,690

02:15:54,690 --> 02:15:55,370
And...

3679
02:15:55,370 --> 02:15:55,650
Uh...

3680
02:15:55,650 --> 02:15:55,950
What else?

3681
02:15:55,970 --> 02:15:57,230
If you want to support me through other means.

3682
02:15:57,490 --> 02:15:58,930
Please feel free to check out my merch.

3683
02:15:59,170 --> 02:15:59,630
Hey guys.

3684
02:16:01,450 --> 02:16:03,270
I can finally stop shaking.

3685
02:16:06,050 --> 02:16:09,730
I swear nothing has made me as anxious or stressed out.

3686
02:16:09,850 --> 02:16:10,130
I'm just...

3687
02:16:10,150 --> 02:16:11,230
Literally, butz this.

3688
02:16:11,450 --> 02:16:12,970
Like I don't even play Minecraft.

3689
02:16:13,330 --> 02:16:14,230
I don't know why.

3690
02:16:14,530 --> 02:16:16,530
I don't even play Minecraft.

3691
02:16:16,930 --> 02:16:19,390
Why is this so fucking nerve wracking?

3692
02:16:19,830 --> 02:16:20,470
Hey guys.

3693
02:16:20,590 --> 02:16:21,230
As always everybody.

3694
02:16:21,430 --> 02:16:22,070
Stay hydrated.

3695
02:16:22,410 --> 02:16:22,970
Posture check.

3696
02:16:23,070 --> 02:16:24,710
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

3697
02:16:24,850 --> 02:16:26,430
And if you suffer from me, head to bed.

3698
02:16:26,550 --> 02:16:27,550
Cuz you deserve it.

3699
02:16:27,650 --> 02:16:28,730
I'll see you guys next time everybody.

3700
02:16:29,270 --> 02:16:30,030
Bye guys.

3701
02:16:30,510 --> 02:16:30,910
Bye!

3702
02:18:14,820 --> 02:18:15,340
Oh yeah.

3703
02:18:15,440 --> 02:18:17,980
Forgot to say thank you for all the subs, bits and files.

3704
02:18:18,140 --> 02:18:18,280
God.

3705
02:18:18,340 --> 02:18:19,980
Sorry I've been so stressed out that...

3706
02:18:19,980 --> 02:18:21,160
I've been so forgetful.

3707
02:18:21,220 --> 02:18:22,140
So, bonus ending.

3708
02:18:22,240 --> 02:18:22,780
Thank you for watching.

3709
02:18:22,780 --> 02:18:25,180

Anyway, bye for real.
