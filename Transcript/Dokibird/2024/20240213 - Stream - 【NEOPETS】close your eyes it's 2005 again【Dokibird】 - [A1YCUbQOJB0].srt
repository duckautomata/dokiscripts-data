1
00:02:51,040 --> 00:03:03,700
hello everybody it's a little awkward that like you know the
very first gaming stream that i do is neo pets and not eight

2
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:15,540
pets look i don't know if you guys know but like neo pets
has been something i wanted to stream for like so very very

3
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:17,380
very very long

4
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:35,340
my god i can finally do it i can finally stream neopets also
apparently apparently this game um um the servers are now

5
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:47,320
very bad so most likely uh because i'm streaming neopets i
am going to clog up the server even more so that's a little

6
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:57,140
not reassuring for me so i hope that i'm actually like
explore this game by the way i have not played neopets in a

7
00:03:57,140 --> 00:04:08,140
very very very very long time the last time i've touched
neopets was when they first introduced the neopets neopets

8
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:17,200
cash mall and then they like converted all the neopets into
like these dress up dolls so like um that's around the time

9
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:28,060
i sort of quit because like i at that i was like these are
they're ugly i was just like i was like oh man they're

10
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:36,800
pretty ugly now so like i lost my enjoyment of neopets but
also because another thing that happened also gabriel thank

11
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:45,740
you for the akasupa thank you thank you happy lunar new year
cheers from hk dragoons thank you um so another reason was

12
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:55,360
that um i lost uh my main account and i was like a
billionaire on my main account and I basically what happened

13
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:06,820
was that uh I my main account got hacked um but they not
only daily hack my main neopets account but they also what

14
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:15,580
they did was they hacked my email account associated with my
main account and then they used the email account to hack

15
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:28,900
other accounts because I got the email back and I saw other
accounts associated on my email and then I the thing was

16
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:39,480
because I saw other email other accounts on my account I was
so sad that my main account got hacked that I that I logged

17
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:46,600
into the other stolen accounts to try and steal their stuff
so I can cut some things back

18
00:05:50,900 --> 00:06:03,340
I lost in my safety deposit box I had like like paint
brushes and like advent calendars from like so long ago you

19
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:14,520
don't understand and then so anyway I lost like everything
but my one unconverted pet which was a I don't know how to

20
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:21,900
pronounce it you know like those dark purple ones the
Deregans, like a Deregans, Deregans Lupe, and it was an

21
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:27,120
unconverted pet, and that was all that remains for me, for
my account value.

22
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:35,140
So anyway, after all of that happened, I, like, quit Neopets
because I, I, I was like, I lost everything.

23
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,700
I, I lost everything.

24
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,640
Why should I keep playing?

25
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,740
I don't have money anymore.

26
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:43,720
I don't have money.

27
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:47,540
I don't have, I'm nothing in my safety deposit box.

28
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:57,240
all my rare items are gone now by the way I also had had
like three other side accounts that was used as the lab ray

29
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:03,240
for those who don't know what the lab ray is it's big okay
I'm pretty sure I'm saying a lot of random words and a lot

30
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:10,540
of people don't know what I'm talking about because it's
like a lot of fucking random words and it's like jumbled up

31
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:13,420
together and they're like what the fuck is she saying

32
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:20,880
Oh my god.

33
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:23,120
Oh my god.

34
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:28,340
Um, but anyway, there is like a lot of stuff.

35
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:33,820
Uh, uh, a lot of stuff going on.

36
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:36,040
Also, a little bit of a note.

37
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:39,760
For those who are, uh, wondering.

38
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:59,280
Um, all I will say is that, uh, would say is that I will put
up another statement um and later on because uh because I

39
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:07,140
believe there are some lies being told right now and I have
further evidence and proof later on so that is all I'm gonna

40
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:13,960
say regarding this uh regarding this if there is any
anything going on there will be a future statement being

41
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:25,640
published by me later on and that will further support my
evidence and um and if you guys hear anything there is a lot

42
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:37,280
of slander and a lot of lies going on right now um and that
I will be publishing a future statement in the future

43
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:45,440
regarding it which I have evidence and receipts as well as
backed up by my lawyer so that is all i will be saying

44
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:59,800
regarding any thing that's going on at the current time um
anyway anyway all i really want to do uh all i want to do is

45
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:14,780
that uh i want to just play neopets and and regarding a
document there was a signed legal there was a signed there

46
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:24,320
was a signed legal consent between me and the management
that it was just going to be between me, my lawyer, and

47
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:24,820
management.

48
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:35,640
But the fact that they released that to others is considered
illegal because that was not supposed to be seen by anyone

49
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,020
else.

50
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:40,900
And it was signed by me, my lawyer, and other lawyers.

51
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:45,300
Um, Um, so that is all I'm gonna say.

52
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:49,900
Uh, regarding everything.

53
00:09:51,320 --> 00:10:01,860
Um, anyway, I can say this because my medical history and my
medical documents and everything that me, my lawyer, and

54
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:06,680
other people that were involved with, it was all signed and
agreed upon.

55
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:12,100
So, regarding this, um, it was very unfortunate.

56
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:15,300
that that was done.

57
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:21,080
Anyway, I do have more evidence and more receipts and more
statements later on.

58
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:24,880
Anyway, all I really want to do is play Neopets.

59
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:35,060
And nothing about that is going to stop me from playing
Neopets because Neopets brought me a lot of joy because that

60
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:42,640
document also has private information regarding me and
regarding...

61
00:10:43,820 --> 00:11:00,240
Things that should never have been public to anybody else
But me and my lawyer So That is all I'll say Um Anyway Sorry

62
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:10,120
I had to make that statement because I believe That there
was another thing that was going on at the same time And And

63
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:16,920
that Uh And that I had to make that statement.

64
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:20,400
As someone else has been messaging me about these things.

65
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,160
And I really wanted to say that out right now.

66
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:26,440
But I will be making a further statement regarding this.

67
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,940
That my lawyer has written out for me.

68
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:29,800
And has been planning.

69
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,640
And we were planning on releasing it later.

70
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,820
But because of what's going on right now.

71
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,700
We will release it sooner than later now.

72
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:37,340
Yes, I really wished.

73
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,260
I was going to.

74
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:42,340
I really wanted to move on from all of this.

75
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:54,840
but and was going to move on and everything um and was never
going to address this anymore but because they've decided to

76
00:11:54,840 --> 00:12:05,660
address it even though i wanted everything to be over with
um that is not my fault and because of this i will have to i

77
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:17,400
will have to um respond with um with a document and I have
written up just in case something like this did happen and

78
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:27,520
because of that I guess I will be releasing this document
very soon I prepared something just in case but I was going

79
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:39,840
to keep it quiet and keep it private and because that has
happened that has happened that means that I am now required

80
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:53,160
to release my story and release my statement um and i'm very
very saddened that my privacy was violated with this as this

81
00:12:53,160 --> 00:13:01,980
document that they're saying was never supposed to be out
between other than between me and my lawyer and um and the

82
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:10,780
other lawyers so um we signed it and said that it was
supposed to be kept between us and the fact that they did

83
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:14,620
not keep that promise and the fact that they released it to
public.

84
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:23,380
And the fact that people that shouldn't have been reading
this read it and has my private information regarding it.

85
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:24,860
Um...

86
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:26,640
I was very unfortunate.

87
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:30,580
Um...

88
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:35,180
So I try to leave on very... On as good terms as I can.

89
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:38,300
Um...

90
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:39,820
So yeah.

91
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:50,260
I I'm very, it's very unfortunate that this happened while,
while I, I wanted to have a good first week.

92
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:54,420
And, um, and like I said, this is the only thing I would
say.

93
00:13:55,040 --> 00:14:01,900
And, um, my lawyer and I will release the document that we
prepared, that we were preparing in case something like this

94
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:02,760
did happen.

95
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:03,940
Yep.

96
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:04,480
All right.

97
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,480
That's all I'll say.

98
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:07,440
Uh.

99
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:24,140
Anyway, anyway, let us, let us create our neoped, as we all
know.

100
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:30,820
I wanted to create a, I wanted to create a peturi.

101
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:40,020
I really wanted to create a peturi.

102
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:53,860
a Pateri also I'll also say that I've heard slander about me
behind the scenes and outright lies being told about me but

103
00:14:53,860 --> 00:15:01,960
what they do not know is that I have receipts that this
proves a lot of things that were said about me behind the

104
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:13,800
scenes and it's very unfortunate that had to make that
public that will have to make it public like later on um yes

105
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:20,360
anyway so yes uh i really really wanted to uh

106
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:41,900
um i really really wanted to do uh do a beteri and because
it is i felt like that fits um that really and I think like

107
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:48,920
because of all of this happening I believe I will have to
talk to my lawyer after the stream so we're gonna keep this

108
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:59,900
stream very short but everything else will be on scheduled
everything else will be on scheduled from here and um and

109
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:05,400
for so tomorrow I'm still going to do the apex season launch
and everything else will be kept on schedule but

110
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:13,120
unfortunately unfortunately because of everything that's
going on I will have to talk to my lawyer and I want to talk

111
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:19,260
to my lawyer about all of this and finish up the document
that we have been working on.

112
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,580
So that's very unfortunate.

113
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:28,800
I really wanted to have a good first stream starting this
week but because of timing I really want to keep everything

114
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:40,080
private and really wanted to move on from here but it was
very unfortunate that all of this happened so I will try my

115
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:47,880
best to make up for you guys and we will try to have another
neopet stream in the future but for now let us just make the

116
00:16:47,880 --> 00:17:03,160
tricoon i guess i really do thank all of you guys uh i
really do thank all of you guys for uh for being here and

117
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:16,280
for believing in me and everything um a lot uh i really do
appreciate it everybody um despite everything that has

118
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:29,760
happened it i was very sad to find out a personal document
that was only shown between three different parties had to

119
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:44,780
be uh leaked out um because it was a document i made for my
lawyer and it was a document that was not supposed to be

120
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:46,980
shown anywhere else.

121
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:58,540
But to me and my lawyer and to the lawyers on the other
side, and we were promised it was not to be shown anywhere

122
00:17:58,540 --> 00:17:59,100
else.

123
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:12,260
So the fact that, and this was a document that was made that
was supposed to help me figure out what was going on between

124
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:18,680
me and my lawyer and to see if things that were happening
was actually happening.

125
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:29,680
And then we showed it to the other, the lawyers just to see,
to see if like they can figure out if what was going on was

126
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,520
actually happening.

127
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:35,500
And we were promised it was never going to show, be shown
anywhere else.

128
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:46,480
So the fact and the fact that this has happened really
messes me up because I have said that I felt a very lack of

129
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,480
trust for a while.

130
00:18:51,220 --> 00:19:01,360
And I'm just left speechless that my trust has been broken
again regarding what I've thought was kept private.

131
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:07,760
That's really it.

132
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:13,820
And for a statement regarding all of this, I will talk to my
lawyer.

133
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:16,920
And we will be releasing another statement about this later
on.

134
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:19,500
Oh, all right.

135
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:27,510
Anyway.

136
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:30,610
Sorry.

137
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:37,550
I'm just happy that I just got a friend that messaged me.

138
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:48,770
I was just saying that they're there for me with all this
happening so it's really reassuring to know that my friends

139
00:19:48,770 --> 00:20:02,030
are still there for me after all of this and uh and I'm just
really happy that like they're still there they're seeing

140
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:13,450
what's happening and you know what's going on and they're
still there through uh there to support me oh anyway um i'm

141
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:26,290
just gonna name we're just gonna it's really sad because i
was really looking forward to neopets i was really i was

142
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:38,370
really looking forward to neopets i was ready to move on
with everything um but yes uh Um, my lawyer is ready to talk

143
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:40,110
to me soon now, so...

144
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:48,910
My lawyer is ready to talk to me soon, so I'm gonna have to
call it here, guys.

145
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:50,130
I'm really sorry.

146
00:20:51,010 --> 00:20:55,110
I'm really sorry with everything, so...

147
00:20:56,850 --> 00:20:57,530
Um...

148
00:20:57,530 --> 00:20:59,910
I'm sorry that I had to cut this short.

149
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:05,030
I was really looking forward to moving on and rebuilding
myself.

150
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:16,150
so um it is it's very unfortunate it really says a lot
