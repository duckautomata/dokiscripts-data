00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,740
Hello everybody!

2
00:02:54,200 --> 00:03:03,840
It's a little awkward that like, you know, the very first gaming stream that I do is Neopets and not Inkpens.

3
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:17,200
Look, I don't know if you guys know, but like Neopets has been something I wanted to stream for like so very, very, very, very long.

4
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:23,440
And I was like, oh my god, I can finally do it!

5
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:26,160
I can finally stream Neopets!

6
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:36,040
Also, apparently, apparently this game... the servers are now very bad.

7
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:45,800
So most likely, because I'm streaming Neopets, I am going to clog up the server even more.

8
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,180
So that's a little...

9
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,920
not reassuring for me.

10
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:52,460
So I hope that I'm actually able to like explore this game.

11
00:03:52,600 --> 00:04:00,080
By the way, I have not played Neopets in a very, very, very, very, very long time.

12
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:08,820
The last time I've touched Neopets was when they first introduced the Neopets cash mall.

13
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:13,860
And then they like converted all the Neopets into like these dress-up dolls.

14
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:17,080
So like, that's around the time...

15
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:18,120
I sort of quit.

16
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:20,220
Because like, I thought...

17
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:21,720
I was like, these are...

18
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,160
they're ugly.

19
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,300
I was just like...

20
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:29,380
I was like, oh man, they're pretty ugly now.

21
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,540
So like, I lost my enjoyment of Neopets.

22
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:36,000
But also because another thing that happened...

23
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,820
Also Gabriel, thank you for the Akasufa!

24
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:38,780
Thank you, thank you!

25
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:40,280
Happy Lunar New Year!

26
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:41,820
Cheers from HK Dragoons!

27
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:42,480
Thank you!

28
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,140
So another reason was that...

29
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:46,680
um...

30
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:49,320
I lost my main account.

31
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:52,320
And I was like a billionaire on my main account.

32
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:54,340
And I basically...

33
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:56,540
What happened was that...

34
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:59,700
my main account got hacked.

35
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:04,280
But they not only daily hacked my main Neopets account.

36
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,060
But they also...

37
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:12,020
What they did was they hacked my email account associated with my main account.

38
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:16,520
And then they used the email account to hack other accounts.

39
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:19,320
Because I got the email back.

40
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,320
And I saw other...

41
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:25,740
I saw other accounts associated on my email.

42
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,280
And then I...

43
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,640
The thing was...

44
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:31,340
Because I saw other email...

45
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:33,760
Other accounts on my account...

46
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:37,260
I was so sad that my main account got hacked.

47
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,320
That I...

48
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:43,260
That I logged into the other stolen accounts to try and steal their stuff.

49
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:46,340
So I kept cutting some things back.

50
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:49,180
And then I was like...

51
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:50,320
No you don't understand!

52
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,440
I lost...

53
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,680
In my safety deposit box...

54
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:56,660
I had like...

55
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:58,160
Like paint brushes.

56
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,440
And like advent calendars.

57
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,360
From like...

58
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,840
So long ago.

59
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,220
You don't understand.

60
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:07,840
So anyway...

61
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,500
I lost like everything.

62
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:12,420
But my one unconverted pet.

63
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:13,980
Which was a...

64
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:15,040
I don't know how to pronounce it.

65
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:15,600
You know like those...

66
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,600
Dark purple...

67
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:16,960
Wolf ones.

68
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:18,020
The Darragons.

69
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:19,580
Like a Darragon...

70
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:20,580
Darragon Lupe.

71
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:22,800
And it was an unconverted pet.

72
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,600
And that was all that remains for me.

73
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,720
For my account value.

74
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,160
So anyway...

75
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,800
After all of that happened.

76
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,500
I like quit Neopets.

77
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,460
Because I...

78
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,960
I was like...

79
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:34,800
I lost everything.

80
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:35,900
I...

81
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:37,360
I lost everything.

82
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,460
Why should I keep playing?

83
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,540
I don't have money anymore.

84
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,440
I don't have money.

85
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:44,900
I don't have...

86
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:46,040
I have nothing in my...

87
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,480
My safety deposit box.

88
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:50,400
All my rare items are gone now.

89
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,460
By the way...

90
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:54,880
I also had like 3 other side accounts.

91
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,040
That was used as the Labre.

92
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:59,540
For those who don't know what the Labre is...

93
00:06:59,540 --> 00:06:59,940
It's big...

94
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:02,260
Okay, I'm pretty sure I'm saying a lot of random words.

95
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:05,400
And a lot of people don't know what I'm talking about.

96
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,060
Because it's like a lot of fucking random words.

97
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,760
And it's like jumbled up together.

98
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:13,080
And they're like, what the fuck is she saying?

99
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,080
Hahaha...

100
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:20,520
Oh my god.

101
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:22,640
Oh my god.

102
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:28,060
But anyway, there is like a lot of stuff.

103
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:33,620
A lot of stuff going on.

104
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:35,820
Also, a little bit of a note.

105
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:39,340
For those who are wondering.

106
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:44,620
All I will say is that...

107
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:54,560
All I will say is that I will put up another statement later on.

108
00:07:55,120 --> 00:08:01,420
Because I believe there are some lies being told right now.

109
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:05,480
And I have further evidence and proof later on.

110
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:08,340
So that is all I'm going to say regarding this.

111
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,320
Uh...

112
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:14,660
Regarding this, if there is anything going on, there will be a future statement being published by me.

113
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,160
Later on.

114
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:20,000
And that will further support my evidence.

115
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:28,840
And if you guys hear anything, there is a lot of slander and a lot of lies going on right now.

116
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:38,380
And that I will be publishing a future statement in the future regarding it.

117
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:40,800
Which I have evidence and receipts.

118
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:43,240
As well as backed up by my lawyer.

119
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:49,400
So that is all I will be saying regarding anything that is going on at the current time.

120
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:50,580
Um...

121
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:51,660
Anyway...

122
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:54,380
Anyway, all I really want to do...

123
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,240
Uh...

124
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:00,300
All I want to do is that...

125
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:01,140
Uh...

126
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,680
I want to just play Neopets.

127
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:06,420
And...

128
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,200
And regarding a...

129
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,120
Document...

130
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,520
There was a signed legal...

131
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,460
There was a signed...

132
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:14,700
Doc...

133
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:18,980
There was a signed legal consent between me and the management.

134
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:24,660
That it was just going to be between me, my lawyer, and management.

135
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:31,300
But the fact that they released that to others is considered illegal.

136
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,840
Because that was not supposed to be seen by anyone else.

137
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:38,020
And it was signed by me.

138
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:38,980
My lawyer.

139
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,680
And other lawyers.

140
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:42,840
Um...

141
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:45,100
So that is all I'm going to say.

142
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:47,500
Uh...

143
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,260
Regarding everything.

144
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,280
Um...

145
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,500
Anyway...

146
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:53,500
Um...

147
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,340
I can say this because...

148
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:59,120
My medical history and my medical documents and everything...

149
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:02,260
That me, my lawyer, and other...

150
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:04,600
Other people that were involved with...

151
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,420
It was all signed and agreed upon.

152
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:07,840
So...

153
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,580
Regarding this...

154
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:10,720
Um...

155
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,240
It was very unfortunate...

156
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,320
That...

157
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,760
That was done.

158
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,480
Anyway...

159
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:20,820
I do have more evidence and more receipts and more statements later on.

160
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:24,800
Anyway, all I really want to do is play Neopets.

161
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,460
And nothing about that is going to stop me from playing Neopets.

162
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:32,740
Because Neopets brought me a lot of joy.

163
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,080
Um...

164
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,700
Because that document...

165
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,620
Also has...

166
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:40,240
Private information regarding me.

167
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,720
And regarding...

168
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,720
Uh...

169
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:47,200
Things that should never have been public to anybody else.

170
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,460
But me and my lawyer.

171
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:52,620
So...

172
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:54,180
That is all I'll say.

173
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:56,280
Um...

174
00:10:58,820 --> 00:10:59,340
Anyway...

175
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:01,300
Uh... Sorry, I had to make that statement.

176
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,460
Because I believe that...

177
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:04,060
Uh...

178
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:06,280
There was another thing that was going on at the same time.

179
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,280
And...

180
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:10,880
And that...

181
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:12,620
Uh...

182
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:13,780
Uh...

183
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:14,780
And that...

184
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:15,320
Um...

185
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,760
I had to make that statement.

186
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:20,240
As someone else has been messaging me about these things.

187
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:20,860
And...

188
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:22,940
I really wanted to say that out right now.

189
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:26,220
But I will be making a further statement regarding this.

190
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,700
That my lawyer has written out for me.

191
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:29,860
And has been planning...

192
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:31,460
And we were planning on releasing it later.

193
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,660
But because of what's going on right now.

194
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,460
We will release it sooner than later now.

195
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:36,220
Uh...

196
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:37,420
Yes, I really wished...

197
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:39,240
I was going to...

198
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,160
I really wanted to move on from all of this.

199
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:43,460
But...

200
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:45,500
And was going to move on.

201
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:46,300
And everything.

202
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,320
Um...

203
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,120
And was never going to address this anymore.

204
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:52,920
But because...

205
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,340
They've decided to address it.

206
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,600
Even though I wanted everything...

207
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,980
To be over with.

208
00:11:59,340 --> 00:11:59,940
Um...

209
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:01,340
That is not my fault.

210
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:02,660
And...

211
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:04,760
Because of this, I will have to...

212
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,640
I will have to...

213
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,420
Um...

214
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:08,420
Respond...

215
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:09,960
With...

216
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:10,620
Um...

217
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:14,120
With a document that my lawyer and I have written up.

218
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,340
Just in case something like this did happen.

219
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,960
And because of that...

220
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:19,840
Um...

221
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:23,260
I guess I will be releasing this document very soon.

222
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:24,460
Um...

223
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:26,340
I prepared something just in case.

224
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:28,940
But I was going to keep it quiet.

225
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,020
And keep it private.

226
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:32,960
And because that has happened...

227
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:34,420
Um...

228
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:36,400
That has happened.

229
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,580
That means that I am now...

230
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:41,160
Required to release my story.

231
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,460
And release my statement.

232
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:44,060
Um...

233
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,700
And I'm very, very saddened.

234
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:50,800
That my privacy was violated with this.

235
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:51,980
As...

236
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:54,380
This document that they're saying...

237
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:56,600
Was never supposed to be out between...

238
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:59,080
Other than between me and my lawyer.

239
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:00,340
And...

240
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:01,200
Um...

241
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,420
And the other lawyers.

242
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,160
So...

243
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,320
Um...

244
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:08,140
We signed it and said that it was supposed to be kept between us.

245
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:11,680
And the fact that they did not keep that promise.

246
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:14,340
And the fact that they released it to public.

247
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,780
And the fact that like...

248
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:18,720
People that shouldn't have been reading this...

249
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,320
Read it.

250
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:22,380
And has my private information regarding it.

251
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:24,060
Um...

252
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:26,320
That was very unfortunate.

253
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:30,400
Um...

254
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,300
So I try to leave on very...

255
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:34,140
As good as I can.

256
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,080
Um...

257
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:39,680
So yeah.

258
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:40,560
I'm very...

259
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,380
It's very unfortunate that this happened.

260
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:43,700
While...

261
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:44,800
While...

262
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,240
I...

263
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,720
I wanted to have a good...

264
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:49,980
First week.

265
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:51,240
And...

266
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:51,980
Um...

267
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:54,200
And like I said, this is the only thing I will say.

268
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:55,420
And...

269
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:55,900
Um...

270
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,740
My lawyer and I will release...

271
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:59,100
The document that we prepared.

272
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,380
That we were preparing.

273
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:01,740
In case something like this...

274
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:02,460
Did happen.

275
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:03,880
Yep.

276
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:04,120
So...

277
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:05,260
Alright, that's all I'll say.

278
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:07,840
Uh...

279
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:10,560
Um...

280
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:13,210
Anyway...

281
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:15,210
Anyway...

282
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,100
Uh...

283
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:19,320
Let us...

284
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:20,900
Let us...

285
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:22,600
Create our Neopad.

286
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:23,940
As we all know.

287
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,440
I wanted to create a...

288
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,480
Um...

289
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,860
I wanted to create a...

290
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:30,740
Pateri.

291
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:41,820
I really wanted to create a Pateri.

292
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:50,520
Also, I'll also say that I've heard slander about me behind the scenes.

293
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:53,120
And outright lies being told about me.

294
00:14:53,320 --> 00:15:02,120
But what they do not know is that I have receipts that this proves a lot of things that were said about me behind the scenes.

295
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:07,140
And it's very unfortunate that I had to make that public.

296
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:10,840
That we'll have to make it public later on.

297
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,080
Yes, anyway.

298
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:19,520
So yes, I really, really wanted to...

299
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:27,560
I really, really, really wanted to do...

300
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:31,440
Do a Pateri.

301
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:34,320
And because it is...

302
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,900
I felt like that fits...

303
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:39,880
That really fits the Dragoons.

304
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:43,560
And I think like because of all of this happening...

305
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:47,540
I believe I will have to talk to my lawyer after the stream.

306
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:49,720
So we're going to keep this stream very short.

307
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,460
But everything else will be on schedule.

308
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:55,880
Everything else will be on schedule from here.

309
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:57,340
And...

310
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:02,100
And for tomorrow, I'm still going to do the Apex Legends.

311
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:02,620
Season launch.

312
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,860
And everything else will be kept on schedule.

313
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:06,340
But unfortunately...

314
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,880
Unfortunately, because of everything that's going on...

315
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,440
I will have to talk to my lawyer.

316
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:11,520
And...

317
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:14,460
I will have to talk to my lawyer about all of this.

318
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:18,620
And finish up the document that we have been working on.

319
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,460
So that's very unfortunate.

320
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:25,640
I really wanted to have a good first stream starting this week.

321
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:27,180
But because of timing...

322
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:29,280
I really want to keep everything private.

323
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:31,320
And really wanted to move on from here.

324
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:35,860
But it was very unfortunate that all of this happened.

325
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:37,920
So...

326
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:41,360
I will try my best to make up for you guys.

327
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,640
And we will try to have another Neopets stream in the future.

328
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:45,960
But for now...

329
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:49,140
Let us just make the Dragoon, I guess.

330
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:55,540
I really do thank all of you guys.

331
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:59,180
I really do thank all of you guys for...

332
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,300
For being here.

333
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:04,980
And for believing in me.

334
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:06,080
And everything.

335
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:08,960
A lot of...

336
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:11,640
I really do appreciate it.

337
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:12,080
Everybody.

338
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,520
Despite everything that has happened.

339
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:21,300
I was very sad to find out...

340
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:28,280
A personal document that was only shown between three different parties.

341
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:30,220
Had to be leaked.

342
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:31,740
And leaked out.

343
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:33,420
Umm...

344
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:36,160
Because it was...

345
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,340
A document I made...

346
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:39,880
For my lawyer.

347
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:43,080
And it was a document...

348
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:45,480
That was not supposed to be shown...

349
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,720
Anywhere else.

350
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,800
But to me...

351
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:49,880
And my lawyer...

352
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:52,720
And to the lawyers...

353
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,540
On the other side.

354
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:56,060
And we were promised...

355
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:57,500
It was not to be shown...

356
00:17:58,060 --> 00:17:58,860
Anywhere else.

357
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,620
So the fact...

358
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:01,980
That...

359
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:02,900
Umm...

360
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:04,420
And this was...

361
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:05,960
A document that was made...

362
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:08,000
That was supposed to...

363
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,880
Help me figure out...

364
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:10,960
What was going on...

365
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,080
Between me and my lawyer.

366
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:14,860
And to see if...

367
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:16,960
Things that were happening...

368
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,440
Was actually happening.

369
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:21,600
And then we showed it to...

370
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,520
The other...

371
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,520
The lawyers...

372
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,560
Just to see...

373
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,740
To see if like...

374
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:27,580
They can...

375
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:29,420
Figure out if what was going on...

376
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:30,340
Was actually happening.

377
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:31,540
And we were promised...

378
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,280
It was never going to show...

379
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:33,940
Be shown...

380
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:35,260
Anywhere else.

381
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,440
So the fact...

382
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,380
And the fact...

383
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:40,360
That this has happened...

384
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:41,680
Really...

385
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,960
Messes me up.

386
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,640
Because I have said...

387
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,520
That I felt...

388
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,180
A very lack of trust...

389
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:48,280
For a while.

390
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:50,260
And...

391
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:51,140
Umm...

392
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:51,540
I...

393
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:52,100
I...

394
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:53,860
I'm just left speechless...

395
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,280
That...

396
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:55,980
That...

397
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:57,140
My trust has been...

398
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:57,840
Broken again.

399
00:18:58,620 --> 00:18:59,260
Regarding...

400
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:00,320
What I've thought...

401
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,140
Was kept private.

402
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:03,700
Umm...

403
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:05,100
So...

404
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:05,560
Yeah...

405
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:06,340
Umm...

406
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:07,180
That's really...

407
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:07,680
It...

408
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,440
And...

409
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:08,920
Further...

410
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:09,540
Statement...

411
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:10,220
Regarding...

412
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:11,120
All of this...

413
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,480
I will...

414
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,880
Talk to my lawyer...

415
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:14,380
And...

416
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:15,180
We will be releasing...

417
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:15,820
Another statement...

418
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:16,320
About this...

419
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:16,760
Later on.

420
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:19,520
Alright...

421
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:20,520
Alright...

422
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:23,760
Umm...

423
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:26,650
Uhh...

424
00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:27,710
Anyway...

425
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:28,810
Umm...

426
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:30,710
Sorry...

427
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:31,090
Haha...

428
00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:31,950
I'm sorry...

429
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:33,150
I'm just happy that...

430
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:35,030
Umm...

431
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:37,590
I just got a friend that messaged me...

432
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:39,610
That I was just saying...

433
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:41,650
That they're there for me...

434
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:43,290
With all of this happening...

435
00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:43,590
So...

436
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:45,190
It was really reassuring...

437
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:46,290
To know...

438
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:47,310
That...

439
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:48,870
My friends...

440
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:50,230
Are still there for me...

441
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:51,510
After all of this...

442
00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:53,410
And...

443
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:54,990
Uhh...

444
00:19:56,010 --> 00:19:56,610
And...

445
00:19:56,610 --> 00:19:59,850
I'm just really happy that...

446
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:00,670
Like...

447
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:01,470
They're still there...

448
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:01,950
And they're seeing me...

449
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:02,810
And they're seeing what's happening...

450
00:20:02,810 --> 00:20:03,350
And they know...

451
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:04,650
What's going on...

452
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:05,070
And...

453
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:06,790
They're still there through...

454
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:07,210
Uhh...

455
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:09,210
There to support me...

456
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:10,850
Oh...

457
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:11,230
Anyway...

458
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:12,770
Umm...

459
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:14,250
I'm just gonna name...

460
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:15,070
Haha...

461
00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:18,370
We're just gonna...

462
00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:19,890
It's really sad...

463
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:22,310
Cause I was really looking forward to Neopets...

464
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:23,570
I was really...

465
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:23,730
Haha...

466
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:26,510
I was really...

467
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:27,030
Haha...

468
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:29,250
Looking forward to Neopets...

469
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:30,910
I was ready to move on...

470
00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:31,950
With everything...

471
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:33,630
Um...

472
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:34,410
But yes...

473
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:34,950
Uhh...

474
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:35,970
Umm...

475
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:39,090
My lawyer is ready to talk to me now!

476
00:20:39,730 --> 00:20:40,050
Sooo...

477
00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:40,530
Hahaha...

478
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:41,830
Haha...

479
00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:46,230
My lawyer is ready to talk to me soon...

480
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:48,090
So I'm gonna have to call it here.

481
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:48,910
Guys...

482
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:50,230
I'm really sorry...

483
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:51,770
I'm really...

484
00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:52,630
Sorry...

485
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:53,870
With everything...

486
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:54,570
So...

487
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:56,270
Umm...

488
00:20:57,430 --> 00:20:59,970
I'm sorry that I had to cut this short...

489
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:00,630
I...

490
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:04,730
I was really looking forward to moving on and rebuilding myself.

491
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:08,510
So, it is...

492
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:10,050
It's very unfortunate.

493
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:12,250
It really says a lot though.

494
00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:17,450
That people would try to bring down others when people are ready to move on.

495
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:20,210
It really says a lot.

496
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:25,710
So I'm just gonna call it here.

497
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:26,510
Thank you everybody.

498
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:28,670
I'm sorry that we couldn't really have...

499
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:31,450
We couldn't really...

500
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:37,010
We couldn't really have this Neopets stream.

501
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:38,450
I was really looking forward to it.

502
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:40,810
And I guess I'll...

503
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,910
See you guys later everybody.

504
00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:44,090
Bye guys.
