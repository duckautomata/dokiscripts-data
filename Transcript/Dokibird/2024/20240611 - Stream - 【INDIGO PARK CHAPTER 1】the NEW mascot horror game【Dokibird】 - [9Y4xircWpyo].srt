00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:51,050
Hello everybody!

2
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:53,810
I'm back on YouTube!

3
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:55,490
Yay!

4
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:03,230
Alright, for those who don't know, we're like, oh my god, Doki, we missed you!

5
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:05,650
I hope you had a great rest week!

6
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:09,350
Has not been follow- does not have a Twitter account.

7
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:16,510
Because we're doing- we're resting.

8
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:18,350
What is that?

9
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:30,050
So I'm gonna update the YouTube people who are not familiar with what's going on on Twitter or, you know, on the other streaming platform, Twitch.

10
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:38,910
Anyway, so basically, if you're like just primarily on YouTube, which is understandable because Twitter's a hot mess.

11
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:40,010
It's understandable.

12
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:43,830
What new drama is on Twitter today?

13
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:44,630
Wow!

14
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:48,930
It's understandable if you're not on Twitter and you didn't realize what's going on.

15
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:52,870
And if you're not- if you don't follow me on Twitch, it's perfectly understandable.

16
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:57,570
Basically, so I joined a Minecraft Twitch Rivals.

17
00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:00,030
And it ended up...

18
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:04,570
I thought I was gonna be eliminated at best at the second day.

19
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:09,710
I thought after two days of it, it'll be over.

20
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:17,030
But instead, I ended up making it all the way to day four with no prize money.

21
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:17,750
So...

22
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:20,210
Do not worry!

23
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:25,050
We're actually getting that compiled into a... into a video.

24
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:29,570
But it's taking a bit because my video editors are also working on the WrestleTuber.

25
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:31,750
And also on...

26
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:33,790
Wait, what was the other...

27
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:35,610
What was the other thing that I did?

28
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:36,130
Oh, Tekken!

29
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:36,370
Yeah!

30
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:37,290
I'm sorry!

31
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:41,770
I've had like so many back-to-back-to-back-to-back events.

32
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:43,650
Legitimate Tekken...

33
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:47,730
Did you guys know Tekken was like three weeks... two weeks ago, I think?

34
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:51,470
I think Tekken was like two to three weeks ago, by the way, guys.

35
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:54,270
But it felt like it happened two months ago.

36
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:58,470
So...

37
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:01,210
So we had...

38
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:01,650
We have two...

39
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:04,490
I have two editors who do like main videos.

40
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:10,190
And they're already working on WrestleTuber and the Tekken Sajam Slam.

41
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:11,950
So that's why like...

42
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:15,870
The Minecraft video might be a while before it comes out.

43
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:20,010
Yeah, it was literally three weeks ago.

44
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:21,990
WrestleTuber was two weeks ago.

45
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:25,230
And then the Minecraft arc was last week.

46
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:26,230
Oh my God.

47
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:27,070
Anyway!

48
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:30,230
And then we have another announcement this week too.

49
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:35,350
So yes, before we play the game, it's time to give you updates!

50
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:36,670
It's update time!

51
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:40,470
So people who are just here to be like, Doki, we just want to watch you play the game.

52
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:45,410
Come back in 20 minutes because usually I'm fucking giving updates on life.

53
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:51,990
So take 20 minutes before I finish giving you a life update.

54
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:58,090
But yes, we're just trying to give the YouTube people up to speed on everything.

55
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:01,630
But basically...

56
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:07,010
Basically, I had four days of Minecraft.

57
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:13,010
And like, you know, it was 150 people that joined in.

58
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:14,910
And then I got eliminated at what?

59
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:15,970
Number 60 something?

60
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:16,890
67th?

61
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:19,170
I got eliminated at 67th place.

62
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:20,230
Spoilers!

63
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:21,490
I don't care.

64
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:26,070
I think I literally tweeted it out anyway that I got eliminated.

65
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:27,010
Like, you know what?

66
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:30,810
It's day four out of like five days.

67
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:32,510
Like, come on.

68
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:42,170
It's 150 people all the way to like one person wins 70,000.

69
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:42,830
What was it?

70
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:44,130
Was it $70,000?

71
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:45,490
Was it?

72
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:51,750
I always say that out loud, but it's actually fucking crazy that it's $70,000 for first place.

73
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:53,710
And like people who get...

74
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:56,310
But like people on day four get nothing.

75
00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:59,130
Day one to four, people get nothing.

76
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:01,950
It's actually crazy.

77
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:06,170
I thought I would get eliminated in two days, you know?

78
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:09,530
Because I joined in thinking like, well, I'm not a Minecraft player.

79
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:11,850
I'm totally going to get eliminated in two days.

80
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:13,550
So it's like, that's fine.

81
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:15,430
Like at best, I'll make it to day two.

82
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:17,670
And then I have the rest of the week off.

83
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:19,610
But then I made it to day four.

84
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:21,490
And every day was fucking wild.

85
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:26,730
Like it was like a four to five hours each day.

86
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:35,930
And like it got so bad that actual drama came out of the Minecraft event.

87
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:37,670
Because people were...

88
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,100
Because some...

89
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:42,180
Okay, so like the events were very poor.

90
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:45,760
Like some of the events were incredibly poorly programmed.

91
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:47,880
Yes, Gumi hard carried me, by the way.

92
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,860
I would have got hard eliminated.

93
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:54,520
And then Gumi dragged me through the finish line for like three days straight.

94
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:55,860
It was terrible.

95
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,280
Because, okay, do you know why?

96
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:05,780
It's because Gumi got invited to Shroud's birthday party.

97
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,280
You know, like Shroud's 30th birthday party.

98
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,260
Where they're fucking...

99
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:10,420
They were doing that Fallout...

100
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:12,280
The Fallout themed birthday party.

101
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:16,900
So she got invited to Shroud's birthday party.

102
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:22,020
But she had to reject the invite for the Minecraft witch rivals.

103
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,300
And you know at the end...

104
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:27,860
At the end of it, she was like, I wish I didn't.

105
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:34,840
She was like, I could have been at Shroud's birthday party.

106
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:39,240
So she dragged me along to something.

107
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:46,820
She literally could have gone to Shroud's big three.

108
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:47,460
I know!

109
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:49,600
I was so surprised at Shroud's 32.

110
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,140
I thought he was like 40 or something.

111
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:52,700
I'm so sorry.

112
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:55,020
But like, I don't know what happened.

113
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:57,180
I feel like gaming really aged him.

114
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,800
I thought he was 40.

115
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,640
I did not realize he was 30.

116
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:04,580
He seemed...

117
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:06,320
I didn't even knew that.

118
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:08,420
And I was like, his big three?

119
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:10,340
Oh, he's 30?

120
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:18,440
Because everyone was like, oh yeah, Shroud's so old now.

121
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:20,920
And so then I always think like...

122
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:23,980
I always think he's like, you know, late 30s.

123
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:26,340
You know, because everyone always calls him old.

124
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,760
Or like, and he's been around for a really long time.

125
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:32,740
You know, he's been around for so long.

126
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:35,920
And then just to find out he's 30.

127
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:37,680
And I'm like, oh my God.

128
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,180
People think 30...

129
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:42,160
Okay, to be fair, in gaming history...

130
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:46,260
Okay, to be fair, in gaming, I thought like people...

131
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:50,740
A lot of people say like, you know, 30 is new old for esports.

132
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,720
And like for esports, which is sort of true.

133
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:58,980
It's sort of true because all the Fortnite pros are like fucking 13 and everything.

134
00:08:59,360 --> 00:08:59,900
So...

135
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:04,160
Yeah.

136
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:09,120
So like, I guess like when you're comparing the young blood, the 13.

137
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,880
And the 17 year old esports pros.

138
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,180
It makes sense.

139
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:16,740
You know, like 30 is usually the time when like esports players start to retire.

140
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,820
And just become content creators.

141
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:21,340
Because like you also make more money.

142
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:26,660
As a content creator as well.

143
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,140
I didn't say I thought 30 was old.

144
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:29,900
I was surprised.

145
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:31,140
I was so surprised.

146
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:32,660
Because that he's 30.

147
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:36,260
Because a lot of people keep saying that Shroud is old.

148
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:38,380
And he's been around for fucking decades.

149
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,760
He's actually been around the scene for decades.

150
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,320
I didn't realize he popped off at 16.

151
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:45,460
Guys.

152
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,260
I didn't realize.

153
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,060
He like popped off at 16.

154
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:53,140
That's why he's been around for so long.

155
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,160
And so I was so surprised.

156
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:56,980
I was like, oh my god, he's only 30.

157
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,000
Wow.

158
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:01,660
Not like, oh my god, I can't believe he's fucking 30 retire.

159
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,720
I mean like, oh my god, he's 30.

160
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:04,560
That's so young.

161
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:05,540
Hahaha.

162
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:07,460
Hahaha.

163
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:07,640
Hahaha.

164
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:10,340
That's what I mean, guys.

165
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,860
That's what I mean.

166
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:15,660
Anyway.

167
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:17,340
Um.

168
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:18,580
Um.

169
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:19,520
But yeah, anyway.

170
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,280
So like, I was so surprised to find out he was 30.

171
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,980
Because he was a lot younger than I thought.

172
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:25,520
I literally thought he was 40.

173
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:26,540
Hahaha.

174
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:30,660
I thought he was a really insane FPS gamer at 40.

175
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:34,460
I was like, oh my god, that man still has his reflexes at 40?

176
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:35,660
Holy shit.

177
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:36,520
Hahaha.

178
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:38,980
A lot of people would want that.

179
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,320
And then I find out he's 30.

180
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:43,320
And I was like, oh my god, he is so much younger than I expected.

181
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:48,780
Because I felt like, I feel like CSGO really, I mean, CSGO and Valorant can age anybody.

182
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:50,460
So like, I don't blame him.

183
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:51,580
I...

184
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:52,460
Hahaha.

185
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,200
He's still got...

186
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,740
I don't blame him.

187
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:58,600
Um.

188
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:00,940
What pro FPS dude.

189
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:06,500
I mean, being put up with like, fucking, like, Cry Baby Valorant.

190
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:10,740
I mean, I would age 20 years too after that.

191
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:12,020
Hahaha.

192
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,520
We were talking about Trou.

193
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:15,380
Um.

194
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:16,880
Kaz thank you for the super chat.

195
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:17,520
Thank you, thank you.

196
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:18,800
30s is the new 20 guys.

197
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:20,260
Our life is just starting.

198
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,220
Being 30 is being so.

199
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:22,840
That is true.

200
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:27,600
The longer our lifespan, the 30s is practically the new 20s.

201
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,820
Guys, we're not dying at the age of 40 anymore.

202
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,820
This is not like the 1800s.

203
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:32,460
Guys.

204
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:35,980
We gotta remember it's not the 1800s anymore.

205
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:36,480
Guys.

206
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,740
We can live past 40 chat.

207
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,080
Hahaha.

208
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:46,660
We don't have to have kids at the age of 15 anymore guys.

209
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:52,760
We don't have to keep popping the babies out to work in the factories to earn money for the family.

210
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:55,940
Like, factories can't even employ children anymore.

211
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:57,880
I think.

212
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:04,340
Well, certain countries don't do it because of ethical reasons.

213
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,320
Hahaha.

214
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:05,920
Hahaha.

215
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:06,460
Hahaha.

216
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:09,560
Don't research your chocolate brand.

217
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:10,980
Hahaha.

218
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:13,580
Um.

219
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:15,340
Fiction.

220
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:16,700
Thank you for the super chat.

221
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,140
Thank you.

222
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:17,580
Thank you.

223
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:24,580
In the past life, I asked you if you can play Spec Ops Align but it's been delisted for some time now so you can unless you find a physical copy.

224
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:25,400
Thank you for the super chat.

225
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:25,760
Thank you.

226
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:26,420
Thank you.

227
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:27,180
Uh.

228
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:29,060
Mitchie, thank you for the super chat.

229
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:29,360
Thank you.

230
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:29,720
Thank you.

231
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:30,300
Congratulate.

232
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:34,700
Congrats to random Vtuber number 13 for making it to the top half.

233
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:35,740
Thank you for the super chat.

234
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:36,060
Thank you.

235
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:36,780
Thank you.

236
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:37,740
Thank you.

237
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:38,660
Oh my god.

238
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,400
Anyway, what was I gonna say?

239
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:40,780
Oh yes.

240
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:41,260
Anyway.

241
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,200
Uh.

242
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:45,700
So yes, I was part of this Minecraft Twitch Rivals.

243
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:53,900
Even after I got knocked off, apparently like day 5 with the finals of the Minecraft Twitch Rivals got intense.

244
00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:55,120
Uh.

245
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:58,860
So intense that the finals was Connect 4.

246
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,180
Hahaha.

247
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:03,830
Hahaha.

248
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:05,210
So.

249
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:07,770
So they try to end.

250
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:07,990
They try to end.

251
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:13,050
A $70,000 first place with Connect 4.

252
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:14,310
So...

253
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:23,390
And by the way, there was apparently a bug in the semifinals.

254
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:31,190
There was yeah, the Connect 4 that lasted two hours too, by the way, the Connect 4 lasted two fucking hours.

255
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:36,770
Because it was so it was so badly planned.

256
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,690
It was poorly planned.

257
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:40,190
It was poorly planned.

258
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:43,910
That like, it was like in a standoff.

259
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:47,890
They were in a standoff because they kept like skipping the turn, their own turn.

260
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:53,530
They would skip their own turn because they know if they do a turn, the other player would win.

261
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:58,670
So for two hours, they would both just skip their turn and not place a block.

262
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:06,390
And then so there was a huge like two hours of nothing.

263
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:13,730
And then both players were like, we're not gonna play the game.

264
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:17,430
Just split the first place prize to the both of us.

265
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:20,310
So in the end, like there was no first place.

266
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:24,650
They both like they held, I mean, I would do that too.

267
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:31,090
They held the entire tournament hostage to split the prize money between the two.

268
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:34,150
I mean, that is so fucking smart.

269
00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:39,210
It's like, it's like a win win for both of them.

270
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:41,810
They each like, I mean, $35,000.

271
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:44,390
It's still a lot of money.

272
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:50,650
Yeah, $35,000.

273
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:53,410
It's still a lot of money.

274
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:57,130
So the fact that they managed to like hold the prize money.

275
00:14:57,150 --> 00:15:02,890
Hold the tournament hostage and like convince them to give them both $35,000.

276
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:05,230
That is so fucking smart.

277
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:09,390
That is actually so smart.

278
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:12,630
But yeah, no.

279
00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:26,110
And also like there was a huge bug in the semi-finals where there was like it ended up pitting like Spanish speaking Minecrafters against English speaking Minecrafters.

280
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:27,030
Because like.

281
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:33,970
There was a huge argument in the semi-finals because one of the English speaking Minecraft players got eliminated due to a bug.

282
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:40,170
So like the only Spanish speaking Minecraft player left in the entire tournament got through.

283
00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:53,550
So then like, so then all the Minecraft players started fighting about it because the English speaking Minecraft player was like, no, I deserve to have a rerun because I deserve to have a rerun because I clearly was a bug.

284
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:55,410
But then the admins was like, it's not a bug.

285
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:56,250
It was ping.

286
00:15:56,250 --> 00:16:01,510
And so then like there was a huge argument and they're like, I demand a, I demand a rematch.

287
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:05,930
And then, and then the admins ignored them and went straight into the finals.

288
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:11,910
And then the guy kept, it was so, oh my God, I wish you guys could have seen the discord.

289
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:13,650
It was actually insane.

290
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:17,210
It was so bad.

291
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:24,710
And then, um, um, the biggest Minecraft player that was still in the final day.

292
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:26,010
That was the biggest Minecraft player that was still in the final day.

293
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:28,010
Not the finals, but the last 20 players.

294
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:30,970
There was one really big Minecraft player.

295
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:35,210
I won't say names, but you guys can imply you were watching the four day event.

296
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:51,170
You guys, uh, can like, we'll be able to imply on who it was, but the biggest Minecraft player that was still in the last day who were like the top 20 got eliminated or like not eliminated, but there was a chance for them to like get eliminated.

297
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:55,990
And then it was so funny because Dream was watching his game.

298
00:16:57,010 --> 00:16:57,510
And then it was so funny because Dream was watching his game.

299
00:16:57,510 --> 00:17:00,630
Cause like they were part of the dream SMP.

300
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:05,970
And so, so like, he was like, it was funny.

301
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:07,230
It was so funny.

302
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:13,650
So he was like complaining about it and was like, this was the final day, by the way, he was complaining about it.

303
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:18,630
And he was like, and a dream was like, invite me to the server.

304
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:20,470
And then he was like, oh my God.

305
00:17:20,590 --> 00:17:25,970
And I was just, all I could think about was like, like Dream was like, invite me to the server.

306
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:28,730
Dream is like, invite me to the server.

307
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:30,930
So I can fight your fight.

308
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:34,930
This is what I thought, obviously they didn't say that.

309
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:37,250
But in my, cause I was watching the stream.

310
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:39,710
Cause I wanted to know what the was going on.

311
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:43,230
I was just like, oh my God, I want to know what his reaction is.

312
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:45,450
But like Dream was just like, put me in.

313
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:49,750
And then the guy was like, oh my God, I'm going to try and get stream into the server.

314
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:52,170
I must get dreaming server and give his opinion.

315
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:55,490
Like I was just like, bro, he's like calling his mom.

316
00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:57,450
I'm not a mom to fight his fight for it.

317
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:01,230
Dad, he's coming for you, kiddin'.

318
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:06,870
I got it.

319
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:07,970
It was so funny.

320
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:09,990
I was watching the fucking...

321
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:13,190
I was watching his stream and I'm like, really?

322
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:15,630
You're gonna try and get Dream involved?

323
00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:17,190
Like, what?

324
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:21,150
Dream, the man with a million controversies.

325
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:25,530
Like, his only weapon is his fanbase at that point.

326
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:32,190
I'll talk to my father about this.

327
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:41,110
I'm just like, holy fuck.

328
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:45,150
Like, that's so... it was so fu... I don't know.

329
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:46,750
I thought that shit was hilarious.

330
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:48,730
I was like, really?

331
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:50,730
You're really gonna try and get Dream involved?

332
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:55,410
Oh my god.

333
00:18:56,950 --> 00:18:59,290
Yeah, these are grown men, by the way.

334
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:00,150
These are...

335
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:08,690
I just think Minecraft... I think the Minecraft drama is so fucking funny.

336
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:13,550
There's so... oh my god.

337
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:17,430
There's someone that's like an outsider looking in.

338
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:20,270
It is... it's pretty funny.

339
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:25,430
Oh, shit.

340
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:29,370
Bro, Batman's a fucking millionaire!

341
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:35,370
Bro, 70k to that... to like some of the... I don't know if you guys know this.

342
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:39,830
But a lot of the bigger Minecraft streamers are millionaires.

343
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:41,030
100%.

344
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:42,410
Like, there's no way.

345
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:48,790
They have... they're like 5 million plus subscribers accounts.

346
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:50,150
Like, they're millionaires.

347
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:55,590
They have like... they have merchandise and Walmart, guys.

348
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:57,990
They're Minecrafters.

349
00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:00,410
They literally have Minecraft kids money.

350
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:01,770
Um...

351
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:07,610
So like... so like, they don't... they don't... he doesn't need the 70k.

352
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:08,990
It's just ego.

353
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:13,650
Like, a lot of the Minecraft players is just regarding the ego.

354
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:16,210
Um... the famous ones, obviously.

355
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:17,950
The famous Minecraft streamers.

356
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:22,830
There's... cause there's a lot of them that are like... not like 5 million plus Minecraft streamers.

357
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:26,310
But... Minecraft kids money is wild.

358
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:27,150
It's true.

359
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:28,310
It is wild.

360
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:30,830
Um...

361
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:33,710
Yeah, it's like not... it's actually insane.

362
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:39,030
So... so like, yeah.

363
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:40,430
It's actually crazy.

364
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:42,990
Just like watching the drama in the sideline.

365
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:45,390
Just seeing like the fights and stuff.

366
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:47,710
Gumi's not... Gumi doesn't even stream Minecraft.

367
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:48,310
Primarily.

368
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:50,910
She's like... she's like Minecraft sideline.

369
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:53,050
I think that's the perfect way to describe it.

370
00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:53,730
Like the side...

371
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:56,110
Oh yeah, and then you got all the... it was so weird.

372
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:59,770
Cause they're always like... they hate... a lot of them hate the games.

373
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:01,310
Because there's RNG involved.

374
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:04,070
Um... and like...

375
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:05,730
Okay, it's like funny too.

376
00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:06,770
Because they're like...

377
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:07,450
Oh my god.

378
00:21:07,530 --> 00:21:09,670
These games have so much RNG in it.

379
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:13,370
So that random Vtuber number 13 can like have a chance.

380
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:16,330
And I was like in the call when they said that.

381
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:17,790
And I was just like bro what?

382
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:18,890
That's me.

383
00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:20,590
I made it this far.

384
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:22,130
Because of RNG.

385
00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:24,890
And also Gumi dragging me through this.

386
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:25,230
But...

387
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:26,350
Four!

388
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:36,680
You can't fucking...

389
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,600
Bitch about RNG.

390
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:42,460
When the fucking finals is Connect Four.

391
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:44,380
Letting go.

392
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:51,800
And the funniest shit was that before the huge two hour delay.

393
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:54,240
The two hour hostage situation.

394
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:57,740
All the Minecrafters were complimenting the last game.

395
00:21:57,980 --> 00:21:59,560
It was fucking hilarious.

396
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:02,560
They were all complimenting the last game.

397
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:03,960
Until...

398
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:06,880
Until there was a bug that showed up.

399
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:09,120
And then everybody turned around.

400
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:10,860
And was like this game is shit.

401
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:12,400
This game is garbage.

402
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:13,980
There's so many bugs.

403
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:15,600
But then like...

404
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,600
They played two games of the Connect Four.

405
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:20,480
And everybody loved it.

406
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:24,220
And then the hostage situation came.

407
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:25,220
And they were like...

408
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:27,440
Bro this fucking RNG bullshit.

409
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:28,960
And I was just like...

410
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:29,860
Bro what the fuck?

411
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:31,460
Make up your mind.

412
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,180
I was just like...

413
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:37,940
Bro...

414
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:39,320
Make up...

415
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:41,220
Is it a good game mode?

416
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,180
Or a bad game mode?

417
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:45,300
Like what is it guys?

418
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:46,700
I can't tell.

419
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:49,960
You guys are having a huge mood swings right now.

420
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:50,880
I can't tell.

421
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,400
The switch...

422
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,240
No the thing is...

423
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,700
It's like everybody too.

424
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:56,680
Everybody was like...

425
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,260
This is a great game.

426
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:00,880
And then suddenly this huge bug happened.

427
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:02,840
That eliminated a player.

428
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:04,180
Because of it.

429
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,660
And then everybody turned around.

430
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:06,740
It was crazy.

431
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:07,660
It was...

432
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,820
And it was just me watching it too.

433
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,240
Cause like I didn't have...

434
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,220
It was like my rest day.

435
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:14,820
Because I don't have to stream day five.

436
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:16,120
I got eliminated on day four.

437
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:19,620
So I was just watching all the drama unfold on Discord.

438
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:22,040
And just seeing like everybody typing like...

439
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:22,880
Like they were like...

440
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,880
Everybody was like...

441
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:28,560
It was like they put the Discord on slow mode.

442
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:31,040
Like throughout the tournament.

443
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:34,140
Because everybody was just...

444
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:35,880
It was like several people typing like...

445
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:43,540
The Discord server was like on slow mode.

446
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:44,680
It was on a...

447
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:49,620
It was on a one minute timer cooldown per message.

448
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:53,880
And then it was like...

449
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,360
I was just like holy shit.

450
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:57,040
People are angry.

451
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,040
People are so angry.

452
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:03,440
Doug, thank you for the super chat.

453
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:03,800
Thank you.

454
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:08,740
On one hand, I'm sad you didn't get anything from the event.

455
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:12,520
On the other, we got to see the most chaotic neutral internet discussion I've seen.

456
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,260
Thank you.

457
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:14,580
Overconnect?

458
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:15,420
Boy.

459
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:19,560
Thank you for the super chat.

460
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:20,220
Thank you.

461
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:20,880
Thank you.

462
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:21,880
Stranger.

463
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:22,740
Thank you the super chat.

464
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:23,080
Thank you.

465
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:23,520
Thank you.

466
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:24,920
RngCottack4?

467
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:25,980
My brother in Christ.

468
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:27,040
You control the fort.

469
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,600
Thank you for the super chat.

470
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:29,140
Thank you.

471
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:29,760
Thank you.

472
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:30,380
Stranger.

473
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:31,400
Oh...

474
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:33,900
Yeah...

475
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:34,160
It's.

476
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,020
It's so...

477
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:37,140
It's actually insane.

478
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,580
Oh, my God.

479
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:43,820
Oh...

480
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:44,260
Anyway.

481
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:45,140
I mean.

482
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,620
I have a lot of other life updates.

483
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,840
But just wanted to update you guys regarding.

484
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:50,180
Regarding.

485
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:50,860
Why I have...

486
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:54,740
This is why I've been gone where I was the past week for those who are mostly on YouTube.

487
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:57,740
This was why I was gone the past week.

488
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:02,340
Because instead of rest week, we had Twitch week!

489
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:03,020
Yeah!

490
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:14,040
We somehow managed to get into Twitch week instead of rest week.

491
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,740
So yeah, anyway!

492
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:23,120
Alright, for those who left for 20 minutes because they wanted to watch me play the video game, it's time to tap back in.

493
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:26,260
It's time for Indigo Park, guys!

494
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:31,700
So, Indigo Park is the new flavor of the month mascot horror game.

495
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:33,360
What is that, you may ask?

496
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:37,600
Well, every couple of months, there is always a new mascot horror game.

497
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:43,320
Because FNAF started... brought in the fad.

498
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:45,180
So, mascot horror games!

499
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:48,020
The most famous one is FNAF!

500
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,260
Five Nights at Freddy's!

501
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:51,540
Then we have Poppy's Playtime!

502
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:55,060
Then we have the monstrosity Garden of Bon Bon!

503
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:56,840
Okay!

504
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:58,280
I'm gonna say it.

505
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:01,320
Garden of Bon Bon has to be the most...

506
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:02,820
Has to be like...

507
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:06,680
I don't know how the fuck that got popular.

508
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:07,780
Like...

509
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:10,860
I'm gonna say it.

510
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,060
That game...

511
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:15,320
80% of that game has to be like...

512
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:16,320
Acid Flips.

513
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:17,000
Like I...

514
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:21,220
Like the fucking mascot themselves!

515
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:22,880
Like...

516
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,020
Oh my god!

517
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:27,020
The mascot themselves is...

518
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:33,100
It's so bad that it's true!

519
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:37,060
It's so bad that it's good!

520
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:42,660
Is it supposed...

521
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:45,180
I'm pretty sure it's not supposed to be a parody chat!

522
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:47,680
Like... did you not...

523
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:51,940
I'm pretty sure it's not supposed to be a parody!

524
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,080
Yes!

525
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,840
What are you talking about?

526
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,080
Oh my god!

527
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:02,000
Okay, anyway...

528
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:04,740
Yeah, you guys didn't know.

529
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,240
Yes, the person who's right.

530
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:09,080
The Bon Bon models are famously so high poly...

531
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:11,600
And trying to load the model will break your computer.

532
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:12,080
Yes!

533
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:16,280
The reason why the Garden of Bon Bon is so poorly optimized...

534
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:18,080
Is because...

535
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,540
The models for the Bon Bon models...

536
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:21,340
Are like...

537
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:24,240
A thousand plus polygons or some shit.

538
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:26,340
Like, I don't know, 30,000 polygons.

539
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:27,920
It's actually...

540
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,100
It's actually insane.

541
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,240
But anyway, like I said...

542
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:35,600
It's all about the mascot horror genre.

543
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:38,260
So now we have Garden of Bon Bon...

544
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:39,560
Poppy's Playtime...

545
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:40,640
FNAF...

546
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,560
Benny and the Ink Machine...

547
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:45,840
They're all in!

548
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:46,700
The whole...

549
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:49,780
Every couple of months, we always get a new...

550
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:51,300
Mascot horror game.

551
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,800
Because that's what kids love, baby!

552
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:54,720
Wooo!

553
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:57,060
Scam those children!

554
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:59,340
And have some...

555
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:01,840
Really complicated, over convoluted...

556
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:02,080
Lore!

557
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:05,440
So that horror channels will do like...

558
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:05,720
Oh!

559
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:08,900
Let me do some predictions about it!

560
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:15,540
Oh yeah!

561
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:15,860
Oh yeah!

562
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:17,020
Then the Amanda too!

563
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,180
Hello neighbor!

564
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:21,700
Grab those children and get them invested on the...

565
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,000
Over convoluted lore!

566
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:30,100
Because that's what the children love!

567
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:31,640
Anyway...

568
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:32,880
Of course...

569
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:34,680
I am a content creator.

570
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:37,000
The Endless Theories.

571
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:38,740
Yes, the Endless Theories.

572
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:41,340
And they get a retcon and everything.

573
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:42,980
And they...

574
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:47,280
Anyway...

575
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:49,280
So as a content creator...

576
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,460
I like money.

577
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,720
So I also...

578
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:58,080
Fall into the system...

579
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,820
Of playing the mascot horror drama.

580
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:04,390
Of playing the mascot horror drama.

581
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:07,990
So here we are...

582
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:10,630
Testing, trying out the new...

583
00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:10,890
So here we are...

584
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:13,750
The Slayver of the month mascot horror game.

585
00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:16,350
Apparently it is actually pretty decent.

586
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:17,810
Apparently it is actually pretty decent.

587
00:29:17,810 --> 00:29:19,910
The matter of slavery...

588
00:29:19,910 --> 00:29:21,970
That's understandable.

589
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:25,530
Thank you capitalism.

590
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:26,810
But yes...

591
00:29:26,810 --> 00:29:27,690
So...

592
00:29:27,690 --> 00:29:30,750
People are saying it's sort of like a...

593
00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:31,990
Walking simulator.

594
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:35,070
Versus an actual horror game.

595
00:29:35,390 --> 00:29:36,210
So like...

596
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:37,650
We'll see what it is guys.

597
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:38,490
So...

598
00:29:38,490 --> 00:29:39,730
So we'll see.

599
00:29:39,810 --> 00:29:41,250
We'll see how it feels.

600
00:29:41,390 --> 00:29:42,390
I've never played this before.

601
00:29:43,690 --> 00:29:44,890
Okay I'm gonna like...

602
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:46,830
Give you guys straight why I never touch...

603
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:48,190
I will never touch Poppy's Playtime.

604
00:29:48,410 --> 00:29:49,430
I'm gonna tell you guys right now.

605
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:51,210
I'll never touch Poppy's Playtime.

606
00:29:51,470 --> 00:29:55,510
Because of one incident that happened in Poppy's Playtime.

607
00:29:57,270 --> 00:29:57,790
And...

608
00:29:58,370 --> 00:29:59,610
Very early on.

609
00:29:59,690 --> 00:30:01,010
But the internet forgets.

610
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:04,590
So like after that incident that happened with Poppy's Playtime.

611
00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:06,890
I will never touch Poppy's Playtime.

612
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:10,210
It was...

613
00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:11,270
That's why I never...

614
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:12,470
Never played it before.

615
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:13,670
I've never played it before.

616
00:30:13,930 --> 00:30:15,330
And I'll never play it.

617
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:17,710
No it wasn't the NFT incident.

618
00:30:17,870 --> 00:30:18,750
It was something else.

619
00:30:18,810 --> 00:30:20,670
It was regarding like the develop...

620
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:22,390
I don't really like the devs of...

621
00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:26,510
I don't really like the devs of Poppy's Playtime.

622
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:29,750
And there was like a huge incident that happened.

623
00:30:29,990 --> 00:30:31,290
Between the devs.

624
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:33,370
And that's why I would never...

625
00:30:33,370 --> 00:30:34,570
That's why I've never even played Poppy's Playtime.

626
00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:35,150
I've never played it...

627
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:36,830
Before then.

628
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:37,910
Before as Doki.

629
00:30:38,210 --> 00:30:39,690
I've never played it before then.

630
00:30:39,790 --> 00:30:40,630
But I'll let you guys know now.

631
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:43,910
The reason why I'll never touch Poppy's Playtime.

632
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:46,290
I don't care about the other mascot horror genres.

633
00:30:48,330 --> 00:30:49,090
But yeah.

634
00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:50,150
That was the reason why.

635
00:30:52,270 --> 00:30:54,790
It was like a long time ago too.

636
00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:56,390
This happened like a long time ago.

637
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:00,150
And that's why I'll never touch it.

638
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:00,650
Anyway.

639
00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:03,410
Let's play Indigo Park.

640
00:31:03,910 --> 00:31:04,430
Indigo Park.

641
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:05,990
I loved...

642
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:10,230
It was so funny because I was listening to the music of it.

643
00:31:10,430 --> 00:31:12,410
And like it's so happy.

644
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:13,290
Like what?

645
00:31:13,710 --> 00:31:14,590
Oh yeah.

646
00:31:14,670 --> 00:31:15,990
That's why it's called Raccoon.

647
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:19,710
Alright.

648
00:31:20,290 --> 00:31:20,930
Yay!

649
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:23,830
Such happy music!

650
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:27,150
Yay!

651
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:29,670
If you guys didn't know.

652
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:32,070
The Poppy's Playtime dev used to do like...

653
00:31:32,530 --> 00:31:33,390
FNAF animations.

654
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:36,110
So like they were...

655
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:37,570
It was crazy.

656
00:31:41,270 --> 00:31:42,390
Before like...

657
00:31:42,390 --> 00:31:44,710
Before they made Poppy's Playtime.

658
00:31:44,810 --> 00:31:46,390
They would do like FNAF music videos.

659
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:51,780
Hey!

660
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:54,840
Ahhhh.

661
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:56,740
Let's see.

662
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:58,960
Loonimo.

663
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:00,140
Thank you for the super chat.

664
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:00,460
Thank you.

665
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:03,080
What influenced you into playing this game?

666
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:04,560
Rana has been recommended a lot.

667
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:05,600
Doki, I like money.

668
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:06,760
I almost spilled my water.

669
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:08,340
Thank you for the super chat.

670
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:08,720
Thank you.

671
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:10,100
Hey Tengen.

672
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:12,420
I wish I could enjoy it.

673
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:14,560
Oh apparently this isn't really a horror game Tengen.

674
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:17,060
It's more so of a horse walking simulator.

675
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:18,580
With like...

676
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:20,620
So like I don't know.

677
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:22,340
That's what I've heard about it.

678
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:23,460
Um...

679
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:25,440
But yeah let's go.

680
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:26,460
New game!

681
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,060
Are you sure you want to start a new game?

682
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:29,580
Yes I've never played this game before.

683
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:30,780
We played FNAF.

684
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:33,620
I actually played FNAF and I beat it world record.

685
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:35,680
I had a world record on FNAF.

686
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:48,440
But I couldn't upload it on the speedrun thing because it's like heavily it's so really programmed that you have to press new game instead of uh instead of like continue game.

687
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:51,320
So I couldn't get a put it on the world record.

688
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:00,700
Is this Walt Disney?

689
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:03,560
But like copyright free Walt Disney?

690
00:33:12,650 --> 00:33:13,410
Is that me?

691
00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:17,030
Oh my god that's my gamer table!

692
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:20,050
With my one can of World Up.

693
00:33:23,130 --> 00:33:23,910
Don't miss me!

694
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:27,270
Mom's favorite.

695
00:33:27,530 --> 00:33:28,650
Molly McCaws.

696
00:33:29,010 --> 00:33:30,890
Hey Laura I'm doing another search this week.

697
00:33:30,990 --> 00:33:31,930
Do you want to come with me?

698
00:33:32,170 --> 00:33:32,970
What is it?

699
00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:34,330
The last time I got with you I sucked.

700
00:33:34,570 --> 00:33:42,830
Remember the old... Oh they're like those like um those people like in that MrBeast video where they explored an abandoned island.

701
00:33:45,430 --> 00:33:49,870
They're like those uh Oh it's called Bird Up.

702
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:52,830
They're like those content creators that explore abandoned places.

703
00:33:53,490 --> 00:34:02,490
There's like one channel that does like exploring abandoned places and they were doing... I saw one of them where they visit like abandoned hospital.

704
00:34:03,970 --> 00:34:05,670
Oh my god that's a YouTube figure.

705
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:10,130
By the way guys my YouTube figures are coming out like tomorrow for pre-order.

706
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:14,830
Is it Urban Explorers?

707
00:34:14,850 --> 00:34:19,070
There was one I was watching that was like where they were exploring the abandoned hospital.

708
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:20,890
It was so fucking freaky.

709
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:30,020
Okay I think it's fucking stupid that a hospital can be abandoned.

710
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:34,660
Because like I've seen how expensive hospitals are.

711
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:37,160
Like hospital equipment are.

712
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:41,420
So the fact that like a hospital can be abandoned.

713
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:45,440
I'm like that's where our taxpayer money is going to.

714
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:52,340
Like that shit is expensive.

715
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:55,700
There's like an abandoned like MRI scanner.

716
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:56,620
Like what?

717
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:58,520
That's like at least a million dollars.

718
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:05,300
I'm just like this is so fucking unfair.

719
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,480
This is unfair.

720
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:14,600
Oh my god.

721
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:15,440
Oh my god.

722
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,620
Oh I hope it better be a private hospital.

723
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:22,200
This better not be a public hospital.

724
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:29,600
Because medical equipment is so expensive.

725
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:31,840
Okay.

726
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,020
Apply changes.

727
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,160
Alright I need to make sure.

728
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:37,800
Well okay the sensitivity is so fucking...

729
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:39,100
Uh hi.

730
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:39,980
Alright.

731
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:47,320
I would be so mad if it was a public hospital.

732
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:48,260
I would be so mad if it was a public hospital.

733
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:49,300
Is sound guy here?

734
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:50,360
Is sound guy here?

735
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:51,160
Sound guy are you on?

736
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:53,580
If not I'm gonna like.

737
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:54,800
If sound guy's not here.

738
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:58,500
I'm gonna pawn off your sound guy job to the other mine.

739
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:00,480
To the regular mine.

740
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:03,300
Even though they have like no license to sound guy.

741
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:05,780
Oh sound guy!

742
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:06,200
Alright.

743
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:06,900
Sound guy.

744
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:08,080
Oh my god there's a lion.

745
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:09,280
Can I pick it up?

746
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:10,460
Nice.

747
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,300
Oh information kiosk.

748
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,300
Sound guy's here.

749
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:20,120
Alright I know like it's not... you're not...

750
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:22,280
You don't have the degree to do the sound guy.

751
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:22,560
Woah!

752
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:25,220
But that's okay.

753
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:27,800
We're a company now.

754
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:30,780
Toe Keeper.

755
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:31,220
Woah!

756
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:34,140
Toe Keeper Incorporated.

757
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:37,580
We're not actually a company by the way.

758
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:38,200
I'm just me.

759
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:39,060
Sound guy.

760
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:45,380
You're our first guest in 2,920 days, 4 hours, 23 minutes, and 38 seconds.

761
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:46,220
Congratulations!

762
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:47,320
Yay!

763
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:50,080
Hello Rambly the raccoon.

764
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:53,800
It's my job to make sure your experience here at Indigo Park is the most rewarding.

765
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:57,140
Just hop on over to the registration center to your left.

766
00:36:57,260 --> 00:37:00,360
Where our friendly assistant will help you begin your adventure in the park.

767
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:01,700
Wait who's my assistant?

768
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:05,560
Press E to interact with an object while looking?

769
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:06,860
Okay.

770
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,440
What do I do?

771
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:09,700
I'm gonna interact with a chair?

772
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:10,660
Hi!

773
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:11,700
I'm Rambly.

774
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:12,700
Rambly the raccoon.

775
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:16,440
And it's my job to make sure your experience here at Indigo Park is registered.

776
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:19,360
Let me just get a good look at you.

777
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:21,360
We have to register by PC?

778
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,780
You seem to have your face in our guest list.

779
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,080
Is this your first time here at the park?

780
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:28,340
Or did you just get plastic surgery?

781
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:29,560
No worries.

782
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,060
It's Rambly Tuesday.

783
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:34,120
So you qualify for a big discount on your visit.

784
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,880
Just follow me to the main gate.

785
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,000
I got a discount?

786
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:40,160
I got a discount on everything Indigo Park has to offer.

787
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:41,740
Oh my God!

788
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:48,380
Wait how come the monitors look real- this- okay.

789
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:49,120
Alright.

790
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:50,660
This is a little bit nitpicky.

791
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:55,560
This is a little nitpicky.

792
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:58,200
This is an old ass telephone.

793
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:01,560
But this monitor is not an old ass monitor.

794
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:10,760
If you're gonna acid flip at least make it- I'm joking.

795
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,860
I don't know if they're actually acid flipping.

796
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:13,700
I don't know.

797
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:18,160
I don't know if this is like a- They bought some acids on the Unity store.

798
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:24,720
I won't judge.

799
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:26,780
I was just joking.

800
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:28,320
It was not actually judging.

801
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:29,360
Ooh.

802
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,180
I wonder why this- It is?

803
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:35,840
Oh!

804
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:37,320
Is this the gate?

805
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:40,840
Yeah, it's not open.

806
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:46,220
Yeah, it's the error message.

807
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:51,760
Yeah, it's the error message.

808
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:52,640
Me?

809
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:54,680
Oh my God.

810
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:58,140
Oh, I'll bring down the music?

811
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:03,180
I'd love to show you the audio cause it's just one.

812
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,600
What music audio?

813
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:15,440
What music audio?

814
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:16,360
Okay.

815
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:21,360
It's literally just one audio volume.

816
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:24,500
Only the master volume.

817
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:30,860
Okay, hold shift while- Yay, I can run.

818
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:31,540
Do I have stamina?

819
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:33,300
No, I don't.

820
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:35,320
Guys, I don't have stamina.

821
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:39,320
Guys, I'm built like a fucking god.

822
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:49,540
It is?

823
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:52,320
Is it this piece?

824
00:39:56,490 --> 00:39:57,290
Oh.

825
00:39:57,390 --> 00:39:58,370
Where's the piece?

826
00:39:58,830 --> 00:40:00,350
Oh, there's a collectible.

827
00:40:03,430 --> 00:40:05,090
Brambley, where is it?

828
00:40:06,810 --> 00:40:07,330
Brambley!

829
00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:10,290
Oh no.

830
00:40:10,390 --> 00:40:10,810
Oh, there it is.

831
00:40:10,810 --> 00:40:11,130
It's right here.

832
00:40:11,390 --> 00:40:11,890
Okay.

833
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:12,510
Nice.

834
00:40:12,830 --> 00:40:13,930
I found it.

835
00:40:17,490 --> 00:40:18,010
Yay!

836
00:40:18,170 --> 00:40:19,310
Am I a child?

837
00:40:19,410 --> 00:40:20,690
Look at my child hands.

838
00:40:22,650 --> 00:40:24,110
A children hands.

839
00:40:25,710 --> 00:40:26,230
Okay.

840
00:40:26,310 --> 00:40:27,490
I turned on the generator.

841
00:40:27,950 --> 00:40:28,470
Brambley.

842
00:40:31,290 --> 00:40:32,770
Can I go inside now?

843
00:40:33,450 --> 00:40:34,770
Inside the theme park?

844
00:40:35,510 --> 00:40:35,950
Okay.

845
00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:37,190
For real this time.

846
00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:38,070
Yay!

847
00:40:40,910 --> 00:40:41,350
Alright.

848
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:42,850
Seems fun.

849
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,420
Yeah, thank you for the super chat.

850
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:50,180
Thank you, thank you.

851
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:53,740
But Doki, if there's infinite stamina, that means you're gonna be running a lot.

852
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:54,640
Thank you for the super chat.

853
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:55,300
Thank you, thank you.

854
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:58,400
No, that means I won't be running a lot.

855
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:02,580
Because infinite stamina is here to freak you out when you're getting chased.

856
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:04,820
So you would manage your stamina.

857
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:09,200
That's why I feel safer now.

858
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:15,040
Because when you don't have infinite stamina, then you know you're gonna get chased.

859
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:18,300
Then you know you have to manage it.

860
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:19,140
Then you know you have to manage it.

861
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:19,720
Then you know you have to manage it.

862
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:22,640
I know how horror games work.

863
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:23,680
I know how horror games work.

864
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:24,300
I know how horror games work.

865
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:25,940
Oh, Brambley.

866
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:27,840
Every guest needs a critter cuff.

867
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:34,000
That will allow you access to reserved areas, charge payments to your room, and get a free gift shop.

868
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,240
A critter cuff?

869
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,640
Head in there and I'll get you set up.

870
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:38,340
Okay.

871
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:41,300
Please have your critter cuff ready to scan.

872
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:46,280
How is he able to have power working when the generator's not on?

873
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:49,940
Where's the critter- Oh, there it is!

874
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:50,420
The gift shop!

875
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:53,380
Oh my god, look at all those marketable plushies!

876
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:56,220
There's the off-brand Mickey.

877
00:41:56,740 --> 00:41:58,900
I assume that's the off-brand Goofy.

878
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:00,820
Off-brand Donald.

879
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:02,560
And then...

880
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:03,440
Dragon.

881
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:06,160
I don't know, Pete?

882
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:11,060
Oh, there you are.

883
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:23,160
Oh, where is it?

884
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:23,880
Oh, there it is!

885
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:28,500
I mean, it's pretty sus that he's able to get the TV working.

886
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:30,300
Um...

887
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:32,520
Oh my god, my fast pass is here.

888
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:34,980
TV working when the generator wasn't on already.

889
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:37,200
Has he always been looking at me?

890
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:37,340
Oh!

891
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:39,840
The door mysteriously locked!

892
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:42,880
Why not test out your band and save the day?

893
00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:44,060
Alright.

894
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:46,620
You know you can buy that shirt right now.

895
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:49,640
I think this is why mascot horror games are so popular.

896
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:51,820
Because the merchandising goes fucking crazy.

897
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:55,440
Because the merchandising goes fucking crazy.

898
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:55,820
Boop.

899
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:00,540
Hooray!

900
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:01,520
Great work buddy!

901
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:03,740
Wait, I'm gonna get my own mascot horror game.

902
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:06,180
And then you can find me on Hot Topic.

903
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:08,440
Or like, what's the other version?

904
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:10,600
There was another, the other Hot Topic store.

905
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:13,660
The other edgier Hot Topic store.

906
00:43:14,140 --> 00:43:14,880
The other edgier Hot Topic store.

907
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:17,120
I wanna be a mascot horror game.

908
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:19,540
And be on fucking Hot Topic.

909
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:20,000
And be on fucking Hot Topic.

910
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
For all the pre-teens and children.

911
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:22,680
For all the pre-teens and children.

912
00:43:23,580 --> 00:43:24,460
Spencers, yes!

913
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:28,800
Guys, make me so popular that you'll find me at a Spencer.

914
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:35,640
My new goal is to be in a Spencer store.

915
00:43:40,460 --> 00:43:41,500
Doki, no!

916
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:45,440
That is my new goal.

917
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:47,860
You know, I was like, I don't really have any goals anymore.

918
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:49,360
Except for getting a million subscribers.

919
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:51,320
My second goal!

920
00:43:51,860 --> 00:43:53,720
I wanna be a mascot horror game.

921
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:54,440
I wanna be a mascot horror game.

922
00:43:55,140 --> 00:43:57,520
I wanna have merchandise in Spencers.

923
00:44:04,620 --> 00:44:06,920
This is why we needed Funko Pop.

924
00:44:07,180 --> 00:44:09,560
Cause Funko Pops are always in a Spencer store.

925
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:12,140
That's a unique goal.

926
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:16,320
You know, if I'm in a Spencer...

927
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:17,340
Pretzel dog.

928
00:44:17,620 --> 00:44:21,300
If I'm in a Spencer's, then you know I've made it, guys.

929
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:24,440
You know I'm a millionaire if I made it into a Spencers store.

930
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:25,460
Spencers.

931
00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:29,220
You can call me a millionaire if you see me at a Spencers.

932
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:29,740
Like...

933
00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:32,400
In the front...

934
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:33,960
Oh my god, of course the front of the...

935
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:37,220
Never go to the back of the Spencer store, guys.

936
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:38,920
Jonathan, thank you for the super chat.

937
00:44:39,020 --> 00:44:39,340
Thank you.

938
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:43,600
Don't go to the back of the Spencer store.

939
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:44,660
I went to the back...

940
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:47,440
I went to the back of the Spencer.

941
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:47,780
What?

942
00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:48,740
There's a loading screen?

943
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:53,320
What the fuck?

944
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:54,580
What the fuck happened?

945
00:44:54,580 --> 00:44:56,600
What the... When did this happen?

946
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:01,680
I loaded screen into a collapse?

947
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:04,320
I loaded screen into a collapse?

948
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:04,380
Okay.

949
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:05,420
Alright.

950
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:07,640
Yay!

951
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:08,840
Whoa.

952
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:09,660
Ooh.

953
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:11,140
The bathroom's creepy.

954
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:14,160
Ooh, I don't like it.

955
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:17,040
The sky fell.

956
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:18,800
Oh my god.

957
00:45:18,860 --> 00:45:20,240
Time to use all my...

958
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:21,320
I can't use the bathroom?

959
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:23,580
9 out of 10.

960
00:45:24,580 --> 00:45:26,020
I need to use the bathroom.

961
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:30,760
Somehow the ceiling collapsed.

962
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:33,800
Yeah, somehow the ceiling collapsed in the middle...

963
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:36,520
in the middle of my Spencer's rant.

964
00:45:36,820 --> 00:45:37,720
Alright, women's bathroom.

965
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:38,400
Knock knock!

966
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:40,180
I think my character's a man.

967
00:45:41,420 --> 00:45:42,140
Oh hey.

968
00:45:42,460 --> 00:45:43,320
Oh my god!

969
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:44,160
There's my Funko Pop!

970
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:45,980
I'm sorry.

971
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:46,860
My YouTube's pop.

972
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:49,140
My YouTube's figure.

973
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:52,600
Ooh.

974
00:45:54,580 --> 00:45:56,400
Look how it's like really quiet now.

975
00:45:57,220 --> 00:45:58,140
Pardon our dust, buddy.

976
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:00,660
Looks like the park is going through some...

977
00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:01,320
Wait.

978
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:02,360
It knows?

979
00:46:02,580 --> 00:46:03,000
It's an AI!

980
00:46:03,620 --> 00:46:05,880
Your Rambly Tuesday discount will be...

981
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:07,300
3% off!

982
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:10,400
Why not celebrate this great deal with a ride on my railroad?

983
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:14,540
To test your sleuthing skills, I'll let you find this one all by yourself.

984
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:15,960
Who the fuck is Molly?

985
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:21,740
Oh, this is Molly.

986
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:24,380
I mean, Molly seems like a nice gal.

987
00:46:25,860 --> 00:46:26,980
Oh, what the...

988
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:27,280
Ah, fuck!

989
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:29,280
I don't like that.

990
00:46:31,020 --> 00:46:32,560
Bro, I don't like that.

991
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:34,860
Ooh!

992
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:37,920
What happened to the happy music?

993
00:46:38,940 --> 00:46:39,380
What?

994
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:41,280
What's going on?

995
00:46:41,620 --> 00:46:43,320
Oh, is this AI taking over?

996
00:46:44,540 --> 00:46:44,980
Oh...

997
00:46:44,980 --> 00:46:47,320
I don't like how the AI is taking over.

998
00:46:47,980 --> 00:46:49,180
CamRage, thank you for the super chat.

999
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:49,500
Thank you.

1000
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:55,240
I look forward to the cardboard cutout of Doki Bird displayed at the front window of my local mall, Spencer's.

1001
00:46:55,260 --> 00:46:56,300
Thank you for the super chat.

1002
00:46:56,300 --> 00:46:56,600
Thank you.

1003
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:58,080
I mean, they already have...

1004
00:46:58,080 --> 00:46:59,220
Oh my gosh, I don't like this.

1005
00:46:59,380 --> 00:47:02,320
They already have like random anime t-shirts.

1006
00:47:03,180 --> 00:47:07,120
...suggests you may be a bit older than the target audience for this ride.

1007
00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:08,720
But it's one of my favorites.

1008
00:47:09,100 --> 00:47:13,300
Do you know why Rambly the raccoon loves Rambly's Railroad?

1009
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:14,000
Do you know why Rambly the raccoon loves Rambly's Railroad?

1010
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:15,320
Do you know why Rambly the raccoon loves Rambly's Railroad?

1011
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:16,020
Did you see that?

1012
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:17,240
There was a scary cut.

1013
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:20,840
What do you mean Molly is gonna chase me?

1014
00:47:21,140 --> 00:47:21,180
What do you mean Molly is gonna chase me?

1015
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:23,360
Molly's a nice bird.

1016
00:47:24,820 --> 00:47:26,340
She looks really nice.

1017
00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:28,020
I don't like this.

1018
00:47:30,460 --> 00:47:31,060
I don't like this.

1019
00:47:32,300 --> 00:47:32,900
Oh!

1020
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:38,240
I'm gonna walk really slow.

1021
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:39,400
I'm gonna walk really slow.

1022
00:47:39,580 --> 00:47:41,820
She would not do that to me.

1023
00:47:42,220 --> 00:47:42,820
She would not do that to me.

1024
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:46,400
Alright, but Spencer's already has like random anime t-shirts.

1025
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:47,620
Just bring in VTubers.

1026
00:47:48,020 --> 00:47:48,280
Just bring in VTubers.

1027
00:47:50,340 --> 00:47:51,620
Where are my VTubers?

1028
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:52,380
Where are my VTubers?

1029
00:47:58,210 --> 00:47:59,390
I like trains.

1030
00:48:01,250 --> 00:48:01,850
Yay!

1031
00:48:02,490 --> 00:48:03,290
Oh my gosh!

1032
00:48:03,550 --> 00:48:04,330
Hello, Rambly's Railroad!

1033
00:48:04,510 --> 00:48:06,150
I'm Conductor Rambly!

1034
00:48:06,170 --> 00:48:07,450
Hello, Conductor Rambly!

1035
00:48:08,610 --> 00:48:09,210
Whoa!

1036
00:48:09,550 --> 00:48:11,130
Goodbye, Conductor Rambly!

1037
00:48:11,590 --> 00:48:12,510
Oh my gosh!

1038
00:48:12,570 --> 00:48:13,790
It's like the Mickey Mouse ride!

1039
00:48:15,650 --> 00:48:16,450
Oh look!

1040
00:48:16,550 --> 00:48:17,470
It's Molly McCall!

1041
00:48:17,650 --> 00:48:18,110
Hey Molly!

1042
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:23,060
You sure are, Molly.

1043
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:25,980
Why, you only crashed into six bars this week.

1044
00:48:26,380 --> 00:48:27,680
I'm not crashing!

1045
00:48:31,820 --> 00:48:32,740
What's barnstorming?

1046
00:48:32,740 --> 00:48:34,240
Yeah, what's barnstorming?

1047
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:36,740
Oh god, that's me!

1048
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:39,260
Molly,

1049
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:43,980
no!

1050
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:44,860
There's the sun!

1051
00:48:45,020 --> 00:48:45,360
Molly!

1052
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:46,500
You're AirPodron!

1053
00:48:49,180 --> 00:48:50,300
Oh, goodbye, Molly.

1054
00:48:52,660 --> 00:48:53,360
Oh hey!

1055
00:48:53,540 --> 00:48:54,320
There's a beach!

1056
00:48:59,710 --> 00:49:01,030
Oh, I don't...

1057
00:49:03,630 --> 00:49:04,830
Oh my god, okay.

1058
00:49:05,110 --> 00:49:06,090
Okay, it's a dragon.

1059
00:49:06,270 --> 00:49:07,210
Okay, I didn't like the...

1060
00:49:07,210 --> 00:49:07,570
I didn't like the...

1061
00:49:07,590 --> 00:49:08,410
I didn't like the whole...

1062
00:49:08,410 --> 00:49:09,830
You've known me for one hundred

1063
00:49:15,420 --> 00:49:17,580
years for a new seashell from my collection.

1064
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:19,660
Oh, it's a sea dragon!

1065
00:49:19,820 --> 00:49:20,780
It's a Loch Ness!

1066
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:21,360
It's a Loch Ness!

1067
00:49:22,930 --> 00:49:23,820
It's friend-shaped!

1068
00:49:24,660 --> 00:49:25,500
Come into it instead.

1069
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:31,840
My ride, Oceanic Odyssey, will teach you all about the wonders down the ocean.

1070
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:35,100
Oh, they're introducing each special ride that the mascots have.

1071
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:38,120
I know, I thought it was Eeyore.

1072
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:38,420
I know, I thought it was Eeyore.

1073
00:49:38,420 --> 00:49:40,100
He seems like Eeyore.

1074
00:49:40,100 --> 00:49:41,820
I'm so lonely.

1075
00:49:42,340 --> 00:49:44,280
Oceanic Odyssey currently closed for repairs.

1076
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:45,940
Nooooo!

1077
00:49:54,690 --> 00:49:55,330
Oh...

1078
00:49:56,350 --> 00:49:57,670
What happened to...

1079
00:49:57,670 --> 00:49:59,270
Why did I get off?!

1080
00:50:00,430 --> 00:50:01,070
No!

1081
00:50:03,890 --> 00:50:05,150
Oh no!

1082
00:50:05,270 --> 00:50:06,430
I had goosebumps!

1083
00:50:06,630 --> 00:50:07,550
I have goosebumps!

1084
00:50:08,490 --> 00:50:09,130
Oh...

1085
00:50:09,770 --> 00:50:13,030
I did not consent to getting off the ride.

1086
00:50:14,010 --> 00:50:15,690
Oh, the door opened by itself!

1087
00:50:15,890 --> 00:50:16,370
I love that!

1088
00:50:16,530 --> 00:50:16,830
Oh, I'm so happy!

1089
00:50:16,850 --> 00:50:18,290
Don't you love it when the game...

1090
00:50:18,930 --> 00:50:19,490
Oh!

1091
00:50:21,150 --> 00:50:22,870
I have goosebumps right now!

1092
00:50:22,990 --> 00:50:23,690
Oh, I don't like this.

1093
00:50:23,830 --> 00:50:25,250
I actually have goosebumps right now.

1094
00:50:25,730 --> 00:50:26,290
Oh...

1095
00:50:26,810 --> 00:50:27,750
Oh hey, there's Molly!

1096
00:50:28,470 --> 00:50:29,710
She seems nice!

1097
00:50:33,410 --> 00:50:36,890
She seems nice and totally not gonna get back up.

1098
00:50:37,470 --> 00:50:38,030
Right?

1099
00:50:38,730 --> 00:50:39,570
Oh hey!

1100
00:50:39,730 --> 00:50:40,850
There's Lloyd!

1101
00:50:44,070 --> 00:50:45,710
Where would the gear be?

1102
00:50:47,050 --> 00:50:47,930
Oh, there it is.

1103
00:50:48,030 --> 00:50:48,750
In front of me.

1104
00:50:52,060 --> 00:50:53,900
Oh, there's two gears?!

1105
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:55,840
Oh my god!

1106
00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:56,740
This is bad!

1107
00:50:58,440 --> 00:50:59,360
I'm too stu...

1108
00:50:59,360 --> 00:50:59,880
Oh, there it is!

1109
00:51:01,140 --> 00:51:04,160
Oh, I don't like how I can hear rambly on the background.

1110
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:06,620
Makes me so uncomfortable.

1111
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:08,580
Hey Molly!

1112
00:51:08,740 --> 00:51:11,180
Are you gonna be getting up now and chasing me?

1113
00:51:12,740 --> 00:51:14,000
Molly, are you okay?

1114
00:51:15,580 --> 00:51:16,460
Goodbye Molly!

1115
00:51:17,380 --> 00:51:18,200
Oh, look at that!

1116
00:51:18,220 --> 00:51:18,360
Oh, goodbye!

1117
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:21,020
What happens if I die?

1118
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:23,560
Like, do I have to redo the entire thing?

1119
00:51:24,460 --> 00:51:25,780
There's no way, right?

1120
00:51:30,110 --> 00:51:30,610
Ugh!

1121
00:51:30,670 --> 00:51:32,930
Whenever I'm in a loading screen, I know I'm safe.

1122
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:37,230
Oh hey!

1123
00:51:39,390 --> 00:51:39,890
It's...

1124
00:51:39,890 --> 00:51:40,750
Oh my god!

1125
00:51:40,810 --> 00:51:41,570
I remember Lloyd!

1126
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:46,820
That's professional!

1127
00:51:49,140 --> 00:51:50,360
People started drawing!

1128
00:51:52,140 --> 00:51:53,820
Adult art of him already!

1129
00:51:56,300 --> 00:51:57,680
Just like Tony the Tiger!

1130
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:02,280
What?

1131
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:10,380
You know the Tony the Tiger thing that happened?

1132
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:15,340
Where like, people started getting horny for Tony.

1133
00:52:15,540 --> 00:52:20,740
That like, the guy who played Tony the Tiger got so uncomfortable that he just stopped...

1134
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:21,820
...VTubing.

1135
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:23,580
So, where do you wanna go?

1136
00:52:26,300 --> 00:52:27,120
I don't know.

1137
00:52:27,220 --> 00:52:28,080
Wait, is that Molly?

1138
00:52:29,620 --> 00:52:30,580
Wait a minute.

1139
00:52:32,700 --> 00:52:33,660
Wait a minute.

1140
00:52:34,460 --> 00:52:34,980
Wait a minute.

1141
00:52:34,980 --> 00:52:35,900
That looks like Molly.

1142
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:40,620
Wait a minute.

1143
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:45,680
Oh, I wanna get my expensive...

1144
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:46,580
...Rambly ears!

1145
00:52:47,940 --> 00:52:49,440
That shit is like...

1146
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:50,000
...$50!

1147
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:52,240
I want one!

1148
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:55,800
Ooh!

1149
00:52:56,140 --> 00:52:57,320
That's a swamp!

1150
00:52:57,960 --> 00:53:00,460
Ooh, the water is not looking so good.

1151
00:53:01,020 --> 00:53:02,420
Oh yeah, she wants my autograph.

1152
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:03,260
That's true.

1153
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:04,700
That's true.

1154
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:06,560
She heard I'm gonna be on a Spencer's.

1155
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:09,980
It's very...

1156
00:53:09,980 --> 00:53:10,260
Spencer's!

1157
00:53:10,700 --> 00:53:15,120
If anybody is like a relative of a Spencer's executive...

1158
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:16,060
Call me.

1159
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:17,680
My...

1160
00:53:19,140 --> 00:53:20,620
My email is...

1161
00:53:20,620 --> 00:53:22,040
My email is...

1162
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:23,480
Tell them that like...

1163
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:24,660
They won't regret it.

1164
00:53:27,560 --> 00:53:29,920
There must be one person...

1165
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:32,120
...who's like a cousin...

1166
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:33,560
...of a cousin...

1167
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:35,600
...of a Spencer's executive.

1168
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:36,820
...of a Spencer's executive.

1169
00:53:37,180 --> 00:53:39,280
There has to be one Dragoon.

1170
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:41,260
The author of...

1171
00:53:41,260 --> 00:53:42,140
...Lifetime.

1172
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:44,160
Alright.

1173
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:46,360
My business email is...

1174
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:48,200
...Doki can't read any...

1175
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:49,260
...execs in chat.

1176
00:53:49,540 --> 00:53:50,460
Oh, over here?

1177
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:53,180
Oh my gosh, the clock is freaking out.

1178
00:53:54,300 --> 00:53:56,440
This here is an information kiosk.

1179
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:56,660
Okay.

1180
00:53:56,980 --> 00:53:59,280
If there's anything around the park you wanna ask me about...

1181
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:02,420
...just stop by here and I'll ramble on about it.

1182
00:54:02,420 --> 00:54:02,600
Hmm.

1183
00:54:02,780 --> 00:54:03,920
I always need help.

1184
00:54:05,300 --> 00:54:06,820
Oh, a mommy plush!

1185
00:54:06,940 --> 00:54:08,600
She's always been my best friend.

1186
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:10,320
Did you know she builds planes...

1187
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:11,880
My dad's name is Spencer.

1188
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:12,800
Does that count?

1189
00:54:16,020 --> 00:54:18,080
Oh, I can just talk about...

1190
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:18,980
Oh my gosh, the...

1191
00:54:19,540 --> 00:54:20,060
...the...

1192
00:54:21,980 --> 00:54:23,200
...the U2's figure.

1193
00:54:23,900 --> 00:54:24,720
Oh, I got this.

1194
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:25,860
I know the commercial by heart.

1195
00:54:27,860 --> 00:54:29,940
Wow, it's the unlimited edition...

1196
00:54:29,940 --> 00:54:31,520
...Grammily the Raccoon Raction figure.

1197
00:54:31,780 --> 00:54:33,020
Push him down and he jumps.

1198
00:54:33,140 --> 00:54:34,400
Push him up and he doesn't.

1199
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:36,960
Only $19.99 at your favorite toy store.

1200
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:38,840
Only $19.99?

1201
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:41,100
What a fucking steal.

1202
00:54:41,580 --> 00:54:43,540
Well, since it's an abandoned theme park...

1203
00:54:43,540 --> 00:54:44,140
...it should be even more expensive.

1204
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:46,500
People love...

1205
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:47,660
Collectors love that shit.

1206
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:49,460
When things get abandoned...

1207
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:52,580
When things get abandoned...

1208
00:54:52,580 --> 00:54:53,760
...and the prices are like...

1209
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:54,720
...triple the price.

1210
00:54:55,020 --> 00:54:55,980
Is this a pizzeria?

1211
00:54:56,320 --> 00:54:57,200
Or a restaurant?

1212
00:54:57,900 --> 00:55:00,480
Well, there's no reason for me to be at the restaurant...

1213
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:01,520
...so let me just move forward.

1214
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:07,340
I don't think there's a reason for me to be up there.

1215
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:08,640
Not so deadpo...

1216
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:09,420
Thank you for the super chat.

1217
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:09,800
Thank you.

1218
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:10,460
Thank you.

1219
00:55:12,420 --> 00:55:12,980
Uh...

1220
00:55:12,980 --> 00:55:13,780
I'm scared.

1221
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:16,600
I don't know where to go, guys.

1222
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:18,880
Uh...

1223
00:55:20,860 --> 00:55:23,280
The only doors open is the restaurant.

1224
00:55:24,940 --> 00:55:26,940
But what if collectables?

1225
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:29,680
This looks like a pizzeria.

1226
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:34,560
Where the fuck...

1227
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:36,340
Didn't I supposed to have a friend with me?

1228
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:38,040
What happened to my friend?

1229
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:41,340
That's supposed to go to the abandoned place with me.

1230
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:43,100
Café de...

1231
00:55:43,100 --> 00:55:44,400
...Rachon La Vie.

1232
00:55:45,420 --> 00:55:46,720
Guys, don't judge my French.

1233
00:55:47,980 --> 00:55:49,700
Oh, is there like collectable in here?

1234
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:52,480
Oh my god, there's still pastries in there.

1235
00:55:52,900 --> 00:55:53,380
Oh...

1236
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:55,320
Mold flavor.

1237
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:57,320
Can I bring that?

1238
00:55:57,400 --> 00:55:57,720
Nice.

1239
00:55:58,040 --> 00:55:58,520
Alright.

1240
00:55:59,120 --> 00:56:00,600
Is there anything else in there?

1241
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:01,440
No, it's just garbage.

1242
00:56:04,140 --> 00:56:04,620
Chocolate.

1243
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:05,660
How much is it?

1244
00:56:05,740 --> 00:56:07,540
A chocolate cookie is $4?

1245
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:11,280
For one tiny fucking cookie?

1246
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:12,820
For one tiny fucking cookie?

1247
00:56:12,820 --> 00:56:15,820
A Subway cookie is two Canadian dollars.

1248
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:20,200
Bro, what a fucking scam.

1249
00:56:21,020 --> 00:56:24,180
A caramel apple is $9.50?

1250
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:25,880
That apple...

1251
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:30,280
better come from a fucking apple tree from the president or some shit.

1252
00:56:30,660 --> 00:56:31,000
Like...

1253
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:35,060
That's one apple.

1254
00:56:35,340 --> 00:56:35,660
That's one apple.

1255
00:56:37,020 --> 00:56:38,020
This is so stupid.

1256
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:39,100
Disney Land prices.

1257
00:56:39,900 --> 00:56:41,120
Like, why...

1258
00:56:41,950 --> 00:56:43,120
Bro, that apple...

1259
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:46,300
better be grown on some fucking famous person's backyard.

1260
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:48,540
For $9.50.

1261
00:56:50,860 --> 00:56:53,480
No wonder it was closed.

1262
00:56:54,260 --> 00:56:56,440
Bro, what the fuck is a Rambly Special?

1263
00:56:58,200 --> 00:56:59,060
Jesus.

1264
00:57:01,730 --> 00:57:04,300
It's not even an enchanted apple.

1265
00:57:04,580 --> 00:57:06,400
How fucking dare they.

1266
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:08,020
Maybe I should go to the...

1267
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:08,660
Lloyd's Theater.

1268
00:57:09,180 --> 00:57:10,700
Lloyd seems like a cool guy.

1269
00:57:12,820 --> 00:57:14,280
I wanna go to his...

1270
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:14,560
theater.

1271
00:57:15,740 --> 00:57:17,360
Wait, I can't?

1272
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:19,040
But I have the Fastpass!

1273
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:20,780
Oh my god.

1274
00:57:22,340 --> 00:57:24,000
I think Rambly hates Lloyd.

1275
00:57:24,300 --> 00:57:26,080
He purposely not gave me...

1276
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:27,180
a Fastpass for Lloyd.

1277
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:32,000
Can't believe it.

1278
00:57:32,140 --> 00:57:33,300
God damn it, Rambly.

1279
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:35,600
It's not my fault that...

1280
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:36,500
Lloyd is better.

1281
00:57:36,500 --> 00:57:38,800
Lloyd is like the Donald Duck of Disney.

1282
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:41,620
People like Donald more than Mickey.

1283
00:57:41,780 --> 00:57:42,800
And Mickey hates that.

1284
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:46,880
Snooks, thank you for the super chat.

1285
00:57:46,940 --> 00:57:47,220
Thank you.

1286
00:57:47,620 --> 00:57:50,360
Can you get me a Rambly Special?

1287
00:57:50,540 --> 00:57:52,220
Thank you for the super chat.

1288
00:57:52,380 --> 00:57:52,660
Thank you.

1289
00:57:53,340 --> 00:57:55,340
I guess it's here, right?

1290
00:57:57,340 --> 00:57:59,300
Yeah, the reason why people like...

1291
00:57:59,300 --> 00:58:00,520
Oh hey, another collectible.

1292
00:58:00,780 --> 00:58:02,660
The reason why people like...

1293
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:04,240
uh...

1294
00:58:04,860 --> 00:58:07,260
Donald more than Mickey is because...

1295
00:58:07,260 --> 00:58:10,940
Disney has made Mickey so fucking bland now.

1296
00:58:11,140 --> 00:58:12,680
Because he's like a...

1297
00:58:12,680 --> 00:58:13,720
What is it?

1298
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:15,420
He's like a blank canvas.

1299
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:17,220
Where like, um...

1300
00:58:17,220 --> 00:58:20,080
He has to be like super child friendly and everything...

1301
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:21,540
with zero personality now.

1302
00:58:21,820 --> 00:58:22,340
Look at that!

1303
00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:24,220
You're at Jetstream Junction!

1304
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:24,540
Yeah!

1305
00:58:24,900 --> 00:58:27,640
Looks like Jetstream Junction is being tuned up!

1306
00:58:27,780 --> 00:58:30,100
Donald can actually have a personality.

1307
00:58:31,060 --> 00:58:33,660
Maybe a friendly Wrangler can help you get in!

1308
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:34,220
Maybe a friendly Wrangler can help you get in!

1309
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:36,840
Mickey Friendly Wrangler?

1310
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:39,700
Mickey Friendly Wrangler?

1311
00:58:39,700 --> 00:58:41,660
Who the fuck is a friendly Wrangler?

1312
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:44,720
Rambly!

1313
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:46,360
Who's a Wrangler?

1314
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:51,340
What the fuck does Wrangler even mean?

1315
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:52,700
I don't know your lingo!

1316
00:58:55,980 --> 00:58:58,340
Isn't the latest Mickey cartoon pretty neat?

1317
00:58:58,680 --> 00:58:58,780
Isn't the latest Mickey cartoon pretty neat?

1318
00:58:58,780 --> 00:59:01,140
Do you know when that Mickey cartoon came out?

1319
00:59:01,540 --> 00:59:03,320
They don't do those anymore.

1320
00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:04,740
I don't know if they do those anymore.

1321
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:06,760
That was like...

1322
00:59:07,360 --> 00:59:08,360
10 years ago.

1323
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:16,000
I want a cookie you can keep the one dollar.

1324
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:17,740
Gary, thank you for the super chat!

1325
00:59:17,820 --> 00:59:18,060
Thank you!

1326
00:59:19,360 --> 00:59:21,980
You know the one word that Mickey was like, What happened?

1327
00:59:23,240 --> 00:59:24,940
That episode was like...

1328
00:59:24,940 --> 00:59:26,940
I think like 6 plus years ago.

1329
00:59:35,710 --> 00:59:36,910
Can I use this now?

1330
00:59:37,930 --> 00:59:40,220
I can!

1331
00:59:41,620 --> 00:59:42,360
Yay!

1332
00:59:42,660 --> 00:59:44,300
I can go to Lloyd now!

1333
00:59:46,680 --> 00:59:48,120
My game crashed.

1334
00:59:49,100 --> 00:59:49,840
Fuck!

1335
00:59:53,080 --> 00:59:53,820
Rambly!

1336
00:59:54,120 --> 00:59:56,660
Why can't I visit Lloyd?

1337
00:59:58,180 --> 01:00:01,020
Rambly does not want me to see Lloyd!

1338
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:04,000
Rambly does not want me to see Lloyd!

1339
01:00:04,980 --> 01:00:05,720
Rambly does not want me to see Lloyd!

1340
01:00:05,720 --> 01:00:10,340
The moment I wanted to see Lloyd, Rambly pulled the plug.

1341
01:00:11,600 --> 01:00:14,080
I can't believe it, Rambly!

1342
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:15,520
Let me see Lloyd!

1343
01:00:16,600 --> 01:00:19,220
Let me see Lloyd!

1344
01:00:19,220 --> 01:00:20,700
Let me see Lloyd!

1345
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:20,860
Let me see Lloyd!

1346
01:00:20,860 --> 01:00:21,100
Yay!

1347
01:00:22,060 --> 01:00:24,440
Okay, I loaded into Lloyd's world.

1348
01:00:24,660 --> 01:00:25,240
Whoa!

1349
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:26,880
What the fuck?

1350
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:28,800
Lloyd, are you okay?

1351
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:30,520
Whoa!

1352
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:32,140
That's a real lion!

1353
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:35,660
Wait a minute.

1354
01:00:36,020 --> 01:00:38,620
Guys, I think this might be a horror game.

1355
01:00:44,680 --> 01:00:45,820
That's a real lion!

1356
01:00:46,060 --> 01:00:48,880
Who the fuck let this lion in here?

1357
01:00:50,280 --> 01:00:51,060
It's real?

1358
01:00:52,800 --> 01:00:56,540
He just brought in a real lion and then put a shirt on it.

1359
01:00:58,680 --> 01:01:00,560
Did they like put a shirt on a lion?

1360
01:01:01,080 --> 01:01:05,560
Hey buddy, I've got eyes all over the park, but I can't see anything behind the stage.

1361
01:01:05,740 --> 01:01:07,320
If you're going back there, be careful.

1362
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:08,600
Your critic card was not in the game.

1363
01:01:08,620 --> 01:01:09,940
I'm not able to resuscitate you.

1364
01:01:10,860 --> 01:01:12,540
Not able to resusc...

1365
01:01:12,540 --> 01:01:13,040
Not yet.

1366
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:15,820
What happens if the lion kills me?

1367
01:01:18,040 --> 01:01:18,560
Hello?

1368
01:01:19,260 --> 01:01:20,440
I should start running.

1369
01:01:21,320 --> 01:01:22,720
Ooh, I should stop running.

1370
01:01:24,460 --> 01:01:24,980
Ugh.

1371
01:01:25,340 --> 01:01:28,620
It gives me the ability to sprint, but I don't feel so good.

1372
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:29,800
It gives me the ability to sprint, but I don't feel so good.

1373
01:01:30,780 --> 01:01:33,180
I know I can sprint, but I just...

1374
01:01:33,180 --> 01:01:35,060
I know I can sprint, but I just...

1375
01:01:35,060 --> 01:01:37,320
I feel like sprinting just feels wrong.

1376
01:01:37,640 --> 01:01:37,800
I feel like sprinting just feels wrong.

1377
01:01:37,800 --> 01:01:38,600
It feels so bad.

1378
01:01:38,620 --> 01:01:39,000
It feels so wrong.

1379
01:01:41,980 --> 01:01:43,980
Alright, let's bring the one volume...

1380
01:01:43,980 --> 01:01:46,460
Okay, we'll bring the volume slider down to...

1381
01:01:46,460 --> 01:01:49,460
Our one volume slider down to 75.

1382
01:01:50,580 --> 01:01:52,620
Why is it one volume?

1383
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:55,720
Where are the other volumes?

1384
01:01:56,780 --> 01:01:57,540
Let's see.

1385
01:01:58,360 --> 01:02:01,180
As long as there's no blood on the floor, everything's fine.

1386
01:02:02,660 --> 01:02:04,620
It's just old cardboard boxes.

1387
01:02:05,640 --> 01:02:07,860
There's no blood on the floor, so like...

1388
01:02:08,620 --> 01:02:10,100
The park is very safe, chat.

1389
01:02:10,660 --> 01:02:12,700
That's when you know the park is safe.

1390
01:02:12,760 --> 01:02:13,400
There's no blood.

1391
01:02:14,560 --> 01:02:16,020
That's my point of reference.

1392
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:23,360
If nobody dies, then we're okay.

1393
01:02:25,720 --> 01:02:27,440
What is that ambient?

1394
01:02:27,940 --> 01:02:28,360
Bling!

1395
01:02:29,960 --> 01:02:30,560
Bling!

1396
01:02:31,340 --> 01:02:32,520
I don't like that.

1397
01:02:33,620 --> 01:02:34,500
Oh, hey dude.

1398
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:36,420
Oh, that's a big Lloyd statue.

1399
01:02:40,280 --> 01:02:40,980
Lloyd?

1400
01:02:41,940 --> 01:02:42,640
Hello.

1401
01:02:44,010 --> 01:02:44,560
Hey, Lloyd.

1402
01:02:44,860 --> 01:02:45,500
Hey.

1403
01:02:50,360 --> 01:02:51,320
Hey, Lloyd.

1404
01:02:53,040 --> 01:02:54,660
What the fuck?

1405
01:02:57,020 --> 01:02:58,700
Bro, what the fuck?

1406
01:03:00,260 --> 01:03:01,240
There's Lloyd.

1407
01:03:01,240 --> 01:03:01,280
There's Lloyd.

1408
01:03:03,240 --> 01:03:05,680
He doesn't seem so bad, guys.

1409
01:03:06,580 --> 01:03:07,780
Guys, I don't know.

1410
01:03:07,840 --> 01:03:08,800
He seems pretty friendly.

1411
01:03:09,380 --> 01:03:11,820
He looks like he just wants a hug.

1412
01:03:11,980 --> 01:03:13,240
He's a little embarrassed, guys.

1413
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:14,300
He's a little embarrassed.

1414
01:03:16,460 --> 01:03:17,580
Bro dipped.

1415
01:03:18,040 --> 01:03:21,440
After getting crushed by like empty cardboard boxes.

1416
01:03:21,780 --> 01:03:22,240
After getting crushed by like empty cardboard boxes.

1417
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:22,560
Like...

1418
01:03:23,580 --> 01:03:25,920
Those boxes seem like empty too.

1419
01:03:26,020 --> 01:03:28,800
It's not like an actual box filled with stuff.

1420
01:03:29,300 --> 01:03:30,360
It's not like an actual box filled with stuff.

1421
01:03:32,760 --> 01:03:33,200
Hey, hey, hey.

1422
01:03:34,220 --> 01:03:35,080
Where's Rambly?

1423
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:36,380
Did I just walk backwards?

1424
01:03:36,740 --> 01:03:38,360
I guess I just walked backwards, right?

1425
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:40,500
Free hug.

1426
01:03:42,620 --> 01:03:44,240
Got me a free hug, guys.

1427
01:03:45,420 --> 01:03:46,160
I don't know.

1428
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:47,280
He seems extra cuddly.

1429
01:03:47,860 --> 01:03:49,060
Doesn't seem so bad.

1430
01:03:49,900 --> 01:03:51,580
Neppers, thank you for the super chat.

1431
01:03:51,700 --> 01:03:52,620
Thank you, thank you.

1432
01:03:52,920 --> 01:03:54,540
I'm just like, hey, Lloyd.

1433
01:03:55,960 --> 01:03:57,520
Do you want another hug, Lloyd?

1434
01:03:57,860 --> 01:03:58,840
Wait, do I have to...

1435
01:03:58,840 --> 01:04:00,260
Wait, this is a new area, right?

1436
01:04:03,040 --> 01:04:04,660
No, this is where Lloyd came out.

1437
01:04:05,720 --> 01:04:06,580
I'm pretty sure.

1438
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:08,500
I want Lloyd to hug me.

1439
01:04:08,900 --> 01:04:10,080
I wanna see what happens.

1440
01:04:10,260 --> 01:04:11,480
Like, do I get reset fully?

1441
01:04:12,060 --> 01:04:14,740
Or does he just stop and was like, you're supposed to run.

1442
01:04:14,840 --> 01:04:17,320
Or does the game just make him stop because you're confused.

1443
01:04:17,820 --> 01:04:21,100
Because you're like, wait, a regular player would just run.

1444
01:04:24,980 --> 01:04:25,960
I want that.

1445
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:28,820
I wanna take that home and sell it on eBay.

1446
01:04:28,840 --> 01:04:30,720
That shit might go crazy.

1447
01:04:31,220 --> 01:04:36,580
Lloyd seems like the type of character that must have like, a lot of like, uh...

1448
01:04:36,580 --> 01:04:37,240
What's it called?

1449
01:04:37,340 --> 01:04:38,000
Occult following.

1450
01:04:38,200 --> 01:04:40,900
I feel like Lloyd seems like the occult following character.

1451
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:44,620
Where like, his stuff can go for a crazy amount of money.

1452
01:04:45,160 --> 01:04:45,420
Where like, his stuff can go for a crazy amount of money.

1453
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:46,240
Alright.

1454
01:04:47,960 --> 01:04:48,520
Beep.

1455
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:51,880
Whoa, Lloyd!

1456
01:04:52,660 --> 01:04:53,440
Hey, Lloyd.

1457
01:04:53,720 --> 01:04:55,380
Ah, fuck you little pussy.

1458
01:04:55,380 --> 01:04:57,380
What the fuck?

1459
01:05:02,340 --> 01:05:03,800
What the fuck?

1460
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:04,580
You fucking bitch.

1461
01:05:06,740 --> 01:05:08,680
You fucking bitch.

1462
01:05:11,420 --> 01:05:13,420
What a little bitch boy.

1463
01:05:14,100 --> 01:05:14,900
Lloyd.

1464
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:18,700
Wait, where's my flashlight?

1465
01:05:19,180 --> 01:05:20,420
Did my flashlight stop working?

1466
01:05:21,260 --> 01:05:23,260
Where was I supposed to go?

1467
01:05:27,320 --> 01:05:29,400
Did you try- How do I- Oh, there you go.

1468
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:31,640
I was like, where did my light go?

1469
01:05:32,920 --> 01:05:33,360
Alright.

1470
01:05:34,900 --> 01:05:36,320
What just happened?

1471
01:05:36,540 --> 01:05:37,960
I don't even know.

1472
01:05:38,380 --> 01:05:40,920
Wait, he touched me and was like, Oh!

1473
01:05:44,180 --> 01:05:47,940
Look, look, I've been urban exploring for a very long time, guys.

1474
01:05:48,040 --> 01:05:49,040
Okay, it's not my fault.

1475
01:05:49,380 --> 01:05:49,820
Okay.

1476
01:05:51,160 --> 01:05:52,200
It's not my fault.

1477
01:05:53,020 --> 01:05:55,420
I haven't had time to go home yet, guys.

1478
01:05:56,280 --> 01:05:56,960
I haven't had time to go home yet, guys.

1479
01:05:57,660 --> 01:05:59,180
Please take a shower.

1480
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:00,020
It's not my fault!

1481
01:06:03,340 --> 01:06:05,760
Urban exploring is a hard job.

1482
01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:08,280
Sometimes I don't have time to take a shower.

1483
01:06:11,120 --> 01:06:12,620
It's physical, God.

1484
01:06:12,980 --> 01:06:15,560
Donkey, don't put- Don't shame.

1485
01:06:15,720 --> 01:06:16,500
It's 2024.

1486
01:06:17,220 --> 01:06:18,440
Shake my head.

1487
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:19,940
Thank you for the super chat.

1488
01:06:20,020 --> 01:06:20,600
Alright, thank you.

1489
01:06:20,600 --> 01:06:21,200
Thank you.

1490
01:06:21,700 --> 01:06:22,880
Thank you for the super chat.

1491
01:06:22,940 --> 01:06:23,240
Thank you.

1492
01:06:23,260 --> 01:06:23,820
Thank you.

1493
01:06:23,900 --> 01:06:26,340
Why are you so harsh on him?

1494
01:06:26,440 --> 01:06:27,680
He's just trying to say hi.

1495
01:06:28,040 --> 01:06:29,080
Thank you for the super chat.

1496
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:29,440
Thank you.

1497
01:06:30,640 --> 01:06:33,140
Hello, bitch.

1498
01:06:36,840 --> 01:06:38,860
Like, what the heck was that?

1499
01:06:42,820 --> 01:06:43,900
Mascot horror games.

1500
01:06:46,760 --> 01:06:48,420
In my back, guys.

1501
01:06:57,360 --> 01:06:59,980
Guys, we're not bullying Lloyd anymore.

1502
01:07:00,140 --> 01:07:01,200
I'm sorry to Lloyd.

1503
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:03,440
Okay.

1504
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:06,140
Regarding update on the new PC.

1505
01:07:06,860 --> 01:07:10,020
I am like 80% done setting it up.

1506
01:07:12,360 --> 01:07:13,640
I am like 80% done setting it up.

1507
01:07:13,640 --> 01:07:15,800
Guys, I'm 80% done.

1508
01:07:16,040 --> 01:07:18,840
Guys, I'm 80% done.

1509
01:07:18,920 --> 01:07:21,000
Guys, I'm 80% done setting up the new PC, guys.

1510
01:07:21,140 --> 01:07:21,300
Guys, I'm 80% done setting up the new PC, guys.

1511
01:07:21,300 --> 01:07:21,500
Guys, I'm 80% done setting up the new PC, guys.

1512
01:07:21,500 --> 01:07:21,980
I promise.

1513
01:07:22,180 --> 01:07:23,820
It's almost done.

1514
01:07:23,860 --> 01:07:25,040
I was moving fast.

1515
01:07:25,160 --> 01:07:25,820
I was moving the files, okay?

1516
01:07:25,940 --> 01:07:29,260
I didn't have time to finish moving the files.

1517
01:07:29,820 --> 01:07:31,700
But also, I deserved that.

1518
01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:33,760
I'm so sorry to Lloyd.

1519
01:07:34,120 --> 01:07:34,640
I...

1520
01:07:34,640 --> 01:07:41,540
I apologize to Lloyd.

1521
01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:43,900
I'm so sorry, Lloyd.

1522
01:07:44,080 --> 01:07:46,960
I did not mean to bully you.

1523
01:07:47,580 --> 01:07:49,140
I'm so sorry.

1524
01:07:49,240 --> 01:07:51,220
I'm sorry for calling you a pussy.

1525
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:53,120
I'm sorry.

1526
01:07:53,140 --> 01:07:55,140
Because technically you are a pussycat.

1527
01:07:59,420 --> 01:08:01,040
I'm so sorry.

1528
01:08:01,940 --> 01:08:04,340
I didn't mean it, Lloyd.

1529
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:07,720
Please let me at least finish this game.

1530
01:08:08,860 --> 01:08:13,300
So I think my PC is like about to die.

1531
01:08:15,260 --> 01:08:19,880
Because if you guys were not there for the Zen Amelie collab.

1532
01:08:20,020 --> 01:08:20,880
Because I didn't stream it.

1533
01:08:21,100 --> 01:08:22,960
But like I did tweet it out.

1534
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:25,140
But like my PC was like...

1535
01:08:25,140 --> 01:08:28,480
crashing and blue screening almost every game.

1536
01:08:28,840 --> 01:08:29,880
So then I was like...

1537
01:08:29,880 --> 01:08:30,480
Oh, I think...

1538
01:08:30,480 --> 01:08:33,320
I think it's time to retire this game.

1539
01:08:34,760 --> 01:08:35,820
I think...

1540
01:08:35,820 --> 01:08:39,240
I think my PC is finally at its death bed, guys.

1541
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:45,260
So I was like...

1542
01:08:45,260 --> 01:08:46,140
Slowly...

1543
01:08:46,140 --> 01:08:47,760
Not slowly, but I was actually...

1544
01:08:47,760 --> 01:08:52,420
Because I still have like a million other projects I'm working on behind the scenes as well.

1545
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:54,900
So I've been like moving files and everything.

1546
01:08:54,900 --> 01:08:55,120
So I've been like moving files and everything.

1547
01:08:55,680 --> 01:08:56,600
Oh, this is horrible.

1548
01:09:00,980 --> 01:09:01,420
No!

1549
01:09:01,420 --> 01:09:01,860
Molly!

1550
01:09:04,480 --> 01:09:05,540
You know what I think?

1551
01:09:06,040 --> 01:09:07,360
What I think I need to do?

1552
01:09:07,760 --> 01:09:09,440
I do not think we need...

1553
01:09:10,460 --> 01:09:11,960
I don't think we need Epic.

1554
01:09:20,420 --> 01:09:21,940
She crashed to Molly!

1555
01:09:22,120 --> 01:09:22,360
No!

1556
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:24,940
You should have also got a new PC!

1557
01:09:25,420 --> 01:09:25,860
Hey!

1558
01:09:27,280 --> 01:09:31,020
It was Lloyd's first time interacting with a girl and you laughed at him.

1559
01:09:31,140 --> 01:09:32,500
Are you thinking of the Super Chat?

1560
01:09:32,660 --> 01:09:33,000
Thank you.

1561
01:09:33,140 --> 01:09:33,540
Thank you.

1562
01:09:34,820 --> 01:09:35,320
Say!

1563
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,020
Why don't you check out Molly's landing pad?

1564
01:09:38,300 --> 01:09:39,420
It's not far from here.

1565
01:09:39,440 --> 01:09:41,680
And it's a great cool down after that exhilarating ride.

1566
01:09:42,060 --> 01:09:44,800
Just take a down from Molly's rooftop races.

1567
01:09:45,700 --> 01:09:48,120
Just take a down from Molly's rooftop races?

1568
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:48,580
Just take a down from Molly's rooftop races?

1569
01:09:48,580 --> 01:09:48,740
Just take a down from Molly's rooftop races?

1570
01:09:48,900 --> 01:09:49,920
What, like here?

1571
01:09:52,460 --> 01:09:52,960
Alright.

1572
01:09:53,620 --> 01:09:55,040
So yeah, like...

1573
01:09:55,040 --> 01:09:56,060
I swear guys.

1574
01:09:56,300 --> 01:09:56,960
I will...

1575
01:09:58,740 --> 01:09:59,180
Tomorrow...

1576
01:09:59,180 --> 01:09:59,920
Wait.

1577
01:10:00,780 --> 01:10:01,400
That's Molly.

1578
01:10:02,500 --> 01:10:03,280
That's my plane.

1579
01:10:05,620 --> 01:10:06,060
Wait.

1580
01:10:06,100 --> 01:10:06,620
Where do I go?

1581
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:08,980
Do I go this way?

1582
01:10:10,160 --> 01:10:10,600
Zy!

1583
01:10:10,620 --> 01:10:11,380
Thank you for the Super Chat!

1584
01:10:11,460 --> 01:10:11,720
Thank you!

1585
01:10:12,260 --> 01:10:13,760
Yesterday was my birthday.

1586
01:10:13,880 --> 01:10:14,600
Thank you...

1587
01:10:15,220 --> 01:10:17,600
for being an inspiration as a gamer and streamer.

1588
01:10:17,640 --> 01:10:19,380
After all these years and months.

1589
01:10:19,620 --> 01:10:21,040
I enjoy my time here.

1590
01:10:21,120 --> 01:10:22,120
Feeling laughter and smile.

1591
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:23,280
I just turned 32.

1592
01:10:23,740 --> 01:10:24,500
Oh my god!

1593
01:10:24,540 --> 01:10:25,620
You're older than Shroud!

1594
01:10:25,740 --> 01:10:27,200
Thank you for the Super Chat, Zy!

1595
01:10:27,280 --> 01:10:27,520
Thank you!

1596
01:10:28,360 --> 01:10:29,520
Oh my god!

1597
01:10:30,780 --> 01:10:32,220
You're just like Shroud!

1598
01:10:33,340 --> 01:10:35,240
Happy birthday to you!

1599
01:10:35,460 --> 01:10:37,280
Happy birthday to you!

1600
01:10:37,380 --> 01:10:39,100
Happy birthday dear Zy!

1601
01:10:39,160 --> 01:10:40,780
Happy birthday to you!

1602
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:41,460
Oh shit!

1603
01:10:41,540 --> 01:10:42,680
Now we're back to...

1604
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:43,920
FNAFing time!

1605
01:10:48,180 --> 01:10:49,560
Do I need to...

1606
01:10:49,560 --> 01:10:50,720
actually know this puzzle?

1607
01:10:51,800 --> 01:10:53,560
Oh no, this is FNAF.

1608
01:10:53,680 --> 01:10:56,360
Bum bum bum bum bum bum bum...

1609
01:10:56,360 --> 01:10:57,600
Bum bum...

1610
01:10:57,600 --> 01:10:59,920
Do I just turn it until it works?

1611
01:11:00,720 --> 01:11:01,820
I don't like this!

1612
01:11:01,860 --> 01:11:02,960
This song is too happy!

1613
01:11:05,240 --> 01:11:07,440
I feel uncomfortable!

1614
01:11:07,880 --> 01:11:08,080
I feel uncomfortable!

1615
01:11:11,620 --> 01:11:12,320
I feel uncomfortable!

1616
01:11:12,320 --> 01:11:13,680
Just put a random fucking...

1617
01:11:13,680 --> 01:11:14,140
What?

1618
01:11:15,500 --> 01:11:16,020
Oh...

1619
01:11:17,260 --> 01:11:18,300
Oh no...

1620
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,220
Oh now I'm definitely uncomfortable.

1621
01:11:22,380 --> 01:11:22,900
Oh...

1622
01:11:23,420 --> 01:11:24,620
Oh no...

1623
01:11:24,620 --> 01:11:27,920
Oh I can feel like Molly is definitely gonna come here.

1624
01:11:28,840 --> 01:11:29,860
Oh I can feel like Molly is definitely gonna come here.

1625
01:11:29,860 --> 01:11:30,900
Oh come on Molly!

1626
01:11:31,140 --> 01:11:32,260
That's not cool!

1627
01:11:33,540 --> 01:11:34,100
Molly!

1628
01:11:34,340 --> 01:11:36,140

That was no- bro.

1767
01:17:02,550 --> 01:17:05,090
Molly can repeat words, don't be fooled.

1768
01:17:05,190 --> 01:17:06,770
Repeat what words?

1769
01:17:07,830 --> 01:17:09,150
What the fuck?

1770
01:17:09,730 --> 01:17:10,770
That's my play.

1771
01:17:13,210 --> 01:17:15,210
She did not look like that.

1772
01:17:15,350 --> 01:17:18,350
I was like, that was not what Molly looked like.

1773
01:17:20,130 --> 01:17:20,710
Damn.

01:17:20,990 --> 01:17:24,190
Bro, why is Molly scarier than the fucking...

1775
01:17:24,790 --> 01:17:26,870
...than the fucking lion?

1776
01:17:28,610 --> 01:17:29,410
I don't know.

1777
01:17:29,490 --> 01:17:31,790
I didn't realize she was behind me.

1778
01:17:35,850 --> 01:17:36,430
Alright.

1779
01:17:36,710 --> 01:17:38,310
I have to go here.

1780
01:17:38,730 --> 01:17:40,430
It's not fair, my back was turned.

1781
01:17:44,650 --> 01:17:45,130

That's not fair!

1787
01:18:02,040 --> 01:18:03,400
That's not fair!

1788
01:18:07,880 --> 01:18:09,960
Might as well not even run!

1789
01:18:10,700 --> 01:18:12,100
Might as well just walk!

1790
01:18:15,300 --> 01:18:16,620
That's so bullshit.

1791
01:18:16,620 --> 01:18:19,460
Bro, I hate these types of games.

1792
01:18:20,800 --> 01:18:22,100
That's so bullshit!

1793
01:18:22,620 --> 01:18:23,540

That's good to know.

1799
01:18:33,300 --> 01:18:35,260
That's good to know it's set pathways.

1800
01:18:36,040 --> 01:18:36,560
Left!

1801
01:18:37,120 --> 01:18:37,640

1807
01:18:46,440 --> 01:18:48,440
Alright, she's not gonna appear here, right?

1808
01:18:48,900 --> 01:18:49,700
Oh nice.

1809
01:18:49,820 --> 01:18:50,040
Okay.

1810
01:18:50,160 --> 01:18:51,920
Alright, I gambled correctly guys.

1811
01:18:52,220 --> 01:18:53,680
Oh my god, I'm so smart.

1812
01:18:53,860 --> 01:18:55,600
I gambled correctly guys.

1813
01:18:55,860 --> 01:18:58,780
Guys, I need you guys to remember the pathways for me guys!

1814
01:19:00,540 --> 01:19:01,060
AHHHHH!

1815
01:19:03,590 --> 01:19:04,610
This is bad.

1816
01:19:05,530 --> 01:19:06,890
This is so bad.

1817
01:19:06,950 --> 01:19:07,650
Where am I?

1818
01:19:09,050 --> 01:19:10,570
This is so bad.

1819
01:19:10,830 --> 01:19:13,710
I don't know where I ran off to.

1820
01:19:14,790 --> 01:19:15,310
NOOOO!

1821
01:19:19,730 --> 01:19:20,250
NOOOO!

1822
01:19:22,970 --> 01:19:25,550
I jumped into here!

1823
01:19:26,190 --> 01:19:26,910
NOOOO!

1824
01:19:28,390 --> 01:19:32,010
Bro, this is where 80% of the game is.

1825
01:19:32,590 --> 01:19:34,790
I got baited!

1826
01:19:34,810 --> 01:19:36,430
I'm so lost!

1827
01:19:37,870 --> 01:19:38,590
No!

1828
01:19:39,390 --> 01:19:40,110
Okay.

1829
01:19:41,710 --> 01:19:42,430
Alright.

1830
01:19:43,170 --> 01:19:44,910
That one was so unfair.

1831
01:19:46,550 --> 01:19:47,590
It was.

1832
01:19:47,590 --> 01:19:48,390
It's so unfair.

1833
01:19:48,550 --> 01:19:48,750
Okay.

1834
01:19:48,810 --> 01:19:49,270
Left.

1835
01:19:49,410 --> 01:19:50,250
Left and right.

1836
01:19:50,270 --> 01:19:50,590
And then what?

1837
01:19:50,630 --> 01:19:51,410
Left again, right?

1838
01:19:51,790 --> 01:19:53,750
It's left and then left again.

1839
01:19:54,250 --> 01:19:55,650
And then was it left again?

1840
01:19:55,710 --> 01:19:57,070
And then it was left again, right guys?

1841
01:19:57,350 --> 01:19:58,250
Okay, it was left again.

1842
01:19:58,330 --> 01:19:59,570
Why is she so fast?

1843
01:20:00,410 --> 01:20:01,690
Molly, leave me alone!

1844
01:20:03,830 --> 01:20:05,930
It's not my fault you're not popular!

1845
01:20:07,430 --> 01:20:08,630
Bro, improve yourself!

1846
01:20:12,370 --> 01:20:13,570
Oh my god.

1847
01:20:14,090 --> 01:20:16,430
It's not my fault kids don't love you!

1848
01:20:17,950 --> 01:20:18,650
Oh no.

1849
01:20:18,990 --> 01:20:19,230
Oh no.

1850
01:20:19,790 --> 01:20:20,250
Oh no.

1851
01:20:20,250 --> 01:20:20,430
Okay.

1852
01:20:20,830 --> 01:20:21,310
Nice.

1853
01:20:21,790 --> 01:20:22,270
Parkour.

1854
01:20:23,450 --> 01:20:25,270
I was never gonna make it anyway!

1855
01:20:26,510 --> 01:20:28,880
What are they?

1856
01:20:29,420 --> 01:20:29,900
Okay.

1857
01:20:30,500 --> 01:20:30,980
Alright.

1858
01:20:31,600 --> 01:20:32,080
Alright.

1859
01:20:32,100 --> 01:20:32,360
We...

1860
01:20:32,360 --> 01:20:33,860
It's forward, right?

1861
01:20:33,900 --> 01:20:34,720
The jump goes forward.

1862
01:20:34,780 --> 01:20:35,700
The jump goes forward.

1863
01:20:36,440 --> 01:20:36,920
Yes.

1864
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:37,220
Okay.

1865
01:20:37,320 --> 01:20:38,440
The jump goes forward.

1866
01:20:38,680 --> 01:20:39,160
Alright.

1867
01:20:40,160 --> 01:20:40,640
Oh.

1868
01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:42,000
Okay.

1869
01:20:42,020 --> 01:20:42,240
Up.

1870
01:20:42,400 --> 01:20:43,200
Up I go.

1871
01:20:44,240 --> 01:20:45,460
And then down I go.

1872
01:20:45,700 --> 01:20:47,160
And then we go this way.

1873
01:20:49,240 --> 01:20:50,620
And then we go that way.

1874
01:20:50,700 --> 01:20:51,120
And then we go that way.

1875
01:20:51,120 --> 01:20:51,200
And then we go that way.

1876
01:20:51,220 --> 01:20:51,700
And then we go that way.

1877
01:20:51,720 --> 01:20:52,100
Alright.

1878
01:20:52,140 --> 01:20:52,500
Nice.

1879
01:20:52,700 --> 01:20:54,820
Your merchandise just doesn't sell, Molly!

1880
01:20:55,060 --> 01:20:56,260
That's why we don't make more!

1881
01:20:58,800 --> 01:20:59,460
Oh god.

1882
01:20:59,540 --> 01:20:59,900
Oh god.

1883
01:20:59,960 --> 01:21:01,040
Please don't come up here.

1884
01:21:01,660 --> 01:21:03,020
Please don't come up here.

1885
01:21:03,900 --> 01:21:05,040
I'm still running!

1886
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:07,280
Oh god.

1887
01:21:07,380 --> 01:21:09,440
I don't like this because I can't see in front of me!

1888
01:21:09,640 --> 01:21:11,260
I can't see in front of me!

1889
01:21:12,260 --> 01:21:13,300
Oh, there you are!

1890
01:21:13,340 --> 01:21:13,880
Oh, am I safe?

1891
01:21:13,940 --> 01:21:14,340
Am I safe?

1892
01:21:14,880 --> 01:21:15,620
Wait, hold on!

1893
01:21:15,800 --> 01:21:16,960
This room's staff only!

1894
01:21:17,500 --> 01:21:18,180
I'm staff!

1895
01:21:18,240 --> 01:21:18,620
I'm staff!

1896
01:21:18,680 --> 01:21:19,160
I have...

1897
01:21:19,160 --> 01:21:19,720
I have no friends!

1898
01:21:19,820 --> 01:21:20,000
My...

1899
01:21:25,960 --> 01:21:26,060
What?

1900
01:21:26,060 --> 01:21:26,080
Okay, right?

1901
01:21:26,080 --> 01:21:26,480
It closed.

1902
01:21:26,600 --> 01:21:26,960
Oh okay.

1903
01:21:27,020 --> 01:21:27,300
Nice.

1904
01:21:27,360 --> 01:21:27,660
WTF?

1905
01:21:28,820 --> 01:21:30,460
Bro, it's not an animatronic?

1906
01:21:36,210 --> 01:21:36,990
Holy shit.

1907
01:21:37,030 --> 01:21:37,530
He's real.

1908
01:21:38,710 --> 01:21:39,170
Oh my god.

1909
01:21:39,190 --> 01:21:39,450
There's blood!

1910
01:21:47,290 --> 01:21:48,630
Why is it fleshy?

1911
01:21:49,010 --> 01:21:50,530
I thought they were supposed to be animatronics!

1912
01:21:50,750 --> 01:21:50,930
Okay.

1913
01:21:59,190 --> 01:21:59,990
They're real?

1914
01:22:11,830 --> 01:22:14,590
Remley, there's a dead fucking bird on my floor!

1915
01:22:17,530 --> 01:22:19,530
Yeah, I'm having so much fun.

1916
01:22:33,430 --> 01:22:34,550
Sure.

1917
01:22:35,510 --> 01:22:36,630
Yeah.

1918
01:22:44,890 --> 01:22:47,590
Ooh, I don't know.

1919
01:22:47,670 --> 01:22:48,890
Working with an AI?

1920
01:22:49,790 --> 01:22:52,810
Terminator taught me that I shouldn't be doing that.

1921
01:23:03,630 --> 01:23:05,070
Oh, okay.

1922
01:23:06,410 --> 01:23:08,490
Do I just...

1923
01:23:14,110 --> 01:23:14,830
Whoa!

1924
01:23:14,830 --> 01:23:16,210
Guys, you hear that?

1925
01:23:16,450 --> 01:23:17,990
The trademark expired!

1926
01:23:19,530 --> 01:23:24,450
That means we can take it and make... It's like the Mickey Mouse really boat.

1927
01:23:24,630 --> 01:23:25,230
Scene boat.

1928
01:23:26,070 --> 01:23:27,670
We can make our own content!

1929
01:23:28,950 --> 01:23:30,450
Our own Remley content!

1930
01:23:32,370 --> 01:23:33,310
We go here?

1931
01:23:33,590 --> 01:23:34,270
Wranglers only?

1932
01:23:34,450 --> 01:23:35,110
I'm a Wrangler.

1933
01:23:37,930 --> 01:23:39,190
It's public domain!

1934
01:23:39,570 --> 01:23:42,770
Well, technically not public domain, but it doesn't have a trademark.

1935
01:23:45,850 --> 01:23:48,070
Is there any freaky dolls outside?

1936
01:23:48,450 --> 01:23:48,670
No.

1937
01:23:48,670 --> 01:23:50,530
Yeah, every ball of security seems fine.

1938
01:23:52,010 --> 01:23:54,030
Let's make a Remley horror film!

1939
01:23:56,450 --> 01:24:01,510
That's what people do when a fucking trademark goes expired or things go public domain.

1940
01:24:02,850 --> 01:24:04,610
People just make horror films.

1941
01:24:04,910 --> 01:24:06,110
Because it's the cheapest.

1942
01:24:08,350 --> 01:24:09,550
Alright, let's head up.

1943
01:24:10,910 --> 01:24:11,550
Yay!

1944
01:24:13,650 --> 01:24:14,850
We made it!

1945
01:24:14,950 --> 01:24:15,430
We survived!

1946
01:24:16,950 --> 01:24:18,390
We survived, guys!

1947
01:24:19,470 --> 01:24:20,270
So easy!

1948
01:24:21,650 --> 01:24:22,690
Oh, who's this?

1949
01:24:22,810 --> 01:24:23,230
Who's Pluto?

1950
01:24:23,330 --> 01:24:23,930
Oh, it's the Pluto!

1951
01:24:26,250 --> 01:24:28,810
Wait, she doesn't seem to be an Indigo plush.

1952
01:24:29,530 --> 01:24:30,970
Oh, it was in Lost and Found.

1953
01:24:40,330 --> 01:24:41,370
Damn, Remley!

1954
01:24:41,470 --> 01:24:42,570
That's fucked up!

1955
01:24:43,830 --> 01:24:45,410
At least that Pluto might just be a toy.

1956
01:24:45,410 --> 01:24:46,410
We still have a franchise.

1957
01:24:48,770 --> 01:24:50,110
Alright, thank you for the super chat.

1958
01:24:50,190 --> 01:24:50,810
Thank you!

1959
01:24:51,030 --> 01:24:54,470
Fun fact, ball pits and playground city castles used to exist.

1960
01:24:54,770 --> 01:24:56,210
Wonder why they all disappeared?

1961
01:24:56,870 --> 01:24:57,390
Germs.

1962
01:24:57,390 --> 01:24:57,810
Covid.

1963
01:25:00,830 --> 01:25:01,610
Oceanic Odyssey?

1964
01:25:03,150 --> 01:25:04,350
I did it!

1965
01:25:08,140 --> 01:25:08,980
I did it.

1966
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:13,760
Go in?

1967
01:25:18,530 --> 01:25:19,130
There's nobody here.

1968
01:25:22,920 --> 01:25:23,840
Can I go in?

1969
01:25:26,020 --> 01:25:27,660
There's a lot of loading screens.

1970
01:25:27,880 --> 01:25:28,440
Not gonna lie.

1971
01:25:28,800 --> 01:25:29,580
Is that it?

1972
01:25:46,840 --> 01:25:49,800
Oh, it has its own song!

1973
01:25:50,180 --> 01:25:52,720
Bum bum ba ba.

1974
01:26:05,820 --> 01:26:06,400
No!

1975
01:26:10,360 --> 01:26:11,420
No!

1976
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:12,160
No!

1977
01:26:20,180 --> 01:26:30,120
At Indigo Park, there is a stark contrast to everything I know this place should be.

1978
01:26:30,680 --> 01:26:40,140
But out of the dark, you've given a spark of sunshine to this kingdom's faithful devotee.

1979
01:26:40,800 --> 01:26:46,560
At Indigo Park, more than my remarks are mysteries.

1980
01:26:46,840 --> 01:26:50,020
Even I don't know what we might find.

1981
01:26:51,340 --> 01:26:53,020
But fight for the dark.

1982
01:26:53,900 --> 01:27:00,200
And I'll be your spark of sunshine to get you out of any bind.

1983
01:27:01,160 --> 01:27:03,600
That is, if you want to keep going.

1984
01:27:03,980 --> 01:27:04,700
Oh, idea!

1985
01:27:05,040 --> 01:27:07,240
I know all of this isn't fair to you.

1986
01:27:07,400 --> 01:27:09,000
It's an awful lot to ask.

1987
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:10,260
This song is nice though.

1988
01:27:10,440 --> 01:27:13,300
It's a really nice, like, song in general.

1989
01:27:13,640 --> 01:27:14,520
Yeah, that was it!

1990
01:27:14,740 --> 01:27:16,080
I heard it was like a really short game.

1991
01:27:16,140 --> 01:27:17,120
Like, because it's chapter one.

1992
01:27:17,660 --> 01:27:19,580
I mean, it's free, by the way.

1993
01:27:19,640 --> 01:27:20,000
This game is free.

1994
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:29,380
Which is better than, like, you know, other mascot horror games that make you buy each chapter, including chapter one.

1995
01:27:29,660 --> 01:27:32,240
So, like, you know, I'm glad it's free.

1996
01:27:36,080 --> 01:27:36,600
Yeah.

1997
01:27:37,060 --> 01:27:38,380
For free games?

1998
01:27:38,640 --> 01:27:41,280
You have to buy chapter one of Garden of Bon Bon, chat.

1999
01:27:45,240 --> 01:27:49,980
I'm pretty sure, like, chapter one's free and then it hooks you in for, like, a couple of weeks.

2000
01:27:49,980 --> 01:27:52,340
For people who like mascot horror genres.

2001
01:27:55,760 --> 01:27:58,040
And, like, um...

2002
01:27:58,820 --> 01:28:00,680
And then they make you buy chapter two.

2003
01:28:02,160 --> 01:28:03,680
Yoki cover when koala.

2004
01:28:03,720 --> 01:28:04,560
Thank you for the super chat.

2005
01:28:04,640 --> 01:28:04,940
Thank you.

2006
01:28:05,140 --> 01:28:05,420
Thank you.

2007
01:28:05,940 --> 01:28:06,960
It's actually surprising.

2008
01:28:07,300 --> 01:28:08,700
When I uploaded the...

2009
01:28:08,700 --> 01:28:10,140
When I uploaded the short...

2010
01:28:10,140 --> 01:28:11,140
Sorry, shark.

2011
01:28:11,380 --> 01:28:16,360
The short for a friend like me, people didn't realize I sang that in karaoke.

2012
01:28:16,840 --> 01:28:17,980
So, people were like...

2013
01:28:18,820 --> 01:28:19,960
People were like, oh, I'm sorry.

2014
01:28:19,980 --> 01:28:20,460
Oh, my god!

2015
01:28:20,720 --> 01:28:22,040
Upload the full song!

2016
01:28:22,520 --> 01:28:24,080
When did you sing this?

2017
01:28:24,280 --> 01:28:24,780
I'm like...

2018
01:28:25,680 --> 01:28:27,040
Two months ago?

2019
01:28:30,820 --> 01:28:33,080
I was just like...

2020
01:28:33,940 --> 01:28:34,620
What?

2021
01:28:34,700 --> 01:28:36,240
Two months ago?

2022
01:28:36,880 --> 01:28:42,780
I was just like, what you mean?

2023
01:28:43,080 --> 01:28:45,560
Like, upload the full cover.

2024
01:28:46,240 --> 01:28:49,020
I'm saying that like a long time ago.

2025
01:28:50,240 --> 01:28:51,640
It's still there!

2026
01:28:51,940 --> 01:28:53,420
It's still there!

2027
01:28:53,940 --> 01:28:54,880
I mean, that was enjoyable.

2028
01:28:55,280 --> 01:28:57,340
I mean, it is a full passion project.

2029
01:28:58,280 --> 01:29:01,280
I mean, like... I'm gonna say it...

2030
01:29:01,700 --> 01:29:04,580
It follows the mascot horror game formula.

2031
01:29:04,700 --> 01:29:09,060
So if you like mascot horror game, you'll like Indigo Park.

2032
01:29:09,680 --> 01:29:12,800
It's very... it works!

2033
01:29:13,200 --> 01:29:14,080
The formula works!

2034
01:29:14,380 --> 01:29:16,780
People make like 5 million theories already!

2035
01:29:17,200 --> 01:29:20,880
I swear if I like YouTube like...

2036
01:29:22,340 --> 01:29:28,260
If I YouTube like Indigo Park theories, there's gonna be like 5 million theories already.

2037
01:29:28,540 --> 01:29:35,020
But like I feel like it works so... so like that's why like these types of genres is like really popular.

2038
01:29:35,340 --> 01:29:37,360
And like clearly Indigo Park is like...

2039
01:29:37,360 --> 01:29:39,720
It's a genre that works really well.

2040
01:29:39,760 --> 01:29:44,840
Like it follows the mascot horror genre and it works very well in that aspect.

2041
01:29:45,440 --> 01:29:46,360
Oh shit!

2042
01:29:46,460 --> 01:29:47,520
It's the devs in my chat!

2043
01:29:47,820 --> 01:29:52,860
Main writer, voice actor of Lloyd and Isaac, and composer of half the songs including the Rambly review.

2044
01:29:53,120 --> 01:29:55,140
Hope you enjoy the first chapter and thanks for playing!

2045
01:29:55,320 --> 01:29:55,880
Thank you!

2046
01:29:55,900 --> 01:29:56,880
Thank you for coming over!

2047
01:29:57,340 --> 01:29:58,480
So watch my playthrough!

2048
01:29:59,280 --> 01:30:00,260
Oh my god, bro!

2049
01:30:00,760 --> 01:30:04,340
Bro, Lloyd fucking... I'm sorry for calling Lloyd a little bitch.

2050
01:30:04,540 --> 01:30:07,520
And then he like made my PC blue screen after I said that.

2051
01:30:07,580 --> 01:30:07,960
I'm sorry.

2052
01:30:12,990 --> 01:30:14,590
Now I'm a Lloyd fan.

2053
01:30:19,050 --> 01:30:21,770
Thanks for coming over!

2054
01:30:21,870 --> 01:30:23,130
I don't know if you saw that part.

2055
01:30:23,530 --> 01:30:25,090
I didn't mean it.

2056
01:30:26,310 --> 01:30:27,750
Lloyd's my Oshii now.

2057
01:30:28,090 --> 01:30:30,730
Lloyd's my favorite character in Indigo Park.

2058
01:30:35,590 --> 01:30:38,090
He put me in his place.

2059
01:30:38,130 --> 01:30:39,050
He put me in his place.

2060
01:30:42,830 --> 01:30:44,750
But like yeah, it's a free game.

2061
01:30:45,330 --> 01:30:46,670
And um...

2062
01:30:46,690 --> 01:30:48,290
It clearly sets up a lot of like...

2063
01:30:48,290 --> 01:30:50,650
Like the story building and everything.

2064
01:30:51,110 --> 01:30:52,270
And like...

2065
01:30:52,270 --> 01:30:52,950
They're real.

2066
01:30:53,250 --> 01:30:55,390
I think they're real!

2067
01:30:55,530 --> 01:30:58,930
When Molly's head came off and there's blood everywhere.

2068
01:30:59,450 --> 01:31:01,250
That seems so real.

2069
01:31:01,470 --> 01:31:03,550
I think they're real creatures, guys.

2070
01:31:10,410 --> 01:31:12,790
But yeah, you can check it out.

2071
01:31:12,810 --> 01:31:13,350
It's for free.

2072
01:31:14,450 --> 01:31:16,210
It is like episodic.

2073
01:31:16,690 --> 01:31:18,550
So like I don't think I'll be...

2074
01:31:18,550 --> 01:31:19,690
I don't know if I want to play it.

2075
01:31:19,790 --> 01:31:20,310
I don't know.

2076
01:31:20,350 --> 01:31:22,710
Maybe I'll play chapter 2 when it comes out.

2077
01:31:22,790 --> 01:31:23,850
Just for like FOMO.

2078
01:31:24,030 --> 01:31:26,650
You know, like everybody will be playing chapter 2.

2079
01:31:26,830 --> 01:31:30,970
So then I might as well experience chapter 2 with all of you guys when it comes out.

2080
01:31:31,030 --> 01:31:31,390
So yeah!

2081
01:31:31,850 --> 01:31:32,710
It's a free game.

2082
01:31:32,870 --> 01:31:33,870
So like it doesn't hurt.

2083
01:31:35,790 --> 01:31:40,870
And I assume that chapter 2 and the rest will be paid.

2084
01:31:41,250 --> 01:31:44,530
Just because like that's usually how it goes when it comes to mascot horror games.

2085
01:31:45,330 --> 01:31:46,010
But yeah.

2086
01:31:46,750 --> 01:31:50,150
Let me go back to my chatting screen.

2087
01:31:51,090 --> 01:31:52,410
I enjoyed it so far.

2088
01:31:53,670 --> 01:31:54,630
The lore building.

2089
01:31:54,830 --> 01:31:56,910
Because it's the usual type of...

2090
01:31:58,710 --> 01:32:00,450
It's there to like hook you in.

2091
01:32:00,590 --> 01:32:04,570
And to be like, ooh what's going to happen next in Indigo Park?

2092
01:32:04,830 --> 01:32:06,590
How did the park get abandoned?

2093
01:32:07,010 --> 01:32:08,990
Why is that a real lion?

2094
01:32:12,010 --> 01:32:15,630
Why is there a real lion in there?

2095
01:32:16,050 --> 01:32:17,950
And not a fake lion.

2096
01:32:18,330 --> 01:32:20,930
Where did the real lion come from?

2097
01:32:24,030 --> 01:32:25,510
There was an arcade.

2098
01:32:25,710 --> 01:32:26,430
Oh my god.

2099
01:32:26,450 --> 01:32:27,650
I missed a lot of stuff.

2100
01:32:28,030 --> 01:32:31,770
I didn't even realize there was an arcade in there.

2101
01:32:31,930 --> 01:32:36,130
Apparently I missed a scene where something was supposed to happen.

2102
01:32:36,490 --> 01:32:38,350
And I wasn't looking at it.

2103
01:32:38,430 --> 01:32:38,970
That's a little bit of a shame.

2104
01:32:38,990 --> 01:32:39,750
That happens a lot.

2105
01:32:42,650 --> 01:32:43,530
Final next.

2106
01:32:43,790 --> 01:32:45,530
Okay, Indigo Park.

2107
01:32:46,430 --> 01:32:47,210
What's his name?

2108
01:32:47,310 --> 01:32:48,110
The Eeyore Dragon?

2109
01:32:48,930 --> 01:32:51,130
What was the Eeyore Dragon's name?

2110
01:32:56,530 --> 01:32:57,810
Eeyore... what was his name again?

2111
01:32:58,030 --> 01:33:00,290
I just remember him as Eeyore Dragon.

2112
01:33:00,630 --> 01:33:01,710
I know Molly's name.

2113
01:33:02,790 --> 01:33:03,670
Oh, Finley.

2114
01:33:03,790 --> 01:33:04,610
Okay, Finley.

2115
01:33:05,490 --> 01:33:05,930
Ending.

2116
01:33:05,950 --> 01:33:07,350
Alright guys, I'm going to watch it.

2117
01:33:12,390 --> 01:33:15,430
I'm going to steal the content.

2118
01:33:18,150 --> 01:33:18,730
I'm going to steal the content.

2119
01:33:18,730 --> 01:33:20,250
Where is he?

2120
01:33:20,590 --> 01:33:21,990
He's like here, right?

2121
01:33:22,410 --> 01:33:22,990
Alright.

2122
01:33:25,790 --> 01:33:26,770
Here you go.

2123
01:33:27,170 --> 01:33:28,510
I'm looking at the ending.

2124
01:33:30,290 --> 01:33:30,870
Alright.

2125
01:33:33,410 --> 01:33:34,690
Oh, there he is!

2126
01:33:34,890 --> 01:33:36,230
Why didn't I see that?

2127
01:33:36,710 --> 01:33:37,770
Bro, he just... okay.

2128
01:33:38,990 --> 01:33:39,630
Is that the jump scare?

2129
01:33:41,030 --> 01:33:42,850
He just flies over.

2130
01:33:46,190 --> 01:33:49,830
He just fucking swims over.

2131
01:33:50,450 --> 01:33:50,970
God.

2132
01:33:52,150 --> 01:33:54,910
I didn't realize that was the jump scare.

2133
01:33:56,310 --> 01:33:56,830
I didn't realize that was the jump scare.

2134
01:33:59,070 --> 01:34:01,250
Alright, so that was the jump scare.

2135
01:34:01,430 --> 01:34:03,050
I thought there was like other...

2136
01:34:03,050 --> 01:34:04,630
I thought he was going to do something.

2137
01:34:05,170 --> 01:34:06,310
Well, that's nice to know.

2138
01:34:06,930 --> 01:34:07,970
That's nice to know.

2139
01:34:08,050 --> 01:34:08,650
Oh, there's the arcade.

2140
01:34:08,990 --> 01:34:13,220
Oh, if you beat the arcade game, things go freaking crazy.

2141
01:34:15,170 --> 01:34:18,890
The Arcade Machine Rambly Rush is where most of the rest of my music was.

2142
01:34:19,050 --> 01:34:23,470
There's also a fully animated official music video of the Kredits theme on my channel.

2143
01:34:23,750 --> 01:34:24,530
Oh, shit!

2144
01:34:25,390 --> 01:34:26,530
There's a fully...

2145
01:34:26,530 --> 01:34:27,170
Oh, nice!

2146
01:34:27,310 --> 01:34:28,630
The music was really good.

2147
01:34:28,830 --> 01:34:30,250
I really enjoyed the music.

2148
01:34:32,030 --> 01:34:33,390
I see it.

2149
01:34:33,470 --> 01:34:34,430
Here's the music.

2150
01:34:37,090 --> 01:34:37,630
Yeah.

2151
01:34:37,630 --> 01:34:37,870
There you go.

2152
01:34:39,890 --> 01:34:42,170
If anyone wants to check out the full music...

2153
01:34:42,170 --> 01:34:43,310
But yeah, thanks for dropping by.

2154
01:34:43,610 --> 01:34:44,530
Thanks for dropping by.

2155
01:34:44,590 --> 01:34:47,330
I'm glad to be able to play your game, sir.

2156
01:34:47,910 --> 01:34:48,690
Oh, best.

2157
01:34:48,950 --> 01:34:50,550
Alright, super chat reading time.

2158
01:34:50,630 --> 01:34:51,130
Guys, okay.

2159
01:34:51,390 --> 01:34:51,870
Alright.

2160
01:34:52,230 --> 01:34:55,330
I promise you guys this today.

2161
01:34:55,970 --> 01:34:57,970
I will set up my PC.

2162
01:34:58,370 --> 01:35:00,390
Like, I'm not gaslighting this time.

2163
01:35:01,850 --> 01:35:03,850
Because I'm 70% done.

2164
01:35:06,730 --> 01:35:07,730
If tomorrow...

2165
01:35:07,730 --> 01:35:09,190
If tomorrow...

2166
01:35:09,620 --> 01:35:13,890
The PC is not set up by tomorrow's Sandland stream...

2167
01:35:13,890 --> 01:35:17,670
You get to request anything as a group from me.

2168
01:35:17,790 --> 01:35:18,450
One thing.

2169
01:35:18,730 --> 01:35:21,430
You get to request anything...

2170
01:35:22,530 --> 01:35:23,770
As a group, though.

2171
01:35:23,830 --> 01:35:25,330
You guys have to agree as a group, though.

2172
01:35:26,650 --> 01:35:29,950
You have to agree together as a hive mind what you want.

2173
01:35:32,390 --> 01:35:33,830
I didn't think it was super easy.

2174
01:35:33,850 --> 01:35:34,050
Thank you, chat.

2175
01:35:34,070 --> 01:35:35,090
Thank you.

2176
01:35:38,950 --> 01:35:40,950
But I will...

2177
01:35:40,950 --> 01:35:43,710
I will set up...

2178
01:35:43,710 --> 01:35:45,850
the PC by tomorrow.

2179
01:35:46,150 --> 01:35:48,170
Before the Sandland stream.

2180
01:35:48,490 --> 01:35:50,470
So we'll finally be free.

2181
01:35:56,700 --> 01:35:57,940
We'll finally...

2182
01:35:57,940 --> 01:36:00,600
Visage was already gonna be played anyway, chat.

2183
01:36:01,040 --> 01:36:02,640
It was already gonna be played.

2184
01:36:02,680 --> 01:36:03,560
We reached the goal.

2185
01:36:04,100 --> 01:36:04,900
Did we?

2186
01:36:05,040 --> 01:36:05,640
Yeah, we did.

2187
01:36:05,680 --> 01:36:06,260
We reached the goal.

2188
01:36:06,280 --> 01:36:06,960
We reached the charity goal.

2189
01:36:07,560 --> 01:36:08,500
So, like...

2190
01:36:08,500 --> 01:36:09,900
Look, see, I'm so generous.

2191
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:10,660
I could have lied.

2192
01:36:10,920 --> 01:36:13,980
I could have lied and was like, Oh, I don't know about Visage.

2193
01:36:17,540 --> 01:36:17,980
Alright.

2194
01:36:18,300 --> 01:36:18,740
Well...

2195
01:36:19,500 --> 01:36:22,400
Guys, I like how you're all coming up with ideas now.

2196
01:36:22,740 --> 01:36:25,420
Not believing that I'm gonna set up my PC.

2197
01:36:25,600 --> 01:36:27,780
I am going to set up my PC!

2198
01:36:28,220 --> 01:36:29,380
By tomorrow!

2199
01:36:29,920 --> 01:36:30,880
So you guys...

2200
01:36:30,880 --> 01:36:33,460
So don't even need to think about it.

2201
01:36:33,520 --> 01:36:35,520
You guys don't even need to think about...

2202
01:36:35,520 --> 01:36:36,260
Like, the podcast.

2203
01:36:36,280 --> 01:36:36,860
Like, the punishment.

2204
01:36:38,600 --> 01:36:40,540
Cause it's gonna be done.

2205
01:36:41,160 --> 01:36:41,600
Chat.

2206
01:36:42,340 --> 01:36:43,280
That's the thing.

2207
01:36:44,980 --> 01:36:48,440
If you're thinking about it now, it's a waste of your time.

2208
01:36:52,360 --> 01:36:54,260
Kaz, another Doki karaoke.

2209
01:36:54,620 --> 01:36:55,580
Thank you for the super chat.

2210
01:36:55,640 --> 01:36:56,660
Thank you, thank you.

2211
01:36:56,820 --> 01:36:58,020
Duck, thank you for the super chat.

2212
01:36:58,100 --> 01:36:59,340
We heard that one.

2213
01:36:59,420 --> 01:37:00,160
But this time!

2214
01:37:00,440 --> 01:37:02,980
Look, because blue screen is a little bit too much.

2215
01:37:02,980 --> 01:37:06,860
If like the game crashes like once every once in a while, that's fine.

2216
01:37:07,120 --> 01:37:09,100
But the blue screen is sort of the...

2217
01:37:09,820 --> 01:37:13,060
The blue screen is where I have to draw the line.

2218
01:37:15,840 --> 01:37:20,160
That's when I know that my PC is literally begging.

2219
01:37:20,740 --> 01:37:24,640
It is like crawling itself to the grave right now.

2220
01:37:24,800 --> 01:37:28,460
My PC is literally just crawling to its coffin.

2221
01:37:28,700 --> 01:37:30,020
And like, please bury me.

2222
01:37:30,120 --> 01:37:31,540
Please, I beg of you.

2223
01:37:31,600 --> 01:37:32,580
I am blue screening.

2224
01:37:32,980 --> 01:37:33,620
Bury me.

2225
01:37:33,700 --> 01:37:34,840
Leave me to die.

2226
01:37:37,620 --> 01:37:39,620
Like, that's when I know...

2227
01:37:40,500 --> 01:37:41,840
That I have to...

2228
01:37:41,840 --> 01:37:44,360
I have to let it rest in peace for real.

2229
01:37:45,340 --> 01:37:46,820
Zero, thank you for the super chat.

2230
01:37:46,880 --> 01:37:47,880
Thank you, thank you.

2231
01:37:48,060 --> 01:37:49,220
Eldering and Visage.

2232
01:37:50,440 --> 01:37:51,860
Cosmic, thank you for the super chat.

2233
01:37:51,920 --> 01:37:52,640
Thank you, thank you.

2234
01:37:52,660 --> 01:37:53,500
It's been weeks, Doki.

2235
01:37:53,600 --> 01:37:55,000
Look, that's what I'm saying!

2236
01:37:55,600 --> 01:38:02,420
I am finally going to make sure my PC is finally left to rest.

2237
01:38:02,580 --> 01:38:02,960
I am finally going to make sure my PC is finally left to rest.

2238
01:38:02,980 --> 01:38:06,700
Because it's literally at its dying knees right now.

2239
01:38:07,100 --> 01:38:08,480
Wanting me to put...

2240
01:38:08,480 --> 01:38:09,700
You know like that...

2241
01:38:10,780 --> 01:38:11,920
There's a hole in front.

2242
01:38:11,980 --> 01:38:13,560
The PC dug its own hole.

2243
01:38:14,060 --> 01:38:15,580
Gave me a pistol.

2244
01:38:15,800 --> 01:38:18,420
And was like, please, just end it.

2245
01:38:24,740 --> 01:38:27,860
The blue screen was a sign.

2246
01:38:28,040 --> 01:38:30,620
It's never blue screened before.

2247
01:38:30,800 --> 01:38:33,540
When all the problems were having...

2248
01:38:33,540 --> 01:38:35,780
When we were having all these problems.

2249
01:38:36,180 --> 01:38:39,420
But now that it's starting to blue screen...

2250
01:38:39,420 --> 01:38:40,860
It is time...

2251
01:38:41,840 --> 01:38:43,780
To lay it to rest.

2252
01:38:44,520 --> 01:38:45,500
To lay it to rest.

2253
01:38:47,780 --> 01:38:49,060
Zai, thank you for the super chat.

2254
01:38:49,100 --> 01:38:49,960
Thank you, thank you.

2255
01:38:49,960 --> 01:38:51,300
QV, thank you for the super chat.

2256
01:38:51,360 --> 01:38:52,020
Thank you, thank you.

2257
01:38:52,040 --> 01:38:54,900
Alright, best, spin the bossa reel if it isn't ready tomorrow.

2258
01:38:56,240 --> 01:38:57,200
Thank you for the super chat.

2259
01:38:57,280 --> 01:38:58,020
Thank you, thank you.

2260
01:38:58,040 --> 01:39:00,380
Guys, stop coming up with ideas!

2261
01:39:03,540 --> 01:39:04,460
What do I get?

2262
01:39:04,520 --> 01:39:06,380
When I set it up, chat.

2263
01:39:08,140 --> 01:39:08,880
What do...

2264
01:39:08,880 --> 01:39:09,900
A working PC.

2265
01:39:10,140 --> 01:39:11,320
Okay, that is true.

2266
01:39:11,620 --> 01:39:13,380
I get a working PC.

2267
01:39:13,620 --> 01:39:16,240
But also, what else do I get?

2268
01:39:22,210 --> 01:39:23,610
But there should be...

2269
01:39:23,610 --> 01:39:24,170
More!

2270
01:39:28,150 --> 01:39:29,030
Okay, guys.

2271
01:39:29,210 --> 01:39:30,210
I'm gonna call it here.

2272
01:39:30,490 --> 01:39:32,050
I had a great time hanging out with you guys.

2273
01:39:32,350 --> 01:39:33,590
We're back on YouTube!

2274
01:39:34,390 --> 01:39:34,870
Yeah!

2275
01:39:38,150 --> 01:39:38,950
Anyway, guys.

2276
01:39:38,990 --> 01:39:40,790
I'll see you guys tomorrow.

2277
01:39:41,750 --> 01:39:43,510
It was a short stream today.

2278
01:39:43,690 --> 01:39:45,730
But it's more like an appetizer today.

2279
01:39:45,890 --> 01:39:49,110
Because we do have a sort of long week filled with lots of streams.

2280
01:39:49,750 --> 01:39:50,550
This week.

2281
01:39:50,810 --> 01:39:51,690
So, uh...

2282
01:39:51,690 --> 01:39:56,150
If you don't set tomorrow, you have to eat more hot sauce.

2283
01:39:56,270 --> 01:39:56,930
Thank you for the super chat.

2284
01:39:57,690 --> 01:39:58,530
Joke's on you!

2285
01:39:58,610 --> 01:39:59,870
I like hot sauce!

2286
01:40:00,550 --> 01:40:01,450
I'm Asian!

2287
01:40:03,150 --> 01:40:04,910
We can handle the sauce!

2288
01:40:05,530 --> 01:40:06,370
Anyway, guys.

2289
01:40:06,370 --> 01:40:07,590
It might be a short stream today.

2290
01:40:07,910 --> 01:40:12,330
But like I said, it's sort of like a little appetizer for the long week of solo streams.

2291
01:40:12,750 --> 01:40:15,090
I had a great time just talking with you guys again.

2292
01:40:15,310 --> 01:40:17,970
Just like to the dragoons mostly.

2293
01:40:18,610 --> 01:40:19,490
So, like, collab.

2294
01:40:19,670 --> 01:40:22,310
It's a great time to just have dragoon time with you guys.

2295
01:40:23,570 --> 01:40:24,170
But, yes.

2296
01:40:24,310 --> 01:40:27,530
I'm gonna finish saving some...

2297
01:40:27,530 --> 01:40:29,970
Migrating my files and everything to the new PC.

2298
01:40:30,250 --> 01:40:30,870
So I'll...

2299
01:40:31,630 --> 01:40:34,050
I fucking felt like I had a stroke there.

2300
01:40:34,130 --> 01:40:34,890
Like, I couldn't...

2301
01:40:34,890 --> 01:40:35,550
I couldn't verbalize.

2302
01:40:35,550 --> 01:40:38,230
My words were just tangled up.

2303
01:40:40,310 --> 01:40:40,670
Anyway.

2304
01:40:41,970 --> 01:40:43,310
I'm gonna go head off now.

2305
01:40:43,370 --> 01:40:45,250
As always, everybody stay hydrated.

2306
01:40:45,530 --> 01:40:46,030
Posture check.

2307
01:40:46,110 --> 01:40:47,930
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

2308
01:40:48,050 --> 01:40:49,890
And if you stayed up for me, head to bed.

2309
01:40:50,010 --> 01:40:51,150
Cause you deserve it.

2310
01:40:51,230 --> 01:40:52,250
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

2311
01:40:52,670 --> 01:40:53,370
Bye, guys.

2312
01:40:53,830 --> 01:40:54,190
Bye!
