1
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,000
Hello, everybody!

2
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,460
I'm sorry I'm a little late.

3
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,880
I literally... I went outside.

4
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:58,080
How could I do this to you guys?

5
00:01:58,180 --> 00:01:59,180
I touched grass!

6
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:03,420
Sorry, I went out... I touched some grass today, so...

7
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:11,080
I've been touching grass a lot, guys, and I literally just got back, like, five minutes ago.

8
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:19,400
Like, 2.05, I got back, and I was like, and I was like, turning everything on, getting everything done.

9
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:22,080
I was like, oh my gosh, did they post a code yet?

10
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,140
Oh, thank God they didn't.

11
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,600
Okay, so we're good to go.

12
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,120
We're okay.

13
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:29,660
I haven't even... guys, I haven't even eaten lunch yet.

14
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:36,800
I touched grass, but I didn't even eat yet.

15
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:38,460
It's okay, I can survive.

16
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,340
I have... I have lots of snacks.

17
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:42,840
I have some snacks in my room for emergency.

18
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:46,020
Moments like this, so it'll be okay, guys.

19
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,200
Sorry, I've been... we're busy.

20
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:49,400
Well, not busy.

21
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:51,640
I've been sleeping and touching grass.

22
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:58,640
I've been going outside and doing stuff.

23
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:02,200
Um, but we are at day two!

24
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:08,060
Give it up for day two of Fortnite Twitch Rivals!

25
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:10,840
There's a lot of rules for day two.

26
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:12,220
Um...

27
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:12,900
Okay.

28
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:13,120
Alright.

29
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,440
There's a lot.

30
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,580
There's like two paragraphs.

31
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,820
Like, it's like two pages.

32
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:21,800
I was looking at it, and I was just like, what the...

33
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:24,820
What the fuck?

34
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:27,220
Okay, let me tell you guys what the new rules are.

35
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:34,260
So, for the second format, the second format of this tournament, it is, um...

36
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:35,840
It's complicated.

37
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:37,920
It's very complicated.

38
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:41,720
So, um, basically each game is different.

39
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:43,720
It's like a different thing.

40
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:46,780
And, um...

41
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:48,800
It has like different rules.

42
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:50,280
So, they ban certain...

43
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,500
They ban certain...

44
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:52,460
How am I gonna keep...

45
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:53,400
I barely know it

46
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:02,140
now!

47
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:03,060
Okay, anyway.

48
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,660
Um, in some of the games...

49
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:09,040
Sorry, I just found out at the same time as you guys.

50
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:09,860
Um...

51
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,480
I literally just found out.

52
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,920
Like, right now.

53
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:17,820
Anyway.

54
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:20,100
Um...

55
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:20,180
Okay.

56
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:20,520
Um...

57
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,920
Ian Todd didn't read the rules.

58
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,380
Because I'm reading it.

59
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,040
As we go along.

60
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:35,450
Sorry, out of anger, I choked.

61
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,460
Out of anger...

62
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,840
I choked on my own saliva.

63
00:04:58,930 --> 00:04:59,670
Okay, now.

64
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:00,090
Sorry.

65
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:04,230
I found out they ban certain guns for each game.

66
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:05,250
Each game is different!

67
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:07,370
Each game...

68
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:10,030
There's certain bans...

69
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:11,090
For certain guns.

70
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:12,010
Oh, God.

71
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:14,530
My throat is so fucked right now after so much anger.

72
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:20,610
Okay.

73
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:23,430
Oh, my God.

74
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:25,270
I can't believe it.

75
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:27,830
Rules fucked me up.

76
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:29,090
I fucking hate rules.

77
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:31,050
I fucking hate rules.

78
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:41,420
Alright.

79
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:42,680
Okay.

80
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:43,120
So!

81
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:45,600
Game one.

82
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,100
They have this thing called hotspots.

83
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:48,520
Hotspot landing.

84
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,720
They also have this thing called safe zone.

85
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,800
So, safe zone is off.

86
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:56,280
What do you mean by safe zone?

87
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,080
Well...

88
00:05:58,260 --> 00:05:59,300
Each game...

89
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:00,120
There's a...

90
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,300
There's a certain rule.

91
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:06,460
If safe zone is on, you cannot kill until the storm hits the second storm.

92
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,840
So, nobody is allowed to kill until it's storm two.

93
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:12,100
But, in game one...

94
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:14,340
Safe zone is off.

95
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:17,580
But what do you mean by safe zone is off?

96
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,220
Also, what the fuck is wrong with my monitor?

97
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:21,240
Like...

98
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,320
No!

99
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,060
Why is everything fucked up?

100
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:26,840
Guys, I'm...

101
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,100
It's going to look a little weird soon.

102
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:29,740
My monitor is weird.

103
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:31,220
I need to turn it on and off.

104
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:31,820
Give me a sec.

105
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,820
Everything is going to look weird for a sec.

106
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,440
Because I need to turn on my...

107
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,200
Turn my on and off my monitor.

108
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:40,140
Anyway.

109
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:42,240
So!

110
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:43,280
Okay.

111
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:44,640
Now, my monitor is not turning on.

112
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:45,960
Wait.

113
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,560
Why is my monitor not turning on?

114
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:50,820
What's going on?

115
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:53,960
Oh, thank God.

116
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:54,280
Okay.

117
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,040
Okay.

118
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,420
I was going to be really worried.

119
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,300
I was...

120
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:58,200
Oh, no.

121
00:06:58,380 --> 00:06:59,280
What's going on?

122
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:00,340
Oh, thank God.

123
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:00,520
Okay.

124
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:01,500
Everything is okay now.

125
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,380
Okay, guys.

126
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:02,820
It's okay.

127
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:03,620
Everything is okay.

128
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,020
I'm a little bit of a mess, guys.

129
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:05,720
I'm...

130
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,540
I'm a little bit of...

131
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:13,120
Is it noticeable that I'm a little bit of a mess?

132
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:13,800
Is it...

133
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,660
Is it noticeable at all?

134
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,080
Actually...

135
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:19,640
I don't know.

136
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,220
Um...

137
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:22,480
Anyway...

138
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,400
Games...

139
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,340
So, what I mean by safe zone?

140
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,620
So, like I said, the moment it hits...

141
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:29,520
The first game has no safe zone.

142
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:32,080
But it has, like, a hot drop.

143
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:35,880
So, like, if you land in this hot drop area, you get...

144
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,660
Each member gets 1 point.

145
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:40,240
But the thing is, there's no safe zone so people can kill.

146
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:43,140
So there can be, like, 30 people in this one...

147
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:45,300
In this one area.

148
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:45,940
Just for the whole game.

149
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:46,540
What are those two points?

150
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,100
So we're landing there?

151
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:54,740
So we're gonna be landing there.

152
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,940
For those two points.

153
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:01,780
Anyway, game two!

154
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,340
There's gonna be...

155
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,100
Game two?

156
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:08,660
We're allowing cars for game two.

157
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,640
Oh, it's Fortnite.

158
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,820
Fortnite's why it's fucking weird.

159
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:12,860
Oh, okay.

160
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:15,080
Fortnite's the reason why everything's flashing.

161
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,440
Oh, that's not good.

162
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,880
That's not good at all.

163
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:21,900
Why is...

164
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:25,780
Why is Fortnite flashing my monitor on and off?

165
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:27,680
Hello?

166
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,240
Fortnite?

167
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,800
Guys, I have a little problem.

168
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:34,280
Fortnite is currently flashing my game.

169
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,440
Flashing my monitor on and off.

170
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:38,620
I don't know how to fix this.

171
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:39,680
No, wait.

172
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:40,840
Is it okay?

173
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,480
Okay, it's okay now.

174
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:43,600
Alright, I...

175
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,420
Okay, I just can't tab out.

176
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,140
Okay, that's good.

177
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:47,300
Anyway...

178
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,180
Game two!

179
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:50,800
Game two?

180
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:52,480
There's gonna be cars.

181
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,460
So they're gonna allow car weapons.

182
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:57,260
So people are gonna be driving around in cars.

183
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:03,220
That's... I mean, there's a lot more to game two.

184
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:09,140
I was reading it and there's a lot more, but you're allowed to deal damage and kill with cars.

185
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,720
You can have car weapons.

186
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,040
Um...

187
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,300
There's a lot of consumables that you can use.

188
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:17,920
You can use shield breaker EMP.

189
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,040
What the fuck?

190
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:20,300
Um...

191
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:21,240
Let's see.

192
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:21,960
So there's that.

193
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,040
Game three?

194
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:24,940
Normal game.

195
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:26,980
Game three is a normal game.

196
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:27,720
Game four!

197
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,800
Safe zone is on.

198
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:34,080
So you can't deal... You can't kill anybody until the second storm.

199
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:35,820
And there's banned weapons.

200
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:37,760
There's a list of banned weapons.

201
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,780
I'm looking through them right now and I don't understand.

202
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:44,320
I barely understand, like, half... I barely understand more than two of the weapons in Fortnite.

203
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:48,060
Like, know the names of two of the weapons in Fortnite, let alone, like, all of this.

204
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,160
Um, and in game five...

205
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,580
Oh my god, there's six games.

206
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:51,880
Okay.

207
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:59,660
It's another hotspot landing where we're supposed to land on this random... this area called Brutal Beachhead.

208
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:01,280
That's the only rule.

209
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:02,280
That's the hotspot.

210
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,540
There's no safe zone.

211
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,420
And finally, the last game.

212
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:06,740
More banned weapons.

213
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:07,700
I have no...

214
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:09,080
There are new weapons too, by the way.

215
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:11,820
There's new weapons that are banned.

216
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:15,060
I still have no idea what those weapons are, but...

217
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:20,800
But, they're banned!

218
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,320
So, like, that's all the information I got.

219
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,220
Well, I should... I should have been joining a party.

220
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:26,640
Alright, nice.

221
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:30,160
Alright, so those are the new rules.

222
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:31,620
Oh my gosh, I'm not choking anymore.

223
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:32,040
Thank god.

224
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:38,410
How will I know if I have a bad weapon?

225
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:39,290
I don't know.

226
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:41,850
I'll just be like... I'll just be like, Doryu, I'm holding this weapon.

227
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:42,610
Is this banned?

228
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:44,050
That's like the only information.

229
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:49,870
If Nitro Fists are allowed, try to always get one.

230
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:50,870
I think they are.

231
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:55,030
I don't see any rules banning Nitro Fists.

232
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:55,670
That's the thing.

233
00:10:55,810 --> 00:10:56,490
Oh, another announcement.

234
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:58,070
Oh, they changed something.

235
00:10:58,850 --> 00:10:59,610
Oh wait, no.

236
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:00,530
Oh no, that's the code.

237
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:02,110
Okay, I was gonna be like, did they change something?

238
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:03,290
No, okay.

239
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:04,390
Nitro Dome.

240
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:06,830
Somebody asked if fists are allowed.

241
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:09,010
If game one and three...

242
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:11,910
Oh.

243
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:15,010
Fists are allowed, by the way.

244
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:18,070
They're only banned in game two.

245
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:19,590
So yes.

246
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:21,170
Lobby code's up.

247
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:22,670
Alright, gotta enter it for us though.

248
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:23,350
Did you...

249
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:24,530
Oh wait, am I leading?

250
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:26,030
Wait, are you leading?

251
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:26,930
No, no, you joined on me.

252
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:27,410
Oh, you're like...

253
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:28,670
Okay, I was gonna be like, oh god.

254
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:29,170
Yeah.

255
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:29,170
Okay.

256
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:30,790
Okay.

257
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:32,010
That's good to know.

258
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:33,130
Are you writing a gremlin against me?

259
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:36,970
Okay, did you see the rules where it said that fists are allowed?

260
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:39,310
Wait, fists are allowed?

261
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:39,610
Yeah.

262
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:40,510
Oh, they're gonna have the fists in?

263
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:42,410
Yeah, they said it's not banned.

264
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:44,710
Okay, okay, alright.

265
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:46,950
So like... I guess we're gonna be fisting dudes?

266
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:48,190
Oh, okay.

267
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:49,150
I feel like...

268
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:51,710
Okay, first off, we gotta survive the fucking hot drop.

269
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:55,410
Okay, we're gonna survive, hot drop, and then we're gonna fist dudes.

270
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:57,010
Okay, you're gonna fist some dudes.

271
00:11:57,090 --> 00:11:57,870
I'm just gonna watch.

272
00:11:58,990 --> 00:11:59,750
I'm just...

273
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:03,270
You're gonna turn other people into werewolves.

274
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:04,310
Hey, wait.

275
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:06,330
Fisting turns dudes into werewolves?

276
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:09,170
Did that not turn you into a werewolf?

277
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:13,590
Did that not turn you into a werewolf?

278
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:14,090
Wait, how did you know?

279
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:20,930
Who gave you those tapes?

280
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:24,710
Wait, is that how people turn into werewolves?

281
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:25,430
Is that not it?

282
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:27,290
How else is this gonna happen?

283
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:29,070
Is that not it?

284
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:29,650
How else is this gonna happen?

285
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:35,410
American Werewolf in London, the plot was all started because a dude got fisted, and then he turned into a werewolf.

286
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:36,390
Wait, is that true?

287
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:38,190
Yes.

288
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:41,390
Oh, I fucking knew it.

289
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:42,170
I knew it.

290
00:12:42,210 --> 00:12:43,890
That's why there's not a lot of werewolves around.

291
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:47,370
That's why, like, they need to bring back some fists.

292
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:49,010
Like, fisting is so, like...

293
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:50,970
Gotta repopulate the werewolf population.

294
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:52,390
Yeah.

295
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:55,030
This is why we're gonna spread the word of fisting.

296
00:12:55,130 --> 00:12:58,170
No, you're gonna spread the word of fisting.

297
00:12:58,330 --> 00:12:58,850
I'm just...

298
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:01,330
I'm just a bystander.

299
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:03,610
You're gonna be suspended.

300
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:05,430
I'm here to fucking...

301
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:08,010
I'm just a bystander here.

302
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:08,810
I just learned.

303
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:11,830
No, there is no I in team.

304
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:14,090
Only us in fisting.

305
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:16,930
Wait, is there an us in fisting?

306
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:18,570
Yeah, you know.

307
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:19,290
Wait, no, there's no you?

308
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:20,590
Where the fuck's the you?

309
00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:23,110
It's... it's fusty.

310
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:30,210
Wait, what combos can we be running today?

311
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:31,410
Combos?

312
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:31,730
Okay.

313
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:32,010
Except for this one.

314
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:33,850
Do you have a banana skin?

315
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:35,690
No, I don't, sadly.

316
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:36,790
Okay.

317
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:39,150
I do not, but I do have...

318
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:40,690
Okay, what matches with John Cena?

319
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:42,490
Because we haven't run... John Cena?

320
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:44,570
We didn't run John... did we run John Cena?

321
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:46,910
In... Not in the tournament.

322
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:49,030
No, we didn't run... Yeah, we didn't run John Cena in the tournament.

323
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:50,430
What matches with John Cena?

324
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:56,170
You have the most skins, so it's easier for you to... It's easier for you to match with me.

325
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:57,950
Should I be...

326
00:13:58,630 --> 00:13:59,510
an employee?

327
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:01,370
Wait, who would go with John Cena?

328
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:03,170
Chad, who's gonna go with John Cena?

329
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:04,070
You guys gotta help us.

330
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:07,490
Uh... Who would go with John Cena?

331
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:10,910
Hmm... I'm like...

332
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:11,630
I'm going through all these.

333
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:16,550
I see, like, John Wick, John Cena... John The John... John is a sweaty skin, though.

334
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:23,050
John Cena and John Wick.

335
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:26,150
There's a big candy cane that...

336
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:31,870
A big ca- What does that have to do with... What does that have to do with John Cena?

337
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:33,790
Wait, put John Wick on for now.

338
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:35,170
Just for Team Johns!

339
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:36,190
Team Johns!

340
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:37,450
Team Johns?

341
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:42,330
Team Johns!

342
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:43,130
Let's go!

343
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:45,330
Let's fucking go!

344
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:49,650
Wait, this is Terminator?

345
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:52,790
Yeah, but what does that have to do with John Cena?

346
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:55,770
Has Arnold Schwarzenegger ever wrestled?

347
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:57,730
I know he used to be an oiled up, buff man.

348
00:14:57,770 --> 00:14:58,390
No, he used to be like a...

349
00:14:58,390 --> 00:14:59,950
He used to be like a gym rat.

350
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:03,350
Like he would just... like he was like a gym trainer.

351
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:04,430
A bodybuilder.

352
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:06,730
Oh, okay, so he was a bodybuilder.

353
00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:07,510
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

354
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:10,070
To some degree, like John Cena is that.

355
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:10,970
But...

356
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:13,170
But he was more so of a wrestler.

357
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:15,630
Yeah, that's true, that's true.

358
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:17,450
Wait, do you not have The Rock?

359
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:20,010
Oh, that's what The Rock is?

360
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:20,990
I don't have him.

361
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:21,670
You don't have him?

362
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:23,390
Oh, that would have been perfect if we had John Cena and The Rock.

363
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:25,570
No, if I had The Rock, I would definitely run The Rock, yeah.

364
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:26,810
Yeah, that would have been perfect.

365
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:29,150
I wish you could like give skins you own.

366
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:30,390
I know, right?

367
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:31,950
Like just like a little share thing or whatever.

368
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:32,790
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

369
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:38,290
But then like, but then Fortnite would never make money because people just like gift each other the skins back to back.

370
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:39,690
Oh my god.

371
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:41,230
Today I want to use this skin.

372
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:42,350
Can you gift that to me?

373
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:45,590
You share this one and I'll share this one back?

374
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:49,610
It seems fine.

375
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:51,450
Wait, what are you gonna use for your like...

376
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:54,510
I have pom-poms so I can cheer people up.

377
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:56,710
Yeah, yeah, and I have my wrestling belt.

378
00:15:57,070 --> 00:15:58,730
My WWE champion title.

379
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:00,570
I don't think I have a wrestling belt.

380
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:02,270
Oh, I have a dumbbell I can use.

381
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:02,790
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

382
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:03,450
Get a dumbbell.

383
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:03,990
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

384
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:04,730
Yeah, get us a dumbbell.

385
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:05,750
Wait, do I...

386
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:06,950
I think that's a back-wing too?

387
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:09,610
Uh...

388
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:13,250
I forgot I can have a dog on my back.

389
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:15,170
Oh!

390
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:15,770
Oh, no!

391
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:16,530
You should have the dog!

392
00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:18,110
John Wick's dog!

393
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:18,510
Yeah!

394
00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:19,810
Oh my god!

395
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:20,830
John Wick's dog!

396
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:21,090
Yeah!

397
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:23,910
Alright, I got John Wick's dog on.

398
00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:24,690
I got his dog on.

399
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:24,850
Oh my god, yeah!

400
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:26,350
That's perfect!

401
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:28,890
Oh my god.

402
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:29,710
Have you seen it?

403
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:30,470
Have you seen it yet?

404
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:31,830
Yeah, yeah, you can pet it too!

405
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:33,070
You pet the dog!

406
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:33,990
Yeah, I fucking love that one.

407
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:35,470
I forgot I had that.

408
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:36,450
Let's go, I'm gonna motivate us.

409
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:37,810
Let's go, everybody!

410
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:39,250
We're here!

411
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:40,070
Team John!

412
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:41,950
Let's go, guys!

413
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:43,710
Let's go!

414
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:45,850
Wait, what's your glider?

415
00:16:45,930 --> 00:16:46,410
What glider are you using?

416
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:48,390
My glider is... oh, it's just the same.

417
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:48,830
Shenron.

418
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:50,550
Okay, you're using Shenron.

419
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:53,850
Yeah, I really don't have any good gliders or...

420
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:54,970
uh...

421
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:58,650
I don't have any good gliders or trails.

422
00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:01,870
I never buy gliders.

423
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:03,910
No, gliders are like...

424
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:05,410
I usually get them on the Battle Pass.

425
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:07,110
I don't think I ever really spend money on them.

426
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:09,190
I've like bought like a few.

427
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:10,870
Yeah, I don't buy Battle Pass, I just...

428
00:17:10,870 --> 00:17:13,110
I never buy Battle Pass.

429
00:17:15,090 --> 00:17:16,870
Wait, oh my god, did my game crash?

430
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:19,550
Did my game crash because I looked at the Battle Pass?

431
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:20,550
Are you...

432
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:25,080
Yeah, it's frozen because I looked at it!

433
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,140
Oh shit!

434
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:26,900
No!

435
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:30,040
I'm missing one team.

436
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:32,040
No, no, I can't believe it!

437
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:33,420
It crashed because I looked...

438
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:34,620
That's the sign.

439
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:36,500
That's the sign where it's like...

440
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:39,640
You literally can't tap into anything else!

441
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:41,340
Wait, I can cancel Q.

442
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:41,840
I can cancel.

443
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:42,840
Okay, okay, okay.

444
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:48,180
Oh my god, it literally crashed because of the Battle Pass!

445
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:50,780
What are the chances?

446
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,380
I need to get Task Manager out!

447
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,680
Danny, are you trying to play with your Johns?

448
00:17:59,260 --> 00:17:59,940
Oh my god!

449
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:03,420
What the fuck?

450
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,900
Oh, wait, the rock was a Battle Pass skin?

451
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:10,880
I don't remember.

452
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:13,040
Oh my god, oh my god.

453
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:15,340
That took like forever to fucking close.

454
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:16,520
That's actually okay.

455
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:20,060
I'm gonna fucking put my Task Manager on the side just in case.

456
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:22,240
Okay, today's a mess.

457
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:24,980
It's okay, I'm a mess too.

458
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:26,640
Today's a mess right now.

459
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,520
Okay, welcome back to normal people hours.

460
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,400
What's wrong with me?

461
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:30,340
I hear you.

462
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:34,780
I saw you played more Fortnite right after.

463
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:38,240
I actually played so much Fortnite last night.

464
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:40,860
Yeah, you actually practiced.

465
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:43,380
Me practice?

466
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:45,480
Oh my god, you actually practiced.

467
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:47,480
I know my place in this tournament.

468
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:49,860
I know my place too.

469
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,120
Everyone's like, you know the lobby's stacked?

470
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,260
I'm like, yeah, we felt it was stacked yesterday.

471
00:18:54,740 --> 00:19:00,060
Yeah, I was like, cause I was like asking Twitch, I was like, are there teams that are like me?

472
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:01,880
And there's like, yeah, yeah, there are.

473
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:05,000
There's like, and then he listed like four teams.

474
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:05,980
I was like, oh, okay.

475
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,240
Those, okay.

476
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,980
I didn't realize there was like more than, you know, I was like, oh yeah, okay.

477
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:14,060
Four teams that are just like me, okay.

478
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:17,540
But then like, I don't think they were like me.

479
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,220
We are the one and only.

480
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,600
No one else can be like us.

481
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:26,160
I don't think they were like me.

482
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:31,500
Are we the only VTubers in the whole tournament?

483
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:32,280
I think so.

484
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:33,080
I think so.

485
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:34,520
I think all the other VTubers said no.

486
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:42,260
The other VTubers are like, I don't know man.

487
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:48,040
Do I wanna get like absolutely demolished by like Fortnite players?

488
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:55,200
And I, obviously I I have no sense of self-worth, so I was like, yeah, let's do it.

489
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:02,500
You hit up the right person to fill last minute.

490
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:09,100
Cause like, me and Fortnite is so carefree that I'm like, I don't, I know I'm not gonna play this game competitively.

491
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:12,060
I know I can apply myself, like I could play competitively.

492
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:16,380
Yeah, I was like, you know what, $125 is $125.

493
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:18,640
That's what I'm saying.

494
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:19,260
Yeah.

495
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:23,600
Like, you know what, $125, I'm fine with that.

496
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:24,960
Like, I, I...

497
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,320
Oh shit, you still have your crown?

498
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,920
How do you still... I won my last game.

499
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,400
How do you still...

500
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:31,920
Okay.

501
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:36,980
Okay, so we're gonna land, we're landing here.

502
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:37,320
We're landing here.

503
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,560
There's the Nitro Dome, that's it, right?

504
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:39,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

505
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:42,400
Okay, I'm gonna land on the outside of the Nitro.

506
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,480
Yeah, I think we just land on the outside.

507
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:44,340
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

508
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:47,260
Alright chat, game number one, let's fucking go!

509
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:48,600
I dropped?

510
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:49,260
I don't know.

511
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:49,860
I'm dropping out.

512
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,440
Yeah, I don't know if that's too much.

513
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:52,540
No, that's fine.

514
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:53,180
That's actually fine.

515
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:56,020
Cause I know, like, it's the outskirt.

516
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:58,080
You just have to land on the outskirt and you're fine.

517
00:20:58,760 --> 00:20:59,440
Yeah, yeah.

518
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:01,680
As long as, like, there's actually, um...

519
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,420
I'm trying to think what side's safer.

520
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:04,760
I think this side's better?

521
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,140
I don't know.

522
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:08,940
There's a lot of people that have the same plan as us.

523
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:10,700
So I don't know.

524
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:15,500
Look at all these people landing on the outskirts!

525
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,720
Can people, like, kill us right away or no?

526
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:20,940
Yeah, yeah, they can, they can, they can.

527
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:21,880
Oh shit!

528
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,440
Okay, wait, we land together, right?

529
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:24,480
Yeah, where are you landing?

530
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,780
I'm landing right here, I'm landing right here.

531
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:27,040
Okay, okay, I'll land here.

532
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:28,080
Oh my god.

533
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,400
Oh my god.

534
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:32,220
Wait, can I use my gun yet?

535
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,940
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you can't instantly, you can't instantly.

536
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:35,260
Okay, I got a gun, I got a gun, I got a gun.

537
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,980
There's people below you, there's people below you.

538
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:38,420
Okay.

539
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,180
Alright, I landed.

540
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,060
I leave you.

541
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:42,320
Do you have a gun?

542
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:42,640
Goodbye.

543
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:42,960
No.

544
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:43,840
I left.

545
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:45,360
Okay, I'm leaving.

546
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:46,160
I'm leaving.

547
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:47,060
I'm out.

548
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:47,600
I'm out.

549
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:48,640
I'm poking out.

550
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:51,320
Somebody instantly grabbed a car and they fucking booked it.

551
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:51,940
Wait, what's over there?

552
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:52,320
It's down here.

553
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:53,720
I might die.

554
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,000
Oh.

555
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:58,020
Oh shit, this guy is zooming.

556
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:00,680
Whoa, what the fuck?

557
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,200
Oh, there's a guy on you?

558
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,300
Yeah, there's a guy on me.

559
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:07,520
Oh, there's cars, there's so many cars.

560
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:10,380
Oh my god.

561
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:13,720
Are you sure we can kill him?

562
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:15,760
I'm scared, I'm really scared.

563
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,700
I'm so scared.

564
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:18,600
I went up the zip.

565
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:21,800
I'm really scared.

566
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,160
There were cars trying to run me over.

567
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:24,700
Where are you?

568
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:25,860
I'm below you.

569
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:26,260
I'm below you.

570
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:29,200
Okay, I looted some potion.

571
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:30,860
Okay, let's leave.

572
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:31,600
Let's fucking go.

573
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:32,800
Let's fucking go.

574
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:34,260
Let's fucking go.

575
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:36,540
I almost had several cars trying to run me over.

576
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:41,520
There is a vehicle that spawns over here that we can grab?

577
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,500
You have a gun, right?

578
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:44,700
Yeah, I have two guns.

579
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:48,080
That was some Mad Max shit right there.

580
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,460
Go through this, uh...

581
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:53,600
Go through the little ring.

582
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,220
Oh my god.

583
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:57,100
Are they here?

584
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:58,620
No, we're good, we're good.

585
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:00,200
There's no car here, but we're good.

586
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:00,800
We can live.

587
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,680
Okay, we can live for a little bit.

588
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:03,820
We can live.

589
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:07,900
Oh, I got a Flowberry Fizz, whatever that fucking shit is.

590
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,580
It's like a big jizz bottle or whatever.

591
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:11,820
Oh, do we need that?

592
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:13,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah, use it, use it right now.

593
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,220
Click and hold, click and hold.

594
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:16,500
Woo!

595
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,080
Let's go!

596
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,460
You're gonna be okay!

597
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:22,360
Alright.

598
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,160
Do you need more?

599
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:23,920
No, you're fine.

600
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:24,660
No, no, I'm good, I'm good.

601
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:25,260
Okay.

602
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:27,620
Do you have any movement?

603
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:28,460
Do you want more shockwaves?

604
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,840
No, I... Wait, actually I do.

605
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:31,640
What am I holding?

606
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,100
I'm holding a shield breaker.

607
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:33,500
Yeah, yeah, I'm gonna drop it too.

608
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:35,440
I gotta get the shockwaves.

609
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:37,500
Oh, the EMPs?

610
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,920
Those stop vehicles like instantly.

611
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:41,760
Oh, then we should get that, right?

612
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,380
They're really good.

613
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:44,720
I don't know.

614
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,060
People are gonna play this first round.

615
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:47,460
That's the only thing I'm, like, unsure about.

616
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,680
I don't even know if people are gonna play any of the rounds.

617
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:51,880
Alright, one person's dead dead.

618
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:53,160
Oh.

619
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:54,960
I'm glad it's not us!

620
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:55,480
Yeah!

621
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,420
Thank fucking God!

622
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:00,960
Oh, there's...

623
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,180
I got more nitro splashes.

624
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:07,180
The, um, infinite I have no idea what gun I have.

625
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,220
What the fuck is this?

626
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:09,440
Oh, wait, what's this?

627
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:11,020
Remote explosives.

628
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,560
Oh, there's a car coming through?

629
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,000
Oh.

630
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:16,040
They're coming to us.

631
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:16,920
Wait...

632
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,120
Right over here.

633
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:19,620
I think they're gone.

634
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:20,040
Oh!

635
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:21,140
Magneto gloves!

636
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:21,820
Huge!

637
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:22,400
Oh, that's good!

638
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:23,460
Yeah, yeah.

639
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:24,380
Oh, do you wanna try them?

640
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:24,960
No, no, no.

641
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:25,420
That's fine.

642
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:26,300
That's fine.

643
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:27,000
I don't think I...

644
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,300
You should give me any power.

645
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:30,660
I'm gonna drop...

646
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:32,620
Should I have magneto gloves?

647
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:33,760
I'm kinda worried about that.

648
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:34,980
I feel like maybe I shouldn't have.

649
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:40,380
Oh, I'm so unsure what to carry right now.

650
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,140
I don't know, like...

651
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:41,440
It's okay.

652
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:42,500
We already got two points.

653
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:44,000
Oh, that's true.

654
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:44,340
We did.

655
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:48,060
We already automatically got two points.

656
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:48,680
That's alright.

657
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:51,580
Uh, do you wanna carry the Gibby domes?

658
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:52,220
Uh, Gibby bullets?

659
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:52,600
Oh, yeah.

660
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:52,600
Sure.

661
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:55,060
There's, uh, some here, and then there's nitros here.

662
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:58,600
Uh, do we want nitros or dome?

663
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:00,260
Um...

664
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:01,560
I have nitros, actually.

665
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:02,220
You can carry domes.

666
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:02,580
Okay, I'll get domes.

667
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:03,520
I'll just use them on us.

668
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:03,840
Yeah.

669
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:08,380
And then, um... Damn, like, I'm unsure of, like, what weapons to use.

670
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:11,540
Uh, cause, like, I think people are gonna play for zone, mostly?

671
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:13,840
So... I mean, are we in... We're...

672
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:16,180
We are in zone at the moment, so...

673
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:17,300
We're chillin' right now, yeah.

674
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:18,200
Yeah, we're chillin' here.

675
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:20,820
Only one person's died, which is very scary.

676
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:23,140
Damn.

677
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:23,540
Um...

678
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,380
Man, I'm such a scuffler.

679
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,780
You wanna keep looting, or you wanna chill?

680
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:28,460
Uh, I don't mind either.

681
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:30,400
You know what?

682
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:32,260
Let's go... Let's go...

683
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:32,640
Oh, wait.

684
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:33,540
Is the bus starting by?

685
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:34,860
I'm gonna chill here for a sec.

686
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:36,380
Oh, is that a battle bus?

687
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:37,800
Uh, no.

688
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:38,280
It's, uh...

689
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,860
It's, uh, NPCs.

690
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:40,880
Oh, okay.

691
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
It is a battle bus, though.

692
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:42,380
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

693
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:45,100
You think somebody's on it?

694
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:46,200
I just...

695
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:49,400
What are they doing?

696
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,200
Oh, they're just, like, rotating.

697
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:51,820
That's so weird.

698
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:53,940
Is that somebody on that battle bus?

699
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:55,700
No, it's NPCs.

700
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:56,160
It's all NPCs.

701
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:56,660
Okay, okay.

702
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,160
Um... Oh, they got rebooted!

703
00:25:58,420 --> 00:25:59,380
Wait, nobody's dead!

704
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:02,180
Nobody died in the grand party?

705
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:03,560
In the Nitro Dome?

706
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:05,460
How's that possible?

707
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:07,440
You wanna go to Pleasant?

708
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:08,880
You wanna go over here?

709
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:09,200
Sure.

710
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:11,460
Alright, let's try to get, like, more looted.

711
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,060
I'm gonna burn a Nitro on us?

712
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:13,540
Yeah.

713
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:14,560
Okay.

714
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:18,060
I'm just surprised nobody died!

715
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:19,380
I'm just surprised nobody died!

716
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:21,060
Oh my god, I'm gonna say that and then we're gonna die.

717
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:24,760
Should be able to take fall damage here.

718
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:26,840
Or no fall damage, I mean.

719
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:30,800
And then... I don't know if it's looted here or not.

720
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:32,960
I saw a car over there, but I don't know if that's the battle bus.

721
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:34,320
Oh, it's the battle bus.

722
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:34,880
Yeah, we're good.

723
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:36,560
Oh, it is looted here.

724
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:40,600
Okay, so there might be someone here.

725
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:42,680
Be very careful.

726
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:43,840
Okay.

727
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:47,020
I'm gonna head to you.

728
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:49,400
Ape strong together.

729
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:50,860
Ape strong!

730
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:52,580
John strong together.

731
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:58,700
Alright, let's keep on clearing the buildings together.

732
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:01,320
Oh yeah, it's, like, super looted.

733
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,560
Oh, there's more domes here?

734
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:04,420
Oh, nice.

735
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:10,540
The one thing you're gonna notice is that the bunkers aren't, or the houses, aren't as common here either.

736
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:11,560
That's good.

737
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:12,260
That's good to know.

738
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:13,980
On, uh, normal mode.

739
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:17,120
Oh, the chest is above?

740
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:17,720
Oh, it's upstairs.

741
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:18,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I got it.

742
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:20,420
Oh, med kit.

743
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:21,280
We need it.

744
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,780
See, I'm not carrying any heal.

745
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:26,160
I should probably carry heals over the It's also cabbages.

746
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:28,640
Oh, we do have cabbages.

747
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,220
I think it's gonna be one of the heal items, I think, in one of the games.

748
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:33,020
Oh.

749
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:34,500
Oh, people fighting?

750
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:36,080
Yeah, I hear gunshots.

751
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:43,180
I really want to, like, mess Oh, there's houses here.

752
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:44,500
I guess I should probably carry the houses.

753
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:45,520
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

754
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:46,800
House equals win.

755
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:48,660
I'm carrying the houses.

756
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:49,720
Oh, there's EMPs.

757
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:50,480
Wait.

758
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:51,960
They're driving by.

759
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:52,860
Yeah, I hear shots.

760
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:53,160
I hear shots.

761
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:53,500
Yeah.

762
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:55,280
I'm going to...

763
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:55,860
I hear lots of shots.

764
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,340
Yeah, I'm gonna see if I...

765
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:59,360
On me, on me, on me, on me, on me, on me.

766
00:27:59,440 --> 00:27:59,760
Right here.

767
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:01,440
I'm looking.

768
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:03,040
They're on me, on me.

769
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:05,400
Holy shit, I think they're above me.

770
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:06,620
Oh, they are above.

771
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:08,540
I might be dead.

772
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:09,640
I'm actually going to shockwave.

773
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:10,160
I'm shockwaving away.

774
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:10,720
I'm shockwaving away.

775
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,120
Shockwave yourself towards me if you can.

776
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:14,620
Okay, I don't know if they know I'm here.

777
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:15,940
I don't think they do.

778
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:16,900
I think I'm dead.

779
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,940
I'm, like, getting hardchased right now.

780
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:19,020
Holy shit!

781
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:20,180
They went for you?

782
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:20,980
Yup.

783
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:22,800
No!

784
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:23,600
No!

785
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:27,700
Of course they have gloves and shockwaves.

786
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:28,720
I literally have no shockwave.

787
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,720
Oh, no, they have Magneto gloves.

788
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:31,800
Actually, you can chill.

789
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:32,220
You can chill.

790
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:32,540
You can chill.

791
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:32,720
Okay.

792
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:33,720
They don't know about you.

793
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:34,540
Yeah, they don't know about you.

794
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:39,780
Wait, what?

795
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:40,180
Wait, what?

796
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:40,480
What the fuck?

797
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:41,100
I didn't know!

798
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:42,080
I didn't know!

799
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:42,600
Wait, what?

800
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,000
I didn't know!

801
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:48,420
What?

802
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:52,220
I was literally in the corner!

803
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:52,940
I was literally in the corner!

804
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:55,480
I was literally in the corner!

805
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,540
I'm so confused!

806
00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:59,480
I am so confused, too.

807
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,340
I wanna, like, just watch replays.

808
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:02,380
See, like, how they did it.

809
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:05,200
How did they know I was there?

810
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:06,240
How did they know I was there?

811
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,260
I'm so confused.

812
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:08,880
What the fuck?

813
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:10,900
Where is this teammate?

814
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,120
So, they had the vehicle, and then they were just driving around?

815
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,700
But, like, were they baiting people?

816
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:18,160
Or... I'm so confused.

817
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:18,680
What?

818
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:20,600
How did he know?

819
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,360
How did he know?

820
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:26,880
That's so unfortunate that the first medallion we came across is the most busted one.

821
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,260
Cause that's the...

822
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:30,740
It's the Nitro medallion, where it gives you unlimited Nitro.

823
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:31,160
Oh!

824
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,660
So he has unlimited Nitro.

825
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:34,320
Yeah.

826
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:36,300
I'm just like...

827
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:40,100
How did they, like, find you the moment you were just, like, hiding there, right?

828
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:40,860
Yeah!

829
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,060
Wait, does the medallion show where I am?

830
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,560
No, uh-uh.

831
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:46,240
What?

832
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:48,740
I...

833
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,200
I am so confused.

834
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:52,960
I wanna, like, go back and replay.

835
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:56,140
I just don't understand.

836
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,460
I just... I actually don't understand.

837
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:01,840
I just wanna know what happened.

838
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:03,720
But he was just in the corner!

839
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:07,540
And he fucking blew up the exact house I was in!

840
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:09,820
That's why I'm, like, so confused.

841
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:14,020
Like, did you... I mean, like, they knew you were alive, right?

842
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:17,720
Yeah, but they blew up the one house I was in.

843
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:20,160
That was so confusing.

844
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:21,100
Wait, what?

845
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,440
They smelled... They... Oh.

846
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,060
The more medallions you have...

847
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:30,260
But... Oh, no, but I didn't have the medallions.

848
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:30,780
I didn't.

849
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,080
Yeah, Yogi did not have it, though.

850
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:34,500
Yeah.

851
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:35,820
Yeah, yeah, I didn't have it.

852
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:38,000
That's why I was, like, how did he find out?

853
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:38,840
Yeah.

854
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,960
I just... I gotta see!

855
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:43,500
I'm, like, so confused!

856
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:44,180
Yeah!

857
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:48,700
I'm just, like, I thought I was... I thought I was safe!

858
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:50,240
That's why I didn't move!

859
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,300
Okay, so...

860
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:53,920
So I'm getting chased.

861
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:55,620
Understandable.

862
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:56,980
Are you watching the replay now?

863
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:57,700
Yeah.

864
00:31:01,130 --> 00:31:02,170
You know, this is...

865
00:31:04,710 --> 00:31:06,950
That's when I know I knew my place.

866
00:31:11,430 --> 00:31:12,890
Were you crouched the whole time?

867
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:14,190
Yeah, you were literally... Yeah!

868
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:17,940
Wait, what?

869
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:18,900
What?

870
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:21,480
He literally goes straight for you!

871
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:22,020
Wait, what?

872
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,340
Wait, what?

873
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:25,720
Uh...

874
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:27,560
Uh...

875
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:30,120
Are you watching my POV right now?

876
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:30,400
No.

877
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:31,440
Oh.

878
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:33,620
What?

879
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:34,180
Huh?

880
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,380
You're not even exposed for anything!

881
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:37,040
Wait.

882
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:39,120
Okay, before I get killed...

883
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:42,660
Let's see...

884
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:43,260
Let's see...

885
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:44,220
Let's see...

886
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,520
Okay, so I'm shock waving.

887
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:51,760
Maybe they saw me go in that room and they just assumed I never left.

888
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,700
Yeah, that could have been the case, yeah.

889
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:56,740
I think that's... that's really the only thing I could, like, imagine.

890
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:57,700
Oh my god!

891
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:58,920
Wait, why are they going to the store?

892
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:01,320
Oh, because they're trying to find the medallion person?

893
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:04,820
Oh, no, they just wanted gas.

894
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,000
Okay, I was like...

895
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,940
I was like, why are they in the store?

896
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:08,980
They just wanted gas.

897
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,320
Holy shit, that's so fucking...

898
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:15,940
Fortnite gamers, man.

899
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:16,980
Oh, you know what it was?

900
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:17,240
What?

901
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:19,340
So, um, they probably saw your footsteps.

902
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,120
And then...

903
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,800
Yeah, and then you wanted to crouch, but like...

904
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:27,840
They just went straight back to the building probably because that's the last place that they saw you.

905
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:29,280
But I could have left!

906
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,020
I know, right?

907
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,580
I could... how did they... I could have left!

908
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:34,520
I...

909
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:38,400
I'm, like, very, very confused.

910
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:38,880
Oh my god!

911
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:40,680
Fortnite gamers.

912
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:42,720
This is why condoms games deserve nothing.

913
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:45,400
They deserve nothing.

914
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:50,360
Okay, wait, what's weird?

915
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:52,200
Okay, this is the weird part.

916
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:57,020
The only weird part is that he goes straight for your room.

917
00:32:57,140 --> 00:32:59,520
Like, he doesn't even, like, just tackle the building.

918
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:00,760
He goes straight for the room.

919
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:01,680
What the fuck?

920
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:03,260
I got red so well.

921
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:05,260
And you're, like, crouched here.

922
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:06,980
What the fuck?

923
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:08,640
If only we know who they are.

924
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,140
They're all not in this mode.

925
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,900
I mean, like, I can see what it is in the kill... or in, uh, in replay.

926
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:16,340
No, no, wait, who is it?

927
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:19,360
Maybe you can just see what how they... they must have calmed out or something.

928
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:21,860
Yeah, they probably... they probably just calmed it.

929
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:22,720
They probably calmed it.

930
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:24,180
They're probably, like, I think they're in the building?

931
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,880
And then they're like, wait, what the fuck?

932
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:27,180
He's right here or whatever, you know?

933
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:28,700
That's probably what they were saying.

934
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:29,000
Fucking coward.

935
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,140
That's fucking crazy.

936
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:34,640
Unlucky.

937
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:35,100
Oh my god.

938
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,160
Bro, this...

939
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:39,980
I think this game mode is worse than yesterday.

940
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:46,400
It's just very unlucky, because, like, our first medallion is the most broken one.

941
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:48,700
And... I guess, like, theoretically, we could have kept arriving.

942
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:50,140
Like, the first one we face?

943
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,520
Or their...

944
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:54,780
Yeah, the first one that we face is, like, the most broken medallion.

945
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:56,140
Oh my god.

946
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:58,700
Oh my god.

947
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:00,960
I thought they were supposed...

948
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,420
Bro, this guy's just literally...

949
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:04,840
Does this car not have HP?

950
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:07,800
Like, can it ram into everything?

951
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:09,260
I don't... Yeah, that's a...

952
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:10,000
It's a boss car.

953
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:11,200
So, when they get the...

954
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:15,420
the boss car, then, um, it has, like, more HP.

955
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:17,100
And then it also goes faster.

956
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:19,120
It basically is an overtune vehicle.

957
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:20,600
In, like, every way.

958
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:21,120
Oh...

959
00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:25,120
What the fuck?

960
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,060
Are they just gonna win?

961
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:30,440
Are they not?

962
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:32,040
Brother!

963
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:34,760
It feels like they have, like, the most busted shit!

964
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:37,000
He's literally driving around everywhere.

965
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,080
I think we should...

966
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:40,740
Yeah, we definitely should have got a car.

967
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:44,480
Okay, so, like, one person is using the gloves.

968
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:46,200
Yeah, because it's allowed.

969
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:46,720
Yeah.

970
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:50,300
Yeah, I've... Yeah, see, I was thinking, like, oh, I'm gonna use the...

971
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:51,660
Magneto gloves.

972
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,980
And then I can just, like, damage cars.

973
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:55,040
Because it's really good against vehicles.

974
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:56,440
Ah...

975
00:34:57,620 --> 00:35:01,120
If they're not banned, then I'm just gonna keep on trying to... Oh my god!

976
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:02,500
It just depends on how aggressive we're playing.

977
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:08,640
Bro, this guy knows where all the fucking places to go!

978
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:13,680
I feel like if we just had a car, we could just drive around and not care.

979
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,740
Like, we don't have to worry about rotation.

980
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:17,980
Yeah.

981
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:24,600
I mean, the first... It's really weird with, like, these rulesets, because it's, like, very random.

982
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:25,360
Yeah.

983
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,220
And I think it's...

984
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:34,220
They're just trying to, like, capitalize on just, like, alright, make it chaotic and all that stuff, but it sucks even more when it's, uh...

985
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:38,020
People would get good RNG on already very chaotic modes.

986
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:40,100
Yeah.

987
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:41,120
Wait, so we...

988
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:44,640
In second mode, there's safe zone, so we could just grab a car somewhere.

989
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:46,220
Does our drop have a car?

990
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:47,140
Yeah!

991
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:51,200
Um, so I got us a drop spot, um, outside of the safe zones.

992
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:51,740
Okay.

993
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:52,500
So...

994
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:56,500
Our, uh, drop spot doesn't have a vehicle... Actually, no, it has two vehicles.

995
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:56,840
I lied.

996
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:59,540
There's one, like... Yeah, we can just get a vehicle and just drive away.

997
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:00,920
Yeah, yeah.

998
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:02,120
And just survive with a car.

999
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:04,980
Because I feel that's how... that's how people are surviving.

1000
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:05,960
Yup.

1001
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:09,280
Oh, they got EMP?

1002
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:10,100
Oh, that's smart.

1003
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:11,440
Wait, who?

1004
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:12,500
Bubble shields.

1005
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:18,100
I'm, like, watching the Twitch Rivals POV right now, because I backed out of the game because I wanted to see, like, the...

1006
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:19,180
the replay.

1007
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:24,040
I'm just watching the car, people.

1008
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:25,840
I think they're gonna win.

1009
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:30,180
They seem like the type of team... What?

1010
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:30,740
How?

1011
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:31,160
What?

1012
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:33,300
Did they get EMP?

1013
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:38,560
No, they, like, instantly shot that bush, so I'm just like, how did they know?

1014
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:40,560
Never trust a bush.

1015
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:42,440
You see a bush, you're just like, well... Holy shit.

1016
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:43,920
Yeah, but he was so paranoid.

1017
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:47,680
He, like, he got a car just to shoot at that bush.

1018
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:53,160
I was like, I guess they know this map so well, and they're like, there's no bush.

1019
00:36:53,220 --> 00:37:00,080
It's like, it's like those hide and seek, um, like, in Gmod, like, hide and seek, where people, like... No, prop hunt.

1020
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:00,860
It's like prop hunt.

1021
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:05,020
Yeah, yeah, where they're like, I know this map, like, the back of my hand.

1022
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:08,160
So they're like, what is this random bush doing here?

1023
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:13,720
At X100004 Y430, there's never a bush there.

1024
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:16,200
So then he's like, that's sus.

1025
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:22,580
It's like prop hunt.

1026
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:23,240
I think that's a player.

1027
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:24,220
Fucking shoot it.

1028
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:31,020
It's literally those prop hunt hunters who play the same map 100 million times so they know exactly where's what.

1029
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:32,980
It's basically Fortnite.

1030
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:35,820
Fortnite is everyone is literally a prop and you just shoot it.

1031
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,080
I'm just kinda thinking that now.

1032
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:52,000
Cause, like, there was like, there was no indication that there, like, it was just this random bush and the moment they saw that bush, they went out and shot it.

1033
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:53,020
Damn.

1034
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:53,780
Wait, really?

1035
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:56,020
They just, like, hopped down and was like, what?

1036
00:37:56,380 --> 00:38:02,480
Yeah, the guy literally got off the car just to shoot that random bush and then me and my chat was like, question mark?

1037
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:03,580
What?

1038
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:05,440
What the...

1039
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:08,240
Hey, I gotta, like, I wanna see your POV now.

1040
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:10,380
Cause, like, I'm not watching the match anymore.

1041
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:10,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1042
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:12,680
No, that's why I'm so confused.

1043
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:18,400
The fact that this man got out of his car just... Dude, it's all just cars!

1044
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
They're all just chasing each other in cars!

1045
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:25,680
That was this Fortnite season at the very, very beginning.

1046
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:29,780
Cause, like, there was, like, nothing to counter them.

1047
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:30,520
It was ridiculous.

1048
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:32,140
Oh, my god!

1049
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:33,540
Oh, they got EMP'd!

1050
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:35,620
Oh, shit!

1051
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:36,220
Oh, my god!

1052
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:36,820
Oh, my god!

1053
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:38,040
It's a non-car fight!

1054
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:41,600
One guy EMP'd their car!

1055
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:43,940
Fuck that car in particular!

1056
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:48,020
This is very...

1057
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:50,980
Okay, I feel like they should ban cars.

1058
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:53,900
This is...

1059
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:57,640
Like, what the fuck am I watching right now?

1060
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:00,300
It's literally just... Sorry guys, I tabbed out.

1061
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,680
So that's why there's no sound.

1062
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:04,040
I'm literally watching car fights.

1063
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:08,700
Like, we got fucked just cause we didn't have a car.

1064
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:14,000
We're now playing Twisted Metal.

1065
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,180
This is literally Twisted Metal right now.

1066
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:17,800
Oh, my god!

1067
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,220
Those poor fools!

1068
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:20,540
Oh, my god!

1069
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:21,460
They're just hiding in there!

1070
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:23,100
They're just hiding in the house!

1071
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:25,500
Fools!

1072
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:26,720
That was yesterday!

1073
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:28,880
This meta is car meta!

1074
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:37,000
Honestly, seeing how, like, vehicle heavy it is, I'm gonna definitely run my anti-car, like, loadout.

1075
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:40,280
Cause I think this is all people are gonna do is just drive around and stuff.

1076
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:40,580
Yeah.

1077
00:39:44,450 --> 00:39:47,730
Bro, what happened to the players that were in that house?

1078
00:39:48,210 --> 00:39:49,390
Wait, did they die already?

1079
00:39:49,650 --> 00:39:50,910
I don't know, they just disappeared.

1080
00:39:51,470 --> 00:39:52,610
They're just chilling here.

1081
00:39:52,830 --> 00:39:54,250
They're like parked here.

1082
00:39:55,630 --> 00:39:58,370
They just parked here cause they don't have to move.

1083
00:39:59,770 --> 00:40:01,150
Wait, I think we do...

1084
00:40:01,750 --> 00:40:03,250
Honestly, I think this is car meta.

1085
00:40:03,950 --> 00:40:05,930
There's no way we can play this without cars.

1086
00:40:06,890 --> 00:40:09,870
There's like four fucking medallions all around them.

1087
00:40:10,230 --> 00:40:12,370
They're making a Venn diagram on the map.

1088
00:40:12,950 --> 00:40:14,390
Let me see the next rules.

1089
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:17,390
I think the next game... It's a safe zone.

1090
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:19,450
...is...

1091
00:40:20,470 --> 00:40:21,890
So, there's definitely...

1092
00:40:21,890 --> 00:40:22,690
Oh, so it's a safe zone.

1093
00:40:22,750 --> 00:40:23,450
That's what it is, yeah.

1094
00:40:23,810 --> 00:40:25,670
Yeah, so nobody's gonna shoot us.

1095
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:27,810
Okay, well...

1096
00:40:27,810 --> 00:40:30,130
Bro, they're playing hide and seek with cars.

1097
00:40:30,190 --> 00:40:32,230
One car is just trying to hide behind buildings.

1098
00:40:32,550 --> 00:40:38,250
They're playing hide and seek behind a car.

1099
00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:44,570
Oh my god, if we were still alive it'd be so much fun to use the magneto gloves on all these.

1100
00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:47,150
Oh my god.

1101
00:40:47,950 --> 00:40:49,010
I love it.

1102
00:40:49,890 --> 00:40:58,130
If we, like, hit at the right moment and just come out with all these cars... Yeah, cars are... I think cars are allowed on all games, right?

1103
00:40:58,450 --> 00:40:59,590
I think so, yeah.

1104
00:40:59,670 --> 00:41:00,010
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1105
00:41:00,010 --> 00:41:02,290
I'm going through all the rules and...

1106
00:41:03,590 --> 00:41:06,810
I'm pretty sure... Yeah, it's like vehicles all games.

1107
00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:08,890
Bro, oh my god.

1108
00:41:08,950 --> 00:41:10,010
Oh, wait, they killed...

1109
00:41:10,010 --> 00:41:10,630
Oh, it's bunker!

1110
00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:11,330
Oh my god!

1111
00:41:11,330 --> 00:41:12,590
They're breaking the bunker!

1112
00:41:13,970 --> 00:41:15,930
Yeah, it's like pointless to even have bunkers.

1113
00:41:15,950 --> 00:41:17,450
I mean, like, you can, but like...

1114
00:41:17,450 --> 00:41:19,750
Yeah, he just builds... he just runs over.

1115
00:41:19,930 --> 00:41:21,630
He ramps the fucking bunkers.

1116
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:26,190
So, basically all you have to do is you gotta have a repair tool.

1117
00:41:26,410 --> 00:41:26,890
Yeah.

1118
00:41:27,330 --> 00:41:29,630
And then you can just keep on killing the vehicles.

1119
00:41:29,830 --> 00:41:29,850
Oh!

1120
00:41:29,850 --> 00:41:31,690
I just saw this man run him over.

1121
00:41:33,470 --> 00:41:36,410
How is there still 31 people alive?

1122
00:41:37,510 --> 00:41:39,490
This is... Oh, thank fucking god.

1123
00:41:39,510 --> 00:41:39,890
Okay.

1124
00:41:40,650 --> 00:41:41,130
Insane.

1125
00:41:41,330 --> 00:41:43,390
Okay, there's way too many people alive.

1126
00:41:43,510 --> 00:41:44,950
Like, how many cars are there?

1127
00:41:45,150 --> 00:41:49,330
Like, there's actually way too many people alive.

1128
00:41:50,490 --> 00:41:51,590
Wait, where's the other?

1129
00:41:52,050 --> 00:41:53,330
Oh, the other one's here.

1130
00:41:54,070 --> 00:41:55,950
Oh, they... he left him to die.

1131
00:41:56,370 --> 00:41:57,310
Oh, they're like...

1132
00:41:57,870 --> 00:41:58,950
Oh, never mind, they're dead.

1133
00:41:59,210 --> 00:41:59,770
Wait, what?

1134
00:42:01,670 --> 00:42:09,790
Oh, wait, okay, so this condom has been... Oh, no, never mind, their teammate literally... Yeah, no, their teammate literally died, no.

1135
00:42:09,930 --> 00:42:10,950
Their teammate is...

1136
00:42:11,330 --> 00:42:14,830
is the... Oh, shit, he got fucking... Oh, my god!

1137
00:42:16,430 --> 00:42:18,270
Did he just stole his car?

1138
00:42:18,810 --> 00:42:19,670
Wait, what?

1139
00:42:19,970 --> 00:42:20,950
Oh, he just got it.

1140
00:42:20,970 --> 00:42:21,750
Wait, did he oink it?

1141
00:42:21,850 --> 00:42:22,450
He might oink it.

1142
00:42:22,470 --> 00:42:23,550
Wait, why is there three people?

1143
00:42:23,730 --> 00:42:25,210
Why is there three people in the car?

1144
00:42:25,730 --> 00:42:26,510
Why is there...

1145
00:42:28,430 --> 00:42:30,850
Wait, why is there... Why is there...

1146
00:42:30,850 --> 00:42:32,830
You see three people in the car, right?

1147
00:42:33,610 --> 00:42:34,010
Yeah.

1148
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:34,870
Why is there...

1149
00:42:34,870 --> 00:42:36,270
Wait, what?

1150
00:42:36,990 --> 00:42:40,370
You can literally get into an enemy's vehicle and just ride with them.

1151
00:42:40,430 --> 00:42:41,210
It's so silly.

1152
00:42:41,330 --> 00:42:42,850
It's so fucking silly.

1153
00:42:43,030 --> 00:42:43,610
Wait, were they oinking together?

1154
00:42:44,650 --> 00:42:45,330
What?

1155
00:42:46,470 --> 00:42:47,130
How?

1156
00:42:49,270 --> 00:42:49,950
What?

1157
00:42:50,330 --> 00:42:51,290
Are they...

1158
00:42:51,290 --> 00:42:52,290
Is this an alliance?

1159
00:42:53,130 --> 00:42:55,030
Are they... Who did the bullshit?

1160
00:42:57,230 --> 00:42:59,610
Why is there four people in this car?

1161
00:43:00,230 --> 00:43:02,770
Why there's four people in this car?

1162
00:43:03,450 --> 00:43:04,990
I don't understand.

1163
00:43:05,370 --> 00:43:06,650
This is actually...

1164
00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:08,310
This is ridiculous.

1165
00:43:09,190 --> 00:43:12,050
I'm very familiar with zero bill tournaments.

1166
00:43:12,270 --> 00:43:14,970
This is actually so ridiculous.

1167
00:43:15,370 --> 00:43:16,370
It is so silly.

1168
00:43:16,610 --> 00:43:21,670
This is like mutual destruction because all four of them they're not shooting at each other.

1169
00:43:22,010 --> 00:43:23,910
They just...

1170
00:43:23,910 --> 00:43:25,130
I don't understand.

1171
00:43:26,610 --> 00:43:34,510
It's wild because they get to basically just work with each other and there's no penalty because they basically just get to keep living.

1172
00:43:34,930 --> 00:43:35,290
Yeah.

1173
00:43:36,290 --> 00:43:38,290
It's so... It's so...

1174
00:43:38,310 --> 00:43:38,630
It's so random.

1175
00:43:39,250 --> 00:43:41,930
Like, is it because he saw they were also condom men?

1176
00:43:42,210 --> 00:43:44,290
So they're like condom men stick together.

1177
00:43:44,490 --> 00:43:45,910
Condoms stick together.

1178
00:43:46,110 --> 00:43:47,430
Like, I don't...

1179
00:43:47,430 --> 00:43:49,050
Condoms versus everyone.

1180
00:43:49,390 --> 00:43:51,710
I don't understand why they did it.

1181
00:43:51,870 --> 00:43:56,350
How come the other car people shot him but that car didn't?

1182
00:43:58,810 --> 00:43:59,770
I love...

1183
00:43:59,770 --> 00:44:02,490
I love hearing your reactions to all these things.

1184
00:44:02,510 --> 00:44:04,310
It is so fucking valid.

1185
00:44:04,610 --> 00:44:05,650
I don't understand.

1186
00:44:05,650 --> 00:44:06,790
It is so valid.

1187
00:44:08,310 --> 00:44:10,050
Oh, thank fucking god.

1188
00:44:10,650 --> 00:44:11,870
Oh, they're like...

1189
00:44:11,870 --> 00:44:13,410
They're like one HP?

1190
00:44:13,730 --> 00:44:14,830
Oh my god.

1191
00:44:14,890 --> 00:44:16,810
Thank fucking god.

1192
00:44:17,130 --> 00:44:18,510
This is insane.

1193
00:44:19,310 --> 00:44:20,430
Oh my god.

1194
00:44:20,470 --> 00:44:22,870
I'm just happy that team didn't win.

1195
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:31,460
I prefer no build, but what the fuck?

1196
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:32,420
No build, guys.

1197
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,580
What the fuck is this?

1198
00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:36,300
It's literally no build.

1199
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:37,820
That's what I'm saying.

1200
00:44:38,740 --> 00:44:40,180
That is what I'm saying.

1201
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:40,200
Holy shit.

1202
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:42,120
This guy's literally one HP.

1203
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:43,320
Oh my god.

1204
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:44,200
No!

1205
00:44:44,220 --> 00:44:47,320
Why is it called no build when there's all these?

1206
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:48,920
Don't let him win!

1207
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:49,240
No!

1208
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:49,700
Listen!

1209
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:54,480
A condom man win!

1210
00:44:55,460 --> 00:44:55,620
A condom man win!

1211
00:44:57,140 --> 00:44:57,820
No!

1212
00:44:58,400 --> 00:44:58,740
No!

1213
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:02,180
This is unfair.

1214
00:45:02,580 --> 00:45:04,180
We should report them.

1215
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:05,320
We should report them.

1216
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:10,280
Wait, I don't even know who eliminated me.

1217
00:45:10,380 --> 00:45:10,880
I'm gonna...

1218
00:45:15,110 --> 00:45:17,190
Teaming up with enemies.

1219
00:45:18,770 --> 00:45:20,950
I saw him team up!

1220
00:45:21,110 --> 00:45:22,450
I saw him!

1221
00:45:22,990 --> 00:45:23,850
He teamed!

1222
00:45:23,870 --> 00:45:24,550
Oh my god.

1223
00:45:24,750 --> 00:45:27,390
He 100% teamed!

1224
00:45:28,590 --> 00:45:28,750
I...

1225
00:45:34,050 --> 00:45:35,690
We all saw

1226
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:40,080
him!

1227
00:45:40,580 --> 00:45:41,960
No, you're not!

1228
00:45:42,180 --> 00:45:43,900
No, you're on it!

1229
00:45:43,940 --> 00:45:44,720
You're on it.

1230
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:49,740
We literally all saw him team, guys.

1231
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:52,080
We have video proof.

1232
00:45:52,340 --> 00:45:55,620
He jumped into the car and nobody...

1233
00:45:58,540 --> 00:46:00,340
Nobody did anything.

1234
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:04,880
The condom people made a made a union.

1235
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:07,100
And they said together...

1236
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:10,740
Together we can win against everyone that doesn't use condoms.

1237
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:13,300
That's so fucked up.

1238
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:16,840
Alright.

1239
00:46:17,060 --> 00:46:18,540
Oh, do you have alien...

1240
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:19,320
Do you have an alien skin?

1241
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:20,380
I do.

1242
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:20,860
Yeah, yeah.

1243
00:46:20,860 --> 00:46:21,760
Do you have an alien one too?

1244
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:22,340
No, no.

1245
00:46:22,420 --> 00:46:23,700
I have Dead Space.

1246
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:25,360
Oh, you have Dead Space?

1247
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:26,820
Oh wait, you have Isaac Clarke?

1248
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:27,620
Yeah, I have Isaac.

1249
00:46:27,700 --> 00:46:28,660
It can be an alien.

1250
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:29,280
Yes!

1251
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:30,920
Okay, I'm gonna be a...

1252
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:31,680
I'm gonna be a xenomorph.

1253
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:33,900
Yeah, that's perfect.

1254
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:38,680
I knew that I can be like this gross-ass thing.

1255
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:40,060
Oh god, no.

1256
00:46:41,140 --> 00:46:42,520
No, absolutely not.

1257
00:46:42,780 --> 00:46:43,380
Oh, you're gonna be this one?

1258
00:46:43,660 --> 00:46:44,380
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1259
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:45,160
That's perfect.

1260
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:45,760
That's perfect.

1261
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:46,420
Okay, okay.

1262
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:49,140
I'm gonna put on a... I'm gonna wear a pink backpack.

1263
00:46:50,060 --> 00:46:50,580
Wait, no.

1264
00:46:50,820 --> 00:46:53,160
Actually... I think I have like Isaac's stuff.

1265
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:54,440
I have the health thing.

1266
00:46:54,620 --> 00:46:55,520
Yeah, the life thing.

1267
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:56,680
Oh, yeah, I do.

1268
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:56,940
I do.

1269
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:58,800
I have his like... his shit.

1270
00:46:58,840 --> 00:46:59,800
I have the health thing.

1271
00:46:59,860 --> 00:47:00,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1272
00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:02,020
Yeah.

1273
00:47:02,020 --> 00:47:02,780
Okay, cool.

1274
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:03,780
Okay, there you go.

1275
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:04,760
Nice.

1276
00:47:04,820 --> 00:47:05,640
I'm full of Isaac.

1277
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:08,440
Oh, are you using the...

1278
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:08,860
Is there two?

1279
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:10,120
Let's go.

1280
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:10,740
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1281
00:47:10,820 --> 00:47:11,420
I got the cutter.

1282
00:47:11,540 --> 00:47:11,780
Okay, cool, cool.

1283
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:13,020
I got the cutter on too.

1284
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:13,360
We good.

1285
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:15,540
Come on, Isaac.

1286
00:47:15,940 --> 00:47:17,600
We're gonna work it.

1287
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:20,040
We're gonna work it out.

1288
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:24,100
Okay, it looks fucking ridiculous with the xenomorph.

1289
00:47:27,940 --> 00:47:29,620
I don't remember if it's in Dead Space.

1290
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:30,260
Wait, what?

1291
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:33,240
Wait, what is this one?

1292
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:36,400
That's the... That just got in the store.

1293
00:47:37,260 --> 00:47:38,220
What the fuck?

1294
00:47:39,020 --> 00:47:39,520
Fagada.

1295
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:41,960
Fagada.

1296
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:45,020
Just how I remembered Dead Space.

1297
00:47:47,660 --> 00:47:50,240
Yeah, I remember when Isaac fought this... the xenomorph.

1298
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:50,780
Yeah, yeah.

1299
00:47:50,780 --> 00:47:51,420
In Dead Space 3.

1300
00:47:51,540 --> 00:47:52,740
Yeah, and he went pew, pew.

1301
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:56,180
That's how he did it.

1302
00:47:56,260 --> 00:47:56,760
Literally like that.

1303
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:56,880
Literally.

1304
00:47:58,180 --> 00:48:00,120
He saw the xenomorph, pew, pew.

1305
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:00,840
Yeah.

1306
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:08,160
And then the xenomorph was like, Yo, let's take a selfie!

1307
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:09,760
Yo!

1308
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:12,820
Oh, yeah, I remember when the xenomorph was like, yo, selfie time?

1309
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:14,200
Yeah, yeah, selfie time.

1310
00:48:15,580 --> 00:48:18,280
And then Isaac Opa Ganon styled on him.

1311
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:23,640
It's canon!

1312
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:25,660
It is canon.

1313
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:25,980
It's literally canon.

1314
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:29,120
Wait, when does he do...

1315
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:32,620
Dead Space 5?

1316
00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:34,500
Yeah, yeah, it's in Dead Space 5.

1317
00:48:35,020 --> 00:48:36,600
It's in the newest Dead Space, guys.

1318
00:48:36,700 --> 00:48:41,140
You guys don't know because... and then he was like, only Goku can save us.

1319
00:48:45,860 --> 00:48:46,740
Wait, did you...

1320
00:48:46,740 --> 00:48:47,900
Oh, wait, we don't have a code yet.

1321
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:49,200
No, no, no, yeah.

1322
00:48:49,380 --> 00:48:49,920
I'm waiting for it.

1323
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:50,640
Wait, do we get it?

1324
00:48:51,060 --> 00:48:52,420
Oh, they just... no, no, no, no.

1325
00:48:52,420 --> 00:48:52,740
They didn't.

1326
00:48:53,860 --> 00:48:54,560
Oh my god.

1327
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:55,220
We got this.

1328
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:56,600
We got this.

1329
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:57,500
We got this, guys.

1330
00:48:58,400 --> 00:48:58,760
Easy.

1331
00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:00,600
Alright, so since we're in safe zone...

1332
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:01,780
Wait, where are we landing?

1333
00:49:02,980 --> 00:49:04,420
Um, we're landing at Grim Gate.

1334
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:05,080
Okay.

1335
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:06,740
From where our server is spawned at.

1336
00:49:06,980 --> 00:49:09,680
Okay, you just have to ping it for me.

1337
00:49:10,060 --> 00:49:11,960
Yay, I'll do the pingy ping thing.

1338
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:13,940
Yeah, and then we gotta get a car.

1339
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:16,740
After everything we just saw, we definitely need a car.

1340
00:49:17,020 --> 00:49:18,580
We are gonna get a vehicle.

1341
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:20,500
And then if we...

1342
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:24,940
if our car dies, we gotta steal... we gotta, like, hop in somebody's house.

1343
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:26,380
Oh, wait, wait.

1344
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:30,660
The vehicles were so bad last game that they put...

1345
00:49:30,660 --> 00:49:34,380
they put a poll in the Discord about banning cars.

1346
00:49:34,380 --> 00:49:37,440
Wait, they put a poll on whether or not to ban the cars?

1347
00:49:38,180 --> 00:49:39,460
Wait, where's the poll?

1348
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:41,720
It's in all chats.

1349
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:42,760
Ban cars?

1350
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:43,160
No.

1351
00:49:43,420 --> 00:49:44,560
Cause I wanna...

1352
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:44,720
No!

1353
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:45,500
No!

1354
00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:03,140
Okay, we need to get our own car.

1355
00:50:03,820 --> 00:50:04,720
Let's get a car.

1356
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:07,120
I never got a chance to be in a car.

1357
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:08,960
I should be in a car.

1358
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:10,500
I should have...

1359
00:50:11,220 --> 00:50:14,320
have one free car game.

1360
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:16,720
Gaining one car game.

1361
00:50:18,020 --> 00:50:19,180
Just me, though.

1362
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:22,520
Just me, though.

1363
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:23,680
Uh, new rule?

1364
00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:25,420
Doki is the only one that gets a car.

1365
00:50:25,540 --> 00:50:26,120
Yeah, yeah.

1366
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:27,880
Guys, I'll show you guys what I wrote.

1367
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:34,560
Oh, I love how you already got a reaction.

1368
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:36,460
Yeah, somebody was like, yes.

1369
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:43,060
I had three people that agreed with me.

1370
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:44,340
Thank god.

1371
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:48,680
Okay.

1372
00:50:49,420 --> 00:50:50,400
My god.

1373
00:50:52,380 --> 00:50:52,900
Okay.

1374
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:54,660
What the fuck is FNCS?

1375
00:50:56,260 --> 00:50:58,280
That's a Fortnite competitive.

1376
00:50:58,280 --> 00:50:59,360
Oh, is it like competitive?

1377
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:00,300
Oh.

1378
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:01,900
Yeah, it's all the competitive players, yeah.

1379
00:51:02,220 --> 00:51:05,080
Oh, so right after this they have like a Fortnite tournament.

1380
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:08,360
Oh, they're doing FNCS after.

1381
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:08,520
Yeah.

1382
00:51:08,780 --> 00:51:12,100
So some people were like we should have builds, because we're doing... Okay.

1383
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:14,740
Okay guys, this is what I wrote and then people agreed with me.

1384
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:18,540
I love that everyone's just like, yes, you don't get a car.

1385
00:51:19,820 --> 00:51:21,160
Nobody definitely gets a car.

1386
00:51:23,100 --> 00:51:24,140
Just me though.

1387
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:31,400
And then the emo, like the emo is named Yes.

1388
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:34,540
So people agreed with me.

1389
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:37,780
It's just, it's just, it's just nodding.

1390
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:39,740
It's a nodding emo.

1391
00:51:39,740 --> 00:51:42,480
What if they literally just give you the vehicle?

1392
00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:45,720
Remove cars from the rest of the... and then I voted no.

1393
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:49,560
I voted no.

1394
00:51:49,660 --> 00:51:50,040
I voted no.

1395
00:51:50,180 --> 00:51:51,600
Because I wanted...

1396
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:53,800
I'm voting no for you.

1397
00:51:53,940 --> 00:51:54,920
I'm voting no for you.

1398
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:56,200
Because I never got a chance.

1399
00:52:01,290 --> 00:52:05,050
What if only I get the car though?

1400
00:52:10,510 --> 00:52:12,830
As the team that's last place.

1401
00:52:15,870 --> 00:52:18,310
That should be my crutch.

1402
00:52:25,830 --> 00:52:26,730
Wait, what?

1403
00:52:27,430 --> 00:52:28,670
No, that's a joke.

1404
00:52:30,690 --> 00:52:32,730
I got the very, very end of that.

1405
00:52:32,950 --> 00:52:33,990
I was like, wait.

1406
00:52:33,990 --> 00:52:35,990
No, Sean, someone said that.

1407
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:46,760
Oh my God.

1408
00:52:46,820 --> 00:52:48,240
I can't believe it.

1409
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:50,460
Nobody.

1410
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:55,140
32 people voted yes to banning cars.

1411
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:56,000
That's not fair.

1412
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:57,200
That was me.

1413
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:58,220
That was me.

1414
00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:00,080
I voted for us.

1415
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:02,480
Dang.

1416
00:53:02,660 --> 00:53:03,520
Everyone really do.

1417
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:05,100
You should just let me have the car.

1418
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:06,380
No, I want the vehicle.

1419
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:10,920
Make it fair.

1420
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:13,600
I...

1421
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:14,620
Come on.

1422
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:16,720
What?

1423
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:20,060
Me having a special...

1424
00:53:20,860 --> 00:53:25,600
Me having a special privilege makes it fair.

1425
00:53:28,580 --> 00:53:30,120
Is this called a Doki roll?

1426
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:32,100
Yeah, it would be so funny.

1427
00:53:32,860 --> 00:53:34,560
They don't know what content is.

1428
00:53:37,180 --> 00:53:38,040
I love how.

1429
00:53:38,260 --> 00:53:41,840
Like, even though I, I'm not a fan of like vehicle chaos.

1430
00:53:41,840 --> 00:53:46,120
I actually don't mind it in a dumb tournament like this.

1431
00:53:46,300 --> 00:53:48,140
I'm totally open for it.

1432
00:53:48,140 --> 00:53:48,980
Yeah, everybody wins anyway.

1433
00:53:49,860 --> 00:53:51,100
Yeah, everyone's gonna win.

1434
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:52,860
Everybody's gonna have money.

1435
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:57,760
It'll be fine.

1436
00:53:58,260 --> 00:53:59,100
It'll be okay.

1437
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:02,620
No, I need to win 20 more dollars.

1438
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:04,900
Oh wait, that's true.

1439
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:10,160
Is it like the next placement is just like 20 or 50 more dollars or something?

1440
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:12,940
Wait, for game two, no special rules restrictions.

1441
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:15,920
Cars are not allowed for the rest of the games.

1442
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:16,640
No!

1443
00:54:17,060 --> 00:54:17,620
No!

1444
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:19,200
No!

1445
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:21,600
This is not fair.

1446
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:25,200
This should be illegal.

1447
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:29,520
I wonder like if the medallions are still gonna be a thing.

1448
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:34,920
I think the medallions aren't allowed on like two of the matches?

1449
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:36,360
This is rigged.

1450
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:39,440
This is rigged against me.

1451
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:40,140
I feel it.

1452
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:40,300
I feel it.

1453
00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:43,980
Oh, they literally just edited the rules too.

1454
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:44,920
Yeah, yeah.

1455
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:50,120
Oh, so that's... Okay, so game two is just gonna be like...

1456
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:51,200
What?

1457
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:52,480
What are they doing for game two then?

1458
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:54,580
Wait, what?

1459
00:54:54,940 --> 00:54:57,680
Wait, isn't game two mostly cars?

1460
00:54:58,320 --> 00:54:58,760
Yeah.

1461
00:54:58,800 --> 00:54:59,600
Oh, there we go.

1462
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:01,960
Wait, they turned off the safety zone?

1463
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:04,460
Wait, they turned off the safe zone?

1464
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:05,960
Wait, what?

1465
00:55:09,490 --> 00:55:09,930
Uh...

1466
00:55:11,530 --> 00:55:13,470
I like how all they did was ask about vehicles.

1467
00:55:14,290 --> 00:55:16,590
And then they like removed all the rules.

1468
00:55:17,170 --> 00:55:18,290
I'm so confused.

1469
00:55:18,770 --> 00:55:20,310
This has been the most confus...

1470
00:55:20,310 --> 00:55:23,670
Actually, no, this has not been the most confusing Twitch Rivals I've had.

1471
00:55:23,770 --> 00:55:25,230
I've had more confusing ones.

1472
00:55:25,570 --> 00:55:26,390
I was about to say no.

1473
00:55:26,590 --> 00:55:27,310
No, I meant...

1474
00:55:27,310 --> 00:55:28,930
There's Apex Rivals.

1475
00:55:29,090 --> 00:55:31,030
Apex Rivals is a whole different beast.

1476
00:55:31,310 --> 00:55:32,810
I've had more confusing ones.

1477
00:55:33,530 --> 00:55:35,110
I can't believe it.

1478
00:55:35,190 --> 00:55:36,390
I can't believe it.

1479
00:55:36,450 --> 00:55:38,090
These rules are against me.

1480
00:55:39,570 --> 00:55:40,410
I'm gonna...

1481
00:55:40,410 --> 00:55:43,710
I'm gonna find out who that guy was, who that car was, and report him again.

1482
00:55:49,210 --> 00:55:51,070
All in favor of reporting.

1483
00:55:51,610 --> 00:55:52,910
He did this to me.

1484
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:54,350
I was so...

1485
00:55:54,350 --> 00:55:55,430
I was gonna look for...

1486
00:55:55,430 --> 00:55:57,330
I was so looking forward to having a car.

1487
00:55:58,530 --> 00:55:59,130
You know what?

1488
00:55:59,170 --> 00:55:59,910
Everything was chill.

1489
00:56:00,050 --> 00:56:01,890
And then you saw them, Tina, and you're like, what?

1490
00:56:04,070 --> 00:56:04,530
It

1491
00:56:08,300 --> 00:56:09,560
would've been so fun!

1492
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:12,520
Can you imagine if like we actually like...

1493
00:56:12,520 --> 00:56:14,160
played a way where we could just...

1494
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:15,640
get into an enemy's vehicle?

1495
00:56:15,900 --> 00:56:16,240
Yeah!

1496
00:56:16,260 --> 00:56:18,120
It would've been so fun!

1497
00:56:18,940 --> 00:56:20,580
They're ruining my fun!

1498
00:56:22,020 --> 00:56:23,220
I was so excited.

1499
00:56:23,220 --> 00:56:23,600
I'm actually sad.

1500
00:56:23,940 --> 00:56:26,400
I was so fucking excited too.

1501
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:27,580
I was like, oh my god.

1502
00:56:27,620 --> 00:56:31,380
I'm gonna fucking get into somebody's car after what I saw.

1503
00:56:35,820 --> 00:56:37,840
Oh, big sadge.

1504
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:39,080
Big sadge.

1505
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:41,300
This is a conspiracy.

1506
00:56:41,820 --> 00:56:43,860
They did this purposely against me.

1507
00:56:43,860 --> 00:56:44,900
They knew I was so happy.

1508
00:56:45,060 --> 00:56:47,500
They knew I was gonna be so happy having a car.

1509
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:49,680
And?

1510
00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:52,640
They're like, Doki, happiness?

1511
00:56:53,700 --> 00:56:54,140
Never!

1512
00:56:55,780 --> 00:56:58,240
We're gonna get rid of everything she loves about Fortnite.

1513
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:02,540
You and I are literally both the same.

1514
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:04,460
I'm just like, just make the game crazy.

1515
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:06,780
Literally, add in all the mythics.

1516
00:57:06,860 --> 00:57:07,260
Like...

1517
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:09,820
Let everyone go wild with it.

1518
00:57:10,060 --> 00:57:10,740
It's not...

1519
00:57:10,740 --> 00:57:11,200
I...

1520
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:12,900
Isn't like FNCS...

1521
00:57:12,900 --> 00:57:15,680
You win more money in FNCS than you do Twitch Rivals.

1522
00:57:15,980 --> 00:57:17,240
Oh, you definitely do.

1523
00:57:17,380 --> 00:57:17,520
Yeah.

1524
00:57:18,020 --> 00:57:19,460
Why are you so serious here?

1525
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:23,960
Because that's how Fortnite players are.

1526
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:26,120
They're like, I need to take every mode seriously.

1527
00:57:26,460 --> 00:57:27,540
It's a game for children.

1528
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:31,600
This game was originally made for children.

1529
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:32,600
Like...

1530
00:57:33,460 --> 00:57:37,360
A fucking 14-year-old kid won a Fortnite championship.

1531
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:38,480
Like...

1532
00:57:41,340 --> 00:57:44,240
I was literally just telling my chat, I was like...

1533
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:47,400
This game is the best when it's just chaotic.

1534
00:57:48,020 --> 00:57:52,580
And then it gets turned into condom skin wearing simulator.

1535
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:57,680
This game was literally originally made for kids.

1536
00:57:58,680 --> 00:58:00,100
Why are they like this?

1537
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:02,500
Why are they like...

1538
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:06,980
Oh, yeah.

1539
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:07,580
You crap.

1540
00:58:07,580 --> 00:58:08,580
You fucking...

1541
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:12,000
We're like, everyone's going to know who we are at this point.

1542
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:12,440
But...

1543
00:58:12,440 --> 00:58:12,840
Yeah.

1544
00:58:12,940 --> 00:58:16,060
We're like, they're the only one with actual skins.

1545
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:21,440
I should change my stream title to the only team with skins.

1546
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:24,160
All right.

1547
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:24,600
Where are we going?

1548
00:58:24,820 --> 00:58:25,060
We're lighting here.

1549
00:58:25,220 --> 00:58:25,780
We're lighting here.

1550
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:27,280
The Grim Gate.

1551
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:29,240
Oh, the one with the speedy.

1552
00:58:29,660 --> 00:58:30,020
Yeah.

1553
00:58:30,020 --> 00:58:31,300
It's where all the Baja Blast is.

1554
00:58:31,380 --> 00:58:31,420
The Baja Blast.

1555
00:58:31,420 --> 00:58:31,460
Yeah.

1556
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:32,280
The Baja Blast.

1557
00:58:32,460 --> 00:58:32,480
Yeah.

1558
00:58:32,940 --> 00:58:35,940
We're going to get Baja Blast and it's going to be with us all game.

1559
00:58:36,120 --> 00:58:36,800
Until we use it.

1560
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:37,560
Until we use it.

1561
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:41,100
Or if the zone pulls here, which is very possible.

1562
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:42,360
All right.

1563
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:43,000
Drop now.

1564
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:44,280
Nice.

1565
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:45,240
Whee!

1566
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:47,300
Are you using the Wacking Playbill too, man?

1567
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:47,940
Yeah.

1568
00:58:47,940 --> 00:58:48,120
Yeah.

1569
00:58:48,140 --> 00:58:48,320
Yeah.

1570
00:58:48,460 --> 00:58:52,080
Like I said, I don't have any like cool gliders or...

1571
00:58:52,080 --> 00:58:52,660
No.

1572
00:58:52,660 --> 00:58:53,320
That one's amazing.

1573
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:54,180
I love that one.

1574
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:55,340
That's like...

1575
00:58:55,340 --> 00:58:56,800
That's my only cool one.

1576
00:58:56,900 --> 00:58:58,160
All the other ones are boring.

1577
00:59:01,300 --> 00:59:01,780
All right.

1578
00:59:01,780 --> 00:59:02,780
Are we going to pass it?

1579
00:59:03,420 --> 00:59:04,280
There's no way.

1580
00:59:04,380 --> 00:59:05,500
We had drops.

1581
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:06,000
We had drops.

1582
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:07,540
We had drops.

1583
00:59:07,540 --> 00:59:08,300
We called it out.

1584
00:59:08,580 --> 00:59:08,800
We called it out.

1585
00:59:08,940 --> 00:59:10,740
I think we're getting...

1586
00:59:10,740 --> 00:59:11,060
Wait.

1587
00:59:11,160 --> 00:59:12,260
Why is there one person here?

1588
00:59:12,900 --> 00:59:14,080
What the fuck is wrong with them?

1589
00:59:14,120 --> 00:59:14,200
Yeah.

1590
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:15,180
They're like landing right there.

1591
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:15,440
Yeah.

1592
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:15,660
Yeah.

1593
00:59:15,660 --> 00:59:16,520
They're landing with us.

1594
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:17,160
I see it.

1595
00:59:17,380 --> 00:59:17,920
All right.

1596
00:59:17,940 --> 00:59:20,060
Well, let's get looted and then we're going to have to fight them.

1597
00:59:20,060 --> 00:59:20,360
My God.

1598
00:59:21,460 --> 00:59:21,900
Fucking...

1599
00:59:22,580 --> 00:59:23,660
They're condom men.

1600
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:26,420
They're condom men though.

1601
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:27,860
I'm scared.

1602
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:30,700
Oh, it's the God dang condom men.

1603
00:59:33,540 --> 00:59:34,420
All right.

1604
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:35,540
Well, I got a shotgun.

1605
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:36,740
I got a Thunder Burst.

1606
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:37,180
I got a Thunder Burst.

1607
00:59:37,180 --> 00:59:37,520
I got a Thunder Burst.

1608
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:38,440
I got a shotgun too.

1609
00:59:38,540 --> 00:59:38,840
There's shields here.

1610
00:59:39,660 --> 00:59:39,980
Okay.

1611
00:59:40,020 --> 00:59:40,500
I need that.

1612
00:59:41,580 --> 00:59:42,780
Are you going to hit them together?

1613
00:59:43,240 --> 00:59:43,620
All right.

1614
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:44,000
I'm here.

1615
00:59:44,980 --> 00:59:45,300
Okay.

1616
00:59:45,740 --> 00:59:46,280
Let's hit these.

1617
00:59:47,840 --> 00:59:49,640
I'm going to hit the ground so that way it gets both of us.

1618
00:59:49,700 --> 00:59:50,800
And then I'm going to get the other one here.

1619
00:59:55,780 --> 00:59:57,040
Then we'll get the last one here.

1620
00:59:57,740 --> 00:59:58,200
All right.

1621
00:59:59,820 --> 01:00:00,460
All right.

1622
01:00:00,540 --> 01:00:00,860
Perfect.

1623
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:01,560
Nice.

1624
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:01,920
Okay.

1625
01:00:01,980 --> 01:00:02,140
Cool.

1626
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:02,900
So we got that.

1627
01:00:03,020 --> 01:00:04,660
And then there's bubbles here as well.

1628
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:05,380
All right.

1629
01:00:08,380 --> 01:00:09,060
All right.

1630
01:00:09,100 --> 01:00:09,120
All right.

1631
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:09,780
So...

1632
01:00:09,780 --> 01:00:10,500
I'm scared.

1633
01:00:10,700 --> 01:00:12,780
They're probably going to be playing on height.

1634
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:13,980
We have to worry about them.

1635
01:00:14,860 --> 01:00:15,340
Oh my...

1636
01:00:16,140 --> 01:00:17,540
And you should take the big shield.

1637
01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:18,820
Oh, no, no.

1638
01:00:18,820 --> 01:00:19,140
You take it.

1639
01:00:19,180 --> 01:00:19,400
You take it.

1640
01:00:19,420 --> 01:00:19,540
Take it.

1641
01:00:19,780 --> 01:00:20,120
Okay.

1642
01:00:20,500 --> 01:00:21,580
I'll just drink it now.

1643
01:00:21,820 --> 01:00:23,240
I'm just going to watch for them.

1644
01:00:24,940 --> 01:00:25,900
I don't know where they are.

1645
01:00:25,980 --> 01:00:26,880
That's what scares me.

1646
01:00:28,080 --> 01:00:28,420
Same.

1647
01:00:28,660 --> 01:00:30,280
There's probably one on top of the roof.

1648
01:00:30,420 --> 01:00:32,420
I'm just going to be on the lookout for.

1649
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:35,360
Here, let's touch the Baja Blast if we haven't touched it.

1650
01:00:35,380 --> 01:00:35,620
We haven't touched it yet?

1651
01:00:35,780 --> 01:00:36,340
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1652
01:00:36,940 --> 01:00:38,400
We touched the Baja Blast.

1653
01:00:38,560 --> 01:00:39,700
We got the Baja Blast.

1654
01:00:39,980 --> 01:00:41,120
And then I'm going to nitrous.

1655
01:00:41,180 --> 01:00:43,540
That way we can get the other heals here.

1656
01:00:43,740 --> 01:00:44,080
Actually, wait.

1657
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:44,320
We can just probably...

1658
01:00:44,320 --> 01:00:44,500
No.

1659
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:45,540
That's the NPC.

1660
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:49,680
Did they remove the safe zone?

1661
01:00:50,740 --> 01:00:51,100
Yeah.

1662
01:00:51,180 --> 01:00:51,760
They removed it.

1663
01:00:51,840 --> 01:00:51,920
Yeah.

1664
01:00:52,660 --> 01:00:53,020
Okay.

1665
01:00:53,260 --> 01:00:55,740
I think it's just everyone playing like normal right now.

1666
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:56,240
What?

1667
01:00:56,480 --> 01:00:58,800
Oh my...

1668
01:00:58,800 --> 01:00:59,420
Wait.

1669
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:00,440
They have these in?

1670
01:01:00,940 --> 01:01:01,480
What the fuck?

1671
01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:01,800
What is that?

1672
01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:03,900
Oh, isn't that the really overpowered shit?

1673
01:01:04,020 --> 01:01:04,840
Just use it.

1674
01:01:04,860 --> 01:01:05,160
Use it.

1675
01:01:05,160 --> 01:01:05,360
Use it.

1676
01:01:05,380 --> 01:01:05,580
Use it.

1677
01:01:05,640 --> 01:01:05,880
Use it real quick.

1678
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:06,560
They're above us.

1679
01:01:06,660 --> 01:01:06,920
They're above us.

1680
01:01:07,580 --> 01:01:07,940
Wait.

1681
01:01:08,060 --> 01:01:08,140
Wait.

1682
01:01:08,180 --> 01:01:08,740
Use it.

1683
01:01:08,860 --> 01:01:09,060
Use it.

1684
01:01:09,160 --> 01:01:10,020
I don't know how to do...

1685
01:01:11,720 --> 01:01:12,260
It's all good.

1686
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:12,540
It's all good.

1687
01:01:12,740 --> 01:01:13,100
Okay.

1688
01:01:13,160 --> 01:01:14,280
They're definitely over here though.

1689
01:01:14,540 --> 01:01:15,200
What do I do?

1690
01:01:16,100 --> 01:01:17,720
I think you just summon a thing.

1691
01:01:17,940 --> 01:01:18,400
Like a...

1692
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:19,000
Right now?

1693
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:20,080
A ship.

1694
01:01:20,100 --> 01:01:20,240
Yeah.

1695
01:01:20,320 --> 01:01:20,800
Just do it.

1696
01:01:21,060 --> 01:01:21,920
Do towards them here.

1697
01:01:22,680 --> 01:01:23,220
This way?

1698
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:24,080
Yeah.

1699
01:01:24,820 --> 01:01:25,180
Boom!

1700
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:27,880
Goodbye.

1701
01:01:30,040 --> 01:01:31,000
Did we do it?

1702
01:01:31,480 --> 01:01:32,200
Yeah, you did.

1703
01:01:33,300 --> 01:01:33,680
Did we?

1704
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:34,140
Yeah.

1705
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:35,280
They're above us right now.

1706
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:35,800
They're above us.

1707
01:01:35,840 --> 01:01:35,920
Okay.

1708
01:01:36,200 --> 01:01:36,560
Okay.

1709
01:01:37,700 --> 01:01:38,500
Want to do it again?

1710
01:01:39,060 --> 01:01:39,460
All right.

1711
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:40,580
I don't have one.

1712
01:01:40,660 --> 01:01:41,280
Are you going to wake up on us, I think?

1713
01:01:42,300 --> 01:01:44,240
That was literally the only thing I had.

1714
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:45,940
Oh, really?

1715
01:01:46,060 --> 01:01:47,240
Oh, it's only a one use.

1716
01:01:47,240 --> 01:01:47,560
Yeah.

1717
01:01:47,560 --> 01:01:48,880
There's only one use.

1718
01:01:49,320 --> 01:01:49,680
They're below.

1719
01:01:49,840 --> 01:01:50,740
They're right below here.

1720
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:51,140
They're right here.

1721
01:01:56,520 --> 01:01:57,000
All right.

1722
01:01:57,160 --> 01:01:57,780
138 on one.

1723
01:01:58,200 --> 01:01:58,560
Oh.

1724
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:00,040
Here?

1725
01:02:00,700 --> 01:02:01,560
109 on another.

1726
01:02:03,700 --> 01:02:04,460
They backed off.

1727
01:02:04,540 --> 01:02:04,960
They backed off.

1728
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:05,020
Okay.

1729
01:02:05,380 --> 01:02:06,200
I'm messing them up.

1730
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:07,020
They're pretty scared.

1731
01:02:07,420 --> 01:02:08,060
Well, that's good.

1732
01:02:08,060 --> 01:02:08,440
That's good.

1733
01:02:08,660 --> 01:02:08,980
Okay.

1734
01:02:09,700 --> 01:02:10,960
I'm going to fully heal this.

1735
01:02:11,720 --> 01:02:13,240
I'm going to get some Baja Blast, too.

1736
01:02:13,660 --> 01:02:14,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1737
01:02:14,180 --> 01:02:14,820
Get some Baja Blast.

1738
01:02:20,850 --> 01:02:21,310
All right.

1739
01:02:21,330 --> 01:02:22,410
I got some Nitro still.

1740
01:02:22,830 --> 01:02:23,270
All right.

1741
01:02:23,390 --> 01:02:24,690
I'm trying to see where these guys are.

1742
01:02:25,350 --> 01:02:26,190
Oh, that's scary.

1743
01:02:27,970 --> 01:02:30,150
We can go to the top of the roof here.

1744
01:02:30,190 --> 01:02:30,650
Let's go up.

1745
01:02:30,690 --> 01:02:31,130
Let's go up.

1746
01:02:31,650 --> 01:02:31,670
Okay.

1747
01:02:33,990 --> 01:02:36,410
Oh, I see them.

1748
01:02:36,410 --> 01:02:37,810
They are all the way out here.

1749
01:02:38,350 --> 01:02:38,670
Yep.

1750
01:02:38,690 --> 01:02:39,450
They're back here.

1751
01:02:41,090 --> 01:02:41,410
Careful.

1752
01:02:41,530 --> 01:02:41,710
I see them.

1753
01:02:41,710 --> 01:02:41,810
I see them.

1754
01:02:42,190 --> 01:02:42,470
Oh.

1755
01:02:44,230 --> 01:02:45,070
Did they break this?

1756
01:02:45,210 --> 01:02:45,590
Oh, okay.

1757
01:02:45,950 --> 01:02:46,750
I'm getting on the rooftop.

1758
01:02:51,170 --> 01:02:51,930
They're just jumping.

1759
01:02:53,430 --> 01:02:54,150
I'm going to get an angle.

1760
01:02:55,870 --> 01:02:57,050
They're trying to break my pillar.

1761
01:02:57,150 --> 01:02:57,430
Oh, I see.

1762
01:02:57,490 --> 01:02:57,730
I see them.

1763
01:02:58,050 --> 01:02:58,330
Yeah.

1764
01:02:58,350 --> 01:02:58,870
They're right here.

1765
01:03:01,190 --> 01:03:01,470
Looking.

1766
01:03:02,390 --> 01:03:04,430
I'm trying to play angles where we don't get shot in the back.

1767
01:03:06,230 --> 01:03:06,930
That's fucked up.

1768
01:03:06,950 --> 01:03:08,390
They won't let me drive a car, but I can...

1769
01:03:08,390 --> 01:03:08,650
Whoa!

1770
01:03:09,390 --> 01:03:10,190
I got shot in the side.

1771
01:03:10,230 --> 01:03:10,930
I got shot in the side.

1772
01:03:10,970 --> 01:03:11,470
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1773
01:03:11,490 --> 01:03:11,930
Come inside.

1774
01:03:11,950 --> 01:03:12,190
Come inside.

1775
01:03:12,550 --> 01:03:12,830
Yeah.

1776
01:03:13,310 --> 01:03:13,590
Okay.

1777
01:03:13,650 --> 01:03:13,930
Okay.

1778
01:03:16,550 --> 01:03:17,090
I'm okay.

1779
01:03:17,150 --> 01:03:17,370
I'm okay.

1780
01:03:17,890 --> 01:03:18,970
I don't know where I got shot.

1781
01:03:19,250 --> 01:03:20,070
I cracked this one.

1782
01:03:21,070 --> 01:03:21,770
126 on them.

1783
01:03:22,230 --> 01:03:22,870
Where is he?

1784
01:03:22,970 --> 01:03:23,130
Knocked him.

1785
01:03:23,550 --> 01:03:23,910
Nice.

1786
01:03:24,070 --> 01:03:24,630
Can you thirst him?

1787
01:03:24,690 --> 01:03:24,910
Or no?

1788
01:03:25,190 --> 01:03:25,550
Yeah.

1789
01:03:25,570 --> 01:03:26,010
I'm thirsting him.

1790
01:03:26,090 --> 01:03:26,390
Yep.

1791
01:03:26,450 --> 01:03:26,850
Thirsted him.

1792
01:03:27,190 --> 01:03:27,550
Nice.

1793
01:03:27,870 --> 01:03:28,670
We got a kill.

1794
01:03:28,850 --> 01:03:29,270
Let's go.

1795
01:03:29,650 --> 01:03:30,010
Yeah.

1796
01:03:30,010 --> 01:03:30,790
Get shit on.

1797
01:03:31,230 --> 01:03:31,590
Yeah.

1798
01:03:32,710 --> 01:03:33,970
My bodyguard did it.

1799
01:03:35,670 --> 01:03:36,030
Yeah.

1800
01:03:36,050 --> 01:03:37,150
We're going to cap your fucking body.

1801
01:03:37,270 --> 01:03:37,870
That's fucking right.

1802
01:03:37,870 --> 01:03:38,230
Yeah, fucker.

1803
01:03:38,730 --> 01:03:39,090
Yeah.

1804
01:03:39,970 --> 01:03:41,030
That's fucking right.

1805
01:03:41,770 --> 01:03:43,350
They were trying to be all sneaky and stuff.

1806
01:03:43,390 --> 01:03:44,330
That was actually the same team.

1807
01:03:45,630 --> 01:03:45,950
Yeah.

1808
01:03:46,070 --> 01:03:46,250
Yeah.

1809
01:03:46,370 --> 01:03:46,550
Yeah.

1810
01:03:46,550 --> 01:03:47,510
What's the Iron Warrior?

1811
01:03:47,770 --> 01:03:49,870
Is the Iron Warrior better than the laser?

1812
01:03:50,990 --> 01:03:51,310
Oh.

1813
01:03:51,430 --> 01:03:52,190
Is people flying?

1814
01:03:52,270 --> 01:03:52,790
Flying over here?

1815
01:03:53,070 --> 01:03:53,390
Careful.

1816
01:03:53,490 --> 01:03:53,650
Careful.

1817
01:03:53,650 --> 01:03:53,710
Careful.

1818
01:03:53,710 --> 01:03:53,790
Careful.

1819
01:03:53,790 --> 01:03:54,030
Oh shit.

1820
01:03:54,090 --> 01:03:54,390
Oh shit.

1821
01:03:54,610 --> 01:03:54,830
Yeah.

1822
01:03:54,850 --> 01:03:54,930
Yeah.

1823
01:03:54,950 --> 01:03:55,410
Go inside.

1824
01:03:55,530 --> 01:03:55,710
Go inside.

1825
01:03:55,750 --> 01:03:55,910
Go inside.

1826
01:03:56,870 --> 01:03:57,470
I'm trying to.

1827
01:03:57,830 --> 01:03:58,150
Whoa.

1828
01:03:58,250 --> 01:03:58,430
Whoa.

1829
01:03:58,450 --> 01:03:58,630
Whoa.

1830
01:03:58,630 --> 01:03:58,870
Whoa.

1831
01:03:58,870 --> 01:03:59,010
Whoa.

1832
01:03:59,010 --> 01:03:59,150
Whoa.

1833
01:03:59,150 --> 01:03:59,270
Whoa.

1834
01:03:59,330 --> 01:03:59,350
Whoa.

1835
01:03:59,550 --> 01:03:59,870
Whoa.

1836
01:03:59,870 --> 01:04:00,410
I'm trying to get an angle.

1837
01:04:00,510 --> 01:04:00,970
Trying to get an angle.

1838
01:04:01,250 --> 01:04:02,150
They're chasing, I think.

1839
01:04:02,250 --> 01:04:02,490
Yeah.

1840
01:04:02,490 --> 01:04:03,050
Oh, they got me.

1841
01:04:03,110 --> 01:04:03,550
They got me.

1842
01:04:03,710 --> 01:04:04,490
Is that a new team?

1843
01:04:04,910 --> 01:04:05,530
It's a new team.

1844
01:04:05,570 --> 01:04:05,970
It's a new team.

1845
01:04:06,030 --> 01:04:06,110
Oh, please.

1846
01:04:06,170 --> 01:04:06,430
Run.

1847
01:04:06,530 --> 01:04:06,690
Run.

1848
01:04:06,730 --> 01:04:07,370
It's the condom.

1849
01:04:07,370 --> 01:04:08,010
Just leave me.

1850
01:04:08,330 --> 01:04:09,050
Just leave me.

1851
01:04:09,050 --> 01:04:09,970
It's the condoms.

1852
01:04:10,430 --> 01:04:10,930
I'm going.

1853
01:04:11,350 --> 01:04:11,970
Just leave.

1854
01:04:12,970 --> 01:04:14,110
I never existed.

1855
01:04:16,830 --> 01:04:17,330
I'm going.

1856
01:04:17,370 --> 01:04:17,870
Just keep running.

1857
01:04:18,970 --> 01:04:19,330
No.

1858
01:04:19,650 --> 01:04:20,390
Just leave.

1859
01:04:21,190 --> 01:04:21,810
I'm living.

1860
01:04:22,810 --> 01:04:23,730
Oh my God.

1861
01:04:24,690 --> 01:04:25,470
Just keep living.

1862
01:04:26,710 --> 01:04:27,590
Are they still there?

1863
01:04:28,070 --> 01:04:28,890
I think so.

1864
01:04:28,930 --> 01:04:29,670
Oh my God.

1865
01:04:29,670 --> 01:04:30,910
Oh my God.

1866
01:04:31,690 --> 01:04:35,610
It sucks because I have no other mobility right now.

1867
01:04:35,830 --> 01:04:36,110
Yeah.

1868
01:04:37,330 --> 01:04:38,130
Except for...

1869
01:04:38,130 --> 01:04:38,750
Oh no.

1870
01:04:38,890 --> 01:04:39,410
Oh no.

1871
01:04:39,650 --> 01:04:40,490
I'm probably dead.

1872
01:04:40,650 --> 01:04:41,250
I think so.

1873
01:04:41,330 --> 01:04:41,930
I think so too.

1874
01:04:42,310 --> 01:04:43,130
I think so.

1875
01:04:44,750 --> 01:04:45,910
Oh my God.

1876
01:04:45,930 --> 01:04:47,370
See, you have to climb that.

1877
01:04:47,430 --> 01:04:48,690
It's hurting me right now.

1878
01:04:48,910 --> 01:04:49,930
I know, right?

1879
01:04:50,950 --> 01:04:51,430
See.

1880
01:04:51,510 --> 01:04:51,930
Oh my God.

1881
01:04:51,950 --> 01:04:52,550
I'm alive somehow.

1882
01:04:52,570 --> 01:04:53,470
Oh my God.

1883
01:04:53,790 --> 01:04:55,150
Never stop running.

1884
01:04:55,450 --> 01:04:56,690
I'm going to keep going.

1885
01:04:56,770 --> 01:04:57,370
I'm going to go.

1886
01:04:57,370 --> 01:04:57,790
Just keep going.

1887
01:04:58,090 --> 01:04:58,350
Wait.

1888
01:04:59,670 --> 01:04:59,830
Oh yeah.

1889
01:04:59,830 --> 01:05:00,070
Oh yeah.

1890
01:05:00,070 --> 01:05:00,190
They know you.

1891
01:05:00,190 --> 01:05:00,630
He will never know.

1892
01:05:01,130 --> 01:05:01,690
There'll never know.

1893
01:05:02,070 --> 01:05:02,810
Do you have...

1894
01:05:02,810 --> 01:05:03,830
You got bandages.

1895
01:05:04,890 --> 01:05:05,290
Yup.

1896
01:05:05,510 --> 01:05:08,810
I'm going to chill for a sec and wait to see if they fall out all the way.

1897
01:05:09,390 --> 01:05:10,330
I don't think they did.

1898
01:05:13,350 --> 01:05:14,250
I'm proud of us.

1899
01:05:14,270 --> 01:05:14,790
We got to kill.

1900
01:05:14,810 --> 01:05:15,630
Yeah, we got to kill.

1901
01:05:15,730 --> 01:05:16,850
We got to fucking kill.

1902
01:05:16,930 --> 01:05:17,630
We did it.

1903
01:05:20,290 --> 01:05:21,710
You got the kill.

1904
01:05:21,910 --> 01:05:23,170
We did it.

1905
01:05:28,470 --> 01:05:29,650
No, we did it.

1906
01:05:29,650 --> 01:05:30,310
We fucking did it.

1907
01:05:32,370 --> 01:05:34,450
Guys, I was a good bait.

1908
01:05:36,310 --> 01:05:37,130
I'm terrified.

1909
01:05:37,130 --> 01:05:39,110
I feel like they're gonna be on the outskirts here.

1910
01:05:39,390 --> 01:05:40,450
I feel like it too.

1911
01:05:41,430 --> 01:05:42,890
It's the condom people.

1912
01:05:43,530 --> 01:05:45,010
I can always...

1913
01:05:45,550 --> 01:05:47,430
I'm so annoyed that they have gloves.

1914
01:05:47,690 --> 01:05:49,170
I never get gloves.

1915
01:05:49,590 --> 01:05:51,030
Yeah, how do they get the gloves?

1916
01:05:51,650 --> 01:05:54,330
It's just RNG because there's no NPCs or anything.

1917
01:05:54,330 --> 01:05:54,790
Yeah, yeah.

1918
01:05:55,650 --> 01:06:00,170
I can't believe they, like, contested us.

1919
01:06:00,530 --> 01:06:01,570
I know, right?

1920
01:06:01,650 --> 01:06:02,050
Like, what?

1921
01:06:02,090 --> 01:06:02,450
Who are they?

1922
01:06:02,810 --> 01:06:04,610
Wait, what was the guy that we killed?

1923
01:06:05,770 --> 01:06:08,290
I think it was a name that started with an X, I think.

1924
01:06:08,430 --> 01:06:09,430
I'm gonna find you.

1925
01:06:10,430 --> 01:06:10,950
They're here.

1926
01:06:13,970 --> 01:06:14,790
There's someone here.

1927
01:06:15,230 --> 01:06:17,110
Did they hear that when you swapped guns?

1928
01:06:17,850 --> 01:06:19,710
They do, but I'm gonna go over here.

1929
01:06:20,030 --> 01:06:20,850
Oh my god, game.

1930
01:06:21,910 --> 01:06:23,650
Okay, we're good.

1931
01:06:24,470 --> 01:06:26,270
But what if they destroy your house?

1932
01:06:26,910 --> 01:06:27,770
I could die.

1933
01:06:28,150 --> 01:06:28,210
Oh, the medallion.

1934
01:06:28,410 --> 01:06:30,470
The medallion people, they're trying to find you.

1935
01:06:31,050 --> 01:06:31,770
Oh my god.

1936
01:06:33,330 --> 01:06:35,250
They'll never search here, right?

1937
01:06:36,770 --> 01:06:37,530
I don't know.

1938
01:06:37,950 --> 01:06:38,750
It's not fair.

1939
01:06:38,870 --> 01:06:40,610
They'll never search here.

1940
01:06:40,810 --> 01:06:41,250
There's two.

1941
01:06:41,790 --> 01:06:42,770
There's two of them.

1942
01:06:43,350 --> 01:06:44,630
I think they're trying to find each other.

1943
01:06:44,910 --> 01:06:46,390
I think they're trying to find each other.

1944
01:06:47,990 --> 01:06:48,590
Oh, wait.

1945
01:06:48,710 --> 01:06:50,150
Is there a vending machine here?

1946
01:06:50,230 --> 01:06:51,130
Oh, there's no vending machine.

1947
01:06:51,290 --> 01:06:53,450
I was gonna say, it can, like, use EMPs to...

1948
01:06:54,170 --> 01:06:54,730
get gold?

1949
01:06:54,950 --> 01:06:56,330
And then I can, like, full heal.

1950
01:06:56,770 --> 01:06:59,330
There's also a bunch of cactuses around here too I can use to heal.

1951
01:06:59,590 --> 01:07:00,210
Oh, they're leaving.

1952
01:07:00,350 --> 01:07:00,550
They're leaving.

1953
01:07:00,630 --> 01:07:00,850
They're leaving.

1954
01:07:00,970 --> 01:07:02,050
Yeah, I think they're converging.

1955
01:07:02,510 --> 01:07:03,870
Are they trying to chase each other?

1956
01:07:04,390 --> 01:07:05,070
I think they are.

1957
01:07:05,070 --> 01:07:05,450
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1958
01:07:05,450 --> 01:07:06,110
They're chasing each other.

1959
01:07:06,990 --> 01:07:08,170
Wait, I might be able to get your card.

1960
01:07:08,310 --> 01:07:08,810
I'm serious.

1961
01:07:09,550 --> 01:07:10,110
88 seconds?

1962
01:07:10,870 --> 01:07:11,150
Yeah.

1963
01:07:11,290 --> 01:07:12,110
I can actually go back.

1964
01:07:12,170 --> 01:07:13,470
Well, as long as these guys don't linger.

1965
01:07:14,830 --> 01:07:16,170
I don't think they are, right?

1966
01:07:16,990 --> 01:07:17,270
They're...

1967
01:07:17,270 --> 01:07:18,590
I don't know what they're doing.

1968
01:07:19,830 --> 01:07:20,430
Okay, yeah, yeah.

1969
01:07:20,430 --> 01:07:20,770
This is good.

1970
01:07:20,830 --> 01:07:21,050
This is good.

1971
01:07:21,210 --> 01:07:21,710
Wait, what happened?

1972
01:07:21,770 --> 01:07:22,210
Oh, they're gone.

1973
01:07:22,230 --> 01:07:22,490
They're gone.

1974
01:07:22,670 --> 01:07:22,950
Yeah.

1975
01:07:23,450 --> 01:07:24,550
Yeah, it's either all or nothing.

1976
01:07:24,710 --> 01:07:25,050
Like...

1977
01:07:25,730 --> 01:07:26,410
I'm gonna try.

1978
01:07:26,870 --> 01:07:27,670
70 seconds.

1979
01:07:28,590 --> 01:07:29,010
Oh.

1980
01:07:30,870 --> 01:07:31,290
Oh.

1981
01:07:31,330 --> 01:07:31,870
They're fighting?

1982
01:07:32,050 --> 01:07:32,770
Wait, the shotgun?

1983
01:07:32,770 --> 01:07:32,990
Okay.

1984
01:07:33,090 --> 01:07:33,770
They knocked somebody.

1985
01:07:34,170 --> 01:07:35,130
Yeah, they fenced someone.

1986
01:07:35,250 --> 01:07:36,350
My tail is so long.

1987
01:07:37,310 --> 01:07:39,350
I think they can see your tail.

1988
01:07:39,850 --> 01:07:41,610
They're gonna see your tail.

1989
01:07:42,190 --> 01:07:43,290
Oh, that's an NPC.

1990
01:07:45,630 --> 01:07:46,470
It's a condom skin.

1991
01:07:46,610 --> 01:07:46,930
We're good.

1992
01:07:47,010 --> 01:07:47,290
We're good.

1993
01:07:47,550 --> 01:07:48,250
We're good.

1994
01:07:48,850 --> 01:07:50,710
Oh, I don't think he can get me anymore.

1995
01:07:50,990 --> 01:07:51,690
No, I'm going.

1996
01:07:51,850 --> 01:07:51,950
I'm going.

1997
01:07:51,990 --> 01:07:52,210
I'm going.

1998
01:07:52,210 --> 01:07:52,530
No, no.

1999
01:07:52,530 --> 01:07:52,990
There's no way.

2000
01:07:53,050 --> 01:07:53,410
That's 45 seconds.

2001
01:07:53,410 --> 01:07:53,430
I'm going.

2002
01:07:53,450 --> 01:07:54,910
There's no way.

2003
01:07:55,010 --> 01:07:55,870
There's no way.

2004
01:07:55,910 --> 01:07:55,950
I'm going.

2005
01:07:56,090 --> 01:07:57,030
You don't have heals.

2006
01:07:57,490 --> 01:07:59,850
No, I got two bandages.

2007
01:08:00,150 --> 01:08:00,950
There's no way.

2008
01:08:01,030 --> 01:08:01,770
You're crazy.

2009
01:08:02,290 --> 01:08:03,370
We're doing this.

2010
01:08:03,630 --> 01:08:04,430
You're crazy.

2011
01:08:04,530 --> 01:08:05,950
You're gonna die in storm.

2012
01:08:06,110 --> 01:08:07,070
That's even worse.

2013
01:08:07,570 --> 01:08:08,090
No.

2014
01:08:08,530 --> 01:08:09,330
We're good.

2015
01:08:10,350 --> 01:08:11,470
27 seconds.

2016
01:08:12,490 --> 01:08:14,370
You're gonna die in storm, Doryu.

2017
01:08:14,450 --> 01:08:15,070
Like, 100.

2018
01:08:15,490 --> 01:08:15,550
No, no, no.

2019
01:08:15,570 --> 01:08:15,950
We can do it.

2020
01:08:16,190 --> 01:08:16,310
We can do it.

2021
01:08:16,310 --> 01:08:17,230
Are you sure?

2022
01:08:17,810 --> 01:08:18,370
Yup.

2023
01:08:18,410 --> 01:08:18,670
Yup.

2024
01:08:18,730 --> 01:08:18,930
Yup.

2025
01:08:18,930 --> 01:08:19,230
Okay.

2026
01:08:21,370 --> 01:08:22,490
60 seconds.

2027
01:08:22,870 --> 01:08:23,430
I'm going.

2028
01:08:23,430 --> 01:08:24,770
We're doing this.

2029
01:08:26,550 --> 01:08:26,950
We're doing this.

2030
01:08:27,290 --> 01:08:28,150
We're doing this.

2031
01:08:28,550 --> 01:08:28,950
9.

2032
01:08:29,670 --> 01:08:30,070
8.

2033
01:08:30,730 --> 01:08:31,130
7.

2034
01:08:31,470 --> 01:08:32,850
I got you.

2035
01:08:33,010 --> 01:08:33,570
We're good.

2036
01:08:33,730 --> 01:08:34,010
Okay.

2037
01:08:34,010 --> 01:08:34,890
But how are you gonna live?

2038
01:08:36,390 --> 01:08:37,230
That's a good question.

2039
01:08:37,310 --> 01:08:37,670
I don't know.

2040
01:08:38,210 --> 01:08:38,610
Okay.

2041
01:08:39,190 --> 01:08:39,590
Okay.

2042
01:08:39,850 --> 01:08:45,770
I literally said this is not a good idea because I don't think you're gonna live in the storm.

2043
01:08:46,290 --> 01:08:46,690
No.

2044
01:08:46,770 --> 01:08:48,330
The nice thing is there's a bunch of...

2045
01:08:48,970 --> 01:08:50,670
There's a bunch of cactuses I can heal on.

2046
01:08:50,870 --> 01:08:51,470
Oh, that's true.

2047
01:08:51,470 --> 01:08:51,770
Oh, my God.

2048
01:08:51,830 --> 01:08:52,410
There's pigs here.

2049
01:08:52,490 --> 01:08:52,870
There's pigs.

2050
01:08:52,870 --> 01:08:53,270
There's pigs.

2051
01:08:53,590 --> 01:08:53,990
Yes.

2052
01:08:55,210 --> 01:08:56,610
We got some bats.

2053
01:08:56,890 --> 01:08:57,630
We got shield bats.

2054
01:08:57,950 --> 01:08:57,990
Oh.

2055
01:09:00,710 --> 01:09:01,370
Just leave.

2056
01:09:01,370 --> 01:09:02,690
I don't think I need the EMPs.

2057
01:09:02,690 --> 01:09:04,130
I'm just gonna probably swap these.

2058
01:09:04,410 --> 01:09:05,350
Where's the cactuses?

2059
01:09:06,650 --> 01:09:07,050
Okay.

2060
01:09:07,050 --> 01:09:07,630
Let's grab that.

2061
01:09:07,750 --> 01:09:09,430
And then let's do this.

2062
01:09:10,350 --> 01:09:10,750
Oh.

2063
01:09:10,790 --> 01:09:11,790
I was hoping for a nitro.

2064
01:09:11,810 --> 01:09:12,210
Dang.

2065
01:09:12,430 --> 01:09:12,730
Okay.

2066
01:09:12,790 --> 01:09:13,150
All good.

2067
01:09:13,330 --> 01:09:14,170
Gonna grab those.

2068
01:09:14,470 --> 01:09:14,930
Oh, my God.

2069
01:09:14,970 --> 01:09:16,530
Doryu is stressing me out right now.

2070
01:09:16,610 --> 01:09:16,670
Okay.

2071
01:09:16,670 --> 01:09:16,850
You know what?

2072
01:09:16,870 --> 01:09:16,970
No.

2073
01:09:17,010 --> 01:09:17,530
Let's grab this.

2074
01:09:17,690 --> 01:09:18,150
Let's do that.

2075
01:09:19,630 --> 01:09:21,410
You're stressing me out right now.

2076
01:09:21,550 --> 01:09:22,390
Look at that.

2077
01:09:22,390 --> 01:09:23,190
Look at that right there.

2078
01:09:23,190 --> 01:09:24,150
Oh, thank God.

2079
01:09:24,250 --> 01:09:24,470
Okay.

2080
01:09:24,670 --> 01:09:24,990
Let's go.

2081
01:09:26,150 --> 01:09:29,490
I was like, I'm seeing those numbers go down.

2082
01:09:32,090 --> 01:09:34,310
I think it should be okay for a little bit.

2083
01:09:34,390 --> 01:09:38,650
He looks so carefree while in the storm.

2084
01:09:39,490 --> 01:09:40,630
I'm just like, oh.

2085
01:09:41,250 --> 01:09:41,730
Okay.

2086
01:09:41,830 --> 01:09:42,750
If you say so.

2087
01:09:43,170 --> 01:09:44,570
I want nitro.

2088
01:09:44,630 --> 01:09:45,850
I want nitro.

2089
01:09:46,070 --> 01:09:46,550
Guys.

2090
01:09:47,030 --> 01:09:50,150
Doryu needs somebody to gift him Discord Nitro, guys.

2091
01:09:50,490 --> 01:09:51,210
Can he get to this?

2092
01:09:51,210 --> 01:09:52,050
I need Discord Nitro.

2093
01:09:52,150 --> 01:09:52,370
Guys.

2094
01:09:52,390 --> 01:09:53,230
Any gifters in chat?

2095
01:09:55,290 --> 01:09:58,690
I wonder if I should revive you?

2096
01:10:00,590 --> 01:10:01,470
How far?

2097
01:10:01,910 --> 01:10:03,530
I mean, it's not that far.

2098
01:10:03,770 --> 01:10:04,070
It's pretty far.

2099
01:10:04,070 --> 01:10:04,310
Okay.

2100
01:10:04,430 --> 01:10:05,070
Maybe it is.

2101
01:10:05,090 --> 01:10:05,690
In the next zone?

2102
01:10:05,930 --> 01:10:06,190
Yeah.

2103
01:10:06,210 --> 01:10:07,450
Well, actually, we'll find on the next zone.

2104
01:10:11,630 --> 01:10:13,190
Do you have enough heals?

2105
01:10:15,010 --> 01:10:15,450
I'm gonna talk to this guy.

2106
01:10:16,310 --> 01:10:17,390
I'm gonna talk to this guy.

2107
01:10:17,450 --> 01:10:18,110
He might give me a med kit.

2108
01:10:18,850 --> 01:10:19,570
Oh, wait.

2109
01:10:19,630 --> 01:10:19,930
Gold?

2110
01:10:21,010 --> 01:10:21,790
And then...

2111
01:10:21,790 --> 01:10:22,050
Med kit?

2112
01:10:22,050 --> 01:10:22,410
No!

2113
01:10:22,910 --> 01:10:23,790
That's not med kit!

2114
01:10:23,930 --> 01:10:24,810
That's a shield cell.

2115
01:10:25,970 --> 01:10:26,390
Frick.

2116
01:10:26,410 --> 01:10:26,690
Okay.

2117
01:10:26,910 --> 01:10:29,810
I think you gotta go to zone at this point or find a cactus.

2118
01:10:31,270 --> 01:10:34,150
There may be a cactus on my right that might not be taken.

2119
01:10:34,910 --> 01:10:37,010
I was really hoping there'd be a vending machine here.

2120
01:10:37,750 --> 01:10:38,170
Oh.

2121
01:10:38,170 --> 01:10:38,490
Oh.

2122
01:10:39,190 --> 01:10:39,610
Yes.

2123
01:10:39,850 --> 01:10:40,870
Oh, thank God.

2124
01:10:41,530 --> 01:10:41,950
Yes.

2125
01:10:42,230 --> 01:10:43,290
Oh, thank God.

2126
01:10:43,370 --> 01:10:44,150
And there's a...

2127
01:10:44,150 --> 01:10:44,670
There's a...

2128
01:10:45,470 --> 01:10:46,430
There's a chest, too.

2129
01:10:46,850 --> 01:10:47,990
I think I might...

2130
01:10:47,990 --> 01:10:49,370
Oh, do I revive you?

2131
01:10:49,430 --> 01:10:50,850
I think I'm gonna try reviving you here.

2132
01:10:51,450 --> 01:10:52,030
There's an archer.

2133
01:10:52,050 --> 01:10:52,310
There's a cactus.

2134
01:10:53,610 --> 01:10:54,090
Nice.

2135
01:10:54,210 --> 01:10:54,990
We're living this.

2136
01:10:55,130 --> 01:10:55,690
We're living this.

2137
01:10:55,790 --> 01:10:56,390
Oh, you're still alive.

2138
01:10:57,070 --> 01:10:57,790
You're alive.

2139
01:10:57,810 --> 01:10:58,610
You're still alive.

2140
01:10:58,790 --> 01:11:00,490
I feel the life in you.

2141
01:11:03,010 --> 01:11:04,890
How has only...

2142
01:11:04,890 --> 01:11:05,690
There's...

2143
01:11:05,690 --> 01:11:06,190
Oh, my God.

2144
01:11:06,210 --> 01:11:07,630
There's so many people still alive.

2145
01:11:08,050 --> 01:11:08,530
Yeah.

2146
01:11:08,710 --> 01:11:12,510
That's like my only worry is that there's gonna be teams on the outskirts here, like...

2147
01:11:13,550 --> 01:11:15,410
I'm just kinda chilling out here.

2148
01:11:16,090 --> 01:11:16,490
Oh, my God.

2149
01:11:16,490 --> 01:11:17,790
There's definitely gonna be a team up there.

2150
01:11:17,790 --> 01:11:18,090
Yeah.

2151
01:11:18,210 --> 01:11:19,410
I'm gonna drop.

2152
01:11:21,550 --> 01:11:22,030
Oh, my God.

2153
01:11:23,870 --> 01:11:25,670
I'm not seeing this whole area yet.

2154
01:11:26,050 --> 01:11:27,730
Oh, it's the Pirates of the Caribbean area.

2155
01:11:28,130 --> 01:11:28,430
Yeah.

2156
01:11:28,430 --> 01:11:29,830
They literally just added it.

2157
01:11:29,990 --> 01:11:30,470
That's sick.

2158
01:11:32,690 --> 01:11:34,050
That's how we got our ghost ship.

2159
01:11:34,930 --> 01:11:36,270
I wish the ghost ship was...

2160
01:11:36,270 --> 01:11:39,290
I guess it was too broken for it to be like...

2161
01:11:39,290 --> 01:11:40,270
Do I rev you?

2162
01:11:40,590 --> 01:11:41,070
Do it.

2163
01:11:41,790 --> 01:11:42,930
It'll be so funny.

2164
01:11:43,270 --> 01:11:44,190
I wanna make sure...

2165
01:11:44,190 --> 01:11:45,010
Is there a team on the island?

2166
01:11:45,150 --> 01:11:45,830
There's no one up there.

2167
01:11:46,130 --> 01:11:47,230
It'll be so funny.

2168
01:11:47,310 --> 01:11:47,710
Do it.

2169
01:11:47,990 --> 01:11:48,590
You know what?

2170
01:11:48,650 --> 01:11:49,130
I'm doing it.

2171
01:11:49,230 --> 01:11:49,870
I'm doing it.

2172
01:11:49,930 --> 01:11:50,490
I'm doing it.

2173
01:11:50,490 --> 01:11:50,810
Fuck it.

2174
01:11:51,010 --> 01:11:51,410
Fuck it.

2175
01:11:51,510 --> 01:11:51,530
Yeah.

2176
01:11:51,530 --> 01:11:52,030
Bring back our team.

2177
01:11:52,030 --> 01:11:52,270
Isaac.

2178
01:11:53,590 --> 01:11:54,230
Fuck it.

2179
01:11:54,330 --> 01:11:54,970
Bring him back.

2180
01:11:57,110 --> 01:11:57,690
Oh, wait.

2181
01:11:57,730 --> 01:11:59,210
This one is faster.

2182
01:12:01,870 --> 01:12:02,870
Oh, this one?

2183
01:12:03,070 --> 01:12:03,290
Yeah.

2184
01:12:03,830 --> 01:12:05,870
The reboot seems a lot faster than usual.

2185
01:12:07,110 --> 01:12:07,510
Okay.

2186
01:12:07,550 --> 01:12:09,990
We're gonna have a team definitely like waiting for us on the outside.

2187
01:12:11,050 --> 01:12:12,710
But I have bubbles ready.

2188
01:12:12,790 --> 01:12:12,890
I know.

2189
01:12:12,890 --> 01:12:13,150
Shenron's here.

2190
01:12:13,750 --> 01:12:15,050
And then there's shields here.

2191
01:12:15,070 --> 01:12:16,690
And then we have a bunch of cactus we can hit too.

2192
01:12:16,970 --> 01:12:17,350
Nice.

2193
01:12:17,490 --> 01:12:17,790
All right.

2194
01:12:18,010 --> 01:12:18,410
Here.

2195
01:12:18,470 --> 01:12:19,510
I'm gonna split these with you.

2196
01:12:19,590 --> 01:12:21,330
And I'm gonna drop you one of these.

2197
01:12:21,610 --> 01:12:22,010
Nice.

2198
01:12:22,370 --> 01:12:23,090
I'm gonna pop that.

2199
01:12:23,350 --> 01:12:24,230
I'm popping it.

2200
01:12:24,830 --> 01:12:25,190
That's right.

2201
01:12:25,190 --> 01:12:25,910
Do you want a sniper rifle?

2202
01:12:26,090 --> 01:12:26,830
Do you want a long range?

2203
01:12:27,150 --> 01:12:28,490
I can find a gun.

2204
01:12:28,570 --> 01:12:29,410
There's some guns.

2205
01:12:29,510 --> 01:12:29,890
It's all right.

2206
01:12:30,410 --> 01:12:30,770
Okay.

2207
01:12:30,930 --> 01:12:31,290
Here.

2208
01:12:31,370 --> 01:12:31,710
Let's hit this.

2209
01:12:33,330 --> 01:12:33,690
Yay.

2210
01:12:35,010 --> 01:12:35,470
I'm back.

2211
01:12:35,550 --> 01:12:36,350
Then let's start going.

2212
01:12:39,010 --> 01:12:39,710
What's that sound?

2213
01:12:40,070 --> 01:12:40,990
Those are teams rotating.

2214
01:12:41,250 --> 01:12:42,470
Oh, there's a gun right here.

2215
01:12:42,970 --> 01:12:43,330
Shotgun?

2216
01:12:44,370 --> 01:12:44,730
No.

2217
01:12:44,810 --> 01:12:44,970
It's...

2218
01:12:45,590 --> 01:12:46,130
That's fine.

2219
01:12:46,230 --> 01:12:47,230
I don't want to risk it.

2220
01:12:47,830 --> 01:12:48,190
Here.

2221
01:12:48,210 --> 01:12:49,070
Let me give you my gun then.

2222
01:12:49,170 --> 01:12:50,270
Because I already have a really good gun.

2223
01:12:50,350 --> 01:12:50,630
So.

2224
01:12:50,670 --> 01:12:51,030
Okay.

2225
01:12:51,050 --> 01:12:51,370
I'll give you this.

2226
01:12:51,630 --> 01:12:51,990
Okay.

2227
01:12:52,010 --> 01:12:52,530
I'm gonna...

2228
01:12:52,530 --> 01:12:52,630
Whoa!

2229
01:12:53,910 --> 01:12:55,110
What the fuck?

2230
01:12:55,390 --> 01:12:55,810
Okay.

2231
01:12:56,510 --> 01:12:56,950
Somebody's gonna...

2232
01:12:57,190 --> 01:12:57,970
Somebody's gonna...

2233
01:12:57,970 --> 01:12:58,010
Alright.

2234
01:12:58,010 --> 01:12:58,770
Smoke those dudes.

2235
01:12:59,390 --> 01:13:01,710
Another team is gonna kill me to get that gun.

2236
01:13:02,030 --> 01:13:03,030
Are you sure?

2237
01:13:03,190 --> 01:13:03,790
I don't know.

2238
01:13:03,790 --> 01:13:04,090
Yes.

2239
01:13:04,090 --> 01:13:04,650
I'm sure.

2240
01:13:04,710 --> 01:13:04,870
I'm sure.

2241
01:13:04,870 --> 01:13:07,410
I don't know if I should have this gun right now.

2242
01:13:07,710 --> 01:13:08,510
I believe...

2243
01:13:08,510 --> 01:13:09,610
I don't know.

2244
01:13:09,950 --> 01:13:10,390
Okay.

2245
01:13:10,390 --> 01:13:15,450
Just make sure you have the Gibby dome ready for if we have any teams that try to like rotate on us.

2246
01:13:15,750 --> 01:13:16,030
Yeah.

2247
01:13:16,870 --> 01:13:17,750
Of course.

2248
01:13:17,830 --> 01:13:19,430
It's a zone all the way up there.

2249
01:13:19,850 --> 01:13:20,290
Wait.

2250
01:13:20,330 --> 01:13:20,470
What?

2251
01:13:22,010 --> 01:13:22,490
You have one more.

2252
01:13:22,570 --> 01:13:22,910
You have one more.

2253
01:13:23,170 --> 01:13:23,490
Yeah.

2254
01:13:23,510 --> 01:13:24,710
This game is so buggy.

2255
01:13:24,770 --> 01:13:25,850
I didn't even like burn one.

2256
01:13:26,050 --> 01:13:27,110
But it like used it.

2257
01:13:29,270 --> 01:13:32,770
I was totally thinking about claiming that drop spot all the way up here.

2258
01:13:33,310 --> 01:13:36,810
Because I was like what if a zone goes up there and there's only a zone up there right now?

2259
01:13:38,270 --> 01:13:39,170
Let's go through here, Toki.

2260
01:13:39,230 --> 01:13:39,650
Let's go through here.

2261
01:13:39,770 --> 01:13:39,970
All right.

2262
01:13:40,030 --> 01:13:40,250
All right.

2263
01:13:40,250 --> 01:13:40,950
I'm right behind you.

2264
01:13:41,310 --> 01:13:41,630
Okay.

2265
01:13:42,290 --> 01:13:43,530
I have the dome ready.

2266
01:13:44,190 --> 01:13:44,610
All right.

2267
01:13:44,670 --> 01:13:45,650
I'm holding the dome too.

2268
01:13:47,310 --> 01:13:49,430
Wouldn't it be funny if we just took the car for like one second?

2269
01:13:49,570 --> 01:13:50,190
Like how would they know?

2270
01:13:50,190 --> 01:13:51,330
How would they know?

2271
01:13:53,150 --> 01:13:53,550
Okay.

2272
01:13:53,750 --> 01:13:54,330
Let's go down here.

2273
01:13:54,330 --> 01:13:54,850
How would they know?

2274
01:13:55,170 --> 01:13:57,070
It could be risky, but fuck it.

2275
01:13:58,050 --> 01:13:58,890
Oh, there's a big here.

2276
01:13:59,070 --> 01:13:59,910
You can hold on to that.

2277
01:14:00,330 --> 01:14:01,410
And then we can hit these.

2278
01:14:05,690 --> 01:14:06,970
And then let's hit this one here.

2279
01:14:07,990 --> 01:14:09,830
And then we're going to have to start moving through the tunnel.

2280
01:14:10,210 --> 01:14:10,690
All right.

2281
01:14:11,570 --> 01:14:11,970
Okay.

2282
01:14:12,010 --> 01:14:12,590
Shotgun here.

2283
01:14:13,170 --> 01:14:13,870
Oh, nice.

2284
01:14:14,570 --> 01:14:15,450
There's an AR here.

2285
01:14:15,450 --> 01:14:17,630
You can have this gun back then.

2286
01:14:17,970 --> 01:14:18,510
You sure?

2287
01:14:18,630 --> 01:14:18,850
Yeah.

2288
01:14:19,570 --> 01:14:19,970
Okay.

2289
01:14:19,970 --> 01:14:20,930
I'm 100% sure.

2290
01:14:21,330 --> 01:14:21,730
Okay.

2291
01:14:21,730 --> 01:14:22,050
Let's start shooting.

2292
01:14:22,050 --> 01:14:22,110
All right.

2293
01:14:22,450 --> 01:14:22,730
Let's go.

2294
01:14:22,730 --> 01:14:23,010
And then...

2295
01:14:23,390 --> 01:14:24,630
Oh, I'm actually carrying the med kits.

2296
01:14:24,830 --> 01:14:25,090
Yeah.

2297
01:14:25,290 --> 01:14:25,610
I'm going to carry those for us.

2298
01:14:27,150 --> 01:14:28,190
Oh, there's a magneto thing.

2299
01:14:29,590 --> 01:14:30,110
Oh, shit.

2300
01:14:30,450 --> 01:14:30,950
I'll grab it.

2301
01:14:31,550 --> 01:14:31,830
Okay.

2302
01:14:32,290 --> 01:14:33,830
Oh, there's a deagle here.

2303
01:14:33,870 --> 01:14:34,410
Oh, we have nitrous.

2304
01:14:34,450 --> 01:14:34,830
We have nitrous.

2305
01:14:34,870 --> 01:14:35,330
Here, come next to me.

2306
01:14:35,430 --> 01:14:35,710
Yeah.

2307
01:14:35,770 --> 01:14:36,130
Here, here.

2308
01:14:36,370 --> 01:14:37,010
I'm going to pop this.

2309
01:14:37,130 --> 01:14:37,750
You want to hold the med kit?

2310
01:14:38,310 --> 01:14:38,590
Yeah.

2311
01:14:38,590 --> 01:14:38,990
Hold the med kit.

2312
01:14:39,090 --> 01:14:39,990
I dropped the magneto.

2313
01:14:40,010 --> 01:14:40,410
You want it?

2314
01:14:40,770 --> 01:14:41,130
That's fine.

2315
01:14:41,550 --> 01:14:42,090
Team up here.

2316
01:14:43,110 --> 01:14:44,070
Oh, there's a ghost ship.

2317
01:14:44,190 --> 01:14:45,190
I'm going to grab that actually.

2318
01:14:45,410 --> 01:14:45,470
Wait.

2319
01:14:45,470 --> 01:14:46,030
Let's get this guy.

2320
01:14:48,250 --> 01:14:48,770
They're right here.

2321
01:14:50,350 --> 01:14:50,630
Cracked.

2322
01:14:51,470 --> 01:14:52,310
I'm going to chase.

2323
01:14:53,350 --> 01:14:54,470
Oh, you're so far.

2324
01:14:55,250 --> 01:14:55,570
Knocked him.

2325
01:14:55,830 --> 01:14:56,150
Nice.

2326
01:14:56,370 --> 01:14:57,530
I'm right behind you.

2327
01:14:58,070 --> 01:14:58,970
I have a ghost ship.

2328
01:14:59,030 --> 01:14:59,530
Oh, they have gloves.

2329
01:15:01,190 --> 01:15:01,510
Yo.

2330
01:15:02,210 --> 01:15:02,770
Oh, my God.

2331
01:15:02,810 --> 01:15:03,070
Get it.

2332
01:15:03,090 --> 01:15:03,410
Grab it.

2333
01:15:03,430 --> 01:15:03,710
Grab it.

2334
01:15:03,950 --> 01:15:04,710
You don't want it?

2335
01:15:04,850 --> 01:15:05,330
No, no, no.

2336
01:15:05,350 --> 01:15:05,890
You should have it.

2337
01:15:05,910 --> 01:15:06,730
I have magneto.

2338
01:15:06,730 --> 01:15:07,870
Oh, I can't grab it.

2339
01:15:07,890 --> 01:15:08,710
It's like stuck there.

2340
01:15:09,470 --> 01:15:09,790
Wait.

2341
01:15:09,870 --> 01:15:10,210
It fell down.

2342
01:15:10,290 --> 01:15:10,550
It fell down.

2343
01:15:10,550 --> 01:15:10,790
It fell down.

2344
01:15:10,810 --> 01:15:11,330
It's right here.

2345
01:15:11,410 --> 01:15:11,670
Yeah.

2346
01:15:11,930 --> 01:15:12,250
Okay.

2347
01:15:12,430 --> 01:15:14,070
I'm going to drop nitro.

2348
01:15:14,070 --> 01:15:14,670
I'm dropping a nitro.

2349
01:15:15,650 --> 01:15:17,950
And then I'm going to try to...

2350
01:15:17,950 --> 01:15:18,710
I need heals.

2351
01:15:18,750 --> 01:15:19,570
I don't have heals.

2352
01:15:20,630 --> 01:15:21,350
No, no, no, no, no.

2353
01:15:21,530 --> 01:15:23,470
I thought you took it.

2354
01:15:23,770 --> 01:15:24,230
No, no.

2355
01:15:24,230 --> 01:15:24,790
I dropped it for you.

2356
01:15:24,870 --> 01:15:25,110
Okay.

2357
01:15:25,390 --> 01:15:25,670
Whoop.

2358
01:15:25,710 --> 01:15:26,090
All right.

2359
01:15:26,590 --> 01:15:27,050
That's awkward.

2360
01:15:27,190 --> 01:15:27,790
Oh, we got to go.

2361
01:15:27,890 --> 01:15:28,310
We got to go.

2362
01:15:28,390 --> 01:15:28,770
We got to go.

2363
01:15:29,010 --> 01:15:31,150
Oh, no.

2364
01:15:31,270 --> 01:15:31,750
I fucked up.

2365
01:15:31,770 --> 01:15:31,990
Okay.

2366
01:15:32,530 --> 01:15:32,990
I'm dead.

2367
01:15:33,050 --> 01:15:33,350
I'm dead.

2368
01:15:33,530 --> 01:15:34,030
I'm dead.

2369
01:15:34,070 --> 01:15:34,390
I'm dead.

2370
01:15:34,410 --> 01:15:35,250
I'm dead to the zone.

2371
01:15:35,390 --> 01:15:35,970
I'm dead to the zone.

2372
01:15:35,970 --> 01:15:37,610
I can pop a med kit and I can grab you.

2373
01:15:38,130 --> 01:15:38,410
Okay.

2374
01:15:38,470 --> 01:15:39,030
Just keep running up.

2375
01:15:39,110 --> 01:15:39,590
Keep running up.

2376
01:15:40,090 --> 01:15:40,610
I'm crawling.

2377
01:15:40,750 --> 01:15:41,470
I'm going to come back for you.

2378
01:15:41,530 --> 01:15:42,050
I'm going to come back for you.

2379
01:15:42,610 --> 01:15:44,350
There's too many stuff to carry.

2380
01:15:45,470 --> 01:15:47,390
I was like, what do I get?

2381
01:15:48,190 --> 01:15:48,830
I'm confused.

2382
01:15:49,590 --> 01:15:50,590
I got overwhelmed.

2383
01:15:51,510 --> 01:15:52,210
I got you.

2384
01:15:52,350 --> 01:15:52,810
You're good.

2385
01:15:54,810 --> 01:15:55,890
You raised me up.

2386
01:15:55,890 --> 01:15:56,390
No one's going to see us.

2387
01:15:56,510 --> 01:15:56,910
No one's going to see us.

2388
01:15:57,030 --> 01:15:57,510
No one's going to see us.

2389
01:15:58,990 --> 01:15:59,650
Oh, my God.

2390
01:15:59,690 --> 01:16:00,190
There's a team there.

2391
01:16:00,230 --> 01:16:00,650
There's a team there.

2392
01:16:01,410 --> 01:16:02,570
You raised me up.

2393
01:16:03,010 --> 01:16:04,190
I got this.

2394
01:16:07,950 --> 01:16:08,670
Oh, no.

2395
01:16:10,450 --> 01:16:10,830
I'm dead.

2396
01:16:11,530 --> 01:16:11,850
Liv.

2397
01:16:15,720 --> 01:16:17,080
Target is in my cushion.

2398
01:16:18,260 --> 01:16:18,900
Oh, no.

2399
01:16:19,860 --> 01:16:20,180
Liv.

2400
01:16:21,580 --> 01:16:22,180
No.

2401
01:16:22,980 --> 01:16:26,800
My green won because I wanted the ghost ship.

2402
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:34,400
I threw it because I wanted the ghost ship.

2403
01:16:34,420 --> 01:16:35,540
I saw it.

2404
01:16:35,820 --> 01:16:36,600
It's okay.

2405
01:16:37,680 --> 01:16:38,280
No.

2406
01:16:38,300 --> 01:16:40,100
At least we got two kills though.

2407
01:16:40,160 --> 01:16:40,900
We got two kills.

2408
01:16:41,060 --> 01:16:41,840
Oh, thank God.

2409
01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:42,320
That is all good.

2410
01:16:42,580 --> 01:16:43,160
Thank God.

2411
01:16:43,180 --> 01:16:43,940
That is all good.

2412
01:16:44,200 --> 01:16:46,040
I can't believe it.

2413
01:16:46,100 --> 01:16:47,340
I got so greedy.

2414
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,160
Because I was like, oh shit.

2415
01:16:51,880 --> 01:16:52,360
Wait.

2416
01:16:52,480 --> 01:16:54,860
Why is replays all the way out here?

2417
01:16:55,440 --> 01:16:55,920
Wait.

2418
01:16:55,920 --> 01:16:57,720
He got knocked by zone.

2419
01:16:57,800 --> 01:16:58,240
Yeah.

2420
01:16:58,240 --> 01:16:59,860
Why were they all the way out here?

2421
01:16:59,900 --> 01:17:01,180
Why did they choose to push us?

2422
01:17:01,420 --> 01:17:01,480
Why were they?

2423
01:17:01,480 --> 01:17:01,820
Yeah.

2424
01:17:02,060 --> 01:17:03,260
Why did they choose to push us?

2425
01:17:03,320 --> 01:17:04,960
They could have literally just started rotating.

2426
01:17:05,140 --> 01:17:06,140
That was a smart thing to do.

2427
01:17:06,540 --> 01:17:08,800
I wanted to be a pirate.

2428
01:17:09,660 --> 01:17:10,920
That's all I want.

2429
01:17:11,160 --> 01:17:11,360
Wait.

2430
01:17:11,380 --> 01:17:12,140
They died to zone.

2431
01:17:12,320 --> 01:17:13,660
Because we had zero heals.

2432
01:17:14,040 --> 01:17:14,520
Yeah.

2433
01:17:14,640 --> 01:17:16,240
They died to zone.

2434
01:17:16,720 --> 01:17:19,580
They hoped we had heals and they died to fucking...

2435
01:17:19,580 --> 01:17:20,140
Oh, my God.

2436
01:17:20,160 --> 01:17:20,440
We're fucking losers.

2437
01:17:23,820 --> 01:17:29,140
They actually thought we had heals for the farm off of...

2438
01:17:30,520 --> 01:17:31,080
That's right.

2439
01:17:31,140 --> 01:17:32,020
We had no heals.

2440
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:33,120
We also...

2441
01:17:33,120 --> 01:17:33,740
Oh, my God.

2442
01:17:33,740 --> 01:17:34,400
The worst gamble.

2443
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:35,840
Oh, I had the ghost ship.

2444
01:17:35,880 --> 01:17:36,280
That's it.

2445
01:17:38,460 --> 01:17:40,760
They're like, oh, this guy definitely has heals.

2446
01:17:41,860 --> 01:17:43,200
Jokes on you, sucker.

2447
01:17:43,300 --> 01:17:44,500
I got a ghost ship.

2448
01:17:47,680 --> 01:17:49,560
The guy you killed was Bucky?

2449
01:17:49,560 --> 01:17:52,840
The same guy Doki was calling out for dying five times at one game?

2450
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:53,820
That's funny.

2451
01:17:53,820 --> 01:17:54,160
Oh, really?

2452
01:17:54,500 --> 01:17:55,160
Oh, that's...

2453
01:17:55,160 --> 01:17:55,720
Yeah.

2454
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:57,340
The ones who challenged us.

2455
01:17:57,440 --> 01:17:57,700
Yeah.

2456
01:17:57,840 --> 01:17:58,100
Yeah.

2457
01:17:59,320 --> 01:18:00,400
Oh, my God.

2458
01:18:00,400 --> 01:18:00,780
It's amazing.

2459
01:18:01,620 --> 01:18:02,500
Double punish.

2460
01:18:03,220 --> 01:18:03,660
Yeah.

2461
01:18:03,740 --> 01:18:06,960
I was thinking 50 steps ahead by not picking up that med kit.

2462
01:18:07,440 --> 01:18:11,740
By not picking up that med kit, they didn't get any heals.

2463
01:18:13,520 --> 01:18:13,960
Wait.

2464
01:18:14,080 --> 01:18:15,940
Did we kill both of them because of it?

2465
01:18:16,060 --> 01:18:16,500
Yeah.

2466
01:18:16,520 --> 01:18:17,320
They both died to storm.

2467
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:18,180
They both died to...

2468
01:18:19,560 --> 01:18:19,620
All right.

2469
01:18:19,780 --> 01:18:20,780
So deserved.

2470
01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:22,800
No, Bucky.

2471
01:18:23,060 --> 01:18:24,640
I can't believe it.

2472
01:18:24,780 --> 01:18:26,920
They both died to storm.

2473
01:18:27,460 --> 01:18:30,760
That was actually so gigabrain about everything you literally did there.

2474
01:18:30,940 --> 01:18:31,180
Yeah.

2475
01:18:31,220 --> 01:18:31,500
Yeah.

2476
01:18:31,520 --> 01:18:35,160
I purposely did not pick up a med kit because I wanted those two to die to zone.

2477
01:18:36,840 --> 01:18:38,260
My indirect kills.

2478
01:18:38,400 --> 01:18:43,000
I might have not got a kill by shooting my gun, but I got my kills by mental damage.

2479
01:18:46,600 --> 01:18:47,800
That's my teammate.

2480
01:18:49,040 --> 01:18:49,980
Emotional damage.

2481
01:18:50,040 --> 01:18:52,400
At least I died by gunshot.

2482
01:18:52,480 --> 01:18:55,860
Dying by zone because of lack of heals is so fucking embarrassing.

2483
01:18:56,600 --> 01:18:59,800
Chat will never let them live that down because of it.

2484
01:19:03,300 --> 01:19:04,380
Chat's like, no, no, no.

2485
01:19:04,440 --> 01:19:05,400
It was actually all part of the plan.

2486
01:19:05,400 --> 01:19:09,700
If you die to someone shooting at you, that you're as respectable.

2487
01:19:10,040 --> 01:19:13,060
But you dying to zone was a choice that you made willingly.

2488
01:19:13,320 --> 01:19:13,540
Right.

2489
01:19:13,840 --> 01:19:16,540
And Chat will heavily bully you for that shit.

2490
01:19:17,080 --> 01:19:17,780
That's why I said that.

2491
01:19:17,780 --> 01:19:19,860
Technically, I didn't die to zone.

2492
01:19:20,020 --> 01:19:21,280
I died to a guy that shot me.

2493
01:19:22,510 --> 01:19:27,920
I died to me failing you as a werewolf bodyguard.

2494
01:19:30,060 --> 01:19:32,060
I technically didn't die to zone.

2495
01:19:32,200 --> 01:19:33,880
I got finished out inside.

2496
01:19:34,200 --> 01:19:36,340
I got finished inside the spot.

2497
01:19:38,200 --> 01:19:39,500
Oh, that's true.

2498
01:19:39,800 --> 01:19:40,080
Yeah.

2499
01:19:40,620 --> 01:19:42,120
Yeah, we're good.

2500
01:19:42,300 --> 01:19:43,400
Everything was fine.

2501
01:19:43,520 --> 01:19:43,900
Yeah.

2502
01:19:44,040 --> 01:19:45,260
It was all according to plan.

2503
01:19:45,260 --> 01:19:47,840
I can't believe nobody's dying in this game though.

2504
01:19:48,480 --> 01:19:52,280
I wonder if the team that was challenging us at the very beginning.

2505
01:19:52,420 --> 01:19:54,100
I wonder if they all died way earlier.

2506
01:19:55,020 --> 01:19:58,760
Because we still got like 17th place.

2507
01:19:59,180 --> 01:20:00,300
So I'm just like wondering.

2508
01:20:00,340 --> 01:20:01,140
Wait, what the fuck?

2509
01:20:01,160 --> 01:20:01,700
You're right.

2510
01:20:01,760 --> 01:20:02,120
Yeah.

2511
01:20:02,120 --> 01:20:03,280
So like nobody died.

2512
01:20:03,420 --> 01:20:04,500
That's what I'm like thinking.

2513
01:20:04,520 --> 01:20:05,200
I was like, holy shit.

2514
01:20:05,220 --> 01:20:05,980
Nobody died.

2515
01:20:06,560 --> 01:20:07,060
Yeah.

2516
01:20:07,760 --> 01:20:08,980
That's actually crazy.

2517
01:20:09,640 --> 01:20:10,660
You know what though?

2518
01:20:10,680 --> 01:20:12,260
How is people alive still?

2519
01:20:12,900 --> 01:20:15,160
We got two kills this game.

2520
01:20:15,200 --> 01:20:15,240
Yeah.

2521
01:20:15,240 --> 01:20:16,940
We got two kills.

2522
01:20:17,200 --> 01:20:19,200
And then last game we got one kill, right?

2523
01:20:19,560 --> 01:20:20,040
Yeah.

2524
01:20:20,040 --> 01:20:20,600
We got one kill, yeah.

2525
01:20:20,600 --> 01:20:21,440
So we got three points from that.

2526
01:20:21,960 --> 01:20:22,560
Let's go.

2527
01:20:22,860 --> 01:20:23,900
We're not dead last.

2528
01:20:24,380 --> 01:20:24,780
Okay.

2529
01:20:24,840 --> 01:20:25,640
I don't know about that.

2530
01:20:25,780 --> 01:20:28,720
Because I feel like there's a lot of them.

2531
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:31,520
A lot of the other weaker teams, like the non-Fortnite players.

2532
01:20:31,960 --> 01:20:33,020
They're like...

2533
01:20:33,020 --> 01:20:33,840
They have...

2534
01:20:33,840 --> 01:20:36,160
They just like stay in zone.

2535
01:20:36,980 --> 01:20:37,340
Yeah.

2536
01:20:37,420 --> 01:20:37,780
Yeah.

2537
01:20:37,820 --> 01:20:41,260
I saw like their points were mostly just from...

2538
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:43,080
Oh my God.

2539
01:20:43,440 --> 01:20:44,640
The positioning.

2540
01:20:44,720 --> 01:20:45,160
Yeah.

2541
01:20:45,960 --> 01:20:46,400
Displacement.

2542
01:20:47,300 --> 01:20:48,000
It's like...

2543
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:52,460
It's kind of similar to Apex where it's like priority on surviving.

2544
01:20:52,860 --> 01:20:53,140
Yeah.

2545
01:20:53,180 --> 01:20:56,140
And then kill points are just like a little like add up or whatever.

2546
01:20:56,420 --> 01:20:56,800
Extra.

2547
01:20:56,800 --> 01:20:57,020
Yeah.

2548
01:21:00,040 --> 01:21:00,480
Woo.

2549
01:21:02,220 --> 01:21:03,700
Thank you for the radar.

2550
01:21:03,800 --> 01:21:04,540
Welcome in.

2551
01:21:04,620 --> 01:21:06,040
Thank you shape-shifting trap for the two months.

2552
01:21:06,080 --> 01:21:06,280
Oh my God.

2553
01:21:06,580 --> 01:21:07,980
That's the Magneto gloves.

2554
01:21:08,600 --> 01:21:08,940
Whoa.

2555
01:21:08,980 --> 01:21:10,000
Someone's using Magneto gloves?

2556
01:21:10,080 --> 01:21:10,360
Yeah.

2557
01:21:10,380 --> 01:21:10,560
Yeah.

2558
01:21:10,560 --> 01:21:10,620
Yeah.

2559
01:21:10,620 --> 01:21:11,480
Up the hill.

2560
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:12,840
The Javes team.

2561
01:21:13,560 --> 01:21:15,220
They were using Magneto gloves?

2562
01:21:15,220 --> 01:21:15,460
Yeah.

2563
01:21:15,460 --> 01:21:17,140
Magneto gloves to like throw it at people downstairs.

2564
01:21:17,340 --> 01:21:17,640
Oh.

2565
01:21:17,660 --> 01:21:17,840
What?

2566
01:21:17,860 --> 01:21:18,360
Yeah.

2567
01:21:18,400 --> 01:21:20,220
That thing's like insane for like builds.

2568
01:21:20,260 --> 01:21:20,420
Yeah.

2569
01:21:20,460 --> 01:21:21,780
I literally saw them like...

2570
01:21:22,340 --> 01:21:24,740
He has fists and Magneto gloves?

2571
01:21:25,240 --> 01:21:25,940
Hell yeah.

2572
01:21:26,160 --> 01:21:28,240
This is the loadout I usually have to run.

2573
01:21:28,680 --> 01:21:28,760
What the fuck?

2574
01:21:28,820 --> 01:21:29,940
Oh my God.

2575
01:21:30,600 --> 01:21:34,540
It literally owns like people on like any surface.

2576
01:21:40,100 --> 01:21:43,100
How is like weapon bans not banning fists or...

2577
01:21:43,100 --> 01:21:44,900
Like I don't think any of the gloves are banned.

2578
01:21:45,940 --> 01:21:46,460
Yeah.

2579
01:21:46,480 --> 01:21:46,660
No.

2580
01:21:46,760 --> 01:21:47,900
They're all in.

2581
01:21:48,040 --> 01:21:48,780
Which I think...

2582
01:21:48,780 --> 01:21:49,560
I think it's like...

2583
01:21:49,560 --> 01:21:50,660
Is this sponsored by Disney?

2584
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:51,820
Is this like...

2585
01:21:54,360 --> 01:21:54,880
Like...

2586
01:21:54,880 --> 01:21:56,400
I don't understand.

2587
01:21:56,740 --> 01:21:59,380
They ban regular guns but still...

2588
01:21:59,380 --> 01:21:59,600
How...

2589
01:21:59,600 --> 01:22:01,980
How the Disney gloves are not banned.

2590
01:22:02,180 --> 01:22:03,340
Like I don't understand.

2591
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,400
Why are the Disney gloves still in here?

2592
01:22:06,620 --> 01:22:07,080
Like...

2593
01:22:07,080 --> 01:22:08,180
Oh my God.

2594
01:22:09,840 --> 01:22:12,600
Also the crazy thing about the gloves is they go through the shield bubble too.

2595
01:22:12,600 --> 01:22:14,760
Are we trying to advertise Disney right now?

2596
01:22:14,820 --> 01:22:16,040
They don't need more advertising.

2597
01:22:16,700 --> 01:22:17,740
Oh my God.

2598
01:22:17,740 --> 01:22:18,260
Oh my God.

2599
01:22:18,480 --> 01:22:18,760
Oh my God.

2600
01:22:21,920 --> 01:22:23,940
Disney overlords wanted in.

2601
01:22:24,220 --> 01:22:25,220
Use the gloves!

2602
01:22:25,400 --> 01:22:25,920
There you go!

2603
01:22:25,980 --> 01:22:26,700
There you go!

2604
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:28,800
Is State Farm owned by Disney?

2605
01:22:28,960 --> 01:22:29,500
Is that it?

2606
01:22:31,100 --> 01:22:34,060
Did they get bought by Disney today?

2607
01:22:35,420 --> 01:22:35,980
Wait!

2608
01:22:36,380 --> 01:22:37,980
The universe is coming together!

2609
01:22:38,120 --> 01:22:39,160
Everything is owned by Disney!

2610
01:22:41,800 --> 01:22:42,360
Probably.

2611
01:22:42,360 --> 01:22:43,760
It goes deep.

2612
01:22:44,580 --> 01:22:46,540
My soul is owned by Disney.

2613
01:22:46,920 --> 01:22:48,260
I'm a Lion King nerd.

2614
01:22:48,260 --> 01:22:48,480
Oh!

2615
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,420
The magneto gloves people won.

2616
01:22:51,580 --> 01:22:52,060
Nice.

2617
01:22:52,340 --> 01:22:52,820
Yeah!

2618
01:22:53,260 --> 01:22:54,560
No condom skin!

2619
01:22:54,880 --> 01:22:55,460
Thank God!

2620
01:23:00,400 --> 01:23:00,880
Dang.

2621
01:23:01,180 --> 01:23:02,760
I'm just gonna run that loadout.

2622
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:04,260
Alright, what are we doing next?

2623
01:23:05,060 --> 01:23:07,900
Alright, I have... What would go well with this skin?

2624
01:23:08,500 --> 01:23:09,180
I don't know.

2625
01:23:09,260 --> 01:23:09,960
Oh, with that skin?

2626
01:23:10,220 --> 01:23:10,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2627
01:23:10,680 --> 01:23:12,040
It's like a Marvel skin.

2628
01:23:12,100 --> 01:23:13,160
Oh no, it's like totally opposite.

2629
01:23:13,580 --> 01:23:15,680
You said fake fan!

2630
01:23:15,860 --> 01:23:17,340
You said Marvel!

2631
01:23:18,260 --> 01:23:19,600
I'm gonna be Marvel?

2632
01:23:20,060 --> 01:23:20,940
I can't believe it!

2633
01:23:21,480 --> 01:23:24,220
Wait, what's a Marv... I mean, do you have a Marvel equivalent?

2634
01:23:24,560 --> 01:23:27,360
I have so many Marv... I have no DC skins.

2635
01:23:27,760 --> 01:23:30,280
But do you have like a Marvel equivalent to...

2636
01:23:31,460 --> 01:23:32,020
Um...

2637
01:23:32,020 --> 01:23:32,780
To... To...

2638
01:23:32,780 --> 01:23:34,800
The Batman who laughs.

2639
01:23:35,220 --> 01:23:35,820
I can be Thanos.

2640
01:23:35,820 --> 01:23:36,320
He's like a villain.

2641
01:23:36,640 --> 01:23:38,600
A Thanos... Okay.

2642
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:39,600
You know what?

2643
01:23:39,640 --> 01:23:40,640
Yeah, let's get Thanos.

2644
01:23:40,860 --> 01:23:43,060
Let's get the biggest hitbox in here.

2645
01:23:43,280 --> 01:23:44,060
You know what?

2646
01:23:45,060 --> 01:23:45,920
Let's do it.

2647
01:23:45,920 --> 01:23:47,120
I'm gonna be Thanos.

2648
01:23:47,780 --> 01:23:50,340
Oh, I do have Beast Boy.

2649
01:23:50,480 --> 01:23:51,040
I lied.

2650
01:23:51,120 --> 01:23:51,580
I have Beast Boy.

2651
01:23:51,980 --> 01:23:53,100
That Batman sucks.

2652
01:23:53,500 --> 01:23:54,560
Fuck you guys!

2653
01:23:54,680 --> 01:23:56,280
He is the best Batman!

2654
01:23:56,860 --> 01:23:58,500
He's my favorite Batman!

2655
01:23:59,380 --> 01:23:59,800
Fuck you guys!

2656
01:23:59,800 --> 01:24:00,100
Which one?

2657
01:24:00,120 --> 01:24:01,480
The Batman who laughs?

2658
01:24:01,660 --> 01:24:02,580
Yeah, the Batman who laughs.

2659
01:24:02,680 --> 01:24:05,160
People are like roasting my Batman.

2660
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:07,720
Isn't there like a really, really dark variant?

2661
01:24:08,080 --> 01:24:08,420
Oh, yeah.

2662
01:24:08,420 --> 01:24:09,300
It's like extra dark.

2663
01:24:09,520 --> 01:24:11,680
Yeah, he's like... He got bitten by the Joker.

2664
01:24:11,900 --> 01:24:14,800
It's like, you know how you get fisted by a wolf and you turn into a werewolf?

2665
01:24:15,200 --> 01:24:15,760
Yeah, yeah.

2666
01:24:15,860 --> 01:24:16,560
He got...

2667
01:24:16,560 --> 01:24:17,880
He gets fisted by a Joker?

2668
01:24:17,920 --> 01:24:18,280
He got...

2669
01:24:19,720 --> 01:24:21,700
That's what the fanfics wants you to...

2670
01:24:24,040 --> 01:24:26,320
Wait, do you have Loki?

2671
01:24:27,800 --> 01:24:28,600
I do have Loki.

2672
01:24:28,660 --> 01:24:29,180
Wait, no, no, no.

2673
01:24:29,180 --> 01:24:29,660
I don't have Loki.

2674
01:24:29,680 --> 01:24:31,020
Oh, Loki would have worked.

2675
01:24:31,120 --> 01:24:31,400
Yeah.

2676
01:24:31,640 --> 01:24:32,520
Wait, I need Thanos.

2677
01:24:32,760 --> 01:24:33,360
Do Thanos.

2678
01:24:33,820 --> 01:24:34,940
Okay, I'm gonna be Thanos.

2679
01:24:39,400 --> 01:24:40,480
Ironically, you're gonna run Thanos.

2680
01:24:46,160 --> 01:24:47,540
Wait, what big X are you using?

2681
01:24:47,640 --> 01:24:48,120
What are you gonna use?

2682
01:24:48,120 --> 01:24:51,080
Oh, I'm using the pom-poms because I want to cheer you on.

2683
01:24:51,300 --> 01:24:51,720
Let's go.

2684
01:24:51,860 --> 01:24:52,140
Okay.

2685
01:24:52,480 --> 01:24:56,520
I can use... I have an inflatable pool noodle.

2686
01:24:57,800 --> 01:24:58,540
A balloon.

2687
01:24:58,560 --> 01:24:59,660
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2688
01:24:59,700 --> 01:25:00,260
That'll work.

2689
01:25:00,720 --> 01:25:01,900
Okay, I'm gonna do that one.

2690
01:25:01,960 --> 01:25:04,980
Okay, I have a small hitbox and you have the biggest hitbox.

2691
01:25:05,120 --> 01:25:06,080
This will work.

2692
01:25:06,240 --> 01:25:08,340
This is gonna work.

2693
01:25:09,060 --> 01:25:10,040
Wait, what's your back bling?

2694
01:25:10,320 --> 01:25:12,540
My back bling is like golf shit.

2695
01:25:13,400 --> 01:25:14,380
Wait, golf shit?

2696
01:25:14,380 --> 01:25:16,380
My back bling, cat, uh, ride a cat.

2697
01:25:17,200 --> 01:25:18,460
Okay, I can run...

2698
01:25:19,560 --> 01:25:22,020
Wait, what is some, like, golf shit I can run?

2699
01:25:22,420 --> 01:25:23,780
I can use, like...

2700
01:25:23,780 --> 01:25:25,180
It's the perfect balance.

2701
01:25:29,560 --> 01:25:31,060
Dang, what do I... Chat, what do I use?

2702
01:25:31,180 --> 01:25:32,720
I need a spiky backpack or something.

2703
01:25:32,840 --> 01:25:32,960
Pew, pew.

2704
01:25:34,100 --> 01:25:34,460
Pew.

2705
01:25:35,840 --> 01:25:36,200
Pew.

2706
01:25:36,640 --> 01:25:38,340
I mean, I could use that one.

2707
01:25:38,460 --> 01:25:40,360
Oh, no, here I have the anarchy backpack.

2708
01:25:40,860 --> 01:25:42,040
The anarchy backpack?

2709
01:25:42,380 --> 01:25:42,880
What's that?

2710
01:25:43,260 --> 01:25:44,360
Yeah, it, uh... Hold on.

2711
01:25:44,380 --> 01:25:45,180
Let me turn around real quick.

2712
01:25:46,200 --> 01:25:46,700
Yay!

2713
01:25:47,560 --> 01:25:50,280
What the f- Oh, it has, like, spikes on the backpack!

2714
01:25:50,720 --> 01:25:52,120
It has, like, spikes all over itself.

2715
01:25:52,620 --> 01:25:53,120
Yeah!

2716
01:25:53,360 --> 01:25:53,860
Uh...

2717
01:25:53,860 --> 01:25:54,300
Come on, guys.

2718
01:25:54,600 --> 01:25:55,900
We're the perfect team.

2719
01:25:56,360 --> 01:26:00,100
Oh, I could... I can't believe I didn't do the golf dance with the golf batman.

2720
01:26:02,820 --> 01:26:05,040
The dance that matters the most.

2721
01:26:05,100 --> 01:26:05,680
Oh, shit.

2722
01:26:05,700 --> 01:26:06,400
You're actually them.

2723
01:26:06,660 --> 01:26:07,740
I'm actually them.

2724
01:26:08,980 --> 01:26:10,320
The best batman.

2725
01:26:11,100 --> 01:26:12,100
Oh, my God.

2726
01:26:12,180 --> 01:26:13,900
That's so fucking cursed with Thanos.

2727
01:26:14,120 --> 01:26:14,360
Oh, shit.

2728
01:26:14,360 --> 01:26:14,360
You're actually them.

2729
01:26:14,360 --> 01:26:15,380
That's so...

2730
01:26:16,720 --> 01:26:17,240
That's so...

2731
01:26:17,240 --> 01:26:19,760
That's so bad with Thanos.

2732
01:26:22,120 --> 01:26:23,160
Holy shit.

2733
01:26:23,560 --> 01:26:26,480
Alright, what's the... what's the rule three?

2734
01:26:26,740 --> 01:26:28,340
The game for game number three.

2735
01:26:28,400 --> 01:26:29,060
What's the rules?

2736
01:26:29,360 --> 01:26:31,100
Oh, the rules are...

2737
01:26:32,200 --> 01:26:33,380
Um... let's see.

2738
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:34,860
Because I know there's hotspot, right?

2739
01:26:35,660 --> 01:26:37,600
It's literally the same for game three.

2740
01:26:37,900 --> 01:26:38,620
Wait, what?

2741
01:26:38,720 --> 01:26:39,700
Yeah, literally the same, yeah.

2742
01:26:40,420 --> 01:26:42,420
Then game four is when it changes.

2743
01:26:43,200 --> 01:26:44,300
Wait, so they actually...

2744
01:26:44,300 --> 01:26:45,340
They actually removed save zones.

2745
01:26:45,860 --> 01:26:48,060
Yeah, they basically got rid of the save zones.

2746
01:26:48,360 --> 01:26:48,460
Why?

2747
01:26:49,900 --> 01:26:53,020
I think because, like, people were saying, like, oh, we want the games to go longer or faster.

2748
01:26:53,500 --> 01:26:55,660
Oh, because of the Fortnite thing, yeah.

2749
01:26:55,860 --> 01:26:56,160
But it's, like, counterintuitive.

2750
01:26:56,160 --> 01:26:58,920
It's counterintuitive, though, because everyone still lives until end zone.

2751
01:26:59,240 --> 01:26:59,580
Yeah.

2752
01:27:00,340 --> 01:27:00,740
So...

2753
01:27:00,740 --> 01:27:01,220
It's for us.

2754
01:27:01,360 --> 01:27:02,540
The save zone's for us.

2755
01:27:02,800 --> 01:27:04,000
We're just little people.

2756
01:27:04,500 --> 01:27:04,860
Yeah.

2757
01:27:05,080 --> 01:27:06,120
We're just little people.

2758
01:27:06,120 --> 01:27:06,920
We're just little people.

2759
01:27:07,980 --> 01:27:08,400
We're just little people.

2760
01:27:08,400 --> 01:27:09,200
We're the little people.

2761
01:27:09,400 --> 01:27:09,600
Yeah.

2762
01:27:10,520 --> 01:27:10,600
Oh.

2763
01:27:12,460 --> 01:27:12,860
Fortnite...

2764
01:27:12,860 --> 01:27:14,300
You guys have, like, 100 million tournaments.

2765
01:27:14,740 --> 01:27:15,140
Come on.

2766
01:27:17,340 --> 01:27:18,940
This is our one tournament.

2767
01:27:19,240 --> 01:27:22,340
The one tournament we're supposed to be in for fun.

2768
01:27:22,700 --> 01:27:24,820
It's so regular Fortnite rules.

2769
01:27:25,020 --> 01:27:25,420
Come on.

2770
01:27:26,900 --> 01:27:30,960
You guys literally have a tournament right after this tournament.

2771
01:27:31,600 --> 01:27:32,400
Like, you...

2772
01:27:33,120 --> 01:27:37,360
Like, they're like, no, no, we have to warm up for our next tournament with more money on it.

2773
01:27:38,980 --> 01:27:40,260
Like, what the fuck?

2774
01:27:40,880 --> 01:27:41,360
Like...

2775
01:27:42,860 --> 01:27:44,960
We actually have another tournament right after this tournament.

2776
01:27:47,020 --> 01:27:47,420
Wait.

2777
01:27:47,560 --> 01:27:47,760
What?

2778
01:27:47,800 --> 01:27:48,360
What are they...

2779
01:27:48,360 --> 01:27:50,000
Is there something they tagged us all in?

2780
01:27:50,400 --> 01:27:51,580
On chat?

2781
01:27:51,860 --> 01:27:52,220
Huh?

2782
01:27:53,940 --> 01:27:54,480
Oh, no.

2783
01:27:54,540 --> 01:27:54,760
We're okay.

2784
01:27:54,900 --> 01:27:55,280
No.

2785
01:27:55,280 --> 01:27:55,480
No.

2786
01:27:55,480 --> 01:27:56,440
The code's out.

2787
01:27:56,560 --> 01:27:56,860
We have, like, a thing on there.

2788
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:57,200
Yeah.

2789
01:27:57,240 --> 01:27:57,680
We got the code.

2790
01:27:58,600 --> 01:27:59,160
All right.

2791
01:27:59,200 --> 01:28:00,140
I'm ready to go.

2792
01:28:00,160 --> 01:28:00,180
Okay.

2793
01:28:00,180 --> 01:28:01,300
So, literally, same rules.

2794
01:28:01,620 --> 01:28:03,140
Same rules, by the way.

2795
01:28:03,600 --> 01:28:04,860
We're just little guys.

2796
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:08,380
We're just little guys trying to make it in this cruel Fortnite world.

2797
01:28:09,020 --> 01:28:09,900
You know what's funny?

2798
01:28:09,940 --> 01:28:12,840
Is I think I killed the other player that was...

2799
01:28:12,840 --> 01:28:13,460
That was on the team.

2800
01:28:13,540 --> 01:28:13,900
Yeah.

2801
01:28:13,900 --> 01:28:15,120
That had two more points than us yesterday.

2802
01:28:15,420 --> 01:28:16,360
Oh, nice.

2803
01:28:16,980 --> 01:28:17,380
Yeah.

2804
01:28:17,540 --> 01:28:20,660
That's when we were rotating near the big...

2805
01:28:20,660 --> 01:28:21,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2806
01:28:21,120 --> 01:28:21,560
The big firing.

2807
01:28:22,420 --> 01:28:22,820
Wait.

2808
01:28:22,900 --> 01:28:25,480
Are they still gonna contest us?

2809
01:28:26,220 --> 01:28:26,880
They might.

2810
01:28:27,120 --> 01:28:28,280
Let me actually see the...

2811
01:28:28,280 --> 01:28:29,480
I wanna see the draw spots real quick.

2812
01:28:29,480 --> 01:28:29,740
Yeah.

2813
01:28:29,740 --> 01:28:31,120
Like, why are they contesting us?

2814
01:28:31,160 --> 01:28:31,800
We claimed that.

2815
01:28:32,920 --> 01:28:33,660
They probably...

2816
01:28:33,660 --> 01:28:34,840
It's probably because they saw who we were.

2817
01:28:34,920 --> 01:28:36,320
And they're like, oh, they're easily killable.

2818
01:28:36,520 --> 01:28:36,840
Yeah.

2819
01:28:36,840 --> 01:28:37,400
But little did they know...

2820
01:28:37,400 --> 01:28:37,500
Yeah.

2821
01:28:37,500 --> 01:28:37,960
Right, bitch.

2822
01:28:37,960 --> 01:28:39,160
I have a bodyguard.

2823
01:28:39,960 --> 01:28:42,580
I might be easily killable, but I have a bodyguard.

2824
01:28:42,580 --> 01:28:42,820
I have a bodyguard.

2825
01:28:48,040 --> 01:28:48,900
They don't know.

2826
01:28:49,800 --> 01:28:50,200
Yeah.

2827
01:28:50,220 --> 01:28:50,360
Wait.

2828
01:28:50,400 --> 01:28:50,960
They're literally...

2829
01:28:50,960 --> 01:28:52,600
They decided to chow us.

2830
01:28:52,980 --> 01:28:53,380
Wait.

2831
01:28:53,440 --> 01:28:55,080
They actually decided to, like, just...

2832
01:28:55,080 --> 01:28:55,180
Yeah.

2833
01:28:55,180 --> 01:28:56,900
They added their names on top of us.

2834
01:28:57,300 --> 01:28:57,700
Oh.

2835
01:28:58,520 --> 01:28:58,920
Yeah.

2836
01:28:59,240 --> 01:29:00,260
We already had it.

2837
01:29:00,620 --> 01:29:01,660
But they're like...

2838
01:29:01,660 --> 01:29:03,700
We're the only team getting contested, by the way.

2839
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:04,100
Wait.

2840
01:29:04,120 --> 01:29:04,480
What?

2841
01:29:04,640 --> 01:29:06,520
Out of everywhere on the map.

2842
01:29:06,640 --> 01:29:06,780
Yeah.

2843
01:29:06,800 --> 01:29:07,000
Wait.

2844
01:29:07,020 --> 01:29:07,220
Wait.

2845
01:29:07,220 --> 01:29:07,700
But, like...

2846
01:29:08,100 --> 01:29:08,940
Like, what do you mean?

2847
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:10,400
Did they, like, just add it there...

2848
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:12,000
They dropped it on top of you, guys?

2849
01:29:12,040 --> 01:29:12,180
Yeah.

2850
01:29:12,180 --> 01:29:12,360
They just...

2851
01:29:12,360 --> 01:29:12,800
They literally threw it at us.

2852
01:29:12,820 --> 01:29:15,280
They just threw their box on top of us, and then they added their name there.

2853
01:29:15,400 --> 01:29:16,580
I don't see...

2854
01:29:16,580 --> 01:29:16,840
Wait.

2855
01:29:16,880 --> 01:29:17,640
I don't see their name.

2856
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:18,700
Where is it?

2857
01:29:18,820 --> 01:29:18,940
Wait.

2858
01:29:18,960 --> 01:29:19,100
Really?

2859
01:29:19,220 --> 01:29:21,220
I clicked the latest one.

2860
01:29:21,720 --> 01:29:22,100
Oh.

2861
01:29:23,460 --> 01:29:24,360
I mean, that's fine.

2862
01:29:24,540 --> 01:29:25,820
I will happily keep killing them.

2863
01:29:26,060 --> 01:29:26,660
I don't know.

2864
01:29:26,760 --> 01:29:26,880
Oh, my God.

2865
01:29:27,200 --> 01:29:28,680
What the fuck is wrong with...

2866
01:29:28,680 --> 01:29:28,880
Wait.

2867
01:29:28,980 --> 01:29:29,460
You're right.

2868
01:29:30,040 --> 01:29:30,420
Yeah.

2869
01:29:30,440 --> 01:29:32,720
No, it's J3 in a plunge.

2870
01:29:32,820 --> 01:29:33,420
Are you...

2871
01:29:33,860 --> 01:29:34,240
Wait.

2872
01:29:34,260 --> 01:29:34,600
Who's that?

2873
01:29:34,760 --> 01:29:36,460
It's the Overwatch players.

2874
01:29:37,160 --> 01:29:38,320
Oh, it's the Overwatch players.

2875
01:29:38,320 --> 01:29:38,660
Get shit on.

2876
01:29:39,520 --> 01:29:40,380
They're Overwatch players.

2877
01:29:40,380 --> 01:29:40,800
Oh, my God.

2878
01:29:42,820 --> 01:29:43,520
You got fucking shit on you.

2879
01:29:43,600 --> 01:29:47,160
You got, like, killed by one guy that doesn't even play Overwatch.

2880
01:29:47,640 --> 01:29:48,280
Fucking...

2881
01:29:48,280 --> 01:29:49,120
He's not...

2882
01:29:49,120 --> 01:29:56,380
Dory has not fucking been in Overwatch World Cup or anything, but he fucking shit on you, too.

2883
01:30:00,420 --> 01:30:02,760
You guys are professional gamers?

2884
01:30:03,460 --> 01:30:04,100
Like...

2885
01:30:05,520 --> 01:30:09,400
My favorite thing about the fight was that they both peeked me.

2886
01:30:09,560 --> 01:30:10,100
Yeah.

2887
01:30:10,120 --> 01:30:11,920
And they missed their giggle shots.

2888
01:30:12,040 --> 01:30:12,400
Yeah.

2889
01:30:12,400 --> 01:30:12,800
And I was like...

2890
01:30:12,900 --> 01:30:13,800
I was like, what?

2891
01:30:13,880 --> 01:30:14,180
Okay.

2892
01:30:14,480 --> 01:30:15,580
Oh, my God.

2893
01:30:16,880 --> 01:30:17,620
That's funny.

2894
01:30:17,900 --> 01:30:19,080
I can't believe that was them.

2895
01:30:19,260 --> 01:30:21,840
I can't believe that was J3 in a plunge.

2896
01:30:21,900 --> 01:30:22,420
Oh, my God.

2897
01:30:22,480 --> 01:30:23,240
That is hilarious.

2898
01:30:24,940 --> 01:30:25,700
All right, chat.

2899
01:30:25,900 --> 01:30:27,620
Time to challenge some Overwatch players.

2900
01:30:27,620 --> 01:30:30,140
I might be shit, but I have a player that's better than both of you.

2901
01:30:30,520 --> 01:30:30,960
Like...

2902
01:30:33,460 --> 01:30:34,560
Let's fucking go.

2903
01:30:38,660 --> 01:30:42,180
Guys, it's okay to shit talk to them, because they purposely contested us.

2904
01:30:42,300 --> 01:30:42,700
Yeah.

2905
01:30:42,700 --> 01:30:42,780
Yeah.

2906
01:30:42,780 --> 01:30:42,900
They literally had...

2907
01:30:42,900 --> 01:30:44,900
We literally had to drop before them.

2908
01:30:45,040 --> 01:30:45,400
Yeah.

2909
01:30:45,420 --> 01:30:46,960
They literally could drop anywhere.

2910
01:30:47,400 --> 01:30:47,840
Like...

2911
01:30:47,840 --> 01:30:49,100
They could have...

2912
01:30:49,100 --> 01:30:53,920
There's, like, so many places they could drop at, but they decided to contest us.

2913
01:30:54,320 --> 01:30:54,760
Like...

2914
01:30:55,340 --> 01:30:56,920
I wonder what the dialogue was.

2915
01:30:56,960 --> 01:30:58,220
They're probably like, oh, yeah.

2916
01:30:58,260 --> 01:30:58,820
That's just...

2917
01:30:58,820 --> 01:30:59,180
That's just...

2918
01:30:59,180 --> 01:30:59,440
Yeah.

2919
01:30:59,440 --> 01:31:00,020
They're last place.

2920
01:31:00,080 --> 01:31:00,580
We can...

2921
01:31:00,580 --> 01:31:01,360
They're VTubers.

2922
01:31:01,440 --> 01:31:01,700
Yeah.

2923
01:31:01,760 --> 01:31:02,360
We can kill them.

2924
01:31:02,460 --> 01:31:02,760
Yeah.

2925
01:31:02,880 --> 01:31:03,820
They're last place.

2926
01:31:04,020 --> 01:31:05,060
They can...

2927
01:31:05,060 --> 01:31:05,560
We can handle it.

2928
01:31:05,560 --> 01:31:07,680
They totally never killed Apex pros or anything like that.

2929
01:31:09,740 --> 01:31:10,180
Wait.

2930
01:31:10,200 --> 01:31:10,740
We're 15?

2931
01:31:13,080 --> 01:31:14,280
Let's fucking go.

2932
01:31:14,740 --> 01:31:15,280
Wait.

2933
01:31:15,360 --> 01:31:16,600
Where's J3 and Reply?

2934
01:31:16,620 --> 01:31:17,640
I don't even know.

2935
01:31:17,820 --> 01:31:17,940
No.

2936
01:31:17,940 --> 01:31:18,680
Where are these guys?

2937
01:31:19,240 --> 01:31:20,560
Let's fucking go.

2938
01:31:20,880 --> 01:31:21,320
Oh, yeah.

2939
01:31:21,420 --> 01:31:23,900
Thanks for giving us a point to be 15th place.

2940
01:31:24,620 --> 01:31:25,660
Fuck, yeah.

2941
01:31:26,400 --> 01:31:27,680
I'm proud of us.

2942
01:31:27,680 --> 01:31:28,360
Me too.

2943
01:31:28,540 --> 01:31:29,600
We synergized.

2944
01:31:29,820 --> 01:31:31,460
I'm proud of us, too.

2945
01:31:31,620 --> 01:31:32,920
Oh, Jay's in, like, 18th?

2946
01:31:36,650 --> 01:31:37,190
Damn.

2947
01:31:38,930 --> 01:31:40,390
Oh, my God.

2948
01:31:40,690 --> 01:31:42,930
They're 19th.

2949
01:31:42,950 --> 01:31:44,190
Oh, my God.

2950
01:31:44,190 --> 01:31:44,610
Oh, my God.

2951
01:31:44,630 --> 01:31:44,730
And Holynia's in, like, middle of formation.

2952
01:31:44,990 --> 01:31:46,090
Land on us, again!

2953
01:31:46,290 --> 01:31:47,490
Give us another point!

2954
01:31:47,930 --> 01:31:49,130
Land on us again!

2955
01:31:50,430 --> 01:31:51,370
I'm walking down.

2956
01:31:51,710 --> 01:31:53,350
I'm down, please do.

2957
01:31:54,110 --> 01:31:55,130
We are hungry.

2958
01:31:55,350 --> 01:31:55,810
We're hungry.

2959
01:31:56,330 --> 01:31:59,430
They got 19th place in that game.

2960
01:31:59,830 --> 01:32:00,590
Oh, my...

2961
01:32:00,590 --> 01:32:00,910
Oh, dude!

2962
01:32:00,950 --> 01:32:01,870
They did die early!

2963
01:32:02,190 --> 01:32:02,510
Yeah.

2964
01:32:02,610 --> 01:32:04,410
They died so early that night.

2965
01:32:04,610 --> 01:32:06,350
I think they died when I was hiding?

2966
01:32:07,690 --> 01:32:08,130
Yeah.

2967
01:32:08,130 --> 01:32:08,850
Do you remember how, like...

2968
01:32:08,850 --> 01:32:09,030
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2969
01:32:09,030 --> 01:32:10,050
...I saw one of the condoms or whatever?

2970
01:32:10,230 --> 01:32:10,370
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2971
01:32:10,370 --> 01:32:11,390
I'm pretty sure that was them.

2972
01:32:11,470 --> 01:32:11,890
Wait, did you?

2973
01:32:11,910 --> 01:32:13,290
Oh my god, did you guys really drop?

2974
01:32:13,350 --> 01:32:13,730
Yeah, yeah, you don't know.

2975
01:32:13,910 --> 01:32:22,470
This is a pretty far drop, so we'll have to pop our shit pretty early.

2976
01:32:26,870 --> 01:32:27,590
That's on them.

2977
01:32:27,690 --> 01:32:31,110
They literally did not have to land on us, but they chose that.

2978
01:32:33,150 --> 01:32:35,190
They could've chose not to die to us.

2979
01:32:35,190 --> 01:32:40,370
They could've chose to literally land anywhere else because there's enough drop spots for them.

2980
01:32:40,510 --> 01:32:41,590
That's like the crazy part.

2981
01:32:41,910 --> 01:32:42,930
This map is so big.

2982
01:32:43,190 --> 01:32:44,450
They literally chose this.

2983
01:32:44,450 --> 01:32:47,250
And it's not like Apex where there's like, you know...

2984
01:32:47,250 --> 01:32:48,050
They're doing it again.

2985
01:32:48,070 --> 01:32:49,390
They're contesting us again.

2986
01:32:49,550 --> 01:32:50,270
I see them.

2987
01:32:50,530 --> 01:32:52,130
Wait, there's like three people here.

2988
01:32:52,150 --> 01:32:52,550
Wait, what?

2989
01:32:52,670 --> 01:32:53,350
Wait, there's three.

2990
01:32:53,610 --> 01:32:56,350
Why are there so many people contesting us?

2991
01:32:56,610 --> 01:32:57,630
What the fuck?

2992
01:32:57,690 --> 01:32:58,490
There's all the people.

2993
01:32:58,490 --> 01:32:58,950
Where do we go?

2994
01:32:59,410 --> 01:32:59,890
Doryu?

2995
01:33:00,070 --> 01:33:01,690
No, we're chilling here.

2996
01:33:01,770 --> 01:33:02,170
We're chilling here.

2997
01:33:02,230 --> 01:33:03,530
That's like two different teams.

2998
01:33:03,770 --> 01:33:04,590
Yeah, they're trying to shoot you.

2999
01:33:06,710 --> 01:33:08,150
Wait, there's two teams now.

3000
01:33:09,910 --> 01:33:11,050
Wait, one is cracked.

3001
01:33:14,330 --> 01:33:15,250
36 flesh on them?

3002
01:33:16,450 --> 01:33:18,310
I'm like not landing in a good spot.

3003
01:33:18,450 --> 01:33:19,430
Oh my god, I almost knocked one.

3004
01:33:21,490 --> 01:33:22,130
We get it, we get it.

3005
01:33:22,130 --> 01:33:22,810
There's some over there.

3006
01:33:22,870 --> 01:33:23,370
I see them.

3007
01:33:24,490 --> 01:33:27,790
I'm gonna back just in case because I was getting pushed.

3008
01:33:29,370 --> 01:33:30,450
Oh, I got good guns.

3009
01:33:30,550 --> 01:33:31,050
I got good guns.

3010
01:33:31,290 --> 01:33:31,550
Okay, me too.

3011
01:33:31,550 --> 01:33:32,110
Doryu, be careful there.

3012
01:33:32,110 --> 01:33:32,390
Be careful.

3013
01:33:32,650 --> 01:33:33,590
Me, I'm coming over to you.

3014
01:33:33,970 --> 01:33:34,330
Okay.

3015
01:33:36,370 --> 01:33:37,650
What the fuck?

3016
01:33:37,770 --> 01:33:40,090
Now we have two teams pushing us?

3017
01:33:40,290 --> 01:33:41,810
I have a sniper rifle.

3018
01:33:41,810 --> 01:33:42,670
What the fuck is wrong with these freaks?

3019
01:33:43,170 --> 01:33:46,730
Like, bro, you already got farmed.

3020
01:33:46,730 --> 01:33:47,650
Like, get out.

3021
01:33:48,410 --> 01:33:49,490
Fucking thank you.

3022
01:33:49,770 --> 01:33:54,510
Oh, I was about to shoot this guy.

3023
01:33:54,750 --> 01:33:55,250
Wait.

3024
01:33:55,850 --> 01:33:56,750
Am I able to?

3025
01:33:57,670 --> 01:33:58,610
Oh, damn.

3026
01:33:58,730 --> 01:33:58,990
Okay.

3027
01:34:00,170 --> 01:34:02,330
Why are so many people here?

3028
01:34:02,570 --> 01:34:03,390
Should we go back here?

3029
01:34:03,550 --> 01:34:04,290
Is this looted?

3030
01:34:05,790 --> 01:34:06,170
Oh.

3031
01:34:06,570 --> 01:34:06,950
Cracked?

3032
01:34:07,490 --> 01:34:08,090
Wait, wait, wait.

3033
01:34:08,330 --> 01:34:09,110
One behind... What?

3034
01:34:09,230 --> 01:34:09,810
Oh, my god.

3035
01:34:09,870 --> 01:34:10,710
He's behind the tree here.

3036
01:34:10,850 --> 01:34:11,170
He's low.

3037
01:34:11,290 --> 01:34:11,530
He's low.

3038
01:34:12,450 --> 01:34:13,870
Wait, this is a different team.

3039
01:34:13,950 --> 01:34:14,430
This is not theirs.

3040
01:34:14,430 --> 01:34:15,670
Yeah, I cracked this one on the left.

3041
01:34:15,710 --> 01:34:16,830
Yeah, but they're chasing.

3042
01:34:17,090 --> 01:34:18,150
Yeah, lucky FPS.

3043
01:34:18,390 --> 01:34:19,010
Yeah, what?

3044
01:34:19,350 --> 01:34:19,730
What?

3045
01:34:20,090 --> 01:34:20,470
What?

3046
01:34:21,410 --> 01:34:21,930
This is a different team.

3047
01:34:21,930 --> 01:34:24,750
Why are we getting contested by some random ass other team?

3048
01:34:24,950 --> 01:34:25,910
Like, hello?

3049
01:34:26,470 --> 01:34:27,050
Where's them?

3050
01:34:27,670 --> 01:34:28,050
What?

3051
01:34:29,030 --> 01:34:30,010
That's so unfortunate.

3052
01:34:30,430 --> 01:34:32,150
Oh my god, that's so unlucky.

3053
01:34:32,270 --> 01:34:34,490
We got contested by a new team.

3054
01:34:34,850 --> 01:34:35,730
I know, right?

3055
01:34:35,890 --> 01:34:38,310
What the... I mean, do you want to just, like, play around?

3056
01:34:38,730 --> 01:34:44,950
I feel like we should... I feel like we should... Should we leave it?

3057
01:34:45,450 --> 01:34:47,890
Because I feel like now everyone's just dropping on us.

3058
01:34:48,330 --> 01:34:53,390
Yeah, like, as much as I don't want to be like, yeah, we ain't no pussy ass bitches.

3059
01:34:53,690 --> 01:34:56,870
Yeah, but now we have three teams contesting us.

3060
01:34:57,670 --> 01:34:59,190
Yeah, so I'm down.

3061
01:34:59,470 --> 01:35:03,090
Let's just say, you know, y'all can, like, literally have that if you think that that's gonna help you.

3062
01:35:03,090 --> 01:35:05,490
Yeah, I mean, there's nobody in the mountains.

3063
01:35:05,610 --> 01:35:07,890
I actually don't know any of the spots, though, to be fair.

3064
01:35:08,250 --> 01:35:10,130
No, no, we can, um... let's see.

3065
01:35:10,290 --> 01:35:11,150
I'm trying to think where...

3066
01:35:11,150 --> 01:35:14,310
Yeah, yeah, this team is purposely, uh, third-partying.

3067
01:35:14,690 --> 01:35:16,710
Wait, that's a different team!

3068
01:35:16,730 --> 01:35:17,790
That's third-partying.

3069
01:35:17,970 --> 01:35:19,970
Yeah, there's so many teams out here, like, what?

3070
01:35:20,130 --> 01:35:21,390
There's so many teams trying to third-party!

3071
01:35:21,990 --> 01:35:22,430
What?

3072
01:35:22,450 --> 01:35:23,590
Wait, what are we?

3073
01:35:23,630 --> 01:35:26,270
I mean, like, are there any livestock to them?

3074
01:35:26,690 --> 01:35:27,130
Like...

3075
01:35:33,240 --> 01:35:34,780
Like, holy shit!

3076
01:35:35,360 --> 01:35:36,000
I can't believe this.

3077
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:40,760
It's like there's so many other spots to go, and everyone's like, yeah, we're just gonna, like, literally throw our game.

3078
01:35:40,960 --> 01:35:42,940
Everybody's literally landing, and that's so fucked.

3079
01:35:43,280 --> 01:35:44,860
This guy hasn't even fully healed yet.

3080
01:35:45,020 --> 01:35:45,420
Wait, what?

3081
01:35:45,720 --> 01:35:46,800
This is so fucked.

3082
01:35:47,160 --> 01:35:47,640
What?

3083
01:35:47,640 --> 01:35:51,960
Everybody, like, wants to cont... cause they're like, oh, two teams are contesting that spot.

3084
01:35:52,160 --> 01:35:55,160
We gotta... we gotta fucking contest that.

3085
01:35:55,400 --> 01:35:56,540
But, like, what?

3086
01:35:58,260 --> 01:35:58,740
Like...

3087
01:36:00,680 --> 01:36:01,900
I'm so confused.

3088
01:36:04,840 --> 01:36:05,920
I'm so confused.

3089
01:36:06,360 --> 01:36:08,040
I mean, like, what we could take?

3090
01:36:08,180 --> 01:36:09,520
Cause, like, I was looking at the map.

3091
01:36:09,720 --> 01:36:10,040
Yeah?

3092
01:36:10,260 --> 01:36:12,360
If we don't want to deal with all that cringe.

3093
01:36:12,540 --> 01:36:13,760
There is, like...

3094
01:36:14,600 --> 01:36:18,700
There are a few spots that are right outside... oh, where is ours?

3095
01:36:18,880 --> 01:36:21,440
It's, like, near Nitrodome, basically.

3096
01:36:22,960 --> 01:36:23,760
And, um...

3097
01:36:23,760 --> 01:36:25,640
Oh, there's no Way Thieves in there.

3098
01:36:25,700 --> 01:36:26,020
Exactly.

3099
01:36:26,600 --> 01:36:27,160
Wait, what?

3100
01:36:27,240 --> 01:36:28,080
I stacked it?

3101
01:36:28,160 --> 01:36:30,400
Holy shit, people already have, like, gloves and everything.

3102
01:36:31,480 --> 01:36:33,140
We can literally take all of that.

3103
01:36:33,400 --> 01:36:34,360
We can take... what?

3104
01:36:34,700 --> 01:36:35,300
People... what?

3105
01:36:35,360 --> 01:36:35,900
These players are...

3106
01:36:35,900 --> 01:36:36,620
These players are so weird.

3107
01:36:37,280 --> 01:36:38,720
Are they still there fighting?

3108
01:36:39,320 --> 01:36:42,960
Um, yeah, I'm just, like, I'm looking around the whole, like, map right now.

3109
01:36:43,440 --> 01:36:44,940
I'm trying to find...

3110
01:36:45,460 --> 01:36:46,580
Okay, Apply died.

3111
01:36:46,780 --> 01:36:47,080
Okay.

3112
01:36:47,900 --> 01:36:48,960
That's... that's all I care.

3113
01:36:50,380 --> 01:36:51,600
They ran away!

3114
01:36:52,080 --> 01:36:53,840
Day 3 and Apply, literally!

3115
01:36:54,280 --> 01:36:55,320
Oh, my God.

3116
01:36:55,420 --> 01:36:56,580
They, like, ran...

3117
01:36:56,580 --> 01:36:57,260
Oh, wait, no.

3118
01:36:57,300 --> 01:36:58,460
They, like, ran away.

3119
01:36:59,420 --> 01:37:02,440
These guys have been choosing to just fight the entire game.

3120
01:37:03,760 --> 01:37:04,420
Like, what?

3121
01:37:05,900 --> 01:37:07,040
These guys are playing pubs.

3122
01:37:07,040 --> 01:37:08,840
Wait, they actually ran away!

3123
01:37:09,440 --> 01:37:10,740
Oh, my God!

3124
01:37:11,300 --> 01:37:12,980
That is so funny.

3125
01:37:13,240 --> 01:37:14,460
Wait, is this guy seeming alive?

3126
01:37:14,820 --> 01:37:15,040
Oh, no.

3127
01:37:15,200 --> 01:37:16,220
No, they both are live.

3128
01:37:16,280 --> 01:37:17,040
They're both alive.

3129
01:37:17,380 --> 01:37:18,800
Oh, okay, okay.

3130
01:37:20,300 --> 01:37:20,820
What?

3131
01:37:21,780 --> 01:37:22,760
Oh, my God.

3132
01:37:22,800 --> 01:37:24,640
These guys actually ran...

3133
01:37:24,640 --> 01:37:27,120
This is exactly why we needed safe zones.

3134
01:37:27,380 --> 01:37:30,340
Like, to get rid of cringe like this shit.

3135
01:37:30,700 --> 01:37:31,180
Like...

3136
01:37:33,060 --> 01:37:35,880
Like, because now we are getting landed by two teams.

3137
01:37:35,900 --> 01:37:37,720
Like, holy shit.

3138
01:37:38,120 --> 01:37:44,160
Like, crazy part is that, like, we honestly, like, just need proper loot.

3139
01:37:44,280 --> 01:37:46,720
And we can literally, like, live as long as these guys can.

3140
01:37:48,420 --> 01:37:50,940
Yeah, they actually... we got contested.

3141
01:37:50,980 --> 01:37:56,600
And then, like, the team Day 3 and Apply literally ran away while we were getting contested.

3142
01:37:57,380 --> 01:37:59,300
Yeah, these guys are just kind of, like, W-keying.

3143
01:37:59,460 --> 01:38:03,540
I think they just choose a W-key instead of play for, like, placement.

3144
01:38:04,540 --> 01:38:05,920
At least the way this guy's playing.

3145
01:38:06,680 --> 01:38:07,880
Wait, who are you watching?

3146
01:38:08,240 --> 01:38:09,460
I'm watching Bucky.

3147
01:38:09,680 --> 01:38:10,040
BuckyFPS.

3148
01:38:10,040 --> 01:38:10,480
Oh, Bucky.

3149
01:38:10,520 --> 01:38:12,600
No, Bucky dies, like, 20 times yesterday.

3150
01:38:13,400 --> 01:38:15,600
Oh, yeah, because that's the guy that we killed yesterday, right?

3151
01:38:15,680 --> 01:38:19,940
No, he's... that's the guy that, like, fucking splits from his teammates just to get kills.

3152
01:38:20,020 --> 01:38:22,320
And then, like, gets rezzed.

3153
01:38:22,720 --> 01:38:23,140
Wait, what?

3154
01:38:23,140 --> 01:38:23,920
Because he literally dies.

3155
01:38:24,100 --> 01:38:26,020
Yeah, that guy died, like, 20 times...

3156
01:38:26,020 --> 01:38:27,980
Like, at least, like, 10 times in one game.

3157
01:38:28,460 --> 01:38:28,880
What the...

3158
01:38:28,880 --> 01:38:30,340
From one of the games that we were in.

3159
01:38:30,500 --> 01:38:31,980
Because I was like, he's still alive?

3160
01:38:32,100 --> 01:38:33,520
Like, I would just be watching the fucking game.

3161
01:38:33,520 --> 01:38:35,120
And I'm like, wait, he's down.

3162
01:38:35,240 --> 01:38:35,900
Wait, he's back.

3163
01:38:36,280 --> 01:38:36,820
And then...

3164
01:38:36,820 --> 01:38:38,820
Because he... it's a rebooted thing.

3165
01:38:39,180 --> 01:38:39,500
Yeah.

3166
01:38:39,860 --> 01:38:44,020
Yeah, so then he literally just kept getting rebooted to get kills.

3167
01:38:44,580 --> 01:38:45,960
That's the guy you killed last round?

3168
01:38:46,260 --> 01:38:50,300
The guy only killed me because he had his other teammate pushing me on the side.

3169
01:38:55,020 --> 01:38:56,600
Do you want to actually play a round?

3170
01:38:56,780 --> 01:38:59,620
Do you want to play, like, unrated while we're waiting?

3171
01:38:59,920 --> 01:39:00,740
Yeah, let's do it.

3172
01:39:00,840 --> 01:39:01,840
They don't deserve my views.

3173
01:39:09,040 --> 01:39:10,060
Fucing Giga-chan!

3174
01:39:10,600 --> 01:39:11,740
Giga-chan is fucked.

3175
01:39:13,060 --> 01:39:15,240
Yo, thank you for having vlogs, thank you.

3176
01:39:15,520 --> 01:39:15,620
Thank you!

3177
01:39:16,940 --> 01:39:18,320
I'm seeing this is the same skin.

3178
01:39:18,560 --> 01:39:19,500
I'm wearing this one.

3179
01:39:20,120 --> 01:39:21,180
Kill me off early.

3180
01:39:21,380 --> 01:39:22,220
I fucking am out.

3181
01:39:28,540 --> 01:39:30,480
Can we actually be able to shoot your gun?

3182
01:39:30,640 --> 01:39:32,560
And then we can actually, like, WK through this?

3183
01:39:32,560 --> 01:39:33,340
Yeah, yeah.

3184
01:39:33,740 --> 01:39:35,500
And we can use a vehicle if we want.

3185
01:39:36,100 --> 01:39:37,220
Alright, so where are we landing?

3186
01:39:38,220 --> 01:39:40,300
Um, okay, so we can practice it right now.

3187
01:39:40,560 --> 01:39:40,940
Yeah, sure.

3188
01:39:41,360 --> 01:39:43,020
Yeah, I'll ping where we're gonna go to.

3189
01:39:43,860 --> 01:39:45,080
Where's the overall stat?

3190
01:39:45,120 --> 01:39:46,100
Oh, there's the overall stat.

3191
01:39:46,160 --> 01:39:47,680
Oh yeah, we are 15th.

3192
01:39:47,680 --> 01:39:48,580
Yeah, we're in 15th.

3193
01:39:48,660 --> 01:39:49,020
Yeah.

3194
01:39:50,680 --> 01:39:51,580
They just got lucky.

3195
01:39:51,580 --> 01:39:51,700
Oh my god!

3196
01:39:51,840 --> 01:39:53,200
It's cause they're 20th!

3197
01:39:53,260 --> 01:39:53,820
That buck!

3198
01:39:54,600 --> 01:39:57,560
That team that pushed us, they were 20th place!

3199
01:39:58,720 --> 01:39:59,080
Yeah.

3200
01:39:59,080 --> 01:40:03,660
Which is like insane, cause like, doing a child like that, I mean, you know how it is in Apex.

3201
01:40:03,660 --> 01:40:05,080
It's literally a 50-50.

3202
01:40:05,320 --> 01:40:05,760
Yeah.

3203
01:40:05,760 --> 01:40:07,700
It's a matter of whoever gets lucky on their, like, loot.

3204
01:40:08,020 --> 01:40:12,220
Yeah, they literally challenged us cause they were 20th place.

3205
01:40:13,140 --> 01:40:14,800
Aren't they both pro players?

3206
01:40:15,520 --> 01:40:17,580
Yeah, they're both Overwatch players, I think?

3207
01:40:17,620 --> 01:40:20,140
No, no, I know the 20th, no, no, the buck guy.

3208
01:40:20,140 --> 01:40:20,940
Oh, the 20th?

3209
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:21,420
Oh, buck?

3210
01:40:21,420 --> 01:40:21,540
Yeah!

3211
01:40:21,580 --> 01:40:22,580
The buck guy!

3212
01:40:22,640 --> 01:40:23,840
Aren't they both pro players?

3213
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:25,920
That's embarrassing.

3214
01:40:27,780 --> 01:40:30,240
Hate to see it, VTubers are beating them.

3215
01:40:35,220 --> 01:40:36,500
That's freaking embarrassing.

3216
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:38,500
I barely shot my gun.

3217
01:40:43,620 --> 01:40:44,100
Yeah.

3218
01:40:44,300 --> 01:40:45,860
They're not as punk as we are.

3219
01:40:47,080 --> 01:40:49,600
This is... Oh, he's a tier one pro.

3220
01:40:49,700 --> 01:40:50,720
That is embarrassing.

3221
01:40:51,520 --> 01:40:52,280
Dang, what?

3222
01:40:52,440 --> 01:40:54,380
That's a tier one pro and they're doing that?

3223
01:40:54,500 --> 01:40:54,740
What?

3224
01:40:55,780 --> 01:40:56,260
Damn.

3225
01:40:56,260 --> 01:40:58,920
All I'm saying is that, like...

3226
01:41:01,400 --> 01:41:03,560
This team is literally just one player.

3227
01:41:03,840 --> 01:41:04,320
Like...

3228
01:41:05,220 --> 01:41:06,660
No, not even.

3229
01:41:07,380 --> 01:41:08,340
Not even.

3230
01:41:08,860 --> 01:41:12,480
That's what all the other Fortnite pros get for rejecting my... We are one combined brain cell.

3231
01:41:12,880 --> 01:41:14,800
...for not wanting to play with me.

3232
01:41:15,160 --> 01:41:16,060
I'm gonna drop now.

3233
01:41:16,300 --> 01:41:17,100
Alright, we're landing.

3234
01:41:17,580 --> 01:41:20,640
So, we're gonna land on... this is gonna be our spot that we can go for.

3235
01:41:20,820 --> 01:41:21,060
Oh, okay.

3236
01:41:21,060 --> 01:41:25,280
So, the nice thing is that there's, like, loot literally everywhere here and they have the heal cactuses.

3237
01:41:25,440 --> 01:41:25,900
Oh, okay.

3238
01:41:25,900 --> 01:41:27,100
So, we never get any heals.

3239
01:41:27,480 --> 01:41:29,820
We can basically get the free ones around the map.

3240
01:41:30,220 --> 01:41:31,280
So, there's...

3241
01:41:31,280 --> 01:41:32,820
So, like, nobody... who's around us?

3242
01:41:33,700 --> 01:41:36,620
Um, there's a team at Nitrodome that's gonna be there.

3243
01:41:36,780 --> 01:41:38,600
And there's gonna be a team down over here.

3244
01:41:39,520 --> 01:41:40,180
That'll be there.

3245
01:41:41,260 --> 01:41:42,460
And then, uh...

3246
01:41:42,460 --> 01:41:45,220
We have, like, a lot of free rotating space, too.

3247
01:41:45,280 --> 01:41:46,120
There's a lot of people here.

3248
01:41:47,180 --> 01:41:48,480
Oh, I did not get a gun.

3249
01:41:48,600 --> 01:41:49,380
Oh, that is...

3250
01:41:49,380 --> 01:41:49,940
Oh, that's not good.

3251
01:41:51,380 --> 01:41:52,340
I don't know.

3252
01:41:52,940 --> 01:41:54,460
I literally can't even find a gun.

3253
01:41:55,060 --> 01:41:55,940
I found a gun.

3254
01:41:56,700 --> 01:41:57,660
Oh, I'm probably dead.

3255
01:41:58,960 --> 01:41:59,560
Oh, no.

3256
01:42:02,360 --> 01:42:03,260
I hear gunshots.

3257
01:42:03,260 --> 01:42:04,380
I can't even find a gun!

3258
01:42:05,140 --> 01:42:05,580
Where are they?

3259
01:42:05,820 --> 01:42:07,240
There's literally no guns!

3260
01:42:07,260 --> 01:42:08,220
This guy's, like, on me.

3261
01:42:09,260 --> 01:42:09,880
I'm dead.

3262
01:42:10,460 --> 01:42:10,900
Woo!

3263
01:42:12,120 --> 01:42:12,560
Hey.

3264
01:42:12,560 --> 01:42:13,160
Oh, hey.

3265
01:42:13,360 --> 01:42:15,380
I'm gonna drink this potion next to you.

3266
01:42:15,460 --> 01:42:15,640
Right here?

3267
01:42:18,360 --> 01:42:19,840
Oh, he has shields already?

3268
01:42:20,420 --> 01:42:20,860
Yeah.

3269
01:42:22,420 --> 01:42:22,860
Oh.

3270
01:42:23,140 --> 01:42:24,100
I lost him.

3271
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:27,320
I'm just gonna chill in here.

3272
01:42:27,700 --> 01:42:29,540
Because, uh... I still have, like... Oh, he has shields already?

3273
01:42:29,560 --> 01:42:30,720
He has a fucking shotgun!

3274
01:42:30,920 --> 01:42:31,080
Oh!

3275
01:42:32,400 --> 01:42:34,400
Okay, I didn't realize he had a shotgun.

3276
01:42:34,900 --> 01:42:36,160
I think I'm gonna get blown up here.

3277
01:42:36,600 --> 01:42:38,500
How did he land to the...

3278
01:42:39,920 --> 01:42:42,280
Why is Wanda using C4 here?

3279
01:42:42,360 --> 01:42:43,020
What the fuck?

3280
01:42:43,380 --> 01:42:44,220
Wait, you're still alive?

3281
01:42:44,560 --> 01:42:45,500
Yeah, I'm in the trash.

3282
01:42:46,020 --> 01:42:46,780
Oh, you're a trash.

3283
01:42:47,220 --> 01:42:47,880
Oh, my God.

3284
01:42:47,880 --> 01:42:49,720
If a straight bullet hits you, you're so fucked.

3285
01:42:52,080 --> 01:42:53,060
You had no gun?

3286
01:42:53,620 --> 01:42:54,680
I literally had no gun.

3287
01:42:54,760 --> 01:42:56,820
I ran around the whole three floors of that building.

3288
01:42:57,100 --> 01:42:58,800
And there was no guns anywhere.

3289
01:42:59,560 --> 01:43:01,160
And then I got chased by the guy with the shotgun.

3290
01:43:01,680 --> 01:43:02,300
Oh, my God.

3291
01:43:02,520 --> 01:43:04,620
You almost got shot by that one guy.

3292
01:43:05,180 --> 01:43:06,700
Because of the straight bullet.

3293
01:43:07,120 --> 01:43:08,440
I don't even know how I'm alive.

3294
01:43:09,260 --> 01:43:11,600
Also, why do people land here in pubs?

3295
01:43:12,160 --> 01:43:14,020
Also, why do people land here in pubs?

3296
01:43:14,040 --> 01:43:14,580
Wait, what?

3297
01:43:14,580 --> 01:43:15,260
I'm so confused.

3298
01:43:16,760 --> 01:43:19,080
Is this like a hiding spot in the game?

3299
01:43:19,340 --> 01:43:22,160
Yeah, I'm literally just chilling in the trash.

3300
01:43:22,660 --> 01:43:22,700
Yeah, I'm literally just chilling in the trash.

3301
01:43:22,700 --> 01:43:23,700
What the fuck?

3302
01:43:24,420 --> 01:43:25,460
What the fuck?

3303
01:43:25,460 --> 01:43:25,640
What?

3304
01:43:27,760 --> 01:43:28,900
Oh, is he driving away?

3305
01:43:29,100 --> 01:43:30,880
Oh, wait.

3306
01:43:31,840 --> 01:43:32,320
Oh.

3307
01:43:34,720 --> 01:43:36,340
Why is this guy still here?

3308
01:43:36,540 --> 01:43:36,780
Yeah.

3309
01:43:37,480 --> 01:43:37,960
Leave.

3310
01:43:38,540 --> 01:43:39,980
There's nothing here.

3311
01:43:40,580 --> 01:43:41,060
Leave.

3312
01:43:43,920 --> 01:43:44,980
Oh, my God.

3313
01:43:45,220 --> 01:43:45,700
Why?

3314
01:43:47,020 --> 01:43:47,500
Why?

3315
01:43:48,500 --> 01:43:49,700
What are you doing here?

3316
01:43:49,780 --> 01:43:50,260
Leave.

3317
01:43:50,260 --> 01:43:50,740
Leave.

3318
01:43:55,150 --> 01:43:56,650
Oh, are they going to go for that?

3319
01:43:56,970 --> 01:43:58,290
Look, there's some delicious rats over there.

3320
01:43:59,670 --> 01:44:00,790
That's actually crazy.

3321
01:44:02,070 --> 01:44:03,530
That's actually crazy.

3322
01:44:03,870 --> 01:44:04,590
What the?

3323
01:44:04,830 --> 01:44:05,410
What?

3324
01:44:06,190 --> 01:44:06,770
What?

3325
01:44:06,770 --> 01:44:07,290
What?

3326
01:44:07,330 --> 01:44:07,910
What?

3327
01:44:09,470 --> 01:44:13,790
This guy is sweaty.

3328
01:44:15,010 --> 01:44:16,170
Holy shit.

3329
01:44:16,210 --> 01:44:18,670
These guys are so lucky I did not get a gun.

3330
01:44:18,770 --> 01:44:20,450
I would have absolutely destroyed them.

3331
01:44:21,090 --> 01:44:22,370
Okay, I'm ready to...

3332
01:44:23,070 --> 01:44:23,730
Alright, I'm ready to go.

3333
01:44:23,950 --> 01:44:24,950
Oh, did you ready up in there?

3334
01:44:25,170 --> 01:44:25,690
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3335
01:44:27,850 --> 01:44:29,090
I accidentally backed out.

3336
01:44:29,470 --> 01:44:30,430
Oh, wait, but you're ready.

3337
01:44:31,070 --> 01:44:31,750
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3338
01:44:32,410 --> 01:44:33,410
Wait, does this actually work?

3339
01:44:33,650 --> 01:44:34,630
Yeah, yeah, it works.

3340
01:44:34,670 --> 01:44:34,870
Yeah!

3341
01:44:35,490 --> 01:44:36,290
Are we good?

3342
01:44:36,450 --> 01:44:37,810
We're so good.

3343
01:44:40,070 --> 01:44:42,750
Okay, I'm trying to look at game four now.

3344
01:44:43,590 --> 01:44:45,950
Yeah, I'm going to see what they're doing in the tourney.

3345
01:44:46,190 --> 01:44:47,850
Game four is...

3346
01:44:48,310 --> 01:44:49,410
What is game four?

3347
01:44:50,530 --> 01:44:51,250
Fourth map.

3348
01:44:53,070 --> 01:44:53,270
Oh, it's the same.

3349
01:44:54,290 --> 01:44:54,990
Wait, what?

3350
01:44:55,270 --> 01:44:56,990
Yeah, the matches go really long.

3351
01:44:57,230 --> 01:44:58,430
Like, that's why I was like...

3352
01:44:58,430 --> 01:44:59,690
Oh, oh, bad weapons.

3353
01:45:00,750 --> 01:45:01,990
Oh, you're talking about the next one.

3354
01:45:02,450 --> 01:45:02,850
Yeah.

3355
01:45:02,870 --> 01:45:03,910
Oh, the safe zone is on!

3356
01:45:04,130 --> 01:45:04,970
Safe zone is on!

3357
01:45:05,710 --> 01:45:06,510
Oh, sweet!

3358
01:45:07,050 --> 01:45:07,730
Okay, sweet.

3359
01:45:07,810 --> 01:45:09,070
So, like, do we want to just...

3360
01:45:09,070 --> 01:45:11,410
Yeah, we should just land our safe zones on.

3361
01:45:12,050 --> 01:45:12,710
Yeah, yeah.

3362
01:45:12,830 --> 01:45:16,070
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we stay there.

3363
01:45:16,570 --> 01:45:17,310
Okay, okay.

3364
01:45:19,050 --> 01:45:20,550
We might as well if it's on.

3365
01:45:20,730 --> 01:45:20,930
We might as well if it's on.

3366
01:45:20,930 --> 01:45:22,650
Oh, Bucky just died on the...

3367
01:45:23,530 --> 01:45:24,330
Fuck you!

3368
01:45:26,450 --> 01:45:29,410
I'm pretty sure they got points, though, just because they killed the both of us.

3369
01:45:29,450 --> 01:45:29,550
I'm pretty sure they got points, though, just because they killed the both of us.

3370
01:45:29,550 --> 01:45:30,310
They got two points from that.

3371
01:45:30,670 --> 01:45:31,590
Oh, no, never mind.

3372
01:45:31,630 --> 01:45:31,970
They're alive.

3373
01:45:32,110 --> 01:45:32,370
Wait, what?

3374
01:45:32,550 --> 01:45:33,910
I thought they just said they died.

3375
01:45:35,810 --> 01:45:36,210
Confusion?

3376
01:45:40,170 --> 01:45:41,210
So, there's safe zones.

3377
01:45:42,170 --> 01:45:43,130
There's bad weapons.

3378
01:45:43,370 --> 01:45:44,690
It's just the rifles, though.

3379
01:45:44,790 --> 01:45:45,990
Only the rifles are bad.

3380
01:45:46,870 --> 01:45:47,310
Honestly...

3381
01:45:47,310 --> 01:45:48,030
Oh, all the rifles?

3382
01:45:48,290 --> 01:45:48,730
Oh, okay.

3383
01:45:48,850 --> 01:45:51,850
I don't know if it's all of them, but there's a lot of rifles in there.

3384
01:45:51,970 --> 01:45:57,750
It's the combat assault, the enforcer, the tactical, the combat, the tri-beam, and the warforged.

3385
01:45:57,830 --> 01:45:58,510
Is that all of them?

3386
01:45:59,990 --> 01:46:01,990
That's pretty much all of them.

3387
01:46:02,010 --> 01:46:03,030
Yeah, I think...

3388
01:46:03,030 --> 01:46:05,590
Oh, yeah, so it's just gonna be people sniping, then.

3389
01:46:07,790 --> 01:46:11,250
Which is already how, like, Fortnite competitive is.

3390
01:46:11,990 --> 01:46:13,210
Ba-ba-ba-ba.

3391
01:46:13,350 --> 01:46:15,310
Ba-ba-ba-ba.

3392
01:46:15,990 --> 01:46:17,190
Oh, I need to dance with you!

3393
01:46:17,270 --> 01:46:17,650
I'm coming!

3394
01:46:19,350 --> 01:46:20,510
Ba-ba-ba-ba.

3395
01:46:20,870 --> 01:46:21,970
Ba-ba-ba-ba.

3396
01:46:24,350 --> 01:46:24,750
Alright.

3397
01:46:26,230 --> 01:46:28,430
Well, I guess we go back to the ghouls.

3398
01:46:28,670 --> 01:46:30,030
Do you wanna go to Grim Gate again?

3399
01:46:30,150 --> 01:46:30,490
Yeah, yeah.

3400
01:46:31,110 --> 01:46:31,890
We might as well.

3401
01:46:32,250 --> 01:46:34,590
It's safe zone, so we should be fine.

3402
01:46:34,990 --> 01:46:35,390
Yeah.

3403
01:46:37,310 --> 01:46:38,050
Look at you!

3404
01:46:38,170 --> 01:46:39,770
You're gonna be, like, a Fortnite pro.

3405
01:46:40,010 --> 01:46:42,790
Okay, no, I'm gonna, like, stop touching Fortnite again.

3406
01:46:43,870 --> 01:46:45,410
Until there's, like, cool cosmetics.

3407
01:46:47,390 --> 01:46:48,990
Yeah, where's our other...

3408
01:46:48,990 --> 01:46:51,810
Wait, what other skin do you wanna see in this game?

3409
01:46:53,470 --> 01:46:53,910
Me.

3410
01:46:55,610 --> 01:46:57,370
Okay, will they add you in?

3411
01:46:57,490 --> 01:46:58,450
You're gonna become a Fortnite pro.

3412
01:46:58,530 --> 01:47:00,610
I will not play Fortnite until they add me in.

3413
01:47:02,750 --> 01:47:04,170
Your move, Fortnite.

3414
01:47:08,600 --> 01:47:09,040
Oh?

3415
01:47:09,580 --> 01:47:10,020
Yay!

3416
01:47:11,340 --> 01:47:12,420
Where are you landing?

3417
01:47:14,160 --> 01:47:14,840
Uh, on height.

3418
01:47:15,080 --> 01:47:15,900
I'm gonna be here.

3419
01:47:16,320 --> 01:47:17,480
Move this one chest.

3420
01:47:21,780 --> 01:47:23,360
Oh, I got a portal bunker, nice.

3421
01:47:27,340 --> 01:47:28,360
You don't need this.

3422
01:47:28,720 --> 01:47:30,040
You don't need this.

3423
01:47:30,320 --> 01:47:34,400
I believe in you, Doryu.

3424
01:47:34,780 --> 01:47:35,680
I got heals!

3425
01:47:35,920 --> 01:47:36,440
Here, do you want this?

3426
01:47:37,100 --> 01:47:38,200
Oh, here, you can top off with that.

3427
01:47:38,440 --> 01:47:39,520
Oh, okay, nice.

3428
01:47:41,760 --> 01:47:42,820
You want Nitro Splash?

3429
01:47:43,060 --> 01:47:44,120
Uh, no, I'm good.

3430
01:47:45,240 --> 01:47:47,360
I know somebody landed here with us.

3431
01:47:47,400 --> 01:47:47,560
Yeah.

3432
01:47:47,660 --> 01:47:48,920
I knocked one of them.

3433
01:47:49,080 --> 01:47:49,200
Whoa!

3434
01:47:49,400 --> 01:47:50,980
Oh my god, that scared the shit out of me.

3435
01:47:51,480 --> 01:47:53,780
Like, I know you fucking gave it to me, but...

3436
01:47:54,140 --> 01:47:55,500
I still didn't expect it.

3437
01:47:56,200 --> 01:47:57,580
Oh my god, this guy is crawling.

3438
01:47:58,040 --> 01:47:58,900
Wait, I hear somebody swimming.

3439
01:47:59,600 --> 01:48:00,520
Oh, a ghost ship!

3440
01:48:00,660 --> 01:48:01,000
Are there ghosts?

3441
01:48:01,360 --> 01:48:02,180
Oh, you got a ghost ship?

3442
01:48:02,420 --> 01:48:02,740
Yeah!

3443
01:48:03,780 --> 01:48:04,100
Yes!

3444
01:48:04,780 --> 01:48:05,700
Here's the ghost ship.

3445
01:48:08,100 --> 01:48:09,260
Wait, you know what I wanna try?

3446
01:48:09,480 --> 01:48:10,860
Oh my god, Doryu, okay, we have to sign this.

3447
01:48:11,540 --> 01:48:12,780
Okay, what is it?

3448
01:48:12,960 --> 01:48:14,720
Okay, so like, you have the ghost ship on you, right?

3449
01:48:14,900 --> 01:48:15,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3450
01:48:16,100 --> 01:48:16,540
Um...

3451
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:18,440
Stand where I am?

3452
01:48:18,720 --> 01:48:19,160
Yeah.

3453
01:48:19,660 --> 01:48:22,320
And look this exact direction that I'm looking.

3454
01:48:22,560 --> 01:48:23,360
Yeah, like here?

3455
01:48:23,360 --> 01:48:23,880
And then summon the ship.

3456
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:24,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3457
01:48:24,560 --> 01:48:25,220
Sure, I'm gonna do it.

3458
01:48:25,620 --> 01:48:26,500
Yeah, do it, do it, do it.

3459
01:48:26,860 --> 01:48:27,300
Oh!

3460
01:48:29,580 --> 01:48:30,800
Oh my god!

3461
01:48:31,640 --> 01:48:32,300
What's the size?

3462
01:48:32,300 --> 01:48:33,740
You break so much of this!

3463
01:48:33,740 --> 01:48:34,020
Yeah, I break everything.

3464
01:48:35,800 --> 01:48:37,100
Oh my god!

3465
01:48:37,120 --> 01:48:38,220
Okay, is it only one use?

3466
01:48:38,240 --> 01:48:39,980
Yeah, it's one use, so we don't have it anymore.

3467
01:48:40,320 --> 01:48:40,500
Oh!

3468
01:48:40,500 --> 01:48:43,980
Okay, I was gonna say, you could literally just destroy this whole entire area.

3469
01:48:44,560 --> 01:48:45,640
That's why it's gold.

3470
01:48:46,260 --> 01:48:48,680
Oh my god, that's insane!

3471
01:48:50,220 --> 01:48:52,720
Okay, alright, noted, noted.

3472
01:48:53,820 --> 01:48:54,940
They didn't ban that.

3473
01:48:55,300 --> 01:48:57,800
Yeah, they didn't ban that, but they banned the guns.

3474
01:48:58,040 --> 01:48:59,240
They didn't ban any of the...

3475
01:48:59,240 --> 01:49:01,000
They didn't ban any of the...

3476
01:49:02,080 --> 01:49:02,600
Uh...

3477
01:49:03,220 --> 01:49:04,880
Literally any of the fists.

3478
01:49:06,160 --> 01:49:07,320
Oh, that's true too.

3479
01:49:07,380 --> 01:49:09,440
You can still use the magneto gloves.

3480
01:49:09,640 --> 01:49:10,000
Yeah, yeah.

3481
01:49:10,860 --> 01:49:12,440
Everyone's just gonna be running that then.

3482
01:49:13,420 --> 01:49:16,900
It's gonna be like magneto gloves Um...

3483
01:49:16,900 --> 01:49:18,460
There's your port pair torch.

3484
01:49:19,460 --> 01:49:23,240
The nitro gloves, and then people just sniping.

3485
01:49:26,260 --> 01:49:27,300
Thank you, Tyson!

3486
01:49:29,580 --> 01:49:30,740
Uh, okay.

3487
01:49:31,320 --> 01:49:31,880
So...

3488
01:49:33,140 --> 01:49:36,120
I wonder if it will be a guaranteed spawn?

3489
01:49:37,120 --> 01:49:37,960
At like...

3490
01:49:39,140 --> 01:49:40,840
One POI for the...

3491
01:49:41,120 --> 01:49:41,640
The ship?

3492
01:49:41,980 --> 01:49:42,840
The ship, yeah.

3493
01:49:42,860 --> 01:49:44,100
I think I've been getting a lot of the ship.

3494
01:49:45,360 --> 01:49:46,960
Can you imagine we make it closer to end zone?

3495
01:49:47,200 --> 01:49:48,820
And then you basically use that?

3496
01:49:49,080 --> 01:49:49,360
Yeah!

3497
01:49:50,460 --> 01:49:52,900
Okay, only if we survive.

3498
01:49:53,380 --> 01:49:54,480
We gotta survive.

3499
01:49:54,780 --> 01:49:58,340
We still need to survive to do that.

3500
01:49:58,560 --> 01:49:59,940
We can definitely do it.

3501
01:50:00,260 --> 01:50:02,860
I don't know, that's the only issue.

3502
01:50:03,220 --> 01:50:04,440
We just gotta live.

3503
01:50:05,120 --> 01:50:08,640
If zone pulls to us, I think it's very possible.

3504
01:50:08,860 --> 01:50:09,840
I'm pretty confident.

3505
01:50:10,720 --> 01:50:12,540
Cause we can carry...

3506
01:50:12,540 --> 01:50:14,600
You know, everyone's gonna be using bunkers and stuff.

3507
01:50:14,640 --> 01:50:15,020
Yeah, yeah.

3508
01:50:15,160 --> 01:50:16,680
Like we literally just throw the ship down.

3509
01:50:16,960 --> 01:50:18,260
Yeah, that's all we gotta do is throw it.

3510
01:50:18,260 --> 01:50:20,620
Yeah, we gotta stay in the portabunker.

3511
01:50:20,820 --> 01:50:21,700
Wait until...

3512
01:50:22,760 --> 01:50:24,080
It's almost end zone.

3513
01:50:24,160 --> 01:50:25,240
And then just throw the ship down.

3514
01:50:26,280 --> 01:50:27,580
Okay, I'm with it.

3515
01:50:27,620 --> 01:50:28,220
I'm with this plan.

3516
01:50:28,380 --> 01:50:30,060
Okay, so we're gonna try to find a ship.

3517
01:50:30,240 --> 01:50:31,540
How many can you have in your inventory?

3518
01:50:31,680 --> 01:50:32,240
Can you have multiple?

3519
01:50:32,540 --> 01:50:33,440
Um, I don't know.

3520
01:50:33,480 --> 01:50:35,020
I never got a chance to have multiple.

3521
01:50:36,400 --> 01:50:37,540
I've only found one.

3522
01:50:38,280 --> 01:50:40,620
Well, we are gonna try to see if we can find multiple.

3523
01:50:40,900 --> 01:50:42,380
Maybe it's a Pirates of the Caribbean.

3524
01:50:42,540 --> 01:50:44,400
A Pirates of the Caribbean map would have one too, maybe.

3525
01:50:45,140 --> 01:50:46,040
Oh, that's right!

3526
01:50:46,180 --> 01:50:47,300
I haven't even gone to that area yet.

3527
01:50:47,320 --> 01:50:47,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3528
01:50:50,040 --> 01:50:52,680
I'm gonna mod the car so you can actually get a turret on it.

3529
01:50:53,600 --> 01:50:54,000
Oh!

3530
01:50:55,020 --> 01:50:55,600
Oh, yeah!

3531
01:50:56,060 --> 01:50:58,160
That's how we saw it from the first game.

3532
01:50:58,660 --> 01:51:00,220
Which I wasn't even doing before.

3533
01:51:00,280 --> 01:51:02,740
I feel bad cause I never got a chance to shoot it.

3534
01:51:03,940 --> 01:51:04,500
It's okay.

3535
01:51:04,580 --> 01:51:05,860
It was just not meant to be.

3536
01:51:06,260 --> 01:51:07,700
No, it's off-road tires.

3537
01:51:08,140 --> 01:51:09,620
It was just not meant to be.

3538
01:51:11,020 --> 01:51:12,160
This time though...

3539
01:51:12,540 --> 01:51:13,260
Oh, it's over.

3540
01:51:14,660 --> 01:51:15,300
Oh, shit!

3541
01:51:16,580 --> 01:51:17,660
Is he gonna shoot us?

3542
01:51:18,500 --> 01:51:18,980
They should!

3543
01:51:19,760 --> 01:51:20,920
I'm not trying to get a gun.

3544
01:51:22,220 --> 01:51:23,300
Okay, let's get a gun on him.

3545
01:51:23,420 --> 01:51:25,200
Oh my god, he's shooting at us!

3546
01:51:26,680 --> 01:51:28,380
I can't do anything about it!

3547
01:51:28,500 --> 01:51:29,360
I got a turret!

3548
01:51:29,760 --> 01:51:30,080
Oh!

3549
01:51:34,880 --> 01:51:35,520
Holy shit!

3550
01:51:36,880 --> 01:51:38,980
Wait, I think he might kill our car before I get in!

3551
01:51:38,980 --> 01:51:39,980
I think he's gonna kill our car.

3552
01:51:40,040 --> 01:51:41,020
We have to get out of here.

3553
01:51:42,300 --> 01:51:42,960
Okay, I'm out.

3554
01:51:43,040 --> 01:51:43,180
I'm out.

3555
01:51:43,260 --> 01:51:43,340
I'm out.

3556
01:51:43,480 --> 01:51:43,500
I'm out.

3557
01:51:45,060 --> 01:51:45,880
I wasn't out.

3558
01:51:45,960 --> 01:51:49,060
I was not out, but now I am.

3559
01:51:49,180 --> 01:51:50,200
Now I am.

3560
01:51:55,060 --> 01:51:57,220
Is he literally still trying to shoot us?

3561
01:51:59,000 --> 01:51:59,940
Oh, shit!

3562
01:52:00,880 --> 01:52:02,120
It's a pirate ship!

3563
01:52:02,520 --> 01:52:06,000
Holy shit, he got up just to shoot us!

3564
01:52:06,220 --> 01:52:07,320
Yo, what the?

3565
01:52:09,500 --> 01:52:10,240
Where is he?

3566
01:52:10,320 --> 01:52:10,740
Oh, I see him.

3567
01:52:10,800 --> 01:52:11,020
I see him.

3568
01:52:11,640 --> 01:52:13,160
Oh, it's Jack Sparrow!

3569
01:52:13,680 --> 01:52:16,200
Oh my god, it's Jack Sparrow Jack Sparrow and Barbossa!

3570
01:52:16,440 --> 01:52:17,240
No, not Barbossa.

3571
01:52:17,660 --> 01:52:19,300
The other guy!

3572
01:52:25,400 --> 01:52:26,700
It's the other guy.

3573
01:52:27,240 --> 01:52:28,140
That dude.

3574
01:52:28,400 --> 01:52:29,060
The one guy.

3575
01:52:32,520 --> 01:52:34,140
We didn't need you.

3576
01:52:36,120 --> 01:52:45,780
Guys, I'm not a fake fan because I stopped watching it when Jack Sparrow and when Orlando Bloom stopped being in it, so I'm not a fake fan, guys.

3577
01:52:46,020 --> 01:52:48,200
I actually forgot that Orlando Bloom wasn't in it anymore.

3578
01:52:48,300 --> 01:52:49,180
Was it the fourth movie?

3579
01:52:49,220 --> 01:52:52,720
Yeah, it was when he became Davy Jones.

3580
01:52:53,300 --> 01:52:55,620
Oh, I forgot about that.

3581
01:52:55,700 --> 01:52:56,860
Why is it purple glowing?

3582
01:52:57,020 --> 01:52:57,860
Did you grab the...

3583
01:52:57,860 --> 01:52:59,780
Did you already grab the... The gloves?

3584
01:53:00,020 --> 01:53:00,400
Yeah, yeah.

3585
01:53:00,400 --> 01:53:01,040
Yeah, do you want them?

3586
01:53:01,240 --> 01:53:03,940
No, no, it was weird because the purple is still there.

3587
01:53:04,620 --> 01:53:05,100
Oh.

3588
01:53:05,320 --> 01:53:12,680
Yeah, I'm not a fake fan because I actually stopped watching the movies after they replaced Orlando Bloom.

3589
01:53:15,440 --> 01:53:18,340
Because it wasn't a good movie after that.

3590
01:53:20,500 --> 01:53:24,940
They're like, yeah, we gotta like throw in the not proper actor for this movie.

3591
01:53:25,320 --> 01:53:27,560
And our numbers are gonna do just fine.

3592
01:53:27,700 --> 01:53:28,540
Aaron will be okay.

3593
01:53:29,620 --> 01:53:31,160
I'm gonna see where this guy died at.

3594
01:53:31,160 --> 01:53:37,040
No, that's not true because there was that other girl who I forgot the name of because she wasn't as important as Orlando Bloom.

3595
01:53:37,280 --> 01:53:39,000
But like, she also...

3596
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:40,120
Yeah, yeah, her.

3597
01:53:40,640 --> 01:53:42,520
She was also equally...

3598
01:53:43,820 --> 01:53:45,860
important, but not that important to me.

3599
01:53:49,840 --> 01:53:50,980
What was this guy doing?

3600
01:53:51,940 --> 01:53:52,740
What was this guy doing?

3601
01:53:52,740 --> 01:53:53,720
He's trying to get me over!

3602
01:53:54,940 --> 01:53:55,560
He's trying to get me over!

3603
01:53:55,560 --> 01:53:56,640
That's what he was trying to do!

3604
01:53:57,540 --> 01:53:58,380
What the fuck?

3605
01:53:58,440 --> 01:53:59,040
Wait, they're gone!

3606
01:53:59,460 --> 01:54:01,180
Wait, what's the... Oh wait, the Nitro Fist!

3607
01:54:01,600 --> 01:54:02,620
Yeah, those are the...

3608
01:54:02,620 --> 01:54:03,800
Do you wanna be Doomfist?

3609
01:54:04,180 --> 01:54:05,080
Yeah, yeah, that's Doomfist.

3610
01:54:05,240 --> 01:54:05,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3611
01:54:05,720 --> 01:54:06,200
I got it.

3612
01:54:06,220 --> 01:54:06,600
I got one.

3613
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:08,180
Okay, okay, okay.

3614
01:54:09,080 --> 01:54:10,340
You wanna go to the pirate area?

3615
01:54:10,340 --> 01:54:11,100
Sure, sure.

3616
01:54:11,600 --> 01:54:12,840
I'm not been there yet.

3617
01:54:13,400 --> 01:54:14,480
Other than like...

3618
01:54:15,120 --> 01:54:15,920
when we...

3619
01:54:15,920 --> 01:54:19,760
Okay, left click is forward, alright.

3620
01:54:20,300 --> 01:54:24,880
Yeah, when you're in the air, left click launches you up, or launches you in the air.

3621
01:54:25,060 --> 01:54:27,140
And then right click is an uppercut.

3622
01:54:27,400 --> 01:54:27,840
Okay.

3623
01:54:28,620 --> 01:54:30,940
They must have got this pirate ship from here then.

3624
01:54:31,560 --> 01:54:34,720
Cause like, Davy Jones had a pirate ship.

3625
01:54:35,240 --> 01:54:37,020
Oh, wait, I wonder if they sell it.

3626
01:54:37,120 --> 01:54:37,880
Do you think they sell it here?

3627
01:54:37,880 --> 01:54:40,080
Wait, wait, there's a car coming over to us.

3628
01:54:40,140 --> 01:54:40,880
You have magneto gloves.

3629
01:54:41,080 --> 01:54:41,560
Get him.

3630
01:54:41,640 --> 01:54:42,120
Yeah!

3631
01:54:42,160 --> 01:54:43,080
Oh, I'm getting this.

3632
01:54:43,300 --> 01:54:43,920
Get him.

3633
01:54:44,040 --> 01:54:44,180
Get him.

3634
01:54:44,600 --> 01:54:45,080
Yeah!

3635
01:54:45,320 --> 01:54:46,020
Get him!

3636
01:54:47,620 --> 01:54:49,360
Oh, you think you can do that?

3637
01:54:49,700 --> 01:54:51,740
And what the... That's fucking right.

3638
01:54:51,800 --> 01:54:52,780
I'm gonna fucking speed up.

3639
01:54:52,900 --> 01:54:53,180
Oh!

3640
01:54:53,340 --> 01:54:54,480
He's trying to beat me up too!

3641
01:54:54,900 --> 01:54:55,340
Oh shit!

3642
01:54:55,560 --> 01:54:55,900
Oh!

3643
01:54:56,620 --> 01:54:58,280
He beat me up!

3644
01:54:58,900 --> 01:55:00,320
What the fuck!

3645
01:55:00,320 --> 01:55:01,000
The Joker!

3646
01:55:01,800 --> 01:55:03,620
Wait, the Joker killed me!

3647
01:55:05,860 --> 01:55:06,820
Oh shit!

3648
01:55:07,280 --> 01:55:07,860
Oh shit!

3649
01:55:07,880 --> 01:55:11,220
The Joker destroyed me!

3650
01:55:11,760 --> 01:55:13,360
Oh my god!

3651
01:55:14,640 --> 01:55:15,660
Wait, did this...

3652
01:55:15,660 --> 01:55:17,040
Are they still alive?

3653
01:55:17,380 --> 01:55:17,800
Oh, they are!

3654
01:55:17,880 --> 01:55:19,260
Yeah, he's trying to save his TV.

3655
01:55:19,360 --> 01:55:20,460
He's trying to save his TV right now.

3656
01:55:20,600 --> 01:55:21,780
Holy fuck!

3657
01:55:22,420 --> 01:55:24,000
I can't believe it!

3658
01:55:24,040 --> 01:55:25,460
The Joker got me!

3659
01:55:25,980 --> 01:55:27,240
Wait, they're dying!

3660
01:55:27,360 --> 01:55:28,100
There's another team!

3661
01:55:28,300 --> 01:55:29,200
No, no, there's another team!

3662
01:55:29,440 --> 01:55:32,400
Just like the cat in his head!

3663
01:55:32,700 --> 01:55:34,980
You Thanos, you gotta get revenge!

3664
01:55:35,360 --> 01:55:37,040
You gotta kill the Joker!

3665
01:55:37,880 --> 01:55:39,940
You gotta kill the Joker, Thanos!

3666
01:55:45,380 --> 01:55:46,280
Where is he?

3667
01:55:47,320 --> 01:55:48,580
Oh, they died!

3668
01:55:48,760 --> 01:55:50,820
Okay, apparently they died!

3669
01:55:50,820 --> 01:55:51,660
Oh, thank god!

3670
01:55:51,760 --> 01:55:52,640
Okay, get me back!

3671
01:55:53,260 --> 01:55:54,580
I got you, I got you!

3672
01:55:55,120 --> 01:55:56,940
Oh my god, this seems so horny for me!

3673
01:55:58,220 --> 01:55:59,100
Holy shit!

3674
01:55:59,460 --> 01:56:02,520
I can't believe the Joker killed me!

3675
01:56:02,940 --> 01:56:04,360
Why are they chasing me?

3676
01:56:04,660 --> 01:56:07,300
There's a very fun team you can go kill over there.

3677
01:56:07,380 --> 01:56:08,740
Yeah, go get those guys!

3678
01:56:12,060 --> 01:56:13,380
Okay, I got you, I got you!

3679
01:56:13,480 --> 01:56:14,220
Oh, thank god!

3680
01:56:14,640 --> 01:56:15,900
This is our spot!

3681
01:56:18,300 --> 01:56:19,840
It's not illegal, Batman!

3682
01:56:30,620 --> 01:56:31,580
Live, Doki!

3683
01:56:31,800 --> 01:56:32,460
I'm back!

3684
01:56:34,720 --> 01:56:35,660
I'm back!

3685
01:56:35,680 --> 01:56:36,500
You're back, bitches!

3686
01:56:36,500 --> 01:56:36,960
You're back, bitches!

3687
01:56:38,150 --> 01:56:39,600
The Joker who laughs!

3688
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:41,520
That's right, I outlived Joker!

3689
01:56:42,220 --> 01:56:44,040
I literally outlived him!

3690
01:56:44,260 --> 01:56:44,880
What the?

3691
01:56:45,140 --> 01:56:46,900
What the fuck?!

3692
01:56:46,900 --> 01:56:50,140
I just got here!

3693
01:56:51,920 --> 01:56:53,900
That's so fucked up!

3694
01:56:54,760 --> 01:56:55,080
That's so fucked up!

3695
01:56:55,080 --> 01:56:55,200
Live!

3696
01:56:56,250 --> 01:56:58,000
You killed my teammate!

3697
01:57:00,580 --> 01:57:02,140
I'm sorry!

3698
01:57:02,140 --> 01:57:02,320
Yeah!

3699
01:57:02,600 --> 01:57:04,380
I give shit on nerds!

3700
01:57:04,380 --> 01:57:05,320
I got you!

3701
01:57:05,660 --> 01:57:07,820
I literally lived for five!

3702
01:57:07,980 --> 01:57:08,900
I got gold, though!

3703
01:57:09,060 --> 01:57:10,280
I got money!

3704
01:57:10,940 --> 01:57:12,860
I literally was like...

3705
01:57:12,860 --> 01:57:15,640
I literally spawned in and died!

3706
01:57:15,760 --> 01:57:18,060
What the fuck is wrong with these people?

3707
01:57:19,700 --> 01:57:20,960
Here, I'm gonna give you this!

3708
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:21,780
I have this, yeah.

3709
01:57:22,220 --> 01:57:23,260
There you go, there you go.

3710
01:57:23,800 --> 01:57:25,000
Make it rain!

3711
01:57:25,920 --> 01:57:27,440
Make it rain!

3712
01:57:28,740 --> 01:57:30,240
Did you already get gloves?

3713
01:57:30,460 --> 01:57:30,760
No.

3714
01:57:31,160 --> 01:57:31,700
Okay.

3715
01:57:31,700 --> 01:57:32,540
Yeah, you can take it out.

3716
01:57:33,120 --> 01:57:34,380
Wait, there's a car here.

3717
01:57:34,980 --> 01:57:37,400
What the fuck?!

3718
01:57:37,400 --> 01:57:39,780
Oh no, I might die.

3719
01:57:40,360 --> 01:57:41,860
No, you're good, you're good, you're good.

3720
01:57:43,640 --> 01:57:44,360
Oh god.

3721
01:57:45,960 --> 01:57:46,440
No.

3722
01:57:46,440 --> 01:57:47,640
I don't feel good.

3723
01:57:47,900 --> 01:57:48,860
They left, they left.

3724
01:57:48,860 --> 01:57:49,640
I don't feel good.

3725
01:57:50,680 --> 01:57:52,440
I don't feel so good.

3726
01:57:53,120 --> 01:57:55,800
I don't feel so good for you.

3727
01:57:57,160 --> 01:57:58,920
Doki, have you seen a dog?

3728
01:57:58,980 --> 01:57:59,880
Doki, have you seen a dog?

3729
01:57:59,880 --> 01:58:00,140
No!

3730
01:58:01,960 --> 01:58:02,400
Doki!

3731
01:58:03,300 --> 01:58:06,520
Woah, woah, woah, woah, there's a car in front of me.

3732
01:58:06,540 --> 01:58:06,900
There's a car in front of you.

3733
01:58:07,840 --> 01:58:09,720
Oh, woah, woah, woah.

3734
01:58:10,320 --> 01:58:11,400
Oh, woah, woah.

3735
01:58:11,500 --> 01:58:12,860
There's so many things.

3736
01:58:13,240 --> 01:58:14,640
Oh, the car is coming!

3737
01:58:15,640 --> 01:58:17,400
Oh shit, I'm coming Doki!

3738
01:58:17,560 --> 01:58:18,140
I'm coming!

3739
01:58:21,180 --> 01:58:21,740
Oh god.

3740
01:58:21,840 --> 01:58:22,960
You're living, you're living, you're living.

3741
01:58:23,140 --> 01:58:24,920
I'm fucking trying my best.

3742
01:58:25,340 --> 01:58:27,620
You're so alive, I've never seen you more alive.

3743
01:58:28,900 --> 01:58:29,520
Oh god.

3744
01:58:29,580 --> 01:58:30,020
Thank god.

3745
01:58:30,220 --> 01:58:31,000
Oh thank god.

3746
01:58:32,480 --> 01:58:33,560
Oh thank god.

3747
01:58:34,080 --> 01:58:35,240
Oh thank god.

3748
01:58:36,300 --> 01:58:37,740
Don't look at me, please.

3749
01:58:38,320 --> 01:58:39,460
Don't look at me.

3750
01:58:40,400 --> 01:58:40,920
Oh.

3751
01:58:41,520 --> 01:58:42,280
I'm here.

3752
01:58:42,480 --> 01:58:43,760
I found so many medkits.

3753
01:58:44,040 --> 01:58:45,180
I'm here Doki.

3754
01:58:45,300 --> 01:58:47,340
I'm okay, I feel so alive.

3755
01:58:47,560 --> 01:58:49,580
I've never felt so alive in my life.

3756
01:58:49,960 --> 01:58:50,800
We're here.

3757
01:58:50,880 --> 01:58:51,280
I'm here.

3758
01:58:51,860 --> 01:58:53,020
We're so alive.

3759
01:58:55,020 --> 01:58:56,400
You wanna get the Baja Blast?

3760
01:58:56,980 --> 01:58:58,660
Yeah, let's go get some Baja Blast.

3761
01:58:58,660 --> 01:58:59,700
Let's go get some Baja Blast.

3762
01:58:59,700 --> 01:58:59,800
Let's go get some Baja Blast.

3763
01:59:03,120 --> 01:59:04,500
So how was that adventure?

3764
01:59:04,840 --> 01:59:05,200
So how was that adventure?

3765
01:59:05,200 --> 01:59:07,200
I'm gonna go for this thing right now, real quick.

3766
01:59:07,880 --> 01:59:08,440
Yay!

3767
01:59:08,820 --> 01:59:09,980
Is someone shooting at you?

3768
01:59:10,140 --> 01:59:11,760
Oh no, that's other dudes.

3769
01:59:12,500 --> 01:59:15,560
I've been trying not to look behind me.

3770
01:59:17,560 --> 01:59:18,120
I've been trying not to look behind me.

3771
01:59:18,120 --> 01:59:19,060
Never look back, Doki.

3772
01:59:19,060 --> 01:59:20,780
If I don't look, they don't exist.

3773
01:59:21,300 --> 01:59:22,320
Never look back.

3774
01:59:22,880 --> 01:59:23,920
Oh hey, Nuka Cola.

3775
01:59:24,300 --> 01:59:26,180
Nuka Cola, Nuka Cola.

3776
01:59:28,060 --> 01:59:28,740
I'll grab this.

3777
01:59:28,860 --> 01:59:29,640
I'm gonna grab a Nuka Cola.

3778
01:59:29,700 --> 01:59:30,520
I'm gonna pop it right now.

3779
01:59:32,160 --> 01:59:33,040
I have Nitro.

3780
01:59:33,080 --> 01:59:33,560
Do you want Nitro?

3781
01:59:35,040 --> 01:59:35,640
No, I'm good.

3782
01:59:35,800 --> 01:59:36,920
Oh okay, nevermind.

3783
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:37,640
I guess I'm not good.

3784
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:39,880
Oh there's people here.

3785
01:59:41,220 --> 01:59:41,560
What the?

3786
01:59:42,160 --> 01:59:42,760
They're going up.

3787
01:59:43,380 --> 01:59:44,120
Doki, come over here.

3788
01:59:45,240 --> 01:59:46,440
We're gonna go in this together, okay?

3789
01:59:46,540 --> 01:59:46,600
Yeah.

3790
01:59:49,660 --> 01:59:51,260
And then there's dudes like right here.

3791
01:59:51,380 --> 01:59:51,880
Let's line right here.

3792
01:59:52,400 --> 01:59:54,260
Alright, I'm in.

3793
01:59:57,560 --> 01:59:58,220
What the?

3794
01:59:58,660 --> 01:59:59,840
What the fuck?

3795
02:00:01,740 --> 02:00:02,340
You're good.

3796
02:00:02,380 --> 02:00:02,740
He's one.

3797
02:00:03,240 --> 02:00:04,160
No, I missed.

3798
02:00:04,520 --> 02:00:06,460
Wait, is he gonna die from fall damage?

3799
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:07,780
No, no, no.

3800
02:00:09,040 --> 02:00:10,240
Wait, I got him.

3801
02:00:10,320 --> 02:00:10,780
He's knocked.

3802
02:00:11,120 --> 02:00:12,480
Where's his teammate?

3803
02:00:13,740 --> 02:00:14,700
Wait, what the fuck?

3804
02:00:14,720 --> 02:00:15,640
He rode all the way up.

3805
02:00:16,060 --> 02:00:17,040
He had footsteps.

3806
02:00:18,460 --> 02:00:19,060
I'm here.

3807
02:00:19,460 --> 02:00:20,560
His teammates are here.

3808
02:00:22,040 --> 02:00:23,220
Fuck you, I'm gonna fist you.

3809
02:00:27,620 --> 02:00:30,880
I didn't kill you, but I'm gonna fist you just for the sake of it.

3810
02:00:32,360 --> 02:00:33,160
Where did he go?

3811
02:00:33,760 --> 02:00:34,780
Oh, he's like over here.

3812
02:00:38,640 --> 02:00:41,980
Hey, I messed up my fists.

3813
02:00:46,060 --> 02:00:47,820
I could've killed him off in time.

3814
02:00:47,820 --> 02:00:47,900
Oh my god.

3815
02:00:49,760 --> 02:00:50,160
Oh my god.

3816
02:00:50,380 --> 02:00:51,500
We are believing.

3817
02:00:55,920 --> 02:00:57,600
We died from fall damage.

3818
02:00:58,000 --> 02:00:59,120
I'm coming, I'm coming.

3819
02:00:59,360 --> 02:00:59,660
I'm coming, I'm coming.

3820
02:01:00,560 --> 02:01:01,780
Where are you?

3821
02:01:02,200 --> 02:01:02,800
I'm above.

3822
02:01:03,040 --> 02:01:04,680
I'm getting shot by some other team.

3823
02:01:04,680 --> 02:01:05,480
They're being really ugly.

3824
02:01:05,820 --> 02:01:05,820
Oh my god.

3825
02:01:05,920 --> 02:01:07,160
Oh wait, the code's up.

3826
02:01:07,320 --> 02:01:08,300
The code's up.

3827
02:01:08,460 --> 02:01:09,680
Oh shit, the code's up.

3828
02:01:09,700 --> 02:01:10,020
Oh shit, the code's up.

3829
02:01:10,020 --> 02:01:10,520
We should leave.

3830
02:01:10,600 --> 02:01:10,880
We should leave.

3831
02:01:10,940 --> 02:01:11,220
We should leave.

3832
02:01:11,760 --> 02:01:13,040
Actually, let me die in the same.

3833
02:01:13,040 --> 02:01:13,640
Okay, okay.

3834
02:01:14,620 --> 02:01:15,340
I left.

3835
02:01:15,480 --> 02:01:15,900
I left.

3836
02:01:15,960 --> 02:01:16,820
Oh, I left already.

3837
02:01:17,320 --> 02:01:19,080
The code's been up for three.

3838
02:01:19,240 --> 02:01:20,520
Oh my god, it's been up for three.

3839
02:01:21,180 --> 02:01:22,360
Wait, did we miss it?

3840
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:25,160
Did we miss it?

3841
02:01:25,600 --> 02:01:26,220
No, no, no.

3842
02:01:26,220 --> 02:01:26,420
We're good.

3843
02:01:26,640 --> 02:01:26,800
We're good.

3844
02:01:26,840 --> 02:01:28,480
Okay, I'm claiming stuff.

3845
02:01:28,800 --> 02:01:29,160
Okay.

3846
02:01:30,040 --> 02:01:30,700
Are we good?

3847
02:01:31,840 --> 02:01:33,300
Uh, they haven't said anything yet.

3848
02:01:33,380 --> 02:01:34,100
They haven't said anything yet.

3849
02:01:34,120 --> 02:01:34,380
We're good.

3850
02:01:34,460 --> 02:01:34,740
We're good.

3851
02:01:34,980 --> 02:01:35,560
Wait, did you?

3852
02:01:35,600 --> 02:01:36,160
I readied up.

3853
02:01:36,340 --> 02:01:37,180
I readied up.

3854
02:01:37,260 --> 02:01:37,600
Okay, you readied up.

3855
02:01:37,600 --> 02:01:37,900
Readied up.

3856
02:01:37,900 --> 02:01:38,420
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3857
02:01:39,040 --> 02:01:39,400
Okay.

3858
02:01:40,300 --> 02:01:42,280
Alright, let's bring Goku and Vegeta in.

3859
02:01:42,680 --> 02:01:43,080
Okay.

3860
02:01:45,500 --> 02:01:46,280
Alright, we're good.

3861
02:01:46,420 --> 02:01:46,940
We're good.

3862
02:01:47,020 --> 02:01:47,460
We're good.

3863
02:01:47,460 --> 02:01:47,860
We're good.

3864
02:01:47,880 --> 02:01:48,220
We're good.

3865
02:01:48,360 --> 02:01:50,140
They didn't notice, guys.

3866
02:01:50,220 --> 02:01:52,060
They didn't notice.

3867
02:01:52,440 --> 02:01:56,140
You know how Goku out to get some to go off right now?

3868
02:01:56,200 --> 02:01:56,660

3869
02:01:57,140 --> 02:01:57,900
So you gonna wear Goku?

3870
02:01:58,160 --> 02:01:58,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3871
02:01:58,800 --> 02:01:59,600
You want me to wear Bulma?

3872
02:02:00,080 --> 02:02:01,200
Oh, Bulma or Vegeta?

3873
02:02:01,760 --> 02:02:02,440
I'll be Vegeta.

3874
02:02:02,720 --> 02:02:03,160
I'll be...

3875
02:02:03,160 --> 02:02:04,480
Oh my god, they don't know.

3876
02:02:04,620 --> 02:02:04,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3877
02:02:04,720 --> 02:02:05,040

3878
02:02:05,160 --> 02:02:06,200
They don't know.

3879
02:02:06,280 --> 02:02:07,020
I'll have a big-ass forehead.

3880
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:09,900
They never, they never know.

3881
02:02:10,280 --> 02:02:11,900
They didn't know they were waiting for us.

3882
02:02:11,960 --> 02:02:13,080
We're too busy fisting.

3883
02:02:13,260 --> 02:02:15,860
I purposely died there, chat, cause I knew.

3884
02:02:16,040 --> 02:02:18,080
I saw the, I saw the notification.

3885
02:02:18,460 --> 02:02:18,900
Yeah?

3886
02:02:18,900 --> 02:02:23,840
So I was like, looking at my Discord when I was following, and I was like, oh, and then I purposely died.

3887
02:02:24,140 --> 02:02:27,700
Cause I knew that if I died, we could leave the lobby.

3888
02:02:32,660 --> 02:02:34,860
Jay wants to fight you both to the death.

3889
02:02:35,880 --> 02:02:37,000
Jay wants to fight you both to the death.

3890
02:02:37,020 --> 02:02:38,020
Jay wants to fight us to the death.

3891
02:02:38,360 --> 02:02:38,880
Wait, what?

3892
02:02:39,440 --> 02:02:39,800
Yeah.

3893
02:02:39,840 --> 02:02:40,080
Where?

3894
02:02:40,680 --> 02:02:42,520
I don't know, that's what some of my chat said.

3895
02:02:43,500 --> 02:02:44,940
Oh, cause I was shit talking?

3896
02:02:46,780 --> 02:02:48,280
They just want to fight us to the death.

3897
02:02:53,500 --> 02:02:55,000
Safe zone, you idiots.

3898
02:02:55,080 --> 02:02:55,900
You can't.

3899
02:02:56,200 --> 02:02:58,120
You guys are in 18th and Jay's in 19th.

3900
02:02:58,140 --> 02:03:02,160
Well, if they do, then they get minus 10 points, and then we like say extra good.

3901
02:03:02,160 --> 02:03:06,340
You know what, say yes and then, and then so they can get minus 10 points.

3902
02:03:12,020 --> 02:03:13,220
Oh, we're going in!

3903
02:03:13,300 --> 02:03:13,860
We're going in!

3904
02:03:14,200 --> 02:03:14,220
Oh, we're going in!

3905
02:03:16,260 --> 02:03:17,400
We agree to it, Ninja.

3906
02:03:17,480 --> 02:03:19,560
We just let them kill us, so they lose 10 points.

3907
02:03:20,520 --> 02:03:20,920
Ew.

3908
02:03:21,200 --> 02:03:22,320
Is that Blue Condom?

3909
02:03:23,040 --> 02:03:23,840
Yeah, that's them.

3910
02:03:23,920 --> 02:03:24,380
That's them.

3911
02:03:24,560 --> 02:03:25,600
They're monkeys.

3912
02:03:25,880 --> 02:03:26,260
That's them.

3913
02:03:27,320 --> 02:03:27,980
They're the monkeys.

3914
02:03:29,860 --> 02:03:31,980
Wait, can you...

3915
02:03:32,420 --> 02:03:34,140
Oh, they all bought the fucking...

3916
02:03:37,520 --> 02:03:39,740
The condoms are blue now.

3917
02:03:39,920 --> 02:03:40,500
The condoms are blue now.

3918
02:03:41,100 --> 02:03:42,260
Where is it?

3919
02:03:42,660 --> 02:03:43,720
Oh, it's over here.

3920
02:03:43,860 --> 02:03:46,880
Okay, we can't...

3921
02:03:46,880 --> 02:03:48,720
No until...

3922
02:03:48,720 --> 02:03:50,180
Until Zone 2, I think.

3923
02:03:50,820 --> 02:03:53,020
Yeah, yeah.

3924
02:03:53,080 --> 02:03:53,700
Not until Zone 2.

3925
02:03:53,940 --> 02:03:55,980
Alright, drop.

3926
02:03:56,720 --> 02:03:57,040
Now.

3927
02:04:00,040 --> 02:04:01,140
Alright, nice.

3928
02:04:03,020 --> 02:04:07,700
Doki, I'm holding your virtual flesh-tuber hand.

3929
02:04:08,020 --> 02:04:09,220
Alright, here we go.

3930
02:04:09,260 --> 02:04:10,700
Hoping that we don't die immediately.

3931
02:04:11,880 --> 02:04:13,800
Virtual flesh-tuber hand?

3932
02:04:13,940 --> 02:04:15,100
That does not make sense.

3933
02:04:18,920 --> 02:04:20,000
Oh, no!

3934
02:04:20,300 --> 02:04:24,120
I didn't think... Some of my chat said it's a Smurf brand condoms.

3935
02:04:24,240 --> 02:04:24,480
No!

3936
02:04:24,680 --> 02:04:26,340
Why would you say that?

3937
02:04:26,860 --> 02:04:29,980
That makes me so much worse.

3938
02:04:30,500 --> 02:04:30,760
No!

3939
02:04:31,440 --> 02:04:34,700
Oh, they don't have the thing where you can, like, look above you.

3940
02:04:34,800 --> 02:04:35,420
Or something.

3941
02:04:35,860 --> 02:04:37,520
Yeah, you can't, like, free look or whatever.

3942
02:04:37,660 --> 02:04:38,320
Yeah, free look.

3943
02:04:38,640 --> 02:04:39,760
We don't have free look here.

3944
02:04:41,140 --> 02:04:42,160
Alright, we in this.

3945
02:04:43,280 --> 02:04:43,920
We're sharing.

3946
02:04:44,080 --> 02:04:45,420
There's also no rifles, right?

3947
02:04:45,640 --> 02:04:46,460
Yeah, no rifles.

3948
02:04:48,520 --> 02:04:49,220
We're sharing.

3949
02:04:49,800 --> 02:04:51,220
Sharing is caring, guys.

3950
02:04:51,540 --> 02:04:52,180
Sharing is caring.

3951
02:04:54,160 --> 02:04:54,560
Woo!

3952
02:04:55,960 --> 02:04:56,840
Oh, what'd I get?

3953
02:04:59,440 --> 02:05:01,100
Wait, so that means that, like...

3954
02:05:01,100 --> 02:05:03,360
Okay, so just SMGs and shotguns and stuff?

3955
02:05:05,040 --> 02:05:06,020
Oh, wait, I just forgot.

3956
02:05:06,140 --> 02:05:06,540
Yeah, yeah.

3957
02:05:06,560 --> 02:05:07,960
DMR and then, uh...

3958
02:05:08,720 --> 02:05:10,300
I guess I can use... Wait.

3959
02:05:10,460 --> 02:05:11,040
Is there a chest here?

3960
02:05:12,720 --> 02:05:13,540
Nah, there's no chest.

3961
02:05:15,960 --> 02:05:16,360
Woo!

3962
02:05:16,980 --> 02:05:18,900
I'm getting so many repair tools.

3963
02:05:19,540 --> 02:05:20,880
Oh, that's not what we needed.

3964
02:05:21,220 --> 02:05:21,940
I know, right?

3965
02:05:23,960 --> 02:05:24,700
Wait, are they shooting?

3966
02:05:24,900 --> 02:05:26,200
No, I actually shot my gun.

3967
02:05:26,360 --> 02:05:26,800
That was...

3968
02:05:26,800 --> 02:05:27,380
Oh, okay, okay.

3969
02:05:28,420 --> 02:05:29,280
Oh, Nuka-Cola.

3970
02:05:29,860 --> 02:05:30,680
Nuka-Cola.

3971
02:05:30,820 --> 02:05:31,620
Nuka-Cola.

3972
02:05:31,620 --> 02:05:32,140
Oh, do you need a big?

3973
02:05:33,800 --> 02:05:34,200
Uh...

3974
02:05:34,200 --> 02:05:34,920
No.

3975
02:05:35,560 --> 02:05:36,180
Okay, okay.

3976
02:05:36,220 --> 02:05:37,840
I can drink this Nuka-Cola now.

3977
02:05:38,080 --> 02:05:38,620
Should I drink it?

3978
02:05:38,700 --> 02:05:39,180
Is it worth it?

3979
02:05:39,460 --> 02:05:40,400
Yeah, you can drink it now.

3980
02:05:43,160 --> 02:05:43,580
Nuka-Cola.

3981
02:05:43,580 --> 02:05:45,180
Oh, I got shocky walkies!

3982
02:05:45,200 --> 02:05:45,640
Let's go!

3983
02:05:48,480 --> 02:05:50,840
Alright, so there's just gonna be peace until Zone 2.

3984
02:05:50,980 --> 02:05:51,580
It's so weird.

3985
02:05:51,780 --> 02:05:51,800
Yeah, Zone 2.

3986
02:05:52,700 --> 02:05:53,840
It's gonna be peaceful.

3987
02:05:53,960 --> 02:05:54,860
We come in peace.

3988
02:05:56,460 --> 02:05:56,860
Literally.

3989
02:05:57,680 --> 02:06:00,240
Oh, we can't... We can use the laser rifle, right?

3990
02:06:00,960 --> 02:06:01,240
Yeah!

3991
02:06:01,240 --> 02:06:01,980
Wait, uh...

3992
02:06:01,980 --> 02:06:02,300
Let me see.

3993
02:06:02,360 --> 02:06:03,940
I have the other... Oh, no, you can't.

3994
02:06:03,940 --> 02:06:04,280
You can't.

3995
02:06:04,760 --> 02:06:05,200
Oh, yeah.

3996
02:06:05,440 --> 02:06:05,860
Yeah, no.

3997
02:06:07,480 --> 02:06:07,760
Uh...

3998
02:06:07,760 --> 02:06:08,900
Oh, there's a sniper rifle.

3999
02:06:09,080 --> 02:06:10,120
Oh, there's a... There's a nitro!

4000
02:06:10,200 --> 02:06:10,440
Nitro!

4001
02:06:10,480 --> 02:06:10,740
Come here!

4002
02:06:10,800 --> 02:06:10,960
Come here!

4003
02:06:11,360 --> 02:06:12,000
Oh, you got a nitro?

4004
02:06:12,280 --> 02:06:13,200
Oh, you should get it.

4005
02:06:13,200 --> 02:06:13,640
You should get it.

4006
02:06:13,640 --> 02:06:14,260
Wait, you don't want that?

4007
02:06:14,380 --> 02:06:14,760
No, no, no.

4008
02:06:14,760 --> 02:06:15,260
You should get it.

4009
02:06:15,260 --> 02:06:16,300
I believe in you with it.

4010
02:06:16,660 --> 02:06:20,340
No, after what I did with the nitro... with the nitro fist, you should have it.

4011
02:06:22,260 --> 02:06:23,800
What are you... You want shockwaves then?

4012
02:06:25,620 --> 02:06:26,540
Did you say you have movement?

4013
02:06:27,100 --> 02:06:27,660
Uh, sure.

4014
02:06:27,720 --> 02:06:28,220
I'll take it.

4015
02:06:28,760 --> 02:06:29,040
Okay.

4016
02:06:29,120 --> 02:06:29,360
Okay.

4017
02:06:36,240 --> 02:06:37,180
Is there a chest here?

4018
02:06:39,420 --> 02:06:40,020
Holy shit.

4019
02:06:40,280 --> 02:06:41,140
Uh, how are you on ammo right now?

4020
02:06:41,160 --> 02:06:41,560
Are you pretty good?

4021
02:06:41,680 --> 02:06:42,260
I'm pretty... Oh.

4022
02:06:42,340 --> 02:06:43,300
I think so.

4023
02:06:44,620 --> 02:06:46,480
I wonder where these guys are gonna be.

4024
02:06:46,780 --> 02:06:47,540
I'll grab this.

4025
02:06:47,640 --> 02:06:48,040
Oh, more shockwaves?

4026
02:06:48,560 --> 02:06:49,220
Oh, that's good.

4027
02:06:51,500 --> 02:06:52,200
I'll take it.

4028
02:06:53,780 --> 02:06:55,000
I'll grab some ammo here.

4029
02:07:00,020 --> 02:07:00,980
What is this?

4030
02:07:01,440 --> 02:07:03,440
Oh, I'm gonna grab... Man, I'm getting the same SMG.

4031
02:07:03,600 --> 02:07:04,720
Wait, somebody died.

4032
02:07:05,660 --> 02:07:06,200
Wait, what?

4033
02:07:06,480 --> 02:07:07,840
Uh... Somebody got rebooted.

4034
02:07:09,020 --> 02:07:10,700
Did they accidentally kill...

4035
02:07:10,700 --> 02:07:11,840
I think they accidentally killed them.

4036
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:12,280
Yeah, yeah.

4037
02:07:12,320 --> 02:07:12,720
Maybe.

4038
02:07:13,800 --> 02:07:15,520
Uh, do you want the bubbles at all?

4039
02:07:15,940 --> 02:07:17,540
Uh, I can carry the bubbles.

4040
02:07:17,620 --> 02:07:17,880
Yeah.

4041
02:07:18,160 --> 02:07:18,600
Okay.

4042
02:07:18,660 --> 02:07:19,980
I have, uh... I have the houses.

4043
02:07:21,260 --> 02:07:21,700
Uh...

4044
02:07:21,700 --> 02:07:22,620
Yeah, I have houses too.

4045
02:07:22,680 --> 02:07:24,300
You can do some of my houses here.

4046
02:07:24,720 --> 02:07:25,320
Oh, sure.

4047
02:07:25,420 --> 02:07:25,820
Yeah, yeah.

4048
02:07:25,880 --> 02:07:26,280
I'm down.

4049
02:07:27,600 --> 02:07:29,560
Dang, there's really no, uh...

4050
02:07:30,500 --> 02:07:31,560
There's no pirate ships.

4051
02:07:32,340 --> 02:07:34,120
Yeah, maybe they took the pirate ships.

4052
02:07:35,980 --> 02:07:36,420
Um...

4053
02:07:36,420 --> 02:07:37,980
Well, I mean, we could wait here.

4054
02:07:38,040 --> 02:07:40,240
Or we could just move towards, like, a better spot in the zone.

4055
02:07:40,460 --> 02:07:40,460
Maybe.

4056
02:07:40,460 --> 02:07:42,600
I feel like we should be in zone before it's zone 2.

4057
02:07:42,740 --> 02:07:44,440
Yeah, let's... Let's go prioritize getting in zone.

4058
02:07:44,600 --> 02:07:44,800
Yeah.

4059
02:07:45,440 --> 02:07:45,800
What?

4060
02:07:46,540 --> 02:07:49,380
Okay, we have, like, a minute before zone 2, I guess.

4061
02:07:50,220 --> 02:07:52,420
Let's, uh... go this way, then?

4062
02:07:52,800 --> 02:07:53,700
We have the medkit.

4063
02:07:53,740 --> 02:07:56,060
Just remember to touch the water before we, like, leave this area.

4064
02:07:56,320 --> 02:07:56,420
Yeah.

4065
02:07:59,960 --> 02:08:00,780
Are we good?

4066
02:08:01,100 --> 02:08:01,300
Yeah.

4067
02:08:06,240 --> 02:08:08,340
Oh, I wish they'd bring back the Dragon Ball Z items.

4068
02:08:08,340 --> 02:08:10,460
The fucking cloud was so strong.

4069
02:08:10,900 --> 02:08:12,400
I think it's gonna come back again.

4070
02:08:12,560 --> 02:08:15,940
I'm pretty sure, like, I saw, like, a post about, like, it coming back.

4071
02:08:16,200 --> 02:08:17,260
Oh, that'll be fun.

4072
02:08:18,460 --> 02:08:19,200
Um... What do you think?

4073
02:08:19,240 --> 02:08:19,660
Zone's ending.

4074
02:08:20,900 --> 02:08:24,020
I am the worst at calling zones in this game.

4075
02:08:24,460 --> 02:08:28,020
I mean, like, I have a feeling of it going probably...

4076
02:08:28,480 --> 02:08:29,000
Actually, no.

4077
02:08:29,000 --> 02:08:29,720
I can't tell in zone 1.

4078
02:08:30,100 --> 02:08:34,820
Like, once it starts shrinking down, you can start, like, Yeah, but then in zone 2, that's when they start shooting.

4079
02:08:35,560 --> 02:08:35,920
Yeah.

4080
02:08:35,940 --> 02:08:38,320
I think what we can do for now... In 26 hours...

4081
02:08:38,340 --> 02:08:41,000
We should have a place before they start shooting.

4082
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:41,460
Oh, there's a team in there.

4083
02:08:41,820 --> 02:08:43,340
Yeah, they might chase after us.

4084
02:08:43,360 --> 02:08:44,000
Let's back up.

4085
02:08:44,140 --> 02:08:44,380
Let's back up.

4086
02:08:44,420 --> 02:08:44,840
Let's go over here.

4087
02:08:46,380 --> 02:08:48,180
Okay, cause I feel like their moment...

4088
02:08:48,180 --> 02:08:49,120
Yeah, we have 15 seconds.

4089
02:08:49,200 --> 02:08:50,100
That team's gonna chase us.

4090
02:08:52,620 --> 02:08:53,860
Oh, I'm so far.

4091
02:08:54,560 --> 02:08:55,740
You can burn a shockwave.

4092
02:08:55,820 --> 02:08:56,640
Burn one shockwave.

4093
02:08:57,260 --> 02:08:57,620
Okay.

4094
02:08:57,900 --> 02:09:00,220
I need to run up before I can burn it.

4095
02:09:01,140 --> 02:09:04,240
I'm gonna make sure that this PLY's clear before...

4096
02:09:04,860 --> 02:09:05,940
Cause I can look down for you.

4097
02:09:06,980 --> 02:09:07,660
Is it clear?

4098
02:09:09,080 --> 02:09:09,440
Uh...

4099
02:09:10,080 --> 02:09:12,440
Oh my god, people started fucking fighting.

4100
02:09:14,940 --> 02:09:15,480
Is it?

4101
02:09:16,380 --> 02:09:18,780
I don't hear anyone, but...

4102
02:09:19,780 --> 02:09:20,620
I'm trying to like...

4103
02:09:20,620 --> 02:09:20,980
Team behind you!

4104
02:09:20,980 --> 02:09:21,720
Team behind you!

4105
02:09:21,760 --> 02:09:22,360
Team behind you!

4106
02:09:22,620 --> 02:09:23,580
Team literally behind you!

4107
02:09:23,760 --> 02:09:24,740
Oh yeah, I see him.

4108
02:09:25,820 --> 02:09:27,280
Okay, I'm gonna drop down.

4109
02:09:28,840 --> 02:09:29,540
I'm gonna go.

4110
02:09:29,640 --> 02:09:30,300
I'm going your way.

4111
02:09:30,360 --> 02:09:30,720
I'm going your way.

4112
02:09:33,520 --> 02:09:34,740
Okay, go that way.

4113
02:09:34,780 --> 02:09:35,080
Go that way.

4114
02:09:35,100 --> 02:09:35,420
Go that way.

4115
02:09:36,140 --> 02:09:39,320
Literally saw them running at you when the moment zone closed.

4116
02:09:39,920 --> 02:09:41,700
I wonder if they like saw me beforehand.

4117
02:09:42,520 --> 02:09:43,140
I don't know.

4118
02:09:43,140 --> 02:09:43,540
That's scary.

4119
02:09:44,540 --> 02:09:45,240
Where should we go?

4120
02:09:45,280 --> 02:09:46,340
Oh yeah, I see him on the mountain.

4121
02:09:47,960 --> 02:09:49,100
Where should we go now?

4122
02:09:50,440 --> 02:09:52,160
Oh, I have no sight on this guy.

4123
02:09:52,420 --> 02:09:55,460
Uh, I mean we can like...

4124
02:09:56,320 --> 02:09:57,340
go back here?

4125
02:09:58,420 --> 02:09:59,600
Yeah, I mean it's still in zone.

4126
02:09:59,620 --> 02:10:01,020
Wait, they dropped a crown here.

4127
02:10:02,360 --> 02:10:03,960
Yeah, a lot of people dropped crowns.

4128
02:10:05,900 --> 02:10:06,300
Uh...

4129
02:10:07,300 --> 02:10:10,000
There was fighting to our south?

4130
02:10:11,380 --> 02:10:12,620
So, oh, team here.

4131
02:10:14,760 --> 02:10:15,460
I see them.

4132
02:10:16,100 --> 02:10:16,700
Wait, it's them!

4133
02:10:16,860 --> 02:10:17,180
125!

4134
02:10:17,660 --> 02:10:17,920
125.

4135
02:10:17,940 --> 02:10:18,260
Oh, you cracked them?

4136
02:10:18,480 --> 02:10:19,380
Yeah, I cracked one.

4137
02:10:19,460 --> 02:10:20,860
I did 125 on one of them too.

4138
02:10:22,260 --> 02:10:23,040
They're inside here?

4139
02:10:23,800 --> 02:10:24,360
That's them.

4140
02:10:24,440 --> 02:10:25,100
That's literally them.

4141
02:10:26,020 --> 02:10:27,320
Oh, one going on height.

4142
02:10:30,220 --> 02:10:30,700
I'm above.

4143
02:10:30,760 --> 02:10:31,080
I don't see them.

4144
02:10:32,480 --> 02:10:33,560
Oh, I'm not with you.

4145
02:10:33,640 --> 02:10:33,840
Cracked?

4146
02:10:34,380 --> 02:10:34,860
You're good.

4147
02:10:34,940 --> 02:10:35,840
I almost knocked one.

4148
02:10:38,180 --> 02:10:40,080
They're really, really I didn't even get cracked yet.

4149
02:10:41,300 --> 02:10:41,960
They're down here?

4150
02:10:42,380 --> 02:10:43,340
They regrouped?

4151
02:10:49,160 --> 02:10:50,640
They're... I think they're just healing.

4152
02:10:50,740 --> 02:10:51,440
They're healing right now.

4153
02:10:51,560 --> 02:10:52,220
You have to, yeah.

4154
02:10:53,720 --> 02:10:55,880
I'm like looking behind in this just in case.

4155
02:10:56,220 --> 02:10:58,420
Do you wanna like rotate to zone now?

4156
02:10:58,560 --> 02:10:59,780
Or do you wanna just commit to this fight?

4157
02:11:00,320 --> 02:11:01,140
I don't mind either.

4158
02:11:01,260 --> 02:11:02,580
What do you think is the best idea?

4159
02:11:03,860 --> 02:11:04,740
Start going this way.

4160
02:11:04,820 --> 02:11:05,400
Start going this way.

4161
02:11:05,580 --> 02:11:06,220
I'm looping.

4162
02:11:06,980 --> 02:11:07,240
Okay.

4163
02:11:09,840 --> 02:11:10,980
Okay, I'm gonna go.

4164
02:11:14,160 --> 02:11:16,720
Yeah, now they don't have...

4165
02:11:16,720 --> 02:11:18,740
They don't have heals now.

4166
02:11:20,120 --> 02:11:22,660
I think we should be okay.

4167
02:11:23,320 --> 02:11:24,360
I think.

4168
02:11:24,680 --> 02:11:25,760
Is this a sniper rifle?

4169
02:11:26,100 --> 02:11:27,840
No, I can't grab that either.

4170
02:11:31,780 --> 02:11:32,340
Oh!

4171
02:11:32,340 --> 02:11:33,080
Over across?

4172
02:11:33,460 --> 02:11:34,040
Oh, shit.

4173
02:11:34,500 --> 02:11:35,180
Go back.

4174
02:11:35,300 --> 02:11:35,580
Go back.

4175
02:11:35,660 --> 02:11:35,980
Go back.

4176
02:11:36,180 --> 02:11:37,820
Oh, I don't think I can.

4177
02:11:38,520 --> 02:11:39,500
Oh, I couldn't.

4178
02:11:39,500 --> 02:11:39,700
Yeah.

4179
02:11:40,140 --> 02:11:40,640
You're good.

4180
02:11:40,680 --> 02:11:40,900
You're good.

4181
02:11:40,920 --> 02:11:41,620
I'm gonna leave.

4182
02:11:41,660 --> 02:11:41,920
I'm gonna leave.

4183
02:11:43,340 --> 02:11:44,820
I'm gonna get chased so hard.

4184
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:45,480
Yeah, you are.

4185
02:11:46,820 --> 02:11:49,340
Oh, there is a whole lot of other team here.

4186
02:11:51,240 --> 02:11:52,440
I'm looking for you.

4187
02:11:53,640 --> 02:11:54,360
They're right here.

4188
02:11:54,400 --> 02:11:55,140
They have fists too.

4189
02:11:55,200 --> 02:11:55,620
They have fists.

4190
02:11:56,180 --> 02:11:58,840
Yeah, I just have a whole other team on me here.

4191
02:12:04,210 --> 02:12:05,190
Oh, my God.

4192
02:12:06,410 --> 02:12:06,770
Oh.

4193
02:12:07,090 --> 02:12:08,570
Do they have the magneto gloves?

4194
02:12:08,670 --> 02:12:09,190
I'm so jelly.

4195
02:12:09,270 --> 02:12:09,710
I don't know.

4196
02:12:10,950 --> 02:12:12,150
Are they still chasing you?

4197
02:12:12,370 --> 02:12:14,050
Oh, you're so lucky, man.

4198
02:12:14,050 --> 02:12:14,670
Oh, no.

4199
02:12:20,580 --> 02:12:21,440
That's so unlucky.

4200
02:12:21,600 --> 02:12:22,960
We ran into a different team.

4201
02:12:25,240 --> 02:12:27,400
We ran into another team.

4202
02:12:29,760 --> 02:12:30,860
That's so unlucky.

4203
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:33,540
I should just chill in the bunk.

4204
02:12:33,680 --> 02:12:34,540
I just need to heal.

4205
02:12:34,800 --> 02:12:35,840
I just need to keep on healing.

4206
02:12:36,960 --> 02:12:37,400
Yeah.

4207
02:12:37,460 --> 02:12:38,440
Not last though.

4208
02:12:39,280 --> 02:12:39,540
Yeah.

4209
02:12:39,680 --> 02:12:40,880
Definitely not last.

4210
02:12:41,860 --> 02:12:42,560
We were just unlucky.

4211
02:12:43,380 --> 02:12:45,180
We bumped into another team.

4212
02:12:46,620 --> 02:12:48,100
I guess we probably should just commit.

4213
02:12:48,160 --> 02:12:50,060
There's other people pulling up though for the fight.

4214
02:12:50,320 --> 02:12:50,760
Yeah.

4215
02:12:50,800 --> 02:12:54,400
I think we should have like... because like is the next game also safe zone?

4216
02:12:56,320 --> 02:12:57,200
It is.

4217
02:12:57,740 --> 02:12:58,320
Let's see.

4218
02:13:01,020 --> 02:13:03,360
Safe zone... off.

4219
02:13:03,420 --> 02:13:03,620
No.

4220
02:13:03,720 --> 02:13:04,460
There's no safe zone.

4221
02:13:04,720 --> 02:13:05,160
Okay.

4222
02:13:05,180 --> 02:13:07,220
I'm gonna read the next one.

4223
02:13:07,560 --> 02:13:10,060
Because I feel like if next...

4224
02:13:10,060 --> 02:13:10,240
Okay.

4225
02:13:10,280 --> 02:13:11,580
The last game is safe zone.

4226
02:13:11,620 --> 02:13:11,840
Oh, no.

4227
02:13:11,860 --> 02:13:13,720
Game 5, we have to land on the hot zone.

4228
02:13:14,340 --> 02:13:15,520
Oh, that's what we have to do.

4229
02:13:15,860 --> 02:13:16,180
Yeah.

4230
02:13:16,180 --> 02:13:16,180
Yeah.

4231
02:13:16,260 --> 02:13:16,580
Yeah.

4232
02:13:16,600 --> 02:13:16,920
Yeah.

4233
02:13:17,300 --> 02:13:19,080
So we just land on hot zone and leave again.

4234
02:13:19,400 --> 02:13:26,520
But I think like for safe zone, I think we should like land, loot, and then get to like a house to live in.

4235
02:13:27,900 --> 02:13:28,680
Or like... Yeah.

4236
02:13:28,780 --> 02:13:30,320
I think what we need to do is we need to grab a car.

4237
02:13:32,800 --> 02:13:33,600
Oh, that's right.

4238
02:13:33,680 --> 02:13:34,900
I forgot.

4239
02:13:35,260 --> 02:13:35,580
Yeah.

4240
02:13:37,860 --> 02:13:39,120
You guys should definitely fight.

4241
02:13:39,180 --> 02:13:39,800
I mean, we did.

4242
02:13:39,800 --> 02:13:41,040
I was owning them.

4243
02:13:41,660 --> 02:13:43,040
I literally cracked both.

4244
02:13:43,100 --> 02:13:43,940
I almost knocked one.

4245
02:13:44,240 --> 02:13:44,260
Yeah.

4246
02:13:44,280 --> 02:13:44,860
We did.

4247
02:13:45,020 --> 02:13:45,820
I did 125.

4248
02:13:50,910 --> 02:13:52,990
I think maybe we should have committed that then.

4249
02:13:54,130 --> 02:13:55,550
I could have, but like...

4250
02:13:55,550 --> 02:13:58,170
You probably would have had to be like directly on me.

4251
02:13:58,230 --> 02:14:00,610
Because like if I had pushed them, I would have gotten double teamed.

4252
02:14:00,890 --> 02:14:01,170
Yeah.

4253
02:14:01,190 --> 02:14:05,010
Because like I did 144 to one of them.

4254
02:14:05,050 --> 02:14:06,690
And then I did, I think like...

4255
02:14:06,690 --> 02:14:07,290
Yeah.

4256
02:14:07,310 --> 02:14:08,670
I did 125 on the other.

4257
02:14:08,970 --> 02:14:10,550
Oh, that means they're both one-shot.

4258
02:14:10,630 --> 02:14:10,950
Yeah.

4259
02:14:10,950 --> 02:14:12,750
Well, one was one-shot at first.

4260
02:14:12,970 --> 02:14:15,010
And then the other one was getting an advantage point.

4261
02:14:15,130 --> 02:14:15,510
Or whatever.

4262
02:14:17,010 --> 02:14:17,410
So...

4263
02:14:17,410 --> 02:14:17,770
Yeah.

4264
02:14:18,290 --> 02:14:19,810
We definitely could have jumped on them.

4265
02:14:20,230 --> 02:14:20,630
Definitely.

4266
02:14:22,230 --> 02:14:22,790
It's okay.

4267
02:14:23,350 --> 02:14:23,950
It's okay.

4268
02:14:27,310 --> 02:14:29,890
I mean, we can play our own match again if we want.

4269
02:14:30,350 --> 02:14:31,070
Oh, yeah, yeah.

4270
02:14:31,170 --> 02:14:31,470
I'll be right back.

4271
02:14:31,490 --> 02:14:32,070
I'm gonna use the bathroom.

4272
02:14:32,230 --> 02:14:32,690
I'll be right back.

4273
02:14:32,830 --> 02:14:33,050
Okay.

4274
02:14:33,430 --> 02:14:33,830
Alrighty.

4275
02:16:02,940 --> 02:16:03,540
I'm back.

4276
02:16:05,460 --> 02:16:06,140
Welcome back.

4277
02:16:06,940 --> 02:16:08,500
I'm sorry I accidentally muted.

4278
02:16:08,600 --> 02:16:09,520
Welcome back!

4279
02:16:09,980 --> 02:16:10,460
Yay!

4280
02:16:11,620 --> 02:16:13,740
So what's the strat for next game?

4281
02:16:14,900 --> 02:16:18,660
So the strat for next game is...

4282
02:16:18,660 --> 02:16:27,420
We can land pretty much at the corner of the front of the ship.

4283
02:16:27,940 --> 02:16:28,500
Okay.

4284
02:16:28,840 --> 02:16:34,200
Because there is a ring that we can take that will give us nitro.

4285
02:16:34,220 --> 02:16:35,340
And it will launch us as well.

4286
02:16:35,560 --> 02:16:36,080
Oh, okay.

4287
02:16:36,340 --> 02:16:38,580
I feel like one of the other teams would want to do that too.

4288
02:16:39,040 --> 02:16:40,380
I feel like they would.

4289
02:16:41,660 --> 02:16:48,400
Because the hard part is like if we land safely on the corners that's also a viable strat too.

4290
02:16:48,600 --> 02:16:53,800
But like if we don't get any movement and someone else does, we're basically just dead.

4291
02:16:54,040 --> 02:16:54,220
Yeah.

4292
02:16:55,060 --> 02:16:55,500
So...

4293
02:16:55,500 --> 02:17:03,380
It could be like kind of chaotic if we just land at the ring and then we just keep on running for wherever the nearest safe zone is.

4294
02:17:03,520 --> 02:17:03,920
Oh, okay.

4295
02:17:04,080 --> 02:17:06,440
Also I'm ready to play some pubs while we wait.

4296
02:17:06,520 --> 02:17:07,360
This is going to take a while.

4297
02:17:07,780 --> 02:17:08,600
Alright, here.

4298
02:17:08,660 --> 02:17:09,300
Lay back out.

4299
02:17:10,500 --> 02:17:11,880
I feel like this is longer.

4300
02:17:12,120 --> 02:17:13,720
They made it so much longer.

4301
02:17:15,020 --> 02:17:20,280
Yeah, it's also because in Reload Reloaded is like way faster too.

4302
02:17:20,460 --> 02:17:21,580
Yeah, this is such a...

4303
02:17:21,580 --> 02:17:25,180
I thought Day 2 was five games instead of six.

4304
02:17:25,880 --> 02:17:26,800
That's what I thought too.

4305
02:17:26,920 --> 02:17:27,100
Yeah.

4306
02:17:27,220 --> 02:17:30,160
They added an extra... Why did they add an extra game?

4307
02:17:30,620 --> 02:17:31,260
Why did...

4308
02:17:31,860 --> 02:17:36,300
I'm pretty sure all the FNCS players are like we just wanted to make more money in the other place.

4309
02:17:36,340 --> 02:17:38,180
But it's the same money.

4310
02:17:38,460 --> 02:17:39,860
Why did they add an extra game?

4311
02:17:40,620 --> 02:17:41,500
Yeah, what?

4312
02:17:41,680 --> 02:17:43,740
I thought it was five games.

4313
02:17:43,960 --> 02:17:45,740
When did it became six games?

4314
02:17:45,860 --> 02:17:48,580
Our souls are binded even longer.

4315
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:52,220
When did they add an extra game?

4316
02:17:55,100 --> 02:17:57,600
We have to suffer for one more.

4317
02:17:58,220 --> 02:17:59,620
No, two more.

4318
02:17:59,920 --> 02:18:02,140
There's still two more games left.

4319
02:18:06,140 --> 02:18:07,420
We're doing it for the vibes.

4320
02:18:07,800 --> 02:18:08,600
Yeah, yeah.

4321
02:18:08,600 --> 02:18:08,880
Exactly.

4322
02:18:08,920 --> 02:18:09,860
That's our priority.

4323
02:18:10,200 --> 02:18:10,640
Exactly.

4324
02:18:13,800 --> 02:18:14,700
You know what's wild?

4325
02:18:15,020 --> 02:18:15,300
What?

4326
02:18:16,060 --> 02:18:18,580
Jay's team, we like own them pretty hard.

4327
02:18:18,780 --> 02:18:19,120
Yeah.

4328
02:18:19,240 --> 02:18:20,080
We just got third.

4329
02:18:20,260 --> 02:18:23,480
Like we got caught by a different team.

4330
02:18:24,200 --> 02:18:29,100
I think what they were going to wait for is for us to push them on the inside.

4331
02:18:29,200 --> 02:18:32,160
Like they're probably going to hold inside and start holding corners or whatever.

4332
02:18:32,840 --> 02:18:33,280
Yeah.

4333
02:18:33,340 --> 02:18:38,080
But like a valid play that you can do with shockwaves is you can break walls.

4334
02:18:38,420 --> 02:18:39,440
You can break through walls or whatever.

4335
02:18:39,680 --> 02:18:40,640
Yeah, I had shockwaves.

4336
02:18:40,840 --> 02:18:41,540
We could have done that.

4337
02:18:41,900 --> 02:18:42,240
Yeah.

4338
02:18:43,400 --> 02:18:44,500
You're literally going to be a pro.

4339
02:18:44,980 --> 02:18:45,780
Watch, I'm calling it.

4340
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:46,900
No, this is the last game.

4341
02:18:46,900 --> 02:18:47,980
A doggy skin is going to happen.

4342
02:18:48,740 --> 02:18:49,080
What?

4343
02:18:49,180 --> 02:18:50,320
And then you're going to be a pro.

4344
02:18:51,760 --> 02:18:52,100
No.

4345
02:18:53,200 --> 02:18:53,900
Wait, what do you mean?

4346
02:18:55,820 --> 02:18:56,800
I'm snacking right now.

4347
02:18:56,840 --> 02:18:57,460
I didn't have lunch.

4348
02:18:58,160 --> 02:18:58,500
What?

4349
02:18:58,640 --> 02:18:59,480
You didn't have lunch?

4350
02:18:59,620 --> 02:19:00,660
I didn't have lunch.

4351
02:19:00,980 --> 02:19:02,480
I went straight to this tournament.

4352
02:19:04,020 --> 02:19:06,640
I happily eat some popcorn.

4353
02:19:06,840 --> 02:19:07,520
I love popcorn.

4354
02:19:08,020 --> 02:19:08,860
Popcorn is my craft.

4355
02:19:13,140 --> 02:19:13,580
Goku!

4356
02:19:14,800 --> 02:19:15,240
Hello.

4357
02:19:15,240 --> 02:19:15,680
Vegeta!

4358
02:19:19,580 --> 02:19:21,540
Oh my god, this is why we didn't win.

4359
02:19:21,600 --> 02:19:22,540
We didn't power up.

4360
02:19:23,580 --> 02:19:24,460
I'm constipated.

4361
02:19:24,680 --> 02:19:26,000
And then Super Saiyan.

4362
02:19:27,100 --> 02:19:28,520
Look, we got blue hair now.

4363
02:19:30,120 --> 02:19:32,600
Oh, now I don't have a shirt.

4364
02:19:33,500 --> 02:19:35,200
You can't go beyond me.

4365
02:19:36,020 --> 02:19:36,580
That's right.

4366
02:19:36,620 --> 02:19:38,180
This is why you'll never be better than me.

4367
02:19:38,420 --> 02:19:38,640
Vegeta.

4368
02:19:38,780 --> 02:19:39,840
You can't go shirtless.

4369
02:19:40,140 --> 02:19:41,660
My forehead is bigger than yours.

4370
02:19:41,900 --> 02:19:45,060
You can never go shirtless and that's why you'll never be better than me.

4371
02:19:45,680 --> 02:19:46,480
What do you mean?

4372
02:19:46,560 --> 02:19:47,660
I can go shirtless.

4373
02:19:48,080 --> 02:19:50,040
Bulma can attest to it.

4374
02:19:51,540 --> 02:19:53,600
No, the Saiyan suit stays on.

4375
02:20:01,120 --> 02:20:02,320
Bulma's into that shit.

4376
02:20:04,720 --> 02:20:07,400
Bulma's like, I only take big strong Saiyans.

4377
02:20:08,680 --> 02:20:10,120
Do you want to go to Nitro Dome?

4378
02:20:12,040 --> 02:20:13,040
Let's go to Nitro Dome.

4379
02:20:14,020 --> 02:20:15,000
Oh wait, actually no.

4380
02:20:15,040 --> 02:20:15,680
We can practice this.

4381
02:20:16,140 --> 02:20:17,020
Oh yeah, yeah.

4382
02:20:17,740 --> 02:20:19,040
There's going to be so many dudes here.

4383
02:20:19,100 --> 02:20:20,780
We're probably going to insta-die right now because we're so late.

4384
02:20:21,420 --> 02:20:22,000
That's fine.

4385
02:20:22,360 --> 02:20:24,420
Okay, so do you see the red thing though?

4386
02:20:24,540 --> 02:20:24,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4387
02:20:25,340 --> 02:20:26,460
That's what we're going to land on.

4388
02:20:26,520 --> 02:20:27,480
We're going to land literally on that.

4389
02:20:28,280 --> 02:20:29,260
What am I eating guys?

4390
02:20:29,400 --> 02:20:30,720
I'm eating those little like...

4391
02:20:33,140 --> 02:20:34,280
The Meji chocolate.

4392
02:20:34,500 --> 02:20:35,520
The rainbow one.

4393
02:20:36,220 --> 02:20:36,840
With the Marble.

4394
02:20:37,500 --> 02:20:39,240
Oh, that sounds so good.

4395
02:20:40,500 --> 02:20:42,100
It's like a classic kid's chocolate.

4396
02:20:48,490 --> 02:20:49,030
Wait, what?

4397
02:20:49,190 --> 02:20:50,150
Did no one like go here?

4398
02:20:50,870 --> 02:20:51,590
I guess not.

4399
02:20:51,670 --> 02:20:52,250
I don't see anybody.

4400
02:20:53,390 --> 02:20:53,750
So...

4401
02:20:54,170 --> 02:20:55,190
What we'll do...

4402
02:20:55,810 --> 02:20:56,970
Oh no, there's people fighting here.

4403
02:20:57,550 --> 02:21:00,750
So what we'll do is we'll just basically land here on the little ring.

4404
02:21:00,990 --> 02:21:02,430
Yeah, and then we peace out.

4405
02:21:02,770 --> 02:21:03,850
Yeah, we just hop out.

4406
02:21:04,430 --> 02:21:05,310
That's all we're going to do.

4407
02:21:05,390 --> 02:21:06,010
And then we just keep running.

4408
02:21:07,830 --> 02:21:09,190
Alright, I'm going to grab a gun.

4409
02:21:09,270 --> 02:21:10,070
Let's kill this.

4410
02:21:10,090 --> 02:21:10,630
Let's kill them right now.

4411
02:21:11,130 --> 02:21:11,990
Nuka-Cola.

4412
02:21:13,370 --> 02:21:14,190
Nuka-Cola.

4413
02:21:15,410 --> 02:21:17,130
Goku's got the nukes.

4414
02:21:17,190 --> 02:21:17,950
What the?

4415
02:21:19,870 --> 02:21:20,410
Goku's ready.

4416
02:21:21,830 --> 02:21:23,830
Oh, what the fuck, Richard?

4417
02:21:24,250 --> 02:21:25,630
What the fuck happened?

4418
02:21:25,630 --> 02:21:25,970
Oh, I'm dead.

4419
02:21:26,990 --> 02:21:29,030
I got shot by like two teams.

4420
02:21:32,370 --> 02:21:33,890
Haha, it's my car now.

4421
02:21:34,470 --> 02:21:35,030
Oh, did you?

4422
02:21:35,130 --> 02:21:36,750
Yeah, you can drive over my car.

4423
02:21:36,750 --> 02:21:37,850
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4424
02:21:38,570 --> 02:21:39,550
Wait, where's your car?

4425
02:21:40,230 --> 02:21:40,890
It's right there.

4426
02:21:42,290 --> 02:21:42,690
Oh.

4427
02:21:45,010 --> 02:21:45,790
Did I get it?

4428
02:21:46,110 --> 02:21:46,510
No.

4429
02:21:47,150 --> 02:21:47,550
Goddamn!

4430
02:21:47,750 --> 02:21:48,510
Okay, good.

4431
02:21:51,170 --> 02:21:52,470
Okay, round two.

4432
02:21:55,970 --> 02:21:56,970
Oh, you got that.

4433
02:21:56,990 --> 02:21:57,410
Did I get it?

4434
02:22:00,430 --> 02:22:01,230
Round three.

4435
02:22:01,610 --> 02:22:03,530
I know you said I could drive over the car.

4436
02:22:03,550 --> 02:22:04,730
I'm literally over it.

4437
02:22:04,730 --> 02:22:06,850
You have to go a little more to the right.

4438
02:22:06,930 --> 02:22:07,330
Yeah, yeah, right there.

4439
02:22:07,430 --> 02:22:08,570
There we go.

4440
02:22:08,730 --> 02:22:09,590
Goodbye, guys.

4441
02:22:10,090 --> 02:22:10,570
Goodbye.

4442
02:22:13,490 --> 02:22:14,410
Round three.

4443
02:22:15,130 --> 02:22:16,570
It's round three.

4444
02:22:19,290 --> 02:22:19,970
Oh, wait.

4445
02:22:20,010 --> 02:22:21,050
What the fuck?

4446
02:22:21,090 --> 02:22:22,630
How many cars are here?

4447
02:22:24,570 --> 02:22:25,350
Leave me alone.

4448
02:22:25,350 --> 02:22:26,310
Oh my god, you're so popular.

4449
02:22:27,690 --> 02:22:29,370
How do I nitro boost?

4450
02:22:29,790 --> 02:22:32,210
They want Goku's autograph.

4451
02:22:32,450 --> 02:22:32,990
Oh, you just shift.

4452
02:22:33,070 --> 02:22:33,430
You just shift.

4453
02:22:33,470 --> 02:22:33,890
Oh, just shift?

4454
02:22:34,090 --> 02:22:34,350
Okay.

4455
02:22:35,310 --> 02:22:36,230
That's fucking right.

4456
02:22:36,790 --> 02:22:38,670
I saved my nitro for this.

4457
02:22:39,610 --> 02:22:40,250
Oh, god.

4458
02:22:40,590 --> 02:22:41,690
Oh, they're all just...

4459
02:22:41,690 --> 02:22:43,370
Oh, no.

4460
02:22:43,910 --> 02:22:44,690
Not yet.

4461
02:22:45,110 --> 02:22:45,830
Oh, you're good.

4462
02:22:45,870 --> 02:22:46,530
Not yet.

4463
02:22:46,630 --> 02:22:48,290
I'll bring him to the other car.

4464
02:22:50,210 --> 02:22:51,050
Oh, run over the...

4465
02:22:51,050 --> 02:22:51,850
Oh, you missed it.

4466
02:22:52,030 --> 02:22:52,470
It's okay.

4467
02:22:52,650 --> 02:22:53,070
It's okay.

4468
02:22:53,070 --> 02:22:53,450
You're good.

4469
02:22:53,710 --> 02:22:53,990
You're good.

4470
02:22:54,070 --> 02:22:54,770
Get out of the car.

4471
02:22:54,810 --> 02:22:55,230
Get out of the car.

4472
02:22:55,370 --> 02:22:56,010
It's okay.

4473
02:23:00,090 --> 02:23:00,750
Oh, my.

4474
02:23:00,850 --> 02:23:01,230
Fuck you.

4475
02:23:03,090 --> 02:23:03,770
No, John Wick.

4476
02:23:03,770 --> 02:23:03,870
You're better.

4477
02:23:07,370 --> 02:23:08,890
Of course, it's John Wick.

4478
02:23:09,090 --> 02:23:12,410
Of course, John Wick would chase Goku.

4479
02:23:12,910 --> 02:23:14,130
Of course, John Wick would chase Goku.

4480
02:23:14,130 --> 02:23:15,730
You were only trying to snatch up Bulma.

4481
02:23:16,110 --> 02:23:16,710
You were only trying to snatch up Bulma.

4482
02:23:16,710 --> 02:23:17,570
Oh, my god.

4483
02:23:18,630 --> 02:23:19,890
You know, they're pretty bad.

4484
02:23:20,030 --> 02:23:20,570
Not gonna lie.

4485
02:23:21,870 --> 02:23:24,530
What if you were actually just better, though, Dokie?

4486
02:23:24,770 --> 02:23:24,950
What if you were actually just better, though, Dokie?

4487
02:23:24,950 --> 02:23:26,670
They were pretty... No, they were just bad.

4488
02:23:27,030 --> 02:23:28,990
You're just simply better.

4489
02:23:28,990 --> 02:23:31,930
I lived for so long for two of these people.

4490
02:23:32,270 --> 02:23:32,570
I lived for so long for two of these people.

4491
02:23:34,490 --> 02:23:35,050
Wait.

4492
02:23:35,150 --> 02:23:36,150
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

4493
02:23:36,290 --> 02:23:37,010
I'm gonna stay right here, though.

4494
02:23:37,190 --> 02:23:39,710
Alright, guys.

4495
02:23:40,990 --> 02:23:43,550
Why are Fortnite players so sweaty?

4496
02:23:49,850 --> 02:23:50,950
Why did they...

4497
02:23:50,950 --> 02:23:53,310
I can't believe they complained about the cars.

4498
02:23:53,870 --> 02:23:59,710
I can't believe it.

4499
02:23:59,710 --> 02:24:01,170
No fun.

4500
02:24:01,470 --> 02:24:02,790
They got rid of the cars.

4501
02:24:02,990 --> 02:24:03,850
No fun.

4502
02:24:04,230 --> 02:24:05,450
No fun allowed.

4503
02:24:07,430 --> 02:24:10,230
This game was built off of kids' monies.

4504
02:24:10,310 --> 02:24:10,810
Like...

4505
02:24:11,910 --> 02:24:12,510
Sorry.

4506
02:24:12,710 --> 02:24:13,490
Kids' money.

4507
02:24:13,730 --> 02:24:14,250
Literally.

4508
02:24:14,890 --> 02:24:17,370
This game was built off of children.

4509
02:24:18,590 --> 02:24:20,070
And I can't have fun?

4510
02:24:22,030 --> 02:24:23,890
Children funded this game.

4511
02:24:28,110 --> 02:24:28,750
You're right.

4512
02:24:28,950 --> 02:24:29,770
Parents' money.

4513
02:24:33,390 --> 02:24:34,670
How dare they.

4514
02:24:36,750 --> 02:24:37,230
Alright.

4515
02:24:37,430 --> 02:24:38,930
I guess we're landing back here.

4516
02:24:42,330 --> 02:24:42,810
No!

4517
02:24:43,050 --> 02:24:44,930
It can be fun to play!

4518
02:24:45,810 --> 02:24:46,890
It can be!

4519
02:24:47,250 --> 02:24:49,310
Did you not see what they did with the cars?

4520
02:24:49,510 --> 02:24:50,830
That shit looks so fun!

4521
02:24:52,270 --> 02:24:56,310
And then they took it out the moment I realized how fun it could be.

4522
02:24:56,550 --> 02:24:57,730
They took it out.

4523
02:24:58,010 --> 02:24:59,770
They didn't want me to have fun.

4524
02:25:06,640 --> 02:25:08,200
I can't believe it.

4525
02:25:08,280 --> 02:25:09,400
That's so messed up.

4526
02:25:10,320 --> 02:25:12,640
They took away the one thing I'd feel joy.

4527
02:25:14,220 --> 02:25:16,880
The one thing they knew I'd feel joy.

4528
02:25:19,260 --> 02:25:21,780
And they wouldn't even let me have the car.

4529
02:25:21,920 --> 02:25:23,340
That's the most fucked up part.

4530
02:25:24,060 --> 02:25:26,460
I was like, let me have the car at least.

4531
02:25:26,460 --> 02:25:28,080
Like, what am I gonna do with it?

4532
02:25:34,100 --> 02:25:35,800
What can I do with it?

4533
02:25:36,240 --> 02:25:37,160
I'm back!

4534
02:25:37,560 --> 02:25:38,340
I'm back!

4535
02:25:39,020 --> 02:25:39,800
Welcome back.

4536
02:25:40,020 --> 02:25:40,980
I killed a guy.

4537
02:25:41,500 --> 02:25:42,560
Oh, you killed a dude?

4538
02:25:42,780 --> 02:25:43,900
Yeah, fuck this guy.

4539
02:25:44,560 --> 02:25:46,740
That's my fucking teammate right there.

4540
02:25:46,740 --> 02:25:48,080
Fuck that one guy in particular.

4541
02:25:49,280 --> 02:25:52,440
I don't think he was ready to see me get a fucking shotgun.

4542
02:25:53,780 --> 02:25:56,000
I don't know if this is...

4543
02:25:56,000 --> 02:25:57,320
There's people fighting.

4544
02:25:57,540 --> 02:26:02,540
I see a dude that I'm landing close to.

4545
02:26:03,200 --> 02:26:03,840
That's me.

4546
02:26:04,440 --> 02:26:05,720
That is not me.

4547
02:26:07,740 --> 02:26:09,320
That was 100%.

4548
02:26:09,320 --> 02:26:10,440
Surely I'll get a gun, right?

4549
02:26:10,980 --> 02:26:11,460
Surely.

4550
02:26:11,460 --> 02:26:12,340
Oh, I got a gun.

4551
02:26:12,460 --> 02:26:13,460
I see people on my end.

4552
02:26:18,540 --> 02:26:19,640
Oh my god, it's Deadpool!

4553
02:26:20,360 --> 02:26:21,160
Yo, Deadpool?

4554
02:26:21,640 --> 02:26:25,720
Deadpool's here with his Wait, didn't the movie come out today?

4555
02:26:25,880 --> 02:26:26,600
I don't remember.

4556
02:26:26,980 --> 02:26:28,880
No, I just saw Deadpool come over here.

4557
02:26:31,800 --> 02:26:32,400
But...

4558
02:26:32,400 --> 02:26:33,900
I'm gonna slurp.

4559
02:26:35,080 --> 02:26:36,020
Yo, we good.

4560
02:26:38,500 --> 02:26:39,660
He's above me.

4561
02:26:40,720 --> 02:26:41,700
There's a car?

4562
02:26:41,980 --> 02:26:43,360
There's a guy above me.

4563
02:26:44,760 --> 02:26:45,900
Oh, I hear the car.

4564
02:26:47,380 --> 02:26:49,780
There's so many footsteps, I don't like it.

4565
02:26:50,400 --> 02:26:52,700
Oh my, what the?

4566
02:26:53,160 --> 02:26:54,380
Cowboy lady, what?

4567
02:26:56,420 --> 02:26:57,240
Wait, what?

4568
02:26:57,540 --> 02:26:58,100
Oh!

4569
02:26:58,880 --> 02:27:00,600
I got shot on my side.

4570
02:27:01,060 --> 02:27:02,440
I wish I had a shotgun.

4571
02:27:02,900 --> 02:27:04,620
Oh wait, no, that's not Deadpool.

4572
02:27:05,100 --> 02:27:06,160
That's just a lady.

4573
02:27:06,600 --> 02:27:10,780
That's just a woman.

4574
02:27:12,420 --> 02:27:14,100
No, she has Deadpool pants.

4575
02:27:15,020 --> 02:27:15,880
Oh, does she?

4576
02:27:16,080 --> 02:27:16,620
Does she?

4577
02:27:17,540 --> 02:27:18,420
I can't tell.

4578
02:27:19,920 --> 02:27:20,760
Movie's next week?

4579
02:27:20,880 --> 02:27:22,260
Oh, it's next week.

4580
02:27:22,260 --> 02:27:23,660
Oh, I thought it was this week.

4581
02:27:25,580 --> 02:27:26,500
I'm so dumb.

4582
02:27:28,060 --> 02:27:29,320
Oh, the game's about to end.

4583
02:27:29,480 --> 02:27:30,360
Oh, okay.

4584
02:27:30,460 --> 02:27:31,920
I'm watching Rivals right now.

4585
02:27:37,850 --> 02:27:39,830
Oh, somebody got killed early?

4586
02:27:41,230 --> 02:27:42,410
Ooh, there's drama!

4587
02:27:43,430 --> 02:27:43,950
Ayo?

4588
02:27:44,110 --> 02:27:46,770
Wait, oh, are you reading the Rivals show?

4589
02:27:47,250 --> 02:27:53,170
Apparently, the caster on stream said kills weren't allowed, and then, but the kills were allowed.

4590
02:27:53,430 --> 02:27:54,710
So people got confused.

4591
02:27:55,950 --> 02:27:56,470
Wait, what?

4592
02:27:56,470 --> 02:27:56,470
No!

4593
02:27:57,370 --> 02:28:03,550
Yeah, so people were like, wait, the knife got killed for no reason, and then later I'm like, sorry, caster made a mistake.

4594
02:28:04,110 --> 02:28:04,510
Dang.

4595
02:28:05,150 --> 02:28:07,130
You were allowed to be killed by then.

4596
02:28:07,750 --> 02:28:10,230
Wait, but like, how would they know from the caster?

4597
02:28:10,770 --> 02:28:14,910
Like, cause, does that mean that they're like, they just have the Twitch room on the other monitor?

4598
02:28:15,150 --> 02:28:18,650
Cause maybe like, maybe like somebody said, wait, they're not supposed to kill you.

4599
02:28:18,710 --> 02:28:20,210
Like, someone in the chat said that.

4600
02:28:20,930 --> 02:28:21,770
Oh, probably.

4601
02:28:21,770 --> 02:28:23,330
And was like, they're not supposed to kill you!

4602
02:28:31,260 --> 02:28:34,320
We get killed cause on Twitch Rivals they said they killed us early.

4603
02:28:34,400 --> 02:28:34,820
Yeah, yeah.

4604
02:28:35,080 --> 02:28:36,600
Somebody said they got killed off early.

4605
02:28:37,420 --> 02:28:38,600
But, they weren't.

4606
02:28:38,640 --> 02:28:40,500
But then it was like a caster mistake.

4607
02:28:41,320 --> 02:28:41,800
Ohhhh.

4608
02:28:43,100 --> 02:28:45,120
Just a caster mistake.

4609
02:28:46,580 --> 02:28:49,240
Oh, I should go back to the lobby.

4610
02:28:49,280 --> 02:28:50,460
Okay, only some died.

4611
02:28:50,600 --> 02:28:52,480
Maybe Goku and Vegeta is just cursed.

4612
02:28:52,720 --> 02:28:53,240
Like, maybe.

4613
02:28:54,580 --> 02:28:56,260
Vegeta do be having a big head.

4614
02:28:56,400 --> 02:28:57,360
I don't know about Goku.

4615
02:28:57,360 --> 02:28:58,760
Maybe, play your main.

4616
02:28:58,900 --> 02:28:59,760
What's your main skin?

4617
02:29:00,380 --> 02:29:00,840
My main?

4618
02:29:01,040 --> 02:29:01,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4619
02:29:02,020 --> 02:29:03,140
Maybe that's it.

4620
02:29:03,380 --> 02:29:05,040
It's cause you're not on your main skin.

4621
02:29:06,820 --> 02:29:07,700
I could...

4622
02:29:07,700 --> 02:29:09,580
Oh, I don't know which one we're on.

4623
02:29:09,680 --> 02:29:10,460
Wait, what's your main skin?

4624
02:29:11,760 --> 02:29:12,200
Anything.

4625
02:29:12,200 --> 02:29:14,020
I'm gonna match whatever skin you have.

4626
02:29:14,060 --> 02:29:15,780
What is this?

4627
02:29:16,040 --> 02:29:16,980
Is this FNCS?

4628
02:29:17,340 --> 02:29:18,480
Is that the Fortnite Cup?

4629
02:29:18,900 --> 02:29:21,800
Oh, that's the tournament that they have right after.

4630
02:29:22,380 --> 02:29:23,100
Oh, yeah, yeah.

4631
02:29:23,120 --> 02:29:23,740
FNCS, yeah.

4632
02:29:23,940 --> 02:29:24,920
That's what they're talking about.

4633
02:29:25,320 --> 02:29:27,800
Yeah, that's what the fucking nerds were talking about.

4634
02:29:30,120 --> 02:29:32,820
The shop refreshed for FNCS?

4635
02:29:33,640 --> 02:29:34,120
FNCS?

4636
02:29:34,160 --> 02:29:35,960
Who the fuck is gonna buy it?

4637
02:29:36,540 --> 02:29:38,060
I'm sorry, that's so toxic.

4638
02:29:40,680 --> 02:29:41,860
Tell him, Doki!

4639
02:29:42,040 --> 02:29:42,880
Let him have it!

4640
02:29:43,020 --> 02:29:45,080
Who's gonna buy these skins?

4641
02:29:47,300 --> 02:29:50,800
Sorry, that's really toxic.

4642
02:29:51,300 --> 02:29:54,700
All I'm saying is that it's not even...

4643
02:29:56,220 --> 02:29:59,700
I would totally gift you the shark skin if I could.

4644
02:30:00,100 --> 02:30:01,980
But I have to wait one more day.

4645
02:30:02,180 --> 02:30:10,660
They need like, okay, all I'm saying is that if they're gonna do an actual, like, Fortnite Cup skin, just make it a condom skin and then have the FNCS at the back.

4646
02:30:11,120 --> 02:30:12,100
Right, yeah.

4647
02:30:12,340 --> 02:30:13,280
That's what they all want.

4648
02:30:14,200 --> 02:30:16,020
They're not gonna put the skin on.

4649
02:30:16,100 --> 02:30:17,160
Everybody knows it.

4650
02:30:17,160 --> 02:30:18,020
Look at the hitbox.

4651
02:30:18,360 --> 02:30:19,580
Why is it a guy?

4652
02:30:19,860 --> 02:30:22,700
The guy model has big hitboxes.

4653
02:30:22,740 --> 02:30:23,820
It should have been a woman.

4654
02:30:24,540 --> 02:30:25,500
Are you talking about the dude?

4655
02:30:25,600 --> 02:30:26,700
The dude with the big ass jacket?

4656
02:30:26,700 --> 02:30:28,180
Yeah, the big ass jacket.

4657
02:30:28,520 --> 02:30:30,320
Competing players aren't gonna put the skin on.

4658
02:30:30,600 --> 02:30:33,600
It should be literally the condom skin in these colors.

4659
02:30:33,860 --> 02:30:38,460
And it should have boobs because apparently the women version has, like, the smallest hitbox.

4660
02:30:42,100 --> 02:30:43,780
I can tell them.

4661
02:30:44,160 --> 02:30:44,940
Tell them.

4662
02:30:45,640 --> 02:30:46,900
Oh my god.

4663
02:30:48,360 --> 02:30:49,520
That's all I'm saying.

4664
02:30:50,760 --> 02:30:54,240
They should just have the FNCS at the back with the condom skin.

4665
02:30:55,020 --> 02:30:58,040
Is anyone gonna get this, like, FNCS hoodie guy?

4666
02:30:58,440 --> 02:30:58,960
Yeah.

4667
02:30:59,100 --> 02:31:00,560
They're not gonna wear it.

4668
02:31:00,640 --> 02:31:01,740
You know the craziest thing?

4669
02:31:01,900 --> 02:31:06,560
Like, Fortnite players would buy so many skins, but the only skin they're gonna put on is the fucking condom skin.

4670
02:31:06,740 --> 02:31:08,280
Like, that's the craziest shit for me.

4671
02:31:08,980 --> 02:31:16,240
They would spend so much money on all these, like, themed skins, but they're just gonna run, like, one skin in the end.

4672
02:31:16,860 --> 02:31:22,240
I've always literally told others, like, you can be sweaty and wear whatever skin you want.

4673
02:31:23,240 --> 02:31:25,920
You can make Goku sweaty.

4674
02:31:27,420 --> 02:31:28,860
No, cause the hitbox!

4675
02:31:29,840 --> 02:31:31,840
Goku's hitbox is terrible!

4676
02:31:32,160 --> 02:31:32,580
That's why!

4677
02:31:32,940 --> 02:31:34,260
His shoulders are ugly.

4678
02:31:34,340 --> 02:31:35,820
That's the only thing bad about Goku.

4679
02:31:37,040 --> 02:31:39,480
And then the fact that he has a big outline.

4680
02:31:39,820 --> 02:31:40,880
Money, Batman.

4681
02:31:45,960 --> 02:31:47,740
Okay, what's your main skin?

4682
02:31:49,000 --> 02:31:49,520
Uh...

4683
02:31:50,120 --> 02:31:52,280
I can be the werewolf, dude.

4684
02:31:52,540 --> 02:31:54,500
Alright, then I'll be Tiger Man.

4685
02:31:55,680 --> 02:31:58,860
Or wait, or the Lieutenant John Lama?

4686
02:31:58,860 --> 02:31:59,140
What?

4687
02:31:59,140 --> 02:32:00,720
You have Lieutenant John Lama?

4688
02:32:00,820 --> 02:32:01,160
What?

4689
02:32:01,160 --> 02:32:02,160
Yeah, is he, like, rare?

4690
02:32:02,160 --> 02:32:02,900
I'm so joey.

4691
02:32:03,020 --> 02:32:03,700
Is he rare?

4692
02:32:03,740 --> 02:32:05,160
He's like an OG skin.

4693
02:32:05,500 --> 02:32:07,100
Oh, he's an OG skin?

4694
02:32:07,660 --> 02:32:08,140
Yeah.

4695
02:32:08,440 --> 02:32:08,920
Since when?

4696
02:32:09,000 --> 02:32:09,660
I've always wanted that skin.

4697
02:32:09,900 --> 02:32:12,280
I think it's, like, chapter two, I think.

4698
02:32:12,540 --> 02:32:13,920
When did this skin come out?

4699
02:32:15,380 --> 02:32:18,460
I think it was chapter two, like, early season or something.

4700
02:32:18,460 --> 02:32:19,740
It's chapter three, season one.

4701
02:32:20,300 --> 02:32:21,880
Oh, chapter three.

4702
02:32:23,060 --> 02:32:23,540
Dang.

4703
02:32:23,540 --> 02:32:24,420
When was chapter three?

4704
02:32:25,140 --> 02:32:28,320
I think that was the chapter when Zero Build came out.

4705
02:32:28,720 --> 02:32:29,200
Oh!

4706
02:32:30,320 --> 02:32:32,240
Zero Build came out, like, way later.

4707
02:32:32,400 --> 02:32:35,020
I think it was, like, chapter three, season three?

4708
02:32:35,500 --> 02:32:35,900
Oh!

4709
02:32:36,960 --> 02:32:37,560
Yeah, guys.

4710
02:32:37,740 --> 02:32:38,180
And then...

4711
02:32:38,180 --> 02:32:40,360
I have chapter... I have a rare skin.

4712
02:32:41,540 --> 02:32:42,440
That's fucking right.

4713
02:32:43,780 --> 02:32:45,700
Wait, is the code out yet or not?

4714
02:32:46,260 --> 02:32:47,000
No, it's not.

4715
02:32:47,160 --> 02:32:47,380
Okay.

4716
02:32:48,500 --> 02:32:50,600
Zero Build was, uh, started as an LTM?

4717
02:32:50,880 --> 02:32:53,160
Yeah, that's why I only played it for, like, a little bit.

4718
02:32:53,260 --> 02:32:54,420
I think that's why I got him.

4719
02:32:54,440 --> 02:32:56,840
I got him because I was like, oh, LTM.

4720
02:32:58,000 --> 02:32:58,400
Oh!

4721
02:32:58,580 --> 02:33:00,020
Was he around during the LTM?

4722
02:33:00,280 --> 02:33:00,800
I think so.

4723
02:33:01,080 --> 02:33:01,520
Was it?

4724
02:33:01,740 --> 02:33:02,140
Well...

4725
02:33:02,140 --> 02:33:05,680
And I missed out on getting... Oh, I probably, like, didn't even buy the battle pass at the time.

4726
02:33:05,740 --> 02:33:06,140
Maybe.

4727
02:33:06,160 --> 02:33:07,480
I think you didn't get the battle pass, yeah.

4728
02:33:07,620 --> 02:33:09,040
Because he must be a battle pass skin.

4729
02:33:09,480 --> 02:33:09,880
Yeah.

4730
02:33:10,440 --> 02:33:13,400
I remember thinking, like, I'm not gonna play Fortnite.

4731
02:33:13,460 --> 02:33:14,860
I'm not gonna main this game.

4732
02:33:15,540 --> 02:33:17,140
I'm gonna go back to Apex.

4733
02:33:17,180 --> 02:33:19,320
I mean, you're not really maining this game.

4734
02:33:19,640 --> 02:33:21,020
You're still not really.

4735
02:33:21,720 --> 02:33:22,120
Oh, okay.

4736
02:33:23,180 --> 02:33:25,560
I'm gonna have... I only play a little bit.

4737
02:33:25,720 --> 02:33:26,600
Brian on the back.

4738
02:33:27,680 --> 02:33:28,760
Oh, what are you playing on the back?

4739
02:33:28,820 --> 02:33:29,440
I'm playing Brian.

4740
02:33:30,500 --> 02:33:30,840
Brian?

4741
02:33:30,980 --> 02:33:31,200
Yeah.

4742
02:33:31,200 --> 02:33:32,620
Oh, you have the little, like, pinata Brian.

4743
02:33:32,760 --> 02:33:33,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4744
02:33:34,020 --> 02:33:34,620
And then...

4745
02:33:34,620 --> 02:33:35,680
I can put, uh...

4746
02:33:36,920 --> 02:33:38,340
I mean, I have the Brian, too.

4747
02:33:38,620 --> 02:33:39,580
I can put the Brian on.

4748
02:33:40,240 --> 02:33:41,800
Or I could put, um... No, put your main.

4749
02:33:41,960 --> 02:33:42,580
Put your main.

4750
02:33:42,760 --> 02:33:43,620
Maybe that's why.

4751
02:33:44,080 --> 02:33:46,820
You put all your main stuff on, and then maybe...

4752
02:33:46,820 --> 02:33:47,480
All my main stuff?

4753
02:33:47,540 --> 02:33:49,860
Yeah, put every main stuff in there.

4754
02:33:51,280 --> 02:33:51,960
Uh, okay.

4755
02:33:51,960 --> 02:33:52,500
For good luck.

4756
02:33:52,540 --> 02:33:53,560
That's the good luck charm.

4757
02:33:53,560 --> 02:33:54,140
Yeah.

4758
02:33:55,580 --> 02:33:56,480
I bet.

4759
02:33:58,180 --> 02:34:05,980
If we can't win... No, if we can't get past top 15 with that, then it's just... Then it was just meant to be.

4760
02:34:08,400 --> 02:34:10,700
Okay, think of it this way, though.

4761
02:34:10,780 --> 02:34:14,060
We got 15th for a short period of time.

4762
02:34:14,300 --> 02:34:14,860
That's true.

4763
02:34:15,060 --> 02:34:15,480
That's true.

4764
02:34:15,520 --> 02:34:16,900
We had 15th locked.

4765
02:34:17,340 --> 02:34:17,820
Yeah.

4766
02:34:17,840 --> 02:34:19,800
Until everyone started trying to grief us.

4767
02:34:19,820 --> 02:34:24,340
And then until everybody tried, like, knew what skins we were in and just went straight for us.

4768
02:34:25,300 --> 02:34:25,700
Everyone.

4769
02:34:26,460 --> 02:34:27,800
They don't hate us!

4770
02:34:28,080 --> 02:34:29,220
It's not fair!

4771
02:34:31,060 --> 02:34:32,360
Do you have any, like, girl skins?

4772
02:34:33,720 --> 02:34:34,120
Uh...

4773
02:34:34,920 --> 02:34:37,280
I don't think I... Yeah, I do, but they're not cool.

4774
02:34:38,760 --> 02:34:39,700
Well, what's, like...

4775
02:34:39,700 --> 02:34:41,300
What's the most uncool one that you have?

4776
02:34:41,820 --> 02:34:43,480
I'm, like, curious if it's, like, one of the...

4777
02:34:43,480 --> 02:34:45,080
If it's uncool, it means it's sweaty.

4778
02:34:46,000 --> 02:34:47,260
If it's uncool?

4779
02:34:47,880 --> 02:34:49,020
Yeah, it's uncool.

4780
02:34:49,100 --> 02:34:49,120
They're all uncool.

4781
02:34:50,060 --> 02:34:51,700
That means they're all sweaty.

4782
02:34:51,780 --> 02:34:53,360
I mean, they look good.

4783
02:34:53,560 --> 02:34:55,380
But, like, they're not, like...

4784
02:34:55,380 --> 02:34:56,860
Like, what's the word?

4785
02:34:56,940 --> 02:34:57,820
They're not, like, themed.

4786
02:34:57,840 --> 02:35:01,080
Yeah, they have cool designs, but they're not, like, themed to anything.

4787
02:35:01,600 --> 02:35:03,300
They're, like, Fortnite original characters.

4788
02:35:04,900 --> 02:35:06,620
Like, they're Fortnite OCs.

4789
02:35:06,880 --> 02:35:08,300
So, like, it's not cool.

4790
02:35:09,160 --> 02:35:12,400
Like, who wants to run Fortnite OCs?

4791
02:35:13,020 --> 02:35:15,120
When you can run fucking...

4792
02:35:15,120 --> 02:35:19,360
Okay, to be fair, Lieutenant John Lama is a Fortnite OC.

4793
02:35:19,600 --> 02:35:24,700
But, like, who wants to run Fortnite OCs when I can be literally John Cena, like...

4794
02:35:26,980 --> 02:35:28,100
That's all I'm saying.

4795
02:35:29,560 --> 02:35:32,440
Honestly, Fortnite players need to listen to your stream.

4796
02:35:33,140 --> 02:35:33,580
Yeah.

4797
02:35:33,700 --> 02:35:34,960
I think you'll inspire them.

4798
02:35:35,220 --> 02:35:36,800
I think Fortnite players are gonna hate me.

4799
02:35:42,900 --> 02:35:44,880
They'll hear what you're saying and be like, you know what?

4800
02:35:45,200 --> 02:35:46,100
Doki is right.

4801
02:35:47,020 --> 02:35:49,160
I think I need to listen to Doki's word.

4802
02:35:49,660 --> 02:35:54,380
Apex should also have these types of... like, Overwatch is starting to do, like, crossover skins.

4803
02:35:54,560 --> 02:35:58,980
Like, the Optimus Prime Overwatch skin is pretty dope.

4804
02:35:59,160 --> 02:36:04,280
But, like, Apex doesn't... I guess Apex did the Final Fantasy, but it's not the same.

4805
02:36:05,240 --> 02:36:07,640
They still made it... they made it too serious.

4806
02:36:08,320 --> 02:36:11,280
The problem that, like, Apex always does is they, like...

4807
02:36:11,280 --> 02:36:13,120
They do the whole...

4808
02:36:13,120 --> 02:36:14,860
They keep everything, like, Apex-y.

4809
02:36:15,340 --> 02:36:15,840
Yeah, yeah.

4810
02:36:15,840 --> 02:36:17,260
And then they, like, don't have fun with it.

4811
02:36:17,320 --> 02:36:19,140
Yeah, like, do what Call of Duty does.

4812
02:36:19,160 --> 02:36:21,020
They did and fucking put Nicki Minaj in there.

4813
02:36:21,160 --> 02:36:22,560
Like, just literally Nicki Minaj.

4814
02:36:22,820 --> 02:36:24,820
I literally want Nicki Minaj.

4815
02:36:24,840 --> 02:36:26,320
I only want to main that skin.

4816
02:36:26,540 --> 02:36:29,220
I like how they literally just put Nicki Minaj in the game.

4817
02:36:29,300 --> 02:36:30,160
Like, there's nothing different.

4818
02:36:30,240 --> 02:36:32,720
It's literally Nicki Minaj and also Snoop Dogg.

4819
02:36:34,560 --> 02:36:38,080
I got those skins so fast when I found out they were in-game.

4820
02:36:39,180 --> 02:36:40,260
Okay, we got code.

4821
02:36:40,440 --> 02:36:40,800
Nice.

4822
02:36:43,280 --> 02:36:45,260
You guys are 19th, but still above Jay?

4823
02:36:45,900 --> 02:36:46,880
Let's go Doki!

4824
02:36:47,160 --> 02:36:47,780
We're not dead last!

4825
02:36:47,780 --> 02:36:48,800
Wait, that means you're 20th.

4826
02:36:49,520 --> 02:36:50,780
We're not dead last!

4827
02:36:50,780 --> 02:36:51,820
Wait, they're 20th?

4828
02:36:51,840 --> 02:36:53,700
What's the fucking points for them?

4829
02:36:54,200 --> 02:36:54,820
Yeah, wait.

4830
02:36:54,880 --> 02:36:55,560
What are they getting?

4831
02:36:55,740 --> 02:36:56,260
What are they doing?

4832
02:36:56,760 --> 02:36:58,000
Are they getting one point?

4833
02:36:58,600 --> 02:36:59,260
Every time?

4834
02:36:59,620 --> 02:36:59,780
What?

4835
02:37:00,480 --> 02:37:02,160
Do they even play, like, Fortnite?

4836
02:37:03,560 --> 02:37:05,460
Wait, somebody got minus one.

4837
02:37:05,600 --> 02:37:06,640
Somebody got minus ten.

4838
02:37:07,720 --> 02:37:09,220
Oh, that's because they killed last game.

4839
02:37:09,280 --> 02:37:10,560
Remember when you were like, wait, they're rebooting.

4840
02:37:11,820 --> 02:37:12,700
Oh, wait.

4841
02:37:12,840 --> 02:37:14,520
But how are we above Jay then?

4842
02:37:14,760 --> 02:37:16,100
Oh, because he got one point.

4843
02:37:16,100 --> 02:37:17,160
Wait, so...

4844
02:37:18,140 --> 02:37:21,100
So, how are we, like, 19th if...

4845
02:37:22,880 --> 02:37:25,000
if somebody literally got minus ten?

4846
02:37:25,400 --> 02:37:28,520
Oh, because... Oh, they had high placement.

4847
02:37:28,740 --> 02:37:29,700
Okay, no...

4848
02:37:30,180 --> 02:37:31,400
Oh, they went...

4849
02:37:31,400 --> 02:37:32,800
They lost...

4850
02:37:34,120 --> 02:37:35,960
They only lost... Oh, they were third place.

4851
02:37:36,020 --> 02:37:36,480
That's why.

4852
02:37:36,580 --> 02:37:37,440
That makes much more sense.

4853
02:37:37,620 --> 02:37:38,620
Wait, they are 20th.

4854
02:37:39,300 --> 02:37:42,720
We also... We got, like, a bunch of kill points?

4855
02:37:43,040 --> 02:37:43,360
Yeah.

4856
02:37:43,360 --> 02:37:44,920
We've gotten, like, three.

4857
02:37:45,140 --> 02:37:46,580
Yeah, so they...

4858
02:37:46,580 --> 02:37:48,520
I mean, we gotta get that plus two.

4859
02:37:48,900 --> 02:37:52,320
They're literally getting points from the safe zone.

4860
02:37:52,420 --> 02:37:52,760
That's it.

4861
02:37:53,000 --> 02:37:55,200
They've been getting 1-1-1 this entire time.

4862
02:37:55,480 --> 02:37:56,240
Oh, that's what it is.

4863
02:37:56,700 --> 02:37:58,360
I'm gonna guess that they probably get jumped?

4864
02:37:58,960 --> 02:38:01,580
And then they're pretty much like, oh, well, GG.

4865
02:38:02,580 --> 02:38:06,360
Okay, all we need is, like, either a kill point or a placement.

4866
02:38:06,680 --> 02:38:07,620
And then we'll be safe.

4867
02:38:07,680 --> 02:38:08,220
We literally...

4868
02:38:08,220 --> 02:38:12,160
The team above us has the same points as us.

4869
02:38:13,020 --> 02:38:14,380
Oh, okay, okay.

4870
02:38:14,480 --> 02:38:14,920
Wait, really?

4871
02:38:15,160 --> 02:38:15,380
Yeah.

4872
02:38:15,500 --> 02:38:16,860
They're literally eight points.

4873
02:38:17,620 --> 02:38:17,960
What?

4874
02:38:18,160 --> 02:38:18,740
Okay.

4875
02:38:18,960 --> 02:38:19,300
Alright.

4876
02:38:19,820 --> 02:38:20,400
Doable?

4877
02:38:20,980 --> 02:38:22,500
Yeah, it's workable.

4878
02:38:22,820 --> 02:38:23,500
It's workable.

4879
02:38:23,740 --> 02:38:24,260
Wait, we got this?

4880
02:38:24,360 --> 02:38:25,300
We just gotta survive.

4881
02:38:25,700 --> 02:38:26,240
That's it.

4882
02:38:26,680 --> 02:38:27,260
Survive.

4883
02:38:28,740 --> 02:38:29,960
That's literally it.

4884
02:38:30,000 --> 02:38:32,940
I love how the whole tourney now is basically Jay versus Doki.

4885
02:38:34,840 --> 02:38:36,300
They started it!

4886
02:38:36,540 --> 02:38:38,980
They literally contested us!

4887
02:38:39,680 --> 02:38:40,520
Yeah, we were vibing.

4888
02:38:40,720 --> 02:38:41,960
We did nothing to anyone.

4889
02:38:41,980 --> 02:38:43,400
We were fucking vibing.

4890
02:38:44,520 --> 02:38:47,820
All we wanted was a pirate ship and some gloves to fit.

4891
02:38:47,860 --> 02:38:49,560
Yeah, and then they stayed there?

4892
02:38:49,900 --> 02:38:51,960
Like, who does that?

4893
02:38:55,120 --> 02:38:57,660
Like, we didn't wanna start this fight.

4894
02:38:57,760 --> 02:38:59,220
They threw the first rock.

4895
02:39:01,440 --> 02:39:02,860
Actually, yeah, you're right.

4896
02:39:03,140 --> 02:39:05,400
They literally threw the first rock.

4897
02:39:05,560 --> 02:39:08,020
We were literally chillin', and then you're like, wait.

4898
02:39:08,260 --> 02:39:09,600
Wait, why is there people here?

4899
02:39:09,820 --> 02:39:11,220
And then they shot at us.

4900
02:39:11,220 --> 02:39:11,520
Yeah!

4901
02:39:11,520 --> 02:39:14,000
And then they shot at us, and then one of them tried to flank me!

4902
02:39:15,420 --> 02:39:16,120
And then we were like, nah, bitch.

4903
02:39:16,120 --> 02:39:17,780
And then my bodyguard came over.

4904
02:39:19,640 --> 02:39:20,340
Got one.

4905
02:39:20,580 --> 02:39:21,700
It was like...

4906
02:39:23,060 --> 02:39:25,340
It was like, drop down, Doki!

4907
02:39:27,140 --> 02:39:29,240
Get down, Mrs. Doki President!

4908
02:39:30,920 --> 02:39:32,980
You were... No, I didn't.

4909
02:39:33,000 --> 02:39:35,460
I was very nice throughout this entire tournament.

4910
02:39:35,820 --> 02:39:37,280
I was very nice.

4911
02:39:37,460 --> 02:39:38,500
I was a nice person.

4912
02:39:38,500 --> 02:39:40,280
We've done nothing but be nice.

4913
02:39:40,480 --> 02:39:42,820
Yeah, we literally was in our own...

4914
02:39:42,820 --> 02:39:47,760
We were in our own lane, and then fucking J3... All the condoms.

4915
02:39:48,020 --> 02:39:53,480
Then J3, like, like, fucking bursted in, and was like, I wanna be here too.

4916
02:39:55,020 --> 02:39:55,840
Like, they're...

4917
02:39:56,680 --> 02:40:02,360
What's it called when somebody, like, um, when somebody like, lives at your place for free?

4918
02:40:03,940 --> 02:40:04,440
Squatters!

4919
02:40:04,540 --> 02:40:05,420
They're literally squatters!

4920
02:40:05,420 --> 02:40:06,220
Oh, squatters!

4921
02:40:06,320 --> 02:40:07,060
They're squatters!

4922
02:40:07,180 --> 02:40:07,280
That's my house!

4923
02:40:07,580 --> 02:40:09,080
We claimed it first!

4924
02:40:09,280 --> 02:40:10,380
Yeah, what the...

4925
02:40:10,960 --> 02:40:12,820
Yeah, we're the ones that pay rent at your gate.

4926
02:40:12,840 --> 02:40:13,480
They're squatters!

4927
02:40:14,600 --> 02:40:16,080
We paid rent there!

4928
02:40:16,640 --> 02:40:22,920
And then they attracted all the other pro players, cause they're like, look at the 19th and 20th plays fighting each other.

4929
02:40:26,280 --> 02:40:28,600
So everyone's just bullying the kids at the playground.

4930
02:40:28,600 --> 02:40:30,140
Dude, then they all come to us!

4931
02:40:33,560 --> 02:40:37,280
You know, it's so fucking, like, you know what's even funnier about that too?

4932
02:40:37,340 --> 02:40:39,940
Remember when you were like, they're running up on you when I was, like, going up the hill?

4933
02:40:40,160 --> 02:40:40,520
Yeah!

4934
02:40:40,820 --> 02:40:45,300
They were literally watching us go back to Grim Gate the entire time.

4935
02:40:45,640 --> 02:40:47,180
And then they watched us fight.

4936
02:40:47,500 --> 02:40:49,760
And then another team pulled up to watch us fight.

4937
02:40:55,240 --> 02:40:59,380
I'm gonna use that term now and be like, stop fucking squatting on our POI.

4938
02:40:59,380 --> 02:41:00,160
We pay for this.

4939
02:41:00,280 --> 02:41:00,300
Yeah!

4940
02:41:01,020 --> 02:41:01,540
We pay for this.

4941
02:41:01,540 --> 02:41:02,520
You just contest people?

4942
02:41:03,100 --> 02:41:04,240
You don't do that!

4943
02:41:05,680 --> 02:41:06,720
That's so fucked.

4944
02:41:07,460 --> 02:41:08,660
I'm gonna gritty on them.

4945
02:41:09,340 --> 02:41:10,340
Are we a lot of gritty?

4946
02:41:10,360 --> 02:41:11,380
We can gritty on people, right?

4947
02:41:11,580 --> 02:41:14,400
Yeah, we're a lot to emote on them.

4948
02:41:14,740 --> 02:41:16,000
Alright, we're gonna gritty on people.

4949
02:41:16,440 --> 02:41:22,420
Well, if we can kill somebody, like... Okay, if we kill Jay again, we're gonna...

4950
02:41:23,680 --> 02:41:24,560
We're gonna do the gritty.

4951
02:41:24,640 --> 02:41:26,800
We're gonna do the Fortnite dance.

4952
02:41:27,020 --> 02:41:28,500
I'm gonna get some pho for dinner.

4953
02:41:29,000 --> 02:41:29,320
Oh!

4954
02:41:29,760 --> 02:41:30,600
I've been craving some pho.

4955
02:41:30,600 --> 02:41:31,660
I've been craving some pho.

4956
02:41:32,240 --> 02:41:33,480
I love pho.

4957
02:41:34,200 --> 02:41:35,740
Alright, I'm gonna reward myself.

4958
02:41:35,920 --> 02:41:38,740
Okay, Dory, we have to be a higher placement than Jay, okay?

4959
02:41:39,280 --> 02:41:40,700
Okay, we're gonna be a higher placement.

4960
02:41:41,100 --> 02:41:42,480
Like, you gotta promise me.

4961
02:41:43,140 --> 02:41:44,120
Oh, there's James!

4962
02:41:44,200 --> 02:41:45,500
Wait, there's another John Llama!

4963
02:41:45,680 --> 02:41:46,300
Wait, who's this?

4964
02:41:46,580 --> 02:41:47,040
Who's this?

4965
02:41:47,540 --> 02:41:48,400
This one's a purple.

4966
02:41:48,420 --> 02:41:49,760
Wait, is this the OG John Llama?

4967
02:41:49,800 --> 02:41:50,720
Because he's purple.

4968
02:41:51,460 --> 02:41:52,520
And that's the OG.

4969
02:41:52,640 --> 02:41:53,780
I'm just the imposter.

4970
02:41:55,120 --> 02:41:56,720
They're just looking at each other.

4971
02:41:57,160 --> 02:41:58,940
They're like, same person.

4972
02:41:59,440 --> 02:42:01,640
Okay, so remember, we're gonna land on the thingy.

4973
02:42:01,860 --> 02:42:02,300
Yeah.

4974
02:42:02,300 --> 02:42:03,320
We got this?

4975
02:42:03,700 --> 02:42:04,500
We got this?

4976
02:42:04,520 --> 02:42:05,500
I don't know, but okay.

4977
02:42:07,040 --> 02:42:11,340
Dory, um, to motivate you, I will not get pho if we're not above Jay.

4978
02:42:11,880 --> 02:42:12,200
No!

4979
02:42:12,540 --> 02:42:15,520
Okay, we're gonna beat them right now.

4980
02:42:15,660 --> 02:42:17,160
I will not get pho.

4981
02:42:17,300 --> 02:42:17,520
We are getting you that pho.

4982
02:42:17,920 --> 02:42:19,000
We are getting you that pho.

4983
02:42:19,040 --> 02:42:19,200
Did you?

4984
02:42:19,320 --> 02:42:19,320
Did you?

4985
02:42:19,320 --> 02:42:20,700
Oh my god, you fucking dropped already.

4986
02:42:20,800 --> 02:42:21,540
I was, like, looking.

4987
02:42:21,540 --> 02:42:22,600
I was like, did you drop this?

4988
02:42:22,600 --> 02:42:23,500
I wasn't even mine!

4989
02:42:23,580 --> 02:42:24,560
That's someone else's crown.

4990
02:42:26,100 --> 02:42:27,440
Why am I looking at this die?

4991
02:42:27,940 --> 02:42:29,400
Like, I didn't know where you were.

4992
02:42:29,460 --> 02:42:30,540
I was, like, trying to find you.

4993
02:42:30,580 --> 02:42:31,760
No, I was like, where are you?

4994
02:42:31,780 --> 02:42:33,180
I couldn't find you.

4995
02:42:37,300 --> 02:42:38,440
Oh my god, please.

4996
02:42:38,600 --> 02:42:39,360
Oh my god, please.

4997
02:42:39,580 --> 02:42:41,100
Please tell me I make it.

4998
02:42:42,200 --> 02:42:43,720
Please tell me I make it.

4999
02:42:43,780 --> 02:42:43,940
Please tell me I make it.

5000
02:42:43,940 --> 02:42:43,960
So, uh...

5001
02:42:43,960 --> 02:42:46,400
Everybody has that strat, I don't...

5002
02:42:46,920 --> 02:42:49,860
So, uh... I don't know if the strat is, like, I don't know if the strat is, like, a good strat.

5003
02:42:50,060 --> 02:42:51,380
Uh, I mean, we get- Oh!

5004
02:42:51,880 --> 02:42:52,660
Don't get a gun idea!

5005
02:42:52,840 --> 02:42:53,080
What?

5006
02:42:53,120 --> 02:42:54,100
Oh, no, no, don't do that.

5007
02:42:54,260 --> 02:42:56,900
Do the same strat, do the same strat, do the same strat, do the same strat.

5008
02:42:56,960 --> 02:42:58,700
Okay, um... No, we're not doing it!

5009
02:42:58,920 --> 02:42:59,620
I'm scared.

5010
02:43:01,640 --> 02:43:02,980
Oh my god!

5011
02:43:03,080 --> 02:43:03,800
I'm scared.

5012
02:43:03,920 --> 02:43:04,920
I'm still drifting down.

5013
02:43:04,920 --> 02:43:04,920
Oh my god!

5014
02:43:14,020 --> 02:43:15,680
I couldn't adjust it.

5015
02:43:15,700 --> 02:43:17,220
I couldn't adjust it.

5016
02:43:17,220 --> 02:43:18,480
There was nothing I could do.

5017
02:43:18,620 --> 02:43:20,740
I was like, I don't think this is...

5018
02:43:27,680 --> 02:43:29,180
I was like doing this.

5019
02:43:29,240 --> 02:43:31,860
I was like, I don't like this strap because of that.

5020
02:43:34,220 --> 02:43:35,680
Wait, you're not allowed to be on the car!

5021
02:43:36,640 --> 02:43:38,120
I forgot, I forgot, I forgot.

5022
02:43:38,220 --> 02:43:38,480
I'm dead.

5023
02:43:38,540 --> 02:43:38,900
Oh no!

5024
02:43:39,940 --> 02:43:40,420
No!

5025
02:43:41,120 --> 02:43:42,540
It's okay, we got two points.

5026
02:43:42,720 --> 02:43:43,860
We got two points.

5027
02:43:44,680 --> 02:43:45,920
Wait, how did you die?

5028
02:43:46,220 --> 02:43:48,840
I got chased by the guy that killed you.

5029
02:43:49,160 --> 02:43:49,940
Wait, what?

5030
02:43:50,240 --> 02:43:52,680
Why wasn't you got chased?

5031
02:43:53,200 --> 02:43:56,500
I was gonna literally go to grab your card.

5032
02:43:56,900 --> 02:43:58,200
Wait, you came back?

5033
02:43:58,300 --> 02:43:59,120
Why did you come back?

5034
02:43:59,580 --> 02:44:01,600
Cause I was gonna catch you.

5035
02:44:01,860 --> 02:44:03,400
Why did you come back?

5036
02:44:03,700 --> 02:44:05,060
You could have lived!

5037
02:44:08,160 --> 02:44:10,780
I can't believe you came back.

5038
02:44:10,820 --> 02:44:10,920
I can't believe you came back.

5039
02:44:10,920 --> 02:44:13,160
I'm not getting far today apparently, guys.

5040
02:44:13,560 --> 02:44:15,800
Guys, I'm not getting far.

5041
02:44:20,600 --> 02:44:23,460
I can't believe you went back.

5042
02:44:24,480 --> 02:44:26,740
I wasn't gonna leave you behind.

5043
02:44:26,900 --> 02:44:28,660
I was gonna get you.

5044
02:44:28,660 --> 02:44:31,040
You should have left me behind for Fa!

5045
02:44:31,560 --> 02:44:36,380
You should have You should have left me behind!

5046
02:44:36,760 --> 02:44:38,340
Fa was more important!

5047
02:44:38,820 --> 02:44:41,860
He was so much more important!

5048
02:44:44,700 --> 02:44:45,340
Noooo!

5049
02:44:46,160 --> 02:44:50,400
I knew I fucked up when I was like I'm slowly drifting down.

5050
02:44:52,060 --> 02:44:55,580
Well, do you wanna go play a match?

5051
02:44:55,580 --> 02:44:57,360
Yeah, let's play a match.

5052
02:44:57,380 --> 02:44:58,640
They don't deserve my views.

5053
02:44:58,860 --> 02:44:59,520
They don't.

5054
02:45:00,940 --> 02:45:04,200
Okay, look, the last game, it's all on you.

5055
02:45:04,540 --> 02:45:06,980
The last game we have...

5056
02:45:06,980 --> 02:45:09,660
If I die, don't come back for me.

5057
02:45:11,620 --> 02:45:13,840
But I can't leave you behind.

5058
02:45:14,000 --> 02:45:17,460
You have to or I'm never getting Fa.

5059
02:45:18,980 --> 02:45:20,780
I will do it for the Fa.

5060
02:45:20,840 --> 02:45:21,980
I will only get for Fa.

5061
02:45:22,680 --> 02:45:24,060
That'll be the only thing.

5062
02:45:25,000 --> 02:45:26,700
Otherwise, never leave.

5063
02:45:26,940 --> 02:45:29,960
You have to leave me or I'll never get it.

5064
02:45:30,320 --> 02:45:32,600
Never leaving a John Cena behind, ever.

5065
02:45:34,200 --> 02:45:37,320
How does John Cena leave himself behind in the first place?

5066
02:45:38,300 --> 02:45:39,160
What do you mean?

5067
02:45:39,180 --> 02:45:40,000
I'm not John Cena.

5068
02:45:40,060 --> 02:45:42,740
I'm fucking Lieutenant Lam or whatever.

5069
02:45:43,140 --> 02:45:44,900
Yeah, but what if John Cena's under that though?

5070
02:45:45,160 --> 02:45:45,840
John Llama?

5071
02:45:46,000 --> 02:45:47,180
No, there's no way.

5072
02:45:47,420 --> 02:45:48,740
Because then why could we see him?

5073
02:45:49,040 --> 02:45:50,120
But why is his name John?

5074
02:45:51,980 --> 02:45:52,820
John Wick John too.

5075
02:45:54,560 --> 02:45:55,320
I mean, maybe...

5076
02:45:55,880 --> 02:45:57,800
Maybe I'll be the first skin I ever bought.

5077
02:45:58,100 --> 02:45:59,700
Yo, I have that skin too.

5078
02:45:59,900 --> 02:46:01,500
This is the first skin I ever bought.

5079
02:46:01,640 --> 02:46:02,460
Wait, really?

5080
02:46:02,940 --> 02:46:05,740
Yo, alright, alright.

5081
02:46:05,920 --> 02:46:06,880
I'm doing it, I'm doing it.

5082
02:46:06,880 --> 02:46:10,760
For the final match, maybe this will actually bring me luck.

5083
02:46:11,020 --> 02:46:13,220
The very first skin I ever bought.

5084
02:46:16,300 --> 02:46:17,860
We're both gonna be candy cane men.

5085
02:46:19,040 --> 02:46:20,500
Or John Cena's under here.

5086
02:46:20,680 --> 02:46:21,160
Come on, leave me.

5087
02:46:21,980 --> 02:46:23,640
No, we have small hitboxes now.

5088
02:46:23,820 --> 02:46:24,820
Look, our hitboxes.

5089
02:46:24,820 --> 02:46:24,860
Oh, you have the snake!

5090
02:46:25,340 --> 02:46:27,800
Wait, why are you like the same?

5091
02:46:27,920 --> 02:46:29,120
We're gonna be nerds.

5092
02:46:29,120 --> 02:46:30,820
Only nerds have the same skin, remember?

5093
02:46:31,460 --> 02:46:32,720
Oh shit, no!

5094
02:46:33,680 --> 02:46:35,940
No, we're nerds!

5095
02:46:36,860 --> 02:46:39,860
We became the thing we hated the most!

5096
02:46:43,000 --> 02:46:44,120
Wait, do you have a different thing?

5097
02:46:44,180 --> 02:46:45,240
Oh, you have a pickle rick on your back.

5098
02:46:45,520 --> 02:46:46,340
Yeah, the pickle rick.

5099
02:46:46,540 --> 02:46:47,740
Yeah, but we're the same!

5100
02:46:47,940 --> 02:46:49,760
We're fucking nerds now!

5101
02:46:49,760 --> 02:46:51,900
I don't have a pickle rick on my back, though!

5102
02:46:52,000 --> 02:46:52,280
No!

5103
02:46:54,640 --> 02:46:56,840
Pickle rick was the first backpack I ever bought.

5104
02:46:57,540 --> 02:46:59,880
I can't remember what the first one I ever bought was, too.

5105
02:47:00,720 --> 02:47:01,860
I think it might have been a...

5106
02:47:01,860 --> 02:47:02,400
Wait, no.

5107
02:47:02,800 --> 02:47:03,760
I got it way later.

5108
02:47:04,720 --> 02:47:05,520
Wait, where do you wanna go?

5109
02:47:05,560 --> 02:47:06,040
Do you wanna go here?

5110
02:47:07,560 --> 02:47:08,520
Wait, where do you land?

5111
02:47:08,640 --> 02:47:09,100
Yeah, let's do it.

5112
02:47:09,260 --> 02:47:09,880
Let's just fight.

5113
02:47:09,900 --> 02:47:10,800
Okay, let's go to Nitrodome.

5114
02:47:11,620 --> 02:47:12,660
Let's just fucking fight.

5115
02:47:14,080 --> 02:47:15,520
Yo, what's up, nerds?

5116
02:47:15,840 --> 02:47:18,380
Oh my god, if I could, I would wear a condom skin, too.

5117
02:47:19,720 --> 02:47:24,760
I feel like the moment you wear the condom skin, people would think you're, like, a tryhard and they're scared of you.

5118
02:47:25,220 --> 02:47:26,400
Oh, that's always what they do.

5119
02:47:26,580 --> 02:47:30,900
Yeah, like, I wish I had it just to, like, pretend to be, like, a tryhard.

5120
02:47:31,960 --> 02:47:33,000
No, don't say that!

5121
02:47:33,480 --> 02:47:34,880
So people would run away.

5122
02:47:35,160 --> 02:47:37,400
So people would run away when they see it.

5123
02:47:38,740 --> 02:47:41,160
It's, like, the only reason why I want it on.

5124
02:47:42,720 --> 02:47:44,660
The psychological battle, exactly.

5125
02:47:44,980 --> 02:47:46,320
Oh my gosh, which one is the gun?

5126
02:47:47,100 --> 02:47:47,940
Oh, they're there it is.

5127
02:47:50,520 --> 02:47:51,480
I got a gun.

5128
02:47:56,690 --> 02:47:58,670
Ooh, I hear people fighting.

5129
02:48:06,880 --> 02:48:07,360
Okay.

5130
02:48:08,140 --> 02:48:09,040
Undead Badger?

5131
02:48:09,100 --> 02:48:09,320
Alright.

5132
02:48:09,540 --> 02:48:10,460
That has to be a bot.

5133
02:48:10,580 --> 02:48:11,780
There's no way this guy's real.

5134
02:48:13,420 --> 02:48:13,900
Like...

5135
02:48:15,600 --> 02:48:20,120
I refuse to believe some guy actually named himself Undead Badger.

5136
02:48:26,410 --> 02:48:28,070
Wait, are you okay over there, Dorio?

5137
02:48:30,650 --> 02:48:31,070
Yeah, I was muted.

5138
02:48:31,230 --> 02:48:32,150
Yeah, you were muted.

5139
02:48:32,510 --> 02:48:33,630
I was so muted?

5140
02:48:33,730 --> 02:48:36,350
I was like, wait, what if the guy's an Undead Badger?

5141
02:48:36,590 --> 02:48:38,030
I was like...

5142
02:48:38,030 --> 02:48:39,750
What if he enjoys Undead Badgers?

5143
02:48:40,030 --> 02:48:40,910
There's no way.

5144
02:48:41,350 --> 02:48:44,950
Bot names are always, like, two... an adjective and a noun.

5145
02:48:45,890 --> 02:48:47,710
Essentially, like, bot name 101.

5146
02:48:49,410 --> 02:48:50,230
Wait, are you...

5147
02:48:50,230 --> 02:48:50,990
Oh, I'm coming over.

5148
02:48:50,990 --> 02:48:52,410
Oh, I just... I almost killed this guy.

5149
02:48:54,130 --> 02:48:54,890
Where is he?

5150
02:48:55,450 --> 02:48:56,530
Where is he?

5151
02:48:56,630 --> 02:48:57,670
Get that fucker.

5152
02:48:58,150 --> 02:48:59,050
Yeah, come here, bitch.

5153
02:48:59,490 --> 02:49:00,390
Yeah, come over here.

5154
02:49:01,330 --> 02:49:03,910
I got bullied by pro players, so I'm gonna bully you now.

5155
02:49:03,950 --> 02:49:04,350
It's a cycle.

5156
02:49:04,570 --> 02:49:05,490
Yeah, I got him.

5157
02:49:05,490 --> 02:49:06,250
It's a fucking cycle.

5158
02:49:07,050 --> 02:49:08,370
You can never stop it.

5159
02:49:08,970 --> 02:49:10,630
Oh my god, he had such a good gun?

5160
02:49:10,710 --> 02:49:10,950
Hello?

5161
02:49:11,470 --> 02:49:12,030
Uh-huh.

5162
02:49:12,610 --> 02:49:14,090
I need, like, shields.

5163
02:49:14,630 --> 02:49:15,370
Oh, I got shields.

5164
02:49:15,510 --> 02:49:16,470
I can toss you, too.

5165
02:49:16,670 --> 02:49:17,890
Oh, I see someone on me.

5166
02:49:17,950 --> 02:49:18,730
I see someone on me.

5167
02:49:18,950 --> 02:49:19,330
Yeah.

5168
02:49:19,610 --> 02:49:20,170
I'm here.

5169
02:49:20,350 --> 02:49:20,750
Wait.

5170
02:49:21,670 --> 02:49:22,270
I don't know.

5171
02:49:22,290 --> 02:49:22,890
Did he see me?

5172
02:49:22,990 --> 02:49:23,090
They're coming upstairs?

5173
02:49:24,090 --> 02:49:24,870
Where did he go?

5174
02:49:25,730 --> 02:49:26,830
Oh, he ran this way.

5175
02:49:28,290 --> 02:49:29,150
Where did he go?

5176
02:49:29,270 --> 02:49:29,450
Wait.

5177
02:49:29,530 --> 02:49:30,270
No, that's a bot.

5178
02:49:30,910 --> 02:49:31,390
Wait, what?

5179
02:49:31,630 --> 02:49:32,750
Where's this other guy at?

5180
02:49:33,170 --> 02:49:33,790
Oh, I'm here.

5181
02:49:33,990 --> 02:49:34,350
I'm here.

5182
02:49:34,530 --> 02:49:35,190
Yes, I'm true.

5183
02:49:36,250 --> 02:49:36,910
Oh, I cracked.

5184
02:49:37,190 --> 02:49:37,770
I shot the wrong guy.

5185
02:49:38,030 --> 02:49:38,850
I shot the bot.

5186
02:49:39,390 --> 02:49:40,410
He's gonna kill me.

5187
02:49:41,410 --> 02:49:41,950
Wait, no.

5188
02:49:41,950 --> 02:49:42,570
You got him.

5189
02:49:42,790 --> 02:49:44,290
Wait, I'm gonna shoot the bot.

5190
02:49:44,390 --> 02:49:45,050
I'm gonna shoot the bot.

5191
02:49:45,630 --> 02:49:46,410
Okay, okay, okay.

5192
02:49:46,510 --> 02:49:48,450
I got the bot so I could steal his gun.

5193
02:49:48,630 --> 02:49:49,230
It was planned.

5194
02:49:49,970 --> 02:49:50,690
Oh, shit.

5195
02:49:50,770 --> 02:49:51,190
Oh, no.

5196
02:49:51,250 --> 02:49:52,370
Now they all wanna kill me.

5197
02:49:52,430 --> 02:49:53,270
Wait, is this a bot, too?

5198
02:49:53,770 --> 02:49:54,770
Yeah, this is a bot.

5199
02:49:55,330 --> 02:49:57,490
I think this guy's over here, so...

5200
02:49:57,490 --> 02:49:58,170
No, please.

5201
02:49:58,230 --> 02:49:58,730
I'm sorry.

5202
02:49:58,850 --> 02:49:59,470
I didn't mean to shoot you.

5203
02:49:59,470 --> 02:49:59,490
Oh, yeah.

5204
02:49:59,530 --> 02:49:59,930
He is here.

5205
02:50:00,910 --> 02:50:01,310
Please.

5206
02:50:04,070 --> 02:50:04,970
Oh, where'd he go?

5207
02:50:05,190 --> 02:50:06,150
Where did he go?

5208
02:50:06,310 --> 02:50:06,890
Over here.

5209
02:50:07,410 --> 02:50:08,130
I got him.

5210
02:50:08,330 --> 02:50:09,690
Broke guy 1093.

5211
02:50:10,450 --> 02:50:11,150
Oh, my God.

5212
02:50:11,190 --> 02:50:11,350
He has so many stuff.

5213
02:50:11,350 --> 02:50:11,530
Oh, my God.

5214
02:50:11,550 --> 02:50:12,610
He has so many stuff.

5215
02:50:13,690 --> 02:50:14,090
What?

5216
02:50:14,290 --> 02:50:15,830
He has a laser rifle.

5217
02:50:16,410 --> 02:50:17,970
He has a shield bubble.

5218
02:50:18,450 --> 02:50:19,630
You know what he doesn't have?

5219
02:50:19,630 --> 02:50:20,390
He doesn't have beaches.

5220
02:50:20,930 --> 02:50:21,990
Oh, that's true.

5221
02:50:22,090 --> 02:50:22,890
He plays Fortnite.

5222
02:50:23,390 --> 02:50:25,210
Yeah, he does have a giant candy cane body.

5223
02:50:27,170 --> 02:50:28,190
That's freaking true.

5224
02:50:31,190 --> 02:50:31,930
Oops, that's me.

5225
02:50:32,030 --> 02:50:32,410
Is that the boss?

5226
02:50:33,050 --> 02:50:33,670
I don't know.

5227
02:50:34,470 --> 02:50:35,650
Here, I'm gonna give you a...

5228
02:50:36,830 --> 02:50:37,150
Nice.

5229
02:50:37,950 --> 02:50:39,670
I wasn't gonna do anything with it, but nice.

5230
02:50:42,530 --> 02:50:44,070
Oh, you can tell me, like, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

5231
02:50:44,530 --> 02:50:45,630
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

5232
02:50:50,570 --> 02:50:51,550
Where were they?

5233
02:50:52,890 --> 02:50:53,170
Oh, there she is.

5234
02:50:54,810 --> 02:50:56,190
Wait, what do you get from there?

5235
02:50:56,650 --> 02:50:58,030
Oh, you get unlimited ammo.

5236
02:50:58,070 --> 02:50:59,410
Yeah, you can get it.

5237
02:50:59,550 --> 02:51:00,390
Yeah, get that shit.

5238
02:51:00,570 --> 02:51:01,710
Okay, you get that, then.

5239
02:51:01,890 --> 02:51:02,990
No, no, no, you get that.

5240
02:51:03,070 --> 02:51:03,310
You get that.

5241
02:51:03,330 --> 02:51:03,730
No, it's fine.

5242
02:51:03,850 --> 02:51:04,250
It's fine.

5243
02:51:04,530 --> 02:51:07,070
Oh, okay.

5244
02:51:07,790 --> 02:51:09,690
Oh, what's this?

5245
02:51:10,650 --> 02:51:11,810
That's an explosive crossbow.

5246
02:51:12,110 --> 02:51:12,750
Is it good?

5247
02:51:13,750 --> 02:51:14,550
It's pretty good, yeah.

5248
02:51:14,790 --> 02:51:16,070
It, like, messes up cars.

5249
02:51:16,170 --> 02:51:16,710
Oh, look at this guy.

5250
02:51:16,790 --> 02:51:17,310
This guy here.

5251
02:51:17,450 --> 02:51:19,670
Oh, like this car?

5252
02:51:20,230 --> 02:51:21,690
What the fuck?

5253
02:51:21,690 --> 02:51:22,410
That's not you!

5254
02:51:25,130 --> 02:51:29,690
I was like, I was like, yay, and I turned around.

5255
02:51:29,910 --> 02:51:30,730
I was like, who's that?

5256
02:51:31,330 --> 02:51:32,490
I'm so sad.

5257
02:51:32,530 --> 02:51:34,730
It put the thing in the wrong eye of sight for me.

5258
02:51:34,830 --> 02:51:35,690
I was like, I didn't realize that.

5259
02:51:35,850 --> 02:51:38,770
I didn't realize we got fucking ran out.

5260
02:51:40,530 --> 02:51:43,490
I was just like, look at that car.

5261
02:51:43,630 --> 02:51:44,950
I was like, oh, hey, there's a car.

5262
02:51:45,150 --> 02:51:47,470
There's some guy showing up beside me.

5263
02:51:47,670 --> 02:51:48,730
I was so...

5264
02:51:50,650 --> 02:51:54,150
There's a guy showing up beside me the moment you said that.

5265
02:51:54,170 --> 02:51:55,310
I thought that was you.

5266
02:51:55,670 --> 02:51:57,130
I was like, there's a guy...

5267
02:51:57,850 --> 02:51:59,970
Yeah, and he's like, get out of nowhere!

5268
02:52:02,790 --> 02:52:04,970
Yeah, you thought you get no audio in Apex only?

5269
02:52:05,550 --> 02:52:07,270
Oh, there's no audio in here, too.

5270
02:52:07,470 --> 02:52:09,210
Four nights a week, you can have it.

5271
02:52:09,330 --> 02:52:11,510
The music made it so I couldn't hear.

5272
02:52:12,650 --> 02:52:13,430
I couldn't.

5273
02:52:13,430 --> 02:52:14,430
I just saw a car.

5274
02:52:17,710 --> 02:52:20,170
I thought you were just casually picking up stuff.

5275
02:52:20,450 --> 02:52:20,510
I thought you were just casually picking up stuff.

5276
02:52:20,510 --> 02:52:21,390
Yeah, it's like, yay!

5277
02:52:21,510 --> 02:52:22,190
Oh, the car is here!

5278
02:52:22,190 --> 02:52:23,190
There's somebody like a dude right next to you.

5279
02:52:23,230 --> 02:52:25,370
I'll be like, oh, I'll use this over the car.

5280
02:52:25,770 --> 02:52:26,870
I'll be like, oh, I'll use this over the car.

5281
02:52:28,190 --> 02:52:28,590
Oh, my god.

5282
02:52:28,650 --> 02:52:32,030
Oh, my god.

5283
02:52:32,170 --> 02:52:32,870
That was so funny.

5284
02:52:32,950 --> 02:52:35,590
You gotta run the wolf skin on the last game.

5285
02:52:36,010 --> 02:52:36,970
I'm running the wolf skin?

5286
02:52:36,970 --> 02:52:38,670
Yeah, for good luck, because it's your main.

5287
02:52:39,130 --> 02:52:41,570
And then I'll run the very first skin I ever bought.

5288
02:52:41,570 --> 02:52:42,970
Are you gonna be the candy cane?

5289
02:52:43,170 --> 02:52:44,170
Yeah, the candy cane.

5290
02:52:44,310 --> 02:52:45,310
The very first skin.

5291
02:52:45,510 --> 02:52:46,650
Oh, candy cane and wolf?

5292
02:52:47,010 --> 02:52:47,510
Yeah.

5293
02:52:48,750 --> 02:52:50,650
Oh, my god, it's Billie Eilish.

5294
02:52:51,270 --> 02:52:52,310
Billie Eilish?

5295
02:52:52,470 --> 02:52:53,230
Look at her go.

5296
02:52:53,690 --> 02:52:54,930
She's going, look at her.

5297
02:52:55,330 --> 02:52:56,250
Look at her go.

5298
02:52:58,350 --> 02:52:58,870
Yay!

5299
02:52:59,670 --> 02:53:01,670
I'm having a bad day, Billie.

5300
02:53:01,790 --> 02:53:03,670
Can you, like, cheer me up?

5301
02:53:04,130 --> 02:53:06,110
Oh, look, Billie's making a rape for us.

5302
02:53:06,290 --> 02:53:07,390
Oh, thank you, Billie.

5303
02:53:07,570 --> 02:53:10,750
I've been getting bullied by Fortnite pros all day.

5304
02:53:10,890 --> 02:53:11,930
Last two days.

5305
02:53:12,010 --> 02:53:13,330
Today's my rest week.

5306
02:53:13,970 --> 02:53:18,050
And then I'm getting bullied by grown men.

5307
02:53:18,430 --> 02:53:21,050
I was gonna say, what are you getting bullied by next week?

5308
02:53:22,610 --> 02:53:24,230
What's the next thing you're gonna get bullied by?

5309
02:53:26,190 --> 02:53:28,850
Are you gonna get bullied by Minecraft players next week?

5310
02:53:29,130 --> 02:53:30,370
Oh, I was.

5311
02:53:30,450 --> 02:53:32,090
I did have that happen, too.

5312
02:53:32,370 --> 02:53:33,130
Wait, did you actually?

5313
02:53:33,250 --> 02:53:36,670
Yeah, I was in the Minecraft Twitch Rivals and I got bullied by Minecraft players.

5314
02:53:37,070 --> 02:53:38,130
Wait, what happened?

5315
02:53:39,730 --> 02:53:41,010
Wait, all of a sudden, I got bullied.

5316
02:53:42,250 --> 02:53:42,690
Okay.

5317
02:53:43,450 --> 02:53:44,910
Let's go to the log place again.

5318
02:53:45,190 --> 02:53:45,570
Okay.

5319
02:53:47,350 --> 02:53:49,670
We got to shoot our guns.

5320
02:53:49,730 --> 02:53:50,570
We had action.

5321
02:53:51,910 --> 02:53:55,870
Literally became an anime character that featured candy canes.

5322
02:53:55,870 --> 02:53:56,230
Ooh!

5323
02:53:57,310 --> 02:53:58,430
That sounds fun.

5324
02:53:59,570 --> 02:54:02,390
Did we get Isekai into another freaking candy cane?

5325
02:54:06,570 --> 02:54:08,350
I don't know what that means.

5326
02:54:08,430 --> 02:54:09,230
It's so loud in here.

5327
02:54:09,250 --> 02:54:10,430
It is.

5328
02:54:10,450 --> 02:54:11,530
It's so loud in here.

5329
02:54:11,550 --> 02:54:16,250
How am I supposed to figure out what's going on when I can't even hear my own footsteps?

5330
02:54:16,990 --> 02:54:17,950
That's a secret.

5331
02:54:18,030 --> 02:54:19,250
We're not supposed to.

5332
02:54:19,870 --> 02:54:20,370
No!

5333
02:54:21,330 --> 02:54:22,310
What's the point?

5334
02:54:23,530 --> 02:54:26,190
Oh my gosh, we are spam crouching.

5335
02:54:26,690 --> 02:54:27,950
Whoa, what a gamer.

5336
02:54:30,570 --> 02:54:31,990
Oh, they had a crown.

5337
02:54:33,030 --> 02:54:34,010
You wanna rob me?

5338
02:54:34,250 --> 02:54:36,010
No, I took somebody's cash.

5339
02:54:36,210 --> 02:54:36,590
Ooh!

5340
02:54:36,590 --> 02:54:39,230
I got Magneto powers!

5341
02:54:40,030 --> 02:54:40,170
Yeah!

5342
02:54:40,770 --> 02:54:41,610
Where are they?

5343
02:54:41,970 --> 02:54:43,170
Throw big balls at them.

5344
02:54:43,470 --> 02:54:43,790
Where?

5345
02:54:45,430 --> 02:54:46,170
I'm ready.

5346
02:54:46,610 --> 02:54:47,790
I think they're on the other side.

5347
02:54:48,350 --> 02:54:49,730
Oh, they're over here?

5348
02:54:49,970 --> 02:54:51,890
I don't have any shields, but I'm ready.

5349
02:54:52,410 --> 02:54:53,350
Oh, I have a shield.

5350
02:54:53,410 --> 02:54:54,150
Oh wait, no, it's okay.

5351
02:54:54,210 --> 02:54:56,010
I found, I found, let it rain.

5352
02:54:56,730 --> 02:54:57,930
Let it rain.

5353
02:54:58,250 --> 02:54:59,690
Let it rain.

5354
02:54:59,690 --> 02:55:00,390
Woo!

5355
02:55:01,430 --> 02:55:02,070
Woo!

5356
02:55:04,570 --> 02:55:07,630
We are the champions.

5357
02:55:09,250 --> 02:55:10,530
We are...

5358
02:55:10,530 --> 02:55:11,170
Okay, it's done.

5359
02:55:13,930 --> 02:55:15,290
I'm gonna jump through the ring.

5360
02:55:15,810 --> 02:55:17,490
Okay, me too.

5361
02:55:18,130 --> 02:55:18,770
Woo!

5362
02:55:20,350 --> 02:55:21,170
Wait, oh.

5363
02:55:21,310 --> 02:55:22,170
It's a Christmas skin!

5364
02:55:22,410 --> 02:55:24,670
Get over here.

5365
02:55:25,030 --> 02:55:26,190
Get over here.

5366
02:55:26,430 --> 02:55:27,410
Get over here!

5367
02:55:27,790 --> 02:55:28,990
That's fucking right.

5368
02:55:29,690 --> 02:55:31,030
You're fucking on them.

5369
02:55:31,530 --> 02:55:33,910
That's fucking, don't make me pull this off.

5370
02:55:33,910 --> 02:55:34,490
How did you do that?

5371
02:55:34,870 --> 02:55:35,670
Where is he?

5372
02:55:36,070 --> 02:55:36,710
Oh, nice.

5373
02:55:36,710 --> 02:55:37,250
Oh, they're dead!

5374
02:55:38,090 --> 02:55:39,090
Oh my fucking god.

5375
02:55:39,090 --> 02:55:39,110
Nice.

5376
02:55:39,110 --> 02:55:40,090
I didn't even get shot at.

5377
02:55:40,250 --> 02:55:40,590
Nice.

5378
02:55:40,690 --> 02:55:41,350
Yo, you're insane.

5379
02:55:41,590 --> 02:55:42,130
How'd you do that?

5380
02:55:43,570 --> 02:55:44,610
Pure anger.

5381
02:55:47,070 --> 02:55:48,730
These guys aren't froze.

5382
02:55:50,810 --> 02:55:53,950
They're probably 12 year olds who are off of school now.

5383
02:55:53,950 --> 02:55:57,170
They're probably, they're probably actually kids.

5384
02:55:58,410 --> 02:55:59,270
Thank god.

5385
02:55:59,690 --> 02:56:02,450
Thank god there's actual children playing this game so I can feel something.

5386
02:56:04,530 --> 02:56:05,410
Oh, there's a ship!

5387
02:56:05,530 --> 02:56:06,370
Oh no, that's not a ship.

5388
02:56:06,530 --> 02:56:07,230
God damn it.

5389
02:56:07,470 --> 02:56:09,230
I thought that was gonna be a ship.

5390
02:56:09,510 --> 02:56:11,310
I was gonna be like, yay, it was a launch pad.

5391
02:56:11,310 --> 02:56:11,650
Yeah, you're right.

5392
02:56:11,710 --> 02:56:12,890
I haven't seen any ships.

5393
02:56:13,090 --> 02:56:13,670
Where are the ships at?

5394
02:56:14,010 --> 02:56:14,790
Yeah, me too.

5395
02:56:14,870 --> 02:56:15,510
I haven't seen any.

5396
02:56:16,070 --> 02:56:17,270
Where's that guy I killed?

5397
02:56:19,090 --> 02:56:20,450
I think, did he die above?

5398
02:56:20,750 --> 02:56:21,410
I think he killed him above.

5399
02:56:21,450 --> 02:56:22,590
Yeah, I killed him above, yes.

5400
02:56:22,850 --> 02:56:26,150
Oh shit, I put two, I put all the launch pads.

5401
02:56:26,770 --> 02:56:27,250
Pew!

5402
02:56:29,490 --> 02:56:30,710
Oh, is that bear's shotgun?

5403
02:56:30,970 --> 02:56:31,570
Oh, never mind.

5404
02:56:31,890 --> 02:56:33,050
My weapons suck.

5405
02:56:33,090 --> 02:56:33,810
Alright, warrior.

5406
02:56:35,190 --> 02:56:36,850
Is this a shotgun too?

5407
02:56:37,110 --> 02:56:37,810
It is.

5408
02:56:37,910 --> 02:56:38,150
Okay.

5409
02:56:38,890 --> 02:56:39,790
What is this?

5410
02:56:39,970 --> 02:56:40,970
Oh, shield EMP.

5411
02:56:41,110 --> 02:56:41,390
Okay.

5412
02:56:42,890 --> 02:56:43,370
Wait.

5413
02:56:43,510 --> 02:56:44,490
Oh, that's already looted.

5414
02:56:45,570 --> 02:56:46,870
You didn't spawn the boss.

5415
02:56:46,910 --> 02:56:48,310
Do you want the medallion again?

5416
02:56:48,550 --> 02:56:49,430
Nah, that's fine.

5417
02:56:49,510 --> 02:56:52,030
After what happened to me there, I'm okay.

5418
02:56:52,430 --> 02:56:53,210
I'm okay.

5419
02:56:53,950 --> 02:56:57,390
Alright, let me see if I can get her to spawn.

5420
02:56:57,650 --> 02:56:59,470
I'm gonna grab the medallion for us.

5421
02:57:02,230 --> 02:57:02,870
Oh, what?

5422
02:57:02,950 --> 02:57:04,390
I'm gonna waste this medkit.

5423
02:57:04,990 --> 02:57:06,770
Oh wait, no, there's a fucking cactus there.

5424
02:57:06,810 --> 02:57:07,210
Never mind.

5425
02:57:07,730 --> 02:57:11,210
Yeah, see, you're already learning all these things that other players don't even know yet.

5426
02:57:11,530 --> 02:57:11,970
Yeah!

5427
02:57:12,430 --> 02:57:14,190
I think everybody knows already.

5428
02:57:14,510 --> 02:57:15,710
I don't think I'm...

5429
02:57:17,570 --> 02:57:18,090
Let's see.

5430
02:57:18,230 --> 02:57:19,350
Ooh, all arounder.

5431
02:57:19,370 --> 02:57:20,150
I want that.

5432
02:57:20,670 --> 02:57:21,990
I want an all-rounder.

5433
02:57:22,150 --> 02:57:23,950
I don't want to go around the onion ring here.

5434
02:57:24,010 --> 02:57:24,590
What the hell?

5435
02:57:24,710 --> 02:57:26,050
Where's the fucking cactus?

5436
02:57:26,050 --> 02:57:26,630
Oh, there's a car here.

5437
02:57:28,030 --> 02:57:29,050
Give me that cactus.

5438
02:57:32,150 --> 02:57:33,070
Oh, what the hell?

5439
02:57:33,070 --> 02:57:33,990
Oh, there's a car there.

5440
02:57:34,450 --> 02:57:35,750
Yeah, there's a vehicle here.

5441
02:57:37,430 --> 02:57:38,370
Fucking... Get away!

5442
02:57:39,090 --> 02:57:39,670
Get away!

5443
02:57:41,550 --> 02:57:42,290
I'm with you.

5444
02:57:43,710 --> 02:57:45,150
Oh shit, we're magnealing!

5445
02:57:46,370 --> 02:57:47,170
Oh shit!

5446
02:57:47,310 --> 02:57:48,330
I might be dead though.

5447
02:57:48,570 --> 02:57:49,210
Oh, you're good, you're good.

5448
02:57:49,990 --> 02:57:51,530
Nice, nice, nice.

5449
02:57:51,630 --> 02:57:52,610
I'm getting this cactus.

5450
02:57:53,210 --> 02:57:53,850
Yeah, yeah, get the cactus.

5451
02:57:56,030 --> 02:57:56,790
Oh my god.

5452
02:57:56,810 --> 02:57:59,010
How do I float with it?

5453
02:57:59,670 --> 02:58:00,690
Oh, you gotta...

5454
02:58:00,690 --> 02:58:01,650
You have to just have it equipped.

5455
02:58:04,230 --> 02:58:04,750
No!

5456
02:58:05,610 --> 02:58:06,790
Come back here!

5457
02:58:07,050 --> 02:58:07,890
Get back here!

5458
02:58:09,150 --> 02:58:10,070
You smell!

5459
02:58:10,390 --> 02:58:10,730
Yeah!

5460
02:58:10,770 --> 02:58:11,290
Let's fucking go!

5461
02:58:11,290 --> 02:58:12,570
Get the shit on!

5462
02:58:12,890 --> 02:58:14,130
They got shit on!

5463
02:58:14,870 --> 02:58:15,390
Okay.

5464
02:58:15,570 --> 02:58:16,170
And they're fucking dead.

5465
02:58:16,550 --> 02:58:17,310
Fucking dead.

5466
02:58:17,610 --> 02:58:18,010
Yeah!

5467
02:58:18,010 --> 02:58:19,690
Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.

5468
02:58:22,290 --> 02:58:22,730
Yay!

5469
02:58:23,470 --> 02:58:24,550
Yeah, get shit on!

5470
02:58:24,570 --> 02:58:25,790
How are you dancing with it on?

5471
02:58:25,910 --> 02:58:26,350
Oh, there you go.

5472
02:58:26,470 --> 02:58:27,450
Get shit on!

5473
02:58:28,110 --> 02:58:29,290
Yeah, that's fucking right.

5474
02:58:29,930 --> 02:58:30,950
That's fucking right.

5475
02:58:31,970 --> 02:58:33,630
These guys are probably also like 12-year-olds too.

5476
02:58:33,630 --> 02:58:35,770
These guys never fucking fought real pro players.

5477
02:58:37,450 --> 02:58:37,890
What?

5478
02:58:37,890 --> 02:58:38,750
Oh, what's that?

5479
02:58:39,270 --> 02:58:40,110
Wait, no, never mind.

5480
02:58:40,170 --> 02:58:41,310
I thought that was the ship.

5481
02:58:41,690 --> 02:58:42,390
I think it's treasure.

5482
02:58:42,630 --> 02:58:43,550
No, that's the buried treasure.

5483
02:58:44,190 --> 02:58:44,850
Oh, let's see.

5484
02:58:44,890 --> 02:58:45,330
Where does it go to?

5485
02:58:45,470 --> 02:58:46,950
Oh, it's so far.

5486
02:58:47,130 --> 02:58:47,710
I don't want to go to that.

5487
02:58:47,850 --> 02:58:49,130
Yeah, that's why it got thrown away.

5488
02:58:50,370 --> 02:58:52,270
That's why children are so toxic.

5489
02:58:52,370 --> 02:58:55,030
They need to learn about the real world.

5490
02:58:55,650 --> 02:58:56,010
They need to learn about the real world.

5491
02:58:56,010 --> 02:58:56,030
Yeah.

5492
02:58:56,030 --> 02:58:57,890
Their hopes and spirits have to be crushed.

5493
02:58:59,690 --> 02:59:00,050
Eventually.

5494
02:59:02,910 --> 02:59:04,010
Like, you're welcome.

5495
02:59:04,150 --> 02:59:06,370
I wish my spirits were crushed when I was a child.

5496
02:59:07,190 --> 02:59:07,770
I wish my spirits were crushed when I was a child.

5497
02:59:07,770 --> 02:59:08,370
That's what I'm saying!

5498
02:59:08,490 --> 02:59:12,570
If you don't get crushed as a child, you're gonna get crushed at some point.

5499
02:59:12,790 --> 02:59:12,790
Yeah.

5500
02:59:13,070 --> 02:59:13,510
If you don't get crushed as a child, you're gonna get crushed at some point.

5501
02:59:13,550 --> 02:59:15,270
If you don't get crushed as a child, you're gonna get crushed at some point.

5502
02:59:15,270 --> 02:59:16,230
Then I know.

5503
02:59:16,350 --> 02:59:18,550
I know I'm not special.

5504
02:59:19,030 --> 02:59:19,510
Then I know.

5505
02:59:19,510 --> 02:59:19,510
I know I'm not special.

5506
02:59:19,510 --> 02:59:20,530
They need to know they're not special.

5507
02:59:25,050 --> 02:59:26,830
Yeah, let them know while they're young.

5508
02:59:27,110 --> 02:59:27,890
Yeah, exactly.

5509
02:59:28,510 --> 02:59:31,190
Fucking living that delusion when your parents are like, you're special.

5510
02:59:31,430 --> 02:59:32,610
Not everybody's special.

5511
02:59:33,170 --> 02:59:34,370
Especially you, child.

5512
02:59:36,150 --> 02:59:38,070
Oh, I knocked her down there.

5513
02:59:40,230 --> 02:59:41,070
It's the boss lady.

5514
02:59:41,570 --> 02:59:42,350
Where is she?

5515
02:59:43,550 --> 02:59:43,630
There she is.

5516
02:59:45,630 --> 02:59:46,110
Boom!

5517
02:59:47,270 --> 02:59:47,750
Boom!

5518
02:59:49,570 --> 02:59:50,910
Oh shit, I'm floating.

5519
02:59:51,050 --> 02:59:51,770
Get shit on, nerd!

5520
02:59:53,470 --> 02:59:53,950
Boom!

5521
02:59:55,010 --> 02:59:56,010
That's fucking right.

5522
02:59:57,290 --> 02:59:58,330
Wait, I'm getting shot.

5523
02:59:58,490 --> 03:00:00,270
I'm getting shot by real people!

5524
03:00:00,730 --> 03:00:01,490
Real people!

5525
03:00:02,390 --> 03:00:03,590
Oh, is that AI?

5526
03:00:06,070 --> 03:00:07,030
Oh, sorry.

5527
03:00:07,090 --> 03:00:07,630
I couldn't tell.

5528
03:00:07,970 --> 03:00:09,310
I can't tell these days.

5529
03:00:09,710 --> 03:00:10,930
What's real and what's not.

5530
03:00:11,230 --> 03:00:12,610
They all look the same.

5531
03:00:13,550 --> 03:00:14,790
You're all AI to me!

5532
03:00:14,910 --> 03:00:16,010
You're all AI!

5533
03:00:18,210 --> 03:00:18,690
Wait,

5534
03:00:21,970 --> 03:00:22,590
what the hell is this?

5535
03:00:23,170 --> 03:00:24,150
Let it rain!

5536
03:00:25,050 --> 03:00:26,310
Let it rain!

5537
03:00:26,310 --> 03:00:27,890
Let it rain on me!

5538
03:00:29,510 --> 03:00:31,870
Let the rain fall down!

5539
03:00:32,190 --> 03:00:32,430
Let the rain fall down!

5540
03:00:32,470 --> 03:00:33,850
Oh, you wanna get the boss car?

5541
03:00:34,010 --> 03:00:35,430
Oh, there's a boss?

5542
03:00:35,550 --> 03:00:37,050
Is that the car that like...

5543
03:00:37,050 --> 03:00:38,650
The one that destroys everyone?

5544
03:00:38,990 --> 03:00:40,290
Yeah, the one where they...

5545
03:00:40,290 --> 03:00:44,270
Yeah, the one that they destroyed everybody with and got cars back.

5546
03:00:44,270 --> 03:00:46,510
You're gonna literally be the best gunner in this thing.

5547
03:00:46,730 --> 03:00:48,630
Oh my gosh, the one where...

5548
03:00:48,630 --> 03:00:50,170
Alright, no, that wasn't it.

5549
03:00:50,550 --> 03:00:52,470
Oh, they must have modded it then.

5550
03:00:52,550 --> 03:00:53,450
Yeah, they had a different one.

5551
03:00:53,550 --> 03:00:53,810
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5552
03:00:56,110 --> 03:00:57,610
Go fuck shit up!

5553
03:00:57,990 --> 03:00:59,530
Yeah, let's go fuck shit up.

5554
03:01:00,050 --> 03:01:01,630
Let's ruin these people's time.

5555
03:01:01,630 --> 03:01:02,310
Look at these guys here.

5556
03:01:02,530 --> 03:01:03,250
Look at these dudes.

5557
03:01:05,430 --> 03:01:07,730
Yeah, they tried you.

5558
03:01:09,290 --> 03:01:10,370
That's fucking right.

5559
03:01:10,410 --> 03:01:12,430
You think like this is gonna help you?

5560
03:01:12,790 --> 03:01:14,010
Wait, what the fuck?

5561
03:01:14,050 --> 03:01:15,210
What did we get hit by?

5562
03:01:16,110 --> 03:01:17,130
Oh, there they are.

5563
03:01:19,710 --> 03:01:21,930
Oh my god, they both have fists?

5564
03:01:22,030 --> 03:01:23,310
Fucking nerds.

5565
03:01:24,550 --> 03:01:26,650
You think your movement is cute?

5566
03:01:27,470 --> 03:01:28,450
Where did they go?

5567
03:01:29,510 --> 03:01:30,610
Where did they go?

5568
03:01:32,110 --> 03:01:33,490
I think they're over here.

5569
03:01:33,490 --> 03:01:34,070
Wait, wait.

5570
03:01:36,090 --> 03:01:36,570
What?

5571
03:01:38,010 --> 03:01:39,150
They're in the trees?

5572
03:01:41,830 --> 03:01:44,010
You think I care about your trees?

5573
03:01:46,030 --> 03:01:47,590
Where did they go?

5574
03:01:48,150 --> 03:01:49,290
They're like over here.

5575
03:01:49,730 --> 03:01:51,110
Are they in another tree?

5576
03:01:52,250 --> 03:01:54,070
They're literally in another tree.

5577
03:01:54,590 --> 03:01:55,150
Oh, there's a guy over here.

5578
03:01:55,270 --> 03:01:57,630
I see him.

5579
03:01:59,610 --> 03:02:01,430
Bro, what the fuck?

5580
03:02:03,510 --> 03:02:06,150
It's so hard to aim with this.

5581
03:02:08,790 --> 03:02:09,610
Where is he?

5582
03:02:10,090 --> 03:02:10,970
I see you.

5583
03:02:11,290 --> 03:02:13,930
You don't have the fists forever.

5584
03:02:15,650 --> 03:02:16,430
Oh my god.

5585
03:02:16,450 --> 03:02:17,190
Okay, maybe you do.

5586
03:02:18,370 --> 03:02:19,570
Maybe you do.

5587
03:02:19,670 --> 03:02:21,070
They just keep fisting away.

5588
03:02:22,810 --> 03:02:23,670
Wait, they rez?

5589
03:02:24,010 --> 03:02:24,790
They rez?

5590
03:02:25,270 --> 03:02:26,590
I think someone just rez, yeah.

5591
03:02:27,010 --> 03:02:27,470
Where?

5592
03:02:27,770 --> 03:02:29,670
I think, like right next to us.

5593
03:02:29,850 --> 03:02:30,670
Wait, why is it pink?

5594
03:02:32,010 --> 03:02:32,750
Yeah, you see that?

5595
03:02:32,750 --> 03:02:33,410
Oh, there he is, yeah.

5596
03:02:36,470 --> 03:02:37,690
Is that Ariana Grande?

5597
03:02:37,830 --> 03:02:37,870
Everybody has fists?

5598
03:02:38,070 --> 03:02:39,030
What's wrong with you?

5599
03:02:42,610 --> 03:02:44,110
Get back here, Ariana Grande.

5600
03:02:44,430 --> 03:02:45,330
Just fucking run her over.

5601
03:02:45,330 --> 03:02:46,350
Just fucking run her over.

5602
03:02:46,410 --> 03:02:46,730
Fuck this.

5603
03:02:51,690 --> 03:02:53,210
Just run her over.

5604
03:02:53,350 --> 03:02:53,870
Fucking nerds.

5605
03:02:53,870 --> 03:02:55,070
Fucking nerds.

5606
03:02:56,350 --> 03:02:58,270
Oh my god, shoot a gun.

5607
03:03:01,050 --> 03:03:02,010
Welcome to Fortnite.

5608
03:03:02,150 --> 03:03:04,430
Shoot a fucking real gun.

5609
03:03:05,290 --> 03:03:06,770
This is not melee.

5610
03:03:07,790 --> 03:03:09,070
Go to Evo.

5611
03:03:09,090 --> 03:03:10,650
Evo is literally right now.

5612
03:03:10,730 --> 03:03:11,910
Go to fucking Evo.

5613
03:03:12,370 --> 03:03:15,490
They're all just running and not shooting their weapons.

5614
03:03:15,790 --> 03:03:16,130
They're all just running and not shooting their weapons.

5615
03:03:16,130 --> 03:03:16,150
Yeah.

5616
03:03:19,030 --> 03:03:19,550
Wait.

5617
03:03:20,250 --> 03:03:21,670
I think they're fighting over here.

5618
03:03:21,710 --> 03:03:22,610
There's so much death here.

5619
03:03:22,610 --> 03:03:24,470
Oh my god, there's so many dead bodies, yeah.

5620
03:03:25,610 --> 03:03:26,790
Oh wait, are they on the ship?

5621
03:03:28,270 --> 03:03:28,850
No, they're not.

5622
03:03:29,250 --> 03:03:30,290
Let's go chase that one.

5623
03:03:32,730 --> 03:03:33,890
That's an NPC, right?

5624
03:03:34,330 --> 03:03:34,510
Yeah.

5625
03:03:34,890 --> 03:03:36,170
Oh, that's Barbossa.

5626
03:03:36,970 --> 03:03:38,090
Oh, Barbossa!

5627
03:03:39,870 --> 03:03:40,430
Barbossa!

5628
03:03:42,810 --> 03:03:43,370
Barbossa!

5629
03:03:45,170 --> 03:03:47,410
Why are you bringing a sword to a gunfight?

5630
03:03:47,590 --> 03:03:49,150
Yeah, you fucking bitch.

5631
03:03:49,410 --> 03:03:50,030
Fucking idiot.

5632
03:03:52,230 --> 03:03:53,550
Barbossa can fly.

5633
03:03:54,470 --> 03:03:55,970
Yeah, I get shit on Barbossa.

5634
03:03:56,110 --> 03:03:56,430
Yeah.

5635
03:03:58,270 --> 03:03:58,950
Where the fuck are people?

5636
03:03:59,010 --> 03:04:00,230
There's still 17 people left.

5637
03:04:00,410 --> 03:04:02,230
How is the game not ended yet?

5638
03:04:02,310 --> 03:04:04,870
How is game 6 not ready?

5639
03:04:05,290 --> 03:04:07,510
They're probably close to the last zone.

5640
03:04:08,330 --> 03:04:09,370
Oh my god.

5641
03:04:09,410 --> 03:04:10,290
Maybe another few minutes?

5642
03:04:11,750 --> 03:04:12,270
Oh!

5643
03:04:13,990 --> 03:04:15,130
Wait, I can see.

5644
03:04:15,230 --> 03:04:16,030
Wait, wait, wait.

5645
03:04:16,710 --> 03:04:18,350
I'm gonna tap out real quick.

5646
03:04:18,630 --> 03:04:18,970
Oh god.

5647
03:04:19,430 --> 03:04:21,830
Yeah, they're literally still on last zone.

5648
03:04:22,030 --> 03:04:23,890
Oh my god, they're still going?

5649
03:04:23,890 --> 03:04:25,690
Jesus Christ.

5650
03:04:25,810 --> 03:04:26,790
They're literally going.

5651
03:04:27,930 --> 03:04:28,450
Alright.

5652
03:04:28,550 --> 03:04:31,070
The longest Fortnite match ever.

5653
03:04:31,210 --> 03:04:32,350
Where are they?

5654
03:04:33,310 --> 03:04:35,430
Oh, they have the magneto gloves!

5655
03:04:36,370 --> 03:04:37,190
Oh, wait.

5656
03:04:37,270 --> 03:04:37,950
What is he doing?

5657
03:04:39,110 --> 03:04:40,850
Are they gonna magneto glove us?

5658
03:04:40,870 --> 03:04:41,130
Yup.

5659
03:04:41,330 --> 03:04:41,830
Oh, they are.

5660
03:04:41,970 --> 03:04:42,350
Oh!

5661
03:04:43,410 --> 03:04:43,930
Shit!

5662
03:04:44,850 --> 03:04:47,390
Wait, they're so good with this!

5663
03:04:48,950 --> 03:04:49,830
Where are they?

5664
03:04:50,810 --> 03:04:51,330
Oh!

5665
03:04:52,370 --> 03:04:53,370
Bro, he's...

5666
03:04:53,890 --> 03:04:55,050
He's different!

5667
03:04:55,970 --> 03:04:56,710
He's different!

5668
03:05:00,170 --> 03:05:01,770
Oh my god, this guy's a gamer.

5669
03:05:01,850 --> 03:05:02,970
Oh, of course they have the freaking...

5670
03:05:02,970 --> 03:05:04,730
They have the medallion or whatever.

5671
03:05:05,050 --> 03:05:06,030
Wait, the medallion?

5672
03:05:07,890 --> 03:05:09,330
Keep throwing game, please!

5673
03:05:09,450 --> 03:05:10,630
Oh my god, I'm dead.

5674
03:05:10,750 --> 03:05:12,090
What medallion do they have?

5675
03:05:12,670 --> 03:05:14,310
They have the infinite nitro one.

5676
03:05:16,250 --> 03:05:18,410
It's always the one that I die to.

5677
03:05:18,550 --> 03:05:19,350
All the time.

5678
03:05:20,430 --> 03:05:21,930
Bro, that guy...

5679
03:05:21,930 --> 03:05:23,410
That guy's been playing Fortnite for a while.

5680
03:05:23,890 --> 03:05:24,090
I can tell.

5681
03:05:25,250 --> 03:05:30,350
Literally fucking hitting me hitting me with magneto style.

5682
03:05:30,710 --> 03:05:31,470
That shit was crazy.

5683
03:05:32,590 --> 03:05:34,210
That shit was actually crazy.

5684
03:05:35,650 --> 03:05:36,530
I think...

5685
03:05:36,530 --> 03:05:36,770
I think...

5686
03:05:37,470 --> 03:05:39,410
He's on your body right now.

5687
03:05:39,530 --> 03:05:40,910
Oh, I forgot I have this freaking...

5688
03:05:40,910 --> 03:05:42,170
Oh, the medallion.

5689
03:05:42,410 --> 03:05:43,830
Oh, you also have the medallion, don't you?

5690
03:05:44,030 --> 03:05:46,270
Yeah, I have the medallion, so they're probably just gonna keep chasing me.

5691
03:05:48,290 --> 03:05:48,730
Unless...

5692
03:05:50,510 --> 03:05:50,950
Unless...

5693
03:05:53,430 --> 03:05:53,870
Unless...

5694
03:05:53,870 --> 03:05:54,810
Like, we're good.

5695
03:05:55,050 --> 03:05:55,790
We're good.

5696
03:05:56,090 --> 03:05:57,130
I can heal.

5697
03:05:57,410 --> 03:05:57,970
Oh, nice.

5698
03:05:58,490 --> 03:05:59,570
Wait, they're like down here.

5699
03:05:59,790 --> 03:06:00,590
Maybe I'll get your card.

5700
03:06:03,790 --> 03:06:06,950
Guys, we're not gonna miss game 6 because they're literally still playing.

5701
03:06:08,130 --> 03:06:09,670
They've been playing for 20 years.

5702
03:06:10,030 --> 03:06:10,950
Ew, look at this guy.

5703
03:06:15,840 --> 03:06:17,080
What the fuck?

5704
03:06:17,180 --> 03:06:17,800
You're dead.

5705
03:06:20,960 --> 03:06:22,260
Oh my god.

5706
03:06:22,640 --> 03:06:25,160
I think they might run to you after that.

5707
03:06:25,160 --> 03:06:26,320
What is happening?

5708
03:06:30,470 --> 03:06:31,470
I don't even care.

5709
03:06:31,490 --> 03:06:32,050
I have to die.

5710
03:06:32,090 --> 03:06:32,970
What the fuck is this movement?

5711
03:06:33,890 --> 03:06:34,590
Don't die.

5712
03:06:34,650 --> 03:06:36,390
Game 6 is still not starting.

5713
03:06:36,810 --> 03:06:37,690
Oh shit, really?

5714
03:06:37,750 --> 03:06:38,930
You gotta be alive.

5715
03:06:39,870 --> 03:06:40,850
Oh wait, I see him.

5716
03:06:41,490 --> 03:06:41,970
Game?

5717
03:06:42,170 --> 03:06:43,150
Can you like, do the thing?

5718
03:06:45,450 --> 03:06:47,150
Oh my god, you're crazy.

5719
03:06:47,710 --> 03:06:49,090
You're so dead for that.

5720
03:06:49,610 --> 03:06:50,490
I'm so dead?

5721
03:06:50,770 --> 03:06:51,550
Oh, they're running.

5722
03:06:53,050 --> 03:06:53,670
Kill him.

5723
03:06:53,750 --> 03:06:54,410
At least...

5724
03:06:54,410 --> 03:06:55,630
At least kill him.

5725
03:06:55,710 --> 03:06:56,630
That's all I care.

5726
03:06:58,450 --> 03:06:59,330
Yeah, he's dead.

5727
03:06:59,530 --> 03:07:00,270
Fuck you.

5728
03:07:02,470 --> 03:07:03,550
Wait, you can grab my card.

5729
03:07:03,570 --> 03:07:04,250
Okay, I guess not.

5730
03:07:04,550 --> 03:07:06,490
Oh, you should not grab my card.

5731
03:07:06,730 --> 03:07:07,790
Nah, we live this.

5732
03:07:08,450 --> 03:07:10,890
You have practice living.

5733
03:07:11,550 --> 03:07:12,810
Practice for game 6.

5734
03:07:15,990 --> 03:07:18,110
You have practice for game 6.

5735
03:07:20,570 --> 03:07:22,090
Oh my god, he's so mad.

5736
03:07:22,490 --> 03:07:24,050
Wait, is he still chasing you?

5737
03:07:24,210 --> 03:07:26,090
Holy shit.

5738
03:07:26,190 --> 03:07:26,770
Thank you.

5739
03:07:30,330 --> 03:07:31,070
Oh my god.

5740
03:07:31,110 --> 03:07:31,190
Oh my god.

5741
03:07:31,190 --> 03:07:31,650
Wait, where did he go?

5742
03:07:31,770 --> 03:07:32,250
He's gone.

5743
03:07:32,450 --> 03:07:32,950
Oh, he stopped.

5744
03:07:32,990 --> 03:07:33,210
He stopped.

5745
03:07:34,650 --> 03:07:35,770
Oh my god.

5746
03:07:36,070 --> 03:07:38,770
Guys, this is how... what's happening.

5747
03:07:39,050 --> 03:07:43,910
Guys, this is like, basically how Fortnite is supposed to be played apparently now.

5748
03:07:46,830 --> 03:07:49,630
It's not about you using your guns anymore.

5749
03:07:50,050 --> 03:07:51,210
No, what's with your gun?

5750
03:07:51,250 --> 03:07:52,290
That's so like, last year.

5751
03:07:52,310 --> 03:07:54,730
Yeah, like, who the fuck shoots their guns?

5752
03:07:57,650 --> 03:07:58,790
Do you want me to revive you?

5753
03:07:58,830 --> 03:07:59,790
Oh, I didn't even get your card.

5754
03:07:59,910 --> 03:08:01,410
No, it's fine.

5755
03:08:02,070 --> 03:08:04,170
I need you to practice the solo runs.

5756
03:08:05,050 --> 03:08:05,470
No!

5757
03:08:06,530 --> 03:08:10,390
Dorio, you need to do this for pho.

5758
03:08:10,670 --> 03:08:12,450
I need to eat pho.

5759
03:08:12,790 --> 03:08:14,970
Okay, the pho is gonna be my one thing.

5760
03:08:15,450 --> 03:08:19,110
Dorio, if we are not above Jay, I'm not getting pho.

5761
03:08:20,330 --> 03:08:20,990
Dorio, if we are not above Jay, I'm not getting pho.

5762
03:08:22,150 --> 03:08:23,530
No, don't tell me that.

5763
03:08:23,550 --> 03:08:24,930
I'm not getting pho.

5764
03:08:25,750 --> 03:08:26,990
I'm working for the pho.

5765
03:08:26,990 --> 03:08:27,650
We're doing it.

5766
03:08:30,710 --> 03:08:31,870
I'm gonna go for that guy.

5767
03:08:32,870 --> 03:08:33,450
Which one?

5768
03:08:34,150 --> 03:08:35,410
The dude who killed you.

5769
03:08:35,610 --> 03:08:36,290
Oh shit, yeah.

5770
03:08:38,250 --> 03:08:39,050
Wait, oh?

5771
03:08:39,470 --> 03:08:42,570
Yeah, game 5 is over, but we haven't got the code yet.

5772
03:08:42,630 --> 03:08:43,590
We're just waiting for the code.

5773
03:08:44,890 --> 03:08:45,550
Holy shit.

5774
03:08:45,570 --> 03:08:50,170
They should be able to respawn their buddy though.

5775
03:08:50,570 --> 03:08:50,610
They should be able to respawn their buddy though.

5776
03:08:51,070 --> 03:08:52,330
Yeah, there he is.

5777
03:08:52,810 --> 03:08:53,710
There's orange kid.

5778
03:08:55,890 --> 03:08:57,530
I think he went to get his buddy too.

5779
03:08:58,250 --> 03:08:58,850
Did he?

5780
03:08:58,910 --> 03:09:00,290
I don't think he got him yet, did he?

5781
03:09:01,730 --> 03:09:03,890
Well, they've been there for a while now.

5782
03:09:04,050 --> 03:09:04,690
Oh, there he is.

5783
03:09:04,850 --> 03:09:05,650
There he is again.

5784
03:09:05,750 --> 03:09:06,350
What's this guy doing?

5785
03:09:07,950 --> 03:09:09,790
You have unlimited nitro, dude.

5786
03:09:13,810 --> 03:09:14,210
Whoa.

5787
03:09:14,710 --> 03:09:16,190
I don't think, did he res them?

5788
03:09:16,950 --> 03:09:17,670
I don't know.

5789
03:09:18,450 --> 03:09:18,850
I don't know.

5790
03:09:21,110 --> 03:09:22,690
I mean, there's still the res car.

5791
03:09:22,930 --> 03:09:23,630
I mean, there's still the res car.

5792
03:09:24,110 --> 03:09:25,110
He could be here if he res.

5793
03:09:25,170 --> 03:09:26,230
Oh my god, they're here?

5794
03:09:27,950 --> 03:09:28,550
Oh.

5795
03:09:29,470 --> 03:09:31,430
What the fuck is going on?

5796
03:09:33,250 --> 03:09:34,690
Why do I...

5797
03:09:34,690 --> 03:09:36,930
I don't even know what Fortnite is anymore.

5798
03:09:37,170 --> 03:09:37,970
Oh my god.

5799
03:09:39,150 --> 03:09:42,490
This guy is just running the whole time.

5800
03:09:44,290 --> 03:09:46,230
Magneto versus Magneto.

5801
03:09:48,870 --> 03:09:50,310
I don't get pushed in the back.

5802
03:09:51,010 --> 03:09:52,730
Oh, the other medallions are...

5803
03:09:52,730 --> 03:09:53,210
Oh shit.

5804
03:09:53,870 --> 03:09:54,990
Oh, I'm gone.

5805
03:09:55,010 --> 03:09:56,510
Well, they know you're a medallion too.

5806
03:09:57,430 --> 03:09:59,550
This is a Dragon Ball Z battle.

5807
03:09:59,650 --> 03:10:00,050
It is.

5808
03:10:00,370 --> 03:10:03,330
This is why nobody takes Fortnite competitive seriously anymore.

5809
03:10:03,850 --> 03:10:06,230
This is why I definitely do not play competitively.

5810
03:10:08,210 --> 03:10:11,390
The thing is, Battle Royale is already really difficult.

5811
03:10:11,610 --> 03:10:12,670
Because of RNG.

5812
03:10:13,590 --> 03:10:16,550
And then you factor in all these ridiculous mechanics.

5813
03:10:17,310 --> 03:10:17,710
And then you factor in all these ridiculous mechanics.

5814
03:10:17,710 --> 03:10:20,290
It's so hard to balance competitively.

5815
03:10:20,310 --> 03:10:21,630
For Battle Royale.

5816
03:10:21,730 --> 03:10:23,090
Because it's just full on RNG.

5817
03:10:23,650 --> 03:10:25,130
On who has the better loot.

5818
03:10:25,610 --> 03:10:27,290
Fortnite is so...

5819
03:10:27,290 --> 03:10:29,490
It also has a very bad tick rate.

5820
03:10:30,110 --> 03:10:32,370
Because the netcode is really bad.

5821
03:10:33,590 --> 03:10:35,490
And then you factor in build mode.

5822
03:10:35,830 --> 03:10:36,210
Yeah.

5823
03:10:36,530 --> 03:10:38,250
And it's just extra bad.

5824
03:10:40,750 --> 03:10:41,990
Oh, is he going to give you stuff?

5825
03:10:42,250 --> 03:10:43,490
Oh, yes he is.

5826
03:10:43,850 --> 03:10:44,090
Yeah!

5827
03:10:44,670 --> 03:10:45,950
Oh, and you got... whoa!

5828
03:10:46,890 --> 03:10:47,810
I got stuff.

5829
03:10:47,970 --> 03:10:48,430
Okay, we're good.

5830
03:10:48,550 --> 03:10:48,710
We're good.

5831
03:10:48,770 --> 03:10:48,870
We're good.

5832
03:10:50,310 --> 03:10:50,450
Yeah.

5833
03:10:50,590 --> 03:10:52,390
Are they fighting?

5834
03:10:53,790 --> 03:10:54,890
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5835
03:10:54,950 --> 03:10:55,490
Free reboot.

5836
03:10:58,730 --> 03:11:00,390
I think they're going to come over here in a sec.

5837
03:11:01,710 --> 03:11:02,090
Oh!

5838
03:11:03,670 --> 03:11:04,550
Wait, someone died.

5839
03:11:04,870 --> 03:11:06,430
Oh yeah, they change the rules all the time.

5840
03:11:06,570 --> 03:11:07,370
Yeah, I agree.

5841
03:11:07,510 --> 03:11:10,390
Oh, that confession guy is the one that killed me.

5842
03:11:11,050 --> 03:11:12,390
Oh, the confession guy?

5843
03:11:12,570 --> 03:11:13,010
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5844
03:11:13,010 --> 03:11:13,350
That's him.

5845
03:11:14,310 --> 03:11:15,990
That's the purple... the orange shirt guy.

5846
03:11:18,070 --> 03:11:19,110
Wait, are they on you?

5847
03:11:20,310 --> 03:11:20,450
Yeah.

5848
03:11:21,110 --> 03:11:24,210
I'm pretty sure I got shot by those... by somebody there.

5849
03:11:26,650 --> 03:11:27,370
Heading to you.

5850
03:11:28,650 --> 03:11:29,670
Wait, this guy is dead.

5851
03:11:30,030 --> 03:11:32,190
Oh, that's not confession though.

5852
03:11:36,890 --> 03:11:37,330
Oh!

5853
03:11:39,830 --> 03:11:40,790
Oh my god!

5854
03:11:42,830 --> 03:11:43,590
What's going on?

5855
03:11:43,590 --> 03:11:44,150
What's going on?

5856
03:11:44,170 --> 03:11:44,910
What happened in there?

5857
03:11:44,930 --> 03:11:45,370
What's going on?

5858
03:11:45,630 --> 03:11:45,810
I knocked on there.

5859
03:11:45,830 --> 03:11:46,210
I knocked on there.

5860
03:11:47,930 --> 03:11:48,370
Boom!

5861
03:11:48,590 --> 03:11:48,850
Boom!

5862
03:11:48,850 --> 03:11:49,570
No!

5863
03:11:50,490 --> 03:11:51,670
Wait, did I kill him?

5864
03:11:52,010 --> 03:11:53,870
I killed someone inside there.

5865
03:11:54,070 --> 03:11:55,730
Oh, wait, there's a different team.

5866
03:11:56,850 --> 03:11:57,310
What?

5867
03:11:57,430 --> 03:11:59,310
I smashed them too!

5868
03:12:00,870 --> 03:12:02,150
What do you mean?

5869
03:12:03,170 --> 03:12:05,150
I punched so much!

5870
03:12:09,150 --> 03:12:11,870
All I did was punch!

5871
03:12:12,110 --> 03:12:14,130
How did he live through that?

5872
03:12:15,450 --> 03:12:17,830
Oh, I got 180'd by a shotgun.

5873
03:12:20,150 --> 03:12:20,590
RIP.

5874
03:12:21,450 --> 03:12:22,570
He headshot me.

5875
03:12:22,610 --> 03:12:24,110
That makes sense actually.

5876
03:12:24,250 --> 03:12:25,130
You got fortnited.

5877
03:12:25,530 --> 03:12:27,430
I got fortnited, that's for sure.

5878
03:12:27,490 --> 03:12:29,290
I definitely got fortnited.

5879
03:12:30,190 --> 03:12:32,170
So now we're on the last match, right?

5880
03:12:32,390 --> 03:12:32,650
Yeah, yeah.

5881
03:12:32,810 --> 03:12:35,390
They banned SMGs and pistols.

5882
03:12:35,650 --> 03:12:37,930
Yeah, every pistol SMG is banned now.

5883
03:12:38,330 --> 03:12:38,910
Wait, what?

5884
03:12:39,130 --> 03:12:39,610
Oh, okay.

5885
03:12:39,790 --> 03:12:40,330
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5886
03:12:41,010 --> 03:12:42,250
Oh, I see the rules, yeah.

5887
03:12:42,250 --> 03:12:43,610
Okay, we got lobby code too.

5888
03:12:45,750 --> 03:12:47,210
Okay, I'm gonna enter the code.

5889
03:12:51,120 --> 03:12:51,660
Alright.

5890
03:12:51,740 --> 03:12:52,560
I got the code entered.

5891
03:12:52,900 --> 03:12:55,220
I'm playing the very first skin I ever bought.

5892
03:12:56,360 --> 03:12:59,180
What if I want to be a candy king too?

5893
03:12:59,780 --> 03:13:00,320
What if I want to be a candy king too?

5894
03:13:00,320 --> 03:13:00,340
No.

5895
03:13:00,740 --> 03:13:02,800
We need your main.

5896
03:13:03,740 --> 03:13:05,000
We need your main.

5897
03:13:05,320 --> 03:13:08,500
I play my very first skin and you play your...

5898
03:13:08,500 --> 03:13:09,920
We need good luck.

5899
03:13:10,480 --> 03:13:11,820
We need good luck.

5900
03:13:12,140 --> 03:13:13,040
Good luck everybody.

5901
03:13:14,380 --> 03:13:14,920
Good luck.

5902
03:13:15,100 --> 03:13:15,760
Good luck.

5903
03:13:16,080 --> 03:13:17,760
Please, we need it guys.

5904
03:13:18,340 --> 03:13:19,500
Give us your energy.

5905
03:13:21,040 --> 03:13:22,700
Raise your hand up chat.

5906
03:13:23,080 --> 03:13:24,000
For Faw.

5907
03:13:26,440 --> 03:13:28,000
Yeah, this is Faw on the line.

5908
03:13:28,240 --> 03:13:29,220
Guys, Faw.

5909
03:13:29,260 --> 03:13:30,720
Oh my god, John Wick is in the store.

5910
03:13:31,420 --> 03:13:32,540
Wait, John Wick's in the store?

5911
03:13:32,840 --> 03:13:34,600
Oh my god.

5912
03:13:34,860 --> 03:13:36,500
I need to get John Wick, okay.

5913
03:13:36,940 --> 03:13:38,700
I completely forgot they refreshed the store.

5914
03:13:38,820 --> 03:13:39,180
Oh my god.

5915
03:13:40,120 --> 03:13:42,060
Oh, they got the creepy alien guy.

5916
03:13:42,600 --> 03:13:43,720
Creepy alien guy?

5917
03:13:43,920 --> 03:13:44,200
What?

5918
03:13:44,600 --> 03:13:46,440
Yeah, Zorgaton?

5919
03:13:46,760 --> 03:13:48,100
Wait, I don't think I have that.

5920
03:13:48,640 --> 03:13:49,040
Zorgaton?

5921
03:13:49,220 --> 03:13:50,580
I don't even know how to say his name.

5922
03:13:50,680 --> 03:13:51,180
I think it's like...

5923
03:13:53,040 --> 03:13:54,820
I think it's like for you only.

5924
03:13:55,780 --> 03:13:57,240
Oh no, I see it, I see it.

5925
03:13:57,500 --> 03:13:58,600
Leviathan and Zorgaton.

5926
03:13:59,000 --> 03:14:00,320
Oh yeah, the ugly guys.

5927
03:14:00,840 --> 03:14:01,920
Yeah, the ugly dudes.

5928
03:14:03,120 --> 03:14:05,560
Alright, I gotta buy John Wick.

5929
03:14:05,680 --> 03:14:06,700
Fuck, I don't have V-Bucks.

5930
03:14:06,700 --> 03:14:07,500
God damn it.

5931
03:14:08,020 --> 03:14:09,100
Okay, how many players?

5932
03:14:09,160 --> 03:14:09,440
36.

5933
03:14:09,620 --> 03:14:10,540
Okay, I can spend money.

5934
03:14:10,680 --> 03:14:11,060
No, we're good.

5935
03:14:11,200 --> 03:14:11,820
You can definitely get it.

5936
03:14:14,940 --> 03:14:17,120
Yeah, give me a sec, guys.

5937
03:14:17,220 --> 03:14:19,100
I'm not gonna be...

5938
03:14:19,100 --> 03:14:20,860
I'm gonna be John Wick instead of my first skin.

5939
03:14:20,940 --> 03:14:21,720
This is much more important.

5940
03:14:21,960 --> 03:14:26,120
This is much more important, guys.

5941
03:14:27,420 --> 03:14:28,180
Okay, purchase.

5942
03:14:28,920 --> 03:14:29,320
Yay!

5943
03:14:30,820 --> 03:14:33,540
Oh, loading my order?

5944
03:14:34,260 --> 03:14:35,300
Did you get it?

5945
03:14:36,700 --> 03:14:37,440
I got epic rewards.

5946
03:14:38,120 --> 03:14:38,920
And then...

5947
03:14:40,520 --> 03:14:41,780
I'm paying for it?

5948
03:14:42,700 --> 03:14:43,360
Place order?

5949
03:14:44,480 --> 03:14:46,180
I need to log into my Paypal.

5950
03:14:46,300 --> 03:14:47,240
Give me a sec, guys.

5951
03:14:47,340 --> 03:14:48,000
This is very...

5952
03:14:48,000 --> 03:14:48,940
Guys, you don't understand.

5953
03:14:49,300 --> 03:14:50,520
Oh my god, did you so...

5954
03:14:50,520 --> 03:14:51,680
Guys, I can't buy it yet.

5955
03:14:51,720 --> 03:14:52,000
Sorry.

5956
03:14:52,700 --> 03:14:53,780
You can't get it?

5957
03:14:54,200 --> 03:14:55,540
Cause I have to order for...

5958
03:14:55,540 --> 03:14:57,760
I don't remember my Paypal login right now.

5959
03:14:57,980 --> 03:14:58,760
I'm too lazy.

5960
03:15:00,840 --> 03:15:02,720
I would gift it to you, but like...

5961
03:15:02,720 --> 03:15:05,560
I can't gift it to you unless we're friends for two days.

5962
03:15:05,900 --> 03:15:06,540
We have to be friends.

5963
03:15:06,700 --> 03:15:07,720
Two more days?

5964
03:15:08,240 --> 03:15:10,100
No, it's like one more day, but like...

5965
03:15:10,100 --> 03:15:10,740
One more day?

5966
03:15:11,320 --> 03:15:14,640
Yeah, it's two days until you can actually give someone something.

5967
03:15:14,660 --> 03:15:15,820
I can't believe it.

5968
03:15:16,460 --> 03:15:19,140
I can't be John Wick on the last game.

5969
03:15:19,680 --> 03:15:20,160
No!

5970
03:15:21,020 --> 03:15:21,540
Guys...

5971
03:15:21,540 --> 03:15:22,940
You can be John Cena, though.

5972
03:15:23,140 --> 03:15:24,420
No, it's not the same.

5973
03:15:26,680 --> 03:15:28,760
John Wick is not John Cena, confirmed.

5974
03:15:28,760 --> 03:15:29,560
It's not the same.

5975
03:15:35,560 --> 03:15:39,340
Okay, in some alternate universe, he is definitely John Wick.

5976
03:15:39,540 --> 03:15:40,140
That's true.

5977
03:15:40,360 --> 03:15:41,040
That's true.

5978
03:15:43,040 --> 03:15:45,620
Just buff John Cena running around in a suit.

5979
03:15:45,880 --> 03:15:46,660
Suit and tie.

5980
03:15:48,220 --> 03:15:49,580
This is it, guys.

5981
03:15:51,040 --> 03:15:52,120
This is it.

5982
03:15:52,720 --> 03:15:57,200
I can't get over the fact that this is just like a giant candy cane and a werewolf.

5983
03:15:59,740 --> 03:16:00,860
The dream team.

5984
03:16:01,640 --> 03:16:03,640
This is the dream team right here.

5985
03:16:05,120 --> 03:16:05,740
Right there.

5986
03:16:05,980 --> 03:16:07,000
Oh, you're on the wrong side.

5987
03:16:07,220 --> 03:16:07,920
Right here.

5988
03:16:08,180 --> 03:16:09,020
Oh, yeah, that's me.

5989
03:16:09,120 --> 03:16:09,680
No, it's okay.

5990
03:16:09,720 --> 03:16:11,000
I'm on the right side on my screen.

5991
03:16:11,080 --> 03:16:11,840
That's all that matters.

5992
03:16:12,580 --> 03:16:13,880
I'm on the right side.

5993
03:16:17,740 --> 03:16:18,760
It's correct here.

5994
03:16:22,970 --> 03:16:23,830
This is it.

5995
03:16:24,930 --> 03:16:25,710
Okay, are we ready?

5996
03:16:25,790 --> 03:16:27,930
This is the moment that we play for the fuck.

5997
03:16:28,170 --> 03:16:29,050
Yeah, this is it.

5998
03:16:29,530 --> 03:16:30,550
Jay is above you guys.

5999
03:16:30,550 --> 03:16:34,610
I cannot get far if we're not above Jay.

6000
03:16:36,750 --> 03:16:38,210
Are we still 19?

6001
03:16:40,190 --> 03:16:40,890
I think.

6002
03:16:40,990 --> 03:16:42,350
No, Jay got above us though.

6003
03:16:42,390 --> 03:16:43,010
We're 19 though?

6004
03:16:43,410 --> 03:16:45,430
Oh, wait, Jay got above us?

6005
03:16:48,670 --> 03:16:50,070
Wait, who's 20th?

6006
03:16:50,790 --> 03:16:52,670
Where the fuck was 20th then?

6007
03:16:53,830 --> 03:16:54,350
Uh...

6008
03:16:56,450 --> 03:16:57,670
Let's see, where...

6009
03:16:58,430 --> 03:16:59,410
Oh, they're showing 10?

6010
03:17:01,090 --> 03:17:01,190
Wait, what?

6011
03:17:01,350 --> 03:17:02,070
No, we're 19.

6012
03:17:02,630 --> 03:17:03,850
Yeah, then who's 20th?

6013
03:17:04,510 --> 03:17:05,570
20th is still Jay.

6014
03:17:07,410 --> 03:17:09,030
Yo, let's fucking go!

6015
03:17:09,710 --> 03:17:10,230
Yo!

6016
03:17:11,570 --> 03:17:13,330
Yeah, they got the two points and died.

6017
03:17:13,750 --> 03:17:14,670
Yo, wait.

6018
03:17:14,670 --> 03:17:17,630
Guys, okay, Dory, you need to get points.

6019
03:17:17,630 --> 03:17:18,910
So, you need to...

6020
03:17:18,910 --> 03:17:21,450
You need to get points.

6021
03:17:21,930 --> 03:17:23,830
Where is Autumn and them landing?

6022
03:17:25,010 --> 03:17:25,530
Where is Autumn and them landing?

6023
03:17:25,530 --> 03:17:26,670
Oh, they're landing there?

6024
03:17:28,090 --> 03:17:30,130
I'm just trying to think, like, hmm...

6025
03:17:30,130 --> 03:17:31,070
I'm just trying to think, like, hmm...

6026
03:17:31,090 --> 03:17:31,730
Where can we get some...

6027
03:17:32,130 --> 03:17:33,410
Where can we get some points?

6028
03:17:35,330 --> 03:17:36,670
Okay, are we gonna do our spot though?

6029
03:17:36,930 --> 03:17:38,170
Like, uh, below Nitro Dome?

6030
03:17:38,330 --> 03:17:40,110
Or should we go to the...

6031
03:17:40,110 --> 03:17:40,930
I don't know.

6032
03:17:41,470 --> 03:17:42,890
I think we go below Nitro Dome, right?

6033
03:17:43,090 --> 03:17:43,370
Or no?

6034
03:17:43,830 --> 03:17:44,610
In the last game?

6035
03:17:44,930 --> 03:17:47,170
Well, we have to... Well, it's safe zone.

6036
03:17:47,570 --> 03:17:48,950
So, we have to get a spot.

6037
03:17:49,310 --> 03:17:52,230
Yeah, we have to get a spot and then...

6038
03:17:52,230 --> 03:17:54,130
Oh, you want to do Grim Gate then?

6039
03:17:54,330 --> 03:17:57,230
Yeah, Grim Gate and then we have to find a spot to, like, be safe.

6040
03:17:57,750 --> 03:17:58,450
Like, right after.

6041
03:17:58,450 --> 03:18:00,270
So, we can't loiter.

6042
03:18:00,390 --> 03:18:01,150
We shouldn't loiter.

6043
03:18:01,610 --> 03:18:03,570
Alright, so let's just loot it as fast as we can.

6044
03:18:03,670 --> 03:18:03,950
Oh, it's the banana dance!

6045
03:18:04,130 --> 03:18:05,750
That's the banana dance!

6046
03:18:06,430 --> 03:18:07,070
This song?

6047
03:18:07,270 --> 03:18:07,470
Yeah!

6048
03:18:07,990 --> 03:18:09,550
It's like a Fortnite meme.

6049
03:18:09,990 --> 03:18:10,830
No, it's a marshmallow.

6050
03:18:11,850 --> 03:18:13,630
It's the banana dance!

6051
03:18:13,910 --> 03:18:16,690
I saw the fucking YouTube short!

6052
03:18:17,570 --> 03:18:18,130
Wait, what?

6053
03:18:18,810 --> 03:18:19,590
Where is it?

6054
03:18:20,770 --> 03:18:22,450
I'm no longer calling him Marshmallow.

6055
03:18:22,530 --> 03:18:23,450
I'm just gonna call him Banana Man.

6056
03:18:25,010 --> 03:18:26,110
Oh, did you drop already?

6057
03:18:26,990 --> 03:18:27,990
I'm not supposed to drop?

6058
03:18:28,450 --> 03:18:29,530
Uh, I mean...

6059
03:18:29,530 --> 03:18:31,150
Yeah, you'll still make it.

6060
03:18:32,510 --> 03:18:33,650
You're good, you're good, you're good.

6061
03:18:34,770 --> 03:18:36,950
You can just glide down slowly.

6062
03:18:37,050 --> 03:18:37,550
You can glide down slowly.

6063
03:18:37,990 --> 03:18:39,410
I got confused.

6064
03:18:44,830 --> 03:18:46,250
Alright, we are good.

6065
03:18:46,510 --> 03:18:49,530
Why is there so many people landing here now?

6066
03:18:50,050 --> 03:18:52,070
We got, like, three people.

6067
03:18:52,630 --> 03:18:54,090
There's more than three!

6068
03:18:54,150 --> 03:18:55,010
It's like four!

6069
03:18:55,850 --> 03:18:57,290
There's, like, condoms here too.

6070
03:18:58,450 --> 03:18:58,610
Yeah!

6071
03:18:58,610 --> 03:18:59,910
I'm so confused!

6072
03:19:00,710 --> 03:19:01,910
It's safe zone, right?

6073
03:19:02,330 --> 03:19:03,510
Yeah, it's safe zone right now.

6074
03:19:03,570 --> 03:19:05,650
I'm just watching him, like, run around and be a gremlin.

6075
03:19:06,270 --> 03:19:07,030
Like, why?

6076
03:19:09,590 --> 03:19:11,690
Can you, like, jump through?

6077
03:19:12,030 --> 03:19:12,770
There we go.

6078
03:19:12,870 --> 03:19:14,830
We're really, like, fucked up, guys.

6079
03:19:15,610 --> 03:19:17,090
Are they gonna follow us?

6080
03:19:17,090 --> 03:19:18,110
Is that what they're gonna do?

6081
03:19:18,810 --> 03:19:19,870
I don't know, actually.

6082
03:19:20,150 --> 03:19:21,870
Are they, like, gonna follow us and try to farm us?

6083
03:19:22,490 --> 03:19:26,490
They're probably just trying to, like, loot everything as fast as they can so they can grief us.

6084
03:19:26,710 --> 03:19:27,190
I think.

6085
03:19:28,450 --> 03:19:29,650
Oh, wait, we can't have thunderbursts, right?

6086
03:19:30,550 --> 03:19:32,470
Uh, we can have...

6087
03:19:32,470 --> 03:19:33,510
I don't remember.

6088
03:19:33,830 --> 03:19:34,970
Oh, yeah, no, uh...

6089
03:19:34,970 --> 03:19:36,350
Oh, wait, so shotgun?

6090
03:19:36,470 --> 03:19:36,770
Okay.

6091
03:19:37,550 --> 03:19:38,770
Should we leave?

6092
03:19:38,850 --> 03:19:40,910
I feel like we don't have loot anymore.

6093
03:19:41,270 --> 03:19:41,450
Um...

6094
03:19:41,450 --> 03:19:43,110
We can go on the outside.

6095
03:19:43,610 --> 03:19:45,710
We're gonna hit these.

6096
03:19:45,710 --> 03:19:47,070
We're not comfortable down here.

6097
03:19:47,470 --> 03:19:48,130
We're gonna hit these.

6098
03:19:49,770 --> 03:19:50,970
No thunderburst, right?

6099
03:19:51,470 --> 03:19:52,970
Yeah, no thunderburst.

6100
03:19:53,290 --> 03:19:54,370
We can run a shotgun, though.

6101
03:19:56,890 --> 03:19:58,030
Okay, let's hit this.

6102
03:20:01,770 --> 03:20:03,150
And then let's hit these.

6103
03:20:03,430 --> 03:20:04,190
We should leave.

6104
03:20:04,450 --> 03:20:04,990
I don't feel...

6105
03:20:04,990 --> 03:20:06,750
And then take this.

6106
03:20:08,470 --> 03:20:09,330
Oh, Nuka Cola.

6107
03:20:11,410 --> 03:20:12,790
And then let's try to go up here.

6108
03:20:12,930 --> 03:20:13,410
Let's go up here.

6109
03:20:14,010 --> 03:20:14,410
Okay.

6110
03:20:16,330 --> 03:20:17,090
I'm gonna start going.

6111
03:20:21,470 --> 03:20:21,870
Ooh!

6112
03:20:23,350 --> 03:20:24,570
I have two shockwaves.

6113
03:20:24,630 --> 03:20:25,850
I can give you one just in case.

6114
03:20:27,610 --> 03:20:29,450
Unless you don't want that.

6115
03:20:29,890 --> 03:20:30,610
It's fine.

6116
03:20:32,190 --> 03:20:33,070
It's fine.

6117
03:20:33,730 --> 03:20:35,130
No, you got it!

6118
03:20:35,170 --> 03:20:36,170
I have nitro!

6119
03:20:36,890 --> 03:20:38,350
Wait, someone landed up here.

6120
03:20:38,410 --> 03:20:38,590
What?

6121
03:20:38,830 --> 03:20:40,090
Okay, I guess we're going over here?

6122
03:20:40,250 --> 03:20:42,710
I think everybody's just landing in areas where they can get kills.

6123
03:20:43,190 --> 03:20:43,590
Yeah.

6124
03:20:44,110 --> 03:20:45,770
Alright, well, let's just go this way then.

6125
03:20:45,810 --> 03:20:47,210
We have a minute to be safe, though.

6126
03:20:47,330 --> 03:20:48,990
So we should hurry.

6127
03:20:49,550 --> 03:20:50,930
We are, uh...

6128
03:20:52,110 --> 03:20:53,850
Oh my god, it's looted!

6129
03:20:55,850 --> 03:20:56,670
That's so safe, Doryu.

6130
03:20:57,350 --> 03:20:58,230
48 seconds.

6131
03:20:58,850 --> 03:21:00,690
Yeah, so we have a shotgun.

6132
03:21:00,970 --> 03:21:01,690
And that's it.

6133
03:21:03,250 --> 03:21:05,610
Is stealthy spotter enforcer okay or no?

6134
03:21:06,410 --> 03:21:07,290
Uh, yeah.

6135
03:21:07,370 --> 03:21:07,790
That's fine.

6136
03:21:07,830 --> 03:21:08,370
You can grab that.

6137
03:21:09,850 --> 03:21:12,010
Okay, I got an enforcer.

6138
03:21:14,010 --> 03:21:15,410
Oh, let's hit you up all the way.

6139
03:21:15,490 --> 03:21:16,230
Oh no, this is already taken.

6140
03:21:16,410 --> 03:21:16,750
Dang.

6141
03:21:18,150 --> 03:21:19,950
Well, I mean...

6142
03:21:19,950 --> 03:21:20,750
25 seconds.

6143
03:21:21,070 --> 03:21:21,930
Where do we go?

6144
03:21:22,210 --> 03:21:23,950
Let's keep going this way.

6145
03:21:25,850 --> 03:21:26,490
Are you sure we're safe?

6146
03:21:27,210 --> 03:21:29,590
Uh, it's safer than going south.

6147
03:21:29,750 --> 03:21:30,470
That's for sure.

6148
03:21:31,230 --> 03:21:34,130
I think if we go south, we're gonna get kinda screwed.

6149
03:21:34,410 --> 03:21:36,170
Yeah, I feel like people are...

6150
03:21:36,170 --> 03:21:37,090
Oh, 9 seconds.

6151
03:21:37,130 --> 03:21:37,750
This is scary.

6152
03:21:39,290 --> 03:21:39,810
Dang.

6153
03:21:39,890 --> 03:21:40,770
We literally have...

6154
03:21:41,570 --> 03:21:42,090
nothing.

6155
03:21:42,990 --> 03:21:43,710
Uh oh.

6156
03:21:44,950 --> 03:21:46,970
We have to be somewhere safe.

6157
03:21:47,770 --> 03:21:49,610
We could go...

6158
03:21:50,410 --> 03:21:52,030
to restored reels.

6159
03:21:53,630 --> 03:21:55,130
Or we could go...

6160
03:21:55,130 --> 03:21:56,150
Wanna hide in this bush right here?

6161
03:21:56,350 --> 03:21:57,570
Sure, let's just...

6162
03:21:57,570 --> 03:21:58,310
You know what?

6163
03:21:58,350 --> 03:21:59,130
Yeah, fuck it.

6164
03:21:59,230 --> 03:21:59,670
You know what?

6165
03:21:59,770 --> 03:22:00,430
Fuck it.

6166
03:22:02,230 --> 03:22:04,670
Wait, I wanna loot the top of this hill real quick.

6167
03:22:04,830 --> 03:22:05,970
I'm gonna be in this bush.

6168
03:22:06,170 --> 03:22:06,710
You go loot that.

6169
03:22:06,710 --> 03:22:07,330
Okay, okay, okay.

6170
03:22:08,290 --> 03:22:09,390
You know what?

6171
03:22:09,470 --> 03:22:10,110
Fuck it.

6172
03:22:12,350 --> 03:22:14,010
I'll be the test subject up here.

6173
03:22:14,150 --> 03:22:16,810
Whatever makes I feel safe in my bush.

6174
03:22:19,510 --> 03:22:21,110
Nobody will know.

6175
03:22:21,770 --> 03:22:22,530
Nobody will know.

6176
03:22:22,530 --> 03:22:23,850
Yeah, I got nitros.

6177
03:22:23,850 --> 03:22:24,830
So that's good.

6178
03:22:25,650 --> 03:22:29,570
I don't feel safe in this dangerous world of fortniters.

6179
03:22:30,490 --> 03:22:34,230
Uh, okay, so...

6180
03:22:34,230 --> 03:22:35,730
I got like some...

6181
03:22:35,730 --> 03:22:37,270
I wanna come down.

6182
03:22:37,750 --> 03:22:38,590
The bush life.

6183
03:22:40,310 --> 03:22:43,130
I swear to god, if you bring somebody over...

6184
03:22:43,130 --> 03:22:45,710
Crazy, I ban a weapon, but it still spawns on the map?

6185
03:22:46,870 --> 03:22:52,870
I swear to god, Doryu, if you bring a fucking uninvited visitor in the bush, I swear to god...

6186
03:22:52,870 --> 03:22:53,830
You have a gun?

6187
03:22:54,230 --> 03:22:54,890
Yeah, I do.

6188
03:22:55,070 --> 03:22:55,870
I got the...

6189
03:22:56,590 --> 03:22:57,390
Selfie spotty.

6190
03:22:57,710 --> 03:22:59,010
Oh, you got the selfie?

6191
03:22:59,270 --> 03:23:01,170
Yeah, that's not bad, right?

6192
03:23:01,770 --> 03:23:02,730
No, that's not bad.

6193
03:23:02,850 --> 03:23:04,670
Uh, I'm looking at the list right now.

6194
03:23:04,770 --> 03:23:09,990
It's only like SMGs, and then hand cannon, pistol, and a flintlock?

6195
03:23:09,990 --> 03:23:10,550
Nobody's dead.

6196
03:23:10,750 --> 03:23:13,350
Why is this always the last game where nobody's dead?

6197
03:23:13,770 --> 03:23:14,170
Right?

6198
03:23:15,010 --> 03:23:16,230
I wanna look at your pickle, Rick.

6199
03:23:16,350 --> 03:23:16,970
I'm gonna get your pickle.

6200
03:23:16,970 --> 03:23:17,990
Oh, it's cause it's 19...

6201
03:23:17,990 --> 03:23:19,850
Oh, the storm starts in 16 seconds.

6202
03:23:19,970 --> 03:23:20,510
Okay, that's...

6203
03:23:21,510 --> 03:23:22,250
Yeah, that's why.

6204
03:23:23,730 --> 03:23:24,610
They start...

6205
03:23:24,610 --> 03:23:26,730
They start fighting in 16 seconds.

6206
03:23:26,970 --> 03:23:27,910
Or 10 seconds.

6207
03:23:28,810 --> 03:23:35,310
Okay, if someone shoots us there, that means somebody has, like, like, has been, like, following us.

6208
03:23:35,590 --> 03:23:37,190
You know what's funny about this bush, though?

6209
03:23:37,310 --> 03:23:37,730
What?

6210
03:23:37,850 --> 03:23:45,310
Is that this bush, even though it's like a random ass, like, place to hide, it's very notorious for just randomly getting ran through.

6211
03:23:45,870 --> 03:23:47,950
Oh, I don't like that.

6212
03:23:48,350 --> 03:23:50,550
Why did you tell me that now?

6213
03:24:02,750 --> 03:24:06,830
This is how I'm gonna feel if Doki doesn't get her pho.

6214
03:24:07,070 --> 03:24:08,910
Guys, I need my pho.

6215
03:24:08,950 --> 03:24:10,790
Guys, I need my pho.

6216
03:24:10,870 --> 03:24:11,230
Wait!

6217
03:24:11,690 --> 03:24:12,250
Apply!

6218
03:24:13,170 --> 03:24:13,730
What?

6219
03:24:13,890 --> 03:24:14,690
Apply got eliminated!

6220
03:24:15,250 --> 03:24:15,470
Yeah!

6221
03:24:16,210 --> 03:24:16,910
Let's go!

6222
03:24:18,150 --> 03:24:19,150
Let's go!

6223
03:24:19,150 --> 03:24:19,590
Let's fucking go!

6224
03:24:21,490 --> 03:24:22,270
Let's go!

6225
03:24:24,290 --> 03:24:25,610
Oh my god!

6226
03:24:26,730 --> 03:24:28,050
Oh my god!

6227
03:24:28,230 --> 03:24:28,770
We got less!

6228
03:24:32,950 --> 03:24:33,870
We got less!

6229
03:24:33,870 --> 03:24:36,770
Doki, we can die happily now.

6230
03:24:36,910 --> 03:24:38,870
Yeah, I can naturally go fucking eat now.

6231
03:24:39,690 --> 03:24:41,930
I can literally just leave this game.

6232
03:24:44,570 --> 03:24:45,170
Yes!

6233
03:24:46,910 --> 03:24:48,310
Oh my fucking god.

6234
03:24:49,010 --> 03:24:50,170
Look, this is not...

6235
03:24:50,170 --> 03:24:50,850
It was meant to be.

6236
03:24:51,610 --> 03:24:53,570
We're not being cowards right now.

6237
03:24:53,630 --> 03:24:55,430
Look, I need to eat, guys.

6238
03:24:56,550 --> 03:24:59,330
No, listen, we got $125 on the line here, okay?

6239
03:24:59,530 --> 03:24:59,810
Yeah!

6240
03:25:00,470 --> 03:25:01,510
Yeah, exactly.

6241
03:25:02,010 --> 03:25:03,330
What are the other teams gonna get?

6242
03:25:03,390 --> 03:25:04,150
Not $125?

6243
03:25:04,450 --> 03:25:05,270
Oh my god, it's coming by.

6244
03:25:08,650 --> 03:25:10,910
I'm gonna nitro us if they jump in here.

6245
03:25:11,630 --> 03:25:12,430
BT doves.

6246
03:25:13,770 --> 03:25:14,990
Oh, they ran away.

6247
03:25:15,210 --> 03:25:16,890
But there are gunfights to our revenge.

6248
03:25:16,890 --> 03:25:17,150
Right.

6249
03:25:17,150 --> 03:25:17,610
Or here.

6250
03:25:18,030 --> 03:25:21,410
We might be able to catch someone that goes by us.

6251
03:25:21,850 --> 03:25:22,310
Yeah.

6252
03:25:22,590 --> 03:25:22,650
Oh, wait.

6253
03:25:22,730 --> 03:25:23,830
They're like kinda jumping around.

6254
03:25:25,730 --> 03:25:27,010
Wait, where's the other medallion?

6255
03:25:27,150 --> 03:25:29,050
Okay, one, two, and then...

6256
03:25:29,050 --> 03:25:30,670
I don't even see the third one.

6257
03:25:31,350 --> 03:25:32,570
Only two medallions.

6258
03:25:34,470 --> 03:25:35,710
We're good, we're good, we're good.

6259
03:25:37,470 --> 03:25:38,690
I see them.

6260
03:25:39,550 --> 03:25:40,690
He's just running around.

6261
03:25:41,190 --> 03:25:43,090
I wanna shoot them so bad, Doki.

6262
03:25:43,490 --> 03:25:45,330
There's a medallion right next to us.

6263
03:25:45,370 --> 03:25:46,670
I think they're gonna fuck us up.

6264
03:25:46,670 --> 03:25:48,150
Yeah, we don't.

6265
03:25:48,290 --> 03:25:53,950
I think the medallion is gonna fuck us up if we didn't get any closer.

6266
03:25:54,730 --> 03:25:56,430
What do you think the commentators are saying?

6267
03:25:56,550 --> 03:25:57,790
Do you think they're watching us just like...

6268
03:25:57,790 --> 03:25:58,870
They're just like, they don't understand.

6269
03:25:58,950 --> 03:25:59,890
This is for pho.

6270
03:26:00,010 --> 03:26:01,070
Like, they don't understand.

6271
03:26:01,310 --> 03:26:03,590
Like, literally, we just got pho because of this.

6272
03:26:03,710 --> 03:26:04,950
Like, we fucking won.

6273
03:26:05,530 --> 03:26:06,630
Like, you know what?

6274
03:26:06,770 --> 03:26:08,070
I'll order you some pho.

6275
03:26:08,070 --> 03:26:08,850
No, actually, no.

6276
03:26:08,850 --> 03:26:10,090
You gotta go there and eat pho.

6277
03:26:10,650 --> 03:26:12,890
Ordering pho is not good as eating ass quiz.

6278
03:26:13,150 --> 03:26:16,330
I actually have a really, really good phubble at home.

6279
03:26:16,330 --> 03:26:17,390
But, like, you're right.

6280
03:26:17,470 --> 03:26:18,530
It never hits the same, though.

6281
03:26:18,530 --> 03:26:20,250
Yeah, it never hits the same going out.

6282
03:26:20,610 --> 03:26:21,070
Yeah.

6283
03:26:21,110 --> 03:26:21,450
FIFA.

6284
03:26:23,070 --> 03:26:26,290
I can't believe we ended up getting the pho.

6285
03:26:26,510 --> 03:26:27,410
I can't believe it.

6286
03:26:27,410 --> 03:26:28,130
They literally died for it.

6287
03:26:28,130 --> 03:26:28,310
I'm so glad.

6288
03:26:29,050 --> 03:26:30,050
I'm so happy.

6289
03:26:30,230 --> 03:26:30,310
Yeah.

6290
03:26:30,950 --> 03:26:31,690
Thank you.

6291
03:26:33,030 --> 03:26:35,890
At least we're better than Overwatch players.

6292
03:26:36,510 --> 03:26:37,270
This is true.

6293
03:26:37,490 --> 03:26:37,930
Yeah.

6294
03:26:37,950 --> 03:26:39,510
We were technically above them.

6295
03:26:39,510 --> 03:26:40,090
I mean, it doesn't take much.

6296
03:26:40,150 --> 03:26:40,850
But, like, yeah.

6297
03:26:44,170 --> 03:26:45,110
I can say it.

6298
03:26:45,190 --> 03:26:46,310
I used to be an Overwatch player.

6299
03:26:46,330 --> 03:26:47,030
I can say it.

6300
03:26:47,870 --> 03:26:52,670
All the Overwatchers are gonna be like, yeah, but what peak are you, Doki?

6301
03:26:53,130 --> 03:26:53,890
What's your peak?

6302
03:26:54,990 --> 03:26:55,390
4500.

6303
03:26:56,530 --> 03:26:56,930
Shiiiit!

6304
03:26:56,990 --> 03:26:57,690
Yeah, that's right.

6305
03:26:58,270 --> 03:27:01,010
And they're gonna be like, okay, but what was your role then?

6306
03:27:01,810 --> 03:27:02,210
Support.

6307
03:27:03,250 --> 03:27:05,250
And then you're going to be like, okay, what support were you?

6308
03:27:05,250 --> 03:27:06,070
Lucio, Ana, Zen.

6309
03:27:06,710 --> 03:27:07,770
Yeah, Lucio's Giga.

6310
03:27:07,910 --> 03:27:10,070
Yeah, Lucio was my one trick.

6311
03:27:10,170 --> 03:27:11,270
And Ana's extra Giga.

6312
03:27:11,470 --> 03:27:13,410
Yeah, Lucio used to be my one trick.

6313
03:27:13,510 --> 03:27:15,790
And then, like, they gutted Lucio.

6314
03:27:17,030 --> 03:27:17,810
R.I.P.

6315
03:27:17,830 --> 03:27:18,210
Lucio.

6316
03:27:19,130 --> 03:27:20,550
Wait, okay, we have to move.

6317
03:27:20,850 --> 03:27:23,690
We have like 30 seconds though, so we're gonna go...

6318
03:27:23,690 --> 03:27:25,650
There is a bush?

6319
03:27:26,370 --> 03:27:27,970
I think that's like right here?

6320
03:27:28,270 --> 03:27:28,890
Oh my god, the next bush.

6321
03:27:28,930 --> 03:27:29,890
There's a bush over here.

6322
03:27:29,950 --> 03:27:30,870
Okay, nice.

6323
03:27:31,030 --> 03:27:31,730
Our next home.

6324
03:27:33,730 --> 03:27:34,930
Our next house.

6325
03:27:35,090 --> 03:27:36,010
This is Fortnite gameplay.

6326
03:27:36,450 --> 03:27:39,290
How is only two people dead in this fucking...

6327
03:27:39,890 --> 03:27:41,390
J3 and apply?

6328
03:27:41,650 --> 03:27:46,150
Yeah guys, I was in the Overwatch community when J3 used to be Jesus3.

6329
03:27:46,430 --> 03:27:48,110
Like, that's his old name.

6330
03:27:48,410 --> 03:27:49,070
Did he really?

6331
03:27:49,310 --> 03:27:50,910
Yeah, his old name was Jesus3.

6332
03:27:51,250 --> 03:27:54,130
And then he changed into J3 when he got partnered.

6333
03:27:54,790 --> 03:27:56,370
Or no, after he got partnered.

6334
03:27:56,430 --> 03:27:57,290
No, it was a while back.

6335
03:27:57,490 --> 03:27:58,570
Wait, why did he un-Jesus?

6336
03:27:58,930 --> 03:28:01,150
I don't fucking know.

6337
03:28:01,350 --> 03:28:08,530
I think he realized maybe having your name as Jesus for your Twitch name might not be the best idea.

6338
03:28:08,970 --> 03:28:10,230
He could be Jesus though.

6339
03:28:10,870 --> 03:28:11,870
Oh, that's true.

6340
03:28:12,130 --> 03:28:13,030
If he has an accent.

6341
03:28:13,910 --> 03:28:14,130
I don't think he's like...

6342
03:28:14,130 --> 03:28:16,130
I don't think he's a Jesus person.

6343
03:28:17,810 --> 03:28:21,310
Does he look like he walks on water?

6344
03:28:22,470 --> 03:28:24,590
Yeah, he does look like he walks on water.

6345
03:28:25,110 --> 03:28:27,530
Alright, let's go now.

6346
03:28:28,290 --> 03:28:29,410
Oh my god, our bush!

6347
03:28:29,410 --> 03:28:29,950
Our bush!

6348
03:28:30,150 --> 03:28:30,870
Our lovely bush!

6349
03:28:31,650 --> 03:28:32,690
Our bush!

6350
03:28:32,850 --> 03:28:33,930
Our bush!

6351
03:28:34,930 --> 03:28:36,410
I have nitro as well.

6352
03:28:37,010 --> 03:28:37,870
Okay, okay.

6353
03:28:38,930 --> 03:28:43,310
Whenever the nitro runs out, only pop it when you're out in the open with no cover.

6354
03:28:43,910 --> 03:28:44,890
Otherwise, don't even use it.

6355
03:28:45,370 --> 03:28:46,730
I think we should be good here.

6356
03:28:47,250 --> 03:28:49,530
Do you think they saw us run to that bush?

6357
03:28:51,090 --> 03:28:51,970
No, never.

6358
03:28:52,470 --> 03:28:53,870
Do you think they saw us?

6359
03:28:55,890 --> 03:28:57,730
I'm in the bush right now.

6360
03:28:58,190 --> 03:28:59,690
I think we're gonna be okay.

6361
03:29:06,590 --> 03:29:07,030
See?

6362
03:29:07,030 --> 03:29:07,830
Oh, we're good!

6363
03:29:07,970 --> 03:29:08,590
We're good!

6364
03:29:08,890 --> 03:29:09,650
Come here, Doki!

6365
03:29:09,830 --> 03:29:11,150
It's nice and cozy in here!

6366
03:29:11,670 --> 03:29:13,130
Whoa, whoa, whoa, bush time!

6367
03:29:13,570 --> 03:29:14,590
We're the bush people!

6368
03:29:14,990 --> 03:29:15,870
The Bushmen!

6369
03:29:17,970 --> 03:29:21,010
I mean, we're more of a bush candy cane.

6370
03:29:21,330 --> 03:29:22,130
And a bushman.

6371
03:29:22,150 --> 03:29:24,030
I told you, the skins are good luck!

6372
03:29:24,230 --> 03:29:25,310
The safety bush.

6373
03:29:26,230 --> 03:29:27,570
Yo, one of the purses died.

6374
03:29:27,790 --> 03:29:28,350
Think about it.

6375
03:29:28,410 --> 03:29:29,630
Oh, thank god, that's not us.

6376
03:29:30,650 --> 03:29:32,670
We're definitely not dying any time soon.

6377
03:29:32,810 --> 03:29:33,350
Yeah, exactly.

6378
03:29:35,150 --> 03:29:36,530
The bush is safe.

6379
03:29:37,490 --> 03:29:39,050
Mr. Beast would love this.

6380
03:29:40,690 --> 03:29:43,410
You think Mr. Beast lives in a million dollar bush?

6381
03:29:43,790 --> 03:29:44,130
You think Mr. Beast lives in a million dollar bush?

6382
03:29:44,130 --> 03:29:44,950
Oh, a hundred percent.

6383
03:29:44,950 --> 03:29:46,010
If he could, he would.

6384
03:29:47,290 --> 03:29:48,650
Like, what do you do with all that money?

6385
03:29:48,790 --> 03:29:50,490
You have to honestly ask yourself.

6386
03:29:50,530 --> 03:29:52,050
Honestly, what would you do with all that money?

6387
03:29:52,110 --> 03:29:53,390
I don't know, cure the fucking blind?

6388
03:29:54,150 --> 03:29:54,550
Yeah.

6389
03:29:56,130 --> 03:29:57,010
Literally, what he does.

6390
03:29:57,930 --> 03:30:00,090
He has so much money.

6391
03:30:00,190 --> 03:30:02,810
He just does all these elaborate stuff.

6392
03:30:03,730 --> 03:30:04,530
Is there a way to...

6393
03:30:04,530 --> 03:30:05,390
Like, what else would you do?

6394
03:30:06,170 --> 03:30:09,370
Can you just pay everyone the same in this journey?

6395
03:30:09,570 --> 03:30:10,090
What's that sound?

6396
03:30:10,490 --> 03:30:12,330
Oh, that's the island that's spawning.

6397
03:30:12,330 --> 03:30:14,290
Oh, okay.

6398
03:30:14,430 --> 03:30:15,590
That scared the shit out of me.

6399
03:30:15,590 --> 03:30:16,250
We could go up to the island.

6400
03:30:16,470 --> 03:30:17,170
You wanna go up to the island?

6401
03:30:17,250 --> 03:30:20,190
I feel like everybody's going to go to the island for better loot, right?

6402
03:30:20,830 --> 03:30:21,690
Pretty much, yeah.

6403
03:30:22,030 --> 03:30:24,250
So what we could do then...

6404
03:30:24,250 --> 03:30:25,870
Is we could go...

6405
03:30:25,870 --> 03:30:26,590
Where's the nearest bush?

6406
03:30:26,850 --> 03:30:29,330
I think the next bush is right over here.

6407
03:30:30,090 --> 03:30:30,970
That's so far.

6408
03:30:31,590 --> 03:30:32,650
Oh yeah, they're fighting here.

6409
03:30:33,770 --> 03:30:35,710
There's a team literally right there.

6410
03:30:36,450 --> 03:30:37,530
Yeah, I mean, I would...

6411
03:30:37,530 --> 03:30:39,210
I assume they would all wanna go there.

6412
03:30:40,670 --> 03:30:41,950
Wait, do you hear that?

6413
03:30:42,490 --> 03:30:43,890
Yeah, they're like right here on the red ping.

6414
03:30:44,490 --> 03:30:45,430
Yeah, I heard it.

6415
03:30:47,130 --> 03:30:47,450
What's that?

6416
03:30:48,230 --> 03:30:49,510
They're gonna go up now, I think?

6417
03:30:50,070 --> 03:30:50,830
Should we leave?

6418
03:30:52,150 --> 03:30:53,470
I think they're just gonna glove up.

6419
03:30:53,530 --> 03:30:54,470
Yeah, they're gloving up right now.

6420
03:30:54,590 --> 03:30:55,430
Okay, here, follow me.

6421
03:30:55,450 --> 03:30:55,650
Follow me.

6422
03:30:55,850 --> 03:30:55,850
Follow me.

6423
03:30:55,850 --> 03:30:56,370
Yeah, I was gonna say...

6424
03:30:57,570 --> 03:30:59,670
Like, I don't think we should be close to that.

6425
03:31:04,370 --> 03:31:05,690
Hearing all those sounds...

6426
03:31:05,690 --> 03:31:07,150
I just do not feel comfortable.

6427
03:31:08,830 --> 03:31:10,550
Okay, let's pop a...

6428
03:31:10,550 --> 03:31:11,290
Oh, I'm trying to think.

6429
03:31:12,330 --> 03:31:13,530
There should be a team over there.

6430
03:31:14,070 --> 03:31:15,210
Okay, they have... Keep following me.

6431
03:31:15,290 --> 03:31:15,610
Keep following me.

6432
03:31:15,810 --> 03:31:16,610
I'm gonna nitrous.

6433
03:31:17,350 --> 03:31:18,910
And then just keep sprinting.

6434
03:31:20,890 --> 03:31:21,990
Okay, I'm sprinting.

6435
03:31:21,990 --> 03:31:22,510
I'm sprinting.

6436
03:31:26,650 --> 03:31:27,790
We're gonna go...

6437
03:31:27,790 --> 03:31:29,170
We can go to this house, actually.

6438
03:31:30,910 --> 03:31:33,170
Wouldn't those people up top there would cross here?

6439
03:31:34,090 --> 03:31:36,670
They would, but we can chill at the very, very top here.

6440
03:31:37,170 --> 03:31:37,530
Inside?

6441
03:31:37,730 --> 03:31:38,490
Oh yeah, you are.

6442
03:31:38,550 --> 03:31:38,850
Okay, cool.

6443
03:31:38,930 --> 03:31:39,330
Come up here.

6444
03:31:41,650 --> 03:31:42,010
Nice.

6445
03:31:42,010 --> 03:31:43,670
Now we're cozy.

6446
03:31:44,250 --> 03:31:44,750
Yeah.

6447
03:31:45,090 --> 03:31:47,230
All we're doing is we're playing OG...

6448
03:31:47,750 --> 03:31:48,990
OG Apex Rotates.

6449
03:31:49,410 --> 03:31:50,650
Where it was just...

6450
03:31:50,650 --> 03:31:52,530
Yeah, that was the island.

6451
03:31:52,870 --> 03:31:54,490
The island disappeared, right?

6452
03:31:55,210 --> 03:31:58,050
No, it stays up there, but that sound means that they captured the flag.

6453
03:31:58,330 --> 03:32:00,310
Oh, I can't believe it.

6454
03:32:00,430 --> 03:32:01,830
We upgraded our house.

6455
03:32:02,250 --> 03:32:03,490
We're vibing.

6456
03:32:03,530 --> 03:32:04,690
We pushed the house.

6457
03:32:04,690 --> 03:32:05,090
Guys!

6458
03:32:05,330 --> 03:32:06,170
We made it!

6459
03:32:06,490 --> 03:32:08,690
We made it, guys!

6460
03:32:09,650 --> 03:32:11,370
Does your head poke through there?

6461
03:32:11,450 --> 03:32:11,970
Okay, it doesn't.

6462
03:32:12,150 --> 03:32:14,370
Guys, we made it.

6463
03:32:14,930 --> 03:32:20,610
Okay, whatever you do, don't, like, even move while crouched, because they can hear it.

6464
03:32:20,650 --> 03:32:21,890
It just doesn't show an audio indicator.

6465
03:32:22,350 --> 03:32:22,790
Oh, okay.

6466
03:32:23,410 --> 03:32:26,490
If they're, like, coming up to us, just, like, let them...

6467
03:32:26,490 --> 03:32:29,350
Alright, my hands are off the fucking mouse and keyboard.

6468
03:32:31,030 --> 03:32:31,830
Honestly, same.

6469
03:32:32,010 --> 03:32:33,270
I'm literally just, like, sitting here.

6470
03:32:33,610 --> 03:32:36,070
My god, it's a free MrBeast house!

6471
03:32:36,370 --> 03:32:37,330
He gave us a house!

6472
03:32:40,720 --> 03:32:41,200
MrBeast!

6473
03:32:41,580 --> 03:32:42,140
Thank you!

6474
03:32:42,440 --> 03:32:43,680
MrBeast, you're the best!

6475
03:32:44,080 --> 03:32:45,240
Except my boyfriend never.

6476
03:32:46,120 --> 03:32:47,100
Oh my god!

6477
03:32:49,620 --> 03:32:50,600
We did it!

6478
03:32:51,000 --> 03:32:54,140
I think on the next zone close, I feel like it's gonna keep pulling south.

6479
03:32:55,140 --> 03:32:58,420
Because usually the Fortnite zones, they always go to the opposite side.

6480
03:32:58,480 --> 03:32:59,660
Oh, they spawned somebody back.

6481
03:32:59,960 --> 03:33:00,880
It was back to 37.

6482
03:33:02,200 --> 03:33:03,380
Wait, I thought it was at 37.

6483
03:33:03,680 --> 03:33:04,540
No, it was, like, 36.

6484
03:33:05,060 --> 03:33:05,540
Oh!

6485
03:33:07,560 --> 03:33:08,200
Oh, we're good!

6486
03:33:09,260 --> 03:33:09,740
Okay.

6487
03:33:11,180 --> 03:33:12,540
That bush is out of zone.

6488
03:33:12,620 --> 03:33:13,480
We can go to this bush.

6489
03:33:14,040 --> 03:33:15,000
Or I think this one.

6490
03:33:15,040 --> 03:33:15,580
We can go this one.

6491
03:33:15,680 --> 03:33:16,120
Wanna go that one?

6492
03:33:16,400 --> 03:33:17,160
Are we gonna make it?

6493
03:33:17,360 --> 03:33:19,260
Wait, somebody's gliding above us.

6494
03:33:19,460 --> 03:33:20,340
We're gonna chill, we're gonna chill.

6495
03:33:22,580 --> 03:33:23,480
Oh, I'm scared.

6496
03:33:24,300 --> 03:33:26,280
So many people gliding above us.

6497
03:33:26,660 --> 03:33:27,700
I have a med kit.

6498
03:33:28,200 --> 03:33:28,900
Chill here.

6499
03:33:29,080 --> 03:33:31,220
I'm gonna inspect real quick.

6500
03:33:32,920 --> 03:33:34,300
Wait, there's a shockwave here?

6501
03:33:36,140 --> 03:33:37,780
Let me check that.

6502
03:33:40,060 --> 03:33:41,140
Uh, Joki, you can come out.

6503
03:33:41,220 --> 03:33:41,660
Come out, come out.

6504
03:33:44,200 --> 03:33:45,160
We're gonna run to that bush.

6505
03:33:45,720 --> 03:33:46,560
Okay, we're running to the bush.

6506
03:33:46,760 --> 03:33:47,440
Oh, wait, no?

6507
03:33:48,660 --> 03:33:49,400
Where are they gloving to?

6508
03:33:49,560 --> 03:33:50,640
Okay, we're gonna yoink this.

6509
03:33:53,140 --> 03:33:54,440
Ooh, that's our bunker now.

6510
03:33:54,960 --> 03:33:55,620
We're gonna chill here.

6511
03:33:55,720 --> 03:33:56,240
We're gonna chill in here.

6512
03:33:57,100 --> 03:33:57,700
Is that in?

6513
03:33:58,300 --> 03:33:59,260
Yeah, it's in.

6514
03:33:59,900 --> 03:34:01,100
Our house now, yoink.

6515
03:34:02,480 --> 03:34:02,760
Yoink.

6516
03:34:03,140 --> 03:34:04,720
Thank you, MrBeast.

6517
03:34:05,940 --> 03:34:06,780
Oh, somebody's next to us.

6518
03:34:07,780 --> 03:34:08,600
We're gonna do this.

6519
03:34:10,980 --> 03:34:11,840
113 on them?

6520
03:34:12,060 --> 03:34:12,400
Where is he?

6521
03:34:13,060 --> 03:34:14,300
They're right next to us.

6522
03:34:18,220 --> 03:34:18,700
Cracked.

6523
03:34:21,480 --> 03:34:22,200
Seven flush.

6524
03:34:22,740 --> 03:34:23,360
Got him?

6525
03:34:23,720 --> 03:34:24,860
Oh, let's go, Joki!

6526
03:34:25,120 --> 03:34:26,000
Where's the other one at?

6527
03:34:26,560 --> 03:34:29,440
Nuka-Cola, Nuka-Cola.

6528
03:34:30,480 --> 03:34:31,320
Nuka-Cola.

6529
03:34:31,680 --> 03:34:32,360
I'm holding it.

6530
03:34:33,820 --> 03:34:34,760
Did you get him?

6531
03:34:35,160 --> 03:34:36,100
No, not yet, not yet.

6532
03:34:36,360 --> 03:34:37,140
I'm gonna do this.

6533
03:34:40,540 --> 03:34:41,820
I don't know where you got shot at.

6534
03:34:42,080 --> 03:34:42,800
Oh, you got him.

6535
03:34:42,860 --> 03:34:43,160
You got him.

6536
03:34:43,360 --> 03:34:44,040
Yeah, I got him.

6537
03:34:44,060 --> 03:34:47,700
Okay, I can get the gloves.

6538
03:34:49,000 --> 03:34:49,840
And I'm getting this.

6539
03:34:50,140 --> 03:34:50,960
Okay, I'm coming over.

6540
03:34:51,080 --> 03:34:52,260
Do you want shockwaves?

6541
03:34:52,720 --> 03:34:54,300
No, I mean, I could hold it.

6542
03:34:55,440 --> 03:34:57,420
Okay, I'm gonna chill here for a sec.

6543
03:34:57,520 --> 03:34:58,820
And I'm just gonna drop...

6544
03:34:59,980 --> 03:35:01,100
I'm gonna drop this one.

6545
03:35:01,300 --> 03:35:01,600
Whoa.

6546
03:35:07,530 --> 03:35:08,610
Where's his teammate go?

6547
03:35:08,910 --> 03:35:09,410
Oh, what?

6548
03:35:10,150 --> 03:35:12,310
This guy had insane stuff.

6549
03:35:12,650 --> 03:35:13,350
I mean...

6550
03:35:13,350 --> 03:35:14,550
I assume so.

6551
03:35:14,850 --> 03:35:16,830
He was jumping everywhere.

6552
03:35:18,270 --> 03:35:19,230
We're in zone.

6553
03:35:19,570 --> 03:35:20,670
Yeah, we're in zone, yeah.

6554
03:35:20,830 --> 03:35:21,250
Hey!

6555
03:35:24,290 --> 03:35:24,830
Yay!

6556
03:35:26,110 --> 03:35:27,710
Alright, we're chillin' here.

6557
03:35:27,830 --> 03:35:29,810
Okay, so we got one kill.

6558
03:35:29,970 --> 03:35:30,710
I'm proud of us.

6559
03:35:30,890 --> 03:35:32,850
I'm gonna drop those so you have movement.

6560
03:35:33,670 --> 03:35:34,930
Here's a portal bunker.

6561
03:35:35,550 --> 03:35:36,510
Okay, I'll...

6562
03:35:36,510 --> 03:35:38,150
Actually, do you want the shockwaves or no?

6563
03:35:39,410 --> 03:35:40,530
They grab the card.

6564
03:35:41,130 --> 03:35:41,850
They're back here.

6565
03:35:46,470 --> 03:35:46,950
42?

6566
03:35:48,230 --> 03:35:48,710
36?

6567
03:35:52,710 --> 03:35:53,570
Oh my god.

6568
03:35:55,550 --> 03:35:58,050
I think they're gonna try to go for a revive at some point.

6569
03:35:58,390 --> 03:35:58,870
But...

6570
03:36:00,330 --> 03:36:01,870
I'm gonna drop heals here.

6571
03:36:02,090 --> 03:36:02,470
Alright.

6572
03:36:02,710 --> 03:36:04,030
I'm gonna leave them inside here.

6573
03:36:04,870 --> 03:36:06,190
I'm gonna carry the bunk just in case.

6574
03:36:06,190 --> 03:36:07,350
Thank god there's no lobos here.

6575
03:36:08,390 --> 03:36:09,350
Thank god.

6576
03:36:15,180 --> 03:36:16,800
I think they're gonna try to go for a rose.

6577
03:36:17,240 --> 03:36:17,980
Oh, look!

6578
03:36:18,060 --> 03:36:18,860
We're not dead last!

6579
03:36:19,260 --> 03:36:20,660
Wait, the house is back.

6580
03:36:22,300 --> 03:36:24,240
The one thing I'm afraid of is...

6581
03:36:24,240 --> 03:36:25,580
Oh, the island's gonna be...

6582
03:36:25,580 --> 03:36:26,720
Kinda in.

6583
03:36:26,880 --> 03:36:27,600
Yeah, yeah.

6584
03:36:28,760 --> 03:36:29,240
Oh?

6585
03:36:30,000 --> 03:36:30,480
41?

6586
03:36:36,490 --> 03:36:37,950
I actually don't have too much ammo.

6587
03:36:38,730 --> 03:36:39,950
Oh, me too.

6588
03:36:40,070 --> 03:36:40,610
I realize.

6589
03:36:42,850 --> 03:36:44,370
We should conserve it, right?

6590
03:36:44,370 --> 03:36:46,690
Yeah, I'm gonna stop doing damage.

6591
03:36:46,830 --> 03:36:47,330
I'm chillin'.

6592
03:36:48,210 --> 03:36:49,030
People are shit over here.

6593
03:36:49,090 --> 03:36:50,530
There's gonna be a team up top here.

6594
03:36:52,930 --> 03:36:54,070
Just be very careful.

6595
03:36:54,150 --> 03:36:54,870
Oh, yeah, yeah.

6596
03:36:54,990 --> 03:36:56,890
Let me just chill here.

6597
03:36:57,170 --> 03:36:59,570
Oh my god, there's fucking three medallions next to us.

6598
03:37:00,010 --> 03:37:00,470
Right?

6599
03:37:01,510 --> 03:37:02,510
We're so popular.

6600
03:37:03,010 --> 03:37:03,870
Oh my god.

6601
03:37:05,070 --> 03:37:05,890
Hey guys.

6602
03:37:07,230 --> 03:37:08,690
Oh, they're fighting up there now.

6603
03:37:08,990 --> 03:37:09,450
Yeah.

6604
03:37:09,450 --> 03:37:09,630
Yeah.

6605
03:37:10,390 --> 03:37:12,630
Oh, zone is not near us.

6606
03:37:12,950 --> 03:37:14,630
This is gonna be a little awkward.

6607
03:37:16,950 --> 03:37:18,250
Can I shoot through these holes?

6608
03:37:18,530 --> 03:37:19,650
Can I shoot the hole through the holes?

6609
03:37:20,010 --> 03:37:21,050
I'm pretty sure you can.

6610
03:37:21,090 --> 03:37:21,350
Can you?

6611
03:37:21,510 --> 03:37:22,750
Okay, that's cool.

6612
03:37:25,430 --> 03:37:26,610
Just like Apex.

6613
03:37:29,350 --> 03:37:30,190
These guys zoom.

6614
03:37:35,280 --> 03:37:36,680
Where are my bullets going?

6615
03:37:37,040 --> 03:37:38,580
I swear I see them hitting this guy.

6616
03:37:38,600 --> 03:37:39,980
I don't know, but I'm just looking through these holes.

6617
03:37:42,900 --> 03:37:44,420
I literally have...

6618
03:37:44,420 --> 03:37:44,960
I literally have...

6619
03:37:44,960 --> 03:37:46,640
Oh, this is like...

6620
03:37:46,640 --> 03:37:47,640
Heat vision.

6621
03:37:48,860 --> 03:37:49,360
Which one?

6622
03:37:49,520 --> 03:37:50,560
Oh, you're talking about the thermal?

6623
03:37:50,760 --> 03:37:51,460
Yeah, yeah, thermal.

6624
03:37:52,180 --> 03:37:55,080
Okay, so what we're gonna have to do is we're gonna try to get to...

6625
03:37:55,080 --> 03:37:55,360
Is this it?

6626
03:37:56,500 --> 03:37:57,260
That's not it.

6627
03:37:57,360 --> 03:37:57,600
Okay.

6628
03:37:58,740 --> 03:37:59,580
People right here?

6629
03:38:01,180 --> 03:38:03,100
So what I'm thinking we do...

6630
03:38:03,100 --> 03:38:04,480
Is we're gonna try to get to that rock.

6631
03:38:05,700 --> 03:38:07,480
And we're gonna make a...

6632
03:38:08,040 --> 03:38:08,440
Bunker?

6633
03:38:08,540 --> 03:38:08,860
Yeah.

6634
03:38:11,300 --> 03:38:12,040
Nitroly or what?

6635
03:38:12,640 --> 03:38:13,880
Oh yeah, you have nitro still, yeah?

6636
03:38:14,040 --> 03:38:14,520
Yeah, yeah.

6637
03:38:15,360 --> 03:38:16,320
I can nitro us.

6638
03:38:16,900 --> 03:38:17,720
Oh, what the?

6639
03:38:17,840 --> 03:38:18,600
Oh yeah, which one?

6640
03:38:18,960 --> 03:38:19,320
Nitro?

6641
03:38:19,340 --> 03:38:19,720
Nitro now?

6642
03:38:20,100 --> 03:38:21,520
Okay, let's go.

6643
03:38:21,660 --> 03:38:22,140
Follow me.

6644
03:38:23,300 --> 03:38:24,280
We're gonna go to the side?

6645
03:38:25,160 --> 03:38:25,880
Oh, shit!

6646
03:38:27,340 --> 03:38:28,120
We go up here?

6647
03:38:28,780 --> 03:38:29,140
What?

6648
03:38:29,140 --> 03:38:29,500
Okay.

6649
03:38:30,120 --> 03:38:31,720
Okay, I'm gonna do this here.

6650
03:38:31,820 --> 03:38:32,300
I can't!

6651
03:38:32,400 --> 03:38:33,840
I got bugged!

6652
03:38:34,160 --> 03:38:34,600
Oh no!

6653
03:38:34,800 --> 03:38:35,580
I'm looking back for you!

6654
03:38:35,840 --> 03:38:36,200
No!

6655
03:38:36,220 --> 03:38:37,800
I got bugged!

6656
03:38:37,800 --> 03:38:38,740
Oh!

6657
03:38:39,020 --> 03:38:40,340
I couldn't climb up!

6658
03:38:40,860 --> 03:38:42,160
Do not do anything!

6659
03:38:42,300 --> 03:38:42,800
Just live!

6660
03:38:43,080 --> 03:38:44,280
Remember what we said!

6661
03:38:44,340 --> 03:38:45,100
Just live!

6662
03:38:45,600 --> 03:38:46,440
I'm living!

6663
03:38:46,480 --> 03:38:46,820
I'm living!

6664
03:38:46,900 --> 03:38:48,420
I got bugged!

6665
03:38:48,600 --> 03:38:49,860
I couldn't climb up!

6666
03:38:50,780 --> 03:38:51,260
No!

6667
03:38:54,720 --> 03:38:55,420
Just live!

6668
03:38:55,540 --> 03:38:57,000
Do you remember what I said?

6669
03:38:57,160 --> 03:38:59,000
All you have to do is live!

6670
03:38:59,220 --> 03:39:00,280
Just live!

6671
03:39:01,180 --> 03:39:02,300
Okay, I'm gonna break this.

6672
03:39:02,360 --> 03:39:03,440
I hope I don't die for this.

6673
03:39:06,040 --> 03:39:06,760
There we go.

6674
03:39:06,880 --> 03:39:07,120
Okay.

6675
03:39:10,840 --> 03:39:11,560
I had...

6676
03:39:12,020 --> 03:39:12,380
stuff!

6677
03:39:12,720 --> 03:39:14,440
I don't know what I had, but...

6678
03:39:14,440 --> 03:39:15,760
I want that stuff so bad.

6679
03:39:15,960 --> 03:39:17,000
I don't know if I can get to it, though.

6680
03:39:17,120 --> 03:39:17,500
No, it's okay.

6681
03:39:17,600 --> 03:39:18,300
Just live!

6682
03:39:19,180 --> 03:39:19,900
Just live!

6683
03:39:22,360 --> 03:39:23,580
Oh my god, we're not dead last!

6684
03:39:23,900 --> 03:39:24,660
We're not dead last!

6685
03:39:24,800 --> 03:39:26,580
Oh my god, this is the best we've ever done!

6686
03:39:26,640 --> 03:39:28,620
This is the best we've ever done!

6687
03:39:31,780 --> 03:39:32,740
Just stay there!

6688
03:39:32,780 --> 03:39:34,080
I might die in this routine, though.

6689
03:39:34,180 --> 03:39:36,580
I have, like, such little... I have shock!

6690
03:39:36,820 --> 03:39:38,340
I have one shock thing.

6691
03:39:39,260 --> 03:39:39,560
Oh, you do?

6692
03:39:39,700 --> 03:39:39,940
Okay.

6693
03:39:40,180 --> 03:39:43,060
I think I'm gonna eat Storm.

6694
03:39:45,700 --> 03:39:46,760
Oh, I think they took it.

6695
03:39:47,060 --> 03:39:48,300
Yeah, they definitely grabbed it.

6696
03:39:48,320 --> 03:39:50,100
Like, it's my shock thing now.

6697
03:39:50,500 --> 03:39:52,000
Yeah, I have a shield bubble, too.

6698
03:39:52,080 --> 03:39:52,380
That's why.

6699
03:39:54,860 --> 03:39:55,720
Oh my god.

6700
03:39:55,860 --> 03:39:57,620
Can you afford to eat it?

6701
03:40:00,640 --> 03:40:01,680
Oh, I see someone there.

6702
03:40:03,840 --> 03:40:04,800
Oh my god.

6703
03:40:04,920 --> 03:40:05,080
Whoa!

6704
03:40:09,600 --> 03:40:10,820
That's four, but okay!

6705
03:40:11,300 --> 03:40:12,180
Steal his house!

6706
03:40:12,560 --> 03:40:13,200
We're good!

6707
03:40:14,440 --> 03:40:15,660
You stole his house!

6708
03:40:15,880 --> 03:40:17,160
Oh my god, there's a ship!

6709
03:40:17,200 --> 03:40:18,800
That's what we wanted to do earlier!

6710
03:40:19,140 --> 03:40:19,600
Remember!

6711
03:40:20,360 --> 03:40:21,940
He had two ships!

6712
03:40:23,120 --> 03:40:25,240
I'm gonna go over here?

6713
03:40:25,500 --> 03:40:26,240
I don't know what's happening.

6714
03:40:26,440 --> 03:40:27,180
He has two ships!

6715
03:40:28,120 --> 03:40:29,640
That's what's gonna happen.

6716
03:40:30,580 --> 03:40:31,660
I'm so dead!

6717
03:40:33,320 --> 03:40:34,580
I'm so dead!

6718
03:40:34,580 --> 03:40:36,660
He had two ships!

6719
03:40:36,820 --> 03:40:37,740
That's crazy!

6720
03:40:38,540 --> 03:40:39,060
Damn.

6721
03:40:39,200 --> 03:40:40,580
Oh, I got creeped by a solo!

6722
03:40:41,160 --> 03:40:42,460
Oh my god!

6723
03:40:42,860 --> 03:40:44,720
I should have probably turned to just shoot them.

6724
03:40:46,320 --> 03:40:46,960
Wait, what?

6725
03:40:47,020 --> 03:40:47,960
This guy killed them all?

6726
03:40:48,000 --> 03:40:49,280
Yeah, this guy killed them!

6727
03:40:50,220 --> 03:40:51,060
Holy shit!

6728
03:40:51,060 --> 03:40:52,040
We got twelve!

6729
03:40:53,660 --> 03:40:54,720
Let's fucking go!

6730
03:40:54,820 --> 03:40:55,040
Let's go!

6731
03:40:56,720 --> 03:40:58,300
I knew this record!

6732
03:40:59,140 --> 03:41:01,000
That's the best we've ever done!

6733
03:41:01,200 --> 03:41:02,520
And that's all it matters!

6734
03:41:03,820 --> 03:41:04,560
Let's fucking go!

6735
03:41:04,580 --> 03:41:04,960
You know what's funny?

6736
03:41:05,000 --> 03:41:06,660
We had scuffed loot that game too!

6737
03:41:06,800 --> 03:41:08,580
And we still lived longer than we've been!

6738
03:41:09,680 --> 03:41:11,220
We got a kill as well!

6739
03:41:11,900 --> 03:41:13,000
Yeah, we got a kill!

6740
03:41:13,140 --> 03:41:14,260
We got a twelve life!

6741
03:41:14,920 --> 03:41:16,780
And we get far life!

6742
03:41:16,900 --> 03:41:19,040
Like, oh my god, we get far as well!

6743
03:41:19,300 --> 03:41:21,380
Like, everything's going up for us!

6744
03:41:23,100 --> 03:41:24,900
Oh, wait, you have to be tenth?

6745
03:41:25,240 --> 03:41:27,660
You have to be tenth to get three points.

6746
03:41:28,140 --> 03:41:28,780
Wait, really?

6747
03:41:28,980 --> 03:41:29,180
Boo!

6748
03:41:30,840 --> 03:41:34,560
Yeah, tenth to twentieth is all one point.

6749
03:41:34,580 --> 03:41:35,420
Boo!

6750
03:41:39,140 --> 03:41:41,400
Twelve teams in the last ring.

6751
03:41:41,580 --> 03:41:42,220
That's crazy.

6752
03:41:43,280 --> 03:41:47,020
Hey, imagine playing a game competitively with all these bugs.

6753
03:41:47,320 --> 03:41:48,220
Hey, imagine playing a game competitively with all these bugs.

6754
03:41:48,220 --> 03:41:48,720
Oh my god.

6755
03:41:50,140 --> 03:41:51,980
Like, I got stuck in the climb.

6756
03:41:52,160 --> 03:41:53,540
Like, I got stuck in the climb.

6757
03:41:53,540 --> 03:41:55,020
Yeah, was your character teleporting?

6758
03:41:55,100 --> 03:41:57,860
They kept pushing me back.

6759
03:41:58,480 --> 03:42:01,100
I had that bug happening too when I was trying to do it.

6760
03:42:01,180 --> 03:42:02,900
I got super lucky when I jumped around.

6761
03:42:02,900 --> 03:42:04,720
But otherwise, I was like...

6762
03:42:04,720 --> 03:42:06,860
I was afraid I was going to suffer the same death too.

6763
03:42:07,080 --> 03:42:08,000
Yeah, I was like, nooo!

6764
03:42:08,460 --> 03:42:09,260
I got stuck!

6765
03:42:09,440 --> 03:42:10,460
I couldn't go back!

6766
03:42:13,680 --> 03:42:15,060
Yo, Porta Bunker City?

6767
03:42:15,280 --> 03:42:16,600
Oh my god, this is my favorite.

6768
03:42:16,600 --> 03:42:17,760
There's so many Porta Bunkers.

6769
03:42:18,500 --> 03:42:19,500
Oh my god, how are they going to get out?

6770
03:42:19,500 --> 03:42:19,980
Is Mr. Beast here?

6771
03:42:20,980 --> 03:42:24,040
Oh my god, all I hear is just gunshots and Porta...

6772
03:42:24,040 --> 03:42:26,220
Oh my god, look at all these free real estates!

6773
03:42:26,520 --> 03:42:27,440
Oh my god!

6774
03:42:27,640 --> 03:42:29,960
Look at all these free real estates though!

6775
03:42:34,760 --> 03:42:39,160
I like how Zero Build turns into the same exact thing that Build Mode does.

6776
03:42:39,380 --> 03:42:40,100
I like how Zero Build turns into the same exact thing that Build Mode does.

6777
03:42:40,100 --> 03:42:41,400
Because there's so many bunkers.

6778
03:42:41,780 --> 03:42:43,240
Oh my god, he's 1 HP.

6779
03:42:43,920 --> 03:42:45,720
He literally got hit one...

6780
03:42:45,720 --> 03:42:46,460
Oh, there he goes.

6781
03:42:48,620 --> 03:42:49,440
Where's his teammate?

6782
03:42:49,900 --> 03:42:50,860
Oh, there he is.

6783
03:42:50,860 --> 03:42:52,080
His teammate is just flying up.

6784
03:42:52,920 --> 03:42:54,740
Can't hit him if he's just flying!

6785
03:42:56,260 --> 03:42:57,400
And he died to zone.

6786
03:42:59,480 --> 03:43:01,380
He died to zone!

6787
03:43:01,380 --> 03:43:01,480
He died to zone!

6788
03:43:03,180 --> 03:43:03,740
Oh my god!

6789
03:43:03,740 --> 03:43:05,400
I watched a guy just stay in the...

6790
03:43:05,400 --> 03:43:06,460
You know, like Valkalp?

6791
03:43:06,860 --> 03:43:09,140
He did that, and then he fucking...

6792
03:43:09,620 --> 03:43:12,120
He just stayed in the zone and died to zone.

6793
03:43:12,540 --> 03:43:14,780
Oh my god, I wonder if anyone...

6794
03:43:14,780 --> 03:43:17,340
No one has Shockwave and done the Magneto Gloves up.

6795
03:43:18,980 --> 03:43:19,940
This guy lost that.

6796
03:43:20,900 --> 03:43:21,780
Oh shit.

6797
03:43:23,540 --> 03:43:24,660
I think it's like...

6798
03:43:24,660 --> 03:43:25,900
Oh, it's too late.

6799
03:43:26,080 --> 03:43:29,200
It's 3 teams, so it's a solo and 2 duos.

6800
03:43:29,200 --> 03:43:29,240
Yeah.

6801
03:43:29,520 --> 03:43:29,940
Ugh.

6802
03:43:30,440 --> 03:43:31,460
Oh, now it's a solo and 2 duos.

6803
03:43:31,480 --> 03:43:32,920
Wait, no, 1v1?

6804
03:43:33,120 --> 03:43:33,740
Yeah, it's a 1v1.

6805
03:43:33,840 --> 03:43:35,280
Oh my god, 12 HP.

6806
03:43:35,440 --> 03:43:35,920
12 HP!

6807
03:43:36,260 --> 03:43:36,720
He died to zone.

6808
03:43:36,980 --> 03:43:38,220
It would be so funny.

6809
03:43:38,820 --> 03:43:39,760
Oh my god!

6810
03:43:40,180 --> 03:43:42,300
Dude, this guy panicked.

6811
03:43:43,760 --> 03:43:44,640
Oh no!

6812
03:43:44,840 --> 03:43:45,740
God damn it!

6813
03:43:47,520 --> 03:43:50,260
It would have been so funny though if he died to zone.

6814
03:43:53,080 --> 03:43:54,300
Rest in pupper.

6815
03:43:54,380 --> 03:43:56,800
Guys, we're getting... we're already winning, guys.

6816
03:43:57,260 --> 03:43:58,780
Wait, that was our biggest game!

6817
03:43:59,000 --> 03:43:59,260
Yeah!

6818
03:43:59,840 --> 03:44:01,460
Well, to be fair, we didn't get...

6819
03:44:01,480 --> 03:44:04,120
extra points for it because you don't get points until 10th place.

6820
03:44:04,660 --> 03:44:07,140
Hey, Noah, morally, we got 12.

6821
03:44:07,860 --> 03:44:09,640
Morally, we did better.

6822
03:44:09,840 --> 03:44:10,780
Yeah, we did better.

6823
03:44:12,120 --> 03:44:15,120
We're getting far, guys!

6824
03:44:15,920 --> 03:44:17,620
I'm getting far tonight.

6825
03:44:17,720 --> 03:44:18,260
Let's go!

6826
03:44:18,660 --> 03:44:20,220
We're all getting far!

6827
03:44:20,580 --> 03:44:21,740
Let's fucking go!

6828
03:44:23,040 --> 03:44:26,500
Okay, do you feel following vehicle mod is too weak?

6829
03:44:26,580 --> 03:44:27,680
Yes, too fucking weak.

6830
03:44:28,480 --> 03:44:29,340
Wait, for which one?

6831
03:44:29,340 --> 03:44:31,160
Oh, I got the we want your feedback.

6832
03:44:34,660 --> 03:44:37,080
Yeah, tell us how good that match was.

6833
03:44:37,160 --> 03:44:38,220
On a scale of 1 to 10.

6834
03:44:38,440 --> 03:44:41,200
I voted all ones, so they'll buff it.

6835
03:44:41,540 --> 03:44:44,180
It was like, what's your feeling about this particular gun?

6836
03:44:44,300 --> 03:44:45,040
And I said it sucked.

6837
03:44:45,320 --> 03:44:47,720
So that means they're gonna buff it because of my input.

6838
03:44:50,100 --> 03:44:51,400
Guys, guys, guys.

6839
03:44:51,520 --> 03:44:53,980
We got... we got Doki feedback.

6840
03:44:54,740 --> 03:44:55,880
We gotta do it.

6841
03:44:56,740 --> 03:44:57,720
Gotta do it.

6842
03:44:58,060 --> 03:44:58,500
Alright.

6843
03:44:58,540 --> 03:44:59,660
I wanna see the final placements.

6844
03:44:59,720 --> 03:45:01,620
I think we got, like, 19th, right?

6845
03:45:01,800 --> 03:45:02,500
I think.

6846
03:45:02,680 --> 03:45:03,600
18th or 19th.

6847
03:45:03,680 --> 03:45:06,640
We got either 18th or 19th because we're definitely not 20th.

6848
03:45:06,820 --> 03:45:07,760
Top 20th!

6849
03:45:07,800 --> 03:45:08,200
Let's go!

6850
03:45:08,380 --> 03:45:10,000
We're definitely not 20th.

6851
03:45:15,500 --> 03:45:16,380
Doki, I'm proud of us.

6852
03:45:16,380 --> 03:45:17,280
That's all that matters.

6853
03:45:17,540 --> 03:45:18,060
Me too.

6854
03:45:18,160 --> 03:45:18,700
I'm proud of us.

6855
03:45:18,700 --> 03:45:18,720
I'm proud of us.

6856
03:45:18,720 --> 03:45:20,480
Our vibes were more immaculate than every other team.

6857
03:45:20,480 --> 03:45:23,160
Yeah, we had the best vibes and we weren't last.

6858
03:45:23,840 --> 03:45:25,980
And who... what other team runs a candy cane?

6859
03:45:26,160 --> 03:45:27,780
We literally beat Overwatch players.

6860
03:45:28,020 --> 03:45:29,140
Like, Overwatch pros.

6861
03:45:29,620 --> 03:45:30,040
Like...

6862
03:45:31,940 --> 03:45:32,900
Yeah, what are they...

6863
03:45:32,900 --> 03:45:33,940
What are they diamonding?

6864
03:45:34,060 --> 03:45:35,600
What are they trying to be masters of?

6865
03:45:36,200 --> 03:45:37,140
You know what's funny?

6866
03:45:37,300 --> 03:45:38,920
They're watching the...

6867
03:45:38,920 --> 03:45:41,520
They're watching, like, Overwatch gameplay now.

6868
03:45:41,640 --> 03:45:42,800
They're, like, so checked.

6869
03:45:42,880 --> 03:45:44,560
They're not... they're not...

6870
03:45:44,560 --> 03:45:45,260
Are they really?

6871
03:45:45,540 --> 03:45:47,700
They've already swapped to Overwatch.

6872
03:45:48,540 --> 03:45:49,600
Wait, what was their name again?

6873
03:45:49,600 --> 03:45:50,160
Just J3?

6874
03:45:50,260 --> 03:45:50,980
J3, yeah.

6875
03:45:51,120 --> 03:45:53,800
He's doing a... he's doing, like, watching the tournament.

6876
03:45:54,120 --> 03:45:55,220
I thought it was funny.

6877
03:45:56,380 --> 03:45:57,800
Yeah, you were not kidding.

6878
03:45:57,940 --> 03:45:59,480
He's like, alright, time to watch some Overwatch.

6879
03:46:02,400 --> 03:46:04,100
Hey, we shot our gun!

6880
03:46:04,860 --> 03:46:05,740
We did!

6881
03:46:06,100 --> 03:46:06,540
We shot our gun!

6882
03:46:06,780 --> 03:46:07,940
You got the kill, Doki!

6883
03:46:08,720 --> 03:46:09,660
Doki, you got that.

6884
03:46:09,660 --> 03:46:10,480
I got a kill!

6885
03:46:11,000 --> 03:46:12,340
I shot my gun!

6886
03:46:12,920 --> 03:46:13,580
That was you.

6887
03:46:13,660 --> 03:46:14,580
And then I got stuck.

6888
03:46:16,640 --> 03:46:18,880
That's what happens when you stop hiding in bushes.

6889
03:46:19,300 --> 03:46:21,720
You died to a competitive Polish game.

6890
03:46:23,980 --> 03:46:25,880
I can't believe we did it, Doki!

6891
03:46:26,700 --> 03:46:29,180
We didn't end in dead last!

6892
03:46:29,340 --> 03:46:30,680
That's a huge win!

6893
03:46:30,760 --> 03:46:31,920
Against Fortnite pros?

6894
03:46:32,080 --> 03:46:33,080
Let's fucking go!

6895
03:46:33,900 --> 03:46:37,740
You know, if you think about it, we were going against all top pros.

6896
03:46:38,100 --> 03:46:38,760
Yeah, exactly.

6897
03:46:38,820 --> 03:46:40,540
That was so fucked up for us.

6898
03:46:40,560 --> 03:46:43,480
We ended in 18th or 19th.

6899
03:46:43,480 --> 03:46:46,200
That was so fucked for us, honestly, like...

6900
03:46:46,780 --> 03:46:47,860
I'm proud of us.

6901
03:46:47,880 --> 03:46:49,700
How we were treated there, like...

6902
03:46:50,660 --> 03:46:52,120
We just built Diffy.

6903
03:46:53,280 --> 03:46:54,360
Not last!

6904
03:46:54,840 --> 03:46:55,040
Woo!

6905
03:46:55,920 --> 03:46:57,480
Let's go, Doki!

6906
03:46:57,820 --> 03:46:59,720
Yeah, GG's!

6907
03:46:59,720 --> 03:47:06,380
Dori, thanks for dropping by super last minute to be my duo.

6908
03:47:06,960 --> 03:47:08,900
Thank you for considering me.

6909
03:47:09,460 --> 03:47:10,160
Had a great time.

6910
03:47:10,160 --> 03:47:12,260
Had a great time.

6911
03:47:12,700 --> 03:47:16,900
I don't remember the last time I laughed this much when I was playing a game.

6912
03:47:18,640 --> 03:47:20,760
It's only been pain without you, Doki.

6913
03:47:25,680 --> 03:47:26,160
GG's!

6914
03:47:26,160 --> 03:47:27,360
No, I had so much fun, though.

6915
03:47:27,440 --> 03:47:28,460
Thank you for the games.

6916
03:47:28,680 --> 03:47:29,080
Yeah!

6917
03:47:29,260 --> 03:47:30,080
Thank you!

6918
03:47:30,380 --> 03:47:32,080
I can't believe... Oh my god, they went so...

6919
03:47:32,080 --> 03:47:34,780
We've been playing Fortnite for almost four hours.

6920
03:47:34,840 --> 03:47:35,700
Holy fuck.

6921
03:47:35,980 --> 03:47:39,360
Oh my... Doki, you're a certified Fortnite streamer now.

6922
03:47:39,420 --> 03:47:39,860
Oh god, no.

6923
03:47:40,440 --> 03:47:45,540
Guys, if you're... Guys, hey, as a certified Fortnite streamer, please use my creator code.

6924
03:47:46,900 --> 03:47:49,660
My creator code is supportacreatordokibird.

6925
03:47:50,860 --> 03:47:53,200
If you don't use it, then we're not gonna get a Doki skin.

6926
03:47:53,560 --> 03:47:54,140
Yeah, guys.

6927
03:47:54,380 --> 03:47:58,880
The more you use my creator code, the more chances I can get a Doki skin, guys.

6928
03:47:59,260 --> 03:48:01,380
Guys, just think about the Doki skin, guys.

6929
03:48:06,220 --> 03:48:06,660
GG's!

6930
03:48:07,020 --> 03:48:07,500
GG's, Dori!

6931
03:48:08,220 --> 03:48:10,040
I am gonna peace out now.

6932
03:48:10,900 --> 03:48:12,520
Alright, I'll catch you...

6933
03:48:12,520 --> 03:48:14,820
maybe not another three years.

6934
03:48:15,920 --> 03:48:16,360
Alright.

6935
03:48:16,900 --> 03:48:17,900
Bye, Dori-u!

6936
03:48:18,160 --> 03:48:19,140
Alright, bye, Doki!

6937
03:48:19,660 --> 03:48:20,140
Bye!

6938
03:48:21,600 --> 03:48:22,520
Alright, guys.

6939
03:48:22,940 --> 03:48:23,640
I'm tired.

6940
03:48:25,000 --> 03:48:26,980
I've been taking...

6941
03:48:26,980 --> 03:48:28,880
This is like an unintentional rest week.

6942
03:48:29,080 --> 03:48:30,600
But like, it's been nice, though.

6943
03:48:30,680 --> 03:48:37,360
Being able to, like, rest and relax this coming week and just chill.

6944
03:48:37,580 --> 03:48:38,500
It's been great!

6945
03:48:38,620 --> 03:48:43,380
I had a great time just chilling and hey, like just being relaxed.

6946
03:48:43,500 --> 03:48:44,740
Other than the Twitch Rivals part.

6947
03:48:44,880 --> 03:48:45,120
But...

6948
03:48:46,900 --> 03:48:50,100
But right after the streams, I usually just like...

6949
03:48:50,600 --> 03:48:54,780
Not checked out, but like I'm just zoned out and just like taking a nice break.

6950
03:48:54,980 --> 03:48:56,920
And touching grass now, so...

6951
03:48:56,920 --> 03:48:57,740
It's been good.

6952
03:48:57,860 --> 03:49:00,800
I think it's been very healthy for me, like mentally, too, and physically.

6953
03:49:01,440 --> 03:49:02,720
I've been walking a lot.

6954
03:49:05,100 --> 03:49:08,580
I've been... I've been walking a lot, so it's been really nice.

6955
03:49:08,840 --> 03:49:09,380
Hey, guys!

6956
03:49:09,440 --> 03:49:12,960
For those who are new here, my name is DokiBird.

6957
03:49:13,060 --> 03:49:15,940
I usually stream on the YouTubes, but...

6958
03:49:16,420 --> 03:49:19,600
Like I said, for Twitch Rivals stuff, I stream on Twitch.

6959
03:49:20,540 --> 03:49:24,880
So, if you want to check and know when I'm going to be streaming on Twitch, please follow me on Twitter.

6960
03:49:26,420 --> 03:49:27,560
It's also DokiBird.

6961
03:49:27,660 --> 03:49:29,740
I think the majority of my socials is DokiBird.

6962
03:49:29,860 --> 03:49:33,120
If you want to support me via other means, feel free to...

6963
03:49:34,600 --> 03:49:35,660
Check my merch!

6964
03:49:35,880 --> 03:49:36,520
Buy my merch!

6965
03:49:37,200 --> 03:49:40,200
Or use my Gamersubs code or my Fortnite code!

6966
03:49:40,660 --> 03:49:42,360
There's so many different ways to support me!

6967
03:49:42,360 --> 03:49:43,240
Or hide it!

6968
03:49:43,280 --> 03:49:44,520
My new PC sub!

6969
03:49:46,280 --> 03:49:47,000
Anyway, guys.

6970
03:49:47,200 --> 03:49:48,320
Thank you all for the subs.

6971
03:49:48,480 --> 03:49:49,380
Thank you all for the bitties.

6972
03:49:49,520 --> 03:49:50,980
Thank you all for the follows.

6973
03:49:51,140 --> 03:49:52,440
I really, really do appreciate it.

6974
03:49:52,520 --> 03:49:57,600
I hope you guys enjoyed watching Fortnite Twitch Rivals of us just fucking around most of the time.

6975
03:49:57,620 --> 03:49:59,120
I'm going to get some pho after this.

6976
03:49:59,300 --> 03:49:59,540
I'm...

6977
03:50:00,520 --> 03:50:01,760
I'm definitely going to get some pho.

6978
03:50:01,760 --> 03:50:02,340
I'm so hungry.

6979
03:50:02,860 --> 03:50:07,500
But as always, everybody, stay hydrated, posture check, get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

6980
03:50:07,580 --> 03:50:09,420
And if you stayed up for me, head to bed!

6981
03:50:09,640 --> 03:50:10,820
Because you deserve it!

6982
03:50:10,920 --> 03:50:11,820
I'll see you guys next time, everybody!

6983
03:50:12,360 --> 03:50:12,960
Bye, guys!

6984
03:50:13,800 --> 03:50:14,360
Bye!
