54
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:58,170
streamed in like so long i don't even honestly i don't even
remember how to do all of this like i don't even know i had

55
00:09:58,170 --> 00:10:11,250
to plug in my four to five year old PC to get all my old old
graphics and everything because I I and then I had to plug

56
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:21,450
in some fucking Overwatch keyboard just to be like because I
was the only keyboard with a cable it was so dusty it was

57
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:28,090
like that keyboard was like seven years old I it was it was
a lot it was It was a lot.

58
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:32,390
It's like, I was like, where, what?

59
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:35,750
I didn't even organize any of those files.

60
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:38,950
It was just all in one download file.

61
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:40,750
I was like, it was in a download.

62
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:49,910
Okay, everything, I put everything in a downloads folder
because back then, four years ago, Doki, never give a fuck

63
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:51,130
about organizing anything.

64
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:54,470
So everything was just in a folder called downloads.

65
00:10:55,090 --> 00:11:03,810
So then I was like, what the fuck did I used so i had to
deal with that for a bit and then and then i was like oh my

66
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:17,410
oh my god okay it was just oh my god and then all these new
technology god i'm oh my god this girl got potential thank

67
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:34,210

um, it's just, it's a lot.

68
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:40,850
I really, I saw how many people were in the waiting room,
and I was like, oh, fuck, okay.

69
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:46,830
I haven't, like, talked to this many people in so long.

70
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:51,570
I, all right, you guys want to know my schedule before then?

71
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:54,050
This was my schedule before then.

72
00:11:57,110 --> 00:11:57,990
7 p.m.

73
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:06,690
I wake up It's 7 p.m.

74
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:23,030

00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:24,610
I eat dinner

76
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:33,850
And then I play until I'm so fucking tired that I pass out.

77
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:39,870
That was the most healthiest schedule I had for almost a
month straight.

78
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:40,610
Wasn't that?

79
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:52,490
And so what I saw, I saw was like, oh my god, now it's it.

80
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:54,970
Don't make it depressing.

81
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:56,830

00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:36,290

91
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:38,430
So.

92
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:39,310
Anyway.

93
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:42,070
I came back from therapy.

94
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:44,810
And then my therapist was like.

95
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:45,810

00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:55,990
Yeah, I got 32 days together.

101
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:01,460
I was like...

102
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:03,860
Yeah.

103
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,940

00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:09,360
I can do stuff now.

105
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,080
So...

106
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,860
And then...

107
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:15,380

108
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:17,520

I'm streaming today.

111
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:23,400
And then he was like...

112
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:31,260
And he was like, wow, you know, like, I can tell you have
it, you're grounded now.

113
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:34,260
And it's like, it's like you have a purpose.

114
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:36,500
And like, he's right.

115
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:38,760
Because like, I can stream now.

116
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:47,720
I have, okay, I actually, even though now it's a serious
note, that is my segue to the serious note thing.

117
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:51,780
But basically, I do have a, I have a purpose now.

118
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:52,540
I do.

119
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:59,720
I'm not playing video games until clicking 11 in the morning
anymore.

120
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:02,980
I actually have stuff I want to do again.

121
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:04,160
I actually have goals.

122
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,700
I actually have things I want to do.

123
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:08,660
Things I want to play.

124
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:11,080
Things I want to plan.

125
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:12,800
It's actually crazy.

126
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:14,300
The moment.

127
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:17,140
The moment I was finally free.

128
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:21,640
Like, I have so many ideas in my mind.

129
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:23,340
And I was so happy.

130
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:24,940
Okay, I was not so happy.

131
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:26,520
Okay, I cried.

132
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,860
I shouldn't say I was so happy.

133
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:35,040
I was like, I was happier than what I was a month ago.

134
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,380
That's for sure.

135
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:37,720
I was happier.

136
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:38,880
Anyway.

137
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:44,600
I was, I actually have a vision and everything.

138
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,260
So like, he wasn't wrong.

139
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:56,380
Like, instead of not knowing what my life was going to be,
at least now, I know where my life is going to be now so he

140
00:15:56,380 --> 00:16:10,400
was right and then and then he was like so like how's your
channel i was like oh like i got 300 key subscribers in two

141
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:18,330
days he's like what the it was like what

142
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:27,010
I didn't...

143
00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:27,250
Okay.

144
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:28,910
Yeah.

145
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:31,490
And he was like...

146
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:32,370
That's insane!

147
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:34,310
I was like...

148
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:34,770
Yeah.

149
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:40,630
But...

150
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:41,030
Yeah.

151
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:44,030
Um...

152
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:45,010
So...

153
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:46,070
It is actually...

154
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:48,210
Honestly...

155
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:49,070
It's...

156
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:50,690
What...

157
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:51,990
Looking forward...

158
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:53,430
In the future...

159
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:55,370
The future plans...

zero profit last year because I spent it all it's just like

$200,000.

205
00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:14,610
I was so, it just blew my mind.

206
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:18,270
I, I blew my mind.

207
00:23:18,410 --> 00:23:21,070
I couldn't, I couldn't believe it.

208
00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:28,390

I didn't expect really.

228
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:29,950
I felt like it was like, you know, end of the world.

229
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:34,170
It's hard to be hopeful after what happened, you know?

230
00:26:34,330 --> 00:26:35,070
It's hard.

231
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:37,670
It's hard to be hopeful.

232
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:51,930
I honestly, but then, then I saw so many support and all the
love and all the messages I got throughout the past two days

I like it when it's not landscape.

272
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:27,540
But like, you know the square?

273
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:29,400
I don't know how to describe it.

274
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,660
You know, the square shape instead of the landscape.

275
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:32,280
It's not...

276
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:33,120
Was it full square?

277
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:33,720

278
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:34,740

281
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:42,220
I'm trying to choose words carefully.

282
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:46,320
Because, like, I don't know what vocabulary it is anymore.

283
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:48,620
Portrait.

284
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:50,460
But it's not full portrait.

285
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:51,280
It's, like, somewhere.

286
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:52,100

287
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:54,200

00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,400
Like, I know there was a lot of landscape ones.

290
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:02,180

291
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,940
Was it full portrait?

292
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:05,060
Size dimensions?

00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:20,340
Yeah, I actually, yeah, I actually, I was like, one, like,
the first people that, like, discovered it and, like,

321
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:24,620
tweeted out and stuff for everybody, um, to, like, introduce
it.

322
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:29,780
I deleted, okay, a lot, there's, like, at a certain year,
like, a lot of those tweets are, like, it, my, if you, like,

323
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:35,620
look through my tweet history now, it's, like, at this time,
it stops at a certain time of year, because, obviously,

324
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:39,700
Everything fucking down there is all gone now.

325
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:40,720
Oh my god.

326
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,040

Yeah.

330
00:36:48,480 --> 00:37:04,380
And, uh, I remember, uh, I think I wasn't like, I was always
interested in like YouTubing and everything and, um, I

331
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:04,840
remember.

332
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:19,740
You know, I actually, uh, was one of the first, like, couple
of, like, one of the earliest, um, Iron Vertex, like,

333
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:21,860
customers back then.

334
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:23,420
Super early.

335
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,220
Super duper early.

336
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:36,080
Like, back when V-Tubing wasn't, like, like, super big yet,
and it is actually, yeah, yeah.

Yeah, you might, I don't even know if you can, I'm pretty
sure you can still find, find like me on, on like one of

338
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:49,460

391
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:24,080
if you just send me some hate mail like i've you know i've
already been through a lot so i don't think um i'm literally

393
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:37,220

or like what he really thinks about me so

394
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:52,540
so uh so yes anyway i like how all i wrote was birthday i i

397
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:31,020

doky doge doky doge Which came first?

398
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:32,940
Of course I love my...

399
00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:34,660
Well...

400
00:45:34,660 --> 00:45:35,920
Now I love myself again.

401
00:45:38,020 --> 00:45:39,260
We gotta be realistic here.

402
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:45,680
I love myself again.

403
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:47,200
So...

404
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:48,440
But back then...

405
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:49,880
I really loved myself.

406
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:51,160
So...

407
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:52,660
When I got Doki Doge...

408
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:54,680
I named him after me.

409
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:55,820
So...

410
00:45:55,820 --> 00:45:56,600
...

411
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:56,760
...

412
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:04,700
But then, it might get a little confusing.

413
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:11,780
So, because, you know, Doki, Doki Doge, it might get a
little bit confusing.

414
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:14,420
Also, there's like, it's just too many Ds.

415
00:46:15,580 --> 00:46:22,740
So, we might give him a little nickname just to distinguish
between Doki 1 and Doki 2.

416
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:29,640
And I'm very willing to let you guys decide what...

417
00:46:29,660 --> 00:46:32,520
Do-Kidoge's nickname is.

418
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:35,780
So you guys can decide.

419
00:46:36,260 --> 00:46:37,440
Do-Kidoge nickname.

420
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:39,500
Guys.

421
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:41,420
You guys can decide.

422
00:46:42,340 --> 00:46:43,040
Oh my god.

423
00:46:43,260 --> 00:46:43,920
Don't be so.

424
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:49,140
Guys.

425
00:46:50,470 --> 00:46:51,620
I'm trying to like.

426
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:52,460
Guys.

427
00:46:52,740 --> 00:46:54,340
You guys can decide.

428
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:56,380
Do-Kidoge nickname.

429
00:46:56,620 --> 00:46:57,400
That I'll be using.

430
00:46:57,900 --> 00:46:58,640
On stream.

431
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:00,780
Just so we can distinguish.

432
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:01,200
Which.

433
00:47:01,220 --> 00:47:04,380
Doki 1 and Doki 2.

434
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:06,180
Oh my god!

435
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:07,720
Amused Glacier!

436
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:10,480
What a great suggestion.

437
00:47:14,820 --> 00:47:16,880
Through random picking.

438
00:47:19,820 --> 00:47:23,220
sheer randomness and random picking.

439
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:37,680
I feel like, I don't know, I feel like, for some reason, we
could call him Doki Ember Doge Oh no Thank you Glacier I

440
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:46,260
just closed my eyes and like Picked one name on random But
like it's spelled with an A Just so you guys know It's Doki

441
00:47:46,260 --> 00:47:49,800
Ember Doge What's this?

442
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:54,720
Oh sorry that's Twitch alert Because I haven't set up
YouTube alerts yet I haven't

443
00:47:59,580 --> 00:48:08,400
So you can called doki doge amber if you like also like it
helps out because i don't really don't want to say doki doge

444
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:19,140
or doki a lot so his middle name is now uh doki amber doge
amber for sure so and he and i feel like he's like super

445
00:48:19,140 --> 00:48:20,860
used to it anyway at this point

446
00:48:29,470 --> 00:48:38,110
um anyway this is how scuffed it was i didn't even but i
didn't even set up like youtube alerts because i was like

447
00:48:38,110 --> 00:48:47,470
i'm not even monetized so i'll just set up twitch alerts
like i mean i had twitch alerts so i was just like just

448
00:48:47,470 --> 00:49:01,150
whenever i got monetized i'll figure that stuff out later um
yay tags i really i was i don't know the only one i have so

449
00:49:01,150 --> 00:49:13,410
far Doki Gallery, I didn't want to put art on there because,
I don't know, by, for some reason, I realized, I don't know,

450
00:49:13,490 --> 00:49:23,810
from research, I guess, that when you put art in any art
tag, like the word art in there, it, um, oh my god, dad.

451
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:46,670
um it gives you like you know a lot of like nfts and and
bots so by sheer research and i don't know maybe wow maybe

452
00:49:46,670 --> 00:50:02,470
some like it came to me in a dream i realized that i'm never
using art for an art tag ever again so so our our uh our our

453
00:50:02,470 --> 00:50:11,270
art tag is jokie gallery uh we're gonna have i guess like
tag suggestion you know what we're just gonna do it to the

454
00:50:11,270 --> 00:50:19,390
point because we're retiring this tag anyway but any for any
tag suggestions and names feel oh my gosh feels i might make

455
00:50:19,390 --> 00:50:24,530
some funny faces while i'm typing just so you guys know um
oh my god dad sorry

456
00:50:29,570 --> 00:50:43,590
tag suggestions all right tag suggestions um let's see i
don't know hashtag dokey tag suggestions

457
00:50:47,240 --> 00:51:05,560
all right if you want to suggest tags it is hashtag dokey
tags tag suggestions there we go so like you know uh like

458
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:20,900
the usual tags i guess like live tag memes tag um i forgot
i'm sorry it's please give me it's been a month plus it's

459
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:23,220
actually it's been so long

460
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:33,100
this this is so long i i was like fuck what what do we use
for tags again.

461
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:37,660
I just remembered the live tag, the memes tag, the, oh,
shrine!

462
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:38,600
Yes!

463
00:51:39,740 --> 00:51:41,240
We're bringing back the shrine.

464
00:51:43,020 --> 00:51:43,840
Oh, doki shrine.

465
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,520
I'm just gonna, this is to the point.

466
00:51:45,740 --> 00:51:47,540
I swear to God, if someone already has doki.

467
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:57,760
I, this is the worst part because it's like, doki is like,
it's like a real word, so it's like, it's like a real word.

468
00:51:57,840 --> 00:52:06,060
So I feel like someone already at use, guys, don't use doki
that doki stride is a natural real tag because it makes

469
00:52:06,060 --> 00:52:08,320
sense when you put it together so

470
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:27,080
so give a shrine tag somewhere um uh oh where was i where
was i where was i where was i uh fuck okay uh

471
00:52:30,180 --> 00:52:39,140
My brain is like on cogwheels right now Trying to get back
into the groove of things Because it's like I had a system

472
00:52:39,140 --> 00:52:46,380
of everything Oh wait no I already finished everything I

489
00:54:37,820 --> 00:54:38,440
my culture.

490
00:54:40,100 --> 00:54:43,080
And the holiday really does mean a lot to me.

491
00:54:44,420 --> 00:54:45,620
It really does mean a lot to me.

492
00:54:46,340 --> 00:54:51,580
And it's the year of, you know, of new beginnings.

493
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:59,140
So, I was going to save this on Lunar New Year, but then I
was just like, I just want to spoil you guys a little bit.

494
00:54:59,820 --> 00:55:07,310
So, we will be having Lunar New Year merch, which will come
out on Lunar New Year.

495
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:10,620
And...

496
00:55:13,580 --> 00:55:14,160

00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:29,880
It's not finished yet.

501
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,000
It's still a draft.

502
00:55:31,140 --> 00:55:31,820
It's still a draft.

503
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:38,380
But this is one of the Lunar New Year merch that I'm going
to be selling.

504
00:55:39,140 --> 00:55:40,660
And there's one more.

505
00:55:40,980 --> 00:55:44,760
I'm really, really, really excited about this one I'm super
happy about.

506
00:55:44,860 --> 00:55:45,660
This is a little preview.

507
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:49,060
But I will have some Red Pocket Evolopes!

508
00:55:50,220 --> 00:55:50,920
It's a little preview!

509
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:52,840
Oh my god!

510
00:55:53,180 --> 00:55:53,960
It's so cute.

511
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:54,380
Oh my gosh.

512
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:56,920
When you see the full illustrations, it's like actually...

513
00:55:58,160 --> 00:55:58,700
I'm...

514
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:03,940
I cannot wait, but we're gonna have Red Pocket Envelopes,
too.

515
00:56:04,780 --> 00:56:09,860
This is, obviously, it's just a little preview, so when, you
know, during Lunar New Year, when, you know, whoa, you get

516
00:56:09,860 --> 00:56:10,700
to see the whole thing!

517
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:11,320
Whoa!

518
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:16,220
But we're gonna have a three-pack of some Lunar New Year
envelopes.

519
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:19,660
So, you can use it to...

520
00:56:20,420 --> 00:56:24,200
Honestly, like, honestly, the best advice is to, like, never
get married.

521
00:56:24,340 --> 00:56:27,840
So, you can always receive Red Pocket Envelopes.

522
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:32,660
So, honestly, just keep it for display, Because why the fuck
would you want to give money to little kids?

523
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:33,280
Like...

524
00:56:39,140 --> 00:56:42,520
Because I was a little kid back then, too.

525
00:56:43,540 --> 00:56:46,100
And I was a little kid back then, too.

526
00:56:46,460 --> 00:56:49,900
And I abused the shit of the Lunar New Year system.

527
00:56:50,340 --> 00:56:55,440
As in, I would go and hang out at my grandpa's place.

528
00:56:55,820 --> 00:56:58,020
Because he was the head of the family.

529
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,640
In Lunar New Year.

530
00:57:02,700 --> 00:57:04,840
In Lunar New Year.

531
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:05,860
In China.

532
00:57:07,020 --> 00:57:10,020
You have to go to the head of the family.

533
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:12,380
Like place.

534
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:13,940
And pay your respect.

535
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:16,060
So I would stay there overnight.

536
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:22,460
I would stay there overnight.

537
00:57:22,900 --> 00:57:23,480
And because.

538
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:26,560
I was the first.

539
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:27,940
Granddaughter.

540
00:57:28,780 --> 00:57:29,180
Um.

541
00:57:29,660 --> 00:57:29,980
That.

542
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:36,640
has the that was my dad like you know because you know my
dad's a man so

543
00:57:40,180 --> 00:57:44,260
so i have his last name mr bird

544
00:57:49,480 --> 00:58:03,460
i'd get more money and and that's how you cheese the system
make sure go to make sure you go to the head of the family's

545
00:58:03,460 --> 00:58:13,800
place stay overnight never get married so you can get more
money and never have to give away money there you go just be

546
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:27,820
born and be born first no no no no born first but for your
dad's side and that's how you do it as long as as long as

547
00:58:27,820 --> 00:58:40,300
you do that he has so much money you got so much money and
go to every family dinner make sure you go to every single

548
00:58:40,300 --> 00:58:48,060
family dinner because sometimes they forgot they gave you
this gave you an envelope already so sometimes they forget

549
00:58:48,060 --> 00:58:56,920
to give you an envelope already so they give it to you again
because they give so many envelopes they actually forget um

550
00:58:56,920 --> 00:59:04,360
and then you have to make sure If you are the firstborn,
firstborn grandchildren, make sure you tell them that

551
00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:07,300
because they'll be like, oh my god, that's Toki.

552
00:59:08,340 --> 00:59:09,140
That's Mr. Bird.

553
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:14,340
That's Grandpa Bird's firstborn grand-granddaughter.

554
00:59:15,240 --> 00:59:17,780
We gotta give her the bigger ones.

555
00:59:24,420 --> 00:59:25,040
Genius!

556
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,920
But Toki, what if I'm not the firstborn?

557
00:59:27,940 --> 00:59:39,580
firstborn you will be soon because they'll have to get
married if you never get married one day you will become

558
00:59:39,580 --> 00:59:49,700
then you move up if you never get married the the firstborn
would have to get married so you become the firstborn so

559
00:59:49,700 --> 00:59:58,000
their firstborn money will go to you there you go and That's
why you should never get married If you celebrate Lunar New

560
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:06,000
Year Because I don't know, some people might have been like
But Doki, I don't celebrate Lunar New Year I was gonna say

561
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:20,860
like That just sucks for you At that point, I don't know
Sorry, I don't know Like if you don't celebrate Lunar New

562
01:00:20,860 --> 01:00:34,240
Year at that point I don't know I don't know that just well
just sucks to you i guess uh stop leaking the strategy how

563
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:42,900
many firstborns are out there this is only reserved to
firstborn children only who are not married

564
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:55,500
all right sorry that was a weird i haven't guys i haven't
tangent in so long it's actually been so long since I've

565
01:00:55,500 --> 01:00:55,880
tangent.

566
01:00:56,320 --> 01:00:57,460
It's so weird.

567
01:00:57,520 --> 01:01:00,460
I haven't talked this long in a... I... Oh my gosh.

568
01:01:00,540 --> 01:01:03,560
I haven't talked this long in a while.

569
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:05,200
Oh yes.

570
01:01:05,420 --> 01:01:06,560
What are you guys?

571
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:09,940
You're... I don't really want you guys to be Bark Nights.

572
01:01:10,460 --> 01:01:12,780
Because, um...

573
01:01:12,780 --> 01:01:19,140
To be honest, uh... I feel like the Bark Nights are the
past.

574
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:22,320
Well, past, past.

575
01:01:22,820 --> 01:01:23,120
Current.

576
01:01:24,660 --> 01:01:25,980
This is current now.

577
01:01:26,700 --> 01:01:29,860
I know it's a bit mind-fucking.

578
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:32,600
But this past current life.

579
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:35,280
I guess that's how you explain it.

580
01:01:35,860 --> 01:01:37,260
I feel like we've grown.

581
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:39,100
As a person.

582
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:40,660
I'm a person now.

583
01:01:40,820 --> 01:01:41,860
I actually can say I'm a tomato.

584
01:01:42,120 --> 01:01:42,860
How we grown.

585
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:44,200
The skin suit.

586
01:01:44,320 --> 01:01:45,280
I'm a person now.

587
01:01:46,280 --> 01:01:46,600
Whoa.

588
01:01:47,060 --> 01:01:48,340
She takes off her hat.

589
01:01:48,620 --> 01:01:50,260
She has some animal character.

590
01:01:50,420 --> 01:01:51,360
We'll never know.

591
01:01:51,640 --> 01:01:53,060
We'll never know what's under this hat.

592
01:01:57,420 --> 01:02:07,600
um so i honestly i don't know um anyone like suggest what
you guys want to be called uh and honestly we can just

593
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:15,940
decide and chat right now what you guys want to be called um
because i really i i don't want you guys to be bark knights

594
01:02:15,940 --> 01:02:21,620
and i don't know what you guys are is it great oh yeah What
are you, though, Doki?

595
01:02:22,340 --> 01:02:27,820
Well, I don't know if you guys heard of an evolution, but,
like, I'm a bird now.

596
01:02:28,420 --> 01:02:29,780
Whoa, so clever.

597
01:02:30,500 --> 01:02:35,260
As if, like, 200,000 people didn't make the same joke, and I
just stole it off chat.

598
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:38,220
Uh, because, uh, this thief never steals.

599
01:02:38,740 --> 01:02:41,000
Um, free birds.

600
01:02:42,220 --> 01:02:42,620
Okay.

601
01:02:44,460 --> 01:02:47,740
It just doesn't make sense.

602
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:49,820
Free birds.

603
01:02:51,340 --> 01:03:01,140
I know you guys want to be caught up, but like, if I use
that in a sentence, that's the hardest part, because you're

604
01:03:01,140 --> 01:03:05,200
like, you want it to be usable in the sentence as well.

605
01:03:05,840 --> 01:03:09,920
So, like, Free Birds isn't, like, the best way to say stuff.

606
01:03:15,540 --> 01:03:18,540
So, like, I actually don't even know what you guys are.

607
01:03:21,960 --> 01:03:30,060
different designs too we'll figure that out we'll have a
we'll have a we'll have like a fan mascot stream in the

608
01:03:30,060 --> 01:03:38,220
future whenever I figure out my schedule and everything so
don't worry guys we're gonna have a fan mascot a fan mascot

609
01:03:38,220 --> 01:03:48,700
stream where we draw the fan mascot in the next time um but
for now I do really would like to I do really want to decide

610
01:03:48,700 --> 01:03:52,400
a name for all of you Because I don't know.

611
01:03:52,560 --> 01:03:54,540
I don't fucking know what to call you.

612
01:03:55,900 --> 01:03:57,840
We need some material to work with.

613
01:03:57,920 --> 01:03:59,440
I'm sorry.

614
01:04:00,700 --> 01:04:02,440
I found out two days ago.

615
01:04:05,060 --> 01:04:08,140
I can use that joke because I'm the depressed one here.

616
01:04:08,860 --> 01:04:10,540
Like, you just got...

617
01:04:10,540 --> 01:04:12,480
I've been through so much at this point.

618
01:04:12,580 --> 01:04:15,460
It's all about laughing it off at that point.

619
01:04:15,880 --> 01:04:31,860
Because, like, if I stop and think and realize the reality,
of everything I it will not be great for me so we have to we

620
01:04:31,860 --> 01:04:43,060
still have to laugh it off sometimes um the i'm not calling
you guys the fucking flock the raft don't the fuck you guys

621
01:04:43,060 --> 01:04:47,700
a basketball team No, absolutely not.

622
01:04:49,560 --> 01:04:54,600
Look, I'm not going to have fucking little tomatoes running
around.

623
01:04:55,580 --> 01:04:56,680
Not have that.

624
01:04:57,440 --> 01:04:58,500
Tomatoes are for...

625
01:04:58,500 --> 01:05:00,060
Tiny tomatoes are for eating.

626
01:05:00,320 --> 01:05:02,540
Big tomatoes are for eating little tiny tomatoes.

627
01:05:05,020 --> 01:05:05,960
We're not...

628
01:05:05,960 --> 01:05:08,100
I'm not calling you guys the nuggets.

629
01:05:08,760 --> 01:05:10,620
What are these names?

630
01:05:11,380 --> 01:05:14,380
I came back for you guys to backseat me better.

631
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:20,160
Yes, it's supposed to be better backseaters

632
01:05:27,100 --> 01:05:31,120
I like how someone's That's a hockey team

633
01:05:34,940 --> 01:05:44,760
Alright guys Alright Apparently Apparently Right now Why
must you hate all our ideas?

Why must you hate all our ideas?

635
01:05:47,660 --> 01:05:52,540
Well I don't even know this this but

636
01:05:58,560 --> 01:06:09,220
it's not that I hate all your ideas but your ideas are
pretty fucking terrible look I get it I get it it's been a

637
01:06:09,220 --> 01:06:16,220
while it's been a while you guys gotta get all the terrible
ideas out first before we hit the good ones so like I get it

638
01:06:16,220 --> 01:06:22,060
you haven't let them out yet in the long time you know you
haven't said all these you've been keeping all these

639
01:06:22,060 --> 01:06:24,220
terrible ideas in you for so long.

640
01:06:24,760 --> 01:06:29,740
So, like, eventually, you know, you get all that out of your
system and fall into the routines.

641
01:06:29,980 --> 01:06:31,640
Good ideas will start coming out.

642
01:06:32,260 --> 01:06:32,680
The Okie doke.

643
01:06:32,780 --> 01:06:34,540
Oh my are we, like, what, in kindergarten?

01:06:40,600 --> 01:06:41,720
Little Okie-Dokie.

01:06:41,940 --> 01:06:42,380
No.

648
01:06:43,320 --> 01:06:43,760
No.

649
01:06:46,040 --> 01:06:46,480
No.

650
01:06:49,220 --> 01:06:49,660
The...

651
01:06:53,020 --> 01:07:07,860
wingman hello wingman no no absolutely not absolutely not
we're not no wingman okay all right i feel like i feel like

652
01:07:07,860 --> 01:07:19,560
all of us are having trouble here so it's moving on moving
on use the dokey tag suggestions use the dokey tag

653
01:07:19,560 --> 01:07:27,540
suggestion to figure out, you know, you know, what you want
to be called.

654
01:07:27,960 --> 01:07:29,040
What you want to be called.

655
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:31,260
Because at the moment...

656
01:07:33,160 --> 01:07:34,480
I like how it's like...

657
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:36,540
I like how there's literally two...

658
01:07:36,540 --> 01:07:40,360
I think I didn't make a PowerPoint slide because these are
the two things I really...

659
01:07:40,360 --> 01:07:42,040
Like, likes and dislikes!

660
01:07:42,500 --> 01:07:43,120
I don't...

661
01:07:43,120 --> 01:07:43,800
I don't...

662
01:07:43,800 --> 01:07:47,320
At this point, I feel like we all...

663
01:07:47,320 --> 01:07:50,260
To be fair, who the fuck watches...

664
01:07:51,260 --> 01:07:53,260
Back to watch just for the likes and dislikes.

665
01:07:53,600 --> 01:07:55,300
Like, I'm gonna say it.

666
01:07:55,520 --> 01:07:56,840
I'm gonna say it.

667
01:07:57,820 --> 01:07:58,340
Like...

668
01:07:58,340 --> 01:08:00,820
Who the fuck actually...

669
01:08:00,820 --> 01:08:02,240
What the fuck?

670
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:03,880
Oh, shit.

671
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:04,860
Oh, wait, that's fine.

672
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:06,060
I'm not even monetized.

673
01:08:11,020 --> 01:08:12,060
Oh, shit.

674
01:08:12,440 --> 01:08:14,840
That scared the shit out of me.

675
01:08:18,260 --> 01:08:19,580
Oh, my God.

676
01:08:21,340 --> 01:08:23,420
Um, where the fuck is the ad?

677
01:08:25,280 --> 01:08:26,660
There we go.

678
01:08:30,620 --> 01:08:39,000
I, I honestly, I'm just, even though I'm not monetized, I
only don't want this thing getting, like, this song is

679
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:40,900
blocked in these countries.

680
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:42,280
Because that would fucking suck.

681
01:08:42,360 --> 01:08:44,140
That would actually, like, suck.

682
01:08:45,560 --> 01:08:46,500
Where was I?

683
01:08:47,360 --> 01:08:50,660
Wait, what was I talking about before I got...

684
01:08:51,260 --> 01:08:51,660
before.

685
01:08:52,380 --> 01:08:53,680
Fuck, what was I talking about?

686
01:08:54,920 --> 01:08:55,600
God damn it.

687
01:08:55,860 --> 01:08:57,680
Now I have free birds stuck in my head.

688
01:08:59,580 --> 01:09:01,980
We're not gonna be called free birds!

689
01:09:02,460 --> 01:09:03,200
It doesn't...

690
01:09:03,200 --> 01:09:06,180
I know you guys... Holy shit Lord Pancake!

691
01:09:06,440 --> 01:09:09,340
I'm so sorry like if you all...

692
01:09:09,340 --> 01:09:11,540
Thank you so much for the donation.

693
01:09:11,840 --> 01:09:12,340
Thank you.

694
01:09:12,600 --> 01:09:12,960
Okay.

695
01:09:13,180 --> 01:09:14,020
I'm gonna say it.

696
01:09:14,280 --> 01:09:17,320
Like I don't look back to a YouTuber debut.

697
01:09:17,820 --> 01:09:18,820
Honestly, it's not even a debut.

698
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:19,520
I'm just back.

699
01:09:19,660 --> 01:09:24,880
Like to be like, Wait, I have my debut stream still.

700
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:26,340
That's right.

701
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:29,880
I'm not making it because why did I put my birthday?

702
01:09:30,120 --> 01:09:35,660
You can literally look at the debut stream that's still on
this channel from four years ago.

703
01:09:36,180 --> 01:09:37,180
It's still there.

704
01:09:41,220 --> 01:09:44,960
I can't believe I forgot I've debuted before.

705
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:57,480
and I'm holy shit guys I've actually debuted before so you
can look at the debut pod for likes and dislikes why did I

706
01:09:57,480 --> 01:10:08,080
even put birthday alright anyway oh but the tags back there
they're like retired um because it's new me new me new life

707
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:12,680
I like how people are still like what about free bird we're
not gonna be free bird the reason why we're not gonna be

708
01:10:12,680 --> 01:10:19,940
free birds is that it doesn't It doesn't, like, roll off the
tongue as good as you guys think it does.

709
01:10:20,360 --> 01:10:21,180
It doesn't.

710
01:10:22,220 --> 01:10:26,060
Also, also, um...

711
01:10:26,860 --> 01:10:28,100
Like, how do you...

712
01:10:28,100 --> 01:10:30,260
How the fuck do you visualize that?

713
01:10:30,740 --> 01:10:31,300
Like...

714
01:10:31,300 --> 01:10:32,360
Like...

715
01:10:32,360 --> 01:10:38,260
It's harder for all of us to, like, think of, like, what y
'all look like if you're called Free Bird.

716
01:10:43,820 --> 01:10:44,940
So don't...

717
01:10:44,960 --> 01:10:45,940
where we'll figure that out.

718
01:10:46,160 --> 01:10:48,360
We'll figure that out soon.

719
01:10:49,740 --> 01:10:52,180
Um, but, oh my god.

720
01:10:58,450 --> 01:11:05,470
Oh, it's actually, it's, uh, it's actually, it's just been
wild.

721
01:11:05,650 --> 01:11:15,890
I, I feel like I haven't, I feel like I'm losing stamina
because like, I haven't talked this long in a very long

722
01:11:15,890 --> 01:11:16,410
time.

723
01:11:19,030 --> 01:11:35,030
I'm so I'm just I'm not used to it but I also I I miss it so
much I really do I I really I really miss this a lot and I

724
01:11:35,030 --> 01:11:50,930
really just I miss just talking with all of you and and just
I guess like restarting and and oh god there's just so much

725
01:11:50,930 --> 01:12:02,150
potential and let's try let's try and aim for 500k
subscribers by the end of this year okay guys you guys think

726
01:12:02,150 --> 01:12:12,170
we can do it I think that's I think like goals wise I would
love to hit 500 alright goals oh my god goals almost forgot

727
01:12:12,170 --> 01:12:25,410
I think it'll be 500k subscribers by the end of this year
and then my dream goal would be a million subscribers and um

728
01:12:25,410 --> 01:12:38,710
i i guess like the pc uh a pc sponsor and a gaming gear
sponsor oh my gosh i would love to have a gaming gear

729
01:12:38,710 --> 01:12:47,030
sponsor i want i want i want to you know like there's like
you know like because okay I love when people are like why

730
01:12:47,030 --> 01:12:55,190

understand alright for all you non-gamers out there you have

731
01:12:55,190 --> 01:13:06,090
a normal desk mat that's like cute or I don't know like
anime like JJK on there or some shit I don't know usually

732
01:13:06,090 --> 01:13:13,630
it's either something fucking cute or like the anime of the
year which would be I guess like JK.

733
01:13:14,450 --> 01:13:20,330
And then on top of it, you have a second mouse pad on top of
it.

734
01:13:20,690 --> 01:13:21,950
And it's the gamer mouse pad.

735
01:13:22,130 --> 01:13:25,210
So it's like, I use the, what the fuck do I use?

736
01:13:26,530 --> 01:13:28,030
I think I use the hand effects.

737
01:13:28,250 --> 01:13:28,730
I can't read.

738
01:13:28,830 --> 01:13:29,590
It's been used a while.

739
01:13:30,030 --> 01:13:33,510
So I use the hand effects, but there's like Skypad and stuff
like that.

740
01:13:33,830 --> 01:13:37,090
Like if you want to use glass, like mouse pad, there's like
Skypad.

741
01:13:37,690 --> 01:13:40,390
And I would love to have any gaming gear.

742
01:13:40,850 --> 01:13:43,370
I should write this down, but like, you guys can write it
down.

It's nice to laugh again.

01:15:59,280 --> 01:16:00,120
I don't think I've laughed.

757
01:16:00,360 --> 01:16:03,080
I haven't laughed this much in a while now.

758
01:16:03,660 --> 01:16:09,080

01:19:08,640 --> 01:19:09,100

799
01:19:09,780 --> 01:19:13,660
Fuck, okay Shit, okay, wait, wait, I had something.

800
01:19:14,420 --> 01:19:15,760
I had something right there.

801
01:19:16,140 --> 01:19:17,100
God damn it, never mind, I forgot.

802
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:20,920
I forgot, I actually forgot what I was gonna say.

803
01:19:21,940 --> 01:19:26,880
Okay, but yes, one of my first streams I really want to do
was... Did you guys know there's private Neopets server?

804
01:19:27,760 --> 01:19:35,340
Oh my god, I was talking to Gumi, you know, Gumi, one of my
best friends for like seven fucking plus years.

805
01:19:35,680 --> 01:19:40,820
I was talking to Gumi, and like, she's like, bitch, why the
fuck are you talking about Neopets?

806
01:19:41,060 --> 01:19:48,100
And I was just like that's gonna be my that's gonna be my
first gaming stream and she was like oh my god check out my

807
01:19:48,100 --> 01:19:59,480
private server neopets account and that blew my fucking mind
there's private server neopets account like and she was like

808
01:19:59,480 --> 01:20:10,520
yeah inflation fucking sucks on the rig on the public
servers I was like what it's like it got so bad that people

809
01:20:10,520 --> 01:20:18,080
had to make private servers because the inflation fucking
sucks like that blew my fucking mind I was like excuse me I

810
01:20:18,080 --> 01:20:27,180
can finally do it I can finally stream meal pets oh my god
they brought back unconverted pets do you guys know that fun

811
01:20:27,180 --> 01:20:35,220
fact um the unconverted pets are on the black market where
you actually have to pay pay real money like thousands of

812
01:20:35,220 --> 01:20:42,420
dollars to own an unconverted pet and now the market fucking
crashed because now they're introducing it back because um

813
01:20:42,420 --> 01:20:48,660
the creators of all right okay i can say this now because
like i'm i don't have to like tiptoe to lie but if you guys

814
01:20:48,660 --> 01:21:04,480
didn't know neopets used to be owned by scientology i can
say that now like i don't okay but but they sold They sold

815
01:21:04,480 --> 01:21:04,900
it.

816
01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:07,500
And then they try to be an NFT game.

817
01:21:08,240 --> 01:21:10,460
And then they sold it to someone else.

818
01:21:11,840 --> 01:21:12,640
And...

819
01:21:12,640 --> 01:21:14,000
And now...

820
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,660
Now it's bought back by...

821
01:21:16,660 --> 01:21:21,500
Apparently the CEO of Neopets now is actually like...

822
01:21:23,100 --> 01:21:26,300
Some nostalgic old Neopets player.

823
01:21:27,280 --> 01:21:32,060
He's like some fucking guy that grew up on Neopets who's
like some tech Mongol now.

824
01:21:32,060 --> 01:21:40,320
and he like bought back Neo pets and he's like bring back
unconverted pets which I think it's because you know he's

825
01:21:40,320 --> 01:21:48,740
like I have so much money now I will I don't want to you
know what you have like a lot of money and then you're just

826
01:21:48,740 --> 01:21:56,500
like give me back what the original version was so I can
live my childhood now that type of deal we have so much

827
01:21:56,500 --> 01:22:02,780
money you buy back something and just revert it back to what
it was because that's where you had found happiness So,

828
01:22:02,920 --> 01:22:04,180
like, that's what he did.

829
01:22:04,860 --> 01:22:08,580
And now, the Allen Converted Pets are back now.

830
01:22:09,380 --> 01:22:15,620
So, like, he literally brought back, like, nostalgia just
for himself.

831
01:22:19,360 --> 01:22:25,260
All right, so, like, what I want to do on Neo Pets is I want
to enter the beauty contest because I want to fucking

832
01:22:25,260 --> 01:22:35,060
actually win first place in a beauty contest with the least
amount of effort and Neopets taught me the hard thing like

833
01:22:35,060 --> 01:22:41,820
taught me fucking harsh reality where it's not about how
good you are at art it's basically a fucking popularity

834
01:22:41,820 --> 01:22:50,200
contest and who to fuck advertise like and who advertises on
the beauty contest forums the most and all that I'll vote

835
01:22:50,200 --> 01:22:58,520
for you shit if you vote for me now now I'm a streamer so I
can abuse

836
01:23:05,540 --> 01:23:21,500

work for that anymore so Roblox someone said it I can

837
01:23:21,500 --> 01:23:36,340
finally do warrior cats roleplay no you don't understand
warrior cats roleplay has been thing I wanted to stream for

838
01:23:36,340 --> 01:23:37,480
fucking ever.

839
01:23:38,200 --> 01:23:38,200
No!

840
01:23:38,620 --> 01:23:38,960
Okay.

841
01:23:39,520 --> 01:23:39,800
Okay.

842
01:23:40,020 --> 01:23:46,280
I know like, okay, for those who never grew up with warrior
cats, all right, now you read, okay, when you get older, you

843
01:23:46,280 --> 01:23:49,000
realize this, the books were pretty fucked up.

844
01:23:49,320 --> 01:23:51,580
Um, because like, it was written by three different women.

845
01:23:51,760 --> 01:23:52,460
Like I said, girls.

846
01:23:52,880 --> 01:23:55,000
Uh, it was written by three different women.

847
01:23:55,600 --> 01:24:00,180
And like, there were so many fucking cats that like, they
didn't even know what the fuck was going on anymore.

848
01:24:00,720 --> 01:24:01,020
Because

849
01:24:04,100 --> 01:24:11,320
One book was made by three different women That it was so
hard to remember what cat was what Because I felt like

850
01:24:11,320 --> 01:24:18,960
they're always making babies So like there's always new
fucking cats So there's like a whole fucking Wikipedia

851
01:24:18,960 --> 01:24:26,920
Trying to figure out which cat is what Because there's so
many There's like Ravenpaw 1 and Ravenpaw 2 Ravenpaw 1 from

852
01:24:26,920 --> 01:24:36,060
Fire Clan And then Ravenpaw fucking 500 and Shadow Clan and

Why the fuck do I want to be Canadian dollar?

01:30:09,180 --> 01:30:10,860
Why would Canadians relate, though?

915
01:30:11,300 --> 01:30:11,860
Canadians relate.

916
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:13,480
We'd rather have American money.

917
01:30:14,040 --> 01:30:21,940
Well, I'd rather have American money and then, like, you
know, fucking, even if we convert it back to Canadian money,

918
01:30:22,620 --> 01:30:25,380
it's still a lot more money than Canadian.

919
01:30:26,580 --> 01:30:38,000
not wrong give me that sweet old american cash not canadian
cash uh oh yeah we put 90 for free fucking new video games

01:34:39,540 --> 01:34:46,420
But then, like, the thing is, like, one of his adopted
sibling was, like, was like, I don't like Bella.

950
01:34:47,640 --> 01:34:48,920
Like, I don't like Bella.

951
01:34:49,340 --> 01:34:51,040
I don't want her, like, near us.

952
01:34:51,120 --> 01:34:52,020
She's a human.

953
01:34:52,960 --> 01:34:54,920
But, like, I was like, bro.

954
01:34:55,000 --> 01:35:15,800
bro he's let him have something you have your fucking
adopted brother he has nothing for a hundred years I was

955
01:35:15,800 --> 01:35:30,340
like bro she's like no I want him to be single forever I was
like that's so fucked up anyway also there's wolf puberty

956
01:35:30,340 --> 01:35:38,660
too for those who don't know wolf okay so for the context
for wolf puberty it's that um the context of wolf puberty is

957
01:35:38,660 --> 01:35:47,120
that so there's a wolf tribe and like when you hit wolf
puberty you like beef the fuck up so like before before you

958
01:35:47,120 --> 01:35:55,780
hit wolf puberty you're like this fucking scrawny kid i read
the first book of twilight for those at that time in my

959
01:35:55,780 --> 01:35:56,580
volleyball team.

960
01:35:57,220 --> 01:36:00,360
And then everyone in my volleyball team read Twilight.

961
01:36:00,640 --> 01:36:03,800
And then they were always like, are you Team Edward or Team
Jacob?

962
01:36:04,220 --> 01:36:09,840
So I wanted to fit in because they would be on a fucking
like doggy pile reading Twilight and shit like that.

963
01:36:10,160 --> 01:36:14,500
So then I was like, oh shit, okay, I need to fit in with
these girls.

964
01:36:14,920 --> 01:36:16,700
So I guess I'll read Twilight.

965
01:36:17,100 --> 01:36:18,980
After I read like up to two books.

966
01:36:19,120 --> 01:36:22,400
And then after that, I still buy the book so I can bring it
to practice.

967
01:36:22,400 --> 01:36:29,460
But like when the book comes when the newest book comes out
I would go to like the Twilight Wikipedia and just read the

968
01:36:29,460 --> 01:36:35,420
wiki But I'll pretend to bring I'll bring the book to
pretend that I read it So then they'll like ask me about the

969
01:36:35,420 --> 01:36:40,980
plot and then I just be like I'll just fucking I'll just
remember the shit I read on Wikipedia so I didn't have to

970
01:36:40,980 --> 01:36:41,840
read the book

971
01:36:48,050 --> 01:36:50,650
Because I'm sorry but it was so bad

972
01:36:53,770 --> 01:37:01,910
I just cliff note that shit because like anyway in the book
Jacob is like some fucking scrawny ass teenager or some shit

973
01:37:01,910 --> 01:37:09,110
but then he hits wolf puberty puberty and he starts taking
off shirt and like gets like buffer the thing is the actor

974
01:37:09,110 --> 01:37:17,110
that plays Jacob Taylor Taylor and Loner by the way he
marries his wife is also called Taylor Loner and consider

975
01:37:17,110 --> 01:37:23,610
Taylor and Taylor um I don't fucking know I'm not I don't
know what the fuck is going on with that scenario I don't

976
01:37:23,610 --> 01:37:25,010
know That's like a fucking fetish or something.

977
01:37:25,530 --> 01:37:26,710
But like, it has to be.

978
01:37:26,890 --> 01:37:28,490
Like, I feel like it just has to be.

979
01:37:28,590 --> 01:37:29,630
Like, why the fuck would you...

980
01:37:29,630 --> 01:37:30,350
Oh my god.

981
01:37:30,710 --> 01:37:31,230
Who are you?

982
01:37:31,310 --> 01:37:32,090
Taylor Laundry?

983
01:37:32,710 --> 01:37:33,170
You're...

984
01:37:33,170 --> 01:37:33,970
Oh my god.

985
01:37:34,490 --> 01:37:35,310
What a coincidence.

986
01:37:35,690 --> 01:37:36,650
Now I love you.

987
01:37:38,030 --> 01:37:38,490
Anyway.

988
01:37:39,750 --> 01:37:40,210
Um.

989
01:37:40,670 --> 01:37:41,070
Anyway.

990
01:37:41,490 --> 01:37:43,770
But like in the movies, Jacob.

991
01:37:44,330 --> 01:37:46,010
Jacob is like...

992
01:37:46,010 --> 01:37:46,770
He looks...

993
01:37:48,030 --> 01:37:49,750
He didn't get skinnier.

994
01:37:50,030 --> 01:37:51,010
For the role.

995
01:37:51,530 --> 01:37:53,070
They just put more clothes on him.

996
01:37:53,090 --> 01:37:53,750
So he...

997
01:37:58,610 --> 01:38:07,590
like you can tell you can tell like he didn't want to force
him to like bulk up for the second movie so like you can

998
01:38:07,590 --> 01:38:15,570
tell that they're like how the fuck do we make him look like
like a scrawny ass stick let's just put like 500 layers of

999
01:38:15,570 --> 01:38:21,910
clothes on him and give him long hair to hide his like
fucking muscle or some shit and then like when he hits wolf

1000
01:38:21,910 --> 01:38:30,730
puberty let's just give make him shirtless and cut his hair
so it looks like he hit wolf puberty so that's a little fun

1001
01:38:30,730 --> 01:38:41,790
fact wanted also uh yes i'll confirm that she was like here

of the budget for the main character Pinocchio and then put

1030
01:42:16,710 --> 01:42:25,570

And with prizes and everything and trophies and physical
trophies.

1036

I think it'll be really fun.

1037
01:43:07,470 --> 01:43:12,050
I think like the most fun events are the ones that you can
be super creative about.

Have like something to cheer on for Yeah, that's like some

Leave that call

1040
01:43:36,850 --> 01:43:43,590
I wonder if you can fix up I wonder if Mr. Man would take
that seriously or not.

1041
01:43:43,910 --> 01:43:45,730
He's not even watching the first stream anyway.

1042
01:43:45,870 --> 01:43:48,170
He doesn't fucking know if I'm serious or not.

1043
01:43:50,070 --> 01:43:51,130
Open store.

1044
01:43:54,410 --> 01:43:55,510
Okay, I'll just write JK.

1045
01:44:03,610 --> 01:44:05,890
I want to do escape rooms.

1046
01:44:06,050 --> 01:44:12,230
I want to do like Minecraft escape rooms and like pit people
against each other.

1047
01:44:13,190 --> 01:44:15,150
That shit would be so fun.

1048
01:44:15,510 --> 01:44:17,270
And then you'd be like, oh my god, which.

1049
01:44:18,470 --> 01:44:23,030
Which, like, and then you guys can, like, cheer on for,
like, which team of our team and stuff like that.

1050
01:44:23,090 --> 01:44:24,170
That would be so fucking fun.

1051
01:44:24,250 --> 01:44:32,650
I feel like there's not a lot of, like, um, like, there's a
lot of, like, MCC for, like, Minecraft content creators.

1052
01:44:33,150 --> 01:44:37,850
But you don't see, like, a lot of MCC for, like, VTubers as
well.

1053
01:44:38,230 --> 01:44:40,570
So I want to do, like, a VTuber MCC.

1054
01:44:43,170 --> 01:44:51,850
and stuff with like mini games and everything because like
oh my god I can do so many things I can do so many plans and

1055
01:44:51,850 --> 01:44:55,190
projects and league games

1056
01:45:02,110 --> 01:45:14,290
obviously Apex of course of course I actually do have like
an Apex tournament that I'm working on with some best some

1057
01:45:14,290 --> 01:45:31,230
besties so that's something to look forward to as well um
that's right we're still the besties we're still there we're

1058
01:45:31,230 --> 01:45:44,350
still there um and honestly like i said there's so many
ideas and um i'm really excited to plan all of that with,

1059
01:45:44,890 --> 01:45:46,190
uh, with my manager.

1060
01:45:47,430 --> 01:45:48,330
And I cannot wait.

1061
01:45:48,410 --> 01:45:49,110
I really cannot wait.

1062
01:45:49,350 --> 01:45:49,790
I cannot wait.

1063
01:45:49,790 --> 01:45:51,070
I cannot wait.

1064
01:45:51,110 --> 01:45:52,530
I cannot wait to get started.

1065
01:45:53,170 --> 01:45:55,150
I, I'm so excited, honestly.

1066
01:45:56,110 --> 01:46:01,090
Uh, oh yeah, for those who don't know what MCC is, it's like
the Minecraft championship, but usually it's like something

1067
01:46:01,090 --> 01:46:04,030
you see for Minecrafters, like Minecraft content creators.

1068
01:46:04,410 --> 01:46:05,570
But honestly, I haven't seen one of those.

1069
01:46:05,830 --> 01:46:14,590
I really want to do like, I feel like a lot of tournaments
and a lot of events, they're like always one company and

1070
01:46:14,590 --> 01:46:14,830
stuff.

1071
01:46:14,910 --> 01:46:20,290
I think it'd be really fun to have like in a company wide.

1072
01:46:20,610 --> 01:46:30,950
Oh, like team Indies and like and like like different
companies and NA participating and stuff and like fan bases

1073
01:46:30,950 --> 01:46:34,010
from different areas like watching.

1074
01:46:34,050 --> 01:46:34,970
I think that would be really fun.

1075
01:46:35,150 --> 01:46:40,870
I really think, because you always see like tournaments
events usually from one company.

1076
01:46:41,430 --> 01:46:48,570
But I think it'd be really cool to have like uh to set
something up where people from different companies can

1077
01:46:48,570 --> 01:46:56,630
participate and stuff so yeah i want to do something like
that all right okay okay i see it powworld i'm gonna say it

1078
01:46:58,590 --> 01:47:07,810
after you play like three days of powworld's non-stop like
you it's that's it like

1079
01:47:11,630 --> 01:47:18,310
i'm gonna Fucking say it You realize it's it's a fun.

1080
01:47:18,610 --> 01:47:28,190
It's fun, but like when you hit three day needs the power
You hit a point where you're like all right.

1081
01:47:28,630 --> 01:47:35,010
Yeah, I realize after three days it's like the same thing
It's like

1082
01:47:38,210 --> 01:47:47,230
And like honestly like it just needs like more It needs more
updates to keep me interested.

1083
01:47:47,690 --> 01:47:54,150
But, like, the thing about Palworld, the thing about
Palworld is that, like, it is very fun.

1084
01:47:54,230 --> 01:47:59,590
It's a very fun unique concept, and, honestly, like, that's
what we need.

1085
01:47:59,690 --> 01:48:02,630
Like, I wish we had that in other similar...

1086
01:48:04,770 --> 01:48:05,530
Wait, I can say it now.

1087
01:48:05,970 --> 01:48:06,650
In Pokemon!

1088
01:48:11,030 --> 01:48:12,610
Sorry, my inner filter.

1089
01:48:12,630 --> 01:48:14,330
fucking kicked in

1090
01:48:19,210 --> 01:48:26,510
because I liked like the ones that Pokemon Legends Arceus or
whatever that was that was that was that one I really liked

1091
01:48:26,510 --> 01:48:39,850
that one I really really liked that game and I wish I wish I
wish Pokemon can be similar as well the fucking Mr. Man I

1092
01:48:39,850 --> 01:48:43,830
cannot stall Mr. Man Wait, why did I type Mr. Man?

1093
01:48:44,190 --> 01:48:49,430
I know, like, I cannot stall anymore.

1094
01:48:56,210 --> 01:48:56,830

1096
01:49:06,550 --> 01:49:07,170
Um.

1097
01:49:08,010 --> 01:49:18,510
But yeah, I think, like, streaming is a great it's just when
you start streaming i don't know streaming always makes me a

1098
01:49:18,510 --> 01:49:31,110
lot happier and when i couldn't stream i felt so empty oh my

1173
01:58:06,450 --> 01:58:07,170
In between.

1174
01:58:07,490 --> 01:58:12,590
It's like going through like 30 minutes of ads before you
get to the what you want type deal.

1175
01:58:13,610 --> 01:58:20,410
It's like, if you want to learn more, go through the 30
minute ads of fucking Roblox, Warrior Cats RP.

1176
01:58:21,250 --> 01:58:22,210
No skipping.

01:58:26,950 --> 01:58:27,550
Yeah.

1180
01:58:31,230 --> 01:58:34,590
Anyway, after I said all of that, I actually forgot what I
was trying.

1181
01:58:34,650 --> 01:58:35,650
Oh, yes, main platform.

1182
01:58:36,210 --> 01:58:37,870
Main platform will be YouTube.

1183
01:58:38,450 --> 01:58:44,670
And I will also be planning on...

1184
01:58:44,670 --> 01:58:50,590
I will be planning on streaming on Twitch as well as Billy
Billy.

1185
01:58:51,290 --> 01:58:54,050
So, but it's not going to be like...

1186
01:58:54,050 --> 01:58:55,830
It's just like, you know, in the past.

1187
01:58:55,910 --> 01:58:57,830
It's not like a common thing being on...

1188
01:58:58,190 --> 01:59:06,650
uh on those two say you know the best part okay i'm gonna
see i want i'm almost gonna be very curious if like because

1189
01:59:06,650 --> 01:59:14,410
like my old twitch account um i've already hit like partner
requirements and no it's not gonna be a simulcast i i don't

1190
01:59:14,410 --> 01:59:26,610
like that i don't i personally i personally don't like oh my
god you know uh i don't even guys remember you know um but

1191
01:59:26,610 --> 01:59:37,570
she actually reached out and said she'd help me with uh with
making with making an account so um so i really appreciate

1192
01:59:37,570 --> 01:59:47,830
it too um but yes anyway what i'm gonna say my twitch i've
actually hit twitch partner long long long ago and i never

1193
01:59:47,830 --> 01:59:57,970
got it because all i did was send in the b movie script oh
dokey maybe you stop sending the fucking B-movie script to

1194
01:59:57,970 --> 01:59:58,690
the Twitch staff.

1195
01:59:58,830 --> 02:00:00,390
Maybe you do what I've got, Twitch partner.

1196
02:00:01,290 --> 02:00:07,330
So, um, I was, um, I think I applied like three to four
times or something.

1197
02:00:07,450 --> 02:00:12,670
I got rejected every time because all I did was just send in
the B-movie script to them.

1198
02:00:15,830 --> 02:00:17,110
Repeatedly, yes.

1199
02:00:20,310 --> 02:00:20,830
Repeatedly.

1200
02:00:21,270 --> 02:00:32,390
And so, because of that, um, they rejected me, like, three
to four times and um but i still am eligible to reapply so i

1201
02:00:32,390 --> 02:00:45,070
was thinking wow if i do one stream on it maybe we'll take
it would it would they give me partner and so i can have i

1202
02:00:45,070 --> 02:00:54,210
need to figure out emotes too also i need to figure out how
the emotes and like i need to get emotes only i I get so

1203
02:00:56,650 --> 02:01:01,410
Your mom told you not to spend So much money anymore

1204
02:01:04,470 --> 02:01:12,250
I still can't believe I spent 200,000 and 100 How am I so
stupid?

1205
02:01:15,470 --> 02:01:20,110
Remember where I was like I stopped looking at my bank
account when I'm spending money?

1206
02:01:25,110 --> 02:01:27,590
What the fuck was wrong with me?

1207
02:01:30,510 --> 02:01:31,630
I'm just...

1208
02:01:32,170 --> 02:01:34,310
I just really...

1209
02:01:34,310 --> 02:01:37,530
I just want to have fun with all of you guys.

1210
02:01:37,770 --> 02:01:38,950

It's like a trigger.

02:04:50,860 --> 02:04:59,960
you know it's like that you know um i won't say it though
that's that's okay that's why that's what the poll is for

1251
02:04:59,960 --> 02:05:14,420
that's what it's for all right guys it's gonna be scouts but
like the store when it goes live it does not have a I just

1252
02:05:14,420 --> 02:05:19,120

02:05:22,380 --> 02:05:26,820
We'll fix this I had two days

1254
02:05:30,580 --> 02:05:41,360

02:05:42,580 --> 02:05:53,120
We will fix it post do not worry do not uh the store is
gonna go live and chat's gonna instantly yeah i'm never okay

1256
02:05:53,120 --> 02:06:06,940
honestly like i i like pre-ordered like 50 because i don't i
didn't okay when my when my therapist was like how many

1257
02:06:06,940 --> 02:06:13,900
people are you expecting to watch and i was just like oh i
don't know i Maybe like, I don't know, if it's going to be

1258
02:06:13,900 --> 02:06:16,120
really high, it might be like 50k.

1259
02:06:16,680 --> 02:06:22,760
Like, maybe I think, because of, you know, all that stuff
that happened.

1260
02:06:24,480 --> 02:06:25,680
And then he's like, whoa!

1261
02:06:26,380 --> 02:06:32,500
So then I was like, how many people will buy merch if 50,000
people are going to watch me?

1262
02:06:32,920 --> 02:06:34,400
I'll pre-order 50.

1263
02:06:39,440 --> 02:06:52,580
In my mind, I was like, okay if 50 000 people are gonna
watch me that means 50 people would want merch so like so i

1264
02:06:52,580 --> 02:07:06,460
already in advance because there's was like a lunar new year
discount um there was a lunar uh lunar new year discount um

1265
02:07:06,460 --> 02:07:15,600
at this manufacturer because like i i'm handling all the
that stuff and like coordinating all that stuff so so i was

1266
02:07:15,600 --> 02:07:23,980
like they're like oh how much you want away and i was like
50 that seems like a lot of people that buy my merch and i

1267
02:07:23,980 --> 02:07:34,510
was just like yeah and now i'm like now i'm a little worried
because now i'm like oh no what if what if 50 is just a

1268
02:07:34,510 --> 02:07:38,770
little bit too too little just a little bit under

1269
02:07:46,830 --> 02:07:56,330
just oh man maybe 50 is just you know just a little bit
under so don't worry i that's why it's a pre-order so i can

1270
02:07:56,330 --> 02:08:06,070
order more i will or it's a pre-order so i won't now i know
not to order in advance because I'm just gonna go buy

1271
02:08:06,070 --> 02:08:08,290
pre-orders for this.

1272
02:08:08,650 --> 02:08:14,370
So like, do not worry about that because it will be going by
pre-orders.

1273
02:08:15,090 --> 02:08:18,510
So it's not like I only have 50 in stock.

1274
02:08:19,810 --> 02:08:21,370
Maybe, you know, I don't know.

1275
02:08:21,470 --> 02:08:22,450
Maybe I'll get 60.

1276
02:08:22,950 --> 02:08:23,250
Whoa.

1277
02:08:23,590 --> 02:08:25,070
That'll be fucking insane.

1278
02:08:25,730 --> 02:08:26,290
Holy shit.

1279
02:08:26,370 --> 02:08:28,850
Maybe 60 people will buy my merch.

1280
02:08:34,710 --> 02:08:46,290
but don't worry it's uncapped except for the limited edition
bundle where if the signed postcards that is capped to a

1281
02:08:46,290 --> 02:09:03,150
hundred because a hundred is the limit i will sign a
postcard um because that is a lot of postcards That is just,

1282
02:09:03,350 --> 02:09:04,890
you know, a little, that's a lot.

1283
02:09:05,250 --> 02:09:06,310
That's still a lot.

1284
02:09:06,450 --> 02:09:10,030
And I really, I don't really want to get, how is it called,
when you fuck up your wrists?

1285
02:09:10,650 --> 02:09:11,150
Carpool Tunnel?

1286
02:09:11,370 --> 02:09:15,410
Yeah, I really don't want to get a Carpool Tunnel because,
you know, I play FPS shooters.

1287
02:09:15,750 --> 02:09:19,830
And, like, Carpool Tunnel is where FPS players die.

1288
02:09:20,450 --> 02:09:24,130
So, if I, oh, I shouldn't say that.

1289
02:09:25,670 --> 02:09:25,890
No!

1290
02:09:26,490 --> 02:09:27,650
Wait, no, I shouldn't.

1291
02:09:27,830 --> 02:09:28,830
That's why I shouldn't.

1292
02:09:33,710 --> 02:09:35,870
I go to therapy now.

1293
02:09:36,130 --> 02:09:36,470
I'm okay.

1294
02:09:36,810 --> 02:09:37,910
I couldn't.

1295
02:09:38,630 --> 02:09:40,550
You know, sometimes you gotta be able to laugh.

1296
02:09:41,050 --> 02:09:42,450
Sometimes you gotta be able to laugh.

1297
02:09:43,210 --> 02:09:43,830
Oh my god.

1298
02:09:45,030 --> 02:09:45,370
Okay.

1299
02:09:45,730 --> 02:09:46,150
Anyway.

1300
02:09:49,450 --> 02:09:52,490

02:10:07,590 --> 02:10:16,110
song but it's you can make it your fucking national anthem
if you want but we're not gonna be called free birds because

1305
02:10:16,110 --> 02:10:30,150
look i've been in this game for a while now okay like we've
came up with a solid name last time we can do it again I

1306
02:10:30,150 --> 02:10:39,430
know what makes a good name But like free birds is not a
good free like it's not a good fan mascot name We can do

1307

All right.

1310
02:11:05,970 --> 02:11:07,230
We're not going to be free birds.

1311
02:11:07,910 --> 02:11:09,110
I swear to fucking God.

1312
02:11:09,270 --> 02:11:09,630
We're not.

02:11:10,010 --> 02:11:11,110
Wait, no, that's not.

1314
02:11:11,210 --> 02:11:12,330
No, I was going to say Chirpians.

1315
02:11:12,810 --> 02:11:16,050
It's pretty clever, but like, it's not.

1316
02:11:16,150 --> 02:11:16,690
It's pretty dumb.

1317
02:11:16,890 --> 02:11:24,230
If you say it out loud, if you say it out loud, it's not the
best name.

1318
02:11:24,690 --> 02:11:26,350
It's cool to read it.

1319
02:11:26,830 --> 02:11:27,790
It's cool to read it.

1320
02:11:29,450 --> 02:11:31,250
Uh, the bird brigade.

1321
02:11:31,850 --> 02:11:32,630
Oh, look at that.

1322
02:11:32,750 --> 02:11:34,010
Do you want Doki to yell at you?

1323
02:11:34,270 --> 02:11:35,910
Yes, 83% yes.

1324
02:11:36,170 --> 02:11:39,730
And then people who are saying no are those who are fucking
in denial.

1325
02:11:40,830 --> 02:11:41,490
Alright, that's cool.

1326
02:11:41,610 --> 02:11:42,350

Alright, give me a sec.

1350
02:13:48,470 --> 02:13:50,110
Why is it called Doki Works?

1351
02:13:51,570 --> 02:13:53,030
Oh, because we don't have a...

1352
02:13:53,030 --> 02:13:54,950
We don't have our own domain.

1353
02:13:56,530 --> 02:13:57,770
Doki Mons is cute.

1354
02:14:00,670 --> 02:14:03,430
Go, go, dookimons.

02:14:08,530 --> 02:14:09,010
Dookimons.

1356
02:14:09,870 --> 02:14:11,590
No, because I don't want you guys to be called dookies.

1357
02:14:11,750 --> 02:14:13,090
Like, there can only be one dookie.

1358
02:14:13,410 --> 02:14:16,890
I thought about it, but like, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1359
02:14:17,530 --> 02:14:19,190
I literally renamed my dog.

1360
02:14:25,400 --> 02:14:27,640
I literally gave him a nickname.

1361
02:14:28,300 --> 02:14:30,800
You're not taking dookie from me.

1362
02:14:30,960 --> 02:14:38,360
All right, I really, really, I renamed him to Doki Amber
Doge.

1363
02:14:38,640 --> 02:14:42,860
So, like, you're not taking, you're not taking Doki from me.

1364
02:14:44,060 --> 02:14:47,140

going on is that we solve run problem and then it leads to

Okay, I actually thought about bird knights but like it's
not a great name when you say it.

1400
02:18:55,490 --> 02:19:02,850
When you when you say say it aloud bird nights because like
you can't say bird nights very like if you say bird nights

1401
02:19:02,850 --> 02:19:12,950
very fast it's like it it sounds that's what it's saying
getting the perfect name is like what who the fuck said

02:19:29,410 --> 02:19:30,430
No, don't be tempted.

1405
02:19:31,250 --> 02:19:31,930
No, sorry.

1406
02:19:32,230 --> 02:19:33,250
That actually...

1407
02:19:34,390 --> 02:19:34,990
That's...

1408
02:19:38,110 --> 02:19:39,310
Welcome to...

1409
02:19:39,310 --> 02:19:40,830
Welcome, Hooters.

1410
02:19:42,170 --> 02:19:43,710
No, no, we shouldn't be.

1411
02:19:43,810 --> 02:19:44,330
I can't.

1412
02:19:44,390 --> 02:19:45,610
It's funny, but...

1413
02:19:45,610 --> 02:19:48,710
It's funny, but we can't be Hooters, guys.

1414
02:19:49,490 --> 02:19:53,730
As much as we can have transformative work now, we cannot be
Hooters.

1415
02:19:54,150 --> 02:19:56,170
That would...

1416
02:19:56,810 --> 02:19:59,030
Not be ideal for...

1417
02:20:00,550 --> 02:20:01,670
for it.

1418
02:20:02,750 --> 02:20:05,810
Deagles is good because of the emo.

1419
02:20:07,170 --> 02:20:08,570
You mean Doki Bark?

1420
02:20:08,830 --> 02:20:09,590
Oh my god.

1421
02:20:09,770 --> 02:20:19,190
I would, okay, I was so fucking I would say I was very
clever but like, I would, okay so like, so my Twitch tag,

1422
02:20:19,450 --> 02:20:23,670
like the emo like stuff, you have, it's like Doki B.

1423
02:20:24,230 --> 02:20:28,650
So then I had like I would actually make real words out of
it like Doki Bark.

1424
02:20:29,390 --> 02:20:32,110
Doki Bang, which is like Doki with a gun.

1425
02:20:32,930 --> 02:20:33,650
Doki Bread.

1426
02:20:39,230 --> 02:20:41,010
I would have like real...

1427
02:20:41,010 --> 02:20:45,570
I would just make real words out of my emotes, like, emotes
names and stuff.

1428
02:20:45,990 --> 02:20:47,310
I love Doki Bang.

1429
02:20:47,450 --> 02:20:49,310
Doki Bang is like one of my...

1430
02:20:49,310 --> 02:20:54,010
Also, like, okay, we're gonna have real emotes, but back
then, I just...

1431
02:20:54,010 --> 02:20:56,430
Back then, all I did was just...

1432
02:20:56,430 --> 02:20:59,370
I took a picture of my dog, and then I just drew...

1433
02:20:59,390 --> 02:21:00,570
expressions on

1434
02:21:06,730 --> 02:21:17,790
I was a very low effort streamer oh my god it's a very I
took a picture of my dog and then I just drew like

1435
02:21:17,790 --> 02:21:26,930
expressions on top of it and like photoshopped like items on
on on it on the emo and then my sub badges was just me

1436
02:21:26,930 --> 02:21:35,710
drawing the sub badges in MS Paint and then I just snip I
just crop crop it and then I just upload it and then

1437
02:21:35,710 --> 02:21:42,450
sometimes you can see my cursor on the sub badge and the sub
badges would be like the default sub badges but like MS

1438
02:21:42,450 --> 02:21:54,730
paint and then that's why I never thought I will get this
many people to watch me because holy fuck I was so lazy I

1439
02:21:54,730 --> 02:21:56,470
was so lazy

1440
02:21:59,710 --> 02:22:12,670

was to talk to i just wanted to talk to people that's all i

1441
02:22:12,670 --> 02:22:21,350

five four times after applying for four tat three or four

1442
02:22:21,350 --> 02:22:24,230
times this is why i never got twitch partner

1443
02:22:29,590 --> 02:22:38,590

for 90,000 people.

1447
02:23:09,000 --> 02:23:11,960
It's been 80 hooligans.

1448
02:23:14,360 --> 02:23:14,960
No, wait.

1449
02:23:15,080 --> 02:23:16,200
I feel like someone's hooligan.

1450
02:23:16,600 --> 02:23:17,380
No, not that.

1451
02:23:21,340 --> 02:23:22,000
Aviators.

1452
02:23:24,720 --> 02:23:26,380
Best ad ever.

1453
02:23:26,980 --> 02:23:27,340
Nightingale.

1454
02:23:27,440 --> 02:23:28,840
Oh my god, nightingale.

1455
02:23:28,840 --> 02:23:30,240
Oh, there's so many syllables.

1456
02:23:31,640 --> 02:23:32,240
Nightingales.

1457
02:23:32,540 --> 02:23:33,240

Uh...

1461
02:23:39,000 --> 02:23:41,100
At this point, I don't know.

1462
02:23:41,280 --> 02:23:45,440
I think there's some info that might take time to process.

1463
02:23:46,580 --> 02:23:47,100
What?

1464
02:23:56,130 --> 02:23:56,730
Wait!

1465
02:23:57,490 --> 02:23:58,490
Why can't we...

1466
02:23:58,490 --> 02:24:00,690
Why can't we not have a domain?

1467
02:24:01,330 --> 02:24:08,210
Okay, why do we need domain just go live

1468

02:25:00,390 --> 02:25:02,630
It doesn't show up.

1476
02:25:02,890 --> 02:25:06,910
The header doesn't show up Because it's not live.

1477
02:25:08,730 --> 02:25:16,710
He's like, he's like, can you please show, can you please

02:25:20,910 --> 02:25:24,650
Okay, they will see it when the shop, look, he's watching my
stream.

1480
02:25:25,010 --> 02:25:26,690
They will see it when the shop is live.

1481
02:25:26,830 --> 02:25:32,250
Anyway, it's not live, but like, this is what the shop looks
like.

1482
02:25:32,270 --> 02:25:32,710
You are.

1483
02:25:34,710 --> 02:25:37,650
Because we couldn't buy the domain.

1484
02:25:38,430 --> 02:25:41,050
Like, I was just like, what the fuck?

1485
02:25:41,630 --> 02:25:44,390

1486
02:25:46,190 --> 02:25:47,650

02:25:50,750 --> 02:25:52,990
Look at my, look at my URL.

02:25:54,050 --> 02:25:54,650
Truly.

1491
02:25:55,450 --> 02:25:58,350
And this is why I'm an indie now.

1492
02:26:00,230 --> 02:26:03,110
You can tell I'm an indie.

1493
02:26:04,710 --> 02:26:25,850

1495
02:26:34,710 --> 02:26:47,850

okay to be fair we did not expect that so many we did okay

1496
02:26:47,850 --> 02:26:57,870
to be fair we did not expect so many emails that google
locked my business account because there was too many emails

1497
02:26:57,870 --> 02:27:07,350
who the fuck expects that like i've never had that happen to
me before there is so many emails Like, Google just locked

1498
02:27:07,350 --> 02:27:08,570
it, so it never...

1499
02:27:08,570 --> 02:27:12,830
So then I had to change it to, like, his personal email.

1500
02:27:17,550 --> 02:27:22,250
Because they were like, what the fuck is wrong with your
email account?

1501
02:27:22,350 --> 02:27:23,330
Is it a bot?

1502
02:27:23,530 --> 02:27:24,870
And I'm like, oh, fuck.

1503
02:27:25,070 --> 02:27:28,730
I'm like, I did not expect so many things.

1504
02:27:29,150 --> 02:27:31,550
And also, guys, I'm sorry.

1505
02:27:31,930 --> 02:27:34,690
I saved the website because we can't...

1506
02:27:34,710 --> 02:27:35,270
Get it.

1507
02:27:35,690 --> 02:27:37,070
We couldn't launch it.

1508
02:27:41,010 --> 02:27:42,270
We couldn't.

1509
02:27:42,310 --> 02:27:44,610
I don't think I can launch it by...

1510
02:27:44,610 --> 02:27:48,850
I really don't think I can launch it by the end of the
stream.

1511
02:27:49,590 --> 02:27:51,950
Because this has been...

1512
02:27:53,090 --> 02:27:53,810
This...

1513
02:27:56,110 --> 02:28:00,610
This has took a very long time to try and get to work.

1514
02:28:02,790 --> 02:28:03,510
But...

1515
02:28:03,510 --> 02:28:04,690
When...

1516
02:28:04,710 --> 02:28:08,690
When the- I'm not gonna play a game!

1517
02:28:09,110 --> 02:28:14,730
I'm not gonna play a game!

1518
02:28:17,150 --> 02:28:20,150
That's my first- I said the first game I'm gonna do.

1519
02:28:20,310 --> 02:28:21,470
I'm not gonna play Neo Pets right now.

1520
02:28:21,550 --> 02:28:24,350
I said the very first game I'm gonna do.

1521
02:28:24,950 --> 02:28:26,930

1522
02:28:27,570 --> 02:28:30,870

1523
02:28:31,230 --> 02:28:36,470
My manager literally told me the- This- He told me to watch
TikTok.

1524
02:28:37,050 --> 02:28:39,390
Like, what the fuck?

1525
02:28:40,050 --> 02:28:41,210
Wait, look.

1526
02:28:44,210 --> 02:28:44,750

We'll figure this out after the stream.

1534
02:29:00,350 --> 02:29:02,430
We'll figure this out after the stream.

1535
02:29:03,710 --> 02:29:04,690
And then...

1536
02:29:04,710 --> 02:29:06,710
And then I'll tweet it out.

1537
02:29:06,930 --> 02:29:08,130
I'll tweet it out.

1538
02:29:09,070 --> 02:29:10,970
When it goes live.

Okay.

1567
02:31:21,270 --> 02:31:29,030
So, as y'all know, when the announcement dropped, I was just
as surprised as all of you.

1568
02:31:29,650 --> 02:31:38,110
And, um, I only found out because a friend messaged me and I
didn't even know what was in it.

1569
02:31:38,310 --> 02:31:41,950
And I read it for the first time when I went public.

1570
02:31:43,370 --> 02:31:46,990
When I still know that I did try to leave neutral.

1571
02:31:47,790 --> 02:31:54,570
Because I knew it would be very bad for everyone involved if
it went to the last possible route.

1572
02:31:56,270 --> 02:31:57,830
And I tried.

1573
02:31:58,450 --> 02:32:00,590
I really did try to try and make it neutral.

1574
02:32:01,670 --> 02:32:12,310
And I did get a lawyer because my emergency contact and I
couldn't really handle it anymore especially when I was

1575
02:32:12,310 --> 02:32:23,830
still recovering and I was lucky that I had a statement made
in advance which my lawyer helped edit in case this did

1576
02:32:23,830 --> 02:32:35,450
happen so I could respond instantly the statement that was
posted was written so I'd be safe and I can move forward and

1577
02:32:35,450 --> 02:32:38,970
restart my life while being stuck in limbo forever.

1578
02:32:41,450 --> 02:32:49,070
And I wouldn't have made the statement if the announcement
didn't go up the way it did.

1579
02:32:50,030 --> 02:32:54,450
And I was willing to keep the info hidden to the public.

1580
02:32:54,970 --> 02:32:59,590
And I never truly wanted the public to know why I was in the
hospital.

1581
02:33:00,730 --> 02:33:04,170
But I had to respond with the truth when it did went out.

1582
02:33:05,370 --> 02:33:14,750
And I know there's a lot of people that wish for me to
clarify or explain more, but I honestly can't.

1583
02:33:15,430 --> 02:33:15,910
And I'm sorry.

1584
02:33:17,130 --> 02:33:21,050
And these are the things that I can say though.

1585
02:33:21,950 --> 02:33:24,230
I was in the hospital for an attempt.

1586
02:33:25,530 --> 02:33:30,350
And I provided medical documents of everything that happened
to prove it as well.

1587
02:33:31,610 --> 02:33:33,390
As the therapy sessions afterwards.

1588
02:33:34,870 --> 02:33:35,430
evaluation.

1589
02:33:37,170 --> 02:33:45,330
Everyone knew I was in the hospital and the reason behind it
a few days before I was discharged and I was not referencing

1590
02:33:45,330 --> 02:33:54,050
something that happened once that pushed me to it but it was
a build-up that stemmed for multiple months that led to my

1591
02:33:54,050 --> 02:33:54,810
breaking point.

1592
02:33:56,690 --> 02:34:05,230
I would never make this claim to a proof or confirmation and
only did so that my lawyer looked through the proof and and

1593
02:34:05,230 --> 02:34:09,610
agreed it was happening in multiple months from what I
showed.

1594
02:34:12,010 --> 02:34:17,370
I honestly wish I could have met you all one last time and I
cried when I found that I couldn't.

1595
02:34:18,790 --> 02:34:23,790
And I hope I can still meet you on the future even if I'll
be a little different.

1596
02:34:25,830 --> 02:34:31,330
My final note on all of this is let's not harass or bully
anybody.

1597
02:34:32,490 --> 02:34:33,810
I already know how that felt.

1598
02:34:34,710 --> 02:34:46,190
and i want us to be adults and not make it high school and i
want to move on focus on us succeed and be better and the

1599
02:34:46,190 --> 02:34:55,530
lunar new year is coming and it's two new beginnings and
it's time to leave the past behind us and make new memories

1600
02:34:55,530 --> 02:35:07,190
like this entire stream i have so many ideas i still want do
and i really do want to make all you laugh for as long as i

1601
02:35:07,190 --> 02:35:21,010
can and i think from this entire stream that you guys can
tell that i'm still me and they can never really take that

1602
02:35:21,010 --> 02:35:35,290
away so yeah that was the statement that i wrote for this
stream and the The two-hour ad is finally over.

1603
02:35:40,910 --> 02:35:47,470
I think that's like a huge weight off my shoulder.

1604
02:35:50,570 --> 02:35:54,530
And it's time to move forward.

1605
02:35:56,650 --> 02:35:59,050
And celebrate Lunar New Year.

1606
02:35:59,250 --> 02:35:59,470
Yeah!

1607
02:36:00,150 --> 02:36:01,970
I mean, we could celebrate early.

1608
02:36:05,370 --> 02:36:08,070
Alright, where is it?

1609
02:36:14,210 --> 02:36:14,650
Alright,

1610
02:36:19,390 --> 02:36:27,090
when you were a little kid, your parents' fucking relatives
will always force you to do that fucking song and just be

1611
02:36:27,090 --> 02:36:28,410
like, look at how cute they are.

1612
02:36:28,790 --> 02:36:32,390
And then you do it because you're a greedy fuck that wants
more red pocket envelope.

1613
02:36:33,250 --> 02:36:35,730
You're a kid and you celebrate Lunar New Year.

1614
02:36:36,590 --> 02:36:38,170
I think it's just an Asian thing, maybe.

1615
02:36:40,110 --> 02:36:40,710
We had true.

1616
02:36:41,150 --> 02:36:47,110
We were given forward about the harsh reality of money as a
very young age.

1617
02:36:50,330 --> 02:36:52,750
But yeah, I need it.

1618
02:36:53,110 --> 02:36:58,330
I know it was a very serious statement, but I still want to
laugh with all of you.

1619
02:36:58,470 --> 02:37:06,590
I still want to make jokes because if I don't make these
jokes, Um, then it just gets too real.

1620
02:37:09,410 --> 02:37:20,030
And we're here to, you know, where life is short and I have
hope for the future now.

1621
02:37:20,890 --> 02:37:22,410
And thank you, everybody.

1622
02:37:22,550 --> 02:37:27,010

what to call you guys.
