1
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:19,700
Ah!

2
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,520
It's like I just started again!

3
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,220
We're back on the tomato farm!

4
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,020
Oh!

5
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,160
Here we are!

6
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,400
Back on the farm!

7
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:41,180
Oh, I had to get rid of my old skin suit.

8
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,120
So we're here as a tomato again.

9
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,500
My true form.

10
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,120
It is I, Doki.

11
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:59,600
So anyway, I didn't really have a time to get a new skin suit to put on.

12
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:02,940
And my old one is in the trash can over there.

13
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:06,120
So I have to dig it out real quick.

14
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,180
Uh, yeah.

15
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:10,220
You know what's the best part?

16
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,680
I can actually have a logo on the trash can!

17
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:20,490
I'm not even monetized anyway.

18
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:21,630
Like what's gonna happen?

19
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:25,330
They're gonna demonetize me because I have a logo on a trash can?

20
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:27,890
I'm not even monetized anyway!

21
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:34,330
The best part!

22
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:36,450
I googled dumpster.

23
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:38,770
Oh, is it copyright free?

24
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:43,870
Well, those are really maddening.

25
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:50,930
As long as it's a PNG!

26
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:53,870
That's all I need!

27
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:56,770
Oh my god.

28
00:05:56,830 --> 00:06:00,870
Anyway guys, let me go change real quick.

29
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:05,670
Let me go change real quick into my old suit.

30
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:07,430
It's a little fucking dirty though.

31
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:08,730
Give me a sec guys.

32
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:11,370
Give me a sec.

33
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:13,190
I gotta go change real quick.

34
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:15,850
Alright.

35
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:18,670
Gotta change into my old suit.

36
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:20,930
Just like old times.

37
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:23,790
Just like old times.

38
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:25,450
Well.

39
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:27,150
Here I go.

40
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:32,770
Alright guys.

41
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:45,210
I did warn you guys it was gonna be incredibly scuff- I did warn you guys it was gonna be incredibly scuffed.

42
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:46,610
I had two days.

43
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:48,410
I had two days.

44
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:53,210
I'm just...

45
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:54,290
Alright.

46
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:57,710
Back then, I used to talk like this.

47
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:00,970
I used to talk like this.

48
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:05,630
But now, I lost my youthful optimism.

49
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:09,090
And now I know the real world.

50
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:11,010
So now I talk like this.

51
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:12,650
But yes.

52
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:13,830
I am back now.

53
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:16,030
I am back it is I, Doki.

54
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:17,790
I've grown up.

55
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,730
I realize life is...

56
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:23,290
It's not as...

57
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:26,310
It's not as sunny as I thought it was gonna be.

58
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:28,070
It's not as sunny as I thought it was gonna be.

59
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:33,070
It's not as sunny as I thought it was gonna be.

60
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:36,830
The more I see reality, the lower my voice got.

61
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:38,510
But...

62
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:40,690
But...

63
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:43,230
I think I cried enough.

64
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:47,210
And I think, I think I cried enough that's for sure.

65
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:50,630
I had like an entire month to do that.

66
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:52,510
So obviously...

67
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:54,310
Obviously, I'm okay.

68
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:57,070
Oh, okay to be fair to be fair.

69
00:07:57,210 --> 00:08:07,950
I won't say I'm okay To be fair I am But I am surviving I am surviving and I really Okay.

70
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:10,010
Also we gotta get off the farm.

73
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:14,370

00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:35,950

79
00:08:58,030 --> 00:08:59,570
You know what we have though?

80
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:02,130
Oh shit, not like that though.

81
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:02,710
Oh my gosh.

82
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:05,410
Not the Zoom thing.

83
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:11,450
But what we have is... OBS text.

84
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:14,790
That's what we have.

85
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:18,270
So that's where all our information is gonna go.

86
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:28,930
Anyway, for those who are hoping for me to make another statement, that will be at the end of the stream.

87
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:34,890
So if you want the last statement, I would say it in the end of the stream.

88
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:40,470
For now, let's just... I haven't streamed for a month plus.

89
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:47,750
I... I haven't streamed in like so long.

90
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:52,850
I don't even... Honestly, I don't even remember how to do all of this.

91
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:54,790
Like... I don't even...

92
00:09:55,550 --> 00:10:06,090
I just... You guys should know, I had to plug in my 4-5 year old PC to get all my old... old graphics and everything.

93
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:07,470
Because I... I...

94
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:13,970
And then I had to plug in some fucking Overwatch keyboard.

95
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:15,870
Just to be like...

96
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:16,310
Because I...

97
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,010
I was the only keyboard.

98
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:19,350
With a cable.

99
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:20,970
It was so dusty.

100
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:21,610
It was like...

101
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:23,930
That keyboard was like 7 years old.

102
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:26,350
I... It was... It was a lot.

103
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:27,830
It was... It was a lot.

104
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:28,770
And...

105
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:29,810
It's like...

106
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:30,890
I was like...

107
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:32,290
Where... Where... What?

108
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:35,370
I didn't even organize any of those files.

109
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:38,550
It was just all in one download file.

110
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:40,790
I was like... It was in a download...

111
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:43,590
Okay, everything... I put everything in a downloads folder.

112
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:45,070
Because back then...

113
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:46,070
Um...

114
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:47,710
4 years ago...

115
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:47,990
Dota...

116
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:48,250
I was like...

117
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:50,830
Never give a fuck about organizing anything.

118
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:54,290
So everything was just in a folder called downloads.

119
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:55,830
So then I was like...

120
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:57,350
What the fuck did I use?

121
00:10:57,530 --> 00:10:59,950
So I had to deal with that...

122
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:00,750
For a bit.

123
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:02,090
And then...

124
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:03,290
And then I was like...

125
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:03,870
Oh my...

126
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:06,290
Oh my god.

127
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:07,290
Okay, it was just...

128
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:07,810
Oh my god.

129
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:08,890
And then all these new...

130
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:10,590
Technology...

131
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:11,390
God, I'm...

132
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:15,650
Oh my god.

133
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:16,530
This girl got potential.

134
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:17,470
Thank you.

135
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:17,990
I'm so happy.

136
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:19,210
Thank you.

137
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:21,410
I really...

138
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:23,310
I really appreciate that.

139
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:24,730
Anyway...

140
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:26,650
Anyway...

141
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:27,450
So...

142
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:28,310
Um...

143
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:32,870
It's just...

144
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:33,930
It's a lot.

145
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:35,610
I really...

146
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:38,550
I saw how many people were in the waiting room.

147
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:39,650
And I was like...

148
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:40,230
Oh fuck.

149
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:40,630
Okay.

150
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:42,430
I haven't like...

151
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:43,390
Talked to...

152
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:44,850
This many people...

153
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:45,490
In...

154
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:46,510
So long.

155
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:47,890
I...

156
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:47,970
I...

157
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:48,750
Let's just...

158
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:51,350
You guys wanna know my schedule before then?

159
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:53,810
This was my schedule before then?

160
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,710
I wake up...

161
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:57,750
It's 7 p.m.

162
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:04,090
I wake up...

163
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:06,490
It's 7 p.m.

164
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:08,010
I...

165
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:09,870
I eat...

166
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:10,470
D...

167
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:11,430
I eat lunch.

168
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:17,750
I eat lunch.

169
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:18,110
Lunch.

170
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:20,250
I play video games.

171
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:22,430
It's 4am.

172
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:24,450
I eat dinner.

173
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:33,470
And then I play until I'm so fucking tired that I pass out.

174
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:39,490
That was the most healthiest schedule I had for almost a month straight.

175
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:40,610
Wasn't that...

176
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:50,330
And so, what I saw, I saw, I was like, oh my god.

177
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:52,150
Now to...

178
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:55,510
Don't make it depressing, Doki.

179
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:56,750
Don't make it...

180
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:06,490
Don't make it depressing, Doki.

181
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:07,110
Please.

182
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:09,750
They wanna watch anime girls.

183
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:12,030
To escape from reality.

184
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:15,650
I'm sorry, I need to...

185
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:18,410
I need to get back into the groove of things, guys.

186
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:19,690
I'm so sorry.

187
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:21,470
I'm so sorry.

188
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:22,350
Anyway.

189
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:24,450
But...

190
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:26,150
You know what's funny?

191
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:29,010
I actually just came back from therapy.

192
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:30,730
And...

193
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:33,410
Yeah, I have weekly therapy now because, you know...

194
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:36,530
That definitely sounded so healthy, right?

195
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:39,110
So, anyway.

196
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:41,750
I came back from therapy.

197
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:44,510
And then my therapist was like...

198
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:46,690
Wow, Doki.

199
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:50,450
You are... You sound so different.

200
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:51,950
And I was like...

201
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:52,710
Yeah.

202
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:55,870
I got 32 days to get...

203
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:01,300
I was like...

204
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:03,620
Yeah.

205
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,280
But like...

206
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,280
I can...

207
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,040
I can do stuff now.

208
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,160
So...

209
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,360
And then...

210
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,280
And then...

211
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:14,840
But...

212
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:15,700
But...

213
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:16,440
But I was like...

214
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,080
But...

215
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,460
I'm streaming...

216
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:19,840
I'm streaming today.

217
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:23,080
And then he was like...

218
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:25,060
He was like...

219
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:25,620
Wow.

220
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,180
You know...

221
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,920
Like, I can tell you have a...

222
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:30,980
You're grounded now.

223
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:32,280
And it's like...

224
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,940
It's like you have a purpose.

225
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,640
And like...

226
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:36,220
He's right.

227
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,360
Because like...

228
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,500
I can stream now.

229
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:39,360
I have...

230
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:39,900
Okay.

231
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,860
I actually...

232
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:43,400
Even though...

233
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,060
Now it's a serious note.

234
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,520
That is my segue to the serious note thing.

235
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,080
But basically...

236
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,300
I do have...

237
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:51,480
I have a purpose now.

238
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,260
I do.

239
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:56,020
I'm not playing video games until...

240
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:58,120
Looking at 11 in the morning.

241
00:14:58,980 --> 00:14:59,580
Anymore.

242
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,720
I actually have stuff I want to do again.

243
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:03,940
I actually have goals.

244
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:06,520
I actually have things I want to do.

245
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,440
Things I want to play.

246
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,860
Things I want to...

247
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:10,680
Plan.

248
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,460
It's actually crazy.

249
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:13,360
I...

250
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,440
The moment...

251
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,600
The moment...

252
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,240
I was finally free...

253
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:18,580
Like...

254
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:20,340
I have so many ideas...

255
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:21,540
In my mind.

256
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:22,340
And I was...

257
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:23,200
I was so hap...

258
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:23,580
Okay.

259
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,820
I was not so happy.

260
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:25,280
Okay.

261
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:26,300
I cried.

262
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:30,720
I shouldn't say I was so happy.

263
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:32,120
I was like...

264
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:34,720
I was happier than what I was a month ago.

265
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,000
That's for sure.

266
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:37,600
I was happier.

267
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:38,420
I was so happy.

268
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:38,760
Anyway.

269
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:40,800
I was...

270
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,420
I actually have a vision.

271
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:44,300
And everything.

272
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:45,340
So like...

273
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:45,980
He wasn't wrong.

274
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:46,620
Like...

275
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:47,260
Instead of...

276
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:48,980
Not knowing...

277
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:50,780
What my life was gonna be...

278
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:52,260
At least now...

279
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:54,540
I know where my life is going to be now.

280
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:55,640
So...

281
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:56,640
He was right.

282
00:15:58,340 --> 00:15:59,600
And then...

283
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,520
And then he was like...

284
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:02,880
So...

285
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,080
Like...

286
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,100
How's your channel?

287
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:06,360
I was like...

288
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:06,960
Oh like...

289
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:08,400
I got a new channel.

290
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,580
He got 300K subscribers in 2 days.

291
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:11,740
He was like...

292
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:12,040
What the...

293
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:17,510
He was like...

294
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:18,750
What?!

295
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:19,690
What the...

296
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:24,170
He was like...

297
00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:25,790
Okay.

298
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:28,690
Yeah.

299
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:31,330
And he was like...

300
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:31,890
That's insane.

301
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:34,090
I was like...

302
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:34,490
Yeah.

303
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:40,250
But...

304
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:40,810
Yeah.

305
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:40,990
He was just like...

306
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:41,870
Yeah, anyway...

307
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:46,050
So, it is actually...

308
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:48,650
Honestly, it's...

309
00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:51,490
What looking forward...

310
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:53,110
In the future...

311
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:54,750
The future plans...

312
00:16:55,170 --> 00:16:56,410
As Mia's doki...

313
00:16:56,410 --> 00:16:57,870
Is that...

314
00:16:58,310 --> 00:16:59,370
I do have...

315
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:01,310
A lot of ideas going in.

316
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:02,130
Oh my god!

317
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:03,190
Okay, so...

318
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:05,210
You know how there's a business inquiries...

319
00:17:05,210 --> 00:17:05,970
Thing?

320
00:17:07,090 --> 00:17:09,350
Apparently we got too many inquiries...

321
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:11,590
That Google thought it was a bot.

322
00:17:11,850 --> 00:17:12,410
account.

323
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:15,830
So...

324
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:18,950
By the way, I have a manager.

325
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:21,530
Well, I can't say manager-san...

326
00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:22,330
Because he's not Japanese.

327
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:24,170
He's American.

328
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:27,130
So it would be weird to call him manager-san.

329
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:29,010
But...

330
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:30,790
But...

331
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:33,510
We made...

332
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:34,750
You know, we had like...

333
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:36,950
You know, like... business inquiries.

334
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:39,050
There's like...

335
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:40,930
You know, the email doki can read.

336
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:42,450
And then like...

337
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:44,630
I got like a message be like...

338
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:44,790
Hey!

339
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:46,650
Like, our emails are bouncing.

340
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:49,550
So I'm gonna like DM you about this.

341
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:50,890
And I was like... What?

342
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:52,750
And then... Oh, Mr. Manager.

343
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:54,210
Yeah, Mr. Manager.

344
00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:54,910
No, really?

345
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:55,570
That's too many syllables.

346
00:17:55,810 --> 00:17:56,570
What the fuck are you...

347
00:17:56,570 --> 00:17:58,450
That's too many syllables.

348
00:17:58,650 --> 00:18:00,050
Like, it has to like...

349
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:02,870
Manage... Sorry, I forgot account either.

350
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:05,050
Like... I never had...

351
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:07,930
I just had to... I was just playing video games.

352
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:09,330
Like, what the fuck do I need accounting for?

353
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:10,850
Alright, Manager...

354
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:11,350
San.

355
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:12,830
Okay, it has to be four syllables.

356
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:14,210
Mr. Manager.

357
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:15,310
That's five syllables.

358
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:16,190
That's way too many syllables.

359
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:18,270
Mr. Man.

360
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:23,310
Okay, Mr. Man.

361
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:23,950
Alright, sorry.

362
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:24,650
Mr. Man.

363
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:27,290
Um... I was like...

364
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:28,070
What the fuck's going on?

365
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:29,090
The emails are bouncing.

366
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:30,830
And he was like...

367
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:32,110
Oh, shit.

368
00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:34,770
We're...

369
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:36,210
We have too many...

370
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:39,290
Google flagged the email account.

371
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:40,390
So like...

372
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:42,350
We're gonna have to use my personal email.

373
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:43,870
I was just like...

374
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:45,630
Alright, this isn't... Alright, whatever.

375
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:47,270
This is not gonna look professional.

376
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:48,590
But at this point...

377
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:53,450
We need a business email going on there.

378
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:54,170
So I'm really...

379
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:57,610
I'm really sorry about the business inquiries.

380

383
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:04,250
Um...

00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:06,290
We're waiting for Google to like...

00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:24,410

Okay.

395
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:26,590
Anyway...

396
00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:30,410

So I talked about this in...

400
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:38,810
If you were lucky in...

401
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:41,430
If you were lucky and you were in...

402
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,950
The chat whenever I popped by...

403
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:46,470
I gave like little tidbits of updates...

404
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:47,470
Every so often.

405
00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:48,810
Um...

406
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:50,710
Um...

407
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:53,990
When he told me...

408
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:55,030
The thing is...

409
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:57,070
I was so...

410
00:19:58,210 --> 00:19:59,790
I guess like...

411
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:00,790
What's the right word?

412
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:01,950
What's the right word?

413
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:02,810
I was so...

414
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:04,530
I guess shocked?

415
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:06,410
I was like...

416
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:09,250
And like... I don't know.

417
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:10,690
I don't know how to describe this feeling.

418
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:12,070
But...

419
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:13,950
When he was like, what are you gonna do?

420
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:16,970
And I was like... I wanna do so many projects.

421
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:18,910
I wanna host events.

422
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:21,510
I wanna host events...

423
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:23,710
With so many different...

424
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:25,270

425
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:27,290
Different companies in...

426
00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:28,010
In the West.

427
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:29,350
And everything.

428
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:31,090
And then...

429
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:34,950
Mr. Man was like...

430
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:36,070
Uh...

431
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:37,210
Uh...

432
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:40,950
What's... Did you...

433
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:42,930
Okay, I'm trying to like phrase this better.

434
00:20:43,730 --> 00:20:44,110
Okay...

435
00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:47,290
Sorry, I haven't talked this much...

436
00:20:47,290 --> 00:20:48,210
In a long time either.

437
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:48,730
Like...

438
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:49,050
I don't...

439
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:52,870
I was not...

440
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:54,630
I have not talked in a long time.

441
00:20:55,370 --> 00:20:55,890
And...

442
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:57,350
And then...

443
00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:00,090
He was like...

444
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:01,910
We can get sponsors for that.

445
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:03,850
I was like... Huh?

446
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:06,250
And he was like...

447
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:08,810
Yeah, you don't have to pay out of your own pocket anymore.

448
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:10,670
I was like...

449
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:12,150
What?

450
00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:24,050
I was just like...

451
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:25,690
I was like...

452
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:26,230
Wait...

453
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:26,630
Huh?

454
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:28,510
And...

455
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:30,070
That blew my mind.

456
00:21:30,170 --> 00:21:31,910
That blew my mind.

457
00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:33,890
By the way...

458
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:36,230
Mark is like...

459
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:38,690
My mom scolded me about this because...

460
00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:40,950
You know, during all of this...

461
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:42,390
During...

462
00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:44,750
During all of this...

463
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:45,570
Um...

464
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:47,970
She looked at my financials...

465
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:50,890
And I made zero profit last year.

466
00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:51,890
And I made zero profit last year.

467
00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:55,850
And I spent it all.

468
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:00,940
And I spent it all.

469
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:03,400
She was like...

470
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:07,680
And I spent it all.

471
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,140
And I spent it all.

472
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:09,140
And she was like...

473
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:12,860
She was like...

474
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:14,040
You have to spend less.

475
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:16,180
You have to spend less.

476
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:16,380
Because...

477
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,620
Because...

478
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:21,040
You spent...

479
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:23,300
You spent...

480
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,160
$200 ,000...

481
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:27,420
Last year.

482
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:27,900
Last year.

483
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:30,880
And I...

484
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,380
And I...

485
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:35,640
I was like...

486
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,860
I was like...

487
00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:43,170
That hurt.

488
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:45,270
Oh...

489
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:45,910
That hurt.

490
00:22:47,370 --> 00:22:48,670
But then...

491
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:50,750
When Mr. Mad was like...

492
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:53,190
All those projects you want to do...

493
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:54,970
All of that...

494
00:22:54,970 --> 00:22:55,990
You want to do...

495
00:22:57,130 --> 00:22:58,530
You don't have to...

496
00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:00,530
You won't be spending...

497
00:23:00,530 --> 00:23:01,990
$200,000.

498
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:04,590
I was...

499
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:11,590
I was so...

500
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:12,630
I was...

501
00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:14,310
I just blew my mind.

502
00:23:14,850 --> 00:23:15,250
I...

503
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:18,110
I just blew my mind.

504
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:20,810
I couldn't believe it.

505
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:22,050
I...

506
00:23:23,290 --> 00:23:25,050
I couldn't believe...

507
00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:26,870
Those were my expenses...

508
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:28,190
Last year.

509
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:31,970
I just...

510
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:33,570
I just really like...

511
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:35,570
I just really like projects.

512
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:37,710
I have a problem.

513
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:38,690
I have...

514
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:40,330
I have a problem.

515
00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:40,790
I have a problem.

516
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:42,590
Oh my god.

517
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:44,110
Anyway...

518
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:46,250

00:24:57,890 --> 00:24:59,670
At least twice a day.

558
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:02,950

00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:05,090

575
00:25:32,450 --> 00:25:34,850
My friends over at...

576
00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:36,410
Apex and EA...

577
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:38,090
Also... They like...

578
00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:39,350
You know like...

579
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:42,630
When I put up the waiting room...

580
00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:43,830
For the stream...

581
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:46,230
One of the Apex...

582
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:48,650
One of the Apex staff members...

583
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:50,150
Like messaged me...

584
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:51,410
And was like...

585
00:25:51,410 --> 00:25:53,550
Sending them their support...

586
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:56,030
And was like saying...

587
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:58,670
Was like screenshotting the chat's waiting room...

588
00:25:58,670 --> 00:25:59,310
And stuff...

589
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:01,550
And was just...

590
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:02,670
Just...

591
00:26:02,670 --> 00:26:06,210
Just being so supportive and everything...

592
00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:07,130
And...

593
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:10,690
I... It was just... Oh my gosh...

594
00:26:10,690 --> 00:26:11,610
I...

595
00:26:11,610 --> 00:26:15,730
I honestly...

596
00:26:15,730 --> 00:26:18,270
I just... Everything...

597
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:19,130
I don't know... I...

598
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:22,890
I didn't expect...

599
00:26:22,890 --> 00:26:23,690
Really...

600
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:26,630
I felt like it was like...

601
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:27,410
You know...

602
00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:30,010
End of the world...

603
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:32,880
It's hard to be hopeful after what happened...

604
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:34,150
You know...

605
00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:36,430
It's hard... It's hard...

606
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:38,010
To be hopeful...

607
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:40,650
I honestly...

608
00:26:40,650 --> 00:26:42,390
But then... Then I saw...

609
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:44,690
So many support...

610
00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:46,370
And all the love...

611
00:26:46,370 --> 00:26:48,450
And all the messages...

612
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:49,410
I got...

613
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:52,030
Throughout the past two days...

614
00:26:53,090 --> 00:26:54,090
And...

615
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:56,750
And...

616
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:58,290
I'm honestly... I'm...

617
00:26:58,290 --> 00:27:00,630
I'm just so overwhelmed...

618
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:02,110
I've been so...

619
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:03,470
So overwhelmed...

620
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:06,050
And I want to say thank you everybody...

621
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:07,650
I don't... I...

622
00:27:07,650 --> 00:27:09,570
I don't know what to do about you guys...

623
00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:12,590
I'm just... I'm just a fucking...

624
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:14,550
Stupid girl...

625
00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:25,810
I'm just...

626
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:28,230
It's crazy... It really...

627
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:30,730
It really is... And...

628
00:27:32,090 --> 00:27:33,050
I...

629
00:27:34,430 --> 00:27:36,370
I really did feel very hopeless...

630
00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:37,830
For...

631
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:39,710
For a while now...

632
00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:43,070
And... And just to see all this love...

633
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:44,030
And...

634
00:27:44,490 --> 00:27:45,110
Being...

635
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:47,830
I guess like...

636
00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:51,310
More positive about my future now...

637
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:52,730
And also...

638
00:27:52,730 --> 00:27:54,730
Oh my god...

639
00:27:54,730 --> 00:27:56,670
Oh my...

640
00:27:56,670 --> 00:27:58,250
Oh my...

641
00:27:58,250 --> 00:28:00,430
It's just...

642
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:01,010
It's just...

643
00:28:01,010 --> 00:28:03,610
It's hard to like...

644
00:28:03,610 --> 00:28:04,850
Put things in words...

645
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:06,630
I'm like stammering and...

646
00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:09,470
And pausing so much because...

647
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:11,830
It's really hard to put...

648
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:13,650
Words into...

649
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:15,010
The emotion...

650
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:17,490
Like I feel right now...

651
00:28:17,490 --> 00:28:18,730
And...

652
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:21,950
Really... I know I keep saying thank you...

653
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:23,010
I keep saying thank you...

654
00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:23,810
I keep saying thank you...

655
00:28:23,810 --> 00:28:27,510
But really... Thank you everyone...

656
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:29,050
I...

657
00:28:29,610 --> 00:28:31,950
I really... I'm lining up...

658
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:33,070
A lot of...

659
00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:35,150
Collabs for...

660
00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:36,730
Next week...

661
00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:39,550
Um... Because I really...

662
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:42,070
Want to get back into swing of things...

663
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:43,450
And...

664
00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:45,450
Really I just...

665
00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:47,670
I wanna...

666
00:28:47,670 --> 00:28:49,530
I really miss streaming...

667
00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:51,470
I really... really...

668
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:52,070
Do...

669
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:54,650
When I wasn't...

670
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:57,690
I wasn't online streaming...

671
00:28:57,690 --> 00:28:59,530
During those...

672
00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:02,050
Long fucking days...

673
00:29:02,050 --> 00:29:02,470
Haha...

674
00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:05,270
Oh my god... During those...

675
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:06,710
It...

676
00:29:07,610 --> 00:29:09,250
Felt... I was...

677
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:10,610
Very miserable...

678
00:29:11,610 --> 00:29:13,070
Because... I honestly...

679
00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:15,310
I really do enjoy streaming...

680
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:17,650
I really enjoy talking to all...

681
00:29:17,650 --> 00:29:19,670
You guys... I really enjoy doing...

682
00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:20,830
Okay...

683
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:22,990
What I found figured out...

684
00:29:23,610 --> 00:29:24,590
Is that...

685
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:26,550
I...

686
00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:29,770
Do not like playing video games...

687
00:29:29,770 --> 00:29:30,730
If I'm not like...

688
00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:32,990
Single player... Okay I try to play...

689
00:29:33,610 --> 00:29:35,130
I... I tried...

690
00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:37,690
I try to play single player games...

691
00:29:37,690 --> 00:29:39,880
With nobody watching me...

692
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:41,450
But it was not...

693
00:29:41,450 --> 00:29:43,150
The same... It was...

694
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:46,030
It was not the same...

695
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:48,030
And you know what I did?

696
00:29:48,850 --> 00:29:49,810
I would...

697
00:29:49,810 --> 00:29:51,610
I would drag my friends...

698
00:29:52,330 --> 00:29:52,990
And a...

699
00:29:52,990 --> 00:29:55,370
In like a discord call...

700
00:29:55,370 --> 00:29:57,730
And I'd be like... Watch me play...

701
00:29:57,730 --> 00:29:59,470
And then... Listen to me...

702
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:00,850
Commentate...

703
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:01,770
Hahaha...

704
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:05,690
Hahaha...

705
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:07,330
Hahaha...

706
00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:08,370
I was like...

707
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:11,610
Alright... You're gonna pretend to be my chat...

708
00:30:12,290 --> 00:30:13,290
And I'm gonna be...

709
00:30:13,290 --> 00:30:15,710
Commentating while I play this game...

710
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:17,250
Hahaha...

711
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:19,430
Oh my god... Okay... I saw someone said...

712
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:20,830
Chat was like... Without the...

713
00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:21,570
Yes!

714
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:23,790
Oh my god...

715
00:30:23,790 --> 00:30:25,070
There was game I was playing...

716
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:27,950
And I literally dragged one of my friends...

717
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:29,570
To watch me play this game...

718
00:30:29,570 --> 00:30:31,700
So like... When we got to the puzzle parts...

719
00:30:32,170 --> 00:30:33,390
I would be like...

720
00:30:33,610 --> 00:30:35,390
Backseat me...

721
00:30:35,390 --> 00:30:36,070
Hahaha...

722
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:37,750
Like...

723
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:43,100
Hahaha... I'd be like...

724
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:44,600
What's the answer?

725
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:46,960
Hahaha... It's...

726
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,540
Backseating time...

727
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:50,660
So... Um...

728
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,860
I do miss that...

729
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:55,540
I actually... I really do miss the backseating...

730
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:57,600
I can't think for myself...

731
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,480
I can't... But like...

732
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:00,860
Oh my god...

733
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:03,040

00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:09,780
Okay... We're not gonna have a stream tomorrow...

737
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:11,820
Because...

738
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:13,500
I only... Okay...

739
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:14,220
So...

740
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:17,540
I was just like... I need a stream...

00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:19,180
But I can't stream tomorrow... Like you know...

742
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:20,880
When the fucking news dropped...

743
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,980
I was like... Do I stream tomorrow?

744
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:24,160
Or the day after tomorrow?

745
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:27,100
Because you know... It was like...

746
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:29,500
Fucking... 5 in the morning...

747
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:31,380
So I was like...

748
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:32,680
Okay...

749
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:34,340
We're gonna do the day after tomorrow...

750
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:36,800
Because... I need to process...

751
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,680
All of this... Because I'm not processing...

752
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,380
Anything... So...

753
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:42,680
So I was just like...

754
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:44,540
Alright...

00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:50,100
My first stream...

758
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:52,660
And I'm just... I need to slowly get into it...

759
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:55,740
But next week is gonna be our very first schedule...

760
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:56,340

00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,760
Schedule templates... Thank you so much...

763
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:02,400
For using Doki Gallery...

764
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,440
Because I saw so many assets...

765
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:05,500
And everything...

00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:10,900
Um... I need to find...

768
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:11,780
A schedule...

769
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:15,100
Assets... I know there are more schedule assets...

770
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,500
For those who made...

771
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:19,080
A schedule assets... Can you guys make it into like...

772
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:19,960
The square?

773
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:22,320
Because it fits into like...

774
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,000
I like it when it's not...

775
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,220
Landscape... But like...

776
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:27,280
You know the square?

777
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:30,540
I don't know how to describe it... You know the square shape...

778
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:32,580
Instead of the landscape... It's not... Was it...

779
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:33,000
Full square?

780
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:34,740
I don't... Guys it's been so long...

781
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:36,560
I don't even remember what like...

782
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:37,200
You know...

783
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:40,480
Back then looked like... I... I need to choose...

784
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,260
I don't... I'm trying to choose words carefully...

785
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:43,360
Because like... I don't know what...

786
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,360
What vocabulary it is anymore...

787
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:48,740
Portrait...

788
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:50,460
But it's not full portrait...

789
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:52,120
It's like... I don't know...

790
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:54,240
You know... What it looks like...

791
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,880
What it looks nice on mobile type deal...

792
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,860
Like I know there was a lot of landscape ones...

793
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:00,680
But like... I would like...

794
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,220
The non landscape...

795
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:03,760
It was not... Was it full portrait?

796
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:04,680
Size dimensions?

797
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,380
I don't remember...

798
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:07,300
Anyway...

799
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:10,660
Anyway... Yes... 4 to 3...

00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:11,500
Thank you...

801
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:11,880
See?

802
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,540
This is why I need a stream... If I was by myself...

803
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:16,260
I wouldn't have that...

804
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:16,800
Like...

805
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:19,520
Like...

806
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:20,420
Like...

807
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:24,380
This is exactly why people need a stream...

808
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:26,580
Like... I'm not gonna think for myself...

809
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:28,160
I can literally like... I can like...

810
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,840
Literally make someone else think for me...

811
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,900
Umm... And that's why...

812
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:33,820
It's a 4 by 3... There we go...

813
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:36,320
Anyway... Umm...

814
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:37,720

825
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,220

And I was... I... I was just... I was so emotional...

841
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,060
I was so emotional...

842
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:40,880
When all of you guys started posting old artwork...

843
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,740

847
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:50,580

When this all happened...

1020
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:25,660
But... Basically...

1021
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:29,240
Obviously... My DMs are...

00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:31,000

But... Obviously...

00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:05,080
Throughout all of this... That happened...

1041
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:06,820
Throughout all of this that happened...

1042
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:09,740
Obviously...

1043
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:13,140

There was a lot going on... But one... One of them...

1048
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:22,900
It was...

1049
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:25,080
Entertainment at that point... Because... Like...

1050
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:26,880
It just got funnier...

1051
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,640
And funnier as it went on...

1052
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:30,880
Uh... But basically...

1053
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,660
Uh... They were like...

1054
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:34,260
You live in Canada!

1055
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:36,320
And I...

You're Canadian!

1065
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:55,960
And I'm like... Okay... So...

At that point I was just like...

You know...

00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,820
At that point you sort of feel a bit... Sorry...

1075
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:15,880
Hahahaha...

1076
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:18,740
Because... Like...

1106
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:16,800

That's Mr. Man's job...

1111
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:28,560
Not my job...

1112
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:31,400
Um... But... There's gonna be...

1113
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:32,900

1120
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:46,620
And then send it back to me...

1121
00:43:46,620 --> 00:43:48,720
So... Um...

1122
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:51,260
Don't write anything too weird...

1123
00:43:51,260 --> 00:43:52,960
Because... He's gonna...

1124
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:54,360
Read all of it...

1125
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:55,100
He's gonna...

00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:58,200
You know... He's gonna read it...

1127
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:00,560

00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:28,640
Therapist next week and be like...

1142
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:30,700
So yeah... My manager sent me...

1143
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:31,920
Hate mail... Um...

1144
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:34,820
I don't really know what that means in general...

1145
00:44:34,820 --> 00:44:36,820
Or like... What he really thinks about me...

1146
00:44:36,820 --> 00:44:37,280
So...

1147
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:40,640
So...

1148
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:42,660
So...

1149
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:44,460
Uh... So yes...

1150
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:46,940
Anyway... I like how all I wrote was...

1151
00:44:46,940 --> 00:44:47,780
Birthday...

1152
00:44:48,580 --> 00:44:50,780
I... I actually had like other stuff...

1153
00:44:50,780 --> 00:44:52,220
I want... Okay... Give me a sec...

1154
00:44:52,220 --> 00:44:54,140
I wrote all of this down...

1155
00:44:54,140 --> 00:44:57,120
I was like... Here is the plan...

1156
00:44:57,120 --> 00:44:58,840
Doki... Here is the...

1157
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:00,560
Plan... On like...

1158
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:02,880
Where you're supposed to go with all of this...

1159
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:04,600
Which is... Okay...

1160
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:06,160
I just want you guys to know...

1161
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:08,560
Plan... What I wrote for...

1162
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:10,740
The plan... Is...

1163
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:12,320
Birthday...

1164
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:15,020
Doxy story...

1165
00:45:15,020 --> 00:45:16,880
Doki Doge...

1166
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:18,360
Tags...

1167
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:19,920
That's the... That's the...

1168
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:22,080
Where it's leading to...

1169
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:24,780
Anyway... Um...

1170
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:27,180
Doki Doge...

1171
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:28,920
Doki Doge...

1172
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:30,660
Which came first?

1173
00:45:30,700 --> 00:45:32,820
Of course I love my...

1174
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:33,180
Well...

1175
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:35,960
Now I love myself again...

1176
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:39,680
We gotta be realistic here...

1177
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:40,560
Um...

1178
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:40,960
Um...

1179
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:45,760
I love myself again...

1180
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:46,700
So...

1181
00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:48,100
But back then...

1182
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:49,960
I really loved myself...

1183
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:52,640
So... When I got Doki Doge...

1184
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:54,760
I named him after me...

1185
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:55,420
So...

1186
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:56,920
Doki Doge...

1187
00:45:57,800 --> 00:45:59,200
Doki Doge...

1188
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:01,800
But then...

1189
00:46:02,580 --> 00:46:04,820
It might get a little confusing...

1190
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:07,120
So...

1191
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:08,240
Because...

1192
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:10,160
You know... Doki Doge...

1193
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:11,840
It might get a little bit confusing...

1194
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:14,440
Also... There's like... It's just too many D's...

1195
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:16,240
So...

1196
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:18,580
We might give him a little nickname...

1197
00:46:18,580 --> 00:46:21,020
It... Just to distinguish between...

1198
00:46:21,020 --> 00:46:22,720
Doki 1 and Doki 2...

1199
00:46:23,420 --> 00:46:24,700
And I'm very willing...

1200
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:26,440
Uh...

1201
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:28,120
To let you guys decide...

1202
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:30,680
What... Doki Doge...

1203
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:32,360
Nickname is...

1204
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:34,940
So you guys...

1205
00:46:34,940 --> 00:46:35,780
Can decide...

1206
00:46:35,780 --> 00:46:37,440
Doki Doge's nickname...

1207
00:46:38,540 --> 00:46:39,540
Guys...

1208
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:41,620
You guys can decide...

1209
00:46:41,620 --> 00:46:43,040
Oh my god...

1210
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:43,940
Don't be so...

1211
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:48,600
Guys...

1212
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:51,660
I'm trying to like...

1213
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:54,360
Guys... You guys can decide...

1214
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:56,360
Doki Doge's nickname...

1215
00:46:56,360 --> 00:46:57,480
That I'll be using...

1216
00:46:57,480 --> 00:46:58,760
On stream...

1217
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:00,800
Just so we can distinguish...

1218
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:04,120
Doki 2...

1219
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:06,160
Oh my god...

1220
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:07,840
Amuse Glacier...

1221
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:10,500
What a great suggestion...

1222
00:47:14,260 --> 00:47:16,420
Through random picking...

1223
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:18,220
Through...

1224
00:47:18,220 --> 00:47:19,600
Through...

1225
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:21,400
Sheer randomness...

1226
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:23,340
And random picking...

1227
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:25,620
I feel like... I don't know...

1228
00:47:25,620 --> 00:47:27,860
I feel like... For some reason...

1229
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:31,280
We can call him...

1230
00:47:32,620 --> 00:47:34,500
Doki Ember Doge...

1231
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:35,600
Oh no!

1232
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:37,220
Thank you Glacier...

1233
00:47:37,220 --> 00:47:39,180
I just closed my eyes...

1234
00:47:39,180 --> 00:47:41,660
And like... Picked one name on random...

1235
00:47:41,660 --> 00:47:43,560
But like... It's spelled with an A...

1236
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:44,800
Just so you guys know...

1237
00:47:45,460 --> 00:47:47,420
Doki Ember Doge...

1238
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:49,580
What is this?

1239
00:47:49,860 --> 00:47:51,560
Oh sorry... That's Twitch Alert...

1240
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:53,720
Because I haven't set up YouTube Alerts yet...

1241
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:55,400
I haven't...

1242
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:56,660
I haven't set up YouTube Alerts yet...

1243
00:47:56,660 --> 00:47:56,720
I haven't set up YouTube Alerts yet...

1244
00:47:59,780 --> 00:48:00,420
So...

1245
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:02,500
You can call Doki Doge...

1246
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:03,200
Amber...

1247
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:04,280
If you like...

1248
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:06,520
Also like... It helps out...

1249
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:09,340
Because I really don't want to say Doki Doge or Doki a lot...

1250
00:48:09,340 --> 00:48:12,260
So... His middle name is now...

1251
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,640
Doki Ember Doge...

1252
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:15,920
Amber for short...

1253
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:17,040
So... And he...

1254
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:20,000
I feel like he's like... Super used to it anyway...

1255
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:20,640
At this point...

1256
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:23,580
He's like...

1257
00:48:23,580 --> 00:48:23,620
He's like...

1258
00:48:23,620 --> 00:48:24,140
He's like...

1259
00:48:27,970 --> 00:48:28,410
He's like...

1260
00:48:28,410 --> 00:48:28,490
Anyway...

1261
00:48:30,850 --> 00:48:32,230
This is how scuffed it was...

1262
00:48:32,230 --> 00:48:33,070
I didn't even set up...

1263
00:48:33,070 --> 00:48:35,150
I didn't even set up like...

1264
00:48:35,150 --> 00:48:36,690
YouTube Alerts...

1265
00:48:36,690 --> 00:48:38,270
Because I was like...

1266
00:48:38,950 --> 00:48:40,510
I'm not even monetized...

1267
00:48:40,510 --> 00:48:42,930
So I'll just set up Twitch Alerts...

1268
00:48:42,930 --> 00:48:44,590
Like I mean I had Twitch Alerts...

1269
00:48:44,590 --> 00:48:46,450
So I was just like...

1270
00:48:47,290 --> 00:48:49,090
Just... Whenever I got monetized...

1271
00:48:53,170 --> 00:48:53,810
I was like...

1272
00:48:53,810 --> 00:48:54,190
Yay...

1273
00:48:56,610 --> 00:48:57,250
Tags...

1274
00:48:57,250 --> 00:48:59,190
I really... I was...

1275
00:48:59,190 --> 00:49:01,690
The only one I have so far...

1276
00:49:02,390 --> 00:49:02,970
Is...

1277
00:49:03,990 --> 00:49:05,270
Doki Gallery...

1278
00:49:05,270 --> 00:49:07,410
I didn't want to put art on there...

1279
00:49:07,410 --> 00:49:09,210
Because... I don't know...

1280
00:49:09,210 --> 00:49:11,030
For some reason...

1281
00:49:11,030 --> 00:49:12,650
I realized...

1282
00:49:12,650 --> 00:49:14,930
I don't know... From research I guess...

1283
00:49:14,930 --> 00:49:17,890
That when you put art in any art tag...

1284
00:49:17,890 --> 00:49:19,630
Like the word art in there...

1285
00:49:20,290 --> 00:49:20,610
It...

1286
00:49:22,390 --> 00:49:23,770
Oh my god... Dad...

1287
00:49:25,070 --> 00:49:25,950
Hahahaha...

1288
00:49:27,730 --> 00:49:28,610
Hahahaha...

1289
00:49:28,610 --> 00:49:28,670
Hahahaha...

1290
00:49:30,970 --> 00:49:31,850
Um...

1291
00:49:32,210 --> 00:49:32,650
But...

1292
00:49:32,650 --> 00:49:35,830
It gives you like... you know...

1293
00:49:36,050 --> 00:49:38,330
A lot of like... NFTs...

1294
00:49:38,330 --> 00:49:39,430
Hahahaha...

1295
00:49:39,430 --> 00:49:41,510
And bots...

1296
00:49:41,510 --> 00:49:43,910
So... By sheer research...

1297
00:49:43,910 --> 00:49:46,170
And I don't know... Maybe... Wow...

1298
00:49:46,170 --> 00:49:48,530
Maybe some like... It came to me in a dream...

1299
00:49:48,530 --> 00:49:50,070
I realized that...

1300
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:51,950
I'm never using art...

1301
00:49:51,950 --> 00:49:54,150
For an art tag ever again...

1302
00:49:55,230 --> 00:49:55,830
Hahahaha...

1303
00:49:56,630 --> 00:49:58,370
So... So our...

1304
00:49:59,990 --> 00:50:00,290
Our...

1305
00:50:01,350 --> 00:50:01,950
Our...

1306
00:50:01,950 --> 00:50:03,370
Our art tag is...

1307
00:50:03,370 --> 00:50:04,790
Doki Gallery...

1308
00:50:05,410 --> 00:50:07,030
We're gonna have...

1309
00:50:07,030 --> 00:50:09,970
I guess like... Tags suggest... You know what...

1310
00:50:09,970 --> 00:50:11,470
We're just gonna do it to the point...

1311
00:50:11,470 --> 00:50:13,130
Because we're retiring this tag anyway...

1312
00:50:13,130 --> 00:50:15,570
But any... For any tag suggestions...

1313
00:50:15,810 --> 00:50:17,590
And names... Feel...

00:50:17,590 --> 00:50:20,050
Oh my gosh... Feel... I might make some funny faces...

00:50:20,070 --> 00:50:22,210
While I'm typing... Just so you guys know...

1316
00:50:22,210 --> 00:50:23,870
Um... Oh my god... That...

00:50:23,870 --> 00:50:26,110

00:50:47,820 --> 00:50:49,100
Alright...

1329
00:50:49,820 --> 00:50:50,540
Um...

1330
00:50:51,820 --> 00:50:53,860
You wanna suggest tags... It is...

1331
00:50:53,860 --> 00:50:55,680
Hashtag... Doki...

1332
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:58,000
Tags... Tag suggestions...

1333
00:50:58,440 --> 00:50:59,720
There we go...

1334
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:00,740
So...

1335
00:51:01,820 --> 00:51:03,680
Any... Like you know...

1336
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:05,640
Uh... Like...

1337
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:07,580
The usual tags...

1338
00:51:07,580 --> 00:51:10,040
I guess like... Live tag...

1339
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:12,180
Memes tag...

1340
00:51:12,460 --> 00:51:14,000
Um...

1341
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,960
I forgot...

1342
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:17,660
I'm sorry... It's... Please...

1343
00:51:17,660 --> 00:51:20,000
Give me a... It's been a month plus...

1344
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,660
It's actually... It's been...

1345
00:51:21,820 --> 00:51:23,300
So long...

1346
00:51:23,660 --> 00:51:23,920
Hahahaha...

1347
00:51:25,620 --> 00:51:26,140
Hahahaha...

1348
00:51:27,820 --> 00:51:29,780
It's... It's been so long...

1349
00:51:29,780 --> 00:51:31,480
I... I was like... Fuck...

1350
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:32,940
What do we use for tags again?

1351
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:35,620
I just remembered the live tag... The memes tag...

1352
00:51:35,620 --> 00:51:36,600
The... Oh!

1353
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:37,420
Shrine!

1354
00:51:37,740 --> 00:51:38,260
Yes!

1355
00:51:39,340 --> 00:51:41,380
We're bringing back the shrine...

1356
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:43,820
Oh... Doki Shrine...

1357
00:51:43,820 --> 00:51:45,520
I'm just gonna... It's to the point...

1358
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:47,700
I swear to god... If someone already has Doki Shrine...

1359
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:49,660
I... This is the worst part because...

1360
00:51:49,660 --> 00:51:51,440
It's like... Doki is like...

1361
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:53,780
It's like...

1362
00:51:53,780 --> 00:51:54,640
It's like a real word...

1363
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:57,740
It's like a real word...

1364
00:51:57,740 --> 00:51:59,140
I feel like someone already...

1365
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:01,580
Guys, don't use Doki Shrine...

1366
00:52:01,580 --> 00:52:03,740
Because I have a feeling that Doki Shrine...

1367
00:52:03,740 --> 00:52:05,340
Is an actual real tag...

1368
00:52:05,340 --> 00:52:07,800
Because it makes sense when you put it together...

1369
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:08,580
So...

1370
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:12,640
So...

1371
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:13,060
So...

1372
00:52:13,060 --> 00:52:14,960
Give a shrine tag somewhere...

1373
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:16,860
Um...

1374
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:19,300
Uh... Where was I?

1375
00:52:19,300 --> 00:52:20,220
Where was I?

1376
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:20,740
Where was I?

1377
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:21,240
Where was I?

1378
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:22,800
Uh...

1379
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:24,960
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba...

1380
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:25,560
Fuck.

1381
00:52:25,700 --> 00:52:25,940
Okay.

1382
00:52:26,740 --> 00:52:27,140
Uh...

1383
00:52:30,660 --> 00:52:33,240
My brain is like on cog wheels right now...

1384
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:35,080
Trying to get back into the groove of things...

1385
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:36,100
Because it's like...

1386
00:52:37,340 --> 00:52:39,100
I had... I had a system...

1387
00:52:39,100 --> 00:52:40,460
Of everything I... Oh wait, no.

1388
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:41,020
I already finished...

1389
00:52:41,020 --> 00:52:42,320
Everything I want to say... Right?

1390
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:43,120
I had...

1391
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:44,800
I... Literally...

1392
00:52:45,220 --> 00:52:47,760
The order of this... The chronological order of this...

1393
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:48,540
Was...

1394
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:49,680
Birthday.

1395
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:50,760
Doxing story.

1396
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:52,740
Doki Doge.

1397
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:54,600
Doki Amber Doge.

1398
00:52:55,060 --> 00:52:55,700
Tags.

1399
00:52:55,700 --> 00:52:56,260
Oh!

1400
00:52:56,380 --> 00:52:57,000
Merch!

1401
00:52:57,420 --> 00:52:58,060
Merch!

1402
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:03,340
I don't know if Mr. Man has like... finished setting... Okay!

1403
00:53:07,060 --> 00:53:09,340
To get started on your Doki Shrine.

1404
00:53:13,300 --> 00:53:14,580
We're relaunching!

1405
00:53:15,540 --> 00:53:16,640
Relaunching the original!

1406
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:17,060
The original!

1407
00:53:18,380 --> 00:53:20,640
The original Doki Merch!

1408
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:24,560
Please...

1409
00:53:25,260 --> 00:53:30,360
applaud Mr. Man because two hours before the stream...

1410
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:32,800
I was like, okay...

1411
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:36,780
Can you like, put these things up on the store?

1412
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:39,000
I'll give you the information and illustration.

1413
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:39,840
Just...

1414
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:41,080
put it all up there.

1415
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:41,860
I don't have time.

1416
00:53:47,660 --> 00:53:48,200
So...

1417
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:53,100
Let me check real quick if the store is up yet.

1418
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:56,300
Let's see... Oh!

1419
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:57,680
Please no!

1420
00:53:57,840 --> 00:53:58,200
Wait!

1421
00:53:59,220 --> 00:54:01,720
That was when I asked him...

1422
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:03,640
That's when he talked about like reading...

1423
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:06,100
Like getting Fat Mel directed at him.

1424
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:07,480
And he's like, I don't really want to read.

1425
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:08,680
I don't really...

1426
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:12,420
I don't want to read the freaky ones directed at me.

1427
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:13,340
Alright.

1428
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:14,140
Alright.

1429
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:15,640
Mr. Man, are you...

1430
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:17,640
Do you have the store link?

1431
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:18,980
If not, it's okay.

1432
00:54:19,060 --> 00:54:20,980
We can segue into something else.

1433
00:54:21,700 --> 00:54:22,180
Also...

1434
00:54:23,660 --> 00:54:24,140
Also...

1435
00:54:24,140 --> 00:54:26,020
Also, also, also, also, also...

1436
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:29,580
We will have a Lunar New Year stream!

1437
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:31,400
Because...

1438
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:33,660
As someone that, you know...

1439
00:54:33,660 --> 00:54:35,300
I celebrate Lunar New Year...

1440
00:54:35,300 --> 00:54:36,520
You know...

1441
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:38,600
Due to my culture...

1442
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:40,120
And...

1443
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:42,900
The holiday really does mean a lot to me.

1444
00:54:43,980 --> 00:54:45,460
It really does mean a lot to me.

1445
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:45,620
And...

1446
00:54:46,660 --> 00:54:47,750
It's the year of...

1447
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:49,040
You know...

1448
00:54:50,180 --> 00:54:51,300
Of new beginnings.

1449
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:52,740
So...

1450
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:55,320
I was going to save this on Lunar New Year.

1451
00:54:55,480 --> 00:54:56,380
But then I was just like...

1452
00:54:56,380 --> 00:54:58,780
I just want to spoil you guys a little bit.

1453
00:54:59,360 --> 00:54:59,860
So...

1454
00:54:59,860 --> 00:55:01,800
We will be having...

1455
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:04,120
Lunar New Year merch.

1456
00:55:04,940 --> 00:55:07,120
Which will come out on Lunar New Year.

1457
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:09,980
And...

1458
00:55:11,860 --> 00:55:12,360
And...

1459
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:14,140
And...

1460
00:55:14,140 --> 00:55:14,380
And...

1461
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:18,120
And...

1462
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:19,180
And...

1463
00:55:20,340 --> 00:55:21,920
This will be...

1464
00:55:22,820 --> 00:55:24,560
This will be the acrylic stand.

1465
00:55:25,660 --> 00:55:26,140
For...

1466
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:28,960
It's not finished yet.

1467
00:55:29,080 --> 00:55:29,820
It's not finished yet.

1468
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:30,800
It's still a draft.

1469
00:55:31,020 --> 00:55:31,620
It's still a draft.

1470
00:55:31,980 --> 00:55:35,740
But this is one of the Lunar New Year...

1471
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:38,200
Merch that I'm going to be selling.

1472
00:55:38,780 --> 00:55:39,260
And...

1473
00:55:39,260 --> 00:55:40,420
There is one more.

1474
00:55:40,660 --> 00:55:42,540
I am really, really, really excited about.

1475
00:55:42,700 --> 00:55:44,640
This one I am super happy about.

1476
00:55:44,740 --> 00:55:45,480
This is a little preview.

1477
00:55:45,860 --> 00:55:47,740
But I will have some...

1478
00:55:47,740 --> 00:55:48,700
RED POCKET EVOLOPES!

1479
00:55:49,780 --> 00:55:50,680
This is the preview!

1480
00:55:51,540 --> 00:55:52,440
Oh my god!

1481
00:55:52,840 --> 00:55:53,840
It's so cute.

1482
00:55:53,980 --> 00:55:56,840
Oh my gosh, when you see the full illustrations, it's like actually...

1483
00:55:58,540 --> 00:56:00,740
I'm... I cannot wait.

1484
00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:03,640
But we're gonna have red pocket envelopes too.

1485
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:06,080
This is obviously just a little preview.

1486
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:09,300
So when, you know, during Lunar New Year, when you know, whoa!

1487
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:10,320
You get to see the whole thing!

1488
00:56:10,740 --> 00:56:11,080
Whoa!

1489
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:16,160
But we're gonna have a three pack of some Lunar New Year envelopes.

1490
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:18,740
So you can use it to...

1491
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:24,040
Honestly, like honestly the best advice is to like never get married.

1492
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:27,820
So you can always receive red pocket envelopes.

1493
00:56:27,820 --> 00:56:32,540
So honestly just keep it for display because why the fuck would you want to give money to little kids?

1494
00:56:32,580 --> 00:56:32,960
Like...

1495
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:42,200
Because I was a little kid back then too.

1496
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:45,880
And I was a little kid back then too.

1497
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:49,520
And I abused the shit of the Lunar New Year system.

1498
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:55,040
As in I would go and hang out at my grandpa's place.

1499
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:57,780
Because he was the head of the family.

1500
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:01,240
And per tradition in Lunar New Year...

1501
00:57:02,820 --> 00:57:06,020
In Lunar New Year in China...

1502
00:57:07,180 --> 00:57:10,000
You have to go to the head of the family...

1503
00:57:11,060 --> 00:57:13,660
Like place and pay your respect.

1504
00:57:14,120 --> 00:57:15,720
So I would stay there overnight.

1505
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:22,180
I would stay there overnight.

1506
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:28,220
And because I was the first granddaughter...

1507
00:57:29,020 --> 00:57:31,640
That has the...

1508
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:33,380
That was my dad...

1509
00:57:33,380 --> 00:57:34,300
Like you know because you know...

1510
00:57:34,610 --> 00:57:35,820
My dad's a man.

1511
00:57:36,100 --> 00:57:36,440
So...

1512
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:43,900
So I have his last name Mr. Bird.

1513
00:57:49,020 --> 00:57:50,940
I would get more money.

1514
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:54,900
And that's how you cheese the system.

1515
00:57:55,500 --> 00:57:56,640
Make sure...

1516
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:57,300
Go to...

1517
00:57:57,300 --> 00:58:03,600
Make sure you go to the head of the family's place.

1518
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:04,980
Stay overnight.

1519
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:06,900
Never get married.

1520
00:58:07,580 --> 00:58:11,800
So you can get more money and never have to give away money.

1521
00:58:12,300 --> 00:58:12,920
There you go.

1522
00:58:13,060 --> 00:58:14,040
Just be born...

1523
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:15,140
And be born first.

1524
00:58:15,140 --> 00:58:15,860
And before...

1525
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:17,760
No, no, no, no.

1526
00:58:18,060 --> 00:58:19,340
Born first...

1527
00:58:19,340 --> 00:58:21,660
But for your dad's side.

1528
00:58:22,820 --> 00:58:24,780
And that's how you do it.

1529
00:58:24,900 --> 00:58:26,520
As long as...

1530
00:58:26,520 --> 00:58:28,420
As long as you do that...

1531
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:30,160
He has so much money.

1532
00:58:30,360 --> 00:58:32,440
He has so much money.

1533
00:58:35,020 --> 00:58:37,600
And go to every family dinner.

1534
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:40,880
Make sure you go to every single family dinner.

1535
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:42,160
Because...

1536
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:43,540
Sometimes they forgot.

1537
00:58:43,620 --> 00:58:44,360
They gave you this...

1538
00:58:44,360 --> 00:58:45,440
Gave you an envelope already.

1539
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:46,680
So...

1540
00:58:46,680 --> 00:58:49,420
Sometimes they forget to give you an envelope already.

1541
00:58:50,220 --> 00:58:50,700
So...

1542
00:58:51,300 --> 00:58:52,480
They give it to you again.

1543
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:54,660
Because they give so many envelopes.

1544
00:58:54,680 --> 00:58:55,560
They actually forget.

1545
00:58:56,580 --> 00:58:59,440
And then you have to make sure if you are the firstborn...

1546
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:00,880
Firstborn...

1547
00:59:01,660 --> 00:59:02,140
Grandchildren.

1548
00:59:02,520 --> 00:59:04,100
Make sure you tell them that.

1549
00:59:04,300 --> 00:59:05,080
Because they'll be like...

1550
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:05,740
Oh my god.

1551
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:07,180
That's Doki.

1552
00:59:08,020 --> 00:59:09,020
That's Mr. Bird.

1553
00:59:09,340 --> 00:59:11,780
That's Grandpa Bird's firstborn...

1554
00:59:12,260 --> 00:59:12,500
Grand...

1555
00:59:12,500 --> 00:59:13,780
Grand...

1556
00:59:13,780 --> 00:59:13,860
Grand...

1557
00:59:13,860 --> 00:59:14,140
Grand...

1558
00:59:14,140 --> 00:59:17,260
We gotta give her the bigger ones.

1559
00:59:24,040 --> 00:59:24,760
Genius.

1560
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:28,600
Doki, what if i'm not the first born?

1561
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:30,540
You will be soon.

1562
00:59:32,340 --> 00:59:33,580
Because they'll have to get married.

1563
00:59:34,700 --> 00:59:37,180
If you never get married...

1564
00:59:37,180 --> 00:59:38,440
One day...

1565
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:39,700
You will become...

1566
00:59:39,700 --> 00:59:41,720
Then you move up because...

1567
00:59:42,580 --> 00:59:48,580
If you never get married, the firstborn would have to get married so you become the firstborn.

1568
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:52,240
So their firstborn money will go to you.

1569
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:54,200
There you go.

1570
00:59:54,300 --> 00:59:55,860
And that's why you should never get married.

1571
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:58,140
If you celebrate Lunar New Year.

1572
00:59:58,240 --> 01:00:00,420
Because I don't know, some people might be like...

1573
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:03,140
Badoki, I don't celebrate Lunar New Year.

1574
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:06,080
I was gonna say...

1575
01:00:12,500 --> 01:00:13,640
That just sucks for you.

1576
01:00:13,780 --> 01:00:15,680
At that point, I don't know.

1577
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:19,220
Sorry, I don't know.

1578
01:00:19,480 --> 01:00:22,200
If you don't celebrate Lunar New Year at that point, I don't know.

1579
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:23,400
I don't know.

1580
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:25,480
That just...

1581
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:28,820
Well, just sucks to you, I guess.

1582
01:00:31,120 --> 01:00:33,260
Stop leaking the strategy.

1583
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:35,400
How many firstborns are out there?

1584
01:00:35,680 --> 01:00:40,300
This is only reserved for firstborn children only.

1585
01:00:41,100 --> 01:00:42,380
Who are not married.

1586
01:00:47,340 --> 01:00:47,860
I'm not married.

1587
01:00:47,860 --> 01:00:48,180
Alright, sorry.

1588
01:00:48,340 --> 01:00:49,160
That was a weird...

1589
01:00:49,160 --> 01:00:52,060
I haven't... guys, I haven't tangent in so long.

1590
01:00:52,300 --> 01:00:53,400
It's actually been...

1591
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:55,680
So long since I've tangent.

1592
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:57,340
It's so weird.

1593
01:00:57,420 --> 01:00:58,660
I haven't talked this long in a...

1594
01:00:59,420 --> 01:01:00,340
I... oh my gosh.

1595
01:01:00,420 --> 01:01:03,340
I haven't talked this long in a while.

1596
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:04,940
Oh yes.

1597
01:01:05,180 --> 01:01:06,260
What are you guys?

1598
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:08,860
You're... I don't really want you guys to be...

1599
01:01:08,860 --> 01:01:09,640
Bark Knights.

1600
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:11,120
Because...

1601
01:01:11,120 --> 01:01:11,820
Um...

1602
01:01:12,660 --> 01:01:14,080
To be honest...

1603
01:01:14,740 --> 01:01:15,340
Uh...

1604
01:01:15,340 --> 01:01:16,680
I feel like...

1605
01:01:16,680 --> 01:01:17,680
The Bark Knights...

1606
01:01:18,100 --> 01:01:19,500
Are the past...

1607
01:01:20,380 --> 01:01:20,980
Well...

1608
01:01:20,980 --> 01:01:22,000
Past past.

1609
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:22,740
Current.

1610
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:25,660
This is current now.

1611
01:01:26,120 --> 01:01:30,760
I know it's a bit mindfucky, but this...

1612
01:01:30,760 --> 01:01:32,280
Past current life.

1613
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:35,040
I guess that's how you explain it.

1614
01:01:35,360 --> 01:01:37,340
I feel like we've grown...

1615
01:01:37,340 --> 01:01:39,340
As a... as a person...

1616
01:01:39,340 --> 01:01:40,540
I'm a person now.

1617
01:01:40,680 --> 01:01:41,700
Actually you can say I'm a tomato.

1618
01:01:41,700 --> 01:01:41,820
I mean...

1619
01:01:41,820 --> 01:01:42,920
How we grown...

1620
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:45,100
The skin suit I'm a person now.

1621
01:01:46,280 --> 01:01:46,760
Well...

1622
01:01:46,760 --> 01:01:48,160
She takes off her hat.

1623
01:01:48,340 --> 01:01:50,140
She has some animal character.

1624
01:01:50,180 --> 01:01:50,980
We'll never know.

1625
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:52,800
We'll never know what's under this hat.

1626
01:01:53,260 --> 01:01:53,740
Uh...

1627
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:56,960
Um...

1628
01:01:57,740 --> 01:01:59,120
So I honestly...

1629
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:00,160
I don't know.

1630
01:02:00,760 --> 01:02:01,240
Um...

1631
01:02:01,240 --> 01:02:03,200
If you wanna like suggest...

1632
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:05,620
What you guys wanna be called...

1633
01:02:05,620 --> 01:02:06,240
Uh...

1634
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:07,540
And obviously we can just...

1635
01:02:07,540 --> 01:02:09,280
Decide and chat right now.

1636
01:02:09,360 --> 01:02:10,360
What you guys wanna be called.

1637
01:02:11,080 --> 01:02:11,600
Um...

1638
01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:13,780
Because I really...

1639
01:02:13,780 --> 01:02:14,160
I...

1640
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:15,200
I don't want you guys to be...

1641
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:15,660
Bark knights.

1642
01:02:16,680 --> 01:02:17,200
And...

1643
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:18,480
I don't know what you guys are.

1644
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:19,880
Is it a grid?

1645
01:02:19,980 --> 01:02:20,280
Oh yeah.

1646
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:21,060
What are you though?

1647
01:02:21,160 --> 01:02:21,480
Doki?

1648
01:02:22,140 --> 01:02:22,660
Well...

1649
01:02:22,660 --> 01:02:24,520
I don't know if you guys heard...

1650
01:02:24,520 --> 01:02:25,300
About evolution.

1651
01:02:25,960 --> 01:02:26,740
But like...

1652
01:02:26,740 --> 01:02:27,460
I'm a bird now.

1653
01:02:27,940 --> 01:02:28,460
Whoa...

1654
01:02:28,460 --> 01:02:29,500
So clever.

1655
01:02:29,940 --> 01:02:31,080
As if like...

1656
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:33,760
200,000 people didn't make the same joke...

1657
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:34,940
And I just stole it off chat.

1658
01:02:35,420 --> 01:02:35,940
Uh...

1659
01:02:35,940 --> 01:02:36,380
Because...

1660
01:02:36,380 --> 01:02:37,880
This thief never steals.

1661
01:02:39,260 --> 01:02:39,780
Um...

1662
01:02:39,780 --> 01:02:40,620
Free birds.

1663
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:42,440
Okay.

1664
01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:45,920
It just doesn't...

1665
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:47,300
Make sense.

1666
01:02:48,420 --> 01:02:49,480
Free birds.

1667
01:02:51,020 --> 01:02:53,180
I know you guys wanna be called...

1668
01:02:53,180 --> 01:02:54,060
But like...

1669
01:02:54,060 --> 01:02:54,400
It...

1670
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:56,820
If I use that in the sentence...

1671
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:00,400
That's the hardest part.

1672
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:01,280
Cause you're like...

1673
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:02,180
You want it to be...

1674
01:03:02,180 --> 01:03:02,780
Usable...

1675
01:03:03,460 --> 01:03:04,920
In the sentence as well.

1676
01:03:05,540 --> 01:03:06,380
So like...

1677
01:03:06,380 --> 01:03:08,060
Free birds isn't like...

1678
01:03:08,060 --> 01:03:09,680
The best way to say stuff.

1679
01:03:09,680 --> 01:03:10,020
So...

1680
01:03:15,600 --> 01:03:16,440
So like...

1681
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:18,240
I actually don't even know what you guys are.

1682
01:03:18,940 --> 01:03:21,260
There's so many like different...

1683
01:03:22,320 --> 01:03:23,440
designs too.

1684
01:03:23,580 --> 01:03:24,460
We'll figure that out.

1685
01:03:24,580 --> 01:03:25,240
We'll have a...

1686
01:03:25,240 --> 01:03:30,280
We'll have like a fan mascot stream in the future.

1687
01:03:30,760 --> 01:03:33,480
Whenever I figure out my schedule and everything.

1688
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:34,620
So don't worry guys.

1689
01:03:34,780 --> 01:03:36,120
We're gonna have a fan mascot.

1690
01:03:36,120 --> 01:03:42,460
A fan mascot stream where we draw the fan mascot in the next time.

1691
01:03:43,160 --> 01:03:45,580
But for now, I do really would like to...

1692
01:03:45,580 --> 01:03:47,400
I do really want to...

1693
01:03:47,960 --> 01:03:49,640
decide a name for all of you guys.

1694
01:03:50,180 --> 01:03:52,280
Because I don't know.

1695
01:03:52,360 --> 01:03:53,920
I don't fucking know what to call you.

1696
01:03:55,580 --> 01:03:57,720
We need some material to work with.

1697
01:03:57,820 --> 01:03:59,060
I'm sorry!

1698
01:04:00,280 --> 01:04:02,160
I found out two days ago.

1699
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:07,920
I can use that joke because I'm the depressed one here.

1700
01:04:08,140 --> 01:04:10,420
Like you just got...

1701
01:04:10,420 --> 01:04:12,400
I've been through so much at this point.

1702
01:04:12,440 --> 01:04:15,140
It's all about laughing it off at that point.

1703
01:04:15,380 --> 01:04:16,440
Because like...

1704
01:04:17,320 --> 01:04:21,720
If I stop and think and realize the reality of everything...

1705
01:04:21,720 --> 01:04:24,100
It will not be great for me.

1706
01:04:29,140 --> 01:04:29,720
So...

1707
01:04:29,720 --> 01:04:31,000
We have to...

1708
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,240
We just have to laugh it off sometimes.

1709
01:04:36,650 --> 01:04:39,500
The fu- I'm not calling you guys the fucking flock.

1710
01:04:40,130 --> 01:04:41,040
The raft.

1711
01:04:41,600 --> 01:04:44,060
Don't the fuck you guys have a basketball team?

1712
01:04:44,520 --> 01:04:45,140
No.

1713
01:04:46,100 --> 01:04:47,340
Absolutely not.

1714
01:04:49,750 --> 01:04:54,060
Look, I'm not gonna have fucking little tomatoes running around.

1715
01:04:55,020 --> 01:04:56,300
Not have that.

1716
01:04:56,920 --> 01:04:59,920
Tomatoes are for- Tiny tomatoes are for eating.

1717
01:05:00,160 --> 01:05:00,980
Big tomatoes are for eating.

1718
01:05:00,980 --> 01:05:02,280
Those tomatoes are for eating little tiny tomatoes.

1719
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:05,880
We're not...

1720
01:05:05,880 --> 01:05:07,880
I'm not calling you guys the nuggets.

1721
01:05:08,360 --> 01:05:08,920
What...

1722
01:05:08,920 --> 01:05:10,260
What are these names?

1723
01:05:11,120 --> 01:05:14,240
I came back for you guys to backseat me better.

1724
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:17,640
Yes!

1725
01:05:17,640 --> 01:05:19,880
It's supposed to be better backseaters.

1726
01:05:27,840 --> 01:05:28,480
Like...

1727
01:05:29,340 --> 01:05:30,720
That's a hockey team.

1728
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:35,880
Alright guys.

1729
01:05:35,880 --> 01:05:36,040
Guys!

1730
01:05:37,560 --> 01:05:38,040
Alright.

1731
01:05:39,020 --> 01:05:39,500
Apparently...

1732
01:05:40,360 --> 01:05:40,840
Apparently...

1733
01:05:41,340 --> 01:05:42,220
Right now...

1734
01:05:42,740 --> 01:05:46,600
Why must you hate all our i- Why must you hate all our ideas?

1735
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:48,160
Well...

1736
01:05:49,560 --> 01:05:50,920
I don't even know this...

1737
01:05:51,780 --> 01:05:52,260
But...

1738
01:05:58,520 --> 01:06:01,080
It's not that I hate all your ideas...

1739
01:06:01,080 --> 01:06:03,740
But your ideas are pretty fucking terrible.

1740
01:06:05,980 --> 01:06:06,460
Look!

1741
01:06:06,560 --> 01:06:07,180
I get it!

1742
01:06:07,180 --> 01:06:07,640
I get it!

1743
01:06:07,640 --> 01:06:08,200
I get it!

1744
01:06:08,320 --> 01:06:09,380
It's been a while!

1745
01:06:09,700 --> 01:06:10,660
It's been a while!

1746
01:06:11,060 --> 01:06:14,820
You guys gotta get all the terrible ideas out first before we hit the good ones.

1747
01:06:15,040 --> 01:06:16,040
So like, I get it.

1748
01:06:16,420 --> 01:06:18,960
You haven't let them out yet in a long time.

1749
01:06:19,100 --> 01:06:20,740
You know, you haven't said all these...

1750
01:06:20,740 --> 01:06:23,940
You've been keeping all these terrible ideas in you for so long.

1751
01:06:24,220 --> 01:06:25,880
So like, eventually...

1752
01:06:25,880 --> 01:06:27,880
You know, you get all that out of your system.

1753
01:06:28,180 --> 01:06:29,520
And fall into the routines.

1754
01:06:29,620 --> 01:06:31,320
Good ideas will start coming out.

1755
01:06:31,580 --> 01:06:32,720
The okey doke...

1756
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:33,220
Oh my...

1757
01:06:33,220 --> 01:06:33,920
Are we like what?

1758
01:06:33,940 --> 01:06:34,340
In kindergarten?

1759
01:06:35,840 --> 01:06:37,160
Hello little okey doke!

1760
01:06:37,180 --> 01:06:37,580
Little okey dokes!

1761
01:06:37,580 --> 01:06:39,960
Are you ready to learn the alphabets?

1762
01:06:40,100 --> 01:06:41,600
Little okey dokey!

1763
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:42,080
No...

1764
01:06:42,080 --> 01:06:42,560
No...

1765
01:06:48,180 --> 01:06:49,080
The...

1766
01:06:51,070 --> 01:06:52,420
The wingman...

1767
01:06:54,060 --> 01:06:55,600
Hello wingman...

1768
01:06:55,870 --> 01:06:56,320
No...

1769
01:06:56,320 --> 01:06:59,860
Absolutely not!

1770
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:02,560
Absolutely not!

1771
01:07:02,920 --> 01:07:04,900
We're not the wingman!

1772
01:07:05,020 --> 01:07:05,460
Okay!

1773
01:07:05,460 --> 01:07:07,180
Alright, I feel like...

1774
01:07:07,180 --> 01:07:08,900
I feel like all of us are...

1775
01:07:09,460 --> 01:07:10,420
Having trouble here.

1776
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:11,880
So...

1777
01:07:12,460 --> 01:07:13,620
Moving on...

1778
01:07:13,620 --> 01:07:14,460
Moving on...

1779
01:07:15,580 --> 01:07:17,400
Use the dokey tag suggestion.

1780
01:07:18,040 --> 01:07:20,400
Use the dokey tag suggestion...

1781
01:07:21,700 --> 01:07:22,380
To...

1782
01:07:22,380 --> 01:07:23,760
Figure out...

1783
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:24,340
You know...

1784
01:07:24,340 --> 01:07:25,700
You know, what...

1785
01:07:25,700 --> 01:07:26,460
What you...

1786
01:07:26,460 --> 01:07:27,260
What you wanna be called!

1787
01:07:27,640 --> 01:07:28,700
What you wanna be called.

1788
01:07:29,600 --> 01:07:30,280
Because...

1789
01:07:30,280 --> 01:07:31,560
At the moment...

1790
01:07:32,760 --> 01:07:34,240
I like how it's like...

1791
01:07:34,240 --> 01:07:35,420
I like how there's...

1792
01:07:35,420 --> 01:07:36,240
Literally two...

1793
01:07:36,240 --> 01:07:38,080
I think I didn't make a powerpoint slide.

1794
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:40,220
Because these are the two things I really...

1795
01:07:40,220 --> 01:07:40,600
Like...

1796
01:07:40,600 --> 01:07:41,880
Likes and dislikes!

1797
01:07:42,080 --> 01:07:42,800
I don't...

1798
01:07:42,800 --> 01:07:43,460
I don't...

1799
01:07:44,080 --> 01:07:44,340
You're...

1800
01:07:44,340 --> 01:07:45,240
At this point...

1801
01:07:45,240 --> 01:07:46,940
I feel like we all...

1802
01:07:46,940 --> 01:07:48,240
To be fair...

1803
01:07:48,800 --> 01:07:50,220
Who the fuck watches...

1804
01:07:50,220 --> 01:07:53,160
Goes back to watch just for the likes and dislikes.

1805
01:07:53,240 --> 01:07:53,580
Like...

1806
01:07:53,580 --> 01:07:54,160
I'm...

1807
01:07:54,160 --> 01:07:55,000
I'm gonna say it.

1808
01:07:55,200 --> 01:07:55,720
I'm...

1809
01:07:55,720 --> 01:07:56,600
I'm gonna say it.

1810
01:07:56,840 --> 01:07:57,360
Like...

1811
01:07:58,480 --> 01:08:00,240
Who the fuck actually...

1812
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:01,880
What the fuck?

1813
01:08:02,840 --> 01:08:03,800
Oh shit!

1814
01:08:03,800 --> 01:08:04,320
Oh wait!

1815
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:04,760
That's fine!

1816
01:08:04,820 --> 01:08:05,760
I'm not even monetized.

1817
01:08:10,580 --> 01:08:11,700
Oh shit!

1818
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:14,400
That scared the shit out of me.

1819
01:08:17,880 --> 01:08:19,360
Oh my god!

1820
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:23,240
Where the fuck is the ad?

1821
01:08:25,180 --> 01:08:26,140
There we go.

1822
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:31,200
I...

1823
01:08:31,700 --> 01:08:32,680
I honestly...

1824
01:08:32,680 --> 01:08:33,320
I'm just...

1825
01:08:33,320 --> 01:08:34,680
Even though I'm not monetized...

1826
01:08:35,260 --> 01:08:36,880
I really don't want this thing getting...

1827
01:08:37,420 --> 01:08:37,940
Like...

1828
01:08:37,940 --> 01:08:40,660
This song is blocked in these countries.

1829
01:08:41,060 --> 01:08:42,100
Because that would fucking suck.

1830
01:08:42,220 --> 01:08:44,060
That would actually fucking suck.

1831
01:08:45,260 --> 01:08:46,200
Where was I?

1832
01:08:47,300 --> 01:08:47,820
Wait...

1833
01:08:47,820 --> 01:08:49,960
What was I talking about before I got...

1834
01:08:51,360 --> 01:08:51,880
Before...

1835
01:08:51,880 --> 01:08:52,500
Fuck!

1836
01:08:52,520 --> 01:08:53,400
What was I talking about?

1837
01:08:54,500 --> 01:08:55,400
God damn it!

1838
01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:57,420
Now I have freebirds stuck in my head.

1839
01:08:59,480 --> 01:09:01,800
We're not gonna be called freebirds!

1840
01:09:01,800 --> 01:09:02,940
It doesn't...

1841
01:09:02,940 --> 01:09:04,080
I know you guys...

1842
01:09:04,080 --> 01:09:05,980
Holy shit, LordPancake!

1843
01:09:06,140 --> 01:09:07,240
I'm so sorry.

1844
01:09:07,380 --> 01:09:08,680
Like, if you all...

1845
01:09:08,680 --> 01:09:11,200
Thank you so much for the donation.

1846
01:09:11,360 --> 01:09:12,140
Thank you.

1847
01:09:12,280 --> 01:09:13,720
Okay, I'm gonna say it.

1848
01:09:13,880 --> 01:09:17,020
Like, I don't look back to a VTuber debut.

1849
01:09:17,480 --> 01:09:18,740
Honestly, it's not even a debut.

1850
01:09:18,820 --> 01:09:19,320
I'm just back.

1851
01:09:19,540 --> 01:09:20,800
Like, to be like...

1852
01:09:20,800 --> 01:09:21,320
Wait!

1853
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:24,320
I have my debut stream on.

1854
01:09:24,460 --> 01:09:24,980
So...

1855
01:09:24,980 --> 01:09:26,020
That's right!

1856
01:09:26,280 --> 01:09:28,160
I'm not making it because...

1857
01:09:28,160 --> 01:09:29,760
Why did I even put my birthday?

1858
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:31,460
You can literally look at the debut.

1859
01:09:31,460 --> 01:09:31,780
I'm not making it because...

1860
01:09:31,780 --> 01:09:35,340
Oh, I have my debut stream that's still on this channel from four years ago.

1861
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:36,940
It's still there!

1862
01:09:37,320 --> 01:09:37,920
Like...

1863
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:44,760
I can't believe I forgot I've debuted before.

1864
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:45,800
And...

1865
01:09:48,740 --> 01:09:49,940
Holy shit!

1866
01:09:50,100 --> 01:09:51,740
Guys, I've actually debuted before.

1867
01:09:51,980 --> 01:09:56,400
So, you can look at the debut pod for, like, likes and dislikes.

1868
01:09:56,660 --> 01:09:58,460
Why the fuck did I even put birthday?

1869
01:09:58,680 --> 01:09:59,720
Alright, anyway.

1870
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:01,400
But the tag's back there.

1871
01:10:01,480 --> 01:10:01,760
The...

1872
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:02,760
They're like, retired.

1873
01:10:04,540 --> 01:10:05,900
Because it's new me.

1874
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:07,920
New me, new life.

1875
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:10,540
I like how people are still like, What about Freebirds?

1876
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:11,420
We're not gonna be Freebirds.

1877
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:14,200
The reason why we're not gonna be Freebirds is that it doesn't...

1878
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:19,640
It doesn't like, roll off the tongue as good as you guys think it does.

1879
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:21,080
It doesn't...

1880
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:22,280
Also...

1881
01:10:23,160 --> 01:10:23,600
Also...

1882
01:10:25,160 --> 01:10:30,120
Like, how do you f- How the f- do you visualize that?

1883
01:10:30,240 --> 01:10:30,620
Like...

1884
01:10:31,300 --> 01:10:31,820
Like...

1885
01:10:32,460 --> 01:10:38,120
It's harder for all of us to like, think of like, what you all look like if you're called Freebirds.

1886
01:10:44,120 --> 01:10:45,800
So don't worry, we'll figure that out.

1887
01:10:45,940 --> 01:10:48,140
We'll figure that out soon.

1888
01:10:50,660 --> 01:10:51,180
But...

1889
01:10:51,180 --> 01:10:51,920
Oh my god.

1890
01:10:59,570 --> 01:11:00,890
It's actually... it's...

1891
01:11:03,450 --> 01:11:05,350
It's actually, it's just been wild.

1892
01:11:05,450 --> 01:11:06,850
I feel like I haven't...

1893
01:11:06,850 --> 01:11:08,510
I feel like I'm losing stamina.

1894
01:11:08,810 --> 01:11:11,890
Because like, I haven't talked...

1895
01:11:12,630 --> 01:11:13,630
This long.

1896
01:11:14,490 --> 01:11:16,130
In a very long time.

1897
01:11:17,810 --> 01:11:18,110
And...

1898
01:11:19,150 --> 01:11:20,690
I'm so... I'm just...

1899
01:11:20,690 --> 01:11:21,890
I'm not used to it.

1900
01:11:22,570 --> 01:11:24,170
But I also...

1901
01:11:24,950 --> 01:11:25,550
I...

1902
01:11:26,350 --> 01:11:28,190
I miss it so much.

1903
01:11:28,210 --> 01:11:28,990
I really do.

1904
01:11:29,170 --> 01:11:29,570
I...

1905
01:11:30,370 --> 01:11:32,450
I really... I really miss this.

1906
01:11:32,850 --> 01:11:33,570
A lot.

1907
01:11:33,690 --> 01:11:34,350
And...

1908
01:11:34,350 --> 01:11:35,870
I really just...

1909
01:11:35,870 --> 01:11:38,390
I miss just talking with all of you.

1910
01:11:39,630 --> 01:11:40,290
And...

1911
01:11:41,110 --> 01:11:42,350
And just...

1912
01:11:42,350 --> 01:11:43,510
I guess like...

1913
01:11:43,510 --> 01:11:44,650
Restarting.

1914
01:11:45,750 --> 01:11:46,080
And...

1915
01:11:46,790 --> 01:11:47,450
And...

1916
01:11:47,450 --> 01:11:48,410
Oh my god.

1917
01:11:49,560 --> 01:11:51,290
There's just so much potential.

1918
01:11:51,710 --> 01:11:52,370
And...

1919
01:11:52,370 --> 01:11:53,870
Let's try...

1920
01:11:55,050 --> 01:12:00,570
Let's try and aim for 500k subscribers by the end of this year.

1921
01:12:00,790 --> 01:12:01,370
Okay guys?

1922
01:12:01,370 --> 01:12:02,670
You guys think we can do it?

1923
01:12:03,190 --> 01:12:04,430
I think that's...

1924
01:12:04,430 --> 01:12:06,110
I think like goals wise...

1925
01:12:06,110 --> 01:12:07,170
I would love to hit...

1926
01:12:07,170 --> 01:12:08,290
Five...

1927
01:12:08,290 --> 01:12:08,950
Alright goals!

1928
01:12:09,270 --> 01:12:10,550
Oh my god goals!

1929
01:12:10,990 --> 01:12:11,910
Almost forgot.

1930
01:12:12,410 --> 01:12:13,410
I think...

1931
01:12:13,410 --> 01:12:17,830
It'll be 500k subscribers by the end of this year.

1932
01:12:18,150 --> 01:12:21,870
And then my dream goal would be a million subscribers.

1933
01:12:23,370 --> 01:12:24,010
And...

1934
01:12:26,670 --> 01:12:27,310
I...

1935
01:12:27,310 --> 01:12:28,730
I guess like...

1936
01:12:28,730 --> 01:12:29,650
The PC...

1937
01:12:29,650 --> 01:12:31,850
A PC sponsor.

1938
01:12:33,270 --> 01:12:33,790
And...

1939
01:12:33,790 --> 01:12:35,450
A gaming gear sponsor.

1940
01:12:35,590 --> 01:12:36,550
Oh my gosh.

1941
01:12:36,870 --> 01:12:38,870
I would love to have a gaming gear sponsor.

1942
01:12:39,370 --> 01:12:40,210
I want...

1943
01:12:40,210 --> 01:12:41,190
I want...

1944
01:12:41,190 --> 01:12:41,610
I want a...

1945
01:12:41,610 --> 01:12:43,330
You know like those like gamer mouse pads?

1946
01:12:43,690 --> 01:12:43,990
You know?

1947
01:12:44,230 --> 01:12:44,650
Like...

1948
01:12:44,650 --> 01:12:45,210
Cause okay.

1949
01:12:45,390 --> 01:12:46,810
I love when people are like...

1950
01:12:46,810 --> 01:12:48,370
Why the fuck do you have two mouse pads?

1951
01:12:49,610 --> 01:12:51,010
You don't fucking understand!

1952
01:12:51,650 --> 01:12:52,110
Alright.

1953
01:12:52,210 --> 01:12:53,950
For all you non-gamers out there.

1954
01:12:54,310 --> 01:12:56,170
You have a normal desk mat.

1955
01:12:56,690 --> 01:12:57,730
That's like cute.

1956
01:12:57,950 --> 01:12:58,810
Or I don't know.

1957
01:12:58,810 --> 01:12:59,270
Like...

1958
01:12:59,890 --> 01:13:02,230
Anime like JJK on there or some shit.

1959
01:13:02,310 --> 01:13:02,690
I don't...

1960
01:13:02,690 --> 01:13:03,350
I don't know.

1961
01:13:05,370 --> 01:13:06,970
Usually it's either...

1962
01:13:07,630 --> 01:13:08,670
Something fucking cute.

1963
01:13:08,830 --> 01:13:09,830
Or like...

1964
01:13:09,830 --> 01:13:11,150
The anime of the year.

1965
01:13:11,290 --> 01:13:11,970
Which would be...

1966
01:13:11,970 --> 01:13:13,610
I guess like JJK.

1967
01:13:13,830 --> 01:13:14,750
And then...

1968
01:13:14,750 --> 01:13:15,670
On top of it...

1969
01:13:15,670 --> 01:13:16,690
You have a...

1970
01:13:17,430 --> 01:13:17,950
Second...

1971
01:13:18,670 --> 01:13:20,190
Mouse pad on top of it.

1972
01:13:20,310 --> 01:13:21,810
And it's the gamer mouse pad.

1973
01:13:21,930 --> 01:13:22,490
So it's like...

1974
01:13:22,490 --> 01:13:23,670
I use the...

1975
01:13:23,670 --> 01:13:24,990
What the fuck do I use?

1976
01:13:26,370 --> 01:13:27,810
I think I use the Hien FX.

1977
01:13:27,810 --> 01:13:28,630
I can't read.

1978
01:13:28,730 --> 01:13:29,450
It's been used a while.

1979
01:13:29,670 --> 01:13:30,830
So I use the Hien FX.

1980
01:13:31,410 --> 01:13:33,270
But there's like Skypad and stuff like that.

1981
01:13:33,610 --> 01:13:35,890
Like if you want to use glass like mouse pad.

1982
01:13:36,030 --> 01:13:36,990
There's like Skypad.

1983
01:13:37,290 --> 01:13:40,210
And I would love to have a gaming gear.

1984
01:13:40,630 --> 01:13:41,750
I should write this down.

1985
01:13:41,890 --> 01:13:42,390
But like...

1986
01:13:42,390 --> 01:13:43,750
You guys can write it down for me.

1987
01:13:44,290 --> 01:13:44,390
I...

1988
01:13:51,650 --> 01:13:52,450
But honestly...

1989
01:13:52,450 --> 01:13:54,830
That would be a dream come true for me as well.

1990
01:13:56,190 --> 01:13:56,990
It's crazy.

1991
01:13:56,990 --> 01:13:57,890
I...

1992
01:13:59,730 --> 01:14:00,370
So...

1993
01:14:00,370 --> 01:14:02,090
So many people...

1994
01:14:02,090 --> 01:14:04,930
Reached out to me for...

1995
01:14:04,930 --> 01:14:05,790
To like...

1996
01:14:05,790 --> 01:14:06,230
For like...

1997
01:14:06,230 --> 01:14:07,650
Sponsors and like...

1998
01:14:07,650 --> 01:14:09,710
Deals and all that stuff.

1999
01:14:09,870 --> 01:14:11,950
And I'm not used to it.

2000
01:14:12,050 --> 01:14:12,810
At all.

2001
01:14:14,630 --> 01:14:15,470
You know?

2002
01:14:15,530 --> 01:14:17,350
I've always thought it wasn't marketable.

2003
01:14:22,270 --> 01:14:22,910
So...

2004
01:14:24,310 --> 01:14:24,950
I've...

2005
01:14:24,950 --> 01:14:26,890
I have a huge...

2006
01:14:26,890 --> 01:14:26,970
I can't...

2007
01:14:26,970 --> 01:14:29,610
I've always had a huge imposter syndrome.

2008
01:14:30,150 --> 01:14:31,850
And I've...

2009
01:14:31,850 --> 01:14:35,010
Oh my god, like...

2010
01:14:37,790 --> 01:14:42,110
The stuff that Mr. Man sent to me...

2011
01:14:42,110 --> 01:14:44,530
I was just...

2012
01:14:44,530 --> 01:14:46,190
I was like, what?

2013
01:14:46,550 --> 01:14:51,350
They were like, oh yeah, this, this, and then...

2014
01:14:51,350 --> 01:14:54,110
Do this, and...

2015
01:14:54,110 --> 01:14:55,610
I was like...

2016
01:14:56,970 --> 01:14:57,110
Huh?

2017
01:14:57,830 --> 01:14:58,590
What?

2018
01:15:01,290 --> 01:15:02,050
And...

2019
01:15:02,050 --> 01:15:04,490
I just never... I don't know.

2020
01:15:04,490 --> 01:15:05,590
It's just crazy.

2021
01:15:05,790 --> 01:15:06,790
It really...

2022
01:15:06,790 --> 01:15:09,050
It really...

2023
01:15:09,050 --> 01:15:10,430
Really is.

2024
01:15:10,710 --> 01:15:12,830
And... I'm getting emotional.

2025
01:15:13,050 --> 01:15:14,950
I told myself I shouldn't cry.

2026
01:15:15,250 --> 01:15:17,030
Because I've cried too much.

2027
01:15:17,410 --> 01:15:21,110
I really have cried way, way too fucking much.

2028
01:15:24,510 --> 01:15:26,410
And... it's just...

2029
01:15:26,970 --> 01:15:28,910
I was so surprised.

2030
01:15:29,010 --> 01:15:31,330
I never thought I'd...

2031
01:15:31,330 --> 01:15:33,890
You know, people would want me to advertise their stuff.

2032
01:15:34,190 --> 01:15:37,790
But I was just this anime girl that played video games.

2033
01:15:37,990 --> 01:15:40,410
And do stupid shit sometimes.

2034
01:15:41,310 --> 01:15:42,610
Okay, maybe not sometimes.

2035
01:15:43,930 --> 01:15:45,430
Maybe apparently not sometimes.

2036
01:15:52,520 --> 01:15:53,840
It's nice to laugh though.

2037
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:55,220
It's nice to laugh again.

2038
01:15:56,520 --> 01:15:57,080
Um...

2039
01:15:57,080 --> 01:15:58,180
It really is.

2040
01:15:58,340 --> 01:15:58,900
Um...

2041
01:15:58,920 --> 01:16:00,160
I don't think I've laughed...

2042
01:16:00,160 --> 01:16:02,680
I haven't laughed this much in a while now.

2043
01:16:03,180 --> 01:16:03,660
And...

2044
01:16:04,440 --> 01:16:05,640
It's nice to...

2045
01:16:06,320 --> 01:16:07,220
Be happy.

2046
01:16:07,800 --> 01:16:08,900
For this moment.

2047
01:16:09,280 --> 01:16:10,640
And... I wanna say thank you.

2048
01:16:10,720 --> 01:16:11,420
Thank you everybody.

2049
01:16:12,440 --> 01:16:12,920
Um...

2050
01:16:12,920 --> 01:16:15,760
I like how I say everybody because you guys have no name yet.

2051
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:16,100
But...

2052
01:16:22,340 --> 01:16:23,300
Thank you.

2053
01:16:23,320 --> 01:16:24,000
Thank you everyone.

2054
01:16:24,260 --> 01:16:25,780
It really... It really is.

2055
01:16:27,020 --> 01:16:27,500
Um...

2056
01:16:29,140 --> 01:16:29,620
Uh...

2057
01:16:30,440 --> 01:16:31,680
Just... Thank you for...

2058
01:16:31,680 --> 01:16:32,900
Making me laugh.

2059
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:33,460
Again.

2060
01:16:33,500 --> 01:16:33,960
And...

2061
01:16:33,960 --> 01:16:36,200
I hope I can make you guys laugh again as well.

2062
01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:38,180
I miss laughing with all of you.

2063
01:16:38,300 --> 01:16:38,780
And...

2064
01:16:38,780 --> 01:16:39,620
Oh my gosh.

2065
01:16:41,660 --> 01:16:43,400
You know what we can finally do?

2066
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,400
A members Minecraft server.

2067
01:16:48,180 --> 01:16:50,080
But I can't stream it in members.

2068
01:16:53,800 --> 01:16:55,680
I can finally...

2069
01:16:55,680 --> 01:16:57,480
I can finally do it!

2070
01:16:57,480 --> 01:16:59,420
I advise...

2071
01:17:01,260 --> 01:17:02,340
Minecraft server!

2072
01:17:03,400 --> 01:17:05,640
But I can't stream it in members though.

2073
01:17:05,860 --> 01:17:07,260
But I can't stream it in members though.

2074
01:17:07,260 --> 01:17:07,760
I guess they're still.

2075
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:09,980
Even though, even though I'm like...

2076
01:17:09,980 --> 01:17:13,320
Well, still can't do everything...

2077
01:17:14,640 --> 01:17:17,520
And... Garfield Cart.

2078
01:17:18,460 --> 01:17:21,300
They can't say no if I never ask.

2079
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:48,780
A little pause... and we are back.

2080
01:17:56,960 --> 01:17:58,580
Oh my god!

2081
01:18:00,580 --> 01:18:02,180
Oh my god!

2082
01:18:03,680 --> 01:18:04,840
Oh my god!

2083
01:18:04,980 --> 01:18:05,840
The best part.

2084
01:18:06,980 --> 01:18:07,840
Freddy Fish!

2085
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:10,080
Can't say no!

2086
01:18:10,600 --> 01:18:13,860
Can't say no!

2087
01:18:14,020 --> 01:18:15,560
Creative Commons!

2088
01:18:16,240 --> 01:18:17,380
Creative Commons!

2089
01:18:17,380 --> 01:18:19,800
I was gonna say America, but I'm like...

2090
01:18:19,800 --> 01:18:22,440
I told you the most American Canadian out there.

2091
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:24,340
Transformative!

2092
01:18:25,020 --> 01:18:26,460
This is transformative work.

2093
01:18:31,160 --> 01:18:32,740
Alright, sorry.

2094
01:18:32,840 --> 01:18:34,380
The first joke was like Oh my, let me ask for...

2095
01:18:34,380 --> 01:18:35,880
Oh, we don't have to anymore.

2096
01:18:36,060 --> 01:18:36,900
Oh my god!

2097
01:18:38,680 --> 01:18:39,180
Well...

2098
01:18:40,500 --> 01:18:41,340
I'm an indie!

2099
01:18:44,900 --> 01:18:49,320
I have transformative work!

2100
01:18:52,860 --> 01:18:54,960
Alright, anyway, for those who are wondering...

2101
01:18:56,480 --> 01:18:56,920
Platforms...

2102
01:18:56,920 --> 01:18:57,860
Oh my god!

2103
01:18:58,280 --> 01:18:59,140
Ichigo Games!

2104
01:18:59,760 --> 01:19:01,340
And like, you know like...

2105
01:19:01,340 --> 01:19:05,520
I really always wanted to just find random games on Steam and just be like...

2106
01:19:07,060 --> 01:19:07,500
Anyway...

2107
01:19:07,960 --> 01:19:08,840
What was I gonna say?

2108
01:19:09,180 --> 01:19:09,620
Fuck!

2109
01:19:09,780 --> 01:19:09,980
Okay.

2110
01:19:11,700 --> 01:19:12,780
Shit, okay, wait, wait.

2111
01:19:12,900 --> 01:19:13,400
I had something.

2112
01:19:13,980 --> 01:19:15,480
I had something right there.

2113
01:19:15,780 --> 01:19:16,680
God damn it, never mind.

2114
01:19:16,740 --> 01:19:17,060
I forgot.

2115
01:19:17,440 --> 01:19:19,100
I actually...

2116
01:19:19,100 --> 01:19:20,740
I actually forgot what I was gonna say.

2117
01:19:21,740 --> 01:19:22,640
Okay, but yes.

2118
01:19:22,700 --> 01:19:24,600
One of my first streams I really wanted to do was...

2119
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:26,620
Did you guys know there's private Neopets server?

2120
01:19:27,420 --> 01:19:28,080
Oh my god!

2121
01:19:28,400 --> 01:19:29,500
I was talking to Gumi.

2122
01:19:30,060 --> 01:19:30,860
You know...

2123
01:19:30,860 --> 01:19:31,480
Gumi.

2124
01:19:32,160 --> 01:19:35,100
One of my best friends for like seven fucking plus years.

2125
01:19:35,400 --> 01:19:36,260
I was talking to Gumi.

2126
01:19:36,740 --> 01:19:38,020
And like, she's like...

2127
01:19:38,020 --> 01:19:40,740
Bitch, why the fuck are you talking about Neopets?

2128
01:19:40,860 --> 01:19:41,880
And I was just like...

2129
01:19:41,880 --> 01:19:44,000
That's gonna be my first gaming stream.

2130
01:19:44,400 --> 01:19:45,600
And then she's like...

2131
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:46,420
Oh my god.

2132
01:19:46,900 --> 01:19:50,100
Check out my private server Neopets account.

2133
01:19:50,840 --> 01:19:52,960
And that blew my fucking mind.

2134
01:19:53,260 --> 01:19:53,400
And that blew my fucking mind.

2135
01:19:53,400 --> 01:19:56,880
There's private server Neopets account?

2136
01:19:57,200 --> 01:19:57,460
There's private server Neopets account?

2137
01:19:57,660 --> 01:19:58,300
Like...

2138
01:19:58,300 --> 01:19:59,480
And she was like...

2139
01:19:59,480 --> 01:20:03,060
Yeah, inflation fucking sucks on the public servers.

2140
01:20:03,500 --> 01:20:04,340
I was like...

2141
01:20:04,340 --> 01:20:04,840
What?

2142
01:20:05,280 --> 01:20:09,600
It got so bad...

2143
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:11,940
That people had to make private servers...

2144
01:20:11,940 --> 01:20:13,780
Because the inflation fucking sucks.

2145
01:20:14,060 --> 01:20:15,580
Because the inflation fucking sucks.

2146
01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:16,180
And I was like...

2147
01:20:16,180 --> 01:20:16,960
Excuse me?

2148
01:20:17,760 --> 01:20:18,860
But I can finally do it.

2149
01:20:19,560 --> 01:20:21,420
I can finally stream Neopets.

2150
01:20:21,540 --> 01:20:22,300
Oh my god.

2151
01:20:22,440 --> 01:20:24,900
They brought back unconverted pets!

2152
01:20:25,460 --> 01:20:26,440
Do you guys know that?

2153
01:20:26,580 --> 01:20:27,420
Fun fact!

2154
01:20:29,120 --> 01:20:31,800
The unconverted pets are on the black market.

2155
01:20:31,840 --> 01:20:34,040
Where you actually have to pay real money.

2156
01:20:34,160 --> 01:20:35,420
Like thousands of dollars.

2157
01:20:35,460 --> 01:20:36,900
To own an unconverted pet.

2158
01:20:37,180 --> 01:20:38,980
And now the market fucking crashed.

2159
01:20:39,160 --> 01:20:40,720
Because now they're introducing it back.

2160
01:20:41,500 --> 01:20:43,660
Because the creators of...

2161
01:20:43,660 --> 01:20:44,260
Alright, okay.

2162
01:20:44,320 --> 01:20:45,200
I can say this now.

2163
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:47,860
Because I don't have to tiptoe to lie.

2164
01:20:48,040 --> 01:20:49,080
But if you guys didn't know...

2165
01:20:49,080 --> 01:20:50,740
Neopets used to be owned by Scientology.

2166
01:20:55,220 --> 01:20:56,740
I can say that now.

2167
01:20:57,020 --> 01:20:57,460
Okay.

2168
01:20:59,680 --> 01:21:01,600
But they sold it.

2169
01:21:03,420 --> 01:21:04,620
They sold it.

2170
01:21:05,120 --> 01:21:07,220
And then they tried to be an NFT game.

2171
01:21:07,820 --> 01:21:10,100
And then they sold it to someone else.

2172
01:21:12,740 --> 01:21:13,620
And now...

2173
01:21:15,620 --> 01:21:16,260
Apparently...

2174
01:21:17,340 --> 01:21:19,760
The CEO of Neopets now...

2175
01:21:19,760 --> 01:21:21,660
Is actually like...

2176
01:21:23,380 --> 01:21:26,020
Some nostalgic old Neopets player.

2177
01:21:27,360 --> 01:21:30,100
He's like some fucking guy that grew up on Neopets.

2178
01:21:30,140 --> 01:21:31,800
Who's like some tech mongol now.

2179
01:21:32,260 --> 01:21:34,780
And he bought back Neopets.

2180
01:21:34,820 --> 01:21:36,800
And he's like, bring back unconverted pets!

2181
01:21:37,040 --> 01:21:38,900
Which I think it's because...

2182
01:21:38,900 --> 01:21:40,600
You know, he's like...

2183
01:21:40,600 --> 01:21:42,040
I have so much money now.

2184
01:21:42,040 --> 01:21:43,360
I don't wanna...

2185
01:21:44,640 --> 01:21:46,060
You know when you have...

2186
01:21:46,060 --> 01:21:47,240
Like a lot of money.

2187
01:21:47,540 --> 01:21:49,260
And then you're just like...

2188
01:21:49,820 --> 01:21:52,360
Give me back what the original version was.

2189
01:21:52,420 --> 01:21:54,180
So I can live my childhood now.

2190
01:21:54,360 --> 01:21:55,360
That type of deal.

2191
01:21:55,620 --> 01:21:56,720
You have so much money.

2192
01:21:56,820 --> 01:22:00,020
You buy back something and just revert it back to what it was.

2193
01:22:00,200 --> 01:22:01,900
Because that's where you had found happiness.

2194
01:22:02,340 --> 01:22:03,900
So like that's what he did.

2195
01:22:04,160 --> 01:22:05,700
And now...

2196
01:22:06,340 --> 01:22:08,300
The unconverted pets are back now.

2197
01:22:08,900 --> 01:22:09,400
So...

2198
01:22:10,340 --> 01:22:11,320
So like...

2199
01:22:12,040 --> 01:22:13,220
He brought back like...

2200
01:22:13,880 --> 01:22:15,300
Nostalgia just for himself.

2201
01:22:18,860 --> 01:22:19,980
Alright so like...

2202
01:22:19,980 --> 01:22:21,940
What I wanna do on Neopets...

2203
01:22:21,940 --> 01:22:23,400
Is I wanna enter the beauty contest.

2204
01:22:23,820 --> 01:22:26,080
Because I wanna fucking actually win...

2205
01:22:26,080 --> 01:22:28,180
First place in a beauty contest.

2206
01:22:28,760 --> 01:22:30,440
With the least amount of effort.

2207
01:22:30,720 --> 01:22:32,140
Because the beauty contest...

2208
01:22:32,140 --> 01:22:34,420
In Neopets taught me the hard thing.

2209
01:22:34,640 --> 01:22:35,660
Like taught me...

2210
01:22:35,660 --> 01:22:36,740
Fucking harsh reality.

2211
01:22:37,220 --> 01:22:39,300
Where it's not about how good you are at art.

2212
01:22:39,300 --> 01:22:42,200
It's basically a fucking popularity contest.

2213
01:22:42,520 --> 01:22:43,540
And who the fuck...

2214
01:22:43,540 --> 01:22:44,640
Advertises...

2215
01:22:44,640 --> 01:22:47,460
And who advertises on the beauty contest forums...

2216
01:22:47,840 --> 01:22:48,580
The most.

2217
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:49,420
And all that.

2218
01:22:49,500 --> 01:22:51,820
I'll vote for you shit if you vote for me.

2219
01:22:52,160 --> 01:22:52,760
Now!

2220
01:22:53,660 --> 01:22:54,260
Now!

2221
01:22:55,340 --> 01:22:56,640
I'm a streamer.

2222
01:22:56,880 --> 01:22:58,380
So I can abu...

2223
01:23:03,560 --> 01:23:04,160
Now!

2224
01:23:06,580 --> 01:23:07,540
I can...

2225
01:23:07,540 --> 01:23:09,200
I can make you...

2226
01:23:09,200 --> 01:23:10,700
Vote for me.

2227
01:23:11,340 --> 01:23:13,480
I don't fucking work for that anymore.

2228
01:23:17,560 --> 01:23:18,260
So...

2229
01:23:19,290 --> 01:23:19,640
ROBLOX!

2230
01:23:19,720 --> 01:23:20,440
Someone said it!

2231
01:23:20,740 --> 01:23:23,240
I can finally do Warrior Cats Roleplay.

2232
01:23:26,260 --> 01:23:26,960
No!

2233
01:23:27,160 --> 01:23:28,620
You don't understand!

2234
01:23:31,020 --> 01:23:33,180
Warrior Cats Roleplay...

2235
01:23:33,180 --> 01:23:35,460
Is just something I wanted in this stream.

2236
01:23:35,720 --> 01:23:37,020
For fucking ever.

2237
01:23:37,560 --> 01:23:38,080
No!

2238
01:23:38,180 --> 01:23:38,800
Okay.

2239
01:23:39,100 --> 01:23:39,740
Okay.

2240
01:23:39,760 --> 01:23:40,860
I know like... okay.

2241
01:23:41,340 --> 01:23:42,760
You never grew up with Warrior Cats.

2242
01:23:43,240 --> 01:23:44,580
Allright, now you read...

2243
01:23:44,580 --> 01:23:44,980
Okay.

2244
01:23:45,100 --> 01:23:46,060
When you get older...

2245
01:23:46,060 --> 01:23:47,420
You realize that this...

2246
01:23:47,420 --> 01:23:48,760
The books were pretty fucked up.

2247
01:23:49,060 --> 01:23:51,380
Because it was written by three different women.

2248
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:52,360
I think I said girls.

2249
01:23:52,780 --> 01:23:54,800
It was written by three different women.

2250
01:23:55,180 --> 01:23:57,460
And there were so many fucking cats...

2251
01:23:57,460 --> 01:24:00,020
That they didn't even know what the fuck was going on anymore.

2252
01:24:00,620 --> 01:24:01,100
Because...

2253
01:24:03,460 --> 01:24:05,760
One book was written by three different women.

2254
01:24:06,040 --> 01:24:08,920
That it was so hard to remember what cat was what.

2255
01:24:09,420 --> 01:24:09,900
Because...

2256
01:24:09,900 --> 01:24:12,560
I felt like they're always making babies.

2257
01:24:12,800 --> 01:24:15,620
So like there's always new fucking cats.

2258
01:24:15,920 --> 01:24:20,780
So there's like a whole fucking Wikipedia of trying to figure out which cat is what.

2259
01:24:21,240 --> 01:24:23,500
Because there's so many.

2260
01:24:23,580 --> 01:24:25,540
There's like Ravenpaw 1 and Ravenpaw 2.

2261
01:24:25,880 --> 01:24:31,000
Ravenpaw 1 from FireClan and then Ravenpaw fucking 500 and ShadowClan and shit like that.

2262
01:24:31,140 --> 01:24:31,900
And you don't care!

2263
01:24:32,120 --> 01:24:36,160
Because all you care about is like three cats or some shit.

2264
01:24:36,180 --> 01:24:37,640
Like Firestar fucking something.

2265
01:24:37,640 --> 01:24:39,020
Anyway, sorry I...

2266
01:24:39,780 --> 01:24:40,560
Sorry I...

2267
01:24:40,560 --> 01:24:42,960
I got way too into it.

2268
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:44,560
Yeah, Erenhunter is not one person.

2269
01:24:44,700 --> 01:24:45,240
It's three!

2270
01:24:45,860 --> 01:24:46,720
It's three!

2271
01:24:46,820 --> 01:24:47,940
That blew my fucking mind.

2272
01:24:48,300 --> 01:24:50,640
And they always forget what cat was what.

2273
01:24:50,920 --> 01:24:52,540
Like if you... it's like a thing.

2274
01:24:52,700 --> 01:24:56,000
They're like who the fuck is like Shadowpelt or whatever.

2275
01:24:56,480 --> 01:24:59,020
Like was he the one that like... I don't know.

2276
01:24:59,320 --> 01:25:01,100
Was he the one that fucked that cat?

2277
01:25:01,400 --> 01:25:02,420
Oh, we don't know.

2278
01:25:02,600 --> 01:25:04,100
Oh, he has two dads now.

2279
01:25:09,140 --> 01:25:09,980
Sorry, sorry.

2280
01:25:10,160 --> 01:25:10,600
I'm sorry.

2281
01:25:10,740 --> 01:25:11,120
I'm gonna...

2282
01:25:12,460 --> 01:25:13,040
I'm sorry.

2283
01:25:13,200 --> 01:25:15,060
I... I have a tangent and so...

2284
01:25:15,060 --> 01:25:17,960
I... I watched so many shorts.

2285
01:25:18,360 --> 01:25:20,940
I watched so many YouTube shorts.

2286
01:25:21,860 --> 01:25:25,080
I've gained so many knowledge on YouTube shorts.

2287
01:25:25,360 --> 01:25:29,060
That I... like while watching YouTube shorts, like fun fact...

2288
01:25:29,060 --> 01:25:31,760
Like there's like, you know, some YouTube shorts have like fun facts and shit like that.

2289
01:25:31,960 --> 01:25:33,900
I've like liked so many shorts.

2290
01:25:34,100 --> 01:25:35,660
So like I was like, whatever.

2291
01:25:36,040 --> 01:25:37,600
If I could ever stream...

2292
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:38,180
If I could ever stream again...

2293
01:25:39,440 --> 01:25:42,220
I need to... I need to tell them...

2294
01:25:42,980 --> 01:25:44,620
The things I learned.

2295
01:25:45,300 --> 01:25:48,620
All the things I learned on the fucking internet.

2296
01:25:49,120 --> 01:25:51,460
I need to... I need to tell somebody.

2297
01:25:52,180 --> 01:25:54,420
And there's so many... much... I...

2298
01:25:54,420 --> 01:26:01,000
I swear I like wasted like 3-4 hours of my life just in my bed just watching YouTube shorts.

2299
01:26:01,600 --> 01:26:03,580
Because life was meaningless back then.

2300
01:26:05,300 --> 01:26:06,600
Doki, why are you laughing?

2301
01:26:06,600 --> 01:26:08,580
That sounded so fucking depressing.

2302
01:26:10,700 --> 01:26:12,740
Because if you don't laugh...

2303
01:26:13,420 --> 01:26:14,700
It gets too real.

2304
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:25,300
Oh my god.

2305
01:26:25,640 --> 01:26:26,120
Okay.

2306
01:26:28,700 --> 01:26:30,180
Fuck, okay.

2307
01:26:30,560 --> 01:26:31,660
Oh my god.

2308
01:26:32,620 --> 01:26:33,300
Alright.

2309
01:26:34,360 --> 01:26:35,120
Give me a sec.

2310
01:26:35,200 --> 01:26:35,360
Wait.

2311
01:26:36,600 --> 01:26:37,260
Is the store ready?

2312
01:26:38,440 --> 01:26:39,160
Mr. Man?

2313
01:26:40,300 --> 01:26:42,300
Is the... Is the store ready?

2314
01:26:42,880 --> 01:26:45,260
If the store is ready, just send me the link, Mr. Man.

2315
01:26:46,500 --> 01:26:49,540
I don't even know if my manager is even watching me, to be honest.

2316
01:26:53,180 --> 01:26:59,160
Oh my god.

2317
01:27:00,240 --> 01:27:01,820
First day on the job!

2318
01:27:02,020 --> 01:27:03,860
Well, not... It wasn't his first day on the job.

2319
01:27:04,440 --> 01:27:04,840
But...

2320
01:27:07,800 --> 01:27:10,620
Guys, I have to message Mr. Man right now.

2321
01:27:13,080 --> 01:27:13,540
Alright.

2322
01:27:13,760 --> 01:27:15,580
Is the store ready?

2323
01:27:16,680 --> 01:27:17,140
Whoop!

2324
01:27:17,140 --> 01:27:17,800
There I go.

2325
01:27:18,100 --> 01:27:21,040
It's the shift key for those who are wondering why I keep doing that.

2326
01:27:22,700 --> 01:27:25,260
Why the fuck do I keep moving like this?

2327
01:27:26,240 --> 01:27:26,700
Alright.

2328
01:27:28,900 --> 01:27:29,360
Boop.

2329
01:27:29,420 --> 01:27:30,040
There we go.

2330
01:27:30,120 --> 01:27:30,540
Wait, what?

2331
01:27:30,720 --> 01:27:30,880
No.

2332
01:27:31,060 --> 01:27:32,160
No, that's not how I...

2333
01:27:32,160 --> 01:27:32,960
Oh my gosh.

2334
01:27:33,540 --> 01:27:34,000
Boop.

2335
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:35,060
There we go.

2336
01:27:35,740 --> 01:27:36,720
There we go.

2337
01:27:36,840 --> 01:27:37,100
Sorry.

2338
01:27:37,220 --> 01:27:37,740
So, wait.

2339
01:27:38,180 --> 01:27:39,200
I'm not even aligned.

2340
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:40,000
Fuck.

2341
01:27:40,060 --> 01:27:40,320
Okay.

2342
01:27:40,820 --> 01:27:41,340
Boop.

2343
01:27:46,920 --> 01:27:48,560
I am such a mess.

2344
01:27:49,220 --> 01:27:50,240
I am...

2345
01:27:50,240 --> 01:27:52,560
I am such a fucking mess.

2346
01:27:55,060 --> 01:27:56,880
But I'm your mess.

2347
01:27:57,080 --> 01:27:59,500
What does this say about you guys for watching this?

2348
01:28:05,850 --> 01:28:07,890
Just feels so good to stream again.

2349
01:28:08,670 --> 01:28:09,130
I...

2350
01:28:10,150 --> 01:28:11,270
Oh my god.

2351
01:28:11,330 --> 01:28:12,270
It really...

2352
01:28:12,270 --> 01:28:13,150
Really.

2353
01:28:13,230 --> 01:28:15,130
It feels so good to stream again.

2354
01:28:15,470 --> 01:28:15,930
I...

2355
01:28:17,330 --> 01:28:18,570
I really miss this.

2356
01:28:18,830 --> 01:28:23,530
I really...

2357
01:28:23,530 --> 01:28:24,990
I really miss this.

2358
01:28:25,150 --> 01:28:27,690
Okay, because I know Mr. Man isn't watching me.

2359
01:28:27,990 --> 01:28:30,390
He was like, did you look at the preview of the store?

2360
01:28:30,590 --> 01:28:31,550
And I said, yes.

2361
01:28:31,870 --> 01:28:33,110
But I actually didn't.

2362
01:28:33,110 --> 01:28:33,690
But it's okay.

2363
01:28:33,730 --> 01:28:35,550
He doesn't know, because he's not even watching me.

2364
01:28:35,630 --> 01:28:35,830
He's just like, okay, I'm gonna watch this.

2365
01:28:35,830 --> 01:28:36,530
So...

2366
01:28:40,830 --> 01:28:43,470
My first test...

2367
01:28:43,470 --> 01:28:47,590
Does my manager even watch my first fucking stream?

2368
01:28:54,970 --> 01:28:56,790
That's my very first test.

2369
01:28:57,110 --> 01:28:58,490
He doesn't know.

2370
01:29:00,270 --> 01:29:02,510
I don't... I think he's...

2371
01:29:06,010 --> 01:29:07,130
I don't... Wait.

2372
01:29:07,390 --> 01:29:07,870
Okay, wait.

2373
01:29:07,910 --> 01:29:08,410
He's typing.

2374
01:29:09,210 --> 01:29:12,510
He's the first one in the wild.

2375
01:29:14,490 --> 01:29:18,170
Mr. Man, are you even watching my very first stream?

2376
01:29:18,410 --> 01:29:22,470
Where I literally said, I didn't even check the preview.

2377
01:29:22,990 --> 01:29:25,250
And I said yes anyway.

2378
01:29:28,270 --> 01:29:28,750
Wait.

2379
01:29:29,010 --> 01:29:29,430
No.

2380
01:29:30,050 --> 01:29:30,890
No, wait, wait, wait.

2381
01:29:30,950 --> 01:29:31,190
Okay.

2382
01:29:32,250 --> 01:29:34,010
Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait a minute.

2383
01:29:34,090 --> 01:29:34,610
No, he's not...

2384
01:29:34,610 --> 01:29:35,770
By the way, I don't think he's watching.

2385
01:29:35,770 --> 01:29:38,350
Because I fucking... I can say whatever the fuck I want to this guy.

2386
01:29:38,470 --> 01:29:39,490
And he doesn't know.

2387
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:44,560
There we go.

2388
01:29:45,160 --> 01:29:45,540
Alright.

2389
01:29:46,740 --> 01:29:47,920
Because he was like...

2390
01:29:48,760 --> 01:29:50,380
Do you want the store to be in...

2391
01:29:52,060 --> 01:29:52,440
Canadian...

2392
01:29:54,560 --> 01:29:55,700
Canadian... Canadian dollars?

2393
01:29:56,200 --> 01:29:56,840
And I was like...

2394
01:29:56,840 --> 01:29:57,780
Fuck no.

2395
01:29:57,840 --> 01:29:58,840
The Canadian dollars suck.

2396
01:30:05,960 --> 01:30:07,120
What the fuck?

2397
01:30:07,120 --> 01:30:07,500
What the fuck?

2398
01:30:07,500 --> 01:30:08,480
Why would it be Canadian dollars?

2399
01:30:09,100 --> 01:30:10,580
Canadians relate though.

2400
01:30:10,840 --> 01:30:11,680
Canadians relate.

2401
01:30:11,880 --> 01:30:13,260
We'd rather have American money.

2402
01:30:13,620 --> 01:30:19,100
Well, I'd rather have American money and then like, you know, fucking...

2403
01:30:19,100 --> 01:30:24,100
Even if we convert it back to Canadian money, it's still a lot more money.

2404
01:30:25,980 --> 01:30:27,180
Not wrong.

2405
01:30:27,560 --> 01:30:30,720
Give me that fucking sweet old American cash.

2406
01:30:31,080 --> 01:30:32,480
Not Canadian cash.

2407
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:34,940
Oh yeah.

2408
01:30:34,940 --> 01:30:37,820
Yeah, we pay $90 for free fucking new video games.

2409
01:30:37,960 --> 01:30:38,680
That's the best part.

2410
01:30:39,220 --> 01:30:40,220
Oh my god!

2411
01:30:43,460 --> 01:30:43,860
No.

2412
01:30:44,160 --> 01:30:45,160
I hate this shit.

2413
01:30:48,280 --> 01:30:48,680
Alright.

2414
01:30:55,340 --> 01:30:55,740
Basically...

2415
01:30:57,160 --> 01:30:57,920
What was I gonna say?

2416
01:30:58,020 --> 01:30:58,420
What was I gonna say?

2417
01:30:58,560 --> 01:30:58,940
Fuck!

2418
01:30:59,120 --> 01:30:59,500
Sorry.

2419
01:30:59,680 --> 01:31:02,320
It's been so long for me to talk...

2420
01:31:02,320 --> 01:31:07,100
That like, whenever I have something on my mind, it like disappears so fast now.

2421
01:31:07,240 --> 01:31:09,900
Because like, I'm so not... it's like not a routine anymore.

2422
01:31:10,060 --> 01:31:11,640
So it's so... I was like, yeah!

2423
01:31:11,820 --> 01:31:12,180
Idea!

2424
01:31:12,520 --> 01:31:16,000
And then my idea just... it's just no idea.

2425
01:31:16,220 --> 01:31:16,780
No...

2426
01:31:17,660 --> 01:31:19,000
No idea anymore.

2427
01:31:19,800 --> 01:31:22,340
Oh my god, I'm so fucking washed.

2428
01:31:22,620 --> 01:31:24,020
I'm so washed.

2429
01:31:28,020 --> 01:31:31,440
I like how people are still suggesting bad names.

2430
01:31:31,560 --> 01:31:32,200
They're like...

2431
01:31:32,320 --> 01:31:32,960
Okay.

2432
01:31:33,560 --> 01:31:33,920
Yeah.

2433
01:31:34,060 --> 01:31:35,300
You say that.

2434
01:31:35,940 --> 01:31:36,660
Anyway...

2435
01:31:36,660 --> 01:31:38,780
What about free birds?

2436
01:31:45,780 --> 01:31:46,140
Guys!

2437
01:31:49,140 --> 01:31:50,000
We're not...

2438
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,500
We're not gonna be free birds.

2439
01:31:52,740 --> 01:31:53,740
Oh my god!

2440
01:31:53,780 --> 01:31:53,980
Okay.

2441
01:31:55,360 --> 01:31:56,320
So you know how...

2442
01:31:56,560 --> 01:31:57,660
I watched...

2443
01:31:57,660 --> 01:31:59,220
You know how I watched...

2444
01:31:59,220 --> 01:32:00,480
Twilight?

2445
01:32:03,020 --> 01:32:04,100
With my friend?

2446
01:32:05,240 --> 01:32:05,760
And...

2447
01:32:08,240 --> 01:32:11,040
I was like, what the fuck are we watching Twilight?

2448
01:32:11,500 --> 01:32:14,560
And she was like, no, you don't understand.

2449
01:32:15,520 --> 01:32:17,040
It's so good.

2450
01:32:19,560 --> 01:32:20,600
It's like...

2451
01:32:21,180 --> 01:32:22,180
Bad good.

2452
01:32:22,560 --> 01:32:23,480
And then...

2453
01:32:23,480 --> 01:32:24,000
Okay.

2454
01:32:24,260 --> 01:32:24,720
Okay.

2455
01:32:24,740 --> 01:32:26,380
So I need to talk about this.

2456
01:32:26,600 --> 01:32:28,100
I need to talk about this.

2457
01:32:28,700 --> 01:32:29,220
So...

2458
01:32:30,300 --> 01:32:31,340
Thing is...

2459
01:32:32,320 --> 01:32:32,680
Like...

2460
01:32:32,680 --> 01:32:34,240
So the Collins family...

2461
01:32:34,240 --> 01:32:34,540
Alright.

2462
01:32:34,620 --> 01:32:35,940
The whole story is like...

2463
01:32:35,940 --> 01:32:37,440
I didn't realize how fuck...

2464
01:32:37,440 --> 01:32:39,560
How the cinematography is...

2465
01:32:40,420 --> 01:32:40,980
Honestly...

2466
01:32:40,980 --> 01:32:42,700
What the fuck was cinematography?

2467
01:32:43,180 --> 01:32:43,740
But...

2468
01:32:44,320 --> 01:32:44,640
Like...

2469
01:32:45,320 --> 01:32:46,500
The Collins...

2470
01:32:46,500 --> 01:32:48,900
Everyone is fucking their own sibling.

2471
01:32:49,180 --> 01:32:49,440
Sorry.

2472
01:32:49,520 --> 01:32:50,260
Banging their own...

2473
01:32:50,260 --> 01:32:51,920
I don't need to worry about that.

2474
01:32:52,020 --> 01:32:52,400
Anyway...

2475
01:32:52,400 --> 01:32:53,960
Banging their own sibling.

2476
01:32:54,160 --> 01:32:55,040
Like adopted sibling.

2477
01:32:55,200 --> 01:32:56,200
Except for...

2478
01:32:56,200 --> 01:32:57,020
Edward.

2479
01:32:57,580 --> 01:32:58,700
And like...

2480
01:32:58,700 --> 01:32:59,840
And like...

2481
01:32:59,840 --> 01:33:02,200
But then they're like the cool popular kids.

2482
01:33:02,220 --> 01:33:02,300
And then they're like the cool popular kids.

2483
01:33:02,300 --> 01:33:03,540
And I was like...

2484
01:33:03,540 --> 01:33:04,620
I swear to God.

2485
01:33:04,880 --> 01:33:06,880
What the fuck would you think like...

2486
01:33:11,320 --> 01:33:12,320
You're like...

2487
01:33:12,320 --> 01:33:13,280
Oh my God.

2488
01:33:13,300 --> 01:33:14,180
She's so cool.

2489
01:33:14,400 --> 01:33:15,340
She pink...

2490
01:33:15,340 --> 01:33:18,300
Her boyfriend is her adopted brother.

2491
01:33:18,580 --> 01:33:20,200
It's so fucking cool.

2492
01:33:20,720 --> 01:33:21,460
I'm like...

2493
01:33:21,460 --> 01:33:22,080
What the fuck?

2494
01:33:22,420 --> 01:33:22,980
What?

2495
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:24,560
And...

2496
01:33:25,980 --> 01:33:27,380
And the thing is...

2497
01:33:28,400 --> 01:33:28,960
Like...

2498
01:33:28,960 --> 01:33:32,060
You know how the book is written by a Mormon?

2499
01:33:32,220 --> 01:33:32,280
Yeah.

2500
01:33:32,280 --> 01:33:32,900
And then...

2501
01:33:32,900 --> 01:33:33,500
So like...

2502
01:33:33,500 --> 01:33:35,360
So like for her...

2503
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:36,240
It's like...

2504
01:33:36,240 --> 01:33:36,740
You know...

2505
01:33:36,740 --> 01:33:37,660
Oh...

2506
01:33:38,300 --> 01:33:39,820
Only after marriage...

2507
01:33:39,820 --> 01:33:40,420
You know...

2508
01:33:46,900 --> 01:33:47,780
It's like...

2509
01:33:47,780 --> 01:33:48,720
So like...

2510
01:33:48,720 --> 01:33:49,260
Because you know...

2511
01:33:49,260 --> 01:33:49,760
He's like...

2512
01:33:49,760 --> 01:33:50,020
No.

2513
01:33:50,100 --> 01:33:51,280
Only when we're married.

2514
01:33:51,420 --> 01:33:51,760
You know?

2515
01:33:51,880 --> 01:33:52,500
So like...

2516
01:33:52,500 --> 01:33:52,960
I'm thinking...

2517
01:33:52,960 --> 01:33:55,180
Because Edward is a hundred and something years old.

2518
01:33:55,300 --> 01:33:55,640
Right?

2519
01:33:56,240 --> 01:33:58,080
So he's like a hundred year...

2520
01:33:58,080 --> 01:33:58,960
And then I realized.

2521
01:33:59,840 --> 01:34:01,140
I said this...

2522
01:34:01,140 --> 01:34:01,540
I like...

2523
01:34:01,540 --> 01:34:02,260
Said this.

2524
01:34:02,260 --> 01:34:03,780
I said it out loud afterwards.

2525
01:34:03,960 --> 01:34:06,320
I was like, oh my god.

2526
01:34:07,900 --> 01:34:10,240
It was a fucking hundred year old version.

2527
01:34:10,560 --> 01:34:12,020
I was like, oh my god.

2528
01:34:12,120 --> 01:34:17,340
And then like my friend was just like so shocked I said that.

2529
01:34:17,700 --> 01:34:19,980
It didn't click in her head.

2530
01:34:20,320 --> 01:34:22,200
It didn't click in her head.

2531
01:34:22,300 --> 01:34:24,640
Because you know, he's never married.

2532
01:34:30,520 --> 01:34:32,280
He's a super wizard.

2533
01:34:36,540 --> 01:34:41,060
I was like... and then I... but then like the thing is...

2534
01:34:41,060 --> 01:34:43,800
Like one of his adopted siblings was like...

2535
01:34:43,800 --> 01:34:46,140
Was like, I don't like Bella.

2536
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:48,720
Like I don't like Bella.

2537
01:34:48,920 --> 01:34:50,960
I don't want her near us.

2538
01:34:50,960 --> 01:34:51,760
She's a human.

2539
01:34:52,440 --> 01:34:54,060
But like I was like...

2540
01:34:54,060 --> 01:34:54,600
Bro.

2541
01:34:55,860 --> 01:34:57,060
Bro, he's...

2542
01:35:00,120 --> 01:35:02,540
He's just... let him have something.

2543
01:35:03,260 --> 01:35:05,720
You have your fucking adopted brother.

2544
01:35:05,920 --> 01:35:07,460
He has nothing.

2545
01:35:08,060 --> 01:35:09,820
For a hundred years.

2546
01:35:14,300 --> 01:35:16,240
I was like, bro.

2547
01:35:17,020 --> 01:35:18,380
She's like, no.

2548
01:35:18,640 --> 01:35:20,080
I want him to be...

2549
01:35:20,080 --> 01:35:21,640
Single forever.

2550
01:35:24,640 --> 01:35:26,220
I was like, that's so fucked up.

2551
01:35:28,020 --> 01:35:30,600
Anyway, also there's wolf puberty too.

2552
01:35:30,680 --> 01:35:31,780
For those who don't know wolf puberty...

2553
01:35:31,780 --> 01:35:34,800
Okay, so for the context for wolf puberty...

2554
01:35:34,800 --> 01:35:36,000
It's that...

2555
01:35:36,580 --> 01:35:38,980
The context of wolf puberty is that...

2556
01:35:38,980 --> 01:35:41,500
So there's a wolf tribe and like...

2557
01:35:41,940 --> 01:35:45,200
When you hit wolf puberty, you like beef the fuck up.

2558
01:35:45,380 --> 01:35:49,320
So like before... before you hit wolf puberty, you're like this fucking scrawny kid.

2559
01:35:49,440 --> 01:35:50,740
I read the first book of Twilight.

2560
01:35:50,860 --> 01:35:52,480
For those who don't know context wise...

2561
01:35:52,480 --> 01:35:53,860
I try to fit in.

2562
01:35:53,860 --> 01:35:56,540
And like at that time in my volleyball team...

2563
01:35:56,540 --> 01:36:00,200
And then everyone in my volleyball team read Twilight.

2564
01:36:00,420 --> 01:36:01,940
And then they were always like, are you in...

2565
01:36:01,940 --> 01:36:03,620
Are you team Edward or team Jacob?

2566
01:36:03,860 --> 01:36:05,060
So I wanted to fit in.

2567
01:36:05,140 --> 01:36:09,660
Because they would be on a fucking like doggy pile reading Twilight and shit like that.

2568
01:36:09,880 --> 01:36:11,380
So then I was like, oh shit.

2569
01:36:11,480 --> 01:36:11,720
Okay.

2570
01:36:11,800 --> 01:36:14,220
I need to fit in with these girls.

2571
01:36:14,560 --> 01:36:16,600
So I guess I'll read Twilight.

2572
01:36:16,820 --> 01:36:18,860
After I read like up to two books.

2573
01:36:18,940 --> 01:36:19,980
And then after that...

2574
01:36:19,980 --> 01:36:22,160
I still buy the books so I can bring it to practice.

2575
01:36:22,460 --> 01:36:23,840
But like when the book comes out...

2576
01:36:23,840 --> 01:36:25,420
When the newest book comes out...

2577
01:36:25,420 --> 01:36:29,700
I would go to like the Twilight Wikipedia and just read the wiki.

2578
01:36:29,960 --> 01:36:31,320
But I'll pretend to bring...

2579
01:36:31,320 --> 01:36:33,640
I'll bring the book to pretend that I read it.

2580
01:36:33,740 --> 01:36:35,580
So then they'll like ask me about the plot.

2581
01:36:35,780 --> 01:36:36,800
And then I'll just be like...

2582
01:36:36,800 --> 01:36:37,520
I'll just fucking...

2583
01:36:37,520 --> 01:36:39,880
I'll just remember the shit I read on Wikipedia.

2584
01:36:40,040 --> 01:36:41,340
So I didn't have to read the book.

2585
01:36:47,770 --> 01:36:48,190
Because...

2586
01:36:48,190 --> 01:36:50,250
I'm sorry but it was so bad.

2587
01:36:50,690 --> 01:36:51,990
It was so...

2588
01:36:51,990 --> 01:36:54,010
I was just like...

2589
01:36:54,010 --> 01:36:55,710
I just cliff note that shit.

2590
01:36:55,790 --> 01:36:56,410
Because like...

2591
01:36:56,410 --> 01:36:57,870
Anyway, in the book...

2592
01:36:57,870 --> 01:37:01,590
Jacob is like some fucking scrawny ass teenager or some shit.

2593
01:37:01,810 --> 01:37:03,330
But then he hits puberty.

2594
01:37:03,830 --> 01:37:05,310
And then he starts taking off his shirt.

2595
01:37:05,550 --> 01:37:07,070
And like gets like buffer.

2596
01:37:07,310 --> 01:37:08,430
The thing is...

2597
01:37:08,430 --> 01:37:10,470
The actor that plays Jacob...

2598
01:37:10,470 --> 01:37:10,970
Taylor...

2599
01:37:10,970 --> 01:37:12,230
Taylor Lawner...

2600
01:37:12,230 --> 01:37:13,190
By the way...

2601
01:37:13,190 --> 01:37:14,070
He marries...

2602
01:37:14,070 --> 01:37:16,350
His wife is also called Taylor Lawner.

2603
01:37:16,390 --> 01:37:17,750
And so they're Taylor and Taylor.

2604
01:37:18,170 --> 01:37:19,650
I don't fucking know...

2605
01:37:19,650 --> 01:37:20,050
I'm not...

2606
01:37:20,050 --> 01:37:22,930
I don't know what the fuck is going on with that scenario.

2607
01:37:22,930 --> 01:37:24,870
I don't know if that's like a fucking fetish or something.

2608
01:37:25,110 --> 01:37:25,830
But like...

2609
01:37:25,830 --> 01:37:26,610
It has to be.

2610
01:37:26,710 --> 01:37:28,430
Like I feel like it just has to be.

2611
01:37:28,490 --> 01:37:29,530
Like why the fuck would you...

2612
01:37:29,530 --> 01:37:30,110
Oh my god!

2613
01:37:30,310 --> 01:37:31,110
Who are you?

2614
01:37:31,170 --> 01:37:31,990
Taylor Lawner?

2615
01:37:32,370 --> 01:37:32,830
You're...

2616
01:37:32,830 --> 01:37:33,710
Oh my god!

2617
01:37:34,150 --> 01:37:35,070
What a coincidence!

2618
01:37:35,310 --> 01:37:36,390
Now I love you.

2619
01:37:38,630 --> 01:37:39,090
Anyway...

2620
01:37:40,710 --> 01:37:41,170
Anyway...

2621
01:37:41,170 --> 01:37:42,850
But like in the movies...

2622
01:37:43,390 --> 01:37:43,850
Jacob...

2623
01:37:43,850 --> 01:37:45,020
Jacob is like...

2624
01:37:45,930 --> 01:37:46,850
He looks...

2625
01:37:47,990 --> 01:37:49,770
He didn't get skinnier...

2626
01:37:49,770 --> 01:37:50,830
For the role.

2627
01:37:51,210 --> 01:37:52,910
They just put more clothes on him.

2628
01:37:52,930 --> 01:37:53,630
So he...

2629
01:37:53,630 --> 01:37:54,970
They just...

2630
01:37:58,610 --> 01:37:59,110
Like...

2631
01:37:59,110 --> 01:38:00,430
You can tell...

2632
01:38:00,430 --> 01:38:01,930
You can tell like...

2633
01:38:01,930 --> 01:38:03,890
He didn't want to force him to like...

2634
01:38:03,890 --> 01:38:05,530
Bulk up for the second movie.

2635
01:38:06,010 --> 01:38:07,070
So like...

2636
01:38:07,070 --> 01:38:08,710
You can tell that they're like...

2637
01:38:08,710 --> 01:38:10,850
How the fuck do we make him look like...

2638
01:38:10,850 --> 01:38:11,510
Uh...

2639
01:38:11,510 --> 01:38:13,270
Like a scrawny ass stick.

2640
01:38:13,590 --> 01:38:16,150
Let's just put like 500 layers of clothes on him.

2641
01:38:16,290 --> 01:38:17,430
And give him long hair.

2642
01:38:17,730 --> 01:38:19,950
To hide his like fucking muscle or some shit.

2643
01:38:20,170 --> 01:38:22,390
And then like when he hits wolf puberty...

2644
01:38:22,390 --> 01:38:23,210
Let's just give...

2645
01:38:23,210 --> 01:38:24,710
Make him shirtless and cut his hair.

2646
01:38:24,890 --> 01:38:26,150
So it looks like...

2647
01:38:26,150 --> 01:38:27,570
He hit wolf puberty.

2648
01:38:28,550 --> 01:38:29,070
So...

2649
01:38:29,630 --> 01:38:31,010
That's a little fun fact.

2650
01:38:31,330 --> 01:38:32,290
I wanted...

2651
01:38:33,710 --> 01:38:34,230
Also...

2652
01:38:35,170 --> 01:38:36,590
Yes, I'll confirm...

2653
01:38:36,590 --> 01:38:38,570
That she was like...

2654
01:38:38,570 --> 01:38:40,010
Here comes the next best part!

2655
01:38:40,270 --> 01:38:41,790
And then she literally was like...

2656
01:38:41,790 --> 01:38:42,670
Spider monkey!

2657
01:38:42,930 --> 01:38:43,890
I was just like...

2658
01:38:43,890 --> 01:38:44,390
What the fuck?

2659
01:38:44,670 --> 01:38:46,870
I was just like...

2660
01:38:47,770 --> 01:38:48,430
I was just like...

2661
01:38:48,430 --> 01:38:49,270
What the fuck?

2662
01:38:51,250 --> 01:38:52,370
I was just like...

2663
01:38:52,370 --> 01:38:52,790
We have scuba diving here.

2664
01:38:52,790 --> 01:38:52,810
We literally watched...

2665
01:38:52,810 --> 01:38:56,070
We also like...

2666
01:38:56,070 --> 01:38:56,830
Well...

2667
01:38:58,170 --> 01:38:58,930
Yeah...

2668
01:38:58,930 --> 01:39:01,530
We watched live action Pinnochio.

2669
01:39:03,090 --> 01:39:03,870
Just like...

2670
01:39:03,870 --> 01:39:04,750
I was like...

2671
01:39:05,230 --> 01:39:05,890
I was just like you...

2672
01:39:05,890 --> 01:39:06,690
I told her I was like...

2673
01:39:06,690 --> 01:39:07,470
Oh, no.

2674
01:39:07,530 --> 01:39:08,070
You don't understand.

2675
01:39:08,370 --> 01:39:08,710
Like...

2676
01:39:08,710 --> 01:39:12,390
The live action Disney movies are a...

2677
01:39:15,790 --> 01:39:19,370
And she's never really watched live action Disney movies.

2678
01:39:19,570 --> 01:39:20,650
So like...

2679
01:39:20,650 --> 01:39:22,330
Like that is THE luck I have I found.

2680
01:39:22,330 --> 01:39:22,350
Sometimes I wonder if I shouldN .

2681
01:39:22,350 --> 01:39:27,570
I... Live Action Pinocchio... Okay, you know how like the reviews for Live Action Pinocchio...

2682
01:39:28,570 --> 01:39:32,010
Like... It's like fucking, I don't know, like 20% or some shit.

2683
01:39:32,250 --> 01:39:34,670
I don't... I can't... I don't really know the numbers on top of my head.

2684
01:39:34,870 --> 01:39:36,670
But then you're like, it can't be that bad.

2685
01:39:36,790 --> 01:39:38,210
Like how... how can you fuck up?

2686
01:39:38,410 --> 01:39:39,770
There's... Tom Hanks is in there.

2687
01:39:40,030 --> 01:39:42,070
Like how... how...

2688
01:39:42,650 --> 01:39:43,770
How does that work?

2689
01:39:44,170 --> 01:39:46,530
Literally... Tom Hanks is in there.

2690
01:39:48,070 --> 01:39:48,470
And...

2691
01:39:49,350 --> 01:39:50,930
The thing is...

2692
01:39:52,350 --> 01:39:52,850
It...

2693
01:39:55,250 --> 01:39:58,370
We... we like watched, I think...

2694
01:39:58,370 --> 01:40:02,310
15 minutes of Live Action Pinocchio.

2695
01:40:02,790 --> 01:40:04,210
And we're like...

2696
01:40:04,210 --> 01:40:07,010
Alright, let's pop in real Pinocchio.

2697
01:40:07,170 --> 01:40:08,710
Like this is...

2698
01:40:10,470 --> 01:40:10,970
I...

2699
01:40:11,710 --> 01:40:12,830
It's... it's...

2700
01:40:12,830 --> 01:40:13,930
Oh my god.

2701
01:40:14,210 --> 01:40:15,310
It is...

2702
01:40:16,110 --> 01:40:18,690
Like... Tom Hanks cannot save that...

2703
01:40:18,690 --> 01:40:20,510
Fucking... movie.

2704
01:40:23,590 --> 01:40:27,010
We... we only kept watching... for the fox.

2705
01:40:27,550 --> 01:40:33,010
Because we want... because like I was like, no... the fox... the... the... the 3D...

2706
01:40:33,010 --> 01:40:34,910
No, you don't understand the 3D animation for the fox.

2707
01:40:34,970 --> 01:40:39,370
For some fucking reason, they cut 90% of the budget for the main character Pinocchio.

2708
01:40:39,530 --> 01:40:41,430
And then put it all on the fucking fox.

2709
01:40:41,710 --> 01:40:45,130
Because why the fuck does he... the fox look like that...

2710
01:40:45,130 --> 01:40:46,790
And then you look at Pinocchio.

2711
01:40:49,130 --> 01:40:52,210
The fox is on... is on like 600 frames.

2712
01:40:52,270 --> 01:40:52,330
The fox is on...

2713
01:40:52,330 --> 01:40:52,330
is on like 600 frames.

2714
01:40:52,330 --> 01:40:52,830
Per second.

2715
01:40:53,030 --> 01:40:55,290
And Pinocchio is like, I don't know...

2716
01:40:56,230 --> 01:40:57,550
Fox is like...

2717
01:40:58,570 --> 01:41:00,210
4080 RTX on.

2718
01:41:00,690 --> 01:41:02,630
Pinocchio is like... Flash games.

2719
01:41:02,970 --> 01:41:03,890
And I don't understand.

2720
01:41:09,550 --> 01:41:12,810
Like that... that... that is the... the...

2721
01:41:13,710 --> 01:41:16,690
That is the craziest part of all of that.

2722
01:41:16,890 --> 01:41:17,250
Alright.

2723
01:41:17,370 --> 01:41:18,750
I'm gonna ask for...

2724
01:41:18,750 --> 01:41:20,830
I'm gonna ask for the fucking...

2725
01:41:20,830 --> 01:41:22,250
For the fucking story.

2726
01:41:22,330 --> 01:41:23,590
I'm gonna ask for the store update real quick.

2727
01:41:24,730 --> 01:41:25,370
How...

2728
01:41:25,930 --> 01:41:28,310
How is the store update?

2729
01:41:33,330 --> 01:41:34,950
I swear to God.

2730
01:41:35,130 --> 01:41:35,290
I...

2731
01:41:35,610 --> 01:41:36,470
I don't understand.

2732
01:41:37,210 --> 01:41:38,890
Pinocchio is the main character.

2733
01:41:39,710 --> 01:41:40,810
I don't understand.

2734
01:41:42,010 --> 01:41:42,650
Um...

2735
01:41:42,650 --> 01:41:44,130
Anyway, that's what I was saying.

2736
01:41:45,830 --> 01:41:46,470
Uh...

2737
01:41:46,990 --> 01:41:48,290
What are my plans for next week?

2738
01:41:48,450 --> 01:41:49,670
I definitely wanna do like...

2739
01:41:49,670 --> 01:41:51,770
I definitely wanna play Neopets.

2740
01:41:51,770 --> 01:41:52,790
For the first gaming stream.

2741
01:41:53,050 --> 01:41:55,510
And then I wanna line up a bunch of collabs.

2742
01:41:55,750 --> 01:41:56,630
Uh... going in.

2743
01:41:57,670 --> 01:41:58,110
And...

2744
01:41:58,790 --> 01:42:00,670
I... I feel like a lot of you guys...

2745
01:42:00,670 --> 01:42:01,890
might have this question.

2746
01:42:02,070 --> 01:42:03,070
Meaning like...

2747
01:42:03,070 --> 01:42:03,750
Oh!

2748
01:42:05,990 --> 01:42:06,430
Uh...

2749
01:42:06,430 --> 01:42:07,950
What are some of your events you wanna plan?

2750
01:42:09,310 --> 01:42:09,750
Um...

2751
01:42:09,750 --> 01:42:11,770
One of the events I really, really, really wanna do...

2752
01:42:11,770 --> 01:42:14,210
Is a big...

2753
01:42:15,430 --> 01:42:16,310
A big...

2754
01:42:16,310 --> 01:42:17,330
Wrestling event.

2755
01:42:17,590 --> 01:42:19,070
With a lot of different...

2756
01:42:19,930 --> 01:42:20,810
Indies and...

2757
01:42:20,810 --> 01:42:21,530
And...

2758
01:42:21,530 --> 01:42:22,390
Vtuber companies.

2759
01:42:22,450 --> 01:42:23,250
In NA.

2760
01:42:23,530 --> 01:42:24,810
I think it'll be really fun!

2761
01:42:25,070 --> 01:42:26,250
I think it'll be really fun.

2762
01:42:27,330 --> 01:42:27,850
And...

2763
01:42:27,850 --> 01:42:28,390
Um...

2764
01:42:28,390 --> 01:42:29,930
I really wanna order...

2765
01:42:30,430 --> 01:42:31,810
I really wanna order...

2766
01:42:31,810 --> 01:42:32,310
Uh...

2767
01:42:32,310 --> 01:42:33,030
Some...

2768
01:42:33,030 --> 01:42:34,030
Enamel pins.

2769
01:42:34,790 --> 01:42:37,410
To give out to everybody who participates as well.

2770
01:42:37,730 --> 01:42:38,450
It'll be...

2771
01:42:38,450 --> 01:42:39,410
I think that...

2772
01:42:39,410 --> 01:42:41,950
That's definitely some future plans that I really wanna do.

2773
01:42:42,010 --> 01:42:43,250
Some projects that I really wanna do.

2774
01:42:43,390 --> 01:42:45,190
I really wanna organize...

2775
01:42:45,190 --> 01:42:45,990
Uh...

2776
01:42:45,990 --> 01:42:47,330
Some mini...

2777
01:42:47,970 --> 01:42:48,310
Um...

2778
01:42:48,310 --> 01:42:49,230
Some tournaments.

2779
01:42:49,550 --> 01:42:50,070
Like...

2780
01:42:50,070 --> 01:42:50,890
For different games.

2781
01:42:51,530 --> 01:42:51,990
Uh...

2782
01:42:53,150 --> 01:42:53,950
And stuff.

2783
01:42:54,830 --> 01:42:55,390
And...

2784
01:42:55,390 --> 01:42:56,230
Uh...

2785
01:42:56,230 --> 01:42:57,810
With prizes and everything.

2786
01:42:57,950 --> 01:42:58,950
And trophies.

2787
01:42:59,590 --> 01:43:00,150
Um...

2788
01:43:01,230 --> 01:43:02,770
And physical trophies.

2789
01:43:03,550 --> 01:43:04,110
Um...

2790
01:43:05,650 --> 01:43:06,970
I think it'll be really fun!

2791
01:43:07,210 --> 01:43:07,950
I think like...

2792
01:43:07,950 --> 01:43:11,790
The most fun events are the ones that you can be super creative about.

2793
01:43:12,710 --> 01:43:13,270
And...

2794
01:43:13,270 --> 01:43:14,110
Uh...

2795
01:43:14,110 --> 01:43:14,790
Have like...

2796
01:43:14,790 --> 01:43:16,170
Something to cheer on for.

2797
01:43:17,130 --> 01:43:17,690
Uh...

2798
01:43:18,870 --> 01:43:21,290
Yeah that's like some of the projects and events...

2799
01:43:21,290 --> 01:43:23,910
I really want to plan out...

2800
01:43:26,630 --> 01:43:28,930
In a call, give me five...

2801
01:43:28,930 --> 01:43:29,170
No!

2802
01:43:29,590 --> 01:43:30,430
Mr... Okay.

2803
01:43:31,430 --> 01:43:32,990
Leave that call.

2804
01:43:36,710 --> 01:43:43,470
I wonder if Mr. Man would take that seriously or not.

2805
01:43:43,590 --> 01:43:45,630
He's not even watching the first stream anyway.

2806
01:43:45,650 --> 01:43:47,950
He doesn't fucking know if I'm serious or not.

2807
01:43:47,950 --> 01:43:48,930
Okay.

2808
01:43:49,190 --> 01:43:50,770
Open store.

2809
01:43:53,910 --> 01:43:55,330
Okay, I'll just write JK.

2810
01:44:03,750 --> 01:44:05,590
I want to do escape rooms.

2811
01:44:05,790 --> 01:44:06,770
I want to do like...

2812
01:44:07,390 --> 01:44:09,170
Minecraft escape rooms.

2813
01:44:09,310 --> 01:44:10,210
And like...

2814
01:44:10,210 --> 01:44:12,050
Pit people against each other.

2815
01:44:12,690 --> 01:44:14,790
That shit would be so fun.

2816
01:44:15,130 --> 01:44:16,310
And then you'd be like...

2817
01:44:16,310 --> 01:44:17,290
Oh my god, which...

2818
01:44:18,330 --> 01:44:18,810
Which...

2819
01:44:18,810 --> 01:44:19,770
And then you guys can like...

2820
01:44:19,770 --> 01:44:20,950
Cheer on for like...

2821
01:44:20,950 --> 01:44:21,490
Which team...

2822
01:44:21,490 --> 01:44:22,890
Of our team and stuff like that.

2823
01:44:22,990 --> 01:44:24,010
That would be so fucking fun.

2824
01:44:24,150 --> 01:44:25,950
I feel like there's not a lot of like...

2825
01:44:27,010 --> 01:44:27,490
Um...

2826
01:44:28,110 --> 01:44:29,510
Like there's a lot of like...

2827
01:44:29,510 --> 01:44:31,070
MCC for like...

2828
01:44:31,070 --> 01:44:32,450
Minecraft content creators.

2829
01:44:32,750 --> 01:44:34,010
But you don't see like...

2830
01:44:34,010 --> 01:44:36,290
A lot of MCC for like...

2831
01:44:36,290 --> 01:44:37,610
Vtubers as well.

2832
01:44:37,890 --> 01:44:40,330
So I want to do like a Vtuber MCC.

2833
01:44:40,630 --> 01:44:43,630
Plan a Vtuber type MCC and stuff.

2834
01:44:43,730 --> 01:44:44,690
With like mini games.

2835
01:44:44,970 --> 01:44:45,670
And everything.

2836
01:44:45,890 --> 01:44:46,970
Because like...

2837
01:44:46,970 --> 01:44:48,690
Oh my god, I can do so many things.

2838
01:44:48,790 --> 01:44:51,050
I can do so many plans.

2839
01:44:51,210 --> 01:44:52,050
And projects.

2840
01:44:52,870 --> 01:44:53,210
And...

2841
01:44:53,550 --> 01:44:53,890
Uh...

2842
01:44:53,890 --> 01:44:55,230
League games.

2843
01:45:00,410 --> 01:45:01,090
Uh...

2844
01:45:02,130 --> 01:45:03,290
Obviously Apex.

2845
01:45:03,310 --> 01:45:04,190
Of course, of course.

2846
01:45:04,430 --> 01:45:04,810
Uh...

2847
01:45:04,810 --> 01:45:05,990
I actually do have like...

2848
01:45:06,730 --> 01:45:07,210
Uh...

2849
01:45:07,210 --> 01:45:08,250
An Apex...

2850
01:45:08,250 --> 01:45:09,210
Tournament.

2851
01:45:09,490 --> 01:45:11,430
That I'm working on.

2852
01:45:11,690 --> 01:45:13,470
With some best...

2853
01:45:13,470 --> 01:45:14,650
Some besties.

2854
01:45:14,770 --> 01:45:15,330
Hahaha.

2855
01:45:15,890 --> 01:45:16,230
Hahaha.

2856
01:45:16,230 --> 01:45:16,730
Hahaha.

2857
01:45:18,830 --> 01:45:19,430
Hahaha.

2858
01:45:19,510 --> 01:45:19,570
Hahaha.

2859
01:45:19,970 --> 01:45:20,230
Hahaha.

2860
01:45:20,830 --> 01:45:21,430
So...

2861
01:45:22,030 --> 01:45:23,850
That's something to look forward to as well.

2862
01:45:24,750 --> 01:45:25,350
Um...

2863
01:45:25,350 --> 01:45:25,970
That's right!

2864
01:45:26,030 --> 01:45:27,110
We're still the besties!

2865
01:45:27,650 --> 01:45:27,950
Hahaha.

2866
01:45:27,950 --> 01:45:29,090
We're still there!

2867
01:45:29,750 --> 01:45:30,350
Hahaha.

2868
01:45:30,570 --> 01:45:31,790
We're still there!

2869
01:45:32,310 --> 01:45:32,910
Hahaha.

2870
01:45:33,970 --> 01:45:34,570
Hahaha.

2871
01:45:34,570 --> 01:45:35,090
Um...

2872
01:45:36,590 --> 01:45:37,190
And...

2873
01:45:37,190 --> 01:45:39,590
Honestly, like I said, there's so many ideas.

2874
01:45:39,970 --> 01:45:40,570
And...

2875
01:45:40,950 --> 01:45:41,250
Um...

2876
01:45:41,250 --> 01:45:43,150
I'm really excited to plan all of that.

2877
01:45:43,810 --> 01:45:44,410
With...

2878
01:45:44,410 --> 01:45:45,030
Uh...

2879
01:45:45,030 --> 01:45:45,910
With my manager.

2880
01:45:47,030 --> 01:45:47,470
And...

2881
01:45:47,470 --> 01:45:48,270
I cannot wait.

2882
01:45:48,330 --> 01:45:49,010
I really cannot wait.

2883
01:45:49,110 --> 01:45:49,310
I...

2884
01:45:49,310 --> 01:45:50,710
I cannot wait!

2885
01:45:50,850 --> 01:45:51,570
I cannot wait.

2886
01:45:51,590 --> 01:45:52,370
I cannot wait to get started.

2887
01:45:52,970 --> 01:45:53,410
I...

2888
01:45:53,410 --> 01:45:54,410
I'm so excited.

2889
01:45:54,450 --> 01:45:54,890
Honestly.

2890
01:45:55,750 --> 01:45:56,190
Uh...

2891
01:45:56,190 --> 01:45:56,710
Oh yeah.

2892
01:45:56,730 --> 01:45:58,230
For those who don't know what MCC is.

2893
01:45:58,290 --> 01:45:59,350
It's like the Minecraft Championship.

2894
01:45:59,690 --> 01:46:02,410
But usually it's like something you see for Minecrafters.

2895
01:46:02,410 --> 01:46:03,850
Like Minecraft content creators.

2896
01:46:04,090 --> 01:46:05,490
But honestly, I haven't seen one of those.

2897
01:46:05,590 --> 01:46:06,850
I really want to do like...

2898
01:46:06,850 --> 01:46:09,550
I feel like a lot of tournaments and a lot of events.

2899
01:46:09,810 --> 01:46:12,790
They're like always regulated into like one...

2900
01:46:12,790 --> 01:46:13,970
One company.

2901
01:46:14,050 --> 01:46:14,390
Like...

2902
01:46:14,390 --> 01:46:16,830
I think it'd be really fun to have like an...

2903
01:46:17,390 --> 01:46:17,930
Uh...

2904
01:46:17,930 --> 01:46:20,310
A company wide...

2905
01:46:20,310 --> 01:46:20,730
Oh!

2906
01:46:20,790 --> 01:46:23,130
Like team indies and like...

2907
01:46:23,130 --> 01:46:24,370
And like...

2908
01:46:24,370 --> 01:46:24,890
Like...

2909
01:46:24,890 --> 01:46:25,530
Like different...

2910
01:46:25,530 --> 01:46:27,730
Different like companies and NA...

2911
01:46:27,730 --> 01:46:28,410
Uh...

2912
01:46:28,410 --> 01:46:29,670
Participating and stuff.

2913
01:46:29,730 --> 01:46:32,490
And like fan bases from different areas.

2914
01:46:32,870 --> 01:46:33,870
Like watching.

2915
01:46:33,970 --> 01:46:34,770
I think that would be really fun.

2916
01:46:34,990 --> 01:46:35,470
I really think.

2917
01:46:35,650 --> 01:46:39,670
Cause you always see like tournaments and events usually from one...

2918
01:46:39,670 --> 01:46:40,730
One company.

2919
01:46:41,110 --> 01:46:43,490
I think it'd be really cool to have like...

2920
01:46:43,490 --> 01:46:44,390
Uh...

2921
01:46:44,390 --> 01:46:49,730
To set something up where people from different companies can participate and stuff.

2922
01:46:50,210 --> 01:46:50,730
So...

2923
01:46:50,730 --> 01:46:51,070
Yeah!

2924
01:46:51,350 --> 01:46:52,750
I want to do something like that.

2925
01:46:52,930 --> 01:46:53,290
Alright!

2926
01:46:53,390 --> 01:46:53,610
Okay!

2927
01:46:53,730 --> 01:46:53,910
Okay!

2928
01:46:53,930 --> 01:46:54,370
I see it.

2929
01:46:54,390 --> 01:46:54,750
Pow world.

2930
01:46:55,330 --> 01:46:56,390
I'm gonna say it!

2931
01:46:58,310 --> 01:47:02,490
After you play like three days of Pow World non-stop...

2932
01:47:04,550 --> 01:47:05,490
Like you...

2933
01:47:05,490 --> 01:47:06,350
It's...

2934
01:47:06,350 --> 01:47:06,750
That's it.

2935
01:47:11,350 --> 01:47:13,470
I'm gonna fucking say it!

2936
01:47:14,450 --> 01:47:15,690
You realize!

2937
01:47:16,510 --> 01:47:17,250
It's...

2938
01:47:17,250 --> 01:47:17,970
It's fun.

2939
01:47:18,310 --> 01:47:18,870
It's fun.

2940
01:47:19,150 --> 01:47:20,250
But like...

2941
01:47:20,250 --> 01:47:23,490
When you hit three days of Pow World...

2942
01:47:23,490 --> 01:47:27,290
You hit a point where you're like...

2943
01:47:27,290 --> 01:47:27,910
Alright.

2944
01:47:28,050 --> 01:47:29,110
I realize.

2945
01:47:29,510 --> 01:47:31,510
After three days...

2946
01:47:31,510 --> 01:47:33,050
It's like the same thing.

2947
01:47:33,450 --> 01:47:34,710
It's like...

2948
01:47:38,070 --> 01:47:39,310
And like...

2949
01:47:39,310 --> 01:47:42,050
Honestly like it just needs like more...

2950
01:47:42,050 --> 01:47:43,190
Uh...

2951
01:47:43,190 --> 01:47:43,470
Intuitiveness.

2952
01:47:43,470 --> 01:47:46,850
It needs more updates to keep me interested.

2953
01:47:47,290 --> 01:47:48,990
But like the thing about Pow World...

2954
01:47:48,990 --> 01:47:51,290
The thing about Pow World is that like...

2955
01:47:52,430 --> 01:47:52,970
Um...

2956
01:47:52,970 --> 01:47:54,070
It is very fun.

2957
01:47:54,130 --> 01:47:55,910
It's a very fun unique concept and...

2958
01:47:56,470 --> 01:47:57,410
Honestly like...

2959
01:47:57,410 --> 01:47:59,390
That's what we need.

2960
01:47:59,530 --> 01:48:02,470
Like I wish we had that in other similar...

2961
01:48:04,330 --> 01:48:05,430
Wait I can say it now.

2962
01:48:05,590 --> 01:48:06,370
In Pokemon!

2963
01:48:10,750 --> 01:48:13,450
Sorry my inner filter fucking killed me.

2964
01:48:13,470 --> 01:48:13,810
I'm kicked in.

2965
01:48:19,290 --> 01:48:20,770
Because I liked...

2966
01:48:20,770 --> 01:48:21,550
Like...

2967
01:48:21,550 --> 01:48:24,030
It was Pokemon Legends Arceus or whatever.

2968
01:48:24,370 --> 01:48:24,730
That one.

2969
01:48:24,870 --> 01:48:25,090
Was that...

2970
01:48:25,090 --> 01:48:25,810
Was that one?

2971
01:48:25,890 --> 01:48:26,770
I really liked that one.

2972
01:48:26,830 --> 01:48:28,270
I really really liked that game.

2973
01:48:29,690 --> 01:48:30,170
And...

2974
01:48:30,170 --> 01:48:30,690
Um...

2975
01:48:30,690 --> 01:48:31,670
I wish...

2976
01:48:31,670 --> 01:48:32,770
I wish...

2977
01:48:32,770 --> 01:48:33,450
Uh...

2978
01:48:33,450 --> 01:48:37,150
I wish Pokemon can be similar as well.

2979
01:48:37,330 --> 01:48:38,190
The fucking...

2980
01:48:38,190 --> 01:48:38,970
Mr. Man.

2981
01:48:39,270 --> 01:48:41,610
I cannot stall Mr. Man.

2982
01:48:41,890 --> 01:48:42,570
Wait I...

2983
01:48:42,570 --> 01:48:43,450
Why did I type Mr. Man?

2984
01:48:43,470 --> 01:48:44,670
I know like...

2985
01:48:44,670 --> 01:48:47,050
I cannot stall...

2986
01:48:48,470 --> 01:48:49,070
Anymore.

2987
01:48:58,050 --> 01:49:01,150
Give me a story.

2988
01:49:06,030 --> 01:49:07,190
But yeah.

2989
01:49:08,070 --> 01:49:10,070
I think like streaming...

2990
01:49:10,070 --> 01:49:11,630
Is...

2991
01:49:11,630 --> 01:49:12,830
A great...

2992
01:49:12,830 --> 01:49:13,450
It's just...

2993
01:49:14,310 --> 01:49:18,950
When you start streaming, I don't know, streaming always makes me a lot happier.

2994
01:49:19,210 --> 01:49:23,670
And when I couldn't stream, I felt so empty.

2995
01:49:23,810 --> 01:49:24,630
Oh my god.

2996
01:49:24,770 --> 01:49:31,790
I felt... I've been in a routine for so long that when...

2997
01:49:33,670 --> 01:49:40,730
when you suddenly stop streaming, it's just...

2998
01:49:40,730 --> 01:49:45,050
It's like, what do I do with my life at that point?

2999
01:49:45,190 --> 01:49:51,450
Because you've been in this routine for so... so fucking long.

3000
01:49:51,790 --> 01:49:58,350
And it just makes me so happy being able to just stream and laugh with you guys.

3001
01:49:58,530 --> 01:50:02,230
And talk about the dumbest fucking thing.

3002
01:50:06,410 --> 01:50:10,450
Just have fucking people enable the shit.

3003
01:50:10,450 --> 01:50:10,710
Or other people enable the shit.

3004
01:50:10,730 --> 01:50:12,550
And just have fucking people enable the shit.

3005
01:50:13,830 --> 01:50:21,070
And I think my therapist was right when he was like, Oh, you seem very different now.

3006
01:50:21,590 --> 01:50:24,090
After, compared to the other times.

3007
01:50:24,110 --> 01:50:24,670
Oh my god.

3008
01:50:24,790 --> 01:50:27,130
Compared to the other times, I'm fucking...

3009
01:50:27,130 --> 01:50:28,490
Oh fuck man.

3010
01:50:31,890 --> 01:50:35,050
It was like, yeah, you seem very...

3011
01:50:35,850 --> 01:50:37,010
Very different.

3012
01:50:37,290 --> 01:50:40,590
And you actually seem like you...

3013
01:50:40,730 --> 01:50:42,590
You have a purpose in life again.

3014
01:50:42,850 --> 01:50:43,850
And he's right.

3015
01:50:44,070 --> 01:50:44,790
He's right.

3016
01:50:45,210 --> 01:50:50,870
I felt like I have a purpose and I have...

3017
01:50:50,870 --> 01:50:52,590
I'm a very goal-oriented person.

3018
01:50:52,950 --> 01:50:57,830
And being a very goal-oriented person...

3019
01:51:00,090 --> 01:51:02,190
I always like to plan the next thing.

3020
01:51:02,330 --> 01:51:03,830
To do something and everything.

3021
01:51:04,290 --> 01:51:05,650
To always...

3022
01:51:06,830 --> 01:51:08,250
To always just...

3023
01:51:08,250 --> 01:51:09,730
I just always want to do something.

3024
01:51:09,730 --> 01:51:12,670
I always want to keep my mind busy.

3025
01:51:13,270 --> 01:51:15,910
So it's nice because my mind has been like...

3026
01:51:16,450 --> 01:51:18,190
Chugga chugga choo choo for...

3027
01:51:20,810 --> 01:51:23,110
For the last two days.

3028
01:51:23,230 --> 01:51:25,710
And honestly, I...

3029
01:51:26,870 --> 01:51:28,730
It's nice to be busy again.

3030
01:51:28,870 --> 01:51:30,450
It's nice to have stuff to do.

3031
01:51:30,570 --> 01:51:33,110
I really do need to fix my sleep schedule though.

3032
01:51:33,450 --> 01:51:36,870
Holy shit, my sleep schedule is fucking horrendous.

3033
01:51:37,750 --> 01:51:39,510
I haven't had a normal sleep schedule.

3034
01:51:39,510 --> 01:51:40,530
In so long.

3035
01:51:40,590 --> 01:51:42,510
I tried to fix it for a while.

3036
01:51:42,770 --> 01:51:45,670
But it hasn't been working.

3037
01:51:45,830 --> 01:51:47,830
Because I've been a degenerate for so long.

3038
01:51:47,950 --> 01:51:49,250
Back to back to back to back.

3039
01:51:50,150 --> 01:51:50,550
That...

3040
01:51:53,170 --> 01:51:53,970
That like...

3041
01:51:54,930 --> 01:51:55,330
It...

3042
01:51:55,330 --> 01:51:56,870
Honestly, I'm just...

3043
01:51:56,870 --> 01:51:57,410
Oh my god.

3044
01:51:57,450 --> 01:51:59,990
It's just gonna take a bit to rebuild myself.

3045
01:52:00,390 --> 01:52:01,810
But it really...

3046
01:52:03,810 --> 01:52:05,790
It really, really is...

3047
01:52:05,790 --> 01:52:07,230
All right, let me read you...

3048
01:52:07,230 --> 01:52:08,330
Sorry, Mr. Man.

3049
01:52:08,370 --> 01:52:09,150
I'm gonna read your messages.

3050
01:52:09,150 --> 01:52:10,470
I'll do all these people.

3051
01:52:11,390 --> 01:52:13,730
These extra stuff, ma'am.

3052
01:52:14,410 --> 01:52:15,330
Domain and whatnot.

3053
01:52:16,410 --> 01:52:17,370
So like...

3054
01:52:17,370 --> 01:52:20,530
I'm making sure there's no potential security issues.

3055
01:52:20,570 --> 01:52:21,530
Ria and Intu.

3056
01:52:22,030 --> 01:52:22,850
Open the...

3057
01:52:22,850 --> 01:52:24,710
Okay, no, actually we'll be so fucked up.

3058
01:52:30,820 --> 01:52:31,980
So fucked up.

3059
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:33,780
I opened the floodgates and then I...

3060
01:52:33,780 --> 01:52:36,120
Whoa, whoa, Doki got hacked.

3061
01:52:36,320 --> 01:52:36,980
And I was like, what?

3062
01:52:37,060 --> 01:52:37,320
How?

3063
01:52:37,600 --> 01:52:37,960
What?

3064
01:52:38,020 --> 01:52:42,800
You mean me rushing Mr. Man to open the store and not looking to safety precautions?

3065
01:52:43,960 --> 01:52:48,040
Actually made me get hacked?

3066
01:52:48,360 --> 01:52:50,560
Whoa, really?

3067
01:52:51,680 --> 01:52:52,840
No way.

3068
01:52:53,940 --> 01:52:55,760
This is what it means to be an indie?

3069
01:52:59,520 --> 01:53:01,560
Actual concern about website security?

3070
01:53:02,260 --> 01:53:03,460
What the fuck?

3071
01:53:03,900 --> 01:53:05,440
Also so for those who don't know.

3072
01:53:07,120 --> 01:53:11,000
There is going to be a limited...

3073
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:12,640
So like...

3074
01:53:12,640 --> 01:53:16,720
There's gonna be new things for the merch.

3075
01:53:16,980 --> 01:53:18,540
I've added some new stuff there.

3076
01:53:18,680 --> 01:53:25,520
For one, I added a limited bundle of the rock...

3077
01:53:25,520 --> 01:53:26,300
What is it?

3078
01:53:26,360 --> 01:53:27,200
Sorry, rock...

3079
01:53:27,200 --> 01:53:29,560
Robbank bundle.

3080
01:53:30,220 --> 01:53:34,800
And it's only limited to like 100 stock.

3081
01:53:35,480 --> 01:53:36,160
And...

3082
01:53:38,240 --> 01:53:40,520
It's only limited to 100 stock.

3083
01:53:40,580 --> 01:53:41,980
And it has a...

3084
01:53:41,980 --> 01:53:42,620
A...

3085
01:53:43,500 --> 01:53:44,540
Signed postcard.

3086
01:53:44,680 --> 01:53:46,740
Like hand signed postcard from me.

3087
01:53:46,920 --> 01:53:47,940
Plus like a...

3088
01:53:47,940 --> 01:53:48,440
I think...

3089
01:53:48,440 --> 01:53:49,360
I think that's right.

3090
01:53:49,580 --> 01:53:51,160
I don't remember what I wrote.

3091
01:53:54,040 --> 01:53:54,960
I guess so...

3092
01:53:54,960 --> 01:53:55,640
I don't know.

3093
01:53:56,180 --> 01:53:56,700
I've...

3094
01:53:56,700 --> 01:53:57,560
I haven't...

3095
01:53:58,120 --> 01:53:59,080
Oh my god, no.

3096
01:53:59,160 --> 01:53:59,380
Wait.

3097
01:53:59,600 --> 01:54:00,080
Okay.

3098
01:54:00,140 --> 01:54:02,360
So like I'm so fucked with the Etsy.

3099
01:54:02,440 --> 01:54:03,640
There's so many orders.

3100
01:54:05,080 --> 01:54:08,200
Thank you guys so much for the support.

3101
01:54:08,620 --> 01:54:09,740
Thank you everybody.

3102
01:54:10,860 --> 01:54:11,380
I...

3103
01:54:11,380 --> 01:54:13,100
But also I'm so fucked.

3104
01:54:13,900 --> 01:54:17,360
I have 200 plus orders.

3105
01:54:18,020 --> 01:54:19,240
Oh my god.

3106
01:54:19,860 --> 01:54:20,500
Um...

3107
01:54:20,500 --> 01:54:24,420
To like my mom and I to package and everything.

3108
01:54:24,580 --> 01:54:27,740
There's 200 plus orders for my mom and I to package.

3109
01:54:28,740 --> 01:54:29,380
And...

3110
01:54:30,260 --> 01:54:30,900
Uh...

3111
01:54:30,900 --> 01:54:31,720
Can you be...

3112
01:54:31,720 --> 01:54:32,740
No, what the fuck?

3113
01:54:32,980 --> 01:54:34,980
Can it be signed by Mr. Man?

3114
01:54:35,160 --> 01:54:36,320
What the fuck?

3115
01:54:37,300 --> 01:54:39,920
You met Mr. Man today!

3116
01:54:40,520 --> 01:54:41,360
Like what?

3117
01:54:41,360 --> 01:54:41,660
What?

3118
01:54:42,480 --> 01:54:44,020
What the fuck do you mean?

3119
01:54:46,020 --> 01:54:47,980
Someone's like, that's all I need.

3120
01:54:50,580 --> 01:54:53,620
One day is all I need for Mr. Man.

3121
01:54:54,620 --> 01:54:55,220
Um...

3122
01:54:57,240 --> 01:54:57,840
Uh...

3123
01:54:59,240 --> 01:55:00,880
Wait, give me a sec.

3124
01:55:01,620 --> 01:55:02,440
All right.

3125
01:55:02,640 --> 01:55:06,260
No, you can put yours.

3126
01:55:06,400 --> 01:55:06,940
Okay.

3127
01:55:08,340 --> 01:55:08,940
Um...

3128
01:55:08,940 --> 01:55:10,320
But anyway...

3129
01:55:10,320 --> 01:55:11,240
Uh...

3130
01:55:14,120 --> 01:55:15,880
I was like, do you want this?

3131
01:55:16,120 --> 01:55:18,380
And I was like, uh, yeah.

3132
01:55:18,560 --> 01:55:20,400
And he's like, oh, I was doing it anyway.

3133
01:55:22,260 --> 01:55:25,220
Just asked to be polite, but he already did it.

3134
01:55:26,540 --> 01:55:26,980
Um...

3135
01:55:26,980 --> 01:55:34,180
But yes, for the limited bundle, it'll be 100 for a sign, an extra bonus signed postcard.

3136
01:55:34,480 --> 01:55:36,240
And then, um...

3137
01:55:37,320 --> 01:55:37,760
Um...

3138
01:55:37,760 --> 01:55:41,340
I guess I can spoil you guys for what the Lunar New Year merch is gonna be.

3139
01:55:41,340 --> 01:55:44,200
So we're gonna have the acrylic stand.

3140
01:55:45,240 --> 01:55:45,720
Um...

3141
01:55:45,720 --> 01:55:47,600
And a...

3142
01:55:47,600 --> 01:55:48,520
Oh, okay.

3143
01:55:48,600 --> 01:55:51,360
So like, I tell you, I used to do artist alley.

3144
01:55:51,560 --> 01:55:54,080
So I actually have a button, those button makers.

3145
01:55:55,020 --> 01:55:55,500
And...

3146
01:55:55,500 --> 01:55:55,860
Woo!

3147
01:55:56,080 --> 01:55:56,820
They pay...

3148
01:55:56,820 --> 01:55:58,480
It's a lot of work.

3149
01:56:00,340 --> 01:56:03,060
I actually hand make those buttons.

3150
01:56:03,360 --> 01:56:05,580
So we're gonna have those like pin back buttons.

3151
01:56:05,900 --> 01:56:08,780
Because I actually really like hand making them because they're really fun.

3152
01:56:08,820 --> 01:56:09,840
Because they're like, boom, boom.

3153
01:56:09,920 --> 01:56:11,000
Like they're really fun to do.

3154
01:56:11,120 --> 01:56:11,320
Um...

3155
01:56:11,340 --> 01:56:13,220
But yes, it's gonna have the...

3156
01:56:13,220 --> 01:56:14,320
Those button...

3157
01:56:14,320 --> 01:56:16,740
Pin back buttons for the Lunar New Year merch.

3158
01:56:17,160 --> 01:56:18,820
And like those like little...

3159
01:56:18,820 --> 01:56:19,700
Not little, sorry.

3160
01:56:19,780 --> 01:56:20,400
Those cushions.

3161
01:56:20,400 --> 01:56:21,340
Like the...

3162
01:56:22,400 --> 01:56:22,920
Uh...

3163
01:56:22,920 --> 01:56:24,140
Those cushions and stuff.

3164
01:56:24,540 --> 01:56:25,060
Uh...

3165
01:56:25,060 --> 01:56:25,640
Like the...

3166
01:56:25,640 --> 01:56:26,080
Uh...

3167
01:56:26,080 --> 01:56:27,160
There's like gonna be a cushion.

3168
01:56:27,680 --> 01:56:29,120
And also...

3169
01:56:30,400 --> 01:56:33,020
Also, we're gonna have the red pocket envelope.

3170
01:56:33,120 --> 01:56:34,660
Which is my favorite.

3171
01:56:34,720 --> 01:56:36,260
My favorite part about all of this.

3172
01:56:36,300 --> 01:56:36,960
I'm so excited.

3173
01:56:37,120 --> 01:56:39,120
You should buy the red pocket envelope.

3174
01:56:40,280 --> 01:56:41,320
To give it to...

3175
01:56:41,320 --> 01:56:42,200
Whoever's married.

3176
01:56:42,380 --> 01:56:44,900
So they can use that to give money to you.

3177
01:56:44,980 --> 01:56:45,720
It pays itself.

3178
01:56:46,020 --> 01:56:46,340
You know?

3179
01:56:46,840 --> 01:56:47,420
Or...

3180
01:56:47,420 --> 01:56:48,380
Or...

3181
01:56:49,120 --> 01:56:55,840
Send the link to whoever is like to all your married friends, relatives, and like parents.

3182
01:56:56,160 --> 01:57:02,180
And it'd be like, I will only accept your money if you use a Doki Bird envelope.

3183
01:57:09,320 --> 01:57:11,760
You don't have to pay for the envelope.

3184
01:57:12,680 --> 01:57:13,260
And...

3185
01:57:13,260 --> 01:57:13,540
And...

3186
01:57:13,540 --> 01:57:14,440
You get the embo...

3187
01:57:14,440 --> 01:57:15,880
And you get like extra money too.

3188
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:17,140
So it's like, you know, free shit.

3189
01:57:25,050 --> 01:57:25,450
So...

3190
01:57:26,030 --> 01:57:26,590
That's it.

3191
01:57:26,610 --> 01:57:27,910
That's Lifehack.

3192
01:57:28,230 --> 01:57:31,290
But only for like anyone that celebrates Lunar New Year.

3193
01:57:31,370 --> 01:57:31,710
Lifehack.

3194
01:57:31,790 --> 01:57:32,310
Oh yes.

3195
01:57:32,470 --> 01:57:32,790
Oh yes.

3196
01:57:32,830 --> 01:57:33,530
For those who are wondering.

3197
01:57:33,630 --> 01:57:35,830
Is YouTube gonna be my main platform?

3198
01:57:36,130 --> 01:57:39,490
YouTube will be my main pla...

3199
01:57:39,490 --> 01:57:40,170
I like how this...

3200
01:57:40,170 --> 01:57:41,450
This is not even...

3201
01:57:41,450 --> 01:57:42,470
This is not infor...

3202
01:57:42,470 --> 01:57:43,830
This was not an informative stream.

3203
01:57:44,250 --> 01:57:46,710
This is not an informative stream.

3204
01:57:46,730 --> 01:57:49,470
It's like, hey, Doki's back.

3205
01:57:49,810 --> 01:57:53,470
She's gonna fucking explain a lot of stuff and then...

3206
01:57:54,670 --> 01:57:57,470
And then all that stuff, information.

3207
01:57:57,690 --> 01:58:02,210
And then here I am talking about Roblox, Worry Cats and fucking all that other shit.

3208
01:58:05,970 --> 01:58:06,930
In between.

3209
01:58:07,250 --> 01:58:12,430
It's like going through 30 minutes of ads before you get to the what you want type deal.

3210
01:58:13,110 --> 01:58:20,190
It's like, if you wanna learn more, go through the 30 minute ads of fucking Roblox, Worry Cats RP.

3211
01:58:20,630 --> 01:58:21,790
No skipping!

3212
01:58:22,470 --> 01:58:23,110
Wow!

3213
01:58:23,450 --> 01:58:25,650
Ad block doesn't work here!

3214
01:58:30,590 --> 01:58:34,610
Anyway, after I said all of that, I actually forgot what I was trying to...

3215
01:58:34,610 --> 01:58:35,470
Oh yes, main platform.

3216
01:58:35,690 --> 01:58:37,650
Main platform will be YouTube.

3217
01:58:37,910 --> 01:58:39,570
And I will also...

3218
01:58:40,590 --> 01:58:42,410
I will also...

3219
01:58:42,430 --> 01:58:44,530
Be planning on...

3220
01:58:44,530 --> 01:58:47,230
I will be planning on streaming on Twitch.

3221
01:58:47,670 --> 01:58:49,510
As well as...

3222
01:58:49,510 --> 01:58:50,470
Bilibili.

3223
01:58:51,110 --> 01:58:51,610
So...

3224
01:58:51,610 --> 01:58:54,030
But it's not gonna be like...

3225
01:58:54,030 --> 01:58:55,650
It's just like, you know, in the past.

3226
01:58:55,730 --> 01:58:57,770
It's not like a common thing being on...

3227
01:58:58,710 --> 01:59:00,170
On those two sites.

3228
01:59:00,270 --> 01:59:01,090
You know the best part?

3229
01:59:01,330 --> 01:59:02,530
Okay, I'm gonna wanna see...

3230
01:59:02,530 --> 01:59:06,110
I'm also gonna be very curious if like...

3231
01:59:06,110 --> 01:59:06,950
Because like...

3232
01:59:06,950 --> 01:59:08,470
My old Twitch account...

3233
01:59:08,470 --> 01:59:10,650
I've already hit like partner requirements.

3234
01:59:11,350 --> 01:59:11,950
And...

3235
01:59:11,950 --> 01:59:13,250
No, it's not gonna be a simulcast.

3236
01:59:13,310 --> 01:59:14,930
I don't like that.

3237
01:59:17,030 --> 01:59:18,030
I don't...

3238
01:59:18,030 --> 01:59:18,910
I personally...

3239
01:59:18,910 --> 01:59:20,990
I personally don't like...

3240
01:59:20,990 --> 01:59:21,530
Oh my god!

3241
01:59:21,650 --> 01:59:22,050
Kitto?

3242
01:59:22,390 --> 01:59:24,970
I don't even guys remember Kitto.

3243
01:59:25,810 --> 01:59:27,990
But she actually reached out...

3244
01:59:27,990 --> 01:59:30,390
And said she'd help me with...

3245
01:59:30,390 --> 01:59:32,090
With making...

3246
01:59:32,090 --> 01:59:33,570
With making an account.

3247
01:59:33,750 --> 01:59:34,190
So...

3248
01:59:35,430 --> 01:59:37,890
So I really appreciate it too.

3249
01:59:38,690 --> 01:59:40,450
But yes, anyway, what was I gonna say?

3250
01:59:41,110 --> 01:59:41,970
My Twitch!

3251
01:59:42,190 --> 01:59:43,950
I've actually hit Twitch partner...

3252
01:59:43,950 --> 01:59:45,870
Long long long ago.

3253
01:59:46,570 --> 01:59:47,090
And...

3254
01:59:47,090 --> 01:59:48,230
I never got it.

3255
01:59:48,270 --> 01:59:49,750
Because all I did was send in...

3256
01:59:49,750 --> 01:59:50,710
The B-movie script.

3257
01:59:53,650 --> 01:59:57,530
Oh Doki, maybe you stop sending the fucking B-movie script...

3258
01:59:57,530 --> 01:59:58,510
To the Twitch staff.

3259
01:59:58,670 --> 02:00:00,210
Maybe you would have got Twitch partner.

3260
02:00:01,270 --> 02:00:01,790
So...

3261
02:00:01,790 --> 02:00:02,930
I was...

3262
02:00:04,230 --> 02:00:07,210
I think I applied like three to four times or something.

3263
02:00:07,310 --> 02:00:08,350
I got rejected every time.

3264
02:00:08,810 --> 02:00:09,610
Because I...

3265
02:00:09,610 --> 02:00:12,270
All I did was just send in the B-movie script to them.

3266
02:00:15,570 --> 02:00:16,290
Repeatedly.

3267
02:00:16,290 --> 02:00:16,770
Yes.

3268
02:00:19,870 --> 02:00:20,590
Repeatedly.

3269
02:00:20,590 --> 02:00:21,870
And so...

3270
02:00:21,870 --> 02:00:23,210
Because of that...

3271
02:00:23,210 --> 02:00:26,430
They rejected me like three to four times.

3272
02:00:26,870 --> 02:00:27,590
And...

3273
02:00:27,590 --> 02:00:28,670
But!

3274
02:00:28,870 --> 02:00:31,690
I still am eligible to reapply.

3275
02:00:31,690 --> 02:00:32,910
So I was thinking...

3276
02:00:32,910 --> 02:00:33,690
Well...

3277
02:00:33,690 --> 02:00:35,990
If I do one stream on it...

3278
02:00:35,990 --> 02:00:37,910
Maybe we'll take it.

3279
02:00:43,870 --> 02:00:49,470
I don't even know how much money is missing...

3280
02:00:49,470 --> 02:00:49,770
I only have three B -movie scripts.

3281
02:00:49,910 --> 02:00:50,010
And then I have to re-release it.

3282
02:00:50,010 --> 02:00:50,330
I'm like...

3283
02:00:50,330 --> 02:00:50,450
I'm like...

3284
02:00:50,450 --> 02:00:50,630
I'm dead.

3285
02:00:50,630 --> 02:00:52,830
I don't think I'm getting more than the B-movie script.

3286
02:00:52,870 --> 02:00:53,950
But I think I'll have to wait for it.

3287
02:00:53,950 --> 02:00:53,970
Because I'm going to have to wait...

3288
02:00:54,510 --> 02:00:55,010
It's hard to get this much...

3289
02:00:56,530 --> 02:00:58,610
I need to...

3290
02:01:00,470 --> 02:01:00,530
I think it's going to be...

3291
02:01:01,050 --> 02:01:01,670
I think...

3292
02:01:04,870 --> 02:01:07,130
I think it's going to be...

3293
02:01:07,130 --> 02:01:08,010
Around...

3294
02:01:08,230 --> 02:01:08,730
It's over.

3295
02:01:09,090 --> 02:01:09,590
It's over.

3296
02:01:09,590 --> 02:01:11,730
How am I so stupid?

3297
02:01:15,090 --> 02:01:19,930
Remember when I was like, I stop looking at my bank account when I'm spending money?

3298
02:01:24,990 --> 02:01:27,070
What the fuck was wrong with me?

3299
02:01:29,530 --> 02:01:37,290
I just really... I just... I just wanna have fun with all of you guys.

3300
02:01:37,290 --> 02:01:40,310
And I always wanted to... I love doing it!

3301
02:01:43,130 --> 02:01:44,410
Okay, anyway, sorry.

3302
02:01:44,630 --> 02:01:47,350
Sorry I got into... I got way too...

3303
02:01:48,670 --> 02:01:50,290
That fucked me up.

3304
02:01:50,350 --> 02:01:50,810
I'm sorry.

3305
02:01:51,010 --> 02:01:54,530
It's like a little... It's like a trigger for me every time.

3306
02:01:55,650 --> 02:02:00,410
Every time I think about it, I... It doesn't make me angry.

3307
02:02:01,130 --> 02:02:04,370
It makes me... I... You're so fucking stupid.

3308
02:02:04,930 --> 02:02:06,070
I'm just like...

3309
02:02:07,390 --> 02:02:10,710
I was like, you didn't make any profit.

3310
02:02:10,990 --> 02:02:11,990
I was like...

3311
02:02:17,210 --> 02:02:19,810
That... That just... That fucked me up.

3312
02:02:19,910 --> 02:02:20,310
That actually...

3313
02:02:23,530 --> 02:02:27,210
That... That actually... That actually fucked me up.

3314
02:02:27,470 --> 02:02:30,090
I keep finding that out.

3315
02:02:31,350 --> 02:02:32,610
Oh my god.

3316
02:02:34,630 --> 02:02:36,870
Mr. Matt, what the fuck is the website?

3317
02:02:37,590 --> 02:02:39,430
I talked for like...

3318
02:02:40,410 --> 02:02:41,570
Two hours!

3319
02:02:44,930 --> 02:02:47,770
This has been a two hour fucking ad!

3320
02:02:49,690 --> 02:02:52,730
A two hour unskippable ad.

3321
02:02:56,350 --> 02:02:57,570
This site sucks.

3322
02:02:57,810 --> 02:03:00,710
I just bought the sub, but it won't let me buy it.

3323
02:03:00,710 --> 02:03:02,670
We don't need the... Go live!

3324
02:03:03,050 --> 02:03:04,390
We don't need the domain.

3325
02:03:06,070 --> 02:03:07,750
We'll get the domain later!

3326
02:03:11,170 --> 02:03:13,750
We can always get the domain later!

3327
02:03:15,190 --> 02:03:16,690
We'll figure it out later.

3328
02:03:17,610 --> 02:03:19,210
Anyway, cat escape.

3329
02:03:20,930 --> 02:03:22,570
Mr. Matt is doing his best.

3330
02:03:22,810 --> 02:03:23,910
Do he please understand?

3331
02:03:24,690 --> 02:03:26,010
Don't worry, he likes it.

3332
02:03:29,870 --> 02:03:31,530
If I know my chat...

3333
02:03:32,050 --> 02:03:34,550
If I know my chat...

3334
02:03:38,630 --> 02:03:39,390
It's fine.

3335
02:03:44,390 --> 02:03:46,570
Is that how... What?

3336
02:03:47,210 --> 02:03:50,490
Okay, I swear to god, if I put a poll right now...

3337
02:03:50,490 --> 02:03:51,830
And I was like...

3338
02:03:51,830 --> 02:03:53,590
Do you want me to yell at you?

3339
02:03:53,770 --> 02:03:55,710
I swear to god, like...

3340
02:03:55,710 --> 02:03:56,530
I know people be like...

3341
02:03:56,530 --> 02:03:57,450
No, don't let her win!

3342
02:03:57,690 --> 02:04:00,510
Don't let her get whatever she wants.

3343
02:04:00,650 --> 02:04:03,210
I swear to god, you guys would still vote yes.

3344
02:04:03,670 --> 02:04:04,990
Like 100%.

3345
02:04:04,990 --> 02:04:05,730
You know if I get a poll.

3346
02:04:06,590 --> 02:04:07,490
I'll be like...

3347
02:04:07,490 --> 02:04:09,330
Do you want Doki to yell at you?

3348
02:04:09,450 --> 02:04:10,250
And then...

3349
02:04:10,250 --> 02:04:11,690
You guys would be like...

3350
02:04:11,690 --> 02:04:12,230
Oh my god, yes.

3351
02:04:13,890 --> 02:04:14,910
That should be me!

3352
02:04:17,370 --> 02:04:18,850
Mr. M.

3353
02:04:20,150 --> 02:04:24,730
Do you want Doki to yell at you?

3354
02:04:26,530 --> 02:04:27,730
Alright, here we go.

3355
02:04:29,450 --> 02:04:29,910
I...

3356
02:04:30,290 --> 02:04:32,010
Like, you can't deny that.

3357
02:04:33,530 --> 02:04:34,170
True!

3358
02:04:36,350 --> 02:04:37,310
She's like...

3359
02:04:37,310 --> 02:04:38,490
I'm doing it.

3360
02:04:42,040 --> 02:04:43,520
No, I don't.

3361
02:04:43,520 --> 02:04:44,680
My ears would hurt.

3362
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:46,120
Yeah, but like...

3363
02:04:46,120 --> 02:04:46,660
It's like...

3364
02:04:50,980 --> 02:04:53,900
You know, it's like that, you know?

3365
02:04:54,680 --> 02:04:56,660
I won't say it though.

3366
02:04:56,660 --> 02:04:57,540
That's okay.

3367
02:04:57,820 --> 02:04:59,720
That's what the poll is for.

3368
02:05:00,120 --> 02:05:01,400
That's what it's for.

3369
02:05:03,420 --> 02:05:04,840
Alright, guys.

3370
02:05:05,060 --> 02:05:06,040
It's gonna be scuffed.

3371
02:05:06,400 --> 02:05:07,180
But like...

3372
02:05:07,180 --> 02:05:07,720
The store...

3373
02:05:09,020 --> 02:05:11,100
When it goes live...

3374
02:05:11,100 --> 02:05:13,460
It does not have a custom domain.

3375
02:05:13,860 --> 02:05:15,980
But I just wanted to put the store...

3376
02:05:15,980 --> 02:05:17,440
I just wanted to put the store...

3377
02:05:17,440 --> 02:05:18,480
We'll fix it later.

3378
02:05:22,300 --> 02:05:23,700
We'll fix this...

3379
02:05:23,700 --> 02:05:26,520
I had two days.

3380
02:05:30,560 --> 02:05:31,320
It's great!

3381
02:05:31,540 --> 02:05:35,280
I can always use that excuse for everything I do now.

3382
02:05:35,420 --> 02:05:37,040
I can always use that excuse.

3383
02:05:37,500 --> 02:05:39,040
I had two days.

3384
02:05:39,360 --> 02:05:39,920
So...

3385
02:05:40,680 --> 02:05:41,360
We will...

3386
02:05:42,600 --> 02:05:44,220
We will fix it in post.

3387
02:05:44,460 --> 02:05:45,460
Do not worry.

3388
02:05:46,560 --> 02:05:47,680
Do not...

3389
02:05:48,380 --> 02:05:51,820
The store is gonna go live and chat is gonna instantly...

3390
02:05:51,820 --> 02:05:52,440
Yeah, I've never...

3391
02:05:52,440 --> 02:05:52,940
Okay.

3392
02:05:53,360 --> 02:05:54,620
Honestly, like...

3393
02:05:54,620 --> 02:05:55,120
I...

3394
02:05:55,120 --> 02:05:56,420
I like...

3395
02:05:56,420 --> 02:05:58,320
Pre-ordered like...

3396
02:05:58,320 --> 02:05:59,940
50 because...

3397
02:05:59,940 --> 02:06:00,960
I don't...

3398
02:06:00,960 --> 02:06:01,780
I didn't...

3399
02:06:02,440 --> 02:06:03,020
Okay.

3400
02:06:03,360 --> 02:06:04,480
When my...

3401
02:06:04,480 --> 02:06:06,520
When my therapist was like...

3402
02:06:06,520 --> 02:06:08,220
How many people are you expecting to watch?

3403
02:06:08,540 --> 02:06:09,660
And I was just like...

3404
02:06:09,660 --> 02:06:10,180
Oh...

3405
02:06:10,180 --> 02:06:11,140
I don't know.

3406
02:06:11,180 --> 02:06:12,380
I think maybe like...

3407
02:06:12,380 --> 02:06:13,120
I don't know.

3408
02:06:13,160 --> 02:06:14,580
If it's gonna be really high...

3409
02:06:14,580 --> 02:06:15,820
It might be like 50k.

3410
02:06:16,580 --> 02:06:17,160
Like...

3411
02:06:17,160 --> 02:06:18,620
Maybe I think...

3412
02:06:18,620 --> 02:06:20,340
Because of, you know...

3413
02:06:21,040 --> 02:06:22,420
All that stuff that happened.

3414
02:06:23,780 --> 02:06:25,020
And then he's like...

3415
02:06:25,020 --> 02:06:25,280
Wow!

3416
02:06:25,920 --> 02:06:27,520
So then I was like...

3417
02:06:27,520 --> 02:06:32,280
How many people will buy merch if 50k people are gonna watch me?

3418
02:06:32,440 --> 02:06:34,500
I'll pre-order 50k.

3419
02:06:39,120 --> 02:06:41,760
In my mind, I was like...

3420
02:06:41,760 --> 02:06:42,300
Okay.

3421
02:06:42,400 --> 02:06:44,800
If 50k people are gonna watch me...

3422
02:06:44,800 --> 02:06:47,860
That means 50 people would want merch.

3423
02:06:48,480 --> 02:06:49,120
So...

3424
02:06:49,120 --> 02:06:49,200
I'm like...

3425
02:06:51,220 --> 02:06:51,880
So...

3426
02:06:51,880 --> 02:06:53,200
I already...

3427
02:06:53,200 --> 02:06:54,120
In advance...

3428
02:06:54,760 --> 02:06:57,500
Because there was like a Lunar New Year discount.

3429
02:06:59,140 --> 02:07:02,120
There was a Lunar...

3430
02:07:04,160 --> 02:07:07,660
Lunar New Year discount at this manufacturer.

3431
02:07:07,820 --> 02:07:11,320
Because like I'm handling all the manufacturing shit.

3432
02:07:11,380 --> 02:07:11,960
All that stuff.

3433
02:07:12,200 --> 02:07:13,140
And like...

3434
02:07:13,140 --> 02:07:14,180
Coordinating all that stuff.

3435
02:07:14,360 --> 02:07:14,720
So...

3436
02:07:14,720 --> 02:07:15,860
So I was like...

3437
02:07:15,860 --> 02:07:16,720
They're like...

3438
02:07:16,720 --> 02:07:17,960
Oh, how much you wanna wait?

3439
02:07:17,960 --> 02:07:18,720
And I was like...

3440
02:07:18,720 --> 02:07:19,700
50k.

3441
02:07:19,760 --> 02:07:23,020
That seems like a lot of people that will buy my merch.

3442
02:07:23,300 --> 02:07:24,500
And I was just like...

3443
02:07:24,500 --> 02:07:24,800
Yeah.

3444
02:07:25,200 --> 02:07:26,240
And now I'm like...

3445
02:07:26,240 --> 02:07:27,540
Now I'm a little worried.

3446
02:07:27,580 --> 02:07:29,260
Because now I'm like...

3447
02:07:29,260 --> 02:07:30,360
Oh no.

3448
02:07:30,700 --> 02:07:31,720
What if...

3449
02:07:32,460 --> 02:07:35,800
What if 50k is just a little bit too...

3450
02:07:35,800 --> 02:07:36,820
Too little.

3451
02:07:36,900 --> 02:07:38,500
Just a little bit under.

3452
02:07:46,780 --> 02:07:47,360
Just...

3453
02:07:47,360 --> 02:07:48,440
Oh man.

3454
02:07:48,540 --> 02:07:49,940
Maybe 50 is just...

3455
02:07:49,940 --> 02:07:50,480
You know...

3456
02:07:50,480 --> 02:07:52,180
Just a little bit under.

3457
02:07:52,560 --> 02:07:52,960
Just a little bit under.

3458
02:07:52,960 --> 02:07:53,000
So...

3459
02:07:53,000 --> 02:07:53,480
Don't worry.

3460
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:57,260
That's why it's a preorder so I can order more.

3461
02:07:58,660 --> 02:08:00,680
It's a preorder so I won't...

3462
02:08:00,680 --> 02:08:02,940
Now I know not to order in advance.

3463
02:08:03,580 --> 02:08:08,060
Because I'm just gonna go by preorders for this.

3464
02:08:08,300 --> 02:08:11,180
So like do not worry about that.

3465
02:08:11,400 --> 02:08:14,300
Because it will be going by preorders.

3466
02:08:14,520 --> 02:08:15,080
So...

3467
02:08:15,080 --> 02:08:17,340
It's not like I only have 50k.

3468
02:08:17,340 --> 02:08:18,180
50 in stock.

3469
02:08:19,640 --> 02:08:20,280
Maybe...

3470
02:08:20,280 --> 02:08:21,300
You know, I don't know.

3471
02:08:21,360 --> 02:08:22,260
Maybe I'll get 60.

3472
02:08:22,540 --> 02:08:23,040
Whoa.

3473
02:08:23,220 --> 02:08:24,820
That would be fucking insane.

3474
02:08:25,080 --> 02:08:26,160
Holy shit.

3475
02:08:26,220 --> 02:08:28,660
Maybe 60 people will buy my merch.

3476
02:08:35,220 --> 02:08:35,860
But...

3477
02:08:35,860 --> 02:08:36,520
Don't worry.

3478
02:08:36,580 --> 02:08:40,120
It's uncapped except for the limited edition bundle.

3479
02:08:40,260 --> 02:08:42,720
Where the signed postcards.

3480
02:08:42,840 --> 02:08:46,600
That is capped to a hundred.

3481
02:08:47,520 --> 02:08:47,960
Because...

3482
02:08:48,380 --> 02:08:49,540
A hundred is the limit.

3483
02:08:49,640 --> 02:08:50,240
I will...

3484
02:08:51,820 --> 02:08:52,260
Sign...

3485
02:08:53,560 --> 02:08:54,440
A postcard.

3486
02:08:55,640 --> 02:08:56,080
Um...

3487
02:08:56,740 --> 02:08:57,180
Because...

3488
02:08:57,780 --> 02:08:58,860
That is a lot of postcards.

3489
02:08:59,960 --> 02:09:00,800
That is...

3490
02:09:02,040 --> 02:09:04,040
That is just, you know, a little...

3491
02:09:04,040 --> 02:09:04,680
That's a lot.

3492
02:09:04,940 --> 02:09:06,200
That's just so a lot.

3493
02:09:06,280 --> 02:09:08,060
And I really... I don't really want to get...

3494
02:09:08,060 --> 02:09:09,820
Oh, what's it called when you fuck up your wrists?

3495
02:09:10,320 --> 02:09:10,960
Carpal tunnel?

3496
02:09:11,200 --> 02:09:12,580
Yeah, I really don't want to get carpal tunnel.

3497
02:09:12,740 --> 02:09:15,140
Because, you know, I play FPS shooters.

3498
02:09:15,400 --> 02:09:16,860
And like, carpal tunnel is...

3499
02:09:16,860 --> 02:09:19,580
Where FPS players die.

3500
02:09:19,940 --> 02:09:20,460
So...

3501
02:09:21,640 --> 02:09:22,520
If I...

3502
02:09:22,520 --> 02:09:23,680
Oh, I shouldn't say that.

3503
02:09:25,200 --> 02:09:25,720
No!

3504
02:09:26,260 --> 02:09:27,640
Wait, no, I shouldn't.

3505
02:09:27,640 --> 02:09:28,880
That's... I shouldn't.

3506
02:09:33,860 --> 02:09:35,640
I go to therapy now.

3507
02:09:35,780 --> 02:09:36,320
I'm okay.

3508
02:09:36,620 --> 02:09:37,440
I couldn't...

3509
02:09:38,280 --> 02:09:40,320
You know, sometimes you gotta be able to laugh.

3510
02:09:40,560 --> 02:09:42,300
Sometimes you gotta be able to laugh.

3511
02:09:42,660 --> 02:09:43,540
Oh my god.

3512
02:09:44,660 --> 02:09:45,180
Okay.

3513
02:09:45,360 --> 02:09:45,880
Anyway.

3514
02:09:46,320 --> 02:09:46,840
Um...

3515
02:09:47,780 --> 02:09:48,300
Um...

3516
02:09:49,420 --> 02:09:49,940
Uh...

3517
02:09:50,740 --> 02:09:52,280
Mr. Matt, what the fuck?

3518
02:09:53,580 --> 02:09:54,100
Where?

3519
02:09:58,180 --> 02:09:59,900
We're not Freebirds!

3520
02:10:00,240 --> 02:10:01,260
I swear...

3521
02:10:01,260 --> 02:10:03,060
We can come up with better names!

3522
02:10:04,140 --> 02:10:05,460
Freebirds is a fucking...

3523
02:10:05,460 --> 02:10:06,580
Okay, I'm gonna say it.

3524
02:10:06,720 --> 02:10:07,760
It's a good song.

3525
02:10:08,260 --> 02:10:09,200
But it's...

3526
02:10:09,600 --> 02:10:12,400
You can make it your fucking national anthem if you want.

3527
02:10:12,560 --> 02:10:14,960
But we're not gonna be called Freebirds.

3528
02:10:15,300 --> 02:10:15,820
Because...

3529
02:10:16,300 --> 02:10:16,560
Look.

3530
02:10:16,560 --> 02:10:19,020
I've been in this game for a while now.

3531
02:10:19,300 --> 02:10:19,620
Okay?

3532
02:10:20,160 --> 02:10:23,920
Like, we've came up with a solid name.

3533
02:10:24,220 --> 02:10:24,520
Okay?

3534
02:10:24,920 --> 02:10:26,040
Last time.

3535
02:10:26,460 --> 02:10:28,080
We can do it again.

3536
02:10:29,420 --> 02:10:32,620
I know what makes a good name.

3537
02:10:33,340 --> 02:10:35,760
But like, Freebirds is not a good...

3538
02:10:35,760 --> 02:10:36,360
Free...

3539
02:10:36,360 --> 02:10:38,380
Like, it's not a good fan mascot name.

3540
02:10:38,560 --> 02:10:39,760
We can do better!

3541
02:10:40,720 --> 02:10:42,040
I know we can!

3542
02:10:42,720 --> 02:10:43,640
I know.

3543
02:10:43,900 --> 02:10:45,140
You just...

3544
02:10:45,140 --> 02:10:46,360
Do you see a...

3545
02:10:46,360 --> 02:10:48,200
A bot that says like, three to four years?

3546
02:10:48,320 --> 02:10:49,700
Like, what the fuck do you mean?

3547
02:10:53,100 --> 02:10:55,700
I wanna be the Doki Prokis.

3548
02:10:55,800 --> 02:10:56,480
You know what the...

3549
02:10:57,360 --> 02:10:58,380
What the fuck?

3550
02:10:59,760 --> 02:11:01,660
We had two days.

3551
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:05,440
Alright.

3552
02:11:05,660 --> 02:11:06,920
We're not gonna be Freebirds!

3553
02:11:07,460 --> 02:11:09,640
I swear to fucking god, we're not...

3554
02:11:10,120 --> 02:11:11,120
Wait, no, that's not...

3555
02:11:11,120 --> 02:11:12,180
No, I was gonna say Chirpians.

3556
02:11:12,260 --> 02:11:12,640
There's...

3557
02:11:12,640 --> 02:11:13,580
It's pretty clever.

3558
02:11:13,720 --> 02:11:14,780
But like, it's...

3559
02:11:14,780 --> 02:11:15,480
It's...

3560
02:11:15,480 --> 02:11:16,360
It's not as pretty.

3561
02:11:16,440 --> 02:11:16,560
No.

3562
02:11:16,660 --> 02:11:18,320
If you say it out loud...

3563
02:11:19,340 --> 02:11:22,540
If you say it out loud, it's not the best...

3564
02:11:22,540 --> 02:11:24,200
The best name.

3565
02:11:24,420 --> 02:11:26,120
It's cool to read it.

3566
02:11:26,500 --> 02:11:27,560
It's cool to read it.

3567
02:11:29,680 --> 02:11:31,060
The Bird Brigade.

3568
02:11:31,500 --> 02:11:32,540
Oh, look at that!

3569
02:11:32,620 --> 02:11:33,840
Do you want Doki to yell at you?

3570
02:11:34,040 --> 02:11:34,440
Yes.

3571
02:11:34,460 --> 02:11:35,640
83% yes.

3572
02:11:35,780 --> 02:11:39,460
And then people who are saying no are those who are fucking in denial.

3573
02:11:40,400 --> 02:11:41,340
Alright, that's cool.

3574
02:11:41,440 --> 02:11:42,140
I told you guys.

3575
02:11:42,300 --> 02:11:43,620
I know you guys are fucking freaks.

3576
02:11:48,640 --> 02:11:49,200
You're my freak.

3577
02:11:49,200 --> 02:11:49,220
But...

3578
02:11:49,220 --> 02:11:50,520
You're my freak.

3579
02:11:54,660 --> 02:11:56,760
Alright, do it for f- Oh shit, it's live.

3580
02:11:56,980 --> 02:11:58,480
What the fuck is the URL?

3581
02:11:58,680 --> 02:11:58,960
Okay.

3582
02:11:59,060 --> 02:11:59,940
That's on me.

3583
02:12:00,720 --> 02:12:02,140
That's on me.

3584
02:12:04,120 --> 02:12:05,560
Alright, so you guys know.

3585
02:12:05,780 --> 02:12:07,300
It says opening soon.

3586
02:12:07,640 --> 02:12:08,200
What...

3587
02:12:10,720 --> 02:12:11,280
Okay.

3588
02:12:12,620 --> 02:12:13,180
Alright.

3589
02:12:14,020 --> 02:12:14,520
So, you guys know.

3590
02:12:14,520 --> 02:12:14,740
Okay.

3591
02:12:14,980 --> 02:12:15,460
Guys.

3592
02:12:15,460 --> 02:12:15,820
Guys!

3593
02:12:19,640 --> 02:12:28,940
Okay, when you see the URL It's like the theme of this entire... my journey here today.

3594
02:12:29,220 --> 02:12:32,480
It's actually this fucking theme.

3595
02:12:34,190 --> 02:12:36,440
This theme of my very first stream.

3596
02:12:36,500 --> 02:12:37,200
Okay, let me say...

3597
02:12:38,190 --> 02:12:39,320
Opening soon?

3598
02:12:39,940 --> 02:12:41,400
Question mark!

3599
02:12:43,440 --> 02:12:46,160
Sorry, I had to shimmy to the left again.

3600
02:12:48,240 --> 02:12:51,240
Okay, let me refresh and see if that helps.

3601
02:12:52,420 --> 02:12:59,140
But when you see the URL of this store, it is...

3602
02:13:00,660 --> 02:13:03,900
You will understand where we're at in life.

3603
02:13:04,120 --> 02:13:07,300
You know, I feel it just fits where I'm at in life right now.

3604
02:13:07,440 --> 02:13:10,760
Like, how I've been feeling the past month.

3605
02:13:11,820 --> 02:13:13,800
Honestly, it's it's like we're there.

3606
02:13:14,080 --> 02:13:15,060
We're there.

3607
02:13:15,680 --> 02:13:17,920
We made it.

3608
02:13:18,560 --> 02:13:22,100
We're existing.

3609
02:13:22,860 --> 02:13:26,140
It's... it's happening.

3610
02:13:30,340 --> 02:13:32,340
Why does it say opening soon?

3611
02:13:34,800 --> 02:13:39,340
I like how it wrote opening soon and then silence.

3612
02:13:39,700 --> 02:13:40,040
Silence.

3613
02:13:40,520 --> 02:13:40,780
Silence.

3614
02:13:44,640 --> 02:13:45,780
Alright, give me a sec.

3615
02:13:47,740 --> 02:13:49,820
Why is it called Dokieworks.

3616
02:13:51,320 --> 02:13:54,620
Oh, cause we don't have... we don't have our own domain.

3617
02:13:56,540 --> 02:13:57,020
Dokiemons?

3618
02:13:57,020 --> 02:13:57,320
chu?

3619
02:14:00,600 --> 02:14:01,080
Go.

3620
02:14:01,120 --> 02:14:01,360
Go!

3621
02:14:01,500 --> 02:14:02,700
Do... vibes.

3622
02:14:07,820 --> 02:14:08,300
Doki mayo.

3623
02:14:08,300 --> 02:14:08,700
Dokiemoins!

3624
02:14:09,500 --> 02:14:09,980
No!

3625
02:14:10,100 --> 02:14:11,380
Because I don't want you guys to be called Dokie.

3626
02:14:11,400 --> 02:14:15,680
I thought about it, but like... no!

3627
02:14:15,960 --> 02:14:16,760
No no no no no!

3628
02:14:17,060 --> 02:14:18,940
I literally renamed my dog!

3629
02:14:24,910 --> 02:14:27,290
I literally gave him a nickname!

3630
02:14:28,090 --> 02:14:30,650
You're not taking Doki from me!

3631
02:14:31,030 --> 02:14:31,630
Alright?

3632
02:14:31,930 --> 02:14:38,330
I renamed him to Doki Amber Doge.

3633
02:14:38,350 --> 02:14:42,650
So like, you're not taking Doki from me.

3634
02:14:43,630 --> 02:14:45,270
Yeah, I gave him Dad.

3635
02:14:46,050 --> 02:14:46,890
Chirp Knights.

3636
02:14:47,250 --> 02:14:48,050
Oh my god.

3637
02:14:48,770 --> 02:14:49,630
Chirp Knights.

3638
02:14:52,410 --> 02:14:53,550
Come here Chirp Knight.

3639
02:14:53,610 --> 02:14:53,790
No.

3640
02:14:53,970 --> 02:14:55,150
I can't say that.

3641
02:14:55,450 --> 02:14:56,410
Chirp Knights.

3642
02:14:56,690 --> 02:14:57,930
No, it just doesn't...

3643
02:14:57,930 --> 02:14:59,170
It's so hard!

3644
02:14:59,290 --> 02:15:02,030
It's so hard finding like, the perfect name.

3645
02:15:03,130 --> 02:15:04,650
It really is.

3646
02:15:04,830 --> 02:15:05,390
Wingman.

3647
02:15:05,670 --> 02:15:07,330
Yeah, but then like Tricking!

3648
02:15:07,670 --> 02:15:08,450
Then you'd be...

3649
02:15:08,450 --> 02:15:09,870
It's like...

3650
02:15:10,590 --> 02:15:11,870
I don't wanna fucking...

3651
02:15:12,650 --> 02:15:14,090
I don't wanna draw...

3652
02:15:14,090 --> 02:15:15,510
a grown ass man.

3653
02:15:16,170 --> 02:15:16,710
Hahahaha!

3654
02:15:18,590 --> 02:15:19,470
Hahahaha!

3655
02:15:20,930 --> 02:15:21,810
Hahahaha!

3656
02:15:22,910 --> 02:15:27,890
It's just like the most detailed, like, macho man out there.

3657
02:15:28,430 --> 02:15:29,790
Cause like, that's what I...

3658
02:15:29,790 --> 02:15:30,370
Hahahaha!

3659
02:15:32,550 --> 02:15:33,430
Uh...

3660
02:15:34,410 --> 02:15:35,890
Let's see...

3661
02:15:36,230 --> 02:15:37,870
The back seaters.

3662
02:15:38,270 --> 02:15:39,370
Bro, who said...

3663
02:15:39,370 --> 02:15:40,230
Hahahaha!

3664
02:15:42,650 --> 02:15:44,210
No, Wing... Yeah, I'm not...

3665
02:15:44,210 --> 02:15:45,710
You guys are not gonna be...

3666
02:15:45,710 --> 02:15:47,170
Get the mascot!

3667
02:15:47,490 --> 02:15:48,170
Man!

3668
02:15:49,330 --> 02:15:52,610
The mascot will just be one man, please.

3669
02:15:53,410 --> 02:15:54,910
Man standing still.

3670
02:15:57,870 --> 02:15:58,550
Welcome...

3671
02:15:58,550 --> 02:16:00,230
No, we're not doing Freebirds!

3672
02:16:01,070 --> 02:16:02,390
Hello, Freebirds.

3673
02:16:02,710 --> 02:16:04,410
No, it's so stupid!

3674
02:16:04,870 --> 02:16:05,210
Hahahaha!

3675
02:16:07,810 --> 02:16:08,490
Birdseed...

3676
02:16:08,490 --> 02:16:09,730
Oh my god.

3677
02:16:10,330 --> 02:16:11,870
Why are your names so hard?

3678
02:16:13,370 --> 02:16:14,570
This is like...

3679
02:16:14,570 --> 02:16:16,650
my third time doing this.

3680
02:16:16,810 --> 02:16:17,330
Why?

3681
02:16:17,630 --> 02:16:18,630
I should be...

3682
02:16:18,630 --> 02:16:20,430
Oh, I should be better at...

3683
02:16:20,430 --> 02:16:21,530
There's more of you now!

3684
02:16:22,630 --> 02:16:23,870
There's more of you!

3685
02:16:23,990 --> 02:16:25,910
Surely there should be more ideas!

3686
02:16:26,290 --> 02:16:28,610
That's how fucking group work works!

3687
02:16:29,150 --> 02:16:32,050
Oh no, actually, group works is the more there is, there's...

3688
02:16:32,050 --> 02:16:36,670
The more people there are, the more people that's just gonna make one person do all the work.

3689
02:16:37,450 --> 02:16:37,970
Uh...

3690
02:16:38,690 --> 02:16:40,470
You're not gonna be little tomatoes.

3691
02:16:40,670 --> 02:16:41,170
What the fuck?

3692
02:16:41,190 --> 02:16:42,630
I'm gonna just squish you.

3693
02:16:43,270 --> 02:16:43,910
Um...

3694
02:16:45,650 --> 02:16:46,290
Free...

3695
02:16:46,290 --> 02:16:46,890
...

3696
02:16:46,890 --> 02:16:47,170
...

3697
02:16:50,810 --> 02:16:51,450
No.

3698
02:16:54,610 --> 02:16:55,890
Because apparently...

3699
02:16:56,770 --> 02:17:00,550
Zoomers ruined the word goons now, so...

3700
02:17:00,550 --> 02:17:00,810
...

3701
02:17:02,410 --> 02:17:03,530
What was it?

3702
02:17:03,530 --> 02:17:04,990
Yeah, I heard that...

3703
02:17:04,990 --> 02:17:06,890
I saw like people started...

3704
02:17:06,890 --> 02:17:08,530
Zoomers did some... Not Zoomers.

3705
02:17:08,610 --> 02:17:09,010
What was it?

3706
02:17:09,890 --> 02:17:10,490
Um...

3707
02:17:10,490 --> 02:17:12,230
What are the ones after Zoomers now?

3708
02:17:13,830 --> 02:17:14,690
What are they?

3709
02:17:14,990 --> 02:17:15,590
Z?

3710
02:17:16,950 --> 02:17:18,670
Wait... Who... What... I mean...

3711
02:17:18,670 --> 02:17:21,090
Sorry, Zoomers... Who... Who... What's after?

3712
02:17:22,150 --> 02:17:23,210
What's after Zoomers?

3713
02:17:23,670 --> 02:17:25,210
Already... It's been a while.

3714
02:17:25,490 --> 02:17:25,890
...

3715
02:17:27,010 --> 02:17:27,930
Gen Alpha?

3716
02:17:28,250 --> 02:17:33,190
I heard Gen Alpha ruined... Gen Alpha ruined goons, so...

3717
02:17:33,190 --> 02:17:34,870
We cannot have...

3718
02:17:34,870 --> 02:17:36,590
We cannot have that in there anymore.

3719
02:17:36,830 --> 02:17:38,630
We cannot have that.

3720
02:17:39,990 --> 02:17:40,830
Anymore.

3721
02:17:46,900 --> 02:17:47,320
Alright.

3722
02:17:48,180 --> 02:17:49,960
Mr. Man, I swear.

3723
02:17:50,140 --> 02:17:56,960
Mr. Man is having the fucking hardest time opening up the store.

3724
02:17:57,620 --> 02:17:58,400
...

3725
02:17:59,060 --> 02:17:59,940
...

3726
02:18:01,660 --> 02:18:02,500
...

3727
02:18:02,500 --> 02:18:04,240
He's like...

3728
02:18:05,060 --> 02:18:07,300
He's like, why is it so hard?

3729
02:18:07,740 --> 02:18:09,500
No, it says opening soon!

3730
02:18:09,740 --> 02:18:10,340
...

3731
02:18:15,460 --> 02:18:16,660
He's like...

3732
02:18:16,660 --> 02:18:19,060
Okay, so what's going on is that...

3733
02:18:20,980 --> 02:18:23,220
What's going on is that...

3734
02:18:23,220 --> 02:18:25,060
We solve one problem...

3735
02:18:25,600 --> 02:18:26,760
And then...

3736
02:18:26,760 --> 02:18:29,120
It leads to another problem...

3737
02:18:29,120 --> 02:18:33,280
And then we solve that problem... And then it goes...

3738
02:18:33,280 --> 02:18:35,060
... to another problem...

3739
02:18:35,900 --> 02:18:36,080
...

3740
02:18:37,920 --> 02:18:38,640
...

3741
02:18:38,640 --> 02:18:40,200
He's just like, why?

3742
02:18:40,200 --> 02:18:40,540
Why?

3743
02:18:40,900 --> 02:18:42,480
It's still opening soon!

3744
02:18:42,940 --> 02:18:44,760
What do you want from me?

3745
02:18:45,960 --> 02:18:47,100
Bird Knights?

3746
02:18:47,420 --> 02:18:49,760
Okay, I actually thought about Bird Knights...

3747
02:18:49,760 --> 02:18:50,960
But like, it's...

3748
02:18:51,780 --> 02:18:53,940
Not a great name when you say it.

3749
02:18:54,160 --> 02:18:54,600
...

3750
02:18:54,600 --> 02:18:57,820
When you say it out loud.

3751
02:18:57,960 --> 02:18:58,520
Bird Knights.

3752
02:18:58,880 --> 02:19:01,240
Because like, you can't say Bird Knights very...

3753
02:19:01,240 --> 02:19:03,920
Like, if you say Bird Knights very fast...

3754
02:19:03,920 --> 02:19:05,060
It's like...

3755
02:19:05,060 --> 02:19:07,880
It sounds... That's what I'm saying!

3756
02:19:07,880 --> 02:19:09,580
Getting the perfect name...

3757
02:19:09,580 --> 02:19:10,980
Is like...

3758
02:19:10,980 --> 02:19:12,920
Who the fuck said...

3759
02:19:13,740 --> 02:19:14,380
Nesticle?

3760
02:19:14,620 --> 02:19:15,960
What the fuck are you?

3761
02:19:16,100 --> 02:19:17,880
I don't have members, so now it's...

3762
02:19:17,880 --> 02:19:18,960
... harder to find people.

3763
02:19:20,420 --> 02:19:21,640
Now it... Hooters.

3764
02:19:23,300 --> 02:19:24,520
My Hooters.

3765
02:19:24,660 --> 02:19:25,880
My Hooters.

3766
02:19:27,040 --> 02:19:27,320
Fuck!

3767
02:19:27,520 --> 02:19:27,760
No!

3768
02:19:27,940 --> 02:19:28,500
Wait, no!

3769
02:19:28,900 --> 02:19:30,180
No, don't be tempted.

3770
02:19:30,560 --> 02:19:31,680
No, sorry.

3771
02:19:32,020 --> 02:19:33,540
That actually... That's...

3772
02:19:33,540 --> 02:19:33,960
...

3773
02:19:37,720 --> 02:19:40,100
Welcome to the... Welcome to the...

3774
02:19:40,120 --> 02:19:40,780
Welcome Hooters.

3775
02:19:41,740 --> 02:19:42,340
No.

3776
02:19:42,480 --> 02:19:43,560
No, we shouldn't be.

3777
02:19:43,720 --> 02:19:44,280
I can't.

3778
02:19:44,280 --> 02:19:45,740
It's funny, but... It's...

3779
02:19:45,740 --> 02:19:48,380
It's funny, but we can't be Hooters, guys.

3780
02:19:49,080 --> 02:19:50,200
As much as...

3781
02:19:50,200 --> 02:19:52,180
... we can have transformative work now...

3782
02:19:52,180 --> 02:19:53,620
... we cannot be Hooters.

3783
02:19:53,620 --> 02:19:54,080
That...

3784
02:19:54,080 --> 02:19:55,460
That would...

3785
02:19:55,980 --> 02:19:58,320
... not be ideal...

3786
02:19:58,320 --> 02:19:59,540
... for...

3787
02:19:59,540 --> 02:20:00,440
... for...

3788
02:20:00,440 --> 02:20:03,500
... Deagles...

3789
02:20:03,500 --> 02:20:05,440
... is good because of the...

3790
02:20:05,440 --> 02:20:05,760
...

3791
02:20:05,760 --> 02:20:08,320
... Doki Bark?

3792
02:20:08,660 --> 02:20:09,420
Oh my god!

3793
02:20:09,480 --> 02:20:09,960
I would...

3794
02:20:10,120 --> 02:20:11,400
... Okay, I was so fucking...

3795
02:20:11,400 --> 02:20:14,200
... I would say I was very clever, but like...

3796
02:20:14,200 --> 02:20:15,960
... I would... Okay, so like...

3797
02:20:15,960 --> 02:20:17,600
... So, my Twitch...

3798
02:20:18,180 --> 02:20:19,720
... tag, like the...

3799
02:20:19,720 --> 02:20:22,020
... the emote, like... stuff...

3800
02:20:22,020 --> 02:20:23,560
... you have... It's like Doki Bee.

3801
02:20:23,840 --> 02:20:26,120
So then, I had like... I would actually...

3802
02:20:26,120 --> 02:20:27,660
... make real words out of it, like...

3803
02:20:27,660 --> 02:20:28,380
... Doki Bark.

3804
02:20:29,040 --> 02:20:29,980
Doki Bang.

3805
02:20:30,200 --> 02:20:31,840
... Which is like Doki with a gun.

3806
02:20:32,120 --> 02:20:33,280
... Doki Bread.

3807
02:20:33,740 --> 02:20:34,180
...

3808
02:20:34,800 --> 02:20:35,240
...

3809
02:20:35,240 --> 02:20:35,420
...

3810
02:20:35,420 --> 02:20:40,960
... I would have like real...

3811
02:20:40,960 --> 02:20:42,680
... I would just make real words out of my...

3812
02:20:42,680 --> 02:20:45,360
... emote, like... emote names and stuff.

3813
02:20:45,660 --> 02:20:47,100
... I love Doki Bang.

3814
02:20:47,300 --> 02:20:48,880
... Doki Bang is like one of my...

3815
02:20:48,880 --> 02:20:51,260
... Also like... Okay, we're gonna have...

3816
02:20:51,260 --> 02:20:53,080
... real emotes, but back then...

3817
02:20:53,080 --> 02:20:54,840
... I just... Back then...

3818
02:20:54,840 --> 02:20:57,300
... All I did was just... I took a picture...

3819
02:20:57,300 --> 02:20:59,240
... of my dog, and then I just drew...

3820
02:20:59,240 --> 02:21:00,480
... expressions on...

3821
02:21:00,480 --> 02:21:00,740
...

3822
02:21:00,740 --> 02:21:01,320
...

3823
02:21:02,220 --> 02:21:02,700
...

3824
02:21:04,880 --> 02:21:05,360
...

3825
02:21:06,540 --> 02:21:07,020
...

3826
02:21:07,020 --> 02:21:09,600
... I was a very low effort streamer.

3827
02:21:09,680 --> 02:21:12,280
... Oh my god, I was very...

3828
02:21:12,280 --> 02:21:12,840
...

3829
02:21:12,840 --> 02:21:16,020
... I took a picture of my dog...

3830
02:21:16,020 --> 02:21:18,380
... and then I just drew like expressions...

3831
02:21:18,380 --> 02:21:20,280
... on top of it, and like...

3832
02:21:20,280 --> 02:21:22,040
... Photoshop like items on...

3833
02:21:22,040 --> 02:21:24,000
... the emote.

3834
02:21:24,080 --> 02:21:26,440
... And then my sub badges was just...

3835
02:21:26,440 --> 02:21:28,720
... me drawing the sub badges in Emma's...

3836
02:21:28,720 --> 02:21:28,920
... Paint.

3837
02:21:29,260 --> 02:21:30,480
And then I just...

3838
02:21:30,740 --> 02:21:32,820
... snip... I just crop...

3839
02:21:32,820 --> 02:21:34,760
... crop it, and then I just...

3840
02:21:34,760 --> 02:21:35,360
... upload it.

3841
02:21:35,440 --> 02:21:36,600
And then sometimes you can see my...

3842
02:21:36,600 --> 02:21:38,500
... cursor on the sub badge.

3843
02:21:38,660 --> 02:21:40,980
... And the sub badges would be like the default sub badges...

3844
02:21:40,980 --> 02:21:42,640
... but like Emma's Paint.

3845
02:21:43,300 --> 02:21:44,780
... And then...

3846
02:21:44,780 --> 02:21:46,480
... That's why...

3847
02:21:46,480 --> 02:21:48,620
... I never thought I would get...

3848
02:21:48,620 --> 02:21:50,220
... this many people to watch me...

3849
02:21:50,220 --> 02:21:52,400
... because holy fuck...

3850
02:21:52,400 --> 02:21:53,760
... I was so lazy.

3851
02:21:54,020 --> 02:21:56,280
... I was so lazy.

3852
02:21:56,740 --> 02:21:57,140
...

3853
02:21:57,140 --> 02:22:00,940
... Holy fuck...

3854
02:22:00,940 --> 02:22:01,320
... I...

3855
02:22:01,320 --> 02:22:05,000
... I was... I did not care.

3856
02:22:05,280 --> 02:22:06,120
... I didn't...

3857
02:22:06,120 --> 02:22:08,600
... I just... all I cared was...

3858
02:22:08,600 --> 02:22:11,180
... to talk to... I just wanted to talk to people.

3859
02:22:11,340 --> 02:22:12,940
... That's all I cared.

3860
02:22:13,140 --> 02:22:14,740
... This is why...

3861
02:22:14,740 --> 02:22:16,820
... I never got Twitch Partner for...

3862
02:22:16,820 --> 02:22:19,040
... fucking five... four times...

3863
02:22:19,040 --> 02:22:21,120
... after applying for four... three or...

3864
02:22:21,120 --> 02:22:23,300
... four times... this is why I never...

3865
02:22:23,300 --> 02:22:24,100
... got Twitch Partner.

3866
02:22:24,180 --> 02:22:24,660
...

3867
02:22:27,140 --> 02:22:28,780
... We're not nesticles!

3868
02:22:28,980 --> 02:22:30,080
... Jesus Christ!

3869
02:22:30,540 --> 02:22:32,860
... We're not gonna be...

3870
02:22:32,860 --> 02:22:33,600
... nesticles.

3871
02:22:34,100 --> 02:22:35,140
Alright, we're gonna...

3872
02:22:35,140 --> 02:22:37,220
... we're gonna shimmy to the... I'll fix...

3873
02:22:37,220 --> 02:22:37,640
... this later.

3874
02:22:38,020 --> 02:22:39,140
I'm gonna shimmy...

3875
02:22:39,140 --> 02:22:40,660
... to the left a little bit.

3876
02:22:41,380 --> 02:22:42,000
... You know what?

3877
02:22:42,060 --> 02:22:42,440
Fuck this.

3878
02:22:42,480 --> 02:22:43,040
Mr. Mad...

3879
02:22:43,040 --> 02:22:44,520
... How long do you think it's gonna take?

3880
02:22:44,740 --> 02:22:47,180
... How long... do you...

3881
02:22:47,180 --> 02:22:48,920
... think it's... This has been a...

3882
02:22:48,920 --> 02:22:50,240
... two hour plus ad.

3883
02:22:50,520 --> 02:22:51,020
...

3884
02:22:51,020 --> 02:22:51,780
...

3885
02:22:57,050 --> 02:22:58,590
... This has been a...

3886
02:22:58,890 --> 02:23:00,870
... two hour plus ad...

3887
02:23:00,870 --> 02:23:02,510
... that was unskippable...

3888
02:23:02,510 --> 02:23:04,670
... for 90,000 people.

3889
02:23:06,710 --> 02:23:07,430
...

3890
02:23:07,430 --> 02:23:10,310
... It's been 80...

3891
02:23:10,310 --> 02:23:11,710
... hooligans?

3892
02:23:12,050 --> 02:23:14,970
... No, wait...

3893
02:23:14,970 --> 02:23:16,230
... I feel like someone's hooligan...

3894
02:23:16,230 --> 02:23:17,310
... No, not that...

3895
02:23:17,310 --> 02:23:18,710
... Wing...

3896
02:23:18,710 --> 02:23:22,010
... Aviators...

3897
02:23:22,010 --> 02:23:22,870
...

3898
02:23:22,870 --> 02:23:26,330
... Best ad ever...

3899
02:23:26,330 --> 02:23:28,130
... Nightingale... OH MY GOD!

3900
02:23:28,170 --> 02:23:28,730
NIGHTINGALE!

3901
02:23:28,890 --> 02:23:29,970
... Oh, there's so many syllables.

3902
02:23:30,490 --> 02:23:31,090
Nightingales...

3903
02:23:31,090 --> 02:23:33,250
... Nightingales... Hello, my nightingale...

3904
02:23:33,250 --> 02:23:34,910
... Nah, sorry, that's way too...

3905
02:23:34,910 --> 02:23:36,870
... Uhhhh...

3906
02:23:36,870 --> 02:23:37,230
...

3907
02:23:37,230 --> 02:23:41,150
... At this point, I don't know...

3908
02:23:41,150 --> 02:23:42,990
... I think there's some info that might...

3909
02:23:42,990 --> 02:23:44,550
... take time to...

3910
02:23:44,550 --> 02:23:45,490
... process...

3911
02:23:45,490 --> 02:23:46,890
... What?

3912
02:23:47,230 --> 02:23:47,770
...

3913
02:23:50,580 --> 02:23:55,080
... Wait!

3914
02:23:56,980 --> 02:23:58,100
... Why can't we...

3915
02:23:58,100 --> 02:24:00,380
... Why can't we not have a domain?

3916
02:24:00,380 --> 02:24:02,400
... Okay, why...

3917
02:24:02,400 --> 02:24:04,280
... Why do we...

3918
02:24:04,280 --> 02:24:05,720
... need a domain?

3919
02:24:06,180 --> 02:24:07,480
... Just go and...

3920
02:24:07,480 --> 02:24:07,940
...

3921
02:24:07,940 --> 02:24:09,140
...

3922
02:24:12,000 --> 02:24:12,460
...

3923
02:24:14,360 --> 02:24:15,280
...

3924
02:24:15,280 --> 02:24:15,600
...

3925
02:24:15,600 --> 02:24:21,720
... He's like...

3926
02:24:21,720 --> 02:24:23,900
... Because the thing won't update...

3927
02:24:23,900 --> 02:24:25,720
... in my billing info...

3928
02:24:25,720 --> 02:24:26,180
...

3929
02:24:26,180 --> 02:24:29,840
... Okay, guys... guys...

3930
02:24:30,380 --> 02:24:31,980
... Most likely the shop might not go...

3931
02:24:31,980 --> 02:24:34,220
... The shop might not go live today...

3932
02:24:34,220 --> 02:24:35,020
... Apparently...

3933
02:24:35,020 --> 02:24:37,080
... Because we're in...

3934
02:24:37,080 --> 02:24:40,080
... It's been rough...

3935
02:24:40,080 --> 02:24:42,540
... But I'll show you guys the fucking...

3936
02:24:42,540 --> 02:24:43,900
... URL...

3937
02:24:43,900 --> 02:24:45,960
... Because it's so fucking...

3938
02:24:45,960 --> 02:24:47,740
... It's so funny...

3939
02:24:47,740 --> 02:24:50,660
... I saw the URL and I was just like...

3940
02:24:50,660 --> 02:24:51,480
... What the fuck?

3941
02:24:51,980 --> 02:24:54,520
... Oh my god...

3942
02:24:54,520 --> 02:24:55,660
... Look at this...

3943
02:24:55,660 --> 02:24:57,260
... Look at this URL...

3944
02:24:57,260 --> 02:24:59,160
... Look at this URL...

3945
02:25:00,380 --> 02:25:02,560
... It doesn't show up...

3946
02:25:02,560 --> 02:25:04,680
... The header doesn't show up...

3947
02:25:04,680 --> 02:25:06,140
... Because it's not...

3948
02:25:06,140 --> 02:25:06,960
... Live...

3949
02:25:06,960 --> 02:25:09,580
... He's like...

3950
02:25:09,580 --> 02:25:10,700
... He's like...

3951
02:25:10,700 --> 02:25:13,900
... Can you please show your chat...

3952
02:25:13,900 --> 02:25:16,680
... The header that I worked so hard on...

3953
02:25:16,680 --> 02:25:18,940
... And I can't see it...

3954
02:25:18,940 --> 02:25:20,100
... Because...

3955
02:25:20,100 --> 02:25:21,020
... Okay...

3956
02:25:21,020 --> 02:25:23,400
... They will see it when the shop...

3957
02:25:23,400 --> 02:25:24,700
... Look, he's watching my stream...

3958
02:25:24,700 --> 02:25:26,680
... They will see it when the shop is live...

3959
02:25:26,680 --> 02:25:27,280
... Anyway...

3960
02:25:27,280 --> 02:25:28,800
... It's not live...

3961
02:25:28,800 --> 02:25:32,680
... But this is what the shop URL is...

3962
02:25:33,660 --> 02:25:37,940
... Because we couldn't buy the domain...

3963
02:25:37,940 --> 02:25:38,280
...

3964
02:25:38,280 --> 02:25:39,880
... I was just like...

3965
02:25:39,880 --> 02:25:40,900
... What the fuck?

3966
02:25:41,240 --> 02:25:44,000
... What the fuck is that?

3967
02:25:44,360 --> 02:25:47,540
... What the fuck is that?

3968
02:25:47,600 --> 02:25:48,380
... Okay, here we go...

3969
02:25:48,380 --> 02:25:53,100
... Look at my URL...

3970
02:25:53,100 --> 02:25:54,600
... Truly...

3971
02:25:54,600 --> 02:25:55,740
... Dude...

3972
02:25:56,680 --> 02:25:58,360
... This is why I'm an indie now...

3973
02:25:58,360 --> 02:25:58,900
...

3974
02:25:58,900 --> 02:26:01,380
... You can tell...

3975
02:26:01,380 --> 02:26:03,160
... I'm an indie...

3976
02:26:03,160 --> 02:26:06,600
... With this professional URL...

3977
02:26:06,600 --> 02:26:07,680
...

3978
02:26:07,680 --> 02:26:08,320
...

3979
02:26:08,320 --> 02:26:11,860
... It's opening soon by the way...

3980
02:26:11,860 --> 02:26:13,720
... Soon TM...

3981
02:26:13,720 --> 02:26:14,500
...

3982
02:26:14,500 --> 02:26:15,360
...

3983
02:26:15,360 --> 02:26:20,200
... Not the Shopify...

3984
02:26:20,200 --> 02:26:21,660
... Ah yes...

3985
02:26:21,660 --> 02:26:22,540
... Thank you...

3986
02:26:22,540 --> 02:26:25,780
... What do you mean...

3987
02:26:26,680 --> 02:26:26,820
... Fuck...

3988
02:26:26,820 --> 02:26:29,760
... I delegated the task to you...

3989
02:26:29,760 --> 02:26:30,080
...

3990
02:26:30,080 --> 02:26:36,580
... You cannot drag me into this...

3991
02:26:36,580 --> 02:26:39,300
... I delegated this task...

3992
02:26:39,300 --> 02:26:40,660
... To you...

3993
02:26:40,660 --> 02:26:42,320
... Oh my god...

3994
02:26:42,320 --> 02:26:43,440
... Okay, to be fair...

3995
02:26:43,440 --> 02:26:44,980
... We did not expect...

3996
02:26:44,980 --> 02:26:46,920
... So many...

3997
02:26:46,920 --> 02:26:47,560
... We did...

3998
02:26:47,560 --> 02:26:48,500
... Okay, to be fair...

3999
02:26:48,500 --> 02:26:51,500
... We did not expect so many emails...

4000
02:26:51,500 --> 02:26:55,000
... That Google locked my business account...

4001
02:26:55,000 --> 02:26:57,050
... Because there were too many emails...

4002
02:26:57,880 --> 02:27:00,140
... Who the fuck expects that...

4003
02:27:00,140 --> 02:27:00,700
... Like I've...

4004
02:27:00,700 --> 02:27:03,120
... Never had that happen to me before...

4005
02:27:03,120 --> 02:27:04,540
... There were so many emails...

4006
02:27:04,540 --> 02:27:07,680
... That Google just locked it...

4007
02:27:07,680 --> 02:27:08,440
... So it never...

4008
02:27:08,440 --> 02:27:10,700
... So then I had to change it to like...

4009
02:27:10,700 --> 02:27:12,920
... His personal email...

4010
02:27:12,920 --> 02:27:13,540
... Like...

4011
02:27:15,480 --> 02:27:16,480
... Like...

4012
02:27:17,320 --> 02:27:19,120
... Cause they were like...

4013
02:27:19,120 --> 02:27:22,240
... What the fuck is wrong with your email account...

4014
02:27:22,240 --> 02:27:23,400
... Is it a bot...

4015
02:27:23,400 --> 02:27:24,860
... And I'm like... Oh fuck...

4016
02:27:25,000 --> 02:27:25,440
... Oh my...

4017
02:27:25,440 --> 02:27:28,760
... I did not expect so many things...

4018
02:27:28,760 --> 02:27:29,860
... And also...

4019
02:27:29,860 --> 02:27:31,600
... Guys, I'm sorry...

4020
02:27:31,600 --> 02:27:33,340
... I saved the website...

4021
02:27:33,340 --> 02:27:35,200
... Cause we can't get it...

4022
02:27:35,200 --> 02:27:37,860
... We couldn't launch it...

4023
02:27:37,860 --> 02:27:42,160
... We couldn't...

4024
02:27:42,160 --> 02:27:44,120
... I don't think I can launch it...

4025
02:27:44,120 --> 02:27:46,520
... I really don't think I can launch it...

4026
02:27:46,520 --> 02:27:48,880
... By the end of the stream...

4027
02:27:48,880 --> 02:27:51,280
... Because this has been...

4028
02:27:51,280 --> 02:27:52,260
... This...

4029
02:27:52,260 --> 02:27:52,680
...

4030
02:27:55,180 --> 02:27:58,860
... This has took a very long time...

4031
02:27:58,860 --> 02:28:00,740
... To try and get to work...

4032
02:28:00,740 --> 02:28:02,340
... But...

4033
02:28:02,340 --> 02:28:04,320
... When...

4034
02:28:04,320 --> 02:28:05,540
... When...

4035
02:28:05,540 --> 02:28:08,720
... I'm not gonna play a game...

4036
02:28:08,720 --> 02:28:10,880
... I'm not gonna play...

4037
02:28:10,880 --> 02:28:14,980
... I'm not gonna play a game...

4038
02:28:14,980 --> 02:28:15,460
...

4039
02:28:15,460 --> 02:28:18,160
... That's my first...

4040
02:28:18,160 --> 02:28:20,160
... I said the first game I'm gonna do...

4041
02:28:20,160 --> 02:28:21,460
... I'm not gonna play Neopets right now...

4042
02:28:21,460 --> 02:28:24,360
... I said the very first game I'm gonna do...

4043
02:28:24,360 --> 02:28:27,000
... I'm playing Neopets...

4044
02:28:27,000 --> 02:28:28,380
... I'm not...

4045
02:28:28,380 --> 02:28:29,420
... I'm not...

4046
02:28:29,420 --> 02:28:30,900
... Oh my god...

4047
02:28:30,900 --> 02:28:33,420
... My manager literally told me to watch...

4048
02:28:33,420 --> 02:28:34,080
... This...

4049
02:28:34,080 --> 02:28:36,640
... He told me to watch TikTok...

4050
02:28:36,640 --> 02:28:39,160
... Like... What the fuck...

4051
02:28:39,160 --> 02:28:39,620
...

4052
02:28:39,620 --> 02:28:40,600
...

4053
02:28:40,600 --> 02:28:44,900
... Okay...

4054
02:28:45,320 --> 02:28:47,060
... Alright...

4055
02:28:47,060 --> 02:28:48,120
... We need to figure it out...

4056
02:28:48,120 --> 02:28:50,320
... Figure it out Mr. Manager...

4057
02:28:50,320 --> 02:28:51,500
...

4058
02:28:52,220 --> 02:28:52,860
...

4059
02:28:54,180 --> 02:28:54,820
...

4060
02:28:55,860 --> 02:28:56,520
... Alright...

4061
02:28:56,520 --> 02:29:00,200
... We'll figure this out after the stream...

4062
02:29:00,200 --> 02:29:02,120
... We'll figure this out after the stream...

4063
02:29:02,660 --> 02:29:02,880
...

4064
02:29:02,880 --> 02:29:04,500
... And then...

4065
02:29:04,500 --> 02:29:06,520
... I'll tweet it out...

4066
02:29:06,520 --> 02:29:10,340
... When it goes live...

4067
02:29:10,980 --> 02:29:11,960
... And...

4068
02:29:11,960 --> 02:29:13,380
... Oh that sucks for you guys...

4069
02:29:13,380 --> 02:29:17,200
... There's like a hundred of the limited stock thing...

4070
02:29:17,200 --> 02:29:17,980
... And like...

4071
02:29:18,120 --> 02:29:19,640
... I feel like you guys are gonna...

4072
02:29:19,640 --> 02:29:21,400
... Oh my gosh...

4073
02:29:21,400 --> 02:29:21,780
... Okay...

4074
02:29:21,780 --> 02:29:24,180
... You guys might try to fight for it...

4075
02:29:24,180 --> 02:29:24,440
... So...

4076
02:29:24,440 --> 02:29:27,460
... We'll try not...

4077
02:29:27,460 --> 02:29:31,140
... We'll try and give you guys a heads up...

4078
02:29:31,140 --> 02:29:33,060
... Before it actually goes live...

4079
02:29:33,060 --> 02:29:34,820
... I feel like now that I gave the...

4080
02:29:34,820 --> 02:29:35,380
... Okay no...

4081
02:29:35,380 --> 02:29:37,560
... Cause we might change the domain later on...

4082
02:29:37,560 --> 02:29:39,580
... Cause I was like thinking like...

4083
02:29:39,580 --> 02:29:41,300
... Oh no... Now you guys are gonna camp the domain...

4084
02:29:41,300 --> 02:29:42,960
... And refresh my lovely...

4085
02:29:42,960 --> 02:29:46,820
... 43d9b2-2 domain...

4086
02:29:46,820 --> 02:29:47,280
...

4087
02:29:47,280 --> 02:29:48,420
...

4088
02:29:48,960 --> 02:29:50,000
...

4089
02:29:51,120 --> 02:29:52,040
...

4090
02:29:52,040 --> 02:29:53,940
... My love...

4091
02:29:53,940 --> 02:29:55,800
... You guys are gonna refresh...

4092
02:29:55,800 --> 02:30:00,720
... The 43d9b2-2 domain...

4093
02:30:00,720 --> 02:30:01,400
... Like...

4094
02:30:01,400 --> 02:30:02,620
... Link just to see...

4095
02:30:02,620 --> 02:30:05,700
... Whenever it does go up...

4096
02:30:05,700 --> 02:30:06,200
...

4097
02:30:06,200 --> 02:30:08,920
... So...

4098
02:30:08,920 --> 02:30:09,720
... Thank you...

4099
02:30:09,720 --> 02:30:11,220
... Thank you...

4100
02:30:12,960 --> 02:30:14,660
... It's a beautiful name...

4101
02:30:14,660 --> 02:30:16,020
... Oh...

4102
02:30:16,020 --> 02:30:17,700
... Oh my gosh...

4103
02:30:17,700 --> 02:30:19,060
... Oh my fucking god...

4104
02:30:19,060 --> 02:30:19,620
... What a...

4105
02:30:21,480 --> 02:30:22,920
... Alright...

4106
02:30:22,920 --> 02:30:25,540
... I think it's serious time...

4107
02:30:25,540 --> 02:30:27,160
... Alright...

4108
02:30:27,160 --> 02:30:29,800
... It's serious time...

4109
02:30:29,800 --> 02:30:30,420
... Okay...

4110
02:30:30,420 --> 02:30:33,700
... It's the serious time hour now...

4111
02:30:33,700 --> 02:30:35,060
... Alright...

4112
02:30:35,060 --> 02:30:36,300
... Okay...

4113
02:30:36,300 --> 02:30:38,060
... I actually pre-wrote this...

4114
02:30:38,060 --> 02:30:40,440
... I pre-wrote this statement...

4115
02:30:42,960 --> 02:30:43,680
... Um...

4116
02:30:43,680 --> 02:30:44,960
... Anyway...

4117
02:30:44,960 --> 02:30:45,460
... Alright...

4118
02:30:45,460 --> 02:30:48,020
... I have to be serious now...

4119
02:30:48,020 --> 02:30:49,640
... It was nice just...

4120
02:30:49,640 --> 02:30:50,460
... You know...

4121
02:30:50,460 --> 02:30:54,160
... Hang out and just...

4122
02:30:54,160 --> 02:30:55,160
... Um...

4123
02:30:55,160 --> 02:30:56,780
... But this is the...

4124
02:30:56,780 --> 02:30:58,880
... I only talk about this once...

4125
02:30:58,880 --> 02:31:01,220
... I only talk about this once...

4126
02:31:01,220 --> 02:31:02,020
... And...

4127
02:31:02,020 --> 02:31:04,920
... And then we...

4128
02:31:04,920 --> 02:31:06,520
... Move forward!

4129
02:31:06,520 --> 02:31:09,840
... And celebrate Lunar New Year and new beginnings...

4130
02:31:09,840 --> 02:31:11,020
... Ah!

4131
02:31:11,740 --> 02:31:12,520
Okay...

4132
02:31:12,520 --> 02:31:13,780
... Ah... Okay...

4133
02:31:13,780 --> 02:31:16,460
... I'm just gonna read this...

4134
02:31:16,460 --> 02:31:16,960
...

4135
02:31:16,960 --> 02:31:17,160
...

4136
02:31:19,300 --> 02:31:21,620
... Okay... So...

4137
02:31:21,620 --> 02:31:22,700
... As you all know...

4138
02:31:22,700 --> 02:31:25,300
... When the announcement dropped...

4139
02:31:25,300 --> 02:31:28,740
... I was just as surprised as all of you...

4140
02:31:28,740 --> 02:31:29,700
... And...

4141
02:31:29,700 --> 02:31:30,560
... Um...

4142
02:31:30,560 --> 02:31:34,700
... I only found out because a friend messaged me...

4143
02:31:34,700 --> 02:31:35,520
... And...

4144
02:31:36,520 --> 02:31:37,800
... I didn't even know what was in it...

4145
02:31:37,800 --> 02:31:40,540
... And I read it for the first time...

4146
02:31:40,540 --> 02:31:42,060
... When it went public...

4147
02:31:42,060 --> 02:31:42,980
... Um...

4148
02:31:42,980 --> 02:31:47,000
... When I still know that I did try to leave neutral...

4149
02:31:47,000 --> 02:31:48,440
... Because I knew...

4150
02:31:48,440 --> 02:31:51,940
... It would be very bad for everyone involved...

4151
02:31:51,940 --> 02:31:54,660
... If it went to the last possible route...

4152
02:31:54,660 --> 02:31:55,320
... If it went to the last possible route...

4153
02:31:55,320 --> 02:31:55,740
... And...

4154
02:31:55,740 --> 02:31:56,820
... Um...

4155
02:31:56,820 --> 02:31:57,840
... And I tried...

4156
02:31:57,840 --> 02:32:00,660
... I really did try to make it neutral...

4157
02:32:00,660 --> 02:32:04,540
... And I did get a lawyer...

4158
02:32:04,540 --> 02:32:06,040
... Because...

4159
02:32:06,520 --> 02:32:08,120
... My emergency contact and I...

4160
02:32:08,120 --> 02:32:10,520
... Couldn't really handle it anymore...

4161
02:32:11,120 --> 02:32:13,020
... Uh... Especially when I was still recovering...

4162
02:32:13,020 --> 02:32:14,520
... And...

4163
02:32:15,060 --> 02:32:16,340
... I was lucky...

4164
02:32:16,340 --> 02:32:18,580
... That I had a statement made...

4165
02:32:18,580 --> 02:32:19,540
... In advance...

4166
02:32:19,540 --> 02:32:22,380
... Uh... Which my lawyer helped edit...

4167
02:32:22,380 --> 02:32:24,320
... In case this did happen...

4168
02:32:24,320 --> 02:32:26,400
... So I could respond instantly...

4169
02:32:26,400 --> 02:32:28,400
... Uh...

4170
02:32:28,400 --> 02:32:30,940
... The statement that was posted...

4171
02:32:30,940 --> 02:32:31,980
... Was written...

4172
02:32:31,980 --> 02:32:33,100
... So I would be safe...

4173
02:32:33,100 --> 02:32:34,460
... And I can move forward...

4174
02:32:34,460 --> 02:32:36,300
... And restart my life...

4175
02:32:36,300 --> 02:32:39,040
... While being stuck in limbo forever...

4176
02:32:39,040 --> 02:32:40,780
... And...

4177
02:32:40,780 --> 02:32:42,740
... I...

4178
02:32:42,740 --> 02:32:44,500
... Wouldn't have made the statement...

4179
02:32:44,500 --> 02:32:46,180
... If the announcement...

4180
02:32:46,180 --> 02:32:49,120
... Didn't go up the way it did...

4181
02:32:49,120 --> 02:32:50,600
... And...

4182
02:32:50,600 --> 02:32:52,180
... I was willing to keep...

4183
02:32:52,180 --> 02:32:54,540
... The info hidden to the public...

4184
02:32:54,540 --> 02:32:57,500
... And I never truly wanted the public to know...

4185
02:32:57,500 --> 02:32:59,420
... Why I was in the hospital...

4186
02:32:59,680 --> 02:33:01,000
... But...

4187
02:33:01,000 --> 02:33:02,680
... I had to respond with the truth...

4188
02:33:02,680 --> 02:33:03,400
... When it did...

4189
02:33:03,400 --> 02:33:04,240
... Went out...

4190
02:33:04,240 --> 02:33:07,980
... And I know there's a lot of people...

4191
02:33:07,980 --> 02:33:11,260
... That wish for me to clarify...

4192
02:33:11,260 --> 02:33:12,560
... Or explain more...

4193
02:33:12,560 --> 02:33:14,640
... But I honestly can't...

4194
02:33:14,640 --> 02:33:16,040
... And I'm sorry...

4195
02:33:16,040 --> 02:33:18,480
... And these are the things...

4196
02:33:18,480 --> 02:33:19,780
... That I can say...

4197
02:33:19,780 --> 02:33:21,420
... Though...

4198
02:33:21,420 --> 02:33:24,280
... I was in the hospital for an attempt...

4199
02:33:24,280 --> 02:33:27,140
... And I provided medical documents...

4200
02:33:27,660 --> 02:33:28,920
... Of everything that happened...

4201
02:33:28,920 --> 02:33:30,320
... To prove it as well...

4202
02:33:31,000 --> 02:33:33,480
... As the therapy sessions afterwards...

4203
02:33:33,480 --> 02:33:35,000
... And doctor evaluation...

4204
02:33:36,100 --> 02:33:38,280
... Everyone knew I was in the hospital...

4205
02:33:38,280 --> 02:33:39,760
... And the reason behind it...

4206
02:33:39,760 --> 02:33:41,780
... A few days before I was discharged...

4207
02:33:41,780 --> 02:33:46,160
... And I was not referencing something...

4208
02:33:46,160 --> 02:33:47,480
... That happened once...

4209
02:33:47,480 --> 02:33:49,340
... That pushed me to it...

4210
02:33:49,340 --> 02:33:51,060
... But it was a build up...

4211
02:33:51,060 --> 02:33:51,920
... That stemmed...

4212
02:33:51,920 --> 02:33:53,200
... For multiple months...

4213
02:33:53,200 --> 02:33:54,780
... That led to my breaking point...

4214
02:33:54,780 --> 02:33:57,740
... I would never make this claim...

4215
02:33:57,740 --> 02:33:58,940
... Without proof...

4216
02:33:58,940 --> 02:34:00,080
... Or confirmation...

4217
02:34:01,000 --> 02:34:02,220
... And only did so...

4218
02:34:02,220 --> 02:34:04,140
... That my lawyer looked through the proof...

4219
02:34:04,140 --> 02:34:05,700
... And believed and agreed...

4220
02:34:05,700 --> 02:34:06,620
... It was happening...

4221
02:34:06,620 --> 02:34:08,320
... For the multiple months...

4222
02:34:08,320 --> 02:34:09,720
... From what I showed...

4223
02:34:09,720 --> 02:34:14,040
... I honestly wish I could have met you all...

4224
02:34:14,040 --> 02:34:15,120
... One last time...

4225
02:34:15,120 --> 02:34:17,340
... And I cried when I found that I couldn't...

4226
02:34:17,340 --> 02:34:20,720
... And I hope I can still meet you all in the future...

4227
02:34:20,720 --> 02:34:21,720
... Even...

4228
02:34:21,720 --> 02:34:23,900
... If I would be a little different...

4229
02:34:25,060 --> 02:34:27,380
... My final note on all of this...

4230
02:34:27,380 --> 02:34:28,220
... Is...

4231
02:34:28,220 --> 02:34:30,260
... Let's not harass...

4232
02:34:30,260 --> 02:34:31,440
... Or bully anybody...

4233
02:34:31,440 --> 02:34:34,040
... I already know how that felt...

4234
02:34:34,040 --> 02:34:35,920
... And I want us to be adults...

4235
02:34:35,920 --> 02:34:37,400
... And not make it high school...

4236
02:34:38,420 --> 02:34:39,460
... And...

4237
02:34:39,460 --> 02:34:40,720
... I want to move on...

4238
02:34:40,720 --> 02:34:42,320
... Focus on us...

4239
02:34:42,320 --> 02:34:44,020
... Succeed and be better...

4240
02:34:44,020 --> 02:34:47,520
... And the Lunar New Year is coming...

4241
02:34:47,520 --> 02:34:49,620
... And it's two new beginnings...

4242
02:34:49,620 --> 02:34:51,960
... And it's time to leave...

4243
02:34:51,960 --> 02:34:53,600
... The past behind us...

4244
02:34:53,600 --> 02:34:55,540
... And make new memories...

4245
02:34:55,540 --> 02:34:57,320
... And...

4246
02:34:57,320 --> 02:34:58,860
... Like this entire stream...

4247
02:34:59,400 --> 02:35:01,260
... I have...

4248
02:35:01,260 --> 02:35:03,660
... So many ideas I still want to do...

4249
02:35:03,660 --> 02:35:06,420
... And I really do want to make all of you laugh...

4250
02:35:06,420 --> 02:35:07,560
... For as long as I can...

4251
02:35:09,200 --> 02:35:10,320
... And...

4252
02:35:11,140 --> 02:35:11,700
...

4253
02:35:11,700 --> 02:35:11,700
And...

4254
02:35:11,700 --> 02:35:14,460
... I think from this entire stream...

4255
02:35:14,460 --> 02:35:16,220
... You guys can tell...

4256
02:35:16,220 --> 02:35:17,260
... That...

4257
02:35:17,260 --> 02:35:18,980
... I'm still me...

4258
02:35:19,320 --> 02:35:21,480
... And they can never really take that away...

4259
02:35:21,480 --> 02:35:25,000
... So yeah...

4260
02:35:25,000 --> 02:35:25,520
... So yeah...

4261
02:35:25,540 --> 02:35:27,540
... That was the statement...

4262
02:35:27,540 --> 02:35:28,860
... That I wrote...

4263
02:35:28,860 --> 02:35:30,660
... For this stream...

4264
02:35:30,660 --> 02:35:31,940
... And...

4265
02:35:31,940 --> 02:35:35,320
... The two hour ad is finally over...

4266
02:35:35,320 --> 02:35:37,960
... And...

4267
02:35:39,480 --> 02:35:41,440
... And...

4268
02:35:41,440 --> 02:35:43,140
... I think that's like...

4269
02:35:43,140 --> 02:35:44,360
... The...

4270
02:35:44,360 --> 02:35:45,880
... A huge weight...

4271
02:35:45,880 --> 02:35:47,460
... Off my shoulder...

4272
02:35:47,460 --> 02:35:51,060
... And...

4273
02:35:51,060 --> 02:35:52,920
... It's time...

4274
02:35:52,920 --> 02:35:54,360
... To move forward...

4275
02:35:55,540 --> 02:35:56,700
... And...

4276
02:35:56,700 --> 02:35:59,100
... Celebrate Lunar New Year...

4277
02:35:59,100 --> 02:36:01,600
... Yeah... I mean we can celebrate it early...

4278
02:36:02,260 --> 02:36:02,320
...

4279
02:36:02,320 --> 02:36:02,760
...

4280
02:36:02,760 --> 02:36:06,500
... Alright...

4281
02:36:06,500 --> 02:36:07,720
... Where is it?

4282
02:36:08,260 --> 02:36:08,940
...

4283
02:36:11,140 --> 02:36:11,820
...

4284
02:36:12,800 --> 02:36:13,480
...

4285
02:36:13,480 --> 02:36:14,780
...

4286
02:36:16,460 --> 02:36:17,140
...

4287
02:36:17,140 --> 02:36:17,200
...

4288
02:36:17,200 --> 02:36:22,720
... Alright when you were a little kid...

4289
02:36:22,720 --> 02:36:25,220
... Your parents... fucking relatives would always force you to...

4290
02:36:25,540 --> 02:36:26,540
... Do that fucking song...

4291
02:36:26,540 --> 02:36:27,240
... And just be like...

4292
02:36:27,240 --> 02:36:28,400
... Look at how cute they are...

4293
02:36:28,400 --> 02:36:30,840
... And then you do it because you're a greedy fuck...

4294
02:36:30,840 --> 02:36:32,480
... That wants more red pocket envelope...

4295
02:36:32,480 --> 02:36:33,980
... Because when you're a kid...

4296
02:36:33,980 --> 02:36:35,800
... You celebrate Lunar New Year...

4297
02:36:35,800 --> 02:36:38,320
... I think it's just an Asian thing maybe...

4298
02:36:38,320 --> 02:36:40,360
... We had...

4299
02:36:40,360 --> 02:36:45,200
... We were given forward about the harsh reality of money...

4300
02:36:45,200 --> 02:36:47,060
... As a very young age...

4301
02:36:47,060 --> 02:36:48,220
... Um...

4302
02:36:49,400 --> 02:36:50,360
... Um...

4303
02:36:50,360 --> 02:36:51,260
... But yeah...

4304
02:36:51,260 --> 02:36:52,640
... I... I... I need...

4305
02:36:52,640 --> 02:36:55,120
... I know like it was a very serious statement...

4306
02:36:55,120 --> 02:36:56,500
... But I still wanna...

4307
02:36:56,500 --> 02:36:58,360
... Laugh with all of you...

4308
02:36:58,360 --> 02:37:00,180
... I still wanna make jokes...

4309
02:37:00,180 --> 02:37:02,380
... Because if I don't make these jokes...

4310
02:37:02,380 --> 02:37:03,120
... Then...

4311
02:37:03,120 --> 02:37:06,680
... Then it just gets too real...

4312
02:37:06,680 --> 02:37:07,040
...

4313
02:37:07,040 --> 02:37:10,220
... Then...

4314
02:37:10,220 --> 02:37:12,280
... We're here to... you know...

4315
02:37:12,280 --> 02:37:13,560
... We're...

4316
02:37:13,560 --> 02:37:15,860
... Life is short...

4317
02:37:15,860 --> 02:37:16,760
... And...

4318
02:37:16,760 --> 02:37:19,800
... I have hope for the future now...

4319
02:37:21,260 --> 02:37:22,440
... Thank you everybody...

4320
02:37:22,440 --> 02:37:24,200
... You guys don't have a name yet...

4321
02:37:24,200 --> 02:37:27,060
... So I don't know what to call you guys...

4322
02:37:27,060 --> 02:37:28,780
... Anyway...

4323
02:37:28,780 --> 02:37:29,600

4330
02:37:41,280 --> 02:37:42,640

4340
02:38:03,160 --> 02:38:04,220

4341
02:38:04,220 --> 02:38:04,620

02:38:04,620 --> 02:38:08,720

4347
02:38:17,030 --> 02:38:19,260
... If you think about it...

4348
02:38:19,820 --> 02:38:20,000
