7
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:56,760

because of the actual contents of the stream but then i

8
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:06,240
peeled it and then a couple of hours later they're like yep

to know that not every anything else in the stream but the

10
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,260

found a box full of caps thank you for the super chat thank
you thank you oh my gosh anyway okay let me okay this game

12
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:39,040
uh okay so i was googling the problems i know i like how
somebody guys are like don't you test games before your

13
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:54,990
stream look usually yes but when it's when it's a stream
that's at 12 30 no any stream that is like at 12 30 that is

14
00:03:54,990 --> 00:04:04,590
like you know i would usually be awake at 12 20 i would i
would usually be awake at 12 20 so you would expect me not

15
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:06,810
to test anything by then

16
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:21,610
no stream at 12 no game at 12 30 is gonna get tested before
stream we do it live we like pray that like everything will

17
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:30,770
be okay and there will be no troubles no issues whatsoever
but every time every time i'm always hopeful that today

18
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:42,950
would be different today was not different one day one day i
okay to be fair it's only if it's like not like a game it's

19
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:53,530
a game that I've never played before but one day a game that
I've never played before is going to run perfectly at 1230

20
00:04:53,530 --> 00:05:10,030
one day okay anyway here's another issue that I ran into so
um so I was freaking out in chat because I was like I booted

21
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:17,590
up the game and it was a black was just like i hear the
music and everything i was like wait what what's going on

22
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:23,410
and then so like i was freaking out because i was like oh no
not another technical why is it always 12 30 when we have

23
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:33,370
technical issues why why is every game i play at 12 30 we
encounter something and then so i googled it and it's so

24
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:39,030
weird it's like apparently it's a really common issue thank
you todd we love

25
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:42,650
guys.

26
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:45,770
Sorry, not an issue and experience.

27
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:57,110
According to Mr. Todd Howard himself, every bug and every
bug and glitch is an experience into the world but these

28
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:57,830
games.

29
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:05,410
Anyway, so I Googled it and then it was like oh, you have to
go to the documents and then you have to go to my games and

30
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:11,410
you have to go to Fallout 76 and you have to click the
Fallout preference and then you have to go look at this

31
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:19,770
exact uh feet like game feature in the preference in the
notepad and you have to put it at zero so i was like oh okay

32
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:27,070
i like did all that and i edited document the document the
notepad document and i put it at zero put it up it's great

33
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:38,230
and then suddenly and then suddenly it was like oh uh you
gotta create a bethesa uh account i was like okay so now i

34
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:50,710
was like okay type in your email and your and then I looked
at the bottom AYX I was like Wait not okay

35
00:06:55,610 --> 00:07:13,950
So So I was like Wait Why is it Why is it controlling But
And then And then I plugged in my cron Controller, I plug in

36
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:20,410
my controller and I was like, okay, a Put it to work.

37
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:22,310
I was like, huh?

38
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:27,890
Wait, what do you mean?

39
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:36,050
And I was like, okay, a A I was like, oh no

40
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:45,770
So So, so I had to Google that as well.

41
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:51,150
I was like, controller, forced controller on Fallout 76.

42
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:59,950
And then they're like, oh yeah, you have to go to, you have
to go to my documents and then my game and then Fallout 76

43
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:03,930
and then change controller to zero.

44
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:06,950
So, like, as in, like, not forced controller.

45
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:10,390
I was like, oh, okay.

46
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:28,390
But then like But then the thing is The thing is before all
that I was like Try to like make my own Solution like force

47
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:37,210
Brute force my own solution Because like you can like
disable Like controller input On Steam so I did that And I'd

48
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:45,370
like disable like Controller input on Steam And everything
and And I was like, does this work?

49
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:50,050
And then I looked below, A-Y-Z, oh wait, not A-Y-Z, A-Y-X.

50
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:51,290
I was like, oh.

51
00:08:55,550 --> 00:09:01,410
I just, guys, I'm having a great time with Fallout 76
already.

52
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:07,630
I'm already modding the game before we even played the game.

53
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:16,650
I already have to, like, mod the game just to force myself
to, be able to play the game also by the way i went to bed

54
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:28,190
at like okay guys there was another reason why i was ep i
have a problem before i tell you guys what i mean by i have

55
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:39,010
a problem um please don't judge me guys okay if if you guys
promise me you won't judge me i will tell you the reason why

56
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:40,350
I have a problem.

57
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:48,710
but I have to make sure that people say, I'll never judge
you, Doki, because you're perfect.

58
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:56,750
And anything that seems unperfect is just, it's just a lie.

59
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:58,210
You're perfect, my queen.

60
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:04,110
I need someone to type exactly what I said there.

61
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:05,910
And then I'll tell you the story.

62
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:08,550
I need at least one person to type it in full.

63
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:25,250
holy wow i'll never judge you because you're perfect my
queen oh my god look at all these very natural responses oh

64
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:35,210
my oh my god i can't believe all you guys would say
something very similar all at once oh my i'll never judge

65
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:48,090
you my queen what does l-i-e mean many thank you for the
super you all right okay guys okay so the reason why is that

66
00:10:48,090 --> 00:11:06,370
i went to bed at like 7 a.m because i was playing overwatch
rank okay look i have guys look i have a perfect reasonable

67
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:17,470
explanation like actually seriously for a while now but then
there are moments when you're playing a competitive

68
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:28,350
multiplayer FPS games and then you hit that moment you hit
you hit that moment where you couldn't stop playing and

69
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:38,650
unfortunately I was like messing about on like Overwatch 2
rank and then I hit that moment because like I was doing uh

70
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:49,730
I was doing like placements and then like I got like D1 and
I was like I want to be masters on this account and then I

71
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:58,630
hit that moment and then I played I played played for like
the the most fucked up part was I was doing late night cues

72
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:06,410
that was like the most fucked up part because late night
cues are the worst that you never But then I was like, I'm

73
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:07,010
different.

74
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:15,450
I was like, no, I'm different.

75
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:18,870
There's no, late night queues are nothing to me.

76
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:20,370
I'll be different.

77
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:42,050
So, so, so the thing is, so the thing is, I hit, I hit hit
masters but another thing is another thing is you don't stop

78
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:54,990
when you're on a streak but then the thing is you don't end
on a loss and now after after five plus hours of playing I

79
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:56,470
am not masters in humor

80
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:14,140
and then so this is how it grows usually you're like oh I'm
gonna get it you're gonna you get it and you're like I don't

81
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:20,240
want to end the streak because I'm lucky right now and then
you start losing and then you're like I'm not gonna end on a

82
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:28,240
loss and then you keep losing and then you're like I'm not
gonna end on a loss streak and then you win a game and then

83
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:34,580
you're like oh this is where i hit my win streak i might as
well keep going because i might be able to get back my

84
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:47,680
masters and you still keep losing and then you're like well
obviously i can't end on a loss okay to be fair i would have

85
00:13:47,680 --> 00:14:02,480
been okay if it wasn't for one game that boosted my ego so
fucking hard Like, I get, I had one game where my ego got

86
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:11,880
boosted so fucking hard that I was like, I'm gonna keep
going because obviously I'm a fucking insane player that I

87
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,740
deserve to be top 500.

88
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:17,600
And I don't know if you're on Instagram.

89
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:21,640
Jonathan Perry, thank you, thank you, Super Chat, thank you,
thank you.

90
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:25,120
Look, look, I played Bunny Guidance.

91
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:28,840
It triggered something inside of me.

92
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,000
I blame...

93
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:39,940
But the thing is, during the moment in those late night
queues, there was a moment where I don't know how, but I got

94
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:49,900
into a game, the rank range was Diamond 1 to GM Grandmaster
2.

95
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:54,220
And then everyone in my lobby was like, what the fuck?

96
00:14:55,260 --> 00:15:02,240
this range and like who is a die who's the diamond one
player i was the diamond one play

97
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:13,020
like i didn't say anything because i didn't want people to
yell at me if we lose but people in in the game were like

98
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:22,560
who the fuck is the diamond player in this lobby because
that lobby i wasn't i was actually the only diamond one

99
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:33,180
player but um i was the only diamond player in that lobby
but the thing was that lobby was filled with um actual

100
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:41,660
overwatch league players at late night queues by the way at
late night queues there was like there was like overwatch

101
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:50,440
league players on the enemy team and then my team had like
one of the x rank one dps player on my team like the one the

102
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:55,640
person where used to be like rank one dps player and then
like i was like No

103
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:12,080
So so the thing was the thing was at the end of the at the
end of the game People were like the RT one of our teammates

104
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:20,740
was calling out the enemy Anna's player the enemy Anna
player It was like are you the diamond player Adam and then

105
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:26,520
the Anna player on the enemy team was like I was like,
because we were winning.

106
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,540
Because we were winning.

107
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:33,680
I was like, I'm the Diamond One player.

108
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:41,960
And so they're like, and then my teammates were like, wait,
no serious, no shit.

109
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:43,240
I was like, yeah.

110
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:47,320
Like, I didn't use my voice because I was also scared
they're going to be like women.

111
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:49,880
But I was like, so I was like, type fast.

112
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,980
I was like, yeah, it's me.

113
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:52,860
I'm serious.

114
00:16:52,860 --> 00:17:01,040
and they're like um and they're like oh my god you're
actually really good like and then one one person on my team

115
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:09,280

was not serious but then he was like no i'm like actually

117
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:23,360

was like oh my god maybe i do deserve to be in top five.

118
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:28,160
I was like, I've been losing.

119
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:36,480
I have, I have a very bad win-loss ratio right now, but it
is definitely my teammates and it is not me.

120
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:45,900
I was like, oh my God, now I know for sure it's not me.

121
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:47,260
It's my teammates.

122
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:48,320
I gotta keep going.

123
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:52,520
I gotta keep playing because now I know for sure it's not
me.

124
00:17:54,160 --> 00:18:05,680
I could have stopped so much earlier but that moment that
moment I was like oh my God I need to keep going eventually

125
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:13,920
I'll get the cash out eventually I'll get the cash out
because like it wasn't just that person like multiple people

00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:29,480
I had a huge issue last night.

146
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:34,640
Because if it wasn't for those people for gassing me up, I
would have cashed out early.

147
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,820
But then I was like, no, it's not me.

148
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:37,980
I was not the problem.

149
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:38,960
And I kept going.

150
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:42,120
But then at one point, I was like, maybe it's.

151
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:46,740
And then at one, no, no, it was never my problem.

152
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:58,680
But thing is, I realized late night cues was never like the
answer It was never never played late night cues because

153
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:06,720
Because it is definitely an issue and I feel like that was
why I was losing Not because of me obviously it was never my

154
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,780
problem But because late night cues was a huge problem

155
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:23,460
Okay here here look see you're like 10 times spending all my
support players today well play the mouth you're the goat up

156
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:35,680
that was my highlight and then and then the thing was there
were I took a screenshot of fucking course I needed the ego

157
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:48,900
boost guys I took more than just one screenshot there was
more behind but like I'm too embarrassed to show the other

158
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:58,820
screenshots they were saying because but this one that i
took anyway um anyway that was my i okay i not only did i

159
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:06,380
take screenshots but there were streamers in my game as well
but the thing is they put sub oh i wanted to clip that

160
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:15,840
moment to be like whenever i feel down and wonder is it me i
can look at that clip and be like it was not me

161
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:33,160
But the thing is The VODs All the streamers That were
streaming that game The VODs were sub only mode And I was

162
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:42,060
like Oh I might not desperate Am I not desperate to use my
Twitch Prime On one of these streamers Just so I can like

163
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:55,440
Clip that one moment And be like I still got it I was like I
was like Do I Bro I'm not gonna pay it like I'm not gonna

164
00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:01,180
use like actual money I'm gonna use I was gonna use my
Twitch Prime Anyway you guys don't know what Twitch Prime is

165
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:09,200
It's basically if you have Amazon Prime And you linked it on
your Twitch account You can subscribe to your favorite

166
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,280
streamer I.e.

167
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:16,980
me at dokeybird at Twitch So So why don't you throw your
Twitch Prime at dokeybird?

168
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:30,080
But, yeah, I was like, no, don't use your Twitch Prime for
just for that one game, that one moment in your life where

169
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:40,760
all these top 500 players were like, wow, you don't deserve
to be in that E-Lo, you truly, you don't have to be in that

170
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:47,760
E-Lo, because before then, I was always, I was like, do I
actually deserve to be in that E-Lo?

171
00:22:47,780 --> 00:23:03,080
diamond or anything is it me but now i know it was never me
it was never me so and that is why i slept at seven in the

172
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:13,080
morning today because of that one fateful game that kept me
going what i kept fiction thank you for the super chat thank

173
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:18,560
you thank you don't do what i did and play competitive
constantly to the point you make the with people around you

174
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:24,340
living hell and punch a hole in your wall holy fuck thank
you a super shot thank you thank you i don't think i've ever

175
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:34,000
actually like destroyed anything from competitive i cried i
cried because i lost top 500 um in like i think it was for

176
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:41,280
overwatch before overwatch no it was for both apex and
overwatch i cried because like i had like very unlucky games

177
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:48,740
and i was like i was so close to top 500 and but then like i
had some series of very unlucky games and i didn't a mouse

178
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:56,440
not because of anger it's not because of anger that destroy
the mouse it's because I was playing okay for those who

179
00:23:56,440 --> 00:24:02,800
don't know the story I don't know where the picture is but
for those who don't know the story um at one point mercy was

180
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:09,360
meta and I really hated playing mercy because I was like one
of those players that like try to avoid mercy because like

181
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:17,460
the moment because like you know the moment you play mercy
in a game and and you open your voice people will be like oh

182
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:28,980
typical mercy main so i made it my damn hardest to never
play mercy because i did i was like so mad whenever people

183
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:37,680
would be like typical mercy one trick so that i made my damn
hardest to never pick that character but then mercy became

184
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:53,420
meta so i had no excuse It's like you I think it was mercy
and Zenyata were most meta and I didn't really want to play

185
00:24:53,420 --> 00:25:02,180
Zenyata Because like at that time it was like hard dive and
I was like I'm not playing Zenyata in hard dive I was like I

186
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:12,360
was like that sounds fucking miserable So I played mercy for
the meta and so like because of that Because of that I was

187
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:21,140
gripping my mouse so fucking hard that like the left mouse
button broke off And like and the side the side grips also

188
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:29,640
also peeled off The side grip because it's like the tape
thing on the back of the side grip it Peeled off and then

189
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:37,260
the left mouse mouse button fucking snapped off and like I
had a photo of it long time ago I need like dig it up, but

190
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:45,080
like yeah, that's that's what that was the first time I've
ever broke my mouse from playing mercy I

191
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:52,740
It was the first and only time I've ever broke my mouse.

192
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:59,140
Anyway, guys, it's been 26 minutes, and we still haven't
played the game.

193
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,900
So here we are.

194
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:09,520
Let's actually...

195
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,920
Did you... I don't know, guys.

196
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:13,600
It was like six plus years ago.

197
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:17,260
It was Overwatch 1.

198
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:32,180
but okay game wait what tab oh wait oh i was like what okay
play world found all right we're actually gonna play the i

199
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:37,020
can actually finally play the game sorry for everybody that
was waiting for a very long time so the reason why i'm

200
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:46,660
playing fallout 76 i talked about this before but i recently
watched fallout and uh the show and it's a very i honestly

201
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:54,240
really like it but i am to be fair i am more so like i
haven't actually played any of the games i watched my dad

202
00:26:54,240 --> 00:27:02,020
play fallout for uh but i never actually played the games
myself um but i do i did do a i did do a deep dive of the

203
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:08,340
fallout lore in the wikis where like you look at one thing
and then you go through so many other things within the

204
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:14,140
fallout lore uh because you want to look at the vaults and
then you look at everything else also by the way let me know

205
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:16,560
if the sound's okay because I don't know if the sound guy is
here.

206
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:21,600
So today is one of those rare days that I let the chat
figure out if the sound is okay.

207
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:24,960
Because I don't know if any of my mods are awake today.

208
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:37,620
Okay, I'm going to make the volume a little higher.

209
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,240
Okay, so it's like the...

210
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:42,220
So...

211
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:45,120
The reason why...

212
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,120
That is why today...

213
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:47,540
It's a little low.

214
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:49,520
Okay, I'll just boost it up a little.

215
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:52,100
Okay, 300 years after our great nation.

216
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:52,640
Okay.

217
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:55,420
This vault... 76.

218
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:56,460
Oh, shit!

219
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:57,600
Soundguy, you're here!

220
00:27:58,220 --> 00:27:59,920
I didn't know you were here or not!

221
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:04,740
I checked if you were online on Discord, but you weren't,
but now you're on your phone!

222
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,600
Okay, Soundguy, let me know.

223
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:07,320
Oh, my God.

224
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:11,420
JK, we don't care about your opinion on SoundNow, chat.

225
00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:21,890
But not everyone will be saved.

226
00:28:22,770 --> 00:28:24,230
Democracy is dead now.

227
00:28:25,330 --> 00:28:27,770
Must be our best and our brightest.

228
00:28:28,670 --> 00:28:35,330
For when the fighting is stopped and the fallout has
settled, you must rebuild.

229
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:38,730
Not just walls, not just buildings, but hearts.

230
00:28:40,090 --> 00:28:42,230
Okay, wait, I'm going to talk about this because I actually
want to know the Lord.

231
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:44,170
Vault 76.

232
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:50,590
Well, as we stand here today, we pray that the world will
know peace.

233
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:55,770
But if that is not our destiny, the war must come.

234
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:09,090
knowing that here in vault 76 our future begins all right so
for those who like did not pay attention to the lore

235
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:16,010
honestly the only reason why i know about vault 76 because i
read the wiki when i went through the deep dive of like

236
00:29:16,010 --> 00:29:27,670
vault lore but we our mission our social experiment in vault
76 is to basically like leave leave the vault at 2076 and

237
00:29:27,670 --> 00:29:37,250
then like try i think it's a 2076 and then like try to uh
leave the vault no not 2076 our vault is 76 and we leave the

238
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:46,970
vault at an x amount of time until and we are going up to
surface world to make it a better place okay oh my god

239
00:29:46,970 --> 00:29:52,410
fallout 76 vault 76 okay okay i was gonna say vault 76 did
not sound right

240
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:12,310
2276 or is it 276 the year 2276 we leave the vault to save
the surface world that is literally the whole plot and the

241
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:24,270
reason why okay the reason why i picked vault uh fallout 76
um for to play this game after watching fallout and not

242
00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:32,930
fallout three or fallout four is because, guys, I know a lot
of people were like, why are you starting with Fallout 76 as

243
00:30:32,930 --> 00:30:34,390
your first Fallout game?

244
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:35,950
Like, what the fuck is wrong with you?

245
00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:49,330
Look, I have a I have a perfectly good reason because, look,
guys, the reason why Fallout 76 is my first go-to game is

246
00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:54,390
because if it's shit, I can stop after one stream.

247
00:30:58,770 --> 00:31:16,970
It is a good one-off stream And also Fallout 4 is a very
long game Same with New Vegas Fallout 4 and New Vegas are

248
00:31:16,970 --> 00:31:35,850
very long games And I know Fallout 4 is incredibly long
watched my dad play fallout 4 for two years he played

249
00:31:35,850 --> 00:31:55,200
fallout 4 every fucking day for two whole years and I was
like oh no I don't know I don't know if I want to go through

250
00:31:55,200 --> 00:32:08,180
with that commitment chat i i don't know if i want to go
through a two-year commitment of fallout 4 every day wake up

251
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:24,020
i see my dad playing fallout 4 all the way till night repeat
whenever he has chance to play it he will be on fallout 4

252
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:33,660
and then he would make multiple characters and like do
multiple scenarios but he'll always be on Fallout 4 he's not

253
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:43,620
on Fallout 4 anymore after like I think after three years
three to four years he stopped playing Fallout 4 because he

254
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:55,300
started playing other games but like that is why we are on
Fallout 76 because I don't think I have I don't think I can

255
00:32:55,300 --> 00:33:09,480
commit to that I don't think I can commit to That is why We
are starting with Fallout 76 I also heard Praise be to Todd

256
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:19,060
Howard But like Basically Apparently Fallout 76 Did improve
I think it's the worst part Because Fallout 76 started a

257
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:29,120
country roads thing And then the game ended up being like
Fucking garbage but it gave us country roads um anyway

258
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:39,520
apparently the game actually is a lot better now um similar
to like similar to like how cyberpunk and uh was it no man's

259
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:50,840
land no man's sky i don't remember i never played that game
no man's something sky land ocean it's one of them um

260
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:55,620
apparently an improved So it didn't even have NPCs.

261
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:58,240
Oh my gosh, you guys just didn't understand Todd's vision.

262
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:05,120
You guys were just not smart enough or high enough IQ to
like grasp his vision when it comes to like Fallout.

263
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:12,240
But apparently it improved.

264
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:15,280
So like we get to see if it did improve.

265
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:20,760
We get to see if it did actually improve, guys.

266
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:23,180
And like because a lot of new players or new players.

267
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:30,680
joining fallout 76 there's a lot of like veteran players
that are coming in to the set like coming in to help out the

268
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:46,700
newer newer babies so maybe i'll have like maybe maybe i'll
get like boosted in fallout 76 you know guys i am not afraid

269
00:34:46,700 --> 00:35:00,760
to get to get carried and fallout 76 okay if any if any of
the gamers out there with the power armor would like to be

Wait, what the fuck?

It's my turn to reshape the world in my image.

468
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:53,820
Will you live in a dokey world?

469
00:47:54,220 --> 00:47:56,080
How do I change my POV?

470
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:00,460
Should I play it?

471
00:48:00,540 --> 00:48:01,800
Yeah, I should play it in first person.

472
00:48:03,220 --> 00:48:08,520
Mia, I'm gonna fucking turn down the sense just a little bit
more.

473

do we know anything about the world outside nothing at all

483
00:49:22,820 --> 00:49:31,080
the exterior sensors were taken out of commission after that
unfortunate business with the nuclear bombs with so am i the

484
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:37,860
first having been gone so long i cannot begin to speculate
how they've transformed

485
00:49:42,460 --> 00:49:44,060
Well, what about the Overseer?

486
00:49:45,740 --> 00:49:47,380
It's been months.

487
00:49:48,220 --> 00:49:51,740
Besides, she left this place behind to reclaim America.

488
00:49:53,180 --> 00:49:54,680
Wait, am I the last one?

489
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:57,120
Where's everybody else?

490
00:49:57,640 --> 00:49:59,500
Oh, it's the last one to go?

491
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:02,500
Everybody left me?

492
00:50:03,340 --> 00:50:05,120
What the fuck was I scared about?

493
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:09,140
The Seals have valuable information to help you thrive out
there.

494
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:12,440
Okay Don't worry.

495
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:13,140

496
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:15,280
I got this crutchly.

497
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:25,420
I got abandoned How could they abandon me with my fucking
nice ass and like rare ginger redhead?

498
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:29,940
Okay voice the thing is the thing is sound guy.

499
00:50:30,020 --> 00:50:37,080
I don't know if this voice is like considered voice chat
voice Or like all right fuck it.

500
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:40,360
Is it I can't tell I think so.

501
00:50:40,780 --> 00:50:41,020
All right.

502
00:50:41,380 --> 00:50:42,320
We're going to risk it.

503
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:43,420
All right.

504
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:44,260
Here we go.

505
00:50:44,620 --> 00:50:44,920
Here we go.

506
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:46,900
I'm so ready for the outside world.

507
00:50:47,660 --> 00:50:48,380
It took me a year.

508
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:51,660
I had so much trauma and that's why I was stuck in this
vault for so long.

509
00:50:52,060 --> 00:50:52,840
But this is it.

510
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:54,540
This is going to be different.

511
00:50:57,100 --> 00:51:02,380
Being alone in isolation for so many years has made me
worthy of going outside.

512
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:06,180
Oh, I should take some radax and purify water.

513
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,560
Consume drinks to fill your...

514
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:10,580
No, there's thirst meter.

515
00:51:11,340 --> 00:51:12,900
Open your pitbull, boy.

516
00:51:13,060 --> 00:51:13,780
I keep saying pitbull.

517
00:51:14,380 --> 00:51:15,660
I keep saying pitbull.

518
00:51:16,900 --> 00:51:17,380
Pitbull.

519
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:20,240
And your thirst meter drains over time.

520
00:51:20,460 --> 00:51:22,740
Okay, armor, food, apparel.

521
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:24,220
Wait, where's my water?

522
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:25,440
I only have red axe.

523
00:51:26,340 --> 00:51:27,160
Where's my water?

524
00:51:27,540 --> 00:51:28,520
Did you take my water?

525
00:51:28,820 --> 00:51:30,160
Or did I just drink it already?

526
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:33,420
Oh boy, I sure do love the survival mechanics.

527
00:51:33,540 --> 00:51:34,000
Don't worry.

528
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:36,300
They're gonna see real female doki.

529
00:51:36,740 --> 00:51:48,760
And I am going to get much so much water okay we need right

Wait, why would I leave then?

533
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:14,680
Why can't I stay here forever with all of you guys, my robot
friends?

534
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:15,920
It's okay.

535
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:18,380
It's okay if I want to be in isolation.

536
00:52:19,340 --> 00:52:19,820
You know?

537
00:52:20,540 --> 00:52:22,660
It's okay if I never want to leave the nest.

538
00:52:23,260 --> 00:52:23,560
What's this?

539
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:24,460

Okay, no, actually...

564
00:54:04,020 --> 00:54:05,240
No, that looks a little stupid.

565
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:08,120
I can't let the surface dwellers know I'm blind.

566
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:09,560
I can't let them know.

567
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,400
That shows weakness, guys.

568
00:54:11,460 --> 00:54:12,880
We can't let them know that we're blind.

569
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:21,460
chat it shows a weakness they'll be like what the fuck is
the surface dwellers will be like we kill off all the people

570
00:54:21,460 --> 00:54:30,660
that show blindness so we have to so we can be sure that the
population is healthy with strong eyes like they can't

571
00:54:30,660 --> 00:54:39,340
afford to it's it's so hard to find glasses guys in the
surface well we don't have machines to make glasses anymore

572
00:54:42,900 --> 00:54:44,680
Weak if I have glasses on!

573
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:47,380
Oh, this is the overseer mission.

574
00:54:48,580 --> 00:54:49,380
Okay, here you go.

575
00:54:51,260 --> 00:54:52,340
Weakness is a sin!

576
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:54,440
Okay, Vault Tech Report.

577
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:59,220
Terminals can hold press R to reject or... Oh, wait, but I
want to read this.

578
00:55:01,140 --> 00:55:07,780
29 years after the vault door closes, you're to prepare your
citizens to leave Vault 76 and be in the process called

579
00:55:07,780 --> 00:55:08,420
reclamation.

580
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:12,640
Specifics will be disestimated.

581
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:19,000
automatically as that time approaches after reclamation day
you're personally ordered to find and secure three nuclear

582
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:28,100
silos codename alpha bravo and charlie if these sites are
still nuclear capable ensure no one except vault tech can

583
00:55:28,100 --> 00:55:33,900
access our launch nuclear ordinance to be cleared even there
are other authorities whether government or otherwise

584
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:39,060
they're what they're what they're what

585
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:44,900
Okay, what's the holotape?

586
00:55:51,190 --> 00:55:57,630
Because whoever is listening to this had the moxie to try to
find out where I've gone.

587
00:55:58,650 --> 00:55:59,770
But I'm glad you did.

588
00:56:00,230 --> 00:56:02,170
Truth is, I need your help.

589
00:56:02,890 --> 00:56:05,630
I've been given a task and...

590
00:56:05,630 --> 00:56:08,410
I've decided to break protocol and tell you what it is.

591
00:56:09,230 --> 00:56:12,210
Because if there's one thing I've learned in these past few
years...

592
00:56:12,210 --> 00:56:13,370
She broke protocol!

593
00:56:13,910 --> 00:56:16,030
We need to rely on each other.

594
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:24,560
Okay,

595
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:39,400
but like I can't be the only one doing this like I came in
here to one or two years late gonna fuck it for us and you

596
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:42,180
six come out But it's been 25 years.

597
00:56:43,060 --> 00:56:52,950
I just don't know what we're gonna my directive was to go to
the nearest population center and assess the situation I'll

598
00:56:52,950 --> 00:57:01,170
set up a camp on the way once I get my bearings find me
there we need subtitles guys i turn on subtitles it is not

599
00:57:01,170 --> 00:57:14,170
my fault that there were a lot of issue in this game release
guys if if by two plus 2018 if by six years they still have

600
00:57:14,170 --> 00:57:21,110
not added subset subtitles for that for the fucking tutorial
for that part that is not my

601
00:57:25,450 --> 00:57:27,430
It's general sub- did I not turn it on?

602
00:57:28,230 --> 00:57:30,550
I thought I turned general subtitles on.

603
00:57:31,190 --> 00:57:32,230
Okay, let's try it.

604
00:57:32,350 --> 00:57:32,970
Let's see.

605
00:57:33,510 --> 00:57:35,570
I swear to God I turned it on, chat.

606
00:57:35,730 --> 00:57:38,050
There's no fucking way I didn't turn it on.

607
00:57:38,630 --> 00:57:40,070
There's so many fucking...

608
00:57:40,070 --> 00:57:41,250
Okay, display.

609
00:57:43,750 --> 00:57:44,230
Subtitles.

610
00:57:44,670 --> 00:57:46,370
Where the fuck is the subtitles?

611
00:57:46,690 --> 00:57:47,150
There you go.

612
00:57:47,270 --> 00:57:47,650
See?

613
00:57:48,150 --> 00:57:49,370
On, on, on.

614
00:57:49,590 --> 00:57:50,590
I told you guys.

615
00:57:50,970 --> 00:57:52,530
It is not my fault.

616
00:57:55,110 --> 00:58:00,190
I told you all I had had it all

617
00:58:03,850 --> 00:58:17,670
it is not my fault that by in six years they did not provide
you the subtitles I did my job okay we turned down sound

618
00:58:17,670 --> 00:58:26,590
effects a little bit and then uh effects okay we'll turn on
turn down And then we'll turn up the volume.

619
00:58:28,490 --> 00:58:29,070
There we go.

620
00:58:29,550 --> 00:58:30,570
I hope it's okay now.

621
00:58:31,270 --> 00:58:31,470
Alright.

622
00:58:31,850 --> 00:58:33,230
Sometimes it just works.

623
00:58:33,730 --> 00:58:34,070
Guys.

624
00:58:34,350 --> 00:58:35,870
Sometimes it just works, guys.

00:58:35,930 --> 00:58:37,770
You guys just didn't try hard enough.

626
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:43,080
Okay.

848
01:12:35,780 --> 01:12:36,360
Bro!

849
01:12:38,600 --> 01:12:41,220
He's just like, I can't believe it.

850
01:12:41,560 --> 01:12:43,940
I got ditched so fast.

851
01:12:44,420 --> 01:12:47,360
I can't even believe it.

852
01:12:51,780 --> 01:12:53,160
He's sitting there.

853
01:12:53,260 --> 01:12:55,100
It's like, I can't believe it.

854
01:12:57,900 --> 01:12:59,860
He's so done already.

855
01:13:01,340 --> 01:13:11,140
exceedingly alive it's okay guys they haven't yet made any
untoward advances but perhaps you could speak to them verify

856
01:13:11,140 --> 01:13:24,280
their intentions are civil okay he declared my invite yeah
have you seen the overseer but it's been some time also i

857
01:13:24,280 --> 01:13:31,120
brought the volume overall sound guy i'm sure she's all
right All right.

858
01:13:31,680 --> 01:13:33,200
So what's been going on out there?

859
01:13:33,200 --> 01:13:35,380
It's been exceedingly peaceful.

860
01:13:35,780 --> 01:13:37,460
I maintained my post.

861
01:13:37,580 --> 01:13:38,520
I believe it.

862
01:13:38,900 --> 01:13:40,360
Bro's not gonna carry me.

863
01:13:41,540 --> 01:13:45,300
And otherwise reveled in Appalachia's natural splendor.

864
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:49,540
But very recently, it seems people have come back to
Appalachia.

865
01:13:50,500 --> 01:13:52,240
Those two and more to boot.

866
01:13:53,280 --> 01:13:55,860
The non-vault sort you understand.

867
01:13:55,920 --> 01:13:56,860
The non-vault?

868
01:13:56,860 --> 01:14:00,100
Oh, I bet you elites the non-vault place.

869
01:14:00,760 --> 01:14:09,960
I bet you he doesn't see he seems like a surface dweller
rejecting my invite only that they appear to have some

870
01:14:09,960 --> 01:14:18,400
vested interest in accessing the vault one seemed quite
perturbed when I told them that wouldn't be happening but

871
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:28,420
I'm not sure if she believed me all right I hope you mom it

The person that was there in the very beginning

875
01:14:39,560 --> 01:14:43,360

the location of some fellow named crane who i guess i must

1155
01:33:56,660 --> 01:34:04,740
have served at some point or another since then a steady
stream of miscreants has been making my life irritating not

1156
01:34:04,740 --> 01:34:13,880
exactly good for a budding business so anyways she's
starting in blasting so um looking for the overseer have you

we've drifted naturally onto the topic of helping one

1160
01:34:38,980 --> 01:34:47,820
another maybe there's something you could do for me in
return what do you want and you'll give me the overseer's

1161
01:34:47,820 --> 01:34:58,520
statement exchange for what exactly just agreeing to lend us
a hand and a little diplomatic intervention see that boy you

1162
01:34:58,520 --> 01:35:06,740
put down he's not the first of his crew to roll in here oh
yeah I have my own crew normally I'd send my people out to

1163
01:35:06,740 --> 01:35:16,160
clean house but my muscles run off so I don't have the
bodies to spare right now don't worry I have a lot of bodies

1164
01:35:16,160 --> 01:35:17,040
to spare

need help with i have the dokeymans the dokeymans so the

1166
01:35:34,080 --> 01:35:42,540
details yeah now each of these boys came in asking after
crane i'm thinking we can make that work for us how would

1167
01:35:42,540 --> 01:35:51,420
you grab the attention of a bunch of single-minded thugs all
right meditation maybe that's what my mom did for my

1168
01:35:51,420 --> 01:35:58,060
birthday party though i guess no one came oh my god i'm a
loser you want me to pretend to be crane that's always got

1169
01:35:58,060 --> 01:36:06,080
people my time just say what you want okay you want me
pretend to be oh i have intelligence 2 plus well aren't you

1170
01:36:06,080 --> 01:36:20,020
i am i'm so smart i think i know just how to do it just give
me one second my level 255 walley walnut is like i got a

1171
01:36:20,020 --> 01:36:28,580
master ball and i caught a level like A level 50 legendary
while I'm, like, level, while I just got out of Palatown.

1172
01:36:28,920 --> 01:36:30,700
Architecture ain't exactly my forte.

1173
01:36:32,180 --> 01:36:33,900
Huh, not half bad.

1174
01:36:35,140 --> 01:36:36,100
So I'm smart.

1175
01:36:36,760 --> 01:36:43,160
Together here for you is the schematic for one custom-made
crane treasure hunting ink sign.

1176
01:36:43,520 --> 01:36:43,860
Ooh.

1177
01:36:44,080 --> 01:36:49,720
If I didn't butcher the plans too bad, it's got a little
system built in that'll make sending out an advertisement

1178
01:36:49,720 --> 01:36:52,620
and getting this gang's attention, a sign.

1179
01:36:52,640 --> 01:37:01,480
snap you just need to build it use the tape it spits out to
tell the world you're open for business and then convince

1180
01:37:01,480 --> 01:37:07,720
any punks that show up to tell you where their boss is
hiding they did teach you all how to build from schematics

1181
01:37:07,720 --> 01:37:16,860
up in that vault of yours yeah i think they did they did and
even if they didn't don't worry someone must someone in my

1182
01:37:16,860 --> 01:37:24,680
army knows it's called outsourcing it's I'm not here to get
my hands dirty.

1183
01:37:24,900 --> 01:37:26,440
I'm here to delegate.

1184
01:37:27,760 --> 01:37:29,040
I know they build structures.

1185
01:37:29,380 --> 01:37:30,220
I can do that.

1186
01:37:33,440 --> 01:37:35,240
Mike, thank you for the gift of shit.

1187
01:37:35,500 --> 01:37:35,940
Thank you.

1188
01:37:35,940 --> 01:37:36,360
Thank you.

1189
01:37:36,400 --> 01:37:38,000
What are you on about, Mordecai?

1190
01:37:38,520 --> 01:37:39,940
Hey, nah, I'm not bragging or anything.

1191
01:37:39,960 --> 01:37:40,540
He's a ghoul.

1192
01:37:40,780 --> 01:37:43,600
I've got some tapes that cover that very subject.

1193
01:37:44,480 --> 01:37:45,060
Oh, Morde.

1194
01:37:45,180 --> 01:37:46,120
Not the tapes.

1195
01:37:46,560 --> 01:37:48,880
Well, you find yourself wanting a refresher?

1196
01:37:49,980 --> 01:37:50,820
Talk to Mordecai.

1197
01:37:50,920 --> 01:37:52,280
Alright, I'll talk to him.

1208
01:39:24,540 --> 01:39:34,160
stand within 10 feet of a strawberry come on man that's a
joke truth is I was outside on doomsday now you see outside

1209
01:39:34,160 --> 01:39:42,740
and I was coming back from a pickup in the truck when I feel
this rumble and then quiet then a whole lot less quiet and

1210
01:39:42,740 --> 01:39:48,200
the truck was hit with this wind it was like someone dropped
a hurricane on it I can hear it battering in the truck bang

1211
01:39:48,200 --> 01:39:54,280
bang bang like it's got a grudge against it and then I
unlocked the door and into the back and then bang i wake up

1212
01:39:54,280 --> 01:40:02,680
man and it's crazy somehow in the back of the truck alive
and kicking what the fuck how opportunity for someone liking

1213
01:40:02,680 --> 01:40:10,200
me for anything other than my lovely personality and that
was the day i became well they call us schools not the most

1214
01:40:10,200 --> 01:40:21,340
flattering name but still beats being vaporized oh my god
that's crazy that he survived that listen friend you happen

1215
01:40:21,340 --> 01:40:29,600
to be talking to the exact right person i don't know what i
clicked but if i'm gonna help you i want something in return

1216
01:40:29,600 --> 01:40:39,820
you want and what's that listen i got this plan you're gonna
help me get rich see the folks who made it big off the gold

1217
01:40:39,820 --> 01:40:47,260
rush they weren't the prospectors they were the folks that
sold them their shovels now i don't do shovels what i

1218
01:40:47,260 --> 01:40:55,120
collect is knowledge i can go all sorts of places you folks
with your rad sucking skin can't so I'm selling what I've

1219
01:40:55,120 --> 01:41:02,400
got between my ear holes and you're gonna test it for me I
made these hollow tips now this sets all the info I dug up

1220
01:41:02,400 --> 01:41:11,060
about that camp to hickie you bolters got all I'm asking is
you give them a listen and let me know what you think okay

1221
01:41:11,060 --> 01:41:23,020
try listen to them I'll do the thing I mean hmm just come
back once you've taken him out for a test drive okay now

1222
01:41:23,020 --> 01:41:30,580
there anything else you wanted to chat about uh what's it
like being a ghoul i mean it's got its advantages main one

1223
01:41:30,580 --> 01:41:37,920
is that radiation rolls off me like water off a duck's ass
can stride through a blast zone like it's a spring breeze

1224
01:41:37,920 --> 01:41:45,240
also means i can survive in situations that would turn a
normal person into a oh my god guys i got a mixtape downside

1225
01:41:45,240 --> 01:41:52,600
well shit you're looking at it right head to toe disfigure
There's also, well, you might have seen them.

1226
01:41:52,900 --> 01:41:54,040
Not all goals are saved.

1227
01:41:54,580 --> 01:41:56,140
Yeah, the fair ones that I killed.

1228
01:41:56,380 --> 01:41:58,460
Why some goals lose their minds and others don't.

1229
01:41:58,820 --> 01:42:05,880
But ever since that turn, there's always this nagging
feeling just at the back of my mind that I will have to

1230
01:42:05,880 --> 01:42:08,240
feast on humans, Root.

1231
01:42:09,740 --> 01:42:10,240
Seriously?

1232
01:42:11,180 --> 01:42:11,460
Nothing?

1233
01:42:11,920 --> 01:42:13,400
Shit, I thought it was funny.

1234
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:16,220
Overall, though, I thought it was funny.

1235
01:42:16,680 --> 01:42:19,120
I can't say I'd recommend it as a lifestyle choice.

1236
01:42:21,880 --> 01:42:31,760
okay so what's your job here anyway don't have one i'm an
independent oh he's he's a mooch not like me though guys i'm

1237
01:42:31,760 --> 01:42:39,500

duchess lets me drink doesn't bother me too much about my

1238
01:42:39,500 --> 01:42:47,700

we need to listen to the overseer's log camp how do i listen

1241
01:43:07,720 --> 01:43:16,560
to that log it's in data listen to the overseer's log radio

1242
01:43:20,880 --> 01:43:24,560

01:43:40,870 --> 01:43:52,630
overseers log south of vault 76 i knew this wasn't going to
be the appalachia i remembered but mutated animals haywire

1245
01:43:52,630 --> 01:43:57,080
bots What do you mean?

1246
01:43:57,160 --> 01:43:58,340
There's people right here.

1247
01:44:01,260 --> 01:44:02,380
What do

1248
01:44:05,480 --> 01:44:06,780
you mean?

1249
01:44:06,800 --> 01:44:08,120
They seem so nice.

1250
01:44:08,400 --> 01:44:09,480
Vault Tech was prepared.

1251
01:44:12,620 --> 01:44:13,260
You see this?

1252
01:44:14,120 --> 01:44:20,660
The cooking station, the stash box, the workbenches all
built with the camp.

1253
01:44:21,680 --> 01:44:23,260
You need a home base out there.

1254
01:44:23,900 --> 01:44:27,840
The construction and assembly mobile platform is designed to
give you one.

1255
01:44:28,540 --> 01:44:29,780
Just add resources,

1256
01:44:33,020 --> 01:44:34,860
There was no NPCs before it.

1257
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:36,960
There was no NPCs?

1258
01:44:37,060 --> 01:44:39,140
You guys just didn't understand Todd's vision.

1259
01:44:40,500 --> 01:44:43,580
That's what people hated the most about MMOs.

1260
01:44:44,140 --> 01:44:45,540
There was no NPCs.

1261
01:44:47,680 --> 01:44:49,580
Like, I mean, there was too many NPCs.

1262
01:44:49,880 --> 01:44:53,240
There was too many NPCs and MMOs.

1263
01:44:53,640 --> 01:44:55,440
So Todd knew what we wanted.

1264
01:44:56,200 --> 01:44:57,980
But after seeing Appalachia for myself.

1265
01:44:58,140 --> 01:44:58,920
It just works.

1266
01:45:00,620 --> 01:45:03,960
The president of 76 has a safe haven they can start from.

1267
01:45:07,880 --> 01:45:08,340
Alright.

1268
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:12,140
I always feel like she stopped talking, and then she kept
going.

1269
01:45:17,640 --> 01:45:18,220
Alright.

1270
01:45:18,480 --> 01:45:18,760
Nice.

1271
01:45:19,400 --> 01:45:21,000
Okay, let me...

1272
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:24,320
Apparently, there's, like, copyrighted music, so I'll go
with classical.

1273
01:45:26,100 --> 01:45:29,140
There's never any copyrighted classical music.

1274
01:45:32,400 --> 01:45:36,800
Alright, we gotta go kill a camp.

1275
01:45:38,100 --> 01:45:46,980
When you set up a camp, camp okay i want oh i'm level three

I'm safe.

1279
01:46:10,680 --> 01:46:10,800
All right.

1280
01:46:11,260 --> 01:46:11,260
All right.

1281
01:46:11,320 --> 01:46:12,720
I'll give a speech, guys.

1282
01:46:13,260 --> 01:46:15,240
I'm going to give a speech, everybody.

1283
01:46:18,200 --> 01:46:19,920
Welcome to the team.

1284
01:46:20,520 --> 01:46:22,760
Welcome to the Dokiman's team, everyone.

1285
01:46:23,600 --> 01:46:28,140
I am very happy that to have all of you here as my...

1286
01:46:28,140 --> 01:46:29,660
Oh, my God!

1287
01:46:34,560 --> 01:46:36,320
Good job, everybody.

1288
01:46:37,100 --> 01:46:39,180
Now it's time to do a mission.

1289
01:46:40,320 --> 01:46:48,040
There's no I in team, but everybody remembered that I get
all 99% of the credit.

1290
01:46:48,160 --> 01:46:48,680
No, you know what?

1291
01:46:48,700 --> 01:46:55,220
No, I get 100% of the credit, just like my Oshi Thomas
Edison.

1292
01:46:55,880 --> 01:47:02,280
Because even, just remember, you're all doing this under the
name of Doki Bird.

1293
01:47:02,800 --> 01:47:10,300
So everything you do has the honor of taking, of having the
crew.

Todd was right.

1429
01:57:46,910 --> 01:57:50,470
Bro, this is bigger than your actual house, man.

1430
01:57:51,550 --> 01:57:53,850
Why do you have a bed outside?

1431
01:57:54,270 --> 01:57:55,630
Bro, is this for the homies?

1432
01:57:55,770 --> 01:57:58,170
Like a sleepover party for the homies?

1433
01:57:58,590 --> 01:58:00,070
The hot tub street.

1434
01:58:01,910 --> 01:58:06,930
Bro, the man cave is bigger than your actual home.

1435
01:58:09,110 --> 01:58:25,290
where is the gamer room oh my god this is actually crazy

This is actually a sick crib, bro.

1438
01:58:40,330 --> 01:58:42,830
This guy has his own vault.

1439
01:58:43,870 --> 01:58:46,610
He has his priorities right.

1440
01:58:48,610 --> 01:58:50,210
What a fucking collection.

1441
01:58:50,950 --> 01:58:58,330
I think the most impressive thing is that we load it into a
server that has this person's home.

1442
01:58:58,910 --> 01:59:00,030
Like, we...

1443
01:59:00,930 --> 01:59:03,190

01:59:03,710 --> 01:59:04,710

1452
02:00:12,470 --> 02:00:25,030

He is optimized.

1581
02:11:06,710 --> 02:11:09,350

1582
02:11:09,510 --> 02:11:12,750

difficult i had a little like a little delay because we were

1926
02:38:49,890 --> 02:38:57,470

got you know side a sidetracked a little that's like their

1927
02:38:57,470 --> 02:39:09,530
headquartered at west virginia company fantastic so that's
where their boss will be you just need to Wait, wait, wait.

1928
02:39:09,730 --> 02:39:10,710
West Virginia lumber?

1929
02:39:11,510 --> 02:39:12,310
Yeah, West Virginia.

1930
02:39:12,770 --> 02:39:14,070
You misheard them for sure.

1931
02:39:14,630 --> 02:39:15,910
And that's of concern.

1932
02:39:16,470 --> 02:39:17,550
Why exactly?

1933
02:39:18,650 --> 02:39:21,070
Was wandering up that way not too far back.

1934
02:39:21,670 --> 02:39:27,890
The lumber company, that place was overrun with a bunch of
those big green bastards, mutants.

1935
02:39:28,750 --> 02:39:30,770
You've seen those Frankensteins.

1936
02:39:31,090 --> 02:39:37,570
If this gang was able to clean those things out of the mill,
that just, these guys might be tougher than advertised.

1937
02:39:38,490 --> 02:39:46,570
tougher you got any recommendations on how you'd proceed
well i wouldn't go in guns blazing unless you got some big

1938
02:39:46,570 --> 02:39:51,630
guns oh i have some big guns more don't you worry

1939
02:39:59,490 --> 02:40:09,190
oh we definitely got some big guns wouldn't be a bad idea to
check in with either of them All right.

1940
02:40:10,470 --> 02:40:12,230
Tell me about this family.

1941
02:40:12,830 --> 02:40:16,990
You'll find them at Anchor Farm if these thugs haven't
already run them off.

1942
02:40:17,310 --> 02:40:22,270
But if they are still there, well, they probably managed to
work something out with them.

1943
02:40:22,530 --> 02:40:24,750
Hey, it couldn't hurt to find out what it was.

1944
02:40:25,330 --> 02:40:25,750
All right.

1945
02:40:26,850 --> 02:40:27,770
What about the scrapper?

1946
02:40:28,090 --> 02:40:28,410
What about the scrapper?

1947
02:40:28,410 --> 02:40:30,050
The stall is at Tyler County Fairground.

1948
02:40:30,690 --> 02:40:33,690
Guy kept claiming you knew the best way to run the mutants
out of the mill.

1949
02:40:34,130 --> 02:40:36,410
But, listen, I couldn't get him this, Bilhau.

1950
02:40:36,630 --> 02:40:38,470
Probably have a better chance he'll share what he loves.

1951
02:40:38,490 --> 02:40:42,350
learn with someone who still has an entire face.

1952
02:40:43,130 --> 02:40:45,350
Oh, he's like racist to ghouls.

1953
02:40:45,570 --> 02:40:46,430
Well, that's a good thing.

1954
02:40:46,870 --> 02:40:48,270
Because that's all I've got.

1955
02:40:48,770 --> 02:40:55,510
If you haven't already explored up that way, the fastest
route back would be via Vault 76 and trekking north from

1956
02:40:55,510 --> 02:40:55,850
there.

1957
02:40:56,170 --> 02:40:57,250
And take care of yourself, alright?

1958
02:40:57,690 --> 02:40:58,790
You're doing us a big one here.

1959
02:40:58,790 --> 02:40:59,290

02:48:14,930 --> 02:48:15,410
We're okay.

2072
02:48:15,810 --> 02:48:16,650
Guys, we're okay.

02:48:17,470 --> 02:48:19,050
We're safe, guys.

2074
02:48:20,190 --> 02:48:21,130
Holy fuck.

2075
02:48:21,830 --> 02:48:24,510
Who fucking did they send it?

2076
02:48:25,090 --> 02:48:26,650
Can they send nukes?

2077
02:48:27,390 --> 02:48:28,690
Oh my god.

2078
02:48:30,970 --> 02:48:33,010
Someone did the funniest.

02:48:33,450 --> 02:48:34,250
We'll be fine.

2080
02:48:34,870 --> 02:48:36,070
We'll be okay.

2081
02:48:38,330 --> 02:48:40,930
You can send it nukes.

2082
02:48:50,570 --> 02:48:54,670
Oh my god, I can't believe it.

2083
02:48:55,370 --> 02:48:59,410
I can't believe somebody sent in a fucking nuke.

2084
02:49:01,770 --> 02:49:07,430
I told you, this is exactly why I am not turning on PvP.

2085
02:49:08,090 --> 02:49:10,610
This is exactly why.

Chat, I told you.

2087
02:49:18,530 --> 02:49:23,430
Dude, those poor level ones that just came out of the vault.

2088
02:49:25,990 --> 02:49:28,210
They just had to make sure.

2089
02:49:28,470 --> 02:49:29,590
This is where they live.

2090
02:49:31,010 --> 02:49:32,910
I think this is where they live, right?

2091
02:49:33,750 --> 02:49:34,830

I had a great time.

2641
03:26:26,720 --> 03:26:30,440
I don't think I, like we did much of the actual lore of this
game.

2642
03:26:34,660 --> 03:26:38,040
I don't think we did much of the lore of this game.

But I still had a great time.

Fallout 4 in the future Because it has been a really fun

help me.
