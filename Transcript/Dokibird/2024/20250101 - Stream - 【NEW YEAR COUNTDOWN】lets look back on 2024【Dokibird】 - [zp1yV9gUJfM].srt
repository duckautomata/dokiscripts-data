00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:53,870
🎵 Everybody!

2
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:55,770
Hello, hello!

3
00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:58,070
Oh my god, I just realized.

4
00:01:58,250 --> 00:01:59,150
Okay, let me move.

5
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:03,090
Let me- HAHAHAHA Let me move the cam down below.

6
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:09,610
I realized, like, I realized the cat that got, like, I realized that dad got, like, Mike Wazowski's there.

7
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:12,910
HAHAHAHA Hello, everybody!

8
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:21,670
Happy New Year to the people who are on the other side of the world, or in the middle of the world, or, like, any other side of the world that's a right or central, or, like, east coast.

9
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:22,970
It's just west coast.

10
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:25,250
I'm here for west coasters right now.

11
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:27,130
For a New Year countdown.

12
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:28,530
Yes, dad's here!

13
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:30,970
He's wearing his little New Year glasses!

14
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:34,870
I'm super excited to welcome 2025 of all you guys.

15
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:36,810
I wasn't able to do that last year.

16
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:41,090
So I'm happy to be here to welcome you guys to the new year!

17
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:42,810
Um, so, yeah!

18
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:51,210
Um, so the plan is we're gonna be doing a year in review because what a fucking- what a year.

19
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:52,390
What about MST?

20
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:57,050
Okay, what about- HAHAHAHA I'm sorry.

21
00:02:57,550 --> 00:03:00,210
Um, the people in the mountains.

22
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:09,370
I'm sorry, but you guys- you guys don't exist in my- HAHAHA There's only cent- west, central, and east.

23
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:12,270
Uh, there's always been three.

24
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:15,010
I don't know what you're talking about when you mean mountains.

25
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:19,490
It's like we eliminated, um, airbending.

26
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:21,230
There's always been three.

27
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:23,530
Fire, earth, and water.

28
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:26,190
I don't know what you're talking about, airbending.

29
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:32,790
HAHAHA Nothing else exists, um, in America.

30
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:36,450
West- west, central, and east.

31
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:40,650
Um, anyway guys, what a year.

32
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:43,590
Um, what a fucking year.

33
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:46,090
Also, for those who, uh, don't follow my Twitter.

34
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:49,770
Um, I did, uh- oh my gosh, I need to update my community post.

35
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:57,530
That reminds me, I need to do my community post because, like, there's so many posts I should have made on my community post that I haven't yet because I keep forgetting to.

36
00:03:57,710 --> 00:04:03,110
I need to, like, hire a staff member to help me write some of these, like, sponsored posts.

37
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:17,650
Not hire, but, like, delegate it to one of my staff members to remember to make sponsored community posts for me because I haven't- I realized I haven't, like, talked about my nendoroid on my community post yet or, like, other stuff.

38
00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:22,970
So, like, I need to remember to delegate, uh, to delegate it to other staff members.

39
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:26,090
Um, that's what my new year's resolution.

40
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:31,270
Uh, well, it's more so, like, nendoroids and stuff like that to, like, advertise it on my community post.

41
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:32,770
Be like, hey guys, remember my nendoroid?

42
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:33,530
It's up for pre-order!

43
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:34,750
And all of that stuff.

44
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:38,490
So I need to remember to- I don't even know if my mods could do that.

45
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:41,010
I'm pretty sure, like, if- I don't know, actually.

46
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:49,170
I don't know if they have the power to, like, write community posts for me when it comes to, like, sponsored content, sponsored stuff or, like, just, like, anything else.

47
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:51,350
Um, thank you, thank you for the superchat!

48
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:54,530
Thank you, thank you for getting or just playing my- Also, that too.

49
00:04:54,930 --> 00:05:01,110
Um, I cannot wait till the season's over for Marvel Rivals so I can focus again back on my career.

50
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:10,790
So, like, my issue right now is that I get- I get so obsessive over one thing that, like, everything else just doesn't exist for me.

51
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:23,010
So, like, also, by the way, um, the reason why my schedule isn't out yet is that I'm still sort of, like, low-key on, like, a little R&R as in I'm sort of using my R&R to just play Marvel Rivals.

52
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:31,910
And speaking of Marvel Rivals, tomorrow we're gonna be doing, uh, another not stopping until we're top 500 in Marvel Rivals.

53
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:38,170
So, that means tomorrow we're gonna be playing with Mace again tomorrow.

54
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:43,730
Um, and did you know Mace was one of the people that helped Shroud get top 500?

55
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:48,030
I- I'm basically Shroud!

56
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:49,410
Let's go!

57
00:05:52,790 --> 00:06:00,670
Anyway, anyway, anyway, so, uh, tomorrow we're gonna be playing- I don't know who the third- we're planning a, uh, three stack.

58
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:07,270
Um, because apparently that's- apparently- I know I said it before that all pro- like, everybody in the higher elo, they all stack.

59
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:09,710
And apparently, that's literally what they all do.

60
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:18,870
Everybody in the top 200, they all just three to four stack, um, to get better to- because, like, apparently you can't even get games.

61
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:23,050
You can't get games if you're solo duo, if you're high elo.

62
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:27,850
Cause the- cause, like, it takes a really, really long time.

63
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:32,350
Anyway, we're gonna- I'm gonna be looking for a third DPS player to play with us too.

64
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:34,010
So whoever's gonna be awake at that time.

65
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:39,170
Cause I feel like tank support- tank support DPS is, like, the perfect trio.

66
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:47,690
Um, so, uh, yeah, so anyway, um, uh, okay, I have a funny story to tell you guys.

67
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:52,130
But before I tell you the funny story about my arrivals, I got a funny dad update today.

68
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:59,010
So, like, uh, today I was walking dad during, uh, like, basically, like, 20 minutes ago.

69
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:02,870
I was walking Doki Amber Doge, uh, 20 minutes ago.

70
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:15,310
And because I was like, uh, cause I was like, you know, usually, okay, uh, because of my schedule, this is the- I usually walk him at, like, midnight or, like, 11pm.

71
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:17,970
And- or, like, I mean, it's around that.

72
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:24,610
I usually walk him around, like, 10 to 1 for his, like, late night P's- P sessions.

73
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:26,710
Because, like, I stream at 5.

74
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:31,510
So, like, I- I- I realize, like, it's easier to just walk him for the late nights.

75
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:36,110
And then I would walk- like, I would do, like, 2 to 3 sessions of walking for him.

76
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:38,130
So, like, yeah, this is basically it.

77
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:41,570
Anyway, uh, because of my streaming- because of my work stuff.

78
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:47,390
Anyway, um, today, like, 20 minutes ago, I took him out for a walk.

79
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:49,990
And there was a dog smaller than him.

80
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:55,550
So, you know how he was like- you know how he's like, if a dog's smaller than me, then I don't fucking care?

81
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:57,530
Like, that's- that's basically dad.

82
00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:01,090
He's like, I don't care if you're smaller than me, then I'm the alpha.

83
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:05,090
So, and- but if you're bigger than me, then I fucking hate you.

84
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:09,010
So, there was a small dog in front of me, right?

85
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:09,930
And he was so excited.

86
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:11,970
He's like, finally, a dog that's smaller than me.

87
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:13,490
Because he's a wiener dog, you know?

88
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:16,210
Like, wiener- there's not a lot of dogs that are smaller than a wiener dog.

89
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:19,350
And so, he walked up to him.

90
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:20,170
He was so excited.

91
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:24,070
He was like, finally, another dog that's smaller than me.

92
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:25,750
And so, he walked up to them.

93
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:26,630
They smelled each other.

94
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:30,690
But then the smaller dog is like, who the fuck are you?

95
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:37,090
So, the smaller dog is just like my dog.

96
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:40,310
Where if he sees a dog that's bigger than him, he's not happy.

97
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:46,090
So, you know, don't you ever do it.

98
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:46,790
He, like, walked up.

99
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:48,590
He's like, I can't wait to smell you.

100
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:49,870
Smell your butt.

101
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:51,870
He was like, you know, sniff.

102
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:54,970
And then the smaller dog was like, what the fuck are you doing?

103
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:55,750
What are you doing?

104
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:58,850
And he, like, tried to bite my dog.

105
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:04,050
And then, obviously, dad was like, what the fuck?

106
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:08,130
And he's like, oh, yeah.

107
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:09,650
He's like, I don't like this.

108
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:15,550
And he's about to bite the other dog.

109
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:21,150
And obviously, me and the other one quickly pulled them away from each other.

110
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:22,290
And it was crazy.

111
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:24,030
Okay, this is the crazy part.

112
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:24,950
This is the...

113
00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:26,930
So, usually, he doesn't like...

114
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:32,810
Okay, so Doki Amber Doge doesn't like to pee on objects.

115
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:37,290
Like, you know how, like, other dogs, they pee on fire hydrants and, like, lights.

116
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:44,070
And, like, you know, some dogs like to pee on items for, like, territory markings.

117
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:48,410
And the thing is, Doki Amber Doge doesn't do that.

118
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:52,990
I've never seen him pee on an object before.

119
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:54,950
Until today.

120
00:09:54,950 --> 00:10:05,930
Because after he had this little fight with the tiny dog, he, like, walked over to, like, this lamppost that was close by.

121
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:11,190
And then looked him in the eye and just peed on the lamppost.

122
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:19,670
It, like, blew my mind.

123
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:21,610
Because I was like, that's not grass.

124
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:25,050
Because he would always, he would only pee on grass before.

125
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:32,550
So this is the first time I've ever seen him pee on an object.

126
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:36,010
Because he was trying to, like, assert dominance.

127
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:38,710
And he's like, this is mine.

128
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:49,570
The fact that he, like, looked at the other dog while he peed on that lamppost.

129
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:53,850
This is my object.

130
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:57,290
You trying to fucking fight me?

131
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:03,310
Also, attention, happy new year over there.

132
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:04,930
We had a great new year.

133
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:09,150
No, he didn't pee on the other small dog this time.

134
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:12,610
Mr. Fish, thank you for your super chat.

135
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:13,270
Thank you, thank you.

136
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:14,650
Happy new year, DokiDragos.

137
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:15,910
Thank you, thank you for the super chat.

138
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:16,790
Thank you, thank you.

139
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:19,250
All Separation, thank you for the super chat.

140
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:20,390
Thank you, thank you.

141
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:23,670
Why are Madness like this?

142
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:27,190
He has a little Napoleon complex, that's for sure.

143
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:28,270
Thank you for the super chat.

144
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:29,350
Thank you, thank you.

145
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:35,610
But yes, also, like I said, the Dragoon, for those who dropped their Dragoon sonas on Twitter.

146
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:38,790
I'm so sorry if you didn't make it in.

147
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:47,110
Because I was fucking copying and pasting Dragoons into this little compilation for five hours.

148
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:55,670
I was doing it for like four to five hours.

149
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:59,010
So I'm really sorry if you didn't make it in.

150
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:06,170
I think I have like around 100 to 150 Dragoons that made it in.

151
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:07,870
But I'm so sorry.

152
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:12,010
But don't worry, because I do this every year.

153
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:18,110
So if you're not in it for this year, you'll be in it for next year, maybe.

154
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:19,830
It depends on if I can put more.

155
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:20,710
It depends.

156
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:25,410
But I'll try my best to put you there next year.

157
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:27,830
Because there was a lot.

158
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:29,950
There was a lot.

159
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:34,870
But I try my best to fit in as many Dragoons as possible.

160
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:36,150
So it's more like...

161
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:38,790
I hope you guys will find yourself in.

162
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:41,830
I hope you guys find yourself if you do make it in.

163
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:44,110
But I'll try my best to do...

164
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:51,470
I'll try my best to include as many as I can for next year as well.

165
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:53,150
Thank you for the super chat.

166
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:53,430
Thank you.

167
00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:53,790
Thank you.

168
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:55,290
Happy New Year, Doki!

169
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:56,590
Happy New Year!

170
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:59,390
We made it to another year!

171
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:03,050
Also, thank you for two gifted chests.

172
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:03,350
Thank you.

173
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:03,930
Thank you.

174
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:06,690
And welcome to Tomato Farm.

175
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:07,190
Welcome, welcome.

176
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:08,550
Okay, I need to show you guys this.

177
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:12,650
Okay, so I did play a little bit of Marvel Rivals, but I didn't play on my main account.

178
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:18,410
Because I was planning on doing a long session tomorrow.

179
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:21,930
So we're gonna do a session where we don't end until we're top 500.

180
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:27,430
And I was helping Mace rank up another account.

181
00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:29,590
Because apparently, his...

182
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:31,390
You know how he used his...

183
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:34,030
You know how he was on his alt account?

184
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:35,830
Doobie, I'm drunk right now.

185
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:37,810
But can you shout out my boyfriend, Driver?

186
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:39,350
Because I'm drunk and gay.

187
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:42,850
Positive, thank you for your very first super chat.

188
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:49,010
I'm not Doobie, but...

189
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:53,350
I don't even think I can, like, imitate her voice, to be fair.

190
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:55,890
To be fair, she has a unique voice.

191
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:59,350
I don't, but like...

192
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:01,610
Shout out to your boyfriend, Driver.

193
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:05,110
If he's also watching this stream as well.

194
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:08,330
He's a little confused.

195
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:10,370
But he's got the spirit.

196
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:16,510
Is Doobie even live right now?

197
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:17,290
Let me check.

198
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:18,050
I don't even know.

199
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:19,850
Is Doobie live doing a new year stream?

200
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:23,130
I don't know.

201
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:26,030
But like, I hope...

202
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:30,250
I hope your boyfriend is also watching.

203
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:31,230
Oh, she is?

204
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:33,190
Oh, she just went live on Twitch.

205
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:34,230
Oh!

206
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:35,650
Oh, I see.

207
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:36,130
Alright.

208
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:36,290
Okay.

209
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:37,450
But yeah.

210
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:39,570
Shout out to your boyfriend.

211
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:42,990
Thank you for your very first super chat.

212
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:43,550
Thank you, thank you.

213
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:44,170
Okay, anyway.

214
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:45,110
I got distracted.

215
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:49,570
Anyway, so, I was hoping Maze would rank up his...

216
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:50,730
Another account.

217
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:54,130
So that I would be GM in time to be GM.

218
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:55,610
Because, like...

219
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:58,130
The account that he used to play with me...

220
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:00,350
Is now rank 80.

221
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:01,710
So, like...

222
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:02,750
He's saying, like...

223
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:03,390
Oh yeah, no.

224
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:07,330
The queues are gonna be absolutely, incredibly long.

225
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:08,150
If, like...

226
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:11,370
Because apparently, people who are top 100...

227
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:13,290
People who are top 100...

228
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:14,410
Are like...

229
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:17,130
Queues are like 2 plus hours now.

230
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:18,650
Like, for one game.

231
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:23,030
It's like 1 to 2 hours to even get one game.

232
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:24,470
If you're top 100.

233
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:27,270
So...

234
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:28,710
So, like...

235
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:29,470
I was like...

236
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:30,710
I'm not doing that on stream.

237
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:33,470
I'm not waiting an hour to get into a game.

238
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:34,710
I'm like...

239
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:37,330
I was literally...

240
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:38,550
I was watching...

241
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:42,390
I was watching the stream of this group.

242
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:43,750
That's top 10.

243
00:15:43,930 --> 00:15:45,390
This is basically top 10 stack.

244
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:47,510
So, it was like rank 2.

245
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:49,930
It was like the top 10 players.

246
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:51,290
They were in a 4 stack.

247
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:52,750
I was watching their stream.

248
00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:54,130
Because I really wanted to learn from them.

249
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:55,810
And their queues...

250
00:15:55,810 --> 00:15:59,230
Their queue time was 2 and a half hours.

251
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:00,090
And...

252
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:02,210
I was like...

253
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:06,150
And apparently, they got into a game with someone.

254
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:08,330
And then, they got them again.

255
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:10,250
They got into a game with one of them.

256
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:12,270
And then, with this random...

257
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:13,270
Because it was a 4 stack.

258
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:14,350
So, they got 2 randoms.

259
00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:15,310
So, like...

260
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:17,190
They got them again.

261
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:19,410
And then, the random was like...

262
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:22,770
I played 7 games in between your 2 hour queue.

263
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:29,090
I was just like...

264
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:30,770
That's so fucked.

265
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:33,210
Like...

266
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:36,390
The random got to play 7 games.

267
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:38,370
And then, they got a queue.

268
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:42,330
So, anyway.

269
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:43,270
So, yes.

270
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:45,450
I was helping Mace rank up.

271
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:46,390
Because I was on my alt.

272
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:48,910
One of my lower rank alt accounts too.

273
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:51,970
To help speed the rank up session.

274
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:53,090
So, it's like easier.

275
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:55,130
So, um...

276
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:56,230
So, I pumped...

277
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:59,270
I was on my NotDokiBird account.

278
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:02,690
And I need to show you guys this.

279
00:17:05,070 --> 00:17:06,970
So, I was on my...

280
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:10,050
I don't even know if this person is here right now.

281
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:10,990
But like...

282
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:14,810
But...

283
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:16,030
But...

284
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:18,810
I was on my NotDokiBird account.

285
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:20,850
And somebody like...

286
00:17:20,850 --> 00:17:23,210
Obviously, was like...

287
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:24,750
Whoa, NotDokiBird.

288
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:27,370
There's no way that's DokiBird.

289
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:31,430
So...

290
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:32,610
So...

291
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:33,750
This is what they said.

292
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:35,190
They were like...

293
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:36,050
Okay, give me a sec.

294
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:37,030
I need to like...

295
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:37,710
I need...

296
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:38,810
I need to grab this.

297
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:40,510
This is what they said.

298
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:43,610
Alright.

299
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:44,550
So, first up.

300
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:45,710
This starts off normal.

301
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:47,230
They were like...

302
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:49,510
When the DPS good, now you're good.

303
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:49,870
Thanks.

304
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:51,430
I was on DPS, by the way.

305
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:52,610
So, like, I was carrying.

306
00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:53,810
And I was like...

307
00:17:53,810 --> 00:17:54,090
Nah.

308
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:55,230
Now you're good.

309
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:55,790
Thanks.

310
00:17:55,970 --> 00:17:57,050
I'm a support main.

311
00:17:57,390 --> 00:17:58,330
Good team around.

312
00:17:58,650 --> 00:18:00,730
And it starts off normal, right?

313
00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:02,690
Anyway...

314
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:07,370
Wait, no.

315
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:07,730
Sorry.

316
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:09,430
This is not the right image I want to show.

317
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:10,930
Anyway, this one.

318
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:13,310
Solid heals.

319
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:15,330
Just a good team all around.

320
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:18,790
Also, very surprised to see a Doki mention in Rivals.

321
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:22,150
She's been brainwashed like crazy.

322
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:26,710
Oh, man.

323
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:27,570
He doesn't know.

324
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:29,930
He thinks I'm actually not Doki Bird.

325
00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:31,410
That can't be Doki Bird.

326
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:34,550
It clearly says not Doki Bird.

327
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:38,190
Little did they know.

328
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:39,790
So, there's like...

329
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:40,150
Yeah.

330
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:41,490
And then...

331
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:44,070
Yeah, that clearly was not Doki Bird.

332
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:46,670
And then, obviously, right after.

333
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:48,770
Nice playing with my fellow Dragoon.

334
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:49,770
Thanks.

335
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:50,990
I love his streams.

336
00:18:56,650 --> 00:18:59,470
I can't believe my name worked.

337
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:05,670
People lie on the internet?

338
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:08,050
Wow.

339
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:09,610
They're like...

340
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:12,790
I mean, it clearly says it's not Doki Bird.

341
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:14,930
So, how could it be Doki Bird?

342
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:17,550
It works.

343
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:20,130
My disguise works, guys!

344
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:23,890
Hey, Doki.

345
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:24,990
Sorry for calling you doobie.

346
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:26,750
I'm drunk and gay.

347
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:27,350
Drunk.

348
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:30,630
Can you say Chester loves his boyfriend?

349
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:31,910
I like how he's like...

350
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:35,430
Not only is he drunk, he's gay and drunk.

351
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:37,430
Aren't you originally gay?

352
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:38,690
Like...

353
00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:40,710
I thought...

354
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:41,730
You're already gay.

355
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:43,250
How does drinking make you...

356
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:45,190
You make it more ultra gay?

357
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:47,310
Thank you for the super chat.

358
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:47,750
Pause it.

359
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:48,770
Thank you, thank you.

360
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:51,650
Hello, thank you for the super chat.

361
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:52,750
Thank you, thank you.

362
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:54,850
Ready for another amazing year?

363
00:19:56,290 --> 00:19:57,830
Had a concussion a few weeks ago...

364
00:19:57,830 --> 00:20:00,630
But I'm still able to watch your streams from...

365
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:01,110
Oh, thanks.

366
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:01,930
Bow bow.

367
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:03,930
Thank you for the super chat.

368
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:05,210
Thank you, thank you.

369
00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:08,570
Yasmin, thank you for the akasupa.

370
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:10,050
Thank you, thank you.

371
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:11,730
Happy new year, Doki Bird.

372
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:13,530
I'm really happy to meet you in four years.

373
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:15,230
Happy 2025.

374
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:16,950
Thank you for the akasupa.

375
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:18,370
Thank you, thank you.

376
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:21,710
That was the deepest bow bow.

377
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:27,810
Thank you for the akasupa.

378
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:29,250
Thank you, thank you.

379
00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:31,510
Happy new year from Central Town, Doki.

380
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:32,850
I hope one day to meet again.

381
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:34,370
I'm going to agree, but now I just want to say...

382
00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:36,610
I'm so proud of you for such a miraculous year.

383
00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:38,730
So much, and it's not an exaggeration.

384
00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:41,750
And to say you saved my life during this shitty year.

385
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:42,550
Thank you for the akasupa.

386
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,730
Thank you, thank you.

387
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:46,110
I really appreciate it.

388
00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:47,310
Thank you so much.

389
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:49,800
But yes, definitely...

390
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:55,710
Definitely has been an insane year.

391
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:57,910
Lots of...

392
00:20:57,910 --> 00:20:58,410
A lot...

393
00:20:58,410 --> 00:20:59,650
It started off with downs.

394
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:03,130
But then, like, we just couldn't stop winning.

395
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:05,170
That I legitimately, like...

396
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:07,690
I've lost track of, like...

397
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:10,650
There's too much stuff happening at that point.

398
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:12,710
It was so...

399
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:13,350
I'm, like...

400
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:15,070
I'm legitimately, like...

401
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:16,150
Super...

402
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:17,310
I guess, like...

403
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:19,610
Overwhelmed with everything going on.

404
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:24,590
It was so many stuff going on that I can't even keep track of things anymore.

405
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:28,750
I was, like, asking one of my mods to help me, like...

406
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:30,490
Write down everything that happened.

407
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:32,810
But I honestly feel like...

408
00:21:32,810 --> 00:21:35,710
At this point, I might need your help to help me, like...

409
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:38,870
Remember all the stuff that's happened throughout the year.

410
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:42,570
Because so many things happened throughout this year.

411
00:21:42,650 --> 00:21:45,910
And I feel like I am so behind on a lot.

412
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:49,070
It didn't help that I have a fucking unhealthy addiction right now.

413
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:50,290
No, I need to share.

414
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:52,330
This addiction is very unhealthy.

415
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:55,250
But it ends after the first season is over.

416
00:21:55,670 --> 00:21:57,490
It literally ends after that.

417
00:21:57,690 --> 00:21:58,870
And then I'll be back to normal.

418
00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:00,370
I just want to be the first...

419
00:22:00,370 --> 00:22:01,570
The first one.

420
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:05,090
I want to be the first VTuber to, like...

421
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:07,230
The highest ranked VTuber...

422
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:08,650
In Top 500.

423
00:22:09,330 --> 00:22:12,570
And that's my goal.

424
00:22:12,890 --> 00:22:14,230
And then I stop after that.

425
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:16,530
Just like how in Overwatch 2...

426
00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:20,330
I was the highest ranked VTuber in Overwatch 2...

427
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:21,410
When it first came out.

428
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:22,350
And then I stopped caring.

429
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:28,970
That's really it.

430
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:30,110
So, like...

431
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:31,970
After that, I'm done.

432
00:22:32,610 --> 00:22:33,670
I'll be okay.

433
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:37,070
So, that's really all I want.

434
00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:58,350
Yeah, I just want that flex.

435
00:22:58,570 --> 00:22:58,970
Honestly.

436
00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:00,250
Alright.

437
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:05,490
Highest ranked full-time VTuber that doesn't flesh tube.

438
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:06,510
Bam.

439
00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:12,330
The pure VTuber form.

440
00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:13,250
There you go.

441
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:15,170
Alright, smart asses.

442
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:17,050
If you want me to be specific there.

443
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:19,250
Like, if you want me...

444
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:22,030
If you want me to be fucking specific.

445
00:23:25,890 --> 00:23:26,730
Okay.

446
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:29,350
That's oddly specific.

447
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:32,670
Anyway.

448
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:37,710
I actually asked one of my mods...

449
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:41,730
I asked one of my mods if they could make me a...

450
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:43,190
Do you know how I asked you guys for clips?

451
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:46,590
So, I asked one of my mods to grab an editor...

452
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:48,370
To help me compile some of the clips.

453
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:49,610
I haven't watched the compilation.

454
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:52,790
So, I'm gonna watch it blind with you guys.

455
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:54,030
Just to go...

456
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:55,970
It's like a small mini year-end review.

457
00:23:56,190 --> 00:23:57,610
It's like 20 minutes long.

458
00:23:57,610 --> 00:24:00,590
So, we're just gonna look through 20 minutes.

459
00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:04,550
20 minutes of some of my best moments.

460
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:07,530
In the last year.

461
00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:08,630
So, I honestly...

462
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:09,610
I didn't watch it.

463
00:24:09,810 --> 00:24:12,390
It was built from your suggestions.

464
00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:15,950
So, I honestly don't know what's in it.

465
00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:17,010
So, what they included.

466
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:18,950
I know they said they included 20 clips.

467
00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:20,630
That's all I know.

468
00:24:20,910 --> 00:24:21,790
They included 20 clips.

469
00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:23,550
Which is not a lot if you think about it.

470
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:24,850
For an entire year.

471
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:26,090
But they were like...

472
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:27,150
Yeah, we included more.

473
00:24:27,150 --> 00:24:28,050
It'll just be...

474
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:29,070
It'll just take way too long.

475
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:35,730
So, I'm super interested to see what they included.

476
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:37,510
Chi, thank you for the super chat.

477
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:38,230
Thank you, thank you.

478
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:39,790
When I saw your scheduled tweet today.

479
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:42,670
I was wondering if you rotted your brain so much you forgot your concert.

480
00:24:42,970 --> 00:24:45,670
Just a bit where you played Rivals on stage.

481
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:46,450
Thank you for the super chat.

482
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:47,310
Thank you, thank you.

483
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:48,810
Okay, so you guys didn't know.

484
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:51,610
I scheduled a tweet.

485
00:24:53,130 --> 00:24:54,670
In the beginning of the year.

486
00:24:54,670 --> 00:24:56,230
In like February.

487
00:24:57,430 --> 00:25:01,410
Where my dream was to one day.

488
00:25:01,570 --> 00:25:03,090
One of my goals and dreams.

489
00:25:03,490 --> 00:25:05,770
Was to one day do a 3D concert.

490
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:07,290
And like perform for you guys.

491
00:25:07,650 --> 00:25:08,990
What I didn't realize is that.

492
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:11,710
I didn't realize I forgot to delete that scheduled tweet.

493
00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:19,810
I didn't realize I forgot to delete that scheduled tweet.

494
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:22,830
So it went live like today.

495
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:24,810
At like 1pm.

496
00:25:25,710 --> 00:25:26,930
So I woke up.

497
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:29,690
And like obviously I checked my Twitter notification.

498
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:31,970
And then I was like wait a minute.

499
00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:32,850
Oh my god.

500
00:25:32,890 --> 00:25:33,730
And then I see like you know.

501
00:25:33,810 --> 00:25:35,330
My mutual is liking the tweet.

502
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:36,570
And I was like wait up.

503
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:37,310
Oh my god.

504
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:38,710
Oh that's so awkward.

505
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:39,630
Cause then people were like.

506
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:41,770
Didn't you just do a 3D concert?

507
00:25:44,570 --> 00:25:48,590
Cause I didn't think I would get a 3D concert this year.

508
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:50,770
I never in my life would have.

509
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:52,730
Cause I felt like that was so fast.

510
00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:53,310
You know like.

511
00:25:53,870 --> 00:25:55,490
You know February Doki.

512
00:25:55,630 --> 00:25:57,310
Would not have expected it to happen.

513
00:25:57,570 --> 00:25:58,450
This soon.

514
00:25:58,890 --> 00:25:59,170
So.

515
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:02,430
Cause usually 3D takes a long time.

516
00:26:02,550 --> 00:26:03,050
And then like.

517
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:04,230
You know I'm not a singer.

518
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:05,070
I'm not a dancer.

519
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:07,990
So like I never expected to even be offered.

520
00:26:08,290 --> 00:26:09,170
To do a concert.

521
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:10,670
Especially as an indie.

522
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:12,150
So.

523
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:14,830
So I never like.

524
00:26:15,210 --> 00:26:17,070
Thought that that was gonna happen for me.

525
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:17,670
So.

526
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:18,690
Honestly.

527
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:20,050
I just didn't think.

528
00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:22,010
I just forgot to delete the schedule tweet.

529
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:22,510
I didn't even.

530
00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:23,070
I honestly.

531
00:26:23,370 --> 00:26:23,850
I don't even.

532
00:26:23,930 --> 00:26:24,430
I forgot.

533
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:26,690
I didn't even make that schedule tweet.

534
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:28,210
Until it showed up.

535
00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:30,750
Cause I would have deleted

536
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:36,040
it ages ago.

537
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:37,320
After.

538
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,860
After finding out I was doing a concert.

539
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,560
But it just like showed up.

540
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:49,040
Kyle.

541
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,040
Thank you for the super chat.

542
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:50,340
Thank you.

543
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:50,900
Thank you.

544
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:51,580
Merry Christmas.

545
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:52,540
You filthy animal.

546
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:53,620
And happy new year.

547
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:54,140
I'm kidding.

548
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:54,580
Just kidding.

549
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:56,460
I'm in Osaka, Japan for vacation.

550
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,340
Here's another awesome year.

551
00:26:58,540 --> 00:26:59,820
Thank you for the super chat Kyle.

552
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:00,060
Thank you.

553
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:02,640
Happy new year to the dragons on the other side of the world.

554
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:04,940
Or like on the other side of the region.

555
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:05,760
To be fair.

556
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:06,520
Alright guys.

557
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,160
Everyone watch.

558
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,960
Let's watch the compilation together.

559
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:10,300
I'm super.

560
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:11,260
I don't.

561
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:11,740
Like I said.

562
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:12,920
I don't know.

563
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:14,180
What's in it.

564
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:14,900
So we're all.

565
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:15,580
We're gonna be.

566
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,060
Reacting to it.

567
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:17,600
Together.

568
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:20,740
Of the year that we've been through.

569
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:21,600
Alright.

570
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:23,360
Yay.

571
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:23,840
Oh.

572
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:25,900
Let me shrink down a little bit.

573
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:26,300
Because.

574
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:29,160
Doki Amber Doge is a little cut off.

575
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:31,320
I think it's this one.

576
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:31,860
Wait.

577
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:32,020
No.

578
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:32,740
That's too small.

579
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:33,620
This one.

580
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:34,240
There you go.

581
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:35,100
Alright.

582
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:35,760
Alright.

583
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:36,320
You guys ready?

584
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:36,840
I don't know.

585
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:39,300
Let me know if the sound is okay.

586
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:40,360
Let me know.

587
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,060
For the video itself.

588
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:43,320
I think it's this video.

589
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:44,800
Kaka.

590
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:46,380
Kaka.

591
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:46,960
Kaka.

592
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:48,680
That's uncool.

593
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:50,400
Sorry.

594
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:52,940
The birth of croaky.

595
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,720
I can be like.

596
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:02,840
I'm sorry.

597
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:05,140
I think I have the most fun with this one.

598
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:06,500
The most.

599
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:07,280
My shit.

600
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:10,640
My shit post becoming real lore.

601
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:12,440
But.

602
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:13,160
But.

603
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:14,400
It feels weird.

604
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:16,860
That this seat is empty though.

605
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:17,580
Doki's like.

606
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:18,860
I'm so funny.

607
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:20,320
Oh.

608
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:21,180
Oh yeah.

609
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,220
There's the rest of Tubi.

610
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:22,940
Okay.

611
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:23,940
What the fuck?

612
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,280
What was that?

613
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:26,440
Hello?

614
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,000
That moment when it changed.

615
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:28,320
What was that?

616
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,360
It changed everything.

617
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:34,900
Kept you waiting, huh?

618
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:38,160
One of the most iconic moments.

619
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,840
It's already haunted by the champion.

620
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:41,760
Doki bird.

621
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:51,920
The moment the timeline diverged.

622
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:52,220
Yeah.

623
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:53,040
Yeah.

624
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:54,560
Okay.

625
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:55,640
Security.

626
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:58,500
My acting is really good, isn't it?

627
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:00,820
I thought I said.

628
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:01,480
No.

629
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:02,520
Crashes.

630
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:03,340
Tonight.

631
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,520
I mentioned this before.

632
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:06,560
But like.

633
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:07,940
This was literally planned.

634
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:09,200
I think like.

635
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:09,600
With.

636
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:10,120
Okay.

637
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:11,000
It's been months ago.

638
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:12,960
But within one to two days.

639
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:13,480
Like.

640
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:14,200
All of the.

641
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:14,500
The.

642
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:15,260
The fucking.

643
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:16,660
Crashing of Ressletuber.

644
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:18,700
Could actually be like.

645
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:18,940
At.

646
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:19,260
Like.

647
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:20,180
She's actually crashing.

648
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:20,920
Ressletuber.

649
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:22,120
Because it was like.

650
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,020
One to two days.

651
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:23,440
One to two days.

652
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:24,600
To set all of this up.

653
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:25,260
So.

654
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,540
I know I talked about it before.

655
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:28,400
If you guys didn't know.

656
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:29,440
If you guys didn't watch.

657
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:30,320
The behind the scenes.

658
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:31,120
Literally.

659
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:32,020
One to two days.

660
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:32,320
This.

661
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:33,380
One to two days ago.

662
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:34,340
This was all planned.

663
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:35,120
Uh.

664
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:35,520
What.

665
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:36,020
What.

666
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:36,220
What.

667
00:29:39,670 --> 00:29:40,750
How did it get here?

668
00:29:43,170 --> 00:29:43,770
How much.

669
00:29:43,890 --> 00:29:45,790
How much did we make on the auction?

670
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:46,390
Oh yeah.

671
00:29:47,170 --> 00:29:47,410
Alright.

672
00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:47,830
Where's the.

673
00:29:47,850 --> 00:29:48,350
The charity.

674
00:29:48,690 --> 00:29:48,890
Guys.

675
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:49,750
I know there are some goals.

676
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:50,650
That I haven't done yet.

677
00:29:50,910 --> 00:29:51,530
But like.

678
00:29:52,010 --> 00:29:52,890
Point twenty five.

679
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:54,190
Is where we accomplish.

680
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:55,490
All of the stuff.

681
00:29:55,670 --> 00:29:56,650
That hasn't been done yet.

682
00:29:56,770 --> 00:29:57,750
I was just.

683
00:29:57,930 --> 00:29:59,690
There was just too much stuff going on.

684
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:01,050
Every month.

685
00:30:01,530 --> 00:30:01,710
But.

686
00:30:01,870 --> 00:30:03,090
Twenty twenty five.

691
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:09,670
The paper was still not sent out.

692
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:10,850
Because the moment.

693
00:30:10,990 --> 00:30:12,550
I was about to send out the paper.

694
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:14,830
Canada post went on strike.

695
00:30:14,870 --> 00:30:15,410
For like.

696
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:16,510
Three plus months.

697

So.

698
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:22,030
So.

00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:23,730
If you're still.

00:30:23,870 --> 00:30:24,170
If you're watching.

701
00:30:24,170 --> 00:30:24,830
This.

702
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:25,950
Um.

00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:27,550
Yeah.

704
00:30:27,970 --> 00:30:29,930
Canada post went on strike.

705
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:32,230

00:30:33,130 --> 00:30:33,770

00:30:55,470 --> 00:30:56,270
It's finally.

728
00:30:56,550 --> 00:30:57,330
We can finally.

729
00:30:57,790 --> 00:30:58,430

Hadn't received postcards yet.

750
00:31:17,770 --> 00:31:18,450
Because like I said.

751
00:31:18,490 --> 00:31:19,890
The moment I was sending the postcards out.

752
00:31:20,810 --> 00:31:21,210

00:31:29,310 --> 00:31:30,490

00:32:04,670 --> 00:32:05,810
And they posted it on Twitter.

805
00:32:05,970 --> 00:32:07,330
Cause they were all being shipped out.

806
00:32:07,730 --> 00:32:08,890

807
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:10,070

I'm so happy.

823
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,700
That things are finally being.

824
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:30,400

Ha.

829
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:34,880
Minecraft is screwed in January.

830
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:35,680
Like I said.

831
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:36,080
Everything.

832
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:36,880
Is a lot.

833
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:38,260
There's a lot of stuff.

834
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:39,240
That's being fulfilled.

835
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:39,980
In January.

836
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:46,440
Oh my god.

837
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:46,820
The.

838
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:47,240
The fourth.

839
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,240
I really want to do another charity auction.

840
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:49,960
In the future.

841
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:51,580
And like invite other.

842
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:52,380
Uh.

843
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:53,280
Invite other.

844
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:53,980
Vtubers.

845
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:54,600
To join me.

846
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:55,640
Because I feel like.

847
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,100
It's such a great opportunity.

848
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:57,940
For charity.

849
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:58,460
And stuff.

850
00:32:58,720 --> 00:32:59,460
But I don't know.

851
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:00,980
I don't know if I will make a yearly thing.

852
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,580
I think it would be really cute though.

853
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:03,880
Like inviting artists.

854
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:05,200
To do it.

855
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:07,480
Obviously I don't think I'll raise as much as I did.

856
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:08,260
As last year.

857
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:10,680
Because I did have a lot of eyes on me last year.

858
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:11,760
Or this year.

859
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,340
But I would love to do it.

860
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:14,060
Um.

861
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:14,820
Oh my god.

862
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:15,980
I would love to do it again.

863
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:19,820
He changed to the keyboard.

864
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:19,940
Oh my god.

865
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:20,840
Oh yeah.

866
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,780
I remember pink dragons were like.

867
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,440
Fighting each other and stuff.

868
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:24,680
Oh.

869
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:25,340
Might be lower.

870
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,200
I'll lower it a little bit.

871
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:29,540
The natural voice swapped to the keyboard.

872
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:32,320
And the paper was just too expensive.

873
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:32,860
Oh shit.

874
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:33,620
My timer.

875
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:36,580
Let me move the timer a little bit.

876
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:40,640
Now I want the keyboard.

877
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:44,440
Oh that's so cute.

878
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:46,320
When you guys were like fighting for the.

879
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:49,420
When you guys were fighting for the um.

880
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:49,920
Keyboard.

881
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,010
For the auction items.

882
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:53,140
Like I'm me.

883
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,140
It's not a fursuit.

884
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:57,480
It's literally me.

885
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:58,200
It's me.

886
00:33:58,560 --> 00:33:59,160
It's literally me.

887
00:33:59,500 --> 00:33:59,980
It's not.

888
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:01,400
It's not a fursuit guys.

889
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,600
It's my skin suit.

890
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:05,520
That happens to be furry.

891
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:07,940
Oh I'm looking at you right now.

892
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:11,620
Do not.

893
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:12,340
Is that wrong?

894
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:13,140
Do not.

895
00:34:13,180 --> 00:34:15,200
I have no idea when I'll ever use this again.

896
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:16,580
I swear to god.

897
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:17,020
I know.

898
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:19,120
I have many forms.

899
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:19,900
And I'm like.

900
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:21,940
But instead of like.

901
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:23,140
Different outfits.

902
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:23,700
It's.

903
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:28,580
It's different shitposts.

904
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:32,500
I might have different amazing fashionista outfits.

905
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:34,900
I just have different shitposts.

906
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,800
Jesus Christ I feel so awkward here.

907
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:39,820
I feel like a third wheel right now.

908
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:42,320
Oh that's famous.

909
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:44,280
My infamous moment.

910
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:47,100
Oh.

911
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:49,880
We're doing playful flirting.

912
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,860
Are you and Peter still together?

913
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:52,940
Yeah.

914
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:55,740
Right next to me playing World of Warcraft.

915
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:57,820
Next to me playing World of Warcraft.

916
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:03,800
The face that made me viral within the normiesphere.

917
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:05,600
The Führer.

918
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:07,420
This shot could end the war.

919
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:09,440
This shot could end the war guys.

920
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,960
The shot that could end the war.

921
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:11,840
Are you what?

922
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:13,220
This shot could end the war.

923
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:14,680
God damn it.

924
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:15,160
The fuck?

925
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:17,220
It only took like ten shots.

926
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:17,680
How?

927
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:18,900
For me to end the war.

928
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:18,960
Nooo!

929
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:25,040
This shot you fuck!

930
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:32,060
It said could, not actual!

931
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:37,000
FPS vtuber of the year right there.

932
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:42,040
Let's go!

933
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,560
I did it.

934
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:44,760
I did it.

935
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:44,960
Yeah.

936
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:47,760
I did it guys.

937
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:50,280
The shot that could end the war.

938
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:55,620
I still can't believe they didn't show.

939
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:59,020
I wish they showed this clip at the VTuber Awards.

940
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:00,740
If there was a fire alarm, Tessa.

941
00:36:11,090 --> 00:36:12,990
If there was a fire alarm.

942
00:36:17,370 --> 00:36:18,210
And a blood flow.

943
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:22,550
Dad's like, please, please get me out of the house.

944
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:23,830
Get me out of the apartment.

945
00:36:24,770 --> 00:36:26,370
I don't want to die.

946
00:36:30,270 --> 00:36:31,630
Can't be the Big Mac.

947
00:36:32,270 --> 00:36:34,950
Oh no, the birth of the sloppy sisters.

948
00:36:35,210 --> 00:36:36,810
I wish that wasn't our name.

949
00:36:36,850 --> 00:36:39,110
We could be called anything else.

950
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:45,410
Oh, does it sound okay?

951
00:37:09,850 --> 00:37:12,370
We could be anything else.

952
00:37:12,370 --> 00:37:16,370
We could be anything else.

953
00:37:17,170 --> 00:37:20,350
Why did it have to be sloppy sisters?

954
00:37:22,350 --> 00:37:23,570
It's not.

955
00:37:23,690 --> 00:37:25,170
It's a Brad risk.

956
00:37:25,430 --> 00:37:26,630
That's why.

957
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:30,250
It's a fucking Brad risk.

958
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:33,970
What about now?

959
00:37:34,070 --> 00:37:34,770
Is it better now?

960
00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:40,290
I raised the volume a little bit.

961
00:37:45,390 --> 00:37:46,990
I'm the Rizzler.

962
00:37:49,450 --> 00:37:49,970
Alright.

963
00:37:55,390 --> 00:37:58,590
I know some of you guys are like, Doki, you need to stop.

964
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:06,590
Sorry, I know this is my clip, but like, I forgot about it.

965
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:13,120
Sorry, that stunned me a second time.

966
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:28,860
I can handle plenty.

967
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:31,860
Oh my god.

968
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:35,420
Oh my god, okay.

969
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:36,360
Okay.

970
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:45,340
Guys, you wouldn't have reacted the same way.

971
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:50,380
What do you say to that?

972
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:53,220
You wouldn't have reacted the same way.

973
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:03,140
Honestly, hun, not exactly what I was...

974
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:05,800
I'm not scared of what...

975
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:09,260
We had an incredibly long day, guys.

976
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:11,660
So it's time.

977
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:14,420
It's time to head off and travel.

978
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:16,120
Oh my god.

979
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,400
What if it's someone else?

980
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:19,680
This was Medi's fault, right?

981
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:20,940
Medi clipped this, right?

982
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:30,280
Okay.

983
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:32,420
What was I gonna say before?

984
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:34,940
Before I got, like, stunlocked?

985
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:39,160
Before I got, like, stunlocked on the...

986
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:41,500
Oh yeah, I know a lot of you guys...

987
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:43,260
Some of you guys complain and be like...

988
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:49,220
Doki, you need to, like, read about what the context is of the games before you start...

989
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:50,140
Before you play.

990
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:52,020
Like, how could you not, like...

991
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:53,640
Like, research a little...

992
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:58,060
Look, if I researched a little bit of, like, what the game is that I'm playing...

993
00:39:58,060 --> 00:40:01,320
We would not have got, like, amazing reactions from me.

994
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:01,960
Like, I...

995
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:06,740
If I knew what was going on...

996
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:07,360
There you go.

997
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:10,440
Like, it wouldn't be a good stream.

998
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:12,740
Like, that's the thing.

999
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:17,340
Like, I'm going in with zero context and just be like...

1000
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:19,440
Alright, let's see what this game is about.

1001
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:21,120
And then, like, fucking elaborate.

1002
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:22,440
Like, I'll be like...

1003
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:25,060
Oh yeah, I've read about this, like, on Google.

1004
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:27,620
Like, about how this game is about.

1005
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:28,800
That's why, like, apparently...

1006
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:31,480
Um...

1007
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:33,960
A lot of people really liked my...

1008
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:34,420
What was it called?

1009
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:35,840
Me side stream.

1010
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:38,440
Because I was, like, one of the few people...

1011
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:40,800
That had no fucking idea what was...

1012
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:41,800
What was...

1013
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:45,300
What I was in for going in.

1014
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:48,220
Because literally, all I saw about it was that...

1015
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:50,080
Wow, it has 30,000 reviews.

1016
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:52,640
And it's about this girl that I could fix.

1017
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:53,660
Wow, that's a lot.

1018
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:56,380
This has to be the new FOMO.

1019
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:58,600
The new FOMO of the year, right?

1020
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:00,300
The new FOMO game of the month.

1021
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:02,680
And...

1022
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:05,080
Little did I know...

1023
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:06,760
It was a fucking horror game.

1024
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:10,960
Oh, is this horse?

1025
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:11,640
It's fine.

1026
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:13,680
It's fine.

1027
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:16,900
No.

1028
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:19,540
There's no...

1029
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:23,820
There's no...

1030
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:25,780
I can't believe...

1031
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:27,240
Did I lose my horse there?

1032
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:30,180
Oh my god, I lost my horse there.

1033
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:33,220
I thought this was the one...

1034
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:34,360
Where I walked through the mine.

1035
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:36,900
I forgot I also got a horse.

1036
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:44,240
Today's a bad day.

1037
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:48,780
Now I've woken up from my coma.

1038
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:52,820
He already fucked it up.

1039
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:53,700
How did he...

1040
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:55,120
This one!

1041
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:57,240
King Ark!

1042
00:41:57,940 --> 00:41:58,960
Oh my god.

1043
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:02,540
This is when I defeated...

1044
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:03,080
Yay!

1045
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:05,540
This is my... Yay!

1046
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:08,460
Yay!

1047
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:14,060
Oh my god, I think he actually learned though.

1048
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:16,840
Come to me, Gerard.

1049
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:17,440
Oh yeah.

1050
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:22,020
Heal your armor.

1051
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:23,180
That's crazy.

1052
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:28,200
I got people who recognize me from like fighting games in Marvel Rivals.

1053
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:31,700
They're like, Oh, I saw you at the Tree Fighters stage at M-Slam.

1054
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:32,500
You did great.

1055
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:33,380
And I was like, what?

1056
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:39,020
This one that literally just happened last week.

1057
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:42,120
You're gonna stand outside and die.

1058
00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:43,940
And then I'm going to respawn you.

1059
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:46,280
And then we get evil points for doing that.

1060
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:47,220
Just shoot at them if you can.

1061
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:49,080
Where are they?

1062
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:53,160
So when you get res'd, Gerard, we might get pushed.

1063
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:56,260
And if we get pushed, I need you to take your armor right away.

1064
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:58,480
Good soldiers follow orders.

1065
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:00,600
Die and take the armor here.

1066
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:05,040
You can walk out and start trying to die here.

1067
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:11,660
You can walk out and start trying to die here.

1068
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:13,180
Come back!

1069
00:43:13,180 --> 00:43:13,880
Come back!

1070
00:43:16,620 --> 00:43:20,180
You can walk out and start trying to die here.

1071
00:43:23,820 --> 00:43:27,660
Well, I'm dead.

1072
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:37,680
There's her POV.

1073
00:43:43,180 --> 00:43:43,620
There's her POV.

1074
00:43:48,910 --> 00:43:51,760
They're like, what is she doing?

1075
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:57,940
What is she doing?

1076
00:43:57,940 --> 00:44:00,280
No, you don't have to go there!

1077
00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:06,220
Okay,

1078
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:10,600
just stay here.

1079
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:12,000
No, you don't have to go there!

1080
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:14,380
No, you don't have to go there!

1081
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:16,020
No, you don't have to go there!

1082
00:44:18,290 --> 00:44:20,330
Stay here!

1083
00:44:20,370 --> 00:44:21,030
Stay here!

1084
00:44:25,470 --> 00:44:28,690
Guys, I am the queen.

1085
00:44:29,030 --> 00:44:30,450
I'm the queen of the server.

1086
00:44:30,690 --> 00:44:31,910
I'm in power forever.

1087
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:35,090
My Minecraft server will be set up January.

1088
00:44:36,430 --> 00:44:40,110
We will have everything finished in January.

1089
00:44:41,110 --> 00:44:41,910
Doki Land.

1090
00:44:42,070 --> 00:44:44,810
And thus a town shall form around me.

1091
00:44:44,950 --> 00:44:47,070
Everything the light touches is mine.

1092
00:44:47,970 --> 00:44:51,510
Guys, if you build around Doki Land, you gotta pay taxes.

1093
00:44:51,930 --> 00:44:54,570
I will reopen Doki Land.

1094
00:44:54,950 --> 00:44:56,430
I am the queen.

1095
00:44:56,630 --> 00:44:58,730
You think queens live off bread?

1096
00:44:59,350 --> 00:45:03,130
Doki Land will be returned in January.

1097
00:45:03,990 --> 00:45:04,730
I swear to God.

1098
00:45:05,150 --> 00:45:06,050
You deserve a bread.

1099
00:45:06,530 --> 00:45:08,770
I'm here to feed you guys!

1100
00:45:08,890 --> 00:45:09,150
Hello!

1101
00:45:10,210 --> 00:45:11,490
Do not worry, dragon!

1102
00:45:12,330 --> 00:45:13,410
Have some bread!

1103
00:45:13,950 --> 00:45:15,510
I own Doki Land!

1104
00:45:15,970 --> 00:45:20,050
I'm literally paying for the server and everything.

1105
00:45:20,850 --> 00:45:23,830
I'm like, I'm going through stuff right now.

1106
00:45:33,950 --> 00:45:35,850
Thank you so much.

1107
00:45:36,930 --> 00:45:38,770
That's a real homie.

1108
00:45:38,950 --> 00:45:40,330
Oh my God, I'm a hell of a diver.

1109
00:45:44,670 --> 00:45:46,510
You are special.

1110
00:45:46,670 --> 00:45:47,330
Spawn me in.

1111
00:45:49,490 --> 00:45:50,690
Look at all the loot!

1112
00:45:57,370 --> 00:45:58,950
Oh my God, free loot!

1113
00:45:59,350 --> 00:46:00,170
Free loot!

1114
00:46:00,170 --> 00:46:00,650
Wow!

1115
00:46:12,470 --> 00:46:18,630
I know what to do.

1116
00:46:18,750 --> 00:46:23,270
I'm gonna say hi to them and then wait for them to come close to me and they'll think I'm a good person.

1117
00:46:23,650 --> 00:46:24,970
Oh no, not the rain.

1118
00:46:25,430 --> 00:46:27,110
I can't find any cover.

1119
00:46:27,110 --> 00:46:28,870
I can't hold it.

1120
00:46:28,870 --> 00:46:30,190
The perfect plan.

1121
00:46:30,670 --> 00:46:31,410
Say hi back.

1122
00:46:31,850 --> 00:46:34,410
We gotta find cover.

1123
00:46:34,470 --> 00:46:35,090
Look at me.

1124
00:46:35,550 --> 00:46:37,710
I'm such a good friend.

1125
00:46:38,310 --> 00:46:40,010
That was such a good edit.

1126
00:46:40,390 --> 00:46:41,110
Friend?

1127
00:46:50,940 --> 00:46:52,940
Come on now.

1128
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:55,300
The betrayal.

1129
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:02,120
Whoever created this world has like lore.

1130
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:04,140
Wait, there's a nuclear bomb, guys.

1131
00:47:04,180 --> 00:47:04,840
I found it.

1132
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:10,820
Okay, let me give you a context of that.

1133
00:47:14,220 --> 00:47:21,000
So like, when you have the nuclear bomb there's usually...

1134
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,700
Look, this is our first time.

1135
00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:23,740
Okay, I'll rewatch.

1136
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:24,960
I actually really love that clip.

1137
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:26,060
That clip was so great.

1138
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:28,380
I need it.

1139
00:47:32,380 --> 00:47:33,840
That clip was so good.

1140
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:36,220
The nuclear bomb.

1141
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:37,360
I didn't even stream it.

1142
00:47:37,420 --> 00:47:39,160
I wish I streamed it, but I was so tired.

1143
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:41,680
Whoever created this world has like lore.

1144
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:44,480
Wait, there's a nuclear bomb, guys.

1145
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:45,180
I found it.

1146
00:47:48,460 --> 00:47:52,780
I wish I did stream it so you guys could know what the fuck happened.

1147
00:47:52,780 --> 00:47:57,900
But like, the reason why I didn't stream was I had like three other things going on on that day.

1148
00:47:58,340 --> 00:48:11,760
I had like the Apex tournament, the back-to-back Apex tournament, and also I had the convention appearances and stuff, so I was super tired, so I couldn't stream it because I was like, I couldn't do more.

1149
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:13,440
So...

1150
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:20,700
Context-wise, when you get the nuclear bomb out, it has a timer.

1151
00:48:20,700 --> 00:48:22,840
It's supposed to have a timer.

1152
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:28,080
It's supposed to go like, beep, beep, beep, kaboom.

1153
00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:43,100
But, when I found I was the first one to find a nuclear bomb in the inventory, but when I took the bomb out and placed it, it went...

1154
00:48:43,100 --> 00:48:59,660
I was with Limu, and Limu activated a firework at the same time when I placed the nuclear bomb, so it activated it instantly.

1155
00:49:02,540 --> 00:49:06,120
That's basically what happened.

1156
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:12,600
So the moment I placed the bomb, it got activated instantly.

1157
00:49:20,260 --> 00:49:27,480
Because Limu's firework also went off at the same time.

1158
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:34,940
So that's why that's why there was no hesitation on the fucking explosion.

1159
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:40,480
It literally just went off the moment I said that.

1160
00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:45,960
Oh my god.

1161
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:47,140
Wait, I'll show you something.

1162
00:49:47,260 --> 00:49:47,720
Jerry, come here.

1163
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:50,440
You don't trust me?

1164
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:54,680
Why would you trust me?

1165
00:49:55,860 --> 00:49:56,060
What?

1166
00:49:57,460 --> 00:49:59,140
Why don't you trust me?

1167
00:49:59,730 --> 00:50:01,620
I'm literally...

1168
00:50:01,620 --> 00:50:04,200
Okay, I can spell employee backwards.

1169
00:50:04,620 --> 00:50:10,160
E-E-Y-O-L-P-M-E I literally can spell employee backwards.

1170
00:50:12,940 --> 00:50:16,420
E-E-Y-O-L-P What do you mean?

1171
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:17,220
Look at your top right.

1172
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:18,480
What does your top right say?

1173
00:50:19,460 --> 00:50:20,860
You fucking idiot.

1174
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:27,620
Classic Trouble in Terrorist Town.

1175
00:50:28,020 --> 00:50:30,340
I played a lot of TTT back then.

1176
00:50:30,980 --> 00:50:33,280
If you're in a suspense, then backwards.

1177
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:35,680
Oh hey, I'm employee.

1178
00:50:36,220 --> 00:50:41,980
E-E-Y E-E-Y-O-L-M E Employee

1179
00:50:45,420 --> 00:50:45,860
What?

1180
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:47,880
I'm employee.

1181
00:50:48,740 --> 00:50:50,560
I spelled it correctly.

1182
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:53,880
My brain lagged a little bit.

1183
00:50:53,900 --> 00:50:59,940
E -E -Y-O-L-M E-E-Y-O-L-M E-E-Y-O-L-M I can't.

1184
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:01,440
I spelled it wrong twice.

1185
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:04,140
She misspelled employee.

1186
00:51:05,140 --> 00:51:06,600
I swear to god she misspelled employee.

1187
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:08,660
I swear to god she misspelled employee.

1188
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:12,200
I'm so fucking one time.

1189
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:18,340
I forgot the P. I forgot P twice in a row.

1190
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,640
It was true.

1191
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:37,820
Somebody started a fire.

1192
00:51:38,340 --> 00:51:41,360
Somebody started a fire in this HR.

1193
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:47,060
I was calling HR.

1194
00:51:48,140 --> 00:51:49,660
And then a fire showed up.

1195
00:51:51,660 --> 00:51:53,100
That game?

1196
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:58,060
That office game literally lasted one week.

1197
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:00,560
That's so impressive for a streamer game.

1198
00:52:05,060 --> 00:52:06,880
That's so impressive.

1199
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:10,920
It literally died within a week.

1200
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:14,700
I actually did nothing.

1201
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:16,700
You know why it died within a week?

1202
00:52:17,020 --> 00:52:23,240
Because this game, if you play it like two or three times, it's so boring.

1203
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:29,420
After that, like, you have to get like a lobby where people are willing to roleplay.

1204
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:33,560
Because if people try hard in this lobby, it's not fun.

1205
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:37,200
Like the whole thing about this game being fun is if they roleplay.

1206
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:44,880
But if you don't roleplay and if you just actually look for slackers and just do your job, it's not even fun.

1207
00:52:45,100 --> 00:52:47,700
A lot of times, people don't roleplay.

1208
00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:51,680
I didn't even start the fire!

1209
00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:53,820
I'm blazing!

1210
00:52:54,580 --> 00:52:57,640
I'm gonna put everybody's thing in jello.

1211
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:00,360
I'm gonna start every fire.

1212
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:04,380
I'm gonna put everybody's thing in jello now.

1213
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:06,300
No connection.

1214
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:09,000
And with bandit?

1215
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:09,680
What the fuck?

1216
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:13,820
That's fucking right.

1217
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:15,020
This is your fault.

1218
00:53:15,020 --> 00:53:17,300
I did nothing wrong!

1219
00:53:21,980 --> 00:53:23,760
I can't even start the fire!

1220
00:53:24,660 --> 00:53:25,920
This is it.

1221
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,360
This janitor's going fucking rogue.

1222
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:32,760
Just put everything in jello.

1223
00:53:33,620 --> 00:53:35,400
Nobody's out of nowhere.

1224
00:53:35,620 --> 00:53:36,180
Stop me!

1225
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:38,340
That's right!

1226
00:53:38,780 --> 00:53:39,180
Jello!

1227
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:43,140
Everybody's thing is gonna be in jello!

1228
00:53:43,140 --> 00:53:45,260
I fucking hate my job.

1229
00:53:45,460 --> 00:53:46,240
I hate my job.

1230
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:46,840
I get paid.

1231
00:53:47,020 --> 00:53:49,100
I was a fucking supervisor.

1232
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:50,720
I had the perfect office.

1233
00:53:51,020 --> 00:53:52,040
I had everything.

1234
00:53:52,820 --> 00:53:56,180
I don't work here anymore, so I don't even have cigarettes!

1235
00:53:57,720 --> 00:54:00,280
I'm gonna steal this person's cigarette.

1236
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:01,780
I'm gonna steal.

1237
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:06,160
I'm gonna make sure nobody's gonna have a good time.

1238
00:54:06,900 --> 00:54:08,540
Fuck this job.

1239
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:10,580
All I do is work.

1240
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:12,780
It doesn't matter how hard I work.

1241
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:13,680
It doesn't matter.

1242
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:14,800
You just get fired.

1243
00:54:14,900 --> 00:54:17,060
You go in, you clock in, you clock out.

1244
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:19,760
And then no matter how hard you work, you still get fired.

1245
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,020
I'm just roleplaying, guys.

1246
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:23,120
I'm not.

1247
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:26,180
Guys, I swear to God, I was just...

1248
00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:28,660
I was just roleplaying.

1249
00:54:28,980 --> 00:54:30,400
Guys, I swear to God.

1250
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:32,280
Too real.

1251
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:36,780
The roleplay is getting a little too real.

1252
00:54:39,860 --> 00:54:42,680
That's cause I was working my office job.

1253
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:43,880
What do you mean?

1254
00:54:45,180 --> 00:54:46,140
That's just...

1255
00:54:46,140 --> 00:54:49,100
I was roleplaying as an office worker.

1256
00:54:51,540 --> 00:54:52,700
Oh my God.

1257
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:54,500
That was a nice recap.

1258
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:56,320
That was a nice best of...

1259
00:54:56,320 --> 00:54:58,020
Not best of, like a year in review.

1260
00:54:58,620 --> 00:55:02,900
I think, like, obviously we have added more clips and everything, but there was a lot.

1261
00:55:03,220 --> 00:55:04,700
I think, like, we did that.

1262
00:55:04,700 --> 00:55:07,700
It was done within, like, a couple of hours looking through.

1263
00:55:08,220 --> 00:55:11,640
But it was a very fun compilation looking back.

1264
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:14,760
Yeah, what a year.

1265
00:55:15,100 --> 00:55:22,900
I was asking one of my mods to compile, like, conventions that I've done throughout the year, like my Doki World Tour.

1266
00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:24,780
And oh my God.

1267
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:26,940
Like, let me read this off to you guys.

1268
00:55:27,740 --> 00:55:31,600
I was in Dokamine... I was in Germany for Dokamine.

1269
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:36,400
I was in Anime North in Canada, Toronto.

1270
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:39,560
AVCon in Australia, Adelaide.

1271
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:44,700
Anime Expo with iBUYPOWER in Hyatt in US Los Angeles.

1272
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:48,160

I'm pretty sure I'm missing a lot of other conventions.

1284
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:33,340
Because, like, my mod, my staff member, was like, I don't even know.

My staff member that asked if this was the whole list, they were like, I don't even know if this is the whole list.

00:58:10,540 --> 00:58:11,580
Also, use Fortnite.

1312
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:17,220
Sorry, there's a Fortnite creator code, but that's not what I'm trying to do right now.

1313
00:58:17,620 --> 00:58:18,960
Alright, what happened to us?

1323
00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:42,540

1324
00:58:42,540 --> 00:58:44,600
I need to disappear for a sec.

1325
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:45,360
Give me a sec.

1326

Oh wait, no.

1330
00:58:57,400 --> 00:58:59,080
I need to turn this on.

1331
00:59:00,940 --> 00:59:01,420

1332
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:02,980

There we go.

1338
00:59:18,700 --> 00:59:19,440
I think that's it.

1339
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:20,480
That should be...

1340
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:22,180
since I'm typing, I gotta fix stuff.

1341
00:59:22,620 --> 00:59:24,180
Sorry, New Year's scuff.

1342
00:59:24,300 --> 00:59:27,900

keycaps.

1346
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:40,260
I wanna make this smaller too.

1347
00:59:40,260 --> 00:59:41,100
Wow!

1348
00:59:43,900 --> 00:59:44,500

1349
00:59:45,120 --> 00:59:46,780
I don't even know if I could fit everything.

1350
00:59:47,020 --> 00:59:49,420
There's so many things that happened.

1351
00:59:50,260 --> 00:59:56,560
So we had the Nendoroid, the custom PC case, 3D...

1352
00:59:56,560 --> 00:59:56,700

1354
01:00:07,070 --> 01:00:09,070
Let me disappear for a sec again.

Oh my God, I'm messing things up, everybody.

1359
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:27,980
I'm messing stuff up.

1360

1456
01:05:33,430 --> 01:05:35,600

01:05:36,060 --> 01:05:36,780
That's true.

1458
01:05:37,120 --> 01:05:39,780

1459
01:05:39,780 --> 01:05:40,680
Uh...

1460
01:05:40,680 --> 01:05:43,620
From different backgrounds.

1461
01:05:45,160 --> 01:05:46,180

This list goes on and on and on.

1465
01:05:58,200 --> 01:05:59,220
Um...

1466
01:05:59,220 --> 01:06:01,220
Is there any other accomplishments that we have?

1467
01:06:02,180 --> 01:06:04,220
I don't even know.

1468
01:06:04,760 --> 01:06:06,500
There's so many accomplishments.

1469
01:06:06,500 --> 01:06:08,920
Oh, MSI!

1470
01:06:09,360 --> 01:06:10,220
Sponsor.

1471
01:06:10,820 --> 01:06:12,260
Sponsored by MSI.

1472
01:06:15,210 --> 01:06:17,030
What else do we have?

1473
01:06:19,110 --> 01:06:19,530
Croaky.

1474
01:06:20,030 --> 01:06:22,290
Croaky is definitely an accomplishment.

1475
01:06:22,470 --> 01:06:23,110
Not gonna lie.

1476
01:06:26,910 --> 01:06:28,750
I think...

1477
01:06:28,750 --> 01:06:30,370
Croaky is like...

1478
01:06:30,370 --> 01:06:33,510
Croaky is definitely an accomplishment on its own.

1479
01:06:38,610 --> 01:06:39,930
Oh my god.

1480
01:06:41,910 --> 01:06:43,070
Oh my god.

1481
01:06:43,270 --> 01:06:45,290
Is there anything else I've done this year?

1482
01:06:46,810 --> 01:06:47,770
There's a lot though.

1483
01:06:48,050 --> 01:06:49,770
But is there anything else I missed out?

1484
01:06:53,660 --> 01:06:54,940
Bought real...

1485
01:06:54,940 --> 01:06:55,460
Guys!

1486
01:06:55,600 --> 01:06:57,080
That's not accomplishment!

1487
01:06:59,140 --> 01:07:00,360
That's not...

1488
01:07:00,360 --> 01:07:02,660
Buying plates is not...

1489
01:07:02,660 --> 01:07:03,580
Guys, please.

1490
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:07,940
I don't wanna call it an accomplishment.

1491
01:07:08,180 --> 01:07:09,780
That's just too sad.

1492
01:07:10,280 --> 01:07:15,800
That's way too sad if you say that's an accomplishment, guys.

1493
01:07:19,460 --> 01:07:23,760
And it's not that important, everyone.

1494
01:07:24,140 --> 01:07:26,480
It's not that important.

1495
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:28,100
I swear to god.

1496
01:07:28,720 --> 01:07:31,000
It's not.

1497
01:07:31,500 --> 01:07:34,300
It's not that important, guys.

1498
01:07:34,780 --> 01:07:36,800
It's not a milestone.

1499
01:07:38,120 --> 01:07:42,300
It's just basic necessities, chat.

1500
01:07:45,840 --> 01:07:48,200
For you, it was an accomplishment.

1501
01:07:48,560 --> 01:07:50,760
Lord Kuro says thank you for the super chat.

1502
01:07:50,840 --> 01:07:52,040
Thank you, thank you.

1503
01:07:52,680 --> 01:07:53,540
What else?

1504
01:07:53,620 --> 01:07:54,420
What else did we...

1505
01:07:54,900 --> 01:07:57,820
What else have we done so far?

1506
01:07:59,020 --> 01:07:59,580
Um...

1507
01:07:59,580 --> 01:08:02,300
I feel like there has to be a lot more stuff.

1508
01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:06,680
I feel like I've done so many things that I can't like...

1509
01:08:07,340 --> 01:08:10,460
I'm like trying... I feel like I've done so many things that I...

1510
01:08:10,460 --> 01:08:11,840
There must be more things.

1511
01:08:12,200 --> 01:08:16,040
I is moving.

1512
01:08:16,320 --> 01:08:16,540
Yeah.

1513
01:08:16,680 --> 01:08:20,440
Like, I moved too, but that's like a personal accomplishment.

1514
01:08:21,340 --> 01:08:22,960
Uh... the YouTube recap.

1515
01:08:23,160 --> 01:08:24,400
Oh my god, you're right!

1516
01:08:24,520 --> 01:08:26,120

1517
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:30,640
Part of the official YouTube recap.

1518
01:08:31,700 --> 01:08:34,320
That's crazy that that was a thing too.

1519
01:08:35,100 --> 01:08:37,280
Uh... Oh, silver play button.

1520
01:08:37,540 --> 01:08:37,860

01:08:50,580 --> 01:08:51,540
You're right.

1526
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:52,740
No, that's my accomplishment.

I did that.

1543
01:09:49,160 --> 01:09:49,780
I almost forgot.

1544
01:09:50,120 --> 01:09:50,840
I did that.

1545
01:09:50,940 --> 01:09:52,660

01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:21,860
There's so much stuff that like there's things that I forgot happened.

1557
01:10:24,100 --> 01:10:25,320
Okay, we did that.

1558
01:10:25,320 --> 01:10:26,780
What else?

1559
01:10:28,400 --> 01:10:29,040
Uh...

1560
01:10:30,890 --> 01:10:33,030

1561
01:10:33,210 --> 01:10:33,770

1565
01:10:38,730 --> 01:10:39,350
You're right.

Twitch partner.

1567
01:10:40,610 --> 01:10:42,130
I got Twitch partner this year.

1568
01:10:42,270 --> 01:10:45,030
I forgot I got Twitch partner this year.

1569
01:10:46,210 --> 01:10:47,870
It's so long ago.

1570
01:10:48,330 --> 01:10:51,150
I legitimately forgot I got Twitch partner this year.

1571
01:10:55,090 --> 01:10:56,570
What else happened?

1572
01:10:59,570 --> 01:11:00,550
Happy New Year, Doki.

1573
01:11:00,690 --> 01:11:02,190
Hope you dropkick 2025.

1574
01:11:02,490 --> 01:11:03,530
Thank you for the super chat win.

1575
01:11:03,590 --> 01:11:04,830
Thank you, thank you.

1576
01:11:11,670 --> 01:11:14,610
May the shot that ended the war...

1577
01:11:16,910 --> 01:11:19,350
Let me know when there's 10 minutes left, guys.

1578
01:11:19,550 --> 01:11:20,370
Let me know.

1579
01:11:20,830 --> 01:11:21,730
I gotta be sure.

1580
01:11:21,730 --> 01:11:23,930
I gotta make sure that we...

1581
01:11:24,890 --> 01:11:28,590
I gotta be sure that we make it in time.

1582
01:11:29,350 --> 01:11:32,910
It'll be very awkward if we didn't make it in time, chat.

1583
01:11:33,110 --> 01:11:35,650
It'll be very awkward.

1584
01:11:38,670 --> 01:11:40,390
Burrito, thank you for the magenta super.

1585
01:11:40,570 --> 01:11:41,490
Thank you, thank you.

1586
01:11:41,810 --> 01:11:44,310
I hope you're proud of yourself as much as we are, Doki.

1587
01:11:44,430 --> 01:11:45,370
Thank you for the magenta super.

1588
01:11:45,530 --> 01:11:45,730
Thank you.

1589
01:11:46,350 --> 01:11:50,670
Honestly, like, we've done so much within 2024.

1590
01:11:51,550 --> 01:11:53,710
Like, this is crazy.

1591
01:11:55,330 --> 01:11:59,190
The fact that we accomplished so much.

1592
01:11:59,690 --> 01:12:00,170
You know what?

1593
01:12:00,250 --> 01:12:01,490
No, this is one of them too.

1594
01:12:02,010 --> 01:12:04,490
I want to collab with Doopie.

1595
01:12:09,230 --> 01:12:11,090
Collab with Doopie.

1596
01:12:12,610 --> 01:12:14,610
I love Doopie.

1597
01:12:16,250 --> 01:12:17,050
For real.

1598
01:12:21,590 --> 01:12:23,130
I want to play Marble Rivals with Doopie.

1599
01:12:23,370 --> 01:12:26,910
She asked if I want... She asked if, like, I'm down to play, and I was like, yeah!

1600
01:12:27,310 --> 01:12:33,250
And I was too far gone into my own addiction that I forgot to ask her to...

1601
01:12:35,110 --> 01:12:40,350
She asked me to play Marble Rivals like, sometime, and I was like, fuck yeah, let's do it.

1602
01:12:40,590 --> 01:12:46,350
But then I got so fucking addicted in my own rank that, like, I was too far gone.

1603
01:12:47,810 --> 01:12:49,170
Too far gone.

1604
01:12:53,270 --> 01:12:53,710
Um...

1605
01:12:53,710 --> 01:12:56,090
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1606
01:12:56,090 --> 01:12:56,970
Happy New Year, Doki.

1607
01:12:57,090 --> 01:13:00,590
I just want to say that you helped me both get through and recover from my chemo throughout the year.

1608
01:13:00,930 --> 01:13:03,970
So, thank you so much for making us all smile and laugh.

1609
01:13:04,450 --> 01:13:05,850
Also, New Year's, it was my birthday.

1610
01:13:06,010 --> 01:13:07,990
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1611
01:13:08,110 --> 01:13:09,730
Happy birthday to you.

1612
01:13:10,030 --> 01:13:11,410
Happy birthday to you.

1613
01:13:11,630 --> 01:13:13,470
Happy birthday, dear Waverius.

1614
01:13:13,810 --> 01:13:15,210
Happy birthday to you.

1615
01:13:15,650 --> 01:13:16,090
Yay!

1616
01:13:19,010 --> 01:13:20,350
Happy New Year!

1617
01:13:20,350 --> 01:13:22,050
I really appreciate it.

1618
01:13:22,130 --> 01:13:22,870
Thank you.

1619
01:13:23,930 --> 01:13:25,290
So many stuff.

1620
01:13:26,010 --> 01:13:32,310
Alright, I think, like, there's I feel like there's more, because, like, like I said, so many things happened.

1621
01:13:32,570 --> 01:13:36,370
But, yeah, I feel like there was more stuff that happened.

1622
01:13:37,390 --> 01:13:37,910
So...

1623
01:13:39,230 --> 01:13:39,750
So...

1624
01:13:39,750 --> 01:13:45,470
Um, so, like, this is okay for now.

1625
01:13:45,550 --> 01:13:47,950
This is a list of what we could remember together.

1626
01:13:47,950 --> 01:13:48,810
Uh...

1627
01:13:51,190 --> 01:13:57,150
Like, within, like, less than a... within less than a year, we did all of this.

1628
01:13:57,230 --> 01:14:00,430
Yeah, this is looking very fucking huge.

1629
01:14:00,490 --> 01:14:06,690
But within less than a year, that is, like, a lot of shit that happened on just, like, my own life in general.

1630
01:14:07,770 --> 01:14:08,290
Um...

1631
01:14:08,290 --> 01:14:08,690
Alright.

1632
01:14:09,210 --> 01:14:10,010
Let's see.

1633
01:14:11,410 --> 01:14:12,190
Let's see.

1634
01:14:12,310 --> 01:14:13,950
Let me, uh...

1635
01:14:13,950 --> 01:14:14,930
Uh...

1636
01:14:15,700 --> 01:14:18,170
Let me, uh...

1637
01:14:18,170 --> 01:14:18,970
Put... Alright.

1638
01:14:19,490 --> 01:14:22,610
I wanna put... Okay, let me resize this real fast.

1639
01:14:23,030 --> 01:14:24,030
I'll resize this.

1640
01:14:24,470 --> 01:14:24,850
Boop.

1641
01:14:26,490 --> 01:14:27,350
Boop.

1642
01:14:27,830 --> 01:14:29,470
And then...

1643
01:14:29,470 --> 01:14:30,570
Put this here.

1644
01:14:31,670 --> 01:14:32,150
Boop.

1645
01:14:32,730 --> 01:14:33,290
Alright.

1646
01:14:36,360 --> 01:14:37,480
There you go.

1647
01:14:37,520 --> 01:14:39,520
So these are things that happened...

1648
01:14:39,520 --> 01:14:42,560
These are things that happened this year.

1649
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:44,120
Within a year.

1650
01:14:44,120 --> 01:14:45,420
Write an orchestra?

1651
01:14:45,800 --> 01:14:47,560
Okay, but I didn't do that.

1652
01:14:47,660 --> 01:14:48,660
A dragoon did it.

1653
01:14:50,860 --> 01:14:53,040
That wasn't my accomplishment.

1654
01:14:53,700 --> 01:14:56,040
That wasn't... Wait, no.

1655
01:14:56,200 --> 01:14:56,420
Okay.

1656
01:14:57,040 --> 01:14:58,300
I mean, I paid...

1657
01:14:58,300 --> 01:14:59,440
I paid for it.

1658
01:14:59,980 --> 01:15:01,620
I don't know.

1659
01:15:02,080 --> 01:15:06,140
I don't see that as, like, an accomplishment because I paid for it.

1660
01:15:06,140 --> 01:15:06,900
Like...

1661
01:15:12,780 --> 01:15:14,900
So, like, it's not really an accomplishment.

1662
01:15:15,120 --> 01:15:16,500
It's something I did.

1663
01:15:18,780 --> 01:15:21,700
Without realizing how expensive it was.

1664
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:24,620
I was just literally like, oh yeah, you wanna do a real orchestra?

1665
01:15:24,820 --> 01:15:25,840
I was like, that's pretty cool.

1666
01:15:26,080 --> 01:15:27,420
How expensive could it be?

1667
01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:30,160
Little did I know, it was pretty expensive.

1668
01:15:30,480 --> 01:15:33,840
So, like, I learned how expensive orchestras are.

1669
01:15:38,540 --> 01:15:38,980
Um...

1670
01:15:38,980 --> 01:15:40,240
Okay, alright.

1671
01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:42,400
2025 goals.

1672
01:15:43,220 --> 01:15:44,620
I mean, I did do a New Year's...

1673
01:15:44,620 --> 01:15:46,060
Okay, New Year's resolution.

1674
01:15:46,700 --> 01:15:48,620
Or, I don't even think it's gonna be a New Year's resolution.

1675
01:15:48,840 --> 01:15:52,020
It's more so of, like, things that are definitely happening.

1676
01:15:52,660 --> 01:15:53,040
I think.

1677
01:15:53,080 --> 01:15:54,200
I think that's a better word.

1678
01:15:55,320 --> 01:15:55,760
2025.

1679
01:15:57,040 --> 01:15:59,440
2025 plans.

1680
01:16:01,220 --> 01:16:02,100
Original song?

1681
01:16:03,020 --> 01:16:03,460
That's...

1682
01:16:03,460 --> 01:16:04,680
Still being worked on?

1683
01:16:05,560 --> 01:16:06,380
Cover songs?

1684
01:16:06,680 --> 01:16:08,280
That are still being worked on?

1685
01:16:09,680 --> 01:16:10,320
That's...

1686
01:16:10,320 --> 01:16:19,460
I was supposed to release two covers this year, but, like, obviously, there were some delays, so, like...

1687
01:16:19,460 --> 01:16:19,780
Uh...

1688
01:16:21,340 --> 01:16:24,400
So, like, we weren't able to release them in time.

1689
01:16:26,200 --> 01:16:26,840
Um...

1690
01:16:26,840 --> 01:16:29,900
So, similar with original song, too.

1691
01:16:29,900 --> 01:16:32,080
Well, the original song, I had...

1692
01:16:32,080 --> 01:16:34,980
I was planning on doing it for next year.

1693
01:16:36,360 --> 01:16:37,640
But, plans.

1694
01:16:38,600 --> 01:16:39,200
Several.

1695
01:16:41,740 --> 01:16:42,760
New outfits.

1696
01:16:45,880 --> 01:16:48,020
1 million subscribers!

1697
01:16:49,600 --> 01:16:50,440
That's right.

1698
01:16:50,500 --> 01:16:51,240
It's a plan.

1699
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:52,360
It's not a goal.

1700
01:16:52,660 --> 01:16:55,420
We're gonna hit 1 million subscribers in 2025.

1701
01:16:55,760 --> 01:16:56,340
I believe it.

1702
01:16:56,400 --> 01:16:57,900
I believe we can hit...

1703
01:16:57,900 --> 01:17:00,780
I believe we can get 200k subscribers within a year.

1704
01:17:01,080 --> 01:17:05,240
I believe it.

1705
01:17:05,360 --> 01:17:07,340
I know we can do it.

1706
01:17:08,380 --> 01:17:09,020
Um...

1707
01:17:09,020 --> 01:17:11,640
More original merch.

1708
01:17:13,840 --> 01:17:16,900
Um, because we finally fixed our distribution issues.

1709
01:17:17,080 --> 01:17:26,360
We finally fixed our distribution issues, and we are partnering up with Gamersubs to help us with merch creations and distribution, so...

1710
01:17:26,360 --> 01:17:32,000
Um, we will finally have new merch that I know you guys will not have to wait 50 years to get.

1711
01:17:32,160 --> 01:17:33,360
It's time around.

1712
01:17:34,860 --> 01:17:35,420
Um...

1713
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:36,980
3D debut.

1714
01:17:38,240 --> 01:17:39,080
In 2025.

1715
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:42,560
Um...

1716
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:43,960
I think that's really...

1717
01:17:43,960 --> 01:17:48,300
I think that's like stuff that I know that's gonna be okay.

1718
01:17:48,640 --> 01:17:49,000
Oh, yeah!

1719
01:17:49,160 --> 01:17:50,420
More tournaments.

1720
01:17:53,280 --> 01:17:53,620
Yay!

1721
01:17:54,460 --> 01:17:58,500
I have zero... Some of you guys want to know if I have any plan on what I'm gonna do in February.

1722
01:17:58,700 --> 01:17:59,580
I have zero plans.

1723
01:17:59,720 --> 01:18:01,100
I have not planned anything out yet.

1724
01:18:02,400 --> 01:18:04,040
February might not be super...

1725
01:18:04,700 --> 01:18:11,200
You know, like, I would say I would say the first time I don't... I'm trying to figure out You know what?

1726
01:18:11,220 --> 01:18:11,360
No.

1727
01:18:11,500 --> 01:18:12,160
I'll do the stream.

1728
01:18:12,260 --> 01:18:17,360
I'm trying to figure out what date would be like the date that I want to be as my like, anniversary.

1729
01:18:18,700 --> 01:18:19,820
But like, I...

1730
01:18:19,820 --> 01:18:21,300
I don't know.

1731
01:18:21,520 --> 01:18:22,480
I'm trying to decide.

1732
01:18:22,560 --> 01:18:24,640
Is it like the tweet where I came back?

1733
01:18:24,820 --> 01:18:27,860
Or when I did my return stream?

1734
01:18:28,240 --> 01:18:35,100
So like, I'm using that as like my anniversary because I never really had a proper debut before.

1735
01:18:35,300 --> 01:18:37,240
I don't even know when I started streaming.

1736
01:18:37,800 --> 01:18:42,760
Like, I legitimately don't even remember when I actually started streaming.

1737
01:18:45,860 --> 01:18:49,740
So like, I've never really had like, a debut.

1738
01:18:50,200 --> 01:18:53,840
So like, I'm trying to figure out what is my like, anniversary stream.

1739
01:18:54,460 --> 01:18:55,880
What date would it be?

1740
01:18:57,100 --> 01:18:57,540
So...

1741
01:18:57,540 --> 01:18:59,680
I have nothing planned yet.

1742
01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:03,140
I have not figured out what the fuck I'm gonna be doing.

1743
01:19:04,960 --> 01:19:08,480
So like, most likely, it might not be that special.

1744
01:19:08,900 --> 01:19:12,340
Because like I said, because I have zero idea of what I'm doing.

1745
01:19:12,440 --> 01:19:13,020
Oh, 10 minute warning.

1746
01:19:13,100 --> 01:19:13,920
Thank you for the 10 minute warning.

1747
01:19:14,500 --> 01:19:17,440
No idea what like, what I'm actually gonna be doing.

1748
01:19:17,780 --> 01:19:19,760
It might not be like, super duper special.

1749
01:19:19,760 --> 01:19:24,880
But, I do have several really cute merch planned out for that day.

1750
01:19:25,260 --> 01:19:28,680
So like, um, that's like, something to look forward to.

1751
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:31,760
Like, cute merch that I'm planning on releasing on that day.

1752
01:19:32,240 --> 01:19:35,760
Um, like, new like, creative merch stuff.

1753
01:19:36,080 --> 01:19:38,900
But yeah, that's like, my 2025 plans.

1754
01:19:39,100 --> 01:19:42,000
I don't know like, what New Year's resolutions I would have.

1755
01:19:42,500 --> 01:19:43,760
Um, but...

1756
01:19:44,660 --> 01:19:45,180
2025?

1757
01:19:47,140 --> 01:19:47,720
Um...

1758
01:19:47,720 --> 01:19:50,980
I have several of these things in the works for that, for 2025.

1759
01:19:51,800 --> 01:19:53,960
Um, yeah, that's really...

1760
01:19:54,720 --> 01:19:55,880
That's really...

1761
01:19:55,880 --> 01:19:58,560
That's really... Oh my gosh, we had so many things that happened.

1762
01:19:58,660 --> 01:19:59,400
That's crazy.

1763
01:20:00,080 --> 01:20:00,660
Like...

1764
01:20:04,060 --> 01:20:05,220
That's actually...

1765
01:20:05,570 --> 01:20:07,480
That's actually crazy how...

1766
01:20:07,480 --> 01:20:09,680
How many things happened.

1767
01:20:10,160 --> 01:20:13,340
Like, just on my own channel alone, that I've done.

1768
01:20:13,760 --> 01:20:18,520
Um, because like, you know, usually like, lists like these are more so of like...

1769
01:20:18,520 --> 01:20:20,920
Well, for an indie, this is actually incredibly impressive.

1770
01:20:21,140 --> 01:20:21,640
Like, I...

1771
01:20:21,640 --> 01:20:24,720
Like I said, I couldn't have done all of this without you guys.

1772
01:20:24,920 --> 01:20:29,940
The fact that I was able to accomplish all of this as a fucking indie VTuber with no company behind me.

1773
01:20:30,120 --> 01:20:33,360
You see this list, like, for like, companies and stuff too.

1774
01:20:33,440 --> 01:20:36,980
Like, for not just like, one person, but like, as an overall group thing.

1775
01:20:37,080 --> 01:20:43,820
But the fact that you guys were able to like, support me so much to the fact that I could do all of this.

1776
01:20:44,320 --> 01:20:46,820
And like, do so much.

1777
01:20:47,520 --> 01:20:49,420
And have a career in this.

1778
01:20:49,540 --> 01:20:51,020
Like, thank you, Dragoons.

1779
01:20:51,140 --> 01:20:54,420
Like, what a fucking year it's been.

1780
01:20:54,640 --> 01:20:56,420
Like, actually.

1781
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:58,940
What a fucking year.

1782
01:21:00,500 --> 01:21:02,280
Crasher, thank you for the Akasupa!

1783
01:21:02,500 --> 01:21:03,500
Thank you, thank you!

1784
01:21:04,020 --> 01:21:05,660
Happy New Year, Doki.

1785
01:21:05,800 --> 01:21:09,440
You worked so hard to make awesome content for us and have accomplished so much.

1786
01:21:09,620 --> 01:21:13,820
I speak on behalf of us Dragoons and saying we appreciate everything you do.

1787
01:21:14,060 --> 01:21:14,880
And now we love you.

1788
01:21:14,960 --> 01:21:16,000
Thank you for the Akasupa.

1789
01:21:16,200 --> 01:21:16,920
Thank you, thank you.

1790
01:21:17,020 --> 01:21:19,040
Oh yeah, I guess that reminded me.

1791
01:21:20,900 --> 01:21:27,900
Delegate more tasks to staff so I can be more creative.

1792
01:21:31,680 --> 01:21:34,260
That's another thing that I'm gonna be doing.

1793
01:21:34,520 --> 01:21:44,760
I'm gonna finally delegate more stuff to my... to staff members so they can help me do all the behind-the-scenes paperwork and stuff for me.

1794
01:21:46,020 --> 01:21:48,100
I realized I need to...

1795
01:21:48,100 --> 01:21:50,620
I'm gonna fucking learn how to delegate.

1796
01:21:52,600 --> 01:21:55,000
Also, I just remembered another dad story.

1797
01:21:55,880 --> 01:22:14,280
While I was like... I think like two or three days ago, I was walking dad and there was a really pretty lady behind me and Doki Amber Doge saw that really pretty lady and he started whining.

1798
01:22:14,640 --> 01:22:18,900
Even I was like, whoa she's cute and then she's really pretty and cute.

1799
01:22:19,280 --> 01:22:35,620
He saw her and he started whining and was trying to look back at her and was like oh my god, that is a pretty, pretty lady and he was like and he kept like...

01:26:39,540 --> 01:26:44,160
but thank you all for submitting your Dragoon Sonas.

1814
01:26:44,780 --> 01:26:48,300
If you didn't make it this year, there's always next year.

1815
01:26:48,380 --> 01:26:50,880
I will be adding on to it more and more.

1816
01:26:51,560 --> 01:26:59,460
So if you submitted yours, I will add yours in for next year.

1817
01:27:00,100 --> 01:27:01,060
But yes, look!

1818
01:27:01,100 --> 01:27:03,020
I'm surrounded by all my Dragoons!

1819
01:27:03,100 --> 01:27:03,840
And you guys!

1820
01:27:04,180 --> 01:27:06,280
I'm surrounded by all of you guys!

1821
01:27:09,860 --> 01:27:13,580
Oh my god, there's so many different Dragoons here.

1822
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,300
There's so many different colors too.

1823
01:27:16,800 --> 01:27:23,500
Okay, there's so many... I didn't realize how popular Chonky Goons were.

1824
01:27:25,760 --> 01:27:28,400
The Chonky... The Dragoons...

1825
01:27:29,460 --> 01:27:34,160
There's so many... So many of you guys submitted Chonky Dragoon Sonas.

1826
01:27:38,320 --> 01:27:42,740
There were more Chonky Goons than regular Goons.

1827
01:27:43,100 --> 01:27:46,700
It was like Chonky Goons, long Goons, then regular Goons.

1828
01:27:47,400 --> 01:27:51,240
And then apparently, not a lot of people like being the eggs for some reason.

1829
01:27:54,180 --> 01:27:56,520
Love our Chonkiest life.

1830
01:27:57,020 --> 01:27:58,500
Oh my god, it's almost time!

1831
01:27:58,740 --> 01:28:01,000
There's almost a minute left, everybody!

1832
01:28:02,040 --> 01:28:03,460
Oh my god!

1833
01:28:03,700 --> 01:28:06,060
We're almost 60 seconds away!

1834
01:28:06,800 --> 01:28:08,580
Oh my god, here we go!

1835
01:28:08,900 --> 01:28:09,380
Here we go!

1836
01:28:12,340 --> 01:28:12,820
Oh!

1837
01:28:13,220 --> 01:28:13,940
The countdown!

1838
01:28:14,420 --> 01:28:15,520
The official countdown!

1839
01:28:18,430 --> 01:28:21,630
Oh my god, we're almost there!

1840
01:28:22,210 --> 01:28:24,410
I think... Oh my god!

1841
01:28:25,170 --> 01:28:26,930
50 seconds left!

1842
01:28:27,370 --> 01:28:30,190
Okay, maybe this was a little fast, but like, it's okay.

1843
01:28:35,830 --> 01:28:36,750
40 seconds!

1844
01:28:38,370 --> 01:28:38,830
30!

1845
01:28:39,270 --> 01:28:40,670
Okay, this is a little faster.

1846
01:28:40,790 --> 01:28:42,730
I might have timed it incorrectly, but it's okay.

1847
01:28:42,830 --> 01:28:46,470
We're gonna be like... We're gonna wish this is an early happy new year.

1848
01:28:49,090 --> 01:28:50,730
Okay, there we go.

1849
01:28:50,830 --> 01:28:52,070
I gave a little pause.

1850
01:28:52,250 --> 01:28:53,110
Alright, 20!

1851
01:28:53,610 --> 01:28:54,590
20 seconds!

1852
01:28:54,930 --> 01:28:55,570
Here we go!

1853
01:28:55,790 --> 01:28:56,450
Here we go!

1854
01:28:56,510 --> 01:28:58,110
We're almost at 10 seconds!

1855
01:28:58,110 --> 01:29:00,790
Okay, we're definitely... Okay, there we go.

1856
01:29:00,850 --> 01:29:01,910
We're at 10 seconds!

1857
01:29:02,490 --> 01:29:12,270
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1!

1858
01:29:12,630 --> 01:29:14,450
HAPPY NEW YEAR!

1859
01:29:18,060 --> 01:29:20,560
HAPPY NEW YEAR, EVERYONE!

1860
01:29:22,830 --> 01:29:23,980
HAPPY 2025!

1861
01:29:23,980 --> 01:29:24,440
2025!

1862
01:29:31,400 --> 01:29:36,160
Oh my god, we're all here for the new year!

1863
01:29:41,320 --> 01:29:43,640
Happy new year, everybody!

1864
01:29:44,280 --> 01:29:47,680
See, I told you it was timed perfectly, everyone.

1865
01:29:47,940 --> 01:29:48,880
It was timed...

1866
01:29:48,880 --> 01:29:51,260
I didn't fuck up the timing.

1867
01:29:54,720 --> 01:29:57,120
HAPPY NEW YEAR, DRAGONS!

1868
01:29:57,120 --> 01:29:58,740
HAPPY 2025!

1869
01:29:59,640 --> 01:30:01,720
A new year with all of you guys.

1870
01:30:01,940 --> 01:30:05,460
An official new start for Doki Bird.

1871
01:30:07,300 --> 01:30:13,600
I might return in February in 2024, but 2025 is gonna be our year.

1872
01:30:13,900 --> 01:30:15,260
Our actual year.

1873
01:30:17,040 --> 01:30:20,000
I finally figured out the company stuff.

1874
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:25,060
I finally... merch is finally actually gonna be real now.

1875
01:30:25,180 --> 01:30:27,380
We're gonna finally have merch plans.

1876
01:30:27,800 --> 01:30:30,760
We fixed up all the logistics of everything.

1877
01:30:31,580 --> 01:30:35,420
I'm delegating... I'm starting to learn how to delegate more now.

1878
01:30:36,840 --> 01:30:41,940
2025 will be a year where everything is figured...

1879
01:30:41,940 --> 01:30:47,520
Not everything is figured out, but like, a lot of stuff is figured out, so it's gonna be more smooth sailing.

1880
01:30:47,520 --> 01:30:50,240
And I want to do more things for you, dragons.

1881
01:30:50,640 --> 01:30:55,980
And I want to do more stuff for you guys and make you guys proud of me.

1882
01:30:56,340 --> 01:30:57,880
You guys have to be proud of me.

1883
01:30:58,180 --> 01:30:59,480
Have a great time.

1884
01:31:00,320 --> 01:31:02,620
Making me as your oshi worth it.

1885
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:06,640
And give you guys lots of happy memories and laughter for 2025.

1886
01:31:07,380 --> 01:31:10,020
Mostly happy memories, I hope, this time.

1887
01:31:13,040 --> 01:31:17,500
I mean, I get to do a countdown with you guys, so we're starting off strong already.

1888
01:31:22,040 --> 01:31:25,680
Yeah, I want to make you all proud.

1889
01:31:26,120 --> 01:31:29,220
I want to make you all happy and laugh with me and everything.

1890
01:31:29,960 --> 01:31:34,280
And I kind of wouldn't be here without the support of all my dragons.

1891
01:31:35,160 --> 01:31:40,640
And without your help and without you guys keeping me company.

1892
01:31:41,600 --> 01:31:46,500
I'm happy to be here to celebrate the new year with all of you.

1893
01:31:47,280 --> 01:31:51,340
You know, you're like my family.

1894
01:31:53,480 --> 01:32:02,040
I feel like I celebrate a lot of my accomplishments and memories and happy moments with all of you guys.

1895
01:32:02,620 --> 01:32:07,600
And I'm really happy that you guys are part of my journey.

1896
01:32:08,100 --> 01:32:13,340
You're part of my journey and you're here for my highs and lows.

1897
01:32:13,340 --> 01:32:15,540
And thank you, everybody.

1898
01:32:15,740 --> 01:32:16,620
Thank you, dragons.

1899
01:32:17,160 --> 01:32:23,520
I'm so happy that you're my community and that you're my fans.

1900
01:32:24,100 --> 01:32:29,520
And honestly, you guys deserve to be the best fan base of the year.

1901
01:32:29,800 --> 01:32:34,960
Because anyone who has a fan base like you guys are so fucking lucky.

1902
01:32:35,860 --> 01:32:38,980
And I'm the luckiest VTuber in the world.

1903
01:32:42,940 --> 01:32:44,120
So thank you.

1904
01:32:44,260 --> 01:32:46,560
Thank you for all the super chats and everything.

1905
01:32:46,800 --> 01:32:48,660
I really appreciate it, guys.

1906
01:32:49,300 --> 01:32:53,180
I hope 2025 will be a lot better year for all of us.

1907
01:32:54,560 --> 01:32:56,920
And that we make even more memories.

1908
01:32:57,100 --> 01:33:03,180
And I cannot wait to see what I'll be up to throughout the next couple of months.

1909
01:33:04,480 --> 01:33:09,820
And what's gonna happen in the new year for us.

1910
01:33:09,900 --> 01:33:11,500
So yes, happy new year.

1911
01:33:11,860 --> 01:33:12,600
Happy new year.

1912
01:33:12,680 --> 01:33:14,000
Thank you all for the Akasupa.

1913
01:33:14,340 --> 01:33:15,660
I really appreciate it.

1914
01:33:15,760 --> 01:33:19,960
Thank you all for subscribing, for the super chats, and everything.

1915
01:33:20,920 --> 01:33:22,700
It means a lot, guys.

1916
01:33:23,040 --> 01:33:24,840
Billy, thank you for the Akasupa.

1917
01:33:25,080 --> 01:33:26,000
Thank you, thank you.

1918
01:33:26,160 --> 01:33:27,180
Happy new year, Doki.

1919
01:33:27,320 --> 01:33:28,500
See you in a couple of weeks.

1920
01:33:28,600 --> 01:33:29,600
Happy new year.

1921
01:33:29,920 --> 01:33:31,520
JP, thank you for the Akasupa.

1922
01:33:31,760 --> 01:33:32,780
Thank you, thank you.

1923
01:33:32,780 --> 01:33:33,700
Happy new year.

1924
01:33:34,660 --> 01:33:36,180
Proud to be a Dragoon.

1925
01:33:36,280 --> 01:33:37,640
Thank you for the Akasupa.

1926
01:33:37,980 --> 01:33:38,960
Thank you, thank you.

1927
01:33:39,200 --> 01:33:40,720
David, thank you for the Akasupa.

1928
01:33:40,900 --> 01:33:41,660
Thank you, thank you.

1929
01:33:41,740 --> 01:33:43,200
Happy new year.

1930
01:33:43,400 --> 01:33:44,660
Happy new year.

1931
01:33:46,300 --> 01:33:48,200
Oh wait, I'll show you guys a little something.

1932
01:33:50,520 --> 01:33:53,740
I wanted to release this earlier.

1933
01:33:53,740 --> 01:33:55,740
I don't know...

1934
01:33:56,520 --> 01:34:01,740
Because one of the first merch that we're planning on releasing...

1935
01:34:04,760 --> 01:34:05,960
With Gamersubs...

1936
01:34:07,580 --> 01:34:10,960
Oh my gosh, I know I saved this picture somewhere.

1937
01:34:12,380 --> 01:34:14,860
I'll show you guys a preview of it.

1938
01:34:14,860 --> 01:34:16,860
But like...

1939
01:34:17,380 --> 01:34:24,240
It was supposed to be for Lunar New Year.

1940
01:34:24,480 --> 01:34:27,220
I don't know if we can get it in time before then.

1941
01:34:27,360 --> 01:34:30,220
So I need to ask if it's possible.

1942
01:34:30,780 --> 01:34:33,100
If not...

1943
01:34:34,620 --> 01:34:38,500
If not, you're gonna have to use it for next Lunar New Year.

1944
01:34:39,820 --> 01:34:40,820
I'm sorry.

1945
01:34:47,040 --> 01:34:49,300
But let me grab it real quick.

1946
01:34:49,540 --> 01:34:53,740
I didn't save the file, so I need to grab it right now.

1947
01:34:56,500 --> 01:35:00,360
But this is basically what it looks like.

1948
01:35:00,700 --> 01:35:01,300
Wait, let me see.

1949
01:35:01,360 --> 01:35:02,180
This is what it looks like.

1950
01:35:02,260 --> 01:35:04,240
This is what it looks like, everyone.

1951
01:35:04,700 --> 01:35:05,620
Let me save the picture.

1952
01:35:06,100 --> 01:35:08,080
I didn't save the picture too, by the way.

1953
01:35:08,640 --> 01:35:10,180
There's a lot of things I didn't do.

1954
01:35:12,040 --> 01:35:14,240
I was like, do I show this?

1955
01:35:14,240 --> 01:35:16,140
Do I show you guys this?

1956
01:35:16,280 --> 01:35:20,680
I literally just decided on the spot to be like, no, I'll show it to you guys.

1957
01:35:21,220 --> 01:35:24,620
But yes, this is the next collection.

1958
01:35:25,840 --> 01:35:32,380
The next Lunar Red Pocket Envelopes collection.

1959
01:35:33,060 --> 01:35:34,540
I thought it was really cute.

1960
01:35:35,400 --> 01:35:35,720
Hehe.

1961
01:35:39,880 --> 01:35:51,720
And now that we have Gamersubs doing the distribution, you guys will definitely not have to wait more than 7 plus months for your merch.

1962
01:35:51,960 --> 01:35:54,620
So it's definitely gonna be a lot faster now.

1963
01:35:56,420 --> 01:35:59,100
So I'm really happy about that.

1964
01:35:59,100 --> 01:36:10,580
But this is gonna be like set 2 of the Lunar New Year Red Pocket Envelope merch that I'm planning on releasing for 2025.

1965
01:36:12,840 --> 01:36:14,460
But Alice, thank you for the superchat.

1966
01:36:14,520 --> 01:36:14,980
Thank you, thank you.

1967
01:36:15,020 --> 01:36:15,840
Happy New Year, Dougie.

1968
01:36:15,860 --> 01:36:16,580
Thank you.

1969
01:36:16,880 --> 01:36:18,200
Thank you, everybody.

1970
01:36:19,740 --> 01:36:21,400
So yeah, I'm really happy.

1971
01:36:21,520 --> 01:36:23,000
They're gonna be running my store now.

1972
01:36:23,220 --> 01:36:24,520
It's not gonna be on the Gamersubs website.

1973
01:36:24,600 --> 01:36:26,780
It's gonna be on my own shop website and everything.

1974
01:36:26,780 --> 01:36:32,360
So I'm really looking forward to 2025 when it comes to merch distribution and everything.

1975
01:36:32,540 --> 01:36:35,160
And the creative things I really want to do for you guys.

1976
01:36:35,280 --> 01:36:37,080
For your Dougie Shrine and everything.

1977
01:36:38,400 --> 01:36:39,920
And yeah, there's so many plans.

1978
01:36:40,040 --> 01:36:42,080
So many new infrastructures being put in.

1979
01:36:42,760 --> 01:36:47,620
And I'm still trying to figure out stuff as I go along.

1980
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:50,260
Oshiso, thank you for the superchat.

1981
01:36:50,320 --> 01:36:50,840
Thank you, thank you.

1982
01:36:51,160 --> 01:36:53,700
Dougie, my Kami, Oshi, I'm so lucky to be a Dragoon.

1983
01:36:53,940 --> 01:36:56,460
I just started college in a foreign country far from home.

1984
01:36:56,540 --> 01:36:58,280
And you guys gave me a place to belong.

1985
01:36:58,400 --> 01:37:00,340
I dare say I look up to you so much.

1986
01:37:00,420 --> 01:37:01,600
Love you lots, my homies.

1987
01:37:01,660 --> 01:37:02,520
Thank you for the superchat.

1988
01:37:02,600 --> 01:37:03,480
Thank you, thank you.

1989
01:37:03,740 --> 01:37:06,020
I think you Dragoons are a great community.

1990
01:37:06,280 --> 01:37:08,680
You're so welcoming to like so many...

1991
01:37:08,680 --> 01:37:10,780
You're so welcoming to a lot of people.

1992
01:37:11,340 --> 01:37:12,880
New fans, old fans.

1993
01:37:12,980 --> 01:37:14,300
We have so many of you guys.

1994
01:37:15,060 --> 01:37:15,920
Thank you everybody.

1995
01:37:16,060 --> 01:37:18,020
Thank you for putting up with my Marble Rivals addictions.

1996
01:37:18,180 --> 01:37:19,280
I really appreciate it.

1997
01:37:19,400 --> 01:37:20,120
This is what I say.

1998
01:37:20,940 --> 01:37:23,740
Bark Knights will remember my Apex Legends addiction.

1999
01:37:27,440 --> 01:37:34,520
The Bark Knights, when they see the Dragoons being like, oh my god.

2000
01:37:37,080 --> 01:37:39,660
Seeing Dragoons being like, is she okay?

2001
01:37:39,760 --> 01:37:41,720
Regarding my Marble Rivals addiction.

2002
01:37:42,540 --> 01:37:45,660
The Bark Knights are just like, first time.

2003
01:37:45,840 --> 01:37:47,280
Because they went through my Apex...

2004
01:37:47,280 --> 01:37:50,000
They were there for my Apex Legends addiction.

2005
01:37:53,820 --> 01:37:56,440
They were there for it.

2006
01:37:56,760 --> 01:38:01,340
But like, you guys are like a lot more fortunate.

2007
01:38:02,120 --> 01:38:07,020
Because sometimes I don't even stream for months because of my addiction.

2008
01:38:09,880 --> 01:38:15,600
Now I'm actually... I would disappear and just play Apex.

2009
01:38:17,400 --> 01:38:24,220
I would actually just disappear for months and I'd be like, sorry guys, I'm back now.

2010
01:38:29,880 --> 01:38:32,740
And the Bark Knights were still there.

2011
01:38:33,060 --> 01:38:36,020
They were still there.

2012
01:38:37,140 --> 01:38:39,300
Minnie, thank you for the very first super chat.

2013
01:38:39,380 --> 01:38:40,200
Thank you, thank you.

2014
01:38:40,580 --> 01:38:44,100
It's been a wild ride, but I'm happy to be part of it.

2015
01:38:44,220 --> 01:38:45,200
Keep being awesome, Doki.

2016
01:38:45,300 --> 01:38:46,880
And I look forward to future shenanigans.

2017
01:38:47,400 --> 01:38:48,540
Thank you for the super chat.

2018
01:38:48,540 --> 01:38:50,680
Your very first super chat too, Minnie.

2019
01:38:50,780 --> 01:38:52,440
I really appreciate it.

2020
01:38:52,780 --> 01:38:55,300
Thank you so much, guys.

2021
01:38:55,560 --> 01:38:56,820
Thank you, thank you.

2022
01:38:56,980 --> 01:39:02,940
Oh my god, I wish I had some of my old clips and everything of like, when I used to stream.

2023
01:39:07,280 --> 01:39:09,500
I privated a lot of stuff.

2024
01:39:10,140 --> 01:39:12,680
Or like, I don't have clips of it anymore.

2025
01:39:12,760 --> 01:39:15,080
It's on my old PC and stuff.

2026
01:39:15,140 --> 01:39:17,880
I wish I could show you guys, but it's on my old PC.

2027
01:39:18,080 --> 01:39:24,300
The stuff that remains are like... I guess like they're just...

2028
01:39:24,300 --> 01:39:28,820
You'd find like random clips like from a long time ago.

2029
01:39:29,820 --> 01:39:31,420
Lost Media, yeah.

2030
01:39:31,780 --> 01:39:35,120
No, the ones that I privated, they're like...

2031
01:39:35,120 --> 01:39:36,880
I don't want to un-private them.

2032
01:39:40,900 --> 01:39:43,360
They're like, I don't want to un-private them.

2033
01:39:48,120 --> 01:39:51,900
But yeah, happy new year, everybody.

2034
01:39:52,100 --> 01:39:53,040
Happy new year.

2035
01:39:53,420 --> 01:39:55,340
I hope you guys had a great new year.

2036
01:39:55,560 --> 01:39:57,280
It's 2025 now.

2037
01:39:59,140 --> 01:40:04,180
And I'm happy that I'm celebrating opening up the new year with you guys, as always.

2038
01:40:06,580 --> 01:40:07,580
Happy new year, Doki.

2039
01:40:07,720 --> 01:40:09,940
Thank you for the amazing year.

2040
01:40:10,480 --> 01:40:13,380
You have helped me improve my life a thousand times at this point.

2041
01:40:13,500 --> 01:40:15,020
I'm so proud to be a Dragoon.

2042
01:40:15,140 --> 01:40:16,680
Here's more laughs in 2025.

2043
01:40:17,160 --> 01:40:18,400
Thank you for the superchat, Naino.

2044
01:40:18,660 --> 01:40:19,920
Thank you, thank you.

2045
01:40:20,140 --> 01:40:21,240
Thank you, everybody.

2046
01:40:22,140 --> 01:40:24,160
Yeah, this is our New York City.

2047
01:40:24,340 --> 01:40:25,060
Oh my gosh.

2048
01:40:25,180 --> 01:40:33,520
I saw a video of the New York City people who are running to get a good spot for the New York City ball drop.

2049
01:40:33,660 --> 01:40:35,900
That shit looks fucking scary.

2050
01:40:38,800 --> 01:40:41,080
I was like the stampede.

2051
01:40:41,280 --> 01:40:42,800
I'm like, oh my god.

2052
01:40:43,580 --> 01:40:43,940
Like...

2053
01:40:47,080 --> 01:40:47,440
Oh,

2054
01:40:51,020 --> 01:40:51,720
thank you for the superchat.

2055
01:40:51,820 --> 01:40:52,580
Thank you, thank you.

2056
01:40:52,640 --> 01:40:56,220
I may not be on the Dragon Towers, but I'm still happy regardless.

2057
01:40:56,440 --> 01:40:59,180
I'm happy that you're my Kamiyoshi and I wish you the best for this and next year.

2058
01:40:59,240 --> 01:40:59,900
Thank you for the superchat.

2059
01:41:00,020 --> 01:41:00,980
Thank you, thank you.

2060
01:41:01,440 --> 01:41:02,080
Yeah, me too.

2061
01:41:02,220 --> 01:41:05,760
I'm excited for what this new year is gonna bring.

2062
01:41:06,580 --> 01:41:11,440
And I'm excited for whatever I'm gonna be doing for this year.

2063
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:21,380
Even if I fall off in 2025, at least I have the memories of all the great things that happened.

2064
01:41:25,480 --> 01:41:32,060
I'm okay if I fall off, because I still have you guys there.

2065
01:41:32,340 --> 01:41:36,360
Not even if a lot of you guys leave, I still have some of you guys.

2066
01:41:40,040 --> 01:41:41,580
That's all that matters.

2067
01:41:42,080 --> 01:41:47,440
As long as I still have dragons supporting me, I'll keep going for you guys.

2068
01:41:47,720 --> 01:41:48,760
But not for 50 years.

2069
01:41:48,920 --> 01:41:53,260
I don't want a VTube when I'm like 90.

2070
01:41:53,500 --> 01:41:54,620
I don't want it.

2071
01:41:54,680 --> 01:41:56,080
Or 100 plus.

2072
01:41:58,960 --> 01:42:11,280
I said 50 years and I said 90 as if I'm like 40 years old.

2073
01:42:11,340 --> 01:42:12,860
I am not 40 years old.

2074
01:42:15,040 --> 01:42:20,300
I want you guys to know I am not 40.

2075
01:42:21,040 --> 01:42:23,300
I just can't do math.

2076
01:42:27,600 --> 01:42:29,040
I'm sorry.

2077
01:42:29,140 --> 01:42:30,480
I'm not a hag.

2078
01:42:30,560 --> 01:42:32,100
I'm sorry to break.

2079
01:42:32,240 --> 01:42:34,080
I'm sorry to ruin your dreams.

2080
01:42:35,380 --> 01:42:37,180
I'm not a hag.

2081
01:42:37,340 --> 01:42:38,300
I'm virtual.

2082
01:42:40,040 --> 01:42:41,300
Not a hag.

2083
01:42:41,920 --> 01:42:44,400
I can pretend though.

2084
01:42:45,390 --> 01:42:50,740
Guys, I used to own a Nintendo 64.

2085
01:42:52,160 --> 01:42:53,640
That's the thing, right?

2086
01:42:54,920 --> 01:42:56,940
The one that's before GameCube?

2087
01:42:57,040 --> 01:43:02,640
Guys, I totally owned a Nintendo 64 and played games on it.

2088
01:43:02,640 --> 01:43:08,380
Like Mario Super Sunshine Mario.

2089
01:43:11,540 --> 01:43:15,260
No, Ducky!

2090
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:18,440
Ducky, no!

2091
01:43:18,540 --> 01:43:20,100
You're hurting us more!

2092
01:43:21,560 --> 01:43:30,800
Guys, do you remember the time when phones had wires and they were called landlines?

2093
01:43:30,800 --> 01:43:31,380
Remember?

2094
01:43:31,760 --> 01:43:39,040
Oh my god, I would go to the other room and then the landline would get caught on the door and everything.

2095
01:43:39,040 --> 01:43:47,040
And then, like, you know, instead of Discord, we would have... AIM?

2096
01:44:00,820 --> 01:44:06,640
And then, guys, remember watching those movies from Tom Hanks called You Got Mail?

2097
01:44:10,480 --> 01:44:11,120
Stop!

2098
01:44:13,980 --> 01:44:16,020
Oh wait, no, AOL, sorry!

2099
01:44:16,420 --> 01:44:18,560
Sorry, AOL, yeah, yeah.

2100
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:27,060
Yeah, as a fellow hag, we would use that AOL and we would go LOL all the time.

2101
01:44:27,060 --> 01:44:31,920
And, like, turning to dust.

2102
01:44:34,460 --> 01:44:37,220
A 1998 movie.

2103
01:44:37,860 --> 01:44:42,290
Yeah, guys, remember going to theaters to watch You Got Mail, everybody?

2104
01:44:45,120 --> 01:44:48,480
Yeah, everyone.

2105
01:44:48,940 --> 01:44:50,320
And then we would use AOL.

2106
01:44:50,840 --> 01:44:53,100
Oh my gosh, and TeamSpeak too.

2107
01:44:53,620 --> 01:44:55,460
Those were the days.

2108
01:44:55,460 --> 01:44:57,180
Using TeamSpeak.

2109
01:44:57,320 --> 01:45:01,820
And then, like, before Twitch, we had Justin.TV.

2110
01:45:02,200 --> 01:45:04,620
That's where... And then Ice Poseidon.

2111
01:45:06,300 --> 01:45:10,340
Oh my god, I shouldn't give him any publicity.

2112
01:45:10,900 --> 01:45:12,620
He does not deserve any of it.

2113
01:45:12,780 --> 01:45:18,180
Before we had... Before you guys had... What's his name?

2114
01:45:18,340 --> 01:45:21,080
Oh my god, who is that fucking controversial guy now?

2115
01:45:21,440 --> 01:45:25,080
Aiden... Oh yeah, before we had Aiden Ross, we had Ice Poseidon.

2116
01:45:25,460 --> 01:45:28,680
I don't know, sorry.

2117
01:45:32,740 --> 01:45:41,280
Oh my god, those names.

2118
01:45:43,440 --> 01:45:49,800
Anyway, never speak their names.

2119
01:45:50,900 --> 01:45:52,560
Don't keep... Stop!

2120
01:45:53,340 --> 01:45:53,980
Stop!

2121
01:45:54,120 --> 01:45:55,540
We get it now!

2122
01:45:56,440 --> 01:45:58,100
Anyway, happy new year!

2123
01:45:58,440 --> 01:45:59,860
Sorry for ruining the moment.

2124
01:46:00,620 --> 01:46:01,860
Guys, I'm so sorry.

2125
01:46:02,320 --> 01:46:05,540
I'm so sorry for ruining the moment, everybody.

2126
01:46:05,820 --> 01:46:12,320
We were so sentimental and everything, and then now I made you... I'm sorry for hurting you.

2127
01:46:19,060 --> 01:46:20,300
Anyway, guys.

2128
01:46:21,340 --> 01:46:24,220
I hope you guys enjoyed my HAG roleplay.

2129
01:46:24,340 --> 01:46:25,060
Did I do good?

2130
01:46:25,780 --> 01:46:28,840
For all the HAG enjoyers, was I accurate?

2131
01:46:29,580 --> 01:46:30,520
Was I immersive?

2132
01:46:31,340 --> 01:46:34,920
Was I... Was I... Was I at least immersive?

2133
01:46:35,320 --> 01:46:35,700
No.

2134
01:46:35,700 --> 01:46:41,940
What do you mean?

2135
01:46:42,060 --> 01:46:46,740
I talked about landlines and Nintendo 64!

2136
01:46:48,660 --> 01:46:52,780
How am I... How is that not immersive?

2137
01:46:54,420 --> 01:46:56,760
Not even close.

2138
01:46:57,940 --> 01:47:01,680
That guy enjoyed the roleplay.

2139
01:47:01,760 --> 01:47:03,140
That was like, you know what?

2140
01:47:03,320 --> 01:47:04,480
No, I'm definitely immersed.

2141
01:47:04,660 --> 01:47:06,920
Here's a membership.

2142
01:47:08,780 --> 01:47:10,360
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

2143
01:47:10,360 --> 01:47:11,000
You did great.

2144
01:47:11,160 --> 01:47:12,300
Thank you for enabling me.

2145
01:47:12,400 --> 01:47:13,820
I really appreciate it.

2146
01:47:13,820 --> 01:47:16,760
I'm not Dreamcast.

2147
01:47:17,220 --> 01:47:20,380
Hey, what the fuck's a Dreamcast?

2148
01:47:21,920 --> 01:47:26,300
That's the one for the... Oh, that's the Sega one, right?

2149
01:47:26,360 --> 01:47:26,980
Is that Sega?

2150
01:47:27,640 --> 01:47:29,660
Oh my god, I just found out.

2151
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:38,800
I'm just... Guys, I just found out that Sonic the Hedgehog is not popular in Japan.

2152
01:47:38,800 --> 01:47:41,960
They like... That reminded me.

2153
01:47:42,780 --> 01:47:45,800
I broke my heart in less...

2154
01:47:46,600 --> 01:47:48,800
No, I know what Dreamcast is!

2155
01:47:48,860 --> 01:47:50,080
I had to think about it.

2156
01:47:50,120 --> 01:47:51,760
I was like, oh yeah, it's the one with Sega.

2157
01:47:52,660 --> 01:47:54,320
But yes, did you guys know that?

2158
01:47:54,380 --> 01:47:57,500
Did you guys know Sonic the Hedgehog is not popular in Japan?

2159
01:47:57,960 --> 01:48:00,920
And that Sonic was made for the western audiences?

2160
01:48:01,500 --> 01:48:02,980
It literally... It bombed.

2161
01:48:03,060 --> 01:48:06,560
It bombed in the box office in Japan.

2162
01:48:06,560 --> 01:48:12,060
Like, I'm not... Like, he is not popular in Japan.

2163
01:48:12,240 --> 01:48:14,100
I did not know that.

2164
01:48:14,500 --> 01:48:17,560
Yeah, the movie actually bombed in Japan.

2165
01:48:19,580 --> 01:48:21,700
Yeah, I saw that on Twitter.

2166
01:48:22,380 --> 01:48:25,580
Like, literally, Sonic was made for western audiences.

2167
01:48:25,920 --> 01:48:27,660
It wasn't made for...

2168
01:48:27,660 --> 01:48:30,260
It wasn't made for like, foreign audiences.

2169
01:48:30,340 --> 01:48:31,520
Yeah, I didn't know that!

2170
01:48:32,060 --> 01:48:33,740
I just found that out today.

2171
01:48:33,740 --> 01:48:35,940
Or yesterday, when it was trending on Twitter.

2172
01:48:36,860 --> 01:48:38,880
I mean, Shadow has a gun.

2173
01:48:42,720 --> 01:48:44,060
That's just true.

2174
01:48:44,420 --> 01:48:46,740
They gave Shadow a fucking gun.

2175
01:48:52,780 --> 01:48:54,320
Yeah, that's true.

2176
01:48:54,700 --> 01:48:55,100
That's true.

2177
01:48:55,200 --> 01:48:57,760
He literally protected the president of the United...

2178
01:48:57,760 --> 01:48:58,840
Bro, okay!

2179
01:48:59,580 --> 01:49:03,860
Shadow's game is literally him protecting the president of the United States.

2180
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:06,040
Like, I mean...

2181
01:49:06,500 --> 01:49:08,840
I mean, yeah, it was definitely not cute.

2182
01:49:09,020 --> 01:49:11,040
It was definitely cute towards Americans.

2183
01:49:14,800 --> 01:49:17,240
Shadow is a true American.

2184
01:49:20,760 --> 01:49:23,200
Anyway, that's a little fun fact I gave.

2185
01:49:23,340 --> 01:49:26,460
The first fun fact of 2025 that I gave you guys.

2186
01:49:27,760 --> 01:49:29,700
Shadow has that edge.

2187
01:49:30,520 --> 01:49:33,220
Anyway, I hope you guys enjoyed the fun fact.

2188
01:49:33,600 --> 01:49:36,760
They based Sonic's personality on Bill Clinton?!

2189
01:49:38,500 --> 01:49:39,700
Wait, real?

2190
01:49:39,820 --> 01:49:41,060
There's no way!

2191
01:49:45,440 --> 01:49:47,880
There's no fucking way.

2192
01:49:49,500 --> 01:49:50,360
Wait...

2193
01:49:50,790 --> 01:49:51,480
Oh, wait.

2194
01:49:51,560 --> 01:49:56,520
Sonic's colors were chosen to match Sega's Cobalt Blue logo.

2195
01:49:56,960 --> 01:50:04,980
And his red and white shoes were inspired by the cover of Michael Jackson's 1987 album, Bad.

2196
01:50:05,300 --> 01:50:15,120
His personality was based on the then-governor of Arkansas, Bill Clinton's can-do attitude.

2197
01:50:15,120 --> 01:50:18,400
To be fair, his fucking favorite food is chili dogs.

2198
01:50:18,580 --> 01:50:23,520
Like, that is the most American thing you can do.

2199
01:50:24,060 --> 01:50:26,240
Oh my god, this is on Wikipedia!

2200
01:50:29,200 --> 01:50:31,380
He was even president then!

2201
01:50:31,800 --> 01:50:33,420
He was even president then!

2202
01:50:33,520 --> 01:50:37,020
He just was like, bro, I'm gonna fucking base this off of the governor of Arkansas.

2203
01:50:37,260 --> 01:50:41,120
Who the fuck would be... of Arkansas?!

2204
01:50:42,560 --> 01:50:44,540
That's so random.

2205
01:50:45,120 --> 01:50:48,260
Alright, first fun fact of 2025!

2206
01:50:49,080 --> 01:50:51,680
Guys, it all makes sense now.

2207
01:50:52,100 --> 01:50:56,840
Alright guys, I hope you guys have a wonderful New Year.

2208
01:50:57,280 --> 01:51:00,340
I hope you enjoyed my first fun fact of 2025.

2209
01:51:02,240 --> 01:51:04,240
Happy New Year, Dragoons.

2210
01:51:04,940 --> 01:51:08,260
What a way to kickstart 2025.

2211
01:51:10,400 --> 01:51:13,280
Let's hope for an even better year than 2024.

2212
01:51:13,280 --> 01:51:15,440
I look forward to it, Dragoons.

2213
01:51:16,180 --> 01:51:18,220
And to many, many more years together.

2214
01:51:18,820 --> 01:51:20,080
I'll see you guys next time.

2215
01:51:20,140 --> 01:51:21,760
As always, everybody...

2216
01:51:21,760 --> 01:51:26,180
Stay hydrated, posture check, get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

2217
01:51:26,380 --> 01:51:31,060
And if you, except for me, head to bed, cause you deserve it.

2218
01:51:31,380 --> 01:51:32,840
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

2219
01:51:33,460 --> 01:51:34,280
Bye guys!

2220
01:51:34,880 --> 01:51:35,400
Bye!
