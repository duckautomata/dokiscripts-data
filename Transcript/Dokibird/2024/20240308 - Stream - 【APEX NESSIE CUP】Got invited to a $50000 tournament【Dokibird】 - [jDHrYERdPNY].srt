him before.

12
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:10,290
So...

13
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:11,070
Wait, what team are we?

14
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:12,290
Team 6?

15
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:13,390
Yeah, we're Team 6.

16
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:14,490
Wait, we Hyrule.

17
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:15,310
We got Countdown.

18
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:16,710
We got Countdown?

19
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:17,490
Not so.

20
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:19,770
Wait, that's pretty good.

21
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:21,250
Pretty good.

22
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:24,910
We were, like, discussing Strats earlier.

23
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:28,030
So, is the, is the, is the, is like, the challenge is public
yet?

24
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:32,490
Or is it, like, still, like, only on stream?

25
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:33,430
type deal.

26
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:35,810
I had the thing open on my stream.

27
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:36,230
Oh, okay.

28
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:37,610
I'm just going to put it on my.

29
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:39,810
Oh my God, I can put images on my stream now.

30
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:43,710
I wasn't able to in the past.

31
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:48,890
But yeah, we were discussing our challenges, what we're
doing and stuff.

32
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:51,930
So have we decided who's going to be doing what yet?

33
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:55,970
Um, can we put them again?

34
00:01:56,550 --> 00:02:01,450
No, I mean, for the most part, I think the only individual
ones that matter is the FOV and no attachments.

35
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:01,970
Yeah.

36
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:09,850
can do whatever you just pick up like a sniper you just do
whatever so like we we delegated heme to be the 90 fov

37
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:19,510
because she's not streaming so so so chat she doesn't have a
chat to go through 90 fov and other than that we try to

38
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:23,110
decide who's going to do the no attachments and the p20 gun

39
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:35,400
any volunteers who's playing wraith who's going to get the
kidnap off i think senox is doing the the RAFE thing right

40
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:43,080
oh beautiful yeah oh my gosh also wait there's a comp
challenge in here too yeah it's not gonna be Fortik yeah but

41
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:49,540
it's just one point because it's like either you do the
raise or you do you get you get like one point off of the

42
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:59,060
the comp uh how much what what are they there's only one
wraith one also right yeah there's only one race so it's

43
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:05,620
either one or the I feel like I think Sunrise is right Just
do like our own comp because like For the ammo and the

44
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:16,800
shield cells And all that Definitely enough Yeah Hold on I'm
being cringe I'm getting a loop path That's not good I think

45
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:23,980
it's PY's changing every game right I don't think so well
it's different I think maybe world's edge we get like

46
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:31,340
Countdown the entire time and then Storm Point We get like a
different Obviously, different POI.

47
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:34,040
I mean, we could always ask tempo.

48
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:39,610
Also, chat, how's the volume for everybody?

49
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:41,490
I hate audio balancing.

50
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:47,830
Oh, guys, this is not bingo.

51
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:52,410
It's basically whoever does the most challenges per game.

52
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:55,190
Or win the game gets, like, money.

53
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:58,030
Gets, like, 1,500 per team.

54
00:03:59,050 --> 00:03:59,910
So it's not bingo.

55
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:01,670
It's just whoever does the most challenges.

56
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,360
Oh, he needs a little...

57
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:11,140
low.

58
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:13,920
Okay let me boost up he needs volume.

59
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:15,900
Boop.

60
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:18,560
He's great.

61
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:23,040
Like you can get up your mic for us.

62
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,180
Wait I think it's good.

63
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,000
Does I don't know?

64
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,160
Okay yeah yeah.

65
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,100
Wait I think you're good.

66
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:28,860
I think you're good.

67
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,060
Yeah yeah yeah.

68
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:31,320
Oh we're not count down.

69
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,440
We're not.

70
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,040
We're tree.

71
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,520
We're not tree?

72
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:36,880
The map said team six countdown.

73
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:38,520
But we're team six.

74
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:39,720
Wait who has countdown?

75
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:48,960
Wait team 2s countdown wait what wait dupe is a bastard guy
stole her poi i mean she's fine how the fuck did numbers

76
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:58,640
don't matter oh my gosh i mean true tree is tree is really
easy um i know i like it i like g honestly okay it's good

77
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:09,020
for the game are we doing rampart loba raids still yes i
think so okay we could we could drop rampart for damage i

78
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:13,420
was just gonna we were just doing for knock damage we could
just drop rampart for like watson or something because meds

79
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:23,360
might be a problem i mean i could do it it's perfect
whoever's playing that character uh i can do i can do any of

80
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:31,460
them watson caustic or rampart so it really depends on which
is the best one um i mean caustic's like hard meta right now

81
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:37,440
i'm calm but i don't know how competitive this is gonna be i
think if i mean It's going to be sweaty.

82
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:42,100
I feel like, I mean, not going to lie, but some teams are
very imbalanced.

83
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:45,220
Yeah, some of the teams are really imbalanced.

84
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:50,480
I played like, I streamed Apex once last week, so.

85
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:53,640
So these teams are pretty unbalanced.

86
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,820
We're playing the game on easy mode.

87
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:56,920
We're sitting center zone.

88
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:06,020
Mimi, I nominate you to do no attachments.

89
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:07,420
Okay.

90
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:08,560
I might be Tony.

91
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,240
You're supposed to fight back.

92
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,460
You're not just supposed to accept it.

93
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:14,500
I don't know, Doki.

94
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,640
That sounds bush.

95
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,900
I don't think you are.

96
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:20,240
I can't believe you would do this.

97
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:24,360
I've just met you, but you should do the known attachments.

98
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,320
Since you think you know everything.

99
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:27,620
Are you the IGL?

100
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,100
Senox, who should do it?

101
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:30,460
And you know what?

102
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,400
No, Senox, you pick.

103
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,640
You're the IGL.

104
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,520
Realistically, who's worse?

105
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:35,700
If we want to be real.

106
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:44,720
what's your if you want if you want me to choose that's what
i'm saying what's your unfortunately who is worse oh i am

107
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:51,580
not the idealist definitely one of y'all yes i just telling
us who is the worst player out of the two of us he mean

108
00:06:51,580 --> 00:07:00,620
what's your rank oh i'm that i'm like diamondish i don't
know higher ranked than me oh whoa not right now oh my gosh

109
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:09,860
currently today oh my gosh today what's your rank today nor
i'm like what's that my gold oh thank god i'm flat right now

110
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:21,220
okay you can do i would no shot i'm flat right now so you're
goaded so i the lowest ranked the lowest ranked members

111
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:30,360
should play the no attachments in p20 yeah there we go there
we go we figured it out what's your rank senox yeah what's

112
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:35,200
your rank senox i don't know i was i got massive when the
season came out or i got pregnant when the season came out

113
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:42,320
and i haven't pulled it since oh so you are a master so he's
master's yeah so he's still the highest rank highest rank

114
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:50,200
igl it's the rule it i sent you the thing it's it's pretty
easy it's shriek whoever's on beacon character you just loot

115
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:56,480
mid and hit beacon someone else looks like i'm someone else
okay the other side it doesn't my thing watson rampart or

116
00:07:56,480 --> 00:08:05,720
caustic igl it's up to me whichever one you want to play i
don't think it matters i mean rampart we could use it to get

117
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:12,040
more and more sniper knocks and like overall damage um
caustic would just be better for actually winning games yeah

118
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:21,100
but like we're not here to win games we're here to do
challenges um is does watson do anything for any of these an

119
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:25,780
arc star stick you could turn all your nades into arc stars
um

120
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:39,930
all right okay so i guess it's all rng on how many meds we
get honestly okay i'll just pick up rampart then if there's

121
00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:47,370
or i'll just pick up rampart then just for the damage
padding if we're doing i mean it'll be good for snipers if

122
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:56,570
we're doing damage padding yeah yeah use your alt three
times what how do i oh wait loba that'll be fast for loba

123
00:08:56,570 --> 00:09:06,370
love you yeah i feel like we should do the evo harvester
like instantly just travel travel to all the we can just hit

124
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:12,930
them on the we can hit them on the way yeah okay i guess it
all just depends where the zone is because if it's across

125
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:20,110
the map we could just play like you know what i mean we have
to use our evac towers our three evac towers yeah oh and we

126
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:31,560
have a loba to get those eva towers oh my god three evacs at
the same time we're thinking we were supposed to start our

127
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:35,580
game like nine minutes ago who is not

128
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:51,000
girl's not here girl the host isn't here in the lobby i

129
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:07,730
mean in my mic actually i think we play watson oh never mind
if a lot of the people are playing gibby kossick for the the

130
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:13,970
challenge we're like actually gonna get took by gibby
kossick out without watson jim yeah that is that is so smart

131
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:22,710
i nominate doki to play watson oh my god that's good because
i was gonna nominate myself anyway thank you yeah i can do

132
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:40,840
watson i used to play her she's so cute i love her where is
girl girl where are you you're the host all right i muted my

133
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,900
mic i'm so anxious

134
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,180
they're so serious

135
00:10:54,120 --> 00:11:01,680
bro they're like they're like metacrafting earlier before i
started the stream i was just like hey

136
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:18,920
the anxiety you know i found out that wasn't a thought okay
by participating we each get like 500 i thought we get 1 500

137
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:26,620
i was like fuck yeah i don't care how well we do we get a
thousand five hundred dollars each and then i realized i

138
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:35,000
can't read and it actually says every team gets a thousand
five hundred so i get five hundred dollars i get 500 for

139
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,860
participating and just being there which is great because
that means Because there's three tournaments.

140
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:46,480
So that means if I signed up for all three, technically I
can get 1,500.

141
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:51,640
It's still better than nothing.

142
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:52,360
Exactly.

143
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:56,020
It's still better than being a professional player.

144
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,240
Sorry, that's a bit.

145
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,580
That's a low blow.

146
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,920
That's a low blow.

147
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,660
It's still better.

148
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:09,060
I still earn more than a regular professional player.

149
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:15,700
professional player so So that's all that matters.

150
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,660
That's all that matters.

151
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,140
Oh my god.

152
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:26,200
Anyway, yeah, people are very I was like when I okay I
remember I saw the teams and I was like, oh shit, this is

153
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:36,640
like some of these teams are very very like Like really good
and then I was like maybe the mini games are like actual

154
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:44,140
mini games, you know, like no punch Or like like no weapons
punch out stuff like that and I was like wait you actually

155
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:54,020
have to play the game And I was just like I was like what do
you mean what why do some teams have two friends I'm not

00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:15,740
Thank you.

162
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:16,500

So, I'm just like, folk, they were like, let's try and win.

165
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:21,660
I was like, win.

166
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,120
Skyhooker Shadows, because of a winning tree.

167
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:26,300
Yay!

168
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,480
We're starting!

169
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:31,020
Alright, I got this.

170
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,720
I got Watson picked out.

171
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,140
Wait, where is she?

172
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:36,140
we

173
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:57,580
all just get a bunch of shield cells together we can make a
heart instantly how big does that heart need to be i don't

174
00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:03,800
think it has to be that big i think just needs to be a heart
i think just arguably a heart i think just one person can

175
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:10,700
just make the heart and then we're good to go i've never
made a ship that cell heart have you oh i can do it i can

176
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:13,620
good ship and beacon wait Wait, we got beacon?

177
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:14,660
Fuck yeah.

178
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,280
Wait, I land in the middle, right?

179
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:17,020
Yeah.

180
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,420
I can land on the front side.

181
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:19,120
All right.

182
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:19,720
Yep.

183
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,420
We're going to be doing the no loot challenge.

184
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,740
We just got to get the zone and lobo loot.

185
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:24,580
All right.

186
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:26,440
What's the no loot challenge?

187
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,580
We just don't get loot because we're landing tree.

188
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:30,300
That's fine.

189
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:31,060
We have lobo.

190
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:32,640
We can just pick the loot up.

191
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:36,340
Literally, I just pulled up the gold.

192
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:37,720
Oh, like the actual challenge.

193
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:38,860
And I was like, wait, what?

194
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:39,840
All right.

195
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,340
I don't remember how the loot.

196
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,200
Pat was, but I know I was in mid.

197
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,540
You just loot all the mid and then you can hit beacon
whenever.

198
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:47,160
Yay, okay.

199
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:50,420
Actually, you can land on the beacon and hit a... Can you
still hit double hit beacons?

200
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,240
I forgot about that.

201
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:51,800
Oh my god.

202
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:52,360
Okay, hang on.

203
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:53,420
FOV.

204
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:54,540
FOV.

205
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:55,440
Oh yeah, FOV 90.

206
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,080
No attachments.

207
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:57,420
Remember, zero attachments.

208
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:58,720
Okay.

209
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,860
Ooh, I gotta run double heavy.

210
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:04,600
It's actually not that bad.

211
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:06,680
No, it's just bad on stream.

212
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:08,920
It just looks terrible.

213
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:10,660
Oh.

214
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:24,400
no p20s on my side there is a zone out yet i have a blue bag
give me nades all right oh i have a blue bag too oh my god i

215
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:28,600
literally feel like i'm in a if you're doing sniper here is
i'm gonna scan

216
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:42,480
we can go we should wait we should go we should go skull
piercer i'll let this build on end up all right i only found

217
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:49,000
two stacks of shield cells that's really i didn't get to be
honest Do we get any EVACs?

218
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:49,680
We have one EVAC.

219
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:53,140
Let's try to hit this balloon and pray we don't die hitting
it.

220
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:55,220
I feel like, yeah, we shouldn't use any of our EVACs yet.

221
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:58,300
We won't have to just use one to get in the zone.

222
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:01,380
No, our EVACs.

223
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,060
I have my ult.

224
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:02,760
Should I drop it?

225
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:03,740
No, no, no, no.

226
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:04,820
I don't know.

227
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,760
I mean, just drop it now because you recharge it fast.

228
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:09,320
We just need to use it three times, right?

229
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:10,620
Yeah.

230
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:11,740
Yeah, just drop it now.

231
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:12,160
Do it.

232
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:12,580
Okay.

233
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:13,000
I'll go.

234
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,460
Yeah, and we'll just look at it for, like, one second.

235
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:27,260
I'm gonna loot and I'm gonna grab a shield cell oh beautiful

00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:54,960
Well, oh, I might be dead.

241
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,160
We can craft if we die.

242
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:58,860
Alright, we're fine, I'm fine, I'm fine.

243
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:00,740
Come inside, run, run, run, run deep to the tunnel.

244
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:01,420
Alright.

245
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:02,620
They're aping us, hard aping us.

246
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:03,060
Whoa!

247
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:03,820
This guy's on Revenant.

248
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:12,130
There you go.

249
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:13,330
Keep going, keep going, keep going, keep going, keep going.

250
00:17:13,410 --> 00:17:13,750
Left or right?

251
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:15,050
Oh, right, okay.

252
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:15,670
You might have to hold them here.

253
00:17:15,690 --> 00:17:16,650
Oh, they're literally here.

254
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:17,370
They're here.

255
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:18,170
Oh, yeah, I'm dead.

256
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:22,110
I didn't, I didn't know it was left or right.

257
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:23,070
I cracked off.

258
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:32,530
you're pushing hard pushing hard eating hard eating i'm not
gonna lie just run run run did not hear them climb up there

259
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:36,610
if you're gonna die if you're gonna die at least kill
yourself with names oh wait yeah i'm actually gonna kill

260
00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:46,110
myself with names if you're gonna die okay i mean we
technically did accomplish some of these challenges we just

261
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:53,670
bro this relative character is op did you i needed myself i
needed myself yeah we got that that's all you needed

262
00:17:57,110 --> 00:18:06,310
amazing it's okay we got like okay I don't think we won this
game so okay I had 90 FOV and I had I didn't get a knock

263
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:12,890
with the P20 I just had the P20 for no reason but I had no
attachments hey that's two challenges right two points for

264
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:20,110
me yeah yeah that's two points I should have like just ran
to the right should have walked back to you I was confused

265
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:26,010
too I didn't know if we were going left or right I was just
like I'm like I heard the revenant alt and the jump and we

266
00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:26,850
were just dead.

267
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:28,290
No, we split up.

268
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:29,490
One of us could have lived.

269
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:35,270
I just didn't know which way to go.

270
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:38,010
It's okay.

271
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:41,830
We got three challenges, even though I don't think those
three challenges...

272
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:42,650
We were not last.

273
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:43,870
We got 19th place.

274
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:45,910
Why did somebody die before us?

275
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:46,770
Yeah, I don't know.

276
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:47,970
I guess fucking losers.

277
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:49,570
And then they die before us.

278
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:51,970
Imagine dying first.

279
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:53,010
I know, right?

280
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:53,910
No, I mean.

281
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:56,850
We didn't die first.

282
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:01,850
Imagine dying first.

283
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:04,610
Wait, was there no...

284
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:05,470
What do you mean, guys?

285
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:07,050
That was totally sound.

286
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:12,310
Okay, let me just harass Tempo into...

287
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:13,910
Into posting game 2.

288
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:16,290
Putting in the game 2 list.

289
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:21,670
Oh yeah, after the game ends, have one player...

290
00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:23,790
I mean, we could technically post our stuff now.

291
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:35,630
yeah we could please be accurate we will be going over the
VODs thanks oh they can't go after my VODs I have no replay

292
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:45,610
um I don't have permissions yet so maybe they open it up at
the end of the game oh I mean that makes sense for a tempo

293
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:56,080
you can't look at my VOD he has to wait until my streams
that over yeah turn down senox

294
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:05,500
actually was just i just i just coin flipped the game on
them right setting but they didn't have a beacon character

295
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:20,800
i'm just glad that i don't have to play 90 fov well what if
they have 90 fov again in the in the card doubt it they

296
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:26,820
might though they might it's okay i really do feel like I
don't know, they might get harder or they might like change

297
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:28,920
the guns that you have to get knocks with.

298
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:31,220
I'm pretty sure they'll change like comps and stuff too.

299
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:34,520
Yeah, I think the comp one will change every game and then
the guns will change.

300
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:35,240
Uh-huh.

301
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,560
I'm pretty sure.

302
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:39,980
It's okay, this was just warm up.

303
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:42,160
This was warm up here.

304
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,560
And sort of, we sort of landed on them to be fair.

305
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:48,060
Oh yeah, I know.

306
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:53,120
I was actually just assuming they'd be gone because they're
landing next to Enzone but they just weren't playing a

307
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:53,520
beacon character.

308
00:20:56,610 --> 00:21:05,670
that was that was pretty that was pretty unlucky it's okay
if this team wins then we technically we won one again yeah

309
00:21:05,670 --> 00:21:14,470
technically we won the game because we got killed by the the
winners so we would have liver guide lists i'm

310
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:28,670
gonna message tempo be like let me see game two let me see
the game two list so we can metacraft

311
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:33,370
and see

312
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:39,560
tempo show me game two

313
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:44,620
not that

314
00:21:49,220 --> 00:22:00,360
oh doki i think i have some people from your community
following me on twitter oh oh that's nice wait tempo's

315
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:06,700
making the card in between games he's done he doesn't even
No, it's in game two!

316
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,540
Okay, we should give him ideas.

317
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:10,600
We should give him ideas.

318
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:13,000
He literally was like, I don't even know.

319
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:15,280
I'm literally making the card right now.

320
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:19,060
One of the challenges could be have a fat ass.

321
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,440
So, check.

322
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:22,080
I got y'all covered.

323
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:23,800
Which that means just play Loba.

324
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:26,320
Just play Loba.

325
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:29,740
Okay, chat, we can influence tempo.

326
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,580
He'll do what I'll say.

327
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,140
Like, in Beases.

00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:32,000
On the side.

334
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,860
Look, the drop is a serious person.

335
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:36,720
I'm not gonna lie.

336
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:40,400
Yeah, that's thinking it's safe.

337
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,540
Oh my god.

338
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:50,020
He has a second computer monitor on the side.

339
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,460
Like a second computer.

340
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:56,900
I'm sorry, Temple, if you're watching this and you didn't
want me to leak that.

341
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:01,240
Oh, he can let me, he said I can show it.

342
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:02,840
Guys, look at his fucking setup.

343
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:04,000
It's actually crazy.

344
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:06,960
Oh, my God.

345
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:10,960
That's like, that's like sensor overload for me.

346
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,420
Jesus Christ.

347
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:14,440
Look at this, guys.

348
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:15,980
Oh, it's...

349
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:16,380
Oh.

350
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:18,300
Look at this.

351
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:19,560
Seven fucking monitors.

352
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:20,820
XQC was right.

353
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:24,580
How do you...

354
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:30,660
That is like, like, three monitors is already too much for
me.

355
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:38,000
Seven mon- two mouse, two keyboards.

356
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:47,640
Actually, three mouse, four keyboards, seven monitors, one
PC, a camera, a mic.

357
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,280
My God.

358
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:57,580
He had to, like, check.

359
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:01,480
to make sure there was nothing confidential.

360
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:08,860
My god, he needs to go further beyond.

361
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:12,480
Five cats.

362
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:14,660
Six consoles.

363
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,620
Oh my god.

364
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:24,460
This is this is like he organized this tournament, by the
way, guys.

365
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:28,060
Like, you need to have at least seven monitors to be able to
organize this tournament.

366
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,580
That's actually crazy.

367
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,040
That's a lot of PC.

368
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:38,520
Zero wall.

369
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:39,560
It's okay, guys.

370
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:42,240
I can, like, peer pressure him to buy Doki merch.

371
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:44,220
And then he can put...

372
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:50,220
He's thinking with a super chat.

373
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:50,640
Thank you, Jake.

374
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:51,860
By the way, I muted myself.

375
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:55,880
I feel like I don't want to, like, bother with the shit I
say.

376
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:07,540
i can peer pressure him to buy doki merch and put that way
let me message that if if i send okay if you you should buy

377
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:10,830
my merch to decorate your wall

378
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:21,460
it's so it's so empty

379
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:29,140
True.

380
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,520
And then it's like, it's like free.

381
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:35,720
Okay, it's not free advertising because like he has to pay
for my merch.

382
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:39,900
But it's like, it's, oh, it is free advertising for me.

383
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,320
Because he's the one that spent money.

384
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:45,880
So it's technically free advertising for me.

385
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:49,300
Okay, I should like let you guys actually watch the game.

386
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:54,500
Not look at, not look at Tempo's fucking setup.

387
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:01,280
modders in zero doking merch.

388
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:04,120
It's a free win-win.

389
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:06,560
Exactly.

390
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:12,220
So anytime, anytime someone comes in, he's like TSM's
manager.

391
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:17,400
So like, I might be able to get TSM fans to buy my merch.

392
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,820
Guys, I don't know if you guys know this, but I'm playing
the game.

393
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:25,160
This is me right now.

394
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,280
This is me right now.

395
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:30,000
No, don't die.

396
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,000
You have to win.

397
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:33,240
So it technically means we died to the champion.

398
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,860
You guys can't die.

399
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:40,540
You guys, as in me, I can't die.

400
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:42,440
God, I'm so good at this game.

401
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:44,040
Holy shit.

402
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,300
Seven kills already.

403
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,060
Number one revved me.

404
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:53,400
You can call me number one pred.

405
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:54,540
No!

406
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:55,080
Drop!

407
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:56,160
I mean, Doki!

408
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:57,680
Don't die!

409
00:27:58,460 --> 00:27:59,460
I have to live!

410
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:00,080
No!

411
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,320
I died!

412
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:06,180
It's okay.

413
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:07,700
It's just...

414
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:08,520
That was...

415
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:11,160
Guys, just so you guys know, that was not me.

416
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:13,020
I would never play like that.

417
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,080
Play it.

418
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:19,880
It's okay.

419
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:21,800
This is actually me.

420
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:24,920
It was a little spectator bug that happened.

421
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:26,680
So I am...

422
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:28,440
Wait, who is on my team?

423
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:45,000
who is on my team okay that is i'm dz i'm i dz zero it's
like dokey dokey's bird zero dokey's zero bird wait what is

425
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:01,520
Doki's zero bird.

426
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:03,360
There we go.

427
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:04,980
I always knew.

428
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:05,700
I know!

429
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:08,400
The thing is, Doki is universal.

430
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,220
I can be from any country.

431
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:13,020
So, like, today I'm in Australia.

432
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,080
Today I'm on Australia.

433
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:22,680
It'll be funny if we actually did influence Tempo's Game 2
bingo.

434
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:23,720
Or not bingo.

435
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:24,700
What is it called?

436
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:26,980
Like, challenge sheet.

437
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:31,120
This feels like you've made this.

438
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,620
I made this.

439
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,680
You're you're zero.

440
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:35,880
I'm zero

441
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:40,940
Australian dokey.

442
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:46,320
I mean I'm technically like I'm like halfway there
Australians swear a lot.

443
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,580
I swear a lot.

444
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,860
They say I don't say that

445
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:58,440
That is sadly not in my is it sad?

446
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:02,000
Sadly, that is not in my natural vocabulary.

447
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:04,660
You hesitated.

448
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,660
Oh, what was I gonna say?

449
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,420
You'll never know.

450
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,500
You'll never... They say what?

451
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:11,420
I don't know.

452
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:17,800
What would they be saying?

453
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:19,420
Do we keep our POI?

454
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,160
Oh, no, it changes.

455
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:22,600
Wait, it changes?

456
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:26,580
Oh, I mean, I'm...

457
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:28,280
I don't want... I didn't like tree anyway.

458
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:31,280
I didn't like tree anyway.

459
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,920
Drop the bomb, mate.

460
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:39,440
You can't say I have the pass!

461
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:42,500
I'm only half Australian!

462
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:50,540
You can say can't.

463
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:52,220
Yeah.

464
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:57,220
I can't say that way.

465
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:03,360
What?

466
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:04,620
I can't do that!

467
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,160
What do you mean?

468
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:12,000
I can't understand what you're talking about.

469
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:26,120
Oh my god.

470
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:28,500
Yeah, half a pass.

471
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:29,520
Half the word.

472
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:32,060
Oh my god, who's gonna win?

473
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,720
I like how nobody's doing me.

474
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,000
The Valk- the Valk- we should have done the Valkyrie thing.

475
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:41,780
We could have got one more.

476
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:44,620
Whoa!

477
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,500
I died.

478
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:48,400
Doki Zero Bird!

479
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:49,540
How could you?

480
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,080
You're supposed to be the champion!

481
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:54,900
How could you do this?

482
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,360
All right, who's in this team?

483
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:58,680
Oh my god.

484
00:31:58,920 --> 00:31:59,200
Okay, wait.

485
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:01,800
Who's- okay.

486
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:03,340
Wait, wait a minute.

487
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,160
Is that Sykes?

488
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:05,980
Okay, they're on the same team.

489
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,580
is technically the same thing.

490
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:12,700
It's now Doki's Sykes Bird.

491
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:13,980
They're on the same team.

492
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:15,460
It's the same thing.

493
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,540
I'm on the same team.

494
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:20,060
It's the same thing.

495
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:26,320
13 kills.

496
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:28,120
Because he's a pro player.

497
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:30,060
He's a controller player.

498
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:33,980
The only thing we were missing was a controller player.

499
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:34,620
Okay.

500
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:46,940
do we're all in m and wait a sunox controller or mmk let me
look at the input real fast i just don't remember okay

501
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:59,980

502
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:04,880
k players what were we supposed to do what were we supposed
to do

503
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,020
We were all M&K.

504
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:13,200
Movement can't save us.

505
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:15,700
Oh, why is that?

506
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:18,540
Oh, that's like the Pathfinder thingy, right?

507
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,220
Oh my god, where are they?

508
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:23,620
That poor Gibraltar is just floating in this...

509
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:26,780
That poor Cossack that was in the middle of nowhere.

510
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:28,200
What the fuck?

511
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:33,780
Yeah, I'm the content creator!

512
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:35,980
What do you mean?

513
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:39,160
has three people.

514
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:45,740
An Apex streamer, a pro player, and the content creator.

515
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,160
I am the content creator.

516
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:51,540
You cannot put all the expectations on me.

517
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:54,560
We should be putting all the expectations on the pro player.

518
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:03,760
If we are blaming anybody, it's definitely not me.

519
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:22,480
Look, I am the content creator I want to tempo finish this
fucking bingo card No, I'm gonna blame you I'm not two

520
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:32,660

521
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:44,520

00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:54,380

three well i don't think we got a lot we died instantly we

523
00:34:54,380 --> 00:35:02,820

525
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:07,440
Okay, yeah, it's a three.

526
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:07,760
Total.

527
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:08,980
Okay, three.

528
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:09,920
It's okay.

529
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,820
Other people did three as well.

530
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,680
Or not last in the challenges either.

531
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:16,840
Who the fuck did A?

532
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:18,060
That's insane.

533
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:24,640
Oh my god.

534
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:25,720
Zero got zero.

535
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:27,360
Damn.

536
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:28,500
Wait, they got zero.

537
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:29,640
At least we didn't get zero.

538
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,600
We're not zero.

539
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:35,040
They might be the team that died last, too.

540
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:36,280
Or died first.

541
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:40,540
If they got zero, that's That is actually unfortunate.

542
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:44,040
Guys, I just need you guys to know, chat.

543
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:45,520
Three is the average.

544
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:51,260
There's like six other people with three.

545
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,300
We're not alone.

546
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:57,800
Guys, we got the average.

547
00:35:58,220 --> 00:35:59,160
We got it.

548
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:02,060
I have to, like, really think about them.

549
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:04,220
And honestly, like...

550
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:10,940
If we would have maybe played slow, where we maybe would
have had more time, finish some of these like little easy

551
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:17,960
ones i don't know yeah we could have got their little heart
our little heart and then we could yeah like even before we

552
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:23,700
left the poi like we could have did the fucking we could
just not we could just not play hard zone then because if

553
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:28,000
we're playing hard so we have to go center zone but if we
die early we just get zero done let's just yeah let's just

554
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:34,040
do all the easy stuff in our in our poi and then move on i'm
done

555
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:41,480
Yeah, I hope he actually changes the challenges.

556
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:42,460
Oh, no, he is.

557
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:45,160
He's like doing them in between games.

558
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:50,060
All right, we just do all the ones we can do instantly
without having to do any work, and then we just get the

559
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:50,540
other ones out.

560
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:52,540
And we just, if we do get in the game, do the other ones?

561
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:52,980
I'm done.

562
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,160
Yeah, yeah, just get the easy ones out.

563
00:36:56,320 --> 00:37:04,620
All right, we just have like some of the challenges done
then zero, like that poor man over there.

564
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:06,940
Chat, do not worry.

565
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:09,100
I will not call out the person that got zero.

566
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:12,860
you might be able to find out on girl's stream yourself

567
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:30,980
if you really want to know you won't find out on my stream I
am muted I hate I am muted thank you for the 50 gifted chips

568
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:41,920
bacon thank you thank you what I'm not gonna call anybody
else wait so is it whoever completes the most challenges

569
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:49,500
over all six games or is it just whoever completes it for
that game for that game okay but the one the team that

570
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:58,300
completes the most challenges overall goes to the finals you
get the money to go to the finals two teams two teams that

571
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:07,340
completes the most challenges overall uh gets to uh go to
the finals uh but like you get to win a thousand five

572
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:17,460
hundred for the most challenges completed per game 500 for
winning first place or a thousand 500 for completing the

573
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:27,050
most challenges okay i'm looking at right now six teams make
finals off of challenges one per game and then two

574
00:38:27,050 --> 00:38:29,590
individual players with most kills

575
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:43,940
yeah yeah yeah yeah so it's either but so like finals is
just dependent on challenges oh yeah we actually just need

576
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:48,940
to spam challenges with one game and just get infinite we
just do the bare minimum ones we can do and then if we have

577
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:50,360
a good game we crank out like 10.

578
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:58,260
yeah exactly do we do the same comp or do we should we play
the comp guy no i want to see what the challenges are i want

579
00:38:58,260 --> 00:39:03,900
to see what he changes because if we're not playing if we're
not if we're not rotating then we shouldn't put that comp

580
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:11,820
what finals okay here i'll tell you guys uh that has a
challenge for playing the actual comp because it's just a

581
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:21,700
free challenge basically yeah basically um it is basically
like whichever There's four tournaments, but I can't count.

582
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:25,340
So there's three tournaments that are like the qualifying
tournaments.

583
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:26,840
I should sign up for next week too.

584
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:29,660
I didn't sign up for next week, but if I'd be like, Temple,
can I join next week?

585
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:31,120
Maybe he'll be like, okay.

586
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:36,240
Anyway, anyway.

587
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:37,800
At least sign up for like two.

588
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,280
But you can sign up for three.

589
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:41,920
Anyway, so there's three tournaments.

590
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:46,380
And they're each like invitational.

591
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:49,260
And so basically...

592
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:58,300
the team that wins the most challenges in each tournament
goes towards the finals.

593
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:04,720
And the finals, so like, the finals would be composed of all
the teams that are, like, the best of each individual

594
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:05,160
tournament.

595
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:06,820
Each individual tournament is different.

596
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:12,060
The second one, the reason why I didn't sign up for the
second one was because the second one was actually more

597
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:14,300
reliant on, like, FPS skills.

598
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:18,100
But I didn't realize this tournament, I thought the
mini-games, when they mean mini-games, it's, like,

599
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:19,480
hide-and-seek and stuff like that.

600
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:25,860
you're not actually like playing everyone's asking for the
challenge trying hard and stuff like that but now i realize

601
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:34,220
oh this is actually low-key try hard so i might as well sign
up for the second one as well maybe ahead of time sorry i

602
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:41,920
had to listen to what they're saying anyway i didn't realize
okay so now now i'm like oh i might as well sign up for the

603
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:47,960
second one because the first one is basically like the
second one and i already got that out of the way So I might

604
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:54,400
as well sign up for the second one also Because the second
one is also like Like shooting your gun So

605
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:05,660
I thought You know I thought they'd be like punching boxing
Stuff like that Because it says mini games But I didn't

606
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:08,580
realize What they meant was a bingo chart

607
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:23,960
Anyway Anyway as I was saying um so it's basically whichever
team completes the most challenges and also whichever two

608
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:29,680
individuals do the most kills they get straight to the
finals and then the finals is composed of all the teams that

609
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:38,140
did really well in the invitation is and then boom a
thousand five easy 500 dollars that i make it to the finals

610
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:52,980
yeah there is a lot of um really two teams got 10 challenges
completed and they tied for first oh my gosh by the way like

611
00:41:52,980 --> 00:42:00,980
it's actually oh yeah i'm gonna say who placed like it's
actually crazy though i'd be surprised if like i get into

612
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:08,340
the second the other two tournaments because apparently a
lot of people signed up for these like a lot of people

613
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:15,960
obviously i can't give up the numbers but like um they when
i they're like I had they're like they're like I have to

gonna it has to be actually funny guys so like challenges

674
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:11,580
we're gonna keep going to do keep the same card for world's
edge and then a new card for storm point so the challenges

675
00:47:11,580 --> 00:47:19,060
are the same oh the challenges are the same does he mean
like the ones we've completed are like we don't have to

676
00:47:19,060 --> 00:47:23,500
complete like we're keeping the same ones are we genuinely
just on the same card i think that's what everyone i think

677
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:31,900
like yeah i think everyone's asking that right now i think
uh i really meant like i guess like the challenges are the

678
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:42,020
same but they reset maybe someone is asking if they carry
over because if they do carry it would make sense to carry

679
00:47:42,020 --> 00:47:54,020
over because like why have to play 90 fov every fucking game
please no please i feel like i feel like it shouldn't though

680
00:47:54,020 --> 00:48:01,620
like to be to make it fair for everybody because like each
uh like you win a thousand five hundred for having the most

681
00:48:01,620 --> 00:48:07,120
challenges and like the person the team with the most
challenges are ready from the first game we'll have yeah

682
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:14,300
they should reset yeah you're right It should because like
they would it would be so easy for them to finish a lot of

683
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:17,380
their challenges I don't even think he's answered anybody at
all.

684
00:48:17,820 --> 00:48:23,780
I think he's thinking he's like wait this is a bad idea
Because he was making the card.

685
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:25,960
I was talking to him.

686
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:34,280
He was trying to make the card not prepared I think like
halfway like he he didn't think the game was gonna end that

687
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:36,140
fast while he was making the card

688
00:48:44,910 --> 00:48:46,510
Thank you for the 50 gift and chips.

689
00:48:46,630 --> 00:48:47,950
Thank you, thank you.

690
00:48:48,290 --> 00:48:49,630

Thank you so much.

692
00:48:50,890 --> 00:48:53,050
Also, yes, we don't have, like, emotes yet.

693
00:48:53,250 --> 00:49:00,710
Because, like, I was, like, thinking, like, I felt like I
wanted to wait until my new skin suit was finished before we

694
00:49:00,710 --> 00:49:04,130
have, before we upload new emotes.

695
00:49:04,490 --> 00:49:08,090
I meant down to upload emotes of my dog.

696
00:49:10,050 --> 00:49:14,890
Because I don't want to, like, I don't want to, like, waste
money and, like, have it remixed.

697
00:49:19,310 --> 00:49:24,570
okay but yes oh we just do we just play valkyrie caustic

the update because like they're still trying to figure out

705
00:50:34,690 --> 00:50:41,870
the whole fucking team scenario at the moment but basically
um basically

706
00:50:45,910 --> 00:50:55,590
tomorrow it's not going to be Resident Evil 4 we're swapping
Resident Evil 4 with the who phobia who phobia stream do the

707
00:50:55,590 --> 00:51:06,410
scheduling is because like the people I got Sayu and Amali
got fruit so um uh the schedule works better on Friday

708
00:51:06,410 --> 00:51:13,270
instead of Saturday so on Friday we're playing with Amali
Sayu and fruit and then Saturday it's going to be Resident

709
00:51:13,270 --> 00:51:24,150
Evil 4 uh it's only We swapped it because, like, there was,
like, it was the best scheduling-wise, uh, for, uh, no,

710
00:51:24,270 --> 00:51:30,890
S-I-U, C-C-Y-Y-Y, wait, C-Y-Y-Y-U, the voice actor.

711
00:51:37,270 --> 00:51:37,750
Okay.

712
00:51:39,630 --> 00:51:41,550
Here, here, I'll type it down.

713
00:51:46,950 --> 00:51:51,150
I know it got confusing It got confusing

714
00:51:55,270 --> 00:52:11,330
Maybe it is a sigh Okay So So yeah I got sigh On my end and
Amon Lee got fruit So to match everybody's schedule Because

715
00:52:11,330 --> 00:52:21,210
there was like four of us You know Saturday people uh people
would have like Saturday the schedule was conflicting for a

716
00:52:21,210 --> 00:52:30,390
lot of us so uh we decided to swap it for tomorrow instead
of uh instead of Saturday so I just wanted to give you guys

717
00:52:30,390 --> 00:52:46,790
the update for that everybody's just debating guys okay okay
so people there is a huge technical issue at the moment

718
00:52:46,790 --> 00:53:00,790
because people are are debating right now about like whether
or not to reset the cards and everything uh oh wait okay um

719
00:53:00,790 --> 00:53:11,230
all right so oh wait okay i'm looking at the update i'm
looking at the update right now we have to make a change to

720
00:53:11,230 --> 00:53:16,950
a few challenges we're completed i was on wait what wait i
don't even wait i wasn't supposed to read that out

721
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:31,980
sorry i didn't answer it whoops sorry they're talking about
it right now they're still deciding they're still i'm sorry

722
00:53:31,980 --> 00:53:41,080
i didn't mean i didn't leak anything i didn't leak anything
guys i didn't leak anything they're having a discussion

723
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:51,080
about whether or not the challenges stack or they are or
they would keep going so one of the biggest issue right now

724
00:53:51,080 --> 00:53:59,840
is that there was 25 challenges but they didn't they thought
that we were gonna get 25 challenges or like close to 25

725
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:13,240
challenges and uh but we sort of uh the closest was 10
challenges so they're trying to decide right now if like

726
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:23,220
we're gonna keep the same card and seeing um and like just
whoever gets the most type deal because like no the closest

727
00:54:23,220 --> 00:54:29,260
the team got was 10 challenges and not 25 because like 25
was a lot

728
00:54:32,940 --> 00:54:47,040
okay let me let me see if anybody got me some dokey clips
that i can like spam of clips chat chat we have so many wait

729
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:53,980
no no we should not because i would divide the vote guys
don't divide the vote guys give me your best clips

730
00:54:57,300 --> 00:55:08,140
i realize if we spend too many clips then it'll divide the
votes too fast so we have to send give me your best clips to

731
00:55:08,140 --> 00:55:19,440
like we cannot divide the votes guys if if we we have to win
this together what close clips from this stream i know

732
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:22,860
there's no there's there's no rewind but i believe in you

733
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:36,980
i i believe in you guys clip master i need your strongest
clips right now because but guys Guys, but think of it this

734
00:55:36,980 --> 00:55:37,300
way.

735
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:45,160
If we can technically win, because they're thinking, they're
like, oh, we might send it to like 500 per clip.

736
00:55:45,540 --> 00:55:48,500
If we win all four of them, we can...

737
00:55:50,220 --> 00:55:55,720
If we have all the four of the best clips, guys.

738
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:03,240
We can...

739
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:04,720
Guys, just think of this way.

740
00:56:05,780 --> 00:56:16,380
best clips yeah we can win all of them you can't handle guys
i believe in you i believe in all of

741
00:56:19,420 --> 00:56:28,820
you someone's like i feel so stupid right now trying to
understand all of this i'm just vibing i'm just vibing it's

742
00:56:28,820 --> 00:56:30,640
been one hour we played one game

743
00:56:35,780 --> 00:56:44,640
thinking of like dividing it by four so like instead of a
thousand each person um it's 500 per person so like if we

744
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:54,960
just have too many good clips we can technically get all of
them like we can how many games is six

745
00:56:59,860 --> 00:57:06,880
it's it's it's six guys Don't worry.

746
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:09,360
We can be here for six hours.

747
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:11,760
We can do this.

748
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:13,480
I believe in us.

749
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:15,380
I believe in us.

750
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:16,500
Okay.

751
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:22,220
Do not reuse the ones.

752
00:57:22,540 --> 00:57:22,780
What?

753
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:23,840
Do not redo.

754
00:57:23,980 --> 00:57:24,360
Oh.

755
00:57:25,100 --> 00:57:25,660
Oh.

756
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:27,480
Oh.

757
00:57:27,560 --> 00:57:27,900
Okay.

758
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:28,680
It stacks.

759
00:57:29,260 --> 00:57:30,100
It's gonna stack.

760
00:57:31,100 --> 00:57:32,360
It looks like it stacks.

761
00:57:33,420 --> 00:57:34,640
Because it says do not reuse.

762
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:35,760
Do the ones you've already.

763
00:57:35,780 --> 00:57:43,760
completed focus on completing the whole card seriously yeah
someone just said in chat i think they were watching on

764
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:50,180
stream so so it doesn't that's that's a bit unfair not gonna
lie

765
00:57:54,340 --> 00:58:01,640
obviously all right same card for our world's edge oh we
wipe okay we wipe okay what the fuck why why is it different

766
00:58:01,640 --> 00:58:07,660
from the person above okay so it's just fresh card it's the
same card but it wipes every game so we just do as many as

767
00:58:07,660 --> 00:58:17,160
we can we wipe oh my gosh okay i like how the person again i
like how someone there was like so we start all over after

768
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:25,620
they were like do not redo the ones you're hitting completed
oh thank god okay so we want to do as many as we can for

769
00:58:25,620 --> 00:58:38,360
free of it 90 fov three evo harvesters uh nades in a bag
three evacs or survival items I think we should knock

770
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:44,160
yourself draw heart no attachments alt three times that's
about it the other ones are at y'all I feel like we could

771
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:51,380
just do all that yeah we just we literally just lurk and do
nothing and wait okay we'll say Val you probably have to do

772
00:58:51,380 --> 00:58:58,180
the nade one because we some big boys yeah I just do it the
nade one we can do that right off the bat and then like we

773
00:58:58,180 --> 00:59:04,840
can have all we'll try and find as many alt excels as
possible and give it all to one person yeah that sounds

774
00:59:05,420 --> 00:59:10,580
legit just all run a different sniper and whoever gets a
knock finishes the challenge.

775
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:13,480
Wait, who's doing the no survival items?

776
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:14,440
Let's survive the game.

777
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:19,620
Okay, I feel like- I guess it depends if we get- if we have
three evacs, we can do the three evacs.

778
00:59:19,780 --> 00:59:21,520
If we don't, we can just do the don't use any.

779
00:59:21,900 --> 00:59:23,120
I guess it just means something we get.

780
00:59:23,140 --> 00:59:24,680
Wait, is the evac a survival item?

781
00:59:24,860 --> 00:59:25,960
I thought that was like fields.

782
00:59:27,160 --> 00:59:31,140
No, it's just- Chaos shields, mobi, and yeah, that's a
survival slot.

783
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:32,780
That's not health, is it?

784
00:59:33,100 --> 00:59:33,100
No.

785
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:38,860
Wait, is it survival- wouldn't that just be a white heal
like why would they call it a survival item because it helps

786
00:59:38,860 --> 00:59:46,160
you heal that's what i'm saying like what's a survival item
is survival item the heals or survival it's just the

787
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:52,360
survival because that's what they're called like yeah the
keybind is like mobile oh okay it's called survival item

788
00:59:52,360 --> 01:00:05,480
okay okay so we just don't use we just don't care about that
one yeah um but unfortunately we have to choose if we want

789
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:12,080
to get that point or get the point of using three evac
towers at the same time i feel like whichever one comes

790
01:00:12,080 --> 01:00:18,720
whichever one yeah we die before then then we technically we
you know just don't use any until we get through yeah okay

791
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:28,980
oh shit my dog is still on my stream um so we still we're
still on the tree right no we're countdown we're kind of oh

792
01:00:28,980 --> 01:00:35,000
we're countdown now yeah okay i'm on We could go for the we
could go for the maybe where's Gibby.

793
01:00:35,340 --> 01:00:36,600
Oh, you're not okay.

794
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:39,240
I guess we're not doing that then Okay, I'm okay.

795
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:42,680
We're I'm staying low, but then That is actually awful.

796
01:00:42,820 --> 01:00:43,680
I didn't even know the game was started.

797
01:00:43,860 --> 01:00:47,340
I was looking at the fucking Wait, can we get a restart?

798
01:00:47,740 --> 01:00:48,380
No, no, you're good.

799
01:00:48,560 --> 01:00:49,200
Can we get a restart?

800
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:50,280
Let's get a restart.

801
01:00:50,520 --> 01:00:51,280
We see you crashed

802
01:00:54,740 --> 01:00:56,700

806
01:01:07,300 --> 01:01:07,960
I hate it here.

807
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:11,620
I'm already trying to do it in scrims.

808
01:01:11,720 --> 01:01:13,600
Turn off your stream right now.

809
01:01:19,180 --> 01:01:19,560
Okay.

810
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:24,060

far.

811
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:24,660
Whoa.

812
01:01:26,620 --> 01:01:27,040
Oh,

813
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:34,430
I mean, we don't have a beacon.

814
01:01:34,590 --> 01:01:36,610
We just loot the POI and stack up.

815
01:01:36,610 --> 01:01:42,450
all alt excels you can all three times still yeah i mean we
i mean we just didn't do the loba all because like loba all

816
01:01:42,450 --> 01:01:48,610
is so fast yeah i can hit the button in the middle for you
guys yeah i'm just going to run over here and start loading

817
01:01:48,610 --> 01:01:50,470
through yeah you can load all this i'll do this stuff

818
01:01:56,930 --> 01:02:06,150
oh remember no attachments he me how could i forget that is
here's a try in theory you could technically do that one i

819
01:02:06,150 --> 01:02:10,590
could just do the no attachments and then pick up the care
package no attachments.

820
01:02:11,270 --> 01:02:11,330
Okay.

821
01:02:12,150 --> 01:02:14,290
I'll just run sniper and pick up a carefactor Jones.

822
01:02:14,770 --> 01:02:15,670
I've got a P20.

823
01:02:15,870 --> 01:02:18,710
But that means no scopes, though, because it's not an
attachment.

824
01:02:19,490 --> 01:02:19,990
It's alright.

825
01:02:20,690 --> 01:02:22,390
Yeah, no scopes either, but.

826
01:02:26,540 --> 01:02:26,980
Okay.

827
01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:29,220
I'm trying to find more shield cells.

828
01:02:30,120 --> 01:02:31,960
Well, it is pulling hard south.

829
01:02:33,360 --> 01:02:33,780
Unfortunately.

830
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:35,280
Wait, can you give me your shield cells healing?

831
01:02:35,360 --> 01:02:36,760
I can literally do the heart right now.

832
01:02:38,260 --> 01:02:38,620
Okay.

833
01:02:39,260 --> 01:02:39,680
Alright.

834
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:42,120
Wait.

835
01:02:42,220 --> 01:02:43,960
This is actually harder than I expected.

836
01:02:47,620 --> 01:02:47,940
Okay.

837
01:02:48,200 --> 01:02:49,420
Oh, I forgot to draw my shield.

838
01:02:51,240 --> 01:02:51,780
Oh, do I.

839
01:02:53,640 --> 01:02:54,700
That was the wrong mid.

840
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:55,600
Oh, no.

841
01:02:56,420 --> 01:02:56,740
Wait.

842
01:02:56,860 --> 01:02:57,880
Oh, what do I have to be?

843
01:02:58,240 --> 01:02:59,060
A fragrant mid.

844
01:02:59,520 --> 01:02:59,780
Here, here.

845
01:02:59,940 --> 01:03:00,700
Jesus Christ.

846
01:03:00,900 --> 01:03:01,720
Wait, I can do this.

847
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:03,180
No, I think I'll die if I do that.

848
01:03:04,380 --> 01:03:04,860
No, you're good.

849
01:03:04,940 --> 01:03:05,080
You're good.

850
01:03:05,180 --> 01:03:06,060
It'll knock you no matter what.

851
01:03:06,140 --> 01:03:06,560
You won't fall down.

852
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:07,040
You won't fall down.

853
01:03:07,220 --> 01:03:07,600
You're right.

854
01:03:08,020 --> 01:03:08,580
Oh, we got to go.

855
01:03:08,740 --> 01:03:09,260
No, aren't you?

856
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:09,960
Fragrant in.

857
01:03:10,160 --> 01:03:10,340
Fragrant in.

858
01:03:12,220 --> 01:03:14,380
the skyhook team pulls up and kills us.

859
01:03:14,380 --> 01:03:17,460
Oh my god wait this heart is harder than I expected.

860
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:18,700

Take this.

865
01:03:26,340 --> 01:03:27,760
It's almost a heart.

866
01:03:28,660 --> 01:03:30,780
Do it quick and then we gotta dip because we're about to
just die.

867
01:03:30,820 --> 01:03:31,520
Okay wait wait.

870
01:03:35,160 --> 01:03:36,380
If you look at it correct.

871
01:03:37,340 --> 01:03:37,640
Oh okay.

That's a heart.

875
01:03:43,180 --> 01:03:47,880
Let's grab the support bin and then go for the beacon
fishery and that's a heart.

876
01:03:48,100 --> 01:03:48,780
Did you take a screenshot?

877
01:03:50,020 --> 01:03:50,900
We can just take it from the VOD.

878
01:03:51,020 --> 01:03:51,580
We can take it from the VOD.

879
01:03:52,340 --> 01:03:53,580
We are shambles.

880
01:03:53,780 --> 01:03:55,100
We're no beacon too.

881
01:03:55,640 --> 01:03:56,260

Let's hit the support bin.

884
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:00,700
There's no armor on the ground.

885
01:04:00,780 --> 01:04:01,300
Let's just go for it.

886
01:04:01,300 --> 01:04:03,100
We're just going to go for eva harvesters and stuff.

887
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:03,560

And then I'll have port.

1003
01:09:52,010 --> 01:09:53,490
We got to try to port in the zone and survive.

1004
01:09:55,770 --> 01:09:57,390
I guess we don't use any survival items.

1005
01:09:57,530 --> 01:09:57,990
We don't have an either.

1006

This team might try to gatekeep us, so I'm gonna go ahead.

1028
01:10:59,050 --> 01:10:59,370
Whoop.

1029
01:11:00,650 --> 01:11:03,210

I didn't know if the P20 had to be naked.

1033
01:11:08,630 --> 01:11:09,610
Careful, there was people on the right.

1034
01:11:09,730 --> 01:11:10,810
They might be walking up.

1035
01:11:11,090 --> 01:11:11,970
Flying over us.

1036
01:11:12,650 --> 01:11:13,450
Two teams flying in.

1037
01:11:13,450 --> 01:11:13,970
Coming, coming, coming.

1038
01:11:14,130 --> 01:11:14,970
On bridge, they're on bridge, on bridge.

1039
01:11:16,470 --> 01:11:16,830
Whoa.

1040
01:11:18,330 --> 01:11:20,010
Wait, there's a, there's an evil harvester.

1041
01:11:20,290 --> 01:11:21,630
That's the last evil harvester.

1042
01:11:22,390 --> 01:11:23,370
We already got, we already got three.

1043
01:11:23,530 --> 01:11:24,490
We already got three?

1044
01:11:24,730 --> 01:11:25,310
I thought we got two.

1045
01:11:25,770 --> 01:11:26,610
Oh, okay.

1046
01:11:26,690 --> 01:11:26,810
Yeah, we have three.

1047
01:11:27,490 --> 01:11:28,730
I didn't know any of them.

1048
01:11:28,950 --> 01:11:29,750
You see where these people are above us?

1049
01:11:30,330 --> 01:11:30,690
No.

1050
01:11:31,150 --> 01:11:32,390
I didn't, we needed to just get on.

1051
01:11:32,410 --> 01:11:33,990
They know they landed on bridge though is all.

1052
01:11:34,550 --> 01:11:36,690
I'm walking up, someone look at the bridge when we get up
here.

1053
01:11:37,290 --> 01:11:37,590
Please.

1054
01:11:42,220 --> 01:11:43,620
I'm gonna try to smash the whole area.

1055
01:11:43,820 --> 01:11:44,200
They're on the platform.

1056
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:45,000
Yeah.

1057
01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:46,720
Ooh, they ulted too.

1058
01:11:48,140 --> 01:11:49,460
You see anybody in this building?

1059
01:11:50,160 --> 01:11:50,800
There's a team there.

1060
01:11:51,160 --> 01:11:53,780
There's another team that redeployed to the bridge too.

1061
01:11:53,980 --> 01:11:54,700
There's another team on bridge.

1062
01:11:54,980 --> 01:11:55,540
Just right, just right, just right.

1063
01:11:55,660 --> 01:11:57,160
These guys, they're my fight and we're gonna have to throw
it.

1064
01:11:57,840 --> 01:11:58,860
There's a lot of people everywhere.

1065
01:11:59,020 --> 01:11:59,680
And we don't have any networks.

1066
01:12:00,320 --> 01:12:03,380
I saw them run it from redeployed to the bridge.

1067
01:12:03,400 --> 01:12:04,380
Do you have, do you have cells?

1068
01:12:05,100 --> 01:12:06,300
Yeah, do you need?

1069
01:12:06,780 --> 01:12:08,480
I want to charge this because it's my only gun.

1070
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:17,660
They're trying to get those charged senties off.

1071
01:12:18,420 --> 01:12:20,720
We might have to just hug Logan and run underneath them.

1072
01:12:22,820 --> 01:12:23,780
You have, like, no time.

1073
01:12:25,120 --> 01:12:26,380
I still have a fort, so.

1074
01:12:28,760 --> 01:12:30,220
No team is dying, though.

1075
01:12:30,920 --> 01:12:32,020
That's the scary part.

1076
01:12:33,500 --> 01:12:34,460
It's still right in front of us.

1077
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:35,160
These guys aren't moving.

1078
01:12:36,720 --> 01:12:37,320
Just go left.

1079
01:12:37,380 --> 01:12:37,840
Just go left.

1080
01:12:38,140 --> 01:12:39,180

We have to kill that team.

1100
01:13:52,890 --> 01:13:53,450
We have to kill that team.

1101
01:13:53,890 --> 01:13:54,930
We'll just wait for them to get a bubble.

1102

I'm farming them.

1118
01:14:12,510 --> 01:14:12,970
We can kill these guys.

1119

01:14:42,790 --> 01:14:44,770
I almost cracked it.

1149
01:14:45,210 --> 01:14:46,050
Do you have low-ball maybe?

1150
01:14:46,870 --> 01:14:48,210
No, yeah, no.

1151
01:14:50,530 --> 01:14:51,190
There's a team above us.

1152
01:14:51,290 --> 01:14:51,690
Team above us.

1153
01:14:51,950 --> 01:14:52,250
Yep.

1154
01:14:52,750 --> 01:14:53,530
Wait, I don't need this, maybe.

1155
01:14:55,370 --> 01:14:56,150
I have port, I have port.

1156
01:14:56,550 --> 01:14:58,630
Okay, I'm pro- Oh, this sucks.

1157
01:14:58,870 --> 01:14:59,850
There's actually so many people.

1158
01:15:01,270 --> 01:15:02,490
I don't see a team directly.

1159
01:15:02,650 --> 01:15:03,750
Are they just in here, riding?

1160
01:15:03,950 --> 01:15:04,570
Like, where are they?

1161
01:15:04,770 --> 01:15:05,670
I heard footsteps.

1162
01:15:06,250 --> 01:15:06,970
I can't- I'm gonna go scout it.

1163
01:15:07,070 --> 01:15:07,610
I'm gonna go scout it.

1164
01:15:08,210 --> 01:15:09,310
Let's just all go together.

1165
01:15:09,790 --> 01:15:10,310
They're right here.

1166
01:15:10,310 --> 01:15:10,570
They're right here.

1167
01:15:10,650 --> 01:15:11,170
They're just jumping out.

1168
01:15:11,270 --> 01:15:12,270
jumping down on the left.

1169
01:15:12,690 --> 01:15:13,570
We can just mirror this.

1170
01:15:14,310 --> 01:15:14,770
Yeah, yeah.

1171
01:15:15,450 --> 01:15:16,050
They scanned it.

1172
01:15:16,410 --> 01:15:19,730
I might have to port up through here and just get a port in
a lower launch, maybe.

1173
01:15:20,470 --> 01:15:21,370
So I think they're holding the round.

1174
01:15:23,010 --> 01:15:23,690
Yeah, they're hard holding.

1175
01:15:23,770 --> 01:15:24,190
We got to go around.

1176
01:15:24,250 --> 01:15:24,610
We got to go around.

1177
01:15:24,950 --> 01:15:25,810
We have to go now.

1178
01:15:26,370 --> 01:15:26,570
No.

1179
01:15:26,870 --> 01:15:28,190
I'm going to bat and then port from the corner.

1180
01:15:28,210 --> 01:15:29,070
There's a team in this building, okay?

1181
01:15:29,070 --> 01:15:29,410
Up here?

1182
01:15:29,570 --> 01:15:30,170
There definitely is.

1183
01:15:30,810 --> 01:15:31,610
All right, good luck.

1184
01:15:31,870 --> 01:15:32,390
Actually, just run it.

1185
01:15:32,410 --> 01:15:32,710
Just run it.

1186
01:15:32,770 --> 01:15:33,390
I think they're all going to buckle.

1187
01:15:35,310 --> 01:15:35,870
Jesus Christ.

1188
01:15:37,290 --> 01:15:38,230
Come off, come off, come off, come off.

1189
01:15:40,310 --> 01:15:40,970
There's a lot of barrels.

1190
01:15:43,050 --> 01:15:44,410
Oh, I'm going to drop a horn up here for you.

1191
01:15:44,630 --> 01:15:45,170
Gun for this.

1192
01:15:47,370 --> 01:15:47,790
All right.

1193
01:15:52,750 --> 01:15:53,190
Do you have Jen?

1194
01:15:53,850 --> 01:15:54,050
No.

1195
01:15:54,350 --> 01:15:54,610
I vote.

1196
01:15:55,610 --> 01:15:55,850
Okay.

1197
01:15:59,790 --> 01:16:01,430
You have to come and instantly look right.

1198
01:16:01,550 --> 01:16:01,990
Instant look right.

1199
01:16:02,110 --> 01:16:02,550
There's a team on our right.

1200
01:16:02,670 --> 01:16:02,970
Come on our right.

1201
01:16:03,850 --> 01:16:04,870
Try to Jen if you have it soon.

1202
01:16:04,990 --> 01:16:05,190
I don't.

1203
01:16:05,310 --> 01:16:05,710
Yeah, yeah.

1204
01:16:07,390 --> 01:16:07,630
Okay.

1205
01:16:07,710 --> 01:16:10,850
We try to, we watch the walk in and then we try to look left
at the third party and get some kills.

1206
01:16:11,830 --> 01:16:13,050
A full team's going to walk up right here.

1207
01:16:13,130 --> 01:16:13,890
We have to be the one to climb.

1208
01:16:17,270 --> 01:16:17,910
I'm looking.

1209
01:16:18,390 --> 01:16:19,430
It's a full team behind us right here as well.

1210
01:16:19,690 --> 01:16:20,010
Behind this rock.

1211
01:16:20,550 --> 01:16:20,970
Behind this rock.

1212
01:16:21,130 --> 01:16:22,290
They're shooting the rock now.

1213
01:16:22,410 --> 01:16:22,750
Rocked on?

1214
01:16:23,970 --> 01:16:24,330
Right here.

1215
01:16:24,510 --> 01:16:25,430
They killed the team.

1216
01:16:25,590 --> 01:16:26,870
This rock, this rock, this rock.

1217
01:16:26,970 --> 01:16:28,070
Okay, I'm looking at this.

1218
01:16:28,170 --> 01:16:28,890
I'm looking at this rock.

1219
01:16:30,770 --> 01:16:32,190
There's a team riding in this corner right here.

1220
01:16:32,330 --> 01:16:33,190
We might have to go kill them.

1221
01:16:34,390 --> 01:16:35,270
Or directly above us.

1222
01:16:35,330 --> 01:16:37,230
We're not scans above 95%.

1223
01:16:37,230 --> 01:16:38,070
Can you level up?

1224
01:16:38,650 --> 01:16:38,930
Yep.

1225
01:16:39,910 --> 01:16:40,230
Yeah.

1226
01:16:40,650 --> 01:16:41,290
Sold us.

1227
01:16:45,330 --> 01:16:45,910
Oh my god.

1228
01:16:45,910 --> 01:16:46,790
Care package guns.

1229
01:16:46,930 --> 01:16:47,890
I'm just grabbing both.

1230
01:16:49,890 --> 01:16:51,010
Okay, we need to look to kill them.

1231
01:16:51,030 --> 01:16:52,570
I think there's still a team riding above us.

1232
01:16:53,290 --> 01:16:54,550
They're sitting in this corner right above us.

1233
01:16:54,650 --> 01:16:54,790
I have all.

1234
01:16:55,050 --> 01:16:55,690
You want, I'm not all.

1235
01:16:56,710 --> 01:16:57,490
Do you have any nades?

1236
01:16:57,950 --> 01:16:58,950
No, no nades.

1237
01:16:59,210 --> 01:17:01,650
You look in the, there's nades here.

1238
01:17:01,770 --> 01:17:02,410
I've got, I have gold knocked.

1239
01:17:02,510 --> 01:17:02,850
I have gold knocked.

1240
01:17:03,030 --> 01:17:03,190
Here, here.

1241
01:17:03,830 --> 01:17:04,350
Here's a nade.

1242
01:17:05,070 --> 01:17:07,890
I want to drop this.

1243
01:17:08,350 --> 01:17:08,730
Drop the knock.

1244
01:17:08,850 --> 01:17:09,430
Riding in this corner.

1245
01:17:09,530 --> 01:17:10,110
Can we try to kill them?

1246
01:17:10,410 --> 01:17:11,370
Okay, someone grab this knock.

1247
01:17:12,170 --> 01:17:13,070
Uh, I got it.

1248
01:17:13,510 --> 01:17:14,010
Thank you.

1249
01:17:14,570 --> 01:17:16,150
I threw an aid here for you.

1250
01:17:16,570 --> 01:17:16,950
Any alt excels?

1251
01:17:17,410 --> 01:17:18,050
Can I get called Helmet?

1252
01:17:20,110 --> 01:17:20,470
Yeah, here.

1253
01:17:22,470 --> 01:17:23,330
I'm going to grab the innate.

1254
01:17:23,930 --> 01:17:24,650
Any alt excels?

1255
01:17:24,810 --> 01:17:25,410
I'm not going to have port.

1256
01:17:26,010 --> 01:17:26,730
Yeah, I've got one here.

1257
01:17:27,210 --> 01:17:28,170
Nope, I don't have any.

1258
01:17:29,010 --> 01:17:31,650
Yeah, I'm just going to go for another port and we're going
to have to pray it's fucking decent.

1259
01:17:32,990 --> 01:17:35,030
Maybe you can't try to see me kidnap somebody.

1260
01:17:35,390 --> 01:17:37,130
Can we wrap the logon and try to kill this team?

1261
01:17:37,210 --> 01:17:38,290
They're sitting like right in this corner.

1262
01:17:38,490 --> 01:17:39,310
Oh, there's a team right above.

1263
01:17:39,770 --> 01:17:40,210
I'm going to port.

1264
01:17:40,330 --> 01:17:40,550
I'm going to port.

1265
01:17:41,330 --> 01:17:43,690
I mean, if you want to just go for the kidnap.

1266
01:17:44,010 --> 01:17:45,090
Oh, true.

1267
01:17:45,850 --> 01:17:46,930
Just like it.

1268
01:17:47,590 --> 01:17:49,270
We both said true as well.

1269
01:17:49,470 --> 01:17:51,670
I mean, that's like...

1270
01:17:51,670 --> 01:17:52,210
Okay, take part, take part, take part.

1271
01:17:52,690 --> 01:17:52,910
Okay.

1272
01:17:53,090 --> 01:17:53,910
Instantly peek the corner man.

1273
01:17:54,010 --> 01:17:54,670
There's a team sitting here.

1274
01:17:55,750 --> 01:17:55,970
They're good.

1275
01:17:56,050 --> 01:17:56,150
They're good.

1276
01:17:56,310 --> 01:17:56,530
Hug the wall.

1277
01:17:56,650 --> 01:17:56,870
Hug the wall.

1278
01:17:57,210 --> 01:17:57,550
We're safe here.

1279
01:17:57,670 --> 01:17:57,930
We're safe here.

1280
01:17:58,010 --> 01:17:58,850
They're evacing right above us.

1281
01:17:59,410 --> 01:18:00,130
Just look up.

1282
01:18:00,150 --> 01:18:01,110
Just get a knock on here.

1283
01:18:01,450 --> 01:18:04,130
We gotta get a knock on here.

1284
01:18:04,570 --> 01:18:05,010
Yeah, we can look.

1285
01:18:05,050 --> 01:18:05,370
We can look.

1286
01:18:05,670 --> 01:18:06,370
Just wait for zone to close.

1287
01:18:06,470 --> 01:18:06,770
I'm marking it.

1288
01:18:06,790 --> 01:18:08,770
They have to take it up and we have to knock.

1289
01:18:09,970 --> 01:18:10,830
They're gonna peek above us.

1290
01:18:10,870 --> 01:18:11,950
The only place they kill us is above.

1291
01:18:12,510 --> 01:18:13,990
I'm gonna make sure nobody takes our port.

1292

Don't look.

1303
01:19:22,630 --> 01:19:25,190
If they can't see you, you can't see them too.

1304
01:19:25,970 --> 01:19:26,350
Oh wait, yeah.

1305
01:19:26,470 --> 01:19:28,630
We got the one with the care package gun kill because I
killed that lifeline.

1306
01:19:29,110 --> 01:19:29,550
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1307

Nice.

1308
01:19:30,390 --> 01:19:31,450
Care package gun kill.

1309
01:19:32,170 --> 01:19:33,770
Unfortunately, not looking too good.

1310
01:19:34,070 --> 01:19:35,770
We didn't use a survival item.

1311
01:19:36,110 --> 01:19:36,730
Oh, true.

1312
01:19:38,410 --> 01:19:39,330
I got the knock.

1313
01:19:39,770 --> 01:19:40,870
We got the heart three times.

1314
01:19:41,170 --> 01:19:42,530
I'm going to go for the kidnap for the point.

1315
01:19:42,910 --> 01:19:42,930
Okay.

1316
01:19:43,150 --> 01:19:44,270
I'm going to shut up and count.

1317
01:19:48,860 --> 01:19:49,820
Where are they?

1318
01:19:49,820 --> 01:19:52,740
I got him.

1319
01:19:53,080 --> 01:19:53,200

Yes.

1321
01:19:53,800 --> 01:19:53,880
Kidnap.

1322
01:19:54,300 --> 01:19:55,140
We did it.

1323
01:19:56,160 --> 01:19:57,100
Wait, did you actually?

1324
01:19:59,020 --> 01:19:59,620
It's okay.

1325
01:19:59,740 --> 01:20:00,640
We got the kidnap.

1326
01:20:03,380 --> 01:20:03,400
Okay.

1327
01:20:03,640 --> 01:20:04,000
So hang on.

1328
01:20:04,240 --> 01:20:05,460
I count one.

1329
01:20:06,880 --> 01:20:11,140
So from the top, we got FOV, three EVA harvesters, nades.

1330
01:20:12,980 --> 01:20:14,560
You only had two care pack weapons, right?

1331
01:20:14,680 --> 01:20:15,720
So we didn't have three.

1332
01:20:16,420 --> 01:20:17,040
Did you guys have it?

1333
01:20:17,320 --> 01:20:17,520
No.

1334
01:20:17,560 --> 01:20:18,500
No, I didn't.

1335
01:20:18,500 --> 01:20:18,880
Okay.

1336
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:19,660
You didn't get any knocks.

1337
01:20:19,820 --> 01:20:28,720
sniper did you no i got one shot so kid got the frag knock
got the shield cells got the no attachments and got the old

1338
01:20:28,720 --> 01:20:33,600
three times knock with the care package and you got the
knock with the care package that's nine we did the heart did

1339
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:43,320
we get the heart yeah yep okay heart oh nice good job damn
if we had one more care i don't think we got i mean 10 10

1340
01:20:43,320 --> 01:20:50,220
was the winning the winning last time yeah yeah but like i
think now people know but this time people didn't play comp

1341
01:20:50,220 --> 01:20:58,920
so yeah yeah people already know like uh like what to do
though yeah all right did we not get we didn't get any

1342
01:20:58,920 --> 01:21:06,140
knocks at the p20 right no oh unlucky no i shot at the
lifeline but i think you got that one which is still a win

1343
01:21:08,780 --> 01:21:16,040
that's unlucky yeah we're team six we got nine yeah typing
that was very satisfying

1344
01:21:20,820 --> 01:21:21,300
1420.

1345
01:21:23,580 --> 01:21:24,160
Not a joke.

1346
01:21:24,340 --> 01:21:26,680
I've ever played like a more shambles Apex Legends game.

1347
01:21:26,980 --> 01:21:28,300
That was that was so rough.

1348
01:21:28,700 --> 01:21:34,240
We I felt like you know it was going to be rough when you
know we already picked the wrong characters.

1349
01:21:35,640 --> 01:21:41,520
I know it was wraps after that honestly that one the the the
fuck up got us got us two points though we got the the care

1350
01:21:41,520 --> 01:21:43,460
package and the the kidnap.

1351
01:21:43,800 --> 01:21:51,860
That's true that's true but that was like honestly the most
skeptical game I've ever played.

1352
01:21:58,680 --> 01:22:00,300
Somebody got 11 down.

1353
01:22:00,640 --> 01:22:02,200
Oh, it was third.

1354
01:22:04,240 --> 01:22:05,980
Even though, like, that doesn't mean we win anything.

1355
01:22:06,400 --> 01:22:06,820
But we.

1356
01:22:07,300 --> 01:22:07,780
Oh, wait, no, no, no.

1357
01:22:07,780 --> 01:22:08,320
They didn't get 11.

1358
01:22:08,480 --> 01:22:11,000
They got the team 11 that got seven.

1359
01:22:11,300 --> 01:22:12,080
Seven team 11.

1360
01:22:12,360 --> 01:22:14,180
Well, that team got 10 anyways, unfortunately.

1361
01:22:14,600 --> 01:22:14,640
Yeah.

1362
01:22:15,080 --> 01:22:16,900
We were like one one.

1363
01:22:16,920 --> 01:22:18,600
We're in the top percentile.

1364
01:22:18,900 --> 01:22:19,860
Like, we got nine.

1365
01:22:20,100 --> 01:22:20,940
Like, good stuff, guys.

1366
01:22:22,320 --> 01:22:27,480
honestly they were easy they were not too bad to do in the
poi before we leave were we kind of in shambles without the

1367
01:22:27,480 --> 01:22:33,460
rotate yes but yeah i think it was smart to just do all the
challenges on the poi and then start leaving for like

1368
01:22:33,460 --> 01:22:40,140
because everybody's val everybody was val so like it didn't
hurt us rotating because everyone was just about rotating

1369
01:22:40,140 --> 01:22:46,480
out there's actually so many teams on edge almost every
single team just sits in their poi doing the challenges yeah

1370
01:22:46,480 --> 01:22:53,840
everybody almost every team had nine i guess we gotta we for
the last game we need to try to like do the ones quick and

1371
01:22:53,840 --> 01:22:59,620
then we i think we should look for uh a third party so we
can get the like the knocks with the guns and then like uh

1372
01:22:59,620 --> 01:23:07,240
because we can stick a down person too and then finish them
that would have been a lot oh yeah one of us gave one of us

1373
01:23:07,240 --> 01:23:13,380
gave that one team a finisher yeah gibby's ass sat on me bro

1374
01:23:18,900 --> 01:23:19,980
Just need...

1375
01:23:19,980 --> 01:23:21,700
Okay, I can do the heart again.

1376
01:23:22,140 --> 01:23:24,260
It's so... I didn't realize how that.

1377
01:23:24,340 --> 01:23:26,400
I forgot, like, the shield cells.

1378
01:23:27,260 --> 01:23:28,540
They can go anywhere.

1379
01:23:28,860 --> 01:23:30,360
That's the worst part.

1380
01:23:36,370 --> 01:23:38,550
My little scuffed heart.

1381
01:23:44,640 --> 01:23:45,140
Guys.

1382
01:23:48,160 --> 01:23:49,920
Why was the heart a challenge?

1383
01:23:50,040 --> 01:23:52,100
I thought, like, I was like, oh yeah, that's easy.

1384
01:23:52,220 --> 01:23:53,880
I can, like, just put down my shield.

1385
01:23:53,900 --> 01:23:55,340
And I was like, wait.

1386
01:23:57,380 --> 01:23:58,680
Wait a minute.

1387
01:23:59,120 --> 01:24:01,480
You cannot just put down your shoes.

1388
01:24:03,820 --> 01:24:05,560
You see the...

1389
01:24:05,560 --> 01:24:13,040
I mean, like, if we're talking about abstract here, like,
abstract-wise, it sort of looked like a heart.

1390
01:24:13,980 --> 01:24:15,320
Oh, my God.

1391
01:24:15,480 --> 01:24:16,240
That was...

1392
01:24:16,240 --> 01:24:17,760
That was fucking rough.

1393
01:24:18,660 --> 01:24:23,100
I think I spent, like, like, 80% of the time in that...

1394
01:24:23,100 --> 01:24:26,860
in our poi just try to make that fucking one heart

1395
01:24:29,920 --> 01:24:32,900
it's a modern art a team got 13.

1396
01:24:33,180 --> 01:24:39,800
holy shit what the fuck did you do we have one team that had
13.

1397
01:24:45,320 --> 01:24:57,620
well it's okay top five i think i mean from three from three
to like uh to not Nine points?

1398
01:24:58,040 --> 01:24:59,360
That's pretty good.

1399
01:25:00,140 --> 01:25:01,400
That's pretty good.

1400
01:25:04,580 --> 01:25:05,500
Top five.

1401
01:25:05,700 --> 01:25:06,640
No, no, no, no.

1402
01:25:06,980 --> 01:25:07,480
Top five.

1403
01:25:07,740 --> 01:25:09,340
Just top five.

1404
01:25:09,620 --> 01:25:12,500
Spam sales and then remove to get the heart.

1405
01:25:13,020 --> 01:25:14,900
Okay, but then you'll find enough sales for that.

1406
01:25:15,100 --> 01:25:18,160
The hardest part was I did not have enough sales for that.

1407
01:25:19,200 --> 01:25:21,920
That was the hardest part.

1408
01:25:23,060 --> 01:25:24,180
Improvement, exactly.

1409
01:25:24,380 --> 01:25:26,320
Every game we improve.

1410
01:25:27,300 --> 01:25:28,580
that's all that matters.

1411
01:25:28,820 --> 01:25:34,420
If every game we improve a little little bit, then that's
all that matters.

1412
01:25:34,800 --> 01:25:35,160
Epi Center?

1413
01:25:35,620 --> 01:25:36,120
Oh my, okay.

1414
01:25:36,220 --> 01:25:36,960
We have Survey 2.

1415
01:25:37,140 --> 01:25:37,900
Oh my God.

1416
01:25:38,180 --> 01:25:38,860
That's pretty good.

1417
01:25:39,440 --> 01:25:39,960
Yeah, that would have.

1418
01:25:39,980 --> 01:25:40,920
I thought it was just Epi.

1419
01:25:41,560 --> 01:25:42,420
That's pretty good.

1420
01:25:42,800 --> 01:25:43,360
Epi Survey.

1421
01:25:44,520 --> 01:25:45,620
What's the loop path?

1422
01:25:46,180 --> 01:25:47,100
One person Survey.

1423
01:25:47,400 --> 01:25:48,120
One person Epi.

1424
01:25:48,360 --> 01:25:50,000
One person Skyhook Tunnel.

1425
01:25:51,080 --> 01:25:51,960
Skyhook Tunnel.

1426
01:25:52,660 --> 01:25:53,180
Oh!

1427
01:25:53,360 --> 01:25:54,580
Well, that's what it is in Comp.

1428
01:25:54,680 --> 01:25:55,860
I don't know if people will.

1429
01:25:57,260 --> 01:26:02,680
well i mean everybody has like one pro player i guess
everyone has their their set drop spots too yeah i can do

1430
01:26:02,680 --> 01:26:08,380
the tunnel uh just in case there's people up there i can
just run away with some and then one person epic and

1431
01:26:08,380 --> 01:26:15,760
wherever the beacon is you just land on oh my gosh we're
gibby caustic valc so i don't really have a preference um on

1432
01:26:15,760 --> 01:26:21,900
where do you mind woodoki where you land i don't mind i
don't really have a preference caustic just go ep стор if

1433
01:26:21,900 --> 01:26:24,680
there's beacon yeah oh yeah i'll just go to the beacon

1434
01:26:30,940 --> 01:26:33,000
Should I do the no attachment one again?

1435
01:26:33,420 --> 01:26:33,940
Okay, FB.

1436
01:26:34,260 --> 01:26:35,220
I'll go where the beacon.

1437
01:26:35,460 --> 01:26:37,500
I had to make the P20 for most of that game.

1438
01:26:38,040 --> 01:26:43,520
I feel like the P20 person should have the no attachments in
the end.

1439
01:26:43,600 --> 01:26:44,300
That's what I feel like, too.

1440
01:26:44,400 --> 01:26:46,600
I feel like it's just easier to like justify.

1441
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:47,760
You do the attachments.

1442
01:26:47,980 --> 01:26:49,380
I'll do the grenade one then.

1443
01:26:49,740 --> 01:26:50,140
Okay.

1444
01:26:50,260 --> 01:26:51,080
Like hold all the nids.

1445
01:26:51,580 --> 01:26:52,480
Yeah, yeah, that sounds good.

1446
01:26:52,780 --> 01:26:54,200
Yeah, that sounds good.

1447
01:26:54,500 --> 01:26:56,400
And then I make the heart.

1448
01:26:58,680 --> 01:27:02,220
I feel like I'm going to waste most of my time trying to do
that.

1449
01:27:03,260 --> 01:27:05,080
No, you're actually different on it now.

1450
01:27:05,220 --> 01:27:06,520
From the one game, you like practice.

1451
01:27:08,260 --> 01:27:08,620
You're right.

1452
01:27:08,680 --> 01:27:09,960
I have the experience now.

1453
01:27:10,100 --> 01:27:10,920
It should be easy.

1454
01:27:11,380 --> 01:27:12,220
It should be easy.

1455
01:27:13,880 --> 01:27:14,740
Guys, where are my clips?

1456
01:27:15,140 --> 01:27:16,380
Guys, where am I?

1457
01:27:16,740 --> 01:27:17,620
Where am I?

1458
01:27:18,300 --> 01:27:20,380
Guys, you can't say clip that.

1459
01:27:20,460 --> 01:27:23,140
I still don't see any clips in the dokey clips.

1460
01:27:23,600 --> 01:27:25,140
In the dokey clips hashtag.

1461
01:27:29,900 --> 01:27:38,040
too busy watching so just gonna run a sniper every game and
try to knock somebody do something but what do you mean my

1462
01:27:38,040 --> 01:27:53,420
entire existence is funny this is why i'm a streamer my
entire life is a joke oh too real too real all right we have

1463
01:27:53,420 --> 01:28:03,240
i feel like hey we're faster now hour a game it is 30, 40
minutes a game where we're like cutting down our time.

1464
01:28:03,440 --> 01:28:05,440
We're speed running this chat.

1465
01:28:05,720 --> 01:28:06,340
That's great.

1466
01:28:06,540 --> 01:28:07,220
Thank God.

1467
01:28:07,880 --> 01:28:08,980
We made it pretty far though.

1468
01:28:09,280 --> 01:28:11,760
I don't think I can play like a six hour.

1469
01:28:11,780 --> 01:28:13,560
I don't think I can do six hours.

1470
01:28:13,900 --> 01:28:17,700
If you get a good zone because you can just do all the
things sitting in zone and then you just get everything else

1471
01:28:17,700 --> 01:28:19,020
done because you're just in God's spot.

1472
01:28:19,380 --> 01:28:20,320
I guess public people and stuff.

1473
01:28:22,260 --> 01:28:23,320
Don't heal a Joker.

1474
01:28:23,640 --> 01:28:24,560
Take your time.

1475
01:28:25,400 --> 01:28:36,200
But yeah, we still have we still have four more games left
chat these like it's just scary because like everybody's not

1476
01:28:36,200 --> 01:28:44,440
dying that's like the scariest part nobody is fucking dying
so like everybody is just trying to try to do their

1477
01:28:44,440 --> 01:28:58,640
challenges and I'm just like please spare me please please
spare us let us go let's This is N-Apex.

1478
01:28:58,880 --> 01:29:01,080
What do you mean nobody is dying?

1479
01:29:01,520 --> 01:29:02,800
We actually just weren't passing them.

1480
01:29:03,380 --> 01:29:05,560
What do you mean no one's dying?

1481
01:29:07,480 --> 01:29:09,940
This is N-A-Apex.

1482
01:29:10,840 --> 01:29:14,040
At least spare.

1483
01:29:16,860 --> 01:29:19,200
Three care pack weapons and three red armor.

1484
01:29:19,300 --> 01:29:21,540
Yeah, we weren't lucky enough to get the three red armor.

1485
01:29:21,880 --> 01:29:23,260
Oh my god, so money had one.

1486
01:29:23,620 --> 01:29:24,800
Thank god that wasn't me.

1487
01:29:25,580 --> 01:29:26,660
Guys, I told you we're in.

1488
01:29:26,680 --> 01:29:27,320
Improving.

1489
01:29:27,540 --> 01:29:29,080
We didn't have one.

1490
01:29:30,600 --> 01:29:31,340
Look at us.

1491
01:29:31,560 --> 01:29:32,680
We're getting better and better.

1492
01:29:33,280 --> 01:29:36,900
I think there's some teams that don't even put their points
because they're like, what's the point?

1493
01:29:37,080 --> 01:29:37,340
They didn't.

1494
01:29:43,420 --> 01:29:44,460
Oh my god.

1495
01:29:44,820 --> 01:29:45,360
Not last.

1496
01:29:45,960 --> 01:29:46,560
Not last.

1497
01:29:46,720 --> 01:29:47,120
We're in set.

1498
01:29:47,180 --> 01:29:48,120
Top five.

1499
01:29:48,400 --> 01:29:49,300
Top five.

1500
01:29:49,720 --> 01:29:50,900
That's what I like.

1501
01:29:53,640 --> 01:29:55,800
These relaxing moments between rounds.

1502
01:29:56,680 --> 01:30:00,620
Yeah, this is nice to It's nice.

1503
01:30:01,180 --> 01:30:10,360

long, you know, I just I Let me play the game.

1504
01:30:10,760 --> 01:30:12,240

01:30:20,260 --> 01:30:29,620

1508
01:30:37,760 --> 01:30:46,540

the things I had to do that was due yesterday I got like a

1509
01:30:46,540 --> 01:30:52,580

1513
01:31:25,580 --> 01:31:30,800

1514
01:31:31,120 --> 01:31:34,100
I'm so sorry I'll never sleep again.

1515
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:40,520
Let's see.

1516
01:31:43,460 --> 01:31:46,740
Wait, each and advances to the final...

1517
01:31:46,740 --> 01:31:48,920
Oh, wait, what?

1518
01:31:50,140 --> 01:31:52,400
Wait, they changed the rules.

1519
01:31:52,660 --> 01:31:56,660
If you win for most challenges per game, you advance to the
final.

1520
01:31:56,680 --> 01:31:57,260
finals.

1521
01:32:00,180 --> 01:32:01,680
I thought it was overall.

1522
01:32:02,940 --> 01:32:05,340
Yeah, we just have to get the most in one game.

1523
01:32:05,720 --> 01:32:08,900
The top team that wins the challenges for that game gets to
advance.

1524
01:32:09,300 --> 01:32:09,300
Yeah.

1525
01:32:10,280 --> 01:32:16,220
Yeah, I thought it was like I thought it was overall, but it
seems like... Yeah, but now... Well, it's actually like too

1526
01:32:16,220 --> 01:32:17,820
good for us for that three, the three.

1527
01:32:18,240 --> 01:32:19,320
At least that actually doesn't count.

1528
01:32:19,440 --> 01:32:20,040
We just have to...

1529
01:32:21,260 --> 01:32:24,360
So if you win just like one of them, you can go to the
finals.

1530
01:32:25,320 --> 01:32:25,700
Yeah.

1531
01:32:27,080 --> 01:32:34,220
So we got uh you just need like we gotta start getting some
of these like actual fighting ones the challenges we need to

1532
01:32:34,220 --> 01:32:42,380

impossible to fight people i had i had four set levels i had

1533
01:32:42,380 --> 01:32:50,480
four set levels and no attachments that you expect us to get
the fighting one i know i felt so bad like you were feigning

1534
01:32:50,480 --> 01:32:58,020
for that lobo all i was like no it's not ready they were the
babies here you're supposed to carry us i need to not do the

1536
01:33:05,340 --> 01:33:14,060
dokey wait me yeah i feel like you haven't been nerfed
enough yet like i'm but like you're on the p20 though yeah

1538
01:33:23,180 --> 01:33:29,880

1539
01:33:29,880 --> 01:33:39,020
mean i am nerfed i'm making the heart i'm making the heart
is a very hard thing to do like i can't loot when i'm making

I don't know what he's talking about.

1545
01:34:06,040 --> 01:34:07,420
What do you mean?

1546
01:34:07,800 --> 01:34:09,300
Okay, okay, no, no, no.

you.

1548
01:34:12,680 --> 01:34:13,480
I'm pretty sure.

1549
01:34:14,440 --> 01:34:15,420
I'm pretty sure.

1550
01:34:15,680 --> 01:34:22,800
If we look at stats here regarding our stream on Apex, I
just started two weeks ago.

1551
01:34:22,940 --> 01:34:26,140
So I have released our stream for Apex.

1552

everything you say i couldn't even get a liquidpedia anybody

1554
01:34:43,900 --> 01:34:50,800

my liquidpedia because my tournaments are not official

1555
01:34:50,800 --> 01:35:03,640

They're like, your tournaments are too much on content

1556
01:35:03,640 --> 01:35:07,480
creation and not pro enough.

1557
01:35:11,460 --> 01:35:15,040
Nobody can outsmart me.

1558
01:35:17,660 --> 01:35:19,020
Weird flex.

1559
01:35:19,720 --> 01:35:20,720

People try to make me a liquipedia.

1561
01:35:24,240 --> 01:35:24,840
It's a nice little zone.

1562
01:35:25,060 --> 01:35:25,700
We just sit there.

1563
01:35:25,840 --> 01:35:27,060
They like deleted it.

1564
01:35:27,060 --> 01:35:27,560
10 billion damage.

1565
01:35:27,820 --> 01:35:28,340

01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:35,560
Did we win?

1569
01:35:36,120 --> 01:35:38,380
Maybe, like, mentally, we've won.

1570
01:35:40,320 --> 01:35:48,100
We've won the mental battle.

1571
01:35:48,480 --> 01:35:50,180
That's all that matters.

1572
01:35:51,480 --> 01:35:52,560
It doesn't matter.

1573
01:35:53,200 --> 01:35:55,340
It doesn't... The other things don't matter.

1574
01:35:55,640 --> 01:35:57,100
We win the mental battle.

1575
01:36:05,200 --> 01:36:07,320
All right, remember to pick your legends this time.

1576
01:36:08,460 --> 01:36:08,920
Oh, shit.

No beacon?

1589
01:36:43,460 --> 01:36:44,580
We don't need beacon.

1590
01:36:44,960 --> 01:36:45,580

I'm gonna go up.

1612
01:38:17,100 --> 01:38:17,800
See if there's anything.

1613
01:38:18,100 --> 01:38:18,880
They're pushing us.

1614
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:19,420
They're entering us.

1615
01:38:19,520 --> 01:38:19,780
They're entering us.

1616
01:38:19,960 --> 01:38:20,300
Wait, what?

1617
01:38:20,620 --> 01:38:21,200

Trying to come link with you.

1621
01:38:28,340 --> 01:38:29,140

01:38:29,300 --> 01:38:30,200
Wait, what is this guy doing?

1623
01:38:30,360 --> 01:38:32,300

01:38:36,420 --> 01:38:37,080
Oh, my God.

1628
01:38:39,780 --> 01:38:40,640
I have no shield hills.

1629
01:38:40,860 --> 01:38:41,540
I'm flying on the rock.

1630
01:38:41,660 --> 01:38:42,000
They're walking up.

1631
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,280
I don't know when we're shot on the back of the building.

1632
01:38:48,600 --> 01:38:48,900
Popping soldiers.

1633

They're running up.

1639
01:38:58,020 --> 01:38:58,780
I'm popping soldiers.

1640
01:38:59,320 --> 01:38:59,360

01:39:08,520 --> 01:39:09,060

1824
01:46:36,590 --> 01:46:37,150
I'm dropping all my nades.

1825
01:46:37,450 --> 01:46:38,670
I just dropped all your nades there and I'll just do it.

1826
01:46:38,870 --> 01:46:39,410
We gotta hurry up.

1827
01:46:39,630 --> 01:46:40,470
Yeah, I'm picking up white meds.

1828
01:46:42,330 --> 01:46:42,570
Hey.

1829
01:46:42,970 --> 01:46:43,450
They flew in.

1830
01:46:43,550 --> 01:46:44,310
I didn't even drop it.

1831
01:46:44,490 --> 01:46:45,450
Yeah, they did.

1832
01:46:45,650 --> 01:46:46,690
On the balcony right now.

1833
01:46:46,970 --> 01:46:47,790
Okay, can you drop yours?

1834
01:46:47,830 --> 01:46:48,370
I have white meds.

1835
01:46:48,910 --> 01:46:50,770
Yeah, do all the nades on these bodies are here really
quick.

1836
01:46:50,870 --> 01:46:51,850
And then we're gonna run out.

1837
01:46:51,890 --> 01:46:52,750
Alright, I'm dropping my nades.

1838
01:46:55,830 --> 01:46:56,710
I got it!

1839
01:46:57,250 --> 01:46:58,010
Yeah, let's go quick.

1840
01:46:58,150 --> 01:46:58,870
You can pick up all your loot.

1841
01:46:58,950 --> 01:46:59,230
We gotta go.

1842
01:46:59,870 --> 01:47:00,830
You gotta, do you need white meds?

1843
01:47:00,930 --> 01:47:02,310
I'm dropping a med kit and four surges in here.

1844
01:47:02,330 --> 01:47:02,630
I have med kits.

1845
01:47:02,750 --> 01:47:03,130
I have med kits.

1846
01:47:03,310 --> 01:47:03,470
I'm good.

1847
01:47:03,470 --> 01:47:07,250
Yeah, we're gonna, we're gonna be looking for, we might
slide down and grab this and then try to play.

1848
01:47:07,290 --> 01:47:08,030
We're gonna have to play slow.

1849
01:47:08,710 --> 01:47:09,070
All right.

1850
01:47:11,250 --> 01:47:12,830
Is there anyone in graveyard in front of us?

1851
01:47:13,170 --> 01:47:13,730
I don't think so.

1852
01:47:13,750 --> 01:47:14,170
There's a harvester right there.

1853
01:47:14,890 --> 01:47:15,930
Yeah, let's play for this fence right here.

1854
01:47:16,150 --> 01:47:16,810
I'll grab the evo.

1855
01:47:16,930 --> 01:47:17,770
We can just go straight to the fence.

1856
01:47:17,910 --> 01:47:18,870
There's a team top mirage there.

1857
01:47:19,010 --> 01:47:19,330
So be careful.

1858
01:47:19,610 --> 01:47:20,210
Might beam you.

1859
01:47:22,050 --> 01:47:22,830
Oh yeah, they're looking.

1860
01:47:23,750 --> 01:47:24,910
You bubble it if you have to.

1861
01:47:25,870 --> 01:47:26,670
We finished our...

1862
01:47:26,670 --> 01:47:27,530
Do you have any syringes?

1863
01:47:27,750 --> 01:47:28,910
I only have med kits.

1864
01:47:30,330 --> 01:47:31,990
I'm dropping a Phoenix if you don't pop that.

1865
01:47:32,430 --> 01:47:33,610
Careful, they might need some of us.

1866
01:47:33,610 --> 01:47:34,230
We're not going to bubble here.

1867
01:47:34,330 --> 01:47:35,010
They're right above us.

1868
01:47:35,150 --> 01:47:35,390
I'm good.

1869
01:47:35,510 --> 01:47:36,370
I'm just going to mythic then.

1870
01:47:37,650 --> 01:47:38,470
We're going to have to...

1871
01:47:38,470 --> 01:47:40,590
We're going to use our third Velcro to get in the zone.

1872
01:47:41,090 --> 01:47:41,250
Okay.

1873
01:47:41,490 --> 01:47:42,230
Do you want to buff for it?

1874
01:47:42,350 --> 01:47:43,330
This is my last meds, by the way.

1875
01:47:43,890 --> 01:47:44,230
Oh, here.

1876
01:47:44,310 --> 01:47:45,050
I can give you a couple shield heals.

1877
01:47:45,330 --> 01:47:45,910
No, I don't...

1878
01:47:45,910 --> 01:47:47,610
No, my last like...

1879
01:47:47,930 --> 01:47:48,790
I can give you some.

1880
01:47:49,230 --> 01:47:50,070
What kind of heals do you need?

1881
01:47:50,130 --> 01:47:51,570
I just need syringes.

1882
01:47:51,690 --> 01:47:52,370
I don't have any...

1883
01:47:52,830 --> 01:47:53,610
I dropped three.

1884
01:47:54,750 --> 01:47:55,270
Wait, what?

1885
01:47:55,530 --> 01:47:56,210
Nading us, hitting us.

1886
01:47:57,110 --> 01:47:58,070
Bubble, bubble, bubble, bubble, bubble.

1887
01:47:59,130 --> 01:48:00,630
Oh, I hope it's in time.

1888
01:48:00,810 --> 01:48:01,250
I hope it's in time.

1889
01:48:03,770 --> 01:48:04,670
I'm playing back here.

1890
01:48:04,750 --> 01:48:05,050
I'm playing back.

1891
01:48:05,310 --> 01:48:06,410
We played to kill this thing.

1892
01:48:06,490 --> 01:48:07,090
Just play to kill this thing.

1893
01:48:07,990 --> 01:48:09,510
Can you maybe crawl to the back of this?

1894
01:48:09,530 --> 01:48:09,810
I don't know.

1895
01:48:10,930 --> 01:48:11,850
Oh, I can't.

1896
01:48:12,270 --> 01:48:14,970
This all is not your all, question mark.

1897
01:48:15,430 --> 01:48:16,050
Just keep crawling.

1898
01:48:16,170 --> 01:48:16,630
We can play res.

1899
01:48:16,730 --> 01:48:17,210
We can play res.

1900
01:48:19,710 --> 01:48:20,530
20 seconds on Bob.

1901
01:48:22,830 --> 01:48:23,370
Like, what's going on?

1902
01:48:23,590 --> 01:48:24,410
I don't know.

1903
01:48:24,990 --> 01:48:25,410
One died.

1904
01:48:27,110 --> 01:48:27,630
Popping a bat.

1905
01:48:27,810 --> 01:48:28,330
Can you play Res?

1906
01:48:28,470 --> 01:48:28,850
Can you play Res?

1907
01:48:31,270 --> 01:48:31,690
Just play Res.

1908
01:48:32,210 --> 01:48:33,350
We have to Res and lock all that.

1909
01:48:34,350 --> 01:48:34,990
I'm gonna drop my gold.

1910
01:48:35,290 --> 01:48:36,130
She should get 50.

1911
01:48:36,310 --> 01:48:36,770
She should get 50.

1912
01:48:38,170 --> 01:48:38,830
I'm here.

1913
01:48:38,970 --> 01:48:40,970
I'm dropping gold Res, but I'm dropping gold Res.

1914
01:48:42,230 --> 01:48:43,290
Oh, they snatched that shit.

1915
01:48:43,430 --> 01:48:44,710
Wait, Lilba snatched it.

1916
01:48:45,030 --> 01:48:46,070
Lilba snatched it.

1917
01:48:46,770 --> 01:48:47,790
We gotta pray they don't team us.

1918
01:48:48,310 --> 01:48:48,870
Oh my God.

1919
01:48:49,770 --> 01:48:50,610
That's so unlucky.

1920
01:48:50,750 --> 01:48:51,710
That is so unfortunate.

1921
01:48:52,830 --> 01:48:53,730
to the zone.

1922
01:48:54,850 --> 01:48:55,870
Oh, okay.

1923
01:48:56,130 --> 01:48:56,570
You survive.

1924
01:48:56,890 --> 01:48:57,790
I'll bub as soon as he drops.

1925
01:48:58,670 --> 01:48:59,170
Do you need to?

1926
01:48:59,390 --> 01:49:01,950
We have to just fly far and we might drop down into lava.

1927
01:49:02,110 --> 01:49:02,770
I think I might just die.

1928
01:49:05,330 --> 01:49:06,550
Oh, we're good.

1929
01:49:07,350 --> 01:49:08,010
Can you bubble instantly?

1930
01:49:08,210 --> 01:49:08,630
Bubb, bub, bub, bub.

1931
01:49:09,830 --> 01:49:10,650
Come on, bitch.

1932
01:49:10,810 --> 01:49:11,390
I'm Phoenixing.

1933
01:49:11,530 --> 01:49:14,110
We play this platform and we might have to drop down into
the lava.

1934
01:49:14,210 --> 01:49:14,750
I'm not sure yet.

1935
01:49:14,990 --> 01:49:15,770
Third harvester in front.

1936
01:49:16,130 --> 01:49:16,770
I don't have any.

1937
01:49:16,770 --> 01:49:17,770
We already got it.

1938
01:49:17,910 --> 01:49:18,210
We already got it.

1939
01:49:18,590 --> 01:49:18,830
Okay.

1940
01:49:19,270 --> 01:49:20,110
I don't have any healments.

1941
01:49:20,550 --> 01:49:21,750
Slide forward and then we have to look at her back.

1942
01:49:21,910 --> 01:49:22,610
Slide forward and look minus.

1943
01:49:22,830 --> 01:49:24,390
All right, I'm looking.

1944
01:49:24,570 --> 01:49:24,910
Loba, old.

1945
01:49:25,330 --> 01:49:25,970
LOS suspense.

1946
01:49:26,150 --> 01:49:27,470
And we got to look behind us.

1947
01:49:27,990 --> 01:49:28,950
Do any of you guys have?

1948
01:49:29,670 --> 01:49:30,070
Yeah, yeah, here.

1949
01:49:30,270 --> 01:49:30,810
Get on the ground.

1950
01:49:30,890 --> 01:49:31,710
Behind, behind, behind, behind.

1951
01:49:31,890 --> 01:49:32,510
In the corner, 120.

1952
01:49:34,490 --> 01:49:35,310
I can get it.

1953
01:49:35,470 --> 01:49:36,110
It's a solo Loba.

1954
01:49:36,710 --> 01:49:37,510
I'm just going med kit.

1955
01:49:37,930 --> 01:49:38,430
I'm going med kit.

1956
01:49:39,050 --> 01:49:39,230
I can't.

1957
01:49:39,230 --> 01:49:40,510
How long on, how long on next bubble?

1958
01:49:41,550 --> 01:49:42,470
10 seconds, 10 seconds.

1959
01:49:42,770 --> 01:49:44,970
Okay, we're going to swing wide and bubble and kill the Loba

You should take it.

I thought you were going to be...

1983
01:50:49,710 --> 01:50:50,310
The building, the building.

1984
01:50:51,830 --> 01:50:52,690

We have to slide up to their fence, okay?

1989

Slide to the fence, slide to the fence, slide to the fence.

1990
01:51:01,430 --> 01:51:02,550
They're right close, they're right close.

1991
01:51:04,730 --> 01:51:06,070
We're playing, so we're gonna play slow.

01:51:06,250 --> 01:51:06,810

1993

They're on you.

1999
01:51:15,510 --> 01:51:16,650
I was too thick.

2000
01:51:16,650 --> 01:51:17,830
I don't even think we live, I'm not gonna lie.

2001
01:51:17,930 --> 01:51:18,970
We were too thick.

2002
01:51:27,230 --> 01:51:28,350
Oh my god.

2003
01:51:29,290 --> 01:51:30,950
Bad idea to drop.

2004
01:51:32,990 --> 01:51:34,230
It's okay, I can watch.

2005
01:51:34,730 --> 01:51:45,850
like a couple of seconds it's okay how many times did we
welcome uh i think that was that was our third that was our

2006
01:51:45,850 --> 01:51:54,950
third yeah that was our third we should be fine i'm gonna
play for a longbow knock and a finisher i think that's too

2007
01:51:54,950 --> 01:51:58,970
thick there

2008
01:52:02,060 --> 01:52:05,880
is so many people oh

2009
01:52:10,040 --> 01:52:11,180
my gosh i just realized

2010
01:52:14,400 --> 01:52:15,800
I don't think... Do you have enough shields?

2011
01:52:16,060 --> 01:52:16,660
Oh, you do.

2012
01:52:19,260 --> 01:52:19,960
Oh, my God.

2013
01:52:30,340 --> 01:52:32,160
Do you have enough meds for this?

2014
01:52:33,300 --> 01:52:34,520
No, I'm probably just bad.

2015
01:52:34,640 --> 01:52:35,400
I'm out of shield deals.

2016
01:52:36,360 --> 01:52:36,680
Wait.

2017
01:52:36,900 --> 01:52:37,380
Oh, my God.

2018
01:52:37,440 --> 01:52:38,780
I think there's a rock I can sit by.

2019
01:52:38,840 --> 01:52:40,040
I might just walk all and go for that.

2020
01:52:41,980 --> 01:52:43,880
Oh, let's see if you make it.

2021
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:47,140
I mean, surely I'm dead if I just stay here.

2022
01:52:47,240 --> 01:52:47,760
I'm out of meds.

2023
01:52:47,860 --> 01:52:48,300
That's true.

2024
01:52:48,420 --> 01:52:49,240
Yeah, you might as well...

2025
01:52:49,240 --> 01:52:50,580
This is your last... Your hell, Mary.

2026
01:52:54,620 --> 01:52:56,200
Oh my god, it's in.

2027
01:52:57,120 --> 01:52:57,980
Holy fuck, it's in.

2028
01:52:58,360 --> 01:52:59,240
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2029
01:53:00,880 --> 01:53:03,020
There's only one sniper shot.

2030
01:53:04,560 --> 01:53:04,860
No.

2031
01:53:08,320 --> 01:53:08,620
Oh.

2032
01:53:10,100 --> 01:53:11,240
Oh my god.

2033
01:53:11,460 --> 01:53:12,420
You're not in, though.

2034
01:53:13,340 --> 01:53:14,480
I think I can climb up a little bit.

2035
01:53:14,580 --> 01:53:15,420
I'm out of meds, so.

2036
01:53:15,560 --> 01:53:15,860
I'm going to wait.

2037
01:53:15,860 --> 01:53:16,680
I'm going to wait till that second.

2038
01:53:17,540 --> 01:53:17,920
All right.

2039
01:53:18,420 --> 01:53:19,900
We got a cheese, a longbow knock.

2040
01:53:20,040 --> 01:53:20,980
We got a cheese, a longbow knock.

2041
01:53:22,300 --> 01:53:22,660
OMG.

2042
01:53:23,820 --> 01:53:25,260
Oh my god.

2043
01:53:26,040 --> 01:53:27,100
I can't believe this is happening.

2044
01:53:27,560 --> 01:53:30,340
You're like, you're like one shot away from dying.

2045
01:53:32,880 --> 01:53:35,260
There's, oh no!

2046
01:53:38,890 --> 01:53:40,330
I just hope no one looks at you.

2047
01:53:40,330 --> 01:53:40,490
Oh my gosh.

2048
01:53:40,690 --> 01:53:41,730
Do you have any heals?

2049
01:53:42,450 --> 01:53:43,610
No, I'm fully out.

2050
01:53:44,470 --> 01:53:44,670
No!

2051
01:53:45,050 --> 01:53:45,370
It's not!

2052
01:53:46,410 --> 01:53:46,810
Why?

2053
01:53:49,190 --> 01:53:50,710
What was that?

2054
01:53:53,510 --> 01:53:54,390
Zeroed them.

2055
01:53:56,910 --> 01:53:59,030
Bro, it's OOV down there.

2056
01:53:59,170 --> 01:54:01,820
I thought I could boost her up, but it's OOV and you can't
boost her at OOV.

2057
01:54:06,850 --> 01:54:10,950
One, two, three, four.

2058
01:54:14,750 --> 01:54:16,030
That's so jove.

2059
01:54:16,570 --> 01:54:21,410
Five, six, seven, eight.

2060
01:54:21,570 --> 01:54:22,730
I didn't know that was OOV, honestly.

2061
01:54:22,910 --> 01:54:24,050
That's like...

2062
01:54:24,930 --> 01:54:31,690
did we get nine again we got nine okay i actually i had to
recount because we actually got 10 i forgot to count we

2063
01:54:31,690 --> 01:54:38,870
didn't use a survival item oh it was actually 10 last game
so i had to recount to make sure okay someone fact-check me

2064
01:54:38,870 --> 01:54:47,470
someone fact-check me for this one what number you guys have
all right i'll put the picture up i don't even think because

2065
01:54:47,470 --> 01:54:51,930
i need what are the challenges could we could i have done
that game just the longbow knock where i knock somebody yeah

2066
01:54:51,930 --> 01:55:00,870
the longbow let's see we didn't have our comp last game
right or did we no we didn't we didn't we did this game okay

2067
01:55:00,870 --> 01:55:08,530
so we got that i mean you could have got 3 000 just to keep
four yeah just a little a little 2 000 damage just a little

2068
01:55:08,530 --> 01:55:24,360
farmer yeah uh you could you could've got the knock opponent
off evac tower uh one player drops a 2k damage game uh get

2069
01:55:24,360 --> 01:55:41,040
10 kills or more as a team and you're the team oh my god
it's okay we're consistent that's that's we're we're

2070
01:55:41,040 --> 01:55:47,700
improving was it nine it was a nine i thought it was ten i'm
asking you guys what this game oh let me look at it where's

2071
01:55:47,700 --> 01:55:59,960
the the board all right i'll look up to i thought we got ten
i got it let me look we got fov harvesters backpack wait so

2072
01:55:59,960 --> 01:56:17,900
one two three four five six seven eight nine ten we got ten
i think that's what i came up with too i also have yeah fov

2073
01:56:17,900 --> 01:56:27,660
one harvesters two backpack three all right it comp four
charge rifle five nade six survival item seven no

2074
01:56:27,660 --> 01:56:33,240
attachments eight alt nine am i missing one oh and the heart
10.

2075
01:56:33,820 --> 01:56:46,920
yeah 10 my heart it was the heart guys i put i posted 10 in
our chat uh only one other person so far got 10.

2076
01:56:47,080 --> 01:56:52,400
i don't know i feel like somebody's gonna have like 12 or 14
or somebody should realistically yeah like the last game

2077
01:56:52,400 --> 01:56:53,520
someone got 14.

2078
01:56:55,320 --> 01:57:00,300
so i feel like someone must have got 14 uh 14 or something.

2079
01:57:03,300 --> 01:57:04,880
Currently it's a tiebreaker.

2080
01:57:11,730 --> 01:57:16,910
I wonder how they did the game one because there was like a
three way tiebreaker or something, right?

2081
01:57:17,610 --> 01:57:18,170
I think they did.

2082
01:57:18,270 --> 01:57:21,490
I think they just gave it to whoever won the game or was
closest to winning the game.

2083
01:57:21,550 --> 01:57:22,330
The closest to winning?

2084
01:57:22,750 --> 01:57:23,750
What's our placement?

2085
01:57:26,690 --> 01:57:27,650
We got...

2086
01:57:27,650 --> 01:57:28,890
Oh, never mind.

2087
01:57:29,130 --> 01:57:29,670
Someone got 11.

2088
01:57:30,290 --> 01:57:31,550
It doesn't matter.

2089
01:57:32,190 --> 01:57:33,490
Someone already got 11.

2090
01:57:35,330 --> 01:57:36,010
damn

2091
01:57:41,270 --> 01:57:47,590
no what if i just edit 12

2092
01:57:53,010 --> 01:58:02,410
i guess new map new map time hopefully the cards like
hopefully a new card tempo says new cards oh it's up oh it's

2093
01:58:02,410 --> 01:58:16,210
up it's up i look one red armor oh my god it's easier i love
it knock yourself with a thermite okay we can do the pve for

2094
01:58:16,210 --> 01:58:23,430
sure is there a comp do a finisher i'm gonna look there
right now we need a caustic alt knock and we need get a

2095
01:58:23,430 --> 01:58:32,290
knock with valk rockets 300 damage with emp and we need
watson crypto the crypto one is kind of easy now crypto

2096
01:58:32,290 --> 01:58:40,570
caustic and watson and valk that's the watson one um watson
is draw heart with watson fence we could just play crypto

2097
01:58:40,570 --> 01:58:52,190
that just sounds like that's so easy i can do that again and
then there's rave too get the kidnap with portal um red

2098
01:58:52,190 --> 01:58:59,270
armor we also have to take the craft cannon three times oh
that's easy died out of bounds and he did that last game

2099
01:58:59,270 --> 01:59:07,930
what the 10 revives you could just sit there and spam spam
with somebody wait have take grab spam with opponent wait i

2100
01:59:07,930 --> 01:59:14,210
actually need to like collude with somebody wait does this
mean oh you have to win one person can do the grab cannon

2101
01:59:14,210 --> 01:59:21,210
thing because it's not three round trip does it not no it
just meant like it means like you go back and forth oh you

2102
01:59:21,210 --> 01:59:26,610
do three times yeah times three round trips yeah I'm just
saying you go back and forth three times because that's a

2103
01:59:26,610 --> 01:59:34,630
round trip okay what's the comp then we need what the Watson
one is free right yeah okay the crypto one's pretty free too

2104
01:59:34,630 --> 01:59:49,030
if we live right 300 damage yeah it's like two EMPs We can
literally just like one person one wait does any does do

2105
01:59:49,030 --> 01:59:58,470
they craft do any of them craft does crypto or Watson have
crafting for banners or no we can just play crypto and grab

2106
01:59:58,470 --> 02:00:03,870
the banner and drone I was just thinking oh yeah crypto
would right no I'm just thinking if there's crafting we can

2107
02:00:03,870 --> 02:00:08,370
just have one person fly literally fly outside map and then
we craft them

2108
02:00:12,240 --> 02:00:16,520
I mean, realistically, it's probably just Crypto Watson
Valk, I'd assume.

2109
02:00:16,640 --> 02:00:16,980
Crypto Watson Valk.

2110
02:00:17,140 --> 02:00:17,980
Yeah, we can do that.

2111
02:00:18,500 --> 02:00:24,100
We do Valk for the Oob as well and try to get someone with
the rockets, and then you can just...

2112
02:00:24,100 --> 02:00:25,660
Okay, so what are all the ones we can do in POI?

2113
02:00:25,780 --> 02:00:26,380
Knock with Therm.

2114
02:00:26,980 --> 02:00:29,020
Knock to PvE if we get a good POI.

2115
02:00:29,240 --> 02:00:31,180
Clear with melee if we get a good POI.

2116
02:00:33,280 --> 02:00:34,600
Don't use a survival item.

2117
02:00:34,860 --> 02:00:36,060
The Grav Cannon's doable.

2118
02:00:36,640 --> 02:00:38,440
That's just one person to do that.

2119
02:00:38,580 --> 02:00:40,940
Yeah, the Watson fence is doable.

2120
02:00:41,600 --> 02:00:49,160
doable ten revives doable that's pretty it's pretty azo is
it like full it's it's just knocked and revived right yeah

2121
02:00:49,160 --> 02:01:08,480
we literally just like pve that spam crouch with opponent
all right we can do that that's easy um a full inventory of

2122
02:01:08,480 --> 02:01:18,280
backpacks or sorry a full inventory of bats blue bag use all
three times wait a full inventory of bat batteries where's

2123
02:01:18,280 --> 02:01:25,280
that the bottom who's playing what oh my god that's a lot of
batteries

2124
02:01:28,740 --> 02:01:39,680
i can do crypto i suppose i feel like the battery thing is
like almost impossible yeah well we can either play um

2125
02:01:42,390 --> 02:01:48,810
actually i don't know i don't think i don't see Where is the
crypto one?

2126
02:01:49,210 --> 02:01:50,770
Dude, 300 damage with EMP.

2127
02:01:51,030 --> 02:01:52,670
Is that overall or like one EMP?

2128
02:01:53,410 --> 02:01:54,110
I think it's overall.

2129
02:01:54,350 --> 02:01:54,770
There's no way.

2130
02:01:55,390 --> 02:01:58,210
There's no way you can get that in one.

2131
02:01:59,390 --> 02:01:59,790
Yeah.

2132
02:02:00,250 --> 02:02:02,570
Like that's... I mean, unless you did it at the very end of
the game.

2133
02:02:02,710 --> 02:02:06,190
And like... I mean, we could just loot POI, do as many as we
can.

2134
02:02:06,810 --> 02:02:11,710
And then we just try to play UAV, Valcult to get an end game
to play the rest of the game what I guess.

2135
02:02:12,010 --> 02:02:12,010
Right?

2136
02:02:12,130 --> 02:02:12,470
Yeah.

2137
02:02:12,670 --> 02:02:13,030
Yeah.

2138
02:02:13,410 --> 02:02:14,630
We just have to avoid people.

2139
02:02:16,070 --> 02:02:16,730
Because we're playing.

2140
02:02:16,830 --> 02:02:17,690
I mean, actually, I don't know.

2141
02:02:19,250 --> 02:02:20,130
Hopefully we get a P.O.P.

2142
02:02:20,150 --> 02:02:20,930
If we get a P.O.I.

2143
02:02:20,950 --> 02:02:22,630
with PvE, we can get two of them automatically.

2144
02:02:22,890 --> 02:02:23,070
Yeah.

2145
02:02:23,610 --> 02:02:24,070
It's easy.

2146
02:02:27,730 --> 02:02:28,950
Do you want a Valk or Crypto?

2147
02:02:29,050 --> 02:02:29,850
I can play either, I don't know.

2148
02:02:30,370 --> 02:02:32,130
I can't play Valk, so I'll do.

2149
02:02:32,190 --> 02:02:33,010
All right, I'll go back.

2150
02:02:33,130 --> 02:02:35,090
And I'll draw a heart with my fences.

2151
02:02:42,870 --> 02:02:43,590
It's easy.

2152
02:02:43,910 --> 02:02:44,870
There's a P20 knock.

2153
02:02:45,210 --> 02:02:46,650
It's your favorite, Heemey.

2154
02:02:46,870 --> 02:02:49,190
Now you can have attachments to it.

2155
02:02:50,830 --> 02:02:51,690
Oh, my God.

2156
02:02:51,710 --> 02:02:52,770
I don't have to play on 90 of them.

2157
02:02:52,970 --> 02:02:53,330
Yeah.

2158
02:02:53,510 --> 02:03:07,230
yeah oh my god i just realized it's a great day my mood is
improved you got so much practice with the p20 girl i had

2159
02:03:07,230 --> 02:03:19,990
zero damage last game okay um what practice we didn't buy
i'll probably i'll shoot the spiders with my we're on cedo

2160
02:03:19,990 --> 02:03:30,590
cedo station cedo station new p.o.i is crazy there's no pv
there's no pve though and we're center map so oh it's

2161
02:03:30,590 --> 02:03:36,870
horrible we might have to we might have to just drop some of
them and just play for like the the end game stuff but we

2162
02:03:36,870 --> 02:03:44,570
could do the the grab cannon the grab one's kind of one of
us has to do it though not god not all of us have to be

2163
02:03:44,570 --> 02:03:50,910
there we can do the one at our poi we can do the one at our
poi but we gotta be careful three round trips like couldn't

2164
02:03:50,910 --> 02:03:58,610
we just take one round trip and that would be three if we
all just took it there and back wouldn't that be so i guess

2165
02:03:58,610 --> 02:04:07,690
round trips just each of us it doesn't say sing like single
person i guess it yeah i think does that count at the very

2166
02:04:07,690 --> 02:04:14,890
bottom it says use alt three times one person like it
specifies like if it's a one person challenge or a group so

2167
02:04:14,890 --> 02:04:22,370
i think we technically could all just yeah take it there and
back once and be done all right yeah we can do that wait the

2168
02:04:22,370 --> 02:04:30,030
200 damage with one frag we can just do that with pve can't
we we just group them all the spiders together would that be

2169
02:04:30,030 --> 02:04:36,850
200 damage would you damage points on the board oh i don't
know if it means spiders or not i mean we also have to do

2170
02:04:36,850 --> 02:04:49,090
pve with melee only so yeah i mean if we get the one melee
off oh is it all pve is melee or yeah clear pve with me so

2171
02:04:49,090 --> 02:04:54,970
that has to be all we have to clear it but that's like one
like spider yeah we had to fight with people for the pve but

2172
02:04:54,970 --> 02:05:04,810
i could throw one nade at like a prowler and get the bottom
one 200 damage maybe i don't think it would do 200 though i

2173
02:05:04,810 --> 02:05:10,650
don't know i don't know i guess we just have to make sure
somebody's hold up somewhere and then just throw a nade yeah

2174
02:05:10,650 --> 02:05:12,070
for like a whole team yeah

2175
02:05:16,950 --> 02:05:24,290
hmm hey now it's one red army wait we weren't winning though
how did someone got 14 so i mean last game somebody got 14

2176
02:05:24,290 --> 02:05:36,150
as well it's the same person they just duping challenges
it's the same person that got last one as well that's crazy

2177
02:05:36,150 --> 02:05:38,930
they got for game two

2178
02:05:43,320 --> 02:05:50,420
i wonder what they did to like hit all of that so fast they
probably just did the early ones and then had a good game

2179
02:05:50,420 --> 02:06:00,820
honestly yeah but two in a row they're so lucky senox why
aren't you as lucky as amu it's just impossible to get lucky

2180
02:06:06,700 --> 02:06:14,560
guys we have three more games guys three more it's okay we
don't make it to finals that means we have another chance in

2181
02:06:14,560 --> 02:06:22,440
the other two tournaments we're playing the long game here
we're playing a long game do you think it's so worth it if

2182
02:06:22,440 --> 02:06:26,820
we get a good zone we just rotate to it probably right and
we just do the ones in the building and play for like the

2183
02:06:26,820 --> 02:06:32,540
the damage and stuff we don't want to go to the finals yet
so we can do the other tournaments like the booster one

2184
02:06:32,540 --> 02:06:41,560
would take a long time it's the long con it's the long con
just the process i'll make it into the finals on the last

2185
02:06:41,560 --> 02:06:54,830
tournament oh that's just one where are my pod clips guys we
should just it wait for the team to take it oh my gosh we're

2186
02:06:54,830 --> 02:07:01,730
capping the cannons no i'd be oh no we should finish your
challenge finish your grab challenge and then just cap it

2187
02:07:01,730 --> 02:07:12,470
yeah no we should totally do that it's it's the plan and
before the crypto scans us though you know like i feel like

2188
02:07:12,470 --> 02:07:16,570
you're gonna throw a crypto drone wait

2189
02:07:22,450 --> 02:07:32,950
you guys send a clip you guys send a clip there's one clip
is this what the fuck is this why is it i'm sending this

2190
02:07:34,750 --> 02:07:39,320
this is my one clip i'm sending because that's the only clip
i have

2191
02:07:47,460 --> 02:07:50,420
i'm gonna write the only clip my chat was will

2192
02:07:55,520 --> 02:08:01,080
putting that in there that is the only clip you guys I can't
believe it.

2193
02:08:01,640 --> 02:08:01,640
Guys!

2194
02:08:03,900 --> 02:08:05,800

We need actual clips!

2198
02:08:18,700 --> 02:08:21,280
I'm busy editing another one.

2199
02:08:22,080 --> 02:08:23,720
Guys, I swear to fucking God.

2200
02:08:24,060 --> 02:08:24,940

Good!

2202
02:08:27,420 --> 02:08:28,520
Okay, here we go.

2203
02:08:29,080 --> 02:08:41,950
Wait, I'm gonna look at this clip i'm watching this oh my
god it's the fucking senox clip

2204
02:08:49,910 --> 02:08:57,130
all right here you go all right i'm posting that one too
it's okay we're gonna game the system if we have enough no

2205
02:08:57,130 --> 02:09:09,370
we can't have too many clips guys we can't guys i know my
clips are off it is if guys okay here's the plan we want

2206
02:09:09,370 --> 02:09:21,270
that thousand dollars that having clips off should not stop
us from this maybe we just get a crazy zone if you're

2207
02:09:21,270 --> 02:09:38,110
passionate enough it will not stop you there you us guys
this is a team effort everyone team effort crypto can scan

2208
02:09:38,110 --> 02:09:48,250
for enemies at least yeah only it's one emp so you're gonna
have to hit like a multiple team emp i think okay i'll try

2209
02:09:49,230 --> 02:09:55,270
hopefully we just get if we're in zone you can just wait
it's one emp like he said it was one zero seven it's one emp

2210
02:09:55,270 --> 02:10:02,470
and mine said yes oh okay that's like end zone shit right
there you might be able to land on the beacon and hit it

2211
02:10:02,470 --> 02:10:10,890
twice for double evo you should be able to actually
depending on the time am i pinging that's weird where is oh

2212
02:10:10,890 --> 02:10:19,670
hey sarcedo hey we have we have beacon isn't double you
anymore sorry i didn't mean to oh that's not i'm so sorry

2213
02:10:19,670 --> 02:10:24,810
it's fine it's fine it's good i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm gonna
loot out here and loot in someone can loot the big building

2214
02:10:24,810 --> 02:10:31,870
and then this and someone just get the middle and stuff i'll
get the middle and stuff i'll do here okay are you not

2215
02:10:31,870 --> 02:10:38,470
landing on the beacon wait i don't think you can anymore
apparently someone said my show watson can't wait do i land

2216
02:10:38,470 --> 02:10:45,010
on the beacon no you're the no just watson no i'm the beacon
oh shit okay guys you should be able to hit it twice so i'll

2217
02:10:45,010 --> 02:10:52,790
be here i'll do here then i got confused the scans see this
is why i'm the content creator i don't remember who does

2218
02:10:52,790 --> 02:11:01,130
what i'll do one wait can you not do twice we can all have
attachments right i guess not that's what someone said if

2219
02:11:01,130 --> 02:11:03,430
i'm believing him oh okay i won't I don't believe him.

2220
02:11:03,530 --> 02:11:04,790
I was that we were hitting it twice.

2221
02:11:05,110 --> 02:11:05,610
Oh, OK.

2222
02:11:05,630 --> 02:11:06,070
Maybe not.

2223
02:11:06,190 --> 02:11:06,450
Maybe not.

2224
02:11:06,590 --> 02:11:07,250
No, no, just wait.

2225
02:11:07,390 --> 02:11:07,490
Just wait.

2226
02:11:07,670 --> 02:11:07,790
I'm OK.

2227
02:11:08,290 --> 02:11:08,610
I don't trust.

2228
02:11:08,750 --> 02:11:08,970
I don't trust.

2229
02:11:09,350 --> 02:11:10,210
I'm the content creator.

2230
02:11:10,310 --> 02:11:10,590
I don't know.

2231
02:11:10,590 --> 02:11:10,910
We got good zone.

2232
02:11:11,070 --> 02:11:11,530
We got good zone.

2233
02:11:12,830 --> 02:11:13,490
Oh, my God, we did.

2234
02:11:13,910 --> 02:11:15,490
I think we might just play zone this game.

2235
02:11:15,610 --> 02:11:16,910
I'm not going to lie because we just get in.

2236
02:11:16,990 --> 02:11:18,670
We can do all of them for free.

2237
02:11:21,310 --> 02:11:21,750
Not me.

2238
02:11:21,830 --> 02:11:23,590

02:11:27,910 --> 02:11:29,230
You're literally a pro play.

You might as well just drop them just because.

2348
02:17:33,590 --> 02:17:34,510
That's a survival item.

2349
02:17:34,750 --> 02:17:36,170
I don't see it on this card.

2350
02:17:36,970 --> 02:17:37,350
Oh, it is.

2351
02:17:37,470 --> 02:17:38,110

I'm sorry.

2356
02:17:40,630 --> 02:17:42,110
There might be a team riding inside of here.

2357
02:17:42,270 --> 02:17:43,090
Just be careful, okay?

2358
02:17:43,350 --> 02:17:43,930
We're going in or not.

2359
02:17:45,490 --> 02:17:47,030
Oh, there's a team over there.

2360
02:17:49,690 --> 02:17:50,330
No team.

2361
02:17:50,470 --> 02:17:52,970
Okay, can you hit the UAV in barometer, which run again?

2362
02:17:53,510 --> 02:17:53,710
Yep.

2363
02:17:54,870 --> 02:17:56,430
Is there any way we can die to Uber on here?

2364
02:18:00,420 --> 02:18:03,480
I don't know if we're gonna be able to do that actually,
because we'd have to use our Moby to res.

2365
02:18:07,090 --> 02:18:10,530
I mean, you have the crypto drone to just fly to mobile res.

2366
02:18:11,490 --> 02:18:12,750
Yeah, but there aren't many in the zone.

2367
02:18:13,630 --> 02:18:14,010
There's one.

2368
02:18:14,390 --> 02:18:15,030
Let's hit the beacon.

2369
02:18:15,170 --> 02:18:16,870
We might be able to just get a good spot in zone, so.

2370
02:18:19,070 --> 02:18:20,070
I'm watching it.

2371

corner area.

Just crouch.

2394
02:19:52,500 --> 02:19:53,780
I'm literally being grieved from everywhere.

2395
02:19:55,600 --> 02:19:55,900
Jesus.

2396
02:19:56,320 --> 02:19:57,160

They're walking up, yeah.

2404
02:20:06,500 --> 02:20:07,660
One inch from the bloodhound behind the rock.

2405
02:20:07,880 --> 02:20:09,200
I can't see them right now.

2406
02:20:11,980 --> 02:20:12,700
I'm healing up.

2407
02:20:15,660 --> 02:20:17,660
You're full safe behind the trees back here.

2408
02:20:18,320 --> 02:20:18,580
Okay.

2409
02:20:18,760 --> 02:20:19,420
From there from the tower.

You're good.

2413
02:20:23,680 --> 02:20:25,720
We could just keep getting knocked to that tower, Sam.

2414
02:20:25,980 --> 02:20:26,580
For the knocks.

2415
02:20:26,980 --> 02:20:29,700

I'll wait for my ult and then we can put ult here.

2420
02:20:36,480 --> 02:20:38,440
Depending on next zone, we might just valkal and go by the
spot.

2421
02:20:39,300 --> 02:20:40,060
We're just kind of waiting for zone to pull.

2422
02:20:40,180 --> 02:20:41,440
Does anyone have a med kit or a white house?

2423
02:20:41,980 --> 02:20:43,680
I can give you two syringes.

2424
02:20:43,940 --> 02:20:44,440

2428
02:20:50,440 --> 02:20:51,220
Yeah, we do.

2429
02:20:54,980 --> 02:20:56,700

02:21:00,020 --> 02:21:00,580
That's really awesome.

2432
02:21:00,600 --> 02:21:02,940

but Gosh this team It's annoying.

2437
02:21:31,640 --> 02:21:33,860

02:23:48,300 --> 02:23:49,420
You could have gotten this res.

2470
02:23:49,740 --> 02:23:52,520
You could have easily res this.

2471
02:24:02,850 --> 02:24:04,010
What other challenges?

2472
02:24:04,390 --> 02:24:05,870
Are there any other challenges that we can get?

2473
02:24:05,930 --> 02:24:07,090
We've got red armor.

2474
02:24:07,410 --> 02:24:08,790
We got knock.

2475
02:24:08,950 --> 02:24:09,870
One, two, three.

2476
02:24:10,290 --> 02:24:10,750
me look.

2477
02:24:11,870 --> 02:24:13,650
Let me look since I'm fucking dead.

2478
02:24:13,870 --> 02:24:15,570
Have you knocked anyone with your bow rockets?

2479
02:24:15,870 --> 02:24:16,530
You could go for that.

2480
02:24:16,770 --> 02:24:17,710
I'll try to do that this time.

2481
02:24:17,890 --> 02:24:18,550
Go for that.

2482
02:24:18,850 --> 02:24:24,250
You could go for a finisher.

2483
02:24:25,210 --> 02:24:26,910
A 360 no scope with a sniper.

2484
02:24:28,530 --> 02:24:30,630
There's a sniper, a finisher.

2485
02:24:31,590 --> 02:24:33,010
I could craft you in Reza.

2486
02:24:33,190 --> 02:24:34,670
Should I try to Reza you guys in here for fun?

2487
02:24:34,770 --> 02:24:35,730
It counts as two Reza's now.

2488
02:24:36,470 --> 02:24:36,910
Yeah.

2489
02:24:37,730 --> 02:24:39,130
But is that wouldn't it?

2490
02:24:39,330 --> 02:24:39,670
Sure.

2491
02:24:40,290 --> 02:24:41,890
There might be a team still there, but sure.

2492
02:24:42,010 --> 02:24:43,190
There's so many teams back here.

2493
02:24:43,350 --> 02:24:44,050
I don't know how you can get there.

2494
02:24:44,850 --> 02:24:45,770
I am going to say.

2495
02:24:47,470 --> 02:24:50,710
If you can get a big ass nade, like a frag nade, 200 damage.

2496
02:24:52,610 --> 02:24:53,890
I would just try for those two.

2497
02:24:54,770 --> 02:24:55,830
I'm going to go for the Valkyro kids.

2498
02:24:56,330 --> 02:24:57,810
You've used your ult three times, right?

2499
02:24:57,950 --> 02:24:58,250
Have we?

2500
02:24:59,610 --> 02:24:59,830
Ooh.

2501
02:25:05,290 --> 02:25:07,610
Um, I think you used it two times, not three.

2502
02:25:07,670 --> 02:25:08,430
Yeah, I'm going to use it one more.

2503
02:25:08,590 --> 02:25:09,310
I don't live.

2504
02:25:10,390 --> 02:25:11,650
Oh, there they come.

2505
02:25:16,150 --> 02:25:16,990
Okay, what else?

2506
02:25:18,350 --> 02:25:19,110
I think that's it.

2507
02:25:19,190 --> 02:25:20,870
Unless you see a Trident driving by.

2508
02:25:22,010 --> 02:25:22,910
What was the Trident for?

2509
02:25:23,530 --> 02:25:24,590
Stick him with an Arc Star.

2510
02:25:26,890 --> 02:25:27,970
Wait, crouch spamming!

2511
02:25:28,050 --> 02:25:31,750
You can crouch spam and hope they crouch spam back before
they kill you.

2512
02:25:31,770 --> 02:25:33,210
Since you are a rat, that would be funny.

2513
02:25:33,710 --> 02:25:34,150
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2514
02:25:34,370 --> 02:25:34,590
Before...

2515
02:25:34,590 --> 02:25:36,050
Maybe I just run up on him and crouch spam.

2516
02:25:36,670 --> 02:25:37,590
Okay, but like not now.

2517
02:25:37,790 --> 02:25:38,270
No, that's who you are.

2518
02:25:38,490 --> 02:25:39,050
Yeah, do it for you.

2519
02:25:43,790 --> 02:25:44,210
It's okay.

2520
02:25:44,310 --> 02:25:46,810
If they AD spam you, that's a crouch spam.

2521
02:25:50,130 --> 02:25:51,010
That counts

2522
02:25:56,980 --> 02:26:05,540
Oh shit That's one You're so fucked Would they push you in
front of you

2523
02:26:24,160 --> 02:26:29,860
Okay I mute myself Because I don't want it to distract him
Because he's like super focused right now Someone come

2524
02:26:29,860 --> 02:26:36,660
cranks around with me This would have been amazing to play
as Watson right here Ugh No, it counts because they're

2525
02:26:36,660 --> 02:26:40,240
dodging your bullets by crouch spamming, so it counts, sort
of.

2526
02:26:41,400 --> 02:26:45,020
I'm just going to crouch spam for the rest of the game and
pray that someone kills me as crouching.

2527
02:26:46,200 --> 02:26:48,720
Make sure you get your Valkyrie knock first.

2528
02:26:49,400 --> 02:26:50,420
With your Q.

2529
02:26:50,920 --> 02:26:51,220
Yeah.

2530
02:26:53,260 --> 02:26:55,280
There's a full team right behind you.

2531
02:26:55,600 --> 02:26:56,660
Yeah, I hear them right over here.

2532
02:26:58,060 --> 02:26:58,540
It's okay.

2533
02:26:58,840 --> 02:27:00,420
Maybe they'll be crouched, too.

2534
02:27:02,040 --> 02:27:03,020
Find another rat.

2535
02:27:04,580 --> 02:27:06,280
Oh, you're in the middle of the zone.

2536
02:27:06,620 --> 02:27:08,000
That is not good.

2537
02:27:12,100 --> 02:27:15,240
I might just Valco when I get it and for 2% and just get the
point.

2538
02:27:15,400 --> 02:27:16,040
We need one more, right?

2539
02:27:16,080 --> 02:27:16,580
I've used it twice.

2540
02:27:16,760 --> 02:27:17,120
Yeah, you need white.

2541
02:27:17,220 --> 02:27:18,040
Yeah, you only use it twice.

2542
02:27:18,540 --> 02:27:19,780
You didn't use it the third time.

2543
02:27:19,900 --> 02:27:21,300
You might as well pair marry this.

2544
02:27:22,140 --> 02:27:22,820
You don't know.

2545
02:27:24,400 --> 02:27:25,500
Wait, but where would you go?

2546
02:27:26,480 --> 02:27:26,880
Oh, there is.

2547
02:27:26,980 --> 02:27:27,320
I'm dead.

2548
02:27:27,700 --> 02:27:28,540
There's nowhere to go.

2549
02:27:29,560 --> 02:27:31,080
You can't go anywhere.

2550
02:27:31,800 --> 02:27:33,840
At least you can see where everybody is.

2551
02:27:34,880 --> 02:27:36,780
Wait, land on top of the silo.

2552
02:27:37,220 --> 02:27:38,120
Could be safe.

2553
02:27:40,060 --> 02:27:41,880
Well, now you can't land on top.

2554
02:27:43,640 --> 02:27:43,840
Crash spam.

2555
02:27:44,400 --> 02:27:45,220
Go crash spam.

2556
02:27:46,200 --> 02:27:48,340
Maybe they'll be good to you.

2557
02:27:51,260 --> 02:27:53,820
Look, if they crouch once, that's considered a crouch spam.

2558
02:27:54,420 --> 02:27:54,840
Oh, yeah.

2559
02:28:00,940 --> 02:28:01,500
Nice.

2560
02:28:03,200 --> 02:28:04,040
Just live there.

2561
02:28:06,160 --> 02:28:21,440
Jesus Christ how many teams are there that's a lot oh no no
time you tried shit didn't even give you the chance you

2562
02:28:21,440 --> 02:28:34,860
should have spammed harder it was so close how many do we
have let's see I'm not sure this one seems a lot harder to

2563
02:28:36,200 --> 02:28:54,480
two three four uh i think we have six six seven seven i
think we only have seven get melee knock because the melee

2564
02:28:54,480 --> 02:28:59,500
not consider would pv i don't think i don't think i think
the melee knock has to be on a player.

2565
02:28:59,700 --> 02:29:00,360
Oh, seven.

2566
02:29:02,020 --> 02:29:03,100
We have seven.

2567
02:29:03,560 --> 02:29:04,740
Five, six.

2568
02:29:06,400 --> 02:29:06,780
Seven.

2569
02:29:07,420 --> 02:29:08,000
Wait, what are the eight?

2570
02:29:09,340 --> 02:29:09,900
We have eight.

2571
02:29:10,880 --> 02:29:11,640
One, two.

2572
02:29:12,460 --> 02:29:12,760
Eight.

2573
02:29:13,400 --> 02:29:13,520
Yeah.

2574
02:29:13,580 --> 02:29:13,980
We have eight.

2575
02:29:14,120 --> 02:29:14,440
We have eight.

2576
02:29:14,540 --> 02:29:14,960
Yeah, yeah.

2577
02:29:15,100 --> 02:29:16,020
I don't think that's a winner.

2578
02:29:17,300 --> 02:29:18,140
There's no way.

2579
02:29:18,200 --> 02:29:19,480
I feel like more teams got eight.

2580
02:29:19,780 --> 02:29:22,120
The highest in there is eight so far.

2581
02:29:22,200 --> 02:29:23,560
Yeah, but there's still teams alive.

2582
02:29:24,080 --> 02:29:28,780
I'm pretty sure teams alive are the ones that are going to
have the most.

2583
02:29:30,140 --> 02:29:34,900
maybe maybe we go back in the VOD and I was crouch spamming
and someone else across the map is crouch spamming pretty

2584
02:29:34,900 --> 02:29:40,880
sure you know you know I'm pretty sure that happened you
know when you were wingmanning that one team that was under

2585
02:29:40,880 --> 02:29:45,940
the bridge they were crouch spamming they were crouch
spamming they were try to dodge your bullets that's a nine

2586
02:29:45,940 --> 02:29:58,880
we're not gonna win but it's like the message we had done
earlier there's the get knocked 10 time that one the 10

2587
02:29:58,880 --> 02:30:06,240
revival and so well i feel like the out of bounds one we
could have done yeah sure the out of bounds one yeah 10

2588
02:30:06,240 --> 02:30:15,120
revives and out of bounds ones we could do and the crush of
the opponent i put us as nine because i counted the crush

2589
02:30:15,120 --> 02:30:23,200
we're not gonna win anyways just the message overall I

2590
02:30:29,850 --> 02:30:37,890
mean we could easily do the revive outside of zone yeah we
like hug zone and just keep rising yeah yeah we could have

2591
02:30:37,890 --> 02:30:46,910
done that thing or like just be at the edge of zone and then
just revive like we do this not revive not revive at the

2592
02:30:46,910 --> 02:30:58,650
edge of zone red armor is doable thermite doable BVE is
doable no survival items doable grab canna doable yeah we

2593
02:30:58,650 --> 02:31:03,530
just in this next game we need to do the die dot die to
bounce and rabbit or redstone time so we have to sit in zone

2594
02:31:03,530 --> 02:31:13,410
and hill yeah i think we get bad if we have a bad poi and a
bad like uh zone we can do that yeah just do edge i should

2595
02:31:13,410 --> 02:31:22,550
be easy or do we keep the valk or the crypto like we're
gonna the crypto was like mid but yeah i don't think we play

2596
02:31:22,550 --> 02:31:29,370
for the crypto EMP it's kind of high so i'm not gonna lie
yeah that's too hard to do um what else could help you guys

2597
02:31:29,370 --> 02:31:32,510
we do we're doing watson for the fence we could play

2598
02:31:39,610 --> 02:31:48,610
let's see because the fence was super easy i mean we could
do ray the portal or costa cults or costic i think costic is

2599
02:31:48,610 --> 02:31:58,410
nice uh either one i think costic is good for his own
control yeah with that plus watson we'd be like locked down

2600
02:31:58,410 --> 02:32:06,450
yeah people can't push us as easily i'm done okay uh do we
do valk just to get in the zone because we're gonna be

2601
02:32:06,450 --> 02:32:14,850
sitting in zone dying 10 times yeah we do valk caustic we
can play so we can we can craft brenner and rise and oob

2602
02:32:14,850 --> 02:32:20,950
without having to use a moby yeah like a conduit or loba
well what to get rid of one oh lifeline could help with the

2603
02:32:20,950 --> 02:32:26,370
revives we can't get rid of watson because we need watson
for the thing we could play lifeline for the red armor if

2604
02:32:26,370 --> 02:32:28,130
you want instead of caustic because it gives

2605
02:32:31,230 --> 02:32:45,050
anyway zero got 14 so yeah we were never gonna get close we
were second technically if they don't have another nine yeah

2606
02:32:45,050 --> 02:32:46,270
zero's team got 14.

2607
02:32:46,490 --> 02:32:48,570
i'm pretty sure they were like end game or something

2608
02:32:54,710 --> 02:32:59,350
damn if we were game three with second we could have
advanced to the finals

2609
02:33:08,670 --> 02:33:18,770
let's see what else is there do the battery one if we play
edge oh lifeline's good for the battery one actually because

2610
02:33:18,770 --> 02:33:25,470
you don't you get a ton of bats from the pack oh yeah i'll
do lifeline yeah yeah so you're doing my lifeline watson

2611
02:33:25,470 --> 02:33:30,830
what's the third val for the rotation yeah and then you have
the rockets

2612
02:33:37,190 --> 02:33:45,270
oh yeah this this tournament is pretty difficult these
challenges are hard i i think the hardest part chat right

2613
02:33:45,270 --> 02:33:54,030
now is just remembering the like I'm just like what's in the
challenges again it's so difficult to remember I'm just

2614
02:33:54,030 --> 02:34:03,590
listening to what they tell me to do because I'm like I
don't know I don't even know what the challenges are I'm

2615
02:34:03,590 --> 02:34:12,710
just like okay I'm just I'll just exist oh wait nice okay
this is a good clip good good guys thank you guys for

2616
02:34:12,710 --> 02:34:24,610
clipping it if we can't win If we can't win the fucking, the
tournament itself, we will win the Clips Challenge.

2617
02:34:29,120 --> 02:34:33,460
We will win the Clips Challenge instead.

2618
02:34:38,460 --> 02:34:41,220
I put the goodbye you're dead.

2619
02:34:42,460 --> 02:34:43,680
I put that chick clip in.

2620
02:34:44,200 --> 02:34:46,780
We gotta get this W somewhere.

2621
02:34:56,760 --> 02:34:58,240
I believe I got left for dead.

2622
02:34:58,860 --> 02:35:02,960
Wait, Tempo's running scrims at the same time as this
tournament?

2623
02:35:03,760 --> 02:35:04,360
No, what?

2624
02:35:04,840 --> 02:35:05,620
No, what?

2625
02:35:05,820 --> 02:35:07,120
He has seven monitors.

2626
02:35:08,000 --> 02:35:15,540
I just realized he's running the fucking Apex Pro scrims the
same time as this fucking tournament.

2627
02:35:18,400 --> 02:35:22,540
I saw him posted, like, here are the scores from today's
scrims.

2628
02:35:22,580 --> 02:35:25,920
I was like, wait a minute, there's a tournament going on.

2629
02:35:26,400 --> 02:35:38,340
What you mean here are the scores with today's scrims oh my
god don't wonder for those who don't know tempo runs the pro

2630
02:35:38,340 --> 02:35:46,180
pro team scrims in apex legends so not only is he running
this tournament but he's also running the scrims at the same

2631
02:35:46,180 --> 02:35:54,540
time so it makes sense why he has seven monitors he is
definitely multitasking right now he is we just need to

2632
02:35:54,540 --> 02:35:59,060
stack white mats then when we're looting Because we're
probably going to have to go sit in the zone for the whole

2633
02:35:59,060 --> 02:35:59,980
game to be able to get all.

2634
02:36:00,060 --> 02:36:03,200
Because if we sit in the zone, we get the out of bounds as
well.

2635
02:36:03,280 --> 02:36:04,040
We get the revives.

2636
02:36:04,180 --> 02:36:05,280
We get the extra bats.

2637
02:36:05,600 --> 02:36:08,720
And then that's just an extra three from what we had this
last game.

2638
02:36:09,420 --> 02:36:09,540
Yeah.

2639
02:36:10,380 --> 02:36:10,720
Yeah.

2640
02:36:11,120 --> 02:36:12,820
We have crafting right, right?

2641
02:36:13,000 --> 02:36:15,200
So we can literally, one of us can fly out of bounds.

2642
02:36:15,820 --> 02:36:16,900
Yeah, you can just die instantly.

2643
02:36:17,080 --> 02:36:17,460
We can craft.

2644
02:36:18,180 --> 02:36:19,620
Yeah, so we can get that point instantly.

2645
02:36:20,200 --> 02:36:23,020
Yeah, and we just play for support bins for the bats.

2646
02:36:23,560 --> 02:36:24,240
Mm-hmm.

2647
02:36:24,620 --> 02:36:25,760
Oh, my God, guys.

2648
02:36:26,160 --> 02:36:26,740
I just...

2649
02:36:26,760 --> 02:36:34,240
I just realized he added the melee remember when I told him
add a knockout with punch he actually added it we

2650
02:36:34,240 --> 02:36:43,580
contributed to the tournament look where is it get a melee
knock we contributed to the to the card I actually wrote

2651
02:36:43,580 --> 02:36:55,380
that to him we did it if we don't win anything at least we
had something on the card we helped guys all of us helped

2652
02:36:55,380 --> 02:37:05,800
together this is a group effort of contribution right there
nice achievement i can we get an edge i've contributed to

2653
02:37:05,800 --> 02:37:06,440
the tournament

2654
02:37:10,340 --> 02:37:22,920
wait what's our what's our our pli oh they're doing it right
now okay okay the And I can't believe this team got 13 We

2655
02:37:22,920 --> 02:37:28,960
would have we would have been oh we would have been like uh
We're second is zero one before

2656
02:37:36,980 --> 02:37:39,620
I don't believe it we were so close.

2657
02:37:40,220 --> 02:37:45,020
We were so close We're doing our part guys.

2658
02:37:45,020 --> 02:37:46,460
We have so many clips guys.

2659
02:37:46,540 --> 02:37:52,240
We're fucking Drowning clips right now Everybody said one
but I have three

2660
02:37:56,160 --> 02:37:58,480
I'm deleting the meow one.

2661
02:37:58,800 --> 02:38:00,140
I'm deleting it.

2662
02:38:01,820 --> 02:38:03,400
I'm deleting that.

2663
02:38:03,800 --> 02:38:05,580
This is not going to be on our record.

2664
02:38:06,180 --> 02:38:07,500
Because now we have more clips.

2665
02:38:07,680 --> 02:38:10,040
I'm going to delete the cat one.

2666
02:38:10,700 --> 02:38:12,600
That's not professional.

2667
02:38:13,100 --> 02:38:14,520
That is not professional.

2668
02:38:15,580 --> 02:38:15,840
Chad.

2669
02:38:16,040 --> 02:38:17,740
No, we're not keeping it.

2670
02:38:18,120 --> 02:38:20,000
Nobody's going to vote for it.

2671
02:38:20,300 --> 02:38:23,420
Guys, the votes are happening in...

2672
02:38:23,480 --> 02:38:24,600
Girl's Discord.

2673
02:38:25,020 --> 02:38:26,340
You're not in her Discord.

2674
02:38:28,060 --> 02:38:31,340
Her fans are going to be so confused.

2675
02:38:31,700 --> 02:38:32,500
Because the vote.

2676
02:38:32,620 --> 02:38:34,400
I don't rate her Discord, by the way.

2677
02:38:34,520 --> 02:38:36,780
I do not rate her Discord.

2678
02:38:37,380 --> 02:38:40,000
It has no gameplay.

2679
02:38:44,220 --> 02:38:44,900
No.

2680
02:38:45,680 --> 02:38:48,260
Guys, we're not rigging the vote.

2681
02:38:48,500 --> 02:38:50,300
We're not rigging the vote.

2682
02:38:50,580 --> 02:38:53,300
We have to give good content.

2683
02:38:53,480 --> 02:38:54,640
Oh man.

2684
02:38:55,060 --> 02:38:55,720
We got Jurassic.

2685
02:38:55,960 --> 02:38:56,500
We're center met.

2686
02:38:56,760 --> 02:38:59,660
We have to have good content.

2687
02:39:00,920 --> 02:39:03,540
Wait, but that's good for PvE though, isn't it?

2688
02:39:03,820 --> 02:39:05,280
There's no PvE there anymore.

2689
02:39:05,680 --> 02:39:06,640
Oh, wait, no.

2690
02:39:06,920 --> 02:39:07,480
There's no prouder's in the middle.

2691
02:39:07,860 --> 02:39:10,020
No, what's the point?

2692
02:39:12,620 --> 02:39:13,760
It's here, we have the cannons.

2693
02:39:13,920 --> 02:39:14,520
We have the cannons.

2694
02:39:16,440 --> 02:39:23,460
I think we're going to just have to loot the POI and thread
the needle and make it like a PvE and just avoid Zim's.

2695
02:39:23,480 --> 02:39:31,750
and like work our way out of zone if we want to do the the
the challenges let me see

2696
02:39:36,860 --> 02:39:49,280
all right don't worry it's fine we'll be fine i believe in
this maybe like the zone is like so far from us maybe so

2697
02:39:49,280 --> 02:40:05,260
it'll be fine oh my gosh i can't believe i can't believe
they've removed the I can't believe they removed the fucking

2698
02:40:05,260 --> 02:40:14,860
this is why I'm the content creator exactly this is exactly
why I am the content creator I didn't even remember where

2699
02:40:14,860 --> 02:40:23,120
the fuck the what I didn't even remember the new map does
not have PVE anymore I am the content creator of this team

2700
02:40:29,250 --> 02:40:38,950
it is fine respect we're not putting yabba it's not gonna
win us anything not gonna win us anything the only reason

2701
02:40:38,950 --> 02:40:44,410
you wanted there is because you wanted to show on girl
stream and that is why I'm exactly taking it out this is

2702
02:40:44,410 --> 02:40:58,670
exactly why I took out that clip because I'm not having that
clip show up on stream okay okay if if I put that clip back

2703
02:40:58,670 --> 02:41:11,780
if I put that clip back and we don't win you guys owe me
somewhere i will get that thousand dollars

2704
02:41:19,010 --> 02:41:22,070
i will get that somewhere

2705
02:41:26,990 --> 02:41:32,490
okay all right yeah all right all right i'll put it back in
i'll put it back in

2706
02:41:37,290 --> 02:41:44,390

this it's still there i just went by slight change in two of

2707
02:41:44,390 --> 02:41:54,370
the challenges okay here we go oh slight change because it
caused too much revives oh there's no more revives win a

2708
02:41:54,370 --> 02:42:01,450
game with less than 1500 damage which are the one day
changing get a knock with a mozambique win a game less than

2709
02:42:01,450 --> 02:42:08,390

you're like collude with a team and was like hey can you get

spamming like it was hard they just instantly killed you go

2718
02:43:31,390 --> 02:43:37,150
to crouch spam on someone they just But some of them crouch
spam to dodge bullets.

2719
02:43:37,270 --> 02:43:39,150
So you both crouch spam to dodge bullets.

2720
02:43:39,250 --> 02:43:40,610
It's considered crouch spamming.

2721
02:43:43,870 --> 02:43:44,610
There's that.

2722
02:43:47,170 --> 02:43:48,550
I hate being social.

2723
02:43:51,510 --> 02:43:59,310

02:45:15,270 --> 02:45:16,030
I'm already on Watson.

2738
02:45:16,190 --> 02:45:17,130
I don't have to worry.

2739
02:45:17,530 --> 02:45:17,970
Yeah.

2740
02:45:19,170 --> 02:45:20,650
Don't have to worry.

Alright.

2744
02:45:45,750 --> 02:45:46,310
Here we go.

2745
02:45:46,330 --> 02:45:47,510
And we got Beacon.

2746
02:45:48,010 --> 02:45:48,870
I guess they're...

2747
02:45:52,550 --> 02:45:56,570
There might be a universe where we just go to zone because
there's no resin ones anymore.

2748
02:45:57,810 --> 02:45:59,670
Wait, are we not going to fly off the map?

2749
02:46:00,050 --> 02:46:00,870
They got rid of it.

2750
02:46:00,970 --> 02:46:01,150
They got rid of it.

2751
02:46:01,170 --> 02:46:02,110
Oh, they got rid of it.

2752
02:46:02,770 --> 02:46:03,310
Oh, no.

2753
02:46:04,490 --> 02:46:05,850
There's no UB one either, right?

2754
02:46:06,290 --> 02:46:07,090
Yeah, no, they're gone.

2755
02:46:07,170 --> 02:46:08,510
No UB or you guys.

2756
02:46:09,310 --> 02:46:10,930
I'm just going to line close and line close.

2757
02:46:11,110 --> 02:46:12,310
Somebody do the...

2758
02:46:12,310 --> 02:46:12,890
I'll go over here.

2759
02:46:12,990 --> 02:46:13,550
I'll go do this.

2760
02:46:14,170 --> 02:46:17,590
One person loot this and then beacon and bunker and stuff.

2761
02:46:18,110 --> 02:46:18,150
I'll go right side.

2762
02:46:20,110 --> 02:46:21,090
I'll go right side.

2763
02:46:21,090 --> 02:46:23,090
I'll land in the back and look my way.

2764
02:46:24,470 --> 02:46:25,570
I'm gonna go to the tunnel.

2765
02:46:25,710 --> 02:46:26,290
I'm gonna do the tunnel.

2766
02:46:26,430 --> 02:46:26,950
I'm gonna do the tunnel.

2767
02:46:28,350 --> 02:46:29,070
Oh, I have a thermite.

2768
02:46:29,210 --> 02:46:29,870
I can do it right now.

2769
02:46:29,970 --> 02:46:30,390

Yeah, no, it's fine.

2774
02:46:35,490 --> 02:46:37,630
I'll just wait until you're closer and then I'll do the
thermite.

02:46:38,490 --> 02:46:39,030
Cool, cool, cool.

2791
02:48:01,890 --> 02:48:03,170
Yeah, no, no, I was doing my thermite.

2792
02:48:03,970 --> 02:48:04,230
Okay.

2793
02:48:06,330 --> 02:48:08,070
All right, I need the suck now.

2794
02:48:09,590 --> 02:48:10,870
Have you done the booster yet?

2795
02:48:12,230 --> 02:48:12,850
Actually, I don't know.

2796
02:48:12,990 --> 02:48:13,170
I don't know.

2797
02:48:13,190 --> 02:48:13,910
We shouldn't do this one.

2798
02:48:13,970 --> 02:48:14,890
The pylon team is going to kill us.

2799
02:48:14,970 --> 02:48:15,310
Let's go up here.

2800
02:48:16,530 --> 02:48:17,910
What is the booster one exactly?

2801
02:48:18,070 --> 02:48:18,550
Oh, here's a Mozamb.

2802
02:48:18,550 --> 02:48:19,090
We just hit the...

2803
02:48:19,090 --> 02:48:20,090
We have to hit the grab cannon.

2804
02:48:20,370 --> 02:48:20,730
Yeah, yeah.

2805
02:48:21,590 --> 02:48:22,010
I'm just...

2806
02:48:22,010 --> 02:48:24,230
I'm not in the senti if anyone wants to get a no scope knock
with it.

2807
02:48:24,430 --> 02:48:25,850
I'm doing the Mozamb right now.

2808
02:48:26,230 --> 02:48:26,530
Let's go.

2809
02:48:26,590 --> 02:48:27,190
Let's go up here.

2810
02:48:27,290 --> 02:48:27,550
Okay.

2811
02:48:31,050 --> 02:48:33,730
We might be able to do this grab cannon.

2812
02:48:33,930 --> 02:48:34,550
I'm not sure.

2813
02:48:34,770 --> 02:48:35,350
It's kind of risky.

2814
02:48:35,530 --> 02:48:36,370
It's sent him out.

2815
02:48:40,090 --> 02:48:41,090
It's an airdrop over here.

2816
02:48:41,330 --> 02:48:41,890
We should play for this.

2817
02:48:42,010 --> 02:48:42,570
We should play for this.

2818
02:48:44,170 --> 02:48:46,630
There was a team over here, so we might have to fight for
it.

2819
02:48:49,530 --> 02:48:50,110
Oh, man.

2820
02:48:50,410 --> 02:48:51,530
Maybe they won't have blue armor.

2821
02:48:51,670 --> 02:48:52,730
Maybe they're still white armor.

2822
02:48:55,390 --> 02:48:56,630
Are we not going to do the cannon?

2823
02:48:57,550 --> 02:48:59,610
I want to get the package because we can get red off of it.

2824
02:48:59,790 --> 02:49:00,350

Yeah, just give me a take it back.

2837
02:50:07,550 --> 02:50:09,870
And then you have to take it too.

2838
02:50:10,550 --> 02:50:11,830
Yeah, I already took it the one time.

2839
02:50:12,050 --> 02:50:13,190
I just stopped out for it.

2840
02:50:13,950 --> 02:50:15,630
All right, I've done my double.

2841
02:50:16,390 --> 02:50:17,170
So it's up to...

2842
02:50:17,170 --> 02:50:18,950
Actually, just take it back and come back to it.

2843
02:50:19,050 --> 02:50:19,750
I'm not even going to take it.

2844
02:50:19,830 --> 02:50:20,350
Oh, yeah, you're right.

2845
02:50:20,450 --> 02:50:22,050
I can just take it and then it'll be six.

2846
02:50:22,310 --> 02:50:22,610
Okay, that's six.

2847
02:50:22,790 --> 02:50:24,650
And then let's go for the PvE up here.

2848
02:50:24,690 --> 02:50:25,570
The PvE one's up here.

2849
02:50:26,350 --> 02:50:27,210
I need to drop my ult.

2850
02:50:28,250 --> 02:50:28,730
I might die.

2851
02:50:29,290 --> 02:50:30,190
You might have to take it back.

2852
02:50:30,950 --> 02:50:35,410
shooting at you shooting at you take it back take it back
take it back we craft them we craft them later just go craft

2853
02:50:35,410 --> 02:50:43,110
me go craft me go craft me there is a crafter not close to
us at all um you can play for cascade just play slow and

2854
02:50:43,110 --> 02:50:55,330
play for cascade uh i'll go back to cascade then all right
yeah just play cascade just play slow that's unlucky i'm

2855
02:50:55,330 --> 02:51:02,350
just gonna run a cascade first and if i die you don't go to
cascade all right just one of us stick together I feel like

2856
02:51:02,350 --> 02:51:09,510
it best if I just scout ahead because then you can just res
both of us if I die Yeah, that's much more easier.

2857
02:51:09,870 --> 02:51:10,930
So I'll just go up first

2858
02:51:14,170 --> 02:51:20,290
Because like at least for that you can get your red I feel
like you're gonna push though You can you rise on the we

2859
02:51:20,290 --> 02:51:25,430
might we might rise on the the spider choke The spider one
because we can do the spiders after they're not gonna go

2860
02:51:25,430 --> 02:51:32,390
craft and you head to the spider Got you you go ahead you go
to spider first I think there's a team there.

2861
02:51:32,590 --> 02:51:33,390
There's a team near me.

2862
02:51:33,690 --> 02:51:34,410
So I'll just grab you now.

2863
02:51:34,610 --> 02:51:36,090
You might have to get me on the waterfall, yeah, and we go.

2864
02:51:36,250 --> 02:51:36,830
No, I'm just going to grab you now.

2865
02:51:36,990 --> 02:51:39,010
So if I die, you might as well just craft.

2866
02:51:39,370 --> 02:51:40,290
Like I'm going to go the other way.

2867
02:51:42,010 --> 02:51:43,010
Maybe the one on your right.

2868
02:51:43,350 --> 02:51:43,610

02:55:46,670 --> 02:55:48,170
Wait, there's a sniper here.

2953
02:55:48,310 --> 02:55:49,170
Did you grab the sniper?

2954
02:55:49,450 --> 02:55:49,830
Yeah, you did.

2955
02:55:49,930 --> 02:55:50,070
Okay.

Uh, yeah.

2957
02:55:50,830 --> 02:55:52,210
I'm just looking for a Sentinel.

2958
02:55:59,870 --> 02:56:01,770
Yeah, there might be a team riding on top.

2959
02:56:01,930 --> 02:56:03,570
If there is, then I'm gonna have to, I'm gonna drop.

2960
02:56:03,850 --> 02:56:05,090
I will not be surprised.

2961
02:56:05,970 --> 02:56:07,770
I can put, like, fences at the bottom, too.

2962
02:56:07,970 --> 02:56:10,790
Yeah, put a bunch of fences up, and then if I drop, just
lifeline res.

2963
02:56:11,030 --> 02:56:13,590
They're gonna drop, so you have to get ready to instacel
them once you lifeline res, man.

2964
02:56:13,890 --> 02:56:14,170

2972
02:56:26,730 --> 02:56:27,190

2973
02:56:27,350 --> 02:56:27,790
Are you still?

2974
02:56:28,270 --> 02:56:28,690

I saw some shots.

3016
02:58:19,040 --> 02:58:19,760
Look for anything open.

3024
02:58:30,400 --> 02:58:30,980
They're going to push us.

3025
02:58:31,280 --> 02:58:32,160
Instantly get a gen down if you can.

02:58:43,980 --> 02:58:44,760
Trying not to take damage.

03:02:00,620 --> 03:02:01,440
They're directly underneath me.

3128
03:02:01,540 --> 03:02:02,960
I might try to go for a Mozam knock on them.

3129
03:02:03,000 --> 03:02:03,820
They're right down here.

3130
03:02:04,080 --> 03:02:04,200
They're right down here.

3131
03:02:04,200 --> 03:02:04,440

3132
03:02:05,840 --> 03:02:07,820

Play knockdown, play knockdown.

3238
03:06:37,140 --> 03:06:38,560
He's just sitting behind knockdown, now.

3239
03:06:39,640 --> 03:06:39,820
I

3240
03:06:53,290 --> 03:06:54,230
wanted to get the melee!

3241
03:06:55,930 --> 03:06:57,050
I had no more bullets!

3242
03:06:57,830 --> 03:06:59,470
Yeah, I ran out of ammo too.

3243
03:06:59,490 --> 03:07:00,670
I ran out of ammo too!

3244
03:07:01,090 --> 03:07:01,490
I know, well, fuck.

3245
03:07:01,670 --> 03:07:02,250
I know ammo.

3246
03:07:02,510 --> 03:07:02,910
I know ammo.

3247
03:07:03,330 --> 03:07:04,810
I know ammo there.

3248
03:07:05,310 --> 03:07:06,210
I honestly didn't know they got that Watson out.

3249
03:07:06,210 --> 03:07:06,870
I honestly didn't know they got that Watson out.

3250
03:07:07,010 --> 03:07:07,970
I had two.

3251
03:07:08,210 --> 03:07:08,850
I didn't know either.

3252
03:07:09,030 --> 03:07:11,290
When you killed that person, I was like, wait, why is that
not game over?

3253
03:07:11,530 --> 03:07:12,750
I ran out of ammo.

3254
03:07:13,490 --> 03:07:14,450
I had to admit it.

3255
03:07:14,810 --> 03:07:15,330
I had no ammo.

3256
03:07:15,530 --> 03:07:15,930
We all had nothing.

3257
03:07:16,910 --> 03:07:20,610
I used the last four bullets of a longbow and hipfire.

3258
03:07:21,150 --> 03:07:22,530
It's not like it was bad.

3259
03:07:22,650 --> 03:07:23,050
That is so close.

3260
03:07:23,190 --> 03:07:26,470
Maybe we got enough knocks overall.

3261
03:07:26,650 --> 03:07:27,670
We didn't see your damage.

3262
03:07:28,630 --> 03:07:29,730
We had way more than 1500.

3263
03:07:30,150 --> 03:07:32,950
Oh, we had 10 kills because we got the kills.

3264
03:07:35,210 --> 03:07:36,070
That's so close.

3265
03:07:37,010 --> 03:07:43,070

3275
03:08:23,670 --> 03:08:29,970

Oh, we play that so well, though.

Great job.

3283
03:09:17,540 --> 03:09:20,260
People are tallying up, and I don't see anyone with 12.

3284
03:09:21,220 --> 03:09:22,560
The winning team only had four.

3285
03:09:31,450 --> 03:09:33,770
Wow, that was, that was a pass, dude.

3286
03:09:34,210 --> 03:09:34,470
That was a huge.

3287
03:09:34,470 --> 03:09:36,290
I should have just threw and we would have won.

3288
03:09:43,850 --> 03:09:45,110
Wait, Lifeline's OP.

3289
03:09:45,810 --> 03:09:47,590
Dude, I know the fast res.

3290
03:09:48,010 --> 03:09:51,570
Oh, like I might, yeah, I'm definitely going to play her
again just because that was huge.

3291
03:09:54,690 --> 03:09:59,550
I mean, unless you think we have a better chance.

3292
03:09:59,830 --> 03:10:01,070
I think we play the same comp.

3293
03:10:01,510 --> 03:10:01,910
Do we do it?

3294
03:10:01,910 --> 03:10:02,630
It's pretty good.

3295
03:10:03,170 --> 03:10:05,950
The only one we missed was the cost of gold.

3296
03:10:06,530 --> 03:10:07,870
Just meleeing people and stuff.

3297
03:10:08,030 --> 03:10:09,130
And like a sentinel kill.

3298
03:10:09,290 --> 03:10:10,430
But for the most part, we got almost every.

3299
03:10:10,670 --> 03:10:13,370
Well, winning that game wouldn't have given us any more
points unless it was.

3300
03:10:13,530 --> 03:10:16,670
Yeah, it was just giving us like money and the, yeah.

3301
03:10:17,410 --> 03:10:18,410
That's so close.

3302
03:10:19,190 --> 03:10:20,650
But so far we have the most.

3303
03:10:21,050 --> 03:10:21,470
So far.

3304
03:10:21,810 --> 03:10:24,270
Guys, they should give us some pity points.

3305
03:10:24,290 --> 03:10:38,210

03:10:56,490 --> 03:10:59,310
five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve.

3308
03:10:59,450 --> 03:11:04,690
There's like eight more teams that have not, uh, have not
put their score in.

3309
03:11:06,390 --> 03:11:08,030
It can't, it can't still be counting.

3310
03:11:13,370 --> 03:11:14,330
Oh, okay.

3311
03:11:14,610 --> 03:11:14,910
Seven.

3312
03:11:15,590 --> 03:11:17,230
Oh my god, I'm like scared now.

3313
03:11:17,290 --> 03:11:18,070
I'm so scared.

3314
03:11:18,390 --> 03:11:21,230
Because like, if we get this, I don't have to try anymore.

3315
03:11:22,310 --> 03:11:24,270
Please, please not be...

3316
03:11:24,290 --> 03:11:25,510
Please be less than 12.

3317
03:11:26,690 --> 03:11:26,750
Please.

Not a lot.

3322
03:11:30,790 --> 03:11:31,570
End zero.

3323
03:11:36,510 --> 03:11:36,970
Four.

3324
03:11:38,430 --> 03:11:40,090
That was actually a crucial wingman drop.

3325
03:11:41,010 --> 03:11:41,810
Oh, my God.

3326
03:11:44,010 --> 03:11:44,910
This is it.

3327
03:11:46,930 --> 03:11:49,490
Oh, I was fracking, too.

3328
03:11:50,050 --> 03:11:51,870

there's another person hopping in they might have actually

3337
03:12:40,730 --> 03:12:46,530
because it took so long for them to calculate well no bro we
had we had most kills nobody got the 10 kill one either yeah

I need you guys to know my hands were shaking so fucking
much when it was at 1v1 i would have fucking it wouldn't

3346
03:13:47,370 --> 03:13:54,770
challenges this yeah if most challenges is 1500 and winning
the game is 15 yeah so like imagine if we would have had the

3347

caustic i dropped on the caustic i died to the caustic and i

clutch up oh my god i know yeah you said he was gonna get a
talking too oh my god wait wait was crusta watson uh he was

3365
03:16:21,130 --> 03:16:29,890
a focus on the watson i have no idea we did it guys was the
watson i'm not sure we're taking home a thousand dollars

3366
03:16:29,890 --> 03:16:36,430
maybe two thousand if we rate not we don't rate the clip so
what are finals is is finals the same team as you played it

3367
03:16:36,430 --> 03:16:43,910
or did they get random it's a whole new it's a whole new
game format i understand yeah it's it's uh random um because

3368
03:16:43,910 --> 03:16:50,270
it's like different it's like game modes from all three
tournaments combined together and it's random the other ones

3369
03:16:50,270 --> 03:16:55,730
seem too free to play and this one seems like the hardest
one it's like actually still cop apex like the other two uh

3370
03:16:55,730 --> 03:17:02,110
the two tournaments it's like mini game like hide and seek
and stuff like that well thursday is actual like thursday is

3371
03:17:02,110 --> 03:17:09,130
actual games though because there's duos team death matching
control points okay so that's the actual try those ones

3372
03:17:09,130 --> 03:17:13,390
might have those one those one might be easier than these
ones the win of the finals then 20 what day is the finals

3373
03:17:13,390 --> 03:17:21,450
the finals there's still two more yeah there's two more
weeks of the finals itself is on the 28th 21st are the

3374
03:17:21,450 --> 03:17:29,490
invitation to the finals all right well we did it we
qualified guys now we just get to survive now we don't care

3375
03:17:29,490 --> 03:17:37,390
we can so do we we can we can still go for most challenges a
team got game two and three and they counted them oh oh so

3376
03:17:37,390 --> 03:17:41,570
we can we can still play for it we'll play the same it
depends which one's easier we either play for the win for

3377
03:17:41,570 --> 03:17:46,850
1500 or we play for most challenges for 1500 i think the
challenges is easier yeah the challenges are easier if the

3378
03:17:46,850 --> 03:17:51,030
win comes it comes yeah let's just do the same thing let's
just go for most challenges again Perfect.

My mic is muted.

3384
03:18:00,010 --> 03:18:01,090
My push talk doesn't work.

3385
03:18:03,150 --> 03:18:04,150
My Discord does break.

We got one win!

3388
03:18:10,530 --> 03:18:11,710
That was my only goal.

3389
03:18:13,930 --> 03:18:15,370
You have to drop us.

3390
03:18:15,430 --> 03:18:16,190
My keyboard doesn't work.

3391
03:18:16,610 --> 03:18:17,190
Oh shit, wait.

3392
03:18:17,310 --> 03:18:18,030
Okay, never mind.

3393
03:18:18,430 --> 03:18:18,910
We're at wall?

3394
03:18:19,270 --> 03:18:19,570
Okay.

3395
03:18:20,750 --> 03:18:21,870
Are you lying to me?

3396
03:18:22,510 --> 03:18:23,250
No, no, no.

3397
03:18:23,690 --> 03:18:24,230
I don't believe.

3398
03:18:24,350 --> 03:18:26,330
I thought pro players have like four, like nine.

3399
03:18:26,330 --> 03:18:27,070
I'm good, I'm good.

3400
03:18:27,530 --> 03:18:27,990
It's good.

3401
03:18:29,170 --> 03:18:30,030
Ooh, just stretch.

3402
03:18:30,170 --> 03:18:30,450
Just stretch.

3403
03:18:30,810 --> 03:18:30,910
You're good.

3404
03:18:32,250 --> 03:18:33,650
No, that's all right.

3405
03:18:33,870 --> 03:18:34,850
We can always, we can just run to it.

3406
03:18:34,890 --> 03:18:35,390
Just stretch it.

3407
03:18:35,530 --> 03:18:36,010
There's nobody there.

3408
03:18:36,610 --> 03:18:37,650
We can take the grab can.

3409
03:18:38,670 --> 03:18:38,990
Ooh.

3410
03:18:39,630 --> 03:18:40,290
Okay, don't worry.

3411
03:18:40,470 --> 03:18:41,470
I'll pretend I crash my game.

3412
03:18:43,730 --> 03:18:45,370
I might have to take this gravity cannon.

3413
03:18:45,610 --> 03:18:45,910
No lie.

3414
03:18:46,430 --> 03:18:47,850
Okay, I'm like, no, no, no.

3415
03:18:47,930 --> 03:18:48,130
It's fine.

3416
03:18:48,130 --> 03:18:48,310
It's fine.

3417
03:18:48,370 --> 03:18:48,690
Let's stretch.

3418
03:18:48,930 --> 03:18:49,650
Oh, fuck.

3419
03:18:49,770 --> 03:18:50,170
Okay, now I...

3420
03:18:50,750 --> 03:18:52,330
Okay, now I guess I'll stretch too.

3421
03:18:52,570 --> 03:18:53,790
I'm so sorry, guys.

3422
03:18:53,870 --> 03:18:54,850
I thought I was going to...

3423
03:18:54,850 --> 03:18:55,330
No, it's fine.

3424
03:18:55,470 --> 03:18:55,590
It's fine.

3425
03:18:55,730 --> 03:18:58,550
We loot the POI and then we loot back to the prowlers when
you do PvE.

3426
03:18:59,010 --> 03:19:02,090
I just want you to know I have not fucking stretched in a
long time.

3427
03:19:02,490 --> 03:19:02,770
Yay.

3428
03:19:03,630 --> 03:19:04,630
You should do that, you know.

3429
03:19:04,710 --> 03:19:06,670
Sitting on a computer here all day is bad for you.

3430
03:19:06,730 --> 03:19:07,250
No, that's there.

3431
03:19:07,290 --> 03:19:08,090
I'll just die young.

3432
03:19:09,030 --> 03:19:09,310
No.

3433
03:19:09,450 --> 03:19:10,210
But not too young.

3434
03:19:10,390 --> 03:19:10,850
Not too young.

3435
03:19:10,970 --> 03:19:11,770
I'm rehabilitated.

3436
03:19:12,170 --> 03:19:14,970
If we get a good zone, we might just play for God's spot and
play for the one.

3437
03:19:16,190 --> 03:19:17,390
Because they're both even at this point.

3438
03:19:17,630 --> 03:19:18,410
Oh, we got a good zone.

3439
03:19:18,490 --> 03:19:19,010
You should go ahead, Beacon.

3440
03:19:19,370 --> 03:19:19,630
Okay.

3441
03:19:24,190 --> 03:19:26,390
Oh my god, I got too excited, guys.

3442
03:19:27,370 --> 03:19:28,630
I'll go hit the beacon.

3443
03:19:31,150 --> 03:19:32,250
I think it's Sentinel.

3444
03:19:32,370 --> 03:19:33,430
I'm going to go for the Sentinel knock.

3445
03:19:33,730 --> 03:19:34,370
I got a Mozi.

3446
03:19:36,190 --> 03:19:37,350

3447
03:19:38,750 --> 03:19:40,570

03:19:40,730 --> 03:19:42,710

Oh yeah, we can do that.

3467
03:20:37,770 --> 03:20:38,770

03:20:41,730 --> 03:20:42,750
We do need to be careful.

3470
03:20:42,830 --> 03:20:44,230
The zoo station team is going to come down.

3471
03:20:45,170 --> 03:20:45,970
Oh, wait, what the fuck?

3472

There you go.

3474
03:20:50,890 --> 03:20:53,590
Oh, I actually think we might just go to zone here.

3475
03:20:54,210 --> 03:20:55,590
I think it's just going to be pulling down here.

3476
03:20:55,950 --> 03:20:57,150
Oh, here's a Mozambique.

3477

03:21:02,130 --> 03:21:02,590
Let's go loot.

3480
03:21:02,630 --> 03:21:04,030
Let's go loot down to the tunnel and go to zone.

3481
03:21:04,290 --> 03:21:04,450
All right.

3482
03:21:05,750 --> 03:21:06,290
Oh, wait, the heart.

3483
03:21:07,230 --> 03:21:09,270
You can do the heart right now while you're waiting for us.

3484
03:21:09,790 --> 03:21:11,210
No, I don't think so.

3485
03:21:11,550 --> 03:21:11,970
All right, all right.

3486
03:21:12,010 --> 03:21:12,990
I don't have a...

3487
03:21:12,990 --> 03:21:14,470
Can we do the thermite one real quick here?

3488
03:21:14,670 --> 03:21:15,330
Yeah, we do it.

3489
03:21:15,330 --> 03:21:15,830
We can do it inside.

3490
03:21:16,450 --> 03:21:16,730
All right.

3491
03:21:17,070 --> 03:21:18,670
While you do that, I'll make the heart then.

3492
03:21:22,050 --> 03:21:23,070
I'm going to go scout spot.

3493
03:21:23,250 --> 03:21:23,630
Just be careful.

3494
03:21:23,790 --> 03:21:24,950
This team is going to walk up behind.

3495
03:21:25,450 --> 03:21:25,810
Wait, I'll do it.

3496
03:21:25,830 --> 03:21:26,290
I'll do it.

3497
03:21:26,570 --> 03:21:26,630
I'll do it.

3498
03:21:26,630 --> 03:21:27,010
I'll do it.

3499
03:21:28,350 --> 03:21:30,830
You can just res me and Senex can scout.

3500
03:21:31,530 --> 03:21:32,710
Yeah, I want to go scout spot.

3501
03:21:32,990 --> 03:21:33,550
Yeah, let him scout.

3502
03:21:35,190 --> 03:21:36,230
You have a Mozarm, right?

3503
03:21:36,290 --> 03:21:36,990
I don't need to pick one up.

3504
03:21:37,310 --> 03:21:37,850
Yeah, I have one.

3505
03:21:37,970 --> 03:21:38,130
You're good.

3506
03:21:38,490 --> 03:21:38,950
Yeah, perfect.

3507
03:21:40,710 --> 03:21:42,010
All right, we got the third might.

3508
03:21:42,850 --> 03:21:43,410
All right.

3509
03:21:43,410 --> 03:21:44,010
Are his shoots?

3510
03:21:44,350 --> 03:21:45,170
We're fighting up here.

3511
03:21:45,250 --> 03:21:46,090
We might third this.

3512
03:21:46,230 --> 03:21:47,450
Okay, I need to heal though.

3513
03:21:47,670 --> 03:21:48,070
Give me a sec.

3514
03:21:48,090 --> 03:21:48,430
Yeah, you're good.

3515
03:21:49,290 --> 03:21:49,610
Okay.

3516
03:21:50,230 --> 03:21:52,310
Can Mosey take the disruptors or the hammers?

3517
03:21:52,810 --> 03:21:53,630
Just hammers.

3518
03:21:53,890 --> 03:21:53,910
Just hammers.

3519
03:21:54,250 --> 03:21:54,850
Okay, okay.

3520
03:21:55,830 --> 03:21:59,790
All right, let me see if I can...

3521
03:21:59,790 --> 03:22:00,470
I got the heart!

3522
03:22:00,870 --> 03:22:01,670
Heart, heart, heart, heart.

3523
03:22:01,670 --> 03:22:02,530
Heart's done.

3524
03:22:03,030 --> 03:22:03,310

03:22:04,470 --> 03:22:05,650
I'm gonna come up and scout the booster.

3527
03:22:07,870 --> 03:22:09,030
No third on that party?

3528
03:22:09,690 --> 03:22:10,430
No, they're not fighting.

3529
03:22:10,550 --> 03:22:10,850
They're not fighting.

3530
03:22:11,010 --> 03:22:11,130
All right.

3531
03:22:11,810 --> 03:22:12,810
Where do we chill?

3532
03:22:13,330 --> 03:22:14,190
I'm gonna hit the booster.

3533
03:22:14,450 --> 03:22:15,110
Let me see if it's safe.

3534
03:22:15,530 --> 03:22:15,810
Okay.

3535
03:22:16,030 --> 03:22:16,750

3556
03:23:07,670 --> 03:23:08,270
We want this or the back building.

3557
03:23:08,450 --> 03:23:08,990
Look at both of them.

3558
03:23:11,070 --> 03:23:13,270

3559
03:23:13,670 --> 03:23:13,970

Nobody there.

3564
03:23:18,910 --> 03:23:19,610

Let's set up fences in, man.

3572
03:23:52,630 --> 03:23:53,610
We're gonna hold all this.

3573
03:23:53,650 --> 03:23:54,970
This bunker and that bunker.

3574
03:23:55,230 --> 03:23:55,290
All right.

3575
03:23:55,670 --> 03:23:57,230
Let's set up behind us and make sure nobody pushes us.

3576
03:23:57,470 --> 03:23:58,210
Okay, I'm setting up.

3577
03:24:02,110 --> 03:24:04,530
Want me to set up, how do you want me to set up fences here?

3578
03:24:04,890 --> 03:24:05,830
You just spam them.

3579
03:24:05,970 --> 03:24:06,590
Some people know we're here.

3580
03:24:06,750 --> 03:24:07,830
It doesn't have to be anything crazy.

3581
03:24:08,830 --> 03:24:09,350
We're here.

3582
03:24:10,210 --> 03:24:11,570
This one fence, so you know.

3583
03:24:12,630 --> 03:24:15,950
If we start getting shot in the back and we can't hold this,
we just slide down and play the bunker.

3584
03:24:16,670 --> 03:24:16,830
Okay.

3585
03:24:17,470 --> 03:24:19,090
Yeah, don't come over here.

3586
03:24:19,650 --> 03:24:21,270
You could call in your pack now, but...

3587
03:24:21,290 --> 03:24:21,950
the way if you want.

3588
03:24:21,970 --> 03:24:22,890
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, of course.

3589
03:24:23,830 --> 03:24:24,650
And Jen as well.

3590
03:24:25,070 --> 03:24:25,370
We're in.

3591
03:24:26,130 --> 03:24:27,330
Put more fences here.

3592
03:24:28,010 --> 03:24:28,850
In the middle of nowhere.

3593
03:24:29,830 --> 03:24:30,090
Whoa.

3594
03:24:30,630 --> 03:24:30,910
Chill.

3595
03:24:34,450 --> 03:24:34,770
Whoa.

3596
03:24:35,390 --> 03:24:36,430
Hey, your shots first, man.

3597
03:24:36,950 --> 03:24:38,170
You have a gold mag on the sniper.

3598
03:24:40,750 --> 03:24:42,590
So wait, let me open up the thing really quick.

3599
03:24:42,710 --> 03:24:43,630
Is it a no scope?

3600
03:24:44,090 --> 03:24:45,030
Knock with something.

3601
03:24:45,370 --> 03:24:46,930
Oh, I'm looking at an old one.

3602
03:24:48,550 --> 03:24:49,350
Does anyone have it open?

3603
03:24:49,730 --> 03:24:50,810
Or should I tap out and go get it?

3604
03:24:51,290 --> 03:24:51,810
Can I have it open?

3605
03:24:52,390 --> 03:24:52,710
What is it?

3606
03:24:52,770 --> 03:24:54,850
It's a no scope with sentinel and no scope irons.

3607
03:24:55,090 --> 03:24:55,690
Yeah, sentinel knock.

3608
03:24:55,850 --> 03:24:56,850
It can be charged up though.

3609
03:24:57,530 --> 03:24:59,670
And a 360 no scope with sniper.

3610
03:25:00,090 --> 03:25:01,130
I'll play for those, I guess.

3611
03:25:01,410 --> 03:25:02,150
Oh, you're nuts.

3612
03:25:02,610 --> 03:25:02,810
All right.

3613
03:25:03,530 --> 03:25:03,810
Let's see.

3614
03:25:03,810 --> 03:25:06,570
Can you gen just in this trench right here?

3615
03:25:06,610 --> 03:25:06,830
Yeah.

3616
03:25:07,370 --> 03:25:08,030
Just like right here?

3617
03:25:08,290 --> 03:25:08,710
Yeah, all right.

3618
03:25:08,890 --> 03:25:09,270
Yeah, right here.

3619
03:25:10,650 --> 03:25:10,890
All right.

3620
03:25:11,050 --> 03:25:13,190
We just have to win the fight when this team pushes us.

3621
03:25:13,830 --> 03:25:14,330
Be careful.

3622
03:25:14,530 --> 03:25:16,570
If you hear a valkalt, they might oob on top of us.

3623
03:25:16,610 --> 03:25:17,450
So we just got to be careful.

3624
03:25:17,670 --> 03:25:17,970
That's fine.

3625
03:25:18,270 --> 03:25:18,650
Don't worry.

3626
03:25:18,690 --> 03:25:19,470
I have fences here.

3627
03:25:19,790 --> 03:25:20,430
It looks dangerous.

3628
03:25:21,290 --> 03:25:23,930
now but i want you guys to know we actually had 13.

3629
03:25:25,350 --> 03:25:34,090
whoa wait how do we get 13 because we got seven or more
kills as a team and we got 10 or more kills whoa yeah nice

3630
03:25:34,090 --> 03:25:38,550
so we could have been like uh no no no we got 13.

3631
03:25:39,150 --> 03:25:46,110
yeah there's a small chance this pulls like the checkpoint
honestly hopefully it doesn't oh man you know what it's not

3632
03:25:46,110 --> 03:25:58,560
looking good that's good for overall most challenges a prize
yeah yeah most challenges completed per team how many bats

3633
03:25:58,560 --> 03:26:04,940
do you uh do you have i have three here yeah two plus a
phoenix kit that's not i'm gonna get one i'm good i'm doki

3634
03:26:04,940 --> 03:26:14,100

across if do you have poke to get the purple or no uh for

3635
03:26:14,100 --> 03:26:20,060

that's fine we play sure i don't want any waste suck i'm

3636
03:26:20,060 --> 03:26:20,860
gonna use my gen

3637
03:26:26,700 --> 03:26:28,440
I don't have any poke at all.

3638
03:26:29,060 --> 03:26:30,620
There's a Sentinel here with more ammo.

3639
03:26:31,320 --> 03:26:32,980
There's a blue bolt on this if you saw the mozone.

3640
03:26:33,680 --> 03:26:34,840
I got one on my...

3641
03:26:34,840 --> 03:26:36,520
Thank you.

3642
03:26:38,640 --> 03:26:40,040
This guy's very cringe.

3643
03:26:40,440 --> 03:26:42,360
This guy, yeah, actually, get a hobby.

3644
03:26:43,060 --> 03:26:43,740
You know what?

3645
03:26:46,920 --> 03:26:50,940
Who's Valking from over here, the north pad?

3646
03:26:51,640 --> 03:26:54,800
Could you put just a couple fences down on like our roof so
people see them?

3647
03:26:54,880 --> 03:26:55,500
Yeah, no problem.

3648
03:26:56,520 --> 03:27:03,520
I'm gonna take these fences away and then I'll put it on the
roof.

3649
03:27:04,660 --> 03:27:06,080
We're playing just for the win this game.

3650
03:27:06,200 --> 03:27:08,100
I don't think we've done enough to get the overall
challenges.

3651
03:27:09,060 --> 03:27:09,500
Yeah, we don't.

3652
03:27:09,780 --> 03:27:12,520
We need two more care packs to consider it.

3653
03:27:12,680 --> 03:27:13,360
Three alts.

3654
03:27:13,980 --> 03:27:14,660
Two more packs.

3655
03:27:14,680 --> 03:27:16,780
I could just revoke alt and count this too.

3656
03:27:17,520 --> 03:27:18,400
You could, you could.

3657
03:27:18,780 --> 03:27:21,020
I'm just gonna do, I'm literally just gonna revoke alt and
I'll come back down.

3658
03:27:21,320 --> 03:27:23,740
I wish we could do the PvEs.

3659
03:27:23,880 --> 03:27:25,360
Yeah, I don't think we can at this point.

3660
03:27:25,400 --> 03:27:26,380
I don't think we can, yeah.

3661
03:27:26,780 --> 03:27:27,700
We probably could have done that.

3662
03:27:27,760 --> 03:27:28,980
We definitely could have done the other one.

3663
03:27:29,100 --> 03:27:31,720
I honestly assume someone would take zone, to be honest.

3664
03:27:34,480 --> 03:27:36,000
Arc star, Arc star on that car.

3665
03:27:36,340 --> 03:27:37,740
Waco, get ready for them to land on our roof.

3666
03:27:38,080 --> 03:27:39,300
They just popped the Waco from the checkpoint.

3667
03:27:39,920 --> 03:27:40,340
Just look up.

3668
03:27:40,620 --> 03:27:41,900
We have a team rotating towards us.

3669
03:27:42,260 --> 03:27:42,840
I'm coming over.

3670
03:27:43,000 --> 03:27:43,740
I'm going to look above us.

3671
03:27:43,920 --> 03:27:44,200
We're good.

3672
03:27:44,240 --> 03:27:45,120
They're not going to summon us yet.

3673
03:27:45,280 --> 03:27:45,900
Somebody, hold on.

3674
03:27:46,740 --> 03:27:47,260
I'm here.

3675
03:27:49,200 --> 03:27:49,720
They won't.

3676
03:27:49,800 --> 03:27:51,000
I think this is, they might just hold this.

3677
03:27:51,120 --> 03:27:52,360
They might just hold that bunker there.

3678
03:27:53,380 --> 03:27:53,780
They won't.

3679
03:27:53,860 --> 03:27:54,940
My senses are scary.

3680
03:27:55,960 --> 03:27:56,280
Yeah.

3681
03:27:56,520 --> 03:27:57,440
I think they're just in there.

3682
03:27:58,660 --> 03:27:58,760
Turtling.

3683
03:27:59,220 --> 03:28:00,000
Park going right here.

3684
03:28:01,000 --> 03:28:01,220
Okay.

3685
03:28:02,060 --> 03:28:02,400
I'm looking.

3686
03:28:03,480 --> 03:28:06,600
I cannot, I don't have any scopes or range for anything.

3687
03:28:07,380 --> 03:28:08,320
I might be able to get you one here.

3688
03:28:08,340 --> 03:28:08,900
Do you need a one or two?

3689
03:28:09,000 --> 03:28:09,600
I have it on a probably.

3690
03:28:09,960 --> 03:28:11,040
Uh, yeah, that'll be great.

3691
03:28:12,620 --> 03:28:14,920
I'll need that for my P20 later too.

3692
03:28:15,820 --> 03:28:16,120
All right.

3693
03:28:16,800 --> 03:28:17,160
Quay!

3694
03:28:17,340 --> 03:28:18,460
Oh, what the fuck?

3695
03:28:18,760 --> 03:28:19,080
Chill.

3696
03:28:19,900 --> 03:28:22,840
I'm gonna charge up my armor for free.

3697
03:28:26,950 --> 03:28:27,890
Purple shotgun bolt.

3698
03:28:28,370 --> 03:28:29,370
I got it.

3699
03:28:30,710 --> 03:28:31,290
I'm good.

3700
03:28:32,190 --> 03:28:33,030
Oh, knocked Watson right here.

3701
03:28:33,290 --> 03:28:33,450
Nice knock.

3702
03:28:33,650 --> 03:28:33,950
Nice knock.

3703
03:28:34,150 --> 03:28:34,930
Flocko, Flocko, Flocko.

3704
03:28:36,270 --> 03:28:36,630
Flocko, Flocko.

3705
03:28:36,630 --> 03:28:38,010
Flocko, they...

3706
03:28:38,010 --> 03:28:38,850
I'm gonna walk up a little bit.

3707
03:28:38,910 --> 03:28:41,210
I'm gonna be able to, actually, no, no, no, no, it's our
skills.

3708
03:28:41,330 --> 03:28:41,470
Yeah.

3709
03:28:41,490 --> 03:28:41,930
I might die here.

3710
03:28:42,050 --> 03:28:42,350
Just gotta do this.

3711
03:28:42,350 --> 03:28:43,250
Bad idea.

3712
03:28:43,910 --> 03:28:44,650
Too many people.

3713
03:28:44,790 --> 03:28:45,370
Too many people.

3714
03:28:46,350 --> 03:28:47,730
I'm gonna pop a Phoenix.

3715
03:28:48,270 --> 03:28:50,130
My Watson also have charge, yeah.

3716
03:28:50,390 --> 03:28:51,590
Yeah, I'm gonna hop on it.

3717
03:28:53,150 --> 03:28:54,670
Oh, he was so close too.

3718
03:28:55,910 --> 03:28:56,990
Did you, uh, drum?

3719
03:29:00,110 --> 03:29:01,410
Yeah, I think they're going to push.

3720
03:29:02,510 --> 03:29:02,910
Thank you.

3721
03:29:02,910 --> 03:29:03,490
Oh, we're still in zone.

3722
03:29:03,850 --> 03:29:04,130
We're still in.

3723
03:29:04,850 --> 03:29:08,750
It's probably going to be this cluster of buildings, but if
we clear our edge, we should have a free walk in.

3724
03:29:09,170 --> 03:29:11,430
So we just have to win this fight on the scene that pushes
us on our edge.

3725
03:29:12,050 --> 03:29:13,970
I'm worried there's going to be a team coming from behind.

3726
03:29:13,970 --> 03:29:15,990
We should be, it should be pretty hard for them to push us.

3727
03:29:16,190 --> 03:29:17,050
This team should help us.

3728
03:29:17,090 --> 03:29:18,010
So we LOS left.

3729
03:29:18,310 --> 03:29:18,630
All right.

3730
03:29:19,310 --> 03:29:21,070
And we just play like the backside right here.

3731
03:29:21,210 --> 03:29:22,110
Wait, they're trying to rotate.

3732
03:29:22,250 --> 03:29:22,550
They're swinging.

3733
03:29:22,690 --> 03:29:23,550
They're swinging far right.

3734
03:29:23,950 --> 03:29:24,150
Okay.

3735
03:29:24,590 --> 03:29:25,110
What do you think?

3736
03:29:25,190 --> 03:29:26,230
I think I just saw something.

3737
03:29:27,050 --> 03:29:27,610
Whoa, chill.

3738
03:29:29,810 --> 03:29:36,290

right there are you serious they get a curber jesus christ

3739
03:29:36,290 --> 03:29:41,670

them at all he's gonna they're gonna like launch out one of

3740
03:29:41,670 --> 03:29:49,910
us i'm gonna grab this six x scope and snake a little if we
end up having to fight just fight through the right over

3741
03:29:49,910 --> 03:29:55,070
here if you have to okay all right and then worst case
scenario we slide back and we play in bunker with a gen

3742
03:29:55,070 --> 03:30:02,830
behind this team rotating oh there's a teammate here team to
north 22.

3743
03:30:03,610 --> 03:30:09,450
that's good are you they're rotating purple or no for
lifeline probably not i'm not there's a guy his teammates

no wait are you leaving wait that means that's another team

3746

charge Sentinel behind you.

3747
03:30:29,870 --> 03:30:30,630
All right, it's fine.

3748
03:30:30,690 --> 03:30:31,690
I have a...

3749
03:30:32,730 --> 03:30:33,610
This is bad.

3750
03:30:33,810 --> 03:30:34,130
I'm not...

3751
03:30:34,130 --> 03:30:35,070
Are they fighting out there?

3752
03:30:35,530 --> 03:30:36,390
Seven of me, yep.

3753
03:30:36,990 --> 03:30:37,610
Cracked one.

3754
03:30:39,630 --> 03:30:41,370
Over here, there's a catalyst here.

3755
03:30:41,850 --> 03:30:44,670
If they fight, I'm going to charge my Sentinel and run up
and try to knock one.

3756
03:30:45,030 --> 03:30:45,710
Oh, Jesus.

3757
03:30:48,790 --> 03:30:50,430
Is anybody looking at our backs?

3758
03:30:50,750 --> 03:30:51,390
I'm worried that...

3759
03:30:51,390 --> 03:30:52,310
Yeah, that's...

3760
03:30:53,210 --> 03:30:53,530
Yeah.

You're looking back.

I'm going to look at our side then.

3763

Oh, we got a creeper.

It's lifeline caustic.

Where is the team to the left?

3784
03:33:06,640 --> 03:33:07,880
I think they're in the lower.

3785
03:33:08,320 --> 03:33:09,220
I hear them sliding here.

3786
03:33:09,720 --> 03:33:10,420
Yeah, they're below us.

3787
03:33:10,440 --> 03:33:10,820
Below us, right here.

3788
03:33:11,060 --> 03:33:11,420
Yeah, close, close.

3789
03:33:13,520 --> 03:33:14,280
I'm gonna go for a curb shot.

3790
03:33:14,520 --> 03:33:14,780
I see them.

3791
03:33:14,800 --> 03:33:15,260
I see them.

3792
03:33:15,840 --> 03:33:16,320
Right here.

3793
03:33:17,400 --> 03:33:19,380
We can't fight them until we know there's nobody on our
right.

3794
03:33:19,700 --> 03:33:20,660
They're gonna try to fight us though.

3795
03:33:21,000 --> 03:33:21,480
They are, yeah.

3796
03:33:22,360 --> 03:33:23,160
They have hound caustic.

3797
03:33:23,360 --> 03:33:24,000
They're nading, nading, nading.

3798
03:33:24,100 --> 03:33:24,860
That might be them.

3799
03:33:29,010 --> 03:33:29,570
I'm looking.

3800
03:33:30,750 --> 03:33:31,310
We're playing to kill them.

3801
03:33:31,390 --> 03:33:32,030
We have to play to kill them.

3802
03:33:32,190 --> 03:33:32,570
I stunned two.

3803
03:33:32,970 --> 03:33:33,290
All right.

3804
03:33:35,050 --> 03:33:35,950
Cosmic at 190, 190.

3805
03:33:36,090 --> 03:33:36,590
Get ready to walk up.

3806
03:33:36,690 --> 03:33:37,130
I'm on the next time.

3807
03:33:37,190 --> 03:33:38,030
I'm walking, walking, walking, walking.

3808
03:33:38,110 --> 03:33:38,630
I'm at P20.

3809
03:33:39,910 --> 03:33:40,370
You're backing up.

3810
03:33:40,410 --> 03:33:40,930
I'm labeling on.

3811
03:33:41,570 --> 03:33:41,910
After that.

3812
03:33:42,530 --> 03:33:43,250
I stunned one on the right.

3813
03:33:43,670 --> 03:33:44,390
You can play slow.

3814
03:33:44,490 --> 03:33:45,290
You can play a little slow, still.

3815
03:33:45,370 --> 03:33:46,130
I'm going to play for a curve shot.

3816
03:33:46,710 --> 03:33:46,950
Careful.

3817
03:33:47,050 --> 03:33:47,390
Careful, Hemi.

3818
03:33:47,570 --> 03:33:48,510
You're really...

3819
03:33:49,490 --> 03:33:50,190
Oh, I'm blocked.

3820
03:33:50,550 --> 03:33:50,930

All right, I can't even have a shot from this guy.

3825
03:34:01,480 --> 03:34:01,940
Hopping a bat.

Oh, it's bad.

3833
03:34:36,520 --> 03:34:36,560
Yeah.

3834
03:34:37,740 --> 03:34:38,400
Good try.

3835
03:34:38,820 --> 03:34:40,220
That wingman is so...

3836
03:34:40,220 --> 03:34:41,780
Yeah, he had the wingman.

3837
03:34:43,940 --> 03:34:44,080
Oh.

3838
03:34:46,260 --> 03:34:47,100
That wingman helped.

3839
03:34:47,140 --> 03:34:48,540
It's okay, we thirsted their second.

3840
03:34:48,620 --> 03:34:49,400
We thirsted.

3841
03:34:49,800 --> 03:34:50,620
GG's, we made finals.

3842
03:34:50,620 --> 03:34:51,800
It's okay, we made finals.

3843
03:34:52,200 --> 03:34:53,300
That's all that matters.

3844
03:34:53,880 --> 03:34:55,320
What's our count for this line?

3845
03:34:55,540 --> 03:34:56,640
I don't even think it mattered.

3846
03:34:56,800 --> 03:34:57,700
That's not enough, yeah.

3847
03:34:57,900 --> 03:34:58,680
I don't think we're going to do that here.

3848
03:34:58,700 --> 03:35:00,300
We accounted for the overall.

3849
03:35:01,360 --> 03:35:02,000
You want to count?

3850
03:35:02,020 --> 03:35:03,960
Yeah, we should count it for the overall.

3851
03:35:04,140 --> 03:35:04,580
Yeah, yeah.

3852
03:35:04,900 --> 03:35:05,380
The overall.

3853
03:35:06,460 --> 03:35:07,100
That's fine.

3854
03:35:07,320 --> 03:35:08,260
We got the- Actually sucks.

3855
03:35:08,400 --> 03:35:11,740
I had shot this guy, but he had a purple helmet, so he
didn't die.

3856
03:35:12,200 --> 03:35:13,460
We did the knock with the thermal.

3857
03:35:13,940 --> 03:35:15,300
We didn't do any PVs, though.

3858
03:35:15,360 --> 03:35:16,020
No, we did not.

3859
03:35:16,100 --> 03:35:17,780
We were just playing through the- We did the gravity cannon.

3860
03:35:22,160 --> 03:35:22,820
We did the heart.

3861
03:35:23,120 --> 03:35:23,760
One, two, three, four.

3862
03:35:23,760 --> 03:35:24,340
Yeah, the heart.

3863
03:35:27,200 --> 03:35:27,780
That's it.

3864
03:35:29,540 --> 03:35:30,420
That's actually it.

3865
03:35:30,640 --> 03:35:31,720
Oh, and my old four times.

3866
03:35:31,740 --> 03:35:32,320
No survival.

3867
03:35:32,380 --> 03:35:33,340
No survival items.

3868
03:35:33,660 --> 03:35:34,380
Yeah, I counted that.

3869
03:35:34,440 --> 03:35:34,520
Yeah.

3870
03:35:34,540 --> 03:35:43,780
kind of that way it was uh before it was knock with the
thermite don't use survival gravity cannon watson heart and

3871
03:35:43,780 --> 03:35:51,820

3874
03:36:06,820 --> 03:36:07,440
All right, y'all.

3875
03:36:08,540 --> 03:36:09,080
Is this it, right?

3876
03:36:09,220 --> 03:36:09,660
It's the last game.

3877
03:36:09,740 --> 03:36:10,480
Yeah, that was last game.

3878
03:36:11,200 --> 03:36:14,900
Oh my god, this has been almost like four hours.

3879
03:36:14,980 --> 03:36:15,500
This was long.

3880
03:36:15,640 --> 03:36:16,060
This was long.

3881
03:36:16,180 --> 03:36:17,260
For six fans, it was long.

3882
03:36:17,840 --> 03:36:18,260
To be fair.

3883
03:36:18,340 --> 03:36:21,940
I mean, like, imagine if we could have walked up on this
nonsense, like this would have been free.

3884
03:36:22,320 --> 03:36:22,920
I don't know.

3885
03:36:22,980 --> 03:36:24,120
They're dying right now.

3886
03:36:24,960 --> 03:36:26,460
I know, but we would have been able to, like, walk up.

3887
03:36:26,740 --> 03:36:28,340
Or would I have wingman Krabry?

3888
03:36:28,500 --> 03:36:29,400
They're actually deleted.

3889
03:36:29,440 --> 03:36:30,440
We would have had triple Krabry.

3890
03:36:31,020 --> 03:36:31,540
That's true.

3891
03:36:31,720 --> 03:36:32,360
That's true.

3892
03:36:33,060 --> 03:36:34,520
Oh, wait, they get free red!

3893
03:36:34,540 --> 03:36:45,560
no someone push him oh that creeper yes come on he's
literally one hit it's so close wait why am i watching

3895
03:36:56,480 --> 03:37:04,860
insane game from them wait can we see the standings there's
no standings it's like a game each each game is its own

3896
03:37:04,860 --> 03:37:10,380
thing yeah there's there isn't any overall standings yeah
there's gonna be the only overall thing will be uh two most

3897
03:37:10,380 --> 03:37:20,200
skills overall yeah i don't think that's i had any of them
that's on the controller please it's a legit impossible i

3898
03:37:20,200 --> 03:37:30,560
mean this is rigged each team should have one controller
player that was fun that was fun ggs we made it to the

3899
03:37:31,680 --> 03:37:38,600
that's all it matters i know i'm so proud of us oh my god we
almost got like champion and finals that would have been

3900
03:37:38,600 --> 03:37:48,420
sick though that would have been so sick so we're not
allowed to play the other ones right no i think we are i

3901
03:37:48,420 --> 03:37:53,840
think we get invited i don't know why not yeah i think they
might not just invite because we already made finals uh

3902
03:37:53,840 --> 03:37:59,420
that's true they want to give everyone a chance at finals i
guess so yeah i'm gonna play on an altar or something but

3903
03:37:59,420 --> 03:38:02,480
it's not fair the sounds so fun.

3904
03:38:03,320 --> 03:38:06,820
There's the one of the, what's it, the Watson punch up.

3905
03:38:07,840 --> 03:38:09,300
And then the trio no weapons.

3906
03:38:09,640 --> 03:38:11,060
That sounds so fucking fun.

3907
03:38:11,920 --> 03:38:12,460
I agree.

3908
03:38:13,080 --> 03:38:13,460
Yeah.

3909
03:38:13,880 --> 03:38:15,660
Yeah, we actually got the hard one.

3910
03:38:15,780 --> 03:38:16,060
Yeah.

3911
03:38:17,040 --> 03:38:18,760
You actually have to like try it.

3912
03:38:18,920 --> 03:38:20,780
I thought the first one was the easiest.

3913
03:38:20,920 --> 03:38:22,320
That's why I signed up for it.

3914
03:38:22,700 --> 03:38:26,260
We're going to be watching the next week and they're just
going to be playing hide and seek, like hiding in bushes and

3915
03:38:26,260 --> 03:38:26,460
stuff.

3916
03:38:27,720 --> 03:38:28,960
I'm so sad.

3917
03:38:29,040 --> 03:38:37,620
I was like, oh man, this first one with the mini games that

other ones are so fun like I really wanted to do the the

3922
03:39:20,440 --> 03:39:30,300
March 21st with the the three strikes no weapons and Watson
punch out the Watson punch out is apparently like um the

3923
03:39:30,300 --> 03:39:33,780
players have to kill Watson character on the other team via
punching.

3924
03:39:34,220 --> 03:39:35,940
Like, that sounds so fucking fun.

3925
03:39:36,220 --> 03:39:38,640
I, I, you know, I'm just gonna be, I'm gonna ask him.

3926
03:39:39,700 --> 03:39:40,120
Tempo.

3927
03:39:40,440 --> 03:39:43,520
Can I still do the other, damn it!

3928
03:39:44,000 --> 03:39:47,200
Even though I got into the finals.

3929
03:39:51,400 --> 03:39:52,920
I'm gonna ask him.

3930
03:39:53,900 --> 03:39:57,400
Because the other ones sound so fun.

3931
03:39:59,440 --> 03:40:04,400
Let me in!

3932
03:40:04,440 --> 03:40:05,480
Let me in!

3933
03:40:07,780 --> 03:40:10,960
Let me in!

3934
03:40:11,380 --> 03:40:12,020
Let's...

3935
03:40:12,020 --> 03:40:16,040
I got...

3936
03:40:16,040 --> 03:40:17,300
Let her in!

3937
03:40:20,380 --> 03:40:21,020
Alright.

3938
03:40:21,920 --> 03:40:24,400
Anyway, they still have to apparently check the...

3939
03:40:25,100 --> 03:40:27,340
Check, like, to make sure, like...

3940
03:40:27,340 --> 03:40:29,040
Guys, do we have any cool clips, guys?

3941
03:40:29,620 --> 03:40:30,840
Do we have any more cool clips?

3942
03:40:30,940 --> 03:40:32,700
Because they're going to be voting for clips, I think.

3943
03:40:32,960 --> 03:40:34,780
Then put the letter in.

3944
03:40:35,860 --> 03:40:37,720
Guys, are there any more cool clips?

3945
03:40:38,220 --> 03:40:39,820
We can get, like, 3,000.

3946
03:40:40,580 --> 03:40:41,480
Wait, what was it, 2,000?

3947
03:40:41,480 --> 03:40:41,900
Sorry, no.

3948
03:40:42,000 --> 03:40:42,820
We can 2,000.

3949
03:40:43,040 --> 03:40:46,480
Wait, no, we can technically get 3,000 if we want two of the
clips.

3950
03:40:46,800 --> 03:40:48,860
If both of our clips are really, really good.

3951
03:40:52,040 --> 03:40:52,880
Okay, let's see.

3952
03:40:53,780 --> 03:40:55,220
All right, no, this is...

3953
03:40:55,220 --> 03:40:56,080

I did so...

3994
03:44:43,570 --> 03:44:46,110
I was so fucking cool in some of them.

3995
03:44:46,530 --> 03:44:48,310
Come on, we're helping you stand out.

3996
03:44:48,450 --> 03:44:49,170
That is true.

3997
03:44:49,730 --> 03:44:50,290
That is true.

3998
03:44:50,430 --> 03:44:53,430
But the people that are voting for this are all fucking Apex
Watchers.

3999
03:44:53,730 --> 03:44:55,310
They don't give a fuck about content.

4000
03:44:55,670 --> 03:44:56,670
They don't...

4001
03:44:59,290 --> 03:45:01,050
What the fuck do you mean?

4002
03:45:01,990 --> 03:45:03,410
These are Apex Watchers.

4003
03:45:03,910 --> 03:45:06,270
They don't care about what's funny.

4004
03:45:06,550 --> 03:45:08,470
They care about what's cool.

4005
03:45:11,010 --> 03:45:13,110
Wait, no, wait, no, there is big brain.

4006
03:45:13,290 --> 03:45:14,970
Guys, no, I got it.

4007
03:45:15,730 --> 03:45:17,130
This is so big brain.

4008
03:45:17,510 --> 03:45:20,610
Because all the Apex Watchers are going to be split vote.

4009
03:45:21,370 --> 03:45:24,250
They're all going to be split vote because all these clips
are all, like, so cool.

4010
03:45:25,270 --> 03:45:28,130
Wait, no, you guys are actually... You guys are actually
really smart.

4011
03:45:28,730 --> 03:45:29,690
You guys are actually so smart.

4012
03:45:29,810 --> 03:45:30,810
You're splitting all the votes.

4013
03:45:31,010 --> 03:45:33,410
We're splitting all the votes of, like, all the...

4014
03:45:34,610 --> 03:45:42,470
on me fucking all the cool clips so then people who just
wanted to laugh they'll vote for me because they'll laugh at

4015
03:45:42,470 --> 03:45:49,230
me not with me and then so god I don't know if that's the
thing is I don't know if there's enough voters that will

4016
03:45:49,230 --> 03:45:51,070
vote for that I don't know

4017
03:45:55,670 --> 03:46:04,570
the only issue is that I don't know we have enough voters
that will vote for that though so What if there's not

4018
03:46:04,570 --> 03:46:05,530
enough?

4019
03:46:08,810 --> 03:46:10,230
We just need a vote.

4020
03:46:10,550 --> 03:46:11,970
Yeah, that's totally the plan.

4021
03:46:12,310 --> 03:46:13,550
Are they voting for the clips now?

4022
03:46:13,650 --> 03:46:13,970

Okay, I'll send in one more funny clip.

4027
03:46:21,450 --> 03:46:24,710
You'll get the undecided voters.

4028
03:46:25,210 --> 03:46:26,930
That's where we're aiming at right now.

4029
03:46:27,030 --> 03:46:30,310

We're not gonna win the ha-ha clip now.

4064
03:48:48,550 --> 03:48:50,670
We're not gonna win the ha-ha clip.

4065
03:48:52,550 --> 03:48:53,370
It's over.

4066
03:48:53,510 --> 03:48:55,170

03:48:56,050 --> 03:48:57,930

03:49:07,870 --> 03:49:08,210
Alright.

03:49:11,950 --> 03:49:12,890
Okay, alright.

03:49:13,110 --> 03:49:13,910

4074
03:49:13,910 --> 03:49:16,110
I will send one last clip, guys.

4075
03:49:16,130 --> 03:49:17,890
I will send one last clip.

4076
03:49:19,030 --> 03:49:20,090
I'll send one last clip.

4077
03:49:20,270 --> 03:49:21,690
Is there anything that we have?

4078
03:49:22,230 --> 03:49:23,030
That's good.

4079
03:49:23,730 --> 03:49:24,810
Do we have anything?

4080
03:49:25,250 --> 03:49:25,890
We tried.

4081
03:49:26,010 --> 03:49:26,390
It's over.

4082
03:49:26,690 --> 03:49:27,190
Okay, never mind.

4083
03:49:27,370 --> 03:49:28,270
We all gave up.

4084
03:49:29,030 --> 03:49:29,130
All right.

4085
03:49:29,570 --> 03:49:31,190
I'm not gonna wait until...

4086
03:49:31,190 --> 03:49:35,170
I'm not gonna see who got the clips that it's over.

4087
03:49:36,010 --> 03:49:37,430
Introvert clip is still fun.

4088
03:49:37,550 --> 03:49:37,990
Fine.

4089
03:49:38,150 --> 03:49:39,150
I'll do the introvert.

4090
03:49:39,210 --> 03:49:40,950
Wait, are you the one that fucking made that clip?

4091
03:49:41,030 --> 03:49:42,650
Is that why you keep chilling in?

4092
03:49:42,710 --> 03:49:43,230
No, you're not.

4093
03:49:43,430 --> 03:49:44,210
Okay, I'll...

4094
03:49:45,010 --> 03:49:45,550
Fine.

4095
03:49:45,550 --> 03:49:49,610
Now I'll send the introvert clip over.

4096
03:49:54,570 --> 03:49:55,910
All right, I'm going to call it here.

4097
03:49:56,010 --> 03:49:56,850
That was fun, though.

4098
03:49:57,010 --> 03:50:00,110
Okay, for those who don't know, change a schedule.

4099
03:50:00,290 --> 03:50:01,410
I'll post this on Twitter.

4100
03:50:02,130 --> 03:50:05,270
And I'll post this on Twitter later.

4101
03:50:05,650 --> 03:50:08,410
But there has been a change of schedule.

4102
03:50:09,570 --> 03:50:10,310
Oh, shit.

4103
03:50:10,450 --> 03:50:14,550
Okay, so this is the new schedule now.

4104
03:50:15,610 --> 03:50:19,810
We changed it to fit people's, other people's schedule.

4105
03:50:20,410 --> 03:50:25,110
So Resident Evil 4 and Hufobia are both swapped now.

4106
03:50:25,990 --> 03:50:29,810
So over here, tomorrow, it's Hufobia.

4107
03:50:30,570 --> 03:50:32,510
And then for those who are like, what the fuck is Hufobia?

4108
03:50:32,690 --> 03:50:36,590
It's basically like, you play as either a hunter or deers.

4109
03:50:37,190 --> 03:50:40,470
And then the hunter has to, like, try to kill the deers.

4110
03:50:40,610 --> 03:50:41,770
And it's not just, like, three deers.

4111
03:50:41,850 --> 03:50:42,750
There's, like, lots of deers.

4112
03:50:43,090 --> 03:50:45,530
And then the deers have to pretend to be deers.

4113
03:50:45,550 --> 03:50:57,590
and like beat the shit out of the hunter so so like that's
basically it so it's like deers versus hunters um inside you

4114
03:50:57,590 --> 03:51:03,350
are two deers yeah i've been wanting to play that game for a
while but i like there was like no multiplayer but then they

4115
03:51:03,350 --> 03:51:08,970
recently added multiplayer like they recently i mean there
was multiplayer but there's no private servers but they

4116
03:51:08,970 --> 03:51:17,790
recently added private servers now so like i'm looking
forward to it uh so So that's who phobia.

4117
03:51:18,390 --> 03:51:22,630
And then obviously, Resident Evil 4, I saw people asking if
it was the original or the remake.

4118
03:51:23,070 --> 03:51:26,270
I will be playing the remake because I don't want to
restart.

4119
03:51:26,770 --> 03:51:29,050
I don't want to go back from the beginning.

4120
03:51:31,990 --> 03:51:34,190
I don't want to replay the original.

4121
03:51:34,710 --> 03:51:37,150
So we're going to be playing the remake.

4122
03:51:37,830 --> 03:51:40,410
So at least we can finish it this time.

4123
03:51:46,230 --> 03:51:54,490
anyway anyway that is the current schedule hey guys i hope
you guys had a great time um i'm so happy we made it to the

4124
03:51:54,490 --> 03:52:03,930
finals i honestly did not expect us to make it to the finals
and um it's it's hard being the extroverted introvert

4125
03:52:03,930 --> 03:52:14,910
because i tried my best to be social amongst apex streamers
because that is very difficult to do when you are the most

4126
03:52:14,910 --> 03:52:19,010
uh social person there as the introvert so

4127
03:52:23,490 --> 03:52:32,250
so i tried my best anyway uh thank you everybody for coming
as always everybody stay hydrated posture check get up and

4128
03:52:32,250 --> 03:52:38,150
move around to get that blood flowing if you and you said
for me head to bed because you deserve it i'll see you guys

4129
03:52:38,150 --> 03:52:39,690
