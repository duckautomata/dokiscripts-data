1
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:45,930
Where am I?

2
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:47,090
Oh, there I am.

3
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:50,090
Abracadabra, it was a magic trick.

4
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:51,850
I'm actually here.

5
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:54,210
If I sound, guys, dragons.

6
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:56,170
If I sound dead, I'm dead inside.

7
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:58,170
It's because I am.

8
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:01,030
For those who are new here.

9
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:05,410
Every time it's, every time it is...

10
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:09,270
Oh, it's 12.30 stream.

11
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:12,350
I am actually not alive for a while.

12
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:14,290
So, give me a sec.

13
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:15,690
I was debating.

14
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:18,230
I was debating if I should have like...

15
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:20,370
If I drink some gamer subs today.

16
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:22,410
But like, I ran out of like...

17
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:24,150
Water, like water.

18
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:25,690
Bottled water.

19
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:28,350
So like, and like...

20
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:30,350
It sucks because like...

21
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:34,150
There's like construction nearby.

22
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:37,490
So like, it's hard to get stuff delivered.

23
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:39,110
Like get groceries delivered.

24
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:40,770
Right now.

25
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:42,510
So I have to like...

26
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:44,070
I don't want to walk to...

27
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:46,730
I don't want to walk to a grocery store.

28
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,670
And carry back lots of water.

29
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:50,150
Um, I don't...

30
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:52,070
Guys, okay, like, it's like PTSD.

31
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:54,130
But I don't trust tap water.

32
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:55,330
No matter where I live.

33
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:59,290
Because like, my parents instilled the whole...

34
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:00,210
Never drink tap water.

35
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:01,030
You'll fucking die.

36
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:02,790
Like...

37
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:06,670
So...

38
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:08,910
So like, I...

39
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:10,930
I don't drink tap water.

40
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:12,890
And um...

41
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:15,670
And um...

42
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:16,610
Um, I...

43
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:18,290
I boil water now.

44
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:20,150
I do have a kettle, so I boil water.

45
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:22,910
And uh, the thing is...

46
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:24,970
Gamersubs...

47
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:28,610
I like to drink cold Gamersubs water.

48
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:32,490
So like, you know, when you mix Gamersubs with water together...

49
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:33,850
It doesn't taste very well.

50
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:35,650
Especially because it's a powdered drink.

51
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:37,550
It tastes very well when it's hot.

52
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:39,410
So like, this morning...

53
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:40,630
I boiled water yesterday.

54
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:43,850
And then, so I was like, yeah, tomorrow...

55
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:45,790
Tomorrow, I'm gonna...

56
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:48,010
I'm gonna fucking use that water...

57
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:49,070
When it cools down.

58
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:51,670
To um...

59
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:54,030
To make some Gamersubs stuff.

60
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:55,210
So...

61
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:57,450
So I'm not tired as fuck today.

62
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:59,430
Um, and then I woke up.

63
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:01,290
And then I boiled the water again.

64
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:03,390
Because I forgot!

65
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:03,770
I forgot!

66
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:05,810
I forgot the plan!

67
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:08,470
I was just like, alright.

68
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:10,550
I woke up and I was like, oh shit.

69
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:12,290
I should make some hot water.

70
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:14,230
This water's cold now.

71
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:14,850
Oh!

72
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:21,090
So like...

73
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:23,150
Now I don't get water.

74
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:29,290
I still have some of my water from yesterday.

75
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:31,510
Some water I had yesterday.

76
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:33,150
Right now in my tumbler.

77
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:35,410
Um, but...

78
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:37,710
Um, it has a tea bag in it.

79
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:39,890
So I can't mix that with Gamersubs.

80
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:40,930
Because I'm afraid...

81
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:42,370
I'm scared of what...

82
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:45,750
I'm scared of what will happen to me if I do that.

83
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:46,970
Because I don't think that's healthy.

84
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:50,770
If I mix tea caffeine with Gamersubs caffeine.

85
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:52,110
So like...

86
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:53,250
I'm afraid of my heart.

87
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:54,010
Uh...

88
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:57,050
That's a...

89
00:04:57,050 --> 00:04:57,630
Deadpool.

90
00:04:58,050 --> 00:04:59,210
Thank you for the super chat.

91
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:00,310
Thank you, thank you.

92
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:01,450
Careful, Doki.

93
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:05,290
There are chemicals in the water that's turning the VTubers straight.

94
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:06,710
Thank you for the super chat.

95
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:07,830
Thank you, thank you.

96
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:09,810
Um, anyway.

97
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:12,030
It's like how people would mix like...

98
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:13,190
No, I did that before.

99
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:15,850
Okay, so I talked about this story before.

100
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:16,970
But, oh my god.

101
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:19,330
I even talk so slow because my brain is so tired.

102
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:21,810
Um, I got seven hours of sleep.

103
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:24,350
But I think I woke up at a bad REM cycle.

104
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:25,650
Uh, anyway.

105
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:28,130
So, when I was in university.

106
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:31,210
Um, I was...

107
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:31,870
I...

108
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:34,070
I did not care about my health.

109
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:36,090
In a way where like...

110
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:37,650
I have exam tomorrow.

111
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:39,950
Um, oh fuck.

112
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:41,650
I gotta cram...

113
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:43,950
60% of the information.

114
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:45,990
Right now.

115
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:48,850
And then I would mix...

116
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:49,890
This...

117
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:51,590
Five hour energy drinks.

118
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:52,590
The five...

119
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:54,510
I would just drink the five hour energy.

120
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:55,830
The little tiny ones.

121
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:57,350
The five hour energy.

122
00:05:59,370 --> 00:05:59,970
Plus...

123
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:02,690
Um, plus a...

124
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:04,490
Um...

125
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:06,430
A one shot...

126
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:08,050
One shot espresso cans.

127
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:10,210
And...

128
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:11,350
A...

129
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:13,670
Like a rockstar energy drink.

130
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:15,530
Just so I could like survive.

131
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:17,010
Like I would like not sleep.

132
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:19,030
So I could pull an all nighter.

133
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:21,150
And um...

134
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:21,910
Yeah, no.

135
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:23,570
I don't know how.

136
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:26,370
And then like after...

137
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:29,470
Like after, you know, the exams were over.

138
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:30,350
I cried.

139
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:31,550
Because I was...

140
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:34,470
I was just like...

141
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,970
And I also did that because...

142
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:44,690
I had to rewrite a paper.

143
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:45,850
I had to do that.

144
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:46,770
Because I was due tomorrow.

145
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,010
And then, um...

146
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:51,050
I also drank a five hour energy drink.

147
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:52,310
And also a rockstar.

148
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:53,530
Because like...

149
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:55,710
I would drink the five hour energy drink.

150
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:57,110
And I would be like, I'm so tired.

151
00:06:57,410 --> 00:06:59,270
So now I would chug a rockstar.

152
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:03,470
Because I had to stay awake to rewrite my entire paper within a day.

153
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:05,630
Because I would...

154
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:06,890
I hired like...

155
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:07,670
I would not hire.

156
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:09,070
But like, um...

157
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:10,770
I had like a...

158
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:12,910
A professor.

159
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:15,190
From another university.

160
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:16,830
That would read my paper.

161
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:18,730
And tell me if it's good or not.

162
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:20,230
And like, she would edit it and stuff.

163
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:23,030
Like, she would edit it and proofread it for me.

164
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:24,210
Because I was that...

165
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:24,930
I was that...

166
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:27,610
I was that fucking...

167
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:29,110
Studious.

168
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:31,550
That really wanted a really good grade.

169
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:34,170
So then, you know, when you hire like...

170
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:35,290
Peer review...

171
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:36,090
Peer reviewers.

172
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:41,090
To read your paper to make sure it's a good paper.

173
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:42,970
Um...

174
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:45,210
The professor...

175
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:46,690
Uh, came back.

176
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:49,750
And was like, this is a really bad paper.

177
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:55,350
LAUGHS LAUGHS LAUGHS I was like, what do I do?

178
00:07:57,490 --> 00:07:58,890
She was like...

179
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:00,050
This is not a good paper.

180
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:02,810
Like, you gotta change half of this.

181
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:04,730
And then, I was like...

182
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:05,070
What?

183
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:08,150
LAUGHS I was just like, what?

184
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:11,770
No, she would do really well for other stuff.

185
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:13,470
Like, I really liked her.

186
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:15,550
Because she actually helped me get really good grades.

187
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,830
But then, this was the first time she was like...

188
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,150
No, this paper is really bad.

189
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:20,430
You gotta rewrite half of this.

190
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:22,170
And I was just like, what?

191
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:24,270
But it's due tomorrow.

192
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:26,310
It's due tomorrow.

193
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:28,290
And she was like, well, obviously.

194
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:29,750
She was like, I don't have time to read this.

195
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:32,070
Reread your edits at the end of the year.

196
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:34,690
Um...

197
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:35,810
It's due tomorrow.

198
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:38,290
But you gotta change this and that and that.

199
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:39,870
And I was just like...

200
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:41,690
I can't sleep.

201
00:08:42,410 --> 00:08:44,190
This paper took me...

202
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,710
One month to write.

203
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:48,270
And now I have to rewrite this entire thing.

204
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:49,090
Within a day.

205
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:51,490
Rewrite half of this in a day.

206
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:53,470
So...

207
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:57,250
Yeah, so I chugged down a five hour energy.

208
00:08:57,590 --> 00:09:00,270
And then a rockstar energy drink.

209
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:01,950
And I was just like...

210
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,830
And then in the middle of writing this...

211
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:05,770
I had a breakdown.

212
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:06,910
Because, you know...

213
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:08,290
I mixed those two drinks together.

214
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:10,390
I was so fucking tired.

215
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:11,870
I was just like...

216
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:19,730
Guys, AI did not exist back then.

217
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:20,890
When I was in university.

218
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:23,670
These kids have it so good right now.

219
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:24,890
And so I was just like...

220
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:28,250
So I had like a...

221
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:29,810
A mini breakdown.

222
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:32,410
While I was like...

223
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:33,850
In one of those hours.

224
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:36,630
Because I was so fucking done.

225
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:37,870
Um...

226
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:39,850
No, they shouldn't use it.

227
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:41,770
Yeah, but like...

228
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:43,290
They're not gonna stop.

229
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:47,030
University students will always take the easiest way out.

230
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:47,590
If they can.

231
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:49,710
Because I would know.

232
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:51,210
Because I was a university student.

233
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:51,970
If I knew...

234
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:54,150
If I had chat GPT.

235
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:56,030
I wouldn't use it to copy it.

236
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:57,330
I would use it for research.

237
00:09:57,490 --> 00:09:59,550
Just to start the research.

238
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:01,290
And now I use Google Scholar.

239
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:04,770
Just to figure out where to go.

240
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:07,110
But a lot of people just copy and paste.

241
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:09,750
So now like professors now...

242
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:12,070
Professors now are like...

243
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:13,470
Being trained...

244
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:15,350
To how to spot AI.

245
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:16,390
Uh...

246
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:19,630
So...

247
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:20,630
Um...

248
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:21,990
It's actually really weird.

249
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:25,570
Because professors are not trained to grade papers anymore.

250
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:27,530
They're trained to like...

251
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:30,810
Figure out if this paper is written by AI or not.

252
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:32,050
Which I don't know.

253
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:33,190
I just think that's like...

254
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:34,550
It's just so fucking weird.

255
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:37,110
That that's what their whole job is now.

256
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:38,170
Just to be like...

257
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:39,370
Did this person use AI?

258
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:43,490
Um...

259
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:45,250
Anton, thank you for the super chat.

260
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:46,290
Thank you, thank you.

261
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:48,970
Gamersubs used vitamin B12 for it's big energy boost.

262
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:50,630
Which passes right through you harmlessly.

263
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:53,750
And excess to Gamersub tea elixir won't destroy you.

264
00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:55,250
Anton, thank you for the super chat.

265
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:56,290
Thank you, thank you.

266
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:57,990
Yeah, so...

267
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:00,730
I could use my tea to mix it with Gamersubs.

268
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:02,730
But then would it taste...

269
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:04,670
I'm fucked up with that taste though.

270
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:06,850
Because my tea bag is like...

271
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:08,970
Honey lemon flavor for my throat.

272
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:12,170
Hmm...

273
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:13,710
So like...

274
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:14,950
I have no idea.

275
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:16,870
I have no idea if it's gonna...

276
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:19,870
Taste wise, it might be fucked up too.

277
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:20,910
Um...

278
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:22,210
Thank you for the super chat.

279
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:23,110
Thank you, thank you.

280
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:28,390
Thank you for the super chat.

281
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:29,750
Thank you, thank you.

282
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:32,630
Oh my god.

283
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:33,010
Okay.

284
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:34,890
Oh god.

285
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,620
Oh my god.

286
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:41,240
I don't know why.

287
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,120
I don't know why.

288
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,060
Past Doki was like...

289
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:45,880
Don't worry guys.

290
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:49,300
Next week Doki is gonna finish this game.

291
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,200
Did it this week.

292
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,180
I'm gonna finish this game next week.

293
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,800
And then today is...

294
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,520
Today is next week Doki.

295
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,500
And then I looked at...

296
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,140
How much I had to do left.

297
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:03,400
And okay, I'm gonna look at it again.

298
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:05,520
I just remember when I first looked at it.

299
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:06,760
I was just like...

300
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,280
Wait, that's a lot more than I thought.

301
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,060
Like...

302
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,700
I was like, wait a minute.

303
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:13,840
Oh my god, wait a minute.

304
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,520
I thought...

305
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,960
I thought...

306
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,740
I thought I had like...

307
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:22,560
Almost...

308
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,800
I was almost done.

309
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,280
Alright, where am I?

310
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,100
Okay, so let's see.

311
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:30,380
I am at the labyrinth, right?

312
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:32,160
I'm at the labyrinth now.

313
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:34,280
So...

314
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,100
Am I at the labyrinth?

315
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:37,600
Or am I at a prison?

316
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:38,740
No, I'm in the labyrinth.

317
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,380
I just started the labyrinth.

318
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,580
Okay, I'm in the labyrinth.

319
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:43,440
This guy...

320
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,020
Okay, I have...

321
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:48,120
9, 10, 1, 2, 3...

322
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,720
Okay, this guy finished this game in 3 hours.

323
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,560
That would be like 5...

324
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,600
That would be 5 or 6 hours for me.

325
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,320
So like...

326
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,000
Oh my god.

327
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,080
Oh!

328
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:03,900
Okay.

329
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:05,460
Okay.

330
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:06,500
6 hours, alright.

331
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:08,480
Here we go.

332
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,980
Sorry guys, my brain is still waking up right now.

333
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,420
At the moment, so...

334
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:14,260
I'm like super fatigued too.

335
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,140
Oh my god, also...

336
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:18,520
That update, Doki Emerdoja update.

337
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:21,220
Um, it's a little sad update.

338
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,080
Because like...

339
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,380
Okay, now you guys are like...

340
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:24,740
NO, WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM?!

341
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:26,620
Okay, no, it was more so like...

342
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:28,260
I was walking him yesterday and it was raining.

343
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,280
So there's like puddles and everything.

344
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,880
And then like...

345
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:36,020
So like, you know, there's cars driving by.

346
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:38,200
So I was like, I was like...

347
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:38,980
Doki, no.

348
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:41,920
Because he was like, I WANNA CROSS THE ROAD!

349
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:42,660
I WANNA CROSS THE ROAD!

350
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:45,040
And I was like, no, there's a giant puddle, come back.

351
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,780
But he didn't care and I kept pulling him.

352
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:47,720
And I was like, NO!

353
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,060
I WANNA CROSS THE ROAD!

354
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,380
I WANNA BE CLOSER TO THE ROAD!

355
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,300
And the car fucking...

356
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:54,800
And then, you know like...

357
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,620
In movies where like...

358
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:59,460
Water would just like splash on the road and stuff.

359
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:01,440
It would just happen in movies and it was like a giant water splash.

360
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:02,860
Well, it wasn't in the movies.

361
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,560
But it actually happened.

362
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,820
And so like, he was like drenched in water.

363
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:09,920
And he was like...

364
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,860
And he backed off instantly.

365
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,300
But then obviously, he still got drenched.

366
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:15,500
But then he looked at me.

367
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:17,020
And he was like, you let this happen?

368
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:18,580
I was like, what the fuck do you mean?

369
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:21,540
He looked at me, he was just like...

370
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:23,560
HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!

371
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:24,880
HAHAHAHAHA!

372
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,880
I was like, you pulled...

373
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:29,430
TRIQuiter!

374
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:51,550
No, of course I didn't get drenched I was away from the fucking road I was like not, like he likes to be like super close to the road because he wants to be he was like I want To cross, I want to cross, I want to cross the road, I want to cross And I'm like I saw the giant puddle so I was like no,

375
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:55,070
do not get close to the road because the car is gonna fucking go

376
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:02,690
And then after he got splashed, he just looks at me and is like, you did this.

377
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:05,550
You did this to me.

378
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:06,750
I'm like, no, I did not.

379
00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:09,450
You did this to your fucking self, you fucking idiot.

380
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:15,590
I pulled, I pulled on the fucking, I pulled on the leash.

381
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:17,730
I gave him a warning.

382
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:20,950
I pulled on the leash, but he wouldn't listen.

383
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:23,210
Anyway guys, it's silent.

384
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:25,570
Silent hill time.

385
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:28,670
Mother, why didn't you warn me?

386
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:29,710
Oh, I'm sorry.

387
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:30,390
I'm sorry.

388
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:32,410
I can't fucking speak, dog.

389
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:36,090
All right.

390
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:37,950
It's time.

391
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:38,810
Oh my god.

392
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:41,210
Sorry, I need to like hype myself up because I'm already tired.

393
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:42,380
It's time!

394
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:44,990
My brain needs to wake up.

395
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:47,840
Why did you not protect me?

396
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:55,370
All right, here we go.

397
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:58,430
Where am I?

398
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:02,030
Oh my god, why do I keep, oh, I remember why I was stopped here.

399
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:03,870
No, I remember now.

400
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:06,730
I remember why I stopped here.

401
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:11,410
This is where I saw the spider legs and I was like, I'm done.

402
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:16,150
I saw the spider legs and I was like, fuck this shit.

403
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:19,110
Fuck the spider legs.

404
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:22,310
Don't fuck, I know, don't fuck the spider legs, guys.

405
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:22,750
I know.

406
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:25,470
I know the spider legs, though.

407
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:31,110
They are very leggy, but don't fuck them.

408
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:35,630
All right, we went that way already, so we gotta go straight.

409
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:41,210
Nice,

410
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,020
okay, there's meds.

411
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:53,600
Oh my god, guys, do you think 20 is enough, guys?

412
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:54,940
Do you think?

413
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:01,140
Oh my god, I think this game is trying to tell me I do not need to take my meds.

414
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,720
I don't need to.

415
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,060
I just don't want to hear the voices.

416
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,140
If I take them, the voices will be gone.

417
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:14,640
Where have I not gone to?

418
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:17,060
Oh, it was here.

419
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:24,640
Wait, how do I get over here?

420
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:25,460
Do I just hit it?

421
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,340
Wait, what?

422
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:33,060
How do I get across?

423
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:34,900
Oh, I guess like here?

424
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,760
No, this door is locked.

425
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:45,960
So confused.

426
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:48,680
Oh, I haven't gone here.

427
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:48,780
Okay.

428
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:54,920
Oh, no.

429
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,520
Why is it so quiet and dark?

430
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:03,120
It's like Silent Hill is like silent.

431
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:06,140
Who would have thought?

432
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:12,080
Who would have thought that Silent in Silent Hill means actually silent?

433
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,720
It's crazy.

434
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,700
What the fuck?

435
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:23,940
Alright.

436
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:25,440
Oh, I missed.

437
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:27,040
Alright,

438
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,540
didn't miss that.

439
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:32,520
Let's get down.

440
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,660
Like, he just looked at me.

441
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:36,080
Like, what?

442
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:38,880
I was just like, oh, hey there.

443
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:50,320
Hey, I didn't say that.

444
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:50,820
Wait a minute.

445
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:51,660
Wait a minute.

446
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:52,740
I don't remember that.

447
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,760
He was also still waking up.

448
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:58,920
Bro, I understand, man.

449
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:03,380
Bro, I understand, bro.

450
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:05,600
Okay.

451
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,700
Go this way.

452
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:15,860
Alright,

453
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:21,400
let's go.

454
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:26,800
Oh my god, did I really say that?

455
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:29,480
I fucking hate Pastor Oki.

456
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:30,560
I hate her.

457
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,840
I hate her so much.

458
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,760
Why would she do this to me?

459
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,740
Okay, nice.

460
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:43,780
Why would she do this to me?

461
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,840
Oh my god.

462
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:50,840
I've been playing this game for 20 years.

463
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:54,520
My dragons have gotten married and have kids and I'm still...

464
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:59,080
But I'm still here trying to play this stupid game!

465
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,220
Get down!

466
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:04,960
They have kids now!

467
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:08,020
It's been 20 Halloweens!

468
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:12,220
Okay, we go this way.

469
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:14,660
Oh no, I hear them.

470
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:17,300
Oh, I hear them.

471
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,380
I hate this.

472
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:29,700
Oh my god, I hear the spiders.

473
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,500
I hear the spiders.

474
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:36,700
I'm never gonna leave this godforsaken lands.

475
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:41,290
Is this bait?

476
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:42,690
Is this bait?

477
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:48,630
Oh my god, why is there ammo in the middle of the... in the middle?

478
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:51,390
It feels like bait.

479
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:55,860
Smash.

480
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:59,480
Okay, here we go.

481
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,820
Okay, that can't be that bad, right?

482
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,400
Anton, thank you for the superchat.

483
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,160
Thank you, thank you.

484
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,020
On October 11th...

485
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,180
Wait, why won't it let me go up?

486
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:15,500
Okay.

487
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:24,000
You declared Double or Nothing Top 500 in Overwatch 2 Season 13, which ends December 10, 2024, or suffer a penalty chosen by...

488
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:24,580
Oh no.

489
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,100
Wait, what date is it right now?

490
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:27,880
Wait.

491
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:30,360
Oh fuck, okay.

492
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:32,860
Oh no, those are pyramid head slashes.

493
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,160
Wait, I just noticed that.

494
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,000
Wait, that's only from Pyramid.

495
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,760
Oh no, wait, what date?

496
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,300
Oh, guys.

497
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:44,160
Guys, I'm only... I'm only Masters 2, guys.

498
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:54,040
Guys, I got to Masters 2 and then I stopped for two weeks because I got busy.

499
00:21:58,100 --> 00:21:59,640
What the fuck?

500
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:02,160
Of course!

501
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:03,900
Of course it's the spider.

502
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:08,420
I was like, I was trying to read the map.

503
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,980
Thank you for the superchat, thank you, thank you.

504
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:19,300
Yes.

505
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,820
I guess I go this way?

506
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:24,460
Yeah, ammo.

507
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:27,320
I knew it.

508
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,480
I knew this was going to happen.

509
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:30,060
I knew this was going to happen.

510
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,460
I was like, they're going to pop by.

511
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,940
I fucking knew it.

512
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,440
Like, all those ammo bait...

513
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,100
Led to this moment.

514
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,580
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

515
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:51,160
I'm looking up.

516
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:55,120
Gamers, gamers, don't look up!

517
00:22:58,420 --> 00:22:59,400
I knew it!

518
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:03,560
Fuck, oh shit, he still got me!

519
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:04,980
He

520
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:11,750
fucking kicked me in the shins!

521
00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:17,130
The fucker kicked me in the goddamn shins!

522
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:20,230
Oh, alright.

523
00:23:20,370 --> 00:23:22,250
You know, I think I'm making pretty good progress though.

524
00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:24,450
Yeah, yep.

525
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:29,450
Honestly, I'm zooming.

526
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:36,020
Katis, thank you for the superchat, thank you, thank you.

527
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:39,500
I already got my first scientific publication posted.

528
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:45,200
Before Doki finishes Silent Hill, guys, at least GTA...

529
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:45,580
What?

530
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:47,220
Get back here!

531
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:49,620
Get your ass back here!

532
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:52,700
Go get your ass back here!

533
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:54,920
Bro, get over here!

534
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:55,720
Oh, okay.

535
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:58,220
Okay, now you wanna fight.

536
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:02,980
Nice.

537
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,720
Making my way downtown, walking fast.

538
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:09,500
What the fuck?

539
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:12,860
Oh, now you wanna walk back, okay.

540
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:14,120
Oh shit, I'm sorry.

541
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:16,360
Ow!

542
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:17,500
Wait, did I dodge it?

543
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:18,080
I can't tell!

544
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:19,300
I can't tell!

545
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:21,720
There's so many things happening on my screen!

546
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:24,420
Fine.

547
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:28,280
Okay.

548
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:31,160
Oh, there's another hole in the wall.

549
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:33,420
You know what that means, it's our favorite time of the year!

550
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:35,860
Gotta stick my hand through it.

551
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:37,140
Oh, there's a key.

552
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:40,220
Wait, when was the thing locked?

553
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,140
Not a good!

554
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:45,140
Thank you for the super chat!

555
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,100
Thank you, thank you!

556
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,100
Wait, where's this?

557
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:52,630
I don't remember this part.

558
00:24:54,330 --> 00:24:54,810
Oh well.

559
00:24:55,930 --> 00:24:57,530
It's a shortcut for something.

560
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:01,550
These photos you've been collecting... actually, do you spell out?

561
00:25:01,650 --> 00:25:04,230
You've been here for two... I knew it, I fucking knew it.

562
00:25:04,890 --> 00:25:06,610
I knew I've been here forever.

563
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:10,740
Alright.

564
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:15,680
A million VTubers have already finished this game and I'm still here.

565
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:19,500
They've finished it.

566
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,600
Wait, where do I go?

567
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:23,740
What was locked?

568
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:31,980
Where the fuck do I... which way?

569
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:35,220
Okay, one, two, or three.

570
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:37,220
I'm so confused.

571
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:43,920
I can't read maps, guys.

572
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:48,360
I don't remember where goes where.

573
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:52,760
Just one?

574
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:56,000
Where did I come from?

575
00:25:57,540 --> 00:25:59,060
Did I come from a bird?

576
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:01,360
Okay, wait.

577
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:02,660
No, that makes sense.

578
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:03,220
No, I did.

579
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:04,960
So I'm a doki bird.

580
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:07,460
Here?

581
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:10,460
Oh, this!

582
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:16,080
Alright.

583
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:17,140
Easy.

584
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:20,960
Alright, up we go.

585
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,080
Jk, I can't... Oh!

586
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,420
Oh, come on!

587
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:29,840
Get over here!

588
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:30,960
Get down!

589
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:34,880
Stupid...

590
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:36,960
Stupid spider.

591
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:40,680
That's how you waste my fucking bullets!

592
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:43,260
Oh, I do not have a lot left.

593
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:44,600
I have like 13.

594
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:50,500
Who keeps repopulating the spider population?

595
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:54,620
I fucking knew it.

596
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:55,420
I looked up.

597
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:56,240
I knew it.

598
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:57,240
I knew it.

599
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:00,240
I was like, there's no way they would just let me... that would be too easy.

600
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:02,000
That would be too fucking easy.

601
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:03,260
Who keeps fucking the legs?!

602
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,140
They're just legs!

603
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:11,340
That's the best part.

604
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,040
Okay.

605
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:19,780
Okay.

606
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:20,560
Alright, that's fine.

607
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:21,480
That's fine.

608
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:23,380
We have 10 bullets left.

609
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:30,280
Oh, thank you for the super chat!

610
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:31,460
Thank you, thank you!

611
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:36,430
Please, please guys.

612
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:38,590
Stop banging the legs.

613
00:27:39,170 --> 00:27:41,750
We gotta get... they're an invasive species.

614
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:45,490
They're gonna turn like into the iguanas in Florida!

615
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:50,030
Where am I?

616
00:27:50,390 --> 00:27:51,390
Oh, there's ammo.

617
00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:54,210
Are you serious?

618
00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:55,650
They're all just rifle ammos.

619
00:27:55,770 --> 00:27:57,410
I need pistols!

620
00:28:00,770 --> 00:28:02,770
Guys, they're invasive species!

621
00:28:03,050 --> 00:28:04,310
Stop creating more!

622
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,280
Okay, now we're at four.

623
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:15,460
The fuck is four?

624
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,340
Okay, we got the shortcut here.

625
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,560
Alright, I go forward.

626
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,340
Okay, under.

627
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:35,940
That's like... what?

628
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:38,640
Oh my god, it's not a safe spot.

629
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:41,520
Oh, oh, oh!

630
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:43,400
Oh, okay.

631
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:44,780
Can't go back now.

632
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:48,260
Hello?

633
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,540
No items?

634
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,820
What's that supposed to mean?

635
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:55,480
What?

636
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,280
I don't...

637
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:07,240
Oh, this way.

638
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:08,820
There's another hole.

639
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,540
I was getting a little angry.

640
00:29:17,610 --> 00:29:18,210
This...

641
00:29:18,210 --> 00:29:20,450
I'm gonna get like a wire cutter, I think.

642
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:24,850
Oh, there's way too many holes.

643
00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:27,570
Which hole is the right hole?

644
00:29:29,210 --> 00:29:31,330
Which hole is the right hole?

645
00:29:41,950 --> 00:29:42,730
Oh.

646
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:44,330
Oh shit, no, not again.

647
00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:45,970
No, not again.

648
00:29:48,530 --> 00:29:49,310
Okay.

649
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:52,530
James?

650
00:29:53,330 --> 00:29:54,030
That's me.

651
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:59,630
Oh my

652
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:03,940
god, that is me!

653
00:30:09,010 --> 00:30:10,030
That's me!

654
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:12,550
Hello?

655
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:23,010
Wait, is he gonna come in?

656
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:35,390
Oh my god, oh my god!

657
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:37,550
They can't come in!

658
00:30:37,890 --> 00:30:39,850
I was like, I'm in a red room.

659
00:30:40,910 --> 00:30:42,190
That's safe.

660
00:30:42,930 --> 00:30:44,490
Does he climb ladders?

661
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:45,830
Okay, hello.

662
00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:50,090
You can't get me!

663
00:30:53,090 --> 00:30:57,250
Look at that, you might be able to open doors.

664
00:30:57,850 --> 00:31:00,690
But you can't go through here.

665
00:31:01,870 --> 00:31:03,090
You know what?

666
00:31:04,290 --> 00:31:05,390
You know what?

667
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:06,970
I'm gonna shoot you in the leg.

668
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:08,390
That's fucking right.

669
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:09,290
Boom!

670
00:31:09,810 --> 00:31:11,590
What you gonna do?

671
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:12,810
Nothing!

672
00:31:13,930 --> 00:31:14,810
That's right!

673
00:31:15,150 --> 00:31:17,430
You might have a poseable thus!

674
00:31:17,650 --> 00:31:20,370
But what can you do about steel bars?

675
00:31:21,650 --> 00:31:22,930
Okay, let's go up.

676
00:31:30,890 --> 00:31:32,110
Alright, here we go.

677
00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:34,830
Okay, that was a little freaky.

678
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:36,870
I was like, I'm in a red room.

679
00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:40,210
That means safe, right?

680
00:31:41,270 --> 00:31:45,070
That's what the game has taught me this entire time, you know?

681
00:31:45,090 --> 00:31:48,090
When you're in a red room and...

682
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:49,650
Woah!

683
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:58,300
You know, when they've taught me this entire time.

684
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:07,400
You would think that it means safe.

685
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:11,960
There we go.

686
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:14,780
I killed 75 enemies.

687
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:19,040
Oh, that's what I thought.

688
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:19,240
Alright.

689
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:24,280
All the safe points were red!

690
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:27,640
So I thought red equals safe!

691
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:30,580
It was this game's yellow!

692
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:35,740
Okay.

693
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:40,280
Now I know not all reds are safe.

694
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:42,820
Where the fuck am I?

695
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,960
Why would red be the new yellow?

696
00:32:57,460 --> 00:32:58,800
Okay, I got syringes.

697
00:32:58,920 --> 00:32:59,240
Nice.

698
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:02,400
Oh nice, I got the pliers.

699
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:08,800
I assume that's the shortcut, right?

700
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:17,230
Okay.

701
00:33:18,010 --> 00:33:18,490
Alright.

702
00:33:18,990 --> 00:33:21,750
I wanna go to- I haven't went to the other end, though.

703
00:33:23,610 --> 00:33:25,430
Might be something at the other end.

704
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:30,240
Oh, oh nice!

705
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:32,940
Nice!

706
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:35,000
Oh thank god, handgun.

707
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:36,720
Oh my god, five bullets!

708
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:38,260
Oh my god, it's Christmas!

709
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:39,440
James!

710
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,380
Merry Christmas, James Thatcher!

711
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:43,220
You've been a good boy today!

712
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:49,420
Other than being a fucking sexual pervert, you've been a very good boy, so here's five bullets!

713
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:50,640
Yippee!

714
00:33:58,050 --> 00:33:58,610
Alright.

715
00:34:00,370 --> 00:34:01,490
Where's the wire?

716
00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:01,570
Okay.

717
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:08,260
I don't

718
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:14,980
remember where anything is in this fucking world.

719
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:22,140
This world is so- Oh my god, where do I go in this fucking world?

720
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:27,080
I'm gonna go save.

721
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:31,540
See?

722
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:32,360
Red!

723
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:34,180
Red!

724
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:36,720
Alright.

725
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:41,020
Oh.

726
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:44,640
Oh, I- get there.

727
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:49,340
Cause I need to get to this side.

728
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:51,620
But how?

729
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:55,180
Oh my god, oh my fucking god.

730
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:57,780
Okay.

731
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,800
I assume... two?

732
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,520
I need to do like- I need to do like a little loop-de-loop here.

733
00:35:10,570 --> 00:35:11,050
Okay.

734
00:35:14,130 --> 00:35:14,610
Two.

735
00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:17,370
Oh, I'm so fucking lost.

736
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:17,750
Two.

737
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:21,010
Okay, we gotta go to two, and then...

738
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:34,160
And then we go downstairs, and we have to hit the one, and then go to four!

739
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:35,800
Or is that five?

740
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:36,560
No, that's four.

741
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:43,080
Oh wait, the tunnel did collapse.

742
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:44,880
Wait, you're right.

743
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:46,980
Wait.

744
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:50,840
Wait, you're right, the tunnel collapsed.

745
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:58,620
No, you're right.

746
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:01,440
I have to go all the way around.

747
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,320
I forgot about that.

748
00:36:11,490 --> 00:36:12,490
Oh no.

749
00:36:15,110 --> 00:36:18,110
Does that mean I have to go all the way back?

750
00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:23,970
Wait, really?

751
00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:26,810
Wait.

752
00:36:27,910 --> 00:36:29,090
No, there's no way.

753
00:36:29,970 --> 00:36:32,150
There's no way it would do that to me.

754
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:33,310
No.

755
00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:37,650
No, there's no way.

756
00:36:38,330 --> 00:36:39,950
No, I can go through here.

757
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,060
No, there's no way.

758
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:50,580
Yeah, guys, there's no way.

759
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:03,940
Okay.

760
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:06,080
This is it.

761
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:09,360
No, no, I knew it.

762
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,340
I knew it, I remember I made a hole.

763
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:16,300
Okay.

764
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:18,280
And then the wires.

765
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:23,660
How the fuck am I- What?

766
00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:29,730
How do I get there?

767
00:37:36,930 --> 00:37:38,650
Oh, this is where it collapsed.

768
00:37:54,670 --> 00:37:55,110
No.

769
00:37:56,950 --> 00:37:57,390
No.

770
00:37:58,190 --> 00:37:59,410
I have to go back.

771
00:38:00,650 --> 00:38:02,610
I actually have to go back.

772
00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:04,350
No.

773
00:38:05,570 --> 00:38:06,850
No.

774
00:38:10,210 --> 00:38:14,530
I made fun of him too.

775
00:38:17,590 --> 00:38:19,570
Oh no.

776
00:38:26,590 --> 00:38:28,510
I'm so sorry.

777
00:38:29,590 --> 00:38:31,630
I didn't mean it.

778
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:34,490
I didn't mean to shoot you in the foot.

779
00:38:37,530 --> 00:38:39,710
I swear it was an accident.

780
00:38:40,070 --> 00:38:43,130
I swear, Mr. Pyramid Head.

781
00:38:43,810 --> 00:38:45,230
It was an accident.

782
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:47,370
I swear to God.

783
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:56,730
My hand slipped.

784
00:38:57,030 --> 00:38:58,690
I- My hand slipped.

785
00:38:59,310 --> 00:39:00,810
I'm sorry, sir.

786
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:08,290
Okay, I have to do this way and then like- Wait, what?

787
00:39:10,810 --> 00:39:11,830
Wait, what?

788
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:13,170
He's back?

789
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:16,610
Who fucking fucked another spider?

790
00:39:21,270 --> 00:39:24,410
How do you- There's still more of you!

791
00:39:26,830 --> 00:39:33,110
Okay, we gotta go this way back because I have to- Where's the hole?

792
00:39:35,770 --> 00:39:36,810
There it is.

793
00:39:36,910 --> 00:39:38,070
Because I had to go through this hole.

794
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:44,700
No, we have an invasive species problem!

795
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:46,860
You guys gotta stop!

796
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:49,780
Okay, now I'm here.

797
00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:56,700
Okay.

798
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:58,980
I can do this.

799
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:03,020
Okay, I can do this.

800
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:05,840
I can do this.

801
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,880
I can do this.

802
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:15,860
What's the point of- What the fuck was the point of like- Having a shortcut here?

803
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:18,860
That shortcut is actually so bait.

804
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:23,640
That was such a bait shortcut.

805
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:30,740
Oh my God.

806
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:32,860
He's gone.

807
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:38,420
I don't like that he's gone.

808
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:39,500
Where did he go?

809
00:40:40,350 --> 00:40:41,940
Where the fuck did he go?

810
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:48,000
Oh no.

811
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:50,900
I'm sorry for shooting your foot.

812
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:53,880
I'm so sorry.

813
00:40:59,170 --> 00:41:00,380
Where did he go?

814
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:05,360
Where did he go?

815
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:16,560
Because I- I don't know where he went.

816
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:18,940
I don't know where he went.

817
00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:22,900
No way he went to lunch, right?

818
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:24,180
There's no way.

819
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:26,240
Where did he go?

820
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:30,940
He was there the whole time and now he's not?!

821
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:32,160
Okay.

822
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:36,760
Okay, I need to go in a straight and then cut wires.

823
00:41:40,670 --> 00:41:41,270
Alright.

824
00:41:42,090 --> 00:41:42,690
Stardew.

825
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:49,460
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

826
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:03,420
I'm not looking back.

827
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:05,460
If I don't look back, they don't exist.

828
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:08,540
If I don't look back, they don't exist.

829
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:11,380
Okay, here we go.

830
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:15,760
Made it.

831
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:19,020
Why is it red?

832
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:23,480
Okay, down we go.

833
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,460
Night, thank you for the super chat.

834
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:28,180
Thank you, thank you.

835
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:28,860
Silent Hill?

836
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,760
That hill is really loud.

837
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:35,180
It's silent when I wish it wasn't silent though.

838
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:37,540
Please stop giving me meds.

839
00:42:38,060 --> 00:42:38,420
Please.

840
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:39,600
Please.

841
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:40,860
I swear.

842
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:44,780
Please, I can't.

843
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:47,840
I want to hear the voices.

844
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:51,220
Hold time.

845
00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:52,440
Yay!

846
00:42:58,470 --> 00:42:59,830
Where am I?

847
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:04,410
Now where am I?

848
00:43:06,330 --> 00:43:07,030
Oh.

849
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:12,320
What hill am I in now?

850
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:16,100
Oh, I'm back.

851
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:17,900
Yay!

852
00:43:24,430 --> 00:43:25,130
Okay.

853
00:43:27,510 --> 00:43:28,590
Back now.

854
00:43:29,330 --> 00:43:30,950
Can I go through the arm now?

855
00:43:31,130 --> 00:43:31,470
No.

856
00:43:31,950 --> 00:43:32,310
Okay.

857
00:43:34,230 --> 00:43:35,710
Do I still have to adjust this?

858
00:43:43,450 --> 00:43:44,150
Wait.

859
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:47,010
Is this what I put in last time?

860
00:43:55,110 --> 00:43:56,870
Guys, I have a little problem.

861
00:43:58,050 --> 00:43:58,450
I...

862
00:43:59,610 --> 00:44:01,270
Is this the section I was on?

863
00:44:03,030 --> 00:44:05,490
Is this the section I was on or is this a new section?

864
00:44:06,590 --> 00:44:06,990
Okay.

865
00:44:08,030 --> 00:44:08,650
Where's your maps?

866
00:44:08,810 --> 00:44:09,850
Dude, I don't fucking...

867
00:44:09,850 --> 00:44:10,550
You think I know?

868
00:44:11,570 --> 00:44:13,730
You think I know what it says?

869
00:44:15,190 --> 00:44:17,190
Guys, I don't know which one I've done though.

870
00:44:17,270 --> 00:44:18,330
Have I done this one yet?

871
00:44:18,850 --> 00:44:20,030
Is this the one I just did?

872
00:44:20,890 --> 00:44:21,870
I can't remember.

873
00:44:24,010 --> 00:44:25,530
Did I do this one yet?

874
00:44:27,210 --> 00:44:29,050
I don't remember!

875
00:44:30,530 --> 00:44:31,730
I don't!

876
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:38,100
It might be.

877
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:44,160
I don't know.

878
00:44:46,340 --> 00:44:47,720
I can't tell.

879
00:45:01,540 --> 00:45:03,380
Have I done this one before?

880
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:11,560
No, I haven't gone the right side yet.

881
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:13,800
Yeah, this is new.

882
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:14,580
Wait, that was easy.

883
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:16,260
Oh.

884
00:45:18,020 --> 00:45:18,380
I

885
00:45:22,540 --> 00:45:24,980
don't want it to be easy anymore.

886
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:31,140
No.

887
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:36,640
Guys, I don't want it to be easy no more.

888
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:37,060
Guys.

889
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:48,020
Why?

890
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:49,340
Why?

891
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:51,560
Why?

892
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:52,940
Why?

893
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:53,800
No!

894
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:09,940
I don't want it to be easy no more!

895
00:46:21,470 --> 00:46:21,810
Yeah.

896
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:27,240
Wait, that door was open.

897
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:32,200
Oh my god.

898
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:43,190
I don't want it to be easy.

899
00:46:43,950 --> 00:46:45,090
I'm sorry.

900
00:46:47,470 --> 00:46:50,110
I'm sorry for calling it easy.

901
00:46:50,250 --> 00:46:51,130
I'm so sorry.

902
00:46:53,450 --> 00:46:55,870
I'm not a queen to ever cry.

903
00:46:57,030 --> 00:46:58,710
I didn't know!

904
00:47:04,430 --> 00:47:05,030
Okay.

905
00:47:06,570 --> 00:47:07,750
Okay, here we go.

906
00:47:08,830 --> 00:47:10,490
Here we go to the next level.

907
00:47:10,950 --> 00:47:12,330
And the next one.

908
00:47:24,730 --> 00:47:26,750
Oh, I'm going to have to fight again.

909
00:47:29,090 --> 00:47:31,390
I'm going to get this guy out of the way first.

910
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:50,660
My buddy!

911
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:53,060
Oh my god.

912
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:59,460
I'm trying to fucking- Not you!

913
00:47:59,460 --> 00:47:59,580
No!

914
00:48:03,740 --> 00:48:04,340
Okay.

915
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:08,100
Okay, it's okay.

916
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:10,500
It's not okay, but like it's okay.

917
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:13,660
There's still one more guy here.

918
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:18,980
I don't like this.

919
00:48:22,090 --> 00:48:22,990
There you are.

920
00:48:25,530 --> 00:48:26,670
Get over here.

921
00:48:33,740 --> 00:48:34,340
Dodge!

922
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:34,880
Oh shit.

923
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:35,900
Oh.

924
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:38,400
I mean, that's cool.

925
00:48:40,060 --> 00:48:42,540
You just- I mean, that's alright.

926
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:44,000
You just got a heart attack?

927
00:48:44,140 --> 00:48:44,880
Fucking great.

928
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:47,400
I need that.

929
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:54,020
I'm glad he just- He just collapsed and just got a heart attack.

930
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,220
That was very helpful.

931
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:04,940
Like Kira just like came in and helped me.

932
00:49:11,620 --> 00:49:14,040
This has to be timed or something.

933
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:15,220
I think.

934
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:17,380
I think this is timed.

935
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:23,000
He's like, what?

936
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:26,080
What?

937
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:29,760
Oh my god, I have like- I have like- Hang on.

938
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:32,440
I need more pistol, please.

939
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:35,040
Oh no.

940
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:43,840
So I'm gonna survive.

941
00:49:44,660 --> 00:49:47,640
I don't know how many of these monsters are there.

942
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:49,560
No,

943
00:50:19,940 --> 00:50:20,280
no, no!

944
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:20,980
Yoink.

945
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:28,100
Is this gonna work?

946
00:50:42,380 --> 00:50:46,240
Oh shit!

947
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:47,120
Wait!

948
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:49,380
Wait, the spawners are here too!

949
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:50,140
That's illegal!

950
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:52,960
Little bitch is getting tired, right?

951
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:57,400
I'm sorry!

952
00:50:58,440 --> 00:50:59,800
I'm so sorry!

953
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:01,600
I'm so-

954
00:51:04,660 --> 00:51:07,120
You guys will get tired eventually.

955
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:18,560
Yippee!

956
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:20,640
Yippee!

957
00:51:25,380 --> 00:51:25,960
Yippee!

958
00:51:26,100 --> 00:51:27,800
Please, come on!

959
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:29,260
Come on!

960
00:51:32,660 --> 00:51:34,040
Is it over?

961
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:37,200
Fucking get a heart attack!

962
00:51:40,060 --> 00:51:41,380
Oh my god, please!

963
00:51:49,930 --> 00:51:51,410
Oh my god!

964
00:51:51,490 --> 00:51:53,270
Why is this so long?!

965
00:51:55,970 --> 00:51:56,850
Is it over?

966
00:51:58,090 --> 00:51:58,930
No, it's not.

967
00:51:59,390 --> 00:52:00,810
No, it's definitely not over.

968
00:52:01,510 --> 00:52:03,470
Oh my god, I'm sorry for saying that.

969
00:52:06,830 --> 00:52:08,010
Is it over now?

970
00:52:09,170 --> 00:52:10,170
Oh, it's over.

971
00:52:10,330 --> 00:52:11,010
Okay, nice.

972
00:52:11,010 --> 00:52:12,390
It was just that easy.

973
00:52:13,570 --> 00:52:15,140
It's just that easy!

974
00:52:18,570 --> 00:52:19,110
Nice.

975
00:52:19,770 --> 00:52:22,030
Oh my god, this one had to be the easiest one.

976
00:52:22,310 --> 00:52:23,090
Not gonna lie.

977
00:52:27,630 --> 00:52:31,510
That's how- That's how you cheese a video game.

978
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:38,400
That honestly was the easiest one out of all of them.

979
00:52:43,170 --> 00:52:43,910
Let's see.

980
00:52:46,950 --> 00:52:48,710
Oh my god, nice meds.

981
00:52:49,050 --> 00:52:51,310
Please, I didn't even shoot anything.

982
00:52:51,470 --> 00:52:55,350
I need- I need- I don't need rifle!

983
00:52:58,650 --> 00:53:02,430
No, I realized it was time when that one leg just fucking had a heart attack.

984
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:10,720
I was like, oh yeah, that's not normal.

985
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:15,780
That's not- That's not normal for that leg to have a heart attack.

986
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:23,640
Oh.

987
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:28,100
Guess I'll go into the- Oh.

988
00:53:30,340 --> 00:53:32,640
Guess I can't go in there.

989
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:34,740
Oh.

990
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:36,260
Hello.

991
00:53:41,780 --> 00:53:47,920
Please, please, please, please, please, please, please!

992
00:53:48,100 --> 00:53:49,820
Please keep going!

993
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:53,020
Oh my god, I'm in the room!

994
00:53:54,580 --> 00:53:56,540
Why would I ever wanna leave?

995
00:53:57,260 --> 00:54:01,840
Why would I- Why would I ever wanna leave?

996
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:09,900
Oh no, I left.

997
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:11,080
No.

998
00:54:11,820 --> 00:54:15,080
No, but it was made for- No, but it felt so good!

999
00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:19,060
It felt so- Oh my god, the paradise of legs!

1000
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:25,480
Like, I should've stayed there for the longer if I knew it was just a- It was just like five seconds!

1001
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:33,520
If I knew it was five- I didn't know they were taking away from me after!

1002
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:36,000
Hello?

1003
00:54:44,570 --> 00:54:45,090
Maria?

1004
00:54:51,870 --> 00:54:53,910
Yeah, but they're existing legs!

1005
00:54:54,010 --> 00:54:56,470
We're not making new legs cause they're already there!

1006
00:54:57,930 --> 00:54:59,090
Wait, is she dead again?

1007
00:55:02,050 --> 00:55:02,570
Maria?

1008
00:55:10,830 --> 00:55:12,770
Oh shit, what?!

1009
00:55:14,050 --> 00:55:15,250
What happened to her?

1010
00:55:18,690 --> 00:55:20,630
Did someone throw acid on her face?

1011
00:55:20,670 --> 00:55:21,750
What happened to her?

1012
00:55:30,220 --> 00:55:30,700
Maria?

1013
00:55:31,740 --> 00:55:33,040
Who did this to you?

1014
00:55:49,030 --> 00:55:50,010
Is that makeup?

1015
00:55:50,250 --> 00:55:52,330
Yeah, makeup is so powerful these days.

1016
00:55:53,330 --> 00:55:54,770
That's not wife, that's new wife.

1017
00:55:55,230 --> 00:55:59,690
Well, that's new dead wife, but like, he already knows what- I mean, that's not new for him.

1018
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,880
Maria is dead now.

1019
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:13,780
Now I- Maria who?

1020
00:56:17,660 --> 00:56:23,100
Now that the distraction is gone, I can focus on what really matters.

1021
00:56:24,540 --> 00:56:28,060
Oh, now you remember your actual dead wife.

1022
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:29,640
That's so fucked.

1023
00:56:31,580 --> 00:56:33,560
Now he remembers her.

1024
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:43,320
All he needed was for Maria to be dead.

1025
00:56:44,540 --> 00:56:45,740
Remember, Mary.

1026
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:49,300
What's this?

1027
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:50,340
Oh, that's his sword!

1028
00:56:51,180 --> 00:56:53,200
Oh, he does not like puzzles.

1029
00:56:57,940 --> 00:56:59,500
Oh my god, guys, look.

1030
00:57:00,020 --> 00:57:00,980
You guys know I lift?

1031
00:57:01,700 --> 00:57:02,440
That's right.

1032
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:05,640
Wait, can I- Oh, I can still save, thank god.

1033
00:57:05,700 --> 00:57:08,900
I was gonna be like- Am I not allowed to save if I leave his sword there?

1034
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:12,020
Hey, ladies.

1035
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:14,100
That's right.

1036
00:57:14,940 --> 00:57:15,860
I lift.

1037
00:57:15,860 --> 00:57:17,260
Watch this.

1038
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:21,340
Oh my god, I'm so strong.

1039
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:25,480
Is this sexy, ladies?

1040
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:31,240
Me barely able to pick up this giant sword?

1041
00:57:32,820 --> 00:57:34,880
That's so- Oh my god.

1042
00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:38,300
Back in paradise I go.

1043
00:57:39,780 --> 00:57:42,640
Look at that, ladies.

1044
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:46,060
I can almost pick this up.

1045
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:51,000
No, they're dying!

1046
00:57:52,060 --> 00:57:52,660
No!

1047
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:55,360
But for life!

1048
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:02,440
Oh my god.

1049
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:04,120
It's not fair.

1050
00:58:05,420 --> 00:58:10,100
They were alive when he does it, but when I pick up the sword, they fucking just die.

1051
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:13,580
They're like, oh, that is definitely not sexy.

1052
00:58:13,580 --> 00:58:15,380
I might as well just stop living.

1053
00:58:18,680 --> 00:58:20,020
Alright, down I go.

1054
00:58:26,910 --> 00:58:27,390
Hello.

1055
00:58:28,110 --> 00:58:29,930
Oh, hey, I get to touch grass.

1056
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:34,400
Nice.

1057
00:58:35,260 --> 00:58:37,880
Don't have to go outside, the grass is inside.

1058
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:41,260
Cringe to death.

1059
00:58:41,340 --> 00:58:45,860
They're just like, yeah, no, you are definitely not that strong.

1060
00:58:45,980 --> 00:58:46,760
Walter Sullivan?

1061
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:50,820
Who's Walter again?

1062
00:58:55,310 --> 00:58:55,830
Miriam?

1063
00:58:58,490 --> 00:59:02,890
This fella drank one last bottle of alcohol before escaping and laid there.

1064
00:59:05,410 --> 00:59:06,430
Oh, hey, ammo.

1065
00:59:08,870 --> 00:59:10,370
Am I supposed to go in the hole?

1066
00:59:10,990 --> 00:59:14,030
Oh my god, am I supposed to go into the hole?

1067
00:59:18,970 --> 00:59:20,350
What's this, Angela?

1068
00:59:25,230 --> 00:59:25,750
Eddie?

1069
00:59:26,610 --> 00:59:28,070
Oh, and this is my hole!

1070
00:59:28,790 --> 00:59:29,310
James!

1071
00:59:32,110 --> 00:59:33,330
Why don't I go to his hole?

1072
00:59:33,730 --> 00:59:34,990
Oh, I can't go to his hole.

1073
00:59:35,730 --> 00:59:36,150
Alright.

1074
00:59:37,150 --> 00:59:38,310
Time to go to another hole.

1075
00:59:40,690 --> 00:59:42,130
I love holes.

1076
00:59:43,930 --> 00:59:45,150
Into another hole.

1077
00:59:47,190 --> 00:59:49,910
This hole was definitely made for me, though, this time.

1078
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:01,920
Sorry, I tabbed out.

1079
01:00:04,020 --> 01:00:06,520
I had to check my sound real fast.

1080
01:00:06,620 --> 01:00:08,040
That's why you're like, wait?

1081
01:00:20,150 --> 01:00:21,870
D-Dragon, thank you for the super chat.

1082
01:00:22,010 --> 01:00:23,270
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1083
01:00:23,450 --> 01:00:24,530
Thank you for your medal.

1084
01:00:24,690 --> 01:00:27,650
I always ask you, did you jump into your own grave like James did?

1085
01:00:27,870 --> 01:00:29,110
Thank you for the super chat.

1086
01:00:29,210 --> 01:00:30,150
Thank you, thank you.

1087
01:00:32,270 --> 01:00:33,070
Where am I at?

1088
01:00:34,270 --> 01:00:35,590
I don't like this.

1089
01:00:36,070 --> 01:00:38,150
Oh, there's the blood.

1090
01:00:39,610 --> 01:00:42,450
I was gonna say, I don't- this narrow hallway with no exit?

1091
01:00:44,790 --> 01:00:45,830
Oh, Eddie?

1092
01:00:53,770 --> 01:00:57,670
Wait, that's me.

1093
01:01:03,430 --> 01:01:06,390
Hi, James.

1094
01:01:07,130 --> 01:01:07,370
Hey, Eddie.

1095
01:01:07,750 --> 01:01:08,990
You okay there, buddy?

1096
01:01:13,720 --> 01:01:15,160
What's it look like I'm doing?

1097
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:19,520
You fat, disgusting piece of shit, you make me sick.

1098
01:01:19,780 --> 01:01:21,120
You're gonna cry, fat ass?

1099
01:01:21,120 --> 01:01:22,720
You're gonna run to your mama?

1100
01:01:23,560 --> 01:01:25,900
Waste of skin, why don't you just kill yourself?

1101
01:01:26,840 --> 01:01:28,020
Whoa, in Minecraft?

1102
01:01:30,500 --> 01:01:32,620
Eddie, you're supposed to say in Minecraft, Eddie.

1103
01:01:33,560 --> 01:01:35,980
Eddie, you're supposed to say in Minecraft.

1104
01:01:51,940 --> 01:01:52,300
Oh!

1105
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:01,900
Hey, Eddie, instead of like shooting in the corpse, can I have some of that ammo?

1106
01:02:01,900 --> 01:02:04,340
That pistol ammo that you seem to have a lot of?

1107
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:19,800
Eddie, we just met.

1108
01:02:23,240 --> 01:02:24,820
Like five hours ago?

1109
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:25,740
In game time?

1110
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:29,840
For me, it was for like 20 years, but like...

1111
01:02:30,700 --> 01:02:32,180
Oh, shit!

1112
01:02:37,030 --> 01:02:40,690
Here, I have 20 fucking pill bottles that they keep stuffing me.

1113
01:02:55,610 --> 01:02:56,410
Huh?

1114
01:02:57,290 --> 01:02:57,810
Huh?

1115
01:03:01,460 --> 01:03:01,980
Huh?

1116
01:03:03,380 --> 01:03:04,020
That's me.

1117
01:03:04,760 --> 01:03:06,240
Wait, that looks just like me.

1118
01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:09,360
Wait a minute, Eddie.

1119
01:03:09,720 --> 01:03:11,100
Wait, that looks like me too!

1120
01:03:11,720 --> 01:03:14,220
Eddie, why are your bullies look like me?

1121
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:17,060
Wait, that looks like me too!

1122
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:18,320
Eddie!

1123
01:03:18,740 --> 01:03:20,760
Why do they all look like me?

1124
01:03:20,760 --> 01:03:21,520
Why?

1125
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:27,160
Eddie, you got some explaining to do.

1126
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:29,080
Why do they all look like me, Eddie?

1127
01:03:29,740 --> 01:03:29,980
Why?

1128
01:03:32,260 --> 01:03:32,740
What?

1129
01:03:47,040 --> 01:03:48,580
Oh, you killed a dog?

1130
01:03:48,740 --> 01:03:50,020
I'm bringing the big guns.

1131
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:55,780
Oh, that's where I draw the line.

1132
01:04:01,060 --> 01:04:02,760
What the fuck?

1133
01:04:03,400 --> 01:04:05,420
Yeah, because you killed the dog!

1134
01:04:16,820 --> 01:04:17,540
Where is he?

1135
01:04:21,260 --> 01:04:22,860
What the fu

1136
01:04:30,370 --> 01:04:32,530
- I'm just gonna run to you.

1137
01:04:45,380 --> 01:04:46,820
That's so stupid.

1138
01:04:47,060 --> 01:04:48,740
Oh, shit, he's not dead?

1139
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:49,400
Okay.

1140
01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:55,940
Takes the shotgun and just starts blasting.

1141
01:05:01,540 --> 01:05:05,540
Where is he?

1142
01:05:09,410 --> 01:05:10,630
This is personal now.

1143
01:05:11,750 --> 01:05:13,350
You got the dog involved.

1144
01:05:14,110 --> 01:05:14,870
This is personal.

1145
01:05:24,360 --> 01:05:25,460
This is personal.

1146
01:05:25,680 --> 01:05:27,020
I can see where you are, Eddie.

1147
01:05:27,840 --> 01:05:28,920
Wait, I lost him.

1148
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:30,820
Oh, never mind, I lost him.

1149
01:05:31,220 --> 01:05:31,820
He

1150
01:05:35,010 --> 01:05:39,090
went right instead of left!

1151
01:05:43,770 --> 01:05:44,530
I don't care!

1152
01:05:44,970 --> 01:05:45,550
Thanks, Eddie.

1153
01:05:46,590 --> 01:05:47,830
What the fuck?

1154
01:05:48,010 --> 01:05:52,450
He just- He just gets his pistol and shoots it.

1155
01:05:55,330 --> 01:05:57,190
Here we go again.

1156
01:05:57,190 --> 01:06:01,470
Bro, how many shotgun bullets do you need?

1157
01:06:10,270 --> 01:06:12,130
I don't know where he is.

1158
01:06:17,330 --> 01:06:18,790
Oh, there he is.

1159
01:06:24,620 --> 01:06:26,080
Oh, I see you.

1160
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:29,580
Oh, what?

1161
01:06:32,540 --> 01:06:35,260
I fucking clearly was supposed to shoot first!

1162
01:06:43,140 --> 01:06:44,800
Oh, shit, no, I have to reload!

1163
01:06:45,220 --> 01:06:46,900
I have to reload, I'm sorry!

1164
01:06:47,080 --> 01:06:48,620
Okay, I'm going to reload everything first.

1165
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:50,600
Alright.

1166
01:06:53,580 --> 01:06:54,180
What?!

1167
01:06:54,180 --> 01:06:55,460
Me first.

1168
01:06:56,420 --> 01:06:57,040
Me first.

1169
01:06:57,360 --> 01:06:58,460
No, no, no, no!

1170
01:07:00,340 --> 01:07:00,940
No!

1171
01:07:12,040 --> 01:07:14,560
I moved at the last second!

1172
01:07:14,680 --> 01:07:16,060
That's so bullshit!

1173
01:07:16,860 --> 01:07:19,080
I would have gotten the kill!

1174
01:07:19,080 --> 01:07:24,140
Oh my god, I actually would have gotten the kill!

1175
01:07:24,600 --> 01:07:26,760
I moved at the last second!

1176
01:07:27,160 --> 01:07:31,100
Bro, fuck you, Eddie, I'm fucking coming after you!

1177
01:07:42,240 --> 01:07:43,640
It's the pigs!

1178
01:07:43,720 --> 01:07:44,360
It's RNG!

1179
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:49,060
I got- I got RNG'd, guys!

1180
01:07:49,060 --> 01:07:51,460
That was pure RNG!

1181
01:07:56,820 --> 01:07:59,940
Look, I saw red when he got the dog involved, guys.

1182
01:08:00,060 --> 01:08:01,000
I saw red.

1183
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:03,200
You don't understand.

1184
01:08:05,140 --> 01:08:06,620
I was not thinking.

1185
01:08:07,840 --> 01:08:10,440
He got the dog involved, so I stopped thinking.

1186
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:12,840
All I wanted to do was shoot him.

1187
01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:15,660
What the fuck?

1188
01:08:16,540 --> 01:08:17,300
I have a gun.

1189
01:08:21,870 --> 01:08:23,150
Where did he go?

1190
01:08:30,450 --> 01:08:31,190
Where is he?

1191
01:08:38,990 --> 01:08:39,670
Ow!

1192
01:08:46,020 --> 01:08:46,700
Nice,

1193
01:08:50,860 --> 01:08:51,100
okay!

1194
01:08:53,280 --> 01:08:55,480
Alright, Eddie, I'm locking in now.

1195
01:08:56,220 --> 01:08:59,180
It might start moving, but I'm locking in.

1196
01:09:07,760 --> 01:09:08,400
Missy.

1197
01:09:09,280 --> 01:09:09,980
Over there.

1198
01:09:14,480 --> 01:09:14,800
It's

1199
01:09:26,920 --> 01:09:27,160
me!

1200
01:09:27,900 --> 01:09:29,860
That should not have hit me, guys.

1201
01:09:31,380 --> 01:09:33,260
That should not have hit me.

1202
01:09:38,860 --> 01:09:39,500
Over there.

1203
01:09:44,750 --> 01:09:47,190
Stop running, please, for the love of god.

1204
01:09:53,380 --> 01:09:55,320
There we go, that's right!

1205
01:09:55,700 --> 01:09:56,960
I'm locked in!

1206
01:10:03,630 --> 01:10:05,490
Oh, he's so fucking fast!

1207
01:10:09,260 --> 01:10:11,120
I had to... Guys, you don't understand.

1208
01:10:11,220 --> 01:10:13,720
The first time I died, I was mad.

1209
01:10:13,980 --> 01:10:15,760
He got the dog involved, chat.

1210
01:10:15,800 --> 01:10:16,700
You don't understand.

1211
01:10:18,820 --> 01:10:20,360
I was not thinking.

1212
01:10:20,840 --> 01:10:23,660
I was like, how dare... I don't care about the guy you killed.

1213
01:10:23,860 --> 01:10:26,100
That looks just like me, which is a little concerning.

1214
01:10:26,740 --> 01:10:28,880
But, you got the dog involved.

1215
01:10:35,900 --> 01:10:38,220
How come he can take like 20 shots?

1216
01:10:38,360 --> 01:10:39,300
Oh, I killed a man, too.

1217
01:10:39,900 --> 01:10:41,220
Yep, James, you did that.

1218
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:42,640
A human being.

1219
01:10:42,820 --> 01:10:43,760
But he deserved it.

1220
01:10:45,580 --> 01:10:46,540
He deserved it.

1221
01:10:46,540 --> 01:10:48,240
He killed a dog, James.

1222
01:10:48,300 --> 01:10:49,380
You gotta remember that.

1223
01:10:53,980 --> 01:10:55,120
It was self-defense.

1224
01:10:55,340 --> 01:10:55,820
Exactly.

1225
01:11:00,140 --> 01:11:01,720
All dogs are safe now.

1226
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:02,800
Oh, I'm on the outside!

1227
01:11:09,380 --> 01:11:10,140
Oh, man.

1228
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:12,520
There we go.

1229
01:11:13,880 --> 01:11:15,100
Back to my pistol.

1230
01:11:18,600 --> 01:11:20,460
Oh, into the boat I go.

1231
01:11:21,100 --> 01:11:22,180
What's the boat for?

1232
01:11:37,130 --> 01:11:38,110
Wait, you're right.

1233
01:11:38,530 --> 01:11:40,910
He said that while I was wearing my dog cosplay.

1234
01:11:41,290 --> 01:11:42,490
That's so fucked.

1235
01:11:42,650 --> 01:11:44,170
He knew what he was getting into.

1236
01:11:48,870 --> 01:11:50,050
He knew exactly.

1237
01:11:50,090 --> 01:11:52,710
He should not have said that to me when I was in my dog cosplay.

1238
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:00,880
Okay.

1239
01:12:01,580 --> 01:12:02,600
Row, row, row.

1240
01:12:03,380 --> 01:12:04,160
Row, row.

1241
01:12:07,730 --> 01:12:09,090
Row, row, row.

1242
01:12:10,630 --> 01:12:12,110
Where would I go?

1243
01:12:13,470 --> 01:12:16,950
Maybe if I keep rowing forward, it will lead me to the place.

1244
01:12:19,790 --> 01:12:20,270
See?

1245
01:12:20,530 --> 01:12:21,370
Dad agrees with me.

1246
01:12:21,450 --> 01:12:22,310
He's like, that's right!

1247
01:12:22,430 --> 01:12:23,090
Preach it!

1248
01:12:23,530 --> 01:12:24,790
Preach it, doggy!

1249
01:12:25,870 --> 01:12:27,130
Dad, thank you for the super chat.

1250
01:12:27,210 --> 01:12:28,110
Thank you, thank you.

1251
01:12:28,110 --> 01:12:30,530
Can't believe Eddie didn't watch John Wick.

1252
01:12:30,650 --> 01:12:32,450
Should have known to never get exactly.

1253
01:12:32,870 --> 01:12:33,790
You should have known.

1254
01:12:35,770 --> 01:12:37,890
He knew exactly what he was getting into.

1255
01:12:38,110 --> 01:12:39,330
Am I going the right way?

1256
01:12:41,750 --> 01:12:42,190
Oh.

1257
01:12:42,890 --> 01:12:45,190
I mean, I'm following this light over there.

1258
01:12:46,350 --> 01:12:46,690
Right?

1259
01:12:47,970 --> 01:12:48,410
Oh.

1260
01:12:48,750 --> 01:12:49,630
Oh yeah, the light's here.

1261
01:12:49,710 --> 01:12:50,010
Yeah.

1262
01:12:56,100 --> 01:12:57,600
D-Dragon, thank you for the super chat.

1263
01:12:57,680 --> 01:12:58,280
Thank you, thank you.

1264
01:12:58,340 --> 01:13:01,040
I know for a fact you ain't getting the dog ending.

1265
01:13:01,040 --> 01:13:08,220
But it's heavily speculated in the OG that dog in the ending was the same one Eddie- Wait, he killed a sheep?!

1266
01:13:08,220 --> 01:13:10,160
I'm literally wearing his head!

1267
01:13:10,260 --> 01:13:12,100
Oh my god, I'm like his biggest fan.

1268
01:13:12,340 --> 01:13:15,720
That's right, you should have never confessed to me.

1269
01:13:18,640 --> 01:13:22,160
That was his biggest mistake, confessing the kill.

1270
01:13:22,760 --> 01:13:25,040
I'm literally his biggest fan.

1271
01:13:25,580 --> 01:13:28,340
I'm wearing his fucking head right now.

1272
01:13:29,300 --> 01:13:32,600
I bought that at DogCon 2024.

1273
01:13:33,160 --> 01:13:34,660
How fucking dare he.

1274
01:13:41,640 --> 01:13:43,340
I avenged my Oshie.

1275
01:13:44,240 --> 01:13:46,040
That's literally my Oshie right there.

1276
01:13:50,970 --> 01:13:52,830
Guys, it's okay, I already knew about the dog ending.

1277
01:13:53,050 --> 01:13:56,590
But I didn't know that- I didn't know that was the dog that he might have killed.

1278
01:14:16,860 --> 01:14:18,700
Well, I'm here now.

1279
01:14:19,580 --> 01:14:21,680
Oh my god, it's like so foggy.

1280
01:14:23,180 --> 01:14:25,900
You gotta rename this town Solid Foggy Hill.

1281
01:14:29,120 --> 01:14:30,580
I still have to go up.

1282
01:14:36,760 --> 01:14:38,600
Oh hey, I remember this place.

1283
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:41,100
Which way do I go?

1284
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:46,440
I don't have my map anymore.

1285
01:14:52,840 --> 01:14:54,540
Go this way?

1286
01:15:01,780 --> 01:15:04,020
Oh, is this Mary's favorite place?

1287
01:15:05,380 --> 01:15:09,140
Has the cold draw near as they abandon their own nest to return in time.

1288
01:15:15,870 --> 01:15:17,570
Is this her special place?

1289
01:15:23,580 --> 01:15:24,760
Is there any ammo?

1290
01:15:24,940 --> 01:15:26,340
Maybe Mary left some ammo.

1291
01:15:27,500 --> 01:15:28,740
In her special area.

1292
01:15:29,240 --> 01:15:30,340
In her special place.

1293
01:15:33,040 --> 01:15:33,560
Mary,

1294
01:15:37,480 --> 01:15:39,960
can you do me a solid and leave some ammo for me?

1295
01:15:40,680 --> 01:15:42,220
I don't think there's anything here.

1296
01:15:46,760 --> 01:15:48,120
I don't think so.

1297
01:15:52,310 --> 01:15:53,110
Alright.

1298
01:15:54,090 --> 01:15:55,370
Oh, it's here.

1299
01:15:56,370 --> 01:15:59,970
Special places spark fires that warm our hearts forever.

1300
01:16:04,360 --> 01:16:05,880
Oh, it's back here!

1301
01:16:08,600 --> 01:16:09,920
Our room!

1302
01:16:14,510 --> 01:16:15,390
Okay.

1303
01:16:16,710 --> 01:16:20,150
Okay, this is- We're not close to our room.

1304
01:16:20,850 --> 01:16:21,830
Good to know.

1305
01:16:24,610 --> 01:16:25,990
Oh, nice save.

1306
01:16:29,600 --> 01:16:30,620
Alright, save.

1307
01:16:31,580 --> 01:16:32,340
Oh my god, I knew it.

1308
01:16:32,360 --> 01:16:33,240
She was still alive!

1309
01:16:33,580 --> 01:16:34,620
She wants to hook up!

1310
01:16:35,060 --> 01:16:36,220
I fucking knew it!

1311
01:16:37,980 --> 01:16:39,200
Key and ornament key.

1312
01:16:39,340 --> 01:16:39,720
312.

1313
01:16:39,960 --> 01:16:41,180
Is that our special place?

1314
01:16:46,790 --> 01:16:48,010
There's three floors?

1315
01:16:51,410 --> 01:16:51,990
312.

1316
01:16:54,570 --> 01:16:55,150
Oh.

1317
01:16:57,910 --> 01:16:59,370
Is this a booty call?

1318
01:16:59,370 --> 01:17:01,750
Did Mary send me a ghost booty call?

1319
01:17:03,450 --> 01:17:05,590
Oh Mary, you're so silly.

1320
01:17:07,770 --> 01:17:11,250
Oh my god, she sent me a ghost booty call.

1321
01:17:11,430 --> 01:17:12,230
She's so silly.

1322
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:21,380
Nice, more meds.

1323
01:17:26,140 --> 01:17:26,700
102.

1324
01:17:28,080 --> 01:17:30,560
Oh, there's gonna be a lot of monsters in this hotel.

1325
01:17:30,700 --> 01:17:31,780
I can feel it already.

1326
01:17:34,600 --> 01:17:37,420
I can feel it.

1327
01:17:44,090 --> 01:17:45,850
What's this?

1328
01:18:10,160 --> 01:18:11,280
Paranormal flirtation.

1329
01:18:14,180 --> 01:18:19,080
What would I even like- What would I even be like, if I have a ghost booty call?

1330
01:18:23,920 --> 01:18:28,700
It's like, they're not physical, so it's like, how does that even work?

1331
01:18:31,740 --> 01:18:32,700
Knock knock.

1332
01:18:33,640 --> 01:18:34,760
Anything in the bathroom?

1333
01:18:36,940 --> 01:18:39,260
But don't they just pass through you?

1334
01:18:41,620 --> 01:18:44,420
Mr. or Mrs. Ghost.

1335
01:18:45,080 --> 01:18:50,100
Wouldn't it be so sexy if you could look inside me right now?

1336
01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:53,160
Oh my god.

1337
01:18:53,940 --> 01:18:55,300
Oh my god.

1338
01:18:55,600 --> 01:18:57,400
Come and ectoplasm me.

1339
01:18:58,620 --> 01:19:01,600
It's like, some ghosts leave ectoplasm, right?

1340
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:05,400
It's like, oh my god.

1341
01:19:05,480 --> 01:19:08,940
Hey there, come and ectoplasm me right now.

1342
01:19:10,460 --> 01:19:11,100
What?

1343
01:19:11,100 --> 01:19:12,220
Oh my god.

1344
01:19:13,020 --> 01:19:13,340
Bro?

1345
01:19:20,700 --> 01:19:21,340
Bro,

1346
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:25,920
she left me to die.

1347
01:19:26,060 --> 01:19:27,240
How am I okay with her?

1348
01:19:38,740 --> 01:19:39,640
Oh my god.

1349
01:19:39,640 --> 01:19:40,020
I'm like, calm.

1350
01:19:40,260 --> 01:19:41,840
She literally left me to die.

1351
01:19:55,340 --> 01:19:59,640
Yes, death is not real.

1352
01:20:00,640 --> 01:20:01,480
Tell her.

1353
01:20:01,860 --> 01:20:03,840
Tell her death isn't real.

1354
01:20:05,580 --> 01:20:06,840
She's eight.

1355
01:20:06,900 --> 01:20:07,900
She doesn't know.

1356
01:20:21,800 --> 01:20:22,580
Who's Rachel?

1357
01:20:24,260 --> 01:20:24,560
Yeah.

1358
01:20:27,860 --> 01:20:29,160
Oh, we share nurses.

1359
01:20:33,210 --> 01:20:34,750
Yeah, I know she doesn't see silent.

1360
01:20:34,870 --> 01:20:36,090
She sees normal, but...

1361
01:20:36,090 --> 01:20:38,030
Like, she still locked me inside.

1362
01:20:39,430 --> 01:20:39,790
Like...

1363
01:20:39,790 --> 01:20:40,150
Like,

1364
01:20:45,310 --> 01:20:46,550
how did she think I was gonna get out?

1365
01:21:22,570 --> 01:21:23,110
Laura.

1366
01:21:23,210 --> 01:21:25,730
Laura, don't tell Mary about the other woman, okay?

1367
01:21:26,610 --> 01:21:28,110
Don't tell her about Mary.

1368
01:21:28,330 --> 01:21:29,430
Don't tell her about Maria.

1369
01:21:33,990 --> 01:21:41,570
Don't tell her about Maria.

1370
01:21:42,550 --> 01:21:45,030
Also the nurses, too.

1371
01:21:51,630 --> 01:21:53,770
Yeah, but then she heard me talk about Maria.

1372
01:21:54,110 --> 01:21:55,450
Maria, that's the thing.

1373
01:22:08,060 --> 01:22:12,800
Yeah, I mean...

1374
01:22:12,800 --> 01:22:15,400
Wait, what?

1375
01:22:21,250 --> 01:22:22,770
Oh my god, I knew it.

1376
01:22:23,330 --> 01:22:24,470
I fucking...

1377
01:22:27,250 --> 01:22:29,210
I knew she faked her death.

1378
01:22:29,470 --> 01:22:33,490
She faked her death and then moved to a hospital with Laura.

1379
01:22:33,910 --> 01:22:36,030
So then, like, and then pretended that.

1380
01:22:41,810 --> 01:22:43,510
I fucking knew it.

1381
01:22:43,650 --> 01:22:45,190
I knew my doctors were wrong.

1382
01:22:50,170 --> 01:22:53,510
She faked my death to leave me.

1383
01:22:56,530 --> 01:22:58,530
No, no, wait, wait, wait a minute.

1384
01:23:09,530 --> 01:23:11,590
Figured you didn't deserve to have it.

1385
01:23:31,800 --> 01:23:34,400
It was for the life insurance, guys.

1386
01:23:36,980 --> 01:23:39,320
Guys, it must be for the life insurance.

1387
01:23:47,180 --> 01:23:48,480
Well, where is it then?

1388
01:24:01,670 --> 01:24:03,690
Okay, I knew she wasn't dead.

1389
01:24:05,190 --> 01:24:06,590
I fucking knew it.

1390
01:24:07,410 --> 01:24:08,830
I knew the doctors were wrong.

1391
01:24:08,910 --> 01:24:12,450
We didn't see the bo- I mean, we did see the body during the open casket.

1392
01:24:12,670 --> 01:24:14,910
But, like, how did we know it was her body?

1393
01:24:15,490 --> 01:24:18,230
We didn't do a blood test of the corpse.

1394
01:24:20,250 --> 01:24:23,250
They couldn't- makeup is very powerful these days.

1395
01:24:23,310 --> 01:24:28,430
They could've put makeup on the body that's clearly not Mary and then pass it off as Mary.

1396
01:24:28,510 --> 01:24:29,490
I fucking knew it.

1397
01:24:29,810 --> 01:24:31,310
I knew I was right.

1398
01:24:32,610 --> 01:24:34,030
I knew it.

1399
01:24:35,470 --> 01:24:38,050
I knew she has always been alive.

1400
01:24:44,570 --> 01:24:45,710
They cloned her.

1401
01:24:46,090 --> 01:24:47,250
That could be it.

1402
01:24:47,250 --> 01:24:48,890
They cloned her.

1403
01:24:52,030 --> 01:24:52,850
Oh, no.

1404
01:24:53,030 --> 01:24:56,630
Now it's definitely- Oh, come on.

1405
01:24:56,750 --> 01:24:57,110
Really?

1406
01:25:04,760 --> 01:25:05,980
I fucking knew it.

1407
01:25:08,080 --> 01:25:09,360
She's never dead.

1408
01:25:09,860 --> 01:25:12,420
I knew she was never dead in the first place.

1409
01:25:15,280 --> 01:25:16,700
They were all clones.

1410
01:25:18,940 --> 01:25:20,980
It was makeup.

1411
01:25:22,680 --> 01:25:25,060
We never did a DNA test on the body.

1412
01:25:27,920 --> 01:25:28,640
Aftermath.

1413
01:25:36,020 --> 01:25:37,220
Anything here?

1414
01:25:38,940 --> 01:25:39,660
No.

1415
01:25:44,580 --> 01:25:45,640
Oh, nice.

1416
01:25:45,740 --> 01:25:46,260
More rifle.

1417
01:25:47,740 --> 01:25:49,540
I mean, I have a clone too.

1418
01:25:49,880 --> 01:25:50,740
It's Pyramid Head.

1419
01:25:52,020 --> 01:25:53,940
He looks just like me.

1420
01:25:54,900 --> 01:25:56,640
Guys, in every way.

1421
01:26:00,930 --> 01:26:01,990
Where is it?

1422
01:26:03,250 --> 01:26:04,070
There he is.

1423
01:26:05,290 --> 01:26:06,050
Oh, shit.

1424
01:26:06,370 --> 01:26:07,850
I'm not expecting him to fight back.

1425
01:26:13,590 --> 01:26:15,050
I'm gonna go this way.

1426
01:26:15,290 --> 01:26:16,210
See if there's ammo.

1427
01:26:16,430 --> 01:26:16,750
Nice.

1428
01:26:20,030 --> 01:26:21,350
Hey, I don't make the rules.

1429
01:26:21,930 --> 01:26:23,790
Of course my clone would be Pyramid Head.

1430
01:26:24,350 --> 01:26:25,850
He's literally in my head.

1431
01:26:28,490 --> 01:26:29,130
What?

1432
01:26:29,450 --> 01:26:31,310
Where did she come from?

1433
01:26:33,870 --> 01:26:37,030
Okay, I don't know where the fuck she came from there.

1434
01:26:44,690 --> 01:26:45,330
Okay.

1435
01:26:49,290 --> 01:26:52,010
Where the fuck did she pop up?

1436
01:26:53,090 --> 01:26:54,970
Like, is there any way here?

1437
01:26:56,870 --> 01:26:59,530
Was it really from here and I didn't see?

1438
01:27:07,050 --> 01:27:07,930
I have 102.

1439
01:27:10,270 --> 01:27:11,330
I explored.

1440
01:27:14,370 --> 01:27:15,730
More syringes.

1441
01:27:15,970 --> 01:27:16,630
Nice.

1442
01:27:17,290 --> 01:27:19,230
Can I have some pistol ammo, please?

1443
01:27:19,710 --> 01:27:22,870
Oh, I don't need rifle rounds, but okay.

1444
01:27:24,410 --> 01:27:25,170
That's alright.

1445
01:27:25,730 --> 01:27:27,090
Oh, rifle and shotgun?

1446
01:27:27,330 --> 01:27:28,310
Oh my god.

1447
01:27:29,550 --> 01:27:31,430
Have I reloaded everything yet?

1448
01:27:31,570 --> 01:27:32,010
Okay, no.

1449
01:27:33,630 --> 01:27:35,310
Let me make sure I have everything reloaded.

1450
01:27:37,510 --> 01:27:38,590
No, no, I can't.

1451
01:27:38,590 --> 01:27:39,750
I can't take my meds.

1452
01:27:40,030 --> 01:27:42,270
I can't take my meds because Mary will disappear.

1453
01:27:49,010 --> 01:27:49,830
Oh, shit.

1454
01:27:49,890 --> 01:27:50,810
I'm sorry for laughing.

1455
01:27:52,390 --> 01:27:54,490
I just wanted to shoot you in the knees.

1456
01:28:01,690 --> 01:28:03,470
I can't go to staff only.

1457
01:28:07,060 --> 01:28:08,520
I can go outside though.

1458
01:28:08,560 --> 01:28:09,420
I can touch grass.

1459
01:28:11,540 --> 01:28:12,720
Oh, thank god.

1460
01:28:12,860 --> 01:28:13,720
More handgun ammo.

1461
01:28:13,880 --> 01:28:15,040
I need this so badly.

1462
01:28:19,650 --> 01:28:20,290
Wait,

1463
01:28:24,380 --> 01:28:25,280
can I cross this?

1464
01:28:25,480 --> 01:28:26,100
Oh, nice.

1465
01:28:27,780 --> 01:28:29,040
What do I do?

1466
01:28:34,050 --> 01:28:34,590
Here?

1467
01:28:38,470 --> 01:28:39,650
Anybody hiding?

1468
01:28:40,930 --> 01:28:42,230
Any little freaks here?

1469
01:28:42,630 --> 01:28:43,350
In the hotel?

1470
01:28:46,870 --> 01:28:49,050
Any little freaks here?

1471
01:28:49,710 --> 01:28:50,930
Calling all freaks?

1472
01:28:54,750 --> 01:28:56,350
There's no loot?

1473
01:28:56,590 --> 01:28:57,610
Oh my god, what?

1474
01:29:00,910 --> 01:29:02,430
There has to be nothing?

1475
01:29:03,850 --> 01:29:07,390
That's actually so- This room had nothing.

1476
01:29:09,230 --> 01:29:10,810
That's so bullshit.

1477
01:29:12,910 --> 01:29:14,290
Oh, I'm back here.

1478
01:29:15,150 --> 01:29:15,510
Oh.

1479
01:29:16,350 --> 01:29:18,270
I didn't realize this was a way.

1480
01:29:19,550 --> 01:29:22,330
What the fuck was the point of being here?

1481
01:29:25,350 --> 01:29:27,670
There's actually nothing here.

1482
01:29:29,350 --> 01:29:32,490
You get nothing, dookie.

1483
01:29:32,550 --> 01:29:33,190
Isn't that great?

1484
01:29:37,150 --> 01:29:37,890
Oh.

1485
01:29:38,390 --> 01:29:39,390
That's not cool.

1486
01:29:41,230 --> 01:29:42,650
Just got back up.

1487
01:29:45,290 --> 01:29:46,030
What?

1488
01:29:46,030 --> 01:29:46,050
Okay.

1489
01:29:49,250 --> 01:29:50,290
What the fuck?

1490
01:29:50,350 --> 01:29:51,030
Who are you?

1491
01:29:52,590 --> 01:29:54,530
Where did you come from?

1492
01:29:59,030 --> 01:29:59,590
Alright.

1493
01:30:00,350 --> 01:30:02,090
Where did this girl come from?

1494
01:30:07,920 --> 01:30:09,940
Just got up in front of me.

1495
01:30:12,020 --> 01:30:14,140
Wait, does that mean the others get back up too?

1496
01:30:14,200 --> 01:30:14,520
No.

1497
01:30:15,240 --> 01:30:15,800
No.

1498
01:30:16,320 --> 01:30:19,180
Are we back in the area where they all just get up?

1499
01:30:19,820 --> 01:30:20,420
No.

1500
01:30:23,540 --> 01:30:25,620
No, that's not fair.

1501
01:30:26,160 --> 01:30:29,640
What do you mean they can just get back up?

1502
01:30:29,900 --> 01:30:30,360
No.

1503
01:30:36,630 --> 01:30:39,670
That's the one thing I don't want.

1504
01:30:43,770 --> 01:30:47,610
Helix seems to have some kind of pest separate from the rest of the plants or it'll all die.

1505
01:30:49,830 --> 01:30:51,970
This is Sunrise Winky.

1506
01:30:53,730 --> 01:30:55,330
I'm sad now.

1507
01:30:56,010 --> 01:30:59,530
I'm sad because that means they can all come back to life.

1508
01:30:59,610 --> 01:31:01,370
I thought we were over that.

1509
01:31:02,150 --> 01:31:03,870
I thought that was over.

1510
01:31:06,890 --> 01:31:09,210
I thought we moved past it.

1511
01:31:15,480 --> 01:31:16,240
Okay.

1512
01:31:17,340 --> 01:31:19,100
It's obviously here.

1513
01:31:21,480 --> 01:31:21,860
So...

1514
01:31:22,240 --> 01:31:24,940
I gotta go back to the beginning.

1515
01:31:28,540 --> 01:31:30,040
Sunrise Wing.

1516
01:31:32,440 --> 01:31:34,660
Gotta go to Sunrise Wing.

1517
01:31:36,040 --> 01:31:38,420
And then I have to remember where the save point is.

1518
01:31:45,990 --> 01:31:48,550
I think it's here?

1519
01:31:49,650 --> 01:31:50,090
Yeah.

1520
01:31:50,090 --> 01:31:50,470
Yeah.

1521
01:31:56,010 --> 01:31:56,530
Goddammit.

1522
01:31:56,810 --> 01:32:00,890
Why does this hotel have all the keys just lying conveniently to here?

1523
01:32:12,270 --> 01:32:14,570
Wait, what?

1524
01:32:15,570 --> 01:32:16,510
I have a special tape?

1525
01:32:17,650 --> 01:32:18,450
Wait, where's the save?

1526
01:32:21,460 --> 01:32:22,940
Where would the save be?

1527
01:32:27,870 --> 01:32:29,510
Wait, this is the first floor.

1528
01:32:30,150 --> 01:32:31,610
This is not the first floor?

1529
01:32:33,870 --> 01:32:36,250
Oh no, what kind of tape is it?

1530
01:32:38,150 --> 01:32:39,270
Oh, god.

1531
01:32:40,050 --> 01:32:42,970
James, what kind of tape was it, James?

1532
01:32:50,120 --> 01:32:51,140
Employee section.

1533
01:32:52,020 --> 01:32:54,080
Oh, I can't even get there.

1534
01:32:57,290 --> 01:32:59,670
I can't even get to the employee section.

1535
01:33:07,960 --> 01:33:10,160
Why do I want to be in the basement?

1536
01:33:15,180 --> 01:33:18,600
The basement seems to be the freakiest area.

1537
01:33:19,040 --> 01:33:21,820
So I'm gonna head back upstairs.

1538
01:33:25,280 --> 01:33:27,640
Maybe I'll go upstairs.

1539
01:33:29,400 --> 01:33:31,780
Feels a little less freaky.

1540
01:33:37,730 --> 01:33:40,330
Yeah, we have to be upstairs anyway.

1541
01:33:43,390 --> 01:33:43,830
Oh.

1542
01:33:47,230 --> 01:33:48,510
Oh, I hear people.

1543
01:33:51,960 --> 01:33:52,760
Hello?

1544
01:34:01,590 --> 01:34:02,390
I

1545
01:34:13,640 --> 01:34:15,200
don't like this room.

1546
01:34:19,660 --> 01:34:21,680
I really don't like this room.

1547
01:34:25,340 --> 01:34:29,420
I really do not like this room at all.

1548
01:34:34,870 --> 01:34:35,670
202.

1549
01:34:38,390 --> 01:34:39,130
I fucking knew it.

1550
01:34:39,290 --> 01:34:39,990
I knew it.

1551
01:34:40,010 --> 01:34:40,690
I knew you were...

1552
01:34:40,690 --> 01:34:42,250
I fucking knew it.

1553
01:34:42,350 --> 01:34:43,290
I knew it.

1554
01:34:43,490 --> 01:34:45,330
I fucking knew you were there.

1555
01:34:49,130 --> 01:34:50,090
Get down.

1556
01:34:50,350 --> 01:34:51,630
Why are you so stinky?

1557
01:34:56,540 --> 01:34:58,200
I knew you were hiding there.

1558
01:34:59,240 --> 01:35:00,260
You little bitch.

1559
01:35:03,440 --> 01:35:05,200
John, thank you for the super chat thing.

1560
01:35:05,320 --> 01:35:05,940
Thank you.

1561
01:35:06,040 --> 01:35:07,640
7-4-1-4?

1562
01:35:07,780 --> 01:35:08,560
What does that mean?

1563
01:35:09,400 --> 01:35:10,500
I have an apple.

1564
01:35:12,140 --> 01:35:12,740
Whoa!

1565
01:35:12,980 --> 01:35:13,680
Oh, it's a safe!

1566
01:35:14,380 --> 01:35:15,540
It's a freaky safe!

1567
01:35:17,400 --> 01:35:18,540
I don't remember it.

1568
01:35:19,060 --> 01:35:19,640
You!

1569
01:35:23,880 --> 01:35:24,560
That's it.

1570
01:35:24,580 --> 01:35:25,480
I'm tired of this.

1571
01:35:31,330 --> 01:35:32,730
It's a freaky safe.

1572
01:35:33,050 --> 01:35:33,970
Oh my god.

1573
01:35:34,190 --> 01:35:35,030
My hero.

1574
01:35:35,690 --> 01:35:36,290
Again?

1575
01:35:39,190 --> 01:35:40,350
Oh my god.

1576
01:35:40,650 --> 01:35:42,030
Don't worry, Mary.

1577
01:35:42,230 --> 01:35:44,930
I'll make sure no one watches that video.

1578
01:35:45,110 --> 01:35:46,870
As your dying wish.

1579
01:35:47,270 --> 01:35:51,070
I'll make sure nobody will know this video exists.

1580
01:35:55,510 --> 01:35:56,370
Nurse's office.

1581
01:35:56,830 --> 01:35:59,010
I'd like to go to the reading room because there's a question mark.

1582
01:35:59,110 --> 01:36:00,290
I'm gonna go to the reading room first.

1583
01:36:08,200 --> 01:36:10,820
It's like there's question marks at the reading room.

1584
01:36:11,380 --> 01:36:13,280
So like, I feel like it's like...

1585
01:36:13,280 --> 01:36:14,480
Maybe you should go there.

1586
01:36:16,100 --> 01:36:17,660
Oh, because it's a safe point.

1587
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:19,680
Oh, that makes a lot of sense now.

1588
01:36:24,200 --> 01:36:24,900
Okay.

1589
01:36:26,200 --> 01:36:27,500
The one who's sword.

1590
01:36:33,430 --> 01:36:34,470
Oh, fuck.

1591
01:36:34,550 --> 01:36:34,730
Okay.

1592
01:36:37,930 --> 01:36:39,310
Don't worry, Mary.

1593
01:36:39,690 --> 01:36:41,430
I'll make sure it's safe.

1594
01:36:42,650 --> 01:36:43,350
What?

1595
01:36:48,460 --> 01:36:52,080
Oh, I have to place the books.

1596
01:36:56,160 --> 01:36:57,800
I don't know what any of these mean.

1597
01:37:03,880 --> 01:37:05,860
Pride before the fall.

1598
01:37:06,300 --> 01:37:08,660
How the fuck do I sort this out?

1599
01:37:10,140 --> 01:37:10,980
What?

1600
01:37:21,660 --> 01:37:22,500
How?

1601
01:37:36,050 --> 01:37:36,890
What?

1602
01:37:37,690 --> 01:37:39,230
Oh, I... Okay.

1603
01:37:46,250 --> 01:37:48,410
I'll never learn, I guess.

1604
01:37:48,430 --> 01:37:49,090
Let's go.

1605
01:37:49,090 --> 01:37:49,230
Oh.

1606
01:37:51,730 --> 01:37:54,150
I don't... I don't understand.

1607
01:37:54,890 --> 01:37:56,270
What did that all mean?

1608
01:37:56,770 --> 01:38:02,850
What did the numbers mean?

1609
01:38:07,370 --> 01:38:07,770
217?

1610
01:38:13,980 --> 01:38:16,220
Oh, this is a spooky room.

1611
01:38:19,440 --> 01:38:20,080
What?

1612
01:38:21,140 --> 01:38:23,380
There's another puzzle within a puzzle?

1613
01:38:25,440 --> 01:38:27,080
Oh, who keeps taking these photos?

1614
01:38:29,040 --> 01:38:30,480
Shadow, thank you for the superchat.

1615
01:38:30,600 --> 01:38:31,620
Thank you, thank you.

1616
01:38:36,140 --> 01:38:37,400
Okay, I need to find a lightbulb.

1617
01:38:42,980 --> 01:38:44,740
What's this puzzle within a puzzle?

1618
01:38:46,160 --> 01:38:47,820
Have I already found this one yet?

1619
01:38:47,900 --> 01:38:49,180
No, I must not have.

1620
01:38:49,320 --> 01:38:50,640
I brute-forced the other puzzle.

1621
01:38:51,320 --> 01:38:56,240
So, I feel... I don't know how I solved this one.

1622
01:38:56,620 --> 01:38:57,240
But, okay.

1623
01:39:00,580 --> 01:39:05,680
Shadow, in the corner you didn't decide to go, there was another apple on the bench there.

1624
01:39:05,740 --> 01:39:07,140
Wait, which corner?

1625
01:39:07,600 --> 01:39:09,580
There were a lot of corners, guys.

1626
01:39:10,660 --> 01:39:12,240
There was a lot.

1627
01:39:12,320 --> 01:39:14,260
You gotta be more specific there.

1628
01:39:15,880 --> 01:39:16,800
A painting?

1629
01:39:17,020 --> 01:39:17,760
There was a painting?

1630
01:39:18,660 --> 01:39:18,960
Oh!

1631
01:39:21,520 --> 01:39:22,000
Oh!

1632
01:39:26,220 --> 01:39:27,380
I'm just that smart.

1633
01:39:27,380 --> 01:39:29,380
I, like, subconsciously...

1634
01:39:32,320 --> 01:39:34,020
I subconsciously took that in.

1635
01:39:40,690 --> 01:39:44,670
I guess, like, I have to get the red light and it'll, like, solve this one.

1636
01:39:44,830 --> 01:39:46,030
So, I need to find a lightbulb.

1637
01:39:47,350 --> 01:39:48,610
Oh, was it the outside?

1638
01:39:48,730 --> 01:39:49,610
Like, this outside?

1639
01:39:50,970 --> 01:39:51,410
Here?

1640
01:39:53,450 --> 01:39:55,270
Or the bottom floor outside?

1641
01:39:55,570 --> 01:39:59,050
Oh my god, it was the ragdoll.

1642
01:40:00,390 --> 01:40:01,270
This outside?

1643
01:40:05,360 --> 01:40:07,520
I assume it's the bottom floor, right?

1644
01:40:14,340 --> 01:40:15,740
Wait, I am playing on standard.

1645
01:40:19,750 --> 01:40:20,930
How do I tell?

1646
01:40:25,670 --> 01:40:27,930
How can I prove it to you?

1647
01:40:34,870 --> 01:40:36,150
Wait, where...

1648
01:40:36,890 --> 01:40:39,170
I've been on window this entire time?

1649
01:40:41,190 --> 01:40:42,530
No, I'm on fullscreen.

1650
01:40:42,710 --> 01:40:42,910
Okay.

1651
01:40:44,870 --> 01:40:48,350
There's an apple in that room outside in the garden area?

1652
01:40:52,110 --> 01:40:54,530
There's no apple, you fucking liars.

1653
01:40:56,270 --> 01:40:57,130
Where's the apple?

1654
01:41:01,690 --> 01:41:03,010
Yasmin, thank you for the superchat.

1655
01:41:03,090 --> 01:41:03,910
Thank you, thank you.

1656
01:41:03,970 --> 01:41:07,470
I just had a big fight with my husband, but watching you play this game is making me so happy.

1657
01:41:07,550 --> 01:41:08,230
Thank you, Doki.

1658
01:41:08,310 --> 01:41:09,050
Thank you for the superchat.

1659
01:41:09,130 --> 01:41:09,630
Thank you, thank you.

1660
01:41:09,710 --> 01:41:11,090
Oh no, I hope you feel a lot better.

1661
01:41:11,090 --> 01:41:13,090
Thank you so much for the superchat.

1662
01:41:13,190 --> 01:41:14,170
Thank you, thank you.

1663
01:41:15,430 --> 01:41:16,510
In that room?

1664
01:41:16,850 --> 01:41:17,470
This room?

1665
01:41:18,910 --> 01:41:21,310
The room where it's making little sounds right now going...

1666
01:41:24,510 --> 01:41:24,990
Hey!

1667
01:41:25,870 --> 01:41:27,330
Is there an apple in this room?

1668
01:41:37,680 --> 01:41:40,540
Oh, the room of all... No, I already got the apple though.

1669
01:41:41,180 --> 01:41:42,820
Unless there's another apple I missed.

1670
01:41:44,020 --> 01:41:45,320
I got one of the apples.

1671
01:41:52,980 --> 01:41:54,720
I got this apple.

1672
01:41:55,160 --> 01:41:57,720
There's no way there's another apple.

1673
01:42:00,720 --> 01:42:02,940
Is there another apple I missed?

1674
01:42:05,520 --> 01:42:06,920
Oh, I only need one.

1675
01:42:07,220 --> 01:42:07,520
Good.

1676
01:42:15,280 --> 01:42:16,180
Staff only?

1677
01:42:16,320 --> 01:42:17,740
I'm staff, technically.

1678
01:42:21,150 --> 01:42:21,910
Okay.

1679
01:42:23,790 --> 01:42:25,750
Alright, down we go.

1680
01:42:32,720 --> 01:42:33,240
Hello?

1681
01:42:35,020 --> 01:42:35,540
Hello?

1682
01:42:37,280 --> 01:42:37,800
Hello?

1683
01:42:38,840 --> 01:42:40,820
If I say hello, you gotta say hello back.

1684
01:42:40,880 --> 01:42:41,600
It's the rules.

1685
01:42:44,360 --> 01:42:44,880
Hello?

1686
01:42:46,980 --> 01:42:48,360
Please say hello back.

1687
01:42:48,720 --> 01:42:49,040
Oh!

1688
01:42:49,340 --> 01:42:49,780
I'm sorry!

1689
01:42:49,960 --> 01:42:50,460
I'm sorry!

1690
01:42:53,560 --> 01:42:55,240
You're supposed to say hello back!

1691
01:43:02,600 --> 01:43:04,160
Guys, I meant verbally!

1692
01:43:04,500 --> 01:43:05,620
Say hello back!

1693
01:43:06,820 --> 01:43:07,340
Verbally!

1694
01:43:13,780 --> 01:43:14,820
Instructions uncleared.

1695
01:43:14,900 --> 01:43:15,920
I started slapping.

1696
01:43:20,300 --> 01:43:21,480
Alright, this way.

1697
01:43:23,040 --> 01:43:25,840
She don't have no... Bro, she's just legs.

1698
01:43:25,940 --> 01:43:26,680
What did she expect?

1699
01:43:28,400 --> 01:43:30,420
She doesn't have a mouth.

1700
01:43:31,180 --> 01:43:34,300
I don't know, I thought... I don't know, she could've just waved.

1701
01:43:35,640 --> 01:43:37,380
She didn't need to get physical.

1702
01:43:41,690 --> 01:43:42,250
Oh.

1703
01:43:42,250 --> 01:43:42,810
Oh.

1704
01:43:43,290 --> 01:43:43,850
Oh.

1705
01:43:44,110 --> 01:43:45,330
Oh, do you think he's okay?

1706
01:43:45,530 --> 01:43:46,450
Oh, there you go.

1707
01:43:47,430 --> 01:43:47,930
Oh

1708
01:44:03,120 --> 01:44:04,520
god, it still hit me.

1709
01:44:04,900 --> 01:44:07,080
It actually still hit me.

1710
01:44:10,680 --> 01:44:15,940
Oh my god, I knew there was gonna be a 2v1 and I still got hit!

1711
01:44:20,520 --> 01:44:25,260
Oh please, I think... I'm wasting so much meds in this area.

1712
01:44:25,260 --> 01:44:28,360
There's too many fucking flankers.

1713
01:44:38,250 --> 01:44:39,310
Hello?

1714
01:44:40,430 --> 01:44:41,490
Hello?

1715
01:44:42,670 --> 01:44:44,550
Any hellos back?

1716
01:44:48,040 --> 01:44:48,520
Hello?

1717
01:44:50,970 --> 01:44:52,080
No hellos?

1718
01:44:56,220 --> 01:44:58,560
Alright, I came from here.

1719
01:45:01,700 --> 01:45:04,200
Why does no one wanna say hello to me?

1720
01:45:07,880 --> 01:45:10,600
That guy just walked away, I don't like that.

1721
01:45:15,900 --> 01:45:17,140
Do you think he knows I'm in this room?

1722
01:45:21,850 --> 01:45:23,570
Okay, nice handgun ammo.

1723
01:45:24,850 --> 01:45:25,250
Please.

1724
01:45:26,090 --> 01:45:27,950
Oh my gosh, thank you, more meds.

1725
01:45:32,990 --> 01:45:33,390
Alright.

1726
01:45:35,850 --> 01:45:36,490
Oh no, oh!

1727
01:45:43,760 --> 01:45:45,760
Can't waste any more ammo on these guys.

1728
01:45:45,860 --> 01:45:47,920
Oh shit, oh fuck, okay.

1729
01:45:48,800 --> 01:45:50,060
Gotta get the cockroach too.

1730
01:45:50,780 --> 01:45:52,140
Oh my god, he's so fast.

1731
01:45:52,640 --> 01:45:53,300
Get back here!

1732
01:45:53,960 --> 01:45:55,160
Get back here!

1733
01:45:56,560 --> 01:45:58,600
No, you're staining the floor!

1734
01:46:00,040 --> 01:46:02,520
The chat worked so hard on that!

1735
01:46:04,340 --> 01:46:06,420
Bro, you like stained the carpet!

1736
01:46:13,250 --> 01:46:15,070
What the fuck happened to the bed?

1737
01:46:17,490 --> 01:46:19,930
Why is this just a- oh, there's nothing in here.

1738
01:46:20,090 --> 01:46:21,550
I don't like this room.

1739
01:46:22,010 --> 01:46:24,330
There's just- it's just- there's nothing.

1740
01:46:26,110 --> 01:46:28,870
This room is way too freaky for me.

1741
01:46:29,450 --> 01:46:31,390
This literally has nothing in there.

1742
01:46:34,430 --> 01:46:41,310
You know something is wrong when this room is just an empty room.

1743
01:46:43,170 --> 01:46:44,330
Oh, is this where I put my apple?

1744
01:46:44,330 --> 01:46:44,490
Huh?

1745
01:46:51,070 --> 01:46:51,750
Oh!

1746
01:47:03,920 --> 01:47:04,600
Okay.

1747
01:47:05,920 --> 01:47:06,760
Another puzzle.

1748
01:47:12,340 --> 01:47:13,980
Oh no, that's not how it goes.

1749
01:47:18,280 --> 01:47:21,240
Okay, we're gonna put this down.

1750
01:47:22,460 --> 01:47:24,240
This one has to be here.

1751
01:47:26,940 --> 01:47:28,180
And then...

1752
01:47:28,180 --> 01:47:31,870
Oh my god.

1753
01:47:33,290 --> 01:47:34,890
Oh my god, shapes.

1754
01:47:35,210 --> 01:47:36,350
Fucking shapes.

1755
01:47:37,170 --> 01:47:39,730
I love shapes so much.

1756
01:47:41,210 --> 01:47:41,690
Yeah.

1757
01:47:44,970 --> 01:47:46,290
Wait, we're missing one.

1758
01:47:53,610 --> 01:47:54,790
Oh no, it's right here.

1759
01:47:55,290 --> 01:47:57,390
I was like, wait a minute.

1760
01:47:57,670 --> 01:47:57,930
Wait.

1761
01:48:01,560 --> 01:48:02,940
Wait, why can't I pick up this?

1762
01:48:03,120 --> 01:48:04,400
No, we are missing one!

1763
01:48:05,060 --> 01:48:08,220
Oh, that's just like telling me like, there's one missing here.

1764
01:48:09,580 --> 01:48:10,440
We are!

1765
01:48:27,500 --> 01:48:28,780
Oh, it's right here.

1766
01:48:29,700 --> 01:48:31,200
Why is it just sitting in the bed like that?

1767
01:48:33,460 --> 01:48:35,480
Happy birthday to you.

1768
01:48:35,620 --> 01:48:37,320
Happy birthday to you.

1769
01:48:37,480 --> 01:48:39,220
Happy birthday dear Momo.

1770
01:48:39,780 --> 01:48:41,280
Happy birthday to you.

1771
01:48:41,460 --> 01:48:41,820
Yeah!

1772
01:48:46,510 --> 01:48:47,730
There you go.

1773
01:48:49,650 --> 01:48:50,630
That's me!

1774
01:49:01,280 --> 01:49:02,160
Oh my god, I made a portal!

1775
01:49:06,300 --> 01:49:08,460
Wait, did I make a portal?

1776
01:49:11,280 --> 01:49:12,700
I made a portal.

1777
01:49:13,800 --> 01:49:14,980
How do I get there?

1778
01:49:17,400 --> 01:49:20,760
Wait, does that mean like, this changed?

1779
01:49:22,420 --> 01:49:23,520
Wait, what the fuck?

1780
01:49:24,960 --> 01:49:25,760
Back up.

1781
01:49:27,680 --> 01:49:28,460
That's illegal.

1782
01:49:34,690 --> 01:49:35,170
Yay!

1783
01:49:37,630 --> 01:49:39,490
Okay, well that's no white figurine.

1784
01:49:41,550 --> 01:49:43,790
Oh, so that's why it was empty.

1785
01:49:43,950 --> 01:49:45,390
Oh my god, it makes so much more sense now.

1786
01:49:49,220 --> 01:49:53,060
I was like thinking like, why is it so empty?

1787
01:49:55,780 --> 01:49:57,200
Are you serious?

1788
01:50:01,780 --> 01:50:03,480
Where did that sound come from?

1789
01:50:06,100 --> 01:50:08,140
Someone is alive!

1790
01:50:09,980 --> 01:50:11,640
Who is it?

1791
01:50:14,560 --> 01:50:15,900
Is there a shortcut anywhere?

1792
01:50:20,110 --> 01:50:22,530
I heard someone being alive!

1793
01:50:30,530 --> 01:50:31,730
It's you.

1794
01:50:33,070 --> 01:50:34,330
It's you.

1795
01:50:34,850 --> 01:50:36,930
It's you, it's always you.

1796
01:50:37,390 --> 01:50:38,830
It's always you!

1797
01:50:40,210 --> 01:50:44,670
Why are there so many again?!

1798
01:50:46,170 --> 01:50:47,730
This fucking sucks.

1799
01:50:49,810 --> 01:50:52,650
This actually sucks so much.

1800
01:50:55,810 --> 01:50:56,990
I hate them.

1801
01:50:59,390 --> 01:51:02,470
I hate them, I hate them so much.

1802
01:51:07,010 --> 01:51:12,230
It's like, every time I kill one, another one gives birth to a hundred spiders.

1803
01:51:13,410 --> 01:51:15,870
It never stops, we need to find the nest.

1804
01:51:18,230 --> 01:51:20,110
We need to stop it from the source.

1805
01:51:26,570 --> 01:51:28,910
These are the worst, these are the worst.

1806
01:51:29,310 --> 01:51:31,790
These are actually the worst monsters in this entire game.

1807
01:51:33,730 --> 01:51:34,250
Alright,

1808
01:51:39,840 --> 01:51:40,520
save time.

1809
01:51:45,260 --> 01:51:47,380
You don't understand, Doki.

1810
01:51:47,960 --> 01:51:51,100
The legs, I can't stop myself.

1811
01:51:51,680 --> 01:51:53,680
It's the legs, Doki.

1812
01:51:54,360 --> 01:51:55,860
You don't understand.

1813
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:03,000
Every time I think of a leg, another one pops up.

1814
01:52:14,730 --> 01:52:16,390
It just keeps happening.

1815
01:52:17,330 --> 01:52:18,170
Every time.

1816
01:52:20,230 --> 01:52:22,490
M-S-S, okay.

1817
01:52:24,030 --> 01:52:24,950
It just keeps happening.

1818
01:52:25,470 --> 01:52:27,350
I think of a leg and I'm like, oh fuck!

1819
01:52:27,790 --> 01:52:29,630
Like that, what's his name?

1820
01:52:29,750 --> 01:52:30,230
Paul Rudd.

1821
01:52:30,670 --> 01:52:32,010
The Paul Rudd clip.

1822
01:52:32,750 --> 01:52:34,370
Everything he thinks of is like, fuck!

1823
01:52:36,650 --> 01:52:38,530
Another one just shows up.

1824
01:52:48,720 --> 01:52:49,960
And that's the shortcut.

1825
01:52:52,760 --> 01:52:53,320
Nice.

1826
01:52:53,660 --> 01:52:54,160
Oh shit.

1827
01:53:02,140 --> 01:53:02,520
Okay.

1828
01:53:04,880 --> 01:53:06,900
Oh, where am I now?

1829
01:53:07,060 --> 01:53:08,480
I'm in the employee area.

1830
01:53:16,520 --> 01:53:18,480
Okay, is there anything extra here?

1831
01:53:19,600 --> 01:53:20,760
Nice, more shotgun.

1832
01:53:22,880 --> 01:53:23,440
Oh!

1833
01:53:24,260 --> 01:53:26,020
Okay, do I have...

1834
01:53:26,740 --> 01:53:29,140
No, I don't have the employee elevator.

1835
01:53:34,160 --> 01:53:35,140
Do I have anything?

1836
01:53:38,850 --> 01:53:40,050
Like, where am I?

1837
01:53:41,010 --> 01:53:42,030
Okay, I'm here.

1838
01:53:43,150 --> 01:53:43,830
Can I go up?

1839
01:53:45,770 --> 01:53:47,350
Oh, I can technically.

1840
01:53:48,350 --> 01:53:51,150
Okay, I'll explore downstairs first.

1841
01:53:53,710 --> 01:53:54,930
More shotgun.

1842
01:53:56,750 --> 01:54:00,730
I used all of that on fucking Eddie's big stomach.

1843
01:54:01,290 --> 01:54:03,510
Bro, his stomach tanked like 20 shots.

1844
01:54:04,310 --> 01:54:05,490
That's not okay.

1845
01:54:07,810 --> 01:54:08,610
Like...

1846
01:54:08,610 --> 01:54:12,110
You gotta see a doctor if you can tank 20 fucking shotgun shots.

1847
01:54:13,390 --> 01:54:16,190
And you guys can be like, yeah, but it's like extra protection.

1848
01:54:18,710 --> 01:54:20,590
That's what the blubber is for.

1849
01:54:20,670 --> 01:54:21,810
It's like a seal blubber.

1850
01:54:22,570 --> 01:54:22,930
You know?

1851
01:54:24,910 --> 01:54:29,490
You have all that blubber to like, insulate heat and stuff, but like...

1852
01:54:29,490 --> 01:54:32,050
Eddie is like, literally a bullet vest.

1853
01:54:33,150 --> 01:54:34,490
But like, I don't think that's healthy.

1854
01:54:36,590 --> 01:54:38,570
A natural bullet vest.

1855
01:54:38,910 --> 01:54:40,890
Guys, I don't think that's healthy.

1856
01:54:44,230 --> 01:54:44,630
What?

1857
01:54:50,990 --> 01:54:53,090
Like, I think you might need to see a doctor.

1858
01:54:54,810 --> 01:54:55,210
If...

1859
01:54:55,210 --> 01:54:57,150
If your blubber... if your...

1860
01:54:57,150 --> 01:55:00,590
Your blubber can protect yourself from bullets.

1861
01:55:04,690 --> 01:55:05,090
Huh.

1862
01:55:06,870 --> 01:55:11,050
I don't have a point... I never played the original Silent Hill 2, so I don't have a point of reference of that.

1863
01:55:11,950 --> 01:55:13,950
But then it might look cool for you guys.

1864
01:55:14,070 --> 01:55:16,010
You guys might be like, oh my god, it's that thing.

1865
01:55:16,010 --> 01:55:17,310
I'm like, woah.

1866
01:55:18,850 --> 01:55:21,430
Oh, you keep... oh, come on.

1867
01:55:23,170 --> 01:55:24,030
Get up.

1868
01:55:25,130 --> 01:55:25,910
Get up.

1869
01:55:27,490 --> 01:55:28,290
Get up!

1870
01:55:36,580 --> 01:55:37,240
There we go.

1871
01:55:37,820 --> 01:55:38,680
She got up.

1872
01:55:44,790 --> 01:55:45,950
Okay, am I on the third floor?

1873
01:55:47,750 --> 01:55:48,350
Yeah!

1874
01:55:49,430 --> 01:55:50,390
I am!

1875
01:55:58,440 --> 01:55:59,980
I'm on the third floor now.

1876
01:56:00,300 --> 01:56:02,060
We're getting closer to seeing her.

1877
01:56:04,700 --> 01:56:05,540
Conference room.

1878
01:56:05,680 --> 01:56:07,860
I don't like how empty this conference room is.

1879
01:56:11,340 --> 01:56:12,780
It's way too empty.

1880
01:56:14,180 --> 01:56:15,580
It's a little freaky.

1881
01:56:20,850 --> 01:56:22,050
Can I use this?

1882
01:56:22,230 --> 01:56:23,950
Oh, I have to pick it up.

1883
01:56:27,340 --> 01:56:29,520
It says it's taking this long to get into the conference room.

1884
01:56:29,580 --> 01:56:31,360
You might as well drop by room 107.

1885
01:56:31,480 --> 01:56:32,340
I'm leaving you a key.

1886
01:56:32,540 --> 01:56:34,460
One of the guests has made quite a mess.

1887
01:56:34,960 --> 01:56:38,480
Okay, we gotta go to 107 then.

1888
01:56:40,260 --> 01:56:41,920
Time to backtrack.

1889
01:56:42,060 --> 01:56:43,540
Oh, I love backtracking.

1890
01:56:43,960 --> 01:56:44,760
Yippee!

1891
01:56:45,220 --> 01:56:46,060
Let's go!

1892
01:56:46,260 --> 01:56:47,020
Backtracking.

1893
01:56:48,440 --> 01:56:49,980
I'm gonna cry.

1894
01:56:54,900 --> 01:56:57,880
Back to backtracking.

1895
01:57:00,440 --> 01:57:01,240
What?

1896
01:57:02,020 --> 01:57:02,440
Mary?

1897
01:57:05,880 --> 01:57:06,680
Mary?

1898
01:57:11,050 --> 01:57:15,070
Oh, Mary, I know you called my name out, but I gotta explore this area first.

1899
01:57:16,250 --> 01:57:17,050
I gotta get some loot.

1900
01:57:18,410 --> 01:57:19,310
Whoa, shit!

1901
01:57:22,310 --> 01:57:23,010
What the fuck?

1902
01:57:23,030 --> 01:57:24,430
I shot you in the knee!

1903
01:57:30,090 --> 01:57:32,450
Okay, I definitely shot him in the knee there.

1904
01:57:33,450 --> 01:57:34,790
Wait, what was the bolt cutters for?

1905
01:57:35,570 --> 01:57:35,990
Oh!

1906
01:57:36,190 --> 01:57:36,790
Wait, no.

1907
01:57:41,590 --> 01:57:42,970
What was the...

1908
01:57:43,790 --> 01:57:45,450
What was the bolt cutters for?

1909
01:57:47,150 --> 01:57:48,230
Hey, good thing I'm a super chat.

1910
01:57:48,310 --> 01:57:49,030
Thank you, thank you.

1911
01:57:49,130 --> 01:57:50,190
Doki, can you check on me?

1912
01:57:50,330 --> 01:57:51,010
Wait, what's...

1913
01:57:51,010 --> 01:57:52,390
Is she playing Devil May Cry?

1914
01:57:52,570 --> 01:57:55,310
Is she being a little scaredy cat?

1915
01:58:03,220 --> 01:58:04,020
Alright, nice.

1916
01:58:06,320 --> 01:58:08,220
I wanna fucking play Silent Hill 2.

1917
01:58:13,860 --> 01:58:15,780
She's scared of Devil May Cry?

1918
01:58:26,380 --> 01:58:28,200
How do I get to over there?

1919
01:58:31,160 --> 01:58:32,480
Oh, I'm outside.

1920
01:58:33,420 --> 01:58:33,820
Yay!

1921
01:58:37,280 --> 01:58:40,620
Wait, how do I...

1922
01:58:42,540 --> 01:58:43,480
Why am I here?

1923
01:58:47,680 --> 01:58:49,320
217... Oh, I haven't been here before!

1924
01:58:55,760 --> 01:58:57,440
Oh my god, it's a bird room!

1925
01:59:10,140 --> 01:59:11,200
Wait, how do I get that?

1926
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:13,520
Oh.

1927
01:59:14,440 --> 01:59:14,960
Okay.

1928
01:59:15,820 --> 01:59:17,320
Wait, do I need another book?

1929
01:59:25,560 --> 01:59:26,040
Where am I?

1930
01:59:26,280 --> 01:59:26,880
Oh, I'm here.

1931
01:59:27,960 --> 01:59:30,480
Every time I go to a new room, I'm just like, where am I?

1932
01:59:33,020 --> 01:59:35,560
I just... I get so confused.

1933
01:59:36,220 --> 01:59:37,600
Like, so lost.

1934
01:59:38,540 --> 01:59:39,820
New room, disoriented.

1935
01:59:47,010 --> 01:59:47,530
Okay.

1936
01:59:47,530 --> 01:59:47,770
Okay.

1937
01:59:51,210 --> 01:59:52,230
Okay, smash!

1938
01:59:58,710 --> 01:59:59,850
What the fuck?

1939
02:00:00,770 --> 02:00:02,990
Oh my god, he welcomed me to his home!

1940
02:00:03,730 --> 02:00:05,250
And then I killed him.

1941
02:00:10,860 --> 02:00:13,180
We're here to find the spider nest.

1942
02:00:16,180 --> 02:00:17,120
Now where am I?

1943
02:00:17,200 --> 02:00:19,760
Okay, so we got through the employee area.

1944
02:00:22,300 --> 02:00:24,600
And then we did the vanity mirror.

1945
02:00:24,760 --> 02:00:27,360
I don't know why it's not crossed out, because we did that.

1946
02:00:31,580 --> 02:00:35,760
Oh no, the vanity mirror is the red lightbulb.

1947
02:00:38,340 --> 02:00:39,900
Did we finish the third floor?

1948
02:00:41,600 --> 02:00:42,680
Can't remember.

1949
02:00:47,570 --> 02:00:49,490
We looked at 213 already?

1950
02:00:51,070 --> 02:00:52,170
213 is locked.

1951
02:00:52,170 --> 02:00:53,030
Did

1952
02:00:56,600 --> 02:00:58,920
we finish this room?

1953
02:01:01,200 --> 02:01:02,440
Yeah, we did.

1954
02:01:04,280 --> 02:01:05,820
What happened to my items?

1955
02:01:06,280 --> 02:01:07,080
I mean...

1956
02:01:08,940 --> 02:01:11,940
Oh my god, what was the bolt cutter for?

1957
02:01:20,510 --> 02:01:23,350
Can I cut it in the conference room?

1958
02:01:25,070 --> 02:01:26,210
Is it this?

1959
02:01:28,610 --> 02:01:29,410
No.

1960
02:01:31,670 --> 02:01:33,770
Oh my god, okay, I need to use the bathroom.

1961
02:01:34,130 --> 02:01:35,730
Oh my god, my stomach.

1962
02:01:36,150 --> 02:01:42,990
I always get like, whenever I play Silent Hill, I get like so nervous and then my stomach goes like...

1963
02:01:45,010 --> 02:01:48,110
Alright, there's no way I'll die if I just look at this, right?

1964
02:01:48,830 --> 02:01:51,310
Nobody's just gonna come up and fucking shank me, right?

1965
02:01:51,410 --> 02:01:52,150
I'll be right back.

1966
02:03:10,540 --> 02:03:11,520
Oh my god, I'm safe!

1967
02:03:11,900 --> 02:03:14,120
No one came up to fucking shank me!

1968
02:03:14,120 --> 02:03:17,430
Or kick me with their sexy legs!

1969
02:03:17,960 --> 02:03:22,780
Oh my god, thank god.

1970
02:03:23,840 --> 02:03:32,420
No, the only thing I would hate so much is if a leg would just kick me just now.

1971
02:03:33,240 --> 02:03:36,500
That would be so bad if that would have happened.

1972
02:03:40,220 --> 02:03:41,800
Alright, this way.

1973
02:03:45,660 --> 02:03:47,520
I guess I have to go to the first floor?

1974
02:03:53,720 --> 02:03:56,660
I'm gonna go to the first floor, open 107.

1975
02:04:00,380 --> 02:04:01,420
Okay, save.

1976
02:04:02,720 --> 02:04:05,640
That would be so unfortunate if that happens.

1977
02:04:12,590 --> 02:04:13,630
Okay, 107.

1978
02:04:14,470 --> 02:04:16,470
107 is right here.

1979
02:04:16,930 --> 02:04:18,590
Alright, let's see who came back alive.

1980
02:04:26,060 --> 02:04:27,020
Any alivers?

1981
02:04:28,160 --> 02:04:28,760
Okay, knew it.

1982
02:04:29,720 --> 02:04:31,200
I fucking knew it!

1983
02:04:36,560 --> 02:04:39,220
Joke is they all came back alive.

1984
02:04:41,600 --> 02:04:44,180
Oh shit, he fucking headbutt me.

1985
02:04:47,540 --> 02:04:49,240
Alright, let's see.

1986
02:04:49,340 --> 02:04:50,100
107.

1987
02:04:51,620 --> 02:04:53,240
It's right here.

1988
02:04:58,510 --> 02:04:59,390
107.

1989
02:04:59,970 --> 02:05:01,770
Where the fuck is the ornament key?

1990
02:05:09,660 --> 02:05:10,540
Hello?

1991
02:05:12,380 --> 02:05:13,460
I didn't see this.

1992
02:05:15,100 --> 02:05:15,360
Hello?

1993
02:05:19,140 --> 02:05:22,900
Note to staff, and while you're at it, be sure to sweep up the leaves in the garden.

1994
02:05:23,080 --> 02:05:24,740
Then, you can get back to the fireplace.

1995
02:05:25,460 --> 02:05:27,500
Oh, am I supposed to burn it?

1996
02:05:29,580 --> 02:05:30,460
Wait, what?

1997
02:05:33,460 --> 02:05:37,720
Oh my god, these guys got fucking rowdy here.

1998
02:05:39,800 --> 02:05:42,600
Bet she's on the floor too?

1999
02:05:44,820 --> 02:05:47,080
What were they up to?

2000
02:05:53,110 --> 02:05:54,410
That's a person.

2001
02:05:58,420 --> 02:05:58,960
Butt shot.

2002
02:06:03,330 --> 02:06:05,030
Okay, she like moved her head.

2003
02:06:05,390 --> 02:06:08,050
She literally like rotated her head.

2004
02:06:13,440 --> 02:06:13,860
Hello?

2005
02:06:15,300 --> 02:06:15,740
Hello?

2006
02:06:17,100 --> 02:06:18,600
Smack you in the butt.

2007
02:06:23,140 --> 02:06:24,740
That's right, butt shot.

2008
02:06:26,540 --> 02:06:29,580
Okay, I have to make sure there's no other secret hiding guy here.

2009
02:06:32,400 --> 02:06:33,420
Wait, there's another guy.

2010
02:06:33,600 --> 02:06:34,280
I hear him.

2011
02:06:38,490 --> 02:06:38,790
Hello?

2012
02:06:39,790 --> 02:06:40,390
Hello?

2013
02:06:42,750 --> 02:06:44,190
She said hi back.

2014
02:06:44,870 --> 02:06:46,950
See, this is how you say hi.

2015
02:06:48,050 --> 02:06:51,590
Oh my god, she like actually camouflaged so well.

2016
02:06:52,170 --> 02:06:53,410
It's not fair.

2017
02:06:54,470 --> 02:06:55,830
It's not fair.

2018
02:06:55,950 --> 02:06:59,330
Oh, when I swap my Minecraft skin, I'm a tryhard.

2019
02:06:59,470 --> 02:07:02,210
But when he does it, he's just sexy.

2020
02:07:03,010 --> 02:07:04,290
It's not fair.

2021
02:07:08,890 --> 02:07:09,790
What's this?

2022
02:07:10,010 --> 02:07:10,710
Fireplace key.

2023
02:07:10,810 --> 02:07:12,410
Oh, okay, now we can get the thing.

2024
02:07:16,030 --> 02:07:17,310
Doki, please.

2025
02:07:18,510 --> 02:07:20,670
Doki, you're just projecting now.

2026
02:07:20,950 --> 02:07:21,990
No, I'm not!

2027
02:07:24,270 --> 02:07:25,590
What the fuck?

2028
02:07:25,910 --> 02:07:26,830
What is he?

2029
02:07:27,070 --> 02:07:29,250
He's like playing on the leaves.

2030
02:07:30,090 --> 02:07:31,590
Is this fun time?

2031
02:07:36,600 --> 02:07:39,260
Oh, it's like extra toxic because it's black too.

2032
02:07:39,480 --> 02:07:40,480
It's like black toxins.

2033
02:07:43,520 --> 02:07:45,100
I can't go through here.

2034
02:07:45,380 --> 02:07:46,920
Well, I got the fireplace key.

2035
02:07:53,280 --> 02:07:56,200
He's like, bro, bro, it's my fucking...

2036
02:07:56,200 --> 02:07:58,540
Bro, normally I never get free out time.

2037
02:07:58,540 --> 02:08:00,860
Bro, why you gotta do that?

2038
02:08:05,040 --> 02:08:05,880
Yeah, I'll go outside.

2039
02:08:06,020 --> 02:08:07,160
It's just faster.

2040
02:08:09,140 --> 02:08:13,160
Is there a way to go... Is there a shortcut that's faster this way?

2041
02:08:14,040 --> 02:08:15,660
No, there isn't.

2042
02:08:15,820 --> 02:08:17,080
Just fuck me, I guess.

2043
02:08:18,700 --> 02:08:20,660
Hey, what's that over there that's circled?

2044
02:08:23,380 --> 02:08:23,940
Oh!

2045
02:08:26,560 --> 02:08:28,120
That's what it was for!

2046
02:08:28,900 --> 02:08:31,040
I just never looked at it.

2047
02:08:32,120 --> 02:08:34,520
Alright, I'll go save and then we'll head outside.

2048
02:08:40,990 --> 02:08:42,430
That's the bathroom, sorry.

2049
02:08:45,590 --> 02:08:47,690
Sorry, I had to use the bathroom.

2050
02:08:48,130 --> 02:08:50,050
James had to use the bathroom too.

2051
02:08:53,230 --> 02:08:54,730
Alright, save time.

2052
02:08:58,760 --> 02:08:59,320
Alright,

2053
02:09:05,080 --> 02:09:06,040
let's go outside.

2054
02:09:06,640 --> 02:09:07,960
To the garden we go!

2055
02:09:09,300 --> 02:09:11,100
Nothing bad happens in the garden.

2056
02:09:11,200 --> 02:09:12,380
It's such a nice place.

2057
02:09:15,370 --> 02:09:17,260
Look how pretty everything is.

2058
02:09:18,300 --> 02:09:19,640
There's the lightbulb!

2059
02:09:20,040 --> 02:09:20,600
Nice.

2060
02:09:21,560 --> 02:09:23,360
Okay, we found the lightbulb.

2061
02:09:24,120 --> 02:09:25,480
Large one on the west.

2062
02:09:25,720 --> 02:09:26,060
Okay.

2063
02:09:26,800 --> 02:09:34,460
We gotta go back to the vanity, mirror, and then the fireplace, and then...

2064
02:09:34,460 --> 02:09:36,920
Oh my god, there's so many backtracks.

2065
02:09:38,920 --> 02:09:39,960
How do we get there?

2066
02:09:40,180 --> 02:09:40,920
It's up here.

2067
02:09:42,380 --> 02:09:43,740
And then we go up.

2068
02:09:45,520 --> 02:09:48,440
James, why couldn't you just leave everything in one area?

2069
02:09:48,600 --> 02:09:49,360
I don't understand.

2070
02:09:52,560 --> 02:09:57,920
Why didn't it be so fun and everything was very conveniently placed in locations where...

2071
02:09:57,920 --> 02:10:01,200
You know, I can just go there and it'll be fine?

2072
02:10:02,320 --> 02:10:03,440
Or is that silly?

2073
02:10:08,290 --> 02:10:09,330
Mirror first.

2074
02:10:14,900 --> 02:10:15,420
Lightbulb.

2075
02:10:15,640 --> 02:10:16,220
Wait, what?

2076
02:10:19,020 --> 02:10:19,840
Wait, what?

2077
02:10:21,100 --> 02:10:22,300
Is it because it's not red?

2078
02:10:22,760 --> 02:10:24,100
How do I make this lightbulb red?

2079
02:10:29,260 --> 02:10:29,820
Wait.

2080
02:10:34,020 --> 02:10:35,440
How do I make it red?

2081
02:10:40,030 --> 02:10:41,570
It's not red though.

2082
02:10:43,450 --> 02:10:45,050
What if I bleed on it?

2083
02:10:45,650 --> 02:10:49,950
What if I chew my foot and then bleed on the lightbulb?

2084
02:10:52,990 --> 02:10:53,990
Does that work?

2085
02:11:00,140 --> 02:11:02,940
Okay, fireplace is... okay, we gotta go this way.

2086
02:11:06,530 --> 02:11:08,850
It's okay, it's just a little blood.

2087
02:11:15,120 --> 02:11:18,460
How else would I solve the puzzle if I don't bleed on it?

2088
02:11:25,820 --> 02:11:28,800
It's like the most easiest solution, James.

2089
02:11:28,980 --> 02:11:31,120
We don't need to find anything else.

2090
02:11:36,040 --> 02:11:36,840
Fireplace key.

2091
02:11:37,580 --> 02:11:39,380
I still don't know what to do with these.

2092
02:11:44,740 --> 02:11:45,860
What happened?

2093
02:11:48,960 --> 02:11:49,820
Pyramid head?

2094
02:11:51,660 --> 02:11:52,880
Is that you?

2095
02:12:06,410 --> 02:12:08,010
Oh, is that boss?

2096
02:12:08,230 --> 02:12:10,190
Wait, wait, guys, guys, is this a boss?

2097
02:12:17,220 --> 02:12:18,420
Guys, is he a boss?

2098
02:12:18,480 --> 02:12:19,340
Okay, that's fine.

2099
02:12:20,420 --> 02:12:22,020
Oh shit, it's not fine.

2100
02:12:24,500 --> 02:12:25,760
Okay, now I know.

2101
02:12:33,420 --> 02:12:34,780
Oh god, oh god.

2102
02:12:44,620 --> 02:12:45,220
Whoa!

2103
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:46,600
Oh,

2104
02:12:50,200 --> 02:12:51,740
he fucking flings himself?

2105
02:12:56,080 --> 02:12:57,460
Wait, he wasn't a boss.

2106
02:12:57,600 --> 02:12:58,580
He was so easy to kill.

2107
02:13:00,280 --> 02:13:01,340
Is he dead?

2108
02:13:03,540 --> 02:13:04,880
Wait, that's it?

2109
02:13:06,880 --> 02:13:07,780
That's it?

2110
02:13:09,940 --> 02:13:10,540
What?

2111
02:13:16,570 --> 02:13:18,790
What the fuck, you're so fucking weak.

2112
02:13:18,830 --> 02:13:19,770
You're such a loser.

2113
02:13:20,390 --> 02:13:24,790
Bro, all the other bosses were actually hard for you to...

2114
02:13:24,790 --> 02:13:26,150
And he was harder than you.

2115
02:13:26,230 --> 02:13:28,510
Like, what the fuck is wrong with you?

2116
02:13:29,170 --> 02:13:30,490
And he was harder.

2117
02:13:30,990 --> 02:13:32,670
And he's like a mad.

2118
02:13:33,430 --> 02:13:35,950
You're like supposed to be like my dirty thoughts.

2119
02:13:40,230 --> 02:13:42,050
Oh, it's just a mini boss?

2120
02:13:42,190 --> 02:13:44,030
Okay, okay.

2121
02:13:46,030 --> 02:13:47,350
Why does he look like that?

2122
02:13:47,410 --> 02:13:48,450
Because I'm lonely.

2123
02:13:54,630 --> 02:13:55,430
What?

2124
02:13:55,430 --> 02:13:57,610
You'll understand if you're also lonely.

2125
02:13:58,430 --> 02:14:00,470
You just don't understand.

2126
02:14:07,720 --> 02:14:09,840
Alright, here we go.

2127
02:14:14,400 --> 02:14:16,580
Yay, we're on the other side now.

2128
02:14:22,930 --> 02:14:24,490
Doki is already on the ground.

2129
02:14:24,670 --> 02:14:27,030
Wasn't the other guy chilling on the ground enough?

2130
02:14:27,350 --> 02:14:29,910
Thank you for the super chat, Momohaku.

2131
02:14:30,350 --> 02:14:31,330
Thank you, thank you.

2132
02:14:35,060 --> 02:14:35,980
I don't need help.

2133
02:14:36,040 --> 02:14:37,780
I just need Mary, who's very much alive.

2134
02:14:41,510 --> 02:14:44,270
Can I dip my lightbulb onto this blood?

2135
02:14:45,190 --> 02:14:46,310
Oh yeah, I can!

2136
02:14:50,110 --> 02:14:51,130
Okay, and then...

2137
02:14:52,150 --> 02:14:55,090
James, you need to clean those afterwards.

2138
02:14:55,690 --> 02:14:57,850
Lostcore, thank you for the super chat.

2139
02:14:57,990 --> 02:14:59,110
Thank you, thank you.

2140
02:15:00,570 --> 02:15:01,730
Okay, now it's red.

2141
02:15:02,590 --> 02:15:03,410
Wait, what?

2142
02:15:04,570 --> 02:15:05,930
It cannot be opened?

2143
02:15:10,270 --> 02:15:10,790
Wait.

2144
02:15:15,240 --> 02:15:16,120
Where is it?

2145
02:15:16,220 --> 02:15:17,720
Where's my fucking key items?

2146
02:15:21,440 --> 02:15:23,120
Oh my god, I can't open.

2147
02:15:23,360 --> 02:15:24,720
I'll use my key.

2148
02:15:26,880 --> 02:15:29,980
I should be, like, allowed to use my key to open this.

2149
02:15:31,360 --> 02:15:32,440
Where do I go?

2150
02:15:37,950 --> 02:15:40,630
Yeah, I should be allowed to use my key to open this.

2151
02:15:43,630 --> 02:15:45,770
Where the fuck do I go now?

2152
02:15:54,280 --> 02:15:58,480
Like, I have a music box, but, like...

2153
02:16:00,610 --> 02:16:02,630
Oh, the key item I shot down.

2154
02:16:02,670 --> 02:16:04,190
You're right, I forgot about that.

2155
02:16:05,850 --> 02:16:07,430
Where did I shoot it down, though?

2156
02:16:07,490 --> 02:16:08,330
That's the thing.

2157
02:16:12,120 --> 02:16:13,900
Guys, where did I shoot that thing down?

2158
02:16:20,570 --> 02:16:22,150
I forgot about that item.

2159
02:16:22,510 --> 02:16:24,650
That, like, never existed to me.

2160
02:16:26,850 --> 02:16:28,590
It's not marked in my map.

2161
02:16:31,990 --> 02:16:34,790
I definitely know I did not shoot a can opener, though.

2162
02:16:37,960 --> 02:16:40,860
I should just put the paint on the ground and then just shoot it.

2163
02:16:40,860 --> 02:16:44,080
I just need a hole to dip a light bulb in.

2164
02:16:44,340 --> 02:16:45,580
That's literally it.

2165
02:16:48,520 --> 02:16:49,620
That's the bathroom.

2166
02:16:50,720 --> 02:16:52,200
Fuck, it's the piano room.

2167
02:16:52,440 --> 02:16:54,240
Okay, it's there, like, shorty restaurant.

2168
02:16:54,360 --> 02:16:55,000
It's a restaurant.

2169
02:17:04,540 --> 02:17:05,340
There we go.

2170
02:17:05,560 --> 02:17:06,800
That's where I shot it.

2171
02:17:07,840 --> 02:17:09,140
Oh, there it is!

2172
02:17:10,840 --> 02:17:12,160
There's the can opener.

2173
02:17:14,700 --> 02:17:15,920
Oh, thank god.

2174
02:17:18,780 --> 02:17:21,020
And then, the light bulb.

2175
02:17:21,820 --> 02:17:23,540
There we go, it's finally red.

2176
02:17:25,540 --> 02:17:27,240
Thank fucking god.

2177
02:17:29,600 --> 02:17:31,300
Alright, we gotta...

2178
02:17:33,740 --> 02:17:42,240
We gotta save, then put the light on the thing, and then do the vanity mirror, and then find my tape.

2179
02:17:42,540 --> 02:17:44,140
I still remember about the tape.

2180
02:17:47,280 --> 02:17:55,440
Who opens a can- I'm- He lost- He is trying to find his wife now, and you're gonna- He has been- James has been through a lot.

2181
02:17:55,820 --> 02:17:58,700
And you're gonna judge him for his can opening?

2182
02:18:00,280 --> 02:18:01,860
I fucking knew you were alive.

2183
02:18:02,920 --> 02:18:03,760
I knew it.

2184
02:18:04,260 --> 02:18:06,460
Get down from here, you fucking whore.

2185
02:18:08,360 --> 02:18:09,760
Or I'll just do the mirror.

2186
02:18:16,160 --> 02:18:16,560
Alright.

2187
02:18:19,760 --> 02:18:20,700
Deed done.

2188
02:18:21,140 --> 02:18:21,660
Is that it?

2189
02:18:26,320 --> 02:18:27,120
Deed...

2190
02:18:29,160 --> 02:18:31,940
What happens if I like, skip all that?

2191
02:18:36,510 --> 02:18:37,310
Like...

2192
02:18:38,410 --> 02:18:45,750
If I just put deed done, without going through like, 30 minutes of all that puzzle?

2193
02:18:48,430 --> 02:18:49,630
Employee elevator.

2194
02:18:49,750 --> 02:18:50,290
Okay.

2195
02:18:55,200 --> 02:18:57,420
I'm gonna save it.

2196
02:19:10,820 --> 02:19:11,840
Elevator's right here.

2197
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:13,540
Alright, I'm not dealing with the spiders.

2198
02:19:14,580 --> 02:19:17,620
I'm not- I have more important things to worry about right now.

2199
02:19:17,740 --> 02:19:18,720
I can't...

2200
02:19:19,320 --> 02:19:21,120
I can't deal with them again.

2201
02:19:21,540 --> 02:19:22,400
Not again.

2202
02:19:29,470 --> 02:19:30,470
Oh hey, I saved.

2203
02:19:33,760 --> 02:19:35,580
Oh my god, am I close to the end?

2204
02:19:35,940 --> 02:19:37,940
I feel like I've been playing for 20 years.

2205
02:19:39,060 --> 02:19:42,800
I've been stuck in Silent Hill for so long.

2206
02:19:43,640 --> 02:19:45,980
I don't even know if I'm making good progress.

2207
02:19:46,220 --> 02:19:47,620
Wait, why do we store items?

2208
02:19:50,400 --> 02:19:51,240
Wait, what?

2209
02:19:54,320 --> 02:19:54,760
What?

2210
02:19:57,420 --> 02:19:59,300
Why would I want to store items?

2211
02:20:03,410 --> 02:20:04,750
Wait, I don't understand.

2212
02:20:05,630 --> 02:20:07,530
I- I don't understand.

2213
02:20:08,510 --> 02:20:12,990
I- I don't like- Wait, what?

2214
02:20:17,810 --> 02:20:19,470
I just put my books down?

2215
02:20:36,800 --> 02:20:37,280
Okay.

2216
02:20:51,100 --> 02:20:51,580
James.

2217
02:20:52,360 --> 02:20:55,160
We should've went on- we should've lifted- we should've went on a diet, James.

2218
02:20:58,120 --> 02:21:01,520
We should've- and not just pick up one pistol.

2219
02:21:01,920 --> 02:21:03,080
Just one pistol.

2220
02:21:03,420 --> 02:21:05,240
Just let me hold my pistol, please.

2221
02:21:05,340 --> 02:21:10,740
Like, that's- Like, there's no way one pistol.

2222
02:21:10,940 --> 02:21:12,900
I can't even hold the pistol.

2223
02:21:14,220 --> 02:21:15,540
James, we're too thick.

2224
02:21:15,740 --> 02:21:17,840
We're too thick, James.

2225
02:21:17,980 --> 02:21:19,220
We're too thick.

2226
02:21:23,180 --> 02:21:23,780
James.

2227
02:21:27,960 --> 02:21:30,460
Oh no, I see him.

2228
02:21:36,220 --> 02:21:38,640
Like, where am I supposed to go?

2229
02:21:44,800 --> 02:21:46,020
Oh, this is it.

2230
02:21:48,400 --> 02:21:49,120
Wait.

2231
02:21:50,160 --> 02:21:50,840
4-1.

2232
02:21:55,380 --> 02:21:56,820
What was it?

2233
02:21:57,640 --> 02:21:58,660
No, I don't remember.

2234
02:21:58,980 --> 02:22:00,460
It was 20 years ago.

2235
02:22:01,300 --> 02:22:03,420
I'm fucking- where's my notes?

2236
02:22:03,780 --> 02:22:04,790
Where's my notes?

2237
02:22:05,680 --> 02:22:06,640
4-1 something.

2238
02:22:06,840 --> 02:22:08,020
It was 4-1 something.

2239
02:22:08,440 --> 02:22:09,060
No.

2240
02:22:09,480 --> 02:22:11,000
No, it overwrote.

2241
02:22:11,460 --> 02:22:11,800
No!

2242
02:22:14,120 --> 02:22:16,560
I don't see it no more!

2243
02:22:17,700 --> 02:22:18,830
It got overwritten.

2244
02:22:20,120 --> 02:22:23,520
4-1-1-4.

2245
02:22:27,560 --> 02:22:29,560
4-1-4.

2246
02:22:30,460 --> 02:22:33,900
4- No, please.

2247
02:22:34,120 --> 02:22:35,440
Please, I need my tapes.

2248
02:22:36,040 --> 02:22:42,080
4- 4-1-1-4.

2249
02:22:42,600 --> 02:22:47,220
4-4-4-1-4-1-7.

2250
02:22:47,820 --> 02:22:49,540
I knew it started with a 4!

2251
02:22:51,780 --> 02:22:57,700
4-4-3-4-2- That's all I remember!

2252
02:23:01,320 --> 02:23:02,520
No.

2253
02:23:02,820 --> 02:23:03,320
No.

2254
02:23:03,720 --> 02:23:04,220
No.

2255
02:23:04,660 --> 02:23:05,220
No.

2256
02:23:05,940 --> 02:23:06,880
No.

2257
02:23:07,560 --> 02:23:08,280
No.

2258
02:23:09,140 --> 02:23:09,580
No.

2259
02:23:16,880 --> 02:23:26,560
4-1- 7-4-4-7-4-1-4.

2260
02:23:26,880 --> 02:23:27,700
I

2261
02:23:32,240 --> 02:23:34,420
did it.

2262
02:23:36,800 --> 02:23:38,260
I don't know where to go now.

2263
02:23:38,560 --> 02:23:40,320
I didn't think I'd make it this far.

2264
02:23:43,300 --> 02:23:45,060
Like, what do I do here?

2265
02:23:45,960 --> 02:23:52,740
What do I do here?

2266
02:23:54,480 --> 02:23:56,780
Just won't wash off water sheets.

2267
02:24:01,380 --> 02:24:02,340
Oh, the video.

2268
02:24:03,180 --> 02:24:04,360
You wanna watch a video with me?

2269
02:24:04,640 --> 02:24:05,640
It's a freaky video.

2270
02:24:08,520 --> 02:24:10,480
How do I watch the freaky video?

2271
02:24:11,720 --> 02:24:12,900
Oh, there's a map.

2272
02:24:14,820 --> 02:24:15,280
Okay.

2273
02:24:16,780 --> 02:24:18,260
TV room.

2274
02:24:19,760 --> 02:24:21,180
How do I get out?

2275
02:24:25,030 --> 02:24:26,790
The fuck do I leave?

2276
02:24:35,230 --> 02:24:37,270
How do I leave this area?

2277
02:24:37,270 --> 02:24:37,410
Yeah.

2278
02:24:48,640 --> 02:24:49,600
Hey there.

2279
02:24:52,280 --> 02:24:52,920
Goodbye.

2280
02:24:57,820 --> 02:24:59,540
It's nice seeing you, bro.

2281
02:25:03,430 --> 02:25:04,970
Cool seeing you there.

2282
02:25:13,680 --> 02:25:14,320
Bye.

2283
02:25:16,300 --> 02:25:18,580
Wait, can I come back there with my gun?

2284
02:25:23,420 --> 02:25:26,160
Can I go back there with my gun and kill him?

2285
02:25:37,870 --> 02:25:40,050
Bro, I can't even fight him!

2286
02:25:41,330 --> 02:25:42,830
I can't do anything!

2287
02:25:49,050 --> 02:25:50,290
How do I get out?

2288
02:25:52,930 --> 02:25:53,610
Wait.

2289
02:25:59,800 --> 02:26:01,560
I don't like this guy.

2290
02:26:12,180 --> 02:26:13,700
I don't like him.

2291
02:26:20,460 --> 02:26:22,240
Oh my god.

2292
02:26:22,520 --> 02:26:23,940
I hate this area.

2293
02:26:24,340 --> 02:26:28,300
I hate this area so fucking much!

2294
02:26:31,940 --> 02:26:32,640
Okay.

2295
02:26:33,120 --> 02:26:36,720
We gotta go to the maintenance room and grab the thing.

2296
02:26:43,820 --> 02:26:44,520
Hey.

2297
02:26:45,140 --> 02:26:45,840
Goodbye.

2298
02:26:52,000 --> 02:26:52,720
Bro, I'm running.

2299
02:26:52,940 --> 02:26:55,300
I'm running as fast as I can, man.

2300
02:26:55,380 --> 02:26:57,500
I'm running as fast as I can!

2301
02:26:58,360 --> 02:27:01,560
I'm sorry for calling you weak earlier.

2302
02:27:01,720 --> 02:27:03,360
I didn't mean it.

2303
02:27:04,020 --> 02:27:06,760
I'm sorry for calling your brother weak.

2304
02:27:07,040 --> 02:27:09,220
You're so much cooler than your brother.

2305
02:27:16,050 --> 02:27:23,110
If I knew you guys had siblings, I wouldn't have done it.

2306
02:27:28,320 --> 02:27:29,080
Okay.

2307
02:27:30,200 --> 02:27:30,840
Spin.

2308
02:27:30,840 --> 02:27:31,360
Spin.

2309
02:27:31,360 --> 02:27:32,420
Spin.

2310
02:27:34,680 --> 02:27:35,360
Spin!

2311
02:27:42,190 --> 02:27:44,270
I don't even have flashlights.

2312
02:27:56,840 --> 02:27:57,180
What?

2313
02:27:58,240 --> 02:27:59,280
Is it here?

2314
02:28:08,300 --> 02:28:09,360
Okay.

2315
02:28:11,280 --> 02:28:12,540
Take it back.

2316
02:28:14,460 --> 02:28:16,140
Spin to live.

2317
02:28:17,520 --> 02:28:18,200
Spin!

2318
02:28:19,000 --> 02:28:20,200
Just keep spinning!

2319
02:28:21,360 --> 02:28:22,200
Spin!

2320
02:28:24,440 --> 02:28:25,280
Spin!

2321
02:28:28,340 --> 02:28:30,240
Come on, James!

2322
02:28:30,400 --> 02:28:31,200
Just spin!

2323
02:28:35,840 --> 02:28:36,460
Hello.

2324
02:28:37,280 --> 02:28:38,100
Oh no.

2325
02:28:38,780 --> 02:28:39,160
Wait.

2326
02:28:39,940 --> 02:28:41,320
Is this when I got angry?

2327
02:28:42,860 --> 02:28:44,800
No, this is a different place.

2328
02:28:50,590 --> 02:28:52,470
Oh my god.

2329
02:28:52,490 --> 02:28:53,670
My heart is like thumping.

2330
02:28:54,530 --> 02:28:56,290
Oh hey, there's another one.

2331
02:28:56,370 --> 02:28:57,410
Oh, she's cute.

2332
02:28:57,550 --> 02:28:58,390
It's a little mermaid.

2333
02:29:00,770 --> 02:29:02,370
Can I grab my stuff back?

2334
02:29:07,370 --> 02:29:07,790
Hello?

2335
02:29:08,970 --> 02:29:10,270
Where is this area?

2336
02:29:12,470 --> 02:29:13,590
Oh, it's the basement.

2337
02:29:13,750 --> 02:29:14,210
It's the basement.

2338
02:29:14,350 --> 02:29:14,890
It's the basement.

2339
02:29:21,610 --> 02:29:25,110
Guys, where did I leave my...

2340
02:29:27,710 --> 02:29:29,190
Where did I leave my stuff?

2341
02:29:30,270 --> 02:29:31,790
I don't remember.

2342
02:29:32,170 --> 02:29:35,850
I don't remember where I left my stuff.

2343
02:29:37,130 --> 02:29:38,690
Was it in the basement?

2344
02:29:40,130 --> 02:29:41,830
It's been so long.

2345
02:29:50,500 --> 02:29:51,100
Notice that.

2346
02:29:51,220 --> 02:29:53,580
Be sure to clean up the fireplace in the conference room.

2347
02:29:54,480 --> 02:29:56,000
Oh my god, where was it?

2348
02:30:00,700 --> 02:30:02,000
Wasn't there a shortcut?

2349
02:30:06,500 --> 02:30:08,540
Oh, second floor to the left.

2350
02:30:09,480 --> 02:30:11,600
Guys, they took away my map.

2351
02:30:12,080 --> 02:30:17,900
They took away the one thing that was keeping me alive.

2352
02:30:18,480 --> 02:30:19,520
My map.

2353
02:30:27,040 --> 02:30:27,820
Oh, thank god.

2354
02:30:38,290 --> 02:30:39,870
Oh, I got everything back.

2355
02:30:40,030 --> 02:30:41,590
Thank fucking god.

2356
02:30:49,910 --> 02:30:53,150
Did I really need a cutscene of me picking my stuff up?

2357
02:30:54,810 --> 02:30:55,890
That's it?

2358
02:30:55,890 --> 02:30:59,650
Why did I need a cutscene for that?

2359
02:31:06,240 --> 02:31:06,630
What?

2360
02:31:10,260 --> 02:31:11,500
Absolute cinema.

2361
02:31:11,680 --> 02:31:14,440
That was the best cutscene I've ever seen, chat.

2362
02:31:19,540 --> 02:31:22,960
I feel so fucking immersed now.

2363
02:31:23,360 --> 02:31:25,000
What do I do now?

2364
02:31:30,900 --> 02:31:34,440
That peek was so vital to the plot, Doki.

2365
02:31:34,520 --> 02:31:35,460
You don't understand.

2366
02:31:38,660 --> 02:31:41,840
Wait, what am I supposed to do?

2367
02:31:42,000 --> 02:31:44,640
I never found the item for the music box.

2368
02:31:47,160 --> 02:31:47,460
I

2369
02:31:52,770 --> 02:31:57,170
don't think I ever found the item for it.

2370
02:31:59,530 --> 02:32:00,550
Wait, I did?

2371
02:32:01,270 --> 02:32:03,570
Like, I never found, like, where to put it in.

2372
02:32:03,830 --> 02:32:04,570
It's at the end?

2373
02:32:04,810 --> 02:32:05,910
Oh, shit!

2374
02:32:06,010 --> 02:32:07,530
Is that what it was?

2375
02:32:07,830 --> 02:32:09,250
I thought that was decoration.

2376
02:32:10,130 --> 02:32:13,450
I didn't realize that was... Oh, there it is.

2377
02:32:14,890 --> 02:32:17,950
I didn't realize that was, like, part of the game.

2378
02:32:18,870 --> 02:32:20,750
I thought it was just to decorate it.

2379
02:32:24,250 --> 02:32:24,730
Alright.

2380
02:32:25,530 --> 02:32:26,290
Found it.

2381
02:32:34,960 --> 02:32:37,140
Okay, mermaid in there.

2382
02:32:50,610 --> 02:32:51,890
That's correct.

2383
02:32:57,120 --> 02:32:58,780
Is it moving this?

2384
02:33:09,130 --> 02:33:10,390
Okay, that's correct.

2385
02:33:10,510 --> 02:33:11,470
That's not correct, sorry.

2386
02:33:11,690 --> 02:33:12,970
That's correct.

2387
02:33:16,530 --> 02:33:17,450
There we go.

2388
02:33:18,110 --> 02:33:18,850
That should be it.

2389
02:33:21,070 --> 02:33:22,770
Okay, but this is correct now.

2390
02:33:26,360 --> 02:33:27,300
Is it not?

2391
02:33:33,900 --> 02:33:38,750
Oh, I'm so dumb.

2392
02:33:42,410 --> 02:33:44,850
But it's not moving it, though.

2393
02:33:59,300 --> 02:34:02,380
Cuz that's correct, cuz it hits everything here.

2394
02:34:11,370 --> 02:34:12,890
Guys, I just figured it out.

2395
02:34:13,390 --> 02:34:15,210
I was so confused about the center.

2396
02:34:22,390 --> 02:34:25,790
Oh my god, I didn't realize the center was its own thing.

2397
02:34:38,040 --> 02:34:40,100
How the fuck do we do this part?

2398
02:34:47,480 --> 02:34:48,800
I'm so stupid.

2399
02:34:53,340 --> 02:34:55,480
Cuz how do we connect that to there?

2400
02:35:11,500 --> 02:35:13,960
Okay, that's connected now.

2401
02:35:19,840 --> 02:35:22,080
That should all be connected here.

2402
02:35:23,060 --> 02:35:23,920
Is that it?

2403
02:35:38,350 --> 02:35:41,750
How the fuck do I connect these guys?

2404
02:35:51,930 --> 02:35:53,490
We did it.

2405
02:36:07,690 --> 02:36:08,370
What?

2406
02:36:14,810 --> 02:36:16,170
I'm confused.

2407
02:36:16,430 --> 02:36:18,210
Wait, what does it all do?

2408
02:36:19,810 --> 02:36:20,430
What?

2409
02:36:21,310 --> 02:36:22,630
If I press it, what happens?

2410
02:36:36,500 --> 02:36:36,840
What?

2411
02:36:36,840 --> 02:36:37,820
What?

2412
02:36:37,820 --> 02:36:39,620
What begins with 3?

2413
02:36:40,420 --> 02:36:41,020
1?

2414
02:36:45,040 --> 02:36:46,800
The phase 2?

2415
02:36:50,150 --> 02:36:51,650
What begins with 3?

2416
02:36:51,790 --> 02:36:53,170
1 would soon deploy.

2417
02:36:53,830 --> 02:36:57,830
7 kindly souls, open the door.

2418
02:37:05,390 --> 02:37:09,230
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7?

2419
02:37:10,330 --> 02:37:13,430
1, 2, 3, 4, 5?

2420
02:37:13,830 --> 02:37:15,390
7, 5, 1?

2421
02:37:16,090 --> 02:37:16,650
1.

2422
02:37:17,570 --> 02:37:18,130
Oh!

2423
02:37:28,180 --> 02:37:29,520
I did it!

2424
02:37:31,660 --> 02:37:34,280
Cuz at the end, it's like 7, 5, 1.

2425
02:37:35,940 --> 02:37:37,000
What the fuck?

2426
02:37:37,280 --> 02:37:38,540
Okay, I figured it out.

2427
02:37:39,720 --> 02:37:40,880
I'm so smart.

2428
02:37:42,540 --> 02:37:45,040
I thought it was like, that says 7.

2429
02:37:45,700 --> 02:37:47,460
The other one says 5.

2430
02:37:48,100 --> 02:37:49,860
And the last one said 1.

2431
02:37:50,640 --> 02:37:51,300
Is that it?

2432
02:37:56,780 --> 02:37:58,720
I was like, okay.

2433
02:38:00,420 --> 02:38:01,380
Third floor.

2434
02:38:03,840 --> 02:38:05,480
How do I get to the third floor?

2435
02:38:06,380 --> 02:38:07,440
Is it this way?

2436
02:38:14,850 --> 02:38:15,950
I think it's this way.

2437
02:38:23,150 --> 02:38:24,270
And then...

2438
02:38:24,270 --> 02:38:25,650
Wait, what?

2439
02:38:31,990 --> 02:38:33,330
Oh, I figured it out.

2440
02:38:34,370 --> 02:38:35,790
Wait, no, that goes downstairs.

2441
02:38:37,450 --> 02:38:38,290
This way.

2442
02:38:40,750 --> 02:38:42,270
Now I'm on the third floor.

2443
02:38:46,110 --> 02:38:47,650
And there's a padlock.

2444
02:38:51,470 --> 02:38:53,030
Mary, I'm coming over, Mary!

2445
02:38:54,010 --> 02:38:54,950
This is it, Mary!

2446
02:38:55,930 --> 02:38:56,390
I'm

2447
02:39:02,360 --> 02:39:04,420
coming over for the ghost booty call, Mary!

2448
02:39:08,540 --> 02:39:09,620
Wait, what's this?

2449
02:39:11,240 --> 02:39:12,440
Observation room?

2450
02:39:13,120 --> 02:39:14,940
Who's gonna be observing us?

2451
02:39:18,690 --> 02:39:19,370
Mary?

2452
02:39:19,810 --> 02:39:20,950
Who did you invite?

2453
02:39:26,340 --> 02:39:26,920
Mary!

2454
02:39:27,740 --> 02:39:28,260
Mary?

2455
02:39:29,980 --> 02:39:32,200
Mary, where are you?

2456
02:39:34,680 --> 02:39:35,360
Mary?

2457
02:39:37,420 --> 02:39:39,280
Mary, it's been three years, Mary.

2458
02:39:39,420 --> 02:39:42,300
I have not done anything for three years.

2459
02:39:48,460 --> 02:39:49,660
She's not dead.

2460
02:39:49,760 --> 02:39:50,760
It was all fake.

2461
02:39:51,520 --> 02:39:53,620
She faked her own death, guys.

2462
02:40:08,940 --> 02:40:09,500
Boo.

2463
02:40:12,710 --> 02:40:14,020
What's the video?

2464
02:40:15,740 --> 02:40:16,060
Mary?

2465
02:40:19,700 --> 02:40:21,560
Yeah, I gotta prepare for tonight.

2466
02:40:52,540 --> 02:40:53,220
Why?

2467
02:40:53,920 --> 02:40:55,160
There's no view.

2468
02:40:55,560 --> 02:40:56,680
It's just fog.

2469
02:41:03,060 --> 02:41:04,720
Why don't we just move here?

2470
02:41:05,040 --> 02:41:06,960
We love Silent Hill so much.

2471
02:41:07,980 --> 02:41:08,140
Huh?

2472
02:41:18,050 --> 02:41:18,430
Huh?

2473
02:41:31,400 --> 02:41:34,480
Like, Kierman had overrated my video with thirst traps?

2474
02:41:56,090 --> 02:41:57,730
Did I kill Mary?

2475
02:42:11,760 --> 02:42:14,740
I fucking smothered her?

2476
02:42:50,610 --> 02:42:54,910
I didn't want to take care of her anymore, so I killed her.

2477
02:42:56,950 --> 02:42:59,010
Look, we live in America, Laura.

2478
02:42:59,530 --> 02:43:00,410
You gotta understand.

2479
02:43:01,030 --> 02:43:03,250
Like, those bills were getting way too high.

2480
02:43:24,920 --> 02:43:27,320
Look, our insurance didn't cover it, Laura!

2481
02:43:27,580 --> 02:43:29,780
Our insurance couldn't cover it!

2482
02:43:38,400 --> 02:43:39,380
I'm sorry.

2483
02:43:43,230 --> 02:43:44,850
Mary, you know, isn't here.

2484
02:43:57,340 --> 02:43:59,140
Oh my god, what?

2485
02:43:59,740 --> 02:44:01,720
Wait, why did I kill her?

2486
02:44:05,170 --> 02:44:06,530
Well, thank you for the superchat, thank you.

2487
02:44:06,970 --> 02:44:10,030
Dog mask makes the scene peak.

2488
02:44:10,790 --> 02:44:12,170
Oh no, I'm in the other world.

2489
02:44:12,330 --> 02:44:12,910
Oh no.

2490
02:44:18,570 --> 02:44:19,130
Mary?

2491
02:44:27,860 --> 02:44:29,380
I'm so tired.

2492
02:44:30,820 --> 02:44:33,040
I'm so tired, Mary.

2493
02:44:38,240 --> 02:44:40,960
You were sick, but like, it wasn't terminal.

2494
02:44:42,360 --> 02:44:44,960
So I had to make it terminal.

2495
02:45:00,610 --> 02:45:02,210
I thought that was Kierman head.

2496
02:45:02,290 --> 02:45:05,550
I didn't realize that was me choking her or smothering her to death.

2497
02:45:06,910 --> 02:45:10,950
I was like, is that Kierman head making a thirst trap right now over my wife's video?

2498
02:45:10,950 --> 02:45:13,350
But no, it was me making a thirst trap.

2499
02:45:13,630 --> 02:45:15,370
Or not thirst trap, trying to kill her.

2500
02:45:19,200 --> 02:45:20,960
What room did she say she was in?

2501
02:45:25,080 --> 02:45:26,700
Wait, that was the other world?

2502
02:45:26,840 --> 02:45:28,140
This is the real hotel?

2503
02:45:48,390 --> 02:45:49,710
Go the other way?

2504
02:45:50,330 --> 02:45:51,290
Oh no, it's this way.

2505
02:45:58,790 --> 02:46:01,690
Wait, then what the fuck, then Laura was running around here!

2506
02:46:06,600 --> 02:46:11,580
Laura didn't find it weird that we were running around this burned down hotel?

2507
02:46:16,480 --> 02:46:18,180
Laura, you have some issues.

2508
02:46:18,280 --> 02:46:20,880
I know you're an orphan, but like, this is bad.

2509
02:46:39,470 --> 02:46:40,210
What the fuck?

2510
02:46:42,070 --> 02:46:43,190
I don't know where I'm going.

2511
02:46:44,970 --> 02:46:46,690
There's so many holes.

2512
02:46:51,420 --> 02:46:53,460
I've never been so lost.

2513
02:47:01,980 --> 02:47:02,600
Okay.

2514
02:47:08,620 --> 02:47:09,940
Now I'm here.

2515
02:47:21,230 --> 02:47:22,410
Is this way?

2516
02:47:27,320 --> 02:47:29,500
What's the point of the loop-de-loop there?

2517
02:47:42,400 --> 02:47:43,600
Where am I now?

2518
02:47:43,920 --> 02:47:45,880
Wait, there's a question mark behind me.

2519
02:47:46,900 --> 02:47:48,440
Then there's a hole here.

2520
02:48:00,060 --> 02:48:02,920
See, it's because I stopped taking my meds.

2521
02:48:03,540 --> 02:48:07,420
I mean, it's because I started taking my meds, so I started remembering things again.

2522
02:48:09,000 --> 02:48:13,820
When I didn't take my meds, I was in full denial and I was happy.

2523
02:48:14,640 --> 02:48:18,260
I was happy that I didn't kill my- thinking that I didn't kill my wife.

2524
02:48:24,120 --> 02:48:25,700
What am I supposed to do with this?

2525
02:48:34,150 --> 02:48:35,690
Still can't get it right.

2526
02:48:42,620 --> 02:48:45,040
Is there like a crevice here?

2527
02:48:49,220 --> 02:48:51,040
Oh, there it is.

2528
02:48:52,380 --> 02:48:55,060
Okay, let me check what's on the other side first.

2529
02:49:01,580 --> 02:49:03,040
What does that say?

2530
02:49:04,520 --> 02:49:08,480
There's no healing of the- thy bruise, thy wound is grievous.

2531
02:49:17,340 --> 02:49:19,280
Okay, we got more ammo.

2532
02:49:22,940 --> 02:49:25,360
Alright, time to push this thing over.

2533
02:49:28,600 --> 02:49:29,300
Weeee!

2534
02:49:40,140 --> 02:49:41,260
Okay, nice.

2535
02:49:45,550 --> 02:49:46,250
Oh.

2536
02:49:48,460 --> 02:49:50,430
Oh, I guess it's time to jump down again.

2537
02:49:50,690 --> 02:49:51,990
Back to the hole we go.

2538
02:49:52,750 --> 02:49:54,310
Back to another hole!

2539
02:50:00,080 --> 02:50:00,780
Yeah!

2540
02:50:01,300 --> 02:50:03,520
Of course I have to go down another hole.

2541
02:50:13,670 --> 02:50:15,530
The holes never stop.

2542
02:50:18,410 --> 02:50:20,650
We have to fight Pyramid Head soon.

2543
02:50:22,650 --> 02:50:24,750
This feels very Pyramid Head-ish.

2544
02:50:36,600 --> 02:50:40,560
Oh, it's not a problem if the game keeps enabling me.

2545
02:50:44,240 --> 02:50:46,860
This feels very Pyramid Head-coded.

2546
02:50:48,620 --> 02:50:52,080
Wash yourself, make yourself clean, remove the evil of your deeds from my sight.

2547
02:50:58,630 --> 02:50:59,730
Oh no.

2548
02:51:00,770 --> 02:51:02,450
Looks like Pyramid Head colors.

2549
02:51:04,090 --> 02:51:05,990
Feels very Pyramid Head-coded.

2550
02:51:17,620 --> 02:51:20,660
Oh my god, alright, here we go.

2551
02:51:22,140 --> 02:51:22,920
Here we go.

2552
02:51:24,900 --> 02:51:27,380
Got my shotgun out just in case.

2553
02:51:39,320 --> 02:51:40,120
Hello?

2554
02:51:41,760 --> 02:51:43,200
Mr. Head?

2555
02:51:47,260 --> 02:51:48,680
Mr. Head, is that you?

2556
02:51:56,740 --> 02:51:58,560
Oh my god, it's so quiet.

2557
02:51:58,880 --> 02:52:00,060
It's just so quiet.

2558
02:52:04,080 --> 02:52:05,100
Mr. Head!

2559
02:52:06,040 --> 02:52:11,480
We're not close enough to be Pyram- Mr. Pyram- Mr. Pyram- I can't call him by his first name.

2560
02:52:17,420 --> 02:52:18,800
Mr. Head is his father.

2561
02:52:19,000 --> 02:52:20,100
Please call me Pyramid.

2562
02:52:30,960 --> 02:52:32,340
We're not close enough.

2563
02:52:32,420 --> 02:52:35,680
We're not tight enough to be- for me to call him by his first name.

2564
02:52:39,720 --> 02:52:41,960
We ain't close like that, guys.

2565
02:52:54,270 --> 02:52:55,510
I hate this.

2566
02:52:58,310 --> 02:53:00,690
I hate this so much.

2567
02:53:11,790 --> 02:53:14,630
It's just so, like, quiet.

2568
02:53:19,480 --> 02:53:21,720
It's like way too quiet.

2569
02:53:21,920 --> 02:53:22,780
I hate it.

2570
02:53:22,780 --> 02:53:25,700
Oh my god, is this it?

2571
02:53:26,280 --> 02:53:28,100
Is this where I fight Mr. Head?

2572
02:53:38,030 --> 02:53:39,690
Pyramid Conehead?

2573
02:53:52,410 --> 02:53:53,270
Hello?

2574
02:53:55,490 --> 02:53:56,350
Hello?

2575
02:54:17,720 --> 02:54:18,180
Hello?

2576
02:54:22,380 --> 02:54:24,620
No, not the water.

2577
02:54:29,000 --> 02:54:29,560
Oh...

2578
02:54:37,280 --> 02:54:37,840
Okay.

2579
02:54:42,190 --> 02:54:43,490
I hate this.

2580
02:54:44,230 --> 02:54:46,090
I hate this so much.

2581
02:54:51,750 --> 02:54:55,930
The things I do for my dead wife who I killed.

2582
02:54:58,150 --> 02:55:00,450
Well, now that I know I killed her, I can just leave, right?

2583
02:55:00,630 --> 02:55:03,070
Like, I know she's definitely dead-dead.

2584
02:55:03,450 --> 02:55:06,050
So, like, I should just leave!

2585
02:55:08,650 --> 02:55:10,610
You know she's not alive!

2586
02:55:17,120 --> 02:55:18,880
Yeah, we might as well go now.

2587
02:55:29,290 --> 02:55:30,450
Oh, okay.

2588
02:55:32,950 --> 02:55:34,130
Down we go.

2589
02:55:40,800 --> 02:55:42,620
And you just drive off.

2590
02:55:47,140 --> 02:55:48,540
Is this where I fight him?

2591
02:55:49,540 --> 02:55:51,760
Is this where I fight my inner- my inner demons?

2592
02:55:56,430 --> 02:55:57,670
Oh, Angela?

2593
02:56:07,620 --> 02:56:08,520
Mama?

2594
02:56:09,520 --> 02:56:11,720
I was looking for you.

2595
02:56:12,680 --> 02:56:14,760
You're the only one left.

2596
02:56:15,380 --> 02:56:17,680
Maybe then I can finally rest.

2597
02:56:17,920 --> 02:56:18,540
Mama?

2598
02:56:22,140 --> 02:56:23,180
What's wrong?

2599
02:56:24,160 --> 02:56:25,020
It's mommy.

2600
02:56:26,460 --> 02:56:26,800
Wait.

2601
02:56:30,500 --> 02:56:32,100
You're not my mama.

2602
02:56:36,450 --> 02:56:38,630
It's- it's you.

2603
02:56:38,790 --> 02:56:39,330
I can be.

2604
02:56:39,330 --> 02:56:39,430
I can be.

2605
02:56:44,930 --> 02:56:46,330
I can be your mama.

2606
02:56:46,490 --> 02:56:47,270
You want that.

2607
02:56:51,810 --> 02:56:52,370
What?

2608
02:57:17,400 --> 02:57:18,960
I killed him for you.

2609
02:57:21,380 --> 02:57:23,460
I deserve what happened.

2610
02:57:23,680 --> 02:57:24,860
Oh my god.

2611
02:57:25,020 --> 02:57:27,240
That is not true.

2612
02:57:28,860 --> 02:57:29,920
That's fucked.

2613
02:57:30,480 --> 02:57:31,340
Don't pity me.

2614
02:57:33,160 --> 02:57:35,040
I'm not worth it.

2615
02:57:41,260 --> 02:57:44,040
Or maybe you think you can save me?

2616
02:57:45,160 --> 02:57:45,840
Of course.

2617
02:57:46,580 --> 02:57:47,460
I'm the protagonist.

2618
02:57:50,380 --> 02:57:52,220
Everything is fixable, Angela.

2619
02:57:52,620 --> 02:57:53,080
Would you love me?

2620
02:57:54,540 --> 02:57:55,080
Whoa!

2621
02:57:57,440 --> 02:57:58,120
Care for me?

2622
02:57:58,740 --> 02:57:59,160
Whoa!

2623
02:58:00,700 --> 02:58:02,720
Heal all my pain?

2624
02:58:04,840 --> 02:58:06,960
I don't think I can fix her at this point.

2625
02:58:08,040 --> 02:58:08,640
Oh my god, no.

2626
02:58:08,840 --> 02:58:10,140
She's like, can you fix me?

2627
02:58:10,320 --> 02:58:11,420
No, no, no.

2628
02:58:11,840 --> 02:58:13,020
Don't say that.

2629
02:58:13,260 --> 02:58:13,660
No.

2630
02:58:14,860 --> 02:58:17,280
I'm gonna be so tempted to fix you.

2631
02:58:22,560 --> 02:58:24,060
Give me back the knife.

2632
02:58:27,920 --> 02:58:29,380
No, I won't.

2633
02:58:31,340 --> 02:58:32,740
Saving it for yourself.

2634
02:58:32,740 --> 02:58:33,560
No, my weakness.

2635
02:58:33,880 --> 02:58:34,720
I'm fixing her.

2636
02:58:39,070 --> 02:58:40,370
Have it your way.

2637
02:58:41,790 --> 02:58:43,590
It doesn't change anything.

2638
02:58:47,200 --> 02:58:49,460
Angela, we can get therapy together.

2639
02:58:50,360 --> 02:58:52,140
We've both murdered people.

2640
02:58:52,760 --> 02:58:57,400
Yours is self-defense and mine is technically self-defense from monetary debt.

2641
02:59:00,180 --> 02:59:01,540
It's hot as hell in here.

2642
02:59:08,900 --> 02:59:10,120
You see it too?

2643
02:59:16,500 --> 02:59:18,560
For me, it's always like this.

2644
02:59:18,640 --> 02:59:20,880
Oh, everything blurring.

2645
02:59:26,890 --> 02:59:28,310
Oh, so it's not real.

2646
02:59:28,770 --> 02:59:29,630
James, touch the fire.

2647
02:59:29,710 --> 02:59:30,370
It's not real.

2648
02:59:33,840 --> 02:59:35,380
I just leave her?

2649
02:59:35,620 --> 02:59:37,460
James, what the fuck?

2650
02:59:38,300 --> 02:59:40,600
Don't you wanna fix her, James?

2651
02:59:42,220 --> 02:59:43,900
I just leave her?

2652
02:59:45,400 --> 02:59:47,380
Okay, James is not a good guy.

2653
02:59:47,380 --> 02:59:52,100
I mean, he did kill his wife, but like...

2654
02:59:52,100 --> 02:59:55,600
Now I definitely know he's not a good guy.

2655
02:59:57,940 --> 03:00:00,400
He's like, I cannot fix that.

2656
03:00:17,590 --> 03:00:18,310
Oh!

2657
03:00:30,010 --> 03:00:30,730
Whoops.

2658
03:00:34,400 --> 03:00:37,340
I'm not supposed to kill them now?

2659
03:00:40,160 --> 03:00:41,740
Like, I got fucked up.

2660
03:01:00,180 --> 03:01:01,500
Like, oh my god.

2661
03:01:01,540 --> 03:01:02,620
No, now I'm fucking...

2662
03:01:02,620 --> 03:01:04,120
Oh my god, now I feel bad.

2663
03:01:05,020 --> 03:01:06,220
Why are you scared of me?

2664
03:01:11,420 --> 03:01:12,720
Why are you so tired?

2665
03:01:18,880 --> 03:01:20,380
I've been through so much.

2666
03:01:20,420 --> 03:01:22,660
Oh, and now I'm the bad guy.

2667
03:01:24,400 --> 03:01:26,220
Now I'm the bad guy.

2668
03:01:26,220 --> 03:01:28,320
I've been through so much.

2669
03:01:28,360 --> 03:01:35,420
But now I'm the bad guy for fucking killing them when they slapped me first.

2670
03:01:41,400 --> 03:01:43,720
Oh my god, that's a lot of saves.

2671
03:01:43,940 --> 03:01:45,480
Which one's the right one?

2672
03:01:53,800 --> 03:01:55,920
Oh, that looks like a pyramid head level.

2673
03:01:57,440 --> 03:01:59,200
Guys, can I kill him?

2674
03:01:59,420 --> 03:02:00,880
Before I...

2675
03:02:00,880 --> 03:02:08,740
Before I fucking go in and shoot pyramid head, can I kill him?

2676
03:02:17,210 --> 03:02:17,830
Alright.

2677
03:02:17,830 --> 03:02:18,270
Alright.

2678
03:02:20,350 --> 03:02:21,710
You can try?

2679
03:02:29,160 --> 03:02:30,020
Oh my god.

2680
03:02:30,340 --> 03:02:32,020
I'm gonna go back and shoot that spider lady.

2681
03:02:32,160 --> 03:02:32,420
I'm gonna...

2682
03:02:43,180 --> 03:02:44,540
I'm gonna go back.

2683
03:02:44,600 --> 03:02:46,060
You guys gonna be smart asses.

2684
03:02:46,260 --> 03:02:48,420
I will go back and shoot one of them.

2685
03:02:55,740 --> 03:02:57,540
Don't give me a direct answer.

2686
03:02:57,640 --> 03:02:58,620
I will go back.

2687
03:03:23,610 --> 03:03:24,170
Maria?

2688
03:03:37,400 --> 03:03:38,960
There's two of them?

2689
03:03:39,780 --> 03:03:40,700
They're my clones.

2690
03:03:41,220 --> 03:03:42,600
This is how I'm gonna fake my death.

2691
03:03:43,040 --> 03:03:44,780
Just like how I faked Mary's death.

2692
03:04:09,610 --> 03:04:10,570
She's smiling.

2693
03:04:23,700 --> 03:04:24,560
She's fine.

2694
03:04:24,800 --> 03:04:25,540
She's smiling.

2695
03:04:34,310 --> 03:04:35,770
Did she come back alive?

2696
03:04:40,030 --> 03:04:41,430
It's like her fourth death.

2697
03:04:41,550 --> 03:04:43,130
I like fucking got used to it.

2698
03:04:52,660 --> 03:04:54,860
I'm gonna let the dog out in me.

2699
03:04:55,840 --> 03:04:56,840
I'm ready.

2700
03:05:00,260 --> 03:05:01,860
Okay, this is...

2701
03:05:01,860 --> 03:05:03,300
Why is there two of them?

2702
03:05:07,440 --> 03:05:08,920
Oh, shit!

2703
03:05:14,340 --> 03:05:15,740
Okay, I gotta reload.

2704
03:05:21,610 --> 03:05:23,390
I'm shooting a leg!

2705
03:05:27,360 --> 03:05:28,640
Oh, fuck!

2706
03:05:29,000 --> 03:05:30,240
Oh, this is not fair.

2707
03:05:34,600 --> 03:05:35,780
There's two!

2708
03:05:36,140 --> 03:05:37,600
They can throw it down!

2709
03:05:51,340 --> 03:05:52,260
Oh, God.

2710
03:05:55,530 --> 03:05:56,870
Oh, my God, please.

2711
03:05:57,330 --> 03:05:58,410
I'm reloading.

2712
03:06:00,830 --> 03:06:01,430
Oh!

2713
03:06:01,590 --> 03:06:02,850
Okay, that was my bad.

2714
03:06:03,190 --> 03:06:04,470
That was my bad.

2715
03:06:04,550 --> 03:06:05,970
That was my bad too!

2716
03:06:17,990 --> 03:06:19,650
I'm shooting his legs!

2717
03:06:19,750 --> 03:06:20,230
What do you want?

2718
03:06:23,730 --> 03:06:25,450
Oh, my God!

2719
03:06:51,600 --> 03:06:54,000
How tanky are they?

2720
03:06:59,260 --> 03:07:00,660
Holy shit!

2721
03:07:00,780 --> 03:07:02,000
They're so tanky!

2722
03:07:08,020 --> 03:07:08,860
Guys!

2723
03:07:09,800 --> 03:07:13,880
It's so hard to shoot when you have a dog head on you!

2724
03:07:15,900 --> 03:07:16,320
Wait.

2725
03:07:17,580 --> 03:07:18,560
Wait, he stopped.

2726
03:07:31,120 --> 03:07:31,920
What?

2727
03:07:33,160 --> 03:07:34,320
What is he doing?

2728
03:07:38,480 --> 03:07:39,280
What?

2729
03:07:50,290 --> 03:07:51,770
What the fuck?

2730
03:07:53,170 --> 03:07:54,030
What happened?

2731
03:07:58,020 --> 03:07:58,940
Oh, my God.

2732
03:07:59,000 --> 03:07:59,640
I have...

2733
03:07:59,640 --> 03:08:00,660
I'm so little.

2734
03:08:01,320 --> 03:08:02,140
Oh, my God.

2735
03:08:04,660 --> 03:08:05,580
Got an egg.

2736
03:08:08,360 --> 03:08:09,580
And another egg.

2737
03:08:10,740 --> 03:08:12,040
Got two eggs.

2738
03:08:13,180 --> 03:08:14,660
Why did they do that?

2739
03:08:20,270 --> 03:08:22,190
Why the fuck did they do that?

2740
03:08:30,250 --> 03:08:31,210
Smack that.

2741
03:08:32,190 --> 03:08:33,430
La, la, la, la, la.

2742
03:08:33,430 --> 03:08:34,170
Smack that.

2743
03:08:34,630 --> 03:08:35,750
La, la, la, la, la.

2744
03:08:38,090 --> 03:08:38,690
Okay.

2745
03:08:39,930 --> 03:08:41,750
I guess I'll put the eggs in here.

2746
03:08:41,750 --> 03:08:47,560
I think they're dead dead.

2747
03:08:48,720 --> 03:08:49,700
Extra ammo.

2748
03:08:59,320 --> 03:09:00,340
Alright.

2749
03:09:00,560 --> 03:09:02,280
That was the pyramid head fight.

2750
03:09:08,300 --> 03:09:09,320
Mary?

2751
03:09:12,080 --> 03:09:12,960
Flowers?

2752
03:09:22,220 --> 03:09:23,280
What, Mary?

2753
03:09:23,440 --> 03:09:25,040
You better travel all the way here.

2754
03:09:37,180 --> 03:09:39,380
Oh, you're still hot.

2755
03:09:40,200 --> 03:09:42,440
You're still so hot.

2756
03:09:50,460 --> 03:09:51,220
I guess I'll go to them anyway.

2757
03:09:54,960 --> 03:09:57,140
It'd be easier if they just killed me.

2758
03:09:59,160 --> 03:10:02,220
But I guess the hospital's making a nice profit off of me.

2759
03:10:05,120 --> 03:10:06,820
Why are you still here?

2760
03:10:06,880 --> 03:10:07,960
I told you to go.

2761
03:10:09,920 --> 03:10:11,160
Are you dead?

2762
03:10:17,160 --> 03:10:17,720
Jesus.

2763
03:10:20,140 --> 03:10:20,780
Wait.

2764
03:10:22,700 --> 03:10:23,340
Please.

2765
03:10:30,900 --> 03:10:32,260
Don't leave me alone.

2766
03:10:34,900 --> 03:10:36,820
I didn't mean what I said.

2767
03:10:39,340 --> 03:10:39,880
Please.

2768
03:10:41,960 --> 03:10:43,720
Tell me you'll be okay.

2769
03:10:43,720 --> 03:10:44,000
It'll be okay, Mary.

2770
03:10:44,100 --> 03:10:45,860
Don't mind the pillow I'm holding.

2771
03:10:47,220 --> 03:10:48,400
Oh my god.

2772
03:10:48,460 --> 03:10:49,800
Tell me I'm not going there.

2773
03:10:50,260 --> 03:10:50,720
Bro.

2774
03:10:51,000 --> 03:10:51,540
James.

2775
03:10:51,740 --> 03:10:53,100
What the fuck?

2776
03:10:54,200 --> 03:10:55,000
Help me.

2777
03:10:56,460 --> 03:10:57,700
Okay, I did not mean that.

2778
03:10:57,700 --> 03:10:59,280
I did not realize she was going to say that next.

2779
03:10:59,420 --> 03:11:00,560
I didn't realize.

2780
03:11:01,080 --> 03:11:02,960
I didn't realize she was going to say that next.

2781
03:11:11,720 --> 03:11:14,180
Okay, now I can run, right?

2782
03:11:22,880 --> 03:11:23,880
Can I run now?

2783
03:11:39,340 --> 03:11:40,560
I knew it.

2784
03:11:40,720 --> 03:11:42,820
It was all because it was too expensive.

2785
03:11:47,910 --> 03:11:48,990
I knew it.

2786
03:11:50,970 --> 03:11:53,530
It was all about the medical bills.

2787
03:11:56,660 --> 03:11:58,380
Alright, in we go.

2788
03:12:00,760 --> 03:12:02,560
Oh my god, there's a lot of ammo.

2789
03:12:06,220 --> 03:12:09,660
You know things are gonna go crazy.

2790
03:12:12,080 --> 03:12:13,960
That is a lot of ammo.

2791
03:12:18,600 --> 03:12:19,920
Which way do I go?

2792
03:12:20,120 --> 03:12:21,460
This one goes downstairs.

2793
03:12:28,590 --> 03:12:30,410
Shape forces the mind.

2794
03:12:33,970 --> 03:12:35,870
Oh my god, there's so much ammo.

2795
03:12:37,870 --> 03:12:38,650
It's okay.

2796
03:12:38,870 --> 03:12:42,130
There's a reason why I have a lot of...

2797
03:12:42,130 --> 03:12:44,190
I kept a lot of rifle ammo.

2798
03:12:48,020 --> 03:12:49,600
There is a reason.

2799
03:12:54,610 --> 03:12:55,630
Right here.

2800
03:12:55,750 --> 03:12:56,870
It's time to go.

2801
03:13:00,270 --> 03:13:01,710
Here we go.

2802
03:13:02,330 --> 03:13:03,430
Up we go.

2803
03:13:05,430 --> 03:13:07,150
Oh, rifle is not good?

2804
03:13:07,230 --> 03:13:10,150
Well, let me see how much ammo I have on my fucking shotgun.

2805
03:13:12,890 --> 03:13:14,930
Guys, I think I messed up a little bit.

2806
03:13:15,850 --> 03:13:17,810
I do not have a lot.

2807
03:13:19,670 --> 03:13:22,190
I have like...

2808
03:13:23,290 --> 03:13:23,790
Like...

2809
03:13:23,790 --> 03:13:24,650
15 bullets.

2810
03:13:30,040 --> 03:13:30,700
Oh, hey.

2811
03:13:31,240 --> 03:13:31,800
A bed.

2812
03:13:32,320 --> 03:13:34,480
Mary, why did you put a single bed?

2813
03:13:46,700 --> 03:13:47,220
Mary.

2814
03:13:48,940 --> 03:13:51,100
Mary, I'm here for the ghost booty call.

2815
03:13:51,760 --> 03:13:53,340
Why do you have a single bed?

2816
03:14:09,500 --> 03:14:10,680
What do you mean?

2817
03:14:10,740 --> 03:14:11,780
She looks just like her.

2818
03:14:23,120 --> 03:14:24,680
James, she's right here.

2819
03:14:30,360 --> 03:14:31,900
Oh, she's hot again.

2820
03:14:32,100 --> 03:14:33,300
She doesn't look like she's sick.

2821
03:14:54,760 --> 03:14:55,760
I'm yours.

2822
03:14:58,340 --> 03:14:59,860
I'm here for you.

2823
03:14:59,960 --> 03:15:01,280
So what if I'm not her?

2824
03:15:02,160 --> 03:15:03,160
You're not her?

2825
03:15:04,540 --> 03:15:07,080
I can give you what she never could.

2826
03:15:07,780 --> 03:15:08,800
Oh my god, really?

2827
03:15:10,900 --> 03:15:12,920
Wait, you can do...

2828
03:15:15,940 --> 03:15:17,280
Wait, is this Maria?

2829
03:15:18,860 --> 03:15:20,320
Oh my god, it's Maria!

2830
03:15:22,720 --> 03:15:23,320
Hi.

2831
03:15:25,500 --> 03:15:27,300
Oh my god, it's Maria!

2832
03:15:30,880 --> 03:15:32,880
You can do that thing that she wouldn't do.

2833
03:15:38,180 --> 03:15:40,780
I saw M, so I assume that says Mary.

2834
03:15:41,080 --> 03:15:42,320
But it was actually Maria.

2835
03:15:52,390 --> 03:15:52,930
No?

2836
03:16:07,300 --> 03:16:08,080
Huh?

2837
03:16:08,500 --> 03:16:09,980
You're part of my head!

2838
03:16:18,160 --> 03:16:20,810
What the fuck is that?

2839
03:16:23,490 --> 03:16:24,650
Oh shit!

2840
03:16:26,170 --> 03:16:28,430
Oh shit, she goes crazy now.

2841
03:16:29,110 --> 03:16:30,850
Can I shoot that?

2842
03:16:34,240 --> 03:16:34,950
Where is she?

2843
03:16:42,060 --> 03:16:42,910
Super freak.

2844
03:16:43,590 --> 03:16:44,470
Super freak.

2845
03:16:48,090 --> 03:16:49,690
Oh shit, these hurt.

2846
03:16:56,820 --> 03:16:57,500
God!

2847
03:16:58,280 --> 03:17:00,000
How do I fight this?

2848
03:17:02,020 --> 03:17:03,200
Oh, Jesus!

2849
03:17:04,880 --> 03:17:07,280
I'm trying to figure out how to dodge this.

2850
03:17:12,720 --> 03:17:14,140
Don't fucking finish the rifle.

2851
03:17:14,960 --> 03:17:16,780
It's easier, honestly.

2852
03:17:25,220 --> 03:17:28,080
Oh shit, oh, she's going full...

2853
03:17:28,080 --> 03:17:29,720
Oh no, she's getting on the ground!

2854
03:17:34,000 --> 03:17:35,660
No, not the dark!

2855
03:17:36,520 --> 03:17:38,100
I don't think I can see!

2856
03:17:41,500 --> 03:17:43,320
Oh no, not the dark.

2857
03:17:43,900 --> 03:17:44,440
My weakness.

2858
03:17:49,800 --> 03:17:50,660
She knows.

2859
03:17:51,340 --> 03:17:53,380
She knows I can't see now.

2860
03:18:03,230 --> 03:18:04,110
God, please.

2861
03:18:06,630 --> 03:18:07,630
I can't see shit.

2862
03:18:12,320 --> 03:18:13,500
Do these go away?

2863
03:18:13,660 --> 03:18:14,540
Or do I have to shoot it?

2864
03:18:21,520 --> 03:18:22,600
Why is she landing?

2865
03:18:26,750 --> 03:18:28,070
Oh, you're coming down!

2866
03:18:28,210 --> 03:18:28,990
Oh, there you are!

2867
03:18:29,550 --> 03:18:29,970
Hey, Maria!

2868
03:18:31,710 --> 03:18:32,670
Goodbye, Maria!

2869
03:18:48,800 --> 03:18:49,840
I'm gonna shoot these.

2870
03:18:49,980 --> 03:18:50,640
They're so annoying.

2871
03:18:53,240 --> 03:18:54,080
Hey, Maria!

2872
03:19:07,990 --> 03:19:09,010
Oh, I'm back here?

2873
03:19:09,410 --> 03:19:10,610
Okay, I'm gonna use my rifle.

2874
03:19:14,940 --> 03:19:15,980
Oh shit!

2875
03:19:16,880 --> 03:19:17,560
Sorry!

2876
03:19:18,250 --> 03:19:19,600
Oh, fuck!

2877
03:19:21,750 --> 03:19:22,420
Jesus...

2878
03:19:23,760 --> 03:19:24,430
What?!

2879
03:19:25,370 --> 03:19:28,060
Bro, her range is actually crazy.

2880
03:19:31,410 --> 03:19:33,580
Like, what is this range?

2881
03:19:39,840 --> 03:19:41,100
Where'd she go?

2882
03:19:49,940 --> 03:19:50,980
Oh god.

2883
03:19:53,510 --> 03:19:54,180
Okay.

2884
03:19:54,980 --> 03:19:55,500
Dodge.

2885
03:19:59,770 --> 03:20:01,120
Alright, rifle only.

2886
03:20:05,760 --> 03:20:07,060
Oh, goodbye, I guess.

2887
03:20:20,500 --> 03:20:21,680
Time to reload.

2888
03:20:22,580 --> 03:20:25,520
Hey, reload!

2889
03:20:26,340 --> 03:20:27,400
Don't be rude!

2890
03:20:36,300 --> 03:20:37,220
Jesus Christ.

2891
03:20:37,620 --> 03:20:38,280
Jesus Christ.

2892
03:20:56,390 --> 03:20:58,850
I don't think it helped that, you know.

2893
03:21:01,610 --> 03:21:03,650
It definitely does not help that.

2894
03:21:03,650 --> 03:21:05,130
I ran out of shotgun ammo!

2895
03:21:17,130 --> 03:21:18,990
Oh my god, there we go.

2896
03:21:19,790 --> 03:21:20,870
That should be it.

2897
03:21:20,970 --> 03:21:22,090
There's no way.

2898
03:21:24,090 --> 03:21:24,990
That should be it.

2899
03:21:26,790 --> 03:21:29,350
You cannot be alive after that.

2900
03:21:35,480 --> 03:21:36,120
Hello?

2901
03:21:44,820 --> 03:21:45,460
Maria?

2902
03:21:49,630 --> 03:21:50,450
What do I do?

2903
03:22:19,960 --> 03:22:21,380
Hey, handsome.

2904
03:22:32,720 --> 03:22:33,540
I'm sorry.

2905
03:22:34,980 --> 03:22:36,080
Don't be.

2906
03:22:37,120 --> 03:22:38,240
I told you.

2907
03:22:39,240 --> 03:22:40,980
I wanted the pain to end.

2908
03:22:43,240 --> 03:22:43,940
Yeah.

2909
03:22:52,990 --> 03:22:54,970
But that's not why I did it.

2910
03:22:59,840 --> 03:23:01,360
The truth is...

2911
03:23:03,980 --> 03:23:05,440
I hated you.

2912
03:23:08,380 --> 03:23:10,660
I wanted you out of the way.

2913
03:23:13,320 --> 03:23:15,180
I wanted my life back.

2914
03:23:19,570 --> 03:23:21,530
You're so, so beautiful.

2915
03:23:22,690 --> 03:23:23,510
Mary.

2916
03:23:23,970 --> 03:23:25,510
Why do you look so sad?

2917
03:23:37,660 --> 03:23:38,180
Mary.

2918
03:23:38,740 --> 03:23:40,320
It's okay, James.

2919
03:23:44,560 --> 03:23:45,140
Here.

2920
03:23:46,540 --> 03:23:48,660
What is

2921
03:23:56,170 --> 03:23:56,430
this?

2922
03:23:57,990 --> 03:23:59,950
It's what you've been looking for.

2923
03:24:03,980 --> 03:24:05,020
It's a letter!

2924
03:24:11,290 --> 03:24:12,130
Oh my god, Mary.

2925
03:24:14,130 --> 03:24:16,070
She wanted me to kill her.

2926
03:24:16,410 --> 03:24:18,210
So we can cash out on a life insurance.

2927
03:24:18,770 --> 03:24:21,390
Oh my god, she was the love of my life.

2928
03:24:22,430 --> 03:24:25,730
I knew this ghost booty call was worth it in the end.

2929
03:24:38,280 --> 03:24:39,760
That's true love right there.

2930
03:24:42,020 --> 03:24:44,380
The letter's the insurance policy I got.

2931
03:24:52,380 --> 03:24:54,380
Wait, did I actually get the good ending?

2932
03:25:02,790 --> 03:25:05,830
Best ending, that's a key right?

2933
03:25:06,370 --> 03:25:09,710
I knew shooting that guy was not an issue.

2934
03:25:10,090 --> 03:25:13,130
I should've came back and shot the spider too.

2935
03:25:16,510 --> 03:25:20,270
In my restless dreams, I see that town.

2936
03:25:21,670 --> 03:25:22,710
Silent Hill.

2937
03:25:22,710 --> 03:25:27,330
You promised you'd take me there again someday.

2938
03:25:28,590 --> 03:25:30,030
But you never did.

2939
03:25:31,770 --> 03:25:34,430
Well, I'm alone there now.

2940
03:25:35,170 --> 03:25:36,990
In our special place.

2941
03:25:38,230 --> 03:25:41,770
Waiting for you to come and see me.

2942
03:25:44,190 --> 03:25:45,650
But you never do.

2943
03:25:48,850 --> 03:25:51,030
So, I wait.

2944
03:25:52,550 --> 03:25:56,610
Wrapped in my cocoon of pain and loneliness.

2945
03:25:58,830 --> 03:26:02,110
I know, I've done a terrible thing to you.

2946
03:26:03,470 --> 03:26:06,350
I wish I could change that, but I can't.

2947
03:26:08,670 --> 03:26:13,170
I feel so pathetic and ugly laying here.

2948
03:26:18,540 --> 03:26:22,420
Sorry, Gumi sent me pictures of the awards show.

2949
03:26:24,120 --> 03:26:27,280
And that is how unfair it is.

2950
03:26:31,610 --> 03:26:33,450
The doctor came today.

2951
03:26:34,970 --> 03:26:37,890
Told me I could go home for a short stay.

2952
03:26:39,190 --> 03:26:40,850
It's not that I'm getting better.

2953
03:26:41,290 --> 03:26:44,870
It's just that this could be my last chance.

2954
03:26:46,650 --> 03:26:50,410
Even so, I'm glad to be coming home.

2955
03:26:51,810 --> 03:26:53,590
I missed you so much.

2956
03:26:53,590 --> 03:26:58,550
But I'm afraid, James.

2957
03:27:00,430 --> 03:27:03,630
I'm afraid you don't really want me to come home.

2958
03:27:05,350 --> 03:27:09,350
Every time you come to see me, I can tell how hard it is on you.

2959
03:27:10,430 --> 03:27:12,490
I don't know if you hate me.

2960
03:27:12,690 --> 03:27:13,290
I did.

2961
03:27:13,750 --> 03:27:15,350
I really hated you.

2962
03:27:15,890 --> 03:27:18,170
Maybe I just disgust you.

2963
03:27:20,190 --> 03:27:21,450
I'm so sorry.

2964
03:27:25,540 --> 03:27:28,760
When I first learned I was gonna die, I couldn't accept it.

2965
03:27:29,440 --> 03:27:31,520
I was so angry.

2966
03:27:32,060 --> 03:27:34,580
I struck out at everyone I loved.

2967
03:27:36,280 --> 03:27:37,400
Especially you.

2968
03:27:39,380 --> 03:27:41,680
And that's why I understand if you hate me.

2969
03:27:42,900 --> 03:27:44,540
But I want you to know...

2970
03:27:45,760 --> 03:27:48,100
I will always love you.

2971
03:27:50,380 --> 03:27:53,540
Even though our life together had to end like this...

2972
03:27:53,540 --> 03:27:56,740
I still wouldn't trade it for the world.

2973
03:28:02,220 --> 03:28:04,900
Well, this letter has gone on too long.

2974
03:28:05,400 --> 03:28:06,900
So, I'll say goodbye.

2975
03:28:08,640 --> 03:28:11,360
I told the nurse to give this to you after I'm gone.

2976
03:28:12,680 --> 03:28:16,520
Which means that as you're reading this, I'm already dead.

2977
03:28:16,800 --> 03:28:18,880
But that's okay.

2978
03:28:20,320 --> 03:28:22,000
I'm not afraid of it anymore.

2979
03:28:23,240 --> 03:28:25,700
I just hope the pain will end soon.

2980
03:28:26,620 --> 03:28:29,260
So that you remember me for who I was.

2981
03:28:30,400 --> 03:28:32,080
And not what the disease made me.

2982
03:28:34,300 --> 03:28:36,600
I want you to go on.

2983
03:28:37,720 --> 03:28:39,640
I want you to live.

2984
03:28:41,060 --> 03:28:41,860
For yourself.

2985
03:28:42,900 --> 03:28:43,860
And for others.

2986
03:28:45,300 --> 03:28:46,760
Like you did for me.

2987
03:28:48,720 --> 03:28:52,420
So like, he refused to read the letter until now?

2988
03:28:52,760 --> 03:28:53,820
You made me happy.

2989
03:28:56,520 --> 03:28:59,020
Because like, she died 3 years ago.

2990
03:29:00,020 --> 03:29:02,440
So she had the letter...

2991
03:29:03,220 --> 03:29:05,160
So he had the letter for 3 years.

2992
03:29:07,220 --> 03:29:08,440
Yeah, he couldn't...

2993
03:29:09,180 --> 03:29:11,380
Yeah, he couldn't read it.

2994
03:29:13,140 --> 03:29:15,320
Oh, she died 3 days ago!

2995
03:29:20,350 --> 03:29:24,190
It wasn't really 3... Oh, she was diagnosed 3 years ago!

2996
03:29:25,150 --> 03:29:29,730
The 3 years was in my head, just like how I felt like I was playing Silent Hill for 20 years.

2997
03:29:31,130 --> 03:29:33,990
Yeah, because like, Laura just turned 8.

2998
03:29:35,410 --> 03:29:36,550
No, no, no, no.

2999
03:29:36,610 --> 03:29:38,570
She died by natural causes, guys.

3000
03:29:39,030 --> 03:29:40,970
That's what we're telling the insurance company.

3001
03:29:42,430 --> 03:29:42,870
Guys.

3002
03:29:43,310 --> 03:29:44,970
She died by natural causes.

3003
03:30:01,880 --> 03:30:04,180
So he didn't want to read the...

3004
03:30:04,760 --> 03:30:11,120
He didn't want to read the letter until like now, because he was still accepting the fate that like, you know...

3005
03:30:11,120 --> 03:30:13,720
She naturally died with a pillow on top of her head.

3006
03:30:16,520 --> 03:30:18,740
Oh my god, we finally did it.

3007
03:30:18,880 --> 03:30:21,900
We fucking finally did Silent Hill.

3008
03:30:24,810 --> 03:30:26,770
I'm actually so surprised!

3009
03:30:27,210 --> 03:30:28,970
We like, did it so fast.

3010
03:30:28,970 --> 03:30:33,330
I think like, I was so fucking determined that I just ran straight into everything.

3011
03:30:33,590 --> 03:30:37,970
I was like, I can't, I can't, I can't make this a 6 hour thing.

3012
03:30:38,210 --> 03:30:40,080
I just like, ran straight and just go...

3013
03:30:42,670 --> 03:30:46,070
Thank you for the 10 gifted ships, thank you, thank you.

3014
03:30:47,310 --> 03:30:48,070
We did it.

3015
03:30:48,750 --> 03:30:51,690
Oh my god, I'm so happy.

3016
03:30:52,370 --> 03:30:53,890
Oh my god.

3017
03:30:54,690 --> 03:30:56,570
We finally did it.

3018
03:30:56,570 --> 03:31:02,190
Two months after Halloween, we fucking finished Silent Hill 2.

3019
03:31:02,610 --> 03:31:04,210
What a journey.

3020
03:31:05,070 --> 03:31:07,430
Oh my god, I knew I was gonna get the good end.

3021
03:31:07,510 --> 03:31:09,530
You guys were like, no, don't shoot it.

3022
03:31:10,050 --> 03:31:11,310
Jesus, it's over.

3023
03:31:11,550 --> 03:31:13,150
Bad ending, bad ending.

3024
03:31:13,510 --> 03:31:15,370
Look at that chat.

3025
03:31:15,790 --> 03:31:16,790
Doesn't matter.

3026
03:31:17,130 --> 03:31:19,770
I knew I should have gone back and shot the legs.

3027
03:31:19,950 --> 03:31:20,990
I knew it.

3028
03:31:20,990 --> 03:31:21,670
I...

3029
03:31:23,250 --> 03:31:25,290
You deserve the bad ending.

3030
03:31:25,490 --> 03:31:26,210
No joking.

3031
03:31:26,930 --> 03:31:29,150
Oh, but the game didn't give it to me.

3032
03:31:29,270 --> 03:31:30,890
The game didn't think so.

3033
03:31:31,490 --> 03:31:32,510
Mike, thank you for the super chat.

3034
03:31:32,610 --> 03:31:33,210
Thank you, thank you.

3035
03:31:33,270 --> 03:31:35,490
You're finally free of the Silent Hill.

3036
03:31:35,790 --> 03:31:37,030
Paladin, thank you for the super chat.

3037
03:31:37,110 --> 03:31:38,070
Thank you, thank you.

3038
03:31:38,710 --> 03:31:45,370
If you got the other ending, you find out that Mary's corpse is in the back of the car you drove to get.

3039
03:31:45,650 --> 03:31:47,090
Is that the bad ending?

3040
03:31:48,190 --> 03:31:52,870
The bad ending is that there's a body in my car and I'm gonna let a child...

3041
03:31:52,870 --> 03:31:55,670
I'm gonna let a child sit in the car?

3042
03:31:59,070 --> 03:31:59,510
What?

3043
03:32:02,790 --> 03:32:04,450
Oh, it's the true ending.

3044
03:32:05,730 --> 03:32:07,650
Wait, how do you get the true ending?

3045
03:32:08,870 --> 03:32:10,590
Am I taking Laura to see it?

3046
03:32:13,950 --> 03:32:14,390
Wait.

3047
03:32:15,070 --> 03:32:16,890
How do you get the true ending?

3048
03:32:20,330 --> 03:32:23,030
You just drive into the lake?

3049
03:32:24,610 --> 03:32:26,270
Wait, MrFish, thank you for the super chat.

3050
03:32:26,370 --> 03:32:26,850
Thank you, thank you.

3051
03:32:26,850 --> 03:32:28,990
Now it's time for NG+.

3052
03:32:28,990 --> 03:32:29,890
Thank you for the super chat.

3053
03:32:30,030 --> 03:32:30,790
Thank you, thank you.

3054
03:32:31,330 --> 03:32:34,510
But how do you get the fucking body ending though?

3055
03:32:35,430 --> 03:32:36,730
Oh, you have to leave James.

3056
03:32:36,890 --> 03:32:37,870
Oh my god.

3057
03:32:39,850 --> 03:32:40,250
Wait.

3058
03:32:41,150 --> 03:32:43,290
I just wasted...

3059
03:32:43,930 --> 03:32:47,010
Okay, first off, she died three days ago.

3060
03:32:47,330 --> 03:32:53,430
So like, the smell of that would not be the best, to be fair.

3061
03:32:53,570 --> 03:32:58,710
Like, I think if Laura gets near the car, she's gonna realize something is very wrong.

3062
03:33:02,510 --> 03:33:03,590
Not so fun fact.

3063
03:33:03,690 --> 03:33:06,590
It's kinda confirmed that Angela endgamed herself a bit after the ending.

3064
03:33:06,690 --> 03:33:08,170
Also, dog ending when?

3065
03:33:08,350 --> 03:33:09,670
D-Dragon, thank you for the super chat.

3066
03:33:09,750 --> 03:33:10,450
Thank you, thank you.

3067
03:33:10,450 --> 03:33:14,130
I can watch the YouTube video of it right now and pretend I got it.

3068
03:33:14,170 --> 03:33:15,410
Thank you for the super chat.

3069
03:33:15,510 --> 03:33:16,770
Thank you, thank you.

3070
03:33:16,990 --> 03:33:18,630
Is there an after credit scene, chat?

3071
03:33:20,250 --> 03:33:22,010
Chat, is there an after credit scene?

3072
03:33:28,660 --> 03:33:29,940
Cosmic, thank you for the super chat.

3073
03:33:30,060 --> 03:33:30,900
Thank you, thank you.

3074
03:33:30,980 --> 03:33:33,320
God of War, I guess you wonder where I've been.

3075
03:33:33,640 --> 03:33:35,920
Oh yeah, we're going back to Data War.

3076
03:33:36,500 --> 03:33:41,980
I was debating like, like, like delaying God of War again for Indiana Jones.

3077
03:33:42,020 --> 03:33:43,920
Cause that's coming next week as well.

3078
03:33:43,920 --> 03:33:49,780
But then I realized, God of War fans have sort of like, waited for a very long time.

3079
03:33:49,900 --> 03:33:52,180
Like some of them have actually become dads now.

3080
03:33:52,480 --> 03:33:54,140
So, Doki, no!

3081
03:33:55,500 --> 03:33:57,620
That would've been so fucked up.

3082
03:33:57,680 --> 03:34:00,540
I would be like, sorry guys, we gotta play Indiana Jones now.

3083
03:34:00,640 --> 03:34:01,620
It just came out.

3084
03:34:04,600 --> 03:34:12,640
We just keep, we keep like, playing games until like, every time we finish a game, a newer game comes out.

3085
03:34:12,640 --> 03:34:15,000
So I'm like, sorry guys, FOMO time.

3086
03:34:21,500 --> 03:34:27,360
That would be so fucked up.

3087
03:34:27,640 --> 03:34:28,840
Anyway, let's make a poll.

3088
03:34:39,400 --> 03:34:41,940
You guys can decide the fate.

3089
03:34:44,820 --> 03:34:47,340
By the way, is there, is there an after credit scene?

3090
03:34:50,830 --> 03:34:51,850
God of Baiting.

3091
03:34:51,930 --> 03:34:53,290
Thank you for the super chat, Kiwi.

03:34:58,110 --> 03:34:59,450
Hey guys, thank you for the super chat.

03:34:59,510 --> 03:35:00,030
Thank you, thank you.

3099
03:35:00,070 --> 03:35:01,290
I recommend playing the original.

3100
03:35:01,550 --> 03:35:03,850
Phenomenal voice acting and way less padding.

3101
03:35:04,210 --> 03:35:04,930
Thank you for the super chat.

3102
03:35:05,010 --> 03:35:05,550
Thank you, thank you.

3103
03:35:05,570 --> 03:35:07,950
I spike voted this poll.

3104
03:35:08,370 --> 03:35:10,350
You are so evil.

3105
03:35:11,350 --> 03:35:13,070
Guys, wouldn't it be funny?

3106
03:35:13,070 --> 03:35:15,310
Every time we finish a new game.

3107
03:35:15,470 --> 03:35:18,010
Another new game keeps coming out.

3108
03:35:22,250 --> 03:35:25,270
Another new game keeps coming out.

3109
03:35:25,790 --> 03:35:29,510
And then we'll never get the God of War.

3110
03:35:31,450 --> 03:35:34,110
There's a new Indiana Jones game coming out next week.

3111
03:35:34,210 --> 03:35:36,070
I mean, it's coming out tomorrow actually.

3112
03:35:36,470 --> 03:35:37,950
I'm not playing it on like tomorrow.

3113
03:35:38,230 --> 03:35:39,810
Like, I know I usually play on launch day.

3114
03:35:40,130 --> 03:35:42,290
But like, I'm not gonna play it tomorrow.

3115
03:35:42,290 --> 03:35:47,190
How long to beat Indiana Jones game?

3116
03:35:48,310 --> 03:35:48,970
Let's see.

3117
03:35:49,050 --> 03:35:50,030
It says 12.

3118
03:35:50,130 --> 03:35:51,170
12 to 6.

3119
03:35:51,350 --> 03:35:52,230
12 hours.

3120
03:35:52,550 --> 03:35:53,490
It's not that bad.

3121
03:35:54,170 --> 03:35:55,030
12 hours?

3122
03:35:55,630 --> 03:35:59,330
Oh my god!

3123
03:35:59,770 --> 03:36:01,610
Wait, boy is actually winning!

3124
03:36:03,860 --> 03:36:05,310
Wait, is it actually...

3125
03:36:05,310 --> 03:36:06,350

3126
03:36:07,050 --> 03:36:11,490
Indiana Jones and the Great Circle reviews.

3127
03:36:11,490 --> 03:36:12,930

3128
03:36:13,310 --> 03:36:13,490

3129
03:36:14,130 --> 03:36:14,730

03:36:17,450 --> 03:36:19,230
5 out of 5!

3132
03:36:19,610 --> 03:36:20,930
9 out of 10!

3133
03:36:21,330 --> 03:36:24,810
Wait, the reviews are actually really fucking good!

3134
03:36:28,320 --> 03:36:31,480
It's like 9 out of 10, 9 out of 10, and 5 out of 5.

3135
03:36:32,980 --> 03:36:34,900
But, but, but boy.

3136
03:36:36,300 --> 03:36:38,240
But, but boy though.

3137
03:36:40,520 --> 03:36:41,280
Let's see.

3138
03:36:41,420 --> 03:36:41,860
Oh my god.

3139
03:36:41,860 --> 03:36:43,900
The number of times I checked the map.

3140
03:36:50,400 --> 03:36:51,080
600.

3141
03:36:52,220 --> 03:36:54,520
Guys, I was really lost, guys.

3142
03:36:55,080 --> 03:37:00,100
I, I was, I was really, really fucking lost, chat.

3143
03:37:00,180 --> 03:37:01,180
You don't understand.

3144
03:37:01,880 --> 03:37:03,400
You don't understand.

3145
03:37:06,040 --> 03:37:09,760
Okay, I killed 365, 87, 26, 28.

3146
03:37:09,760 --> 03:37:13,920
I got damaged 3,945.

3147
03:37:17,640 --> 03:37:19,740
You're getting access to new game plus.

3148
03:37:20,180 --> 03:37:20,780
It's okay.

3149
03:37:21,640 --> 03:37:24,500
Oh my god, I'm so happy we finally did it.

3150
03:37:24,940 --> 03:37:26,040
Brian, thank you for the super chat.

3151
03:37:26,100 --> 03:37:27,040
Thank you, thank you.

3152
03:37:27,200 --> 03:37:28,300
It's my birthday, super.

3153
03:37:28,480 --> 03:37:30,440
I had so much fun watching you play through Silent Hill 2.

3154
03:37:30,520 --> 03:37:31,820
Thank you for the super chat.

3155
03:37:31,960 --> 03:37:33,880
Brian, happy birthday to you.

3156
03:37:34,220 --> 03:37:35,800
Happy birthday to you.

3157
03:37:36,120 --> 03:37:37,800
Happy birthday, dear Brian.

3158
03:37:38,400 --> 03:37:39,980
Happy birthday to you.

3159
03:37:40,440 --> 03:37:40,860
Yeah!

3160
03:37:41,740 --> 03:37:42,560
Happy birthday!

3161
03:37:44,520 --> 03:37:49,680
Um, honestly, I'm like, I'm so surprised I managed to, like, beat the game.

3162
03:37:51,080 --> 03:37:55,260
Um, like, as fast as I thought it, as I thought.

3163
03:37:55,360 --> 03:37:57,720
Because I honestly thought it was going to take like five to six hours.

3164
03:37:58,260 --> 03:37:59,460
With the rate I was, oh my god.

3165
03:37:59,600 --> 03:38:00,960
Whoops, I forgot to put these away.

3166
03:38:01,220 --> 03:38:04,890
With the rate I was going on the other playthroughs.

3167
03:38:04,890 --> 03:38:08,750
I think I was so determined to finally put this behind me.

3168
03:38:08,830 --> 03:38:10,090
I was like, I can't.

3169
03:38:10,270 --> 03:38:13,110
In my head, I was just like, I can't keep doing this.

3170
03:38:13,410 --> 03:38:16,370
I can't, I can't keep being stuck in Silent Hill.

3171
03:38:16,670 --> 03:38:18,970
I gotta, I gotta get through this.

3172
03:38:19,330 --> 03:38:21,990
I gotta make it through.

3173
03:38:23,490 --> 03:38:25,150
Oh yeah, thank you again for the super chat.

3174
03:38:25,270 --> 03:38:26,190
Thank you, thank you.

3175
03:38:26,370 --> 03:38:28,510
Oh yeah, I'll show you the photo that Goomy sent me.

3176
03:38:28,610 --> 03:38:30,210
She's like at the place now.

3177
03:38:30,750 --> 03:38:32,450
Um, she's sitting with Sage at him too.

3178
03:38:32,450 --> 03:38:35,430
Oh my god, there's like free food and everything.

3179
03:38:36,190 --> 03:38:37,390
I couldn't go there.

3180
03:38:37,490 --> 03:38:40,390
I was so busy with like everything else.

3181
03:38:41,110 --> 03:38:43,890
Um, oh I didn't get, oh yeah, people got interview.

3182
03:38:44,030 --> 03:38:45,450
I didn't get interview spot though.

3183
03:38:46,130 --> 03:38:49,530
Um, because I said like if I get an interview, just call me.

3184
03:38:51,210 --> 03:38:52,890
I see like Nicewig.

3185
03:38:53,130 --> 03:38:54,050
Nicewig got an interview.

3186
03:38:54,890 --> 03:38:55,750
Look, there's me.

3187
03:38:57,470 --> 03:38:58,990
There's me, I'm sitting there.

3188
03:38:59,090 --> 03:39:00,410
There's Nicewig right here.

3189
03:39:01,490 --> 03:39:04,490
Nicewig is literally right here, getting interviewed right now.

3190
03:39:04,910 --> 03:39:06,770
And then look, there's free food.

3191
03:39:06,770 --> 03:39:08,310
Oh my god, don't look at the QR code.

3192
03:39:10,810 --> 03:39:11,830
Oh my god.

3193
03:39:12,190 --> 03:39:15,250
But she got my, basically she gets free food.

3194
03:39:15,410 --> 03:39:18,670
Because like, it's my, I gave her my spot.

3195
03:39:19,910 --> 03:39:22,030
And then there's Sage at him, taking picture with me.

3196
03:39:22,590 --> 03:39:26,730
Um, I gave her like, um, my spot for it.

3197
03:39:26,930 --> 03:39:28,770
Uh, because Goomy asked me for it.

3198
03:39:28,770 --> 03:39:29,830
And I was like, yeah, that's cool.

3199
03:39:29,950 --> 03:39:31,010
Because I'm not going anyway.

3200
03:39:31,590 --> 03:39:33,830
Um, because like, there'll be cameras everywhere.

3201
03:39:34,210 --> 03:39:41,890
And like, I know like there's some Vtubers that bounce between like Fleshy and, uh, Fleshy and like Vtubing.

3202
03:39:42,310 --> 03:39:44,970
But like, um, for me, I like to keep privacy.

3203
03:39:45,250 --> 03:39:47,610
I'm more of, I'm a very private person in general.

3204
03:39:47,910 --> 03:39:52,310
So for me, like, um, I like to have like, you know, more privacy for it.

3205
03:39:52,310 --> 03:39:55,510
Because QT was like telling me how like, oh yeah, the cameras are gonna be everywhere.

3206
03:39:56,130 --> 03:39:59,310
And like, there's gonna be cameras panning towards you and stuff like that.

3207
03:39:59,650 --> 03:40:06,750
And so like, usually we don't like, we, we, uh, we understand for Vtubers if you don't wanna, if you don't wanna come.

3208
03:40:06,930 --> 03:40:07,990
And I was like, yeah.

3209
03:40:10,970 --> 03:40:14,430
And like, Goomy asked me about it because she wanted to be my plus one for it.

3210
03:40:14,610 --> 03:40:15,830
But I wasn't gonna go anyway.

3211
03:40:16,130 --> 03:40:17,350
So then I just gave her my ticket.

3212
03:40:17,510 --> 03:40:20,650
Like, I gave her my, um, thing because she wanted to go too.

3213
03:40:22,870 --> 03:40:26,870
Um, uh, so like, I was just like, yeah, you can just go as me.

3214
03:40:27,170 --> 03:40:28,610
Um, as long as you carry me around.

3215
03:40:29,070 --> 03:40:30,550
Uh, I was just like, just carry me around.

3216
03:40:30,610 --> 03:40:31,510
I'm cool with that.

3217
03:40:32,710 --> 03:40:33,150
Like...

3218
03:40:34,530 --> 03:40:39,630
So people know like, like, like, you know, at least I was sort of there.

3219
03:40:39,910 --> 03:40:42,270
Um, and she gets free food too.

3220
03:40:42,730 --> 03:40:45,270
Also like, I have to travel so much.

3221
03:40:45,270 --> 03:40:53,850
Like, cause like, at first, Sejam said that I could, like, Goomy told me that Sejam told her that I could like, hang out at Sejam's place.

3222
03:40:54,050 --> 03:40:55,530
And like, use their setup.

3223
03:40:55,870 --> 03:40:56,790
And then I'll just go around.

3224
03:40:56,890 --> 03:40:59,190
Like, I'll still be like, in LA.

3225
03:40:59,590 --> 03:41:00,430
And I'll just go around.

3226
03:41:00,490 --> 03:41:02,790
Like, I'll just call in from like, Sejam's place.

3227
03:41:03,110 --> 03:41:05,050
And then I could just still be there, technically.

3228
03:41:05,350 --> 03:41:07,630
But then I was just like, I don't wanna travel.

3229
03:41:07,770 --> 03:41:10,410
Like, I'm gonna be traveling so much.

3230
03:41:10,850 --> 03:41:15,410
Um, like, cause I'm gonna be traveling again next week, literally, to Atlanta for the concert.

3231
03:41:15,670 --> 03:41:20,290
So like, I'm just like, I don't wanna, I don't wanna travel again.

3232
03:41:20,510 --> 03:41:24,510
Like, go to LA, and then come back, and then go to Atlanta.

3233
03:41:24,790 --> 03:41:27,410
Cause I'm so, I hate traveling in general.

3234
03:41:27,870 --> 03:41:31,150
Um, so I was just like...

3235
03:41:32,170 --> 03:41:37,070
Yeah, but then they're like saying like, cause there's an after party.

3236
03:41:37,590 --> 03:41:41,110
Um, there's an after party, after the thing.

3237
03:41:41,390 --> 03:41:42,690
After the whole Streamer Awards.

3238
03:41:43,070 --> 03:41:44,970
There's gonna be like, an after party.

3239
03:41:45,230 --> 03:41:48,110
So like, I could technically go to the after party, cause there's no cameras there.

3240
03:41:48,450 --> 03:41:51,230
Um, and there's no like, but I just didn't wanna travel at all.

3241
03:41:51,310 --> 03:41:55,730
Like, I just, I was just, I just wanna stay at home until I have to fucking go to Atlanta.

3242
03:41:56,210 --> 03:41:56,610
Like...

3243
03:41:57,950 --> 03:42:01,310
Cause the last time I traveled, I got sick.

3244
03:42:01,690 --> 03:42:04,450
So I was just like, I wanna make sure I don't get sick for Atlanta.

3245
03:42:04,450 --> 03:42:07,230
So like, that's why I also don't wanna travel right now.

3246
03:42:07,270 --> 03:42:09,370
Cause I wanna make sure that I don't get sick again.

3247
03:42:10,530 --> 03:42:13,170
Um, I'm not, I don't like traveling a lot too.

3248
03:42:13,270 --> 03:42:14,990
I like just staying at home.

3249
03:42:16,270 --> 03:42:20,810
Um, yeah, so that's why I was just, like, I was just like, eh, it's fine.

3250
03:42:20,890 --> 03:42:22,050
I don't really care that much.

3251
03:42:22,450 --> 03:42:23,870
Um, I'm feeling a lot better.

3252
03:42:24,190 --> 03:42:26,370
Uh, cough me, I don't cough as much.

3253
03:42:26,630 --> 03:42:28,810
But my throat is still like, sore in general.

3254
03:42:29,270 --> 03:42:32,310
So, like, I'm getting better.

3255
03:42:32,310 --> 03:42:35,090
Obviously, I could get a lot better faster.

3256
03:42:35,290 --> 03:42:37,210
But like, if I went to the doctors.

3257
03:42:37,770 --> 03:42:39,710
Um, but I'm just toughing it out.

3258
03:42:40,010 --> 03:42:43,190
If I'm still sick when I'm in Atlanta, I'm gonna go see a doctor in Atlanta.

3259
03:42:43,870 --> 03:42:48,170
That's why, if I'm still sick when I'm in Atlanta, I'll go see a doctor.

3260
03:42:48,550 --> 03:42:51,310
But for now, I'm toughing it out right now.

3261
03:42:51,670 --> 03:42:53,010
Oh yeah, how's the passport?

3262
03:42:53,210 --> 03:42:53,890
Not so great.

3263
03:42:54,030 --> 03:42:58,750
I'm gonna go try on Monday to see if I can, uh...

3264
03:42:58,750 --> 03:43:03,890
Like, cause like, I read that like, when I throw in an application for my passport.

3265
03:43:04,590 --> 03:43:07,970
Um, cause my passport doesn't expire until after.

3266
03:43:08,490 --> 03:43:10,830
So like, um, after Atlanta.

3267
03:43:11,150 --> 03:43:12,310
So like, it should be fine.

3268
03:43:12,850 --> 03:43:15,490
Um, so like, I'm not too worried about that.

3269
03:43:15,750 --> 03:43:22,990
It's just that I, I gotta like, make sure that I can use my passport like, in like, upcoming months.

3270
03:43:23,030 --> 03:43:24,950
Because I don't, I think I'm gonna have to travel again.

3271
03:43:25,270 --> 03:43:26,530
Um, in the beginning of 2025.

3272
03:43:26,530 --> 03:43:28,590
So that's like, what I'm really worried about.

3273
03:43:28,810 --> 03:43:30,550
Um, so I'm gonna have to get there on Monday.

3274
03:43:30,730 --> 03:43:32,710
Like, when the place opens.

3275
03:43:32,990 --> 03:43:34,850
Basically, I fucking, oh my god.

3276
03:43:34,950 --> 03:43:37,130
I, I hate doing passport stuff.

3277
03:43:37,190 --> 03:43:39,330
It's been so long too, since I did passport stuff.

3278
03:43:39,390 --> 03:43:41,850
So then I'm just like, filling the forms and everything.

3279
03:43:42,070 --> 03:43:42,510
Ah!

3280
03:43:45,150 --> 03:43:47,510
Oh yeah, there's so many announcements.

3281
03:43:47,890 --> 03:43:50,130
Because like, oh wait.

3282
03:43:51,370 --> 03:43:53,730
Oh yeah, here, Gumi's holding me.

3283
03:43:54,250 --> 03:43:54,810

3284
03:43:56,270 --> 03:43:57,590
Yeah, that's me.

3285
03:43:58,390 --> 03:43:59,050
That's me.

3286
03:43:59,210 --> 03:44:00,290
Oh yeah, by the way, like.

3287
03:44:00,510 --> 03:44:02,250
They're like, oh yeah, put your name in.

3288
03:44:02,290 --> 03:44:03,370
So when we check your ID.

3289
03:44:04,130 --> 03:44:06,230
Like, uh, we know that you're you.

3290
03:44:06,470 --> 03:44:07,990
And then I just put her name on it.

3291
03:44:08,150 --> 03:44:10,890
Cause, haha, she's technically Doki Bird right now.

3292
03:44:14,690 --> 03:44:15,870

Oh, I could've just asked her to bring a cut out version of me.

3327
03:45:32,650 --> 03:45:34,450
But like I'm not actually there.

Wait, you never heard of that?

3329

Like I remember like seeing like prom photos.

3330
03:45:42,950 --> 03:45:44,530
Of like, like teenagers.

3331
03:45:44,930 --> 03:45:45,950
Who don't have a date.

3332
03:45:46,230 --> 03:45:47,110
Like who have like.

3333
03:45:47,110 --> 03:45:48,830
Who are like super obsessed with celebrities.

3334
03:45:49,190 --> 03:45:51,470
And they like print out a picture of their face.

3335
03:45:51,630 --> 03:45:53,430
And then like paste it on like some.

3336
03:45:53,750 --> 03:45:54,190
Something.

03:45:54,650 --> 03:45:56,250
And then be like this is my date.

3338
03:45:56,570 --> 03:45:56,850
Like.

3339
03:45:58,950 --> 03:46:01,330

Print it out and then paste it in.

3343
03:46:06,330 --> 03:46:07,610

3345
03:46:10,050 --> 03:46:10,530
Oh

3347
03:46:15,750 --> 03:46:16,910
We have seen those, yeah.

03:46:18,130 --> 03:46:18,970
Okay, wait.

3350
03:46:21,870 --> 03:46:22,750
This one.

3351
03:46:23,110 --> 03:46:24,990
This person brought Danny DeVito.

3352
03:46:25,350 --> 03:46:26,930
This is basically how I see it.

3353
03:46:27,070 --> 03:46:28,770
How I see it for Gumi.

3354
03:46:29,470 --> 03:46:29,970
Um.

3355
03:46:30,190 --> 03:46:31,150
This is what it looks like.

3356
03:46:32,090 --> 03:46:34,050
This girl brought Danny DeVito to prom.

3357
03:46:34,610 --> 03:46:35,870
That's me and Gumi.

3358
03:46:36,490 --> 03:46:36,710
That's.

3359
03:46:43,430 --> 03:46:45,470
That's basically me and Gumi.

3360
03:46:45,470 --> 03:46:46,290
That's me right now.

3361
03:46:50,090 --> 03:46:51,490
That's how I see it.

3362
03:46:52,130 --> 03:46:53,610
Oh wait, what the fuck?

3363
03:46:53,730 --> 03:46:57,050
Oh my god, my mouse is freaking out right now.

3364
03:46:57,390 --> 03:46:57,870
Woah!

3365
03:46:58,130 --> 03:46:58,490
Give me a second.

3366
03:46:58,730 --> 03:47:00,930
My mouse is freaking out.

3367
03:47:00,930 --> 03:47:02,910
My mouse is freaking out.

3368
03:47:04,770 --> 03:47:05,690
Oh my god.

3369
03:47:06,610 --> 03:47:06,910
Okay.

3370
03:47:08,170 --> 03:47:09,710
Wait, what happened to my tab?

3371
03:47:11,250 --> 03:47:13,590
It like closed like my entire window.

3372
03:47:15,430 --> 03:47:17,210
I might need to buy a new mouse.

3373
03:47:17,410 --> 03:47:17,790
Cause like.

3374
03:47:17,830 --> 03:47:19,630
It like freaked out.

3375
03:47:19,750 --> 03:47:22,290
Cause it kept like left clicking by itself.

3376
03:47:22,530 --> 03:47:23,830
On the right side.

3377
03:47:24,230 --> 03:47:26,590
So like I think there's something wrong with like the.

3378
03:47:26,850 --> 03:47:27,290
Um.

3379
03:47:28,430 --> 03:47:29,990
The connection or something.

3380
03:47:30,110 --> 03:47:31,210
Cause I have, mine's wireless.

3381
03:47:31,610 --> 03:47:33,390
There's something wrong with the wireless stuff.

3382
03:47:33,830 --> 03:47:34,990
Cause it does that sometimes.

3383
03:47:35,050 --> 03:47:35,750
Every like.

3384
03:47:36,090 --> 03:47:39,730
It does that like sometimes but it doesn't do it frequently.

3385
03:47:40,130 --> 03:47:41,730
So maybe like a month or two.

3386
03:47:41,730 --> 03:47:43,270
Or maybe the battery is low.

3387
03:47:43,350 --> 03:47:44,350
I didn't charge it in a while.

3388
03:47:44,450 --> 03:47:44,930
Let me check.

3389
03:47:45,990 --> 03:47:47,050
Let me check the battery.

3390
03:47:48,630 --> 03:47:49,910
No, it's 47%.

3391
03:47:49,910 --> 03:47:50,530
I think my.

3392
03:47:50,670 --> 03:47:51,990
It's just fucking freaking.

3393
03:47:52,090 --> 03:47:53,250
It's just getting old.

3394
03:47:53,850 --> 03:47:54,210
Um.

3395
03:47:55,330 --> 03:47:56,850
But yeah, I hope she has fun.

3396
03:47:57,110 --> 03:47:59,010
I hope she has fun at the streamer awards.

3397
03:47:59,430 --> 03:48:01,250
I think that's the only sad thing.

3398
03:48:01,310 --> 03:48:02,570
About being a Vtuber.

3399
03:48:03,010 --> 03:48:05,170
Is that obviously you miss out on like.

3400
03:48:05,210 --> 03:48:07,730
A lot of these like physical events and stuff.

3401
03:48:07,790 --> 03:48:08,810
Because like I don't.

3402
03:48:08,810 --> 03:48:09,450
I don't like.

3403
03:48:09,930 --> 03:48:11,490
I'm like a really private person.

3404
03:48:11,730 --> 03:48:13,490
So like I don't want people to know.

3405
03:48:13,750 --> 03:48:14,890
Where I live.

3406
03:48:16,310 --> 03:48:17,930
What I look like.

3407
03:48:18,010 --> 03:48:20,030
Outside of the skin suit and stuff.

3408
03:48:20,350 --> 03:48:22,070
So like I don't want people to spot me.

3409
03:48:22,230 --> 03:48:22,710
And be like.

3410
03:48:22,990 --> 03:48:24,310
That's Doki Bird.

3411
03:48:24,710 --> 03:48:26,910
So I'm a very private person when it comes to that.

3412
03:48:27,430 --> 03:48:29,050
And I don't like having.

3413
03:48:29,290 --> 03:48:30,210
Cause I've like denied.

3414
03:48:30,630 --> 03:48:32,590
I remember like Respawn has like.

3415
03:48:32,690 --> 03:48:34,450
Asked me so many times.

3416
03:48:34,450 --> 03:48:36,430
To like visit their facilities.

3417
03:48:36,930 --> 03:48:37,470
And like visit.

3418
03:48:39,530 --> 03:48:40,650
Visit their offices.

3419
03:48:41,050 --> 03:48:42,630
But like it would also have like.

3420
03:48:42,750 --> 03:48:44,470
There would be other content creators too.

3421
03:48:44,810 --> 03:48:46,610
So like I always get like.

3422
03:48:46,770 --> 03:48:47,930
Super paranoid cause I was like.

3423
03:48:47,990 --> 03:48:50,130
I don't really want to be like filmed or like.

3424
03:48:50,270 --> 03:48:51,610
I don't want pictures of me.

3425
03:48:51,950 --> 03:48:52,910
With other content creators.

3426
03:48:52,970 --> 03:48:55,770
Especially content creators that I don't know in general.

3427
03:48:56,210 --> 03:48:58,450
I'll be like oh I don't really know who they are.

3428
03:48:58,570 --> 03:48:59,570
So like I feel a little.

3429
03:48:59,850 --> 03:49:02,110
I feel a little like weird.

3430
03:49:02,110 --> 03:49:04,130
About it because I don't want these people.

3431
03:49:04,270 --> 03:49:06,570
Who I don't really know what I look like.

3432
03:49:06,710 --> 03:49:07,830
Like I don't want them to see me.

3433
03:49:07,850 --> 03:49:09,250
Without my skin suit.

3434
03:49:11,770 --> 03:49:13,630
I actually got messaged.

3435
03:49:14,050 --> 03:49:14,670
By like.

3436
03:49:15,170 --> 03:49:18,430
Cause I got my YouTube partner manager.

3437
03:49:18,950 --> 03:49:20,530
Like send me a message.

3438
03:49:20,790 --> 03:49:21,250
And they were like.

3439
03:49:21,330 --> 03:49:23,690
Oh my god we're having a meet up.

3440
03:49:23,790 --> 03:49:25,230
With all the other YouTubers.

3441
03:49:25,450 --> 03:49:27,510
All the other YouTubers in your city.

3442
03:49:28,070 --> 03:49:29,230
Would you like to like.

3443
03:49:29,230 --> 03:49:30,210
Do you want to come?

3444
03:49:30,330 --> 03:49:31,390
There's going to be free food.

3445
03:49:31,510 --> 03:49:33,170
And you get to network with other YouTubers.

3446
03:49:33,650 --> 03:49:35,530
I was like I don't know.

3447
03:49:35,670 --> 03:49:36,070
I don't really.

3448
03:49:37,890 --> 03:49:38,730
I'm sorry.

3449
03:49:38,870 --> 03:49:40,610
I don't really want them to know.

3450
03:49:41,990 --> 03:49:42,950
That's weird.

3451
03:49:43,210 --> 03:49:44,410
I don't know for me.

3452
03:49:44,690 --> 03:49:45,810
I don't want them to know.

3453
03:49:46,090 --> 03:49:47,250
I live here.

3454
03:49:47,690 --> 03:49:49,630
They know what I like.

3455
03:49:51,130 --> 03:49:52,090
I'm sorry.

3456
03:49:52,290 --> 03:49:52,970
I can't.

3457
03:49:56,490 --> 03:49:57,090
she's not even a YouTuber either.

3458
03:49:57,090 --> 03:49:57,450
And they're like.

3459
03:49:57,750 --> 03:49:58,190
You can pretend.

3460
03:49:58,370 --> 03:49:59,550
To be like her manager.

3461
03:49:59,890 --> 03:50:00,090
You know.

3462
03:50:00,250 --> 03:50:03,450
Like Doki birds manager.

3463
03:50:03,790 --> 03:50:04,930
As her representative.

3464
03:50:06,570 --> 03:50:07,770
Oh man.

3465
03:50:08,070 --> 03:50:09,070
That's so awkward.

3466
03:50:09,150 --> 03:50:09,990
That the manager sounds.

3467
03:50:10,330 --> 03:50:11,490
Exactly like her.

3468
03:50:14,910 --> 03:50:16,510
I was just like.

3469
03:50:16,510 --> 03:50:17,490
I didn't say that but.

3470
03:50:17,630 --> 03:50:18,410
In my head.

3471
03:50:18,410 --> 03:50:20,870
I was like, how the fuck is that supposed to work?

3472
03:50:20,990 --> 03:50:24,110
I have to talk to people that can sound exactly like me.

3473
03:50:24,410 --> 03:50:28,910
I was like, no, it's alright.

3474
03:50:29,190 --> 03:50:30,210
No, I don't need to go.

3475
03:50:30,390 --> 03:50:33,030
I don't really care that much, to be fair.

3476
03:50:36,110 --> 03:50:45,950
But yeah, I mean, it would've been nice to be able to go to the streamer awards just for the sake of like, you know, You know, hanging out and like, you know, it's like, it looks like a really cool event.

3477
03:50:45,950 --> 03:50:52,430
I think like, getting, being able to go to the streamer awards seems to be like, a really cool, um...

3478
03:50:52,950 --> 03:50:55,210
A really cool opportunity in general.

3479
03:50:55,630 --> 03:50:57,490
So it's like, uh...

3480
03:50:57,490 --> 03:51:02,270
So it's more so of like, I do, I feel a bit sad that I couldn't like, go there, um...

3481
03:51:02,270 --> 03:51:04,890
Because of the cameras and stuff and everything will be streamed and everything.

3482
03:51:05,230 --> 03:51:07,590
But it's like, the sacrifices I have to make, you know.

3483
03:51:10,290 --> 03:51:15,310
The sacrifices I have to make to keep my privacy, um...

3484
03:51:17,910 --> 03:51:19,250
But yeah, uh, anyway.

3485
03:51:19,630 --> 03:51:20,790
Super chat reading time!

3486
03:51:21,130 --> 03:51:24,890
I don't know if I can get through all of it, because I want to rest my voice, because I have some recording stuff to do after.

3487
03:51:25,210 --> 03:51:27,250
So I'm gonna do like, five super chats.

3488
03:51:27,470 --> 03:51:28,430
Uh, I hope that's okay.

3489
03:51:30,230 --> 03:51:30,590
Um...

3490
03:51:30,990 --> 03:51:31,350
Mike!

3491
03:51:31,830 --> 03:51:33,670
Doki beat Solid Hill 2 remake.

3492
03:51:33,930 --> 03:51:34,290
Yippee!

3493
03:51:34,510 --> 03:51:35,350
Thank you for the super chat.

3494
03:51:35,430 --> 03:51:36,210
Thank you, thank you.

3495
03:51:36,590 --> 03:51:36,950
Rosie!

3496
03:51:37,210 --> 03:51:38,070
Thank you for the super chat.

3497
03:51:38,170 --> 03:51:38,870
Thank you, thank you.

3498
03:51:38,930 --> 03:51:40,710
You treat your wife well, Doki.

3499
03:51:41,710 --> 03:51:42,430
Uh, Gavrange!

3500
03:51:42,650 --> 03:51:43,490
Thank you for the super chat.

3501
03:51:43,610 --> 03:51:44,390
Thank you, thank you.

3502
03:51:44,390 --> 03:51:46,390
Doki Bird, more like Dochi Bird.

3503
03:51:46,570 --> 03:51:47,130
Thank you for the super chat.

3504
03:51:47,210 --> 03:51:48,230
Thank you, thank you.

3505
03:51:48,510 --> 03:51:49,990
Oh, okay, so God of War.

3506
03:51:50,310 --> 03:51:52,250
We're going back to God of War, guys.

3507
03:51:52,390 --> 03:51:53,190
We're gonna go back.

3508
03:51:53,330 --> 03:51:54,630
He's, he's won.

3509
03:51:55,210 --> 03:51:57,050
Indiana Jones fans, I'm sorry.

3510
03:51:57,630 --> 03:51:58,830
No FOMO for you.

3511
03:51:59,790 --> 03:52:04,790
For once, there's no more, there's no FOMO for you, Indiana Jones fans.

3512
03:52:04,870 --> 03:52:05,610
You gotta wait.

3513
03:52:06,990 --> 03:52:08,370
You gotta fucking wait.

3514
03:52:11,210 --> 03:52:12,090
Um, Wristwatch!

3515
03:52:12,290 --> 03:52:12,910
Thank you for the super chat.

3516
03:52:13,010 --> 03:52:13,750
Thank you, thank you.

3517
03:52:13,850 --> 03:52:16,250
Uphold democracy or succumb to FOMO.

3518
03:52:16,670 --> 03:52:17,670
Choose, Doki!

3519
03:52:19,670 --> 03:52:21,030
Um, thank you for the super chat.

3520
03:52:21,130 --> 03:52:21,890
Thank you, thank you.

3521
03:52:22,350 --> 03:52:23,530
Uh, Funilus!

3522
03:52:23,630 --> 03:52:24,350
Thank you for the super chat.

3523
03:52:24,450 --> 03:52:25,030
Thank you, thank you.

3524
03:52:25,370 --> 03:52:27,430
333 times you try to open locked doors.

3525
03:52:27,590 --> 03:52:30,010
Hey, they could be open, chat!

3526
03:52:30,670 --> 03:52:33,390
I mean, maybe, maybe it'll be open.

3527
03:52:33,710 --> 03:52:34,530
You don't know that.

3528
03:52:34,670 --> 03:52:38,090
They might be like, huh, JK, it's actually unlocked now.

3529
03:52:40,150 --> 03:52:41,510
But thank you again for the super chat.

3530
03:52:41,630 --> 03:52:42,570
Thank you, thank you.

3531
03:52:45,390 --> 03:52:47,230
Um, all right, last super chat.

3532
03:52:47,350 --> 03:52:48,750
Last super chat of the day.

3533
03:52:49,150 --> 03:52:49,410
Niel!

3534
03:52:49,590 --> 03:52:50,430
Thank you for the super chat.

3535
03:52:50,490 --> 03:52:51,290
Thank you, thank you.

3536
03:52:51,510 --> 03:52:53,930
Congrats on finally finishing Silent Hill 2.

3537
03:52:54,090 --> 03:52:56,250
This should be like, guys, this should be a celebration.

3538
03:52:56,810 --> 03:53:00,630
It took me eight fucking parts to finish this game, chat.

3539
03:53:00,970 --> 03:53:09,430
Like, I- I- almost every stream, I did two to three hours every time I streamed.

3540
03:53:09,570 --> 03:53:12,310
Because my heart was just- I couldn't take it.

3541
03:53:12,390 --> 03:53:13,350
It was too much.

3542
03:53:13,710 --> 03:53:15,950
It was too fucking much, guys.

3543
03:53:16,150 --> 03:53:17,870
But we did it, chat.

3544
03:53:18,730 --> 03:53:20,530
Out of eight streams.

3545
03:53:21,110 --> 03:53:23,090
Eight streams, two months.

3546
03:53:23,650 --> 03:53:30,230
Um, many dragoons getting married, many dragoons finding love, many dragoons having children.

3547
03:53:30,830 --> 03:53:32,450
Um, we fucking did it.

3548
03:53:32,530 --> 03:53:37,190
Now your kids can watch the entire, uh, playthrough of Silent Hill 2.

3549
03:53:37,490 --> 03:53:41,110
And they don't have to, like, wait until they also have kids until it's over.

3550
03:53:41,510 --> 03:53:42,770
Uh, but thank you again for the super chat.

3551
03:53:42,870 --> 03:53:43,510
Thank you, thank you.

3552
03:53:43,990 --> 03:53:45,650
Um, on the topic- oh yeah, Niel.

3553
03:53:45,690 --> 03:53:46,510
Thank you again for the super chat.

3554
03:53:46,590 --> 03:53:47,070
Thank you, thank you.

3555
03:53:47,130 --> 03:53:48,790
On the topic of ending, there's no true ending.

3556
03:53:48,970 --> 03:53:52,570
It is confirmed by the original dev that every ending is canon.

3557
03:53:52,810 --> 03:53:54,150
Yes, including the dog one.

3558
03:53:54,250 --> 03:53:55,010
Thank you for the super chat.

3559
03:53:55,070 --> 03:53:55,730
Thank you, thank you.

3560
03:53:55,730 --> 03:54:01,750
Well, technically, I could see, like, them find- him finding a bod- him having the body in the back of his trunk.

3561
03:54:01,930 --> 03:54:05,530
And also, like, the good ending with the Laura thing.

3562
03:54:05,810 --> 03:54:09,950
Like, they are- they can both happen at the same ti- like, they can both be true.

3563
03:54:10,310 --> 03:54:13,290
Because, like, she- the body's not going anywhere.

3564
03:54:13,910 --> 03:54:15,390
It's still in the back of his trunk.

3565
03:54:15,850 --> 03:54:22,730
Uh, what I'm most surprised by is that how the fuck did she- he sneak the body into his car from all the nurses?

3566
03:54:23,970 --> 03:54:27,050
Wait, she's not in the trunk, she's in the backseat?

3567
03:54:27,610 --> 03:54:29,450
For three days?

3568
03:54:31,710 --> 03:54:32,670
Wait, what?

3569
03:54:34,590 --> 03:54:39,050
I thought when you said, like, in the tru- oh, okay.

3570
03:54:39,750 --> 03:54:43,430
Oh, so she's basically taking her to see- oh, James is a little weird.

3571
03:54:44,190 --> 03:54:46,290
That's- you know what, that's my line.

3572
03:54:46,670 --> 03:54:48,530
All the other stuff, like, I understand.

3573
03:54:48,910 --> 03:54:51,530
Like, medical bills are very hard to pay off.

3574
03:54:51,530 --> 03:55:01,090
Like, I understand medical debt and everything, but, like, him putting her in the back of the- in the backseat and then taking Laura to see her?

3575
03:55:01,310 --> 03:55:02,450
That's a little weird.

3576
03:55:02,830 --> 03:55:04,370
Just a little bit.

3577
03:55:08,610 --> 03:55:11,370
Yeah, that's a bit freaky.

3578
03:55:14,030 --> 03:55:16,470
Anyway, guys, I'm gonna call it here.

3579
03:55:16,950 --> 03:55:18,250
I can't believe we did it, guys.

3580
03:55:18,290 --> 03:55:20,650
We're all here to see me finish Silent Hill 2.

3581
03:55:20,650 --> 03:55:27,110
I have a lot of recordings to do after this, so I'm gonna rest my voice, rest my throat, and finish some recordings.

3582
03:55:27,510 --> 03:55:35,250
As always, everybody, stay hydrated, posture check, get up and move around to get that blood flowing, and if you stood up for me, head to bed, cause you deserve it.

3583
03:55:35,390 --> 03:55:36,750
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

3584
03:55:37,170 --> 03:55:37,890
Bye, guys.

3585
03:55:38,370 --> 03:55:38,730
Bye!

3586
03:55:46,070 --> 03:55:50,150
I forgot to say, if you guys want to check out Hyatt Collection, check it out.

3587
03:55:50,190 --> 03:55:54,810
If you want to support me and Hyatt, I have custom PCKs and keycaps there.

3588
03:55:55,010 --> 03:55:55,270
Whoa!

3589
03:55:55,970 --> 03:55:57,310
My last chill of the day.

3590
03:55:57,450 --> 03:55:57,650
Bye!
